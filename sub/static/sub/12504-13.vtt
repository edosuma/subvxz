Make It or Break It:

00:07.475 --> 00:10.578
- Great idea
putting us together.
- You're good for each other.

00:10.611 --> 00:14.248
It's not in there.
We wouldn't want anyone to
find out about the cortisone.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.583
- What do you want?
- We'll see.

00:15.616 --> 00:19.053
- Where is she?
- Summer's not here. She left.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.589
- Emily, will you
wait for me?
- Yes.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.092
I'll be able to recover in time
for the Olympics, right?

00:24.125 --> 00:26.460
If you do gymnastics,
you may never walk again.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.129
[sobbing] Oh, my God!

00:28.162 --> 00:31.332
- You should be
in that photo.
- I will be, next year.

00:31.365 --> 00:35.436
- As a coach?
- As the new
National champion.

Got a plan tonight *

00:44.545 --> 00:46.514
* Got my girls
Gonna do a little somethin' *

00:46.547 --> 00:48.549
* To the club
in my boyfriend's ride *

00:49.317 --> 00:51.085
[man] Just like that.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.154
Turn your shoulders
to the lens, Nicky.

00:54.488 --> 00:55.856
When will this issue
come out?

00:55.889 --> 00:58.259
It comes out end of January.
It's the March issue.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.861
- Perfect!
- [woman] I love this shot.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.164
- That's great, Kaylie!
- Thanks.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.433
Do you think that Nicky
can kiss her hand?

01:05.466 --> 01:08.502
- Nicky, kiss her hand.
- [sighs] Come on.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.338
Look, isn't it time
for practice?

01:10.371 --> 01:11.639
Do it!

01:11.672 --> 01:13.541
* ...wanna dance
all night long *

01:13.574 --> 01:15.509
* It's girls' night
It's girls' night *

01:15.543 --> 01:17.545
* No boys allowed

01:17.578 --> 01:22.283
* So back up off me
I'll be leaving on my own *

01:22.316 --> 01:24.252
That looks great.

01:24.285 --> 01:28.122
You look like you just
bashed your groin
on the pommel horse.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.524
- Is kissing me
really that bad?
- Hell no, Princess.

01:30.558 --> 01:34.528
All I want to do, every hour
of every day, is kiss
your perfect little paw.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.664
- Seriously,
are we done yet?
- [both] No.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.167
Actually, M.J., we really
need to wrap it up.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.435
I promised Sasha you'd
be gone by the time
practice starts.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.638
- [man] Nicky, can you turn
the shoulder to the lens?
- M.J.?

Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh,
oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh!

01:58.186 --> 02:00.521
We have our own
parking space! [laughs]

02:00.554 --> 02:02.556
[screams] Oh, my gosh!

02:02.590 --> 02:05.593
[Chloe] Do you know
what this means?

02:06.627 --> 02:09.163
We have arrived!

02:09.197 --> 02:12.466
We're a fancy-pantsy
Rock family!

02:13.601 --> 02:15.603
Yup. That's us.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.709
M.J., really?
It's almost 7:00am...

02:21.742 --> 02:23.744
Summer, please. This is
Seventeen Magazine.

02:25.613 --> 02:29.383
She is so selfish,
taking time away
from my practice.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.452
They do make
a cute couple, though.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.587
Do you think
they've hooked up yet?

02:39.460 --> 02:42.663
This is the photo shoot? Wow.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.201
[sighs] I don't see why
she gets a photo shoot.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.537
I did come in fourth.
That's not so far
from first.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.173
And I don't look
bloated in pictures.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.710
What? You can't fake
bone structure.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.513
OK, Sasha is gonna
be here any minute!

03:04.418 --> 03:06.220
I tried to get them
out on time.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.322
I gave them
a two-hour warning,
an hour warning...

03:12.560 --> 03:14.228
Get out!

03:15.263 --> 03:16.530
Now!

03:41.522 --> 03:43.724
Would you like
to explain that?

03:45.626 --> 03:48.262
- What is she doing?
- Thanks to the book
you gave her,

03:48.296 --> 03:51.399
she thinks
she's coming back,
to gymnastics!

03:51.432 --> 03:54.368
Why in the world
are you giving her
that kind of false hope?

03:54.402 --> 03:57.538
It was just to help her
with her recovery.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.540
I had no idea she'd take it
to that extreme.

03:59.573 --> 04:04.244
Well, you know Payson.
Give her an inch,
she takes a small country.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.610
[Lauren] Hey. Payson?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.614
- Payson.
- Yeah?

04:40.648 --> 04:44.752
What on earth are you
doing showing up here
at 7:00 in the morning?

04:47.755 --> 04:49.357
Training.

05:12.813 --> 05:17.651
- Payson?
- Sasha, I just landed
a perfect gainer full.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.366
A gainer full?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.502
I'm visualizing
a new routine.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.836
Staying on my mental game,
you know?

05:35.869 --> 05:38.772
That way, when my back heals,
I'll be ready to go.

05:38.806 --> 05:42.710
Payson, that book
I gave you was to help you
heal your back,

05:42.743 --> 05:44.912
not inspire a return
to gymnastics.

05:44.945 --> 05:48.682
But look! Doug Maclean
came back to the NFL

05:48.716 --> 05:50.718
after he fractured his spine.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.686
And Jade Davis
won the gold in Sydney,

05:52.720 --> 05:54.722
when they told her
she would never come back!

05:54.755 --> 05:57.791
That's true, but they
weren't given the same
prognosis you were.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.760
That's what they told
Jade Davis!

05:59.793 --> 06:04.632
The doctors have told you
that returning to gymnastics
is not an option.

06:04.665 --> 06:09.437
- For you.
You've heard them.
- Yeah. I did.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.809
I mean, you wouldn't think
a few hundred feet
would make a big difference,

06:15.843 --> 06:19.780
but having your own space
right up front is
a lifesaver, let me tell ya.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.752
Right up there between
the Tanners' and the Cruz's.

Hey, Kaylie,
I was just telling Nicky
some exciting news.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.973
There is an A-list
pool party in Los Angeles
this weekend,

06:46.006 --> 06:50.177
and they want to fly you
both in. All expenses paid.
Great exposure!

06:50.210 --> 06:53.581
There will be TV stars,
pro athletes,
and tons of press.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.484
Now I was thinking it'd be
particularly effective
for the two of you

06:56.517 --> 06:58.185
- to walk the red carpet
together.
- Whoa, whoa!

06:58.218 --> 07:02.756
No. No way. OK, M.J.,
I'm not into that stuff.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.993
And by the way,
I'm not loving being
paired up with her.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.929
Especially 'cause
she's not even
a serious gymnast.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.598
No offense, Kaylie.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.934
No offense? Really?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.203
I'm just speaking
the truth, you know.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.706
Well, I've got
some truth for you.

07:18.739 --> 07:22.710
I'm the National Champion.
You are the silver medalist.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.546
- You know...
- Excuse me,
I have to go train.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.649
[rock music playing]

07:37.925 --> 07:39.960
- My head again?
- Yeah.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.763
Try not to throw it back
on the double back.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.766
I heard GK is giving her
a whole line of leos.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.503
Is there any spotlight
she isn't the center of?

07:49.537 --> 07:50.738
Better her than me.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.774
What are you
talking about? You're on
the National Team now.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.709
You have to start
thinking like a winner.

07:55.743 --> 07:59.580
No, I have to train harder,
so next Nationals
I'll actually be the winner.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.948
Then I'll start thinking
like a winner.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.950
It doesn't work
like that.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.553
"What every champion
has in common

08:05.586 --> 08:07.721
is the certainty
that they will reach
their goal,

08:07.755 --> 08:09.723
even if there is no
evidence to support it.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.826
Winners carry themselves
like winners,

08:12.860 --> 08:15.929
- on the court
and in everyday life."

08:15.963 --> 08:19.533
You need to find
your inner winner.
I'll help you.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.802
Now you're starting
to sound like Damon.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.804
[Lauren] Someone's
mooning over Pizza Boy.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.806
Too bad
he's in Los Angeles,

08:25.839 --> 08:29.009
where all
the gorgeous actresses
and supermodels are.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.750
[Summer] So I heard you
and Kim talking today.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.719
- About Payson.
- Yeah?

08:40.120 --> 08:43.657
You guys are so certain
she can't ever come back
to gymnastics.

08:43.691 --> 08:46.594
Well, the doctors are
pretty certain too.

08:46.627 --> 08:51.899
But isn't there a possibility
that some... larger force
might come into play,

08:51.932 --> 08:53.867
that's bigger
than this reality?

08:53.901 --> 08:57.638
Yeah, I don't believe
in larger forces.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.972
I believe in the facts.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.642
So you're basically
a man of no faith.

09:01.675 --> 09:05.345
I have total faith,
in the facts. You know
the good thing about facts

09:05.378 --> 09:08.749
is they don't need
any woo-woo mumbo jumbo
to prop them up.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.954
Well, all righty, then.
I guess I'll go
to the printer.

09:15.756 --> 09:16.757
[chuckles]

09:18.792 --> 09:20.661
- Hey, champ.
- Hey.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.763
I got something for ya.

09:28.769 --> 09:29.970
You did it!

09:30.003 --> 09:33.707
My dad says absolutely
the number one back doctor
in the world

09:33.741 --> 09:36.710
is at UCLA, in Los Angeles.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.012
And if you haven't seen him,
you haven't gotten
the best opinion.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.014
He has a monster
waiting list, though.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.785
But my dad said
he can get you in.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.788
Nicky,
that is so great.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.389
Thank you so much
for doing this for me.

09:49.422 --> 09:53.393
You and me,
we understand each other.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.096
I mean, gymnastics
is our whole life.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.832
I couldn't let it go,
either.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.770
I'm rooting for you,
Payson.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.855
So what's everyone
doing this weekend?

10:21.889 --> 10:24.858
I'm sure Kaylie
has another big photo shoot

10:24.892 --> 10:28.095
or a commercial,
since she's too good
for us now.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.132
Actually, no photo
shoots or commercials.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.202
Um, just a star-studded
pool party.

10:35.235 --> 10:39.807
In Los Angeles.
Via private jet.
All expenses paid.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.441
And guess what?

10:41.474 --> 10:45.445
There's space on the plane,
I can take a couple friends.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.849
Emily, Payson, have
any plans this weekend?

10:48.882 --> 10:52.152
- LA?
- Wow. Really?

11:01.995 --> 11:04.231
[rock music]

11:15.042 --> 11:18.812
So, looking forward
to the big pool party
in LA this weekend?

11:18.846 --> 11:22.115
[scoffs] I'd rather
dive into a swamp
filled with crocodiles.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.718
[laughs] Don't be
so grumpy, Nicky!

11:24.752 --> 11:26.019
We're going to have
a great time.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.964
"We?" What are you saying?

11:36.997 --> 11:40.267
I'm saying I have a vial
of cortisone that you were
illegally handing out

11:40.300 --> 11:42.502
that can get you and
your dad thrown in jail.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.806
Now, compared
to taking that buff
little bod to prison,

11:45.839 --> 11:47.875
is taking me
to a little party
really that bad?

11:47.908 --> 11:51.044
Are you kidding me?
Why do you need me
to take you to the party?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.913
You're invited,
I'm not.

11:52.946 --> 11:56.249
Well, sorry, the jet's full.
I already said I wasn't going

11:56.283 --> 11:58.118
and Kaylie invited
a bunch of people.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.221
Oh, it's OK.
I have my daddy's
airplane miles.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.992
Meet your "plus one."
I think we're gonna make
a very cute couple.

12:12.565 --> 12:16.770
The doctor sounds
extremely qualified,
Payson.

12:16.804 --> 12:20.273
You know we saw some
of the best doctors
in the world in Boston...

12:21.541 --> 12:24.511
...and they all had
the same prognosis.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.879
Your condition
is inoperable.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.982
But we haven't seen
this doctor.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.151
I just don't
want to see you
get your hopes up.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.921
Mom, this doctor
is the best!

12:33.954 --> 12:36.990
And just think about it.
There is a private jet
on a runway

12:37.024 --> 12:38.525
just waiting
to take us to LA,

12:38.558 --> 12:41.895
and Nicky's dad, he can
get me in this weekend.

12:41.929 --> 12:45.933
Don't you see? Everything is
just lining up perfectly,

12:45.966 --> 12:49.069
just like it did
for everyone in the book.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.105
- All right, let's go home
and talk to your father.
- Yes!

13:05.886 --> 13:07.287
What's all that?

13:10.991 --> 13:12.392
It's just stuff.

13:13.994 --> 13:17.597
I'm, uh, taking it
to the Salvation Army.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.531
Are you living
out of your car?

13:18.565 --> 13:22.870
- Yeah. It's only been a week.
- A week?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.571
Look. When I got
kicked out of The Rock,

13:24.604 --> 13:26.974
I went and worked on the ranch
with my father,

13:27.007 --> 13:30.243
which is always what he thought
I should be doing.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.881
So, when Sasha let me back in,

13:33.914 --> 13:36.383
he said that I was "too old
for that gymnastics crap"

13:36.416 --> 13:38.986
and if I wanted to keep
wasting my time with it,

13:39.019 --> 13:40.854
I could find
somewhere else to live.

13:43.290 --> 13:47.194
Well, you can't live
out of your car.
That's ridiculous.

13:47.227 --> 13:51.231
I think... maybe I have an
idea where you could stay.

So what are we
listening to exactly?

13:59.907 --> 14:03.076
It's classical music.
It's my new thing.

14:03.110 --> 14:08.215
I'm just a Rock-mom
listening to Rachmaninoff.

14:08.248 --> 14:11.418
- [Chloe chuckling]
- And why are we doing this?

14:11.451 --> 14:15.288
Because we're living
our best life now.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.423
"Listen to more
classical music."

14:16.456 --> 14:19.292
It's food for the brain.
Check.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.929
Well, all that's
left to do is

14:21.962 --> 14:23.430
"balance your life
with the right mate."

14:23.463 --> 14:25.432
I couldn't agree more.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.300
How's my dating
profile coming?

14:27.334 --> 14:31.038
Almost done. We have
height and... weight?

14:31.071 --> 14:33.873
A hundred... ten pounds.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.309
And education?

14:36.343 --> 14:37.911
Advanced degree.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.014
What?
Beauty college counts.

14:42.049 --> 14:45.018
[Brian] And load the photo...

14:45.052 --> 14:47.654
Are you sure this is
the picture you want to use?

14:47.687 --> 14:51.258
Honey, I know it's
a little dated, but it's
the best one I've got.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.026
[door opens]

14:54.061 --> 14:56.129
What is with the music?

14:56.163 --> 14:59.399
Mom's bettering our lives
in ten easy steps.

14:59.432 --> 15:03.103
Well, I think
I just might have
step one down.

15:03.136 --> 15:07.074
Kaylie invited us to
a party in LA. Can I go?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.109
Well, sure, honey.
How are you gonna get there?

15:10.077 --> 15:12.479
By... private... plane.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.447
With chaperones.

15:14.481 --> 15:18.118
[Chloe screaming] Oh, and you
get to see Damon there too!

15:18.151 --> 15:20.453
Parking spaces, private jets.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.957
Check us out!
We are living it, baby! Woo!

15:26.126 --> 15:29.362
I mean, it's all lined up,
don't we have to take her?

15:29.396 --> 15:30.730
Easy for you to say.

15:30.763 --> 15:35.068
You're going back to Minnesota,
I'll be there, alone,

15:35.102 --> 15:38.338
with Payson when she gets
the bad news. Again.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.407
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.243
At least this time, I know
what's coming and I'll be
ready to buck her up.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.412
I'll be strong. For her.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.247
This will be the final time.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.517
All right,
we have to draw a line,
you know, let her know

15:50.550 --> 15:52.519
this is the very last doctor.

15:52.552 --> 15:56.423
We all can't go
through this again.
Are we agreed?

15:56.456 --> 15:59.526
Yes. We are agreed.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.003
[Lauren] So...

16:11.571 --> 16:15.742
It's not much,
but it beats your car.

16:15.775 --> 16:19.312
What? I'm telling you,
it's fine. No one
ever comes up here.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.215
Stay as long as you want.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.152
Look. I won't even be here.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.288
I've been invited to that
big party in LA. You going?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.790
[chuckles] Uh, no.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.294
That's too bad.
We're all going.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.496
Kaylie's going
with Nicky, you know.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.531
They're the big gymnastics
power couple now.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.575
I'll be gone by the time
you get back from LA.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.354
[rock music]

17:06.326 --> 17:09.562
* Here we

17:09.596 --> 17:14.334
* Are again

17:26.479 --> 17:29.082
Oh, excuse me, can we get
some more towels, please?

17:29.116 --> 17:31.451
You ladies are sure
soaking it up.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.486
[Kaylie] We sure are.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.226
Thanks for coming, guys.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.360
Are you kidding me?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.196
This is the most
amazing day of my life.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.265
Still can't believe
they just bring you
all the towels you want.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.201
And I can't believe
who they got to bring 'em.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.171
I thought you were done
with boys and drama.

17:51.204 --> 17:55.242
Um, maybe just
the drama part.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.478
You know, cutting Lauren
and her negative energy
out of my life

17:58.511 --> 18:00.413
has really helped
with the drama.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.615
I have to say, it is nice
to have a break from her.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.451
No argument here.

18:04.484 --> 18:08.321
Oh, come on, guys.
I think we're being
way too hard on Lauren.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.225
[all laugh]

18:13.226 --> 18:14.694
We might need more towels.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.266
And what are you
thinking about?

18:19.299 --> 18:20.633
I'm guessing Damon.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.235
Are you excited to see him?

18:22.269 --> 18:25.172
I'm so excited
to see him!

18:25.205 --> 18:27.674
Can I tell you guys a secret?

18:27.707 --> 18:30.277
He signed a huge
record deal today.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.544
Damon? Really?

18:31.578 --> 18:34.681
This major band is
going to sing his songs.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.284
He called and said
the meeting went great.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.519
Wow! You're dating,
like, a rock star.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.321
Kinda.

18:41.354 --> 18:45.258
So does this mean
you're giving up on that
other cute pizza boy?

18:45.292 --> 18:47.160
Razor?

18:47.194 --> 18:48.695
We weren't ever even
a thing.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.331
Right.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.437
Mom, you're going to be late.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.539
What was mystery man's
name again?

18:59.572 --> 19:02.575
TanMan65.

19:02.609 --> 19:07.314
How do you think TanMan65's
gonna like this number?

19:07.347 --> 19:09.582
- [man] Ladies, look over here!
- [indistinct shouts]

19:09.616 --> 19:11.318
This is so exciting!

19:11.351 --> 19:12.252
Kinda.

19:12.285 --> 19:16.456
There's James Blake!
And Anna Kournikova!

19:16.489 --> 19:18.325
Wait...

19:18.358 --> 19:20.927
We have to walk this
red carpet by ourselves?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.929
Yeah! It's fun!

19:22.962 --> 19:26.266
[dance music]

19:26.299 --> 19:28.368
[man] Kaylie! Kaylie Cruz!

19:28.401 --> 19:29.669
Here goes nothing.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.773
- [camera shutters clicking]
- [indistinct shouts]

19:35.775 --> 19:36.743
Kaylie, who are you with?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.345
My girlfriends, of course.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.682
Man, she's good at that.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.351
Comes with being at the top.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.686
All right, now you go.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.221
Me?

19:48.255 --> 19:49.256
Go!

19:57.530 --> 19:58.798
Are you anybody?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.201
No.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.519
Oh, thank God.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.262
[gasps]

20:30.363 --> 20:31.798
TanMan65?!

20:36.303 --> 20:37.437
[man] Payson! Payson Keeler!

20:39.306 --> 20:41.641
Payson, how you feeling?
How's the recovery going?

20:44.311 --> 20:46.779
What are you
gonna do now, Payson?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.581
I'm gonna have
a good time at the party.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.716
I will see you all in there.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.618
[dance music continues]

20:53.320 --> 20:56.055
OK. You. What the heck was that?
Get back out there!

20:56.088 --> 20:58.658
- What? No.
- You looked like
a scared little rabbit,

20:58.691 --> 21:00.827
not a National Team member.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.028
Get back out there
and do it again.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.297
What is with you?
You hate this stuff.

21:04.331 --> 21:07.367
What the heck was that
"I'm nobody" business?

21:07.400 --> 21:10.269
You are somebody, Emily.
Go be her.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.342
You know, retirement is
making you really bossy!

21:18.478 --> 21:20.747
Look! It's Emily Kmetko!

21:20.780 --> 21:23.816
[Payson] National Team member,
Emily Kmetko!

21:23.850 --> 21:25.418
[shutters clicking]

21:30.390 --> 21:32.659
[man] Emily!
Hey, Emily, right here!

21:32.692 --> 21:33.893
Give us a smile!

21:35.428 --> 21:36.429
Nice!

21:38.765 --> 21:40.800
* Shake it to me, baby,
shake it to the floor *

21:40.833 --> 21:43.336
- * Shake it 'til you feel it
- * Do you want more

21:43.370 --> 21:45.405
* Shake it to me, baby,
shake it to the floor *

21:45.438 --> 21:47.474
- * Shake it 'til you feel it
- * Do you want more?

21:47.507 --> 21:49.742
* Move it to the ceiling,
move it through the door *

21:49.776 --> 21:51.077
* Move it like
you're stealing *

21:51.110 --> 21:52.144
* Do you want more?

21:52.178 --> 21:54.881
* Shake it to me, baby,
shake it to the floor *

21:54.914 --> 21:57.316
You know, you make
a fantastic entrance.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.886
Yours sucks.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.588
Were you gonna sit
in this plant all night?

22:01.621 --> 22:04.424
That's not what
big LA songwriters do.

22:04.457 --> 22:07.894
They come in all,
"Yo. Check me out, yo. What?"

22:07.927 --> 22:09.696
[both chuckle]

22:09.729 --> 22:10.697
[man] Lauren Tanner!

22:10.730 --> 22:13.933
- [shutters clicking]
- [indistinct shouts]

22:15.167 --> 22:17.937
Uh-oh.
This can't be good.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.707
Nicky Russo!
Is that your girlfriend?

22:20.740 --> 22:24.377
Oh, that's for us to know
and you to find out.

22:27.947 --> 22:33.553
Remember our carefree,
drama-free, Lauren-free weekend?

22:33.586 --> 22:35.522
I think it's...

22:35.555 --> 22:37.557
Over.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.960
You've got to be
flipping kidding me.

22:49.836 --> 22:52.805
Ooh, this is some place.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.442
The menu doesn't even
have prices on it.

22:57.777 --> 23:01.481
Look, we're both busy people,
if you want to leave

23:01.514 --> 23:04.551
then we could just pretend
this never happened.

23:04.584 --> 23:09.556
After all, this was a date
set under false pretenses.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.190
What is that supposed to mean?

23:11.223 --> 23:15.628
Oh, come on.
When was the last time
you were a blonde?

23:15.662 --> 23:18.598
Well, at least
I sent my real picture.

23:18.631 --> 23:22.502
What was yours,
a Calvin Klein model?
Someone has an ego.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.872
I... I posted a picture
that was comparable to me

23:25.905 --> 23:27.507
in looks and stature.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.175
I'm a very influential man
in this town.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.544
I have to protect
my private image.

23:31.578 --> 23:32.545
What?

23:32.579 --> 23:36.583
So you drive those big
ol' monster trucks around

23:36.616 --> 23:39.185
just so you can be
all incognito?

23:39.218 --> 23:42.822
SUVs are very practical cars
for mountain towns.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.857
Do a lot of off-roading
in your Armani suits?

23:44.891 --> 23:46.659
I'd love to get the name
of your dry cleaner.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.462
So, I suppose you wear
dresses that low-cut

23:49.496 --> 23:52.532
because you want men
complimenting your eyes?

23:52.565 --> 23:54.501
Touché, TanMan.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.669
I'm sorry.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.538
That wasn't...

23:58.571 --> 23:59.606
I shouldn't have said that.

23:59.639 --> 24:03.610
Why not? I do have
beautiful eyes.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.913
And that model almost did
have your hairline. [laughs]

24:10.650 --> 24:13.886
Getting reservations
on short notice wasn't easy.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.624
We're here, we might
as well have dinner,

24:17.657 --> 24:20.560
if...
if you're up to it.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.796
I guess it would be a shame
to waste this dress.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.499
It really does makes
my eyes pop, doesn't it?

24:28.568 --> 24:30.703
[dance music]

24:40.913 --> 24:43.516
I still can't believe
Lauren showed up.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.652
- With Nicky.
- [Kaylie] Yeah.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.287
Mr. "I Hate To Party"
cleans up pretty well.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.556
For an android.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.691
Hi, girls!
Great party, right?

24:51.724 --> 24:53.960
What are you doing here?
You were not invited.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.530
Nicky took me
as his plus one.
Wasn't that sweet?

24:57.564 --> 24:59.766
Nicky! So glad
you could make it.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.602
Your host would like
to meet you.
Come on, Kaylie.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.537
Uh, I'll be there in a sec.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.805
Pay, can I talk to you
for a minute?

25:05.838 --> 25:06.839
Yeah.

25:09.642 --> 25:11.844
So, I didn't think
you were coming.

25:11.878 --> 25:15.648
I heard you were
gonna be here, so it
couldn't be all that bad.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.283
Why did you bring
Lauren?

25:17.316 --> 25:20.553
I didn't bring her, OK,
she tagged along. You know her.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.555
You sure looked together.

25:22.589 --> 25:26.659
We're not together. [laughs]
We are absolutely not together.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.661
OK?

25:28.695 --> 25:32.565
Wow. Uh, you look great.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.634
- How are you feeling?
- Fantastic.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.068
When's the doctor's appointment?

25:36.102 --> 25:39.672
Tomorrow. I just...
I know this is
gonna work out.

25:39.706 --> 25:43.075
I do too. It's gonna be great
to have you back.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.612
Nicky. Now?

25:51.618 --> 25:54.887
Tell me about the big
record deal meeting!

25:54.921 --> 25:59.626
It was, uh...
it was great.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.927
Tell me everything.

26:02.762 --> 26:06.032
Are you thirsty? I'm thirsty.
I'll be right back.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.839
Well... I thought
you'd rather die
than miss training.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.373
Or get paired up with me.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.943
This is Mr. Barnett,
your host.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.378
You're right, M.J.
They are quite a couple.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.614
Did you hear that, honey?

26:23.983 --> 26:26.686
Nicky is super shy.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.154
It's one of the things
I love most about him.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.729
Crazy scene, right?

26:36.763 --> 26:38.865
Oh, my gosh.

26:38.898 --> 26:41.768
My brother and I
watched every second
of the Beijing Olympics.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.002
Really?

26:43.035 --> 26:44.203
I had to TiVo it.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.640
Hey... you wanna
get outta here?

26:47.674 --> 26:49.075
What? No.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.712
Oh, sorry, there's just this
cool private after-party,
I just thought...

26:52.745 --> 26:55.782
[Emily] No, thanks.
I'm actually here
with someone.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.383
Ah. I didn't see
anyone with you.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.719
Because I'm just invisible.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.054
Have a good night.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.094
Is something up?

27:09.128 --> 27:10.730
No, hell no.

27:10.763 --> 27:13.199
All right, everybody...
Everybody likes you.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.734
I should be used to that by now.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.903
What's that
supposed to mean?

27:16.936 --> 27:19.205
That guy?
Razor?

27:19.238 --> 27:22.809
Razor? What does he have
to do with anything?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.411
Have you seen him in Boulder?

27:25.444 --> 27:28.147
Yes, we happen
to work together.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.215
Have you lost your mind?

27:29.248 --> 27:31.684
Everywhere you go
there's somebody

27:31.718 --> 27:35.087
that wants to be with you,
which is a lot of fun for me.

27:35.121 --> 27:40.693
Of course, why wouldn't they?
You're a winner. And I'm just...

27:41.728 --> 27:43.229
You're just...?

27:45.832 --> 27:49.135
Damon,
how did the meeting go?

27:55.141 --> 27:57.977
So, those fish
with the heads still on

27:58.010 --> 28:00.179
sure are ugly suckers,
aren't they?

28:00.212 --> 28:02.715
Thank God you didn't
order the rabbit.

28:02.749 --> 28:04.851
Well, they don't leave
the heads on those... too?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.758
Speaking of ugly.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.960
You know, it's not as hard
as you might think

28:13.993 --> 28:16.963
to get a new,
let alone working car.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.866
There are these places
called car dealerships.

28:19.899 --> 28:23.135
Ooh, such tales you spin,
Steve Tanner.

28:23.169 --> 28:26.038
Look, if you're interested,
I could help you find a deal.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.808
And some low-interest
financing.

28:28.841 --> 28:29.842
Really?

28:31.510 --> 28:33.980
That would be nice.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.314
I am trying to up
my level, after all.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.188
- I gotta... I should go.
- Of course. And thanks
for sticking around.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.924
This was actually fun.

28:46.258 --> 28:49.228
Surprisingly so.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.163
- Keep this between us.
- Don't tell anybody
about tonight.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.198
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.301
It's just, because of
the no dating rule and all.

28:55.334 --> 28:58.805
I don't think that rule
applies to parents.

28:58.838 --> 29:02.008
But, yeah,
we wouldn't want anyone
getting the wrong idea.

29:03.910 --> 29:07.780
I should skedaddle before
my engine overheats again.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.782
It's tricky in the dark.

29:10.549 --> 29:11.918
Drive safe, Chloe.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.187
Bye.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.289
[chuckling]

29:19.591 --> 29:21.861
Come on, Kaylie,
just a bit more champagne.

29:21.894 --> 29:25.564
- We have to kill the bottle.
- Well, it is a party.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.567
So we're gonna see you
at the after-party
in the suite, right?

29:28.600 --> 29:30.236
Yeah, I'll be there.

29:36.843 --> 29:39.278
So, there's
an after-party?

29:39.311 --> 29:40.947
Are you kidding me?

29:40.980 --> 29:43.149
First you have the nerve
to show up here

29:43.182 --> 29:45.818
when I distinctly
did not invite you.

29:45.852 --> 29:47.954
And now you want to tag along
to the after-party?

29:47.987 --> 29:49.822
You really are
a piece of work.

29:49.856 --> 29:52.124
Have you been drinking,
Kaylie? You know
how you can get.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.926
What I do is
none of your business.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.327
Where I go is none
of your business.

29:55.361 --> 29:59.098
And this after-party?
Is so none of your business.

30:09.608 --> 30:13.112
See? They have
a Starlight Lounge
here, too.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.855
I'm sorry for being
such an ass, Emily.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.392
I don't get why
you didn't just tell me.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.094
Because I was embarrassed.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.396
What happened?

30:31.898 --> 30:33.132
So, they invite me to the label

30:33.165 --> 30:35.401
because a big act wants
to record my stuff.

30:35.434 --> 30:39.038
I'm thinking...
Smashing Pumpkins,
you know,

30:39.071 --> 30:42.074
- My Chemical Romance...
- And?

30:42.108 --> 30:45.311
And the "big band"
that they want to record
my stuff is Pinky Promise.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.147
Pinky Promise?

30:48.180 --> 30:51.117
Those girls are huge.
They're on every magazine cover.

30:51.150 --> 30:55.421
But they're crap,
they're bubblegum crap.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.289
I said no.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.524
Are you sure?

30:58.557 --> 31:02.161
I mean, you've gotta be
flattered that
somebody that huge...

31:02.194 --> 31:03.362
Whose side are you on?

31:05.364 --> 31:08.000
Listen, I'm sorry.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.335
Emily, I'm...
Gosh, I'm sorry.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.440
Here you are, looking
like such a big deal...

31:21.948 --> 31:25.151
For starters, I had
to train at a lot of
hole-in-the-wall gyms

31:25.184 --> 31:27.319
before I got a shot
at The Rock.

31:27.353 --> 31:31.323
With lousy equipment
and broken lights
and loser coaches.

31:31.357 --> 31:36.328
You seem so upset that one of
the biggest groups in the world
wants to record your stuff.

31:36.362 --> 31:41.300
I'm sorry, but I don't see
why that's so... awful.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.936
Now I really feel
like an ass.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.942
Can I ask you a question?

31:52.111 --> 31:54.413
Why can't you just
sing your own songs?

31:56.382 --> 31:58.284
I'm not as brave as you.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.387
[rock music playing]

32:14.466 --> 32:16.035
[man] Hold the elevator!

32:16.068 --> 32:18.237
Pro athletes, private party,
drugs, it's a goldmine.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.239
Room 234.
Betcha I get it.

32:20.272 --> 32:23.242
No way. It's mine.
One good shot could be
worth a million.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.410
I gotta finance my divorce.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.213
Take this elevator,
I forgot my lip gloss.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.273
You are kidding me.
What in the hell
are you doing here?

32:54.306 --> 32:55.774
Come with me. Now!

32:55.807 --> 32:56.775
I'll explain later.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.310
This better be good.

33:02.048 --> 33:04.050
[indistinct shouting]

33:11.090 --> 33:13.392
Hey. You left before
saying goodnight.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.527
You were busy with press
and everything, so...

33:15.561 --> 33:19.398
Well, I just wanted
to tell you good luck,
with the doctor tomorrow.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.168
You know what? Tomorrow's
gonna be one of the
biggest days of my life.

33:22.201 --> 33:25.137
I just... I know it,
I know it inside.

33:25.171 --> 33:30.142
And Sasha doesn't believe it,
my mom doesn't believe it,
but...

33:30.176 --> 33:32.211
...you believe it.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.780
You're the one person
that believes Dr. Griffo
is the answer

33:34.813 --> 33:36.282
and that I'm coming back.

33:36.315 --> 33:39.251
And I can't tell you
what that means to me.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.789
You know, it's funny,

33:43.822 --> 33:47.826
'cause we've been
training together
for years now, right?

33:47.859 --> 33:51.430
And I've always
just kinda thought of you
as one of the guys.

33:51.463 --> 33:56.835
But one day I looked up
in the air and there you were,

33:56.868 --> 34:00.472
like, six feet up in the air
doing this massive triple-full.

34:00.506 --> 34:03.475
It takes so much power to do
that move like you do it.

34:06.112 --> 34:08.480
And when you landed?

34:08.514 --> 34:12.384
It was like... [chuckles]
you were a butterfly.

34:14.853 --> 34:18.390
There was something so right
about me and you being
number one, wasn't there?

34:19.625 --> 34:20.626
Yeah.

34:36.642 --> 34:41.280
Goodnight, butterfly.
I'll see you back at The Rock.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.514
Goodnight.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.556
I think my heart's
finally stopped pounding.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.859
How did you know
they were coming?

34:53.892 --> 34:54.960
I heard them in the elevator,

34:54.993 --> 34:57.529
and I pressed all the buttons
so they'd take a while.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.531
Then I just took
the other one.

34:59.565 --> 35:02.334
Wow, you, um...

35:02.368 --> 35:04.670
You saved my ass.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.538
I really don't know
what to say.

35:08.574 --> 35:14.313
Look, I know I did
a horrible, horrible thing.

35:14.346 --> 35:18.284
Sleeping with Carter.
It was unforgivable.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.187
Even though we weren't
friends at the time.

35:22.454 --> 35:26.325
I know you hate me for it,
but let me tell you,

35:26.358 --> 35:28.327
it wasn't exactly
the best night of my life.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.430
Hey, I don't need
the details.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.299
Just listen.

35:33.332 --> 35:36.402
I didn't plan it,
everyone was against me,

35:36.435 --> 35:39.505
I'd been drinking,
I wasn't thinking.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.708
It was quick and weird,
and when it was all over with,
I felt like crap.

35:42.741 --> 35:45.411
Oh, I thought you said
it was so empowering...

35:45.444 --> 35:49.448
I know what I said,
but think about it.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.683
Would that be the way you wanted
to lose your virginity?

35:53.352 --> 35:57.356
The guy didn't love me,
there was no one to tell,

35:57.389 --> 36:01.527
and it wasn't empowering.
Not even close.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.594
[sniffles]

36:02.628 --> 36:07.599
And worse than all of that
was losing my best friend.

36:09.701 --> 36:14.340
We've been friends
for ten years. And...

36:16.275 --> 36:20.479
...I know I did
one horrible thing,

36:20.512 --> 36:22.614
but I am your best friend.

36:22.648 --> 36:26.318
I hope
I proved it tonight.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.421
I missed you, too.

36:32.391 --> 36:36.262
There are a lot of things
I miss, actually.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.667
But, I don't know.

36:44.636 --> 36:49.808
I guess... we can
see how it goes.

36:53.579 --> 36:56.382
Just one thing.

36:56.415 --> 37:01.987
Just don't have anything
to do with Carter, OK?

37:02.020 --> 37:04.290
I don't want that
thrown in my face.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.358
You miss him?

37:10.696 --> 37:13.432
I promise to have
nothing to do with Carter.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.678
We better get you back.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.518
Look, Damon...

37:34.453 --> 37:38.324
It's really important to me
that you don't keep anything
from me ever again.

37:40.326 --> 37:41.627
I don't care if you're a star

37:41.660 --> 37:44.463
or a guy that works
at the Pizza Shack.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.664
You can't lie to me.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.036
I've been thinking.

37:51.069 --> 37:56.308
Having...
Having Pinky Promise
record a song or two

37:56.342 --> 37:59.345
might not be the worst
thing in the world.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.315
You are going to be
the biggest songwriter in LA.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.651
And you are the next
Olympic gold medalist.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.854
Let's make a pact.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.389
What kind of pact?

38:11.490 --> 38:15.561
Let's make a pact
to both go for it,

38:15.594 --> 38:17.663
really go for it.

38:17.696 --> 38:21.099
And to totally support
each other in our dreams.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.369
And to always
tell the truth.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.103
A pact it is.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.406
Pinky promise?

38:29.508 --> 38:30.909
[Emily giggles]

38:33.512 --> 38:35.414
I'm going to go back there...

38:36.782 --> 38:37.849
...and get that deal.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.419
I'm so proud of you.

38:42.721 --> 38:47.593
And I... am going
back to Boulder.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.149
Dr. Griffo will be
with you in a moment.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.553
And are these
your X-rays? Yes.

39:14.586 --> 39:15.754
What did he say?

39:15.787 --> 39:17.523
He said
they were interesting.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.659
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.927
Interesting.

39:26.164 --> 39:28.366
Payson, Mrs. Keeler.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.970
Now... [sighs]

39:32.971 --> 39:35.541
We've taken a new series
of X-rays,

39:35.574 --> 39:37.809
which I've examined
at great length.

39:37.843 --> 39:41.680
I also just got off the phone
with Dr. Turner, in Boston.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.449
[Kim] You talked
to Dr. Turner?

39:43.482 --> 39:45.717
Well, I had a question
or two for her.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.154
And we're in agreement.

39:49.187 --> 39:52.991
Your condition is
unfortunately inoperable.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.832
I'll give you a moment.

40:27.626 --> 40:31.763
Ooh! Honey! How was it?
Tell me everything!

40:31.797 --> 40:33.832
[sighs] Pretty amazing.

40:33.865 --> 40:37.002
In private planes, they have
all this incredible food

40:37.035 --> 40:39.204
and these huge plush chairs.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.740
Ooh! Well, did you know
that in some restaurants,

40:41.773 --> 40:43.675
they don't even have
the prices on the menu?

40:43.709 --> 40:45.544
What were you up to
this weekend?

40:45.577 --> 40:50.949
Me? Oh, nothing. Humdrum.
Nothin' going on here.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.885
So, how's the upleveling
going?

40:53.919 --> 40:58.624
Any new CDs or food
or new outfits?

40:58.657 --> 41:02.060
No, but as a matter of fact,
something better.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.997
- New artwork?
- Better!

41:08.800 --> 41:10.035
New doormat?

41:10.068 --> 41:12.070
Better. Look!

41:15.073 --> 41:16.041
What?

41:16.074 --> 41:18.577
That Kia Sorento.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.613
It's not a private plane,
but it's kinda sexy, right?

41:21.647 --> 41:23.048
We have a new car?

41:23.081 --> 41:25.016
It's not a car,
it's a crossover.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.619
I can start it by
pressing a button!

41:27.653 --> 41:29.087
[both screaming]

41:30.088 --> 41:32.057
Mom, this is so amazing!

41:32.090 --> 41:33.825
Wait a minute.
Can we afford this?

41:33.859 --> 41:36.261
Yes, we can!
I figured it all out.
It wasn't that hard.

41:36.294 --> 41:39.064
We can't be pulling
into our new spot in that
old beater, can we?

41:39.097 --> 41:40.666
Now get in!

41:42.100 --> 41:44.603
[Chloe] Don't put your feet
on the new seats, hon!

41:44.636 --> 41:47.038
[* Ingrid Michaelson:
Are We There Yet]

41:48.974 --> 41:53.745
* They say there's linings
made of silver *

41:55.847 --> 42:00.118
* Folded inside
each raining cloud *

42:02.721 --> 42:06.992
* Well, we need
someone to deliver *

42:08.359 --> 42:13.098
* Our silver lining now

42:16.635 --> 42:19.004
Look. I'm sorry
I'm still here.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.006
I couldn't find
anyplace else.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.874
I told you.
Stay as long as you want.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.011
Look, I don't think
it would be a good idea

42:26.044 --> 42:27.879
for people to know
I'm staying here.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.048
And by "people"
you mean Kaylie?

42:30.081 --> 42:32.851
- I just...
- It's OK. I totally agree.

42:32.884 --> 42:37.122
No one needs to know
you're staying here,
especially Kaylie.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.890
I promise.

42:42.894 --> 42:46.998
* Until somebody else
loves you *

42:49.768 --> 42:51.637
* Well, I am waiting...

42:51.670 --> 42:53.071
[Kim] You came back.

42:54.172 --> 42:56.007
Yeah, when I heard.

43:04.149 --> 43:05.884
[sobbing]

43:09.888 --> 43:13.024
* And are we there yet?

43:13.058 --> 43:15.761
* And are we there yet?

43:15.794 --> 43:17.929
* And are we...

43:17.963 --> 43:20.966
I'm gonna go put on
some pajamas.

43:22.133 --> 43:25.837
* Home, home, home

43:25.871 --> 43:27.605
* Where you

43:28.707 --> 43:30.776
* Will lie on the rug

43:30.809 --> 43:32.077
Oh, honey.

43:35.146 --> 43:37.015
I let myself hope.

43:39.885 --> 43:45.023
Damn it, I knew better,
but for one moment...

43:45.056 --> 43:48.860
I let myself hope.
[sobbing]

43:48.894 --> 43:52.664
* This is too much

43:52.698 --> 43:57.168
* 'Cause this is too much

43:57.202 --> 44:00.438
* For me to hold

44:00.471 --> 44:03.809
* This is too much

44:03.842 --> 44:06.978
* For me to hold

44:11.149 --> 44:13.151
[cell phone ringing]

44:18.056 --> 44:19.190
[beeping]

44:20.191 --> 44:23.795
* Home, home, home

44:23.829 --> 44:27.833
* Home

44:30.268 --> 44:33.471
* And are we there yet?

44:33.504 --> 44:37.075
[sobbing]

44:37.108 --> 44:40.478
* And are we there yet?

44:40.511 --> 44:43.715
* And are we there *
