WEBVTT

00:05.069 --> 00:07.737
I'd like to talk with you about
that letter of recommendation

00:07.771 --> 00:10.139
to my alma mater,
Clementine College.

00:10.173 --> 00:11.774
Are you gonna write me that letter?

00:12.334 --> 00:14.460
A good recommendation from
you will guarantee me a spot

00:14.495 --> 00:17.743
in that corral.

00:17.778 --> 00:20.963
Look, Justin, I know the
teenage years are about

00:20.998 --> 00:22.775
your search for an identity.

00:22.809 --> 00:25.888
But the western thing, that's mine.

00:27.126 --> 00:28.800
Sorry, Mr. Litate.

00:29.035 --> 00:32.518
Now, we need a director for the
school's production of Peter Pan.

00:32.552 --> 00:35.730
And I think that
director should be you.

00:35.765 --> 00:38.370
Pull it off,
and I'll write that letter.

00:38.405 --> 00:41.081
Uh, no offense, but isn't
that kind of blackmail?

00:41.115 --> 00:43.957
Blackmail is just the
sort of thing they teach

00:43.992 --> 00:46.731
at good old Clementine College.

00:46.766 --> 00:50.106
Except they call it "ethics."

00:50.140 --> 00:52.979
Good luck, Mr. Director.

00:53.013 --> 00:56.188
People are already talking about
you direing the school play.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.831
That's perfect. I got the
role of Peter Pan in the can!

00:59.866 --> 01:01.835
Uh, not so fast, Zeke.

01:01.869 --> 01:04.340
I need to find the best
actor by holding auditions.

01:04.373 --> 01:06.914
Uh, well that's perfect.
I have just the audition piece.

01:06.948 --> 01:09.219
I took my report on
Mexico's economy,

01:09.253 --> 01:11.722
set the whole thing to music.
Check it out.

01:11.756 --> 01:15.762
* Mexico, Mexico *

01:15.796 --> 01:19.268
* Is a unique and
emerging marketplace *

01:19.303 --> 01:21.439
* Ohhh Mexico! *

01:21.474 --> 01:22.976
* Ohhh Mexico! *

01:23.011 --> 01:24.378
- I gotcha.
- * Mexico... *

01:24.413 --> 01:26.783
I got it. Yeah.

01:26.817 --> 01:29.586
Auditions will be tomorrow.

01:31.190 --> 01:32.726
Please bring something else.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.473 --> 01:43.040
Tribeca Prep,

01:43.074 --> 01:45.476
autions for a Justin Russo
production of Peter Pan

01:45.511 --> 01:47.647
will be held tomorw.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.318
And since I have your attention,

01:50.953 --> 01:54.654
I'm closing in on who put my gym
clothes on the roof. Eric Winer.

01:54.688 --> 01:57.357
Yeah!

02:00.329 --> 02:03.967
Miss Russo. I was filing
your delinquent slip

02:04.001 --> 02:05.570
when I noticed you hadn't fulfilled

02:05.604 --> 02:07.940
your extracurricular requirement.

02:07.974 --> 02:12.478
So I signed you up for
Locker Refurbish Club.

02:14.282 --> 02:15.883
No, thanks.

02:16.051 --> 02:20.490
Perhaps you'd like me to define
the word "requirement" for you.

02:20.524 --> 02:24.128
- No, thanks.
- You have to!

02:24.163 --> 02:28.636
You can't be too busy
being cute or charming,

02:28.670 --> 02:32.072
and being you is not
a full-time job.

02:32.107 --> 02:36.812
Well, the thing is...

02:36.846 --> 02:38.548
Um...

02:38.582 --> 02:41.552
I'm gonna be in my brother's play.

02:41.586 --> 02:44.255
And you know how I'm
always telling you things

02:44.289 --> 02:46.625
and then later on,
you find out they aren't true?

02:46.659 --> 02:49.762
That's 'cause I'm a good actor.

02:50.931 --> 02:54.501
So you're too busy
in the school play

02:54.536 --> 02:56.604
to be in Locker Refurbish Club?

02:56.639 --> 02:59.475
Well, I was ready to take on both,

02:59.509 --> 03:01.878
but you make an excellent point.

03:01.913 --> 03:03.113
Glad we had this talk.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.988
* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

03:09.090 --> 03:11.024
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

03:11.526 --> 03:13.260
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

03:13.294 --> 03:14.761
* Yes please *

03:14.929 --> 03:16.765
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

03:17.199 --> 03:18.900
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

03:19.302 --> 03:21.036
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

03:21.070 --> 03:22.571
* That's what I said *

03:22.672 --> 03:26.543
* Everything is not what it seems *

03:26.577 --> 03:29.579
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

03:29.614 --> 03:33.283
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

03:33.317 --> 03:37.888
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

03:37.922 --> 03:41.191
* Everything is not what it seems *

03:41.226 --> 03:45.163
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

03:45.197 --> 03:48.734
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

03:48.768 --> 03:52.905
* Because everything is not *

03:52.939 --> 03:54.109
* What it seems *

03:54.110 --> 04:00.110

04:00.615 --> 04:01.416
Hey, what are you up to, Max?

04:01.451 --> 04:04.353
Well, I'm the new reviewer
for the school newspaper.

04:04.887 --> 04:07.388
I've always known you
had promise, honey.

04:07.422 --> 04:08.890
Now I know what it was for.

04:10.626 --> 04:13.294
But if only I could think
of something to review...

04:13.328 --> 04:16.930
Hmm. - Like a movie called
Elasto-Man Snaps Back,

04:16.964 --> 04:20.500
playing at 3:45 or 4:15.

04:20.534 --> 04:22.368
You know, you're right.

04:22.402 --> 04:25.137
A writer needs inspiration.
I'll take you.

04:25.172 --> 04:26.872
Let me finish this order, OK?

04:30.009 --> 04:32.010
And that is how you get your mom

04:32.044 --> 04:35.279
to take you to the
movies before homework.

04:37.349 --> 04:40.150
Mom, did you hear that?
He's using his school activities

04:40.184 --> 04:41.885
to get you to take
him to the movies.

04:42.253 --> 04:44.320
No, honey. I'm using
his school activities

04:44.354 --> 04:46.188
to cut my shift in half.

04:49.059 --> 04:51.393
Harper, you know how you
said you loved the theater?

04:51.428 --> 04:53.128
I never said I loved the theater.

04:53.463 --> 04:56.331
Oh, I just assumed, the way you
dress in all those costumes.

04:57.766 --> 04:59.634
Costumes?

04:59.668 --> 05:02.336
OK, let's start over.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.671
I'm gonna be an understudy
in Justin's play.

05:04.705 --> 05:08.007
It should be easy because I
understudy for most things.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.775
But understudies only get on stage

05:09.810 --> 05:11.944
if the other actor
gets sick or injured.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.747
Exactly. And you have perfect school
attendance because you never get sick.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.983
That's why you're gonna be Tinker
Bell and I'm gonna be your understudy.

05:19.017 --> 05:22.086
Alex, you and I being involved in the
same activity is not a good idea.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.887
You know how competitive I am.

05:24.189 --> 05:27.024
I'll crush you like a bug,
just like I did in Skee-Ball.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.393
OK, let's try this again.

05:30.427 --> 05:34.129
You play Tinker Bell. I'm your
understudy. You'll never miss.

05:34.164 --> 05:36.098
I'll never go on. Everyone's happy.

05:36.199 --> 05:39.400
OK, I guess we're not competing.
'Cause I will crush you.

05:41.370 --> 05:43.437
Why don't you go upstairs
and start my homework.

05:43.472 --> 05:45.005
I'll make us some sandwiches.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.207
Oh, thanks, Alex.
That's so generous of you.

05:50.544 --> 05:53.681
One Italian sub and a
tuna salad on wheat.

05:53.715 --> 05:55.182
Got it!

05:57.985 --> 06:00.353
- Hey, Justin.
- Hey, what's up?

06:00.387 --> 06:02.288
Oh, just makin' some sandwiches.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.124
That's a nice dollhouse.

06:06.159 --> 06:08.927
It's a diorama for the school play.

06:08.961 --> 06:12.696
Ah, that's right.
I heard you were directing that.

06:12.730 --> 06:17.265
So, uh, who were you thinking
for Tinker Bell's understudy?

06:17.299 --> 06:19.600
Oh... Tinker Bell's understudy.

06:19.634 --> 06:22.602
You want to be Tinker Bell's
understudy. Well, um...

06:22.637 --> 06:24.771
You're gonna have to
audition like everyone else.

06:24.805 --> 06:27.406
Why? You know I'm a good actor.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.842
I've been acting like
I like you for years.

06:29.876 --> 06:31.977
No one thinks you like me.

06:32.011 --> 06:33.945
But I really do and
I act like I don't.

06:33.979 --> 06:35.746
Pshh! That's acting.

06:37.382 --> 06:39.216
Alex, your order's up. Which table?

06:39.250 --> 06:40.584
Oh, I'll take those.

06:40.618 --> 06:42.252
Aw, that's my girl, always helping.

06:42.420 --> 06:45.522
Mom's helping Max.
Alex is serving sandwiches.

06:45.556 --> 06:48.792
Where would we be
without our ladies?

06:49.861 --> 06:53.829
Um... So, what do we
got going on here?

06:53.864 --> 06:55.498
I'm directing the school play.

06:55.532 --> 06:58.867
Ah, my son's a director.
That's fantastic!

06:58.901 --> 07:00.601
I don't know if you
know this about me,

07:00.636 --> 07:03.103
but I've dabbled in
the theatre arts.

07:03.137 --> 07:04.737
- You, Dad?
- Oh, yeah.

07:05.072 --> 07:07.538
I directed a lot of high school
plays when I was your age.

07:07.573 --> 07:12.142
And as a fellow director,
I'm gonna make sure that you succeed.

07:12.176 --> 07:14.778
Any questions,
you come to your old man.

07:14.812 --> 07:18.547
I have one. Should I let Alex
be Tinker Bell's understudy?

07:18.582 --> 07:21.416
Which one of these
is the understudy?

07:21.451 --> 07:23.450
Uh...

07:23.484 --> 07:26.186
- This one?
- Yeah.

07:28.422 --> 07:31.057
- Got it?
- Oh, yeah.

07:34.928 --> 07:37.729
I just always wanna be a
little boy and to have fun.

07:37.764 --> 07:39.596
This world moves pretty fast,
you know.

07:39.831 --> 07:41.797
It's not long before
you're carrying a briefcase

07:41.831 --> 07:44.465
and heading to work,
day in and day out. For what?

07:44.500 --> 07:46.333
These are the best
days of our lives.

07:46.468 --> 07:49.436
Have a great summer.
I'll see you guys next year!

07:54.407 --> 07:56.908
Was that your eighth
grade graduation speech?

07:56.943 --> 07:59.377
I was told it was inspiring.

07:59.411 --> 08:01.878
And it was!

08:03.047 --> 08:05.382
The role of Peter Pan
goes to Zeke Beakerman.

08:05.416 --> 08:08.118
Whoo! Yes!

08:10.421 --> 08:13.155
Next up, reading for the
role of Tinker Bell is...

08:14.424 --> 08:16.858
Harper Finkle.

08:16.893 --> 08:20.228
No, it is poison!

08:22.397 --> 08:25.265
"Oh, Tink. Did you drink
the medicine to save me?"

08:25.299 --> 08:26.833
Yes!

08:28.001 --> 08:30.869
"But, why, Tink? Now,
you don't look so good."

08:30.904 --> 08:32.937
I think I might get well again,

08:32.972 --> 08:36.106
if the boys and girls
believed in fairies.

08:46.916 --> 08:49.517
- What was that?
- Fairy dust.

08:49.551 --> 08:51.218
Cheese puff powder.

08:58.257 --> 09:00.325
Look. Great.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.560
She was pretty good.

09:02.595 --> 09:07.831
The role of Tinker Bell
goes to Harper Finkle.

09:12.402 --> 09:13.702
Now, the only thing left

09:13.904 --> 09:16.138
is auditions for Tinker
Bell's understudy.

09:16.173 --> 09:19.474
Look, Alex, um...

09:19.509 --> 09:21.776
I spoke to some people in
the directing community.

09:21.810 --> 09:23.844
People who are very close to me,
and they advised me

09:24.412 --> 09:26.746
letting you anywhere near this
production would be sure disaster.

09:26.781 --> 09:29.349
People close to you?
So that means Zeke or Dad.

09:29.383 --> 09:31.818
Oh, it wasn't me, Alex. I swear.

09:32.986 --> 09:35.487
Oh, so then,
Dad's directing this play.

09:35.521 --> 09:37.456
No, I am. I make my own decisions.

09:37.490 --> 09:38.590
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.525
- Prove it.
- Fine. Watch.

09:40.559 --> 09:43.361
Alex Russo's the understudy.
There. I showed you.

09:43.395 --> 09:45.596
- Well, I don't want to do it.
- You have to. I'm the director.

09:45.764 --> 09:49.232
- OK, then fine. I'll do it.
- Good.

09:49.266 --> 09:51.067
Ha.

09:51.101 --> 09:52.968
Listen up, cast.

09:53.002 --> 09:54.903
I need everyone to stay
healthy for the show.

09:55.204 --> 09:57.839
Yes. That's right. Because I
don't want to have to step in.

09:57.873 --> 10:02.342
I have very little interest in this, and
I've never even been to this part of the
school.

10:02.376 --> 10:03.810
OK, here are the ground rules.

10:04.078 --> 10:06.211
Save your voice,
don't do anything dangerous,

10:06.246 --> 10:08.347
and that includes tap-dancing.

10:08.381 --> 10:09.915
- Aww.
- Hmm.

10:09.950 --> 10:10.983
You got it, chief.

10:12.452 --> 10:14.654
I'm gonna start being
careful right now.

10:14.688 --> 10:16.356
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

10:16.390 --> 10:18.658
Oh. That was close.

10:18.692 --> 10:21.727
I almost slipped on my
cheddar cheese fairy dust.

10:23.897 --> 10:26.297
Ooof!

10:26.332 --> 10:29.266
- Harper, are you OK?
- I don't know.

10:29.301 --> 10:31.502
Is my foot supposed
to bend this way?

10:34.039 --> 10:37.541
Whoa. Looks like a rider
got thrown off her horse.

10:37.575 --> 10:41.777
Sit tight, little filly.
The nurse is on her way.

10:41.811 --> 10:46.947
She was Tinker Bell. Now, I'm gonna
have to hold auditions all over again.

10:46.982 --> 10:48.681
Don't you have an understudy?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.518
I'd rather not say.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.987
Alex is my understudy.

10:56.021 --> 11:00.824
Alex, congratulations.
You get to saddle up for the rodeo.

11:02.325 --> 11:04.360
Out of my way. I gotta
throw myself off the stage.

11:04.394 --> 11:05.928
Make some room!

11:05.963 --> 11:08.131
You're in the show, Alex.

11:13.936 --> 11:15.736
Working on your review, Max?

11:15.770 --> 11:18.905
I'm so glad you finally found
something you're half-good at.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.307
Right, here it is...

11:21.341 --> 11:24.442
"I saw Elasto-Man Snaps
Back with my mom last night,

11:24.477 --> 11:28.044
which was a big mistake, because she
didn't put enough butter on the popcorn.

11:28.079 --> 11:30.913
And that's the Max View."

11:32.682 --> 11:37.452
Dad, I gotta talk to you about the play.
I got a big problem.

11:37.486 --> 11:39.554
As long as it doesn't involve Alex,

11:39.588 --> 11:41.889
there's nothing we can't solve.
Lay it on me.

11:42.791 --> 11:45.458
- Never mind.
- Oh, it's Alex?

11:45.492 --> 11:46.759
What did I say to you?

11:47.060 --> 11:48.660
You made her the understudy,
didn't you?

11:48.962 --> 11:51.496
It's not as bad as it seems.
I still got my main man, Zeke,

11:51.530 --> 11:53.197
dialed in on the role of Peter Pan.

11:53.298 --> 11:56.400
He'll just have to
carry the entire show.

11:56.434 --> 11:58.135
Hey, Justin.

11:59.839 --> 12:02.307
Uh, there's something
I gotta tell ya.

12:02.342 --> 12:05.076
What did I say? No tap-dancing!

12:05.110 --> 12:07.077
I wasn't. I went to
tap-dancing class

12:07.112 --> 12:08.579
to tell them I couldn't make it.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.280
But then clog-dancing
class started.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.414
And I was like, "Oh,
man! Clogging?"

12:12.449 --> 12:14.149
And I fell off my shoes.

12:15.751 --> 12:17.618
All right, all right. Nobody panic.

12:17.753 --> 12:21.522
I said I was gonna help you,
and I am gonna help you.

12:21.557 --> 12:24.124
- I'm gonna play Peter Pan.
- Dad...

12:24.159 --> 12:26.693
If I shave twice in the morning,

12:26.727 --> 12:30.029
throw on my letterman jacket,
I can pass as a high school senior.

12:30.063 --> 12:32.965
We'll just say I'm your cousin
visiting from the country.

12:32.999 --> 12:35.333
A country of what, old dudes?

12:37.569 --> 12:39.738
- I can still do it.
- Thank you.

12:39.772 --> 12:43.676
I'll catch you at rehearsal.

12:43.711 --> 12:46.512
This will never work.
I won't get Laritate's recommendation,

12:46.546 --> 12:48.380
I'm not gonna get into
Clementine College,

12:48.415 --> 12:51.216
and I can kiss robotic
engineering goodbye.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.718
Justin, are you talking
about kissing robots again?

12:53.753 --> 12:56.087
You're gonna get
electrocuted eventually.

12:57.623 --> 13:00.290
Alex, you need to
take this seriously.

13:00.325 --> 13:03.893
Your brother needs you to be the
best Tinker Bell you can be.

13:03.928 --> 13:07.296
His college career
is depending on you.

13:07.330 --> 13:08.664
You're right, Daddy.

13:08.999 --> 13:11.266
Justin's depending on me,
and you're depending on me.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.268
I gotta do whatever I need to
do to not let you guys down.

13:20.106 --> 13:23.308
Hiring a real fairy to play your part is
less work than playing the part yourself?

13:23.342 --> 13:25.076
Harper, there's not enough room

13:25.110 --> 13:27.878
to write 27 lines of
dialogue on my hand.

13:29.747 --> 13:33.349
Welcome to Fairy World.
May all your dreams come true.

13:39.755 --> 13:43.157
Hi. - Look, Sparkles won't
work under these conditions!

13:43.191 --> 13:45.525
Her wings need to be
massaged and steamed.

13:45.559 --> 13:48.861
Those things are her
money-makers. Come on!

13:48.896 --> 13:52.297
Last time I send a dwarf to do
an elf's job. How can I help?

13:53.699 --> 13:55.500
I need to hire a fairy actress.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.169
Well, you have come
to the right place.

13:57.303 --> 13:58.803
Of all the fairy talent agencies,

13:58.838 --> 14:02.573
FTA has, by far,
the fanciest offices.

14:02.607 --> 14:06.142
I should sit down.

14:06.176 --> 14:08.411
And some advice:
don't tile your cast.

14:08.445 --> 14:10.946
It's like lugging
around a bathroom wall.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.514
Don't sit there!

14:14.583 --> 14:15.950
It's just for looks.

14:16.051 --> 14:18.219
It's made entirely of
gum drops and licorice.

14:19.354 --> 14:21.888
Who'd mix candy with furniture?

14:21.922 --> 14:25.091
Oh, wait. I would.

14:26.293 --> 14:28.726
Here are some pictures of fairies.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.227
- OK.
- Do you see one you like?

14:35.564 --> 14:38.233
Anyone really standing out?

14:38.267 --> 14:41.469
Anyone popping for you?

14:42.871 --> 14:44.904
These are pictures
of the same fairy.

14:44.939 --> 14:46.438
You have a good eye.

14:46.740 --> 14:48.673
If it's Flutter you want,
then Flutter you've got.

14:50.108 --> 14:51.976
OK. How soon can she start?

14:57.114 --> 14:59.615
You're girls.

14:59.650 --> 15:01.784
I'm Flutter.

15:02.752 --> 15:04.286
Well, this is working out.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.288
Let's all get to know each other.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.256
No, Harper!

15:09.691 --> 15:13.695
You're clumsy.

15:21.469 --> 15:25.238
See, Harper?
She looks just like me.

15:25.272 --> 15:29.509
OK, you're gonna play me,
playing Tinker Bell in the play.

15:29.543 --> 15:32.445
All right. Let's try a
scene from the play.

15:32.479 --> 15:36.615
I'm tired of playing fairies.

15:36.650 --> 15:40.285
I want to play a cop.
Hands up where I can see 'em, pal!

15:40.319 --> 15:42.052
Oh, she's a good actress.

15:42.087 --> 15:44.321
- I can't see 'em.
- Oh!

15:47.058 --> 15:50.259
Flutter, you are a fairy.
Fairies play fairies.

15:50.294 --> 15:51.994
I don't know, Alex.

15:52.029 --> 15:54.797
This fairy wants to play a cop,
and she's packing heat.

15:54.798 --> 15:56.599
I say we let her.

15:59.369 --> 16:01.770
Who's this?

16:03.439 --> 16:05.507
That's Harper.

16:07.176 --> 16:10.210
No. Who's the one with the wings?

16:10.244 --> 16:13.879
Oh, that's Flutter.

16:15.815 --> 16:18.583
You're a man, and you're a lady.

16:20.118 --> 16:21.919
What is a fairy doing here?

16:23.121 --> 16:26.556
She is leaving. Come on, Flutter.

16:26.591 --> 16:27.925
A second ago,

16:28.059 --> 16:30.093
you wanted me to play
the role of Tinker Bell.

16:30.127 --> 16:32.261
You smuggled a fairy
across Never Land lines

16:32.295 --> 16:34.229
to impersonate you in
your brother's play?

16:34.363 --> 16:37.298
I'm no wizard,
but that sounds like a crime.

16:37.332 --> 16:40.133
It's not a crime.

16:40.167 --> 16:43.235
And I suppose you spent all
this time working on this scheme

16:43.269 --> 16:44.936
instead of learning your lines?

16:44.971 --> 16:47.205
I don't think I should answer that

16:47.239 --> 16:49.641
until I'm assigned a
Never Land attorney.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.744
Alex, we're not in a
crime drama right now.

16:53.779 --> 16:56.880
Oh! But if we are,
can I play the cop?

16:56.914 --> 16:59.349
Check this out.
Hands up pal, freeze!

17:01.152 --> 17:02.519
Up against the wall.

17:05.289 --> 17:07.290
Spread 'em, punk.

17:07.324 --> 17:09.959
She's good.

17:12.660 --> 17:15.026
Tink, no! What are you doing?

17:15.060 --> 17:16.794
Peter Pan,

17:16.828 --> 17:20.700
do not take your medicine.
It has been poisoned.

17:20.733 --> 17:24.001
No! I promised Wendy I'd take it.

17:25.537 --> 17:29.573
Ew, is this diet?

17:32.710 --> 17:35.511
Ugh. Ew.

17:37.748 --> 17:40.115
Oh, would you die already?

17:40.150 --> 17:42.117
Fine.

17:52.660 --> 17:54.160
I'm dead.

17:56.696 --> 18:00.332
Oh, Tink. Did you drink
the medicine to save me?

18:00.366 --> 18:03.668
- Uh, yeah.
- With feeling!

18:03.702 --> 18:05.803
Oh.

18:05.837 --> 18:07.738
With feeling.

18:10.808 --> 18:13.876
Dad, you're gonna have to go shave,
get on your letterman jacket.

18:13.910 --> 18:16.278
Don't worry. Directors
always have a back-up plan.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.947
And I'd like you to meet ours.

18:21.416 --> 18:25.619
You're a boy.

18:27.388 --> 18:30.891
But why, Tink? Why?

18:30.925 --> 18:34.594
Now, you don't look so good.

18:34.628 --> 18:38.263
I think I might get well again,
if the boys...

18:38.297 --> 18:42.066
If the boys and girls
believed in fairies.

18:42.100 --> 18:46.737
Do you believe?
Say quick that you believe!

18:46.771 --> 18:49.272
Owww!

18:49.306 --> 18:53.209
Clap your hands. Don't let
Tinker Bell's light go out.

18:58.047 --> 19:01.615
This is the part where you clap for me,
and I come back to life.

19:06.587 --> 19:07.887
Mom?

19:07.921 --> 19:10.757
Sorry, sweetie.

19:13.293 --> 19:15.795
OK. It's go time.

19:15.829 --> 19:20.965
Come on, one clap? Anybody?

19:20.999 --> 19:23.501
Anything?

19:23.535 --> 19:25.536
How 'bout them Mets?

19:33.476 --> 19:36.778
Works for me. Come on,
let's go save Wendy.

19:39.448 --> 19:40.615
Freeze, Tinker Bell.

19:40.916 --> 19:43.517
You're going downtown
for bad acting, punk.

19:43.551 --> 19:48.654
- Flutter?
- Sergeant Flutter.

19:48.689 --> 19:51.924
You're coming with me,
straight to the slammer.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.594
Flutter, you have
to get out of here

19:56.795 --> 19:59.029
before people start to
think you're a real fairy.

20:05.201 --> 20:08.136
They're definitely gonna
think you're a real fairy.

20:16.279 --> 20:18.714
Ow. Ow. Ow.

20:20.883 --> 20:23.618
See that? That's how
you play a fairy.

20:27.521 --> 20:29.222
Well, this is how you
get rid of a fairy.

20:39.466 --> 20:44.302
I'm thinking maybe we should
leave before this is over.

20:44.336 --> 20:46.937
- Split a cab downtown?
- Oh, yeah. Let's go.

20:50.741 --> 20:52.508
Jerry!

20:58.713 --> 21:02.015
All right, Sergeant Flutter.

21:02.049 --> 21:05.684
You have the right to remain silent.
In this drawer.

21:05.719 --> 21:09.989
Ow.

21:12.059 --> 21:14.762
Boo!

21:22.720 --> 21:24.254
That's good, Max.

21:24.288 --> 21:25.654
Here he comes.

21:25.922 --> 21:29.423
I'm sure there are plenty of
colleges that'll take you.

21:29.457 --> 21:31.359
I can get you into my alma mater.

21:31.393 --> 21:34.061
Mom, you went to an
all-girls college.

21:34.096 --> 21:36.097
Wait. That could work.

21:36.131 --> 21:39.233
Yeah, I'll come visit.

21:39.267 --> 21:42.335
Um... I'm just trying
to help out my son.

21:44.337 --> 21:47.072
Look, Justin. We wrote a letter
of recommendation for you.

21:48.842 --> 21:50.609
"Dear Clementine College,

21:50.644 --> 21:54.112
here is a review of Justin
Russo's directing debut.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.246
In this ambitious production,
Tinker Bell swats down her own inner-demon
