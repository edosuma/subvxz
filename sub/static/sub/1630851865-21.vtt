00:38.120 --> 00:39.360
Hi, Ollie!

00:39.519 --> 00:41.120
Oh! What are you painting?

00:41.280 --> 00:43.440
-Well...
-Wait. Let me guess!

00:44.000 --> 00:45.400
-Squished broccoli?
-No.

00:45.559 --> 00:46.919
-A green monster?
-No.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.559
A blob of pea soup in a green hat?

00:49.680 --> 00:50.839
No.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.559
[sighs]
It's supposed to be a four-leaf clover.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.000
Like this one. Only with one more leaf.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.879
Oh!

00:59.839 --> 01:01.559
Nope. Still don't see it.
[sighs]

01:01.720 --> 01:03.519
Guess I'd better start over.

01:04.039 --> 01:05.519
Again.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.800
Whoa!

01:09.399 --> 01:11.119
-Uh?
-I'm OK.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.399
What's this painting for, Ollie?

01:13.520 --> 01:15.440
I'm making my Auntie Char a birthday card

01:15.560 --> 01:17.399
with a lucky four-leaf clover on it.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.360
-It's her favourite plant!
-Neat.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.160
But why is a four-leaf clover lucky?

01:22.479 --> 01:25.080
Because almost all clover
has three leaves.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.080
So you have to be really lucky
to find one with four leaves!

01:28.200 --> 01:31.240
Oh! Well, I'm pretty lucky.

01:31.360 --> 01:34.160
Maybe I could find you
a real one for your card!

01:34.320 --> 01:35.240
Be right back!

01:37.039 --> 01:39.640
A real four-leaf clover
would be amazing, Moon,

01:39.759 --> 01:42.479
but finding one in Brooklyn
is next to impossible!

01:42.800 --> 01:44.600
If it's here, I'll find it!

01:52.039 --> 01:53.440
Yeah, it's not here!

01:53.559 --> 01:55.800
And there's no more clover
to look through!

01:55.920 --> 01:57.119
Thanks for trying!

01:57.280 --> 01:58.839
But I'd better get back to my painting.

02:00.479 --> 02:03.800
-Wait. Ollie!
-You brainstormed?

02:03.960 --> 02:08.000
Yes! We just need to go
where there's lots of clover!

02:08.120 --> 02:11.120
Like Ireland! It's the land of clover!

02:11.280 --> 02:12.480
But Ireland's far away

02:12.640 --> 02:14.560
and Auntie Char's birthday is tomorrow!

02:14.720 --> 02:16.960
Then we'd better hurry! Come on!

02:17.359 --> 02:18.680
It'll be fun!

02:24.760 --> 02:25.840
Whoo!

02:26.959 --> 02:28.640
Whee!

02:35.480 --> 02:40.160
<i>Now arriving in Ireland,</i>
<i>the land of clover!</i>

02:45.720 --> 02:47.519
What did I tell you, Ollie?

02:47.640 --> 02:49.760
Just look at all this clover!

02:49.880 --> 02:52.640
Wow! It's clover all over!

02:52.799 --> 02:55.920
There's gotta be a four-leaf
clover in here somewhere,

02:56.079 --> 02:57.480
huh, Ollie?

02:57.679 --> 02:58.440
Ollie?

02:59.320 --> 03:01.760
-Whatcha doing?
-Setting up my search area.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.280
See? I'll search square by square

03:04.440 --> 03:06.359
and that way I won't miss a spot.

03:06.480 --> 03:10.640
Um... Ollie.
There's just one problem with your plan.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.320
Where's the fun?

03:12.640 --> 03:14.959
Let's play while we're looking!

03:15.079 --> 03:18.239
No, I want to be careful.
I'm going to do things my way.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.720
OK. Then I'll do things my way.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.840
And we'll see who finds
the four-leaf clover first.

03:24.000 --> 03:24.920
-OK.
-Good.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.359
-Great.
-Fine.

03:29.519 --> 03:32.359
Nothing but three-leaf clovers here.

03:32.519 --> 03:35.320
Step, jump, step, jump,

03:35.519 --> 03:38.200
swirl, and...

03:38.359 --> 03:40.880
no four-leaf clovers here. Hmm.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.640
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.760
Just three-leaf clovers here.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.720
Step, jump, step, jump,

03:48.880 --> 03:50.920
swirl and...

03:52.720 --> 03:55.560
Moon! Your fun messed up my search area!

03:55.679 --> 03:58.640
No, your search area messed up my fun!

03:58.760 --> 04:02.160
-I have to start all over!
-I can't move!

04:04.480 --> 04:05.880
[sheeps bleat]

04:06.040 --> 04:09.440
Ollie, do you get the feeling
we're being watched?

04:09.600 --> 04:13.760
[sheeps bleat]
Oh! They're so cute!

04:13.920 --> 04:16.320
Maybe, but they'll eat all the clover!

04:16.479 --> 04:18.320
Shoo! Git! Git!

04:18.800 --> 04:21.560
Hey, hey! It tickles! It tickles!

04:22.039 --> 04:25.840
Hi! I'm Seamus!
What in the green grass happened here?

04:25.960 --> 04:28.520
I'm Moon and this is my friend, Ollie.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.080
We're a little tied up.
[chuckles]

04:31.200 --> 04:34.039
I think Cutie's taken a liking to you,
Ollie.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.680
Ugh! Slobbery!

04:37.800 --> 04:41.520
Seamus, do you think you could
give us a hand with this string,

04:41.680 --> 04:43.360
-please?
-Of course!

04:44.080 --> 04:46.280
There you are, lads.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.240
-Thank you!
-Thanks!

04:48.400 --> 04:49.560
What brings you to Ireland?

04:49.719 --> 04:51.800
We're looking for a four-leaf clover.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.960
Ah! A shamrock!

04:54.120 --> 04:55.640
The luck of the Irish!

04:55.800 --> 04:59.640
Good, good! You know there's
a saying about how to find one?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.200
To find a shamrock, here's how to start.

05:02.360 --> 05:06.159
Open your eyes and open your heart!

05:09.120 --> 05:10.039
[both]
I don't get it.

05:10.159 --> 05:11.080
No matter.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.120
This isn't the place to find one anyway!

05:13.240 --> 05:15.000
-It's not?
-No.

05:15.159 --> 05:18.320
But I'm about to take the sheep
to graze at the very best place

05:18.440 --> 05:21.560
-to find a four-leaf clover!
-Did you hear that, Moon?

05:22.039 --> 05:23.919
-Fantastic!
-I know!

05:24.039 --> 05:26.560
Maybe we can help you
round the sheep up

05:26.680 --> 05:30.039
-so we can get there faster.
-Brilliant idea.

05:30.159 --> 05:33.640
Cutie and Princess over there
are always trouble.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.560
Let's go catch them, Ollie!

05:38.680 --> 05:40.960
-It'll be fun!
-Catch them?

05:41.120 --> 05:42.800
That sounds like it might be...

05:43.760 --> 05:44.960
slobbery.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.400
I think I'll just ask them
politely to come along.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.039
-It'll be safer.
-You try it your way, Ollie.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.520
I'll try it my way.

05:53.039 --> 05:55.039
And we'll see
who rounds the sheep up first.

05:58.599 --> 06:02.039
[western stand-off music]

06:11.919 --> 06:13.120
[sheep bleats]

06:13.280 --> 06:16.080
Cutie! Come back here!

06:16.240 --> 06:18.440
Cutie! Come here girl!

06:19.560 --> 06:21.000
Excuse me, Princess.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.560
Would you be so kind

06:22.719 --> 06:25.120
as to follow me
into the circle over there?

06:25.280 --> 06:26.280
[sheep bleats]

06:27.640 --> 06:30.039
See, I'm kind of in a hurry

06:30.159 --> 06:33.039
because I need to find a four-leaf clover.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.280
So, if you could come along?

06:39.680 --> 06:41.440
Cutie! Whoa!

06:41.640 --> 06:44.000
Ha! How about this?

06:44.159 --> 06:46.840
A fancy carpet fit
for a princess like you.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.120
And look! Your adoring herd
is waiting for you at the end!

06:58.799 --> 07:00.719
Woo-hoo!

07:00.880 --> 07:02.599
Whoa! Not this way, Cutie!

07:14.159 --> 07:15.960
[whistling]

07:16.440 --> 07:19.719
Seamus, do you think
you could give us a hand again?

07:19.880 --> 07:23.359
Oh! You two sure know how to get tangled.

07:26.799 --> 07:28.400
There you go, lad.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.919
Why not work together now and then?

07:31.039 --> 07:32.080
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.799
Now, let's head out to the clover

07:34.919 --> 07:37.520
before you two
get yourselves tied up again.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.359
[chuckles]
What a mess!

07:39.520 --> 07:41.880
And right when my way was about to work!

07:42.039 --> 07:46.640
What do you mean?
I was this close to herding them my way.

07:46.799 --> 07:51.520
Ahem! Pardon,
but you're both going the wrong way.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.280
-Follow me!
-Right.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.320
Let's go get that four-leaf clover!

07:58.479 --> 07:59.440
Yep.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.919
Here's the best place
to find a four-leaf clover

08:06.080 --> 08:07.760
in all of Ireland!

08:07.880 --> 08:08.840
Why's that?

08:08.960 --> 08:10.880
Because clover with white flowers

08:11.000 --> 08:13.239
produce the most four-leaf plants.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.760
Now, don't forget to open
your eyes and your heart!

08:17.919 --> 08:19.479
-Thanks, Seamus!
-Thank you!

08:19.599 --> 08:20.719
Good luck!

08:20.880 --> 08:22.080
I'll just get my string set up.

08:22.239 --> 08:25.159
And I'll get ready for some fun and...

08:25.320 --> 08:27.039
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

08:27.599 --> 08:28.799
What happened?

08:28.960 --> 08:31.880
How could we possibly be tangled up again?

08:32.039 --> 08:33.159
[sighs]

08:33.280 --> 08:36.120
All I know is whenever we try
to do things our way...

08:36.360 --> 08:38.000
We get in each other's way.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.240
Maybe we're going about this all wrong,
Ollie.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.439
We should be working together,
like Seamus said.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.680
But how?
[sheep bleats]

08:50.640 --> 08:53.319
Ollie, I'm having a brainstorm.

And Cutie's making sure we can
tell where we've looked already!

09:29.280 --> 09:31.439
This idea is a perfect mix, Moon!

09:31.560 --> 09:35.920
It's careful, like my way,
and fun, like your way!

One, two, three, four leaves!

-Seamus, look!
-Grand!

09:58.920 --> 10:01.000
-How did you find it?
-Easy!

10:01.160 --> 10:03.839
We opened our hearts to each other's ways.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.800
And then we opened our eyes,
just like you said!

Look there!

10:13.280 --> 10:15.280
Time for me to get the sheep home,

10:15.439 --> 10:17.160
but it was fun meeting you, friends.

10:17.439 --> 10:19.600
You know what we say
about friends in Ireland?

10:19.760 --> 10:22.920
"A good friend is like a four-leaf clover,

10:31.199 --> 10:33.600
Happy birthday, Auntie Char!

10:33.760 --> 10:35.760
This year,
I travelled all the way to Ireland

10:35.920 --> 10:39.079
to find a real four-leaf clover
with Moon's help!

10:39.199 --> 10:40.959
Oh! It's my favourite!

10:41.120 --> 10:44.280
And the loveliest card I've ever received!

10:44.439 --> 10:46.000
Thank you!
[laughs]

10:46.160 --> 10:50.160
But four-leaf clovers are so hard to find!

10:50.319 --> 10:52.680
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?

10:52.839 --> 10:54.760
We're already lucky enough.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.079
We're so lucky to be friends!

10:57.280 --> 10:59.319
