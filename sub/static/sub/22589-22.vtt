<i>NARRATOR".
When last we saw the Dynamic Duo...</i>

00:12.931 --> 00:15.558
<i>...Robin was in for a wax job.</i>

00:15.808 --> 00:22.815
<i>And Batman was about to be skeletonized
by the Joker's Human Key Duplicator.</i>

00:23.024 --> 00:26.569
<i>Sad to say, nothing has changed.</i>

01:43.479 --> 01:46.316
Sorry to leave you, Batman,
at this key point in your life...

01:46.524 --> 01:49.152
...but I have other more important things
to tend to...

01:49.360 --> 01:53.197
...than my humdrum locksmith activities.
Heh-heh.

01:53.448 --> 01:56.200
The actual skeletonizing process
will begin shortly.

01:56.409 --> 01:59.412
When it's over,
and the Boy Wonder is properly waxed...

01:59.621 --> 02:00.788
...let me know.

02:00.997 --> 02:02.915
Turn the spray on full.

02:12.091 --> 02:15.803
This joke of the Joker's don't strike me
as being funny. What if we get caught?

02:16.012 --> 02:17.388
We won't, Latch.

02:17.597 --> 02:21.017
Think of all we owe the Joker,
the fine things he's done for us.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.936
Sneaking those files into the prison...

02:24.145 --> 02:26.939
...dumping our parole officer
in the Gotham River...

02:27.148 --> 02:31.319
...kidnapping that entire jury
and holding the judge's wife as hostage.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.280
He's been a real friend.

02:34.572 --> 02:35.740
You're right, Bolt.

02:35.948 --> 02:38.785
There should be more fine, upstanding men
like the Joker.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.463
Look, a living Bat skeleton.

03:40.346 --> 03:43.307
I am not one given to trite sayings, Robin...

03:43.516 --> 03:47.270
...but I'd say I got you out
of that Spray Wax Chamber in the nick of time.

03:47.478 --> 03:51.649
Thanks to those underwater swimming lessons
I could've held my breath a while longer.

03:51.858 --> 03:54.694
How did you get out
of that fiendish Key Duplicator, Batman?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.572
I jammed the machinery
with a simple house key...

03:57.780 --> 04:02.201
...that I carry in my utility belt
in case we're locked out.

04:02.410 --> 04:06.622
When the cutting blade retracted,
device automatically opened.

04:06.831 --> 04:09.250
The Joker was none too sophisticated...

04:09.459 --> 04:12.879
...with his brilliant changes and innovations.

04:13.087 --> 04:17.257
A good lesson, Robin:
always carry an extra key.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.303
I'd say you were both lucky to be still alive.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.723
And stupid to have walked into that trap
in the first place.

04:23.931 --> 04:28.895
Without danger, the game grows cold.
Little is gained without risk.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.396
True, indeed, sir.

04:30.605 --> 04:32.231
Now, uh, if I may be permitted...

04:32.440 --> 04:35.693
...Mrs. Cooper has invited her
whist group to lunch.

04:35.902 --> 04:39.739
- I promised I'd serve it punctually at 1, sir.
-Of course, Alfred.

04:42.408 --> 04:45.661
Anyway, at least we know
where the Joker's hideout is, Batman.

04:45.870 --> 04:50.124
I hardly think that Mr. Clavier Ankh
and his crafty cohorts...

04:50.333 --> 04:52.543
...will be found at that address, Robin.

04:52.752 --> 04:54.504
What do we do?

04:54.712 --> 05:00.009
Like Mohammed, we must wait
until the mountain comes to us again.

05:00.218 --> 05:03.095
Still alive? How can they be?

05:03.304 --> 05:05.473
Well, Batman is, that's for sure.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.893
Oh, well, I might as well be
philosophical about it.

05:09.101 --> 05:12.104
Regardless of how clever
the Dynamic Duo are...

05:12.313 --> 05:14.023
...their hours are measured.

05:14.232 --> 05:18.444
In fact, I'm measuring them right now
with this time machine.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.574
I found a wrinkle.

05:23.783 --> 05:25.868
Ah. You're worried about wrinkles, Cornelia...

05:26.077 --> 05:28.579
...when I have just rebuilt and refined
my magic box...

05:28.788 --> 05:31.040
...so that when I turn this key...

05:31.249 --> 05:34.460
...I can turn time
either backward or forward...

05:34.836 --> 05:37.463
...or stop it completely. Ha-ha-ha!

05:37.797 --> 05:41.717
- Will your gadget work anyplace, boss?
-Anyplace and on anything or anybody.

05:41.926 --> 05:45.137
For instance,
somewhere in Gotham City right now...

05:45.346 --> 05:47.139
...the sidewalks are crowded...

05:47.348 --> 05:50.518
...and the traffic is busy.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.272
<i>Now, see what happens
when I turn this key...</i>

05:54.480 --> 05:56.816
<i>...and time moves a bit faster.</i>

05:59.068 --> 06:01.153
<i>And faster...</i>

06:02.613 --> 06:04.156
<i>...and faster...</i>

06:04.365 --> 06:06.409
<i>...and faster.</i>

06:07.243 --> 06:10.246
<i>Then if I stop time...</i>

06:12.707 --> 06:16.085
<i>...and start it again, very slowly...</i>

06:16.294 --> 06:20.464
<i>...or even move it backwards slowly.</i>

06:24.343 --> 06:28.055
<i>Let's try the Gotham Airport...</i>

06:28.764 --> 06:31.934
<i>...or the Gotham Ballpark...</i>

06:34.562 --> 06:38.691
...or <i>the handsome residence
of millionaire Bruce Wayne.</i>

06:38.900 --> 06:41.736
You know, I never go inside Bruce's study.

06:41.944 --> 06:46.991
But as long as I'm taking you girls
on a tour of the house, we'll just...

06:53.164 --> 06:57.209
<i>Or even
Commissioner Gordon's office. Heh-heh.</i>

06:59.962 --> 07:01.088
Ha, ha!

07:01.297 --> 07:04.133
- Don't stop now, boss.
-Yeah, try it on Batman and Robin.

07:04.342 --> 07:05.635
That's what I plan to do.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.846
But I want to meet them face-to-face.

07:09.055 --> 07:12.558
I want to see the results myself.
Heh-heh-heh.

07:12.767 --> 07:15.978
Did you make this one out of cheese parings
and lightning bugs too, Joker?

07:16.187 --> 07:17.855
Uh, no, Cornelia.

07:18.064 --> 07:21.525
My newest triumph is composed
of much more complicated parts:

07:21.734 --> 07:24.570
human frailties,
the power of mass suggestion...

07:24.779 --> 07:27.698
...catalytic agents, unexplained phenomena.

07:28.032 --> 07:30.368
Gee, all that in one box, boss?

07:30.576 --> 07:32.244
Plus two added components, Latch.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.456
- A pellet and a pond.
-A what and a which?

07:35.665 --> 07:39.210
Ingredients which must remain secret
for the nuns, Cornelia.

07:39.418 --> 07:42.755
But they did their work today.
Ha-ha-ha!

07:43.422 --> 07:44.590
What's next, boss?

07:44.799 --> 07:48.302
Next, Bolt,
to stop time throughout Gotham City...

07:48.511 --> 07:51.389
...unless the city fathers meet my demands.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.600
You're so forceful when you demand things
from fathers, Joker.

07:54.809 --> 07:58.104
- What is it this time?
-A mere $10 million, Cornelia.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.357
Ha-ha-ha!
But first a moment to catch my breath.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.568
While another message I sent
is being delivered about the time...

08:04.777 --> 08:07.655
...I imagine the Dynamic Duo
are getting an emergency call.

08:17.623 --> 08:18.666
Yes, commissioner.

08:18.874 --> 08:21.544
I would've phoned you sooner,
but I had nothing to report.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.213
Well, I have something to report, Batman.

08:24.422 --> 08:28.509
Our beloved metropolis
seems to be in the grip of a strange spell.

08:28.718 --> 08:32.513
Someone, and we suspect the Joker again,
is playing a devious trick with time...

08:32.722 --> 08:35.099
...turning it backward, forward,
faster, slower.

08:35.307 --> 08:38.519
Sounds like he's improved
on that magic box of his.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.063
Which could spell disaster.

08:41.272 --> 08:44.859
And there's an envelope
for you here, Batman.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.653
<i>It's shaped in the form of a key.</i>

08:47.862 --> 08:52.033
Better open it and read me the message.
Time may be of the essence.

08:53.617 --> 08:57.288
We can't afford to be wrong
about this message, Robin.

08:57.496 --> 09:00.499
That's just the way Commissioner Gordon
read it over the phone.

09:00.708 --> 09:05.129
"Thanks to the work of a single sphere,
you saw what happened to time right here."

09:05.337 --> 09:07.506
I just may be onto something.

09:07.715 --> 09:11.844
"Now, regard with care, my final O-HO."

09:12.595 --> 09:14.263
"0-HO."

09:14.472 --> 09:16.932
What does "O-HO" mean to you, Robin?

09:17.141 --> 09:19.643
Well, it's a word
composed of two O's and one H.

09:19.852 --> 09:21.562
- Mm-hmm.
-Holy hydraulics.

09:21.771 --> 09:25.107
H2O, the chemical symbol for water.

09:25.316 --> 09:28.235
I am onto something. Now, the last line.

09:28.444 --> 09:33.240
"I've a gargoyle's key...

09:33.991 --> 09:36.660
...and away I 90-90"

09:36.869 --> 09:40.790
Can you figure out those two words:
"gargoyle's key"?

09:40.998 --> 09:43.542
I know gargoyles are grotesque figures...

09:43.751 --> 09:46.003
...that decorate
some of Europe's old churches.

09:46.212 --> 09:49.090
I see. And their original functions...

09:49.298 --> 09:53.427
...their meanings, Robin, were water spouts...

09:53.636 --> 09:57.056
...drains, funnels, throughways...

09:57.264 --> 10:01.685
Then a gargoyle's key
could also be the key to a waterworks.

10:01.894 --> 10:04.688
Yes, and that all ties into the first sentence.

10:04.897 --> 10:08.567
"Thanks to the work of a single sphere."

10:08.776 --> 10:11.529
"Sphere." A ball is a sphere.

10:11.946 --> 10:13.489
A marble...

10:13.697 --> 10:16.951
...a pebble, pill.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.869
A pill.

10:19.078 --> 10:21.664
The Joker could have gotten
the key to the waterworks...

10:21.872 --> 10:23.541
...and polluted Gotham City's water.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.252
I've heard that a character
resembling the Joker...

10:26.460 --> 10:30.297
...was seen by a waterworks guard
near the storage reservoir a night or so ago.

10:30.506 --> 10:32.174
- Holy floodgate.
-Yes, Robin.

10:32.383 --> 10:35.344
He may have started his job with one pill.

10:35.553 --> 10:38.848
And now he's off to finish that job.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.267
As insidious a scheme
as could be imagined.

10:41.475 --> 10:45.020
Extortion via time.

10:45.229 --> 10:47.731
- We better get to the waterworks.
-If I may, sir?

10:49.525 --> 10:52.403
I didn't want to interrupt,
but I heard the whole thing.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.865
And I just can't let you and Master Robin
run the risk really, sir.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.159
- Let me go.
-You, Alfred?

10:58.367 --> 11:02.329
Yes. Mrs. Cooper's whist group left
and she's gone to the theater.

11:02.663 --> 11:06.667
In an hour, it will be dark, I shall have
no difficulty in getting into the waterworks.

11:06.876 --> 11:08.794
My cousin Egbert is night watchman there.

11:09.003 --> 11:10.087
Remember Eggie, sir?

11:10.296 --> 11:13.591
As president of the Water Commission,
you helped him get his job.

11:13.799 --> 11:17.761
Now, it's more than likely
that he's the man who saw the Joker and--

11:20.055 --> 11:23.684
I seldom ask a favor, sir,
but I do ask this one.

11:23.893 --> 11:27.396
You see, I'd like to feel
that I'm not only contributing my bit.

11:27.605 --> 11:30.191
I like to feel that I'm part of the team, sir.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.569
- Well spoken, Alfred.
-Of course, you're part of the team.

11:33.777 --> 11:38.240
Then you will, sir, let me replace you
in this crafty charade?

11:38.449 --> 11:41.076
Not exactly replace us, Alfred.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.454
But it might not be a bad idea...

11:43.662 --> 11:46.457
...for you to replace your cousin
in the security room.

11:46.665 --> 11:50.794
That way, Robin and I
could stake out the storage reservoir...

11:51.003 --> 11:53.964
...and be nearby and on the alert.

11:54.173 --> 11:56.258
Hoping you'd say that, sir.

11:57.885 --> 12:02.514
I, uh, brought my wheels,
for want of a better word, with me...

12:02.723 --> 12:05.267
...and with no intention
of infringement, sir...

12:05.476 --> 12:08.437
...I call it my Alf-Cycle.

12:08.646 --> 12:12.233
I have my Two-way Alf-radio
between the handlebars.

12:12.441 --> 12:16.028
And, uh, I took the liberty
of making the necessary adjustments...

12:16.237 --> 12:17.446
...on the Batmobile unit.

12:17.655 --> 12:19.531
Good thinking, Alfred.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.871
<i>Well, arrivederci.</i>

12:38.050 --> 12:40.594
- Me, Egbert?
-Yeah, you.

12:40.803 --> 12:44.640
I should've made you stay out
at the visitor's vestibule.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.475
We got a rule around here.

12:46.684 --> 12:51.063
Nobody allowed in this room
except the authorized personnel.

12:51.689 --> 12:53.023
That means me.

12:53.232 --> 12:56.443
Who knows but that some misguided soul...

12:56.652 --> 12:59.863
...might try to slip in
and pollute the city's water supply.

13:00.072 --> 13:03.575
Yeah. The other night, I caught some joker...

13:04.034 --> 13:06.662
...in the storage reservoir and threw him out.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.414
A wise move indeed.

13:08.622 --> 13:12.459
But I'm not here to upset security, Eggie,
I'm here to relieve you.

13:12.668 --> 13:15.838
Millionaire Bruce Wayne,
for whom, as you know, I butle...

13:16.046 --> 13:18.841
...and a very influential gentleman
with city government...

13:19.049 --> 13:21.051
...fears you may be overworked.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.095
He ain't just talking.

13:23.304 --> 13:26.307
He suggested that I replace you
on your shift tonight...

13:26.515 --> 13:28.183
...and, uh, give you a bit of a breather.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.935
I sure could use it.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.023
And I know just the bit.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.483
Bubbles LaBlue at The Follies.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.611
That chick swings like a king's playground.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.864
We're just about the same size, Eggie.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.699
I'm sure your uniform would fit me.

13:43.907 --> 13:48.329
Yeah, take off them specs,
and we do look a little alike.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.748
Next guard comes on duty at 4 a.m.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.416
Can't see too good.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.960
Play it straight and he'll think you's me.

13:55.169 --> 13:58.964
Don't worry, Eggie.
Any particular instructions?

13:59.173 --> 14:03.052
Ah. All the watchmen
has to do on this job is watch.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.803
Now, that ain't too hard.

14:05.012 --> 14:08.557
If you should happen to run
into Tassles Laverne at The Follies...

14:08.766 --> 14:10.351
...say hello to her from me.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.629
What am I doing here, Joker?

14:38.837 --> 14:40.714
A vent shaft in the waterworks?

14:40.923 --> 14:43.467
I wanted you here on the kill, Cornelia.

14:43.675 --> 14:47.096
This little caper is my trump card,
my coup d'état.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.640
Got something to do with
your box and key, Joker?

14:49.848 --> 14:51.892
And the bullets and the palms,
or whatever you said?

14:52.101 --> 14:56.105
Ah, pellets and pond, Cornelia.

14:56.438 --> 14:59.274
More simply, these pills...

15:01.652 --> 15:04.154
...and these waterworks.
-Those are pills?

15:05.072 --> 15:09.743
Oh, the chemist was in a whimsical mood
when he filled the prescription.

15:09.952 --> 15:13.330
But by dissolving my key-shaped capsule
in the main reservoir...

15:13.539 --> 15:17.042
...and then resorting to the powers
of my magic box and key...

15:17.251 --> 15:20.504
...I shall forever control the matter of time
in Gotham City...

15:20.712 --> 15:25.551
...and thus my odious adversaries,
the Dynamic Duo.

15:25.759 --> 15:29.430
Don't forget those fathers, Joker,
and all that mere dough.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.850
Oh. Never fear, Cornelia.

15:33.058 --> 15:36.478
If you're gonna toss pills in water,
why don't we climb over the fence?

15:36.687 --> 15:38.063
Too dangerous, Bolt.

15:38.272 --> 15:40.524
Very tight security in here.

15:40.732 --> 15:44.194
Except for that guard in there.
He can be bought.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.864
Who wants to buy an old goat like that?

15:47.072 --> 15:49.825
Oh, Cornelia, he's on the take.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.578
Fixable. Oh.

15:53.871 --> 15:56.165
This grill lifts easily.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.292
Latch, Bolt.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.712
Careful now.

16:02.254 --> 16:04.840
Quietly, quietly.

16:23.609 --> 16:26.320
Who goes there? I mean, here?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.740
Oh, good evening, friend.
You were sleeping so soundly...

16:29.948 --> 16:31.742
...I hoped not to disturb you.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.994
How did you get in here? See that notice?

16:34.453 --> 16:36.121
We got a rule around here.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.249
I know, but you were so courteous to me
the other evening...

16:39.458 --> 16:42.044
...near the storage reservoir.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.254
Courteous, sir? I threw you out.

16:44.463 --> 16:47.591
Uh, the old fellow seems a bit befuddled.

16:47.799 --> 16:51.803
Oh, this might help you recollect.

16:52.846 --> 16:56.391
Add it to the fiver I gave you last time.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.062
Eggie. Bribed.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.355
What?

17:01.563 --> 17:04.316
I got a frog kicking around my tonsils.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.402
Well, a cup of nice fresh water
should fix that.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.968
There you are.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.262
I hate to drink alone.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.721
Oh, I'll join you, Daddy-o.

17:34.930 --> 17:37.933
There are no mirrors around here.
No mirrors make me thirsty.

17:38.141 --> 17:42.187
- No, no, Cornelia.
-You heard the lady, give her a drink.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.941
And give that shifty-looking stooge one
and that greasy goon.

17:46.149 --> 17:49.027
While you're at it, have a big slug on me.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.487
- Oh--
- Ay-yi-yi.

17:50.696 --> 17:53.073
I ain't just talking, brother.

18:16.597 --> 18:19.474
Now drink.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.063
And now I'll take that box of yours.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.983
- No.
-Come on, hand it over.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.110
This iron box, real bullets?

18:30.319 --> 18:31.570
Hurry. Come on.

18:40.746 --> 18:44.082
Well, Joker, I guess this is the end of you...

18:44.291 --> 18:46.293
...and your gargoyle's KEY-

18:46.501 --> 18:49.087
Gargoyle's key?

18:49.796 --> 18:52.257
You're no security guard.

18:52.466 --> 18:55.636
You must be working
with Batman and Robin.

19:11.443 --> 19:15.739
Come on, Daddy-o,
give little old Cornelia that silly old box.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.826
Mommy.

19:21.620 --> 19:24.623
My word. A bit too much.

19:34.383 --> 19:35.759
Ah.

19:35.967 --> 19:39.262
A truly remarkable contraption.

19:39.638 --> 19:43.183
Stay right there.

19:53.485 --> 19:56.071
Batman. Batman.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.448
- Alfred here.
<i>- I</i> read you, over.

19:58.657 --> 20:01.660
The Joker and his cohorts
are, so to speak, on ice.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.871
At least I've managed
to freeze them in time...

20:05.080 --> 20:07.332
...with the help of his unique invention.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.252
<i>Good going, Alfred. We'll be right there.</i>

20:10.460 --> 20:12.129
Thank you, sir.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.271
What happened, boss?

20:29.479 --> 20:33.358
Obviously the stupid fool removed the key
from my magic box.

20:33.567 --> 20:36.903
Let's get him
before he discovers his mistake.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.197
All right, hand over that box.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.325
I said, give me that box!

20:42.534 --> 20:44.870
Just a moment, Joker.
You needn't be so vociferous.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.705
My hearing is unimpaired.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.708
Vociferous? Unimpaired? Ha!

20:49.916 --> 20:51.710
Now I know you're no security guard.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.879
Jumping to another conclusion, Joker?

20:54.087 --> 20:57.466
Get the box from the old geezer.
It's my last chance.

21:02.053 --> 21:05.474
You said you wanted me on the kill,
I didn't know you were this serious.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.583
Your little game is over, Joker.

21:31.792 --> 21:37.047
Robin, take him to the Batmobile
while I clean up the rest of this debris.

21:37.255 --> 21:39.341
Right.
If you wanna pollute any more water...

21:39.549 --> 21:42.719
...you'll find plenty where you're going,
up the river.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.458
I hate to bother you, young man...

22:13.667 --> 22:18.421
...but I was returning home from town
and I ran out of gas a little way down the road.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.716
Uh-- Alfred.

22:21.925 --> 22:26.096
- What are you doing here in that getup?
-Huh?

22:26.304 --> 22:30.016
I'm Mrs. Harriet Cooper
of stately Wayne Manor...

22:30.225 --> 22:32.769
...and you're our butler, Alfred.

22:32.978 --> 22:35.063
Sorry, baby. My name's Eggie.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.399
I'm the night security man.

22:37.607 --> 22:42.696
Well, the resemblance
is absolutely uncanny.

22:42.946 --> 22:46.908
Anyway, may I use your phone to call a cab?

22:47.117 --> 22:51.037
Phone? Oh, yes, yes. Here, here.

22:51.246 --> 22:54.040
- Come in, sugar. On the wall there.
-Thank you.

22:54.249 --> 22:58.169
If I can just find a dime now.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.797
- We brought you a midnight snack--
-Shh.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.718
Batman and Robin.

23:04.926 --> 23:07.220
Good evening, Mrs. Cooper.

23:07.429 --> 23:10.015
What a strange place to find you.

23:10.223 --> 23:13.268
Well, I was just telling this gentleman...

23:13.476 --> 23:17.188
...who looks exactly like the Wayne butler...

23:17.397 --> 23:20.483
...that I ran out of gas
about a block down the road and--

23:20.692 --> 23:25.530
We always carry an extra supply
in the Batmobile. Robin?

23:25.739 --> 23:29.618
- This way, Mrs. Cooper.
-Oh, thank you, Batman.

23:31.328 --> 23:33.705
The spitting image.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.291
Phew. That was a close shave, sir.

23:36.499 --> 23:39.085
But you handled it
with your usual finesse, Alfred.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.713
At least that mischief maker
and his mangy militia...

23:41.922 --> 23:44.591
...won't be bothering us for some time.
-Excellent, sir.

23:44.799 --> 23:46.092
But one thing concerns me.

23:46.301 --> 23:49.054
He still has some of those gargoyle keys
in his possession.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.056
No, no, he was relieved of them.

23:51.264 --> 23:55.018
And we received the lab report.
Somehow he'd concocted a drug...

23:55.226 --> 23:59.356
...which produced a mass hallucinatory effect
when dissolved in water...

23:59.564 --> 24:02.859
...and activated by some key force.

24:03.068 --> 24:05.654
- The key to the magic box? But how?
-Ah.

24:05.862 --> 24:09.407
How could it have turned time
backwards, forwards...

24:09.616 --> 24:11.451
...faster and slower?

24:11.660 --> 24:14.871
How little do we know of time, Alfred.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.666
A one-syllable word, a noun...

24:17.874 --> 24:22.504
...yesterday's laughter, tomorrow's tears...
