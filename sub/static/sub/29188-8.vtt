00:08.834 --> 00:09.922
Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:09.966 --> 00:12.186
Fuck!

00:13.274 --> 00:15.145
I-I know that it looks bad.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.060
You're going to rehab
first thing in the morning.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.409
You are cut off.

00:18.453 --> 00:19.758
I-I-I don't think
it's the best time

00:19.802 --> 00:21.021
for me right now.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.544
You don't really
have a choice here.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.894
I just sold a script
for $1.2 million.

00:24.937 --> 00:27.897
You know, I think I got
a lot of fucking choices.Come on, Jade.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.465
I think maybe
the best way to help him

00:30.508 --> 00:32.554
is to stay here.Fuck you both.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.600
KARL:
Uh, I have an appointment.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.080
SIMONE:
And would this appointment

00:37.124 --> 00:38.473
involve your new boyfriend
Hector?

00:38.516 --> 00:40.388
He may tag along, yes.

00:40.431 --> 00:43.347
I, uh, leave for Paris
two days after graduation.

00:43.391 --> 00:44.827
Care to join me?

00:44.870 --> 00:47.003
You should go.You'll be okay?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.309
I'll be delightful.

00:53.314 --> 00:54.793
You've got get over
this obsession

00:54.837 --> 00:55.881
with another woman's husband.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.144
I'm pregnant.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.451
How do you think he'll react?

01:00.495 --> 01:02.758
He will be thrilled.Come clean.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.890
Tell him you know about
the affair and the baby.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.501
What if...

01:06.544 --> 01:08.285
he doesn't choose me?

01:08.329 --> 01:11.549
Aren't you done
with all the lies?

01:11.593 --> 01:14.335
We definitely need
to have a talk.You're starting to scare me.

01:14.378 --> 01:15.684
I'm scared, too.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.207
Once I tell you,

01:17.251 --> 01:18.991
everything is going
to be different.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.471
Are you sick?

01:21.516 --> 01:22.691
I'm sick.

01:22.734 --> 01:23.822
Baby, what's wrong?

01:23.866 --> 01:25.215
I have cancer.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.609
Oh, my... oh, my God.

01:37.097 --> 01:41.101

01:41.144 --> 01:42.972

02:44.120 --> 02:46.166
I'm not sure when.

02:46.209 --> 02:49.430
I just know
one day I won't be here.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.388
I'm afraid to meet God.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.216
I'll have to account
for my sins.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.436
I have sinned a lot.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.873
I had an affair
with a married man.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.918
I slept with another guy's wife.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.486
I had sex with a married couple

03:02.530 --> 03:05.489
and pretty much everyone else
I ever met.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.883
Now I'm pregnant and unmarried.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.625
My mom has no idea
I've fallen in love.

03:10.668 --> 03:13.323
Taylor doesn't know
I gave Eli drugs.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.456
I'm not going to tell Rob.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.762
I'm gonna propose to Simone.

03:17.806 --> 03:20.025
I'll probably deny everything.

03:20.069 --> 03:23.986
When I do meet God,
I'll just beg his forgiveness.

03:24.029 --> 03:27.032
I'll thank him for sending me
the perfect woman.

03:27.076 --> 03:30.035
I'll say I did what I had to

03:30.079 --> 03:32.081
to survive.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.744
Sheila.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.746
SHEILA:
Oh, my God.

03:44.789 --> 03:48.271
I've been on pins and needles.
Did you talk to Rob last night?

03:48.315 --> 03:49.272
I did.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.883
So? I'm dying here.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.885
How did he react
when you told him

03:53.929 --> 03:55.800
you knew that he was
cheating on you?

03:55.844 --> 03:57.715
Well,

03:57.759 --> 04:01.980
the conversation went
in a surprising direction.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.116
You said what?
You said what?

04:07.159 --> 04:08.726
What? How could
you say that?

04:08.770 --> 04:10.337
How could you say
that, Beth Ann?

04:10.380 --> 04:12.904
What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

04:12.948 --> 04:15.080
I can't even believe
you just said that!

04:15.124 --> 04:17.257
Get back here
so I can give it to you!

04:20.172 --> 04:22.131
It's your mother's fault.

04:22.174 --> 04:25.308
Clearly, she forgot to teach
you some of the basics.

04:25.352 --> 04:30.008
Things like, when you grow up,
don't pretend to have cancer.

04:30.052 --> 04:33.273
Women lie to
their husbands every day.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.057
Some lie about
how much they spend.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.102
My lie's that I'm dying.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.974
Just because
you act classy

04:39.017 --> 04:41.019
doesn't mean you're
not fucking crazy.

04:41.063 --> 04:42.891
There is a method
to my madness.

04:42.934 --> 04:45.502
Rob will never leave me
while I'm sick.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.548
But what if April decides

04:47.591 --> 04:50.072
to tell him that
she's having his kid?

04:50.115 --> 04:53.031
That is where her good friend
Sheila comes in.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.033
I'm going to convince her
to leave town.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.384
Start a new life,
sever the tie for good.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.211
And then, once she's out
of the picture

04:59.255 --> 05:00.691
and I have Rob
all to myself,

05:00.735 --> 05:04.608
my cancer will be
miraculously cured.

05:04.652 --> 05:07.089
I used to find
that little grin charming.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.134
Now it just scares
the shit out of me.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.701
NURSE:
Ladies.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.747
The doctor will see you now.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.837
SHEILA:
Enzo.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.665
Aunt Sheila.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.754
Look at you in the white coat.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.452
This is my neighbor,
Beth Ann Stanton.

05:22.496 --> 05:25.107
Beth Ann, my nephew, Enzo.
The doctor.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.109
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Stanton.

05:27.152 --> 05:29.154
Likewise.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.811
So, Sheila says
you studied oncology.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.465
For a little while,

05:35.509 --> 05:37.815
and then I switched
to hematology.Oh, still,

05:37.859 --> 05:40.557
I bet you remember lots
of useful tidbits.

05:40.601 --> 05:43.038
I suppose so.
How can I help you?

05:43.081 --> 05:44.692
Well, I was wondering

05:44.735 --> 05:47.956
if there was a cancer
you could recommend.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.741
Recommend?Something rare.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.395
That no one's ever heard of.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.570
It should be serious.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.485
Oh, but occasionally curable.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.183
I'm sorry...

05:58.227 --> 06:00.447
And symptoms. She's
gonna need symptoms.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.753
Oh, some symptoms
would be lovely.

06:02.797 --> 06:05.495
Just wait a...

06:05.539 --> 06:07.410
What exactly
are we talking about here?

06:07.454 --> 06:08.846
SHEILA:
Enzo.

06:08.890 --> 06:13.460
I say this to you as your aunt
and a Sicilian:

06:13.503 --> 06:16.071
The less you know, the better.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.682
Okay.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.380
Um, rare cancers.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.472
What about...

06:25.515 --> 06:29.301
Epithelioid
hemangioendothelioma.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.129
Say that again.

06:31.173 --> 06:32.740
I'd rather not.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.090
That's the cancer you have?

06:35.133 --> 06:37.135
It affects soft tissue.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.572
I'd give you the details,

06:38.615 --> 06:40.574
but they're disgusting
and we're having fondue.

06:42.445 --> 06:46.057
God, I wish you'd let me go
to the doctor's with you.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.885
You always get
so emotional.

06:47.929 --> 06:51.106
No. I prefer to go
with Sheila.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.064
Now, I'm going to set the table.

06:53.108 --> 06:56.111
Wait. Wait.
At least tell me your prognosis.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.461
I will, but I don't want
to ruin our meal.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.463
Beth Ann!
Please, just tell me!

07:00.507 --> 07:03.510
Fine.

07:03.553 --> 07:06.904
But I need you to be strong.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.994
Can you do that for me, Robert?
Can you be my brave boy?

07:10.038 --> 07:12.127
Yeah.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.129
Well,

07:14.172 --> 07:17.306
it seems I only have
six months to live.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.656
Six months!

07:19.700 --> 07:21.702
But that doesn't mean
I can't recover.

07:21.745 --> 07:25.140
Miracles happen every day.

07:25.183 --> 07:28.839
But the doctor feels
we should prepare for the worst.

07:28.883 --> 07:31.059
It sounds like
he's giving up already.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.713
We should get a second opinion.

07:32.756 --> 07:37.239
No. I mean, what is
another doctor going to say?

07:37.282 --> 07:39.067
I don't have cancer?

07:39.110 --> 07:43.506
No, this is the situation,
and we all must accept it.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.899
Okay?

07:44.942 --> 07:46.509
Okay.

07:46.553 --> 07:50.382
Now, obviously, if I'm going
to fight this thing,

07:50.426 --> 07:53.560
I need you by my side.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.823
Constantly.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.306
I'm not going anywhere.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.525
You're my wife.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.875
I meant it when I said,

08:04.919 --> 08:06.703
"Till death do us part."

08:07.965 --> 08:10.446
Oh, my darling.

08:11.882 --> 08:15.016
I'm going to hold you to that.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.801
This is hard.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.021
I've never packed
for a three-month trip before.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.805
Oh, packing for three months
is easy.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.721
I do it every time
I go away for the weekend.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.332
These look sturdy.
Should I try them on?

08:27.376 --> 08:28.769
Knock yourself out.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.949
Hey, I know we agreed that you'd
fly to Paris a week after me,

08:34.992 --> 08:36.777
but wouldn't three days
be enough?

08:36.820 --> 08:38.692
Or even two?

08:38.735 --> 08:40.868
You can't wait one week?

08:40.911 --> 08:43.697
We need as much time
for sex as possible.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.655
Remember, you said you'd
make love to me in

08:45.699 --> 08:47.178
every city in Europe.
What am I supposed

08:47.222 --> 08:49.006
to do on my own
for a whole week?

08:49.050 --> 08:50.442
Beat it.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.879
That's cold.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.142
Oh, not you.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.144
What do you think?
Do you like them?

08:56.187 --> 08:57.972
Oh, what are all
the pockets for?

08:58.015 --> 08:59.147
Carrying stuff.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.149
They'll be great
for hiking over the Alps.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.020
Hiking over the Alps?Yeah.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.980
Good Lord, are we taking a
vacation or fleeing the Nazis?

09:11.855 --> 09:15.076
I'm starting to think that we're
imagining very different trips.

09:15.119 --> 09:17.861
Well, I want our vacation
to be elegant, romantic.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.863
Nights at
la Comédie-Française,

09:19.907 --> 09:21.299
dinner at Maxim's.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.127
Yeah, well, I can't
afford those things.

09:23.171 --> 09:24.955
Oh, well,
if that's the problem...

09:24.999 --> 09:26.696
No, I know you can
afford those things,

09:26.740 --> 09:29.612
but I-I don't want to
feel like your gigolo.

09:29.656 --> 09:32.049
I have an idea.
What?

09:32.093 --> 09:35.183
Return my brooch
and get your money back.

09:35.226 --> 09:38.490
What you spent on it can buy
a whole lot of escargot.

09:38.534 --> 09:41.319
I bought you this to show you
what you mean to me.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.321
Well, find another way
to show me.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.627
Like what?

09:44.671 --> 09:45.802
You're an artist.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.674
Use your imagination.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.857
Okay.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.337
I'll see what I can
come up with.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.389
Taylor.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.608
What are you doing here?

10:09.783 --> 10:11.523
Can we talk for a sec?

10:16.659 --> 10:21.577
My mom got sick when I was ten.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.755
From that point on, it was
just us, so I had to step up.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.802
But it was good, because
I learned to take charge.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.804
I found out I could
figure out the solution

10:30.847 --> 10:32.719
to any problem
that came my way.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.112
Until last night.

10:37.201 --> 10:40.814
I sat in that hotel room
until dawn

10:40.857 --> 10:44.731
trying to figure out
how to fix this thing with Eli.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.865
And I just can't.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.085
I'm so sorry.

10:51.128 --> 10:53.565
You know, when Eli
O.D.'d last time,

10:53.609 --> 10:55.393
I knew exactly what to do.

10:55.437 --> 10:58.875
I got him into rehab,
I paid off his debts.

11:00.616 --> 11:03.532
But I think that a part of him
always resented me

11:03.575 --> 11:06.230
for managing the situation
in a way that he couldn't.

11:06.274 --> 11:09.407
And now he's just
so angry at me.

11:09.451 --> 11:13.411
And I don't think
he'll let me help him.

11:13.455 --> 11:16.458
And I'm so scared of what
will happen if I can't.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.721
Eli is not going to die.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.463
He will
if he doesn't stop using.

11:23.508 --> 11:26.860
But the good news is
he still listens to you.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.166
So I am begging you. Please.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.690
You are my last hope.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.039
Of course, yes. Totally.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.345
I'm totally with you.
I promise.

11:34.389 --> 11:37.697
Thank God. You have no idea
how much that means to me.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.788
Okay.

11:41.831 --> 11:45.617
We have to move fast, before the
money comes in for Eli's script.

11:45.661 --> 11:48.011
You're worried he's gonna
spend it all on drugs?

11:48.055 --> 11:49.839
Not just drugs.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.189
When Eli's using,
he gets stupid generous.

11:52.233 --> 11:55.236
Stupid generous?Oh, yeah.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.064
The last time,
he bought gifts for everyone.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.370
Rolex watches, designer shoes.

11:59.414 --> 12:02.373
When he's high, he just wants
everyone to be as happy

12:02.417 --> 12:04.549
as he is.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.290
So, I've been thinking of ways

12:06.334 --> 12:09.990
that we can handle this
covertly.

12:10.033 --> 12:14.037
And I have one idea, but it...
it's kind of crazy.

12:14.081 --> 12:16.300
I like crazy.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.520
The next time
Eli's in the shower,

12:18.563 --> 12:22.698
I need you to go into his phone
and find all of his passwords.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.048
What?

12:25.092 --> 12:26.963
The code to his phone
is 0-4-2-9.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.965
Just here, look,
I wrote it down for you.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.967
If we can get access

12:31.011 --> 12:32.926
to his his business accounts
and his credit cards,

12:32.969 --> 12:34.449
we can cut off
his cash flow.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.667
Oh.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.060
And I'm gonna call his dad.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.975
How will that help?

12:39.019 --> 12:40.629
Eli is terrified of his dad.

12:40.672 --> 12:43.632
Jake will force him to admit
who got him using again.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.810
Why does that matter?

12:47.854 --> 12:49.594
He was clean
for two years,

12:49.638 --> 12:50.813
and then suddenly he's not?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.423
No, I need to know
what happened.

12:53.468 --> 12:54.861
Of course.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.080
And I want to help,
but is this really

12:57.124 --> 12:59.822
the best plan?What do you mean?

12:59.866 --> 13:01.389
Look, you remember how you felt
when you thought

13:01.432 --> 13:02.956
that Eli and I were
ganging up on you.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.827
How is he gonna feel
if it... if it seems

13:04.871 --> 13:06.307
like we're ganging up on him?

13:06.350 --> 13:07.830
So what do you propose we do?

13:07.874 --> 13:10.572
Give me a few days
and I'll reason with him.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.574
You really think
you can talk him into this?

13:12.617 --> 13:15.272
Trust me.
I'll get through to him,

13:15.316 --> 13:17.318
he'll come home,

13:17.361 --> 13:19.494
and we'll all be a family again.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.934
Look who's here!

13:24.978 --> 13:28.068
Karl, it's the Sitwells!You're back from
Scotland, I see.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.374
And we're meeting Rex
and Julie for dinner.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.767
They should be
here any second.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.595
Oh, I love her.
She thinks I'm pretty.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.640
We all think you're pretty.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.686
But she says it out loud.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.254
Tell you what--
when they get here,

13:40.297 --> 13:41.821
why don't you bring them over
to our table?

13:41.864 --> 13:43.126
We'll dine together.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.085
Wonderful. Then you can
tell us about your plans

13:45.128 --> 13:47.043
for Amy's
lavish wedding.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.350
We're so excited.
We can't wait.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.004
Mm.I can't wait, either.

13:52.309 --> 13:53.615
For it to be over.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.486
Yes, I was thinking
the same thing.

13:55.530 --> 13:56.966
Oof, are we terrible people?

13:57.010 --> 13:58.881
No. Weddings
are exhausting.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.710
Besides, we need to conserve
our energy for our male lovers.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.755
At least yours isn't younger
than the groom.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.496
Yeah, I think the, uh,
stepfather of the bride

14:05.540 --> 14:06.541
should have at least

14:06.584 --> 14:08.151
an age-appropriate boyfriend.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.979
Call me old fashioned,
but I just do.

14:10.023 --> 14:13.069
Oh, Karl.
What's that on your face?

14:13.113 --> 14:14.331
What?

14:14.375 --> 14:16.377
Oh, my God, are you
wearing makeup?

14:16.420 --> 14:17.813
Less than you.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.684
You really are
spreading your wings.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.773
I think I'm leaving
the country in the nick of time.

14:21.817 --> 14:25.560
I'm off to
the ladies' roomI'll order you a gimlet.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.747
Simone?

14:38.790 --> 14:39.922
Hi.

14:42.838 --> 14:45.188
Uh, you are Dr. Bennett's
wife, right?

14:45.232 --> 14:48.452
Maureen. I also work
in his practice as a nurse.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.280
Well, isn't that nice?

14:50.324 --> 14:53.066
I don't know
quite how to say this.

14:53.109 --> 14:56.504
But... do you know
your husband's a homosexual?

14:58.549 --> 15:01.552
Yes, I know.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.685
And you said it just fine.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.730
I realize it's none
of my business.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.384
I'm just trying to
be a good person.

15:07.428 --> 15:11.258
And like all good people, you
just couldn't wait to tell me.

15:11.301 --> 15:15.175
I'm going now.
Feel free to adjust your halo.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.394
Has Karl told you
he's sick?

15:17.438 --> 15:19.962
What?

15:20.006 --> 15:21.485
I can see he hasn't.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.012
Karl isn't sick.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.623
He saw my husband
three days ago.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.754
He has that new disease

15:29.798 --> 15:31.104
that all the gay men
are spreading.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.975
That's a lie.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.977
He's the third man
my husband's seen who's had it.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.980
The first two
are dead.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.722
I'm so sorry.
I just thought you should know.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.167
KARL:
I know, I know, I know,

15:51.211 --> 15:52.995
I know, I know
it sounds unbelievable

15:53.039 --> 15:55.867
and faintly ridiculous,
but bear with me on this...

15:55.911 --> 15:59.393
Oh, hello, darling.
It's perfect timing.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.699
I was just telling everyone
the story of our trip to Venice,

16:01.743 --> 16:04.876
when you accidentally knocked
that gondolier into the water.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.183
HANK:
Now, did that
really happen?

16:07.227 --> 16:09.185
Or is Karl just
embellishing?

16:10.926 --> 16:14.974
No, that-that's not the kind
of thing Karl would lie about.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.715
So, there he was,
dripping wet,

16:17.759 --> 16:20.936
hacking up great lungfuls
of the Grand Canal,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.068
and I realized
it's very difficult

16:22.111 --> 16:23.460
to maintain
one's dignity...

16:36.169 --> 16:38.040
Hey.

16:38.084 --> 16:41.043
Hey. Where have you been
all morning?Ah... out.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.523
Doing stuff.
Doing great stuff, in fact.

16:42.566 --> 16:43.828
Come with me outside.
I've got something to show you.

16:43.872 --> 16:46.179
Come on.You never came to bed
last night.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.789
Did you get
any sleep at all?

16:47.832 --> 16:49.356
No. No, it turns out
one of the side effects

16:49.399 --> 16:52.489
of near-constant cocaine use
is a wee bit of insomnia.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.751
Come on.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.495
Oh! Wow!Right?

16:58.539 --> 16:59.670
You like it?

16:59.714 --> 17:02.978
It-- uh... you bought this?I did.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.937
Well, uh, technically
American Express bought it.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.330
But that bill's gonna get paid

17:07.374 --> 17:08.940
the second my first script
payment comes through.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.159
You like it?

17:10.203 --> 17:12.640
Look, I know you've been
working really hard,

17:12.683 --> 17:14.685
and I get that you'd want
to treat yourself...

17:14.729 --> 17:15.991
Me? No. Whoa.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.037
No, I didn't--
This isn't for me.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.605
Y-You bought me a car?

17:21.649 --> 17:23.346
I did.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.306
Shut. Up.I won't.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.395
This is me saying thank you.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.397
For what?My God, for
everything.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.226
For all the help
you gave me with the script.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.271
For standing by me when Taylor
lost her mind...

17:35.315 --> 17:39.101
Oh, God... Taylor's
not gonna like this.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.321
Well, you know what?
Taylor doesn't get a vote, okay?

17:43.366 --> 17:45.760
It looks expensive.
Are you sure?

17:45.803 --> 17:47.718
Well, I made you
a promise, right?

17:47.762 --> 17:49.981
I said when this money
came through,

17:50.025 --> 17:53.159
I would take care of you.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.597
People have made me
a lot of promises in my life.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.906
Nobody's ever kept one before.

18:01.950 --> 18:04.170
Well, this is me keeping mine.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.824
And this is
just the beginning.

18:06.868 --> 18:10.915
So... do you like it?

18:14.528 --> 18:15.572
It's perfect.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.502
Just keep
going straight.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.461
So I've been doing
some research,

18:34.504 --> 18:36.115
finding jobs a
pregnant woman can do.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.768
I already have a job.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.075
You shouldn't be on your feet
all day when you're expecting,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.382
but don't worry.
There are plenty of ways

18:42.425 --> 18:44.427
a girl in your condition
can make a living.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.820
Are there?

18:45.863 --> 18:47.865
Sure. You could be

18:47.909 --> 18:49.432
a pin setter in
a bowling alley.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.521
All you'd have to do
is punch buttons.

18:51.565 --> 18:55.525
I found an opening
at an alley in Anaheim.Now take a left.

18:57.092 --> 19:00.530
BETH ANN:
Or... there's a place hiring
switchboard operators.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.228
For that, you'd have
to move to Barstow.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.838
It sounds like you're
trying to get rid of me.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.970
Don't be silly.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.105
I just thought it might
be easier for you

19:10.149 --> 19:12.412
to make a fresh start
in a new city.

19:12.455 --> 19:15.066
Well, I'm not moving.Okay.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.112
Just know I'm here for you.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.158
For anything you need.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.291
Thank you.

19:22.335 --> 19:25.773
Oh... uh, pull over,
this is it.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.961
This must be
a mistake.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.832
A doctor wouldn't have
his office in here.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.791
No, this is it.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.489
Are you sure you have
the address right?

19:46.533 --> 19:49.057
Sheila, I lied. I'm not
here to see a doctor.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.849
I don't understand.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.417
I'm sorry. I just
can't have this baby.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.593
What are you
talking about?

20:03.637 --> 20:06.466
Please do not make me
say this out loud.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.947
What you're going
to do, it's illegal.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.080
I know.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.360
God, how did you even
hear about this place?

20:31.404 --> 20:33.188
A girl at the
diner referred me.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.146
You...

20:35.190 --> 20:36.278
Excuse me.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.062
You can't do this,
it's not right.

20:38.106 --> 20:41.152
Sheila, please do not make this
harder than it already is.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.860
I'm Sally Jones.
We spoke on the phone.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.558
Who's she?

20:55.602 --> 20:56.646
My friend.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.345
She'll drive me home afterwards.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.608
You got the money?I do.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.305
Come on in.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.657
Sheila. Please.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.183
I really need a friend
right now, more than ever.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.584
Here you go, son.Thank you, sir.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.020
I'll have your car here
in just a second.

21:23.064 --> 21:26.328
Terrific night.Lovely seeing you all.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.287
Let's do it again
very soon.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.376
Good night, Simone.
See you at the wedding.

21:34.336 --> 21:37.426
All right, we're alone.
You can tell me now.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.036
Tell you what?

21:39.080 --> 21:41.343
How I've upset you.
And don't say you're fine.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.998
You've barely said two words
to me the entire evening.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.043
Wait till
we're in the car.

21:46.087 --> 21:49.351
Can I at least have
a headline?

21:49.395 --> 21:52.398
I ran into your doctor's wife
in the ladies' room.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.400
Don't think I've ever met her.

21:54.443 --> 21:57.403
She also works as a nurse.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.795
In his office.

22:04.584 --> 22:05.715
What did she say?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.588
You're sick.

22:10.546 --> 22:14.594
Well, two things:
first of all...

22:14.637 --> 22:16.073
I'm not sick.

22:17.118 --> 22:19.250
Secondly, what a gossipy bitch.

22:19.294 --> 22:22.253
Are you saying she lied?I'm not...
symptomatic.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.647
I feel fine.So what's the
makeup hiding?

22:24.691 --> 22:25.822
A spot.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.694
Don't you mean a lesion?Oh, come on,

22:27.737 --> 22:29.043
it's miniscule.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.915
Do you have any idea
how scared I am?

22:31.959 --> 22:34.004
You don't have it.What?

22:34.048 --> 22:36.485
Look, the fact is, it can only
be transmitted through blood

22:36.529 --> 22:38.400
or bodily fluids,
and we rarely had sex,

22:38.444 --> 22:39.967
and never without a condom.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.664
Is that what you think?

22:43.449 --> 22:45.494
That I'm scared for myself?Darling, darling, darling,

22:45.538 --> 22:49.150
I, I, I...
I should have told you,

22:49.193 --> 22:51.848
my love, I just...

22:51.892 --> 22:54.416
I did-- I just didn't want
to spoil your trip.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.592
Oh, God, the trip.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.464
Look, I'm so sorry.
I-I-I-I promise

22:58.507 --> 23:02.119
I-- I-I will call once
a week while you're away,

23:02.163 --> 23:04.426
with, with full
medical updates.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.428
You think I'm still going?

23:06.472 --> 23:08.691
That I'd leave you
at a time like this?

23:08.735 --> 23:11.128
And what would staying achieve?

23:11.172 --> 23:12.913
Other than letting me know

23:12.956 --> 23:14.871
that you think I won't make it
past Labor Day?

23:19.485 --> 23:21.225
You need care, Karl.

23:21.269 --> 23:26.056
Specialists. And at least
one doctor whose wife

23:26.100 --> 23:29.233
is not the goddamn town crier!

23:29.277 --> 23:31.627
I know how much
Tommy means to you.

23:31.671 --> 23:34.282
I'm staying with you,
and that is the end

23:34.325 --> 23:36.806
of this discussion.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.638
Thank you.

23:53.214 --> 23:55.738
Do you want
some whiskey?Whiskey?

23:55.782 --> 23:58.611
It's good to get a little
drunk before you start.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.090
Helps with the pain.

24:00.134 --> 24:03.006
No, thank you.Suit yourself.

24:03.050 --> 24:04.573
Just give me a couple
of minutes.

24:04.617 --> 24:08.229
I got to get some plastic
over the table.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.492
She's doing this
in the kitchen?

24:10.536 --> 24:13.582
Apparently.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.671
But it's an
invasive procedure.

24:15.715 --> 24:19.545
It requires a clean environment.
Sterilized instruments.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.285
Well, this is all
I can afford.

24:21.329 --> 24:24.811
I'm out of options, Sheila.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.813
Please understand.

24:34.690 --> 24:35.865
There's something
you don't know.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.388
There's something
I need to tell you.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.479
What's that?

24:42.568 --> 24:45.875
I had a child once,

24:45.919 --> 24:47.921
but she died.

24:49.749 --> 24:53.448
I left the gate
to the backyard open.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.450
She wandered out
into the street

24:55.494 --> 24:58.888
and she was hit
by a car.

25:01.108 --> 25:04.807
It's been years, but I think
about her every day.

25:04.851 --> 25:08.855
Sometimes,
late at night,

25:08.898 --> 25:12.336
I wonder what kind
of young woman

25:12.380 --> 25:14.861
she'd have
turned into.

25:14.904 --> 25:19.735
How could you tell me
something like that right now?

25:19.779 --> 25:22.521
Are you... are you trying
to make me feel guilty?

25:22.564 --> 25:24.610
No, you don't understand.No, I think you don't
understand, Sheila.

25:24.653 --> 25:27.743
I have to do this.Honey, I'm trying to say...

25:27.787 --> 25:32.705
I think my daughter would have
grown up to be a lot like you.

25:32.748 --> 25:35.751
That is one of the reasons
I love you.

25:35.795 --> 25:38.928
But right now
I'm afraid for you

25:38.972 --> 25:41.322
because women die
in places like this.

25:41.365 --> 25:42.584
I can't
let that happen.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.891
Sheila, I'm single
and I'm broke.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.980
I can't raise a baby.

25:47.023 --> 25:50.418
We'll figure it out.
We just need time to think.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.638
Let me help you.
How?

25:52.681 --> 25:56.032
Well, I'll...

25:56.076 --> 25:59.601
I'll get some... I'll get
my hands on some money.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.604
We can go somewhere else,
somewhere safe, but please,

26:02.648 --> 26:04.650
let's get out of here.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.480
Okay. Okay.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.797
Hello?

26:21.841 --> 26:24.670
Yeah, this is she.

26:24.713 --> 26:27.890
No, I haven't lost my Amex. Why?

26:27.934 --> 26:29.762
Suspicious activity?

26:29.805 --> 26:32.678
Um, how much was spent?

26:42.165 --> 26:44.167
TAYLOR:
Nice car.

26:44.211 --> 26:45.473
Taylor.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.649
Were you in the house?I came to talk to Eli

26:47.693 --> 26:50.347
so he could explain to me
why my credit card is maxed out,

26:50.391 --> 26:53.524
and then I saw you pull up
in this brand-new car.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.178
Well, I-I don't know
when he'll be home.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.658
He has a meeting
at Paramount and...

26:56.702 --> 26:59.487
He bought it for you, didn't he?

26:59.530 --> 27:02.403
I told him
it was too much.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.057
When?The moment he gave it to me.

27:04.100 --> 27:07.408
No. I'm asking
when did he give it to you?

27:07.451 --> 27:11.455
Before I saw you in the park
this morning or after?

27:12.718 --> 27:14.676
After.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.809
So why didn't you insist
he take it back?

27:16.852 --> 27:19.768
I was so surprised,
I didn't know what to say.

27:19.812 --> 27:22.684
Surprised? Jade, I had just
told you that when Eli is high,

27:22.728 --> 27:25.731
he's stupid with money.Well, I don't think
it's stupid.

27:25.774 --> 27:29.038
I spend every day
cooking and cleaning,

27:29.082 --> 27:33.260
running errands
and looking after you both.

27:33.303 --> 27:34.827
I think it's nice
that someone actually

27:34.870 --> 27:36.480
wanted to say
thank you.

27:36.524 --> 27:39.701
You want a thank you?
Okay, fine, Jade.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.094
Thank you.

27:41.137 --> 27:42.661
Now give me
the keys.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.576
Why?'Cause I'm gonna return
the car, obviously.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.926
No.

27:46.969 --> 27:49.058
What do you mean no?You can't return the car.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.452
It's not yours.
Eli bought it for me.

27:51.495 --> 27:52.801
Yeah, but he's coked
out of his mind.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.542
To accept a gift from a man
in that condition

27:54.585 --> 27:55.717
is not a good look.

27:55.761 --> 27:59.286
My God. Why are you
acting like this?

27:59.329 --> 28:01.201
I haven't done
anything wrong.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.769
You are taking advantage
of this situation.

28:03.812 --> 28:05.640
You're using Eli.
Just give me the keys.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.773
Stop it.
If anyone is a user,

28:07.816 --> 28:10.993
Taylor, it's you. You have been
using me for months.

28:11.037 --> 28:14.170
I saved you.
I brought you into my home.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.172
You did that for yourself,
not for me.

28:16.216 --> 28:19.262
Your marriage was falling apart
and you needed a distraction.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.525
Eli wasn't writing
or making money,

28:21.569 --> 28:22.744
and you were
so angry

28:22.788 --> 28:24.311
you could barely
even look at him.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.748
By the way, I'm the one
who got him writing again.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.142
I did that for you.

28:29.185 --> 28:30.839
You're welcome.

28:32.885 --> 28:36.105
I keep wondering why
Eli started using again.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.720
Are you the reason?

28:44.374 --> 28:48.074
Oh, my God.
We shouldn't be doing this.

28:48.117 --> 28:51.120
Fighting and throwing blame
at each other.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.774
We're supposed
to be a family.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.776
Stop it. Stop it, Jade!

28:54.820 --> 28:56.473
Eli and I
are a family.

28:56.517 --> 29:00.042
You are a houseguest.

29:00.086 --> 29:03.263
That's all.

29:06.657 --> 29:09.225
You know what, Jade?
Go upstairs,

29:09.269 --> 29:13.752
get your stuff.
I want you out of my house now!

29:16.842 --> 29:19.018
That's not gonna happen.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.585
You can leave again
if you want,

29:21.629 --> 29:24.806
but I'm not going anywhere,

29:24.850 --> 29:27.243
and I'm keeping the car.

29:27.287 --> 29:30.551
I'm not gonna let you
take it away from me.

30:01.364 --> 30:02.757
Tommy, come in.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.412
Hi. I have great news.

30:05.455 --> 30:08.241
I returned your brooch
and I got your replacement gift.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.069
Well, it's not
a traditional gift

30:10.112 --> 30:12.854
so much as a tribute to you.

30:12.898 --> 30:15.291
I sure hope you like it
because, uh,

30:15.335 --> 30:17.163
I can't really return it.

30:18.729 --> 30:21.297
Hey. You look sad. What's wrong?

30:21.341 --> 30:23.647
We need to talk.

30:27.390 --> 30:28.957
Hey. Hey, great news.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.177
Paramount wants to talk to me
about adapting a novel.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.092
I got a meeting on Friday.
I'm telling you,

30:33.135 --> 30:35.181
this comeback shit
is really starting to get real.

30:35.224 --> 30:38.445
I'm really,
really happy for you.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.360
What's wrong?

30:40.403 --> 30:42.449
Taylor stopped by.

30:42.492 --> 30:45.669
I'm guessing that
didn't go so well, huh?

30:45.713 --> 30:47.280
Oh, Eli.

30:47.323 --> 30:48.977
I hate this.

30:49.021 --> 30:52.372
I hate that she's putting me
in this position.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.678
What position?
What are you talking about?

30:54.722 --> 30:57.116
She wants me to get
the passwords to your accounts,

30:57.159 --> 30:59.074
so she can take away
all your money.

31:06.821 --> 31:09.041
Cancel the trip?

31:09.084 --> 31:10.694
I can't leave
when Karl is sick.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.348
Yeah, but-but he's not
even in the hospital.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.307
Not yet, but this disease
is unpredictable.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.569
I need to be here.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.527
No, that's not fair.
This was supposed to be

31:17.571 --> 31:19.094
the best summer of my life.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.314
And this could be
the last summer of Karl's life,

31:21.357 --> 31:23.272
so please stop sulking.

31:26.014 --> 31:28.147
What are you doing?I need a drink.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.365
You're barely 18.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.541
Yeah, well, dating
you has aged me.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.543
Give me that.

31:38.244 --> 31:41.073
One week, that's all I ask.

31:41.116 --> 31:43.858
Nothing can happen
in-in a-a week.

31:43.902 --> 31:48.254
What would be the point?
I wouldn't enjoy myself.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.125
In Paris? With me?

31:50.169 --> 31:53.955
My husband is dying.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.175
Can you not understand
what that means?

31:56.218 --> 32:00.005
So what's gonna happen to us?

32:01.484 --> 32:04.270
I don't think
there can be an "us."

32:07.229 --> 32:09.797
Look...

32:09.840 --> 32:13.105
I know that I can act
like a kid sometimes,

32:13.148 --> 32:15.977
but if you give me another
chance, I can be more mature.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.761
No.

32:17.805 --> 32:21.374
You stay young.

32:21.417 --> 32:24.681
I'm the one
who needs to grow up.

32:26.553 --> 32:27.728
That might be
Karl's doctor.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.164
I, I'm gonna take it
in the other room.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.471
Simone...No.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.803
Tommy.

33:20.868 --> 33:22.565
All right, great,

33:22.609 --> 33:25.220
and you can transfer
those funds today, right?

33:25.264 --> 33:28.049
All right, thank you.
Yeah, I'll talk to you.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.051
Bye.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.662
All right. All right,
so my business manager's on it.

33:32.706 --> 33:35.622
He's gonna reset the passwords
to all my accounts.

33:35.665 --> 33:38.625
And I spoke to Lamar. I forbid
him to speak to Taylor,

33:38.668 --> 33:41.280
so she can't use him to try
to get to my script payments.

33:41.323 --> 33:43.412
That's a relief.

33:43.456 --> 33:45.414
Do you think
it'll be enough?

33:45.458 --> 33:47.590
What do you mean?

33:47.634 --> 33:50.071
Taylor was here, in the house,
while we were out.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.942
Maybe we should think
about changing the locks.

33:51.986 --> 33:55.816
Whoa. Uh, I mean,
she's my wife and she loves me.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.818
In her way she's just
trying to protect me.

33:57.861 --> 33:59.646
She's trying
to control you.

33:59.689 --> 34:03.563
There's a difference.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.347
I don't know.

34:05.391 --> 34:08.307
I mean, maybe I should
just call her.

34:08.350 --> 34:09.482
No!

34:09.525 --> 34:11.136
I mean,
I know you want

34:11.179 --> 34:13.094
to believe that
she's gonna come around,

34:13.138 --> 34:16.315
but you have to know, deep down,
there's no way she's ever

34:16.358 --> 34:18.839
gonna get on board
with the idea of you using.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.234
And she's threatening
to call your dad.

34:22.277 --> 34:24.149
My dad?
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:24.192 --> 34:26.368
Why?

34:26.412 --> 34:29.067
She knows that I don't speak
to him. Goddamn it.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.416
She can't just fucking do that.

34:30.459 --> 34:34.028
She's trying to make
you feel small.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.074
I hate that she's
treating you this way.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.337
The last thing I want is
to see you lose everything

34:38.380 --> 34:41.253
you've been working
so hard to get.

34:41.296 --> 34:43.429
Who are you calling?

34:43.472 --> 34:45.083
Our handyman. You're right.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.128
We're gonna change
those fucking locks.

34:50.044 --> 34:53.178
Rob's got an awful lot
of old sports equipment.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.136
BETH ANN:
And he never uses any of it.

34:55.180 --> 34:58.487
So I'm taking it
to the pawnshop

34:58.531 --> 35:00.663
and giving the cash to April.

35:00.707 --> 35:03.362
Well, that'll be
a nice chunk of change.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.668
It will be easier for her
to make a rational decision

35:05.712 --> 35:08.889
about the baby if she's
not so worried about money.

35:08.932 --> 35:12.066
I still can't believe
you talked her out of it.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.938
That horrible place?
I couldn't let her stay.

35:14.982 --> 35:16.592
Here, put this
in the big pile, please.

35:16.636 --> 35:21.075
I got to admit
I'm a bit surprised.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.685
Surprised?

35:22.729 --> 35:24.557
She's pregnant
with your husband's kid.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.993
Most wives in that situation

35:26.036 --> 35:28.213
wouldn't care how rusty
the knives were.

35:28.256 --> 35:30.519
Couldn't let anything happen
to April or her baby.

35:30.563 --> 35:33.522
Honey, y-you know that she could
still decide to get rid of it.

35:33.566 --> 35:35.524
I know. That's why
I have to work hard

35:35.568 --> 35:37.396
over the next few days
to change her mind.

35:37.439 --> 35:40.355
Well, talk to her
about adoption.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.401
You know, there's-there's plenty
of nice people out there

35:42.444 --> 35:43.706
who can't have kids.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.319
I'll mention that.

35:47.362 --> 35:49.321
There's also
another possibility.

35:49.364 --> 35:50.844
What's that?

35:50.887 --> 35:53.107
Rob and I could raise the baby.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.719
What?

35:56.763 --> 35:58.547
I've got it all figured out.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.897
I'll support April
until the baby arrives,

36:00.941 --> 36:02.464
then I'll offer to raise it.

36:02.508 --> 36:05.467
As far as Rob's concerned,
I could arrange some scenario,

36:05.511 --> 36:08.427
finding it in a bassinet
in a park, abandoned.

36:08.470 --> 36:10.429
No one would ever have
to know the truth.

36:10.472 --> 36:13.127
Rob would have his child,
April could have her career,

36:13.171 --> 36:15.173
everyone would be happy.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.655
What's wrong?

36:21.091 --> 36:23.224
At first I thought it was funny,

36:23.268 --> 36:26.096
you becoming friends
with your husband's slut.

36:26.140 --> 36:27.794
Sheila, that word.And then, when
you kept getting

36:27.837 --> 36:31.145
closer to her, I thought
you were a little nutty.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.975
But no. You're sick.

36:35.018 --> 36:36.368
I'm not sick.

36:36.411 --> 36:39.240
Your kid is dead.

36:39.284 --> 36:42.504
And you're trying to replace her
with April's baby.

36:42.548 --> 36:43.897
That is not what I'm doing.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.464
That is what you're doing
from where I'm standing.

36:45.507 --> 36:47.248
You're not allowed to judge me.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.250
Not until
you pick out

36:49.294 --> 36:53.080
Benny's casket
and dress him in his Sunday best

36:53.123 --> 36:55.082
and put him in the ground.

36:55.125 --> 36:58.259
Until you do that, I don't
want to hear another word

36:58.303 --> 37:01.175
from you.

37:16.973 --> 37:18.714
SIMONE :
Hello?

37:18.758 --> 37:21.064
Simone, thank God you answered.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.284
Naomi. What's going on?

37:23.328 --> 37:24.720
I ran out without my purse,

37:24.764 --> 37:26.809
and I don't have
my insurance card or my ID,

37:26.853 --> 37:27.941
and the housekeeper
isn't answering,

37:27.984 --> 37:29.377
and I don't have
anyone else to call.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.292
Slow down. What's going on?
Where are you?

37:31.336 --> 37:32.728
I'm at the hospital.

37:32.772 --> 37:35.078
I need my purse.
Can you please bring it?

37:35.122 --> 37:36.950
Well, of course.
What's happened?

37:36.993 --> 37:38.821
Tommy's been in a car accident.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.911
I-I'll be right there.

37:53.183 --> 37:54.533
Yes. Can I help you?

37:54.576 --> 37:56.404
I'm here to speak
to Rob Stanton.

37:56.448 --> 37:58.363
Do you have an appointment?No.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.495
But I'm not leaving
until I speak to him.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.062
I beg your pardon?

38:02.105 --> 38:04.456
Tell him it's April.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.806
Oh.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.373
So you know who I am.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.375
I do.

38:10.418 --> 38:13.334
I'm sorry, but he won't see you.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.205
I really think
that you should go.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.214
Miss!

38:24.258 --> 38:25.781
Please stop.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.480
I'm sorry, Mr. Stanton.

38:28.523 --> 38:30.046
I told her you were busy.

38:30.090 --> 38:33.267
It's all right.
What do you want?

38:33.311 --> 38:35.356
One lousy minute
of your time.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.315
You owe me that,
don't you think?

38:39.186 --> 38:41.362
Claire, go ahead
and shut the door.

38:49.762 --> 38:52.373
I'm sorry I didn't return
your phone calls.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.637
I thought a clean break
was just better for...

38:55.681 --> 38:56.856
I'm pregnant.

38:58.988 --> 39:00.555
Don't worry.
I don't need anything from you.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.209
I'm not keeping it.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.298
The way you
treated me,

39:04.342 --> 39:06.300
I wasn't even
going to tell you.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.563
But I'm not a bad person.

39:08.607 --> 39:10.826
You have a right to know.

39:13.089 --> 39:15.788
Anyway, that's all
I came here to say, so...

39:15.831 --> 39:17.964
goodbye.

39:18.007 --> 39:19.922
Have a nice life.

39:19.966 --> 39:21.837
Wait.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.413
Simone, thank you so much.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.589
Where's Tommy?They're doing some scans
of his head.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.417
He has a possible concussion.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.288
They need to be sure
there's no swelling.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.681
But he'll be all right?

39:39.725 --> 39:41.335
He's pretty banged up.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.946
He has a bad cut on his leg,
but he'll recover.

39:43.990 --> 39:46.340
Oh, thank God.He was driving while drunk.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.429
I couldn't believe it
when the nurse told me.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.823
Tommy would never...

39:50.866 --> 39:54.348
God. What's happened to my boy?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.916
I feel so awful.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.570
You're so sweet to be here.

39:58.613 --> 40:01.660
Even now, when you're going
through your own hell.

40:01.703 --> 40:02.704
What do you mean?

40:02.748 --> 40:05.359
I know about Karl,

40:05.403 --> 40:07.187
how he's sick
with that gay disease.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.319
I don't know
what you've heard, but...

40:09.363 --> 40:11.496
Ida Coy told me.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.498
She was in one of the stalls

40:13.541 --> 40:15.674
when you were talking
to Dr. Bennett's wife.

40:15.717 --> 40:18.416
Oh, God. Well, please
don't tell anyone else.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.026
Karl would be so upset.

40:20.069 --> 40:21.636
I don't care about Karl.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.378
You're the one
I'm concerned for.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.206
Are you okay?

40:26.249 --> 40:28.687
Well, I don't have it,
if that's what you're asking.

40:28.730 --> 40:30.515
Well, I hope not.

40:30.558 --> 40:33.343
No one seems to know how
those people are spreading it.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.303
NURSE:
We brought
your son to a room

40:36.346 --> 40:38.261
if you want to see him.Yes, please, let's go.

40:38.305 --> 40:40.046
Oh, but we can only allow
family back there.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.961
Oh, Simone is
practically family.

40:42.004 --> 40:43.615
Sorry, it's policy.

40:43.658 --> 40:44.616
It's fine.
Just-just

40:44.659 --> 40:46.182
call me later.I will.

40:46.226 --> 40:48.446
And I will be there for you
when you need me.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.069
TAYLOR:
Truth is,
I fell in love with Jade

41:03.112 --> 41:06.202
without really knowing
who she was.

41:08.335 --> 41:12.165
And what's worse is
I brought her into my home.

41:15.473 --> 41:19.085
Now she's sleeping in my bed
and I'm living in a hotel.

41:19.128 --> 41:21.130
I need her out of my house.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.482
But she's enabling
my drug addict husband

41:24.525 --> 41:27.223
and I don't think
he'll just let her go.

41:27.267 --> 41:30.444
Not to mention the fact that you
and I both know how intensely

41:30.488 --> 41:32.751
she can react
when she feels threatened.

41:32.794 --> 41:37.407
If I'm gonna get her out of
the house, I need to be smart.

41:37.451 --> 41:39.235
I need leverage.

41:39.279 --> 41:42.412
And I thought you might be just
the person to help me with that.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.197
Why would I help you?

41:44.240 --> 41:47.853
I'm thinking, you scratch
my back, I scratch yours.

41:47.896 --> 41:50.290
All you got to do is
tell me where it itches.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.858
They set my bail at $10,000.

41:52.901 --> 41:56.078
They seem to think
I'm dangerous.

41:56.122 --> 42:00.779
Well, as luck would have it,
I brought my checkbook.

42:03.608 --> 42:07.394
Well, in that case,
how can I help?

42:07.437 --> 42:09.614
Tell me everything
you know about Jade.

42:09.657 --> 42:13.356
Well, for starters,
that's not her real name.

42:14.619 --> 42:16.490
Oh, shit.

42:16.534 --> 42:19.798
Hold on, darling.
You ain't heard nothing yet.

42:23.671 --> 42:26.544
Oh. Oh, my poor baby.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.548
How is his leg?

42:30.591 --> 42:33.551
Well, he needed
some stitches,

42:33.594 --> 42:36.902
but he will be good
as new in no time.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.604
What in the world?

42:45.911 --> 42:47.956
NURSE:
Who's Simone?

42:48.000 --> 42:49.523
That his girlfriend?

42:51.003 --> 42:53.440
Bit young
for a tattoo.

42:55.964 --> 42:57.966
One day he's gonna
regret that.

43:01.535 --> 43:03.537
So will she.

43:08.498 --> 43:10.457
Hey there.

43:10.500 --> 43:11.850
How you feeling?

43:11.893 --> 43:13.503
Better,
now that you're here.

43:13.547 --> 43:15.941
Aw. Need help with anything?

43:15.984 --> 43:18.857
Oh, I'm just peeling potatoes.
I think I can handle it.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.859
I'm gonna change clothes.

43:20.902 --> 43:24.776
When I'm done, I'll come down
and set the table for you.

43:24.819 --> 43:26.908
You're sweet.

43:33.828 --> 43:35.003
Leo.

43:35.047 --> 43:36.265
What are you doing here?

43:36.309 --> 43:37.876
Where's Rob?

43:37.919 --> 43:40.052
He just went upstairs.
Is something wrong?

43:40.095 --> 43:41.488
Yeah, you need
to come to our house.

43:41.531 --> 43:43.664
You got a phone call
from you-know-who.

43:43.708 --> 43:45.753
She said
it's important.

43:45.797 --> 43:47.712
Oh.

43:47.755 --> 43:50.410
And Sheila wanted me to tell you

43:50.453 --> 43:52.630
this is the last time
she's doing this for you.

43:52.673 --> 43:54.457
She's still angry with me?

43:54.501 --> 43:56.808
Yeah, something like that.

44:02.465 --> 44:05.033
Do you think I'm
a horrible person?

44:05.077 --> 44:08.254
Nah, I think
you're a nice lady

44:08.297 --> 44:11.692
who's gotten herself
in a real fucking mess.

44:21.571 --> 44:23.573
We're here.

44:28.013 --> 44:29.667
Is she serious?

44:29.710 --> 44:31.669
Oh, yeah.

44:35.455 --> 44:36.804
Hello?

44:36.848 --> 44:38.632
Sheila. What took you so long?

44:38.676 --> 44:40.678
Long story.
I-Is everything okay?

44:40.721 --> 44:43.550
Better than okay.
Everything is wonderful.

44:43.593 --> 44:45.117
Tell me.Well,

44:45.160 --> 44:48.642
I went to Rob's office to let
him know that I'm pregnant.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.252
You did what?

44:50.296 --> 44:52.385
I figured the S.O.B.
had a right to know.

44:52.428 --> 44:54.387
Anyway, I stormed into
his office and I blurted it out,

44:54.430 --> 44:57.303
and do you know
what that big galoot did?

44:57.346 --> 44:58.608
No.

44:58.652 --> 45:00.045
He got down on one knee

45:00.088 --> 45:02.525
and asked me
if I would marry him.

45:03.744 --> 45:05.920
But no, but he's still married.

45:05.964 --> 45:07.748
That's what I said.

45:07.792 --> 45:09.532
But he told me
that his marriage is ending.

45:09.576 --> 45:11.534
He said he just needs
six months.

45:13.232 --> 45:15.060
Six months.

45:15.103 --> 45:16.496
And then

45:16.539 --> 45:18.063
he'll be totally free.

45:20.195 --> 45:21.762
Oh.

45:21.806 --> 45:23.851
Anyway, I just wanted
to call to tell you first.

45:23.895 --> 45:25.766
Now I have to call
and tell my mother.

45:25.810 --> 45:26.985
Oh, Sheila.

45:27.028 --> 45:29.770
I am so happy.

45:39.388 --> 45:44.263
Uh, I would ask if
everything's okay, but, uh,

45:44.306 --> 45:47.483
I don't think I'm allowed
to talk to you anymore.

45:47.527 --> 45:49.529
So...
