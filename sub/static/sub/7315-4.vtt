WEBVTT

00:04.604 --> 00:05.738
Bobby, bobby, bobby.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.373
How many times I gotta tell you?

00:07.375 --> 00:08.774
I don't do water-filled.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.109
Well, because--

00:10.111 --> 00:13.012
At best, they leak,
and at worst,

00:13.014 --> 00:15.214
You get black mold,
that's why.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.082
Yeah.

00:17.084 --> 00:18.617
Yeah, you got some, uh,

00:18.619 --> 00:20.052
Buckwheat-fill you
want to unload,

00:20.054 --> 00:22.688
I could trade a case
of corduroy pillows.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.722
They're great
for making headlines.

00:23.724 --> 00:27.359
Get it? Head lines?

00:27.361 --> 00:28.727
(chuckles):
Pillow humor.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.365
Hmm.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.733
Let me call you back, all right?

00:34.735 --> 00:35.801
(phone beeps)

00:42.042 --> 00:43.108
(sighs)

01:28.421 --> 01:33.158
(phones ringing)

01:33.860 --> 01:35.227
Not smart.
(gasps)

01:35.229 --> 01:36.295
Tony catches you
snooping, he'll...

01:36.297 --> 01:39.364
I don't even want to get
inside his head to guess.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.599
I wasn't snooping.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.101
I-I-I wasn't.
I wasn't snooping.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.136
I just came up, uh,
for a signature

01:44.138 --> 01:46.839
From agent dinozzo and something
on his desk caught my eye.

01:46.841 --> 01:49.174
Yeah? Something on my desk
ever catch your eye?

01:49.176 --> 01:50.809
(laughs)

01:52.780 --> 01:56.148
Jimmy, we need to respect
each other's privacy.

01:56.150 --> 02:00.285
I know, it's just
I couldn't help myself.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.154
Tony's not the kind of guy
that writes a handwritten note.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.156
And who's jessica?

02:04.158 --> 02:07.359
Tony says that she's
a wonderful person

02:07.361 --> 02:08.861
And she deserves...

02:08.863 --> 02:10.829
"nothing but happiness.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.599
I'm incredibly sorry
for..." for what?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.134
He doesn't say.

02:15.136 --> 02:15.901
Tony: That's because
it's not done.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.836
And it's none of your business.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.172
Jim. Tim.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.707
I'm a little surprised,
snooping at my desk.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.475
Particularly you, james palmer.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.711
I'm very angry with you,
and I will get more angry

02:25.713 --> 02:28.147
In five, four, three...

02:28.149 --> 02:30.849
What?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.317
Jessica is that
dancer you dated.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.819
Like, four years ago.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.654
No comment.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.855
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.490
What are you,
in some kind of

02:38.492 --> 02:40.926
12-step program for
recovering misogynists?

02:44.430 --> 02:47.633
These past few
weeks have been...

02:47.635 --> 02:51.203
Interesting, haven't they?

02:51.205 --> 02:54.406
It's just got me thinking about

02:54.408 --> 03:00.212
And the people, you know,
that we let in

03:00.214 --> 03:02.714
Or don't let in and...
Just trying to make it better.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.249
Any more questions?

03:04.251 --> 03:06.218
Yeah, what'd you do
with the real tony?

03:06.220 --> 03:08.387
Maybe this is the real tony.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.655
Woman:
Grab your gear.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.723
Mcgee:
Excuse me?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.492
Who let you out of
the polygraph room?

03:13.494 --> 03:14.660
Agent gibbs.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.562
He called and asked
me to help you two

03:16.564 --> 03:18.197
Collect evidence
at your crime scene.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.832
We don't have a crime scene.

03:20.834 --> 03:21.900
You do now.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.902
But you don't collect evidence.

03:23.904 --> 03:28.440
Well, the times they are
a-changing, boys.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.542
That's the third person
in the last week

03:30.544 --> 03:32.277
Gibbs has had tag
along with us.

03:32.279 --> 03:35.981
Almost makes me think he
doesn't trust us by ourselves.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.624
The store owner who
leased out the apartment

03:45.626 --> 03:46.992
Says her name
is patricia moreno.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.260
Officers responding

03:48.262 --> 03:50.629
To the 911 found
this and called us.

03:50.631 --> 03:51.730
Thanks.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.266
It's worse than we thought.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.335
She's applying for
a full-time position.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.502
Criminal investigator.

03:57.504 --> 04:00.439
Gibbs is conducting
the preliminary review.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.873
(whispering):
What's the plan?

04:01.875 --> 04:04.509
She's not going to be as easy
to chase away as the others.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.510
Tony (whispering):
Listen, we can't

04:05.512 --> 04:06.712
Let gibbs know
that she annoys us.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.480
He'll think
we feel threatened.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.915
Which he'll like.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.316
The owner see anything?

04:11.318 --> 04:13.318
No, he leased her
the apartment

04:13.320 --> 04:14.553
Two-and-a-half
years ago,

04:14.555 --> 04:16.355
Sold sergeant moreno a pillow...

04:16.357 --> 04:17.789
Then barely
saw her again.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.524
Says she kept
mostly to herself.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.026
We overheard
your interview.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.527
It was very well done.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.563
Really? How so?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.531
Well, um...

04:26.533 --> 04:27.733
See, it had

04:27.735 --> 04:29.001
All of the, uh...

04:29.003 --> 04:30.569
Oop, look, there's ducky.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.305
Ducky:
Yeah, the first recorded
use of a pillow

04:33.307 --> 04:34.873
Was in 7,000 b.C.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.341
Of course, back then,

04:36.343 --> 04:38.844
Only the wealthy could
afford such luxury.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.313
And now look at what
30 bucks can get you.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.348
(jimmy chuckles)

04:43.350 --> 04:44.650
Oh, I've always
wanted a body pillow.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.451
You done shopping, palmer?

04:46.453 --> 04:51.290
Well, actually, I have
a buckwheat knee pillow on hold.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.624
Yeah, you see,
the interesting thing

04:52.626 --> 04:53.959
About buckwheat is that...

04:56.062 --> 04:57.596
Well, never mind.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.365
Oh, hello.
Hello.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.401
What have we here?

05:02.403 --> 05:04.336
A mess.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.804
Ducky:
Oh, dear god.

05:05.806 --> 05:10.008
This is clearly the result
of some kind of acid.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.044
And since I doubt she
would have sat still for it,

05:12.046 --> 05:15.047
Probably dispensed
post-mortem.

05:15.049 --> 05:18.050
Jimmy:
Could make the cause of
death difficult to determine,

05:18.052 --> 05:21.053
Especially if it was
head trauma.
Ducky:
Yeah.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.621
Perhaps the point.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.089
Well, let's get
this young lady back

05:24.091 --> 05:28.026
Before we speculate further
on how she died.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.696
We can speculate on why, duck.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.464
Nothing appears
to be missing...

05:32.466 --> 05:35.967
Which suggests
this wasn't a robbery.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.069
Mcgee, where was she assigned?

05:37.071 --> 05:39.104
Nowhere.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.374
Sergeant moreno
died in afghanistan

05:42.376 --> 05:44.710
Almost three years ago.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.044
Well...

05:46.046 --> 05:48.013
Then who the hell is she?

05:57.890 --> 05:59.691
Tony:
The real sergeant moreno
was killed by an I.E.D.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.760
In afghanistan three years ago.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.028
Her body was sent
back through dover

06:03.030 --> 06:04.996
And buried in her
kansas hometown.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.966
Best we can tell,
somewhere along the ride home,

06:07.968 --> 06:10.369
Her military I.D.
Was stolen

06:10.371 --> 06:13.071
And then used by whoever this is
to create a new identity.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.574
Mcgee:
The imposter used the I.D.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.008
To get her credit card,
driver's license,

06:17.010 --> 06:18.977
Even an amazon prime
account.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.546
Tony:
Same height, same build.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.081
How'd the imposter
get the I.D.?

06:23.083 --> 06:24.516
We confirmed
that it was sent home

06:24.518 --> 06:25.617
With sergeant moreno's
possessions

06:25.619 --> 06:29.921
But susan spoke to the family,
and they said it never arrived.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.457
She's asking around,

06:32.459 --> 06:34.626
But I wouldn't hold my breath.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.895
Wouldn't hold my breath? Why?

06:36.897 --> 06:39.097
He means that susan's
a polygraph lady,

06:39.099 --> 06:40.766
Not really
a people person.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.634
But we love her.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.770
We think
she's great, so...

06:44.772 --> 06:46.405
We're cool with it.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.006
You're cool with what?

06:49.976 --> 06:52.077
(groans)

06:52.079 --> 06:54.479
It's obvious you're looking
to hire a replacement.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.982
Motive?

06:56.984 --> 06:59.050
I don't know, maybe you
think we need the help.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.886
Three's a magic number?
Who knows?

07:00.888 --> 07:03.188
But we don't need
anyone else, boss.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.923
And we don't want
anyone, either.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.591
I was talking about the murder.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.059
But if you two
feel threatened...

07:08.061 --> 07:11.196
No! Not threatened.
No. No, no, no, no, no.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.831
What's the motive?!

07:12.833 --> 07:14.966
Right.

07:14.968 --> 07:19.037
Was working as a maid
at a nearby motel.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.705
A lot of drug deals
going on around there.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.107
At least a few
homicides a year.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.676
We're thinking maybe she saw
something that got her killed.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.111
Dinozzo, motel.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.913
Mcgee, find out
if ducky

07:27.915 --> 07:29.714
Has decontaminated the body.

07:29.716 --> 07:32.551
Who is she? Find out!

07:35.588 --> 07:37.689
Mcgee:
Hey, abby.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.191
Ducky said you pulled some
prints on our jane doe.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.126
Any luck?

07:41.128 --> 07:44.196
Is that what you think
happens in here?

07:44.198 --> 07:46.097
No, I just meant...

07:46.099 --> 07:48.166
It's Tuesday,
so no backtracking.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.903
Our victim's fingers were too
badly burned for a positive I.D.

07:51.905 --> 07:55.474
However, I did identify
what chemical was used.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.776
Hydrofluoric acid is its name,

07:57.778 --> 07:59.845
And dissolving skin is its game.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.213
Too bad it's
readily available

08:01.215 --> 08:04.216
As a wheel cleaner in pretty
much every auto-parts store.

08:04.218 --> 08:09.120
However, I did have some "luck"
with the victim's necklace.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.655
There is dna on here,

08:10.657 --> 08:13.492
Which could belong
to the killer, so stay tuned.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.793
But I learned
something interesting

08:14.795 --> 08:17.729
About the stone itself.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.164
It's a lapis lazuli,

08:19.166 --> 08:22.667
Mined almost exclusively
in afghanistan.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.203
And on the back
there's an inscription.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.271
"to nadira."

08:26.273 --> 08:27.973
What language is that?

08:27.975 --> 08:30.742
It's pashto.
Also out of afghanistan.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.277
So now we have
a country of origin.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.145
Yeah, and we might
have more,

08:34.147 --> 08:38.149
A job application from
a motel where she worked.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.885
She filled this out
last year.

08:42.088 --> 08:45.023
She used her sergeant
moreno identity.
Yeah.

08:45.025 --> 08:45.924
Whoa!

08:45.926 --> 08:47.692
Look who she has listed

08:47.694 --> 08:49.761
As her "in case of emergency."

08:49.763 --> 08:52.163
Leyla shakarji.
Isn't that...

08:52.165 --> 08:55.000
Mike franks' daughter-in-law.

08:55.002 --> 08:59.070
Tony:
Motel manager didn't have much
to say about the victim

08:59.072 --> 09:02.073
Except she showed up
on time and worked hard.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.708
It was a dead end.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.577
Gibbsy!

09:06.879 --> 09:08.046
Hey, hey.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.314
Come on, I got you.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.183
(playful grunting)

09:13.319 --> 09:14.786
Getting big.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.122
Are you coming over?

09:17.124 --> 09:19.624
Can we play
twister again?

09:19.626 --> 09:22.060
Let me talk to your
mom for a minute.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.162
Go and play on
the swings, amira.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.631
I'll be with you
in a moment.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.733
Why do I have
a feeling

09:28.735 --> 09:30.635
This is not a social call?

09:30.637 --> 09:32.037
I want to ask you
about a case.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.071
Of course.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.639
Anything.

09:34.641 --> 09:37.008
You know her?

09:41.280 --> 09:43.348
No.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.283
Leyla, she put you down

09:45.285 --> 09:48.720
As her emergency contact
on a job application.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.256
Has there been an emergency?

09:51.258 --> 09:53.258
Yeah, she was murdered.

09:55.027 --> 09:56.094
How?

10:04.136 --> 10:06.738
I only met her a few times.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.907
Mike introduced us.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.843
He asked me to look out for her
when he was gone.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.212
Tony:
Who is she?

10:14.214 --> 10:16.081
I don't know.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.616
How did mike know her?

10:17.618 --> 10:19.250
He wouldn't say.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.854
And I never saw her again
after he died.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.023
He must have told you
something about her.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.059
He didn't tell me anything.
And I didn't push it.

10:28.061 --> 10:31.029
You know as well as I do, when
mike asks you to do something,

10:31.031 --> 10:33.865
It's better not to ask
too many questions.

10:33.867 --> 10:38.403
I'm sorry, I wish
I could tell you more.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.673
Come for dinner soon?

10:50.883 --> 10:54.152
What was mike franks into, boss?

10:56.222 --> 10:57.322
Franks:
<i>How's it coming?</i>

10:57.324 --> 10:59.658
Slow.

10:59.660 --> 11:03.361
I could stop smoking
and buy you some more time,

11:03.363 --> 11:06.698
But don't know if my lungs
could take the shock.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.267
What is that?
German renaissance?

11:09.269 --> 11:11.036
Just give me
something flowery.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.204
I like flowers.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.178
Anything else?

11:20.180 --> 11:23.682
Actually, I...
Need another favor.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.317
(quietly):
Hey. Come on.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.286
It's okay.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.388
Come on.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.857
Gibbs, this is elina.

11:35.728 --> 11:37.996
I need to leave her with you
for a few days.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.998
Excuse me?!

11:40.000 --> 11:42.867
Oh, I bet you heard it
just fine.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.303
Don't worry,
she speaks less english

11:45.305 --> 11:47.305
Than you do pashto.

11:47.307 --> 11:50.809
Mike... This is not a hotel.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.745
I'm right in the
middle of a case.

11:53.747 --> 11:54.913
I know.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.816
There's no one else I can trust.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.819
It's... It's like that.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.987
Oh...

12:05.925 --> 12:08.226
All right... All right...
But I... But I got...

12:08.228 --> 12:10.028
No questions!

12:10.030 --> 12:12.397
I can't just take in
a teenage girl,

12:12.399 --> 12:14.365
No questions asked.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.402
You come to me
all the time for help, probie.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.337
Now I'm coming to you.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.107
I need help.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.760
Tony: <i>Is it me,</i>
<i>or did it seem like</i>

12:41.762 --> 12:43.061
<i>Leyla was holding out on us?</i>

12:43.063 --> 12:45.330
I know
she's almost family but...

12:45.332 --> 12:47.132
Wouldn't be the first time.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.200
Plus, anytime you add
mike franks to the mix,

12:49.202 --> 12:51.402
Anything's possible.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.940
She could be mike franks'
daughter... Girlfriend, maybe.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.942
Although,
that's kind of creepy.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.912
Almost as creepy as you
playing twister.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.514
(laughing)

13:02.516 --> 13:04.282
(coughs)

13:06.352 --> 13:08.520
Something on
your mind, boss?

13:08.522 --> 13:10.188
Yeah.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.791
(phone ringing)

13:12.793 --> 13:14.225
I got it.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.226
Mcgee.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.227
You're on speaker.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.228
No bad-mouthing the boss.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.330
What?! I've never...

13:19.332 --> 13:21.232
Gibbs:
What do you got, mcgee?

13:21.234 --> 13:25.036
Um, we got a hit on the dna
from our victims' necklace.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.038
Mcgee: His name is
farshad sarabi.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.573
He emigrated from afghanistan
ten years ago.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.041
He have a record?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.876
Mcgee: Just a history
of domestic violence.

13:31.878 --> 13:35.814
He just happens to work
at an auto parts store,

13:35.816 --> 13:38.950
Which just happens to sell
hydrofluoric acid.

13:38.952 --> 13:43.054
Put out a bolo; get a warrant
to search his place.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.889
Mcgee:
You got it, boss.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.458
Bye.

13:50.062 --> 13:51.429
Sure you don't want
to talk about it?

13:52.998 --> 13:56.501
Guess that means you don't want
any fries, either.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.269
(railroad crossing bell
dinging)

13:58.271 --> 14:00.405
(train horn blowing)

14:00.407 --> 14:01.940
Hmm?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.141
No. No.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.209
Mm.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.615
Gibbs:
Mike should be here soon.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.017
He told me
to meet him here.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.186
Mike...

14:15.188 --> 14:17.021
Good.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.556
(chuckling)

14:18.558 --> 14:19.991
Mike good.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.493
Depends on the day.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.494
Hm.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.596
(laughs)

14:24.598 --> 14:26.197
But he does have
his moments.

14:37.142 --> 14:40.979
(toy clicking, whirring)

14:40.981 --> 14:43.882
Where are your parents?

14:44.617 --> 14:47.051
Your mother? Your father?

14:53.158 --> 14:55.226
Sold me.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.295
To man.

15:02.134 --> 15:03.968
What man?

15:03.970 --> 15:06.905
Hu-hu-husband.

15:09.441 --> 15:10.909
Old.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.510
L-like you.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.650
(laughing)

15:18.652 --> 15:21.119
It's okay.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.320
(laughs quietly)

15:22.322 --> 15:24.589
It is all right.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.257
Hm.

15:29.295 --> 15:33.031
Ducky: Acid attacks were all
the rage in 19th century europe.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.467
It wasn't until acid shortages
in world war ii

15:36.469 --> 15:38.202
That they started to decline.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.637
See? There's a bright
side to everything.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.105
Even global war.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.141
What do you got, duck?

15:43.143 --> 15:45.076
Well, contrary to mr. Palmer's

15:45.078 --> 15:47.145
Crime-scene speculation,

15:47.147 --> 15:50.715
Acid was not used to cover up
the cause of death.

15:50.717 --> 15:54.319
In high enough doses,
hydrofluoric acid

15:54.321 --> 15:56.220
Can cause cardiac arrest.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.689
You're saying her death
was an accident?

15:57.691 --> 16:01.326
The goal was to maim
this woman, jethro.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.528
And if she died, she died.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.397
We may have stumbled
on an honor killing.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.465
Palmer:
I'm sorry-- a what?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.467
An honor killing,
mr. Palmer,

16:09.469 --> 16:12.036
Is when a relative is murdered

16:12.038 --> 16:14.005
For bringing dishonor
on the family.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.974
It's a brutal custom.

16:15.976 --> 16:19.210
Women can be killed for
refusing an arranged marriage;

16:19.212 --> 16:25.149
Or just for being
a lovesick teenager.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.718
Being caught kissing a boy.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.587
Ducky: It's a misnomer,
if I ever heard one.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.089
I mean,
there is no honor involved.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.359
Whoever did this is
a stone-cold killer.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.227
Who's about to feel the pain.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.595
Bolo came back
on our suspect, boss.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.163
Rockville pd's got him.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.198
Okay.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.399
So what are you
doing here?

16:41.401 --> 16:44.235
Leaving.

16:45.404 --> 16:49.440
I sincerely hope you put the
screws to this one, jethro.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.075
Will do.

16:51.077 --> 16:53.177
Well, this may help you
with your interrogation.

16:53.179 --> 16:57.615
Our victim has scars from
a lifetime of beatings.

16:57.617 --> 17:01.753
She was persecuted simply
for being a woman.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.625
(conversing quietly,
indistinctly)

17:10.296 --> 17:12.764
Man:
Thank you very much.

17:12.766 --> 17:13.798
Franks:
See you soon.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.138
(car door opens)

17:22.441 --> 17:25.176
(groans, sighs)

17:26.278 --> 17:27.745
What's going on?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.081
Why the fake I.D.?

17:31.283 --> 17:34.352
About a year ago,
some former--

17:34.354 --> 17:36.387
Let's say associates--

17:36.389 --> 17:40.691
Come up to me because they had
a 12-year-old afghan girl

17:40.693 --> 17:44.195
Who they were helping
smuggle into the u.S.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.630
Okay, stop.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.465
I can't hear
any more of that.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.700
You need to.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.136
This girl had been
raped repeatedly

17:52.138 --> 17:53.738
By her uncle.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.274
When she finally
went to the police,

17:56.276 --> 17:58.509
They arrested her.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.278
For what?

18:00.280 --> 18:04.315
For being outside
without a male escort.

18:04.317 --> 18:07.185
Without her uncle,
for pete's sake.

18:07.187 --> 18:10.721
I was just supposed
to help with the one.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.590
But when I met the kid--

18:12.592 --> 18:16.127
This sweet, innocent child--

18:16.129 --> 18:18.296
It ain't something
you let go.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.231
So I hooked up
with this group

18:20.233 --> 18:23.568
That runs women's
shelters in kabul.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.504
I kind of run
their underground railroad.

18:26.506 --> 18:30.308
You know, helping them
relocate their hard cases.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.544
Mike, I can hear the "but"
that's coming a mile away.

18:33.546 --> 18:37.615
(chuckles) <i>but</i> with all
this border fence talk,

18:37.617 --> 18:39.817
It's getting to be
harder and harder

18:39.819 --> 18:42.720
To get the girls in.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.389
Even harder to get them
set up with the fake I.D.'s.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.492
What do you want?

18:47.494 --> 18:49.327
(sighs)

18:49.329 --> 18:54.532
I need you to put a space "a"
travel request in the system.

18:54.534 --> 18:58.703
Authorizing military
transport

18:58.705 --> 19:01.672
From kabul to el salvador.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.383
This is for six people.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.452
Six    <i>refugees.</i>

19:14.454 --> 19:16.854
I'll take care
of everything else.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.157
That's all
you need to know.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.668
I can't wait for gibbs
to give this guy hell.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.270
Mcgee:
Same here.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.405
You'll...

19:34.407 --> 19:36.807
Have to settle for me.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.276
You?

19:38.278 --> 19:41.812
Gibbs wants me to talk
to the suspect.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.481
Tony (scoffs):
Look...

19:43.483 --> 19:45.483
This isn't taking pictures
at a crime scene,

19:45.485 --> 19:46.417
This is an
interrogation.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.418
Yeah.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.287
If only I had experience

19:49.289 --> 19:52.690
And trying to figure out
if they were lying.

19:52.692 --> 19:56.527
And the investigator job
I want is in san diego.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.331
We are gonna miss you.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.933
I'm sure.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.467
Now, let's get started.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.904
We found a list of names
in the suspect's apartment.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.206
All afghan, all women.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.674
Mcgee: Each name is
linked to the name

20:09.676 --> 20:11.842
Of a deceased servicewoman.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.478
We think the afghan girls
are using them

20:14.480 --> 20:16.681
As fake identities,
just like our victim did.

20:16.683 --> 20:20.318
She's on the list too--
crossed off.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.752
So are two others.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.487
This is a hit list.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.850
(mouthing)

20:52.852 --> 20:54.885
She's pissing him off, tony.

21:04.329 --> 21:05.563
How do I look?

21:05.565 --> 21:07.531
You look stupid.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.433
Like a painted clown.

21:11.503 --> 21:14.472
Prefer something more...

21:14.474 --> 21:16.540
Like... This?

21:18.710 --> 21:21.445
She was living in the u.S.,

21:21.447 --> 21:23.414
Hiding under
a stolen identity

21:23.416 --> 21:26.384
When you somehow
found out what it was,

21:26.386 --> 21:28.819
Tracked her down
and killed her.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.422
That about right?

21:32.824 --> 21:35.359
I assume...

21:35.361 --> 21:38.396
That's the plan for
everyone on your list.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.398
List?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.667
I don't know what
you're talking about, list?

21:42.669 --> 21:43.868
Okay, cut the bull--

21:43.870 --> 21:46.537
We have hydrofluoric acid
in your trunk,

21:46.539 --> 21:47.905
Your handwriting
on a hit list,

21:47.907 --> 21:51.809
And your dna at the crime scene.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.612
I've not only got
you dead to rights

21:54.614 --> 21:56.847
On this one,
I'm gonna make it

21:56.849 --> 22:00.851
My life's mission
to pin these other two on you.

22:00.853 --> 22:05.456
You're here 'cause I just
need to know one thing.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.858
I need to know why.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.094
Can't stand that

22:10.096 --> 22:12.530
Women are smarter
than men, yeah?

22:12.532 --> 22:15.032
Or maybe

22:15.034 --> 22:17.034
It's 'cause we see you

22:17.036 --> 22:19.804
At your weakest

22:19.806 --> 22:21.939
And most vulnerable.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.474
Don't talk to me that way.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.576
They brought shame and dishonor
to their families.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.545
They were punished
in accordance to god's law.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.680
Is that who you work for?

22:29.682 --> 22:32.683
I provide a service
to those who need it.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.120
Where did you get this list?

22:37.489 --> 22:40.024
It does not matter where.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.126
What matters is

22:42.128 --> 22:46.063
We have the names they're using
to hide in this country.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.099
We will find them.

22:48.101 --> 22:51.435
You may have been able
to stop me,

22:51.437 --> 22:55.139
But someone else
will come for them.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.778
All these women were smuggled
into the us

23:00.780 --> 23:01.912
And given fake identities?

23:01.914 --> 23:04.382
By whom?

23:04.384 --> 23:05.516
It's not our priority
right now.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.818
Who has been leaking
these new identities

23:07.820 --> 23:09.520
To those hit men?

23:09.522 --> 23:11.522
You think it's someone
here in afghanistan?

23:11.524 --> 23:12.590
It's why I'm calling you.

23:12.592 --> 23:13.991
You are the liaison to the only

23:13.993 --> 23:15.760
Un women's rights group
in the country.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.662
If these are honor killings,

23:18.664 --> 23:20.631
The girls' families
probably got together

23:20.633 --> 23:21.899
To hire your hit man,

23:21.901 --> 23:23.601
Which means any
of a thousand people

23:23.603 --> 23:24.902
Could be the source.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.737
The targets are all
on this same list.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.440
They've got
to have something in common.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.775
They do.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.843
My records show that
at one time or another,

23:32.845 --> 23:35.112
They all stayed at the same
women's shelter outside kabul.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.480
I know it well.

23:36.482 --> 23:37.681
Okay, let's start there.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.016
Prepare a rack.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.719
I'll be there in 18 hours.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.988
You going to afghanistan, boss?

23:43.990 --> 23:45.856
You just got back
from the middle east.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.525
I'm sure they can handle this.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.660
(door closes, sighs)

24:03.542 --> 24:05.609
(horn honking)

24:11.716 --> 24:13.884
(engine stops)

24:13.886 --> 24:16.020
(dog barking distantly)

24:17.856 --> 24:19.657
Here we are.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.759
Noor women's shelter.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.894
Oh, it looks more
like a bomb shelter.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.063
Gorman:
They're lucky to have this.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.598
They get zero support
from the community.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.900
That's putting it mildly, tom.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.069
The locals think
women's shelters

24:32.071 --> 24:33.904
Are fronts for brothels,

24:33.906 --> 24:35.706
Which is why they're all run
by foreign ngos.

24:37.175 --> 24:39.076
You must be agent gibbs.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.511
Catherine tavier.

24:40.513 --> 24:41.745
I manage this shelter.

24:42.581 --> 24:43.981
Well, let's talk inside

24:43.983 --> 24:45.583
Before someone thinks
you're customers

24:45.585 --> 24:46.951
And shoot at you.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.591
(speaking pashto)

25:10.108 --> 25:12.610
The girls don't know
about nadira.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.678
They don't speak english.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.947
Are you sure it was her?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.616
You tell us.

25:26.124 --> 25:29.593
How did her family find her?

25:29.595 --> 25:32.563
You really think one of nadira's
family members had her killed?

25:32.565 --> 25:35.599
They're the only ones
who'd care enough.

25:35.601 --> 25:38.135
If you can forgive
my choice of words.

25:38.137 --> 25:41.038
But even if you find out
who it was,

25:41.040 --> 25:42.873
You'll never get a conviction.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.141
Not here.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.277
There are women in danger.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.978
Women that you know.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.080
Were you aware
that after nadira left here,

25:50.082 --> 25:51.315
She was smuggled into the us

25:51.317 --> 25:53.017
And living
under a false identity?

25:53.019 --> 25:55.886
On the record, no.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.856
Off the record,
I may have heard a thing or two.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.058
Though, sadly,

26:01.060 --> 26:03.894
That conduit
to the us has closed.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.997
Because someone leaked
her real identity.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.733
We're bringing those women
into protective custody,

26:09.735 --> 26:11.302
But to really protect them,

26:11.304 --> 26:13.737
We're gonna need to find out
who's leaking their cover names.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.774
I'm the only one
who knew them all,

26:16.776 --> 26:18.842
Aside from the girls here.

26:18.844 --> 26:21.679
We were the only ones
who could be trusted.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.714
Gonna need to talk to them.

26:23.716 --> 26:26.050
They would have shared
that information.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.351
They know what it could mean.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.688
Still gonna need
to talk to them.

26:31.957 --> 26:34.992
Lieutenant gorman and I
can translate.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.961
Yeah.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.996
Mcgee, go with the lieutenant.

26:47.906 --> 26:50.908
It's nice to finally meet.

26:50.910 --> 26:54.745
Mike franks spoke
very highly of you.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.651
Franks:
<i>I need you</i>

27:00.653 --> 27:03.187
<i>To put a travel request</i>
<i>in the system.</i>

27:03.189 --> 27:04.755
Gibbs:
It's for six people.

27:04.757 --> 27:07.024
Six refugees.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.927
(sighs)

27:33.952 --> 27:36.020
♪

27:41.393 --> 27:43.727
(speaking pashto)

27:53.405 --> 27:55.806
She says she doesn't know
who would leak any names

27:55.808 --> 27:57.708
And she would die
before doing so herself.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.743
Please tell her thank you.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.821
Yeah, some of
the most horrible stories

28:10.823 --> 28:12.189
I've ever heard.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.424
I tell you, though,
I got my eye

28:13.426 --> 28:15.693
On that girl
in the bottom right bunk.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.728
She's been squirrely
ever since we got here.

28:17.730 --> 28:18.829
(phone rings)

28:18.831 --> 28:19.897
Oh, there's tony.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.865
Maybe he's had better luck.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.001
(indistinct conversations)
ah, finally.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.102
Ladies, please,

28:25.104 --> 28:26.170
Can you keep it down.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.071
This is long-distance.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.105
What do you got, dinozzo?

28:28.107 --> 28:29.440
I have a headache, boss.

28:29.442 --> 28:30.841
Susan and I

28:30.843 --> 28:32.476
Got all the women
from the hit list.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.778
She's looking into safe houses,

28:34.780 --> 28:36.113
And, uh, (clears throat)

28:36.115 --> 28:38.749
I got a call into immigration.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.117
Why?

28:40.119 --> 28:41.351
Well, because all these women

28:41.353 --> 28:43.020
Are here illegally, boss.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.388
We're not sending them home,
dinozzo.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.990
Mcgee:
They're not safe here, tony.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.426
You call dhs and you request
temporary asylum.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.228
That'll keep them busy
for a while.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.197
Okay, that's why
we call you the boss.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.498
(speaks pashto)

28:56.301 --> 28:57.801
(shouting in pashto)

29:06.878 --> 29:08.512
<i>Mor</i> means mother.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.114
Her daughter was sent

29:10.116 --> 29:12.015
To america first.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.350
The mother was to follow.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.119
Unfortunately,
that never happened

29:15.121 --> 29:17.488
When mike franks died.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.289
(crying)

29:19.291 --> 29:21.291
(speaking pashto)

29:32.203 --> 29:35.272
It's the first time they've
seen each other in two years.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.173
(glass shattering)

29:36.175 --> 29:38.008
(screaming)

29:38.977 --> 29:40.244
Tony, I'll call you back.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.245
Wait, mcgee...

29:50.155 --> 29:51.822
Boss, you see anything?

29:51.824 --> 29:53.257
No.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.059
Everybody's okay.

29:56.061 --> 29:57.895
Catherine:
It's been a rough week.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.063
This is nothing.

30:00.065 --> 30:02.933
Though, this late probably means
it's going to be a rough night.

30:05.003 --> 30:08.438
Franks:
<i>Have you lost all shred</i>
<i>of human decency?</i>

30:08.440 --> 30:10.307
This is not a game.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.442
This is life or death
to these women!

30:12.444 --> 30:14.077
You don't know that.

30:14.079 --> 30:15.579
The hell I don't!

30:15.581 --> 30:17.214
These girls are in danger.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.483
Even in the shelters.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.319
And when the us finished
its military pull-out,

30:22.321 --> 30:24.421
It's game over for them.

30:24.423 --> 30:27.191
Look at them.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.259
Look at their faces.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.930
I'm a federal agent,

30:32.932 --> 30:35.365
And I cannot lend
material support

30:35.367 --> 30:37.367
To a human smuggling operation.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.269
When did you start
caring about the rules?

30:39.271 --> 30:40.404
My rules.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.105
Yeah? Which ones?

30:42.107 --> 30:43.607
Rule ten.

30:43.609 --> 30:46.009
Never get personally involved
on a case.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.312
Rule 14, bend the line,

30:48.314 --> 30:49.580
Don't break it.

30:49.582 --> 30:52.082
Human smuggling breaks it.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.251
You already got involved once.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.854
Or don't you remember how
leyla and amira got here?

31:01.125 --> 31:03.126
How do you choose, mike?

31:03.128 --> 31:05.495
Huh? Who do you pick?

31:05.497 --> 31:07.397
You can start it,

31:07.399 --> 31:09.299
But how do you stop it?

31:09.301 --> 31:12.302
You're not god.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.605
He's sitting this one out.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.874
I can't do it.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.111
Can't do it.

31:32.257 --> 31:34.157
Easy, easy.
You'll break the frame.

31:36.327 --> 31:38.095
That's all of them, boss.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.329
You find the leak?

31:39.331 --> 31:40.297
No.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.199
Think maybe catherine was right.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.468
These women would never
sell each other out.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.337
(phone ringing)

31:47.339 --> 31:50.440
Girl I was talking to was
almost beaten to death

31:50.442 --> 31:52.542
By her father for kissing a boy.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.478
The one in the back right
ran away

31:54.480 --> 31:56.446
From an arranged marriage
when she was 13.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.382
13, boss.
Yeah.

31:58.384 --> 32:02.386
On the other hand,
if they're the only ones

32:02.388 --> 32:03.487
That had the info,

32:03.489 --> 32:04.922
The leak has to be here.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.390
Yes, sir.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.658
We have to leave.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.059
Now.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.394
What's going on?

32:10.396 --> 32:12.062
My office just got intel
that a group of locals

32:12.064 --> 32:13.397
Is planning something
after sundown tonight.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.699
That's almost now.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.100
Planning what?

32:17.102 --> 32:18.368
It sounds
like another bonfire.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.337
They're usually a little
too close for comfort.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.439
Well, we need to
call the police.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.507
Not a good idea.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.474
They usually bring the gasoline.

32:24.476 --> 32:28.478
An urgent request
to any un forces in the area,

32:28.480 --> 32:30.414
But we've been ordered
back to base.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.382
Maybe your girls

32:32.384 --> 32:34.418
Can find someplace else
to go as a precaution.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.153
Well, you know as well as I do,

32:36.155 --> 32:37.688
They don't have
any place else to go.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.589
We wait for backup.

32:39.591 --> 32:42.459
Agent gibbs, we're prohibited
by our rules of engagement

32:42.461 --> 32:44.428
From lending any support
in these situations.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.563
It's very tricky
geopolitically.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.365
We have our orders.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.500
We need to leave.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.282

the first time

33:07.519 --> 33:08.552
We've gotten
intel like this.

33:08.554 --> 33:12.189
But if we stay, it is
guaranteed to turn violent.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.124
We need to leave now.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.594

Let me guess.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.109
Actually, I don't even need to.

34:39.111 --> 34:40.610
Agent mcgee,
we have our orders.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.145
We need to leave now.

34:43.481 --> 34:44.815
Then go.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.550
I'm staying.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.587
What is it with
these guys from ncis?

34:50.589 --> 34:52.489
What do you need?
Mcgee: Well, supposedly,

34:52.491 --> 34:53.657
There's reinforcements
on the way, but...

34:53.659 --> 34:54.791
I'll see what we have

34:54.793 --> 34:55.792
In the area.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.094
All right, when you're done,

34:57.096 --> 34:58.295
Go by mtac,

34:58.297 --> 35:00.197
Check satellite coverage
on our location.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.199
Maybe you can see something
that we can't.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.500
Okay. On it.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.601
Be careful, tim.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.304
Yeah.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.475
(hammering)

35:15.480 --> 35:17.280
Wet some blankets.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.149
We can stuff them
under the doors

35:19.151 --> 35:20.617
If we need to get
the smoke out.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.818
Rear is secure.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.353
Anything else
I can help with, boss?

35:23.355 --> 35:26.123
I.D. All lines of sight.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.325
Cover all approaches, mcgee.

35:29.427 --> 35:32.462
Mcgee:
You know, I don't see
why we all just don't

35:32.464 --> 35:34.698
Take a walk around the block
till the cavalry arrives.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.299
It's too risky.
This could all be

35:36.301 --> 35:38.268
Just a gambit to get us
to leave the shelter.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.569
We're safer inside.

35:42.540 --> 35:43.540
Mcgee, ammo.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.175
Got a full mag in my sig.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.409
Two extra in my pack.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.546
You have access to any weapons?

35:50.515 --> 35:52.149
I'm not so fond of guns,

35:52.151 --> 35:54.351
But I've been keeping
one around.

35:59.624 --> 36:01.391
Don't shoot yourself.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.460
(gunfire, women screaming)

36:03.462 --> 36:05.495
Everybody down.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.463
Mcgee.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.776
Mcgee:
I got nothing.

36:19.778 --> 36:22.445
(cell phone rings)

36:22.447 --> 36:23.613
(sighs)

36:23.615 --> 36:25.749
Tony, it's a bad time
right now.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.517
Just got off the horn
with a u.N. Commander.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.453
Well, they better be quick.
We just got fired on.

36:30.455 --> 36:32.622
Satellite's coming online.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.191
Tony:
Okay, there we go.

36:34.193 --> 36:35.592
We got five bogeys
inbound, mcgee.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.727
On foot, moving slow.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.730
I don't see 'em.

36:44.669 --> 36:45.735
I got 'em.

36:49.473 --> 36:51.474
Tony:
Are you still there, mcgee?

36:51.476 --> 36:53.243
Mcgee:
We're here, tony.

36:58.416 --> 37:01.251
They've got molotov cocktails.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.652
They're not planning a bonfire.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.355
Well, you're not going to talk
your way out of this,

37:05.357 --> 37:07.924
You're going to have
a mob on your hands.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.627
The locals aren't big fans
of americans.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.501
Outside kabul, there has been
yet another car bombing.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.538
The target this time
was a women's shelter

37:21.540 --> 37:24.774
Run by a french group
called les femmes déterminée.
(door creaks open)

37:24.776 --> 37:27.877
Six afghan women were reportedly
killed during the blast.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.413
The only survivor
was a french national,

37:30.415 --> 37:32.949
Catherine tavier,
who ran the shelter.

37:32.951 --> 37:36.486
I could've got
them out, probie.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.656
Some of them were just kids.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.392
Mcgee:
We can't run.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.461
We can't negotiate.
We can't fight.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.329
So what are we going to do?

37:50.001 --> 37:51.835
Tony:
All right,
they're coming, mcgee.

37:55.373 --> 37:56.973
We stand.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.842
Which means what exactly?

38:02.513 --> 38:04.514
These guys are bullies.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.349
You stand up to bullies,
right, mcgee?

38:06.984 --> 38:08.852
Cover me.
What?

38:08.854 --> 38:11.721
Boss, you're going out there?

38:22.900 --> 38:25.568
Tony:
Mcgee, what is he doing?

38:25.570 --> 38:27.570
He's doing what he does, tony.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.339
Where's our backup?

38:29.341 --> 38:30.340
Working on it.

38:30.342 --> 38:31.941
Well, work faster.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.459
(chuckling)

38:52.596 --> 38:54.631
(speaks pashto)

39:13.684 --> 39:15.752
He's going to get
himself killed.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.688
I think I may die
of a heart attack first.

39:19.957 --> 39:22.392
(men chuckling,
murmuring quietly)

39:24.562 --> 39:25.762
(gunshot)

39:25.764 --> 39:28.431
(men yelling)

39:30.401 --> 39:32.369
Grid 097...
Where's our air
and ground support?

39:32.371 --> 39:34.637
We need it now.
We're out of time.

39:34.639 --> 39:35.939
There's too many of them.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.842
If I shoot one of them,
gibbs is dead.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.678
He's already dead.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.721
What's going on?
Sitrep, mcgee.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.023
You've been on the other side
of that look, tony.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.625
Take a guess.

40:04.034 --> 40:06.770
(speaks pashto)

40:14.044 --> 40:15.745
(yelling)

40:24.422 --> 40:25.922
(speaking pashto)

40:28.426 --> 40:30.527
(man continues speaking pashto)

40:37.768 --> 40:39.736
(sighs)

40:39.738 --> 40:42.172
Hey, gunny... Got a call
you needed some backup?

40:43.140 --> 40:45.175
Thank you.

40:48.746 --> 40:50.647
I can't believe it.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.482
That was incredible.

40:52.484 --> 40:54.617
Boss, you saved the shelter.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.720
For now, mcgee.

40:57.722 --> 40:59.923
What about tomorrow?

41:07.465 --> 41:08.832
Susan:
Agent gibbs took quite a risk

41:08.834 --> 41:10.200
With what he did.

41:10.202 --> 41:11.801
That's how he rolls.

41:13.904 --> 41:16.005
I heard they found the leak.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.707
Yeah.

41:17.709 --> 41:22.512
One of the girls who moved out
of the shelter was threatened.

41:22.514 --> 41:24.080
She had no choice.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.950
You all really care.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.118
About the job, but...

41:29.120 --> 41:31.654
Also about other.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.823
Well, sometimes it's
a pain in the ass.

41:37.161 --> 41:39.229
Susan:
Why do you think gibbs did it?

41:40.731 --> 41:42.799
Tony:
I don't know.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.868
Because he likes
breaking rules, maybe.

41:44.870 --> 41:47.837
I hope he has a better
answer for immigration.

41:47.839 --> 41:51.808
'cause he's going to have some
explaining to do after this.

42:04.855 --> 42:06.589
<i>Mor?</i>

42:06.591 --> 42:08.925
(gasps)

42:08.927 --> 42:10.693
<i>Mor!</i>

42:11.829 --> 42:14.631
(sobbing)

42:25.543 --> 42:28.945
Mike would be
so proud of you.
