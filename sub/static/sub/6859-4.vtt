Mesa never attack da

06:46.940 --> 06:48.039
How is he?

06:48.041 --> 06:49.274
The bandages have stopped the

06:49.276 --> 06:51.643
bleeding, but he's unconscious.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.746
The Gungans are still gathered
and poised to march on Theed.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.348
Boss Lyonie never got a chance
to call off the invasion.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.451
And it's almost dusk.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.319
Jar jar, you're a Senator.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.321
You have to tell them to stand down.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.289
They'll listen to you.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.224
Thesa Gungans are proud.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.993
With theysa mood at the moment,
mesa the last person they'll

07:08.995 --> 07:10.428

07:11.765 --> 07:13.398
I don't believe it.

07:13.400 --> 07:19.370

07:23.810 --> 07:26.478
I didn't realize it until
you put the crown on.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.346
This gives me an idea.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.415
Jar jar, you must put on
Lyonie's robes and keep that

07:30.417 --> 07:31.182
crown on.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.383
Oh, noi, noi.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.585
Mesa can't do that.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.620
You have to if we're going
to convince the Gungan army to

07:35.622 --> 07:36.521
stand down.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.590
But theysa never listen to mesa.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.659

07:41.661 --> 07:45.930
But wesa all don't Look alike.

07:45.932 --> 07:50.635

07:50.637 --> 07:56.221
Our beloved leader, Boss Lyonie, isa dead.

07:58.678 --> 08:04.582
Wesa must honor his last order
and prepare for oursa attack

08:04.584 --> 08:07.285
against the Naboo.

08:07.287 --> 08:13.446
Weesa march with the
separatist droid army on Theed.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.633
Death to the Naboo.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.801
Thisa bad.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.202
Thisa very bad.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.571
Get up there and stop the attack.

08:26.573 --> 08:29.040
Ah, mesa can't do it.

08:29.042 --> 08:32.309
You can't, but Boss Lyonie can.

So... so... I hear you have decided not

10:55.755 --> 10:59.424

11:03.389 --> 11:07.899
Oh yesa... oh yesa.
We must put end to unfortunate--

11:07.901 --> 11:10.101
unfortunate bang-bang conflict.

11:10.103 --> 11:13.604
It was a great effort
and cost for me to bring

11:13.606 --> 11:15.773

11:20.714 --> 11:24.749

11:24.751 --> 11:29.787
If you won't attack the Naboo, I will.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.222
Hold dat thought.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.924
G-General Tarpals?

11:32.926 --> 11:35.326

11:54.147 --> 11:58.750
immediate arrangements for
a Gungan separatist attack.

12:02.689 --> 12:06.524
Senator, mesa has urgent
message from Boss Lyonie.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.827
Hesa say General Grievous isa here.

12:09.829 --> 12:11.229
Grievous is here?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.330
Where's Anakin?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.332
Hesa chasing Risha Loo.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.300
General Tarpals, listen to me.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.569
You must capture Grievous.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.971
But how?

12:19.973 --> 12:22.507
There'sa too many droids helping him.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.276
The droid commander still
thinks you're on the same side.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.478
Have the droids shut down.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.047
Then attack.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.581
Its the only way.

12:30.583 --> 12:36.487
Grievous is a bombad warrior,
but wesa shall do as you say.

12:36.489 --> 12:41.025
I always be believen in the
friendship between Gungans

12:41.027 --> 12:42.260
and the Naboo.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.262
Thank you, General.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.768
What are we waiting for?

13:23.770 --> 13:27.572
Hmm... Planning attack take a time.

13:27.574 --> 13:31.242
You are a man of few words, Boss Lyonie.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.612
Well, uh... Mesa more of a deep thinker.

13:36.716 --> 13:39.417
You are not Boss Lyonie.

13:42.793 --> 13:46.757
You have no idea of the
power within my grasp.

13:47.727 --> 13:48.728
Ding!

13:54.267 --> 13:56.501
Waah!

13:56.503 --> 13:59.137
Uh-oh.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.204
Huh?

14:00.206 --> 14:03.841
Yousa army is shut down, General.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.844
General.

14:06.846 --> 14:12.383
Huh? Mesa suggest you surrender.

14:16.539 --> 14:22.059
You can't be serious?

14:47.419 --> 14:50.288
How does it feel to die?

14:50.920 --> 14:56.442
Not die... sacrifice.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.729
Arrgh.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.731
Jar jar, now.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.648
Arrgh!

15:43.312 --> 15:47.561
This turn of the events is unfortunate.

15:47.563 --> 15:51.198
General Grievous is a critical
part of my plan for the clone

15:51.200 --> 15:52.332
wars.

15:52.334 --> 15:55.402
He must not remain captive.

15:55.404 --> 15:57.504
What is to be done, my lord?

15:57.506 --> 16:02.209
You must lure Skywalker
into a trap, then negotiate

16:02.211 --> 16:04.444
a prisoner exchange.

16:04.446 --> 16:07.147
How can you be certain the
Republic will trade Grievous

16:07.149 --> 16:08.782
for Skywalker?

16:08.784 --> 16:13.020
I have no doubt Senator
Amidala will gladly agree

16:13.022 --> 16:15.022
to your terms.

16:15.024 --> 16:20.027
As you wish, my lord.

16:20.029 --> 16:21.061
Rish Loo.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.729
Yesa, Count?

16:22.731 --> 16:25.432
I am at your secret laboratory.

16:25.434 --> 16:29.069
Meet me here and leave enough
of a trail for Skywalker

16:29.071 --> 16:30.737
to follow you.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.673
I have a surprise waiting

16:32.675 --> 16:34.841
for him.

16:54.868 --> 16:59.433
Master I have done what yousa asked.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.135
Skywalker isa here.

17:02.137 --> 17:04.570
Young Master Skywalker.

17:04.573 --> 17:07.240
You're nothing if not relentless.

17:07.242 --> 17:08.709
What a surprise.

17:08.711 --> 17:09.675
Dooku.

17:09.678 --> 17:12.378
You're a fool, Rish Loo.

17:13.415 --> 17:15.415
Augh!

17:23.574 --> 17:27.728
- Why bring the war to Naboo?
- How quickly you forget.

17:27.730 --> 17:31.632
After all, the war started here years ago.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.634
You were a part of that first battle?

17:33.636 --> 17:35.836
The sith control everything.

17:35.838 --> 17:38.238
You just don't know it.

18:09.036 --> 18:11.238
Augh!

18:45.487 --> 18:47.407
Augh!

19:13.846 --> 19:16.770
Where-sa Ani?
Hesa been gone mooie long time.

19:16.772 --> 19:19.039
I'm not sure, Jar Jar.

19:20.042 --> 19:23.110
Anakin.

19:23.112 --> 19:26.379
Senator Amidala, we meet again.

19:26.381 --> 19:29.483
I must regretfully inform
you that young Skywalker has

19:29.485 --> 19:31.551
been detained.

19:31.553 --> 19:34.187
What have you done with Anakin?

19:34.189 --> 19:37.858
Now, now, Senator, let's
not become emotional.

19:37.860 --> 19:39.059
What do you want, Dooku?

19:39.061 --> 19:41.361
I'm glad you asked.

19:41.363 --> 19:45.665
I could be persuaded to return
Skywalker to you in exchange

19:45.667 --> 19:49.069
for General Grievous.

19:49.071 --> 19:52.606
I--I can't
do that.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.874
I'm sorry.

19:53.876 --> 19:57.344
You soon will be.

19:57.346 --> 19:59.713
Ahhh!

19:59.715 --> 20:01.148
Stop!

20:01.150 --> 20:03.083
You cannot torture a prisoner.

20:03.085 --> 20:04.351
Torture?

20:04.353 --> 20:06.920
I don't know what you mean.

20:06.922 --> 20:09.523
I'll give you an hour to
consider my proposition.

20:09.525 --> 20:13.827
I'm sure you will make the right choice.

20:13.829 --> 20:16.163
Yousa have to trade with him.

20:16.165 --> 20:17.998
I can't, Jar Jar.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.001
With Grievous captured,
we could win the war.

20:21.003 --> 20:25.338
But--but, Padme,
hesa our friend.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.174

20:27.176 --> 20:28.642
I know, Jar Jar.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.044
Mesa think yousa have to deal.

20:31.046 --> 20:32.512
Yousa should listen to Binks.

20:32.514 --> 20:34.514
Hesa right.

20:56.564 --> 20:58.672
Release the General.

21:24.482 --> 21:29.336
- Padme... I'm sorry.
- Shh.

21:29.338 --> 21:31.338
It's all right, Ani.

21:43.557 --> 21:47.354
