00:04.922 --> 00:07.048
I picked this trick up

00:04.922 --> 00:07.048
in camp last year.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.259
This is gonna be great.

00:10.761 --> 00:13.054
Wait for it.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.683
Wait for it...

00:17.100 --> 00:18.143
Oh, screw it.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.737
Oh, man.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.071
What's wrong, Reese?

00:30.113 --> 00:31.323
Nothing! Just-just shut up

00:31.365 --> 00:33.742
and go to sleep, okay?

00:33.784 --> 00:35.744
It's good to be alive.

Hey, Dewey, wake up!

01:15.409 --> 01:17.786
It's Monday morning.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.786
Hooray!

01:17.828 --> 01:19.580
I never thought

01:17.828 --> 01:19.580
I'd be happy about a Monday,

01:19.621 --> 01:22.123
but today's the end of two

01:19.621 --> 01:22.123
months of being grounded.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.292
Two months!

01:24.334 --> 01:26.294
What are you doing?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.923
Shut up! I have to finish

01:26.336 --> 01:28.923
my history homework.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.299
Reese, we couldn't do

01:28.964 --> 01:31.299
anything all weekend.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.384
No friends,

01:32.426 --> 01:35.136
no TV;

01:32.426 --> 01:35.136
we did absolutely nothing.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.598
And you still managed

01:35.178 --> 01:37.598
not to do your homework?

01:37.639 --> 01:39.140
Hey, the point is,

01:37.639 --> 01:39.140
we never should've

01:39.182 --> 01:40.935
been grounded

01:39.182 --> 01:40.935
in the first place.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.143
He is right.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.187
Mom went way overboard.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.398
We didn't even do

01:44.229 --> 01:46.398
anything that bad.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.735
Okay, so if we give you

01:46.440 --> 01:49.735
Dewey's bike,

01:49.777 --> 01:51.779
Circus will eat

01:49.777 --> 01:51.779
a wet dog food sandwich.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.614
Right.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.156
Sounds good.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.156
Okay then.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.742
Wait a minute.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.577
I don't want you ripping off

01:56.784 --> 01:58.577
my little brothers.

01:58.619 --> 02:02.831
You only get the bike

01:58.619 --> 02:02.831
if he eats the whole can.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.960
Done.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.378
You the man, Circus.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.797
You the man.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.763
This is worth it.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.140
What you gonna tell Mom?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.602
(sniffling)

02:25.228 --> 02:27.648
The guy pushed him off...

02:27.689 --> 02:29.190
took the bike...

02:30.651 --> 02:34.446
and then just ran off.

02:36.615 --> 02:37.825
How'd she know we were lying?

02:37.866 --> 02:39.868
We were brilliant.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.621
(muffled groaning)

02:44.289 --> 02:45.833
How's Mom?

02:45.874 --> 02:47.208
Oh, she's got

02:45.874 --> 02:47.208
a temperature of 104.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.377
I've never seen her this sick.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.213
It's like some sort of horrible

02:49.419 --> 02:52.213
science experiment in there.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.800
Mom's been sick

02:52.255 --> 02:54.800
with the flu all weekend.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.636
I'd feel more sympathetic,

02:54.842 --> 02:57.636
but two months with no TV

02:57.678 --> 02:59.847
has killed the part of me

02:57.678 --> 02:59.847
that cares.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.390
I finally figured out

03:02.432 --> 03:03.600
how Mom could tell

03:02.432 --> 03:03.600
we were lying.

03:03.642 --> 03:04.685
How?

03:04.726 --> 03:06.020
Pheromones.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.228
She can smell the fear on us.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.396
Next time you lie,

03:08.438 --> 03:09.857
you have to take a shower first.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.232
HAL:

03:09.898 --> 03:11.232
Okay, boys,

03:11.274 --> 03:12.609
look, I got to go to work,

03:11.274 --> 03:12.609
but before I do,

03:12.651 --> 03:14.235
I want to talk to you

03:12.651 --> 03:14.235
for a minute.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.654
Now, when I get home,

03:15.696 --> 03:18.239
I get to plug this cord

03:15.696 --> 03:18.239
back into the TV.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.242
So you boys have to behave.

03:21.284 --> 03:25.039
You're not the only ones

03:21.284 --> 03:25.039
who've suffered with no TV.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.248
For all I know, there's

03:25.080 --> 03:27.248
a new wrestling champion.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.836
So... I want you to get

03:27.290 --> 03:30.836
to school on time.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.253
And before you leave,

03:30.878 --> 03:32.253
you go in there,

03:32.295 --> 03:34.255
and tell your mother

03:32.295 --> 03:34.255
to feel better.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.841
Maybe we should

03:34.297 --> 03:35.841
just let her sleep.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.425
She slept straight through

03:35.883 --> 03:37.425
the last 48 hours.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.303
I think it's okay

03:37.467 --> 03:40.303
to wake her up for five minutes.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.279
Mom?

03:58.321 --> 03:59.364
(groaning)

04:00.908 --> 04:03.284
You're starting

04:00.908 --> 04:03.284
to look better.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.953
He's not lying.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.288
Mom kills most germs on contact,

04:07.330 --> 04:09.457
but when one does get through,

04:07.330 --> 04:09.457
it's a doozy.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.877
You kids remember

04:11.919 --> 04:13.921
you're not stepping foot

04:11.919 --> 04:13.921
out of this house today.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.296
Huh?

04:13.962 --> 04:15.296
No TV.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.299
No friends... till tomorrow.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.301
But, Mom...

04:18.341 --> 04:20.301
This is the last Sunday

04:20.343 --> 04:21.678
of your punishment.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.513
But...

04:21.720 --> 04:23.513
(coughing)

04:23.555 --> 04:25.974
Okay, Mom, we got it.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.974
We're still grounded.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.560
What are you doing?

04:28.602 --> 04:29.937
Mom slept all weekend.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.688
She still thinks

04:29.978 --> 04:31.688
it's Sunday.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.023
You know what this means?

04:34.399 --> 04:35.525
No.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.111
We can pretend today's Sunday

04:37.152 --> 04:38.319
and stay home from school.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.780
Oh, I'm in.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.322
Okay, Mom.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.366
We're just going to go

04:41.364 --> 04:43.366
continue our punishment.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.743
And we're definitely

04:43.408 --> 04:44.743
not going to school.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.037
(quietly):

04:44.785 --> 04:47.037
Shut up.

Just looking.

Wow.

I love this car.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.159
Yeah.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.369
Oh, I see you've added

05:25.200 --> 05:28.369
four ponies from last year.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.205
We also put in

05:28.411 --> 05:30.205
the new skid control system.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.832
Oh?

05:30.247 --> 05:31.832
Hey, you know,

05:31.873 --> 05:33.250
the new brochures just came in.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.375
I could show you one

05:33.292 --> 05:34.375
if you want.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.004
No, I-I-I should get to work.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.380
Sir, can I ask,

05:39.422 --> 05:42.550
is your job really so important

05:42.592 --> 05:46.387
that you can't allow yourself

05:42.592 --> 05:46.387
five minutes of pleasure?

05:46.429 --> 05:50.225
I have no response to that.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.020
Yes!

05:51.434 --> 05:53.020
All right!

05:53.061 --> 05:54.771
All right, this'll be great!

05:54.813 --> 05:56.397
Yes!

05:56.439 --> 05:59.234
No, wait, we can't.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.234
Someone will see us.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.401
We're supposed

05:59.276 --> 06:00.401
to be in school.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.279
Okay.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.072
We'll just stay inside

06:02.321 --> 06:04.072
and watch T...

06:04.114 --> 06:06.407
Oh, dang!

06:06.449 --> 06:08.493
Just give me

06:06.449 --> 06:08.493
some time to think.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.593
Come on, already,

06:23.300 --> 06:25.593
think of something!

06:25.635 --> 06:27.304
I'm trying.

06:27.346 --> 06:28.638
All I've got

06:27.346 --> 06:28.638
are all the reasons

06:28.680 --> 06:30.849
this was a stupid idea

06:28.680 --> 06:30.849
in the first place.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.433
Even if we manage

06:30.891 --> 06:32.433
to keep Mom fooled,

06:32.475 --> 06:34.435
we're screwed as soon

06:32.475 --> 06:34.435
as Dad gets home.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.813
It basically means

06:34.477 --> 06:36.813
we're gonna sit here

06:36.855 --> 06:38.439
bored out of our minds

06:36.855 --> 06:38.439
for eight hours

06:38.481 --> 06:41.235
and wait for Mom to

06:38.481 --> 06:41.235
top our last punishment.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.443
How could you be so stupid?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
I could've done that myself.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.906
(phone ringing)

06:45.947 --> 06:48.075
Get it before Mom wakes up!

06:50.493 --> 06:52.037
(deep voice): Hello.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.037
FRANCIS: Look, Mom.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.081
It's all a pack of lies!

06:52.079 --> 06:54.081
I had nothing to do with it!

06:54.122 --> 06:55.707
Seriously, I was

06:54.122 --> 06:55.707
nowhere near that place...

06:54.122 --> 06:55.707
Francis?

06:55.749 --> 06:56.833
It's Francis? Let me talk.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.833
Oh! Oh!

06:56.875 --> 06:57.834
Come on, let me talk! Please?

06:57.876 --> 06:58.877
What are you guys doing home?

06:58.919 --> 06:59.878
MALCOLM:

06:58.919 --> 06:59.878
Mom's sick.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.129
She thinks it's Sunday.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.505
We kind of went with it.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.132
Cool.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.926
Oh, dude, I need you to do me

07:04.174 --> 07:05.926
a giant favor.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.468
Go check the mail.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.512
Okay, there should be

07:07.510 --> 07:09.512
a letter there

07:09.554 --> 07:11.514
from Southern Alabama State.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.641
Yeah, it's here.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.476
Why, did you apply there?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.476
No.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.478
There's probably no point

07:15.518 --> 07:17.478
in me ever trying to.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.065
I kind of drove a backhoe

07:17.520 --> 07:20.065
into their swimming pool.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.277
Oh, man. Did they have

07:20.107 --> 07:23.277
to drain the pool?

07:23.318 --> 07:24.485
No, if you put

07:23.318 --> 07:24.485
a ten-foot crack in them,

07:24.527 --> 07:26.071
they pretty much

07:24.527 --> 07:26.071
drain themselves.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.488
They did have to drain

07:26.113 --> 07:27.488
the gym, though.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
Ooh.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
But I have a plan.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.700
I want you to take the letter

07:30.742 --> 07:32.160
and hide it.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.494
Okay, and then what?

07:33.536 --> 07:34.746
And then hopefully...

07:34.788 --> 07:36.497
I'll come up

07:34.788 --> 07:36.497
with a good idea later.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.292
That's all I got so far.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.501
Yeah, we're kind of

07:38.333 --> 07:40.501
in the same boat.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.962
We're stuck in the house

07:40.543 --> 07:41.962
with nothing to do.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.381
You guys should go down

07:42.003 --> 07:44.381
to the arcade on Hillcrest.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.507
The manager there has

07:44.423 --> 07:46.507
a pretty enlightened outlook

07:46.549 --> 07:48.135
about a kid's right to choose

07:46.549 --> 07:48.135
his own school hours.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.677
We don't have

07:48.176 --> 07:49.677
any money, though.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.305
All right, you guys

07:49.719 --> 07:51.305
are doing me a favor,

07:51.346 --> 07:53.307
so I'm gonna let you in

07:51.346 --> 07:53.307
on a little secret.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.515
Mom keeps some money

07:54.557 --> 07:56.684
in the top left drawer

07:54.557 --> 07:56.684
of her dresser,

07:56.726 --> 07:58.186
but she won't notice

07:58.228 --> 08:00.521
if you only take

07:58.228 --> 08:00.521
between five and seven dollars.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.531
What are

08:09.030 --> 08:10.531
you boys doing?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.533
Looking for

08:10.573 --> 08:12.533
our money.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.534
It's not there.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.578
I moved it

08:13.576 --> 08:15.578
to the back of the closet.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.373
Where she hides

08:15.620 --> 08:18.373
her Christmas presents?

08:18.415 --> 08:19.540
No...

08:19.582 --> 08:22.169
I moved those to the attic.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.426
Um, Mom, where'd you hide

08:26.756 --> 08:29.426
that football

08:29.468 --> 08:31.011
I broke the window with?

08:31.052 --> 08:32.429
In the garage.

08:32.471 --> 08:35.556
And when you made

08:32.471 --> 08:35.556
chipped beef on toast

08:32.471 --> 08:35.556
last week,

08:35.598 --> 08:36.808
was that really beef?

08:36.850 --> 08:37.934
Who knows?

08:37.976 --> 08:40.395
It was 39 cents a pound.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.566
Did Grandpa really

08:42.272 --> 08:45.566
punch Jimmy Carter in the face?

08:45.608 --> 08:48.945
No, he just threw a rock

08:45.608 --> 08:48.945
at the motorcade and ran off.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.365
Did you really give

08:48.987 --> 08:51.365
my red blanket to the poor kids?

08:51.406 --> 08:55.076
No, your father used it

08:51.406 --> 08:55.076
to clean the barbecue.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.578
I was really adopted,

08:56.203 --> 08:57.578
wasn't I?

08:57.620 --> 09:02.376
Oh, you're ours...

08:57.620 --> 09:02.376
and we love you.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.543
Damn.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.588
So, um...

09:07.630 --> 09:09.799
I don't know.

09:09.841 --> 09:10.967
What's your

09:09.841 --> 09:10.967
favorite color?

09:11.009 --> 09:14.595
For the third time, green.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.972
Let's just go.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.016
Wait.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.976
I got a good one.

09:20.018 --> 09:23.188
How'd you know Dewey's bike

09:20.018 --> 09:23.188
wasn't really stolen?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.605
That is a good one.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.235
Francis told me.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.621
I can't believe it!

09:38.578 --> 09:40.621
Francis ratted on us to Mom!

09:40.663 --> 09:41.622
No!

09:41.664 --> 09:44.209
He wouldn't do that.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.209
You did it!

09:44.251 --> 09:45.668
Shut up!

09:44.251 --> 09:45.668
He sold us out!

09:45.710 --> 09:47.628
Francis is dead

09:45.710 --> 09:47.628
to us now!

09:47.670 --> 09:49.672
Wait a minute--

09:49.714 --> 09:51.674
that makes me

09:49.714 --> 09:51.674
the oldest brother.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.009
Guys, seriously--

09:53.051 --> 09:55.636
if you have any problems,

09:53.051 --> 09:55.636
you can come to me.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.888
Dewey, get me some ice tea.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.098
No!

09:59.474 --> 10:01.476
We should just give this to Mom

09:59.474 --> 10:01.476
and let him fry.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.269
Right.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.311
No, wait!

10:03.353 --> 10:04.645
It's Francis.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.107
We can't just take

10:04.687 --> 10:07.107
Mom's word for it.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.276
Hey, Malcolm, everything okay?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.902
Um, Francis...

10:10.944 --> 10:13.029
we were just

10:10.944 --> 10:13.029
wondering...

10:13.071 --> 10:14.822
Mom said...

10:14.864 --> 10:17.658
you ratted on us

10:14.864 --> 10:17.658
about Dewey's bike.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.661
But she's probably

10:17.700 --> 10:20.661
just mixed up, right?

10:20.703 --> 10:23.248
Because you're our big brother

10:20.703 --> 10:23.248
and you wouldn't do

10:23.290 --> 10:24.707
something like

10:23.290 --> 10:24.707
that-- Francis?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.084
You don't know

10:26.126 --> 10:27.835
what kind of pressure

10:26.126 --> 10:27.835
I was under!

10:27.877 --> 10:28.836
You butt-wipe!

10:28.878 --> 10:30.046
How could you?

10:30.088 --> 10:31.339
Well, did he do it?

10:31.381 --> 10:32.673
I can't believe you!

10:32.715 --> 10:33.674
You're our big brother!

10:33.716 --> 10:35.843
You're supposed

10:33.716 --> 10:35.843
to protect us,

10:33.716 --> 10:35.843
not betray us.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.471
He did it, didn't he?

10:37.512 --> 10:39.473
Malcolm, just let me explain...

10:37.512 --> 10:39.473
And then you actually

10:39.514 --> 10:42.267
have the nerve to ask us

10:39.514 --> 10:42.267
to risk our butts for you?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.685
Maybe we should just

10:42.309 --> 10:44.685
give the letter to Mom.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.938
No, you can't do that!

10:44.727 --> 10:46.938
Yeah, why not?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.107
Because if you give

10:46.980 --> 10:49.107
the letter to Mom,

10:49.149 --> 10:50.691
she'll know it's not Sunday.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.694
I'll just tell her it

10:50.733 --> 10:53.694
came special delivery.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.696
Yeah, well, she won't believe it

10:55.738 --> 10:57.865
'cause she would have

10:55.738 --> 10:57.865
to sign for it.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.700
I could forge

10:57.907 --> 10:59.700
her signature.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.702
But then she'll know

10:59.742 --> 11:01.702
you can forge her signature.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.870
Which won't

11:01.744 --> 11:02.870
matter at all

11:02.912 --> 11:04.539
because she'll be

11:02.912 --> 11:04.539
so mad at you,

11:04.581 --> 11:06.707
she won't even think

11:04.581 --> 11:06.707
about me for a few days.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.502
And even if she does,

11:06.749 --> 11:08.502
I'll just tell her

11:08.543 --> 11:09.710
I didn't want

11:08.543 --> 11:09.710
to disturb her.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.129
So in addition to

11:09.752 --> 11:11.129
you getting nailed,

11:11.171 --> 11:12.713
I'll get points for

11:11.171 --> 11:12.713
being sympathetic.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.092
Put Reese on the phone.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.303
You know, Hal,

11:16.134 --> 11:18.303
owning a Porsche

11:18.345 --> 11:20.721
is not just for

11:18.345 --> 11:20.721
the wealthy anymore.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.723
My lifemate and I,

11:20.763 --> 11:22.723
we both drive 'em.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.891
Really?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.684
Oh, she's a very

11:23.933 --> 11:25.684
lucky lady.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.148
Oh. A blond.

11:32.775 --> 11:33.985
This is going to

11:32.775 --> 11:33.985
sound clichéd, Hal,

11:34.027 --> 11:35.903
but what can I do to put you

11:34.027 --> 11:35.903
in that car today?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.905
You can give me $90,000.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.782
(both laughing)

11:39.824 --> 11:41.201
That's funny.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.785
Yeah.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.785
Seriously, we have

11:42.827 --> 11:45.746
all kinds of financial plans

11:42.827 --> 11:45.746
available.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.747
(sighs)

11:46.789 --> 11:48.333
Why don't we take it

11:46.789 --> 11:48.333
for a test drive?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.335
Nah, I... I don't know.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.587
I would have to call work and...

11:52.629 --> 11:54.381
There's a phone...

11:54.422 --> 11:56.424
in the car.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.595
So, do we give Mom

11:59.177 --> 12:00.595
the letter now

12:00.637 --> 12:02.805
or wait till Dad gets home

12:00.637 --> 12:02.805
and give him both barrels?

12:02.847 --> 12:04.015
Now!

12:04.057 --> 12:05.766
Do it now!

12:05.808 --> 12:06.934
We're not giving

12:05.808 --> 12:06.934
Mom the letter.

12:06.976 --> 12:07.977
Of course we are!

12:08.019 --> 12:09.020
We have to!

12:09.062 --> 12:09.979
He's a traitor!

12:10.021 --> 12:11.231
He has to pay!

12:11.272 --> 12:12.607
He must suffer!

12:12.649 --> 12:14.651
We can't give

12:12.649 --> 12:14.651
Mom the letter.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.651
She'd kill him.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.362
But we can make him

12:14.693 --> 12:17.362
think we're giving

12:14.693 --> 12:17.362
her the letter.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.446
We could make

12:17.404 --> 12:18.446
him think

12:18.488 --> 12:20.031
we're scuzzy,

12:18.488 --> 12:20.031
dirty backstabbers

12:20.073 --> 12:21.575
just like he is.

12:21.616 --> 12:22.783
Oh, okay.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.786
(phone rings)

12:25.828 --> 12:27.788
Hello.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.788
Hey, it's me.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.165
Well, if it isn't

12:27.830 --> 12:29.165
the snitch.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.791
Hi, snitch.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.377
Come on, Malcolm.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.837
Let's just end this

12:32.419 --> 12:34.837
before it gets out

12:32.419 --> 12:34.837
of control.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.381
I know how you

12:34.879 --> 12:36.381
guys feel.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.174
You do, huh?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.174
How do we feel?

12:38.216 --> 12:40.801
Well... bad.

12:40.843 --> 12:41.802
No.

12:41.844 --> 12:42.970
The words that

12:41.844 --> 12:42.970
come to my mind

12:43.012 --> 12:46.974
are revenge,

12:43.012 --> 12:46.974
payback, envelope.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.018
Malcolm, you're not going

12:47.016 --> 12:49.018
to give Mom the letter.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.479
I don't think you're in

12:49.060 --> 12:51.479
any position to call the shots.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.814
No, but... Richie should be

12:51.521 --> 12:53.814
right about now.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.442
Richie?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.442
Yeah?

12:57.860 --> 13:01.406
That was the best 12 minutes

12:57.860 --> 13:01.406
of my life.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.199
Well, I'm glad

13:01.448 --> 13:03.199
to hear that, Hal.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.410
You know, there are

13:03.241 --> 13:05.410
a couple of people

13:05.452 --> 13:06.703
I'd like you to meet.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.627
FRANCIS:

13:11.874 --> 13:13.627
Okay, listen up:

13:13.668 --> 13:16.837
my mom's in her bedroom,

13:13.668 --> 13:16.837
so you gotta keep it down,

13:16.879 --> 13:19.090
and remember,

13:16.879 --> 13:19.090
don't hurt my brothers.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.216
(glass breaking)

13:20.258 --> 13:21.842
Circus!

13:21.884 --> 13:23.261
It's okay. It was ugly.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.638
Man, just get the letter

13:24.679 --> 13:26.847
and don't let Malcolm

13:24.679 --> 13:26.847
out of your sight.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.433
He's too smart.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.517
Uh-oh.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.102
What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

13:29.559 --> 13:31.102
What did he do?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.270
He's out of breath.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.439
Damn it!

13:32.312 --> 13:34.439
He hid the letter.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.690
Okay, kid,

13:34.481 --> 13:35.690
you've got

13:35.732 --> 13:36.857
three seconds to tell me

13:36.899 --> 13:38.526
or I'm going to pound you

13:36.899 --> 13:38.526
within an...

13:38.568 --> 13:39.860
Richie!

13:39.902 --> 13:41.279
Which part

13:39.902 --> 13:41.279
of "no hurting my brothers"

13:41.321 --> 13:42.322
didn't you understand?

13:42.363 --> 13:43.657
I got to tell you, man,

13:43.698 --> 13:44.865
you're not allowing me

13:44.907 --> 13:46.743
a single creative

13:44.907 --> 13:46.743
thought here.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.911
(whispering):

13:46.785 --> 13:48.911
Where'd you put it?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.330
In the VCR.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.330
I know.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.872
If we set fire

13:50.371 --> 13:51.872
to the house,

13:51.914 --> 13:53.874
Malcolm will go

13:51.914 --> 13:53.874
right for the letter.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.543
Why would he go

13:53.916 --> 13:55.543
right for the letter?

13:55.585 --> 13:58.463
Well, maybe we should

13:55.585 --> 13:58.463
just set fire to the

13:55.585 --> 13:58.463
house and find out.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.047
Put Justin on the phone.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.882
You the man, Francis.

14:01.924 --> 14:02.883
You the man!

14:02.925 --> 14:04.552
Put Richie back on the phone.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.346
Hey, you can tear up

14:04.594 --> 14:06.346
the house if you want

14:06.387 --> 14:08.348
with my mom here

14:06.387 --> 14:08.348
and explain it to her

14:08.389 --> 14:10.057
or you can quit

14:08.389 --> 14:10.057
and slink away

14:10.099 --> 14:12.893
like the monosyllabic

14:10.099 --> 14:12.893
mouth-breathers you are.

14:12.935 --> 14:13.936
What'd he say?

14:13.978 --> 14:15.480
He said a lot of things,

14:15.522 --> 14:18.566
but the gist of it is,

14:15.522 --> 14:18.566
we got to tear up the house.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.694
No, you can't do that. Just...

14:20.735 --> 14:22.278
wait a minute,

14:20.735 --> 14:22.278
I have an idea.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.530
Look at Reese.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.781
What's he doing?

14:24.823 --> 14:26.324
He's just

14:24.823 --> 14:26.324
sitting there.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.284
No, look at his eyes.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.284
What are his eyes doing?

14:28.326 --> 14:29.703
They're looking back at me.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.329
Okay, just keep looking at him.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.099
He's looking at the VCR.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.728
No, I-I was looking at the...

14:52.141 --> 14:54.728
the other thing.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.437
Bingo! We got it!

14:58.398 --> 15:01.108
JUSTIN:

14:58.398 --> 15:01.108
You're the man, Richie!

15:01.150 --> 15:02.360
All right!

15:02.402 --> 15:04.445
Who wants a latte?

15:08.783 --> 15:10.326
I'm really sorry,

15:08.783 --> 15:10.326
you guys.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.952
For what?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.204
You were perfect.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.540
You did exactly

15:13.246 --> 15:15.540
what I thought you'd do.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.417
What are you

15:15.582 --> 15:17.417
talking about?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.585
They have a fake letter.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.960
I knew Francis

15:18.626 --> 15:19.960
wouldn't leave us alone

15:20.002 --> 15:20.961
without getting something

15:21.003 --> 15:22.797
and I knew you'd give it away.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.216
I knew exactly

15:22.839 --> 15:25.216
what everyone would do.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.967
So where's the

15:25.258 --> 15:26.967
real letter?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.845
I had to think

15:27.009 --> 15:28.845
of the one place

15:28.887 --> 15:30.388
they'd never think

15:28.887 --> 15:30.388
of looking.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.972
I had to give it

15:30.430 --> 15:31.972
to the one person

15:32.014 --> 15:32.973
they'd never think

15:33.015 --> 15:33.974
I'd give it to.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.351
I did the most

15:34.016 --> 15:35.351
brilliant thing of all:

15:35.393 --> 15:36.561
I gave it to Dewey.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.979
And I hid it

15:36.603 --> 15:38.979
under Mom's pillow.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.398
You what?!

15:49.407 --> 15:51.992
I'm gonna kill him.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.036
I am going

15:52.034 --> 15:54.036
to kill him!

15:54.078 --> 15:57.039
(making ghostly sounds)

15:57.081 --> 15:59.166
This is all a dream.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.251
Oh, shut up, Reese!

16:00.293 --> 16:01.210
Mom, stop it.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.253
You're sick.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.588
I'm too mad to be sick.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.590
No, he has finally

16:03.630 --> 16:05.590
done it this time.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.883
Where is that brochure

16:06.925 --> 16:08.676
for the work farm

16:06.925 --> 16:08.676
in Arizona?

16:08.718 --> 16:11.596
He thinks military school

16:08.718 --> 16:11.596
is tough?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.890
Just wait.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.850
Wait.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.269
Wait...

16:18.311 --> 16:19.395
wait...

16:19.437 --> 16:20.897
wait!

16:22.440 --> 16:25.025
(Lois retching)

16:25.067 --> 16:26.026
Hey, Malcolm?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.027
Hi, Francis.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.446
Look, I'm sorry about all this.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.489
I shouldn't have

16:29.530 --> 16:30.865
sent those guys over.

16:30.907 --> 16:31.866
It was stupid.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.033
You know, Francis,

16:33.075 --> 16:35.411
we never actually intended

16:33.075 --> 16:35.411
to show the letter to Mom.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.037
We just wanted to scare you.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.205
Yeah, I know.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.707
You guys would never

16:38.247 --> 16:39.707
do that to me.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.041
But if she did see the letter,

16:41.083 --> 16:43.711
you'd know it was just

16:41.083 --> 16:43.711
an accident, right?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.254
Yeah, but Richie has the letter.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.425
Please tell me

16:47.298 --> 16:49.425
Richie has the letter.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.302
Richie has coupons.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.012
Mom has the letter.

16:54.472 --> 16:57.057
But like I said, it was just

16:54.472 --> 16:57.057
an accident. I swear.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.060
So the thing you've been

16:57.099 --> 17:00.060
threatening to do all day

17:00.102 --> 17:03.314
but had no intention of doing,

17:00.102 --> 17:03.314
you did but didn't mean to?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.691
Yeah.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.275
You can yell

17:04.732 --> 17:06.275
at us now.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.944
(sighs)

17:07.986 --> 17:09.487
No, I guess I deserve it.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.072
I shouldn't have ratted

17:09.529 --> 17:12.072
on you guys.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.242
Mom was just really

17:12.114 --> 17:15.242
pressuring me about coming home

17:15.284 --> 17:16.243
and, well, I folded.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.871
Coming home?

17:17.912 --> 17:19.956
Yeah, she said if I wanted

17:17.912 --> 17:19.956
to come home for the summer,

17:19.998 --> 17:21.165
I had to tell her

17:19.998 --> 17:21.165
about the bike.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.253
But that's just a lame excuse.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.589
I'm sorry.

17:32.134 --> 17:36.096
Actually,

17:32.134 --> 17:36.096
that was a pretty good excuse.

17:36.138 --> 17:39.893
Wow, you have made

17:36.138 --> 17:39.893
a great deal here, Hal.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.311
Now, you just, uh,

17:39.934 --> 17:42.311
sign right there

17:42.353 --> 17:43.980
and she's all yours.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.273
Yeah, you know, I-I've

17:44.022 --> 17:46.273
been thinking...

17:46.315 --> 17:49.109
I think maybe I got

17:46.315 --> 17:49.109
a little overexcited.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.778
Aw, that's just the jitters.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.280
They'll be long gone

17:50.820 --> 17:53.280
when you're roaring home

17:53.322 --> 17:54.949
in your brand-new

17:53.322 --> 17:54.949
Porsche.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.325
Just sign.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.325
No, I think

17:56.367 --> 17:57.994
maybe we should

17:56.367 --> 17:57.994
do this another time

17:58.036 --> 17:59.286
because I-I'm not

17:58.036 --> 17:59.286
feeling very well

17:59.328 --> 18:00.371
and my wife has the flu...

18:00.413 --> 18:01.915
I'll tell you what--

18:01.956 --> 18:04.124
let's throw in

18:01.956 --> 18:04.124
the new chrome turbo wheels

18:04.166 --> 18:06.586
and free car washes

18:04.166 --> 18:06.586
for a year-- just sign.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.129
I can't.

18:09.171 --> 18:12.926
But, Hal...

18:12.967 --> 18:15.762
you put your initials

18:12.967 --> 18:15.762
by this number.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.137
Sorry.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.766
Maybe some other time.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.143
Hal, will you do me

18:21.183 --> 18:23.143
one favor?

18:23.185 --> 18:25.312
One favor, now,

18:23.185 --> 18:25.312
I want you just to...

18:25.354 --> 18:28.148
stick your head in the car

18:25.354 --> 18:28.148
one last time, okay?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.150
I want you to smell

18:28.190 --> 18:30.150
the leather,

18:30.192 --> 18:32.152
take another look

18:30.192 --> 18:32.152
at that console,

18:32.194 --> 18:34.154
and tell me you don't

18:32.194 --> 18:34.154
want this car.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.155
Go ahead, do it.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.618
Come on.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.160
(inhaling)

18:40.202 --> 18:41.788
So what do you say?

18:41.829 --> 18:44.164
(retching)

18:44.206 --> 18:46.125
I told you I was sick!

18:55.217 --> 18:56.761
Oh, my God!

18:56.803 --> 18:57.845
You guys,

18:57.887 --> 18:59.346
we can save Francis.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.848
What?!

18:59.388 --> 19:00.848
Think about it--

19:00.890 --> 19:02.182
every time

19:00.890 --> 19:02.182
Mom gets mad,

19:02.224 --> 19:04.393
she forgets about

19:02.224 --> 19:04.393
everything else in the world

19:04.435 --> 19:06.186
except for the things

19:04.435 --> 19:06.186
she's mad at.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.814
That focus is the key

19:06.228 --> 19:07.814
to her power.

19:07.855 --> 19:08.815
So?

19:08.856 --> 19:10.190
So Mom won't care so much

19:10.232 --> 19:11.567
about sending Francis

19:10.232 --> 19:11.567
to a work farm

19:11.609 --> 19:13.987
if she's busy being mad

19:11.609 --> 19:13.987
at someone else, like at us.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.404
We can do that.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.197
Yeah.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.197
You don't

19:15.446 --> 19:17.197
understand.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.366
We're going to have to get

19:17.239 --> 19:19.366
in real trouble,

19:19.408 --> 19:22.202
more trouble than we've ever

19:19.408 --> 19:22.202
been in, in our entire lives.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.205
And we can't make it look

19:22.244 --> 19:25.205
like we're doing it on purpose.

19:25.247 --> 19:28.042
I just want you guys to

19:25.247 --> 19:28.042
know what you're in for.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.919
We owe it to him.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.052
Okay, we got

19:36.467 --> 19:38.052
Dad's skating trophy,

19:38.094 --> 19:39.804
Mom and Dad's

19:38.094 --> 19:39.804
wedding portrait,

19:39.846 --> 19:41.055
Mom's favorite lamp.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.434
No, Dewey, it's stuff

19:42.264 --> 19:45.434
they  like, not you.

19:45.476 --> 19:46.602
Oh.

19:46.644 --> 19:47.645
Good!

19:47.687 --> 19:49.605
Paint?!

19:49.647 --> 19:50.857
Yeah.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.026
That way, we not only

19:50.898 --> 19:53.026
destroy the stuff;

19:53.067 --> 19:54.234
we take out

19:53.067 --> 19:54.234
the driveway,

19:54.276 --> 19:56.236
splash on the house

19:54.276 --> 19:56.236
and, with any luck,

19:56.278 --> 19:57.822
get some

19:56.278 --> 19:57.822
collateral damage

19:57.864 --> 19:59.239
to the neighbors.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.407
What a waste!

20:00.449 --> 20:01.826
For any other reason

20:01.868 --> 20:04.620
this would've been

20:01.868 --> 20:04.620
the funnest thing ever.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.039
(watch beeps)

20:06.080 --> 20:07.247
Okay, guys...

20:07.289 --> 20:10.250
have the last candy bars

20:07.289 --> 20:10.250
of your childhood.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.094
(cheerfully goofy):

20:17.466 --> 20:20.094
Hey! Time to wake up!

20:20.136 --> 20:22.055
Hey!

20:20.136 --> 20:22.055
Time to wake up!

20:22.096 --> 20:26.893
Hey! Time to wake up!

20:26.934 --> 20:29.436
Hey!

20:26.934 --> 20:29.436
Time to wake up!

20:29.478 --> 20:33.273
Hey! Time to wake up!

20:33.315 --> 20:37.277
Hey! Time to wake up!

20:33.315 --> 20:37.277
Hey...

20:37.319 --> 20:39.655
Okay, here she comes.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.657
Now, remember,

21:25.367 --> 21:27.327
Well, I guess

21:25.367 --> 21:27.327
it's mission accomplished.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.748
I don't think Mom even remembers

21:27.369 --> 21:30.748
she has a son named Francis.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.332
LOIS:

21:30.790 --> 21:32.332
Boys!

21:32.374 --> 21:35.544
Just come down.

21:35.586 --> 21:38.338
We're not coming down until you

21:35.586 --> 21:38.338
tell us what you're going to do.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.218
Not going to tell you what I'm

21:38.380 --> 21:42.218
going to do until you come down.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.344
Why don't you

21:42.260 --> 21:44.344
just tell us?

21:44.386 --> 21:47.140
Why don't you just come down?

21:47.181 --> 21:49.349
Tell us.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.349
Come down.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.517
Just tell us!

21:49.391 --> 21:50.517
Come down.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.562
But if you tell us,

21:50.559 --> 21:53.562
we'll come down.
