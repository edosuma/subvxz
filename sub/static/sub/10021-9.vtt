00:07.155 --> 00:08.622
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.823 --> 00:10.916
- Carter!
- I dislocated my shoulder.

00:11.125 --> 00:13.252
How can you improve our department?

00:13.461 --> 00:16.190
You'd benefit from an
eight-bed observation unit.

00:16.397 --> 00:18.922
She's impressive.
She might be our next Chief.

00:19.133 --> 00:22.102
- Doctor, you gave him 50%.
- I've given him a lethal dose!

00:22.303 --> 00:24.294
- He's bradying down.
- Number 8 ET tube.

00:24.505 --> 00:26.632
The cochlear implant is a miracle.

00:26.841 --> 00:29.036
We'll see if your son's a candidate.

00:29.244 --> 00:32.441
Don't feel the need to solicit
medical advice for me.

00:32.647 --> 00:34.911
I brought it up
since I know Kotlowitz.

00:35.116 --> 00:37.084
- Lf you'd rather I hadn't...
- Yeah. I do.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.821
<i>One hundred bottles of beer</i>
<i>On the wall</i>

00:46.027 --> 00:48.018
<i>One hundred bottles of beer</i>

00:48.229 --> 00:51.687
<i>Take one down</i>
<i>Pass it around</i>

00:51.900 --> 00:53.231
<i>One hundred bottles...</i>

00:53.434 --> 00:56.301
- I've never heard one go so long.
- It's like forever.

00:56.504 --> 01:01.168
He can't even count. Never drops
to 99, 98. Just back to 100.

01:01.376 --> 01:05.471
So you don't mind that he's loud and
smells bad? Just that he can't sing?

01:05.680 --> 01:08.513
<i>A hundred bottles of beer</i>
<i>Take one down</i>

01:08.716 --> 01:10.343
Sorry. It's catchy.

01:10.551 --> 01:11.540
Who's on?

01:11.753 --> 01:13.846
General Lee, but she's in a meeting.

01:14.055 --> 01:15.852
Don't call her that to her face.

01:16.057 --> 01:18.924
Our new Chief of Emergency?
Would I do that?

01:19.127 --> 01:21.891
We need some Ativan
to put him out of our misery.

01:22.096 --> 01:24.223
Someone's asleep in the on-call room.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.627
- Wake him up.
- I can't leave the desk.

01:26.834 --> 01:29.997
- Then find somebody who can.
- We've got work to do.

01:34.409 --> 01:35.603
Mark!

01:35.810 --> 01:38.040
- Time to get up.
- I'll be right there.

01:43.685 --> 01:46.711
- Mark, let's go! It's 7:00!
- I'm up. I'm up.

01:50.224 --> 01:52.988
I don't want to have
to throw cold water on you.

01:53.194 --> 01:54.456
Doug, is that you?

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.508 --> 02:09.840
Ninety-nine, you idiot!

02:10.044 --> 02:13.343
Two mgs of Ativan, this guy's
out colder than the top of K2.

02:13.548 --> 02:14.981
- Sorry we woke you.
- I'm not.

02:15.183 --> 02:18.983
My shift's over in 10 minutes.
I would've slept through getting off.

02:19.187 --> 02:21.655
Sweet dreams, Bottle Man.

02:27.795 --> 02:30.355
- Hey. You about ready?
- Yeah, I'm about deaf.

02:30.565 --> 02:31.691
It wasn't necessary.

02:31.899 --> 02:33.992
But I do it to Carol every morning.

02:34.202 --> 02:37.035
There's coffee on the stove,
toast on the counter.

02:37.238 --> 02:39.263
Thanks for hosting me an extra night.

02:39.474 --> 02:41.533
We're gonna miss you, eventually.

02:41.743 --> 02:45.042
Who would've thought asbestos
would take so long to get out?

02:45.246 --> 02:47.942
Probably the asbestos guys.
But who's counting?

02:48.149 --> 02:51.175
Now, listen, it's just gonna be,
you know, a few days.

02:51.386 --> 02:53.115
Early next week or something.

02:53.321 --> 02:56.347
- We have any half-and-half?
- Top shelf, to the left.

02:58.926 --> 02:59.915
What?

03:00.595 --> 03:02.927
He didn't mention anything
about his date.

03:03.131 --> 03:04.655
It's none of our business.

03:04.866 --> 03:06.800
- You're not gonna ask?
- No.

03:07.001 --> 03:08.866
And neither are you. Right?

03:09.070 --> 03:11.061
Hey, no.

03:11.406 --> 03:12.532
Right?

03:22.683 --> 03:24.617
This boy is a real annoyance.

03:24.819 --> 03:27.379
- He's a menace.
- He's a machine.

03:27.588 --> 03:31.854
And with four more mgs of Ativan,
he is officially Chicago in January.

03:32.060 --> 03:35.496
I'm out of here. Need anything more?
Call somebody else.

03:36.397 --> 03:38.262
Call someone else.

03:42.470 --> 03:43.698
Carter!

03:44.005 --> 03:48.271
I am not your mother!
Now, for the last time, get up!

03:48.476 --> 03:51.445
Why does she have to do that?

03:51.913 --> 03:53.881
You set the alarm, didn't you?

03:54.682 --> 03:55.671
Roxanne?

03:55.883 --> 03:57.407
Carter!

03:58.219 --> 04:00.551
Yeah, I'm up! Thank you!

04:03.124 --> 04:06.093
Date? It wasn't a date.
What are you talking about?

04:06.294 --> 04:08.455
- You went out with her.
- We had dinner.

04:08.663 --> 04:11.530
She started two days ago.
I was just being nice.

04:11.732 --> 04:14.030
- So it was like a mercy date?
- Of course not.

04:14.235 --> 04:15.930
It was like an introduction.

04:16.137 --> 04:17.125
Orientation.

04:17.338 --> 04:19.966
- Exactly. Thank you, Carol.
- Date.

04:20.173 --> 04:21.971
We didn't go to bed together.

04:22.176 --> 04:26.738
I know, but I was up late helping
Kerry with her portfolio. I'm sorry.

04:26.948 --> 04:28.643
I'd prefer you wake me up.

04:28.850 --> 04:31.045
You want to get up
to check the Nikkei?

04:31.252 --> 04:34.278
- Sorry. My battery's dead.
- No, I am. My car's dead.

04:34.489 --> 04:36.081
We could hoof it to the EI.

04:36.290 --> 04:40.021
What would you think of decreasing
my position in Small Caps...

04:40.228 --> 04:42.492
...by 7% and putting it into Value?

04:42.697 --> 04:45.495
But you need to pull back
your international equities.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.292
I don't want emerging markets.

04:47.502 --> 04:50.062
But you want bonds
and an absolute return fund...

04:50.271 --> 04:52.603
...with a low correlation
to the equity market.

04:52.807 --> 04:54.434
I got a call. You need help?

04:54.642 --> 04:56.269
- False alarm.
- We fixed him up.

04:56.477 --> 04:57.671
Jerry helped too.

04:57.879 --> 05:00.404
Oh, Jerry, the desk clerk.

05:00.615 --> 05:02.947
I'm slowly getting
everyone's name down.

05:03.151 --> 05:05.551
It's great how you solve
problems on your own.

05:05.753 --> 05:07.152
- We do try.
- How are you?

05:07.355 --> 05:10.324
- Getting settled in?
- Everyone's been really helpful.

05:10.525 --> 05:13.688
Oh, by the way,
good job on that drunk.

06:19.860 --> 06:21.987
Mark. Kerry. Do you have a minute?

06:22.196 --> 06:23.185
- Sure.
- Of course.

06:23.397 --> 06:25.957
- It feels like snow today, doesn't it?
- Maybe.

06:26.167 --> 06:30.069
- Mark, thanks again for dinner.
- You're welcome. Just filling her in.

06:30.271 --> 06:32.501
- Yeah, lay of the land thing?
- Orientation.

06:32.707 --> 06:34.436
- John, you have a minute?
- Sure.

06:34.642 --> 06:37.839
Don Anspaugh says it's
the hospital's 100th anniversary.

06:38.045 --> 06:40.980
There's some kind of big
gala dinner Saturday night.

06:41.182 --> 06:43.673
And a little publicity
for Mrs. Ruth Johnson...

06:43.884 --> 06:46.478
...born in this hospital
100 years ago today.

06:46.687 --> 06:49.554
- What's that have to do with the ER?
- Nothing.

06:49.757 --> 06:53.090
Except that Mrs. Johnson
and family are upstairs right now.

06:53.294 --> 06:54.727
Some mix-up on the time.

06:54.929 --> 06:57.989
The <i>Trib's</i> photographer
can't come till this afternoon.

06:58.199 --> 07:01.100
Dr. Anspaugh would like
a tour guide to occupy them.

07:01.302 --> 07:04.169
- They should call Willard Scott.
- I suggested you.

07:04.372 --> 07:06.272
- What?
- Yep. You're the guy.

07:06.474 --> 07:08.999
Friendly, knowledgeable,
know your way around.

07:09.210 --> 07:10.871
I have a med student. Lucy...

07:11.078 --> 07:14.912
She's working with Dr. Ross today.
I can't think of a better choice.

07:15.116 --> 07:17.949
- I think my colleagues agree.
- Dr. Greene, Radiology.

07:18.152 --> 07:21.087
I'll be right there.
You could use a light day.

07:21.289 --> 07:24.281
You're not up to speed
with your shoulder yet, right?

07:24.492 --> 07:29.020
- I'll just finish this paperwork.
- Thanks. I appreciate it. Thanks.

07:29.497 --> 07:32.557
She has a big wind-up
then she nails it over the plate.

07:32.767 --> 07:33.859
I can deal with that.

07:34.068 --> 07:38.004
Jimmy's got an earache and Erlene
has a funny-Iooking sore on her lip.

07:38.205 --> 07:40.901
We'll check them out.
Lucy, start with Jimmy.

07:41.108 --> 07:44.475
We've got an 8-year-old coming in.
Auto versus bicycle.

07:44.679 --> 07:46.510
Lucy, you got this under control?

07:46.714 --> 07:47.976
- No problem.
- All right.

07:48.182 --> 07:50.013
Get away! I don't like that!

07:50.217 --> 07:52.276
- You stop that now!
- I won't hurt you.

07:52.486 --> 07:53.976
I don't want her doing that.

07:54.188 --> 07:56.053
Do you want me to hold him down?

07:56.257 --> 07:57.884
It's okay. A nurse will come.

07:58.092 --> 08:01.027
- Get off me, Mom!
- Okay, we're ready for you.

08:01.228 --> 08:02.718
- Stop it now!
- Get off me!

08:02.930 --> 08:05.728
Wilson Geary, 8.
On his bike, hit by a car.

08:05.933 --> 08:08.094
He was chasing us.
I didn't see the car.

08:08.302 --> 08:11.032
It's okay, Wilson.
We're gonna take care of you.

08:11.238 --> 08:14.765
Good vitals, no LOC, complains
of belly pain, lots of road rash.

08:14.975 --> 08:16.943
Possible fracture on the left hand.

08:17.144 --> 08:20.944
Let's get that buckle.
On my count. One, two, three.

08:21.349 --> 08:23.909
I didn't see what happened to Andy.
I ran away.

08:24.118 --> 08:26.382
He keeps talking about
a guy chasing him.

08:26.587 --> 08:28.782
BP, 120/72. Pulse, 94.

08:28.989 --> 08:33.551
We're gonna cut your clothes so we can
see where you're hurt, all right?

08:33.828 --> 08:37.058
Cops are taking the driver's report.
They'll be in soon.

08:37.264 --> 08:39.630
Thank you.
You remember what happened?

08:39.833 --> 08:42.996
I crossed the park,
then there was a car in the street.

08:43.437 --> 08:45.962
I know to look both ways,
but I was escaping.

08:46.173 --> 08:48.835
- From who?
- This man was chasing me and Andy.

08:49.043 --> 08:51.944
- Good breath sounds. Trachea midline?
- Pulse ox is 98.

08:52.146 --> 08:53.579
- Does it hurt here?
- No.

08:53.781 --> 08:55.772
- How about here?
- That hurts a lot!

08:55.983 --> 08:58.451
Right upper quadrant
tenderness with guarding.

08:58.652 --> 09:03.282
- Get an abdominal CT with contrast.
- Hemoglobin is 13.8.

09:03.491 --> 09:05.220
Sorry, was I tugging too hard?

09:05.426 --> 09:08.691
Got another kid coming in.
8-year-old, GSW to the abdomen.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.591
What did she say? Andy?

09:10.798 --> 09:14.928
Buddy, why don't you just hold still?
Let's worry about you first, okay?

09:15.136 --> 09:18.731
- Don't move your head.
- Just hang in. You're doing great.

09:25.246 --> 09:26.304
Hey.

09:26.881 --> 09:28.041
Hi.

09:28.649 --> 09:31.015
Pre-op labs are back
on the gallbladder.

09:31.218 --> 09:33.448
Lap choly's scheduled
for this afternoon.

09:33.654 --> 09:35.815
No films for the ischemic bowel yet.

09:36.023 --> 09:40.221
And the aortobifemoral bypass went
south with pneumonia 10 days post-op.

09:40.428 --> 09:42.953
Yeah, I know. I spoke to the family.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.866
What's this?
You prepping for the M and M?

09:49.069 --> 09:52.732
Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox,
time of magnesium injection...

09:52.940 --> 09:55.067
...central line placed,
pacemaker captured.

09:55.276 --> 09:57.972
After seeing your M and M
on Dr. Swanson last year...

09:58.179 --> 10:00.272
...I thought it best
to be well-prepared.

10:00.481 --> 10:03.041
- I doubt it'll go like that.
- So do I, but...

10:03.250 --> 10:05.980
- You know, l...
- Dr. Benton, Dr. Kotlowitz wants you.

10:06.187 --> 10:09.918
- The Shimaharas are here.
- Oh, damn! Okay.

10:10.257 --> 10:11.918
I'll be right there, Shirley.

10:13.260 --> 10:17.356
He's putting a cochlear implant into a
3-year-old. I gotta go and observe.

10:17.698 --> 10:20.667
- I've never seen one.
- Yeah. Neither have I.

10:23.904 --> 10:26.464
If you need someone
to bounce that stuff off of...

10:26.674 --> 10:30.110
Oh, Peter, go. I'm busy.
And you've got work to do as well.

10:32.012 --> 10:33.775
I'll be there, Elizabeth.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.312
I know you will.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.880
Thanks.

10:38.252 --> 10:39.082
<i>One, two, three.</i>

10:39.286 --> 10:43.347
GSW to the abdomen. Found pulseless
and apneic. Asystole on the monitor.

10:43.557 --> 10:46.526
Had two rounds of epi and atropine.
A liter of saline in.

10:46.727 --> 10:48.558
- What's the downtime?
- 30 minutes.

10:48.762 --> 10:50.696
I told the cops to wait outside.

10:51.765 --> 10:54.199
Thoracotomy tray.
O-neg on the rapid infuser.

10:54.401 --> 10:57.097
- I'll do a cutdown. Last epi?
- Five minutes ago.

10:57.304 --> 10:59.772
- Go high-dose, three mgs.
- Need anything else?

10:59.974 --> 11:00.963
No, we got it.

11:01.175 --> 11:02.267
Come on.

11:03.210 --> 11:05.110
Hey, Pam. Did you get a name?

11:05.312 --> 11:08.179
- Unconscious from the get-go.
- Okay, thanks.

11:08.382 --> 11:11.374
Excuse me, nurse?
Is that the kid hit by the car?

11:11.585 --> 11:13.450
Wilson Geary? I need to see him.

11:13.888 --> 11:15.253
Not now. What happened?

11:15.456 --> 11:18.687
Not sure. Responded to the accident.
He was pretty shaken.

11:18.893 --> 11:21.361
Paramedics took him,
then we found the GSW.

11:21.562 --> 11:24.554
- Did you get a name?
- Yeah. I got this.

11:25.432 --> 11:27.024
Contacted his parents.

11:27.334 --> 11:30.269
- And what about Wilson's family?
- Working on it.

11:31.171 --> 11:32.661
- Thanks.
- Sure.

11:33.774 --> 11:35.173
- Andy!
- Buddy, hey.

11:35.376 --> 11:37.435
You gotta look at me right now, okay?

11:37.645 --> 11:39.636
We're gonna fix you up first.

11:39.847 --> 11:40.939
Okay.

11:41.148 --> 11:42.376
Doing a thoracotomy.

11:42.583 --> 11:43.982
- Asystole?
- 30 minutes.

11:44.184 --> 11:45.242
- You got this?
- Yeah.

11:45.452 --> 11:48.285
All right, Wilson.
Be back in a little bit.

11:48.522 --> 11:49.682
Okay.

11:50.257 --> 11:52.987
- What are they doing?
- They're trying to help him.

11:53.193 --> 11:55.684
You mean cutting
his clothes off and stuff?

11:55.896 --> 11:57.227
Yeah, that's right.

11:57.865 --> 11:59.127
Ready to go for a ride?

11:59.333 --> 12:02.530
We're going down the hall
to take a picture of your belly.

12:03.404 --> 12:05.668
- Dr. Anspaugh's not here.
- That's a lie.

12:05.873 --> 12:07.966
- He's on the schedule.
- He can't see you.

12:08.175 --> 12:10.769
- I need a minute.
- In the middle of a Whipple?

12:10.978 --> 12:14.470
Carter, be a good soldier.
They're thataway.

12:31.231 --> 12:34.200
Hi. I'm looking for Ruth Johnson.

12:34.401 --> 12:38.394
Are you the doc? I've got a mole
right here, back of my neck...

12:38.606 --> 12:42.303
Edgar! Stop your mole talk!

12:43.677 --> 12:44.905
I'm Ruth Johnson.

12:45.245 --> 12:48.112
Gilda here had to use the bathroom.

12:48.315 --> 12:52.411
And you know how the young ones
like someone to take them.

12:52.620 --> 12:54.747
Nana, please. Hi, I'm Gilda Bernucci.

12:54.955 --> 12:57.890
Married an Italian.
Guess we all know what that means.

12:58.092 --> 12:59.320
Nana, please.

12:59.526 --> 13:01.551
Are you the ambassador?

13:01.762 --> 13:02.751
I guess so.

13:02.963 --> 13:06.160
As you see, I don't need that thing.

13:06.367 --> 13:10.030
But it seems to make
everyone else happy.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.267
Feels good anyway.

13:16.477 --> 13:19.810
- Are you in?
- Yeah. Just a minute.

13:20.014 --> 13:22.414
Okay, then. Let's take a tour.

13:22.616 --> 13:25.744
Can you page Dr. Ross when
Wilson Geary's films get back?

13:25.953 --> 13:27.443
- You got it.
- Thanks.

13:27.655 --> 13:29.213
- Anyone talk to him?
- Excuse me.

13:29.423 --> 13:32.449
- Andy Stiles' parents are here.
- I'll get Dr. Weaver.

13:32.660 --> 13:35.595
It's his mom and her boyfriend.
Parents are divorced.

13:35.796 --> 13:38.264
- And Wilson's family?
- Business trip in Dallas.

13:38.465 --> 13:39.454
We're looking.

13:39.667 --> 13:42.830
He was staying at Andy's house.
Thanks for your help.

13:43.037 --> 13:46.302
Hey, Kerry?
Andy's mother is waiting in Chairs.

13:46.507 --> 13:49.442
I'll talk to her.
Malik, she might want to come back.

13:49.643 --> 13:51.042
I'll clean him up.

13:51.311 --> 13:54.280
- How's the other boy?
- Not sure. He's just back from CT.

13:54.481 --> 13:57.245
- Has anyone talked to him yet?
- Family's out of town.

13:57.451 --> 13:59.942
- Lf Doug's busy, let me know.
- Thanks.

14:15.135 --> 14:16.500
Hey, Wilson.

14:17.271 --> 14:18.465
How're you doing?

14:18.672 --> 14:20.003
Okay.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.539
Hey, Andy can have that bed there.

14:24.712 --> 14:26.509
How did you like the CT?

14:26.780 --> 14:28.441
It was no big deal.

14:32.553 --> 14:35.351
I have some extra time.
I thought we could talk.

14:36.090 --> 14:37.352
Okay.

14:37.758 --> 14:39.020
Okay.

14:47.334 --> 14:48.699
- Don't ask.
- I won't.

14:48.902 --> 14:51.336
But it's the highlight of my day.

14:51.805 --> 14:53.773
I'll wait for another elevator.

14:53.974 --> 14:54.941
Good idea.

15:00.147 --> 15:01.136
Lizzie!

15:03.016 --> 15:06.315
Glad to see you're in good spirits
on your day of reckoning.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.717
- Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.
- You've got me on your side.

15:09.923 --> 15:13.154
It's not a matter of sides,
but an examination of the event.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.828
That's just the attitude
to go in with.

15:16.830 --> 15:20.527
In case we don't see each other
again before the conference...

15:20.734 --> 15:21.792
Well...

15:31.845 --> 15:33.278
Best of luck.

15:36.984 --> 15:39.851
- Fracture to the fourth mid-phalanx.
- I splinted it.

15:40.053 --> 15:43.648
- Any word from the parents?
- They're on their way from Dallas.

15:43.857 --> 15:47.588
Broken finger and some road rash.
All things considered, he's lucky.

15:47.795 --> 15:50.093
- Not really.
- That's pretty funny, isn't it?

15:50.297 --> 15:52.424
It's kind of amazing, really.

15:52.933 --> 15:54.696
Hi. I'm Carol Hathaway.

15:54.902 --> 15:56.767
Detective Wilson, Chicago PD.

15:56.970 --> 16:00.872
Wilson and I were just laughing
about how we both have the same name.

16:01.074 --> 16:02.507
That doesn't happen often.

16:02.709 --> 16:04.734
It's not the same.
It's my first name.

16:04.945 --> 16:08.176
Right. Look, I need to ask you
a few questions, Wilson.

16:08.382 --> 16:12.011
- She doesn't have to leave, does she?
- Nope. I'm staying right here.

16:12.853 --> 16:15.981
I'd like you to tell me
about what happened in the park.

16:16.190 --> 16:18.351
Someone hurt your friend Andy, right?

16:18.559 --> 16:20.117
She said Andy was dead.

16:20.961 --> 16:22.622
Yeah, Wilson. He is dead.

16:23.730 --> 16:27.461
And you saw the man who was
chasing him? Chasing you?

16:30.137 --> 16:32.105
Can you tell me if he was...

16:32.306 --> 16:36.868
...white, or black,
Latino, or maybe Asian?

16:37.411 --> 16:39.504
- Do you know what those mean?
- Yeah.

16:40.614 --> 16:42.047
So which one was he?

16:47.554 --> 16:49.044
Did you know this man?

16:49.523 --> 16:52.686
You recognize him? Maybe you
saw him in the park before?

16:52.960 --> 16:55.656
The police just want to find
the man who did this.

16:55.863 --> 16:58.457
So anything you tell them can help.

16:58.999 --> 17:00.398
I don't know.

17:01.635 --> 17:03.933
Well, was he a tall guy
or a short guy?

17:05.105 --> 17:06.538
Kind of tall, maybe.

17:08.541 --> 17:12.342
Did he come up on you all of a sudden
or did you notice him earlier?

17:12.613 --> 17:16.013
He came up all of a sudden.
When are my mom and dad coming?

17:16.349 --> 17:19.046
- You said they were coming.
- They're on their way.

17:19.252 --> 17:21.243
They'll be here as soon as they can.

17:25.992 --> 17:28.791
You haven't gotten off
the surgical floor yet?

17:29.363 --> 17:31.558
We're back on the surgical floor.

17:31.765 --> 17:33.164
It's their favorite.

17:33.367 --> 17:35.961
They'd like to observe
an operation, if possible.

17:36.169 --> 17:38.865
- Something in the open-heart variety.
- Settle down.

17:39.072 --> 17:42.530
This won't kill you. Is she...

17:42.743 --> 17:45.303
...you know, pretty well out of it?

17:45.512 --> 17:49.312
No, not at all. She just has
a tendency to doze off...

17:49.516 --> 17:50.881
...unannounced.

17:51.084 --> 17:52.073
Right.

17:52.286 --> 17:54.220
Well, carry on.

17:55.555 --> 17:57.216
I'm awake.

17:58.558 --> 18:01.584
Just playing possum.
I'm sick of meeting people.

18:01.895 --> 18:04.227
Can we get out of here?

18:04.731 --> 18:09.600
- I don't know where we'd all fit.
- Oh, not them. Us.

18:09.803 --> 18:12.533
Once the implant's in,
we'll repair the pericranium.

18:12.739 --> 18:15.640
After his hair grows,
you'd never know we were there.

18:15.842 --> 18:17.366
Except he'll be able to hear.

18:17.577 --> 18:20.137
We'll activate the device
in a few months.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.107
If you'll excuse me a minute...

18:23.717 --> 18:24.945
He seems excellent.

18:25.152 --> 18:28.588
Oh, yeah. He's terrific.
He's very aggressive.

18:28.789 --> 18:29.778
Aggressive?

18:30.457 --> 18:33.426
Well, I mean, as in "accomplished."

18:34.728 --> 18:37.959
So I guess you guys tried
every other option for Patrick?

18:38.165 --> 18:41.965
We've done the hearing aids, intensive
oral training, speech training...

18:42.169 --> 18:44.933
...Iooked into special teachers,
special schools.

18:45.272 --> 18:48.799
- We know this isn't a cure.
- No, no. But, man!

18:49.142 --> 18:50.837
He'll hear a range of sounds.

18:51.044 --> 18:52.375
Mr. And Mrs. Shimahara?

18:52.579 --> 18:54.513
Hi. Here you go.

18:54.715 --> 18:57.707
We'll take him to pre-op in a bit.
But in the meantime...

18:57.918 --> 18:59.215
I'll see you.

18:59.419 --> 19:01.887
- There's my boy.
- Hey, Patrick! Hey, big guy!

19:05.726 --> 19:07.887
Is this okay? You're not too cold?

19:08.095 --> 19:09.858
Not too cold.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.397
This is a bit better view, I think.

19:12.833 --> 19:16.132
At my age, anything vertical
will do just fine.

19:16.436 --> 19:19.234
So how does it feel
to have 100 birthdays?

19:19.773 --> 19:21.297
Downright appalling.

19:24.211 --> 19:28.614
I'm so old I can practically remember
when this river ran the other way.

19:28.815 --> 19:31.648
That's right!
That's right, they changed it.

19:31.852 --> 19:34.252
My husband, Everett,
used to love this river...

19:34.621 --> 19:38.887
...staring down at it
from 20 stories high.

19:39.126 --> 19:41.390
He worked in one of
these buildings here?

19:41.595 --> 19:42.619
Built them.

19:43.663 --> 19:46.427
Construction spree
after the First War.

19:46.633 --> 19:49.534
Even worked on the
Chicago Board of Trade Building.

19:49.736 --> 19:50.725
We did real well.

19:50.937 --> 19:54.236
Sent every child to college
whether they wanted to go or not.

19:54.441 --> 19:57.535
They must have appreciated it.
They seem pretty devoted.

19:58.445 --> 19:59.537
Family should be.

20:00.814 --> 20:02.839
Some are more than others.

20:04.151 --> 20:06.176
My mom and dad, they...

20:07.087 --> 20:08.577
They tend to travel a lot.

20:08.789 --> 20:11.053
Oh, don't tell me your sad tale.

20:11.458 --> 20:14.621
I hear enough of that at Happy Valley.

20:15.062 --> 20:19.931
"My kids hate me. I hate my kids.
My son never visits me." On and on.

20:21.201 --> 20:23.465
Given that you never know
what you'll get...

20:23.670 --> 20:27.697
...Everett and I were darn lucky
in what we begot.

20:30.143 --> 20:33.271
Well, I suppose
we should be heading back.

20:33.947 --> 20:38.509
They're all terrified I'm gonna die
before they get this picture taken.

20:38.718 --> 20:39.776
Okay.

20:41.054 --> 20:42.043
Doug?

20:42.255 --> 20:44.746
Andy Stiles' mom
and her boyfriend are here.

20:44.958 --> 20:47.950
- Are you the ones who helped Wilson?
- Yeah.

20:48.562 --> 20:51.690
I'm Judy Stiles, Andy's mother.

20:52.666 --> 20:54.531
This is Carl Dayton.

20:55.135 --> 20:56.124
We're very sorry.

20:56.636 --> 20:59.070
It's taking so long
to make the arrangements.

20:59.272 --> 21:02.105
- We want to see Wilson.
- He could use a familiar face.

21:02.309 --> 21:04.607
- He's sleeping.
- We want to see how he is.

21:04.811 --> 21:07.780
- And we want to talk to him.
- He hasn't said very much.

21:07.981 --> 21:10.848
- The police were here earlier.
- What did he tell them?

21:11.051 --> 21:14.020
- He couldn't remember anything.
- Please.

21:14.488 --> 21:17.116
He was the last person
to see my son.

21:18.825 --> 21:21.191
- All right.
- Okay. For a few minutes.

21:21.394 --> 21:22.554
All right.

21:29.369 --> 21:30.336
Hey.

21:30.570 --> 21:31.559
Wilson?

21:31.771 --> 21:34.604
Wilson? Some people who
know you want to see you.

21:34.808 --> 21:36.776
- What?
- Hi, Wilson.

21:37.677 --> 21:38.666
How you doing?

21:38.879 --> 21:41.143
I don't remember what happened.

21:41.581 --> 21:43.378
I know. That's okay, sweetie.

21:43.583 --> 21:45.346
- You boys skip school again?
- Carl.

21:45.552 --> 21:47.144
- Always in trouble...
- Not now.

21:47.354 --> 21:50.812
- How many times I gotta warn you?
- You won't have to do it again!

21:52.292 --> 21:56.126
I'm sorry. We shouldn't have skipped.
I'm really sorry.

22:00.901 --> 22:02.129
I think we need to go.

22:02.402 --> 22:03.994
All right.

22:06.106 --> 22:09.132
Your mom and your dad
are gonna be here real soon.

22:09.543 --> 22:11.568
I know you're gonna be just fine.

22:11.978 --> 22:14.640
Hey. It's okay, Wilson.

22:14.848 --> 22:16.247
It's okay.

22:24.291 --> 22:26.555
Patients always postpone
before holidays.

22:26.760 --> 22:30.491
Nothing like surgery to make
fruitcake seem like a good idea.

22:30.697 --> 22:33.757
- Yeah. Right.
- So I can fit in Reece next Tuesday.

22:33.967 --> 22:36.561
But his age doesn't fit
the FDA requirements.

22:36.770 --> 22:38.499
It's been lowered to 18 months.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.764
But his residual hearing
is still high.

22:40.974 --> 22:45.240
He's right on the bubble. Here's
the thing: We know it won't improve.

22:45.445 --> 22:48.846
The sooner he can orient himself
to a hearing world, the better.

22:49.049 --> 22:50.448
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah. Right.

22:50.650 --> 22:53.585
So, Vicky, let's put
Reece Benton on my schedule...

22:53.787 --> 22:56.756
...for a cochlear implant,
next Tuesday a.m.

22:56.957 --> 22:57.946
Good.

22:58.792 --> 23:01.625
Good. How we doing?
Peter, you know Alex Babcock?

23:01.828 --> 23:03.762
- Anesthesiologist.
- Good to see you.

23:03.964 --> 23:06.228
- How'd we do?
- Kid sailed through pre-op.

23:06.433 --> 23:10.164
Fentanyl oralet, a little Versed,
paralyzed and intubated.

23:10.370 --> 23:13.931
- How did the parents do?
- They could've used some lollipops.

23:14.374 --> 23:18.606
Okay, Peter. So I'm going
to implant the electrode...

23:18.812 --> 23:21.076
...directly out
of the linea temporalis.

23:21.281 --> 23:25.581
Then I'm going to put the microphone
holder right behind the ear.

23:25.785 --> 23:27.753
I'm gonna inject lidocaine.

23:27.954 --> 23:32.050
And I'm going to make
a flap, two centimeters...

23:32.259 --> 23:35.194
...from where I insert the device.

23:35.395 --> 23:37.727
I'll cut through the muscle
and pericranium...

23:37.931 --> 23:40.798
...so the flap will come
right off the skull.

23:41.301 --> 23:42.996
Alex, going to Aspen this year?

23:43.203 --> 23:47.139
No, too many snowboarders. Felt
like I was part of an obstacle course.

23:48.308 --> 23:51.004
- Peter, can you see all right?
- Yeah.

23:51.378 --> 23:53.403
Don't want you to miss anything here.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.507
There we go.

24:05.659 --> 24:07.786
Hey. What are you doing out of bed?

24:07.994 --> 24:10.155
- Looking for the bathroom.
- I'll take you.

24:10.363 --> 24:11.853
No, I found it.

24:12.532 --> 24:14.557
Then I'll take you to your bed.

24:15.735 --> 24:18.329
You're looking better.
Are you feeling better?

24:21.775 --> 24:25.541
Wilson, what is it?
Is something wrong?

24:25.945 --> 24:28.072
I should have told the policeman.

24:28.281 --> 24:30.715
They're gonna keep asking me,
aren't they?

24:34.087 --> 24:36.555
Well, they want to find out
who did this.

24:36.990 --> 24:40.187
If you remembered anything,
I can get the detective.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.055
No.

24:43.096 --> 24:46.088
When you came here, you said
there was a man chasing you.

24:46.566 --> 24:50.525
He was white. He seemed tall.
But I got on my bike right away.

24:51.037 --> 24:54.006
Did you know this man?
Have you seen him before?

24:55.075 --> 24:56.633
We'd seen him there earlier.

24:56.843 --> 25:00.370
And we'd seen him before
in the park when we'd play.

25:00.613 --> 25:03.946
And if you saw this man again,
would you recognize him?

25:04.551 --> 25:06.348
I don't know. Maybe.

25:06.753 --> 25:09.313
Do I have to talk
to the policeman again?

25:09.522 --> 25:12.958
- When are my mom and dad coming?
- Don't worry. They'll be here.

25:13.193 --> 25:16.219
Carol, the cops had to leave
but they'll be back soon.

25:16.429 --> 25:19.762
- They said your bike's at the station.
- Thanks, Jeanie.

25:19.966 --> 25:23.732
- Are you sure it was this room?
- No. But I was in here earlier.

25:24.104 --> 25:27.471
As I said, it's a randomized
double-blind multi-center study...

25:27.674 --> 25:30.336
...funded by one of those
hoo-hah biotech companies.

25:30.543 --> 25:32.909
And the drug is for treating
fracture pain?

25:33.113 --> 25:35.809
Comparing it against
acetaminophen with codeine.

25:36.015 --> 25:39.280
Hopefully, it'll be more
effective with fewer side effects.

25:39.486 --> 25:42.080
A colleague is coordinating
it from Atlanta.

25:42.288 --> 25:45.280
So you want me to conduct
a study at County General.

25:45.492 --> 25:49.451
Kerry's doing the sternal saw study.
I thought you might want this one.

25:49.662 --> 25:52.825
- Lf you're game.
- I'm game. Why not?

25:53.199 --> 25:54.996
Hey, doc. Need some help?

25:55.435 --> 25:58.871
I was just helping Dr. Lee.
We're trying to find her earring.

25:59.072 --> 26:02.872
You know, that's okay. I'm gonna
check the desk. Thanks, Mark.

26:03.643 --> 26:04.837
That's a nurse's job.

26:05.044 --> 26:08.411
They were busy replenishing albuterol
and mixing ipratropium.

26:08.615 --> 26:11.175
I was trying to help
in an emergent situation.

26:11.384 --> 26:13.648
- Who injected the magnesium?
- I did.

26:13.853 --> 26:16.583
Did you verify the dosage
with the nursing staff?

26:16.790 --> 26:18.621
When did you realize your mistake?

26:18.825 --> 26:21.555
The patient went
into respiratory arrest at 1534...

26:21.761 --> 26:24.787
...fourteen minutes
into the magnesium injection.

26:25.198 --> 26:27.098
Continue, Dr. Corday.

26:27.333 --> 26:30.996
Endotracheal intubation was performed.
Heart rate dropped to 30.

26:31.204 --> 26:33.832
The patient received
IV calcium and atropine.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.942
A transvenous pacing wire was placed,
captured at 1556 hours.

26:38.144 --> 26:40.510
- Who was Supervising Resident?
- Dr. Benton.

26:40.713 --> 26:42.180
Who left you unsupervised.

26:42.382 --> 26:45.681
She had the patient intubated
and on a transvenous pacemaker.

26:45.885 --> 26:48.615
Due to her quick response,
the patient recovered...

26:48.822 --> 26:51.188
...with no cardiac
or neurological sequelae.

26:51.391 --> 26:54.224
It's important that we look
at the outcome here.

26:54.427 --> 26:58.659
Thank you, but I'm not looking
to you for defense of my actions.

26:58.865 --> 27:02.164
In fact, I feel
that M and M has become...

27:02.368 --> 27:04.734
...a forum to place blame...

27:04.938 --> 27:09.068
...cover up mistakes, or be grateful
that there's not a lawsuit.

27:10.443 --> 27:13.742
I would argue that, actually,
we should embrace our mistakes...

27:13.947 --> 27:17.144
...and learn from them
to improve the system.

27:17.350 --> 27:20.444
I erred not because I was
untrained or incompetent...

27:20.653 --> 27:25.420
...but because I was exhausted,
having been up for 36 hours.

27:25.925 --> 27:29.019
If we really want to cut down
on our errors...

27:29.229 --> 27:32.562
...why don't we, for example,
allow on-call house officers...

27:32.765 --> 27:35.791
...to leave by 12 noon
on the post-call day?

27:36.002 --> 27:38.869
Why don't we establish
a night float system?

27:39.606 --> 27:43.440
Air traffic controllers work with
airplanes four to six hours a day...

27:43.643 --> 27:46.908
...no more than two hours
without a break. Now, why?

27:47.113 --> 27:49.047
Because human life is at stake.

27:49.249 --> 27:54.277
Yet we allow surgical interns
to work 36 hours without sleep.

27:54.487 --> 27:55.476
Why?

27:56.022 --> 27:58.047
Because we've all had to do it?

27:58.258 --> 28:01.284
Because the surgeons before us
have had to do it?

28:01.561 --> 28:03.654
Tradition may be
wonderfully nostalgic...

28:03.863 --> 28:07.697
...but it is clearly not
in the best interests of our patients.

28:07.901 --> 28:12.497
If you disagree with me, why don't you
ask yourself next time you fly:

28:12.705 --> 28:15.265
Do you really want that man
in the control room...

28:15.475 --> 28:18.239
...to be on his 36th hour?

28:23.416 --> 28:25.179
She's full of piss and vinegar.

28:25.385 --> 28:27.785
- For an old lady.
- Because she's an old lady.

28:27.987 --> 28:30.114
Everybody look at the camera lens.

28:30.323 --> 28:33.759
If you're looking at the camera lens,
you're in the picture.

28:33.993 --> 28:35.756
And smile.

28:36.329 --> 28:40.425
I just need Mrs. Johnson's
children inside for a quick picture.

28:43.703 --> 28:45.500
She's done it again.

28:46.673 --> 28:48.163
Mrs. Johnson?

28:51.678 --> 28:54.476
Mrs. Johnson, are you
playing possum again?

28:56.115 --> 28:58.606
Come on, Ruth. Time to wake up now.

29:00.119 --> 29:01.313
Ruth?

29:02.722 --> 29:04.212
Mrs. Johnson?

29:06.059 --> 29:09.324
Oh, God! Kit, go get a gurney
and a crash cart now.

29:11.898 --> 29:13.331
I don't want to bother you...

29:13.533 --> 29:15.933
...but the boys' clothes
are all mixed up.

29:16.169 --> 29:18.899
Andy's... His boots are missing.

29:19.105 --> 29:20.868
And I've got Wilson's sneakers.

29:21.074 --> 29:25.010
I'm so sorry. If you'll just have
a seat, I'll go check for you.

29:28.314 --> 29:30.282
Have you seen Wilson's belongings?

29:30.483 --> 29:32.678
Maybe check under the trauma gurney.

30:20.633 --> 30:23.932
Conni, I need to talk to Wilson.
Can you give us a minute?

30:24.137 --> 30:26.002
- Sure.
- Thanks.

30:32.745 --> 30:34.440
Wilson, wake up.

30:34.881 --> 30:36.439
Hey, Wilson.

30:37.417 --> 30:40.284
- Are my parents here?
- No, not yet.

30:41.487 --> 30:43.421
But I got to thinking.

30:43.623 --> 30:46.057
Andy was probably
your best friend, right?

30:46.259 --> 30:48.056
Sometimes.

30:48.728 --> 30:52.323
When your parents were out of town
on business, you'd stay there?

30:52.532 --> 30:55.592
It was closer to school.
We could ride our bikes.

30:56.169 --> 30:57.898
So you probably...

30:58.304 --> 31:00.465
...shared each other's toys?

31:00.840 --> 31:02.307
Maybe even...

31:03.009 --> 31:06.103
...coats, gloves, boots?

31:06.879 --> 31:09.575
Andy would never let me
wear his boots.

31:09.782 --> 31:11.716
They're kind of too small, anyway.

31:11.984 --> 31:14.544
Remember when you were trying
to take them off?

31:15.054 --> 31:18.490
Right. So if he never
let you wear his boots...

31:18.691 --> 31:22.889
...then how come you were wearing them
when the paramedics brought you here?

31:24.230 --> 31:27.996
- Because we had a bet and I won.
- A bet?

31:28.334 --> 31:32.532
To see who could ride faster from
his house to the park. And I won.

31:33.106 --> 31:35.006
Whoever won got to wear the boots?

31:35.208 --> 31:38.006
Yeah. But he wouldn't
give them to me.

31:38.211 --> 31:41.374
I rode faster and he knew it.
He wasn't being fair.

31:45.384 --> 31:48.478
- Are these yours or Andy's?
- Neither. They're my dad's.

31:50.556 --> 31:52.683
Wilson, did you put these into a gun?

31:53.493 --> 31:56.462
No, those are extras.
I already had some in the gun.

32:00.533 --> 32:04.435
And when Andy didn't
give you the boots...

32:04.637 --> 32:06.332
...you pointed the gun at him?

32:12.345 --> 32:13.505
And you shot him?

32:14.280 --> 32:17.215
Not to hurt him or anything.
Just to scare him.

32:17.650 --> 32:20.847
We had a bet and I won.
It was fair and square.

32:23.790 --> 32:25.257
You do know...

32:25.591 --> 32:27.354
...that you hurt him though, right?

32:28.060 --> 32:30.722
Look, all I meant
was to get the boots.

32:31.097 --> 32:35.591
You can't go back on a bet.
That's not right. Andy knows that.

32:35.935 --> 32:37.562
What did you do with the gun?

32:37.770 --> 32:40.705
I dropped it down a drain pipe
when I got on my bike.

32:40.907 --> 32:43.933
None of this would've happened
if that car hadn't hit me.

32:50.249 --> 32:52.683
You'll let me know
when my parents get here?

32:53.753 --> 32:55.744
Yeah, Wilson. I'll let you know.

32:57.390 --> 32:58.550
Oh, Nurse Hathaway...

33:00.359 --> 33:02.884
...can you not tell my dad
I threw his gun away?

33:03.095 --> 33:04.528
He'll get really mad.

33:10.236 --> 33:14.434
- You're saying he could go home today?
- There are no prisons for 8-year-olds.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.541
I'm not talking prison.
I'm talking juvenile hall.

33:17.743 --> 33:19.506
Not for kids under 10.

33:19.712 --> 33:22.408
Can an 8-year-old
even understand his rights?

33:22.615 --> 33:24.947
- Or the consequences of his actions?
- Yes!

33:25.151 --> 33:27.142
He shot Andy to get the boots.

33:27.353 --> 33:30.516
He wanted to scare the boy.
His intent wasn't to kill.

33:30.723 --> 33:32.315
But he did kill him!

33:32.525 --> 33:34.459
- Doesn't that count?
- Yeah, but what?

33:34.660 --> 33:37.686
Murder two? Manslaughter?
The kid is 8 years old.

33:37.897 --> 33:39.558
Isn't it up to the state?

33:39.999 --> 33:42.968
But he's gotta be assessed
and get a psych evaluation.

33:43.169 --> 33:47.299
Social Services has to see if he can
differentiate between right and wrong.

33:47.506 --> 33:51.237
He can. Why would he make up
a story about the man chasing them?

33:51.444 --> 33:54.777
Is he aware of what he's done?
Has he shown any remorse?

33:54.981 --> 33:56.573
He's sorry he tossed the gun...

33:56.782 --> 34:00.013
...afraid his father will be mad.
Does that count as remorse?

34:00.820 --> 34:05.655
You're telling me the police,
the courts, psych, Social Services...

34:05.858 --> 34:08.224
...nobody knows what to do
with Wilson Geary?

34:08.728 --> 34:10.127
Pretty much.

34:10.529 --> 34:12.053
What a mess!

34:14.433 --> 34:17.094
- Anything else you want me to do?
- Not right now.

34:17.303 --> 34:19.828
- I put her things in here.
- Thanks, Chuny.

34:20.306 --> 34:22.206
I'll go talk to the family.

34:30.882 --> 34:35.717
Apparently, she was sucking on a hard
candy and it lodged in her windpipe.

34:35.922 --> 34:39.755
We were able to extract it,
and her BP is now 128/90.

34:40.126 --> 34:41.388
Heart rate, 70.

34:41.594 --> 34:43.494
Vital signs all appear normal.

34:43.696 --> 34:46.494
- You mean she's not dead?
- No, no. She's not dead.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.996
She's asleep,
but definitely not dead.

34:49.201 --> 34:52.364
- Can we see her?
- Like I said, she's asleep so...

34:55.373 --> 34:56.362
Dr. Lee?

34:56.876 --> 35:00.903
I'm sorry. We looked everywhere,
and we couldn't find your earring.

35:01.113 --> 35:02.512
Well, thank you, anyway.

35:02.715 --> 35:05.309
- Did you lose an earring?
- Yes.

35:05.518 --> 35:09.477
Not expensive or anything.
But sentimental value.

35:10.189 --> 35:12.555
Yes. I was engaged once.

35:12.858 --> 35:14.291
To a really lovely man.

35:14.493 --> 35:18.623
And he was killed in a freak
horseback riding accident.

35:19.966 --> 35:24.062
Actually, we were on a bridge
and the horse spooked and...

35:25.705 --> 35:28.230
- Anyway, he gave them to me.
- I'm so sorry.

35:28.441 --> 35:31.706
Thanks. It was a long time ago.

35:58.004 --> 36:00.029
Yeah. David Kotlowitz, please.

36:00.606 --> 36:01.595
Peter Benton.

36:01.807 --> 36:05.368
Hey, David. Listen, I...

36:05.578 --> 36:08.570
I wanted to postpone
Reece's operation.

36:08.981 --> 36:11.506
I mean, he's barely
within the age range.

36:11.717 --> 36:13.912
He has a fair amount
of residual hearing...

36:14.120 --> 36:16.782
...and the technology's
changing all the time.

36:17.523 --> 36:20.959
Yeah. No, I just saw him.
He's doing fine.

36:23.329 --> 36:26.196
Yeah, well, you too.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.295
Have a great holiday, all right?

36:30.102 --> 36:33.162
My parents called on the way
from the airport.

36:35.241 --> 36:37.573
My dad has a phone in his car.

36:43.649 --> 36:45.810
You're mad at me, aren't you?

36:46.018 --> 36:47.007
No.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.784
When my mom's mad, she stands
at the sink and does dishes.

36:50.990 --> 36:52.890
And she doesn't say anything.

36:53.893 --> 36:57.488
I'm not mad, Wilson.
I'm sad about what happened to Andy.

36:58.531 --> 37:02.023
It would've been so cool
if he was in one of these other beds.

37:03.836 --> 37:06.031
Do you know what it means to be sad?

37:09.275 --> 37:12.642
Wilson, do you know what it means
to have done something wrong?

37:18.751 --> 37:19.911
Carol.

37:20.553 --> 37:22.111
His parents are here.

37:22.321 --> 37:23.686
Thanks, Conni.

37:45.244 --> 37:46.973
Are you waiting on a bus?

37:48.481 --> 37:51.314
I wish I was on a bus going anywhere.

37:52.685 --> 37:56.177
- How'd it go with Anspaugh?
- Well, no crime, no punishment.

37:56.388 --> 37:59.824
Seems what I did wasn't terribly wrong.
No need to penalize me.

38:00.025 --> 38:04.860
No need to examine a system that's
served so many, so well, for so long.

38:05.064 --> 38:08.124
They seemed pretty shocked
that you actually suggested it.

38:09.735 --> 38:11.259
As were you.

38:11.470 --> 38:14.667
Oh, well, it wouldn't
have been my choice.

38:17.176 --> 38:20.270
Well, you and I never make
the same choices, do we?

38:22.515 --> 38:23.504
No.

38:25.584 --> 38:27.984
Well, Peter, we could now.

38:29.255 --> 38:31.348
Come on, Peter. This should be over.

38:31.557 --> 38:35.960
Some would argue that it already is.
We haven't been alone for weeks.

38:37.463 --> 38:39.488
I need to focus on my son right now.

38:39.832 --> 38:42.630
Look, we could both draw up
a list of reasons why.

38:42.835 --> 38:46.032
But why don't we just put it down
to faulty construction?

38:46.305 --> 38:49.934
A casual relationship has to grow
into something or it dies.

38:50.910 --> 38:54.277
It's not like I haven't wanted this
to grow. It's just that I...

38:55.514 --> 38:57.641
I don't have it
to give right now. L...

38:59.852 --> 39:01.547
I understand that.

39:03.289 --> 39:06.224
Which is why I think maybe...

39:07.860 --> 39:10.055
...we'd be better off as friends.

39:17.770 --> 39:19.601
I'll see you around, okay?

39:22.374 --> 39:26.140
You probably didn't know it, but
we've been off work for 20 minutes.

39:26.345 --> 39:29.803
Want to get something to eat?
Rosebud, Morton's, Johnny D's?

39:30.015 --> 39:32.950
- Home, bathtub, bed.
- That's my girl.

39:33.519 --> 39:35.384
I met them today, you know?

39:35.788 --> 39:38.348
They seemed like
perfectly normal people.

39:38.857 --> 39:42.486
Father sells office supplies.
Mother went to Dallas with him.

39:42.695 --> 39:46.358
- She wanted to see her favorite aunt.
- Wilson's parents?

39:46.765 --> 39:49.825
Thought they'd be monsters
to raise a kid like that.

39:50.035 --> 39:52.128
That would explain everything, right?

39:52.338 --> 39:56.297
The parents beat the kid.
Or they yell at him, or starve him.

39:56.508 --> 39:58.908
So he ends up killing his best friend.

39:59.311 --> 40:00.972
Then why did he do it?

40:01.647 --> 40:03.376
Stuff happens.

40:05.251 --> 40:08.914
An 8-year-old shoots another
kid and you say, "Stuff happens"?

40:09.455 --> 40:11.082
You got a better answer?

40:11.290 --> 40:14.123
No. No, I don't. I don't know.

40:14.326 --> 40:19.389
Maybe his genes are screwy. Or his
parents seem nice but they ignore him?

40:19.765 --> 40:23.565
Maybe he plays too many video games
like every kid in America.

40:25.437 --> 40:28.929
Doesn't it bother you
that there isn't any reason?

40:29.441 --> 40:34.242
No. It bothers me that you cared
about him, and you believed in him...

40:34.446 --> 40:35.970
...and now you feel betrayed.

40:36.181 --> 40:38.513
I don't feel betrayed. I feel...

40:39.218 --> 40:40.617
...scared.

40:41.687 --> 40:45.316
If you don't know what causes it,
how do you keep it from happening?

40:45.891 --> 40:47.688
Are we any different from them?

40:47.893 --> 40:50.453
I mean, they didn't see it coming.
Would we?

40:51.797 --> 40:55.460
You bring a child into this world,
and you think they're helpless.

40:55.668 --> 40:59.570
But, actually, I think it's us.
We're the ones that are helpless.

40:59.772 --> 41:04.505
We probably are. But that's why
you love them as much as you can.

41:04.710 --> 41:08.407
And you teach them as best you can.

41:09.381 --> 41:11.645
And then you wish them good luck.

41:17.222 --> 41:18.746
So, what do you say?

41:19.958 --> 41:21.425
Home...

41:21.827 --> 41:23.624
...bath, bed?

41:30.536 --> 41:31.696
Yeah.

41:35.607 --> 41:38.405
If you don't have any plans.
If you're not busy.

41:38.610 --> 41:41.875
- Drinks sound great. Can we eat too?
- Dinner, absolutely.

41:42.081 --> 41:45.278
I'm meeting with Anspaugh for 20
but I'll be right back.

41:45.484 --> 41:47.384
We're going home. You?

41:47.586 --> 41:50.384
- Catching up on paperwork and...
- Curfew's at 11.

41:50.856 --> 41:52.289
Very funny.

41:58.697 --> 41:59.686
ER.

42:00.766 --> 42:01.858
How about this snow?

42:02.067 --> 42:03.898
- It's great.
- Have a good shift.

42:04.670 --> 42:07.104
You gotta help me!
My wife's having a baby!

42:10.609 --> 42:11.837
Hang on, let me look.

42:12.044 --> 42:14.376
- We're not due for two more weeks.
- Yeah?

42:15.013 --> 42:16.037
Somebody lied.

42:16.248 --> 42:18.148
Oh, God, please help me. Help me.

42:18.350 --> 42:20.784
- We're gonna help you.
- Get Mark and a gurney.

42:20.986 --> 42:23.511
- Do something, please.
- Ma'am, I'm a doctor.

42:27.192 --> 42:28.784
All right. I got it.

42:29.528 --> 42:30.654
Help me up.

42:31.663 --> 42:34.461
- Good. You know how to breathe.
- This is our fourth.

42:34.666 --> 42:36.896
- It's coming.
- When did it start snowing?

42:37.202 --> 42:38.931
- Crowning!
- We're not due yet.

42:39.138 --> 42:41.504
- Must be all the excitement.
- What's your name?

42:41.707 --> 42:45.837
- Louis Bernucci. This is Gilda.
- Nice to meet you. You ready to push?

42:46.044 --> 42:47.739
On the next one, push.

42:47.946 --> 42:50.278
Ready? And one, two, three. Push.

42:55.053 --> 42:57.783
If it's a girl,
I want to name it after Nana.

42:57.990 --> 42:59.116
Ruth?

42:59.658 --> 43:01.023
Ruth Johnson.

43:01.226 --> 43:03.694
Ruth Johnson Bernucci.
What do you think?

43:03.896 --> 43:05.193
It sounds good to me.

43:05.397 --> 43:06.557
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:06.765 --> 43:08.733
Okay, Gilda. I like that.

43:08.934 --> 43:10.094
You're doing great.

43:10.302 --> 43:13.271
Good. This one, push.
This is it. Push!

43:13.472 --> 43:14.769
Oh, God!

43:14.973 --> 43:18.272
Okay, the head's clear. Shoulders.

43:18.877 --> 43:20.504
There we go.

43:20.846 --> 43:23.371
Beautiful baby girl.

43:23.949 --> 43:25.940
Okay, good. Let's wrap her.

43:32.024 --> 43:33.252
There's your mama.

43:36.595 --> 43:39.496
There's your mom. There's your mama.

43:39.698 --> 43:41.529
Okay, clamp.

43:48.040 --> 43:49.200
Excellent.

43:50.242 --> 43:53.609
We're just gonna take over here
just for a minute.

43:53.812 --> 43:56.747
Just a minute.
Coming right back to Mom.

43:59.551 --> 44:00.540
Good job.

44:14.500 --> 44:16.730
You are so beautiful.

44:22.107 --> 44:24.234
Good luck, Ruth Johnson.
