Hey.

04:26.291 --> 04:27.994
No, no, no, no, no!

04:28.027 --> 04:29.962
No, put that away.

04:29.996 --> 04:31.329
It's our pleasure.

04:32.165 --> 04:33.966
Okay

04:34.000 --> 04:36.636
Okay ladies, have a
wonderful day, hmm?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.441
- Bye!
- Bye.

05:04.630 --> 05:06.466
I'm going to leave Dolf here.

05:06.499 --> 05:08.333
He can help you with
the rest of the order.

05:13.072 --> 05:14.306
Okay.

05:25.551 --> 05:27.385
You stay and watch Adalina.

05:28.353 --> 05:30.322
She says you eat too much.

05:30.355 --> 05:32.058
What do you want me to do?

05:32.091 --> 05:34.894
Listen, find her another
big catering order.

05:34.927 --> 05:37.329
And tell them to
request coda pa pushti.

05:37.362 --> 05:38.765
She loves making those.

06:23.408 --> 06:24.544
<i>How goes it?</i>

06:24.577 --> 06:26.112
Another day above the ground.

06:26.145 --> 06:27.880
Amen to to that.

06:27.914 --> 06:29.549
Now this,

06:29.582 --> 06:31.416
this is from last
year's crop;

06:31.450 --> 06:33.486
pulled 'em out before
the ground froze.

06:33.519 --> 06:34.554
I think Adalina
would like 'em.

06:34.587 --> 06:36.556
<i>Ah, thank you, thank you.</i>

06:36.589 --> 06:38.457
- <i>She will appreciate.</i>
- Oh!

06:38.491 --> 06:40.493
Oh, what do we have here?

06:41.627 --> 06:44.063
Oh, my favourite.

06:49.502 --> 06:51.137
Jesus Christ, that's good.

06:54.841 --> 06:58.778
Now, the red dots,
that's straight Crank.

06:58.811 --> 07:01.447
The blue, that's
Mexican Speedball.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.516
<i>The green is, uh, PNP.</i>

07:04.450 --> 07:05.751
Same as usual.

07:05.785 --> 07:07.753
- Ah, you wanna test?
- We're good, we're good.

07:07.787 --> 07:10.590
It's much too cold to
sit around waiting.

07:10.623 --> 07:12.458
Why don't you guys
get that loaded.

07:14.694 --> 07:16.128
Is there a problem?

07:21.100 --> 07:22.935
<i>Very nice, very nice.</i>

07:23.736 --> 07:26.138
- Be well, my friend.
- Nice to see ya.

07:26.172 --> 07:27.506
Thanks for the pastries.

07:32.111 --> 07:33.112
<i>You stick to the speed limit,</i>

07:33.145 --> 07:35.815
<i>use the turn signal,

07:35.848 --> 07:38.618
That Chief at
Stone Creek Reservation,

07:38.651 --> 07:39.986
he has been trying
to renegotiate

07:40.019 --> 07:40.887
so double count,

07:40.920 --> 07:42.822
make sure he's not
trying to short us.

07:42.855 --> 07:44.857
If he does,
break his arms.

08:15.621 --> 08:16.856
Can I help you?

08:17.356 --> 08:20.559
<i>Hey, new guy,
I'm talking to you!</i>

08:21.727 --> 08:23.562
Dude, what were you looking at?

08:24.597 --> 08:26.032
Just heard the music.

08:27.066 --> 08:28.901
Are you gonna complain?

08:28.935 --> 08:30.569
No.

08:32.038 --> 08:33.739
It's the only way to drown
out the rest of the noise

08:33.773 --> 08:35.607

08:36.876 --> 08:38.077
Yeah.

10:49.308 --> 10:51.310
Adalina, I have to go.

10:51.343 --> 10:52.745
What? Where?

10:52.778 --> 10:53.813
I won't be long.

10:53.846 --> 10:55.681
Just go back to sleep.

11:08.994 --> 11:10.796
Get over here.

11:10.830 --> 11:12.231
I've been sent for.

11:33.419 --> 11:35.988
<i>Thank you for
coming, my friend.</i>

11:36.021 --> 11:38.057
You know, there's
a diner nearby.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.725
It would be warmer.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.061
<i>I like the cold.</i>

11:42.094 --> 11:44.396
<i>It reminds me of Moscow.</i>

11:44.431 --> 11:45.831
Ah.

11:50.803 --> 11:52.238
How's the family?

11:53.440 --> 11:56.876
<i>Never have kids
after the age of 50.</i>

11:56.909 --> 11:57.877
I can't keep up.

11:57.910 --> 11:59.879
All I do is hand out money.

12:00.779 --> 12:03.415
And the beautiful Adalina,
she's good, yes?

12:03.450 --> 12:05.284
- She is.
- Good.

12:11.056 --> 12:14.059
<i>You heard about
that business, uh,</i>

12:14.093 --> 12:15.895
<i>with my associates?</i>

12:15.928 --> 12:18.130
The reports didn't say
who was responsible.

12:18.864 --> 12:22.668
The Aryan Brotherhood
is responsible.

12:23.335 --> 12:27.773
<i>We had a deal that was
fair and was honourable.</i>

12:27.806 --> 12:30.009

have no honour.

12:34.813 --> 12:37.450
<i>And now the problems
is yours to amend.</i>

12:38.951 --> 12:40.052
I don't see why.

12:40.085 --> 12:42.955
I've never had anything
to do with them.

12:42.988 --> 12:44.390
The Ochstag voted.

12:44.423 --> 12:45.958
It's not our fight, Vladimir.

12:46.959 --> 12:47.927
I like how things are.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.829
We keep our heads down,
stay below the radar.

12:50.863 --> 12:53.098
This complicates things.

12:54.300 --> 12:55.801
If they are coming after me,

12:55.834 --> 12:57.236
how long do you
think it would be

12:57.269 --> 12:58.871
before they come after you?

13:18.324 --> 13:21.727
<i>Strange how fate works,
is it not?</i>

13:24.531 --> 13:28.968
<i>When this is over
I will make sure</i>

13:29.001 --> 13:30.202
<i>that he is left alone.</i>

13:31.971 --> 13:33.806
<i>That should please you.</i>

13:35.007 --> 13:37.009
<i>Your pet, free at last.</i>

13:49.321 --> 13:51.123
<i>Did you know he was out?</i>

13:51.156 --> 13:52.358
No.

13:59.566 --> 14:02.001
You'd have to kill me
to put that on my body.

14:07.906 --> 14:09.908
<i>You wouldn't have
lasted a week, Malick.</i>

14:13.279 --> 14:15.881
<i>He coulda just
punched his own ticket.</i>

14:15.914 --> 14:17.116
And did it all.

14:17.684 --> 14:19.318
<i>Guys like Lance, they fight.</i>

14:19.351 --> 14:21.353
That's just how they're wired.

<i>If a man's born

14:23.590 --> 14:25.791
<i>there's only two
ways he can go.</i>

14:26.258 --> 14:27.893
<i>He can be a victim.</i>

14:28.127 --> 14:29.562
Or you fight.

14:38.937 --> 14:40.573
You did everything you could.

15:24.350 --> 15:26.185
<i>Hey, whatsup?</i>

15:36.028 --> 15:38.330

15:38.364 --> 15:39.998
Yeah, sure.

15:41.133 --> 15:42.334

17:45.758 --> 17:47.159
Hi.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.161
You following me?

17:50.262 --> 17:51.798
Not a lot of places
to get a bottle

17:51.831 --> 17:54.099

you know?

17:56.268 --> 17:57.770
I'm fucking with you.

17:57.804 --> 17:59.204
Oh.

18:02.274 --> 18:03.476
Man, what's your deal?

18:03.510 --> 18:04.477
Are you like,
always a dick

18:04.511 --> 18:06.144
or just to me?

18:07.480 --> 18:09.214
I'm just not one for talking.

18:09.248 --> 18:10.650
Oh, gotcha.

18:11.283 --> 18:13.486
<i>Wow, love the song.</i>

18:13.520 --> 18:15.153
<i>Great set, Anna.</i>

18:16.489 --> 18:18.525
<i>You remind me
of Billy Jean Waters.</i>

18:20.593 --> 18:23.429
"Nobody Knows When
You're Down and Out."

18:25.130 --> 18:27.132
Nope, I've got nothing.

18:28.434 --> 18:30.737
It's supposed to
be a compliment.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.170
<i>I know I'm
only small-town good,</i>

18:32.204 --> 18:33.640
but thanks.

18:37.175 --> 18:39.177
That's no good
for your voice.

18:49.354 --> 18:50.690
<i>Hey, I'm back.</i>

18:50.723 --> 18:52.859
<i>Thanks for sticking around.</i>

19:57.724 --> 19:59.324
<i>You look good.</i>

20:00.560 --> 20:02.160
You look old.

20:09.267 --> 20:11.904
<i>Are you hiding

20:12.872 --> 20:15.307
I ain't hiding from anyone.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.576
Just wanna be left alone.

20:19.712 --> 20:21.714
<i>I came down
there more than once</i>

20:21.748 --> 20:23.750
but they said you
wouldn't see me.

20:28.621 --> 20:30.823
The Russians fucked me.

20:32.759 --> 20:34.761
<i>After all I did for
them and for you.</i>

20:35.895 --> 20:37.362
You let it happen.

20:37.396 --> 20:39.264
<i>I did everything that I could.</i>

20:39.297 --> 20:40.500
My hands were tied.

20:41.067 --> 20:42.435
<i>You put an Estonian Captain</i>

20:42.468 --> 20:44.537
<i>in a fucking
wheelchair for life.</i>

20:44.570 --> 20:46.371
<i>A direct descendant

20:46.405 --> 20:48.407
What did you expect?

20:48.441 --> 20:50.810
- He baited me.
- <i>And you bit.</i>

20:50.843 --> 20:53.311
He'll never walk
again and you, what?

20:53.345 --> 20:54.814
You lost 15 years.

20:55.915 --> 20:57.517
<i>All you had to do
was walk away.</i>

20:58.818 --> 21:00.218
Fuck 'em.

21:00.419 --> 21:01.621
Even now?

21:06.492 --> 21:07.694
Just get to it.

21:08.461 --> 21:10.763
I'm here to offer
you an olive branch.

21:11.831 --> 21:15.601
The Russians, they are
prepared to let the past go,

21:15.635 --> 21:16.836
<i>let you free.</i>

21:17.503 --> 21:19.337
And why would they do that?

21:23.943 --> 21:26.344
<i>They need a favour.</i>

21:28.380 --> 21:30.616
<i>They assassinated a
high-ranking Russian.</i>

21:31.316 --> 21:33.720
<i>Trying to move in on
the meth distribution.</i>

21:37.023 --> 21:39.859
You have no idea what
you're asking me to do.

21:53.573 --> 21:54.807
Yeah?

21:55.307 --> 21:57.409
<i>I think that should be enough</i>

21:57.443 --> 21:59.445
to get you wherever
you want to go.

22:01.013 --> 22:04.316
<i>Lance, I promise,</i>

22:04.349 --> 22:06.351
no one will come
looking for you.

22:08.420 --> 22:09.856
What if I say no?

22:10.623 --> 22:12.859
Then everything you
endured in prison

22:12.892 --> 22:14.494
would be for nothing.

22:14.527 --> 22:17.463
Freedom, real freedom,

22:17.497 --> 22:18.898
has a price.

22:19.364 --> 22:21.734
Can you imagine
sleeping without a gun?

22:25.538 --> 22:26.739
I think you know

22:27.673 --> 22:29.274
this is the only option.

22:44.957 --> 22:46.492
Make peace with it.

22:46.526 --> 22:48.528
<i>And we'll talk
in the morning.</i>

22:59.806 --> 23:01.373
<i>Excuse me.</i>

23:01.406 --> 23:02.542
Hi, honey.

23:02.575 --> 23:04.409
I am so not your honey.

23:06.979 --> 23:08.413
Hey!

23:08.714 --> 23:10.315
<i>Friends of yours?</i>

23:20.059 --> 23:21.527
How'd the rest of your set go?

23:21.561 --> 23:22.762
<i>It went.</i>

23:23.796 --> 23:25.431
Shoulda stuck around.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.569
I'm not much for crowds,
even small ones.

23:29.602 --> 23:31.070
Well it woulda been really
nice to play for someone

23:31.103 --> 23:32.939
who actually appreciated it.

23:33.439 --> 23:35.608
You know, there are places

23:35.641 --> 23:37.476
<i>that appreciate
talent like yours.</i>

23:38.010 --> 23:40.913
You just gotta find 'em,
you know?

23:40.947 --> 23:43.415
Man, I barely make rent, okay?

23:43.449 --> 23:45.451
All I have in my fridge
are half-eaten noodles

23:45.484 --> 23:47.486
and a bottle of hot sauce.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.956
<i>I have no idea how I'm
gonna get to tomorrow so,</i>

23:50.823 --> 23:53.025
Smoke Stack's the
only place I got.

23:58.531 --> 23:59.899
<i>Good night.</i>

23:59.932 --> 24:01.534
Good night.

24:09.041 --> 24:10.476
Could you wait outside?

24:13.880 --> 24:15.581
<i>Let me do what
has to be done.</i>

24:15.615 --> 24:17.116
<i>I'll find a way.</i>

24:17.149 --> 24:20.586
<i>No, I want you to
find out who the girl is.</i>

24:20.620 --> 24:22.622
I need to be doing more, okay?

24:22.655 --> 24:23.656
The others-

24:24.657 --> 24:25.758
They don't respect me.

24:25.791 --> 24:27.392
Let me prove myself.

24:30.062 --> 24:32.498
You will have your
time to make your mark.

24:32.531 --> 24:34.834
With them and with the Ochstag.

24:34.867 --> 24:36.502
Just not now.

24:38.070 --> 24:39.839
<i>Unless?</i>

24:39.872 --> 24:41.707
<i>How do you know he won't run?</i>

24:43.576 --> 24:45.410
<i>30 years of history.</i>

25:07.900 --> 25:09.101
Fuck!

25:31.590 --> 25:36.729
<i>♪ Once I had a life
as a millionaire ♪</i>

25:36.762 --> 25:41.233
<i>♪ Spending my money
I didn't care ♪</i>

25:41.267 --> 25:44.770
<i>♪ Took all my friends out ♪</i>

26:02.588 --> 26:03.589
I can't.

26:04.657 --> 26:06.092
<i>I can't be that guy.</i>

26:06.125 --> 26:07.760
But you still are him, Lance.

26:12.898 --> 26:14.600
- <i>I can change.</i>
- No.

26:15.435 --> 26:18.004
Human nature always
bares its teeth.

26:18.804 --> 26:20.673
<i>No matter what you
tell yourself,</i>

26:20.706 --> 26:22.141
<i>you are who you are.</i>

26:23.309 --> 26:25.511
And you know you
have to do this.

26:35.721 --> 26:38.557
Kill them, kill them all.

26:38.991 --> 26:41.827
<i>No witnesses,
no loose ends.</i>

26:44.030 --> 26:45.164
<i>When it's done,</i>

26:45.197 --> 26:48.768
I'll tell you where I left
the money and the passport.

26:48.801 --> 26:50.336
<i>And then,</i>

26:50.369 --> 26:52.204
<i>then we can talk
about change.</i>

29:09.775 --> 29:10.976
<i>The fuck you want?</i>

29:11.010 --> 29:12.845
Just got out of the joint.

29:14.079 --> 29:16.081
I'm looking to connect
with my brothers.

29:17.983 --> 29:19.185
<i>Where'd you do your time.</i>

29:19.985 --> 29:21.187
Millhaven.

29:22.455 --> 29:23.856
T Block.

29:25.991 --> 29:27.193
<i>What's your name, brother?</i>

29:28.194 --> 29:29.429
Lance Hunter.

29:30.796 --> 29:31.797
Run him.

29:34.133 --> 29:35.334
It's for you.

29:38.871 --> 29:40.706
So you know I can earn.

29:45.878 --> 29:47.112
Let's get inside.

29:51.817 --> 29:53.018
Want a tag on the Yukon.

29:55.888 --> 29:57.323
<i>How long you been out?</i>

29:57.990 --> 29:59.391
Not long.

30:00.493 --> 30:03.896
Usually someone would let
us know a new face coming by.

30:04.730 --> 30:07.933
Didn't know where I was
gonna settle when I got out.

30:09.401 --> 30:11.036
Needed some time to breathe.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.072
I hear that.

30:15.508 --> 30:17.309
Well, you check out
with my man in Millhaven.

30:17.343 --> 30:20.012
Says you did some
heavy work inside.

30:21.481 --> 30:23.082
Anything for the Brotherhood.

30:29.221 --> 30:30.422
I'm wondering-

30:31.558 --> 30:34.360
Before you hit lockup,

30:34.393 --> 30:36.028
who'd you do to get pinched?

30:38.565 --> 30:40.332
<i>Where are you from?</i>

30:40.366 --> 30:43.202
<i>Who you ran with,
that sort of thing?</i>

30:43.235 --> 30:44.870
I don't-

30:48.508 --> 30:50.510
I'll know everything
soon enough.

30:52.579 --> 30:53.979
<i>For now,</i>

30:54.947 --> 30:56.382
we're just gonna wait.

31:57.510 --> 31:58.611
Ah, fuck.

33:09.314 --> 33:11.049
<i>Is it done?</i>

33:11.083 --> 33:12.317
It's done.

33:13.085 --> 33:14.521
Money and passport

33:14.554 --> 33:16.388
is in the air duct
in your hall.

33:17.590 --> 33:19.459
<i>It was there the whole time.</i>

33:19.492 --> 33:21.093
I had faith in you.

33:23.328 --> 33:24.531
Good luck.

33:37.142 --> 33:38.410

33:40.179 --> 33:43.015
No, no, no, uncle, just-

33:43.783 --> 33:45.984
Let me earn it on my own.

33:47.152 --> 33:48.455
<i>So what now?</i>

33:48.488 --> 33:50.155
What now?

33:50.189 --> 33:52.257
We let things get
back to normal.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.959
I mean with Lance.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.162

Hey, Anna?

38:10.483 --> 38:11.684
Oh, hey!

38:13.418 --> 38:14.687
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:16.889 --> 38:18.891
- Are you?
- Yeah.

38:20.526 --> 38:21.728
Let's get you upstairs.

38:29.401 --> 38:30.536
You okay?

38:30.570 --> 38:32.404
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

38:47.520 --> 38:48.921
What are you doing?

38:50.490 --> 38:53.258
I believe, sleeping
it off is the term.

38:56.729 --> 38:59.397
<i>I mean, what are you
doing in this shithole town?</i>

38:59.432 --> 39:01.033
<i>At some point you're
gonna have to pick:</i>

39:01.067 --> 39:04.971
The music or this,
this place.

39:05.004 --> 39:07.405
Who could give up
all this, though?

39:11.110 --> 39:13.513
<i>Look, I don't need
a lecture, okay?</i>

39:13.546 --> 39:14.514
<i>Mhm.</i>

39:14.547 --> 39:15.748
You're not my father.

39:17.415 --> 39:18.618
No, I'm not.

39:19.384 --> 39:20.520
But if I was,

39:20.553 --> 39:21.521
I would drag you
out of here.

39:21.554 --> 39:24.356
Do whatever it takes to
give you an opportunity.

39:25.558 --> 39:29.361
Yeah, all he gave
me was bad dreams.

39:30.963 --> 39:33.800
<i>Been on my own since
I was 15, okay?</i>

39:36.401 --> 39:37.804
No one's dragging me anywhere.

39:41.974 --> 39:43.976
Well you're gonna
have to do it then.

39:45.878 --> 39:48.481
<i>You and I should not end
up in the same place.</i>

39:51.450 --> 39:52.952
You deserve better.

40:24.817 --> 40:27.720
So, any problems?

40:27.753 --> 40:29.555
Buyers are asking for more.

40:30.590 --> 40:32.658
Sounds like Rainer's
getting a new mining camp,

40:32.692 --> 40:34.126
so we should get in on that.

40:34.794 --> 40:37.395
Looks like there's room
for growth all around.

40:38.931 --> 40:41.434
And that's more weight.

40:41.467 --> 40:43.502
We'll need to start
sending two vehicles.

40:43.536 --> 40:45.438
So we have to make sure
we have enough security.

40:45.471 --> 40:46.973
I'll go, I can
take care of that.

40:47.006 --> 40:48.441
<i>No, no you stay here.</i>

40:49.141 --> 40:51.177
Dolf and Pieter, they can-

40:51.210 --> 40:52.645
They can handle it.

40:54.647 --> 40:56.449
Did you, um, find
out about the girl?

40:57.650 --> 40:59.785
Uh, waitress,
works at a bar,

40:59.819 --> 41:01.419
<i>not much to know.</i>

41:01.721 --> 41:02.955
Her and Lance?

41:03.723 --> 41:04.957
I'm not sure.

41:06.492 --> 41:07.693
What's he doing here?

41:20.806 --> 41:23.676
I didn't know you were coming.

41:23.709 --> 41:24.710
I know.

41:52.872 --> 41:55.875
How bad is it?

41:55.908 --> 41:57.109
<i>A witness.</i>

41:57.910 --> 41:59.078
10-year-old boy.

41:59.111 --> 42:00.246
<i>What did he see?</i>

42:00.279 --> 42:02.114
Everything,
including your man.

42:03.649 --> 42:04.984
<i>He's in police custody now.</i>

42:05.017 --> 42:08.054
<i>It's only a matter of time
before he IDs your man.</i>

42:08.087 --> 42:13.092
<i>Either to the police or to the
Aryan Brotherhood or to both.</i>

42:14.660 --> 42:17.096
How insulated are
you from him?

42:17.129 --> 42:18.197
Enough.

42:18.230 --> 42:19.632
Hm.

42:21.901 --> 42:24.070
If he should talk and
mention your name-

42:24.103 --> 42:26.105
No, no, he would never talk.

42:26.772 --> 42:32.678
Greger, this is a man who
has just done 15 hard years

42:32.712 --> 42:34.747
because we put him there.

42:34.780 --> 42:37.717
This is a man who knows
that we ordered a hit

42:37.750 --> 42:38.951
on him in prison.

42:40.252 --> 42:41.654
This is a man

42:42.521 --> 42:45.891
who knows that he can kill
two birds with one stone

42:45.925 --> 42:47.526
if he talks.

42:52.164 --> 42:53.599
Put your dog down

42:53.632 --> 42:55.201
and anyone
associated with him.

42:55.234 --> 42:56.736
<i>Vladimir no, please,</i>

42:56.769 --> 42:58.604
there's got to be another way.

42:58.637 --> 42:59.839
<i>There is another way.</i>

43:00.639 --> 43:03.909
I can insulate myself
from everybody,

43:03.943 --> 43:05.544
<i>including you.</i>

43:07.079 --> 43:09.682
<i>Vladimir, what a nice surprise.</i>

43:10.316 --> 43:12.318
<i>The beautiful Adalina!</i>

43:14.720 --> 43:17.523
Oh, it is a sight
for old eyes.

43:18.190 --> 43:19.725
Come, let me make you
something to eat.

43:19.759 --> 43:21.761
No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

43:21.794 --> 43:24.163
I have a stupid business
meeting I have to get to.

43:24.196 --> 43:25.664
At least let me get
pastries for the kids.

43:25.698 --> 43:27.767
No, no, no, no,
not today, not today.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.335
But I promise you this,

43:29.368 --> 43:31.637
I will come back soon,

43:31.670 --> 43:33.272
and I'll bring all the boys.

43:48.788 --> 43:50.623
Just, uh, just business.

43:51.957 --> 43:53.325
Is everything okay?

43:53.359 --> 43:55.828
Yeah, mmhmm.

43:55.861 --> 43:57.329
- Never better.
- Yeah?

43:59.198 --> 44:00.599
Yeah, okay.

44:23.756 --> 44:25.791
I need to ask
something of you.

44:26.826 --> 44:29.395
Lance, he has to go.

44:29.429 --> 44:31.630
And I need it to be
you who does it.

44:35.734 --> 44:36.936
The girl,

44:37.504 --> 44:40.239
you can't lead any
breadcrumbs back here.

44:40.272 --> 44:43.342
Okay wait, are you
sure that that's smart?

44:45.878 --> 44:48.681
<i>Lance, he left me no choice.</i>

45:45.938 --> 45:47.339
<i>Just thinking.</i>

45:55.281 --> 45:57.917
The last thing my, uh-

45:57.950 --> 46:00.286
<i>my father said to
me before he died.</i>

46:06.125 --> 46:08.894
I never really
understood it until now.

46:10.296 --> 46:11.897
I haven't heard
you even mention

46:11.931 --> 46:13.732
your father since he died.

46:15.968 --> 46:17.169
He was a good man.

46:18.871 --> 46:20.906
Why are all men
remembered as something

46:20.940 --> 46:22.808
they weren't when
they were alive.

46:27.179 --> 46:28.380
Adalina?

46:30.483 --> 46:32.418
Are you happy?

46:32.452 --> 46:33.852
Of course.

46:33.886 --> 46:35.721
<i>We could go anywhere.</i>

46:37.823 --> 46:40.159
Back to Helsinki,
back home.

46:40.192 --> 46:42.194
But this is home, here.

46:42.228 --> 46:45.130
<i>We have a life,
a business.</i>

46:45.164 --> 46:46.999
This is where we grow old.

46:55.174 --> 46:56.809
Greger, how bad is it?

46:59.311 --> 47:01.313
Smells good, whatever's
cooking in the oven.

47:03.382 --> 47:05.384
and don't do that.

47:06.486 --> 47:08.420
I can see it on your face.

47:10.523 --> 47:11.924
<i>I'm here.</i>

47:13.158 --> 47:15.361
<i>You don't have to
carry it all alone.</i>

47:18.030 --> 47:19.499
It's nothing.

47:19.532 --> 47:21.568
You just concentrate
on the bakery, okay?

47:21.601 --> 47:23.470
Oh, I'll
just stay mute

47:23.503 --> 47:26.005
and-and smile and
be a good woman.

47:26.038 --> 47:27.239
Don't ask questions, right?

47:27.273 --> 47:28.907
<i>That's not what I'm saying.</i>

47:30.175 --> 47:33.178
This is our life.

47:33.212 --> 47:34.813
<i>It's not just yours.</i>

47:36.348 --> 47:39.018
<i>We built this life together.</i>

47:39.051 --> 47:40.886
So if what we built,

47:40.919 --> 47:44.857
if what we built
is in jeopardy,

47:44.890 --> 47:46.593
I have every right to ask,

47:46.626 --> 47:48.260
every right to be heard.

47:50.062 --> 47:51.864
You don't wanna know.

47:51.897 --> 47:53.365
I hear.

47:53.399 --> 47:55.000
I see.

47:55.602 --> 47:58.037
Don't tell me what I do
or don't want to know.

47:58.070 --> 47:59.938
You've never wanted to
know anything before today.

47:59.972 --> 48:02.207
<i>I've never had the
need to ask before.</i>

48:03.476 --> 48:04.910
So you tell me,

48:04.943 --> 48:07.946
why do I feel the need
to know now, hmm?

48:11.651 --> 48:12.885
Adalina!

48:36.041 --> 48:38.110
<i>Before you do it,</i>

48:38.143 --> 48:39.345
<i>I want to speak to him.</i>

50:55.715 --> 50:57.115

50:58.451 --> 51:00.285
<i>I'm gonna be the
one that does it.</i>

51:00.787 --> 51:02.221
That's not how he wants it.

51:03.756 --> 51:05.157
It's how I want it.

51:07.259 --> 51:09.094
I'm making the call.

51:09.127 --> 51:10.763
No you're not.

51:11.731 --> 51:14.567
You don't want any part of
what's waiting in there.

51:17.202 --> 51:18.505
It's our job.

51:19.606 --> 51:22.575
<i>If anything happens,
we have to answer for it.</i>

51:22.609 --> 51:24.209
Let us do it.

52:38.350 --> 52:39.318
<i>Yeah?</i>

52:39.351 --> 52:40.319
<i>He ain't here.</i>

52:40.352 --> 52:41.320
<i>But he'll be back.</i>

52:41.353 --> 52:42.455
<i>How do you know?</i>

52:42.488 --> 52:44.089
<i>Oh, he'll be back.</i>

52:45.357 --> 52:46.459
<i>The girl ain't here either.</i>

52:46.492 --> 52:48.561
<i>There's a note that says
she's at the Smoke Stack.</i>

52:49.562 --> 52:51.631
<i>Okay, we'll go to her.</i>

53:54.594 --> 53:56.663
<i>Lance, I had no choice.</i>

53:58.498 --> 54:00.365
<i>You need to know that.</i>

54:00.399 --> 54:02.334
<i>This isn't how I
wanted it to end.</i>

54:03.603 --> 54:05.237
<i>Good bye my friend.</i>

54:09.408 --> 54:11.978
<i>It's okay, just let go.</i>

55:48.441 --> 55:50.375
I'm gonna drop
you at the bar.

55:50.408 --> 55:52.812
<i>You stay on the girl,
make sure she's alone.</i>

55:52.845 --> 55:54.914
<i>I'll go back and
check on 'em.</i>

55:54.947 --> 55:56.381
No.

55:57.216 --> 55:59.619
<i>Greger says you're
to stay away.</i>

56:00.119 --> 56:03.523
<i>Greger said
you stay on the girl.</i>

56:03.556 --> 56:07.392

you're gonna do, right?

What do you mean gone?

57:46.225 --> 57:48.527
Dolf and Koso are dead.

57:48.561 --> 57:50.395
What? Are you sure?

57:50.863 --> 57:52.498
I'm looking at 'em.

57:55.101 --> 57:56.469
Um, the girl?

57:57.236 --> 57:58.504
Pieter's on her.

57:58.537 --> 58:00.573
She's at a bar.

58:00.606 --> 58:02.508
<i>He can't get her in
front of a crowd.</i>

58:02.541 --> 58:04.977
That's where he'll go
now that he knows.

58:06.212 --> 58:07.613
We're on our way.

58:29.168 --> 58:30.236
Yeah?

58:30.269 --> 58:31.671
<i>He got away.</i>

58:31.704 --> 58:33.039
<i>He's coming to you.</i>

<i>I'll be back by morning.</i>

59:16.749 --> 59:18.951
I know, it's nothing really.

59:21.754 --> 59:24.724
You tell me all about it
when you come home then.

59:24.757 --> 59:25.758
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:00:14.874 --> 01:00:15.708
Ah, you know what, guys?

01:00:15.741 --> 01:00:17.943

<i>You don't need to do this.</i>

You can go out the
front door right now.

01:01:03.389 --> 01:01:05.991

Ah, you know what, guys?

01:03:21.894 --> 01:03:23.729
I'm gonna get a quick drink.

01:03:48.153 --> 01:03:49.355
Anna, wait.

01:03:49.388 --> 01:03:51.257
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, please!

01:03:55.894 --> 01:03:57.896
- Hey, wait, wait
- No, don't touch me!

01:03:57.930 --> 01:03:58.897
<i>I had no choice.</i>

01:03:58.931 --> 01:04:00.866
I had no choice, he was
gonna fuckin' hurt you.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.068
<i>You're
still in danger.</i>

01:04:03.102 --> 01:04:05.104
<i>Find a cop and go
somewhere safe now!</i>

01:04:44.009 --> 01:04:46.245
Yeah, I need some help.

01:04:47.079 --> 01:04:48.080
He's dead.

01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:51.083
Ah, Smoke Stack,

01:04:51.116 --> 01:04:52.552
it's, um-

01:05:03.962 --> 01:05:06.599
<i>Greger,
the kid identified Lance.</i>

01:05:09.101 --> 01:05:11.438
I'm on my way to
handle it myself.

01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:13.105
<i>What will happen to the kid?</i>

01:05:13.138 --> 01:05:14.306
The kid is too well protected

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.408
by the police and the Aryans.

01:05:16.443 --> 01:05:19.978
Which means these ends
have to be tied up now!

01:05:20.012 --> 01:05:21.246
I will take care of it.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.482
<i>You better.</i>

01:05:22.515 --> 01:05:25.417
Because if you have not
done it in 60 minutes,

01:05:25.452 --> 01:05:28.120
I will tidy up
the ends myself.

01:05:28.153 --> 01:05:29.988
What does that mean?

01:05:53.078 --> 01:05:54.046
<i>Hey!</i>

01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.515
Hey, uh-

01:05:55.881 --> 01:05:57.082
<i>How's it going there?</i>

01:05:57.116 --> 01:05:58.485
Good.

01:05:58.518 --> 01:06:00.520
I'm just waiting for
the last batch to bake.

01:06:02.154 --> 01:06:03.122
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:06:03.155 --> 01:06:04.289
Yeah.

01:06:04.323 --> 01:06:09.094
Yeah, I just, uh, I wanted
to hear how you were doing.

01:06:09.128 --> 01:06:10.329
Greger, I-

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.365
I was thinking and-

01:06:13.399 --> 01:06:17.470
the bakery and all this I-

01:06:17.504 --> 01:06:19.371
you know, may-maybe
we could sell it

01:06:19.405 --> 01:06:22.141
and, uh, move somewhere warm.
I mean-

01:06:23.342 --> 01:06:26.044
I mean, if it helps with, um,

01:06:26.078 --> 01:06:28.548
making it better or if I-

01:06:28.581 --> 01:06:30.450
But you love the bakery.

01:06:30.483 --> 01:06:31.684
I do, I-

01:06:33.152 --> 01:06:34.353
I do, um-

01:06:35.387 --> 01:06:37.156
You know, but, I-

01:06:37.189 --> 01:06:38.323
I'm starting to wonder.

01:06:38.357 --> 01:06:39.559
No, my love.

01:06:41.059 --> 01:06:42.695
We grow old there.

01:06:44.564 --> 01:06:45.998
I'll be home soon.

01:06:46.433 --> 01:06:48.501
<i>Don't stay too late.</i>

01:06:48.535 --> 01:06:51.236
But will you wake me
when you come home?

01:06:52.539 --> 01:06:53.939
Always.

01:06:55.775 --> 01:06:57.009
Good night.

01:08:02.307 --> 01:08:04.142
Calling on a dead man's phone?

01:08:04.844 --> 01:08:06.378
Yeah, I'm gone.

01:08:06.411 --> 01:08:07.614
It's over.

01:08:08.581 --> 01:08:12.184
I wish it was,
oh I truly do.

01:08:13.285 --> 01:08:14.286
<i>I leave.</i>

01:08:15.622 --> 01:08:18.223
And nobody comes
looking for me, right?

01:08:19.492 --> 01:08:21.828
You left a witness, Lance.

01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:25.497
And you have killed
three of my men.

01:08:25.532 --> 01:08:28.166
<i>There is only one
way this ends.</i>

01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:33.171
I'm out.
The girl is safe.

01:08:33.205 --> 01:08:35.307
<i>You have nothing.</i>

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.444
So why the call, huh?

01:08:38.478 --> 01:08:41.078
If this is truly over, hm?

01:08:43.314 --> 01:08:45.149
<i>Oh, you need me to say it.</i>

01:08:45.785 --> 01:08:49.187
You're looking for some kind
of pass for you and the girl.

01:08:50.389 --> 01:08:51.823
She's not safe, Lance.

01:08:55.495 --> 01:08:57.497
Why are you fuckin' lying?

01:08:57.529 --> 01:09:00.800
Wait two minutes and
answer this phone.

01:09:18.183 --> 01:09:19.519
<i>He has Dolf's phone.</i>

01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:22.220
<i>Let him know that
she is alive,</i>

01:09:22.254 --> 01:09:23.622
and then you kill her.

01:09:23.656 --> 01:09:24.857
What?

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:28.327
<i>Make sure he knows it.</i>

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.529
<i>Wait,
can't we just use her to</i>

01:09:30.563 --> 01:09:32.732
make him come in?

01:09:32.765 --> 01:09:36.803
Her alive gives him reason
to be careful, cunning.

01:09:36.836 --> 01:09:39.237
Her dead, he turns
into an animal.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:42.107
He will want to tear us
apart with his bare hands.

01:09:42.374 --> 01:09:45.243
<i>We will use it to
our advantage.</i>

01:09:45.277 --> 01:09:47.279
<i>We've already lost
too many men.</i>

01:09:47.947 --> 01:09:50.483
Under your watch,
nephew, yeah?

01:09:50.515 --> 01:09:52.685
<i>So if you cannot do it,
then you wait for me.</i>

01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:54.721
I will fucking do it myself!

01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:00.426
But if you want to
make your mark,

01:10:03.295 --> 01:10:04.296
this is the time,

01:10:06.733 --> 01:10:08.133
nephew.

01:10:09.401 --> 01:10:10.603
This is the time.

01:10:36.395 --> 01:10:37.597
Hey, Lance.

01:10:39.766 --> 01:10:41.366
I'm calling your bluff.

01:10:45.303 --> 01:10:50.375
I wish
I'd never met you.

01:10:50.409 --> 01:10:51.778
Anna.

01:10:51.811 --> 01:10:52.812
<i>Anna, listen to me!</i>

01:10:52.845 --> 01:10:53.946
Fuck you!

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.380
Anna!

01:11:02.622 --> 01:11:04.222
He wants me to kill her.

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:06.626
<i>I swear to God,</i>

01:11:06.659 --> 01:11:07.660
if you fucking touch her,

01:11:07.694 --> 01:11:09.327
<i>I will kill you.</i>

01:11:10.295 --> 01:11:11.497
I have to.

01:11:13.933 --> 01:11:15.468
It is not too late.

01:11:15.501 --> 01:11:17.335
In this thing of ours we-

01:11:18.671 --> 01:11:20.305
We don't get to choose.

01:11:21.607 --> 01:11:25.343
I will fucking
kill all of you.

01:11:25.377 --> 01:11:26.612
- Sorry.
- <i>Malick?</i>

01:11:27.513 --> 01:11:30.282
Malick?

01:11:30.315 --> 01:11:31.316
<i>Malick!</i>

01:11:31.784 --> 01:11:33.653
<i>Malick, fuck!</i>

01:11:33.686 --> 01:11:35.420
<i>Malick, fuck, fuck!</i>

01:11:37.724 --> 01:11:39.025
Malick!

01:11:39.058 --> 01:11:40.493
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:11:43.496 --> 01:11:45.297
<i>Malick!</i>

01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:47.365
<i>Malick you fuck!</i>

01:11:48.901 --> 01:11:50.302
<i>Malick!</i>

01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:57.342
Fuck!

01:11:57.977 --> 01:11:59.545
<i>Malick!</i>

01:12:00.079 --> 01:12:01.514
<i>Malick!</i>

01:12:07.453 --> 01:12:08.488
Fuck!

01:12:09.021 --> 01:12:10.422
Malick you-

01:13:26.465 --> 01:13:28.668
You did what had to be done.

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:46.953
<i>You want me, you got me.</i>

01:13:46.986 --> 01:13:48.487
The back of the lumber yard.

01:13:48.521 --> 01:13:50.556
Exit 117.

01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:53.793
<i>I will watch you die.</i>

01:13:57.630 --> 01:13:59.031
<i>He wants us to go to him.</i>

01:13:59.432 --> 01:14:01.067
Then let's take it to him.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.501
<i>No.</i>

01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:07.860
<i>Is it done?</i>

01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:47.793
No.

01:17:47.827 --> 01:17:48.794
No, no!

01:17:48.828 --> 01:17:50.029
<i>Malick!</i>

01:17:54.867 --> 01:17:56.669
<i>You fucking killed her!</i>

01:17:58.438 --> 01:18:00.272
<i>You fucking killed her!</i>

01:18:00.606 --> 01:18:01.807
<i>Malick!</i>

01:18:20.726 --> 01:18:21.794
<i>You killed her!</i>

01:20:00.125 --> 01:20:01.760
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:20:04.897 --> 01:20:06.765
Oh.

01:20:06.799 --> 01:20:08.234
Fuck!

01:20:12.938 --> 01:20:15.774
What the fuck are
you smiling at?

01:20:17.444 --> 01:20:20.279
You still don't see it,
do you?

01:20:22.848 --> 01:20:24.850
<i>You could've run,
any time.</i>

01:20:25.619 --> 01:20:28.988
You would've come
looking for me.

01:20:29.021 --> 01:20:30.856
<i>But you could've run.</i>

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:32.825
<i>You didn't.</i>

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:35.327
You

01:20:35.361 --> 01:20:36.862
hid 20 miles

01:20:37.963 --> 01:20:39.164
from us.

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:43.002
You wanted to be found.

01:20:43.035 --> 01:20:44.270
<i>No.</i>

01:20:46.105 --> 01:20:47.906
I wanted out.

01:20:48.475 --> 01:20:51.478
You wanted to be the
man who wanted out.

01:20:54.046 --> 01:20:55.482
Wanted to fight.

01:20:56.549 --> 01:20:57.983
Needed to fight.

01:20:59.385 --> 01:21:00.819
<i>You missed it.</i>

01:21:04.857 --> 01:21:07.226
You could've ambushed us
with automatic weapons, no?

01:21:09.395 --> 01:21:13.032
You, you wanted to kill
Malick with your bare hands.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.969
<i>You wanted to look
me in the eye</i>

01:21:18.003 --> 01:21:19.204
before I die.

01:21:22.374 --> 01:21:25.010
I didn't want anything
to happen to her.

01:21:25.044 --> 01:21:26.879
I know, Lance, I know.

01:21:27.146 --> 01:21:28.347
But,

01:21:29.948 --> 01:21:31.183
here we are.

01:21:31.685 --> 01:21:33.886
<i>You bring death
wherever you go.</i>

01:21:36.255 --> 01:21:38.223
First time I saw you,

01:21:38.257 --> 01:21:40.893
<i>I knew you were a
force of nature.</i>

01:21:41.927 --> 01:21:44.063
You were born to kill-
