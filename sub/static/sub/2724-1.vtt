- Yes.

Ortolan, eat it with a

ourselves without anyone watching.

are closing every week in this country?

Helen, they need forks
as well as spoons for dessert,

38:28.056 --> 38:29.729
they're not having Fruit Corners.

not "dessert".

- Where did you learn that?
- University?

be going for President.

- Mate, how long have we been friends?
- Since the first day of school.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:12.530
We're ever so sorry.

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:15.787
Most of us went to boarding school,
we don't really know any women.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.114
(RETCHING)

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.199
I'd like you to leave.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.543
How much was the bill?

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:26.544
For the table who left?

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:32.547
Um, maybe, £100 by the end of the night.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.554
- And we're spending what tonight?
- Ryle, just...

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.552
We're spending what tonight?

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.184
About three and a half grand, I think.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:47.519
It's not just about the money,

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:49.689
it's about goodwill,

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.572
these people are my customers.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:52.732
OK.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:55.781
Gesture of goodwill.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:59.491
We'll, um, we'll call it 150, all right?

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:01.575
Let's say they were going
to order another bottle.

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:04.335
We wouldn't want you to be out of pocket.

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:05.628
Exactly.

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:17.424
This is what they teach you
at boarding school, is it?

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:27.484
- Actually, yeah, it is.
- (LAUGHING)

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:29.812
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:49.122
Here we go.

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:51.629
Lovely!

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.823
I thought you were going to chuck them out.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.912
We came to an arrangement.

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:30.543
Did you let them pay you off?

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:34.593
All right, so, I let them reimburse me
for a table that we lost.

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:37.188
What? Would you rather that I just
didn't take money off people?

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.299
I'm still paying off
your student loan, you know.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.308
- Dad...
- Look, Rachel, if you've got comments,

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:45.312
just save them for after
service, all right?

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:51.018
Michael, I'll be behind
the bar if you need me.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.280
"Is that what they teach you
at boarding school?"

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:57.733
- (LAUGHING)
- I know. Knob-jockey.

01:02:57.816 --> 01:02:59.489
Come on. You offered him a deal,
he took it, what's the...

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:01.824
Yeah, but he keeps the moral high ground.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:05.449
What about, don't take the money
if you feel that fucking strongly?

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:08.160
Or what about, take the money,
but shut the fuck up?

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:10.875
Ryle, you're a fucking legend.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.332
And her, right, Charlie,

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:15.341
you're a prostitute,
love, get on your knees.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.298
Fuck ya!

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:21.803
I mean, are we just going to sit here
and take it, carry on taking it?

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.879
- We're all going to come out of college...
- Which we worked fucking hard for.

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:30.140
...and there's going to be no country left
for us because of people like him.

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:33.193
Oh, come on, that's a bit
of a hard line position, isn't it?

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:35.402
We never use those.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:39.232
<i>Buon appetito!</i>

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.866
OK, join it up, shall we?

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:49.125
So, OK, they want all the stuff,
nice car, massive telly,

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.795
so they borrow more than
they can ever afford to pay back.

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.748
- Yeah.
- Then, when the great New Labour

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:58.839
shop in the sky goes up in flames,
they vote us back in to sort it out.

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:02.931
Sounding a lot like a conversation
about politics here, can I just say?

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.634
State of the world, mate.
Everything's political.

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.765
- I'm here for the wine and the jokes.
- Hear, hear.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:10.772
Cos you've got no heritage, that's why.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:13.524
- I've got a boatload of heritage.
- No, mate, you've got a boat.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.820
Fuck you, Bellingfield.

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:19.648
You know, they're obsessed...

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:23.486
- They're obsessed with upward mobility.
- Absolutely.

01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:26.947
ALISTAIR: Don't understand why it doesn't
all just get handed to them.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.998
- Mate.
- No, fuck you.

01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:32.624
- Does anyone not want their pudding?
- JAMES: Is that why they're all so bitter?

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:36.585
I can't help who my father is, but every
fucking internship interview it comes up,

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:40.753
as if I haven't worked,
as if I don't work my fucking arse off!

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:44.139
- It's just them and us all over again.
- Yes!

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:46.842
No, it's not. It's not at all.
It's not them and us.

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:49.599
In our village pub, we drink with everyone.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:52.222
People who work in the estate, farmers.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.273
- Who buys the drinks?
- Sorry?

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:55.559
Who pays for the drinks?

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:58.186
Well, I do.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:03.196
You think they don't laugh at you
when you're not there?

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.405
George, they hate you.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:12.872
Fuck! Oh, that's nice.

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:15.166
All I need now is a blo-jo.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:18.215
Maybe we should just try and

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:20.917
find a way to, uh, co-exist.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:28.017
Mate, just cos you're doing field research
doesn't mean the rest of us want to.

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:31.056
We apologise.

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.852
We apologise for being who we are.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:38.860
We pretend we're the same,
we do it to ourselves, yeah?

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:41.863
We need to stop apologising.

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:44.115
Cos it's only going to get worse.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.659
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Shit! Um, lose it, lose the coke.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:49.703
Um, yep-

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.367
- Hi.
- Fuck!

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:00.298
What are you, uh, sorry, hi...

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.133
Um, what are you... What
are you doing here?

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.712
(CHUCKLES) You texted me?
You asked me to come.

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:09.758
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you texted me.

01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:11.384
Sorry, who are you?

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:13.348
Oh, it's Miles' girlfriend.

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:15.809
- Lauren Small!
- I didn't text you.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.850
No, I didn't fucking text her!
I didn't text you.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:22.112
Presumably, we could sort this out
quite easily by seeing the text?

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:24.360
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Very good point.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.779
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:29.452
- Jesus, just look at mine.
- Thank you.

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:32.910
Lauren...

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:38.412
"I need you to rescue me.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:43.671
"Can you put on a dress
and come to the Bull's Head, Kidsbury?

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.798
<i>"Kiss, kiss, kiss, Miles."</i>

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:50.098
Honestly, some fuckwit has
nicked my phone and texted you.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:52.805
You said you needed me and I came.

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:56.437
I think that makes me a nice person.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:58.314
It does, it does, you know.

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:00.517
Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.

01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:02.147
Um...

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:06.860
Uh, I'm sorry, Lauren.
But this is a mistake. So...

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.237
I think I'm gonna put you in a taxi...

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.993
No, no, no, she's only just arrived.
Where are your manners, Milo?

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:14.289
- Harry...
- Seriously, calm down, sit down.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.117
Lauren, please, have a drink.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:19.752
Here.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.752
Oh, this is nice.

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:29.467
So, now, Lauren,

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:33.596
my friend here has a question for you.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:37.978
Hi.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:41.478
Hello!

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:47.359
How would you like to make £300 tonight?

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:56.573
What?

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:59.705
Oh, my God, is he going to ask her? Legend.

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:00.910
You see...

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:05.833
We had this...

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:09.840
We had this lady friend, um, boo,

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.255
the landlord sent her away.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:15.137
- Guys, please, don't...
- What sort of lady friend?

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.551
- Service industry.
- Just a few blow jobs.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:22.357
- OK, it's my girlfriend, can you just stop?
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:26.520
I didn't realise you were,
you know, exclusive.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.689
What was it you said earlier?

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.947
"Girls for now, girls for later."

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.872
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.667
I didn't say that! I didn't say it!

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:46.581
Chaps, chaps.

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:50.131
I think that's a bit insulting
to Lauren, actually.

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:56.470
Three hundred quid?

01:08:56.549 --> 01:09:01.100
No, no, surely it should be something
that actually makes a difference?

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:03.648
- Like, um...
- Dimitri, please.

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:06.395
Twenty-seven grand?

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.613
What?

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.407
It's three years' tuition fees.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.743
Just for a few blow jobs.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:17.908
Spicy.

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:23.243
I'm serious.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:27.081
Give me your account number,
I will do a transfer right now.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:30.295
Miles?

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:34.091
- I, um...
- LAUREN: Yeah?

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:49.814
It's up to you.

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:51.979
Sorry?

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:56.026
No, no, no, you're right...

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.281
It's up to me?

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.990
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
I just thought for a second,

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:03.370
for a moment, I just thought
it's a fuckload of money.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.417
What, and I'm the sort of scrubber
who'd take it?

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:08.671
No, no, I didn't think
it was my decision to make.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.298
Um, can I get you a taxi?

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.422
(ALL CHUCKLING)

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:18.097
- Can you let me out, please?
- What is it, Lauren?

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:19.633
You're too good for us?

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:21.597
We've got the finest sperm
in the country in this room,

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.477
you should be paying us
to let you drink it.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.396
What are you saying? What are you doing?

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:27.189
Whoa, whoa, jokes. Lauren...

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:29.642
Jokes.

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:34.155
Do you not do humour at state school?

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:35.648
What?

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:39.034
You think we'd touch you with a bargepole?

01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:41.620
Wouldn't fuck her with a bargepole.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.531
(SHOUTING) That is fucking offensive.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:46.868
Let her out, guys.

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:47.952
Let her out.

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:51.664
Oh, no, sorry, it's, uh, it's pull.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.000
MILES: Stop it.

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:56.218
For fuck's sake, stop it.

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:01.507
Anyone else?

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:08.556
MILES: Lauren!

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:10.182
Lauren.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.706
You're wasted, you're wasted.

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.227
(DOOR OPENS)

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:08.916
Rach...

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:10.584
Rachel.

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:14.831
We'll talk about it in the morning, Dad.

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:27.514
Go help yourself to a pint if you want.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:29.971
Best get back, thanks,
the little one's teething.

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:33.029
Unless you need help handling those lads.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:35.898
What? No. I'll be fine.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:38.362
Go on, get home.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.189
See ya.

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:44.361
Go on, Paul, I'll empty that.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.993

This bourgeois outrage when

That's not sweat on their palms,

it's envy, it's resentment.

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.165

- That's right.

What, the newest member?

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:03.509
But we've got two new members.

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:05.056
Yeah, but technically
you only become a member

01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:07.263
once your room's trashed,
so it depends on which order we did that.

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.515
We did Ryle first, so technically...

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:12.309
Technically, it's Miles.

I'm not going to go in
there and say I did this.

01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:32.242
What the fuck?

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:33.326

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:46.848
We could all get sent down from college.

01:29:46.923 --> 01:29:49.472
Yes, and that's the worst possible thing
you can imagine happening, is it?

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:53.139
Miles, I have holes in my pockets
and no one useful on speed dial.

01:29:53.972 --> 01:29:55.189
I'm built for hiding in libraries.

01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:57.313
I'm not gonna lie to the police,
so you can ponce around

01:29:57.392 --> 01:30:00.192
- in a fucking cape for the rest of your life.
- JAMES: Thing is, mate,

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:02.906
it's nine against one.

01:30:04.566 --> 01:30:06.193
Whatever you say.

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:39.147
Can I, uh, speak to you?

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:42.028
- Somewhere not...
- I've got nothing to say.

01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:47.030
Please, I have to talk to you...

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:55.075
You let them humiliate me.

01:30:57.827 --> 01:30:59.170
I'm sorry.

01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:03.675
Really sorry.

01:31:04.668 --> 01:31:08.548
And I will do whatever you want
to prove that to you, but...

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:10.340
I need your help, something has happened...

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:12.422
Why should I help you
after what you put me through?

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:15.971
I didn't do what you think,
I tried to stop them...

01:31:16.054 --> 01:31:17.556
You were there.

01:31:18.181 --> 01:31:20.149
You had a choice, Miles.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:23.069
You chose to do nothing

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:27.695
and if you speak to me ever again,
I will report you,

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:30.485
all of you, for assault.

01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:32.321
Please...

01:31:58.388 --> 01:32:00.356
Alistair Ryle?

01:32:00.432 --> 01:32:01.604
Uh, no.

01:32:02.642 --> 01:32:04.269
This is his room?

01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:06.737
No, we, we swapped.

01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:11.948
He's in Cloister Quad, Walsingham,
number six, I think.

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.322
You got some ID?

01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:16.577
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:34.632 --> 01:32:36.384
Sorry to disturb you.

01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:38.516
No, it's fine. Thank you.

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:49.697
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:54.907
Alistair Ryle?

01:33:12.212 --> 01:33:14.840
They found bits of the landlord
under Ryle's fingernails.

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:15.924
Bits?

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:18.135
I don't know, skin and stuff. Skin.

01:33:18.176 --> 01:33:19.803
JAMES: And they've charged him?

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:20.845
HARRY: Yeah.

01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:22.680
Just him?

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:23.811
Yes.

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:26.430
And the rest of us pay a police fine
for the damage.

01:33:26.476 --> 01:33:27.728
No criminal record.

01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:29.131
JAMES: And do we trust Ryle to...

01:33:29.187 --> 01:33:31.155
Of course, we do. The man's a legend.

01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:33.983
And what about college?
Are we gonna be sent down?

01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:38.155
You're a fucking pussy, Leighton,
you know that?

01:33:51.918 --> 01:33:53.545
(BELL TOLLING)

01:34:00.135 --> 01:34:02.854
Were it up to me,
these boys would be sent down

01:34:02.887 --> 01:34:06.107
for moral vacuity and unspeakable
thoughtlessness.

01:34:07.058 --> 01:34:10.187
However, I have been outvoted.

01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:14.324
Since the police have decided
to prosecute only one of the boys,

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:18.154
the council of colleges doesn't feel
justified in removing all 10.

01:34:19.779 --> 01:34:22.373
Not with the roasting
we'd receive from the press.

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:26.119
Only Alistair Ryle is to be sent down.

01:34:27.745 --> 01:34:30.464
MILES' MOTHER: Oh well, that is, my gosh,

01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:32.922
that is very good news.

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:37.221
Time will tell if it was one bad apple
spoiling the rest.

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:39.636
MILES' MOTHER: Well, thank you.

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:44.729
Of course, if there's anything we can do
to say thank you to the college...

01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:50.435
Anything?

01:34:50.476 --> 01:34:51.477
No.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.704
MILES' FATHER: OK, Olly, let's go.

01:35:01.779 --> 01:35:04.282
Your marvellous brother's got away
with it this time.

01:35:04.324 --> 01:35:05.667
- What's that mean?
- MILES' FATHER: He stays.

01:35:05.742 --> 01:35:08.211
He's allowed back after the holidays.
Thank God.

01:35:08.286 --> 01:35:09.754
GUY: Richards, mate.

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:12.040
I was just coming to find you.

01:35:17.337 --> 01:35:18.338
Sorry.

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:21.262
Guy Bellingfield.

01:35:21.299 --> 01:35:23.427
Wonderful to meet you, I've heard so much.

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:27.601
MILES' FATHER: You're not a friend
from this club, are you?

01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:30.142
Uh, from the history society,

01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:31.898
Junior Historians.

01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:37.324
Actually, I'm the new president
of the Junior Historians.

01:35:37.357 --> 01:35:38.950
President?

01:35:38.983 --> 01:35:42.908
The previous incumbent was shown
not to be up to the job, so...

01:35:44.447 --> 01:35:48.827
I thought we could get together,
discuss next term's lecture series,

01:35:48.868 --> 01:35:50.836
if you fancy coming along.

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:56.668
Maybe, it's not for me.

01:35:57.835 --> 01:36:01.465
I'm done with societies.
I'll be fine on my own.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:03.758
But thanks.

01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:10.895
Well, good luck with that.

01:36:11.683 --> 01:36:13.981
(EXHALES) Um, good to meet you.

01:36:18.564 --> 01:36:21.238
Tubes, mate, club meeting.

01:36:21.859 --> 01:36:24.703
Operation Grasshopper, call me back, yeah?

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:57.562
JEREMY: Alistair. Good of you to come.

01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:59.272
Harry said you wanted to see me.

01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:01.232
Do you want some lunch?

01:37:01.941 --> 01:37:02.942
Yeah.

01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:13.586
You're with Johnny Drummond, right?

01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:16.081
ALISTAIR: Dad trusts him.

01:37:16.122 --> 01:37:19.797
He's a good lawyer.
What's he advising, self-defence?

01:37:19.876 --> 01:37:22.504
Landlord was carrying a knife, I hear.

01:37:23.087 --> 01:37:26.432
- We're going with "I was bullied into it".
- (MOBILE PHONE VIBRATING)

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:29.306
That the club scapegoated me,
which is pretty much the truth.

01:37:29.385 --> 01:37:33.265
Forgive me, but wouldn't it be better
if the club could be kept out of it?

01:37:35.641 --> 01:37:38.861
- I don't see how it could...
- Oh, with the right lawyer, certainly.

01:37:38.936 --> 01:37:40.233
I know a man,

01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:43.946
ex-member himself, very useful
at sorting out our scrapes over the years.

01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:47.241
I don't give a shit about the club.

01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:48.655
Smash it.

01:37:51.407 --> 01:37:52.954
It's a bunker, isn't it?

01:37:53.826 --> 01:37:56.750
Training up a generation
for a life in hiding.

01:37:56.788 --> 01:37:58.961
We're not in hiding.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.963
It's an adaptation.

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:03.261
We adapt to survive.

01:38:05.004 --> 01:38:09.475
The dinners are just the beginning,
a three-year initiation, if you like.

01:38:09.509 --> 01:38:12.683
Now, you might have lost your place
at college, but you're still in the club.

01:38:12.762 --> 01:38:14.856
You can't afford not to be.

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:18.268
Look, why don't you come and
spend some time in my office,

01:38:18.309 --> 01:38:19.526
see how we do things?

01:38:20.645 --> 01:38:22.818
I don't want anything handed
to me on a plate...

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:25.320
I'm not giving you a constituency.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.495
Maybe you've got it in you to
do something special one day.

01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:31.828
And I'd rather you be doing it
in my camp than someone else's.

01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:46.926
I'm not just offering you a better lawyer,
Alistair, I am offering you a future.

01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:58.891
Good.

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:09.118
You know Lord Riot did not
spell his name R-I-O-T,

01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:10.695
but R-Y-O-T?

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:13.372
Nothing to do with riotous behaviour.

01:39:15.032 --> 01:39:17.626
Still, thank God, eh?

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:20.376
Thank God someone made the switch.

01:39:20.413 --> 01:39:22.666
Could have just been a mistake.

01:39:22.707 --> 01:39:25.551
People like us don't make mistakes, do we?
