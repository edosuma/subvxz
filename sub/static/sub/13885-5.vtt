00:49.560 --> 00:51.391
Arnold?

00:53.240 --> 00:55.470
- Arnold!
- I'm here, Mother!

00:59.680 --> 01:03.468
Your father and I are terribly worried
about your progress at school.

01:03.680 --> 01:07.593
- Yes, Mother.
- You don't get the marks you're capable of.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.119
No, Mother.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.675
Well, I went to see the headmaster.

01:11.840 --> 01:17.551
He said it might be in your best interest
to be kept back in Junior D for another year.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.393
- Oh.
- Is that all you've got to say?

01:20.560 --> 01:25.714
Well, it is quite difficult to talk
when you're tied upside down to a tree.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.633
- Were you playing with Howard and Frank?
- Yes.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.075
Well, what on earth were you playing?

01:31.240 --> 01:36.314
I said it was a shame we hadn't got a swing.
They said they could make one.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.678
I didn't realise
they was going to make one out of me.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.556
Well, that's nice, darling. Anyway,
your father had a word with the headmaster,

01:46.720 --> 01:51.794
and we explained how we wanted you
to be a test pilot like your brother John,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.514
and how this could damage your chances.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.759
We got this this morning.
You realise how important this is?

01:58.920 --> 02:02.799
This decision could completely alter
the whole course of your life.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.118
Whoa! Welcome home, Ace!

02:28.320 --> 02:31.471
- Bless you, Spanners. Good to be home.
- How'd she behave?

02:31.680 --> 02:34.558
The lightship? Like a frolicking filly in a pasture.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.838
How you got that crate
to break the light barrier, I'll never know.

02:39.040 --> 02:43.272
Well, some might say
the devilishly brave and handsome pilot did it.

02:43.480 --> 02:47.678
Tsh-pshaw! Nonsense.
Any twit can hug the event horizon of a black hole,

02:47.840 --> 02:50.434
then loop-de-loop at twice the speed of light,

02:50.600 --> 02:54.593
then slam the engines into reverse
and blast out of an imploding nebula.

02:54.760 --> 02:58.719
It's you guys with the magic wrenches.
You break the records.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.434
You'll be going to this party, I suppose?

03:01.600 --> 03:07.755
Good God, no. Heroes' welcomes with
21-gun salutes send me to the land of Nod.

03:07.960 --> 03:11.350
I'll be in the mess with the engineering boys,
as usual.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.677
- See you there at 1900?
- See you later, Ace.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.351
What a guy!

03:19.520 --> 03:23.593
Ah, welcome home, son.
You've been in all of our prayers.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.870
Bless you, Padre. How's little Tommy?

03:26.080 --> 03:29.356
He's pulled through, thanks to you.

03:29.560 --> 03:33.189
Sitting by his bedside
day after day, night after night,

03:33.360 --> 03:35.920
holding his hand, reading him stories...

03:36.120 --> 03:40.875
You know me, Chaplain. Any old excuse
to get out of dinner with the Admiral.

03:41.080 --> 03:45.153
Listen, there's a bash in the mess.
It would mean a lot if you were there.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.312
- Thank you, son.
- 1900.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.436
What a guy!

03:51.640 --> 03:55.269
- Commander Arnold Rimmer reporting.
- So, you dog, you're back.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.994
Did you doubt it, with you to come back to?

03:58.160 --> 04:01.914
If only it were true. What are you doing lunchtime?

04:02.080 --> 04:04.116
- Not sure. Why?
- If you're interested,

04:04.280 --> 04:07.909
I'll be in my quarters, covered in maple syrup.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.355
Sorry, Mellie, I don't fraternise with staff.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.676
- I resign.
- I'll be there at 1300.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.277
- You're back.
- 'Fraid so.

04:17.440 --> 04:21.069
Thought you might be.
Rubber shares went up this morning.

04:22.240 --> 04:27.951
- You wanted to see me, Bongo?
- Heard of the dimension theory of reality?

04:28.120 --> 04:32.796
That there's an infinite number of parallel
universes where every possibility exists?

04:33.000 --> 04:37.278
It's along those lines. The basic tenet
states that for every decision that's made,

04:37.440 --> 04:40.352
the alternative decision
is played out in another reality.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.313
- So?
- The lab boys have created a drive

04:43.480 --> 04:45.550
that can break the speed of reality.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.150
Those boffins have hammered together
a crate that can cross dimensions?

04:49.320 --> 04:51.629
- When do I launch?
- It's a one-way ticket.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.758
- There's no coming back.
- I'm free at 1500.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.435
This is a prototype.
There's no way of knowing if it'll get there.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.797
- Where's there, exactly?
- You'll be in an alternative reality,

05:01.960 --> 05:04.554
a reality where there's another Arnold Rimmer.

05:04.720 --> 05:09.316
Some decision was made
where he went one way and you went the other.

05:09.480 --> 05:13.268
- He may be quite different to you.
- Sounds like quite a caper.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.749
You'll do it?

05:15.920 --> 05:20.630
I'm a test pilot in the Space Corps.
It's my job to do it.

05:22.120 --> 05:27.797
I know this probably won't interest you,
but I'd hate myself if I didn't suggest it...

05:28.000 --> 05:30.798
- Suggest what?
- If you're interested,

05:30.960 --> 05:35.556
I'll be in my quarters at lunchtime,
covered in taramasalata.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.955
Didn't know your bread was buttered that side.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.359
It isn't. I'm happily married.
A chap like you can turn a guy's head.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.674
I'm sorry, Bongo. Lunch is... on Mellie.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.077
Would it make any difference
if it was... hoummos?

05:53.800 --> 05:57.429
I'm sorry, Bongo. I'm strictly butter side up.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.989
Understood.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.310
What a guy!

06:07.960 --> 06:10.713
- God speed and bless you, son!
- All systems check.

06:10.880 --> 06:15.317
Let's get this kite up into the big black.
Ignition... Chocks away.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.833
Bye, Bongo. Bye, Spanners.
Bye, Padre. Bye, Mellie.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.874
Smoke me a kipper - I'll be back for breakfast.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.433
Bye, Ace!

06:53.440 --> 06:55.431
Lights!

06:58.320 --> 07:00.914
- What?
- What are you doing?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.389
- What am I doing?
- Yes.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.192
Just nipping down the cinema
to catch the midnight movie.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.351
- Dressed like that?
- Yeah.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.715
Going to see "Jaws".

07:14.000 --> 07:17.549
You're going fishing, aren't you?
That ocean planet we passed.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.998
- You're going without me.
- Come off it, man. Don't be ridiculous!

07:22.160 --> 07:25.152
Why are the lights on? Let's go before...

07:27.360 --> 07:30.352
- All three of you.
- What's he talking about?

07:30.520 --> 07:34.957
I dunno. For some reason, he's got
this crazy idea that we're all going fishing.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.635
- Fishing?!
- "Dear Rimmer, we have gone fishing

07:39.640 --> 07:41.915
"to that ocean planet we passed.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.157
"We tried to wake you. See you in three weeks. "

07:45.360 --> 07:47.999
Oh, please, sir! I had no choice.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.913
- Kryten!
- Why did you want to go without me?

07:51.120 --> 07:54.192
We didn't WANT to.
We thought it wasn't your scene.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.874
I mean, fishing. It's boring, isn't it?

07:57.080 --> 08:01.551
I love fishing! The glow of the dawn,
the line arcing into the water...

08:01.760 --> 08:04.638
That's why we didn't invite you. There's no fish.

08:04.840 --> 08:09.356
That, at least, is true, sir.
There's no marine life on the entire planet.

08:09.560 --> 08:14.156
We're just gonna sit out on Starbug,
dangle the rods over the side and chill out.

08:14.360 --> 08:18.069
I don't believe anybody would go fishing
where there's no fish.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.956
We used to do it all the time.
We used to go down the canal.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.157
We used to go condom fishing.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.790
I swear, one time I caught
this two-pound black ribbed nobbler!

08:30.000 --> 08:31.991
It was about that big!

08:34.400 --> 08:39.110
Why didn't you just say, "Dear Rimmer,
we're going fishing and don't want you to come"?

08:39.280 --> 08:42.431
- See? That's what I said we should say!
- Shh!

08:42.640 --> 08:45.757
What is it about me?
It's always the same old story.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.669
It's not easy to look in that mirror
and see a guy nobody likes.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.873
How do you think we feel?
We gotta look at it all day!

08:54.040 --> 08:57.157
Look, we just thought you wouldn't want to come.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.073
I try to be liked. God knows I try.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.593
I regale you with amusing stories of my time
in the Hammond Organ Owners' Society.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.796
You never laugh.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.832
I offer to talk you through my photo collection
of 20th-century telegraph poles.

09:15.800 --> 09:20.510
You've always got some excuse.
None of you like morris dancing.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.950
Would that break your hearts, once in a while,

09:23.120 --> 09:28.069
getting our knees in the air, the jingle
of bells, the clonk of wood on wood?

09:28.240 --> 09:30.879
Every time I suggest it, you pretend to be ill.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.150
You're wrong.
We just thought you wouldn't want to come.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.153
Now we know you do, great, you can come.

09:38.320 --> 09:43.269
The way you go on, it's like
we've been planning it for days. We haven't.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.032
- Really?
- Really.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.190
All right, I'll come. Holly?

09:48.400 --> 09:50.755
Oh, who woke him up?

09:57.560 --> 09:59.710
- Steady now, Kryten,
- Yes, sir,

09:59.920 --> 10:03.196
Best not to rush it and cause an accident, eh?

10:03.360 --> 10:06.432
I have passed my test. I am a qualified pilot.

10:06.600 --> 10:11.390
- Mind that star!
- That star is two light years away, sir.

10:11.600 --> 10:16.754
There's no percentage in being a boy racer.
OK, you passed your test... Mind that planet!

10:16.960 --> 10:18.996
- Which planet?
- That planet!

10:19.160 --> 10:22.118
That's the planet we're heading to, sir.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.037
Excellent. Plot an orbital course.
We'll be there in no time.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.028
- Yes, I have, sir.
- Yes, and get the second stage under way.

10:30.240 --> 10:34.313
- I already have done, sir.
- You haven't correlated the data, have you?

10:34.480 --> 10:38.359
- Yes, I have, sir.
- You know your trouble, Kryten?

10:38.560 --> 10:41.358
- What, sir?
- You're a git.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.310
Stupid...
Three weeks stuck with Captain Yawn.

10:45.520 --> 10:49.433
It wasn't my fault. We'd be OK
if you hadn't blown the gaff.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.870
Me? You woke him up.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.995
I could've sweet-talked my way out of it,
but you came blundering in.

10:57.160 --> 11:02.154
You are so two-faced. You haven't got the guts
to tell the dude nobody likes him.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.557
Oh, brilliant.
What am I supposed to say? "Excuse me.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.759
"You're as popular as a horny dog
at a Miss Lovely Legs competition"?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.349
That's what I'd do. I'd say...

11:12.520 --> 11:15.080
Hi, buddy! How's it goin'?

11:15.240 --> 11:18.676
Oh... I just had to get out. He's driving me nuts!

11:18.840 --> 11:21.832
I cannot stand front-seat drivers.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.469
Well, come on. We're on holiday!
Let's cheer things up a bit.

11:26.640 --> 11:31.077
How about some music?
I've brought my Hammond CDs with me.

11:31.240 --> 11:35.358
How about "Reggie Wilson
Plays The Lift Music Classics"?

11:35.520 --> 11:38.830
What about "Sounds
Of The Supermarket: 20 Shopping Greats"?

11:39.720 --> 11:42.473
Anyone seen the keys to the medical cabinet?

11:42.640 --> 11:47.668
I feel a sudden urge to suffocate myself
with a two-pound black ribbed nobbler.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.518
- Not Reggie Wilson, please, Rimmer.
- You don't like Reggie Wilson? What?!

11:52.680 --> 11:55.672
Not even "Pop Goes Delius"
or "Funking Up Wagner"?

11:56.560 --> 11:58.551
I prefer something slightly more melodious,

11:58.720 --> 12:03.157
like the death rattle of a man
suffering from terminal flatulence.

12:04.400 --> 12:09.872
Come on, you bores. Let's do something.
How about we all sing campfire songs?

12:10.040 --> 12:12.349
# Kumbaya, my Lord

12:12.520 --> 12:14.875
# Kumbaya... # Everyone. Kryten.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.349
# Kumbaya, Kum... #

12:17.560 --> 12:20.916
- Purple alert! Purple alert!
- What's a purple alert?

12:21.120 --> 12:26.353
It's not as bad as a red alert, but worse
than a blue alert. Kind of a mauve alert...

12:26.560 --> 12:30.394
Holly, wipe the rabid foam from your chin
and start again.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.793
There's some sort of disruption
to the time-fabric continuum.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.474
At least, I presume that's what it is.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.349
There's this big wibbly-wobbly swirly thing
headed straight towards us.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.270
- What is it?
- I don't know! It's following us!

12:44.440 --> 12:48.228
It's locked in on us. Something's coming out of it.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.034
It's going to hit us! Collision course!

12:53.600 --> 12:56.512
Emergency! Emergency!
Adopt crash procedure!

12:56.720 --> 12:59.154
- Where's the card?
- What card?

12:59.360 --> 13:01.920
The plastic card with the crash procedure on it!

13:02.120 --> 13:04.588
- Don't panic!
- It should be behind the seats.

13:04.760 --> 13:08.514
Shouldn't we sit behind a woman
clutching a baby? What's the drill?

13:08.720 --> 13:10.472
- I know.
- What?

13:10.680 --> 13:13.956
Sit down, tuck your head between your legs
and brace yourself.

13:14.120 --> 13:19.433
- Now what?
- Open the in-flight magazine and read.

13:19.640 --> 13:23.599
The articles act as a sedative.
Look at the contents list -

13:23.760 --> 13:27.070
"Salt - An Epicure's Delight",
"Classic Wines Of Estonia",

13:27.240 --> 13:29.834
"Flemish Weaving The Traditional Way"...

13:30.000 --> 13:32.753
Don't fight it, man. Let it take you.

13:32.960 --> 13:36.475
How can you be so mind-bogglingly flippant?
We're going to crash!

13:36.680 --> 13:41.549
Stay calm. The more relaxed you are,
the less likely you are to be injured.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.149
Good luck, everybody. Here it comes!

13:48.080 --> 13:50.196
"The Egyptians were great believers in salt... "

13:50.400 --> 13:54.996
"When most people think of classic wines,
they are unlikely to consider Estonian reds,

13:55.160 --> 13:59.312
"yet Estonian grapes
are among the fruitiest and most subtle... "

13:59.520 --> 14:02.353
"Since the 13th century,
Belgium has been the home

14:02.520 --> 14:06.559
"of some of the most remarkable weaving
to come out of Europe... "

14:23.960 --> 14:27.555
- Is everyone all right?
- Yes, thank God. I'm fine.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.557
Cat!

14:30.720 --> 14:33.473
It's bad, buddy. It's real bad.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.917
See what I mean?
Red with apricot. I look like a jerk!

14:41.080 --> 14:43.640
I'm bleeding an unfashionable colour!

14:43.800 --> 14:48.191
If I'd known, I'd have worn white.
It goes with anything.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.396
- Is anything broken?
- Yeah.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.199
The stitching's come away
and the lining's ripped.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.555
Somebody, please! Get me a tailor!

14:55.720 --> 15:00.953
Kryten, get the first aid box.
We have to make sure he doesn't get gangrene.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.588
Gangrene? You think I might get gangrene?

15:03.760 --> 15:06.228
- Yeah. Shh!
- Hey, that might work!

15:06.400 --> 15:09.039
Green with apricot - I could pull that off!

15:11.200 --> 15:14.033
It's a break, sir. Quite a bad one.

15:14.200 --> 15:18.796
I'll have to snap the bone back into line,
and there's no anaesthetic.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.389
Here. Read the in-flight magazine.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.559
"Salt - An Epicure's Delight. The salt on a typ... "

15:24.760 --> 15:27.638
Oooh! My God!

15:27.840 --> 15:30.354
- Did it hurt?
- No, it's the article.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.715
Have you done my leg yet?

15:32.920 --> 15:36.629
- Holly, what's the damage?
- It doesn't look good.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.475
We've lost the port engine, the fuel line's severed,

15:40.640 --> 15:43.837
we're taking in water, half the electric's out,

15:44.040 --> 15:46.190
and the elastic's snapped on the furry dice.

15:46.840 --> 15:52.551
- What does that mean in real terms?
- Well, you've got a more tasteful cockpit,

15:52.720 --> 15:56.918
but unless you fix that starboard engine
within 40 minutes, we start sinking.

15:57.120 --> 16:01.398
- Anything we can do?
- Hire a dance band to play "Abide With Me"?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.639
I'll have to go and fix the engine.

16:04.840 --> 16:10.312
- You don't know anything about engines.
- Besides, there's a 40-knot gale out there.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.233
Only a fool or a hero would even consider it.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.200
Bingo! Down there.
They've ditched into the drink.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.716
- I'm bailing out, Computer!
- But, Ace, it's suicide!

16:22.880 --> 16:25.713
I caused the smash, should apologise.
Only manners.

16:25.880 --> 16:29.634
- Bring her around for another pass.
- Ace, don't go, I love you,

16:29.800 --> 16:34.476
Stiff upper modem, old girl.
Smoke me a kipper - I'll be back for breakfast.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.514
Name's Commander Rimmer.
Arnold Rimmer. Friends call me "Ace".

16:50.720 --> 16:53.439
I've come from another dimension. Explain later.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.791
First, let's get out of this pit.
What do they call you, matey?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.834
- Uh... Kryten, sir.
- Series 4,000 mechanoid, am I right?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.719
Salt of the Space Corps.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.551
- Spanners.
- Eh?

17:05.760 --> 17:08.433
Sorry, you reminded me of someone.
What's your handle?

17:08.599 --> 17:11.830
- Lister. Dave Lister.
- Of course. Put it there, Dave.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.358
You look like a great bloke.
What about the guy in the sharp suit?

17:16.520 --> 17:18.511
We just call him Cat.

17:18.680 --> 17:22.468
Bought yourself a broken leg, Cat.
Love the Cuban heels.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.069
Who's the stunningly gorgeous computer?

17:25.280 --> 17:27.271
Holly.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.279
God, it's me, only much more handsome.

17:32.480 --> 17:36.155
Well, I'm superfluous.
Arnie'll have you out of here in no time!

17:36.360 --> 17:41.354
- He's a hologram. He can't touch anything.
- Dead, eh? Commiserations, old man.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.711
- What a crushing bore that must be.
- You're me?

17:44.880 --> 17:48.429
Don't quite understand.
It's to do with us living identical lives

17:48.600 --> 17:53.799
up until a decision was made
and you went one way, I went the other.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.595
Still, can't hang around chinwagging.
Let's get this box airborne.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.911
- What's your plan, Arn?
- I... haven't got one.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.954
OK. Right. Well, um...

18:06.120 --> 18:10.238
I suggest this - the engine is repairable,
but it's a two-man job. Any volunteers?

18:10.440 --> 18:13.910
Yeah, OK. I've got a window
in my schedule this afternoon.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.635
Not so fast, Davy. You didn't give Arnie a chance.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.469
- He was about to volunteer, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.434
OK, well, um... let's get cracking, shall we, Dave?

18:25.640 --> 18:28.279
What's the starboard engine's
thrust-to-input ratio, Arn?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.908
- What's that?
- Well, you can work it out.

18:31.080 --> 18:34.550
- What's the craft's inertia rating?
- I don't know.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.950
- Well, what's the PSI?
- I don't know!

18:38.080 --> 18:42.835
OK, we'll work it out. Come on, Dave.
Better grab a brolly. There's a drizzle.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.791
- Sir, can I have a word in private?
- Of course, old friend. Excuse us.

18:55.720 --> 18:59.508
- What's the prob, Kryters?
- I have a limited understanding of medicine,

18:59.680 --> 19:03.912
but it's plainly obvious
that your left arm is broken in several places.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.315
Took a tumble. Only a scratch.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.990
I cannot allow you to go out in that condition.

19:10.160 --> 19:14.039
- You must allow me to go in your place.
- I see.

19:14.200 --> 19:18.398
- The Series 4,000 isn't waterproof, is it?
- That's besides the point, sir.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.596
Look, I'll tell you what we'll do...

19:22.680 --> 19:24.352
Sorry, no option.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.315
Arnie, Kryten's taken a bit of a whack.
Bring him back on-line.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.637
- How?
- You don't know how to do that?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.273
No.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.557
Come on, Dave. Let's get some fresh air.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.991
Smoke me a kipper... Can you do that?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.350
I'll be back for breakfast.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.320
- What's your favourite music, Dave?
- Eh?

20:02.520 --> 20:07.196
Keeps your spirits up if you sing a song.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.430
- I like rastabilly skank.
- Right.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.477
Aaaah!

20:11.640 --> 20:15.952
Grab my arm, Dave! Grab my arm!

20:19.000 --> 20:23.994
'Fraid I'm going to have to do
something a bit sissy now - black out.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.355
Sorry about that. Let's get cracking!

20:29.800 --> 20:35.158
# Whether you like rastabilly... #
Go on, Dave! Sing that song!

20:35.360 --> 20:37.510
# Whether you like rastabilly... #

20:39.280 --> 20:42.317
Paisley with stripes... That's nice...

20:43.360 --> 20:47.831
Green anoraks with furry collars... They're great!

20:48.040 --> 20:49.837
Oh, sir! He's delirious!

20:50.040 --> 20:56.559
Oh! Rubber trousers,
held down with bicycle clips... Wow!

20:56.760 --> 21:00.196
"Commander Rimmer. " I ask you.

21:00.360 --> 21:06.310
"Ace. " Barf city!
I bet he wears women's underwear.

21:06.760 --> 21:12.471
They're all the same, his type - hurly-burly,
rough-and-tumble macho marines in public,

21:12.640 --> 21:16.189
and behind closed doors,
he parades around in ball gowns

21:16.360 --> 21:18.715
drinking mint juleps, whipping the houseboy.

21:18.920 --> 21:23.471
Sir, he's you! It's just that your lives
diverged at a certain point in time.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.910
I went into the gents, he went the other way.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.356
I assume you are making
fatuous references to his sexuality.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.114
- May I point out...?
- Yes! We did it!

21:32.320 --> 21:36.598
Awooga, awooga, awah, awah!
Awooga, awooga, awah!

21:36.800 --> 21:39.519
What a team! How you did it, I'll never know.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.792
Come on, Ace, it was you!
You reconnected that fuel line.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.675
- Only because you held my ankles.
- How could you hang upside down

21:46.880 --> 21:49.519
AND fix the starboard engine?!

21:49.680 --> 21:52.717
- What a team!
- I know where I've seen you two.

21:52.920 --> 21:57.072
Weren't you the centrefold
in July's issue of "Big Boys In Boots"?

21:57.280 --> 22:01.990
Say what you like about me,
but I won't hear a word against Skipper.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.270
- "Skipper"?!
- He deserves a nickname.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.954
- "Skipper" sat rather well.
- "Ace" and "Skipper"?!

22:07.160 --> 22:11.358
You sound like a kids' TV series
about a boy and his bush kangaroo!

22:11.560 --> 22:16.953
Don't listen to him, Skipper. Let's get this
tea chest back to the small rouge one, eh?

22:17.160 --> 22:23.030
Yeah, so you two can have a nice hot
soapy bath and play "spot the submarine".

22:24.600 --> 22:27.910
Sir, the Cat -
I don't think he's going to last much longer!

22:33.480 --> 22:37.393
Bri-nylon underwear... Sock suspenders...

22:37.560 --> 22:41.155
- Suits with cardigans!
- Sir, he's delirious! His leg's all swollen.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.118
- He may lose it.
- Lose his leg?

22:44.280 --> 22:47.511
I fear so. The operation is beyond my expertise.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.353
Lose my leg? Hey, that's terrible.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.875
None of my suits will fit!

22:53.840 --> 22:57.799
Kryten, I'll need 500ccs
of corticoadrenaline, two pints of plasma,

22:57.960 --> 23:01.157
a laser scalpel and some kind of tissue sample.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.271
Oh, my God.

23:03.480 --> 23:08.474
Field microsurgery - part of basic training
in the Special Service. I'll go scrub up.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.989
I'll go and throw up.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.199
- How's the Cat?
- Oh, Ace did it.

23:18.360 --> 23:22.035
Cat's fine now. He's sitting in bed
looking through some swatches,

23:22.200 --> 23:25.158
trying to find material he likes for his dressings.

23:25.320 --> 23:30.314
I don't know how Ace does it.
He's been awake 36 hours. He's still joking.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.153
What a guy.

23:33.320 --> 23:36.835
He's teaching Kryten how to play the piano.
Amazing dude.

23:37.640 --> 23:41.872
So, is it a simple registry office
or a full church do?

23:42.080 --> 23:44.196
I don't understand your attitude. He's you!

23:44.400 --> 23:49.872
He's not me! I'm me! He's a me
who had all the chances that I never got.

23:50.040 --> 23:54.750
No, it was just a single incident,
and your lives went off in different directions.

23:54.960 --> 23:59.192
It's incredible to think that one decision
could produce such different people.

23:59.360 --> 24:04.229
Right. He probably went to some really great
school, while I was lumbered with lo House.

24:04.440 --> 24:08.672
He met all the right people,
greased his way up the old boy network,

24:08.880 --> 24:12.873
towel-flicked his way into the Space Corps,
Masonic-handshook his way into flight school

24:13.080 --> 24:15.878
and brown-tongued his way up the ranks.

24:16.080 --> 24:21.234
You'd think you'd be pleased that in another
dimension there's another you doing well.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.750
How would you feel if some git
arrived from another dimension,

24:24.920 --> 24:30.278
another Lister, with wall-to-wall charisma
and a PhD in being handsome and wonderful?

24:30.480 --> 24:33.074
Hey, man, I AM that Lister!

24:34.000 --> 24:37.436
No, how would you feel if there
was another Lister doing better than you?

24:37.640 --> 24:41.553
There is. Ace knows him.
That's why he called me Spanners.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.280
In Ace's dimension, he's a flight engineer,

24:44.440 --> 24:47.750
married to Kristine Kochanski,
twin boys, Jim and Bexley.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.993
I made up for him.
Whatever he did that I didn't, he deserves it.

24:52.160 --> 24:57.632
For me, it makes sense of stuff,
to think that every possibility is played out.

24:57.800 --> 25:01.679
There's probably a really weird dimension
where you're better-looking than me.

25:02.760 --> 25:06.753
Well, it makes me bitter.
You know I never got the breaks.

25:06.920 --> 25:10.959
Well, there's living proof
of what I could have achieved.

25:11.120 --> 25:15.671
- Skipper, got a mo?
- Go on. He's probably picked a ring.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.920
Skipper, I've decided I'm not going to stay.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.390
- Why?
- Him and me. It would never work.

25:28.560 --> 25:33.759
I can't stand the man. To see myself so
warped, bitter, weaselly. The man's a maggot.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.473
- So where are you going to go?
- Just out there.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.950
I can't go back,
but there's a billion realities to explore,

25:41.120 --> 25:43.350
a billion other Arnold Rimmers to meet.

25:43.520 --> 25:47.195
Maybe there's one
who's more of a pain than him... but I doubt it.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.153
Well, good luck. Don't be too hard on Rimmer.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.550
You got the break, he didn't.

25:53.760 --> 26:00.108
Do you know what that break was?
Aged seven, one of us was kept back a year.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.714
Put your finger on that, will you, Skipper?

26:02.880 --> 26:06.589
That's the only difference?
Rimmer went down a year?

26:06.760 --> 26:10.469
No, I was the one who went down a year.

26:11.120 --> 26:16.672
By his terms, he got the break,
but being kept down a year made me.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.628
The humiliation -
being tallest in the class by a clear foot -

26:21.480 --> 26:25.632
it changed me,
made me buckle down, made me fight back.

26:26.120 --> 26:30.113
- I've been fighting back ever since.
- While he spent his life making excuses.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.797
Maybe he's right. Maybe I did get the lucky break.

26:34.960 --> 26:39.909
I'll be off, Dave. Smoke me a kipper, Skipper -
I'll be back for breakfast.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.397
Ready?

26:58.560 --> 27:00.869
I'll smoke him a smegging kipper.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.592
Now!

27:38.240 --> 27:41.869
It's Wednesday night,
It's amateur Hammond organ recital night,

27:42.040 --> 27:44.031
OK, take it away, skutters!
