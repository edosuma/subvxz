WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:01.527
My name
is Michael Westen.

00:01.612 --> 00:03.695
I used to be
a spy until...

00:04.280 --> 00:05.330
We got a burn notice on you.

00:05.415 --> 00:07.282
You're blacklisted.

00:07.333 --> 00:09.618
When you're burned,
you've got nothing.

00:09.669 --> 00:11.920
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:11.988 --> 00:14.256
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.323 --> 00:16.658
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.710 --> 00:18.994
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.045 --> 00:21.163
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you...

00:22.682 --> 00:23.632
A trigger-happy girlfriend...

00:23.683 --> 00:25.050
Should we shoot them?

00:25.135 --> 00:27.052
An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:27.137 --> 00:29.772
You know spies--
bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.839 --> 00:31.173
Family too...

00:31.224 --> 00:32.941
- Hey, is that your mom again?
- If you're desperate.

00:33.009 --> 00:35.027
Someone needs your help,
Michael.

00:35.111 --> 00:37.229
And a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.

00:37.313 --> 00:38.814
That's how we do it,
people.

00:38.865 --> 00:41.533
Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,

00:41.618 --> 00:43.485
you're not going anywhere.

00:46.456 --> 00:49.157
Michael Westen,
welcome back to the CIA.

00:49.208 --> 00:51.493
Your mission
is a deep-cover job

00:51.544 --> 00:53.128
going after the leader
of a terrorist network.

00:53.179 --> 00:54.780
I am the man
you've been waiting to meet.

00:54.797 --> 00:57.299
This is where we learn if you
are the man you say you are.

00:57.350 --> 00:58.967
I've done everything
you've asked of me.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.502
That should count
for something.

01:00.553 --> 01:01.937
I'll tell you
whatever you want to know.

01:02.004 --> 01:04.438
Yes, you will.
Shall we begin?

01:06.175 --> 01:08.727
When were you recruited by
the Central Intelligence Agency?

01:08.811 --> 01:11.530
Who was your training officer?

01:13.566 --> 01:17.869
Your career is marked
with an extraordinary degree

01:17.954 --> 01:19.020
of loyalty.

01:19.072 --> 01:21.373
Old loyalties die hard,

01:21.457 --> 01:25.026
and I need to know
that you've left yours behind.

01:25.078 --> 01:27.245
- You won't pull that trigger.
- Why?

01:27.330 --> 01:29.998
Because I'm here,
and I have nothing to hide.

01:30.049 --> 01:32.534
A man who has no secrets

01:32.585 --> 01:33.835
can trust himself.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.554
I'm glad
you're that kind of man.

01:35.638 --> 01:38.173
I'm James.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.810
Where is James Kendrick?

01:41.877 --> 01:43.395
That's his last name?
Kendrick?

01:43.479 --> 01:44.646
Do you want to know
why I've been rotting

01:44.713 --> 01:47.983
in a mental institution
for the past 15 years?

01:48.050 --> 01:50.185
Because that bastard
put me there.

01:50.236 --> 01:51.719
This new asset
is a Delta too.

01:51.771 --> 01:52.938
Peter Millard.

01:53.022 --> 01:55.107
He was
in James's Special Forces unit,

01:55.191 --> 01:57.025
disappeared the same time
James did.

01:57.076 --> 02:00.278
I loved that man,
and he led me straight to Hell.

02:02.582 --> 02:05.917
Working a long-term
undercover job is about learning

02:06.002 --> 02:07.402
to live with uncertainty--

02:07.453 --> 02:09.871
the uncertainty that comes
with chasing

02:09.922 --> 02:12.591
something you can never see.

02:12.675 --> 02:14.960
You're often going
after a target you know

02:15.044 --> 02:16.678
little or nothing about.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.430
I see that look
in your eye.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.132
This James guy,
he's getting to you.

02:20.216 --> 02:22.467
They all are.
I know.

02:22.552 --> 02:23.852
You don't know their plans.

02:23.919 --> 02:27.055
You don't know
where they'll be.

02:27.106 --> 02:29.191
You don't know
what they know about you.

02:29.258 --> 02:33.228
Tell me, do you know
how far James is willing to go?

02:33.279 --> 02:36.264
- I think I'm starting to.
- I doubt it.

02:36.315 --> 02:37.782
After a while,
that uncertainty

02:37.867 --> 02:39.267
begins to gnaw at you.

02:39.318 --> 02:42.937
It affects you, no matter
how well-trained you are.

02:42.989 --> 02:44.322
What did he do?

02:44.407 --> 02:45.907
He killed them all.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.076
The whole unit.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.711
Slit their throats
while they were sleeping.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.797
The real battle becomes
the one within yourself,

02:52.882 --> 02:54.166
to keep your doubts at bay.

02:54.250 --> 02:55.967
You think you can stop him?

02:56.052 --> 02:57.785
No one can stop him.

02:57.837 --> 02:58.877
So that when the day comes

02:58.921 --> 03:03.258
to take your target down...

03:03.309 --> 03:05.844
You're ready.

03:10.466 --> 03:12.651
Can I help you?

03:12.735 --> 03:16.771
James has asked
that you come with us.

03:18.491 --> 03:19.807
What's this about?

03:19.859 --> 03:22.410
We're not at liberty
to discuss that, sir.

03:22.478 --> 03:25.113
We'll need your gun
and your phone.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.082
Please.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:59.315 --> 04:02.150
Head in through those doors.

04:07.740 --> 04:10.542
Keep walking.

04:25.141 --> 04:26.391
Hey, Mike.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.709
Want to tell us
what the hell is happening?

04:27.760 --> 04:28.893
I don't know, Sam.

04:28.978 --> 04:31.012
I was with your mother
and Charlie

04:31.063 --> 04:32.814
when they dragged me off.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.232
They took away
your phone and gun too?

04:34.317 --> 04:37.102
Yeah, they did.

04:39.655 --> 04:40.905
Okay, I'm just gonna say
what we're all thinking.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.742
What if James didn't bring us
here to talk?

04:43.826 --> 04:46.067
Maybe it's time to start
game-planning a way out of here.

04:46.078 --> 04:49.614
If I could get my hands
on one of those...

04:49.699 --> 04:53.001
We are outnumbered
three to one.

04:53.068 --> 04:55.587
Besides, if this
was an execution,

04:55.671 --> 04:57.071
we'd be dead already.

04:57.123 --> 04:58.840
So we're just supposed
to trust this guy?

04:58.907 --> 05:00.542
You're supposed
to trust me, Sam.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.210
Midas is moving.

05:02.261 --> 05:05.797
All units,
Midas is moving.

05:05.881 --> 05:08.266
All exits secure.

05:08.351 --> 05:09.768
James, what the hell
is going on?

05:09.852 --> 05:11.636
You ask us here
without a moment's notice,

05:11.721 --> 05:15.690
no communication,
no warning.

05:15.758 --> 05:18.943
I needed
to talk to you.

05:19.028 --> 05:22.614
I apologize if my arrangements
caused you any anxiety.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.366
Security precautions.
Couldn't be helped.

05:24.433 --> 05:27.902
You could have just told us
where to meet you.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.455
Well, a man in my position
doesn't last very long

05:30.539 --> 05:32.273
by announcing where he's going
in advance.

05:32.325 --> 05:33.575
I understand that,

05:33.626 --> 05:35.327
but what were we
supposed to think?

05:35.411 --> 05:38.613
I'm not concerned
with what you think.

05:38.664 --> 05:41.783
I'm concerned with what you do,
and you all did fine.

05:41.834 --> 05:44.552
So this was a test?

05:44.620 --> 05:46.260
We may not have worked
together that long,

05:46.288 --> 05:48.956
but you should know by now
everything's a test, Michael.

05:49.008 --> 05:51.945
Now, lady, gentlemen,
we have a lot to discuss.

05:51.946 --> 05:55.946
<font color=#00FF00>Burn Notice 7x09</font>

06:00.948 --> 06:02.854
I want to thank you
for bearing with me on this.

06:02.855 --> 06:04.473
Normally I like to do
this sort of thing

06:04.557 --> 06:06.090
in a more civilized fashion.

06:06.142 --> 06:09.060
We needed a team in Miami
in a hurry.

06:09.112 --> 06:11.396
You're it.
James, what is this about?

06:11.447 --> 06:12.597
Is it a job?

06:12.648 --> 06:15.233
Michael, waiting tables
is a job.

06:15.284 --> 06:16.735
Digging ditches,
that is a job.

06:16.786 --> 06:18.120
This is more than a job.

06:18.204 --> 06:20.956
A man is gonna be assassinated
in the next 24 hours,

06:21.040 --> 06:23.992
and I want to make sure
that that doesn't happen.

06:24.076 --> 06:25.710
That's the man
you'll be protecting.

06:25.778 --> 06:27.829
His name is Omar Hamed.

06:27.914 --> 06:29.664
He's one of the lead reformers
in the Middle East.

06:29.749 --> 06:31.666
He is the lead reformer.

06:31.751 --> 06:34.336
He ran the Tripoli Peace Accords
last year, among other things.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.388
Now this Hamed,
is he one of yours?

06:36.455 --> 06:37.639
Has no idea we exist,

06:37.723 --> 06:39.307
but if he dies,
there will be a war.

06:39.392 --> 06:41.259
And let's just say that a war

06:41.310 --> 06:43.762
would affect our interests.

06:43.813 --> 06:46.982
This is Ben Snyder,
one of my most senior men.

06:47.066 --> 06:48.517
He'll be running this Op.

06:48.601 --> 06:50.986
These men are with a Libyan
radical group with local ties.

06:51.070 --> 06:53.488
Last week, they got a shipment
of MP5s, an SUV,

06:53.573 --> 06:55.139
and orders to kill Hamed

06:55.191 --> 06:56.975
at the economic development
conference downtown.

06:57.026 --> 06:57.943
Does he know
he's being targeted?

06:57.994 --> 06:59.411
Unfortunately no,

06:59.478 --> 07:01.746
and we can't risk compromising
our sources on this.

07:01.814 --> 07:03.031
So what's your plan
to protect him?

07:03.115 --> 07:05.083
Ben.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.317
I've arranged
with the company

07:06.369 --> 07:07.419
handling security
for the conference,

07:07.486 --> 07:09.320
and Westen and Axe
are gonna be

07:09.372 --> 07:10.989
on Hamed's
security detail.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.257
Glenanne and Porter

07:12.324 --> 07:14.376
will work with me
on the perimeter

07:14.460 --> 07:16.595
starting tomorrow
at 9:00 a.m.

07:16.662 --> 07:19.297
Ben is
our Middle East expert,

07:19.348 --> 07:21.299
and this is
his first field Op.

07:21.350 --> 07:22.634
Now there's no reason
to be nervous, Ben.

07:22.685 --> 07:25.387
You up for this?
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:25.471 --> 07:26.888
Good.
Then let's get started.

07:26.973 --> 07:30.141
Now that is assuming
that you're all in.

07:34.346 --> 07:36.731
Yeah, we're in.

07:36.816 --> 07:38.817
I don't know who these men are
you're working with,

07:38.868 --> 07:40.819
but Charlie was in the house

07:40.870 --> 07:42.191
when they came
to take Fiona away.

07:42.238 --> 07:44.355
- I know, Mom. I'm sorry.
- There's a worse part.

07:44.407 --> 07:45.490
Do you want to hear
the worst part?

07:45.541 --> 07:47.358
We weren't even
supposed to be here.

07:47.410 --> 07:50.161
I was supposed to be at a
meeting at Charlie's preschool.

07:50.213 --> 07:53.632
A meeting that, by the way,
happened to get cancelled.

07:53.699 --> 07:55.383
The people you work for
arranged to have

07:55.468 --> 07:57.502
my meeting cancelled,
so I'd be home

07:57.553 --> 08:00.255
and then Fiona would come over
and visit like she usually does

08:00.339 --> 08:03.091
on Thursdays and they could come
and pick her up right here!

08:04.927 --> 08:07.596
What kind of people
are these, Michael?

08:07.680 --> 08:10.765
Use a three-year-old
little boy.

08:10.850 --> 08:13.068
Mom, that's not something
I can talk about.

08:13.152 --> 08:15.053
Oh, really?

08:15.104 --> 08:16.554
Well, you're gonna have
to talk about it.

08:16.606 --> 08:19.157
How did they know?

08:19.224 --> 08:22.994
How did they know
my schedule or Fiona's?

08:23.062 --> 08:24.996
How did they know
when to call?

08:25.064 --> 08:28.700
They were probably
watching you.

08:28.751 --> 08:31.903
Oh, really?
And that's okay with you?

08:31.954 --> 08:34.839
No, it's not okay.
It's just--

08:37.092 --> 08:41.429
it's just a fact of life
right now.

08:41.514 --> 08:44.382
You know,
sometimes, Michael,

08:44.433 --> 08:47.752
people get
used to the wrong things.

08:47.803 --> 08:50.588
I can't afford to do that.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.223
Not anymore.

08:52.275 --> 08:54.476
I've got Charlie.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.311
Just let it go.

08:56.395 --> 08:59.648
I can't do that anymore,
Michael.

08:59.732 --> 09:03.985
You do whatever it is
you have to do.

09:04.070 --> 09:07.322
And I will do
whatever I have to do.

09:16.448 --> 09:19.250
Some people say that democracy
is a Western idea,

09:19.302 --> 09:22.220
that it is incompatible

09:22.287 --> 09:24.306
with the Middle Eastern way
of life.

09:24.390 --> 09:27.976
Personal security uses
a method called "arm's reach."

09:28.060 --> 09:29.594
In an attack,
if you're closest

09:29.645 --> 09:32.130
to the client,
you shield them.

09:32.181 --> 09:33.815
If you're closest
to the attacker,

09:33.899 --> 09:35.900
you focus on the threat.

09:35.968 --> 09:38.469
One man tries to defend
against danger,

09:38.521 --> 09:42.657
and the other one
tries to find it.

09:42.742 --> 09:45.910
Of course, if personal security
has to get involved,

09:45.978 --> 09:48.029
something's already gone
very wrong.

09:49.699 --> 09:51.315
A good security setup

09:51.367 --> 09:53.535
stops threats
before they ever get close.

09:53.619 --> 09:55.170
With a combination
of human spotters,

09:55.254 --> 09:57.839
computerized facial recognition,

09:57.923 --> 10:00.258
and electronic
surveillance equipment,

10:00.325 --> 10:02.877
the goal is to find
the bad guys

10:02.962 --> 10:04.328
long before they make a move.

10:04.380 --> 10:05.380
We're all clear out here.

10:05.381 --> 10:06.881
And cell phone activity

10:06.966 --> 10:08.717
isn't picking up
any red flags.

10:08.801 --> 10:10.935
See anything, Westen?
No. All clear.

10:11.003 --> 10:14.839
Plant the seeds
of an everlasting peace.

10:14.890 --> 10:17.442
Thank you.

10:17.509 --> 10:20.562
He's on the move.
Let's stay sharp.

10:38.363 --> 10:41.249
This reception should last
about an hour.

10:41.333 --> 10:42.700
If you gentlemen would like

10:42.752 --> 10:44.753
to grab something to eat
in the meantime...

10:44.837 --> 10:46.037
Thank you, sir,
but we're fine.

10:46.038 --> 10:47.318
Sir, please don't worry
about us.

10:47.339 --> 10:48.673
Anything you need,
we're right here.

10:48.724 --> 10:51.593
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

10:53.896 --> 10:55.146
Too bad.

10:55.214 --> 10:56.694
Those hors d'oeuvres
are looking good.

10:56.732 --> 10:58.382
Did you see those crab cakes?
Let's get through this, Sam.

10:58.434 --> 10:59.434
Just one more hour,
and I'll buy you

10:59.518 --> 11:00.735
all the crab cakes you want.

11:00.820 --> 11:03.688
Hey, fair warning,
that could get pricey.

11:05.157 --> 11:06.441
Okay, just checking in.

11:06.525 --> 11:07.942
We're not seeing
any hit teams out here.

11:08.027 --> 11:10.195
Not even seeing any Libyans.

11:10.246 --> 11:12.030
Keep looking. My intelligence
on this is solid.

11:12.081 --> 11:13.581
They'll be there.

11:13.666 --> 11:16.734
Look, I know it's been a while
since you've been in the field,

11:16.786 --> 11:17.902
but maybe security
scared 'em off.

11:17.953 --> 11:19.537
No one's been in
for two hours.

11:19.588 --> 11:21.089
This thing should be over
pretty soon.

11:21.173 --> 11:22.457
When are we off duty here?

11:22.541 --> 11:24.242
When's Hamed
officially dodged the bullet?

11:24.293 --> 11:25.593
When the mission is done.

11:25.678 --> 11:27.295
We just need to get him
safely to the airport,

11:27.379 --> 11:28.463
and then
the U.N. security will--

11:29.765 --> 11:31.132
Will what?
Snyder, everything okay?

11:31.217 --> 11:33.251
Jesus, I think
we have something.

11:33.302 --> 11:35.437
Something?
What kind of something?

11:35.521 --> 11:36.754
How about a little detail
here?

11:36.806 --> 11:38.606
Just give me a minute!

11:38.691 --> 11:41.643
It's an encrypted phone call
coming from inside the hotel.

11:41.727 --> 11:43.761
Can you pinpoint
the signal?

11:43.813 --> 11:46.731
I can triangulate the towers
down to 1,000 feet.

11:46.782 --> 11:47.982
Do you see anything?

11:48.067 --> 11:49.934
There's lots
of convention folks

11:49.985 --> 11:52.871
talking on phones.
Could be any one of 'em.

11:57.993 --> 11:59.410
Sam, there.

11:59.462 --> 12:01.463
- Where?
- 12:00.

12:01.547 --> 12:04.448
Server with an earpiece.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.218
He seems very interested
in our guy too.

12:07.286 --> 12:09.053
He could be calling in
a location for a hit.

12:09.121 --> 12:11.306
Get Hamed
to a secure area.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.974
Excuse me, sir,
sorry to interrupt.

12:13.058 --> 12:14.926
You need to come
with me right now.

12:14.977 --> 12:15.844
- What's going on?
- No time to explain.

12:15.928 --> 12:19.264
It's for your own safety.

12:19.315 --> 12:21.632
He's running, Sam.
Get Hamed out of here now.

12:21.684 --> 12:24.635
I have a target running
through the laundry room

12:24.687 --> 12:25.987
towards the service elevator.

12:26.071 --> 12:28.306
I see him. He's moving
towards the east exit.

12:28.357 --> 12:29.607
I'm on my way now.

12:29.658 --> 12:32.410
We're coming
around the south side.

12:34.530 --> 12:37.665
What is this?

12:37.750 --> 12:39.083
Tell me what's going on.

12:39.151 --> 12:40.585
Is someone coming?

12:40.652 --> 12:42.120
Honestly, sir,
I have no idea.

12:42.171 --> 12:43.651
Someone is looking into it,
all right?

12:43.655 --> 12:45.957
In the meantime, just stay back
and away from that door.

12:53.849 --> 12:57.936
Don't make a move.

12:58.003 --> 12:59.854
Please don't shoot.
It's not my fault.

12:59.939 --> 13:00.855
They made me do it!

13:00.940 --> 13:03.391
Made you do what?

13:03.475 --> 13:05.894
Made you do what?
I can't say.

13:05.978 --> 13:07.312
I can't!

13:07.363 --> 13:09.447
Get down!

13:23.746 --> 13:27.031
He's dead.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.503
What's the matter?

13:32.555 --> 13:35.223
I don't--I don't--
I can't breathe.

13:35.307 --> 13:36.874
What?

13:36.926 --> 13:39.710
You're burning up.
Mike, we got a problem.

13:39.762 --> 13:42.564
Our guy is not good.
He's having problems breathing.

13:42.648 --> 13:45.049
- Problems breathing how?
- I don't know.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.186
He's running a fever,
and his pulse is weak.

13:50.189 --> 13:53.575
Sam, did Hamed eat anything?

13:53.659 --> 13:56.611
Well, food, yeah.
He had a little plate of--

13:56.695 --> 13:59.197
oh, Mike, you're not saying--
not the crab cakes.

13:59.248 --> 14:02.733
Our guy
didn't call in a hit.

14:02.785 --> 14:05.236
He was confirming it.

14:05.287 --> 14:06.921
Hamed was poisoned.

14:07.006 --> 14:08.206
Son of a bitch.

14:13.073 --> 14:15.023
Combat support hospitals

14:15.075 --> 14:17.243
are portable operating rooms

14:17.327 --> 14:19.027
that can be set up anywhere
in an hour.

14:19.079 --> 14:20.463
If you don't have time

14:20.530 --> 14:21.914
to get your wounded
to a doctor,

14:21.998 --> 14:25.551
hospitals like these can bring
the doctor to you.

14:25.635 --> 14:27.086
But there are still
some injuries

14:27.170 --> 14:30.005
that even immediate
medical attention can't fix.

14:30.056 --> 14:31.891
His liver's failing.

14:31.975 --> 14:33.542
I gave him beta-blockers
to slow the poison,

14:33.593 --> 14:34.760
but his systems
are shutting down.

14:34.845 --> 14:35.928
Okay,
maybe it's time to get

14:36.012 --> 14:37.480
this guy
to a real hospital.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.231
No, he'll be too exposed
at a hospital.

14:39.316 --> 14:40.566
Wouldn't matter anyway.

14:40.650 --> 14:42.401
He was poisoned
with a custom-made toxin

14:42.486 --> 14:43.686
we can't reverse-engineer.

14:43.737 --> 14:45.865
You want to save him,
find the antidote.

14:45.866 --> 14:47.667
Without it,
I give him 24 hours tops.

14:48.527 --> 14:49.661
Oh, that's great.

14:49.712 --> 14:51.663
We have a day
to find the antidote,

14:51.714 --> 14:53.865
and our only lead is
the dead guy who poisoned him.

14:53.916 --> 14:55.300
It's better than nothing.

14:55.367 --> 14:56.217
If we start with what we know
about the assassin--

14:56.302 --> 14:57.535
Assassin?

14:57.586 --> 14:59.337
Snyder, you saw the guy.
He was terrified.

14:59.388 --> 15:00.538
He didn't even recognize
the Libyans

15:00.589 --> 15:01.840
when they drove up
in their car.

15:01.891 --> 15:03.174
He was a cut-out.

15:03.225 --> 15:04.059
I say we grill
whatever friends and family

15:04.143 --> 15:05.343
he has here in Miami

15:05.394 --> 15:06.678
and get his connection
to the Libyans.

15:06.729 --> 15:07.879
Okay, hang on,
now you're gonna drag

15:07.930 --> 15:10.098
the poor bastard's family
into this?

15:10.182 --> 15:11.483
Hamed is dying.
You got a better idea?

15:11.550 --> 15:13.051
A better idea
than interrogating

15:13.102 --> 15:14.185
a caterer's grandma?

15:14.236 --> 15:15.516
Yeah, give me, like,
two seconds.

15:15.554 --> 15:16.771
I'll give you
a better idea.

15:16.856 --> 15:17.739
This is not
your call to make.

15:17.823 --> 15:18.990
- Maybe it is.
- Hold on.

15:19.058 --> 15:20.492
Look, Fi and Jesse
are working on this.

15:20.559 --> 15:23.695
Let's see what they're doing
before we kill each other.

15:23.746 --> 15:24.562
All right.
Let's do it.

15:24.613 --> 15:27.916
Sam.

15:32.621 --> 15:34.255
Hey.

15:34.340 --> 15:36.007
I was just about to come get
you guys. Look at this.

15:36.075 --> 15:37.575
We checked the dead guy's
phone records.

15:37.626 --> 15:39.794
Last calls before we spotted him
were to a strip club

15:39.879 --> 15:41.262
down by the Miami River.
So the guy's into strippers.

15:41.347 --> 15:42.547
What does that have to do
with anything?

15:42.598 --> 15:43.598
Hang on, hang on.

15:43.683 --> 15:45.266
Place was investigated
six times

15:45.351 --> 15:46.351
for distributing
synthetic drugs

15:46.418 --> 15:47.469
to clubs in Miami.

15:47.553 --> 15:48.470
The owner's name

15:48.554 --> 15:50.088
is Dr. Khalid Maziq.

15:50.139 --> 15:52.691
Immigration papers list him
as a chemical engineer

15:52.758 --> 15:54.559
from Libya.

15:54.610 --> 15:56.427
I'd say we found the maker
of our poison.

15:56.479 --> 15:58.029
We make the right approach,

15:58.097 --> 15:59.764
we might be able to get
the antidote.

15:59.815 --> 16:01.483
The right approach?
How about a gun to his head?

16:01.567 --> 16:04.202
Snyder, he's a drug dealer.
He'll be very well-armed.

16:04.269 --> 16:05.469
If this turns
into a gun fight,

16:05.488 --> 16:07.455
you can forget
about saving Hamed.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.260
Your guys need to stay away
from that place.

16:09.291 --> 16:12.276
Fi, Jesse, the Libyans didn't
see you back at the hotel.

16:12.328 --> 16:13.495
If you could get in,

16:13.579 --> 16:16.331
get some alone time
with Maziq,

16:16.415 --> 16:17.582
we might be able
to do this.

16:17.633 --> 16:19.551
Right now?
He's gonna be spooked.

16:19.618 --> 16:22.787
We're gonna need an awful good
reason to talk to him.

16:22.838 --> 16:25.123
Tell me what you need.

16:32.314 --> 16:34.349
For someone who's not used
to being under surveillance,

16:34.433 --> 16:36.601
knowing someone's watching
can be a lot worse

16:36.652 --> 16:38.653
than being oblivious.

16:40.773 --> 16:42.934
The problem is that, when anyone
could be watching you,

16:42.942 --> 16:47.245
it often feels like
everyone is watching you.

16:47.312 --> 16:49.197
Afternoon, Mrs. Westen.

16:49.281 --> 16:51.750
Hello.

16:51.817 --> 16:52.700
Say hi, Charlie.
Hi.

16:52.785 --> 16:54.669
Hi, Charlie.

16:54.754 --> 16:56.838
Hey, Charlie, I want
to show you a cool bug I found.

16:56.922 --> 16:59.207
Go ahead.
See the bug, honey.

16:59.291 --> 17:02.010
Bye, Charlie.

17:03.846 --> 17:06.931
Let's see here.

17:06.999 --> 17:10.167
Mrs. Westen,
are you all right?

17:10.219 --> 17:11.051
Uh, could I ask you
a question?

17:11.137 --> 17:12.670
Yeah.

17:12.721 --> 17:15.839
Has the delivery truck
over my shoulder

17:15.891 --> 17:18.309
been there awhile?

17:18.359 --> 17:19.861
Delivery truck?

17:19.944 --> 17:22.180
Um, which one?

17:22.231 --> 17:24.449
The...

17:28.520 --> 17:29.737
I'm sorry.

17:29.822 --> 17:32.540
I must be having
a senior moment.

17:32.625 --> 17:35.126
Um, keep an eye
on Charlie.

17:35.194 --> 17:36.744
Of course.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.504
Whether you're
a professional

17:46.555 --> 17:48.539
or a civilian,
there's ultimately

17:48.591 --> 17:50.592
only one real way
to figure out for sure

17:50.676 --> 17:52.594
if someone's watching you.

17:52.678 --> 17:54.429
You have to go
somewhere concealed

17:54.513 --> 17:57.381
and see if they follow.

18:10.779 --> 18:13.665
Hold it.

18:13.732 --> 18:15.750
Why are you following me?

18:15.835 --> 18:19.454
Following you?
Ma'am, I'm just taking a walk.

18:19.538 --> 18:21.539
A walk?
Around here?

18:21.590 --> 18:23.591
In an alley
behind some dumpsters?

18:23.676 --> 18:25.126
Looks like
you had the same idea.

18:25.211 --> 18:27.178
I want answers.

18:27.246 --> 18:30.048
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

18:32.184 --> 18:34.552
Talk!
'Cause I will shoot you.

18:34.603 --> 18:38.640
Then I guess you'll just have
to shoot me.

18:50.769 --> 18:53.454
There are a lot of reasons
strip clubs

18:53.539 --> 18:54.989
have become
a common meeting spot

18:55.074 --> 18:57.575
for a wide range
of criminal activities.

18:57.626 --> 18:59.627
For one thing,
they're open in the day,

18:59.712 --> 19:01.663
windowless,
and too loud

19:01.747 --> 19:03.781
for good audio surveillance.

19:03.832 --> 19:05.783
They also provide privacy.

19:05.834 --> 19:08.786
Dark corners designed
for flirting with dancers

19:08.837 --> 19:10.288
work just as well
for a covert meeting.

19:10.339 --> 19:13.925
And of course, if you're doing
or saying anything illegal,

19:13.976 --> 19:17.679
chances are, everyone else will
be too distracted to notice.

19:22.234 --> 19:24.302
This is a tough gig.

19:24.353 --> 19:26.688
You get any suspicious looks
on your way in?

19:26.772 --> 19:29.657
Actually, I slipped in
without so much as a glance.

19:29.742 --> 19:32.076
That's
'cause you're not naked.

19:32.144 --> 19:34.779
Please tell me we have news
on our poisoner.

19:34.830 --> 19:37.081
Maziq's been having meetings
in his office all afternoon.

19:37.149 --> 19:39.167
See the pep squad over there
in the corner?

19:39.251 --> 19:40.702
They've been going up
one by one talking to him,

19:40.786 --> 19:42.003
probably planning

19:42.087 --> 19:44.322
some post-assassination
political activities.

19:44.373 --> 19:46.090
Been watching 'em since
I got here a few hours ago.

19:46.158 --> 19:47.175
Armed?

19:47.259 --> 19:48.459
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

19:48.510 --> 19:50.545
Seen a couple Glocks,
a few machine pistols.

19:50.629 --> 19:51.846
You sure this is the right
place to try to grab him?

19:51.931 --> 19:53.264
Well, he's only bringing
one bodyguard

19:53.332 --> 19:54.682
with him to the office.

19:54.767 --> 19:55.883
If we can get a meeting,
we can jump him in there.

19:55.968 --> 19:57.635
But with everything
that's going on,

19:57.686 --> 19:58.853
I don't know
how excited he's gonna be

19:58.938 --> 20:00.355
to make a drug deal
with us.

20:00.439 --> 20:02.273
Well, Snyder and I put
a little something together

20:02.341 --> 20:04.609
that might help with that.

20:07.780 --> 20:09.030
Wow.

20:09.114 --> 20:10.898
I thought we were gonna get,
like, a dime bag

20:10.983 --> 20:12.183
and some petty cash.
That is--

20:12.234 --> 20:14.986
That is a thousand tabs
of pure Ecstasy

20:15.037 --> 20:16.354
and $100,000 cash.

20:16.405 --> 20:18.990
And Snyder just has that
laying around?

20:19.041 --> 20:20.825
They have
a storage warehouse

20:20.876 --> 20:22.410
that is
like a terrorist swap meet.

20:22.494 --> 20:23.628
I didn't see all of it,
but there were some crates

20:23.695 --> 20:24.996
the Chinese army
probably wants back,

20:25.047 --> 20:27.465
not to mention
some serious biohazard symbols.

20:27.532 --> 20:28.750
Sounds like James could do

20:28.834 --> 20:30.218
some real damage
if he wanted to.

20:30.302 --> 20:32.337
Well, as much as I would like

20:32.388 --> 20:33.537
to dwell
on that delightful thought,

20:33.589 --> 20:34.973
this could be our chance.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.059
Maziq's finally popped
his head out.

20:38.143 --> 20:39.210
Let's do it.

20:39.261 --> 20:40.345
When you have to make
a cold approach

20:40.396 --> 20:41.646
and you have
to make it fast,

20:41.713 --> 20:45.316
you don't get any points
for being polite.

20:45.384 --> 20:46.601
The most important thing

20:46.685 --> 20:48.152
is to get
your target's attention.

20:48.220 --> 20:49.771
Dr. Mahzik.

20:49.855 --> 20:51.155
Because it doesn't matter
if they like you...

20:51.223 --> 20:53.324
It's Maziq.
Who are you?

20:53.392 --> 20:55.559
As long as they like
what you have to say.

20:55.611 --> 20:58.396
I'm Demetrius.
This is Janie.

20:58.447 --> 20:59.747
Listen.

20:59.832 --> 21:01.032
We need somebody
to help us out

21:01.033 --> 21:02.394
with a little
business arrangement.

21:02.401 --> 21:03.584
Word in the clubs
is that you are the man

21:03.669 --> 21:04.952
that we're looking for.

21:05.037 --> 21:06.454
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm too busy today.

21:06.538 --> 21:07.922
Oh, I'm sure you are.

21:08.007 --> 21:09.173
You're busy, I'm busy,
everybody's busy.

21:09.241 --> 21:10.291
It's a busy business.

21:10.376 --> 21:11.959
Maybe you didn't hear
what I said.

21:12.044 --> 21:14.379
I don't have time today.
I disagree.

21:14.430 --> 21:17.748
I think you do have time
for this.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.101
Oh, what the hell
are you doing?

21:20.185 --> 21:21.936
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

21:23.772 --> 21:25.106
It's time for them
to leave.

21:25.190 --> 21:26.757
And miss out on the biggest
deal of your life?

21:26.809 --> 21:28.559
What are you talking about?

21:28.610 --> 21:32.230
That is the purest "X"
in Miami. My product.

21:32.281 --> 21:34.365
And what does that
have to do with me?

21:34.433 --> 21:36.434
Man who used to make it for me
went and blew himself up.

21:36.485 --> 21:39.937
We have 50 gallons
of industrial-grade borohydride

21:39.988 --> 21:42.040
sitting in a truck
with nowhere to process it.

21:42.107 --> 21:43.624
We are offering you

21:43.709 --> 21:46.444
50% after expenses.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.164
All right.
I'll think about it.

21:50.249 --> 21:51.949
You know, I understand
that your time is valuable.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.302
Would 100,000

21:54.386 --> 21:57.138
be agreeable
for a ten-minute chat...

21:57.222 --> 21:59.674
Now?

22:01.810 --> 22:03.761
Come on.

22:03.812 --> 22:05.146
Follow me.

22:05.230 --> 22:07.165
Once you've sold
your cover I.D. to your target,

22:07.232 --> 22:08.933
it's important
to know your limits.

22:09.001 --> 22:12.186
The more complex and technical
your cover is,

22:12.271 --> 22:13.804
the greater the danger
you'll be discovered.

22:13.856 --> 22:16.190
If you're pretending
to be an expert

22:16.275 --> 22:17.859
in organic chemistry,
it's a good idea

22:17.943 --> 22:19.977
to make your move
as quickly as possible.

22:20.028 --> 22:23.781
So tell me, the borohydride--

22:23.832 --> 22:24.916
It's on its way here now.

22:24.983 --> 22:26.751
Hey, buddy.

22:26.818 --> 22:28.703
You want to give us
a second here?

22:28.787 --> 22:30.154
It's okay.
Go.

22:32.091 --> 22:37.128
Show him the money, baby.

22:37.179 --> 22:39.163
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

22:39.214 --> 22:40.664
We're gonna ask you
some questions,

22:40.716 --> 22:42.800
and you're gonna answer them.

22:42.851 --> 22:44.268
Who are you?

22:44.336 --> 22:46.387
We're friends of Omar Hamed.
You remember him.

22:46.472 --> 22:49.173
About yay high, gray hair,
you poisoned him.

22:49.224 --> 22:50.808
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:50.859 --> 22:51.859
Oh, try again, Maziq.

22:51.944 --> 22:53.528
The man who poisoned Hamed

22:53.612 --> 22:55.113
called here
right after he did it.

22:55.180 --> 22:57.681
You made the poison.
We want the antidote now.

23:01.653 --> 23:03.955
Oh, yeah.

23:04.022 --> 23:06.908
You need the antidote.

23:06.992 --> 23:09.160
You shoot me now,
then what?

23:09.211 --> 23:12.696
Hmm? How would I tell you
where it is?

23:21.373 --> 23:22.640
That was a bad move.

23:22.707 --> 23:23.975
I don't think so.

23:24.042 --> 23:25.760
Omar Hamed

23:25.844 --> 23:27.428
is going to die
like the dog that he is,

23:27.513 --> 23:28.879
and now so are you two.

23:28.931 --> 23:31.732
It's not gonna hold
very long, Fi.

23:31.817 --> 23:33.651
It's over.

23:33.718 --> 23:35.403
There's ten men
in the hall.

23:35.487 --> 23:37.488
No other way out of here.
Not so sure about that.

23:37.556 --> 23:39.890
Jesse, grab a chair.

23:39.942 --> 23:41.492
That window's
not gonna break itself.

23:41.560 --> 23:43.194
Oh, crap.

23:44.613 --> 23:45.580
Move.

23:45.664 --> 23:48.533
Excuse me.

23:54.089 --> 23:56.541
Come on.
No, wait, I can't swim!

23:56.592 --> 23:59.010
Then I suggest you hold
your breath.

24:13.048 --> 24:14.852
My people will find me,

24:14.853 --> 24:16.520
and they will kill you.

24:16.572 --> 24:17.906
Okay, we're clear
of Maziq's men,

24:17.990 --> 24:18.890
but we don't have long.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.226
Well, unfortunately,
he's not being very cooperative.

24:21.395 --> 24:22.779
Well, he better start
getting cooperative.

24:22.864 --> 24:24.831
Hamed is dying
because of this son of a bitch.

24:24.899 --> 24:26.566
Where the hell
is the antidote?

24:26.617 --> 24:29.068
There's your antidote.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.237
No, no, no,
Snyder, cool off, man.

24:31.289 --> 24:32.873
I'll cool off
when he starts talking.

24:32.924 --> 24:34.791
We don't get to fail,
do you understand?

24:34.876 --> 24:36.209
I understand that.

24:36.260 --> 24:37.627
Smacking him around
is not gonna help anything.

24:37.712 --> 24:39.352
Once he figures out
help's not on the way,

24:39.380 --> 24:41.515
he's gonna crack.
Trust me.

24:41.582 --> 24:42.516
And what if he doesn't?

24:42.583 --> 24:44.968
Hmm?

24:45.052 --> 24:47.220
Time for a more direct approach.

24:47.271 --> 24:49.606
What are you doing?

24:49.690 --> 24:51.558
Injecting him
with his own poison.

24:51.609 --> 24:53.610
I shot that straight
into your bloodstream, Maziq,

24:53.694 --> 24:54.861
so it's gonna hit you

24:54.929 --> 24:56.569
a lot harder and faster
than it did Hamed.

24:56.614 --> 24:58.365
If you want to live,

24:58.432 --> 25:00.867
you better take us
to that antidote right now.

25:09.944 --> 25:11.265
I don't like that look.
What's up?

25:11.278 --> 25:12.629
It's his electrolytes.
They're too high.

25:12.713 --> 25:15.081
He's gonna crash soon
unless we counteract the poison.

25:18.252 --> 25:21.287
Yeah, Jesse, we're running out
of time here.

25:21.339 --> 25:22.672
Please tell me
you've got the antidote.

25:22.757 --> 25:24.290
No, not yet, but it looks
like we're about to.

25:24.342 --> 25:26.259
Maziq's got a drug lab
out in Hialeah.

25:26.310 --> 25:29.429
It's 405 East 87th Street.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.481
Yeah, okay, look, Mike's
getting the car right now.

25:31.566 --> 25:33.183
We should just meet you there
with Hamed.

25:33.267 --> 25:35.819
You're bringing him.
Are you sure?

25:35.903 --> 25:38.021
Believe me, he may not even
last that long.

25:38.105 --> 25:40.991
The sooner he gets the antidote,
the better.

25:46.164 --> 25:47.647
Being under surveillance
is more stressful

25:47.698 --> 25:49.983
than most people realize.

25:50.034 --> 25:53.003
Even when you have no contact
with the people watching you,

25:53.087 --> 25:56.089
just knowing that they're there
can take a lot out of you.

25:56.156 --> 25:57.424
The problem is

25:57.491 --> 26:00.260
you begin to feel
eyes on you all the time.

26:00.327 --> 26:01.428
Often it's just

26:01.495 --> 26:04.214
your imagination
playing tricks on you,

26:04.298 --> 26:08.602
but sometimes those eyes
are all too real.

26:08.669 --> 26:12.355
Mrs. Westen, you don't really
want that cigarette, do you?

26:12.440 --> 26:15.308
You've been doing so well.

26:15.359 --> 26:18.011
Who the hell are you?

26:19.864 --> 26:21.898
I hear you've been looking
for answers.

26:21.983 --> 26:23.984
I am the man
who has them.

26:24.035 --> 26:26.486
What do you want?
Why are you in my house?

26:28.522 --> 26:30.523
Just want to have
a conversation.

26:30.575 --> 26:33.293
That's all.
Have a seat.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.879
Please.

26:35.963 --> 26:38.364
Now you feel free,
keep that gun pointed at me

26:38.416 --> 26:39.916
if it makes you feel
more comfortable.

26:40.001 --> 26:42.335
Yeah, I think I will.

26:42.386 --> 26:43.920
Good.

26:56.651 --> 26:59.236
Do you know who I am?

27:02.740 --> 27:04.357
You're the man
Michael's working with.

27:04.408 --> 27:06.109
Yes.

27:06.193 --> 27:09.613
The man who keeps
sending people to watch me.

27:09.697 --> 27:12.582
You care about your family
very much.

27:12.667 --> 27:15.285
What you have to understand is,
so do I.

27:15.369 --> 27:17.704
I made a commitment
to your son

27:17.755 --> 27:18.922
to protect you,

27:19.006 --> 27:21.458
all the people
he cares about.

27:21.542 --> 27:24.594
That includes you...
And Charlie.

27:24.679 --> 27:27.764
- You want to protect us?
- Yes.

27:27.848 --> 27:30.009
Then why do you have people
follow us everywhere we go?

27:30.017 --> 27:31.751
I know.

27:31.802 --> 27:34.020
It seems extreme.

27:34.088 --> 27:35.772
I'm a man who's willing
to go to extremes

27:35.856 --> 27:40.610
to do what I feel is right,
and...

27:40.695 --> 27:43.596
I make no apology for that.

27:46.651 --> 27:50.570
You're doing this because now
Michael works for you?

27:51.989 --> 27:53.823
Works for me.

27:53.908 --> 27:55.208
Uh, no.

27:55.275 --> 27:57.294
Michael is much more
than an employee,

27:57.378 --> 27:58.795
a great deal more than that,

27:58.879 --> 28:01.748
but I'm not here
to talk about Michael.

28:01.799 --> 28:05.752
Here to talk about you.

28:05.803 --> 28:09.306
You've already lost
so much--

28:09.390 --> 28:11.308
your husband

28:11.392 --> 28:15.261
and your son.

28:15.313 --> 28:17.964
I don't want you to lose
anyone else, Madeline.

28:19.633 --> 28:22.769
Please...

28:22.820 --> 28:24.988
Let me protect you.

28:32.246 --> 28:33.279
Fine.

28:33.331 --> 28:35.081
Thank you.

28:35.149 --> 28:37.167
The next time
you show up like this,

28:37.251 --> 28:40.954
I will shoot you on sight.

29:23.831 --> 29:25.031
This is it?

29:25.082 --> 29:26.549
That place is too big
to just be a drug lab.

29:26.634 --> 29:27.634
It's storage.

29:27.701 --> 29:30.387
Also distribution.

29:30.471 --> 29:33.223
There are training areas,
places for the men to stay.

29:33.307 --> 29:35.541
You said two guards, Maziq.
I count ten, easy.

29:35.593 --> 29:38.377
Probably increased security
after what happened at the club.

29:38.429 --> 29:40.713
That's a problem for us
and for you.

29:40.765 --> 29:42.215
How do we get in
without being seen?

29:42.266 --> 29:44.383
I don't know.
I'm not sure that you can.

29:44.435 --> 29:45.602
Well, you better
figure something out.

29:45.686 --> 29:47.487
Please, please,
I don't want to die.

29:47.554 --> 29:48.571
Well, then you better come up

29:48.656 --> 29:51.991
with a way
to get in there quick.

29:52.059 --> 29:53.943
Okay,
I might have something.

29:54.028 --> 29:55.745
In the back,
there's a break in the fence.

29:55.830 --> 29:58.064
It was supposed to be
our way out if police come.

29:58.115 --> 30:00.500
- Is it guarded?
- Maybe. I don't know.

30:00.567 --> 30:02.568
Well, it can't be
any worse than the front.

30:02.620 --> 30:04.954
Might be worth a shot.

30:10.077 --> 30:11.711
There are many techniques
for dealing with guards

30:11.762 --> 30:14.047
without raising alarm.

30:14.098 --> 30:15.932
Thanks.
I'm gonna go take a leak.

30:16.016 --> 30:18.384
They all boil down
to two basic steps--

30:18.436 --> 30:22.305
a stunning move to stop
your target from crying out

30:22.389 --> 30:25.108
and a subduing move
to keep him quiet.

30:25.192 --> 30:27.927
Okay, guys,
we're clear.

30:40.624 --> 30:43.243
You're up, Maziq.

30:56.257 --> 30:58.892
Here.

30:58.959 --> 31:01.394
Use the key.

31:09.520 --> 31:10.937
The antidote is
in the refrigerator.

31:10.988 --> 31:13.806
Well, go get it.

31:18.612 --> 31:21.531
Let's go, Maziq.

31:26.003 --> 31:29.172
Grab me a syringe
from there.

31:41.886 --> 31:43.770
What are you doing?
You said--

31:43.837 --> 31:45.171
- I know what I said.
Sit down.

31:45.222 --> 31:46.505
Snyder, what the hell's
going on?

31:46.557 --> 31:47.974
We only needed him to show us
the proper dose.

31:48.025 --> 31:50.186
We don't need him alive.
You're just gonna let him die?

31:50.227 --> 31:51.394
You're gonna let him go back
in business,

31:51.478 --> 31:52.845
so he can take another shot
at Hamed?

31:52.897 --> 31:54.480
Or maybe you want
to turn him over to the FBI,

31:54.532 --> 31:56.515
so he can tell them
all about us?

31:56.567 --> 31:57.650
No.
This ends here.

31:57.701 --> 32:00.036
Either the poison's
gonna kill him,

32:00.120 --> 32:01.404
or his pals are gonna
execute him for helping us.

32:01.488 --> 32:02.539
I'm good either way.

32:02.623 --> 32:04.874
Okay, just hold on.

32:09.079 --> 32:11.548
Snyder!

32:17.137 --> 32:18.871
So much for getting
out of here quietly.

32:18.923 --> 32:20.506
It came from over here!

32:20.558 --> 32:21.558
Hey, there they are!

32:21.642 --> 32:23.560
Move.
Move!

32:29.400 --> 32:31.717
We got them cornered.

32:31.769 --> 32:32.718
You all right?

32:32.770 --> 32:35.238
Yeah, but Hamed won't be

32:35.322 --> 32:37.073
if we don't get him
that damn antidote.

32:47.545 --> 32:49.106
They got us covered
from two directions.

32:49.586 --> 32:51.721
There's two in the upper hallway
and one by the exit.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.644
- Is there another way out?
- No, there's no luck.

32:58.712 --> 33:00.879
It's just some barred up windows
this way.

33:00.931 --> 33:02.648
Only way out's
the way we came in.

33:04.935 --> 33:09.438
Call Michael.
Tell him to hang back.

33:12.276 --> 33:13.442
How's he doing, Sam?

33:13.527 --> 33:15.111
Not good, Mike.

33:15.195 --> 33:18.864
His breathing is shallow,
and he's getting cold.

33:21.034 --> 33:22.752
- How's his heart rate?
- Even worse.

33:22.836 --> 33:24.420
Dropping about a quarter beat
every minute.

33:25.839 --> 33:27.173
Jesse, we're almost there.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.542
Okay, listen, we got
into a bit of a situation

33:29.593 --> 33:30.876
with Maziq's guards.

33:30.928 --> 33:32.244
We're gonna have to come out
to you guys.

33:32.296 --> 33:34.463
There's a clearing
about 100 yards behind the lab.

33:34.548 --> 33:36.248
Wait there.
Have Hamed ready.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.466
Believe me, he will be.

33:37.551 --> 33:39.218
Just get to us
as fast as you can.

33:39.269 --> 33:41.270
He doesn't have long.
Will do, brother.

33:41.355 --> 33:42.605
And keep your head down.

33:42.689 --> 33:46.142
We're gonna be coming out
extremely hot.

33:46.226 --> 33:47.276
Okay,
Mike should be here soon.

33:47.361 --> 33:49.928
Sounds like Hamed's fading fast,
though.

33:55.819 --> 33:56.935
We need to make a run for it,
now.

33:56.987 --> 33:58.454
If two of us lay down

33:58.538 --> 33:59.605
enough cover fire,
it should be enough

33:59.656 --> 34:00.873
for the other one to get out.

34:00.940 --> 34:02.107
Jesse, you ready to run?

34:02.159 --> 34:04.076
What about you two?

34:04.127 --> 34:06.445
Someone has to hold them off.
We'll be right behind you, okay?

34:06.496 --> 34:07.913
You better be.

34:07.965 --> 34:09.581
You take the two
in the upper hallway,

34:09.632 --> 34:10.616
and I'll take the exit.

34:10.667 --> 34:11.884
You ready?

34:11.951 --> 34:13.969
On three.
Three.

34:42.032 --> 34:44.699
- Where's Hamed?
- In the back with Sam.

34:44.784 --> 34:45.835
Where are Fi and Snyder?

34:45.918 --> 34:49.839
They should be
right behind me.

35:00.434 --> 35:03.001
The window!

35:04.054 --> 35:05.221
What are we gonna do?

35:05.305 --> 35:06.705
They got us surrounded
on all sides.

35:06.773 --> 35:11.009
I'll take care of this.
You just keep these guys busy.

35:18.485 --> 35:20.786
Oh, Jesus.

35:20.854 --> 35:23.522
Snyder, get back!
It's gonna blow.

35:41.391 --> 35:43.059
Snyder!

35:43.143 --> 35:47.813
I'm trapped.
The flames are too high!

35:47.881 --> 35:50.716
Find something to help me
get through this window.

35:52.853 --> 35:57.273
I can't find anything.
I'm sorry.

35:57.357 --> 36:00.076
- Snyder!
- I'm sorry.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.611
I can't!

36:02.696 --> 36:04.447
Snyder!

36:11.788 --> 36:13.956
Where's Fiona?

36:14.040 --> 36:15.574
Snyder, where is she?

36:15.625 --> 36:17.242
She didn't make it. Come on.
The whole place is on fire.

36:17.294 --> 36:18.677
We gotta get out of here.

36:18.745 --> 36:19.929
What do you mean,
she didn't make it?

36:20.013 --> 36:21.430
I mean she's gone.
There was an explosion.

36:21.515 --> 36:24.583
And there was--
did you see it happen?

36:24.634 --> 36:27.269
Did you see her die?

36:40.600 --> 36:42.818
Fi!

36:51.828 --> 36:53.963
Fi!

37:00.286 --> 37:02.120
Aah!

37:48.134 --> 37:50.102
Fi.

38:34.282 --> 38:35.886
Michael.

38:35.887 --> 38:39.506
Hey.
Hey, Fi.

38:39.957 --> 38:41.925
How long have I been here?

38:41.992 --> 38:43.844
Just a few hours.

38:47.332 --> 38:49.266
Hamed?
He's gonna be okay.

38:49.334 --> 38:51.886
We got him the antidote
in time.

38:56.892 --> 38:59.560
What is this?

39:01.229 --> 39:03.063
Nothing.

39:09.187 --> 39:11.288
You got me out of there.

39:11.356 --> 39:13.857
I didn't think
I was gonna get out.

39:13.909 --> 39:17.044
Thank you.

39:17.128 --> 39:19.496
You would have done
the same.

39:21.583 --> 39:23.968
Sir,
can you join us outside?

39:31.142 --> 39:34.011
Hey, Mike.
How's Fi doing?

39:34.062 --> 39:36.880
She's--she's stable,
and she'll be okay.

39:36.932 --> 39:40.434
Good. Can't keep her down
for long, huh?

39:42.553 --> 39:46.023
Looks like the hive
is buzzing.

39:48.559 --> 39:49.443
Heard about Fiona.

39:49.527 --> 39:52.079
If she needs anything,

39:52.163 --> 39:53.998
you don't hesitate to ask.
You understand?

39:54.065 --> 39:57.201
I'm sorry we couldn't take her
to a real hospital.

39:57.252 --> 39:58.619
They'd ask
too many questions.

39:58.703 --> 40:01.839
We owe her, you,
and your entire team

40:01.906 --> 40:03.240
a great debt of gratitude
for today.

40:03.291 --> 40:04.458
And Hamed?

40:04.542 --> 40:06.844
He's more than okay.

40:06.911 --> 40:08.512
He's on his way to Tripoli now
for the second round

40:08.579 --> 40:10.381
of peace talks.

40:10.432 --> 40:12.600
I know it wasn't easy,

40:12.684 --> 40:14.551
but it was
a successful mission.

40:14.603 --> 40:16.804
For the most part.

40:16.888 --> 40:19.089
- James, I--
- Ben, don't.

40:19.140 --> 40:21.775
Just don't make excuses.

40:23.561 --> 40:25.762
Do you remember
when I first invited you

40:25.814 --> 40:27.865
to join me, to join us?

40:27.932 --> 40:30.434
Of course.
I'll never forget it.

40:30.485 --> 40:32.152
And do you remember

40:32.237 --> 40:36.573
the promises that we made
to each other that day?

40:36.625 --> 40:39.776
That we would always
stand together.

40:39.828 --> 40:42.997
Stand together.
Yes.

40:43.081 --> 40:44.298
What else?

40:44.382 --> 40:46.166
What did I tell you
when you asked

40:46.251 --> 40:49.553
to run a team
in a field?

40:49.620 --> 40:51.505
We'd never leave anyone
behind.

40:51.589 --> 40:52.506
That's right.

40:52.590 --> 40:54.341
Never.

40:54.426 --> 40:55.509
James, please,

40:55.593 --> 40:56.793
you have to understand,
I didn't think

40:56.845 --> 40:58.128
that there was anything
I could do to save her.

40:58.179 --> 40:59.596
I understand that.

40:59.648 --> 41:02.650
I understand it.

41:05.487 --> 41:07.404
I can't forgive it.

41:07.472 --> 41:08.405
James...

41:08.473 --> 41:09.773
That's enough.

41:09.824 --> 41:10.941
James, what the hell
are you doing?

41:10.992 --> 41:12.743
What needs to be done,
Michael.

41:12.810 --> 41:14.745
He made a mistake.

41:14.812 --> 41:17.448
A mistake?

41:17.499 --> 41:19.249
A member of your team
almost died today

41:19.317 --> 41:22.953
because of this man's
lack of action.

41:23.004 --> 41:26.507
I don't call that a mistake.

41:26.591 --> 41:28.676
I call it cowardice.

41:28.760 --> 41:29.843
I call it betrayal.

41:29.928 --> 41:32.379
James...

41:32.464 --> 41:34.715
He made a promise,
Michael.

41:36.601 --> 41:39.002
And promises must be kept.

41:44.359 --> 41:46.343
Tell me I'm wrong.

41:46.394 --> 41:47.978
James...

41:48.029 --> 41:50.680
Tell me I'm wrong.

41:56.187 --> 41:58.288
Good-bye, Ben.
