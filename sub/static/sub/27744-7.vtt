02:32.277 --> 02:33.153
[chuckles]

02:33.236 --> 02:35.488
Just kidding. I did do my hair, though.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.074
I thought I smelled my hair spray.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.117
It's incredible.

It's got hold, but not too aggressive.

-Almost never.

Well, I'm making you breakfast anyway.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.530
Did you get up early to let them in?

03:17.614 --> 03:21.201
-No, they all have keys.
-Uh...

03:21.284 --> 03:22.327
Oh, thank you.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.592
[chuckles] You always say that.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.510
Name one other time I've said that.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.762
At Disneyland,

03:40.845 --> 03:43.806
when you hopped off
Pirates of the Caribbean mid-ride

03:43.890 --> 03:45.767
to chill with "that dog."

03:45.850 --> 03:47.644
I drank bong water that day.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.021
Where you been, Kooky?
We haven't seen you in days.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.607
I have been painting non-stop.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.942
I've barely slept.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.818
Jeez, what got into you at that ashram?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.321
The only thing I got
was a lecture from my hematologist

03:58.404 --> 04:00.490
about "making better choices."

04:01.407 --> 04:02.951
[laughs]

04:04.244 --> 04:06.037
Nothing got into me, Grace.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.373
I mean, my blood's weird now, too.

04:08.456 --> 04:13.795
But opening myself up to that place
sparked an artistic renaissance.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.213
Even Da Vinci took a break.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.966
Now, would madame like her Cheerios
folded in the omelet

04:18.049 --> 04:19.092
or sprinkled on top?

04:19.175 --> 04:21.594
Wish that I could, pal,
but I need to get back.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.929
I'm crushing it up there.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.265
Just here for the coffee.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.517
Aha! There you go.

How do they know I take it
with Mountain Dew?

-What was that?
-What was what?

04:38.486 --> 04:40.321
Your tambourine hand.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.948
That was nothing.

04:42.031 --> 04:46.160
I've just been putting a lot of stress
on my wrists with all the creating.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.371
Caffeine in your caffeine
probably doesn't help.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.748
-Oh.
-Frankie, you've had TIAs.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.251
You should go to a doctor
and get that checked out.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.962
I don't need to. It's nothing.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.255
I know my body.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.256
Do you?

04:58.339 --> 05:00.842
How about when you were with Jacob
and thought you were pregnant?

05:01.384 --> 05:02.593
[chuckles]

05:02.677 --> 05:04.721
I drank bong water that day, too.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.932
Well, I'm taking you to the doctor,
by force if necessary.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.435
Oh, I'm shaking. No, I'm not.

like their quiche?

-Why are you obsessing about brunch?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.745
I wanna make
a good impression on your father,

05:28.828 --> 05:30.246
unlike the first time I met your mom.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.539
My mom loves you.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.417
No, I think she felt she had
to say it 'cause I said it first.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.543
It'll be fine.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.795
My dad'll make fun of my job.
He'll eat the quiche,

05:37.879 --> 05:40.214
will like it more than he thought,
won't admit it, then he'll leave.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.467
Yeah. He'll leave
with a new best friend.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.969
He already has a best friend.
His name is Bruno, and he's dead.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.514
Okay, I can work with that. I know
a lot of dead guys through my mom.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.308
-Hmm.
-[knock on door]

05:50.391 --> 05:51.517
Be right there.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.605
Don't mention Evan's in jail 'cause my
dad knows nothing about the embezzling.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.066
What? How does he not know
your brother's in jail?

05:58.149 --> 06:00.026
It's just that Evan
is my dad's favorite,

06:00.109 --> 06:02.362
and he's got a weak heart
and strong yelling muscles.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.113
Well, how-- How is this even possible?

06:04.614 --> 06:06.491
We just say
he's traveling for work,

06:06.574 --> 06:08.951
and when he phones us from prison,
my mom always accepts the call.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.953
-Just don't say anything, okay?
-But I-- We--

-Hey!

-Hey, there she is. Oh.
-Hi, Mom. How are you?

-Hey. How you-- Okay, that's-- Yeah.
-Oh, how is this baby?

06:18.127 --> 06:19.587
-Good to see you.
-Hey there. Hi.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.889
Honestly, it's not that bad.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.102
You look like one of those elite athletes
in a Gatorade commercial.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.479
I look like I'm on life support.

[whirring stops]

06:51.702 --> 06:54.664
Robert, this is your health
we're talking about.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.917
Insufficient oxygen
can put a lot of stress on the heart,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.460
and you've already had one heart attack.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.671
Do you want me to start quoting WebMD?

07:01.754 --> 07:04.632
-Didn't you just quote WebMD?
-You want me to withhold sex?

07:04.715 --> 07:07.260
Sometimes. After you've eaten pastrami.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.178
-Where are you going?
-To the park.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.765
I'm late to help Oliver
not be horrible in<i> Man of La Mancha.</i>

07:12.849 --> 07:14.350
Fine. We'll talk about it later.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.103
Just let me find Carl.
We're coming with you.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.898
You don't feel weird about rehearsing
in the middle of a park?

07:20.982 --> 07:23.901
It's a gay park.
Everybody's rehearsing something.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.700
Hey, can I make breakfast or what?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.122
Sure, we can talk about Frankie.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.624

07:38.708 --> 07:40.126
I'm sorry.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.504
It's just, what if it's Parkinson's?

07:43.588 --> 07:47.133
Oh, hey, hey, don't go wide.
It's probably nothing, just like she said.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.343
But just in case,
why don't we get her to my doctor?

07:49.427 --> 07:52.763
He's very good and we'll get right in.
Because of the money.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.891
Is he a warlock who diagnoses people

07:54.974 --> 07:57.810
based on the behavior of the birds
outside his office?

07:57.894 --> 08:00.271
No? Frankie's not gonna see him.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.315
It's touching
how much you worry about her.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.566
[scoffs]

08:03.649 --> 08:04.775
You have no idea.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.195
It haunts me.
Do you remember my friend Babe?

08:07.278 --> 08:10.656
Yeah, she was in management
at Boeing or something.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.326
No. The gal Frankie killed.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.203
Oh, right. Yeah, sure. Babe.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.579
I saw her at the ashram.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.499
She, uh... She came to me in a vision.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.500
[sighs]

08:21.709 --> 08:22.710
Toilet gin.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.589
Made me realize
how much I'd worry about Frankie if...

08:26.672 --> 08:27.507
[sighs]

08:27.882 --> 08:31.260
you know, if we became
regulars at Chez Nick.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.971
There will always be
a table for you there...

08:34.055 --> 08:35.056
unless Clooney's in town.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.140

08:37.058 --> 08:39.727

she's going to be okay.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.946
That is not the end of the scene.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.740
-That's where our problems begin.
-[Oliver] I'm sorry.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.326
I got distracted by guys
over there rehearsing<i> West Side Story.</i>

08:56.327 --> 08:57.703
[fingers snapping]

08:59.580 --> 09:01.958
Look, this is the scene

09:02.041 --> 09:05.169
where Cervantes walks out
into the light to be judged.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.714
He's an old man taking stock
of all that has passed

09:08.798 --> 09:10.591
and will never be again.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.009
So, not what I just did?

09:12.093 --> 09:14.053
No. Let me show you.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.847
-It's OK. Just talk me through it.
-No, this is how we learn.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.517
-I don't want you to exert yourself.
-By getting up?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.562
Well, Sol told me that you've
been having some breathing issues.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.897
Oh, God, when did he tell you that?

09:24.981 --> 09:27.608
Just now, in a very long text.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.027
I'm sorry. Did I just ruin your marriage?

09:30.111 --> 09:33.906
No, Sol is doing
most of the heavy lifting on that front.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.659
I actually think it's sweet
that he's so worried about you.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.871
-Please don't get mad at him.
-Oh, I don't get mad, I get even.

09:41.414 --> 09:45.835
And revenge is a dish best served
when Sol is in the shower.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.629
[Oliver] Oh, God. What is he doing?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.256
Listen, I'll be right back.

Guys, you're in a street gang,
not a yogurt commercial.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.018
[Sol] It's okay. You're a good boy, Carl.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.813
-What is the matter with you?
-Sorry, are we bothering you?

10:05.896 --> 10:09.025
You tried to make him fetch
when he disobeyed, you gave him a treat.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.570
Well, he loves treats
and I love him, so...

10:12.653 --> 10:15.156
Stop. You're embarrassing yourself.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.199
This dog is man's greatest creation,

through years of painstaking husbandry.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.457
-Carl?
-Yes!

10:24.540 --> 10:26.000
You're letting him call the shots.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.127
He needs to know
you're in charge, not him.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.254
You have to be the alpha.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.589
So I'm the beta?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.966

How did you do that?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.990
It's the command my mother uses
for her German shepherds.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.284
I guess it translates
to Jack Russells, too.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.370
Well, it really does work.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.624

of German yelling.

-Hey, girl.
-Oh, good.

Could you hand me my painting clog?

Oh, sure, I was hoping
to come up here and touch your shoes.

11:20.888 --> 11:21.931
What're you working on?

11:22.014 --> 11:24.100
Oh, honestly, Grace? I don't know.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.727
The muse is just flowing through me.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.814
Feels like it's all a part
of something, but I have no idea what.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.400
Well, I've always been good at puzzles.

11:33.234 --> 11:36.570
But helpless to solve
the greatest puzzle of all, yourself.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.245
Side note:
you smudge one of those paintings

11:44.328 --> 11:46.414
and you owe me $20 billion.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.040
[chuckles] Oh, God.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.381
Oh, my God. Frankie, it's him.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.427
Oh, my God. It's him.

12:00.302 --> 12:03.681
Frankie, why would you paint
a man you hated from the ashram?

12:03.764 --> 12:06.350
Okay, so, cards on the table.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.602
I super-boned that dude.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.231
[chuckles]
What? But you said you loathed him!

12:12.314 --> 12:14.859
I thought I resolved those issues
by sleeping with him,

12:14.942 --> 12:16.736
but it'd appear he's still inside me.

12:16.819 --> 12:17.653
Ew.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.282
Quick, read me my last haiku
I wrote in my haiku journal.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.748
"Who is the you who

12:28.831 --> 12:32.376
The yurt's all sex and raisins

12:32.918 --> 12:34.962
You're inauthentic"

12:35.963 --> 12:37.548
Frankie, this is ridiculous.

12:37.631 --> 12:38.632
Is it?

12:38.716 --> 12:41.093
Or is everything Leo said about me right?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.595
I am inauthentic.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.014
I've got to get back to my roots.

12:45.097 --> 12:49.143
Where did I go so wrong to have
such a comfortable life with you?

12:49.226 --> 12:51.020
Oh, yeah, I'm-- I'm terrible.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.607
Introducing you
to the evils of socks, floss.

12:54.690 --> 12:59.111
I live... in... a... beach house.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.947
I mean, my God, I'm a businesswoman!

13:02.031 --> 13:03.783
Agh, it makes me gag.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.368
Maybe I should go to Leo now.
He could be my guru.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.789
Get me back to my roots.
Tell me who to give all of my stuff to.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.040
Probably gorillas.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.083
Okay, Frankie, just calm down.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.504
Okay, you haven't slept or eaten
in God knows how long.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.380
Let's make a deal. Get some rest.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.383
Take your medication
and then come and join me for dinner

13:21.467 --> 13:23.010
so we can get some food in you.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.221
Food? Sleep? What next?

13:25.304 --> 13:27.598
Hats made of gold? Gold made of toilets?

13:27.681 --> 13:30.476
-[Grace chuckles]
-I... Okay, I...

13:30.559 --> 13:33.312
I am a little tired.
-[chuckles]

13:33.395 --> 13:35.481
[baby babbling over radio]

13:36.440 --> 13:39.485
And I don't want
one of those new age weddings

13:39.568 --> 13:41.654
-where one of your friends has dreads...
-[Goldie laughs] No way!

13:41.737 --> 13:42.863
and a guitar marrying you.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.657
Rabbi Sun Bear doesn't have dreads.

13:44.740 --> 13:45.741
[sighs]
Oh, Jesus.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.368
We don't have to
talk about our wedding.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.495
We can talk about anything else.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.663
North Korea.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.456
Don't get him started on North Korea.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.584
Let's talk about your bachelor party. Huh?

13:55.668 --> 13:58.128
You know, you should get Evan to plan it.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.880
What are you thinking, Vegas?

13:59.964 --> 14:03.843
Actually, we're going to build houses
in El Centro with Habitat.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.845
-Oh.
-You're going to Vegas.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.264
Now Evan's firm,
they got a ton of connections there.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.683
He's friends with Criss Angel.
They vacation together.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.434
Dad, I think a little bit of charity

14:12.518 --> 14:14.603
mixed with a little bit of male bonding
could be a fun idea.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.604
Yes.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.023
Coming from the girl
who played Barbie Hospice.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.985
[chuckles] I was helping
those beautiful ladies die with dignity.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.612
-Hey, how about this brunch, huh?
-Oh.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.157
-Goldie, are you enjoying your quiche?
-Oh, it's a bit too hot.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.702
-Damn it.
-Well, okay, guys. Drive safe.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.705
[chuckles] What?

14:32.788 --> 14:33.831
Yeah.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.417
But we just got here.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.669
You don't have time for your old dad?

14:38.752 --> 14:41.463
You know, Evan has time for us.
Calls every week.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.050
Of course, the only time we hear from
Allison is when she's a new syndrome.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.721
Maybe we should ease up
on the Allison-Evan comparisons.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.139
I'm not making any comparisons.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.392
I'm just saying, I mean,
Evan's a strong, hearty boy,

14:53.475 --> 14:56.312
and Allison has something
called "wandering pancreas."

14:56.395 --> 14:59.064
At least Allison's pancreas
can wander wherever it wants.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.025
-Bud--
-[Goldie] Uh, sweetie?

15:01.108 --> 15:03.319
-Stop scratching. Stop it.
-Oh, I'm fine.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.614
-It's just itchy in here.
-You know who's never itchy?

15:06.697 --> 15:08.949
Is it Evan? Is Evan never itchy?

15:09.033 --> 15:12.620
Does Criss Angel zap his itches away
or whatever the fuck they do together?

15:13.162 --> 15:16.832
I don't know what happens on vacation.
Evan is famously discreet.

15:17.207 --> 15:21.003
I do know they don't pack
an entire suitcase of allergy cream.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.004
I need that.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.632
You know why you don't know
what happens on his vacations?

15:25.007 --> 15:30.429
Because he's been on a two-year vacation
in prison for embezzling!

15:33.015 --> 15:34.600
[chuckling]

15:36.852 --> 15:37.686
[whimpers]

15:39.563 --> 15:41.190
How about that North Korea, huh?

15:42.316 --> 15:44.818
Hmm? Kim Jong-un. Right?

15:45.986 --> 15:46.946
Okay?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.323
[door closes]

15:50.074 --> 15:52.868
Oh, you know they charge you
when you take those things.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.453
That's why I took yours.

15:55.204 --> 15:59.375
You're gonna be seeing a lot of burlap
from now on, sister.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.502
I'm getting back to what I used to be:

16:01.585 --> 16:04.755
raw, uncompromising, dangerous.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.006
Proto-Frankie.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.677
Also, I'm going to bathe less.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.429
-Less?
-Less.

16:13.180 --> 16:16.809
Okay, well... [clears throat]
I'm making one of your favorites:

16:16.892 --> 16:18.852
quesadillas stuffed with quesadillas.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.397
Oh, no can do,<i> hermana.</i>

16:21.480 --> 16:23.273
I'm off cheese. Cold turkey.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.109
Off turkey, too. Cold cheese.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.153
So, you'll throw out all the turkey
and cheese on your dashboard?

16:28.237 --> 16:31.573
Yes, because Proto-Frankie is,
above all else, authentic.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.828
I'm finally going to be the vegan
I've claimed to be for years.

16:35.911 --> 16:39.039
Okay, let's see. What day is it? The 18th.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.833
I give it... 30 minutes.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.876
Scoff all you want, but I'm serious.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.921
Argh. Okay. We'll order in.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.340
Do me a favor.
Put these on the table, will you?

16:48.424 --> 16:52.386
The least we can do is have a little
ambiance while we eat from Styrofoam.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.013
No problemo.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.851
What the hell are you doing?

16:58.934 --> 16:59.977
Vegan, Grace.

17:00.060 --> 17:04.523
Every time you burn a candle,
you are inconveniencing bees.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.109
-[knock on door]
-You are a lot today.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.074
What are you doing here?

17:14.158 --> 17:16.952
I was in the neighborhood
with my old business school buddy, Joe.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.788
-I'm his old business school buddy, Joe.
-Hi, Joe.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.584
And I wanted him to meet you, and I think
he'll get a real hoot out of Frankie.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.543
Yeah.

17:24.626 --> 17:29.339
But, you see, she's obsessed with this guy
who's made her go all Weather Underground.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.718
She is in no mood for two white men
who went to business school.

17:32.801 --> 17:36.388
I'm hearing you,
but I promise Frankie is gonna love Joe.

17:36.472 --> 17:40.517
He's handsome, annoyingly leftist,
and has done acid with Todd Rundgren.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.478
[Joe] It's true. We were on a plane.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.104
It was not a good time.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.564
Well, that is her type.
[chuckles]

17:45.647 --> 17:48.067
-So let's introduce these two.
-Why are you so eager?

17:48.150 --> 17:51.945
-Is this some kind of setup?
-She's hung up on this guy you hate.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.573
So maybe Joe can take her mind off him.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.991
[inhales]

17:56.742 --> 17:57.993
Maybe.
[sighs]

17:58.077 --> 17:59.369
<i>Anhalten?</i>

18:01.914 --> 18:02.873
<i>Anhalten.</i>

18:04.166 --> 18:06.251
Please<i> anhalten.</i>

18:08.170 --> 18:09.296
Carl...

18:10.005 --> 18:11.006
<i>Anhalten.</i>

18:12.800 --> 18:13.926
[sighs]

18:19.306 --> 18:20.516
[Oliver] No!

18:24.812 --> 18:25.687
[scoffs]

18:25.771 --> 18:27.106
[Sol] There you go.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.817
I am looking directly at you!

18:40.536 --> 18:42.412
[Frankie slurps]
Mmm.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.789
-[Joe] Mmm.
-[Frankie] Mmm.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.377
Don't you think you should
eat that gray stuff with a fork?

18:48.460 --> 18:49.503
[whispers]
We've got company.

18:49.586 --> 18:53.507
This is how you eat <i>mutabal</i>
in Afghanistan, Nancy Reagan.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.883
Very authentic.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.595
-Joe's been to Afghanistan.
-Mmm. Not by choice.

18:58.679 --> 19:02.683
I do like Afghan food though,
and, um, you really know your stuff.

19:02.766 --> 19:06.145
Don't try to butter me up, guy.
I'm on a totally different trip:

19:06.228 --> 19:09.398
ashram, Proto-Frankie, life changings.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.066
-You dig?
-I very dig.

19:11.608 --> 19:15.362
Back in '94, I lived with a Russian guru
in the Mongolian steppe

19:15.946 --> 19:19.825
exposing myself to bitter cold
for hours on end doing breath work.

19:19.908 --> 19:20.951
It changed my life.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.453
Are you talking about Gregor Greshnev,

19:24.163 --> 19:26.999
author of<i> Lungs of Ice, Heart Also of Ice?</i>

19:27.082 --> 19:28.667
Yes, I am, indeed.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.545
I can still hold my breath
under freezing cold water

19:31.628 --> 19:32.880
for seven and a half minutes.

19:32.963 --> 19:36.508
-I bet you can. I bet you can.
-[Joe chuckles]

19:36.592 --> 19:39.595
Could someone pass the pink thing
that looks like a wool sock?

19:39.678 --> 19:44.600
Frankie, Joe also once did acid
with Todd Rundgren.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.852
Oh, tell me everything.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.229
Only if you tell me

19:49.313 --> 19:52.941
about these beautiful hands of yours.
-[chuckles]

19:53.025 --> 19:55.110
Well, they're painter's hands.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.279
I bet they are.

19:57.779 --> 20:01.283
-I bet they are.
-[Frankie laughs]

20:01.408 --> 20:03.493
[Frankie and Joe laugh]

20:03.785 --> 20:06.872
-Cool if I go make myself a sandwich?
-Yeah, knock yourself out.

20:06.955 --> 20:07.831
[sighs]

20:08.916 --> 20:12.169
Your eyes are very clear. That's good.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.297
Thank you. I watch a lot of Showtime.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.465
[laughs]

20:16.548 --> 20:18.050
You're a riot! [chuckles]

20:18.133 --> 20:19.635
You are a riot.

20:19.718 --> 20:23.263
-[inhales] Now push against my hands.
-I thought you'd never ask.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.973
[both laugh]

20:25.057 --> 20:28.518
Oh, good. Strong wrists.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.770
[Frankie sighs]

20:32.022 --> 20:33.982
-[spoon clatters]
-I'll be right back.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.735
Don't eat all the barf without me.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.161
-Joe is your doctor, isn't he?
-Yep.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.580
God. And he's giving Frankie
a secret exam.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.581
Yep.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.875
So you lied to me.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.544
Yep. But it was a good kind of lie,

20:54.628 --> 20:57.047
like when you tell a kid
they can be anything.

20:57.130 --> 21:01.468
You were so upset about Frankie's tremor.
I was just trying to help.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.553
It's not helpful
to go behind my back.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.640
I had a whole marriage of that.
I don't want it with you.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.143
Of course, I'm sorry.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.813
For what it's worth... I'm still straight.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.608
Also, I would like you to check with me

21:16.692 --> 21:19.695
before you do something duplicitous
to manipulate Frankie,

21:19.778 --> 21:20.988
'cause that's my thing.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.032
God... we're perfect for each other.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.999
Could you hand me the rice?

21:32.749 --> 21:35.252
I like a woman with a strong appetite.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.046
Is that how you'd describe
your appetite, strong?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.841
My appetite is notoriously robust.

21:40.924 --> 21:41.800
[Joe] Oh.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.267
Come on, fella.
You gonna feed me or tease me?

21:50.350 --> 21:52.227
Anticipation is half the fun.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.104
I haven't found that to be true.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.984
Good grip. There you go.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.695
I have to remember
I'm in a relationship now.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.573
It's not just my schemes,
it's our schemes.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.450
You had me at "schemes."

22:07.576 --> 22:08.994
I know what's going on here.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.245
-What? No, we didn't.
-Just a sandwich.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.456
You're trying to set me up with Joe.

22:14.082 --> 22:14.958
Uh...

22:15.542 --> 22:18.211
Caught us. Or him, rather.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.296
Guilty as charged.

22:19.379 --> 22:24.176
Nick, I'm very flattered,
but I just had a guy rock my world.

22:24.259 --> 22:27.012
And I know I'm usually
into super handsy dudes,

22:27.095 --> 22:30.974
but Joe has got to work on his flirt game.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.269
I felt like I was getting an examination.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.146
-Well, that's weird.
-Nutty.

Oh, my God.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.695
That guy's a doctor!

22:44.488 --> 22:46.198
No. Grace!

22:46.281 --> 22:48.158
[scoffs] You're not as cute
as you think you are.

22:48.241 --> 22:51.745
-Is it because my hand was dancing?
-It's a tremor!

22:51.828 --> 22:53.663
And you've got to get it checked out.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.792
Unbelievable. You are unbelievable!

22:56.875 --> 22:58.752
Oh, no! You're unbelievable!

22:58.835 --> 23:01.797
You have to be tricked
into giving a shit about yourself.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.965
You don't even realize
what you just did to me.

23:04.049 --> 23:08.178
-I was taking care of you!
-You did exactly what the kids did to us!

23:08.261 --> 23:10.639
Yeah, I'm starting to get
where they were coming from

23:10.722 --> 23:12.099
because you are impossible.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.684
She's just worried about you, Kooky.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.353
Well, let me absolve her.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.813
I am not your problem.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.314
If only that were true.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.441
Oh, it is true, starting right now.

23:23.819 --> 23:24.820
[door slams]

23:25.654 --> 23:30.367
I just don't know if I have it in me
to yell at poor Carl for being a dog.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.537
I know he's man's greatest creation,

23:33.620 --> 23:37.416
but do we really have the right
to play God with these creatures?

23:37.499 --> 23:42.003
I mean, they used to be wolves,
for crying out loud.

23:45.632 --> 23:47.175
Sorry, dear. [chuckles]

23:47.259 --> 23:48.385
Did I drift off?

23:48.468 --> 23:50.971
-No, you were dead!
-Not this again...

23:51.054 --> 23:53.640
You are wearing that sleep apnea machine.

23:53.723 --> 23:55.684
I'm not wearing that machine, Sol,

23:55.767 --> 23:58.270
and I'll thank you
not to tell my business to Oliver.

23:58.353 --> 24:01.731
I can't keep worrying that every time
you sleep, you won't wake up.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.650
-Do you wanna die?
-A little bit right now.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.902
-Not funny!
-I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.405
I am not wearing that horrible machine

24:08.488 --> 24:10.699
that makes me feel
even older than I already feel

24:10.782 --> 24:13.869
thanks to Oliver
and his youthful exuberance, okay?

[yells]<i> Anhalten!</i>

24:23.170 --> 24:25.922
For the 900th time,
I'm sorry I told your dad about Evan.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.216
For the 900th time,
I don't wanna talk about it.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.094
-I was just trying to protect you.
-From what? My family?

24:31.178 --> 24:33.388
Yes! He was being awful to you.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.640
He was comparing you unfavorably
to an embezzler.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.643
So what? You did the one thing
I asked you not to do.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.687
You don't think your family
has weird rules?

24:40.770 --> 24:43.064
We've been pretending
your mother's vegan for years.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.484
That's harmless!
You were scratching yourself.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.403
-I can see the rash on your skin.
-Those are normal dad hives.

24:48.487 --> 24:52.240
That's not normal. And if I see
somebody treating you like that,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.743
I'll always step in
and expose family secrets.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.703
Next, your mom's bathroom drinking.

24:56.786 --> 24:59.206
-Wouldn't you drink if you lived with him?
-Yes!

25:00.457 --> 25:03.335
Look, I'm sorry.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.338
I know I shouldn't have done it,

25:06.421 --> 25:08.423
but do you understand why I did?

25:10.258 --> 25:12.427
I understand that I'm not itching anymore.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.348
And I guess it was kind of sexy
when you stood up for me.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.349
Mmm.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.434
A little sexy or a lot sexy?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.686
As sexy as my dad thinks Evan is.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.273
Hmm-mm. [groans]

25:39.746 --> 25:43.333
-Oh, God. Well, that was a disaster.
-Oh, I don't know. I had fun.

25:43.416 --> 25:48.004
My sandwich was good. Joe is looking well,
and Frankie was reliably nuts.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.967
-[stammers] You do realize--
-Yes, Grace. I do.

25:52.050 --> 25:55.303
You and Frankie are a package deal,
and I'm cool with that.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.305
She's got great weed and loves<i> Goonies.</i>

25:58.139 --> 26:00.100
Nick, I'm serious.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.726
So am I.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.773
[inhales] I don't exactly know how
this little threesome is gonna go forward,

26:08.024 --> 26:09.067
but I'm game...

26:12.237 --> 26:13.655
to try and figure it out.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.536
I'd better go apologize to her.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.829
I'll go with you.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.419
Frankie?

26:29.588 --> 26:30.630
Where is she?

26:34.342 --> 26:36.303
I have a pretty good guess.
