01:21.625 --> 01:24.417
Davvers! Davvers! Stop! Cut it!

01:24.417 --> 01:26.833
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:31.542 --> 01:33.750
What is it? Roman stuff?

01:34.125 --> 01:38.167
Can't be Roman. They didn't have kings.
They had emperors and shit.

01:38.292 --> 01:39.708
My mate was on a site last year,

01:39.708 --> 01:42.542
said they found a load of Roman
coins that was worth tons.

01:42.583 --> 01:44.792
It's not fucking Roman, you muppet!(dummy)

01:44.875 --> 01:46.000
It might have other stuff.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.792
- Yeah, like what?
- Gold and stuff.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.542
Ugh... Stinks down here.

02:01.708 --> 02:05.708
- [FARTS] Does now.
- Argh... Davvers!

02:08.458 --> 02:10.875
- Whoa...
- Bloody hell.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.042
It's a graveyard.

02:13.042 --> 02:15.375
It's a plague pit, more like!

02:16.542 --> 02:18.042
We can't nick stuff from a graveyard.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.875
- Can we?
- I don't care.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.958
They dead already, ain't they?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.167
What was that?

02:32.042 --> 02:34.208
Probably just wind or summat.(something)

02:37.333 --> 02:39.333
Jesus! Don't do that!

02:40.250 --> 02:43.792
That was classic. Your face...

02:45.167 --> 02:47.708
We better go...
tell the boss what we found.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.458
What? What's the matter?
You scared of a few skeletons?

02:50.542 --> 02:56.250
Wooah! Wooo! I'm a ghost. Wooooo!
God, you're such a pansy!

02:56.375 --> 02:57.208
Piss off!

03:01.375 --> 03:04.125
- Um, be... behind ja...
- Yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

03:04.125 --> 03:06.250
- Like I'm gonna fall for that one.
- No, seriously. Mate! Behind ja!

03:08.208 --> 03:09.833
Get it off me!

05:06.250 --> 05:08.125
- You paid cash?
- Yeah

05:08.292 --> 05:09.250
Used a false name?

05:09.250 --> 05:10.667
Yes, just like you said.

05:11.583 --> 05:14.000
Where the fuck did you get it, mate?
A bomb site?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.500
Why can't we use our car anyway?

05:15.500 --> 05:17.167
'Cause they'll trace it
back to us, won't they?

05:17.500 --> 05:18.500
This is clean.

05:19.167 --> 05:23.292
If this even starts at all.
Have you tried it?

05:23.875 --> 05:24.917
No.

05:35.292 --> 05:38.000
Okay, Andy, two problems here, uh...
One, it doesn't start.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.667
And two, there's a dirty,
filthy, cummy sock... in there.

05:47.417 --> 05:48.750
Say, let's see what happens.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.667
Oh, yeah!

05:54.750 --> 05:57.708
Come on, let's go and magic
us a full breakfast, yeah?

05:59.917 --> 06:01.167
Look, I'm just saying,

06:01.167 --> 06:03.833
I don't want the van to conk out on us
in the middle of a job, that's all.

06:03.917 --> 06:04.917
Relax, we'll be fine.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.292
Yeah, you say that 'cause
you're a jammy git.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.875
If you fell off that
building right there,

06:08.875 --> 06:10.375
and landed into a thin
bull full of shit,

06:10.417 --> 06:13.292
you'd come out smelling of roses,
with three birds on your arms.

06:13.333 --> 06:16.583
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm a gay Jamaican.(?)
That's talent, ace.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.417
A talent for getting us into trouble.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.833
When have I ever got us into trouble?

06:19.958 --> 06:23.458
Yeah, I'll take you all on! And so will
my fucking brother! You dirty pikeys!(Gipseys)

06:23.458 --> 06:26.583
You do not want to mess with
me and my fucking brother!

06:26.708 --> 06:28.250
- Fucking what?!
- Terry!

06:28.333 --> 06:31.250
Yeah, well, they were asking for it.
I had to stick up for meself.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.583
Look, all I'm saying is that you've
got to be really careful about...

06:33.583 --> 06:35.167
Jesus Christ!

06:43.083 --> 06:45.167
- All right, Mickey?
- Hello, mate.

06:45.417 --> 06:47.208
Why wouldn't I be all right, huh?

06:47.833 --> 06:50.083
You saying I'm some sorta
nutter or something?

06:50.292 --> 06:52.500
No... just saying...

06:53.417 --> 06:55.750
- He's joking.
- Your face...

06:57.792 --> 06:59.583
So, we still on for 2 o'clock or what?

07:02.792 --> 07:04.833
Yeah, that we are.
We are still on for 2 o'clock.

07:04.867 --> 07:07.200
I mean, you've heard what happens
when people mess me about.

07:07.208 --> 07:10.667
Fucking mug! You... fucking mug!

07:10.792 --> 07:12.583
We heard about that, yeah, yeah.

07:12.625 --> 07:13.333
Good.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.750
So, don't mess me about.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.500
Beautiful motor this is, gents.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.417
Oh, cheers, mate, yeah.
It's a nice one, yeah, yeah...

07:21.542 --> 07:23.875
Top of the range, this is, right? Yeah.

07:25.833 --> 07:26.875
RIGHT!

07:30.542 --> 07:32.333
Be lucky, yeah?

07:33.667 --> 07:34.667
Right.

07:35.333 --> 07:36.917
He's just dented my
fucking car with his head.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.208
He's got a steel plate in there.
Iraq war injury.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.042
Buried in there to remove part
of his brain or something.

07:44.042 --> 07:46.625
The part that stops him from
being a fucking psychopath?

07:47.292 --> 07:48.583
"Be lucky".

07:50.542 --> 07:52.208
Mate, he's the man for the job.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.375
- Yeah, you sure?
- He's the man.

07:57.375 --> 08:00.417
Eddie, I told you not to call
this number. It'll leave a record.

08:00.417 --> 08:02.583
They're on to us.
I'll need to move the cash.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.000
Can you get it ready?
I'll send someone over to pick it up.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.792
What? All of it?
But there's two and a ha...

08:06.792 --> 08:10.417
Listen! They're sending inspectors.
I want it all out the away.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.250
You have the forms ready?

08:12.250 --> 08:13.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:18.208 --> 08:21.833
Davvers! Greg! Got a job for ya!

08:24.958 --> 08:28.125
Davvers! Greg!
Where are you, you pair of tits?

08:39.957 --> 08:42.417
Oi! Get the fuck out of it!
You two-bob toe rags(low-life).

08:42.417 --> 08:46.208
I told you! You come 'round here again,
I'm gonna slap the shit out of ya!

08:46.208 --> 08:47.917
Well, now it's time to pay the piper.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.917
Hey, listen, old man.
You behave yourself,

08:49.917 --> 08:52.167
before me and my boys fuck
you up, ja understand?

08:53.208 --> 08:56.583
Leave it out, Ray.
You're driving away all my customers!

08:56.583 --> 08:59.708
You're supposed to take your pills!
Not sell'em to these mugs!

08:59.708 --> 09:01.667
Well, I've got to earn a crust, don't I?

09:05.083 --> 09:06.917
Here you are, lads, gather 'round.

09:07.417 --> 09:11.458
I've got it in here, look.
I've got sleeping pills...

09:11.667 --> 09:13.917
Here they are, slower than the army!

09:13.917 --> 09:15.333
All right, granddad?

09:15.417 --> 09:17.792
Don't call me granddad!
I told you, it makes me sound old!

09:18.250 --> 09:19.083
But you are old.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.667
Yes? How's that for old, eh?

09:21.583 --> 09:24.958
You're late again! The Macguire
genes must have passed youse two by.

09:25.333 --> 09:28.625
Your mum and dad will be spinning in
their graves, God rest their souls.

09:28.833 --> 09:30.875
Yeah, they were cremated though,
weren't they, granddad?

09:30.875 --> 09:32.250
Don't give me none of your back-sass!

09:32.250 --> 09:33.000
All right.

09:33.333 --> 09:36.042
Now, come on! There's people in
there waiting for their dinners!

09:37.667 --> 09:38.500
All right.

09:58.917 --> 09:59.750
- Hello...
- All right, how're you doing?

10:00.042 --> 10:02.542
It's high time youse
two got a proper job.

10:02.542 --> 10:03.958
This is a proper job.

10:03.958 --> 10:07.375
When I was 15, I lied about my age,
so's I could sign up,

10:07.375 --> 10:09.417
and fight the fuckin' Nazis.

10:09.667 --> 10:14.625
Argh! Come on you Nazi mugs!
Let's fucking have it!

10:16.875 --> 10:18.375
What are youse two fighting? Traffic?

10:18.375 --> 10:19.250
We do okay.

10:19.292 --> 10:21.958
Okay? Let me mark your card, sunshine.(correct you)

10:22.875 --> 10:28.417
Delivering 'Meals on Wheels' to old-age
pensioners ain't a lifetime profession.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.917
Look atcha! You're about as much use,
as an ashtray on a motorbike!

10:33.000 --> 10:38.417
Leave 'em alone, Ray! They're doing
the best they can. Aren't you, boys?

10:38.458 --> 10:39.792
Yes, Doreen.

10:40.208 --> 10:44.833
Um, I was wondering,
my window, the catch keeps slipping,

10:44.875 --> 10:48.500
and I was wondering if one of you
big, strong boys could come and...

10:48.500 --> 10:51.042
ooh... force it open?

10:51.458 --> 10:55.167
I think Andy is big and strong. He's up
for fixing a window, aren't you, Andy?

10:55.750 --> 10:59.500
Oh, Andy. Dunno what I'd do without-cha!

10:59.917 --> 11:01.750
Oh... See you later.

11:01.750 --> 11:05.458
See you later, Doreen. Say "bye," Andy.

11:05.458 --> 11:06.458
Bye, Doreen.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.625
- Yeah, mate, mate,
- Mate, mate, mate...

11:08.625 --> 11:10.792
you're gonna get lucky tonight,
I tell you what.

11:10.792 --> 11:12.875
Bit of experience mate, that'll be, won't it?

11:13.583 --> 11:16.125
Every time. Every fucking time.

11:20.833 --> 11:23.750
I know you're gonna be knocking
this place down in a few weeks time,

11:24.208 --> 11:26.250
but do you feel the need to rub it in?

11:26.750 --> 11:30.792
There's people here about to have
their dinner. You yuppie twat!

11:30.875 --> 11:33.583
Look, I really need to get
these measurements, okay?

11:33.917 --> 11:36.208
If you don't sling your
hook(leave) in 5 seconds time,

11:36.250 --> 11:38.708
I'm gonna ram that fucking
clipboard so far up your arris,(arse)

11:39.208 --> 11:41.625
you're gonna have to shove your
pen up your nose to write on it!

11:41.750 --> 11:47.042
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
- All right... All right! All right!

11:50.250 --> 11:51.042
There you go.

11:53.833 --> 11:56.583
All right, Ray?
Is it okay if I sit with you?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.500
You sit where you like, sweetheart.

12:00.875 --> 12:04.792
So, where they sending you
when this place closes?

12:05.500 --> 12:07.917
Oh, some place up north.
Bradford, I suppose.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.792
Somewhere full of northern monkeys.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.542
- It's nice up north.
- I wouldn't know.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.542
I've never been further north
than Walthamstow dog track,

12:17.000 --> 12:18.542
and that's far enough for me.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.042
Do you want this one,
or do you want that one?

12:20.042 --> 12:21.833
Oh, you take that one.
You help yourself.

12:22.250 --> 12:24.292
Are you going to the concert today?

12:25.500 --> 12:27.667
What else am I gonna
do while I'm in here?

12:27.708 --> 12:29.750
Sit around, waiting for the
Grim Reaper to come, and...

12:30.542 --> 12:32.417
put us all out of our misery?

12:33.417 --> 12:34.458
Got any fillet steak?

12:34.458 --> 12:35.708
Just what you see, mate.

12:35.750 --> 12:39.000
Mate? Are you being disrespectful, son?

12:39.000 --> 12:39.875
No, Darryl.

12:39.875 --> 12:42.292
Mr. Cooper is what you call me.

12:42.292 --> 12:45.667
You want to be careful what you say,
I could have you killed.

12:45.667 --> 12:49.625
All your gangster mates are dead.
How're you gonna get someone killed?

12:49.958 --> 12:51.583
Advertise in 'Exchange and Mart'?

12:51.583 --> 12:55.333
I could have you done and all.
I know people, I do.

12:55.667 --> 12:59.167
But go on, hurry up! Me stomach thinks
me "apples and pears" being cut.

12:59.208 --> 13:00.792
Your "stairs" are being cut?

13:00.792 --> 13:02.458
No, me "apples and pears"; me "throat".

13:02.458 --> 13:03.917
"Apples and pears" means "stairs".

13:03.958 --> 13:06.208
Take no notice of him,
he gets everything boxed up.

13:06.208 --> 13:09.000
Apples and pears; cares.
Cares and woes; nose.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.958
Nose in me boat 
(boat=boat race=face);
throat.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.167
Don't you talk English?

13:12.167 --> 13:14.292
Makes sense to me, Eric. There you are.

13:26.083 --> 13:28.292
They don't get better than never.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.125
Lunch, Hamish.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.458
- Come on!
- Oh, all right.

13:37.958 --> 13:39.125
I'd rather have a nap...

13:40.417 --> 13:43.375
- with you.
- Oi! You cheeky bugger.

13:48.583 --> 13:49.417
Yeah, I wouldn't worry.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.500
They're gonna tear the place
down in a couple of weeks.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.917
Yeah. Okay. Speak to them. Bye.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.583
You really think we can do this?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.750
Ain't got a choice, mate.
I mean, look at this idiot.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.500
We don't do anything, this guy is
gonna knock down granddad's care home.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.333
What would mum and dad have done?

14:16.417 --> 14:20.667
Life's gonna throw a lot at you, 'cause
of who you are, where you're from.

14:20.667 --> 14:24.125
See, some people don't respect us,
the working class.

14:24.958 --> 14:28.583
Don't you dare, ever,
let anyone put you down, all right?

14:29.542 --> 14:31.542
You can be anything you want,

14:31.542 --> 14:35.208
long as you work hard,
stick together as a family.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.167
Always stand up for what's right, yeah?

14:39.167 --> 14:41.000
Now, look, we've gotta
pop out for a minute,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
so you two behave yourselves, all right?

14:45.917 --> 14:46.667
Here you go.

14:51.833 --> 14:54.708
- You ready, Shirl?
- Ready.

14:58.208 --> 15:00.125
Come on, you fucking pigs!

15:00.125 --> 15:02.542
Come on! You'll never take us alive!

15:02.958 --> 15:05.958
Probably not the best role models
for the current situation, Andrew.

15:09.792 --> 15:12.000
I think they'd be all right with it.

15:14.583 --> 15:17.417
<i>An East London building
site has been shut down,</i>

15:17.417 --> 15:20.417
<i>after several workers were
injured, earlier today.</i>

15:20.417 --> 15:23.333
<i>Police have not revealed
the details of the accident,</i>

15:23.333 --> 15:25.375
<i>but a Department of
Health spokesperson...</i>

15:25.375 --> 15:27.667
Right, let's get the van
and pick up the others.

15:29.542 --> 15:32.292
I think maybe we should have picked
something easier than a bank.

15:32.542 --> 15:35.292
Nah, we'll be fine.
Davey will look after us.

15:54.375 --> 15:55.125
You getting in, then?

15:55.125 --> 15:57.083
Yeah, yeah, just keeping a low profile.

15:57.167 --> 15:58.500
We ain't done anything yet, mate.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.167
Yeah, well, it's just,
tricks of the trade and all that.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.042
All right, now, my guy on the inside,

16:11.042 --> 16:13.125
he said that they were
upgrading their security.

16:13.375 --> 16:17.500
So, today, there's no security shots.
But the alarms are on and they all work.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.583
Did you get the outfits?

16:19.583 --> 16:21.083
Yeah, blagged(stole) them
from the building site.

16:21.083 --> 16:21.917
Sweet.

16:31.833 --> 16:32.958
You're late, as usual.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.333
Yeah, nice to see you too.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.625
- All right, Kate?
- Katy, not Kate, Katy.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.125
- All right, Kate Grand lives on.
- Oh...

16:38.125 --> 16:42.000
Excuse me for expecting someone in my
own family to remember my fucking name.

16:48.417 --> 16:49.917
- They let you out then?
- Yeah.
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,917
Lost your virginity, yet?

16:53.250 --> 16:55.000
Davey Tuppence? You having a laugh?

16:55.000 --> 16:55.958
He's our expert.

16:55.958 --> 16:58.667
Expert?
What sort of an expert gets caught?

17:00.125 --> 17:01.917
Now, you've got to be really
tough to do this sort of work.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.375
- Really?
- Yeah, double tough.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.833
Do you, uh, wanna see some of my scars?

17:07.875 --> 17:10.208
- Yeah, yeah, I'd love to.
- Of course you do, babe.

17:11.208 --> 17:12.375
Oh, bollocks.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.333
It's the best we can do at
short notice, all right?

17:15.416 --> 17:18.291
You said, it'll just be the three of us.
In and out, no complications.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.583
Yes, no complications.

17:19.583 --> 17:22.208
But, we need as much help as possible
to make sure things go smoothly.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.708
That's why I'm here.

17:27.750 --> 17:30.042
- Which one is Mickey's?
- Mental Mickey?

17:31.250 --> 17:32.500
Oh, this just gets better and better.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.500
He's the only person that we knew
that had access to guns, all right?

17:35.917 --> 17:38.458
You said no shooting.
We can't afford to get caught with guns.

17:38.708 --> 17:40.625
They're just for show. All right?

17:41.958 --> 17:48.083
He' not mental. He's just got a few...
anger management issues, that's all.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.250
Issues? He's a fucking psycho!

17:50.292 --> 17:53.417
I heard he pulled a geezer's
spine out and wore it as a belt.

17:54.167 --> 17:56.042
Great, I feel much better now.

18:04.042 --> 18:04.917
All right, mate.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.500
Here he comes.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.250
Oi! Princess, move.

18:24.375 --> 18:25.792
See you brought me a bird, then?

18:25.792 --> 18:28.125
Who the fuck you calling
a bird, you prick?!

18:28.208 --> 18:30.500
Fuck you calling a prick, you shitter?

18:30.542 --> 18:35.208
- Whoa! Easy... easy...
- Katy is our cousin. She's a locksmith.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.250
And this is Davey Tuppence.

18:38.542 --> 18:39.375
Yeah, I've heard of him.

18:39.375 --> 18:40.458
Got a bit of a reputation, don't I?

18:40.625 --> 18:42.292
I heard you're a bit of a muppet, bruv(bro).

18:45.917 --> 18:47.875
It's a good job I'm sorting
out of shaving his head.
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:52,000
Gimme your opinion about these.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.208
Ah, beautiful.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.542
Now this... is my baby.

18:57.167 --> 19:00.125
It's a Remington 870 Express
12-gauge pump-action shotgun...

19:00.125 --> 19:01.875
with a tactical pistol grip.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.667
Takes eight 3-inch magnum shells.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.042
Her name's Tracy.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.458
She's pretty.

19:12.167 --> 19:13.500
Fucking hell.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.958
Now, let's go fuck up
some fuckers, yeah?

19:53.042 --> 19:56.458
Ooh, there's something funny
going on at the building site.

19:59.708 --> 20:01.708
Katy, don't look at me
like that, for fuck's sake.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.833
Yes, I should have told you
about the guns, all right?

20:03.833 --> 20:05.000
But I'll drop you off, if you want.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.250
No chance. I ain't leaving you
two alone with these divs.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.250
Someone's got to keep you alive.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.333
Shit!

20:13.500 --> 20:14.917
Rats.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.458
Lots of rats.

20:20.708 --> 20:22.208
I wonder where they're going.

20:22.375 --> 20:25.333
Down a pub for a pint.
Who gives a fuck? Just drive through.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.333
Mate, they're just gonna clog up
the wheels. There's no point.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.583
We've got plenty of time, all right?
Now, listen,

20:29.833 --> 20:31.208
you do know what you're doing, yeah?

20:31.208 --> 20:31.958
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.417
Right, perfect, listen to this.
This is the most important part, Mickey.

20:34.917 --> 20:35.833
No shooting.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.167
If it takes longer than 3 minutes,
then we just get out of there.

20:38.333 --> 20:39.917
Shouldn't we be wearing disguises?

20:39.917 --> 20:42.208
Aha!.. Sorted! Right?

20:43.917 --> 20:47.042
- What's that?
- Well, it's a moustache.

20:47.500 --> 20:51.208
I can see it's a fucking moustache.
Are you expecting me to wear one?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.375
Well, why not?

20:52.375 --> 20:54.958
Put your glasses on, pull your hat down.
No one will know the difference.

20:54.958 --> 20:56.667
I've got tits, you teat!

20:57.292 --> 21:03.125
Well, no offense, they're not... that
big, so, it'll probably be all right.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.417
Last chance to call it off.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.167
Nah, come on, let's go.

21:43.875 --> 21:46.917
Now, when we get in there,
I'll make the announcement, right?

21:47.333 --> 21:49.667
And then, you'll make as much
fucking noise as possible, you know.

21:49.667 --> 21:50.667
Really put a frightness on.

21:50.708 --> 21:52.708
Yeah, that's music to my ears, Tuppence.

21:53.417 --> 21:54.250
Come on.

21:56.208 --> 21:58.833
You need your own deposit slips.
It's bank policy.

21:59.167 --> 22:02.542
Look, I just... You know me.
You know my account.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.375
Why're you making this difficult, Clive?

22:04.375 --> 22:06.250
I wish I could help,
but my hands are tied.

22:06.542 --> 22:10.792
I suggest you go back to your...
bedsit, rifle through your drawers...

22:10.792 --> 22:12.542
How dare you? How dare you?

22:12.917 --> 22:14.792
Come on, Davey, say something.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.250
Let's just fucking shoot everyone.

22:16.292 --> 22:17.250
Let's start with you, eh?

22:20.583 --> 22:22.583
Are you here for the money, then?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.917
Yes, we are here about the money, um...

22:26.917 --> 22:28.167
And we don't want any
trouble, all right?

22:28.500 --> 22:31.125
Oh, no, no, it's no trouble at all.
I assure you.

22:31.125 --> 22:32.500
Would you like to come this way?

22:35.917 --> 22:38.000
- What's going on?
- I have no fucking idea.

22:44.208 --> 22:47.833
I wasn't expecting so many of you,
but, um, a couple of you can sit down.

22:48.958 --> 22:51.625
Now, if I could just see your forms,
we can get you that money.

22:52.083 --> 22:56.667
- Forms?
- The C114 and 27B/6.

23:00.292 --> 23:02.792
You are from Heartman
Construction, aren't you?

23:04.250 --> 23:05.083
Yep.

23:05.083 --> 23:08.333
Right, it's just that Eddie
said you'd have the forms.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.583
He said he'd bring them later.

23:10.583 --> 23:13.875
Okay, well, I can't release
the money without the forms.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.958
All right, stop the Lilly Law, will ya?

23:15.958 --> 23:17.917
We ain't got your
fucking forms, all right?

23:18.375 --> 23:21.708
But, I've got this, you soppy* bitch.
Now, where's the fucking money?
*(moist w/vaginal emissions)

23:22.042 --> 23:23.833
I'll give you the money,
just please don't hurt me.

23:23.917 --> 23:26.167
- Get up!
- Not you, Davey.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.625
Look for about ten grey security bags,

23:31.625 --> 23:33.375
should be a couple of hundred
grand in there easy.

23:39.917 --> 23:40.833
Move.

23:51.500 --> 23:55.875
Right, so, if we take two
bags each, then, uh...

24:05.000 --> 24:06.167
What's all this?

24:07.083 --> 24:11.083
Two and a half million. All of Heartman
Construction's payroll and profit.

24:11.917 --> 24:15.958
- Fuck me.
- Granddad's gonna kill us.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.292
That's too much.
Old Bill will never stop chasing us.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.750
Too much? You having a fucking
jill-off? (masturbate)
We can retire right now.

24:21.167 --> 24:23.208
Retire? You don't even
have a fucking job.

24:23.208 --> 24:24.417
This is my fucking job!

24:26.625 --> 24:29.958
I mean... we're here, you know,
might as well take it.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.875
Let's do it.

24:34.208 --> 24:35.167
Andy.

24:58.667 --> 24:59.500
Jesus!

25:00.250 --> 25:03.042
We're gonna go down in history.
Easiest armed robbery ever.

25:05.750 --> 25:09.000
<i>Drop your weapons,
and get down on the ground!</i>

25:09.583 --> 25:10.625
<i>On the ground! Now!</i>

25:17.667 --> 25:19.792
Come on, you fucking sluts!

25:20.875 --> 25:21.708
Get down!

25:32.417 --> 25:33.583
Stop shooting, Mickey!

25:33.583 --> 25:37.875
They were gonna fucking nick us, right!
We ain't got time for a pussy fallback!

25:37.958 --> 25:40.042
Can't we just say, it was a mistake and
we didn't mean it. No hard feelings.

25:40.167 --> 25:42.333
Well, it doesn't fucking work
like that, does it, Andy?!

25:42.333 --> 25:43.500
Ain't there a back door?!

25:43.500 --> 25:44.500
Shit, we're trapped.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.000
No, we ain't marked off yet.

25:48.417 --> 25:52.583
Everybody, get down! This is a robbery!

25:52.583 --> 25:53.333
Shut up!

25:54.375 --> 25:56.542
Fill up them security bags,
before I blow your fucking head off!

25:56.625 --> 25:59.000
You want more?! There's two and
a half million quid outside!

25:59.042 --> 26:01.500
This is easier to carry.
We gotta run now!

26:01.542 --> 26:03.000
- Terry.
- What?! Mickey! what?!

26:03.083 --> 26:04.667
I'm gonna get us out of here!

26:04.667 --> 26:07.167
Fucking hell, mate!
I don't fucking think so!

26:07.167 --> 26:08.917
You lost you fucking marbles?
Give that back!

26:08.917 --> 26:10.833
Fuck off, mate! You let this off,
we're all fucking dead!

26:11.083 --> 26:13.167
Just back off and let
me think for a second!

26:13.417 --> 26:16.167
<i>Come out with your hands on your head,
and you won't be harmed!</i>

26:17.333 --> 26:19.500
Suck my fucking chocolate dick!

26:49.583 --> 26:51.458
Fucking hell!

26:52.667 --> 26:54.292
Are you all right? Oh, my God!

26:54.417 --> 26:55.542
What's going on?

26:59.417 --> 27:01.792
Everybody out the front door!
Everybody out!

27:02.125 --> 27:03.167
What are you doing?!

27:04.875 --> 27:06.875
Outside! Outside!

27:09.167 --> 27:10.500
Have some of this, twinkle toes.

27:20.625 --> 27:23.125
Peggy! Peggy! Come on!

27:26.500 --> 27:28.375
Tuppence, you're the expert,
go and have a look.

27:28.375 --> 27:29.417
I'm not looking. You look.

27:29.458 --> 27:31.208
- Andy, go and have a look.
- What?

27:31.208 --> 27:32.417
I can't see through this glass, mate.

27:35.542 --> 27:37.833
Out of the way, wankers, move.
I'll sort this out.

27:39.208 --> 27:41.958
Ow! Ow! Get off me, you big dickbag!

27:41.958 --> 27:42.958
Don't try any funny shit.

27:42.958 --> 27:44.917
What the fuck are you doing?!
We're not taking any hostages!

27:44.917 --> 27:45.750
No, it's a bad idea.

27:45.875 --> 27:46.958
Maybe you ain't,

27:47.292 --> 27:50.917
- but I am. Up!
- Oh, no.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.042
I'm no use as a hostage.
I have a heart condition.

27:53.167 --> 27:54.458
I can drop dead if I get stressed.

27:54.875 --> 27:56.708
Stay calm then, you muppet.

27:58.417 --> 28:02.250
Right! We're coming out!
And we've got hostages! Move!

28:05.500 --> 28:06.500
Might as well follow him now.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.833
1, 2, 3, wait, 4!

28:35.000 --> 28:37.042
And that can fuck right off!

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
- Mickey!
- What's going on?

28:45.208 --> 28:47.958
- Zombies.
- Are you sure?

28:52.708 --> 28:54.125
Pretty sure.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.458
He's eating a foot!

28:58.333 --> 29:00.167
It's fucking disgusting.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.583
Fuck this. All right, grab the money.
Grab the money!

29:08.583 --> 29:10.667
All right, let's get into the van!

29:15.542 --> 29:18.083
Andy, come on, hurry up!
Put the bags in the back!

29:22.875 --> 29:23.625
Come on.

29:24.167 --> 29:27.125
Please! Don't leave me
here with these things!

29:27.125 --> 29:30.250
- Andy, get in the van!
- Andy, get in here!

29:31.875 --> 29:34.792
What're you doing?!
Jesus fucking Christ!

29:35.125 --> 29:36.542
I couldn't just
leave her, could I?!

29:36.875 --> 29:39.625
- Drive!
- I can't start the fucking van!

29:41.333 --> 29:42.500
Unbelievable.

30:04.625 --> 30:05.458
How are you?

30:07.500 --> 30:08.375
She's dead!

30:09.125 --> 30:10.500
What's going on?! What's going on?!

30:10.500 --> 30:13.000
- She's dead!
- Fucking get rid of her then!

30:14.583 --> 30:16.917
Hands off me, you mental bitch!

30:22.875 --> 30:24.458
Mental, do something!

30:28.667 --> 30:31.417
Say "hello" to Tracy, you shitbag!

30:36.083 --> 30:36.958
Yes!

30:38.417 --> 30:39.833
Sorry, Terry, I put her in.
That's my bad.

30:39.917 --> 30:42.292
Mickey, don't ever fire
that gun indoors again!

30:42.292 --> 30:46.458
You see that, Tuppence?! Told you, mate!
Nobody messes with my Tracy. Mwah.

30:50.125 --> 30:51.750
What the fuck was that?!

30:52.375 --> 30:55.000
Why didn't you check to make sure
they didn't put a dye pack in?

30:55.458 --> 30:56.292
What's a dye pack?!

30:56.292 --> 30:58.500
The thing that just exploded.
That's a dye pack!

30:58.625 --> 31:00.750
Calm down! We'll be there in a minute!

31:13.042 --> 31:15.250
Let's lock the bleeding doors!

31:15.250 --> 31:17.042
Where do we go now? Upstairs?

31:17.042 --> 31:20.625
- No, we'll be fucked, up there! Um...
- Oh... Where?

31:21.042 --> 31:22.750
- Back door!
- Back door, right.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.417
Come on, let's go.

31:44.583 --> 31:46.250
We can't go that way either.

31:49.792 --> 31:51.458
Peggy, kick him.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.708
The bastards are everywhere.

32:00.333 --> 32:03.750
Eric, shut that door!
Darryl, drum those shut!

32:03.750 --> 32:07.333
Doreen, lock that back door!
Close everything!

32:18.000 --> 32:21.083
All right, Tuppence, here you go.
Close the gate. Go on, son.

32:29.125 --> 32:33.042
All right, Andy, Katy, grab the bags!
You two muppets, in there!

32:38.083 --> 32:40.125
Aah! I've got a gun.

32:42.667 --> 32:43.625
A little slow.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.417
Is that as fast as they go?

32:47.875 --> 32:49.875
I thought they run really quick.

32:50.042 --> 32:52.750
Mate, they're dead. They're not
exactly gonna sprint, are they?

32:55.042 --> 32:57.000
Fine, come on then, you fucking muppet!

33:01.792 --> 33:04.875
Oh yeah, hard guy, are ya?
Have some of this then, you prick!

33:10.167 --> 33:11.750
That's how you do it.

33:13.708 --> 33:16.833
Owww! He fucking bit me!

33:16.833 --> 33:18.250
You've gotta get them in the head.

33:18.250 --> 33:19.958
Shut up. How'd you even know that?

33:19.958 --> 33:21.458
Everyone knows that.

33:25.417 --> 33:26.208
Come here.

33:39.542 --> 33:41.458
Is that even actually possible?

33:42.625 --> 33:43.667
You've pulled my fucking skin off.

33:44.125 --> 33:46.125
Can't exactly leave it there, can ya?

33:46.583 --> 33:50.000
- Oh...
- What? Whoa, there's another one!

33:53.250 --> 33:54.708
What the fuck?

34:05.208 --> 34:08.667
- Oh!
- Oh, rot!

34:12.417 --> 34:13.667
Come here, little fella.

34:13.667 --> 34:14.958
Easy, mate, come on.

34:15.917 --> 34:17.833
Is it all right? Awww...

34:21.833 --> 34:23.000
Oi! You little shit.

34:26.542 --> 34:30.958
No, too much! Too fucking
much in one day, surely!

34:32.083 --> 34:33.375
Never liked kids anyway.

34:36.125 --> 34:37.542
Okay, get in!

34:38.667 --> 34:40.917
Right, Andy, Tuppence,
put the bags there and there!

34:41.292 --> 34:43.750
Katy! Get on the phone and try and
get a hold of anyone, all right?

34:43.750 --> 34:45.292
- Get in the chair!
- Sit down.

34:45.292 --> 34:46.542
Don't move.

34:47.875 --> 34:49.875
Mickey, you all right, mate?
Your arm looks a little bit dodgy.

34:49.917 --> 34:51.917
Yeah, bruv. Fucking good as gold, bruv.

34:52.708 --> 34:55.583
So, no shooting and no hostages.
Job well done, boys.

34:55.583 --> 34:59.250
Don't blame me, trick, oh yeah?!
The pigs come! I improvised!

34:59.250 --> 35:00.833
- And fucked your ear, eh?
- Easy.

35:00.833 --> 35:01.875
- Fuck you.
- Relax.

35:02.958 --> 35:05.167
So... shall we jump in
the car and head off then?

35:05.167 --> 35:07.583
No, no, no, we can't just go running off
until we know exactly what's happened,

35:07.583 --> 35:10.000
all right? This...
wasn't exactly part of the plan.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.750
Nothing... shit reception.
Worse than New Year's eve.

35:12.750 --> 35:15.125
- Shit!
- Have you tried the radio?

35:17.042 --> 35:19.667
- What?
- The radio.

35:20.125 --> 35:21.458
We ain't got a radio.

35:22.708 --> 35:24.708
Yeah, you have a radio in the van.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.625
No, she's right.
You was listening to Dido.

35:29.958 --> 35:31.333
Yeah, all right,
I'll go check it out, um...

35:31.417 --> 35:32.792
- I'll come with ya.
- Yeah.

35:33.292 --> 35:36.083
You, keep an eye on them.
Watch Mr. Bean, all right?

35:49.750 --> 35:52.542
Mental's been bitten. He's gonna
turn into one of those things.

35:52.542 --> 35:53.667
Yeah, he's still alive though.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.833
Doesn't matter. His arm's
going grey. He's gonna turn.

35:55.833 --> 35:57.167
He's a fucking liability.

35:57.167 --> 35:59.042
- What're you saying?
- He needs to be shot.

35:59.042 --> 36:01.833
Fucking hell, Katy!
You're a bit eager to shoot people.

36:01.875 --> 36:03.000
Look, I don't want to shoot people,

36:03.000 --> 36:04.625
but I'll happily shoot
somebody who's already dead.

36:04.625 --> 36:05.708
He's not fucking dead!

36:05.708 --> 36:07.917
Fine! Don't say I didn't
warn you when he turns.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.292
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

36:12.292 --> 36:15.417
<i>There is a viral infection concentrated
on the East End of London,</i>

36:15.417 --> 36:17.250
<i>and spreading fast through the capital.</i>

36:18.000 --> 36:21.750
<i>The army have sealed off the East
End to try and contain the virus...</i>

36:23.583 --> 36:26.083
- What are you up to later?
- What?

36:26.417 --> 36:29.208
Well, you fancy maybe coming to
get a drink with me or something.

36:29.917 --> 36:33.542
Are you out of your mind?
You just kidnapped me.

36:33.833 --> 36:36.292
You threatened me with guns.
You've put me in danger.

36:36.708 --> 36:39.958
Yeah, sorry about that. I mean some
girls are into that sort of thing.

36:41.208 --> 36:44.833
Not you, obviously. Uh, I just mean...

36:45.083 --> 36:47.042
- Some girls.
- No!

36:47.708 --> 36:49.542
- Davey, probably not.
- Sorry.

37:00.333 --> 37:01.250
Cheers, mate.

37:01.250 --> 37:04.167
I'm keeping track of all this,
so I can write a report for the police.

37:04.583 --> 37:06.042
I'm memorising your faces.

37:06.042 --> 37:08.167
Put a sock in it, you little cretin!

37:08.250 --> 37:10.708
Hey, I'm doing this for
your benefit too, you know?

37:10.875 --> 37:12.250
Why don't we just let them go.

37:12.250 --> 37:13.583
Shut it, Davey!

37:13.583 --> 37:18.000
Davey, is that your name? Right.
I made a note of that.

37:18.333 --> 37:20.000
Oh, great. Thanks, Mickey.

37:20.792 --> 37:23.125
Mickey. Right. Another name.

37:23.417 --> 37:25.333
Remembering everything,
are ya?

37:25.333 --> 37:27.792
Yes, every tiny detail.

37:30.500 --> 37:35.250
Well, don't forget this then.
Keep your fucking airhole shut!

37:38.250 --> 37:40.292
- Well, what is it?
- Yeah, zombies.

37:40.292 --> 37:41.167
Shitloads of 'em.

37:41.167 --> 37:42.917
Yeah, some kind of
mutated virus or something.

37:42.917 --> 37:45.208
I dunno when it started,
but it's spreading fast.

37:45.208 --> 37:47.667
Maybe... it's something in the water.

37:47.958 --> 37:50.375
- Christ, Andy!
- It's not fucking water.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.750
They're gonna seal off the East
End to see if they can contain it.

37:52.750 --> 37:54.250
Told everyone to just stay indoors.

37:54.292 --> 37:56.250
Yes, and whatever you do, do not
let 'em fucking bite you, all right?

37:56.250 --> 37:58.167
That's where it starts.

38:02.125 --> 38:03.083
We've got a problem.

38:03.083 --> 38:05.875
We've come this far 'cause we've got
guns and we're strong, all right?

38:06.542 --> 38:08.250
But what about granddad?

38:08.250 --> 38:11.250
He can handle anything.
He was in the war.

38:11.250 --> 38:14.208
I know that, mate. But this is a little
bit different. You know what I mean?

38:14.208 --> 38:16.667
I think... I think even granddad's
gonna have a tough time with this one.

38:16.667 --> 38:19.667
We have to go there. Keep him
safe till all of this get sorted.

38:19.667 --> 38:20.417
Yep.

38:21.583 --> 38:25.458
Okay, they can't get in.
But, we can't get out.

38:25.542 --> 38:28.583
Now, we just gonna have to stay here,
until we figure summat.

38:28.917 --> 38:31.000
Or the bastards bash
the bloody doors down.

38:31.083 --> 38:34.167
Don't say that.
We'll work something out.

38:34.250 --> 38:36.167
Look, what the bloody hell are they?

38:36.167 --> 38:38.292
It's obvious, innit? They're vampires!

38:38.542 --> 38:41.708
Then what we need is crucifixes, silver,

38:41.708 --> 38:44.917
garlic, holy water, and Chrisopher Lee.

38:45.292 --> 38:49.875
Oh, shut up! You soppy tart. Those
things out there... are fucking zombies!

39:02.375 --> 39:04.792
It's probably not as bad as it looks.

39:05.917 --> 39:07.958
I think it probably is, mate.

39:13.125 --> 39:15.125
We are going to be all
right, aren't we, Ray?

39:15.208 --> 39:16.625
Yeah, of course we are, sweetheart.

39:16.708 --> 39:22.125
Listen. If one of 'em bites me,
you will sort me out, won't you?

39:22.167 --> 39:25.458
Yeah, I'll promise, really.
But, uh... it won't come to that.

39:26.167 --> 39:27.417
Thanks, Ray.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.542
Same goes for me.
If one of them fuckers bites me...

39:32.583 --> 39:33.917
you finish me off.

39:33.917 --> 39:37.083
You joking?
I'll kill you stone fucking dead.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.375
Eh?

39:38.375 --> 39:42.667
We're in enough trouble without you
turning into one of them as well.

39:44.083 --> 39:44.917
Yeah.

39:51.167 --> 39:54.458
Don't worry about it.
Just a little scratch.

39:55.875 --> 39:57.333
Won't kill me, bruv.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.458
Honestly, Mickey.
Maybe you need to get to a hospital.

40:00.458 --> 40:03.292
Maybe you should shut your
fucking mouth. How about that?

40:04.792 --> 40:08.458
Please, we've done everything you
asked us. You don't need us any more.

40:09.417 --> 40:11.500
She's right. We should let them go.

40:11.708 --> 40:14.667
Fuck off!
We just half-inched(pinched)
2 million quid.

40:14.667 --> 40:16.750
As soon as we let them go,
they'll snitch on us.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.625
Oh, no, we won't say a word.

40:18.625 --> 40:19.833
I will. I'll tell 'em everything.

40:19.833 --> 40:23.292
Jesus, Clive! Shut up! Christ!

40:23.500 --> 40:27.250
Fine, just me then. I won't say a word.

40:27.917 --> 40:30.042
Look, the world is
clearly going to shit.

40:30.375 --> 40:32.833
Do you think I care about
your poxy little robbery?

40:35.792 --> 40:38.125
My sister's ill, I need
to check up on her.

40:38.625 --> 40:39.917
I don't expect you lot to understand.

40:39.917 --> 40:42.375
You clearly don't care about
anything other than yourselves.

40:42.875 --> 40:46.708
Why'd you say that for?
Have we said anything nasty to you?

40:47.042 --> 40:47.917
You kidnapped me!

40:47.917 --> 40:49.667
Do you know why we're doing this?

40:49.958 --> 40:52.000
No, and I don't care.

40:53.125 --> 40:55.542
They're closing down our
granddad's old people's home.

40:55.542 --> 40:57.292
He's lived in the East End all his life.

40:57.333 --> 41:00.417
We're doing this so he can
stay here with his friends.

41:08.583 --> 41:10.750
I, uh... All I just need
is to clear me debts.

41:10.750 --> 41:12.417
Lost all me rent money on a racehorse.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.542
What? I thought we were sharing.

41:23.375 --> 41:26.375
I know it's hard to believe. But we've
actually never robbed anything before.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.625
Huh, no shit.

41:28.042 --> 41:30.500
When we was young,
our mum and dad died and...

41:30.500 --> 41:33.333
granddad raised us so...
you know... we owe him.

41:33.333 --> 41:34.625
Why didn't you just save up?

41:34.667 --> 41:36.417
We did, for six months.

41:36.833 --> 41:38.958
And then someone broke into
our flat and nicked it.

41:38.958 --> 41:39.792
You think that's funny, do ya?

41:39.792 --> 41:41.083
It's pathetic.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.833
Sorry to break up you
lot's fucking little orgy.

41:46.458 --> 41:48.958
You're getting too pally
pally for my liking.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.583
You are telling them too much about us.

41:54.458 --> 41:57.708
All right, Andy, I want you to light up
the car, all right? What you doing?

41:59.667 --> 42:01.625
- Gimme my keys.
- Nah.

42:01.625 --> 42:02.958
Gimme my fucking keys!

42:02.958 --> 42:06.458
Think I'll hang on to these, in case
you try to run off with my money.

42:07.333 --> 42:09.333
But it's not that I
don't trust you, Ter.

42:09.333 --> 42:12.583
It's that I don't fucking trust you.

42:15.875 --> 42:18.208
Yeah, think Imma shove him over there.

42:18.208 --> 42:19.875
Don't make us go with him.

42:19.917 --> 42:21.750
- Get up now!
- I'm up, I'm up.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.583
- Guys, come on.
- Move!

42:24.750 --> 42:27.125
- Moving.
- Take it easy.

42:30.167 --> 42:31.917
You can't just let him take 'em.

42:33.958 --> 42:35.042
What the fuck are we gonna do?

42:35.042 --> 42:36.708
He ain't got much longer,
you know that, right?

42:36.708 --> 42:37.958
He's fucking lost his mind.

42:37.958 --> 42:40.708
So what are we gonna do?
He's gonna turn any minute, right?

42:46.542 --> 42:48.000
Wait.

42:49.625 --> 42:51.125
In there.

42:58.208 --> 42:59.792
Fucking mag mug!(vomitous)

43:30.125 --> 43:32.042
- Now, get in.
- Yup, okay.

43:32.792 --> 43:35.917
You should be safe in there now...
probably...

43:38.375 --> 43:42.500
I can't believe they got Hamish.
He's only 83.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.875
Oh, I'm so glad I didn't see it.

43:44.875 --> 43:47.792
Did anyone actually see Hamish
in the room when it happened?

43:47.792 --> 43:52.000
He went out in the garden
to have a kip (nap), but
I never saw him come back in.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.333
Fuck! He must have
slept right through it.

44:07.542 --> 44:08.875
There's zombies everywhere.

44:08.875 --> 44:10.833
Yeah, but they ain't bite him yet.

44:11.583 --> 44:14.792
Hamish! Wake up!

44:16.042 --> 44:18.042
Wake up! You silly old fucker!

44:25.583 --> 44:27.458
What are you all doing in there?

44:27.625 --> 44:29.542
Don't talk, they'll hear you.

44:29.875 --> 44:33.167
I'm sorry, I... I can't hear.
You'll have to speak up!

44:33.542 --> 44:37.333
Shut up! Come to the back door.
We'll let you in.

44:38.625 --> 44:40.708
Pardon?

44:42.292 --> 44:47.208
There's zombies everywhere. Come to
the back door, and we'll let you in.

44:47.917 --> 44:49.792
Run! Now!

44:49.792 --> 44:51.792
Oh, it doesnt' work. I can't hear you.

44:51.792 --> 44:56.083
You'll have to... hold on.
I'll... I'll come over there.

44:59.958 --> 45:02.625
He's Mutt 'n Jeff,
deaf as a fucking post!

45:02.625 --> 45:05.708
He'd move a bit quicker
if it was dinner time.

45:07.292 --> 45:11.333
Hamish, there's a zombie right
behind you! Move! Right now!

45:12.167 --> 45:15.292
Zombie, eh? Zombie?
What are you going on about?

45:15.833 --> 45:18.500
Oh, my, oh. Oh, it's a zombie, oh.

45:18.500 --> 45:21.958
RUUUUUN!

45:27.500 --> 45:29.917
Why're you going so fast? Ey-oh!

45:33.333 --> 45:34.250
Fuck!

45:38.792 --> 45:44.458
Zombies, oh, no, oh, oh, oh, eh, eh.

46:18.667 --> 46:19.833
You don't look very well.

46:20.833 --> 46:24.000
- Me?
- No, Clive. Him.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.792
Why don't I come over
there and untie you.

46:28.792 --> 46:31.208
I'll show you how fucking well I am.

46:35.083 --> 46:36.042
Look, I'm serious, um...

46:37.292 --> 46:40.917
Why don't you untie us, and...
and we'll take you to a hospital, huh?

46:43.750 --> 46:46.125
Ain't going nowhere.

46:47.583 --> 46:48.833
I said I'm fine.

47:10.625 --> 47:12.375
Get it out of it!

47:19.625 --> 47:20.875
He's not gonna make it.

47:20.917 --> 47:23.292
We've got to help him, somehow.

47:26.708 --> 47:29.208
Summat's gotta be done!
I'm gonna go and get him!

47:29.250 --> 47:31.792
Eric, gonna have to
borrow your wheels, mate.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.958
Oh, be careful! You're gonna break
me "trouble-and-strife" (wife)!

47:35.000 --> 47:36.042
Shall I come with you?

47:36.042 --> 47:39.667
Peggy, youse guys kick the back
door clear. I'll bring him back in.

47:41.333 --> 47:42.667
Come on, Eric.

47:52.083 --> 47:53.833
Take care of this one, Peggy!

47:58.417 --> 47:59.708
Hamish!

48:07.375 --> 48:09.167
And you can fuck off and all.

48:11.375 --> 48:12.875
Hamish, get in.

48:15.333 --> 48:16.667
Bring your friend with ya.

49:12.417 --> 49:13.708
- Yeah, I'll cover you from here.
- Come with me, mate.

49:13.708 --> 49:15.125
- I'll cover you from here.
- Andy?

49:21.167 --> 49:22.792
- Take your time, mate.
- Sorry, mate.

49:22.792 --> 49:24.417
I've been waiting for bloody...

49:25.250 --> 49:26.167
Fuck! Get off! Get off!

49:26.167 --> 49:27.792
Here, I'll shoot it! I'll shoot it!

49:27.792 --> 49:31.167
Terry! Quick!

49:47.250 --> 49:49.125
You all right, mate? Did he bite ya?

49:49.125 --> 49:51.500
No, mate, I swear to ya.

49:51.500 --> 49:53.542
All right, let's close this.

49:59.083 --> 50:00.875
Oh, great, another one.

50:01.458 --> 50:03.208
Fucking hell, that is mingin'.

50:03.250 --> 50:04.000
Use your gun.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.625
Nah, I'm gonna take a gun in it's face.

50:05.667 --> 50:07.583
Might be just better to shoot it.

50:07.583 --> 50:08.625
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:13.667 --> 50:14.583
How'd you fucking turn it on?!

50:14.583 --> 50:15.833
Safety catch!

50:16.125 --> 50:18.750
- Where?!
- Oh, for fuck's sake, there!

50:19.500 --> 50:22.375
- Otherwise it ain't gonna work.
- Thanks.

50:24.667 --> 50:26.208
Can you get free, Clive?

50:26.500 --> 50:29.167
- No, it's too tight.
- Oh, great.

50:29.833 --> 50:31.500
Hang on, I can get loose.

50:31.542 --> 50:34.333
Oh, oh, great, let me see, let me see.

50:34.333 --> 50:36.208
- I'm doing a knot.
- Twizzle, twizzle.

50:36.417 --> 50:37.625
Let me have a look. Let me have a look.

50:38.125 --> 50:39.833
- Oh, that's it, that's it.
- Chew the knot.

50:40.083 --> 50:41.125
Oh, okay, let me try and bite it.

50:41.125 --> 50:43.000
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.458
- Okay, a little bit to the left.
- Yeah.

50:44.542 --> 50:48.000
Oh... you can do it. You can do...

50:54.750 --> 50:57.833
Oh, shit! He's turned! Oh, shit!

51:04.708 --> 51:06.667
Uh... Clive...

51:08.500 --> 51:11.583
- Help us! For God's sake!
- Help!

51:14.167 --> 51:15.625
Oh, fuck. The hostages.

51:15.625 --> 51:16.708
Quick! Get back in here!

51:16.708 --> 51:18.333
We're tied up, you fucking idiots!

51:18.417 --> 51:21.667
Right, in that case, Tuppence, block
that door. You two, come with me.

51:29.333 --> 51:32.250
- Right! Untie 'em!
- He's turned! Shoot him!

51:32.250 --> 51:34.958
Right, you're with me, sunshine!
Come here!

51:36.917 --> 51:38.000
Sit down!

51:40.833 --> 51:42.083
- Shoot him!
- I did!

51:42.083 --> 51:43.292
Shoot him again then!

51:49.250 --> 51:51.125
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
There's a metal plate in his head!

51:51.125 --> 51:52.208
Well, think of something else!

51:52.208 --> 51:53.542
Grab it! Grab it!

51:57.250 --> 51:58.792
Right, you can have this back, mate!

52:00.792 --> 52:02.000
Go on! Go on!

52:03.125 --> 52:05.333
Sorry, mate. Go on!

52:18.958 --> 52:21.000
- Ter! You all right?
- Yeah.

52:21.500 --> 52:23.750
I am! I blocked the window.
They can't get through.

52:23.750 --> 52:24.667
Great.

52:24.958 --> 52:26.417
Oh, bollocks!

52:26.750 --> 52:28.833
Get back! Put your hands up!

52:29.417 --> 52:30.458
Oh, leave it out, mate.

52:30.458 --> 52:34.375
Shut up! I'm in charge now.
And we're all going to the police.

52:34.375 --> 52:37.667
Don't be stupid.
We've got bigger problems now.

52:37.667 --> 52:40.375
I don't care!
They're all going to prison!

52:40.958 --> 52:42.208
Mate, you might want to turn around.

52:42.208 --> 52:44.167
There's a couple of zombies
creeping up behind ya.

52:44.708 --> 52:48.375
Oh, really? Do you...
honestly think I'm that stupid?

52:48.708 --> 52:51.250
Well... yeah.

52:55.167 --> 52:56.208
Davey!

52:57.583 --> 53:00.042
Please! Get it off me!
I have a heart condition!

53:05.958 --> 53:06.792
Shit!

53:08.292 --> 53:09.875
You're all right, mate.
We'll get you to a hospital.

53:11.917 --> 53:14.083
- This way!
- Clive!

53:17.833 --> 53:18.875
I'm fucked up, admit it.

53:18.875 --> 53:21.667
No, no, don't be daft. You're good as
gold, mate. Good as gold. Good as gold.

53:21.667 --> 53:23.958
Was it... Was it all right
the way we did the robbery?

53:24.750 --> 53:26.583
Yeah, no, yeah, yeah, no, textbook.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.208
At least... At least, it looks that way.

53:30.208 --> 53:33.167
Yeah, mate. As soon as we get all this
sorted, we'll be down at a pub, mate.

53:33.458 --> 53:35.292
We'll be alright, innit?

53:35.708 --> 53:36.583
Davey...

53:39.042 --> 53:39.917
Davey...

53:41.667 --> 53:42.667
I'm sorry, Andy.

53:45.417 --> 53:46.542
He's gone.

53:52.625 --> 53:54.333
We're going to the old folks' home now.

53:54.333 --> 53:56.208
We're gonna save granddad
and his pals, all right?

53:57.792 --> 53:59.208
Sweetheart.

54:01.458 --> 54:03.458
Go on, take it. Go on.

54:05.042 --> 54:08.000
Now, you can either come with us, or we
can drop you off on the way, all right?

54:09.792 --> 54:12.125
Well, my sister's in Marland.
Could you get me there?

54:12.417 --> 54:13.792
All right.

54:14.958 --> 54:16.500
Rest in peace, Tuppence.

54:22.042 --> 54:23.042
Giddy up.

54:32.208 --> 54:33.208
Piss off!

54:36.875 --> 54:39.042
We'll be okay, Ray. We'll make it.

54:39.042 --> 54:42.792
Yeah, no thanks to me. Look at me,
I'm bloody useless. I can't do anything.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.750
Oh, don't, Ray. You've got to see it.
You rescued Hamish.

54:47.750 --> 54:50.333
We wouldn't have been here but for you.

54:50.708 --> 54:54.000
I didn't rescue Hamish. I just got him
stuck in here with the rest of us.

54:54.250 --> 54:56.667
And now we're surrounded on all sides!

54:58.125 --> 54:59.875
If these fucking things get in!...

54:59.875 --> 55:02.042
Then we'll give 'em as good as we get!

55:24.750 --> 55:26.042
I've got the one with the specs.

55:26.583 --> 55:29.000
Hey! No! No! Easy, easy,
take this, take this, all right?

55:38.625 --> 55:41.667
- Get in the car!
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

55:45.417 --> 55:47.375
Mental's got the fucking keys! Shit!

55:47.500 --> 55:48.333
I'll go get 'em.

55:48.333 --> 55:50.542
- No, Andy, you don't need to!
- Andy, don't! It's too dangerous!

55:50.542 --> 55:51.708
I'll be fine!

56:00.542 --> 56:03.250
Hello... Uh... Okay...

56:05.125 --> 56:09.708
Eww... Go away... You queer thing.

56:20.125 --> 56:22.208
- You all right?
- Yeah...

56:55.042 --> 56:56.042
What are you doing here?

56:56.042 --> 56:59.417
Saving your arse as per fucking usual,
mate. D'you think I'm gonna let you die?

56:59.417 --> 57:03.250
Oh, piss off, you muppets! I'll take you
all on and so will my fucking brother!

57:03.250 --> 57:05.292
Fucking stop saying that. Come on.

57:06.333 --> 57:07.792
You better take to save your bullets.

57:08.500 --> 57:10.208
Yeah, but you've already
done a few, mate.

57:10.208 --> 57:12.125
It's not a competition, Andy!

57:13.042 --> 57:15.250
You can't just go running
in there on your own, bruv.

57:15.250 --> 57:16.792
Well, it worked out fine, didn't it?

57:16.917 --> 57:17.958
Yeah, this time, eh?

57:18.042 --> 57:20.042
- Fuck off.
- Fuck off!

57:24.417 --> 57:26.375
Ta-da! We've got the keys.

57:26.375 --> 57:28.375
I don't need keys.

57:28.458 --> 57:30.250
That's why you brought
me along, remember?

57:32.250 --> 57:35.208
Oi! Get off my car! It's a 5 series!

57:43.542 --> 57:46.167
What are we gonna do?
They're gonna break in.

57:46.250 --> 57:47.417
Well, lets get tooled up,

57:47.417 --> 57:50.542
open the doors and take some
of these bastards down with us!

57:50.542 --> 57:52.625
Are you seriously suggesting
that we let 'em all in,

57:52.625 --> 57:57.000
and fight 'em off with a few packs of
corn flakes, and a dodgy egg whisk?

57:57.125 --> 57:59.250
Yeah! And this.

58:00.375 --> 58:03.542
Yeah, but there's only one of them, and
there's a lot of Trafalgars out there!

58:03.958 --> 58:05.958
Eric, Eric, what is a Trafalgar?

58:06.000 --> 58:08.125
Trafalgar is a zombie.
It's rhyming slang innit?

58:08.125 --> 58:09.417
How is it?

58:09.500 --> 58:14.000
Well, Trafalgar Square; fox and hare;
hairy Greek; five-day week;

58:14.000 --> 58:19.042
weak and feeble; pins and needles;
needle and stitch; Abercrombie and Fitch

58:19.167 --> 58:22.083
Abercrombie... Zombie!

58:22.792 --> 58:25.167
- Innit?
- Oh, Lord.

58:26.167 --> 58:27.542
All right, well, how about it?

58:27.542 --> 58:31.125
Why don't we go out there and face them?
Go down fighting? What do you think?

58:31.458 --> 58:35.125
But, somebody might come.
Somebody might rescue us.

58:35.208 --> 58:37.500
Nobody cares. We're on our own.

58:37.542 --> 58:41.167
We're old-age pensioners!
We gotta take care of ourselves!

58:54.125 --> 58:56.125
Looks like we already
sealed off the East End.

58:56.125 --> 58:56.958
We'll be fine.

59:00.125 --> 59:02.708
So, this is how it will end, eh?
The army?

59:04.917 --> 59:09.083
Yeah, 'course they will...
Yeah, maybe.

59:13.042 --> 59:13.875
Maybe.

59:32.583 --> 59:36.042
Wait! Be careful! Shit!

59:42.417 --> 59:45.250
Everyone's been evacuated
to the Hinzman RAF base.

59:45.250 --> 59:46.958
- So if she's alive, she'll be there.
- Right.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.583
- I'll check inside.
- Wait, I'll go with ya.

59:59.792 --> 01:00:01.250
- Going in?
- Yeah.

01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:09.417
Jen.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:14.292
Maybe she got out okay.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.250
Okay.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.625
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:30.667
Jen. Oh, no.

01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:34.500
Look, let me take care of it.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.583
No, no, um, they might find a cure, so...

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:55.333
Well? Did you find her?

01:00:55.333 --> 01:00:58.250
- Uh, no, no, she wasn't, um...
- She, uh, she wasn't there, mate.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:59.292
She wasn't there.

01:01:05.167 --> 01:01:07.250
- Fuck!
- What?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.500
Leprechauns! What do you think?

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:31.833
Can't believe this. Even when they're
zombies, they can't stand each other.

01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:38.542
This is just the
weirdest day of my life.

01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:47.750
Quick.

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:06.375
Hit the road, Ter.

01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:09.208
It's pointless.

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:10.875
If they've already taken over this area,

01:02:10.875 --> 01:02:12.667
they're bound to have gotten
to the old folks' home by now.

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:13.750
You can't give up.

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.208
If we're hunky-dory, so will granddad.

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:16.208
Oh, yeah?!

01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:19.917
And where is that gonna happen exactly,
Andy? Lucky fucking Andy world?!

01:02:19.917 --> 01:02:22.625
Grow up! This place is going to shit!

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.875
Can we just go?

01:02:25.458 --> 01:02:26.292
I can't do this.

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:28.000
Yes, you can. Of course, you can.

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.708
You know, I would've died about ten
times today if it wasn't for you.

01:02:30.708 --> 01:02:33.333
I'm only lucky 'cause you're
always there to sort me out.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.708
We can do this... together.

01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:37.833
Yeah, you... you helped me get to my
sister's house, just like you promised.

01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:40.417
The least I can do is help
you get to your granddad.

01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:43.625
I mean, we haven't even got
any bullets left. How...

01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:47.250
We're gonna pass Mental's
lock-up, don't we?

01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:48.792
Yeah, I guess so.

01:02:48.792 --> 01:02:50.875
His lock-up, where all his guns are.

01:03:08.042 --> 01:03:09.750
What in ...!

01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.125
Fuck me!

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:17.833
Right.

01:03:20.958 --> 01:03:23.667
- Right, Ter, tool up!
- What about this?

01:03:23.917 --> 01:03:26.500
How about something a little
easier to handle, eh, Andy?

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.833
- Fair enough.
- Come on then.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.708
- Put that in.
- Bullets.

01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:40.958
Sick.

01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:43.042
Nice.

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:46.625
Go! Go! Come on!

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.542
Guys... Are you sure we've got enough?

01:03:52.542 --> 01:03:53.792
Yes, come on.

01:03:54.792 --> 01:03:56.333
- Shit!
- What?

01:03:56.417 --> 01:03:59.375
The old folks. We're never gonna
fit 'em all in the car! Shit!

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:01.375
We need another van.

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:08.042
- Katy.
- Yeah.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.542
- Can you hot-wire anything?
- 'Course. Why?

01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:30.250
Fucking hell! Ha ha ha! Yes! Hah! Wooo!

01:04:39.708 --> 01:04:42.792
- Why have we stopped?
- There's a red light.

01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:45.000
There's no other fucking
traffic, you plum.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:45.958
Just drive!

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:48.583
Just be a rebel for once in
your life, Terrence, please.

01:04:48.917 --> 01:04:52.292
Well, for fuck's sake!
Excuse me for obeying highway code!

01:04:56.042 --> 01:04:58.583
Get off our bus, you fucking mug!

01:05:03.042 --> 01:05:04.542
No ticket.

01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:11.583
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:12.750
Yep, all right.

01:05:36.125 --> 01:05:37.333
Look, they might be alright.

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:40.083
They probably locked themselves
in the basement or sumthink.

01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:41.542
I don't think there is a basement, mate.

01:05:41.875 --> 01:05:43.000
We need to make a diversion.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.042
Well, leave that to me.

01:05:44.042 --> 01:05:45.750
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Okay.

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.667
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- There's loads... There's loads...

01:05:49.125 --> 01:05:51.958
Now, take this, if we're
longer than ten minutes...

01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:54.000
- Then fucking wait longer.
- Will do.

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:59.917
Hey, guys! Come here, you big losers!

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:02.750
Woo-oo! Come on!

01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:05.792
Go, go, go, go!

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:10.917
Let's go!

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.542
Come on! Over here!

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:53.833
There are too many of 'em.
Ain't there a safer way in?

01:06:55.333 --> 01:06:56.250
Skylight.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.833
- Yeah, go, go, go!
- Okay.

01:07:06.083 --> 01:07:08.792
- I'll do it.
- Right, work your magic, girl.

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:10.375
- You see out?
- No.

01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:18.458
- Think you got twisted, luv.
- Yeah, fuck off.

01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:20.958
Done.

01:07:23.083 --> 01:07:24.250
Careful.

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:28.625
Go fuck yourselves, you zombie bastards!

01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:30.208
Jesus Christ!

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.875
Terry, what are you doing here?

01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:37.125
We came to to save you, then you try
and use my face as a chopping board.

01:07:37.125 --> 01:07:39.708
Well, I thought you was a
fucking zombie, didn't I?

01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:42.667
Hello, sweetheart. Well, they
dragged you along with them too?

01:07:42.667 --> 01:07:43.500
I volunteered.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.083
Yeah, all right. Let's get reacquainted
later. We need all of youse...

01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:48.667
to climb up here so we can go down
the fire escape. All right, let's go.

01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:50.500
You're having a
"tin bath" (laugh), aintcha?

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.333
Eric is a "Raspberry Ripple" (cripple),
Darryl's got his bad leg,

01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:56.542
and Hamish is on his
third hip replacement.

01:07:56.583 --> 01:08:00.208
Okay, is there anyone down there
that has not had a hip replacement?

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.583
I ain't. Now come down here,
and we'll talk about it.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:09.333
All right.

01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:15.583
- Oh, Andy! Andy!
- All right, Doreen?

01:08:17.167 --> 01:08:18.832
All right, all right.
Where do we go from here?

01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:20.000
- Out the front door.
- Yep.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.332
Oh, fuck's sake, we've
been saved, everyone.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.625
Laurel and fucking Hardy
here's come to rescue us.

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:30.582
You haven't seen out in the lawn yet.
There's hundreds of zombies out there.

01:08:30.582 --> 01:08:32.250
Well, outside we've got
a double-decker bus.

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:34.332
so if we can all get there,
we're laughing, all right?

01:08:34.332 --> 01:08:37.042
Yeah, well, we got a knife,
we got a few forks,

01:08:37.042 --> 01:08:39.332
and a fucking Alligator
Lopper over there.

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:41.082
And... we got this.

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:48.125
Boys, boys, now you're
talking my language.

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.417
Right, who wants this?

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:53.542
Uzi 9 millimetre.

01:08:54.957 --> 01:08:58.500
Remember, finger off the trigger,
till you're ready to shoot.

01:08:58.957 --> 01:09:00.917
- Thank you, thank you very much.
- No problem.

01:09:04.542 --> 01:09:06.292
Peggy, would you fancy something
like this? I mean, is it...

01:09:14.332 --> 01:09:15.207
Wow!

01:09:15.207 --> 01:09:17.250
All right, so you know
what to do with this, yeah?

01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:18.167
Of course I do.

01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:23.292
- Sorry.
- Just be fucking careful, will ya?

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.207
- Eric!
- Sorry.

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:33.292
And voila, I call her "The Bitch".

01:09:35.957 --> 01:09:37.375
- You ready?
- Yep.

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:39.750
Let's do this.

01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:45.167
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:10:13.583 --> 01:10:15.042
You gotta shoot them in the head.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.458
- We know where to fucking shoot 'em!
- All right.

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:33.042
That was it?!

01:10:41.375 --> 01:10:44.833
Oh, well d... Marvellous!

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:58.750
Darryl, where're you going?
What're you doing? Come on.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.250
Ey! Ey, look!

01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:11.250
Wrong leg, silly bullet.

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:21.208
Bastard! Had enough, have ya?

01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:23.500
Yeah, well, I think he's dead. Come on.

01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:26.625
- Could I put me leg on?
- All right.

01:11:32.083 --> 01:11:33.583
Hello, Natasha.

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:47.542
Sorry, lover.
I don't really fancy you anymore.

01:11:55.208 --> 01:11:57.042
- That was really sad.
- Yeah.

01:12:16.625 --> 01:12:20.667
Push me, somebody.
This bastard is mine.

01:12:20.708 --> 01:12:23.000
I've got your back, bro!

01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:27.417
Eat lead, zombie!

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:32.458
Come on.

01:12:38.417 --> 01:12:41.083
"Gordon Bennett" (gorblimey)!
There's tons of the bastards.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.292
- Yes! Yes!
- I'm coming!

01:12:53.292 --> 01:12:54.333
Now, you're gonna get it!

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Come and get the door, boy.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.958
Your time has come, mister. Yeah!

01:13:10.833 --> 01:13:12.375
Come on, Doreen. Get in.

01:13:14.792 --> 01:13:16.625
God! They are just... unbelievable!

01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:18.417
Here you go, Hamish.

01:13:20.917 --> 01:13:23.333
Go! Go! Go! Get in the bus!
Get in the bus!

01:13:31.917 --> 01:13:35.292
Andy, do we need all these bags?
What, are these guns too?

01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:40.167
Hello. Are you a friend of the boys?

01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:44.333
Oh, um, I'm Emma. Um, no, I just met the
boys at the robbery this morning, so...

01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:46.250
Robbery?

01:13:47.792 --> 01:13:52.667
Funny story, actually. Um, we found out
that the care home is closing down,

01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:54.750
and, you know, we...
we didn't want you to go up north...

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:55.875
And?

01:13:57.125 --> 01:13:59.292
Well, we wanted to look after you so...

01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:04.958
we sort of, uhm... robbed the bank.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.250
You robbed the bank?!

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:18.792
After all I've tried to teach
you about working for a living?

01:14:19.583 --> 01:14:22.583
After what happened to your mum
and dad, God rest their souls?

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:27.958
How much did you get?

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:30.542
Two and a half million.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.542
Well, that was really stupid.

01:14:34.542 --> 01:14:35.833
Two and a half million.

01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:41.042
It was irresponsible and wrong. But you
definitely got the Maguire genes in you.

01:14:43.208 --> 01:14:44.625
You're not angry?

01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:48.000
Look, you risked prison to make sure
me and this lot were taken care of.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.333
You risked your lives
to come and save us.

01:14:53.292 --> 01:14:54.958
I'm impressed.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.125
Cheers.

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:58.250
But if you ever do it again,

01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:00.708
I shall knock seven shades
of shit out of the pair of ya!

01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:02.042
We won't, granddad.

01:15:02.042 --> 01:15:04.500
And don't fucking call me granddad!

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:08.708
Terry, come on! Get your toe down!
Let's get out of here!

01:15:32.667 --> 01:15:35.333
Fuck! I broke the gearbox.

01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:38.208
Jesus Christ! I take it back!
You're a pair of idiots!

01:15:38.917 --> 01:15:41.583
We're near the river.
Maybe you can find a boat.

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:43.333
Good idea! Let's get to the docks.

01:15:58.083 --> 01:15:59.458
Go! Go! Go!

01:16:03.208 --> 01:16:04.458
You can't have some at all!

01:16:13.333 --> 01:16:16.125
- Come on, Hamish!
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:24.083
Doing well... Doing brilliant...

01:16:26.958 --> 01:16:28.500
Keep up!

01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:31.167
Go! Get on the boat!

01:16:33.042 --> 01:16:34.625
Hamish, come on, mate, hurry!

01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:41.542
Not much further.

01:16:43.125 --> 01:16:44.667
Fucking die!

01:16:45.458 --> 01:16:46.542
Come on, Hamish!

01:16:46.542 --> 01:16:47.875
Just got to get over there, okay?

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:03.875
- Get the boat started!
- Take the bag!

01:17:05.958 --> 01:17:07.375
Hamish, you're nearly there, bruv!

01:17:07.375 --> 01:17:08.625
Where's the key?

01:17:08.667 --> 01:17:12.042
Come on, Hamish, sprint!
Stay!... Down!

01:17:14.708 --> 01:17:15.667
Come on, Hammy.

01:17:16.292 --> 01:17:18.500
- You all right, guys?
- Yes, come on!

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:20.750
Get on the boat! Get on the boat!

01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:25.458
Oh, there it is!

01:17:44.042 --> 01:17:47.167
We can't go! We're still chained!

01:17:49.042 --> 01:17:49.792
Fuck.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:55.208
Oh, fucking hell! You want summink
done, do it your fucking self!

01:17:57.458 --> 01:18:00.333
Youse two! Look after Katy... and Peggy!

01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:03.625
And get a fucking job, or I'll
come back and fucking haunt ya!

01:18:03.708 --> 01:18:05.625
- What're you doing?!
- Granddad!

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:09.750
- Granddad!
- Go, granddad!

01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:18.167
- Granddad!
- Granddad!

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:23.125
Go away! Fuck off!

01:18:30.667 --> 01:18:33.458
- Fuck off! Fuck off!
- Don't fucking shoot him!

01:18:35.542 --> 01:18:38.708
You're free! You're free! You're free!

01:18:56.083 --> 01:18:58.167
Right.

01:18:58.375 --> 01:18:59.875
- Andy!
- Andy!

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.625
Oi! I'll take the fucking lot of ya!

01:19:02.625 --> 01:19:04.125
And so will his brother!

01:19:04.125 --> 01:19:05.417
And so will their cousin!

01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:07.208
This is for our granddad, you shits!

01:19:27.292 --> 01:19:28.625
Come on!

01:19:31.417 --> 01:19:33.500
I told you not to call me granddad!

01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:34.917
Come on!

01:19:46.083 --> 01:19:48.000
- Katy, I'm out!
- Here!

01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:01.375
Katy!

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.167
Oh, for fuck's sake! Not you again?

01:21:06.625 --> 01:21:07.667
Oh, Ray!

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:10.708
Oh, that's disgusting.

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:16.500
All right, granddad.
All right, that'll do.

01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:21.000
- Oh, Andy. Oh, my baby. Oh...
- Oh, cheers. Cheers, Doreen, yeah.

01:21:28.667 --> 01:21:30.833
Do you think they will sort this out?

01:21:33.208 --> 01:21:36.625
They can't just leave it. I mean, we
grew up here. It's part of our history.

01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:39.250
East End's been through far worse, Katy.

01:21:39.625 --> 01:21:41.833
It'll bounce back. Always has.

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:43.875
You know why? 'Cause we're strong.

01:21:43.917 --> 01:21:48.667
Well said! And if it comes to it,
I shall round up every nutter,

01:21:48.708 --> 01:21:51.125
from Bermondsey to Canning Town,

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:55.542
and we'll fucking sort this out,
the way we have done for centuries,

01:21:55.625 --> 01:21:56.958
through the ages.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.083
We will look them in the eye.
We'll face them square on.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:04.000
We'll fight them, and we'll win.
We shall prevail!

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.667
Hurray! Yeah!

01:22:06.542 --> 01:22:08.333
Oi! Zombies!

01:22:08.833 --> 01:22:11.667
Get the fuck out of my East End!
