        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:06.100 --> 00:07.300
             CLIFF:             
        Oh-- here's Sam.        

00:07.300 --> 00:08.700
CARLA: Oh, come on, Sammy.      
                    Hey, Sammy. 

00:08.800 --> 00:10.600
        Sammy, open up.         
         It's freezing!         

00:10.600 --> 00:11.600
              SAM:              
Hey, what are you guys standing 
          around for?           

00:11.700 --> 00:12.600
    How come somebody           
    didn't let you in?          

00:12.700 --> 00:13.800
             CARLA:             
      I left my keys home.      

00:13.900 --> 00:15.600
SAM:                            
Oh, no, I was                   
counting on yours.              

00:15.700 --> 00:16.900
                        REBECCA:
                     I left mine
                  in the office.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.000
            Hurry up! It's cold!

00:18.100 --> 00:20.100
         Well, how are          
     we gonna get in here?      

00:20.100 --> 00:21.700
NORM:                           
'Morning, everybody.            
                  OTHERS: Norm! 

00:21.700 --> 00:24.400
        (keys jangling)         
NORM:                           
Sorry I'm late.                 

00:28.400 --> 00:30.900
      (theme song begins)       

00:33.600 --> 00:35.800
    ¶ Making your way           
      in the world today ¶      

00:35.900 --> 00:38.900
¶ Takes everything you've got ¶

00:44.700 --> 00:48.300
      ¶ Wouldn't you like       
         to get away? ¶         

00:50.900 --> 00:53.300
  ¶ Sometimes you want to go

01:40.700 --> 01:43.100
                    (grunts)    

01:43.100 --> 01:44.500
      Sorry I took so long      
getting here this morning.      

01:44.600 --> 01:46.400
          Sam, you know, this is
    the fourth time this week   

01:46.600 --> 01:47.900
          that you've been late.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.700
  As a responsible businessman  
and the owner of this bar,      

01:50.800 --> 01:52.100
     you owe it to yourself     
            to stick            

01:52.100 --> 01:53.800
to a more responsible schedule, 
        you know.               

01:53.900 --> 01:55.100
Absolutely.                     

01:55.100 --> 01:57.700
If the post office ran          
its business the way            
you run yours...                

01:57.800 --> 01:59.400
        Never mind.             

02:01.700 --> 02:03.200
I have a good excuse this time. 

02:03.300 --> 02:05.300
    I'm being treated           
      by a dermatologist.       

02:05.500 --> 02:06.700
    Is it anything serious?     

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
         No, no, no...          
        I just told her         

02:07.900 --> 02:09.800
that I had a patch of dry skin, 

02:09.900 --> 02:11.600
and we stayed up all night      
        looking for it.         

02:14.400 --> 02:16.300
Found it, too--                 
four times, by golly.           

02:16.300 --> 02:19.900
         Sammy, uh, can we stick
to the topic at hand, please?   

02:20.000 --> 02:21.200
Yeah, Sam. I don't mean to make 
    any threats here,           

02:21.300 --> 02:22.700
  but Gary's Old Towne Tavern   
         already opens          

02:22.800 --> 02:24.700
a half-hour before you do.      

02:24.800 --> 02:26.100
 And how do we know that, Norm? 

02:26.200 --> 02:29.000
                Hey, who's on   
                trial here, huh?

02:29.100 --> 02:30.100
        Hey, everybody.         

02:30.200 --> 02:31.200
         Hey, Woody...          

02:31.300 --> 02:32.700
         You won't believe this.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.400
        I just found out        
    that on cable TV,           

02:35.500 --> 02:37.400
     they have this channel     
where they show you stuff       

02:37.400 --> 02:42.200
  and you can buy it any hour   
of the day, any day of the week.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.900
    How did we live before?     

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
          Yeah, yeah.           
    Home Shopping Channel--     

02:47.100 --> 02:48.600
          Ma loves it,          
she's always watching it.       

02:48.700 --> 02:50.900
 She's always saying, "If I had 
 a rich son, he'd buy me this,  

02:51.000 --> 02:52.600
      If I had a rich son,      
    he'd buy me that."          

02:52.700 --> 02:55.100
  Who do you think bought her   
the TV in the first place?      

02:55.100 --> 02:55.800
         You, Cliffie?          

02:55.900 --> 02:57.400
No, but if I find the guy,      

02:57.500 --> 02:59.300
  I'm gonna shove that clicker  
        down his throat.        

03:01.100 --> 03:03.100
Look at this--                  
I already got my first package. 

03:03.200 --> 03:04.400
             Yeah?              

03:04.500 --> 03:06.300
         Huh?                   

03:06.400 --> 03:08.500
It's a toy car...               

03:08.600 --> 03:13.700
and also rewinds videotapes.    

03:13.800 --> 03:16.300
    Now, uh, wouldn't a VCR     
         rewind tapes?          

03:16.400 --> 03:19.200
    Uh, not the one I bought    
          last night.           

03:19.300 --> 03:20.600
REBECCA:                        
Excuse me,                      

03:20.600 --> 03:22.300
                          Carla.

03:22.300 --> 03:23.900
Did you read my last memo?      

03:23.900 --> 03:25.400
              No.               

03:25.600 --> 03:26.800
Well, if you had read it,       
         you would know         

03:26.800 --> 03:29.100
that we are no longer accepting 
 time cards made out in pencil. 

03:29.100 --> 03:30.600
                    From now on,

03:30.800 --> 03:32.200
all paperwork must be done      
            in ink.             

03:32.300 --> 03:33.600
                        Okay.   

03:33.600 --> 03:35.300
Did you hear me?                

03:35.400 --> 03:37.600
Are you acknowledging my memo?  

03:37.700 --> 03:39.900
                I heard you!    
                I acknowledge   
                  the damn memo!

03:40.000 --> 03:42.500
Now would you get out of my face
so I can finish this time card? 

03:42.500 --> 03:43.900
    I mean, this isn't easy,    
        you know.               

03:44.000 --> 03:46.300
          My pencil's           
    almost down to the nub.     

03:48.200 --> 03:51.100
 Well, as long as you're aware  
        of the problem.         

03:52.700 --> 03:55.200
Oy... that's something,         
eh, Norm?                       

03:55.300 --> 03:56.800
Remember the good old days?     

03:56.800 --> 03:59.100
When you used to be able to take
an argument like that           

03:59.200 --> 04:02.500
between two gals and turn them  
into the Jets and the Sharks?   

04:03.700 --> 04:05.100
         Tell you what, Cliffie,

04:05.200 --> 04:09.500
              for you, I'm gonna
        tee it up one more time.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.800
All right.                      
                     Watch this.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.700
                    Rebecca, uh,

04:15.700 --> 04:18.500
                  I noticed your
            little exchange with
            Carla over there,   

04:18.600 --> 04:21.300
and I have to say, I admire     
your management technique.      

04:21.399 --> 04:22.900
                  Thank you very
                     much, Norm.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.800
It takes a lot of courage,      
you know, to humiliate yourself 

04:25.900 --> 04:28.400
just for the well-being         
of one employee.                

04:28.500 --> 04:29.900
If you were a Japanese          
businessman,                    

04:29.900 --> 04:32.700
I mean, to lose face like that, 
you'd probably have to          

04:32.700 --> 04:34.700
commit some sort                
of ritual suicide, you know?    

04:34.700 --> 04:36.000
But here in America...          

04:36.100 --> 04:37.300
                Carla!          

04:37.500 --> 04:38.700
    Come in my office,          

04:38.800 --> 04:40.800
      bring that time card      
        and a <i>pen.</i>              

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
                I'd better be   
                getting a raise.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
         (door closing)         

04:46.200 --> 04:48.400
CLIFF:                          
Oh,                             

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
the master returns              
from his triumphal march        

04:50.500 --> 04:53.200
to the valley of evil.          

04:54.100 --> 04:55.800
         I got a raise.         

04:57.000 --> 04:59.700
Frasier, darling,               
today is                        

04:59.800 --> 05:01.600
our monthly luncheon            
with the Psychoanalytic         

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
and Social Therapeutic          
Practitioners Society.          

05:03.700 --> 05:05.000
Have you forgotten?             

05:05.000 --> 05:07.200
        Well, let me finish this
            double, and I might.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.500
Now, Doctor...                  

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
             Yeah, well, Lilith,
            I really can't stand

05:11.500 --> 05:13.700
                    another dry,
                endless luncheon

05:13.700 --> 05:15.600
                  in some stuffy
                 old restaurant.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.000
                  Pretty boring,
                      huh, Fras?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.100
                Well, let me put
            it this way, Sam.   

05:19.200 --> 05:20.500
                Lilith is the   
                  Dorothy Parker

05:20.500 --> 05:22.000
              of this particular
                     roundtable.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.500
Come on, Frasier,               
let's go.                       

05:23.600 --> 05:26.000
                All right, but I
                 won't enjoy it.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.500
Hey, Norm, go ahead,            
make them fight.                

05:27.600 --> 05:28.900
                      Oh, you do
                    it, come on.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.300
        Me?                     
                    Yeah.       

05:30.400 --> 05:32.100
                          CLIFF:
                  Hey, Fras, you
        think Carla should be   

05:32.200 --> 05:34.400
filling out the time card       
with a pen or a pencil?         

05:34.400 --> 05:36.500
    I can see                   

05:36.600 --> 05:38.800
why you can't tear yourself     
away from this place.           

05:39.800 --> 05:41.700
All right, all right,           
all right.                      

05:41.800 --> 05:43.300
So I'm not you.                 

05:43.400 --> 05:44.500
        Cliffie, come on now.   

05:44.600 --> 05:45.700
                 Buck up, buddy.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.000
             You're, you're just
                warming up here.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.000
    You got to start out with   
         an easy one first, huh?

05:50.100 --> 05:51.500
    Yeah.                       
                Look, there's...
                there's Paul!   

05:51.600 --> 05:52.200
There's Paul.                   
                 Hey, Hey, Paul!

05:52.200 --> 05:54.500
    Shut up, fathead!           

06:00.900 --> 06:02.300
        Hey, guys.              

06:02.400 --> 06:03.800
                      Hey, Wood.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.300
      Look what I just got      
    on the shopping channel.    

06:08.800 --> 06:11.400
                    Now, there's
                only about 2,000

06:11.400 --> 06:14.000
                 of these little
              babies left, so...

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
             a word to the wise.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.600
                    Well?       

06:22.700 --> 06:24.500
Well, that's, uh...             

06:24.500 --> 06:26.900
It's beautiful, Woody.          

06:27.000 --> 06:28.700
It's a beautiful cow.           

06:28.700 --> 06:30.500
                    Yeah.       

06:30.600 --> 06:33.100
        I'll say, and that's not
            the best part of it.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.800
        It's also a great clock.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.000
            (click)             

06:36.000 --> 06:37.200
          MALE VOICE:           
            It's...             

06:37.300 --> 06:38.900
    (imitating cow bellow):     
         <i>...noon.</i>               

06:43.500 --> 06:45.400
                     What, um...

06:45.500 --> 06:47.400
                 What happens if
              it's 7:00 o'clock?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.400
                    Well,       

06:49.500 --> 06:52.300
     a cow's power of speech are
      kind of limited, you know.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.500
              Everything kind of
                  sounds like...

06:54.600 --> 06:57.600
                (imitates cow   
                    bellowing): 
                     <i>...noon.</i>   

06:57.800 --> 06:59.800
            How do you ever know
                what time it is?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.700
            Well, it helps if   
            you wear a watch.   

07:08.800 --> 07:10.800
I think it's, um...             

07:10.900 --> 07:12.600
I think it's nice, Woody.       

07:12.700 --> 07:13.800
                         Really?

07:13.900 --> 07:16.000
Yeah.                           

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
                     It's yours.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.600
Oh, no, Woody.                  

07:20.700 --> 07:21.900
I-I-I... I real...              
I couldn't.                     

07:22.000 --> 07:23.200
                      Miss Howe,

07:23.200 --> 07:24.600
                    I've been to
                 your apartment.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.000
                Take the cow.   

07:27.800 --> 07:30.400
        I know you fellows favor
    a more formal atmosphere,   

07:30.400 --> 07:32.200
                    but allow me
                    to charm you

07:32.200 --> 07:34.000
                 with the quaint
                  hospitality of

07:34.100 --> 07:35.700
my friendly                     
neighborhood tavern.            

07:35.800 --> 07:36.700
      Excuse me, Frasier.       

07:36.800 --> 07:38.000
    I have to go check          
          my messages.          

07:38.100 --> 07:40.400
You got one                     
from Madame Tussauds.           

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
    "Get back                   
    to the museum."             

07:45.000 --> 07:46.300
  Champagne for everyone, Sam.  

07:46.400 --> 07:47.700
              Oh!               

07:47.700 --> 07:49.500
I'm trying to convince          
my esteemed colleagues          

07:49.600 --> 07:52.900
to move their monthly meetings  
to your fine establishment.     

07:53.000 --> 07:54.200
                Oh, hey, thanks.
                That's great.   

07:54.300 --> 07:57.200
Uh, my, uh, gold card           

07:57.300 --> 07:59.500
should keep the, uh...          
the bubbly flowing.             

07:59.600 --> 08:01.600
(laughs)                        

08:01.700 --> 08:04.000
                        NORM:   
             Cliffie, the master
                  has a thought.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.400
                          CLIFF:
                            Yes?

08:05.500 --> 08:08.100
        One might wonder what   
            would happen if, uh,

08:08.200 --> 08:10.200
             we called a certain
             credit card company

08:10.300 --> 08:12.300
            and reported that   
            number as stolen.   

08:12.400 --> 08:15.600
             Then when a certain
                 bartender tried

08:15.700 --> 08:17.500
        to put it through for   
             a certain customer,

08:17.600 --> 08:19.500
          and it wasn't honored,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.200
             what do you suppose
                would happen?   

08:21.300 --> 08:22.300
I don't know.                   

08:22.400 --> 08:23.600
                Major fireworks.

08:23.700 --> 08:24.900
        Oh!                     

08:24.900 --> 08:26.300
You're a genius!                

08:26.300 --> 08:28.200
Why do you put up with me?      

08:28.300 --> 08:30.200
                I don't know.   

08:31.600 --> 08:33.900
Frasier, I have to leave.       

08:34.000 --> 08:35.700
There's been an emergency.      

08:35.799 --> 08:36.900
        Is it Frederick?        
                         No, no.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.600
    Otto, my lab assistant,     

08:38.700 --> 08:40.900
             has gotten into the
    synthetic hormones again.   

08:41.000 --> 08:42.700
                    I have to   
                bail him out.   

08:42.700 --> 08:46.300
            Or her. I won't know
              until I get there.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.600
            Oh, no!             

08:49.700 --> 08:52.300
        Miss Howe,              
look what I found in the trash! 

08:52.400 --> 08:54.100
         It's your cow!         

08:54.200 --> 08:56.500
Oh, dear, how could that        
have gotten in there?           

08:56.600 --> 08:58.000
                            Sam?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
                  You told me to
            throw it away....   

09:01.800 --> 09:04.400
                         So, the
                paranoid says...

09:04.400 --> 09:05.600
        (laughing)              

09:05.700 --> 09:06.900
          "Help! Help!          

09:07.000 --> 09:09.100
  They're all out to get me!"   

09:09.200 --> 09:12.400
                      (laughing)

09:16.400 --> 09:18.700
     I guess you had to be      
        in the session.         

09:19.700 --> 09:22.200
          Dr. Crane, can I speak
            to you for a minute?

09:22.300 --> 09:24.000
             Oh, of course, Sam.
                            SAM:
                    Got a little

09:24.100 --> 09:25.600
        problem here-- I, uh,   
          called to get approval

09:25.700 --> 09:28.300
on your credit card here, and   
     they told me it was stolen.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.800
Well that's utterly             
ludicrous, Sam.                 

09:29.900 --> 09:31.200
              Well, yeah, that's
            what I told them,   

09:31.300 --> 09:33.000
          but they-they insisted
              that it is stolen.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.400
Yes, I-I knocked myself         
over the head                   

09:34.500 --> 09:35.900
and stole my own credit card.   

09:35.900 --> 09:37.800
That's brilliant, Sam.          
Who would ever suspect me?      

09:37.800 --> 09:39.200
SAM:                            
I'm not kidding here.           

09:39.300 --> 09:41.200
          You know, they're very
      serious about their rules.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.700
             They told me that I
            have to cut this up.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.400
You wouldn't, Sam!              

09:45.600 --> 09:46.700
            I don't want to, no!

09:46.800 --> 09:48.500
              Tell you what. Um,

09:48.500 --> 09:50.200
                why don't I, uh,
                 run a tab, huh?

09:50.300 --> 09:51.700
Well, I don't need a tab.       

09:51.800 --> 09:53.100
It's a perfectly good card!     

09:53.200 --> 09:54.200
                 Well, why don't
                  I just, uh...?

09:54.200 --> 09:55.500
                  This is on the
            house, all right?   

09:55.600 --> 09:57.500
Oh, fine! Now you're adding     
insult to injury!               

09:57.600 --> 09:58.900
Well, I don't take charity!     

09:59.000 --> 10:00.200
Just give me back               
my card!                        

10:00.300 --> 10:02.000
        I can't give you back   
              the card, Frasier.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.700
        I've got to cut it up   
             and send the pieces
            back to the company.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.400
(scoffs)                        
You do not have to do that.     

10:06.400 --> 10:07.400
                      Yes, I do!

10:07.500 --> 10:09.000
                    They spent a
                    half an hour

10:09.100 --> 10:11.700
        on just that fact at the
        seminar at the Sheraton.

10:12.900 --> 10:16.000
Sam, I am telling you,          
you do not have to do that!     

10:16.100 --> 10:17.100
                  You weren't at
                    the seminar.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.900
             If I don't do this,
              they're gonna take

10:19.100 --> 10:20.200
                  my little card
                    thingy away.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.700
Sam, I am not asking you.       

10:21.700 --> 10:23.800
I'm telling you!                
Give me back my card!           

10:23.800 --> 10:25.500
            Don't take that tone
            of voice with me!   

10:25.600 --> 10:27.400
Frasier, can I help?            
I have a card that works.       

10:27.500 --> 10:29.900
                 Oh shut up, you
              Skinnerian baboon!

10:29.900 --> 10:32.700
Sam, do not touch               
those scissors to that card!    

10:32.800 --> 10:33.900
        I got to do it, Frasier.

10:33.900 --> 10:34.600
You do not!                     
                    Yes, I...   

10:34.700 --> 10:36.400
(choking grunt)                 

10:40.300 --> 10:42.200
                      I'm sorry.
                      I'm sorry.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.600
              I t-tell you what.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.200
                 Here, take-take
                my credit cards.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.500
        Oh, fine!               

10:46.600 --> 10:48.500
With your $90 credit limit,     

10:48.600 --> 10:50.500
I can go hog-wild               
at Monkey Ward's!               

10:52.500 --> 10:54.300
You have made me look the fool. 

10:54.400 --> 10:57.100
            Yeah, I think you've
          taken care of that all
        by yourself, Frasier!   

10:57.200 --> 10:59.400
Oh. So it's come                
to this, has it?                

10:59.500 --> 11:01.100
After years of friendship,      

11:01.200 --> 11:03.800
you proudly pour a tall cup     
of humiliation.                 

11:03.900 --> 11:05.500
Well, I've had enough,          
thank you.                      

11:05.500 --> 11:06.600
This is good-bye.               

11:06.700 --> 11:09.200
You have seen and heard         
the last of Frasier Crane.      

11:09.300 --> 11:10.500
From this moment forward,       

11:10.600 --> 11:13.000
    I am never stepping foot    
    in this bar again!          

11:13.000 --> 11:15.900
I close the iron door upon you! 

11:17.900 --> 11:20.400
What do we do now,              
oh master?                      

11:20.500 --> 11:23.100
                Shut up and stop
              calling me master.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.300
Anyone hear from Frasier        
since yesterday?                

11:34.400 --> 11:35.900
                  He'll be back,
        don't worry about it.   

11:36.000 --> 11:38.100
         I don't know,          
he left here pretty angry.      

11:38.200 --> 11:39.500
            I mean,             
I keep calling the house,       

11:39.600 --> 11:41.700
        and the machine         
    keeps picking up.           

11:41.800 --> 11:42.900
      Oh, Lilith answers?       

11:44.300 --> 11:45.200
         He's blowing off steam.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.500
            He'll be back.      

11:46.600 --> 11:47.900
    Oh, I hope so.              

11:48.000 --> 11:49.400
Well... (clears throat)         

11:49.500 --> 11:52.700
I guess we really               
messed up, huh?                 

11:52.800 --> 11:54.100
                  We learned our
                  lesson, Cliff.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.400
    We've got to stop messing   
            with people's minds.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.800
    Yeah, I agree.              

11:57.800 --> 11:59.700
                By the way, your
              fly's open, buddy.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.200
Yeah, so's yours.               

12:01.200 --> 12:04.100
        (both laughing)         

12:04.100 --> 12:06.800
    You can't expect a guy to   
    go cold turkey, you know.   

12:06.900 --> 12:08.900
        (laughing)              

12:09.000 --> 12:10.700
                    You checked,
              didn't you, Cliff?

12:10.800 --> 12:12.200
Oh, yeah, like                  
you weren't looking             

12:12.200 --> 12:14.700
through the bottom              
of that beer mug.               

12:15.900 --> 12:17.600
        Miss Howe?              

12:18.900 --> 12:20.300
Last night the shopping channel 

12:20.400 --> 12:23.800
    was a consumer bonanza,     
  and I took advantage of it.   

12:23.800 --> 12:26.000
    Their loss is your gain.    

12:26.000 --> 12:29.900
First, I got you a genuine      
    gold-look bracelet          

12:30.000 --> 12:32.500
    with 200 real sapphires.    

12:32.500 --> 12:33.900
    Oh, Woody.                  

12:34.000 --> 12:35.700
First of all, you have          
to stop buying me gifts.        

12:35.800 --> 12:37.000
And second of all,              

12:37.100 --> 12:39.700
you have to learn               
that sapphires are blue.        

12:39.800 --> 12:43.600
         Okay, but you can't say
      "no" to a new and improved

12:43.600 --> 12:49.400
      snackmaster <i>and</i> a portable
        solar-powered telephone.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.600
Woody, I cannot accept these.   

12:51.600 --> 12:53.600
People are going to get         
the wrong idea.                 

12:53.700 --> 12:55.700
            What, that I have   
                 a crush on you?

12:55.800 --> 12:58.400
No, that I like crap.           

13:03.000 --> 13:05.900
                  You're calling
              this stuff "crap"?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.500
I'm sorry, Woody.               

13:07.600 --> 13:09.900
        No, no, I was looking   
             for the right word.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Well, if you don't              
like it either,                 

13:12.100 --> 13:14.100
why do you keep                 
buying this stuff?              

13:14.200 --> 13:16.700
                    Not "stuff,"
             Miss Howe-- "crap."

13:19.000 --> 13:20.800
        I buy it because        
      it looks good on TV.      

13:20.800 --> 13:24.800
     The second they flash      
 that 800 number, I'm dialing.  

13:24.900 --> 13:26.700
Woody, this-this                
has got to stop.                

13:26.800 --> 13:28.700
                 Well, it-it has
             stopped, Miss Howe.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.000
        I went over my credit   
        limit with this... crap.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.900
              Unless, of course,
        you'd care to advance me

13:36.000 --> 13:37.300
      six months on my paycheck.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.100
                Could be another
         necklace in it for you.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.300
            An-And if you decide

13:42.300 --> 13:43.800
     not to give me the advance,

13:43.900 --> 13:46.900
          just keep the necklace
              as your free gift.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.000
Woody, you are hooked.          

13:51.200 --> 13:52.600
Listen to me,                   
you need help.                  

13:52.700 --> 13:55.600
            I don't need help, I
          just need more credit.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.200
        You're right, Miss Howe,
                 I do need help.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.900
                    I'm scared. 

14:05.000 --> 14:07.800
                    Help me.    

14:07.800 --> 14:09.500
                Hurry.          

14:09.500 --> 14:11.700
                Act now.        

14:18.200 --> 14:20.100
             Well, I just got in
             touch with Frasier.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.700
             NORM:              
    Oh, yeah, what'd he say?    

14:21.700 --> 14:24.500
Well, he said that he considers 
these phone calls a harassment. 

14:24.600 --> 14:27.000
If I don't cease and desist,    
he's gonna get a court order    

14:27.100 --> 14:31.500
restraining me from coming      
within 50 feet of him.          

14:31.500 --> 14:32.900
Restraining order--             

14:33.000 --> 14:37.600
the last resort of shrinks      
and housewives in nightgowns.   

14:42.000 --> 14:43.500
            Come on, Cliffie.   

14:43.600 --> 14:45.800
        We've gotta stop this   
     before it gets any further.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.600
  We've got to go to Frasier,   
tell him exactly what happened. 

14:48.600 --> 14:50.700
    Accept all blame,           
and the sooner the better.      

14:50.800 --> 14:52.200
Yeah, you're right.             

14:52.300 --> 14:53.900
Wait a minute,                  
wait a minute.                  
                          What? 

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I just thought                  
of something.                   
                    What's that?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.400
If we wait like a couple of     
hours, it'll be dinnertime.     

14:58.500 --> 15:00.600
Might be able to snag           
a free meal.                    

15:00.700 --> 15:04.200
             You are the master,
                       <i>oh salam.</i>

15:10.400 --> 15:12.500
            Now, this is lovely.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.000
      The baby's with my mother,

15:14.100 --> 15:16.900
          and there's nothing to
      disturb our peaceful Eden.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.000
You're right,                   
darling, nothing.               

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
 Except for the burned-in image 
             of Sam             

15:21.000 --> 15:26.300
cutting my gold card into pieces
      before my very eyes.      

15:26.300 --> 15:27.400
    You know, Frasier,          

15:27.500 --> 15:29.300
after listening to you complain 
        about that              

15:29.400 --> 15:30.700
    for the umpteenth time,     

15:30.800 --> 15:33.900
it's becoming impossible for me 
         to sympathize.         

15:34.000 --> 15:35.800
        (quietly):              
         Of course not.         

15:35.900 --> 15:38.100
  Sympathy is a human emotion.  

15:43.600 --> 15:45.200
             What?              

15:45.200 --> 15:48.700
    Oh, I'm sorry, darling,     
     I'm just lashing out.      

15:48.800 --> 15:52.100
        (quietly):              
  Got off a good one, though.   

15:55.100 --> 15:58.400
  Frasier, you've got to stop   
this cycle of negativity.       

15:58.500 --> 16:01.800
            Come, let's try some
            positive imagery.   

16:01.900 --> 16:04.200
            You're back in Maui.

16:04.300 --> 16:08.700
            Feel the trade winds
          caressing your cheeks,

16:08.700 --> 16:12.000
             ruffling your hair.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.600
      Smell the plumeria.       

16:13.700 --> 16:17.200
    Taste the mai tai.          

16:17.300 --> 16:20.900
      Feel the gentle swaying...

16:21.000 --> 16:26.700
                  swaying of the
                  ancient palms.

16:26.800 --> 16:31.600
                The rhythm...   
                the rhythm...   

16:31.700 --> 16:34.000
                the rhythm...   

16:35.000 --> 16:37.200
                  Are you there?

16:37.300 --> 16:40.900
    Yes, I'm there.             

16:40.900 --> 16:43.500
        I'm in paradise.        

16:43.600 --> 16:45.600
         And I'm paying         
     for the whole shebang      

16:45.700 --> 16:48.100
    with my gold card.          

16:48.200 --> 16:52.400
Which was gladly accepted,      
and returned in one piece,      

16:52.500 --> 16:55.700
 by a man in a flowered sarong! 

16:55.700 --> 16:57.500
Frasier, get a grip.            

16:57.600 --> 16:59.400
    Oh, you're right,           
         you're right.          

16:59.500 --> 17:03.800
        You know,               
Sam's done me a favor actually. 

17:03.900 --> 17:06.400
Instead of spending the night   
     there in his sleazy saloon,

17:06.500 --> 17:09.900
              I'm... I'm at home
              here with my love.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.099
      I'm going to serenade you.

17:12.200 --> 17:16.500
Why, Frasier, you haven't       
done that since...              

17:17.300 --> 17:20.300
     Have you ever done that?   

17:20.400 --> 17:22.000
    Well, I'm doing it now.     

17:22.800 --> 17:24.300
  Remember this one, darling?   

17:24.300 --> 17:26.099
     (plays gentle melody)      

17:26.200 --> 17:28.800
How could I forget?             

17:28.800 --> 17:31.200
    ¶ Autumn in New York...     
¶ Moonlight in Vermont...       

17:31.300 --> 17:33.200
You sing it.                    

17:33.200 --> 17:34.600
        All right.              

17:35.600 --> 17:38.100
     ¶ Autumn in New York       

17:38.100 --> 17:43.500
      ¶ What makes it seem      
         so exciting? ¶         

17:43.500 --> 17:46.000
     ¶ Autumn in New York       

17:46.100 --> 17:49.600
     ¶ It spells the thrill     
     of first nighting... ¶     

17:49.700 --> 17:51.700
         (music stops)          

17:53.800 --> 17:57.700
It was a lovely                 
honeymoon, wasn't it?           

17:57.800 --> 18:01.600
        (voice breaks):         
      I bought this piano       
    with my gold card.          

18:01.700 --> 18:03.700
        I mean, yes, dear.      

18:03.800 --> 18:06.000
        (doorbell rings)        

18:06.100 --> 18:07.500
I'll get it.                    

18:13.300 --> 18:14.300
          Hi, Lilith.           

18:14.400 --> 18:15.600
                    Cliff, Norm.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.200
 Frasier, it's Cliff and Norm.  

18:18.600 --> 18:19.900
            Well, good night,   
                      gentlemen.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.800
         I've suddenly developed
        a splitting migraine.   

18:27.000 --> 18:28.200
          Norm. Cliff.          

18:28.300 --> 18:29.400
          What a pleasure to see
              my boon companions

18:29.500 --> 18:31.300
                here in my home.
            Come in. Come in.   

18:31.400 --> 18:33.400
    Yeah, well, Fras, look,     
we don't want to interrupt      

18:33.500 --> 18:34.800
                  your dinner or
             anything like that.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.000
 Oh, no, we finished hours ago. 

18:37.100 --> 18:38.300
  Yeah, nice shortcut, Cliff.   

18:40.800 --> 18:42.500
                  I see that you
                left the butcher

18:42.600 --> 18:44.200
        of all things plastic   
                 back in the bar

18:44.200 --> 18:45.700
                to come visit   
                    old Frasier.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.000
          Yeah, yeah.           

18:47.100 --> 18:48.300
          Fras, uh...           

18:48.300 --> 18:50.800
     just out of curiosity, what
        did you have for dinner?

18:50.900 --> 18:52.200
        Uh, uh, let me guess.   

18:52.300 --> 18:55.100
    Wait. (inhales sharply)     

18:55.100 --> 18:56.400
         Ah, porterhouse steaks,

18:56.400 --> 18:59.300
smothered with mushrooms,       
green beans with sliced almonds,

18:59.400 --> 19:02.300
  some, uh, apple brown Betty,  
          and, uh....           

19:02.300 --> 19:04.300
    decaf cappuccino.           

19:04.300 --> 19:06.100
                      (laughs)  
Ain't he something?             

19:06.100 --> 19:08.200
                Actually, we had
             Chinese brought in.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.100
  Guess it must be in my coat.  

19:13.200 --> 19:16.100
Here, come... come and sit down.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.700
You know, I can't tell you      
      how special this is.      

19:17.700 --> 19:20.100
We never seem to get together   
outside of that infernal bar.   

19:20.100 --> 19:21.700
              Never get together
                just as pals.   

19:21.800 --> 19:23.200
          Yeah, whatever.       

19:23.200 --> 19:24.800
Fras, you don't have any Chinese
         left, do you?          

19:24.900 --> 19:26.900
                      No, sorry.
Norm, Norm...                   

19:27.000 --> 19:28.600
we come here                    
to talk about a topic           

19:28.700 --> 19:30.200
a lot more important than food. 

19:30.300 --> 19:32.900
    Found an almond cookie.     

19:34.300 --> 19:35.900
     If you're here to try      
  to patch up my relationship   

19:36.000 --> 19:38.100
with Mr. Malone, just forget it.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.000
 Give me half, will you, Cliff? 

19:39.100 --> 19:39.900
                     I tell you,
                     I have seen

19:40.000 --> 19:42.200
    the last of that ex-jock    
        in a pompadour.         

19:42.300 --> 19:45.500
 Frasier, you've got to let us  
  explain what happened here.   

19:45.500 --> 19:50.200
    Fras, uh, you see,          
    sometimes guys...           

19:50.300 --> 19:53.000
do things, you know,            
which they...                   

19:53.000 --> 19:55.600
they think seem like...         

19:55.700 --> 19:57.800
a good idea at the time.        

19:57.800 --> 20:00.500
But they're really              
not such a good idea.           

20:00.500 --> 20:03.100
I guess what                    
I'm trying to say is...         

20:03.200 --> 20:06.200
That... that Sam wants me       
     to come back to Cheers     

20:06.300 --> 20:08.800
 so that he can get down on his 
knees and apologize to me       

20:08.900 --> 20:10.300
    in public and in person.    

20:10.400 --> 20:12.500
Yeah, that's even better.       

20:13.900 --> 20:15.600
Great, come on,                 
let's go.                       

20:21.000 --> 20:22.200
             Sammy,             

20:22.300 --> 20:24.000
 don't drop down on your knees  
     to beg for forgiveness     

20:24.000 --> 20:26.200
        till he's all the way   
             through the door...

20:26.300 --> 20:28.500
            but look who's here.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.200
 Hey! You brought Frasier back. 

20:30.300 --> 20:32.300
    See, now, if we can just    
    get them to erase           

20:32.400 --> 20:34.000
 everything from their memories 
    from the last 36 hours,     

20:34.100 --> 20:35.400
        we're home free.        

20:37.100 --> 20:39.200
I'm waiting, Sam.               

20:39.900 --> 20:42.300
            Waiting for what?   

20:42.400 --> 20:44.000
            Sammy, don't torture
                    your friend.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.700
      Frasier just swallowed his
     pride to come back in here,

20:46.800 --> 20:49.300
    so get down on your knees   
      and beg him to forgive you

20:49.400 --> 20:50.700
                 and then we can
              start celebrating.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.200
                      I'm sorry.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.400
Thanks, Sam.                    

20:53.500 --> 20:54.600
                        NORM:   
                  That's what we
                    like to see.

20:54.700 --> 20:57.200
Yeah, I bet you                 
nobody even remembers           

20:57.300 --> 21:00.100
what started the silly argument 
in the first place.             

21:00.100 --> 21:03.000
             I do--             
Sam cut up his gold card.       

21:05.800 --> 21:08.100
        That was funny.         

21:08.200 --> 21:10.800
                 Woody, come on,
                    we're, uh...

21:10.800 --> 21:12.200
                     you know, I
            apologized for that.

21:12.300 --> 21:13.600
                    We're beyond
                 that right now.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.300
    Is that it?                 

21:15.300 --> 21:17.800
That is the sum total           
of your contrition?             

21:19.200 --> 21:20.700
I mean, I know you're not       
Walt Whitman, Sam,              

21:20.800 --> 21:23.500
but I mean, really a couple more
"uhs" and "you knows"           

21:23.600 --> 21:25.400
would at least lend it          
a little creditability.         

21:25.500 --> 21:27.000
            Well, you didn't let
             me finish, Frasier.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.400
              I was going to say
                  that I'm sorry

21:28.500 --> 21:30.700
            that you were such a
              big jerk yesterday

21:30.700 --> 21:33.200
            and that you're such
            a big baby today.   

21:33.200 --> 21:34.500
Well, that tears it.            

21:34.600 --> 21:36.600
When I walk out this time,      
believe me when I tell you      

21:36.600 --> 21:38.300
that I will <i>never</i> brighten      
this door again.                

21:38.300 --> 21:40.100
            Wait, wait, wait,   
                     wait, wait.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.600
            Frasier, Frasier,   
                  wait a minute.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.300
    Before this thing           
    gets any further,           

21:43.400 --> 21:45.400
come on now, sit down, relax.   

21:45.500 --> 21:48.300
    I think it's time           
    that both you guys          

21:48.400 --> 21:51.500
     understand the truth.      

21:51.600 --> 21:53.200
                  Cliffie?      

21:56.900 --> 22:00.100
Well, Fras,                     
see, yesterday, uh,             

22:00.200 --> 22:02.500
Normie and I, we were           
feeling a little frisky         

22:02.600 --> 22:05.300
and as sort of a gag,           
we, uh, made a phone call       

22:05.400 --> 22:08.600
and reported                    
your credit card stolen.        

22:08.700 --> 22:11.800
                  My God, Cliff,
                  that is fraud!

22:11.900 --> 22:15.600
                 You think you  
                know a guy, Sam.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.400
         Damn it, Norm.         
            Come on.            

22:17.400 --> 22:19.200
     All right, all right,      
        all right.              

22:19.300 --> 22:21.400
                 I may have, uh,

22:21.500 --> 22:25.300
            been in the vicinity
         during that phone call.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.300
        I might have actually   
              dialed the number.

22:28.400 --> 22:32.200
      So it's your fault?       

22:32.300 --> 22:33.500
Sam, I owe you an apology.      

22:33.600 --> 22:35.100
                         No, no.
    I had no idea.              

22:35.100 --> 22:37.000
                          Boy.  

22:37.100 --> 22:39.700
      You guys are really       
  stirring it up, aren't you?   

22:42.300 --> 22:43.500
                Okay, fellas,   

22:43.600 --> 22:45.200
             give me your credit
                cards right now.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.300
                     What?      
     Aw...                      

22:47.400 --> 22:48.400
      Give me your credit cards.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.700
      You-you can't cut them up.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.500
      I'm not gonna cut them up.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.200
NORM:                           
Don't cut them up, Sam.         

22:54.300 --> 22:55.800
Woody, you're back in business. 

22:55.900 --> 22:57.200
    Shop away.                  

22:57.300 --> 22:58.800
NORM:                           
Oh, no.                         
             All right.         

22:58.800 --> 23:00.700
Get the scissors                
and cut them right now.
