01:16.242 --> 01:19.611
<i>During the long, dark period
of the Great Wars,</i>

01:19.613 --> 01:23.449
<i>an elite class of soldier
rose from battle.</i>

01:23.451 --> 01:26.518
<i>Their unbreakable code
was simple...</i>

01:26.520 --> 01:29.088
<i>Possess a noble heart
of courage,</i>

01:29.090 --> 01:33.859
<i>right conduct,</i>
<i>and absolute devotion</i>
<i>to one's master.</i>

01:33.861 --> 01:36.261
<i>From out of those years
of bloodshed,</i>

01:36.263 --> 01:39.098
<i>an empire would emerge.</i>

01:39.100 --> 01:42.201
<i>Its power would assimilate
persons of every color,</i>

01:42.203 --> 01:44.736
<i>creed, and faith.</i>

01:44.738 --> 01:46.772
<i>This uncontested rule</i>

01:46.774 --> 01:50.476
<i>eroded the traditions
of the great knights,</i>

01:50.478 --> 01:53.579
<i>but not for all.</i>

02:41.194 --> 02:44.830
Lay down your swords,
you may walk free.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.281
I'm the official envoy
of the Emperor.

03:36.283 --> 03:39.518
-I carry a message
for Lord Bartok.
-I welcome you to the castle.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.320
I will take the message.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.555
The message is for you master.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.992
Anyone who wishes
to speak with my master

03:46.994 --> 03:48.594
must first speak with me.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.396
Do you believe that the words
of the Emperor

03:51.398 --> 03:54.533
are fit for a mere retainer?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.272
I have no doubt
that your arrogance

04:00.274 --> 04:01.707
is effective in other houses.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.742
Therefore, it is a mistake
I am willing to forgive.

04:03.744 --> 04:07.980
What is your name,
foot soldier? Mm?

04:07.982 --> 04:10.515
I'm certain that the Emperor
himself would want to know

04:10.517 --> 04:12.851
who has been so charitable
toward his envoy.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.353
An introduction
would have been

04:14.355 --> 04:17.322
the right place
for you to start.

04:17.324 --> 04:20.692
I am Commander Raiden
of the Seventh Rank.

04:30.004 --> 04:33.538
Your name
is well known to me.

04:33.540 --> 04:37.276
Forgive my presumption.

04:57.764 --> 05:00.332
My Lord.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.382
This comes directly
from the capital?

05:17.384 --> 05:21.720
Sealed before my eyes
by the Emperor himself.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.756
Very well.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.471
I am ordered
to the capital

05:39.473 --> 05:41.907
to meet
with Minister Gezza Mott

05:41.909 --> 05:46.978
to review new protocols
and duties.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.648
This is a farce!

05:49.650 --> 05:53.352
The new protocol
is the bribe expected of me
at that meeting,

05:53.354 --> 05:54.953
and for no other reason

05:54.955 --> 05:57.055
than to remain
in his good favor.

05:57.057 --> 06:01.460
This minister's influence
has grown considerably
since your last term.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.795
He is favored to succeed
as First Council.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.531
I will not tolerate
this kind of bribery,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.853
either in my own pocket
or in my capital.

06:11.771 --> 06:15.474
- What are your thoughts?
- I follow you, My Lord.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.413
Since when do you speak
anything but truth?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.550
Say what you think.

06:25.552 --> 06:29.020
Well, if it's truly
the injustice of corruption
which upsets you,

06:29.022 --> 06:31.456
then perhaps you might
have been so passionately moved

06:31.458 --> 06:34.493
to act before you arrived
in your own court.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.762
What exactly do you mean
by that?

06:36.764 --> 06:39.431
I mean that it would be
prudent to examine

06:39.433 --> 06:41.533
if this is simply
a matter of pride.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.902
It's not a matter of pride,
it's a question of dignity.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.539
- So you will refuse the duty.
- I refuse the extortion!

06:47.541 --> 06:49.908
My Lord, corruption within
the capital is nothing new.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.911
How is this different
from any other absurd new tax?

06:52.913 --> 06:56.715
When a man like that
can demand a bribe
out in the open,

06:56.717 --> 06:58.583
with no fear of recourse,

06:58.585 --> 07:02.487
we're headed
for a dangerous time.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.125
What?

07:07.127 --> 07:11.530
You think
I hold on to an idealism
that no longer exists?

07:11.532 --> 07:14.566
Perhaps.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.742
- Sir?
- I'm fine.

07:23.744 --> 07:27.112
- Let me call the physician.
- He's examined me.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.982
When? What did he say?

07:33.520 --> 07:36.521
You will not speak of this
to them.

07:39.525 --> 07:42.861
Ah, my beautiful ones return.

07:46.065 --> 07:48.533
And how did your studies
go today?

07:48.535 --> 07:50.035
Lilly's music instructor
has said

07:50.037 --> 07:52.904
that she's
the most advanced student.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.841
- Of course she is.
- I think he's exaggerating.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.109
And I think he's
an astute judge of talent.

07:58.111 --> 08:01.980
Either that or he's prepared
to request a raise in his wages.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.116
Now, will you play something
for me?

08:41.921 --> 08:43.655
Good.

08:45.291 --> 08:48.093
Not all confrontations
will be one-on-one

08:48.095 --> 08:50.061
as now practice sessions.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.631
I was not aware
we were practicing
such a scenario.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.699
There are never warnings
in battle.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.801
Not all adversaries
will adhere

08:56.803 --> 08:59.070
to the warrior's code
as we do.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.040
You must always be on alert.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.611
We must begin preparations
to leave immediately.

09:06.613 --> 09:10.315
We've been summoned
to the capital.

09:10.317 --> 09:14.019
Lieutenant, will I be
joining the convoy?

09:14.021 --> 09:16.087
That is
the Commander's decision.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.189
With all respect, sir,
I believe I'm ready.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.192
If the Commander made
decisions based on what others
believed about themselves,

09:21.194 --> 09:23.762
half these men
would have my position.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.898
Gather the men
to prepare for our journey!

09:48.622 --> 09:50.689
You startled me.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.224
How long have you
been standing there?

09:53.226 --> 09:55.093
Hours.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.130
Your humor is not on par
with your stealth.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.767
It is an unfair advantage
to use your skills
upon your wife.

10:02.769 --> 10:07.672
Trust me, it is you
who has the advantage over me.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.307
And what might that be?

10:19.285 --> 10:23.688
I heard the official messengers
had arrived.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.191
I take it they didn't
carry good news.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.259
Why do you say that?

10:28.261 --> 10:31.096
You may be able
to hide your presence from me,

10:31.098 --> 10:32.897
but not your thoughts.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.869
We are summoned
to the capital.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.339
I thought you were not expected
until the turn of the season.

10:41.341 --> 10:45.210
-It is a request
from our new minister.
-For what purpose?

10:45.212 --> 10:47.946
Nothing worth disturbing
our evening for.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.181
You mean you do not wish
to discuss it.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.218
No, I mean I will soon
be apart from you

10:53.220 --> 10:56.254
and I can think
of many better things

10:56.256 --> 10:59.190
to occupy our time with.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.660
Hmm.

11:01.662 --> 11:05.163
It's difficult to argue
with that logic.

11:34.927 --> 11:36.761
Come with me.

11:40.466 --> 11:44.936
My great-grandfather,
a ferocious warrior.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.705
Not well-liked,

11:46.707 --> 11:49.207
but he was responsible
for expanding our lands

11:49.209 --> 11:52.143
into the province
it is today.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.879
My father...
He alone was responsible

11:54.881 --> 11:57.482
for protecting these lands
during the Great War.

11:57.484 --> 12:01.386
You would've taken pleasure
in knowing him.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.460
My son.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.364
I have no heir.

12:13.366 --> 12:18.036
I will be the tenth
and last generation
buried here.

12:18.038 --> 12:21.005
30 years ago this month,

12:21.007 --> 12:23.875
and against all counsel,

12:23.877 --> 12:28.246
it was idealism that led me
to invite you into my home.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.216
A young man
with an empty soul,

12:31.218 --> 12:33.017
muddied by drink,

12:33.019 --> 12:37.355
and as dark as the graves
of those who crossed his path.

12:39.792 --> 12:43.795
But it was idealism
that saw through all of that

12:43.797 --> 12:46.865
to the man I see before me.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.335
Now you give me better advice
than I give myself.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.877
When I have departed
this world,

12:58.879 --> 13:01.913
these lands
will be in your care.

13:01.915 --> 13:06.017
-My Lord.
-My name will be yours
to uphold.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.020
But your sword is
to be passed to an heir.
I am merely your retainer.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.923
You are the heir
to my spirit.

13:11.925 --> 13:15.160
Our bond has been earned,

13:15.162 --> 13:16.561
not inherited.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.864
- No, sir...
- Take the sword.

13:50.129 --> 13:53.898
- You be safe.
- Of course.

14:08.147 --> 14:10.014
Be well, my love.

14:13.419 --> 14:16.321
- You ready, Commander?
- Yes, My Lord.

14:16.323 --> 14:19.524
We have the gift
for Minister Gezza Mott?

14:19.526 --> 14:22.393
Yes,
it's all taken care of.

14:27.399 --> 14:28.933
Shhh.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.211
- Gabriel.
- Commander.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.280
Thank you
for this great honor.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.382
I knew your mother
and father well.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.504
If they were still among us,
they would be very proud.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.590
- So it begins again.
- So it does.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.709
Sit down. Sit down.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.184
Sir,
may I ask you a question?

15:53.186 --> 15:56.321
Of course.

15:56.323 --> 16:00.558
You've known the Commander
a long time, yes?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.427
Since I was your age.

16:04.730 --> 16:09.000
Is it true he was not born
into the military class?

16:10.602 --> 16:12.570
He comes from peasant stock.

16:12.572 --> 16:17.342
Orphaned as a young boy,
entire family died of the fever.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.279
Is that when Lord Bartok
took him in?

16:21.281 --> 16:25.583
No. Much later,
when he was a young man.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.621
- Why do you ask?
- Stories circulate about him.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.625
They say he was cruel
and murderous

16:34.627 --> 16:38.663
<i>without conscience or honor.</i>

16:38.665 --> 16:41.065
For many years,
he was given to the drink.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.267
The dark fog made him violent.

16:46.438 --> 16:50.508
Does knowing this
change your respect for him?

16:52.277 --> 16:55.580
One is to be admired
for rebuilding thyself,

16:55.582 --> 16:58.116
not judged.

17:00.753 --> 17:04.589
Now get some rest.
Long journey ahead tomorrow.

17:30.482 --> 17:34.118
Welcome, Lord Bartok.

17:49.501 --> 17:52.737
- Your journey went well?
- Quite.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.439
It can be long.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.674
It seemed short.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.245
I see you've come
bearing a gift.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.681
It's customary
for an official visit.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.775
- A robe.
- A fine robe.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.745
You may also keep the box.

18:41.653 --> 18:44.288
Did your retainer
attend to the gift?

18:44.290 --> 18:47.492
No, I chose it personally.

18:47.494 --> 18:51.462
Very well.
We'll begin early tomorrow.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.197
There is obviously much to do.

18:53.199 --> 18:56.200
I look forward to your review
of the new protocols.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.202
Yes, and in addition to that,
we'll get the chance

18:58.204 --> 19:00.844
to discuss the challenges
which face the future
of the Bartok lands.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.819
I don't think
he liked the color.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.521
If I'd known
what you'd intended,

19:16.523 --> 19:18.723
I would've insisted
you bring something more.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.691
More?
I gave him the box too.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.426
This is not a matter
of amusement.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.629
He has taken this
as a personal insult.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.498
-Tomorrow I will bring
a more suitable gift.
-You will not.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.433
And in my presence,
you will refer

19:29.435 --> 19:32.937
to the Minister's demand
as it really is... a bribe.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.705
Adopting the language
of the pretense

19:34.707 --> 19:37.275
only serves to ease
participation in it.

19:37.277 --> 19:41.279
My Lord, I think that
perhaps now is not the time
to take such a hard stand.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.681
And if I ease my approach now,
at what crossing

19:43.683 --> 19:46.217
would you recommend
I stand my ground?

19:46.219 --> 19:49.287
When they've
taken half my land?
When it comes to a point

19:49.289 --> 19:52.390
where I have to
exercise my own tyranny
over those beneath me

19:52.392 --> 19:54.792
to support the bribes
of those above?

19:54.794 --> 19:58.596
Who does he think he is?

19:58.598 --> 20:02.633
Perhaps he did not understand
what is expected of him.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.570
He understands perfectly.

20:05.572 --> 20:10.308
Does he arrive here
planning to make a name
for himself at my expense?

20:10.310 --> 20:12.877
Or is he so filled up
with pride

20:12.879 --> 20:15.613
that he has no room
for humility?

20:25.791 --> 20:29.727
Here, dog,
a silk for your filth!

20:56.255 --> 20:59.257
Where are we expected?

20:59.259 --> 21:01.892
There is something
I wish to show you.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.040
Such a fine sword.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.377
May I?

21:31.456 --> 21:36.394
This is a nobleman's blade.
Where did you come by it?

21:36.396 --> 21:38.829
It was a gift...

21:40.666 --> 21:42.600
from my master.

21:50.909 --> 21:54.612
I have never heard
of such generosity

21:54.614 --> 21:57.415
from lord to retainer.

22:07.392 --> 22:09.927
It seems you have won.

22:16.803 --> 22:21.105
It is my favorite room here
because it exemplifies

22:21.107 --> 22:24.108
the great virtues
of generosity and humility...

22:24.110 --> 22:25.943
Qualities necessary
to operate smoothly

22:25.945 --> 22:27.645
within the workings
of the capital.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.814
A quality
all the other noblemen

22:29.816 --> 22:32.416
whom I have received
seem to grasp.

22:32.418 --> 22:36.087
Are you beginning to understand
the points of our talk?

22:36.089 --> 22:38.489
Yes.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.524
Very impressive.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.728
You really intend giving
all this away?

22:46.865 --> 22:49.133
I'm reaching the end
of my patience with you.

22:49.135 --> 22:53.504
We can play this game
as long as you like,

22:53.506 --> 22:55.906
but you'll receive
no bribe from me.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.509
Is that what this is to you?
A game?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.077
How do you think the Emperor
would respond

23:00.079 --> 23:01.946
to his command
being thought of as a game?

23:01.948 --> 23:04.882
Since you're only threat
seems to be running
to the Emperor

23:04.884 --> 23:06.951
like a pouting child,
you should ask him

23:06.953 --> 23:08.919
- as soon as possible.
- I need not ask.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.755
You were ordered
to this review by the Emperor,

23:10.757 --> 23:12.089
and yet you reject his word.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.824
I reject any attempt by you

23:13.826 --> 23:16.560
to exert some delusional power
over me.

23:16.562 --> 23:20.464
It is you who live
under illusion, not me.

23:25.103 --> 23:28.439
I offer you no threat
but a promise.

23:28.441 --> 23:31.809
I will not only take
your property and standing,

23:31.811 --> 23:35.646
but I will turn everything
connected to the Bartok name
into dust.

23:35.648 --> 23:39.917
And when I'm done,
it will be as if neither you

23:39.919 --> 23:42.820
nor any generation before
had ever existed.

23:42.822 --> 23:47.158
You should be careful
not to overstep.

23:56.135 --> 23:59.069
Something wrong?

24:07.746 --> 24:10.448
I have known many like you,

24:10.450 --> 24:13.050
men who,
once their hairs bleed grey

24:13.052 --> 24:14.885
and their spines cut them
like daggers,

24:14.887 --> 24:16.727
come to revise
their own history.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.857
Truth is that
your innermost fear

24:19.859 --> 24:22.593
is in fact
your most striking attribute.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.695
You are irrelevant.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.031
You have neither cast a shadow
nor left any footprints

24:27.033 --> 24:29.166
upon the great legacy
of the Bartok clan.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.936
Your only achievement
was being born into nobility...

24:33.772 --> 24:37.508
and you somehow failed
to reproduce even that.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.251
Guards! Guards!

24:49.488 --> 24:51.822
You draw your blade
on a minister of the Emperor?

25:08.206 --> 25:11.208
Minister,
your father-in-law approaches.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.977
What happened?

25:12.979 --> 25:15.579
All I've been told
is that you were attacked.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.781
I cannot say too much
at this time.

25:17.783 --> 25:20.584
But we are about to witness
the wrath of the Emperor.

26:10.902 --> 26:14.638
You have been summoned

26:14.640 --> 26:18.609
before our most glorious
and wise Emperor.

26:18.611 --> 26:22.046
The prisoner who stands
before you is Lord Bartok.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.148
He has committed
the crime

26:24.150 --> 26:28.652
of attacking a loyal minister
of the Emperor.

26:28.654 --> 26:31.655
The prisoner will now
be permitted to address
his peers

26:31.657 --> 26:34.191
before our master
passes judgment.

26:43.602 --> 26:48.205
What has just been said of me
is true.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.308
I offer no argument

26:51.310 --> 26:55.045
nor dispute
the simple facts.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.781
But they hardly begin to cover

26:57.783 --> 27:00.684
the scope of my true crimes.

27:00.686 --> 27:05.723
Honor requires
more than admission,

27:05.725 --> 27:10.928
so I offer a full confession
and the whole truth.

27:10.930 --> 27:14.732
For far too long,
I failed to recognize

27:14.734 --> 27:17.635
my own hypocrisy.

27:17.637 --> 27:21.372
I ignored
my own cowardice,

27:21.374 --> 27:24.041
conveniently hiding
behind a position

27:24.043 --> 27:26.777
of political compromise.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.213
And for what?

27:29.215 --> 27:34.218
To retain the meager wealth
and rank that men desire.

27:34.220 --> 27:38.756
So I come before you
a condemned man

27:38.758 --> 27:41.325
for having finally stood up

27:41.327 --> 27:43.027
to injustice.

27:43.029 --> 27:46.930
My shame and regret

27:46.932 --> 27:49.133
is that I failed to do so

27:49.135 --> 27:51.902
before it arrived
in my own court.

27:54.439 --> 27:58.108
We supply the armies,

27:58.110 --> 28:02.012
we build the roads,

28:02.014 --> 28:05.215
we employ the nation.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.919
Still, we remain silent
while our coffers are emptied

28:08.921 --> 28:12.890
and our freedoms eroded.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.792
There will be times

28:14.794 --> 28:17.895
where we are powerless
to injustice,

28:17.897 --> 28:20.397
but there must never
be a time

28:20.399 --> 28:23.467
when we fail to protest.

28:29.140 --> 28:33.777
This man, Gezza Mott,

28:33.779 --> 28:38.716
is a cancer, growing.

28:38.718 --> 28:42.352
And the only proper thing
to do is to cut it out.

28:44.856 --> 28:48.158
You all know what I speak of.

28:48.160 --> 28:52.496
Each one of you
has been subjected

28:52.498 --> 28:54.498
to his extortion.

28:54.500 --> 28:59.436
But my words are not in judgment
of my fellow noblemen,

28:59.438 --> 29:03.107
they are a warning.

29:03.109 --> 29:07.111
I urge you to consider
what you are doing,

29:07.113 --> 29:10.047
for we are helping this man

29:10.049 --> 29:13.517
to forge the very chains
that bind us.

29:13.519 --> 29:18.155
Which brings me
to the confession

29:18.157 --> 29:20.257
of my true crime,

29:20.259 --> 29:23.327
so that I may redeem
my honor.

29:25.830 --> 29:29.233
My crime

29:29.235 --> 29:33.303
is only that I failed
to kill Gezza Mott

29:33.305 --> 29:37.141
when I had the chance.

29:52.323 --> 29:54.892
We have enjoyed
hundreds of years of peace

29:54.894 --> 29:57.494
under my family's rule.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.330
We brought order

30:00.332 --> 30:02.366
where there was chaos,

30:02.368 --> 30:06.136
peace where there was nothing
but war and bloodshed.

30:06.138 --> 30:10.440
My subjects accept their roles,
content in the knowledge

30:10.442 --> 30:13.177
they serve the greater good.

30:13.179 --> 30:17.848
If you think your words
will move your fellow noblemen
to dissent,

30:17.850 --> 30:20.551
then you're sorely misled.

30:20.553 --> 30:23.287
Are you prepared
to receive my judgment

30:23.289 --> 30:25.022
and regain your honor?

30:25.024 --> 30:28.158
I am prepared
to receive your judgment,

30:28.160 --> 30:31.361
but my honor is intact.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.431
You dare to contradict
the word of the Emperor?

30:38.102 --> 30:43.073
All those in your house
shall be evicted
from your lands.

30:43.075 --> 30:46.176
The Bartok clan is no more.

30:46.178 --> 30:51.315
And your delusions of self
require more extreme measures.

30:56.588 --> 31:03.193
Your crime and defiance
to the ordinances
of the capital

31:03.195 --> 31:06.630
shall be repaid with
nothing less than your head.

31:06.632 --> 31:09.967
-You cannot do this!
-How dare you address
the Emperor directly!

31:09.969 --> 31:14.171
My Lord, a judgment of this kind
is unprecedented for a nobleman.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.608
This display of arrogance
cannot go unanswered.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.346
What do you suggest?

31:39.964 --> 31:44.368
Your Commander
is fiercely loyal to you,
Lord Bartok.

31:45.436 --> 31:47.404
And so it is fitting

31:47.406 --> 31:49.940
that you should meet your end

31:49.942 --> 31:51.341
by his sword.

31:56.114 --> 31:58.315
Should you refuse the order,

31:58.317 --> 32:02.286
all of Lord Bartok's
blood relations shall be
executed as well.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.621
- Minister!
- First Council,

32:04.623 --> 32:07.190
the word of the Emperor
has been spoken.

32:12.230 --> 32:13.297
Commander!

32:27.145 --> 32:29.246
Let him pass.

32:55.506 --> 32:59.209
- You will do this.
- No.

32:59.211 --> 33:02.579
-I'm already dead.
-I will take death
at your side

33:02.581 --> 33:04.648
rather than participate
in this spectacle.

33:04.650 --> 33:09.219
I know you will,
but how will that serve us?

33:13.491 --> 33:17.127
My Lord...

33:17.129 --> 33:21.498
- I cannot do this.
- It's already done.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.735
Think only of what follows.

33:24.737 --> 33:29.439
The spirit of our clan
will endure through you.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.640
Commander Raiden!

33:34.312 --> 33:38.382
The Emperor's word
is not a request that
requires your decision.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.725
Remember this, Raiden,

33:48.727 --> 33:54.097
the wounds of honor
are self-inflicted.

33:59.404 --> 34:04.174
- Draw your sword.
- My Lord, please.

34:04.176 --> 34:08.411
Commander, draw your sword.

34:13.418 --> 34:18.255
Your devotion to the code
is absolute, is it not?

34:21.659 --> 34:24.795
-Yes, My Lord.
-Then, as your lord
and master,

34:24.797 --> 34:29.065
I order you
to complete this duty.

35:12.643 --> 35:15.679
From this moment on,

35:15.681 --> 35:18.348
be no more grieved
about what you have done.

37:26.477 --> 37:30.814
This will quiet
any whispers of dissent
for quite some time.

37:34.652 --> 37:38.455
We must deal
with Commander Raiden
with a quick and firm hand.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.991
Do you offer this
for our master's benefit
or your own?

37:40.993 --> 37:43.927
Did you see
how he stood before you?
He's a rabid dog, that one.

37:43.929 --> 37:47.697
We control the warriors
through their absolute loyalty
to their masters.

37:47.699 --> 37:50.033
How do you think two million
of them would react

37:50.035 --> 37:52.002
if we eliminated
one of their own

37:52.004 --> 37:54.804
for exemplifying
the virtue of loyalty?

37:54.806 --> 37:57.707
What if he should
seek vengeance?

37:57.709 --> 38:01.745
He is not to be touched.

38:01.747 --> 38:04.614
There are already
too many disavowed

38:04.616 --> 38:06.850
looking for a reason to act.

38:06.852 --> 38:11.688
If you come upon real proof
that he intends to move
against you,

38:11.690 --> 38:16.693
then I will order his death.
But not until then.

38:16.695 --> 38:21.698
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Master. Until then.

38:21.700 --> 38:25.935
Shall I see to the eviction
and the subsequent dispensing
of the Bartok lands?

38:25.937 --> 38:28.038
The lands should be
divided equally

38:28.040 --> 38:30.640
so as not to favor
one nobleman over another.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.043
Of course.
But I will not
bother our master

38:33.045 --> 38:35.011
with the details
at this time.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.380
I will
attend to it myself.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.949
I'm certain you will.

38:46.957 --> 38:49.893
You must keep aware
of the Minister, My Lord.

38:49.895 --> 38:54.464
I know you do not approve
of Gezza Mott,

38:54.466 --> 38:58.702
but his ambition and greed
serve my interests well.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.037
Yes, My Lord.

39:14.051 --> 39:15.418
Hannah.

39:18.889 --> 39:19.923
Father.

39:48.486 --> 39:52.789
Auguste! I hear your crops
were plentiful this season.

39:54.759 --> 39:56.993
Yes, they were.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.729
So the lands I took
and gave over to you
proved sufficient

39:59.731 --> 40:01.898
in replacing the dying ones
you had when we first met?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.401
They have.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.636
Perfect.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.107
Now tell me,
you knew Lord Bartok.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.076
What do you know
of his retainer?

40:13.078 --> 40:16.413
I did not know Bartok
that well,

40:16.415 --> 40:18.748
though we had
a few dealings.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.652
As to this Raiden,
I only know of him
through rumor.

40:22.654 --> 40:25.422
Tales of his violent past.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.524
You spent time with him.
What is your assessment?

40:27.526 --> 40:31.161
I would be shocked
if he were to let this go.

40:31.163 --> 40:34.964
I ask that you send me
a thousand of your men

40:34.966 --> 40:37.033
to increase my security
until this is over with.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.701
- A thousand?
- Yes.

40:38.703 --> 40:40.503
That is more than half
my retainer.

40:40.505 --> 40:42.906
All of whom you have
because of me.

40:45.609 --> 40:49.045
Would you prefer to return
to the impoverished state
you were in

40:49.047 --> 40:52.182
before I graciously
took your daughter as my wife?

41:00.758 --> 41:02.625
No, Minister.

41:06.096 --> 41:08.064
You will oversee
the eviction.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.200
After that,
and for as long as it takes,

41:10.202 --> 41:12.769
I want eyes upon Raiden
every minute of the day.

41:12.771 --> 41:16.139
When he decides to strike,
we will be ready.

42:43.694 --> 42:45.562
Sir!

42:45.564 --> 42:49.165
Are we going
to let this happen?

42:50.935 --> 42:53.269
- We won't leave without a fight!
- Yeah!

42:53.271 --> 42:56.940
Everyone must pack
their things and leave.

42:56.942 --> 42:59.976
Palace guard
is already on its way.

42:59.978 --> 43:03.179
We're simply to be thrown
out into the street
with nothing?

43:03.181 --> 43:05.315
How are we supposed
to support ourselves?

43:05.317 --> 43:08.184
Commander,
are we to understand

43:08.186 --> 43:10.687
that you would
have us do nothing?

43:10.689 --> 43:13.823
Our master is dead.

43:13.825 --> 43:16.759
I'm no longer your commander.

43:19.330 --> 43:23.299
From now on,
you owe allegiance
to no one but yourselves.

43:27.671 --> 43:29.739
Gentlemen,

43:32.910 --> 43:35.712
you are disavowed.

44:22.693 --> 44:24.093
Don't touch her!

44:26.096 --> 44:28.431
These people
are losing their home.

44:28.433 --> 44:32.068
You will treat them
with respect.

46:17.307 --> 46:19.242
Where are you going?

46:26.016 --> 46:29.318
- I'll have a drink here!
- Round for my friends.

47:32.349 --> 47:34.050
That's all of it?

47:34.052 --> 47:36.519
Well, it's barely enough
to meet our expenses.

47:36.521 --> 47:39.121
Tonight we'll treat ourselves
to a good meal in the city.

47:39.123 --> 47:40.923
It will do you good.

47:40.925 --> 47:44.227
All right.
Well, I'll be on my way.

47:44.229 --> 47:46.863
The roads into the market
will already be busy.

48:07.251 --> 48:08.651
Did you see?

48:10.287 --> 48:13.456
Your father gave me
my own brand.

48:13.458 --> 48:15.324
That's wonderful.

48:15.326 --> 48:17.593
He's never taken
to an apprentice so quickly.

48:17.595 --> 48:20.363
And I hope soon
to stop saying "apprentice"

48:20.365 --> 48:22.064
and start saying son.

48:22.066 --> 48:25.334
Now add your mark.
We have to be going.

48:59.102 --> 49:00.937
Once they have done
installing the panels,

49:00.939 --> 49:03.205
we will continue
with the floors.

49:03.207 --> 49:04.674
Yes, sir.

49:19.222 --> 49:22.291
Cannot find a dagger
like this anywhere
in the land.

49:26.263 --> 49:28.731
- Token of my deep respect.
- Support such as yours

49:28.733 --> 49:31.033
is how our nation
grows in strength.

49:31.035 --> 49:34.103
You can be certain your request
for tax relief will be heard.

49:34.105 --> 49:36.138
Thank you, Minister.

49:37.407 --> 49:41.010
- Are you almost done?
- Yes.

49:41.012 --> 49:43.112
Perhaps my body
would have the strength

49:43.114 --> 49:46.248
to rid itself of this memento
if I had a physician
of real skill.

49:46.250 --> 49:48.651
I have followed
the proper treatment.

49:48.653 --> 49:51.687
Something seems to prevent
the wound from closing.

49:51.689 --> 49:54.089
Is that what you offer
as an explanation?

49:55.092 --> 49:56.692
"Something"?

49:58.628 --> 50:01.297
Get out!

50:05.669 --> 50:08.070
Why did you send
a servant away?

50:09.573 --> 50:12.108
You do not allow
for interruptions
when in conference.

50:12.110 --> 50:14.276
Did you consider
that the servant is required

50:14.278 --> 50:17.480
to taste everything
she brings me for the threat
of poisoning?

50:19.116 --> 50:20.783
No?

50:20.785 --> 50:23.719
Or perhaps you were fully aware
and you feigned ignorance.

50:23.721 --> 50:25.755
- Of course not.
- And I'm expected

50:25.757 --> 50:27.797
to take your word
simply because you're my wife?

50:33.063 --> 50:34.797
The tea's getting cold.

51:04.261 --> 51:06.341
It appears the tea
is not poisoned.

51:18.708 --> 51:20.776
How is the gate coming along?

51:28.085 --> 51:32.588
This iron gate is capable
of holding back
an entire army.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.523
Perhaps,
once it is installed,

51:34.525 --> 51:36.292
we could release
some of the extra guards

51:36.294 --> 51:38.494
on loan
from your father-in-law.
Providing for them

51:38.496 --> 51:41.430
has brought us outside
the parameters of our budget.

51:41.432 --> 51:43.833
The cost
will not be an issue.

51:45.869 --> 51:48.704
The cost of the pavilion
now stands at five times

51:48.706 --> 51:50.639
the approved estimate.
Without the gold leaf...

51:50.641 --> 51:54.410
As stimulating as your accounts
of my accounting are,

51:54.412 --> 51:56.645
I need a word in private
with my commander.

52:01.485 --> 52:05.488
- What news have you for me?
- More of the same.

52:05.490 --> 52:08.624
- And his men?
- Scattered about.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.227
Finding employment
where they can.

52:11.229 --> 52:14.597
-Has he had any contact
with them?
-No.

52:14.599 --> 52:17.199
And yet he still remains
in the capital.

52:17.201 --> 52:22.204
We have eyes upon him
every moment of the day
and night.

52:22.206 --> 52:26.208
He's patient.
But his act doesn't fool me.

52:26.210 --> 52:28.577
Nor should it you.

52:28.579 --> 52:31.147
Prod him.

52:31.149 --> 52:34.216
Find out what he's hiding.

52:39.222 --> 52:41.323
Please follow me.
Look who is here.

52:44.662 --> 52:47.429
- Lieutenant.
- Please sit, everyone.

52:47.431 --> 52:49.665
- Bring us some more to drink.
- Gabriel.

52:49.667 --> 52:53.903
So, what do you say
about my establishment?

52:53.905 --> 52:58.307
-Certainly
it is a good fit for you.
-A perfect fit.

52:58.309 --> 53:00.543
And you, how are you
keeping yourselves?

53:00.545 --> 53:03.379
I'm managing the fishing boats
of a wealthy merchant.

53:03.381 --> 53:05.548
Gabriel is working
for them also.

53:05.550 --> 53:08.184
That would explain
your distinctive fragrance.

53:08.186 --> 53:10.519
And the reason my wife
allows me to remain here alone.

53:10.521 --> 53:11.854
No other woman will touch me.

53:11.856 --> 53:14.857
Perhaps without compensation.

53:16.493 --> 53:20.262
- Half price for you.
- No, thank you.

53:21.398 --> 53:23.332
I will accept that offer.

53:23.334 --> 53:25.201
Once you begin paying
for your drinks,

53:25.203 --> 53:29.271
I will consider extending
my discounts to others.

53:30.574 --> 53:32.808
Gentlemen,
to your prosperity.

53:32.810 --> 53:35.211
-That way you will
further increase mine.
-Hear, hear.

53:35.213 --> 53:36.812
Cheers.

53:38.648 --> 53:42.318
- And you, Jim?
- I work when I can.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.919
Maybe there's some work
at the harbor.

53:43.921 --> 53:45.721
- Should I inquire?
- No.

53:45.723 --> 53:48.357
Such...
Such a labor's not for me.

53:48.359 --> 53:50.559
Between your poverty
and his smell,

53:50.561 --> 53:53.721
I must be sitting with
the two loneliest men
in the capital.

53:55.366 --> 53:57.046
Indeed, we're
the two loneliest men.

54:04.908 --> 54:08.010
He spends
most of his days here now.

54:14.284 --> 54:16.585
Though you told me
he had fallen back
to his old ways,

54:16.587 --> 54:19.989
I find it hard to believe.

54:19.991 --> 54:24.627
He appears to be better
than usual tonight.

54:24.629 --> 54:28.297
-I must be going.
-Please, do not leave
on account of him.

54:28.299 --> 54:31.033
It sickens me to be
in his presence.

54:31.035 --> 54:34.303
Lieutenant. Lieutenant!

54:38.608 --> 54:39.675
Where you going?

54:42.479 --> 54:44.446
Come and have a drink
with me.

54:46.283 --> 54:48.717
I'm no longer your lieutenant.

55:16.880 --> 55:19.581
Raiden, wake up.

55:27.858 --> 55:29.992
Here, drink this.

55:40.403 --> 55:42.671
Let us get you home.

55:44.474 --> 55:46.375
I'm fine.

55:46.377 --> 55:50.546
-Let me help.
You can barely walk.
-I don't need your help.

55:50.548 --> 55:52.614
I'm fine.

56:01.658 --> 56:03.659
You will not find anyone
better than me

56:03.661 --> 56:05.794
to teach your son
how to wield a sword.

56:05.796 --> 56:07.730
I gave you my offer.

56:07.732 --> 56:10.632
And I don't see anyone else
here bidding on your talents.

56:12.969 --> 56:15.904
So do you accept my offer?

56:15.906 --> 56:17.806
'Cause I have no more time
to waste.

56:17.808 --> 56:21.777
Yeah, good luck with your son.
He's gonna need it.

56:21.779 --> 56:24.613
And then I saw him coming
out of Gezza Mott's front gates.

56:24.615 --> 56:28.050
How? He would have
never been allowed
within the Minister's walls.

56:28.052 --> 56:30.519
He's working
as a metal worker's apprentice

56:30.521 --> 56:32.454
and has an entirely
new identity.

56:32.456 --> 56:34.089
I questioned others
in the square about him.

56:34.091 --> 56:36.458
He must've been
in desperate need of work.

56:36.460 --> 56:38.827
I'm certain that
the Minister would pay
handsomely to know

56:38.829 --> 56:42.464
that one of Bartok's men
has created a false identity

56:42.466 --> 56:45.901
in order to work
right under his nose.

56:49.774 --> 56:52.508
Shall we?

56:52.510 --> 56:55.577
The first thing I'll do
with my newfound fortune

56:55.579 --> 56:58.113
is obtain lodging closer
to drinking establishments.

57:00.651 --> 57:03.185
- I like the sound of that.
- And then I'll earn my...

57:20.937 --> 57:22.805
You're late.

57:24.641 --> 57:28.577
Jim saw you leaving
Gezza Mott's today.

57:28.579 --> 57:30.646
He was gonna bring
that information to Gezza Mott

57:30.648 --> 57:32.181
with hopes of a reward.

57:34.717 --> 57:36.597
I was left
with no other choice.

57:39.656 --> 57:42.458
- It is my fault.
- Not your fault.

57:42.460 --> 57:45.527
Jim was willing to sacrifice
your life for his own rewards.

57:47.163 --> 57:50.132
That's it, we cannot
have any more mistakes.

57:50.134 --> 57:51.800
Do you have the credentials?

57:54.137 --> 57:59.074
Gezza Mott's compound
is now the most fortified
complex in the nation.

57:59.076 --> 58:02.010
Gaining entry is not only
going to be difficult,

58:02.012 --> 58:05.781
it is probably impossible.

58:05.783 --> 58:09.017
The only point
of direct access is here,
at the main gates.

58:12.155 --> 58:14.857
<i>The drawbridge is raised
at sundown,</i>

58:14.859 --> 58:17.693
<i>when the day workers
must exit.</i>

58:17.695 --> 58:21.063
It <i> must be operated</i>
<i>at both sides at the same time</i>
<i>in order to cross.</i>

58:29.205 --> 58:31.006
We have to
take control of it

58:31.008 --> 58:35.110
from the outside, here,
and the inside, here.

58:35.112 --> 58:37.946
<i>Past the main gates,
soldiers' barracks.</i>

58:37.948 --> 58:40.816
250 soldiers sleep here
every night,

58:40.818 --> 58:42.851
<i>fully armed
and ready to fight.</i>

58:42.853 --> 58:44.920
<i>We won't be able to
fend them off if we wake them.</i>

58:44.922 --> 58:46.688
Once past
the soldiers' barracks,

58:46.690 --> 58:48.590
<i>we must enter
the garden maze.</i>

58:48.592 --> 58:51.660
<i>It's the only way to traverse
the compound unseen.</i>

58:51.662 --> 58:54.796
Not only do I have to
prune every tree,

58:54.798 --> 58:56.765
but since the Minister's
chambers are set so high,

58:56.767 --> 58:58.767
I have ensure the gardens
look good from above.

58:58.769 --> 59:00.969
<i>That brings us to the pavilion.</i>

59:00.971 --> 59:04.540
<i>It is the only point
of cover before the castle.</i>

59:04.542 --> 59:08.010
If we are able to survive
the torrent of arrows
raining down upon us,

59:08.012 --> 59:11.213
we'll finally reach
the iron gates of the residence.

59:13.082 --> 59:16.151
Absolutely impossible
to open from the outside.

59:18.121 --> 59:21.557
- Sir, I must be going.
- Yes, of course.

59:21.559 --> 59:24.726
- Where you going?
- To see his girl.

59:24.728 --> 59:26.862
Why are we spending time
on this

59:26.864 --> 59:29.865
when we could be hearing
the young one's tales
of innocence lost?

59:29.867 --> 59:32.834
Leave the boy be.
Mind yourself.

59:36.606 --> 59:40.309
Here are the forged
documents necessary
for working inside the compound.

59:57.827 --> 01:00:00.996
I must do some repairs
to the roof of your watchtower.

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:04.199
The previous carpenter
did not do very good work.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:07.336
With the wages they pay us,
who could blame him?

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.372
I sold three baskets today.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.045
Something wrong?

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.850
I'm tired of eating nothing
but rice.

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:58.120
If I was not
the only one working,

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:00.756
perhaps we could afford
something else.

01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:18.040
Why are you still doing this?

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:20.075
There's no shame
in feeling grief,
but destroying yourself

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:23.245
-will not bring
Lord Bartok back.
-Spare me your insight.

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:28.884
That is all we have left.

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:31.086
Why not stay in with me?
Just one night!

01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:33.255
And watch you
weave more baskets?

01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:35.457
Please, Raiden!

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:37.993
Please.

01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:41.063
I cannot do this
for much longer.

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:41.583
Where is it?

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.561
- Where is it?
- What?

01:03:52.563 --> 01:03:54.563
Your sword.

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:59.167
Oh.

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:07.609
Here it is.

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.956
I'm leaving.

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:23.325
I agree.

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:26.862
This is not
the type of establishment
for a respectable woman.

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:29.998
I'm leaving you.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.100
I have struggled
with the hope that
you'd come back to me,

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:34.369
return to being the man
I married.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:38.573
But that you'd sell your sword
only proves you never will.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:48.416
If you have something
to say to me to make me
think otherwise,

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:51.353
now is the time.

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:20.315
Sir, the Minister
has been summoned.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:35.497
His wisdom and loyalty
will forever be remembered.

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.176
Come with me.

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:54.582
Before his passing,
First Council recommended

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:58.119
I pay attention to
your dealings with the noblemen.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:01.957
He believed your methods
are exceeding political

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.125
and moral propriety.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.194
There is a balance
to be maintained

01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:08.463
between dominance
and patronage.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:11.299
Your initial gesture
as First Council

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:16.037
will be a new tax relief
for both the citizens
and the noblemen.

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:22.277
It is the great honor
of my life to serve you
in this capacity.

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:25.580
Your appointment
also brings to an end

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:29.050
any and all bribes demanded
of the noblemen.

01:06:29.052 --> 01:06:31.119
In your capacity
as Minister,

01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:33.521
there was sufficient distance
between us

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.523
that I could allow you
such freedom.

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:39.060
But no more.
It is not needed.

01:06:39.062 --> 01:06:41.563
And this obsession
of yours with Raiden

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:44.332
will cease immediately.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:48.003
You surround yourself
with more security than I.

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:49.604
It's an embarrassment to you.

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:53.108
He has already
destroyed himself.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:57.412
Accept that you've emerged
the stronger with some dignity.

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:01.750
Yes, Master.

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:07.589
I thank you
for your guidance and wisdom.

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:11.426
Does he not understand
that I'm under siege?

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:15.030
My Lord, I believe Raiden
is no longer a threat to you.

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:18.633
- Why?
- He has sold his sword.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:21.369
And?

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:24.172
A warrior disposing
of his sword

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:26.775
can only be interpreted
in one way.

01:07:26.777 --> 01:07:30.345
He has abandoned all attachment
to his former self.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:32.414
You think to pacify me
with this?

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:35.116
Who cares
about a piece of metal?

01:07:35.118 --> 01:07:38.286
Do you think you can
obscure your failure
to expose him

01:07:38.288 --> 01:07:42.590
by using this juvenile
warrior's code as justification?

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:45.493
Leave me.

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:48.496
I will decide
what need be done.

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:12.120
Show yourself.
Show yourself!

01:08:12.122 --> 01:08:14.556
Show yourself!

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.136
My husband requests you.

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:40.615
These unfolding paths
have been quite interesting,

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.250
when you consider them.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:50.158
As I ascend to the apex
of my ambitions,

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.260
he sinks further
into the abyss.

01:08:53.761 --> 01:08:56.731
In recognizing that symmetry,
if you were him,

01:08:56.733 --> 01:09:01.435
could you allow
such a personal disgrace
and affront to go unanswered?

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:04.839
No.
So I've come to realize

01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:09.444
that we're dealing
with someone of such
profound internal damage

01:09:09.446 --> 01:09:13.148
that he has simply
not been pushed far enough.

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:24.292
Find me Lord Bartok's family.

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:32.834
Do you take issue
with anything asked of you?

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:36.371
Not at all.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.939
And for this price,

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:41.876
there's not much
I would take issue with.

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:25.987
Commander.

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:34.762
I have a surprise
for you tonight.

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:37.999
A new selection.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:51.579
And listen,
no negotiating on this one.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.482
She's still a virgin.

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:09.897
Raiden.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.275
Raiden.

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:29.984
You have come for me.

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:45.700
What is wrong?

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:52.573
You have come to take me,

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:55.576
have you not?

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.752
Raiden.

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:10.024
Please! Please!

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:14.662
Please! No! No!

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.700
Raiden! Raiden!

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:24.539
Raiden!

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:27.408
Raiden, help me!

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:31.646
No!

01:12:31.648 --> 01:12:33.414
No!

01:12:33.416 --> 01:12:35.850
Don't leave me.

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:11.419
It is over.

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:22.497
<i>There is nothing left to do.</i>

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:24.832
Are you sure?

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:26.968
Perhaps he simply
didn't care for the girl.

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:29.904
Are you listening to me?

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:34.809
His master's daughter
was presented to him as a whore,

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:37.712
and he did nothing.

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:41.149
<i>He cares for nothing.</i>

01:13:41.151 --> 01:13:46.487
<i>Not honor, not his family,
not himself,</i>

01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:48.489
and certainly not you.

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:00.768
At last,

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:04.972
I'm free of this.

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:13.047
Well done! Well done!

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:32.800
I've marked where the urns
are buried.

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.059
You did well.

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:58.986
We have planned,

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:02.223
we have sacrificed,

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:06.027
we have waited
for the right moment.

01:16:06.029 --> 01:16:07.862
And now...

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:14.869
it is time.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:03.050
Auguste, welcome.

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:07.355
I see you come bearing
quite the gift.

01:17:07.357 --> 01:17:10.157
I wanted to give you
something special

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:13.894
to recognize
your well-earned appointment

01:17:13.896 --> 01:17:17.031
and to thank you
for returning my men.

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:34.048
Of all the gifts
I have received,

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:37.084
this is my favorite.

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:42.289
I'll have a short visit
with my daughter

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.725
before my journey home
with my guards.

01:17:44.727 --> 01:17:48.195
Yes, yes,
that will be fine.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:16.090
Honor is something
that all men are born with.

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:19.293
It cannot be taken from you,

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:23.831
nor can it be granted.

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:26.834
It must only not be lost.

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:34.275
<i>We now stand at the door
of our final great act.</i>

01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:38.879
<i>Tonight, our enemy
will bear witness</i>

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:42.416
<i>to the unbreakable code
of the Seventh Rank.</i>

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:51.792
We will reclaim
what they tried to take.

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:58.299
We will restore the name
of our master...

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:06.474
- the voice of our people...

01:19:06.476 --> 01:19:09.744
and the spirit
of our nation.

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:47.748
Guard! Guard!

01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:59.726
Hold them
as long as you can.

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.481
- It is him!
- Stay in your chambers.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:57.718
Why did I ever trust you?
I told you, you imbecile!

01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.920
Remain in your chambers!

01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:03.223
Open the flaps!
Ready the archers!

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:25.946
Lord Bartok was my oldest
and dearest friend.

01:26:25.948 --> 01:26:29.783
I knew you would not allow
this disgrace

01:26:29.785 --> 01:26:32.553
- to go unavenged.
- My master told me that

01:26:32.555 --> 01:26:34.721
should I be left
without anyone to trust,

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:37.257
that I could always trust you.

01:26:37.259 --> 01:26:40.594
I offer my help
in any manner you need.

01:26:40.596 --> 01:26:44.598
But with a condition...

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.368
<i>You ensure
my daughter's freedom</i>

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:50.337
<i>from that man.</i>

01:26:50.339 --> 01:26:52.773
- I give you my word.
- Tell me what you need.

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:15.495
Find somewhere safe to hide.

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:19.833
Wait.

01:27:19.835 --> 01:27:22.236
Thank you.

01:28:37.679 --> 01:28:39.546
Let's go!

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:07.227
Did I do well?

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:11.031
You fought well.

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:14.935
You fought well.

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.847
We have come for Gezza Mott.

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:04.518
I can no more back down
than you.

01:37:52.466 --> 01:37:55.368
You think you're a hero?

01:37:59.306 --> 01:38:04.244
You will be remembered only
as a traitor and a disgrace.

01:38:06.146 --> 01:38:08.982
Only time will tell
how we are remembered.

01:38:11.619 --> 01:38:15.388
Something you...

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:17.190
no longer have.

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:54.460
Who is it? We're closed.

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:55.555
Your father's honor
has been reclaimed.

01:40:03.163 --> 01:40:06.265
The Bartok name
will never be forgotten.

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:15.208
Thank you.

01:40:25.319 --> 01:40:29.255
To wage an attack
on the First Council,

01:40:29.257 --> 01:40:32.792
the flagrant disregard
of my power...

01:40:32.794 --> 01:40:36.629
It will not go unanswered.
The only question is,

01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:39.565
how severe the punishment,

01:40:39.567 --> 01:40:43.336
how many generations
of each should I wipe out.

01:40:52.212 --> 01:40:54.213
The only reason
you are all here

01:40:54.215 --> 01:40:57.350
is because I am without
a First Council.

01:40:57.352 --> 01:40:59.552
Now will someone
speak their mind?

01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:04.123
My Lord, it would be prudent
to recognize

01:41:04.125 --> 01:41:07.527
that to the people,
these men are heroes.

01:41:07.529 --> 01:41:10.263
- Heroes?
<i>- To the people,</i>

01:41:10.265 --> 01:41:14.734
<i>these men stand for the virtues
that made our nation great.</i>

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:20.473
<i>Virtues once exemplified
by all warriors.</i>

01:41:20.475 --> 01:41:25.211
<i>Now hardly to be found
in any.</i>

01:41:25.213 --> 01:41:29.549
<i>If your punishment
is seen to be unjust...</i>

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:34.087
<i>you chance
turning these warriors</i>

01:41:34.089 --> 01:41:38.091
<i>into martyrs
for a cause against you.</i>

01:41:38.093 --> 01:41:41.527
However, if we treat them
with the respect

01:41:41.529 --> 01:41:44.297
befitting
an honorable warrior,

01:41:44.299 --> 01:41:47.100
we align these heroes
with us.

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:59.145
I cannot allow
such transgression
to go unpunished.

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:02.448
Everyone must be reminded

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:06.219
that no one can stand
against the Emperor.

01:42:06.221 --> 01:42:08.287
My Emperor...

01:42:10.724 --> 01:42:14.527
may I offer a solution?

01:42:14.529 --> 01:42:16.362
<i>I have one more request.</i>

01:42:16.364 --> 01:42:19.899
If we are to succeed,
the Emperor's first instinct

01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:22.502
will be to take
the heads of each of my men
and their families.

01:42:22.504 --> 01:42:25.838
-You are correct.
-But, as with all
his decisions,

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.540
he will first seek advice.

01:42:27.542 --> 01:42:29.675
Without a First Council
at his side,

01:42:29.677 --> 01:42:35.615
-he will be open
to the voices of others.
-You mean to say mine.

01:42:35.617 --> 01:42:37.850
<i>My men accept that death
will be waiting for them</i>

01:42:37.852 --> 01:42:41.387
<i>upon completion of our task.</i>

01:42:41.389 --> 01:42:43.823
<i>They are warriors
of the Seventh Rank.</i>

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:49.362
<i>They will not ask
for a reprieve.</i>

01:42:49.364 --> 01:42:51.764
But I ask it for them.

01:42:51.766 --> 01:42:53.933
And not yourself?

01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:59.472
<i>These warriors
are nameless to most.</i>

01:42:59.474 --> 01:43:01.841
<i>But one stands apart.</i>

01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:08.814
One is known to all.

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:28.834
Commander.

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:37.543
-What is this?
-You are to assume command
at the castle.

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:39.312
No.

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:41.594
Commander.

01:43:44.618 --> 01:43:46.886
Commander,
you cannot do this.

01:43:46.888 --> 01:43:51.724
We stand with you.
I stand with you.

01:43:51.726 --> 01:43:54.727
Lieutenant, your devotion
to the code is absolute,
is it not?

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:58.497
Yes.

01:43:58.499 --> 01:44:01.234
Then as your commander,

01:44:01.236 --> 01:44:03.769
I order you

01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:06.472
to take control
of the Bartok clan.

01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:46.579
<i>It is with benevolent wisdom
and esteem</i>

01:44:46.581 --> 01:44:50.549
that the Emperor proclaims
these noble warriors

01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:52.818
as heroes of the people.

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:56.355
<i>They are a shining example
and a reminder</i>

01:44:56.357 --> 01:44:59.759
<i>of those values
that bind us</i>

01:44:59.761 --> 01:45:02.461
<i>as one great nation.</i>

01:45:02.463 --> 01:45:06.432
However, no matter
what the circumstance,

01:45:06.434 --> 01:45:09.669
<i>an attack on a member
of the Emperor's council</i>

01:45:09.671 --> 01:45:14.440
is by law
considered an attack
on the Emperor himself

01:45:14.442 --> 01:45:16.575
<i>and our great nation.</i>

01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:25.878
I'm sorry.

01:46:27.414 --> 01:46:31.751
I am so sorry for all
you've had to endure.

01:46:31.753 --> 01:46:35.755
Acting the part
was not difficult.

01:46:35.757 --> 01:46:38.624
Wondering if
I was truly losing you

01:46:38.626 --> 01:46:41.660
was unbearable.
