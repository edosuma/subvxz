I love Christmas.

00:04.571 --> 00:09.575
Always have.

00:09.709 --> 00:11.243
And I loved that Christmas was

00:11.378 --> 00:12.845
just as much about giving as

00:12.979 --> 00:14.780
receiving.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.648
That's me, Gina Gina.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.517
Even recorded a Christmas song,

00:18.651 --> 00:19.685
became a huge hit.

00:19.819 --> 00:20.486
You remember,

00:20.620 --> 00:24.523
"Where My Santa At?"

00:24.657 --> 00:27.459
It was fate that Franklin and I

00:27.594 --> 00:30.329
were married on Christmas Day.

00:30.463 --> 00:31.964
Christmas was always special to

00:32.098 --> 00:33.532
me, but that beautiful day at

00:33.666 --> 00:35.167
the Chesterton Hotel, it became

00:35.301 --> 00:38.570
special to both of us.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.372
We always said "No challenge",

00:40.507 --> 00:42.074
big or small, will stop us.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.842
We'll work through them all.

00:43.977 --> 00:47.212
"Together."

00:47.347 --> 00:48.547
We both started crushing it

00:48.681 --> 00:49.761
in our careers in the music

00:49.883 --> 00:52.951
industry.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.586
So you trade in the hustle of

00:54.721 --> 00:56.321
the concrete jungle for room to

00:56.456 --> 00:57.856
breathe, something new, and

00:57.991 --> 00:58.991
hopefully better.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.573
She's in good hands. >> Remember when we had
that big fight a while back, when I came.

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:01.776
Remember when we had that big fight a
while back, when I came home at dawn?

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:03.444
Fight a while back, when I came
home at dawn? I was dead-ass wrong.

01:18:03.446 --> 01:18:05.112
Home at dawn? I was dead-ass wrong.
I should have called.

01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:07.214
I was dead-ass wrong. I should have called.
You're my wife, and that was

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:08.315
I should have called. You're my
wife, and that was insensitive.

01:18:08.317 --> 01:18:11.786
You're my wife, and that was insensitive.
It was crass and...

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:13.988
insensitive. It was crass and...
I guess what I'm trying to say.

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:16.123
It was crass and... I guess what I'm trying
to say is that, Regina, I am really,

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.759
I guess what I'm trying to say is that,
Regina, I am really, really sorry.

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:20.428
Is that, Regina, I am really, really sorry.
Franklin, it doesn't even

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:22.063
really sorry. >> Franklin, it doesn't
even matter at this point because.

01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:23.664
Franklin, it doesn't even matter at this
point because we'll never be what we once

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:25.466
matter at this point because we'll
never be what we once were.

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:27.168
We'll never be what we once were.
We'll be divorced in, what, two

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:27.668
were. We'll be divorced
in, what, two hours?

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:28.703
We'll be divorced in, what, two hours?
Don't you get it?

01:18:28.705 --> 01:18:30.438
Hours? Don't you get it?
Yeah, no, I get it.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.272
Don't you get it? >> Yeah, no, I get it.
It's just...

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:32.940
Yeah, no, I get it. It's just...
Look, I don't want to be alone.

01:18:32.942 --> 01:18:36.110
It's just... Look, I don't want
to be alone this Christmas.

01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:41.982
Look, I don't want to be alone this
Christmas. I don't think you do, either.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:51.192
Hey! >> May I have this dance?
Uh, you're kidding, right?

01:18:51.194 --> 01:18:53.060
May I have this dance? >> Uh, you're kidding,
right? Okay, look, you can, but promise.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:54.829
Uh, you're kidding, right? Okay, look, you can,
but promise me you're not gonna bug out on.

01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:55.329
Okay, look, you can, but promise
me you're not gonna bug out on me.

01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:57.098
Me you're not gonna bug out on me.
I can do that.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.632
Me. >> I can do that. >> Okay.

01:18:58.634 --> 01:19:01.202
I can do that. >> Okay. >>

to your parents house. That way, you

01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:17.651
That way, you could be there on

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:19.220
Christmas Day. >> You would do that?
I mean, I am still your.

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:21.455
You would do that? >> I

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:24.692
I mean, I am still your husband.
For another 120 minutes.

01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:25.893
Husband. For another 120 minutes.
I don't know, the snow.

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:26.961
For another 120 minutes. >> I don't
know, the snow outside's pretty bad.

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:28.596
I don't know, the snow outside's
pretty bad. >> Regina, I got chains on my

01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:30.431
outside's pretty bad. >> Regina, I
got chains on my truck, remember?

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:32.600
Regina, I got chains on my truck,
remember? Has it really been that long?

01:19:32.602 --> 01:19:33.768
Truck, remember? Has it really been
that long? >> It feels like almost a.

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:39.140
Has it really been that long? >>
It feels like almost a lifetime.

01:19:39.142 --> 01:19:40.808
It feels like almost a lifetime.
As we held each other for

01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:42.676
lifetime. >> As we held each other
for what seemed to be the last time,

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:44.545
As we held each other for what seemed to be the
last time, I closed my eyes, and wished for

01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:46.413
what seemed to be the last time, I closed my eyes,
and wished for a Christmas like the ones we had

01:19:46.415 --> 01:19:49.350
I closed my eyes, and wished for a Christmas
like the ones we had in the past.

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.051
A Christmas like the ones we had in the
past. We never made it to my parents'

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:51.585
in the past. We never made
it to my parents' house.

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:53.621
We never made it to my parents' house.
The snow was too heavy.

01:19:53.623 --> 01:19:54.955
House. The snow was too heavy.
So we settled for the apartment.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.123
The snow was too heavy. So we settled for
the apartment where we had begun our life.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:56.857
So we settled for the apartment where
we had begun our life together.

01:19:56.859 --> 01:19:57.992
Where we had begun our life together.
Who knew the snow wasn't the

01:19:57.994 --> 01:19:59.293
together. Who knew the snow wasn't the
only Christmas surprise I was in.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.895
Who knew the snow wasn't the only
Christmas surprise I was in for?

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:18.405
You decorated. >> Yeah. You
know I love Christmas, too.

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:20.481
Yeah. You know I love Christmas, too.
Hasn't been the same without you.

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:23.050
You know I love Christmas, too. Hasn't
been the same without you here, though.

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:25.853
Hasn't been the same without you here,
though. >> The tree is perfect.

01:20:25.855 --> 01:20:27.321
Here, though. >> The tree is perfect.
I don't know about that.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:28.989
The tree is perfect. >> I don't know about
that. It kind of reminds me of the one.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:29.590
I don't know about that. It kind
of reminds me of the one that...

01:20:29.592 --> 01:20:34.028
It kind of reminds me of the one that...
Our first Christmas here.

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:37.631
That... >> Our first Christmas here.
Yeah.

01:20:37.633 --> 01:20:38.933
Our first Christmas here. >> Yeah.
Wasn't fancy, but, you know, we.

01:20:38.935 --> 01:20:41.902
Yeah. Wasn't fancy, but,
you know, we made it work...

01:20:41.904 --> 01:20:45.272
Wasn't fancy, but, you know,
we made it work... Together.

01:20:45.274 --> 01:20:46.607
Made it work... Together.
No challenge, great or.

01:20:46.609 --> 01:20:48.275
Together. >> No challenge,
great or small...

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:50.411
No challenge, great or small...
will stop us.

01:20:50.413 --> 01:20:53.013
Small... >> ...will stop us.
We'll work through them all.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:57.017
Will stop us. We'll work through
them all. >> And find our way...

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:59.419
We'll work through them all. >>
And find our way... Together.

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:23.203
>> It's official.
We are divorced.

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:34.054
I guess you won't be needing that
anymore. You mind if I return it to my

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:34.655
that anymore. You mind if
I return it to my mother?

01:21:34.657 --> 01:21:35.522
You mind if I return it to my mother?
She's, uh...

01:21:35.524 --> 01:21:37.157
mother? She's, uh... She's
been asking about it.

01:21:37.159 --> 01:21:38.225
She's, uh... She's been asking about it.
It's a family heirloom.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:40.787
She's been asking about it. It's
a family heirloom. >> Of course.

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:52.973
Do what you got to do.
Regina Young is no more.

01:21:56.244 --> 01:22:04.244
Regina. >> I think I should go.
Please look at me.

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:23.304
I love you.

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:25.372
Regina Cartwright, only a fool

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:26.941
would let you go once.

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.575
Now, I promise you, I will never

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:32.813
make that same mistake twice.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:38.552
Will you marry me?

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.821
Again?

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.293
Baby, I got to hear you say

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:46.660
it.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.797
Yes, I will marry you again.

01:22:59.674 --> 01:23:01.442
We were technically divorced

01:23:01.576 --> 01:23:02.576
for one minute.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.912
Then we started all over again.

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.081
But that's another story for

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:09.450
another time on another

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:12.219
Christmas.
