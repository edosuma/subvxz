WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:04.620
Amy Taylor's son
got into Harvard.

00:04.620 --> 00:06.710
And Suzanna's son
got into Penn.

00:06.710 --> 00:09.420
Why haven't we heard back
from Junior's schools?

00:09.420 --> 00:12.000
I don't know.
That's because I opted
for paper mail

00:12.000 --> 00:14.170
instead of e-mail
for all of my notifications.

00:14.170 --> 00:15.580
Ooh, okay.

00:15.580 --> 00:18.170
What kind of weirdo
chooses snail mail?

00:18.170 --> 00:20.710
Sorry that I'm a romantic,

00:20.710 --> 00:23.710
but I wanted to do it the same
way that my ancestors did.

00:23.710 --> 00:25.670
Okay, well, your ancestors
didn't go to college.

00:25.670 --> 00:27.790
They were sold by
a college.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.330
Oh, God, Dre.
Okay?
Remember that.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.290
Oh.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.790
Howard University
has responded.

00:33.790 --> 00:35.080
My alma mater.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.330
Don't you mess this up.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.750
Um...how can you ruin
opening an envelope?

00:42.750 --> 00:44.000
You've seen the boy
open presents.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.710
♪♪

00:46.710 --> 00:49.290
Oh, my God.

00:49.290 --> 00:52.210
It's a baseball glove.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.830
And this is a bat.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.000
Let me see, boy.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Let's see what Howard
has to say.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.920
Okay, "Dear Andre J--

01:03.920 --> 01:05.670
You've been accepted
to Howard University

01:05.670 --> 01:08.040
on a full
academic scholarship"!

01:08.040 --> 01:10.210
Yes! And they gave us
a bumper sticker!

01:10.210 --> 01:12.210
Congratulations.
Open this one.

01:19.250 --> 01:20.210
What, what, what?

01:20.210 --> 01:21.540
Whoa.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.290
I got into Stanford.

01:23.290 --> 01:25.210
Wait, really?
What?

01:25.210 --> 01:28.000
Really.
I-I mean, of course you did,
sweetie!

01:28.000 --> 01:31.500
Well, sadly, the financial aid
isn't nearly as good.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.960
Oh.
Ah. Well, then,

01:32.960 --> 01:36.040
I guess there's obviously
only one choice.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.880
Yeah,
I guess you're right.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.000
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.500
We're going to Stanford!
We're going to Stanford!

01:43.500 --> 01:46.040
Whoo!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:46.040 --> 01:48.330
Sweetheart!
Oh, oh! Come on.

01:49.330 --> 01:50.670
What about Howard?

01:50.670 --> 01:51.920
Oh! Ah!

01:51.920 --> 01:53.000
Get that out of here.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.460
Okay, parentals, gotta run
and see what it takes

02:01.460 --> 02:03.040
to get into
the gluten

02:03.040 --> 02:04.920
Yes!
All right.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.380
Okay. Whoo!
This is so exciting!

02:07.380 --> 02:08.420
Yeah, it is, baby.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.170
Can't we at least
talk about this?

02:10.170 --> 02:12.170
Sweetie, he's been gluten-free
for like a month now.

02:12.170 --> 02:13.790
And -- And he thinks
it gives him more energy.

02:13.790 --> 02:15.830
Which is probably true.
I'm talking about us

02:15.830 --> 02:18.000
basically dismissing
a full ride from Howard

02:18.000 --> 02:19.380
like it's nothing.

02:19.380 --> 02:24.170
Yes, but he did get
into Stanford.

02:24.170 --> 02:25.880
Stanford.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.790
Mm-hmm, yes, but he also got
into Howard, all right?

02:29.790 --> 02:32.420
He could be a legacy kid
at my Zamunda.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.620
You mean the fake country
that Eddie Murphy left

02:35.620 --> 02:37.670
when he wanted to go
work at McDowell's?

02:37.670 --> 02:41.210
You watched it?
No, I-I read about it
on Wikipedia.

02:41.210 --> 02:43.380
You know I can't watch
Eriq La Salle.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.920
Babe.
What?

02:44.920 --> 02:46.880
Howard could be
Junior's Zamunda.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.420
I know, Dre, but he really
wants to go to Stanford.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.210
He loved it so much when
we went on the college tour.

02:52.210 --> 02:54.330
Okay, and how many historically
black universities

02:54.330 --> 02:56.290
did he visit on that tour?

02:56.290 --> 02:58.290
Uh, none. We didn't --
We didn't go to any.

02:58.290 --> 03:02.040
Yeah, this is what
I'm talking about, Bow.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.290
We are about to toss
Howard to the side

03:04.290 --> 03:06.620
because white people say
Stanford is a better school.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.250
White people
used to say that

03:08.250 --> 03:10.290
direct sunlight
was good for you.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.710
Now they walking around here
with parts of their nose gone.

03:12.710 --> 03:14.080
Okay.
White people

03:14.080 --> 03:15.460
don't always
get it right, Bow.

03:15.460 --> 03:20.170
Dre...this is not
a black and white issue.

03:20.170 --> 03:23.120
The boy spent his whole life
with white kids, Bow.

03:23.120 --> 03:27.250
This is his one shot
at a real blackening.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.710
Dre, I understand the importance
of Howard. I do.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.290
But the plan has always been
to get our kids

03:32.290 --> 03:34.080
into the best schools
possible

03:34.080 --> 03:36.500
so that they could have more
possibilities than we had.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.120
Maybe you're right.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.540
Of course I'm right.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.290
I wish you were the one
going away to college.

03:45.290 --> 03:48.290
I did have a really good time
during my college years.

03:48.290 --> 03:50.210
I went to school
with Diddy.

03:50.210 --> 03:51.710
I think his name
is Love now.

03:51.710 --> 03:54.290
His name is
Puff Daddy Diddy Love.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.620
Was it Sean when you guys
were in college?

03:56.620 --> 03:57.620
Dre: No!
Did you know him?

03:57.620 --> 03:59.040
I did.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.120
So, not sure if everyone
heard the big news,

04:03.120 --> 04:05.920
but I got into Stanford.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.290
Oh, my gosh!
Congratulations.
Oh, congratulations,
baby!

04:09.290 --> 04:11.420
You know I always knew

04:11.420 --> 04:14.380
not being popular
was gonna pay off for you.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.830
Thanks, Grandma.

04:15.830 --> 04:17.670
That feeling when
your older brother's

04:17.670 --> 04:19.540
finally leaving home
for good?

04:23.670 --> 04:25.920
That's funny.
That's a good one, Jack.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.710
Well played, buddy.

04:27.710 --> 04:30.960
You are really starting
to discover your comedic voice.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.670
Is he?

04:32.670 --> 04:35.790
I mean, everyone knows that
I'm the funny one. Like...

04:35.790 --> 04:38.040
Jealous sister
got me like...

04:41.540 --> 04:43.830
Got me like...

04:43.830 --> 04:46.210
Now that's funny.

04:46.210 --> 04:48.080
Are you guys serious?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.960
He's just doing stupid memes
that he saw online.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.710
Don't you see it?

04:52.710 --> 04:55.500
Diane, baby,
don't be so bitter.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.670
The laughs were undeniable.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.120
Uh, #Mood.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.750
Hey, look at this!

05:04.960 --> 05:06.750
Stevens: Okay, gang.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.790
I need pitches
on a new account

05:08.790 --> 05:12.420
for this energy drink
called Savagery.

05:12.420 --> 05:16.120
One small note -- side effects
include liver palpitations.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.880
Go!
Uh, okay.

05:17.880 --> 05:23.380
"Savagery -- for when you need
your liver to palpitate."

05:23.380 --> 05:25.750
Great pitch, pumpkin.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.500
Going straight
at the problem.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.750
Now, remember,
we're trying to get this product

05:29.750 --> 05:31.210
into elementary schools.

05:31.210 --> 05:32.670
Charlie,
what do you got?

05:32.670 --> 05:34.210
Uh, "Savagery --

05:34.210 --> 05:36.580
don't worry,
you got two livers."

05:36.580 --> 05:39.380
Outstanding.
Kids are hilariously trusting.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.880
Dre.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.830
My family is stupid.

05:42.830 --> 05:45.290
No one wants Junior
to go to Howard,

05:45.290 --> 05:47.080
even though he got
a full scholarship.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.620
FYI -- it's pronounced
Harvard.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.330
Why wouldn't they want Junior
to go to Harvard?

05:52.330 --> 05:54.170
T-That's where I went,
by the way.

05:54.170 --> 05:55.670
Not sure if
I told you yet.

05:55.670 --> 05:58.880
Actually, gentlemen, I believe
Dre is saying "Howard"...

05:58.880 --> 06:00.420
Yes.
...like the duck.

06:00.420 --> 06:04.540
No, the historically black
college where I went to school.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.880
I could swear that you told me
that you went to Harvard

06:07.880 --> 06:09.420
when I interviewed you.
No.

06:09.420 --> 06:10.920
I mean, not that
I wouldn't have hired you

06:10.920 --> 06:14.330
if I had known that you went
to some school for blacks

06:14.330 --> 06:17.330
that obviously white people
abandon. I mean --

06:17.330 --> 06:20.330
I don't understand. If you guys
can go to our normal colleges,

06:20.330 --> 06:21.500
then why do you
need your own?

06:21.500 --> 06:23.040
Yeah.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.120
Because we weren't
always allowed

06:25.120 --> 06:27.580
into your "normal" colleges.

06:27.580 --> 06:29.250
Do you have any idea

06:29.250 --> 06:32.330
how many successful black
Americans went to HBCUs?

06:32.960 --> 06:36.420
MLK, Spike Lee, Diddy,

06:36.420 --> 06:39.170
Ta-Nehisi Coates,
Kamala Harris, Oprah.

06:39.170 --> 06:43.040
My cousin Raymar, Delvon,
and Lil Big Man, too.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.330
They all did a semester
at Grambling State

06:45.330 --> 06:47.330
before hitting it big
in the copper industry.

06:47.330 --> 06:49.120
I didn't know your cousins
were copper miners.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.120
Copper sellers,
actually.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.580
You know,
when people move,

06:52.580 --> 06:54.250
they leave copper pipes
laying around in their walls,

06:54.250 --> 06:56.710
like they just got money
like that, you know?

06:56.710 --> 06:59.000
Oprah and I would not be
where we are today

06:59.000 --> 07:00.380
had it not been
for black colleges.
Facts.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.710
And we're all sitting around
the same table

07:02.710 --> 07:05.500
doing the same work
and getting equal pay.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.960
Except you're not exactly
getting equal --

07:06.960 --> 07:07.920
Uh-uh-uh.
What?

07:07.920 --> 07:09.670
Bumpkin, no, no.
What?

07:10.960 --> 07:12.290
Oh, my God!
It's lunchtime.

07:12.290 --> 07:14.290
What
I just -- I --

07:14.290 --> 07:16.540
-Gotta go. Gotta go!
-Sushi truck!

07:16.540 --> 07:18.080
♪♪

07:18.080 --> 07:19.960
Didn't we
just get to work?

07:19.960 --> 07:21.380
Yeah, they doing
something to us.

07:21.380 --> 07:23.170
When they all go
eat together,

07:23.170 --> 07:24.670
that's when we should
get nervous.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.000
Ruby: Action!

07:28.000 --> 07:29.330
Steppin' into the weekend
like...

07:31.120 --> 07:32.210
All right.
No, no, no, no, no.

07:32.210 --> 07:33.710
Cut! Cut!

07:33.710 --> 07:37.120
This time, I want you
to really make me believe

07:37.120 --> 07:38.960
that you're goin'
into the weekend!

07:38.960 --> 07:40.620
Like you say you are.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.040
Okay.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.000
Steppin' into the weekend
like...

07:45.000 --> 07:47.170
Yeah, that's it, baby!
Ha-ha!

07:47.170 --> 07:48.500
That's Grandma's baby.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.000
Seriously, guys?

07:51.500 --> 07:54.170
Jack is not funny.
Are we still on this?

07:54.170 --> 07:56.420
Well, not only
are we still on this,

07:56.420 --> 07:59.420
but Grandma's decided
to come out of retirement

07:59.420 --> 08:01.670
and help manage
Jack's career.

08:01.670 --> 08:04.880
You know, I used to work
with Sinbad. Hey!

08:04.880 --> 08:06.250
Actually, Grandma,

08:06.250 --> 08:07.670
I've been thinking
about dabbling

08:07.670 --> 08:09.670
in the entertainment industry
myself.

08:09.670 --> 08:12.420
Maybe you can take me on
as a client, too, like...

08:12.420 --> 08:16.120
Oh, Diane.
Sweetie, I don't think so.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.210
You know, family
and show business

08:19.210 --> 08:21.250
just don't mix.
Mm.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.750
But you literally just said
you're managing Jack.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.250
Well, yeah, I guess I did say
that.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.880
All right, sweetie,
fine.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.540
But before we sign
any paperwork,

08:30.540 --> 08:34.000
you should know I, uh

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I never worked with Sinbad.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.540
♪♪

08:39.540 --> 08:41.880
Mm.
Pack your bags.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.380
Because we are going to
take a trip to Zamunda

08:44.380 --> 08:46.000
whether your mother likes it
or not.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.170
Actually, I think
that's a great idea.

08:52.540 --> 08:53.960
Hey, guys.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.210
Hey.
Hey, sweetie.

08:55.210 --> 08:57.290
Can you take a look
at my luggage

08:57.290 --> 09:00.040
to make sure I packed
appropriately?

09:00.040 --> 09:03.080
Considering Howard
is so far from home,

09:03.080 --> 09:05.460
with so many
unknown variables...

09:05.460 --> 09:07.670
What the hell is this, huh?
AC/DC?
What?

Mom, please get him
to drop Howard.

09:27.580 --> 09:30.120
Junior, you know that the more

I had a really
hard time

19:26.580 --> 19:29.420
returning to the white world
after school.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.880
And I'm worried that you
won't hear "Alison" at Howard

19:34.880 --> 19:37.670
and people are gonna give you
a hard time for that.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.290
The Elvis Costello song?

19:39.290 --> 19:41.170
You know that?
Of course.

19:41.170 --> 19:43.380
It's a beautiful song,
actually.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.580
Maybe I could be
the black kid

19:45.580 --> 19:49.830
who introduces other black kids
at Howard to Elvis Costello.

19:49.830 --> 19:52.920
That way, they don't
have to go through what
you went through, Dad.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.670
But...I bet you

19:55.670 --> 20:00.380
that there are plenty
of girls at Stanford

20:00.380 --> 20:03.710
who would happily
punch you in the face.

20:03.710 --> 20:05.210
They would love
to do that.

20:05.210 --> 20:06.420
You sound desperate.
That's -- N--

20:06.420 --> 20:08.000
You know what, son?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.080
The next time
we fly to Howard,

20:10.080 --> 20:12.380
I'll make sure
we have two seats

20:12.380 --> 20:13.750
next to each other
on the plane.

20:13.750 --> 20:16.120
♪♪

20:16.120 --> 20:17.580
HU!

20:17.580 --> 20:19.330
You know!

20:19.330 --> 20:22.580
You are a legacy kid, son!

20:22.580 --> 20:24.710
Bow!
He's a legacy kid.

20:24.710 --> 20:25.460
Yep.
Mm-hmm.

20:29.620 --> 20:30.710
You know what I hate?

20:30.710 --> 20:32.120
When you're finally
early to class

20:32.120 --> 20:34.170
but that's the one day
your teacher's running late.

20:34.170 --> 20:36.750
Chomp-chomp-chicken!

20:36.750 --> 20:39.380
The other day, I sat down
and watched the game,

20:39.380 --> 20:43.120
but I realized I recorded
the Spanish version.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.330
Chomp-chomp-chicken!

20:45.330 --> 20:48.380
Oh, God, I hate myself.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.040
Eh.
You get used to it.

20:51.420 --> 20:55.000
What?
She's just sayin'. Hey!

20:56.380 --> 20:57.290
I'm just sayin'.
