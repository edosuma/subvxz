00:12.000 --> 00:15.542
- Penzel stopped paying
your taxes four years ago.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.417
- Bullshit.
I signed the returns.

00:17.417 --> 00:20.333
I signed the checks.
- Then he shredded the returns,

00:20.333 --> 00:21.417
cashed the checks,

00:21.417 --> 00:22.834
and took the money.

00:22.834 --> 00:24.875
I've been on with the IRS
all morning.

00:24.875 --> 00:27.834
- How much?
- 7.9 million.

00:27.834 --> 00:29.500
- Jesus.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.750
- I thought I sensed a certain--

00:32.750 --> 00:34.625
between you and Helen.

00:34.625 --> 00:37.959
- Mm-hmm.
- And the--

00:37.959 --> 00:40.250
[mumbling] part?

00:40.250 --> 00:44.000
- Oh, well, obviously I've never
seen one that close before.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.500
- Obviously.
- I thought it'd be

00:45.500 --> 00:47.250
a little weird,

00:47.250 --> 00:51.834
but once you get down there,
it's like, "Oh, I know you."

01:42.083 --> 01:45.208
- I feel like
I haven't seen you in ages.

01:45.208 --> 01:46.709
- I know. It's crazy.

01:46.709 --> 01:48.125
I haven't seen anybody.

01:48.125 --> 01:50.375
- So this thing
with Helen is still--

01:50.375 --> 01:53.667
- Oh, my God, we are together
literally, literally,

01:53.667 --> 01:55.333
literally--
- Only need one.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.375
- Literally 24-7.

01:57.375 --> 02:01.500
I can't remember the last time
I slept in my own bed.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.041
The only reason I'm here now
is she had some breakfast thing.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.792
- Aww, flattering.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.625
- Hey, what can I say?

02:07.625 --> 02:10.917
[French accent]
Ze woman is into me.

02:10.917 --> 02:13.917
[normal voice] Oh, and yes,
she still likes my voices.

02:13.917 --> 02:15.875
- Well, that makes no sense.

02:15.875 --> 02:19.542
- Oh, and...la, la, la.
There.

02:19.542 --> 02:20.542
- Oh, pretty.

02:20.542 --> 02:22.542
- Isn't it?

02:22.542 --> 02:23.917
She got us matching ones.

02:23.917 --> 02:24.917
- Matching?

02:24.917 --> 02:26.917
After two weeks?

02:26.917 --> 02:29.834
- Actually,
she gave it to me last week.

02:29.834 --> 02:34.208
- Aww. You're one link
away from a chain gang.

02:34.208 --> 02:37.750
- Okay, fine,
she's a little intense.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.333
But I'd rather
have that than some guy

02:40.333 --> 02:43.583
who doesn't even invite me
to his son's bar mitzvah

02:43.583 --> 02:47.041
but wants me to blow him
in his wife's wedding dress.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.000
- Merc?
- Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.458
- Were you in the dress,
or was he in the dress?

02:50.458 --> 02:52.959
- I was in the dress.
- Oh, I wasn't clear.

02:52.959 --> 02:54.542
Look, as long as you're happy.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.875
- Of course I'm happy.

02:56.875 --> 03:00.291
Right?

03:02.500 --> 03:07.750
Anyway, I'm here with you
now, yeah?

03:07.750 --> 03:08.959
So talk to me.

03:08.959 --> 03:10.291
- Well, thankfully our
nightmare...

03:10.291 --> 03:11.333
[phone ringing]

03:11.333 --> 03:12.667
with Tim is final--

03:12.667 --> 03:16.875
- Hello?
What do you mean she canceled?

03:16.875 --> 03:19.625
It's Helen.
- Mmm.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.750
- That's bullshit.

03:21.750 --> 03:25.834
Please, she has, like,
18 nannies for that.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.834
She said that to you?

03:31.834 --> 03:34.834
What did you say?

03:34.834 --> 03:36.417
You did not.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.166
I love it.
- [mocking] I love it.

03:38.166 --> 03:41.917
- That's perfect.
- [mocking] That's perfect.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.250
- Wait, shit.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.166
I think I lost you.
Hello?

03:45.166 --> 03:46.542
Hello?

03:46.542 --> 03:49.291
Oh, okay, I'm hanging up now.

03:49.291 --> 03:51.000
B-bye.
- Oh, my God.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.333
- I'm so sorry.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.500
I just couldn't get off.
- No, of course not.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.041
If only they'd invent a little
button that ends a call.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.875
- Just let me
quickly call her back.

03:58.875 --> 04:00.667
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

04:00.667 --> 04:03.208
So she knows I didn't fall off
a cliff or something.

04:03.208 --> 04:04.583
- Or get pushed off.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.667
- Hello?

04:06.667 --> 04:08.834
I know.
I lost you.

04:08.834 --> 04:10.000
Sorry.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.792
Is this better?

04:11.792 --> 04:14.458
Hello?
Oh, shoot.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.291
I-I'm losing you again.

04:16.291 --> 04:20.792
D-don't hang up.
[whistles]

04:20.792 --> 04:22.542
This better?

04:22.542 --> 04:24.500
Oh, okay, okay.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.625
Say it again?

04:27.625 --> 04:28.959
Exactly.

04:28.959 --> 04:32.041
Well, she's her own worst enemy.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.500
- Hey, you guys.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.375
- Morning, Morning.
- Hello.

04:38.375 --> 04:42.083
- I have been hearing such great
things about your new show.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.250
- Have you?
- Oh, that's so nice.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.000
- Word around town?
Ah-ma-zing.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.291
- Well, I don't know about that.
- Still lots of work to do.

04:48.291 --> 04:51.750
- I'm just so happy
for you guys, seriously.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.625
After going through something
like this, you so deserve

04:54.625 --> 04:56.500
something like that.
- Thank you.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.083
- Oh, that's very kind.
- I haven't read it yet,

04:58.083 --> 05:00.709
but I heard everyone
gets to play two parts?

05:00.709 --> 05:02.083
- That's the concept.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.125
- Brilliant, brilliant.

05:04.125 --> 05:07.083
And what a gift to those actors.

05:09.875 --> 05:13.625
- Just so you know,

05:13.625 --> 05:15.250
it's not
that we didn't think of you,

05:15.250 --> 05:16.917
but unfortunately,

05:16.917 --> 05:18.667
there's really nothing
that you'd be right for.

05:18.667 --> 05:20.333
- We wish there were, but--

05:20.333 --> 05:22.834
- Oh, my God, you guys,
I so didn't even go there.

05:22.834 --> 05:24.917
Stop it, no.

05:24.917 --> 05:26.917
- Well, we wanted you to know.
- Stop, please.

05:26.917 --> 05:28.917
I just came over
to say congrats.

05:28.917 --> 05:30.667
And by the way,

05:30.667 --> 05:33.500
the last thing I need right now
is another show, ugh.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.208
I've got my sister's wedding
coming up,

05:35.208 --> 05:37.500
and that's a--
a whole other nightmare.

05:37.500 --> 05:41.875
She's in a chair,
so just figuring out the ramps--

05:43.625 --> 05:48.667
So I've got that and--oh.

05:48.667 --> 05:54.291
- Well, congratulations, um,
to your sister.

05:54.291 --> 05:57.625
- And as far as me not being
right for your thing, I get it.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.500
Hello?
Makes total sense.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.125
Of course, you really
only know me from this,

06:03.125 --> 06:05.000
which is hardly the most--

06:05.000 --> 06:07.458
But hey, I did my best here.

06:07.458 --> 06:10.041
I don't make up the words.

06:10.041 --> 06:11.583
But it's fine, really.

06:11.583 --> 06:12.750
It's your show.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.125
You know what you want.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.625
Who am I to tell you?

06:15.625 --> 06:19.333
Come on, you're the geniuses
behind Pucks!

06:19.333 --> 06:21.709
- Right, well...
- I just think it's fantastic

06:21.709 --> 06:23.625
they're even letting you do it.

06:23.625 --> 06:25.750
I mean, after this, nobody's
like, "You stunk up the joint.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.083
Get out."

06:27.083 --> 06:29.542
And with such a risky concept.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.125
Everybody plays two parts?

06:31.125 --> 06:33.709
Yeah, that won't get tired fast.

06:33.709 --> 06:36.417
I'm totally kidding.

06:36.417 --> 06:40.500
You know I only wish you
good things.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.041
- We know you do.

06:42.041 --> 06:45.000
- Now go get 'em.
Go, go, go.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.750
[under breath]
Or go fuck yourselves.

06:47.750 --> 06:51.000
- She might have got a little
further away before she said it.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.208
- Mmm.

06:52.208 --> 06:55.166
- Hey.
- Bite me.

06:55.166 --> 06:59.208
[phone ringing]

06:59.208 --> 07:01.083
- Ugh.

07:01.083 --> 07:03.041
Yo.
- It's Bob.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.750
- The two words
I dread the most.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.250
- Just doing my job.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.917
So we've got to talk
about this IRS thing.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.834
8 million isn't going away.

07:10.834 --> 07:12.000
- What happened to 7.9?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.166
- That was last week.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.417
It's called interest.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.208
- Oh, Jesus.

07:16.208 --> 07:17.667
So what do I do?

07:17.667 --> 07:19.542
- You do what I've been
saying you should do.

07:19.542 --> 07:20.959
- What, the plane?

07:20.959 --> 07:22.208
- It's time.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.583
- I know I don't need a plane.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.041
- Did he really just say that?

07:26.041 --> 07:27.542
- But there's got
to be some other way.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.500
- I'm telling you there's not.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.250
Even that's not gonna
cover it all.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.667
- Seriously?

07:32.667 --> 07:34.041
It's a plane.

07:34.041 --> 07:36.000
- 8 million.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.208
We've got to look at the car
collection, your father's condo,

07:39.208 --> 07:40.500
maybe the beach house.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.250
- Well, how much would I save
if I fired you?

07:43.250 --> 07:44.834
[phone beeping]

07:44.834 --> 07:48.166
I got another call.

07:48.166 --> 07:49.458
Yo.
- He's dying.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.500
- Who's dying?
- Who do you think?

07:51.500 --> 07:54.250
- All right, cal--calm down.
What happened?

07:54.250 --> 07:55.917
- It's his heart.
- Is it bad?

07:55.917 --> 07:58.625
- No, I'm calling to say
his heart is good.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.083
- All right.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.750
Where are you?

08:01.750 --> 08:03.917
I'm on my way.
- What's wrong?

08:03.917 --> 08:07.041
- My father's had some kind
of heart attack.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.250
I got to go.
- No way. A pity.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.000
- I'm so sorry.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.250
- I got a family emergency.
I'm gonna have to take off.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.208
- Should we offer
to go with him?

08:13.208 --> 08:15.417
- No. No.
- What?

08:15.417 --> 08:19.166
- Uh, I was just saying
if you want,

08:19.166 --> 08:21.000
we're happy to go with you.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.458
- That'd be great.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.542
- [mouths word]

08:27.542 --> 08:30.250
- It's a sandwich,
for Christ's sake.

08:30.250 --> 08:31.583
- They said not to eat.

08:31.583 --> 08:32.709
- Then why'd they give me
a menu?

08:32.709 --> 08:34.625
- What do I look like, a doctor?

08:34.625 --> 08:36.875
- Get me a goddamn sandwich.
- What?

08:36.875 --> 08:38.542
- They said
you can have ice chips.

08:38.542 --> 08:39.917
Here.
Suck these.

08:39.917 --> 08:41.125
- You suck 'em.

08:41.125 --> 08:42.458
- You said he was dying.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.750
- I will if I don't get
a sandwich.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.125
- He looks okay to me.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.125
- Oh, what, so now
you're a doctor?

08:48.125 --> 08:49.208
- I'm fine.

08:49.208 --> 08:50.667
- You're not fine.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.041
I am telling you
he's gonna leave here in a box.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.500
- Jesus.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.291
- Maybe we should wait
in the hall.

08:56.291 --> 08:57.875
- Who are they?

08:57.875 --> 09:00.208
- We've actually met.
Sean and Beverly Lincoln.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.375
- They're my writers.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.583
- What the hell
do you need writers for?

09:02.583 --> 09:04.125
You're in a hospital.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.834
- We're here for support.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.583
- So far you're doing great.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.667
- So what the hell happened?

09:09.667 --> 09:11.125
- He collapsed over breakfast.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.208
That's what happened.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.583
- "Collapsed."

09:13.583 --> 09:15.542
- Well, what do you call it?

09:15.542 --> 09:17.333
His face was down
in his cream of wheat.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.208
They had to rush him here
in an ambulance.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.417
- Ooh, when I get out of here,

09:20.417 --> 09:21.917
I'm gonna get one
of those sirens.

09:21.917 --> 09:24.333
From the condo to here,
ten minutes.

09:24.333 --> 09:26.291
- Yeah,
so what did the doctor say?

09:26.291 --> 09:27.583
- He ran a bunch of tests.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.166
We're waiting to hear.

09:29.166 --> 09:31.834
- More important, you've got
to get us a better room.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.000
- What's wrong with this one?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.291
- You want to look
at that all day?

09:36.291 --> 09:39.375
- H-hello.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.959
- Whatever he has,
I don't want it.

09:42.959 --> 09:47.583
- Perhaps I'll just...
give you a little privacy.

09:49.291 --> 09:50.583
There we go.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.208
- You're the big shot.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.375
Use your clout.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.875
- Yeah, talk to somebody.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.208
- What am I supposed to say?

09:56.208 --> 10:00.000
- Why don't you ask
your writers?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.750
- Fine, I'll see what I can do.

10:11.417 --> 10:13.625
- So it's lovely
to see you both again.

10:13.625 --> 10:16.166
I just wish it were
under better circumstances.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.291
- You don't have to talk.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.750
- All right.

10:24.834 --> 10:28.166
- So? Huh?
Happy now?

10:28.166 --> 10:32.333
- What do you want, a parade?

10:32.333 --> 10:33.750
- Here we go.
Comfy?

10:33.750 --> 10:34.917
- That's perfect.

10:34.917 --> 10:37.250
Thank you, darling.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.583
You are wonderful.

10:38.583 --> 10:40.500
You're my guardian angel.

10:40.500 --> 10:44.083
- You are a gift
from God.

10:48.917 --> 10:52.291
Hide your watch.

10:52.291 --> 10:55.583
- By the way, I told her
we'd get her a Friends  picture.

10:55.583 --> 10:56.959
- Oh, we're gonna need a bunch.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.417
Now they all want one.

10:58.417 --> 11:01.125
- Fine.
I've got some in my car.

11:01.125 --> 11:04.041
- You keep Friends  pictures
in your car?

11:04.041 --> 11:06.041
- Judging?
Really? Now?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.792
- Oh, and autographed.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.083
- Relax.

11:09.083 --> 11:10.291
I already signed them.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.417
- What about the other five?
- What?

11:12.417 --> 11:14.375
- No one wants just you.

11:14.375 --> 11:17.208
Jesus, the ego.
Ha!

11:17.208 --> 11:20.291
- Fuck me.

11:20.291 --> 11:21.959
Come on.

11:21.959 --> 11:24.625
- What do you need us for?
- You want to stay here?

11:24.625 --> 11:26.709
- Right, good point.
- Right behind you.

11:34.250 --> 11:37.166
Take a look.
I did two different Jennifers.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.000
This one's just a scrawl like,

11:39.000 --> 11:40.041
"I'm a big star.

11:40.041 --> 11:41.792
I don't have time to sign."

11:41.792 --> 11:44.125
Or this one,

11:44.125 --> 11:46.291
"Even though
I am Jennifer Aniston,

11:46.291 --> 11:48.625
"I take the time
to carefully write my name

11:48.625 --> 11:53.458
so you can read every letter."

11:53.458 --> 11:54.583
Which do you think?

11:54.583 --> 11:57.834
- Mmm...
I don't care.

12:00.667 --> 12:05.291
- You know what's killing him,
don't you?

12:05.291 --> 12:06.750
- No, what?

12:06.750 --> 12:07.792
- You.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.417
You're what's killing him.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.667
- Not the smoking for 70 years?

12:11.667 --> 12:13.834
- All I know is
he was doing fine

12:13.834 --> 12:16.166
till he read about you
and your money.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.500
That's when the chest pains
started.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.291
- He never said anything to me.

12:20.291 --> 12:21.458
- Of course not.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.375
He's got pride.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.333
- He's got no pride.

12:25.333 --> 12:29.083
- You talking about me?

12:29.083 --> 12:30.208
- Mr. LeBlanc.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.250
I'm Dr. Lillian.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.375
How are we feeling?

12:32.375 --> 12:33.500
- I'm feeling hungry.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.375
How are you feeling?

12:35.375 --> 12:36.917
- Hey, doc, I'm Matt.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.542
- Yes, I know. My wife's going
to be very jealous.

12:38.542 --> 12:41.250
- I'm serious, a cracker,
anything.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.375
- So where are we?

12:42.375 --> 12:44.083
- Well,
I wish we had better news.

12:44.083 --> 12:46.917
There's definitely evidence
of severe arterial blockage.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.291
- I knew it.

12:48.291 --> 12:49.750
- I'm recommending
we perform a bypass.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.709
It'll increase the flow of blood
to his heart.

12:51.709 --> 12:52.834
- What number?

12:52.834 --> 12:55.375
Double? Triple?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.458
- You hit the jackpot,
quadruple.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.542
- Jesus.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.834
- Doctor, may I ask,
where did you study?

13:01.834 --> 13:03.542
- University of Manitoba.

13:03.542 --> 13:07.333
- Oh, Manitoba.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.875
- So here's the plan.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.458
We're trying
to schedule you in for today.

13:10.458 --> 13:11.875
I think it best not to wait.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.458
I'll let you know as soon
as I hear anything.

13:13.458 --> 13:14.875
- Okay, thanks, doctor.
- Thank you so much.

13:14.875 --> 13:15.959
- Thank you, doctor.
See you later.

13:15.959 --> 13:17.375
Goodbye.
- Nice to meet you, yes.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.667
- God bless you.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.792
Manitoba ain't cracking me open.

13:24.542 --> 13:25.875
- What's happening?

13:25.875 --> 13:27.417
- Hey.
He's got to have surgery.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.166
- Oh, you're kidding.
- So sorry.

13:29.166 --> 13:30.917
- Quadruple bypass.

13:30.917 --> 13:33.083
And of course, now I have
to find him a better surgeon.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.917
- What's wrong with the one
they've got?

13:34.917 --> 13:36.667
- It's the one they've got.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.542
I don't even know
where to fucking start.

13:38.542 --> 13:41.417
- What about your father?
Maybe he can recommend someone.

13:41.417 --> 13:42.375
- Oh, right.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.417
What kind of doctor is he?

13:44.417 --> 13:45.959
- Cardiac surgeon.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.250
- He's one of the top guys
in London.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.792
- Thank you.
- Well, he is.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.750
- Great. Call him.
See who he likes.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.709
- Actually, as Bev knows,

13:52.709 --> 13:55.125
I'm extremely uncomfortable
asking my father for anything.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.750
- Oh, that's fine, you
don't have to be comfortable.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.125
Just ask him.

14:01.709 --> 14:04.250
- Shh. He's resting.
- Okay.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.125
- So listen.

14:06.125 --> 14:09.959
While I've got you, I'm sure
everything is going to be okay,

14:09.959 --> 14:13.583
and dad is going to come through
with flying colors.

14:13.583 --> 14:16.542
- Uh-huh.
- But in the unlikely event

14:16.542 --> 14:20.125
he doesn't, hypothetically,

14:20.125 --> 14:22.458
what the fuck happens to me?

14:22.458 --> 14:25.166
- What?
- Well, I have no protection,

14:25.166 --> 14:26.834
nothing in my name.

14:26.834 --> 14:30.333
I need to know when he's dead
I am not out on my ass.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.542
- I can hear you!

14:31.542 --> 14:34.125
- Rest, God damn it!

14:34.125 --> 14:35.333
I want the condo.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.000
- You're not getting the condo.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.667
- What do you need it for?

14:38.667 --> 14:40.458
- 'Cause he's got no money.
- I'm t--

14:40.458 --> 14:42.083
- Excuse me, folks,
I'm gonna

14:42.083 --> 14:43.458
have to ask you to take
this conversation elsewhere.

14:43.458 --> 14:44.667
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.250
- Sorry.

14:46.250 --> 14:49.125
- I've been taking care
of this man for 14 years.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.041
I cook for him.

14:50.041 --> 14:51.667
I clean for him.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.583
You know I have to shake
his pecker every time he pees?

14:54.583 --> 14:56.750
- That's just 'cause I like it.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.500
- I do all of that,

14:58.500 --> 14:59.959
and you're just gonna
throw me out with the garbage?

14:59.959 --> 15:01.208
- Hey, don't give me
that guilt shit.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.667
You're not my mother.

15:02.667 --> 15:05.417
- You ungrateful prick.

15:05.417 --> 15:07.166
Say something.

15:07.166 --> 15:10.083
- You know, I might not die.

15:10.083 --> 15:13.667
- We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.709
[phone ringing]

15:20.709 --> 15:22.500
- This is Dr. Lincoln.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.542
- Dad?

15:23.542 --> 15:26.083
- Yes?

15:26.083 --> 15:27.625
- It's Sean.

15:27.625 --> 15:30.125
- Yes?

15:30.125 --> 15:31.875
- So how have you been?

15:31.875 --> 15:36.834
- Fine.

15:36.834 --> 15:39.959
- I'm fine as well.
- Ah.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.917
- So I was actually calling
for some medical advice.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.709
- Oh.
- I need the name

15:44.709 --> 15:47.500
of a top cardiac surgeon
in L.A..

15:47.500 --> 15:48.959
- For whom?

15:48.959 --> 15:51.625
- Matt LeBlanc's father.
- Who?

15:51.625 --> 15:55.208
- Matt LeBlanc,
the star of our show.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.000
- Never watched it.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.083
- Right, anyway, I was wondering
if you could recommend someone.

16:00.083 --> 16:02.458
His father
needs a quadruple bypass.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.959
- Anyone can do that.

16:03.959 --> 16:05.750
- Yes, but they want the best.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.959
- You don't need the best
for that.

16:07.959 --> 16:12.041
- Still, I'm making this call
as a favor.

16:12.041 --> 16:16.542
If you could just
give me a name, humor me.

16:16.542 --> 16:20.458
- Oh, well,
Krosnik thinks he's the best.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.291
He's not.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.375
- So who is?

16:23.375 --> 16:26.417
- Ganverman's not great.
- Okay.

16:26.417 --> 16:28.166
- Perlmutter used
to be pretty good,

16:28.166 --> 16:31.709
but now he's
all about his stupid book.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.083
- Just need a name.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.542
- Well, I just gave you three.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.583
- None of whom you recommend.

16:36.583 --> 16:39.542
- I'll say.

16:39.542 --> 16:44.250
- Doctor Forrest,
dial 1-8-2, please.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.166
- Hello?
- Hi, honey.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.917
You sound like you're
at the airport.

16:47.917 --> 16:49.333
- If only.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.792
I'm actually at the hospital.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.583
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

16:52.583 --> 16:54.166
- I'm fine.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.291
Matt LeBlanc's father
has to have heart surgery.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.375
- And you're there why?

16:58.375 --> 17:00.125
- You tell me.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.500
You don't happen to know
a good heart surgeon, do you?

17:02.500 --> 17:05.250
- Ooh, he should get the guy
who did Merc.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.625
- I didn't know
Merc had a heart.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.875
- Heh!
Supposedly he's the best.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.417
He did Larry King.

17:12.417 --> 17:15.083
He did most
of the Golden Girls.

17:15.083 --> 17:17.291
And then I think he
did Larry King again.

17:17.291 --> 17:19.458
- Hmm. Do you have a name?

17:19.458 --> 17:21.583
- Dr. Something.
I don't know.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.834
Just have Matt call Merc.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.000
He can get him in.
- Great.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.667
- So, uh, I kind
of have an emergency.

17:29.667 --> 17:30.834
- Okay.

17:30.834 --> 17:33.583
- I need a pet name for Helen.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.792
- Right.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.250
I think I heard about this
on CNN.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.667
- Seriously.

17:38.667 --> 17:41.166
It needs to be
sweet and loving,

17:41.166 --> 17:42.709
and I need it fast.

17:42.709 --> 17:44.667
- And why do you have
to give her one?

17:44.667 --> 17:46.083
- 'Cause she gave me one.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.667
- Really? Pet names already?

17:48.667 --> 17:50.625
- I know.

17:50.625 --> 17:53.875
It's like we're on some kind
of accelerated lesbian calendar.

17:53.875 --> 17:56.500
Like, three days is a week.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.041
If I were a dog,
I'd be dead by now.

17:59.041 --> 18:03.500
- Well, what does she call you?

18:03.500 --> 18:07.208
- Scrunchie.
- Scrunchie?

18:07.208 --> 18:09.208
[laughing]
Where did she get Scrunchie?

18:09.208 --> 18:11.792
- Because I wear
this stupid scrunchie

18:11.792 --> 18:14.709
when I wash my face at night.

18:14.709 --> 18:15.959
I'm her Scrunchie.

18:15.959 --> 18:17.125
- Aww.

18:17.125 --> 18:19.625
- I know.
It's cute, right?

18:19.625 --> 18:21.041
That's where the bar is.

18:21.041 --> 18:22.875
- Okay, calm down.

18:22.875 --> 18:26.041
- Everything I try out
in my head sounds stupid.

18:26.041 --> 18:28.834
Just give me something,
anything.

18:28.834 --> 18:29.917
- That's not how it works.

18:29.917 --> 18:33.625
It's got to evolve
out of a moment.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.458
It's got to be organic and--

18:35.458 --> 18:38.583
and playful and something
that connects you two.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.750
- Ugh!
You're no use to me.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.542
Maybe there's a website
or something.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.458
- Did you speak to him?
- Oh.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.333
It's like playing chess
with Death if Death were cranky.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.792
- So? What did he say?

18:52.792 --> 18:54.792
- He gave me the name
of three doctors

18:54.792 --> 18:56.917
he firmly doesn't recommend.

18:56.917 --> 18:59.166
- However, according to Carol,

18:59.166 --> 19:01.834
Merc Lapidus
used the top guy in L.A..

19:01.834 --> 19:03.792
She said to call Merc,
and he can get you in.

19:03.792 --> 19:05.834
- Yeah, that's not happening.
- What?

19:05.834 --> 19:07.417
- I'm not talking
to that asshole.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.000
- But you made me
call my father.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.500
- Is he an asshole?
- Yes!

19:10.500 --> 19:12.166
- Really? Well, you should
have said something.

19:12.166 --> 19:13.291
- Ugh.

19:13.291 --> 19:17.000
- So what about finding
a doctor?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.792
- Screw it.
We'll go with Manitoba.

19:18.792 --> 19:22.583
It's all a crapshoot anyway.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.709
- I'm still not talking to you.

19:26.709 --> 19:29.875
- And I'm still grateful.
- Come here.

19:29.875 --> 19:30.917
- What's going on?

19:30.917 --> 19:32.125
- She's prepping me.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.041
- Whoa.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.875
- Oh, relax, Mary.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.959
Where do you think
you came from?

19:36.959 --> 19:39.709
Sweetheart, while you're
down there, maybe get the balls?

19:39.709 --> 19:40.834
- There's no reason, sir.

19:40.834 --> 19:43.125
- Who needs a reason?

19:43.125 --> 19:45.208
Anyways, this thing
with you and Linda.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.041
Why're you making it so hard?

19:47.041 --> 19:48.917
Just tell her you'll take care
of her.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.917
- Yeah, but I'm not.

19:50.917 --> 19:52.125
- Who gives a shit?

19:52.125 --> 19:54.792
I'll be dead.
Just get her off my back.

19:54.792 --> 19:56.000
I don't need this now.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.375
- What,
so you want me to lie to her?

19:57.375 --> 19:59.709
- Why not?
You do it for a living.

19:59.709 --> 20:01.417
Just tell her she'll be fine

20:01.417 --> 20:04.166
and imagine
there's a laugh track.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.625
- Jesus.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.000
- Next topic.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.709
- Seriously?
- I'm on the clock, here.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.417
- Fine. What?

20:10.417 --> 20:13.333
- That cocksucker who stole
your money, is anything left?

20:13.333 --> 20:15.291
- None of your business.

20:15.291 --> 20:17.500
- Well, it's my business
if you're gonna sell my condo.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.041
You know I got nothing
in the bank.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.625
- Well, whose fault is that?

20:21.625 --> 20:24.041
- I got to know.
Just tell me.

20:24.041 --> 20:27.208
Am I gonna have a place
to come home to?

20:31.250 --> 20:34.083
- Yes.

20:34.083 --> 20:36.500
- Yes?

20:36.500 --> 20:42.041
- Yeah,
I'm not selling the condo.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.250
- Promise?

20:44.250 --> 20:46.000
- I promise.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.291
- Liar.

20:47.291 --> 20:48.917
- It's what you just
told me to do.

20:48.917 --> 20:50.959
- To her, not to me. Ow.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.208
- Try not to move, sir.

20:53.208 --> 20:57.208
- Great, so at 86,
I'm circumcised.

20:58.834 --> 21:00.375
- Here you go.
You like Friends.

21:00.375 --> 21:01.792
Don't let him die in there.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.250
- Good luck, Mr. LeBlanc.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.375
- See you on the other side.
- The other side?

21:05.375 --> 21:07.417
- That sounded more final
than I meant.

21:07.417 --> 21:10.166
- Yeah, why not just tell him
to go toward the light?

21:10.166 --> 21:14.709
- Hey, hey, did
you ever get me a better doctor?

21:14.709 --> 21:16.166
- Yup.

21:16.166 --> 21:19.417
- Oh, shit.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.959
- What's the matter?

21:24.959 --> 21:29.500
- Nothing.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.709
- Are you okay?

21:30.709 --> 21:35.250
- Yeah, there's just something.
Mmm.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.000
- Oh, God.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.041
Is that one of mine?

21:39.041 --> 21:41.417
- Unless it's been there
for four months.

21:41.417 --> 21:43.333
- Oh, gross.

21:43.333 --> 21:44.583
- Come on.

21:44.583 --> 21:47.041
It's just a little pubie.

21:47.041 --> 21:50.083
What?

21:50.083 --> 21:53.375
- I'm gonna call
you little pubie.

21:53.375 --> 21:54.917
- Uh, no, you're not.

21:54.917 --> 21:58.000
- Little pubie.
- Stop.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.709
- I didn't get
to vote on Scrunchie.

22:00.709 --> 22:01.875
Oh, come on.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.667
It's sweet.
Pubie.

22:04.667 --> 22:07.750
- Worst pet name ever.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.083
- I know.

22:09.083 --> 22:10.709
- Scrunch?

22:10.709 --> 22:13.959
- Got to go.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.917
- Did I ever tell you
my dad was in Korea?

22:27.917 --> 22:28.959
- Oh, wow.

22:28.959 --> 22:30.583
- No, not the war,
the country.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.542
- Oh. Okay.

22:32.542 --> 22:35.834
- He just disappeared one day.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.500
I'm, like, 14.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.959
I go over to his apartment,

22:38.959 --> 22:41.959
and all his shit is gone,
just fucking gone.

22:41.959 --> 22:44.709
Months later, we find out
he's living in Korea.

22:44.709 --> 22:45.917
- Korea?

22:45.917 --> 22:47.709
Why Korea?

22:47.709 --> 22:51.250
- He got involved with some kind
of import-export thing.

22:51.250 --> 22:53.125
Something shady.

22:53.125 --> 22:56.375
When he finally came back,
he's got this Korean girl, 17.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.166
- Jesus, 17.

22:58.166 --> 23:01.667
- Yup. Her name
was, like, Pad Woon Sen.

23:01.667 --> 23:03.917
- That's actually
a Vietnamese noodle dish.

23:03.917 --> 23:05.959
- Is it? Oh, yeah.

23:05.959 --> 23:07.250
Well, something like that.

23:07.250 --> 23:11.166
- Before we
get too far, may I ask,

23:11.166 --> 23:14.500
is this story
going to be wildly racist?

23:14.500 --> 23:16.458
- Mmm, not wildly.

23:16.458 --> 23:18.333
- Okay, go on.

23:18.333 --> 23:21.041
- Anyway, Kung Pao Shrimp
is living at his apartment.

23:21.041 --> 23:22.542
- Clearly we have
different definitions

23:22.542 --> 23:23.500
for the word "wildly."

23:23.500 --> 23:26.500
- And by the way, she is hot.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.959
Every time I go over there,

23:27.959 --> 23:29.834
she's, like,
walking around in panties--

23:29.834 --> 23:32.500
- I'm sorry to interrupt again,
but does this end

23:32.500 --> 23:35.333
with you fucking
your father's girlfriend?

23:35.333 --> 23:37.917
- Uh, let a story unfold maybe.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.375
- Sorry.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.417
- Okay. Anyway, yeah,
I end up fucking her.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.834
So she's got me pinned up
against the refrigerator,

23:44.834 --> 23:47.625
and I'm like, "Oh, my God,"
'cause she's my first Korean.

23:47.625 --> 23:50.125
- Really?
Not until you were 14?

23:50.125 --> 23:51.792
- I lived in Boston.

23:51.792 --> 23:54.333
So right in the middle of it,
guess who walks in?

23:54.333 --> 23:55.917
- Of course he does.

23:55.917 --> 23:59.625
- And he starts screaming,
and she starts screaming,

23:59.625 --> 24:02.083
and he's, like,
trying to pull her off of me.

24:02.083 --> 24:04.208
But she's so tight,

24:04.208 --> 24:06.333
it's like getting one
of those Garfield things

24:06.333 --> 24:08.375
off your car window?
- Vivid.

24:08.375 --> 24:11.041
- Yeah. Next thing I know,
he's got me on the ground,

24:11.041 --> 24:12.125
and he grabs this chopstick.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.417
- Of course it's a chopstick.

24:13.417 --> 24:15.000
- Oh,
they were all over the place.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.583
And he slams it into my arm.
- Jesus.

24:17.583 --> 24:20.291
- I mean, into my arm,
right down to the tendon.

24:20.291 --> 24:21.500
- Holy shit.
- Oh, yeah.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.333
So this thing
is sticking out of my arm.

24:23.333 --> 24:25.750
I'm bleeding like a son
of a bitch,

24:25.750 --> 24:30.250
and all I can think is how much
I want my father to fucking die.

24:33.291 --> 24:35.917
I was thinking about that today.

24:35.917 --> 24:39.083
Be careful what you wish for.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.917
Hey, where have you been?
- Carol.

24:46.917 --> 24:49.083
Don't even ask.
Any news?

24:49.083 --> 24:52.000
- Nope. I'm starting
to get a bad feeling.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.583
This is taking too long.

24:53.583 --> 24:55.417
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

24:55.417 --> 24:59.083
- Why? He's been smoking
since he was 11.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.417
They probably opened him up
and found a pack

25:00.417 --> 25:01.500
of Tareytons in there.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.834
- Yet you still smoke.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.291
- I decided today I'm quitting.

25:04.291 --> 25:05.959
- Really? Good for you.

25:05.959 --> 25:07.375
- Yeah.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.041
Until you just said
the word "smoke."

25:09.041 --> 25:11.792
Now I got to have one.

25:11.792 --> 25:16.792
[phone ringing]

25:16.792 --> 25:17.875
Yo.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.083
- It's Bob.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.208
Good news.

25:20.208 --> 25:22.041
I got a buyer for the plane.

25:22.041 --> 25:23.917
- Oh, Jesus. How much?

25:23.917 --> 25:25.458
- Almost six,

25:25.458 --> 25:28.041
which is a lot more
than we thought we'd get.

25:28.041 --> 25:29.458
- Yeah, okay.

25:29.458 --> 25:32.125
- So we still need another two
for the IRS.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.500
- Oh, come on.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.792
- We've talked
about a couple options.

25:35.792 --> 25:39.458
We can sell the car collection
or your dad's condo.

25:39.458 --> 25:40.917
Which way you want to go?

25:40.917 --> 25:43.709
- [exhales]

25:46.542 --> 25:47.875
Sell the cars.

25:47.875 --> 25:50.166
- Really?
Not the condo?

25:50.166 --> 25:51.542
You sure?

25:51.542 --> 25:55.583
- Yeah, I'm sure.

26:04.291 --> 26:06.500
- Hey, Dad.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.333
- I got to pee.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.333
- Oh, that's just the catheter.

26:10.333 --> 26:15.000
And FYI, you are peeing.
- Oh.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.250
- I'm sorry I can't shake it.

26:19.250 --> 26:21.834
- So I'm not dead.

26:21.834 --> 26:23.625
- Everything went great.

26:23.625 --> 26:26.166
- You'll be out in a week.

26:26.166 --> 26:29.959
- Fucking Manitoba.

26:29.959 --> 26:32.166
Why are they still here?

26:32.166 --> 26:36.250
- I honestly do not know.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.583
- I want a sandwich.

26:37.583 --> 26:39.291
- No, no solid food.

26:39.291 --> 26:40.667
- Tomorrow maybe some broth.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.166
- Fuck broth.
- Calm down.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.792
When you get out of here,

26:44.792 --> 26:48.208
we'll celebrate, sandwiches,
whatever you want.

26:48.208 --> 26:50.250
- I want a car.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.792
- What?

26:51.792 --> 26:53.333
- I want a new car.

26:53.333 --> 26:55.458
Mine is six years old,

26:55.458 --> 26:58.041
and I want to celebrate
with a new car.

26:58.041 --> 27:00.375
- I'm not getting you a car.

27:00.375 --> 27:02.000
- What is the matter with you?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.625
The man almost died.

27:03.625 --> 27:05.500
If he wants a car,
get him a car.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.625
- I'm not buying him
a fucking car.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.166
- All right.

27:09.166 --> 27:10.959
What do you say we let
the patient get some rest?

27:10.959 --> 27:12.583
- Why don't you give him
one of yours? You have so many.

27:12.583 --> 27:13.917
- I don't want one of his.

27:13.917 --> 27:16.166
- And I don't got so many.
- Shh.

27:16.166 --> 27:17.458
- You shh.

27:17.458 --> 27:22.417
- He's not supposed
to get stressed.

27:22.417 --> 27:23.333
- Fine.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.083
We'll let you rest.

27:25.083 --> 27:26.417
- A Panamera.

27:26.417 --> 27:28.208
- I'm not getting
you a Panamera.

27:28.208 --> 27:31.375
- What, you should have one,
but I can't have one?

27:31.375 --> 27:32.875
- I don't have a Panamera.

27:32.875 --> 27:35.125
- Maybe if you're nice,
I'll let you borrow mine.

27:35.125 --> 27:38.291
- You're not getting a Panamera.

27:38.291 --> 27:39.667
- Cabriolet?
- No.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.917
- I think we have
all lost sight

27:41.917 --> 27:44.417
of the fact
that today was a gift.

27:44.417 --> 27:46.583
- Shut up.
You selfish bastard.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.667
You're the worst son ever.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.667
- Fuck you.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.291
- Don't you fuck her.

27:51.291 --> 27:52.792
Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

27:52.792 --> 27:55.959
- All right, all of you, enough.

27:55.959 --> 27:58.208
This man has just come
out of surgery.

27:58.208 --> 27:59.792
Unless you want
to send him back there,

27:59.792 --> 28:01.875
you'll speak to each other
in civil tones

28:01.875 --> 28:04.208
or you'll leave the room.

28:18.375 --> 28:21.333
- [civilly] Fuck you.

28:21.333 --> 28:27.041
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

28:27.041 --> 28:28.667
- Fuck you.

28:28.667 --> 28:32.250
- That's better.

28:32.250 --> 28:35.041
- Fuck you.
