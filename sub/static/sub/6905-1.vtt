01:13.441 --> 01:16.069
James McCullen, you Scottish pig,

01:16.177 --> 01:19.669
you've been found guilty of treason
for the sale of military arms

01:19.781 --> 01:22.978
to the enemies of our Lord,
King Louis XIII,

01:23.084 --> 01:26.053
even whilst you sold arms
to our Lord himself.

01:26.621 --> 01:31.923
Your king is a vile bag of filth
who murders his own allies.

01:33.027 --> 01:34.619
I should have charged him double.

01:34.729 --> 01:39.632
You tried to overthrow the Crown
in conspiracy with its enemies.

01:39.734 --> 01:42.965
Unlike your simpleton king,
his enemies know

01:43.071 --> 01:47.405
that it is the true McCullen destiny
not simply to supply arms,

01:47.509 --> 01:49.101
but to run the wars!

01:49.210 --> 01:51.940
Do you have anything else to say
before the sentence is carried out?

01:52.046 --> 01:53.536
Yes, I do.

01:53.648 --> 01:56.014
Clan McCullen is far greater
and more powerful

01:56.117 --> 01:58.210
than any of you could ever imagine.

01:58.319 --> 02:02.255
My sons will continue to rise
long after I am gone,

02:02.357 --> 02:03.722
as will their sons

02:03.825 --> 02:06.623
and, God willing, their sons.

02:06.728 --> 02:09.288
It shall not end with my death!

02:09.396 --> 02:12.798
We are not going to kill you, McCullen.

02:12.901 --> 02:15.461
We're going to make an example of you!

02:18.106 --> 02:23.703
So that no man, woman nor child may
ever see your treacherous face again,

02:24.245 --> 02:28.181
you shall wear this mask
for the term of your natural life.

02:28.283 --> 02:32.151
No! No! No!

02:45.567 --> 02:48.058
For nearly 4 centuries,
my ancestors have been

02:48.169 --> 02:50.933
the greatest creators of weaponry
in the world.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.972
But perhaps in this century,
I'll outdo them all.

02:56.945 --> 02:58.412
Nanomites, perfect little soldiers

02:58.513 --> 03:01.676
originally developed
to isolate and kill cancer cells.

03:01.783 --> 03:03.080
But at MARS Industries,

03:03.217 --> 03:05.651
and with the help
of a little NATO funding,

03:05.753 --> 03:08.984
we discovered how to program them
to do almost anything.

03:09.090 --> 03:11.684
For example, eat metal.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.896
Watch this test
of the world's first nanomite warhead.

03:17.298 --> 03:20.597
Each of these warheads
contains 7 million nanomites

03:20.702 --> 03:23.694
and has the ability to eat anything
from a single tank

03:24.806 --> 03:26.330
to an entire city.

03:29.177 --> 03:34.046
As you can see, it quickly converts
to eating any and all material in its path.

03:34.515 --> 03:38.542
Once unleashed,
the nanomites will not stop, ever.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.416
Once the target has been destroyed,

03:40.521 --> 03:43.285
the launcher triggers
a kill switch unique to each warhead

03:43.391 --> 03:47.691
that short-circuits the nanomites,
preventing any unwanted destruction.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.889
Gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce
that tomorrow morning,

03:50.999 --> 03:55.459
your first order of nanotech warheads
ships from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.322
Weapons case on the move.
ETA 2 minutes to NATO team.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.300
All right, listen up.
NATO wants the best of the best.

04:29.404 --> 04:32.032
That's why we're here.
We got Panthers front and back.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.471
RHINO's carrying the package
in the middle.

04:33.574 --> 04:37.032
Minimum distance at all times.
Apaches are covering us from overhead.

04:37.145 --> 04:40.239
Detail, attention. Fall out, boys.

04:40.515 --> 04:42.779
Captain Hauser,
Mr. McCullen requires a signature.

04:42.884 --> 04:44.146
Not gonna explode, is it?

04:44.252 --> 04:46.618
They're not weaponized yet,
and the kill switches are inside.

04:46.721 --> 04:49.519
All the same,
I'd avoid potholes if I were you.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.892
-Hey, Bill?
-Yeah?

04:52.994 --> 04:55.019
Put that in the RHINO, would you?

04:56.464 --> 04:57.624
All right, ladies! Mount up!

05:16.084 --> 05:18.609
Okay, Apaches, we're heavy,
so keep your eyes open.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.120
Roger that.
Skies are clear all the way to Ganci.

05:30.098 --> 05:33.067
-Hey, Duke, I've been thinking.
-You know, I warned you about that.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.600
I've been thinking about
where we should transfer to.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.329
-Don't say the Air Force.
-The Air Force!

05:36.437 --> 05:38.667
What did I say? I thought
we were done with this conversation.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.331
You were done with this conversation,
not me.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.441
You know, I've been flying

05:41.509 --> 05:42.567
-since I was 13 years old.
-13 years old.

05:42.677 --> 05:45.145
You know, I don't think your dad's
crop-duster counts as hours logged.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.242
I'm talking jets, man. Jets.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.183
And you know I qualify
every time we're on leave.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.180
-You want to get up in the air?
-Yeah.

05:54.288 --> 05:57.451
-I'll buy you a trampoline.
-I filled out the application.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.384
Really? They accept those in crayon?

06:00.495 --> 06:02.224
Come on, dude.
Give me one good reason why not.

06:02.330 --> 06:05.731
'Cause I want to be on the ground,
in the fight, not flying over it.

06:17.879 --> 06:20.575
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2,
going night vision.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.581
-Roger that.
-Go ahead and back off.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.480
Give me some separation.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.951
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2. Going NVS.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.054
Roger.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.550
Hey, Duke,
weren't we supposed to meet up

06:32.660 --> 06:34.423
with the recon team at 40 klicks?

06:34.529 --> 06:37.987
-Yeah. So?
-Well, we just passed kilometer 41.

06:40.268 --> 06:43.169
-Eyes out, eyes out!
-Sweep's still clear, sir.

06:43.271 --> 06:45.933
Roger that.
There's nothing up here but us.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.548
Tom, put a self-test on the flare
and start to scan for...

06:56.651 --> 06:57.879
Holy...

06:58.352 --> 06:59.683
What the hell is that?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.025
Pioneer 1, you've been hit.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.892
Stop!

07:15.703 --> 07:17.671
-Bird down! Bird down!
-Back up! Back up! Back up!

07:17.772 --> 07:20.172
All units, we are under attack!
They're after the warheads!

07:20.274 --> 07:21.298
Pioneer 2, engage!

07:21.409 --> 07:24.435
-Put that asshole on the ground!
-Roger that. Put some hurt on this guy!

07:27.348 --> 07:29.908
Tommy guns. Firing, firing, firing!

07:32.653 --> 07:33.915
-Missiles armed.
-Match and shoot.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.420
Match and shoot! Missiles off!

07:39.727 --> 07:41.285
They shot them right out of the air.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.094
Oh, my God.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.235
-Pioneer 2 is down! We've lost our air!
-They're boxing us in!

07:57.345 --> 07:59.905
All units, fan out!
I repeat, all units, fan out!

08:10.258 --> 08:13.159
I want SAMs on that thing!
Light him up! Light him up!

08:22.136 --> 08:24.036
He's coming around.
Get those.50s on him!

08:30.544 --> 08:32.010
Incoming!

08:34.414 --> 08:35.643
Hold on!

08:40.187 --> 08:41.484
You okay?

08:41.589 --> 08:44.615
Yeah, but my leg is pinned.
What the hell was that?

09:32.506 --> 09:34.133
-Come on, we gotta get in this fight.
-Careful, my leg!

09:34.241 --> 09:35.765
Come on, buddy, let's go.
Let's go, get up, come on!

09:40.247 --> 09:42.112
Duke, you gotta go get those warheads!

09:42.216 --> 09:44.446
Shut up! I gotta get you out of here first!

09:46.620 --> 09:48.815
Fire at the opening!
Right side, right side!

09:54.829 --> 09:56.592
Get up, get up, get up, get up!

09:58.532 --> 09:59.931
My damn leg!

10:01.635 --> 10:03.034
-You wait here, okay?
-Where are you going?

10:03.137 --> 10:04.365
I gotta go get that case.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.735
Air Force, right.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.214
Don't move!

10:20.454 --> 10:22.820
-Hello, Duke.
-Ana?

10:24.892 --> 10:27.622
Now, you have to admit,
you had that coming.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.230
Ana!

10:43.110 --> 10:44.270
Ana!

11:18.979 --> 11:20.310
Bye-bye.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.217
Ana! Ana!

11:42.903 --> 11:44.165
Don't make me shoot a woman.

11:47.408 --> 11:48.898
Incoming!

12:10.831 --> 12:12.128
Stand down. Stand the hell down!

12:12.233 --> 12:14.463
-Put the weapon down, sir.
-We're not the enemy.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.798
Pointing your weapons at me doesn't
make you my friend, now, does it?

12:16.904 --> 12:17.962
Please hand over the case, sir.

12:18.072 --> 12:20.540
I don't know you, and I sure as hell
don't know who they are,

12:20.641 --> 12:22.472
and until I find out,
I'm not lowering anything

12:22.576 --> 12:23.804
and I ain't handing anything over.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.539
If it weren't for us, you'd be out there
with the rest of your boys.

12:26.647 --> 12:29.241
-So hand over the case.
-What's your unit?

12:29.350 --> 12:30.442
That's classified.

12:30.551 --> 12:32.610
Someone would like to have
a word with you.

12:37.358 --> 12:38.950
State your name and rank.

12:39.693 --> 12:42.093
-You first.
-My team just saved your life, son.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.357
This is the part
where you get to say thank you.

12:44.465 --> 12:45.830
Those aren't the words
that come to mind right now.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.163
I wasn't told anything
about any support for this mission,

12:48.269 --> 12:49.702
so why don't you tell your team
to stand down?

12:49.803 --> 12:51.430
We could turn this
into one big turkey shoot.

12:51.539 --> 12:52.699
Yep.

12:54.008 --> 12:55.134
Or not.

12:55.576 --> 12:57.237
Easy, Ripcord.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.005
-How do you know me?
-Expert marksman,

12:59.113 --> 13:03.049
second in your battalion.
Weapons specialist, jet qualified.

13:03.484 --> 13:04.917
-I told you.
-Not now, Rip.

13:05.019 --> 13:09.513
My name is General Clayton Abernathy.
Perhaps you've heard of me, Duke.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.490
General Hawk.
Afghanistan, NATO forward command.

13:12.593 --> 13:16.495
Yeah, that was my last job.
I'm in a whole new outfit now.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.032
Hey, I just need to deactivate
the tracking beacon for security.

13:20.134 --> 13:23.831
Put down that weapons case, son,
and let us deliver those warheads.

13:23.938 --> 13:25.667
No way. I signed for them.

13:25.773 --> 13:28.333
It's my mission, my package.
I carry them, I deliver them.

13:28.442 --> 13:31.878
Well, that's just fine, but you seem to be
a little short of transportation right now,

13:31.979 --> 13:34.709
so my Team Alpha
will deliver you to me.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.613
And where exactly are you, sir?

13:37.218 --> 13:39.049
Come see for yourself.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.429
I thought all you Special Ops guys
were tough.

13:54.535 --> 13:57.129
We are tough. But we're also sensitive.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.767
I got it. Thanks.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.501
Wow, this is some primo stuff here.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.506
Hey, bro, you got
some real lifelike hair over there.

14:06.614 --> 14:08.138
And a kung fu grip.

14:08.249 --> 14:09.944
-Lie down.
-Okay.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.517
What kind of outfit is this, anyway?

14:11.619 --> 14:14.053
It's not regular Army,
based on all the accents.

14:14.455 --> 14:16.514
You're British.
What are you, French North African?

14:16.624 --> 14:18.148
Morocco. Where were you born?

14:18.259 --> 14:20.454
Duke wasn't born.
He was government-issued.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.394
-What about you?
-He doesn't speak.

14:23.497 --> 14:25.465
-Why?
-He doesn't say.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.524
He doesn't say.
So, somehow you're all in the same unit,

14:28.636 --> 14:30.467
but one you can't tell me
the name of, right?

14:30.571 --> 14:31.833
We'd get tossed for telling.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.840
You're gonna go after those guys
that hit my convoy, huh?

14:36.777 --> 14:39.644
Well, whoever you are
and whatever this unit is,

14:40.714 --> 14:42.079
I want in.

15:17.318 --> 15:18.444
General.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.151
-What's up, girl?
-Good job, Joes.

15:20.254 --> 15:21.619
Outstanding.

15:21.922 --> 15:25.255
Welcome to the Pit, Duke.
I've read a lot about you two.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.520
Well, you can't believe
everything you read. See, I actually...

15:27.628 --> 15:30.426
I understand we even tried to recruit you
a few years back.

15:30.531 --> 15:32.897
-I never got asked to join any Op group.
-Really?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.366
You don't remember Thailand
about 4 years ago?

15:35.469 --> 15:37.528
Right before you broke up that bar?

15:37.638 --> 15:39.230
About 4 years ago,
my boy had issues.

15:39.340 --> 15:40.671
I mean, his issues had issues.

15:41.542 --> 15:43.533
I've been in the military my entire life

15:43.644 --> 15:46.044
and I have never seen
a tac operation like this.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.013
All right, you trusted me,
I guess I'll trust you.

15:49.116 --> 15:52.244
Technically, G.I. Joe does not exist,
but if it did,

15:52.353 --> 15:54.514
it'd be comprised
of the top men and women

15:54.621 --> 15:58.113
from the best military units in the world,
the alpha dogs.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.088
When all else fails, we don't.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.731
10 nations signed on in our first year,

16:05.833 --> 16:08.859
working together, sharing intel.
Now we have 23.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.001
-What's that?
-Camouflage suit.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.109
It photographs everything behind you
and puts it in front of you.

16:18.312 --> 16:21.372
-Mr. McCullen is standing by, sir.
-Patch him through via TelePresence.

16:21.482 --> 16:23.177
-So who hit us?
-Currently unknown.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.511
But one thing's for sure,

16:24.618 --> 16:27.178
she's got highly classified intel
and state-of-the-art weaponry,

16:27.287 --> 16:29.118
which means there's a whole
hell of a lot of money behind her.

16:29.223 --> 16:31.783
Their capabilities are beyond anything
we've ever encountered.

16:31.892 --> 16:34.861
Yeah, that's the one and only reason
why we got our asses kicked out there.

16:34.962 --> 16:37.260
We need to find out
everything we can about her.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.059
Knowing is half the battle.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.496
Gentlemen, Mr. McCullen,

16:43.937 --> 16:47.270
CEO of MARS Industries
and the builder of these warheads.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.138
General, clearly you were the
security option I should have chosen.

16:50.244 --> 16:54.010
What did you just say? My team
did everything we could out there,

16:54.114 --> 16:56.981
-and a lot of good men went down.
-Yeah, but not you.

16:57.084 --> 17:00.713
That mission was classified,
so clearly someone sold us out.

17:00.821 --> 17:04.689
I spent 10 years and 13 billion euros
creating these 4 warheads.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.454
Your job, Captain, was to protect them,

17:07.560 --> 17:10.189
and if it wasn't for General Hawk,
you'd have failed.

17:10.297 --> 17:13.960
That's not a fair assessment.
He followed his orders to the letter.

17:14.568 --> 17:16.433
Well, that wasn't enough.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.506
Now, so the bastards who attacked you
can't find you,

17:19.606 --> 17:22.131
you need to disable
the tracking beacon hidden in the case.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.143
-We already have.
-Good man.

17:25.244 --> 17:28.407
But allow me to check them
to see if any have been damaged.

17:36.857 --> 17:38.449
Open it, please.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.027
My scan says they're intact, sir.

17:41.128 --> 17:45.428
-What's the code?
-5-2-9-4-4-0.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.122
Please keep me informed
of your progress, General.

18:16.697 --> 18:18.221
Breaker?

18:18.332 --> 18:22.132
My voice analyzer on that guy
was going up, down and sideways.

18:22.236 --> 18:25.637
Looks like McCullen's working an angle
he don't want us to catch.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.999
We're on a deadline.
We need those warheads now!

18:29.109 --> 18:32.101
You knew that!
10 years setting this up,

18:32.212 --> 18:36.114
wringing money out of NATO,
this was supposed to be the easy part.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.083
If you had let me stage the assault
at your precious factory,

18:39.186 --> 18:40.346
I could have contained the situation.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.979
And lost the trust of our clients
in the process.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.183
It had to be NATO's fault!

18:49.263 --> 18:50.730
What happened?

18:51.965 --> 18:54.559
-Did you hesitate when you saw him?
-No.

18:54.935 --> 18:57.369
This had nothing to do with him.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.301
Forgive my jealousy.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.378
Have you tracked the case?

19:08.482 --> 19:11.246
They, of course,
deactivated the homing beacon.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.651
I gave them a code
to quietly reactivate it.

19:15.989 --> 19:20.449
It's in Egypt.
The Pit, only mentioned in whispers.

19:21.562 --> 19:23.655
I will get those warheads back.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.588
I hope so.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.867
If I were really there,
I might actually let you touch me.

19:32.973 --> 19:36.500
-I'll send a jet.
-Business first.

19:37.077 --> 19:39.477
Besides, I'm married, remember?

19:40.814 --> 19:44.648
If you had sent me in the first place,
it would already be done.

19:46.119 --> 19:49.418
I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
No more mistakes.

19:49.523 --> 19:52.492
The schedule mustn't be compromised
any further.

19:52.593 --> 19:54.618
Keep your eye on her for me.

19:54.728 --> 19:59.131
American politics,
governors, senators, congressmen.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.961
No wonder nothing ever gets done.

20:01.068 --> 20:03.400
That's what we're going to fix,
Mr. Zartan.

20:31.632 --> 20:35.193
The king cobra, magnificent creature.

20:35.302 --> 20:38.635
Nature's Grim Reaper
and symbol of lethal purpose.

20:38.739 --> 20:41.139
Unseen until it strikes.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.668
Its venom can kill a full-grown elephant
with a single bite.

20:44.778 --> 20:47.975
-Very nice.
-So far we've created 20 Neo-Vipers.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.879
-19 stand before you.
-Is it working?

20:50.984 --> 20:56.115
We injected 1,000 cc of
the nanomite solution into each subject.

20:56.223 --> 20:58.919
When they finally stopped screaming,

20:59.026 --> 21:01.017
brain scans showed
a complete inactivity

21:01.128 --> 21:03.255
of the self-preservation region
of the cortex.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.728
English, Doctor?

21:08.068 --> 21:10.263
They feel no fear.

21:14.007 --> 21:17.534
Cortical nerve clusters
show complete inactivity.

21:18.578 --> 21:23.641
They feel no pain.
Concepts of morality are disengaged.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.686
They feel no regrets, no remorse.

21:31.024 --> 21:34.619
The nanomites join together
as a fighting mechanism,

21:34.728 --> 21:38.391
first blocking, then expelling
the cobra's venom.

21:42.903 --> 21:45.030
And they're completely obedient?

21:47.140 --> 21:48.471
Of course.

21:49.843 --> 21:52.744
The real-world applications are endless.

21:53.313 --> 21:57.010
So, you tell me, is it working?

21:58.218 --> 22:01.187
Send a team to rendezvous
with Storm Shadow and the Baroness.

22:01.288 --> 22:05.554
Consider it done.
The Joes will never know what hit them.

22:08.995 --> 22:12.089
The 20th Neo-Viper is already set up
in Washington, DC

22:12.199 --> 22:13.393
and awaiting your signal.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.731
You've done well. You've thrown
the caber clear out of the yard.

22:16.837 --> 22:19.738
Construction of the presidential bunker
has also been completed.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.308
Now, if we sold one warhead
on the black market,

22:22.409 --> 22:23.671
I could continue my research.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.768
I appreciate your thirst
for knowledge, Doctor,

22:25.879 --> 22:28.177
but this world is messy enough. No.

22:29.182 --> 22:32.811
What it needs is unification, leadership.

22:33.954 --> 22:38.448
It has to be taken out of chaos
by someone with complete control.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.924
Beijing, Moscow, Washington...

22:44.364 --> 22:46.025
When these missiles detonate,

22:46.133 --> 22:49.193
the world will turn
to the most powerful man on the planet.

22:50.771 --> 22:54.070
When I'm finished,
the money will take care of itself.

22:54.174 --> 22:57.200
You'll be able to do
all the research you want.

23:03.483 --> 23:06.475
We grabbed this image
from one of our tactical cameras.

23:06.586 --> 23:09.350
Now we're running her face
through an infinity scan.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.181
Hey, isn't that...

23:13.760 --> 23:16.820
We have access to any photograph
on any server, anywhere in the world.

23:16.930 --> 23:20.093
Yep. Everyone gets photographed
in some way at some time.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.361
Football game, ATM machine, airport...

23:22.469 --> 23:25.597
We'll find her,
and then we'll find out who sent her.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.969
-From NATO, sir.
-Are you okay?

23:28.975 --> 23:30.602
What happened to her?

23:32.245 --> 23:36.011
Well, it appears that I've been made
official custodian of the warheads.

23:36.116 --> 23:38.141
Looks like your mission
is complete here, Duke.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.845
When you move them, she's gonna
come after you. You know that, right?

23:40.954 --> 23:43.616
And with her intel and toys,
she'll find you.

23:43.723 --> 23:44.723
What's your point?

23:44.791 --> 23:47.521
You're going after her first
and we want in.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.653
General, it was our team that got wasted
out there. We deserve payback.

23:50.764 --> 23:54.495
You don't ask to be part of G.I. Joe.
You get asked.

23:55.669 --> 23:58.934
You scouted me 4 years ago.
Now I'm ready. Let's have at it.

23:59.039 --> 24:00.836
Well, I've lost men, too, Captain.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.568
-If you want revenge...
-I know her.

24:02.676 --> 24:03.676
Excuse me?

24:03.777 --> 24:06.405
You said
knowing's half the battle, right?

24:06.513 --> 24:08.447
Well, I know who she is.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.543
She was a blonde.
Her name is Ana Lewis.

24:11.651 --> 24:14.017
I could tell you everything
you need to know about her,

24:14.120 --> 24:15.815
up until the last 4 years.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.186
After that, obviously,
a lot of things have changed.

24:38.411 --> 24:39.935
Finally, my wife is home.

24:44.517 --> 24:47.418
Hello, Daniel. How was your meeting
with the Minister of Defense?

24:47.520 --> 24:50.819
He was thrilled.
The accelerator performed flawlessly.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.256
I wish you would have been there.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.624
You and your little lab rats
are so clever.

24:55.729 --> 24:58.357
-How was Monte Carlo?
-I didn't get what I was after.

24:58.465 --> 25:01.161
-I suppose I should be grateful.
-Most husbands would be.

25:01.268 --> 25:04.135
Most husbands don't have
such mysterious wives.

25:04.237 --> 25:06.467
They know exactly where they are
and what they do.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.835
They think they know.

25:07.941 --> 25:11.104
Ana, I don't wanna fight. I missed you.

25:11.211 --> 25:13.543
Well, I never tire of a good fight.

25:15.448 --> 25:19.407
But not with you, darling. Let me
freshen up and I'll meet you downstairs.

25:19.519 --> 25:22.579
I do love you, my beautiful Baroness.

25:28.762 --> 25:32.994
McCullen gave me orders to kill
the Baron if he so much as touched you.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.932
Well, he's my husband.
Of course he touches me.

25:36.036 --> 25:39.437
And besides, his work at the lab goes
much better after we've touched.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.473
And that's the important thing.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.338
So what are you doing? Spying on me?

25:45.378 --> 25:48.973
If I was spying on you,
you would never know.

25:52.485 --> 25:53.975
Getting closer.

25:54.688 --> 25:56.656
You were my best student.

25:58.491 --> 26:01.187
I'll be coming with you
to retrieve the warheads.

26:01.294 --> 26:02.761
We go at dawn.

26:26.286 --> 26:27.651
Come on, Ana.

26:30.290 --> 26:34.351
Okay, so, I've been wanting to do this
before we deploy.

26:42.369 --> 26:45.736
Duke, it's beautiful. It's too beautiful.

26:45.839 --> 26:48.706
I'm only going to buy one of these,
so why not?

26:51.478 --> 26:52.968
So what do you say?

26:53.079 --> 26:55.877
Say yes, you idiot.
He's a real American hero.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.074
Thanks for ruining the mood, Rex.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.515
I apologize. I just came to offer you
a ride back to post.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.348
What? It's time already?

27:01.454 --> 27:04.252
-Yeah, we got to go at 0500.
-Is it...

27:05.058 --> 27:07.686
Yeah, it is, right? That's why
you're pulling Rex out of the lab.

27:07.794 --> 27:12.094
-Ana, look, I'm sorry, but I can't...
-Yeah, yeah, classified, top secret,

27:12.198 --> 27:13.756
you'd have to kill me if you told me,
blah-blah-blah.

27:13.867 --> 27:17.861
And speaking of classified information,
you still haven't answered me.

27:19.172 --> 27:22.733
Yes. Yes. Of course it's yes.

27:23.977 --> 27:25.535
On one condition.

27:26.279 --> 27:29.680
You have to promise me
that you will not let my genius,

27:29.783 --> 27:31.751
egghead brother get hurt.

27:32.419 --> 27:34.751
He's the only family I've got left.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.755
Promise me, Duke.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.188
I promise.

27:41.828 --> 27:45.264
-Hey! My 3 favorite people.
-Mr. Weems. Good, man?

27:45.365 --> 27:46.593
-Yeah.
-Look.

27:46.699 --> 27:50.396
Wow. Nice rock. That's a lot of love.

27:51.271 --> 27:53.068
-Are you proposing?
-I'm actually done proposing.

27:53.173 --> 27:56.609
-I already said yes.
-Oh, my God! Congratulations!

27:56.709 --> 28:00.167
Beautiful! You guys are like the little
white couple on the wedding cake.

28:00.580 --> 28:02.673
How cute. Give me some love.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.980
Congratulations. Wait. It's not official.

28:06.086 --> 28:08.020
-What?
-It's not official.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.749
-Not until you answer my question.
-Okay.

28:11.925 --> 28:13.586
Do you love my boy?

28:15.495 --> 28:18.293
Always and forever.

28:22.936 --> 28:25.632
You may have blackmailed
your way onto this team.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.603
Doesn't mean I've got to like it.

28:28.174 --> 28:31.007
But it does mean
I've gotta get you mission ready,

28:31.411 --> 28:32.708
Joe style.

28:33.680 --> 28:37.514
Standing in front of you
are Delta-6 Accelerator suits.

28:37.617 --> 28:39.517
-What does it accelerate?
-You.

28:39.619 --> 28:43.555
It'll make you run faster, jump higher
and hit harder than any of your enemies.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.421
Let's suit up.

28:45.525 --> 28:49.689
Head-to-toe hydraulics
and highly pressurized pneumatics.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.933
An advanced cybernetics
heads-up display helmet,

28:55.034 --> 28:56.763
which feeds into the suit.

28:56.870 --> 28:58.838
You think it, it does it.

29:01.474 --> 29:03.271
Twin gas-propelled grappling spears

29:03.376 --> 29:06.436
and triple-explosive,
heat-seeking, fire-and-forget rockets.

29:06.546 --> 29:08.173
And my personal favorite,

29:08.281 --> 29:11.114
a 10-millimeter caseless
Gatling submachine gun,

29:11.217 --> 29:15.449
capable of firing 50 rounds per second.
Fully self-contained firepower.

29:15.555 --> 29:17.648
Perfect for a couple of cowboys like you.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.754
I just missed everything you said.
Hey, how do I look?

29:21.861 --> 29:23.351
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Any questions?

29:40.647 --> 29:41.807
Yo, Sergeant Stone.

29:41.915 --> 29:44.611
-Are they Joes?
-Hell, no. They're jokes.

29:45.185 --> 29:46.243
Boys.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.644
You're gonna need these.

29:54.928 --> 29:57.897
Just so you know,
when I get a target in my sights,

29:58.665 --> 30:00.155
I take it down.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.194
Oh, shit!

30:05.071 --> 30:06.800
-Again.
-Again?

30:22.088 --> 30:26.218
Just so you know, some targets
are harder to hit than others.

30:31.464 --> 30:34.058
-Again.
-You're gonna need that helmet.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.206
Stand down, Snake Eyes.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.281
All right. Walk away. It's over.
This ain't pay-per-view.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.585
I'm nasty with it!

30:55.688 --> 30:56.712
You missed one.

30:56.823 --> 30:58.723
Come on. That gotta be
some kind of a record or something.

30:58.825 --> 31:01.453
-The record is all 20 killed.
-Who did that? Let me guess.

31:01.561 --> 31:04.086
-Snake Eyes?
-No. Me.

31:04.197 --> 31:08.258
If you're gonna shoot at something,
kill it. Otherwise, take up knitting.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.638
Beginner's luck. Stay focused.

31:25.151 --> 31:27.016
-Again.
-Again?

31:33.326 --> 31:35.556
I have never seen Snake Eyes take a hit.

31:36.229 --> 31:37.787
They're Joes.

31:39.232 --> 31:40.290
Maybe.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.032
Let's go.

31:48.775 --> 31:52.871
Hey, man, Breaker told me that Scarlett
graduated college at 12 years old.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.373
She's like some freaky little
deadly genius.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.847
-Rip. I get it, Rip. You like her.
-Sorry, my bad.

32:01.154 --> 32:04.646
-To hell with it.
-Rip. Rip.

32:07.327 --> 32:09.818
Into the valley of death rode the 600.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.523
Hey, what are you doing?
A little beach reading?

32:14.300 --> 32:15.324
Okay.

32:17.403 --> 32:21.100
Look, I think you and me
got off on the wrong foot.

32:21.641 --> 32:26.271
See, I'm attracted to you.
And you, you're attracted to me.

32:26.713 --> 32:28.305
And him, the damn Zen master,

32:28.414 --> 32:30.245
he creeps me out.
What I'm trying to say is...

32:30.350 --> 32:32.818
-We're attracted to each other.
-Thank you!

32:32.919 --> 32:35.615
That's what you're saying.
It's not what I'm saying.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.415
It's not?

32:38.558 --> 32:40.253
So, what are you saying?

32:43.296 --> 32:46.823
Attraction is an emotion.
Emotions are not based in science.

32:46.933 --> 32:50.733
And if you can't quantify
or prove that something exists, well,

32:50.837 --> 32:52.737
in my mind, it doesn't.

32:54.407 --> 32:56.500
Okay. I'll get back to you on that one.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.644
Attention! General on deck!

32:59.746 --> 33:02.146
At ease. Duke,

33:02.248 --> 33:05.740
you scored in the top half percent
of all people we've ever tested.

33:06.386 --> 33:10.083
Rip, if we average your scores
with Duke's, you pass, too.

33:10.556 --> 33:11.955
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you, sir.

33:12.058 --> 33:14.390
-Provisionally, of course.
-Thank you, sir.

33:34.046 --> 33:37.243
Sir, sensors detecting seismic activity
to the southwest.

33:37.350 --> 33:39.045
Probably just a tremor,
but have a team check it.

34:27.467 --> 34:29.297
There's our little weapons case.

34:29.402 --> 34:32.371
All right. You 3, guard the machines.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.995
-Sorry to disturb you, sir.
-That's all right, Corporal.

35:03.102 --> 35:06.902
I need you to sign here, here and here.
And also here, here...

35:18.384 --> 35:20.079
Goodbye, sweetheart.

35:25.391 --> 35:27.951
That's right. You don't kill women.

35:28.060 --> 35:30.585
For you, Zartan, I'd make an exception.

35:59.025 --> 36:00.583
Warheads, Rip! Come on!

36:05.898 --> 36:07.024
Go, go!

36:11.137 --> 36:13.571
We've got the warheads.
Prep the Mole Pods for evac.

36:13.673 --> 36:15.800
-We're on our way.
-We're already on it.

36:32.525 --> 36:34.755
-Now how do we get out of here?
-Follow me.

36:37.096 --> 36:38.893
Like that's gonna happen.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.970
Find the control room.
Open the exterior hatch.

36:52.078 --> 36:54.012
-And secure this area.
-We're on it.

36:58.985 --> 37:00.077
Clear.

37:10.930 --> 37:12.022
Go, go!

37:14.967 --> 37:18.403
-Can you fly one of these things?
-Don't move! Ana, put the case down.

37:19.138 --> 37:21.606
Fine. Done.

37:24.210 --> 37:26.178
Stop. Ana, stop right there.

37:26.278 --> 37:28.838
-You can't shoot me, can you?
-I will if I have to.

37:28.948 --> 37:31.644
Deep down, you're still the same man
I fell in love with.

37:31.751 --> 37:35.312
-Don't force this.
-What could have been. Right, Duke?

37:36.389 --> 37:38.721
Just give me the case, God damn it.

37:38.824 --> 37:43.887
-Move and I'm gonna blow her away.
-Do it. You already killed me once.

37:44.730 --> 37:45.992
Duke, watch out!

37:58.577 --> 37:59.669
Ana, drop the case!

38:14.260 --> 38:15.386
Hello, brother.

38:42.088 --> 38:43.146
Damn!

38:48.094 --> 38:49.356
Eat this!

39:13.452 --> 39:14.783
Hey, genius!

40:28.828 --> 40:30.159
See you, Duke.

40:59.058 --> 41:02.027
-How many warheads?
-4, Mr. President.

41:02.127 --> 41:05.290
-Any threats? Demands?
-None so far, sir.

41:05.397 --> 41:07.365
We take this to mean
the terrorists are unfocused.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.366
-No clear goals.
-No.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.827
It means they intend to use them.

41:14.073 --> 41:15.597
General Hawk is stable now,

41:15.708 --> 41:18.040
but he won't be conscious
for another day or so.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.872
He's one tough bastard.

41:32.024 --> 41:33.116
Hey.

41:36.228 --> 41:37.991
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

41:38.731 --> 41:41.564
-I didn't want anyone to see me like this.
-Why?

41:42.768 --> 41:44.827
I don't know. All the men we lost,
General Hawk wounded,

41:44.937 --> 41:46.564
my neck just doesn't seem important.

41:46.672 --> 41:50.665
You almost lost your life out there.
You have a reason to be concerned.

41:52.978 --> 41:55.071
First fight I lost since I was a kid.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.907
My father taught me to win.

41:59.018 --> 42:04.684
Look, I don't see how you could teach
anybody to win everything every time.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.158
I mean, look at you.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.117
You're still here, right?

42:10.596 --> 42:12.962
You get knocked down, you get back up.

42:13.098 --> 42:15.225
Maybe that's
what he wanted you to learn.

42:17.736 --> 42:20.637
But then again,
that would be an emotional response,

42:20.739 --> 42:23.401
one that can't be explained or quantified.

42:40.426 --> 42:43.657
Hey. Looks like we're all
seeing ghosts today, huh?

44:22.157 --> 44:23.556
Storm Shadow!

44:27.529 --> 44:30.657
English, Storm Shadow.
Where are your manners?

44:31.032 --> 44:32.465
He is hungry.

44:32.867 --> 44:36.894
We need to invite him in
and show him the path.

44:37.372 --> 44:41.365
-He is a cur, a weakling!
-He does not fight like one.

44:46.981 --> 44:49.279
Now, what shall we call you?

44:55.557 --> 44:57.855
This belonged to an ancestor of mine.

44:58.626 --> 45:01.026
He was caught selling arms
to both sides.

45:01.129 --> 45:04.326
The French forced him to wear it
for the rest of his life.

45:04.432 --> 45:07.924
They called him Destro,
destroyer of nations.

45:08.470 --> 45:09.903
So why do you keep it?

45:10.004 --> 45:12.666
So that I never forget
the most important rule in dealing arms.

45:12.774 --> 45:15.334
Let me guess. Never sell to both sides?

45:15.443 --> 45:17.911
Never get caught selling to both sides.

45:20.949 --> 45:23.213
Take the warheads to Paris.
Have them weaponized.

45:23.318 --> 45:25.445
-Then I want you to test one.
-Test one?

45:25.553 --> 45:28.249
We'll let CNN show the world
how well they perform.

45:29.691 --> 45:31.750
Fear is a great motivator.

45:35.163 --> 45:39.259
I have a target in mind,
one the French will never forget,

45:40.135 --> 45:43.434
as I've never forgotten
what they did to Clan McCullen.

45:53.348 --> 45:56.283
-Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?
-Born ready, Doctor.

45:56.384 --> 45:58.352
This is going to be
the achievement of a lifetime.

45:58.453 --> 46:01.422
Yes, as a master of disguise,
you have no equal, my friend.

46:01.523 --> 46:05.459
18 months of studying my target,
learning mannerisms,

46:05.560 --> 46:07.357
but the devil is in the details.

46:07.462 --> 46:10.226
Gentlemen, let's get it going.

46:10.331 --> 46:11.525
One more thing.

46:11.633 --> 46:14.227
I'll control my own brain,
thank you very much.

46:17.705 --> 46:19.036
Let's do this.

46:37.926 --> 46:41.453
-Wow. That was a bit nasty.
-Think so?

46:42.730 --> 46:44.391
Let's run some tests.

46:46.034 --> 46:52.030
Eye color. Skin tone. Hair follicles.

46:52.540 --> 46:56.374
And initiating facial reconstruction tests.

47:07.055 --> 47:08.750
We gotta find out
who's holding their leash.

47:08.856 --> 47:12.314
With their weaponry, financing
and intel, these guys are high-line pros.

47:12.427 --> 47:14.122
That limits the possibilities.

47:14.229 --> 47:17.528
-Hey, the weapons case.
-What?

47:17.632 --> 47:19.224
Remember, McCullen had us
open the weapons case?

47:19.334 --> 47:21.029
-What about it?
-I bet you he gave us a code

47:21.135 --> 47:23.296
that reactivated the tracking beacon.

47:23.404 --> 47:26.896
You're right.
McCullen, that son of a bitch.

47:27.008 --> 47:29.374
So, McCullen uses NATO
to fund his R&D

47:29.477 --> 47:31.138
and then he steals the warheads back.

47:31.246 --> 47:35.910
-And who says you're not a thinker?
-Hey, I found her.

47:37.051 --> 47:38.416
Yeah, that's her all right.

47:38.519 --> 47:42.421
Her name is Ana de Cobray.
Baroness, if you're feeling formal.

47:42.523 --> 47:46.050
Baroness? Wow, she really traded up.
Financially, of course.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.219
-Who's he?
-Daniel de Cobray.

47:48.329 --> 47:51.059
Big shot French scientist.
Runs a lab in Paris.

47:51.165 --> 47:54.100
-Lab? What kind of lab?
-Particle accelerator.

47:55.370 --> 47:58.771
Oh, my God. They're going to use him
to weaponize the warheads.

47:59.674 --> 48:01.665
Well, that's where she's going.

48:01.776 --> 48:02.936
I like croissants.

48:34.642 --> 48:37.372
-Go, go, go!
-Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

48:37.578 --> 48:39.068
Pull up on the truck!

48:42.750 --> 48:44.183
Go, go, go!

48:45.286 --> 48:48.380
-2 o'clock!
-Go, go, go!

48:48.489 --> 48:49.820
Go, let's move!

48:52.927 --> 48:55.555
-In the alley!
-Get down, get down!

48:55.663 --> 48:56.960
You see them?

48:59.300 --> 49:02.360
-2 more on the left!
-Get down!

49:02.470 --> 49:04.938
Dubble Bubble? It always helps me.

49:06.641 --> 49:09.201
Yeah. Hey, you good?

49:10.011 --> 49:11.342
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

49:13.381 --> 49:16.043
All right, Mr. Science Officer,
you're up, okay?

49:16.150 --> 49:18.050
You don't find it in 4 minutes,
you get out of there.

49:18.152 --> 49:22.145
That house will not be there in 5.
I already called for the air strike.

49:22.256 --> 49:23.587
Come on! Here we go!

49:26.361 --> 49:28.226
I got you! Go, go, go!

49:30.298 --> 49:31.959
Oh, crap!

49:35.269 --> 49:36.463
Rooftop!

49:39.640 --> 49:41.301
Hey, Duke, I gotta level with you.

49:41.409 --> 49:44.742
-I hate it when you level with me.
-It's going to be a long 5 minutes.

49:50.485 --> 49:53.682
No, no, no! It's too early. It's too early!

49:54.355 --> 49:56.983
-Duke!
-Rex! Rex!

50:17.044 --> 50:18.170
Rex.

50:22.150 --> 50:24.084
Duke! Come on. We gotta go.

50:24.185 --> 50:25.675
-I gotta get Rex.
-We gotta go, man!

50:25.787 --> 50:28.585
Black Hawk's waiting! We gotta go!
Nothing you can do!

50:28.689 --> 50:30.657
-Nothing you can do, man! Come on!
-I gotta get Rex.

50:35.696 --> 50:38.290
Ready. Aim. Fire.

50:39.167 --> 50:40.794
Forward, march.

51:34.088 --> 51:36.215
Are you going to sign in or shall I?

52:00.648 --> 52:01.706
Ana?

52:03.651 --> 52:04.879
Who is this?

52:05.586 --> 52:07.053
Hey! What are you doing?

52:07.154 --> 52:09.088
-What's going on here?
-I need you to do something for me

52:09.190 --> 52:11.021
and I don't have much time.

52:11.726 --> 52:13.455
What are these things?

52:13.561 --> 52:14.960
They're warheads, dear.

52:15.062 --> 52:18.725
And I need you to weaponize them
for me, or we'll kill everyone in here.

52:20.768 --> 52:23.532
Hey! This is a civilian laboratory!

52:24.238 --> 52:26.934
We don't have the correct
programming protocols for weaponizing!

52:27.041 --> 52:31.137
The protocols are in the case.
I told you, I don't have much time.

52:43.391 --> 52:45.188
Hey, is that Dubble Bubble?

52:45.793 --> 52:46.953
But it's my last piece.

52:47.862 --> 52:50.558
-Come on, give it to me.
-All right, there you go.

52:50.665 --> 52:53.600
All right. Stick to the plan.
Scarlett, Snake Eyes, take the front.

52:53.701 --> 52:56.192
Rip, Duke, take the back.
Breaker will be our eyes and ears.

52:56.304 --> 52:57.532
I'll give the orders from here.

52:57.638 --> 53:00.402
-You do what I say, when I say. Got it?
-Yes, Daddy.

53:48.990 --> 53:50.184
Here.

53:50.891 --> 53:53.018
-They're all alive.
-Merci, Daniel.

54:10.544 --> 54:13.445
I told you I'd kill him
if he touched you again.

54:13.814 --> 54:15.805
I heard you the first time.

54:21.489 --> 54:24.420
Okay, we're almost there.
Scarlett, you better put your suit on.

54:34.669 --> 54:35.966
That's her.

54:43.077 --> 54:44.840
Take that Hummer, Snake!

55:09.370 --> 55:11.429
Careful.
They're worth millions of dollars each.

55:11.539 --> 55:13.166
Millions of dollars. Got it.

55:14.508 --> 55:18.103
-Jesus.
-My bad. My bad. Won't happen again!

55:21.615 --> 55:23.014
Thanks a lot, buddy!

55:23.417 --> 55:26.909
Come on, Scarlett, babe. You in or out?
We gotta get in this fight!

55:38.566 --> 55:41.865
Tracking signal is good.
Don't let go of that truck, Snake Eyes.

56:15.035 --> 56:16.730
Let's get that bastard off the roof.

56:45.900 --> 56:47.197
Look out!

56:50.604 --> 56:52.162
Hey, Heavy, it's getting thick out here!

56:52.273 --> 56:54.673
Yeah, I know. They're driving
right into the heaviest traffic.

56:54.775 --> 56:56.299
What kind of escape route is that?

56:56.410 --> 56:59.402
Maybe they're not trying to escape.
Maybe they're heading somewhere.

56:59.513 --> 57:01.310
-Possible target?
-Yes.

57:03.818 --> 57:07.481
Some place with a lot of metal.

57:10.958 --> 57:14.860
-They're going to blow it up. All units!
-Guys, you have to stop them!

57:14.962 --> 57:16.361
Yeah, we're working on it.

57:16.564 --> 57:17.564
I mean right now!

57:17.665 --> 57:20.429
They're going to detonate one
of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower!

57:54.268 --> 57:55.394
Crush him!

57:56.604 --> 57:57.764
Snake!

58:03.611 --> 58:05.203
He's underneath. Kill him!

58:17.491 --> 58:19.959
That redhead is really starting
to piss me off.

58:23.597 --> 58:24.621
Shit!

58:25.733 --> 58:26.927
Oh, God!

58:28.502 --> 58:30.265
I got you. I got you.

58:31.705 --> 58:32.729
-Nice save, slick.
-Come on,

58:32.840 --> 58:35.400
don't start being all nice to me now.
Gotta go.

58:40.080 --> 58:41.240
Get in!

58:45.252 --> 58:48.221
All right, Rip, let's take this thing down!
Hang on, Snake!

58:57.131 --> 58:59.326
Try this on for size, boys.

59:14.214 --> 59:15.374
Oh, shit!

59:34.234 --> 59:35.758
We lost them!

59:36.070 --> 59:37.628
Cut through that building
across the street.

59:37.738 --> 59:39.330
-Where's the door?
-Make one!

59:39.440 --> 59:41.067
Right! Come on, Rip!

59:42.176 --> 59:43.939
I'm coming. I'm coming!

59:45.212 --> 59:47.180
I don't have them! Where are they?

01:00:09.503 --> 01:00:12.097
-They're evacuating the Tower.
-We're only 2 kilometers away.

01:00:12.206 --> 01:00:14.299
Snake, we're running out of time.
You gotta do something.

01:00:14.408 --> 01:00:15.705
It's now or never.

01:00:25.252 --> 01:00:28.244
-He gave up.
-He never gives up.

01:00:41.235 --> 01:00:42.429
Coming through!

01:01:04.324 --> 01:01:06.758
Okay, that was crazy.
I didn't expect that.

01:01:07.861 --> 01:01:10.295
-What happened to you?
-I went through the train.

01:01:10.397 --> 01:01:12.865
-What happened to you?
-I jumped over it.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.326
-You can do that?
-Yeah. I told you to read that manual.

01:01:16.437 --> 01:01:17.870
There's a manual?

01:01:22.009 --> 01:01:24.477
Next time, I'll drive.

01:01:37.524 --> 01:01:39.754
Here. Take the kill switch.

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:51.628
Come on. Get out of the way!

01:01:54.241 --> 01:01:56.402
Hey, guys, they're alive
and they're on the move.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:59.775
And they've activated the warhead.
I'm tracking the kill switch now.

01:02:01.281 --> 01:02:02.475
Duke! Duke, it's on the Baroness!

01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:05.108
Storm Shadow has one of the warheads,
and it's armed!

01:02:15.929 --> 01:02:18.557
Get out of my way! Get out!

01:02:19.566 --> 01:02:20.999
Get out!

01:02:22.269 --> 01:02:23.293
Nice shoes.

01:02:34.081 --> 01:02:35.639
You get the warhead,
I'll get the kill switch.

01:02:35.749 --> 01:02:36.977
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:03:00.007 --> 01:03:01.668
Damn, that ninja's fast!

01:03:05.145 --> 01:03:06.169
No.

01:03:31.138 --> 01:03:32.366
Oh, no!

01:03:45.118 --> 01:03:47.279
-Bloody hell.
-No.

01:04:08.675 --> 01:04:10.040
They're gonna eat through
the entire city.

01:04:10.143 --> 01:04:11.906
Duke, you have to hit that kill switch!

01:04:44.311 --> 01:04:45.972
Oh, God.

01:05:08.769 --> 01:05:09.861
Disarmed.

01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:25.884
Congratulations, Duke.
You just saved Paris.

01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:30.313
Or at least most of it.

01:06:00.287 --> 01:06:03.415
-Is that blood?
-Spaghetti sauce. Don't ask.

01:06:04.358 --> 01:06:06.223
-They got Duke.
-We know.

01:06:06.626 --> 01:06:09.117
-What are you doing?
-Plugging into his cerebral cortex.

01:06:09.229 --> 01:06:10.253
I hate to break the news to you,

01:06:10.364 --> 01:06:12.628
but I don't think he's gonna
give you much in his dead condition.

01:06:12.733 --> 01:06:14.598
The brain survives
a couple of minutes after death.

01:06:14.701 --> 01:06:17.329
We can retrieve the electrical impulses
from his most recent memories

01:06:17.437 --> 01:06:19.530
-and convert them to images.
-Well, can we find Duke?

01:06:19.639 --> 01:06:21.197
We need to find
the other 3 warheads first.

01:06:21.308 --> 01:06:24.471
If this guy remembers his way home,
maybe we can find both.

01:06:25.312 --> 01:06:28.509
Okay, here come the images.
Let's see where this guy's been.

01:06:34.087 --> 01:06:35.111
-He's still alive!
-He can't be.

01:06:35.222 --> 01:06:36.280
He's got 3-inch needles in his head!

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:39.484
-Hey, dead guys don't breakdance!
-What's happening, Breaker?

01:06:39.593 --> 01:06:42.391
-Nanomites, they're eating him.
-Must be some sort of self-destruct.

01:06:42.496 --> 01:06:45.021
-Hurry, Breaker!
-Come on, come on, come on.

01:06:46.633 --> 01:06:48.567
No. No!

01:06:50.737 --> 01:06:52.136
No, no, no!

01:06:53.874 --> 01:06:56.342
The beauty of nanotechnology.

01:06:58.011 --> 01:07:00.206
-We are screwed.
-Relax. I got everything I could.

01:07:00.313 --> 01:07:02.440
What? Then what the hell was the,
"No, no, no, no!" for?

01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:03.709
That was for McCullen.

01:07:03.817 --> 01:07:06.513
-They were watching us.
-Okay. So what did you get?

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:07.985
Actually, not that much. Just images.

01:07:08.088 --> 01:07:09.988
Come on, Frenchie. I thought you said
you was the best at this.

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.387
-I am the best at this!
-All right.

01:07:11.491 --> 01:07:13.015
-Nobody can do what I just did.
-Okay.

01:07:15.629 --> 01:07:16.994
Wait, no.

01:07:17.497 --> 01:07:19.362
We didn't do it. We're the good guys.

01:07:21.101 --> 01:07:22.830
-Put your hands up, Rip.
-We don't have time for this!

01:07:22.936 --> 01:07:24.665
We're not allowed to engage
with friendly forces.

01:07:24.771 --> 01:07:27.672
They don't look too friendly to me.
I gotta get my boy.

01:07:27.774 --> 01:07:29.639
-Look, Captain...
-Rip!

01:07:54.801 --> 01:07:57.031
We're still trying to locate
the 3 remaining warheads, sir.

01:07:57.137 --> 01:07:59.935
-What's the status of the Joes?
-They've been detained.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.498
-The French are pretty upset.
-Of course they're upset.

01:08:05.212 --> 01:08:06.645
Get me the French Ambassador.

01:08:15.188 --> 01:08:17.986
...in a matter of seconds
by a strike by a missile...

01:08:18.091 --> 01:08:19.421
Hey, no, no!

01:08:20.694 --> 01:08:23.720
Please don't touch that!
That's my equipment. It's very...

01:08:24.997 --> 01:08:26.625
Okay, he's touching it.

01:08:27.934 --> 01:08:30.027
-Nice going, slick.
-It's not his fault.

01:08:30.136 --> 01:08:32.229
He's just emotional.

01:08:32.805 --> 01:08:34.899
-Here, let me look at that.
-I'm fine.

01:08:35.008 --> 01:08:37.374
Just trying to help. General!

01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:48.049
The French have agreed to let you all go
on the condition that none of you return.

01:08:49.221 --> 01:08:50.246
Ever.

01:08:50.357 --> 01:08:52.518
-Never?
-It could be worse.

01:08:52.626 --> 01:08:54.252
What do you mean by never?
Like, never, never, ever?

01:08:54.361 --> 01:08:55.828
There's more.

01:08:55.929 --> 01:08:59.490
All of you have been recalled
by your respective heads of state.

01:08:59.599 --> 01:09:01.999
Team Alpha is to return to the Pit.

01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:04.928
What about Duke?

01:09:11.845 --> 01:09:14.143
Call McCullen.
Tell him we have the 3 warheads.

01:09:14.247 --> 01:09:15.475
Right away.

01:09:18.018 --> 01:09:19.986
Why didn't you just kill me?

01:09:20.086 --> 01:09:22.953
McCullen has something special
in mind for you.

01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:24.250
McCullen.

01:09:26.393 --> 01:09:27.917
What happened to you?

01:09:28.028 --> 01:09:29.393
Now you care?

01:09:30.796 --> 01:09:31.854
Okay.

01:09:33.233 --> 01:09:34.598
I am sorry.

01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:37.770
I'm sorry about Rex.

01:09:38.505 --> 01:09:41.099
I'm sorry that I couldn't bring Rex home.

01:09:42.042 --> 01:09:45.011
And I'm so sorry
that I couldn't face you afterwards.

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.845
Well, everybody's sorry
about something.

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:57.948
Master!

01:10:58.518 --> 01:10:59.712
Master.

01:11:21.408 --> 01:11:23.672
Okay, so what about Duke?
We're just gonna forget about him?

01:11:23.777 --> 01:11:24.971
We've got our orders.

01:11:25.078 --> 01:11:27.012
Look, man,
what if it was one of your guys?

01:11:27.113 --> 01:11:29.604
What if it was Scarlett or Breaker?
What would you do then?

01:11:29.716 --> 01:11:32.082
Looks pretty remote.
Might be a good location for a base.

01:11:32.185 --> 01:11:34.949
Snow. That leaves us with what,
1/3 of the earth?

01:11:35.055 --> 01:11:36.215
Yeah.

01:11:38.425 --> 01:11:40.757
-Hey, is that McCullen's shadow?
-What you got?

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.226
-Spherical trigonometry.
-I must have missed that class.

01:11:43.329 --> 01:11:45.297
If you know the height of the object,
the length of the shadow,

01:11:45.398 --> 01:11:46.831
and the time and date
that the image was captured,

01:11:46.933 --> 01:11:49.128
-you can figure out its location.
-That's why I missed that class.

01:11:49.235 --> 01:11:50.998
All right, Breaker, give it to me.
What have we got?

01:11:51.104 --> 01:11:56.303
Okay. McCullen is 180 centimeters tall.
His shadow is 46 centimeters.

01:11:56.409 --> 01:11:58.138
This image has decayed 6%,

01:11:58.244 --> 01:12:01.611
which means
it's 51 hours and 17 minutes old.

01:12:02.148 --> 01:12:03.979
That's at the polar icecap.

01:12:04.084 --> 01:12:05.608
-Heavy.
-Yep.

01:12:07.353 --> 01:12:08.353
What do you say, sir?

01:12:08.421 --> 01:12:10.685
I said you've been ordered back
to the Pit,

01:12:11.825 --> 01:12:14.988
but I didn't say when
and I didn't say which route to take.

01:12:18.131 --> 01:12:19.621
Maybe a northern one.

01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:38.508
That is a lot of ice.

01:12:38.618 --> 01:12:40.950
Thousands of miles across
and 10 stories thick.

01:12:41.054 --> 01:12:43.989
Locating McCullen's base will be
like finding a needle in a coal mine.

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:46.115
-Haystack.
-Right.

01:12:46.593 --> 01:12:48.254
Haystack in a coal mine.

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:39.269
No! McCullen has plans for him!

01:13:46.553 --> 01:13:47.747
Enough!

01:14:01.835 --> 01:14:03.359
And what was your plan?

01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:06.404
Run 3,000 miles across the ice?

01:14:11.611 --> 01:14:13.101
Stupid soldier.

01:14:21.588 --> 01:14:22.987
Move it.

01:14:23.456 --> 01:14:25.321
-That's strange.
-What?

01:14:25.658 --> 01:14:28.354
When they stole the weapons case,
I set my scanner

01:14:28.461 --> 01:14:31.726
to look out for the tracking beacon
in case it came back on.

01:14:31.831 --> 01:14:34.595
-And it just came back on.
-That's my boy!

01:14:55.688 --> 01:14:56.712
3 left.

01:14:56.823 --> 01:15:00.589
Take the warheads to the missiles.
I want them ready to launch in one hour.

01:15:00.827 --> 01:15:02.351
It will be done.

01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:12.538
My beautiful Lady of the Lake.

01:15:21.114 --> 01:15:22.706
This bother you?

01:15:24.384 --> 01:15:28.514
It's funny, isn't it? The entire balance
of power in the world about to shift,

01:15:28.621 --> 01:15:32.022
2 guys can still have a stare-down
over who gets the girl.

01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:51.669
I'm gonna make you very unhappy.

01:15:51.778 --> 01:15:53.746
-I'm already unhappy.
-Get up!

01:16:06.092 --> 01:16:08.686
Video from the Aqua Cam
is coming online now.

01:16:09.228 --> 01:16:10.661
Bloody hell.

01:16:10.997 --> 01:16:14.023
They've built a military base
under the polar icecap.

01:16:14.133 --> 01:16:17.034
It's the perfect location.
Nearly undetectable, easily defensible.

01:16:17.136 --> 01:16:19.696
-Duke's got to be in there somewhere.
-And the warheads.

01:16:19.806 --> 01:16:21.899
We have to find a quiet way
to get inside.

01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:27.174
Elevator cables.
They've got a surface entrance.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:31.512
Guys, there's something else.
Going to sonar view.

01:16:32.218 --> 01:16:34.516
They've got tunnels
running through the ice pack.

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:36.884
Hey, look, they've got
their own attack subs.

01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:38.480
Okay, what's that?

01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:41.253
-Missile tubes.
-Must be for the nanomite warheads.

01:16:41.361 --> 01:16:44.626
Take us up. I'll create a distraction
from outside and keep them busy

01:16:44.731 --> 01:16:47.325
while you lot infiltrate the facility
from above. We'll find Duke...

01:16:47.433 --> 01:16:48.957
-Grab the warheads.
-Kill all the bad guys.

01:16:49.869 --> 01:16:53.066
As you all know,
Team Alpha is under direct orders

01:16:53.172 --> 01:16:55.606
to return to their
respective national bases.

01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:59.735
But I have something I need to do
which goes against all orders.

01:17:00.713 --> 01:17:03.443
So, if any of you decide
that you have to leave now,

01:17:03.549 --> 01:17:06.313
I will certainly not hold it against you.

01:17:16.329 --> 01:17:17.353
Okay, then.

01:17:18.564 --> 01:17:19.724
What are you gonna do
with the warheads?

01:17:19.832 --> 01:17:22.528
You take to your training well.
That's good.

01:17:22.635 --> 01:17:24.398
Still trying to develop intel.

01:17:24.504 --> 01:17:26.699
-So you won't mind telling me.
-Isn't it obvious?

01:17:26.806 --> 01:17:29.001
I'm a businessman.
I'm going to use them.

01:17:29.108 --> 01:17:31.570
Millions of people are gonna die
if you launch those warheads,

01:17:31.677 --> 01:17:32.701
so what is it that you want?

01:17:32.812 --> 01:17:36.942
To strike fear into the hearts of every
man, woman and child on the planet.

01:17:37.617 --> 01:17:39.847
Then they'll turn to the person
with the most power.

01:17:39.952 --> 01:17:41.010
You?

01:17:41.687 --> 01:17:43.177
No, not me.

01:17:43.289 --> 01:17:45.450
-You're not seeing the whole picture.
-Then tell me.

01:17:45.558 --> 01:17:47.583
I don't wanna spoil the surprise.

01:17:58.004 --> 01:17:59.004
Guests.

01:17:59.105 --> 01:18:01.938
Meet the genius
behind all my nanotechnology.

01:18:02.041 --> 01:18:04.771
Genius? You are too kind.

01:18:05.244 --> 01:18:08.372
As you can see,
we are loading my nanomite warheads

01:18:08.481 --> 01:18:10.312
into the high-V missiles.

01:18:10.416 --> 01:18:13.146
Once at maximum velocity, Mach 5,

01:18:13.519 --> 01:18:16.716
not even the Joes have
the technology to catch them.

01:18:16.823 --> 01:18:19.917
So, who's this? Another recruit?

01:18:20.927 --> 01:18:22.918
Albeit a rather unwilling one.

01:18:23.029 --> 01:18:25.463
I'll prepare him for the procedure.

01:18:46.686 --> 01:18:49.314
All teams, listen up,
this is General Hawk.

01:18:49.422 --> 01:18:52.516
The mission is a go.
I say again, the mission is a go.

01:18:53.226 --> 01:18:54.226
Good luck, Joes.

01:19:24.557 --> 01:19:27.117
-The teams have been deployed, sir.
-Get me a satellite uplink.

01:19:27.226 --> 01:19:29.694
I wanna see everything
that's going on down there.

01:19:42.542 --> 01:19:43.702
You picking up anything?

01:19:43.809 --> 01:19:46.175
Negative.
There's nothing on the scanner.

01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:00.520
-Nice shooting.
-Thank you.

01:20:02.428 --> 01:20:04.157
We're a long way from Miami.

01:20:05.598 --> 01:20:08.431
That's a Night Raven.
They actually built one.

01:20:08.534 --> 01:20:11.094
Looks fast.
That McCullen got some gadgets.

01:20:12.505 --> 01:20:17.943
MARS Industries manufactures
70% of all arms on this planet.

01:20:18.344 --> 01:20:20.039
70%.

01:20:21.113 --> 01:20:24.139
Did you know that, Duke?

01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:29.551
There are 2 sides to McCullen's operation,
the Sword and the Shield.

01:20:29.922 --> 01:20:32.390
The Sword creates and sells weaponry.

01:20:32.491 --> 01:20:36.894
The Shield creates defensive
technology, like high-tech bunkers,

01:20:36.996 --> 01:20:39.055
which are supposed
to protect one from anything

01:20:39.165 --> 01:20:42.066
from a nuclear blast
to a nanomite warhead.

01:20:42.168 --> 01:20:46.400
Unfortunately, the bunker
in which I took shelter

01:20:46.505 --> 01:20:48.200
was just a prototype.

01:20:48.307 --> 01:20:49.740
Who are you?

01:21:02.455 --> 01:21:03.683
Rex?

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:07.384
You son of a bitch! Ana buried you!

01:21:07.493 --> 01:21:09.927
Moving ceremony, I'm sure.

01:21:10.029 --> 01:21:12.088
The 3-volley salute.

01:21:12.198 --> 01:21:15.190
Boots on the ground.
A folded flag in her arms.

01:21:15.301 --> 01:21:17.735
Why? Why didn't you just come in?

01:21:17.837 --> 01:21:20.772
Because I discovered something.

01:21:23.976 --> 01:21:26.308
...subject number 23.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.080
This will only hurt a little.

01:21:30.182 --> 01:21:32.582
What comes next, more so.

01:21:32.685 --> 01:21:35.153
Listen, Mindbender,
do whatever it takes.

01:21:35.254 --> 01:21:36.721
So will I.

01:21:36.822 --> 01:21:40.087
Remember, science requires sacrifice.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.828
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Stay where you are!

01:21:45.264 --> 01:21:47.027
Are you going to shoot me?

01:21:49.368 --> 01:21:52.269
These aren't chemical or nuclear,
are they?

01:21:52.371 --> 01:21:53.531
No.

01:21:53.639 --> 01:21:55.937
They're something much, much better.

01:21:56.042 --> 01:21:57.407
It is beautiful.

01:21:59.445 --> 01:22:01.777
Nanomites, it's beyond...

01:22:02.281 --> 01:22:04.715
It's light years ahead
of what anyone else is doing in the field.

01:22:05.418 --> 01:22:06.908
Proximity alert.

01:22:07.019 --> 01:22:10.716
Aerial attack imminent.
All personnel to the bunker.

01:22:15.394 --> 01:22:18.056
Come on. Come on! What?

01:22:18.164 --> 01:22:20.496
What are you doing?
Don't close that. Don't...

01:22:21.934 --> 01:22:25.199
If we live, I'll show you everything.

01:22:29.909 --> 01:22:33.811
We survived that blast, somewhat.

01:22:33.913 --> 01:22:38.213
And Dr. Mindbender and I escaped
with his research, which I perfected

01:22:38.317 --> 01:22:41.377
and which you will
now experience first-hand.

01:22:41.487 --> 01:22:43.751
Does Ana know about this? About you?

01:22:43.856 --> 01:22:46.416
No, and she never will.

01:22:48.994 --> 01:22:50.552
Commence the launch sequence.

01:22:50.663 --> 01:22:56.226
Commencing launch sequence.
T-minus 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:58.102
Ignite primary engines.

01:22:59.672 --> 01:23:01.264
We have ignition.

01:23:07.079 --> 01:23:08.876
They're launching the missiles!

01:23:45.151 --> 01:23:48.416
We lost the Beijing missile.
Warhead 3 is down, sir.

01:23:48.521 --> 01:23:50.546
-Alert all defenses.
-Yes, sir.

01:23:50.656 --> 01:23:51.953
He's here.

01:24:03.569 --> 01:24:05.935
-What about the other two?
-We gotta find the kill switches.

01:24:06.038 --> 01:24:07.198
They're already way too far out of range.

01:24:07.306 --> 01:24:10.002
Somebody has to get up there
and shoot those things down.

01:24:10.109 --> 01:24:13.408
Well, I guess that's me.

01:24:14.213 --> 01:24:15.510
-Sir.
-What is it?

01:24:15.614 --> 01:24:17.548
STRATCOM is tracking 3 warheads

01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:19.413
that have just launched off
the polar icecap.

01:24:19.518 --> 01:24:20.518
One was downed immediately.

01:24:20.619 --> 01:24:22.519
The other 2 are currently entering
the upper atmosphere.

01:24:22.621 --> 01:24:24.054
We need to get you
down to the bunker, sir.

01:24:24.156 --> 01:24:26.818
Well, they haven't made any demands.
What's their plan?

01:24:29.195 --> 01:24:31.186
Now, this is very cool.

01:24:31.697 --> 01:24:33.995
-Yeah, but can you fly it?
-I can fly anything.

01:24:34.099 --> 01:24:36.624
You just find a way
to guide me to those warheads.

01:24:36.735 --> 01:24:38.999
-Right. Ripcord...
-Yeah?

01:24:41.907 --> 01:24:43.670
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

01:24:44.043 --> 01:24:45.772
-Hey, do me a favor.
-Yeah?

01:24:45.878 --> 01:24:47.937
-Save Duke.
-You got it.

01:24:57.523 --> 01:24:58.785
Let's go!

01:25:10.135 --> 01:25:12.433
The floor is pressure-plated
and laser-protected.

01:25:12.538 --> 01:25:15.735
Anything larger than a quarter
that touches that floor gets fried.

01:25:18.777 --> 01:25:22.975
You left me for dead, Duke,
and look at me.

01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:26.743
Now you'll know what it's like
to be a monster.

01:25:34.193 --> 01:25:36.093
-We don't have much time.
-Ana?

01:25:45.971 --> 01:25:47.461
Oh, my God.

01:25:49.308 --> 01:25:51.868
-Ana!
-Security, to the operating chamber!

01:25:51.977 --> 01:25:54.502
-Rex!
-I press this, she dies.

01:25:54.613 --> 01:25:57.844
-You did this to your own sister!
-I loved my sister.

01:25:57.950 --> 01:26:01.852
Do you have any idea the state
she was in with me dead, you gone?

01:26:03.155 --> 01:26:06.124
Have you ever felt truly alone?

01:26:07.059 --> 01:26:11.086
I gave her a way to deal with the pain.
I gave her purpose.

01:26:11.297 --> 01:26:14.130
You could have stopped all of this
just by letting her know you were alive!

01:26:14.233 --> 01:26:16.428
Science requires sacrifice.

01:26:16.535 --> 01:26:18.969
All she's done was because of you!

01:26:19.071 --> 01:26:22.165
And because of you, Duke.
You abandoned her.

01:26:22.274 --> 01:26:25.471
-Let's not forget that point.
-I'm gonna kill you, Rex.

01:26:30.115 --> 01:26:32.140
-Is she still alive?
-For now.

01:26:32.251 --> 01:26:34.913
I thought we had complete control.
You said this couldn't happen.

01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:36.044
I didn't think it could.

01:26:36.155 --> 01:26:39.784
I've never seen anyone override
the programming, even momentarily.

01:26:39.892 --> 01:26:41.621
She did this for him.

01:26:42.227 --> 01:26:45.788
The pain must have been excruciating.

01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:55.932
What you'll have to do

01:26:56.041 --> 01:26:59.704
is to rewire the laser panel's brain
by carefully...

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:03.778
-Or you can just stab it.
-This is Scarlett. We're in.

01:27:04.683 --> 01:27:05.707
Deploy the SHARCs!

01:27:06.485 --> 01:27:07.747
Detaching SHARCs 1-3...

01:27:07.853 --> 01:27:10.754
Detaching SHARCs
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta.

01:27:10.856 --> 01:27:13.347
-Full speed ahead.
-Detaching SHARCs.

01:27:13.459 --> 01:27:16.860
SHARCs Victor, Franklin, Tango
into flanking positions.

01:27:16.962 --> 01:27:19.294
All right, boys. Attack formation.

01:27:32.711 --> 01:27:35.305
Fan out.
Wait until the Joes break formation.

01:27:35.714 --> 01:27:38.444
Stay tight. Here they come.

01:28:01.006 --> 01:28:03.406
-Fire up the pulse cannon!
-We're on it, sir.

01:28:06.845 --> 01:28:08.244
-I'll do it!
-Put it down!

01:28:08.347 --> 01:28:09.837
Your choice, Duke.

01:28:10.582 --> 01:28:12.174
Charging pulse cannon.

01:28:24.763 --> 01:28:26.458
Everybody stay tight on the enemy craft.

01:28:26.565 --> 01:28:28.430
Don't let that cannon catch you
out in the open.

01:28:28.534 --> 01:28:30.229
Bogey at 10 o'clock.

01:28:30.335 --> 01:28:32.064
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

01:28:33.172 --> 01:28:36.835
Missile 2, all telemetry
and propulsion systems nominal.

01:29:04.837 --> 01:29:07.067
-Ripcord, can you hear me?
-Loud and clear, buddy.

01:29:07.172 --> 01:29:09.299
Doing Mach 6 and loving it!

01:29:10.175 --> 01:29:12.143
Come on, girl.
Time to show me what you got.

01:29:14.747 --> 01:29:17.648
Okay, Rip, I have the coordinates
of the other 2 warheads.

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:20.412
The closest target is Moscow.
You'll have to hit that one first.

01:29:20.519 --> 01:29:22.009
Target 2 is Washington.

01:29:26.325 --> 01:29:27.724
You'll be safe down in this bunker, sir.

01:29:27.826 --> 01:29:30.556
-How soon before it strikes the city?
-17 minutes, sir.

01:29:30.662 --> 01:29:33.062
-It's all up to the Joes now.
-Please hurry, Mr. President.

01:29:33.165 --> 01:29:34.860
We need to get you buttoned up.

01:29:52.951 --> 01:29:55.818
General Hawk, we've lost our engines.
We're completely disabled.

01:29:55.921 --> 01:29:59.015
Somebody take out that damn cannon.
There's 200 Joes on that sub.

01:29:59.124 --> 01:30:01.058
We're on it, sir. All right, Snake,

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.457
the cannon control room
should be right there,

01:30:02.561 --> 01:30:04.461
where all the laser conduits converge.

01:30:05.464 --> 01:30:09.025
Did you think she loved you?
Did you imagine your life with her?

01:30:09.535 --> 01:30:11.400
All I know is,
neither one of you deserve her.

01:30:11.503 --> 01:30:13.994
-That's it. She dies!
-Don't do it, Rex!

01:30:27.019 --> 01:30:28.281
Come on.

01:30:30.589 --> 01:30:31.817
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:30:33.859 --> 01:30:34.985
Get up!

01:30:35.627 --> 01:30:37.288
You're coming with me.

01:30:53.545 --> 01:30:56.912
Ripcord, the Moscow missile
will impact in 4 minutes.

01:30:57.015 --> 01:30:58.505
All right, I got a visual on it.

01:30:59.017 --> 01:31:00.143
Dead ahead.

01:31:01.086 --> 01:31:03.350
You have to knock it down
before it re-enters the atmosphere.

01:31:03.455 --> 01:31:05.150
If those nanomites hit the ground,
it's all over.

01:31:05.324 --> 01:31:06.621
They'll destroy the whole city.

01:31:06.725 --> 01:31:08.249
Houston, we have a problem.

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.659
-The fire controls are not in here.
-What do you mean, not in there?

01:31:11.997 --> 01:31:13.658
I mean, I don't see them anywhere.

01:31:14.533 --> 01:31:15.898
It must be voice-activated.

01:31:16.001 --> 01:31:17.229
Okay. Fire!

01:31:19.238 --> 01:31:22.332
Shoot! Blast away! Bust a cap!

01:31:23.909 --> 01:31:27.003
-Nothing's happening!
-I bet it's in a different language.

01:31:27.112 --> 01:31:30.275
Wait a minute. McCullen is Scottish.
Maybe the plane responds to Celtic.

01:31:30.382 --> 01:31:33.442
-Try Teine.
-What?

01:31:33.552 --> 01:31:37.420
-Teine. It's Celt, Scottish for fire.
-Okay, got it.

01:31:46.365 --> 01:31:48.731
Nice going, ace.
You just saved Moscow.

01:31:48.834 --> 01:31:51.598
Just doing my job.
Now guide me to Washington.

01:31:57.976 --> 01:32:01.070
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, that's great news.
I'll let him know.

01:32:01.179 --> 01:32:04.012
Sir, one of the Joes shot down
the warhead heading for Moscow.

01:32:04.116 --> 01:32:05.413
Thank God.

01:32:10.088 --> 01:32:12.352
What are you doing? Oh, my God!

01:32:17.562 --> 01:32:18.927
It's done.

01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:35.641
Hello, Mr. President.
Mr. McCullen sends his regards.

01:32:36.515 --> 01:32:37.948
Oh, my God.

01:32:39.885 --> 01:32:41.614
So, that's what this is all about.

01:32:44.122 --> 01:32:46.090
All right. Keep tight, boys.

01:32:46.191 --> 01:32:49.058
All guns on that cannon.
Torpedoes away!

01:33:00.872 --> 01:33:01.998
I've just lost my wingman.

01:33:02.107 --> 01:33:04.166
Retargeting Joe submarine.

01:33:06.678 --> 01:33:08.236
I've got a shot.

01:33:29.067 --> 01:33:32.332
Pulse cannon fault. Pulse cannon fault.

01:33:33.005 --> 01:33:35.030
Cannon now offline.

01:33:45.384 --> 01:33:48.683
-The whole damn system's down.
-I'm trying to bring it back online.

01:33:55.694 --> 01:33:56.752
Now you die.

01:34:19.718 --> 01:34:20.980
Launch immediately.

01:34:21.086 --> 01:34:23.077
-Chart a course up to the ice pack.
-Yes, sir.

01:34:38.637 --> 01:34:41.105
-We gotta go after Rex and McCullen.
-How could it be Rex?

01:34:42.707 --> 01:34:44.572
Hey, Scarlett, it's Duke!

01:34:44.676 --> 01:34:46.303
-He looks fine.
-But what's he doing with her?

01:34:58.557 --> 01:35:01.685
Okay, we got a track on McCullen's sub.
He's headed up into the ice pack.

01:35:04.796 --> 01:35:05.922
Duke, behind us!

01:35:09.668 --> 01:35:11.829
Looks like they're onto us.
Ana, shoot those guys.

01:35:11.937 --> 01:35:12.995
Love to.

01:35:57.315 --> 01:36:01.012
When our master was killed,
you took a vow of silence.

01:36:01.786 --> 01:36:04.084
Now you will die without a word.

01:36:08.093 --> 01:36:10.425
All right, the second one in my sights.

01:36:10.529 --> 01:36:13.726
Okay, Rip, you only got 30 seconds
before it enters the lower atmosphere.

01:36:26.912 --> 01:36:28.004
I got you!

01:36:36.221 --> 01:36:37.711
-Ripcord, you missed.
-The warhead has entered

01:36:37.822 --> 01:36:38.822
the lower atmosphere.

01:36:38.924 --> 01:36:40.892
I know, I know! I'm on it, I'm on it!

01:36:44.796 --> 01:36:45.854
Shit!

01:36:47.999 --> 01:36:50.263
-I can't shake these guys.
-Duke, I'm out!

01:36:50.635 --> 01:36:53.229
-All right, let's see what we got here.
-Black Ray, Eliminator, LAW.

01:36:53.338 --> 01:36:56.000
Laser Artillery Weapon.
That sounds good.

01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:03.574
-Scarlett!
-Hey, Duke!

01:37:03.682 --> 01:37:04.740
I'm going after McCullen and Rex.

01:37:04.849 --> 01:37:05.907
You guys better get the hell out of there.

01:37:06.017 --> 01:37:08.042
I can't. Rip has one more warhead
to take down.

01:37:08.153 --> 01:37:09.153
Rip, where is he?

01:37:16.494 --> 01:37:19.292
The missile's just gone drone.
It's going in for the kill!

01:38:21.359 --> 01:38:23.793
Sir, there's a hostile Mantis craft
coming up behind us.

01:38:23.895 --> 01:38:25.192
-Seal the door.
-Sir.

01:38:31.636 --> 01:38:33.126
There you are.

01:38:43.081 --> 01:38:44.946
One got through. I hit them!

01:38:47.652 --> 01:38:49.449
Duke! They're back!

01:38:53.358 --> 01:38:55.690
Going hot in 3, 2, 1.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.102
There's gotta be another way around
to Rex and McCullen.

01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:13.541
Charting new course for alternate route.

01:39:21.619 --> 01:39:23.610
20 seconds until impact.

01:39:23.722 --> 01:39:25.212
Come on, come on, come on.

01:39:28.626 --> 01:39:30.253
You're too close, Rip! Back off!

01:39:30.362 --> 01:39:34.389
Actually, I think
I'm just about close enough.

01:39:52.117 --> 01:39:53.948
He's taking the nanomites
back into the upper atmosphere.

01:40:03.795 --> 01:40:06.161
Ripcord, get out of that plane!

01:40:06.264 --> 01:40:07.959
Almost there!

01:40:10.602 --> 01:40:12.331
Eject, Ripcord, eject!

01:40:22.547 --> 01:40:25.038
He did it. He actually did it.

01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:26.810
Ripcord?

01:40:29.354 --> 01:40:30.685
Ripcord?

01:40:33.224 --> 01:40:34.282
Ripcord!

01:40:34.392 --> 01:40:36.383
Didn't I ask you not to yell at me?

01:40:38.997 --> 01:40:43.195
Everybody, listen up! We still have
a lot of Joes out there in harm's way.

01:40:43.301 --> 01:40:44.427
Let's bring them home.

01:40:47.839 --> 01:40:50.467
-Did it work?
-Yes, yes, it worked.

01:40:51.810 --> 01:40:55.576
Good. Because I think
I'm about to get arrested, again.

01:40:57.182 --> 01:40:58.182
Don't move!

01:40:58.283 --> 01:40:59.841
-Hey, hey, same team, same team!
-Hands up!

01:40:59.951 --> 01:41:01.612
Same team.

01:41:01.719 --> 01:41:03.346
Okay, okay, okay.

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:12.088
-What's our status?
-We've lost aft thrusters and the sonar.

01:41:12.197 --> 01:41:15.826
-We're running blind.
-Kill them. Kill all the Joes.

01:41:15.934 --> 01:41:18.801
-Detonate the ice pack.
-Right away, sir.

01:41:27.111 --> 01:41:30.239
They're telling the other ships to abort.
He's gonna blow the ice pack.

01:41:30.348 --> 01:41:32.942
This is Duke calling all Joes.
The ice pack's coming down!

01:41:33.051 --> 01:41:34.211
There's a ton of steel and ice

01:41:34.319 --> 01:41:35.319
-headed your way!
-What?

01:41:39.357 --> 01:41:42.053
Everybody, pull back! Pull back now!

01:41:48.333 --> 01:41:50.426
Door! The door, the door! Get the door!

01:41:53.805 --> 01:41:55.067
Come on!

01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:05.916
Ana, we could get out of here right now,
free and clear, safe and sound.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:11.914
-Let's get them.
-That's my girl.

01:42:25.036 --> 01:42:27.869
-This is cutting it close, Duke.
-I'm not letting those 2 get away.

01:42:31.042 --> 01:42:32.703
Come on, guys, get out of there!

01:42:40.652 --> 01:42:41.949
Snake!

01:43:22.093 --> 01:43:24.960
-This is Scarlett. We're all clear.
-This is Duke. We're clear, too.

01:43:25.063 --> 01:43:26.690
Yo, Joe!

01:43:32.737 --> 01:43:34.102
Yeah!

01:43:51.522 --> 01:43:54.116
Now that we have
a moment to ourselves,

01:43:55.093 --> 01:43:56.526
I've designed something

01:43:56.628 --> 01:43:59.597
-especially for you, James.
-No!

01:44:01.165 --> 01:44:03.099
This will only hurt a little.

01:44:04.936 --> 01:44:08.372
What comes next, more so.

01:44:13.444 --> 01:44:16.777
Nanomites, perfect little healers.

01:44:30.395 --> 01:44:34.092
I've finally taken my place
in a long line of McCullens.

01:44:34.198 --> 01:44:40.398
James McCullen is no more.
Now you are Destro.

01:44:42.674 --> 01:44:44.835
What have you done to me?

01:44:52.450 --> 01:44:57.979
The time has come for the cobra
to rise up and reveal himself.

01:45:00.792 --> 01:45:05.092
You will call me Commander.

01:45:16.708 --> 01:45:19.506
This is Captain Duke Hauser.
Prepare to be boarded.

01:45:21.479 --> 01:45:22.571
Sir.

01:45:25.349 --> 01:45:28.978
You are relentless, Duke.
I'll give you that much.

01:45:30.088 --> 01:45:33.854
And what's to stop me
from blowing you out of the water?

01:45:33.958 --> 01:45:37.325
Self-preservation. I'm taking you in, Rex.

01:45:41.165 --> 01:45:42.996
You and what army?

01:45:44.402 --> 01:45:45.664
My army.

01:46:01.719 --> 01:46:05.177
You know, Duke,
this has only just begun.

01:46:10.995 --> 01:46:12.622
I'll be waiting for you.

01:46:25.076 --> 01:46:27.909
I've never seen encoding like this.
I mean, physically, she's fine,

01:46:28.012 --> 01:46:30.640
but when Rex programmed them,
he sure didn't want them taken out.

01:46:30.748 --> 01:46:33.080
-So there's nothing you can do for her?
-It'll take some time,

01:46:33.184 --> 01:46:35.084
but we'll take them out.

01:46:40.057 --> 01:46:41.649
Till we get those things
out of your head,

01:46:41.759 --> 01:46:43.818
looks like you're gonna be
seeing a lot of me around here.

01:46:43.928 --> 01:46:47.989
You can't save me, Duke.
No one can, not after all I've done.

01:46:48.566 --> 01:46:50.431
Look, that wasn't you.

01:46:53.304 --> 01:46:55.135
I'm not giving up on you.

01:47:29.407 --> 01:47:32.001
-Man, we look good.
-Yeah, well, you better get used to it.

01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:34.873
Heavy Duty thinks you guys
ought to stick around permanently.

01:47:34.979 --> 01:47:36.173
So, you're asking us, right?

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.372
Yeah, 'cause he didn't sound
like he was asking.

01:47:37.481 --> 01:47:38.607
'Cause you gotta be asked
to join the G.I. Joes.

01:47:38.716 --> 01:47:40.013
I'm asking.

01:47:40.551 --> 01:47:41.609
Well, I'm in.

01:47:41.719 --> 01:47:45.985
-How do you feel about this?
-I feel very emotional.

01:47:46.891 --> 01:47:50.349
All Joes mobilize and ready check
for Operation Mongoose.

01:47:50.461 --> 01:47:53.726
All ground transports,
rendezvous at Base Brothers Grimm.

01:47:53.831 --> 01:47:56.732
All Howler Hunters will rendezvous
at Base Roman Ruin.

01:47:56.834 --> 01:47:58.392
Good luck, Joes.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.800
Subtitles: Sickness

01:48:30.368 --> 01:48:32.427
Mr. President, it's good to see you.

01:48:32.536 --> 01:48:34.401
-Thank you. And you.
-It's nice to have you back safely, sir.

01:48:34.505 --> 01:48:36.097
-Thank you. John.
-Welcome back, sir.

01:48:36.207 --> 01:48:39.142
Thank you. Thank you all so much.
