00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Ever wonder what people are thinking?

00:04.001 --> 00:05.666
I don't. I know.

00:08.902 --> 00:11.602
The secret isn't in hearing people's thoughts.

00:13.203 --> 00:15.003
The secret is making it stop.

00:21.004 --> 00:23.604
I've been doing both for as
long as I can remember.

00:26.271 --> 00:28.532
Way before I ever heard the word telepath.

00:33.451 --> 00:35.931
Still, when God hooked you up with free Cable (television),

00:35.932 --> 00:38.371
You gotta think he expects
you to do a little service.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.165
Hmm... If he could only read my mind.

00:42.255 --> 00:43.720
I should've worn something else.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:54.764 --> 00:55.909
I need another buck.

01:00.087 --> 01:02.823
This here is on the floor, is it yours?

01:06.898 --> 01:07.528
Hey.

01:08.212 --> 01:10.867
Hey. You're late. I had to eat.

01:10.889 --> 01:11.868
So what else is new?

01:11.869 --> 01:12.869
We gotta go.

01:12.870 --> 01:14.370
Can I get a cup of coffee?

01:13.871 --> 01:14.871
Have mine.

01:14.872 --> 01:16.800
So, were you with Olivia last night?

01:16.901 --> 01:18.201
For a while, yeah.

01:18.002 --> 01:21.648
Oh, that's why you slept in.
- No, my alarm didn’t' go off.

01:21.703 --> 01:24.924
You know, they say insomnia is a common ailment for first-year paramedics.

01:25.025 --> 01:26.325
I don't have insomnia.

01:26.334 --> 01:27.210
So it's girl troubles.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.689
I don't have girl troubles either.

01:28.690 --> 01:30.979
Come on, you and Olivia get in
another fight last night?

01:30.980 --> 01:31.980
I thought we were late.

01:31.981 --> 01:33.781
Oh, we're late.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.472
That's not bad.

01:35.624 --> 01:37.706
I don't tell many people about my gift.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.677
I'm not into being the freak show at the party.

01:40.901 --> 01:41.896
Have a good day.

01:44.777 --> 01:47.055
Besides, who's gonna believe me anyway?

01:50.730 --> 01:53.244
You got any plans tonight?
- No. You?

01:54.669 --> 01:55.639
No.

01:56.740 --> 02:00.188
Who are you texting over there?
You've got another fight with Olivia.

02:00.189 --> 02:01.189
No.

02:01.190 --> 02:03.543
Olivia and I, we don't fight. We ******

02:03.944 --> 02:06.649
Well, why don't you two just give it up?

02:06.650 --> 02:09.483
We like hanging out together. Okay?

02:09.783 --> 02:10.751
Did I say anything?

02:10.752 --> 02:14.274
Is that cool with you?
-Sure, it's your business, man.

02:18.176 --> 02:20.279
No!

02:20.887 --> 02:22.091
Toby, you okay?

02:26.594 --> 02:29.164
Toby, look at me! Hey, look at me.

02:30.188 --> 02:31.065
Is it a migraine?

02:31.066 --> 02:32.066
I don't get migraines.

02:33.041 --> 02:35.103
You could've been having a
brain aneurism, I don't know.

02:35.993 --> 02:38.615
You know, in the paper, that 22 year
old swimmer just had a brain tumor.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.359
Oz, stop. Please.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.360
I'm okay.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.361
I'll be okay.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.362
Yeah?
-Yes.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.363
Okay.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.146
You gotta get yourself checked out.

02:46.147 --> 02:48.246
It's a little too intense for me.

02:48.247 --> 02:49.247
I know.

02:50.973 --> 02:52.221
Wow...

02:53.970 --> 02:54.917
What?

03:05.003 --> 03:07.649
Is someone in there?
- Yeah, I don't think she's conscious.

03:09.302 --> 03:10.279
Hey, get the door.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.280
Ma'am!

03:12.582 --> 03:13.677
Hey, can you hear me?

03:13.678 --> 03:14.978
We'll get you out!

03:14.979 --> 03:15.979
She's conscious, Oz!

03:15.980 --> 03:17.815
What about those doors?
- No, they won't budge!

03:20.377 --> 03:21.141
Ah, Toby!

03:21.542 --> 03:22.642
We've gotta move!

03:22.043 --> 03:24.643
Look what I found.
-Toby, this car is on fire.

03:25.401 --> 03:27.265
Move your head! I need to break the window!

03:35.535 --> 03:37.613
Careful, Toby. Careful.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.596
We don't have much time, Toby, hurry.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.896
Are you okay?

03:44.897 --> 03:47.109
You've got her?
- Yeah, yeah. Come on!

03:47.915 --> 03:49.482
I was sure it was gonna blow.

03:49.257 --> 03:51.213
It's not a movie, Oz.
It doesn't happen that way.

04:16.332 --> 04:28.509
Season 01 Episode 01
"I Am An Adult"

04:36.189 --> 04:39.474
Hey, no no no, relax. Relax. It's okay,
these guys are gonna take good care of you.

04:40.897 --> 04:43.378
Ma'am, you were alone
in the car, is that right?

04:45.460 --> 04:47.266
Mommy!

04:51.371 --> 04:52.413
Thanks.

04:56.806 --> 04:58.583
We better get to work, eh?

05:09.391 --> 05:11.368
How's your head?
- It's fine, thank you.

05:11.369 --> 05:13.254
Alright, well, just in case, I'm driving today.

05:13.255 --> 05:16.351
Alright, let's see what Mr. silver dollar has
to say. What do you want, heads or tails?

05:16.352 --> 05:17.352
Tails.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.887
Tails. Drive or drive?

05:20.888 --> 05:23.075
Drive. And I'm driving till you get
your headache checked out.

05:23.076 --> 05:25.369
Mr. Logan, Mr. Bey.

05:28.943 --> 05:30.064
Listen up.

05:31.051 --> 05:34.672
Do not come to me, okay, requesting
overtime. It ain't gonna happen.

05:34.673 --> 05:36.522
I wouldn't do that. *******

05:36.472 --> 05:38.586
Yeah, I know your wouldn't. But he would.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.994
That little stop that you made before work?

05:44.187 --> 05:45.567
That was off the clock.

05:45.568 --> 05:47.459
****** overtime request form.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.351
Tuck in that shirt, Mr. Bey.

05:50.727 --> 05:53.035
God, I get grumpy when I can't watch wrestling.

05:53.045 --> 05:54.435
Mr. Ryder.
- Yeah?

05:54.436 --> 05:57.734
I TiVo'ed that Iron Man/Doctor Z match last night.
(TiVo=digital recorder)

05:57.735 --> 05:58.735
Are you serious?

05:58.736 --> 05:59.736
Yeah!

05:59.737 --> 06:01.142
You know, don't tell me who won.

06:01.142 --> 06:03.650
I'll burn it for you, bring it in
tomorrow. How does that sound?

06:03.653 --> 06:04.653
Thanks, man.

06:08.393 --> 06:10.971
Are you six years old? You forgot your fly.

06:35.994 --> 06:38.564
ID says her name is Anna Sokur.

06:39.206 --> 06:40.632
Good morning, Mr. Logan.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.033
Good morning, Dr. Fawcett.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.725
I hear you've had an interesting morning.
You wanna tell me your secret?

06:46.449 --> 06:48.183
You pull a woman from a burning wreck

06:48.184 --> 06:51.004
That's not worth sharing?
- Well, you know, just another day at work.

06:51.005 --> 06:53.707
Humble and handsome. Killer combination.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.157
Olivia, okay, wait. Alright.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.723
Hey, what does that mean?

06:57.100 --> 06:59.303
That I'm having second thoughts? No.
- You?

06:59.304 --> 07:01.704
Me? No.

07:02.452 --> 07:03.350
Good.

07:03.351 --> 07:04.351
Yeah.

07:04.838 --> 07:07.567
'Cause we obviously make better friends 
than we do lovers anyway, right?

07:08.868 --> 07:09.768
Absolutely.

07:10.367 --> 07:13.642
So no reflections on anything?
- No, I agree.

07:14.604 --> 07:17.993
Listen, I have to go.
- So, are we on for drinks Friday?

07:18.462 --> 07:21.217
Uhm, I'll check my calendar.
- Right, okay.

07:22.549 --> 07:25.751
You know, I was gonna call you and tell you tonight, about...

07:26.410 --> 07:29.802
**** I've been so distracted lately.

07:29.803 --> 07:31.228
Right. Lately.

07:31.856 --> 07:34.069
Well, come on. You used to think 
that was kinda charming.

07:37.484 --> 07:39.298
You really think this is gonna work?

07:39.299 --> 07:40.299
Yeah.

07:41.135 --> 07:42.560
If you want it to.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.478
If you want it to, I want it to.

07:48.491 --> 07:52.133
Why don't you just take Oz out? 
He seems like your biggest fan anyway.

08:00.350 --> 08:02.839
Ma'am, you were alone in 
the car. Is that right? Is that right?

08:08.026 --> 08:10.253
Not so easy being a hero, huh?

08:12.166 --> 08:13.736
I need to talk to you.

08:13.737 --> 08:16.507
So, detective Marks, you're here 
to investigate the accident?

08:16.508 --> 08:19.239
Yeah, I came to get a statement from the victim, Anna Sokur.

08:19.274 --> 08:23.128
But the docs have her on pain medicine. 
So I think she's gonna be out for a while.

08:23.129 --> 08:24.977
She say anything to you 
about what happened?

08:24.978 --> 08:28.589
No, no, she was really out 
of it when we got there.

08:28.590 --> 08:32.724
That's it?
- Yeah, yeah. She's lucky to be alive.

08:33.306 --> 08:35.668
Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

08:36.820 --> 08:42.756
Uhm, actually, you know... It was a bit weird.
- What was weird?

08:43.846 --> 08:47.550
When we got there she was jammed up on 
the passenger’s side, like she wasn't driving.

08:47.957 --> 08:49.890
So, you're saying you don't think 
she was alone in the car.

08:50.526 --> 08:52.686
Maybe she was tossed when 
the car was flipped. I don't know.

08:53.719 --> 08:56.130
Guess that's what happens when 
you don't wear a seatbelt, huh?

08:56.231 --> 08:57.431
It's true.

08:57.921 --> 08:59.830
If you think of anything else, please give me a call.

08:59.831 --> 09:00.831
Yeah.
- Thanks.

09:00.832 --> 09:01.832
My pleasure.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.775
We're only beginning to scratch the 
surface in our understanding of the mind.

09:06.776 --> 09:09.574
Do you really think thoughts could 
be turned into zeros and ones?

09:09.575 --> 09:16.220
Well, we know that neurons fire. That synapses communicate. 
That memories have their own chemical signature.

09:16.228 --> 09:19.729
But you're implying that thought could 
be recorded? Replicated and transmitted?

09:19.730 --> 09:21.831
Maybe one day we'll understand 
the physics of thought

09:21.832 --> 09:23.731
the same way we do the 
motions of the planets.

09:23.732 --> 09:26.896
Stop me if I'm getting too out 
of it. Sometimes I can't tell.

09:28.957 --> 09:29.858
Excuse me a minute.

09:30.934 --> 09:34.449
I see the Ray show is up and running again.
- Standing and rolling. How have you been, Toby?

09:36.242 --> 09:37.586
I need to talk, Ray.

09:38.258 --> 09:40.240
Alright, come on.

09:42.379 --> 09:46.560
But I still don't understand what makes this so different?
- Well, I was shut down, Ray. I wasn't looking for contact.

09:46.561 --> 09:49.605
The thoughts and images, everything just hit me hard, Ray.

09:49.606 --> 09:50.606
I couldn't stop it.

09:50.607 --> 09:53.906
So, this woman? She was a block away?
- She might've been more when we first connected.

09:53.907 --> 09:56.088
So your range is increasing.
- That's not what this is about.

09:56.089 --> 09:57.645
No, I get it. It scares you.

09:57.646 --> 09:59.575
Yeah, the thoughts took over, 
I couldn't control it.

09:59.576 --> 10:02.611
Well, from the sound of it, 
you really helped this woman out.

10:03.607 --> 10:05.024
You probably saved her life.

10:05.025 --> 10:06.985
That's not the point.
- Maybe it is the point, Toby.

10:08.147 --> 10:10.063
Her cry for help was so intense...

10:10.071 --> 10:13.819
it broke down the natural barriers 
between your mind and hers.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.895
You saying I'm a human fire alarm?

10:16.521 --> 10:19.524
Feature of the intensity of 
the sender and the receiver.

10:19.525 --> 10:21.450
Do you remember how I was when 
they first brought me to you?

10:21.451 --> 10:22.343
You were a child.

10:24.930 --> 10:28.099
There was no way you could cope with
that kind of assault on the senses.

10:28.775 --> 10:30.892
I always thought you'd reach 
a certain threshold.

10:31.887 --> 10:33.879
I don't want to do one 
of your experiments.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.532
This may be a very good thing, Toby.

10:35.533 --> 10:38.410
No, it isn't. It didn't
knock you on your ass.

10:40.205 --> 10:41.321
There's something else.

10:41.322 --> 10:42.322
No.

10:45.926 --> 10:50.456
I have to do something. I might be the only 
one who can help this woman find her child.

10:50.457 --> 10:51.457
Be careful, Toby.

10:51.458 --> 10:53.210
No one can know about you.

11:04.092 --> 11:04.844
Thanks.

11:04.845 --> 11:06.045
Hey.
- Hey.

11:06.046 --> 11:07.146
How's she doing?

11:07.147 --> 11:11.566
She's better. She's a little groggy, but it looks 
like she should be out of her in a couple of days.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.675
The police are here to take a statement, 
but she won't talk to them.

11:13.676 --> 11:15.267
You don't mind if I try?

11:16.892 --> 11:18.121
I just wanna see if I can help her out.

11:18.122 --> 11:20.726
Right, and since when do 
you do bedside service?

11:20.727 --> 11:23.629
Well, you see? Maybe I've 
changed more than you thought.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.337
Hey, how are you doing?

11:34.869 --> 11:38.437
I'm Toby Logan. I was the guy 
that got you out of the car, there.

11:38.438 --> 11:42.401
That was pretty close, huh? 
How are you feeling?

11:43.598 --> 11:44.766
Should I tell him?

11:49.761 --> 11:53.454
Did you remember what happened 
to you before the accident?

12:00.833 --> 12:02.510
My God, he shot him!

12:05.363 --> 12:06.577
Give me the keys!

12:08.652 --> 12:10.182
A man cut me off.

12:11.494 --> 12:12.601
I didn't see his face.

12:13.878 --> 12:17.290
You don't remember anything else?

12:19.104 --> 12:21.192
If you tell anyone, I'll kill the kid.

12:23.386 --> 12:24.362
Mommy!

12:26.053 --> 12:27.892
Someone took your son 
from you, didn't they?

12:31.120 --> 12:33.642
You gotta tell the police what happened.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.094
Get out. Get out.

12:37.249 --> 12:38.142
Get out!

13:32.794 --> 13:33.414
I know what you're thinking.

13:33.805 --> 13:35.496
The car wreck. I hesitated.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.462
No you don't Oz, it's...

13:39.562 --> 13:43.457
Now, look. To the untrained eye it 
might've seemed like I was scared.

13:45.305 --> 13:46.384
You never hesitated.

13:46.385 --> 13:49.000
What?
- Yeah, I saw you, man.

13:49.001 --> 13:52.601
You were assessing the situation. 
You were sizing up a plan.

13:52.602 --> 13:53.602
Exactly.

13:53.603 --> 13:57.685
Yeah, absolutely. Now, had you not done that, 
maybe we wouldn't have got her out,

13:57.686 --> 13:59.136
Maybe I would've been blown up too.

13:59.137 --> 14:01.395
I guess you could say that I saved all our lives.

14:01.396 --> 14:02.684
I guess you could kinda say that.

14:02.685 --> 14:06.605
Yeah, well, Toby, I just want you to 
know that, uhm, I'm watching your back.

14:06.606 --> 14:07.842
I know you got my back, man.

14:08.663 --> 14:10.886
Hey, Toby. Watch your back.
- Alright.

14:10.887 --> 14:11.887
Toby.

14:13.448 --> 14:14.821
What exactly did you say to her?

14:14.822 --> 14:17.752
Who?
- Anna Sokur, that accident victim you brought in yesterday?

14:17.753 --> 14:20.125
Nothing, I just... Why, what's this about?

14:20.073 --> 14:22.965
She's gone. And she disappeared 
sometime after you spoke to her.

14:22.966 --> 14:26.964
Are you kid... Liv, I didn't say anything to her...
- She's in bad shape. She's got a concussion...

14:26.965 --> 14:29.617
I tried to put in a phone call to 
the cops to check up on her, but...

14:29.422 --> 14:30.694
they pretty much blew me off.

14:30.695 --> 14:35.089
Alright, so you want me to out there and find her?
- Yeah, she obviously doesn't realize how bad her condition is.

14:35.090 --> 14:38.446
Here's her address. Find her. Before she walks in front of a truck, okay?

14:42.403 --> 14:43.890
This it?
- Yeah.

14:49.660 --> 14:52.189
Alright, so, I'll be five minutes, is that cool?
- If she's there.

14:52.190 --> 14:53.490
You got a better place to look?

14:53.861 --> 14:55.560
I'm taking a cup of coffee.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.077
Can I get a double double?
- Shot of vanilla?

14:57.398 --> 14:59.936
How do you do that? It's like, 
I don't know, you read my mind...

14:59.937 --> 15:00.937
Yeah, it's a gift.

15:01.715 --> 15:02.730
It's amazing, really.

15:24.743 --> 15:29.120
You don't know who you're dealing with. 
I have your son. Someone will call.

15:34.253 --> 15:35.608
Anna, hello?

15:38.301 --> 15:39.638
Hello? Anna!

15:42.120 --> 15:44.854
Oh, hey. How are you doing? Do you know 
the girl in this apartment? Anna Sokur?

15:44.855 --> 15:47.939
Off course.
- Okay, she been by today?

15:47.940 --> 15:48.940
No.

15:51.275 --> 15:53.275
Don't tell anybody you've seen me, okay?

15:54.249 --> 15:56.394
You know, she probably told 
you not to tell anyone.

15:56.806 --> 15:58.498
Does Anna Sokur live here?

16:00.229 --> 16:01.454
I haven't seen her.

16:24.112 --> 16:24.867
Anna?

16:28.472 --> 16:30.419
Toby Logan from the hospital.

16:56.126 --> 16:58.574
"Early Rainbow Room Day Care".

17:04.551 --> 17:05.536
Logan?

17:06.575 --> 17:07.440
What are you doing here?

17:07.441 --> 17:09.494
Dr. Fawcett told me that Anna 
took off from the hospital.

17:09.420 --> 17:12.255
And she wanted me to see if she was here.
- So how did you get in?

17:12.088 --> 17:13.189
The door was open.

17:14.625 --> 17:15.969
Can I see your keys?
- What?

17:15.970 --> 17:17.587
Your keys, can I have a look at them?

17:17.588 --> 17:18.588
Yeah.

17:21.125 --> 17:24.665
Here.
- Well, look at this.

17:24.666 --> 17:26.411
Those are the keys to my bike lock.

17:26.412 --> 17:30.549
Actually, it's a bump key. The only thing to get you through a tumble lock faster is a ****.

17:31.381 --> 17:34.439
So this how you do it? You drive them to the 
hospital and you come back with a shopping list?

17:35.316 --> 17:37.178
No, that's not how I do it.

17:38.419 --> 17:41.827
Let's say we get a call from a 
widow who's gone into cardiac arrest...

17:41.828 --> 17:45.597
we show up and the door is locked and
we have to wait for you guys to show up...

17:45.632 --> 17:46.629
to bust the door down.

17:47.279 --> 17:49.209
And while we're waiting, the patient dies.

17:49.210 --> 17:50.210
Excuse me.

17:52.387 --> 17:54.133
Oh, uh, a simple question for you.

17:54.622 --> 17:56.665
Who's taking care of Anna's son?

17:56.866 --> 17:57.766
What son?

17:57.767 --> 18:00.880
Well, while I was in there stealing 
craft dinner and paper plates,

18:00.977 --> 18:03.722
I noticed a picture of her and a boy.

18:03.723 --> 18:05.301
And you assumed it was her son?

18:05.302 --> 18:08.003
Oh yeah, that's right. She said 
she didn't have a family.

18:08.064 --> 18:09.380
Why would she lie?

18:09.381 --> 18:12.286
Well, maybe she's afraid Social 
Services would come and take him.

18:12.287 --> 18:14.472
Might explain why she left 
the hospital in such a hurry.

18:14.473 --> 18:18.692
So she's out there with a head injury. 
Who's taking care of her kid?

18:42.850 --> 18:43.366
No!

18:47.170 --> 18:47.866
Oh God!

18:48.702 --> 18:50.722
Look, Anna. That's your name, isn't it?

18:51.562 --> 18:53.819
I told you to use the phone I left you.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.920
Don't play games with me. Call.

19:03.598 --> 19:04.239
Nicky?

19:07.487 --> 19:08.665
Hey kid.

19:10.509 --> 19:11.266
Nicky!

19:20.094 --> 19:21.194
What are you doing down there?

19:22.893 --> 19:23.728
I was scared.

19:23.729 --> 19:24.729
Scared of what?

19:25.063 --> 19:27.317
The people you said 
would come and get me.

19:27.318 --> 19:29.865
Okay, listen, I told you. 
You'd be safe here, alright?

19:29.866 --> 19:31.166
Nobody can find you.

19:31.167 --> 19:32.167
Get out of there.

19:33.225 --> 19:35.985
I'm sorry, Mister.
- Come here.

19:37.813 --> 19:39.831
Listen to me, okay?

19:39.866 --> 19:41.987
I told you to sit in there and watch TV.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.808
When is my mommy coming?
- I don't know.

19:46.809 --> 19:49.489
It's gonna be over real soon, okay. 
We're gonna figure this out.

19:50.852 --> 19:52.745
We're gonna figure this out, and uhm...

19:54.364 --> 19:57.640
I'm just gonna get in touch with your mother.

19:57.641 --> 19:58.641
Yeah, let's call her.

20:06.537 --> 20:07.892
Hey, Anna.

20:10.002 --> 20:13.351
I'm getting really disappointed 
that I keep hearing this machine.

20:15.553 --> 20:19.519
Nicky and I really need to see you.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.784
He's scared.

20:22.007 --> 20:24.991
Next time I call, I hope you're there.

20:27.043 --> 20:28.928
Just stay by the phone!

20:33.643 --> 20:35.026
You wanted to talk to your mother?

20:38.483 --> 20:44.287
Hi mommy. I miss you. And I wish you could get here.

20:46.039 --> 20:47.091
I love you, mommy.

20:51.023 --> 20:52.224
God.

21:34.034 --> 21:35.200
Mommy!

21:36.248 --> 21:38.030
If you tell anyone I'll kill the kid!

21:39.284 --> 21:40.116
Get out!

21:44.557 --> 21:46.245
Your name is Toby. Say it.
- Toby.

21:46.046 --> 21:48.749
Toby Logan. Say it again.
- Toby Logan.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.051
That's the only name 
you've ever had, okay?

21:54.332 --> 21:57.368
Toby?
- Ray?

21:57.369 --> 21:59.478
I knocked. The door was open.

22:01.748 --> 22:03.801
I haven't heard from you. 
I left you a couple of messages.

22:03.602 --> 22:06.494
Oh, no, I just uhm... I'm a little...

22:06.495 --> 22:08.974
You don't have to read my mind to 
know I'm worried about you.

22:10.598 --> 22:13.059
And I'm sure there's a lot more 
going on than you want out there.

22:14.346 --> 22:20.166
Oh, Ray, it's just this change, somehow... 
It's making me remember my past.

22:20.167 --> 22:22.074
How far back?

22:22.075 --> 22:24.464
I can't piece it together, 
it's all fragmented.

22:25.319 --> 22:27.480
I'm not even sure it's things 
I wanna remember.

22:27.481 --> 22:28.703
What are you afraid of, Toby?

22:30.528 --> 22:33.639
From what little I know about 
my mother, she had the gift too.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.068
She was possessed by the voices.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.053
They drove her out of her mind.

22:37.054 --> 22:38.755
You afraid that's what's 
gonna happen to you?

22:39.968 --> 22:41.330
Yeah, wouldn't you be?

22:41.654 --> 22:42.870
We'll get through this.

23:06.471 --> 23:08.335
That looked serious. Is everything okay?

23:08.336 --> 23:12.738
Yeah, it's alright. It's Jake King, 
he's in undercover with the 35.

23:13.493 --> 23:16.896
He hasn't checked into his CO for a couple of days or 
anyone on his team. I'm just keeping an eye on him. That's all.

23:17.416 --> 23:18.464
How's your case coming?

23:18.465 --> 23:19.865
A lot of dead ends.

23:19.866 --> 23:20.866
What you got?

23:20.867 --> 23:25.459
Anna Sokur, 28, single mom. 
Works at a local diner.

23:25.460 --> 23:26.851
They haven't seen her in two days.

23:26.852 --> 23:27.852
Father?

23:27.853 --> 23:28.853
Not in the picture.

23:28.854 --> 23:29.854
Check out her place?

23:30.299 --> 23:33.241
Yes. Super says she pays her rent 
on time and keeps out of trouble.

23:33.242 --> 23:33.850
How about the kid?

23:33.332 --> 23:35.522
What about him?
- How old is he?

23:35.257 --> 23:36.583
From the picture I got, maybe 5.

23:37.401 --> 23:38.935
I went to his day care, 
they haven't seen her.

23:38.968 --> 23:40.277
I have a parent list.

23:40.278 --> 23:43.737
Parents mingle, so if she's in trouble or she's 
scared, maybe she confided in someone.

23:44.477 --> 23:45.801
Alright, let me know what you find.

23:49.202 --> 23:52.205
It's odd. I saw her car pull up, 
but they never came in.

23:52.206 --> 23:54.822
Sorry I can't be more help.
- I'm sure *****.

23:55.823 --> 23:57.123
Okay, good luck with that.
- Thank you.

24:10.513 --> 24:12.216
Oh my God! He's shot him!

25:00.581 --> 25:02.891
So you're so worried about this boy

25:02.892 --> 25:05.136
that you came all the way to a day 
care to see if anyone knew anything?

25:05.137 --> 25:07.785
Yeah, yeah, and you were right. 
No one knew anything.

25:07.932 --> 25:09.342
How'd you know about the car?

25:09.343 --> 25:12.980
Well, these little kids as I was walking came up to 
me and said that I should check out this car.

25:12.441 --> 25:14.245
It's been here for a few days.

25:15.492 --> 25:19.142
And these kids just conveniently disappear 
and you, out of idle curiosity, pop the trunk?

25:19.143 --> 25:20.143
Yeah, idle curiosity.

25:20.461 --> 25:23.170
Yeah, and then you decide to pick 
up the phone and call me. Why me?

25:22.171 --> 25:25.295
Because you're the only detective I know.

25:26.122 --> 25:29.754
What is with this big turnout? 
Is this guy important or something?

25:29.755 --> 25:31.377
He was a cop.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.247
No kidding?

25:34.841 --> 25:38.104
The entire force is gonna be over this. Especially his partner.

26:02.296 --> 26:03.873
You're the guy that found the body?

26:04.074 --> 26:05.074
Yeah, that's right.

26:06.409 --> 26:08.173
Every cop in the city was 
out looking for my partner

26:08.219 --> 26:10.985
and some off duty paramedic 
finds him. How does that happen?

26:10.986 --> 26:12.277
Mike, relax.

26:12.278 --> 26:15.424
**** somebody killed my partner. You better 
believe I'm gonna be all over this.

26:19.390 --> 26:21.303
You have no idea who did this?

26:21.652 --> 26:23.429
No. Who is this guy?

26:23.430 --> 26:26.908
You understand, I have a partner. 
I know where he is all the time.

26:26.909 --> 26:28.777
I mean, you gotta have some 
idea why this happened.

26:28.778 --> 26:30.282
What are you trying to say?
- Mike!

26:30.283 --> 26:31.283
What are you trying to say to me?

26:31.805 --> 26:34.813
****. I'm turning myself in!
- Put the gun down!

26:35.014 --> 26:36.014
No!

26:35.915 --> 26:37.015
What are you trying to say, huh?

26:42.123 --> 26:43.260
We'll handle this.

26:45.221 --> 26:47.251
What the hell was that about?
- I don't know.

26:47.252 --> 26:48.852
I don't know, I'm sorry.

26:48.853 --> 26:51.685
Well, you're still gonna have to come to 
the station and give an official statement.

26:51.686 --> 26:52.686
Let's go.

26:54.148 --> 26:54.577
Let's go!

26:57.505 --> 27:00.530
Earlier today, the body of a 
Police officer of the 35 division...

27:00.560 --> 27:04.679
was found in the trunk of a car parked outside the 
Early Rainbow Room Day Care in downtown Toronto.

27:16.007 --> 27:17.007
You Anna?

27:20.935 --> 27:22.719
Gerry from the pawn shop told me to give you this.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.720
Yeah, yeah. Okay fine.

27:23.721 --> 27:25.555
We don't need any formal introductions.

27:26.246 --> 27:27.228
Do you have 200 bucks?

27:28.229 --> 27:29.229
Yeah.

27:35.385 --> 27:38.910
Okay. Look , you've got choices.
- I just want a gun.

27:38.911 --> 27:44.378
Okay. Automatic, semi-auto, revolver?
- I don't care.

27:47.175 --> 27:48.503
Yeah, okay.

27:51.519 --> 27:55.057
This is a .38 caliber. It's lightweight, 
dependable on short range.

27:55.887 --> 27:56.920
You gonna get in close?

28:00.097 --> 28:01.921
I don't know.

28:01.922 --> 28:05.854
Okay, look. The serial number 
is gone. It's untraceable.

28:09.843 --> 28:11.844
You do know how to hold 
one of these, right?

28:11.845 --> 28:12.845
No.

28:16.071 --> 28:18.414
It's like you're shaking his hand.

28:28.420 --> 28:29.861
Thank you.

28:32.800 --> 28:36.615
Here you go. First time bonus on me.

28:51.253 --> 28:53.548
So how much do you know about 
this dead guy's partner?

28:53.549 --> 28:54.649
Henderson?

28:55.866 --> 28:57.004
He's a guys guy.

28:57.521 --> 28:59.248
Probably came at you because 
you stepped over the line.

29:00.034 --> 29:02.682
What if he had something to do with it?
- With what?

29:02.683 --> 29:03.523
His partner is dead.

29:04.655 --> 29:05.770
You think he killed his partner?

29:05.771 --> 29:07.406
A woman and a kid go missing for two days.

29:07.709 --> 29:10.899
A cop goes missing, the cop is found 
in the trunk near the kid's day care.

29:12.486 --> 29:14.766
The day care worker says the woman 
was there the morning of the accident.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.227
What if she witnessed the murder?

29:16.220 --> 29:17.298
Wrong place at the wrong time?

29:17.299 --> 29:18.935
If you need anything, call.

29:18.936 --> 29:19.936
Alright.

29:19.937 --> 29:20.937
Sorry, Mike.

29:23.165 --> 29:24.300
Who is this guy?

29:27.575 --> 29:29.431
But we still don't know where 
the woman or her kid are.

29:29.432 --> 29:30.980
Unless off course you can enlighten me.

29:33.161 --> 29:34.575
I don't know where she is.

29:34.616 --> 29:37.984
She said she was scared of something
and that she couldn't go to the cops.

29:38.279 --> 29:40.134
And you just remembered this now? 
Why didn't you say anything?

29:40.228 --> 29:42.065
Well, you told me to stay out of our business.

29:42.066 --> 29:43.066
Marks.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.855
I'll be right back.

31:26.121 --> 31:28.069
Nicky, Nicky!

31:28.814 --> 31:30.202
Mommy!

31:34.465 --> 31:36.244
You gotta open the door, okay?

31:37.141 --> 31:38.623
Just turn the lock.

31:44.220 --> 31:46.487
I was expecting a call, 
but I'm glad you dropped by.

32:54.887 --> 32:56.400
You got a reason for going 
through that stuff?

32:56.401 --> 32:58.301
Hey, how are you doing?

32:58.638 --> 33:00.315
I'm doing fine.
- Good.

33:00.608 --> 33:01.688
How'd you get in here?

33:01.689 --> 33:04.974
Mike left the door open for me, said he
was gonna be by in a few minutes.

33:04.975 --> 33:06.715
He left for his cabin a half hour ago.

33:08.139 --> 33:09.649
He hasn't left for the 
cabin already, has he?

33:11.420 --> 33:14.299
Mike and I are pretty close, 
being neighbors and all.

33:15.070 --> 33:17.029
I don't think I've seen you around before.

33:22.085 --> 33:23.123
So where's this place?

33:24.891 --> 33:25.756
Mike's cabin.

33:26.168 --> 33:28.428
Old Heart Lake ****.

33:28.429 --> 33:29.950
Oh, Heart Lake.

33:32.581 --> 33:34.428
You know, maybe I'll just drive up there myself.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.909
Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
- Thank you.

33:44.106 --> 33:45.973
This is Charlie Marks, leave a message.

33:46.064 --> 33:48.162
Detective Marks, listen, it's Toby Logan.

33:48.173 --> 33:49.831
Henderson has Anna Sokur.

33:49.899 --> 33:53.330
His neighbor told me he's taking 
them up to his lodge on Heart Lake.

33:53.189 --> 33:55.102
North on highway 47.

34:05.888 --> 34:07.844
I've played poker up there. 
It's about an hour north of here.

34:07.845 --> 34:09.110
Let's just hope we have an hour.

34:09.110 --> 34:11.273
Logan, this is Detective Marks. Give me a call back now.

34:38.402 --> 34:42.802
Look, I won't say anything. 
Please. Please just let us go.

34:42.803 --> 34:45.304
It's alright mommy. He's a 
Policeman. He'll protect us.

34:47.161 --> 34:48.043
That's right, Nicky.

34:50.603 --> 34:51.972
That's all I want.

34:51.973 --> 34:54.322
It's to protect you and your mom.

34:56.121 --> 34:58.459
And everybody from all the bad people.

35:01.648 --> 35:03.430
I want you to sit here, Nicky.

35:03.886 --> 35:05.504
I wanna sit with my mommy.

35:05.505 --> 35:06.940
I want you to sit here.

35:08.262 --> 35:11.560
I'll have to do something now. 
I'll have to take them into the woods.

35:14.442 --> 35:18.095
Please. Just let us go, 
I won't say anything.

35:19.696 --> 35:20.596
I can't do that.

35:20.697 --> 35:21.688
I didn't see anything.

35:21.777 --> 35:23.302
Don't lie to me!

35:23.503 --> 35:24.511
You saw us that morning!

35:24.929 --> 35:26.803
We're gonna go for a walk.

35:26.804 --> 35:27.404
No!

35:27.405 --> 35:28.805
This has to end now.

35:29.867 --> 35:32.532
Just do whatever you want 
to me, just let my baby go.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.027
We're going for a walk.

35:47.196 --> 35:48.246
Come on. Run, Nicky!

36:05.067 --> 36:06.367
Oh no!

36:07.531 --> 36:09.287
It's okay. It's okay.

36:14.007 --> 36:15.372
There's nowhere to run now.

36:16.105 --> 36:17.522
Henderson! Henderson!

36:18.937 --> 36:19.723
You don't have to do this.

36:19.724 --> 36:21.324
How the hell did you know?

36:21.673 --> 36:23.589
They have nothing to do 
with this. They're innocent.

36:24.388 --> 36:26.792
Your partner's death, 
I know it was an accident.

36:27.320 --> 36:28.310
I know you didn't mean to.

36:28.311 --> 36:29.311
You don't know anything.

36:29.312 --> 36:30.712
I know you are a good cop.

36:31.113 --> 36:32.213
You can stop it right now.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.010
Henderson, let them go, man.

36:37.019 --> 36:38.930
I have to finish this.

36:40.946 --> 36:42.004
No!

36:44.506 --> 36:47.186
Grab my hand! Come here, grab my hand!

36:47.187 --> 36:47.887
Grab his hand.

36:47.887 --> 36:48.891
Come here. Grab my hand.

36:48.916 --> 36:51.018
Nicky, look at me. You can trust me.

36:51.019 --> 36:52.019
Take my hand.

36:55.037 --> 36:57.527
Good boy. Come on.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.882
So, what is it with you?
- What do you mean?

37:41.883 --> 37:44.696
How'd you know Henderson was bad?
And don't say it was a hunch.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.886
Okay. I have a gift.

37:47.625 --> 37:48.634
You have a gift?

37:50.028 --> 37:51.984
Don't we all? Nice to meet you, Toby.

37:52.073 --> 37:53.473
You too, Detective.

37:57.127 --> 37:59.099
So, I hear you've had a 
rough couple of days.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.300
Yeah, it's been interesting.

38:00.301 --> 38:02.581
You're not gonna tell me 
about it, are you?

38:02.582 --> 38:04.930
Do you wanna grab a drink?
I could tell you all about it.

38:06.046 --> 38:08.138
I'm off in an hour.

38:09.212 --> 38:10.399
Sounds good.

38:11.092 --> 38:12.004
Great.

38:17.201 --> 38:22.074
All my life, I told myself: "Turn it off, 
shut it down, make it go away".

38:24.210 --> 38:28.606
Today I broke the rule. I stopped looking 
the other way and I saw the truth.

38:31.573 --> 38:34.532
This isn't a curse, it's a gift.
