00:38.038 --> 00:39.430
Oh, shit.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.606
Wait.
Who you beeping at, dawg?

00:41.780 --> 00:43.260
Who you beeping at, son?

00:43.434 --> 00:44.566
Oh, man.

00:44.783 --> 00:45.958
Wait, can you live
with no kidneys?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.308
I think you can.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.179
Nah, man, I don't think
that's true.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.225
I think you need
at least one.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.488
- Shit.
- That's what dialysis is for, though, right?

00:53.749 --> 00:55.055
Yeah, man,
but she doesn't want to live

00:55.229 --> 00:56.447
depending on that shit.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.058
- You know, like...
- Yeah.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.538
She keeps pissing
herself, she can't barely walk,

01:01.191 --> 01:04.150
not long ago, she couldn't even
recognize Carmen.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.022
Her own fucking daughter.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.763
Whoa, wait,
this is Carmen's mom?

01:07.937 --> 01:09.721
Yeah, what the fuck
were you talking about?

01:09.895 --> 01:11.114
Nah, I thought
it was her grandma.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.507
Exactly!

01:12.768 --> 01:14.291
She's not that old, man.

01:14.509 --> 01:15.988
- Shit.
- But...

01:16.163 --> 01:17.686
old enough to make
her own decisions, you know?

01:17.860 --> 01:19.775
Shit, is Carmen losing it?
That's fucked up.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.385
She's broken, for sure,

01:21.690 --> 01:24.084
but I'm like "Baby, your mom has
the right to decide...

01:24.997 --> 01:26.216
to do what she wants,"
you know?

01:26.390 --> 01:28.305
To be treated or not.
I mean...

01:29.219 --> 01:30.829
Nobody wants to spend
their last days locked

01:31.003 --> 01:32.396
in some hospital or...

01:32.788 --> 01:34.529
You know, if she doesn't want
to go through dialysis

01:34.703 --> 01:36.008
then she shouldn't
have to do it.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.402
Yeah, I know, but what if
she lives like 10 more years?

01:38.707 --> 01:40.839
You know? And then her kids
gotta take care of her,

01:41.318 --> 01:42.624
like that,
for like 10 more years,

01:42.798 --> 01:44.191
and they're super stressed out,

01:44.365 --> 01:45.627
and Carmen gets more
and more stressed out,

01:46.018 --> 01:47.237
and that makes you
stressed out.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.326
You know what I mean?

01:49.848 --> 01:51.198
Yeah, I can't take no more
of this shit either, man.

01:51.372 --> 01:52.503
- This entire fucking...
- Man, this is so...

01:52.677 --> 01:53.809
- ...family's stressed out.
- Yeah.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.376
Everybody's psycho.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.987
All she thinks about is her mom,
like, kicking the bucket.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.684
- Yeah.
- You know, we haven't had sex

01:59.858 --> 02:02.078
in like two months,
my nuts are about to explode.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.558
Fucking crazy.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.603
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.
- Uh-oh.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.344
- Yo, we low key.
- We got roll, baby.

02:07.518 --> 02:08.562
We got roll.

02:09.258 --> 02:10.520
Right, you're gonna have
to steer hard.

02:10.695 --> 02:12.044
Right.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.264
Well, hopefully the family
can convince her now, right?

02:14.786 --> 02:16.005
Shit,
good luck with that.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.050
She's just as stubborn
as Carmen.

02:20.575 --> 02:21.837
Yo, she's coming
towards us.

02:22.359 --> 02:23.621
Hey!

02:23.969 --> 02:25.362
Uh-oh, here she comes.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.498
- Hi!
- Hi, how are you?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.282
What happened?
Did you run out of gas?

02:32.456 --> 02:34.937
Yes, ma'am, my trusted co-pilot
here thought

02:35.111 --> 02:36.547
we'd make it by now,
but he got a little

02:36.721 --> 02:38.332
- turned around in the process.
- It's my fault.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.334
My husband has the car
or I'd help you, I'm so sorry.

02:40.508 --> 02:41.944
Oh, it's fine.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.076
It's okay, our friends
are coming, they live nearby.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.687
- They're gonna be here any minute.
- Where are you...

02:45.861 --> 02:48.255
- Where are you going?
- Uh, 300 Peekamoose.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.082
Oh, that's just down
the road.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.736
- Yeah, I know.
- It's the two blue houses,

02:51.910 --> 02:53.912
- side by side. Yeah.
- Exactly.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.740
You're visiting
the Argentinean fellow?

02:55.914 --> 02:57.394
- Nico.
- Nico, that's it.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.569
- Very nice!
- Sweetheart.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.005
Yeah, wonderful guy.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.877
I hadn't had the chance
to meet him yet.

03:02.138 --> 03:02.878
- Ah, good.
- So yeah, we'll see how that goes.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.227
Yeah sure, sure.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.663
So where are you coming from?

03:05.924 --> 03:07.883
- Oh, just in the city.
- New York City?

03:08.057 --> 03:10.102
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, good, good.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.539
- Yeah.
- Not too far.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.454
- Yeah.
- Just up for a weekend.

03:13.628 --> 03:14.846
- Right, right, right.
- Good, I'm Silvia.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.457
- Oh, Tyler!
- Ah, pleasure!

03:16.631 --> 03:18.067
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, pleasure.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.591
Well,
if your friends bail on you,

03:20.765 --> 03:21.940
I live right
around the corner.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.812
- Tons of room.
- All right, thank you!

03:23.986 --> 03:25.988
- Well, good luck to you.
- All right, thank you so much.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.772
Good to meet you.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.165
- Nice to meet you too.
- All right.

03:29.339 --> 03:30.384
- Yeah, and your name?
- John.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.820
John, John.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.300
- Have a great time, guys.
- Thank you so much.

03:33.517 --> 03:34.126
- Enjoy.
- All right, we will.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.215
Okay.

03:35.606 --> 03:36.607
Stupid!

03:36.781 --> 03:38.000
I hope
your friends show up!

03:38.174 --> 03:39.131
- Yeah.
- All right!

03:39.306 --> 03:40.655
They should be here any second.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.047
Where are they?

03:42.526 --> 03:44.049
I don't know where they are.
They should be here.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.922
Photographs have just been
released by the National Park Service.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.272
You remember the dispute
about the inaugural crowds.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.100
President Trump claimed...

03:51.361 --> 03:52.710
that it was one
of the biggest...

03:52.884 --> 03:54.059
Oh-ho-ho!

03:54.321 --> 03:55.147
Yo, Pete,

03:55.322 --> 03:56.410
sit the fuck down, man!

04:04.505 --> 04:05.810
Pretty babies.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.422
All the pretty babies.

04:08.944 --> 04:09.945
Oh, my God.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.121
Oh, here he comes.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.993
Here we come.
Here we come.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.560
They go around one,

04:16.952 --> 04:17.995
- and then they go around two.
- What's goin' on?

04:18.170 --> 04:20.216
What's happening?

04:21.173 --> 04:22.523
Everybody, clear a way!

04:22.697 --> 04:24.133
Ah! It's your birthday.
Man, get off me.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.395
- How you doing?
- Nico.

04:25.569 --> 04:26.962
- Tyler.
- Nice to meet you.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.572
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.444
- Happy birthday.
- How you doing, man?

04:30.835 --> 04:31.793
I'm good.
I'm Roddy.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.273
All right, Tyler.

04:33.621 --> 04:34.578
- Good to meet you.
- Good to see you.

04:35.623 --> 04:36.624
- Max, this is Tyler.
- Good, Tyrel, nice to meet you, man.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.321
Oh, it's actually Tyler,
but...

04:38.626 --> 04:39.757
- Oh. Sorry, man.
- No, it's good. It's good.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.281
- Max, you idiot.
- What?

04:41.455 --> 04:42.934
Roddy. Oh my God.
Good to see you, man.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.414
- Good to see you.
- Let's get on the car.

04:44.588 --> 04:45.894
Yeah, let's do it.
Tyler, can you get

04:46.068 --> 04:47.243
uh... the thingy on?

04:47.417 --> 04:48.766
Yeah, for sure,
for sure, for sure.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.681
- How the fuck you doing?
- I'm good, man.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.117
- I'm good. Damn, you look good.
- Good to see you.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.902
Good to finally meet you.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.644
We met at the restaurant, right?

04:56.861 --> 04:58.646
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah, we met before.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.517
At Chivo's?
So you met at Chivo's?

05:00.691 --> 05:02.345
What's he talking about,
good to meet me?

05:02.867 --> 05:03.738
What's that shit?

05:04.086 --> 05:05.261
He don't remember me?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.524
- I don't know, dude.
- You got it?

05:07.698 --> 05:09.831
Hey. You don't...
you don't remember me?

05:10.005 --> 05:11.136
Pete, stop.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.095
- No, no I don't.
- This face?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.836
I wasn't wearing the hat,
I apologize.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.620
- No, I'm sorry, man. I don't.
- Motherfucker.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.056
Can you shake it a little bit?
Shake the car.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.450
Yeah.
What's wrong with the car?

05:20.624 --> 05:21.756
- Is this your car?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.890
So you really don't
remember me, huh?

05:26.064 --> 05:27.414
Over at Chivo's?

05:27.588 --> 05:29.241
Dude, you kidding me with this?
Let it go.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.331
- No.
- You got it wrong.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.028
First of all,
it was Chilo's.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.987
Motherfucker, and I told you...
I told you on the phone.

05:36.161 --> 05:37.859
Peach Pit, Peach Pit
is our new place.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.513
It's a new place, new location,
you know?

05:39.687 --> 05:41.123
Yeah. Peach Pit.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.691
Nah,
it's actually Peach Pip.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.170
You see how much he loves me?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.390
Peach Pit,
Your name's Peach, huh?

05:47.564 --> 05:48.435
- Peach, motherfucker.
- Peach.

05:48.609 --> 05:49.827
Yeah, like the fruit.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.307
My grandmother's name
was Peaches

05:51.481 --> 05:52.787
- and she, um...
- Oh, yeah?

05:52.961 --> 05:55.398
Yeah, and she... she gave me
all the recipes.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.921
You know?
So it's kind of like a play

05:57.095 --> 05:58.227
on words
what we did there, yeah.

05:58.401 --> 05:59.315
- Oh. That's cool.
- Yeah,

05:59.489 --> 06:00.708
things are going pretty good.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.101
It's like our own spin
on Southern cuisine, but...

06:03.406 --> 06:05.234
People, like, really love
our famous meats.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.801
We smoke our meats
for like 15 hours.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.150
- No shit.
- Mm- hmm.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.282
- It's a recipe for Fabian, too.
- Still.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.719
Fuck me, man.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.982
No shit, dude, like
that 15- hour smoked.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.114
So when can I get a taste, huh?

06:16.288 --> 06:18.203
Hey, whenever you ready, man.
I suggest you come down

06:18.378 --> 06:19.814
and get your life changed,
you know?

06:20.162 --> 06:21.903
- - I'm sorry
man, I didn't mean nothing.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.993
I thought I met you over there
at the Chi... Chilo's. Chilo's.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.125
- No, man.
- I'm sorry, man.

06:27.517 --> 06:28.953
- Well, actually...
- You look familiar.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.434
So, how'd you get roped
into this shit?

06:32.130 --> 06:34.655
Well, we had... my girl has
some... some family driving

06:34.829 --> 06:36.265
- from Syracuse.
- Uh-huh?

06:36.439 --> 06:38.136
My house is, like,
full of people right now.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.225
I don't even have a bed to sleep
in in my own apartment, so...

06:40.704 --> 06:42.314
- I really appreciate you having me.
- No, man.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.012
A friend of Johnny's
is a friend of mine.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.324
Figure it out?
All right.

06:54.762 --> 06:55.676
Fuck.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.028
Hey, Max,
can you get the dog?

07:00.202 --> 07:01.159
Yeah, I got the dog.

07:01.333 --> 07:02.552
Thanks, man.

07:02.726 --> 07:03.771
I like the dog better
than you guys.

07:04.859 --> 07:06.817
Look at the white baby!

07:07.122 --> 07:09.559
This is my
inflatable girlfriend.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.561
- You guys seen this?
- Nico, why do you have this?

07:11.735 --> 07:14.477
I got it,
I found it in the attic, okay?

07:15.173 --> 07:16.740
- You found it, it was here?
- Yeah.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.829
- This was here? Just like that?
- Yeah.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.265
It's so fucking big.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.180
But I don't know, I think
it has a hole or something.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.966
- Let me try it out.
- Oh, my God.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.533
I'm gonna try that again.
Check it out.

07:26.750 --> 07:27.708
Yeah, I'm going to
tie him up over here.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.318
Hey, can you, uh...

07:29.492 --> 07:31.146
- can you show them the rooms?
- Yeah.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.802
Hey, take off your shoes!

07:35.019 --> 07:36.325
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Take them off.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.762
- This is Nico's room.
- Oh, wow!

07:39.154 --> 07:41.199
- He painted the floors white.
- I know,

07:41.373 --> 07:42.897
- he hates it, though.
- Looks really good.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.725
- It gets dirty too fast.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.858
It was Nina's idea, though.
She likes everything white.

07:48.424 --> 07:51.079
And I'll be sleeping
with him, so, uh...

07:51.253 --> 07:53.385
there's this blow up mattress. One
of you guys can blow that up.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.083
Aw, we're not
sharing a bed?

07:55.779 --> 07:57.346
- Baby, not this time.
- No!

07:57.520 --> 07:59.391
- I know!
- No!

07:59.783 --> 08:02.743
And then over here,
this is Max's room,

08:02.917 --> 08:04.571
- but he snores like a motherfucker.
- Right.

08:04.745 --> 08:07.312
And I don't know whose
room this is, but just take it.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.532
- Okay.
- And find out if someone,

08:09.706 --> 08:12.448
- you know...
- So... are we sharing a bed?

08:12.622 --> 08:14.581
I'm not sharing
a bed! Mm-mm.

08:14.755 --> 08:15.886
What do you mean
you're not sharing a bed?

08:16.060 --> 08:17.105
Not with any straight dudes,
anyway.

08:17.279 --> 08:18.628
What's wrong with us?

08:18.933 --> 08:20.630
The only man I'm going to sleep
with is one I can

08:20.804 --> 08:22.589
- put my arms around...
- I'd put my arms around you.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.112
...and hump
from behind.

08:24.634 --> 08:25.896
- I'd come from behind you.
- Not a straight man

08:26.070 --> 08:29.030
is exactly what I'm saying.
Back off!

08:29.204 --> 08:30.814
Maybe I'll wiggle
a little less.

08:30.988 --> 08:34.514
The thingy is Netgear45
and the password's on the --

08:34.688 --> 08:35.950
in the...
on the fridge.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.908
- On top of the fridge.
- Thank you.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.216
Yeah, dude.
So basically, her hair is gone.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.347
- She's, it's not, like completely gone...
- It's falling off

08:43.523 --> 08:45.133
- in clumps.
- It's falling off slowly.

08:45.307 --> 08:46.961
- She's losing her hair?
- But get this. Get this.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.484
- Why?
- Tell him, tell him why.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.660
So Stella is this woman
who is fucking

08:50.834 --> 08:52.532
every single married guy
that she knows.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.185
She's been breaking
every single home.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.839
And because of that,
she's losing her hair?

08:56.013 --> 08:57.493
She's got the evil eye,

08:57.667 --> 08:59.451
and the evil eye is making her
lose her hair.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.105
What is evil eye?
What is evil eye?

09:01.279 --> 09:02.890
- It's like a curse.
- Someone cursed her?

09:03.064 --> 09:04.500
So, Francesca... so she fucked
Francesca's husband...

09:04.674 --> 09:05.980
Max, are you making
hot toddies?

09:06.154 --> 09:07.416
Hottest toddies!

09:07.895 --> 09:09.113
Are you on Facebook
again, motherfucker?

09:09.287 --> 09:10.506
I had to "like" some shit.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.029
Right, but you fucked
Stella too?

09:12.334 --> 09:13.944
- Hmm?
- You fucked Stella?

09:14.466 --> 09:15.946
- Nah, she only has this thing with married men.
- Don't lie.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.295
- I just came here.
- No, that's not true,

09:17.469 --> 09:19.471
she'd fuck anybody.
She'd fuck him.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.778
I'm down.
Can I get her number, man?

09:21.952 --> 09:23.737
You're down now...
Toddy!

09:23.911 --> 09:27.175
You get a toddy, you get
a toddy, and you get a toddy.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.873
I'm like the fucking Oprah
of toddies over here, right?

09:30.091 --> 09:32.833
- Maxine, you're a doll.
- These are famous.

09:33.442 --> 09:34.835
- Oh, yeah.
- Mmm.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.358
Mm!

09:36.837 --> 09:38.229
Don't burn yourself.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.145
This is a fine fucking time
to tell me.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.321
I'm sorry.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.063
No. I'm joking, man.
I'm joking.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.413
You know, like, when people trip
and you're like, "Watch out!"

09:48.588 --> 09:49.763
like, after the fact, like?

09:49.937 --> 09:51.068
Okay.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.636
- It's true.
- I'll remember that.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.030
You good?

09:56.987 --> 09:58.075
Why Toddy, though?

09:58.249 --> 10:00.251
Who even is Toddy?
Like, why?

10:00.425 --> 10:02.471
It's like some Irish faggot.
Just look it up,

10:02.645 --> 10:04.125
- or something like that.
- Hey! Hey!

10:04.299 --> 10:05.996
- What?
- Who said faggot?

10:06.214 --> 10:07.911
Dude, I didn't mean it
in, like, a derogatory sense.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.218
So, Roddy, what's the
etymology of the word faggot?

10:10.522 --> 10:12.133
- What does it mean, exactly?
- You know what? That's not your question.

10:12.307 --> 10:13.351
"It rubs the lotion on the skin,

10:13.525 --> 10:15.484
or else it gets the hose again."

10:15.832 --> 10:18.052
Shit, man,
that's so fucking ignorant.

10:18.835 --> 10:21.316
- Chinese, Chinese...
- So easy. Yes! Chinese!

10:21.882 --> 10:23.579
You guys are assholes,
you know that?

10:23.753 --> 10:25.146
- Clearly.
- Yeah!

10:25.320 --> 10:26.843
Let me go, let me go!
I'll go, I'll go!

10:27.017 --> 10:28.497
Fuck you.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.325
- Yeah, fuck you too, motherfucker.
- Go Max, go.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.805
All right, all right,
c'mon.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.546
- Okay, all right.
- What?

10:34.721 --> 10:35.939
Um...

10:37.375 --> 10:39.247
"It puts the lotion on its skin,

10:39.421 --> 10:41.379
or else it gets the hose again."

10:41.728 --> 10:42.990
- Nope.
- A dead person.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.818
- Nope.
- I want ano...

10:44.992 --> 10:46.515
Nobody knows what that is,
that doesn't mean anything.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.169
- All right, all right.
- It wasn't Canadian?

10:48.343 --> 10:49.910
- It's dead in the water.
- It was Indian.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.389
It was Indian.

10:51.825 --> 10:52.956
For your information,
in case you wanted to know.

10:53.130 --> 10:53.914
- Who's next?
- Me?

10:54.088 --> 10:55.132
Yeah, you John.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.394
All right.

10:57.744 --> 10:58.919
Oh.

10:59.223 --> 11:00.050
What?

11:00.877 --> 11:06.143
"It rubs...
it rubs lotion on its skin

11:06.448 --> 11:08.493
- or else it gets..."
- Bjork!

11:08.668 --> 11:10.670
- Yeah!
- That Bjork was so good.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.802
All right.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.804
- Not bad.
- That was so good!

11:14.978 --> 11:16.023
Bro, I didn't know
you could act!

11:16.197 --> 11:17.502
Yeah, you're good, man.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.374
- A'ight, a'ight.
- Thanks, guys.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.594
- All right, Ty.
- No, man.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.118
- Yo, just go.
- I'm good, man.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.728
- Come on, man.
- You know, it's not me.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.512
I was terrible, man.
It'll be fine, go.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.123
Yo, I don't like games either,
I get it.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.298
- Roddy, shut the fuck up!
- Don't do it.

11:30.472 --> 11:31.952
You don't have to do it.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.389
- He doesn't have to do it.
- Oh, my goodness.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.869
Okay.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.568
- This is so stupid.
- You got it.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.004
Um...

11:41.788 --> 11:45.182
"It rubs the lotion on its skin,

11:45.966 --> 11:47.750
- or else it gets the ho-- "
- Pete: British!

11:48.142 --> 11:49.621
Boom! Boom!

11:49.796 --> 11:50.971
There you go!

11:51.232 --> 11:52.407
- It's British!
- I hear you.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.583
It was all right.
Okay.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.151
All right, Roddy,
you've gotta try it, man.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.500
You've gotta try it.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.632
Both of us hate games,
it's only right.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.464
Okay,
now this is ignorant.

12:06.682 --> 12:07.639
All right?

12:08.858 --> 12:12.079
"It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again."

12:12.862 --> 12:14.908
- American accent.
- What's that, a gay accent?

12:15.125 --> 12:17.606
Yeah. No, but that
was yourself though, right?

12:20.565 --> 12:21.871
Black accent.

12:23.525 --> 12:24.961
What does that even mean?

12:26.397 --> 12:28.182
- You know what I mean, come on.
- You wrote this?

12:28.356 --> 12:29.792
You have to be
more specific than that.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.185
Are you kidding?

12:31.446 --> 12:32.621
All right, all right,
my bad. My bad.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.536
Like a...
Like an old black lady

12:34.710 --> 12:36.451
from, like, New Orleans
or something, you know?

12:36.625 --> 12:38.670
- Mm, nuh-uh, no.
- No? What do you mean, no?

12:38.845 --> 12:40.237
- It's a thing.
- I don't know.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.152
- It's a valid accent.
- I'm done.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.240
Sorry.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.199
Hey!
Come on, come on, come on.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.984
I don't know.
Pardon the... This is stupid.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.594
- It's stupid.
- No, Roddy, come on.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.379
Just do the old black lady
from New Orleans.

12:51.553 --> 12:52.902
- He approves.
- It's cool.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.556
You know, it's not that.
It's just, I don't act.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.036
- Okay?
- Come on, Roddy.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.602
Yo, son, Ty,
you show him how to do it.

12:58.125 --> 13:01.519
- Yo! Wassup!
- Yeah, son!

13:03.783 --> 13:05.872
You teach him.
You teach him how to do it.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.265
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah, show us how it's all done.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.747
Damn, all right.
"Rubs lotion on its skin,

13:11.921 --> 13:14.054
or else it gets
the hose again. Shit."

13:14.228 --> 13:17.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, man.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.015
- What the fuck? No.
- Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.364
- No.
- No?

13:20.582 --> 13:22.062
Then you fucking do it then,
dude.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.064
Geez. I asked you first.
Don't put me on the spot.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.630
I don't think
Tyler approves.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.197
All right.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.069
No.
I'm no... No!

13:29.243 --> 13:30.679
- Just do it!
- What am I supposed to say?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.550
- Like a black accent?
- Show them how to...

13:32.724 --> 13:34.944
Do us the fucking old black lady
from New Orleans accent, man.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.293
- Just do it. Yeah.
- With the black accent?

13:36.467 --> 13:38.730
Okay.
It's dumb, come on.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.212
Tyler!

13:42.430 --> 13:43.648
Man.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.172
Don't be a pussy,
motherfucker.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.913
You've got it!

13:50.046 --> 13:52.483
"All right, you put the lotion
on your skin, look, baby.

13:52.657 --> 13:56.270
All right?
On its skin, 'scuse me.

13:56.487 --> 13:59.360
All right?
You rub it in real good.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.405
All over, you rub it in.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.538
Or else you're gonna
get the hose again."

14:03.712 --> 14:04.974
It's just, you know,
it's simple.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.542
You know?

14:08.543 --> 14:10.675
- That's good.
- That was great, man.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.025
I like you.

14:12.677 --> 14:15.637
Okay.
Okay, come on.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.857
Let's, uh... Let's play another
fucking game, uh...

14:18.118 --> 14:19.206
Yes! Please.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.947
Can I...?
Give me a beer.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.731
Yeah, yeah.
Fuck that game.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.167
Let's play a new game.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.603
You, uh...
What's that fucking, uh...?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.431
Oh, uh... Talk about nothing!

14:27.605 --> 14:28.737
- The Wikipedia game.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.478
Talking without knowing!

14:30.652 --> 14:31.827
- Talk about knowing.
- Talk without knowing!

14:32.001 --> 14:34.090
You ever played
this game? Tyler.

14:34.351 --> 14:37.006
Basically, we give you
a subject, something like that,

14:37.180 --> 14:38.703
and then you've got
to bullshit it.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.662
But you've got to sound
a professional as possible.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.316
Even if you don't know it,
you've got to pretend

14:42.490 --> 14:43.970
- that you know your shit.
- Okay!

14:44.144 --> 14:45.928
Roddy, sex change.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.800
Sex change?
Sex change, sex change.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.194
So we're dealing
with the clitoris,

14:51.455 --> 14:54.545
which is already engorged,
because of the hormones,

14:54.763 --> 14:57.679
but we've further enhanced
the new penis

14:57.897 --> 14:59.811
with a graft of skin
taken from the body,

15:00.029 --> 15:02.292
preferably from a place
with no hair.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.164
Make the bigger penis

15:04.338 --> 15:05.905
and then we take the labia

15:06.340 --> 15:08.995
and form it into a ball sack,
if you will.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.561
And voilà.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.476
- A new penis.
- You're a genius!

15:12.824 --> 15:14.304
- Bravo!
- Thank you.

15:14.478 --> 15:15.871
- All right, all right.
- Beautiful.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.612
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.831
Did you cheat? Did you
look it up on Wikipedia?

15:20.006 --> 15:21.007
I got you, I got you.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.183
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Tyler!

15:23.357 --> 15:24.358
Tyler!

15:24.749 --> 15:26.099
Black holes.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.797
- Ooh!
- Black holes.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.886
- This is good. This is good.
- DeGrasse.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.019
- Who's his name?
- I'm not... I don't even understand, man.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.716
- Neil DeGrasse Tyson, dude.
- Neil DeGrasse Tyson!

15:34.890 --> 15:36.326
Sound like that motherfucker.
You seen that shit?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.893
I'm good, man, I don't...
I'm good.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.503
That's why I named
my dog that shit.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.418
- I'm gonna sit this one out.
- Come on!

15:41.592 --> 15:43.072
- Why can't I just sit this one out?
- Tyler!

15:43.246 --> 15:44.378
- That's a fun one.
- Come on, we all fucking,

15:44.552 --> 15:45.466
we all looking like
jackasses, man.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.902
That's the whole fucking point.

15:47.555 --> 15:48.121
Come on, it's a fun subject.
This is a fun one, just do it.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.863
Um, okay.
Um...

15:53.865 --> 15:55.302
Black holes.

15:56.172 --> 15:59.610
Black holes are a...
a place in...

15:59.784 --> 16:02.004
- in space...
- Yeah?

16:02.178 --> 16:08.793
...where space meets
the next space of dark, and...

16:08.968 --> 16:11.057
It's good, keep going.
Come on, come on, come on!

16:13.537 --> 16:16.627
As a spaceship, it...
This is so s... I don't know

16:16.801 --> 16:18.194
No, you're doing good,
man!

16:18.368 --> 16:19.935
You're doing really good!
Keep going,

16:20.109 --> 16:21.763
- keep going! Come on!
- Okay, chill out, dude.

16:21.937 --> 16:22.894
What if
there was a spaceship?

16:23.069 --> 16:24.287
You got a bathroom?

16:24.461 --> 16:25.810
Do you have
a bathroom downstairs?

16:26.159 --> 16:27.116
If you want to pee,
just go outside, man.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.770
- Just pee anywhere.
- Okay.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.554
I just... I gotta use
the bathroom real quick.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.600
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, yeah. You got it man.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.167
- Thank you.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.733
I want to go,

16:35.907 --> 16:37.692
All right, circumcision.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.014

17:06.373 --> 17:07.548

17:07.722 --> 17:09.202
Max is a fucking asshole.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.594
Was that...
Was that awkward?

17:10.768 --> 17:11.813
It's all good.

17:12.378 --> 17:13.684
I ain't tripping,
I'm chilling.

17:13.944 --> 17:14.903
All right.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.866
Oh, shit.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.651
Yo, don't pee
on the porch!

17:23.867 --> 17:25.044
Don't pee on the porch.

17:25.869 --> 17:28.089
Pete, where'd you say
that spot was to get...

17:28.263 --> 17:29.613
- What's that?
- ...cell phone reception?

17:29.787 --> 17:31.441
Half a mile down that way,
man.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.313
But not even half a mile,
you know what I mean?

17:33.487 --> 17:34.923
Where you going?

17:35.097 --> 17:36.446
I'm just 'bout to go call
Carmen real quick.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.795
I'm going to this bridge
and coming right back.

17:37.969 --> 17:38.927
- Tell her I said hi.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.068
Your bitch ass ain't

20:48.159 --> 20:49.639
Yeah, though, fuck.
I don't know.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.902
I feel like one of your females

21:25.980 --> 21:26.981
Oh, shit, hi, Carmen.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.116
Fuck, man.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.596
Oh!

21:38.514 --> 21:41.169
Well,

21:41.343 --> 21:42.475
- Yeah.

21:42.649 --> 21:45.304
Oh, and cheers to Carmen.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.131
- Cheers to Carmen's mom.
- Yes.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.568
And Peach Pit.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.406
Shit.

22:01.015 --> 22:02.538
The wall you're fucking
walking against.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.584
I'm sorry, man, I'm so...

22:04.758 --> 22:06.412
Hey, okay, we're done.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.458
It's so fucking stupid.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.547
Hausmann was out!

22:11.721 --> 22:13.244
You're lulling him
to sleep.

22:14.245 --> 22:15.595
I'm like a hypnotist.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.424
- Roddy, the dog whisperer, man.
- Hello.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.295
I'm hypnotizing Cosmo.

22:20.469 --> 22:21.688
Nico.
I'm gonna change it.

22:21.862 --> 22:23.429
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.213
Guys, can you make sure
you put the fire screen

22:25.387 --> 22:26.867
on the fireplace?
Like, look, you see?

22:27.041 --> 22:28.390
You see the smoke
coming out?

22:30.566 --> 22:32.133
Hey, Tyler,

22:32.307 --> 22:33.308

- Yeah, I did.

22:33.482 --> 22:34.744
- Good.
- Thank you.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.442
No, we got some more pot
over here of what we had.

22:36.616 --> 22:37.704
Oh, my God.
What is this

22:37.878 --> 22:39.270
random collection
of records?

22:39.488 --> 22:40.837
- I don't know, man.
- So weird.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.535
Some of them were here
in the house.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.972
There's six records here
and two of them are REM.

22:45.146 --> 22:46.974
REM are Nina's,
not mine. REM, Nina's.

22:47.148 --> 22:48.541
You don't have
to be embarrassed about it.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.353
Oh, man,
no problem at all.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.530
I don't know if it's the weed
that got me tired

24:48.704 --> 24:50.314
or pushing that car
all day.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.316
I think I might knock out.
Weed got me, like, drowning.

Hey, listen, man.

You gonna sleep

25:17.864 --> 25:19.909
Uh, nah,

25:20.083 --> 25:22.259
I'm not really into the
whole bed- sharing shit so much.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.523
I might just... just
take this couch here.

25:24.697 --> 25:25.872
You never had any cousins, huh?

25:26.046 --> 25:27.830
Grew up with cousins?

25:34.271 --> 25:35.795
You wanna sit with me,
homie?

25:35.969 --> 25:37.187
You got dogs?

25:37.405 --> 25:38.972
- I don't.
- No?

25:39.146 --> 25:40.321
He makes you want one,
though.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.192
You're good with them,
man.

25:43.193 --> 25:44.543
He likes you a lot.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.283
Yeah, the feeling
is definitely mutual.

25:46.457 --> 25:47.807

Bull shit.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.537
Cosmo, Cosmo.

30:00.711 --> 30:02.801
Hey, buddy, come here.

30:11.505 --> 30:12.593
Mm.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.341
Hmm. Wanna take a walk?

30:43.450 --> 30:44.930
C'mon, man.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.110
Wanna go outside?

30:53.373 --> 30:54.461
Come on.

30:58.726 --> 30:59.945
Mm.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.391
Hey. Come on.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.393
Look what I got.
Ohh!

31:13.654 --> 31:15.438
Look what I got.

31:15.656 --> 31:16.918
Oh. Nope, nope, nope.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.577
Come on.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.405
Bring it back.
Come on.

31:38.679 --> 31:41.203
Gotcha!

31:59.178 --> 32:00.614
Jesus Christ.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.965
- Hey, man, you sleep good?
- Hey.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.662
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, good.
- Good.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.795
Sorry we got loud
last night, man.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.797
Don't even sweat it,
I knocked out.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.277
Bunch of loud
motherfuckers.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.149
It's all good.

32:14.323 --> 32:15.846
Is there anything
I can help you with?

32:16.021 --> 32:17.674
Well, I'm gonna make breakfast
for all these guys.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.459
- You want to give me a hand?
- Oh, yeah, for sure.

32:19.633 --> 32:20.895
What's that?
What are you reading?

32:21.113 --> 32:22.288
"Lord of the Flies."

32:22.636 --> 32:24.290
Oh, shit, have you
seen the... the movie?

32:24.464 --> 32:25.769
The version from the '80s?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.119
Nah, but don't...
please don't tell me

32:27.293 --> 32:28.903
because it's starting off
so good.

32:29.077 --> 32:30.731
All I can tell you, man,
is that it's a rough movie.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.125
I think I saw it
when I was too young.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.214
My dad brought me
with my brother.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.651
And it was just...
I just got traumatized, man.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.479
It scarred me, scarred me
forever. For good.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.222
Sounds like you had a pretty
rough fucking childhood.

32:43.396 --> 32:44.788
Yeah, motherfucker.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.747
It was a pretty fucking
rough childhood, man.

32:46.921 --> 32:49.184
Fuck you, man.
I tell you, man.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.317
It's not easy.

32:51.534 --> 32:53.449
What we eating?
You got any grits or something?

32:53.623 --> 32:55.886
- I actually do.
- A'ight, good, good, good.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.497
It's, uh...
It's polenta, though.

32:57.671 --> 32:59.064
Need that little
southern something

32:59.325 --> 33:00.674
so you don't have
a little situation this morning.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.154
I don't know
how to do that, man.

33:02.328 --> 33:03.851
Let me get rid of these
for you.

33:04.025 --> 33:07.246
Don't worry, you have
a master chef in the house.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.770
- Tell these motherfuckers, man.
- Mm-mm.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.120
Morning, Papito.
This looks great.

33:12.294 --> 33:13.339
Yo, guys...

33:13.513 --> 33:14.731
- Morning, waddup?
- Waddup?

33:15.210 --> 33:15.950
...your grits
are getting cold, hurry up!

33:17.256 --> 33:18.387
Yo, everything all right?

33:18.561 --> 33:20.302
You disappeared
last night.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.652
I didn't disappear, I just...
Fuckin' toddies put me down,

33:22.826 --> 33:25.003
I don't know if it's like
sleep medicine or some shit,

33:25.177 --> 33:26.482
like, that shit
put me down.

33:27.135 --> 33:28.658
The toddies made you
fall asleep?

33:29.572 --> 33:31.139
What's wrong with me
going to sleep?

33:32.967 --> 33:34.621
- Hey, Nico?
- Yeah?

33:34.882 --> 33:37.754
Do you have, uh, whipped cream
to make, uh, Irish coffees?

33:38.146 --> 33:39.365
- Yeah.
- Hey!

33:39.539 --> 33:41.497
- Yeah, where?
- Morning, how you doing?

33:41.758 --> 33:44.109
Whoa, happy birthday,
you look like shit.

33:44.283 --> 33:45.327
Yeah, just...

33:46.241 --> 33:47.503
- Good morning, man.
- How'd you sleep?

33:47.677 --> 33:49.375
- Good, man. How about you?
- Pretty good.

33:49.549 --> 33:50.724
Pretty good.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.292
- Thank you.
- All for you, all of it.

33:54.249 --> 33:55.816
Hey, Nico,
is this expired?

33:55.990 --> 33:57.861
- What? What is it?
- Whipped cream,

33:58.123 --> 33:59.298
- is it expired?
- I don't know, check the expiration date.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.387
- Good morning, my man.
- How you doing?

34:01.561 --> 34:03.041
I'm good, how about you?

34:03.258 --> 34:04.694
Not too tight,
not too tight.

34:04.868 --> 34:06.522
- I'm doing okay.
- Happy birthday, man.

34:06.696 --> 34:08.306
- Thank you.
- I hope you enjoy.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.744
Did you, uh... Did you
take part in this?

34:10.918 --> 34:14.139
I did! So you finally get
to nourish yourself

34:14.313 --> 34:15.705
with some of my actual cuisine.

34:15.879 --> 34:18.186
You guys
want Irish coffee? Irish coffee?

34:18.491 --> 34:19.666
- Yeah.
- You want one?

34:19.840 --> 34:21.710
- Yeah.
- Not going to put you to sleep?

34:22.451 --> 34:24.149
Not when there's coffee
in it, man.

34:24.409 --> 34:25.715
Hey,
there's no green tea...

34:25.889 --> 34:27.065
I'm not gonna
tell you when.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.849
All right, all right.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.284
Nico, baby,
you want some?

34:30.590 --> 34:31.895
- It's strong, it's very strong.
- Nah?

34:33.505 --> 34:34.942
Can I get some of that
whipped cream?

34:35.116 --> 34:36.683
- Can I see that sugar?
- Oh, yeah.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.598
- Nico.
- Tell me when to stop.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.252
Fuck man, you put sugar
on your grits?

34:40.469 --> 34:42.167
- It's polenta.
- Same shit!

34:42.384 --> 34:43.951
Yeah, you never seen nobody
do this before?

34:44.212 --> 34:46.170
Yeah, I thought grits
was, like, a savory,

34:46.344 --> 34:47.563
salt and pepper thing,
no?

34:48.608 --> 34:49.522
I don't know, man,
some people...

34:49.696 --> 34:51.132
Is it like a family thing?

34:51.524 --> 34:53.830
Nah, some people like it sweet,
some people like it salty.

34:54.483 --> 34:56.224
I like both, me personally,
but, you know,

34:56.398 --> 34:58.008
I guess it just depends
on what I eat it with.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.923
- Right?
- But like, it's a war, like,

35:00.098 --> 35:02.491
some people really
take this serious.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.190
Yeah, like, sometimes
my Facebook explodes about it.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.539
Like, it's super,
super crazy.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.932
I'll see if I can
find something.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.543
You wouldn't believe
how far this goes.

35:15.069 --> 35:16.505
See?
They got Angela and Rachel.

35:16.679 --> 35:17.941
What was that?

35:18.464 --> 35:19.552
Just keep swiping.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.337
What's that?
What's that?

35:22.511 --> 35:24.165
- Oh, Rachel.
- Let me see this.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.341
That's good.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.825
- Let me see that.
- But it's an actual...

35:31.999 --> 35:35.089
Oh, no!

35:36.873 --> 35:38.136
That's funny.

35:39.572 --> 35:41.835
Oh, no!

35:42.009 --> 35:43.663
- Fucked with Michael.
- They got Michael!

35:43.837 --> 35:45.795
Now that's funny.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.146
That's not really fair, though,
is it, man?

35:48.320 --> 35:49.582
I mean, the guy's dead.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.453
He can't exactly call out
on that, can he?

35:51.801 --> 35:52.802
I want to try some of this sugar
on my grits. Let me try this.

35:52.976 --> 35:54.282
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

35:54.456 --> 35:55.501
Is this, like, a Rachel Dolezal
sort of thing?

35:55.675 --> 35:56.632
It's off limits to me?

35:56.806 --> 35:58.199
I won't tell.

35:58.373 --> 36:00.636
Yo, that's a brave...
This is a bold decision.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.986
What's up, motherfuckers?

36:03.161 --> 36:05.163
- Oh!
- Happy birthday!

36:05.685 --> 36:06.990
Hey!

36:07.208 --> 36:09.993
- When did you guys get back?
- Yo, hey!

36:10.168 --> 36:11.647
- Like two days ago.
- Really?

36:11.821 --> 36:12.866
Yeah.

36:13.475 --> 36:15.477
- What's up, my man?
- Glad you made it.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.218
- Dude.
- Roddy, what's up, man?

36:17.392 --> 36:19.002
John boy!
Good to see you again, bro.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.396
Yo, I got something for you.
A rock?

36:21.570 --> 36:23.746
It's not just a rock, man,
this is an Eleguá.

36:24.225 --> 36:25.487
- Fair warning.
- Elengua?

36:25.661 --> 36:27.620
- Eleguá.
- Pete, this is a fucking cursed

36:28.011 --> 36:31.145
voodoo doll that he stole
from the Havana forest.

36:31.319 --> 36:33.800
Wait, wait, you stole
a voodoo doll?

36:34.104 --> 36:36.498
He fucking stole it, it was a
fucking creepy ass forest.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.108
- They were everywhere, man.
- There was, like,

36:38.283 --> 36:39.501
- dead chickens around.
- They're not evil.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.111
- They're not evil.
- Happy birthday.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.156
Out of my fucking house,
put it out of my house.

36:42.330 --> 36:43.636
I'm not fucking around.

36:43.984 --> 36:44.767
It's weird,
I can't stop looking at it.

36:44.941 --> 36:45.942
It's kind of hypnotic.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.248
Really.
Ty, you want to see it?

36:47.422 --> 36:49.032
I don't fuck
with that shit.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.904
What the fuck
are you guys eating?

36:51.165 --> 36:52.862
- It's grits, polenta.
- Sit down.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.777
- Whatever, it's...
- Have some food.

36:54.951 --> 36:57.040
I put sugar on mine,
it's kinda good.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.216
How you doing, bro?

36:58.390 --> 37:00.043
- Hey, what's your name?
- Tyler.

37:00.348 --> 37:01.654
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.395
Hey, what's up man?
I didn't see you there.

37:03.569 --> 37:04.831
- What's up? Eli.
- Tyler.

37:05.005 --> 37:06.224
Tyler.
Nice to meet you.

37:06.398 --> 37:07.964
Guys, let's take it to go.

37:08.138 --> 37:09.314
- Let's put it in a thermos.
- Where are we going?

37:09.488 --> 37:10.793
We just got here.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.360
Put 'em in thermos,
let's go. I know.

37:12.534 --> 37:13.709
But let's go
for a little walk.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.145
We're going to do
a little exercise.

37:15.363 --> 37:16.625
Little Johnny's gotta work
them buns.

37:16.799 --> 37:17.887
Okay, well, let them have
a drink first.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.541
- Come on.
- We're done here?

37:19.933 --> 37:20.760
- Yeah, we're done.
- Been driving for hours

37:20.934 --> 37:21.804
now, it's not a bad idea.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.285
Which one...
Which room's mine?

37:25.025 --> 37:26.635
I think for us
it's like 80/20.

37:26.809 --> 37:28.028
More, More.
Stronger, stronger.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.291
Whoa, enough, enough,
enough, enough.

37:30.465 --> 37:31.510
Sorry, sorry.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.990
- Puerto Rico. Nice.
- Yeah, that's where she's from.

37:34.164 --> 37:35.775
Yeah, she's from Puerto Rico.

37:35.949 --> 37:38.081
How long... How long have you
been, like, with her?

37:38.256 --> 37:41.171
Um... Going on three years now.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.695
- That's cool, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.134
- Oh, yeah, sure, thank you.
- Cheers.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.267
- You got an extra glass?
- Thank you, Nico.

37:49.441 --> 37:50.311
Thank you.

37:50.485 --> 37:51.573
Happy birthday, Pete.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.140
Yeah.

37:53.532 --> 37:56.404
Pete, cheers
to a beautiful fucking day.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.537
Here's to your
white floors, Nico.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.190
- Now let's exercise.
- Cheers to my white floors.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.018
Cheers.
Come on, guys.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.586
All right, let's go.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.719
Right, so right between
this valley and that valley

38:06.893 --> 38:08.634
- there's a little river...
- Yeah, yeah.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.070
...and you just
go up there.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.680
You go up, like,
about ten minutes.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.467
And then, uh,
it's there.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.033
That shit, like, catapults you.

38:17.207 --> 38:19.645
That sounds like
so much fun.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.821
And there, that's the...

38:22.561 --> 38:23.779
Fuck!

38:24.214 --> 38:25.564
So how was Cuba, man?

38:25.912 --> 38:28.654
It was dope,
hottest girls ever.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.004
- Ladies are hot there?
- Yeah.

38:31.178 --> 38:32.658
A lot hotter than here.

38:36.052 --> 38:37.402
Hey, Eli...

38:39.099 --> 38:40.492
You're not supposed
to smoke, man.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.537
You've had appendicitis,
you can't smoke weed.

38:42.711 --> 38:44.060
You can't smoke weed
with appendi...

38:44.234 --> 38:45.366
It's nothing to do
with your appendix,

38:45.540 --> 38:46.585
you smoke it
through the lungs.

38:46.759 --> 38:47.629
Yo, line up!
One line,

38:47.803 --> 38:48.891
everyone facing that way.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.545
- Come on.
- Nico, Johnny's told ya, move.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.112
Looking after your health,
dude.

38:52.286 --> 38:53.896
- Go, Roddy, make it.
- What are we doing?

38:54.114 --> 38:55.376
What are you talking
about, "what are we doing?"

38:55.550 --> 38:57.204
Remember we said.
Let's go, let's go, yo.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.075
Come on, baby.
We're doing it.

38:59.249 --> 39:00.947
- Nah, I don't want to play this game, man.
- Huh?

39:01.121 --> 39:02.427
- You're doing it.

39:02.601 --> 39:03.863
What do you mean?
Come on, we said...

39:04.124 --> 39:05.081
I don't wanna play every game
y'all play bro.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.302
Yo, we're not playing a game,
we're doing a workout.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.086
- We said we were going to do it.
- I'm chilling.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.392

39:12.480 --> 39:14.569
Yo, line up. Come on.

Drink it up.

39:16.615 --> 39:17.920
All right, yo.
Line it up, line it up.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.792
Thirty seconds of work,
30 seconds of rest.

39:19.966 --> 39:21.010
You get what I'm saying?

39:21.184 --> 39:22.664
I'll time it, don't worry.

39:22.838 --> 39:24.144
- What's the...?
- First exercise is frog jumps.

39:24.318 --> 39:25.450
- Frog jumps.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.497
Johnny Tundra.

39:31.107 --> 39:32.021

39:33.762 --> 39:34.894
Take the cigarette
out of your mouth.

39:37.157 --> 39:38.332
Thirty seconds!

39:38.898 --> 39:42.118
- Twenty-nine...
- No, come on.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.033
Anybody bring
any weed over?

39:44.425 --> 39:46.688
- Yo, just fucking...
- I knew this shit was bad.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.473
- Done, it's done.
- Weed break, weed break.

39:48.647 --> 39:49.822
Yo, Ty!

39:50.431 --> 39:51.301
Smoke smoke?

39:55.175 --> 39:56.176

39:56.394 --> 39:58.091
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...

39:59.397 --> 40:00.485
Yo!

40:00.833 --> 40:02.051
Give me
some of that shit.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.618
- Hey, man.
- Hey, dude.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.838
Hits the system up here...

40:11.583 --> 40:12.801
It's actually a hybrid,

40:13.106 --> 40:14.847
I think its blue dream...

40:26.032 --> 40:29.035
It's hard to tell
when it's going crisscross.

40:30.297 --> 40:31.341
Fuck, its cold!

40:31.516 --> 40:32.865
Criss-cross.

40:33.082 --> 40:35.345
Aah! Get those blue dreams...

40:37.739 --> 40:40.438
I lost my papers,
he's like, "I lost my weed."

40:40.612 --> 40:42.048
What is it, "I got weed,

40:42.222 --> 40:43.615
I got papers,
let's get it together man..."

40:43.789 --> 40:44.703
Max.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.536
...happy and the other one is
kinda like... not sad,

40:51.710 --> 40:53.320
or anything
but just kinda mellow.

40:54.408 --> 40:56.149
Woah!

40:56.454 --> 40:58.151
Sick.
Did you take my lighter?

40:58.325 --> 41:01.110
Yo, why were you just about to
punch me in the face just then?

41:02.677 --> 41:04.374
My bad, bro, I just...

41:04.549 --> 41:06.159
I just didn't want to play
the game, you know. I'm sorry.

41:06.333 --> 41:07.856
What, are you
freaking out right now?

41:08.030 --> 41:09.989
Is that why last night
you pretended to fall asleep?

41:10.163 --> 41:11.294
Pretending to be asleep?

41:11.469 --> 41:12.861
Come on, man, seriously?

41:13.035 --> 41:14.515
Why would I do that, bro?

41:14.689 --> 41:17.692
Yo, you were definitely
pretending to fall asleep.

41:18.563 --> 41:21.522
Why are you making shit weirder
than it already is, bro?

41:22.610 --> 41:24.003
Why is it weird
in the first place?

41:25.570 --> 41:27.354
Well, your fucking friend
Pete for one.

41:27.572 --> 41:29.443
Oh, come on, dude,

41:29.617 --> 41:32.054
I told you that Pete's
just a weirdo, you know that.

41:32.620 --> 41:33.752
He doesn't mean anything
by it.

41:33.926 --> 41:35.536
I get it, like a...
like an artist

41:35.710 --> 41:36.798
or some weird shit,

41:37.016 --> 41:38.713
- fucking weird.
- Yeah.

41:39.105 --> 41:41.586
But honestly, dude, would you
rather be here with us

41:41.760 --> 41:43.239
or would you rather be
at home

41:43.457 --> 41:44.850
dealing with Carmen's family
and all that shit, huh?

41:46.068 --> 41:48.810
Um... No, I'm fucking
with you, man.

41:48.984 --> 41:51.247
Let's go take this tour, man.
I wanna see this house.

41:51.726 --> 41:53.467
Nico builds these shits himself,
or what?

41:53.728 --> 41:55.425
Yeah, well, he's, I mean,
he's gutting them,

41:55.643 --> 41:57.776
I mean, these houses were here
for a while, but he's...

41:57.950 --> 42:01.040
So this house and
that house and 36 acres.

42:01.214 --> 42:03.303
- Wow!
- And I got it for 150,000 bucks.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.740
- No!
- Good one.

42:05.914 --> 42:08.656
Yeah, I... I think that
if I do this work,

42:08.830 --> 42:11.267
it looks good, I can get like
a $300,000 maybe,

42:11.441 --> 42:12.965
- $250,000, $300,000.
- You're gonna sell the house?

42:13.139 --> 42:14.793
No, you can get more
than that Nico!

42:15.271 --> 42:17.491
I don't know if I'm gonna sell
it, man, it seems really good,

42:17.665 --> 42:19.928
Seems beautiful but...
good profit.

42:20.102 --> 42:21.669
You're gonna put a window
right here?

42:21.843 --> 42:23.584
I'm gonna put a window
there, a fireplace...

42:23.758 --> 42:26.239
Don't you need, like, a
special permit for a wood stove?

42:26.413 --> 42:28.023
Yeah, but here, you're in
the middle of nowhere,

42:28.197 --> 42:29.416
you know, so nobody cares.

42:29.590 --> 42:30.722
- Oh, all right.
- Yeah.

42:30.896 --> 42:32.288
No one cares, huh?

42:33.768 --> 42:35.291
We're not gonna see you,

42:35.465 --> 42:37.076
you're never gonna be back
in the city, are you?

42:41.210 --> 42:43.169
So no bedrooms
downstairs, Nico, or what?

42:43.343 --> 42:44.866
Ah, no, maybe...

42:45.040 --> 42:46.389
...I don't know.
This is gonna be the kitchen,

42:46.825 --> 42:47.913
that's all I know now.

42:48.435 --> 42:51.394
I got two guys, you know,
I'll get it done.

42:51.786 --> 42:53.005
Yo, you okay?

42:54.136 --> 42:56.182
Yeah just trying
to check some e-mails.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.619
Yeah, it's fucked,
there's no service.

43:00.534 --> 43:02.449
Yo, Charles, what was the name
of that weed

43:02.623 --> 43:04.190
we were smoking earlier,
blue dream?

43:04.582 --> 43:05.974
The blue dream!

43:06.148 --> 43:07.454
You've got Tyler
tripping balls over here.

43:07.628 --> 43:08.803
What, is he
in the baby room?

43:08.977 --> 43:10.588
He's in the baby room.

43:10.936 --> 43:13.199
Di - de - di - de - di - de!

43:13.460 --> 43:14.722
Ah, fuck, sorry, sorry.

43:14.940 --> 43:16.594
- Sorry.
- Come on.

43:17.377 --> 43:18.770
- Nice, nice!
- Oh!

43:19.031 --> 43:21.120
Come on!

43:21.511 --> 43:24.384
- What is that?
- Uh, it's, uh, 17-12.

43:24.558 --> 43:26.038
Yo, Ty, you wanna play?

43:26.691 --> 43:28.431
Nah, I'm good man, I'll just...
I'll watch.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.911
- All right, go.
- Yo, Tyler,

43:30.085 --> 43:31.783
give a hand with this, man.
Aw, yeah, shit.

43:31.957 --> 43:32.914
Hell yeah.

43:33.436 --> 43:34.960
- Right on the pile.
- All right.

43:36.048 --> 43:38.180
Seventeen - 14.

43:42.532 --> 43:44.404
Motherfucker took an Uber!

43:44.665 --> 43:46.014
This little shit took an Uber!

43:46.362 --> 43:48.451
- Is that Alan?
- Rich-ass motherfucker!

43:48.800 --> 43:49.975
Can you believe this shit?

43:51.890 --> 43:53.239
What the fuck
is he wearing?

43:53.413 --> 43:56.024
Hey, nobody say shit
about the mask, okay?

43:56.372 --> 43:58.026
Johnny, right.
Don't say shit.

43:58.984 --> 44:00.376
Ruben, you're a prince, man.

44:00.812 --> 44:02.335
Best three hours of my week.

44:02.596 --> 44:03.989
Muchas gracias.

44:04.163 --> 44:05.294
Be good.

44:07.601 --> 44:09.908
How much that cost you?
Huh? 500?

44:10.212 --> 44:12.911
What are talking about, the car
or my sequins mask?

44:13.259 --> 44:14.608
Why're you so obsessed
with money, man,

44:14.782 --> 44:16.262
is it 'cause
you grew up poor?

44:16.654 --> 44:18.568
We all gonna hear about your sad
childhood again this weekend?

44:18.743 --> 44:20.222
Happy birthday.
I love you, man.

44:20.396 --> 44:22.181
I love you too, asshole.

44:23.617 --> 44:25.575
Pete, what is this
for a weird group?

44:25.837 --> 44:27.490
What?
Charlie, you look heavy!

44:27.665 --> 44:29.014
I love you as a fat guy.

44:29.188 --> 44:30.929
God, there's no balance here.
Where's Derek?

44:31.103 --> 44:32.800
Oh, hey, he couldn't come.
I'm sorry it's just us.

44:32.974 --> 44:34.454
Don't be sorry, man,
you're one of the good ones.

44:34.628 --> 44:35.803
- Who's this guy?
- This is my buddy,

44:35.977 --> 44:37.283
- we work together.
- No!

44:37.457 --> 44:38.719
Give me a hug, stranger.
Put that shit away.

44:38.937 --> 44:40.155
Sorry, man. I'm a hugger.

44:40.329 --> 44:41.504
Nico! Beautiful!

44:41.679 --> 44:43.115
Hey! Hey!

44:43.289 --> 44:45.508
What's this? Hey!
This for me?

44:45.683 --> 44:47.162
That's for all of us, man!

44:47.423 --> 44:48.773
- Not my birthday present?
- You have to share.

44:48.947 --> 44:50.078
It's for all the boys.

44:50.296 --> 44:51.819
It's gonna be fun for everyone.

44:52.080 --> 44:53.212
Here, check this out.

44:53.386 --> 44:54.822
What'd you bring,
a corpse?

44:55.083 --> 44:56.476
It will be soon, baby,
we're gonna kill it.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.261
Aw, shit.

44:59.784 --> 45:02.743
You see this tiny stubby finger?
This is gonna be pressed up

45:02.917 --> 45:05.659
inside of all of our asses
for the next four years.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.879
And we've gotta
fucking deal with it.

45:08.183 --> 45:09.750
- Where's the candy?
- No, no candy.

45:09.924 --> 45:12.144
No need for candy, man,
we'll just beat him up

45:12.318 --> 45:13.885
and stab him a little.
It'll be fun.

45:14.059 --> 45:15.582
You'll love it, especially you.

45:15.756 --> 45:17.758
Don't you wanna hurt
this racist motherfucker!

45:18.454 --> 45:19.804
Be fun, man,
but I'll get you some candy,

45:19.978 --> 45:21.196
I'll get you candy, all right?

45:21.370 --> 45:22.850
- We got candy, okay?
- Okay.

45:23.024 --> 45:24.460
I didn't mean to leave
the candy behind.

45:24.634 --> 45:26.419
Nico, where is
that swimming hole?

45:26.593 --> 45:28.160
The hole? Couple of hundred feet
that way, man.

45:28.334 --> 45:30.684
Can we go right now?
I wanna jump in that shit.

45:30.858 --> 45:32.860
- I... I gotta win a bet.
- It's too cold to do that, man.

45:33.034 --> 45:34.122
No, no.
Cold is just a temperature.

45:34.296 --> 45:35.689
- Can we go?
- Yeah. Sure.

45:35.994 --> 45:37.299
Let's get changed real quick
and we'll go, all right?

45:37.473 --> 45:39.127
- Right away?
- Yeah, right away.

45:39.301 --> 45:40.825
The crowd was
unbelievable today.

45:40.999 --> 45:42.565
You know,
I looked at the rain...

45:42.783 --> 45:44.219
- Jesus! God damnit!
- ...which just never came.

45:44.393 --> 45:46.178
You know,
we finished the speech.

45:47.309 --> 45:48.441
This motherfucker.

45:49.094 --> 45:50.356
Motherfucker.

45:51.009 --> 45:53.272
This guy says that it got sunny,
that the sun opened up, right,

45:53.446 --> 45:54.926
and there's fucking
footage of him

45:55.100 --> 45:56.405
giving his fascist speech
in the fucking rain.

45:56.579 --> 45:58.277
Yeah, for the
inauguration, right?

45:58.451 --> 46:00.322
Okay, so that's lying about
the fucking weather, right?

46:00.496 --> 46:02.672
- Yeah.
- It's fucking impeachment!

46:02.890 --> 46:04.283
Watch, the knife, bro,
watch the knife.

46:04.457 --> 46:05.545
Stab him in the dick.

46:06.546 --> 46:08.374
Stab it in the dick.

46:08.548 --> 46:10.115
- Stab him in the dick.
- Woah.

46:10.289 --> 46:11.464
- Stab him in the dick.
- Slow.

46:13.553 --> 46:15.207
Yeah. Now we can
grab him by the pussy, right?

46:15.381 --> 46:16.295
Action!

46:17.775 --> 46:20.299
Oh, my God,
Alan, so sexy!

46:20.473 --> 46:22.475
How many fucking costumes
you got?

46:22.649 --> 46:24.346
Huh, Mary Poppins?

46:24.520 --> 46:25.913
You see, Tyler, you're not
the only black man here now.

46:26.087 --> 46:28.089
Thanks to you my brother!

46:28.568 --> 46:30.004
This dude is funny!

46:30.483 --> 46:31.658
That's my nigga for life.

46:31.832 --> 46:33.573
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

46:33.747 --> 46:37.142
Come on, Alan, kiss me,
kiss me for the camera.

46:37.446 --> 46:38.708
Don't fucking tell me
to smile,

46:38.883 --> 46:40.145
I've lost all feeling
in my face.

46:41.146 --> 46:42.756
You look like
a black dildo.

46:48.109 --> 46:49.415
Hey, did you tell them
to come out?

46:49.589 --> 46:51.243
- Yeah, man
- Pete: Where the fuck are they?

46:51.417 --> 46:52.635
Take it easy.

46:52.897 --> 46:53.680
They're all dressed,
ain't they?

46:55.160 --> 46:55.987
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop.

46:56.161 --> 46:57.379
Stop what, man?

46:57.684 --> 46:58.816
Stop! You asshole.

46:58.990 --> 46:59.991
- Stop.
- Shut the fuck up.

47:04.647 --> 47:05.953
Sorry.

47:06.171 --> 47:07.607
Guys, it's not exactly warm
out here.

47:07.912 --> 47:09.304
What is it exactly?

47:11.089 --> 47:12.655
No, no, no, no, come on.
Get in the van man,

47:12.830 --> 47:14.222
- you'll freeze your ass off.
- I wanna test

47:14.396 --> 47:16.094
wetsuit out, man.
It's an expensive rental.

47:16.268 --> 47:17.747
Ty,
come back with me, man!

47:17.965 --> 47:20.359
Fuck that!
It's a little cold back there,

47:20.533 --> 47:22.274
Be the man of the group,
come on.

47:22.448 --> 47:24.450
- Here, take that to warm up.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

47:24.624 --> 47:25.930
The brothers
are used to it anyway.

47:26.104 --> 47:27.366
We're men.

47:27.540 --> 47:28.367
We'll be the men
of the group.

47:30.238 --> 47:32.719
It's so hard to take you
seriously in this shit.

47:33.328 --> 47:35.896
You look like you're
on your way out of an asshole.

47:36.244 --> 47:38.507
And I don't want to come
out yet, I'm staying in.

47:40.248 --> 47:41.249
I don't wanna be born!

47:42.903 --> 47:43.904
Put me back.

47:45.471 --> 47:47.299
- How you doing, man?
- It's cold as a motherfucker.

47:47.473 --> 47:49.344
Oh, yeah? Get in here,
man, it's cozy in here.

47:49.692 --> 47:50.998
Come on, climb in.

47:51.172 --> 47:52.608
Let me touch this shit,
what is this?

47:52.782 --> 47:54.262
- It's rabbit.
- This is nice!

47:54.436 --> 47:56.830
It's like bunny fur,
it's like 40 baby rabbits.

47:57.004 --> 47:59.398
Very expensive, very rare.

48:00.268 --> 48:02.444
Drink up, man!
If you're feeling the cold,

48:02.618 --> 48:03.750
you're not drunk enough.
Come on.

48:03.924 --> 48:05.099
- Oh, man.
- Go till you can't

48:05.273 --> 48:06.361
feel a thing.

48:06.535 --> 48:07.841
Give it here.

48:08.059 --> 48:08.798
- What is that?
- Take a little sip of that.

48:08.973 --> 48:10.148
Irish coffee.

48:11.236 --> 48:12.193
It's good shit, man.

48:12.367 --> 48:13.847
That way we can be like drunk

48:14.021 --> 48:15.805
- but capable.
- They make it nice and strong.

48:16.415 --> 48:17.982
Yeah. That's what I'm trying
to get to, man.

48:18.417 --> 48:19.766
I wanna feel alive.

48:21.028 --> 48:22.595
Is that why you're doing this
with me?

48:22.769 --> 48:24.031
To do this fucking bet?

48:24.858 --> 48:29.602
It's a lot, man, enough that
I rented a wetsuit for two days.

48:30.211 --> 48:33.301
But I made it with this guy
who pisses money away,

48:33.475 --> 48:35.738
does not give a shit
about money, he was drunk,

48:36.000 --> 48:36.914
it's easy money.

48:39.612 --> 48:42.397
Whoa! Whoa!
Watch out, man! It's slippery!

48:42.571 --> 48:44.051
Yo, Ty,
you got the thermos?

48:44.269 --> 48:45.531
I know what I'm doing.
Thank you very much!

48:46.184 --> 48:47.359
Oh, sorry.

48:47.533 --> 48:48.882
Charles, make sure
you're filming,

48:49.056 --> 48:50.536
man, there's a lot of money
on the line.

48:50.710 --> 48:52.407
- I got you, bro!
- Don't fuck me on this.

48:52.581 --> 48:53.843
Are there rocks down here?

48:54.322 --> 48:55.628
Yo, you drank the whole
thing, motherfucker.

48:56.150 --> 48:59.066
Nah, actually, uh, my nigga
helped me out with that.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.633
Just fish my body
out of the water.

49:00.850 --> 49:02.504
- All right.
- Witness my death.

49:02.678 --> 49:04.202
- I know, but fuck.
- Nico, how many feet?

49:04.376 --> 49:05.681
- Sorry, dawg.
- Like, four?

49:05.899 --> 49:06.813
Jump, you little
shrinking flower!

49:06.987 --> 49:08.206
All right, this is it!

49:08.380 --> 49:09.511
Sayonara!

49:12.427 --> 49:14.734
- I got it.
- Oh, this fucking suit!

49:14.908 --> 49:16.823
Aah!

49:16.997 --> 49:18.216
Grab his jacket,
give me his clothes.

49:18.390 --> 49:19.913
I'm fucking...
Hypothermia!

49:20.087 --> 49:21.567
- My body's in shock!
- Are you all right?

49:21.741 --> 49:23.438
No, seriously,
I can't feel my skin!

49:23.612 --> 49:25.875
Help him out.

49:26.833 --> 49:27.790
I got you, man.

49:28.139 --> 49:29.662
What's going on?

49:30.010 --> 49:32.404
Help! Get this shit off me.
Holy fucking shit, I'm freezing!

49:32.665 --> 49:34.797
- Oh my... Fuck!
- Stop moving, man!

49:34.972 --> 49:36.669
Fucking suit is a scam,
I'm not joking.

49:36.843 --> 49:38.018
Stop flailing!

49:38.453 --> 49:39.933
It's not that cold, man,
get over it.

49:40.107 --> 49:41.239
How do you
work this shit?

49:41.413 --> 49:42.762
This shit's like
a bullet proof vest!

49:42.936 --> 49:44.024
I Velcro'd it.
What are you doing?

49:44.198 --> 49:45.504
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

49:46.200 --> 49:48.246
It's an illusion!

49:49.856 --> 49:51.510
- So dramatic!
- I got it.

49:51.684 --> 49:53.164
- Where the fuck's my coat, man?
- What do you mean?

49:53.338 --> 49:54.817
- Give me my fucking...
- What you talking about?

49:54.992 --> 49:56.384
When did you get a sex
change, anal?

49:56.558 --> 49:57.777
Yeah, my junk looks
like a pussy.

49:57.951 --> 49:59.387
It's really funny, motherfucker!

49:59.561 --> 50:01.259
I'm gonna rub my pussy
all over you fuckers!

50:01.433 --> 50:02.695
Give me body heat.

50:02.869 --> 50:04.218
Yo, I'm dying!

50:04.392 --> 50:05.915
Give him his shit,
man, give him his shit.

50:06.873 --> 50:08.875
- Man...
- Give me some body heat!

50:10.833 --> 50:12.574
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Cover him up, cover him up.

50:12.748 --> 50:14.924
Fuck! Jesus!
Don't hug me, still.

50:15.099 --> 50:16.274
The only man
with a fucking heart.

50:16.448 --> 50:17.971
Fuck you cunt bitches, man!

50:19.103 --> 50:21.453
I'm sorry, anal,
I didn't mean to make you hurt!

50:21.627 --> 50:22.976
Hey, fuck you, dude!

50:23.150 --> 50:24.891
Tyler, never trust
the white man.

50:25.065 --> 50:26.588
All right? You understand?

50:26.762 --> 50:28.721
They will let you fucking die
in the wilderness.

50:30.418 --> 50:31.724
- You hear me?
- Loud and clear.

50:33.595 --> 50:35.423
Let you die
in the fucking wilderness, man.

50:36.859 --> 50:38.122
- Drink to that.
- Hurry up.

50:38.296 --> 50:39.775
- Aah!
- Fucking cursed, man.

50:39.949 --> 50:41.690
- Look at me, look at me.
- Fucking cursed, man.

50:41.864 --> 50:43.214
I'm not fucking around.
You understand?

50:43.388 --> 50:44.867
I'll get that out
of your fucking house.

50:45.085 --> 50:46.434
- It is not cursed.
- What are you talking about?

50:49.785 --> 50:52.092
Hey, eat this entire stick
of butter for 300 bucks,

50:52.266 --> 50:53.920
and we'll find
desperate people,

50:54.094 --> 50:55.922
we'll just find someone to do it
until all the cash is gone.

50:56.096 --> 50:57.663
I'm gonna hold you
to that shit.

50:57.837 --> 50:59.665
We'll see some really sad
shit that way, it's fun.

50:59.839 --> 51:01.754
I would eat the butter
just for the pleasure.

51:01.928 --> 51:03.103
Have you ever done that?

51:03.277 --> 51:04.409
What else is there to do
with butter?

51:04.670 --> 51:06.411

Are you working here?

51:35.831 --> 51:37.268
Why don't you relax a bit?

51:37.442 --> 51:38.312
I know, right?
I should be on salary.

51:38.486 --> 51:39.966
Come on, take a break.

51:42.621 --> 51:44.449
Mmm! Mmm!

51:44.623 --> 51:45.624
Mmm!

51:45.798 --> 51:47.060
You want mine? You like it?

51:47.234 --> 51:48.540
- Yeah!
- I can't eat cheese.

51:48.714 --> 51:50.107
- I'm lactose intolerant, here.
- Cheese me.

51:50.324 --> 51:51.412
Go on, Tyler.

51:52.370 --> 51:53.371
Yes!

51:53.806 --> 51:54.676
Hey!

51:55.199 --> 51:56.896
Whoa, Jesus.

51:57.940 --> 51:59.290
Whoa, what?

51:59.594 --> 52:01.074
Don't be jealous
of our dynamic, okay?

52:01.248 --> 52:02.771
It's just like watching
a Sea World show.

52:02.945 --> 52:04.295
Hey, so, Eli, like, what are--
how are the Cuban people

52:04.469 --> 52:06.079
feeling about
all the election stuff?

52:06.253 --> 52:08.299
No, no, tell him
about the rock!

52:08.473 --> 52:10.518
Tell him about
the fucking Eleguá,

52:10.692 --> 52:12.564
- the fucking... a ghost rock.
- He doesn't know what it is.

52:12.738 --> 52:15.306
He stole this fucking
weird-ass voodoo doll thing,

52:15.480 --> 52:17.569
with, like,
this weird rock face.

52:17.743 --> 52:19.179
What, where is it,
I wanna see it, where is it?

52:19.353 --> 52:20.659
You don't wanna see it!
It'll fuck you up.

52:20.833 --> 52:22.356
Yeah, you do wanna see it,
it's good luck.

52:22.530 --> 52:23.966
No, don't tell him
to look at it.

52:24.141 --> 52:25.533
He tryna fuck your life up,
I'm telling you.

52:25.707 --> 52:27.013
It's not gonna
fuck your life up.

52:27.231 --> 52:28.667
Alan, listen to me,
it'll fuck your life up.

52:28.841 --> 52:30.103
I don't...
they don't give a fuck

52:30.277 --> 52:31.496
about anything anymore
over there.

52:31.670 --> 52:32.801
They just think
we're idiots.

52:32.975 --> 52:34.107
Well,
they think we're idiots,

52:34.281 --> 52:36.065
and I think that
they're just happy

52:36.240 --> 52:38.546
that they're not here as well,
you know what I mean? Yeah.

52:38.720 --> 52:40.200
You heard of those things
where you send

52:40.374 --> 52:42.420
your bullshit into?
You know that?

52:42.594 --> 52:44.770
Okay, so every... most major
cities and most states are...

52:44.944 --> 52:46.380
Where's that fucking bottle at?

52:46.554 --> 52:47.990
They want to take away
funding from the cities.

52:48.165 --> 52:50.428
This guy needs
another shot! Right?

52:50.602 --> 52:52.430
But yet he wants New York
to protect his family

52:52.604 --> 52:54.432
when they stay there
on the weekends. It's bullshit.

52:54.606 --> 52:57.304
Yo, Ty. Ty, that's Pete's
birthday bottle.

52:57.478 --> 53:00.264
- Don't be a fucking pussy.
- I know, but let him--

53:00.438 --> 53:01.787
Cheap fuck.

53:02.004 --> 53:03.876
Yo...

53:06.531 --> 53:08.185
Stop being cheap, buddy.

53:09.795 --> 53:11.318
Come on.
Cheers, motherfucker.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.364
All right.

53:13.538 --> 53:14.843
- They got Jet Blue flights...
- Cheers.

53:15.017 --> 53:17.542
...for like 150 bucks,
that's nothing!

53:17.759 --> 53:19.326
- Round trip, motherfucker.
- Right...

53:20.284 --> 53:21.894
Jet Blue sucks dick!

53:22.068 --> 53:24.201
- Ty, bring me Eleguá.
- I've got you!

53:24.462 --> 53:26.507
You have a Jewish vagina!

53:27.247 --> 53:28.727
Hey where's that Eleguá
thing at?

53:28.901 --> 53:30.903
Where's that Eleguá,
ghost rock thing?

53:31.164 --> 53:33.079
Yeah,
that's not here anymore!

53:33.340 --> 53:34.820
Yo, Tyler!

53:34.994 --> 53:36.561
Yo, Tyler. I dare you!

53:36.735 --> 53:37.997
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
- What the fuck?

53:38.302 --> 53:39.520
How much
of a man, are you?

53:40.260 --> 53:41.696
Oh, you wanna find out?
You wanna see my dick?

53:41.870 --> 53:43.655
There's not enough room
at the table.

53:43.959 --> 53:45.613
Here, sit down, sit down, sit down.

53:47.006 --> 53:48.442
We're playing
whiskey slaps.

53:48.616 --> 53:49.791
Have some water.

53:50.531 --> 53:53.142
- What, are you my mom now?
- No, I'm your daddy.

53:54.666 --> 53:56.494
Guys,
Tyler does not like games.

53:56.668 --> 53:58.017
No, never played
whiskey slaps, huh?

53:58.191 --> 54:00.019
'Course he hasn't,
you just made it up.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.325
Now...

54:02.151 --> 54:03.501
as soon as I take a drink,

54:03.675 --> 54:05.503
as soon as the ass of the glass
hits the wood,

54:05.677 --> 54:07.331
you slap me, understand?

54:07.505 --> 54:09.855
Don't be afraid, Tyler,
you slap this bitch hard.

54:10.029 --> 54:11.770
- Handle that?
- Yo, what you wanna do

54:11.944 --> 54:13.380
with this one,
wanna save it?

54:13.641 --> 54:16.209
Set it down, yeah. Set it down.
Put it on the table.

54:16.427 --> 54:17.341
Exactly.

54:17.819 --> 54:19.517
Here, sit down man.
You ready?

54:19.691 --> 54:21.519
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it. I'm first, okay?

54:21.693 --> 54:22.737
All right.

54:26.480 --> 54:27.612
Woah!

54:28.439 --> 54:30.615
Okay,
now we're going.

54:32.573 --> 54:34.793
- Oh. Shit's gonna get crazy.
- Come on!

54:37.491 --> 54:40.102
- Son of a bitch!
- All right, frat boys!

54:40.799 --> 54:42.366
All right, listen up,
listen up.

54:42.540 --> 54:44.368
- Motherfucker.
- You girls look super cute,

54:44.542 --> 54:46.021
but we gotta clean up.

54:46.239 --> 54:48.850
No, I gotta get my revenge.
Come on, sit back down!

54:49.024 --> 54:50.025
We gotta clean up.

54:50.199 --> 54:51.505
One more round,
one more round!

54:51.723 --> 54:54.682
No, guys, guys.
What the fuck man?

54:55.074 --> 54:56.989
- Tyler, yo, come on, man.
- You all right?

54:57.163 --> 54:58.338
Johnny, Johnny...

54:59.426 --> 55:00.906
I'm gonna get you back,
motherfucker.

55:01.080 --> 55:02.560
- Yeah, you will.
- I'm gonna get you back.

55:02.734 --> 55:04.083
I'm good, bro!

55:04.388 --> 55:05.563
I'm good, Johnny,
you don't gotta babysit me.

55:05.737 --> 55:07.129
I'm not babysitting you.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.566
Guys, why don't
we stop doing this?

55:08.740 --> 55:09.958
Hey! Yo!

55:10.437 --> 55:12.396
They're doing a capoeira
demonstration.

55:12.570 --> 55:14.267
I don't think this is really
how you do it.

55:14.441 --> 55:17.096
No, it's not from Cuba
or wherever the fuck

55:17.270 --> 55:19.490
these fucks came from,
this... it's from...

55:19.664 --> 55:20.969
it's from Brazil.

55:21.143 --> 55:22.406
- And it's a dance.
- All right,

55:22.580 --> 55:23.755
my neck is starting to hurt.

55:23.929 --> 55:25.452
Get out of here.
Do I gotta tag somebody?

55:25.626 --> 55:27.411
Come on, me and you,
me and you right now, right now.

55:27.585 --> 55:28.934
I don't wanna hurt
your fragile body.

55:29.108 --> 55:31.197
Come on, man,
I like this WWF stuff, man.

55:31.371 --> 55:32.894
- Come on, man, me and you.
- Nah, I'll pass, buddy. Nah.

55:33.068 --> 55:34.418
I'm not really good
with the...

55:36.202 --> 55:37.812
Hey, Ty, come on,
he's not gonna fight you.

55:37.986 --> 55:39.510
Like the WWE stuff.
Come on, man, me and you.

55:39.771 --> 55:41.120
Come on, he's a pussy.

55:41.294 --> 55:43.340
- Aw, man. Oh, you!
- Oh, shit!

55:43.514 --> 55:44.819
Oh, it's on!

55:46.299 --> 55:48.345
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

55:48.519 --> 55:49.737
Here we go, here we go.

55:49.911 --> 55:51.086
Make room, make room.

55:51.260 --> 55:53.001
Hey, whoa.
Make room, make room!

55:53.437 --> 55:55.090
Hey,
I got 50 bucks on Tyler!

55:55.308 --> 55:56.831
I got Tyler.

55:57.354 --> 55:59.094
Fine, I got 50 on Pete.

56:00.008 --> 56:02.881
Hey, Eli and Charles!
Eli, you got 50?

56:12.456 --> 56:14.849
All right, you win, you win.

56:15.023 --> 56:17.896
You giving up on me?
You giving up on me, you pussy?

56:18.070 --> 56:19.985
Pete, don't give up.
Oh, shit!

56:21.813 --> 56:23.467
All right, guys, guys...

56:26.078 --> 56:27.949
Wait, wait, wait,
guys, guys...

56:31.257 --> 56:33.172
What the fuck, man?
Cut it out, man!

56:33.520 --> 56:35.653
Tyler, you're fucking wasted,
man.

56:35.827 --> 56:37.306
- I'm sorry.
- Get up, get up.

56:37.481 --> 56:38.830
Look at this fucking shit,
man.

56:39.396 --> 56:42.007
- Yo, I'm sorry.
- Fucking get your shit together, man.

56:42.181 --> 56:43.791
I'll pay for it, I'm sorry.

56:44.183 --> 56:45.880
No, for real, I've got a cash
app, I can pay you right now.

56:46.054 --> 56:47.142
Tyler, it's all right,
it's all right.

56:47.316 --> 56:48.709
I'm so sorry, bro.

56:48.970 --> 56:50.319
Don't worry. It's just
a record player, man.

56:50.494 --> 56:52.278
Don't worry, don't worry.

56:52.452 --> 56:53.975
Nico, I'm sorry, bro.

56:54.149 --> 56:55.455
It's fine, it's fine,
it's fine.

56:55.629 --> 56:57.109
But really, like,
get your shit together.

56:57.283 --> 56:59.328
- Tyler, relax.
- It's all good.

56:59.851 --> 57:02.506
Like, let's settle down
a little bit, all right?

57:02.723 --> 57:04.769
- It's just a record player, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

57:04.943 --> 57:06.510
- I never lost faith in you.
- I don't care whose fault it is,

57:06.684 --> 57:08.033
like, let's just
get it over with.

57:08.207 --> 57:10.427
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

57:12.298 --> 57:13.821
- Dinner's ready.
- Yeah, yeah.

57:13.995 --> 57:15.867
Make yourselves
presentable, come on.

57:17.042 --> 57:20.915
Okay. I wanna say something
really quickly

57:21.089 --> 57:22.656
before we start eating!

57:24.049 --> 57:26.007
I wanted to say just one thing.

57:26.791 --> 57:28.575
Thank you
for having us here.

57:28.749 --> 57:31.665
Thank you for all your fuckers
coming, I know it was tough.

57:33.101 --> 57:34.712
But last year was fucked.

57:35.321 --> 57:36.583
And I...

57:38.193 --> 57:39.673
at some point...

57:40.718 --> 57:43.372
I have needed every single
fucking one of you...

57:44.373 --> 57:46.027
and you've been there
for me.

57:47.333 --> 57:49.074
Every single
fucking one of you.

57:49.770 --> 57:51.859
And that's what this is about,
that's what it's all...

57:52.033 --> 57:53.557
that's what all of this shit
is about.

57:53.731 --> 57:55.080
All right?

57:55.254 --> 57:56.603
So anyways,
that's all I wanted to say.

57:56.777 --> 57:58.605
- To the women's march!
- Happy birthday.

57:58.779 --> 58:00.302
- To the women's march.
- You cynical motherfucker!

58:00.477 --> 58:02.130
Thank you, Pete,
really funny speech!

58:06.004 --> 58:08.615
Happy to be here,
why is it cynical to love women?

58:08.963 --> 58:10.356
- Cheers!
- We've seen some shit, huh?

58:10.530 --> 58:11.923
- Let's go.
- Let me play now.

58:12.140 --> 58:15.187
Okay, okay,
now spin, spin, spin.

58:15.753 --> 58:17.798
All right, that's good!
Let's go, let's go.

58:17.972 --> 58:20.018
- Give it to him.
- Where's the fucking machete?

58:20.192 --> 58:22.368
- On the table!
- Just, uh, go straight.

58:22.542 --> 58:23.761
You have three times.

58:25.371 --> 58:28.722
Go, go.
Go, go.

58:28.896 --> 58:30.594
Don't lean against him,
he gotta figure it out.

58:30.768 --> 58:33.074
- Yeah, am I there?
- You're... You're near.

58:33.771 --> 58:35.294
Fuck him up!

58:40.255 --> 58:41.169
Get him!

58:43.258 --> 58:44.477
Yeah, motherfucker!

58:46.784 --> 58:48.960
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

58:52.572 --> 58:53.878
Hey, John.

58:54.356 --> 58:56.358
Look, we was fucking
around back there, man.

58:56.533 --> 58:58.056
You know... You know
I'm not violent.

58:58.230 --> 59:00.188
You know
I'm not fucked up.

59:00.362 --> 59:02.669
Yo, don't sweat it, don't
sweat it at all, man.

59:02.843 --> 59:07.195
Hey, Nico, Nico...
Let me pay for the...

59:07.369 --> 59:09.720
Yo, stop it.
Cut it out, man.

59:09.894 --> 59:11.156
Don't worry about,
it's all good.

59:13.985 --> 59:17.379
- All right, all right
- John: My man, Ty.

59:17.554 --> 59:19.425
My man Ty's gonna get it.

59:19.599 --> 59:20.905
Give me that machete.

59:21.688 --> 59:23.864
Kill the Trump,
kill the Trump.

59:24.038 --> 59:25.997
- Give me the machete.
- Spin him!

59:26.171 --> 59:28.913
Spin him! Spin him!

59:29.087 --> 59:30.784
That's all right,
that's all right.

59:30.958 --> 59:32.656
- Wait.
- Woah, woah, woah!

59:32.960 --> 59:34.179
Oh, shit.

59:34.483 --> 59:36.442
What are you fucking
talking about?

59:37.835 --> 59:39.271
Yo, yo, Ty, you good?

59:39.576 --> 59:41.186
He's gonna fucking puke,
right?

59:41.447 --> 59:42.666
- You good?
- Don't puke, man, don't puke.

59:42.840 --> 59:44.102
Are you gonna be sick?

59:44.363 --> 59:45.756
Tyler, look at me,
are you gonna be sick?

59:46.017 --> 59:48.149
I'm okay, I'm okay. I just need
to take a shower, bro.

59:48.323 --> 59:49.673
You wanna take a shower?
Come upstairs.

59:50.325 --> 59:51.675
It's all right, it's cool.
We'll go upstairs

59:51.849 --> 59:53.024
and take a shower.
Come on.

59:53.198 --> 59:54.329
I'll make you some coffee,
okay?

59:54.503 --> 59:55.896
All right, all right.

59:56.114 --> 59:57.594
- You're my babies.
- Yeah, go, go.

59:57.811 --> 59:59.552
- You're my babies.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go.

59:59.857 --> 01:00:01.249
Take care of yourself.

01:00:01.554 --> 01:00:02.903
Maybe we should've put some
candy in that thing.

01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:11.216
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

01:00:58.089 --> 01:00:59.568
Yo!

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:00.918
Hey, my bad.

01:01:01.092 --> 01:01:02.267
Max is using
the bathroom downstairs.

01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:05.096
Oh, and Nico says you gotta
keep the showers short.

01:01:06.401 --> 01:01:08.273
There isn't much water in
the tank, some shit like that,

01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:09.317
I don't fucking know.

01:01:21.068 --> 01:01:22.461
Oh, yo,
we okay, right?

01:01:23.114 --> 01:01:24.855
I was just fucking
around before, all right?

01:01:25.594 --> 01:01:26.770
Yeah, we're real.

01:01:27.205 --> 01:01:28.859
- Yep.
- Okay!

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:42.873
Shit.
Fuck!

01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:46.224
Bitches!

01:01:46.398 --> 01:01:48.443
Fuck 'em!

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:51.185
Cheap-ass motherfucker.

01:01:54.536 --> 01:01:56.930
He wrote this note to all these
convents in Argentina, like,

01:01:57.104 --> 01:01:59.237
all these nuns, like, "We have
to pray against gay marriage,"

01:01:59.411 --> 01:02:00.717
like
"This is the devil's work,

01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:02.414
this is evil,
we have to pray against it,"

01:02:02.588 --> 01:02:04.329
and then seven years later,
it was like the church

01:02:04.503 --> 01:02:05.852
- should apologize to gay people.
- Right, right.

01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:07.767
This is our Pope,
he's like the fresh...

01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:09.551
It's horrible,
it's horrible...

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.728
- Like the fresh, young, cool new Pope...
- My man...

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:13.425
- You good?
- ...like Rolling Stone magazine put him on.

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:14.818
You know, just because
you're not a Nazi

01:02:14.992 --> 01:02:16.471
doesn't mean
you're a good person.

01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:17.864
He's going around giving an
apology toward people

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:19.779
who don't believe in Him
and don't care.

01:02:23.696 --> 01:02:25.219
Ooh.
You smell like almonds.

01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:26.438
You made that coffee?

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.136
Oh, fuck, yo,
I forgot to save you a cup.

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:30.659
Oh, no shit.

01:02:30.877 --> 01:02:32.313
What do you mean,
"no shit"?

01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:33.793
I was just going to make
more coffee, man.

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:35.534
- Here just, have mine.
- Nah, I'm good.

01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:37.579
Dude, it's fine, here,
I'll make a new pot of coffee.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.146
- I'm good.
- I'll make a new pot of coffee.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.800
Would you just take that?
Stop being a bitch

01:02:40.974 --> 01:02:42.106
and drink that, all right?
I'll make another pot,

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.195
don't worry.
We got any more coffee?

01:02:46.153 --> 01:02:47.938
The imagery of it
is all bloody.

01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:49.809
If Jesus were here, he would
fucking be over it himself.

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:51.637
Oh, my God, he would
hate it! He would hate it!

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:54.509
It's all just a bunch
of rapey bullshit.

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.250
If Jesus went
into a church, he'd be like,

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:57.730
"What the fuck
are you doing?

01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:59.123
Why am I bleeding,
with a thorny crown...?"

01:02:59.297 --> 01:03:00.559
Like,
"Put me on rollerblades!"

01:03:00.733 --> 01:03:01.778
It's like a horror show!

01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:03.431
Absolutely, I know!

01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:08.436
Ty. Remember
when we were all having fun?

01:03:09.307 --> 01:03:11.352
Now it's turned
into a fucking fiasco.

01:03:11.526 --> 01:03:12.789
I know!
It always does.

01:03:12.963 --> 01:03:14.442
That's where
it always goes.

01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:16.705
It's like religion, politics,
religion, politics.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.011
- This is what happens.
- Yo Alan.

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:19.447
What are you doing?

01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:21.536
Why do you have that?
What is that?

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.408
The fucking hoarders
that lived here had it.

01:03:23.582 --> 01:03:25.236
- What are you doing, man?
- They had like ten of them.

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:26.846
- Here.
- I can't with you guys.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.543
Why haven't you
thrown it away?

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.502
Okay, so, like,
what is happening here?

01:03:30.676 --> 01:03:32.721
Like, why is it so scary?

01:03:32.939 --> 01:03:34.636
This baby's like a demon baby.
He's, like, about

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.247
to take a bite
out of her face.

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:37.988
No, you know what,
come in the living room

01:03:38.162 --> 01:03:39.511
- if you want to have fun, okay?
- What is this?

01:03:39.685 --> 01:03:41.034
Why is he about to take a bite
out of her?

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:43.254
And, like, the baby
doesn't weigh anything.

01:03:43.428 --> 01:03:45.082
- It's like they're gonna make out or something.
- Yeah!

01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:47.867
What about the Jesus? The
unfuckable Jesus right there?

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:50.087
Why is Jesus always
with a lamb?

01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:52.002
Like, what does the lamb mean?
It means nothing!

01:03:52.176 --> 01:03:53.394
It means
its mother's missing.

01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:54.787
Like, Tyler, why...
what is this?

01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:56.441
Is Jesus
running a petting zoo?

01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:58.443
What are you supposed to think
when you see this?

01:03:58.617 --> 01:04:02.621
Why, in 2017 are people,
like, in love with this imagery?

01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:05.493
- Why is it 2017 in the first place?
- Yeah!

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:08.757
Like, why are people posting
this to their wall and crying?

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.064
Anyone who believes
in this kind of Jesus

01:04:11.238 --> 01:04:13.240
must be,
like, an inferior human.

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:16.548
I don't want these people
voting, or touching me...

01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:18.245
Let's hire an actor...

01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:20.247
Guys, why don't we go to
the fire and burn all this shit?

01:04:26.993 --> 01:04:29.517
Please, can I just ask,
no more Cuba stories?

was blocked in...

you don't have to stand up,
sit down, sit down.

01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:50.191

- You know, maybe

01:12:53.543 --> 01:12:54.674
- this was a bad idea...
- ...this is my guest.

01:12:54.848 --> 01:12:56.328
- I'm so sorry.
- No, just sit down.

- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm so sorry, guys.

01:12:58.635 --> 01:13:00.245

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:49.555

- Let's go to sleep,

01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:51.252
- what do you figure?
- Goodnight, Devon.

01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:53.167
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a great night.

01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:55.692

a baritone saxophone, kiddo.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.391

What's going on?

01:16:24.536 --> 01:16:26.016
Why do you have your shit?

01:16:27.539 --> 01:16:29.062
I pretended to be asleep.

01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:31.456
I don't know.

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:32.849
Like...

01:16:33.153 --> 01:16:34.851
I don't know why I would pretend
to be asleep...

01:16:35.025 --> 01:16:36.766
I really don't know.

01:16:39.464 --> 01:16:40.987
Is that
what you're upset about?

01:16:42.989 --> 01:16:45.905
- Are you scared?
- I'm not really sure.

01:16:46.079 --> 01:16:47.298
I fucking knew
you weren't sleeping!

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:48.516
I don't know
what's going on.

01:16:48.691 --> 01:16:49.779
All right, yo, yo, yo!

01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:51.781
Okay.
Are you okay?

01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:54.697
I'm fucking drunk.

01:16:55.828 --> 01:16:57.961
All right, here, come on,
come to the car.

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:01.878
It's all right.

01:17:07.927 --> 01:17:10.451
It's just not smart to do this
when you're drunk, you know?

01:17:10.887 --> 01:17:12.149
Come on.

01:17:13.803 --> 01:17:15.979
All right, here we go.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.545
You good?

01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:19.460
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.724
Glad we fucking
found you, man!

01:17:23.247 --> 01:17:24.727
I was fucking scared!

01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:26.293
Enough, dude.

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:28.295
We knew you were out here
calling, man, don't worry.

01:17:28.861 --> 01:17:30.297
A little walk, huh?

01:17:30.602 --> 01:17:32.865
Yeah,
just looking for service.

01:17:59.196 --> 01:18:00.371
Hey, they're back!

01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:04.897
There he is.

01:18:06.377 --> 01:18:08.335
You guys all right?
You good?

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:10.250
Hey, motherfucker,
I didn't say you could

01:18:10.424 --> 01:18:13.906
keep my coat!
This one's not warm at all.

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:18.694
He's just a little drunk.
He was around the corner...

01:18:19.433 --> 01:18:21.697
Ty, I want my coat back, baby,
I don't care if you're cranky.

01:18:22.219 --> 01:18:23.524
Ohh.

01:18:24.874 --> 01:18:26.658
No, no.

01:18:28.965 --> 01:18:30.270
You okay, Ty?

01:18:33.578 --> 01:18:36.146
- I think he's really upset.
- Over what?

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.539
Mad at what?

01:18:38.888 --> 01:18:40.454
I don't know. Johnny said
he was drunk when they found him

01:18:40.628 --> 01:18:41.760
down the road.

01:18:41.934 --> 01:18:43.196
On foot?

01:18:51.117 --> 01:18:53.946
Put your shit down,
take your jacket off,

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.556
get some rest.

01:18:59.822 --> 01:19:02.085
I'll come check in on you,
I'll make you breakfast,

01:19:02.259 --> 01:19:03.739
I'll do whatever
you need me to do.

01:19:04.522 --> 01:19:06.567
- All right?
- All right.

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:09.832
- Thanks, John.
- No worries, my man.

01:19:10.963 --> 01:19:12.182
I'm going to lock
this shit.

01:20:02.362 --> 01:20:03.799
You look sleepy!

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.671
What, you just woke up?

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.458
You wanna say hello
to Cosmo, huh?

01:20:12.372 --> 01:20:13.243
Oh!

01:20:14.374 --> 01:20:15.854
Don't worry about it, man.
I got it.

01:20:17.856 --> 01:20:19.075
I gotta...
I'm going to go,

01:20:19.336 --> 01:20:20.511
I'm going to say goodbye
to my friends, okay?

01:20:21.077 --> 01:20:22.469
I'm going to say goodbye
to my friends

01:20:22.643 --> 01:20:23.731
and then I'm gonna
call you back, all right?

01:20:23.906 --> 01:20:25.168
Hey, Cosmo, come here!

01:20:25.385 --> 01:20:26.734
Okay, Cosmo, come here, boy!

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:28.171
Come here!

01:20:28.345 --> 01:20:29.868
Now, tell Mom to answer
the phone, okay?

01:20:30.129 --> 01:20:33.916
Please, yes, yes, okay,
I love you more than ketchup.

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:37.397
Charles, please, sit down.
Take your backpack off.

01:20:37.571 --> 01:20:38.964
- Please, come on.
- Don't have time,

01:20:39.138 --> 01:20:40.357
- Roddy, don't have time.
- Eli!

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:41.837
Take some time.

01:20:42.011 --> 01:20:43.316
- Can I sit down?
- Please sit down.

01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:44.927
Eat.
You need food.

01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:46.580
- I need food?
- You.

01:20:46.754 --> 01:20:48.017
- Move, Cosmo.
- So what's the deal?

01:20:48.191 --> 01:20:50.280
You gotta return the car
or some shit?

01:20:50.454 --> 01:20:52.760
- We gotta get outta here, man.
- Move that butt. Move that butt, dog.

01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:55.502
Where'd you rent it from
this time?

01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:00.420
Oh, come on!
I was Instagramming that, man.

01:21:00.594 --> 01:21:02.466
I know,
but we got to go.

01:21:02.727 --> 01:21:04.163
But if I didn't
Instagram it,

01:21:04.337 --> 01:21:05.599
then the whole weekend
never happened, right?

01:21:06.165 --> 01:21:07.863
Hey!
What's up with the hot water?

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.169
- We're out!
- What's this?

01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:12.780
I'm never coming back!

01:21:27.665 --> 01:21:30.450
- Gonna recycle it.
- Oh, yeah. Compost, compost.

01:21:30.668 --> 01:21:31.930
- I like it.
- Yo!

01:21:32.104 --> 01:21:33.410
- Yo, yo!
- Oh, shit!

01:21:33.584 --> 01:21:34.846
How you feelin'?

01:21:35.281 --> 01:21:36.674
- Pretty shit.
- Yeah.

01:21:37.022 --> 01:21:40.069
Do you wanna hair of the dog,
or beer or anything?

01:21:40.243 --> 01:21:41.244
Just to balance you out?

01:21:41.418 --> 01:21:43.072
No, no, man, I need...

01:21:43.289 --> 01:21:44.987
Like,
you got an Advil, or?

01:21:45.161 --> 01:21:46.379
I'm sure Nico has...

01:21:46.684 --> 01:21:47.859
Yeah, he's got something
in the house, for sure.

01:21:48.381 --> 01:21:50.296
- Just ask him, it'll be cool.
- All right, yo.

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:52.037
- How'd you sleep?
- Good.

01:21:52.211 --> 01:21:54.170
- Good. Can't complain.
- How you feeling this morning?

01:21:54.344 --> 01:21:56.085
I'm good.
Thank you.

01:21:56.259 --> 01:21:58.174
I told y'all, do the other half,
you don't have to do that now.

01:21:58.348 --> 01:21:59.610
Nico, you got any, like...

01:21:59.784 --> 01:22:02.047
headache medicine,
like Advil, Aleve?

01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:03.962
I don't know, man.
Let me check.

01:22:04.136 --> 01:22:05.659
All right. Thank you.

01:22:07.705 --> 01:22:10.055
- Hey, Nico, where's...
- It smells amazing!

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.628
We got it, don't worry,
we'll talk care of it.

01:22:17.802 --> 01:22:19.151
You did enough, Nico.

01:22:19.325 --> 01:22:20.761
Just don't let it go down
your throat.

01:22:21.371 --> 01:22:22.633
Where's my fur, bitch?

01:22:23.155 --> 01:22:25.114
I like you in that do-rag, man.

01:22:25.418 --> 01:22:27.203
I used to have one of those
things, you know?

01:22:27.377 --> 01:22:28.639
In high school?

01:22:28.813 --> 01:22:30.293
This kid Justin in my class
had one,

01:22:30.467 --> 01:22:31.859
I was like "I'll give you
20 bucks right now,

01:22:32.034 --> 01:22:33.600
I want that." I wore that thing
for like a year,

01:22:33.774 --> 01:22:35.124
I miss it, man.
You can have this one

01:22:35.298 --> 01:22:36.299
for 20 bucks!

01:22:36.473 --> 01:22:37.561
- Yeah.
- Give me that shit.

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:39.824
- For real.
- I'll keep that

01:22:39.998 --> 01:22:41.304
- and you'll keep the fur.
- Yeah!

01:22:41.478 --> 01:22:42.870
Yeah, I'm down for that.

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.307
Okay, one of us is getting
a good deal here.

01:22:44.524 --> 01:22:45.569
You're just selling shit?

01:22:45.743 --> 01:22:46.700
- All right!
- Fuck it!

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:50.356
Hey, Tyler, if you want
this back, for real,

01:22:51.183 --> 01:22:53.185
we gotta meet up
in the city.

01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:55.187
- For sure
- I'm kidnapping it until then.

01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:57.276
- Okay.
- Or you just buy another one.

01:22:57.668 --> 01:22:59.191
Yo.
Time out.

01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:00.976
Has anyone seen this,
by the way?

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:03.239
Does anyone think this is
normal, is it appropriate?

01:23:03.413 --> 01:23:05.937
Look at him.
Look at that.

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:07.808
I'm gonna call you
Kinder Bueno.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.158
- So, growing up in eight-Mile...
- Kinder Bueno?

01:23:09.332 --> 01:23:11.029
...did you know
Marshall Mathers or...

01:23:11.203 --> 01:23:12.857
All right, all right,
I love you beautiful fuckers,

01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.337
- but it is time to go.
- You guys going?

01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:16.034
- You guys leaving now?
- Yeah, we gotta go.

01:23:16.208 --> 01:23:18.080
We need to get one picture,
one picture!

01:23:18.254 --> 01:23:20.212
Hey, Ty,
give that to Nico.

01:23:20.386 --> 01:23:21.561
Nico,
take the picture, baby.

01:23:21.822 --> 01:23:23.433
No, no, no, Nico,
get in, get in.

01:23:23.607 --> 01:23:25.087
- I'll take it.
- No, no, no, Tyler,

01:23:25.261 --> 01:23:26.697
fuck you,
you get in the picture!

01:23:26.871 --> 01:23:29.482
- Come on, guys, get in.
- Yeah, fuck you!

01:23:29.656 --> 01:23:31.571
Turn this shit around
and hold it up.

01:23:31.745 --> 01:23:33.095
- All right. Let's go.
- Get your face in this shit!

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:36.402
Shit, are you
getting the picture?

01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:37.751
Make room, make room!

01:23:37.925 --> 01:23:38.926
I got a dog.
