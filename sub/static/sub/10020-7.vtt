00:03.948 --> 00:06.326
ER

00:06.327 --> 00:08.135
Previously on ER...

00:08.170 --> 00:09.618
Ah, my dad died.

00:09.619 --> 00:11.613
What? What happend?

00:11.614 --> 00:14.897
It was a car wreck or something.
They weren't clear on the details.

00:16.061 --> 00:21.054
But I gotta go claim the body
and... stuff like that. So...

00:21.482 --> 00:22.989
I'm sorry.

00:53.851 --> 00:55.431
How much farther?

00:55.648 --> 00:57.644
About 20 minutes or so.

00:57.862 --> 00:59.062
A subcompact?

00:59.283 --> 01:00.696
That's all they had.

01:01.581 --> 01:06.548
- What is it? 110 degrees out here?
- They didn't have a midsize.

01:06.887 --> 01:08.682
The air conditioning doesn't work.

01:08.893 --> 01:10.889
It's November. Who asks?

01:13.029 --> 01:15.322
Next time you get the luggage.
I'll get the car.

01:15.536 --> 01:16.617
All right.

01:19.547 --> 01:22.423
- How much longer?
- About 30 seconds since you last asked.

01:22.639 --> 01:24.850
You always this tough to travel with?

01:25.063 --> 01:26.096
My knees are-

01:26.274 --> 01:29.780
Seventeen miles. We got
17 miles till we get there.

01:31.330 --> 01:33.576
Every summer, no matter
where we were...

01:33.795 --> 01:38.715
...we'd have to pile in the car and go
see some godforsaken national park.

01:38.934 --> 01:41.976
Or go see some distant relative
someplace.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.332
Weeks on end. I hated it.
Every minute, I hated it.

01:52.347 --> 01:54.557
Seventeen miles?
Is that what you said?

01:54.770 --> 01:56.850
Sixteen and a half.

02:09.645 --> 02:10.678
Doug.

02:13.071 --> 02:14.152
Thanks.

02:14.408 --> 02:18.282
The highway patrol is down the road
to the left. We can't miss it.

02:19.297 --> 02:20.579
What was your dad doing here?

02:20.801 --> 02:23.296
He was probably
heading up to Tahoe or Vegas.

02:23.517 --> 02:26.148
- He liked to gamble?
- Yeah, you might say that.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.691
- Got you a present.
- Thanks.

02:29.951 --> 02:32.599
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

02:34.631 --> 02:36.627
Listen, we don't have to do this.

02:37.430 --> 02:42.231
We could find some air conditioning,
get something to drink.

02:42.444 --> 02:43.727
We're in no hurry.

02:43.948 --> 02:45.909
Let's get this over with.

03:03.043 --> 03:05.253
When his name showed up
in the paper...

03:05.466 --> 03:08.639
...a woman called from Barstow.
He was renting a room there.

03:08.809 --> 03:11.483
- Found you in his address book.
- Barstow?

03:11.943 --> 03:13.570
He was in a motel.

03:14.408 --> 03:15.608
You weren't in touch?

03:15.828 --> 03:17.456
No. No, no.

03:19.464 --> 03:22.339
We got the stuff from the trunk
in the evidence locker.

03:22.555 --> 03:25.133
I couldn't tell what was his
and what was hers.

03:25.898 --> 03:27.015
Hers?

03:27.235 --> 03:28.863
Yeah. A Sherry Fox.

03:29.074 --> 03:31.319
We're having trouble locating
her next of kin.

03:31.539 --> 03:33.701
I was hoping you could help me
with that.

03:36.803 --> 03:37.836
Was she killed?

03:38.767 --> 03:41.976
Your father ran a stop sign
two nights ago, doing 120.

03:42.402 --> 03:44.149
Hit a pickup truck.

03:44.366 --> 03:47.076
Killed himself, Miss Fox,
the driver of the pickup...

03:47.249 --> 03:50.255
...a Pedro Lopez, father of six.

03:51.260 --> 03:56.180
Blood alcohol level was. 33.
Four times the legal limit.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.922
What a place to die.

05:02.263 --> 05:06.212
He never drove less than 70 miles
an hour his entire life.

05:07.059 --> 05:10.392
He used to think it was funny
to drive with his knees.

05:11.479 --> 05:15.179
With his eyes closed. He thought
it was some sort of game.

05:16.567 --> 05:20.646
Idiot. He can't even
kill himself right. He has to...

05:20.861 --> 05:22.403
...take other people with him.

05:23.363 --> 05:25.402
Leave me to clean up the mess.

05:26.116 --> 05:28.951
I don't think your dad planned
on dying out here.

05:29.118 --> 05:31.360
He never planned anything
his entire life.

05:31.578 --> 05:34.448
He never planned to lose our TV
in a poker game.

05:34.622 --> 05:38.619
He never planned to be gone for more
than a couple of days.

05:39.710 --> 05:43.457
He never planned to hurt anybody
in his whole life.

05:43.629 --> 05:46.120
Your dad lost your TV in
a poker game?

05:48.717 --> 05:51.172
I should've killed him myself.

05:51.386 --> 05:53.627
Saved everybody the trouble.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.181
He was paid up through Thanksgiving.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.760
So I figured I should leave everything
where it was until...

06:02.979 --> 06:05.350
...the rent ran out or somebody
showed up.

06:08.649 --> 06:10.807
Bathroom's in here.

06:12.570 --> 06:14.526
You're the doctor, aren't you?

06:15.822 --> 06:18.147
He talked about you all the time.

06:19.116 --> 06:21.323
So he wasn't here by himself?

06:21.535 --> 06:24.453
Oh, no, honey.
He had his wife with him.

06:25.205 --> 06:29.153
Y'all want to stay in here tonight?
I'll get some clean sheets and-

06:29.332 --> 06:32.368
No, thank you. But if you
have a couple extra rooms?

06:32.669 --> 06:35.040
- Adjoining?
- Fine.

06:35.797 --> 06:39.876
Such a nice couple.
Terrible, what happened.

06:42.427 --> 06:44.585
- Wife?
- I doubt it.

06:44.804 --> 06:45.965
Who's that?

06:46.680 --> 06:48.174
I have no idea.

06:48.765 --> 06:50.342
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

06:51.685 --> 06:53.677
Yeah. That's high school.

06:53.894 --> 06:55.637
Look at that hair. Played varsity?

06:55.854 --> 06:57.763
We went to state that year.

06:57.981 --> 07:01.100
I played JV. I wasn't very good.

07:02.943 --> 07:04.353
Oh, man.

07:06.070 --> 07:08.110
Your mom?

07:08.322 --> 07:09.520
Yeah.

07:14.368 --> 07:18.412
For a guy who didn't care, he sure had
a lot of photos of you guys around.

07:35.344 --> 07:38.379
You hungry? Want something to eat?
There's a taco stand.

07:38.596 --> 07:40.921
No, I'm not hungry.
You go ahead.

07:41.140 --> 07:45.054
I found this in the closet.
Home movies or something.

07:45.811 --> 07:49.393
I didn't find much to tell us
about the wife.

07:50.189 --> 07:52.560
Just some clothes, cosmetics...

07:54.401 --> 07:55.729
No letters or mail or anything.

07:56.236 --> 07:59.189
She was probably a hooker
or a cocktail waitress.

07:59.405 --> 08:02.987
- Any money in here?
- No. Just a couple of pawn tickets.

08:04.409 --> 08:06.696
Well, there it is.
There's my inheritance.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.863
Some women's clothes, a couple of
half-empty liquor bottles...

08:12.082 --> 08:15.082
...and two pawn tickets.
Sounds like my dad.

08:15.543 --> 08:17.251
Well, here you are.

08:19.421 --> 08:20.749
Thirteen.

08:20.922 --> 08:23.626
Fourteen. Oh, honey!

08:23.841 --> 08:27.090
Down on the corner, huh?
Away from the highway noise.

08:28.345 --> 08:30.918
Oh, I forgot to tell you earlier.

08:31.098 --> 08:33.385
Your daddy's car is parked
around back.

08:33.599 --> 08:35.258
He didn't wreck it?

08:35.476 --> 08:38.844
No. It must've been her car.
His car's still here.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.766
The son of a bitch.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.350
He kept it.

08:49.570 --> 08:54.196
He was always out here polishing it.
Said he'd had it for years.

08:54.907 --> 08:56.449
Since the '70s.

08:57.743 --> 08:59.486
It's a beauty!

09:02.539 --> 09:06.536
Maybe the keys are with your dad's
stuff. That envelope's in the car.

09:06.750 --> 09:10.617
Pull the garage door shut and lock it
when you're finished. All right?

09:10.795 --> 09:11.993
Yeah.

10:26.605 --> 10:29.689
- I learned to drive in this car.
- Yeah?

10:32.193 --> 10:34.731
My dad, we wouldn't see him
for months...

10:34.946 --> 10:37.022
...and then he'd just show up.
He'd just...

10:37.239 --> 10:41.070
...bring my mom a present, and he'd
bring me a signed football from...

10:41.284 --> 10:44.320
...Joe Namath, Bob Griese,
somebody like that.

10:44.537 --> 10:46.779
Then he'd gather me up...

10:46.997 --> 10:50.033
...and tell my mom we were going
to a ball game.

10:50.207 --> 10:54.537
And then we would just hit the road.
We'd disappear for days.

10:55.462 --> 11:00.373
We'd be driving to Vegas. Sometimes
we'd drive to Atlantic City.

11:03.510 --> 11:05.468
It was back before my mom remarried.

11:05.678 --> 11:08.134
So we were still living in
Kentucky at the time.

11:08.347 --> 11:12.723
I was maybe 13, 12, I think.

11:13.727 --> 11:17.558
We'd be in Oklahoma or Indiana,
middle of the night.

11:18.481 --> 11:21.481
My dad would wake me up and say,
"Okay, you're driving. "

11:23.067 --> 11:25.606
We'd get off on some side road...

11:26.238 --> 11:28.312
...and I'd slide in behind the wheel.

11:30.866 --> 11:33.238
Just floor it, you know?

11:33.617 --> 11:38.077
Just feel those 426 horses
and just...

11:40.040 --> 11:41.582
I just felt like...

11:42.417 --> 11:44.290
...I was flying.

11:45.877 --> 11:47.371
Sounds pretty great.

11:50.255 --> 11:51.999
He had his moments.

11:57.512 --> 11:59.587
- Gas?
- We got a quarter of a tank.

12:00.765 --> 12:02.092
What?

12:06.352 --> 12:07.598
Hang on a minute.

12:09.814 --> 12:10.975
Now what?

12:11.356 --> 12:14.559
My dad used to keep a gas can
in the trunk.

12:20.780 --> 12:24.195
You usually don't see that much baby
stuff all in one place.

12:30.539 --> 12:32.489
No gas.

13:05.020 --> 13:08.227
I'm doing fine. Looks like you
had a long night, though.

13:20.845 --> 13:22.390
Sure this is the right place?

13:22.600 --> 13:25.009
I don't know about that last left.

13:30.407 --> 13:31.441
Hello!

13:35.042 --> 13:36.243
Maybe everybody's working.

13:36.421 --> 13:39.175
Hello? Anybody here?

13:40.137 --> 13:41.336
Hey!

13:42.434 --> 13:45.058
Hey! How are you doing?

13:45.273 --> 13:48.147
- You're a Broncos fan, huh?
- Dallas.

13:48.363 --> 13:51.486
Dallas? I'm looking for
the Lopez family.

13:51.704 --> 13:53.913
Which one? We got two of them.

13:54.125 --> 13:57.962
Pedro Lopez. Died in a car accident.
We're trying to find his family.

13:59.303 --> 14:00.502
Not here.

14:00.723 --> 14:02.516
Not here as in he doesn't live here?

14:02.727 --> 14:05.303
Or not here like he's
not here right now?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.154
Who are you?

14:10.410 --> 14:12.987
I'm Doug. Listen, do me a favor.

14:13.167 --> 14:14.828
Will you stop that
for a second?

14:15.421 --> 14:16.453
Where are they?

14:16.674 --> 14:19.714
Everybody's at the funeral.
They're burying Mr. Lopez today.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.247
Saints of God, come to his aid.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.676
Hasten to meet him, angels of
the Lord.

14:43.315 --> 14:45.357
Eternal rest grant him, O Lord.

14:53.002 --> 14:57.918
To You, our Lord, we commend the soul
of Pedro, your servant.

14:58.180 --> 15:01.434
In the sight of this world
he is dead.

15:01.646 --> 15:04.436
In your sight, may he live forever.

15:04.610 --> 15:08.066
Forgive whatever sins he may have
committed through human weakness.

15:08.285 --> 15:11.289
And in your goodness,
grant him eternal life.

15:11.499 --> 15:13.958
We ask this through Christ our Lord.

15:14.131 --> 15:15.164
Amen.

15:16.177 --> 15:20.132
In peace, let us take our brother
to his place to rest.

15:25.656 --> 15:28.280
You want to say something
to the family?

15:28.495 --> 15:29.694
I don't know what I'd say.

15:29.914 --> 15:33.038
We could find a florist.
Send some flowers.

15:33.255 --> 15:35.666
Doug, it's not your fault.

15:35.886 --> 15:38.177
It's tragic, but it had nothing
to do with you.

15:38.391 --> 15:41.100
- You were thousands of miles away.
- I know...

15:41.314 --> 15:42.346
You know, I just...

15:42.525 --> 15:43.807
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

15:44.028 --> 15:45.940
Were you planning on joining us
for the internment?

15:46.158 --> 15:47.618
No. Thank you, Father.

15:47.828 --> 15:50.037
Did you know Pedro or the family?

15:50.209 --> 15:51.241
No.

15:51.461 --> 15:53.336
- I didn't think-
- My father was the drunk...

15:53.548 --> 15:56.388
...that ran the stop sign
and killed him.

15:58.726 --> 16:00.270
But you came.

16:01.608 --> 16:03.068
It doesn't change things.

16:04.405 --> 16:06.116
It shows that you loved your father.

16:11.087 --> 16:14.293
- I have to go now. Take care.
- Thank you.

16:16.473 --> 16:18.135
Come on.

16:20.106 --> 16:22.267
I always wanted a pocket watch.

16:22.653 --> 16:25.823
I don't know if I'd use it,
but I like the idea of it.

16:26.035 --> 16:28.660
An heirloom to pass on
from generation to generation.

16:28.875 --> 16:31.369
I don't think Rachel would be
excited about it.

16:31.589 --> 16:34.427
Well, not for Rachel.
But for a son it would be great.

16:34.637 --> 16:38.805
- Do you have something to tell me?
- I don't have a son, but...

16:39.022 --> 16:43.439
If I had my great-great-grandfather's
pocket watch, that would be cool.

16:43.657 --> 16:47.326
My family's only heirloom is my
grandfather's fraternity beer stein.

16:47.499 --> 16:50.455
This must be it. It's got
the right tag number.

16:50.629 --> 16:51.662
What is it?

16:51.883 --> 16:54.294
- It's a movie projector.
- Hope you didn't pay much.

16:54.514 --> 16:59.228
Ten bucks. I didn't even want it,
but I figured, what the hell?

16:59.441 --> 17:01.150
- How much is this?
- I'll be right back.

17:01.361 --> 17:03.903
- Which one?
- That one.

17:04.117 --> 17:05.992
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Shut up!

17:06.204 --> 17:08.366
- It's a real diamond?
- Sure, they're real.

17:08.544 --> 17:10.372
Which one you looking at?

17:10.548 --> 17:14.217
Let's see. That's 75 bucks.

17:15.308 --> 17:17.387
- "Cynthia"?
- Yeah. I think she'd like it.

17:17.605 --> 17:19.397
You buy that, you're walking back.

17:19.608 --> 17:21.651
Here we go. We got a Rolex.

17:21.864 --> 17:23.145
That's nice.

17:23.492 --> 17:26.164
My dad loved this. He'd brush
his teeth first...

17:26.373 --> 17:29.295
...and then use the toothbrush
to clean the watch at night.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.759
Pinky ring.

17:33.932 --> 17:35.842
That is a big one.

17:36.061 --> 17:37.890
Three and a half carats.

17:38.942 --> 17:42.779
He talked her into giving it up.
They kept their wedding rings.

17:42.993 --> 17:45.071
Wouldn't even think about
giving them up.

17:50.425 --> 17:53.929
Carol, it's Doug. I was hoping
to catch you before work.

17:54.142 --> 17:57.230
We're here in Barstow,
and still we're cleaning up.

17:57.481 --> 17:59.940
I was just thinking about you...

18:00.656 --> 18:02.199
...and wishing you were here.

18:02.952 --> 18:04.496
I just miss you.

18:05.332 --> 18:07.576
I just wish you were here, is all.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.837
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay, bye.

18:11.054 --> 18:12.334
- Hey!
- Who was that?

18:12.556 --> 18:15.264
Somebody I've been seeing
the last couple months.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.679
Sounds serious.

18:16.899 --> 18:18.478
You want any of these ties?

18:18.694 --> 18:21.105
I only wear ties at work.
Is it anybody I know?

18:21.325 --> 18:23.866
Got an Armani. I believe
it's double-breasted.

18:24.039 --> 18:25.285
You won't tell me who it is?

18:25.500 --> 18:27.791
He had a set of clubs somewhere.

18:28.005 --> 18:29.881
Why don't you want to tell me?

18:30.052 --> 18:31.928
Because I don't.

18:32.891 --> 18:35.647
- It's not my ex-wife, is it?
- No. It's not Jennifer.

18:35.857 --> 18:37.400
Cynthia? You're not, are you?

18:37.569 --> 18:39.028
No. And neither should you.

18:39.238 --> 18:40.901
Jeanie? Chuny? Anna?

18:41.117 --> 18:44.455
Are you planning on naming everybody
who works in the hospital?

18:44.667 --> 18:46.211
She doesn't work in the hospital?

18:46.421 --> 18:47.798
It's Carol.

18:48.006 --> 18:49.289
- What?
- Carol Hathaway.

18:50.721 --> 18:51.754
Your mouth's open.

18:53.853 --> 18:55.979
- I'm speechless.
- Well, I'm relieved.

18:56.192 --> 18:57.225
You're back together?

18:57.444 --> 19:00.234
She didn't want me talking about it.
She didn't want it out at work.

19:00.451 --> 19:03.124
All right. Now, you are sworn
to secrecy.

19:04.250 --> 19:07.624
She swore she'd never get back
together with you after last time.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.300
- Things change.
- Wow!

19:10.472 --> 19:12.717
You know, it's not that amazing.

19:12.937 --> 19:14.265
Wow!

19:14.606 --> 19:16.435
You can stop saying "Wow! "

19:16.819 --> 19:18.149
I can't believe it.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.123
- You've said that.
- I'm happy for you. That's great.

19:22.665 --> 19:24.327
Good. Thanks, buddy.

19:25.253 --> 19:28.842
It's just that after what happened
last time, I can't believe it.

19:29.055 --> 19:30.716
Yeah. Well, thanks.

19:32.227 --> 19:34.602
Does she make you take
a lie detector test every week?

19:34.816 --> 19:36.361
Have you tried the beer?
It's good!

19:36.528 --> 19:39.486
No! Hey, now that's not fair!

19:40.328 --> 19:41.574
Son of a bitch!

19:46.717 --> 19:48.712
- Give me that!
- Mother of God!

19:49.724 --> 19:51.267
Get off me!

19:53.983 --> 19:55.228
Any more beer?

19:55.443 --> 19:57.902
You can squeeze something
out of the drapes.

19:58.075 --> 20:00.747
Smells like a brewery in here.

20:01.457 --> 20:05.246
Are you finding out anything about
the mystery stepmom in there?

20:05.423 --> 20:08.345
She had a nice body
and wore kinky lingerie.

20:08.556 --> 20:10.182
Lucky dad.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.515
Spent a lot of time in Laughlin,
Flagstaff and Vegas.

20:14.736 --> 20:16.279
My dad collected these matchbooks.

20:16.489 --> 20:19.578
That's how we'd keep account of him.
Matchbooks.

20:19.747 --> 20:20.779
Look at this.

20:22.461 --> 20:24.420
I think that's her. Look at the ring.

20:24.883 --> 20:25.915
Yeah.

20:26.135 --> 20:29.389
I found this at the bottom of
her suitcase.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.558
A Christmas card with
a return address to Long Beach.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.519
Now look at this.

20:36.241 --> 20:37.522
She had a baby.

20:37.743 --> 20:39.489
Almost every photo,
it's her, the baby...

20:39.706 --> 20:41.700
...and look, there's my dad.

20:42.462 --> 20:44.373
Think the baby was his?

20:45.844 --> 20:48.420
I don't know. Maybe.

20:49.853 --> 20:52.477
That'd be kind of weird, huh?

20:53.527 --> 20:55.237
Where do you think the baby is now?

20:55.448 --> 20:59.451
I don't know.
Maybe grandparents, friends.

20:59.665 --> 21:04.249
In a bassinet outside a convent.
Knowing my dad it could be...

21:08.935 --> 21:11.096
The hard part is that...

21:14.447 --> 21:17.785
...there was this power that
he held over us.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.624
I would be so happy when he
would come home.

21:22.839 --> 21:25.298
And I would tell myself
that I wouldn't be.

21:25.512 --> 21:28.600
Then he'd come home and tell
a story, give you a present.

21:28.811 --> 21:31.935
We would all be sitting there
like we were some kind of...

21:32.110 --> 21:33.820
...a normal family.

21:40.629 --> 21:42.125
I just never...

21:42.633 --> 21:43.879
...told him.

21:45.305 --> 21:49.307
I just figured that there would be
a right time.

21:49.773 --> 21:52.564
Son of a bitch even got
control of that.

21:57.331 --> 21:58.496
Want to watch this?

22:00.337 --> 22:02.666
- What? What's that?
- The home movies.

22:03.094 --> 22:04.125
- Come on.
- No!

22:04.345 --> 22:06.721
My chance to see you in diapers.

22:08.606 --> 22:10.232
Again?

22:12.865 --> 22:15.702
You know, my dad and I,
we barely even speak.

22:16.413 --> 22:19.667
If I call the house
and he picks up the phone...

22:19.879 --> 22:22.421
...he just says, "Hang on.
Let me get your mother. "

22:23.847 --> 22:27.266
He put in 30 years, and for what?

22:28.064 --> 22:32.066
He still retired as a captain.
He just kept getting passed over.

22:33.033 --> 22:37.581
I mean, he did every crappy assignment
that the Navy wanted him to do.

22:37.751 --> 22:39.378
And it didn't matter.

22:39.589 --> 22:41.963
- He never got the nod.
- Why not?

22:43.388 --> 22:44.933
Probably...

22:45.809 --> 22:48.601
...because of his winning personality.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.620
All right.

22:58.170 --> 23:01.674
Now all we need is popcorn.

23:05.311 --> 23:07.602
- You ready?
- No!

23:09.027 --> 23:11.734
You hit this and you hit that.

23:13.662 --> 23:15.075
Is that you?

23:15.249 --> 23:16.280
Yep.

23:43.226 --> 23:44.638
Your mom.

23:48.779 --> 23:50.240
Yeah.

24:01.181 --> 24:05.433
"1877. Alma Rodriguez Ruiz.

24:05.649 --> 24:10.566
1846 to 1849. "
She was only 3 years old.

24:12.915 --> 24:14.660
What are you thinking about, Doug?

24:16.881 --> 24:18.127
Carol.

24:21.307 --> 24:22.851
I'm in love with her.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.359
I used to think I knew what love was.

24:28.531 --> 24:32.700
I cared about women. I just don't
think I've ever really been in love.

24:34.920 --> 24:38.838
I think about her all the time.
I don't like it when I'm not with her.

24:39.053 --> 24:42.391
I don't want to be with anybody else.
That's love, isn't it?

24:42.562 --> 24:45.055
Yeah. That's love.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.517
Yeah.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.533
It'll be hot today, huh?

24:50.745 --> 24:52.290
It's November. Can you believe it?

24:52.500 --> 24:55.171
That's what I liked about living
in California.

24:55.673 --> 24:56.706
You lived here?

24:56.926 --> 24:59.597
San Diego. My parents
still live there.

25:00.851 --> 25:02.097
In San Diego?

25:02.270 --> 25:05.274
Yeah. A lot of retired Navy
down there.

25:05.444 --> 25:08.781
It's four hours from here.
We could be there at lunchtime.

25:08.951 --> 25:10.447
No, thanks.

25:10.789 --> 25:13.912
- When's the last time you saw them?
-18 months.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.083
Eighteen months? Okay, we're going.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.592
No, no. We got to see
that funeral director.

25:18.806 --> 25:20.218
That can wait.

25:20.434 --> 25:22.097
I made an appointment for today.

25:22.314 --> 25:25.816
My dad's not going anyplace, Mark.
Come on.

25:27.783 --> 25:29.779
- Nice!
- Let's go to the movies instead.

25:29.997 --> 25:31.907
We'll be in and out in a couple hours.

25:32.126 --> 25:35.416
Are you kidding? There's no such
thing as a quick visit with my mom.

25:35.634 --> 25:38.342
She's gonna insist that we
stay for dinner.

25:38.557 --> 25:40.635
- Probably something fried.
- Sounds great.

25:40.853 --> 25:44.607
Don't drink her ice tea. You'll
risk lapsing into insulin shock.

25:44.821 --> 25:47.231
- I like sugar in my tea.
- Want to get on her good side?

25:47.451 --> 25:49.530
- Admire her Hummels.
- Hummels?

25:49.706 --> 25:51.415
Believe me, you'll know what it is.

25:53.756 --> 25:56.048
Still have time for a clean getaway.

25:56.554 --> 25:58.180
That's Jake. He doesn't bite.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.517
- Hey, Jake.
- Hush, Jake! Quiet!

26:01.064 --> 26:03.023
Oh, my God!

26:04.487 --> 26:05.818
What are you doing here?

26:06.033 --> 26:09.072
- We were just in the neighborhood.
- You were not!

26:09.248 --> 26:10.448
- Come on in.
- Hi.

26:10.668 --> 26:11.747
My friend Doug Ross.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.915
- Hello, Doug.
- How are you doing?

26:14.091 --> 26:15.422
I got it. Jake, come in.

26:15.596 --> 26:18.433
Oh, my God! Look at you.
You're so skinny.

26:18.601 --> 26:20.181
I'm running again every day.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.898
- What are you doing here?
- Well, Doug-

26:23.110 --> 26:25.272
Why didn't you tell us
you were coming?

26:25.449 --> 26:29.404
Doug's father passed away suddenly,
and so I came out with him.

26:30.460 --> 26:33.833
- You poor thing. I'm so sorry.
- Well, thank you.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.094
Well, sit. Sit.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.763
I was just going through the mail.
All these catalogs.

26:39.981 --> 26:43.649
I always promise myself that I'm
not gonna look at them, but I do.

26:43.863 --> 26:46.654
You get on these lists
and you just can't get off.

26:48.791 --> 26:50.335
You two must be thirsty.

26:50.503 --> 26:53.043
Can I get you a drink?
I was having iced tea.

26:53.258 --> 26:55.337
- Water for me, Mom.
- I'd love iced tea.

26:55.514 --> 26:58.054
- When did you get in?
- Yesterday.

26:58.269 --> 26:59.682
- Yesterday?
- I'm gonna go.

26:59.856 --> 27:02.017
- And you didn't call?
- You stay here.

27:02.237 --> 27:03.352
Where you staying?

27:03.531 --> 27:06.072
- Barstow. In a motel.
- Is this a Hummel?

27:06.370 --> 27:09.660
Not tonight you' re not.
You' re gonna stay right here.

27:10.546 --> 27:14.334
Thanks, that sounds great,
if we' re not putting you out at all.

27:14.555 --> 27:16.514
Oh, absolutely.

27:16.726 --> 27:19.564
We have two guest rooms
and never any guests.

27:20.943 --> 27:24.281
Too much sugar? Mark kids me
about adding too much sugar.

27:24.493 --> 27:26.037
No. It's perfect.

27:27.457 --> 27:29.251
Oh, honey!

27:29.503 --> 27:31.546
How is my lovely Rachel?

27:31.758 --> 27:33.968
She's wonderful. And she misses you.

27:34.263 --> 27:38.183
You're a good liar. I bet she
barely remembers me.

27:38.398 --> 27:41.901
My son always says that they'll visit.
But I know...

27:42.114 --> 27:44.524
...that if I want to see my
only granddaughter...

27:44.744 --> 27:47.619
...I've gotta get on a plane
and go to Chicago.

27:47.835 --> 27:49.497
What's with the oxygen, Mom?

27:52.804 --> 27:56.307
It's your father.
He's still smoking, you know?

27:56.478 --> 27:58.889
Doctor says he's gotta stop,
but he just won't.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.437
Maybe you can talk some
sense into him.

28:01.656 --> 28:04.329
You know the military.
Everybody smokes.

28:04.537 --> 28:07.161
They used to give cigarettes
out in C rations.

28:07.962 --> 28:09.338
Is it emphysema, Mom?

28:10.008 --> 28:12.846
Yeah. Well, the doctor
says something like that.

28:13.014 --> 28:15.887
But it hasn't
slowed him down an inch.

28:16.103 --> 28:18.264
Let me get another one.
This is too sweet.

28:18.484 --> 28:20.478
I'm gonna run some errands.
I'll be back.

28:20.696 --> 28:21.777
You're leaving already?

28:21.950 --> 28:25.323
Yes. I'll be back for dinner if
the offer still stands?

28:25.665 --> 28:26.866
- Of course.
- You're going?

28:27.044 --> 28:30.714
Yes. Thank you for the iced tea.
And the Hummels are beautiful.

28:31.136 --> 28:33.096
- Oh, thanks!
- Beautiful.

28:33.308 --> 28:34.423
Okay, bye.

28:35.354 --> 28:36.897
He's a lovely boy.

28:39.237 --> 28:40.568
Where's Dad?

28:53.267 --> 28:54.467
Dad?

28:56.274 --> 28:57.935
Hello, Dad!

29:02.620 --> 29:04.080
Mark.

29:14.270 --> 29:15.980
What the hell are you doing here?

29:16.944 --> 29:18.938
Came by with a friend.

29:21.244 --> 29:22.277
You look good.

29:22.872 --> 29:24.154
Thank you.

29:26.339 --> 29:28.666
- House looks great.
- Yeah.

29:29.678 --> 29:31.341
Keeps me busy.

29:32.768 --> 29:34.763
I repainted the trim
a couple days ago.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.478
Looks nice.

29:38.656 --> 29:40.236
There's no wind.

29:42.164 --> 29:43.243
What?

29:43.458 --> 29:46.249
You're cupping your hand.
There's no wind.

29:47.342 --> 29:49.336
Too many years on deck.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.634
Hard habit to break.

29:55.108 --> 29:56.439
You should quit smoking.

29:57.154 --> 29:59.648
That's another hard habit to break.

30:01.163 --> 30:02.873
- Emphysema?
- You've seen your mother-

30:03.084 --> 30:04.283
You're on oxygen?

30:04.503 --> 30:09.384
I need help living my life, Mark,
you'll be the first person I call.

30:18.868 --> 30:20.661
- Woodworking?
- Yeah.

30:20.872 --> 30:22.582
I needed a hobby.

30:22.793 --> 30:26.166
Tried gardening for a while,
but it was too slow, you know?

30:26.384 --> 30:30.932
Waiting around for things to grow.
So I decided to try furniture.

30:31.144 --> 30:34.647
- Nice work.
- Making a dining set for your mother.

30:35.445 --> 30:38.022
- For Christmas.
- I'm sure she'll like it.

30:47.972 --> 30:49.599
Rachel's great.

30:50.184 --> 30:52.311
She's gotten bigger.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.195
She's smarter than me.
Or at least she thinks she is.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.917
That's kids for you.

31:04.090 --> 31:05.716
Well...

31:06.887 --> 31:08.170
I better get back.

31:08.391 --> 31:09.721
Yeah, right.

31:52.652 --> 31:54.315
Dad doesn't look good.

31:54.490 --> 31:56.569
Well, we're all getting older.

31:56.788 --> 31:58.497
When was he diagnosed
with emphysema?

31:59.042 --> 32:00.241
Here, honey.

32:00.461 --> 32:02.254
Make yourself useful.

32:02.465 --> 32:05.506
He's gotta start taking better
care of himself, Mom.

32:05.848 --> 32:07.557
You know your father.

32:07.768 --> 32:09.847
How high is his blood pressure?

32:10.107 --> 32:11.734
He doesn't have high blood pressure.

32:11.945 --> 32:15.032
Mom, I saw the medications
in the bathroom.

32:15.243 --> 32:17.488
Those are my pills, Mr. Nosey.

32:17.708 --> 32:19.417
When did you get
high blood pressure?

32:19.628 --> 32:21.706
Last year. I'm fine now.

32:21.883 --> 32:25.754
130/90. I took it yesterday
at the commissary.

32:25.975 --> 32:27.304
At the base?

32:27.520 --> 32:29.810
Yeah. On one of those
little machines.

32:30.025 --> 32:32.234
I check it every time I go shopping.

32:32.405 --> 32:34.066
Do you have your potassium checked?

32:34.283 --> 32:35.400
I'm sure I do.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.583
It's very important, and it's
not something that you check...

32:38.793 --> 32:40.076
...at the base supermarket.

32:40.297 --> 32:42.292
I appreciate this, but
I have a doctor.

32:43.262 --> 32:46.599
Has your doctor talked to you about
controlling your salt intake?

32:47.145 --> 32:49.436
Your father won't eat bland food.

32:49.901 --> 32:53.606
Dad can live a lot longer without
salt than he can without you.

32:54.118 --> 32:55.662
Mark, we are both fine.

32:55.872 --> 32:58.711
I take my walks. I watch what I eat.

32:58.921 --> 33:01.794
Now, stop being a doctor
and finish shucking those peas.

33:02.386 --> 33:04.844
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- Not a word!

33:06.270 --> 33:09.108
I'm sorry your friend wasn't
back in time for dinner.

33:09.317 --> 33:12.655
I don't think he realized we'd be
eating in midafternoon.

33:12.867 --> 33:15.740
I'll put a plate in the fridge
for him.

33:17.961 --> 33:21.001
You remember the Orkins?
Bruce and Christina?

33:21.719 --> 33:23.180
They live here now.

33:23.348 --> 33:26.388
They had two boys about your age
when we were in Pensacola.

33:26.605 --> 33:27.982
I don't think so.

33:28.192 --> 33:30.316
Bruce was in Intelligence, wasn't he?

33:31.532 --> 33:32.564
Communications.

33:35.708 --> 33:37.917
Their oldest boy, Carl,
is a flier now.

33:38.130 --> 33:40.838
A lieutenant commander,
stationed up at Whidbey.

33:42.723 --> 33:44.552
Has three little girls of his own.

33:44.769 --> 33:47.097
Well, say hello to him for me.

33:50.364 --> 33:52.193
You two busy tonight?

33:52.411 --> 33:54.489
I was thinking we'd go buy
some ice cream.

33:54.708 --> 33:57.247
That place on Mission Bay,
is it still there?

33:57.755 --> 34:00.047
I don't know. I haven't been
there in years.

34:00.261 --> 34:02.469
I have to go to the club tonight.

34:04.018 --> 34:07.272
- You could go tomorrow night.
- I'm meeting Frank and Harry.

34:07.442 --> 34:09.103
You can call them.

34:10.408 --> 34:12.782
It's Thursday.
We always meet on Thursdays.

34:12.996 --> 34:16.083
Well, this week you'll meet on Friday.

34:16.295 --> 34:18.504
It's no big deal.
We'll do it another time.

34:18.717 --> 34:19.750
You two go.

34:20.972 --> 34:22.800
Have a good time.

34:22.976 --> 34:24.804
You go to the club with your dad.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.518
Mark wouldn't be comfortable.

34:26.734 --> 34:30.154
You should spend time together.
You'd really enjoy it.

34:31.453 --> 34:33.329
- You need the inhaler?
- I'm fine.

34:33.498 --> 34:35.708
- Albuterol? I know where it is.
- I'll get it.

34:36.172 --> 34:38.130
No!

34:45.817 --> 34:48.190
He doesn't like to be helped.
You know that.

34:56.465 --> 34:58.674
He'll be all right in a few minutes.

34:59.888 --> 35:02.976
I'll make him some hot tea.
It makes him feel better.

35:24.567 --> 35:28.699
The blaze near Lake Hodges destroyed
two homes and 1200 acres.

35:28.909 --> 35:33.459
It is completely out tonight, but
firefighters are still on the lines.

35:34.421 --> 35:38.507
Fire officials say they want new
homes built without wood roofs...

35:38.722 --> 35:41.643
...and without landscaping
within 100 feet.

35:41.854 --> 35:45.358
Arson investigators hope
a $ 10,000 reward leads them to...

35:45.570 --> 35:48.243
I'm quitting tonight.
I promise.

35:48.452 --> 35:49.781
Good.

35:49.997 --> 35:51.659
You used to smoke.

35:52.710 --> 35:53.911
Yes.

35:54.756 --> 35:57.714
Until someone I know hounded me
into giving it up.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.516
You were what? Seven or eight?

36:00.728 --> 36:03.852
We were living down in
Kings Bay, in Georgia.

36:04.736 --> 36:09.404
Every time I'd come home with a pack,
you'd flush it down the toilet.

36:09.622 --> 36:11.415
I was doing you a favor.

36:11.584 --> 36:14.043
You were ruthless.
You wouldn't even lie to me.

36:14.257 --> 36:17.012
You'd just march right in
and tell me you'd done it.

36:17.222 --> 36:19.597
I could've killed you!

36:23.276 --> 36:26.400
He's asleep in there,
in front of the TV.

36:26.617 --> 36:29.407
You'd better wake him if he's
gonna make his club.

36:30.834 --> 36:32.116
Well...

36:33.507 --> 36:36.546
...he only makes it about
half the time anymore anyway.

36:36.763 --> 36:39.008
His friends are worse.

36:39.227 --> 36:44.144
Usually he goes down there and he's
back home in less than an hour...

36:44.322 --> 36:46.649
...because nobody he knows shows up.

36:47.662 --> 36:50.417
You still like living near the base?

36:50.627 --> 36:52.087
It's convenient.

36:54.093 --> 36:58.225
All our friends live nearby.
Your father's got the club.

36:59.562 --> 37:01.357
It's a nice life.

37:02.694 --> 37:05.105
I know you never liked it,
but we do.

37:10.712 --> 37:13.918
He misses you. He'd never say so,
but he does.

37:14.721 --> 37:17.678
He'd like to see you more often.
You and Rachel.

37:17.893 --> 37:19.390
I love you, Mom.

37:19.648 --> 37:22.735
And I know you feel like you
have to defend him.

37:22.946 --> 37:26.201
But Dad doesn't think about
me or Rachel.

37:29.376 --> 37:32.381
Your father loves you very much, Mark.

37:33.678 --> 37:37.727
He may not show it in the way
that you want him to, but he does.

37:37.937 --> 37:40.265
I've never seen him show it at all.

37:40.693 --> 37:43.946
He's just not built that way.
You have to work harder with him.

37:44.117 --> 37:45.198
- I have to work harder?
- Yes.

37:45.412 --> 37:48.451
Of course, Mom.
Dad doesn't have to do anything.

37:51.592 --> 37:54.346
You've got some wonderful traits, Mark.

37:54.556 --> 37:58.012
But you always assume that you
know more about everybody...

37:58.230 --> 38:00.725
...and everything than you
actually do.

38:10.048 --> 38:13.088
I've got vanilla ice cream
and some fresh strawberries...

38:13.305 --> 38:15.134
...if you still feel like dessert.

38:22.449 --> 38:23.566
Hey!

38:24.537 --> 38:26.164
You missed dinner.

38:26.375 --> 38:29.248
Drove up to Long Beach.
Checked out that return address.

38:29.422 --> 38:30.455
Anything?

38:30.675 --> 38:33.550
Yeah. It's not my dad's kid.

38:33.766 --> 38:37.019
He's living in Arizona with
the ex-husband.

38:39.236 --> 38:41.729
How's family life?

38:41.950 --> 38:44.622
My dad's got emphysema.

38:44.831 --> 38:48.964
I thought he was gonna cough himself
to death over the fried chicken.

38:49.174 --> 38:50.419
Is he okay?

38:51.094 --> 38:53.850
He's on an inhaler, oxygen.
He seemed all right.

38:54.060 --> 38:57.764
- Is he getting decent care?
- I'm sure it's fine.

39:00.782 --> 39:03.276
So why don't you stay here
for a while?

39:03.455 --> 39:06.957
I'll go back up to Barstow,
and you spend some time with him.

39:09.676 --> 39:11.171
Why bother?

39:13.726 --> 39:18.477
You didn't miss much, not having your
father around when you were growing up.

39:18.653 --> 39:20.114
Believe me.

39:23.957 --> 39:27.411
That's kind of a crappy thing
to say, isn't it?

39:28.508 --> 39:30.420
It wasn't my idea to come down here.

39:30.638 --> 39:31.967
Don't stay.

39:32.182 --> 39:33.845
Don't worry. I won't.

39:34.270 --> 39:37.643
I'm confused. Your father's still
alive? Still with your mother?

39:38.363 --> 39:41.402
So that's the criteria for a good
father? Longevity?

39:41.619 --> 39:44.196
Did he smack you around?
Did he smack your mom around?

39:44.376 --> 39:46.584
- Poor Doug.
- Wait. "Poor Doug"?

39:46.755 --> 39:50.544
Did your father
throw up on your bed and pass out?

39:50.806 --> 39:53.727
Did he leave you in
a hallway in Atlantic City...

39:53.980 --> 39:56.853
...while he screwed some hatcheck
girl? Did he do that?

39:57.069 --> 39:59.065
Did he do that, Mark?!

40:01.912 --> 40:05.916
Your father was there for you
every night, and that's love.

40:06.173 --> 40:08.132
Whether it's the way you
want it or not...

40:08.344 --> 40:10.423
...it's love, Mark!

40:10.724 --> 40:15.226
You grew up in Ozzie and Harriet
land. Get your head out of your ass!

40:46.969 --> 40:48.844
I wrote Carol a note this afternoon.

40:49.474 --> 40:53.523
It's a card that reminded me of her.
Will you give it to her for me?

40:54.443 --> 40:56.236
You' re not going back with me?

40:56.447 --> 41:00.034
No. That woman in Long Beach gave me
an address in Flagstaff.

41:00.247 --> 41:03.371
I think I'm gonna head over there...

41:03.547 --> 41:07.049
...look up my dad's wife's relatives
and let them know what happened.

41:07.262 --> 41:08.758
And the kid.

41:12.064 --> 41:13.560
We should've stayed the night.

41:16.866 --> 41:19.242
It wasn't right to leave
the way we did.

41:20.624 --> 41:23.165
I had no right to just
lose it like that.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.496
No.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.045
You were right about me.

41:29.268 --> 41:33.852
I have been acting like a victim,
feeling sorry for myself.

41:34.529 --> 41:38.614
Self-pity isn't one of my more
attractive personality traits.

41:38.830 --> 41:42.417
Don't sell yourself short.
You're very good at it.

41:46.220 --> 41:48.679
I've spent my whole life
holding my breath...

41:48.893 --> 41:53.227
...afraid that something was gonna
spin out of control.

41:54.655 --> 41:58.658
I think that's why I got into medicine.
I wanted to have power over chaos.

42:02.004 --> 42:05.877
I was always terrified that something
awful was gonna happen.

42:06.890 --> 42:09.645
And then last spring, it did.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.736
I don't know who I am, Doug.

42:17.204 --> 42:20.708
That person who I was
died in that bathroom.

42:23.175 --> 42:26.097
And I don't know what's gonna
take his place.

42:58.125 --> 42:59.919
I'm beat!

43:04.472 --> 43:07.892
You want to grab some breakfast?
Maybe a few hours of sleep...

43:08.105 --> 43:10.397
...before we have to go
to that funeral home?

43:13.073 --> 43:14.784
Doug, you want to do that?

43:47.231 --> 43:48.561
This is it.

43:49.110 --> 43:52.150
Good. I don't want to climb
any more damn hills.

43:52.367 --> 43:54.278
Doug, it's beautiful!

43:58.004 --> 43:59.547
Want to say something?

44:00.300 --> 44:01.761
A prayer?

44:03.224 --> 44:04.553
No.

44:10.781 --> 44:12.861
I hated the son of a bitch...

44:14.373 --> 44:15.952
...and I loved him.

44:25.814 --> 44:27.476
Never simple, is it?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
