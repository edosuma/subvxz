00:29.212 --> 00:33.686
Boop.
That's right, Gunther.

00:33.763 --> 00:35.432
Keep it up.

00:38.444 --> 00:40.603
Oh-ho-ho, Gunther,

00:40.680 --> 00:42.789
just you wait...

00:43.330 --> 00:44.573
All right.

00:44.650 --> 00:47.301
Here we... Go.

00:50.726 --> 00:52.664
That's a good-lookin' lamp.

00:54.790 --> 00:56.556
Gunther, no!

00:58.322 --> 00:59.327
Huh?

01:11.622 --> 01:13.428
Just a sec!

01:13.698 --> 01:15.676
Here I come.

01:16.718 --> 01:18.553
Life giving Magus!

01:18.630 --> 01:20.829
I got your telegraph
inviting me to come over

01:20.906 --> 01:23.936
and share some wizz
blizzes, best bro style!

01:24.013 --> 01:26.384
I brought tiny umbrellas!

01:26.461 --> 01:28.990
I was kind of surprised
you invited me over.

01:29.067 --> 01:31.293
I thought Abracadaniel
was your best friend.

01:31.370 --> 01:33.440
Pfft!
Oh, I'm done with that guy.

01:33.517 --> 01:35.280
He kept trying to analyze me!

01:35.357 --> 01:37.942
Come on! Let me give you the nickel tour.

01:38.457 --> 01:40.468
These are my tubs 'n' skins.

01:40.545 --> 01:42.351
The "no flab" zone.

01:42.446 --> 01:44.077
Here's the office.

01:44.347 --> 01:45.397
Oh, hey!

01:45.474 --> 01:46.737
And remember when you touched
that book

01:46.814 --> 01:48.214
and, uh, brought it to life?

01:48.291 --> 01:50.631
- Yep.
- Ha ha!    - Aah!

01:50.708 --> 01:52.448
- This is his room.
- Get your pen out!

01:52.525 --> 01:54.291
Write in me!
Write in me!

01:54.368 --> 01:56.112
Fill my pages!

01:56.189 --> 01:57.328
Yeee.

01:57.543 --> 01:58.812
Mm?

01:59.410 --> 02:02.427
What is that wonderful smell?

02:02.739 --> 02:03.885
Oh. That?

02:03.962 --> 02:06.989
I'm baking my special pigs
in blankets...

02:07.066 --> 02:09.991
Right here in my darkened kitchen.

02:10.794 --> 02:13.568
Now, where is the dang ol' oven mitt?

02:13.645 --> 02:16.101
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.255
Oh, geez!

02:17.332 --> 02:18.849
Look who I'm talking to...

02:18.926 --> 02:20.921
Mr. Oven Mitts over here!

02:20.998 --> 02:23.138
Hey, here's a good idea.

02:23.215 --> 02:25.721
You should take off those mitts!

02:26.605 --> 02:27.733
Whoo!

02:28.987 --> 02:31.633
I don't want to accidentally
bring anything to life in a

02:31.710 --> 02:34.767
stranger's home...
With my magic hands.

02:34.859 --> 02:36.427
Come on, the pigs are burning!

02:36.504 --> 02:38.678
It's gonna wreck our Wizz Blizz hangout.

02:38.755 --> 02:40.279
Be a bro, bro.

02:40.347 --> 02:41.377
Mm...

02:41.454 --> 02:44.415
Well, if it's about being a bro...

02:46.382 --> 02:48.246
There we go, baby.

02:48.388 --> 02:51.348
Hey, I just remembered that
the oven light is burned out.

02:51.425 --> 02:55.783
Be a bro and turn on that lamp...
Right over there.

02:55.860 --> 02:58.579
You mean this one lamp in
the middle of the kitchen?

02:58.656 --> 02:59.771
Correct.

02:59.848 --> 03:01.139
Okay.

03:02.202 --> 03:04.499
Yeah, touch it.

03:04.937 --> 03:06.310
Oh, whoops!

03:06.477 --> 03:09.025
I almost did the thing
I didn't want to do.

03:09.102 --> 03:10.412
Oh, fart hat!

03:10.489 --> 03:11.549
Hmm...

03:11.626 --> 03:14.357
Life giving Magus,
watch out behind you!

03:14.484 --> 03:15.811
Yaah!

03:15.946 --> 03:17.908
Oh, no! Accidental life!

03:17.985 --> 03:19.315
Huh?

03:20.102 --> 03:21.418
You used me!

03:21.495 --> 03:24.505
You don't want to drink Wizz Blizz at all!

03:24.582 --> 03:26.711
Yes, I did use you!

03:26.788 --> 03:28.081
But for what?

03:28.158 --> 03:30.469
What did I use you for?

03:33.209 --> 03:34.695
Oh, my lamp.

03:34.772 --> 03:37.757
My beautiful lamp of so many years!

03:37.834 --> 03:39.518
Speak to me...

03:39.595 --> 03:40.893
Hello?

03:41.031 --> 03:42.107
Hello...

03:42.184 --> 03:43.192
A lady?!

03:43.269 --> 03:44.737
Unexpected bonus!

03:44.814 --> 03:47.966
Well, one isn't purely defined
by their sex or gender.

03:48.043 --> 03:50.279
I have yet to find out who I really am.

03:50.356 --> 03:53.716
I have freedom, no longer bound
by the limits of my cord,

03:53.793 --> 03:57.673
freedom to shape my reality
and, in turn, be shaped by it.

03:58.754 --> 04:00.204
You talk funny.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.244
- Like a book.
- Oh, humor.

04:02.321 --> 04:05.046
Humor is the highest form
of intelligence.

04:05.123 --> 04:07.319
Well, hey,
here's something funny.

04:09.633 --> 04:11.182
It sounds like a butt!

04:11.259 --> 04:12.250
Hmm.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.151
Well, goodbye.

04:14.228 --> 04:17.257
I'm not sticking around to
be used and thrown away.

04:17.334 --> 04:21.370
Aw, Magus, I can never have enough friends.

04:21.447 --> 04:22.873
Really?

04:23.443 --> 04:25.112
Ha haaaa! Ha ha ha!

04:25.189 --> 04:27.208
More friends!

04:31.560 --> 04:35.731
I'm credible...
almost complete

04:38.017 --> 04:39.733
Yes. Yes!

04:39.921 --> 04:41.110
Finally.

04:41.187 --> 04:45.317
Gather 'round
and lavish me with affection!

04:45.847 --> 04:47.176
Hey, we're alive now.

04:47.253 --> 04:50.121
You're alive?
Whoa! Me too!

04:51.047 --> 04:52.189
What?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.249
Sure, we all feel alive now,

04:54.326 --> 04:55.559
but how do we know it's not all,

04:55.636 --> 04:56.827
you know, just an illusion?

04:56.904 --> 04:59.090
I mean, I can reach out and
touch you, but it's all just

04:59.167 --> 05:02.470
signals to the brain, easily
re-creatable with the right technology.

05:02.547 --> 05:04.156
You know what I mean?

05:16.205 --> 05:17.704
Are you okay?

05:17.781 --> 05:19.283
What's with these nerds?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.023
They aren't into my juice.

05:21.100 --> 05:25.543
Maybe they just don't have an
appreciation for your type of humor.

05:26.307 --> 05:29.230
Maybe you could try and learn
about what they're interested in.

05:29.307 --> 05:30.493
Read up a little...

05:30.570 --> 05:31.900
Uh-huh.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.303
Ugh. Reading makes
my brain all cloudy.

05:43.380 --> 05:47.010
I bet you'd have something
insightful to say about that, huh?

05:57.936 --> 05:59.993
Eh?

06:06.787 --> 06:09.209
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
but no. Listen.

06:09.944 --> 06:10.989
Watch this.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.871
Through the simple
act of creation...

06:13.948 --> 06:16.279
Have I become a reflection
of my own creator?

06:16.453 --> 06:18.146
If I may interject...

06:18.223 --> 06:22.174
Aristotle once said,
"nature abhors a vacuum."

06:22.251 --> 06:24.355
Then why do I love doing this so much?

06:28.239 --> 06:30.061
Seriously,
someone explain it to me.

06:30.129 --> 06:31.152
Excuse me.

06:31.220 --> 06:34.001
I have to silently
back away now.

06:34.097 --> 06:36.139
And I... I need a refill.

06:36.216 --> 06:37.688
Come along, dear.

06:38.039 --> 06:40.396
What, am I boring you guys?!

06:40.473 --> 06:43.000
The old man's a snooze, huh?

06:43.077 --> 06:44.835
You're not so perfect!

06:45.096 --> 06:47.994
Simon, I know you're dealing
with a lot of unresolved karma,

06:48.071 --> 06:49.720
but that is no reason to lash out.

06:49.797 --> 06:51.573
What? What are you talking about?

06:51.650 --> 06:53.071
You cry in the night times.

06:53.148 --> 06:54.621
We all hear you crying...

06:54.698 --> 06:56.300
Into baby diapers...

06:56.377 --> 06:58.886
- It's super-sad, dude.
- Oh, come on, guys.

06:58.963 --> 06:59.968
Quit clownin'.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.240
You keep them in my bottom drawer.

07:02.853 --> 07:03.961
Ugh, it's locked.

07:04.038 --> 07:05.086
Whew!

07:05.163 --> 07:06.928
Somebody say
something about a lock?

07:07.005 --> 07:09.632
- No!
- Yeah! Get in here, bro!

07:13.249 --> 07:15.833
This is your truth, Simon.

07:15.910 --> 07:18.312
Hey, hey, give me those!

07:18.484 --> 07:20.266
We know all about your weird stuff,

07:20.343 --> 07:23.007
like how you use penguin
milk as moisturizer.

07:23.084 --> 07:25.593
It helps keep my skin cold and clammy.

07:25.670 --> 07:27.593
He needs to hear more devastating truths.

07:27.670 --> 07:30.226
One time you had food stuck
in your beard for two weeks.

07:30.303 --> 07:31.826
Like a whole burrito.

07:35.176 --> 07:38.532
Gunther, old buddy, you
got to defend me here!

07:41.414 --> 07:45.650
Okay! I get it! I'm a
dang ding-dong, okay?!

07:49.592 --> 07:54.687
Excuse me, friends.
Ice King?

07:54.764 --> 07:56.193
No. Go away.

07:56.270 --> 07:58.323
Dummies only in this corner.

07:58.400 --> 08:03.062
Look, I get it. We're brilliant furniture,
and that's hard to keep up with.

08:03.139 --> 08:05.794
Maybe you could fit in by
being more of a listener.

08:05.871 --> 08:09.248
You could be the cool quiet guy...
the quiet guy who just listens.

08:09.325 --> 08:10.760
You know what I mean?

08:10.837 --> 08:12.408
You know what I mean, right?

08:12.485 --> 08:13.509
Yeah. See?

08:13.610 --> 08:14.825
You get what I mean!

08:14.902 --> 08:16.987
Ice King is so smart!

08:17.558 --> 08:18.713
Noooo!

08:18.790 --> 08:19.952
Stop talking!

08:20.029 --> 08:21.681
I don't like this!

08:21.758 --> 08:23.315
You book lickers!

08:23.392 --> 08:25.548
I made you to be my bros!

08:25.625 --> 08:28.999
Weight set, we were gonna smash
into PB's room together and

08:29.076 --> 08:31.026
show her
how ripped you made me!

08:31.103 --> 08:35.827
Microwave, we were gonna heat up
bologna on white-bread sandwiches!

08:35.914 --> 08:39.534
Drawer dresser, you were
gonna be my improv coach!

08:39.611 --> 08:40.602
Yes...

08:40.738 --> 08:43.057
- And?
- Yes, and...

08:43.134 --> 08:44.331
You, lamp!

08:44.408 --> 08:48.160
I was the most excited
for you to be my friend!

08:48.237 --> 08:52.358
But then you had to go and use words
like I've never heard before...

08:52.435 --> 08:55.347
words that confused and upset me!

08:55.424 --> 08:58.208
Now I have upsetting words for you!

08:58.285 --> 08:59.419
Get out! Get out!

08:59.496 --> 09:00.908
I'm kicking all of you out!

09:00.985 --> 09:02.321
Not so fast, Ice King.

09:02.398 --> 09:04.417
We've been in this place
just as long as you.

09:04.494 --> 09:05.830
We have just as much right to stay.

09:05.907 --> 09:06.968
That's for real.

09:07.045 --> 09:09.673
- What?
- Hey. We outnumber Simon.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.233
Why don't we just vote him out?

09:11.310 --> 09:12.563
Yeah!

09:12.741 --> 09:14.342
Oh, dear.

09:14.443 --> 09:16.591
I got your vote right here!

09:16.668 --> 09:17.815
Yoink!

09:18.160 --> 09:19.179
Hey!

09:19.256 --> 09:21.621
- I'm open!
- Hyup!

09:22.618 --> 09:23.744
Don't you see?

09:23.821 --> 09:26.437
The crown is just another
one of your many hang-ups.

09:26.514 --> 09:28.173
You've got to flip the script, man.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.694
It can be scary, I know.

09:29.771 --> 09:31.979
It's okay if you need to cry into this.

09:32.236 --> 09:33.879
N-no.

09:33.986 --> 09:36.067
Cry, Simon, cry!

09:36.144 --> 09:38.236
Cry, Simon, cry!

09:38.313 --> 09:40.205
No, no...

09:40.326 --> 09:42.106
Cry, Simon, cry!

09:42.183 --> 09:45.123
We don't like you,
but we're here for you!

09:45.562 --> 09:47.958
Noooooooo!

09:51.041 --> 09:52.152
Aha!

09:52.348 --> 09:54.389
Simon, you're being obtuse.

09:54.466 --> 09:56.062
We're gonna help you!

09:56.185 --> 09:58.518
Noooooo!

10:08.024 --> 10:09.466
Oh, Ice King...

10:09.543 --> 10:12.689
To selfishly create life,
then destroy it...

10:12.766 --> 10:14.852
There is no crueler fate.

10:14.929 --> 10:19.248
I tried to be your friend,
but you guys didn't want me,

10:19.325 --> 10:21.079
didn't even give me a shot.

10:21.156 --> 10:22.758
That's cruel.

10:22.835 --> 10:25.536
I've never been that cruel to anyone.

10:27.986 --> 10:29.339
Welp, out ya go.

10:29.416 --> 10:31.083
No!

10:31.944 --> 10:34.212
Can I get out of this now?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.432
- Here's to Wizz Blizz.
- Yeah!

10:39.178 --> 10:41.672
Write in me!
Write in me!

10:41.988 --> 10:45.451
You know, when you invited me over,
I thought it was as friends.

10:45.528 --> 10:48.462
What do you think of me
being your new best friend?

10:48.539 --> 10:49.528
For real!

10:49.605 --> 10:51.734
Hmm.
Never thought of that.

10:51.811 --> 10:53.559
And...?

10:54.145 --> 10:55.731
Nah. No.
