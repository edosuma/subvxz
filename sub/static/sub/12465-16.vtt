Parker:
IT WAS A PEACEFUL DAY
IN DOWNTOWN STEVENS POINT.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.484
(roaring)

00:22.390 --> 00:25.357
CRUSH. KILL. DESTROY.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.237
(slow-motion roar)

00:39.707 --> 00:42.307
(slow-motion roar)

00:47.948 --> 00:49.448
(crashing)

00:51.919 --> 00:53.585
(gasps)

00:55.489 --> 00:57.856
WHAT KIND OF BONKERS
BOY-BUSINESS IS THIS?

00:59.260 --> 01:01.527
UH, WE'RE DESTROYING
FAKE STEVENS POINT.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.830
(robot voice)
CARE TO PARTICIPATE,
INSIGNIFICANT HUMANS?

01:07.001 --> 01:08.267
-YEAH.
-YES.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.874
(cackles)

01:17.278 --> 01:18.944
YES!
OH, THAT FELT GOOD.

01:18.946 --> 01:22.714
HEY, I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THE VIDEO FOOTAGE
FROM THE ROOF CAMERA.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.252
LIV, YOU'RE A HIGH-CLASS
WOMAN OF THE WORLD.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.255
-AWW.
-SO CAN I GET YOUR ADVICE
ON A MATTER OF THE HEART?

01:30.257 --> 01:31.890
YES, OF COURSE.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.293
I LOVE THAT YOU CAME
TO ME, REGINALD.
(laughs)

01:34.295 --> 01:35.461
WHAT'S THE LOVE-ONE-ONE?

01:35.463 --> 01:36.929
I'M CRUSHING
ON AN OLDER GIRL.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.565
NOT SURE HOW TO GET HER
TO NOTICE ME.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.334
OOH, SOMEONE LIKES
THEIR CHEESE AGED.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.470
OKAY, SO TELL ME
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.738
OH, SHE'S GOT IT
GOING ON,

01:46.740 --> 01:48.507
WITH A SMILE
THAT LIGHTS UP THE ROOM.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.576
-BLING!
-OOH.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.912
OKAY, WELL,
MY ADVICE WOULD BE

01:53.914 --> 01:55.547
DRESS TO IMPRESS.
YOU KNOW?

01:55.549 --> 01:56.915
GIVE A HOOT,
WEAR A SUIT.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.884
(giggles)

01:58.885 --> 02:00.852
AND, YOU KNOW,
A HEARTFELT POEM NEVER
GOES OUT OF STYLE, SO.

02:00.855 --> 02:03.355
A POEM,
I COULD FLOW WITH THAT.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.591
YEAH, I BET YOU COULD.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.993
FLOW ON, CASANOVA.

02:11.866 --> 02:12.965
EW.
(giggles)

02:12.967 --> 02:14.333
WHAT'S WITH THAT LOOK?

02:15.069 --> 02:16.802
DID YOU JUST SWALLOW
A BUG OR SOMETHING?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.036
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

02:18.038 --> 02:20.939
YOU'RE THE OLDER GIRL
WITH THE BLING SMILE.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.308
LITTLE REGGIE HAS
A CRUSH ON YOU.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.477
NO.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.645
I MEAN, THANK YOU FOR THE PROPS
ON MY SMILE, MOM, BUT REALLY HE
JUST WANTED MY ADVICE.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.414
UH, TRUST ME.
I KNOW KIDS.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.952
HE WAS VIBING YOU
SO THAT HE DIDN'T
EMBARRASS HIMSELF.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.955
UH, VIBING, IT'S-- AHEM,
JUST A WORD THAT KIDS USE.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.325
YEAH, MOM,
NO ONE USES THAT WORD.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.828
HEY, MOM.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.997
THANKS FOR PICKING ME UP
THESE NEW UNDERWEAR.

02:44.999 --> 02:47.966
I AM TOTALLY VIBING
THESE NEW BOXER BRIEFS.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.836
(laughs, sings a tune)

02:51.805 --> 02:53.372
-I'LL NEVER SAY IT AGAIN.

IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH ONE.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.732
OH, YEAH.
BRING IT.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.033
I WANT MY SWEAT
TO SWEAT.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.104
OKAY, SO, EVER SINCE I CAME BACK
FROM MY KNEE INJURY,

03:59.106 --> 04:02.074
MY BASKETBALL TEAM
HASN'T LOST A GAME!

04:02.076 --> 04:04.977
UGH! MAD DOG IS BACK
AND BETTER THAN EVER!

04:04.979 --> 04:06.745
(sighs)

04:06.747 --> 04:08.013
OH, I CAN'T STOP SMILING.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.116
SEE?
(giggles)

04:11.118 --> 04:13.652
ALL RIGHT, MAD DOG.
LET'S DO THIS.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.886
LET'S DO THIS!

04:14.888 --> 04:16.088
NOT SO FAST, MADDIE.

04:16.090 --> 04:18.056
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR GRADES.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.591
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
MY GRADES?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.126
WELL, YOU'RE
ON ACADEMIC HOLD.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.928
NOW, I'M SORRY, HONEY,
BUT...

04:22.930 --> 04:25.697
I HAVE TO SUSPEND YOU
FROM THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.165
-WHAT?
-YEAH, WHAT?

04:27.167 --> 04:28.967
MOM, I'M ACING EVERY CLASS.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.136
YEAH, SHE'S ACING
EVERY CLASS.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.973
NOT HOME EC.
YOU'RE FAILING.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.609
YEAH, NO, I MEANT
LIKE EVERY REAL CLASS.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.544
RIGHT, DAD?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.915
OKAY, THIS WOULD GENERALLY
BE THE PART WHERE YOU, LIKE,
BACK ME UP.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.451
SORRY, MADDIE.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.620
GRADES COME FIRST.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.022
YEAH, YOUR FATHER'S RIGHT.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.591
NOW, YOU NEED TO GO TALK
TO MR. CLODFELTER.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.093
WHAT? (scoffs)
NO!

04:55.095 --> 05:01.033
(stammering)
I CAN'T TALK TO HIM
BECAUSE HE'S A MONSTER.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.502
(crying)
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME
TALK TO--

05:03.504 --> 05:04.636
ARE YOU GUYS BUYING THIS?

05:05.973 --> 05:08.607
NO?
(scoffs) FINE.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.108
YOU WEREN'T BUYING IT,
EVEN FOR LIKE A SECOND?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.145
(groans)

05:17.051 --> 05:19.584
HEY!
WHERE IS MR. CLODFELTER?

05:21.221 --> 05:23.088
(tires screech)

05:26.593 --> 05:27.759
(screeching continues)

05:33.834 --> 05:35.133
ALL RIGHT, CLASS.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.169
PHONES DOWN, SPOONS UP.
WE'RE MAKING CREPES.

05:37.171 --> 05:40.105
LET'S GET READY
TO WHIP IT AND FLIP IT.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.207
(clears throat loudly)

05:42.209 --> 05:44.276
HMM, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

05:44.278 --> 05:46.111
MADDIE ROONEY.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.713
YOU CAN'T FAIL ME.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.015
WHEN TEACHERS DON'T
FAIL STUDENTS,

05:50.017 --> 05:53.118
STUDENTS FAIL THEMSELVES.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.986
(laughing maniacally)

05:56.690 --> 05:58.223
(laughing continues)

06:06.667 --> 06:09.101
OKAY, BUT IF YOU
DON'T CHANGE MY GRADE,

06:09.103 --> 06:10.936
I AM OFF THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.871
HMM, WELL, IF YOU WANT
TO PASS HOME EC,

06:12.873 --> 06:14.106
YOU GOTTA DO THE WORK.

06:14.108 --> 06:16.541
RESPECT THE EC, YO.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.909
(chirps)

06:18.846 --> 06:21.146
OKAY, SO IF I'M BEING HONEST,

06:21.148 --> 06:25.016
SOME OF MY PROJECTS
DIDN'T EXACTLY... TURN OUT
THE WAY I HAD HOPED.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.119
SHE MADE ME LASAGNA.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.788
OR A DOORSTOP.
I CAN'T TELL.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.125
SHE MADE ME A SWEATSHIRT.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.894
I DON'T LET HER
MAKE ME ANYTHING.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.129
LIFE'S TOO SHORT.

06:38.132 --> 06:40.699
OKAY, SO HOME EC
ISN'T EXACTLY MY BAG,

06:40.701 --> 06:43.068
BUT ISN'T THERE ANYTHING
THAT I CAN DO FOR EXTRA CREDIT?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.904
WELL, THERE IS ONE THING
THAT YOU CAN DO.

06:45.906 --> 06:49.708
WIN THE CLODFELTER
COOKING COMPETITION
THIS FRIDAY.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.876
OKAY, I'M IN.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.112
WHO AM I GONNA MAKE CRY
WHEN I BEAT THEM?

06:54.114 --> 06:57.282
FUNNY, I WAS JUST ASKING
MYSELF THE SAME THING.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.985
(laughing maniacally)

07:02.856 --> 07:04.089
WAIT.
OKAY...

07:04.091 --> 07:07.092
I HAVE TO BEAT ARTIE
TO GET BACK ON THE TEAM?

07:08.028 --> 07:11.696
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN
THE GOURMET TREATS THAT HE
DROPS OFF TO WOO LIV?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.799
BECAUSE HE CALLS THIS ONE

07:13.801 --> 07:16.968
A "LIV AND ARTIE BERRY TARTIE."

07:17.905 --> 07:20.639
HELLO, MY STAR SOUS-CHEF.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.141
OH, RIGHT BACK AT YOU,
MY CULINARY KING.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.776
(chuckles)

07:25.712 --> 07:29.381
SO, MISS ROONEY
VERSUS CHEF ARTIE.

07:29.383 --> 07:32.034
DO YOU FEEL
YOU'RE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE,

07:32.035 --> 07:34.686
OR ARE YOU GOING TO DEFLATE
LIKE A BAD CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.788
(both laughing hysterically)

07:37.991 --> 07:39.291
(laughing continues)

07:42.629 --> 07:44.129
(laughing continues)

07:52.306 --> 07:54.873
OH, LOOKY, LOOKY.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.241
DADDY'S PLAYING HOOKY.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.877
WHERE ARE YOU
SNEAKING OFF TO?

07:58.879 --> 08:01.046
ARE YOU A VOLUNTEER FIREMAN?

08:01.048 --> 08:03.081
NO, WAIT, A SPY.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.084
(gasps)
A FIRE SPY.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.386
WHAT'S A FIRE SPY?

08:08.388 --> 08:09.888
OH, IS THAT
A SECRET TOO?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.122
DAD, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TELL ME.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.390
DADDY, PLEASE TELL ME!

08:12.392 --> 08:14.059
OKAY.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.928
LISTEN.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.796
I HAVE A FEW FREE PERIODS
BETWEEN CLASSES,

08:17.798 --> 08:19.397
SO I'M HEADING OUT
TO CATCH A MOVIE.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.783
OH, WHAT MOVIE?

08:21.784 --> 08:24.168
(announcer voice)
IN A WORLD WHERE
GLADIATORS NEED FRIENDS,

08:24.171 --> 08:25.237
THERE IS...

08:25.239 --> 08:28.240
Both:
<i>THE GLADIATOR GANG.</i>

08:29.810 --> 08:32.143
I REALLY WANT
TO SEE THAT MOVIE.
CAN I COME?

08:32.145 --> 08:35.113
JOEY, I CAN'T TAKE YOU
OUT OF SCHOOL
TO SEE A MOVIE.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.982
-(sighs)
-(honking)

08:40.988 --> 08:43.788
OH, COME ON.
THOSE WEIRD MOOSE KIDS
GET TO LEAVE.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.156
THEY'RE GOING
ON A FIELD TRIP.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.125
THAT'S
THE MOOSE ENTHUSIASTS CLUB.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.860
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
WELL...

08:48.862 --> 08:51.363
<i>THE GLADIATOR GANG</i>
IS SET IN ANCIENT ROME.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.299
THE ANCIENT ROMAN HISTORY
CLUB IS BORN.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.202
NICE TRY, JOEY,

08:57.204 --> 08:59.804
BUT SCHOOL COMES
BEFORE MOVIES.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.439
(scoffs)
DAD...

09:01.441 --> 09:03.942
I HAVE TWO FREE PERIODS
WITH A LUNCH IN BETWEEN,

09:03.944 --> 09:05.977
A 4.3 GPA,

09:05.979 --> 09:09.047
AND I JUST SO HAPPEN
TO HAVE POPCORN
IN MY POCKET.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.182
DON'T ASK ME WHY.

09:12.486 --> 09:13.852
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.254
LET'S DO IT.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.392
HOW OLD IS THIS POPCORN?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.193
I DON'T KNOW.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.295
HOW OLD IS THIS SWEATER?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.069
OM...

09:31.071 --> 09:32.237
OM...

09:36.843 --> 09:38.043
WOW.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.444
REGGIE, YOU LOOK SO GREAT.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.313
THANKS, LIV.
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

09:41.315 --> 09:43.114
DRESSING TO IMPRESS
MY GIRL.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.083
I WROTE A POEM TOO.
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.217
OKAY.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.154
BLING! BLANG!

09:49.156 --> 09:50.789
MY GREEN-EYED GIRL SINGS,

09:50.791 --> 09:52.023
BLASTOFF,

09:52.025 --> 09:53.325
SHE'S A ROCKET,

09:53.327 --> 09:55.160
IN ORBIT AROUND MY HEART.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.332
THIS IS MY HEART.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.001
IT'S BEATING.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.402
(laughs)

10:04.404 --> 10:06.304
AH, YES.
I CAN SEE THAT.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.040
WELL, GOTTA FIND DR. P.
STAY PRETTY.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.408
OKAY.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.013
OKAY, SO MAYBE REGGIE
DOES HAVE A CRUSH ON--

10:15.015 --> 10:18.149
I SAID THAT!
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THAT?
DOES MOMMA KNOW KIDS, OR WHAT?

10:20.821 --> 10:23.254
MOM, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO LET SOMEONE DOWN
WHEN THEY'RE AS SWEET AS THAT?

10:23.256 --> 10:26.191
OH, HONEY,
JUST BE DELICATE

10:26.193 --> 10:28.493
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY
THE FIRST CRUSH
HE'S EVER HAD.

10:29.429 --> 10:33.031
THE WAY YOU TREAT HIM
WILL AFFECT EVERY RELATIONSHIP
HE EVER HAS.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.966
EVER.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.537
(laughs nervously)
OKAY, MOM, THAT'S KIND OF,
LIKE, A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.439
OH, HONEY, I'M NOT TRYING
TO PUT PRESSURE ON YOU.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.341
JUST REMEMBER HOW TIGHT
HE IS WITH PARKER.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.943
YOU DON'T WANT
TO DESTROY THAT FRIENDSHIP.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.144
I DO NOT ENVY
BEING YOU RIGHT NOW.

10:46.146 --> 10:51.149
-MOM, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
-YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST MARRY HIM.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.298
AS FACULTY ADVISOR
OF THE TERMINAL VELOCITY CLUB,

11:07.300 --> 11:11.102
I MUST SAY,
I LOVE SKYDIVING.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.407
AFTER OUR FIELD TRIP
TO THE GLADIATOR MOVIE,

11:15.409 --> 11:19.911
JOEY AND I REALIZED THERE WERE
A LOT OF EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE.

11:19.913 --> 11:23.214
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS START THE RIGHT CLUB.

11:23.216 --> 11:26.584
(air hissing)

11:26.585 --> 11:29.953
THE COMPRESSED-AIR FISHING CLUB
WENT SCUBA DIVING
IN LAKE HACHEEMACHEE.

11:31.191 --> 11:35.060
THE ENHANCED ENGINEERING CLUB
WENT TO THE MONSTER TRUCK RALLY.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.494
I GOT THIS HAT

11:36.496 --> 11:39.264
AND A HEALTHY FEAR
OF LARGE TRUCKS.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.439
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

11:47.441 --> 11:50.275
CAN'T TELL WHETHER THAT'S
COMING FROM THE OVEN
OR MY BUTT.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.447
IT IS CHICKEN
AND DUMPLINGS.

11:56.616 --> 12:00.385
IT'S ACTUALLY
MR. CLODFELTER'S FAVORITE DISH.

12:00.387 --> 12:04.522
ALTHOUGH, I'M KIND OF
JUST NOW REALIZING THAT
MY DUMPLINGS ARE A LITTLE DUMPY.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.460
YEAH, WELL,
THE FUMES ARE BURNING MY NOSE.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.994
WE NEED SOME FRESH AIR.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.200
<i>HOLA,  </i> ROONEYS.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.534
WELL...

12:17.604 --> 12:20.038
NOW I KNOW
WHAT THE BUTT SMELL WAS.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.474
PUT A SOCK IN IT,
SASS MOUTH.

12:22.476 --> 12:26.678
I'M JUST HERE TO DROP OFF
MY WEEKLY DELIVERY
FOR MY FUTURE WIFE,

12:26.680 --> 12:28.046
LIV ROONEY.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.054
(humming cherubic note)

12:37.424 --> 12:39.591
YOU MADE A WEDDING CAKE?

12:39.593 --> 12:41.693
YOU DO KNOW
LIV HATES YOU, RIGHT?

12:44.231 --> 12:47.031
THERE'S A FINE LINE
BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE, CHILD.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.135
(sighs)

12:50.137 --> 12:52.971
HEY, ARTIE,
COULD YOU DO ME
THIS REALLY BIG FAVOR

12:52.973 --> 12:55.273
AND JUST KIND OF BOW
OUT OF THE COMPETITION?

12:55.275 --> 12:58.143
'CAUSE I REALLY NEED TO WIN,
OR ELSE THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET ME
PLAY BASKETBALL ANYMORE.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.112
(clicks tongue)
HMM, I COULD DO THAT,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.248
BUT I WON'T.
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.184
IT'S REALLY MORE
OF A YES OR NO QUESTION.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.119
I'LL TELL YOU WHY!

13:08.120 --> 13:10.053
'TWAS A CRISP OCTOBER DAY,
SIX YEARS AGO.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.389
I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER THE REST.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.224
NOPE.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.427
WE WERE AT RECESS,
PICKING TEAMS FOR DODGEBALL.
RING A BELL?

13:16.429 --> 13:20.198
-NOT A DING.
-I STOOD BY, HOPING THAT
DODGE DYNAMO MADISON ROONEY

13:20.200 --> 13:22.600
WOULD LOOK MY WAY
AND PICK ME FOR HER TEAM.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.135
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
SOMETHING I WOULD DO.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.171
AND YOU DIDN'T!

13:26.173 --> 13:29.440
I WAS STUCK PLAYING
DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE
WITH THE KINDERGARTENERS.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.243
OH, I REMEMBER THAT.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.679
YOU WERE GOOSE
FOR, LIKE, A WHOLE WEEK.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.550
WAIT, YOU'RE MAD AT ME

13:38.552 --> 13:41.986
BECAUSE I DIDN'T PICK YOU
FOR DODGEBALL IN GRADE SCHOOL?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.155
NOT MAD, MY SWEET,

13:44.157 --> 13:45.223
MOTIVATED.

13:45.225 --> 13:50.228
YOU TOOK MY DODGEBALL HOPES,
NOW I WILL TAKE
YOUR BASKETBALL DREAMS.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.629
LISTEN, ARTIE.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.199
NO ONE THREATENS
MY SISTER, EXCEPT FOR ME.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.067
NOW BEAT IT, GOOSE.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.536
FINE.
I WAS LEAVING ANYWAY.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.607
OH, CAN ONE OF YOU TAKE
A PICTURE OF LIV EATING THIS--

14:02.609 --> 14:04.142
-OUT.
-NO.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.345
(groans)

14:07.347 --> 14:10.114
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA BEAT ARTIE.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.383
I AM GONNA FAIL HOME EC
AND BE BENCHED FOREVER.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.053
ARE YOU REALLY GIVING UP
THAT EASILY?

14:15.055 --> 14:17.555
YOU WORKED SO HARD
TO GET BACK ON THE TEAM.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.591
COME ON, MADDIE.
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE
TO COOK SOMETHING.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.128
(stammers)
I JUST DON'T CARE
ABOUT COOKING, YOU KNOW.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.648
THE ONLY THING
I REALLY CARE ABOUT
IS BASKETBALL.

14:26.649 --> 14:29.167
WELL, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO CHANNEL THAT PASSION
INTO FOOD.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.537
WE'RE TOTALLY EATING
LIV'S WEDDING CAKE
FIRST THOUGH, RIGHT?

14:32.539 --> 14:33.671
AH, CHYEA.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.206
SICK!

14:39.613 --> 14:42.080
(both moaning)

14:49.356 --> 14:51.222
HEY, LIV.
WHAT YOU UP TO?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.224
OH, JUST BRUSHING MY TEETH.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.285
WHOA.

15:03.286 --> 15:05.303
OKAY, SO I DECIDED
THE BEST WAY TO KEEP
SWEET, LITTLE REGGIE

15:05.305 --> 15:09.240
FROM FEELING REJECTED
WAS TO GET HIM
TO REJECT ME FIRST.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.709
(lisping)
SORRY YOU HAVE TO SEE
ME LIKE THIS.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.811
(laughing)

15:14.748 --> 15:17.682
YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU
REALLY HAVE A THING
FOR THOSE BLING SMILES.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.502
SO...

15:20.503 --> 15:23.321
HUH, I'VE GOTTA SAY, LIV,
I ADMIRE YOU FOR LETTING ME
SEE YOUR TRUE SELF.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.555
MAD RESPECT.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.192
WHAT? NO!
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REJECT ME.

15:29.129 --> 15:32.430
BECAUSE OF YOUR TEETH?
WHAT TYPE OF SUPERFICIAL MONSTER
DO YOU THINK I AM?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.133
(clears throat)

15:36.636 --> 15:38.636
OKAY.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.805
COME HERE.
UM...

15:42.342 --> 15:43.675
SO, REGGIE...

15:44.644 --> 15:46.444
YOU...

15:46.446 --> 15:48.279
ARE A VERY, VERY
SWEET BOY.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.116
AND, YOU KNOW,
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE

15:52.118 --> 15:54.218
IS THE PERFECT GIRL FOR YOU.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.554
AND WHEN YOU MEET HER,

15:56.555 --> 15:58.889
SHE'S GONNA HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO ORBIT
AROUND YOUR HEART.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.727
BUT WE REALLY NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS CRUSH THAT YOU HAVE

16:02.729 --> 16:05.163
ON THIS GREEN-EYED,
OLDER GIRL.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.197
YOU KNOW?

16:06.199 --> 16:07.899
I THINK WE BOTH
KNOW WHO IT IS.

16:07.901 --> 16:09.834
OH, YOU KNOW CLARISSA TOO?

16:09.836 --> 16:11.602
YEAH, I DO.
WAIT. NO! WHAT?

16:11.604 --> 16:12.737
NO.
WHO'S CLARISSA?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.640
A GIRL FROM MY KARATE DOJO.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.142
(laughs)
OKAY, BUT HOLD ON.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.578
YOU SAID YOU HAD
A CRUSH ON AN OLDER GIRL.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.480
YEAH, SHE'S THREE MONTHS
OLDER THAN ME.

16:25.251 --> 16:28.453
WAIT, YOU DIDN'T THINK
I MEANT YOU, DID YOU?

16:28.455 --> 16:31.189
YEAH, NO, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT I THOUGHT THAT.
YES.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.194
WAS THIS DISGUSTING,
SLOBBERY MESS YOUR WAY
OF LETTING ME DOWN EASY?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.464
IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT IT WAS, YES.

16:40.934 --> 16:45.336
LIV, YOU'RE CUTE,
BUT YOU'RE A LITTLE
IMMATURE FOR ME.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.574
DON'T WORRY.
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A NICE GUY.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.509
OH, THAT ARTIE DUDE
SEEMS INTO YOU.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.677
WANT ME TO HOOK IT UP?

16:53.947 --> 16:55.279
GET OUT.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.224
I AM SO EXCITED
TO MINI GOLF.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.692
AND IS IT JUST ME,

17:07.694 --> 17:11.329
OR DO I LOOK GREAT
IN THESE TINY ELF PANTS?

17:12.966 --> 17:15.233
WELL, LOOKY, LOOKY.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.302
TWO ROONEYS
PLAYING HOOKY.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.706
WE HAVE PERMISSION SLIPS
SIGNED BY OUR FACULTY ADVISOR.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.976
LET IT GO.
IT'S OVER, SON

17:24.978 --> 17:27.211
(chuckles)
OH, IT'S NOT OVER.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.980
-IT'S NOT?
-OH, NO.

17:28.982 --> 17:32.250
NO, I JUST HAD TO OPEN
YOUR CLUB UP TO NEW MEMBERSHIPS.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.786
SO, LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
SOME GUESTS

17:34.788 --> 17:36.687
HI, GUYS.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.823
THE MOOSE ENTHUSIAST CLUB.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.925
YEAH, AND THEY DON'T WANT
TO MINI GOLF.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.927
THEY JUST WANT
TO SIT IN THE WOODS, YOU KNOW.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.896
JUST HOPE THAT
A MOOSE WALKS BY.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.334
WELL, CAN'T GET
ANY WORSE.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.870
(honking)

17:54.007 --> 17:55.506
(sustained note)

17:57.243 --> 18:00.812
HELLO, ROONEYS.
I HEAR WE'RE GOING
MOOSING TOGETHER.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.380

18:05.718 --> 18:07.518
(sighs)

18:07.520 --> 18:08.686
I STAND CORRECTED.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.521
IT GOT WORSE.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.291
WELL, HAVE FUN, BOYS.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.625

18:38.017 --> 18:40.852

18:41.988 --> 18:45.056
I HAD TO USE ME PENSION MONEY
TO HAVE THIS
LIFTY-THING INSTALLED.

18:45.058 --> 18:45.990
WORTH EVERY PENNY.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.027
CHEF ARTIE,
PRESENT YOUR PLATE.

18:54.901 --> 18:58.035
WHY DID THE CHICKEN DUMPLINGS
CROSS THE ROAD?

18:58.037 --> 18:59.303

MY FAVORITE DISH.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.381
MMM.

19:18.992 --> 19:22.326
SOMEONE HAS BEEN READING
MY SELF-PUBLISHED MEMOIR...

19:23.963 --> 19:27.665

22:42.945 --> 22:45.096
NOTHING, CERTAINLY NOT TALKING
TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE,

22:45.098 --> 22:47.098
PRETENDING I HAVE
MY OWN COOKING SHOW.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.000
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:50.002 --> 22:51.969
I WAS JUST GONNA SHOW
LIV MY SNACKADIUM.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.205
SORRY, KID.
I ATE IT.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.973
OH.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.142
WELL, THEN...

22:58.144 --> 23:02.380
MAYBE WE COULD TEACH
THE IMAGINARY FOLKS AT HOME
HOW TO MAKE

23:02.382 --> 23:04.782
THEIR VERY OWN SNACKADIUM!

23:04.784 --> 23:07.084
