All right, listen, I know
that men of a certain age,

11:44.210 --> 11:45.960
it's common for you guys
to define your manhood

11:45.960 --> 11:48.170
in very narrow terms.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.590
Yeah, in the terms
of their manhood.

11:49.590 --> 11:51.790
But that--that is not
an evolved paradigm.

11:51.790 --> 11:55.050
The more rigidly you view it,

11:55.050 --> 11:56.790
the more pressure you put
on yourself.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.790
If you could avoid using

11:58.790 --> 12:00.790

to be performative.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.090
It's much more expansive
than that.

12:07.090 --> 12:08.840
It's about how you--
how you approach life.

12:08.840 --> 12:12.000
It's about how
you perceive yourself.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.790
And to tell you the truth,
this kind of stuff gets fixed

12:13.790 --> 12:16.050

relax and do nothing.

12:16.050 --> 12:18.790

12:18.790 --> 12:22.300
