WEBVTT

00:03.135 --> 00:04.703
Oh-oh-oh.

00:06.939 --> 00:09.240
Lemon meringue.

00:10.242 --> 00:12.276
All right.

00:14.546 --> 00:17.616
Don't touch that pie!

00:17.617 --> 00:19.951
That's for after dinner.
I wasn't gonna touch it.

00:19.952 --> 00:23.421
What are you doin' with a fork?
I had a little itch.

00:23.422 --> 00:26.691
Stop. Boys, come on,
we gotta go!

00:26.692 --> 00:29.560
Why do we have to
go to the doctor
if we're not sick?

00:29.561 --> 00:31.195
For check-ups.

00:32.497 --> 00:34.165
What's in the bag?

00:34.166 --> 00:36.434
Something that's
gonna cut time off
my doctor's appointment.

00:36.435 --> 00:37.936
What?

00:37.937 --> 00:41.606
You know how the doctor
makes you go pee in the cup?

00:41.607 --> 00:44.943
That's my favorite part.

00:44.944 --> 00:49.281
Except the cup is too small.
I'll go with a salad bowl
for me, huh?

00:49.282 --> 00:52.451
Whew.
Yeah, well, my problem is,
I can't go under pressure.

00:52.452 --> 00:56.655
So you went in that bag?

00:56.656 --> 01:00.024
Tsk, of course not.
I put it in a yogurt container.

01:01.494 --> 01:06.297
I think he just found a flavor
that'll never catch on.

01:06.298 --> 01:08.967
We'll be back around 5:30.

01:08.968 --> 01:12.436
All right. Watch those
speed bumps.
Bye-bye.

01:15.741 --> 01:18.510
<i>(door opens)</i> stay away
from that pie!

02:20.272 --> 02:24.075
<i>(boys yell and argue)</i>

02:24.076 --> 02:25.743
<i>(jill)</i> mark...

02:25.744 --> 02:27.946
<i>(all talk at once)</i>

02:33.819 --> 02:35.353
We're back.

02:35.354 --> 02:37.488
What kept you guys?

02:37.489 --> 02:40.725
The doctor found
boysenberry yogurt
in brad's urine.

02:44.931 --> 02:48.266
So I had to
give him another sample
without any fruit in it.

02:48.267 --> 02:51.402
Also, randy
had to go to another doctor
and get a second blood test.

02:51.403 --> 02:53.304
Why?

02:53.305 --> 02:56.340
It's mom's fault.
She told dr. Medwick
I been kinda tired lately.

02:56.341 --> 03:00.212
You have been.
I caught you on the couch
the other day asleep at 4:00.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.313
Dad, I was watching
<i>tool time.</i>

03:04.616 --> 03:07.752
Why don't you go do
your homework? We'll call you
when dinner's ready.

03:07.753 --> 03:09.387
Ok.

03:09.388 --> 03:11.389
<i>Tool time's</i> not that bad,
is it?

03:11.390 --> 03:13.458
Tim, we have to talk.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.226
What's the matter?

03:15.227 --> 03:17.228
It's about the doctor.

03:17.229 --> 03:21.666
Dr. Medwick wanted the extra
blood test because he was
concerned about something

03:21.667 --> 03:23.768
That he felt in randy's neck.

03:23.769 --> 03:25.770
What did he feel?
Some swelling.

03:25.771 --> 03:27.371
Swelling?
Yeah.

03:27.372 --> 03:30.875
So he
sent us across the hall
to this endocrinologist,

03:30.876 --> 03:33.611
Dr. Kaufman, and she said
she thought she felt a lump.

03:33.612 --> 03:36.881
What kind of a lump?
A lump on his thyroid gland.

03:36.882 --> 03:39.818
She said they're
usually benign.
Oh, god.

03:39.819 --> 03:42.254
No, that's the good one.
Oh, good.

03:42.255 --> 03:45.022
But there is
a very slight chance

03:45.023 --> 03:47.592
That it could be malignant.

03:47.593 --> 03:51.829
<i>(exhales)</i>

03:51.830 --> 03:55.433
She said that it's usually
very treatable.

03:55.434 --> 04:00.272
It also could be something
they call hypothyroidism.

04:00.273 --> 04:01.839
Hypo what?

04:01.840 --> 04:05.243
It's an underactive thyroid.
It means he'd have to take
a pill

04:05.244 --> 04:07.612
Every day
for the rest of his life,

04:07.613 --> 04:09.914
But other than that,
he'd be totally normal.

04:09.915 --> 04:11.916
Ahem, boy...

04:11.917 --> 04:17.122
So it's either a lump
or hypothymaster?

04:17.123 --> 04:20.491
Hypothyroidism.

04:20.492 --> 04:23.761
Now, there's
a third possibility,

04:23.762 --> 04:28.233
And that is that it could
just be a simple goiter.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.367
A goiter?

04:29.368 --> 04:30.601
That's nothing.

04:30.602 --> 04:32.670
So we want a goiter?
Yes, we want a goiter.

04:34.673 --> 04:37.275
You know, a goiter
is just a swelling,

04:37.276 --> 04:39.777
But it means that the thyroid
is functioning normally.

04:39.778 --> 04:41.879
Why didn't you call me?
I would've come down there.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.182
I couldn't do that.
I didn't want randy to know
what's going on

04:44.183 --> 04:46.184
Until we know what
we're dealing with.

04:46.185 --> 04:48.018
So he doesn't know
anything about this?

04:48.019 --> 04:50.020
No,
none of the kids do.

04:50.021 --> 04:53.291
The whole way home,
I kept just telling randy
that nothing was wrong,

04:53.292 --> 04:56.760
He was probably just rundown,
needs some vitamins.

04:56.761 --> 04:58.929
Meanwhile, I'm going
out of my mind.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.931
I thought I was going to
the doctor for a check-up.

05:00.932 --> 05:03.501
Next thing I know, I'm talking
to a specialist about lumps.

05:03.502 --> 05:05.136
Hey, come on.

05:05.137 --> 05:07.038
This is my worst nightmare.

05:07.039 --> 05:09.240
No, no. It's my worst
nightmare, too, ok?

05:09.241 --> 05:11.376
All right. When do we hear
something back from them?

05:11.377 --> 05:17.115
Um, dr. Kaufman said that
she'd call by 6:00 tomorrow.

05:17.116 --> 05:20.218
And we want a goiter?
Yes, we want a goiter.

05:20.219 --> 05:23.655
So, how do we get through
the next 24 hours?

05:23.656 --> 05:27.859
Think real positive,
just hope those tests
come out proving that -

05:27.860 --> 05:29.728
Um, the laundry detergent

05:29.729 --> 05:32.530
Does get
our brights brighter
and our whites whiter.

05:32.531 --> 05:35.500
Yeah. You know, I think
it's gonna make the sheets

05:35.501 --> 05:37.669
Much softer
and more luxurious.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.306
Yes, and I like that
because it makes me
feel pampered.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.782
What are you doing?
I need sugar.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.984
You won't find much in there.

06:03.362 --> 06:06.864
Ah, smells good.
Where am I?

06:09.134 --> 06:11.669
I'm making a big
family breakfast -

06:11.670 --> 06:13.671
Eggs, bacon
and silver-dollar pancakes.

06:13.672 --> 06:15.673
That's randy's favorite.

06:15.674 --> 06:18.543
You're gonna
tip him off, honey.
What do you mean?

06:18.544 --> 06:20.611
You make randy
something edible,

06:20.612 --> 06:22.580
He's gonna know
there's something wrong.

06:22.581 --> 06:26.184
Where are you going?
To work. I want you to call me
if you hear anything, all right?

06:26.185 --> 06:28.253
How could you possibly
go to work today?

06:28.254 --> 06:31.155
If I sit around and wait
for the doctor to call,
I go crazy.

06:31.156 --> 06:33.357
I gotta keep busy,
which is something
you should think about.

06:33.358 --> 06:36.527
I'm gonna be plenty busy
going over and over this
in my mind.

06:36.528 --> 06:39.364
Honey, come on.
It'll be all right.

06:39.365 --> 06:42.099
I can't believe it.
Yesterday, everything's fine.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.268
Today, we're talking about
something as serious -

06:44.269 --> 06:47.238
As fabric softeners.

06:47.239 --> 06:50.074
Yeah, well, you know,
there's nothing worse
than static cling.

06:50.075 --> 06:52.610
That's why we need
fabric softener.

06:54.079 --> 06:56.914
What's going on here?
Nothin'.

06:56.915 --> 06:59.917
Mom, if you're
cooking food like this,
something's gotta be up.

06:59.918 --> 07:03.087
We usually get burnt toast
and mushy bananas.

07:03.088 --> 07:05.356
It's our anniversary.

07:05.357 --> 07:08.092
Your anniversary
was two months ago.

07:11.496 --> 07:15.166
This is the anniversary
of the first time we had eggs.

07:20.939 --> 07:23.941
Well, then,
happy anniversary.

07:23.942 --> 07:25.610
Thanks.

07:28.647 --> 07:32.149
You're right. It's gonna
tip 'em off. We have to
get rid of all this food.

07:32.150 --> 07:35.786
Don't throw it out.
Honey!

07:35.787 --> 07:38.222
Why are you
throwing those out?

07:38.223 --> 07:40.725
I love
silver-dollar pancakes.

07:40.726 --> 07:43.394
There's a good reason
for that.

07:43.395 --> 07:44.696
What?

07:44.697 --> 07:48.066
'cause I'm gonna
take you to breakfast.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.334
You are?

07:49.335 --> 07:51.368
Yeah. Grab your coat.

07:51.369 --> 07:53.203
Let's go out for breakfast,
you and I,

07:53.204 --> 07:55.139
Stop by the video arcade,
play a little mortal massacre.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.141
I'll be late for history.

07:57.142 --> 07:59.410
Son, how many times
have I told you?

07:59.411 --> 08:01.545
You can't live in the past.

08:02.548 --> 08:03.881
Mom?

08:03.882 --> 08:05.883
Oh, it's fine with me.
That's great.

08:05.884 --> 08:07.651
Let's go.
Great.

08:07.652 --> 08:10.754
Man, this is awesome,
skipping school,

08:10.755 --> 08:13.458
Going out to breakfast,
mortal massacre.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.493
I can't believe you guys
are treain' me so good.

08:15.494 --> 08:19.029
If I didn't know better,
I'd think I was dyin'.
<i>(dish drops)</i>

08:21.867 --> 08:24.335
That was a joke, guys.

08:24.336 --> 08:26.437
Ha-ha. That was a joke.

08:26.438 --> 08:29.473
I didn't get it at first,
but I just got it. I got it.

08:29.474 --> 08:33.278
Tell your mom.
Make sure she got it.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.880
What's goin' on?

08:35.881 --> 08:39.884
This have anything to do
with that blood test
I took yesterday?

08:39.885 --> 08:44.422
Ok, yeah, but there's
nothing for you
to worry about.

08:44.423 --> 08:47.592
Do you remember when
the doctor was feeling
your neck yesterday?

08:47.593 --> 08:49.059
Yeah.

08:49.060 --> 08:52.029
Well, um, she felt
some swelling

08:52.030 --> 08:54.399
Which might be
a goiter.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.100
Which is nothing.

08:56.101 --> 08:59.337
Then why don't they
call it nothing
instead of a goiter?

08:59.338 --> 09:01.538
Well, they're not exactly
the same thing.

09:01.539 --> 09:04.641
You couldn't say,
"tigers - 8,
yankees - goiter."

09:15.120 --> 09:17.989
So if it's not a goiter,
then what is it?

09:17.990 --> 09:20.057
It also could be
hypothyroidism,

09:20.058 --> 09:22.092
Which just means you have
an underactive thyroid,

09:22.093 --> 09:24.228
And you have to
take a pill every day.

09:24.229 --> 09:26.097
A very small one.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.132
So you guys are
treating me like this

09:28.133 --> 09:31.369
All because I might have to
take a pill? I don't buy it.

09:32.938 --> 09:35.506
Honey, we didn't
wanna worry you

09:35.507 --> 09:37.508
Until the test results
came back,

09:37.509 --> 09:41.078
But there's also
a small chance...
A very small chance.

09:41.079 --> 09:43.581
...That you might have
a lump on your thyroid

09:43.582 --> 09:46.651
That eventually
would have to be removed.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.386
So I'd need
an operation?

09:48.387 --> 09:50.288
A very small one.

09:51.456 --> 09:52.823
Would I have a scar?

09:52.824 --> 09:54.625
A very small one.

09:55.860 --> 10:00.231
Dr. Kaufman is going to call
by 6:00 tonight.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.500
She's a very small
doctor.

10:05.870 --> 10:08.439
Well, I better
get to school.

10:08.440 --> 10:12.376
You can stay home
if you want today, honey.
We could just talk.

10:12.377 --> 10:14.511
There's nothing
to talk about.
I'm fine.

10:14.512 --> 10:16.647
What about the arcade?

10:16.648 --> 10:18.583
I really shouldn't
miss history.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.284
Well, ok.

10:20.285 --> 10:21.418
Bye.

10:25.691 --> 10:28.626
You're right,
I tipped him off.

10:28.627 --> 10:32.964
What kind of mother am I?
I had to go and fix him
a decent breakfast.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.170
Heidi, did
anybody call for me,
like jill or anybody?

10:40.171 --> 10:43.307
No. That's the third time
you asked. Is everything ok?

10:43.308 --> 10:44.375
Everything's fine.

10:44.376 --> 10:45.777
You sure?
Yeah.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.345
Ok. Good show, al.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.953
You know, tim, far be it
from me to criticize
a colleague,

10:55.954 --> 10:59.657
But your performance
out there today was...
Was a little dull.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.759
Who would know better
than the human yawn?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.861
<i>(yawns)</i>

11:03.862 --> 11:06.597
What was the matter with you
out there?

11:06.598 --> 11:08.933
Didn't get enough sleep
last night.

11:08.934 --> 11:11.401
Polish food again?
No.

11:11.402 --> 11:15.506
Mexican? That makes my mother
go back and forth, back -

11:15.507 --> 11:19.576
Al... Thanks
for wrecking my appetite
for the rest of my life.

11:19.577 --> 11:22.179
This has nothing to do
with what I ate last night.

11:22.180 --> 11:25.349
Then why couldn't you sleep?
I had something on my mind.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.985
Is there something wrong
with the family?
No.

11:27.986 --> 11:30.754
Well, is it...
Is it me?

11:30.755 --> 11:32.923
Have I let you down
in any way?

11:32.924 --> 11:36.494
Al, you've let me down
in every way.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.829
It's not about you and me.
It's nothing. May I?

11:38.830 --> 11:40.464
Then what is it?
Nothing.

11:40.465 --> 11:44.869
Tim, I am a friend, and I sense
that there is something wrong,

11:44.870 --> 11:48.206
And I'm going
to keep reaching out
until you reach back.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.873
Oh, god.

11:51.443 --> 11:53.945
Share with me, tim.

11:53.946 --> 11:55.747
Promise you won't
tell anybody?

11:55.748 --> 11:57.214
I promise.

11:57.215 --> 12:00.951
Came home last night,
and jill told me

12:00.952 --> 12:03.720
That she was having an affair
with the milkman.

12:06.658 --> 12:10.128
No, I cannot believe that.

12:10.129 --> 12:12.697
You have a milkman?

12:15.233 --> 12:17.368
Not anymore.

12:22.006 --> 12:24.942
Maybe I should try
the doctor again.

12:27.045 --> 12:30.214
When was the last time
I called?

12:30.215 --> 12:33.451
Well, right before
you asked me that question.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.653
I don't understand
why this stuff
keeps happening to randy.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.655
He's always been the one
with health problems.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.756
He had allergies, asthma.

12:39.757 --> 12:43.561
Even as a baby,
he had awful colic.

12:43.562 --> 12:46.230
Oh-oh, randy's colic.

12:46.231 --> 12:49.734
I remember
when tim used to walk him
back and forth in the yard,

12:49.735 --> 12:52.369
Trying to get him to sleep.

12:52.370 --> 12:56.707
As a matter of fact, that's
when tim and I first met.

Buddy, come on. Huh?

13:10.923 --> 13:12.757
Hidey-ho, new neighbor.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.092
Huh? Hidey what?

13:15.093 --> 13:17.361
Just a little expression
of mine.

13:17.362 --> 13:21.032
Oh, yeah, sure. Just a little -
ha-ha, ho-ho-ho.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.267
What in the world
was that strange noise?

13:23.268 --> 13:27.170
That's just
an expression of mine.

13:27.171 --> 13:31.075
Um, hope my kid's crying
didn't wake you up, sir.

13:31.076 --> 13:33.878
No. I was already up
feeding my pet octopus.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.649
So, I've been
meaning to come over
and introduce myself.

13:38.650 --> 13:41.318
I'm wilson wilson.

13:41.319 --> 13:43.954
Um, I'm tim-tim taylor.
How are you?

13:43.955 --> 13:46.257
And the little one with
the supercharged lungs

13:46.258 --> 13:49.160
Is my youngest son randy.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.461
Got a little colic.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.463
I know. I've been hearing him
for the past few nights.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.931
Sorry about that.

13:53.932 --> 13:55.766
I took the liberty
to mix you up a batch

13:55.767 --> 13:57.902
Of ginger-root juice
for your son's colic.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.438
And I'm supposed to put that
in his bottle?

14:00.439 --> 14:02.673
No. You just rub
a little bit on his belly.

14:02.674 --> 14:04.942
All right. At this point,
I'm willing to try anything.

14:04.943 --> 14:07.678
You sure it's all right?
Easy, easy, easy.

14:07.679 --> 14:10.981
Easy, boy. Oh, oh.

14:10.982 --> 14:13.317
Why are you looking at me
like that? Stop crying.

14:13.318 --> 14:15.052
Just a little bit.
Won't hurt.

14:15.053 --> 14:16.687
Right here.
Mm-hmm.

14:16.688 --> 14:18.656
<i>(stops crying)</i>

14:18.657 --> 14:21.058
Huh?
It worked.

14:21.059 --> 14:23.560
So that's what you look like
when you're not crying, huh?

14:23.561 --> 14:26.530
Oh, ho-ho-ho. He is
a handsome little fella.

14:26.531 --> 14:29.833
Hey. Thanks very much.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.670
When I first got married,
didn't think I ever wanted kids.

14:32.671 --> 14:34.137
Now that it happened...

14:34.138 --> 14:37.040
<i>(under his breath)</i>
...I like 'em better than cars.

14:37.041 --> 14:38.275
You got kids?

14:38.276 --> 14:41.379
I don't even have a car.

14:41.380 --> 14:47.251
Um, thanks for the belly rub.
I'll put him to bed now.

14:47.252 --> 14:49.353
Feel free to stop by
anytime and chat.

14:49.354 --> 14:51.388
Well, thanks, but
I'm a pretty private guy.

14:51.389 --> 14:53.991
I don't like sharing my problems
with other guys, ok?

14:53.992 --> 14:55.793
Good night.
Good night.

14:58.864 --> 15:00.931
That was the first time
since randy was born

15:00.932 --> 15:03.668
We got more than
two hours of sleep.

15:03.669 --> 15:06.804
That's two hours more
than I got last night.

15:06.805 --> 15:10.607
Kept thinking about
how nothing bad has ever
happened to this family.

15:10.608 --> 15:13.077
Been so lucky.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.878
Do you realize

15:14.879 --> 15:19.383
That tim has survived
over 200 accidents?

15:19.384 --> 15:24.087
Really? I would've thought
that number was much higher.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.460
Oh, god.

15:29.461 --> 15:33.730
I feel so helpless
just waiting for the phone
to ring.

15:33.731 --> 15:37.234
It is so frightening
to think how one phone call

15:37.235 --> 15:40.637
Can change your life forever.

15:40.638 --> 15:43.907
It's like our family's
been living in a big bubble
all these years,

15:43.908 --> 15:47.111
Protecting us
from anything bad
that could happen.

15:47.112 --> 15:51.349
Just one phone call,
one split second,

15:51.350 --> 15:53.183
The bubble could burst.

16:00.158 --> 16:03.460
I wondered if you have
randy's test results
back yet.

16:05.530 --> 16:09.566
It might be three or four
more hours? I'll hold.

16:11.870 --> 16:15.339
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I understand. Bye.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.007
Hi, mom.
Hi.

16:17.008 --> 16:18.876
Where's randy?

16:18.877 --> 16:22.146
I don't know. He said
he'd meet me after school,
but he never showed up.

16:23.014 --> 16:25.349
Tim, we have a problem.

16:25.350 --> 16:28.318
Did you talk to the doctor?
No, not yet.

16:28.319 --> 16:30.755
Randy didn't come home
from school.

16:30.756 --> 16:31.989
Ooh, boy.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.691
So what do we do?

16:33.692 --> 16:36.394
Don't worry about it.
You call around.
I'll drive around.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.962
I think I have a good idea
where he might be, ok?
Don't worry, please?

16:38.963 --> 16:40.631
Ok.

16:43.501 --> 16:47.404

16:58.950 --> 17:02.519
We don't have a milkman.

you're talking about.

17:05.423 --> 17:10.594
Al, I can't talk right now.
I'll see ya later. Bye.

17:22.607 --> 17:24.809
Hey, randy.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.544
What are you doing here?
Lookin' for you.

17:27.545 --> 17:29.546
Your mom and I
are worried about you.

17:29.547 --> 17:31.782
You know better than
to take off without telling us
where you're going.

17:31.783 --> 17:34.718
Then we're even.
What do you mean?

17:34.719 --> 17:37.454
Couple little things
you didn't tell me,
either, dad.

17:37.455 --> 17:40.124
What are you talking about?

17:40.125 --> 17:42.960
Like I might have cancer.

17:42.961 --> 17:47.164
Whoa, whoa. Where did you
get that information?

17:47.165 --> 17:49.333
Off the computer
at school.

17:49.334 --> 17:53.570
Said that sometimes
these kind of lumps
can be malignant.

17:53.571 --> 17:58.242
Randy, look, the chances
of this lump being malignant
are next to nothing.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.011
How could you not
tell me about this?

18:01.012 --> 18:03.047
'cause we didn't want you
freakin' out, ok?

18:03.048 --> 18:06.316
So I read it on a computer
sitting in the school library
all by myself?

18:06.317 --> 18:09.753
Hey, your mom and I,
that's the last thing
we wanted you to do.

18:09.754 --> 18:13.090
We're really sorry about that,
and she will be, too, ok?

18:13.091 --> 18:16.026
Why does this bad stuff
always have to happen to me?

18:16.027 --> 18:20.931
Bad stuff happens to everybody.
Bad stuff happens to me
all the time.

18:20.932 --> 18:23.300
Yeah, but you cause it.

18:32.844 --> 18:35.679
I know you're scared.
I know how you feel.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.448
No, you don't.

18:40.585 --> 18:43.154
I don't wanna die, dad.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.055
Come on, man,
you're not gonna die.

18:45.056 --> 18:47.892
Even if you had cancer,
which you don't,
you do not have that,

18:47.893 --> 18:50.761
It's a treatable kind, ok?

18:50.762 --> 18:53.497
Huh?

18:54.332 --> 18:57.234
Hmm? Hey, come on,
come on.

18:58.803 --> 19:00.871
We'll beat this thing,
no matter what it is, you know.

19:00.872 --> 19:03.040

happen to you.

19:10.615 --> 19:12.983
I'm sure that
they're gonna call
any minute.

19:12.984 --> 19:14.985
Oh, honey, come on.
Just play. Play.

19:14.986 --> 19:18.188

You gave me an opening, honey.
Read it and weep.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.516
"ex-lacks."

19:50.688 --> 19:53.290
What?

19:53.291 --> 19:55.793
Well, dad, first of all,
that's a brand name.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.628
And you didn't
spell it correctly.

The pill.

Well, ok, it's just
a pill every day.
