00:02.280 --> 00:03.360
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.600 --> 00:07.241
This city needs someone to stand up
who isn't hiding behind a mask.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.760
It needs a leader.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.888
<i>So, I've decided to run for mayor.</i>

00:11.080 --> 00:12.605
<i>Ollie, this is Alex Davis,</i>

00:12.840 --> 00:15.446
the new political strategist
that Walter recommended.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.407
<i>At the hospital, I looked Sara
in the eyes. She wasn't there.</i>

00:18.600 --> 00:21.126
And I'm the one who killed her
in the first place.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.521
<i>That's why she's after me, you know.</i>

00:23.720 --> 00:25.927
<i>This bloodlust she's consumed by,</i>

00:26.120 --> 00:29.283
<i>it's the same pain I feel
when I think about Ra's.</i>

00:29.440 --> 00:32.091
She kills me, she'll be okay.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.521
<i>There's more to the recording.
Something overlapping with it.</i>

00:34.760 --> 00:39.129
<i>What I need you to know is
I'm alive and I'm in trouble.</i>

00:42.160 --> 00:45.721
Open new file. ATOM project, update gamma.

00:46.120 --> 00:49.567
This will be
miniaturization test number one.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.291
Execute.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.645
Why can't anything ever work
at the first try? Hmm?

01:08.480 --> 01:11.404
All right, guys, I know it's been
a long haul figuring out your platform,

01:11.600 --> 01:13.568
but the good news is, we're almost done.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.926
Just two more things here on the docket.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.849
Mmm, actually, only one.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.606
I figured out where we're going to
hold Ollie's, uh, fundraiser.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.086
It's going to be at Gerard's.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.681
From what I remember,
that place is a little pricey,

01:23.920 --> 01:25.922
leading us to
our last talking point, the budget.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.167
- You have it, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.322
If by "you," you mean Felicity, then, yes.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.648
She was supposed to be here,
but she's just

01:31.840 --> 01:33.524
been slammed at Palmer Tech
for the past few days.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.682
She's really taking
this whole CEO thing seriously.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.491
Well, one of us has to have a job
that actually makes money.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.530
I'll speak with her,
I'll get those numbers for you.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.047
Alex, thank you so much
for all your hard work.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.124
I'll see you later.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.522
I was thinking, maybe we should
check out Gerard's tomorrow night.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.685
You know, just to make sure
it's the right type of venue

01:52.960 --> 01:54.610
for introducing our candidate.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.520
Are you asking me out on a date?

01:59.320 --> 02:02.722
To be honest,
it's been so long, I don't even know.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.570
I just am...
My life is really complicated right now,

02:07.800 --> 02:10.167
and I don't think going on a date
with my brother's campaign manager

02:10.400 --> 02:11.561
is going to make it any easier.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.883
No, you're right.
That was, uh, totally unprofessional,

02:15.040 --> 02:16.963
something I would normally never do.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.562
I just thought there was something there.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.847
Probably just consumed

02:21.000 --> 02:22.240
a little too much MSG.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.409
How about we just erase
these last five minutes?

02:24.560 --> 02:26.050
Absolutely not.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.730
It was nice.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.526
I'll see you later.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.925
<i>I'm alive</i>

02:41.080 --> 02:42.889
and I'm in trouble.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.924
<i>I'm alive</i>

02:46.080 --> 02:47.411
<i>and I'm in trouble.</i>

02:49.000 --> 02:50.047
I'm alive...

02:50.240 --> 02:53.767
I thought I said you could use my lab
if you clean up after yourself.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.843
The keyword being "after,"
which assumes finished,

02:56.040 --> 02:58.407
which clearly, I am not.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.926
Well, how's it going?

03:00.520 --> 03:01.567
<i>And I'm in trouble.</i>

03:01.760 --> 03:03.364
That well?

03:03.560 --> 03:04.607
I'm alive...

03:04.760 --> 03:05.921
Do you have that playing on a loop?

03:06.120 --> 03:08.441
I've been trying to trace to Ray's message
back to its point of origin,

03:08.600 --> 03:10.568
but he must have ping-ponged it
off of like a thousand servers,

03:10.760 --> 03:12.125
and the back-trace algorithm
won't compile,

03:12.280 --> 03:13.964
which means
there's no way of finding him, and...

03:14.200 --> 03:15.964
Okay! You need to stop right now.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.201
- I can't.
- You have to.

03:17.360 --> 03:20.091
You are no good to Mr. Palmer
in your current state.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.964
Now, how long has it been
since you took a break?

03:22.120 --> 03:24.441
I dozed off for about two minutes
about an hour ago, does that count?

03:27.280 --> 03:29.647
You're married, he's straight,
you're married, he's straight.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.961
Hi.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.804
Ah, perfect! Oliver Queen,
Curtis Holt. Curtis, Oliver.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.644
Curtis! Felicity's told me
a lot about you.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.564
She's told me virtually nothing about you.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.966
Okay.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.646
Curtis?

03:41.800 --> 03:42.881
What you doing?

03:43.080 --> 03:44.445
The Green Arrow showed up

03:44.640 --> 03:47.166
right about the time
that you came back into town.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.887
Nah, it's not you, though.
Jaw's not right.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.290
That's what I keep telling people.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.481
Would you give us a minute?

03:54.720 --> 03:56.085
Sure thing. Uh, nice meeting you.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.486
Nice meeting you, too.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.483
Hi.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.005
I thought that you were going to come by

04:02.160 --> 04:03.764
the campaign offices
to go over the finances.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.007
I thought that meeting was on Wednesday.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.400
It is Wednesday.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.284
- Oh.
- What's going on?

04:10.320 --> 04:11.651
<i>I'm alive</i>

04:12.120 --> 04:13.326
<i>and I'm in trouble.</i>

04:13.840 --> 04:16.081
- That sounds like...
- Ray. Because it is Ray,

04:16.279 --> 04:17.850
- because Ray isn't dead.
- What?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.081
That's impossible. Ray was...

04:19.240 --> 04:20.844
Killed. In an explosion
that blew off the top

04:21.000 --> 04:22.081
of this building six months ago.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.770
But that's obviously not what happened,

04:23.960 --> 04:25.485
because he sent this message six days ago,

04:25.680 --> 04:27.364
and dead people don't generally do that.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.524
Ray's alive. He's out there somewhere.
I have to help him.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.522
Why didn't you ever tell us
about this place before?

04:38.680 --> 04:40.205
I didn't know it was here.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.044
But it sort of seems like you did.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.601
I know this island
isn't all that it seems.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.481
You've done well, Mr. Queen.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.290
He let the British guy get away.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.209
Whoa, wait. Reiter.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.563
Constantine said
that there was some sort of

04:54.120 --> 04:56.851
barrier, like magic.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.562
I have no interest in the chamber.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.326
What is that?

05:08.720 --> 05:11.007
A message from the ancients,

05:11.240 --> 05:13.891
leading to a very special gift.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.927
"A heart of water."

05:19.720 --> 05:22.690
Have you seen a cove on the island?
Surrounded by mountains?

05:22.920 --> 05:23.921
Yeah, I know of one.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.242
I want you to go to that point
and lead an excavation.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.925
Take a dozen of the laborers and work them
until you find my gift.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.890
Can I talk to you for a sec?

05:38.240 --> 05:39.446
All right, first,

05:39.680 --> 05:42.081
what aren't you telling me
about what we're doing here?

05:42.240 --> 05:44.447
I mean, apart from everything.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.767
And second?

05:45.920 --> 05:48.082
Queen is a mole.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.760
Don't start trusting him just 'cause
he gave you a piece of bling.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.602
Accompany Mr. Queen to the cove.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.440
I know.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.966
I know.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.049
I love you, too, Mom.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.611
I love you so much.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.880
<i>Okay, bye, Mom.</i>

06:18.080 --> 06:20.082
How did that go?

06:20.400 --> 06:22.482
Easier than the last time
Mom found out

06:22.720 --> 06:24.324
that I wasn't dead.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.963
Hey.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.127
You okay, honey?

06:29.320 --> 06:30.401
<i>"SARA". Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

06:30.560 --> 06:32.608
It was just something Mom said

06:32.800 --> 06:36.327
about how I got lost when I was
walking home from school once, and...

06:36.800 --> 06:39.485
And how I promised
that I'd always come back.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.970
But I can't remember.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.650
You're probably better off not remembering

06:44.840 --> 06:47.320
all the messed up things
our parents did to us, anyway.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.404
Hey, you two turned out perfectly,
all right?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.250
<i>And more importantly, you're both home.</i>

06:51.440 --> 06:53.408
I couldn't ask for anything more.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.525
I tell you Ray's in trouble,
and your first response is,

06:58.680 --> 06:59.966
"You need a shower."

07:00.320 --> 07:01.526
And a nap.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.603
- You're not going to be able to help...
- Oh, stop!

07:03.800 --> 07:04.847
You're starting to sound like Curtis.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.968
Well, Curtis is a smart guy.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.082
Did Ray's message indicate
what kind of trouble he's in?

07:10.320 --> 07:12.482
If it did, it would have been
the first thing I told you.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.524
Okay. ls there anything
that I can do to help?

07:16.120 --> 07:18.851
Well, have you magically learned to code
in the last 72 hours?

07:19.040 --> 07:20.644
- No.
- That was a rhetorical question.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.126
I know.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.884
I will, however,
accept your undying support and backrub.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.441
You can have both as soon as you...

07:33.680 --> 07:36.365
- Shower.
- And take a nap.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.846
Come on.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.530
Come on, come on.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.207
What?

07:43.400 --> 07:44.890
I set an alertjust in case
the back-trace program

07:45.120 --> 07:46.565
ever finished compiling.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.051
- Felicity...
- Two seconds!

07:49.320 --> 07:51.322
It's been taking forever.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.526
<i>What are you doing?</i>

07:55.880 --> 07:57.245
Absolutely nothing.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.721
<i>Felicity, Felicity, is that you?</i>

08:02.000 --> 08:03.729
- Oh, my God, Ray!
- Ray, where are you?

08:03.920 --> 08:04.921
<i>I don't know.</i>

08:05.080 --> 08:07.401
<i>And if that wasn't enough,
I think I'm being held against my will.</i>

08:07.560 --> 08:08.641
What?

08:08.840 --> 08:10.046
<i>They want my suit, or at least the tech.</i>

08:10.240 --> 08:12.925
<i>The only good news is, the tech is
useless to them in my current condition.</i>

08:13.080 --> 08:15.208
Ray, if you have your suit,
then why don't you just, uh...

08:15.400 --> 08:17.767
<i>Bust my way out?
Yeah, that's not really happening.</i>

08:17.920 --> 08:18.921
What, the suit doesn't work?

08:19.080 --> 08:21.401
<i>Actually, it worked a little too well.</i>

08:36.880 --> 08:39.201
<i>They want my suit, or at least the tech.</i>

08:39.400 --> 08:42.210
<i>The only good news is, the tech is
useless to them in my current condition.</i>

08:42.720 --> 08:44.768
- John is never going to believe this.
- Neither is Thea.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.201
And, well, Ray is...

08:46.400 --> 08:48.289
The size of a tater tot.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.807
Ray modified his suit with
the same nanites I injected into him

08:50.960 --> 08:51.961
after Bad Arrow shot him.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.441
It's a long story
involving a lot of molecular physics.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.968
The bottom line is that Ray
jury-rigged a short-range message burst

08:58.120 --> 09:00.282
that was intercepted
by whoever's holding him captive.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.442
Ray thinks they want the suit
for its technology,

09:02.640 --> 09:03.766
but they can't use it while it's small.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.291
And while he's small, it's like

09:05.560 --> 09:07.608
looking for a needle
in a city of haystacks.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.564
Ray has something he thinks could help.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.130
<i>Back at Palmer Tech,
I've got schematics for a machine</i>

09:12.400 --> 09:13.640
<i>that should be able to resize me.</i>

09:15.640 --> 09:16.721
Well, now that you're both filled in...

09:16.920 --> 09:17.967
Where are you going?

09:18.160 --> 09:19.969
To Palmer Tech, to pull up
the schematics for Ray's device.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.480
I'll come with you.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.291
Why? Are you going to build the thing?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.000
No.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.240
There must be some other way I can help.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.646
There isn't.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.571
This isn't over, you know.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.165
You and me.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.845
I'm so glad.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.807
We need to get
a couple people in the water.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.128
Dive down, see what you can find.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.011
Everyone is tired.
We've been here for hours.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.840
If you want them to work,
they have to be able to.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.806
You their leader?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.686
I'm the guy telling you to let them rest.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.684
Okay.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.171
You brought food.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.682
Take 15 minutes and eat.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.122
Well, ain't you employer of the month.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.687
I'm going to need you
to keep an eye on them,

10:12.960 --> 10:15.361
and I'm going to go
enjoy my lunch in peace.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.211
Hey, Ukraine.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.280
My name is Vlad.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.041
Well, Vlad,

10:31.560 --> 10:33.528
how'd you like
your life to get a little better?

10:36.520 --> 10:38.522
Dr. Palmer got miniaturization to work.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.484
He made the space between atoms shrink.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.729
I mean, this is like solving cold fusion
and ultimate theory.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.803
- Do you have any idea how amazing this is?
- Yes.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.690
But the fact
that Ray is being held hostage

10:47.880 --> 10:50.087
and could be killed at any moment
because he is the size of a Cheeto

10:50.240 --> 10:52.402
has dampened my enthusiasm somewhat.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.050
- Can you build this?
- Yes.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.005
Uh, all the materials are here
at Palmer Tech, uh,

10:57.200 --> 10:58.406
<i>except for that.</i>

10:59.240 --> 11:00.765
That is a quantum manifold.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.251
Never heard of it. Where do we get one?

11:02.480 --> 11:04.050
Only one place. The manufacturer.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.607
They hold the patent on it...
Well, actually, 16 patents.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.250
- Curtis. Where?
- Kord Industries.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.443
I'd ask them to do us a solid
and loan it to us, but...

11:10.680 --> 11:11.841
They're our biggest competitor.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.441
The good news is,
things can't get any worse.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.206
You just had to go and say that.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.445
There you are!

11:21.680 --> 11:24.843
Mom. on.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.365
Oh. What are you doing here?

11:30.560 --> 11:33.609
Well, I went to your office,
Miss CEO,

11:33.760 --> 11:35.967
and your assistant told me you'd be here.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.441
So... Here I am.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.524
Not here-here, Star City here.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.250
Well, Oliver told me

11:43.440 --> 11:45.249
that you've been working nonstop
this past month,

11:45.440 --> 11:47.442
- so I suggested a visit from your mom...
- Uh-huh.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.449
Is exactly what you needed,
and guess what?

11:49.640 --> 11:51.051
- What?
- He agreed.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.086
Oh.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.209
Hi. And who are you?

11:55.480 --> 11:57.448
- Oh.
- Hi. I'm Curtis Holt.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.483
- It is an absolute pleasure to meet you.
- Oh.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.042
I can see where Felicity got her, uh...

12:03.880 --> 12:05.120
Blonde hair.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.723
Well, she dyes it, actually.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.482
So, what do you want to do first?

12:11.720 --> 12:13.484
A trip to the mall, mani-pedi...

12:13.720 --> 12:15.643
You know what, you must be
exhausted from your flight.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.484
Why don't I get a car
to take you back to my place?

12:17.640 --> 12:20.166
A car? No, baby, I...
I came here to see you.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.004
I know! And you will.
It's just that, right now,

12:22.160 --> 12:23.844
Curtis and I are trying
to figure out how to build

12:24.080 --> 12:25.923
a very important piece of equipment,
or someone could die.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.128
- Die?
- Metaphorically speaking!

12:28.840 --> 12:31.002
You start constructing the machine,
and I will get you the manifold.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.526
But it's proprietary.
How are you going to do that?

12:32.680 --> 12:33.681
I'm not!

12:33.840 --> 12:34.921
Awesome.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.684
The Green Arrow's going to
be kicking some ass tonight.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.684
If I don't kick his first.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.127
- I thought it would be a good thing.
<i>- A good</i> thing?

12:43.360 --> 12:44.850
What on Earth made you agree to this?

12:45.080 --> 12:47.162
Well, you know, your morn doesn't really
take no for an answer.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.806
You've faced down Mirakuru soldiers
and the League of Assassins.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.446
Are you honestly telling me that
you couldn't say no to my mom?

12:52.640 --> 12:54.005
She said she missed you,
and then she texted me

12:54.200 --> 12:56.487
one of those emojis with the single tear.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.284
You have been texting with my mother?

12:58.480 --> 12:59.527
<i>How long has that been going on?</i>

12:59.760 --> 13:01.967
You guys think we can find
a better time to fight about this?

13:02.160 --> 13:04.891
John? I thought only
Oliver's line was open.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.451
Nope. Mine is open.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.727
- And mine.
- And mine.

13:07.880 --> 13:11.202
I don't remember there being
so much chatter on these missions.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.130
Are you okay?

13:14.720 --> 13:15.721
Yeah.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.564
I need a little normal.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.850
And for me, this is
the kind of thing that passes.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.166
<i>I hacked the security panel,</i>

13:22.400 --> 13:23.890
but it needs
to be accessed from the inside.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.724
Only problem is,
is that the building's interior

13:25.960 --> 13:27.166
is protected
by pressure sensitive flooring,

13:27.360 --> 13:29.249
which means Chatty Cathy, you're up.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.323
- Chatty Cathy?
- Your new code name.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.090
The only one appropriate
enough I could think of

13:33.240 --> 13:34.526
to use in polite company.

13:34.720 --> 13:35.881
<i>Once the loading dock's doors are open,</i>

13:36.080 --> 13:37.411
<i>you'll have 90 seconds
to find the manifold</i>

13:37.560 --> 13:39.369
and amscray before men with guns show up.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.567
Chatty Cathy?

13:40.720 --> 13:44.008
You know, when I get back,

13:44.200 --> 13:46.089
you and I are going to have a talk.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.889
- I'm at the panel.
- Stand by.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.570
Punch in 4-5-8-7.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.249
<i>The clock's running.</i>

14:08.680 --> 14:10.091
You sure it was a good idea
to bring Sara along?

14:10.360 --> 14:11.600
She'll be fine.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.127
Something's wrong.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.770
The security cameras
are coming back online.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.280
I've got it.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.121
No, don't you understand?

14:22.360 --> 14:23.441
If Kord upgraded their security,

14:23.600 --> 14:25.284
they probably improved
their response time.

14:32.640 --> 14:33.880
Wait, I think this is it.

14:49.920 --> 14:50.967
Sara, stop!

14:51.240 --> 14:52.480
Sara!

14:54.960 --> 14:56.291
Sara!

15:01.280 --> 15:02.770
We have to go.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.005
We're clear.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.482
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

15:19.680 --> 15:21.682
- Ray...
<i>- Any luck with the schematics?</i>

15:22.160 --> 15:24.288
<i>I realize the quantum manifold
could present a challenge.</i>

15:24.680 --> 15:27.331
Nothing a little late night shopping
at Kord Industries couldn't solve.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.005
Oh, that's great. Thank you, Felicity.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.442
Now we just have to figure out how...

15:32.360 --> 15:33.600
Ray, you still there?

15:41.440 --> 15:42.680
Oh, no.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.888
What happened out there?

15:49.120 --> 15:51.043
Sara, she, um,

15:51.200 --> 15:52.725
had a moment with the security guard.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.370
Laurel and Thea took her home.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.041
Are you sure it was Darhk
that you saw on Ray's camera?

15:57.280 --> 15:59.362
Just as sure as I am
that Ray is not getting out of this!

15:59.560 --> 16:00.846
It's actually good that Darhk has Ray.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.041
This would be the same level of delusion

16:02.280 --> 16:04.806
that made you think my mother coming
to town would make me feel better?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.411
Because it's Darhk,

16:06.560 --> 16:07.891
that means that we have an asset.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.849
- Lance.
- I'll ask him to get us a location.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.121
And what if between then and now,

16:11.360 --> 16:13.567
Darhk decides to squish Ray
underneath his shoe?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.484
If Darhk wanted to hurt Ray,
he would have done it by now.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.727
Dig's right. We stay focused.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.691
We get Curtis the manifold,
keep him working,

16:19.880 --> 16:22.850
and we unfortunately just have to
wait and see what Lance finds out.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.003
I hate waiting and seeing.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.247
I have to do something.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.244
Your mother's in town,
spend some time with her.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.641
We could do dinner. I'll cook.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.688
You already made dinner plans
with my mother, didn't you?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.365
What? No.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.240
- Yes.
- Oh!

16:39.480 --> 16:41.323
Oh, my God!
It is like a sickness with you!

16:41.680 --> 16:43.409
It wasn't intentional.
We were having a nice conversation,

16:43.680 --> 16:45.045
the subject turned to cooking,

16:45.240 --> 16:48.050
I mentioned that I make
a spectacular chicken cordon bleu.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.605
<i>She said she'd never had one.</i>

16:49.840 --> 16:51.205
It's just dinner.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.920
He's right, Felicity.
Besides, you look like you haven't

16:54.080 --> 16:55.764
eaten or slept.

16:56.720 --> 17:01.089
A man's life, a friend's life
is in danger.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.602
Doesn't seem like
the right time for cordon bleu.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.441
I promise you that
there is nothing that we can do

17:07.599 --> 17:10.604
until we get what we need
from Lance and Curtis.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.371
So, dinner.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.046
7:00 p.m. I'll be there
as soon as I'm done with Lance.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.960
Nice instincts.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.809
I wasn't sure you were coming back.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.803
Well...

17:39.960 --> 17:41.803
I said that I would.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.291
I guess it's no surprise to you,

17:47.480 --> 17:50.848
but I have lost faith in people doing
what they said they're going to do.

17:51.920 --> 17:56.244
Do you notice Reiter interested
in anything other than the camp or drugs?

17:56.440 --> 17:57.601
Yeah.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.491
He also enjoys
stealing people away from their families.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.609
Have you seen him do anything, uh,

18:02.800 --> 18:04.802
mystical, or even...

18:06.240 --> 18:07.605
Magical?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.641
He always has been a little odd.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.080
And very religious.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.967
He's even blessed some of the prisoners.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.686
Claims he's healed their souls
or some craziness.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.526
I'm beginning to think
that drugs are just a front

18:20.680 --> 18:21.966
for what he's really doing here.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.680
What could be more tempting
to a man like him than money?

18:26.120 --> 18:27.360
Power.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.205
I can't stay long.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.886
I can't have Conklin
being any more suspicious of me

18:32.120 --> 18:33.201
than he already is,

18:33.440 --> 18:35.010
but you still need to stay here.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.804
I'll come back as much as I can.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.282
This time, I believe you.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.650
<i>I thought it was
past time that we met.</i>

18:47.840 --> 18:51.845
My engineers have had no success
in restoring you to your proper size,

18:52.040 --> 18:54.361
so I thought I'd appeal
to your cooperation.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.483
And what do I get if I help you out?

18:56.680 --> 18:57.886
Apart from, probably, death?

18:58.120 --> 18:59.406
No.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.007
I don't think it's your life
you should be worried about.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.082
<i>I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault.</i>

19:10.320 --> 19:12.402
And who is this Felicity, I wonder.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.849
Certainly not your former vice president,
current CEO, girlfriend.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.207
<i>Don't you touch her.</i>

19:17.400 --> 19:19.926
Don't make empty threats.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.491
It's

19:22.080 --> 19:23.241
small.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.606
<i>Oh, and by the way,</i>

19:24.840 --> 19:27.081
we weren't listening for a distress call
from a dead man.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.687
It was pure luck, really,
that we intercepted your message.

19:29.880 --> 19:34.568
But isn't luck
just another word for destiny?

19:44.520 --> 19:45.760
Sorry I'm <i>late.</i>

19:46.600 --> 19:47.761
I tried following the recipe...

19:47.920 --> 19:49.763
You know, I think
your oven might be broken,

19:49.920 --> 19:51.763
because I was supposed
to put in for, like, 20 minutes,

19:51.960 --> 19:53.121
<i>and all of a sudden it just...</i>

19:53.280 --> 19:54.964
I don't know,
smoke just started billowing out,

19:55.200 --> 19:58.568
and I think the chicken's just a little,
slightly undercooked.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.609
I think the technical term is raw.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.291
It's... It's fine, it's fine.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.284
I'm home now. I'll whip something up.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.882
'Cause you just always fix everything.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.640
<i>"DONNA". A man who cooks.</i>

20:09.560 --> 20:10.641
Put a ring on that.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.882
How'd that very important
doctor's appointment go, hon?

20:13.120 --> 20:15.202
Uh... Good, yes.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.568
Dr. Lance is just going to

20:17.760 --> 20:20.809
find out where the pain is coming from.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.451
Pain? Are you okay, hon?

20:22.640 --> 20:26.042
Fine. I'm just trying to figure out
what I've done wrong.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.810
L...

20:34.000 --> 20:36.401
I'm going to go get some takeout.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.649
The best part about arguing
is the make-up sex.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.161
Okay.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.529
Inviting your mother for a surprise visit
wasn't the best idea.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.007
- Mmm.
- I totally accept that.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.686
What I'm not accepting, or understanding,

20:56.840 --> 20:58.171
is just you shutting me out.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.602
I am not shutting you out.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.171
I'm trying to focus on finding Ray,

21:02.440 --> 21:04.204
but I can't do that
with all of these distractions.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.363
Distractions? What is going on with you?

21:06.600 --> 21:08.329
You're acting like
it's my fault that Ray...

21:08.520 --> 21:10.010
It's my fault!

21:10.440 --> 21:11.851
What's happening with Ray,

21:12.520 --> 21:14.602
to Ray, is my fault.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.768
Felicity, it really isn't.

21:17.440 --> 21:21.047
Ray was sending distress calls
for weeks after the accident.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.121
I wasn't here to receive them

21:23.280 --> 21:25.806
because I was too busy
traveling the world with you.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.886
I took the police's word for it
that no body could be recovered

21:29.040 --> 21:32.362
because I was so swept up
in being with you.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.486
I'm sorry.

21:35.800 --> 21:39.361
It was my choice to uproot my entire life,

21:39.560 --> 21:43.042
leave my home and my job,
which turns out I am very good at.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.890
I lost myself in you,

21:47.040 --> 21:48.804
and I was never that girl.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.640
That girl who just loses herself in a guy.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.161
That is not who I am.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.800
This isn't about Ray.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.331
It's about us.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.846
No.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.686
Yes.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.565
I don't know.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.600
Okay.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.165
I'm going to give you some space
until you figure it out.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.966
It says the traffic cameras are online.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.044
Yeah, you got to give it
a minute to upload.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.770
What are you doing here, anyway?

22:49.960 --> 22:50.961
I thought I was waiting for Lance,

22:51.200 --> 22:53.646
and you were having dinner
with the Smoak ladies.

22:53.880 --> 22:54.961
Went that well, did it?

22:55.200 --> 22:57.123
Do you know what I miss
about our old space?

22:57.280 --> 23:00.443
That trunk, with the bottle
of Russian vodka in it.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.245
Vodka

23:05.960 --> 23:07.121
is for wimps, anyway.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.640
Vodka is for wimps?

23:09.040 --> 23:10.246
Tennessee whiskey.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.646
Put some hair on your chest.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.161
It is hard to imagine

23:14.320 --> 23:16.561
dinner with Felicity and her mother
not going well.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.765
<i>Donna's not the problem.</i>

23:22.960 --> 23:24.007
Lam.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.970
Felicity says that she's lost herself
in our relationship,

23:27.160 --> 23:28.969
which means
that she doesn't know who she is,

23:29.160 --> 23:33.085
and that if we hadn't left
Star City when we did,

23:33.440 --> 23:35.602
she would have been around to help Ray.

23:35.800 --> 23:39.168
Meta-humans, magic, resurrections...

23:39.320 --> 23:42.005
I thought I'd seen it all,
but Oliver Queen jealous?

23:42.160 --> 23:46.768
I'm not jealous. I just got to know
if Ivy Town was as good as it gets for us.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.446
Because we've come back here,

23:48.640 --> 23:51.086
everything has
just gotten super complicated,

23:51.320 --> 23:54.210
and it just makes me wonder,

23:54.440 --> 23:55.805
why did she choose me?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.048
Oliver, I've heard you say
a lot of crazy things over the years,

23:58.280 --> 24:00.282
- but that has to be the prize.
- You know what I mean.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.687
It takes me ten minutes
to log into this thing.

24:02.840 --> 24:06.367
Felicity does it in two seconds,
and Ray probably invented it.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.885
Yeah, you're probably right.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.849
Except, Felicity didn't choose Ray.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.486
She chose you.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.370
Sure, she has a lot in common with Ray,

24:14.960 --> 24:17.281
but sometimes what looks good on paper
isn't what works in real life.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.367
What if something happens to him?

24:21.120 --> 24:22.360
We don't get him back?

24:22.720 --> 24:24.529
Felicity Smoak

24:24.720 --> 24:27.564
is one of the smartest,
most badass women on the planet.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.646
She comes through this,
she'll get Ray back.

24:30.840 --> 24:31.887
You seem pretty sure.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.043
I married a woman just like that.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.242
Twice, Oliver. Twice.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.811
You did.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.004
Look, man, relationships
have their ups and downs.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.531
Sometimes, you just give her some time,

24:42.840 --> 24:45.571
a little bit of space.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.921
It's Lance.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.162
Meeting with Darhk in 20.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.240
You good?

24:55.520 --> 24:56.567
Better.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.080
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:06.680 --> 25:07.920
What the hell?

25:20.600 --> 25:21.681
Appreciate you meeting me.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.769
I know you're a busy man. lam.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.441
But I may have found a way
to make this city

25:26.680 --> 25:27.886
useful for once.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.764
- I don't understand.
- Oh, you will.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.689
Everyone in this city will.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.684
Well, maybe I could find out
sooner than others.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.963
My daughter, Sara, she's, uh...

25:36.120 --> 25:38.122
She's back, but, you know,
not all the way, you know?

25:38.360 --> 25:40.362
Something about her is...
ls still a little off.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.967
I assure you, the relevance escapes me.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.090
Well, I was thinking maybe
if I could help you a little more,

25:46.240 --> 25:47.287
then maybe you could help me.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.482
You know your way around
this magic mumbo jumbo.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.120
Mumbojumbo?

25:54.640 --> 25:55.926
I'll consider it, Captain,

25:56.720 --> 25:59.405
but this will be the last time
you summon me.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.846
John, he just left.
He's headed south down Victoria Street.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.560
Copy that. I've got eyes on.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.166
FELICITYI Yeah?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.000
I brought you some hot milk.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.287
I'm not 10, Mom.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.010
I'll bring it back downstairs.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.526
No, wait, wait, wait.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.609
Since you went to all the trouble.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.164
Do you remember
when you were a little girl

26:40.360 --> 26:42.806
and I told you
you couldn't go to Space Camp?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.207
You locked yourself
in your room for two days.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.204
To be fair, it was Space Camp.

26:47.440 --> 26:51.650
But I told you I couldn't bear the thought
of sending you away for eight weeks.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.520
The truth was, hon, I...

26:58.440 --> 26:59.851
I couldn't afford it.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.371
Then why didn't you just tell me that?

27:01.640 --> 27:05.565
Because I was embarrassed,
you know, that I had no money,

27:05.800 --> 27:07.290
that I had no idea where your father was,

27:07.520 --> 27:10.888
and even if I did, he never paid a dime
in child support, anyway.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.885
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.724
I put everything into your father.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.122
My love, my trust, my twenties.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.850
My point is, you are not me.

27:23.880 --> 27:27.327
You are the CEO
of a bajillion dollar company.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.843
And Oliver,
he's not like your father, hon.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.320
He loves you.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.321
No one has ever looked at me
the way he looks at you.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.362
He's wonderful.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.324
In a million different ways.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.405
But that's the problem.

27:43.880 --> 27:47.327
It's too easy to lose myself in him.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.250
Baby-

27:50.520 --> 27:54.161
That's how it's supposed to feel
when you love someone.

27:55.560 --> 27:58.086
Believe it or not,
he's lost himself in you.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.771
And you'll find yourself

28:02.000 --> 28:03.286
in each other.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.762
Just don't get in your own way.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.128
And don't ruin something

28:08.360 --> 28:10.283
that most people never get.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.680
'Cause if you do,

28:11.880 --> 28:15.202
trust me, you'll never find another
guy that hot again who cooks.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.451
Thanks.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.124
He is definitely hiding
something in there.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.203
Latin Building.
Before the city went to crap,

28:35.440 --> 28:38.125
it was touted as the most secure building
on the west coast.

28:38.320 --> 28:41.483
Every access point is protected
by a retinal scanner and a voice print.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.131
There is no way we're getting in there.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.731
Not from the outside, at least.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.649
How's Curtis doing on the resizing device?

28:46.800 --> 28:48.404
He said he could have
something functional in an hour.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.607
I don't think we have that kind of time.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.330
He's going to have to
assemble it in the field.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.811
Wait, with us?

28:53.760 --> 28:55.808
Are we sure we want
to have your assistant in on this?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.320
He's my employee, actually.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.245
And I'm not sure our company health plan
covers supernatural dismemberment.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.171
We need him. And if Curtis
can resize Ray on the inside,

29:03.400 --> 29:05.164
then we have another hand
getting us all outside.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.000
Then how about one more?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.411
I don't think that's a good idea.

29:11.640 --> 29:14.166
Laurel, I don't know
what's going on with me,

29:14.320 --> 29:16.687
but I need to know
that I can control this.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.680
Suit up.

30:07.320 --> 30:08.560
Hmm.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.086
These are very nice.

30:15.680 --> 30:16.886
Oops.

30:19.560 --> 30:20.800
Leave us.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.611
Package is delivered.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.887
Ready.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.208
- Felicity?
- Ready.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.851
Or as ready as I'll ever be.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.281
When I told HR I wanted
a little bit more excitement from my job,

30:49.520 --> 30:50.885
this really isn't what I had in mind.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.525
Look, you were the one who said
you wanted to help Ray

30:52.720 --> 30:54.006
and that you were
an accomplished BASE jumper.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.129
Oh, God, I really do
have too many hobbies.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.601
Well, all right, Spartan.
Let's do this.

30:58.840 --> 30:59.921
Spartan?

31:00.120 --> 31:02.361
We have a guest tonight.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.281
All right, disengaging security systems...

31:05.440 --> 31:07.408
Now.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.281
Whoo!

31:18.800 --> 31:20.290
You two okay?

31:20.640 --> 31:21.971
We're not dead.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.440
Good.

31:23.640 --> 31:24.880
Let's go.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.523
You mind if I take a little peek-see?

31:58.760 --> 32:01.001
I mean, I have my suspicions, of course,

32:01.440 --> 32:04.011
but I just want to see
if I'm right, as usual.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.362
Didn't you learn anything
from our last go-round?

32:17.600 --> 32:18.840
I guess not.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.326
Hey.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.721
How do you open this?

32:46.880 --> 32:49.042
<i>Yeah, my best guess is
it needs an asymmetric cipher.</i>

32:49.320 --> 32:51.402
<i>You can open it with five years
and an NSA-grade computer.</i>

32:51.560 --> 32:54.040
What if we enlarged him now,
and then use his size to break the cube?

32:54.360 --> 32:56.328
The quantum field won't be able
to penetrate this polymer.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.565
You know, it is a shame
that you won't live

33:04.720 --> 33:06.927
to see the new life
that I breathe into the city.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.927
The new life
that I breathe into this world.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.844
You won't get the chance.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.730
<i>They put these mini-cams in here with me,</i>

33:22.920 --> 33:25.082
- and <i>those</i> cameras...
- Need to draw power from somewhere.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.924
Ray, you are a genius.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.446
<i>"RAY". Well, I don't know about that,</i>

33:28.600 --> 33:31.683
<i>but I have siphoned off enough juice
to power up my exo-suit.</i>

33:34.760 --> 33:36.603
Dr. Palmer's doohickey's ready.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.605
If you don't mind
my use of the technical term.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.091
DO it!

33:47.760 --> 33:49.125
I'm not dead.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.121
<i>We've got Ray, let's go.</i>

33:55.280 --> 33:56.566
Copy that.

34:02.760 --> 34:03.966
Sara!

34:04.960 --> 34:06.246
No!

34:09.639 --> 34:11.802
Come on. We have to go!

34:11.960 --> 34:13.291
Come on!

34:18.440 --> 34:19.646
We have to move.

34:21.639 --> 34:22.926
Good to see you, Ray.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.639
Nice suit.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.485
The worst part wasn't being small.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.130
It was that everything else was so big.

34:35.320 --> 34:38.164
The explosion at Palmer Tech tossed me
into an abandoned construction site.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.163
The cockroaches
were the size of golden retrievers.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.447
I'm not exaggerating.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.330
Uh, I think we don't
need to know that, really.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.161
The entomologist in me
was actually really fascinated.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.005
I mean, you can't appreciate the size
of the mandibles until the...

34:49.159 --> 34:51.322
Mmm! Mmm-mmm. No. I've heard enough.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.522
I got a thing against cockroaches,
and snakes and spiders,

34:53.679 --> 34:56.159
but especially... cockroaches.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.286
Sorry, Ray, not everyone shares
your enthusiasm for bugs.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.528
But it is good to see
the experience didn't change you.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.205
Indeed. I got your medical tests back,

35:03.440 --> 35:06.205
and aside from
a very noticeable iron deficiency,

35:06.520 --> 35:07.681
all your results are positive.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.367
There don't seem to be any side effects
from the, um, micro-sizing.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.363
- Relieved to hear it.
- So are we.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.126
So, this guy who wanted
to make me his lab rat?

35:16.320 --> 35:17.367
Damien Darhk.

35:17.520 --> 35:21.127
He's the leader of an organization
we believe to be known as HIVE.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.368
Oh, like SPECTRE? That's so cool!

35:24.280 --> 35:25.327
And terrible.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.561
<i>Be assured, Palmer,</i>

35:26.720 --> 35:28.563
that if they wanted your tech,
it wasn't for any good reason.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.484
One other thing.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.170
They overheard my message to you.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.731
I'm a possible target. I figured.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.051
I wouldn't be doing this
if I couldn't handle

35:36.200 --> 35:39.044
being threatened by a super villain
every now and then.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.285
Come on. I'll take you home.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.050
I can catch you up on all the latest
at your company.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.770
Uh, actually,

35:45.080 --> 35:47.082
until I decide to come back from the dead,

35:47.240 --> 35:48.287
it's your company.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.720
Great.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.970
What in the hell?

36:15.960 --> 36:18.361
You better have a story
to go along with that body.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.362
Look, Thea told me
that this was a side effect of the Pit.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.609
And I thought that I could fight it.
I just...

36:31.800 --> 36:33.689
I couldn't stop myself.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.164
And the worst part of it was,
I felt better.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.328
Look, Sara, controlling this,

36:39.520 --> 36:42.091
it's not going to come easy, okay?

36:42.280 --> 36:43.441
<i>It's going to take you some time.</i>

36:43.680 --> 36:44.966
And how many bodies?

36:45.440 --> 36:48.808
Look, I respect the way that
you could deal with this, Thea,

36:49.000 --> 36:50.923
but I need to handle this
in a different way.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.360
Different how?

36:57.280 --> 37:00.011
Laurel, I owe you everything.

37:00.480 --> 37:04.530
And you gave me the greatest gift
that anyone ever could.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.723
You gave me a second chance,

37:07.440 --> 37:09.488
and the ability to start over.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.842
I think it's time that I really do that.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.565
But, Sara,

37:15.640 --> 37:16.801
we just got you back.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.690
Sara, you don't have to leave.

37:19.200 --> 37:23.000
I know it doesn't seem possible right now,

37:23.200 --> 37:24.850
but you can have a normal life.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.009
It's been a long time

37:27.200 --> 37:29.362
since my normal has ever been normal.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.011
Look, I'll go visit Mom in Central City,

37:33.200 --> 37:35.328
and then, somewhere...

37:35.560 --> 37:37.324
Maybe a few somewheres,

37:37.560 --> 37:39.369
just until I figure things out.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.648
If you're sure that
that's what you want to do.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.964
It's your life,

37:45.200 --> 37:46.929
and you have to do what makes you happy.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.890
I'm just really going to miss you.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.528
I love you, sis.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.564
Always and forever.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.244
I love you, too.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.406
Hey-

38:12.640 --> 38:13.880
Hi.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.127
How did it go with Ray?

38:15.280 --> 38:16.327
Fine.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.330
Until <i>I</i> told him <i>I</i> sold his condo.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.525
- I wanted...
- Before we...

38:23.720 --> 38:24.960
Uh, hmm.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.600
You go first.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.007
No.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.480
You.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.286
I think we should...

38:33.880 --> 38:35.166
Clear the air.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.360
Um...

38:43.160 --> 38:44.400
I wanted to thank you.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.521
For helping save Ray,
and for being so understanding

38:47.760 --> 38:50.240
in the midst of my mini...

38:50.440 --> 38:51.851
Gargantuan freak-out.

38:52.120 --> 38:55.203
Well, I'm sorry
that I'm not the best listener.

38:56.760 --> 38:59.366
But all Of this is just...

38:59.600 --> 39:00.931
It's kind of new to me.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.406
And to me.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.244
I didn't exactly grow up

39:04.480 --> 39:07.529
with the best example
of a normal, healthy relationship.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.768
Line forms behind me.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.326
It's kind of amazing
that we've made it this far.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.450
We're going to be fine.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.529
How can you be so sure?

39:19.320 --> 39:21.482
Because we found ourselves in each other.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.011
<i>Feeling lonely?</i>

39:51.680 --> 39:53.364
You don't even know the half of it.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.400
<i>I might.</i>

39:59.800 --> 40:01.086
I, um...

40:02.640 --> 40:07.202
I came to town to visit my daughter,
but she kicked me out of her apartment

40:07.880 --> 40:10.281
to finish a fight with the man I hope

40:10.480 --> 40:12.084
will become my future son-in-law.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.563
Okay, it's your turn.

40:17.880 --> 40:22.363
Well, one of my daughters is leaving town
after being back a whole five minutes.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.760
Sounds like a reason to drink.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.724
I always got a reason.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.251
But this is club soda.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.120
Quentin.

40:35.560 --> 40:36.800
Donna.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.049
Hey, Thea, when your brother comes in,

40:51.240 --> 40:52.446
could you have him sign these
for me, please?

40:52.600 --> 40:53.681
Yeah.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.001
You Okay?

40:55.200 --> 40:56.531
Just a little stressed out.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.568
Maybe, um...

40:59.760 --> 41:01.046
Maybe I need to get a drink.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.568
It's a little early for a cocktail, but...

41:03.760 --> 41:05.762
Not now. Later?

41:07.080 --> 41:09.651
With you, at Gerard's?

41:09.800 --> 41:10.847
But I thought you...

41:11.000 --> 41:12.729
I just want to have a normal life.

41:14.280 --> 41:15.441
Meet me there at 8:00?

41:15.640 --> 41:17.290
Yeah, absolutely. Uh...

41:20.200 --> 41:22.009
I'll leave these here.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.880
Dr. Palmer's molecular realignment

41:32.080 --> 41:34.242
was premised on a power draw
from our system, which resulted...

41:34.440 --> 41:37.125
Just because I understand science
doesn't mean I'm not bored by it.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.606
Bottom-line it for me.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.485
We were able to recover some residue
from Dr. Palmer's dwarf star alloy,

41:41.720 --> 41:43.802
and use it to fashion into a power source.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.240
Good.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.680
Test it out.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.491
On this.

42:27.680 --> 42:28.681
