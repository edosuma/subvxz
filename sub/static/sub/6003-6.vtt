00:04.944 --> 00:07.613
Keep your eyes steadily on the disc.

00:07.614 --> 00:10.949
But it's getting harder.

00:10.984 --> 00:14.853
Your eyes are so tired from staring.

00:14.854 --> 00:18.356
Your eyelids feel like lead.

00:18.357 --> 00:20.892
They want to close.

00:20.893 --> 00:25.130
Heavier. Heavier.

00:25.131 --> 00:27.899
You must close them...

00:27.900 --> 00:29.935
now.

00:33.039 --> 00:35.072
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:35.174 --> 00:38.309
these three people are
now in a state of hypnosis.

00:38.377 --> 00:41.979
Suggestions I make will
be implicitly accepted

00:42.014 --> 00:44.549
regardless of their nonsensical character.

00:52.324 --> 00:54.359
Archie.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.828
Archie, when you wake,

00:57.863 --> 01:01.265
there will be a kitten in front of you.

01:01.399 --> 01:05.770
There is nothing more frightening
in this world than this creature.

01:05.771 --> 01:08.538
You want nothing to do with it.

01:13.679 --> 01:15.712
No!

01:15.713 --> 01:17.613
No, get... no kitties!

01:17.614 --> 01:19.748
It's only a kitten.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.284
Get the cat out of here!

01:21.285 --> 01:23.753
Gonna kill us all! Get it out!

01:31.929 --> 01:33.963
They come from Siberia,

01:33.964 --> 01:37.332
a fierce and dangerous place.

01:37.366 --> 01:39.467
Their mother, when she was with child,

01:39.468 --> 01:41.870
was attacked by a bear.

01:41.905 --> 01:44.272
The girls, even in their mother's womb,

01:44.440 --> 01:48.043
instinctively knew that to survive
they should cling to one another.

01:48.044 --> 01:50.478
They held on so tight,

01:50.479 --> 01:53.581
and this was the result.

01:53.583 --> 01:55.784
The birth was so excruciating,

01:55.785 --> 01:58.086
it killed their mother.

01:58.154 --> 02:01.389
Their father died of
shock upon seeing them.

02:01.390 --> 02:05.059
Zoya and Nika were alone.

02:05.060 --> 02:07.194
But they proved in the womb

02:07.230 --> 02:09.830
their incredible survival ability.

02:09.832 --> 02:12.500
They lived off the milk of a goat

02:12.501 --> 02:15.069
and fallen acorns from a tree.

02:15.170 --> 02:19.473
They watched the wolves and
by the age of four could hunt.

02:19.475 --> 02:23.277
They taught themselves to speak, to sing,

02:23.346 --> 02:27.448
and even to play instruments
that they carved themselves.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074

02:49.671 --> 02:51.838
That's quite a story.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.840
I've recounted it 1,000 times

02:53.841 --> 02:55.841
and I still find it inspiring.

02:55.977 --> 02:59.345
How would you know that they
clung to each other in the womb?

02:59.346 --> 03:01.181
You telling me my business, mister?

03:01.182 --> 03:03.049
No, no, no. I meant no disrespect.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.218
I'm a doctor. I'm a natural skeptic.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.520
John Thackery. Knickerbocker Hospital.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.622
Lester Brockhurst.

03:09.791 --> 03:13.794
Mr. Brockhurst, would you be willing
to allow me to examine the girls?

03:13.795 --> 03:15.095
What for?

03:15.129 --> 03:18.531
Purely from a scientific perspective.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.533
When was the last time they saw a doctor?

03:20.634 --> 03:23.169
I got a physician's book.
I make sure they're healthy.

03:23.304 --> 03:26.606
No, of course. And it looks
like you're doing a fine job.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.642
One of them got dysentery
last year. I fixed her up.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.111
That's very impressive.

03:32.145 --> 03:35.014
So they don't share a digestive tract.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.718
It's not that I don't trust doctors,

03:38.719 --> 03:39.885
it's the time it takes.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.487
That's money out of my pocket.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.392
So, what would you say if I offered
to hire them for a private show?

03:48.495 --> 03:50.129
We'll need transportation

03:50.197 --> 03:53.699
and a meal afterwards for
me at a reputable place.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.535
That can definitely be arranged.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.236
I'll be in touch.

04:08.461 --> 04:12.568
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

04:32.704 --> 04:34.838
Morphine for the pain.

04:35.039 --> 04:39.143
The nurse will take you to another
room to rest for a couple of hours.

04:39.210 --> 04:42.546
The X-rays will have
been developed by then.

04:42.614 --> 04:45.282
I'll come in and check
on you and take you home.

05:00.499 --> 05:02.633
Do those help?

05:02.634 --> 05:05.202
A little.

05:05.303 --> 05:08.971
The key seems to be in coating
the zinc needles with mercury.

05:08.973 --> 05:10.540
And the amount of current needed

05:10.574 --> 05:12.242
for the zinc and mercury to ionize

05:12.277 --> 05:14.043
is dependent upon the size of the tumor.

05:14.279 --> 05:17.113
But if done correctly, the procedure
claims to kill all the malignant cells

05:17.148 --> 05:18.682
without disturbing the healthy tissue.

05:18.783 --> 05:21.551
It seems far less risky
than an all-out laryngectomy.

05:21.652 --> 05:24.221
I witnessed several of those
in Paris. They all failed.

05:24.255 --> 05:25.788
They couldn't reconstruct the windpipe

05:25.856 --> 05:28.391
after having removed so
much tissue with the tumor.

05:30.828 --> 05:33.330
I think it's worth trying.

05:33.331 --> 05:35.998
In the absence of any other solution, yes.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.367
But it's still experimental
and Zinberg would never...

05:38.469 --> 05:41.971
I don't have the luxury of
two years' worth of study.

05:41.972 --> 05:44.207
So I was hoping you'd help me.

05:45.342 --> 05:47.409
You have experience working in secret.

05:48.979 --> 05:51.180
I'm sorry.

05:51.181 --> 05:54.416
I just meant I need someone I can trust.

05:54.485 --> 05:57.553
Harold. Harold. Just tell Croker

05:57.588 --> 06:00.422
he'll have the last 100,000 by Tuesday.

06:01.459 --> 06:03.092
Right.

06:03.193 --> 06:06.462
And listen, Harold. Where are
we with the Brooklyn lines?

06:06.497 --> 06:08.197
'Cause I don't want to open the paper

06:08.198 --> 06:10.233
and find they've all been auctioned off.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.471
Uh-huh.

06:15.472 --> 06:17.606
Right.

06:17.607 --> 06:19.275
That's fine.

06:19.309 --> 06:22.144
Just keep me apprised of the situation.

06:22.179 --> 06:24.680
All right, I have to go, Prettyman.

06:24.681 --> 06:26.282
Good-bye.

06:28.118 --> 06:30.019
Nurse Elkins.

06:30.020 --> 06:33.689
What are you...

06:35.359 --> 06:37.225
I've been watching some of the other girls

06:37.361 --> 06:40.695
receive invitations to the
fundraising ball from their suitors.

06:43.366 --> 06:45.400
I was wondering when I was gonna get mine.

06:48.971 --> 06:52.640
How many other girls
do I have to watch smile

06:52.674 --> 06:56.011
holding an invitation before I get one?

06:56.012 --> 06:58.379
I...

07:01.083 --> 07:03.884
Usually you have so many
clever things to say.

07:05.186 --> 07:07.554
What's the matter?

07:08.590 --> 07:10.391
People can see.

07:10.392 --> 07:12.159
The glass.

07:12.193 --> 07:14.962
Doesn't bother me. Does it bother you?

07:18.066 --> 07:20.768
Maybe I should stop so you
can gather your thoughts.

07:20.769 --> 07:23.738
No.

07:23.739 --> 07:27.741
Well, then, my invitation?

07:28.943 --> 07:30.777
Soon.

07:30.778 --> 07:33.380
Very soon.

07:36.518 --> 07:38.318
Good.

07:45.293 --> 07:48.128
And this is the big top

07:48.129 --> 07:50.563
at the center of our circus.

07:52.232 --> 07:54.299
How full does your gallery get?

07:54.301 --> 07:56.802
When Thackery was leading the operations,

07:56.803 --> 07:59.271
standing room only.

07:59.273 --> 08:03.542
Not what yours is, is it, Russell?

08:05.279 --> 08:09.348
Well, we don't have the suction machine

08:09.383 --> 08:11.616
or any of the other electric gadgets.

08:11.618 --> 08:13.118
Lighting is better in here, too.

08:13.119 --> 08:15.187
Mm-hmm.

08:15.221 --> 08:18.958
I'm sure yours will still suffice.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.859
For what?

08:25.799 --> 08:28.934
Carr needs surgery.

08:28.935 --> 08:30.635
Umbilical hernia.

08:30.737 --> 08:34.905
Had it for years, but I need
to have it taken care of.

08:34.907 --> 08:37.142
I've read your hernia paper.

08:37.143 --> 08:38.809
I thought I'd do it for him.

08:38.811 --> 08:40.477
My procedure?

08:40.513 --> 08:43.280
Russell says he's read
the paper thoroughly.

08:43.282 --> 08:46.551
But he's never performed it.

08:46.586 --> 08:48.320
And you'd be doing this at your place?

08:48.321 --> 08:49.953
Of course he would.

08:49.954 --> 08:52.723
We couldn't do it here.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.594
There are rules.

09:01.133 --> 09:03.734
I was thinking,

09:03.735 --> 09:06.036
and no disrespect to you, Russell,

09:06.037 --> 09:07.370
but since I did invent the procedure,

09:07.405 --> 09:10.307
perhaps I should be the one to perform it.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.678
Of course.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.713
You were the first choice.

09:20.718 --> 09:23.053
And we should do it here

09:23.054 --> 09:25.155
if we can.

09:25.156 --> 09:27.490
I'll ask Thackery.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.360
See if he can square it with the board.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.996
Then we'll wait to hear from you.

09:36.433 --> 09:38.901
- Hello?
- We're in here.

09:41.438 --> 09:43.206
Sorry I'm late.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.041
It's quite all right. We waited to eat.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.111
Good evening, Dr. Gallinger.

09:48.112 --> 09:49.946
What are you doing here?

09:50.048 --> 09:53.183
Your wife graciously invited me to dinner.

09:54.518 --> 09:57.953
Why would you invite
Dr. Cotton into our home?

09:57.954 --> 10:00.223
To thank him for what he did for me.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.957
For us.

10:01.958 --> 10:04.226
He's the reason I feel the way I do.

10:04.295 --> 10:07.563
I am very pleased with
how Eleanor's been doing.

10:07.598 --> 10:09.158
I was just saying before you walked in,

10:09.233 --> 10:11.367
I think she might be mentally
fit to have children again.

10:11.368 --> 10:14.670
Isn't that wonderful, darling?

10:17.274 --> 10:18.808
The hospital's been doing so well,

10:18.875 --> 10:21.043
the state of New Jersey
has asked us to expand.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.479
We've seen patients
from across the country,

10:23.480 --> 10:25.114
several from as far away as Europe.

10:25.216 --> 10:28.584
Lucky for you that preying on
the desperate is so lucrative.

10:28.652 --> 10:31.253
Everett, I will not have
you insult our guest.

10:31.254 --> 10:32.654
That's all right, Eleanor.

10:32.655 --> 10:34.323
A man's entitled to his opinion,

10:34.324 --> 10:36.125
misinformed as it may be.

10:36.126 --> 10:39.128
Misinformed?

10:39.129 --> 10:41.863
You mutilated my wife.

10:41.898 --> 10:45.267
And yet here you sit with your wife,

10:45.335 --> 10:48.003
a wonderful host who's
prepared this delicious meal.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.406
Six months ago, you dreamed
of an evening like this.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.808
You think so? Then you're misinformed.

10:55.145 --> 10:57.245
Excuse me.

10:57.246 --> 11:00.081
Let me give you an example.

11:00.116 --> 11:02.450
We had one young man, suffered terribly

11:02.451 --> 11:03.984
his entire life from paranoia.

11:03.986 --> 11:06.521
Distrust of others. He heard voices.

11:06.655 --> 11:09.490
He was a hypochondriac to the
point where he couldn't function

11:09.524 --> 11:11.892
due to his own preoccupation with himself.

11:11.961 --> 11:15.529
Now, as with Eleanor, I
knew sepsis was the cause,

11:15.530 --> 11:17.865
so I removed his teeth at once.

11:17.867 --> 11:19.867
There was little change at first,

11:19.869 --> 11:22.703
but I owed it to this young man to help.

11:22.771 --> 11:25.072
And so I removed his
tonsils and his gallbladder.

11:25.173 --> 11:28.342
Now the distrust disappeared.

11:28.343 --> 11:30.377
So I kept on.

11:30.512 --> 11:33.514
In the end, his spleen, colon,
and testicles, they all came out.

11:33.515 --> 11:35.348
Dear God.

11:37.486 --> 11:40.120
I realize it may seem extreme,

11:40.188 --> 11:44.391
but I'm happy to report
the young man is now home,

11:44.526 --> 11:47.694
he's found employment, no longer
struggles with his symptoms.

11:47.728 --> 11:49.762
He is leading a relatively normal life.

11:49.864 --> 11:51.865
And five years ago, that
would have been impossible.

11:51.866 --> 11:53.600
Normal life?

11:53.668 --> 11:56.536
That young man isn't
a hypochondriac anymore

11:56.671 --> 11:59.539
'cause there's nothing left of
him to be hypochondriacal about.

11:59.540 --> 12:02.275
I don't understand why a doctor

12:02.376 --> 12:04.511
would shrink so timidly from
the frontiers of science.

12:04.512 --> 12:06.413
Is that so?

12:06.414 --> 12:09.349
Are you all right?

12:09.350 --> 12:11.217
I'm not feeling well.

12:11.218 --> 12:13.319
Where is your lavatory?

12:13.386 --> 12:17.323
Please, it's just up the
stairs and to the left.

12:28.401 --> 12:30.502
You really don't need to be so rude.

12:30.503 --> 12:31.937
He's our guest.

12:31.939 --> 12:34.039
Why did you invite him into our home?

12:34.040 --> 12:35.841
I could kill him.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.543
Perhaps you could just remove his teeth.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.447
Without anesthetic.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.950
I wanted him here.

12:45.084 --> 12:48.754
And you will both please try to
remain civil throughout dessert.

12:50.423 --> 12:52.390
I don't have an appetite.

13:13.812 --> 13:15.913
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gallinger.

13:15.982 --> 13:18.716
I am going to get on
home. I'm not feeling well.

13:18.717 --> 13:21.552
I'm so sorry to hear that.

13:21.553 --> 13:24.155
But I'm very glad that you came

13:24.290 --> 13:27.992
so that I could show you my
appreciation for what you did for me.

13:27.993 --> 13:29.459
Of course.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.061
Good night.

13:50.447 --> 13:52.315
Are you ready?

14:00.690 --> 14:02.891
I'll do my best, Mother.

14:07.164 --> 14:09.865
I love you, my darling.

14:09.866 --> 14:11.834
I'll see you when you wake up.

14:28.517 --> 14:30.518
Do you need a drape?

14:31.887 --> 14:35.157
No, she's a patient. She needs a surgeon.

14:35.158 --> 14:36.858
I'm a surgeon.

14:52.507 --> 14:54.308
Thank you.

15:20.734 --> 15:23.403
Right, hand me the electrodes.

15:24.771 --> 15:27.206
Make sure and contact the zinc and mercury

15:27.208 --> 15:28.874
that's been injected into the tumor

15:28.942 --> 15:31.344
in order to ensure that
ionization is complete

15:31.345 --> 15:33.879
and the cancer cells are killed.

15:35.716 --> 15:38.217
You did a nice job with these.

15:38.419 --> 15:41.586
When this is over, I'm gonna have these
melted down into a necklace for her

15:41.587 --> 15:44.189
to cover the scar.

15:44.190 --> 15:46.425
1,000 milliamperes.

15:55.402 --> 15:59.471
Three, two, one.

16:19.591 --> 16:21.759
All right.

16:23.495 --> 16:25.763
Any change?

16:25.764 --> 16:28.065
It should shrink and soften.

16:32.136 --> 16:34.704
We'll have to go again. Increase
the milliamperes to 1,200.

16:35.839 --> 16:38.040
What's going on?

16:38.109 --> 16:40.510
It's all right. I'm a
surgeon here. Dr. Chickering.

16:40.644 --> 16:43.713
There's no surgery scheduled
for tonight and no emergencies.

16:43.747 --> 16:45.115
You're not supposed to be in here.

16:45.116 --> 16:46.716
Yes, I am!

16:48.086 --> 16:49.886
And what about him?

16:52.856 --> 16:54.457
I'm harder to explain.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.594
- Excuse me.
- It's all right. It's all right.

16:58.595 --> 17:01.096
You're against the clock now.

17:03.266 --> 17:04.700
What are you doing?

17:04.701 --> 17:06.702
The laryngectomy.

17:06.703 --> 17:08.637
The tumor is braided into her larynx,

17:08.637 --> 17:10.439
trachea, and esophagus.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.772
How do you expect to remove it?

17:11.773 --> 17:14.209
What do you suggest, then?

17:14.310 --> 17:18.146
Close her up and take a day
to consider your options.

17:18.147 --> 17:20.015
Options?

17:20.016 --> 17:21.348
We know what's gonna happen.

17:21.351 --> 17:23.118
She starves to death or asphyxiates

17:23.119 --> 17:24.986
or chokes on her own spit.

17:32.495 --> 17:33.975
That part of the tumor may come away,

17:34.030 --> 17:35.931
but it'll take too much
of the posterior mucosa.

17:36.032 --> 17:38.699
I'll shave it as closely as I
can, try to limit the damage.

17:38.701 --> 17:40.601
It's tumorous through and through.

17:40.670 --> 17:42.703
God damn it, there's no
windpipe to work with.

17:42.705 --> 17:44.439
It's all tumor. It's torn to bits.

17:44.473 --> 17:46.507
Holes everywhere. Her lips are blue.

17:46.509 --> 17:49.077
She's hypoxic.

17:49.178 --> 17:51.211
Dr. Chickering, what in
God's name are you doing?

17:51.246 --> 17:53.047
In God's name I'm trying to save my mother!

17:53.048 --> 17:55.182
I take full responsibility.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.317
And if you worked here,
that might be worth a damn.

17:57.318 --> 17:58.819
There's no repairing that ventricle.

17:58.854 --> 18:00.887
Just use the tissue to shore up that hole.

18:00.889 --> 18:02.889
Her breathing is becoming labored.

18:02.891 --> 18:04.191
What is Dr. Edwards doing here?

18:04.225 --> 18:05.705
He knew the procedure we were trying.

18:05.727 --> 18:07.094
Then why isn't he leading the surgery?

18:07.095 --> 18:08.429
I've lost sight in my left eye.

18:08.496 --> 18:10.364
It's only recently begun to improve a bit.

18:10.398 --> 18:13.833
So your assisting surgeon is half blind

18:13.868 --> 18:16.135
with no depth perception. Wonderful.

18:16.270 --> 18:19.405
If you would kindly excoriate
us later, we are in trouble here.

18:23.277 --> 18:25.211
Oh, my.

18:26.747 --> 18:29.748
Harvest some tissue from
below the thyroid cartilage

18:29.850 --> 18:32.385
and use that to patch the
space on the tracheal rings.

18:32.452 --> 18:34.920
- Can you see well enough to patch that space?
- Yes.

18:34.921 --> 18:39.358
Good. Now draw the tissue across.

18:39.426 --> 18:41.760
Don't worry yourself with
the cancerous section.

18:41.895 --> 18:44.262
You're just trying to give her
something to breathe through.

18:44.298 --> 18:47.433
Now hold it up against the anterior wall.

18:47.434 --> 18:49.368
I'll suture it.

18:50.870 --> 18:53.772
I'm not clean, but the instrument is.

18:53.773 --> 18:56.574
My patch is almost in.

18:56.710 --> 18:59.344
- She's still not getting any air.
- It's falling apart.

18:59.445 --> 19:01.579
It's shredding the edge of
the tumor near the subglottis.

19:01.581 --> 19:04.083
We need more tissue.

19:04.084 --> 19:06.018
She's cyanotic.

19:10.056 --> 19:11.990
There's no pulse.

19:12.058 --> 19:14.326
We can harvest from the soft palate

19:14.460 --> 19:17.095
and use it to cover the shredded
area near the subglottis.

19:19.165 --> 19:21.065
- Bertie.
- No.

19:22.801 --> 19:24.336
Let her go.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.838
She's been through enough.

19:26.839 --> 19:28.873
Let her go.

19:39.685 --> 19:43.054
Fuck.

19:43.155 --> 19:45.056
You're right, it could
never have succeeded.

19:45.157 --> 19:47.658
From the day she was
diagnosed, she was dead.

19:47.726 --> 19:51.562
It needed to be studied,
it needed to be perfected.

19:51.563 --> 19:54.198
But she was my mother.

19:54.199 --> 19:56.234
What was I supposed to do?

19:56.235 --> 19:59.170
I'm not running a circus.

19:59.171 --> 20:01.038
There are no high-wire acts here.

20:01.039 --> 20:03.006
But sometimes there needs to be.

20:03.008 --> 20:04.742
Sometimes risks have to be taken.

20:04.743 --> 20:07.378
Not in my operating rooms.

20:17.722 --> 20:19.690
I think it best if I resign.

20:24.262 --> 20:26.229
I agree.

20:28.032 --> 20:29.833
It'll save me the task
of having to fire you

20:29.834 --> 20:32.168
for violating protocols.

20:36.374 --> 20:38.508
Now go be with your family.

21:13.210 --> 21:15.377
I'm sorry.

21:18.281 --> 21:20.415
So am I.

21:26.824 --> 21:29.391
I was stupid to think I could do it.

21:29.393 --> 21:31.927
You must be furious with me.

21:33.230 --> 21:35.998
You had the courage to try.

21:35.999 --> 21:38.233
I couldn't even look.

23:04.519 --> 23:06.420
Why's Vera leaving?

23:06.421 --> 23:08.487
- I don't know.
- Pregnant.

23:08.489 --> 23:10.824
- She have anyplace?
- No.

23:10.825 --> 23:12.559
And the father?

23:12.560 --> 23:14.994
Whaler she met at a saloon.

23:15.062 --> 23:17.196
He's somewhere in the
Atlantic for all she knows.

23:17.230 --> 23:21.134
They can't just throw her in the street.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.870
I should try and get her
in on the ward at the Knick.

23:23.904 --> 23:27.273
They'll certainly be
eager to hear from you.

23:27.341 --> 23:29.942
I thought I had baby
troubles just last month.

23:30.043 --> 23:33.780
I told you girls don't let
the fella finish inside you.

23:33.848 --> 23:36.916
I didn't. And Vera said neither did she.

23:37.117 --> 23:41.153
But it ain't like the fella's gonna listen
to a lot of reason while he's in his state.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.421
He's paying to finish where he wants.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.226
You got another way to make a dollar?

23:48.260 --> 23:51.229
Rose, you were a midwife. Tell Nettie.

23:51.297 --> 23:55.167
A man pulling out is just
wishful thinking most times.

23:57.570 --> 24:01.072
But there are other ways to
stop a man getting you pregnant.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.041
What kind of other ways?

24:04.443 --> 24:06.544
We can talk about this another time.

24:12.584 --> 24:15.586
Sleep is coming.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.224
Sleep.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.266
- Did it work?
- Appears so.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.234
Very good.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.505
What do you think?

24:33.506 --> 24:35.773
You're Merlin the wizard.

24:35.774 --> 24:37.642
I can't fathom how that works.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.010
Neither can I.

24:40.112 --> 24:44.081
Seems to reach a part of the
brain that isn't physical.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.550
If one could suggest to
someone who was hypnotized

24:46.585 --> 24:49.453
to do all sorts of humorous feats,

24:49.521 --> 24:52.122
then why not use it for
something more practical?

24:52.123 --> 24:54.825
Change people's perception.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.293
Curb their addiction.

24:56.294 --> 24:58.328
I've heard crazier ideas.

24:58.329 --> 25:00.630
In this room, actually.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.467
What habits does your subject have?

25:07.838 --> 25:10.139
Simple, direct instructions.

25:18.349 --> 25:21.885
- Mr. Cleary...
- Mm.

25:21.886 --> 25:23.387
...when I blow on you,

25:23.388 --> 25:26.390
you will wake and you will no longer

25:26.391 --> 25:28.492
be interested in smoking your pipe.

25:30.562 --> 25:32.662
You will detest it.

25:34.499 --> 25:36.766
The sight of it will anger you.

25:46.577 --> 25:48.511
The fuck is that?

25:48.512 --> 25:50.479
- It's your pipe.
- No. No.

25:50.481 --> 25:52.015
- That ain't mine.
- Yes, it is.

25:52.016 --> 25:54.150
- No.
- Do you want it?

25:54.151 --> 25:57.653
You bet your ass I do.

25:57.687 --> 26:00.222
I'm sorry, Doc, but
all that hocus-pocus...

26:00.323 --> 26:03.358
Yeah, thanks for wasting
our time. Go on, get out.

26:05.428 --> 26:09.564
I wanted to present something to you.

26:10.566 --> 26:12.400
Are you familiar with Garrison Carr?

26:12.401 --> 26:14.102
No.

26:14.237 --> 26:16.371
He's a bit of an established
thinker in certain communities.

26:16.506 --> 26:18.841
He's in need of a hernia repair
and I'd like to perform it.

26:18.842 --> 26:20.909
Which communities?

26:20.910 --> 26:22.777
Little Africa.

26:22.778 --> 26:24.612
Harlem.

26:24.713 --> 26:29.717
Perhaps if the request to
the board came from you.

26:30.853 --> 26:32.587
I can try.

26:34.056 --> 26:36.090
It'll be good if there's
a doctor in the room

26:36.259 --> 26:41.062
so I can revive them once they discover
your proposed patient is a Negro.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.709
Bertie the departed.

26:54.710 --> 26:56.543
I want to come back.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.647
What about Zinberg?

26:59.648 --> 27:01.248
He's extraordinary

27:01.316 --> 27:03.417
and what he's doing over
there would impress you.

27:05.287 --> 27:07.621
Turns out I'm a bit too reckless for him.

27:09.257 --> 27:12.093
I saw the notice in the
paper about your mother.

27:12.094 --> 27:14.028
I'm sorry.

27:16.231 --> 27:18.733
I need the speed of this place.

27:18.734 --> 27:20.801
Of you.

27:22.104 --> 27:24.805
Maybe I've changed.

27:24.907 --> 27:28.442
Perhaps I'm not as reckless
and fast as you remember.

27:30.278 --> 27:33.814
Algernon told me that last month you
performed surgery with a telephone.

27:36.517 --> 27:40.120
Some things have changed, I promise you.

27:40.188 --> 27:43.223
They have with me, too,
or else I wouldn't be here.

27:44.458 --> 27:46.759
I know now that this is where I belong.

27:48.996 --> 27:51.164
I've always known that.

27:59.974 --> 28:02.142
What's he saying?

28:02.143 --> 28:03.943
He doesn't like you being here.

28:04.045 --> 28:07.613
I'm just trying to help him
and get some information.

28:07.615 --> 28:10.015
How long has he been like this?

28:19.126 --> 28:21.894
Has he seen anyone from
the health department?

28:28.668 --> 28:30.069
He's afraid you're trying to deport him.

28:30.070 --> 28:31.403
Assure him I'm not.

28:34.875 --> 28:39.543
He's saying that the guy from the
health department threatened to.

28:39.544 --> 28:41.846
Was his name Speight?

28:41.847 --> 28:43.648
Do you know? Speight?

28:48.220 --> 28:49.888
He's saying he was a pig.

28:49.889 --> 28:51.422
Fat like a barrel.

28:51.423 --> 28:53.624
Speight.

28:53.659 --> 28:57.561
Did you give this to Inspector Speight?

29:09.408 --> 29:11.275
This belonged to his brother Aldo.

29:11.276 --> 29:13.110
May I speak to him?

29:13.111 --> 29:15.212
Aldo died, signorina.

29:16.381 --> 29:18.148
Did he have the same symptoms?

29:30.795 --> 29:33.196
Yes, same symptoms.

29:33.231 --> 29:36.032
Fingers turned black, blood everywhere.

29:36.234 --> 29:39.869
He's saying that he came down the ship
feeling not well and in a week he died.

29:41.539 --> 29:43.406
Did your brother have money?

29:43.407 --> 29:45.241
Was he well-off?

29:47.477 --> 29:48.636
No.

29:48.662 --> 29:52.115
Then how could he afford
a second-class ticket?

30:04.794 --> 30:06.329
He doesn't know.

30:06.330 --> 30:08.297
He doesn't know, but look,

30:08.298 --> 30:10.399
maybe Aldo stole it.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.934
But Gino came here
honestly. He's a good man.

30:13.003 --> 30:15.671
He has a family, a job, you
know? He didn't do no wrong.

30:20.510 --> 30:22.210
You must leave, I'm sorry.

30:22.345 --> 30:25.013
- He needs to see a doctor.
- He wants you to leave. I'm sorry.

30:25.014 --> 30:27.249
Of course. I'm sorry.

30:45.334 --> 30:48.436
After the swelling goes down, try to...

30:48.470 --> 30:50.438
keep it elevated and then you can go home.

30:50.439 --> 30:51.972
Excuse me one moment.

30:56.712 --> 30:58.680
Lucy.

31:01.017 --> 31:04.219
I'm sorry. I'm sure that
must have been a surprise.

31:04.220 --> 31:06.021
A pleasant one.

31:06.022 --> 31:07.655
Welcome back.

31:09.190 --> 31:11.758
I know I felt more than you at one point,

31:11.826 --> 31:13.560
but I won't pretend my
treatment towards you

31:13.628 --> 31:15.996
after our falling out
wasn't intended to hurt you.

31:15.997 --> 31:17.531
It did.

31:17.532 --> 31:19.999
Well, I was angry.

31:21.069 --> 31:23.637
And I acted like a child.

31:23.638 --> 31:25.672
And I'm sorry.

31:27.242 --> 31:29.876
I didn't expect you to forgive me.

31:29.877 --> 31:31.810
Well, I have.

31:31.812 --> 31:33.746
I've learned a lot about forgiveness.

31:33.847 --> 31:36.816
And though I don't expect it,
I hope you'll give me yours.

31:36.817 --> 31:38.984
Of course.

31:40.187 --> 31:42.755
I'd give anything to be friends again.

31:42.756 --> 31:44.557
Me, too.

31:45.993 --> 31:48.161
There's a ball coming up.

31:48.162 --> 31:49.995
Excuse me?

31:50.030 --> 31:53.466
To raise money for the new hospital.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.901
I heard you have a new lady friend.

31:55.902 --> 31:57.903
Oh.

31:57.938 --> 31:59.704
I just thought that if
you wanted to attend,

31:59.706 --> 32:01.907
it would only be fair to her...

32:01.908 --> 32:03.776
I don't know her name.

32:03.777 --> 32:06.078
Genevieve.

32:06.112 --> 32:08.513
To give her ample warning
so that she has time

32:08.515 --> 32:10.482
to get a dress and prepare.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.251
Thank you.

32:13.252 --> 32:15.053
Are you going?

32:15.054 --> 32:17.722
We'll see.

32:23.763 --> 32:25.863
Algie's gonna have Thackery ask the board

32:26.032 --> 32:30.602
if he can perform a surgery on
that D.W. Garrison Carr fellow.

32:32.138 --> 32:34.906
That Carr's in our boy's ear.

32:34.940 --> 32:38.677
Algie's got my vote,
but he's pushing harder

32:38.711 --> 32:41.546
than the rest of the board can stand.

32:41.547 --> 32:44.449
Carr does more harm than good.

32:44.450 --> 32:47.486
Good afternoon.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.920
Let me have a Glenlivit.

32:48.921 --> 32:50.721
- Two, please.
- Yes, sir.

32:50.722 --> 32:52.589
It's too soon.

32:54.393 --> 32:56.627
Barrow said he's received
inquiries from nervous donors

32:56.661 --> 32:59.095
about Algie's involvement going forward.

32:59.097 --> 33:01.264
It's just one surgery.

33:01.299 --> 33:03.967
And Algie invented it, for God's sake.

33:04.002 --> 33:06.837
I'm not quibbling about our boy's skill.

33:06.905 --> 33:09.306
I would take him over Thackery these days.

33:09.307 --> 33:11.875
But our donors believe Thack is a god

33:11.943 --> 33:14.477
and we need them to
continue believing that.

33:20.818 --> 33:22.618
It's not just...

33:22.620 --> 33:24.788
it's not just their estimation

33:24.789 --> 33:27.190
of Thackery that matters.

33:27.258 --> 33:30.760
They clearly don't want
the new Knick integrated.

33:30.862 --> 33:33.664
Meaning having a Negro
doctor or his Negro patients?

33:33.665 --> 33:35.332
Both.

33:35.366 --> 33:38.701
If we want Algie to move uptown with us,

33:38.702 --> 33:41.871
we have to sacrifice something.

33:43.807 --> 33:45.607
So the patients.

34:01.357 --> 34:04.025
So the barge takes all
the lower-class passengers

34:04.060 --> 34:06.327
over to Ellis Island
for the full inspection,

34:06.362 --> 34:08.862
but a doc gives them
a quick once-over here.

34:08.864 --> 34:11.199
What happens if they get marked?

34:11.301 --> 34:13.469
Well, then they got to
see another doctor on Ellis

34:13.469 --> 34:14.936
for a more thorough exam.

34:14.971 --> 34:16.670
If the doc thinks they're too sick

34:16.672 --> 34:18.005
and can't get cured easy here,

34:18.039 --> 34:19.540
then they can't come into the country.

34:19.541 --> 34:21.875
Over 25,000 last year alone.

34:21.876 --> 34:24.143
Where did they all go?

34:24.146 --> 34:26.679
Back to where they came from.

34:26.681 --> 34:28.716
What would send them back?

34:28.717 --> 34:31.185
Anything highly contagious.

34:31.186 --> 34:33.588
Trachoma, typhus, cholera...

34:33.589 --> 34:35.489
- Plague?
- Oh, yeah.

34:35.591 --> 34:38.558
And they'd have to go back
to their country of origin?

34:38.559 --> 34:40.226
Not with embarkation.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.562
See, the shipping companies
have to pay a $100 fine

34:42.563 --> 34:44.330
for each and passage back,

34:44.431 --> 34:48.266
so most of the big companies
do their own health inspections

34:48.335 --> 34:50.837
before the immigrants even
leave their home ports.

34:50.904 --> 34:53.873
The thing is, over there,
people always get through.

34:53.873 --> 34:55.974
We don't miss them on this end.

34:57.710 --> 35:00.045
Is it this crowded every day?

35:00.046 --> 35:02.347
Yeah, and it's getting worse, too.

35:02.449 --> 35:05.617
And this is just the third-class
and the steerage passengers.

35:05.685 --> 35:08.287
What about the first and
second-class passengers?

35:08.288 --> 35:10.221
They got off down there.

35:10.290 --> 35:12.257
Immigration officials
have already met the boats

35:12.359 --> 35:14.259
in the harbor and checked
them out right on the ship.

35:14.393 --> 35:16.694
There's very little risk of
something really infectious

35:16.795 --> 35:19.196
coming from the ones that
can pay to ride in comfort.

35:23.536 --> 35:25.470
Dr. Thackery.

35:25.471 --> 35:29.106
Someone, or maybe someones,

35:29.107 --> 35:30.875
are here to see you.

35:30.876 --> 35:33.010
They're waiting in your office.

35:35.113 --> 35:36.713
Excuse me.

35:44.422 --> 35:46.255
Mr. Brockhurst.

35:46.257 --> 35:48.391
Cab ride here was a dollar.

35:53.598 --> 35:56.300
The one on their right is Zoya
and the one on the left is Nika.

35:56.301 --> 35:58.402
- Say hello, girls.
- Hello.

35:58.403 --> 36:00.469
- Nika.
- Hello.

36:00.470 --> 36:03.139
She's the dumb one.

36:03.140 --> 36:05.075
Excellent.

36:05.076 --> 36:06.775
Well, let's get started.

36:06.777 --> 36:08.177
If you'd like to come with me, please.

36:08.245 --> 36:09.813
Whoa, whoa. Where are you taking them?

36:09.814 --> 36:11.981
The X-ray room.

36:12.083 --> 36:15.318
I want to see what bones
and organs they might share.

36:15.352 --> 36:17.553
If you want them to take their clothes off,

36:17.621 --> 36:21.290
that'll cost more if that's
what you want them for.

36:21.325 --> 36:23.626
No, that is not what I want them for.

36:23.627 --> 36:25.061
Many men do.

36:25.129 --> 36:27.730
Not a one ever said it
wasn't worth the money.

36:29.366 --> 36:32.067
If you want to wait in the
lobby, I'll be about an hour.

36:37.207 --> 36:40.208
If you'll just follow me.

36:40.210 --> 36:41.943
All the modern gadgets...

36:41.945 --> 36:44.446
electric toaster, gas stove.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.614
They're even installing a dumbwaiter

36:46.649 --> 36:48.550
all the way from the service entrance

36:48.551 --> 36:50.952
for ice and food deliveries.

36:50.987 --> 36:52.720
I could learn to cook for you, Hermie.

36:52.722 --> 36:55.690
Ah, we'll hire someone for that.

36:55.691 --> 36:58.159
Cook you anything you want.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.961
When can we move in?

36:59.962 --> 37:03.130
Mmm, about a month or so.

37:03.165 --> 37:05.533
Every project in New York is being slowed

37:05.534 --> 37:08.302
because of the demand for workers.

37:08.371 --> 37:11.740
I'll need the time to
gather the rest of the funds

37:11.741 --> 37:14.208
to pay for your freedom.

37:14.209 --> 37:16.511
I don't want you spending a minute longer

37:16.512 --> 37:18.879
than you need to at Ping Wu's.

37:20.915 --> 37:24.217
So, can you see us here?

37:24.218 --> 37:26.152
It's beautiful.

37:32.327 --> 37:35.929
It would have been nice
to be able to see the park.

37:35.997 --> 37:39.198
Well, those apartments
are a bit more expensive.

37:39.199 --> 37:41.300
Oh.

37:41.335 --> 37:44.737
It's just with all of my expenses,

37:44.738 --> 37:46.706
we still have to buy furniture.

37:46.707 --> 37:48.908
I understand, Hermie.

37:48.942 --> 37:51.978
You're doing the best you can, I suppose.

38:04.925 --> 38:08.127
Just imagine if we were higher up.

38:08.261 --> 38:11.363
What it would be like to look
out the window when we fuck.

38:13.133 --> 38:15.200
I'd bend over...

38:16.903 --> 38:19.104
and you'd pull up my skirt.

38:22.042 --> 38:24.276
Pull out your hard dick.

38:25.645 --> 38:28.546
Feel for my wet coo.

38:33.085 --> 38:36.887
And look out onto the entire
park as you slip it into me.

38:41.293 --> 38:44.262
King Hermie and his big baddie.

38:56.941 --> 38:59.075
I want her for another hour.

39:11.689 --> 39:13.790
So these are both your ribs.

39:13.791 --> 39:16.159
And your hearts would be inside.

39:16.261 --> 39:19.695
This is the band of muscles
that connect the two of you.

39:19.696 --> 39:22.431
And this is your liver.

39:23.466 --> 39:26.101
You only have one for the two of you.

39:29.806 --> 39:33.809
Now, if that's the only organ you share,

39:33.877 --> 39:37.112
I believe it might be
possible to separate you.

39:39.116 --> 39:41.083
Separate?

39:41.118 --> 39:43.519
If that is something you would want.

39:43.620 --> 39:46.322
I'd need a lot more
information in order to do it.

39:46.356 --> 39:50.058
More examinations. More about your past.

39:50.060 --> 39:52.994
Not the story he makes you tell.

39:52.995 --> 39:55.196
The truth.

39:58.401 --> 40:00.868
How did you come to meet Mr. Brockhurst?

40:02.638 --> 40:05.873
We were living in forest in Siberia.

40:05.874 --> 40:07.976
He was an explorer.

40:07.977 --> 40:11.146
You're not onstage.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.348
It's just us.

40:18.687 --> 40:20.855
Where are you from originally?

40:22.058 --> 40:25.226
We were both born in Minsk.

40:25.261 --> 40:28.529
Well, if only one of
you were born in Minsk,

40:28.530 --> 40:29.897
that would be a miracle.

40:33.268 --> 40:35.402
Our father didn't want us

40:35.437 --> 40:38.606
and sold us to circus when we were babies.

40:38.607 --> 40:42.176
We went from one to the next.

40:42.177 --> 40:46.647
Prague, Bologna, Marseilles,

40:46.782 --> 40:50.985
then Blackpool where Mr.
Brockhurst bought and bring us here.

40:52.754 --> 40:54.721
How does he treat you?

40:55.958 --> 40:58.259
Better than some.

40:59.895 --> 41:01.929
Have you ever been to school?

41:01.930 --> 41:03.563
Can you read?

41:03.565 --> 41:05.800
I know some letters and numbers.

41:05.801 --> 41:07.701
How about you, Nika?

41:08.603 --> 41:10.770
Nika is shy.

41:10.771 --> 41:12.873
She's smart, though.

41:12.874 --> 41:14.541
More than me.

41:16.211 --> 41:19.245
What does Mr. Brockhurst
say about working for him?

41:22.283 --> 41:25.552
We are his property.

41:26.988 --> 41:32.326
He tell us that no one else protect us.

41:32.327 --> 41:34.861
If we left him, where would we go?

41:34.996 --> 41:39.466
In this country they would
throw us in cage and let us die.

41:40.968 --> 41:44.637
So he protect us.

41:44.638 --> 41:46.806
We do what he says.

41:48.909 --> 41:51.744
And what about these men
that he was talking about?

41:56.350 --> 41:59.185
I'm not gonna think anything bad of you.

41:59.186 --> 42:01.487
I just want to help.

42:05.592 --> 42:07.460
Sometimes...

42:09.996 --> 42:14.400
men want us to be naked with them.

42:15.702 --> 42:19.338
Watch us kiss each other.

42:20.473 --> 42:22.607
Touch each other.

42:23.810 --> 42:25.610
Be with them.

42:26.713 --> 42:28.513
Jesus.

42:30.216 --> 42:33.651
Not like the story Mr.
Brockhurst tell, is it?

42:35.655 --> 42:37.589
No, Nika.

42:39.325 --> 42:41.326
Not even close.

42:49.002 --> 42:50.568
What took so long?

42:50.636 --> 42:53.305
It took me a little while
to get what I wanted.

42:53.306 --> 42:55.207
- Did you?
- I did.

42:55.208 --> 42:56.641
But I need to see them again.

42:56.642 --> 42:57.975
Why?

42:57.977 --> 43:00.645
Because as I was telling them,

43:00.713 --> 43:03.482
I believe it might be
possible to separate them.

43:03.483 --> 43:05.450
What, split them apart?

43:05.485 --> 43:07.519
For good? Why the fuck would I want that?

43:07.653 --> 43:10.522
No one's gonna pay to see two
girls who used to be connected.

43:10.556 --> 43:13.424
No, but they'd be able
to live a normal life.

43:13.425 --> 43:14.858
I don't give a good goddamn.

43:14.860 --> 43:16.394
Them girls make me money that way.

43:16.495 --> 43:18.455
Lots of it. And you're
not gonna monkey with that.

43:18.497 --> 43:20.431
I think they should decide for themselves.

43:20.565 --> 43:22.633
Who the fuck do you think you're
dealing with? They're mine.

43:22.701 --> 43:24.401
I got documents saying
I'm their legal guardian

43:24.402 --> 43:25.736
just like if I was their daddy.

43:25.738 --> 43:26.871
Now where's that money you owe?

43:26.872 --> 43:28.739
Their time and my meal.

44:32.235 --> 44:34.603
- You fuckin' parasite.
- Who the hell are you?

44:37.074 --> 44:39.074
- Stay down, stay down, stay down.
- Shh, shh, shh.

44:39.142 --> 44:42.078
- Stay down.
- Everything's fine. You're safe.

44:42.079 --> 44:43.779
Come with me.

44:43.780 --> 44:45.347
Quiet.

44:45.348 --> 44:46.982
All right.

44:50.285 --> 44:52.086
Sorry about that.

44:54.256 --> 44:57.625
So tomorrow I'll be by to
talk to you about some things.

44:57.626 --> 44:59.527
Medical things.

44:59.528 --> 45:02.030
But for now, I want you to rest up.

45:02.031 --> 45:04.465
You're safe here.

45:04.533 --> 45:07.835
Mr. Cleary will be with
you as long as you want.

45:07.937 --> 45:10.938
And he'll be just outside
the door while you sleep.

45:12.808 --> 45:14.808
I'll see you in the morning.

45:17.813 --> 45:19.447
Don't worry.

45:19.514 --> 45:21.649
I ain't gonna let nothing
happen to you girls.

45:21.650 --> 45:23.851
- Do you mind?
- No.

45:25.153 --> 45:27.354
So, uh...

45:27.356 --> 45:28.923
don't peg me as rude or nothing,

45:29.124 --> 45:31.492
but you two got me asking all
kinds of questions in my head.

45:31.493 --> 45:34.461
Like for instance,

45:34.463 --> 45:36.597
how do you two take a shite?

45:36.698 --> 45:39.166
Is it together like or does it
all just go through one of you?

45:43.238 --> 45:45.472
Now, I'm going to place a clamp

45:45.474 --> 45:47.808
on the hepatoduodenal ligament.

46:06.161 --> 46:08.661
Normally, when you cut into the liver,

46:08.696 --> 46:12.332
the hemorrhaging would
be enormous, but watch.

46:21.375 --> 46:22.876
There's virtually no blood loss.

46:22.877 --> 46:24.844
And our patient?

46:29.183 --> 46:31.217
Pulse is steady.

46:31.218 --> 46:34.453
This is the key to the separation.

46:34.521 --> 46:36.855
We enter here at the
bottom where they're joined,

46:36.890 --> 46:40.326
get access to the
ligament and clamp it off.

46:40.393 --> 46:43.529
The delicate work will be
to split the liver in half,

46:43.530 --> 46:45.797
giving equal amount to each girl

46:45.866 --> 46:48.934
so that it can regenerate
evenly in both of them.

46:49.069 --> 46:51.036
We should also be
concerned about not damaging

46:51.070 --> 46:53.204
the peritoneum around the intestines.

46:53.306 --> 46:56.308
I'm more concerned about that
Brockhurst fellow showing up again.

46:56.309 --> 46:58.676
Oh, I've taken care of that.

47:02.614 --> 47:04.715
Harry.

47:04.817 --> 47:08.419
You two waiting for the rest
of your ball team to show up?

47:08.454 --> 47:10.488
Just looking out for a scum sucker.

47:10.489 --> 47:12.323
What brings you around here?

47:12.424 --> 47:15.660
I was going to see if I could
get a bed for a girl in trouble.

47:15.661 --> 47:17.829
Not so sure if I should go in, though.

47:17.830 --> 47:18.996
You want I should ask for you?

47:18.997 --> 47:20.798
Appreciate it.

47:20.899 --> 47:24.234
Though you might want to
leave my name out of it.

47:24.236 --> 47:26.103
You're looking a bit pale.

47:26.104 --> 47:27.839
Are you sick?

47:27.840 --> 47:29.707
Not eating much.

47:30.743 --> 47:32.409
Let's buy you some lunch.

47:32.478 --> 47:34.811
Pounce can watch the
door by himself for a bit.

47:34.846 --> 47:36.780
If you bring me back a sausage.

47:36.781 --> 47:38.915
If you got some money.

47:44.321 --> 47:45.922
Thanks.

47:55.832 --> 47:58.568
You ain't gonna find a better
beef and Guinness pie around.

47:58.668 --> 48:01.804
Close your eyes and you'll
think you're in Dublin.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.174
What's the matter?

48:05.175 --> 48:07.643
Nothing.

48:07.644 --> 48:10.145
I paid 10 cents for that.

48:10.147 --> 48:12.381
You've got to eat something.

48:12.383 --> 48:14.817
Get that color back in your cheeks.

48:20.991 --> 48:22.691
What is it?

48:22.692 --> 48:25.461
I'm fine. Just go about your food.

48:25.462 --> 48:27.063
Oh, Christ, Harry.

48:27.064 --> 48:29.031
I don't want your pity.

48:29.066 --> 48:31.400
Then I won't give it to
you, but for fuck's sake,

48:31.501 --> 48:34.237
it's all right to let me of
all people see you hurting.

48:34.238 --> 48:35.938
Why you?

48:35.972 --> 48:38.373
What makes you think you're so special?

48:38.542 --> 48:42.477
I'm the only one who never thought
you was rock-hard from the start.

48:42.512 --> 48:44.412
I knew you were soft under that habit.

48:44.414 --> 48:47.550
Human. Or you gonna deny that, too?

48:47.551 --> 48:49.552
I never said I wasn't human.

48:49.553 --> 48:52.019
Yeah, well, no human deserves

48:52.154 --> 48:54.688
to take the beating you've been
taking these last few months.

48:54.690 --> 48:56.758
I think all the time, you know,

48:56.826 --> 49:00.327
if it's killing me, what's it doing to her?

49:00.329 --> 49:02.864
It's breaking me, that's what.

49:04.399 --> 49:06.734
I've got less than nothing.

49:06.735 --> 49:09.537
I'm useless. No good to anyone.

49:09.538 --> 49:11.906
No job, no calling.

49:11.907 --> 49:13.908
No purpose.

49:15.110 --> 49:17.712
It ain't easy

49:17.713 --> 49:20.448
losing what you lost.

49:20.449 --> 49:22.517
Defrocked.

49:22.518 --> 49:25.186
Unmasked.

49:25.220 --> 49:29.257
I got nowhere to turn, no one who cares.

49:29.291 --> 49:31.859
I can't even stand up
to the sisters anymore.

49:31.894 --> 49:34.461
I'm scared as all the rest of them.

49:34.529 --> 49:37.430
With no job, they're going to kick me out.

49:37.431 --> 49:40.033
I'm bound for the street.

49:40.034 --> 49:41.868
Those fucking goats.

49:41.903 --> 49:44.337
It's a charity home. They can't do that.

49:44.472 --> 49:47.573
They can if they're charging me
for a bed and I got no way to pay.

49:47.642 --> 49:50.076
What about the $3 I've
been sending you every week?

49:52.146 --> 49:54.380
What $3?

49:56.484 --> 49:58.619
You ain't been getting it?

49:58.620 --> 50:00.720
Those holy fucking sisters.

50:00.822 --> 50:03.089
They've been flogging you day
and night for what you done

50:03.090 --> 50:04.391
and then they steal your money.

50:04.392 --> 50:06.660
Bunch of wicked cunts!

50:06.661 --> 50:08.862
It makes no difference.

50:08.930 --> 50:11.698
Your handouts or theirs,
I'm still a charity case.

50:11.733 --> 50:13.099
I don't know what I'm going to do.

50:13.100 --> 50:14.734
This is what you're going to do.

50:14.735 --> 50:16.502
You're going to leave that place

50:16.504 --> 50:18.103
and you're going to live with me.

50:18.105 --> 50:19.505
That ain't a fucking invitation.

50:19.606 --> 50:21.641
I told you I had the lady
down the hall make a curtain.

50:21.642 --> 50:23.409
So you make up whatever rules you like

50:23.411 --> 50:25.478
and I'll follow them to the tee.

50:25.479 --> 50:26.779
But you're coming with me.

50:26.780 --> 50:29.114
And that's that.

50:31.252 --> 50:32.752
Think I could get a whiskey?

50:32.753 --> 50:34.754
Have mine.

50:35.689 --> 50:37.990
Wicked fucking cunts.

51:10.056 --> 51:12.391
Would you like me to heat up
last night's roast for you?

51:12.392 --> 51:14.458
No.

51:18.731 --> 51:20.698
Thank you

51:20.733 --> 51:23.334
for taking care of so
much these past few days.

51:26.371 --> 51:28.306
I'm happy to help.

51:34.179 --> 51:36.147
You brighten my spirits.

51:40.019 --> 51:42.887
Well, I think I may be able
to brighten them a bit more.

51:44.923 --> 51:47.090
You don't know it yet,

51:47.158 --> 51:51.061
but Saturday is going
to be a red-letter day

51:51.096 --> 51:55.432
in the life of Dr. Bertram Chickering Jr.

51:55.433 --> 51:57.334
- Oh?
- Mmm.

52:03.775 --> 52:06.743
Is it some kind of holiday?

52:06.745 --> 52:09.546
Yeah, you could call it that.

52:09.580 --> 52:14.117
Uh, Cecily is visiting
her brother at Harvard

52:14.118 --> 52:16.485
and won't be back until Sunday,

52:16.586 --> 52:21.190
so that means we have my
apartment all to ourselves.

52:32.435 --> 52:34.870
Is that for the ball?

52:36.106 --> 52:38.274
Yes.

52:40.610 --> 52:42.244
Once this procedure is done,

52:42.279 --> 52:44.780
no one will stare at them like freaks,

52:44.781 --> 52:47.248
like they're monsters.

52:47.383 --> 52:50.418
Can you imagine how they'll
feel when they're finally normal?

52:51.754 --> 52:53.588
No...

52:53.589 --> 52:55.791
I can't.

52:55.792 --> 52:58.426
Oh, that's not what I meant.

52:58.494 --> 53:01.062
- I'm sorry. I just get excited.
- Stop it, John.

53:02.231 --> 53:04.399
I am what I am and I can live with that.

53:05.802 --> 53:07.769
But I can't live like this.

53:07.770 --> 53:09.404
I don't understand.

53:09.405 --> 53:11.806
I can't live with you here, John.

53:14.943 --> 53:17.311
You arrived one night and you were back.

53:19.447 --> 53:22.383
You needed me and I... I wanted that.

53:24.252 --> 53:27.621
So I wait for your knock on my door.

53:27.655 --> 53:31.792
No matter what the hour, I wait here,

53:31.793 --> 53:33.660
hoping you'll come.

53:35.463 --> 53:38.532
Even though I know you've just
been with some other woman.

53:38.533 --> 53:40.100
Abby.

53:40.168 --> 53:42.469
And you have every right.
I have no claim on you.

53:45.173 --> 53:48.274
What could a woman like me
rightly expect from any man?

53:51.379 --> 53:53.346
But it's too hard now...

53:55.316 --> 53:57.517
knowing we'll never be together.

53:59.987 --> 54:01.888
I can't fool myself any longer

54:01.889 --> 54:04.223
and it's...

54:04.225 --> 54:06.292
Being near you is just too painful.

54:07.895 --> 54:09.730
Abby, I love you.

54:09.731 --> 54:11.965
- Oh.
- I never stopped.

54:11.966 --> 54:13.399
You only come here to talk.

54:13.401 --> 54:16.503
You go elsewhere for everything else.

54:16.504 --> 54:18.538
Please just leave.

54:18.539 --> 54:20.640
Abby.

54:20.641 --> 54:23.175
I need you to go.

54:26.480 --> 54:28.280
No.
