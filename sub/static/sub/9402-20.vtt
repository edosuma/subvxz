02:28.791 --> 02:29.907
What's going on, Nate?

02:29.958 --> 02:32.160
When the Wagoneer
hit Lauren's S.U.V.,

02:32.244 --> 02:34.612
where was it coming from,
north or south?

02:34.663 --> 02:36.947
It was coming from the south,
heading north.

02:39.968 --> 02:41.969
We got the wrong Kellerman.

02:42.054 --> 02:43.287
It wasn't August.

02:43.338 --> 02:45.840
It was Ian.

02:45.908 --> 02:47.892
But he confessed.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.761
You said Professor Kellerman
came to the Rivercourt

02:49.812 --> 02:50.845
and said
that he did it.

02:50.929 --> 02:52.129
He lied.

02:54.016 --> 02:57.018
The bottle I found
in the Wagoneer was Phidian's.

02:57.102 --> 02:59.821
And then
tonight at the bar,

02:59.905 --> 03:04.325
Ian ordered shots of bourbon
to toast Lydia.

03:04.410 --> 03:06.327
Phidian's.

03:06.412 --> 03:08.246
Said it's all he drinks.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.980
All right. So, maybe
it's a family thing.

03:10.032 --> 03:11.282
It doesn't really
prove anything.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.617
There's more.

03:12.668 --> 03:14.151
At the Rivercourt,
when Kellerman confessed,

03:14.203 --> 03:16.704
he said he was coming from
a dinner that night in Raleigh.

03:16.789 --> 03:18.206
So?

03:18.290 --> 03:19.841
So, he was coming
from the south.

03:19.925 --> 03:21.158
Raleigh's north.

03:21.210 --> 03:22.343
All right, well, look,

don't beat yourself up
over it just yet.

03:24.179 --> 03:26.047
I mean, you could still be wrong.
Maybe.

03:26.131 --> 03:27.598
But if I'm right,

03:27.666 --> 03:30.518
August Kellerman just ended
a 30-year career because of me.

03:30.602 --> 03:32.637

training camp.

07:10.258 --> 07:11.175
Oh. That's too bad.

But I do have camp.

07:27.901 --> 07:29.902

invite the girls?

Haley can't go,

07:32.039 --> 07:33.322

By the way, I leave the day

so you might want
to come straight home

Well, on the upside,
Lydia and I talked,

10:48.635 --> 10:49.852

every weekend in New York,

I'm gonna be right here.

38:08.064 --> 38:09.648
No, no, no, no,
it's not...

38:14.053 --> 38:16.354
But you would stay with me?

38:16.405 --> 38:18.406
Of course.

38:18.491 --> 38:22.727
♪ ...Like I have found you ♪

38:22.778 --> 38:25.163
What do you mean
it's -- it's not okay?

38:25.231 --> 38:29.701
Now <i>I</i> have something
to tell <i>you.</i>

38:38.928 --> 38:40.912
Hey, handsome.

38:40.963 --> 38:42.931
Hi.

38:45.518 --> 38:47.602
I turned down the job.
In New York? Why?

38:55.061 --> 38:58.313
When I was living there
and running Clothes Over Bros,

38:58.397 --> 39:01.650
my office looked out
on this building nearby,

39:01.734 --> 39:03.618
and on the rooftop
was a playground

39:03.703 --> 39:06.288
where all the grade-school kids
would have recess.

39:06.372 --> 39:10.108
And some days
when things were crazy --

39:10.159 --> 39:12.327
which was most days --

39:12.411 --> 39:14.746
I'd look out, and I'd watch
those kids run around,

39:14.797 --> 39:18.550
and I'd think,
"that's no way to play."

39:18.617 --> 39:19.884
I mean, I love New York,

39:19.952 --> 39:22.504
but living in constant fear

39:22.588 --> 39:25.373
of losing the kickball over
the roof of your playground

39:25.441 --> 39:28.026
is kind of a rough way
to grow up.

39:28.094 --> 39:29.394
So you turned down
the job

39:29.461 --> 39:31.396
because the schools
have playgrounds on the roof?

39:31.463 --> 39:33.815
I turned down the job
because I don't want our child

39:33.899 --> 39:36.268
to have a playground
on the roof.

39:36.352 --> 39:40.905
Unless it's the roof of my store
here in Tree Hill.

39:40.973 --> 39:43.575
Tree Hill...
Okay, you're losing me.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.577
Chase had to take
a drug test,

39:45.644 --> 39:49.030
but a guy in Kid Cudi's posse
made him take a hit of a joint,

39:49.115 --> 39:52.917
so he asked Alex to pee in a cup
for him because she's sober.

39:52.985 --> 39:54.336
Except Alex
isn't really sober

39:54.420 --> 39:57.172
because she accidentally ate
some of Quinn's pot brownies,

39:57.256 --> 39:58.757
so Alex came over
to ask you,

39:58.824 --> 40:00.792
because her and Chase
are getting closer,

40:00.843 --> 40:02.961
and she wanted to be the one
to help him,

40:03.012 --> 40:04.879
but you weren't home,
so Alex asked me.

40:04.964 --> 40:10.501
And the lab called Chase
and said that he's pregnant.

40:10.553 --> 40:12.503
What?

40:12.555 --> 40:15.357
So Chase told Alex,

40:15.441 --> 40:18.276
and Alex told me,

40:18.344 --> 40:20.729
and I took
a pregnancy test.

40:22.898 --> 40:25.033
We're pregnant.

40:25.117 --> 40:26.985
