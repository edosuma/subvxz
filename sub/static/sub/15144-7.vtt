- Thank you

06:08.750 --> 06:12.000
for trusting us.

06:08.750 --> 06:12.000
- We won't let you down.

06:08.750 --> 06:12.000
- Don't worry, Mom.

06:12.041 --> 06:13.333
Nothing's gonna

06:12.041 --> 06:13.333
go wrong.

06:16.041 --> 06:19.291
How did it go so wrong

06:16.041 --> 06:19.291
so fast?

06:19.333 --> 06:22.291
We probably shouldn't have

06:19.333 --> 06:22.291
split up.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.291
How did that happen?

06:24.333 --> 06:26.125
I was at

06:24.333 --> 06:26.125
the flying toy kiosk,

06:26.166 --> 06:29.208
and I did not

06:26.166 --> 06:29.208
see it coming.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.875
How did that happen?

06:31.917 --> 06:34.458
I went a little crazy

06:31.917 --> 06:34.458
at the lotion kiosk.

06:34.500 --> 06:38.333
Ow, it still burns!

06:38.375 --> 06:40.417
How'd you get lotion

06:38.375 --> 06:40.417
in your eyes?

06:40.458 --> 06:41.750
It's not just

06:40.458 --> 06:41.750
in my eyes.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.542
It's in the ducts!

06:44.583 --> 06:46.875
Just be glad you can't see

06:44.583 --> 06:46.875
Dawn's makeup.

06:46.917 --> 06:49.166
Hey, I was at

06:46.917 --> 06:49.166
the makeup counter,

06:49.208 --> 06:51.500
and the lady

06:49.208 --> 06:51.500
gave me a makeover.

06:51.542 --> 06:54.875
More like a make over,

06:51.542 --> 06:54.875
and over, and over.

06:54.917 --> 06:57.750
Says the guy

06:54.917 --> 06:57.750
with no pants.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.375
How could you

06:57.792 --> 07:00.375
lose your pants?

07:00.417 --> 07:01.542
I didn't lose 'em.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.375
I left them

07:01.583 --> 07:03.375
on the dressing room floor.

07:03.417 --> 07:04.959
- Why?

07:03.417 --> 07:04.959
- 'Cause that's where

07:05.000 --> 07:06.625
they belong.

07:06.667 --> 07:09.333
When I tried on a pair

07:06.667 --> 07:09.333
of Chunk-a-relli jeans,

07:09.375 --> 07:12.834
it was like taking my legs

07:09.375 --> 07:12.834
on an exotic vacation.

07:12.875 --> 07:16.166
I thought it was pronounced

07:12.875 --> 07:16.166
Ciancarelli.

07:16.208 --> 07:18.333
Isn't it

07:16.208 --> 07:18.333
See-in-sa-relli?

07:18.375 --> 07:20.083
No, no, no.

07:20.125 --> 07:22.125
It's pronounced

07:20.125 --> 07:22.125
"go get your pants!"

07:22.166 --> 07:24.208
Not doing it.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.417
Once you've wrapped your trunk

07:24.250 --> 07:26.417
in some Chunks,

07:26.458 --> 07:29.125
there's no going back.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.291
But you can't walk around

07:29.166 --> 07:31.291
the mall like that.

07:33.417 --> 07:34.709
Okay.

07:39.291 --> 07:42.417
Well, at least

07:39.291 --> 07:42.417
we'll know our way around.

07:42.458 --> 07:46.333
See?

07:42.458 --> 07:46.333
Cool and helpful.

07:46.375 --> 07:49.458
Really? You're gonna walk

07:46.375 --> 07:49.458
around the mall in a sarong?

07:53.500 --> 07:57.375
Hey, if this is sarong,

07:53.500 --> 07:57.375
I don't wanna be right.

07:59.917 --> 08:02.000
Okay, look, we have 20 minutes

07:59.917 --> 08:02.000
to get Dad's food.

08:02.041 --> 08:03.542
Where's the food court?

08:03.583 --> 08:05.792
Hold still, Dicky.

08:08.500 --> 08:12.000
It looks like

08:08.500 --> 08:12.000
it's just above his knee.

08:12.041 --> 08:13.875
To just above his knee!

08:15.583 --> 08:18.083
- These are great.

08:15.583 --> 08:18.083
- Nope. No, absolutely not.

08:18.125 --> 08:19.375
Look at this.

08:18.125 --> 08:19.375
This is the coolest--

08:19.417 --> 08:20.792
- Tom, stop.

08:19.417 --> 08:20.792
- We gotta get these--

08:20.834 --> 08:22.250
Honey, no.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.250
Put that down.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.291
- Please.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.291
- No, look, I'm--I'm starving.

08:24.333 --> 08:28.458
Ow, the hunger pains

08:24.333 --> 08:28.458
are getting sharper.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.875
I don't know what

08:28.500 --> 08:29.875
childbirth feels like,

08:29.917 --> 08:33.000
but I'm pretty sure

08:29.917 --> 08:33.000
this is worse.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.917
Honey, if you say that

08:33.041 --> 08:34.917
one more time,

08:34.959 --> 08:36.458
these women are gonna

08:34.959 --> 08:36.458

08:36.500 --> 08:39.750

08:36.500 --> 08:39.750
childbirth feels like.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.750
- I don't know.

08:50.792 --> 08:54.333

Do I?

09:07.625 --> 09:10.417
You again?

09:07.625 --> 09:10.417
I already cut you off.

What?

09:10.458 --> 09:12.792
I can handle my lotion!

09:12.834 --> 09:14.834
Sorry about him.

Hey, don't you go

09:14.875 --> 09:18.083

You think I go to high school?

Oh, wow,

09:23.583 --> 09:28.417
- Thanks!

Yo, Aramis, you have to help

09:34.125 --> 09:36.208
me lose something

09:36.250 --> 09:40.000
so I can say, "Hey, girl.

09:36.250 --> 09:40.000

Hey, I'm watching you,

Okay,

09:48.542 --> 09:50.417
there's the food court.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.625
Does anyone have

09:50.458 --> 09:52.625
any of Mom's money left?

09:52.667 --> 09:54.333
I spent mine

09:52.667 --> 09:54.333
on the helicopter.

09:54.375 --> 09:55.917
Lip gloss.

09:55.959 --> 09:58.625
I bought a Chunk-a-relli

09:55.959 --> 09:58.625
pocket.

09:58.667 --> 10:02.041
It's a $5 slice of heaven.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.417
I bought

10:02.083 --> 10:03.417

For what?

10:04.750 --> 10:08.000

Yeah, they'll be
