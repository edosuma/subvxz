WEBVTT

00:11.928 --> 00:15.598
We want the accused
to be judged righteously.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.308
We demand the abolishment

00:17.392 --> 00:19.561
of the Juvenile Act
as it has no regard for the victims.

00:20.228 --> 00:24.024
The results of the first trial
in the Yeonhwa Child Murder case

00:24.107 --> 00:25.900
have been controversial.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.235
After committing such a heinous crime,

00:27.318 --> 00:29.154
one of the culprits
received 20 years in prison

00:29.237 --> 00:31.698
while the other received 2 years
in a juvenile reformatory due to his age.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.908
-Yes.
-What do you think?

00:33.992 --> 00:38.329
I agree that the two-year maximum sentence
should be extended to five years,

00:38.413 --> 00:41.875
or that the threshold for the punishment
of minors should be adjusted.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.001
However…

00:43.084 --> 00:45.378
I don't agree with abolishing
the Juvenile Act.

00:45.462 --> 00:49.674
Without it, all crimes committed by minors
would be ruled by criminal law

00:50.258 --> 00:51.801
but that's unrealistic.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.186
<i>I just got a call
from Seong-u's public defender.</i>

01:01.269 --> 01:03.563
<i>Seong-u's mother has decided
not to appeal.</i>

01:03.646 --> 01:05.648
<i>She'll accept the results
of the first trial.</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:06.858
Is that so?

01:08.735 --> 01:10.111
All right, then.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.654
Let's talk more tomorrow.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.531
<i>Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

01:15.241 --> 01:16.076
Yes?

01:16.159 --> 01:18.953
<i>Some kid's here looking for you.
What should I do?</i>

01:20.371 --> 01:21.664
Send them up.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.418
ASSOCIATE JUDGE'S OFFICE

01:28.296 --> 01:29.297
You…

01:31.966 --> 01:33.635
Where's Judge Cha?

01:34.385 --> 01:35.720
Judge Cha?

01:35.804 --> 01:37.347
Cha Tae-ju…

01:37.847 --> 01:39.098
Hey, kid!

01:39.182 --> 01:40.850
Hey! Wake up!

01:40.934 --> 01:42.519
Wake up, Yu-ri!

01:42.602 --> 01:43.478
Yu-ri!

01:44.646 --> 01:45.688
Judge Sim.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.857
Wake up. Wake up, Yu-ri!

01:47.941 --> 01:50.318
Yu-ri! What's wrong with her?

01:50.401 --> 01:52.570
-Call an ambulance.
-Right.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.032
-Here he comes!
-He's here!

01:58.618 --> 02:01.538
The judiciary has regained
the public's trust through this trial

02:01.621 --> 02:03.081
Would you care to comment?

02:03.164 --> 02:05.917
Do you agree
that the Juvenile Act should be revised?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.253
What we learned from this case is

02:09.254 --> 02:12.757
that juvenile criminal cases
are no longer a personal matter.

02:12.841 --> 02:17.220
It's time for society,
and the entire country, to step up.

02:18.805 --> 02:23.268
I was just doing what needed to be done.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.227
Thank you.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.229
-One more comment, please!
-One more comment!

02:26.312 --> 02:28.106
-Sir!
-One more comment, please.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.574
-This way.
-Please fill out the registration first.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.454
Judge Sim, I'll…

02:45.790 --> 02:47.959
EMERGENCY ROOM REGISTRATION FORM
PATIENT NAME: SEO YU-RI

02:52.881 --> 02:54.549
What's your relation to the patient?

02:55.174 --> 02:56.134
Why do you ask?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.177
Here they are.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.058
Judge Cha?

03:04.726 --> 03:05.894
Hello.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.021
<i>An assault?</i>

03:08.104 --> 03:09.856
We see many cases like this.

03:09.939 --> 03:13.526
We have to call it in if we suspect
the patient is a victim of assault.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.196
We're dispatched when a report is made,

03:17.280 --> 03:20.074
but most assault cases
end without leading anywhere.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.368
People these days
don't want to get involved.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.537
And oftentimes
the victim refuses to report it.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.831
Let us know when she wakes up.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.250
Thank you.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.047
<i>It's probably not domestic abuse.</i>

03:35.131 --> 03:36.758
<i>She doesn't have that kind of guardian.</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:47.060
<i>Her parents divorced when she was 12,</i>

03:47.143 --> 03:49.354
<i>and her grandparents
raised her since then.</i>

03:51.272 --> 03:53.358
-Is he coming?
-Yes.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.152
-Is Jun-seop coming too?
-I think so.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.738
-Let's go.
-Do you have a thing for him?

03:59.280 --> 04:01.950
<i>Her grandfather is currently
hospitalized with dementia,</i>

04:02.033 --> 04:04.452
<i>and her grandmother is sick as well.</i>

04:04.535 --> 04:06.579
<i>Her parents have been
out of touch for a while.</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:09.040
-Hit me, asshole.
-Stop.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.793
-You bitch!
-Hey, that's enough!

04:11.876 --> 04:14.170
-Hey! What the hell!
-Hey!

04:14.254 --> 04:15.672
-Fucking hit me!
-Hey!

04:18.424 --> 04:20.385
What's going to happen to her now?

04:20.468 --> 04:22.720
Her injuries seemed pretty severe.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.889
The whole thing will
probably just blow over.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.226
Taking on a juvenile case isn't worth it.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.728
It's not like anyone will give a damn.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.149
-Wake me up when we're at the station.
-Yes, sir.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.241
She was put under probation and admitted
to a shelter for theft and prostitution.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.826
Her name is Seo Yu-ri.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.161
<i>Seo Yu-ri? She's infamous.</i>

04:47.245 --> 04:49.080
<i>It's been a while
since she went off the grid.</i>

04:49.163 --> 04:52.250
<i>I was going to report it to you.
You're the judge in charge, right?</i>

04:53.001 --> 04:56.879
<i>We call her every night to check
if she's home, but she never picks up.</i>

04:56.963 --> 04:59.632
<i>She hasn't even shown up
to the weekly attendance check.</i>

05:00.133 --> 05:02.302
<i>She's not at home,
she won't pick up calls…</i>

05:02.385 --> 05:05.096
<i>I've never seen such a troublemaker.</i>

05:05.179 --> 05:06.931
Yes. Okay.

05:12.603 --> 05:13.646
You're still here?

05:13.730 --> 05:14.939
Yes.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.275
I tried calling her friends,

05:18.067 --> 05:21.779
but they hadn't seen her
since she got a job at a hair salon.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.115
She goes to work early
and ends late at night.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.951
Isn't that a violation of
the Labor Standards Act?

05:27.035 --> 05:29.787
I'm not quite sure.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.041
I guess we'll find out when she wakes up.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.711
It's getting late. You should get going.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.046
You're not going?

05:38.129 --> 05:41.340
Yes, I have a lot of questions
to ask her when she wakes up.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.521
<i>We'll know for sure
once the test results come in,</i>

05:55.605 --> 05:59.442
<i>but it seems like she has a fractured rib
and a contusion on her left wrist.</i>

05:59.525 --> 06:01.360
<i>Her inflammation levels are also high.</i>

06:01.444 --> 06:03.404
<i>This isn't from a one-time incident.</i>

06:03.488 --> 06:04.781
<i>She's been abused long-term.</i>

06:09.160 --> 06:10.787
Hey, are you awake?

06:14.373 --> 06:16.167
Hold on. Let me get a doctor.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.210
No…

06:20.755 --> 06:21.756
I…

06:22.590 --> 06:24.425
I must've lost my mind.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.135
I'm really okay.

06:26.844 --> 06:27.970
I should get going.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.436
You came all the way to the courthouse

06:36.104 --> 06:37.480
in the middle of the night

06:38.231 --> 06:39.315
when you're okay?

06:43.945 --> 06:45.655
You'd rather speak to Judge Cha, right?

06:46.322 --> 06:50.159
-It's okay if I make you uncomfortable.
-No, I'm really okay.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.043
You say you're okay,

06:59.710 --> 07:01.504
but your injuries say otherwise.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.799
If I hadn't found out
I may have let you walk out of here,

07:06.050 --> 07:07.343
but I can't let you go now.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.514
I'll give you a day to think about it.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.225
Call me if you change your mind.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.979
If you don't, I'll handle it my way.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.902
I took care of the hospital bill,
so just stay here.

07:26.654 --> 07:27.697
Get yourself treated.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.339
Finally, the US is one of the countries
that uphold human rights

07:45.423 --> 07:48.843
and respond strictly to domestic violence.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.804
Therefore, most judicial authorities
in the United States

07:51.888 --> 07:55.975
are required to sentence the assailant
within 24 hours of the report

07:56.058 --> 07:59.145
and impose strong criminal penalties
on the perpetrator.

07:59.228 --> 08:03.858
Also, during the trial, contact between
the victim and perpetrator is minimized

08:03.941 --> 08:05.902
so that the victim's safety is ensured

08:05.985 --> 08:08.863
and they are aided
through a lawyer support system.

08:08.946 --> 08:13.743
These efforts stem from the awareness
that domestic violence is a crime.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.495
That'll be all.

08:17.079 --> 08:21.292
Thank you. That was Judge Lee Jeong-seok.

08:22.668 --> 08:27.131
Would anyone like to say a few words
regarding his presentation?

08:35.556 --> 08:36.557
Yes?

08:38.893 --> 08:40.228
Judge Sim Eun-seok?

08:40.311 --> 08:41.395
So…

08:42.772 --> 08:44.440
what's the point?

08:44.524 --> 08:48.402
Are you proposing that we do exactly
what they do in the States?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.948
According to the Ministry
of Gender Equality and Family,

08:52.031 --> 08:54.283
53,8% of Korean families
suffer from domestic violence,

08:54.367 --> 08:57.870
and more than 93 people
fall victim to it every year,

08:57.954 --> 09:01.415
where their lives are threatened
or they end up dying.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.669
If we count the cases
that haven't been reported,

09:04.752 --> 09:06.671
we're only scratching the surface.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.924
But what's more hopeless is that

09:10.550 --> 09:12.718
no one knows for sure

09:13.427 --> 09:14.971
when domestic violence will end.

09:18.891 --> 09:22.144
<i>Let's say there's a girl and she's
a suspected victim of domestic abuse.</i>

09:22.812 --> 09:25.898
<i>The hospital and her school
both report it to the police.</i>

09:26.524 --> 09:28.859
But her family can say
that there's no domestic violence,

09:28.943 --> 09:29.986
that they're mistaken.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.113
The moment they deny it,

09:33.197 --> 09:36.242
the police can no longer intervene
and the investigation ends.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.704
Even now,
countless domestic violence cases

09:39.787 --> 09:42.164
are closed due to such reasons.

09:42.248 --> 09:46.919
Given this reality, how do we minimize
contact between the assailant and victim

09:47.003 --> 09:49.380
and have the assailant
stand trial within 24 hours?

09:49.463 --> 09:51.966
Is this even possible?

09:53.634 --> 09:58.014
We could at least revise the way in which
domestic violence cases are handled.

09:58.639 --> 10:03.311
That way, things that are actually useful
could be discussed in seminars like these.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.023
Does Presiding Judge Kang
not train his judges?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.942
Gosh, judges these days.

10:10.026 --> 10:14.238
How dare she say those things when
a chief judge is giving a presentation?

10:14.322 --> 10:16.073
-Gosh, that rude little…
-Gosh.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.992
-The world is going to the dogs.
-Gosh.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.911
What is wrong with you?

10:23.623 --> 10:28.336
Don't you know how touchy
the chief judges are during a seminar?

10:28.419 --> 10:32.840
Can't you tell when and when not to
share your opinion?

10:32.923 --> 10:34.675
Isn't the point of these seminars
to share our opinions?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.552
Still, you were way out of line.

10:38.512 --> 10:41.891
Even college kids don't give presentations
like Presiding Judge Lee did today.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.978
He just looked through some books
and did a little research online.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.648
They say time is gold.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.733
Gold is the same as money.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.444
I wasted a lot of money today.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.737
Eun-seok!

10:54.820 --> 10:58.282
Seminars are held so that ideas
can be shared regardless of age and rank.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.619
I wasn't refuting
anyone's arguments today.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.996
I was merely sharing my opinion.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.583
That's the problem.
Do you know what a ruckus you caused?

11:09.669 --> 11:10.670
You see this?

11:11.879 --> 11:12.797
Hey.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.133
Presiding Judge Lee! Yes.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.345
Yes. Sure.

11:20.137 --> 11:23.307
Judge Cha,
you should head down to the lobby.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.226
Me?

11:27.812 --> 11:28.938
Why?

11:37.696 --> 11:38.989
Mom.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.157
Tae-ju.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.785
You should've called.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.287
I packed you some food.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.917
Why did you pack so much?

11:53.838 --> 11:55.089
Where's Judge Cha?

11:55.172 --> 11:58.050
He's in the lobby. His mother is here.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.011
She packs some dishes
and visits him from time to time.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.305
When Judge Cha is in a trial,
I go instead.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.099
Her timing was spot on today.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.436
-I see.
-You know, it's quite odd.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.605
Judge Cha and his mother are very close.
Almost like friends.

12:11.689 --> 12:15.151
It's unusual for sons to be
that close to their mothers.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.362
I guess he grew up with a lot of love.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.491
I hope I can be that close
to my son in the future too.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.951
Just like Judge Cha.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.747
You weren't talking about me now,
were you?

12:28.831 --> 12:30.082
No.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.419
My mother cooked up a storm again.
I think I should share them.

12:33.502 --> 12:36.755
I was craving your mother's food.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.466
Tell her I said thank you.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.719
My mom made some
for you as well, Judge Sim.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.182
I'm okay. Give it to someone else.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.184
I don't eat at home.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.856
Did I do something wrong?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.816
No. What's gotten into her?

12:57.359 --> 12:59.570
Oh my. This looks delicious.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.997
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

13:10.998 --> 13:13.125
I'm from Yeonhwa District Court.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.836
You know Seo Yu-ri, right?

13:16.962 --> 13:18.547
<i>Abuse?</i>

13:18.631 --> 13:21.675
I admit that our workload is intense
compared to other salons,

13:22.510 --> 13:23.677
but we did not abuse her.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.930
Did she say that we hit her?

13:26.764 --> 13:29.892
No, I'm just checking the facts.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.853
How is she usually?

13:34.897 --> 13:37.483
I told you it's 8874, not 6.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.903
How many times is that?

13:40.986 --> 13:44.448
Can't you even clean up properly?
These products can't be mixed up.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.242
<i>I had to keep an eye on her.</i>

13:46.742 --> 13:49.662
<i>She made many mistakes
and she showed up erratically.</i>

13:50.246 --> 13:52.748
<i>The hair designers
don't regard her too highly either.</i>

13:52.831 --> 13:55.209
<i>Things are pretty tense
at the salon because of her.</i>

13:57.127 --> 14:00.422
When does she get on and off work?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.591
It depends on the shift.

14:03.259 --> 14:07.680
Since she's a minor, she gets off
after seven hours according to the law.

14:08.722 --> 14:09.682
Are you sure?

14:10.349 --> 14:13.686
I could show you
the security footage if you'd like.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.276
Wait! Excuse me!

14:20.985 --> 14:21.819
I…

14:23.320 --> 14:25.573
I have something to say to you.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.952
-Welcome.
-Come on.

14:31.412 --> 14:35.791
<i>Some strange man
came to see Yu-ri multiple times.</i>

14:39.044 --> 14:40.963
<i>I'm not sure if it's him,</i>

14:41.046 --> 14:43.299
but I saw that her face
was bruised a few times.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.677
Whenever she missed work,
it was because of him.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.723
I switched shifts with her a few times
because she seemed badly hurt.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.767
And he looked much older than her.

14:54.643 --> 14:57.271
But he seemed a little…

14:59.690 --> 15:01.567
<i>I'm not sure if I should be saying this,</i>

15:03.027 --> 15:05.237
but it seemed like underage prostitution.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.035
Sir, please turn the car around.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.621
Please take me to
Yeonhwa Hospital instead of the court.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.914
Yes, ma'am.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.710
Yes, I'll change the disposition.
Please let me know how it goes.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.296
Okay.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.174
Excuse me.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.886
Didn't you attend Busan Middle School?

15:30.179 --> 15:31.263
Pardon?

15:32.014 --> 15:33.641
Cha Tae-ju, isn't it?

15:33.724 --> 15:36.936
It's me, Jeong Jin-mo!
I used to live next door to you.

15:39.229 --> 15:43.275
I think you have the wrong person.
I didn't attend Busan Middle school.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.445
My apologies. I must've been mistaken.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.949
I have a friend named Cha Tae-ju
and you two look so much alike.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.284
I'm sorry.

EMERGENCY ROOM

16:06.548 --> 16:07.800
Sim Eun-seok speaking.

16:07.883 --> 16:11.595
Can you check if Seo Yu-ri was involved
in a sex crime since her release?

16:11.679 --> 16:12.846
By tomorrow morning.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.684
I'm telling you, no.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.560
How many times do I have to tell you?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.729
I just fell on my own. I wasn't beaten.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.564
That doesn't make any sense.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.193
Why would you come all the way
to the courthouse if you just fell?

16:27.111 --> 16:29.029
How do you get hurt like this
from falling?

16:29.113 --> 16:31.281
Please just stay out of it.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.659
Who is that man anyway?

16:36.704 --> 16:38.539
I heard he hit you a few times before.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.916
-Did you go asking around about me?
-That's not all.

16:45.713 --> 16:49.091
Just say the word.
I'll send you to a facility right away.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.053
Yu-ri.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.430
There you are.

16:54.930 --> 16:58.183
But who are you?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.436
I'm Judge Sim Eun-seok
from Yeonhwa District Court.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.271
Are you Yu-ri's grandmother?

17:02.354 --> 17:05.441
Oh dear. I am so ashamed.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.692
My sweet Yu-ri…

17:07.359 --> 17:11.989
Oh my, you should have
offered her a drink at least.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.575
No, that's okay. I was about to leave.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.493
About Yu-ri's injuries--

17:16.577 --> 17:19.663
Yes, she fell.

17:20.330 --> 17:24.168
It's just that she's such a frail girl.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.045
-Pardon?
-It's true.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.547
She falls all the time.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.716
Right, Yu-ri?

17:36.013 --> 17:37.973
-But, ma'am…
-Oh dear. What am I doing?

17:38.724 --> 17:42.102
The nurse wants to see Yu-ri.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.897
May we go?

17:45.731 --> 17:48.817
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.653
Let's go.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.074
I'm so sorry.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.128
Hey, Reporter Kim.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.839
I'm still at the courthouse.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.466
Dinner?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.261
Okay. I'll check my messages.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.891
MESSAGES
<i>HANWOOL DAILY</i> REPORTER KIM

18:20.974 --> 18:23.143
GYEONGHWAWON, 7 P.M.
RESERVATION UNDER EOM JUN-GI

18:31.693 --> 18:34.154
ASSEMBLYMAN EOM JUN-GI

18:37.741 --> 18:40.494
The by-elections will be held in October.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.039
Your political stances are
perfect for our party,

18:44.957 --> 18:49.044
so I thought I'd meet you in person
to say hello.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.090
Well…

18:53.841 --> 18:56.468
I've worked
in the courthouse for 22 years.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.221
I feel more at home enforcing the law

19:00.639 --> 19:01.890
in the courthouse

19:02.724 --> 19:04.434
than enacting and revising them.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.187
The courthouse

19:08.063 --> 19:11.358
suits me better
than the National Assembly.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.443
I see.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.948
I heard something shocking recently.
Can I ask you a question?

19:18.031 --> 19:18.907
Sure.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.493
Of all the juvenile crimes
that take place,

19:21.577 --> 19:24.705
only one percent of them
are severe enough to be aired on TV.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.249
They also say 15 percent of them
are school violence offenses,

19:27.332 --> 19:31.170
and the rest is juvenile delinquency
derived from poverty,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.298
domestic violence and family trouble.
Is this correct?

19:34.882 --> 19:38.552
Well, I can't say that it's true
with 100 percent certainty,

19:38.635 --> 19:42.431
but those under less fortunate
circumstances tend to be overlooked.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.769
The court is well aware of that fact.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.107
Then that's even better.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.444
Juvenile welfare
and the revision of the Juvenile Act

19:55.527 --> 19:57.404
are duties of the National Assembly.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.825
If you take into account
what can be done for our youths,

20:02.492 --> 20:04.119
I think it'll be better for them

20:04.995 --> 20:07.164
if you were at the National Assembly.

20:12.085 --> 20:15.088
Since more young adults
are beginning to vote

20:15.881 --> 20:18.675
our party desperately needs you.

20:19.968 --> 20:23.764
It's time the Assembly
opened its ears to the youth.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.522
Although only one to two percent
of the voters are 18 years old,

20:32.606 --> 20:35.609
social media is practically run
by teens and those in their twenties.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.402
We can't underestimate their influence.

20:38.987 --> 20:42.866
"Juvenile criminal cases
are no longer a personal matter.

20:42.950 --> 20:47.287
It's time for society,
and the entire country, to step up."

20:47.371 --> 20:51.708
It's time for society,
and the entire country, to step up.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.544
Please step up
like you said in your interview.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.757
At the Assembly, not the courthouse.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.969
Once you make the decision

21:03.762 --> 21:05.639
we'll take care of the rest.

21:08.141 --> 21:12.145
We'll make sure you're more suited
for the Assembly than the courthouse.

21:18.568 --> 21:21.196

I'm looking for a patient.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.054

22:09.286 --> 22:11.663
Can I help you?

22:13.540 --> 22:16.877
We stay with the elderly all day long.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.839
It's hard not to know
what's going on with their family.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.427
I know what their sons do for a living

22:25.510 --> 22:27.596
and all kinds of other details.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.640
You're here because
of their granddaughter?

22:31.808 --> 22:32.809
Yes.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.186
<i>Stop talking!</i>

22:34.269 --> 22:35.270
Yu-ri.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.397
Why does it always have to be me?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.191
Why should I put up with it?

22:39.274 --> 22:43.653
<i>Kids these days don't care
about their sick grandparents.</i>

22:44.488 --> 22:46.281
<i>You know right away.</i>

22:46.364 --> 22:49.284
<i>She has red hair, reeks of cigarettes,</i>

22:49.367 --> 22:53.288
<i>and even yells at her grandmother.
She's so rude.</i>

22:53.371 --> 22:54.748
Okay. You're all set.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.750
<i>I've never seen anyone like her.</i>

22:58.710 --> 23:00.545
There's probably more to her than that.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.257
<i>If she was really rude,
she wouldn't have even visited her.</i>

23:04.341 --> 23:07.719
<i>And she wouldn't have given
her grandfather a haircut.</i>

23:08.303 --> 23:09.930
Yu-ri visits almost every day, right?

23:10.013 --> 23:12.349
Well, yes.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.851
I wondered why she always went home late

23:14.935 --> 23:16.686
when she only works seven hours a day.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.065
I think I just found my answer.

23:22.275 --> 23:23.568
What about her parents?

23:25.487 --> 23:26.738
Do you know anything?

23:26.822 --> 23:27.781
I sure do.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.617
Everyone in this hospital knows
about her dad.

23:31.409 --> 23:33.703
Gosh, he has such a temper.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.997
He causes a ruckus every time he comes.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.751
They pay their hospital bills
with funding from the government,

23:39.835 --> 23:41.628
but he keeps asking them for money.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.339
He even wants their welfare funds.

23:44.422 --> 23:46.258
I thought they lost contact with him.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.801
No way.

23:47.884 --> 23:50.554
Yu-ri hates talking about her dad.

23:52.097 --> 23:56.143
<i>Some strange man came
to see Yu-ri multiple times.</i>

23:56.226 --> 23:58.895
Yes, she fell. Right, Yu-ri?

24:02.941 --> 24:04.359
It was her dad.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.157
Sim Eun-seok speaking.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.284
<i>Yeonhwa Police Women and Juvenile Affairs,
Ko Gang-sik.</i>

24:12.367 --> 24:14.452
Was Seo Yu-ri discharged
from the hospital?

24:14.536 --> 24:15.912
Why do you ask?

24:15.996 --> 24:17.998
His father is at the station

24:18.874 --> 24:20.709
<i>and he wants to report her as a runaway.</i>

24:22.169 --> 24:23.211
What?

24:23.837 --> 24:27.465
Normally, we dispatch
as soon as we get the report,

24:28.508 --> 24:31.178
but something seemed a bit off.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.346
Seo Yu-ri is
a victim of domestic violence.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.598
Her father abuses her.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.601
<i>She cannot come in contact
with the perpetrator.</i>

24:38.101 --> 24:41.563
Do what you can to dismiss
the runaway report.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.578
Where will we go once I'm discharged?

24:58.246 --> 25:01.291
He's probably looking for us right now.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.085
Gosh, how rude.

25:08.506 --> 25:10.634
I'm sick of staying at a sauna.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.386
If we're going to run, let's go far away.

25:14.596 --> 25:15.889
Don't you feel bad for me?

25:16.514 --> 25:18.391
I've been hospitalized because of him.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.644
I do feel bad for you.

25:21.853 --> 25:27.442
I feel so bad for you
that my heart is in pieces.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.153
But, Yu-ri.

25:30.820 --> 25:35.283
He's still your dad and my son.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.870
Yu-ri.

25:39.621 --> 25:45.168
Can't you just put up with him
a little longer?

25:46.378 --> 25:49.381
It's not his fault he's like that.

25:50.006 --> 25:50.966
Yu-ri.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.218
Yu-ri.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.392
How can I help you?

26:00.475 --> 26:04.062
It's for Judge Cha Tae-ju,
from a juvenile reformatory in Busan.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.605
-Busan?
-Yes.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.566
<i>Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.</i>

26:08.650 --> 26:10.068
<i>Yes, I'm calling from
the juvenile reformatory in Busan.</i>

26:10.151 --> 26:11.945
<i>It's the Juvenile Criminal
Collegiate Division, right?</i>

26:12.028 --> 26:14.447
Yes. You're calling
about the plant, right?

26:14.531 --> 26:16.866
I'll make sure Judge Cha gets it.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.744
<i>Really? Thank you so much.</i>

26:19.828 --> 26:23.290
<i>He's been donating money
for the kids here for over six years.</i>

26:23.373 --> 26:26.793
<i>I wanted to repay him
but he would always refuse.</i>

26:26.876 --> 26:28.003
I see.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.840
<i>Please make sure he gets it.</i>

26:31.923 --> 26:33.091
Okay. I will.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.636
Good morning.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.723
Judge Cha. You have a delivery.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.270
THANK YOU, JUDGE CHA TAE-JU
BUSAN JUVENILE REFORMATORY

26:50.525 --> 26:55.613
Could you please send the plant back?
I'll call the sender and let him know.

26:55.697 --> 26:58.074
He asked me to make sure you got this.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.118
It's the thought that counts.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.244
I can't accept this.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.163
Please.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.123
Okay. I'll do so.

27:09.377 --> 27:12.172
These are the documents regarding
Seo Yu-ri that you asked for last night.

27:13.006 --> 27:13.923
I see.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.010
Did she have any records?

27:17.093 --> 27:20.305
Except for violating her probation,
there were none.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.015
Take care.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.809
NAME: SEO YU-RI

27:32.359 --> 27:34.402
What's this? You got a new plant.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.947
We didn't buy it. It's from
a juvenile reformatory in Busan.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.157
Busan?

27:39.240 --> 27:40.367
Why did they send it?

27:44.621 --> 27:48.124
Wasn't Yu-ri hospitalized?
Why are you checking her records?

27:50.043 --> 27:51.669
Things have changed.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.546
She's suffering from domestic violence.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.633
-Her father seems to be the abuser.
-What?

27:57.384 --> 27:58.510
Did you report it?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.678
Where's the father?

28:00.762 --> 28:03.390
What did the police say?

28:05.809 --> 28:07.143
Judge Sim.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.145
Yu-ri is refusing to file a report.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.314
CRIMINAL RECORD
NAME: SEO YU-RI

28:12.399 --> 28:14.526
Then why are you checking her records?

28:18.530 --> 28:19.739
This can't be what I think it is.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.950
VIOLATION OF PROBATION
SUBJECT OF GUIDANCE: SEO YU-RI

28:26.621 --> 28:27.664
It is.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.125
It's exactly what you think it is.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.460
Seo Yu-ri will be separated
as a status offender.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.214
What?

28:38.133 --> 28:40.135
Isn't Judge Cha amazing?

28:40.885 --> 28:42.887
How could he for six years?

28:42.971 --> 28:47.267
But he made me send back the plant.
He said it's the thought that counts.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.187
Well, that's just who he is, a good man.

28:52.605 --> 28:53.481
I mean…

28:54.232 --> 28:56.359
How do you raise a kid
to turn out like that?

28:57.527 --> 28:59.320
Isn't it strange?

28:59.404 --> 29:01.406
Why Busan of all places?

29:01.990 --> 29:06.035
Think about it. This was the first
juvenile court he was ever assigned to.

29:06.119 --> 29:09.247
And we're only associated with
other courthouses in Seoul or Gyeonggi.

29:09.330 --> 29:12.709
So why would he donate to a reformatory
in Busan for such a long time?

29:12.792 --> 29:13.710
Is it his hometown?

29:13.793 --> 29:15.378
-That's plausible.
-Right?

29:15.462 --> 29:17.380
She's a victim.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.966
Don't you care about her?
She needs to be protected.

29:20.550 --> 29:21.843
I mean, how…

29:22.427 --> 29:24.929
How could you think of separating her
by sentencing her?

29:26.556 --> 29:29.350
She didn't do anything to deserve it
and, even if she did,

29:29.434 --> 29:31.311
she needs to be protected right now.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.021
If she's refusing to report it,
you need to convince her.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.607
Why are you cornering her like that?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.611
This is my case and mine alone.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.031
Isn't it within my right to sentence her?

29:44.866 --> 29:48.161
Yes. But, still, this is too much.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.538
I won't let this slide.

29:51.331 --> 29:55.502
And if you won't? Are you
going to impede on my jurisdiction?

30:08.848 --> 30:10.099
This is Sim Eun-seok.

30:10.183 --> 30:14.187
<i>This is Yeonhwa Hospital.
Are you the judge in charge of Seo Yu-ri?</i>

30:14.270 --> 30:16.564
<i>Are you with her right now?</i>

30:20.360 --> 30:23.696
<i>I went to let her know when she'll be
discharged but she wasn't there.</i>

30:24.364 --> 30:25.448
<i>Her legal guardian
isn't picking up either.</i>

30:25.532 --> 30:26.908
Have you seen patient Seo Yu-ri
in Room 523?

30:29.994 --> 30:33.540
We'll look for her and let you know.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.043
What's going on?

30:37.919 --> 30:39.504
Seo Yu-ri went missing from the hospital.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.600
EUN SO-HUI
WHERE ARE YOU?

30:52.684 --> 30:55.687
<i>This is Sim Eun-seok.
I spoke to you at the convalescent home.</i>

30:55.770 --> 30:58.731
If you happen to see Seo Yu-ri

30:58.815 --> 31:01.025
please call me as soon as possible.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.071
No, it's nothing serious.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.657
Yes.

31:08.908 --> 31:10.618
Yes. Please call me.

31:13.955 --> 31:17.166
She was here
when we checked her vitals this morning.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.086
I checked the security footage
and she did leave the hospital.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.589
And her legal guardian?

31:22.672 --> 31:25.174
She went looking for her
with the hospital security team.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.509
Okay.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.928
RESTRICTED AREA
NO ENTRY EXCEPT DURING VISITING HOURS

31:30.388 --> 31:31.556
Let's split up.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.225
I'll make some calls and look for her.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.978
I'll go check the places she frequents
and call you.

31:37.061 --> 31:37.979
Okay.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.607
Is this the probation office?

31:41.149 --> 31:43.484
I'm Judge Sim Eun-seok
from Yeonhwa District Court.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.194
A juvenile went missing.

31:45.278 --> 31:48.031
Her name is Seo Yu-ri.
Date of birth is December 1, 2004.

31:48.990 --> 31:49.824
Please hurry.

31:51.784 --> 31:52.952
NAME, PHONE NUMBER

31:55.872 --> 31:56.915
STAR COIN KARAOKE

31:56.998 --> 31:59.667
-Have you seen her around here?
-No, I haven't.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.463
-I'll just take a look around.
-Sure.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.099
-What the hell?
-I'm sorry.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.064
Come on, pick up.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.358
You really didn't tell anyone, right?

32:24.734 --> 32:26.235
I'll just stay for a few days.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.739
Of course, I brought the money.

32:29.822 --> 32:30.949
Hold on.

32:31.032 --> 32:31.908
JUDGE CHA TAE-JU

32:31.991 --> 32:33.201
Damn it.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.371
I'm almost there.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.374
Damn, why is it so cold today?

32:39.457 --> 32:40.750
Am I at the right place?

32:41.834 --> 32:43.586
Yes, I think I am.

32:53.763 --> 32:54.931
Hey, So-hui.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.358
I thought you were alone.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.447
Frisk her.

33:15.451 --> 33:18.037
Move. Move it, you bitch!

33:18.121 --> 33:19.747
-Let go of me.
-Where are you going?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.249
-Let go!
-Give me my money!

33:21.332 --> 33:22.291
Let me go!

33:24.085 --> 33:26.087
Let go, damn it! Let go of me!

33:26.170 --> 33:27.171
You bitch!

33:40.226 --> 33:42.562
No! It's my money. Fuck!

33:42.645 --> 33:43.646
Give it back!

33:44.814 --> 33:47.316
-Fuck!
-Bitch, that's not my problem.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.027
Give me my fucking money!

33:55.783 --> 33:57.618
How can you do this to me?

33:57.702 --> 34:00.204
No one told you to fucking fall for it.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.374
-Jackass.
-You fucking bitch.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.251
What did you just fucking say?

34:06.502 --> 34:08.546
You should have listened, bitch.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.640
JUVENILE POLICE ACADEMY

34:26.230 --> 34:31.069
Judge Sim.
Maybe Yu-ri's dad took her away.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.695
No, I don't think so.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.655
He doesn't even know she was hospitalized.

34:37.075 --> 34:40.244
I'll keep looking. Please let me know
as soon as you hear anything.

34:44.665 --> 34:45.666
Sim Eun-seok speaking.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.211
<i>I'm calling from
the convalescent hospital.</i>

34:48.795 --> 34:49.754
Yes?

34:50.797 --> 34:53.549
<i>Judge Cha. I just got a call.</i>

34:53.633 --> 34:55.093
WOORI CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL

34:55.176 --> 34:56.469
<i>I think I found Yu-ri.</i>

35:11.692 --> 35:13.444
What are you crying about?

35:18.658 --> 35:19.742
What is it?

35:20.576 --> 35:23.579
What happened to your face?
Who did this to you?

35:24.330 --> 35:26.582
What's wrong with my life?

35:27.750 --> 35:30.503
Why is my life so shitty?

35:33.172 --> 35:35.383
I wanted to turn over a new leaf.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.469
I wanted to get away from it…

35:40.680 --> 35:42.807
but I can't.

35:49.605 --> 35:50.565
Yu-ri.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.068
Let's tell the police everything.
I'll help you.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.322
What difference will that make?

35:58.406 --> 36:01.159
A restraining order.
And we'll take away his parental rights.

36:01.242 --> 36:05.246
We can stop him from contacting you
through any means.

36:05.329 --> 36:09.083
-You can leave home and stay at a shelter.
-I don't want to.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.295
I've been putting up with him.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.506
So why do I have to leave?

36:15.590 --> 36:17.508
I was the one who got hurt,

36:18.509 --> 36:21.512
so why am I always the one
that has to run away?

36:25.349 --> 36:29.520
If we put a restraining order on him,
will the police protect me at all hours?

36:30.479 --> 36:31.856
They won't.

36:31.939 --> 36:36.819
What if that bastard tries
to get revenge and hurt me?

36:38.321 --> 36:40.615
I can't tell the police
because I'm scared.

36:40.698 --> 36:44.535
It's not that I won't.
I can't because I'm scared.

36:49.498 --> 36:50.791
And what if you stay quiet?

36:52.168 --> 36:53.252
What then?

36:55.338 --> 36:58.424
You'll run away if he hits you again
and you'll resort to stealing

36:58.507 --> 36:59.842
if you run out of money.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.303
It's none of your business.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.058
I'm sick of this.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.187
Do you have any idea
how many people were looking for you?

37:11.270 --> 37:13.773
Your attitude is seriously pissing me off.

37:13.856 --> 37:14.732
Judge Sim.

37:16.150 --> 37:19.737
Fine. I can't force her to do anything
if she doesn't want to.

37:20.529 --> 37:23.324
I've done my part, right?

37:25.243 --> 37:28.037
I found her.
She's at the convalescent hospital.

37:28.621 --> 37:29.664
Yes.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.500
Who was that?

37:32.583 --> 37:34.669
Your friends you met when you went AWOL…

37:35.503 --> 37:36.629
You're in a runaway gang with them, right?

37:36.712 --> 37:38.839
Yes, but I'm the victim here.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.424
Save it for the police.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.218
Then the phone call just now--

37:42.301 --> 37:44.971
The Juvenile Act, Section 4, Clause 1.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.348
"Juveniles who are prone
to committing criminal offenses

37:48.516 --> 37:50.559
will be taken into custody
as a status offender."

37:51.352 --> 37:54.230
-Judge Sim!
-Yes, I admit it.

37:55.231 --> 37:58.526
I thought I might have
taken it too far like you said.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.404
But you just admitted
that you're a part of a runaway gang.

38:01.487 --> 38:04.031
I didn't commit any crimes, Judge Sim.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.242
You should have,
so I could send you to the reformatory!

38:06.325 --> 38:08.452
I didn't break any laws.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.582
Yu-ri, it's okay. Stop crying.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.086
-Calm down. Can you stand up?
-I didn't do anything wrong.

38:17.169 --> 38:19.547
WOORI CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL

38:19.630 --> 38:20.840
It's okay.

38:28.222 --> 38:30.516
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

38:32.768 --> 38:34.228
How could you do that?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.023
Don't you have any compassion?

38:38.149 --> 38:40.776
Yu-ri has nowhere else to go
because of her abusive father.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.738
So she ran away and joined a gang.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.781
Shouldn't you be asking
why she joined them

38:45.865 --> 38:48.284
rather than being upset that she did?

38:50.244 --> 38:52.663
Judge Sim,
I've been wondering for a while now.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.957
Just out of curiosity,

38:56.417 --> 38:58.127
why do you hate young offenders so much?

38:59.503 --> 39:00.338
What?

39:00.421 --> 39:02.798
Why do you always hurt them with words

39:02.882 --> 39:06.427
and always try so hard
to see if you can find a fault in them?

39:06.510 --> 39:08.012
Why are you so mad at them?

39:08.095 --> 39:09.347
Because they're criminals.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.643
They dared to commit a crime…

39:16.771 --> 39:18.606
at such a young age.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.528
Let me ask you something.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.490
Is this something to be so upset about?

39:27.573 --> 39:29.909
Why are you always on their side?

39:30.534 --> 39:32.078
Do they have something on you?

39:32.161 --> 39:34.330
-Judge Sim!
-What is it then?

39:36.415 --> 39:38.334
Why do you keep butting in on my case?

39:42.755 --> 39:43.798
<i>Come on out!</i>

39:46.467 --> 39:49.512
Come out. Come out, you bastard!

39:51.305 --> 39:52.515
Come out!

39:53.599 --> 39:55.684
So I borrowed some money
from your teacher.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.521
It's not a big deal
when you're doing business.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.356
How dare you yell at me?

40:00.439 --> 40:01.899
-Please, Dad.
-Come out!

40:01.982 --> 40:03.567
-Come out, you bastard!
-I'm sorry!

40:03.651 --> 40:05.403
-Come out!
-I'm sorry!

40:05.486 --> 40:06.946
Come out! You bastard!

40:07.613 --> 40:09.198
Come out!

40:10.241 --> 40:11.826
Come out! You bastard!

40:11.909 --> 40:16.205
<i>Please, Dad. I'm sorry! Please stop!</i>

40:21.085 --> 40:22.753
I'm just worried.

40:24.380 --> 40:27.591
Because you're straying off the path
and you still insist on going that way!

40:35.599 --> 40:37.685
Children who suffer from domestic abuse

40:39.019 --> 40:40.855
never grow up
from that moment in their life.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.566
Ten years? Twenty years?

40:44.859 --> 40:47.445
Time will pass by,

40:48.279 --> 40:51.866
but they are just stuck in that time,
remaining as an abused child.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.247
Anyone can criticize juvenile offenders.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.125
However, it is only us judges

41:02.293 --> 41:03.836
that can give
these juveniles a second chance.

41:06.547 --> 41:09.884
That's why I believe the work we do
is more meaningful and important.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.142
The very reason why I became a judge.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.154
-Thirty minutes until the trial.
-Okay.

42:19.036 --> 42:21.372
What's wrong with this?

42:21.914 --> 42:23.332
The battery must be dead.

42:23.415 --> 42:25.000
I'll go get new ones.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.544
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.547
-You're getting sloppy.
-I'm sorry.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.304
Judge Cha. Are you okay? I'm sorry.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.556
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.432
-Judge Sim has her trial today, right?
-Yes.

42:40.516 --> 42:41.892
Go ahead. You'll be late.

42:41.976 --> 42:44.353
-Yes. I'm sorry.
-Wait…

42:45.104 --> 42:48.023
Is Yu-ri on trial today?

42:54.822 --> 42:56.907
The trial is now in session.

42:57.533 --> 43:00.202
<i>Wasn't Yu-ri standing trial
as a status offender?</i>

43:00.953 --> 43:03.080
Well, you're half right.

43:03.163 --> 43:06.709
The reason she was separated
wasn't to punish her.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.462
This trial will be held

43:10.546 --> 43:13.007
along with the child protection case
against Yu-ri's father,

43:13.090 --> 43:14.925
who has been taken into custody.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.885
With the power vested in me by the court,

43:16.969 --> 43:19.138
I order that the child's offender
be isolated from the child

43:20.139 --> 43:24.727
as per the Act on Special Cases Concerning
The Punishment of Child Abuse Crimes.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.230
-Mr. Seo.
-Yes.

43:29.064 --> 43:31.942
Do you know why you're here?

43:32.026 --> 43:32.860
Yes.

43:32.943 --> 43:34.403
Why are you here?

43:34.486 --> 43:36.488
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

43:37.239 --> 43:38.490
Domestic violence.

43:38.574 --> 43:39.783
Do you admit to the charges?

43:40.618 --> 43:43.370
I had to admit it
when I was under investigation,

43:43.454 --> 43:44.830
but it's preposterous.

43:44.913 --> 43:48.626
I was only parenting my child,
so who are you to order me around?

43:49.293 --> 43:50.628
What's the court done for me?

43:50.711 --> 43:53.005
What I did was discipline her.

43:53.088 --> 43:54.798
It's within my rights as her father.

44:05.059 --> 44:07.436
PHOTO EVIDENCE OF SEO YU-RI'S ABUSE

44:13.442 --> 44:16.528
To discipline means

44:16.612 --> 44:19.365
to give intellectual, moral,
and social guidance to someone.

44:23.327 --> 44:27.665
Is that what you call discipline?

44:28.707 --> 44:32.294
Something that was within your rights
as her father?

44:43.138 --> 44:45.099
There's only one reason
why I locked you up.

44:47.351 --> 44:48.602
To make you stand in court

44:50.854 --> 44:52.189
and to prove to you.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.817
The abuser getting locked up while

44:55.651 --> 44:57.903
the victim stays.

45:00.155 --> 45:01.698
To show you a reality

45:03.325 --> 45:05.077
where the victim gets to stay

45:08.163 --> 45:12.209
and the perpetrator gets punished.

45:15.337 --> 45:17.631
I'm being set up.

45:17.714 --> 45:20.175
Do you have proof I did that?

45:25.055 --> 45:29.226
This is the statement Ms. Seo Yu-ri gave
at the Juvenile Classification Center.

45:29.309 --> 45:32.312
In this statement, she writes that

45:32.396 --> 45:34.982
she was beaten with a bat and kicked.

45:35.524 --> 45:37.693
And, witness?

45:41.071 --> 45:42.865
I'm Detective Ko Gang-sik
from the Women & Juvenile Affairs Division

45:42.948 --> 45:43.824
at Yeonhwa Police Station.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.117
POLICE STATION

45:45.200 --> 45:47.119
What are you going to do with Seo Yu-ri?

45:47.995 --> 45:50.289
I dismissed the runaway report, but…

45:51.373 --> 45:52.624
What would you do?

45:52.708 --> 45:55.127
You already stopped her
from drowning once,

45:56.503 --> 45:57.838
so will you help her one more time?

45:57.921 --> 45:59.298
Would I be of help?

45:59.381 --> 46:01.675
Do you remember the state she was in
at the emergency room?

46:01.758 --> 46:02.843
Yes.

46:04.511 --> 46:06.763
I need you to accuse her father
of domestic abuse.

46:08.891 --> 46:12.644
I need you
to investigate this matter personally.

46:17.941 --> 46:20.861
This is a voice recording from the day
she was rushed to the ER.

46:20.944 --> 46:22.905
I found it while investigating
her domestic violence case.

46:27.618 --> 46:30.579
<i>-Where's the money?
-I don't have it!</i>

46:31.079 --> 46:34.500
<i>-I guess you need another beating then!
-Stop! Stop it!</i>

46:34.583 --> 46:37.002
<i>-I don't have it!
-I'm not asking for a lot of money!</i>

46:37.085 --> 46:38.462
<i>Go earn it yourself!</i>

46:39.546 --> 46:41.590
<i>I said, go earn it yourself!</i>

46:41.673 --> 46:43.759
<i>-Shut up!
-Stop!</i>

46:43.842 --> 46:45.719
<i>That's enough, you jerk!</i>

46:46.220 --> 46:47.137
<i>Where's the money?</i>

46:47.930 --> 46:49.348
<i>-Stop it!
-I don't have any!</i>

46:49.431 --> 46:51.767
-Keep talking.
-Oh gosh! Please!

46:51.850 --> 46:53.310
<i>-Stay still!
-Please! Stop!</i>

46:53.393 --> 46:54.311
<i>Fuck you!</i>

46:55.270 --> 46:56.522
<i>I said, fuck you!</i>

46:56.605 --> 46:58.315
<i>-I told you to stop!
-Stay out of this!</i>

47:00.442 --> 47:03.654
-Do you have a death wish?
-Stop it! That's enough!

47:03.737 --> 47:05.155
-Stop it!
-My goodness..

47:05.239 --> 47:06.657
-Grandma…
-Hey.

47:06.740 --> 47:09.535
Don't act like you're something because
you have a job. Where's the money?

47:09.618 --> 47:10.911
I don't have any!

47:10.994 --> 47:13.705
-Give me the money or you'll get it!
-I don't have any!

47:13.789 --> 47:15.040
Just kill me.

47:15.832 --> 47:19.127
-Just kill me now.
-Fuck. Kill you? Fine.

47:19.211 --> 47:20.879
-Just die!
-Stop it!

47:20.963 --> 47:23.048
Die, you bitch!

47:23.131 --> 47:25.884
-Stop it!
-Die!

47:26.885 --> 47:29.471
Try talking back now! Go on!

47:29.555 --> 47:30.389
Damn it!

47:30.472 --> 47:32.724
Goodness, my baby.

47:47.072 --> 47:47.906
Jeez.

47:47.990 --> 47:50.450
I was going to report her
when she ran away,

47:50.534 --> 47:52.327
but you stopped me from doing so.

47:52.411 --> 47:54.162
You were all in on it, weren't you?

47:55.080 --> 47:57.291
Who the hell are you? Are you even a cop?

47:57.374 --> 47:59.543
-Are you a cop? You bastard.
-That's enough!

47:59.626 --> 48:00.711
What?

48:01.336 --> 48:03.255
You'd better sit down.

48:05.299 --> 48:07.801
Gosh, this is nonsense.

48:08.969 --> 48:13.140
Your Honor. You must know she's a whore.

48:13.223 --> 48:15.267
She stood trial for it.

48:15.350 --> 48:18.312
So I beat her a little
to bring her back to her senses.

48:18.395 --> 48:20.731
I disciplined her as her father.

48:20.814 --> 48:22.107
What's so wrong with that?

48:32.909 --> 48:35.078
There's nothing wrong
with a little discipline.

48:54.514 --> 48:55.349
But…

48:56.600 --> 48:58.268
that's not discipline, is it?

49:05.525 --> 49:09.237
There's something I wanted to know…

49:11.073 --> 49:12.616
while proceeding with this trial.

49:14.201 --> 49:15.452
I just don't understand it.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.335
Why are you…

49:28.507 --> 49:30.175
so smug?

49:43.647 --> 49:46.692
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

49:49.444 --> 49:53.031
I failed to raise my son properly.

49:55.575 --> 49:57.494
Yu-ri's father, my son,

49:58.203 --> 49:59.996
is just like his dad.

50:00.872 --> 50:05.377
He was also abused at home
when he was growing up.

50:06.837 --> 50:09.673
Why are you giving this to us?

50:09.756 --> 50:12.008
I don't even know what that is.

50:13.135 --> 50:16.555
Yu-ri prepared it
to report him to the police.

50:17.305 --> 50:20.016
<i>I asked her not to.</i>

50:21.017 --> 50:24.688
I told her not to do it.

50:27.983 --> 50:30.694
How could she do that to her dad?

50:33.113 --> 50:35.782
I'm to blame.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.409
It's all my fault.

50:38.118 --> 50:42.748
It's because I didn't raise him well.

50:43.582 --> 50:46.585
I should be the one who's punished.

50:48.879 --> 50:50.255
So…

50:52.174 --> 50:53.884
you're the one who sold me out.

50:58.472 --> 51:00.223
What are you doing?

51:00.307 --> 51:02.267
-Grandma!
-Don't! Stop!

51:02.350 --> 51:03.769
-You crazy bastard!
-Shut up!

51:03.852 --> 51:04.978
Stop it!

51:06.605 --> 51:08.064
What do you think you're doing?

51:08.565 --> 51:10.066
-Let go of her!
-Shut the hell up!

51:10.150 --> 51:12.110
Let go of her!

51:13.403 --> 51:14.362
Please stop.

51:38.094 --> 51:39.012
Judge Cha!

53:01.887 --> 53:05.348
