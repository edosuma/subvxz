51:43.632 --> 51:46.166
"Seek first
the kingdom of God and his

righteousness and all these
things will be made unto you."

departure of Pastor Mike as a

will. He had bigger things in

hosts. If I will not open for

52:11.927 --> 52:14.795
you the windows of heaven and
pour you out a blessing."

Now I want you to pay attention
to that verse and see how the

52:17.233 --> 52:19.934

says, if you bring a seed to be

52:19.936 --> 52:24.572
sewn with your tithe. He in
return releases the blessings he

52:24.574 --> 52:26.574
has in store for you.
Can I hear an Amen?

plenty not in a Lord of

emptiness. Amen.

52:30.813 --> 52:32.012
Amen.

52:32.014 --> 52:34.615
In order to receive God's
blessing we must all be faithful

52:34.617 --> 52:37.650
to his promises. We all must sew
that seed when we open our

52:37.652 --> 52:40.387
hearts to bring forth
a blessing unto Him.
