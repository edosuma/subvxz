WEBVTT

00:00.327 --> 00:02.246
Previously on Burden of Truth...

00:02.296 --> 00:04.109
23 barrels in the field,

00:04.134 --> 00:06.001
and we still can't tie
it to Matheson Steel.

00:06.026 --> 00:07.451
But our whistleblower can.

00:07.476 --> 00:08.981
You want me to go on the record?

00:09.006 --> 00:10.631
Joanna said that we're not suing you.

00:10.656 --> 00:13.339
- We're suing the Mill.
- I am the Mill.

00:13.364 --> 00:14.782
We all have ends we gotta meet.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.265
You keep this conversation going,

00:16.291 --> 00:18.063
I'll show you where you meet your end.

00:19.005 --> 00:20.270
I don't understand.

00:21.198 --> 00:22.939
I have cancer?

00:23.185 --> 00:25.206
She said opposing counsel
called the meeting.

00:25.231 --> 00:26.527
If it wasn't you, then who did it?

00:26.551 --> 00:27.798
I did.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.261
Joanna Hanley is hereby disqualified.

00:31.301 --> 00:34.181
You've done a fabulous job
of getting us this far.

00:34.206 --> 00:35.323
I'll take it from here.

00:35.348 --> 00:36.486
That's unnecessary.

00:36.511 --> 00:37.894
I've got everything under control.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.310
Thanks, guys.

00:49.471 --> 00:50.820
What is going on?!

00:50.845 --> 00:52.813
Grab a box and get comfortable.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.682
What's all this?

00:55.391 --> 00:57.326
The Mill has been compelled
to show us their files,

00:57.350 --> 00:59.335
so they cooperate by burying us.

00:59.913 --> 01:01.673
I thought we were prepping Molly today.

01:01.756 --> 01:03.450
We are. We have to do both:

01:03.475 --> 01:05.647
Prep Molly and find the needle
in the haystack.

01:06.121 --> 01:07.704
Easy, right?

01:08.331 --> 01:10.364
If only we had our third musketeer.

01:10.473 --> 01:12.366
Shouldn't we have
heard from her by now?

01:12.548 --> 01:14.835
She'll reach out as soon
as she gets her ruling.

01:15.465 --> 01:16.826
So what's the needle?

01:16.864 --> 01:18.914
Anything relating
to the parent company:

01:18.939 --> 01:21.374
Email transcripts,
memos, board minutes.

01:21.616 --> 01:22.979
We have to show that P and L knew

01:23.004 --> 01:24.897
the illegal dumping was taking place.

01:26.652 --> 01:28.067
Are you kidding me?

01:28.126 --> 01:30.393
Yeah...
Anything that's been redacted,

01:30.418 --> 01:32.766
we have to petition the court
to have it unmasked.

01:33.054 --> 01:35.556
- Every time?
- Every time.

01:36.023 --> 01:37.887
Welcome to discovery.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.975 --> 01:50.747
Before me today is
the conflict of interest matter

01:50.772 --> 01:54.174
for the prosecuting attorney
of Ross v. Matheson Steel.

01:54.833 --> 01:56.112
Ms. Hanley, you better have

01:56.137 --> 01:58.226
one hell of an explanation
for yourself.

01:58.964 --> 02:00.787
During my time as lawyer at CTS,

02:00.812 --> 02:03.417
I did not work on Matheson Steel files,

02:03.646 --> 02:06.343
nor did I do any work
substantially related

02:06.368 --> 02:08.911
to the matter before the court.
There is no conflict.

02:09.443 --> 02:10.977
Furthermore, the Defence failed

02:11.002 --> 02:13.210
to bring their complaint
in a timely manner.

02:13.235 --> 02:14.502
By failing to bring their complaint,

02:14.526 --> 02:17.412
they have effectively
waived their objection.

02:17.599 --> 02:19.099
Use it or lose it.

02:19.854 --> 02:21.207
Counselor Hanley.

02:21.232 --> 02:22.745
Yes, Your Honour.

02:22.958 --> 02:25.025
Counselor David Hanley.

02:25.387 --> 02:27.735
Why the delay in bringing this
to my attention?

02:27.835 --> 02:30.470
I wasn't lead counsel
for the Defence until last week.

02:30.585 --> 02:33.587
But you knew your daughter
was representing Molly Ross.

02:35.671 --> 02:37.023
Yes, I did.

02:37.766 --> 02:40.120
By removing me
from this matter so late,

02:40.175 --> 02:42.448
it will negatively impact our client.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.465
They still have
Billy Crawford, Your Honour.

02:45.836 --> 02:47.491
Would your clients not be sufficiently

02:47.516 --> 02:49.201
represented by your cocounsel?

02:49.297 --> 02:51.431
William Crawford is a skilled attorney,

02:51.466 --> 02:53.191
but Carver, Thatcher, Stokes

02:53.216 --> 02:56.135
is a firm with enormous resources.

02:56.370 --> 02:58.739
Even with the two of us,
this isn't a fair fight.

02:59.067 --> 03:01.206
And the resources that we do have

03:01.231 --> 03:04.400
are being squandered
fighting vexatious motions.

03:08.109 --> 03:09.922
You're wasting Opposing Counsel's time

03:09.947 --> 03:11.948
and more importantly,
you're wasting mine.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.095
Joanna Hanley
is requalified as counsel.

03:20.829 --> 03:22.149
Well, well.

03:22.174 --> 03:25.477
Me and you back in court
together. Just like old times.

03:25.586 --> 03:28.963
I'm here because you had me
disqualified from this case.

03:29.057 --> 03:31.358
I've never given you special
treatment. You know that.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.763
I think that you are terrified

03:34.788 --> 03:36.889
of what the girls are going to say

03:37.063 --> 03:38.982
and you're trying to sideline
our witness preparation,

03:39.006 --> 03:40.460
and it's not gonna work.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.112
Joanna, I was really hoping

03:44.143 --> 03:47.413
that we could start
mending fences here.

03:47.493 --> 03:50.456
Come on.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.564
Will you at least
have breakfast with me?

03:54.781 --> 03:56.131
Please?

03:57.886 --> 04:00.288
We've always bonded over litigation.

04:00.649 --> 04:03.017
There's no reason we can't
do it from opposite sides.

04:03.757 --> 04:05.772
That's gonna be a long road, Dad.

04:06.612 --> 04:08.709
And right now, I'm kind of busy
with my girls.

04:09.491 --> 04:11.111
Your girls?

04:11.596 --> 04:12.987
Now you sound like Crawford.

04:13.012 --> 04:15.059
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means that he'll always be

04:15.083 --> 04:17.209
Molly Ross's uncle first.

04:17.385 --> 04:19.702
He's protective of her. He's emotional.

04:19.853 --> 04:21.260
That's why he'll lose.

04:21.497 --> 04:24.468
You think you can rattle Billy
by going after Molly?

04:33.686 --> 04:35.736
I should get going back to work.

04:36.416 --> 04:39.051
- I'll get this.
- You didn't finish.

04:39.861 --> 04:43.172
I'll see you
at the deposition tomorrow.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.731
Hey.

04:59.010 --> 05:01.228
Look, I know I'm not
your favourite person,

05:01.879 --> 05:04.298
but I was wondering if we could talk.

05:04.698 --> 05:06.465
About my father.

05:07.909 --> 05:10.744
I've been wanting to talk to you too.

05:16.732 --> 05:18.885
When I told him I was having Luna,

05:19.147 --> 05:21.348
your dad gave me an ultimatum.

05:23.177 --> 05:25.576
I had to agree
to never contact him again,

05:25.601 --> 05:27.796
or else he'd sue for full custody.

05:27.956 --> 05:29.584
He threatened to take her from you?

05:29.724 --> 05:31.133
He was bluffing.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.627
He had no interest in raising her,

05:32.651 --> 05:34.409
but I was a kid. I didn't know that.

05:36.651 --> 05:40.281
He told me that what you had together

05:40.362 --> 05:42.162
felt like love.

05:43.572 --> 05:45.639
I thought it was.

05:45.974 --> 05:47.739
I was young and infatuated,

05:47.764 --> 05:49.965
and he loved that.

05:51.587 --> 05:53.280
But that's not love.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.383
He's told so many lies.

05:57.088 --> 05:58.891
I just need to find the one

05:58.933 --> 06:00.598
that will trip him up.

06:01.322 --> 06:03.924
Is that why you wanted to talk to me?

06:04.556 --> 06:05.913
Ask your mother.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.740
I'm sure she has
enough dirt to bury him.

06:07.765 --> 06:10.075
Yeah, I haven't heard
from her in over a decade.

06:12.867 --> 06:15.202
She was supposed to come with us.

06:15.431 --> 06:18.079
She stayed back in Winnipeg
to finish packing, and...

06:19.366 --> 06:21.761
I never saw her again.

06:23.471 --> 06:25.405
Maybe you should find her.

06:26.908 --> 06:29.281
I mean, you know
where she is, don't you?

06:34.482 --> 06:36.288
I'll do what I can

06:36.313 --> 06:38.181
to help you take him down.

06:38.897 --> 06:40.660
But...

06:40.776 --> 06:43.273
the person you really need
to talk to is her.

06:54.876 --> 06:56.877
Your kids made these for me?

06:59.907 --> 07:01.842
I didn't tell them what happened.

07:01.923 --> 07:05.028
Yeah. And they don't know about us?

07:07.955 --> 07:09.829
How's the head?

07:10.104 --> 07:11.972
Still feels like

07:12.724 --> 07:14.646
the guy knocked something loose.

07:14.749 --> 07:16.317
Whatever it is it's just...

07:16.548 --> 07:18.114
rattling around in there.

07:18.351 --> 07:20.386
Who would do this?

07:21.643 --> 07:23.983
I keep replaying it in my head...

07:24.616 --> 07:27.441
but... my head's the problem.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.901
I can't remember anything.

07:32.787 --> 07:34.788
You should get some rest.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.369
I'll be back in a bit
to check on you, OK?

07:42.697 --> 07:44.631
Who the flowers for?

07:44.792 --> 07:47.060
You cheating on me
with some guy in a body cast?

07:47.973 --> 07:49.796
They're for Taylor Matheson.

07:50.068 --> 07:52.899
She's in the east wing,
first round of chemo.

07:53.569 --> 07:55.402
Give the kid my best, OK?

08:07.795 --> 08:09.763
Dr. Barrow to Obstectrics.

08:09.961 --> 08:11.461
Hey.

08:12.106 --> 08:14.074
Shh!

08:14.616 --> 08:16.122
How are you doing?

08:16.256 --> 08:18.458
Well, um, chemo sucks.

08:18.493 --> 08:20.432
Well, we should put that
on the back of a tshirt.

08:22.424 --> 08:24.258
Where's your mom?

08:24.599 --> 08:26.248
They're on a rotating schedule,

08:26.308 --> 08:28.542
which means I never get a break.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.777
They don't want you to be alone.

08:31.051 --> 08:33.553
And I'm always
still here if you need me.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.515
- Diane.
- Hi, Ben. Good morning.

08:42.946 --> 08:44.618
Baby, did you sleep?

08:44.901 --> 08:46.724
Yeah, when you weren't snoring.

08:46.781 --> 08:48.849
I don't snore.

08:49.016 --> 08:50.917
You must be hungry.

08:51.578 --> 08:53.105
How about I get you one of those

08:53.130 --> 08:54.685
tasty nutritional shakes?

08:54.849 --> 08:56.918
Said no one ever.

08:57.565 --> 08:59.933
Ms. Evans, can you take my dad
on a walk or something?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.901
He's been in that chair all night.

09:02.170 --> 09:03.815
I'm fine. You don't need
to worry about me.

09:03.839 --> 09:06.006
I'd also really like to get some sleep.

09:06.845 --> 09:08.175
Coffee?

09:08.542 --> 09:09.958
Yeah.

09:21.610 --> 09:25.322
We should start with named
plaintiff, Molly Ross.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.624
- She's the weak link.
- OK.

09:27.722 --> 09:29.503
She got some brain trauma
on the soccer field

09:29.528 --> 09:30.791
a couple years ago.

09:31.290 --> 09:32.855
A concussion.

09:33.338 --> 09:35.957
Yeah. Suffered traumatic brain injury

09:35.982 --> 09:37.916
that caused sufficient damage,

09:38.099 --> 09:41.167
enough to differentiate her
symptoms from the other girls.

09:41.215 --> 09:44.050
She only scored 10
on the Glasgow Coma Scale.

09:44.278 --> 09:46.613
Look, it's an opening, OK?

09:46.831 --> 09:48.606
We establish the brain injury,

09:48.642 --> 09:50.443
and then we pivot to the gay thing.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.628
- The gay thing?
- Yeah.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.520
Look, there are

09:56.590 --> 09:58.984
certain psychological pressures

09:59.009 --> 10:01.567
to being a closeted lesbian
in a small town.

10:02.187 --> 10:04.202
Stressors that may have

10:04.259 --> 10:07.027
exacerbated her earlier brain injury.

10:07.679 --> 10:09.059
Now, I think that we can

10:09.084 --> 10:11.775
comfortably argue
that Molly Ross was suffering

10:11.838 --> 10:13.524
prior brain impairment

10:13.601 --> 10:16.636
from her athletics
and her lifestyle choices.

10:17.078 --> 10:18.682
You know, I think we'd have better luck

10:18.707 --> 10:20.674
focusing on the admissibility

10:20.902 --> 10:23.003
of the medical evidence of causation.

10:23.902 --> 10:26.922
Right? We argue Fraser v. UT Trucking.

10:26.962 --> 10:28.735
This isn't a group grope, Alan.

10:28.823 --> 10:31.139
You just follow my strategy. OK?

10:31.899 --> 10:33.753
I just don't think that we should...

10:33.828 --> 10:36.029
target a young teenager
about her sexuality.

10:36.390 --> 10:38.258
It feels...

10:38.648 --> 10:39.894
unduly harsh.

10:40.008 --> 10:41.589
"Unduly harsh"?

10:41.776 --> 10:43.577
You're starting
to sound like my daughter.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.503
Alan, we're paid to win.

10:45.766 --> 10:48.000
Nothing else matters.

10:49.622 --> 10:51.193
Besides, we're not targeting

10:51.218 --> 10:52.794
Molly Ross with these strategies.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.621
We're going after her uncle. Crawford?

10:55.683 --> 10:57.203
Yeah.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.097
The harder we go after the niece,

10:59.122 --> 11:00.797
the deeper we get under his skin.

11:00.822 --> 11:02.255
He'll want to protect her.

11:02.717 --> 11:04.051
He'll push to settle.

11:04.105 --> 11:05.637
It's unnecessary, David.

11:07.725 --> 11:09.130
That weak stomach of yours

11:09.155 --> 11:10.842
is the reason that we
lost certification.

11:10.912 --> 11:12.611
They had a good case for certification.

11:12.636 --> 11:13.812
Nothing would've changed that,

11:13.836 --> 11:15.986
regardless of how many
girls we made cry.

11:16.011 --> 11:17.754
You should've had a better argument.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.470
You should've had
a better argument, Alan,

11:19.494 --> 11:22.015
instead of mooning over
the Opposing Counsel.

11:25.446 --> 11:27.414
You know what?

11:27.514 --> 11:31.117
Get out. Leave. You should go.

11:31.218 --> 11:34.076
Take a walk around the block.
Have a good cry.

11:34.182 --> 11:36.411
Do what you need to do. I don't care.

11:36.684 --> 11:38.041
But don't come back in here

11:38.092 --> 11:40.334
until you're ready to start
acting like a lawyer.

11:45.926 --> 11:48.455
And when did these symptoms
begin, Miss Ross?

11:48.603 --> 11:52.408
Uhm... I guess around
December of last year?

11:52.433 --> 11:55.262
All right. You wanna be
specific. December of last year.

11:55.566 --> 11:57.856
December of last year?

11:57.952 --> 11:59.274
No upspeak.

11:59.339 --> 12:01.243
You want me to change the way I talk?

12:01.295 --> 12:04.238
Look, if you sound uncertain,
they're gonna jump all over you.

12:05.299 --> 12:07.233
December of last year.

12:07.258 --> 12:09.585
Molly, come on! You gotta
take this seriously, OK?

12:09.610 --> 12:11.808
It's like there's something
wrong with everything I say.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.468
That's what prep is for.

12:13.861 --> 12:14.976
Look, you and the other girls,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.486
you just need to get
your stories straight.

12:16.510 --> 12:18.192
Yeah but aren't I even allowed to

12:18.217 --> 12:19.555
say things in my own way?

12:19.593 --> 12:22.228
Maybe it's time for a coffee break.

12:23.107 --> 12:24.290
All right.

12:24.358 --> 12:26.262
- Molly, take five.
- Yeah.

12:26.347 --> 12:28.481
I'm gonna take a walk.

12:33.054 --> 12:34.948
What is going on with her?

12:35.304 --> 12:37.183
She's sick of being sick.

12:43.443 --> 12:45.444
Crawford and Associates.

12:46.874 --> 12:48.711
What was that?

12:48.793 --> 12:50.176
Automated message.

12:50.649 --> 12:52.640
Remind me to pay the phone bill.

12:53.768 --> 12:55.471
Well, there she is.

12:55.522 --> 12:57.051
Welcome back. Congratulations

12:57.076 --> 12:58.664
on your reinstatement, Counselor.

12:58.689 --> 12:59.701
Thank you very much.

12:59.726 --> 13:01.022
All right. That's enough celebrating.

13:01.046 --> 13:02.418
Grab a box and get to work.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.283
I would've loved to see
the look on your dad's face

13:05.307 --> 13:06.957
when the judge ruled in our favour.

13:07.034 --> 13:10.043
Yeah... And I had an interesting
conversation afterward...

13:10.170 --> 13:11.744
with your mother.

13:11.913 --> 13:14.573
My mom? What did she say?

13:15.206 --> 13:17.027
She reminded me that we may have

13:17.052 --> 13:19.287
an ace in the hole
that we didn't think of.

13:19.446 --> 13:21.481
Well, that is exactly
what we need right now.

13:22.475 --> 13:24.504
I will be back by noon tomorrow.

13:24.735 --> 13:27.901
- Where are you going?
- To Winnipeg to see my mother.

13:28.644 --> 13:30.083
If they're going after Molly,

13:30.108 --> 13:31.156
then I'm going after him,

13:31.181 --> 13:32.902
and I need as much
ammunition as I can get.

13:32.927 --> 13:34.463
What is it specifically
that you're going

13:34.487 --> 13:36.052
to find there that we can't find here?

13:36.083 --> 13:38.462
My parents were still together
when he brokered the sale

13:38.487 --> 13:40.101
of Matheson Steel to P and L.

13:40.126 --> 13:41.308
She might be able to give me something

13:41.332 --> 13:42.653
to trap him with.

13:44.777 --> 13:45.985
OK.

13:46.057 --> 13:47.933
Go, just bring Luna with you.

13:48.014 --> 13:49.823
No, it's just a short trip.
I don't need any company.

13:49.847 --> 13:52.378
Joanna, you haven't seen
your mother in 15 years.

13:53.205 --> 13:55.094
It'll be good to have
someone there with you.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.996
Especially someone you trust.

13:57.922 --> 13:59.365
We can work in the car.

14:13.879 --> 14:15.846
It lives.

14:16.247 --> 14:19.583
- This is cute.
- What are you doing here?

14:24.902 --> 14:26.770
Hey, I know things got heated

14:26.837 --> 14:28.938
the last time we spoke.

14:29.989 --> 14:32.108
But I'm the one who found you.

14:33.066 --> 14:35.735
I got you to the hospital.

14:35.849 --> 14:37.650
I was the one holding up two fingers.

14:38.137 --> 14:39.846
Remember?

14:40.828 --> 14:42.544
And I got everyone
on the force out looking

14:42.569 --> 14:44.403
for the scumbag who did this.

14:48.919 --> 14:51.354
I don't wanna upset you, so I'll go.

14:53.107 --> 14:55.343
You heal up, OK?

14:57.122 --> 14:58.535
Everybody at work

14:58.568 --> 15:00.469
is pulling for you, buddy.

15:02.191 --> 15:03.677
Hey.

15:05.242 --> 15:08.478
Thanks for coming. Means a lot.

15:12.274 --> 15:13.703
Ms. Evans.

15:13.777 --> 15:16.245
Officer Mercer.
What are you doing here?

15:16.634 --> 15:18.980
Just... trying to get
to the bottom of this.

15:19.054 --> 15:21.946
Well, I'm sure Owen is
relieved you're on the case.

15:36.231 --> 15:37.765
Thanks.

15:56.717 --> 15:58.684
Do you think I should go see David?

15:58.877 --> 16:00.853
Well, that depends.

16:00.987 --> 16:03.889
What do you hope to get
from seeing him?

16:04.785 --> 16:06.392
I want to ask him how a person

16:06.417 --> 16:07.773
can have a daughter out in the world

16:07.797 --> 16:10.041
and not want to know
anything about her.

16:10.776 --> 16:14.145
You should ask my mom
that when you see her.

16:17.257 --> 16:19.030
If your mom's been in Winnipeg,

16:19.079 --> 16:21.438
in the same house all this time,

16:22.599 --> 16:24.844
why haven't you ever gone to see her?

16:25.065 --> 16:27.346
I've thought about it...

16:27.900 --> 16:30.016
more than a few times,

16:30.810 --> 16:32.572
but my mother has made it clear

16:32.597 --> 16:35.055
that she wants nothing
to do with me, and...

16:35.480 --> 16:37.915
I've made my peace with that.

16:39.119 --> 16:41.087
I don't need her anymore.

16:42.145 --> 16:43.435
I just need whatever she knows

16:43.460 --> 16:45.461
that will help us win this case.

16:46.967 --> 16:48.139
Thanks.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.155
Um, I need a minute.

17:22.721 --> 17:24.890
I'm sorry about before, at the diner.

17:25.271 --> 17:28.304
I was with my daughter,
and we were arguing.

17:29.471 --> 17:31.210
Yeah, well...

17:31.245 --> 17:33.779
you were always good at quick exits.

17:41.073 --> 17:42.421
How've you been?

17:44.391 --> 17:46.191
I didn't come here to catch up.

17:47.990 --> 17:49.529
OK.

17:50.384 --> 17:52.398
Then what do you want from me?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.175
Someone was mean to you.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.360
It took me a long time

17:59.385 --> 18:00.927
to figure that out,

18:01.240 --> 18:03.976
that people who were hurt hurt people.

18:05.138 --> 18:07.106
And I'm sorry about whatever happened

18:07.153 --> 18:08.445
that made you who you are,

18:08.470 --> 18:12.515
but people just don't do what you did.

18:15.916 --> 18:18.416
I don't know what to say.
What do you want me to say here?

18:18.498 --> 18:21.133
I came here to tell to let you
know that I'm fine.

18:21.728 --> 18:23.702
That Luna and I are fine.

18:23.757 --> 18:26.623
- Good.
- And I've tried so hard

18:26.673 --> 18:29.075
not to pass that pain
onto her. So it'll end.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.287
Good.

18:31.382 --> 18:33.525
I think that's good.

18:38.138 --> 18:39.604
Wow.

18:43.776 --> 18:45.611
Well...

18:46.224 --> 18:47.820
Goodbye, David.

19:02.563 --> 19:05.304
A basket of fries and a coffee.

19:05.623 --> 19:07.931
You should stop
for a proper meal, Counselor.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.511
I'm too busy.

19:09.703 --> 19:11.537
I would've thought you'd be too.

19:11.938 --> 19:13.906
I find myself at liberty today.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.934
Thank you.

19:16.183 --> 19:17.984
I ordered us some drinks.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.058
No thanks.

19:28.127 --> 19:30.629
How are you feeling
about the depositions tomorrow?

19:31.887 --> 19:33.733
Is this really your strategy?

19:33.820 --> 19:34.988
Buy me a drink,

19:35.013 --> 19:37.214
and then get me to spill
about the game plan?

19:38.595 --> 19:40.662
You're a good lawyer.

19:40.819 --> 19:43.136
I'm serious. You've surprised me
at every turn.

19:43.242 --> 19:45.243
I'm flattered.

19:48.006 --> 19:50.059
I quit CTS today.

19:51.204 --> 19:54.014
I'm off the case as of three
hours ago. I'm a free agent.

19:54.207 --> 19:56.041
Yeah?

19:56.409 --> 19:58.943
You decided not to get
out of town, just...

19:59.449 --> 20:02.434
hang out for one last
wild night at The Boot?

20:02.714 --> 20:04.782
Asking me about depositions?

20:09.723 --> 20:11.857
- Let me help you and Joanna.
- OK.

20:12.916 --> 20:14.598
David's gonna go after Molly.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.926
Yeah, I know how depositions work.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.774
No. He's going to flay Molly alive.

20:18.799 --> 20:21.601
He's going to grill her on her
mental state, her sex life.

20:22.022 --> 20:23.606
I'm sure you know the expression

20:23.631 --> 20:25.712
"a little bit nutty,
a little bit slutty"?

20:26.212 --> 20:27.754
Amazingly effective strategy

20:27.779 --> 20:29.548
when it comes to taking down
female plaintiffs.

20:29.572 --> 20:32.215
To what end? There won't be
a judge present.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.506
To get under your skin.

20:34.895 --> 20:36.588
He thinks that your connection
with your niece

20:36.612 --> 20:38.947
is a weakness to be exploited.

20:41.754 --> 20:43.755
Why are you telling me this?

20:46.673 --> 20:49.074
Something about those
Millwood girls, I guess...

20:50.531 --> 20:52.547
kryptonite for us
soulless Bay Street types.

20:52.572 --> 20:55.203
All right, so you want to help
us and risk being disbarred

20:55.228 --> 20:57.095
for the good of your soul?

20:57.696 --> 20:59.785
What better reason is there?

21:01.193 --> 21:02.936
Look, I know his moves.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.286
I know his game plan.
I know his strategy.

21:05.318 --> 21:06.879
Let me help you prep Molly
and the girls

21:06.904 --> 21:08.905
so that they are bulletproof.

21:22.996 --> 21:25.564
Hey, maybe we should've called.

21:26.211 --> 21:28.957
- Head off the awkward?
- There's no avoiding awkward.

21:29.446 --> 21:30.819
Joanna...

21:30.870 --> 21:33.238
you don't have to pretend
to be brave for me.

21:34.479 --> 21:36.779
I was pretending for me, actually.

21:51.522 --> 21:52.952
Hi.

22:03.647 --> 22:05.594
I'll go, put up some tea.

22:05.619 --> 22:06.967
We just need to ask you a few questions

22:06.991 --> 22:08.368
about the purchase of Matheson Steel.

22:08.392 --> 22:10.163
It's for an important case
we're working on.

22:10.244 --> 22:13.376
- If that's what you want.
- You and Dad

22:13.436 --> 22:15.516
were still together at the time
he brokered the deal?

22:16.626 --> 22:17.721
Um...

22:17.758 --> 22:19.759
I really do think better with tea.

22:20.526 --> 22:22.627
We'd love some tea.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.113
Don't get too cozy. We're here to work.

22:27.602 --> 22:28.918
You don't have to keep pretending

22:28.942 --> 22:31.221
like we're just here for work, Joanna.

22:31.376 --> 22:32.819
We are.

22:32.927 --> 22:36.073
I've got some fresh banana
bread. Would you like some?

22:36.173 --> 22:37.690
This is not gonna take long.

22:37.725 --> 22:40.098
Then we'll just get out of your hair.

22:44.724 --> 22:47.430
I didn't expect you to forgive me.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.551
I'll go get the tea.

23:07.279 --> 23:08.746
Officer Mercer.

23:08.897 --> 23:12.913
- Ms. Evans. We meet again.
- It's Diane. How's Kelsey?

23:13.731 --> 23:14.940
You know,

23:14.993 --> 23:16.754
you were always her favorite.

23:16.851 --> 23:18.419
I don't think she would
have gone away to school

23:18.443 --> 23:19.816
if it wasn't for you.

23:19.958 --> 23:21.936
Hey, you owe me a lot of money.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.505
May I sit?

23:29.849 --> 23:32.484
I was wondering about Owen's case.

23:33.714 --> 23:35.748
- What about it?
- Any leads?

23:36.968 --> 23:39.425
No... No, nothing yet.

23:40.364 --> 23:41.488
If only I'd showed up

23:41.522 --> 23:43.389
a few seconds earlier...

23:43.744 --> 23:45.160
What about the weapon that was used?

23:45.184 --> 23:46.669
A piece of pipe.

23:46.734 --> 23:49.795
It could've been found at any of
the industrial sites around here.

23:50.316 --> 23:52.117
No fingerprints.

23:53.115 --> 23:55.200
He doesn't remember
much about the attack.

23:55.281 --> 23:56.700
Yeah.

23:56.910 --> 23:59.512
Poor guy, seems like he got his
brains a bit scrambled there.

24:00.732 --> 24:02.461
Except seeing you.

24:05.399 --> 24:07.233
I'm just glad I found him.

24:10.231 --> 24:11.807
My students do that.

24:11.879 --> 24:14.247
- What's that?
- The knuckle cracking.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.399
It's nervous energy.

24:17.525 --> 24:18.949
Sometimes they drum their fingers.

24:18.974 --> 24:21.222
The girls fiddle with their jewelry.

24:22.439 --> 24:23.805
Nervous energy?

24:23.830 --> 24:25.654
You must notice that as a cop

24:25.766 --> 24:27.667
when you're interrogating people?

24:28.921 --> 24:30.661
Mostly I see it
when I'm getting some kind

24:30.686 --> 24:32.687
of 'dog ate my homework' story.

24:36.323 --> 24:39.291
How are those two little girls
of yours, Diane?

24:40.774 --> 24:42.306
Pardon?

24:42.454 --> 24:43.957
Your girls.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.952
You were nice enough to ask about...

24:46.145 --> 24:48.661
Kelsey, and I didn't return the favour.

24:51.744 --> 24:53.683
They're great, thanks.

24:53.853 --> 24:56.403
Yeah, I saw that...

24:56.496 --> 24:57.807
that get well soon card

24:57.832 --> 24:59.800
they left Owen.

25:01.074 --> 25:03.014
Awful sweet.

25:03.063 --> 25:04.897
He's a lucky man.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.492
Hope he appreciates that.

25:13.893 --> 25:16.079
You take care, Diane.

25:22.735 --> 25:23.991
Do you remember Dad talking about

25:24.015 --> 25:25.995
the Mathesons or the Steel
Mill going bankrupt?

25:26.199 --> 25:27.915
Vaguely. It was a long time ago.

25:27.975 --> 25:30.735
I know. You have to...
put yourself back there.

25:30.911 --> 25:32.692
I have spent the last 20 years

25:32.717 --> 25:34.618
trying to do the opposite.

25:35.122 --> 25:37.290
Look, I need to take
a little break now.

25:37.476 --> 25:39.411
Of course you can.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.409
So, how did the two of you
find each other?

25:44.817 --> 25:46.118
Joanna came to Millwood

25:46.143 --> 25:48.698
for a case and we started
working together

25:49.412 --> 25:51.290
without even knowing.

25:51.325 --> 25:52.820
I remember thinking

25:52.859 --> 25:54.347
how weird it was

25:54.482 --> 25:56.783
how much we'd hit it off.

25:57.237 --> 25:59.405
You're not angry?

26:01.094 --> 26:03.562
I'm just glad she's here now.

26:04.882 --> 26:07.085
I'm glad she's here now too.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.453
Then why didn't you come for me?

26:11.086 --> 26:13.362
Your father helped me immigrate.
He was my lawyer.

26:13.387 --> 26:15.513
He said he would have me deported.

26:16.416 --> 26:18.015
He told me to go away,

26:18.111 --> 26:20.524
or he'd throw everything he had at me...

26:20.871 --> 26:22.499
use the breakdown I had in Millwood

26:22.524 --> 26:25.432
to say I was unfit,
turn you against me.

26:27.340 --> 26:29.375
You lost me anyway.

26:30.477 --> 26:32.963
I've been in and out
of the hospital, Joanna.

26:33.386 --> 26:35.321
So much time had gone by,

26:35.395 --> 26:37.296
and I was so afraid.

26:38.452 --> 26:41.596
Mom, I thought you hated me.

26:43.383 --> 26:45.785
When things hurt you so much,

26:45.953 --> 26:48.221
you need to turn away after a while...

26:49.336 --> 26:51.003
just to live.

26:57.263 --> 26:59.419
My memory is so foggy.

26:59.700 --> 27:02.368
I don't think I'll be able
to help you win this case.

27:04.505 --> 27:05.904
It's OK.

27:12.779 --> 27:14.647
That's not why I'm here.

27:25.105 --> 27:27.840
So, the doctors kept you
overnight in hospital,

27:28.174 --> 27:29.972
- isn't that right Miss Ross?
- Yes...

27:29.997 --> 27:32.899
but I was released the next day.

27:32.924 --> 27:35.025
So you just wanna answer yes or no.

27:35.082 --> 27:36.983
You don't want to give him
excess ammunition.

27:37.457 --> 27:39.260
I'm just explaining what happened.

27:39.352 --> 27:41.620
Right, but you don't know
what he'll pounce on,

27:42.361 --> 27:44.056
so treat your answers like money

27:44.081 --> 27:45.881
and give nothing away for free.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.949
- Got it?
- Yeah.

27:48.154 --> 27:50.202
Now, your family doctor,

27:50.277 --> 27:51.930
Dr. Harper, what did he say?

27:52.029 --> 27:54.227
He said that I had a concussion,

27:54.252 --> 27:56.127
but I was fine in a week or so.

27:56.183 --> 27:58.811
But that's not what you
told your friends

27:58.979 --> 28:00.731
a month later, was it?

28:00.807 --> 28:02.942
What? I don't know.
I don't really remember.

28:02.967 --> 28:04.298
Well, let me help you, Miss Ross,

28:04.323 --> 28:07.368
'cause it's right here in one
of your social media accounts.

28:08.201 --> 28:10.171
"Looking for my headphones all day,

28:10.216 --> 28:12.375
"then I open the fridge
to get some juice,

28:12.400 --> 28:13.995
and what do you know!"

28:14.121 --> 28:17.818
Alongside a photograph of your
headphones in a refrigerator.

28:18.211 --> 28:20.579
Would you read what you
wrote next, Miss Ross?

28:22.722 --> 28:24.138
"But hey, it's not like I

28:24.163 --> 28:26.373
just got my brains knocked out
or anything."

28:27.543 --> 28:29.718
So, clearly you were experiencing

28:29.743 --> 28:32.040
cognitive difficulties
after the soccer injury

28:32.065 --> 28:34.681
that you neglected to report
to your doctor.

28:34.741 --> 28:37.388
- My God. I was kidding.
- No. I don't think that's fair.

28:37.483 --> 28:40.151
- Wouldn't you object to this?
- The gloves will be off

28:40.253 --> 28:42.198
and there won't be any judge
to appeal to.

28:42.261 --> 28:44.288
So they can go into our accounts?

28:44.712 --> 28:47.576
Ladies, CTS has no less
than three associates

28:47.601 --> 28:49.379
combing through all
your social media posts

28:49.404 --> 28:51.505
and internet searches as we speak.

28:52.052 --> 28:54.962
Anything can and will
be used against you.

28:54.987 --> 28:57.221
It is not a question of fair.

28:59.672 --> 29:01.570
Eating disorders...

29:02.002 --> 29:03.851
feeling depressed after
your mother died,

29:03.882 --> 29:05.450
it'll all come up because right now,

29:05.475 --> 29:06.717
you are on trial.

29:06.742 --> 29:08.065
None of that has anything to do

29:08.090 --> 29:09.435
with the fact that we're sick.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.484
Opposing Counsel will argue otherwise.

29:11.537 --> 29:12.795
And if he can't convince a judge,

29:12.819 --> 29:14.301
at least he might succeed

29:14.326 --> 29:16.471
in upsetting you enough
to say something stupid.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.823
Which is why you all need to stay calm.

29:19.045 --> 29:21.232
And be ready for anything.

29:21.541 --> 29:23.291
And be ready to throw it
back in his face.

29:23.316 --> 29:25.051
Yes, I had an eating disorder. So what?

29:25.076 --> 29:28.150
Yes, I'm on anxiety medication.
So what?

29:28.607 --> 29:29.902
If you know it's coming,

29:29.927 --> 29:31.922
he doesn't have
the power to ambush you.

29:31.978 --> 29:33.450
Miss Ross, I understand that you're

29:33.475 --> 29:35.196
in a lesbian relationship?

29:35.282 --> 29:36.474
So what?

29:39.284 --> 29:41.653
So what?

29:47.054 --> 29:49.610
I've set up the spare room
for you and Luna.

29:49.689 --> 29:51.578
You can head out in the morning.

29:51.678 --> 29:53.987
- Let me help with that.
- No, you've got work to do.

29:54.047 --> 29:57.216
The work will still be there.
I can take a break.

29:57.370 --> 29:59.338
Joanna...

30:00.372 --> 30:02.309
You'll come back?

30:03.917 --> 30:05.239
Yeah.

30:05.919 --> 30:07.310
I promise.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.195
Good morning. I brought you both

31:59.237 --> 32:01.672
a cup of Lucy's finest.
Breakfast of champions.

32:01.786 --> 32:03.448
Thank you.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.826
You didn't have to be here.

32:06.642 --> 32:08.847
I just wanted to come and say...

32:09.006 --> 32:10.312
give him hell today, Molly.

32:10.606 --> 32:12.729
You should be there with us.

32:13.068 --> 32:15.514
That would be a little awkward
for Alan considering...

32:15.548 --> 32:17.295
Actually no, it wouldn't.

32:17.381 --> 32:19.430
- I'll come.
- Are you sure?

32:20.739 --> 32:22.331
If David finds out what you did...

32:22.356 --> 32:24.424
I want him to find out.

32:24.529 --> 32:26.530
In fact, I want to be
the one to tell him.

32:38.157 --> 32:40.381
- Is there more of that?
- Fresh pot.

32:40.485 --> 32:42.486
I didn't know how you take it.

32:42.568 --> 32:44.535
I can do it.

32:47.339 --> 32:49.173
What's that?

32:50.265 --> 32:51.981
I didn't tell you yesterday.

32:52.006 --> 32:53.748
I didn't know if I could
trust you with it,

32:53.773 --> 32:56.089
but now I know that I have to.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.869
What are you talking about?

32:59.213 --> 33:01.605
After I left him, I...

33:01.801 --> 33:03.541
your father kept asking me

33:03.566 --> 33:05.476
to send him his things.

33:05.510 --> 33:08.206
He seemed... anxious in particular

33:08.231 --> 33:10.699
about this box,
so I kept it as insurance.

33:10.982 --> 33:12.960
- Insurance.
- In case he tried

33:12.985 --> 33:15.286
to make good on his threats.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.389
There's something in here
you need to see.

33:24.874 --> 33:26.567
This is from Alison Shepard.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.724
She used to work for your dad.

33:28.823 --> 33:30.851
She's the mayor of Millwood now.

33:34.866 --> 33:36.800
Mom, this is a love letter...

33:37.502 --> 33:38.903
Keep reading.

33:47.253 --> 33:50.388
- Alan.
- David.

33:52.477 --> 33:55.126
Counselor, shall we begin?

34:05.370 --> 34:06.910
Diane.

34:06.992 --> 34:08.960
I was just on my way to see Taylor.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.356
Well, she's sleeping.

34:12.809 --> 34:15.590
Uhm... I just decided to jump out

34:15.614 --> 34:17.916
and get some health food. Want some?

34:18.409 --> 34:20.518
- I'm good.
- Your loss.

34:22.324 --> 34:23.788
You seem better today.

34:24.550 --> 34:26.322
Well, I had some sleep.

34:26.358 --> 34:30.475
And we spoke to Taylor's
doctors this morning, and...

34:31.281 --> 34:33.404
the prognosis is good, so...

34:34.737 --> 34:38.202
- She is a tough kid.
- Yes, she is.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.103
Yeah, well...

34:40.230 --> 34:41.578
Thank you for...

34:41.668 --> 34:43.469
coming to visit so often.
I appreciate it.

34:43.764 --> 34:46.032
I'm doing double duty right now.

34:46.253 --> 34:48.545
I've got a friend laid up nearby.

34:49.438 --> 34:51.063
Officer Beckbie?

34:51.581 --> 34:53.864
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.

34:54.302 --> 34:56.232
- How is he?
- He's on the mend.

34:56.310 --> 34:57.822
Should be going home soon.

34:58.522 --> 35:00.839
- It's nervewracking though.
- What is?

35:00.932 --> 35:03.183
They haven't caught
the person who did it.

35:03.312 --> 35:04.633
Yeah...

35:04.816 --> 35:08.442
Confidentially, I think it
might be someone he works with.

35:10.391 --> 35:12.359
Like a... another cop?

35:13.011 --> 35:14.967
He was investigating some corruption

35:14.992 --> 35:17.593
right before he was attacked, so...

35:18.855 --> 35:20.744
maybe he got too close to it.

35:21.666 --> 35:23.214
Wow.

35:24.208 --> 35:26.778
Hard to believe something like that

35:26.803 --> 35:29.431
would be happening right here
in Millwood?

35:31.137 --> 35:34.773
Yes. It is hard to believe.

35:37.726 --> 35:39.697
I'm gonna go.

35:40.074 --> 35:41.587
Thanks again, Diane.

35:49.997 --> 35:51.752
It's like an electrical jolt

35:51.777 --> 35:54.586
shooting up my spine
that makes me flinch.

35:54.713 --> 35:55.948
And since December,

35:55.973 --> 35:57.815
the symptoms have been
getting more pronounced?

35:57.840 --> 36:00.458
Yes... I used to be
able to suppress them,

36:00.483 --> 36:03.314
but... now I can't.

36:03.522 --> 36:05.144
I've had severe seizures

36:05.169 --> 36:08.134
on two separate occasions and lately,

36:08.159 --> 36:10.461
I've had a lot
of trouble concentrating.

36:11.395 --> 36:12.679
And Molly, have you suffered

36:12.704 --> 36:15.213
any brain trauma previously?

36:15.774 --> 36:19.028
Yes... I was diagnosed
with a slight concussion

36:19.053 --> 36:21.758
when I was 16. That's all.

36:21.954 --> 36:25.217
Afterwards, the doctor said I was fine.
And I felt fine.

36:25.273 --> 36:27.941
And I could still do
all the things I can't do now.

36:28.012 --> 36:30.948
Tell me about those things
you can no longer do.

36:32.383 --> 36:34.184
I... can't

36:34.405 --> 36:36.506
swim or drive.

36:37.013 --> 36:39.016
I can't play sports.

36:39.128 --> 36:41.630
I've lost a scholarship, and...

36:42.537 --> 36:46.010
I've had to put off
university indefinitely.

36:47.677 --> 36:49.266
All right. Thank you, Molly.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.069
That's all I have. Counsel?

36:52.289 --> 36:54.157
Your witness.

36:57.354 --> 37:00.022
Thank you, Miss Ross. No questions.

37:00.197 --> 37:02.565
- We can turn off the camera.
- I'm sorry?

37:03.539 --> 37:05.162
I see no need to put these girls

37:05.187 --> 37:07.041
through the ringer any further.

37:07.206 --> 37:09.186
Well, that's very considerate of you.

37:10.538 --> 37:12.591
She's a sympathetic witness, Crawford.

37:12.616 --> 37:13.784
All those crushed dreams,

37:13.809 --> 37:15.765
there wouldn't be a
dry eye in the court.

37:15.923 --> 37:17.160
You know,

37:17.185 --> 37:19.987
you might actually have
a case against Matheson Steel.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.824
If you do, we'll just
file for bankruptcy.

37:23.101 --> 37:24.705
But you don't have
a case against P and L.

37:24.729 --> 37:26.697
- We're building one.
- Really?

37:27.426 --> 37:29.573
Well, let's see what you have.

37:30.489 --> 37:33.401
We're filing a motion
for summary judgment

37:33.426 --> 37:36.146
on your claims against P and L.

37:37.153 --> 37:38.476
If you don't have a case

37:38.501 --> 37:40.005
against the parent company,

37:40.179 --> 37:42.436
- then we're done.
- What does that mean?

37:42.540 --> 37:44.334
It means, Miss Ross, that very soon,

37:44.359 --> 37:47.361
we can all get back to our lives.

37:47.558 --> 37:49.335
Alan.

37:52.564 --> 37:54.120
OK. What is he talking about?

37:54.213 --> 37:57.551
- He knew what I was gonna do.
- Just tell me what's going on!

37:58.166 --> 38:00.304
All this time, he was
just keeping us busy.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.525
It was an ambush.

38:14.973 --> 38:16.941
Hey. You OK?

38:16.975 --> 38:19.207
I am doing what's required.

38:19.497 --> 38:21.285
I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

38:21.358 --> 38:22.454
But listen, I have...

38:22.479 --> 38:24.047
There's nothing you could've done.

38:24.072 --> 38:26.507
He had us dancing
like a couple of puppets.

38:26.665 --> 38:28.273
"Us"?

38:28.543 --> 38:30.978
- Yeah. Alan switched sides.
- What?

38:31.479 --> 38:33.369
He helped me prep the girls.

38:33.602 --> 38:35.023
And he told me the exact same thing

38:35.063 --> 38:36.911
you said about David going after Molly.

38:36.974 --> 38:38.265
He told you the same thing

38:38.290 --> 38:40.139
because that's what my father
sent him to do.

38:40.164 --> 38:42.450
I had no idea what he was planning.

38:42.475 --> 38:43.575
He played me too.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.358
- Give me a break.
- He must've known I was gonna mutiny

38:46.383 --> 38:47.441
and he used it against me.

38:47.466 --> 38:51.956
"Mutiny"? So you torpedoed your career

38:51.981 --> 38:53.915
because of a grudge against my dad?

38:54.571 --> 38:56.261
No, it was...

38:56.867 --> 38:59.236
more than that.

39:00.756 --> 39:03.257
Anyway...
the motion hearing's in a week.

39:03.751 --> 39:06.519
We have to win that
or we lose the entire case.

39:07.921 --> 39:09.861
How was your trip?

39:22.638 --> 39:25.192
Don't even think about it.

39:28.113 --> 39:29.512
God, I was hoping someone

39:29.537 --> 39:31.527
would come along and do that.

39:34.457 --> 39:37.625
Wow. What's the occasion?

39:38.869 --> 39:40.670
Life is short.

39:40.792 --> 39:42.755
And good people like
Officer Owen Beckbie

39:42.780 --> 39:45.369
deserve a little special
consideration now and then.

39:50.246 --> 39:52.681
Something about you being in here,

39:52.738 --> 39:55.730
Taylor upstairs, her parents worrying
about...

39:55.755 --> 39:57.494
losing their daughter.

39:57.665 --> 39:59.120
Hey.

39:59.706 --> 40:02.246
I'm not going anywhere.

40:03.349 --> 40:05.250
I think I know who attacked you,

40:05.714 --> 40:07.514
but I don't have any proof.

40:09.038 --> 40:10.549
Tell me.

40:10.964 --> 40:12.419
Sam Mercer,

40:12.972 --> 40:16.207
maybe on the orders of Ben Matheson.

40:17.726 --> 40:19.829
I'm so sorry.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.558
Let's not talk about it right now.

40:29.457 --> 40:30.642
OK?

40:30.735 --> 40:33.236
You should try and eat something.

40:38.407 --> 40:40.885
You are so good.

40:42.776 --> 40:45.912
Hey, I was thinking
about those kids of yours.

40:47.123 --> 40:48.910
When I get out of here,

40:49.020 --> 40:50.554
maybe...

40:50.618 --> 40:52.205
I could thank them for...

40:52.267 --> 40:55.791
the get well soon cards... in person.

40:57.459 --> 40:59.826
Or we can talk about it another time.

40:59.851 --> 41:02.018
- It's just...
- No, sorry.

41:02.199 --> 41:04.334
I would love you to meet them.

41:05.482 --> 41:07.411
But I'm unsafe to be around right now.

41:07.446 --> 41:09.533
- I get it.
- That's not it.

41:09.670 --> 41:11.191
It's just...

41:12.971 --> 41:14.432
Do you remember when you told me

41:14.457 --> 41:16.091
that you came to Millwood
because you hoped

41:16.115 --> 41:17.363
it would be better?

41:17.506 --> 41:19.409
But then people like
Mercer made you realize

41:19.434 --> 41:20.794
it was just more of the same?

41:20.882 --> 41:23.517
Yeah, but... I love this town.

41:24.522 --> 41:25.834
I mean...

41:26.190 --> 41:29.559
all my favourite people are here.

41:32.238 --> 41:35.474
So maybe the place is less
important than the people.

41:40.561 --> 41:43.020
Derek's been offered a job in Winnipeg.

41:43.983 --> 41:46.029
It's good money, and...

41:46.421 --> 41:49.927
the girls
need to be close to their dad.

41:51.592 --> 41:53.177
Yeah.

41:54.278 --> 41:56.024
It looks like I might be moving.

42:10.090 --> 42:12.358
What're you gonna do when you
get back to Toronto?

42:12.511 --> 42:14.746
It's not like you can
ask my dad for a reference.

42:15.542 --> 42:17.017
You know, I'm thinking I might take

42:17.042 --> 42:19.115
a break from the law for a while,

42:19.420 --> 42:21.076
and...

42:21.174 --> 42:22.928
travel or...

42:23.074 --> 42:26.351
I don't know... learn piano.

42:28.456 --> 42:31.137
Thank you for what you tried
to do for us today.

42:31.469 --> 42:33.050
You know, doing
the right thing turns out

42:33.074 --> 42:34.902
to be a lot harder than it looks.

42:35.066 --> 42:37.160
Yeah, it takes a while
to get the hang of it.

42:37.206 --> 42:38.998
Trust me, I know.

42:39.065 --> 42:41.464
Well... you make it look pretty easy.

42:41.676 --> 42:44.686
For a lawyer, you are a terrible liar.

42:47.013 --> 42:48.969
When do you leave tomorrow?

42:49.122 --> 42:51.090
Bright and early.

42:51.220 --> 42:53.643
This time tomorrow,
the office will be packed.

42:56.117 --> 42:57.256
How about you? What are you gonna do

42:57.280 --> 42:59.816
with that letter from Mayor Shepard?

43:01.667 --> 43:02.972
I don't know if I can deal with

43:02.997 --> 43:04.738
another skeleton from his past.

43:04.895 --> 43:06.623
Even if it can win you the case?

43:06.724 --> 43:09.126
That used to be enough.

43:10.414 --> 43:13.283
Well... whatever you decide,
you'll be brilliant.

43:14.904 --> 43:16.281
Thank you.

43:25.643 --> 43:27.519
Kick his ass.

43:36.036 --> 43:40.036
