02:26.120 --> 02:27.580
Evening, Dr. Kessler.

02:44.850 --> 02:46.100
Front desk.

02:47.270 --> 02:48.440
Yes, ma'am.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.400
Well, we'll certainly check it out.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.110
- Yes, right away.
- Problem, Lyle?

02:58.700 --> 03:00.280
Miss Wells in 413.

03:00.910 --> 03:04.200
She claims that there are some animal
noises coming from the room next door.

03:04.410 --> 03:06.250
She thinks it might be a dog.

03:06.870 --> 03:10.080
- She says it's keeping her awake.
- Are you going to check it out?

03:11.290 --> 03:13.210
That's Dr. Kessler's room.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.800
You know how he feels about people going
into his room when he's not in there.

03:17.760 --> 03:18.720
The man hasn't had...

03:18.880 --> 03:21.640
The man is a weirdo, Lyle,
and a troublemaker.

03:21.800 --> 03:26.350
And if he is keeping an animal,
he'll be out on the street before morning.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.170
Damn.

04:14.270 --> 04:16.190
Oh, God!

04:55.020 --> 04:57.060
Let me out.

04:58.650 --> 04:59.650
Good God!

05:01.110 --> 05:02.110
It's a child!

05:18.250 --> 05:20.380
Lyle, it's me.

05:21.090 --> 05:22.420
Call the police.

05:24.130 --> 05:25.380
Just do it.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.520
Hello?

07:41.770 --> 07:42.900
Richard?

07:43.110 --> 07:44.730
Hi, I'm not here right now.

07:44.940 --> 07:46.940
So after the beep, leave your name,

07:47.110 --> 07:50.570
number, and a brief message and
I'll try and get back to you. Thanks.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.240
Hello, Richard. It's me, Virginia.

07:53.450 --> 07:54.320
Um...

07:54.530 --> 07:58.500
Well, I just thought maybe you'd like
to come over for a beer or something.

07:58.660 --> 08:01.420
I thought maybe you'd be home but...

08:04.000 --> 08:05.290
I'll be up for a while.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.800
So if you get home before...

08:07.960 --> 08:10.920
you know, too late,
just give me a call, okay?

08:13.390 --> 08:14.760
And, um...

08:28.190 --> 08:29.990
Ow.

10:04.660 --> 10:05.710
Who is it?

10:06.170 --> 10:07.670
Police. Open up.

10:08.590 --> 10:11.090
Richard. Come on up.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.160
Hi.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.750
Hi.

10:58.550 --> 10:59.720
Are you okay?

11:00.510 --> 11:02.010
Yeah, why?

11:05.520 --> 11:08.690
You sounded a little
agitated on the phone.

11:11.230 --> 11:12.480
No.

11:12.860 --> 11:14.690
That was just my phone voice.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.110
Can I get you a beer or something?

11:20.870 --> 11:22.570
Yeah, I'd love a cold beer.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.830
Then why don't you just go sit in there
and I'll go get it for you.

11:43.850 --> 11:46.220
"Much of Madness, More of Sin"?

11:49.350 --> 11:52.440
"Tortured and ridiculed by
the scientific establishment

11:52.610 --> 11:56.230
"for his investigations into the
creation of superior life forms,

11:56.480 --> 12:00.700
"noted zoologist Dr. Alan Kessler
continues his experiments

12:00.860 --> 12:03.450
"in the cloaked secrecy
of his basement laboratory.

12:03.620 --> 12:06.080
"Finally, after years of
failure and frustration

12:06.240 --> 12:09.830
"he manages to successfully mate
his own seed with an egg excised

12:10.210 --> 12:12.040
"from the ovaries of a jackal,

"and plants it in the womb of
an unwitting human surrogate."

12:15.630 --> 12:17.210
A little light reading, honey?

12:19.010 --> 12:20.470
So what, scared yourself again

12:20.680 --> 12:24.850
and lured me over with a cold beer
so you wouldn't have to be alone?

12:25.050 --> 12:25.970
You caught me.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.220
Honey, how can you read this crap?

12:28.430 --> 12:30.680
I don't know. It's some thing....

12:30.890 --> 12:34.940
It's like potato chips, I just can't stop.

12:40.450 --> 12:41.950
Potato chips?

12:44.780 --> 12:47.620
I don't know, this one was different.
It was really special.

12:47.790 --> 12:49.660
- Very well written.
- I'll bet.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.660
So, um...

12:54.380 --> 12:55.540
What happens?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.960
- With what?
- The book.

12:58.340 --> 12:59.630
How does it end?

13:00.300 --> 13:02.880
The surrogate dies in delivery.

13:03.760 --> 13:08.310
Dr. Kessler has to raise
the creature as his own son,

13:08.510 --> 13:12.060
but it's an evil, it's a wild thing.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.190
And he can't control it.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.020
I know the feeling.

13:17.940 --> 13:21.230
So... One night, somebody...

13:22.700 --> 13:24.700
lets the jackal boy escape.

13:25.490 --> 13:29.950
And Dr. Kessler goes out looking
for it and he hunts it down.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.370
Corners it in an alley.

13:33.660 --> 13:36.370
And he begs it to come home with him.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.170
But it hates him.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.420
It hates him for bringing it
into this world.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.960
It turns...

13:44.970 --> 13:48.550
and it leaps, and screaming in agony...

15:08.130 --> 15:09.840
Hell, I don't see what the problem is.

15:10.050 --> 15:12.850
It's not like he asked you
to marry him or anything.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.930
- Yeah, well...
- Excuse me.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.690
We've only been seeing
each other for six weeks.

15:19.850 --> 15:23.520
He already wants me to meet
his parents over Christmas.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.230
Crimson Falls, Ohio.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.780
I don't know, sounds like
a pre-proposal to me.

15:29.950 --> 15:31.160
Pre-proposal?

15:31.780 --> 15:32.950
Excuse me.

15:33.830 --> 15:35.450
I think I'll take these.

15:39.330 --> 15:42.580
All I know is if I had a guy
like Richard on the line...

15:42.880 --> 15:44.170
I'd reel him in.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.880
Yeah, I can see you
in a muumuu and curlers...

15:48.380 --> 15:50.430
scrambling up eggs for your husband.

15:50.590 --> 15:51.760
You don't know it, girl,

15:51.970 --> 15:54.720
but deep down underneath all
this chic cosmopolitan savvy

15:54.890 --> 15:57.350
beats the heart of a submissive hausfrau.

15:58.310 --> 16:01.690
Well, Richard's really special,
but I think I'll just take it slow.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.810
All I'm saying is if I had Mr. Right...

16:03.980 --> 16:06.520
I'd be home packing my bags
for Crimson Falls.

16:06.690 --> 16:10.280
You're sure not gonna meet him
putting in 14 hours a day at this dump.

16:10.450 --> 16:14.030
Maybe not. But I'm more likely
to run into a gorgeous guy

16:14.200 --> 16:16.950
in a bookstore than a
smart guy in a singles bar.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.620
Hi, Mona!

16:21.170 --> 16:22.210
Hi.

16:22.420 --> 16:25.170
Well, then again,
I could just kill myself.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.130
What the hell are you looking for?

16:33.180 --> 16:36.430
I'm looking for this book
called I, Madman.

16:37.140 --> 16:40.270
I've been looking for it everywhere
but I can't find it.

16:42.350 --> 16:44.900
It's by this guy.
His name is Malcolm Brand.

16:45.650 --> 16:46.900
Oh, that's charming.

16:47.110 --> 16:49.400
No, don't knock it, it's really good.

16:50.570 --> 16:51.530
It's horrific.

16:51.740 --> 16:55.160
It makes Stephen King read like
Mother Goose, but it's passionate.

16:55.660 --> 16:57.160
It's sort of like Poe.

16:57.580 --> 17:00.620
- I never heard of him.
- I hadn't either until yesterday.

17:01.580 --> 17:05.420
He wrote two of them, this one,
and one called I, Madman...

17:07.170 --> 17:10.670
which came in with the estate sale. Crap!

17:14.050 --> 17:16.970
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs to have another look.

17:17.180 --> 17:21.599
You sure are spending a lot of time trying
to find something called I, Madman.

19:20.970 --> 19:23.560
- You find it?
- No, I didn't.

19:23.810 --> 19:25.640
Well, maybe somebody bought it.

19:28.190 --> 19:29.390
Yeah, maybe.

19:31.900 --> 19:36.360
Aye, his mouth is stopp'd;
Honest lago hath ta'en order for't.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.570
He is dead, my lord?

19:38.740 --> 19:43.160
Had all his hairs been lives, my great
revenge had stomach for them all.

19:44.370 --> 19:47.200
Alas! He is betray'd, and I undone.

19:47.410 --> 19:48.450
Out, strumpet!

19:48.620 --> 19:50.290
Weep'st thou for him to my face?

19:50.500 --> 19:52.540
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

19:53.170 --> 19:54.340
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:54.550 --> 19:57.130
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, well, you didn't miss much.

19:57.300 --> 20:00.300
- Yeah, I can see that. Did he call us?
- No.

20:00.470 --> 20:03.220
- Being done, there is no pause.
- But whilst I say one prayer!

20:03.390 --> 20:05.470
It is too late.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.060
I know about 20 people
who'd like to do that.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.390
No, Collette's all right.

20:11.850 --> 20:13.100
Any comments?

20:13.270 --> 20:14.650
- No.
- Bravo!

20:14.860 --> 20:17.070
Collette, Michael, very good work.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.740
Incidentally our own
Ms. Berkowitz is going to star

20:19.950 --> 20:21.490
in a new made-for-television movie:

20:21.660 --> 20:23.030
No More Yesterdays.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.120
Congratulations.

20:28.830 --> 20:32.120
You should have gotten that part,
you're absolutely perfect for it.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.960
- Come on, Lenny.
- No, really. Perfect.

20:35.170 --> 20:36.290
No.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.920
Collette's really talented
and very beautiful.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.170
So are you.

20:41.590 --> 20:42.720
I hate her.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.060
How about dinner?

20:47.260 --> 20:49.180
We'll talk about her behind her back.

20:49.850 --> 20:52.190
No, I can't. I have plans with Richard.

20:52.650 --> 20:53.810
Oh.

20:55.730 --> 20:59.030
- Getting serious, huh?
- Maybe.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.780
Okay, we'll take one more couple.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.950
Kelly and Martin, please.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.030
- All right!
- We're off the hook!

21:07.200 --> 21:08.330
Look at this.

21:08.830 --> 21:10.370
We're not going to get to do our Cyrano.

21:10.580 --> 21:12.540
I bought a new nose and everything.

22:14.270 --> 22:15.270
Hi, it's Rich.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.100
Something came up here.
I pulled a narcotics stakeout.

22:18.310 --> 22:21.270
So I'm going to have to pass on dinner.

22:21.650 --> 22:24.940
I'll try and stop by afterwards,
but if it's late, well, I'll call.

22:26.030 --> 22:27.860
I miss you and I love you, honey.

22:28.070 --> 22:29.240
Goodbye.

22:31.290 --> 22:32.790
Oh, Mona!

24:41.790 --> 24:45.880
Hello, Anna. It's been a long time.

24:46.340 --> 24:47.670
Stay away from me.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.670
But I fixed it, Anna.

24:50.380 --> 24:51.670
What do you mean?

24:51.930 --> 24:54.550
Look. A clean slate.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.180
And a fresh palate.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.120
Jesus!

26:03.580 --> 26:05.040
What are you doing?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.120
I was just...

26:09.000 --> 26:10.550
making a fire, and I...

26:12.260 --> 26:13.550
I heard a noise.

26:13.760 --> 26:14.800
Yeah, I knocked.

26:15.010 --> 26:17.890
Honey, you've got to keep
your front door locked.

26:18.390 --> 26:19.930
Something on the stove?

26:22.020 --> 26:23.930
Oh, yes, I...

26:25.850 --> 26:27.350
I was making some tea.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.120
Great.

27:13.730 --> 27:14.780
You okay?

27:17.240 --> 27:19.320
Yeah. Why?

27:22.450 --> 27:23.620
I don't know.

27:24.830 --> 27:26.200
I just...

27:26.830 --> 27:29.960
You just seemed to be
away there for a while.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.750
I'm sorry, I...

27:36.920 --> 27:38.670
How much do you love me, Richard?

27:42.140 --> 27:43.800
On a scale of 1 to 10?

27:46.390 --> 27:47.520
20.

27:50.060 --> 27:51.770
Enough to cut off your ear?

27:52.440 --> 27:53.480
No.

27:55.650 --> 27:56.730
Yes. I don't know.

27:56.940 --> 27:59.400
What kind of an idiotic question is that?

27:59.660 --> 28:01.610
It's just this book I'm reading.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.580
This guy, he's a poet.

28:06.910 --> 28:10.250
He's a doctor, really,
but he sort of dropped out.

28:10.460 --> 28:14.380
Anyway, he's madly in love with
this actress named Anna Templer.

28:15.550 --> 28:19.170
She won't have anything to do with him
because she thinks he's really ugly.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.090
She just can't get past it.

28:21.390 --> 28:24.180
So he cuts off his ear?

28:24.430 --> 28:27.260
It's totally hopeless.
He's desperate to please her.

28:27.470 --> 28:30.140
Then one night he's been drinking heavily.

28:30.350 --> 28:33.940
You'd have to be more than just
insane to have these thoughts.

28:34.730 --> 28:38.400
He goes into his closet digging
around for his old medical bag.

28:38.820 --> 28:41.740
He finds it, takes it out,
over to a mirror.

28:42.200 --> 28:45.700
He pumps his face full of Novocaine,
and then, with his scalpel

28:45.910 --> 28:49.040
begins to slice away
his features one by one.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.210
And he's crazed with love!

28:51.460 --> 28:53.080
So he slices off his face?

28:53.710 --> 28:57.040
Great! The guy's never heard
of a candygram or flowers?

28:57.880 --> 28:59.550
It's only a book, Richard.

29:00.630 --> 29:02.170
It gives me the creeps.

29:03.010 --> 29:05.180
Okay, we won't talk about it anymore.

29:05.430 --> 29:08.470
You know, you always get weird
when you read that shit.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.310
But, uh...

29:14.690 --> 29:16.770
If it'll make you feel any better...

29:17.070 --> 29:18.900
first thing after breakfast...

29:20.150 --> 29:22.360
I'll cut myself shaving.

29:23.950 --> 29:24.990
Come here.

29:28.580 --> 29:30.290
That's really sweet of you.

30:11.450 --> 30:16.420
I stood in the shadow of an alley,
watching and waiting.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.050
Watching and waiting for that special one.

30:22.460 --> 30:25.670
It had to be a woman's.
I knew that for sure.

30:26.800 --> 30:30.930
Only she spends the time
caring and cultivating...

30:31.970 --> 30:35.060
and combing the silken crown.

30:36.190 --> 30:41.230
A downy frame around a painting
as beautiful as the portrait itself.

30:43.900 --> 30:45.490
They were all out.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.910
The jet-blacks.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.990
The mousy browns.

31:00.170 --> 31:01.590
The bleached blondes.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.090
But none was right...

31:10.550 --> 31:13.810
until Red came along.

31:22.570 --> 31:24.320
Good old Red.

31:24.820 --> 31:26.400
It was perfection.

31:28.910 --> 31:32.870
Soft as cloud and brilliant as sun.

31:33.540 --> 31:37.250
Her flaming crimson torch of feathers.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.630
Ready and ripe for easy picking.

33:20.640 --> 33:21.730
Oh, my God!

33:29.530 --> 33:31.440
Can't somebody call the police?

34:09.940 --> 34:10.940
Please....

34:12.989 --> 34:17.199
Just a little something to help you sleep.

34:33.920 --> 34:34.969
Now...

34:36.719 --> 34:40.800
I would like you to count
backwards slowly from 100.

34:42.719 --> 34:43.889
99.

34:45.770 --> 34:46.940
98.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.730
97.

34:53.150 --> 34:54.360
96.

34:56.199 --> 34:57.400
95.

34:59.620 --> 35:00.740
94.

35:03.330 --> 35:04.500
93.

35:06.460 --> 35:07.580
92.

35:09.420 --> 35:10.540
91.

35:13.170 --> 35:14.300
90.

35:16.630 --> 35:17.720
89.

35:19.430 --> 35:20.550
88.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.390
87.

35:26.140 --> 35:27.430
86.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.610
85.

35:40.490 --> 35:41.570
82.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.410
81.

35:46.540 --> 35:47.660
80.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.600
You like the color, Anna?

37:34.770 --> 37:36.940
Miss? Are you getting on or what?

38:21.280 --> 38:22.480
Jesus Christ, Mona!

38:22.690 --> 38:23.860
I'm sorry.

38:24.070 --> 38:25.990
I thought he was in the back with me.

38:26.990 --> 38:29.410
He scared the shit out of me.
Where did that cat come from?

38:29.620 --> 38:32.740
I found him. I figured we could
keep him here. He's mouse patrol.

38:32.950 --> 38:35.210
- Oh, God.
- Boy, are you jumpy.

38:36.460 --> 38:40.000
What are you doing here? I thought
you weren't coming to work till 4:00 today.

38:40.210 --> 38:44.510
Oh, God, the book.
First edition Hemingway.

38:46.090 --> 38:48.840
Old lady Vettey came in
yesterday after you left.

38:49.050 --> 38:52.600
She had a shit-fit when she saw
that stuff hadn't been unpacked yet.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.480
- What stuff?
- You know, that stuff upstairs.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.270
The estate sale shipment.

38:58.270 --> 38:59.440
Oh, yeah.

38:59.940 --> 39:01.320
I'll clean this up.

39:02.190 --> 39:04.780
Okay, I'll unpack the stuff.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.920
"Malcolm Brand"?

39:48.530 --> 39:49.950
"Malcolm Brand."

40:08.420 --> 40:11.390
Yuck, who'd want to buy a used sex manual?

40:12.550 --> 40:14.470
Mona, where did you find this book?

40:14.680 --> 40:16.060
What are you talking about?

40:17.930 --> 40:19.940
Didn't you leave this
outside my door last night?

40:20.140 --> 40:22.310
This is the book you're
looking for, right?

40:23.770 --> 40:25.400
Well, I didn't find it.

40:53.800 --> 40:56.640
- Yeah, Channing's desk.
- Detective Channing, please.

40:56.890 --> 41:00.060
- He's not in.
- Hi, this is Virginia Clayton.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.890
I called before.
I'm a friend of Richard's.

41:03.730 --> 41:05.360
- Is he back yet?
- No.

41:05.940 --> 41:08.690
But I gave him your message
about a half-hour ago.

41:09.740 --> 41:12.700
I know. But it's very important
that he calls me back.

41:13.660 --> 41:17.410
All I can do is give it to him again.
I'm sure he'll call you back.

41:17.740 --> 41:19.540
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay.

41:19.830 --> 41:22.250
Have him call me back as soon as possible.

41:22.460 --> 41:23.460
Okay.

41:59.160 --> 42:02.330
...completely bald.
A chrome dome, a cue ball.

42:02.540 --> 42:04.210
But just look at these results!

42:04.370 --> 42:08.210
With daily applications of our
advanced formula, hair growth...

43:21.450 --> 43:22.740
Do you like the music?

43:30.380 --> 43:32.210
Why are you doing this to me?

43:36.800 --> 43:37.840
Lovely.

43:39.390 --> 43:42.300
Please... leave me alone.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.060
You'll come around, Anna.

43:45.270 --> 43:47.100
You will love me.

43:47.270 --> 43:50.850
No, I don't love you. I'll never love you!

43:52.610 --> 43:54.900
You can't mean that.

45:06.970 --> 45:09.100
911. Is this an emergency?

45:09.520 --> 45:12.190
Yes, there's a murder.
It's about to happen, I think.

45:12.350 --> 45:15.690
- The address, please?
- On Wilshire and St. Paul.

45:16.650 --> 45:19.030
The Piano Repair Restoration.

45:19.190 --> 45:21.950
Can I have your name, please?
Your name, please?

45:35.880 --> 45:37.790
Stop it! Stop it!

45:38.380 --> 45:40.300
I closed the book.

45:43.680 --> 45:44.840
Stop it!

46:23.970 --> 46:26.130
Step back, please.
Navarro's already upstairs.

46:26.340 --> 46:28.510
Forensic's been there
for about a half an hour.

46:32.730 --> 46:34.020
Come on, this way.

46:34.310 --> 46:35.640
Step back, please.

46:35.940 --> 46:37.020
Here you go.

46:38.900 --> 46:40.440
Watch your heads, boys.

46:43.570 --> 46:44.740
- Frank.
- Yeah?

46:45.240 --> 46:47.570
- Any news about the witness?
- Not a word.

46:47.740 --> 46:48.950
Check this out.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.500
- Hey, Channing.
- Hi.

47:02.090 --> 47:03.300
Hello, gentlemen.

47:03.460 --> 47:04.630
Bag those up, please.

47:04.800 --> 47:08.220
- We got anything?
- Well, not much.

47:09.430 --> 47:12.260
Male, probably 6'2" or 6'3".

47:12.640 --> 47:15.350
- Didn't leave any fingerprints.
- Look at this.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.610
Son of a bitch sliced his ears off.

47:29.990 --> 47:30.990
Excuse me.

47:31.410 --> 47:33.280
I believe that shade was down.

48:03.480 --> 48:04.940
Virginia?

48:06.150 --> 48:08.110
It's me, Richard. Open the door!

48:15.790 --> 48:17.040
Did you see it?

48:17.500 --> 48:19.250
- Did you make the call?
- Yes.

48:19.620 --> 48:21.370
Can you identify him, honey?

48:23.000 --> 48:24.540
Richard, I'm so scared.

48:26.090 --> 48:28.420
It's okay. It'll be all right.

48:35.510 --> 48:36.600
All-righty.

48:38.100 --> 48:40.100
How about...

48:41.020 --> 48:42.100
that?

48:42.310 --> 48:45.940
- Yeah. That's the right shape.
- Uh-huh.

48:46.150 --> 48:49.990
- But they have to be closer together.
- Closer together, all right.

48:50.910 --> 48:54.200
No problem. How about that?

48:54.370 --> 48:55.660
Yeah, that's it.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.290
Terrific.

48:58.080 --> 48:59.620
Let's work on the nose.

49:01.830 --> 49:03.120
There's no nose.

49:04.750 --> 49:05.750
No nose.

49:06.710 --> 49:10.260
He usually wears a scarf over
the bottom half of his face but...

49:11.090 --> 49:13.300
But he's showed me a couple of times.

49:13.720 --> 49:14.890
He showed you?

49:16.350 --> 49:19.810
That he doesn't have one. Not yet, anyway.

49:21.020 --> 49:23.600
- He doesn't have one what?
- A nose.

49:25.440 --> 49:26.560
I mean, it's like his hair.

49:26.770 --> 49:28.940
He didn't have that either
until he killed Collette.

49:31.150 --> 49:34.820
- And now he's got that guy's ears.
- Collette Berkowitz, the actress?

49:37.030 --> 49:38.790
She was in my acting class.

49:42.830 --> 49:46.290
You're saying it's the same guy
who killed the Berkowitz woman?

49:52.300 --> 49:53.760
How do you know that?

49:54.260 --> 49:57.180
Because he showed me
this morning, on the bus.

49:58.260 --> 50:02.480
Virginia, honey,
we're not following you here.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.100
Why don't we just
take it from the top, okay?

50:07.650 --> 50:10.270
- It all started with the book.
- A book?

50:12.030 --> 50:13.320
Richard knows about it.

50:13.490 --> 50:16.280
It's this weird book
that I picked up where I work.

50:17.030 --> 50:19.780
- Somehow this character got out.
- He got out?

50:20.120 --> 50:21.660
He got out of the book.

50:22.290 --> 50:23.580
It's like...

50:23.790 --> 50:25.290
One minute I was reading about him,

50:25.500 --> 50:27.710
and the next minute he was
standing right next to me.

50:27.880 --> 50:30.550
He thinks that I'm this actress
named Anna Templer.

50:30.710 --> 50:32.260
She's in the book, too.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.260
And he doesn't have a nose?

50:34.430 --> 50:36.340
He doesn't have anything.
He cut it all off.

50:36.510 --> 50:40.720
His hair, his ears, his lips,
and his nose. Everything.

50:41.180 --> 50:44.600
And now he's going to go around
and take things from other people

50:44.810 --> 50:46.810
so he can like graft them
onto his own face.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.900
Miss Clayton, why would he....

50:58.780 --> 51:00.830
Why would anybody do such a thing?

51:01.910 --> 51:04.290
Because he thinks that it will please me.

51:05.830 --> 51:07.920
He thinks that it will please Anna.

51:08.630 --> 51:12.460
But because he thinks I'm Anna,
it's really the same thing, right?

51:15.550 --> 51:17.720
I want to thank you very much
for coming in.

51:17.890 --> 51:20.970
Look, I mean, I know
this must sound really crazy.

51:21.180 --> 51:23.680
No, no, no, no, really.
You've been a big help.

51:23.890 --> 51:25.060
Really.

51:29.810 --> 51:32.770
Detective, when you have a moment,
my office, please?

51:42.080 --> 51:44.290
Can you give me a minute here, please?

51:44.830 --> 51:46.540
Yeah. Sure.

51:56.220 --> 51:57.880
What is happening to you?

52:04.140 --> 52:05.970
Look, Richard, I know it sounds crazy.

52:06.180 --> 52:07.810
You're damn right it sounds crazy.

52:07.980 --> 52:10.650
If you don't believe me,
you should just read the book.

52:10.810 --> 52:11.770
It's all right there.

52:11.980 --> 52:14.070
I don't have to read the book.
It isn't real!

52:18.110 --> 52:19.450
Sorry to interrupt.

52:19.610 --> 52:21.240
Garber's waiting, Richie.

52:25.450 --> 52:27.950
Look, I know you had a terrible night.

52:29.040 --> 52:33.420
Why don't you wait downstairs for me and
when I finish with the lieutenant...

52:33.920 --> 52:37.170
we'll go home and we'll try and figure out
just what you think you saw.

52:38.340 --> 52:41.050
Please, just wait for me downstairs?

52:41.840 --> 52:43.050
Okay, Richard.

53:14.540 --> 53:15.920
Going down?

53:23.510 --> 53:25.340
Why don't you leave me alone?!

53:26.010 --> 53:27.810
Why are you doing this?

53:29.890 --> 53:31.430
Stay away from me!

53:31.730 --> 53:33.270
I want you, Anna.

53:33.520 --> 53:35.730
- You're all I ever wanted.
- Stay away!

53:38.190 --> 53:41.440
This isn't happening.
This is just in my mind.

53:41.610 --> 53:45.030
Things will be better, Anna. I promise.
Soon you'll love me as much as I love you.

53:45.200 --> 53:46.490
No, I'm not Anna!

53:46.950 --> 53:49.870
I'll have your heart one way or another.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.910
Just go ahead and kill me, then.
Get it over with.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.210
Get it over with.

54:15.560 --> 54:16.900
Are you all right?

54:29.910 --> 54:31.410
Sure you're all right?

55:06.450 --> 55:08.030
"Non-fiction."

55:46.570 --> 55:49.110
Look, Mel, I don't want
to hear from strikes.

55:49.280 --> 55:52.280
Look, Mel, I don't give a shit
about your labor problems!

55:52.740 --> 55:54.290
I've got orders to fill.

55:54.450 --> 55:57.040
I need 1,000 copies of
East Of Edith by Friday

55:57.250 --> 55:59.210
or I'm finished with this business!

55:59.370 --> 56:01.880
Yeah, but look,
have the wrappers been printed yet?

56:06.630 --> 56:10.430
Look, check the warehouse.

56:10.680 --> 56:13.600
I think we got a load of that
Western title that didn't sell.

56:14.140 --> 56:16.220
Yeah, Long In The Saddle.

56:18.350 --> 56:20.810
Yeah, just switch the covers.

56:21.610 --> 56:23.150
Oh, Mel...

56:24.730 --> 56:27.030
Mel, nobody's going
to know the difference.

56:28.070 --> 56:29.900
Nobody gives a shit, believe me!

56:33.200 --> 56:36.620
Look, I got someone in the office.
I'll call you back.

56:39.620 --> 56:43.250
- Are you Sidney Zeit?
- No. I'm Nelson Doubleday.

56:43.540 --> 56:44.670
What can I do for you?

56:44.840 --> 56:48.960
Well, actually, if you don't mind, I...
I have something I'd like to show you.

56:49.170 --> 56:51.180
- I only publish smut.
- No, I...

56:51.390 --> 56:54.800
Honey, I would love to chat with you,
but I've got a lot of work to do here.

56:56.890 --> 56:58.520
Did you publish this book?

57:06.150 --> 57:07.900
So my moniker's all over it.

57:08.780 --> 57:09.860
So what is it to you?

57:10.070 --> 57:11.860
I want to know about Malcolm Brand.

57:13.160 --> 57:14.990
Look, I wasn't married to the guy.

57:15.240 --> 57:17.280
I just published a couple of his books.

57:18.120 --> 57:19.250
Please.

57:22.040 --> 57:23.960
You doing a paper or something?

57:25.880 --> 57:26.920
College?

57:29.710 --> 57:33.050
I don't know what to tell you.
The books speak for themselves.

57:33.260 --> 57:34.760
The guy was a lunatic.

57:34.970 --> 57:38.010
Spent the last year of his life
in a rubber room.

57:38.970 --> 57:40.600
That's where he wrote the last one.

57:40.810 --> 57:42.140
One day he just took a powder.

57:42.310 --> 57:44.350
Walked right out through the gate.

57:45.060 --> 57:48.270
Nobody paid any attention.
Found him nearly a week later.

57:49.280 --> 57:52.190
Said it was exposure,
but they couldn't be sure.

57:53.160 --> 57:54.490
Why not?

57:54.820 --> 57:58.080
Because by the time they got to him,
his body was ripped apart...

57:58.240 --> 58:02.040
by some animals.
Probably a pack of hungry dogs.

58:03.920 --> 58:05.670
He was a weirdo, all right.

58:06.290 --> 58:07.630
I remember once...

58:09.380 --> 58:13.010
- right after his first book....
- Much of Madness, More of Sin.

58:13.180 --> 58:15.590
Yeah, that's the one. Did pretty well.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.890
He even had a bit of a following.

58:18.350 --> 58:20.220
Anyway, I got him an assignment.

58:20.390 --> 58:23.100
A short story. Esquire, kiddo.

58:23.440 --> 58:25.480
And we're talking about the mainstream.

58:25.650 --> 58:26.980
And they wanted him.

58:27.150 --> 58:29.610
So Malcolm started working
on her right away.

58:29.820 --> 58:32.780
Two months later,
he returns the advance money

58:32.940 --> 58:35.200
and tells me he can't finish the story.

58:35.360 --> 58:38.660
And get this: Claims the characters
were talking back to him.

58:38.870 --> 58:40.580
Refusing to do what he says.

58:42.620 --> 58:45.080
One even chased him out of town
for a couple of weeks.

58:45.250 --> 58:48.380
The monster from the first book.
You know, the jackal boy.

58:48.630 --> 58:50.130
Claims he had hated him.

58:50.340 --> 58:54.220
Was hunting him down.
Some return of evil for evil.

58:55.300 --> 58:57.430
You published this book as nonfiction.

58:57.640 --> 58:59.050
Both books were nonfiction.

58:59.260 --> 59:02.220
Malcolm insisted.
Claimed they were confessions.

59:03.520 --> 59:05.560
He was a ranting schizophrenic.

59:05.980 --> 59:08.060
Of course, nobody believed
anything he said.

59:08.270 --> 59:11.440
So this stuff in the book,
about what he did to himself...

59:12.860 --> 59:14.070
Oh, jeez, yeah.

59:16.530 --> 59:18.950
He messed himself up
pretty bad, all right.

59:20.530 --> 59:22.280
Yeah. Yep.

59:30.790 --> 59:31.840
Okay.

59:32.050 --> 59:34.510
You got the coroner on three
and your girlfriend's on one.

59:34.710 --> 59:37.470
All right, just call me
if you find anything else.

59:38.390 --> 59:40.930
Dr. Price, could you hold on
for just one minute?

59:41.140 --> 59:42.470
I appreciate it. Thank you.

59:44.520 --> 59:45.520
Virginia?

59:45.730 --> 59:47.640
Why didn't you wait for me downstairs?

59:47.810 --> 59:48.810
Where the hell are you?

59:48.980 --> 59:51.360
Listen, Richard, you're never
going to believe this.

59:51.520 --> 59:54.150
- I know where he's going.
- What are you talking about?

59:55.360 --> 59:57.320
There's going to be
another killing, tonight.

59:57.530 --> 59:58.530
Another guy.

59:59.570 --> 01:00:00.910
A Mediterranean type.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.580
Olive skin with a strong Roman profile.

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:07.160
Brand's going to follow him home
from a bar downtown on Grant.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.460
Virginia, I can't talk about this now.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.080
The phones are ringing off the hook.
I've got two murders to solve...

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:14.920
Damn it, Richard, listen to me!
I'm telling you, it's Brand.

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:18.470
He's back to finish what he started,
what he wrote about doing in the book!

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:21.260
And I'm telling you that
I don't believe in ghosts!

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.470
Just hold on for a minute, all right?

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.890
Dr. Price, thanks for.... Oh, shit!

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.320
Fuck!

01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:50.710
- Waiting for a bus, little girl?
- Jesus Christ, Lenny.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.500
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.380
So what's going on?
You waiting for someone?

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:00.720
No.

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:03.890
Well, yes, actually.
I was waiting for an old friend.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.020
That's something about Collette, huh?

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:10.770
- It's a terrible thing.
- It's horrible.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.230
I was thinking of picking up
a pizza and going home.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.730
You're welcome to join me.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.940
I mean, if your friend doesn't show up.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:26.080
Thank you, but I think I'll just wait here
for a little while longer.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.450
Thanks anyway.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.990
Okay. Sure.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.420
- Well, some other time, then?
- Okay.

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:39.420
- I'll see you in acting class.
- Okay. See you later.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.580
Lenny?

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:15.120
Lenny?

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.340
Lenny?

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.400
54-1. 54-1. Advise for code four.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.000
- Evening, Lieutenant.
- Evening.

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:59.630
- Okay, what do we got here?
- Another mutilation, sir.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.090
He got the nose this time.

01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:08.550
I understand we have a witness?

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.470
Yes, sir. She's right over there.

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:15.770
Oh, hell.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:18.810
- Sir?
- Nothing.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:21.020
- Where's Channing?
- He's on his way.

01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:22.650
Come here.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.410
Virginia? Thanks, I've got it. It's okay.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.120
Richard, Richard, do you know who that is?

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.290
That's Lenny, from my acting class.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.500
- What are you talking about?
- I knew this was gonna happen!

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:44.130
It's word for word out of the book.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.380
The bar, the alley.

01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:48.430
I couldn't do anything!
I couldn't make it stop.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.550
It's okay. Just come over here
and tell me what happened.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.850
Damn it, Richard, where were you?
Why didn't you listen to me?

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.640
- Why did you hang up the phone?
- I didn't hang up on you, okay?

01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:02.060
It was crazy when you called.
I just hit a button and...

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:06.320
And you just couldn't deal with it, right?
You just couldn't deal with it.

01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:08.450
That there might be some
truth in what I'm saying!

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:09.950
What's the matter with you?

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:12.200
I'm sorry, okay?

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.910
Maybe I should have looked into this thing

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.410
- a little bit more than I did.
- Yeah.

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.040
Garber had us running down other leads.
He's my boss, what am I supposed to do?

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.090
You should just read the book,
Richard, please!

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.090
And then we'll talk about it.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:41.140
Okay, all right, I admit
there are certain similarities.

01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:43.060
I'll even go as far as to say...

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:45.650
that maybe there's some
kind of copycat killer out there.

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.780
Somebody who's read the book
and is getting off on the gore.

01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.990
I don't know.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.450
That's fine, Richard,
but it doesn't explain

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.660
Malcolm Brand showing up in my apartment.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.120
Look, let's just try and stick close
to earth for the time being, all right?

01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:00.080
Now what we have to do
is we have to figure out

01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:01.790
when this maniac is going to strike next.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.290
Well...

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:07.130
It's right here. It's here in Chapter 8.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.220
"I watched her before.

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:15.470
"Perched behind her desk,
lonely lady librarian,

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.720
"love-starved swan.

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.810
"How I imagined her sweet, full lips

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:24.350
"burning passionately against her pillow
late at night when the stone-cold cats

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.650
"ceased standing guard over her lust."

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.320
He means the library.

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:31.150
I mean, it's all right here.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Right down to the stone-cold cats.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:37.330
He means the lions outside
the steps of the main branch.

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.080
Do you see?

01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.930
So what happened in the end?

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.350
To the girl, I mean, Anna.

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:05.270
You don't want to know.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.650
Yes, I do.

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:22.370
He cuts out her heart with his scalpel,
and he wears it around his neck.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.290
Like a crucifix.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.510
Close to his own heart.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.200
- Hello?
- Looks like we're in luck.

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:00.780
Garber's gonna let us go for it.

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:02.580
He's even throwing in some uniforms.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.500
That's great news, Richard.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:09.420
It took some doing, but he's desperate.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.380
And if we're wrong....

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:13.670
No, we're not wrong.
I'm positive about this.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.010
He'll be there tonight.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.260
All right, the library closes at 8:00.

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:19.220
Can you be there in one half hour?

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.970
In half an hour?

01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:23.470
Okay, okay, I'll be there.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:34.110
Mona, I'm gonna leave
work a little early tonight.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.240
- All right?
- Fine.

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:37.700
Okay.

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:42.580
- Mona, is there something wrong?
- No, nothing.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.540
Nothing's wrong. Just 'cause you've
walked around here like a zombie all day.

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:49.290
You haven't said two words
to me since you got here.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.290
I'll be stuck here doing your work

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.590
while you run all over the city
fighting crime or something.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.590
It's the estate sale stuff.
I forgot to unpack it.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.630
The least you can do is
let me in on what's going on.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.930
I will. I'll call you later.

01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:04.770
And that stuff, I'll unpack it
tomorrow morning.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.390
Okay?

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.480
No, forget about it.

01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:10.480
I'll finish it off tonight.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.560
All right.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.279
Okay, I'm gonna go.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.080
And I'll call you later.

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.790
Okay. Thanks, Mona.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.330
- Yeah.
- Bye.

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.970
Okay, Joey, the place is secure.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.310
Everyone should be out
in four minutes, you got it?

01:08:58.649 --> 01:08:59.779
Marian...

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:03.819
If you see or hear anything,
anything at all, you let us know.

01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:06.120
- We'll be listening on that radio.
- Okay.

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:09.330
The rent-a-cops have all been briefed.

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.410
Business as usual.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.210
Good, you understand that?

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:14.880
It's possible that this guy's been
watching you for a few days.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.920
So we don't want you to
do anything unusual.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:20.670
What you normally do when you lock up,
that's what we want you to do tonight.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.550
All right, kids, showtime.

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:26.220
There, almost set.

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:30.390
- You're sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:32.310
Here we go.

01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:40.990
- Is everybody ready?
- I think I....

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.800
- You're sure you want to do this?
- No.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.260
Not particularly, but I'm
the only one who fits the suit.

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:15.270
All right?

01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:49.680
Oh, my God, it's really dark down here.

01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:53.730
Hello?

01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:56.350
Hope you guys can hear me.

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:12.100
Okay, I'm in the microfiche room.

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:31.610
Wait. I think I hear something.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.070
- Where is she?
- Shh, shh.

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:41.540
It's footsteps.

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.250
There's somebody out in the hall.

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:50.930
- They're coming closer!
- That's it, go!

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:52.300
Richard!

01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:07.730
He's in the room.

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:09.780
Richard, he's in the room.

01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:21.250
Freeze, police officer!

01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:38.970
Coffee?

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.310
I'll have a uniform
take you back to my place.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.400
And I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:50.940
What, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.820
He didn't show up. What can we do?

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.660
Listen, Richard,
it's gonna happen tonight.

01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:59.370
I mean, maybe not here, but somewhere.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.620
If it hasn't happened already.

01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:06.920
I mean, you know, there's more
than one library in this city.

01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:09.130
Not with cats on the front steps.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.300
Come on, Virginia, we gave it a shot.

01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:12.590
It didn't pan out.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.890
We can't stake out every building
in the city with books inside

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:19.260
based on some cryptic passage
from a 30-year-old novel.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.020
Now go back to my apartment, all right?

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:26.860
We'll talk about it later.

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:28.940
Right, later.

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.030
Vรกmonos, Richie.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.070
You got some shit to shovel.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.880
Channing, I want to talk to you. Now.

01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:22.330
"Librarian.

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.580
"Love-starved swan.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.670
"Passionate lips.

01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:38.050
"Lions...

01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:41.510
"and cats."

01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:50.360
Get off the phone, Mona.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.880
Detective Channing's desk,
Detective Fishman speaking.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:14.210
Hi, Virginia.

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.800
No, he's in with the lieutenant right now.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.590
Sure.

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.680
Okay, I'll get it to him. 'Bye.

01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:33.690
Fishman. Where you going?

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.570
- Important message for Richard.
- Wait a minute, let me see that.

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:40.030
Yep, Richie's nutty girlfriend.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.530
Believe me, you won't be doing him
any favors by bringing this to him now.

01:17:13.770 --> 01:17:15.190
Mona?

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.460
Mona?

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.440
Mona, are you back there?

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.010
Mona, I'm sorry.

01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:39.940
I knew you'd come, Anna.

01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:45.860
It's our wedding day.

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.510
No. Oh, no!

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:13.890
Somebody let me out of here!

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:41.600
Leave me alone!

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.140
Leave me alone!

01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:35.320
Anna!

01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:52.590
Stay away from me.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:22:01.100
Finally your heart will be mine.

01:22:05.690 --> 01:22:06.860
Don't!

01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:38.390
Virginia, move away. Back away.

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:45.480
You all right, baby?

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:48.400
- Sweetheart?
- See?

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.510
Son of a bitch!

01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:52.460
Head more canine than human.
A scrawny, growling, evil thing.

01:23:52.630 --> 01:23:54.960
Conceived much of madness, more of sin.

01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:57.590
It lived, it lived!
