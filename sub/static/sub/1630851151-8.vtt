11:20.745 --> 11:24.227
REPORTER:
Today, Monica Lewinsky's
mother Marcia Lewis

11:24.444 --> 11:26.577
faced the grand jury
for a day of testimony.

11:26.664 --> 11:28.231
REPORTER 2:
Marcia, what did
they ask you in there?

11:28.361 --> 11:30.015
REPORTER 3:
Marcia, is your daughter
going to jail?

11:30.102 --> 11:32.017
REPORTER:
Starr is trying to build a case

11:32.104 --> 11:33.802
against Lewinsky
by figuring out what,

11:34.019 --> 11:35.586
if anything, her mother knows

11:35.717 --> 11:37.588
about the alleged affair.

11:37.675 --> 11:39.459
-REPORTER 2: Marcia! Marcia!
-REPORTER 3: Marcia!

11:39.590 --> 11:41.592
REPORTER 4:
Marcia, what's gonna happen
to Monica?

11:41.679 --> 11:43.463
I can't watch this, I can't.

11:43.594 --> 11:45.683
It'll be all right, it's okay.

11:45.814 --> 11:48.947
People will not stop saying that
to me.

11:50.601 --> 11:52.690
How could you let this happen?

11:52.821 --> 11:54.692
GINSBURG:
Do you want me
to use mind control?

11:54.823 --> 11:55.824
I-I can't force them to deal!

11:56.041 --> 11:58.043
BERNIE:
Yes, you can-- it's your job.

11:58.130 --> 11:59.697
GINSBURG:
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

11:59.915 --> 12:00.829
BERNIE:
Monica needs protection.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.178
She needs immunity now.

12:02.265 --> 12:03.353
GINSBURG:
They came to terms!

12:03.483 --> 12:04.702
I made them come to terms, okay?

12:04.833 --> 12:06.399
-They bitched out!
-This has to end.

12:06.530 --> 12:08.837
-It will.
-When?!

12:08.924 --> 12:10.403
How the hell should I know?!
Ask Starr!

12:10.621 --> 12:12.623
[birds chirping]

12:19.238 --> 12:22.502
MICHAEL ZELDIN:
Monica Lewinsky is
the only person who has

12:22.633 --> 12:25.288
direct evidence of the alleged
encounter with the president.

12:25.505 --> 12:28.421
She is the linchpin
of Mr. Starr's prosecution.

12:28.639 --> 12:30.423
Without her, he has nothing.

12:30.554 --> 12:33.078
Shut the fuck up.

12:33.209 --> 12:35.211
The president lied
to the American people

12:35.428 --> 12:37.300
and I'm the villain.

12:37.430 --> 12:39.650
His poll numbers are up.

12:41.086 --> 12:43.654
Where are we at getting him
to testify?

12:43.785 --> 12:45.308
Well, we've drafted a subpoena,

12:45.525 --> 12:47.658
but it's useless unless we have
a deal with Monica.

12:47.745 --> 12:50.095
I mean, she's denied it
and he can, too.

12:50.182 --> 12:52.228
We need to get her side
of the story.

12:52.315 --> 12:54.534
It's that malpractice lawyer--
he's getting in our way.

12:54.752 --> 12:57.407
We should just do a deal.

12:57.537 --> 12:59.975
No, I can't,
not with that lunatic Ginsburg.

13:00.105 --> 13:02.629
The man is outside
the universe of discourse.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.110
We've got to keep
putting pressure on Monica.

13:05.328 --> 13:07.199
We've already tried
intimidation.

13:07.330 --> 13:09.549
We-we've subpoenaed her mother,
for Christ's sakes.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.552
Betty Currie,
every single one of her friends.

13:12.683 --> 13:14.337
I mean, what more can we do?

13:15.686 --> 13:17.775
We can turn up the heat.

13:20.517 --> 13:22.562
NARRATOR [on TV]:
So I've always been
fascinated with big cats.

13:22.693 --> 13:25.043
The best thing
about working with a big cat

13:25.130 --> 13:27.350
is the ability just
to go inside with him.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.134
And have a relationship...

13:29.265 --> 13:31.267
BARBARA:
Look at you.

13:31.354 --> 13:33.225
-You're getting so good.
-Thanks.

13:33.356 --> 13:35.575
It's not what I thought I'd be
doing day and night at 24.

13:35.706 --> 13:37.795
I have to remind myself
that it's not permanent,

13:37.926 --> 13:40.015
and in ten years,
I'll be in a whole new life,

13:40.232 --> 13:42.800
dealing with my kids
and my husband and my job

13:43.018 --> 13:44.933
and... I just have
to hold onto that.

13:45.063 --> 13:46.282
Nothing's forever.

13:46.412 --> 13:48.501
[phone ringing]

13:50.155 --> 13:51.417
Ginsburg.

13:51.504 --> 13:53.202
I'll get your dad.

13:53.289 --> 13:55.160
[sighs]

13:55.291 --> 13:57.162
Did you hear something?
Is it good news?

13:57.293 --> 13:59.730
No, it's not.

13:59.817 --> 14:01.863
-[reporters clamoring]
-All right.

14:01.950 --> 14:04.691
Back up, back up, please.

14:04.822 --> 14:06.911
-Back up.
-Mr. Lewinsky!

14:07.042 --> 14:08.826
Will you visit
your daughter in jail?

14:08.957 --> 14:10.741
[sighs]
Can they really arrest me?

14:10.872 --> 14:12.612
Not today.

14:12.743 --> 14:14.310
They're just trying
to scare you, that's all.

14:22.274 --> 14:25.756
Monica, we need
a handwriting sample first.

14:25.843 --> 14:28.063
If you could, please,
print your name here

14:28.193 --> 14:30.239
three times, then write
the numbers one through ten.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.989
Okay, and now we fingerprint.

Monica, how'd it go in there?

14:54.350 --> 14:55.568
REPORTER 2:
Monica, what's next for you?

14:55.786 --> 14:57.135
Where are you headed next?

14:57.222 --> 14:58.963

Did they fingerprint you
in there?

14:59.094 --> 15:00.008
REPORTER 4:
How did it go in there?

15:00.225 --> 15:01.879
You guys go on ahead,
I'll take care of them.

15:02.010 --> 15:03.315
REPORTER 5:
How are you feeling right now?

15:03.446 --> 15:04.664
GINSBURG:
Excuse me!

15:04.795 --> 15:06.579
Today, ladies and gentlemen,

15:06.666 --> 15:08.364
my client was subject to an act

15:08.451 --> 15:11.019
of abject intimidation
by Ken Starr

15:11.149 --> 15:13.673
and the Office
of Independent Counsel.

15:13.891 --> 15:17.112
Now, believe me, I understand
that many of you have questions.

15:17.329 --> 15:19.244
I'm going to be indicted,
aren't I, Dad?

15:19.375 --> 15:21.246
I'm going to prison.

15:21.377 --> 15:23.031
I don't know.

15:23.161 --> 15:25.598
But I do know we need
to make a change.

15:28.253 --> 15:30.386
GINSBURG:
I realized, when my strategy

15:30.473 --> 15:32.257
hit a wall,
that I should step aside.

15:32.388 --> 15:35.478
I insisted that Monica find
new counsel.

15:35.565 --> 15:40.048
Now, of course, I am going
to miss the fight, but

15:40.135 --> 15:42.485
I assure you I intend
to fight on

15:42.615 --> 15:44.269
against the many injustices

15:44.400 --> 15:46.054
of the Office
of the Independent Counsel.

15:46.184 --> 15:47.620
[TV shuts off]

15:47.751 --> 15:49.492
Ginsburg is out.

15:49.622 --> 15:51.711
Monica fired him,
hired new lawyers this morning.

15:51.842 --> 15:55.541
You know Cacheris, represented
Fawn Hall during Iran-Contra.

15:58.631 --> 16:00.416
Let's make a deal.

16:09.425 --> 16:11.993
Thank you.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.952
Monica, good to see you.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.085
-Good to see you, too.
-Any trouble getting here?

16:17.302 --> 16:19.522
Uh, no, no.

16:19.652 --> 16:21.089
No paparazzi--
the disguise worked.

16:21.306 --> 16:24.266
Okay, this will be
quick and painless.

16:24.396 --> 16:27.138
That's not really
how these people operate.

16:32.665 --> 16:34.015
-Morning.
-Plato.

16:48.420 --> 16:51.206
Ken Starr's mother-in-law
lives here.

16:51.336 --> 16:53.208
It's Grandma's house,
if you will.

16:53.338 --> 16:54.774
Is Ken Starr coming?

16:54.905 --> 16:56.559
No, but he was here earlier.

16:56.689 --> 16:58.561
I'm Sol Wisenberg,
we met at the off...

16:58.691 --> 17:00.476
I remember you.

PLATO:
Our client will agree
to the terms of your deal.

17:09.006 --> 17:10.703
She's gonna cooperate fully.

17:10.921 --> 17:13.010
And will testify truthfully

17:13.228 --> 17:15.491
about every aspect of her
relationship with Bill Clinton.

17:15.578 --> 17:17.232
In return,

17:17.449 --> 17:19.364
we want immunity
from prosecution for everyone

17:19.495 --> 17:21.018
with the last name Lewinsky.

17:21.149 --> 17:23.586
And this time,
we want it signed.

17:23.803 --> 17:26.241
Is your client in possession
of a navy blue dress?

17:26.371 --> 17:28.025
We're not talking
about a dress today.

17:28.156 --> 17:30.245
If a dress exists,
it will be delivered to you

17:30.375 --> 17:32.290
after the agreement is
delivered to Monica.

17:36.860 --> 17:39.471
Okay, Monica...

17:39.602 --> 17:41.212
please take us through
everything from the beginning.

17:44.476 --> 17:47.653
In 1995, I started my internship
at the White House.

17:49.264 --> 17:52.180
Um, during the fall
of that year,

17:52.397 --> 17:55.618
uh...
during the government shutdown,

17:55.748 --> 17:58.969
the president and I began
a relationship.

in Kenya and Tanzania

18:15.420 --> 18:17.118
in what U.S. officials
are calling

18:17.205 --> 18:18.641
a coordinated terrorist attack.

18:18.858 --> 18:20.643
Hundreds have been killed

18:20.773 --> 18:22.427
and thousands more injured.

Rescue crews continue
to search the buildings

18:25.343 --> 18:26.692
for survivors.

18:31.654 --> 18:34.439
It was Usama bin Laden
and his al-Qaeda network.

18:34.657 --> 18:36.354
You might recall
our briefing last year.

18:36.485 --> 18:38.443
Yeah.

18:38.574 --> 18:40.445
He was supposed
to be just some rich kid

18:40.576 --> 18:42.317
talking tough in a cave.

18:42.447 --> 18:43.666
Well, now he's crossed
the Rubicon.

18:43.796 --> 18:44.884
He's killed American citizens.

18:45.015 --> 18:46.451
Well, we have to hit back.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.149
Uh, we're drawing up
a list of targets.

18:48.236 --> 18:50.412
He owns a factory in Sudan

18:50.542 --> 18:52.544
that he may use
to make chemical weapons.

18:52.675 --> 18:54.024
I want to get rid of this guy.

18:54.155 --> 18:55.591
Yes, sir.

KENDALL:
Do you have a moment
to speak, Mr. President?

19:01.249 --> 19:03.338
Sure.

19:04.687 --> 19:07.385
What is it?

19:09.344 --> 19:11.563
Starr's team signed
an immunity deal

19:11.694 --> 19:13.478
with Monica Lewinsky.

19:13.696 --> 19:15.480
She's cooperating.

19:15.698 --> 19:17.613
I don't see how we can
keep you from testifying

19:17.700 --> 19:19.267
before the grand jury.

19:19.441 --> 19:21.138
What if I refuse?

19:21.269 --> 19:23.836
Starr's drawing up
a subpoena right now.

19:25.273 --> 19:27.144
Fuck.

19:27.362 --> 19:29.712
KENDALL:
You could plead the Fifth,
lay it at my feet.

19:29.842 --> 19:32.062
You can say that on the advice
of your attorney,

19:32.193 --> 19:33.933
you have reluctantly decided

19:34.064 --> 19:35.065
to invoke
your Fifth Amendment right.

19:35.283 --> 19:37.589
Yeah, what is that
gonna look like?

19:37.720 --> 19:39.504
The president
of the United States

19:39.635 --> 19:42.159
sounding like a Mafia toady.

19:42.290 --> 19:44.292
Fuck Starr!

19:45.423 --> 19:47.512
So what would you like us to do?

19:47.643 --> 19:49.645
I don't want to be subpoenaed.

19:51.516 --> 19:54.084
You know... just tell 'em...

19:54.171 --> 19:55.738
I'll go in voluntarily.

19:55.868 --> 19:57.870
All right.

19:58.958 --> 20:00.525
Look, one more thing, sir.

20:00.743 --> 20:02.788
They're requesting
a blood sample from you.

20:04.877 --> 20:07.228
Do you have any idea why
they'd want to run a DNA test?

20:15.018 --> 20:16.976
MONICA:
Leaves of Grass.

20:17.107 --> 20:19.327
The president gave that
to me as a gift.

20:22.895 --> 20:25.202
That was also a gift.

20:37.432 --> 20:40.130
Uh, Gap dress, size 12.

Dark blue.

Where the fuck are they?

20:47.355 --> 20:49.792
Is this some sort of power play?

20:49.922 --> 20:52.447
Well, Starr assured me
they'd be here soon.

20:52.577 --> 20:54.362
Yeah, I-I got a hundred people
and the attorney general

20:54.492 --> 20:56.015
waiting for me in the Blue Room.

20:56.233 --> 20:57.582
This is a waste of my time.

20:57.713 --> 20:58.801
[door opens]

20:58.931 --> 21:00.368
Mr. President, sorry we're late.

21:00.498 --> 21:02.021
[sighs]

21:02.239 --> 21:04.023
Thank you for agreeing
to take this DNA test.

21:04.241 --> 21:06.156
I didn't agree. You insisted.

21:06.287 --> 21:07.940
Can we get on with this?

21:22.738 --> 21:25.044
Mr. President, why did you say
you were "never alone"

21:25.262 --> 21:26.742
with Monica Lewinsky
when there's evidence

21:26.829 --> 21:28.309
you were alone with her
on numerous occasions?

21:28.396 --> 21:30.485
I don't believe I did say that.

21:30.615 --> 21:32.965
Well, you said you never went
with her to your private study.

21:33.096 --> 21:34.271
Did I? Maybe.

21:34.402 --> 21:36.273
I don't recall.

21:36.404 --> 21:38.057
Did you or did you not
participate

21:38.188 --> 21:39.929
in certain intimacies...?

21:40.059 --> 21:42.540
What is with this softball
bullshit, "certain intimacies"?

21:42.627 --> 21:44.847
We got to ask Clinton
the tough questions.

21:44.977 --> 21:47.632
What do you suggest, Kavanaugh?

21:47.719 --> 21:49.373
If Monica Lewinsky
says you ejaculated

21:49.504 --> 21:51.070
into her mouth
on two separate occasions,

21:51.201 --> 21:52.724
would she be lying?

21:52.855 --> 21:53.856
If Monica Lewinsky says
that you masturbated

21:53.986 --> 21:55.858
into a trash can
in your secretary's office,

21:55.988 --> 21:57.381
would she be lying?

21:57.512 --> 21:59.165
-We need to be respectful.
-Fuck respectful.

21:59.296 --> 22:00.428
Hit him between the eyes.

22:00.645 --> 22:02.734
Brett, we don't even know
if the DNA is a match.

22:02.865 --> 22:04.780
It's a match.

22:04.867 --> 22:05.781
-Oh!
-Yeah!

22:05.998 --> 22:07.348
-Yeah!
-Ha!

22:07.435 --> 22:08.566
Hot damn.

22:11.395 --> 22:13.528
Here's what we expect from them.

22:13.658 --> 22:16.531
Starr's team only has four hours
to question you.

22:16.748 --> 22:19.664
We should use long responses
to run out the clock.

22:19.795 --> 22:22.101
Sir...

22:22.319 --> 22:24.452
we need to know
as much as we can

22:24.669 --> 22:27.324
to help prepare you for this.

22:27.455 --> 22:30.806
What was the extent of your
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky?

22:30.936 --> 22:32.938
Look.

22:34.810 --> 22:38.335
Monica and I spent
some time together.

22:40.119 --> 22:43.819
And on a handful of occasions
there was some intimate contact.

22:46.125 --> 22:49.477
But we did not have
sexual relations.

22:51.609 --> 22:53.132
What does that mean, sir?

22:53.263 --> 22:55.004
By some definitions,

22:55.134 --> 22:57.223
the contact between me
and Monica could be classed

22:57.354 --> 22:59.617
as "sexual relations."

23:01.271 --> 23:03.795
But at the Paula Jones
deposition,

23:03.926 --> 23:05.928
her lawyers...

23:06.145 --> 23:08.496
gave me a detailed description
of what they considered

23:08.626 --> 23:10.411
to be sexual relations.

23:10.498 --> 23:12.587
I read it, I thought about it,

23:12.804 --> 23:15.285
and I decided that what happened
between me and Monica

23:15.416 --> 23:16.939
didn't count.

23:17.156 --> 23:19.420
Under their definition...

23:21.291 --> 23:23.293
I told the truth.

23:26.165 --> 23:27.950
[both chuckle]

23:28.080 --> 23:29.865

23:30.866 --> 23:33.303

my work cut out for me.

to go through it.

32:56.083 --> 32:59.042
I engaged in conduct
that was wrong.

32:59.173 --> 33:03.307
These encounters did not

They did not constitute
sexual relations

to be defined

33:08.878 --> 33:11.968

33:17.539 --> 33:20.194
These encounters ended
at my insistence.

33:20.324 --> 33:22.979
I regret that what began
as a friendship

came to include this conduct.

33:25.764 --> 33:28.985
And I take full responsibility
for my actions.

33:31.770 --> 33:34.643
whatever other information

34:17.860 --> 34:19.601
Yes, sir, I do.

34:19.731 --> 34:22.386
And do you remember the term
"sexual relations"

34:22.604 --> 34:24.606
-from your deposition?
-I do.

34:24.780 --> 34:26.738
Did you understand
the definition of that term?

34:26.869 --> 34:28.653
-I did.
-[chuckles]

34:29.872 --> 34:31.830
If you understood the term,

34:31.961 --> 34:34.181
then why did you deny
having sexual relations

34:34.311 --> 34:35.965
with Monica Lewinsky?

34:36.096 --> 34:38.402
Well, why don't I tell you

34:38.620 --> 34:42.189
my understanding of the, uh,
definition I was given.

34:42.406 --> 34:44.626
As far as I'm concerned,

34:44.756 --> 34:47.063
"sexual relations"
covers contact

34:47.194 --> 34:49.283
between certain areas
of the body

34:49.413 --> 34:52.416
with "an intent
to arouse or gratify."

34:52.547 --> 34:55.550
It excludes any other activity.

34:57.856 --> 35:00.163
So you're saying
it only applies to you yourself

35:00.294 --> 35:02.861
touching certain parts
of Ms. Lewinsky's body

35:02.992 --> 35:04.559
with intent to arouse her?

35:04.776 --> 35:06.952
Exactly.

35:07.083 --> 35:09.738
See, when I read it, I thought
it was a strange definition,

35:09.868 --> 35:11.305
but that was the one
that the Paula Jones

35:11.435 --> 35:13.089

35:13.220 --> 35:16.310

During your deposition,
your lawyer said

35:16.440 --> 35:18.529
there was no sex of any kind
in any manner

35:18.660 --> 35:20.314
between you and Ms. Lewinsky.

35:20.444 --> 35:21.880
Isn't that false?

35:22.098 --> 35:24.535
-No.
-Did Monica lie in her affidavit

35:24.666 --> 35:27.321
by denying the two of you had
a relationship?

35:27.451 --> 35:29.236
Not necessarily.

35:29.323 --> 35:31.673
See, I-I don't know
what Monica was thinking

35:31.803 --> 35:33.762
when she filled out
her affidavit,

35:33.892 --> 35:36.025
but it's quite possible
that what she said wasn't a lie,

35:36.243 --> 35:38.897
depending on how she interpreted

35:39.028 --> 35:41.465
that definition
of "sexual relations."

35:41.683 --> 35:43.772
[exhales]
Mr. President,

35:43.902 --> 35:46.688
even if you didn't have "sexual
relations" by that definition,

35:46.818 --> 35:50.692
you still engaged in...
other sexual activities.

35:50.822 --> 35:52.346
So the statement
"There was no sex of any kind

35:52.476 --> 35:55.262
in any manner" is a lie.

35:55.479 --> 35:57.264
Is it not?

35:59.918 --> 36:01.790
Well, that depends
upon what the meaning

36:01.920 --> 36:04.619
of the word "is" is.

36:06.795 --> 36:08.797
For fuck's sake, he's running
circles around them.

36:08.927 --> 36:10.712
BILL:
If "is" means

36:10.929 --> 36:12.714
"is and never has been,"

36:12.844 --> 36:14.281
that is one thing,

36:14.498 --> 36:16.718
but if it means "there is none

36:16.848 --> 36:18.937
at the present moment,"

36:19.155 --> 36:20.852
then that was a completely

36:20.983 --> 36:23.203
true statement.

36:28.512 --> 36:29.948
Did you talk
with Ms. Lewinsky about what

36:30.079 --> 36:31.428
she meant to write
in her affidavit?

36:31.515 --> 36:33.822
No, sir, I did not.

36:33.952 --> 36:36.955
Your lawyer was trying
to mislead the judge during

36:37.173 --> 36:38.957
your deposition, was he not?

36:39.131 --> 36:41.177
You'll have to ask him.

36:41.308 --> 36:43.962
I was focusing
on my own testimony.

36:44.093 --> 36:45.834
In that testimony, when asked

36:45.964 --> 36:47.531
if you'd ever been alone
with Ms. Lewinsky,

36:47.662 --> 36:49.403
you seemed to struggle
with your memory.

36:49.533 --> 36:50.882
Were you trying
to mislead the judge?

36:51.013 --> 36:53.189
No, look...

36:53.407 --> 36:56.061
I did my best, sir,
at this time.

36:56.192 --> 36:59.413
I did not know
what I now know about this.

36:59.630 --> 37:02.242
A lot of other things
were going on in my life.

37:02.329 --> 37:04.766
Did I want this come out? No.

37:04.983 --> 37:06.898
Was I embarrassed about it? Yes.

37:06.985 --> 37:08.900
Did I ask her to lie about it?

37:09.118 --> 37:11.120
No.

37:11.207 --> 37:13.992
I say to the grand jury,
put yourself in my position.

37:14.123 --> 37:16.865
I am doing my best to cooperat.

37:16.995 --> 37:19.084
And protect myself,

37:19.215 --> 37:20.869
my family and my office.

37:20.999 --> 37:24.655
I am trying to tell the truth

37:24.786 --> 37:27.571
about what happened
between Ms. Lewinsky and me.

37:27.702 --> 37:30.444
But this does not
change the fact

37:30.574 --> 37:33.229
that the real reason
that the Jones lawyers

37:33.360 --> 37:35.362
zeroed in on me
in the first place

37:35.449 --> 37:37.712
was because this was
a bogus lawsuit

37:37.799 --> 37:40.280
funded by my political enemies.

37:42.717 --> 37:44.675
[clears throat] Uh...

I say we just move on
to their questions.

37:56.296 --> 37:58.733
No, I have some questions.

38:09.483 --> 38:11.528
Mr. President,
in your statement earlier,

38:11.615 --> 38:14.618
you said that you engaged
in "intimate contact"

38:14.749 --> 38:16.968
with Ms. Lewinsky.

38:17.055 --> 38:20.537
What exactly do you mean
by that?

38:20.624 --> 38:23.061
I did things
that were inappropriate,

38:23.192 --> 38:25.716
but they did not include
any activity

38:25.847 --> 38:27.631
that was within the definition

38:27.762 --> 38:29.590
of "sexual relations"
I was given.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.506
Directly touching
the listed body parts

38:32.636 --> 38:35.204
with "an intent
to arouse or gratify."

38:35.422 --> 38:37.554
Is kissing
within that definition?

38:37.641 --> 38:40.949
As I understood it, no.

38:41.079 --> 38:43.865
Is touching a person's breast
within that definition?

38:44.082 --> 38:46.302
If it was direct

38:46.433 --> 38:48.870
and not through clothing,

38:48.957 --> 38:51.873
then, yes, I think
that could constitute contact.

38:52.003 --> 38:55.006
Is having oral sex
performed on you

38:55.137 --> 38:57.357
within that definition?

38:57.444 --> 38:59.968
-No.
-Why not?

39:00.098 --> 39:02.100
Because there was no intent

39:02.231 --> 39:04.668
on my end to arouse.

39:07.541 --> 39:10.674
Did Monica Lewinsky
perform oral sex on you?

39:10.761 --> 39:14.199
And I believe the people
of the grand jury deserve

39:14.330 --> 39:16.811
a direct answer to this--
did she, yes

39:16.898 --> 39:18.639
or no?

39:18.769 --> 39:22.904
I am not going
to answer that question.

39:23.121 --> 39:26.342

I did have a relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky

41:28.464 --> 41:31.032

like a kind of victory lap
from state to state.

48:29.102 --> 48:32.018
You know, and we were driving
through her hometown

48:32.235 --> 48:35.978
in Park Ridge,
and the limo runs out of gas.

48:36.109 --> 48:39.025
So, you know, we pull
into this little station,

48:39.155 --> 48:42.245

48:42.376 --> 48:45.596

"Hey, Hillary, remember me?

48:45.727 --> 48:48.034
We used to date."

48:48.251 --> 48:50.340
And, uh, as we pull away,

48:50.471 --> 48:52.473
you know,
I turn to her all proud,

48:52.603 --> 48:54.475
and I said,

48:54.605 --> 48:56.694
"I bet you're glad
you married the president

48:56.825 --> 48:58.827
and not that guy."

49:03.614 --> 49:05.703

he would be president.
