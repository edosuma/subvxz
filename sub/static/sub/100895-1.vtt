00:16.182 --> 00:18.727
<i>First, the weather changed.</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:23.064
<i>The deniers knew why,</i>
<i>but they still doomed us with their lies.</i>

00:24.315 --> 00:26.609
<i>War made the Earth even hotter.</i>

00:26.693 --> 00:29.988
<i>Her ice melted,</i>
<i>and all her species crashed.</i>

00:31.072 --> 00:34.200
<i>So the men of science</i>
<i>tried to cool the Earth</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:36.494
<i>to reverse the damage they had sown.</i>

00:37.787 --> 00:41.791
<i>But instead, they froze her to the core.</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:49.841
<i>Only the visionary Mr. Wilford</i>
<i>foresaw the future,</i>

00:50.425 --> 00:52.802
<i>and he prepared a great ark train.</i>

00:55.430 --> 01:00.560
<i>In the final days of the Freeze,</i>
<i>the rich, many of them responsible,</i>

01:00.643 --> 01:05.523
<i>retreated to </i>Snowpiercer, <i>1,001 cars long.</i>

01:08.026 --> 01:09.402
<i>So we the people,</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:11.321
<i>the survivors left behind...</i>

01:13.156 --> 01:15.158
<i>...we invaded their train.</i>

01:16.451 --> 01:17.619
Help! Help!

01:18.536 --> 01:19.954
Get them! Now!

01:21.664 --> 01:23.041
Let me on!

01:25.835 --> 01:27.003
Get off her!

01:34.052 --> 01:37.597
<i>All aboard.</i>
<i>All ticketed passengers, please board.</i>

01:38.598 --> 01:41.059
Snowpiercer<i> departs</i>
<i>at precisely zero hours.</i>

01:41.142 --> 01:42.060
Come on, Miles!

01:44.729 --> 01:45.688
Mike?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.816
- Snowpiercer<i> departs in ten...</i>
-Mike!

01:47.899 --> 01:50.318
<i>-...nine, eight, seven...</i>
-No!

01:50.401 --> 01:52.737
<i>-...six, five...</i>

01:52.821 --> 01:56.199
<i>...four, three, two...</i>

01:56.282 --> 01:58.535
<i>one, departure.</i>

02:04.124 --> 02:08.711
Back 'em up. That's it!
Back 'em up! Throw 'em off the train!

02:09.295 --> 02:10.463
Move back! Go to the back!

02:10.547 --> 02:12.715
-Zarah!
- Go to the back! Come on, 'Dre.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.220
-Stay close.
- Move!

02:17.846 --> 02:19.722
-Move back!
- Miles, this way. Go.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.225
You're gonna have to hide.
Go! Keep going.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.563
It's going to be okay.
You need to hide, okay, honey?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.565
Just get in there, okay?
Just don't come out.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.276
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be all right.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.944
-Come here.
-No!

02:34.237 --> 02:35.196
Get off me!

02:43.121 --> 02:44.581
-Move back!

02:44.664 --> 02:46.249
Contain the bastards!

02:49.210 --> 02:50.503
Close the door!

02:50.587 --> 02:51.754
Don't let 'em close it!

03:00.305 --> 03:02.056
<i>This is </i>Snowpiercer.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.185
<i>Around and around the Earth we circle.</i>
<i>We can never stop.</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:11.608
<i>These are our revolutions,</i>
<i>1,001 cars long.</i>

04:01.574 --> 04:03.618
Attention, all passengers.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.579
Wilford Industries
wishes you good morning.

04:07.664 --> 04:12.418
<i>The temperature outside</i>
<i>is -119.6 degrees Celsius.</i>

04:12.502 --> 04:16.130
<i>As we enter the Yukon territory</i>
<i>of the former Canada,</i>

04:16.798 --> 04:21.302
<i>we remind you for your personal safety,</i>
<i>be prepared to brace.</i>

04:22.178 --> 04:28.226
We are six years, nine months
and 26 days from departure.

04:28.309 --> 04:33.564
At the tone,
the exact time will be 0800 hours.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.364
Step back. Move back.

04:42.031 --> 04:43.574
Down in front. Hit the floor.

04:43.658 --> 04:44.826
-Get on the floor!

04:53.543 --> 04:54.669
Both gates are open.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.337
-Santiago.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.589
-Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

05:01.801 --> 05:05.263
Hey, hey! Sit down and calm down.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.181
-Where's the other cart?
-That's it for today.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.349
- What?
-Yeah, you better get used to it.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.267
Half rations?

05:09.350 --> 05:11.019
- Oi. Don't talk back!
- You can't do this.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.603
We're starving as it is.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.815
We have children back here!
How can we live?

05:19.444 --> 05:20.403
Bullshit!

05:20.987 --> 05:22.196
We'll do the best
with what we've got.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.032
Mama Grande,
you wanna take care of the food?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.621
Okay, take another deep breath, John.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.380
Okay, on to death and taxes, everyone.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.424
We need one-tenth from everyone.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.594
Five to feed the rats,
five to feed Strong Boy.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.346
He's fit for us all, eh?
Take your time on that today, eh?

05:47.430 --> 05:49.182
-Come on.
- You smashed that yesterday.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.768
You need it more than me.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.312
- Thanks, Josie.
-It's all right.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.067
-Hey, hey, hey! Give it back!

05:59.901 --> 06:01.569
-No! No! It's mine!
-Come on, go back.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.782
You gotta go get the rat rations.

06:05.865 --> 06:06.699
I will.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.619
Gina only had four pups this time.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.413
- Well, what's our surplus?
- Uh, 42.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.998
Hey, not bad.

06:14.749 --> 06:18.628
All right, what else?
What's Old Ivan got you doing?

06:19.420 --> 06:21.881
Sines, cosines and tangents.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.382
Trigonometry. All right.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.719
Those kind of skills will get you
apprenticed up out of here.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.974
-You really think I can be an engineer?
-Hey...

06:33.226 --> 06:34.477
I know you can.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.523
Come on, Layton, let's get this done.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.527
You're a good man, Miles.
Never forget who you are.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.153
A Tailie.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.493
Right here. We take this car,

06:50.576 --> 06:52.703
and we can have access
to the electrical junctions.

06:52.787 --> 06:56.249
Now, Lights says we can back-surge
from there, cutting power to Ag-Sec.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.544
Layton, how are our Jackboots?

07:00.419 --> 07:01.587
They're getting sloppy,

07:01.671 --> 07:04.006
leaving both gates open
for up to a minute, ten.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.342
Okay, Strong Boy's ready to go.

07:06.425 --> 07:09.137
We got one minute, ten
to get to the next car.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.431
We only gotta take four
to access the electrical junction.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.351
Yeah, but we might not take out
any essential systems at all.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.354
We just don't know enough
about the infrastructure.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.983
We know what? Maybe a dozen cars,
a few back here by us,

07:22.066 --> 07:23.734
a few more up around Sanitation.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.947
The only Tailie who has ever been
north of the Nightcar is Old Ivan here.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.825
I will never be too old to remember

07:30.908 --> 07:34.287
the day they pulled me uptrain
to tune a piano.

07:34.370 --> 07:38.916
It played beautifully
except for one dead key, middle C.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.462
-I guess no one remembered to bring--
-To bring piano wire, yeah.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.923
With all due respect, we heard it before,
and this doesn't exactly fill the belly.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.049
Pike's right.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.677
If we don't do something soon,
it's gonna be too late.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.972
-They just cut our rations again.
-No doubt.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.391
It's like slavery is the only reason
they still feeding us at all.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.769
They're starving us to extinction.
They're sterilizing our women.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.730
There hasn't been a child born
in the Tail in five years.

08:00.813 --> 08:05.485
I say we fight. I wanna be a dad.
Guys, I'm the Last Australian.

08:05.568 --> 08:09.697
Now, before long,
they are gonna cut our food for good.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.658
We have informants
in half a dozen different sectors, okay?

08:12.742 --> 08:14.243
-We are building networks--
- Layton,

08:14.327 --> 08:16.412
-there is no time for that now.
- It's not enough, man.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.039
Y'all remember the year three rebellion?

08:19.040 --> 08:22.502
We fought like an army,
but we were blind at every door.

08:23.085 --> 08:26.380
We had no help from the other side.
Sixty-two dead.

08:26.464 --> 08:30.676
Thirteen arms taken in punishment.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.598
We need help. We need alliances.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.476
You know
what I think, Layton?

08:38.559 --> 08:42.146
I think you don't got the guts
to stand with us.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.607
Pike, you can question my plan
if you want.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.735
You question my fight,
and we got a serious problem.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.781
Oh, there's no problem...

08:52.782 --> 08:53.908
if we're one Tail.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.537
Hey, we are one Tail.
We're at the end of our rope.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.956
That's right, so we got no choice.

09:00.039 --> 09:04.460
We do this now before they toss us again
and find the weapons.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.836
- Exactly.
- That's right.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.713
- One Tail, Layton.
- One Tail!

09:07.797 --> 09:08.631
- One Tail, man.
- One Tail.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.258
One Tail.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.097
Come on, Layton.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.852
One Tail.

09:37.994 --> 09:38.995
Layton.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.289
Look, I...

09:42.248 --> 09:43.165
Sorry.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.293
I know you want
to move things slower, but--

09:45.376 --> 09:47.003
We just need to think long-term
about this.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.714
There is no long-term
if we're too old and sick to fight.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.175
I don't want you
on the front line tomorrow.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.803
We're gonna be all right.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.747
Heavenly Father, we come to you
in a time of need

10:22.830 --> 10:25.499
because we need you now more than ever.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.670
We ask for your divine protection. Amen.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.323
Here.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.744
You will do better with this than me.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.790
Resistance is never futile,

11:05.873 --> 11:12.588
but Wilford's train
is a fortress to class.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.551
Maybe it is perpetual.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.763
I know you don't believe that.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.401
Good luck, my boy.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.403
Good luck, Ivan.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.968
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Good morning.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.719
- Good morning, Melanie.
-Good morning.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.600
Good morning. How are you today?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.352
- Wonderful.
- Thank you for asking.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.645
- Good morning, Martin.
-Morning.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.230
-Come on, guys. We're done.
-Good morning, Mr. Lam.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.569
My congee was quite good,

12:16.652 --> 12:17.528
-thank you for asking.
- Oh, no.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.864
You're not allowed to have
better Cantonese than me.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.657
- Oh, no, I don't.
- Let's go.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.535
-Come on. We're gonna be late, again.
- Good morning, Folgers.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.164
-Ruth.
-Uh, some concerns about the sauna.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.457
Oh, no.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.250
I'll send Maintenance right away.

12:31.333 --> 12:35.463
No, it's not broken.
The Europeans are body-shaming again.

12:35.546 --> 12:39.175
Americans and the rest of the world
prefer bathing attire.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.135
It's just easier.

12:41.218 --> 12:44.638
The Scandinavian royals
take great pleasure in defying the rules.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.558
- And they sing sauna songs.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.518
I sauna to relax.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.896
I'm sure there's a scheduling solution.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.691
-We can look at it next committee meeting.
-Perfect.

12:55.774 --> 12:56.775
Thank you.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.110
How's your parfait, LJ?

12:58.694 --> 13:00.988
I wanna go to Third Class
for noodles again today.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.700
Oh, you better not go to Third now.
There's more violence, I heard.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.243
Ah, well, that's nothing but track talk.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.703
Melanie,
what's going on down there?

13:07.786 --> 13:10.873
The Brakemen responded to something.
That's all we know at this point.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.042
Probably just Third settling scores.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.793
We'll update you as soon as possible.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.177
York. Just had to open his mouth.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.388
All right, well, bad news travels fast.
You better get down there.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.601
I was hoping to avoid the Tail this week.

13:30.684 --> 13:34.104
Oh, go on. You know you love an excuse
to wear your fur.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.215
Two Brakemen, six Jackboots.

14:05.886 --> 14:09.473
- Hospitality and six more Jacks.
-Hospitality? What do they want?

14:09.557 --> 14:11.433
Don't know. Do we abort?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.643
-Hold for the signal.

14:18.482 --> 14:21.026
Step back. Hit the floor.

14:37.459 --> 14:38.711
Good morning.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.925
Mr. Wilford, and all of us here
at Wilford Industries,

14:45.801 --> 14:48.596
bid you good morning,
as I just said before.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.389
Sorry. I'm, I'm... I'm sorry.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.645
We have a removal request.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.773
Mr. Andre Layton.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.234
What? What?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.695
Please make yourself known.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.282
Hold.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.537
Hold.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.039
Hold.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.625
-Hey, hey, hey. It's all right.
-What do you want with him?

15:17.708 --> 15:19.543
-No, no, no. What do you want? Stop.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.086
Settle down!

15:21.170 --> 15:22.171
Layton!

15:24.298 --> 15:26.508
No! Hey! What do you want
with me?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.177
Stop. What do you want with me?

15:28.802 --> 15:30.137
Layton! Layton!

15:30.721 --> 15:32.723
Take me back! Take me back!

15:33.474 --> 15:36.560
No! Take me back!

15:44.026 --> 15:46.278
Here you go, little guy. Mmm-hmm.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.031
Stop.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.032
Mouth.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.533
"Ahh."

15:55.162 --> 15:56.664
Open.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.833
-Good boy.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.813
Hey, what do you want me for?

16:21.480 --> 16:22.731
Till, right? What's going on?

16:24.441 --> 16:26.485
Shut your Tailie mouth
and keep walking.

17:24.626 --> 17:25.669
Come on.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.714
-Where are we?
- Third Class mess hall.

18:12.633 --> 18:16.386
Mr. Layton, I'm Lead Brakeman Roche.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.864
We've heard that, in the old life,
you were a homicide detective.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.450
We've had a murder.

19:23.162 --> 19:23.996
Aren't you cops?

19:24.079 --> 19:26.999
Most of us were Wilford Security.
Some were...

19:28.000 --> 19:30.586
-Soccer players?
-Midfielder.

19:34.089 --> 19:38.177
I guess Mr. Wilford didn't think
rich people would murder each other.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.430
You were a cop, though.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.725
Detroit PD.

19:45.642 --> 19:46.685
I'm sorry.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.438
Heard it got rough out there.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.482
-The department turned on itself.
-It was rough everywhere.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.904
-Hey, you got another bowl?
- No.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.906
We've got a body.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.043
You okay?

20:12.169 --> 20:13.170
Hey.

20:14.838 --> 20:17.799
I packed his worldly possessions
so no one steals them.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.261
"His worldly possessions"?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.271
Climbing up into the mountains again,
aren't we?

20:32.397 --> 20:33.565
The Cascades.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.360
-It's rough track.
-Yeah.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.197
Now I have to get that apprenticeship.

20:41.114 --> 20:45.744
Nah. I think we need you here in the Tail.
You're our Miles and Miles.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.748
People don't come back, Mom.
Somebody has to go find Layton.

20:50.332 --> 20:54.169
Layton will be okay.
If anyone can get back to us, it's him.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.060
Y'all got some serious problems up here.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.814
So I think they cut him up into pieces
to hide him better.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.152
That's my theory, anyway.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.199
Sean Oren Wise.
Third Class, worked in Agriculture.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.411
- Who found him?
- Tunnelman, doing maintenance.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.705
What do y'all have up here
in the way of forensics?

21:29.788 --> 21:33.041
There's no real crime lab or anything,
but we have access to some scientists.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.461
What about his, um... his dick?

21:39.589 --> 21:43.677
The Freeze cut your career short at what?
First-year rook?

21:44.511 --> 21:45.804
I wanted to make homicide.

21:45.887 --> 21:50.225
Yeah? Well, you made Brakeman,
so you can figure this out for yourself.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.019
-Take me back to the Tail.
-Hang on.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.480
This is your chance, mate.

21:55.564 --> 21:56.565
Take it.

21:57.274 --> 22:00.652
-Why would you wanna go back there?
-So they know I'm not a traitor.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.613
They'll slit your throat now, man.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.701
Clean up your own shit.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.413
Oi. I've got one for you.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.916
What do coppers and football players
have in common?

22:15.751 --> 22:17.419
You mean soccer players?

22:17.502 --> 22:19.004
-Nothing.
- No, no.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.757
Come on, Detective. Cops and footie.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.009
What's in common?

22:26.970 --> 22:30.515
A good stiff boot!

22:30.599 --> 22:32.184
All right, hey. Osweiller, that's enough.

22:33.685 --> 22:34.603
-Penalty kick!

22:34.686 --> 22:36.646
-What the hell is this?

22:38.940 --> 22:40.817
He was getting
mouthy with us, sir.

22:40.901 --> 22:41.818
Sorry, sir.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.571
The Tailie's uncooperative.
Says he won't help with the investigation.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.198
Oh, and you thought a beating
would convince him?

22:46.281 --> 22:47.908
I think your partner has some issues.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.994
You two idiots step out. Now.

22:53.789 --> 22:57.042
You go back to your doghouse in the Tail.
Double shift.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.252
-Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

23:03.298 --> 23:06.301
- All right, you pain in the ass.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.428
This is Melanie from Hospitality.

23:09.012 --> 23:13.558
My apologies, Detective,
on behalf of Wilford Industries.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.229
You're the voice of the train.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.150
I am. I am. I wear several hats.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.986
My department's responsible
for smooth relations.

23:32.577 --> 23:33.620
Detective...

23:34.788 --> 23:38.041
I'm here to tell you personally

23:38.792 --> 23:41.086
that Mr. Wilford
wants this solved quickly.

23:41.169 --> 23:44.714
Doors will open
wherever your investigation leads you.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.095
Oh, shit.

23:50.178 --> 23:51.680
Two years ago, there was another victim.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.349
Male, genitals removed.

23:54.432 --> 23:57.394
Someone's already serving time
in the Drawers for it.

23:57.978 --> 24:01.148
So, either you got a copycat...

24:02.691 --> 24:05.861
or Mr. Wilford put the wrong person
in the Drawers.

24:08.363 --> 24:11.032
I'll do it for rations
and Third Class immigration for the Tail.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.826
You're not entitled
to anything here.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.578
The passengers had tickets.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.496
-All the crew had jobs.
-Lead Brakeman--

24:16.580 --> 24:19.749
-You Tailies boarded the train like rats!
-Lead Brakeman. Lead Brakeman, please!

24:20.834 --> 24:21.668
Would you uncuff him?

24:25.797 --> 24:26.965
Please.

24:29.801 --> 24:33.388
This must be very disconcerting to you.
Really, it's simple.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.974
You are the only homicide detective
on the train.

24:36.975 --> 24:41.563
And so, Mr. Wilford
is asking you to contribute.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.025
Doctor.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.154
These are the Drawers, Detective Layton.

25:34.282 --> 25:38.286
And this is Nikki Genêt,
sentenced for murder.

25:39.663 --> 25:40.997
She's innocent, isn't she?

25:41.081 --> 25:42.332
Why do you say that?

25:42.415 --> 25:44.251
She just looks it.

25:44.834 --> 25:46.711
I've taken special care of her.

25:46.795 --> 25:50.548
She would be the longest Sleeper
we've ever brought out of suspension.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.841
Over two years under.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.760
And she's our only witness
to the first murder.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.554
You want justice, Detective? Clear her.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.182
And if you catch the killer,

25:59.266 --> 26:01.685
we'll make you train detective
and move you to Third Class.

26:02.852 --> 26:06.523
Um, they take a while to recover,
and I really need

26:06.606 --> 26:07.691
-the notary present--
-Just make it happen.

26:09.025 --> 26:09.859
Yep.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.324
I'm not agreeing to anything.

26:18.576 --> 26:21.329
Well, I'm gonna leave you
in Mr. Roche's hands for now.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.540
He'll take you to the suspects.

26:30.380 --> 26:35.093
Sean Wise's roommates reported him missing
24 hours before he was found.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.511
Welcome to the Chains, Tailman.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.723
-"Chains"?
- Yeah. It's a thing now.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.809
Young people mostly,
living and screwing in groups.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.144
Chains.

26:44.853 --> 26:48.440
They took some chopped-up containers,
got creative with them.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.817
Bunch of freaks if you ask me.

26:51.693 --> 26:55.113
My wife also has some choice descriptors,
but I think you're gonna love 'em.

26:56.197 --> 26:59.326
We have Sean Wise's partners
waiting for you.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.411
I believe one of them you've already met.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.460
Tomato soup and a grilled cheese.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.171
Hello, Zarah.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.172
Hi, Andre.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.343
Get these two out of here.
I'll start with her.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.095
You'll be fine.
We haven't done anything wrong.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.681
You're not a Tailie.
Don't let him treat you like one.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.766
Don't worry, okay?

27:24.100 --> 27:27.062
Come on, Tino. Come on, let's go.
Come on, Tino.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.567
Uncuff her. Give us a minute alone.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.361
Yeah, buddy, this isn't a conjugal.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.613
-Sure isn't.
-It's motivation.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.366
You need to do your new job
like Mr. Wilford wants.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.659
She's a suspect. Prove it isn't her.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.869
It's been five years.

27:42.952 --> 27:45.997
Give us a minute alone
or this is as far as I go.

27:52.879 --> 27:53.922
Well.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.178
Maybe you two can patch things up.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.390
The room is yours, Detective.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.564
-You told them I was a cop?
-Someone I love was murdered.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.441
You were the only person
I could think of to help.

28:13.525 --> 28:17.195
It's just like the Tail up here.
There is no process, just punishment.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.656
They could pin Sean's murder on one of us.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.283
Jesus, they might never let me go back.

28:23.243 --> 28:27.288
Good. You're out. Isn't that
what you wanted for your revolution?

28:27.372 --> 28:28.415
Hey.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.501
I didn't choose to leave, like you.

28:31.584 --> 28:34.671
Turn your back on us
so you could go work in the Nightcar.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.592
-You forced all this on us.
-Zarah...

28:39.676 --> 28:42.387
It was 40 degrees below in June
and still dropping like a stone.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.139
Yeah, I remember. You wanted to die.

28:44.222 --> 28:47.058
You said, "Don't give up."
You could get us onto <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

28:47.142 --> 28:50.353
Like somehow your cop connects were gonna
get us seats with the billionaires.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.064
How stupid was I?
I could've gone with my mom.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.275
We could have joined your brother,
died together,

28:55.358 --> 28:57.026
like people we admired were doing.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.946
But instead, you made me live. For what?

29:01.156 --> 29:02.907
For the hell of the Tail?

29:02.991 --> 29:06.286
You don't for a second
have the right to judge my choices.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.414
You know how hard it is
to find love on this train.

29:10.498 --> 29:12.292
Yeah, not very, apparently.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.966
I bet you bunked with Josie
the moment I was gone.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.304
No, I didn't.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.476
We just survived.

29:42.405 --> 29:45.450
When they came for him, he called "hold."

29:47.285 --> 29:49.370
And you hesitated, too.

29:50.371 --> 29:52.373
There were twice the Jackboots
we expected.

29:54.584 --> 29:55.960
We think he knew it was coming.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.632
He didn't know. You saw him fighting.

30:00.715 --> 30:04.594
Well, one way or another, he's gone,

30:05.178 --> 30:06.763
everything shifts,

30:07.847 --> 30:09.432
you find yourself...

30:11.267 --> 30:12.519
a new place.

30:16.689 --> 30:17.732
You get that?

30:19.442 --> 30:22.445
Oh, yeah. I got it all, Pike.

30:23.696 --> 30:24.697
Good.

30:25.824 --> 30:26.991
Good to hear.

30:42.841 --> 30:43.842
Now what?

31:06.489 --> 31:11.244
But plants didn't always
grow here in Ag-Sec.

31:12.120 --> 31:16.082
Actually, before everything was frozen,
they grew in the ground!

31:17.917 --> 31:19.294
I know, it's true.

31:19.377 --> 31:25.216
And that's why it's very important
to learn about seeds and plants,

31:25.300 --> 31:29.679
so that one day, we can grow food
on a warm Earth again.

31:30.638 --> 31:34.017
All right, children, move it along.
Watch your step.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.146
All this...

31:38.730 --> 31:40.189
you can't even share.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.942
There's 130 more cars
just like it.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.737
And, no, we can't.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.157
Oh! There you are.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.536
You really pulled out
all the stops, huh?

31:54.495 --> 31:56.039
Using my ex as leverage.

31:56.122 --> 31:58.875
Oh, show the Tailie some food,
he'd probably do anything.

32:00.501 --> 32:02.420
How did it go with the suspects?

32:03.421 --> 32:06.716
Zarah didn't kill Sean Wise.
I give you that one for free.

32:06.799 --> 32:09.093
And there is way more to this
than you're saying.

32:09.677 --> 32:12.597
Otherwise, why would you be
so desperate for my help?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.307
Well, of course there's more to it.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.062
Everything on Mr. Wilford's train
is connected.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.940
A murder could upset
the entire ecosystem.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.358
It's complex.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.568
That might be interesting for you.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.780
Oh, everything up here
is interesting to him. He's all eyes.

32:28.863 --> 32:31.950
Then participate, and stay.

32:32.033 --> 32:36.204
Reunite with Zarah.
That's on the table for you both.

32:37.038 --> 32:42.335
You need me because this murder
threatens Mr. Wilford's precious order.

32:42.418 --> 32:45.004
Well, if you wanna keep eating
your damn strawberries,

32:45.088 --> 32:46.464
you know my demands.

32:47.006 --> 32:50.343
Third Class calories, space,
and reproductive rights for the Tail.

32:50.426 --> 32:53.262
Well, he just added that one, okay?
Now they wanna breed back there?

32:53.346 --> 32:55.264
This looks like abundance to you.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.016
It isn't.

32:58.518 --> 33:02.772
This is strawberry crop 12,
in a balanced rotation of 14.

33:03.481 --> 33:07.735
This berry represents
five or six kilocalories.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.321
Sugars, dietary fiber, vitamin C.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.908
Its place here is commensurate
with these values.

33:15.576 --> 33:20.081
Now, strawberries, they're susceptible
to soil fungi, nematodes.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.126
So are we, actually.
You, me, everyone on this train.

33:23.876 --> 33:26.212
So we don't let these proliferate either.

33:26.921 --> 33:31.092
Everything here survives
at the mercy of his balance.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.803
And the truth is...

33:38.141 --> 33:40.101
you need Wilford's strawberries...

33:42.020 --> 33:43.354
more than he needs you.

33:44.313 --> 33:47.650
<i>♪ Happy birthday, Old Ivan ♪</i>

33:47.734 --> 33:50.611
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

33:52.113 --> 33:53.614
- Eighty-four years old.
- Yeah!

33:53.698 --> 33:55.450
Oldest man on Earth,
for all we know.

33:55.533 --> 33:56.868
What would you like, <i>viejo?</i>

33:56.951 --> 34:01.581
There is only one extravagance
that I would wish for my birthday.

34:01.664 --> 34:02.832
What's that, old fella?

34:03.916 --> 34:04.917
Privacy.

34:06.294 --> 34:11.966
To be alone for one hour
with the Rachmaninoff recording.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.469
-Lights?
-Mmm.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.180
-You know the one.
-Yeah, the only one.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.391
All right, you heard him. Everybody out.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.146
Happy birthday.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.440
Happy birthday.

34:29.984 --> 34:32.820
You've just gotta
leave the phone plugged in.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.114
-The phone's got almost no battery.
-Mmm-hmm.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.117
Thank you, Lights.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.945
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

35:57.113 --> 35:58.656
What's going on?

36:00.950 --> 36:02.160
Oh, please, no.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.202
No.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.973
How was the harvest?

37:06.057 --> 37:08.726
I thought the boss could use
some comfort food tonight.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.354
I bet you can use a drink.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.111
What should we toast to?

37:19.195 --> 37:22.782
How about whatever
is making you smile so much right now?

37:23.449 --> 37:24.617
Or is it whomever?

37:25.368 --> 37:26.327
Is it that obvious?

37:28.788 --> 37:30.248
Oh, you're beaming.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.292
But there's something I have to tell you.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.505
I'm bringing Nikki Genêt
out of the Drawers.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.134
We locked up the wrong person.
I have no choice.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.387
How bad will she be?

37:44.470 --> 37:46.639
Two years in there. Won't be pretty.

37:46.722 --> 37:49.725
Will you monitor her? Work with Klimpt?

37:50.309 --> 37:51.310
Learn what you can.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.354
And if people start asking
the wrong questions?

37:53.437 --> 37:57.358
I'll handle that.
Then, once this murder's solved,

37:58.609 --> 38:00.069
the other work can continue.

38:00.152 --> 38:04.365
Well, then, we better drink
to your detective. May he take the case.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.367
He'll take the case.

38:12.331 --> 38:15.960
We were ready to cut their throats
before they took Layton.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.129
-Now Ivan?
- Preach.

38:18.212 --> 38:19.338
Man, we stick to the script.

38:19.422 --> 38:21.841
We finish what we started. Yeah? Huh?

38:21.924 --> 38:24.051
By ax and pike,

38:24.135 --> 38:25.428
like we always have.

38:25.511 --> 38:26.721
Yeah!

38:26.804 --> 38:29.432
-For Old Ivan! Let's do this!

38:29.515 --> 38:30.808
-Old Ivan!
- Okay.

38:31.392 --> 38:34.312
Here's what we're gonna do
to open that door.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.662
- How?
- He hanged himself.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.373
Another? Leave it to the next watch.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.625
Containment protocol.
We gotta remove the body.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.389
Oh, my goodness.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.311
Nothing like mountain weather
to agitate everyone further.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.443
One day at a time, Ruth.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.409
Good evening, passengers.

39:31.202 --> 39:36.540
Be advised, track conditions
will deteriorate over the next 24 hours.

39:38.167 --> 39:41.921
<i>Remain safe and prepare to brace.</i>

39:43.172 --> 39:45.299
<i>-From Mr. Wilford...</i>
-Pikes.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.510
<i>...and all of us at Wilford Industries...</i>

39:49.261 --> 39:50.262
good night.

39:52.473 --> 39:53.641
Right.

40:05.569 --> 40:06.570
Ramp.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.155
Hold steady. Hold steady.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.449
Ready? Ready?

40:21.919 --> 40:25.172
Just what this day was missing,
another corpse.

40:26.298 --> 40:29.009
-You strip off the clothes?
-<i> Sí.</i>

40:35.808 --> 40:37.810
- Oi! No.
-Give them a moment.

40:38.644 --> 40:40.729
-You wanna let them do that?
-Give them a moment.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.154
All right, let's see the body. Come on.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.573
- All right, back it up.
- Let's go. Back it up.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.116
-Move.
- Move back.

41:02.835 --> 41:05.087
-Go! Go! Go! Go!

41:06.839 --> 41:09.592
Go! Go! Go! Go!

41:24.106 --> 41:25.274
Osweiller, help!

42:10.152 --> 42:11.946
Taking me back to the Tail now, Roche?

42:12.029 --> 42:15.533
No. You're going to my lockup.
I'm going home to my wife.

42:15.616 --> 42:19.245
I gotta get back there, man.
The Tail's all I got in the world.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.878
Doors!

43:03.831 --> 43:04.957
- Move it.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.310
It's crazy out there, man.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.273
-What is he doing here?
- What happened?

43:29.356 --> 43:31.775
-They got Till as a hostage.
-Now we've got one, too.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.736
Commander! Let him go.

43:33.819 --> 43:36.905
-The Tailies have revolted again.
-Yes. Mr. Wilford is aware.

43:36.989 --> 43:39.033
Look, whoever they are, I know 'em, okay?

43:39.116 --> 43:40.576
-I can help.
- This is going too far with him--

43:40.659 --> 43:42.703
Please. They'll listen to me.

43:46.957 --> 43:50.878
-Bastard, I know who you are.
-Yeah. I remember you, too.

43:55.257 --> 43:58.510
Three minutes. Then we kill you all.

44:08.854 --> 44:12.316
Tailies! Who's left? It's Layton.

44:12.399 --> 44:13.901
Layton, you're a coward!

44:17.404 --> 44:18.572
Pike?

44:26.664 --> 44:28.165
We don't want you here!

44:34.713 --> 44:37.383
- I'm coming in.
- No, you're not!

44:37.466 --> 44:38.467
Who's with you?

44:43.222 --> 44:44.306
Whoa, whoa.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.810
Hey, hey. Hey, boys.

44:56.235 --> 44:57.194
How's it going?

44:57.277 --> 44:59.613
-Yo, Layton, where you coming from, man?
- Uptrain, man.

44:59.696 --> 45:01.949
Yo, they pulled me up to solve a murder.
You believe that?

45:02.032 --> 45:04.368
They're killing each other up there.

45:04.952 --> 45:05.828
Bullshit.

45:07.454 --> 45:08.455
You're a traitor!

45:09.998 --> 45:11.542
This only ends one way.

45:16.046 --> 45:19.633
Yeah. They're gonna storm in here,
and they're gonna butcher us.

45:19.716 --> 45:21.427
- Two minutes!
-Oh, God damn it, man--

45:21.510 --> 45:23.303
-Shut up, Z!
- Yo, I got a family, man.

45:23.387 --> 45:27.182
I've got a wife and a kid
on this train, Pike.

45:27.766 --> 45:29.101
Old Ivan offed himself, man.

45:29.893 --> 45:30.727
What?

45:31.311 --> 45:33.814
He hung himself with an electrical cord.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.817
That's what sparked this whole thing.

45:40.028 --> 45:45.868
Pike, whatever happened between us,
we're brothers.

45:48.328 --> 45:50.831
I think I got a way
we get out of this alive.

46:04.970 --> 46:07.139
-Hey. Till.

46:07.222 --> 46:09.850
It's okay. It's okay.

46:10.434 --> 46:11.477
Huh?

46:12.186 --> 46:14.021
-Uh-uh. Hey.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.857
There you go. It's all right.

46:20.569 --> 46:22.446
-I'm sorry.
-What?

46:22.529 --> 46:24.364
-It's okay. Easy.
-What are you doing?

46:24.448 --> 46:26.617
Here's what you do.
Surrender yourself to the Drawers.

46:27.326 --> 46:28.202
-What?
-No way.

46:28.285 --> 46:29.661
-No way.
-It's like sleep. It's like sleep.

46:29.745 --> 46:31.163
-They put you to sleep.
-Okay. For how long?

46:31.246 --> 46:32.331
It's a goddamn coffin!

46:32.414 --> 46:36.919
Listen to me. By my count,
I went uptrain 130 cars today, okay?

46:37.628 --> 46:39.421
I've seen shit
none of us could've imagined.

46:40.047 --> 46:44.134
I can piece together schedules,
security detail, all right?

46:46.136 --> 46:47.638
Old Ivan dreamed of this.

47:00.275 --> 47:01.860
Look at the blood.

47:04.738 --> 47:06.281
We only made it one car.

47:09.618 --> 47:11.954
I'm done. I'm done, Layton.

47:12.037 --> 47:14.456
Hey. One Tail.

47:15.332 --> 47:17.376
We need you uptrain,

47:18.544 --> 47:22.798
waiting for the day we take the Engine.

47:29.846 --> 47:32.015
We'll drawer
the remaining three rebels indefinitely.

47:32.099 --> 47:33.475
No, the Drawers won't do.

47:33.559 --> 47:37.145
Mr. Wilford demands swift justice
when order is attacked.

47:37.229 --> 47:38.730
Six men. I want six heads.

47:38.814 --> 47:42.276
-Then you'll have six more martyrs.
-And round and round we go again.

47:43.944 --> 47:44.861
I'll do it.

47:48.740 --> 47:50.284
I'll solve your murder.

47:51.285 --> 47:53.579
I will get Mr. Wilford his order back.

47:55.122 --> 47:56.999
And you can have mercy on the Tail.

47:59.710 --> 48:02.379
Mr. Wilford will want
an example made immediately.

48:02.462 --> 48:07.092
But... there is to be
no more loss of life.

48:07.676 --> 48:10.387
In the morning,
Ruth will take a significant arm.

48:10.470 --> 48:13.223
Spectacle.
At least it'll make an impression.

48:13.307 --> 48:15.309
You're in a tight spot, Mr. Layton.

49:47.025 --> 49:48.527
You're in my chair.

49:50.696 --> 49:54.157
Sorry, boss. All's well.
I was just leaving you a report.

49:54.241 --> 49:55.450
Mmm.

49:56.076 --> 49:59.162
You have a rough day
stewarding the future of humanity?

49:59.246 --> 50:02.874
Oh, I could start, but I won't.

50:06.169 --> 50:07.421
Hell yeah.

50:07.504 --> 50:10.716
Why doesn't she do those
smoked salmon avocado rolls anymore?

50:12.217 --> 50:13.844
No more avocados?

50:15.303 --> 50:19.307
No more wood chips for the smoked salmon.

50:20.392 --> 50:22.018
-That's shitty.
-Uh-huh.

50:22.102 --> 50:23.395
No more wood chips.

50:26.231 --> 50:28.316
-It's gonna be bumpy tomorrow.
-Yeah.

50:29.276 --> 50:31.445
I hate this stretch of track.

50:33.947 --> 50:34.781
Thanks, Ben.

50:35.532 --> 50:38.326
You have the train, Mr. Wilford.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.204
I have the train.

50:42.748 --> 50:47.502
<i>♪ Where the angels ♪</i>

50:47.586 --> 50:51.715
<i>♪ Wait to join us ♪</i>
