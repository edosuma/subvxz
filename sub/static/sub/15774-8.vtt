00:04.834 --> 00:06.786
<i>Oh, hey, what's your home phone number?</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:08.961
The same as your home phone number.

00:09.153 --> 00:09.770
Oh.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.149
What are you doing?

00:12.212 --> 00:13.123
I got a new phone.

00:13.243 --> 00:14.810
What happened to your old phone?

00:14.844 --> 00:17.312
Toilet. What's Porky's number?

00:17.347 --> 00:19.114
You don't know Porky's phone number?

00:19.149 --> 00:21.750
No, he calls me.
But this way, when he calls,

00:21.785 --> 00:23.945
I'll recognize the number,
and I'll know not to answer it.

00:23.980 --> 00:27.825
5550815.

00:27.859 --> 00:29.552
What's his last name?

00:29.586 --> 00:33.685
You don't know Porky's
last name? It's Pig.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.853
Pig? Are you kidding? Ha ha!

00:36.888 --> 00:38.620
I thought that was his nickname.

00:38.655 --> 00:41.893
That is fantastic. Pig. Pugh.

00:41.928 --> 00:43.434
How do you spell that?

00:48.513 --> 00:58.832

01:07.672 --> 01:09.573
What's up, doc?

01:09.608 --> 01:12.875
Hello there, neighbor.
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:12.910 --> 01:15.410
But would you mind signing
this here petition?

01:15.445 --> 01:16.511
What's it for?

01:16.546 --> 01:18.814
Oh, you know. Stuff.

01:18.848 --> 01:22.387
Sam, I don't just sign something
without knowing what it is.

01:22.421 --> 01:24.657
Hey, will you sign this?

01:24.692 --> 01:25.892
Sure.

01:25.926 --> 01:27.527
Come on. What about you?

01:27.562 --> 01:29.296
What is it for?

01:29.331 --> 01:33.267
Trying to get the
courts to give me my guns back.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.103
You're kidding.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.674
If I get enough signatures
saying that I'm a good neighbor

01:37.708 --> 01:41.278
with no anger issues and promises
to use firearms responsibly,

01:41.312 --> 01:43.414
then they got to give me my guns back.

01:43.448 --> 01:46.184
I wonder why they took 'em
away in the first place.

01:47.954 --> 01:51.023
Can you hold the elevator?

01:51.057 --> 01:53.426
What do you mean
I'm not tall enough to ride?

01:53.460 --> 01:56.730
I'm a grown man!

01:56.764 --> 01:59.300
I said dressing on the side!

02:01.203 --> 02:04.473
I have no idea.
So will you sign it?

02:04.507 --> 02:07.210
- No.
- Hmm.

02:10.747 --> 02:15.852
So it's not even short for
anything like Pigman or Pigstein?

02:15.887 --> 02:17.487
It's just Pig?

02:17.522 --> 02:19.724
Here's your food.
And here's the bill.

02:19.758 --> 02:22.126
I included the gratuity this time.

02:25.130 --> 02:28.366
Salad? Since when
do you eat salad?

02:28.400 --> 02:31.836
I-I'm trying to eat healthier.
I'm in training.

02:31.870 --> 02:34.072
I-I signed up for the marathon.

02:34.106 --> 02:37.342
The marathon?
You're not athletic.

02:37.376 --> 02:41.080
I know. B-but it's something
I've always wondered

02:41.114 --> 02:42.482
if I could do.

02:42.516 --> 02:44.517
I know the answer to that.
You can't.

02:44.551 --> 02:46.453
I'm actually an ok runner.

02:46.487 --> 02:48.988
Ah, prove it.
Let's go outside and race.

02:49.023 --> 02:50.824
Oh, I-I--

02:50.858 --> 02:52.192
What, are you scared?

02:52.227 --> 02:53.861
N-no. I'm not scared.

02:53.895 --> 02:56.063
I thought you were
a pig not a chicken.

02:56.097 --> 02:57.898
- I am. I'm just--
- Just what?

02:57.933 --> 03:00.802
Afraid you'll lose?
Well, you will.

03:00.837 --> 03:03.806
- Fine.
- Ooh! It's on!

03:03.840 --> 03:08.511
Who wants to come outside and watch
me whip this pig in a footrace?

03:10.882 --> 03:14.952
Huh. I guess they already
know I'm going to win.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.391
G-good race.

03:19.425 --> 03:23.295
You may have won the battle,
but I'm going to win the war.

03:23.330 --> 03:25.297
What war?

03:25.332 --> 03:28.534
The marathon. I'm entering it.

03:28.569 --> 03:31.671
Oh, great.
I-I'll have someone to run with.

03:31.705 --> 03:33.673
Not great.
I'm going to beat you.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.909
I'm sure a lot of people will beat me.

03:35.944 --> 03:37.477
I just want to finish.

03:37.512 --> 03:40.214
You'll finish all right...
Behind me.

03:40.248 --> 03:42.550
And you'll have lost the war.

03:42.584 --> 03:44.352
There's no war.

03:44.386 --> 03:46.254
Oh, yes, there is.

03:46.288 --> 03:48.590
And you just lost the first battle.

03:48.624 --> 03:50.825
I thought you said I won the battle.

03:50.860 --> 03:54.497
I said you won the war.
But I will win the battle.

03:54.531 --> 03:56.198
- Who won?
- I did.

04:02.472 --> 04:04.340
I'm going for a run.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.509
Whoa! My phone!

04:06.544 --> 04:09.513
It's got my tunes on it.
Elton John's greatest hits.

04:09.547 --> 04:11.281
Since when do you run?

04:11.316 --> 04:14.652
Since Porky decided to turn
my whole world upside down.

04:14.686 --> 04:15.987
What are you talking about?

04:16.021 --> 04:18.923
- Porky entered a marathon.
- So?

04:18.958 --> 04:22.461
- So he's not the jock. I am.
- You're the jock?

04:22.495 --> 04:26.232
Look, in our circle of
friends, we all have our rolls.

04:26.267 --> 04:29.436
You're the average Joe, the everyman.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.805
Porky's the nerd, the loser.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.308
And I'm the jock, the hunk.

04:34.343 --> 04:35.710
That makes sense.

04:35.744 --> 04:38.880
Can't hear ya. Elton John.

04:46.488 --> 04:49.790
Dag gummit. Unh.

04:49.824 --> 04:52.893
Card sarn it! Unh.

04:55.964 --> 04:58.131
Lose something?

04:58.166 --> 04:59.933
Give me that.

05:02.771 --> 05:06.173
Oh. This is just the kind of
thing you need a gun for.

05:06.208 --> 05:09.010
I would've blasted that darn
smoke detector to bits.

05:09.044 --> 05:11.613
I ain't slept in 3 nights.

05:11.647 --> 05:16.719
Every time I starts to fall
asleep, beep, beep, beep.

05:16.753 --> 05:18.254
You just need to change the battery.

05:18.288 --> 05:21.690
Get down from there.
What are you doing?

05:21.724 --> 05:23.492
I'm taking the battery out.

05:23.526 --> 05:28.297
No one asked for your help!
Oh, great! Now I owe you one.

05:28.331 --> 05:29.665
You got another battery?

05:29.699 --> 05:32.034
No, I don't get another battery.

05:32.068 --> 05:34.570
- I've got one.
- No, you already done enough!

05:34.604 --> 05:36.905
Fine.
Let me know when you get one.

05:36.939 --> 05:38.506
And I'll come over
and put it in for you.

05:38.541 --> 05:41.843
Uh-uh. I already owe you
for taking it out.

05:41.877 --> 05:44.112
I ain't gonna owe you double
for putting another in.

05:44.146 --> 05:48.617
Yosemite Sam don't like
owing nothing to nobody!

05:50.820 --> 05:52.587
What about that stack of bills?

05:52.622 --> 05:54.589
Those are faceless corporations.

05:54.624 --> 05:57.125
Now, what kind of cake do you like?

05:57.160 --> 06:00.395
- What?
- I'm baking you a cake to pay you back.

06:00.430 --> 06:02.164
I don't know. Carrot?

06:02.198 --> 06:03.665
Well, you're getting chocolate.

06:03.699 --> 06:06.334
It's the only one I know how to make.

06:06.369 --> 06:08.302
You're welcome.

06:08.337 --> 06:11.940
They found him lying
in the middle of the road.

06:11.974 --> 06:15.043
He's severely dehydrated,
but we're getting fluids in him.

06:15.077 --> 06:16.778
So he should be fine.

06:16.813 --> 06:18.480
Why'd you call me?

06:18.514 --> 06:23.151
You were his "In case of
emergency" on his cell phone.

06:26.589 --> 06:29.457
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

06:29.492 --> 06:31.325
I'm your
"In case of emergency?"

06:31.360 --> 06:32.693
What about Bugs?

06:32.728 --> 06:34.262
No, no, no, no.

06:34.296 --> 06:36.597
You're the dependable one.
Cool in a crisis.

06:36.631 --> 06:39.432
Bugs is the uptight one,
the stick in the mud.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.201
What are you talking about?

06:41.235 --> 06:43.737
In our friendship circle,
you're the dependable one.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.540
Bugs is the uptight one.
Porky's the buffoon.

06:46.574 --> 06:49.676
And I'm the stud.
Hey, you're fast, right?

06:49.710 --> 06:52.179
I'm the fastest mouse
in all of Mexico.

06:52.213 --> 06:55.149
Can you teach me to be the
fastest mouse in all of Mexico?

06:55.183 --> 06:56.717
Or at least faster than Porky?

06:56.751 --> 06:58.285
I doubt it. Why me?

06:58.319 --> 07:01.054
Because you're
the helpful one, the Saint.

07:01.089 --> 07:02.856
I thought you said
I was the dependable one.

07:02.891 --> 07:05.159
No.
Porky's the dependable one.

07:05.193 --> 07:06.994
I thought Porky was the buffoon.

07:07.028 --> 07:09.963
- No, Bugs is the buffoon.
- I confused.

07:09.998 --> 07:12.199
That's because
you're not the smart one.

07:12.233 --> 07:15.502
I'm the smart one.
So will you help me?

07:15.536 --> 07:18.871
- Fine.
- I knew I could count on you.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.575
That's why you're the stud.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.544
I'm going to pass out.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.941
That nitwit! Daffy, call 911!

07:48.986 --> 07:52.756
What in tarnation
are you doing here?

07:52.790 --> 07:54.658
You didn't change the battery,
did you?

07:54.692 --> 07:57.360
- What?
- Your house is on fire!

07:57.395 --> 08:00.830
I must've left the stove on,

08:00.865 --> 08:04.000
baking your cake.

08:04.034 --> 08:05.669
We got to get out of here!

08:05.703 --> 08:08.672
Eh. Wait.

08:08.706 --> 08:11.007
Let me throw on some jeans.

08:11.042 --> 08:14.878
No, not these. They pinch.
Where's my good pair.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.046
Ah. They're in the hamper.

08:17.081 --> 08:19.449
Sam, we're gonna die.

08:19.483 --> 08:21.417
Your cake!

08:21.452 --> 08:22.819
Forget the cake!

08:22.853 --> 08:26.722
No way. I ain't staying
in debt to you.

08:43.807 --> 08:45.174
Unh!

08:56.118 --> 09:00.087
Hello. Hello.
Yosemite. Yosemite.

09:00.121 --> 09:02.489
Hello. It's me, Dr. Weisberg.

09:02.523 --> 09:06.559
That was some fire.
You're lucky to be alive.

09:06.594 --> 09:10.263
Thanks to this guy.
You really owe him one.

09:10.298 --> 09:12.332
- No, no, no, no.
- Unh.

09:12.366 --> 09:16.135
Oh. Oh, hey. You know, your
friend was in the other day.

09:16.170 --> 09:18.571
- Who?
- You know, your friend.

09:18.605 --> 09:20.673
The hunk. The jock.

09:20.707 --> 09:23.376
- Who?
- Come on, the stud.

09:23.410 --> 09:26.212
Eh, forget it.

09:26.246 --> 09:28.614
Hey, doc, will you sign this?

09:28.649 --> 09:30.149
Trying to get my guns back.

09:30.184 --> 09:32.719
What are you, nuts?

09:32.753 --> 09:35.521
Sure you don't want to reconsider?

09:35.556 --> 09:37.257
I'm sure.

09:37.291 --> 09:40.360
But if you need a place to say
until your house is fixed...

09:40.394 --> 09:43.897
Oh, no!
I already owe you plenty.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.965
Sam, you don't owe me anything.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.802
I wish that were true, believe you me.

09:48.836 --> 09:51.571
But the fact of the matter is
you saved my life.

09:51.605 --> 09:53.673
And everyone knows
the only way to repay someone

09:53.708 --> 09:56.676
who saves your life is to save theirs.

09:56.710 --> 09:58.645
My life's not in any danger.

09:58.679 --> 10:00.547
You don't know that.

10:00.581 --> 10:02.982
Think I thought my life was in danger

10:03.017 --> 10:04.317
when I went to sleep last night
with the stove on,

10:04.351 --> 10:06.819
pan full of grease next
to stack of newspapers

10:06.854 --> 10:08.621
I was thinking about recycling?

10:08.656 --> 10:15.294
No, siree. You saved my life.
So now I gots to save yours.

10:18.331 --> 10:21.367
How about last night, huh?
That Bugs is a real hero.

10:21.401 --> 10:23.769
Bugs isn't the hero.
He's the nerd.

10:23.803 --> 10:26.005
You're really not getting
this friendship circle thing.

10:26.039 --> 10:27.740
Ok. If you're going
to run a marathon,

10:27.774 --> 10:30.142
you need endurance
and proper technique.

10:30.177 --> 10:32.245
Here, watch me.

10:34.448 --> 10:36.415
- Like that.
- Like what?

10:36.450 --> 10:38.351
Go. So I can see it.

10:38.385 --> 10:40.219
Are you kidding?
I just did it.

10:40.254 --> 10:41.654
I didn't see anything.

10:41.689 --> 10:45.025
Fine. I do it again slower.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.894
- There.
- What? Go.

10:47.928 --> 10:51.632
Ok.
I go in slow motion this time.

10:51.666 --> 10:54.501
Pay attention to my stride
and my posture.

10:56.905 --> 10:58.906
Wow. You're fast.

10:58.940 --> 11:00.507
How come you don't enter the marathon?

11:00.542 --> 11:03.543
Because it wouldn't be fair.
If I enter, I win.

11:03.577 --> 11:05.111
Give someone else a chance. Heh.

11:05.146 --> 11:08.648
I guess I am the Saint.
Ok. Give me a couple laps

11:08.682 --> 11:10.850
so I can see what I'm working with.

11:10.885 --> 11:12.486
Go.

11:14.788 --> 11:16.356
How do I look?

11:16.390 --> 11:19.325
Like a woman wearing
high heels carrying a purse.

11:19.360 --> 11:24.130
Oh...

11:24.164 --> 11:26.533
How far did I go?

11:26.567 --> 11:27.700
Like, 10 feet.

11:27.735 --> 11:29.635
How many feet are in a marathon?

11:29.669 --> 11:32.138
Like 137,000.

11:32.172 --> 11:34.273
Hi, guys.

11:35.909 --> 11:40.746
There he goes. The hunk.
I'll never beat that jock.

11:40.780 --> 11:46.085
What a stud.
What a dependable, smart stud.

11:53.426 --> 11:55.161
Aah!

11:55.195 --> 11:57.296
- Don't worry! I'll save you!
- What?

11:57.331 --> 12:01.634
You're choking.
I got to give you the heimlich.

12:01.669 --> 12:03.936
That's not the heimlich!

12:06.173 --> 12:08.341
I'm not sure what the heimlich is.

12:08.375 --> 12:10.176
But I'm saving your life.

12:10.210 --> 12:13.379
I'm not choking.

12:14.514 --> 12:16.515
I saw you cough.

12:16.550 --> 12:18.250
Were you watching me?

12:18.285 --> 12:21.019
It's all I been doing.
I can't sleep!

12:21.054 --> 12:22.754
First, it was the smoke detector.

12:22.789 --> 12:26.025
Now, it's the burden of repaying
this soul-crushing debt.

12:26.059 --> 12:28.728
You should've let me die.

12:28.762 --> 12:30.663
I hate you.

12:30.697 --> 12:33.800
But I will not rest
until I save your life.

12:33.834 --> 12:37.437
And then I can go back to just being
your bad neighbor with anger issues.

12:37.471 --> 12:38.772
You want to sign this again?

12:38.806 --> 12:42.275
Sure.

12:46.648 --> 12:50.285
Careful. There's a bunch of
broken glass everywhere.

12:50.319 --> 12:53.222
Ok. Let's see here.
Today, you need 3 jumping Jacks,

12:53.256 --> 12:56.091
1 sit up, and half a push up.

12:56.126 --> 12:58.928
That's better than yesterday.
What are you drinking?

12:58.962 --> 13:02.666
Energy drink.
Got to replace my electrolytes.

13:02.700 --> 13:06.203
It's root beer. Man, you got to
be serious about your nutrition.

13:06.237 --> 13:08.171
You got to think of your body
as a machine.

13:08.206 --> 13:10.741
Nutrition is the fuel. What's a
typical day of food for you?

13:10.775 --> 13:12.643
Well, I start
with a sensible breakfast.

13:12.677 --> 13:15.279
- What?
- A bunch of powdered sugar on a hotdog.

13:15.313 --> 13:17.749
That's not sensible.
That is insensible.

13:17.783 --> 13:20.585
- What about lunch?
- Usually turkey sandwich on wheat.

13:20.619 --> 13:22.253
Ok. That's pretty good!

13:22.287 --> 13:23.554
I just deep-fry that sucker

13:23.589 --> 13:26.357
and dump a bunch of powdered
sugar on top.

13:26.391 --> 13:27.992
I'm scared to ask
what you eat for dinner.

13:28.026 --> 13:30.428
I like a big dinner.
Helps me sleep.

13:30.462 --> 13:31.762
I'll take a casserole dish, you know,

13:31.796 --> 13:33.297
something big and deep.

13:33.331 --> 13:35.099
Pour about 2 inches
of powdered sugar in there,

13:35.133 --> 13:38.703
a rack of baby back ribs,
a layer of marshmallows.

13:38.737 --> 13:41.038
More powdered sugar,
'til it's about ye high.

13:41.072 --> 13:43.574
Throw that dude in the microwave
for about 45 minutes,

13:43.608 --> 13:46.978
sprinkle with powdered sugar
and serve.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.914
That's what you eat for dinner?

13:49.948 --> 13:54.084
Well, I supplement throughout
the day with these protein bars.

13:54.119 --> 13:56.720
That's a tube of cookie dough.

13:59.391 --> 14:01.959
Look at him go.
Look at that commitment.

14:01.993 --> 14:06.664
That's why he's the buffoon.

14:08.867 --> 14:10.234
Hi, Mr. Bunny.

14:10.269 --> 14:12.804
Oh, hey, gossamer.
What can I do for you?

14:12.838 --> 14:15.273
My teacher is wondering if
you'd come and talk to my class

14:15.307 --> 14:17.242
about what it's like to be a hero.

14:17.276 --> 14:18.877
Oh, sure. When will you--

14:18.911 --> 14:20.445
Aah!

14:20.479 --> 14:22.246
Now we're even Steven.

14:22.281 --> 14:23.981
What are you talking about?

14:24.015 --> 14:26.384
Well, you were about
to get eaten by a monster.

14:26.418 --> 14:30.254
That's gossamer. He's our neighbor.
And he's 9 years old.

14:30.288 --> 14:32.289
So I didn't just save your life?

14:32.323 --> 14:35.459
No. Put him down!

14:37.896 --> 14:39.897
You help me get my guns back?

14:39.931 --> 14:42.099
My mom says I'm not allowed
to talk to you.

14:44.335 --> 14:49.172
How about one more?

14:49.207 --> 14:53.076
Careful.
There's a big net out here.

14:59.604 --> 15:00.771
Hello.

15:00.805 --> 15:01.905
Hey, Porky.

15:01.940 --> 15:04.741
Oh, hey, Bugs. What's up?

15:04.775 --> 15:06.876
I have a favor to ask of you.

15:06.911 --> 15:08.111
Anything.

15:08.145 --> 15:10.113
I need you to hit me with your car.

15:12.416 --> 15:13.916
Come on, touch your toes.

15:13.951 --> 15:15.184
I can't.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.686
Flexibility is the key
to a proper stride.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.822
You got to get your hamstring
stretched out.

15:19.856 --> 15:23.793
This is as far as I can go.

15:25.629 --> 15:27.964
Are y-you sure about this?

15:27.998 --> 15:31.668
Don't worry. Someone's going to
save me before you actually hit me.

15:36.641 --> 15:38.776
Oh, I see you.

15:38.810 --> 15:40.911
Ok. Good. Now I'm going
to enter the intersection.

15:40.945 --> 15:43.914
But don't slow down.
It's got to look real.

15:43.948 --> 15:46.516
It's burning.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.985
I bet that stud Porky Pig
can touch his toes.

15:49.020 --> 15:53.656
I'm the stud!

15:53.691 --> 15:56.960
Aah!

16:02.867 --> 16:05.335
You got one friend who nearly
gets you killed in a fire.

16:05.369 --> 16:07.738
And another who hits you with his car.

16:09.474 --> 16:11.208
You got to get some new friends.

16:11.243 --> 16:14.345
Except for that one guy.
The hunk. The jock.

16:14.379 --> 16:17.014
He's a keeper.

16:17.049 --> 16:19.818
Well, there's only one thing
left to do.

16:19.852 --> 16:21.786
Stop trying to save my life?

16:21.821 --> 16:25.657
No. Try 10 times as hard!
From here on out,

16:25.692 --> 16:28.461
I'm a-never leaving your side!

16:29.730 --> 16:32.098
Ok. Visiting hours are over.

16:32.132 --> 16:35.035
Well, see you tomorrow.

16:35.069 --> 16:37.103
Oh, hey, will you sign this.

16:37.138 --> 16:39.139
Well,
I-I need to read it first.

16:39.173 --> 16:40.707
Forget it.

16:40.741 --> 16:42.876
- How you feeling?
- Good. Strong.

16:42.910 --> 16:45.511
- You do your stretching?
- Yep. All stretched out.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.180
What did you have
for breakfast this morning?

17:16.778 --> 17:18.945
Eggs. Just like you told me.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.952
Oh, no. Thank you.
It wouldn't be fair.

17:25.987 --> 17:28.822
Give someone else a chance.
After all, I'm the Saint.

17:28.856 --> 17:31.691
Wait a second.
I'm not the Saint.

17:31.725 --> 17:34.660
I'm the fastest mouse
in all of Mexico. I'm the jock!

17:34.695 --> 17:36.662
Give me a number.

17:37.897 --> 17:39.732
Good morning, runners.

17:39.766 --> 17:42.401
Welcome to the 53rd Annual
Royal Oaks...

17:45.439 --> 17:51.778
And here now to start the race
is local hero Bugs Bunny.

17:57.051 --> 17:59.420
Now, in 30 minutes,
I'll give you the signal.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.755
And you'll fire this starter's
pistol into the air,

18:01.790 --> 18:03.190
starting the race.

18:03.225 --> 18:06.260
Oh...

18:27.083 --> 18:28.850
What is wrong with you?

18:28.884 --> 18:32.654
I saved your life!
He was about to shoot you dead!

18:32.688 --> 18:35.189
No, you idiot!
That's not a real gun.

18:35.224 --> 18:37.925
That's a starter's pist--

18:37.960 --> 18:42.930
I mean, thank you.
You saved my life.

18:42.964 --> 18:46.200
So the debt's been paid?
We're square?

18:46.234 --> 18:48.335
We're square. Totally square.

18:48.369 --> 18:51.571
Now, can I please start the race?

18:51.606 --> 18:55.842
Sorry, rabbit.
It's been too long.

18:55.876 --> 18:58.812
Yee-haw!

19:03.551 --> 19:05.919
It's not even a real gun!

19:07.789 --> 19:09.924
Hey. I'm done.

19:11.894 --> 19:13.661
Unh. Oh.

19:13.696 --> 19:15.297
W-what happened?

19:15.331 --> 19:17.466
I must've had some bad eggs.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.101
L-let me get you some help.

19:19.135 --> 19:23.205
No. You need to finish.
This is your dream.

19:23.239 --> 19:26.341
I should've been a good friend
and supported you.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.676
I'm just going to have
to get used to the idea

19:28.711 --> 19:32.280
that you're the jock
and I'm the loser.

19:32.315 --> 19:34.015
- B-but--
- Go!

19:34.050 --> 19:38.753
Go, you dependable, uptight,
hunky, loser stud.

19:38.787 --> 19:41.389
I'm n-not finishing
without you.

20:02.110 --> 20:05.546
I can't believe you carried
Daffy 23 miles.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.547
What an incredible gesture.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.782
He would've done the same for me.

20:09.817 --> 20:12.818
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

20:12.853 --> 20:17.089
Look! You can clearly see my feet
crossing the finish line before you.

20:17.123 --> 20:18.490
That means I won.

20:18.524 --> 20:21.359
The circle of friendship
is finally restored.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.796
I am the stud.
You're the buffoon.

20:24.830 --> 20:26.531
You're the uptight one.

20:26.566 --> 20:29.000
And you're...the mouse.

20:29.034 --> 20:32.504
The mouse? I thought you said
I was the dependable one.

20:32.538 --> 20:35.373
He's really not getting this
friendship circle thing, is he?

20:35.408 --> 20:37.275
Then again, he's not the smart guy.

20:37.310 --> 20:39.144
I'm the smart guy.

20:39.179 --> 20:42.214
And the Saint and the jock.

20:42.248 --> 20:44.983
The hunk. The dependable one.

20:45.018 --> 20:48.620
The golden boy.
The gifted child.

20:53.293 --> 20:57.596
You can have my gun when
you pry it from my cold dead--

20:59.465 --> 21:02.868
What's the big deal?
It was a starter's pistol.

21:02.902 --> 21:04.336
There weren't no bullets in it.

21:04.371 --> 21:06.572
I wouldn't act that way
with a real gun.

21:06.606 --> 21:07.974
I promise.

21:09.676 --> 21:12.344
What about all these signatures?
