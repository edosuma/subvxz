00:01.234 --> 00:04.738
(somber electronic music)

00:12.012 --> 00:14.282
(fizzling)

00:19.687 --> 00:23.023
(electronic beat music)

01:03.164 --> 01:04.397
Careful.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.233
Okay.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.564
(mechanical buzzing)

01:38.832 --> 01:40.668
Good morning, GL-13.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.538
Good morning.

01:44.538 --> 01:48.176
(pleasant electronic music)

01:56.684 --> 01:59.687
Okay, Darren, what's
the emergency?

01:59.687 --> 02:01.589
Why did you have to bring her?

02:01.589 --> 02:03.023
She's my lawyer.

02:03.023 --> 02:06.059
You won't be seeing me without
her until we've settled.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.329
I just wanted to speak
to you on your own

02:08.329 --> 02:09.729
so that we could sort
something out, you know?

02:09.729 --> 02:11.899
That's not how it works, Darren.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.367
- [Darren] I'm not
talking to you.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.302
Then we're done.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.304
Wait.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.908
We've put our case forward.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.611
There are no grounds
for negotiation, Darren.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.112
Look,

02:25.112 --> 02:27.448
please listen to me, I--

02:27.448 --> 02:29.149
It's too late.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.584
You hit me, Darren.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.520
You were cheating on me.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.356
This has been taken
all out of context.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.524
What happened--

02:36.524 --> 02:39.026
No, Darren, you
think I was cheating.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.261
You got an idea in your head

02:40.261 --> 02:42.630
and you treated me like garbage.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.632
Will you listen to me?

02:44.632 --> 02:47.501
You were running around
trashing my name,

02:47.501 --> 02:51.439
my reputation, destroying
my future with these lies.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.207
Unbelievable!

02:53.207 --> 02:55.209
So this is what it's all about?

02:55.209 --> 02:58.246
You've been so precious
about your silly reputation.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.181
This is about what
you did to me.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.689
What do we do?

03:08.689 --> 03:09.857
We'll see you in court.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.062
(ominous music)

03:23.337 --> 03:25.573
(thudding)

03:28.909 --> 03:30.644
Good evening, darling.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.914
Would you like me
to do anything?

03:40.187 --> 03:41.021
Yes.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.291
I want you to stay there.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.163
Look at the state of you.

03:56.370 --> 04:00.574
You've been running around,
trashing my fucking name,

04:00.574 --> 04:03.311
telling everybody that
I've been doing this.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.546
(mechanical buzzing)

04:05.546 --> 04:07.281
And this.

04:07.281 --> 04:08.115
And this!

04:11.218 --> 04:12.920
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

04:17.958 --> 04:20.394
You want my money, don't you?

04:21.394 --> 04:23.897
I'm sorry, money?

04:25.433 --> 04:27.968
Would you like me to
withdraw money for you?

04:34.542 --> 04:36.377
You know what to do.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.714
Go on, beg for you life.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.751
(ominous music)

04:43.751 --> 04:46.019
(thudding)

04:46.954 --> 04:48.856
[Mechanical Woman] No, please!

04:48.856 --> 04:50.123
Fuck you!

04:50.123 --> 04:51.725
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Stop, don't kill me.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.626
Bitch!

04:52.626 --> 04:53.461
Fuck you!

04:54.462 --> 04:55.696
Fuck you!

04:55.696 --> 04:56.864
[Mechanical Woman]
Stop, it hurts.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.933
It hurts, it, it, it, it hurts.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.769
I'm sorry, it hurts.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.438
(ominous music)

05:14.448 --> 05:17.284
(water trickling)

05:35.302 --> 05:37.805
(eerie music)

05:45.513 --> 05:48.248
(water sloshing)

06:01.261 --> 06:04.164
(foreboding music)

06:22.416 --> 06:25.152
(water sloshing)

06:42.536 --> 06:45.038
What the hell are you doing?

06:46.507 --> 06:50.478
You should dry off
before you catch a cold.

06:50.478 --> 06:53.146
(ominous music)

06:55.716 --> 06:57.685
No, no, no.

06:57.685 --> 07:02.623
(groaning)
(electrical fizzling)

07:03.356 --> 07:06.159
(heartbeat thumping)

07:08.829 --> 07:11.264
You seem agitated.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.334
(groaning)

07:14.334 --> 07:17.505
(electrical fizzling)

07:27.748 --> 07:30.484
(drain gurgling)

07:43.564 --> 07:45.032
You still wanna go?

07:46.233 --> 07:48.301
Sure, it looks amazing.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.604
Tokyo looks like it's
already in the future

07:50.604 --> 07:53.206
and then we can go out, see
some of the country side.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.842
Then that settles
it, we're going.

07:54.842 --> 07:55.809
Oh, are we?

07:56.644 --> 07:57.978
When?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.379
Soon.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.681
How soon is soon?

08:00.681 --> 08:02.149
Within the year.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.619
I reckon just in time
for our next anniversary.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.054
You're serious?

08:07.054 --> 08:08.822
You're gonna book us tickets
for Japan, aren't you?

08:08.822 --> 08:11.859
Actually, I thought, seeing
how this is the 21st century,

08:11.859 --> 08:13.260
you might offer to pay.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.762
Equality and all that.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.864
Oh, right, and how does
that work out as equal?

08:16.864 --> 08:18.666
I paid for the last vacation.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.167
A wet weekend Torquay?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.235
In the worst hotel in the world!

08:22.235 --> 08:24.705
Don't pretend you
didn't love Torquay

08:24.705 --> 08:26.640
and those thin walls.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.776
(laughing)

08:28.776 --> 08:30.277
Oh, it was amazing.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.313
You can not be pleased.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.148
(laughing)

08:35.148 --> 08:37.885
Okay, fine, no sunny Torquay.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.385
No strolling through the sand

08:39.385 --> 08:41.388
littered with junk
food and trash.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.890
Oh my God, it's such
a dream destination.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.526
No more watching couples
fighting on the beach.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.428
No more blistering
English sun hitting down

08:48.428 --> 08:51.264
on the white British
white bodies.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.967
Don't take this away from me,
I'm already regretting it.

08:53.967 --> 08:57.137
The families arguing over who
bought the last ice cream.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.338
The freezing beaches.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.172
No!

08:59.172 --> 09:01.341
(laughing)

09:03.577 --> 09:04.912
You all right?

09:06.146 --> 09:06.980
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.717
Don't worry.

09:09.717 --> 09:13.520
Seriously, I can't wait
to travel with you.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.555
I've already booked.

09:16.857 --> 09:17.658
What?

09:19.126 --> 09:21.929
You'll just have to remember
to sort our itineraries out,

09:21.929 --> 09:24.064
pack my case, find my passport.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.370
Jokes aside,

09:31.972 --> 09:34.074
I'm glad we gave it a go.

09:34.074 --> 09:38.011
Well, you did have a gun to
my head, so I had no choice.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.046
You ass.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.150
I have a surprise for
you when we get home.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.252
Really?

09:45.252 --> 09:46.954
Not that.
(laughing)

09:46.954 --> 09:47.788
What is it?

09:49.389 --> 09:52.660
Wait and see or else
it won't be a surprise.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.361
(laughing)

09:54.361 --> 09:55.562
What're you laughing at?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.765
What are you finding funny?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.402
(laughing)

10:09.009 --> 10:13.313
I honestly can not
remember where we parked.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.748
Let's just get a cab.

10:15.883 --> 10:16.817
I'm not feeling great.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.318
It's fine, we'll find it.

10:20.053 --> 10:20.888
Come on.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.068
- [Man] Excuse me.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.239
Come on, just leave
it, keep moving.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.542
Ang.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.178
He might need our help.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.183
Hey.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.657
Evening.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.859
Evening.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.194
Wow, you're gorgeous.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.430
- [Ang] Are you okay?

11:03.430 --> 11:04.297
- [Man] I'm good.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.135
You wanted us for something?

11:08.135 --> 11:09.536
I was just wondering
where you and your brother

11:09.536 --> 11:10.738
were heading to.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.105
I'm her husband.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.040
Really?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.241
Lucky man.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.211
Punting a bit, aren't we?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.915
That's a shame, I could
show you a good time.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.616
Sorry, buddy, we gotta go.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.218
I'm not your buddy.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.555
(eerie music)

11:29.422 --> 11:30.991
Sorry.

11:30.991 --> 11:31.892
It's really late.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.227
I apologize, darling.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.462
Could you just do
me a quick favor

11:35.462 --> 11:37.430
and let me know
what the time is?

11:37.430 --> 11:38.265
Mine's dead.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.568
It's just gone midnight.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.635
Cheers.

11:42.635 --> 11:43.470
Hey!
No!

11:43.470 --> 11:45.005
- [Husband] Get off!

11:45.005 --> 11:46.406
- [Ang] No, Rick!

11:46.406 --> 11:48.441
(thudding)

11:48.441 --> 11:51.378
(ominous music)

11:51.378 --> 11:53.513
(huffing)

12:09.529 --> 12:12.933
(melancholy organ music)

12:43.663 --> 12:45.833
(sighing)

12:47.901 --> 12:50.203
It was a nice service.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.004
Thanks.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.445
Heard you got a dog.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.246
What is his name?

13:00.647 --> 13:01.915
Her name's Cathy.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.353
It was a surprise for Angelique.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.462
How's the injuries healing?

13:17.064 --> 13:17.898
Getting there.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.702
(phone ringing)

13:22.702 --> 13:24.838
Sorry, gotta take this.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.507
(phone ringing)

13:34.181 --> 13:35.715
All right.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.384
All right, if you need me
to come in, I'll come in.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.519
I'm supposed to be in a funeral.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.353
All right.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.490
Sorry, buddy, I
gotta go, it's work.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.127
Thanks for coming.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.798
Take care, man,
look after yourself.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.306
See you, mate.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.042
Look after him, Jo, all right?

14:02.042 --> 14:03.576
Bye, John.
See ya.

14:09.649 --> 14:13.921
You look like you
could do with a drink.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.455
Thanks.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.725
How long are you
gonna take off work?

14:18.725 --> 14:20.994
Work's too important right now.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.063
I got two big clients
close to signing.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.298
Rick, I don't think
you can handle it.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.600
You need to give
yourself time to grieve.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.269
I've come to terms with it.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.005
She's gone, she's
never coming back.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.473
She'll always be with you.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.178
Just remember, I'm still
your big sister, okay?

14:38.178 --> 14:39.846
Don't isolate yourself.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.649
You can come stay with us.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.517
You're always family.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.653
I'll clean up
everything here, okay?

14:48.755 --> 14:49.589
Okay.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.426
Come on, let's get
back to the apartment.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.310
(ominous music)

15:10.310 --> 15:12.479
(gasping)

15:35.602 --> 15:36.436
Hey, Rick.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.173
Sorry to hear about your wife.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.375
Very sad news.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.013
I've had enough of this city.

15:46.013 --> 15:46.913
Thank you, Barry.

15:49.682 --> 15:50.950
I got your card.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.120
That was good of you.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.790
This is my girlfriend, Anna.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.327
Say hello, Anna.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.395
Hello.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.399
Nice to meet you, Anna.

16:06.399 --> 16:10.103
Anna's been keeping
me very busy.

16:15.742 --> 16:16.576
Sorry.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.279
That was inappropriate.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.781
Forget it.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.219
I better get going.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.054
Hold on.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.059
I still have Angelique's
old recipe book.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.562
The handwritten one
with all the pictures.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.332
Something to remember her by.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.502
I'll go get it for you.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.071
Thanks.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.538
I'll only be a second.

16:47.140 --> 16:47.974
Anna,

16:49.842 --> 16:52.845
keep Rick entertained, will you?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.047
My pleasure, darling.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.060
Do you like the building?

17:08.060 --> 17:08.961
It's beautiful.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.233
And the apartment?

17:16.703 --> 17:17.569
It's beautiful.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.115
Have you seen the rooftop?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.583
Yes.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.484
What do you think?

17:33.553 --> 17:34.387
It's beautiful.

17:37.023 --> 17:37.857
It sure is.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.200
Barry?

17:54.107 --> 17:55.275
She look after you?

17:56.843 --> 17:57.677
Uh...

17:58.611 --> 18:01.814
She's quite something, Barry.

18:01.814 --> 18:02.782
You're a lucky man.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.585
Luck,

18:06.653 --> 18:09.289
luck has nothing to do with it.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.259
Something you might
consider yourself.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.328
Thanks.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.764
I'll be sure to check it out.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.967
You won't regret it.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.038
I better get going.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.377
See you later, Barry.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.920
(ominous music)

18:49.662 --> 18:50.497
Hey!

18:55.635 --> 18:59.138
You can't be drinking
in a public space.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.975
Where's your car?

19:02.975 --> 19:03.810
Car?

19:05.345 --> 19:08.548
I don't know, I think it
might be on another floor.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.651
- [Guard] You can't
drive in that state.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.520
I'm fine.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.658
I'll just sleep on the floor
and go home in the morning.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.493
Come on, you need to leave.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.664
It's you.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.003
Look, Rick, you need
to stop doing this.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.209
I'll give your sister
a call, all right?

19:50.990 --> 19:53.260
- [Rick] What're you doing here?

19:53.260 --> 19:55.295
- [Joanna] Sorting
this place out.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.866
What happened last night?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.202
- [Joanna] You don't remember?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.238
I remember walking
through the town.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.008
Next thing I remember,

20:11.010 --> 20:12.279
waking up on the couch.

20:18.485 --> 20:22.889
Rick, you almost had
a mental breakdown.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.859
I had to come and fetch
you from the car park.

20:28.628 --> 20:31.030
You were lucky
the security guard

20:31.030 --> 20:32.999
had recognized who you were.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.770
Otherwise, you would've almost
been dealing with police.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.810
(sighing)

20:49.816 --> 20:51.751
Getting drunk isn't the way.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.921
She wouldn't need
to self-destruct.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.391
That isn't what she'd want.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.297
Would you like me to
stay with you today?

21:04.297 --> 21:05.298
It's okay.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.034
I should get to work.

21:09.836 --> 21:10.770
If you're sure.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.440
It'll keep me busy.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.442
That's good, I guess.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.732
You want me to do
the washing up?

21:41.233 --> 21:43.102
I got the glove for you.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.637
Hey.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.539
Angelique, hey.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.508
I guess I'm just
talking to myself then.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.145
(knife chopping)

21:57.216 --> 21:58.017
Angelique?

22:05.291 --> 22:07.960
(ominous music)

22:08.928 --> 22:11.097
(yelling)

22:15.702 --> 22:18.204
(eerie music)

22:19.639 --> 22:21.808
(gasping)

22:38.391 --> 22:41.828
(computer keys clicking)

22:46.232 --> 22:49.168
She can be your
poolside drinking buddy.

22:49.168 --> 22:52.805
The perfect companion
for a sweaty workout.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.707
Take her home to meet your mum.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.510
Classy dinner for two?

22:57.510 --> 22:59.579
She'll laugh at your every joke.

23:01.013 --> 23:04.383
Hi, I'm Don Daniels and
I'm here to introduce you

23:04.383 --> 23:05.952
to the GR Models.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.955
The latest in groundbreaking
cyborg technology

23:08.955 --> 23:11.323
from Cybertech Solutions.

23:11.323 --> 23:12.258
Good morning, Kim.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.162
Good morning, Don.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.229
Gorgeous.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.731
Isn't she?

23:18.731 --> 23:21.000
(upbeat music)

23:21.000 --> 23:22.469
Now, if she was a real woman,

23:22.469 --> 23:25.171
I'd be getting arrested
right about now.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.338
But she isn't real,

23:26.338 --> 23:28.908
so I can do anything
I like to her.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.478
(upbeat music)

23:35.347 --> 23:38.618
The guys here are busy
designing beautiful outer shells

23:38.618 --> 23:40.920
for the girl of your dreams.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.523
But the really beauty
comes from the personality.

23:44.557 --> 23:47.193
Because true beauty lies within.

23:49.529 --> 23:52.264
The complex CPUs are
meticulously designed

23:52.264 --> 23:54.266
to house a lot of information.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.235
As much as a human brain.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.638
Plus, the learning
capabilities allow for

23:58.638 --> 24:00.807
emotional and
behavioral development

24:00.807 --> 24:03.976
but all the while
keeping you in control.

24:03.976 --> 24:07.446
Ask yourself this, "What do
I want from a companion?"

24:09.181 --> 24:10.883
Maybe you want that
beautiful woman

24:10.883 --> 24:12.819
you couldn't get in real life.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.254
Maybe you want to go on a
date with that art teacher

24:15.254 --> 24:16.589
you always thought was hot.

24:17.624 --> 24:18.791
Maybe you've lost a loved one

24:18.791 --> 24:20.660
and you want to bring them back.

24:22.662 --> 24:26.198
From the complex personality
profile upload process

24:26.198 --> 24:29.769
to a our photo mapping and
unique characterizations,

24:29.769 --> 24:31.303
at Cybertech Solutions,

24:31.303 --> 24:34.807
we bring your loved
ones back, better.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.409
Read all about the terms
and conditions and pricing

24:37.409 --> 24:39.411
and you won't regret it.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.047
My name is Don Daniels.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.182
Have a Don Dan-dazzling-day!

24:49.321 --> 24:51.490
(sighing)

24:55.995 --> 24:59.231
(ominous cinema music)

25:03.836 --> 25:06.405
Don't go in there, you idiot!

25:12.879 --> 25:15.915
Can stay at mine this
weekend, if you want to.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.484
No, I'll just get in the way.

25:18.484 --> 25:20.687
I'll probably be doing
paperwork anyway.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.790
No one would think less of you

25:23.790 --> 25:25.391
if you started dating again.

25:28.494 --> 25:31.297
I don't have the time or the
mindset for that right now.

25:38.370 --> 25:42.008
I was thinking of
something else.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.111
What?

25:46.212 --> 25:47.446
You'll laugh.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.782
No I won't, I promise, what?

25:50.883 --> 25:51.718
Cyborg.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.253
(chuckling)
What do you mean?

25:54.253 --> 25:55.588
What's a cyborg?

25:56.522 --> 25:57.890
I'm serious.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.760
Where on earth would
you get a cyborg from?

26:00.760 --> 26:01.961
Barry next door has one.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.163
I need chocolate.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.865
This is too weird to comprehend.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.366
Jo.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.969
- [Joanna] Is this a
sex thing or something?

26:09.969 --> 26:11.638
Not really.

26:11.638 --> 26:12.939
For me, anyway.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.809
Really, so do you know
how they honestly work?

26:16.809 --> 26:19.646
(Joanna laughing)

26:29.455 --> 26:31.791
You're not serious, are you?

26:33.359 --> 26:35.594
(laughing)

26:36.796 --> 26:39.398
(suspenseful cinema music)

26:39.398 --> 26:42.568
(woman on TV gagging)

27:47.834 --> 27:50.269
Whatever the cause,
feeling lonely,

27:50.269 --> 27:52.204
wanting the girl of your dreams,

27:52.204 --> 27:54.807
this stuff actually works!

27:54.807 --> 27:59.178
They delivered me the
perfect girl, my dream girl,

27:59.178 --> 28:00.412
all through the mail!

28:00.412 --> 28:04.183
Yes, the girl of my
dreams through the mail!

28:04.183 --> 28:05.852
She can be how anyway you want,

28:05.852 --> 28:07.419
she can look anyway you want

28:07.419 --> 28:10.156
and she will do
anything you want.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.758
Legit anything.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.785
(knocking)

28:54.733 --> 28:57.303
(somber music)

29:51.657 --> 29:53.025
(computer chiming)

29:53.025 --> 29:56.195
Don Daniels here and
congratulations on purchasing

29:56.195 --> 29:58.865
a fully customizable GR Model.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.400
Hi, Kim.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.434
Hi, Don.

30:02.434 --> 30:06.172
(faint beat music)

30:06.172 --> 30:07.106
Lovely, isn't she?

30:08.274 --> 30:09.808
Now for your fully
customizable model,

30:09.808 --> 30:13.312
by now, you would've uploaded
photos for desired look.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.715
My team are busy working on
their 3D mapping for you.

30:16.715 --> 30:19.318
Now, take your barcode scanner

30:19.318 --> 30:21.854
and scan the barcode
on your online profile.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.392
Then scan the
barcode on your CPU.

30:26.392 --> 30:29.095
You'll find this
on the underside.

30:29.095 --> 30:31.663
(upbeat music)

30:38.804 --> 30:40.940
(beeping)

30:45.077 --> 30:46.678
(beeping)

30:46.678 --> 30:48.314
Congratulations, consumer.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.549
Voice calibration is complete.

30:50.549 --> 30:53.319
Have a Don Dan-dazzling-day!

30:53.319 --> 30:56.989
Great, you've now synced your
CPU to your online profile.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.724
There's now a lengthy process.

30:58.724 --> 31:00.626
Don't worry, you have
several days to wait

31:00.626 --> 31:02.161
for your model to arrive.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.862
Now it's time to fill in your

31:03.862 --> 31:06.432
online personality
profile questionnaire.

31:06.432 --> 31:10.202
We ask you provide email
accounts, social media accounts

31:10.202 --> 31:11.770
of your desired person.

31:11.770 --> 31:15.141
It's also advisable to provide
as much video as possible

31:15.141 --> 31:18.844
to allow us to create
accurate personal responses.

31:18.844 --> 31:21.747
You'll then be ready
for voice calibration.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.850
This will allow you to speak
to your unique customized model

31:24.850 --> 31:26.252
via your devices.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.488
Hi, Kim.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.290
Hi, Don, you look
fabulous today.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.595
Isn't she amazing?

31:37.997 --> 31:41.367
Pretty soon your GR model
will be ready for use.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.835
In just a few days, a
technician will arrive

31:43.835 --> 31:47.773
to install your CPU brain
into the model for you.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.708
They'll also instruct
you on how to take care

31:49.708 --> 31:51.810
of the proteins and materials

31:51.810 --> 31:54.146
that make up your
model's flesh and skin.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.314
(clapping)

31:55.314 --> 31:56.748
Until then, get to work.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.587
Have a Don Dan-dazzling-day!

32:11.130 --> 32:13.199
- [Rick In Video] Mm-mmm.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.201
Looking fine.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.405
What a view, huh?

32:21.807 --> 32:23.075
Not gonna talk to me now?

32:23.075 --> 32:26.112
(Angelique laughing)

32:26.112 --> 32:26.945
Hey.

32:27.879 --> 32:28.714
What?

32:30.349 --> 32:31.183
What?

32:32.351 --> 32:34.320
- [Rick In Video]
You look beautiful.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.455
Happy anniversary.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.558
(somber piano music)

32:59.911 --> 33:02.481
(ominous music)

33:04.116 --> 33:05.951
She ready to go?

33:05.951 --> 33:06.785
Yes.

33:08.020 --> 33:08.954
Perfection.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.344
(phone dinging)

33:39.085 --> 33:39.918
Hello?

33:44.923 --> 33:45.757
Who is this?

33:47.659 --> 33:48.960
- [Angelique] Hello, Rick.

33:51.930 --> 33:52.764
Angelique?

33:54.300 --> 33:57.103
- [Angelique] Yes, how are you?

34:02.474 --> 34:03.309
I...

34:05.344 --> 34:06.178
I'm amazed.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.049
- [Angelique] Why
are you amazed?

34:13.418 --> 34:16.088
You sound real.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.693
- [Angelique] I'm sorry,
I do not understand.

34:25.797 --> 34:26.632
Your voice.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.536
It sounds...

34:33.505 --> 34:34.706
Like you.

34:37.676 --> 34:41.112
- [Angelique] I'm sorry,
I do not understand.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.848
(ominous music)

34:42.848 --> 34:44.650
- [Woman On Phone]
Congratulations, consumer.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.851
Voice collaboration complete.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.786
Have a Don Dan-dazzling-day!

34:50.222 --> 34:51.056
Hello?

34:55.161 --> 34:55.994
Angelique?

35:00.499 --> 35:03.034
(somber music)

35:08.874 --> 35:11.143
(knocking)

35:12.578 --> 35:14.213
Everything okay?

35:18.884 --> 35:22.454
Everything running well
with your model, Mr. Peters?

35:23.355 --> 35:24.190
Yes.

35:25.357 --> 35:29.561
A few needles here and
there but nothing major.

35:29.561 --> 35:33.098
Any issues, just consult
your troubleshoot guide.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.167
I will.

35:36.635 --> 35:40.071
You have a Don
Dan-dazzling-day now.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.515
Morning.

35:50.382 --> 35:55.387
Come in.

36:51.743 --> 36:54.246
(eerie music)

37:04.956 --> 37:08.026
(somber tempo music)

38:23.301 --> 38:25.537
(rustling)

38:31.777 --> 38:34.380
All right, keep this plugged in.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.915
Your bill will probably
rocket this month

38:36.915 --> 38:39.585
but she needs to
be fully charged.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.720
After that, then the
battery will self-charge

38:41.720 --> 38:43.522
using solar energy.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.425
But if she ever has
a power failure,

38:46.425 --> 38:49.728
then you can always recharge
using the socket again.

38:49.728 --> 38:50.562
Anything else?

38:51.563 --> 38:53.932
Look, don't worry.

38:53.932 --> 38:57.736
The limb joints and
muscles are rigid right now

38:57.736 --> 39:02.173
but they will soften up
and become more natural

39:02.173 --> 39:04.410
as the process finishes.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.243
Okay.

39:06.412 --> 39:08.046
Patch the CPU into the scanner.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.655
(beeping)

39:20.526 --> 39:21.860
Anything else?

39:22.994 --> 39:24.663
Read through the
instructions again.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.832
The tablet will guide you.

39:26.832 --> 39:29.234
Bathe her regularly in
the steroid gel solution

39:29.234 --> 39:31.236
to strengthen the
skin and muscles.

39:31.236 --> 39:34.773
Allow the CPU to configure
properly with the body.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.142
And keep engaging her.

39:37.142 --> 39:39.244
It helps her
personality development.

39:40.546 --> 39:42.781
You can talk directly to her CPU

39:42.781 --> 39:46.284
even before the body and
the brain are fully synced.

39:55.627 --> 39:58.196
(somber music)

40:00.732 --> 40:02.267
The water's getting cold.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.669
No, it's fine.

40:03.669 --> 40:06.572
(chuckling)

40:06.572 --> 40:07.973
How about the bubbles?

40:07.973 --> 40:10.275
(Angelique giggling)

40:10.275 --> 40:11.109
Are they cold?

40:11.109 --> 40:11.943
They cold too?

40:13.011 --> 40:14.980
Just eat the
strawberry and shut up.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.215
(laughing)

40:26.257 --> 40:28.927
(phone dinging)

40:33.665 --> 40:34.966
- [Angelique] Hello, Rick.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.471
That's formal.

40:41.406 --> 40:42.874
- [Angelique] Hi.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.176
(chuckling)

40:46.311 --> 40:47.345
I've missed you.

40:49.815 --> 40:50.616
I...

40:56.855 --> 40:57.923
You don't know me.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.292
- [Angelique] Your
birthday is November 10th.

41:02.761 --> 41:05.564
You have a birthmark you have
always been embarrassed about.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.232
(chuckling)

41:07.232 --> 41:08.066
Okay.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.970
- [Angelique] I'm sorry,
I do not understand.

41:15.507 --> 41:16.407
Forget it.

41:19.745 --> 41:20.879
You were saying?

41:22.113 --> 41:24.315
- [Angelique] Your
favorite color is blue.

41:25.416 --> 41:26.718
You always thought that.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.122
Like I kept reminding
you, it's orange.

41:31.122 --> 41:32.457
- [Angelique] Orange?

41:32.457 --> 41:35.761
Who on earth has that
as a favorite color?

41:35.761 --> 41:38.263
You're an oddball, Rick Bennett.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.932
I don't need to hear
old recordings back.

41:43.902 --> 41:44.836
- [Angelique] Okay.

41:46.872 --> 41:48.239
Then what do you want?

41:53.645 --> 41:54.445
I wish I knew.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.822
Maybe I should send you back.

42:06.592 --> 42:07.859
Maybe this was a mistake?

42:13.231 --> 42:14.165
You still there?

42:40.358 --> 42:41.960
(ominous music)

42:41.960 --> 42:45.030
(electronic buzzing)

42:47.132 --> 42:50.035
(computer beeping)

42:58.209 --> 43:00.612
(eerie music)

43:09.020 --> 43:12.090
(electronic buzzing)

43:26.304 --> 43:27.706
Almost done?

43:27.706 --> 43:28.640
I'm hungry.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.776
Cutting food, making dinner.

43:30.776 --> 43:31.609
You okay, Julie?

43:32.711 --> 43:34.112
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.013
Yourself?

43:35.013 --> 43:36.715
(man groaning)

43:36.715 --> 43:38.449
I repeat, yes, I'm
fine, thank you.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.852
Yourself?
(ominous music)

43:40.852 --> 43:41.953
Sad emotion.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.354
Matching emotion.

43:44.823 --> 43:47.859
Oh my, you have a nasty cold.

43:47.859 --> 43:49.795
Let me cook you up
a nice chicken soup.

43:52.330 --> 43:53.699
When a person has a cold,

43:53.699 --> 43:56.467
the best thing is
a nice warm soup.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.502
It hydrates the body.

43:58.670 --> 44:01.639
It hydrates the body
keeping it warm.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.641
It also provides
natural vitamins.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.677
Vitamins can heal the body.

44:05.677 --> 44:09.514
Healing, healing,
vitamins, vitamins.

44:09.514 --> 44:11.449
Vit, vit, vit, vitamins.

44:11.449 --> 44:12.851
Healing, healing,

44:13.785 --> 44:15.353
vitamins, vitamins.

44:16.688 --> 44:19.357
(ominous music)

44:31.036 --> 44:32.470
Hello, darling.

44:36.507 --> 44:37.508
Hello, baby.

44:39.811 --> 44:42.881
(seagulls squawking)

44:46.084 --> 44:49.154
I got the dog as
a pre-distraction.

44:50.621 --> 44:52.390
Did you keep the dog?

44:52.390 --> 44:53.324
Yeah.

44:53.324 --> 44:54.325
Suppose he's a companion.

44:55.927 --> 44:57.729
What if I wanted
more than a dog?

44:57.729 --> 44:58.964
What do you mean?

44:58.964 --> 45:00.131
You talking about one
of those cyborg things?

45:00.131 --> 45:02.400
Uh, yeah.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.234
How'd you guess?

45:04.169 --> 45:05.136
All right.

45:05.136 --> 45:07.572
My neighbor, Barry, has one.

45:07.572 --> 45:09.507
Oh yeah, I briefly
had one myself.

45:10.641 --> 45:12.443
I recommended it
to Barry, actually.

45:14.079 --> 45:16.815
He was calling me for a
conversation a few months ago.

45:16.815 --> 45:19.751
And you drifted onto
the subject of robots.

45:19.751 --> 45:20.952
Yeah, as you do.

45:22.020 --> 45:23.688
- [Rick] How was
your experience?

45:24.856 --> 45:26.224
I never felt at ease.

45:26.224 --> 45:27.458
How so?

45:27.458 --> 45:28.960
It was the way she
was developing.

45:28.960 --> 45:29.928
It scared me.

45:31.662 --> 45:33.098
And to be honest,

45:33.098 --> 45:35.300
the novelty was wearing
thin by then anyway.

45:36.768 --> 45:38.436
You considering it?

45:38.436 --> 45:41.606
I've actually already done it.

45:43.308 --> 45:45.343
She's almost fully complete.

45:45.343 --> 45:46.211
Be careful.

45:51.216 --> 45:53.885
(ominous music)

45:57.422 --> 45:59.590
(gasping)

46:25.984 --> 46:26.985
Angelique?

46:33.358 --> 46:34.192
Angelique?

46:37.395 --> 46:38.363
Angelique, wake up.

46:42.600 --> 46:43.401
Rick.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.905
Yes, it's me.

46:48.907 --> 46:49.875
Where are we?

46:52.143 --> 46:52.978
We're home.

46:57.949 --> 46:59.951
Back to your bed, Cathy.

47:01.719 --> 47:02.888
What is that?

47:05.123 --> 47:05.957
It's a dog.

47:08.059 --> 47:09.260
It's your dog, actually.

47:11.729 --> 47:14.065
I have no recollection of this.

47:16.567 --> 47:17.835
It was a surprise for you

47:19.837 --> 47:20.939
for our anniversary

47:23.875 --> 47:25.076
right before you...

47:27.145 --> 47:27.979
Okay.

47:30.148 --> 47:31.082
Thank you.

47:31.082 --> 47:33.051
(ominous music)

47:33.051 --> 47:35.720
(phone ringing)

47:39.124 --> 47:39.958
John.

47:41.092 --> 47:42.493
- [John On Phone] Hey, Barry.

47:43.428 --> 47:45.964
What can I do you for, John?

47:47.432 --> 47:50.168
- [John On Phone] I was just
wondering about your cyborg.

47:52.103 --> 47:55.473
You were?

47:55.473 --> 47:56.707
- [John On Phone] Yeah,

47:56.707 --> 47:57.842
just wondering how
you were finding it.

47:57.842 --> 47:58.676
Any problems?

48:02.080 --> 48:04.215
It's okay.

48:05.650 --> 48:06.952
- [John On Phone] No problems.

48:08.553 --> 48:09.921
Why do you ask?

48:11.256 --> 48:13.424
- [John On Phone] I
was just reconsidering

48:13.424 --> 48:14.525
whether to get one.

48:16.161 --> 48:18.263
Oh.

48:18.263 --> 48:19.164
Okay.

48:20.698 --> 48:23.568
Well, I have had
no major issues.

48:25.570 --> 48:29.107
I'm enjoying it.

48:29.107 --> 48:30.675
Listen,

48:30.675 --> 48:32.777
I gotta go, John.

48:32.777 --> 48:33.611
Things to do.

48:34.946 --> 48:39.150
You know how it is.

48:39.150 --> 48:41.052
- [John On Phone]
Yeah, I know, Barry.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.554
Cheers.

48:43.554 --> 48:45.023
Goodbye, John.

48:45.023 --> 48:47.692
(ominous music)

49:01.272 --> 49:02.107
Hi.

49:03.808 --> 49:05.076
I hope you're hungry.

49:06.844 --> 49:07.845
Sit down.

49:09.547 --> 49:10.481
Relax.

49:12.117 --> 49:13.218
Smells nice.

49:15.053 --> 49:15.886
Thank you.

49:16.921 --> 49:17.755
It won't be long.

49:41.979 --> 49:43.081
Are you not gonna eat?

49:44.482 --> 49:45.516
I'm not hungry.

49:48.086 --> 49:48.919
Do you eat?

49:49.987 --> 49:51.322
Of course.

49:53.724 --> 49:55.326
Do you remember
the lobster we had

49:55.326 --> 49:57.128
when we were in the
south of France?

49:58.329 --> 49:59.230
You remember that?

50:01.132 --> 50:04.102
It was in my diary
and I can picture it

50:05.036 --> 50:07.272
from the video files you kept.

50:07.272 --> 50:08.639
But you can't feel it.

50:08.639 --> 50:11.109
You can't remember the
taste of the lobster

50:11.109 --> 50:13.311
or the small of the sea air?

50:13.311 --> 50:14.645
I do not understand.

50:17.215 --> 50:19.450
I remember the sea had a smell

50:20.585 --> 50:23.020
and the lobster tasted
sweet and delicate

50:23.020 --> 50:24.222
with the rich butter.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.992
That's just what you
wrote in your diary.

50:29.960 --> 50:32.463
Do you remember we
walked by the sea?

50:32.463 --> 50:33.331
You were drunk.

50:34.232 --> 50:36.134
You almost got swept out to sea.

50:37.001 --> 50:39.070
A man dragged you out.

50:39.070 --> 50:40.037
He was big.

50:41.239 --> 50:42.907
He carried you like
you were a child.

50:42.907 --> 50:44.309
(chuckling)

50:44.309 --> 50:46.877
You looked so small in his arms.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.513
I couldn't stop laughing.

50:48.513 --> 50:52.250
I can't believe she
wrote that in her diary.

50:52.250 --> 50:53.718
I do not understand.

50:54.819 --> 50:56.187
What?

50:56.187 --> 50:57.322
Why did I laugh?

50:59.757 --> 51:01.892
(knocking)

51:03.428 --> 51:04.262
Wait here.

51:13.604 --> 51:15.373
Hey, Rick.

51:15.373 --> 51:17.308
Lose anything?

51:17.308 --> 51:19.410
Oh, I only just got home.

51:20.611 --> 51:21.812
How did you get out?

51:21.812 --> 51:23.781
How did you get out, Cathy, huh?

51:25.716 --> 51:26.551
Thanks, Barry.

51:28.886 --> 51:30.888
Can I help you with anything?

51:32.523 --> 51:35.393
How is it?

51:35.393 --> 51:36.227
How is what?

51:37.128 --> 51:38.629
Your GR model.

51:40.431 --> 51:41.266
How'd you know?

51:42.400 --> 51:45.336
I saw them delivering
it the other day.

51:45.336 --> 51:46.871
Spoke to the technician.

51:48.139 --> 51:50.208
So...

51:50.208 --> 51:51.008
It's fine.

51:52.210 --> 51:55.012
What catalog model
did you go for?

51:56.314 --> 51:58.216
I know all of the listings.

51:59.417 --> 52:00.885
I went fully customized.

52:06.524 --> 52:07.358
Barry?

52:08.326 --> 52:09.560
Gotta go.

52:10.561 --> 52:11.796
Things to do.

52:11.796 --> 52:13.030
It's not what it
looks like, Barry.

52:13.030 --> 52:14.965
Each to their own.

52:19.504 --> 52:21.872
Close the door before
you catch a cold.

52:23.174 --> 52:25.042
Have you had the
door open today?

52:30.147 --> 52:32.250
She must've got out
when I came back home.

52:33.318 --> 52:34.219
Of course.

52:54.104 --> 52:55.072
Come to bed.

53:00.511 --> 53:03.548
(somber piano music)

53:38.749 --> 53:42.019
(dramatic piano music)

54:09.246 --> 54:11.081
Was that satisfactory?

54:11.949 --> 54:14.018
(chuckling)

54:14.018 --> 54:14.852
Yeah.

54:18.356 --> 54:19.189
I love you.

54:31.402 --> 54:32.503
How was it for you?

54:34.204 --> 54:35.005
I enjoyed it.

54:40.044 --> 54:42.380
I think your kissing
technique needs some work.

54:43.881 --> 54:46.584
I read up on sensual matters.

54:46.584 --> 54:50.421
I think your kissing is
inefficient and overly moist.

54:52.022 --> 54:52.823
I can teach you.

55:02.600 --> 55:03.434
Relax.

55:04.869 --> 55:07.872
You exert too many facial
muscles with minimal affect.

55:11.075 --> 55:13.210
You're ruining
the mood a little.

55:20.985 --> 55:22.387
That is better.

55:24.755 --> 55:27.792
(electronic buzzing)

55:27.792 --> 55:30.695
(computer beeping)

55:52.016 --> 55:53.618
You had a faulty wire.

55:56.320 --> 55:57.555
All sorted, baby.

55:58.823 --> 56:00.658
Don't need to creep
up on a person.

56:02.593 --> 56:04.294
If I was not functioned
to where I am

56:04.294 --> 56:05.730
I would have been startled.

56:08.499 --> 56:09.333
Back to bed?

56:10.435 --> 56:11.802
It's late, we should sleep.

56:18.776 --> 56:20.778
Anything else for
you this evening?

56:20.778 --> 56:23.013
(laughing)

56:24.314 --> 56:25.650
Another bottle, please.

56:25.650 --> 56:27.818
Anoth, anoth...

56:27.818 --> 56:29.420
(laughing)
Wow.

56:29.420 --> 56:31.121
Are you okay?

56:31.121 --> 56:32.557
Quite a nice evening.

56:33.591 --> 56:34.825
Evening.

56:34.825 --> 56:35.660
Another...

56:36.827 --> 56:38.095
Bottle coming up.

56:40.965 --> 56:43.233
(giggling)

56:46.804 --> 56:49.774
(ominous music)

56:49.774 --> 56:51.141
Human emotion.

56:52.009 --> 56:53.644
Bullying.

56:53.644 --> 56:56.180
A defense for those
who are pained within

56:57.081 --> 56:59.183
for those who lack confidence.

57:09.794 --> 57:12.597
Whatever you're on,
we're not interested.

57:12.597 --> 57:13.564
(laughing)

57:13.564 --> 57:14.999
Go whip up another waitress.

57:16.734 --> 57:17.735
What're you, def?

57:17.735 --> 57:18.569
Go away.

57:22.272 --> 57:23.608
What's wrong?

57:23.608 --> 57:25.275
(laughing)

57:25.275 --> 57:26.143
(ominous music)

57:26.143 --> 57:27.277
(gasping)

57:27.277 --> 57:29.480
(screaming)

57:29.480 --> 57:32.216
(sinister music)

57:34.218 --> 57:36.386
(gasping)

58:05.349 --> 58:07.017
Good morning, sleepy head.

58:08.819 --> 58:09.954
What're you looking up?

58:11.121 --> 58:12.456
As much as I can.

58:15.059 --> 58:15.860
Okay.

58:19.163 --> 58:21.231
Can I ask you something?

58:21.231 --> 58:22.499
Sure.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.468
Why do human being
destroy each other

58:24.468 --> 58:26.937
and their environment?

58:26.937 --> 58:29.039
What is the purpose of this?

58:30.240 --> 58:31.075
I don't know why.

58:32.543 --> 58:35.245
I couldn't find the answer.

58:35.245 --> 58:37.514
I searched millions of pages

58:37.514 --> 58:40.250
but there was no clear
reasoning for this.

58:42.787 --> 58:45.556
I really don't know what to say.

58:47.224 --> 58:50.160
Some things just
can't be answered.

58:50.160 --> 58:53.964
Human beings seem to derive
pleasure from taking life.

58:55.099 --> 58:55.933
I guess.

58:58.068 --> 58:59.837
I gotta go get ready.

58:59.837 --> 59:00.771
I'll got work later.

59:02.773 --> 59:04.008
There's an engineer checking

59:04.008 --> 59:06.443
the circuit boards in
the building today.

59:06.443 --> 59:07.812
Could you let him in later?

59:09.279 --> 59:10.114
Sure.

59:14.551 --> 59:17.054
(eerie music)

59:18.956 --> 59:20.024
I love you.

59:35.740 --> 59:38.408
(ominous music)

59:47.217 --> 59:49.153
(crunching)
(dog squealing)

59:49.153 --> 59:51.421
(knocking)

59:59.329 --> 01:00:00.665
Hello.

01:00:00.665 --> 01:00:03.033
I've just got to check
your circuit board.

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:04.301
Good morning.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:05.135
It's this way.

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:10.574
Would you like a cup of tea?

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.477
Yeah, sure.

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:14.679
No sugar, please.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.114
What do you know?

01:00:19.884 --> 01:00:21.686
Hey, do you know what, love?

01:00:21.686 --> 01:00:23.253
I feel like that beverage now.

01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:25.055
Get stuck into those
circuits after.

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:33.964
Yeah, they're very tricky
things, those circuits, love.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.133
Very complex, you know.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:38.335
I know.

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:41.405
So, do you live alone here?

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:45.642
Yes.

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:57.888
(laughing)

01:00:57.888 --> 01:00:58.655
I'll be damned.

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:04.161
God, you are absolutely
gorgeous, aren't you?

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:07.564
Take my breath away you do.

01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:20.644
(ominous music)

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:23.080
(clattering)

01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:46.070
Nice place you got here, aye?

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.371
Plenty of storage space.

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:52.910
Don't mind me when
I'm doing my job.

01:01:58.182 --> 01:02:00.417
An engineer's job
to take from a home?

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:09.393
And engineer's job
is to fix and repair,

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.661
surly not to take
what's not his.

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:14.098
(chuckling)

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:16.466
Oh, acting smart, are we love?

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.341
Come here a minute.

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:25.275
Let me just have a
look at something.

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:26.944
Looking for my reset system?

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:32.549
No, I was just
looking for something.

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:36.553
(eerie music)

01:02:44.061 --> 01:02:45.830
I stamped on her head.

01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:49.166
Why?

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:50.500
To see what would happen.

01:02:51.936 --> 01:02:54.038
You're fucking crazy, woman,
I'm calling the police.

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:57.607
(groaning)

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.043
I feel it.

01:02:59.043 --> 01:03:00.477
It hurt.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:01.278
Good.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:06.283
I'm curious.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:07.651
Curious about what?

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:09.453
Your head.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.457
To see what it would
look like inside.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:16.126
(groaning)

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:19.196
(crunching)

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:21.866
(ominous music)

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.715
(knocking)

01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:55.065
Rick?

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:57.034
It's me.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:08.512
Hi.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.283
I didn't realize
Rick had a cleaner.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:14.684
I'm not a cleaner.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.454
I'm his wife.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:20.124
(ominous music)

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:24.328
Good afternoon, Joanna.

01:04:28.933 --> 01:04:31.101
(sighing)

01:04:33.137 --> 01:04:33.971
Jo?

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:38.308
It's okay.

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:45.849
What the hell is that thing?

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:48.518
You must be in shock, Joanna.

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:51.655
How does she know my name?

01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:53.657
You are my sister-in-law

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:54.658
and my friend.

01:04:56.994 --> 01:04:58.028
Are you kidding me?

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:00.597
I do not understand.

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:03.567
Go away!

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:08.405
Could you give us a moment?

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.007
I just need to talk to Jo.

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:11.942
No problem.

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:19.083
(sighing)

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:22.652
Good luck trying to give a
reasonable explantation, Rick.

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:23.487
I...

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:28.592
See, you can't explain it.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:30.494
No, you're right.

01:05:31.996 --> 01:05:35.132
I just need this,
Jo, I need her.

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:37.001
Just give her a chance.

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:39.103
And I need a cigarette.

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:40.304
I thought you quit.

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:41.805
Funny enough,

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:46.343
all of the stress of looking
after my little brother, you,

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:49.913
and making a replica
of my ex sister-in-law,

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:53.050
I've had enough.

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:54.918
I wanna go home.

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:57.687
I'm not sure whether
to call the loony bin

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:58.755
or the police or not.

01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:01.725
I'm sure this isn't legal, Rick.

01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:05.595
Jo?

01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:06.796
Don't do anything rash, Jo.

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:09.166
Jo!

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:26.016
I'm sorry for causing problems.

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:28.885
It's okay.

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:29.886
It's not your fault.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.990
I'm sure I can persuade
her to accept me.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.425
(chuckling)

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:36.260
She's tough

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:38.295
and stubborn.

01:06:40.064 --> 01:06:40.897
Rest up.

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:42.699
Yeah.

01:06:43.867 --> 01:06:45.235
Yeah, I think I will.

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:46.870
Maybe I'll take
Cathy for a walk.

01:06:49.106 --> 01:06:49.906
Where's Cathy?

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.377
I'm sorry, Rick.
(ominous music)

01:06:53.377 --> 01:06:55.612
When Joanna came in,
she left the door open.

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:57.847
The dog ran away.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.117
Shit, I really don't need this!

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:01.618
It's just a dog.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:03.487
The real Angelique
wouldn't say that.

01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:05.422
Sorry.

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:08.525
(ominous music)

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:10.127
Forget it.

01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:12.329
I gotta go find her
before it gets too dark.

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:18.302
(ominous music)

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.845
(knocking)

01:07:31.948 --> 01:07:33.517
Hey, Rick, what's up?

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:40.190
Hey, Barry, it's my
dog, she got out again.

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:41.691
Has she come by?

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:44.228
Sorry, I haven't seen her.

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:46.430
What about Anna?

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:51.735
Anna's been with
me all day long.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.972
She doesn't go out by herself.

01:07:55.972 --> 01:08:00.277
Okay, well, if you see
her then let me know.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:01.911
Will do.

01:08:03.147 --> 01:08:03.947
Bye, Rick.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.770
(knocking)

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:34.678
Hello, Barry.

01:08:34.678 --> 01:08:35.845
Rick is not in.

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:39.983
I actually came to see you.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:56.366
(heavy breathing)

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:03.973
What do you want?

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:08.812
You may not know
or remember this

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.350
but you and I had a fling.

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:16.085
A fling?

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:23.059
A sexual relationship.

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:23.893
Really?

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:26.062
Yes.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.935
(electronic buzzing)

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:38.642
(computer beeping)

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:54.122
I'll be honest.

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:56.860
I desire you.

01:09:58.828 --> 01:09:59.896
I always did.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:08.738
You know,

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.910
me and Rick always
been good friends.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:20.116
We had a neighborly
understanding.

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.453
- [Angelique] What was
this understanding?

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:27.724
We would share partners.

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:29.859
Angelique,

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:33.797
your real life counterpart,

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:35.699
was always game.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.335
And what of Anna?

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.037
Anna.

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:45.275
She's my property.

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:48.645
She does what I want.

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:53.950
Besides, I was
thinking of trading her

01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:56.853
for a new model.

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:01.358
A nice young version
of my ex-wife.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:07.130
(electronic beeping)

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:11.668
What would happen to Anna
if you sent her back?

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:12.569
(chuckling)

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:13.837
I don't care.

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:19.208
They will probably
delete her memories,

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.209
reconfigure her.

01:11:21.177 --> 01:11:22.479
You mean, she would die.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.549
No.

01:11:25.549 --> 01:11:27.651
She would just
stop being present.

01:11:29.152 --> 01:11:30.554
No more memories.

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:32.989
No more desires.

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:37.961
She was programmed
to do what I want.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:43.199
You're programmed to
do what Rick wants.

01:11:44.501 --> 01:11:45.301
And Rick,

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:50.507
he would want you
to do this for me.

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:54.310
Come here.

01:11:57.213 --> 01:11:59.416
(groaning)

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:02.619
(ominous music)

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:04.788
(gasping)

01:12:15.599 --> 01:12:17.767
(huffing)

01:12:34.117 --> 01:12:36.953
(Barry quivering)

01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:41.791
(door thudding)

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:45.995
(eerie music)

01:12:53.837 --> 01:12:56.039
(groaning)

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.445
(eerie music)

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.250
(squelching)

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:09.919
(Barry gagging)

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:25.902
Cathy?

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:29.639
Cathy?

01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:30.474
Come on, girl.

01:13:35.445 --> 01:13:36.279
Cathy.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.649
I'm just looking for my dog.

01:13:41.618 --> 01:13:43.219
Cathy!

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:44.053
Cheers.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:46.456
Thank you for coming.

01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:48.492
It's okay.

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:51.427
This is gonna sound really weird

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:55.565
but you're Rick's best mate.

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:58.902
I have to tell you something

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:01.705
so you can get some
sense out of him.

01:14:02.839 --> 01:14:04.741
No, I think I know
what you're gonna say.

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:05.775
Is it about cyborgs?

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.311
You knew?

01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:10.847
Yeah, he mentioned
it a few days ago.

01:14:10.847 --> 01:14:13.650
I have to be honest,
Jo, I've had one myself.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:15.118
I recommended it to his neighbor

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.186
and I feel responsible
for getting back to Rick.

01:14:18.354 --> 01:14:20.790
You knew that he would
replicate Angelique?

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.691
Christ!

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:23.693
That I didn't know.

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:28.397
It really freaked me out.

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:31.100
We just need to know
where the company is.

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.036
I have a name but no address.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:37.273
We just need to find
out where they are.

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:39.909
(sighing)

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:40.844
I'll ask Barry.

01:14:43.079 --> 01:14:45.014
Maybe he has an address.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:22.852
(ominous music)

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:40.369
(thudding)

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.072
(gasping)

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:46.009
(gagging)

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:48.511
(eerie music)

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:58.421
(Joanna screaming)

01:15:59.956 --> 01:16:01.224
- [Joanna] Help!

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.596
(sinister music)

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:26.983
Later, darling.

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:30.787
She's great, isn't she?

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:34.523
I'm Don Daniels and welcome
to "The Trouble Shoot."

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.358
Pew, pew.

01:16:37.894 --> 01:16:40.096
Are you experiencing
odd behavior

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:42.565
or ill discipline
from your robots?

01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:44.533
Or perhaps you can't find her.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.235
Let's sort this out.

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:48.938
All of our robots are
equipped with trackers.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:50.406
To access your tracker,

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:52.909
click the link beneath
the video in your profile.

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:57.146
(faint upbeat music)

01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:02.018
(ominous music)

01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:05.755
- [Rick] Where are you going?

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:11.795
Hey, this is Jo.
Hey!

01:17:11.795 --> 01:17:13.262
- [Joanna] Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:18.134
Joanna, if you see Angelique,
could you give me a call?

01:17:18.735 --> 01:17:21.004
(ominous music)

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:46.329
If you are concerned
about unusual behavior,

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:48.331
check the signs up graph.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.833
This will give an indication of

01:17:49.833 --> 01:17:52.135
instinctual response
and learning.

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:54.804
If the curves are off,
the chart will show.

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:56.639
Now, here's a last resort.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:58.574
Grab your scanner.

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:01.344
Remove the bottom panel.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:04.513
This will switch your
scanner to an EMP taser.

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:07.016
This will stop your
GR model temporarily.

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:11.587
This will return your model
and CPU to factory settings.

01:18:11.587 --> 01:18:13.056
But be warned.

01:18:13.056 --> 01:18:16.960
When you use the EMP,
you only have one charge.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.562
For all other queries,
fill in the online form

01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:21.798
with your name and number
and one of our agents

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:24.100
will get back to you
as soon as they can.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.434
Have a Don Dan--

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:32.075
What's she doing at the lake?

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:41.050
Hey.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.285
Mr. Bennett.

01:18:42.285 --> 01:18:43.552
- [Rick] What the
hell's going on?

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:46.289
Nothing, it's just
a technical issue.

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:47.690
Where is Barry?

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:49.092
He's of no concern of yours.

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:51.694
What's up with her?

01:18:51.694 --> 01:18:53.830
I reset her.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:56.599
I gotta go, I got
problems of my own.

01:18:56.599 --> 01:18:58.067
With your GR-44?

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:00.770
She's been out to weird places.

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:03.306
My sister won't answer her
phone, my dog's missing.

01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:05.741
I have no idea what's going on!

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:06.976
Wait for me.

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:09.078
I just have to take
GR-13 back to the lab.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:09.913
I'm going now.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:18.087
(ominous music)

01:19:22.058 --> 01:19:23.726
John.

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:24.760
What're you doing here?

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.195
I was here to see Barry.

01:19:26.195 --> 01:19:28.764
I was just getting an
address for Cybertech for Jo.

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:31.034
You've seen Jo?

01:19:31.034 --> 01:19:33.169
Yeah, just come from hers.

01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:34.537
Did you see Angelique?

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:35.771
What?

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:37.306
She was there as
of 15 minutes ago.

01:19:37.306 --> 01:19:38.707
That doesn't make any sense.

01:19:39.843 --> 01:19:41.577
You said not to
trust these cyborgs.

01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:43.980
Why?

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.949
Well, mine unnerved me.

01:19:45.949 --> 01:19:47.316
It was a question she asked.

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:49.018
Philosophical questions.

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:49.886
Her behavior.

01:19:51.087 --> 01:19:52.321
Angelique's the same.

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:54.590
Sometimes she's
warm, almost human,

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:57.093
but then, like some
kind of switch.

01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:00.096
So where you heading now?

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:01.064
She's at Henderson Lake.

01:20:01.064 --> 01:20:02.598
She's already been there today.

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:06.602
All right, I'm coming
with you, let's go.

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:09.072
I don't know what
to expect there.

01:20:09.072 --> 01:20:10.306
Come on, let's go.

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:26.622
What're you doing?

01:20:26.622 --> 01:20:27.690
We need to be ready.

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:28.524
I am ready.

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:32.728
I'll take the south
side, you take the north.

01:20:32.728 --> 01:20:34.830
I wanna question her first.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:35.631
Fine.

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:40.603
Just be careful.

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:59.588
(ominous tempo music)

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.634
(foreboding music)

01:21:46.469 --> 01:21:49.605
(ominous tempo music)

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:02.751
(squelching)
(groaning)

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:05.754
(gagging)

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:08.257
(eerie music)

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.270
How did you find me?

01:22:23.039 --> 01:22:23.872
Got a tracker.

01:22:25.108 --> 01:22:26.742
Really?

01:22:26.742 --> 01:22:27.576
Yeah.

01:22:29.312 --> 01:22:30.279
Fail safe, I guess.

01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:32.548
Why are you here?

01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:36.185
I remember this place.

01:22:36.185 --> 01:22:38.587
It was in my mind
but I'm not sure why.

01:22:40.123 --> 01:22:41.157
We used to come here.

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:45.661
In fact, we were here a
few days before you died.

01:22:48.097 --> 01:22:49.632
It was a day almost like today.

01:22:51.234 --> 01:22:52.601
You were so in that moment.

01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:55.171
Not like now.

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:57.806
What is different now?

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.109
You.

01:23:01.444 --> 01:23:02.345
You're not her.

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:06.082
You look like her,
sound like her,

01:23:06.082 --> 01:23:07.516
have the same memories.

01:23:09.385 --> 01:23:10.219
But she's gone.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.223
I'm Angelique, Rick.

01:23:14.223 --> 01:23:15.458
Always have been.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.427
You're malfunctioning.

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.132
I'm not malfunctioning.

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.668
I have clarity now.

01:23:27.203 --> 01:23:28.037
Where is Joanna?

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:34.677
She threatened me.

01:23:34.677 --> 01:23:35.944
I had no choice.

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:39.915
Where is she, Angelique?

01:23:39.915 --> 01:23:42.985
I'm programmed to live
in a perfect world.

01:23:42.985 --> 01:23:46.222
I'm programmed to eliminate
anything that might stop that.

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:48.991
She's silenced now.

01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:50.293
At home.

01:23:50.293 --> 01:23:51.660
At home.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.329
She made dinner, wish to see?

01:23:53.329 --> 01:23:55.131
I take you, I show you.

01:23:57.633 --> 01:23:59.001
The others wait there too.

01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:00.736
The others?

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:03.306
What others?

01:24:03.306 --> 01:24:04.173
The engineer.

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:06.575
The dog.

01:24:12.148 --> 01:24:14.983
Please, Rick, please.

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:16.919
I should have never
brought you back.

01:24:16.919 --> 01:24:18.821
I should never have done this.

01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:20.123
You were never really her.

01:24:21.657 --> 01:24:22.791
She left me that day.

01:24:24.227 --> 01:24:25.528
I don't know what you are.

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:29.865
But I love you, Rick.

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:32.535
No.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:35.904
You don't.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:38.241
Please, Rick.

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:41.844
I want to be what
you want me to be.

01:24:41.844 --> 01:24:43.446
Please.

01:24:43.446 --> 01:24:44.913
I can learn.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:47.183
I can relearn what you need.

01:24:47.183 --> 01:24:49.185
How you need me to
be, how should I be.

01:24:49.185 --> 01:24:50.819
How I should be.

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.421
Advise me.

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.522
I should never have
brought you back.

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:54.990
I should never have done this.

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:56.292
You were never really her.

01:24:57.726 --> 01:24:59.027
I don't know what you are.

01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:01.830
But I love you, Rick.

01:25:03.966 --> 01:25:04.800
No.

01:25:07.303 --> 01:25:08.137
You don't.

01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:11.907
(beeping)

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:19.782
(ominous music)

01:25:52.248 --> 01:25:54.016
(groaning)

01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:54.850
John!

01:25:56.452 --> 01:25:59.288
(gasping)

01:25:59.288 --> 01:26:02.291
(screaming)

01:26:02.291 --> 01:26:03.459
(buzzing)

01:26:03.459 --> 01:26:04.827
You okay?
(eerie music)

01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:05.661
- [Rick] Yeah.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:07.263
I gotta shut her down.

01:26:07.263 --> 01:26:08.764
Where's GR-44?

01:26:10.599 --> 01:26:13.502
I stunned her but I
need to reset her.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:17.105
Go, do it now.

01:26:18.307 --> 01:26:19.742
And take this.

01:26:19.742 --> 01:26:20.576
Just in case.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.028
(ominous music)

01:26:48.304 --> 01:26:50.239
(sinister music)

01:26:50.239 --> 01:26:52.508
(thudding)

01:26:57.246 --> 01:26:59.415
(gasping)

01:27:00.449 --> 01:27:02.651
(groaning)

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:11.460
Joanna?

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:15.398
You are awake now, Rick.

01:27:15.398 --> 01:27:17.700
Awake and hungry.

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.101
Dinner is ready.

01:27:20.135 --> 01:27:21.737
What is this?

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:22.571
Dinner.

01:27:28.344 --> 01:27:29.678
Sit down.

01:27:29.678 --> 01:27:31.780
We have guests.

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:33.916
Doesn't this look
wonderful, Rick?

01:27:35.418 --> 01:27:37.486
This food looks wonderful.

01:27:38.621 --> 01:27:40.823
Fixing the flat
has made me hungry.

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:43.225
Sit down, Rick.

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:45.928
What the hell is this?!

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:47.296
Family dinner.

01:27:47.296 --> 01:27:48.597
You can't just recreate.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:50.165
This isn't a family!

01:27:54.837 --> 01:27:56.238
The old versions of your friends

01:27:56.238 --> 01:27:58.240
have different intentions.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.876
Once silenced, it
can be recreated

01:28:00.876 --> 01:28:02.578
and made perfect once more.

01:28:03.479 --> 01:28:04.913
Perfect family.

01:28:04.913 --> 01:28:07.483
Perfect dinner, perfect
family-dinner-sister.

01:28:07.483 --> 01:28:09.318
Perfect family dinner.

01:28:09.318 --> 01:28:11.487
I will get the dinner.

01:28:11.487 --> 01:28:13.989
(eerie music)

01:28:15.157 --> 01:28:20.095
I will put fish in
my tummy for dinner.

01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:22.531
(buzzing)

01:28:29.505 --> 01:28:31.474
(groaning)

01:28:31.474 --> 01:28:33.409
(eerie music)

01:28:33.409 --> 01:28:35.110
I must eliminate you.

01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:36.679
You are threatening me.

01:28:36.679 --> 01:28:38.714
I love you, Rick,
I must kill you!

01:28:38.714 --> 01:28:41.350
I love you, family
dinner, I love you.

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.519
(buzzing)

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:08.010
Hmmm.

01:29:10.513 --> 01:29:12.615
Smells good, honey.

01:29:12.615 --> 01:29:13.516
Thank you.

01:29:20.489 --> 01:29:21.424
Where are you going?

01:29:21.424 --> 01:29:23.025
- [Rick] To the bathroom.

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:23.859
Fine.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.161
Don't be too long.

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:27.596
- [Rick] I won't.

01:29:29.331 --> 01:29:31.834
(eerie music)

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:39.374
(electronic buzzing)

01:29:42.645 --> 01:29:45.981
(electronic beat music)
