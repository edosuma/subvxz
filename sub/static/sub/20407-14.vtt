00:00.258 --> 00:01.959
(Male announcer)
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen,</i>

00:02.025 --> 00:04.035
Chef Ramsay gave
the final four

00:04.094 --> 00:06.296
their most
difficult challenge yet.

00:06.364 --> 00:08.098
The person that comes
closest

00:08.166 --> 00:09.566
<i>to recreating this dish</i>
<i>wins the challenge.</i>

00:09.634 --> 00:11.301
(Announcer)
Taste it, now make it.

00:11.369 --> 00:11.735
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Taste, taste, taste.</i>

00:11.803 --> 00:12.970
Taste.

00:13.038 --> 00:14.204
(Announcer)
They had to replicate

00:14.272 --> 00:15.205
Chef Ramsay's dish,

00:15.273 --> 00:16.540
and it was between...

00:16.608 --> 00:17.841
Nona had veal
as the main protein.

00:17.909 --> 00:19.176
You are correct.

00:19.244 --> 00:20.844
(Announcer)
Russell and Nona.

00:20.912 --> 00:24.014
There is one dish that is
slightly in front.

00:24.082 --> 00:26.216
Congratulations.
Nona, well done.

00:26.284 --> 00:28.619
Yay!

00:28.687 --> 00:30.888
(Announcer)
It was a slim,
but overwhelming victory

00:30.955 --> 00:31.955
for the woman
from Georgia.

00:32.023 --> 00:33.490
[Laughing]

00:33.558 --> 00:36.093
Then Chef Ramsay turned
his attention to Jillian...

00:36.161 --> 00:37.961
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>I want two minutes</i>
<i>with you. Let's go.</i>

00:38.029 --> 00:39.430
(Announcer)
Who seemed rattled

00:39.497 --> 00:40.664
in the last
dinner service.

00:40.732 --> 00:42.166
<i>You've got to learn</i>
<i>to fight back.</i>

00:42.233 --> 00:44.168
I can do that.

00:44.235 --> 00:46.270
(Announcer)
The pep talk seemed to work...

00:46.337 --> 00:47.504
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Jillian! Delicious garnish.</i>

00:47.572 --> 00:49.239
Thank you, Chef.

00:49.307 --> 00:50.607
(Announcer)
As Jillian had
a near-perfect service.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.711
Chef Jillian in da house!

00:53.778 --> 00:55.079
(Announcer)
The same could not be said

00:55.146 --> 00:56.080
for Russell and Trev.

00:56.147 --> 00:57.881
Come on, bro!

00:57.949 --> 00:59.249
(Announcer)
They continued
to battle in the kitchen.

00:59.317 --> 01:00.284
You asked me how long.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.852
<i>I gave you a time!</i>

01:01.920 --> 01:03.287
<i>Don't just sit there</i>
<i>and say, "I knew it."</i>

01:03.354 --> 01:04.455
<i>(Trev)</i>
<i>Just shut up.</i>

01:04.522 --> 01:05.789
(Announcer)
And in the dorm.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.124
If you talk to me like
you talked before,

01:07.192 --> 01:08.158
I will slap
the [Bleep] Out of you.

01:08.226 --> 01:09.893
Whoa!

01:09.961 --> 01:11.829
(Announcer)
When it came time
to send someone home,

01:11.896 --> 01:13.063
Chef Ramsay surprised
everyone.

01:13.131 --> 01:14.932
Russell.

01:14.999 --> 01:18.202
<i>It's time for you to</i>
<i>meet your mum and dad</i>

01:18.269 --> 01:19.870
oh, my God.

01:19.938 --> 01:21.438
(Announcer)
By bringing
a little piece of home

01:21.506 --> 01:22.573
to <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

01:22.640 --> 01:24.475
That's my baby boy.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.810
Because we had
a very good service,

01:26.878 --> 01:29.246
<i>i decided</i>
<i>to not eliminate someone.</i>

01:29.314 --> 01:30.981
(Announcer)
And so on the heels

01:31.049 --> 01:32.483
of a strong dinner service
performance,

01:32.550 --> 01:34.451
the final four
got a reprieve

01:34.519 --> 01:36.653

And now the continuation

02:42.220 --> 02:43.387
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:49.327 --> 02:51.128
Thank you.

02:51.196 --> 02:55.833
I can not believe I just
saw my husband and my baby.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.267
I cannot believe it.

02:59.337 --> 03:00.804
No one is going to tell me

03:00.872 --> 03:02.806
that I cannot do this
for my family.

03:02.874 --> 03:04.541
I didn't expect
to see Annie.

03:04.609 --> 03:05.709
Is that your baby sister?

03:05.777 --> 03:06.844
Yeah.

03:06.911 --> 03:08.412
Seeing my little sister
show up,

03:08.479 --> 03:10.647
it really kindled
the spark.

03:10.715 --> 03:12.416
That whole reason
that I'm here

03:12.483 --> 03:14.651
is because she believes
that I can do this.

03:14.719 --> 03:16.553
I have this sense
of hope again.

03:16.621 --> 03:21.225
<i>God, that</i>
<i>was so awesome.</i>

03:21.292 --> 03:22.826
Now you remember
why you came?

03:22.894 --> 03:24.294
(Jillian)
Winning <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

03:24.362 --> 03:25.729
would change my life.

03:25.797 --> 03:27.130
I live in a basement

03:27.198 --> 03:28.765
at my boyfriend's
mom's house.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.767
I need to give my kids
a life that they deserve.

03:30.835 --> 03:31.869
That's why I'm here.

03:36.608 --> 03:37.875
(Announcer)
After an emotional evening

03:37.942 --> 03:39.243
with their families,

03:39.310 --> 03:40.777
the Chefs
are more motivated

03:40.845 --> 03:43.146
and more determined
than ever.

03:43.214 --> 03:44.781
This morning, they will
be tested again.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.283
Good morning.
Morning, Chef.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.352
(Announcer)
But before that begins,

03:48.419 --> 03:50.354
Chef Ramsay has some sobering
news for the final four.

03:50.421 --> 03:52.222
Now,
listen carefully.

03:52.290 --> 03:53.824
Tonight,
we're open for service,

03:53.892 --> 03:55.325
and two of you
will be going home.

03:58.129 --> 03:59.696
I don't care
who goes home,

03:59.764 --> 04:01.298
as long as I'm standing
there tonight

04:01.366 --> 04:02.733
in the final two.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.434
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Today's challenge</i>

04:04.502 --> 04:06.570
is one of the most
sophisticated challenges

04:06.638 --> 04:08.305
we've ever had in the history
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

04:08.373 --> 04:10.807
<i>Each of you will</i>
<i>design and create</i>

04:10.875 --> 04:12.609
<i>a stunning dish using</i>
<i>the combination</i>

04:12.677 --> 04:14.912
of two cuisines,
better known as fusion.

04:16.581 --> 04:18.849
I've never cooked
fusion in my life.

04:18.916 --> 04:21.584
I don't even cook anything
but, like, American food.

04:21.653 --> 04:23.487
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Each of you will be working</i>

04:23.554 --> 04:25.022
with different ingredients
from around the world.

04:25.089 --> 04:26.957
They include India...

04:27.025 --> 04:27.991
Uhh...

04:28.059 --> 04:30.193
Greece, Spain,
Thailand.

04:32.163 --> 04:34.398
China, Italy, France.

04:34.465 --> 04:36.233
I normally eat
hot dogs, hamburgers,

04:36.301 --> 04:37.301
biscuits and gravy.

04:37.368 --> 04:39.169
Finally, Mexico.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.370
[Sighs]

04:40.438 --> 04:42.739
This is gonna be hard.

04:42.807 --> 04:44.441
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>So there you see</i>

04:44.509 --> 04:46.109
<i>different ingredients</i>
<i>from around the world,</i>

04:46.177 --> 04:48.445
<i>each table representing</i>
<i>a distinct cuisine.</i>

04:48.513 --> 04:50.047
<i>You excited?</i>
Yes, Chef.

04:50.114 --> 04:51.648
<i>This is how</i>
<i>it's gonna work.</i>

04:51.716 --> 04:53.350
Under this dome,
there are eight flags.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.118
I'm gonna call you
one at a time.

04:55.186 --> 04:56.320
You're gonna pull
two flags.

04:56.387 --> 04:57.487
Nona?
Yes?

04:57.555 --> 04:59.222
<i>Off you go.</i>

04:59.290 --> 05:00.958
(Announcer)
In Chef Ramsay's
fusion challenge,

05:01.025 --> 05:02.192
he will be testing
the Chefs' creativity,

05:02.260 --> 05:04.027
as they have to create
a spectacular dish

05:04.095 --> 05:05.929
from the two countries
they select.

05:05.997 --> 05:07.297
You have...

05:07.365 --> 05:09.733
Yay! Greece!
Wow, wow, wow.

05:09.801 --> 05:11.168
<i>[Giggling]</i>

05:11.235 --> 05:13.870
Greece.
Sweet!

05:13.938 --> 05:15.238

fusing it with...

05:15.306 --> 05:16.873
Come on.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.375
Wow, Greece and Italy.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.710
Ha! Okay.

05:19.777 --> 05:21.144
How easy is that?

05:21.212 --> 05:23.513
Those two mirror
each other in cuisine.

05:23.581 --> 05:25.048
Sweet.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.417
Jillian, let's go.

05:27.485 --> 05:28.919
Thailand.
Aha

05:30.621 --> 05:33.423
<i>Thailand, you're</i>
<i>gonna pair it with...</i>

05:33.491 --> 05:34.791
Wow, Spain.

05:34.859 --> 05:38.695
Spain and Thailand
together, fusion.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.165
<i>Russell.</i>

05:42.233 --> 05:43.934
Please,
just let me get France.

05:44.002 --> 05:46.103
I can make something happen
if I get France.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.304
France.
<i>Vive la France.</i>

05:47.372 --> 05:48.305

<i>and you're gonna</i>
<i>fuse it with...</i>

France and India.

Nice.

<i>It's not a bad place</i>

<i>Viva la Mexico!</i>

06:10.695 --> 06:12.929
Mexico and China,
two distinct cuisines.

I'm thinking maybe
burrito pot stickers?

06:16.801 --> 06:18.101
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>45 minutes,</i>

06:18.169 --> 06:21.038
one dish,
starting from now.

06:21.105 --> 06:23.707
(Announcer)
The Chefs may choose as
many ingredients as they like.

06:25.943 --> 06:27.811
It is important
that Chef Ramsay

06:27.879 --> 06:29.780
is able to recognize
the contribution

06:29.847 --> 06:31.948
that each country's cuisine
had made to their dish.

06:32.016 --> 06:34.084
Check out
your protein, guys.

06:34.152 --> 06:35.552
(Russell)
This is the challenge
for the real Chefs.

06:35.620 --> 06:36.820
I have a good shot
at winning,

06:36.888 --> 06:38.321
because I'm a great Chef,

06:38.389 --> 06:39.990
and, you know, I'm not
gonna settle for second place.

06:40.058 --> 06:41.625
Okay, five minutes gone.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.393
Here we go. This ought
to be interesting.

06:43.461 --> 06:45.162
(Announcer)
While Russell, Nona, and Trev

06:45.229 --> 06:47.397
are already cooking,
Jillian...

06:47.465 --> 06:49.032
Don't even know
what those are.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.100

Is still searching.

06:50.168 --> 06:53.403
Cockles?
Mung bean?

06:53.471 --> 06:55.338
I don't know what
any of that [Bleep] Is.

06:55.406 --> 06:57.074
I've never seen
those vegetables or fruit

06:57.141 --> 06:58.075
or whatever that is.

06:58.142 --> 06:59.576
No idea.

06:59.644 --> 07:01.144
What the [Bleep] Am I gonna do
with all this?

07:01.212 --> 07:02.879
That smells good.

07:02.947 --> 07:05.949
Puttin' some of that
on there.

07:06.017 --> 07:07.184
30 minutes to go, yes?

07:07.251 --> 07:08.185
Yes, Chef.

07:08.252 --> 07:09.286
Nona, what are you using?

07:09.353 --> 07:10.487
Shrimp and mussels.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.922
Shrimp and mussels?

07:11.989 --> 07:13.890
<i>Roasted tomatoes,</i>
<i>balsamic.</i>

07:13.958 --> 07:15.659
<i>And a chickpea,</i>
<i>roasted chickpea</i>

07:15.726 --> 07:17.461
with maraschino cherries.

07:17.528 --> 07:20.797
I want to incorporate
both countries equally,

07:20.865 --> 07:24.167
so I'm trying to pack it
just chock full

07:24.235 --> 07:25.802
of all of the ingredients.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.537
Mmm.

07:27.605 --> 07:29.005
What you got goin' on?

07:29.073 --> 07:30.107
Duck foie gras
a l'orange.

07:30.174 --> 07:31.341
I'm gonna use duck

07:31.409 --> 07:33.877
because
it's so clearly french.

07:33.945 --> 07:35.946
I gonna use foie gras,
because it's so clearly french.

07:39.383 --> 07:40.650
Ah, [Bleep].

07:40.718 --> 07:42.385
Marmalade.
This marmalade's Indian.

07:42.453 --> 07:43.720
Pfff!

07:43.788 --> 07:45.555
15 minutes to go, yes?

07:45.623 --> 07:47.991
I don't think those beans
are gonna be done in time, man.

07:48.059 --> 07:48.959
Your beans?
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:49.026 --> 07:50.260
<i>Okay, backup plan.</i>

07:50.328 --> 07:52.262
No beans.
What else can I use?

07:52.330 --> 07:53.864
This is not good.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.867
Gonna try to get
some kind of starch cooking.

07:56.934 --> 07:57.901
Nine minutes to go,
guys, yes?

07:57.969 --> 07:58.902
Yes, Chef.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.604
Hi, my name's Trevor,

08:00.671 --> 08:02.205
and today, we're gonna
take a little bit of China,

08:02.273 --> 08:03.673
take a little bit
of Mexico

08:03.741 --> 08:04.307
and see what we
can't come up with.

08:04.375 --> 08:05.775
Whoo! Like it.

08:05.843 --> 08:07.177
Some peppers,
habaneros, some hot sauce,

08:07.245 --> 08:08.512
some chili sauce

08:08.579 --> 08:11.181
got a lot of spice
going on today.

08:11.249 --> 08:12.949
Let the fun begin.

08:13.017 --> 08:15.619
Something burning?

08:15.686 --> 08:16.620
Spicy, spicy.

08:18.556 --> 08:20.357
Definitely gonna have
some heartburn

08:20.424 --> 08:21.691
after you get done eating,
that's for sure.

08:23.928 --> 08:25.228
Watch your hair.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.329
[Laughter]

08:26.397 --> 08:28.165
Ha ha, real funny.

08:28.232 --> 08:29.766
Five minutes to go,
yes?

08:29.834 --> 08:31.968
[Bleep] Beans aren't
gonna be done in time.

08:32.035 --> 08:35.105
Everyone else's dishes
looked immaculate.

08:35.173 --> 08:37.240
Last 30.
Nice.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.575
My dish sucks.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.309
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Five, four,</i>

08:40.378 --> 08:42.445
<i>three, two,</i>

08:42.513 --> 08:43.780
<i>one, and stop.</i>

08:47.151 --> 08:48.785
Okay, it's time
to meet our judges.

08:48.853 --> 08:50.554
Please welcome
our first judge.

08:50.621 --> 08:52.756
<i>Philip Dubose,</i>
<i>Executive Chef</i>

08:52.823 --> 08:54.157
<i>from Asia de Cuba</i>

08:54.225 --> 08:55.892
and an expert
in bending latin

08:55.960 --> 08:57.594
and asian cuisines.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.728
[Applause]
Good morning, Chef.

08:58.796 --> 09:00.230
Good morning, Chef.

09:00.298 --> 09:03.233
<i>Our next judge,</i>
<i>please welcome Helene An.</i>

09:03.301 --> 09:06.970
<i>She has been known</i>
<i>as the mother of fusion,</i>

09:07.038 --> 09:08.371
<i>the Executive Chef,</i>
<i>Crustacean.</i>

09:08.439 --> 09:10.740
Finally, our last judge.

09:10.808 --> 09:13.076
Please welcome Lee Hefter,

09:13.144 --> 09:15.512
award-winning Executive Chef
of Spago.

09:15.580 --> 09:19.049
(Jillian)
World-class Chefs are
going to taste my dish.

09:19.116 --> 09:21.885
I'm a [Bleep]
Nervous wreck.

09:21.953 --> 09:23.853
Let's start
with Trev,

09:23.921 --> 09:26.523
<i>who fused China</i>
<i>and Mexico together.</i>

09:26.591 --> 09:29.593
If Trev got Mexico
and Texas,

09:29.660 --> 09:30.994
Trev couldn't make
a flavor combination

09:31.062 --> 09:31.995
to save his life.

09:32.063 --> 09:32.996
<i>Good morning, Chefs.</i>

09:33.064 --> 09:34.331
Good morning.

09:34.398 --> 09:36.600
I went with carne asada,

09:36.667 --> 09:38.335
sweetened it up
a little bit.

09:38.402 --> 09:40.270
Gave it that spice
with a little bit of habanero,

09:40.338 --> 09:42.138
thought it brought it
both together pretty well.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.140
So you like chinese,
so you like mexican.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.575
Why not let the two
have a little wedding

09:45.643 --> 09:46.977
and flavor explosion?

09:47.044 --> 09:48.178
Helene,
how was that for you.

09:48.246 --> 09:49.646
A little bland.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.947
A little bland?
Okay.

09:51.015 --> 09:52.315
[Laughing]

09:52.383 --> 09:53.516
I would say that it
is a little bland.

09:53.584 --> 09:54.584
Wow.

09:54.652 --> 09:56.286
<i>It is very bland, the meat.</i>

09:56.354 --> 09:57.821
There was no marination
on the meat at all.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.489
<i>It was way off balance.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

09:59.557 --> 10:00.890
[Bleep].

10:00.958 --> 10:02.092
Nona.

10:02.159 --> 10:03.627
I feel good about my dish.

10:03.694 --> 10:05.295
It's really
a big plate of food.

10:05.363 --> 10:07.530
The flavors have really
meshed well together.

10:07.598 --> 10:09.966
Um, I had Greece
and Italy.

10:10.034 --> 10:11.134
<i>(Helene)</i>
<i>Ahh.</i>

10:11.202 --> 10:14.004
Went with a rustic
seafood ragu

10:14.071 --> 10:15.972
<i>with mussels and shrimp.</i>

10:16.040 --> 10:19.009
<i>I used a greek pasta</i>
<i>with roasted tomatoes</i>

10:19.076 --> 10:23.480
and balsamic and
some maraschino cherries

10:23.547 --> 10:25.615
and a splash
of limoncello.

10:25.683 --> 10:28.718
Wow, you definitely
combined it.

10:28.786 --> 10:31.154
Yes.

10:31.222 --> 10:32.989
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Lee, how does</i>
<i>that taste?</i>

10:33.057 --> 10:35.659
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>The mussels are cooked good,</i>

10:35.726 --> 10:38.261
and the pasta still has
a little bite to it,

10:38.329 --> 10:40.330
<i>but sometimes we have</i>
<i>problems</i>

10:40.398 --> 10:42.465
incorporating too many things
at the same time in one dish.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.134
Almost like two
separate dishes, perhaps.

10:44.201 --> 10:45.268
Right.
Yeah, absolutely.

10:45.336 --> 10:47.037
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Nona, thank you.</i>

10:47.104 --> 10:49.039
(Jillian)
If they're saying this
about Nona's dish,

10:49.106 --> 10:51.641
I don't even want to know what
they're gonna say about mine.

10:51.709 --> 10:52.976
Russell.

10:53.044 --> 10:55.512
<i>He combined</i>
<i>France and India.</i>

10:55.579 --> 10:57.347
India.
<i>Mmm.</i>

10:57.415 --> 10:58.848
Russell has the benefit
of being trained

10:58.916 --> 11:00.216
in french cuisine,

11:00.284 --> 11:01.484
so this should be
pretty easy

11:01.552 --> 11:03.019
for Mr. fancy pants.

11:03.087 --> 11:04.754
I did a take
on duck a l'orange.

11:04.822 --> 11:06.423
<i>I paired it</i>
<i>with foie gras.</i>

11:06.490 --> 11:08.191
On the duck, I marinated it
with curry powder,

11:08.259 --> 11:10.160
and then I finished it
with a tamarind syrup.

11:10.227 --> 11:12.195
<i>How's that one,</i>
<i>everybody?</i>

11:12.263 --> 11:14.264
For me, the Indian spice
in here is not enough for me.

11:14.332 --> 11:15.865
Okay.
Lee, please?

11:15.933 --> 11:17.901
The duck is overcooked,

11:17.968 --> 11:20.036
<i>but I think that</i>
<i>missing that...</i>

11:20.104 --> 11:21.538
That complete fusion
of the Indian in it.

11:21.605 --> 11:23.039
Is the duck
overcooked?

11:23.107 --> 11:23.740
The duck is definitely
overcooked, yeah.

11:23.808 --> 11:24.974
Absolutely,

11:25.042 --> 11:26.676
<i>and it is cut</i>
<i>too thick.</i>

11:26.744 --> 11:29.045
I know my dish
was the best dish served today,

11:29.113 --> 11:30.480
so you can kiss my ass.

11:30.548 --> 11:32.749
I don't give a [Bleep]
About him.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.551
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Okay, thank you, Russell.</i>

11:34.618 --> 11:36.486
(Announcer)
So far, Nona, Russell, and Trev

11:36.554 --> 11:38.621
have all had
their share of criticism.

11:38.689 --> 11:40.056
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Ah, dear,</i>
<i>how disappointing.</i>

11:40.124 --> 11:43.560
Okay, uh, Jillian,
you are next.

11:43.627 --> 11:46.796
(Announcer)
Now all eyes are on
a less than confident Jillian,

11:46.864 --> 11:48.698
who's about to face
the judges.

11:48.766 --> 11:50.266
Oh, [Bleep],
here we go.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.736
<i>They all had some kind</i>
<i>of criticism.</i>

11:52.803 --> 11:54.204
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Thailand and Spain.</i>

11:54.271 --> 11:56.373
That's
an interesting combination.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.908
I'm having a nervous
[Bleep] Breakdown.

11:58.976 --> 12:00.143
I'm screwed.

12:07.242 --> 12:09.176
(Announcer)
Today, the Chefs have been
challenged

12:09.244 --> 12:11.145
to combine cuisines
from two countries

12:11.212 --> 12:13.680
into one amazing
fusion dish.

12:13.748 --> 12:15.849
So far Trev, Nona, and Russell

12:15.917 --> 12:18.118
have all failed
to impress the judges.

12:18.186 --> 12:19.686
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Jillian, Thailand</i>
<i>and Spain, please.</i>

12:19.754 --> 12:21.288
That's an interesting
combination.

12:21.356 --> 12:23.257
(Announcer)
An Jillian has little hope

12:23.324 --> 12:24.691
she will do much better.

12:24.759 --> 12:26.493
(Jillian)
The judges were harsh,

12:26.561 --> 12:28.595
and that kind of
freaked me out a little bit.

12:28.663 --> 12:30.731
This is the most important
challenge of my life.

12:30.799 --> 12:33.267
I chose white rice,

12:33.334 --> 12:35.102
a little bit
of marinated shrimp.

12:35.170 --> 12:36.637
I threw some chorizo
in there,

12:36.704 --> 12:38.472
<i>and then marinated</i>
<i>my shrimp</i>

12:38.540 --> 12:40.541
in a little bit
of spicy mayonnaise

12:40.608 --> 12:44.144
<i>and some soybean curd.</i>

12:44.212 --> 12:46.013
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Helene, how was that</i>
<i>for you?</i>

12:46.080 --> 12:47.781
Interesting dish.

12:50.018 --> 12:51.819
I like it.

12:51.886 --> 12:53.086
Thank you.

12:53.154 --> 12:54.922
I think it's
a nice-tasting dish.

12:54.989 --> 12:56.256
It's seasoned well.

12:57.692 --> 12:58.859
Thank you
very much.

12:58.927 --> 13:00.561
It looks
like a thai paella.

13:00.628 --> 13:02.930
Perfect. That's exactly
what I was going for.

13:02.997 --> 13:04.665
It is very good.
Thank you

13:04.732 --> 13:05.999
would you be happy
to see that on your menu?

13:06.067 --> 13:07.100
Yes.

13:07.168 --> 13:09.603
Better get a job, man,
for real.

13:09.671 --> 13:10.971
That went down well.
Thank you.

13:11.039 --> 13:12.005
Thank you
very much, Chef.

13:12.073 --> 13:13.373
I appreciate it.

13:13.441 --> 13:14.775
(Announcer)
Remarkably, Jillian

13:14.843 --> 13:15.943
is the only Chef
to receive praise

13:16.010 --> 13:17.778
from all the judges.

13:17.846 --> 13:19.479
Which dish did
you like best?

13:19.547 --> 13:20.347
(Announcer)
And so picking the winner...

13:20.415 --> 13:21.682
Jillian.

13:21.749 --> 13:23.450
I would have to go
with Jillian as well.

13:23.518 --> 13:25.085
(Announcer)
Is an easy decision.

13:25.153 --> 13:26.220
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Is it unanimous?</i>

13:26.287 --> 13:27.321
Unanimously,
I would go for it.

13:27.388 --> 13:29.456
Thank you, Chef.

13:29.524 --> 13:31.191
A round of applause
for our judges, please.

13:31.259 --> 13:32.893
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:32.961 --> 13:34.628
Thank you.

13:34.696 --> 13:35.796
Yeah!

13:35.864 --> 13:37.664
Across the board,
I won that.

13:37.732 --> 13:39.099
Ha ha, Russell.

13:39.167 --> 13:41.168
This just proves
why I'm still here,

13:41.236 --> 13:43.070
and I do have
creativity.

13:43.137 --> 13:44.404
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Jillian, congratulations,</i>

13:44.472 --> 13:46.039
thank you, Chef.

13:46.107 --> 13:48.275
You and I are gonna
be having an amazing lunch

13:48.343 --> 13:50.978
at one of the most renowned
restaurants in the world,

13:51.045 --> 13:53.113
Spago.

13:53.181 --> 13:55.482
<i>Wow, enjoy it.</i>

13:55.550 --> 13:57.484
<i>Nona, Russell, Trev,</i>

13:57.552 --> 13:59.119
the dorm is furnished
for 16,

13:59.187 --> 14:00.220
and there's only
four of you left,

14:00.288 --> 14:03.657
so today's
a move-out day.

14:03.725 --> 14:06.360
<i>In addition to that,</i>
<i>we're open for dinner tonight,</i>

14:06.427 --> 14:07.427
<i>so prep the kitchen.</i>

14:07.495 --> 14:09.396
A big service, yes?

14:09.464 --> 14:10.530
Yep.

14:10.598 --> 14:11.965
<i>Jillian?</i>
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

14:12.033 --> 14:13.734
Limo's gonna
be here shortly, yes?

14:13.801 --> 14:15.235
I'll see you
in a couple of minutes.

14:15.303 --> 14:16.236
Yes, Chef.
<i>Well done.</i>

14:16.304 --> 14:17.604
Thank you, Chef.

14:17.672 --> 14:18.972
I'm so happy, man.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.574
Like, I am flipping
out right now,

14:20.642 --> 14:22.509
because we're going to lunch
in a limo!

14:22.577 --> 14:23.977
Oh, my God, I gotta wear

14:24.045 --> 14:25.579
my expensive tall-girl
shoes today,

14:25.647 --> 14:26.980
so I can look good.

14:27.048 --> 14:29.349
Hi, Chef.

14:29.417 --> 14:32.185
<i>[Giggles]</i>

14:32.253 --> 14:33.520
You look beautiful.

14:33.588 --> 14:34.955
Let's go, my darling.

14:35.023 --> 14:36.456
I have hard time
walking in tall shoes.

14:36.524 --> 14:38.258
You look great.
Good to see you.

14:38.326 --> 14:40.527
Welcome.
Please, jump in.

14:40.595 --> 14:41.995
(Jillian)
I am so excited.

14:42.063 --> 14:43.630
Like, Chef Ramsay
is so cool

14:43.698 --> 14:45.699
when he's not
in the kitchen yelling at you

14:45.767 --> 14:47.167
and you just get to talk to him
like a regular person.

14:47.235 --> 14:49.002
How do you feel?
Wonderful.

14:49.070 --> 14:50.137
<i>I was so glad</i>
<i>you won.</i>

14:50.204 --> 14:52.105
Thanks. Me, too.

14:52.173 --> 14:53.874
Tough one,
that one.

14:53.942 --> 14:55.676
I'm just glad to beat
Russell at anything, honestly.

14:55.743 --> 14:57.711
Yeah. Sometimes he's
too cocky for his own good,

14:57.779 --> 14:59.446
in a way that he thinks
it's in the bag,

14:59.514 --> 15:00.814
and it's not in the bag.

15:00.882 --> 15:02.215
No.
<i>One in four chance.</i>

15:02.283 --> 15:03.784
You are that close.

15:03.851 --> 15:05.185
It's amazing.

15:05.253 --> 15:07.354
Talking to Chef Ramsay
is a huge inspiration.

15:07.422 --> 15:09.456
You've really upped your game,
which is great.

15:09.524 --> 15:12.459
I feel like I got
just as good a chance as anyone

15:12.527 --> 15:13.660
to make it to the final two.

15:15.663 --> 15:17.197
[Backup signal beeping]

15:17.265 --> 15:18.899
[Horn blares]

22:26.248 --> 22:27.682
Service, please.

22:27.749 --> 22:29.483
(Announcer)
Russell is off to a good start.

22:29.551 --> 22:31.052
It's good.
It's really good.

22:31.119 --> 22:32.787
Taste, taste, taste, yes?
Yes, Chef.

22:32.854 --> 22:34.121
(Announcer)
However, his quality control

22:34.189 --> 22:35.656
is about to be tested.

22:35.724 --> 22:37.091
4 1/2 out
on two scallops,

22:37.159 --> 22:38.192
go with two truffle
salads.

22:38.260 --> 22:40.161
Plating two salads.

22:40.228 --> 22:42.163
(Announcer)
As Chef Scott tries
to pull one over on him

22:42.230 --> 22:43.998
bu using pecans
instead of walnuts

22:44.066 --> 22:46.000
in the truffle salads.

22:46.068 --> 22:47.935
Two salads?

22:48.003 --> 22:50.471
Two salads, Chef.

22:50.539 --> 22:52.673
I've come this far.
I've put out a lot of effort.

22:52.741 --> 22:54.308
The expectations and
the standards are gonna be high.

22:54.376 --> 22:55.676
If anybody tries
to sabotage me tonight,

22:55.744 --> 22:56.644
I'm gonna catch 'em.

22:56.712 --> 22:59.747
Happy with the salads?

22:59.815 --> 23:00.948
No!

23:01.016 --> 23:02.950
Chef, Chef.

23:03.018 --> 23:04.719
Can I get--
can I get walnuts?

23:04.786 --> 23:06.754
Those aren't walnuts?

23:06.822 --> 23:07.888
No, those are pecans.

23:07.956 --> 23:09.123
(Scott)
Oh, wow.

23:09.191 --> 23:10.625
I've proved
from day to day

23:10.692 --> 23:11.692
that, you know, I have
leadership qualities.

23:11.760 --> 23:12.893
Well spotted
that's good.

23:12.961 --> 23:14.195
This is my time to shine,

23:14.262 --> 23:15.529
and I'm gonna [Bleep] Shine.

23:17.899 --> 23:19.333
<i>Two truffle salads,</i>

23:19.401 --> 23:20.668

one scallop, six minutes.

23:20.736 --> 23:22.136
Okay!

23:22.204 --> 23:23.437
Trevor,
you heard me? Six?

23:23.505 --> 23:25.272
I heard!
I said heard!

23:25.340 --> 23:27.308
Russ is a thug.
He's a jocko. He's a meathead.

23:27.376 --> 23:28.476
How long
you out, Trevor?

23:28.543 --> 23:29.477
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

23:29.544 --> 23:31.245
Scallops coming!

23:31.313 --> 23:32.713
All he wants to do
is throw me under the bus,

23:32.781 --> 23:34.515
sell me down the river,

23:34.583 --> 23:36.651
blame me for anything
and everything that he can.

23:36.718 --> 23:38.419
No [Bleep] Way.

23:38.487 --> 23:39.420
It's raw.
What's that?

23:39.488 --> 23:41.555
Raw.

23:41.623 --> 23:42.757
<i>Hey! Come on,</i>
<i>[Bleep] Raw.</i>

23:42.824 --> 23:43.658
<i>It's not even close.</i>

23:43.725 --> 23:44.992
I can't serve that.

23:45.060 --> 23:46.160
Get another one
going right away.

23:46.228 --> 23:47.328
Fine!

23:47.396 --> 23:49.497
Right there, whatever.

23:49.564 --> 23:51.332
Jillian?
Yes, Chef?

23:51.400 --> 23:54.001
Get him a [Bleep] Scallop
fired, please.

23:54.069 --> 23:55.436
Get your scallops

23:55.504 --> 23:57.138
I'm goin' with the scallops!

23:57.205 --> 23:59.140
<i>You don't gotta yell!</i>
<i>I'm trying to help you out!</i>

23:59.207 --> 24:00.408
You're the one that's
yelling at me, Jillian!

24:00.475 --> 24:01.575
I was asking you, Trev.

24:01.643 --> 24:03.010
You don't
gotta get [Bleep].

24:03.078 --> 24:04.745
Not the one
coppin' a 'tude.

24:04.813 --> 24:05.746
Help yourself then.

24:05.814 --> 24:06.814
I'm dying now here.

24:06.882 --> 24:08.182
I'm in the [Bleep].

24:08.250 --> 24:09.650
Let's go, Trevor!

24:09.718 --> 24:10.618

Let's go!

24:10.686 --> 24:12.019

Wow.

24:17.259 --> 24:18.893
Make it [Bleep] Happen,

Tonight Chef Ramsay is testing

24:29.736 --> 24:31.503
the finalists'
ability to run the kitchen.

24:31.571 --> 24:34.639
Russell easily passed
his quality control test.

24:34.707 --> 24:35.974
Let's go, Trevor.

24:36.042 --> 24:36.908

But is having trouble

24:40.179 --> 24:41.279

24:41.347 --> 24:42.781
Getting on my
ass about it

24:42.849 --> 24:43.882
isn't gonna make it
go any faster.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.283
Wow.

24:45.351 --> 24:46.985
Make it [Bleep] Happen,
please.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.920
It's in!

24:48.988 --> 24:50.722
<i>Hey, come on!</i>
<i>Hey, stop it!</i>

24:50.790 --> 24:52.591
Come on, guys,
we can't [Bleep] Argue about it.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.392
It's not gonna help anything.
Let's go!

24:53.459 --> 24:54.726
Yes, Chef.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.128
Just get it done

24:56.195 --> 24:58.530

24:58.598 --> 25:01.466
(Announcer)
With Russell regaining
control of the kitchen,

25:01.534 --> 25:03.502
food is once again making
it out to the dining room.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.370
Well done. Let's go.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.272
Yeah, and run your section.
Well done.

25:07.340 --> 25:08.473
Chef Scott,
switch back.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.409
Good.
Thank you, Chef.

25:10.476 --> 25:12.044
Right, Nona.
<i>Yes, Chef?</i>

25:12.111 --> 25:14.112
Pass your section
over to Scott. Let's go.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.747
I'm anxious, I'm nervous.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.416
This is the make
or break you service.

25:17.483 --> 25:18.650
This is it.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.118
Watch everything,
taste everything,

25:20.186 --> 25:21.453
and make sure
you're on the game, yes?

25:21.521 --> 25:23.355
Two people
are going home tonight,

25:23.423 --> 25:25.590
and I damn sure
don't want to be one of them.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.159
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Come on, Nona.</i>

25:27.226 --> 25:29.461
<i>Gotta convict it.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

25:29.529 --> 25:32.597
What's next, non?

25:32.665 --> 25:34.766
Away, four top,
two scallops,

25:34.834 --> 25:36.401
one spaghetti,
one truffle salad.

25:36.469 --> 25:37.369
Yes, Chef.
Yes, Chef.

25:37.437 --> 25:38.403
Come on, scallops.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.038
Scallops are working!

25:40.106 --> 25:41.239
Nona, salad's
on your left.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.340
Scallops coming down.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.608
Go, please

25:43.676 --> 25:45.177
(announcer)
With Nona in command...

25:45.244 --> 25:46.645
Thanks, James.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.979
(Announcer)
The kitchen is running smoothly.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.414
Mash, please.

25:49.482 --> 25:51.283
Coming right now.
It's a little loose.

25:51.350 --> 25:52.951
(Announcer)
But she's about to face

25:53.019 --> 25:53.819
he first quality
control test.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.720
Waiting on mash.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.889
Wellingtons for you.
Beef are coming.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.391
(Announcer)
As Chef Scott delivers
mashed celery root

25:59.459 --> 26:01.359
instead of mashed potatoes.

26:01.427 --> 26:02.494
Taste, taste, taste,
yes?

26:13.272 --> 26:15.507
Stop.
Bring that back.

26:15.575 --> 26:16.775
Stop. Hugh.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.110
Listen to me. Stop.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.411
Taste that.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.216
What is that?

26:24.283 --> 26:25.717
It tastes like mash.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.119
[Bleep]In' hell.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.020
You can't taste
celery root there?

26:29.088 --> 26:31.056
No.
It celery root mash.

26:31.124 --> 26:33.992
I don't know if my palate's
all jacked up today or what.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.627
It truly does
taste like potato.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.262
I'm sorry.
It really did.

26:37.330 --> 26:38.763
<i>That is celery</i>
<i>root mash.</i>

26:38.831 --> 26:41.366
Can I get two--
two potato mash, please.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.668
Two mash.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.370
Nothing escapes your eye.
Nothing, yes?

26:45.438 --> 26:46.238
Yes, Chef.
Come on.

26:48.307 --> 26:49.875
I have not performed
to my full potential yet.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.343
I know that I can do better.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.444
I'm letting myself down.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.249
Russell, we need
a little more seasoning

26:57.316 --> 26:58.483
in the chowder, please.

26:58.551 --> 26:59.718
It's time
to cut the crap, man.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.853
I have got to step it up.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.689
Away, two beef,
two Wellington.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.091
Slicing my beef.

27:06.159 --> 27:07.526
Behind, behind,
left-hand side.

27:07.593 --> 27:08.593
Left-hand side.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.195
Here you go, beef.

27:10.263 --> 27:12.831
Here you go, non.
Thanks.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.799
(Announcer)
It's an hour and a half
into dinner service.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.168
Service, please.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.903
(Announcer)
And Nona and Russell

27:17.970 --> 27:19.604
have managed to feed
half the dining room.

27:19.672 --> 27:22.641
Well done.
Let's go.

27:22.708 --> 27:24.009
Okay, Scott, take over
the fish, please.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.310
<i>Ready, Trev?</i>

27:25.378 --> 27:26.578
(Announcer)
Now it's up to Trev

27:26.646 --> 27:27.812
to keep the momentum going.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.714
All right, new order,

27:29.782 --> 27:30.982
one spaghetti,
two scallops,

27:31.050 --> 27:33.285
one truffle salad.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.786
How long?

27:37.290 --> 27:39.624
(Jillian)
Nobody's listening
to anything Trev says.

27:39.692 --> 27:41.226
Just like, "blah blah blah,"
coming out his mouth.

27:41.294 --> 27:42.627
Knock it out, guys.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.196
Let's get 'em in,
get 'em out.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.463
Answer him.

27:45.531 --> 27:46.898
(Jillian)
Nobody respects him,

27:46.966 --> 27:48.266
and that's why,
while he's on the pass,

27:48.334 --> 27:49.868
everyone's ignoring him.

27:49.936 --> 27:52.871
One spaghetti, two scallops,
one truffle salad.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.039
Is there an answer?

27:54.106 --> 27:56.274
Yes, Chef!
Yes, Chef!

27:56.342 --> 27:58.543
(Announcer)
The Chefs may not be
listening to Trev,

27:58.611 --> 28:00.412
but that doesn't stop him
from calling more tickets.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.480
One salmon, two beef,
one Wellington,

28:02.548 --> 28:04.249
six minutes
to the window!

28:04.317 --> 28:06.151
<i>(Chefs)</i>
<i>Six minutes!</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

28:06.219 --> 28:09.688
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Stop, two people</i>
<i>on salmon, Wellington!</i>

28:09.755 --> 28:13.124
<i>'Cause you haven't sent</i>
<i>the [Bleep] Appetizers yet!</i>

28:13.192 --> 28:14.226
Son of a bitch.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.728
Son of a bitch?
Oh, no!

28:16.796 --> 28:19.397
[Bleep] Hell's right.

28:19.465 --> 28:20.465
Trev sucks.

28:20.533 --> 28:21.866
Sorry, Trev, you suck.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.868
Come on, Trevor!

28:23.936 --> 28:25.737
(Announcer)
With Trev at the pass,

28:25.805 --> 28:27.205
no food has left
the kitchen.

28:27.273 --> 28:27.872
Let's go.
Halibut, please.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.674
Halibut right now!

28:29.742 --> 28:31.443
(Announcer)
And the night is
not getting any easier...

28:31.510 --> 28:33.278
Halibut.

28:33.346 --> 28:34.813
(Announcer)
As Chef Scott brings
his quality control test

28:34.880 --> 28:36.014
to the pass.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.817
This isn't
[Bleep] Halibut.

28:38.884 --> 28:39.784
<i>Come on, Chef Scott,</i>

28:39.852 --> 28:41.353
this is sea bass.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.054
If you really want to
throw me for a loop,

28:43.122 --> 28:44.122
try a little harder.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.924
Well spotted.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.993
(Announcer)
While Trev got off
to a rocky start,

28:48.060 --> 28:51.296
catching Chef Scott's sabotage
has given him some confidence.

28:51.364 --> 28:53.565
Up to the window, Jill.
Please and thank you.

28:53.633 --> 28:55.233
Getting it, go.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.835
(Announcer)
And food is starting

28:56.902 --> 28:59.004
to flow
out of the kitchen once again.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.538
Please and thank you,
get it going.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.040
I'm surrounded
by three people

29:02.108 --> 29:03.308
that think that I can't
do this.

29:03.376 --> 29:04.743
Service, please.

29:04.810 --> 29:06.578
Here is my chance
to prove to these guys

29:06.646 --> 29:08.847
that I'm
an executive Chef, too.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.548
I can do this
and better than you.

29:10.616 --> 29:11.850
That's exactly
what I did.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.618
Okay,
back on the station.

29:13.686 --> 29:15.053
<i>Okay, right,</i>
<i>Jillian, let's go.</i>

29:15.121 --> 29:16.454
Yes, Chef!

29:16.522 --> 29:18.390
I'm ready to do
the damn thing, man.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.358
I'm ready to kick
some ass tonight, taking names,

29:20.426 --> 29:22.260
and I'm ready to go
to the final two. That's it.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.695
Guys, listen up!
Entrees!

29:23.763 --> 29:24.829
Three beef,
two Wellington!

29:24.897 --> 29:27.432
Two Wellington in now!

29:27.500 --> 29:29.267
Come on, you answer me
when I talk to you!

29:29.335 --> 29:30.535
Yes, Chef!

29:30.603 --> 29:32.337
