WEBVTT

00:00.242 --> 00:01.879
We'd like to invite
you back to work.

00:02.134 --> 00:04.027
It was the right decision
to come back.

00:04.211 --> 00:05.952
I think it's helping you remember.

00:08.266 --> 00:10.012
I've got that information
you wanted.

00:13.573 --> 00:15.896
Someone I used to care about's
got a daughter in here.

00:15.896 --> 00:17.817
There's a reason why
she didn't get bail.

00:17.832 --> 00:19.757
Why?
'Cause it wasn't her first offence.

00:19.774 --> 00:22.734
Turns out she's quite the little
piss pot, just like her mum.

00:24.614 --> 00:26.100
Why couldn't you tell me about it?

00:26.135 --> 00:27.495
Soph!

00:27.678 --> 00:29.319
Can I talk to you outside?

00:29.399 --> 00:32.179
What about?
The murder of Harry Smith.

00:32.180 --> 00:33.451
Did you kill him?

00:33.453 --> 00:36.048
What's your relationship
to the victim's ex-wife, Bea Smith?

00:36.049 --> 00:37.810
Jodie's got something to say.

00:37.890 --> 00:40.770
I'll do it.
Good.

01:54.058 --> 01:55.138
Stop!

02:09.384 --> 02:11.586
You're worthless.

02:11.633 --> 02:14.294
You're pointless. No-one misses you.

02:14.323 --> 02:17.143
You're nothing.

02:17.174 --> 02:18.933
Governor.

02:19.854 --> 02:21.294
Mr Fletcher.

02:30.533 --> 02:34.014
You cut Bea Smith, then you can rest.

02:36.854 --> 02:38.373
You're worthless. Pointless.

02:38.454 --> 02:39.973
You're nothing.

02:44.614 --> 02:47.093
You're worthless. You're pointless.

02:47.174 --> 02:49.294
You're nothing.

02:52.174 --> 02:55.294
You're worthless. You're pointless.
You're nothing.

02:58.774 --> 03:00.093
Cut Bea Smith.

03:07.014 --> 03:09.253
Stop!

03:09.334 --> 03:12.454
You cut Bea Smith,
then you can rest.

03:18.413 --> 03:20.054
Governor.

03:20.133 --> 03:23.693
You're worthless. You're pointless.

03:28.653 --> 03:32.334
You're nothing.
No-one misses you.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.813
No-one cares.

03:40.093 --> 03:43.054
You're weak...
And you're stupid.

03:43.133 --> 03:45.253
But you can change all that.

03:46.294 --> 03:49.854
Cut Bea Smith and you can rest.

03:49.933 --> 03:51.413
That's what she said to me,

03:51.493 --> 03:55.294
every night,
the whole time I was in the slot.

03:55.373 --> 03:59.693
I cried. I begged her to stop,
but she wouldn't.

03:59.774 --> 04:01.493
She's a monster.

04:08.253 --> 04:09.614
Excuse me.

04:17.694 --> 04:18.934
I got here as soon as I could.

04:19.014 --> 04:20.814
Now, I've isolated Spiteri.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.653
She's had to make a statement,
of course.

04:22.733 --> 04:24.574
What's going on, Mr Channing?

04:24.653 --> 04:28.334
Jodie Spiteri's making
serious allegations against you.

04:28.413 --> 04:31.853
She claims you used
physical and psychological abuse

04:31.934 --> 04:34.613
to force her to attack Bea Smith.
I see.

04:34.694 --> 04:37.173
Now, it's ridiculous, of course.
But... Yes.

04:37.254 --> 04:40.014
..she has taken the complaint
to the Ombudsman.

04:40.093 --> 04:41.574
You'll shut it down, yes?

04:41.653 --> 04:43.853
It's gone too far, Joan.

04:43.934 --> 04:46.134
Has to go to a hearing.

04:47.853 --> 04:49.653
Joan, trust me.

04:49.733 --> 04:54.694
I will do everything in my power
to make sure the truth comes out.

04:54.774 --> 04:57.093
So will I.
Good.

04:57.173 --> 05:01.973
In the meantime, it's probably best
to stay away from Spiteri.

05:02.053 --> 05:04.374
Why is Smith involved?
She's not a peer worker.

05:04.454 --> 05:06.454
She's her nominated advocate.

05:08.014 --> 05:11.093
All my resources
are at your disposal, hmm?

05:11.173 --> 05:12.334
Governor.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.774
Hello, beautiful.
Hello.

05:36.494 --> 05:37.853
How are ya?

05:37.934 --> 05:41.613
Good.
Hello, tiger.

05:41.694 --> 05:44.093
I love that you're convinced
we're having a boy.

05:44.173 --> 05:46.093
Yeah!
What if it's a she?

05:46.173 --> 05:49.774
Well, then it'll be, you know,
"Hello, lioness, or tigress."

05:49.853 --> 05:51.533
Whatever her name is.

05:51.613 --> 05:55.853
I don't care whatever it is,
'cause she, or he,

05:55.934 --> 05:57.173
is going to have you for a mum.

06:00.053 --> 06:01.254
Gosh, I've missed you.

06:01.334 --> 06:02.533
Me too.

06:03.653 --> 06:05.293
How are ya?
Oh, yeah.

06:05.374 --> 06:10.053
Well, fat, and bloated and fat.

06:10.134 --> 06:11.653
Don't be silly, Doreen.

06:13.134 --> 06:14.653
No, I'm serious.

06:14.733 --> 06:17.053
I mean, look at this thing.
I reckon they've got it wrong.

06:17.134 --> 06:19.254
There's got to be at least three
in there.

06:19.334 --> 06:20.973
The more the merrier, I say.

06:21.053 --> 06:25.853
I love you.
And I love you.

06:25.934 --> 06:29.494
You'd be so proud of me, Dor.
Yeah?

06:29.574 --> 06:31.533
Yeah. I can't wait for you
to see the house now.

06:31.613 --> 06:35.454
Bathroom's done, and I finally
finished painting bubby's room.

06:35.533 --> 06:37.613
Yeah, it looks bloody great.

06:37.694 --> 06:40.173
All it needs now is a woman's touch.

06:41.733 --> 06:43.454
Well, you'll be waiting a while.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.254
Hey, don't start that again, alright?
I told ya.

06:46.334 --> 06:51.533
12 months, you can apply for parole,
right? It'll fly, Dor.

06:51.613 --> 06:53.134
I promise.

06:53.213 --> 06:56.334
OK.
Isn't that right, tiger?

06:59.694 --> 07:04.894
Whoo!

07:06.533 --> 07:08.173
Whoo!

07:11.454 --> 07:12.494
Whoo!

07:15.733 --> 07:17.733
Doesn't anyone complain?

07:17.814 --> 07:19.973
Gotta let off steam somehow.

07:20.053 --> 07:22.894
Oi!
Soph! Get your arse over here. Now.

07:22.973 --> 07:24.774
Yeah! Come on, Soph!

07:24.853 --> 07:27.894
Go on.
Come on, you know you wanna!

07:32.814 --> 07:34.374
Shake it!

07:34.454 --> 07:35.973
Whoo!

07:39.494 --> 07:40.774
Go, Soph!

08:02.653 --> 08:05.374
Hey, Liz.
I'll leave you to it.

08:05.454 --> 08:07.894
Might want to get them
to keep that music down.

08:07.973 --> 08:11.733
Oh, shit. Turn it down, turn it
down. Hey, sorry, Bea. Sorry.

08:11.814 --> 08:13.853
I don't know...
No, turn it up, Boomer.

08:13.934 --> 08:16.694
Oh, cool. Turn it up!
Whoo-hoo!

08:16.774 --> 08:19.134
Turn it up. Turn it up!

08:20.173 --> 08:21.613
How'd she go?

08:21.694 --> 08:26.733
Good. Yeah, real good.
Hey, Jodie, you should be proud.

08:29.494 --> 08:31.293
You right?
I don't know.

08:31.374 --> 08:36.214
I don't think I can do this.
Yeah, you can do this, Jodie.

08:36.293 --> 08:38.573
No, you know what she's like.
I know. But it's our chance

08:38.653 --> 08:41.453
to take her down, thanks to you.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.614
We're all behind you.

08:44.573 --> 08:47.053
And don't forget, I'll be there
with you every step of the way, OK?

08:47.134 --> 08:49.134
You can do this, Jodie.
OK.

08:53.494 --> 08:55.813
How Spiteri thinks the ombudsman's
going to be believe this

08:55.894 --> 08:57.614
is anyone's guess. Oh, thank you.

09:00.494 --> 09:02.453
What do you make of her?

09:02.533 --> 09:06.333
Hmm, fragile.
Mmm, I agree.

09:06.413 --> 09:10.653
She's highly impressionable. I mean,
my fear is that she could be easily

09:10.734 --> 09:12.693
manipulated by the other women.

09:12.774 --> 09:15.134
What'd the board have to say?

09:15.214 --> 09:19.374
At the emergency meeting that
was apparently called last night?

09:19.453 --> 09:22.614
The Ombudsman informed
the board as a matter of courtesy.

09:22.693 --> 09:26.214
But not me.
That was out of my control.

09:26.293 --> 09:28.854
Hmm.
The preliminary hearing

09:28.933 --> 09:31.693
is set for tomorrow.

09:31.774 --> 09:34.533
Also out of your control.

09:34.614 --> 09:36.854
The chair was very concerned,
of course,

09:36.933 --> 09:40.254
but I managed to reassure him.
I'm sure you did.

09:40.333 --> 09:43.134
Joan, believe me,
I'm doing everything I can.

09:43.214 --> 09:44.374
Once Spiteri gives evidence,

09:44.453 --> 09:46.134
we'll know exactly
what we're dealing with.

09:46.173 --> 09:50.614
Allegations like this can leave
a bad smell, even when proven false.

09:50.693 --> 09:53.413
That's what makes this so unfair.

10:06.879 --> 10:08.165
You're not hungry?

10:08.245 --> 10:10.054
Not really.

10:13.633 --> 10:15.803
We got you a little treat.

10:15.885 --> 10:17.251
Thank you.

10:17.331 --> 10:20.267
But don't you eat it all at once.
And keep it away from Maxine.

10:40.085 --> 10:41.493
Ooh.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.311
Hi, love.

10:45.392 --> 10:47.161
Doreen.

10:47.241 --> 10:48.487
Hey.

10:48.568 --> 10:50.336
Liz.

10:50.418 --> 10:51.743
Oh, not 'Mum' anymore.

10:52.990 --> 10:54.036
You OK?

10:56.246 --> 10:57.734
Soph, I've been a bit worried
about you.

10:57.815 --> 10:58.981
Just...

11:12.608 --> 11:14.900
Listen to me, love...
No, I don't have to listen to you.

11:14.980 --> 11:17.995
Yes, you do. I've been here
for eight years and I'm your mum

11:18.076 --> 11:20.286
so you're gonna hear me out.
Just leave me alone.

11:20.367 --> 11:24.830
Love, I saw you in H2. You were
dancing around, you were really...

11:24.909 --> 11:26.599
Really what?

11:26.678 --> 11:28.568
You were really asking for it,
alright?

11:28.648 --> 11:30.658
Love, in here, that is dangerous.

11:30.740 --> 11:33.232
Shut up. Listen,
if you keep acting like that,

11:33.311 --> 11:36.568
pretty soon someone is gonna
take advantage of you...

11:36.649 --> 11:38.457
For fuck's sake. You are not my mum!

11:38.539 --> 11:43.482
My mum comes to visit me
with my dad and my little brother.

11:43.564 --> 11:46.618
You're just some... some old lag.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.715
Keep it down, Donaldson.
You're a lag, and an alcoholic.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.363
And you've fucked up
everything in your life

11:51.442 --> 11:52.648
and I don't want anything
you've ever touched...

11:52.730 --> 11:55.021
Hey, that's enough. That's enough.
No, it's OK. I can handle it.

11:55.102 --> 11:56.307
You sure?
Yes.

11:56.388 --> 11:58.839
Soph, please, will you...

12:02.257 --> 12:04.709
No, it's alright.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.638
Liz, it's gonna be alright.

12:06.719 --> 12:09.092
Yeah, it will.

12:10.418 --> 12:12.387
Love, you really wouldn't know.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.368
Well, at least you've got Doreen's
little one to look forward to.

12:16.449 --> 12:18.378
You know, you're so lucky.

12:21.233 --> 12:22.960
Liz.
Liz?

12:38.841 --> 12:41.373
Vera.
Oh, hi.

12:41.454 --> 12:43.825
Hi. I brought something for you.

12:45.595 --> 12:47.162
Yeah, I started cooking again.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.499
Yeah, thought you might like some.

12:50.578 --> 12:52.027
Oh...

12:52.106 --> 12:54.439
Oh, you've had lunch already?

12:54.519 --> 12:56.328
Ah, no,
I'm just... I'm not very hungry.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.016
Alright. Well, I'll...
Thank you.

12:58.096 --> 12:59.826
I can put it in here for later on,
yeah?

12:59.905 --> 13:01.675
Thanks.
Feeling better?

13:01.754 --> 13:04.810
Sorry?
Well, you said you had the flu.

13:04.890 --> 13:06.258
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

13:06.338 --> 13:08.469
Ah, I just...

13:08.549 --> 13:13.414
Being able to talk about things
has meant a lot to me,

13:13.494 --> 13:16.268
and I just wanted to say thank you.

13:17.916 --> 13:19.604
Come in, Sierra 3.

13:19.685 --> 13:21.373
Sorry.

13:21.454 --> 13:22.821
Ah, yes, Governor.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.056
Thank you, Ms Bennett.

13:30.137 --> 13:32.389
If you could wait outside.

13:38.419 --> 13:40.791
You never write, you never call.

13:40.871 --> 13:42.881
Spiteri and Smith. What do you know?

13:42.961 --> 13:44.006
I'm not going there anymore.

13:44.087 --> 13:45.294
Really?
Mmm.

13:45.373 --> 13:46.419
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

13:46.499 --> 13:47.865
We're done.

13:50.078 --> 13:54.298
I have a draft copy of my report
for your parole hearing.

13:54.378 --> 13:56.026
Would you care to have a read of it?

13:58.640 --> 14:01.293
I'm not up for parole yet.
Oh, you will be soon.

14:03.464 --> 14:05.676
It's... it's quite detailed.

14:05.756 --> 14:08.730
Complimentary, even.
Within reason, of course.

14:08.811 --> 14:11.102
Wow. Thanks.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.193
I mean, clearly my concern
is for Spiteri's wellbeing.

14:13.273 --> 14:16.088
She's exhibiting signs of stress
and as governor I need to be aware

14:16.167 --> 14:18.580
of all the prisoners' welfare needs.
How is she?

14:18.660 --> 14:20.268
Well, she was pretty fucked up.

14:20.349 --> 14:22.480
She's doing much better now.

14:22.559 --> 14:25.897
I do hope she's getting some support
from the, ah, other prisoners.

14:27.786 --> 14:28.872
Yeah.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.358
I wouldn't worry too much.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.701
A detailed application
to the Ombudsman

14:34.781 --> 14:37.635
takes some legal expertise.
Isn't that right?

14:43.224 --> 14:45.394
Detach Spiteri from Smith.

14:45.475 --> 14:48.570
Ensure Spiteri understands
that nothing good will come

14:48.650 --> 14:50.259
of this course of action.

14:51.626 --> 14:54.077
And then I'll sign this report.

15:09.028 --> 15:10.034
Oh!

15:10.113 --> 15:11.160
Nice.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.534
That is outstanding. Right.

15:13.615 --> 15:14.983
Are you sure I can't do anything?

15:15.064 --> 15:17.238
No. I am very sure.

15:18.204 --> 15:19.492
You take that.

15:19.571 --> 15:21.664
OK.
Bring your glass.

15:21.745 --> 15:23.476
Yes.
And your beautiful self...

15:25.850 --> 15:27.259
..and come out here.

15:33.175 --> 15:34.424
Alright.

15:34.503 --> 15:36.756
Right. Cheers.
Cheers.

15:39.413 --> 15:43.921
So, what do you think, mmm?
Guess it'll have to do.

15:44.003 --> 15:47.182
Is that right? Well, the food
had better be amazing,

15:47.262 --> 15:49.073
that's all I'm saying.
See, I think you're worried.

15:49.154 --> 15:52.776
I think you're worried you're not
gonna be able to control yourself.

15:52.856 --> 15:54.949
Oh, really?

15:55.029 --> 15:59.658
Ooh, kebabs.
I know. I've outdone myself.

16:05.414 --> 16:06.822
Where do you keep your firewood?

16:06.903 --> 16:09.318
In the back. But I can get it.

16:09.399 --> 16:11.008
I'll go.

16:11.088 --> 16:12.820
You focus on that awesome food.

16:12.899 --> 16:14.630
The torch is near the back door.

16:14.711 --> 16:15.959
OK. Thank you.

16:29.643 --> 16:31.856
Will? Will!
Yeah?

16:31.937 --> 16:34.352
Come out here!

16:34.433 --> 16:36.847
What's up?

16:41.356 --> 16:44.091
Is that blood?

16:44.172 --> 16:46.869
What is going on?

16:46.949 --> 16:48.358
Don't touch it.
What? Why not?

16:49.525 --> 16:50.935
Fuck it.

16:51.015 --> 16:53.267
You need to call the police.
What's it doing here?

16:53.348 --> 16:55.079
I don't know, OK?

16:56.166 --> 16:58.219
I think it's the murder weapon
the cops are looking for.

16:58.298 --> 17:00.391
Someone's planted it on me, alright?

17:00.473 --> 17:02.041
Someone's trying to frame me
for Harry's murder.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.812
Who?
I don't know!

17:03.893 --> 17:05.060
You have to go to the police.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.307
I can't.
Why not?

17:08.078 --> 17:09.045
Why not?

17:10.292 --> 17:12.627
I went around to Harry's place
after he ran us off the road

17:12.666 --> 17:14.560
and I smashed his van with that.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.940
I think you need to call the police.

17:18.021 --> 17:19.911
Will.

17:19.992 --> 17:22.246
You have to call the police, Will.

17:24.299 --> 17:25.346
What are you...

17:26.471 --> 17:27.438
What are you doing?

17:27.519 --> 17:28.766
You need to go home.

17:28.847 --> 17:30.496
Will, you can't...
Get out of here!

17:30.578 --> 17:32.389
Jesus!

18:29.045 --> 18:31.780
Expecting someone? What happened?

18:32.234 --> 18:34.928
Oh, they bailed.

18:38.545 --> 18:40.938
Help yourself, Detective.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.050
Don't mind if I do.

18:44.895 --> 18:45.900
Mmm.

18:48.069 --> 18:49.317
You a fan of the marinade?

18:49.365 --> 18:50.770
Yeah.
So am I.

18:50.853 --> 18:52.018
Yeah?

18:52.100 --> 18:54.551
You get that right, everything
else just falls into place.

18:54.702 --> 18:58.882
You want some rice with that?
No? Maybe some salad?

18:58.963 --> 19:00.973
Only when the wife's around.
Right.

19:01.053 --> 19:05.276
So, who was she? She who bailed?

19:06.925 --> 19:08.089
Just a mate.

19:08.170 --> 19:09.980
Some mate.

19:10.060 --> 19:11.789
I'd hate to see you try
and impress someone.

19:30.482 --> 19:32.210
Is that cardamom?

19:35.630 --> 19:37.598
Bloody love cardamom.

19:43.548 --> 19:44.835
So, now that you've tossed my place,

19:44.916 --> 19:46.563
is there anything else
you're looking for, Detective?

19:46.645 --> 19:48.735
We'll let you know when we find it.

19:56.132 --> 19:57.861
What else?

20:00.273 --> 20:03.008
Ginger.

20:07.698 --> 20:09.708
Sorry for the disturbance,
Mr Jackson.

20:09.790 --> 20:11.276
We'll leave you in peace now.

20:13.569 --> 20:15.980
What are you doing with my laptop?
Routine enquiries.

20:16.062 --> 20:17.990
Let you know when you can come
and pick it up.

20:18.071 --> 20:21.127
Oh, and, uh, thanks for the grub.

20:21.207 --> 20:23.819
Cardamom. Inspired.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.353
Oh, Jesus.

20:39.741 --> 20:43.278
Governor.

20:43.358 --> 20:45.087
Thank you, Ms Bennett.

20:51.038 --> 20:53.971
I was under the impression
that we had a working agreement.

20:54.052 --> 20:55.419
So was I.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.233
This hearing. Your idea?

20:59.802 --> 21:01.248
I'm just the prisoner's advocate.

21:06.596 --> 21:09.049
It's a high-risk strategy, Smith.

21:09.130 --> 21:11.822
I never took you for a gambler.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.114
Hmm, you were right about that.

21:14.194 --> 21:18.094
That's not how it appears.
You have no material evidence.

21:18.174 --> 21:20.627
Just the word of
an unstable prisoner

21:20.708 --> 21:22.236
against that of the governor.

21:22.315 --> 21:25.773
Well, I think that's a matter
for the Ombudsman, don't you?

21:27.743 --> 21:31.040
Spiteri knifed you. What makes you
think you can trust her now?

21:33.532 --> 21:35.903
You understand

21:35.984 --> 21:39.441
how vulnerable you're
leaving yourself if this fails.

21:42.577 --> 21:44.990
Was there anything else, Governor?

21:49.211 --> 21:50.618
Uh-uh.

21:50.697 --> 21:51.784
You may go.

22:09.916 --> 22:11.162
Come on.
Tongue left.

22:11.242 --> 22:14.499
Tongue right. You can go. Next.

22:14.579 --> 22:16.307
Healey, E.

22:18.397 --> 22:21.213
Hey. Look, we need to talk.

22:22.982 --> 22:24.348
Tongue left.
Rose.

22:24.428 --> 22:25.674
Tongue right.

22:25.756 --> 22:27.644
You can go.
Please.

22:27.726 --> 22:30.137
Next.
Henderson.

22:38.138 --> 22:40.670
Tongue left. Tongue right.

23:07.083 --> 23:10.179
Oi! You gonna let anyone else
have a go or what?

23:12.753 --> 23:14.118
Hey, Booms, Booms, Booms.

23:14.198 --> 23:15.286
What the fuck do you want?

23:18.020 --> 23:19.788
Oh.

23:19.868 --> 23:21.316
Yeah, I got a batch on the go now.

23:21.395 --> 23:23.085
Yeah, make ya spew.

23:23.164 --> 23:24.855
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.

23:24.933 --> 23:27.948
Tenner, right?
You'll have it this arvo.

23:28.030 --> 23:29.476
Last time it was five.

23:29.557 --> 23:32.371
Yeah, well, this is a shit-hot brew,
alright?

23:32.451 --> 23:34.423
Jesus, Booms.

23:34.502 --> 23:37.197
No, take it or leave it.
I don't care, alright, choose?

23:37.276 --> 23:38.442
I don't care.

23:40.855 --> 23:42.341
Attention compound.

23:42.423 --> 23:44.633
Work details are to commence
in five minutes.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.763
All prisoners are to report to
their work stations.

23:46.844 --> 23:47.930
G'day, Mr Jackson. How are you?

23:48.010 --> 23:49.578
Warner. Smith.

23:50.785 --> 23:52.232
Yeah?
Linda, I've got Smith.

23:52.311 --> 23:53.316
Smith, off you go.

24:03.368 --> 24:04.694
You were right.

24:04.776 --> 24:10.042
Karen Proctor and her mob
killed Harry.OK.

24:10.121 --> 24:12.212
No, but they're trying
to frame me for it.

24:12.293 --> 24:14.786
What?
They planted the wood splitter

24:14.866 --> 24:16.112
at my place.

24:16.192 --> 24:17.478
There was blood all over it.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.770
Why would they try to frame you?

24:19.851 --> 24:22.223
Well, I confronted Proctor
after she visited you.

24:22.304 --> 24:23.630
We had an argument.

24:23.710 --> 24:25.439
She must have freaked out.

24:25.520 --> 24:29.017
Last night, I came back to my place
and the splitter was at the back.

24:29.099 --> 24:30.786
OK? Then the cops turned up.

24:30.867 --> 24:32.997
Well, did you tell the cops?

24:33.077 --> 24:37.339
Well, no.
What about the splitter?

24:37.420 --> 24:38.385
Well, I destroyed it.

24:39.349 --> 24:42.043
Why would you do that?

24:44.856 --> 24:47.390
Jesus Christ, Bea, you don't think
I had anything to do with it.

24:50.084 --> 24:52.818
Come on.

25:05.321 --> 25:07.813
Nuh.
I don't wanna talk about myself.

25:07.894 --> 25:11.511
What's worrying you?
Nothing's worrying me.

25:11.593 --> 25:14.125
What have I got to complain about?

25:14.205 --> 25:17.623
I have the same conversation
with the same dickheads every day,

25:17.704 --> 25:21.321
and then at night, I can replay it
all over again in my head.

25:21.402 --> 25:23.251
Everything's fuckin' awesome.

25:23.331 --> 25:26.105
Well, I'm not surprised you feel
like that. Prison's a boring place,

25:26.185 --> 25:29.361
especially for a smart woman
like you.

25:30.970 --> 25:32.336
You think I'm smart, do ya?

25:32.418 --> 25:35.031
Course I do.
Great.

25:35.111 --> 25:38.609
So, let's talk about you.
Nice try.

25:38.690 --> 25:41.904
Can't blame me for trying.

25:41.986 --> 25:43.836
I'm surrounded by dickheads
and psychopaths.

25:43.915 --> 25:45.362
Psychopaths?

25:45.442 --> 25:47.934
Don't tell me you haven't checked
Ferguson off against the DSM.

25:47.975 --> 25:50.628
Sorry?
Jesus.

25:50.709 --> 25:53.886
The Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual.

25:53.966 --> 25:55.333
Yes, I know what the DSM is.

25:55.413 --> 25:57.745
I'm just not used to inmates
who quote from it.

25:57.826 --> 25:59.232
And that's my point.

26:01.123 --> 26:02.811
Inmates.
Mmm.

26:07.352 --> 26:09.246
We're not here
to talk about Ferguson, are we?

26:09.325 --> 26:10.896
No, we're not.

26:10.977 --> 26:13.232
Or about you.

26:13.312 --> 26:15.528
That's right.

26:17.340 --> 26:20.882
Or about why you're wearing
that new shade of lipstick today.

26:22.534 --> 26:24.065
It suits you, by the way.

26:25.555 --> 26:27.446
How does it taste?

26:30.224 --> 26:32.683
Franky...
Or about why you cross your legs

26:32.762 --> 26:34.210
when I come closer?

26:36.225 --> 26:39.165
Or about why you smile
when I walk in the room.

26:41.541 --> 26:43.475
And I know that smile.

26:46.212 --> 26:47.783
And I know what it means.

26:49.957 --> 26:51.488
Are you trying to threaten me?

26:51.568 --> 26:53.300
Why would you say that?

26:53.379 --> 26:56.359
Because you're trying to
intimidate me and I don't like it.

26:58.012 --> 26:59.702
I don't respect it.

27:09.205 --> 27:11.341
I'm bored, Gidget.

27:13.071 --> 27:15.650
I'm sick of everyone
and I'm sick of myself.

27:17.863 --> 27:19.234
I hate it here.

27:19.313 --> 27:21.125
I know.

27:31.079 --> 27:33.130
I told you, I didn't take it.
Yeah, well, then who did, huh?

27:33.210 --> 27:34.694
Who? Who?
I don't know!

27:34.774 --> 27:35.939
No, I filled that container.

27:36.018 --> 27:37.986
It was almost to the top!
Hey! Hey! What's going on here?

27:38.065 --> 27:40.154
Oh, the dumb bitch reckons
I stole her grog.

27:40.234 --> 27:41.799
Yeah.
You're too tight to pay for it.

27:41.879 --> 27:43.326
I didn't fuckin' steal it!

27:43.406 --> 27:45.293
If I find out that you had
anything to do with this,

27:45.372 --> 27:47.782
I will go bunta on your arse!

27:47.861 --> 27:50.511
Stop it!
No-one's going bunta, alright?

27:50.591 --> 27:53.241
And when you find out who took it,
you come to me first, alright?

27:53.321 --> 27:56.253
Yeah? And you, go clean your teeth.
Your breath stinks.

27:57.697 --> 27:59.422
Soph! Soph?

27:59.504 --> 28:00.789
Fuck off and leave me alone.

28:00.869 --> 28:04.602
Hey, Sophie.
No, no, Bea, it's fine.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.290
No, no, I just want to have a word.

28:06.369 --> 28:08.696
Come on, let's take a walk.
I want to have a word with you.

28:10.223 --> 28:11.267
Oh, what?

28:50.608 --> 28:51.733
Oh, yeah!

28:58.156 --> 28:59.120
Thanks.

29:00.604 --> 29:01.971
You know, Sophie,

29:02.052 --> 29:03.697
when I first came in here,
I was scared shitless, too.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.623
I was a mess.

29:05.704 --> 29:08.152
Your mum,
she was a peer worker then.

29:08.234 --> 29:10.241
She was the one
who got me through it.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.926
Franky said Mum lagged on her.

29:12.007 --> 29:14.054
Yeah, she did.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.903
Well, isn't that the worst?

29:16.983 --> 29:18.591
Well, that all depends.

29:18.669 --> 29:21.401
You know, things were pretty bad
in here, Sophie.

29:21.481 --> 29:23.609
Some women died.

29:23.688 --> 29:27.181
Your mum,
she was just looking out for us.

29:31.879 --> 29:33.765
I know it couldn't have been easy
for you and your brother

29:33.845 --> 29:36.214
with your mum's drinking,
but your mum, she's different now.

29:40.630 --> 29:43.520
Did she really talk about me?
No.

29:43.600 --> 29:47.375
But I think she did the right thing.
How's that right?

29:47.455 --> 29:48.979
My daughter, Debbie,

29:49.058 --> 29:51.990
she died because someone inhere
found out who she was.

29:52.070 --> 29:54.559
I don't think your mum wanted
to take that risk with you.

29:54.641 --> 29:56.689
Wish I'd done the same thing.

30:03.473 --> 30:05.521
I know it's tough on you both.

30:08.209 --> 30:10.057
But you need to give your mum
a chance.

30:10.136 --> 30:12.706
You hear me?

30:14.913 --> 30:18.247
Because she's one of the best things
about this place.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.174
So you be good to her.

30:52.033 --> 30:56.128
Ms Spiteri,
these are very serious allegations.

30:56.207 --> 30:58.337
Yep, I understand.

30:58.415 --> 30:59.621
Pick it up, Jodes.

30:59.701 --> 31:03.756
Um... All I... all I want
is the chance to be heard.

31:05.603 --> 31:07.048
And the abuse?

31:07.127 --> 31:08.574
Oh, right, right.

31:08.654 --> 31:09.696
And to make sure

31:09.777 --> 31:11.584
that abuse like I was subjected to

31:11.664 --> 31:14.755
doesn't happen again, to anyone.
Admit it.

31:14.837 --> 31:16.442
You're just trying to slander
the governor.

31:16.521 --> 31:17.726
This isn't about the governor.

31:17.766 --> 31:19.493
This is about my rights
as a prisoner.

31:19.573 --> 31:22.664
Tou-fuckin'-Che. Nice one, Jodes.
Why do you expect us to believe you,

31:22.743 --> 31:25.272
Ms Spiteri.
Uh...

31:25.353 --> 31:28.646
Why? Why, Ms Spiteri?
I don't know.

31:28.725 --> 31:30.291
Come on, Jodes!
Look at your record.

31:30.373 --> 31:32.419
Dishonesty, fraud, drug use.

31:35.550 --> 31:38.162
Why should we believe you?
Hit back at her.

31:38.241 --> 31:41.010
Because whatever my past crimes,

31:41.089 --> 31:43.298
what happened to me in Wentworth
was wrong.

31:47.393 --> 31:49.964
No-one should have to suffer abuse
like I did.

31:50.042 --> 31:53.615
And that's why
I've made this complaint. Bam.

31:53.696 --> 31:55.704
Is that OK?
Yeah, it was alright.

31:55.784 --> 31:58.313
That was better than alright.
Good, love.

31:58.392 --> 32:01.244
OK, you just gotta stick with what
you just said, and remember,

32:01.325 --> 32:02.647
I'll be there with you
the whole time.OK.

32:02.729 --> 32:04.374
Work detail's about to
commence in five minutes...

32:04.453 --> 32:06.381
These guys'll stay here with you
and I'll see you at the hearing,

32:06.462 --> 32:07.908
alright?
Alright.

32:08.470 --> 32:10.076
Hey, Bea? Thanks.

32:12.925 --> 32:15.615
OK?

32:15.696 --> 32:18.385
OK. Let's go again.

32:57.929 --> 32:59.736
Things have been pretty shitty
lately, yeah?

33:00.780 --> 33:01.944
Yeah.

33:05.436 --> 33:07.243
It's a shame.

33:09.532 --> 33:12.543
I don't know. Do you think, you
know, when things get a bit better

33:12.621 --> 33:14.870
and settle down
that maybe you and I...

33:17.279 --> 33:19.085
I'm not the kind of girl
you should be hanging out with.

33:19.164 --> 33:22.016
Franky. It wasn't just hanging out.

33:23.623 --> 33:25.107
I know.

33:29.524 --> 33:30.889
This thing you're doing today,

33:30.967 --> 33:33.337
you've really got the chance
to stick it up Ferguson.

33:33.417 --> 33:38.074
You bring that bitch down
for all of us. OK?

33:38.154 --> 33:39.359
OK.

33:39.439 --> 33:43.212
Spiteri.
You're needed at the hearing.

33:46.464 --> 33:51.363
You're alright.
Thanks.

33:53.530 --> 33:56.421
Hey, Bea's got your back.

34:14.036 --> 34:18.373
Mum? Mum.

34:18.455 --> 34:21.103
Oh, love, it's you.

34:22.168 --> 34:24.858
Bea told me about some things
and I wanted to come and...

34:24.860 --> 34:30.518
Oh, darling. Oh, Soph, I have
missed you so much, my darling.

34:30.597 --> 34:32.806
Are you drunk? You're drunk!

34:32.886 --> 34:33.850
I'm not drunk, Sophie.

34:33.931 --> 34:35.496
Oh, my god.
I'm not drunk!

34:35.574 --> 34:37.303
Sophie, I'm not drunk!

34:37.384 --> 34:40.753
Sophie! I'm not drunk! Soph!
Hey, what's up? You right?

34:40.835 --> 34:42.440
She's drunk!
Sophie!

34:42.520 --> 34:44.850
Soph. Oh, fuck, no, no, no!

34:44.929 --> 34:45.893
Did she do anything to you?

34:45.974 --> 34:48.222
Get out. Go, go, go. Liz.

34:48.302 --> 34:49.947
You, you leave her alone.

34:50.029 --> 34:51.434
What's going on, Franky?
Liz is pissed.

34:51.514 --> 34:52.478
She's getting punchy again.

34:52.558 --> 34:53.802
Shut that mouth.

34:53.882 --> 34:55.166
You shut it!
You make me!

34:55.246 --> 34:56.210
Liz!
What, me?

34:56.290 --> 34:57.537
What, you gonna make me, are ya?
Yeah.

34:57.616 --> 34:59.702
You're disgusting. Look at you.
Who are you, ya friggin' pip squeak?

34:59.783 --> 35:01.110
You better go. You better go.
Yeah, I am...

35:01.188 --> 35:02.271
No, I haven't finished with you,
love.

35:02.352 --> 35:03.638
Liz, stop!
Liz, let me go.

35:03.718 --> 35:05.565
You need to let go of me. Now.
Stop it!

35:05.644 --> 35:09.377
You leave her alone!
Love your work, Liz.

35:09.459 --> 35:11.587
Look at what you did!
You shut your mouth,

35:11.666 --> 35:14.235
and you fuckin' leave my daughter
alone. Get out of the way.

35:14.316 --> 35:16.885
Or what?
What are you fuckin' gonna do to me?

35:16.966 --> 35:18.973
I'm warning you.
Ooh, you're warning me.

35:19.056 --> 35:22.065
Are ya gonna shiv me
the same way ya fuckin' shivved...

35:22.145 --> 35:24.753
Shut your mouth. I will kill you.

35:24.834 --> 35:26.359
I will fucking kill you!

35:26.440 --> 35:27.645
Franky, let her go.

35:33.226 --> 35:36.274
You right, Liz?
Fuck off.

35:36.354 --> 35:38.845
Get back to your unit. Sleep it off.
We'll talk in the morning.

35:46.192 --> 35:48.239
Disappointed, Franky.

35:49.883 --> 35:51.651
Professionally and personally.

35:51.732 --> 35:53.780
Like I give a fuck.

35:53.859 --> 35:57.233
Ms Westfall, is there trouble?
No trouble.

35:57.312 --> 35:59.479
We're done.

36:01.648 --> 36:03.091
Good. You're wanted at the hearing.

36:11.933 --> 36:14.645
Ms Spiteri.
Thank you for joining us.

36:17.318 --> 36:18.833
Where's Bea?

36:18.913 --> 36:20.229
Well, Bea should be here.

36:20.309 --> 36:22.583
Bea Smith, the prisoner's advocate.

36:24.058 --> 36:27.409
Where is she?
Ms Bennett will go and find her.

36:44.362 --> 36:47.873
I would like to thank the office of
the Ombudsman for this opportunity

36:47.953 --> 36:50.945
to air this complaint.
Noted, Ms Ferguson.

36:53.097 --> 36:54.174
Shall we begin?

36:56.051 --> 36:57.886
Um... uh...

37:01.115 --> 37:02.154
What happened?

37:03.869 --> 37:05.705
She, um...

37:07.301 --> 37:11.607
She came while I was in the slot
and...

37:11.688 --> 37:13.482
"She" being Ms Ferguson?

37:17.751 --> 37:20.543
Ms Spiteri?
Uh, yes.

37:20.622 --> 37:22.496
What happened?

37:22.576 --> 37:26.686
She... she... she took me to another
place. I don't know where.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.681
Can you describe it?

37:28.759 --> 37:31.551
Well, no, I'd never been there
before. It was dark.

37:31.633 --> 37:33.067
I dunno.

37:35.182 --> 37:41.087
Uh... she drugged me,

37:41.167 --> 37:44.955
she hurt me, she made me say things.

37:45.033 --> 37:51.218
What things did she make you say?
Uh... that um...

37:52.295 --> 37:55.127
You're worthless.
That I'm worthless.

37:55.208 --> 37:56.842
You're pointless.

37:56.921 --> 37:58.717
And I'm pointless.
You're nothing.

37:58.797 --> 37:59.874
And I'm nothing.

38:01.749 --> 38:03.424
And that no-one misses me.

38:04.819 --> 38:07.851
And that I'm... I'm worthless.

38:07.932 --> 38:10.605
You're worthless.
That I'm pointless.

38:10.685 --> 38:12.598
You're pointless.
And I'm nothing.

38:13.755 --> 38:16.428
And that no-one misses me,
and no-one cares.

38:16.509 --> 38:17.902
Ms Spiteri.

38:20.816 --> 38:22.971
Ms Spiteri.
I want Bea!

38:24.246 --> 38:27.237
I want Bea! I want Bea!

38:27.318 --> 38:28.555
If I may.

38:28.634 --> 38:30.428
Where is she?
May... may I?

38:30.509 --> 38:33.542
I'm just... I am concerned
for the prisoner's mental state.

38:33.621 --> 38:34.857
Perhaps a 5-minute break?

38:35.934 --> 38:37.290
Good idea, Ms Ferguson.

38:43.075 --> 38:44.153
Thank you.

38:44.231 --> 38:45.948
Can we talk now, please?

38:46.028 --> 38:48.219
No.
Come on, Rose.

38:49.417 --> 38:50.894
I'm not gonna do this anymore.

38:50.973 --> 38:55.359
I'll talk to you at work. We can be
polite, but that's about it.

38:55.441 --> 38:57.314
Look, I don't know what's going on,
OK?

38:57.397 --> 38:59.070
Neither do I.

38:59.148 --> 39:01.942
But I don't want anything more
to do with you, OK? So...

39:12.075 --> 39:13.391
Sierra 6 to Sierra 4,

39:13.471 --> 39:14.907
we need your assistance in the yard.

39:22.246 --> 39:25.278
Jodie Spiteri engaged in
a number of self-harming behaviours.

39:25.359 --> 39:26.954
However, we have been
working together

39:27.033 --> 39:29.866
to find strategies
to deal with them.

39:29.946 --> 39:31.820
What were these strategies,
Ms Westfall?

39:31.900 --> 39:33.654
Cognitive behaviour therapy,

39:33.734 --> 39:35.808
analysis of past patterns
of behaviour,

39:35.890 --> 39:37.764
identification of future goals.

39:37.844 --> 39:39.997
I believe
we're making good progress.

39:40.076 --> 39:42.669
However, I would be worried
to place Jodie

39:42.749 --> 39:45.421
under too much emotional pressure
as these strategies...

39:45.501 --> 39:48.453
Excuse me.

39:48.535 --> 39:51.484
May I...?

39:57.549 --> 40:00.379
Ms Smith has been placed
in the psychiatric ward...

40:05.047 --> 40:07.041
Uh, my apologies,

40:07.122 --> 40:11.070
but prisoner advocate Smith
will not be able to take part

40:11.150 --> 40:12.107
in this hearing.

40:12.188 --> 40:17.733
She's, uh, incapacitated.

40:25.589 --> 40:26.708
Oh, Jodie.

40:28.900 --> 40:32.450
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:32.532 --> 40:35.763
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

40:37.798 --> 40:39.552
I am sorry!

40:46.453 --> 40:48.169
I'm sorry.

40:54.293 --> 40:56.327
You're nothing.

40:56.407 --> 40:57.483
No-one misses you.

40:57.648 --> 40:59.284
No-one cares.

40:59.363 --> 41:01.956
Ms Spiteri will receive
appropriate care?

41:02.035 --> 41:03.792
I'll make sure she does.
Good.

41:03.974 --> 41:06.592
Thank you, Ms Westfall.
Thank you, Mr Henderson.

41:06.593 --> 41:08.550
Thank you.
Bye.

41:10.464 --> 41:12.299
So, withdrawal of all allegations.

41:12.380 --> 41:14.253
The board will be pleased.

41:15.290 --> 41:17.525
You seem surprised, Mr Channing.

41:17.604 --> 41:19.239
Nothing surprises me, Joan.

41:19.321 --> 41:22.191
May I offer you my congratulations?

41:23.348 --> 41:25.822
You may. Was there anything else?

41:27.935 --> 41:29.412
Not that I can think of.

41:40.781 --> 41:42.136
Vera.
Mr Channing.

41:44.729 --> 41:45.927
Everything alright?

41:48.879 --> 41:50.713
During the riot,

41:50.793 --> 41:53.944
when I was held hostage...

41:55.939 --> 41:58.702
..did the governor refuse to open
the doors to isolation?

42:03.123 --> 42:05.000
Yes.

42:05.078 --> 42:06.752
She did.

42:10.782 --> 42:15.648
I had a syringe at my throat
and she refused?

42:19.985 --> 42:20.983
Thank you, sir.

42:23.574 --> 42:25.012
Vera, you OK?

42:26.808 --> 42:28.801
No.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.836
No, sir, I'm not.

42:45.673 --> 42:46.631
Hey, mate.

42:48.267 --> 42:49.784
You dropped your keys.

43:00.993 --> 43:02.387
Thanks.

43:07.375 --> 43:08.811
You alright there, mate?

43:11.123 --> 43:14.755
Yeah. Yeah. No worries.
