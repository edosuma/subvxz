00:18.971 --> 00:20.871
It's alive!

00:54.173 --> 00:55.470
Sent from planet Krypton

00:55.541 --> 00:57.600
to aid Superman
in the fight for justice,

00:57.676 --> 01:00.008
these are the Superpets...

01:00.079 --> 01:02.513
Krypto the Superdog...

01:04.917 --> 01:06.942
Streaky the Supercat...

01:10.089 --> 01:12.353
...Beppo the Supermonkey...

01:13.659 --> 01:16.093
...Comet the Superhorse...

01:16.161 --> 01:17.560
Aah!

01:17.630 --> 01:19.860
...Hissy the Supersnake.

01:19.932 --> 01:21.923
They are the...

01:24.903 --> 01:26.393
After a whole month in space,

01:26.472 --> 01:28.997
I can't wait to hug those
loveable Superpets.

01:30.576 --> 01:31.941
The Superpets!

01:32.011 --> 01:33.205
No!

01:33.279 --> 01:34.906
Ohh!

01:34.980 --> 01:36.470
Hello?

01:36.548 --> 01:37.640
Becky, this is S...

01:37.716 --> 01:39.445
We... well, is she there?

01:39.518 --> 01:40.348
One second.

01:40.419 --> 01:41.750
Hello, Becky?
Superman here.

01:41.820 --> 01:42.650
Did you, uh...

01:43.789 --> 01:44.983
No! No, Becky!

01:45.057 --> 01:46.285
Not next month!

01:46.358 --> 01:48.189
<i>You were supposed
to watch them this month!</i>

01:48.260 --> 01:50.251
<i>This month, Becky!</i>

01:50.896 --> 01:52.090
I'm so sorry.

01:52.164 --> 01:53.222
We just couldn't
reduce his fever

01:53.299 --> 01:55.233
for the flavor of a Pringles.

01:58.537 --> 02:00.334
We can't take much
more of this!

02:00.406 --> 02:01.668
Send out the call,
Ensign.

02:01.740 --> 02:03.230
We need Voltron!

02:03.309 --> 02:04.469
Right away, Commander.

02:04.543 --> 02:06.704
Together:
Voltron force, go!

02:22.561 --> 02:23.892
We're being ripped apart!

02:23.962 --> 02:25.395
Don't you worry,
Commander.

02:25.464 --> 02:26.795
That Robeast will be singing

02:26.865 --> 02:28.992
a different tune
once Voltron gets here.

02:44.016 --> 02:45.506
Where the hell is Voltron?!

02:45.584 --> 02:46.812
Don't you worry, sir.

02:46.885 --> 02:48.876
Voltron won't let us down.

02:59.531 --> 03:00.520
Wait a minute, guys.

03:00.599 --> 03:01.657
Something's not right.

03:01.734 --> 03:04.134
Let's take it back to step six.

03:20.252 --> 03:22.447
Is that Voltron?

03:22.521 --> 03:24.648
Yes, son.
He's right here.

03:24.723 --> 03:26.486
It's all gonna be okay.

03:30.863 --> 03:32.353
Voltron's on the scene!

03:32.431 --> 03:33.830
Voltron?!

03:33.899 --> 03:36.060
Where...
Where were you?!

03:36.135 --> 03:38.069
We got here at the speed
of justice!

03:38.137 --> 03:39.900
Not even the real Voltron.

03:39.972 --> 03:42.338
It's just that stupid
vehicle one.

03:44.676 --> 03:47.372
Voltron!

03:47.446 --> 03:50.142
<i>Congratulations,
Dr. Pepper.</i>

03:51.984 --> 03:55.181
My god... a planet where apes
evolved from men?

03:55.254 --> 03:56.221
Ape.

03:56.288 --> 03:58.483
What the fuck did you
just say to me?

03:58.557 --> 03:59.683
You said "apes," plural.

03:59.758 --> 04:01.225
There's only one ape... me.

04:01.293 --> 04:03.284
It kind of sucks, but, hey,
I'm glad you're here, man.

04:03.362 --> 04:04.226
We can play parcheesi.

04:04.296 --> 04:06.787
Ohh!
You maniacs!

04:06.865 --> 04:08.492
You blew it up!

04:08.567 --> 04:09.625
Me personally?

04:09.701 --> 04:11.293
No. No, no, no.

04:11.370 --> 04:12.667
I think there were
some other apes,

04:12.738 --> 04:15.605
<i>but they left on a spaceship
like forever ago.</i>

04:16.708 --> 04:17.935
I'm a little fuzzy
on the history.

04:18.010 --> 04:20.035
Ohh, damn you!

04:20.112 --> 04:21.409
Damn you all to hell!

04:21.480 --> 04:22.742
Hey!

04:22.815 --> 04:24.112
Yeah! There you go!

04:24.183 --> 04:25.775
That's the spirit!

04:25.851 --> 04:27.819
Anyway, I'm gonna go get
a smoothie.

04:27.886 --> 04:28.978
You want one?

04:30.289 --> 04:32.985
Yes, I'd like that very much,
new friend.

04:33.926 --> 04:34.824
Hmm?

04:44.670 --> 04:45.500
Oh, I found it.

04:45.571 --> 04:47.562
This is the problem right here.

05:41.126 --> 05:42.218
Wait, wait,
stop the execution!

05:42.294 --> 05:43.625
The Governor called!

05:43.695 --> 05:44.957
Oh, that's me... always a day
late and dollar short!

05:45.030 --> 05:47.089
That's the way it goes,
but how to feed the family?

05:47.165 --> 05:50.191
Time pilots, Carmen has
stolen the Brooklyn Bridge.

05:50.269 --> 05:52.669
We need you to head to
the year it was built

05:52.738 --> 05:54.399
and bring back that
bridge.

05:54.473 --> 05:55.633
You heard her, kids.

05:55.707 --> 05:57.538
We've got to retrieve
the Brooklyn Bridge.

05:59.645 --> 06:01.670
Uh, I got to take this.

06:01.747 --> 06:02.679
Janine, I'm doing the show.

06:02.748 --> 06:04.045
I told you we'd talk
about it later.

06:04.116 --> 06:05.310
I don't want to talk
about it later.

06:05.350 --> 06:06.180
Well, I have more to say.

06:06.251 --> 06:07.081
No, now.

06:07.152 --> 06:08.244
No, not now.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.753
What the fuck
you want me to lose my job?

06:09.821 --> 06:10.651
I don't care.

06:10.722 --> 06:11.552
Oh, nice.

06:11.623 --> 06:13.284
He's there now, isn't he?

06:13.358 --> 06:15.792
You mother fucking whore!

06:15.861 --> 06:17.590
Well, then I want
my jacket back!

06:17.663 --> 06:18.493
No way.

06:18.564 --> 06:20.122
Yes, way!
It's my fucking jacket!

06:20.198 --> 06:21.460
It was a gift!

06:21.533 --> 06:23.899
No, a gift is something you
give someone you love,

06:23.969 --> 06:24.936
you dumb bitch!

06:25.003 --> 06:26.732
Uh, hey, kids.

06:26.805 --> 06:30.571
Uh, that was the chief again,
and she said she made a mistake.

06:30.642 --> 06:33.110
Carmen didn't steal the
Brooklyn Bridge after all.

06:33.178 --> 06:35.703
She actually stole a magical
leather jacket,

06:35.781 --> 06:37.749
and we need your
help to get it back.

06:37.816 --> 06:38.748
So, are you with me?

06:38.817 --> 06:39.647
What's so mag...

06:39.718 --> 06:40.776
And we're off!

06:40.852 --> 06:42.479
Aren't we supposed to be
answering questions?

06:42.554 --> 06:43.646
I'll give you a question...

06:43.722 --> 06:45.622
What year did
that fucking bitch ruin my life?

06:45.691 --> 06:47.625
Don't know?
Trick question!

06:47.693 --> 06:49.661
She ruined three
fucking years of my life!

06:49.728 --> 06:50.854
Is this Franklin Street?

06:50.929 --> 06:52.863
You whore!

06:52.931 --> 06:54.592
I loved you!

06:54.666 --> 06:56.327
And you fucked it all up.

06:56.401 --> 06:59.859
I gave this to you because it
meant something, stupid.

06:59.938 --> 07:02.532
That was the day you
said you loved me.

07:02.608 --> 07:04.166
What was that day, kids?

07:04.242 --> 07:05.368
Together:
November 8th.

07:05.444 --> 07:07.344
November fucking 8th.

07:07.412 --> 07:09.403
3 points for you, kids.

07:30.268 --> 07:33.260
When did firemen
first start using poles, Susan?

07:33.338 --> 07:34.168
1878.

07:34.239 --> 07:36.434
Bingo!

07:36.508 --> 07:37.770
Hooray!

07:37.843 --> 07:38.741
Carmen is safe.

07:38.810 --> 07:39.742
Where are...

07:39.811 --> 07:41.108
I ask the questions!

07:45.450 --> 07:48.351
I-I-I-I swear it happened
in battle.

07:48.420 --> 07:49.250
Hi!
What's up?

07:49.321 --> 07:50.583
Konnichiwa! Bienvenu!

07:50.656 --> 07:52.715
I'm entrepreneur and alleged
rapist Joe Francis.

07:52.791 --> 07:54.122
When I started
"Girls Gone Wild,"

07:54.192 --> 07:57.355
I had no idea that 10 years of
semi-consensual orgies

07:57.429 --> 07:59.021
would leave me so desensitized.

07:59.097 --> 08:00.621
But look...
don't feel a thing!

08:00.699 --> 08:02.257
Anyway, my quest
to achieve an erection

08:02.334 --> 08:03.961
led me to some dark territory,

08:04.036 --> 08:06.300
and now you can come
along for the ride.

08:06.371 --> 08:07.804
Ohh ho ho!

08:07.873 --> 08:08.965
Hurts so good!

08:09.041 --> 08:11.771
We have such sights
to show you.

08:11.843 --> 08:14.607
And the "Girls Gone Wild"
cameras catch it all.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.740
You won't believe how far these
girls are willing to go.

08:17.816 --> 08:18.783
You're 18, right?

08:18.850 --> 08:19.680
Yeah, sure!

08:19.751 --> 08:21.378
Whoo!

08:21.453 --> 08:22.852
I want to be popular!

08:22.921 --> 08:26.550
The Cenobites have used up every
cheap thrill on hell and Earth,

08:26.625 --> 08:28.991
but they've never
done anything like this.

08:29.061 --> 08:30.585
Jealous?
Order now!

08:36.467 --> 08:38.231
Hyah!

08:38.303 --> 08:40.464
Rah!

08:40.539 --> 08:42.336
Drac,
where the hell have you been?

08:42.407 --> 08:43.374
Half the day is gone!

08:43.442 --> 08:45.433
Ugh, I was on a stakeout.

08:47.813 --> 08:49.178
Well, we've got a situation.

08:49.247 --> 08:50.714
Terrorists have called
in a threat,

08:50.782 --> 08:52.306
but our suspect's
not talking.

08:52.384 --> 08:53.578
Leave me alone with him.

08:53.652 --> 08:55.483
I'll find out what he knows.

08:55.554 --> 08:57.112
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
L-Listen. Listen.

08:57.189 --> 08:58.451
I've changed my mind.

08:58.523 --> 08:59.888
I'll tell you about the
terrorists and their bomb plot.

08:59.958 --> 09:00.890
I'll tell you everything.

09:00.959 --> 09:02.324
It's a little late for that.

09:02.394 --> 09:03.383
Wait. Wait. Wait.

09:03.462 --> 09:04.690
B-But i've decided to...

09:07.232 --> 09:08.062
He wouldn't talk.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.122
Damn it, Drac!

09:09.201 --> 09:10.668
Well, we've still
got three more suspects.

09:10.736 --> 09:11.998
Can I get you something to eat?

09:12.070 --> 09:14.163
No, I'm on a liquid diet.

09:18.944 --> 09:20.673
I said yes!
Yes, I'll tell you!

09:20.746 --> 09:21.644
Aah!

09:25.350 --> 09:27.250
The bomb's on flight 421!

09:27.319 --> 09:29.514
But, Drac,
it's already in the air!

09:29.588 --> 09:30.680
Nobody move!

09:30.756 --> 09:32.747
We've got a bomb!

09:39.264 --> 09:41.255
Whoa!

09:48.673 --> 09:50.470
What in the... huh?!

09:51.576 --> 09:52.804
Excuse me, sir.

09:52.878 --> 09:55.073
You're gonna have to return to
your se... ohh!

09:56.081 --> 09:57.139
What?

09:57.215 --> 09:58.512
Drac, the hijacker's
in the cockpit.

09:58.583 --> 09:59.982
The bomb's gonna blow in the
next five minutes

10:00.051 --> 10:01.609
if we don't meet his demands!

10:01.686 --> 10:03.551
Everybody down!
Get down!

10:06.458 --> 10:07.720
Where's the bomb?

10:07.793 --> 10:09.454
Bite me.

10:11.563 --> 10:12.552
Where's the bomb?!

10:12.631 --> 10:14.030
You'll know when you're dead.

10:14.099 --> 10:15.828
I am dead.

10:15.901 --> 10:17.892
Aah!

10:25.243 --> 10:26.073
Throw it!

10:26.144 --> 10:27.008
Wait for it.

10:27.078 --> 10:28.204
But it's a bomb!

10:28.280 --> 10:29.338
Wait for it.

10:29.414 --> 10:42.355
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

10:42.427 --> 10:43.485
And now!

10:44.796 --> 10:46.161
Eh? What is that?

10:46.231 --> 10:47.994
Is that a...

10:49.201 --> 10:50.031
Yeah?

10:50.101 --> 10:50.999
How'd it go, Drac?

10:51.069 --> 10:52.297
Well, I took care
of the bomb,

10:52.370 --> 10:54.565
but i'm afraid all the
passengers are dead.

10:54.639 --> 10:56.630
But we're not dead.
