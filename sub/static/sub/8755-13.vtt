WEBVTT

00:10.612 --> 00:13.952
There's a lot of people running
around in here, like, mad.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.750
We've had people run
out of here screaming.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.853
I think they might feel trapped
and like they can't breathe.

00:20.955 --> 00:24.190
I've seen an apparition
of a little girl.

00:24.292 --> 00:27.493
All these dead people, they're
feeding off of living energy.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.528
This whole area is a battlefield.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.729
What's going on?

00:30.832 --> 00:33.999
I felt like he was
gonna choke me to death.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.702
This guy, he's not good.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.104
There's a dark presence.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.173
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.442
These things, they're freaking out.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.643
They're from hell.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.678
I see dead people.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.112
They were being hunted.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.747
I speak to dead people.

00:48.850 --> 00:51.784
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.185
And they speak to me.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.553
Her neck got broken.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.556
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.458
I hear a gunshot.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.323
- I rely on my partner.
- I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.423 --> 01:04.557
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.659 --> 01:05.691
Something's not right here.

01:05.793 --> 01:09.228
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.764
It's not safe here. It's
my job to reveal them.

01:11.866 --> 01:13.232
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:13.334 --> 01:14.633
They're all buried here.

01:14.735 --> 01:16.502
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.604 --> 01:18.537
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.639 --> 01:21.140
Until the very end...
I can't do it no more.

01:21.242 --> 01:23.475
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.578 --> 01:25.010
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

01:25.112 --> 01:26.445
Or time to get out.

01:26.547 --> 01:28.180
It does not have a happy ending.

01:28.282 --> 01:31.016
Something kills people here.

01:47.435 --> 01:51.303
I'm in Waipahu, Hawaii,
just northwest of Honolulu.

01:51.405 --> 01:52.872
I got a call from a guy named Jeff,

01:52.974 --> 01:54.974
who says he's got trouble in paradise.

01:55.076 --> 01:58.410
Now, he runs a museum on
an old sugar plantation.

01:58.512 --> 01:59.979
But business was so slow,

02:00.081 --> 02:02.715
he agreed to open up a
haunted house attraction.

02:02.817 --> 02:04.783
Since then, all hell's broken loose.

02:04.886 --> 02:07.820
He says, if we can't find a solution,

02:07.922 --> 02:09.388
he's gonna have to shut the place down

02:09.490 --> 02:12.494
before somebody gets seriously hurt.

02:16.063 --> 02:19.462
This is a museum with
more than a dozen buildings.

02:20.468 --> 02:23.802
I've got to clear all of them
of any artwork, photographs

02:23.905 --> 02:24.970
or religious symbols

02:25.072 --> 02:27.575
so Amy is not influenced
by anything she sees.

02:29.477 --> 02:32.305
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:43.024 --> 02:46.825
I'm feeling a lot of stress here.

02:46.928 --> 02:51.463
It feels like these dead
people are very stressed out.

02:51.565 --> 02:55.467
I'm seeing, like, a
tall, glass enclosure.

02:55.569 --> 02:58.437
And all these dead people were in it.

02:58.539 --> 03:02.508
It said, "Do not let them
out. They are my pets."

03:02.610 --> 03:04.243
Then, I hear,

03:04.345 --> 03:09.715
"The earth here is as
alive as a human, more so.

03:09.817 --> 03:11.984
Listen to its heartbeat."

03:12.086 --> 03:15.921
And then, I hear, "The earth
has been asleep for 1,000 years,

03:16.023 --> 03:18.223
and it's waking up."

03:27.035 --> 03:30.903
Hey, Jeff. This place is amazing.

03:31.005 --> 03:33.606
This is like a small city out here.

03:36.695 --> 03:38.194
How many buildings
altogether do you have?

03:38.296 --> 03:39.495
Do you know?

03:39.597 --> 03:41.831
- Uh, about 22.
- 22?

03:41.933 --> 03:44.102
- Yeah.
- Wow.

03:44.202 --> 03:47.270
We've never done an
investigation like this.

03:47.372 --> 03:48.371
I can tell you that.

03:48.473 --> 03:50.707
Tell me, what's the
story? What's going on?

03:50.809 --> 03:53.276
We've had numerous
incidents with my volunteers,

03:53.378 --> 03:55.412
with my staff, with the general public.

03:55.514 --> 03:58.815
And we're starting to
get a reputation for being

03:58.917 --> 04:01.217
really a hotbed of paranormal activity.

04:01.319 --> 04:02.519
Now, Jeff, you mentioned on the phone

04:02.621 --> 04:04.854
you allowed a haunted
attraction to come in.

04:04.956 --> 04:05.989
That's correct.

04:06.091 --> 04:08.058
I partnered with one of my friends, Noa.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.626
So why would you do that?

04:09.728 --> 04:12.862
Well, because we wanted
to get younger people here,

04:12.964 --> 04:15.532
get them interested
in their own history.

04:15.634 --> 04:18.101
So obviously, we're here.
So something backfired.

04:18.202 --> 04:20.202
We've had a lot more activity.

04:20.305 --> 04:21.704
We have school children here.

04:21.807 --> 04:23.273
We have seniors.

04:23.375 --> 04:24.741
It's becoming a real problem.

04:24.843 --> 04:27.477
Okay, so tell me about
some of the experiences

04:27.579 --> 04:28.611
people are having.

04:28.714 --> 04:31.648
People have been seeing apparitions.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.550
They've been seeing spirits.

04:33.652 --> 04:35.618
Some people have been touched.

04:35.721 --> 04:38.488
We've had workers who have
volunteered for a night

04:38.590 --> 04:40.056
and never come back.

04:40.158 --> 04:42.058
People run out of here screaming.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.327
I feel very, very bad about it.

04:44.429 --> 04:48.631
I feel like perhaps it's been my fault

04:48.734 --> 04:50.700
partnering with Noa.

04:50.802 --> 04:52.635
I'm ultimately responsible for that.

04:52.738 --> 04:53.803
So what if Amy turned around

04:53.905 --> 04:55.739
and said you need to
shut down this attraction?

04:55.841 --> 04:58.374
Honestly, if we had to
shut down the whole thing,

04:58.477 --> 05:01.010
I'm not sure that we would survive that.

05:01.113 --> 05:02.178
Okay.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.949
Oh, boy.

05:06.051 --> 05:07.584
There are two types
of dead here...

05:07.686 --> 05:10.420
the ones who stay inside and
the ones who stay outside.

05:10.522 --> 05:15.525
The outside ones are the problem.

05:15.627 --> 05:18.695
Yeah. They're mad.
And they've got issues.

05:18.797 --> 05:20.296
They don't want us here.

05:20.398 --> 05:22.966
No, no, no, no, no, no.
They don't want us here.

05:23.068 --> 05:24.934
They are mostly out here, these people.

05:25.036 --> 05:27.937
They stay pretty much
outside all the...

05:28.039 --> 05:29.739
Pretty much all the time.

05:29.841 --> 05:33.843
I don't think they like the people.

05:33.945 --> 05:36.412
So they stay outside.

05:36.515 --> 05:39.749
One of the things that they
do to the living here is,

05:39.851 --> 05:43.153
obviously, they take their energy.

05:43.255 --> 05:44.988
It's got to be difficult, I think,

05:45.090 --> 05:46.356
for many people to be here

05:46.458 --> 05:49.726
because I think you would
feel immediately drained.

05:55.467 --> 05:57.834
So, now, what about
your own experiences?

05:57.936 --> 06:00.336
Well, I have had an experience
right in this house, right here.

06:00.438 --> 06:03.573
I was speaking to a tour
group in front of the kitchen.

06:03.675 --> 06:05.175
And a couple of pots banged together.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.442
Okay.

06:06.545 --> 06:08.845
Were the windows open,
wind going through there?

06:08.947 --> 06:10.180
No.

06:10.282 --> 06:11.314
All right. Anything else?

06:11.416 --> 06:14.117
Yeah. One night, I
was here with a friend.

06:14.219 --> 06:15.618
And we were walking along the sidewalk.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.754
And I looked down, and I noticed

06:17.856 --> 06:20.590
that there were three
shadows instead of two.

06:20.692 --> 06:21.858
And I knew which shadow was his

06:21.960 --> 06:23.459
'cause he was wearing a baseball hat.

06:23.562 --> 06:26.396
So I started to move to figure
out which shadow was mine.

06:26.498 --> 06:29.432
And in between us,
there was another shadow.

06:29.534 --> 06:31.301
A man, woman? Do you have any idea?

06:31.403 --> 06:32.735
You know, in that
area, we've...

06:32.838 --> 06:34.871
we've had other shadow activity.

06:34.973 --> 06:37.273
And people always seem
to think it's a male.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.942
Now, you said other people
have seen this shadow.

06:39.044 --> 06:40.210
Is that common?

06:40.312 --> 06:43.513
Yes, other people have
seen the shadow running

06:43.615 --> 06:47.083
and felt somebody brush past them.

06:47.185 --> 06:48.718
Let me ask you a question as far as

06:48.820 --> 06:50.954
what you're hoping to get
out of this investigation.

06:51.056 --> 06:52.956
I've been running this
thing for nine years.

06:53.058 --> 06:55.992
But now, we're at a point
where we've had so many problems

06:56.094 --> 06:58.094
that I don't know what to do.

06:58.196 --> 07:00.230
I want to be sure that the public,

07:00.332 --> 07:04.133
that my volunteers,
that my staff is safe.

07:04.236 --> 07:05.602
Okay.

07:07.172 --> 07:10.907
There's a man. And he
doesn't want us here.

07:11.009 --> 07:14.277
I'm definitely feeling,
like, a push, like, "Ahhhh."

07:14.379 --> 07:18.214
He's, like, this drunk guy, wasted.

07:18.316 --> 07:20.583
I think that people
would have, possibly,

07:20.685 --> 07:22.118
experiences with this man.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.587
He's very solid.

07:26.124 --> 07:29.225
I think they might feel trapped
and like they can't breathe.

07:29.327 --> 07:31.828
The wasted guy's in the tunnel.

07:31.930 --> 07:36.933
And what he's doing is just
bouncing back and forth,

07:37.035 --> 07:39.602
all along in there.

07:39.704 --> 07:43.506
I think that people would
probably see him like a shadow,

07:43.608 --> 07:46.276
but in human form.

07:52.017 --> 07:53.116
So, Noa, I was talking to Jeff.

07:53.218 --> 07:54.384
And he was explaining to me

07:54.486 --> 07:57.253
about how bad the
activity's gotten here.

07:57.355 --> 07:59.455
And he seems to think that it started

07:59.557 --> 08:02.458
when you guys started doing
the Halloween-type tours.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.693
You agree with that?

08:03.795 --> 08:05.695
I'm starting to believe
there's something.

08:05.797 --> 08:08.598
A few actors working for me
actually quit because of...

08:08.700 --> 08:10.266
- What's happened?
- Something, yeah.

08:10.368 --> 08:13.202
Have you had any experiences
at all that you can't explain?

08:13.305 --> 08:15.238
Yeah. I've had a few.

08:15.340 --> 08:16.539
Okay. Tell me about them.

08:16.641 --> 08:20.777
I would see the curtain go up and down.

08:20.879 --> 08:22.478
It looked like the curtain actually,

08:22.580 --> 08:24.814
like, was lifted up
and dropped, you know?

08:24.916 --> 08:26.983
And you're positive nobody
was in the house at the time?

08:27.085 --> 08:29.452
No. Nobody's in the house.
The doors are locked usually.

08:29.554 --> 08:30.620
That's why.

08:30.722 --> 08:32.422
Okay. Anything else?

08:32.524 --> 08:34.756
I've seen an apparition
of a little girl,

08:34.859 --> 08:36.893
maybe, like, around 4 or 5 years old.

08:36.995 --> 08:38.394
Did you get a color hair description?

08:38.496 --> 08:40.929
No, no. Maybe, like, black.

08:41.032 --> 08:42.799
- It was a darker color?
- Yeah.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.034
My partner says, when people
do these kind of attractions,

08:45.136 --> 08:49.005
they're antagonizing the spirits
and the dead that are here.

08:49.107 --> 08:50.373
Yeah. I thought about that.

08:50.475 --> 08:53.042
But, you know, pretty much
the whole state of Oahu is,

08:53.144 --> 08:55.511
like, a believer in this
kind of superstition.

08:55.613 --> 08:56.946
What if she turned around and said

08:57.048 --> 08:59.215
you guys need to shut this down,
or people are gonna get hurt?

08:59.317 --> 09:00.850
Wouldn't really care. I
wouldn't listen to her.

09:00.952 --> 09:02.952
I mean, we'd still be doing it.

09:03.054 --> 09:04.854
I would still continue.

09:09.361 --> 09:11.060
Yeah. I don't think these, you know,

09:11.162 --> 09:13.863
many of these dead people
really want to be here.

09:13.965 --> 09:15.198
There's an indication that,

09:15.300 --> 09:18.568
somehow, they were
trapped here by someone.

09:21.206 --> 09:23.439
People would have a really hard time

09:23.541 --> 09:24.874
with the dead out here.

09:24.976 --> 09:29.178
They're very [bleep]
present and pretty powerful.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.281
And then, the ones outside,

09:32.384 --> 09:35.385
they hate everybody
else, like, passionately.

09:35.487 --> 09:36.886
And they would really like

09:36.988 --> 09:40.790
to kick the other
deads' asses out of here.

09:40.892 --> 09:42.558
They want to get rid of the living.

09:42.660 --> 09:45.728
They were here first.

09:45.830 --> 09:48.941
They want this back.

10:10.556 --> 10:12.275
So, Moira,
talking to Jeff, he seems

10:12.375 --> 10:14.442
to feel guilty about what he started

10:14.544 --> 10:17.378
with this ghost tour thing,
that it was a bad idea.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.046
Do you agree with that at all?

10:19.148 --> 10:21.782
I agree. I didn't think
they should have done it,

10:21.885 --> 10:24.118
energize more spirits
in different houses

10:24.220 --> 10:27.488
and got them to be really active.

10:27.590 --> 10:29.523
Can I assume you've
had experiences or not?

10:29.626 --> 10:30.825
Yes.

10:30.927 --> 10:33.594
We seen a shadow by the Portuguese House

10:33.696 --> 10:37.131
of a man, and you could fully see him.

10:37.233 --> 10:40.968
And he just, poof, vanished.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.136
Okay. Anything else?

10:42.238 --> 10:45.139
So, we walked over to the Social Club,

10:45.241 --> 10:48.643
and we were standing
outside after a tour ended.

10:48.745 --> 10:51.412
And a door was
latched open, and it...

10:51.514 --> 10:53.814
Someone unlatched it,
and it just slammed shut.

10:53.917 --> 10:55.549
And some people started running.

10:55.652 --> 10:57.585
Okay. What was the weather like?

10:57.687 --> 10:59.287
Still, no wind.

10:59.389 --> 11:01.088
- Like it is now?
- Yes.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.523
Okay. Is there anything else?

11:02.625 --> 11:04.292
There's a doll case that's in here.

11:04.394 --> 11:06.093
And every morning,
they would come back in

11:06.195 --> 11:07.528
to make sure everything's clean,

11:07.630 --> 11:09.864
presentable for the next
tours during the day.

11:09.966 --> 11:11.532
The doll would be out on the ground.

11:11.634 --> 11:13.034
This case is enclosed.

11:13.136 --> 11:15.870
So it got to the point where
you'd come in every morning,

11:15.972 --> 11:17.672
and the thing would be
open, the doll would be out?

11:17.774 --> 11:18.839
Yes.

11:18.942 --> 11:20.341
Now, are you sure nobody
was playing a prank?

11:20.443 --> 11:21.342
Yes.

11:21.444 --> 11:22.843
How do we know that?

11:22.946 --> 11:24.011
'Cause they always

11:24.113 --> 11:25.613
close the windows and
lock everything up.

11:25.715 --> 11:27.615
One day, someone thought
they saw a little girl

11:27.717 --> 11:28.916
that was in here.

11:29.018 --> 11:30.918
So we think that she's
been playing with the doll.

11:31.283 --> 11:32.983
Okay, so you think the
spirit of a young child

11:33.085 --> 11:34.918
might have been taking the
doll out to play with it

11:35.020 --> 11:36.220
- when everybody went home?
- Yes.

11:36.823 --> 11:38.589
That's kind of sad, actually,
when you think about it.

11:38.691 --> 11:39.905
Yes, it is.

11:39.926 --> 11:41.325
Moira, with all the stuff
that's going on here,

11:41.427 --> 11:43.628
I've got to ask you, why are you
so interested in working here?

11:43.730 --> 11:45.630
It's kind of important
to my side of the family.

11:45.732 --> 11:47.932
My grandmother, she
worked on the plantation.

11:48.034 --> 11:49.600
- This plantation?
- Yes.

11:49.702 --> 11:51.202
Okay. So you're telling family history.

11:51.304 --> 11:52.003
Yes.

11:52.105 --> 11:53.738
Okay.

11:58.445 --> 12:00.011
There's a lot of people here

12:00.113 --> 12:02.547
who didn't get along
when they were alive.

12:02.649 --> 12:05.850
And now, it's even worse
because they're dead.

12:05.952 --> 12:08.620
All these dead people, they're
feeding off of living energy.

12:08.722 --> 12:10.989
And all this combined energy

12:11.091 --> 12:14.726
is creating poltergeist-type
of phenomenon,

12:14.828 --> 12:18.496
things ending up in places
where they weren't left,

12:18.598 --> 12:21.833
things flying across the room,
doors opening and closing,

12:21.935 --> 12:25.770
and objects moving.

12:25.872 --> 12:27.338
They're prepping for something.

12:27.441 --> 12:30.809
Something's gonna happen...

12:30.911 --> 12:33.812
something really bad.

12:40.821 --> 12:42.353
All right, so now, it seems like

12:42.456 --> 12:44.155
everybody's having experiences here.

12:44.257 --> 12:45.290
But what about yourself?

12:45.392 --> 12:46.958
I've had some experiences here, too.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.694
Okay. Explain some of them to me.

12:49.796 --> 12:52.964
Um, I'm pretty exhausted
when I leave here,

12:53.066 --> 12:55.733
nauseated, dizzy.

12:55.836 --> 12:57.252
Why do you think it's paranormal?

12:57.337 --> 12:58.657
I'm really healthy.

12:59.272 --> 13:02.874
So are you the only one having
these physical experiences here?

13:02.976 --> 13:04.476
Oh, there's other actors, too,

13:04.578 --> 13:06.778
that have either injuries or illnesses.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.581
Okay. Anything else?

13:09.683 --> 13:10.882
There were a few times

13:10.984 --> 13:13.785
when I came home with bruises
on my body, unexplained.

13:13.887 --> 13:16.621
Looks like a hand print,
like little fingerprints.

13:16.723 --> 13:18.857
Having bruising could be
a million-and-one things.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.425
But you're saying it
was the shape of a hand?

13:20.527 --> 13:21.593
Mm-hmm.

13:21.695 --> 13:22.694
Did you feel it?

13:22.796 --> 13:23.862
No. Oh, no.

13:23.964 --> 13:25.530
That's why I was
surprised when I got home

13:25.632 --> 13:26.397
and I had that bruise.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.765
Anything else?

13:27.868 --> 13:31.002
Yeah, there was an experience
that sticks in my mind.

13:31.104 --> 13:32.437
I got home from work,

13:32.539 --> 13:36.074
and I had a choking
sensation out of nowhere.

13:36.176 --> 13:37.442
And it was pretty scary.

13:37.544 --> 13:38.843
And I started to pray.

13:38.945 --> 13:40.011
And what happened?

13:40.113 --> 13:42.847
It eventually went
away, after my prayers.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.787
Oh, geez.

13:49.890 --> 13:52.957
You okay?

13:53.059 --> 13:56.928
What's going on? Um, I got attacked.

13:57.030 --> 13:58.296
I'm, like, freaked out.

13:58.398 --> 14:00.198
There's a guy, um,

14:00.300 --> 14:03.067
and he doesn't want me here.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.436
He's, like, really aggressive.

14:05.539 --> 14:06.638
Like, first, I didn't know...

14:06.740 --> 14:08.206
I didn't understand what was happening.

14:08.308 --> 14:09.474
But he got really mad.

14:09.576 --> 14:15.513
And so he was like,
grabbing me like this...

14:16.716 --> 14:18.082
...really hard.

14:18.185 --> 14:19.517
And I got scared

14:19.619 --> 14:25.023
because I felt like he was
gonna choke me to death.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.325
I think that he can
physically harm people,

14:27.427 --> 14:30.395
choke them out or scare
the [bleep] out of me.

14:30.497 --> 14:32.063
Like, I'm still scared.

14:43.932 --> 14:46.566
Jeffrey's property is
on an old sugar plantation.

14:46.668 --> 14:47.867
And you know what?

14:47.969 --> 14:49.368
It doesn't take a homicide detective

14:49.470 --> 14:51.270
to figure out where to
start this investigation.

14:51.372 --> 14:52.905
I'm on my way back to the property

14:53.007 --> 14:54.273
to meet a local historian,

14:54.375 --> 14:56.742
who said the conditions
there were absolutely brutal.

15:01.850 --> 15:03.783
What do you know about
the history of this place?

15:03.885 --> 15:06.052
It was built in 1897,

15:06.154 --> 15:08.087
and it stayed open for almost 100 years.

15:08.189 --> 15:08.888
Wow.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.590
It was about 10,000 acres,

15:10.692 --> 15:12.158
extended all the way
down to Pearl Harbor,

15:12.260 --> 15:14.126
which is that way.

15:14.229 --> 15:17.530
There are close to 1,000
people that worked here.

15:17.632 --> 15:18.831
All right. So do me a favor.

15:18.933 --> 15:20.233
Paint the picture. What's
their work day like?

15:20.335 --> 15:21.701
So, you leave before sunrise.

15:21.803 --> 15:24.670
You spend the entire day
working on the plantation.

15:24.772 --> 15:26.138
Back-breaking work.

15:26.241 --> 15:29.675
Now, the people who worked here,
did they live here, as well?

15:29.777 --> 15:30.843
Lived and died.

15:30.945 --> 15:32.411
What were living conditions like?

15:32.513 --> 15:34.447
Well, can you imagine
coming home to a house

15:34.549 --> 15:38.584
that has a corrugated tin
roof and your floor is dirt?

15:38.686 --> 15:42.154
The health conditions are
just unbelievably just filthy.

15:42.257 --> 15:44.624
You were lucky if your
baby lived to see a year.

15:44.726 --> 15:45.958
Geez.

15:46.060 --> 15:48.094
Are these native Hawaiians
that are in this picture?

15:48.196 --> 15:51.063
Native Hawaiians were
decimated by sicknesses.

15:51.165 --> 15:54.533
And so plantation bosses,
the chief laborers,

15:54.636 --> 15:57.236
had to go elsewhere to find
other people to bring here

15:57.338 --> 15:58.638
to work the plantation,

15:58.740 --> 16:01.207
like the Japanese, the
Chinese, the Filipinos,

16:01.309 --> 16:04.543
the Puerto Ricans, Portuguese
and even the Koreans.

16:04.646 --> 16:06.145
Okay, so now, with all these different

16:06.247 --> 16:08.447
cultures and ethnicities here,
did they all live together?

16:08.549 --> 16:09.782
What was the story?

16:09.884 --> 16:13.753
According to this map, everybody
was separated by ethnicity.

16:13.855 --> 16:16.088
Now, is that by the people
that worked here's choice

16:16.190 --> 16:17.556
or by the people that owned the place?

16:17.659 --> 16:19.191
People that owned the place.

16:19.294 --> 16:21.427
They wanted to make sure that
these different ethnicities

16:21.529 --> 16:23.696
didn't get together
and unionize and demand

16:23.798 --> 16:25.865
better living conditions and better pay.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.033
So they thought it was a better thing

16:27.135 --> 16:29.435
to keep them segregated,

16:29.537 --> 16:31.437
even to the point where
they began to pay people

16:31.539 --> 16:34.573
a different rate
according to the ethnicity.

16:34.676 --> 16:36.575
So, what was the purpose of
paying people differently?

16:36.678 --> 16:38.311
To make sure that they
resented each other

16:38.413 --> 16:40.713
and they didn't get along.

16:40.815 --> 16:42.768
Okay.

16:42.984 --> 16:45.651
These dead people
who are lined up outside,

16:45.753 --> 16:47.820
they were, like, neglected
or mistreated or something

16:47.922 --> 16:49.388
when they were alive.

16:49.490 --> 16:53.993
I think that they were kind
of starving at some point.

16:54.095 --> 16:58.030
They don't seem like they
had good clothing, either.

16:58.132 --> 17:01.901
Doesn't seem like they
had good shelter, either.

17:02.003 --> 17:04.369
They were outside a lot.

17:04.472 --> 17:07.106
They're pretty old. I
don't know from when.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.674
There's a lot of people here

17:08.776 --> 17:11.242
who didn't get along
when they were alive.

17:11.346 --> 17:13.412
And now, it's even worse
because they're dead

17:13.513 --> 17:15.448
and they're all [bleep]
jumbled together.

17:15.550 --> 17:19.719
Yeah. They're really mad.

17:19.820 --> 17:22.154
Look, when you got that
many people packed together

17:22.256 --> 17:23.189
under bad conditions,

17:23.290 --> 17:25.558
there's definitely gonna be violence.

17:25.660 --> 17:28.094
I had a retired detective
look into it for me.

17:28.195 --> 17:30.529
Says she found at least 10 homicides

17:30.631 --> 17:32.264
right on the plantation.

17:37.038 --> 17:39.772
Chris, I don't think I've
ever handled an investigation

17:39.874 --> 17:41.874
where I had at least 10
homicides in one location.

17:41.976 --> 17:44.744
Here's some of them.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.645
Okay.

17:46.748 --> 17:48.881
Did any of these stand out to you?

17:48.983 --> 17:52.752
Yes. April 5th of 1905.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.987
A captain in the police department,

17:55.089 --> 17:58.524
a lieutenant and four officers
are asked to assist a sheriff

17:58.626 --> 18:03.162
in raiding a gambling
game on the plantation.

18:03.264 --> 18:06.665
They arrested 11 Chinese laborers.

18:06.768 --> 18:07.767
Okay.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.369
All of a sudden, all hell breaks loose.

18:10.471 --> 18:12.304
Police and the prisoners get surrounded

18:12.407 --> 18:15.007
by the rest of the laborers
that are at the gambling game.

18:15.109 --> 18:16.308
Okay.

18:16.411 --> 18:20.046
Now they are being attacked
with clubs and sticks.

18:20.148 --> 18:22.048
Shots are fired.

18:22.150 --> 18:25.451
In the chaos, a laborer
named Chong Chi Fat

18:25.553 --> 18:27.486
was shot six times and was killed.

18:27.588 --> 18:29.055
Do we know who shoots him?

18:29.157 --> 18:33.859
There was never a determination
of who actually shot the man.

18:33.961 --> 18:35.761
Okay.

18:35.863 --> 18:39.965
I'm just hearing people
yelling numbers or something,

18:40.068 --> 18:41.200
some numbers.

18:41.302 --> 18:44.870
But it's, like, you know, "Eight, nine,

18:44.972 --> 18:47.506
two, zero, four, five, six! Ah!

18:47.608 --> 18:48.874
Three, nine, eight!"

18:48.976 --> 18:51.043
You know, like, somebody's
[bleep] yelling all this...

18:51.145 --> 18:53.279
These numbers.

18:55.416 --> 19:00.052
I'm hearing, um, a man
screaming and crying.

19:00.154 --> 19:04.390
It feels like his back is broken.

19:04.492 --> 19:08.761
Like, he is, like, on his forearms.

19:08.863 --> 19:10.529
He's looking at the ground.

19:10.631 --> 19:15.367
And there's something
on his back and his neck.

19:15.470 --> 19:18.938
He's just [bleep] screaming.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.841
Okay, so what was the other
homicide you were talking about?

19:21.943 --> 19:23.876
Well, in May 1985,

19:23.978 --> 19:27.680
we have a man that was
killed at a cock fight,

19:27.782 --> 19:30.916
which was across from
the plantation housing.

19:31.018 --> 19:32.585
And his name is Henry Cuba.

19:32.687 --> 19:35.287
All right, so what's this guy
get killed for? What happened?

19:35.389 --> 19:38.124
Mr. Cuba had gotten into
altercations with the guy

19:38.226 --> 19:40.092
that was running the chicken fight.

19:40.194 --> 19:42.728
And he also got into another altercation

19:42.830 --> 19:45.865
and was acting belligerent
and out of control

19:45.967 --> 19:47.366
with Jaime Fernandez.

19:47.468 --> 19:48.634
Who's this Fernandez guy?

19:48.736 --> 19:50.402
Just someone watching the fights?

19:50.505 --> 19:51.604
Yes.

19:51.706 --> 19:52.838
By the way you're
telling the story to me,

19:52.940 --> 19:54.440
it sounds like this
guy showed up already

19:54.542 --> 19:57.042
a little bit inebriated.

19:57.145 --> 19:59.245
So what's the circumstances
of this guy getting killed?

19:59.347 --> 20:02.414
Well, Fernandez went back
to his house, got his gun,

20:02.517 --> 20:04.583
came back to the chicken fight

20:04.685 --> 20:07.920
and shot him four times in the chest.

20:08.022 --> 20:09.455
Okay. Is he D.O.A. right there?

20:09.557 --> 20:12.024
And he died right there on the scene.

20:12.126 --> 20:13.159
Okay.

20:14.128 --> 20:16.862
That drunk dude is, like, wasted.

20:16.964 --> 20:18.297
And he's, like,

20:18.399 --> 20:21.834
running around, like,
just acting like a fool.

20:24.939 --> 20:26.605
Hmm. He's a big guy.

20:26.707 --> 20:28.941
He's not that old.

20:29.043 --> 20:32.478
I'd say, like, you know,
between 30 and 40 years of age.

20:32.580 --> 20:34.380
And he died...

20:34.482 --> 20:36.715
This was fairly recently,

20:36.817 --> 20:39.066
I would say within the last 20 years.

20:39.153 --> 20:41.320
But he's yelling about the animals.

20:41.422 --> 20:44.056
Like, all the animals died?

20:44.158 --> 20:45.257
There's a lot of confusion.

20:45.359 --> 20:48.327
Like, if you try to ask
him certain questions,

20:48.429 --> 20:50.717
he gets very confused.

20:51.933 --> 20:53.799
I really don't think that, right now,

20:53.901 --> 20:56.735
he doesn't understand that he's dead.

21:04.312 --> 21:05.511
If you need us to investigate

21:05.613 --> 21:07.413
unexplained activity in your home,

21:07.515 --> 21:09.515
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

21:09.617 --> 21:11.551
Click on, "Help me, Dead
Files," to submit your story,

21:11.653 --> 21:12.652
and we'll help if we can.

21:21.249 --> 21:24.550
So far, I know a deadly
riot and at least 10 homicides

21:24.652 --> 21:27.419
took place on my client's property.

21:27.522 --> 21:29.755
But I need to see if
there's anything else.

21:29.857 --> 21:33.159
Searching through old records,

21:33.261 --> 21:36.544
I find the plantation shared
a border with Pearl Harbor

21:37.732 --> 21:39.565
and that two people on Jeff's property

21:39.667 --> 21:42.902
were actually killed during the attack.

21:43.004 --> 21:45.037
I'm heading over to the
Naval base to meet with

21:45.139 --> 21:47.540
one of the world's foremost
authorities on Pearl Harbor.

21:47.642 --> 21:50.342
And he says Jeffrey's plantation
played an important role

21:50.444 --> 21:52.313
in that dark day in American history.

22:00.321 --> 22:03.756
Right here, this
is where it all started.

22:03.858 --> 22:05.057
So, during the attack,

22:05.159 --> 22:07.059
what am I seeing from
my client's property?

22:07.161 --> 22:09.762
You are seeing aircraft
buzzing about you like bees.

22:09.864 --> 22:11.397
You are seeing, in the distance,

22:11.499 --> 22:13.098
the Pacific fleet being destroyed.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.000
This whole area's a battlefield.

22:15.102 --> 22:17.736
So where your clients were
was part of the battlefield.

22:17.838 --> 22:21.893
There's indication that Japanese
aircrafts strafed that camp.

22:21.993 --> 22:24.360
And probably from a Japanese
pilot's point of view,

22:24.462 --> 22:25.828
it looked like a military camp.

22:25.930 --> 22:29.899
The two killed on my property
during the day of the attack,

22:30.001 --> 22:31.033
Is that from the Japanese fire?

22:31.135 --> 22:32.134
It's not.

22:32.236 --> 22:34.670
The indication is, it was friendly fire

22:34.772 --> 22:37.940
that was raining down all
over the island of Oahu

22:38.042 --> 22:41.343
from the anti-aircraft guns
firing at the Japanese planes.

22:41.446 --> 22:43.546
Now, what can you tell
me about the victims?

22:43.648 --> 22:45.414
There's a report that I have here.

22:45.516 --> 22:48.717
It indicates a Hawaiian
girl, 3 years of age,

22:48.820 --> 22:50.519
was hit by shrapnel.

22:50.621 --> 22:53.823
She died within 10 minutes of
being admitted to the hospital.

22:53.925 --> 22:57.827
And then, a 19-year-old
man, Tomaso Kimura,

22:57.929 --> 23:00.629
suffered a shrapnel wound
that penetrated his brain.

23:00.731 --> 23:03.566
He lost his life at
about 5:00 that afternoon,

23:03.668 --> 23:06.635
December 7, 1941.

23:06.737 --> 23:09.205
Oh, geez.

23:09.307 --> 23:13.108
I'm, like, hearing
yelling, [bleep] screaming.

23:13.211 --> 23:15.544
There's dirt and debris hitting my eyes,

23:15.646 --> 23:17.313
blinding so many people,

23:17.415 --> 23:19.281
like, so many people having this happen.

23:19.383 --> 23:23.519
Like, this dirt and all this
[bleep] is hitting their face.

23:23.621 --> 23:24.720
I can't breathe.

23:24.822 --> 23:26.822
Awful breathing problems, asphyxiation,

23:26.924 --> 23:28.691
incredibly dizzy and nauseous.

23:28.793 --> 23:34.330
And I feel, like, lots
of sticks piercing my body

23:34.432 --> 23:37.867
on my right jaw, my neck,
my left eye, my right side.

23:42.940 --> 23:45.007
So, Daniel, I'm aware
that Japanese immigrants,

23:45.109 --> 23:46.709
as well as Japanese Americans,

23:46.811 --> 23:48.177
worked on the plantation.

23:48.279 --> 23:50.613
Were they ever put in internment camps?

23:50.715 --> 23:51.413
Yes.

23:51.516 --> 23:52.681
After the attack,

23:52.783 --> 23:55.718
there was a suspicion that
the local Japanese population

23:55.820 --> 23:57.586
was somehow involved with it.

23:57.688 --> 24:01.657
There was arrests made,
and they were interned.

24:01.759 --> 24:03.759
The camp was established
on your property

24:03.861 --> 24:05.094
that you're investigating.

24:05.196 --> 24:09.365
It was known as Honouliuli.
And this is what it looked like.

24:09.467 --> 24:11.233
It was over 160 acres,

24:11.335 --> 24:13.836
barbed-wire fences
nearly eight feet tall,

24:13.938 --> 24:15.070
eight guard towers.

24:15.172 --> 24:16.505
It almost looks like a base.

24:16.607 --> 24:18.407
What was the population like this place?

24:18.509 --> 24:19.742
Well, there was two populations.

24:19.844 --> 24:22.778
Initially, 322 Japanese Americans

24:22.880 --> 24:23.946
were interned.

24:24.048 --> 24:26.015
Later on, as the months
progressed into the war,

24:26.117 --> 24:27.182
there'll be a population

24:27.285 --> 24:29.385
of Italian Americans
and German Americans,

24:29.487 --> 24:31.353
Koreans, were brought here

24:31.455 --> 24:34.089
because they were considered
possibilities of disloyalty.

24:34.191 --> 24:37.826
And here's some of their dossiers.

24:37.929 --> 24:39.528
So, what were the conditions
like for these people?

24:39.630 --> 24:42.998
Let's put it this way. They
called it Hell's Canyon.

24:43.100 --> 24:46.235
They lived in tents. They
had latrines they went to.

24:46.337 --> 24:49.104
It was hot, dusty, uncomfortable.

24:49.206 --> 24:50.973
It would be over 90 to 100 degrees

24:51.075 --> 24:52.107
in that canyon.

24:52.209 --> 24:54.610
So, it starts out as a plantation...

24:54.712 --> 24:56.145
And then a battlefield,

24:56.247 --> 24:59.848
and then an internment
and prisoner-of-war camp.

25:08.593 --> 25:12.027
Something about a camp.

25:12.129 --> 25:14.463
I don't know. A bunch of people
talking all at the same time.

25:14.565 --> 25:16.332
I can't understand any of it.

25:16.434 --> 25:18.400
Somebody's freaking out about the camp.

25:18.502 --> 25:20.302
Camp... Stop the
camp? I don't know.

25:20.404 --> 25:21.604
Something like this.

25:21.706 --> 25:23.305
You're just overhearing random snippets?

25:23.407 --> 25:25.040
Yeah. They're having,
like, meetings, like,

25:25.142 --> 25:26.842
"Should we talk about
these things or not?"

25:29.947 --> 25:32.948
Oh.

25:33.050 --> 25:37.886
I feel a lot of anxiousness,
stress, illness immediately.

25:37.989 --> 25:40.222
It's like a [bleep] tidal wave of it.

25:40.324 --> 25:42.591
There's a lot of people
running around in here

25:42.693 --> 25:45.194
like mad, like mad,
prepping for something.

25:45.296 --> 25:47.229
Something's gonna
happen. They need to talk.

25:47.331 --> 25:49.598
They need to take care
of the situation promptly.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.300
Something big, big, big is happening,

25:51.402 --> 25:52.901
and they're freaking
the [bleep] out about it.

25:53.004 --> 25:55.771
Whoo, so [bleep] stressful.

25:55.873 --> 25:57.339
Holy [bleep]

25:57.441 --> 26:00.209
My god, it's like whoosh.

26:00.311 --> 26:02.978
Like, crazy, crazy, crazy.

26:08.552 --> 26:11.687
I encountered many dead
people during my walk.

26:11.789 --> 26:15.224
But the angry group outside
had me the most concerned.

26:18.262 --> 26:21.363
I saw these people.

26:21.465 --> 26:25.234
They were all lined up, side by side.

26:25.336 --> 26:27.836
They were very upset.

26:27.938 --> 26:30.339
Basically, they want to
destroy the living here.

26:30.441 --> 26:32.741
They don't want anything to live here.

26:37.615 --> 26:40.863
Is this what you saw?

26:41.419 --> 26:43.786
Yes.

27:03.197 --> 27:06.198
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:06.300 --> 27:08.467
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:08.569 --> 27:10.463
and our clients for the first time.

27:11.146 --> 27:13.346
So, Amy, I'm sure this walk

27:13.448 --> 27:15.515
must have been a little
disorienting for you

27:15.617 --> 27:17.650
because the property here is so big.

27:17.752 --> 27:19.352
Mm-hmm.

27:19.454 --> 27:20.920
I don't want to give away too much,

27:21.022 --> 27:25.191
but this place used to be
a major sugar plantation.

27:25.293 --> 27:27.293
And now, it's a museum.

27:27.395 --> 27:28.428
Now, this is Jeff.

27:28.530 --> 27:30.830
He's been running the
place for almost 10 years.

27:30.932 --> 27:34.667
This is Laura and Moira.
They both work here.

27:34.769 --> 27:37.503
Activity is bad and getting worse.

27:37.606 --> 27:40.490
And Jeff is concerned
that, if they can't stop it,

27:40.590 --> 27:42.590
this important part of Hawaii's history

27:42.692 --> 27:44.091
may not survive.

27:44.193 --> 27:45.259
So with that,

27:45.361 --> 27:47.795
Amy knows a little
bit about the location.

27:47.897 --> 27:49.864
I'll ask her to
describe her walk for us.

27:52.869 --> 27:56.937
When I first arrived, I
got a lot of information.

27:57.039 --> 28:00.407
I was feeling the
emotions from the dead.

28:00.510 --> 28:04.845
And they seemed very stressed out.

28:04.947 --> 28:10.084
Then, I was seeing this
kind of glass dome structure.

28:10.186 --> 28:13.621
And inside of it was all of the dead.

28:13.723 --> 28:16.290
And I heard someone say,

28:16.392 --> 28:20.327
"Don't let them out. These are my pets."

28:20.429 --> 28:22.530
Well, might as well get right into this.

28:22.632 --> 28:26.033
When Jeff took over the
museum, business was slow.

28:26.135 --> 28:30.704
So a friend of his came with
an idea to turn this museum

28:30.806 --> 28:33.240
into a haunted attraction for 10 nights

28:33.342 --> 28:35.442
during the month of October.

28:35.545 --> 28:37.044
And that's when activity went nuts.

28:37.146 --> 28:38.045
Okay.

28:38.147 --> 28:40.881
So that's why they called us in.

28:40.983 --> 28:43.384
Now, tell Amy why you
thought you had to do this.

28:43.486 --> 28:44.985
Young people aren't exactly

28:45.087 --> 28:47.288
that interested in history sometimes.

28:47.390 --> 28:50.624
So we thought a haunted attraction would

28:50.726 --> 28:53.427
appeal to a younger demographic.

28:54.125 --> 28:55.992
Moira, when we spoke originally,

28:56.094 --> 28:57.593
you said you weren't
crazy about the idea

28:57.695 --> 28:59.896
of this haunted attraction.

28:59.998 --> 29:01.664
My parents and my grandparents

29:01.766 --> 29:04.967
would tell me that there's
strange things that happen here.

29:05.069 --> 29:06.669
My mom would tell me,
you know, "Be careful,"

29:06.771 --> 29:11.240
that the spirits that was here
would probably attack a person.

29:11.342 --> 29:14.377
Now, I talked to the guy
that runs the attraction.

29:14.479 --> 29:15.711
His name's Noa.

29:15.813 --> 29:17.213
I was thinking about
bringing him to the reveal,

29:17.315 --> 29:18.915
but, honestly, it was a waste of time.

29:19.017 --> 29:21.584
He told me he didn't really
care what you would have to say,

29:21.686 --> 29:23.486
and nothing would convince
him that what he's doing

29:23.588 --> 29:24.820
is a bad thing.

29:24.923 --> 29:27.990
Jeff, on the other hand,
thinks he's opened a door.

29:28.092 --> 29:30.660
And he thinks that they can't close it.

29:30.762 --> 29:34.597
I'm really concerned about
the increase in activity.

29:34.699 --> 29:37.367
And it's more confrontational now.

29:37.669 --> 29:41.133
It's kind of in-your-face
and very direct.

29:41.673 --> 29:45.308
Yeah, there's a lot of different
things going on as far as

29:45.410 --> 29:48.511
how the dead are interpreting
what you're doing.

29:48.613 --> 29:51.244
So some are irritated
and some are frightened

29:51.783 --> 29:53.466
and some are confused.

29:55.286 --> 29:58.603
I looked in the tunnel,
and I saw this man.

29:59.924 --> 30:02.011
He was kind of a mess.

30:02.694 --> 30:05.494
He had a special
attachment to this property.

30:05.597 --> 30:07.763
He used to be here a lot.

30:07.865 --> 30:09.899
I got that he was
probably in his 30s or 40s.

30:10.001 --> 30:13.302
And he died fairly recently,
within the last 20 years.

30:13.404 --> 30:17.573
And he was drunk when he died.

30:17.675 --> 30:21.344
And what I got that the
living might encounter there

30:21.446 --> 30:25.348
is hearing him bang into the
walls and things like that.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.383
And I believe that they would see him

30:27.485 --> 30:31.703
as a very, very dark, large shadow.

30:31.990 --> 30:33.756
Tell Amy that story.

30:33.858 --> 30:35.925
One day, I was walking with a friend.

30:36.027 --> 30:37.627
And we were just walking down the path.

30:37.729 --> 30:38.828
And then, I looked down,

30:38.930 --> 30:40.296
and I noticed there's
only the two of us,

30:40.398 --> 30:42.665
but there's three shadows on the ground.

30:42.767 --> 30:45.501
And I just kept looking at
that as we walked down the path.

30:45.603 --> 30:47.349
I was so surprised.

30:47.372 --> 30:49.171
What I found shocking about the property

30:49.274 --> 30:50.273
during my investigation

30:50.375 --> 30:52.575
is the amount of homicides
and strange deaths

30:52.677 --> 30:54.610
that occurred on the property.

30:54.712 --> 30:58.714
One of the most recent deaths
may be of interest to you.

30:58.816 --> 31:01.617
Now, back in '85, a group
of plantation employees

31:01.719 --> 31:05.628
used to hold illegal cock
fights on the land here.

31:05.757 --> 31:08.124
Now, there was a guy named Henry Cuba

31:08.226 --> 31:10.493
who used to come here all the time.

31:10.595 --> 31:14.730
May of 1985, he came here,
but he got into a fight

31:14.832 --> 31:17.033
with the guy running the cock fight

31:17.135 --> 31:18.625
and a couple of the patrons.

31:18.803 --> 31:22.392
It sounded like he was pretty
belligerent, and he was drunk.

31:23.007 --> 31:25.785
He gets into a fight with
this guy, Jaime Fernandez.

31:26.311 --> 31:27.443
This guy gets mad.

31:27.545 --> 31:29.645
He goes back to his house,
grabs a gun, comes back

31:29.748 --> 31:31.447
and plants four in this guy's chest.

31:31.549 --> 31:32.915
Wow.

31:33.018 --> 31:35.151
And he kills him right here.

31:36.381 --> 31:38.982
Now, you said the man
was between 30 and 40.

31:39.084 --> 31:41.349
Cuba was 40 when he got gunned down.

31:41.821 --> 31:46.623
I actually managed to track
down a photo from the family.

31:46.725 --> 31:48.916
This is him, here.

31:50.897 --> 31:51.929
This guy look familiar to you?

31:52.031 --> 31:54.065
Yeah, totally. Yeah.

31:54.167 --> 31:55.166
All right. So that's interesting.

31:55.268 --> 31:57.735
At least you know who
the shadow might be.

32:00.740 --> 32:02.273
Okay. So what else?

32:02.375 --> 32:07.578
I was standing on the
porch, and I got attacked.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.781
This person came up from
behind and to my side

32:10.883 --> 32:11.960
and grabbed my neck.

32:12.060 --> 32:16.329
Like, I was being choked
and was squeezing so hard.

32:16.429 --> 32:20.144
And it was excruciating pain.

32:20.244 --> 32:21.910
Then, he was standing in the doorway,

32:22.012 --> 32:24.980
and he was, like, a dark,
tall, you know, shadow figure.

32:25.082 --> 32:29.093
And I got that he, obviously,
doesn't want me here,

32:29.193 --> 32:31.059
doesn't want anybody here.

32:31.161 --> 32:33.462
He's aggressive.

32:33.564 --> 32:37.165
I think that the living would
have experiences with him

32:37.267 --> 32:39.860
and could possibly get physically hurt.

32:40.238 --> 32:44.640
One night that I went home
after doing the attraction,

32:44.742 --> 32:48.244
I had a choking sensation.

32:48.346 --> 32:51.847
I just started praying, and I just said,

32:51.949 --> 32:54.450
"Rebuke Satan in the name of Jesus."

32:54.552 --> 32:56.585
- And it just went away.
- Mm-hmm.

32:56.687 --> 32:58.821
And then, I also, another
night, had a bruise on my arms,

32:58.923 --> 33:00.923
like somebody was grabbing me.

33:01.025 --> 33:02.424
Now, does that sound like

33:02.526 --> 33:04.526
something that this guy might do?

33:04.629 --> 33:10.799
Yeah. And he is not good.

33:14.005 --> 33:15.271
Anything else?

33:15.373 --> 33:19.608
There's a lot of issues
here between the dead people.

33:20.225 --> 33:23.126
The dead who stay outside,

33:23.228 --> 33:26.997
they spent a lot of time
outside when they were alive.

33:27.099 --> 33:28.932
And they still like to be outside

33:29.034 --> 33:30.801
even though they're deceased.

33:30.903 --> 33:32.369
They were telling me

33:32.471 --> 33:35.038
that they were mistreated
when they were alive.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.339
They didn't have good clothing.

33:36.442 --> 33:38.108
They didn't have a lot of food.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.844
And their shelter was not so great.

33:40.946 --> 33:43.947
They didn't get along
that well with each other

33:44.049 --> 33:45.615
when they were alive.

33:45.717 --> 33:47.250
They're very unsettled.
They're very mad.

33:47.352 --> 33:48.552
They're very angry.

33:48.654 --> 33:51.555
And I heard, "The camp,
the camp. Stop the camp."

33:51.657 --> 33:55.158
Okay, well, the history of
this place is pretty incredible.

33:55.260 --> 33:58.028
There's two possibilities of
what you might have been seeing.

33:58.130 --> 34:00.197
As I mentioned before,
the museum sits on the land

34:00.299 --> 34:02.566
that used to be the
Oahu Sugar Plantation.

34:02.668 --> 34:03.667
Right.

34:03.769 --> 34:05.435
Now, the plantation ran
for almost 100 years,

34:05.537 --> 34:09.039
from 1897 to 1995.

34:09.141 --> 34:11.208
In the beginning, there
weren't enough local workers.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.143
So the plantation
owners brought people in

34:13.245 --> 34:14.478
from around the world.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.880
Now, the conditions
these workers lived in

34:16.982 --> 34:18.215
was horrible.

34:18.317 --> 34:21.751
They lived in tin-roofed
houses with this heat

34:21.853 --> 34:23.853
and, basically, dirt floors.

34:23.956 --> 34:26.022
Now, you mentioned that
the different groups

34:26.123 --> 34:27.424
didn't like each other.

34:27.525 --> 34:32.429
Well, the plantation owners
were worried they may unionize.

34:32.531 --> 34:36.433
So they made segregated camps.

34:36.534 --> 34:39.202
And they would pay each
ethnic group a different wage

34:39.304 --> 34:41.505
so that they would resent each other.

34:41.607 --> 34:44.507
Now, there is one other possibility.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.443
When this place was a plantation,

34:46.545 --> 34:49.079
it actually touched the
shores of Pearl Harbor.

34:49.181 --> 34:51.514
Now, when Pearl Harbor
was bombed in '41,

34:51.617 --> 34:53.783
the Americans fired
at the Japanese planes.

34:53.886 --> 34:57.053
And you had two fatalities
right on the property

34:57.155 --> 34:58.889
from friendly fire.

34:58.991 --> 35:01.558
The day after the attack,
martial law is imposed,

35:01.660 --> 35:04.294
and the military rounded
up Japanese immigrants

35:04.396 --> 35:05.695
and Japanese Americans,

35:05.797 --> 35:07.364
and they placed them
in an internment camp

35:07.466 --> 35:08.431
right on this property.

35:08.534 --> 35:10.300
Oh.

35:10.402 --> 35:13.537
And I got photos of that.

35:13.639 --> 35:15.438
The conditions were so bad at this camp,

35:15.541 --> 35:18.308
they called it Hell's Canyon.

35:18.410 --> 35:19.609
As the war waged on,

35:19.711 --> 35:22.045
not only did they bring
Japanese P.O.W.s here.

35:22.147 --> 35:23.747
They brought in German, Italian,

35:23.849 --> 35:25.949
and kept them separated
in the same camp.

35:26.051 --> 35:28.919
So based on the
information that I provided,

35:29.021 --> 35:31.321
who do you think you
might have ran into?

35:31.423 --> 35:36.760
I think that they're
probably from both camps.

35:36.862 --> 35:40.297
And I think they're from
different time periods.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.332
Now, Moira, your grandparents
worked on this plantation.

35:42.434 --> 35:43.466
Yes.

35:43.569 --> 35:44.801
How's that make you
feel, hearing all this?

35:44.903 --> 35:46.102
It's, like, sad.

35:46.204 --> 35:48.138
We didn't even realize
how many of them were here.

35:48.240 --> 35:51.274
It's sad to see them, you
know, get caught in here.

35:51.376 --> 35:53.109
I wouldn't want to be caught here.

35:53.211 --> 35:54.878
So now, the dead people on the outside,

35:54.980 --> 35:57.347
do they interact with
the living in any way?

35:57.449 --> 35:59.516
They feed off the energy of the living.

35:59.618 --> 36:02.319
So I think that, when
people would leave here,

36:02.421 --> 36:07.090
they would feel excessively drained.

36:07.192 --> 36:09.492
Like, also, people would
feel stressed and anxious

36:09.595 --> 36:10.994
because they are so angry.

36:11.096 --> 36:12.529
The other thing that I got

36:12.631 --> 36:17.567
is that they've become able to
interact with their environment.

36:17.669 --> 36:22.639
And so they can make
doors open and close.

36:22.741 --> 36:26.343
They're able to move objects
from one location to another

36:26.445 --> 36:29.713
and also move objects,
like, in front of you.

36:29.815 --> 36:34.451
Well, now you're hitting
on pretty much everything

36:34.553 --> 36:35.919
these guys are experiencing.

36:36.021 --> 36:38.188
Moira, tell Amy about the doll.

36:38.290 --> 36:40.991
We have a doll. It's in a Japanese case.

36:41.093 --> 36:43.593
How they built it was with
glass on both sides of the wood.

36:43.695 --> 36:45.962
Every morning, when we came to
make sure everything was clean,

36:46.064 --> 36:48.531
nothing was messed, the
doll would be outside.

36:48.634 --> 36:50.667
Tell her about the
story right in this room.

36:50.769 --> 36:53.203
We were standing outside on the porch.

36:53.305 --> 36:56.506
So the door's really
heavy, and it was latched.

36:56.608 --> 36:59.075
And all of a sudden, the
door just slammed really hard.

36:59.177 --> 37:00.143
Everybody else jumped.

37:00.245 --> 37:02.379
We saw some people run the other way.

37:02.481 --> 37:05.482
Laura, tell Amy about
co-workers getting sick.

37:05.584 --> 37:11.721
Getting dizzy, nauseated,
kind of a streak of the flu.

37:12.338 --> 37:14.205
I'm pretty exhausted when I leave here.

37:14.307 --> 37:15.239
So does that make sense?

37:15.341 --> 37:17.975
Yes.

37:18.077 --> 37:19.477
I did do a sketch

37:19.579 --> 37:22.947
of some of the outside
people that I encountered

37:23.049 --> 37:25.349
and how they are draining the living.

37:33.393 --> 37:35.726
Take a look at this.

37:35.828 --> 37:36.894
Oh, God.

37:36.996 --> 37:38.329
Oh, my gosh.

37:38.431 --> 37:39.297
Uh-huh.

37:42.936 --> 37:46.223
That explains why I feel
the way I do sometimes.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.439
What do these people want?

37:48.542 --> 37:51.643
The majority of them feel
that they were here first

37:51.745 --> 37:53.478
and this was their land.

37:53.580 --> 37:56.781
So their common goal, the
people who live outside,

37:56.883 --> 37:58.583
is to drive out everyone here.

37:58.685 --> 38:01.386
They want the dead gone, and
they want the living gone.

38:01.488 --> 38:04.022
Wow. Oh, my God.

38:06.192 --> 38:07.925
How's that make you
feel, hearing all this?

38:08.027 --> 38:10.594
Just really freaks me out.

38:10.697 --> 38:13.998
I'm just stunned.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.100
I can understand why
all this is happening,

38:16.202 --> 38:17.868
to know how many spirits are here.

38:17.970 --> 38:21.205
It's like they have no rest.

38:21.307 --> 38:23.107
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable

38:23.209 --> 38:25.050
coming back here to work.

38:39.396 --> 38:42.363
One thing I've learned
this week is that Hawaiians

38:42.465 --> 38:45.533
have a very different
attitude about the paranormal.

38:45.635 --> 38:47.302
You believe in spirits,

38:47.404 --> 38:50.038
and you believe in respecting the dead.

38:50.140 --> 38:52.307
So I know you want to make
sure this place is safe

38:52.409 --> 38:54.776
for both the living and the dead.

38:54.878 --> 38:59.814
To find out how you can do that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

38:59.916 --> 39:04.085
I think that, if you do a few things,

39:04.187 --> 39:06.854
it'll help a great deal.

39:06.957 --> 39:09.691
The first thing that
I would have you do,

39:09.793 --> 39:12.927
because you have such
an eclectic group here,

39:13.029 --> 39:17.031
is to find various religious leaders.

39:17.133 --> 39:20.234
And then, those
individuals would proceed

39:20.337 --> 39:24.539
to do funeral rites from their faith.

39:24.641 --> 39:27.342
This would assist the dead that are here

39:27.444 --> 39:30.712
from that particular religion
to go ahead and move on.

39:30.814 --> 39:33.047
Then, what I would have you do

39:33.149 --> 39:37.418
is bring in maybe three
or four different mediums

39:37.520 --> 39:42.857
to do a walk and see if
they find any dead people

39:42.959 --> 39:47.328
that couldn't move on
because they don't have

39:47.430 --> 39:49.731
a particular faith that they follow.

39:49.833 --> 39:52.667
The mediums will help
those dead move on.

39:52.769 --> 39:55.553
Okay, so, what about the
guy that's choking people?

39:55.705 --> 39:59.774
I think that he probably
would prefer to move on.

39:59.876 --> 40:01.642
But if you have any more incidents,

40:01.745 --> 40:05.780
then you're going to need
to bring in an exorcist.

40:09.353 --> 40:11.820
Now, as far as the haunted tours go,

40:11.922 --> 40:15.690
maybe toning it down just a smidge.

40:15.792 --> 40:17.359
How can we tone it down?

40:17.461 --> 40:18.660
You know, maybe only having,

40:18.762 --> 40:22.097
like, one or two of the locations open.

40:22.199 --> 40:23.298
Yeah, that would be nice.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.301
I mean, it wasn't as bad
when you first started.

40:26.403 --> 40:29.504
The years pass on,
and it got more spooky.

40:29.606 --> 40:31.039
It really got worse.

40:31.141 --> 40:35.977
How's your boy, Noa, gonna
take this toning down stuff?

40:36.079 --> 40:40.048
Well, I think we can work it out.

40:40.150 --> 40:43.118
What are you shaking your head for?

40:43.220 --> 40:44.653
I mean, I don't want to disappoint,

40:44.755 --> 40:46.421
but I don't think he's gonna like it.

40:46.523 --> 40:48.890
You gonna talk to him, or
you just gonna, you know?

40:48.992 --> 40:50.392
Of course I'm gonna talk to him.

40:50.494 --> 40:53.962
I mean, he needs us, you know?

40:54.064 --> 40:56.297
Now, Laura, if Jeff
follows Amy's advice,

40:56.400 --> 40:57.565
will you come back?

40:57.668 --> 40:59.868
Yeah.

41:00.324 --> 41:02.290
It's encouraging to
know that we can help

41:02.393 --> 41:03.558
the dead that are here.

41:03.660 --> 41:07.629
And that's, I think, what
our hope was to begin with.

41:07.731 --> 41:10.399
It's been a real education.

41:10.501 --> 41:12.667
I'll ask you first. You
gonna take Amy's advice?

41:12.770 --> 41:13.935
Yeah, definitely.

41:14.038 --> 41:18.045
I mean, to do nothing
would just make it worse.

41:18.145 --> 41:19.842
Whatever will make this place better.

41:19.942 --> 41:22.509
I'm gonna make sure he's gonna
do what he's supposed to do.

41:22.611 --> 41:24.344
It's very important.

41:26.448 --> 41:28.315
I really hope Jeff follows my advice,

41:28.417 --> 41:30.951
or the dead will continue
to put all those who visit

41:31.053 --> 41:32.586
in harm's way.

41:32.688 --> 41:35.022
But I believe, if he
performs funeral rites,

41:35.124 --> 41:38.025
brings in mediums and
tones down the haunted tour,

41:38.127 --> 41:39.159
the dead will move on,

41:39.261 --> 41:41.361
and this important
piece of Hawaii's history

41:41.463 --> 41:43.564
can stay open for years to come.
