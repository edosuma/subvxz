WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:09.077
[ Steam Hissing ]
Hot enough for you?

00:09.110 --> 00:12.346
Ooh. You know the Russians.
They don't go in
for boiling hot.

00:12.380 --> 00:17.518
Not like your Finns,
or your--
your Turkish baths.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.720
[ Both Chuckling ]

00:19.753 --> 00:22.090
Now, that's hot for you.
Istanbul?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.692
Now, that--
that was like an oven.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.727
The look
on your face, man.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.997
Oi, oi, oi.
Enough of that.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.032
I couldn't understand
the guy's English.

00:32.066 --> 00:36.104
- I thought he said to me,
"Do you want a towel?"
- No, a towel afterwards.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.572
Those Turks,
they take care
of all your needs.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.242
Yeah, but there's
no accounting for taste,
is there?

00:41.275 --> 00:44.345
What?
To your left.
Keep talking.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.215
Well, we certainly
racked up some, uh--

00:47.248 --> 00:50.384
some miles on
the old company shilling now,
didn't we?

00:50.418 --> 00:53.187
[ Jonas ]
Oh, yeah.
Wait till he makes contact.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.723
Has he got it with him?
Yeah, in his pocket.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.791
[ Both Chuckling ]

01:07.101 --> 01:09.237
Okay, I got him.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.242
I don't think his buyer's here.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.880
Oh, well.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.083
- What you reckon?
Should we get him?
- No, not without the buyer.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.819
He's probably on the phone
right now calling it off.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.156
He's on to us.
Yeah.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.990
And bird-dogging him
only confirms his suspicions.

01:30.023 --> 01:33.827
I don't believe this.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.797
Three countries
and four cities,
and no handoff.

01:36.830 --> 01:40.000
Devon,
we'll get another shot.

01:40.033 --> 01:43.304
He's not going home
to Mother Russia
without making the sale.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.310
[ Man ]
There were no sudden movements?

01:49.343 --> 01:52.313
No.
No signal? No tell?

01:52.346 --> 01:54.448
No.
But the Russian was tipped off.

01:54.482 --> 01:57.017
You suggest that's why he fled.
No, I didn't say that.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.453
He got spooked.
He ran.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.289
So you're saying
there was nothing
about Agent Burke's behavior...

02:01.322 --> 02:03.424
that struck you
as suspicious?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.659
I find that hard to believe.
I find it hard to believe...

02:05.693 --> 02:08.496
that a man
I've known for years
is a traitor to his country.

02:08.529 --> 02:12.200
This isn't pleasant
for any of us,
Devon being one of our own.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.302
But that is why
you were brought in.

02:14.335 --> 02:18.306
- To betray a friend?
- To root out a common enemy
of our two countries.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.309
My orders are only
to take down the Russian,

02:21.342 --> 02:25.313
prevent the smuggling
of stolen uranium to
potential terrorist buyers.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.848
Yes. Well,

02:29.550 --> 02:31.485
you had the Russian
in Gdansk.

02:31.519 --> 02:35.356
Then the sale was
taking place in Brussels.

02:35.389 --> 02:38.492
And now
he decamps on you here.
You're being played, Sergeant,

02:38.526 --> 02:42.029
and our intel network
is being compromised.

02:42.062 --> 02:45.333
If Devon is
the leak in our apparatus,
you have to stop him.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.469
- [ Door Opens ]
- Gentlemen, I apologize.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.572
[ Door Closes ]
I was detained
by the ambassador.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.041
I am the embassy's liaison
to the British home office.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.410
- I guess I missed
the swearing in.
- It's good to see you again.

02:56.444 --> 02:59.213
- Mrs. Ryan.
- Canning.
I've taken my maiden name.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.148
Miss Canning.
However,
all pleasantries aside--

03:01.181 --> 03:02.483
Yeah?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.518
Agent Burke.
All right.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.320
He doesn't know
you're having this meeting?
No.

03:06.354 --> 03:09.423
Is he the leak?
As I've already said--

03:09.457 --> 03:12.360
Sergeant Blane is reluctant
to shred the relationship.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.363
- What about your relationship
with Mrs. Burke?
- What about her?

03:15.396 --> 03:18.566
- Well, you've seen her
over the years?
- A bit. Not much, no.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.402
You almost married her.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.904
I think we're done here.
Why are we done here?

03:23.937 --> 03:26.840
You can't expect us to ignore
the fact you were engaged
to the fellow's wife.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.042
I won't involve her.

03:29.076 --> 03:32.045
No one is asking you
to involve her. You are
being asked for information.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.181
We are seeking only information.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.417
- No.
- No?

03:36.450 --> 03:39.453
Your friend may be selling
nuclear materials to terrorists,

03:39.487 --> 03:42.623
and your history with his wife
may be very important to us.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.293
And your response is no?

03:45.326 --> 03:47.695
- Have you ever heard
of E.M. Forster?
- He pitch for the Angels?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.697
He was a British writer.
He said:

03:49.730 --> 03:52.533
"Given the choice
between betraying my country
and betraying a friend,

03:52.566 --> 03:55.936
I hope I would have the courage
to betray my country."

03:55.969 --> 03:58.939
- Noble sentiments.
- You know what those
noble sentiments are called?

03:58.972 --> 04:00.841
They're called treason.

04:03.277 --> 04:06.079
[ Chuckling ]
So get the picture.

04:06.113 --> 04:10.718
Gadhafi has got
his full team with him
when he lands at Durban.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.722
Over 400 of them, including
the female bodyguards.
Amazons.

04:14.755 --> 04:19.660
As I remember,
my partner here,
he turns around and says,

04:19.693 --> 04:21.629
"Can we have a look-see
in the hold...

04:21.662 --> 04:24.765
just in case you're carrying
bombs or uncustomed scotch
or something?"

04:24.798 --> 04:27.735
I was being thorough.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.670
Oh, yeah.

04:29.703 --> 04:33.273
So tell them what we found.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.675
- What was in the hold?
- Go on, Jonas.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.777
Goats.

[ Laughing ]
Goats.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.582
[ Jonas ]
Goats.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.752
It was filled
with goat carcasses.
[ Sighs ]

04:44.785 --> 04:47.588
And the stench,
you wouldn't believe.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.657

in August.
[ Woman ] Brilliant.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.361
To you, my friend.

Right back at you,

04:55.363 --> 04:58.332
Heather, go and get us
another bottle.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.968
Why did he bring
goat carcasses?
[ Jonas ] No idea.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.337
Just go and get us
another bottle.

05:03.371 --> 05:07.207
I'm afraid
that was the last one.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.811
- Nonsense.
- Your last one,
that's for sure.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.851
So what kind of hosts
are we then?
[ Jonas ] Hey, you know what?

it's getting late anyway.
- No, no, no, no.

You're not leaving.
I'm gonna go and find us
something wet.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.898
You come and visit me
in my own home,
and what do you find?

A cheap bastard
who can't even afford
to entertain his friends.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.538
- Come on, man.
- No. I mean,
look at this place. Look.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.874
Look at these piss-poor chairs!
What is that, vinyl?

- Just shut up!

of taking care of myself.

You know something?
You was better off
with him anyway.

No need to apologize.

06:41.602 --> 06:45.773
Lately, he's become
so... bitter.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.408
About what?
Everything.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.578
Our marriage, his job.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.580
Of course,
he doesn't talk
about his work, but--

06:52.613 --> 06:55.716
I understand.
He's under such stress.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.651
Maybe he can't
take it anymore.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.753
Does he talk
about quitting?

07:02.022 --> 07:05.626

do you ever think...

07:05.659 --> 07:08.128
about how it might have
turned out between us?

Heather.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.032
I do.

I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

Have you forgiven me
for the awful way
I left you?

maxed out long ago.

too hard on yourself...

- Can I give her a message?
- No, no. I'll-- Thanks.

My husband's on his
third tour in Iraq,
and he's okay and all,

but we have
a three-year-old daughter
with a heart disease.

she needs expensive surgery.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.881
I'm so sorry.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.117
The thing is,
the army now outsources
its medical insurance,

09:44.151 --> 09:46.987
and the company won't pay
for the operation.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.156
Is there nothing we don't
contract out in today's army?

Have you gone
to your husband's C.O.?

09:51.491 --> 09:54.962
I've gone to everyone.

with the red tape.

- Maybe we can help.
- I don't know where else
to turn. I'm at my end.

be as bad as all that.

No, no. Don't even joke.
Your daughter needs you.

the new stripes right here.
- Uh-huh.

the kids up from school.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.978
They're shuttin'
the whole place down.

40:47.012 --> 40:51.617
Hey, dude? Llama?
Huh?

40:51.650 --> 40:53.652
I'm looking for Annie,
the bartender. You seen her?
Yeah.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.721
Around the side.

40:58.790 --> 41:03.529
Hey, Annie.
Hey.

41:06.832 --> 41:09.200
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.

41:09.234 --> 41:12.037
Just out of a job...
again.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.673
Looks that way.
How are you doing?

41:14.706 --> 41:16.542
Me? I'm all right.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.944
Yeah?

41:18.977 --> 41:22.180
No. I, uh--

41:22.213 --> 41:24.683
I've been thinking a lot about
what happened before, and--
Hey, look.

41:24.716 --> 41:29.220
You don't have to explain.
I get it.
I miss Hector too.

41:29.254 --> 41:32.357
No, there's more
to it than that.
I--

41:34.893 --> 41:37.328
If you and me
were to get involved--

41:37.362 --> 41:39.531
Yeah.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.466
If you and I--

41:41.499 --> 41:43.969
[ Sighs ]
No, come on.
I'm listening.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.905
Look, if you and I
get invol--

41:46.938 --> 41:49.875
* We started a fire

41:49.908 --> 41:52.744
* She's made me a liar

41:52.778 --> 41:54.913
* I said I don't need love

41:54.946 --> 41:57.883
* I've made it this far

41:57.916 --> 42:01.519
* She broke through
the surface *

42:01.553 --> 42:04.690
* It's hard not to notice

42:04.723 --> 42:07.258
* The way I breathe deeper

42:07.292 --> 42:09.895
* I've made it this far *

42:09.928 --> 42:11.830
She's stabilized now.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.332
Well, you earned
your stripes today, Sergeant.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.168
Not exactly the celebration
you had in mind, but--

42:17.202 --> 42:19.671
No, you made
the right choice though.

42:19.705 --> 42:22.440
After this,
I think I'm gonna put
the mike down for a while.

42:22.473 --> 42:25.343
At least until after
the baby's born.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.113
Well, don't be so quick
to decide, you know?

42:28.146 --> 42:32.550
There was a part of me
that felt--
What?

42:32.584 --> 42:35.353
Powerful.
Mmm.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.456
Is that awful to admit?
No.
What's wrong with power?

42:38.489 --> 42:43.028
When you're away on a mission
and I'm at home waiting,

42:43.061 --> 42:45.030
Mm-hmm.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.398
I feel so helpless.

42:47.432 --> 42:50.101
And there's nothing
I can do to protect you.

42:50.135 --> 42:52.804
And here was someone who--

42:52.838 --> 42:54.640
Who you could save.

43:10.455 --> 43:14.125
Who gave the order to fire?

43:14.159 --> 43:16.094
Those men were to wait
for my signal.

43:16.127 --> 43:18.496
If they'd waited,
you'd be dead.

43:18.529 --> 43:20.966
- We had a deal.
- I couldn't be sure.

43:20.999 --> 43:23.902
Of what?
That you hadn't gone soft.

43:23.935 --> 43:26.171
Kiss my ass.

43:27.973 --> 43:29.975
Well, he was a traitor.

43:30.008 --> 43:31.476
He was my friend.

43:38.216 --> 43:40.151
And she--

43:42.287 --> 43:46.124
Given the choice
between betraying a friend
and betraying your country?

43:48.226 --> 43:50.161
There is no choice.

43:50.195 --> 43:53.631
That's right.
Not for you.
