WEBVTT

00:20.144 --> 00:22.146
(clattering)

00:30.287 --> 00:32.957
Jimmy, if you're thinking
of getting into ski porn,

00:32.990 --> 00:35.526
it's a niche audience
and the work is seasonal.

00:35.559 --> 00:36.794
I have it all worked out,
Gretchen--

00:36.828 --> 00:38.596
what I saw from
my tree house last night:

00:38.630 --> 00:40.564
my father is no longer

00:40.598 --> 00:43.034
a force in my life,
thus, everything I am

00:43.067 --> 00:45.036
and have is suspect,

00:45.069 --> 00:47.471
acquired or decided,
as it all were, in the context

00:47.504 --> 00:51.108
of being "Ronny's son,"
which I am no longer, thus,

00:51.142 --> 00:52.476
reevaluation.

00:52.509 --> 00:54.578
It's all up for review.

00:54.612 --> 00:57.915
So, I'm making a pros and cons
list of everything in my life

00:57.949 --> 01:00.785
to work out whether I still
need it or not.

01:00.818 --> 01:03.154
Oh, boy.
It's the perfect

01:03.187 --> 01:06.157
post-emotional analytic tool
to determine the inherent,

01:06.190 --> 01:09.560
unsullied qualitative value
of anything.

01:09.593 --> 01:11.796
To whit. Stapler.

01:11.829 --> 01:14.331
Pros:
petite, efficient, comely.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.134
Cons: literally no place
for you in the digital world.

01:17.168 --> 01:18.602
Good-bye, old girl.

01:21.438 --> 01:23.574
Hmm... tough one.

01:23.607 --> 01:26.143
Pros: strong tassels,

01:26.177 --> 01:27.578
I look fantastic in it.

01:27.611 --> 01:30.247
Cons: I saw Moby
wearing the same one

01:30.281 --> 01:31.582
on the cover of Yoga Life.

01:31.615 --> 01:33.217
And there's the answer.

01:34.518 --> 01:36.420
Right. My stuff...

01:36.453 --> 01:38.455
there's your stuff...

01:43.695 --> 01:44.461
Hmm?

02:04.816 --> 02:07.284
Oh! Fine! Jesus Christ!

02:07.318 --> 02:09.353
Fine, Jimmy.
Do your insane,

02:09.386 --> 02:12.289
idiotic thing
and get this over with.

02:12.323 --> 02:14.892
Gretchen pro-con list, go.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.495
Well, okay.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.364
You and your stupid tree house.

02:20.397 --> 02:22.399
I swear, I wish I'd never
mentioned Dead Poets Society

02:22.433 --> 02:24.401
in front of you.
You literally just did

02:24.435 --> 02:27.538
the standing on the desk
thing, but higher.

02:27.571 --> 02:29.173
The quicker we do this,
the quicker we can

02:29.206 --> 02:31.508
move on with our lives.

02:31.542 --> 02:35.079
I have stuff to do for Shitstain
and Jaclyn's elopement party.

02:35.112 --> 02:36.547
Bet your ass
he's not making a list.

02:37.681 --> 02:40.151
Okay, fine.

02:40.184 --> 02:43.888
Here are two things to
start off your pro list.

02:43.921 --> 02:46.958
Bam! Carpe those diems.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.761
Aw, man.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.395
I slept in gum again?

02:51.428 --> 02:52.764
(groans)

02:54.098 --> 02:55.366
Just know that, uh,

02:55.399 --> 02:56.768
this is gonna be
a waste of your time.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.069
The end result
is gonna be,

02:58.102 --> 02:59.203
"Damn, she's awesome.

02:59.236 --> 03:01.005
"That list was pointless.

03:01.038 --> 03:03.340
"Wasted all that paper and ink.

03:03.374 --> 03:05.943
Sorry trees. Sorry squids."

03:07.979 --> 03:10.915
Wait, is that
how you think we get ink?

03:10.948 --> 03:12.950
From squids?

03:14.118 --> 03:15.619
No.

03:16.921 --> 03:18.289
Aw, damn it!

03:20.657 --> 03:23.094
*

03:28.065 --> 03:30.868
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:30.902 --> 03:33.604
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:33.637 --> 03:36.941
* Gonna leave you anyway.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.752
(sniffs)

03:48.786 --> 03:50.287
(indistinct chatter,
dishes clinking)

03:52.957 --> 03:54.959
(upbeat music playing)

04:06.871 --> 04:08.873
Ooh. Ceviche?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.683
I don't get it.
A pros and cons list about you?

04:19.716 --> 04:20.985
What's on it?

04:21.017 --> 04:22.786
Oh, who cares?
We all have negative shit

04:22.820 --> 04:24.355
we think about everyone
in our lives.

04:24.388 --> 04:26.757
Yeah, but writing it
down makes it real.

04:26.790 --> 04:29.927
Like Web sites or
fortune cookies.

04:29.961 --> 04:32.529
So, how'd Paul react to the news
that you're leaving him?

04:32.563 --> 04:34.265
Ain't told him yet.

04:34.298 --> 04:37.501
First I got to set myself
up, get my own place.

04:37.534 --> 04:40.037
And it'll be so phat because
I'll be getting those sweet

04:40.071 --> 04:41.672
monthly checks
from the prenup.

04:41.705 --> 04:43.707
Wait, what?
You have a prenup?

04:43.740 --> 04:47.011
(laughs) Yeah, Paul was like,
"Oh, honey, we don't need one."

04:47.044 --> 04:50.014
But uh-uh, I didn't
fall for that shit.

04:50.047 --> 04:52.649
So, like a boss,
I made him.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.485
Lindsay, you ding-dong.

04:54.518 --> 04:57.388
A prenup protects
the wealthier person, him,

04:57.421 --> 05:01.792
in a divorce from giving his
money to the poorer person, you.

05:01.825 --> 05:03.895
Are you goddamn
kidding me?

05:03.928 --> 05:06.163
And you let me
get an abortion?!

05:06.197 --> 05:08.532
I had a ticket
to 18 years of dough

05:08.565 --> 05:11.035
and you let me flush my ticket?

05:11.068 --> 05:14.071
Hey, just focus.

05:14.105 --> 05:17.308
Do the most important thing
first: tell Paul.

05:17.341 --> 05:19.510
Once you do that,
you can figure out your life.

05:19.543 --> 05:22.746
Now I have to get
a stupid job.

05:22.779 --> 05:24.381
Can I have a job?

05:24.415 --> 05:27.084
That's gonna be a hard no.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.120
*

05:32.890 --> 05:36.093
So, I got a bunch of ideas
about that restaurant concept.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.395
You know, savory cereal?

05:38.429 --> 05:41.065
Two words: Beefy Pebbles.

05:41.098 --> 05:43.700
We'll talk later.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.269
Ooh, excuse me?
Excuse me? Excuse me?

05:45.302 --> 05:47.171
SHITSTAIN:
Did-did you call him?

05:47.204 --> 05:49.573
HONEY NUTZ: Yes, I called him.
I can't believe he's late, man.

05:49.606 --> 05:52.676
I can. He's been the
worst best man ever.

05:52.709 --> 05:54.946
He lost the ring at the
Monterey Aquarium tide pool.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.413
Said a sea anemone
took it.

05:56.447 --> 05:58.182
Does that even sound
plausible to you?

05:58.215 --> 06:00.584
Do you know how slow
a sea anemone is?

06:00.617 --> 06:02.019
There he is.

06:02.053 --> 06:03.520
Where's the
navy suit?

06:03.554 --> 06:05.856
Oh, nah, blood, this is it.

06:05.889 --> 06:08.725
I just got the pants hemmed
and the jacket taken in.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.894
Then it still was
a total piece of shit,

06:10.928 --> 06:13.530
so I lit it on fire and bought
something dope instead.

06:13.564 --> 06:15.399
(groans) That's it!

06:15.432 --> 06:16.867
You're fired as best man.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.136
Nutz, you're giving
the toast tonight.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.737
Seriously?

06:20.771 --> 06:23.774
Okay, idiot, good luck
with this mush-mouth.

06:23.807 --> 06:25.476
Fool can't even leave
a simple voice mail.

06:25.509 --> 06:27.478
Always be like, "Uh...

06:27.511 --> 06:30.314
Call me back. Uh..." Click.

06:30.347 --> 06:32.984
Y-Yo, you know public speaking
is one of my greatest fears.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.485
It's public speaking,
heights and waking up

06:34.518 --> 06:35.953
with a scorpion
in my mouth.

06:35.987 --> 06:37.288
You'll be fine.

06:37.321 --> 06:38.822
We're professional
public speakers.

06:38.855 --> 06:40.257
That-that's different.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.493
Look, Honey Nutz is a persona.

06:42.526 --> 06:46.263
Uh, when I'm not rapping,
I'm just Zachary from Reseda,

06:46.297 --> 06:47.631
that likes hard cider

06:47.664 --> 06:50.001
and losing myself
in a graphic novel.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.902
(growls)

06:51.935 --> 06:53.470
I don't mean no
disrespect, by that.

06:53.504 --> 06:55.139
I don't, I don't.
I'm just saying...

06:56.140 --> 06:57.708
Oh!

07:00.144 --> 07:01.678
Nice look.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.181
Shouldn't you be trying
to shoot down Snoopy?

07:04.215 --> 07:07.084
I went a little crazy
with the purge.

07:07.118 --> 07:10.021
Got rid of all my outerwear
and my underwear.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.991
I'm currently wearing one
of Edgar's bathing suits.

07:14.025 --> 07:17.428
Jimmy, I've thought about
your pros and cons list,

07:17.461 --> 07:20.297
and I think it's only fair
that you show it to me.

07:20.331 --> 07:22.699
Gretchen, I'm undergoing

07:22.733 --> 07:26.503
a really painful process
of reevaluation.

07:26.537 --> 07:29.440
Now, if you could just
respect my privacy,

07:29.473 --> 07:31.675
I'd really
appreciate it.

07:31.708 --> 07:35.446
Fine, I hear you.
You have my word.

07:35.479 --> 07:36.880
Mm.

07:39.650 --> 07:40.617
Mm.

07:40.651 --> 07:42.319
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, a zipper!

07:42.353 --> 07:44.355
I can't get through that.
(laughs)

07:47.191 --> 07:48.959
Fine.

07:48.992 --> 07:51.695
I'm gonna go shake gifts, see
if anything sounds expensive.

07:54.165 --> 07:55.699
Jimmy.

07:55.732 --> 07:57.134
This is my wife, Jaclyn.

07:57.168 --> 07:58.135
Hi!

07:58.169 --> 07:59.670
(scoffs)

07:59.703 --> 08:02.005
What a dick.
Don't worry, he's an asshole.

08:02.039 --> 08:03.640
Priscilla!

08:03.674 --> 08:05.376
Oh, look at you!

08:05.409 --> 08:06.677
Oh. What do you think?
Amazing!

08:06.710 --> 08:07.911
Oh, thank you.

08:07.944 --> 08:09.546
MAN:
Shitstain in the house!

08:09.580 --> 08:11.348
I love weddings.

08:11.382 --> 08:12.849
Friends coming together.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.518
Old couples falling
in love again.

08:14.551 --> 08:16.653
Plus, you can totally
steal a chair at a wedding.

08:16.687 --> 08:18.522
I've done it so many times.

08:18.555 --> 08:21.092
Most of my chairs
are wedding chairs.
(phone vibrates)

08:21.125 --> 08:22.493
What's going on?

08:22.526 --> 08:24.428
Whoa. It's Doug Benson.

08:24.461 --> 08:27.998
He wants me to come up with
five sketch ideas by tomorrow.

08:28.031 --> 08:30.000
(exhales) Well...

08:30.033 --> 08:32.269
I guess I better
start brainstorming.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.337
Wait, you're gonna work
at a wedding?

08:34.371 --> 08:35.739
I don't have a
choice, Dorothy.

08:35.772 --> 08:37.874
I mean, this is a
huge opportunity.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.909
I-I got to nail it.

08:39.943 --> 08:41.678
Okay, let's see.

08:41.712 --> 08:43.746
Weddings, weddings.

08:43.780 --> 08:46.883
Bride. Groom. Broom.

08:48.252 --> 08:51.922
Here comes... the broom?

08:54.658 --> 08:56.026
Wow.

08:56.059 --> 08:58.429
This might not take
long after all.

08:58.462 --> 09:01.432
Cool. So just go do
your very important work,

09:01.465 --> 09:05.269
and I'll just wander around
by myself, like a loser.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.472
Hey! Lindsay!

09:09.473 --> 09:12.743
(groaning)

09:12.776 --> 09:14.211
He has a job.

09:14.245 --> 09:16.247
How'd he get that?

09:22.085 --> 09:24.988
SHITSTAIN: All right,
I fired him to hire you.

09:25.021 --> 09:27.224
These aren't your
words you're writing.

09:27.258 --> 09:29.760
What is that?
(sniffing)

09:34.765 --> 09:36.733
Hey. How'd you get that?

09:36.767 --> 09:37.968
What? (chuckles)

09:38.001 --> 09:41.405
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:41.438 --> 09:43.674
PRISCILLA:
Listen one more time.

09:43.707 --> 09:48.179
My client wants
100% ostrich feathers.

09:48.212 --> 09:51.315
I don't care. Just wait
until they stick their heads

09:51.348 --> 09:54.251
in the ground
and then slit their throats.

09:54.285 --> 09:55.986
Hey, how'd you get that?

09:56.019 --> 09:58.088
(chuckles) My job?

09:58.121 --> 10:00.324
Well, I started
a fashion blog.

10:00.357 --> 10:02.926
Then Tavi Gevinson
retweeted me.

10:02.959 --> 10:05.829
Then I dressed Parker Posey
for the Good Wife premiere.

10:05.862 --> 10:07.931
Before I knew it,
I was a stylist.

10:07.964 --> 10:10.167
I love your jacket,
by the way.
Thanks.

10:10.201 --> 10:12.503
My trick is I just buy
a cheap jacket,

10:12.536 --> 10:13.937
replace the buttons
with doper ones,

10:13.970 --> 10:15.772
and tell everyone
I got it in Italy.

10:15.806 --> 10:17.941
But not Little Italy.
The big Italy.

10:17.974 --> 10:20.711
That's brilliant.
(laughs)

10:20.744 --> 10:22.846
I really like your
pocket square, too.

10:22.879 --> 10:24.615
Thanks.
Those are my panties.

10:24.648 --> 10:26.116
(laughs)

10:26.149 --> 10:27.984
LINDSAY:
I'm not joking.

10:33.724 --> 10:35.025
Hey. What's up with you?

10:35.058 --> 10:36.360
Hi, Gretchen.

10:36.393 --> 10:37.894
SAM: Got fired
as the best man.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.630
Not that I care.

10:39.663 --> 10:41.965
Group's turning into a
bunch of pussies anyway!

10:41.998 --> 10:43.867
Honey Nutz is getting
his knuckles waxed

10:43.900 --> 10:46.036
for his appearance
on Poker After Dark.

10:46.069 --> 10:48.038
Shitstain getting married
with no thought

10:48.071 --> 10:50.374
to how it will affect
our careers.

10:50.407 --> 10:53.143
I ain't trying to rap
about kids or poker!

10:53.176 --> 10:55.512
Ain't nothing rhyme
with "poker."

10:57.047 --> 10:59.082
So what are you gonna do?

10:59.115 --> 11:01.385
What can I do? He went and
changed his whole life,

11:01.418 --> 11:03.186
and I don't even
got a say in it.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.855
Hey, you guys
are a team.

11:04.888 --> 11:06.857
If you feel like you're
losing control of your future,

11:06.890 --> 11:08.325
just talk to him.

11:08.359 --> 11:11.362
Your actions
affect each other.

11:11.395 --> 11:13.564
Yeah.

11:13.597 --> 11:16.667
My actions do
affect each other.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.902
I don't like how you just
repeated that verbatim

11:18.935 --> 11:20.737
with a glint in your eye,
but, yeah,

11:20.771 --> 11:24.375
you got to take charge
of your... future.

11:24.408 --> 11:26.377
Now you have the
glint, too, bitch.

11:26.410 --> 11:28.912
Bitch, I ain't got
no glint!

11:28.945 --> 11:30.947
*

11:39.155 --> 11:41.358
Okay, how's this
for a sketch idea?

11:41.392 --> 11:43.460
A guy who takes
everything literally.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.096
That's kind of the first sketch
that everybody comes up with.

11:46.129 --> 11:47.464
That or 50-hour Energy.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.601
Oh, man.
That'd be so much energy.

11:50.634 --> 11:53.103
(laughs)

11:53.136 --> 11:56.273
Hey, look.
It's Brian Posehn.

11:56.307 --> 11:59.209
(chuckles) That is
not Brian Posehn.

11:59.242 --> 12:01.278
I took tickets for Brian
Posehn's one-man show,

12:01.312 --> 12:02.579
like, a decade ago.

12:02.613 --> 12:04.881
I used to party with
all those comics.

12:04.915 --> 12:07.217
The one thing I know
is who is who in comedy,

12:07.250 --> 12:09.453
and I know that that
is not Brian Posehn.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.256
Oh. I guess it is him.

12:13.290 --> 12:14.391
Haircut.

12:14.425 --> 12:15.892
I should go talk to him.

12:15.926 --> 12:17.928
Maybe I could bounce
some ideas off him.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.400
Excuse me. Champagne?

12:23.434 --> 12:24.835
Oh.

12:28.839 --> 12:31.308
I'll leave it in the bathroom
later under the soap.

12:31.342 --> 12:33.076
Soap. (sniffing)

12:33.109 --> 12:35.111
(R&B music playing)

12:42.152 --> 12:44.154
Excuse me,
where's the restroom?

12:47.324 --> 12:48.925
Can I help you?

12:48.959 --> 12:51.127
Yeah, um, uh, my boyfriend

12:51.161 --> 12:53.930
left his heart attack
medication in his coat.

12:53.964 --> 12:55.999
Ugh.

12:57.334 --> 12:59.670
Yeah, do you have
a claim ticket?

12:59.703 --> 13:01.705
Uh, no, but...

13:01.738 --> 13:04.375
I got this.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.142
Ignore the bruise.

13:06.176 --> 13:09.145
Yeah, I just needed a ticket
to know which coat to get.

13:09.179 --> 13:12.749
Oh, uh, yeah. It's the
really ugly bomber jacket.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.561
Goddamn it.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.363
(growls)

13:26.397 --> 13:28.865
Okay.

13:28.899 --> 13:30.967
(groans)

13:31.001 --> 13:33.003
Hi.
(yelps)

13:35.706 --> 13:38.074
(clicks tongue)

13:38.108 --> 13:40.677
Fine. Two can play at that game.

13:40.711 --> 13:42.413
Yeah, whatever
you say, Gr...

13:42.446 --> 13:44.014
What? Hang on.
What are you doing?

13:44.047 --> 13:47.083
Um, I'm making a pros
and cons list about you.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.352
No. No. You
can't do that.

13:49.386 --> 13:51.154
Pros and cons list
is my thing.

13:51.187 --> 13:54.190
Oh, another con:
possessiveness of ideas.

13:55.859 --> 13:57.561
Right.

13:57.594 --> 13:58.862
Hey.

14:00.864 --> 14:02.899
Just to balance it out.

14:02.933 --> 14:04.935
*

14:15.646 --> 14:17.848
Hey. Congratulations.

14:17.881 --> 14:21.518
Thanks. Yeah, my parents thought
25 was young to get married,

14:21.552 --> 14:24.087
but when you know
you found the one...

14:24.120 --> 14:27.090
25? Wow, that's...
that's a good age.

14:27.123 --> 14:28.425
Mm.

14:28.459 --> 14:30.927
I tested for Ugly Betty
when I was 25.

14:30.961 --> 14:33.597
Who's Ugly Betty?

14:33.630 --> 14:35.432
I'm gonna go.

14:37.434 --> 14:40.003
Uh, that's actually
just for the bride...

14:42.405 --> 14:45.108
Oh. Listen.

14:45.141 --> 14:48.044
It's only fair I warn you what
you're getting into with us.

14:48.078 --> 14:50.413
Our lifestyle
is straight bananas.

14:50.447 --> 14:53.550
Touring, staying out late,
living off gum and Code Red.

14:53.584 --> 14:55.552
It can be rough
on bitches.

14:55.586 --> 14:56.620
Bitches?

14:56.653 --> 14:58.655
Oh. (chuckles)
On women.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.724
Yes, Sam, I know.
Don't worry.

15:00.757 --> 15:02.993
I am very pragmatic.

15:03.026 --> 15:05.962
You have to maintain a
certain image for the fans.

15:05.996 --> 15:07.297
Nothing will change.

15:07.330 --> 15:09.666
Okay, good.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.102
At least until
we have a baby.

15:12.135 --> 15:14.738
But we aren't planning
on starting a family

15:14.771 --> 15:16.473
until at least a year.

15:16.507 --> 15:18.308
A baby?

15:18.341 --> 15:20.811
A human-ass baby?

15:20.844 --> 15:23.079
Oh, man.

15:23.113 --> 15:25.649
Seems like just yesterday
we were skating on Fairfax,

15:25.682 --> 15:28.652
stealing leftovers from Orthodox
Jews coming out of Canter's.

15:28.685 --> 15:31.454
Now everything's
getting so serious.

15:31.488 --> 15:34.758
Sam, things change.

15:34.791 --> 15:38.461
I know it's scary,
but... you'll be okay.

15:39.530 --> 15:41.665
What the hell?!
What?

15:41.698 --> 15:44.167
Ugh! I can't believe
he just did that.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.136
Ugh. Dale! Dale!

15:46.169 --> 15:47.804
Shitstain!

15:47.838 --> 15:48.805
What happened?

15:48.839 --> 15:50.373
Sam tried to kiss me!

15:50.406 --> 15:52.042
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

15:52.075 --> 15:55.145
I'm sorry! I'm
just highly upset!

15:55.178 --> 15:57.147
This is all happening so fast.

15:57.180 --> 15:59.983
First, you settling down.
And as soon as someone agrees

16:00.016 --> 16:02.553
to go on a date with Zachary,
you know he gonna grab on tight

16:02.586 --> 16:03.987
and never let go.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

16:04.020 --> 16:05.488
Are you talking about
someone specific?

16:05.522 --> 16:07.123
Because if someone
has expressed interest,

16:07.157 --> 16:08.792
I'm available.
Look, if you're afraid

16:08.825 --> 16:11.528
that this is going to affect
our work, it's not.

16:11.562 --> 16:13.363
We signed
our million-year pledge.

16:13.396 --> 16:15.198
It ain't the work.

16:15.231 --> 16:18.068
I'm just...

16:18.101 --> 16:21.972
I'm just afraid I'm
losing my best friends.

16:22.005 --> 16:26.910
Sam, you're never going
to lose me as a friend.

16:26.943 --> 16:31.047
Look, why don't you and Zachary
give the speech together.

16:31.081 --> 16:33.249
Both of you
are my best men.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.051
Always will be.

16:35.085 --> 16:36.987
All right, man.

16:37.020 --> 16:39.089
Let's go work
on that speech.

16:39.122 --> 16:40.924
I go first, obviously.

16:43.193 --> 16:45.562
You know you can't be friends
with him anymore, right?

16:45.596 --> 16:47.230
Yeah, yeah, I know.

16:47.263 --> 16:48.732
Hey.

16:48.765 --> 16:52.235
Okay, so far, I have "takes
up too much room in bed,"

16:52.268 --> 16:54.237
"eats pizza with a fork."

16:54.270 --> 16:55.606
So you're making a list

16:55.639 --> 16:57.207
of dumb little negative things
about him?

16:57.240 --> 16:59.242
Yeah.

17:02.545 --> 17:04.513
Is this the dude
that wore the bomber jacket?

17:04.547 --> 17:05.749
That feels like one.

17:05.781 --> 17:08.284
(gasps)
Yes. Thank you.

17:10.954 --> 17:12.923
Hey. Alex said
you were gonna put the coke

17:12.955 --> 17:14.523
in the bathroom, man.
It's not there.

17:14.557 --> 17:17.426
What? I left it
under the soap.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.194
Dude, I bet you
Alex took it.

17:19.229 --> 17:21.031
Look, I'm not sure I
want to get involved

17:21.064 --> 17:24.233
in this cereal restaurant
thing if we can't trust him.

17:24.267 --> 17:25.935
(sniffs)

17:27.938 --> 17:29.873
EDGAR:
So, the guy's, like...

17:29.906 --> 17:32.075
(sighs)
"The boss is up my butt,"

17:32.108 --> 17:34.811
and our hero-- taking
everything literally, right?--

17:34.845 --> 17:36.780
puts his mouth
to the guy's butt,

17:36.813 --> 17:39.115
and he's like, "Are you
in there, Mr. Hendrickson?

17:39.149 --> 17:40.583
I'll save ya."

17:40.617 --> 17:43.386
(laughs)
That's hilarious, man.

17:43.419 --> 17:45.622
Hey! Brian!

17:45.656 --> 17:47.724
So good to
see you again.

17:47.758 --> 17:50.260
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

17:50.293 --> 17:51.795
Dorothy Durwood.

17:51.828 --> 17:53.630
We worked together
on your one-man show.

17:53.664 --> 17:54.998
I took tickets.

17:55.031 --> 17:56.967
Remember after that
one show at Birds,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.569
you dared me to eat an
entire rotisserie chicken

17:59.602 --> 18:01.304
and then I did?

18:01.337 --> 18:03.674
But then people kind of
felt sorry for me, and...

18:03.707 --> 18:05.508
it was kind of a
downer all told,

18:05.541 --> 18:07.678
and not ultimately
worth it, comedically.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.479
Right!

18:09.512 --> 18:10.747
Course.

18:10.781 --> 18:12.315
H-How's it going?

18:12.348 --> 18:13.850
(groans) Still
grinding away

18:13.884 --> 18:15.118
at the old improv.

18:15.151 --> 18:16.853
Been doing it, gosh,
like, a decade now.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.955
But, yeah, my boyfriend here,
he goes and does it

18:18.989 --> 18:21.624
for literally an hour
and gets a job, but...

18:21.658 --> 18:24.695
I've got chore monkey shifts,
so-- you know what that is?

18:24.728 --> 18:27.330
Someone literally pays you
just over minimum wage

18:27.363 --> 18:29.165
to clean out their fridge,
for an example,

18:29.199 --> 18:31.534
and, uh, if you're real lucky,
when you get there,

18:31.567 --> 18:33.203
it's your ex-boyfriend
from college.

18:33.236 --> 18:35.538
Hey, uh, how much
do I have to pay you

18:35.571 --> 18:37.273
to end this conversation?
(chuckles)

18:37.307 --> 18:38.809
(laughs)

18:38.842 --> 18:41.611
Uh, hey, why-why
don't I take you home?

18:41.644 --> 18:43.646
No. No, you're networking.

18:43.680 --> 18:44.881
Go network.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.183
D-Dorothy?

18:47.217 --> 18:49.786
That was rough. Sorry.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.322
Hey, uh, I found some
cocaine in the bathroom.

18:52.355 --> 18:53.890
Do you want some?

18:55.191 --> 18:56.592
Mm.

18:59.229 --> 19:01.397
PRISCILLA: (laughs)
You know, actually,

19:01.431 --> 19:03.633
I'm looking for an
assistant stylist.

19:03.666 --> 19:05.668
I've stylisted before!

19:05.702 --> 19:08.071
I-I dressed this rapper,
and we wrote a song

19:08.104 --> 19:11.174
and smoked a, um...
a professional job thingie.

19:11.207 --> 19:13.009
(both laugh)

19:13.043 --> 19:15.645
Well, I'd love to run through
a few questions with you.

19:15.678 --> 19:18.982
But you need to know that
there is travel required.

19:19.015 --> 19:21.384
You'd have to come
with me to Paris

19:21.417 --> 19:23.253
a couple of
times a year...

19:23.286 --> 19:24.988
(ringtone plays)
Oh. Sorry.

19:25.021 --> 19:26.689
Um, I'll be right back.

19:26.723 --> 19:28.358
Yeah.

19:28.391 --> 19:30.493
I don't know, you tell me:

19:30.526 --> 19:32.996
is an emu the same
thing as an ostrich?

19:33.029 --> 19:34.264
I'll wait.

19:34.297 --> 19:35.999
Can you believe this?

19:36.032 --> 19:37.700
Sweetie, I think
it's amazing

19:37.734 --> 19:39.836
that you want
to work, but...

19:39.870 --> 19:42.238
it's only ethical that you
tell her you're with child.

19:42.272 --> 19:44.274
Paul, this woman
dressed Porter Potty

19:44.307 --> 19:45.942
for The Good Li premiere

19:45.976 --> 19:47.911
after being retweeted
by Crabby Applepants.

19:47.944 --> 19:50.213
She likes me.
Let me handle this.

19:50.246 --> 19:52.282
PRISCILLA: (groans)
Sorry about that.

19:52.315 --> 19:55.185
Poachers can be
so unreliable.

19:55.218 --> 19:56.953
Anyway, tell me about you guys.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.289
Do you have any children?
Nope. (clears throat)

19:59.322 --> 20:00.857
(chuckles)
Um...

20:00.891 --> 20:02.692
well, that's not
entirely accurate.

20:02.725 --> 20:04.560
Do not take this
from me, Paul.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.897
It's entirely accurate.
(clears throat)

20:06.930 --> 20:09.966
Ma'am, despite my
wife's objections,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.535
I feel we have an
ethical obligation

20:12.568 --> 20:15.438
to inform you
of something.

20:15.471 --> 20:17.207
Lindsay's pregnant.
Oh?

20:17.240 --> 20:18.909
No, I'm not.

20:18.942 --> 20:21.778
(chuckles) Lindsay, I can't
let you mislead her.

20:21.812 --> 20:23.413
She's pregnant.

20:23.446 --> 20:26.382
No! I'm not pregnant, Paul.
There is no baby.

20:26.416 --> 20:28.251
I had an abortion.
(gasps)

20:28.284 --> 20:29.953
Lindsay, don't
lie to her.

20:29.986 --> 20:31.955
I'm not lying.
Gretchen drove me.

20:31.988 --> 20:34.224
There was a pie flight.
I talked to a sign lady.

20:34.257 --> 20:36.326
I did that.
Yeah. Hmm?

20:36.359 --> 20:38.428
Also, I'm leaving you.
(groans)

20:39.830 --> 20:42.298
So this is
the b Paris, right?

20:42.332 --> 20:44.434
The one with the bread?

20:44.467 --> 20:45.902
Uh...

20:45.936 --> 20:48.338
you guys seem like
you need some time alone.

20:48.371 --> 20:50.974
Why don't you call me
when you...

20:51.007 --> 20:53.143
figure all this out.

20:56.112 --> 20:58.314
Paul, are you okay?

20:59.515 --> 21:01.952
(soft, trembling breaths)

21:12.062 --> 21:14.164
I am allowed
to reassess my life.

21:14.197 --> 21:15.932
You have no say in it.

21:15.966 --> 21:17.767
So I'm just supposed
to wait around

21:17.800 --> 21:19.769
until you think I'm worthy
of being your girlfriend?

21:19.802 --> 21:21.371
That's bullshit, dude.

21:21.404 --> 21:24.040
Just tell me one of the
things on your list.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.843
Okay, fine. But only if
you tell me one of yours.

21:26.877 --> 21:28.845
(scoffs) Fine.

21:28.879 --> 21:31.614
(sighs):
Okay.

21:31.647 --> 21:33.984
"I can't see
having kids with her."

21:35.986 --> 21:37.753
Your turn.

21:42.192 --> 21:44.794
I'm afraid you'll
never be successful.

21:44.827 --> 21:47.563
All right, everybody,
quiet down. Quiet down.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.565
I'm Sam.
This is my boy Zachary.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.868
Now, we know why
we're here today.

21:51.902 --> 21:54.004
Dale and Jaclyn
went and eloped,

21:54.037 --> 21:56.406
because they were too cheap
to throw a proper wedding.

21:56.439 --> 21:58.174
(laughter)

21:58.208 --> 22:01.344
"Two people haven't
gotten married that fast

22:01.377 --> 22:05.248
since Immigration came
for my mom's gardener."

22:05.281 --> 22:06.983
(woman coughs quietly)

22:07.017 --> 22:09.185
It's true that this
courtship was kind of quick,

22:09.219 --> 22:10.887
but the thing is,

22:10.921 --> 22:14.324
when your shadow looks like
a broomstick with an afro,

22:14.357 --> 22:17.027
you lock down the first girl
that lets you touch her titties!

22:17.060 --> 22:18.594
(laughter)

22:18.628 --> 22:21.664
"This-this dude is so ugly...

22:21.697 --> 22:23.599
"his dad left his family

22:23.633 --> 22:26.269
and ask to go to jail."

22:26.302 --> 22:28.038
(chuckles)

22:28.071 --> 22:29.539
(man clears throat)

22:29.572 --> 22:32.008
(microphone feedback hums)
All joking aside,

22:32.042 --> 22:35.611
it may seem like they ain't
been dating that long,

22:35.645 --> 22:38.114
but when it's the person
you're meant to be with,

22:38.148 --> 22:40.183
you know right away.
(people aahing)

22:40.216 --> 22:42.118
And as you get
to know them,

22:42.152 --> 22:45.288
you only grow to
love them more.

22:45.321 --> 22:47.323
(whispers)

22:49.259 --> 22:50.693
Hey...

22:50.726 --> 22:53.729
uh, "Even if
it doesn't work out,

22:53.763 --> 22:58.101
we all got some wack-ass
ceviche out of it, right?"

22:58.134 --> 23:00.903
(laughter)
Ha! Ha-ha!

23:02.973 --> 23:03.974
Oh.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.275
(guitar playing mellow intro)

23:05.308 --> 23:07.310
Sorry about that kiss thing.
I apologize.

23:11.481 --> 23:14.317
I know he stole it.
He's the one.

23:14.350 --> 23:16.352
*

23:23.693 --> 23:27.998
* So go and drag your shadow

23:28.031 --> 23:30.833
* Back up the street

23:34.937 --> 23:38.608
* 'Cause Lord knows
I don't want it *

23:38.641 --> 23:41.444
* Following me

23:54.390 --> 23:57.127
* So you and your heartbreak

23:57.160 --> 23:59.762
* And all of the mistakes

23:59.795 --> 24:02.632
* Are always there...

24:02.665 --> 24:05.135
Oh. Right.

24:05.168 --> 24:07.437
* You got some heartache

24:07.470 --> 24:09.672
* Come meet all my mistakes

24:09.705 --> 24:12.542
* And we'll always be there

24:12.575 --> 24:14.610
* They're always there

24:14.644 --> 24:17.480
* So you and your heartbreak

24:17.513 --> 24:19.949
* And all of the mistakes

24:19.982 --> 24:22.718
* Are always there

24:22.752 --> 24:25.355
* They're always there

24:25.388 --> 24:27.657
* I've got some heartache

24:27.690 --> 24:30.193
* Come meet all my mistakes

24:30.226 --> 24:32.562
* And we'll always be there

24:32.595 --> 24:35.565
* They're always there

24:37.900 --> 24:40.236
* So I don't know

24:40.270 --> 24:44.006
* Why I feel so

24:44.040 --> 24:45.675
* Alone

24:45.708 --> 24:48.010
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

24:48.044 --> 24:51.013
* Oh, yeah, I don't know why

24:51.047 --> 24:53.349
* I feel so

24:53.383 --> 24:57.253
* Alone...

24:59.021 --> 25:01.524
* Oh, I don't know why

25:01.557 --> 25:03.526
* I feel so

25:03.559 --> 25:06.529
* Alone

25:06.562 --> 25:08.564
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

25:08.598 --> 25:10.900
* Oh, yeah, I don't know

25:10.933 --> 25:14.904
* Why I feel so alone.

25:19.041 --> 25:22.044
(dog barks)

25:24.980 --> 25:27.983
