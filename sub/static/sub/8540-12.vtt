WEBVTT

00:04.613 --> 00:05.657
The red light's on.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.485
T-that means
we're ready, yeah?

00:07.572 --> 00:09.052
'Yes.'

00:09.139 --> 00:11.185
Would you,
uh, tell us why and how

00:11.272 --> 00:13.317
a psychic
becomes a CBI agent?

00:13.404 --> 00:15.232
I'm not a psychic.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.755
No such things as psychics.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.366
And he's not a CBI agent.

00:18.453 --> 00:19.715
He's a consultant.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.456
Big difference.

00:21.543 --> 00:22.587
"No such thing as psychics."

00:22.674 --> 00:26.461
Uh, care to elaborate?

00:30.726 --> 00:32.684
Uh, no, not particularly.

00:32.771 --> 00:36.036
Um...you know what,
this-this is not..

00:36.123 --> 00:37.602
This is not a good idea,
I don't think..

00:37.689 --> 00:40.431
Um, not a good idea.

00:40.518 --> 00:41.737
[clears throat]
'Okay.'

00:41.824 --> 00:43.173
'Um, maybe we'll-we'll'

00:43.260 --> 00:44.566
'come back to that later.'

00:44.653 --> 00:47.699
'Uh, how do your
cases usually start?'

00:47.786 --> 00:50.050
Uh, a case begins with
us getting a phone call

00:50.137 --> 00:51.312
from the AG's office

00:51.399 --> 00:52.791
to lead an investigation.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.054
In the St. Clare homicide

00:54.141 --> 00:55.577
the local DA wanted us on it

00:55.664 --> 00:57.883
because there were
political issues involved.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.929
And how did
the local cops feel

01:00.016 --> 01:02.584
about your-your team
coming in?

01:02.671 --> 01:04.368
We get along extremely well

01:04.455 --> 01:07.676
with our local partners
in law enforcement, yes.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.418
My people can handle this,
no problem.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.333
California Bureau of
Interference is what you are.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.682
Interference?

01:13.769 --> 01:15.118
- That's witty.
- Stay out of this.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.338
I'm sure your people are
competent, Chief Donner.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.296
We're simply following
the AG's orders.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.863
Screw the AG.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.386
This case is going
to be in the news

01:22.473 --> 01:23.692
and you people are
spotlight hogs.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.433
- That's all.
- I assure you, chief--

01:25.520 --> 01:26.912
Don't waste your time,
his anger runs

01:26.999 --> 01:29.045
deeper than you can reach.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.742
Seriously,
don't start trouble here.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.135
It's the last
thing we need.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.485
The victim is
Martha St. Clare, 34.

01:34.572 --> 01:35.530
Media relations coordinator

01:35.617 --> 01:36.879
'for the mayor of this town.'

01:36.966 --> 01:37.880
Mayor was here
to break ground

01:37.967 --> 01:39.055
on a new development.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.361
Dug up her PR flack instead.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.710
Ouch.

01:41.797 --> 01:42.928
Yeah, victim was stabbed
twice in the chest

01:43.015 --> 01:44.060
but there's
no blood here.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.148
Killed elsewhere.

01:45.235 --> 01:46.671
Home.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.325
Her nails are done.
Her hair's done.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.197
This woman doesn't
wear sweatpants anywhere

01:50.284 --> 01:51.589
but at home.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.287
Cho, have Van Pelt
check it out.

01:53.374 --> 01:54.288
Yeah.

01:56.638 --> 01:58.727
The killer wanted
the body to be discovered here

01:58.814 --> 02:00.381
under the glare
of the cameras.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.644
And likely came here
to watch the fuss.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.167
Likely.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.126
Maybe the camera crews
caught something.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.953
We'll need to have
them look into it.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.259
[sniffing]

02:09.346 --> 02:10.869
There's bruises on her arms.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.480
Looks like something
was ripped off her neck

02:12.567 --> 02:14.090
during the struggle.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.831
Is he sniffing her?

02:15.918 --> 02:17.267
Yes.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.182
You pay him to sniff people?

02:19.269 --> 02:20.314
Apparently.

02:20.401 --> 02:23.055
She's been smoking.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.448
The nicotine
patch on her arm

02:24.535 --> 02:25.580
says she
was trying to quit.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.059
So under
stress of late.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.236
Well, case closed.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.107
Stress got a knife
and stabbed her to death.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.978
He's on a roll.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.023
You're on a roll.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.416
[sniffs]
Cheap soap.

02:35.503 --> 02:36.895
Unironed shirt.
Stomach pains.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.070
Recent loss of weight.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.855
I'm gonna
take a wild guess here.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.073
You're angry
and unhappy

02:41.161 --> 02:42.379
'cause you're
living in a motel

02:42.466 --> 02:43.728
because your wife
found out about the woman

02:43.815 --> 02:44.773
you're having
an affair with

02:44.860 --> 02:46.122
that you don't
even care for.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.950
You're a seething mass
of self-loathing

02:48.037 --> 02:49.212
and understandably so.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.346
You son of a bitch!

02:52.433 --> 02:53.825
Donner,
my apologies.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.740
He was completely
out of line.

02:55.827 --> 02:59.440
Let-let's just get
back to the body. Sir?

03:00.397 --> 03:03.139
[theme music]

03:13.105 --> 03:14.063
We've closed more cases

03:14.150 --> 03:15.934
than any other unit in the CBI.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.893
But we don't
keep score that way.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.025
It's not a contest.

03:20.112 --> 03:22.767
And you-you also...lead

03:22.854 --> 03:24.116
in the number of complaints

03:24.204 --> 03:26.641
'and lawsuits filed.'

03:27.729 --> 03:30.601
Okay, hold it.

03:30.688 --> 03:34.039
I thought we had an agreement.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.563
Brenda, a word.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.832
Jane's right.
This isn't a good idea.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.616
I thought this was supposed
to be positive coverage.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.096
It is! It will be.

03:47.183 --> 03:48.880
If we're open
and honest about the issues

03:48.967 --> 03:51.318
the positivity follows.
That's PR 101.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.449
We're trying to solve

03:52.536 --> 03:54.103
a woman's murder here, Brenda.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.279
We don't have time
to waste on PR.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.194
Teresa, you know that we have

03:58.281 --> 03:59.500
been crucified by the media

03:59.587 --> 04:01.197
ever since Bosco
and his team were killed

04:01.284 --> 04:02.938
'here in our own house.'

04:03.025 --> 04:04.113
'When KTQZ asked me'

04:04.200 --> 04:05.201
for access yesterday

04:05.288 --> 04:07.116
I jumped at it.

04:07.203 --> 04:10.075
And the deputy AG concurred.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.642
Who is this guy anyway?

04:11.729 --> 04:14.210
Totally legit,
TV investigative reporter

04:14.297 --> 04:15.864
'Mike Brewster.'

04:15.951 --> 04:19.302
He has been covering
the central valley for years.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.521
We need this.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.523
Teresa. Please.
Work with us.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.220
He stays out of my way.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.091
He can film in the office
and in the bullpen

04:26.178 --> 04:27.484
but not out in the field.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.007
Thank you.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.096
Seriously, thank you.

04:31.183 --> 04:33.185
You won't be sorry,
and it's a two-way street.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.101
Agent Lisbon, if there's
anything I can do for you.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.408
There is one thing.

04:38.495 --> 04:39.757
[Brewster]
Okay, so this is
the footage Steve and I

04:39.844 --> 04:40.932
grabbed of the groundbreaking.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.369
That's the mayor.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.284
'Melba, Walker, Shannon.'

04:44.371 --> 04:45.894
She plays up the folksy image

04:45.981 --> 04:47.635
but she'd be tough as nails,
if she needs to be.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.246
Nice shoes.
Chip?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.117
No, thanks. Who's the rich guy
next to the mayor?

04:52.204 --> 04:53.597
'Oh, that's Heaton Krupp.'

04:53.684 --> 04:54.990
He's the private
developer on the project.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.166
Off the record, a prize jerk.

04:57.253 --> 04:59.647
- Who are those people?
- 'Tree huggers.'

04:59.734 --> 05:01.736
'The project's going up on the
edge of some reclaimed land.'

05:01.823 --> 05:03.520
You mean protected wildlands.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.479
You say "potato."

05:05.566 --> 05:07.307
You have any other
footage of the crowds?

05:07.394 --> 05:08.786
Not really.
Other networks might.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.135
But gaining access
can be tricky.

05:10.222 --> 05:11.963
It'd be good to get
a different perspective.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.443
Cho, see if you can
get the footage.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.010
You got it.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.533
'Alright,
that's Wilson Fonteneau.'

05:16.620 --> 05:17.839
The mayor's flunky.

05:17.926 --> 05:21.321
And here comes the money shot.

05:31.635 --> 05:32.549
Oh.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.425
[button clicks]

05:38.512 --> 05:40.035
These are from
the victim's home.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.471
Besides the signs
of a scuffle

05:41.558 --> 05:42.603
the only thing that
seemed to be missing

05:42.690 --> 05:44.082
was the victim's laptop.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.693
The murderer
probably took it.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.085
Check out this necklace.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.352
From the photos, it looks
like she wore it a lot.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.005
You think it could have
made the mark on her neck?

05:54.092 --> 05:55.659
Could be, when you
go to the apartment

05:55.746 --> 05:57.052
do a targeted search.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.706
The necklace is long gone.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.925
My guess, killer
made a souvenir of it.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.058
- Go.
- Okay.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.407
Where we going?

06:04.494 --> 06:05.756
Mayor's office.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.805
I don't have any problem
being in charge, no.

06:10.892 --> 06:14.199
I mean, maybe,
at first for a while

06:14.286 --> 06:15.766
as a woman,
it was a challenge.

06:15.853 --> 06:19.727
But...the demands
of the job take over. Yeah.

06:19.814 --> 06:22.077
[Brewster]
'Tell me about your weekends.'

06:22.164 --> 06:24.253
You wanna know
what I do on my weekends?

06:24.340 --> 06:26.081
'Yeah.'

06:26.168 --> 06:28.910
Why do you want to know that?

06:28.997 --> 06:30.781
I mean, I have
no problem having a life.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.130
If that's what you mean.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.305
I don't know why anybody

06:33.393 --> 06:34.350
would say otherwise.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.526
If they do...say otherwise.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.876
Um, I'm...I'm sorry.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.704
What were we talking about?

06:40.791 --> 06:43.185
[theme music]

06:49.583 --> 06:51.062
Sorry for the delay.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.455
The mayor's just
finishing up another meeting.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.196
It's been
a crazy day around here.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.415
Can I help you?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.242
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thanks.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.506
[Lisbon]
'Mr. Fonteneau,
did you work closely'

06:59.593 --> 07:00.942
'with Martha St. Clare?'

07:01.029 --> 07:03.118
For 16 months.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.598
Martha hired me,
actually.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.991
We noticed in a lot
of recent photographs

07:07.078 --> 07:08.732
that she had
a-a necklace on

07:08.819 --> 07:10.168
with a beautiful stone.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.301
Yes, a topaz, I think.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.563
It was her birthstone.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.130
She got it
Christmas of last year

07:15.217 --> 07:16.218
and never took it off.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.611
Do you know
who gave it to her?

07:17.698 --> 07:19.090
- No.
- She had a lot of meetings.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.570
Even on weekends.

07:20.657 --> 07:23.312
Business interests,
community groups, book club.

07:23.399 --> 07:24.922
Tomorrow is a big day.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.795
She has a star and three
exclamation marks at eleven.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.013
Yes.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.233
Uh, she scheduled
a briefing

07:31.320 --> 07:32.495
with the city council.

07:32.582 --> 07:33.757
On what subject?

07:33.844 --> 07:35.237
I don't know,
to be honest.

07:35.324 --> 07:36.934
The mayor will know.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.806
Was she dating anyone?

07:38.893 --> 07:41.243
A social life? Martha?

07:41.330 --> 07:42.940
No, she had a cat.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.855
Ah. Yes.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.770
But it died.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.076
Right.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.991
Excuse me.
Are you the CBI agents?

07:50.078 --> 07:51.427
Mayor, thank you
for seeing us.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.429
Happy to help,
and please call me Melba.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.387
Like the toast?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.302
Just like.
This way.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.223
Can you tell us about
your construction project

08:05.310 --> 08:06.703
that you were
opening yesterday?

08:06.790 --> 08:08.836
It's the Granton Complex.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.707
Yes, we areveryproud of it.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.840
'It's office and retail space'

08:12.927 --> 08:14.624
'plus housing, all built'

08:14.711 --> 08:16.974
with the latest
green technology.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.281
And what was Martha's
involvement in the project?

08:19.368 --> 08:22.719
None, really, she..

08:22.806 --> 08:24.199
...she was my..

08:24.286 --> 08:25.243
...media liaison.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.680
She was not engaged

08:26.767 --> 08:28.943
in policy issues.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.161
Then what
was she gonna talk

08:30.248 --> 08:32.729
about at city council tomorrow?

08:32.816 --> 08:34.470
Oh, a press junket.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.951
It was river rafting,
I believe.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.387
'Chief Donner says your office'

08:38.474 --> 08:39.780
has received several threats

08:39.867 --> 08:41.042
from environmental activists.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.217
Activists?

08:42.304 --> 08:44.001
No, they're terrorists.

08:44.088 --> 08:46.787
They burned down vacation
condos up on the mountain.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.703
'They destroyed luxury car
lots just one town over.'

08:49.790 --> 08:52.923
They're led by a madman,
and he calls himself Jasper.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.577
- Uh..
- Excuse me.

08:57.319 --> 08:59.713
Wilson, anything else can wait.

09:05.501 --> 09:06.676
- The threats?
- 'Yes.'

09:06.763 --> 09:07.895
'Um..'

09:12.029 --> 09:16.207
The Granton development
is an abomination.

09:16.294 --> 09:20.211
'A hundred acres
of pristine wildlands razed.'

09:20.298 --> 09:22.344
'An entire
ecosystem endangered.'

09:22.431 --> 09:24.259
It must stop.

09:24.346 --> 09:28.219
It will stop, no matter
what needs to be done.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.918
My name is Jasper..

09:31.005 --> 09:34.138
...and I am legion.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.923
[chuckling]
Come on.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.012
"I am legion."
That's just silly.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.970
- Silly?
- Yeah.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.015
He murdered Martha.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.103
Well, you assume.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.583
Yes, I do.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.759
The body was buried
at the site, for God's sake.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.108
And that is
a clear message.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.413
Isn't it?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.198
Melba..

09:50.285 --> 09:52.287
...why would
he kill Martha..

09:52.374 --> 09:53.462
...and not kill you?

09:53.549 --> 09:56.247
It'd be a bigger
publicity coup.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.335
Excuse me?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.511
What Mr. Jane
is trying to ask

09:59.599 --> 10:01.296
is whether there was
somebody with a more

10:01.383 --> 10:03.124
direct personal
grudge against Martha.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.821
- Mm.
- Yeah.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.170
No.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.042
She was a lovely..

10:08.129 --> 10:09.565
...was a lovely person.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.480
Oh, then why did you
dislike her so much?

10:11.567 --> 10:14.657
I didn't dislike Martha.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.920
Why would I employ
someone that...I don't like?

10:17.007 --> 10:18.400
Well, that's
a very good question.

10:18.487 --> 10:19.836
When you said it,
your jaw tensed

10:19.923 --> 10:21.185
and your eyes went
empty like a cobra.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.970
Wilson!

10:23.057 --> 10:24.275
I'm not saying you killed her,
I'm just saying

10:24.362 --> 10:25.625
that you're relieved
that she's dead.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.409
These people
will be leaving now.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.802
I like the way
you say that.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.630
Melba like the toast,
so tough and commanding.

10:30.717 --> 10:31.848
Now, let me tell you something.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.633
We are state
law enforcement

10:33.720 --> 10:35.025
and we leave
when we want to leave.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.331
Thank you for your time.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.289
She wants to leave.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.379
See you.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.994
You blew my cool.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.213
I swear, sometimes
I think you need medication.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.867
It's like you've got
ADD or something.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.086
Well, "A,"
I'm not so sure that

10:52.173 --> 10:53.609
ADD even exists

10:53.696 --> 10:55.611
and "B," I was winding
her up for a reason.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.482
- Which is?
- A diversion.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.136
The message the aide
brought in made her nervous.

10:59.223 --> 11:00.790
- So I took it.
- You're stealing now?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.531
Well, let's just
call it purloining.

11:02.618 --> 11:03.619
What does it say?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.839
It says,
"Your 3 o'clock meeting

11:05.926 --> 11:07.449
has now
been moved to 3:15."

11:07.536 --> 11:08.537
I'm just kidding.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.452
It says,
"911. Call now.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.846
"Urgent. About Martha.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.456
From Heaton Krupp."

11:14.543 --> 11:16.414
The developer
of the Granton Project.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.114
Oh, yeah.

11:20.201 --> 11:23.291
[Brewster]
'Do you enjoy police work?'

11:23.378 --> 11:24.858
Mm..

11:28.600 --> 11:30.167
'Patrick?'

11:30.254 --> 11:31.386
Uh, yeah, I'm thinking.

11:31.473 --> 11:32.474
Uh..

11:33.954 --> 11:35.346
Yes and no.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.088
Uh, yeah, sometimes.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.047
Sometimes not.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.745
Forget it, Steve.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.225
Why do you so dislike
being filmed?

11:44.312 --> 11:45.530
Uh..

11:47.924 --> 11:50.666
'Cause you're
stealing my soul.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.844
So I called the mayor.
So what?

11:54.931 --> 11:57.455
I'm building a $20 million
complex in her town.

11:57.542 --> 11:58.805
I call her a lot.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.284
About Ms. St. Clare?

12:00.371 --> 12:03.287
About when I can start
construction again.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.072
This is costing me hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.465
It cost
Ms. St. Clare a lot more.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.076
And I'm sorry about that.

12:09.163 --> 12:13.123
I am. But there's nothing
I can do about it.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.951
Martha would have
wanted us to go on.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.431
You knew her
well enough to know that?

12:16.518 --> 12:19.260
You're right.
I'm being pious.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.175
Maybe Martha would
have said, "Screw it."

12:21.262 --> 12:23.046
I knew her not at all
outside of business.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.832
Really? 'Cause we just got
her cellphone records

12:25.919 --> 12:27.703
and you called her
ten times yesterday.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.618
Wanna tell us what you wanted to
talk about so urgently?

12:29.705 --> 12:31.533
Seems I should get my lawyer.
Have him sit in with us.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.708
Sure. That's your right.

12:32.795 --> 12:33.927
Tell him
to bring all your

12:34.014 --> 12:35.189
permits for
the Granton Project.

12:35.276 --> 12:37.060
- My permits? Why?
- Why not?

12:37.147 --> 12:38.845
And we should make sure this
stays an active crime scene.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.020
Keep everyone out
until the case is solved.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.151
It could take weeks.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.936
See..

12:43.023 --> 12:44.807
We were talking
about money, okay?

12:44.894 --> 12:46.417
Ten million dollars
of public funds

12:46.504 --> 12:48.419
was to be released
when we broke ground.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.291
Then I heard rumors
that St. Clare

12:50.378 --> 12:52.728
was planning to tell the city
council to withhold them.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.600
- Why?
- I don't know!

12:55.687 --> 12:56.863
I mean, that's what
I was trying to find out.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.342
But St. Clare
was killed before

12:58.429 --> 12:59.343
she could talk
to the city council.

12:59.430 --> 13:00.867
Yes, but--

13:00.954 --> 13:02.216
So the $10 million will
come to you after all.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.305
What are you trying to
lay this on me?

13:04.392 --> 13:06.176
Because you're messing
with the wrong guy, officer!

13:06.263 --> 13:07.612
We're not officers.
We're agents.

13:07.699 --> 13:08.657
That's quite
a temper you got there.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.267
[glass shatters]

13:10.354 --> 13:11.660
Look out!

13:11.747 --> 13:14.532
Ah! My leg!

13:14.619 --> 13:15.969
- Grab him.
- Get down!

13:16.056 --> 13:17.405
Get on the floor!

13:17.492 --> 13:18.580
[shouting]

13:18.667 --> 13:20.408
Put it out!
Put it out!

13:20.495 --> 13:21.713
Wayne, put it out.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.150
Get the door!
Go, go, go, go!

13:23.237 --> 13:25.935
- Hang on!
- I got the door!

13:26.022 --> 13:26.936
[grunting]

13:28.198 --> 13:30.635
- Ah!
- You're fine.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.289
It's jammed!

13:32.376 --> 13:33.638
I got you.

13:33.725 --> 13:34.683
[glass shatters]

13:38.818 --> 13:39.819
[coughs]

13:45.259 --> 13:46.042
[grunting]

13:49.350 --> 13:52.048
[all coughing]

14:08.282 --> 14:09.239
This was done
by someone who knew

14:09.326 --> 14:10.284
what he or she was doing.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.895
[coughing]
Crackpot Jasper.

14:12.982 --> 14:15.202
He's a terrorist
and you ain't doing jack

14:15.289 --> 14:18.118
to catch him, chief.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.729
I'm in charge of the town
of Salter, Mr. Krupp.

14:20.816 --> 14:24.211
Not the outlying areas.

14:24.298 --> 14:25.560
Jasper's never
launched an attack here

14:25.647 --> 14:26.604
in town before.

14:26.691 --> 14:27.649
Until now.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.781
Hey! Check this out.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.966
Apparently, this is
the same tag that Jasper

14:40.053 --> 14:43.665
used in the attack
on the condos.

14:45.754 --> 14:46.929
This good, sir?

14:47.016 --> 14:47.974
[Brewster]
'It's great.'

14:48.061 --> 14:49.627
Uh, I've been
in fires before.

14:49.714 --> 14:52.239
I worked with the,
uh, Arson Squad in San Diego

14:52.326 --> 14:54.415
for a couple years, so..

14:54.502 --> 14:56.504
...I'm not unfamiliar
with the issues.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.636
It's never pleasant, though.

14:58.723 --> 15:01.378
Um...I mean, when you're,
when you're in it

15:01.465 --> 15:03.032
it's-there's no
time to think.

15:03.119 --> 15:07.036
But...but afterwards, well..

15:07.123 --> 15:09.299
...yeah.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.998
It can make you think.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.870
There was a..

15:14.957 --> 15:18.874
There was a moment
there, where, uh..

15:18.961 --> 15:20.093
[rattling]

15:21.833 --> 15:24.706
Yeah, makes you think.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.188
It's a gift, isn't it?

15:28.275 --> 15:30.973
Life.

15:31.060 --> 15:34.281
You should be
grateful for it.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.283
Make the most of it.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.502
We have to catch this guy
before he kills someone else.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.461
He hasn't killed anyone yet.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.158
- Not Martha St. Clare?
- Nah.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.204
Martha St. Clare was about
to stall the development.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.119
That exactly what Jasper
wants. So why kill her?

15:46.206 --> 15:48.512
[Lisbon]
'Maybe he didn't
know Martha's intentions.'

15:48.599 --> 15:52.429
But the mayor must have known.
Let's go see her.

15:52.516 --> 15:55.084
Yeah. You guys look
into this Jasper character.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.868
Don't bother.
He's a red herring.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.435
What does that mean,
anyway, a red herring?

15:58.522 --> 16:00.220
A red herring
is what you look into

16:00.307 --> 16:02.700
regardless
of what Jane tells you.

16:02.787 --> 16:03.919
Anything on
the networks' footage?

16:04.006 --> 16:05.181
They've been
throwing up hurdles.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.053
Something about
first amendment issues.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.272
Get the footage. I'm tired
of hearing their excuses.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.318
We ID somebody in the crowd,
maybe we get lucky.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.102
Yes, boss.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.017
Why am I a detective?
Why are you a reporter?

16:15.104 --> 16:16.366
[Brewster]
'What?'

16:16.453 --> 16:17.977
Why are you making
this documentary?

16:18.064 --> 16:19.630
'It's a fresh perspective
on law enforcement.'

16:19.717 --> 16:21.589
No, I mean,
what's in it for you?

16:21.676 --> 16:23.678
'Well, uh,
scoring this exclusive'

16:23.765 --> 16:25.201
'is a good way
to get noticed.'

16:25.288 --> 16:26.594
So you're ambitious.

16:26.681 --> 16:27.856
How long you been
doing the news here?

16:27.943 --> 16:29.379
- 'About eight years.'
- Anchor?

16:29.466 --> 16:30.902
'Mostly fieldwork.'

16:30.990 --> 16:34.558
So you're ambitious,
but you haven't gotten very far.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.734
I, uh, I guess
that's about it, yeah.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.084
'Uh, you don't like'

16:38.171 --> 16:39.215
being asked
questions, do you?

16:39.302 --> 16:40.434
The team as a whole

16:40.521 --> 16:42.218
seems to have
a problem with that.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.480
Is that a question?

16:43.567 --> 16:46.005
Mike, if I can
interrupt here?

16:46.092 --> 16:47.571
- Yeah.
- We're clear.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.617
Uh, there's coffee
in the kitchen, John.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.358
I'm so sorry.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.188
- Agent Cho?
- Yeah?

16:55.275 --> 16:58.495
It is the specific
request of the deputy AG

16:58.582 --> 17:00.671
that your unit cooperate
fully with the media.

17:00.758 --> 17:01.846
What's your point?

17:01.933 --> 17:03.761
[coughs]

17:03.848 --> 17:05.024
[Rigsby clears throat]

17:05.633 --> 17:06.808
Oh.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.689
Mayor Shannon,
we need to talk.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.909
Of course. I have a meeting.
Please make it fast.

17:20.996 --> 17:21.953
Sure, how big
was your bribe

17:22.041 --> 17:23.477
from Heaton Krupp?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.308
That is an outrageous slander.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.832
You sold your approval
of the Granton Project.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.486
Martha found out,
she was gonna reveal it

17:32.573 --> 17:33.617
at the city
council meeting

17:33.704 --> 17:34.749
which you said
was gonna be

17:34.836 --> 17:37.273
about river rafting,
of all things.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.189
River rafting,
from where did you pull that?

17:40.276 --> 17:43.018
You better have
really good personal lawyers.

17:43.105 --> 17:46.413
If you pursue this
absurd line of harassment

17:46.500 --> 17:47.762
I will hang you
by your heels.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.024
Did you get
a slice, too?

17:49.111 --> 17:50.895
Or are you
strictly wage labor?

17:50.982 --> 17:52.506
Your superiors will hear
from our lawyers.

17:52.593 --> 17:53.898
Oh, don't bother
with lawyers.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.378
It's such a waste
of taxpayer dollars.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.380
Just confess.
You'll feel a lot better.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.688
In actuality, you have no proof
of this so-called bribery.

18:00.775 --> 18:01.819
Uh, none at all.

18:03.647 --> 18:06.389
Are all CBI agents
this incompetent?

18:06.476 --> 18:09.131
Have you even bothered to check
her lover as a suspect?

18:09.218 --> 18:11.394
First you say it was Jasper.
Now it's the lover that did it.

18:11.481 --> 18:12.917
- You gonna make up your mind?
- What lover?

18:13.004 --> 18:14.919
We understood
she had no social life.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.704
I didn't know she did.

18:16.791 --> 18:20.316
Oh, well, she did, and competent
police would have known that.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.623
Why didn't you tell us
this earlier?

18:22.710 --> 18:26.061
Why don't I just do your job
foryou? How would that be?

18:26.148 --> 18:27.976
Oh, just please arrest her
or something.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.152
Nothing to hold her on.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.414
Eh.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.590
Eh.

18:35.505 --> 18:38.465
I'm the rookie on the team.

18:38.552 --> 18:42.425
Been here...18 months now.

18:42.512 --> 18:45.472
Um, it's hard work

18:45.559 --> 18:49.606
but this has been my dream
ever since I was a kid.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.782
To be a detective.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.915
'And what's been
the most surprising thing'

18:54.002 --> 18:56.352
'you've learned
about this job you do?'

18:59.181 --> 19:00.487
I've..

19:00.574 --> 19:04.404
...learned a lot about myself.

19:04.491 --> 19:08.712
As well as, about other people.

19:08.799 --> 19:12.586
Stuff...I wish
I didn't know sometimes.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.110
'Stuff like..'

19:15.197 --> 19:19.027
Why people do bad things
to one another.

19:19.114 --> 19:22.639
It's mainly because of secrets.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.773
Trying to hide the truth
chips away at your spirit.

19:25.860 --> 19:29.342
Secrets ruin relationships.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.300
We finally got the footage from
every news station

19:31.387 --> 19:33.172
covering
the groundbreaking ceremony.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.086
Apparently, threats work.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.306
These are two separate
vantage points of the mayor

19:37.393 --> 19:41.571
and these are feeds
of the crowd. There, that guy.

19:41.658 --> 19:44.357
[Lisbon]
'Can you narrow it down for us?
There's, like, 50 guys there.'

19:44.444 --> 19:46.837
The guy in the crowd there after
the mayor digs up the victim.

19:46.924 --> 19:49.405
He certainly doesn't
look like he fits in.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.451
"J."
That's bold.

19:51.538 --> 19:54.105
- A Jasper acolyte.
- Or the man himself.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.586
Get with the local PD.
See if they can identify him.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.505
- 'What is it?'
- Nothing. Just hungry.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.559
So we went back
to St. Clare's apartment

20:12.646 --> 20:13.777
went through her closet
and realized

20:13.864 --> 20:15.388
that some of her work shirts--

20:15.475 --> 20:17.564
- Button on the right.
- Yeah, and not her size.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.043
So the mayor was right.
She did have a lover.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.915
Of course she had a lover.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.004
That necklace she always wore
was obviously a romantic gift.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.875
She'd never spend
that kind of money on herself.

20:24.962 --> 20:27.138
Now you say so.
Very wise in hindsight.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.662
Well, I thought
it went without saying.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.968
It's horribly obvious when
people are in a relationship

20:31.055 --> 20:34.885
impossible to hide,
try though they might.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.278
She was a very attractive woman.

20:36.365 --> 20:39.107
I would not be surprised
if she had two lovers.

20:39.194 --> 20:41.501
There is nothing here.
I'm gonna go out for lunch.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.897
Turn that thing off, or I will
shove it down your throat.

20:46.984 --> 20:49.987
Let's take a walk,
shall we? Come on.

21:01.695 --> 21:04.263
I know it hasn't been
the most pleasant experience

21:04.350 --> 21:06.265
having a camera crew here.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.571
But you gotta cooperate.
Deputy AG's orders.

21:08.658 --> 21:09.833
Yeah.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.662
So what's the deal?

21:12.749 --> 21:14.969
I would think out of everybody
you'd be the most comfortable

21:15.056 --> 21:16.318
with the cameras.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.933
Last time I was
in front of a camera

21:23.020 --> 21:25.588
things, uh,
didn't turn out so well.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.897
Oh, God, Jane, I'm sorry.

21:29.984 --> 21:32.552
You don't need to be sorry.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.467
And you're right.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.904
There's no reason not to be
civil. I'm going to apologize.

21:42.779 --> 21:46.174
Hey, I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to be intrusive.

21:46.261 --> 21:48.698
No, I-I shouldn't
have snapped at you.

21:48.785 --> 21:53.050
I'm sorry. I just...I don't
like feeling spied on.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.183
It's my own little neurosis.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.489
You're just doing
your job, right?

21:56.576 --> 21:57.751
Right.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.666
Well, let me buy you a taco.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.276
- Sure.
- I know you're in.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.973
- I am kind of hungry.
- Well, that's the spirit.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.932
I know the perfect place.
Vamonos.

22:09.284 --> 22:10.546
Muchas gracias.

22:13.462 --> 22:14.942
- Mike.
- Thank you.

22:15.029 --> 22:18.032
Steve. So tell me about
news gathering.

22:20.164 --> 22:21.862
Out of my way!

22:21.949 --> 22:23.733
Whoa! Whoa!

22:25.039 --> 22:26.170
[crowd screaming]

22:35.092 --> 22:37.486
Did you get that?
Did you get it?

22:42.839 --> 22:44.101
Keep moving.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.499
Let's go.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.025
I don't know where we're going,
but I hope there's a bathroom.

22:57.027 --> 22:58.420
I am busting.

22:59.682 --> 23:00.596
Oh.

23:02.511 --> 23:03.425
[chatter]

23:06.863 --> 23:07.821
Definitely Jasper.

23:07.908 --> 23:08.996
The description of the van

23:09.083 --> 23:10.519
matches one seen
near the condo fire

23:10.606 --> 23:12.391
and the luxury car lot
Jasper destroyed.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.610
How long has Chief Donner
had this information?

23:14.697 --> 23:15.872
Contact the local
and the county PD.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.265
On it.

23:17.352 --> 23:18.527
We got a hit on
the Jasper associate

23:18.614 --> 23:19.876
at the groundbreaking ceremony.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.400
Local activists
draw the line at kidnapping.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.184
- They gave this guy up fast.
- Bart Henrik.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.752
On his blog, he calls himself
a green warrior.

23:25.839 --> 23:27.928
He's been arrested several times
for inciting a riot

23:28.015 --> 23:29.886
public disorder and vandalism.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.627
- Go find him. Take Rigsby.
- You got it.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.815
Watch your step.

24:12.363 --> 24:13.626
I can see you mean business.

24:13.713 --> 24:15.192
Uh, there's no need
for firearms.

24:15.279 --> 24:16.759
I'm not Harry Houdini.

24:16.846 --> 24:17.760
Quiet.

24:20.371 --> 24:21.721
Thank you.

24:23.418 --> 24:24.767
So you're Jasper.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.075
Well, I'm honored.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.036
Please don't say
you kidnapped me for ransom

24:33.123 --> 24:36.300
because I-I doubt you'll get
$50, let alone save the whales.

24:36.387 --> 24:40.174
No ransom. In actuality,
just a simple message.

24:40.261 --> 24:42.306
I did not kill
Martha St. Clare

24:42.393 --> 24:45.353
and I didn't throw that
firebomb in Krupp's office.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.051
Now, you, you are gonna
tell that to the police

24:48.138 --> 24:50.010
and to the media.

24:50.097 --> 24:52.578
So you kidnapped me
to proclaim your innocence.

24:52.665 --> 24:55.668
Have you ever heard
of a phone?

24:55.755 --> 24:57.844
Oh, yeah. I see.

24:57.931 --> 25:00.368
If you kidnap me
and I pass on the message

25:00.455 --> 25:03.110
then you get a blast of
that publicity that you love.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.503
If I am branded a killer

25:04.590 --> 25:07.680
everything I have fought
for is discredited.

25:07.767 --> 25:11.031
People support me because I have
respect for all living things.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.773
Yes, but it's
a good rule of thumb

25:13.860 --> 25:17.298
to avoid doing things
that require you to wear a mask.

25:17.385 --> 25:19.779
And you're such a
handsome fellow, too.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.828
How'd you know
I'm handsome?

25:25.915 --> 25:27.569
Well, I was just speaking
figuratively.

25:27.656 --> 25:28.831
No, you weren't.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.792
- You know who I am.
- No, I have no idea.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.882
Leave us
and don't come back.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.448
'No, he doesn't have
to go anywhere.'

25:37.536 --> 25:39.929
I-I-I.. Will you listen to me?
I have no idea.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.757
You could be Elvis Presley,
for all I know.

25:41.844 --> 25:43.237
- 'How did you know?'
- I don't know.

25:43.324 --> 25:44.543
How did you..

25:46.370 --> 25:48.285
Please don't do that.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.732
How did you know?

26:04.867 --> 26:07.740
Well, what's not to know?

26:07.827 --> 26:09.698
Your height,
your body language.

26:11.091 --> 26:12.483
Your syntax.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.094
You said "in actuality."

26:14.181 --> 26:16.357
I mean, who-who says
"in actuality?"

26:18.664 --> 26:19.795
Yes.

26:19.882 --> 26:20.796
Yeah.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.233
Very clever.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.934
So now we have a problem.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.555
Get that thing out of my face!

26:54.177 --> 26:55.439
Jasper kidnapped our colleague.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.441
- Where are they?
- Jasper who?

26:57.528 --> 26:58.529
Did you know you can
get more time

26:58.617 --> 27:00.531
for kidnapping
than murder?

27:00.619 --> 27:01.707
That's crazy, right?

27:01.794 --> 27:02.838
And being an accessory
after the fact

27:02.925 --> 27:04.535
makes you just as guilty
as Jasper.

27:07.756 --> 27:10.716
Man, Jasper's avenging
Mother Earth. That's all.

27:10.803 --> 27:11.978
You know him well enough
to be sure of his motives.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.588
Yes.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.242
You know him so well you can
tell us where he might be.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.636
Even if I knew,
which I don't

27:17.723 --> 27:19.550
I would never betray Jasper.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.465
- Never is a big word.
- Try me.

27:21.552 --> 27:24.033
What would Jane want us
to do in this situation, Cho?

27:24.120 --> 27:25.556
With his life in jeopardy?

27:25.644 --> 27:26.645
You know what
he'd want us to do.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.516
Yep. Okay.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.954
I guess we have to go.
There.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.222
We should call an ambulance.
It's procedure.

27:39.309 --> 27:40.659
Sure. They can set it fast
and we can get

27:40.746 --> 27:41.703
straight back to questioning.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.618
Wait. Set what?

27:43.705 --> 27:45.141
[clanks]

27:45.228 --> 27:47.796
Your arm, you broke it,
slipped on the stairs.

27:47.883 --> 27:49.580
Yeah, you should
be more careful, Henrik.

27:49.668 --> 27:53.149
Hey. Hey, a bunch of people
saw me come in here, fine.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.195
A bunch of cops,
and I'm one of them.

27:55.282 --> 27:57.023
I saw you fall.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.460
And every cop in this building
will say exactly the same.

28:00.504 --> 28:01.462
[thud]

28:13.169 --> 28:14.605
A cabin in the Sierra Foothills.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.129
Ten miles northeast of Salter.

28:16.216 --> 28:17.565
Nice work.

28:20.176 --> 28:21.787
What to do?

28:21.874 --> 28:23.179
What to do?

28:23.266 --> 28:25.442
If I let you go now,
you'll rat me out.

28:25.529 --> 28:27.923
- If I may make a suggestion?
- No, you may not.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.319
Please, Wilson,
I can help.

28:32.406 --> 28:33.755
I cannot go to prison.

28:35.975 --> 28:38.020
I need to finish my work.
Don't you see?

28:38.107 --> 28:41.110
I do, I see, your work
is very important.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.678
But what I don't
understand though

28:43.765 --> 28:45.767
is why you were working
in the mayor's office.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.029
Where better
to study the enemy

28:47.116 --> 28:48.596
than from within
their very camp?

28:48.683 --> 28:50.076
Did you know that the mayor
was taking bribes

28:50.163 --> 28:51.817
from the developer Krupp?

28:51.904 --> 28:53.557
Of course.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.255
Who do you think
put Martha onto it?

28:55.342 --> 28:57.213
Ah. You told her.

28:59.128 --> 29:02.523
But why not expose the mayor
yourself or do it as Jasper?

29:02.610 --> 29:05.178
They would know that Jasper
was inside the mayor's office.

29:05.265 --> 29:07.615
They would soon suspect me.

29:07.702 --> 29:10.705
I work in the shadows,
that's why I am still here.

29:10.792 --> 29:11.880
Still fighting.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.360
I understand.

29:14.404 --> 29:15.797
Let me help you.

29:15.884 --> 29:17.973
Don't try to play me.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.410
Don't go saying you won't tell
on me if I set you free

29:20.497 --> 29:21.672
because I know you will.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.327
Wilson, I am not trying
to play you.

29:24.414 --> 29:27.069
I will not play you.

29:27.156 --> 29:29.855
I understand and respect
your intelligence.

29:31.508 --> 29:32.858
Have a seat.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.208
Just take a moment.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.922
Wilson, look at me.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.055
I can help you.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.321
How?

30:01.408 --> 30:03.802
Look at me.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.804
You can see that
I'm telling the truth.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.200
I want what you want.

30:12.419 --> 30:13.986
Peace and harmony.

30:15.683 --> 30:16.989
'Peace..'

30:18.425 --> 30:19.382
...quiet.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.344
It's easy.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.824
You can have it.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.872
'If you want it,
you can have it.'

30:33.919 --> 30:35.355
So peaceful.

30:38.314 --> 30:41.622
'This is Chief Donner of
the Salter Police Department!'

30:41.709 --> 30:43.667
'You're completely surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!'

30:43.754 --> 30:45.104
Stay cool.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.378
Just stay cool.

31:07.604 --> 31:08.562
Go.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.435
- Clear!
- Clear!

31:12.522 --> 31:15.134
There's a trap door.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.918
- I got him.
- Lisbon?

31:17.005 --> 31:19.051
- Jane.
- Wow, I'm impressed.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.617
How the hell did you
find me out here?

31:20.704 --> 31:22.489
Right, because
we're lost without you?

31:22.576 --> 31:24.491
I wouldn't say that,
but I'm still impressed.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.014
- Wait. D-Don't move.
- Oh.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.060
They could have
booby-trapped the place.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.800
We'll have the bomb squad
take a look at you.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.325
What? Oh, you're kidding.
You're kidding.

31:32.412 --> 31:33.761
I'm-I'm thankful and all that

31:33.848 --> 31:35.154
'but just get me out of here'

31:35.241 --> 31:36.285
'and I'll tell you the story.'

31:36.372 --> 31:37.808
- What story?
- Ahh.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.514
- So we know who Jasper is.
- Fonteneau.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.081
No trace of him. Slipped right
through the locals' hands.

31:49.168 --> 31:50.560
He's one guy,
for crying out loud.

31:50.647 --> 31:52.432
He obviously knows
those woods a lot better.

31:52.519 --> 31:53.824
Jane, enough recovery time.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.304
Tell us about Fonteneau.
What'd he say?

31:55.391 --> 31:58.394
Well, he sprouted
a lot of nonsense, denial.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.396
Truth is, he took the job
in the mayor's office

32:00.483 --> 32:03.269
to plan targeted attacks
on new developments around town.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.793
He and St. Clare became lovers.

32:05.880 --> 32:06.837
Secret boyfriend.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.230
But when St. Clare found out

32:08.317 --> 32:10.537
about Fonteneau's
secret life as Jasper

32:10.624 --> 32:12.800
he killed her for it,
to keep her quiet.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.802
I'll check on the warrant
for Fonteneau's place.

32:14.889 --> 32:17.413
Get everybody briefed,
suited up and ready to roll.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.762
Oh, look for
St. Clare's necklace.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.677
It was a gift from Fonteneau.

32:20.764 --> 32:23.419
[Patrick]
'My guess, he took it
when he killed her. We need it.'

32:23.506 --> 32:26.248
You guys sit on the location
until the warrant comes in.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.384
Chief Donner?
Yeah, i-it's Lisbon.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.821
Oh, I need some Aspirin.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.692
[Lisbon]
'Yeah.'

32:35.779 --> 32:39.131
Yeah, I-I just wanted..
could you hold on, chief?

32:39.218 --> 32:41.568
Look, that's enough, guys.
We're done filming.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.613
You know, catching
the bad guy would be

32:43.700 --> 32:46.747
a great end of the show, make
you guys look like superstars.

32:46.834 --> 32:49.402
Well, it'd certainly make
the deputy AG very happy.

32:49.489 --> 32:50.446
True.

32:51.839 --> 32:53.275
Alright,
you can film the bust

32:53.362 --> 32:55.625
but you have to do
exactly what I say.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.062
Deal.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.280
Meet me at Fonteneau's
at 06:00 hours.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.543
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, chief.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.241
We're gonna need assistance
from your entry team again.

33:27.570 --> 33:28.528
[sighs]

33:53.161 --> 33:54.641
What now?

33:54.728 --> 33:56.469
We set a perimeter
and wait for the warrant.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.906
Yeah, there's a lot
of this kind of stuff.

33:58.993 --> 34:01.256
Not too many car chases.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.087
Maybe we could, uh, ask a few
questions while we're waiting?

34:07.784 --> 34:08.916
Uh..

34:11.179 --> 34:13.573
Sure. If you must.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.620
[clears throat]

34:17.707 --> 34:21.624
Um, how did you come
to work with the CBI?

34:21.711 --> 34:23.061
You know how.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.366
Yes, but I-I need you
to say it to the camera.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.064
Yeah, yeah,
I-I see. I got it.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.155
[sighs]

34:30.242 --> 34:32.244
Um..

34:32.331 --> 34:33.854
Well, I came
to work with the CBI

34:33.941 --> 34:37.336
after my wife and child
were murdered.

34:48.825 --> 34:50.827
Have you ever
experienced loss like that?

34:51.959 --> 34:54.004
A loss of love?

34:57.182 --> 35:00.185
There's nothing more important
than love, is there?

35:00.272 --> 35:01.664
Well, we're talking about you.

35:01.751 --> 35:02.839
Yeah.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.193
It can be very hard
when love goes away.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.891
It's like a...a betrayal.

35:12.893 --> 35:15.069
Almost like a
violent act, right?

35:16.462 --> 35:19.856
- Right?
- I guess.

35:19.943 --> 35:22.859
Um, why don't-why don't
we go back to, um--

35:22.946 --> 35:25.688
When you give someone your heart
and they throw it aside

35:25.775 --> 35:28.517
it's natural to be angry.

35:28.604 --> 35:31.868
Especially when you've come
to rely on 'em.

35:31.955 --> 35:35.829
When your career
is tied to theirs.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.526
I don't know
what you're..

35:37.613 --> 35:39.137
Why don't you show us
what you got in your pockets?

35:39.224 --> 35:41.704
- What?
- You heard me.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.532
- No.
- Why not?

35:45.404 --> 35:46.796
Because you don't
have the right.

35:46.883 --> 35:48.972
Okay.

35:49.059 --> 35:52.715
Okay. I'll tell you
what you have in your pocket

35:52.802 --> 35:54.413
and you tell me if I'm right.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.502
In your pocket, you have
a blue topaz necklace

35:56.589 --> 35:57.894
that you once gave
to Martha St. Clare

35:57.981 --> 35:59.418
when you were lovers.

35:59.505 --> 36:02.334
You took that necklace back
after you killed her.

36:02.421 --> 36:06.076
You were gonna plant it
in Fonteneau's house.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.949
Prompted by
my cunningly brilliant ruse.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.347
Aha.

36:16.609 --> 36:19.786
Aha. That's it.

36:19.873 --> 36:21.440
I don't know
how that got in there.

36:21.527 --> 36:24.356
Oh, please. Don't be so silly.
Arrest him, Cho.

36:24.443 --> 36:27.359
Get on your knees.
Put your hands on your head.

36:27.446 --> 36:28.882
Now!

36:32.102 --> 36:33.887
Get up.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.323
That's for you.

36:36.455 --> 36:37.847
And this..

36:40.023 --> 36:41.460
...is for me.

36:46.726 --> 36:48.467
Here it comes.

36:49.772 --> 36:52.514
Bang. There.
You looked away.

36:52.601 --> 36:54.603
Martha St. Clare's body
hasn't been revealed

36:54.690 --> 36:57.389
and you looked away, because you
knew what was gonna happen

36:57.476 --> 37:00.000
because you buried that body
at that building site

37:00.087 --> 37:03.743
and you firebombed the trailer
to try and frame Jasper.

37:03.830 --> 37:07.268
You're too clever, Mike,
you're just too clever.

37:07.355 --> 37:10.053
Nah. You spout
a lot of theory

37:10.140 --> 37:12.273
but no legal proof.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.624
You want legal proof?
The lab reports came back.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.801
They found traces of Martha's
blood in the trunk of your car.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.850
[Lisbon]
'Do you want to tell us
what happened?'

37:33.163 --> 37:35.514
Rumors said
the mayor was dirty

37:35.601 --> 37:37.994
but there was no proof.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.518
I knew something was up.

37:39.605 --> 37:43.957
But...no matter
how much I pushed her

37:44.044 --> 37:47.308
Martha wouldn't
say anything. Nothing.

37:49.223 --> 37:52.313
And last night..

37:52.400 --> 37:55.055
I was going through
her computers.

37:55.142 --> 37:58.624
Checking on some stuff,
you know?

37:58.711 --> 38:02.584
I found this speech
she was preparing to give

38:02.671 --> 38:05.370
exposing the mayor,
as corrupt.

38:05.457 --> 38:06.762
With proof.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.678
Facts and figures,
the whole deal.

38:09.765 --> 38:11.898
And she kept it from me
the whole time.

38:11.985 --> 38:16.119
This is a story
that could've made my career.

38:16.206 --> 38:17.991
'I have been waiting
for a story like this'

38:18.078 --> 38:20.210
'my whole life.'

38:20.298 --> 38:23.692
And she's mad 'cause
I'm on her computer.Hello.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.520
So she..

38:27.783 --> 38:30.743
She said, uh, she couldn't trust
me anymore and that it was over.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.789
The argument escalated

38:33.876 --> 38:37.315
and, uh, I took
my necklace back.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.621
And then she starts
taunting me.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.712
Implying that
I don't have what it takes

38:43.799 --> 38:47.020
to be in the big leagues
anyway.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.022
Saying I'm a loser.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.329
She's had enough?

38:51.416 --> 38:54.375
She's had enough? She has?

38:54.462 --> 38:56.029
No, no, no, no.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.031
I've had enough. Me!

39:06.735 --> 39:08.346
Well..

39:08.433 --> 39:10.522
We'll take that
as a confession.

39:10.609 --> 39:13.655
In a stunning revelation,
Mayor Melba Walker Shannon

39:13.742 --> 39:16.832
'has been arrested by the DA
for corruption charges'

39:16.919 --> 39:19.531
stemming from the Granton
at Salter development.

39:19.618 --> 39:22.447
The accuser is her
closest aide, Wilson Fonteneau

39:22.534 --> 39:24.100
'who agreed to testify
against the mayor'

39:24.187 --> 39:26.276
in exchange for leniency

39:26.364 --> 39:29.454
regarding his activities
as eco-terrorist Jasper.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.499
'This only
the latest development'

39:31.586 --> 39:33.849
in a bizarre story
of murder and greed

39:33.936 --> 39:36.591
that has captivated
the Central Valley.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.158
Hey. I was enjoying that.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.508
Ugh. I hate how they
over-dramatize everything.

39:40.595 --> 39:41.727
Yeah, I hate that.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.337
Captivated the Central Valley.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.949
- Give me a break.
- Doughnuts.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.690
Ladies first.

39:48.777 --> 39:51.040
So, uh, guys?

39:51.127 --> 39:54.174
Uh, I have something to say.

39:54.261 --> 39:57.003
Wehave something to say.

39:57.090 --> 40:01.007
Uh, life's too short
for dishonesty.

40:01.094 --> 40:04.706
Van Pelt..
Grace and I are lovers.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.843
No, you're not.

40:10.930 --> 40:14.760
- Um, yes, we are.
- No, you are not lovers.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.152
Uh, but we are, though.

40:16.239 --> 40:18.067
No, you're not.

40:18.154 --> 40:19.504
Because a sexual relationship

40:19.591 --> 40:21.984
between two fellow
bureau employees

40:22.071 --> 40:24.030
is strictly against the rules.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.162
Which is why
we kept it a secret.

40:26.249 --> 40:30.253
But we don't want
to live a lie anymore.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.603
Come what may.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.300
[chuckles]

40:35.520 --> 40:37.522
Well, it's a big secret.
Well kept.

40:37.609 --> 40:39.045
Maybe you knew,
but nobody else did.

40:39.132 --> 40:40.307
I knew.
Half the building knows.

40:40.394 --> 40:41.395
- They do not.
- 'Yes they do.'

40:41.482 --> 40:42.483
The only person that didn't know

40:42.570 --> 40:44.050
is glaring at you right now.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.487
And now I have
to do something about it.

40:46.574 --> 40:50.186
- What are you gonna do?
- Yeah, whatareyou gonna do?

40:55.322 --> 40:56.671
I'm thinking.

40:58.630 --> 40:59.544
'Go.'

41:13.688 --> 41:16.299
[male narrator]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

41:19.085 --> 41:19.999
[theme music]
