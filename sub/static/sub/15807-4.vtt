04:50.557 --> 04:54.058

need is a big roaring fire.

There's a very good chance

right over this island.

We're not saved
yet, gilligan.

on your shoulders.

That's good, gilligan.
That's very good.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.891
I've got an even better idea,
skipper. An even better idea.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.594
- We'll build a human tower.

No, I think ginger
ought to be at the top.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.507
Why?

05:43.576 --> 05:45.510
Because she's wearing
high heels.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.812
I think a signal fire's
our best bet, gilligan.

05:47.881 --> 05:51.015

through that nimbus cumuli.

05:51.084 --> 05:54.452
Yeah, and all those clouds
are in the way too.

the transmitter knocked out.

got knocked out?

06:12.105 --> 06:13.939
Don't you remember?
I told you last night.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.107
I thought he was walking
in his sleep.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.210
Turned out he was
walking in my sleep.

06:28.922 --> 06:29.854

06:29.923 --> 06:32.524
You turned it
into a transmitter.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.059
I remember. It happened
at guadalcanal.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.362
No, it happened
over there by the lagoon.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.564
We were about
a mile off shore.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.600
The transmitter got hit. We were
strafed by enemy fighters.

06:42.669 --> 06:43.935
I had to do
something fast.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.004
Skipper, let me tell it.
It was my dream.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.840
Is it possible to convert
a radio into a transmitter?

06:48.908 --> 06:51.976
Sure! All you need a screwdriver
and a pair of wire cutters.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.378
Got 'em right here, sir.

06:54.447 --> 06:55.913
It's a simple procedure.

06:55.982 --> 06:59.584
It's just a matter of
reversing the circuits by..

06:59.653 --> 07:02.053
- Gilligan, how did I do it?
- I don't know.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.888
But you must have
seen something.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.524

the dive-bombers.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.893

i was swimming for my life.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.694
Think, skipper.
Come on, think.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.897
How did you convert
that radio?

07:13.266 --> 07:14.732
I don't remember.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.601
I know. I'll go back to sleep
and get on the boat

07:17.670 --> 07:18.870
a little earlier
this time.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.938
That was my dream
last night, not yours.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.041
- But you told--
- 'i know what I told you.'

07:23.110 --> 07:26.211
but I was wrong. Looks like
i owe you an apology.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.479
Forget it, skipper. If you
hadn't pushed me overboard

07:28.548 --> 07:30.182
I would have been
blown to bits.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.287
It has something to do with
the main coil. A main coil.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.988
- Main coil.
- Main coil.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.425
It's no use.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.893

with somebody watching.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.929
Alright, skipper.
You try it on your own.

07:44.998 --> 07:48.232
Yeah. Concentrate on getting to
sleep. Leave the worrying to us.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.068
The only thing you gotta worry
about is getting to sleep.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.170

gilligan. I'm not asleep yet.

Better hurry. That woman's gonna
be flying over at any time.

- I'm doing the very best I can.
- I know you are, skipper.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.894
So stop thinkin' about
the trouble we're in.

08:16.963 --> 08:19.698
You'll never get asleep
with that on your mind.

- He will if he's left alone.

to stand guard.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.610
Make sure nobody gets in there
and disturbs the skipper.

- That includes you.

Of course, I do,
gilligan.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.649
Every big business man
uses tranquilizers.

11:24.717 --> 11:28.653
Makes him calm enough
to take the rest of his pills.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.188
Could I borrow some?
It's very important.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.624
Oh, yes. They're in my pill
case, they're in my shelter.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.927
You stay there, darling.
You relax. I'll go get them.

11:35.995 --> 11:37.895
There goes
a lovely lady.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.964
Gilligan, my boy,
let me tell you something.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.767
Look behind every successful man
and you will find a woman.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.102
Yes, sir.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.938
Just make sure
his wife doesn't find her.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.908
It's a marriage joke, I mean.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.744
- Oh, there we are, lovey.
- Here you are, darling.

11:53.813 --> 11:56.314
Must have been heavy. Ah..

11:58.651 --> 12:00.718
(Mr. howell)
Ah, there we are.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.353
'How did these get in here?'

12:02.422 --> 12:04.455
now, let's see, what
did I want this for?

12:04.524 --> 12:07.424
(Mr. howell)
'Oh, yes, yes. My arthritis.
Of course, arthritis.'

12:07.493 --> 12:10.895
'lovey, my pet. Do you remember
which one of my shoulders hurt''

12:10.964 --> 12:13.397
ah, no dear, you asked me
to get these for gilligan.

12:13.466 --> 12:17.035
Gilligan? Well, he seems
much too young for arthritis.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.904
No, dear. Gilligan
came in for tranquilizers.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.740
Tranquilizers. Of course,
tranq...Here they are.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.143
They would have bitten me.
Here they are, tranquilizers.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.111
- I only need a couple.
- That's perfectly alright.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.813
Take the whole.
Plenty more, plenty more.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.249
Thank you, sir.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.252
Lovey, that is the younger
generation for you.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.655
Medication for
everything and anything.

12:37.723 --> 12:38.889
Yep.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.792
What is this?

12:40.860 --> 12:44.095
"Kills pain fast,
fast, fast."

12:44.164 --> 12:45.563
Indeed.

Nobody rushes a howell.

[Theme music]

12:58.411 --> 13:00.511
Hi, Mary Ann. Have you
seen the professor?

13:00.579 --> 13:02.747
No, but everyone will be
showing up for dinner soon.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.282
- Is it dinner time already?
- Well, just about. Why?

13:05.351 --> 13:07.118
I borrowed these tranquilizers
from Mr. howell.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.487
I wanna put a couple in
the skipper's mango juice.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.789
That'll calm him down
and get him to sleep.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.324
What a great idea.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.540
Mary Ann, will you give
this back to Mr. howell?

13:29.609 --> 13:31.943
- I gotta go get the skipper.
- Sure.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.428

13:54.167 --> 13:56.033
[Sniffs]
Hmm, what smells
so good?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.535
Burned swordfish.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.305
Burn the other side.
I think it might be better.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.407
[Yodeling]

14:06.846 --> 14:08.846
What are these for?

14:08.915 --> 14:10.715
Oh, tranquilizers.

14:10.784 --> 14:13.051
Ah, might be just
what he needs!

14:18.424 --> 14:20.524
- Come here a minute, would ya?
- Hm.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.361
Taste this thin gravy, would
you, and see what you think.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.300
O-oh! I think you need to burn
the fish a little more.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.934
(Professor)
'Hi, girls.'

14:31.003 --> 14:32.670
say, you seen gilligan?

14:32.739 --> 14:35.172
Well, he was just looking
for you. Anything wrong?

14:35.241 --> 14:37.274
No. I wanted
to see if he got the..

14:37.343 --> 14:39.210
- Got the what?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.479

'Please, skipper.'

gilligan, I don't have to eat
to keep up sta...I'm not hungry.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.500
- Please, skipper.
- Leave me alone.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.734
Sit down and take it easy.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.936
- Sit right here.
- Alright, I'll sit down.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.438
Here, skipper.
Have some mango juice.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.140
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you. Thank you.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.275
I don't want
any mango juice.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.311
How 'bout some fish.
Fish'll make you thirsty.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.145
Mary Ann, how's the fish
coming along?

15:15.214 --> 15:17.448
- Just about ready.
- Ready in just about a minute.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.017
- Here, have some mango juice.
- I don't want any juice.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.020
Please, now just leave
me alone. I wanna think.

15:26.492 --> 15:27.625
[Sighs]

15:37.704 --> 15:40.871
Hey, tranquilizers. Couple of
these ought to put me to sleep.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.205
- No!
- No, skipper.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.242
I don't think you should..

It's amazing.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.094
I had no idea that four
tranquilizers could produce

17:11.163 --> 17:12.463
this much of an affect.

the island pretty soon.

Can we fix the transmitter
in time? That's the question.

17:56.843 --> 17:57.842
Oh, yeah.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.812
