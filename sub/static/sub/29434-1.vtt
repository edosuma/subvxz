19:11.131 --> 19:12.998
The manure traces back to Pembry Farms.

19:13.066 --> 19:14.600
It's an organic chicken farm

19:14.659 --> 19:16.779
that operated outside the

19:16.803 --> 19:18.043

22:46.923 --> 22:48.857
I can see you're upset.

22:48.925 --> 22:51.760
Because your suspended agent has
continued to work on the case.

22:53.263 --> 22:54.963

22:55.031 --> 22:57.312
When she should have been home
waiting for her punishment.

22:57.336 --> 22:58.901

that Corporal Gaines here

24:20.350 --> 24:21.950

24:21.974 --> 24:22.974

24:54.876 --> 24:56.877

Officially, she was on a routine patrol

25:25.262 --> 25:27.641
that got ambushed by
extremists, but Gaines is

25:27.709 --> 25:29.789

holding back the truth.

25:29.841 --> 25:31.401
According to him, the unit was ambushed

25:31.425 --> 25:33.747
because the commanding
officers mishandled vital intel.

25:42.524 --> 25:44.658
But no one did. The
mission was classified.

25:46.292 --> 25:48.372
emptied his bank account of
70 grand and disappeared.

25:48.396 --> 25:49.776
Could explain why he had Andrea's

doesn't get much bigger than that.

27:06.201 --> 27:07.801
He doesn't want to make a big statement.

27:07.825 --> 27:09.376
He never intended to blow that bomb.

27:09.444 --> 27:11.404
Well, I got half a concussion
that says otherwise.

27:11.446 --> 27:14.348
Yeah, he used the explosives to
escape when we were onto him,

27:14.416 --> 27:16.450
but his goal was the VX gas.

27:16.518 --> 27:17.718
He's gonna release it somehow.

27:17.742 --> 27:19.620
It'll be deadly but quiet.

And that's not a
statement. That's revenge.

27:21.790 --> 27:23.257
