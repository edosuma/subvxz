01:00.140 --> 01:05.340
The desert unchanged
for millions of years.

01:06.420 --> 01:10.620
Yet witness to
a biblical prophecy come true...

01:10.820 --> 01:16.300
...that one day the meek
shall inherit the earth.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.140
This is not a drill.

01:43.820 --> 01:46.700
You need to evacuate the facility
in orderly fashion.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.260
Please locate to your nearest exit.

01:51.420 --> 01:52.740
Let's go! Let's go!

01:55.020 --> 01:56.900
There are ten emergency exits.

06:01.780 --> 06:03.180
The Eradicator!

06:27.540 --> 06:28.540
Ready?

06:29.020 --> 06:30.420
I'm steady.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.860
Watch it burn!

06:52.660 --> 06:54.100
My hero!

06:56.860 --> 06:58.260
Give me some sugar, baby.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.380
What's up, Brian!

07:08.580 --> 07:09.580
You're late.

07:09.900 --> 07:13.140
Well, you can't be late
to your own party, brother.

07:13.340 --> 07:14.340
Not possible.

07:14.540 --> 07:16.620
I just want to be sure
we're there when he arrives.

07:16.940 --> 07:18.980
I can't believe
I finally get to meet him.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.980
You mean we get to meet him...

07:21.180 --> 07:22.780
...because you wouldn't
even be there...

07:22.980 --> 07:25.060
...if I hadn't of
killed it in the race.

07:25.260 --> 07:26.460
You wouldn't have killed it...

07:26.700 --> 07:28.180
...if I hadn't rebuild your engine.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.180
Matter of fact that last jump
would have killed you.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.900
That's why I am taking
my star mechanic...

07:32.100 --> 07:33.540
...and bestie up on stage...

07:33.740 --> 07:37.100
...when I'm handed my medal
by the Eradicator himself.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.340
I could have not done it
without you, buddy.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.140
Speaking of which,
how's my baby doing?

07:42.340 --> 07:45.220
I installed the new suspension,
which you needed after that jump.

07:45.420 --> 07:46.420
Sweet, dude.

07:46.620 --> 07:48.540
Oh, and I changed out
the exhaust system...

07:48.740 --> 07:49.740
...which should give you
some extra horsepower.

07:49.940 --> 07:52.020
Enough technical mumbo jumbo.

07:52.220 --> 07:53.900
My victory party awaits.

07:54.540 --> 07:58.500
Beers, bikes, desert,
women Eradicator!

07:58.700 --> 08:01.460
Yeah! Today's going
to be unforgettable.

08:07.740 --> 08:09.180
Jump in, home boy!

08:31.020 --> 08:32.700
Dude, what are you doing?

08:32.900 --> 08:33.900
The desert's that way.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.980
I know,
but we have a stop to make first.

08:37.179 --> 08:38.980
This is Lisa's street.

08:39.179 --> 08:42.059
What? Oh, yeah, I know.
I invited her.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.140
You're messing with me, right?

08:44.980 --> 08:46.180
Would I mess with you?

08:47.020 --> 08:48.820
Maybe I would, but not this time.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.700
I can't believe you are doing this.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.780
I'm just trying to help you
out, man.

08:52.980 --> 08:54.700
You got to put on
your big boy pants one day...

08:54.900 --> 08:55.980
...and let her
know how you feel...

08:56.180 --> 08:59.260
...because if you don't, well,
somebody else is bound to.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.340
Hmm, fortune favors the brave.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.340
Nothing ventured nothing gained.

09:04.580 --> 09:06.460
It's like the Eradicator says.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.180
Believe in yourself...

09:08.700 --> 09:10.140
...Or nobody else will...

09:11.380 --> 09:12.700
But that's just a movie!

09:13.020 --> 09:15.100
Well, maybe it's time
to start living...

09:15.300 --> 09:17.060
...the movie of your life, my man.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.860
And if it were a movie...

09:19.380 --> 09:21.500
This part would be in slow motion.

09:27.780 --> 09:30.660
Holy Virgin Mary of Bethlehem.

09:30.860 --> 09:32.620
Yeah, she's really something.

09:34.620 --> 09:35.620
Hi, Lukas!

09:35.980 --> 09:37.140
Howdy, Lisa!

09:40.820 --> 09:41.820
Hey, Brian!

09:43.540 --> 09:44.540
Thanks!

09:45.100 --> 09:46.620
I really appreciate the ride.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.260
How can I deny a pretty lady
a wild party?

09:49.460 --> 09:51.260
That would be downright
irresponsible.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.380
I saw your name
on the dean's list, Lisa.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.540
Pretty cool, congrats!

09:55.740 --> 09:56.820
Thanks!

09:57.340 --> 09:58.460
Too bad I'm not on
the President's list...

09:58.660 --> 10:00.820
- ...like some people.
- That's really no big deal.

10:02.220 --> 10:04.180
I had to bust my ass just to get
on the dean's list...

10:04.380 --> 10:06.180
...and you're saying
that's no big deal...

10:06.380 --> 10:08.180
...that you got on
the President's list.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.100
What are you trying to do?
Rub it in?

10:10.340 --> 10:13.300
No... No.
I mean, it is a big deal...

10:13.500 --> 10:14.940
...I'm just messing with you,
Brian.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.780
What I meant to say was
congrats as well...

10:18.740 --> 10:21.020
Boring! Enough school talk.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.780
Let's party!

10:38.340 --> 10:41.220
So, you guys get to meet
the Eradicator, huh?

10:41.660 --> 10:42.780
Are you excited?

10:43.140 --> 10:44.820
Does the pope s..t in the woods?

10:46.620 --> 10:48.380
Hell yeah, we are, right, Bry?

10:48.580 --> 10:50.300
Yeah, it's going to be great.

10:50.540 --> 10:52.620
No kidding, it's going to be great!

10:54.740 --> 10:57.500
I know everyone loves
the original but...

10:57.700 --> 11:01.460
...I think part three is the
unsung masterpiece of the series.

11:01.860 --> 11:05.740
To me it really embodies what
these movies should be about.

11:06.180 --> 11:09.300
The stunt work and
the ridiculous plot...

11:09.500 --> 11:11.540
...combined with the
increased budget...

11:11.740 --> 11:14.620
...really jelled into
what I would consider to be...

11:14.820 --> 11:18.380
...the perfect Eradicator movie.

11:18.580 --> 11:19.860
So far anyway.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.820
You know I hear they're trying
to get part seven off the ground.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.940
You should ask him about it
when you meet him.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.820
Now what's this happy horse s..t?

11:37.380 --> 11:38.820
The Guarisco brothers.

11:42.140 --> 11:43.380
Oh, no! That ain't right!

11:43.700 --> 11:45.100
- Helmet! Take the wheel, Bry!
- No, no...

11:45.340 --> 11:46.540
Take the wheel!

11:46.820 --> 11:47.980
What is going on?

11:48.420 --> 11:50.500
- Drive!
- What are you doing?

11:50.700 --> 11:51.740
Pardon me!

11:55.500 --> 11:56.660
What is he doing?

12:05.860 --> 12:09.380
- He's insane.
- I know! Awesome, right?

13:43.820 --> 13:46.100
That's right, my loyal fans.
You're winner has arrived!

13:46.300 --> 13:48.260
Let the party begin!

13:50.260 --> 13:51.660
You're cocky a..e, Lukas!

13:52.020 --> 13:54.380
I dispute the a..e part
of that statement, Tim.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.500
Lukas beat both of you
last week and he just kicked...

13:56.700 --> 13:57.900
- ...your asses again.
- Yeah!

13:58.100 --> 13:59.660
He'd never do it with a bike that
you hadn't tricked out.

13:59.860 --> 14:01.460
Every modification I did was legit.

14:01.660 --> 14:02.700
You just chickened out
on that last jump.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.100
- You watch your mouth!
- Yeah! You watch your mouth...

14:04.300 --> 14:05.300
...nerd!

14:05.500 --> 14:06.980
No one talks
to the Guarisco's like that.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.180
- Nobody.
- Do us all a favor, Craig...

14:09.380 --> 14:11.020
Take your d..k out of
your brother's ass.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.660
- Hey, I'll put my d..k...
- Shut up!

14:14.060 --> 14:15.140
Later, losers!

14:16.500 --> 14:17.860
Yeah, you walk away from me, Lukas!

14:18.700 --> 14:19.820
That's where the party is.

14:31.940 --> 14:33.700
Whoa, Lukas!

14:34.340 --> 14:35.540
Yeah! Check it, man!

14:35.940 --> 14:38.100
Oh, hey! You got to try this, dude.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.980
- What is it?
- Uh... It's my Finnish family...

14:40.180 --> 14:42.860
...vodka recipe with and
added twist...

14:43.060 --> 14:44.060
...you're going to love it.

14:44.380 --> 14:45.420
Oh, dude, you want some?

14:45.620 --> 14:46.740
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

14:49.860 --> 14:50.860
My beer!

14:51.180 --> 14:52.180
Has a kick, right?

14:52.420 --> 14:54.500
Jesus! Tastes like gasoline, bro!

14:54.740 --> 14:56.460
Thanks, man! Come on!

14:57.900 --> 14:59.060
- Here.
- Nice.

15:08.060 --> 15:09.940
- Hey, Lisa!
- Hey!

15:14.540 --> 15:16.060
Just go talk to her already.

15:16.260 --> 15:17.460
- Huh?
- Huh?

15:17.660 --> 15:20.060
You barely said a word to her
the entire drive here.

15:20.380 --> 15:21.860
Well, it's hard to get a word in
when your...

15:22.060 --> 15:23.900
...driver is Mr. Personality...

15:24.100 --> 15:25.500
...and then hops out of the back
of the truck...

15:25.700 --> 15:27.740
...to soundly defeat
his arch-rivals in a display...

15:27.940 --> 15:30.540
...of physical dexterity
and mental equity.

15:31.380 --> 15:32.900
How am I supposed to follow that?

15:34.500 --> 15:37.380
Besides she doesn't need me
bringing the party down.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.900
You got to cut it out with
this whole lonely nerd thing.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.180
Chicks dig confidence.

15:41.380 --> 15:44.420
They want a guy who knows
what he wants and goes for it.

15:44.620 --> 15:46.380
Someone who grabs the world
by the balls...

15:46.580 --> 15:49.660
...and tells it to turn its head
and makes it cough.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.580
You going to be a man or a mouse?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.780
- A man!
- Good!

15:55.180 --> 15:57.060
Because the mouse
only gets the cheese...

15:57.820 --> 15:59.620
...but a man gets the girl.

16:01.820 --> 16:02.860
What's up, ladies?

16:03.220 --> 16:04.940
Hey, I think you're in my seat.

16:05.140 --> 16:07.140
Would you mind getting me a drink.
Is that okay?

16:07.860 --> 16:08.940
Thank you.

16:09.740 --> 16:11.700
Why... Why did you just
tell my friend to leave?

16:12.020 --> 16:13.780
Oh, just for a bit of privacy.

16:13.980 --> 16:15.580
- You're... You're Lisa, right?
- No...

16:15.820 --> 16:16.980
- Yeah, Lisa. Hi.
- Yes...

16:17.580 --> 16:20.620
So, you seriously came here
with those two losers?

16:20.820 --> 16:22.020
Why do you have a
problem with them?

16:22.220 --> 16:23.420
Oh, no, no... I don't.

16:23.620 --> 16:25.460
It's... It's my bro,
who really hates them.

16:25.700 --> 16:29.220
I am more of a lover
than a fighter.

16:29.940 --> 16:31.300
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

16:41.620 --> 16:42.820
Check this out...

16:48.380 --> 16:49.380
Didn't come out so good.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.300
- No. Oh, God!
- Hey!

16:51.500 --> 16:53.380
- Oh my God!
- That was awesome!

16:54.020 --> 16:55.500
- Don't... Stop making a mess!
- It's cool.

16:55.700 --> 16:58.140
They clean up afterwards and
it's about to get way messier...

16:58.540 --> 16:59.580
What does that even mean?

16:59.780 --> 17:01.740
I don't know,
but you're very attractive.

17:01.940 --> 17:04.180
- You repulse me.
- And you attract me.

17:05.819 --> 17:07.220
Is my little brother bothering you?

17:07.780 --> 17:08.859
Yes!

17:09.819 --> 17:12.540
So Craig, why don't you be
a good boy and run along...

17:13.180 --> 17:14.220
I'm your big brother.

17:14.420 --> 17:15.780
Only by like a year.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.020
Yeah, and because
you'll never beat me.

17:17.220 --> 17:18.619
You'll always be in a second place.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.220
Oh, yeah?

17:21.339 --> 17:23.460
All right, let's give it up
to my main man, Lukas!

17:23.740 --> 17:25.180
Lukas, where are you, man!

17:25.380 --> 17:27.420
Come on, get up here!
Where are you?

17:29.900 --> 17:32.340
Is everyone having a good time!

17:33.020 --> 17:34.020
Yeah!

17:34.540 --> 17:35.940
All right! Well, first...

17:36.580 --> 17:38.540
I want to thank each
and every one of you...

17:38.740 --> 17:41.020
...for coming out to middle
of fricking nowhere...

17:41.220 --> 17:43.620
...to help celebrate my big win!

17:45.500 --> 17:47.900
I'm pretty sure it was kind
of about the free booze too...

17:48.100 --> 17:50.340
- ...but never mind!
- I love you, Lukas!

17:50.540 --> 17:52.580
I love you too, hot random girl.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.180
But seriously...

17:55.700 --> 17:57.380
I'm only as good as the bike
that I ride...

17:57.580 --> 17:59.020
...and my bike wouldn't be s..t...

17:59.220 --> 18:00.700
...if it weren't for
my master mechanic...

18:00.940 --> 18:02.060
Come on, Brian!

18:02.420 --> 18:03.620
Get on up here!

18:08.180 --> 18:09.260
Brian?

18:22.860 --> 18:24.380
- What's that?
- Geez!

18:25.340 --> 18:27.100
Little jumpy aren't you, Nancy?

18:28.700 --> 18:29.820
Looks abandoned.

18:30.580 --> 18:31.780
I wonder where the owner is.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.500
Me too!

18:37.460 --> 18:38.820
Hey! Don't litter, man!

18:44.820 --> 18:45.820
What's that?

18:46.340 --> 18:47.380
What?

18:47.940 --> 18:50.020
Come on, dude! Littering!

18:50.220 --> 18:52.020
Urinating on pristine land.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.540
Philistine.

18:55.020 --> 18:58.060
I've never been to Philadelphia
or Palestine, dude.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.460
Hey, you got another beer?

19:04.340 --> 19:05.380
Nope.

19:05.820 --> 19:07.140
I haven't even had one yet.

19:08.660 --> 19:10.340
And whose fault is that, man?

19:11.540 --> 19:13.540
Look, the solution
to all your thirst...

19:13.740 --> 19:16.140
...and love problems
are right over there!

19:17.460 --> 19:18.660
You're coming back, right?

19:19.300 --> 19:21.340
- Of course.
- Okay.

19:21.980 --> 19:23.180
Because I'm just, you know...

19:23.620 --> 19:25.180
...checking you're
not thinking about...

19:25.620 --> 19:27.340
...because if you did
I would have to ask Lisa out...

19:27.540 --> 19:29.380
- ...you know that, right?
- Jerk!

19:34.140 --> 19:35.780
Do I really seem that morose?

19:37.500 --> 19:39.380
I don't know what that
means, but...

19:40.260 --> 19:42.380
...you definitely seem depressed.

19:44.660 --> 19:46.220
I'm not a catch for Lisa.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.860
She's so cool and
smart and beautiful...

19:50.060 --> 19:51.100
You're smart.

19:51.660 --> 19:54.380
You use words everyday
I've never even heard of, dude.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.340
You...

19:56.820 --> 19:58.780
...know how to fix machines
that I can only ride.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.060
That's what I'm saying.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.260
I'm nothing but a support system.

20:02.820 --> 20:05.820
A guy who stands on the sidelines
while everyone flies by.

20:06.020 --> 20:08.140
None of this self-doubt
or existential b..t...

20:08.340 --> 20:09.980
...is going to get you anywhere
with her.

20:10.820 --> 20:12.460
The hell do you know
what existential means...

20:12.660 --> 20:14.020
...but not philistine?

20:16.020 --> 20:17.140
Beats me.

20:29.860 --> 20:31.460
Right, philistine!

20:38.940 --> 20:40.340
Dude, what the hell is that?

20:41.300 --> 20:42.700
Let's go check that out, man!

20:42.900 --> 20:44.300
- Down there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

20:44.500 --> 20:46.620
Let's not!
We could get lost or hurt or...

20:47.020 --> 20:48.380
Don't be a p..y!

20:52.060 --> 20:53.980
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude!

20:55.100 --> 20:56.100
Wow!

20:56.300 --> 20:57.900
This is awesome!

21:01.740 --> 21:02.780
Dude...

21:03.260 --> 21:04.780
Chicane Industries.

21:04.980 --> 21:07.300
- Where have heard that name?
- Everywhere.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.140
They sponsored the
party, the race...

21:09.340 --> 21:11.020
They're on your shirt for God sake.

21:11.460 --> 21:12.500
How about that.

21:13.020 --> 21:14.060
Chicane makes everything...

21:14.260 --> 21:15.700
...from a touch screen glass
of your cell phone...

21:15.900 --> 21:17.860
...to the protected plastics
inside your helmet.

21:18.340 --> 21:20.220
Seems kind of weird to have
a helmet factory...

21:20.420 --> 21:21.860
...way the hell out here.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.100
I don't think that's
what happens at this site.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.340
They're one of the biggest
military contractors in the US.

21:27.820 --> 21:28.860
Rad!

21:29.180 --> 21:31.020
So this is like a
secret bomb factory!

21:32.940 --> 21:34.660
Looks like one of
them went off already.

21:35.340 --> 21:37.620
I don't know,
but I think we should head back!

21:37.820 --> 21:39.580
Don't be a p..y! Come on!

21:56.460 --> 21:57.900
This is so cool!

21:59.100 --> 22:01.740
- It's private property.
- Oh, come on, man!

22:01.940 --> 22:05.460
There might be security or
defense systems or booby-traps...

22:06.100 --> 22:07.980
...or there could be
government secrets in there...

22:08.180 --> 22:10.460
...that if we find out about
would makes us marked men...

22:10.660 --> 22:12.100
We could be hunted
for the rest of our lives...

22:12.300 --> 22:13.820
...by black helicopters and...

22:14.420 --> 22:15.580
Oh, s..t!

22:18.180 --> 22:19.220
What did I say, man!

22:19.420 --> 22:20.980
Come on! This is awesome!

22:26.860 --> 22:28.780
- What's that smell?
- Who cares!

22:28.980 --> 22:30.740
This just like
Eradicator part three...

22:30.940 --> 22:32.260
...when he fights the baron!

22:32.580 --> 22:33.740
That was part four...

22:34.540 --> 22:35.580
Yes!

22:35.860 --> 22:38.180
This is cooler than cool, dude!

22:38.660 --> 22:41.100
Cool? Dude, this is super creepy.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.780
Don't put it down on
everything, man.

22:42.980 --> 22:44.260
You've always wanted
to do something like this...

22:44.460 --> 22:45.700
...and now is your chance.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.380
- Dude!
- What?

22:52.580 --> 22:54.140
You said you didn't
have another one.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.620
I was just trying to get you to
go back to the party, man.

22:57.820 --> 22:59.700
Look, I'll find you one,
but right now...

23:00.300 --> 23:02.780
...let's explore,
have fun, come on!

23:04.860 --> 23:06.420
I wonder what they do in here.

23:13.780 --> 23:14.820
Oh, what's that?

23:16.700 --> 23:17.700
Blood?

23:17.900 --> 23:19.660
Nah, that's not blood, man.
That's...

23:20.500 --> 23:22.140
That's just something disgusting.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.780
I think we should get out of here.

23:24.980 --> 23:26.260
Head back to the party.

23:26.460 --> 23:28.740
While your new found enthusiasm
for partying is inspiring...

23:28.940 --> 23:30.900
...but I really want to know
what's down there!

23:31.100 --> 23:34.500
This company creates crazy s..t
for the military, right?

23:35.340 --> 23:36.420
Well...

23:36.980 --> 23:39.340
...maybe we'll find
something cool, top secret!

23:39.540 --> 23:41.900
Yeah, because that what
multi-billion corporations do...

23:42.100 --> 23:43.220
...when they abandon a facility.

23:43.420 --> 23:44.700
They just leave their crap
lying around...

23:44.900 --> 23:46.260
...for anyone to
come along and take.

23:46.460 --> 23:49.860
Well, we'll never know
debating it up here, will we?

23:50.900 --> 23:52.140
Let's go!

23:54.060 --> 23:55.060
Ninja style...

23:58.620 --> 23:59.660
Yes!

24:00.420 --> 24:01.620
My God, man.

24:10.180 --> 24:11.220
Lukas!

24:13.620 --> 24:14.740
Brian!

24:17.300 --> 24:18.420
Hello!

24:25.500 --> 24:26.580
That's weird.

24:30.340 --> 24:31.420
Lukas!

24:32.660 --> 24:33.780
Brian!

24:47.580 --> 24:49.180
God, you scared a hell out of me.

24:49.380 --> 24:50.500
That's cool, babe.

24:51.140 --> 24:52.620
If you're scared,
feel free to hold me.

24:52.980 --> 24:53.980
Ew.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.060
Are you stalking me or something?

24:56.260 --> 24:58.060
Stalk? God, no!

24:58.500 --> 24:59.940
I was just making sure you're okay.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.700
Pretty girl like you shouldn't be
alone out here in the desert.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.020
I'm better off alone than
out here with a creep like you.

25:06.260 --> 25:07.420
Oh, come on!

25:07.780 --> 25:09.540
There's no need to
play the tough chick.

25:09.820 --> 25:11.460
No one out here to impress, just...

25:12.380 --> 25:13.900
...give in to your desires.

25:15.380 --> 25:16.460
Okay...

25:22.700 --> 25:23.860
Oh, you b..h!

25:24.260 --> 25:25.420
Why did you do that?

25:26.420 --> 25:29.020
I just gave into my desires
to knee you in the balls.

25:29.660 --> 25:30.700
Douche.

25:42.060 --> 25:43.140
Yes!

25:43.580 --> 25:45.740
Someone had a party!

25:47.340 --> 25:48.860
Dude, let's bring everyone
down here now!

25:49.420 --> 25:50.460
Bry?

25:50.660 --> 25:52.380
Sure, move the party...

25:52.580 --> 25:53.660
Swell idea.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.460
Let's go back and tell everyone,
right now.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.100
In a minute, Nancy.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.780
Would you stop calling me Nancy?

26:02.020 --> 26:03.100
Kitchen.

26:04.900 --> 26:05.980
Beer!

26:15.220 --> 26:16.660
Oh, yes.

26:16.940 --> 26:20.420
Dude, there is definitely
a beer in here!

26:25.060 --> 26:26.860
No beer, dude. Tough luck.

26:27.780 --> 26:28.820
It's still cold.

26:29.180 --> 26:30.220
You don't find it odd that...

26:30.420 --> 26:33.500
...an abandoned facility has
a still operational refriger..

26:33.700 --> 26:36.460
What you see as odd,
I see as interesting.

26:36.980 --> 26:38.180
Let's go!

26:51.940 --> 26:53.020
Lukas!

26:58.020 --> 26:59.060
Lukas!

27:02.700 --> 27:04.180
You should have seen your
face, dude.

27:04.420 --> 27:05.660
You got to check this out!

27:23.300 --> 27:24.340
Whoa.

27:24.660 --> 27:25.780
Right?

27:38.060 --> 27:39.220
What the hell is that?

27:40.220 --> 27:41.500
I don't know, man.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.420
- Gross.
- Toxic.

27:58.620 --> 28:00.340
It said Batch 9 on the door, man.

28:01.700 --> 28:02.700
What do you think that means?

28:02.900 --> 28:05.780
Well, I'm no detective but I'm...

28:06.420 --> 28:09.300
...guessing it's the ninth batch
or whatever they were making.

28:09.860 --> 28:11.940
You keep asking me things like
I would know something you don't.

28:12.140 --> 28:13.700
You're supposed to
be the smart one!

28:16.060 --> 28:17.100
What's that?

28:18.820 --> 28:21.420
Oh, now you're asking me like
I know something you don't?

28:22.300 --> 28:23.420
Security camera?

28:23.940 --> 28:24.980
I'm not sure.

28:25.940 --> 28:27.020
Looks more like a...

28:27.500 --> 28:28.580
What was that?

28:29.260 --> 28:30.300
Let's go check it out.

28:30.980 --> 28:32.100
Are you kidding me?

28:33.540 --> 28:34.980
Come on, Nancy.

28:35.820 --> 28:37.780
You're the one hugging me, Gaylord!

28:39.340 --> 28:40.460
Whatever...

28:40.940 --> 28:42.020
Let's go!

28:43.940 --> 28:45.500
This is a terrible idea.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.820
Come on!

28:54.420 --> 28:55.660
Hello! Is anyone there?

28:55.860 --> 28:56.900
Are you for real?

28:57.100 --> 28:58.580
What if it's a serial killer?

28:59.060 --> 29:00.060
Then we're like all those chicks...

29:00.260 --> 29:01.500
...who gets sliced
up in those movies...

29:01.700 --> 29:02.980
...following our curiosity.

29:03.180 --> 29:05.620
Why do we have to be chicks
in this little story of yours?

29:06.220 --> 29:07.300
What?

29:08.700 --> 29:10.660
Just a little further.

29:12.660 --> 29:15.140
Please. Let's just get out of here.

29:16.500 --> 29:19.180
Yeah. Okay, okay.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.220
Telling a girl how
you feel about her...

29:45.420 --> 29:47.100
...maybe is scary
as jumping a bike...

29:47.300 --> 29:49.060
...but at least it's not dangerous.

30:18.900 --> 30:19.900
Dude.

30:20.100 --> 30:21.420
What the f...

30:26.020 --> 30:27.100
We're going to die, man!

30:27.660 --> 30:29.060
- We're going to die...
- Shh! Calm down.

30:29.260 --> 30:31.180
Calm down? That thing scares
the s..t out of me!

30:31.780 --> 30:34.100
No kidding! A giant monstrous ant
scares the s..t out of you?

30:34.300 --> 30:36.860
This is no time for jokes, Brian!
I hate ants!

30:37.060 --> 30:38.060
I hate them!

30:38.260 --> 30:39.380
Do you think I would
be this scared...

30:39.580 --> 30:40.900
...of a giant panda
bear, because...

30:42.540 --> 30:43.740
Answer it!

30:45.940 --> 30:48.060
Lisa?
Why is she calling you?

30:48.660 --> 30:49.900
- Lisa!
- Lukas!

30:50.420 --> 30:53.220
Where are you?
I've been looking all over for you.

30:53.420 --> 30:54.820
Okay... Listen, we need your help.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.100
What?

30:56.300 --> 30:57.940
Wait, why are you whispering?

30:58.300 --> 30:59.940
We found this freaky building.

31:00.700 --> 31:03.140
That still doesn't explain
why you're whispering?

31:03.340 --> 31:05.180
We're trapped by this giant ant!

31:06.500 --> 31:07.860
Are you guys messing
with me because...

31:08.060 --> 31:10.340
...I've had enough pervs trying
to mack on me in the last...

31:10.540 --> 31:12.220
Listen! We need help!

31:12.420 --> 31:14.100
We're trapped by a giant ant.

31:14.380 --> 31:15.580
Trapped by a what?

31:16.500 --> 31:17.660
A giant fricking ant!

31:17.860 --> 31:19.020
Not so loud.

31:19.540 --> 31:21.940
I'm by this chasm and...

31:22.380 --> 31:23.660
You're at the chasm...

31:23.860 --> 31:25.340
Look down and you'll see a tunnel.

31:25.540 --> 31:26.580
Go through the tunnel
and you'll come...

31:26.780 --> 31:28.780
...to this massive place.
Go through the front door.

31:29.540 --> 31:30.980
- Hello!
- Go through the front...

31:31.340 --> 31:32.420
Hello?

31:33.820 --> 31:34.820
Lisa?

31:35.820 --> 31:36.820
It's dead.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.460
- F..k!
- Shh!

31:38.780 --> 31:39.940
You call her.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.300
I can't, Lukas.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.700
I don't have her number.

31:42.940 --> 31:44.060
What do we do then?

31:45.540 --> 31:46.580
Find a weapon.

31:46.780 --> 31:47.820
Anything.

31:48.020 --> 31:49.020
Right!

32:02.100 --> 32:04.300
What in the hell are going to
do with that? Swat it to death?

32:04.500 --> 32:06.620
Well, what are going to do
with that? Make it breakfast?

32:08.900 --> 32:10.020
Let's go!

32:58.540 --> 32:59.740
Holy s..t, man...

32:59.940 --> 33:01.780
That was like straight up
Jurassic Park s..t.

33:02.020 --> 33:03.780
I mean exactly Jurassic Park.

33:03.980 --> 33:06.380
I can't handle it, man.
Why did it have to be ants?

33:06.900 --> 33:08.220
This is too stressful...

33:09.060 --> 33:10.820
- Just too stressful.
- No!

33:39.740 --> 33:40.740
Good boy...

33:40.980 --> 33:42.020
Good boy.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.100
Stay back!

33:46.620 --> 33:48.140
Go. Go!

33:51.340 --> 33:52.420
Darn it!

33:55.460 --> 33:56.460
Over here!

33:58.420 --> 33:59.460
Help!

34:11.380 --> 34:12.420
Bry!

34:12.620 --> 34:13.659
Don't!

34:19.820 --> 34:20.820
What are you doing?

34:21.020 --> 34:22.060
Help!

34:22.500 --> 34:23.780
Get off!

34:24.300 --> 34:25.380
I'm coming, man!

34:25.580 --> 34:26.699
I'm coming!

34:28.540 --> 34:29.659
Hold on!

34:32.300 --> 34:33.300
Hold on!

34:33.500 --> 34:34.580
Hold on!

34:34.900 --> 34:37.460
- Oh, s..t! Oh, s..t!
- What are you doing?

35:08.660 --> 35:09.780
Lisa!

35:10.580 --> 35:11.700
Awesome!

35:19.660 --> 35:21.500
- We did it!
- We did it?

35:21.700 --> 35:22.740
Well, I helped!

35:22.940 --> 35:25.220
I threw the empty beer can
so Lisa could distract it.

35:25.420 --> 35:27.900
- You're welcome, Lisa!
- Yeah, sure. Thanks, Lukas.

35:28.100 --> 35:30.660
Thank you, Lisa.
That was amazing!

35:31.100 --> 35:32.540
Sure. You're welcome, Brian.

35:32.740 --> 35:34.020
Are... Are you okay?

35:34.580 --> 35:35.620
Physically...

35:36.260 --> 35:37.340
I think I'm fine.

35:38.260 --> 35:39.260
Mentally...

35:39.860 --> 35:40.900
I honestly don't know.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.940
Can someone explain to me
what just happened?

35:43.140 --> 35:45.380
Yeah! You just kicked
a giant ant's ass!

35:45.580 --> 35:46.860
Oh... Okay, good.

35:47.180 --> 35:48.340
I was starting to think
Craig dropped acid...

35:48.540 --> 35:49.900
...in my drink or something.

35:50.420 --> 35:52.140
What a sobering experience.

35:52.620 --> 35:53.900
Hey guys, we should probably
get out of here...

35:54.100 --> 35:56.380
I never really thought about
that expression before, but...

35:56.740 --> 35:57.780
...I was kind of buzzed before.

35:57.980 --> 36:00.340
Now, that was truly
a sobering experience, guys...

36:00.540 --> 36:02.620
Lukas! We need to get out of here.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.500
- Now!
- Yeah, I'm with her!

36:04.980 --> 36:07.820
Think about it. Ants are usually
part of colony, right?

36:08.780 --> 36:11.700
I wounded ant emits
an alarm pheromone that sends...

36:11.900 --> 36:14.060
...nearby ants into
an attack frenzy...

36:14.260 --> 36:16.460
...and attracts more ants
from farther away.

36:17.260 --> 36:18.500
How the hell did you know that?

36:18.820 --> 36:19.860
What?

36:20.340 --> 36:21.900
You think because
Lisa is beautiful...

36:22.100 --> 36:23.260
...she can't be smart too?

36:23.500 --> 36:24.620
Well, I've got news for you.

36:24.940 --> 36:26.380
Lisa is more than
just a pretty face.

36:26.580 --> 36:29.820
She got brains, personality
and she's obviously super brave.

36:30.020 --> 36:31.060
Brian.

36:31.260 --> 36:33.500
Thanks for the kind
words and all but...

36:37.020 --> 36:38.020
Oh, okay...

36:38.300 --> 36:39.380
Sorry.

36:40.260 --> 36:41.820
But you're still smart and...

36:51.980 --> 36:53.860
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Where do I go?

36:54.980 --> 36:56.060
In here!

37:00.340 --> 37:01.540
Come on!

37:24.460 --> 37:25.700
Wowzers!

37:27.500 --> 37:28.540
You think they're gone?

37:28.820 --> 37:30.580
I don't know.
You want go out there and check?

37:31.060 --> 37:32.140
Not really.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.500
Are you okay and stuff?

37:37.620 --> 37:38.860
Yeah, I'm okay and stuff.

37:39.060 --> 37:40.140
Okay, cool.

37:41.940 --> 37:42.980
No service.

37:43.180 --> 37:44.180
Yeah, me either.

37:44.380 --> 37:46.020
There's got to be a way
to communicate with someone.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.900
Hello! Hello!

37:52.180 --> 37:53.180
Gee whiz!

37:53.380 --> 37:54.580
Look at the ants, Cindy!

37:54.780 --> 37:56.060
So industrious.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.660
And they are all working
for their queen.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.100
How chivalrous.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.340
This video looks like it was made
in the fifties.

38:04.860 --> 38:06.340
How old is this facility?

38:06.980 --> 38:08.460
It's true, Billy and Cindy...

38:08.660 --> 38:11.780
...that ants have
all sorts of admirable traits.

38:12.500 --> 38:15.700
But their organization and
abilities become quite scary...

38:18.260 --> 38:20.300
...once they're as big as a horse!

38:20.980 --> 38:24.740
"Duck and Cover" may work
in most cases, but not this time.

38:25.620 --> 38:27.380
Understanding the
natural instincts...

38:27.580 --> 38:29.460
...of these creatures
will help you survive...

38:29.660 --> 38:31.580
...if there's an infestation.

38:32.340 --> 38:33.780
Instead of Duck and Cover...

38:33.980 --> 38:36.740
...we recommend Run and Evade!

38:45.340 --> 38:47.700
Sweet! A first person shooter.
I love these games!

38:47.900 --> 38:49.100
Where's the controller?

38:51.100 --> 38:53.340
Crap. It's like those
old games you like to play.

38:53.620 --> 38:55.660
Hmm. I don't think it's a game.

38:57.700 --> 38:58.780
What?

39:00.260 --> 39:01.420
No!

39:06.140 --> 39:07.460
Yes! Nice, man!

39:08.500 --> 39:09.700
Awesome, dude!

39:10.820 --> 39:12.060
Sweet, dude!

39:16.860 --> 39:18.580
I don't know when
this video will be found.

39:18.780 --> 39:19.820
Hopefully not too long...

39:20.020 --> 39:22.460
...because they make thousands
of new eggs in a day...

39:22.660 --> 39:23.860
Who the hell is this guy?

39:24.260 --> 39:25.260
Put the game back on.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.740
I'm Dr. Renard of project "Them".

39:28.100 --> 39:30.260
After the original
outbreak of 1951.

39:30.460 --> 39:32.220
We were able to
contain the subjects...

39:32.420 --> 39:34.380
...for testing and experimentation.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.100
Using a piece of the original
alien DNA...

39:37.300 --> 39:39.460
...taken from the meteorite
we were able to splice...

39:39.660 --> 39:42.660
...their DNA from fire ants
and spiders...

39:42.860 --> 39:44.300
...to create commercial
applications...

39:44.500 --> 39:47.300
...that can mean great progress
for all of mankind...

39:47.780 --> 39:51.060
...but there was a security
breach this morning. Batch 9.

39:51.260 --> 39:53.060
The cleverest of the bunch
were able to anticipate...

39:53.260 --> 39:55.660
...the feeding schedule
and laid an ambush.

39:55.860 --> 39:58.340
Our private security forces
were useless.

39:58.660 --> 40:01.140
One dozen of our best men
are now missing...

40:01.580 --> 40:02.620
...and presumed dead.

40:02.980 --> 40:05.420
Now that the batch has fed
it will attempt to make a colony.

40:05.620 --> 40:09.780
Somewhere dark and cool,
so the queen can lay her eggs.

40:09.980 --> 40:13.700
Fortunately, I spliced their DNA
so the subjects require...

40:13.900 --> 40:15.580
...ethanol to fuel
precursor compounds...

40:15.780 --> 40:18.660
...and catalytic enzymes
to create monomers...

40:18.900 --> 40:20.860
...the building blocks
of the proteins necessary...

40:21.060 --> 40:22.420
...to fertilize their eggs.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.060
And I thought you used big words...

40:24.260 --> 40:25.460
What did he just say?

40:25.780 --> 40:27.780
He said they need ethanol
to have babies.

40:28.060 --> 40:29.500
Fortunately, we're in the desert...

40:29.700 --> 40:31.140
...where ethanol
is in short supply.

40:31.340 --> 40:33.100
- What are you looking for?
- Thank God for that.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.740
Sign that says they need ethanol
to have babies.

40:35.940 --> 40:36.980
Idiot!

40:37.180 --> 40:38.900
I better not waste any more time.

40:41.460 --> 40:42.660
Holy s..t!

40:43.060 --> 40:46.380
Alien DNA, meteorites,
experiments...

40:46.580 --> 40:47.860
...spiders, giant ants...

40:48.060 --> 40:50.380
This is so fricking awesome!

40:50.580 --> 40:52.740
I mean, it's creepy as f..k...

40:52.940 --> 40:55.100
...but I got to say,
it's pretty awesome!

40:55.300 --> 40:56.620
No, guys!

40:57.380 --> 40:58.420
Guys.

40:58.900 --> 40:59.940
- What?
- What?

41:00.380 --> 41:01.380
Ethanol?

41:02.180 --> 41:03.220
So?

41:03.420 --> 41:05.340
Do you guys not know
what ethanol is?

41:22.300 --> 41:23.420
We have to warn them.

41:24.060 --> 41:25.900
Oh, God.
If only I could call somebody.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.580
That means leaving this room.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.620
They could be waiting for us
out there, dude.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.980
If Lisa is right,
they've gone to look for liquor.

41:32.380 --> 41:33.420
What other option do we have?

41:33.620 --> 41:34.740
We have to go!

41:35.900 --> 41:38.580
Fine! But if I die,
I'm never forgiving you!

41:39.060 --> 41:40.060
Deal.

41:40.580 --> 41:41.660
No!

41:52.100 --> 41:53.140
Take it off!

41:53.340 --> 41:54.420
Take it off!

41:56.180 --> 41:57.220
Take it off!

43:07.460 --> 43:08.500
S..t!

44:29.260 --> 44:31.060
Oh! Squirrel, dudes!

44:31.380 --> 44:32.860
I come in peace.

44:33.300 --> 44:35.580
I have no nuts to give you.

44:37.420 --> 44:38.460
Dude...

44:38.660 --> 44:40.940
You're not a squirrel,
you're an ant!

44:56.020 --> 44:58.060
Go! Go! Go! Go!

45:09.060 --> 45:11.260
Tim! No!

45:14.100 --> 45:15.180
S..t!

45:20.100 --> 45:21.580
- Jesus!
- Holy s..t!

45:21.780 --> 45:23.180
Do you think anyone survived?

45:23.780 --> 45:24.900
Doesn't look like it.

45:25.940 --> 45:26.940
Let's get out of here.

45:27.340 --> 45:28.540
We got to warn someone.

45:28.740 --> 45:29.940
- Like who?
- I don't know.

45:30.140 --> 45:33.340
The army, the marines, the cavalry,
a team of exterminators, dude!

45:37.060 --> 45:38.180
Come on!

45:47.100 --> 45:48.100
Hurry up!

46:16.620 --> 46:17.700
Hold on tight!

46:18.300 --> 46:20.540
What?
You'll never make that!

46:32.860 --> 46:34.540
Why did you do that?
Are you crazy?

46:34.740 --> 46:37.220
I'm trying to stop
you from killing us!

46:37.500 --> 46:39.500
Look at that gap.
You'd never make it!

46:39.700 --> 46:41.220
Oh, and Lukas would?
Is that what you are saying?

46:41.420 --> 46:42.420
What? No.

46:42.620 --> 46:44.020
Lukas couldn't make
that jump either.

46:44.220 --> 46:46.100
Nobody could,
not even the Eradicator.

46:46.300 --> 46:47.740
Lukas would at least would try.

46:48.020 --> 46:49.060
Yeah, I know he would...

46:49.260 --> 46:50.580
That's why he's such an idiot.

46:50.780 --> 46:52.220
- Now, can we go, please!
- But...

46:52.620 --> 46:54.220
When he jumped out
of the truck earlier...

46:54.420 --> 46:55.660
...I saw the way you looked at him.

46:56.420 --> 46:57.420
Like he was an idiot.

46:57.620 --> 46:59.940
Brian, do we really have to
do this right now?

47:00.500 --> 47:01.820
Look, okay...

47:02.380 --> 47:04.460
I know we're in a
dire situation but...

47:04.780 --> 47:07.380
...that doesn't mean that you
have to do anything reckless.

47:08.100 --> 47:09.380
You're smarter than that...

47:10.140 --> 47:11.460
That's why I like you.

47:14.100 --> 47:15.100
You...

47:15.580 --> 47:16.860
- ...like me?
- Oh my God.

47:17.060 --> 47:18.940
Boys can be so dumb sometimes.

47:19.140 --> 47:21.460
Yes! Of course, I do!

47:22.060 --> 47:25.100
I mean, why would I agree
to come to God damn desert...

47:25.300 --> 47:28.220
...with a bunch of drunk
extreme sports fanatics?

47:28.420 --> 47:30.740
But...
I thought you liked Lukas.

47:31.020 --> 47:32.020
Okay, Brian.

47:32.220 --> 47:35.100
I know you love Lukas, but come on!

47:35.300 --> 47:36.620
He's a doofus.

47:37.100 --> 47:38.140
I mean...

47:38.580 --> 47:40.420
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

47:42.620 --> 47:43.620
I think...

47:45.300 --> 47:47.540
...you're the best
girl in the world.

47:54.740 --> 47:56.340
- No...
- Brian!

47:57.780 --> 47:59.300
No! No!

47:59.620 --> 48:00.660
Brian!

48:21.820 --> 48:22.860
Hey!

48:24.580 --> 48:25.620
What happened?

48:26.340 --> 48:28.260
It took her. It got her...
I couldn't...

48:28.460 --> 48:29.620
Okay, okay... It'll be all right.

48:29.820 --> 48:31.100
- Can you ride?
- No. It won't start.

48:31.300 --> 48:32.820
Okay, hop on! We got to go get the
cavalry, remember?

48:33.020 --> 48:35.580
- No time to lose...
- No, I'm not abandoning her!

48:35.780 --> 48:36.940
Brian,
we can't save Lisa ourselves!

48:37.140 --> 48:38.180
Don't be stupid.

48:38.380 --> 48:39.940
It's stupid to not
try and help her now.

48:40.140 --> 48:41.940
- She's alive! It didn't kill her.
- Forget it, man!

48:42.140 --> 48:43.820
- We're just two idiots who...
- No!

48:44.020 --> 48:45.580
You're supposed to
be the risk taker.

48:45.780 --> 48:49.060
Either go get precious cavalry
or man up and come with me!

48:49.380 --> 48:50.780
Now, what's in that direction?

48:51.420 --> 48:53.260
- Star caves.
- Star caves.

48:53.580 --> 48:54.820
Somewhere cool and dark.

48:55.020 --> 48:57.100
A perfect place for
a giant ant colony, right?

48:57.700 --> 48:58.700
- Let's go!
- Come...

48:58.900 --> 49:00.300
What are you going to do
when you get there?

49:00.500 --> 49:01.580
I don't know.
I'll think of something.

49:01.780 --> 49:03.180
Dude, we're not the Eradicator!

49:03.380 --> 49:05.540
No, we're not! We're smarter
than the Eradicator...

49:05.740 --> 49:07.100
...and that's why
we're going to save her.

49:08.380 --> 49:09.420
S..t, man!

49:09.820 --> 49:11.580
I guess there are
worse ways to die.

49:12.460 --> 49:13.540
Thank you!

49:14.500 --> 49:15.780
Yeah, yeah.
If heaven isn't filled...

49:15.980 --> 49:17.020
...with an endless supply
of beer and women...

49:17.220 --> 49:18.620
...I'm going to f..g kill you!

49:28.980 --> 49:30.020
Stop here!

49:41.860 --> 49:43.100
You sure you want to do this, Bry?

49:43.820 --> 49:46.420
Imagine if Scarlett Johansson
was in there.

49:47.060 --> 49:48.740
But she's
the Black fricking Widow, dude!

49:48.940 --> 49:50.060
She can take care of herself.

49:50.260 --> 49:51.580
Okay, what if...

49:51.860 --> 49:53.580
- ...you're the fricking Hulk...
- Okay...

49:53.780 --> 49:56.220
...and we go in there
and rescue her Avenger style.

49:56.900 --> 49:58.020
Yes!

50:03.140 --> 50:04.140
Whoa!

50:04.340 --> 50:05.620
This is insane.

50:16.860 --> 50:18.100
I'm the Hulk, right?

50:19.780 --> 50:21.940
You're the Incredible Hulk.

50:22.620 --> 50:23.740
Yeah.

50:37.780 --> 50:38.780
Whoa.

50:39.260 --> 50:40.300
Now what?

50:41.060 --> 50:44.140
I don't know.
It's like mines of Moria.

50:47.620 --> 50:49.220
- This way.
- Really?

50:49.660 --> 50:50.700
Yeah.

51:20.340 --> 51:21.500
Was that a bat?

51:22.420 --> 51:23.540
Probably a bird.

51:29.620 --> 51:33.940
Trippy. We just went from
Jurassic Park to Aliens, dude.

51:35.260 --> 51:38.980
If my life has to be like a movie
why couldn't it be Deep Throat?

51:39.900 --> 51:40.900
Lame joke.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.580
How can endless p..y be lame, bro?

51:50.180 --> 51:51.460
Looks like they are keeping
them alive...

51:51.660 --> 51:53.380
...to feed the babies
when they hatch.

51:55.900 --> 51:57.140
Why are they glowing?

51:59.300 --> 52:00.380
There!

52:06.460 --> 52:07.860
You're going to be okay, Lisa!

52:08.460 --> 52:09.500
Please.

52:09.780 --> 52:10.940
Wake up!

52:25.660 --> 52:27.460
They're coming. We must leave.

52:27.980 --> 52:29.340
You're that guy from the video.

52:29.660 --> 52:32.340
Right. Dr. Strangelove,
Brown or something.

52:32.580 --> 52:34.020
I'm Dr. John Renard, yes.

52:34.540 --> 52:37.060
Though I'm in a process
of rethinking my career choice.

52:37.260 --> 52:39.140
My mom's got an
opening in her dinner.

52:43.140 --> 52:44.460
Hurry, there's no time.

52:44.660 --> 52:46.100
No! I'm not leaving her.

52:47.460 --> 52:49.340
You'll never manage to open them
without special tools.

52:49.540 --> 52:51.020
- Now come on!
- Help me!

52:51.220 --> 52:52.660
Dude, we got to go! No choice.

52:52.860 --> 52:55.660
Otherwise we die and
nobody gets saved!

52:55.860 --> 52:56.900
Now!

53:01.500 --> 53:03.580
I'll come back for you.
I promise.

53:12.340 --> 53:14.300
We must be careful
of the sentry guns.

53:14.620 --> 53:16.420
I assume you saw the video
I left which means...

53:16.620 --> 53:18.020
...that the sentry guns
are now activated.

53:18.220 --> 53:20.180
Yeah, right, that video game
Brian was playing.

53:20.380 --> 53:23.780
Yeah, we used them to eradicate
the first eight batches.

53:23.980 --> 53:26.060
But they run out before
we could take care of Batch 9.

53:26.260 --> 53:28.620
That's good, but Batch 9 are the
ones we need to worry about.

53:29.300 --> 53:30.420
Their critical
thinking skills mean...

53:30.620 --> 53:32.540
...that they'll be building
their ranks soon.

53:33.340 --> 53:35.580
But there are automated
sentry guns all over the site.

53:36.140 --> 53:37.380
If we wander in their range,

53:37.740 --> 53:39.380
our lives will be in great danger.

53:40.420 --> 53:42.020
This is a map
of the sentry gun locations.

53:42.220 --> 53:44.060
You will need this to avoid
being torn to shreds...

53:44.260 --> 53:45.820
...by fifty caliber bullets.

53:46.100 --> 53:48.100
Great!
So in addition to giant ants...

53:48.300 --> 53:50.900
...we now have robot
machine guns to contend with.

53:51.300 --> 53:52.860
This day gets better and better!

53:53.100 --> 53:54.260
You mentioned some
special weapons...

53:54.460 --> 53:56.140
- ...in your YouTube clip?
- Yes.

53:58.500 --> 54:00.420
We have some experimental
personal weapons...

54:00.620 --> 54:03.260
...that are able to penetrate
the ant's carapaces.

54:04.100 --> 54:06.300
Don't know if you've noticed,
but they're nigh indestructible.

54:06.500 --> 54:07.580
Yeah, we noticed.

54:07.780 --> 54:10.060
More of your scientific
modifications?

54:10.740 --> 54:11.820
Not really.

54:12.420 --> 54:14.060
Ants are incredibly
resilient creatures.

54:14.260 --> 54:16.780
All we did was splice them
with alien DNA...

54:16.980 --> 54:18.060
...and grow them to super-size.

54:18.260 --> 54:19.260
Oh, that's all?

54:19.780 --> 54:21.740
Where are they?
The experimental weapons.

54:22.180 --> 54:23.300
At the Bradley site.

54:24.060 --> 54:25.540
I just need a minute
to catch my breath.

54:25.740 --> 54:27.020
We don't have time for that!

54:27.220 --> 54:28.740
Actually, we do have a little time.

54:29.180 --> 54:31.340
The ants brought those people
back to feed the hatchlings...

54:31.540 --> 54:33.740
...something they weren't
able to do until now.

54:34.180 --> 54:35.540
I don't know where
they got the ethanol.

54:35.740 --> 54:37.740
But now that the
eggs are fertilised...

54:38.140 --> 54:39.580
...they will hatch and feed.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.380
The colony will grow and soon...

54:42.580 --> 54:44.620
...they will search for
the nearest source of prey...

54:46.100 --> 54:47.220
...town.

54:47.420 --> 54:48.420
How long?

54:48.620 --> 54:50.140
At least thirty minutes.

54:51.020 --> 54:52.300
Don't you have some way
to shut them down?

54:52.540 --> 54:53.860
A fail safe or something?

54:55.420 --> 54:56.860
My boy, they're not robots?

54:57.060 --> 54:58.900
Then how are you going
to control them in a battle?

54:59.740 --> 55:00.780
Battle?

55:01.860 --> 55:03.980
Project "Them" wasn't about
creating weapons!

55:05.980 --> 55:08.460
Why else would you create
freaky giant...

55:09.660 --> 55:11.660
- ...ants?
- It was for defense.

55:12.860 --> 55:15.700
Did you know that a housefly
running into a spider's web...

55:15.900 --> 55:18.660
...is the equivalent
of an F-16 flying into...

55:18.860 --> 55:21.900
...one of relative size at Mach 1?

55:23.020 --> 55:25.660
Standard-issue Kevlar is feeble
compared to that.

55:26.620 --> 55:30.420
We mixed alien ant DNA
with tarantula's DNA...

55:30.620 --> 55:32.300
...with intention of saving lives!

55:32.540 --> 55:34.660
Wait a minute.
How long has this been going on?

55:34.860 --> 55:36.220
Since the nineteen fifties...

55:36.580 --> 55:39.340
...when the meteorite crashed
into the town of Lizard Breath.

55:39.740 --> 55:40.900
Holy s..t!

55:41.300 --> 55:43.540
There's an actual town called
Lizard Breath?

55:51.780 --> 55:53.620
You need to get to
the Bradley site.

55:53.820 --> 55:54.900
You're young.

55:55.500 --> 55:56.740
You can make it in time.

55:58.180 --> 55:59.540
If we can get the weapons...

56:00.300 --> 56:02.100
...maybe we can put an end
to this batch.

56:02.900 --> 56:04.100
But Batch 10...

56:04.380 --> 56:06.300
Well Batch 10 will be perfect.

56:06.500 --> 56:07.540
Ten?

56:07.740 --> 56:09.940
Haven't you learned anything
from what happened today?

56:10.700 --> 56:12.340
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

56:12.540 --> 56:14.940
Mistakes happen when
new technologies are invented...

56:15.420 --> 56:18.780
...but the human price paid
is justified by the lives saved.

56:18.980 --> 56:20.140
Tell that to all our friends
who are about...

56:20.340 --> 56:21.700
...to become baby ant food!

56:21.900 --> 56:24.340
Enough!
We got to save Lisa.

56:29.580 --> 56:30.900
Look at the size of that thing!

56:31.100 --> 56:32.260
Shut up and run!

56:44.300 --> 56:45.340
Not that way.

56:45.740 --> 56:47.340
We'll get ripped apart
by the sentry guns.

56:47.540 --> 56:48.620
This way!

57:40.300 --> 57:41.420
I don't see any ants.

57:41.620 --> 57:42.700
Me either.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.100
He said the prototypes
are in the back.

57:45.300 --> 57:46.660
- Let's go!
- Wait!

57:47.140 --> 57:48.260
Ninja style?

57:49.340 --> 57:50.340
Yeah.

57:59.620 --> 58:00.620
Through there.

58:00.940 --> 58:02.100
Wait! Stop!

58:02.300 --> 58:04.900
Look, I though he told
you where they were located.

58:05.820 --> 58:06.900
I don't understand.

58:07.100 --> 58:08.180
He didn't mark one here.

58:08.580 --> 58:09.620
I understand.

58:10.060 --> 58:11.740
He wanted us to get killed
trying to get those weapons.

58:11.940 --> 58:14.700
He loves those ants more than
he loves the human race, Bry!

58:16.460 --> 58:18.140
Wait a second.
Maybe there are no...

58:18.340 --> 58:19.740
...prototype weapons.

58:19.940 --> 58:21.140
Let's at least check.

58:22.220 --> 58:23.500
Only twenty minutes left.

58:23.940 --> 58:26.180
How we're supposed to get past
that thing then?

58:29.540 --> 58:30.740
What are you doing?

58:30.940 --> 58:31.980
Brian?

58:34.940 --> 58:35.980
It's jammed!

58:36.180 --> 58:37.740
- How do you...
- We need to hurry!

58:38.900 --> 58:39.940
S..t!

58:48.700 --> 58:49.780
Oh, crap.

58:51.340 --> 58:53.220
- Where are the weapons?
- How am I supposed to know?

58:53.420 --> 58:54.620
Start searching!

58:58.260 --> 58:59.900
- Empty!
- Keep looking!

59:04.940 --> 59:06.260
There's nothing in here, man!

59:06.500 --> 59:07.620
Don't you give up!

59:15.660 --> 59:17.180
This is a stupid idea!

59:27.580 --> 59:28.700
There all empty!

59:28.900 --> 59:30.620
Yeah. Look, there's one more.

59:38.380 --> 59:39.540
Dude, check it out! There's beer!

59:39.740 --> 59:40.780
Not now.

59:42.220 --> 59:43.340
Geez, fine.

59:46.300 --> 59:47.900
Look, maybe the
guns are back there.

59:48.460 --> 59:50.220
Must be. There's nothing in here.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.940
Look, you did everything
you could, but...

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.820
...we're never going to make it
back before those eggs hatch.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.900
If we quit now, it won't just be
all them turning to ant food...

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.260
...our whole town will too!

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.340
Not if we can get the warning
out to somebody in charge.

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:17.980
You'll know exactly
how that will go.

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.940
The Return of the Living
Dead, remember?

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.980
They'll just nuke us all
to stop the scourge.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.780
We got to try get past that ant.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.060
I don't know, Brian. I...

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.900
Remember what the Eradicator says?

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.660
"Believe in yourself
or nobody else will."

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.180
Okay.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:39.540
Let's do this.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:41.940
But if I'm going
to die right now...

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.580
...I prefer to do it with
some beer in my belly.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.100
- Okay, pal?
- Okay, but we got to chug.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.260
Um, hello?

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.300
It would be nice to finally
get that beer...

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.620
...I've been wanting all day.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.380
Oh, right.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:02.900
Yeah.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.300
Stupid...

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.140
Bry!

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.540
Brian?

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.060
Brian.

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.140
Lukas!

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.540
I found them.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.140
System activated.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.660
Some kind of smart gun.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.060
- That's lucky.
- You know how to use a gun, right?

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.300
I know a lot about
a lot of machines but...

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.620
...guns...

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.380
...not much beyond point and shoot.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:47.940
Automated mode on.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.860
Weaponized and ready to engage.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.540
She sounds hot, man!

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:52.860
I want one.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.140
System activated.

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.220
A dude!

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.660
Why is mine a dude?

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.140
Here. We can trade.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.100
Hey, baby.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.220
My name is Lukas and
I'll be your daddy.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.060
What's that?

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.100
Plasma bolt cutter.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.900
This will cut right
through the cocoons.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.300
Check it out!

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:24.940
The Eradicator would weep.

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.180
Totally.

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.900
Say hello to my little friend!

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.780
Ammunition expended.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.620
Friendly. Do not open fire.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.060
Don't aim at me, dude!

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.740
- What?
- Easy with the gun!

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.740
Whatever, man!
We're f..g bad ass!

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.620
It's heavier than I thought, dude.

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.980
It's kind of hurting my balls.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.300
We only have ten minutes left.
We'll never make it!

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.380
Where's that movie magic s..t
when you need it...

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.980
...you know, Eradicator stuff.

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.300
Wait!
What's under here?

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.060
Whoa!

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.700
There are two?

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.140
Destiny!

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.060
You ready?

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.820
We're steady.

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.700
- Watch it burn!
- Watch it burn!

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.380
What was the plan again?

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.060
Oh my God, you came back for me.

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.260
Of course, I did.

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.500
I told you I would.

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.580
I hate to interrupt this
little moment you're having but..

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.460
Yeah, let's do this!

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.060
I still say this a lousy
trade, dude...

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.820
...and even lousier plan.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:06.900
Good luck.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.140
Wait! What are you doing?
The exit's the other way.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.220
There won't be an exit
if we don't stop them.

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.460
Do you trust me?

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:20.340
Good.

01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.180
- Follow me.
- Okay.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.260
Hey, ugly!

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.900
That's right!

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.300
I'm talking to you!

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.860
I am the Eradicator!

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.580
Ammunition almost spent.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.260
Prepare and reload.

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.340
What the hell?
You didn't say you're empty.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.740
I do not understand
your verbal command.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.540
Fire bullets! Kill it!

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.980
I do not understand
your verbal command.

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.660
I command you to fire!

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:02.980
I do not understand
your verbal command.

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:05.100
- Shutting down.
- S..t!

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.540
Run!

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.900
Let's get to work.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.980
Wait!
Why are you stopping?

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.780
They're getting closer. Just go!

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.260
We can't let them live!

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.620
I got an idea and
it just might work.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.420
And if it doesn't?

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.220
Then I'm glad I got to tell you
how I feel about you.

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.580
Oh my God! What are you doing?

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:39.900
Hang on!

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:31.620
Whoa!

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.979
How did you know that would work?

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.420
I...

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.140
I didn't!

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:45.020
Fortunate favors the brave.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.420
- Nothing ventures nothing gained.
- Nothing ventures nothing gained.

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:54.620
We did it!

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.779
Oh, man.

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:23.819
I was having the best dream
about my grandmother.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.859
She was like a unicorn, dude.

01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:44.740
- That way!
- Thanks, man!

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.380
Thanks so much.

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:47.660
Thanks, man!

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.140
Wait.

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.540
- What?
- The tank. I need it.

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:00.820
Oh, yeah!

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.100
No, man. I don't understand.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.820
I need the tank.

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.660
I thought you said
it tasted like gasoline, dude?

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.340
It does. That's why I needed.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.620
Okay.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.700
Dude, promise me you'll be gentle?

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.260
I promise.

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.460
That way.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.780
Thanks, man.

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:38.780
Fly free, my people.

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.100
Yeah, sayonara.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:56.540
Are you serious?

01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.460
Good enough.

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:21.180
Tim?
I came back here for you?

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:24.140
- Please, Lukas...
- Get me the hell out of here.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.860
Why? You're kind of a d..k, dude!

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.540
I'm telling you, Lukas,
you got to help me.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.820
Do I?

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.860
You sure about that?

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.900
Oh my God...

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.460
You need to jump, Brian.

01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:59.140
No, I... I...

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.660
You can do this.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:15.460
I believe in you.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.100
Whoa...

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:23.500
I can do this!

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.340
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.580
That's right, b..h!

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.180
We beat you!

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:52.100
Because you're ugly and stupid
and we're smarter than you!

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.060
- That's right! You are ugly...
- Brian...

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.700
- ...and we are smarter.
- Brian!

01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.180
Let's go!

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.220
Yes!

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.260
What's wrong?

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.140
I don't know.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.900
Are we moving backwards?

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.020
We're moving backwards!

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.260
- Eat lead!
- I do not understand...

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.020
- ...your verbal command.
- The hell is wrong with you!

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.260
I do not understand...

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:53.740
- ...your verbal command.
- Fire!

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:55.740
Fire bullets!

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:56.940
- I do not understand...
- Give me that!

01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.940
- ...your verbal command.
- Just drive.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.780
Listen up, b..h!

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.540
There's only one queen around here.

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.940
Not you and not the
queen ant either.

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.500
Weaponized and ready to engage.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.860
Engage target and eliminate.

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:13.820
Prepare to fire.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.100
Eat this!

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.500
We did it!

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:42.180
Jump!

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:55.940
Lisa!

01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:57.420
Lisa!

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:01.940
Are you okay?

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.420
Yeah...

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.100
Give me some sugar, baby.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:20.980
I promise to tell everyone...

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:22.740
...you're the best racer
in the circuit...

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.020
...and I...

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.900
I'll never doubt your
dominance again...

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.340
- And?
- And...

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:29.940
And I...

01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.180
I forgot.

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.260
And from this day on
you will refer to me as...

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:36.380
...Lukas "The Eradicator" Deakins.

01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.540
Okay...
Okay, just get me out of here!

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.380
Good enough for me.

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.900
Come on. We go to get out of here.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.540
Who's going to light the fuse?

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.780
Go! Save yourself...

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.500
I'll save the rest of us.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.740
Go, get out of here!

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.220
Here goes nothing.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:03.300
This is for you, Bry.

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:06.420
Watch it burn.

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.180
Dudes!

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.340
Did you see those big ass
ants, man?

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.580
Where's Lukas?

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.340
Wait, I thought he was in
there, man...

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.140
I think I hear something.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:35.780
Where's Lukas?

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.300
He saved me.

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:38.820
He stayed down there
to kill the eggs.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.420
- What?
- No!

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:41.780
It's full of flammable liquid.

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.180
You go down there,

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.460
you're just going to die with him.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.100
You hear me?

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:47.980
He wouldn't want that.

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:50.500
Lukas!

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:52.220
Lukas!

01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:58.980
Tim!

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.460
You're alive! Thank God.

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.100
He's only alive because
Lukas saved him.

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.780
He stayed down there
to kill the eggs.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.020
Is that true?

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.180
I wish it wasn't but
he saved everybody.

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:08.940
Get out the way.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.340
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I know what I'm doing.

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.740
Yeah!

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.500
Bry!

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.540
- Yeah!
- Whoa!

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.700
- Bro, yeah!
- Yeah!

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.460
Whoa...

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.700
Deja vu.

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.060
Oh, man, can I have that?

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:02.940
- Uh, sure.
- Thanks, bro.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:08.620
Thanks.

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:13.780
Thanks for saving me, man.
I won't forget it.

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:16.660
And I won't forget you saving
my brother and the rest of us.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.820
You really are the
champion, Deakins.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.620
He's also the best racer
on the circuit...

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:22.980
...and I'll never challenge
your dominance again.

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:24.500
Because I'm who, Tim?

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.420
Because you're
Lukas "The Eradicator" Deakins.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.900
Yes, I am...

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.300
...but you know what after that
you can just call me Lukas.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.980
Okay, that was kind of weird.

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.660
This whole day has been weird so...

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:37.980
...whatever.

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.140
That was pretty brave of
you, Craig.

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:44.060
Yeah, I guess it kind of was.

01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.820
Must of taken a lot of balls.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.860
I'd say you've earned this.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:54.900
Thanks.

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:00.180
Do you hear that?

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.260
By the power of
Grayskull, what is that?

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:07.980
Typical...

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:10.260
The cops finally show
when it's too late.

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.700
It's not the cops, Brian.

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:15.060
Then who?

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.700
- The Eradicator!
- The Eradicator!

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.180
Whoa!

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.100
Howdy, boys.

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.500
Heard about a big kegger out here
in the desert.

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:36.420
I thought I'd stop by.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.820
I hope that's groovy.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.100
Yeah, that... That's cool!

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.140
- Totally cool! Yeah!
- Very cool, man!

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.460
- Very, very cool.
- Well...

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.580
Then I guess that's cool.

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:53.060
Looks like you boys sure know
how to throw one hell of a party.

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.460
So...

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.100
Anybody got a beer?

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:01.300
Here you go, sir.
You can take mine.

01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:03.940
That's mighty gracious of you.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:12.700
Cheers, gentlemen.

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.620
Ready?

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:22.860
- We're steady!
- We're steady!

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.500
- Watch it burn!
- Watch it burn!
