02:07.129 --> 02:09.799
I'm Agatha Weiss.
I asked for a limousine.

02:09.869 --> 02:11.008
A stretch?

02:11.209 --> 02:11.809
Um.

02:12.019 --> 02:13.979
Yeah, there weren't any available.

02:18.879 --> 02:20.669
Can you find this place?

02:26.269 --> 02:27.389
Yeah.

02:27.539 --> 02:28.499
Ah...

02:28.749 --> 02:30.909
Look, cash call.
I'm gonna have to collect up front.

02:31.019 --> 02:33.149
It's 45 an hour.
2 hour minimum.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.459
Here's 200, okay?

02:40.459 --> 02:42.659
Can we get a star home map?

02:43.649 --> 02:45.169
Kind of a waste.

02:45.169 --> 02:47.569
Unless you want to see
where Ryan Seacrest used to live?

02:48.739 --> 02:50.229
Where did you come in from?

02:50.329 --> 02:51.419
Jupiter.

02:52.989 --> 02:54.299
Florida.

02:57.279 --> 02:59.309
What's happening in LA?

02:59.829 --> 03:02.179
Visiting family.

03:03.929 --> 03:06.149
Do you drive a lot of celebrities?

03:06.209 --> 03:08.149
I had Al Gore once.

03:08.459 --> 03:11.119
That was probably the heaviest...
for me.

03:12.029 --> 03:14.449
I drove Tatum O'Neil when
she had a reality show.

03:15.119 --> 03:16.669
Umm...

03:16.909 --> 03:18.139
Chuck Lorre...

03:18.139 --> 03:20.139
...who created 21/2 Men.

03:21.479 --> 03:23.989
Get a lot of producers...
directors.

03:24.129 --> 03:25.779
Eh... Juliette Lewis.

03:25.779 --> 03:27.779
She's a scientologist.

03:28.489 --> 03:30.069
I was thinking about converting.

03:30.189 --> 03:31.969
Just as a carrier move.

03:32.149 --> 03:33.679
You're an actor?

03:34.949 --> 03:36.589
Actor, writer.

03:39.109 --> 03:40.509
I know Carrie Fisher.

03:40.669 --> 03:41.969
Oh, really?

03:42.449 --> 03:43.659
How's that?

03:43.819 --> 03:45.439
I met her on Twitter.

03:46.289 --> 03:48.759
Yeah, we became like really good friends.

03:48.759 --> 03:50.759
I'm helping her with
a new novel she's writing.

03:52.049 --> 03:54.799
But it might be something she
winds up doing as an HBO show.

03:59.149 --> 04:00.769
What's this place?

04:01.009 --> 04:03.109
I thought it might be on a star map.

04:03.579 --> 04:05.869
There used to be a
really big house here.

04:06.169 --> 04:08.239
Childhood home of Benjie Weiss.

04:11.029 --> 04:12.399
So, how do you know that?

04:13.289 --> 04:15.259
I used to babysit for him.

04:16.159 --> 04:18.319
I was the original bad babysitter.

04:20.909 --> 04:22.719
It's weird.

04:25.319 --> 04:28.639
My agent is trying to get me
an audition for babysitter 2.

04:29.679 --> 04:31.779
I mean it's a long shot, but uh...

04:31.899 --> 04:33.349
Jacob Lightner...

04:33.439 --> 04:35.649
...got it to me...
he's a personal manager.

04:35.839 --> 04:37.249
He's a real heavy-weight.

04:37.329 --> 04:39.169
We went to Beverly together.

04:40.609 --> 04:42.179
I hold my fingers crossed.

04:50.949 --> 04:51.939
Hi, there.

04:53.849 --> 04:55.779
I'd didn't think you'd come.

04:55.779 --> 04:57.059
Why is that?

04:57.809 --> 04:59.129
You're so busy.

05:00.319 --> 05:01.459
Not for you.

05:01.909 --> 05:03.199
Hm.

05:03.759 --> 05:05.119
I, um...

05:05.519 --> 05:08.779
I... I liked 'Bad Babysitter'.
You were so funny.

05:09.829 --> 05:11.169
Yeah... uh...

05:11.319 --> 05:14.139
We did 780 million world wide.

05:14.469 --> 05:16.259
People don't realize that.

05:18.369 --> 05:20.129
Don't you have an iPad?

05:20.419 --> 05:21.229
No...

05:22.109 --> 05:23.779
Um... can we get her an iPad?

05:23.849 --> 05:24.789
Mini?

05:25.429 --> 05:26.399
Load it up?

05:26.399 --> 05:27.669
Watch shit in 3D?

05:27.669 --> 05:29.669
We got great sack in crew jackets.

05:29.989 --> 05:32.559
'I was a Bad Babysitter'
written in gold on the back.

05:32.659 --> 05:34.419
Get your swag on.

05:37.639 --> 05:39.069
So...

05:39.369 --> 05:41.389
How did you get AIDS, Cammy?

05:43.319 --> 05:44.399
Umm...

05:44.679 --> 05:46.739
I don't have AIDS, its...

05:46.799 --> 05:48.629
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

05:55.399 --> 05:56.919
You know what
I'm going to do?

05:57.089 --> 05:59.339
I'm gonna make a movie of your life.

05:59.379 --> 06:00.049
Right?

06:00.089 --> 06:01.819
Ryan Gosling will play me.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.239
And I'll play you.

06:03.379 --> 06:04.949
You're my date at the Oscars.

06:07.829 --> 06:09.289
Non-Hodgekin's?

06:09.319 --> 06:10.229
Sorry about that.

06:10.279 --> 06:12.809
- What the fuck is Non-Hodgekin's?
- I think it's a blood thing.

06:13.449 --> 06:16.009
I mean, 'Non'.
It either is or isn't.

06:16.429 --> 06:17.859
Were you serious in there?

06:17.909 --> 06:18.699
Because...

06:18.699 --> 06:20.389
...we can definitely get this to Ryan.

06:20.439 --> 06:22.433
- It's just the kind of stuff he likes to do.
- We could get it to Ryan?

06:22.441 --> 06:22.829
Yeah.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.519
You can barely get
toilet paper to your ass.

06:27.609 --> 06:29.619
Make for an uplifting drama,
wouldn't it?

06:29.709 --> 06:31.239
I mean, I even got a title.

06:31.259 --> 06:32.669
'It's A Horrible Life'.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.189
If you're not serious Benjie,
it's better not to promise.

06:35.189 --> 06:35.539
Hah!

06:35.749 --> 06:38.329
Arnold Kugler Ross has spoken!

06:38.969 --> 06:41.269
Great Rabi, death and dieing.

06:41.319 --> 06:42.399
Man of wisdom.

06:42.429 --> 06:43.959
Zen-fucking-archer!

06:44.629 --> 06:46.369
I got a new nickname for you.

06:46.529 --> 06:48.509
Uzeem Atolerance.

06:50.499 --> 06:51.789
Drop it Benjie.

06:52.549 --> 06:53.879
Drop it?

06:54.209 --> 06:55.769
I have a better idea.

06:55.889 --> 06:58.019
Why don't you show
me your cunt?!

06:58.269 --> 06:59.259
Huh?!

06:59.389 --> 07:00.889
I know you have one.

07:01.179 --> 07:02.829
Jew faggot!

07:10.599 --> 07:11.729
What are they offering?

07:11.729 --> 07:12.729
5 million.

07:13.049 --> 07:14.659
10 points from Cashbury.

07:14.919 --> 07:16.609
What's Genie asking?

07:16.829 --> 07:17.899
8.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.019
20 from dollar one.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.549
What do you think?

07:23.809 --> 07:25.799
I think we have their balls...

07:27.169 --> 07:28.389
Cool.

07:28.729 --> 07:30.909
So um...
when's the audition?

07:31.099 --> 07:33.139
It's not an audition Benjie.
I told you that.

07:33.839 --> 07:35.509
Right. Sorry.

07:36.169 --> 07:38.719
When's the urine test?

07:40.359 --> 07:42.789
The <i>meeting</i> is on Friday at 10.

07:43.729 --> 07:46.329
The studio just want to see that
you're bright eyed and bushy tailed.

07:47.109 --> 07:49.759
But the deals contingent belong to me?

07:49.879 --> 07:51.619
They just want to protect the franchise.

07:51.969 --> 07:53.909
I <i>am</i> the franchise.

07:53.969 --> 07:56.169
Goo-goo-ga-joo.

07:56.529 --> 07:57.629
Stafford, are you gonna to eat?

07:57.669 --> 08:00.769
I was listening to a very interesting tape
of the Dalai Lama on the way home.

08:00.859 --> 08:02.619
Say what you like about politics...

08:02.659 --> 08:04.489
...the <i>man</i> is a pro.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.219
Free Tibet!

08:06.279 --> 08:08.189
Tibet is not free.
Tibet is very expensive.

08:08.189 --> 08:10.519
I have the receipt
from amazon to prove it.

08:10.689 --> 08:11.629
Anyhow...

08:11.669 --> 08:13.549
Buddhists say a prayer...

08:13.549 --> 08:14.839
Is Genie gonna be there?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.209
She thinks it's better not.

08:16.449 --> 08:18.009
I want her there.

08:18.129 --> 08:19.989
Pray... that those that eat...

08:20.029 --> 08:22.939
...the things that are eaten
and the actual eating...

08:23.109 --> 08:25.359
...be universally devote herself.
Don't you love it?

08:26.829 --> 08:28.499
I'm going to my room.

08:29.889 --> 08:31.369
Goo-goo-ga-joo.

08:33.519 --> 08:34.889
<i>Don't mama...</i>

08:35.999 --> 08:37.509
Don't mama...

08:38.409 --> 08:39.979
<i>Don't hurt me like that.</i><i></i>

08:40.058 --> 08:41.448
Don't hurt me like that.

08:41.509 --> 08:42.979
<i>Don't come into my room.</i><i></i>

08:42.979 --> 08:43.889
Don't...

08:43.948 --> 08:45.569
Don't come into my room.

08:46.149 --> 08:47.649
<i>When I'm sleeping.</i>

08:47.679 --> 08:50.429
Don't come into my room
when I'm sleeping.

08:51.029 --> 08:53.739
<i>- I won't let you anymore.</i><i>
- I won't let you anymore.</i>

08:55.559 --> 08:56.519
You mother fucker.

08:56.519 --> 08:58.789
You mother... FUCKER!

08:59.069 --> 09:01.199
You... you hurt me.

09:01.379 --> 09:02.629
How?

09:04.449 --> 09:05.119
How did I hurt you?

09:05.119 --> 09:06.439
I was your little girl...

09:06.439 --> 09:08.439
I was your...
I was your little girl.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.689
And... and you hurt me.

09:12.629 --> 09:13.969
Why did you do it, mama?

09:14.879 --> 09:16.509
Because your parents hurt you?

09:16.509 --> 09:17.609
That's not good enough!

09:17.929 --> 09:19.499
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

09:20.099 --> 09:21.989
Come on, Havana, stop forgetting!

09:22.219 --> 09:24.389
I don't...
I don't care what they did to you.

09:24.659 --> 09:26.759
I wish they'd... killed you.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.069
I... I'd kill you myself, mama.

09:30.039 --> 09:32.519
How... how could you
do that to a child?

09:34.979 --> 09:37.979
How could you do...
what you did to me?

09:40.349 --> 09:42.099
I want to be free Clarice.

09:43.209 --> 09:44.519
I want to be free.

09:45.339 --> 09:46.819
Clarice, mama...

09:47.529 --> 09:49.189
Mama, mama.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.629
Set me free!

09:50.629 --> 09:52.039
I will be free.

09:52.339 --> 09:54.959
We will take back the years you stole.

09:55.229 --> 09:56.569
Please...

09:56.969 --> 09:58.469
Please... please...

09:59.309 --> 10:01.549
I'm gonna press on a
personal history point.

10:03.459 --> 10:04.769
Everything is stored in thighs.

10:04.777 --> 10:05.329
Okay.

10:12.599 --> 10:14.499
Take back the years, Havana.

10:16.299 --> 10:18.169
Take back the years she
stole from that little girl.

10:20.949 --> 10:21.949
Release.

10:30.549 --> 10:32.139
Rebeca, we need to stop.

10:32.289 --> 10:33.619
You're a patient here.

10:33.729 --> 10:35.465
I want to help you,
not make you things...

10:35.461 --> 10:37.169
You don't think I set
those fires, do you?

10:37.879 --> 10:39.629
I think that you didn't mean to.

10:39.929 --> 10:41.789
You need help.
That's all.

10:41.889 --> 10:43.539
Don't you wanna help me?

10:44.039 --> 10:45.459
Not like this.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.689
I think that we need to
think about what we're doing.

11:03.609 --> 11:06.239
On all the flesh that says yes.

11:07.009 --> 11:09.879
On the forehead of all my friends.

11:10.749 --> 11:13.159
On every hand held out.

11:15.029 --> 11:16.889
I write your name.

11:18.559 --> 11:20.949
Ms. Havana?
It's Ms. Genie.

11:34.469 --> 11:37.229
- How you doing, baby?
- Eh, I'm okay.

11:37.229 --> 11:40.149
I really had a session with Stafford.

11:40.169 --> 11:43.269
That is so brave, what you do.

11:44.189 --> 11:46.129
Doesn't feel brave.

11:47.969 --> 11:49.579
I need a new chore whore.

11:49.809 --> 11:51.369
What do...
what happened to Adaggio?

11:51.389 --> 11:53.549
Ahh... I had to fire her.

11:53.579 --> 11:54.849
You're kidding!
What happened?

11:54.869 --> 11:56.309
She was stealing.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.869
Adaggio?!

11:58.269 --> 11:59.739
Oh God, I don't believe it.

11:59.739 --> 12:03.059
Yeah, yeah. She took some money
and a ring I got last year in Paris

12:03.059 --> 12:04.279
and some Vicodin.

12:04.389 --> 12:05.509
Oh my God!

12:05.849 --> 12:07.659
- What did you caught her?
- Um. -hmm.

12:07.929 --> 12:09.429
So what did you call the police?

12:09.429 --> 12:11.519
Yeah, I told her I would
if she didn't go to rehab.

12:12.269 --> 12:13.909
I see that she's there now, huh?

12:13.909 --> 12:16.929
Yeah, with the all the other
dope fiend personal assistants.

12:17.179 --> 12:18.659
They have there own wing.

12:19.549 --> 12:21.829
Okay, well, I call Carry again.

12:21.829 --> 12:26.319
Um, love her, love Carrie
but don't bother her with this shit!

12:26.439 --> 12:27.819
She'll think it's hilarious.

12:27.819 --> 12:29.619
I'm meeting her later at the J.J. Thing.

12:29.619 --> 12:31.619
She'll give me some names.

12:32.539 --> 12:34.509
So, umm...

12:35.999 --> 12:38.339
What's going on with 'Stolen Waters'?

12:38.589 --> 12:41.309
Well, I called Vita but you know,
they're all at Sundance.

12:41.309 --> 12:43.409
Yeah, everyone but me!

12:43.409 --> 12:46.119
I gave the best reading
of my life, Genie!

12:46.139 --> 12:49.169
I went in there and
I blow everyone away!

12:49.319 --> 12:50.969
I know, I know.

12:51.589 --> 12:53.909
I mean, you know,
the only thing I can think of was that

12:53.909 --> 12:58.079
they maybe they have some concerns
about the perception of stunt casting.

12:59.109 --> 13:01.469
Everything is stunt casting.

13:01.789 --> 13:02.749
Havana...

13:02.879 --> 13:05.129
...this is a movie and not a great one...

13:05.159 --> 13:07.509
...that your mother made.
30 years ago!

13:07.509 --> 13:09.329
No, no.
But it could be... it could be...

13:09.369 --> 13:11.869
Great! It's a, it's a re-imagining.

13:11.869 --> 13:13.179
It's a fucking art film!

13:13.179 --> 13:15.629
I mean, who do you think
came up with the idea of

13:15.629 --> 13:18.369
my mother looking back on
the making of 'Stolen Waters'

13:18.369 --> 13:20.439
if she had lived?
I did. I did!

13:20.439 --> 13:23.089
I mentioned it to Damien
4 years ago in Mystique.

13:23.089 --> 13:23.899
I know, I know.

13:23.899 --> 13:24.869
They should give me the part.

13:24.869 --> 13:27.819
And, and a producers credit too.
I mean this role was...

13:27.899 --> 13:29.809
...made for best supporting. It's...

13:29.849 --> 13:32.509
It's... it's a fucking second chance.

13:32.509 --> 13:34.559
And it's, it's Damien Javitz.

13:34.559 --> 13:36.559
He totally resurrects actors.

13:36.739 --> 13:38.529
And I went in there and I killed it.

13:40.929 --> 13:42.629
Sterl still doing it?

13:43.679 --> 13:44.649
Yeah...

13:44.849 --> 13:46.199
Yeah, he owes me.

13:46.489 --> 13:47.909
I introduced him to Harvey and

13:47.909 --> 13:51.239
you know Harvey is producing and I mean,
I already talked to Harvey and

13:51.369 --> 13:54.039
He's gonna to talk to Damien
but you know...

13:54.509 --> 13:56.109
Harvey is Harvey, but...

13:57.179 --> 13:58.989
Sterl can talk to Damien?

13:59.129 --> 14:01.549
You know we are doing
everything we can but

14:01.549 --> 14:03.549
you know, at the end of the day,
it's an art film.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.809
I mean it will be great if you got the job.

14:06.069 --> 14:07.599
But in case you're not aware

14:07.599 --> 14:10.069
your mother is a dead cult figure.

14:10.509 --> 14:12.069
A Damien Javitz.

14:12.479 --> 14:14.389
8 P.D. Andersson.

14:14.749 --> 14:16.619
I mean they're so many movies out there!

14:16.619 --> 14:17.409
Yeah, where?!

14:17.409 --> 14:18.999
- Big deal movies!
- Where?

14:19.049 --> 14:20.609
Where? Where Genie?!

14:20.609 --> 14:22.609
Do you know what Jacob said
to me the other day?

14:22.609 --> 14:25.429
He said that because
I know so many celebrities

14:25.429 --> 14:27.849
I should consider becoming a manager!

14:27.849 --> 14:30.169
Do you know,
do you know how it felt

14:30.169 --> 14:31.519
for me to hear that?!

14:31.519 --> 14:33.959
Look, everything I am doing

14:33.959 --> 14:35.769
everything in my life

14:35.789 --> 14:39.259
and in my therapy is to get this part...

14:39.309 --> 14:41.649
- Ow!
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

14:41.649 --> 14:44.039
- Ow, cramps.
- Are you okay?

14:44.059 --> 14:45.549
No, not okay!

15:03.269 --> 15:06.759
Mother daughter incest
is so 80's overkill.

15:07.399 --> 15:09.129
And sexton I am not.

15:09.129 --> 15:11.079
Oh my God. Oh my God!

15:11.629 --> 15:13.399
The shock will wear off.

15:13.859 --> 15:15.569
What's the matter, Havana?

15:15.569 --> 15:17.289
Did you think it would be
like the 'Sixth Sense'

15:17.289 --> 15:19.659
with the dead clambering to be heard?

15:20.229 --> 15:22.669
Do you know what the dead clamber for?

15:22.979 --> 15:24.849
You know what hell is?

15:25.029 --> 15:27.699
A world without narcotics.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.809
What's happening?
What's happening?

15:30.809 --> 15:33.189
Worst pornographically shaven at this

15:33.189 --> 15:35.509
childhood rape fantasy.
Get a life!

15:36.799 --> 15:38.749
Maybe you should get a dad.

15:39.089 --> 15:42.269
Isn't it pathetic enough
that you want to play me?

15:42.269 --> 15:44.509
You HATE me.

15:44.599 --> 15:46.889
That yet you are desperate to be me?

15:49.069 --> 15:52.069
You want that role
that you're not gonna get.

15:53.029 --> 15:54.769
You don't even have the chops.

15:55.159 --> 15:58.469
I did.
And I was young and gorgeous.

15:58.559 --> 15:59.319
You?!

15:59.349 --> 16:02.209
With your shitty tits and
that used up old hole!

16:02.209 --> 16:04.079
It STINKS worse than me!

16:04.079 --> 16:07.109
No! No...

16:26.049 --> 16:27.529
Who is it?

16:35.249 --> 16:36.869
It's Non-Hodgkin's.

16:37.699 --> 16:39.309
What are you doing here?

16:42.289 --> 16:44.539
On my school notebooks.

16:44.759 --> 16:46.879
On my desk, in the trees.

16:47.189 --> 16:49.229
On the sand, in the snow.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.569
I write your name.

16:55.509 --> 16:57.519
I'll... I'll make the movie.

16:57.689 --> 17:00.749
If that's why you're here.
I don't know what Marlon told you...

17:00.749 --> 17:03.549
On all the flesh that says yes.

17:03.959 --> 17:07.549
On the forehead of my friends.
On every hand held out.

17:07.909 --> 17:09.648
I write your name.

17:15.269 --> 17:17.329
In my school notebook.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.329
On my desk and on the trees.

17:19.829 --> 17:22.888
On the sand and
in the snow, I write your name.

17:23.388 --> 17:25.339
On all the flesh that says yes.

17:25.339 --> 17:27.339
On the forehead of my friends.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.649
On every hand held out,
I write your name.

17:30.329 --> 17:31.369
Liberty.

17:49.309 --> 17:52.239
So, we're back to school with 'Bad Babysitters'.

17:53.449 --> 17:55.009
Is this detention?

17:55.009 --> 17:57.009
No way, you're top of the class.

17:57.309 --> 17:59.879
We understand you had
a rocky summer vacation.

18:00.009 --> 18:00.989
Unproductive one.

18:01.249 --> 18:02.309
Wasn't easy.

18:03.099 --> 18:04.339
For any of us.

18:05.259 --> 18:06.579
But he's learned a lot.

18:08.309 --> 18:09.869
Absolutely.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.889
Yeah, listen, I went through
that whole drug thing myself.

18:12.889 --> 18:14.889
I mean... not at your age.

18:14.939 --> 18:17.579
Like you but... shit happens.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.199
Right, it just ahh...

18:19.409 --> 18:21.349
...happens a lot earlier
than it used to.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.639
Benjie's done a lot of growing up.

18:24.639 --> 18:26.319
Yes, he has.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.849
Uh, on the last season of

18:28.849 --> 18:31.989
'Prince Lords' I was making
300000 a week.

18:32.749 --> 18:34.389
I was 9 years old.

18:34.649 --> 18:36.319
How psychotic is that?

18:36.319 --> 18:38.319
Crazy money.

18:38.319 --> 18:39.629
For anyone

18:39.629 --> 18:41.179
But worth every penny.

18:41.179 --> 18:43.179
You've got a tremendous
fanbase out there.

18:43.459 --> 18:45.179
I just didn't have the skills.

18:45.179 --> 18:47.639
That kind of income
would fuck up Mother Teresa.

18:47.839 --> 18:49.439
She's already fucked up.

18:49.499 --> 18:51.889
She's dead.
That's how fucked up she is.

18:55.459 --> 18:56.769
We have a mandate.

18:57.109 --> 18:59.769
Christina knows this and I,
I know you do too.

19:00.069 --> 19:01.769
We have to protect the franchise.

19:02.369 --> 19:03.419
Goo-goo-ga-joo.

19:04.319 --> 19:06.119
Only kept things quiet last year.

19:06.289 --> 19:08.449
Arnold, your people were terrific.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.249
Nothing from the tabloids.

19:10.249 --> 19:11.159
Yeah still...

19:11.159 --> 19:15.173
You know, an adult recovery can be a career boost but
with a child it's something else.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.505
I think we understand that, Chip.

19:18.049 --> 19:20.159
Though, ah, it didn't hurt Drew.

19:20.269 --> 19:20.879
Hm?

19:21.909 --> 19:22.879
Guys...

19:23.839 --> 19:24.879
We're on your side.

19:24.879 --> 19:26.009
Please understand that.

19:26.609 --> 19:30.489
I don't think we'd all be in this room
if didn't feel a certain level of trust.

19:33.779 --> 19:35.069
Do we have a budget yet?

19:35.259 --> 19:37.499
Ah, 58,
but that's strictly in house.

19:37.499 --> 19:40.689
Yeah, we lost Elle but, eh,
she's not someone we were counting on.

19:41.209 --> 19:43.869
We're closing with Emma Watson
for the young mom so uh...

19:44.229 --> 19:45.869
That should be fun.

19:47.869 --> 19:50.829
We need to know the
circumstances of Benjie's rehab.

19:52.309 --> 19:53.509
Uh Benjie...

19:53.509 --> 19:55.509
Detox in a private home.

19:55.509 --> 19:57.509
The ranch of my husbands partner.

19:58.679 --> 20:00.419
Kick-ass mom you got there.

20:01.099 --> 20:01.769
Um.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.679
She knows how to hit
without leaving marks on the body.

20:22.929 --> 20:24.009
Fuck.

20:26.949 --> 20:29.199
I will never be humiliated like...

20:29.469 --> 20:31.099
...like that again.

20:31.159 --> 20:32.039
Never.

20:33.109 --> 20:35.049
It's over, baby.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.259
We have them.

20:38.639 --> 20:40.579
Did Damien told I was too old?

20:40.579 --> 20:41.439
Mm-mm.

20:41.709 --> 20:43.209
The casting people.

20:43.239 --> 20:44.209
Sarah Horowitz?

20:44.209 --> 20:45.429
Havana, come on.

20:45.479 --> 20:46.969
The part's just written younger.

20:47.529 --> 20:50.139
Sarah Horowitz cast me
in my very first movie.

20:50.879 --> 20:51.789
Mm.

20:52.179 --> 20:55.009
Probably saw that
thing I did on TNT for money.

20:55.009 --> 20:57.269
Yeah, well, don't do anything for money.

20:57.269 --> 20:59.439
Yeah, well we all haven't
been as smart as you.

21:01.199 --> 21:03.179
You gonna support me on this, Sterl?

21:03.759 --> 21:05.849
Are you gonna support me with Damien?

21:06.079 --> 21:07.639
Look, you know I will.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.789
I think he's taking
a hard look Azita Wachtel.

21:14.789 --> 21:16.199
Azita Wachtel?

21:16.219 --> 21:19.079
Well, she's nominated
for an Oscar and she's Canadian.

21:19.079 --> 21:20.009
Canada is co-funding.

21:20.009 --> 21:23.109
Do you know that Azita Wachtel story is?
Do you know what she's known for?

21:23.769 --> 21:27.029
She used to let producers stick
their cocks in her ass and pee.

21:27.669 --> 21:28.929
Good to know.

21:30.529 --> 21:33.139
Look, you have a relationship with Damien.

21:33.139 --> 21:35.359
Yeah, I've 3 calls in to him
but he won't return.

21:35.359 --> 21:37.029
You gave a great reading.

21:37.939 --> 21:39.129
He tell you that?

21:39.239 --> 21:41.189
He said you were very strong.

21:41.189 --> 21:43.049
He did, he said that?

21:43.049 --> 21:44.069
Yes.

21:44.489 --> 21:45.929
Oh my God!

21:45.929 --> 21:48.449
Oh, Sterl!
I have to get this part!

21:48.669 --> 21:50.269
We'd be so great together!

21:50.269 --> 21:52.269
Why, I thought we already were?

21:54.589 --> 21:55.459
Diandra?

21:55.459 --> 21:57.599
Oh my God! She's old!

21:57.599 --> 21:59.599
Hey, did you know she's like 23?

21:59.599 --> 22:01.229
I heard that she's 16.

22:01.239 --> 22:02.389
How do you know she's 23?

22:02.599 --> 22:03.759
Her labia is pierced.

22:03.759 --> 22:06.109
You gotto be 23 to
have your labia pierced?

22:06.109 --> 22:08.179
Now she's got a
tramp stamp... okay, she's

22:08.179 --> 22:09.779
menopausal!

22:11.099 --> 22:12.959
Hey, nice girls, huh?

22:12.959 --> 22:14.429
Oh my God.
Rhett did you tell him?

22:14.429 --> 22:16.159
Oh, bet you won't believe this.

22:16.159 --> 22:17.769
No, nah, no,
it's too fucking weird.

22:17.769 --> 22:20.389
- I'm not going to this.
- Now I'm getting interested.

22:20.389 --> 22:22.269
Okay, so there's this crazy girl, right?

22:22.269 --> 22:24.279
She's posted like 6000 messages on my

22:24.279 --> 22:25.969
Facebook fan page in like 2 months.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.489
Sounds like marriage material.

22:27.489 --> 22:28.909
You should just fuck her, right?

22:28.909 --> 22:30.389
Or eat her on her period.

22:30.389 --> 22:31.449
Come on, don't be vulgar.

22:31.449 --> 22:33.449
Yeah, Bri won't even do that to me.

22:33.449 --> 22:34.539
Well he can't.

22:34.609 --> 22:35.979
Because your menopausal!

22:35.979 --> 22:37.469
- Oh!
- Shut up!

22:37.469 --> 22:38.959
- Come on, we...

22:39.689 --> 22:41.629
Would you guys chill,
come on.

22:41.629 --> 22:44.319
Alright, so,
production company looks into it and

22:44.319 --> 22:47.819
finds out a teenster's been selling this chick
my shit for like 3000 dollars.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.829
Excuse me, your shit?

22:49.829 --> 22:51.829
Yeah, you heard it right girl, my shit.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.089
He's got some expensive doody.

22:54.459 --> 22:56.669
It's got rice in it from uh...

22:56.669 --> 22:57.929
Noboo!

22:59.809 --> 23:01.159
Like out of a honey wagon?

23:01.159 --> 23:03.989
No, like... um... when the guy
comes in with the hose

23:03.989 --> 23:05.239
...empty... you know...

23:05.239 --> 23:06.709
What is she doing with it?

23:06.709 --> 23:08.929
Stock pilling... for that rainy day.

23:09.369 --> 23:11.269
Okay, like, where did she get the money?

23:11.609 --> 23:12.449
Slush fund.

23:12.449 --> 23:15.089
Oh! Benjie you are so sick!

23:15.089 --> 23:18.009
There are some days, I actually,
I ran specials when I had diarrhea.

23:18.459 --> 23:21.579
- Summer clearance.
- Everything must go!

23:21.719 --> 23:22.779
Oh my God!

23:25.129 --> 23:26.289
Come...

23:26.879 --> 23:28.139
Who is that?

23:28.139 --> 23:30.449
Starla Gent, country singer.

23:30.449 --> 23:32.469
- She won the voice?
- Nah, she's runner up.

23:32.469 --> 23:34.469
God, she is a wild woman.

23:34.469 --> 23:36.459
Uh, hell of an actress, as well.

23:36.459 --> 23:37.529
Didn't I tell you?

23:37.939 --> 23:39.749
Javitz cast her in the part you wanted.

23:39.749 --> 23:40.859
Shut up!

23:42.349 --> 23:44.749
Ah, I wonder if
Blake Sheldon pied in that butt.

23:46.909 --> 23:48.169
Hey, you like Sam?

23:48.629 --> 23:49.359
Um.

23:49.589 --> 23:51.359
You could totally fuck her.

23:51.359 --> 23:54.779
She wants to be in your movie.
I hear she gets great Oxy too.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.479
I've almost got 90 days.

23:57.489 --> 23:58.089
To what?

23:58.089 --> 24:00.089
Sobriety, you dick-wad!

24:00.089 --> 24:03.439
Oh, my God!
The human stench.

24:03.439 --> 24:06.599
Fat, anchor whore from TNT
was in the bathroom. We saw her ankles.

24:07.099 --> 24:08.819
What was her name again?

24:08.819 --> 24:10.819
It was like something Dead Farted.

24:12.669 --> 24:15.169
Hey, isn't that Sterl Carruth?

24:15.599 --> 24:17.689
Oh yeah, with Havana Segrand.

24:17.929 --> 24:19.399
We have the same agent.

24:19.399 --> 24:21.019
How old is she?

24:21.079 --> 24:22.929
Totally menopausal.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.119
Oh, beyond! She's near death!

24:25.119 --> 24:26.649
She's like older than my grandmother.

24:26.649 --> 24:30.059
Oh, she is. She MILF.
Grandmother I like to fuck.

24:31.779 --> 24:32.839
Are they fucking?

24:32.839 --> 24:34.659
Ah, she'd be like a mercy fuck.

24:34.659 --> 24:37.239
Like when orderlies rape
old people in nursing homes.

24:38.269 --> 24:40.249
Hey, didn't her mom die in a fire?

24:40.249 --> 24:41.179
Yeah!

24:41.179 --> 24:42.469
Like Jack Cassidy.

24:42.469 --> 24:43.469
Who's that?

24:43.939 --> 24:46.839
The prodigal swinger.
David Cassidy's father.

24:46.839 --> 24:47.849
Who's David Cassidy?

24:47.869 --> 24:49.079
Sean Cassidy's brother.

24:49.479 --> 24:53.029
You know her mom was
really cool actress as well, um...

24:53.029 --> 24:55.029
...Clarice Taggart?

24:55.419 --> 24:56.379
Yeah, um...

24:56.729 --> 24:59.439
Annie did a thing on her.
She was really cool!

24:59.529 --> 25:01.029
She was young.

25:10.089 --> 25:11.869
Who is that?!

25:12.479 --> 25:13.229
Fuck.

25:13.479 --> 25:14.559
Fuck.

25:21.949 --> 25:23.619
Hey, Damien, what's happening?

25:24.889 --> 25:27.149
Yeah, yeah, I could totally wear 2 earrings.

25:27.339 --> 25:28.809
I love that.

25:29.349 --> 25:32.669
Um, Maestro, I'm just, eh...

25:32.769 --> 25:35.949
I'm just here with the kids.
Doing the whole bedtime story thing.

25:35.949 --> 25:37.799
Can I... can I call you back?

25:40.989 --> 25:44.429
Um, yeah, no, I'll, yeah,
I'll call you right back first thing.

25:44.429 --> 25:45.469
Hey!

25:45.999 --> 25:48.299
Mention me when... you talk!

25:48.299 --> 25:50.299
You are so fucking crazed.

25:50.719 --> 25:53.369
Suck my dick and I'll put in a word.

26:03.569 --> 26:06.129
I loved you so much.

26:06.389 --> 26:10.289
You were such
a beautiful little girl but you lied.

26:10.559 --> 26:13.689
How could you grow up
to be a monster who lies?

26:18.589 --> 26:19.759
Fuck.

26:29.789 --> 26:30.349
Hey!

26:34.829 --> 26:36.079
What's happening?

26:37.419 --> 26:38.719
I'm sorry, it's...

26:40.339 --> 26:42.449
I just got uncomfortable.

26:43.679 --> 26:45.739
I guess I'm a lousy dyke.

26:46.949 --> 26:48.509
Why don't you take a Klonopin?

27:01.239 --> 27:02.499
I know a man...

27:02.549 --> 27:04.999
...who lives under the sword of Damocles...

27:05.099 --> 27:06.539
...we call aids.

27:06.539 --> 27:08.789
'When my time comes', he told me...

27:09.329 --> 27:10.619
I'll be ready.

27:10.899 --> 27:12.859
My bags are packed

27:12.919 --> 27:14.339
and at the door.

27:14.749 --> 27:15.709
I like that.

27:16.029 --> 27:17.989
I like that very much.

27:18.059 --> 27:21.139
There is a time in
our lives and in out therapies

27:21.139 --> 27:23.139
when out eyes stray

27:23.139 --> 27:25.139
to the bags at the door.

27:25.139 --> 27:26.449
After we wept.

27:26.809 --> 27:31.429
After we have suffered.
After we have exhausted the fountain of memory.

27:31.529 --> 27:33.189
Bloodied our hands.

27:33.189 --> 27:35.189
In the walls of our parents house.

27:35.339 --> 27:37.629
I thought that
Gary Marshall was gonna be there.

27:37.649 --> 27:40.099
And it was a meet.
I didn't know I was gonna have to read.

27:40.099 --> 27:43.089
And then they gave me
the wrong drive-on and I had to walk like a mile.

27:43.089 --> 27:44.859
And I stank by the time I got there.

27:44.859 --> 27:46.929
And then the casting director, who I know

27:46.929 --> 27:48.109
doesn't even acknowledge me.

27:48.109 --> 27:50.989
She just walks right by
without saying a word and...

27:51.879 --> 27:53.009
...and then she tells me...

27:53.009 --> 27:54.969
She doesn't even know if
Gary even knows I'm coming in.

27:54.969 --> 27:57.419
You know this is Gary Marshall,
not Berdalucci.

27:57.419 --> 27:59.869
His movies don't make
money any more and I know Gary.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.259
And then she says they
want to put me on tape

28:02.269 --> 28:04.759
and I'm like, excuse me but
you need special make-up for that

28:04.759 --> 28:05.989
or you look green and she says

28:05.989 --> 28:07.389
well you can either tape or not!

28:07.389 --> 28:11.399
Like it's all some pointless exercise and
I just can't take it anymore, Jacob!

28:11.399 --> 28:14.339
I'm so tired and it's so pathetic!

28:15.059 --> 28:16.349
Is that Carrie?

28:16.849 --> 28:18.879
Later Jacob. They're here.

28:18.939 --> 28:21.659
Hi Carrie!

28:23.309 --> 28:25.419
How are you?

28:25.459 --> 28:29.379
Oh, when I get in touch with
myself I'll let you know.

28:29.379 --> 28:30.819
It's been insane.

28:30.819 --> 28:31.849
Did you rap?

28:32.009 --> 28:35.039
Well, we go back to Prague
tomorrow to do re-shoots.

28:35.039 --> 28:36.449
Are you doing the Javitz film?

28:36.449 --> 28:38.529
Oh, I hope so.
Did you hear something?

28:38.529 --> 28:40.949
Well, Genie told me you were up for it.

28:40.949 --> 28:44.929
That would be so amazing
for you to play your own mother.

28:44.929 --> 28:45.599
I mean...

28:45.599 --> 28:48.119
Every daughter should have
that opportunity, right?

28:48.169 --> 28:50.589
Do you know Damien?

28:50.649 --> 28:53.409
Well, we just...
had dinner once in Tangeers.

28:53.409 --> 28:56.769
Well, if you see him,
tell him to hire me.

28:57.859 --> 28:59.969
Oh, Genie told me about Adaggio.

28:59.969 --> 29:02.419
Eh, how long did she work for you?

29:02.419 --> 29:03.629
3 years.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.859
Are you still looking for a new assistant?

29:05.859 --> 29:08.079
Absolutely, you've become
my employment agency.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.549
Would you do me a big favor?

29:09.549 --> 29:11.549
This is gonna sound bizarre but...

29:11.549 --> 29:14.999
Would you interview this girl
that I met on the Internet?

29:15.569 --> 29:17.109
I'm so nervous.

29:17.109 --> 29:19.109
Naw, it's okay.

29:19.109 --> 29:20.569
Do you like some tea?

29:20.569 --> 29:22.569
Oh, thank you, yes.

29:25.299 --> 29:27.769
Your house is so beautiful.

29:28.229 --> 29:31.439
Walls are so thick and those chimes.

29:31.439 --> 29:34.779
Oh, their from a monastery
in Dharamsala.

29:34.979 --> 29:36.829
I met the Dalai Lama.

29:36.909 --> 29:39.439
He's very cool man.

29:39.759 --> 29:42.289
He laughs a lot and he's...

29:42.459 --> 29:46.429
actually just like someone you
wanna hang with, you know?

29:46.429 --> 29:49.119
But, you can't cause
he's the Dalai Lama!

29:50.749 --> 29:52.399
Thank you for the tea.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.879
Marie is at the hospital.

29:54.909 --> 29:56.109
My housekeeper.

29:56.149 --> 29:59.899
One of her girls is sick.
She's got like, you know, 40 kids.

30:00.109 --> 30:02.029
So...

30:02.029 --> 30:03.899
I guess you know why you're here.

30:03.899 --> 30:05.899
Mm, because of Carrie.

30:05.969 --> 30:07.689
How did you guys start e-mailing?

30:07.689 --> 30:09.749
Well, she wrote on Twitter that she was

30:09.749 --> 30:11.749
researching for a
new novel she was writing.

30:11.749 --> 30:13.749
About a burn girl so...

30:13.749 --> 30:17.229
I wrote to her and then I met her
at a Star Wars convention in Florida.

30:17.849 --> 30:20.479
Was that weird for you, I mean...

30:20.569 --> 30:24.549
She's so amazing.
You know, she's such a funny, amazing person.

30:24.549 --> 30:27.989
Plus we both have dual disorders,
we finish each others sentences.

30:27.989 --> 30:29.989
So you came out here to see her?

30:30.819 --> 30:33.069
I just wanted to see Hollywood.

30:33.069 --> 30:35.869
But she said she'd take me to
breakfast at the 4 Seasons.

30:36.119 --> 30:38.119
Zooey Deschanel was there.

30:38.239 --> 30:40.789
And Sally Draper,
the little girl from Mad Men.

30:40.789 --> 30:42.179
It was pretty amazing.

30:42.889 --> 30:44.389
Do you have family?

30:44.549 --> 30:46.529
In Florida, that's where I'm from.

30:48.769 --> 30:51.249
Agatha, um...

30:52.009 --> 30:54.059
Can I ask about the burn?

30:56.949 --> 30:58.019
Ah...

30:58.019 --> 31:00.709
I was working in
a planetarium after school...

31:01.199 --> 31:02.719
I was 12.

31:02.719 --> 31:07.009
There was an electrical fire and
I ran into a store room.

31:07.349 --> 31:09.009
Like a jerk...

31:11.719 --> 31:14.429
Mm... um... well...

31:15.099 --> 31:18.009
This isn't a very glamorous job.

31:18.399 --> 31:20.299
I'm not used to glamor.

31:20.329 --> 31:21.859
Mm, you'd be like

31:21.859 --> 31:26.149
mostly running errands, going shopping
and getting things fixed and...

31:26.149 --> 31:29.849
Ms. Segrand, I would be
the most loyal, most competent,

31:29.849 --> 31:32.809
most grateful personal assistant
you've ever had.

31:33.539 --> 31:34.919
You don't have a car?

31:36.089 --> 31:37.299
But you drive?

31:37.549 --> 31:39.809
I have a valid Florida license.

31:40.369 --> 31:42.109
Mm, we can rent you a car.

31:42.269 --> 31:43.639
I think maybe...

31:43.849 --> 31:45.699
Mustang, or something.

31:48.929 --> 31:50.899
Carrie's so funny.

31:51.629 --> 31:53.939
She knew I should meet you.

31:56.149 --> 31:58.169
Do you know how my mother died?

31:58.949 --> 32:00.089
No.

32:01.759 --> 32:03.249
In a fire.

32:04.439 --> 32:05.369
Oh.

32:09.319 --> 32:10.879
Agatha.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.429
I think you're beautiful.

32:22.029 --> 32:24.419
And do you know
who looks just like you?

32:25.239 --> 32:26.499
Inside?

32:29.139 --> 32:30.519
Havana Segrand.

32:36.049 --> 32:37.489
We got a request.

32:37.729 --> 32:38.399
What is it?

32:38.449 --> 32:41.719
Hollywood tour. Cash call.
Holly Prest Hotel.

33:01.029 --> 33:02.569
On my school notebook.

33:02.569 --> 33:04.569
On my desk and on the trees.

33:04.569 --> 33:06.569
On the sand and in the snow,
I write your name.

33:07.609 --> 33:09.659
On all the flesh that says yes.

33:09.659 --> 33:13.939
On the forehead of my friends,
on every hand held out, I write your name.

33:15.089 --> 33:16.339
Liberty.

33:20.559 --> 33:22.319
So you were in a fire, right?

33:22.879 --> 33:24.779
You know, I never really
figured out what happened.

33:24.779 --> 33:28.259
I think, one night I got drunk and
slept really hard on my face.

33:32.519 --> 33:35.119
So, now you hit Tinseltown,
what are you gonna do?

33:36.319 --> 33:37.419
Can't ah...

33:37.449 --> 33:39.569
...keep riding around in limos
if you want to keep your money.

33:39.679 --> 33:41.099
Actually, I got a job.

33:41.909 --> 33:43.219
Oh yeah, where?

33:43.289 --> 33:44.809
Do you know Havana Segrand?

33:44.809 --> 33:46.559
Sure. Know of.

33:46.659 --> 33:48.509
I'm her new personal assistant.

33:49.329 --> 33:50.379
That's the...

33:50.469 --> 33:52.029
Carrie Fisher connection?

33:52.099 --> 33:53.509
Actually it was.

33:54.509 --> 33:57.039
Havana is getting me a car.

34:01.089 --> 34:03.379
Hey, do you wanna have
dinner on the weekend?

34:05.909 --> 34:07.009
Um...

34:07.399 --> 34:10.199
Yeah, this weekend is
not good for me I have to ah...

34:10.579 --> 34:12.129
...I have to work on my script.

34:12.129 --> 34:14.129
I have a great idea for a movie.

34:14.129 --> 34:15.809
Maybe we could write it together?

34:15.829 --> 34:18.799
It's got an incest theme I guess
those are kinda of overdone, huh?

34:18.799 --> 34:20.748
Sex abusing your religion.

34:20.748 --> 34:22.978
The truth is my parents
are brother and sister.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.149
I never tell anyone that.

34:25.268 --> 34:28.349
But I think it would be corny.
It's like, been there, done that.

34:28.438 --> 34:31.018
I know that sounds jaded but
I think it would make a cool indie.

34:31.018 --> 34:33.418
You know, I want to act in it.
And you could too.

34:33.629 --> 34:34.379
Mm...

34:34.379 --> 34:36.549
Think it would be good
if it wasn't pretentious

34:36.549 --> 34:39.619
you know if we got the whole
mythological thing going on.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.168
Uh, look Agatha...

34:48.469 --> 34:50.309
Think you're a little crazy.

34:50.879 --> 34:52.399
Well, so...

34:53.089 --> 34:54.188
I mean...

34:54.969 --> 34:57.069
What I'm saying is um...

34:58.329 --> 35:00.569
I'm kind of,
kind of involved with someone.

35:00.569 --> 35:01.519
And uh...

35:02.319 --> 35:03.509
I mean...

35:03.759 --> 35:05.489
Hope everything works out for you.

35:09.499 --> 35:12.099
Look I don't want to take your money.

35:19.769 --> 35:21.449
Fuck you.

35:39.839 --> 35:41.139
It was...

35:41.289 --> 35:44.709
...like a dream but
it seemed so fucking real.

35:46.209 --> 35:47.209
Go on.

35:49.299 --> 35:51.079
A girl... I ah...

35:51.129 --> 35:52.829
Met her at the hospital.

35:53.149 --> 35:56.389
We sent her an iPad but
they said she died.

35:59.189 --> 36:00.229
Then...

36:00.399 --> 36:03.509
...she came into
my room at the house.

36:03.589 --> 36:05.789
Scared the shit out of me.

36:07.509 --> 36:09.449
Maybe it was a dream.

36:10.589 --> 36:12.729
Am I going crazy?

36:13.599 --> 36:14.319
No.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.499
Well, I...

36:17.509 --> 36:20.989
Think it's probably time for you to
start talking about certain things.

36:22.369 --> 36:23.679
My sister?

36:23.679 --> 36:25.679
Yes.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.799
She always, ah...

36:28.799 --> 36:29.809
...wanted to...

36:29.939 --> 36:30.989
...marry me.

36:31.199 --> 36:32.999
That's how we played.

36:33.339 --> 36:35.219
We did the ceremony.

36:36.919 --> 36:38.439
Isn't that strange?

36:40.769 --> 36:42.539
Think I'm crazy like her?

36:44.089 --> 36:45.209
No.

36:46.389 --> 36:47.579
But...

36:48.569 --> 36:52.509
...if we don't look at things
they can make us crazy.

36:55.399 --> 36:56.769
Mom and dad were...

36:56.869 --> 36:58.279
...at some party...

36:58.789 --> 37:01.249
I was 6 or 7 then.

37:03.229 --> 37:04.289
That night...

37:04.289 --> 37:05.609
...the night it happened...

37:06.059 --> 37:07.149
...we uh...

37:07.429 --> 37:10.379
...had the ceremony, the marriage thing.

37:10.559 --> 37:11.529
And uh...

37:12.639 --> 37:14.389
...she gave me pills...

37:14.699 --> 37:16.209
...vitamins she said...

37:18.889 --> 37:23.329
...and uh, I woke up in the hospital,
they pumped my stomach and...

37:24.169 --> 37:25.319
...the firemen...

37:25.449 --> 37:26.909
...carried me out there...

37:26.999 --> 37:28.419
...and I never saw her again.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.319
- Maybe you asked your parents if they had...
- I did.

37:35.499 --> 37:36.879
They don't talk about her.

37:36.949 --> 37:38.249
They won't.

37:40.159 --> 37:42.249
The girl at the hospital...

37:43.349 --> 37:44.259
Harriet...

37:44.339 --> 37:45.699
...what do I do?

37:47.069 --> 37:49.279
What do I do if she comes back?

37:50.869 --> 37:52.189
You call me.

37:54.859 --> 37:56.589
I'm afraid.

37:56.599 --> 37:58.659
Whenever I see her, it's so...

37:58.729 --> 37:59.839
...real.

37:59.889 --> 38:01.899
I don't want to be hospitalized.

38:01.929 --> 38:04.249
My career is so fucked as it is.

38:04.429 --> 38:06.169
Textbook TSS Havana.

38:06.169 --> 38:08.169
You saw heavy combat as a child.

38:08.239 --> 38:09.619
Could I be a multiple?

38:09.619 --> 38:11.619
I don't see that but if you are,
we'll deal with it.

38:12.499 --> 38:13.829
Damn her!

38:14.009 --> 38:15.639
What does she want?

38:15.799 --> 38:18.969
When you came out of hiding and
externalized your shame...

38:19.169 --> 38:20.549
...mother didn't like that.

38:20.719 --> 38:22.849
But what we can name,
we can tame.

38:23.539 --> 38:25.569
She wants me to fail.

38:25.569 --> 38:27.569
- But I won't.
- I won't.

38:28.449 --> 38:29.569
That's

38:29.569 --> 38:30.639
little Havana.

38:31.169 --> 38:32.549
Celebrate her.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.809
The Imago Deity,
that's what Jung called it.

38:36.029 --> 38:37.029
We call it...

38:37.129 --> 38:38.489
...the magical child.

38:38.599 --> 38:41.599
And that child, will not fail.

38:42.279 --> 38:43.509
Lay down.

38:45.669 --> 38:47.319
I hired a girl.

38:47.499 --> 38:48.939
It's amazing.

38:49.109 --> 38:50.449
Why is it amazing?

38:50.969 --> 38:52.859
She's disfigured.

38:53.219 --> 38:54.429
She was...

38:54.789 --> 38:56.449
...burned in a fire.

38:56.579 --> 38:58.169
On her face...

38:59.509 --> 39:00.689
Where is she from?

39:00.849 --> 39:02.179
Florida.

39:02.879 --> 39:04.069
It's amazing. She just...

39:04.189 --> 39:06.129
...showed up on my doorstep.

39:07.159 --> 39:09.049
I get this sense that I'm...

39:09.189 --> 39:11.819
...working through something
by hiring her.

39:12.779 --> 39:15.769
People don't just enter
our lives randomly, we call them.

39:18.129 --> 39:19.849
Two women linked by fire.

39:22.369 --> 39:24.179
I bet those visions go away.

39:24.339 --> 39:26.109
Oh... God!

39:26.109 --> 39:27.339
Do you think so?

39:27.889 --> 39:30.149
You're welcoming
mom into the house.

39:31.239 --> 39:32.969
You're saying 'Hey, mom'.

39:33.159 --> 39:34.249
'Come on in'.

39:34.569 --> 39:35.929
'You don't scare me.'

39:36.089 --> 39:37.719
'I'm empowered.'

39:37.869 --> 39:39.109
'Soup's on'.

39:39.609 --> 39:41.579
'This is my house, ma'.

39:41.689 --> 39:44.069
'I build it with my pain and my hope'.

39:44.149 --> 39:46.009
'And you can't hurt me anymore'.

39:46.669 --> 39:48.449
'I'm a magical child, ma'.

39:48.569 --> 39:50.009
'So, come on in'.

39:50.419 --> 39:51.369
'Mi casa'

39:51.759 --> 39:53.469
'Es su casa'.

39:53.969 --> 39:55.609
Deep breath now, Havana.

39:56.989 --> 39:58.259
Breathe.

40:22.309 --> 40:24.009
What if she comes to the house?

40:25.759 --> 40:26.849
She won't.

40:26.889 --> 40:29.029
Then what is she doing here?

40:30.409 --> 40:31.889
Maybe she is sightseeing.

40:32.939 --> 40:35.249
Why are you so cavalier about this?

40:37.569 --> 40:40.149
We've always handled
things differently you and I.

40:45.359 --> 40:47.169
You got to get her fired.

40:47.509 --> 40:48.829
And then what?

40:50.529 --> 40:53.329
She's working for Havana.
We know where she is.

40:54.989 --> 40:56.609
And that buys us time.

41:07.279 --> 41:09.859
What if she tries to get to Benjie?!

41:11.169 --> 41:13.189
I'm concerned about the tabloids.

41:16.289 --> 41:19.129
I'm about to go on a
book tour, for Christ sakes!

41:32.559 --> 41:34.079
In my school books.

41:34.079 --> 41:35.229
On my desk.

41:35.229 --> 41:36.309
In the trees.

41:36.309 --> 41:37.649
On the sand, in the snow.

41:37.649 --> 41:39.149
<i>I write your name.</i><i></i>

41:40.849 --> 41:43.019
<i>On all the flesh that says yes.</i>

41:43.569 --> 41:45.479
<i>On the forehead of my friends.</i><i></i>

41:46.179 --> 41:46.969
<i>Son?</i>

41:48.089 --> 41:49.409
One second!

41:51.529 --> 41:52.509
Come in.

41:56.089 --> 41:57.959
Saw your light.

41:59.269 --> 42:00.829
I couldn't sleep.

42:01.979 --> 42:03.169
Me neither.

42:05.229 --> 42:06.819
Were you reading?

42:06.969 --> 42:09.109
Just building up on the script.

42:09.789 --> 42:11.549
That's hard to do without a partner.

42:11.789 --> 42:14.299
Mom usually reads for me but um...

42:14.549 --> 42:18.139
...I like to know lines pretty well
before we go over them.

42:18.579 --> 42:20.309
That's what makes you pro.

42:26.949 --> 42:29.199
Listen there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

42:29.229 --> 42:31.369
I'm not taking anything.

42:31.759 --> 42:33.419
Not even Seroquel.

42:33.649 --> 42:38.019
I've got a really good sponsor.
He's been clean and sober for 20 years.

42:38.319 --> 42:40.389
He's worked with Robert Downey Jr.

42:40.529 --> 42:42.279
- Demi Levato.
- No.

42:47.869 --> 42:49.459
It's about your sister.

42:52.309 --> 42:54.109
We think she may be back.

42:55.639 --> 42:57.219
Here in Los Angeles.

42:59.639 --> 43:01.269
Did... did she call?

43:01.939 --> 43:03.069
She hasn't yet.

43:04.389 --> 43:06.559
Thought she was in prison somewhere.

43:06.629 --> 43:07.459
Hospital.

43:08.769 --> 43:09.859
Far away.

43:10.589 --> 43:12.269
But... now she's...

43:12.919 --> 43:16.089
Free, wild and 18.
Courts couldn't hold her.

43:16.559 --> 43:19.759
We're in the process of acquiring
a restraining order against her.

43:19.759 --> 43:22.469
- And I like you to tell me if she...
- A restraining order?

43:23.969 --> 43:26.669
Too bad you couldn't have gotten
one when she was born.

43:26.899 --> 43:29.889
You could've had a judge
standing by in the delivery room.

43:30.619 --> 43:32.069
Maybe you tried that.

43:32.929 --> 43:35.159
We tried a lot of things, Benjie.

43:36.669 --> 43:38.509
Mostly we tried our best.

43:39.149 --> 43:40.659
That's in your book.

43:41.309 --> 43:43.629
That's a big thing in your book.

43:43.949 --> 43:45.759
Trying your best.

43:46.009 --> 43:48.899
It's supposed to give people major points.

43:51.409 --> 43:53.679
I don't know that girl anymore so...

43:55.699 --> 43:57.349
Not that I ever did.

43:57.829 --> 43:59.599
<i>I don't know if she is dangerous.</i>

44:00.919 --> 44:03.139
<i>I knew this day was coming.</i>

44:03.489 --> 44:05.659
I thought somehow she'd just stay put.

44:06.299 --> 44:08.619
That was stupid... of me.

44:09.919 --> 44:11.649
But I want you to tell me...

44:11.769 --> 44:13.139
...if she tries to see you.

44:14.179 --> 44:16.049
I'll tell you if she pops up.

44:16.409 --> 44:19.249
You know, me and you,
like to share.

44:27.169 --> 44:28.579
Get some sleep son.

44:47.649 --> 44:49.549
By the power of the word...

44:49.709 --> 44:51.429
...I renew my life.

44:51.499 --> 44:53.729
I was born to know you.

44:54.389 --> 44:55.709
And to name you.

44:55.799 --> 44:56.749
Liberty.

44:57.449 --> 44:59.399
<i>Havana, sweetheart, I've...</i>

44:59.879 --> 45:02.969
<i>I don't know if you've</i>
read the trades, but um...

45:03.799 --> 45:06.929
<i>They unannounced that</i>
Damien went with Azita.

45:07.489 --> 45:10.829
<i>I mean I can't say it's a
complete surprise but uh...</i>

45:11.139 --> 45:14.329
<i>I'm very angry at the way it was handled.</i>

45:14.489 --> 45:17.189
<i>I mean it... it... it just makes me</i>
look foolish.

45:17.349 --> 45:19.749
<i>But that's my problem not yours.</i>

45:19.859 --> 45:21.779
<i>I'm so sorry, honey!</i>

45:22.019 --> 45:24.549
<i>I have calls into Damien.</i>

45:24.549 --> 45:27.249
<i>And I hate to be leaving</i>
this on your phone, I...

45:27.349 --> 45:30.149
<i>I... I just didn't want you to</i>
hear it from someone else.

45:30.709 --> 45:34.959
<i>As you know I mean I strongly think</i>
there's no love lost on this project.

45:35.289 --> 45:37.359
<i>Those were always my feelings.</i>

45:38.069 --> 45:42.269
<i>I know and I respect the reasons</i>
why it was so important to you, but I...

45:42.449 --> 45:46.369
<i>I think it's of equal importance</i>
we put this behind us.

45:46.449 --> 45:48.579
<i>So... onward.</i>

45:49.439 --> 45:52.149
<i>I'm messengering 6 scripts</i>

45:52.229 --> 45:56.019
<i>to the house now!</i>
Lots of great stuff on the horizon.

45:56.389 --> 45:58.509
<i>Call me as soon as you get this!</i>

45:58.699 --> 46:00.169
<i>I love you!</i>

46:00.399 --> 46:03.449
<i>And it's gonna be a great year!</i>

46:34.569 --> 46:36.049
Made a hole in the wall.

46:36.239 --> 46:37.629
So we'll be able to see everything.

46:37.759 --> 46:39.929
- Everything?
- Or your money back.

46:40.179 --> 46:43.069
Oh boy! I want to see her va-bina!

46:45.049 --> 46:46.249
And... CUT!

46:57.929 --> 47:00.379
Mr. Va-bina's getting all the laughs.

47:00.439 --> 47:01.719
He's only in 4 scenes.

47:01.719 --> 47:03.719
Yeah and he's stealing every one of them.

47:03.869 --> 47:05.089
Piece of shit.

47:05.499 --> 47:07.089
Would you call Genie?

47:07.259 --> 47:10.649
Call Genie and tell her I want
the little piece of shit flushed.

47:12.399 --> 47:14.089
And... what are you doing here?

47:15.429 --> 47:16.599
I...

47:17.589 --> 47:20.479
I wanted to talk to you about something but,
you know, it could wait.

47:20.479 --> 47:23.339
Not the studio's drug paranoia again?

47:23.529 --> 47:25.999
No, not the studio and their drug paranoia.

47:26.589 --> 47:27.889
<i>Ready for you Benjie!</i>

47:29.419 --> 47:30.649
Fuck off!

47:31.959 --> 47:33.349
I need something to eat.

47:33.349 --> 47:37.429
My blood sugar drops every time I do
a scene with Mr. Piece of Shit Va-bina.

47:41.809 --> 47:45.359
Oh... ma, can you put one of those
breakfast burritos in the microwave.

47:45.439 --> 47:46.929
2 minutes is perfect.

47:58.389 --> 47:59.469
Hey.

48:01.399 --> 48:02.659
How you doing?

48:03.649 --> 48:04.949
I'm cool.

48:05.319 --> 48:07.779
Thought you'd be working on your script.

48:08.499 --> 48:09.749
I wish I was.

48:10.389 --> 48:11.809
Got to pay the bills.

48:12.429 --> 48:13.779
How's your business?

48:17.869 --> 48:19.069
It's alright.

48:19.369 --> 48:21.329
Got a callback from 'Blue Matrix'.

48:22.159 --> 48:23.319
You watch it?

48:24.169 --> 48:25.909
Not into space soaps.

48:28.619 --> 48:29.689
Well...

48:29.949 --> 48:31.099
...it's got a kind of...

48:31.099 --> 48:33.099
...'Battlestar Galactica' thing going on.

48:33.449 --> 48:34.679
Post 9/11.

48:35.299 --> 48:38.459
Can't believe I just spent 18000 dollars.

48:38.459 --> 48:40.739
- Let's go.
- Havana this is Jerome.

48:40.909 --> 48:41.609
Hi.

48:42.029 --> 48:43.479
He's a chauffeur.

48:43.809 --> 48:44.969
Wonderful.

48:46.169 --> 48:49.269
Jerome just got an audition
for 'Battlestar Galactica'.

48:51.249 --> 48:53.389
It's actually... ah... 'Blue Matrix'.

48:54.639 --> 48:55.829
I'm a big fan.

48:56.159 --> 48:58.509
Aww... thank you.

48:58.669 --> 49:00.619
Well um... good luck.

49:03.789 --> 49:04.749
Havana!

49:04.749 --> 49:06.099
Oh my God!

49:06.099 --> 49:08.099
Azita!

49:08.659 --> 49:09.989
Thanks.

49:10.849 --> 49:12.539
Oh...

49:12.729 --> 49:15.399
Mm... uh... Sydney just
told me you were here.

49:15.399 --> 49:17.529
- Uh... I was in the dressing room.
- I was gonna call you.

49:17.529 --> 49:18.779
Congratulations.

49:18.779 --> 49:20.809
Thank you, thank you.
I'm so excited.

49:20.809 --> 49:22.949
You are gonna be so great.

49:22.949 --> 49:24.789
- You think?
- And you're gonna love working with Damien.

49:24.789 --> 49:27.189
Yeah, he's so great.
Um...

49:27.239 --> 49:28.429
Havana!

49:29.269 --> 49:30.479
That makes me feel so good.

49:30.479 --> 49:34.149
Your mother was so special.
It's gonna be a challenge for me.

49:34.289 --> 49:36.189
Uh, I don't want to do impersonations.

49:36.189 --> 49:38.189
Do you know who's gonna
play my mother when she was young?

49:38.259 --> 49:39.209
Anne...

49:40.559 --> 49:41.769
...Hathaway.

49:43.269 --> 49:44.729
How's that gonna work?

49:45.009 --> 49:46.749
Oh, oh, you'd love Anne.

49:46.749 --> 49:48.259
Do you know her?
She... she's amazing.

49:48.259 --> 49:51.579
Aww... just... just make it your own.

49:51.869 --> 49:53.859
You know, for a heartbeat...

49:54.529 --> 49:56.769
I really wanted to do it.
Isn't that insane?

49:56.769 --> 49:57.909
Well, you should have!

49:57.909 --> 50:00.269
But then I was like,
work it out in therapy, bitch!

50:02.489 --> 50:03.929
Aww...

50:04.179 --> 50:06.119
So adorable!

50:07.069 --> 50:08.309
What's your name?

50:08.309 --> 50:10.449
Uh, this is Micah.

50:10.449 --> 50:11.729
Say hi to Havana.

50:11.729 --> 50:14.999
Hi Micah.
You are so sweet!

50:15.029 --> 50:16.119
My shy guy.

50:16.119 --> 50:18.989
- Oh... what a heart breaker.
- Yeah.

50:18.989 --> 50:19.859
Yeah...

50:20.279 --> 50:22.089
Well, great to see you.

50:22.089 --> 50:23.819
Yeah, you too.

50:23.919 --> 50:26.009
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

50:26.109 --> 50:27.599
Um, back in 10.

50:27.869 --> 50:29.589
Okay... go sweetie.

50:54.489 --> 50:55.909
Thank you, Luma.

50:57.669 --> 50:59.339
Can you let yourself out?

51:11.409 --> 51:13.589
I like your new chore whore.

51:14.859 --> 51:17.269
Awful phrase isn't it?

51:17.719 --> 51:20.069
You two have a lot in common.

51:20.159 --> 51:22.489
Like terrible men for one.

51:23.459 --> 51:24.689
Hey ma...

51:24.689 --> 51:26.199
I'm empowered.

51:26.319 --> 51:28.169
Soups on.

51:28.289 --> 51:31.809
I'm a magical child, ma,
so come on in.

51:31.999 --> 51:33.769
Mi casa es su casa.

51:33.859 --> 51:35.569
What do you want?

51:35.859 --> 51:37.869
This bravado of mine.

51:38.009 --> 51:40.359
It's asinine and I'm sorry.

51:41.139 --> 51:42.869
It's just...

51:43.029 --> 51:45.299
...I'm nervous around you.

51:45.749 --> 51:48.739
It's sounds comical but
I'm not used to being around people.

51:48.739 --> 51:50.429
I'm not gonna listen to this.

51:50.729 --> 51:53.889
Those incidents you keep
sharing on the talk shows...

51:54.299 --> 51:55.959
...they're falls memories.

51:56.019 --> 51:57.009
Liar!

51:57.119 --> 51:58.659
From day one, liar!

51:58.869 --> 52:01.009
Your stepfather must have done
those things to you.

52:01.009 --> 52:02.679
Why couldn't I see it?

52:03.709 --> 52:06.989
His first wife warned me
that he was like that.

52:07.819 --> 52:12.169
You must have been so angry
at me for not protecting you.

52:12.219 --> 52:15.259
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away.

52:19.209 --> 52:22.109
You blame yourself for
the night I burned, don't you?

52:22.349 --> 52:24.269
This is my house, ma.

52:24.769 --> 52:26.169
I built it.

52:26.649 --> 52:29.059
My pain and my hell.

52:29.489 --> 52:32.529
And you can't hurt me anymore.

52:39.219 --> 52:40.849
I'm sorry.

52:41.579 --> 52:43.529
I just got uncomfortable.

52:45.279 --> 52:47.689
I guess I'm a lousy dyke.

53:03.499 --> 53:04.689
Hi.

53:05.939 --> 53:07.419
Are you okay?

53:07.969 --> 53:09.509
I have the flu.

53:10.509 --> 53:12.389
I need cigarettes.

53:12.789 --> 53:14.679
American Spirit and...

53:15.719 --> 53:17.929
I need you to pick up some prescriptions.

53:18.019 --> 53:21.999
Avian. Vicodin. Xanex. Zoloft.

53:22.389 --> 53:24.949
And Astragalus and Goldenseal.

53:25.009 --> 53:26.269
And um...

53:27.009 --> 53:28.289
Yogi-tea.

53:29.269 --> 53:30.669
Agatha.

53:30.939 --> 53:32.629
Do you know Stafford Weiss?

53:33.409 --> 53:34.619
The therapist?

53:35.389 --> 53:36.129
No.

53:36.569 --> 53:38.709
No... course you don't.

53:38.889 --> 53:42.119
Why should you?
I'm getting information from a fucking dead person.

53:42.319 --> 53:45.269
Tampax... I need Tampax and um...

53:45.399 --> 53:46.339
And...

53:46.759 --> 53:49.119
Kozy Shack?
You know what Kozy Shack is?

53:49.119 --> 53:50.789
Comes in these big tubs, like...

53:50.939 --> 53:53.269
Tapioca... rice pudding...

53:54.219 --> 53:56.709
And truffles from Masion du Chocolat.

53:56.709 --> 53:58.929
You can... you can got those at, um...

53:58.979 --> 54:00.389
...at Neimens.

54:00.509 --> 54:02.339
And um... come out to the yard.

54:02.479 --> 54:05.369
Um uh... I need...
I need to move some plants.

54:13.669 --> 54:15.699
They've been like this since the fucking earthquake.

54:15.699 --> 54:18.049
And I just...
I want to move them over there.

54:18.169 --> 54:19.539
Don't worry about the tiles

54:19.549 --> 54:22.009
cause they are gonna be redone
so you could just drag them.

54:22.069 --> 54:23.559
They look so heavy.

54:24.149 --> 54:26.219
Don't make me into a
mommy dearest, okay?

54:26.219 --> 54:28.969
You're strong, you can do it.
You're already wearing gloves, just...

54:29.259 --> 54:30.789
Just put you're weight into it.

54:33.089 --> 54:35.199
No, swivel it.
Like this look here.

54:35.199 --> 54:35.889
Swivel.

54:37.889 --> 54:39.349
<i>Hello?!</i>

54:41.369 --> 54:42.939
The door was open!

54:51.359 --> 54:52.819
What's happening?

54:52.889 --> 54:54.799
This hasn't hit the news yet.

54:55.389 --> 54:56.539
What?

54:57.089 --> 54:59.289
Azita Wachtel's little boy...

54:59.409 --> 55:00.439
...died.

55:01.439 --> 55:03.889
No!
I just saw them!

55:03.889 --> 55:06.319
Um... he was with his dad, in Ohi.

55:06.319 --> 55:07.669
- And he drowned.
- My God!

55:07.669 --> 55:08.849
Micah! How?!

55:08.889 --> 55:11.089
In the pool...
- And she wasn't there?

55:11.169 --> 55:13.289
I don't know, I mean, nobody knows yet.

55:13.319 --> 55:14.389
Anything.

55:15.289 --> 55:16.789
But here's what's going on.

55:16.849 --> 55:18.449
And I know it's schoolish...

55:18.759 --> 55:21.479
But I think we can get you to replace...

55:21.769 --> 55:22.769
But how?

55:22.809 --> 55:24.293
Well Azita is in the hospital.
You know.

55:24.293 --> 55:26.289
She totally lost it.
They had to sedate her.

55:26.649 --> 55:29.039
Um... won't they just shoot
around her for a few weeks?

55:29.079 --> 55:30.749
There's no way she's going back to work.

55:30.749 --> 55:30.759
How much have they shoot?
There's no way she's going back to work.

55:30.759 --> 55:32.059
How much have they shoot?

55:32.129 --> 55:33.629
Eh, just a few days.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.449
Casting people called me.

55:35.449 --> 55:36.529
3 times.

55:36.529 --> 55:38.189
Sarah Horowitz? She call back?

55:38.359 --> 55:40.399
Yeah... they want to make an offer.

55:41.879 --> 55:43.739
Did Damien call?

55:44.029 --> 55:46.049
No, but you know,
he's probably consumed.

55:46.159 --> 55:47.509
Well, but, Havana...

55:47.539 --> 55:50.979
They are not gonna make an offer
without Damien's complete approval.

55:50.979 --> 55:53.009
No. Ah... Azita should just... do it.

55:53.009 --> 55:54.249
She should... she should work.

55:54.249 --> 55:56.609
She should go to the funeral and
then go right back to work.

55:56.609 --> 55:59.879
Yeah I know, it's beyond but
do you still want to do it?

56:00.809 --> 56:02.449
I need to talk to Damien.

56:02.499 --> 56:03.579
You will!

56:03.579 --> 56:04.909
But this just happened.

56:05.029 --> 56:07.029
I haven't been able to reach anyone.

56:08.249 --> 56:11.779
Don't go deafen my quote,
cause if they're really in trouble, we're in the capital seat.

56:12.129 --> 56:14.389
Unless they're out to somebody else.

56:14.549 --> 56:16.479
I'll call you as soon as I hear.

56:18.649 --> 56:20.519
Should I send flowers?!

56:21.139 --> 56:23.289
You're not supposed to know!

56:23.389 --> 56:26.829
And save the flowers to Damien,
when we close!

56:27.179 --> 56:28.089
Ciao!

56:34.989 --> 56:37.109
Na-na-naa-na!

56:37.109 --> 56:38.929
Na-na-na-naa!

56:38.989 --> 56:40.969
Hey-hey-hey!

56:40.969 --> 56:42.769
Goodbye! Come on sing it!

56:42.769 --> 56:44.659
Na-na-naa-na!

56:44.659 --> 56:46.659
Na-na-na-naa!

56:46.659 --> 56:48.479
Hey-hey-hey!

56:48.549 --> 56:51.049
Goodbye! This is for little Micah!

56:51.049 --> 56:53.499
- Little miracles!
- Who's Micah?

56:53.669 --> 56:54.989
Fire and water!

56:54.989 --> 56:57.509
We're fire and he's water!

56:57.509 --> 56:59.509
- So say goodbye!
- Bye!

56:59.509 --> 57:02.839
Na-naa-na-goodbye Micah!
Na-na-na-naa!

57:02.879 --> 57:05.109
- Fire and water, say it!
- Fire and water!

57:05.149 --> 57:09.629
Hey-hey-hey, goodbye, woohaa!

57:18.319 --> 57:19.869
Excuse me?

57:20.079 --> 57:23.149
I'm looking for Jerome Fontana.
He had a callback?

57:23.229 --> 57:24.369
He's a Vorbalit?

57:26.489 --> 57:27.569
Try make-up.

57:33.509 --> 57:34.319
Hey!

57:39.669 --> 57:40.919
What are you doing here?

57:41.749 --> 57:45.529
Havana is having lunch at the commissary.
Thought I'd see if I can find you.

57:47.269 --> 57:49.189
Is it supposed to be a burn?

57:50.089 --> 57:51.869
No, I don't think so. I think uh...

57:52.159 --> 57:53.909
...it's a birthmark or something.

57:57.549 --> 57:58.769
We're half an hour away.

57:58.769 --> 58:01.109
Go back to make-up and
get some color on that thing.

58:09.809 --> 58:12.929
They did have a cover... for the pool but...

58:13.259 --> 58:15.739
The motor was in the shop for repair.

58:17.749 --> 58:19.279
He didn't swim?

58:20.059 --> 58:22.179
The father heard the phone...

58:22.719 --> 58:25.029
And he thought it was Azita
so he went inside for like

58:25.549 --> 58:28.969
That's always how it happens,
I mean, uff, thats...

58:29.139 --> 58:31.389
Always how you hear it happens.

58:31.869 --> 58:33.689
Mm.

58:35.529 --> 58:37.289
Have you talked to Azita?

58:37.359 --> 58:39.549
Uh, yeah, I went to see her.
She's home now.

58:40.909 --> 58:43.109
I told her you were playing her part.

58:43.419 --> 58:45.229
She was relieved.

58:45.329 --> 58:47.059
At least she seemed to be.

58:48.089 --> 58:50.149
I felt weird.

58:51.109 --> 58:52.569
Going in there to tell her...

58:52.729 --> 58:54.829
...that. But we had become close.

58:57.859 --> 58:59.429
Anyway, listen, I... I was...

58:59.489 --> 59:00.849
I was going to call you.

59:01.069 --> 59:03.209
To tell you about my decision to go...

59:03.929 --> 59:06.109
...with Azita but things went crazy.

59:06.969 --> 59:10.449
Yeah, it's cool Damien.
I'm... I'm totally fine.

59:10.509 --> 59:11.839
Yeah... I'm not.

59:12.609 --> 59:13.729
I don't like the way...

59:13.779 --> 59:14.929
...that that was handled.

59:15.199 --> 59:16.739
I loved your read.

59:17.059 --> 59:18.089
You know that.

59:19.149 --> 59:21.119
I had some initial misgivings about...

59:21.179 --> 59:22.719
...the connection to your mother.

59:23.959 --> 59:25.029
But...

59:25.429 --> 59:27.369
...the film, that I'm making...

59:27.539 --> 59:29.709
...is very different from the original.

59:29.729 --> 59:32.369
In fact, in some ways
it does not resemble it at all.

59:32.409 --> 59:36.099
Which I would probably be
taking it to task for it.

59:36.289 --> 59:38.949
The script is amazing.

59:39.869 --> 59:41.169
Thank you.

59:42.429 --> 59:44.109
You know, I just want you to feel strong.

59:44.969 --> 59:46.509
Coming in like this.

59:47.809 --> 59:49.889
Things happen for a reason.

59:50.369 --> 59:52.159
I'm a big believer in that.

59:54.209 --> 59:56.089
So glad to have you on this show.

01:00:11.559 --> 01:00:12.529
Benjie?

01:00:12.629 --> 01:00:15.789
Hey, Victoria Lap in Star! Channel,
are you ready for us now?

01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:18.889
- No.
- Uh, we had a 4 o'clock interview with you.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.069
- No.
- Didn't Genie tell you?

01:00:21.149 --> 01:00:24.639
- No.
- Uh, uh, well can we just have 15 minutes?

01:00:24.709 --> 01:00:25.389
No.

01:00:26.059 --> 01:00:28.299
Okay, we've been waiting here for you.

01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:32.109
Why don't you talk
to my co-star Jim Carrey Jr?

01:00:32.649 --> 01:00:33.859
There he is.

01:00:33.859 --> 01:00:37.039
Hey! Mr. Piece of Shit Va-bina!
Wanna be on TV?

01:00:38.079 --> 01:00:38.949
Sure.

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:41.279
Get your jailbait ass over here.

01:00:47.629 --> 01:00:49.599
Hi, I'm Roy.

01:01:14.929 --> 01:01:16.399
Hey Benjie.

01:01:17.599 --> 01:01:19.489
FUCK!
You! Get out!

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:22.239
Hey, it's okay.
I'm here to make amends.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:23.799
How did you get on the lot?

01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:25.869
I work for somebody
who's doing a film here.

01:01:25.939 --> 01:01:27.169
Havana Segrand.

01:01:28.609 --> 01:01:30.629
You're gonna hurt me, Agatha?

01:01:30.859 --> 01:01:32.109
No...

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:34.229
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:36.609
You're my little brother.

01:01:36.699 --> 01:01:38.819
You try to hurt me and
I'll fucking kill you!

01:01:38.899 --> 01:01:41.039
- Understood?
- Um-hm.

01:01:45.659 --> 01:01:46.979
You hungry?

01:01:47.129 --> 01:01:48.489
Want a breakfast burrito?

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:50.389
No, I can't stay long.

01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:54.609
Havana Segrand, huh?

01:01:55.689 --> 01:01:58.549
- Was that bullshit or are you serious?
- Um-hm.

01:02:02.009 --> 01:02:03.399
She's really good.

01:02:04.009 --> 01:02:05.679
We have the same agent.

01:02:06.909 --> 01:02:09.659
How that happen,
you working for Havana Segrand?

01:02:09.699 --> 01:02:11.909
Oh... it's... through friends.

01:02:12.059 --> 01:02:13.469
Carrie Fisher.

01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:18.419
You know for a... a disfigured schizophrenic
you got the town pretty wired.

01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:23.509
They now you are here, Agatha.

01:02:24.759 --> 01:02:25.829
How?

01:02:26.229 --> 01:02:29.359
Dad! He's all fucking seeing and knowing
if you don't remember.

01:02:29.709 --> 01:02:31.449
Watch your step cause...

01:02:31.649 --> 01:02:35.549
...the old man is getting a restraining order
against you or some such shit.

01:02:35.989 --> 01:02:38.949
I prefer if you didn't tell them I stopped by.

01:02:43.479 --> 01:02:45.849
I'm not a big fan of closures so...

01:02:45.879 --> 01:02:49.689
If you're looking for an epiphany
that's gonna help you go on with your life than...

01:02:49.689 --> 01:02:50.919
I wrote to you...

01:02:51.329 --> 01:02:52.779
...for years.

01:02:54.919 --> 01:02:56.329
To explain.

01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:04.709
Benjie, it's Jeb Berg.

01:03:07.499 --> 01:03:08.779
I'm taking a nap Jeb.

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:10.999
There he is, hey, that's alright, listen...

01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:13.399
I've got my nieces here from
Connecticut and they...

01:03:13.399 --> 01:03:14.769
Universal Studios.

01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:16.609
Put there asses on the tram Jeb Berg.

01:03:21.499 --> 01:03:23.399
You're so mean.

01:03:23.449 --> 01:03:25.609
I fuck them when I can.
Do you want a Cobalt?

01:03:26.339 --> 01:03:28.269
Nah, sugar makes me crazy.

01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:31.949
Very funny.

01:03:34.529 --> 01:03:36.129
So, uh, mom and dad...

01:03:36.129 --> 01:03:38.129
...sent you to the snake pit?

01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:39.649
The courts did.

01:03:41.749 --> 01:03:43.059
Looking pretty good.

01:03:43.909 --> 01:03:46.159
I was in Sherman Oaks. On the burn ward.

01:03:46.259 --> 01:03:48.259
After my grapht they sent me to Florida.

01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:49.669
The Land of Scarface.

01:03:49.699 --> 01:03:51.289
Tony Montana, I love it.

01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:58.249
Did you put that in?

01:03:58.699 --> 01:03:59.659
Um-hm.

01:04:00.019 --> 01:04:01.589
That's Havana's mom.

01:04:04.629 --> 01:04:06.419
Did you start the fire?

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:11.409
This is hard.

01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:13.749
No shit. Did you?

01:04:16.709 --> 01:04:19.029
But I didn't want anything to happen to you.

01:04:19.649 --> 01:04:21.249
Do you know about them?

01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:23.329
About who we are.
Did they tell you?

01:04:23.519 --> 01:04:24.809
Pills?

01:04:25.129 --> 01:04:28.219
- Vitamins?
- Probably something for sleep.

01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:33.059
So you gave me pills and then
you set the house on fire?

01:04:33.649 --> 01:04:36.669
Why am I having trouble with the
'I didn't want anything to happen with you' part?

01:04:36.669 --> 01:04:39.139
- I was seeing things!
- Like what?

01:04:39.239 --> 01:04:40.249
Children.

01:04:43.979 --> 01:04:45.959
What'd you do when you uh...

01:04:46.039 --> 01:04:47.009
...when you saw them?

01:04:49.039 --> 01:04:50.389
I would say...

01:04:50.689 --> 01:04:53.489
...by this ring,
you are consecrated to me.

01:04:54.409 --> 01:04:57.679
I remember that's... that's...
that was the game we played.

01:04:57.809 --> 01:04:59.269
It always worked.

01:04:59.749 --> 01:05:02.009
As soon as I said it,
they always went away.

01:05:05.789 --> 01:05:08.609
Okay, uh, I think you have to go now.

01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:12.949
Benjie...

01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:15.159
There's this script.

01:05:15.929 --> 01:05:19.779
I can't explain but you are part of this
beautiful mythological script.

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:21.489
Oh my God.

01:05:21.639 --> 01:05:26.049
My long lost psychotron sister
is pitching me a movie.

01:05:29.689 --> 01:05:31.629
Agatha, leave.

01:05:31.949 --> 01:05:33.929
And take the DVD with you.

01:05:36.249 --> 01:05:39.569
You don't have to worry
about me starting anymore fires.

01:05:41.649 --> 01:05:43.909
They blew my pile lighter right out.

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:49.069
Work your program Milton.

01:05:49.729 --> 01:05:51.619
Don't argue in the bedroom. Bedroom...

01:05:51.619 --> 01:05:53.299
...is for sleeping, making love, not for fighting.

01:05:53.299 --> 01:05:55.299
You need to talk, go to a coffee shop.

01:05:55.979 --> 01:05:57.029
Thank you.

01:05:58.349 --> 01:06:00.199
- Thanks.
- See you Tuesday.

01:06:00.199 --> 01:06:02.199
Okay. Thanks.

01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:10.049
Yeah?

01:06:13.209 --> 01:06:14.839
Was she there now?

01:06:33.659 --> 01:06:34.889
Hello, Agatha.

01:06:37.489 --> 01:06:38.979
My books!

01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:40.709
You're reading any of them?

01:06:41.129 --> 01:06:42.249
Yes.

01:06:43.169 --> 01:06:44.979
Secrets kill.

01:06:45.879 --> 01:06:47.449
A classic.

01:06:48.089 --> 01:06:49.579
How did you find me?

01:06:49.679 --> 01:06:51.559
Please, no film noir questions.

01:06:51.559 --> 01:06:53.989
- Did Benjie...
- Did Benjie tell me you're here?

01:06:54.169 --> 01:06:56.439
How would he now that?
Did you go see Benjie?

01:06:56.709 --> 01:06:59.239
- No...
- Bad idea. Going to see Benjie.

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.269
Reckless.

01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:04.809
A question remains.

01:07:06.139 --> 01:07:07.529
Why are you in LA?

01:07:09.719 --> 01:07:11.449
I'm in recovery.

01:07:12.359 --> 01:07:14.269
I wanted to make amends.

01:07:14.949 --> 01:07:17.859
No one escapes
the long arm of 12-step.

01:07:22.809 --> 01:07:24.789
Why didn't you ever come and see me?

01:07:25.009 --> 01:07:26.879
That's a victim question.

01:07:27.319 --> 01:07:31.099
That's, and I never promised you
a Rose card question.

01:07:31.769 --> 01:07:33.129
<i>You know why.</i>

01:07:33.409 --> 01:07:36.539
I don't believe in rewarding.
Homicidal behavior.

01:07:36.609 --> 01:07:38.259
I've changed.

01:07:39.319 --> 01:07:43.449
I wanted to tell you how...
how sorry I am for what I did.

01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:46.739
I wanted to tell you and mother.
I sent letters.

01:07:46.889 --> 01:07:48.519
Apology's accepted.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.829
You need money?

01:07:52.559 --> 01:07:54.069
No, I have a job.

01:07:54.329 --> 01:07:56.309
I'm working for Havana Segrand.

01:07:56.369 --> 01:07:57.899
She asked if I knew you.

01:07:58.099 --> 01:07:59.349
Here.

01:07:59.599 --> 01:08:03.079
Here's 10000 dollars.
I want you to get on a plane, that would be true amends.

01:08:03.369 --> 01:08:07.499
Our lives are rich and full.
We made them from the ashes of what you left.

01:08:08.489 --> 01:08:10.259
Give Ms. Segrand a notice.

01:08:11.999 --> 01:08:13.259
Father...

01:08:15.199 --> 01:08:16.019
Please.

01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:21.389
Don't ever think about seeing
Benjie again or Christina, do you understand?

01:08:21.959 --> 01:08:26.639
You can't have actually believed I would let you
come back and fuck up my world again?

01:08:27.299 --> 01:08:28.969
Take your skin cream...

01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:33.238
...and your meds and your
hefty bag luggage and send them out the door.

01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:40.469
And work your program.

01:08:50.139 --> 01:08:51.448
Alright.

01:08:51.788 --> 01:08:53.759
We're done Benjie.
I'll see you Friday.

01:08:54.259 --> 01:08:56.189
Alright, thanks Rusty.

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:12.469
Hey!

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:14.729
What are you doing in there?

01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:20.719
What the fuck are you doing in my pool?

01:09:20.839 --> 01:09:21.779
Who are you?

01:09:21.929 --> 01:09:23.499
Micah!

01:09:25.719 --> 01:09:27.549
It's a drowned boy.

01:09:28.649 --> 01:09:30.738
I don't want to see you.

01:09:31.169 --> 01:09:33.538
I didn't do anything to you.

01:09:34.929 --> 01:09:37.658
His father thinks you could
have done something to save him.

01:09:38.509 --> 01:09:40.229
That's what father's always think.

01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:42.038
I'm not doing this.

01:09:43.259 --> 01:09:45.559
Go play with somebody else.

01:09:46.429 --> 01:09:51.209
I'm alive, asshole! I'm alive!
And I'm not crazy!

01:10:04.919 --> 01:10:06.209
I know a man...

01:10:06.289 --> 01:10:08.909
...who lives under the sword of Damocles.

01:10:08.979 --> 01:10:10.409
We call aids.

01:10:11.329 --> 01:10:13.399
'When my time comes' he told me.

01:10:13.849 --> 01:10:15.359
I'll be ready.

01:10:15.629 --> 01:10:18.669
My bags are packed and at the door.

01:10:19.489 --> 01:10:21.899
I like that. I like that very m...

01:11:41.799 --> 01:11:43.019
Liberty.

01:11:48.219 --> 01:11:50.749
Say... we have to stop.

01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:53.279
We have to stop.

01:11:53.929 --> 01:11:55.849
You're a patient here.
I want to help you.

01:11:58.289 --> 01:12:00.299
You're a patient here.
I want to help you.

01:12:00.769 --> 01:12:02.969
You don't think I set those fires do you?

01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:06.579
Say, 'I think that you didn't mean to.
You just need help, that's all'.

01:12:07.599 --> 01:12:10.129
Think you didn't mean to.
You just need help, that's all.

01:12:12.179 --> 01:12:13.659
Don't you want to help me?

01:12:18.129 --> 01:12:19.909
Will you leave my stockings?

01:12:19.999 --> 01:12:21.469
I have burns.

01:12:21.689 --> 01:12:23.599
My legs. My stomach. My back.

01:12:27.269 --> 01:12:27.989
Okay.

01:12:35.429 --> 01:12:37.149
On my school notebook.

01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:39.139
On my desk and on the trees.

01:12:39.349 --> 01:12:41.869
In the sand and in the snow,
I write your name.

01:12:42.319 --> 01:12:44.349
On all the flesh that says yes.

01:12:44.549 --> 01:12:45.899
On the forehead of my friends.

01:12:45.899 --> 01:12:48.269
On every hand held out,
I write your name.

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:23.919
<i>Your mother of course</i>
was Clarice Taggart.

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:27.709
<i>The wonderful actress who died</i>
tragically in a fire in the mid 70's.

01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:29.709
<i>Christmas '76.</i>

01:13:29.949 --> 01:13:32.249
<i>You've spoken of your mother's addictions.</i>

01:13:32.249 --> 01:13:35.989
<i>And recently revealed and,</i>
very bravely, I might say,

01:13:35.989 --> 01:13:38.849
<i>that you yourself</i>
were physically abused.

01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:40.299
<i>And sexually, yes.</i>

01:13:40.359 --> 01:13:44.119
<i>Which is far more uncommon, usually it's a male,</i>
the father, stepdad, what have you.

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:46.849
<i>And I wanna talk</i>
about that Havana, but first...

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:50.379
<i>There is a question that</i>
I've been dieing to ask.

01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:52.409
<i>What is it like</i>

01:13:52.409 --> 01:13:56.229
<i>starring in a remake of a movie,</i>
'Stolen Waters', as you are now

01:13:56.779 --> 01:13:58.069
<i>and essentially</i>

01:13:58.069 --> 01:13:59.549
<i>playing your mother?</i>

01:14:00.349 --> 01:14:01.759
<i>Scary.</i>

01:14:01.759 --> 01:14:05.139
<i>I mean, we all hear that</i>
we become our mothers but

01:14:05.139 --> 01:14:07.029
<i>this is a bit extreme.</i>

01:14:07.089 --> 01:14:09.169
<i>And she was even nominated?</i>

01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:11.589
<i>For an academy award, yes,</i>
which I believe she should have won.

01:14:11.589 --> 01:14:13.499
<i>But she did get the Golden Globe.</i>

01:14:13.559 --> 01:14:17.989
<i>I suppose I feel about as</i>
comfortable as I, as I could.

01:14:18.069 --> 01:14:21.179
<i>- We're very lucky to have Damien Javitz directing...</i>
- Agatha!

01:14:21.409 --> 01:14:23.479
<i>- There is a man who's made some...</i>
- Agatha, could you come up here?!

01:14:23.479 --> 01:14:27.269
<i>Strange films. Honored?</i>
Yes, but strange nonetheless.

01:14:30.979 --> 01:14:32.629
Don't be shy.

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:34.769
I'm so backed up from the Vicodin.

01:14:35.009 --> 01:14:37.369
I need you to go back to
Whole Foods and get me a laxative.

01:14:37.369 --> 01:14:37.379
I think it's called 'Quiet Moment'.
I need you to go back to
Whole Foods and get me a laxative.

01:14:37.379 --> 01:14:39.049
I think it's called 'Quiet Moment'.

01:14:39.729 --> 01:14:40.509
Oh...

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.959
I should call it 'Un-Quiet Moment'.

01:14:43.449 --> 01:14:45.309
Um, and I'm gonna need you tonight.

01:14:45.339 --> 01:14:49.339
Maria can't work. One of her 1000 kids
has got cholera or whatever.

01:14:49.779 --> 01:14:51.859
Oh, uh... what do... what do I do?

01:14:51.949 --> 01:14:54.589
Um, kitchen stuff. Mostly.

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:58.109
You know, easy.
Refill drinks, maybe little serving.

01:14:58.219 --> 01:15:00.429
And have fun. Lots of interesting people.

01:15:00.699 --> 01:15:02.709
It'll be good for you.

01:15:04.039 --> 01:15:05.169
Fuck!

01:15:05.299 --> 01:15:07.269
I think I'm gonna need an enema.

01:15:07.459 --> 01:15:08.979
Oh! Wait, wait.

01:15:09.369 --> 01:15:11.009
I wanted to ask you something.

01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:14.209
Do you see men?

01:15:14.569 --> 01:15:15.969
Sometimes.

01:15:16.819 --> 01:15:18.879
Are you seeing someone now?

01:15:22.529 --> 01:15:24.389
You are!

01:15:24.409 --> 01:15:26.269
Just dating a little.

01:15:26.699 --> 01:15:28.009
What does he do?

01:15:28.129 --> 01:15:29.349
He's an actor.

01:15:29.449 --> 01:15:33.239
Oh God! They're the worst!
You have to fight them for the mirror in the mornings.

01:15:33.289 --> 01:15:35.399
Well in my case, that doesn't apply.

01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:37.119
He writes too.

01:15:38.169 --> 01:15:42.329
No. You know, you're very attractive.
Don't run yourself down.

01:15:42.969 --> 01:15:44.329
Do you do it with him?

01:15:44.619 --> 01:15:45.619
Havana!

01:15:45.619 --> 01:15:47.879
Eh, you can tell me!

01:15:48.749 --> 01:15:50.249
How much do you do?

01:15:50.509 --> 01:15:52.249
Almost everything.

01:15:52.299 --> 01:15:53.319
Do you come?

01:15:55.029 --> 01:15:56.209
There you go.

01:15:56.739 --> 01:15:57.929
Is he a waiter?

01:15:58.089 --> 01:16:02.249
No. He... you... uh, he drives a limousine.
You met him outside of Valentino's.

01:16:02.309 --> 01:16:03.829
Oh, yeah!

01:16:03.889 --> 01:16:05.219
He's cute.

01:16:05.999 --> 01:16:08.389
Man! Limo-drivers are Rolls!

01:16:08.559 --> 01:16:09.709
Um, okay.

01:16:10.359 --> 01:16:12.159
Um, I need

01:16:12.159 --> 01:16:15.589
yogurt and cigarettes and call the
hot tub man because the water's cold.

01:16:16.179 --> 01:16:18.999
My God. Oh my God! It stinks in here!

01:16:28.349 --> 01:16:29.769
Hey sucker fish!

01:16:29.769 --> 01:16:31.839
Hey! You're out late for a school night.

01:16:31.839 --> 01:16:33.519
2 days off.

01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:35.029
Have a Shirley Temple.

01:16:35.069 --> 01:16:36.509
Shirley you jest.

01:16:36.789 --> 01:16:38.399
Don't call me Shirley.

01:16:38.989 --> 01:16:41.189
Oh, um Benjie Weiss. Gretchen Voss.

01:16:43.089 --> 01:16:44.009
Hey, ah...

01:16:44.009 --> 01:16:46.399
I feel like getting in some shit tonight.
You got any?

01:16:46.399 --> 01:16:47.479
Mother still working you?

01:16:47.489 --> 01:16:49.679
Busting my expensive little hump,
one day at a time.

01:16:52.449 --> 01:16:53.989
Where's... ah... Kayla?

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.819
Naw, fuck her.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:59.589
I did! After the teem-stress
sold her my poop.

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.529
She got it for her song.

01:17:01.529 --> 01:17:03.829
Well, you mean for a Shlong.

01:17:04.249 --> 01:17:05.309
Oh, it's a long story.

01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:07.009
Long and coiled.

01:17:07.949 --> 01:17:09.569
What up with Sam?

01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:11.619
Well, let's find out.

01:17:12.249 --> 01:17:13.559
Shall we?

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:16.129
She dug you, man.

01:17:16.129 --> 01:17:17.859
She dug you and you dissed her.

01:17:17.859 --> 01:17:19.439
I didn't dis her.

01:17:21.239 --> 01:17:23.079
Red, I know you're holding in.

01:17:23.079 --> 01:17:25.509
I'm not gonna be the one
to fuck up your sobriety, okay Benjie?

01:17:27.689 --> 01:17:30.699
Are you doing the
new babysitter sequel?

01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:32.169
Yeah.

01:17:32.259 --> 01:17:35.259
They made me an offer
my mother couldn't refuse.

01:17:35.469 --> 01:17:37.009
You made so much money.

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:37.899
Yeah.

01:17:38.179 --> 01:17:40.489
Saw you in 'Thrill Kill'. Cool.

01:17:40.579 --> 01:17:43.279
We tried to have fun with horror.
The critics got it anyways.

01:17:44.099 --> 01:17:45.249
I uh...

01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:47.749
Got a little GHB, if you wanna get high?

01:17:48.049 --> 01:17:49.409
I think I love you.

01:17:50.759 --> 01:17:52.909
Alright, Sam's on a way, Jose.

01:17:52.929 --> 01:17:54.189
Done deal.

01:17:55.449 --> 01:17:57.059
The terminator.

01:17:58.409 --> 01:17:59.549
Cheers.

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:01.759
Cheers.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:11.389
So, I got this off of eBay.
And supposedly, they used it at Columbine. Check it out.

01:18:16.069 --> 01:18:18.719
Hey! Hey! It's loaded man!
That's loaded.

01:18:18.719 --> 01:18:19.719
Then I'll empty it.

01:18:19.719 --> 01:18:21.929
Okay, don't fuck around.

01:18:23.459 --> 01:18:24.919
Benjie!

01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:27.859
That was so sick.

01:18:27.859 --> 01:18:29.859
Oh God. America only knew.

01:18:30.769 --> 01:18:32.219
Finish the joke, Rhett.

01:18:32.219 --> 01:18:33.319
About the hillbilly.

01:18:33.319 --> 01:18:35.319
Oh my God!
You've only been telling it for an hour.

01:18:35.359 --> 01:18:39.299
Okay, so, okay,
the hillbilly says to the yuppie...

01:18:39.299 --> 01:18:41.179
And what exactly is a yuppie?

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:42.219
Are you serious?

01:18:42.219 --> 01:18:44.329
Oh, like, I know what it is.

01:18:44.329 --> 01:18:46.739
- I just don't know what it stands for.
- Okay.

01:18:46.739 --> 01:18:48.319
The hillbilly says to the yuppie, right?

01:18:48.319 --> 01:18:50.319
He says, 'I know a place where we can go'.

01:18:50.349 --> 01:18:51.049
Right?

01:18:51.209 --> 01:18:53.449
Well, they got dancing, they got farting

01:18:53.449 --> 01:18:56.189
they got drinking and
they got FUCKING, WOO!

01:18:56.549 --> 01:18:58.509
This is joking and safe sex?

01:18:58.569 --> 01:19:00.879
Fuck safe sex! Let's bareback!

01:19:00.899 --> 01:19:02.349
Alright, come on, give me that.

01:19:02.349 --> 01:19:04.649
Eh, I said... this is a joke.

01:19:04.649 --> 01:19:05.799
And it's safe sex.

01:19:05.809 --> 01:19:08.379
Oh, well... I hope not.

01:19:08.829 --> 01:19:10.549
I'm gonna have to kill you.

01:19:11.449 --> 01:19:12.501
Come on. Benjie!

01:19:12.509 --> 01:19:14.499
- This is getting old, alright?
- Yuppie says...

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:17.209
...great!
Who else is gonna be there?

01:19:17.479 --> 01:19:18.869
And the hillbilly says...

01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:20.279
Who else?

01:19:20.519 --> 01:19:21.669
Just me...

01:19:21.849 --> 01:19:23.069
...and you.

01:19:31.519 --> 01:19:34.569
You mother fucker!
You idiot!

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:35.569
Oh God!

01:19:35.569 --> 01:19:36.319
Holy shit!

01:19:36.319 --> 01:19:38.319
Oh fuck! FUCK!

01:19:38.429 --> 01:19:41.729
- Get out of here Benjie!
- Rhett, man, I'm sorry! You saw... I...

01:19:41.939 --> 01:19:43.709
I had all the bullets out.

01:19:47.169 --> 01:19:49.849
You're fucking crazy.
You killed my dog, asshole!

01:19:49.899 --> 01:19:53.579
You sick mother fucker! You killed my dog!
GET OUT OF HERE!

01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:02.109
May I come in?

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:06.439
- I'm not sure that's a good idea.
- I won't stay long, mom.

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.639
I just wanted to make amends.

01:20:18.019 --> 01:20:21.219
I've seen this house in the magazines.

01:20:22.489 --> 01:20:23.689
In ah...

01:20:23.749 --> 01:20:27.199
Architectural Digest and The Profiles of Father.

01:20:30.489 --> 01:20:32.689
Makes me feel exposed but...

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.619
Stafford likes things personalized.

01:20:39.059 --> 01:20:41.989
Show the world how and where we live.

01:20:49.619 --> 01:20:51.129
Can I...

01:20:51.209 --> 01:20:52.569
...get you anything?

01:20:53.259 --> 01:20:54.589
Um, no thank you.

01:21:03.729 --> 01:21:05.929
I suppose it'll quit.

01:21:07.239 --> 01:21:10.669
Actually I thought
you'd come here sooner, it...

01:21:11.089 --> 01:21:12.589
It's been 7 years.

01:21:14.459 --> 01:21:17.089
Takes me that long to
put on my make-up.

01:21:21.589 --> 01:21:23.529
Agatha, I... I didn't go to see you.

01:21:23.529 --> 01:21:25.529
I wouldn't have come to
see me if I were you either.

01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:29.759
I was afraid.

01:21:31.779 --> 01:21:33.159
Cause of what you did.

01:21:33.499 --> 01:21:35.039
You don't have to explain.

01:21:35.479 --> 01:21:38.069
I've dreamt so much of that old house.

01:21:38.929 --> 01:21:41.599
It was the first place I visited
when I got back here.

01:21:41.899 --> 01:21:44.369
It's so strange that nobody has built on it.

01:21:44.609 --> 01:21:46.009
Well we still own the property.

01:21:46.399 --> 01:21:49.669
Since before I can remember,
I've had the same dream.

01:21:50.249 --> 01:21:52.499
Benjie and me, getting married there.

01:21:52.759 --> 01:21:54.929
In a big white tent.
I didn't make any sense.

01:21:54.929 --> 01:21:57.209
And then I found out
about you and dad.

01:21:57.459 --> 01:21:59.239
You were in Europe, I...

01:21:59.539 --> 01:22:02.709
...found a key to the lock box,
all the pictures.

01:22:04.339 --> 01:22:06.319
We didn't know we were
brother and sister.

01:22:08.999 --> 01:22:11.519
We've been separated
since we were kids.

01:22:14.369 --> 01:22:15.799
It was a freak thing, we...

01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:19.359
...met on campus, in the desert...

01:22:21.759 --> 01:22:23.409
Agatha, we didn't know.

01:22:25.769 --> 01:22:28.029
We didn't know.

01:22:37.849 --> 01:22:39.269
What are you doing here?

01:22:39.359 --> 01:22:40.739
Stafford, it's alright.

01:22:42.949 --> 01:22:45.089
I told you to stay away from us.

01:22:46.609 --> 01:22:48.029
You didn't know.

01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:50.809
It was a freak thing.

01:22:51.829 --> 01:22:53.789
I found the diaries.

01:22:54.359 --> 01:22:56.289
Love is stronger than death.

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:05.239
- You crazy cunt!
- Stafford!

01:23:05.249 --> 01:23:06.529
- Daddy no!

01:23:09.659 --> 01:23:11.099
Get off her!

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:21.149
Okay.

01:23:21.289 --> 01:23:22.079
Okay.

01:23:22.079 --> 01:23:24.049
- Gotto go! Gotto go!
- Don't take her!

01:23:24.049 --> 01:23:26.079
- Gotto go!
- Don't take her!

01:23:26.079 --> 01:23:30.419
- Don't take her!
- Let me go!

01:23:55.009 --> 01:23:56.259
My ring.

01:23:57.639 --> 01:23:59.589
She took my wedding ring.

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:02.659
My ring.

01:24:27.129 --> 01:24:28.849
Piss patrol!

01:24:28.869 --> 01:24:30.079
Caught in the act.

01:24:31.089 --> 01:24:32.109
You know...

01:24:32.749 --> 01:24:35.239
You're chewing some major
scenery out there.

01:24:35.479 --> 01:24:38.039
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

01:24:39.119 --> 01:24:40.909
Va-bina head!

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:43.549
Who's the star of the show?

01:24:44.449 --> 01:24:45.439
Huh?!

01:24:45.659 --> 01:24:47.309
Can you tell me that, Roy?

01:24:47.659 --> 01:24:49.409
Uh... you are?

01:24:50.979 --> 01:24:53.149
He's not your enemy.

01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:55.299
You!

01:24:57.319 --> 01:24:59.949
Love is stronger than death.

01:25:06.289 --> 01:25:08.429
You're... a bad babysitter, Benjamin!

01:25:08.509 --> 01:25:09.819
You die!

01:25:09.929 --> 01:25:10.979
DIE!

01:25:11.089 --> 01:25:13.039
You're a bad babysitter!

01:25:41.519 --> 01:25:42.719
Fuck.

01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:45.609
Fuck!

01:25:47.659 --> 01:25:48.679
Fuck!

01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:55.729
He maybe groggy
from the medication.

01:25:59.049 --> 01:25:59.689
Oh.

01:25:59.839 --> 01:26:04.759
Oh my baby! My baby!
My baby! My baby...

01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:12.999
I'm so sorry, mom.

01:26:12.999 --> 01:26:14.069
Why?

01:26:14.929 --> 01:26:17.039
Benjie, why did you do it?

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:19.119
He was just a little boy...

01:26:22.089 --> 01:26:23.899
I saw her and...

01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:27.049
Who, baby? Agatha?

01:26:27.759 --> 01:26:29.489
Did Agatha come to see you?

01:26:29.789 --> 01:26:31.899
Little girl.
She tricked me.

01:26:32.809 --> 01:26:34.149
What little girl?

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:37.969
From the hospital.
The one that died.

01:26:38.089 --> 01:26:39.769
I keep seeing.

01:26:40.639 --> 01:26:44.219
Oh, my baby!
My baby! My baby!

01:26:45.789 --> 01:26:49.819
Oh my baby! Oh my baby!
Oh my baby! Oh my baby.

01:26:49.819 --> 01:26:51.409
We've got to get him home.

01:26:51.609 --> 01:26:54.279
I'd like to place him
outside of California.

01:26:54.519 --> 01:26:57.469
We need Jonas to speak
with the district attorney.

01:26:57.689 --> 01:26:59.409
He's only 13.

01:27:01.439 --> 01:27:05.409
We have to factor in
the violence of the assault, Christina.

01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:09.619
He didn't take a gun to a kid at school, Harriet!
He hurt one boy. One boy!

01:27:09.619 --> 01:27:12.569
The state's become
very tough on minors.

01:27:13.689 --> 01:27:15.329
They won't send him to jail?

01:27:17.199 --> 01:27:19.069
They won't send him to jail.

01:27:24.329 --> 01:27:25.829
Boy's gonna be alright.

01:27:25.829 --> 01:27:27.829
Oh, thank God!

01:27:28.479 --> 01:27:30.129
They've shut down production.

01:27:31.429 --> 01:27:33.139
I don't know if
they are gonna recast.

01:27:35.259 --> 01:27:38.119
But it's such a small little part, what?

01:27:38.159 --> 01:27:40.769
BENJIE!
They are talking about recasting BENJIE!

01:27:40.769 --> 01:27:42.419
- My god.
- It's over!

01:27:42.499 --> 01:27:43.509
DONE!

01:27:45.949 --> 01:27:47.859
Now the whole world...

01:27:48.039 --> 01:27:49.329
...will know.

01:27:54.039 --> 01:27:56.959
The world will know
we have done crimes.

01:27:57.459 --> 01:28:00.479
Hope you don't mind
that I requested you.

01:28:01.019 --> 01:28:02.759
No, I'm glad.

01:28:04.639 --> 01:28:05.609
God!

01:28:05.779 --> 01:28:09.659
I feel shitty.
I think I've got bronchitis.

01:28:09.749 --> 01:28:11.759
Kind of makes your voice sound sexy.

01:28:11.779 --> 01:28:12.799
Thank you.

01:28:13.649 --> 01:28:15.889
So, how's the romance going?

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:19.709
It's alright. It's pretty good.

01:28:21.809 --> 01:28:23.809
What's that all about for you?

01:28:24.419 --> 01:28:26.859
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know...

01:28:27.019 --> 01:28:28.579
...the burn thing?

01:28:29.429 --> 01:28:31.319
Was it creepy...

01:28:32.969 --> 01:28:34.619
...to fuck her?

01:28:37.859 --> 01:28:39.279
Uh, not really.

01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:43.669
Did she take her gloves off?

01:28:48.689 --> 01:28:50.809
Do your friends think it's weird?

01:28:52.009 --> 01:28:53.819
Have your friends even met her?

01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:57.129
I've kind of tried to...

01:28:58.249 --> 01:28:59.899
...try to write a script about it.

01:29:02.369 --> 01:29:06.029
Research.

01:29:06.269 --> 01:29:08.589
Everything is research on some level.

01:29:09.979 --> 01:29:11.969
Mm.

01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:18.839
Would you fuck me if I asked you to?
For research?

01:29:23.219 --> 01:29:25.079
I don't know.

01:29:27.069 --> 01:29:28.529
How would we do it?

01:29:30.359 --> 01:29:32.029
Can you see me?

01:29:33.899 --> 01:29:35.769
Look at what I'm doing.

01:29:37.999 --> 01:29:39.529
How would we fuck?

01:29:40.609 --> 01:29:42.369
From behind.

01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:44.979
We could if you want.

01:29:45.829 --> 01:29:47.339
I want.

01:29:47.719 --> 01:29:49.509
For a long time.

01:29:49.849 --> 01:29:51.359
Yeah?

01:29:52.949 --> 01:29:56.409
Am I better looking... than her?

01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:02.469
Yeah.

01:30:03.019 --> 01:30:04.699
And my skin...

01:30:04.849 --> 01:30:06.469
...do I have better skin?

01:30:07.859 --> 01:30:08.789
Yeah.

01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:11.769
And my holes...

01:30:11.769 --> 01:30:13.769
...are my holes better?

01:30:14.459 --> 01:30:16.849
You wanna fuck my holes?

01:30:16.849 --> 01:30:17.709
Yeah.

01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:53.769
I got to go.

01:30:57.269 --> 01:31:00.889
Do me a favor?
Don't get out, just climb over.

01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:25.269
What happened to you?

01:31:26.529 --> 01:31:28.129
I took the bus.

01:31:28.839 --> 01:31:30.569
What's wrong with the car?

01:31:31.369 --> 01:31:32.669
It broke.

01:31:32.939 --> 01:31:35.009
What happened to you yesterday?

01:31:35.549 --> 01:31:37.059
I was sick.

01:31:37.099 --> 01:31:37.869
Yeah.

01:31:38.069 --> 01:31:39.069
I've been sick all week.

01:31:39.069 --> 01:31:42.879
I still manage to get up
at 5 in the morning and work for 14 hours.

01:31:43.009 --> 01:31:44.349
What's wrong with you?

01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:47.849
I think I have the flu.

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:49.989
You're acting really weird.

01:31:50.529 --> 01:31:52.169
You're dirty.

01:31:52.649 --> 01:31:54.069
I'm sorry.

01:31:54.449 --> 01:31:57.279
Was it too much
trouble to just like text?

01:31:58.459 --> 01:31:59.459
I'm sorry.

01:32:00.089 --> 01:32:02.049
Stop saying that.

01:32:02.109 --> 01:32:03.929
Uh... you know.

01:32:04.379 --> 01:32:07.369
Maybe this isn't working out.
Maybe you need to just go back to Florida.

01:32:07.429 --> 01:32:08.259
You know.

01:32:08.769 --> 01:32:11.349
Go back to Kansas, Dorothy.
It's fine.

01:32:11.409 --> 01:32:16.099
But, I wish you wouldn't just sit there,
like that because it's creeping me out.

01:32:18.989 --> 01:32:20.519
You smell.

01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:22.889
You smell! You hear me?

01:32:23.099 --> 01:32:25.009
Go home and take a bath!

01:32:25.269 --> 01:32:26.809
I'm sorry.

01:32:27.809 --> 01:32:29.489
Oh my God!

01:32:29.689 --> 01:32:31.029
You bled!

01:32:31.079 --> 01:32:33.849
Don't you...
don't you use fucking Tampax?!

01:32:33.849 --> 01:32:35.489
Are you psychotic?

01:32:35.559 --> 01:32:36.299
I'm sorry.

01:32:36.369 --> 01:32:39.499
I don't... I don't believe this.
My... my crazy assistant just...

01:32:39.549 --> 01:32:42.719
...bled on my 12000 dollar couch!

01:32:42.739 --> 01:32:44.819
I don't want you in my life!

01:32:44.889 --> 01:32:46.489
You sick fucking pig!

01:32:46.489 --> 01:32:47.849
I'm sorry, I'll pay for...

01:32:47.849 --> 01:32:51.159
Go to the kitchen and
get Pari A and bleach.

01:32:51.159 --> 01:32:53.179
And Google the best way
to get rid of a stain.

01:32:53.179 --> 01:32:54.829
I... I pick you up off the streets.

01:32:54.829 --> 01:32:56.909
I give you money
so you could be late for work.

01:32:56.999 --> 01:33:00.069
And have you period on my furniture!

01:33:00.129 --> 01:33:02.359
Do you... do you think that Carrie Fisher...

01:33:02.359 --> 01:33:05.719
Do you... do you think
Nicole Kidman and Halle Berry

01:33:05.719 --> 01:33:07.979
have scary little animals working for them?

01:33:07.979 --> 01:33:09.789
Scary, deformed...

01:34:03.319 --> 01:34:04.709
Hi, Agatha.

01:34:05.809 --> 01:34:07.189
Benjie.

01:34:07.269 --> 01:34:08.969
I went AWOL and...

01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:11.939
I told an orderly that if
he let me leave slip out then...

01:34:12.029 --> 01:34:14.869
I give him... 10000 dollars.

01:34:15.789 --> 01:34:17.929
Douche bag star fucker.

01:34:23.729 --> 01:34:25.179
How did you find me?

01:34:25.449 --> 01:34:27.079
You said you worked for her.

01:34:28.569 --> 01:34:30.919
And I've been up here before, so...

01:34:33.789 --> 01:34:35.139
Where's Havana?

01:34:35.379 --> 01:34:39.479
She went to the Canyon Ranch.
Damien gave her a couple of days off.

01:34:47.909 --> 01:34:49.729
I'm lost Agatha.

01:34:51.259 --> 01:34:53.869
I couldn't go to Rhetts and
I can't go home.

01:34:54.719 --> 01:34:58.619
Benjie, you have to listen to me
because there is nothing else.

01:34:58.689 --> 01:35:00.829
It's all ending now.
Do you understand?

01:35:02.439 --> 01:35:04.249
This is Christina's.

01:35:04.399 --> 01:35:06.589
You've got to get daddy's,
can you do that?

01:35:06.759 --> 01:35:09.009
Can you go to the house and
get daddy's ring?

01:35:11.869 --> 01:35:14.409
We're gonna keep it quiet
as long as we can.

01:35:14.409 --> 01:35:16.949
I don't want anything
interfering with the book tour.

01:35:17.039 --> 01:35:18.799
Worse case...

01:35:18.869 --> 01:35:20.809
I go on Oprah again.

01:35:20.919 --> 01:35:22.439
'Fess up.

01:35:22.439 --> 01:35:24.809
Do the whole Lance Armstrong thing.

01:35:25.449 --> 01:35:28.079
That'll build us a fresh money stream.

01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:33.729
So, we kick it off Monday morning.
With GMA, play as it plays.

01:35:34.409 --> 01:35:35.719
Ciao.

01:36:04.769 --> 01:36:06.189
Christina?!

01:36:06.889 --> 01:36:08.329
Christina?!

01:36:14.349 --> 01:36:16.019
Christina?!

01:36:32.729 --> 01:36:33.939
Christina!?

01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:35.809
Christina!

01:37:14.409 --> 01:37:15.289
Dad?!

01:37:17.789 --> 01:37:19.129
Dad?

01:38:17.469 --> 01:38:19.749
I haven't taken these many before.

01:38:27.729 --> 01:38:29.749
That was so brave of you.

01:38:30.739 --> 01:38:32.549
To go back there.

01:38:33.689 --> 01:38:35.999
I just slipped it off his finger.

01:38:37.309 --> 01:38:39.229
Just like he wanted me to have it.

01:39:23.719 --> 01:39:25.079
We should start.

01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:28.939
I've had 13 summers.

01:39:29.269 --> 01:39:30.889
Not so bad.

01:39:32.529 --> 01:39:34.079
Not so bad.

01:39:43.429 --> 01:39:44.769
By this ring.

01:39:44.829 --> 01:39:46.029
By this ring.

01:39:46.119 --> 01:39:47.549
You are consecrated to me.

01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:49.549
I am consecrated to you.

01:39:49.849 --> 01:39:51.129
As my husband.

01:39:51.379 --> 01:39:52.989
As your husband.

01:40:01.899 --> 01:40:04.269
- By this ring.
- By this ring.

01:40:04.339 --> 01:40:06.479
You are consecrated
to me as my wife.

01:40:06.569 --> 01:40:08.769
I am consecrated
to you as your wife.

01:40:10.839 --> 01:40:12.709
Make me as a seal
upon your heart.

01:40:14.379 --> 01:40:15.859
You may kiss the bride.

01:40:29.179 --> 01:40:31.189
On absence without desire.

01:40:31.279 --> 01:40:33.189
On absence without desire.

01:40:33.589 --> 01:40:35.265
On naked solitude.

01:40:35.281 --> 01:40:37.109
On naked solitude.

01:40:37.237 --> 01:40:39.709
On the stairs of death,
I write your name.

01:40:39.725 --> 01:40:42.025
On the stairs of death,
I write your name.

01:40:42.445 --> 01:40:44.269
On health that has returned.

01:40:44.377 --> 01:40:45.909
On health that has returned.

01:40:45.909 --> 01:40:47.909
On danger that is left.

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:49.821
On danger that is left.

01:40:50.137 --> 01:40:51.857
On hope without memory.

01:40:51.849 --> 01:40:53.329
I write your name.

01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:56.333
On hope without memory,
I write your name.

01:40:56.481 --> 01:40:58.541
And by the power of a word.

01:40:58.573 --> 01:41:00.209
By the power of a word.

01:41:00.265 --> 01:41:01.781
I renew my life.

01:41:01.833 --> 01:41:03.305
I renew my life.

01:41:03.441 --> 01:41:08.489
I was born to know you and
to name you.

01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:10.589
Liberty.

01:41:11.325 --> 01:41:12.441
Liberty.
