00:10.578 --> 00:12.578
- How you doing, roy?
- I's all right.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.147
- I understand you havin'
problems with your landlord.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.116
- Ain't that the truth.

00:17.118 --> 00:20.519
He told me I gotta pay my rent
or move on out.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.488
- I suppose his words
moved you to tears.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.555
- Nope.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.624
They moved me
to the sidewalk.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.763
- I tried to get me a job
the other day.

00:30.765 --> 00:31.764
- Yeah?

00:31.766 --> 00:33.432
How much they 'gon pay?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.300
- They said they's gonna
pay me what I's worth.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.369
well, that ain't fair.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.738
You gotta make some money.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.186
- Look at the rain.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.254
Hold on.
There you go.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.255
Ready?

00:56.257 --> 00:58.090
One, two, three, go!

00:58.092 --> 00:59.425
Go, go!

01:26.320 --> 01:28.420
That nigger's wetter than
a well digger's ass.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.664
- Damn it.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.581
- All right.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.350
Nigger's got a kid in the car.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.619
You stay here, hap.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.822
Hold down the wagon train.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.157
You stay put, you hear?

02:09.497 --> 02:11.897
- It's a hell of a night
for this.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.532
Don't worry, I'm just here
to help.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.134
- Thank you, sir.
- What's going on?

02:15.136 --> 02:16.368
- I don't know.

02:16.370 --> 02:19.605
- Take a look at that.
- All right.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.840
- Light that up for me?
- Sure thing.

02:43.697 --> 02:44.897
- Think I know what's happening.

03:34.848 --> 03:38.984
So this is what a working coon
gets these days?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.752
It's damn nice.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.254
I was expecting an outhouse,

03:42.256 --> 03:44.756
A couple of chickens
on the porch.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.392
And you bleeding-heart liberals
think there's something wrong

03:47.394 --> 03:48.393
With this country?

03:48.395 --> 03:49.828
Come on.
Out.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.836
- Any ideas?

03:57.838 --> 04:00.739
- I got an idea.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.907
Shut up.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.475
Get out of the van.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.287
- Paco.

04:52.925 --> 04:54.459
You have to stop this.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.963
Why?

04:57.965 --> 05:00.399
- Everything we worked for,

05:00.401 --> 05:02.301
You're throwin' it away.

05:02.303 --> 05:05.537
- Do you know how much
a new face cost?

05:05.539 --> 05:09.408
- Why is there talking?

05:09.410 --> 05:12.344
Is she laying a guilt trip
on you, paco?

05:12.346 --> 05:13.578
we we're a team.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.847
Shit like that?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.015
Check this out, doodles.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.383
Hey, paco, where's the money?

05:18.385 --> 05:19.651
- They buried it in the barn.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.420
Ooh.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.654
Money wins every time.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.722
Angel, baby.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.924
- Yeah?
- Find us a shovel.

05:42.742 --> 05:43.742
hap.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.410
yeah?

05:45.412 --> 05:49.348
- You see any chance,
don't you hesitate.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.718
- Just don't go
all rambo on me

05:52.720 --> 05:55.554
Or we'll end up like chub.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.722
- Damn fool.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.692
Sticking his neck out
for me.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.514
- Dig.
Jig.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.883
Can you dig it?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.651
"warriors"?
Anybody?

06:34.861 --> 06:37.095
- Soldier.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.931
Now, what if I--
what if we just agreed to...

06:39.933 --> 06:42.167
Split the money?

06:42.169 --> 06:44.436
Just split it?

06:44.438 --> 06:46.671
- Yeah, we could just split it
'cause this is a--

06:46.673 --> 06:48.507
This whole thing is a charity
drive and I'm a--

06:48.509 --> 06:49.541
I'm a generous individual.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.542
No, I get all the money.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.610
We get all the money.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.482
- Wh--what I mean is,
I could take the money

06:57.484 --> 07:00.485
And--and,
I could probably double,

07:00.487 --> 07:01.753
Triple your investment.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.155
What are you gonna do with it?

07:03.157 --> 07:04.790
- For starters,

07:04.792 --> 07:06.925
We're gonna do
whatever the hell we want,

07:06.927 --> 07:09.961
Howie, and then...

07:09.963 --> 07:12.831
After that,

07:12.833 --> 07:16.168
I'm gonna buy the biggest rock
that I can find

07:16.170 --> 07:20.872
And I'm gonna put it on
the finger of this lovely thing,

07:20.874 --> 07:24.142
And make her an honest woman.
Okay?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.777
Not too honest.
Not very honest at all,

07:25.779 --> 07:29.147
But she will be the biggest
trophy wife

07:29.149 --> 07:31.149
The world has ever known.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.089
I said dig.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.524
Come on.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.576
Eureka.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.145
Lenny, help me out, would you?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.514
Len, could you help me out
please?

08:02.516 --> 08:04.850
Get down there.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.942
- Paco.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.577
Come over here, please.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.621
- Well, that ain't good.
- No, for them it's not good.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.955
Hey, howie.
How--how is that foot?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.123
- No.
- How is the other foot?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.291
- It was--
- howie.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.659
- It was there.
- Howie.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.160
- I--I swear.
Paco saw it.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.930
Paco! You saw it.
- It was there!

08:51.932 --> 08:53.565
no, shh.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.233
Don't.
Stop whining.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.768
Stop whining 'cause that's
getting on my nerves and I--

08:57.771 --> 08:59.137
- I have sensitive nerves.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.942
Baby, can you give me that,
please?

09:03.944 --> 09:06.912
Thank you.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.613
Howie, come here, would you?

09:08.615 --> 09:11.917
Would you come--could you stand
right here for me?

09:11.919 --> 09:13.184
ooh!

09:13.186 --> 09:16.054
- Where's the money?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.822
- Howie.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.157
- I didn't touch it.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.258
I didn't touch it.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.593
- Then who did?

09:21.595 --> 09:22.961
who did?

09:22.963 --> 09:25.330
- Howie, who did?

09:25.332 --> 09:27.332
- who did?

09:27.334 --> 09:29.868
- I moved it!

09:29.870 --> 09:32.637
- Say what?
- You heard me!

09:32.639 --> 09:35.840
I moved it someplace
you'll never find it!

09:39.846 --> 09:42.614
- The biggest balls in this room
are swingin' from a cooch.

09:42.616 --> 09:43.949
I got to love that.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.857
Trudy...

09:52.859 --> 09:55.126
What do you say you and I,
we have a heart to heart now?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.695
Yeah, let's do that.
Come on.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.863
Come over.
You're gonna come over here now.

10:00.132 --> 10:02.167
uh-uh-uh.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.869
Don't be smart, fellas.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.606
Dumb suits you much better.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.185
- This is a sweet set-up
he's got here?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.123
Gonna marry
that woman in there.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.392
I'm gonna take her
someplace like this.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.830
South america maybe.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.732
House on the beach,

10:33.734 --> 10:36.234
Fruit trees...

10:37.804 --> 10:39.037
That stuff costs money though,

10:39.039 --> 10:41.239
And it's money
that you hid from me.

10:47.079 --> 10:49.714
Are you scared?

10:53.886 --> 10:56.221
I don't blame you.
I'm scary stuff.

11:12.204 --> 11:15.774
What's the place you work
called again?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.442
- Family burger.
- That's the one.

11:17.444 --> 11:20.011
Gosh, you see those places
everywhere now?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.746
What do they pay?
Minimum wage?

11:21.748 --> 11:23.748
Less?

11:23.750 --> 11:25.283
And what is that?
Two, three bucks an hour?

11:25.285 --> 11:28.119
Tips if you smile?

11:28.121 --> 11:31.756
You like serving truckers,
fat kids for that kind of money?

11:31.758 --> 11:33.958
'cause I think a woman like you,
a woman who looks like you

11:33.960 --> 11:36.995
Should aim higher
and not for nothing.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.131
You're not getting
any younger, trudy.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.200
Listen, eventually folks
are gonna find those cops,

11:42.202 --> 11:43.234
And this place gonna
get hotter

11:43.236 --> 11:44.703
Than the devil's ass crack,

11:44.705 --> 11:47.405
And I just don't have
the time to wait.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.774
So here's what I'm gonna do.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.845
I'm gonna give this back to you.
All of it.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.214
You can get yourself a new
dress, a new hairdo, whatever,

11:56.216 --> 11:58.950
And I'll even sweeten the pot,
okay?

11:58.952 --> 12:00.318
And which--which car is yours?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.986
I'm gonna let you ride
that beater out of here

12:01.988 --> 12:04.155
And leave all this shit behind.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.357
You'll never see me again.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.928
All you got to do is tell me
what I want to know.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.364
What do you say?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.839
This is your call, sister.

12:51.905 --> 12:52.937
Come on.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.506
- Come on.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.109
please.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.410
Baby.
Baby.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.447
- Angel, baby.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.317
The sun's almost comin' up,
and I'm just so hungry

13:06.319 --> 13:10.155
I could eat the balls
off a low-flying duck.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.423
Could you whip us up some
french toast?

13:12.425 --> 13:15.360
And after that, I'm gonna go
to work on this bitch.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.067
I love these placemats.

13:59.306 --> 14:02.941
- Found these in
casanova's bedside table.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.247
Kinky little son of a bitch,
ain't ya?

14:09.249 --> 14:10.515
- Ask your mother.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.250
- Or your poppa.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.898
Hey.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.166
Where'd you hide it?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.001
- I can't remember.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.870
- Okay.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.906
You do know that angel and me
can help you remember, right?

14:34.908 --> 14:37.642
- We have plans for that money.

14:37.644 --> 14:38.977
You just want to spend it.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.545
- What are you, a communist?

14:40.547 --> 14:43.581
That's what money's for.
It's for spending.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.050
This is america.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.352
- And you're what's wrong
with it.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.623
- We need that money
to change things.

14:53.192 --> 14:55.960
- And I thought the syrup
was too sweet.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.629
You poor bastards.

14:57.631 --> 15:00.465
The '60s are over and you just
don't even know it yet.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.367
You had your chance,

15:02.369 --> 15:05.470
And you failed
because of a simple reason:

15:05.472 --> 15:08.139
People suck,
and they want everything.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.308
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

15:10.310 --> 15:11.676
Your own ex-wife
double crossed you.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.344
Cost you a toe
and almost a nut,

15:13.346 --> 15:15.346
And you're gonna buy her shit?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.916
- I did it for the cause.

15:17.918 --> 15:21.519
- Do you believe that, howie?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.488
Is she a true believer

15:23.490 --> 15:25.590
Or is she just doing this
for herself?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.526
'cause I want to find that out,

15:28.528 --> 15:32.130
And I'm not gonna ask you again.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.398
Where's the money?

15:38.305 --> 15:41.239
- Trudy, will you just tell him?

15:44.411 --> 15:47.245
- I'd rather burn it
than let him have it.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.582
- Who are you?
Joan of arc?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.084
We all know what happened
to her.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.419
Are you ready for that shit?

16:09.134 --> 16:13.037
Angel.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.674
Go on.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.430
It's all country.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.265
Figured you'd be more
of a soul man

16:41.267 --> 16:42.700
Or a funk fella.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.369
- Yeah, well,
country got soul.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.237
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.538
- Okay.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.146
Actually...

16:55.148 --> 16:57.015
You want to hear some real shit?

17:38.524 --> 17:40.291
Hey.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.698
That's a big toolbox, baby.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.736
Let's see what we got here

17:51.738 --> 17:54.172
'cause I am done asking nicely,

17:54.174 --> 17:56.674
But it's gonna feel way longer
to you than it is to me.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.519
I like that.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.855
Baby, could you help me pick out
a couple nails?

18:10.857 --> 18:12.423
About the size of lenny's dick?

18:36.381 --> 18:38.583
Pain's such a great motivator.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.786
I'm not talking about pms.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.888
I'm talking about real pain,

18:43.890 --> 18:45.823
Kind of pain that makes you
want to crawl up inside yourself

18:45.825 --> 18:47.692
And disappear.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.497
Paco, if happy or the buck
make a move,

18:52.499 --> 18:54.499
Could you shoot them
in the knee?

18:54.501 --> 18:56.601
Baby, would you hold her left
hand right there for me?

18:56.603 --> 18:59.604
- No.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.842
- If you hurt someone enough...

19:06.212 --> 19:08.646
- Things become clear
like glass,

19:08.648 --> 19:13.451
And all those lofty ideas,
they just fall away.

19:13.453 --> 19:17.355
And you are left with one truth,

19:17.357 --> 19:20.424
And that truth is
make the pain stop.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.235
- Last chance.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.219
- Well, a drum roll
would be nice.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.221
- Come on, trudy,
just tell him.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.625
- Can't have everything
you want.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.704
- Snap out of it.
Focus up.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.239
Focus up.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.840
- You're gonna tell me
what I want

20:09.842 --> 20:12.543
Because I have a shitload
of nails.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.798
- That's dedication.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.569
That is real.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.338
Has she always been like this,
hap?

20:40.340 --> 20:42.840
Come on, no wonder you guys
couldn't work it out.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.376
I bet she hogged the remote
and shit.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.545
- She's not gonna talk,

20:47.547 --> 20:51.449
And hurting her again
won't work.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.354
- Well, now I--
now I see why she settled

20:56.356 --> 20:57.822
For this weak fart over here.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.860
He lets her do whatever
she wants.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.695
She goes behind his back,

21:04.697 --> 21:06.797
And she steals his money

21:06.799 --> 21:10.601
For his cause while she's giving
you the pink kitty.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.337
Now he's gonna walk the plank
for her.

21:13.339 --> 21:15.339
Howie, when this is all over,

21:15.341 --> 21:18.676
She's just gonna come crying
back to you...

21:18.678 --> 21:21.879
And she's gonna be saying
she did it all for you,

21:21.881 --> 21:24.849
And she's gonna bat
her little eyes,

21:24.851 --> 21:28.619
And then she's gonna string you
along again, man.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.888
When's the last time
she humped you, pal?

21:34.027 --> 21:36.460
I could get her to talk.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.895
- Say again?

21:43.503 --> 21:46.003
Could you say that
a little louder?

21:46.005 --> 21:49.040
I don't think she heard you.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.375
- I can get her to talk.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.344
- After what I just did to her?

21:55.715 --> 21:58.482
- Hurting her won't work.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.785
- Okay, enlighten me.

22:02.588 --> 22:04.455
- You have to hurt him.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.990
- You son of a bitch.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.560
- That is rich.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.000
- Did you hear that, baby?

22:18.404 --> 22:20.771
That was the sound
of howie's balls dropping.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.410
We ain't in the '60s anymore,
are we, howie?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.450
Stand up for me, professor.

22:43.595 --> 22:44.729
Would you take that?

22:44.731 --> 22:45.996
I want you to take that.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.733
- No.
- Take that for me.

22:55.575 --> 22:58.809
And now I want you to hit happy
in the mouth with it.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.378
I want you to hit him
as hard as you can.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.545
I want you to see how many teeth
you can break

23:01.547 --> 23:02.747
On the first swing.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.148
- I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.616
- You don't,
I'll shoot you in the head.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.650
You too if you even move.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.452
- God damn it.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.820
- And I want you
to keep swinging

23:09.822 --> 23:11.389
Until doodie bird here sings,

23:11.391 --> 23:12.823
Or you can just answer
the question.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.025
howie.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.694
No.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.062
- You gonna listen to him,
howard?

23:18.064 --> 23:19.764
- He doesn't have a choice.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.031
no.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.833
- Tell him! Just tell him!
- Howie...

23:22.835 --> 23:24.935
- Trudy, will you just tell him
where the god damn money is?

23:24.937 --> 23:26.170
- Great idea, trudy,
just tell me.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.406
Two.
- Howard, don't!

23:28.408 --> 23:29.540
- Sorry.
- 2 1/2.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.641
- No!
- Three!

23:30.643 --> 23:31.709
- No!
- I'm sorry!

23:31.711 --> 23:34.745
- Don't!
Not on my watch.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.046
- Stop!
No!

23:36.048 --> 23:37.081
Wait, wait, wait!

23:37.083 --> 23:38.716
I--I know where the money is!

23:38.718 --> 23:40.117
- Nice try.
- No, I do.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.586
I was sitting out on the porch
and I saw her come in,

23:42.588 --> 23:44.955
And--and I saw what was on
her shoes.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.690
- I don't want shoes!
I want money, hap!

23:46.692 --> 23:47.958
- I know where the money is

23:47.960 --> 23:50.761
Because of what I saw
on her shoes!

23:52.899 --> 23:54.598
Just give me a shovel...

23:56.002 --> 23:57.468
And I give you the money.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.111
- Well, now we're cookin'
with gas.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.746
Okay.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.581
Did you hear that, baby?

24:10.583 --> 24:12.583
He's gonna give us the money.

24:15.054 --> 24:17.221
You're all right, hap.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.689
I think I could get to like you.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.492
- I will never like you.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.093
I'll give you the money

24:23.095 --> 24:25.930
If you--if you'll let us go,

24:25.932 --> 24:28.466
And that's all of us,
including her.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.501
- Have I said
anything different?

24:30.503 --> 24:32.570
It's what I've been sayin'
all along, hap.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.508
You went all in, didn't you,
howie?

24:43.549 --> 24:45.049
But you call yourself a hippie?

24:48.054 --> 24:51.055
- God, no!

24:53.926 --> 24:54.925
I hate duplicity in a man.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.126
No offense to you, paco.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.064
Let's go get that money, hap.

26:06.698 --> 26:08.699
- Stay here, paco.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.334
Keep the eye on that one.

26:23.181 --> 26:25.282
Happy, hap, happy,

26:25.284 --> 26:27.918
What is with you and that crazy
asshole inside?

26:27.920 --> 26:31.221
She just stinks of trouble, man.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.290
She got a honey puss
or what?

26:33.292 --> 26:34.992
Not that I am interested.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.694
- I'd appreciate it if you
didn't talk about her.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.695
- It's a sore spot?

26:37.697 --> 26:38.796
You know, believe it or not,

26:38.798 --> 26:39.964
I was with some real
pieces of shit

26:39.966 --> 26:41.999
Before my angel baby here
came along.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.200
Where are we going?

26:43.202 --> 26:45.903
- Over there.
Dog pens.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.771
- All right.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.680
- Hey, boy.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.682
Hey.
Hey, switch.

26:58.684 --> 26:59.683
Good boy.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.219
- Where's the money?
- Hey.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.221
It's in one of those pens.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.656
I don't know which one.

27:05.658 --> 27:07.324
- Then how do you know
it is here, hap?

27:07.326 --> 27:09.760
- 'cause I saw the dog shit
on her shoes.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.729
- Are you sure?

27:11.731 --> 27:13.163
- I'm bettin' my life on it.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.234
- Damn right you are.

27:18.703 --> 27:20.804
Open it.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.291
- Come on, switch.
Come here, boy.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.793
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

27:42.795 --> 27:44.194
What are you doing?

27:44.196 --> 27:47.297
- I got to take him out so I can
go in there and dig.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.999
- Okay.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.301
All right.
All right.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.970
- Good boy.
Good boy, switch.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.004
Say hello to mr. Soldier.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.239
- Hey, okay, man.
- Ouch!

28:08.954 --> 28:10.821
you bitch!

28:12.224 --> 28:13.891
- Hey!

28:31.310 --> 28:33.077
- Run, swtich!

28:33.079 --> 28:34.378
Run for the woods!

28:46.726 --> 28:49.393
- Aah!

28:59.071 --> 29:00.070
- Get up!
Come on!

29:00.072 --> 29:03.373
Let's go!

29:05.845 --> 29:06.844
- Bitch!

29:12.952 --> 29:14.952
- God damn it,
you've been hit.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.054
- No, keep goin'.
Come on.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.824
Keep goin'!
Hap!

29:20.826 --> 29:22.860
Don't you even think about
askin' me to go in there!

29:22.862 --> 29:24.261
We keep runnin'!

29:24.263 --> 29:26.764
We hit the road, flag down
a car, and call the cops!

29:26.766 --> 29:28.165
Come on!

29:28.801 --> 29:30.834
- Come on, we can't just
leave her there, man.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.102
- Yes, we can!

29:32.104 --> 29:34.271
That bitch brought
all this shit down on us!

29:34.273 --> 29:36.840
On our heads and for what?
Money?

29:36.842 --> 29:38.475
Ain't no money worth dying for,
hap.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.544
- Come on, that's bullshit,
man, and you know it.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.246
You would never run away from
a fight in your life!

29:42.248 --> 29:44.181
- This ain't no
god damn fight!

29:44.183 --> 29:46.250
They 'gon kill us
or we're 'gon kill them.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.987
This is war!

29:49.989 --> 29:53.090
I've been there, hap.
You ain't.

29:53.092 --> 29:55.292
You ready for that?

30:21.586 --> 30:25.022
Put it out!
Put it out!

30:44.143 --> 30:47.044
- God damn, that man loved
putting his head on fire.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.547
You want to go finish
this off, baby?

32:11.030 --> 32:12.329
- Go. Get.
Stay down.

32:12.331 --> 32:13.330
In the corner.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.598
- No!
What have you done?

32:16.068 --> 32:18.235
You shitheads!
- God!

32:18.237 --> 32:19.436
You ain't hit again?

32:19.438 --> 32:20.504
- God damn it!

32:20.506 --> 32:22.205
- Dear god!

32:24.009 --> 32:25.509
- You okay?

32:25.511 --> 32:27.277
- She fine.
I'm the one that's shot.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.281
- Where he at?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.951
- I don't know.
I can't see him.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.590
Trudy...

32:40.592 --> 32:42.459
You got to get that out.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.961
Come here.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.096
On the count of three.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.597
One,

32:47.599 --> 32:49.199
Two,

32:49.201 --> 32:50.400
Three.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.537
- Here.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.405
- Here.
Here.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.374
Wrap it 'round.
Hold it tight.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.644
that's it. Real tight.

33:00.646 --> 33:04.247
god damn it. God damn it.

33:04.249 --> 33:08.085
We gotta find something
to cut the chain.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.124
- Come on.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.595
Call 911.
- Yeah.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.430
9--come on--

33:20.432 --> 33:21.631
1, 1.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.236
The phone's dead.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.538
- They must've cut the line.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.141
Shit.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.214
- Hey, come on.
Come on.

33:37.216 --> 33:38.782
All right.
Yeah.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.283
Come on.
This way.

33:40.285 --> 33:42.686
Shh.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.321
Okay.

33:44.323 --> 33:46.390
All right, come here.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.793
Baby, shh.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.361
Shh.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.196
okay.

34:00.472 --> 34:01.471
Shh.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.276
- Shh.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.280
- That went clean through.

34:10.282 --> 34:13.350
You're gonna be okay.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.518
- Baby, I'm sorry.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.754
- Come on,
this ain't your fault.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.824
It ain't your fault.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.592
How you doing?

34:24.563 --> 34:27.664
I don't feel too good.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.233
- You look great.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.070
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.138
Name says it all.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.339
Just like an angel.

34:40.712 --> 34:43.280
You know, when we get that
money, I'm gonna--

34:43.282 --> 34:47.284
I'm gonna take you right
to acapulco like I promised.

34:47.286 --> 34:50.687
Sunshine, sand, salt,
that is our future.

34:50.688 --> 34:53.623
We're just gonna rest up
here for a bit first.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.092
Okay?

34:55.094 --> 34:56.760
- Sure?
- Yeah.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.798
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Okay. Shh.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.400
I got it.
I got it.

35:05.571 --> 35:09.139
They're not gonna get away
with what they did.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.141
Daddy's gonna take care
of everything.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.445
Who's my girl?

35:15.447 --> 35:16.880
- I am.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.216
- Yeah.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.485
Yeah.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.782
god damn it.

36:14.173 --> 36:15.238
holy shit.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.274
God.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.388
- So how's it feel?

36:31.390 --> 36:32.889
Shootin' something
that ain't a target?

36:32.891 --> 36:35.559
- I don't know.

36:35.561 --> 36:39.529
I haven't had a chance
to think about it yet.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.464
- You will.

36:44.268 --> 36:45.302
- You came back.

36:49.941 --> 36:53.443
- So why'd you move the money?
Really.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.446
- The drugs.
Leonard was right.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.481
- Shit, you'll just say
anything now.

36:58.483 --> 36:59.649
She need us.
- That's not true.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.551
- Bullshit.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.887
You was gonna take that money
for yourself and you know it.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.689
- That money was meant
for something good!

37:05.691 --> 37:07.357
- Shh, shh, shh, settle down.
Both of you.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.759
- I hope it was worth it
when we are all lying here dead.

37:09.761 --> 37:10.794
- God.

37:10.796 --> 37:11.995
You're bleeding out real fast.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.463
- We got to get him
to the hospital.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.332
- Yeah, how we gonna do that?

37:15.334 --> 37:16.833
- We can go for the van.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.635
- What?
Hasn't soldier got the keys?

37:18.637 --> 37:20.637
- Howard always kept an extra
set on him.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.508
- We go ahead
and make a run for it.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.845
- I got half a leg,
two pints of blood.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.614
I ain't running nowhere.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.651
- Okay.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.720
Trudy, you're gonna have to go.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.955
Get the keys,

37:38.957 --> 37:42.626
Get the van,
bring it over to the porch.

37:42.628 --> 37:45.328
I'll carry him if I have to.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.430
- Go out there?

37:47.432 --> 37:50.467
- Well, he can't walk.

37:50.469 --> 37:54.304
I can't drag him if--and move.

37:54.306 --> 37:57.407
Well, it's either that or...

37:57.409 --> 37:59.676
We're just gonna sit here and--

37:59.678 --> 38:01.411
And bleed to death.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.580
- Shit.
- Shh.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.382
- I'm scared.

38:10.022 --> 38:11.888
- I'd be more worried
if you weren't.

38:11.890 --> 38:15.358
- Hell.
The way you stood up to soldier,

38:15.360 --> 38:18.061
This ought to be a piece of cake
for a big ol' martyr like you.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.729
- Yeah, you're not making this
any easier, you know that?

38:19.731 --> 38:22.832
- Hap. Hap.

38:24.369 --> 38:26.469
We get through this,

38:26.471 --> 38:28.405
I'll never leave you again.

38:37.548 --> 38:40.383
That was just in case.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.553
- Yeah, okay.

38:43.555 --> 38:46.523
Now you go
and get those keys?

39:00.339 --> 39:01.905
- shit.

39:01.907 --> 39:05.675
- Damn.

39:35.406 --> 39:37.907
That's it.
Come on, girl.

39:37.909 --> 39:40.477
Okay, okay.
Okay, got the keys.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.414
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's go.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.715
Come on.

40:20.152 --> 40:22.719
That's it.
- Good girl.

40:32.931 --> 40:33.930
- Sh--

40:36.468 --> 40:39.469
- Come on, girl.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.770
Come on, girl.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.705
Come on.
- Come on.

40:44.609 --> 40:48.178
Come on!
Come on, trudy! Come on.

40:49.747 --> 40:51.014
- No, no.
