MAN: Previously on
Almost Family...

00:03.829 --> 00:05.657
Dr. Bechley,
my source says that you used

00:05.701 --> 00:08.660
your own sperm to impregnate
a patient at your practice.

00:08.704 --> 00:11.098
-I stacked the deck.
-How many, Dad?

00:11.141 --> 00:13.187
LEON: I never kept
a formal record.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.666
Do you wanna get
a sister selfie?

00:14.710 --> 00:16.277
-Nope.
-No way.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.062
-We're genetically connected.
-Family.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.803
Finding a new family
is the best thing

00:20.846 --> 00:22.370
that's happened to me
in years.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.111
Kind of in a fight

00:24.154 --> 00:25.503
who are also my parents.

EDIE: My whole life,
it's all coming apart.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.377

such a broken person

00:31.814 --> 00:33.337
Here's our warrant
to confiscate items

00:33.381 --> 00:34.599
related to the investigation.

00:34.643 --> 00:36.079
You need a defense attorney.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.776
I was hoping that you could
represent the clinic.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.430
Maybe you need
to ask yourself

00:39.474 --> 00:40.605
why you're still
protecting him.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.259
In the house,
there's a laptop computer.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.695
I need you to destroy it.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.307
Bechley's misuse
of his genetic material

00:46.350 --> 00:48.091
rises to the level
of sexual assault,

00:48.135 --> 00:50.050
and we intend
to prosecute it as such.

to even be here.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.769

This is home for all of us.

but not as much

09:10.114 --> 09:13.161

health insurance.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.306
What do you want?

09:28.350 --> 09:29.525
You need a second to gloat?

09:29.569 --> 09:30.874
You win.
You got rid of me.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.354
Julia, nobody wanted
to get rid--

09:32.397 --> 09:36.227
My dad did this,
not me, okay?

09:36.271 --> 09:38.186
My entire life got turned
upside down

09:38.229 --> 09:40.841
and the only thing that
I had left was this stupid job.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.320

09:58.032 --> 09:59.511
in the community.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.426
He's internationally recognized
for his work.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.777
All reasons he's
a potential flight risk.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.083
Financial resources,
international contacts.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.824
He's not James Bond.

10:07.868 --> 10:11.045
He's a doctor with years
of service to the community.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.873
He's also a criminal,

10:12.916 --> 10:15.527
and given the damage he did,
the deception he practiced,

10:15.571 --> 10:18.095
that community is better off
with him under house arrest

10:18.139 --> 10:19.749
in his nice,
big apartment.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.969
Okay, I think I have enough
to deliberate on,

10:22.012 --> 10:24.058
Counselors.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.016
Nice to know it's a crime
to have a big apartment.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.583
I wouldn't know, counselor.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.498
-I'm on a government salary.

10:29.541 --> 10:30.542
That didn't stop you
from buying

10:30.586 --> 10:32.501
this season's Chloe boots.

10:32.544 --> 10:35.852
-Can't live on bread alone.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.468
The Andersons are coming in
for a check-up tomorrow.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.775
She's fine
but the husband is a mess,

10:45.819 --> 10:47.951
so, um--he's obsessed
with the Jets,

10:47.995 --> 10:49.910
which--I know--is sad.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.389
Watch the game tonight
and then tomorrow

10:51.433 --> 10:52.956
when they come in
maybe talk about it with him.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.392
-It'll calm him down.
-JAN: Got it.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.090
Debby Goldman is bringing
in her baby

10:56.133 --> 10:58.092
for a visit on Wednesday.

10:58.135 --> 10:59.441
Make sure you get a good
picture for the wall,

10:59.484 --> 11:01.443
and let her know that I will
be there for the bris.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.532
And Grace Fields has been
trying to have a baby

11:03.575 --> 11:04.925
with us for
the past five years,

11:04.968 --> 11:06.578
and if this next round
doesn't go well,

11:06.622 --> 11:09.364
she's going to be a wreck,
so take good care of her.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.800
Okay.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.280
I can't believe this
is happening.

11:12.323 --> 11:15.239
All right.
I think that's it.

11:15.283 --> 11:18.286
I'm sorry, Julia.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.853
I know.
Thanks, Jan.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.648
I thought I told you t--

11:32.692 --> 11:33.649
LEON: Yeah, I'd like
one favor.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.129
JULIA: No.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.608
LEON: Well, okay,
I would do it myself,

11:36.652 --> 11:38.828
but you turned in my laptop
to the police

11:38.872 --> 11:41.396
and now I--I'm wearing
an ankle bracelet

11:41.439 --> 11:44.355
that talks to a gentleman
from the probation office.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.270
Your timing is horrific.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.272
Okay, I--I'd like you
to bring me, uh,

11:48.316 --> 11:49.665
that drawing that you made
for me.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.275
What drawing?

11:51.319 --> 11:52.450
LEON: Well, you know, the one
that I keep on my desk.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.930
I think you made it
in the third grade.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.410
It says,
"World's Greatest Dad."

11:55.453 --> 11:56.933
I think you made
the stethoscope

11:56.977 --> 11:59.066
out of, uh, spaghetti.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.503
It was macaroni
and pipe cleaners.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.548
Right.
Uh, okay.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.986
But, uh, Julia,
here's the thing.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.597
Could you just--could you just
please, uh, bring it to me?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.512
I mean, you know, they--

12:10.555 --> 12:12.862
They took everything else.

12:12.906 --> 12:16.170
It would--it would mean so much
if I could just have that back.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.388
ROXY: And you all recently
found out that I am in fact

12:17.432 --> 12:19.956
a Bechley baby.
Aww.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.003
And here I am in front
of a wall of babies,

12:23.046 --> 12:26.180
a whole collage of potential
mini mes.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.485
I have to go.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.183
Check it.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.706
Me and this little dude
are total chin twins.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.187
Roxy, we told you this.
You can't film in here.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.492
It's not film.
It's digital.

12:34.536 --> 12:35.972
Okay, okay, listen.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.321
You have to stop doing that,
okay?

12:37.365 --> 12:40.150
-I just told her that.
-ROXY: Hi, Dr. Isaac.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.456
Listen, I don't know
if you heard,

12:41.499 --> 12:43.110
but I'm actually part
of the family now,

12:43.153 --> 12:45.068
so it'd be great if you
could just back off.

12:46.504 --> 12:47.984
ISAAC: Take care of that,
Julia.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.551
This is total crap!

12:49.594 --> 12:50.639
I mean, how can they
do this to you?

12:50.682 --> 12:52.380
Your father is Leon Bechley.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.339
Right, the man whose response
to ruining my life

12:55.383 --> 12:57.428
is asking me to bring him
a drawing I made for him

12:57.472 --> 12:58.560
when I was eight years old.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.257
Aww, that's really sweet.

13:00.301 --> 13:02.694
No, it's not.
It's--you don't know his game.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.392
First I'm bringing him
the drawing.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.263
Next he'll have me picking up
his hand-rolled

13:06.307 --> 13:08.396
tortellini en brodo
from Trattoria Buca.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.224
Trattoria who?

13:10.267 --> 13:11.486
It's his favorite restaurant,

13:11.529 --> 13:13.009
which is terrible
for his health.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.968
And he's probably
not taking his meds.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.578
He just had a heart attack.

13:16.621 --> 13:19.929
Doctors are
the worst patients.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.410
You wanna go see him, huh?

13:22.453 --> 13:24.455
No, I don't.
I wanna kill him.

13:26.980 --> 13:31.419
But it was my job to worry
about him for so long.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.334
You know, I have a little
free time today.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.118
If you want I can go over there
and check on him

13:35.162 --> 13:36.424
and make sure
he's taking his meds

13:36.467 --> 13:38.078
and--and let you know.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.125
Fine.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.431
Fine, just go over there

13:43.474 --> 13:44.432
and make sure that
he's taking his meds.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.173
-All of them.
-Yeah.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.391
-And--and report back to me.
-Okay.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.697
-And no lingering.
-Yeah.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.742
No, listen.
You won't regret this.

13:50.786 --> 13:54.224
-Can I borrow 50 bucks?

13:54.268 --> 13:55.791
Yeah, we're leaving, Mark.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.189
So at the hearing today...

14:02.232 --> 14:03.625
Mm-hmm?

14:03.668 --> 14:06.367
Is it me or was there, like,
a vibe happening

14:06.410 --> 14:08.108
between you and Amanda Doherty?

14:08.151 --> 14:10.588
-I don't know what you mean.
-TIM: I don't know.

14:10.632 --> 14:13.461
It was like the way
she made you laugh,

14:13.504 --> 14:15.202
it was like she
caught you off guard,

14:15.245 --> 14:16.725
and I don't know.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.118
I just feel like I haven't
been able to do that

14:18.161 --> 14:19.684
-for you in a while.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.557
So you were watching
the two of us sparring?

14:22.600 --> 14:24.733
Two women and you got what?

14:24.776 --> 14:26.387
Jealous?

14:26.430 --> 14:28.128
I don't know.
I--I just--

14:28.171 --> 14:30.565
Or did you get turned on?

14:30.608 --> 14:32.088
Both.

14:33.611 --> 14:37.789
Well, um, maybe I can
help you out with that.

14:48.496 --> 14:51.151
Hey.
Hope I'm not interrupting.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.675
Roxy, uh, it's--uh,
it's you.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.155
A little birdie told me
that this

14:55.198 --> 14:56.591
was your favorite restaurant.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.158
Bucca di Beppo.

14:58.201 --> 15:01.509
Oh.
Hmm.

15:01.552 --> 15:02.858
Is this wrong?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.339
No, it's actually
Trattoria Buca,

15:05.382 --> 15:08.342
not, uh, Boopa de--the...

15:08.385 --> 15:10.866
Oh, my God.
I knew I would get it wrong.

15:10.910 --> 15:11.867
I get everything wrong.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.738
You're this fancy person.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.392
I mean, of course you're not
gonna eat from a chain place.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.524
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.655
It's great.
It's okay.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.483
No, no, hang on.
Come on in.

15:19.527 --> 15:22.182
You know, it smells, uh, great.

15:22.225 --> 15:25.185
Um, it's just, uh, you know,
it's new to me,

15:25.228 --> 15:29.189
so I, uh, yeah.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.755
What are, uh, these?

15:32.583 --> 15:34.585
Um, garlic knots.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.544
Oh.

15:36.587 --> 15:37.762
Huh.

15:42.332 --> 15:43.551
That's delicious.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.163
Yeah.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.297
I was so nervous to meet you.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.385
Mm.

15:51.428 --> 15:52.777
This is, like,
the biggest thing

15:52.821 --> 15:54.388
that's happened in my life,
like, ever.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.346
No bigger than landing
that vault at Athens.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.218
Two and a half twists?
Hmm.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.699
Yeah, but I mean, I landed
on my ass in the individuals.

16:01.743 --> 16:02.744
I had to settle for silver.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.920
You didn't settle.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.878
You were robbed.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.924
Come on.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.578
I think so, too.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.362
I mean, and the judging system
is so rigged.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.147
I mean, don't even get me
started on the Romanians.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.279
Yeah, not a huge fan of
the system right now, either.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.457
Hey, listen, you're gonna
beat this case, okay?

16:20.501 --> 16:22.242
And especially with Edie
helping you, I mean,

16:22.285 --> 16:23.591
I thought I was intense.

16:23.634 --> 16:24.940
Pretty sure Edie sleeps
upside down.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.290
-You're in good hands.

16:29.597 --> 16:32.295
Anyway, um,
uh, you seem all right.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.644
Uh, I can't really stay.

16:33.688 --> 16:34.906
Well, you're not
gonna join me?

16:34.950 --> 16:36.647
I mean, I can't eat this
all by myself.

16:36.691 --> 16:42.349
And I wanna hear more about you
and--here you are.

16:42.392 --> 16:46.222
And your--your road
to Olympic glory.

16:46.266 --> 16:47.615
Well, I guess
it would be a shame

16:47.658 --> 16:49.269
to let those knots get cold.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.662
Yeah.
Don't eat all of them.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.232
Oh, ooh.
Sorry.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.407
Hi, hello.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.409
Um, I forgot my bike lock
at home.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.932
Sorry.

17:00.976 --> 17:04.240
Uh--uh, packages go downstairs
through security.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.590
Oh, I'm--I'm not
a bike messenger.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.854
I, um--I'm looking
for Edie Palmer.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.291
And you are?

17:11.334 --> 17:13.771
A new client
and a new sister.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.428
You still worried
about Amanda?

17:18.472 --> 17:20.474
Who's Amanda?

17:22.824 --> 17:26.262
You have no idea how safe
I feel in your arms.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.613
JULIA: Edie?

17:29.657 --> 17:32.486
Julia?

17:32.529 --> 17:33.661
Hello.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.492
Should I put my jacket on?

17:43.236 --> 17:45.281
Can I come in?
Great, thanks.

17:45.325 --> 17:46.369
Hey.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.633
Am I interrupting something?

17:49.677 --> 17:51.461
-No.
-Yes.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.724
What's up, Julia?

17:53.768 --> 17:55.987
They fired me--
the clinic,

17:56.031 --> 17:58.642
and I realize that
I--I can't let them

17:58.686 --> 18:00.383
do that to me, you know?
I...

18:02.690 --> 18:03.952
Are you guys okay?

18:03.995 --> 18:04.996
Were you working out
or something?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.955
No.
You were saying?

18:06.998 --> 18:08.609
Right.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.437
Um, I'm not gonna just
walk away from the clinic

18:10.480 --> 18:12.482
because of my father's actions.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.745
Those patients,
they--they need me,

18:14.789 --> 18:16.704
and I need them.

18:16.747 --> 18:19.315
I brought my employment
agreement because I was hoping

18:19.359 --> 18:20.925
maybe you guys
could look at it.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.492
I don't understand it.

18:22.536 --> 18:26.583
Maybe there's a loophole
or something that, um...

18:27.541 --> 18:29.412
I'm sorry,
is that underwear?

18:34.591 --> 18:37.855
What we do is our business
or pleasure.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.379
It's both.
We're married.

18:39.422 --> 18:40.771
I know.

18:40.815 --> 18:43.513
I'm not an employment lawyer,
but I'd be happy

18:43.557 --> 18:44.819
to take a look
at this contract.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.037
-I'm sure I could help.
-JULIA: Thank you.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.822
That's very nice of you.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.737
Also, you staying away
from the clinic is a good idea,

18:49.780 --> 18:51.695
for the case and for you.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.828
You don't have to be your dad's
glorified secretary anymore.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.873
I'm the vice president
of commun--

18:55.917 --> 18:56.874
you know what?
It doesn't matter.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.528
Whatever, I...

19:00.400 --> 19:02.532
Okay.
I'm gonna go.

19:04.708 --> 19:08.538
Listen, if I lose my job,

19:08.582 --> 19:10.758
I lose everything.

19:10.801 --> 19:11.976
So...

19:13.021 --> 19:15.502
How badly does the laptop
hurt the case?

19:15.545 --> 19:18.461
It's their entire case,
Julia.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.767
What did you think?

19:19.810 --> 19:21.725
I didn't think
it was gonna be this bad.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.684
I mean, sexual assault?

19:23.727 --> 19:26.077
Leon put her
in a terrible position.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.731
If she didn't turn it in,

19:27.775 --> 19:28.863
she would have become
an accomplice.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.517
Well, the damage is done,

19:30.560 --> 19:33.389
so let the professionals
clean it up.

19:33.433 --> 19:36.349
Your panties are literally
in your pocket.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.741
We're married.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.569
I'm aware.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.879
LEON: I didn't keep a record
of everyone, you know?

19:44.922 --> 19:46.446
Just the special patients.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.491
Exceptional people like you.

19:48.535 --> 19:51.886
I mean, I just wanted to see--
marvel, really--

19:51.929 --> 19:55.063
at how amazing you became.
Yeah.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.586
But again, I mean,
it ends up looking

19:56.630 --> 19:59.589
like I'm some kind of creep.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.635
I mean, I--I see how it
can look like that,

20:01.678 --> 20:02.940
you know, to the wrong people.

20:02.984 --> 20:06.379
I knew my material
would work.

20:06.422 --> 20:07.945
It's why I used it
and only until

20:07.989 --> 20:09.947
other technology
made it unnecessary.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.558
But I stopped years ago,

20:11.601 --> 20:13.734
not that anyone
would believe me.

20:13.777 --> 20:14.778
But, uh...

20:17.477 --> 20:18.782
I only wanted to help.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.828
You know, for that,
I'm crucified.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.010
I believe you.

20:29.053 --> 20:31.317
Thank you.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.796
I wish everyone would.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.320
Well, not everyone,
but...

20:34.363 --> 20:35.538
You mean Julia?

20:35.582 --> 20:37.018
I can talk to her.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.367
No, it's okay.

20:38.411 --> 20:41.022
She has every right
to be angry.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.591
Anyway, sorry.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.157
Uh, it's your--it's your roll.
What are we doing?

20:46.201 --> 20:47.637
-Okay.
-Yeah.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.034
We're in discovery.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.950
Right now they have enough
on him for criminal fraud

20:55.993 --> 20:57.691
and malpractice,

20:57.734 --> 21:00.998
but the sexual assault charge
is a huge overreach,

21:01.042 --> 21:02.826
so we're gunning
for dismissal.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.524
What do they have?

21:04.567 --> 21:06.787
It's mostly just based
on his laptop,

21:06.830 --> 21:08.832
showing nefarious intent
by tracking

21:08.876 --> 21:10.007
the children he produced.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.574
CHAD: Well, don't underestimate

21:11.618 --> 21:13.054
a politically motivated
prosecutor

21:13.097 --> 21:14.708
in this current climate, okay?

21:14.751 --> 21:16.666
She could drum up a lot
of public outcry,

21:16.710 --> 21:17.841
get everyone calling
for his head.

21:17.885 --> 21:20.714
I don't intend
to let that happen.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.977
You have a relationship
with Amanda Doherty?

21:24.718 --> 21:26.372
We're friendly.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.982
Take her out for
a couple cosmos,

21:28.025 --> 21:30.201
see if you can suss out
her bottom line.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.725
You might be able
to make a deal with her.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.727
It's a really good idea.
I'll handle it.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.511
CHAD: No, I have a feeling
Edie should do it.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.948
She might have more luck
charming this particular gal.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.876
JULIA: How's my dad?

21:52.920 --> 21:54.661
-Got in, got out?
-ROXY: Yep.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.576
JULIA: 'Cause it's pretty late.

21:56.619 --> 21:59.666
Well,
maybe I had plans after.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.407
I don't think you did.

22:02.538 --> 22:03.887
All right, fine.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.585
I spent the whole time there.

22:06.281 --> 22:07.804
But it was awesome.

22:07.848 --> 22:10.720
I mean, he has my same
weird pinkie toes.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.114
Do you know how cool it is
to see that for the first time?

22:13.157 --> 22:15.072
Oh, and I learned how
to play backgammon.

22:15.116 --> 22:16.987
-Did he take his meds?
-Yeah, he said he did.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.468
So you didn't do the one
thing that I asked you to do?

22:19.512 --> 22:22.123
He said that he took them,
and I believe him.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.430
You know, he's really sad.
He misses you a lot.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.214
He misses what I did for him.

22:26.257 --> 22:30.087
No, he misses you
and how you look up to him

22:30.131 --> 22:31.741
and how you respect him.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.526
He was just trying
to help people

22:33.569 --> 22:35.223
and now he's getting crucified.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.746
Crucified?

22:36.790 --> 22:38.922
Did he tell you to say that?

22:38.966 --> 22:40.489
I think of
my own words to say.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.230
No, that is his word.

22:42.273 --> 22:44.058
I'm sorry but don't
think that he

22:44.101 --> 22:45.538
just automatically likes you.

22:45.581 --> 22:48.715
He's--he's using you
to get to me.

22:48.758 --> 22:50.717
Because it's so impossible
to believe

22:50.760 --> 22:52.632
he might enjoy
spending time with me?

22:54.808 --> 22:57.593
Why do I smell garlic?

22:57.637 --> 22:59.508
-I don't know.
-I definitely smell garlic.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.032
All right, fine.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.991
I--I brought him garlic knots,
and you know what?

23:04.034 --> 23:05.993
-He loved them.
-That's not true.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.298
He hates garlic.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.126
He would never eat
garlic knots.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.606
You just can't stand that you
have a little competition

23:10.650 --> 23:12.608
for your dad's love for once.

23:12.652 --> 23:13.957
That's what's keeping
you up at night.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.568
How do you know
that I'm up at night?

23:15.611 --> 23:17.744
Because, Julia,
I sleep right next to you

23:17.787 --> 23:20.529
and I can hear you tossing
and turning all night.

23:20.573 --> 23:21.835
JULIA:

23:21.878 --> 23:23.271
I'm having nightmares
populated by

23:23.314 --> 23:24.838
who knows how many half
siblings I have

23:24.881 --> 23:25.795
just running around
in the world

23:25.839 --> 23:27.623
waiting to crash into my life.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.843
Maybe I would sleep
a lot better if I had

23:29.886 --> 23:31.148
a pharmacy in my purse.

23:37.024 --> 23:40.549
You know, everything I take
is prescribed by doctors.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.030
And doctors never
do anything wrong?

23:43.073 --> 23:44.727
He was trying to help.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.816
And just think,
if he didn't,

23:46.860 --> 23:49.123
-you wouldn't have me.
-I don't want you!

23:49.166 --> 23:51.038
Here.
I don't want you here.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.648
I want my life back.

23:54.911 --> 23:57.697
All right, well,
you got it.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.263
Okay, I'll go pack my crap.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.149
Ow.

24:17.934 --> 24:21.024
Hands in the air!
We're armed!

24:21.068 --> 24:22.112
Roxy!

24:22.156 --> 24:23.244
Wow, Diane.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.724
If I was a thief
you were gonna attack me

24:24.767 --> 24:26.334
with a gymnastics trophy?

24:26.377 --> 24:28.423
Oh, don't judge your
mother's choices, sweetheart.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.033
Wow, you guys
have made that real hard.

24:30.077 --> 24:32.209
Your hand in that
cookie jar as always.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.646
You and your sweet tooth.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.169
It's where I keep
my extra cash.

24:35.212 --> 24:37.606
Or I used to,
before somebody found it.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.347
That's my extra cash.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.742
Earned from my blood,
sweat, and hamstring tears.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.961
-Where is it?
-Hmm.

24:45.005 --> 24:47.050
No, not unless you come back.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.270
Yeah, come home, sweetie.
We've been worried sick.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.880
I know what you're
worried about, Ron.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.621
It's losing your steady
income stream.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.275
Don't call me Ron.
Don't call--

24:54.318 --> 24:55.929
call me--call me Dad, sweetie.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.887
I would but, you know,
I've, um--

24:57.931 --> 25:00.934
I've met my actual dad now so,
you know, what's the point?

25:00.977 --> 25:02.283
What are you talking about?
You met him?

25:02.326 --> 25:03.763
-Yeah.
-How could you?

25:03.806 --> 25:06.200
He's a--he's a charlatan.
He's a predator.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.463
No, he's not.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.161
He is smart
and he's generous

25:11.205 --> 25:15.775
and he doesn't take half
of everything that I make.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.994
It's like I finally know
what it feels like

25:18.038 --> 25:19.866
to have an actual dad.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.438
-Get out.
-Ron.

25:27.482 --> 25:28.788
-No, get out.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.746
Get out!
Get out of our house!

25:30.790 --> 25:33.270
Go on!
Don't forget your drugs.

25:33.314 --> 25:35.446
And have a good time
with your new dad!

25:35.490 --> 25:37.405
By the way,
he's a felon!

25:44.717 --> 25:46.240
Hi.
Hey.

25:46.283 --> 25:50.070
I, um--I got your message
and it--it sounded urgent.

25:50.113 --> 25:52.376
-Are you okay?
-You left the clinic.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.423
You said you'd be there and you
weren't when I needed you most.

25:55.466 --> 25:58.861
I know.
I'm--I'm so sorry.

25:58.905 --> 26:02.473
I--I, um--I'm a Bechley
and my name is doing

26:02.517 --> 26:04.824
more harm than good right now,
so--

26:04.867 --> 26:06.739
and, you know,
who am I kidding?

26:06.782 --> 26:08.741
You know, I was just my dad's
glorified secretary anyway.

26:08.784 --> 26:13.833
I need to talk to you
because I'm pregnant.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.182
-Oh, my God!
-GRACE:

26:15.225 --> 26:16.966
Really?
Yes!

26:17.010 --> 26:18.968
-I'm pregnant!
-JULIA: Oh, my God!

26:19.012 --> 26:21.101
-We did it!
-No, you did it.

26:21.144 --> 26:23.320
No, when I got the news,
Julia,

26:23.364 --> 26:25.061
the strangest thing happened.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.977
The first person I needed
to tell wasn't my husband

26:28.021 --> 26:30.371
or my mom.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.199
It was you.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.810
From the moment we got
to that clinic,

26:34.854 --> 26:37.508
you were this beacon,
this shining light.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.032
You listened to us.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.729
You made my husband
and me laugh,

26:40.773 --> 26:44.385
even at our most
desperate moment.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.561
You cared.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.781
You never gave up on us.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.957
Your father might be
some sort of genius

26:51.000 --> 26:53.873
but he's not the reason
we chose Bechley.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.092
You are.

26:56.136 --> 26:58.225
You're the heart of that place.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.444
You're no secretary.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.116
Is everything all right?

27:20.160 --> 27:21.857
Yeah.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.946
I tried to talk to Julia
but she's really mad at you,

27:23.990 --> 27:25.295
and now at me, so--

27:25.339 --> 27:28.081
Well, okay,
but are you planning to--

27:28.124 --> 27:29.865
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.040
Okay, hold on.

27:31.084 --> 27:33.260
Edie said that
I'm not allowed to--

27:33.303 --> 27:35.218
Wow, did you collect
all of these?

27:35.262 --> 27:36.872
Like, from around the world?

27:36.916 --> 27:38.613
Uh, no, they're mostly gifts
from patients.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.006
Fertility idols.

27:40.049 --> 27:42.138
Uh, yeah, everyone thinks
they're the first

27:42.182 --> 27:44.227
-to have the idea.

27:44.271 --> 27:45.576
People are idiots.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.796
Well, in my experience, anyway.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.016
You know, I--I planned
to travel, you know,

27:50.059 --> 27:51.234
when I retired.

27:51.278 --> 27:52.932
So many places I wanna see.

27:52.975 --> 27:56.152
You know, but, uh, things
didn't exactly work out,

27:56.196 --> 27:57.937
uh, that way so--
oh, ah.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.113
-Ow.
-Oh, your back?

28:01.984 --> 28:03.420
Yeah, yeah, all the time.

28:03.464 --> 28:04.987
Yeah, it's hyperextension
in your lumbar.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.815
All those double twists
before your spine

28:06.859 --> 28:08.121
is even fully formed.

28:08.164 --> 28:09.470
It never really goes away.

28:09.513 --> 28:10.950
-It just kind of sits there.
-Yeah.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.299
All the time reminding me.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.174
Hey, do you wanna
get out of here?

28:18.218 --> 28:20.394
Because I can take you
on a ride.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.265
I have a sweet Porsche.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.877
I mean, you know, absolutely,
but, you know,

28:24.920 --> 28:27.488
the state, uh, has, uh,
other ideas.

28:27.531 --> 28:29.620
-Oh, I have a hack for that.

28:33.015 --> 28:34.408
Okay.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.366
But I think I should drive.

28:36.410 --> 28:39.239
I know it's premature
to be talking about a deal,

28:39.282 --> 28:42.503
but my client is eager
to get on with his life.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.984
You mean your father?
Your client's your father.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.246
How you doing with
that little nugget?

28:46.289 --> 28:47.900
We're genetically connected.
That's all.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.337
Well, it still must be hard.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.904
A little.

28:54.950 --> 28:58.301
Sometimes I feel like I'm
floating or something.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.391
-I don't--like, thrown.
-Yeah, I do.

29:01.435 --> 29:04.394
I felt that way last week.

29:04.438 --> 29:07.397
You're a good kisser.

29:07.441 --> 29:10.879
Um, I had a lot
to drink that night.

29:10.923 --> 29:14.230
I was upset about things
that were happening

29:14.274 --> 29:17.190
and, uh, we should probably
stick to business.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.932
If you take the assault charges
off the table I--

29:19.975 --> 29:21.977
Nice try.
I'm not reducing the charges.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.239
The evidence doesn't
support it.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.588
Even if it did,

29:24.632 --> 29:26.199
the state gets convictions
in less than 1%

29:26.242 --> 29:27.461
of sexual assault cases.

29:27.504 --> 29:28.505
My track record's
much higher.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.029
Over 90%?

29:30.072 --> 29:32.509
'Cause that's what
you're up against.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.598
You've won 90% of your cases?

29:34.642 --> 29:36.600
87.
I rounded up.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.167
Are all your percentages
that high?

29:38.211 --> 29:39.647
My percentages?

29:39.690 --> 29:42.389
Where do you fall on
the lesbian spectrum?

29:42.432 --> 29:46.045
You're hard to read.

29:46.088 --> 29:48.003
The what?

29:48.047 --> 29:50.266
Am I the first woman
you ever kissed?

29:50.310 --> 29:51.702
We should probably just stick
to talking about the case.

29:51.746 --> 29:54.053
No, no.
No judgment.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.706
When I came out,
someone had to fill me in, too.

29:58.448 --> 30:02.496
A woman's sexuality
is a continuum.

30:02.539 --> 30:06.369
0% gay all the way up to 100%.

30:06.413 --> 30:09.590
Most of us are somewhere
in between.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.244
Where are you?

30:11.287 --> 30:13.376
80/20.

30:13.420 --> 30:16.640
That's pretty specific
for something so unknowable.

30:16.684 --> 30:20.470
I've been at it for a while
so for me it's knowable.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.039
What about you?

30:26.128 --> 30:28.783
50/50.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.654
You know, I bet we can get
that number up.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.439
-One second.

30:32.482 --> 30:35.442
I have to take this.

30:35.485 --> 30:36.965
This is Doherty.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.362
Sorry, it's loud in here.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.451
Whose ankle bracelet went off?

30:44.494 --> 30:46.279
Call me after you get
to his apartment.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.802
Hopefully it was
a malfunction.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.547
Edie, hi.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.375
Your father seems
to have escaped.

30:55.418 --> 30:56.767
Escaped?

30:56.811 --> 30:58.160
I don't know what
he's thinking,

30:58.204 --> 31:00.293
but this judge
does not appreciate

31:00.336 --> 31:02.817
50-year-old white men who think
they're above the law.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.384
You need to figure out
where he would go,

31:04.427 --> 31:06.125
find him,

31:06.168 --> 31:09.345
and bring him back
to his apartment now.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.478
Yeah, he's not really
my problem anymore.

31:13.697 --> 31:14.829
Oh, God.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.096
JULIA: Damn it!

31:22.663 --> 31:24.317
Damn it.
Damn it.

31:27.189 --> 31:29.539
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

31:33.761 --> 31:35.023
You know, we could
have gone anywhere:

31:35.067 --> 31:36.982
The bar,
the casino,

31:37.025 --> 31:39.680
the homes of your enemies.

31:39.723 --> 31:41.551
But your old office is cool,
too.

31:41.595 --> 31:42.944
Yeah, well there's, uh--

31:42.988 --> 31:45.555
there's something
that I needed.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.383
-ROXY: Oh, Julia make that?
-Mm-hmm.

31:47.427 --> 31:49.516
She's, uh, talented.

31:49.559 --> 31:52.127
She was always, uh,
really good with, uh,

31:52.171 --> 31:54.608
-the mixed media.

31:57.654 --> 32:00.570
Well, that, uh, sure seems,
uh, foolish now.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.398
I don't think awards
are foolish.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.706
Feels really good
up on the podium.

32:05.749 --> 32:10.580
It's the, uh, climb down
that's the thing.

32:10.624 --> 32:13.670
It certainly is.

32:13.714 --> 32:16.064
Roxy, you're high.

32:17.631 --> 32:19.415
-No.
-Yeah, you are.

32:19.459 --> 32:20.547
I'm--I'm a doctor.
I can tell.

32:20.590 --> 32:21.591
What'd you take?

32:23.637 --> 32:25.204
Half a Vicie.

32:25.247 --> 32:27.075
Twice.

32:27.119 --> 32:28.381
Mmm.

32:28.424 --> 32:31.514
And how--how often
do you partake?

32:34.256 --> 32:35.692
I don't really wanna
get into this.

32:35.736 --> 32:37.781
No, no, no.
It's--it's okay.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.392
Really.

32:39.435 --> 32:42.221
Um, pretty often.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.789
Pretty much every day.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.443
-Okay.
-It's--

32:47.487 --> 32:49.010
it's not that it stops
the pain

32:49.054 --> 32:51.012
but it stops me
from thinking about it, so...

32:52.753 --> 32:55.016
I'd like to try
to help you with that.

32:55.060 --> 32:57.323
If you want.

32:57.366 --> 32:59.499
Yeah, I want.

33:02.241 --> 33:03.633
Hmm.

33:03.677 --> 33:06.071
JULIA: Hate to interrupt
whatever this is,

33:06.114 --> 33:08.029
but you do realize that
you're currently risking

33:08.073 --> 33:09.248
getting thrown back into jail?

33:09.291 --> 33:10.553
Julia, it's fine.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.642
Roxy had a--a hack.

33:12.686 --> 33:14.340
Then why did I just
get a call from Edie

33:14.383 --> 33:16.037
saying the Department
of Probation

33:16.081 --> 33:17.517
is on their way
to your apartment right now?

33:17.560 --> 33:19.171
ROXY: Oh, snap.
We gotta jet.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.302
Come on.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.179
Your probation officer's
going to be here any second,

33:27.222 --> 33:29.181
so you might wanna get
the ankle bracelet back on now.

33:29.224 --> 33:30.530
Yeah, I--

33:33.185 --> 33:35.143
EDIE: You put it on a vacuum
robot, seriously?

33:35.187 --> 33:36.666
Yeah, registers movement.

33:36.710 --> 33:37.798
Yeah, got it.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.539
LEON: It's actually,
uh, quite clever.

33:39.582 --> 33:42.411
Foot up,
bracelet on now.

33:42.455 --> 33:45.066
-Not smart, guys.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.459
Damn it.
Hurry.

33:46.502 --> 33:47.851
We'll be right there!

33:47.895 --> 33:49.157
You ate garlic knots?

33:49.201 --> 33:50.550
Incredibly delicious.

33:50.593 --> 33:52.247
OFFICER: Department of
Probation; open up now.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.553
ROXY: Okay, let me look it up
on bailhack.com.

33:53.596 --> 33:55.076
Oh, just give me
the damn thing.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.686
We're gonna talk later,
you and me.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.083
Evening.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.693
I got a report of
a possible malfunction

34:03.737 --> 34:05.695
with Mr. Bechley's
ankle bracelet.

34:05.739 --> 34:08.350
Excuse me,
it's Dr. Bechley.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.873
And you can address me.
I'm his attorney.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.180
All right, I need to know
if he did anything

34:12.224 --> 34:13.703
to cause that malfunction.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.575
The only thing malfunctioning
here, officer,

34:15.618 --> 34:17.577
is the criminal justice system.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.709
You shackle my client who,
by the way,

34:19.753 --> 34:21.668
is still innocent
in the eyes of the law

34:21.711 --> 34:23.278
and then you show up
at his home

34:23.322 --> 34:26.455
at this late hour to what?
Harass him?

34:26.499 --> 34:27.848
You can clearly see he's here.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.545
He's been here
the whole time,

34:29.589 --> 34:31.591
so you can take this,
because rest assured,

34:31.634 --> 34:33.201
I will be in
the judge's chambers

34:33.245 --> 34:34.724
first thing tomorrow morning
to have the terms

34:34.768 --> 34:35.725
of his bail modified.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.379
Good evening.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.649
-Very impressive.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.392
Are you sure?

34:50.436 --> 34:51.567
Because I had, like,
three Scotches earlier.

34:51.611 --> 34:53.569
I barely got through that.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.277
How'd you think you were
gonna get away with it?

35:05.320 --> 35:08.758
ROXY: Oh, see, there's a little
sensor on the bottom.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.241
Oh, we're not talking about
the ankle bracelet anymore,

35:13.285 --> 35:14.590
are we?
That's my bad.

35:14.634 --> 35:17.158
It's hard to explain.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.769
You go one day to the next
thinking, uh,

35:19.813 --> 35:22.729
"Tomorrow I'll come clean."

35:22.772 --> 35:25.427
And then, uh, you know,
the years pass

35:25.471 --> 35:28.604
and, uh, tomorrow somehow

35:28.648 --> 35:30.911
doesn't come.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.478
Well, it's tomorrow now,
Dad.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.877
I've been on this case
for three days now,

35:40.921 --> 35:43.793
and you guys are by far
the worst family of any client

35:43.837 --> 35:45.752
I've ever experienced.

35:45.795 --> 35:50.365
No more turning in laptops or
taking Dad on joyrides, please.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.846
Oh, and I read your
employment agreement.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.413
You run the clinic now.

35:56.371 --> 35:58.286
Wait, what?

35:58.330 --> 36:00.767
There's a clause at the end
referring to a succession plan

36:00.810 --> 36:02.464
should Leon become
incapacitated.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.945
-You're in charge.
-Wait.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.164
She's the boss?

36:07.991 --> 36:08.949
EDIE: You're the boss.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.298
I'm the boss?

36:10.342 --> 36:12.387
Oh, Isaac is gonna hate this.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.306
I don't supposed
that you want her.

36:18.350 --> 36:20.961
No, ma'am.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.876
I'll give you a month.
That's it.

36:22.919 --> 36:24.660
-I love you.
-No, you don't.

36:24.704 --> 36:25.966
Can you guys take
this outside?

36:26.009 --> 36:26.967
What do you mean?
It's how I feel.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.490
JULIA: It's not.
It's not.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.492
ROXY: How can you know
how I feel, Julsey?

36:33.843 --> 36:35.845
ISAAC: So let's make sure
that we've contacted

36:35.889 --> 36:37.891
any of the remaining patients
by the end of day Monday.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.632
-ISAAC: Okay?
-JAN: Oh, Julia.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.373
-JULIA: Hi, Jan.
-JAN: Hi.

36:41.416 --> 36:44.332
Hello, everyone.
Isaac, hello.

36:44.376 --> 36:45.942
Uh, do you mind if I sit there?

36:45.986 --> 36:49.772
Julia, you do understand that
part of being terminated

36:49.816 --> 36:51.818
is you don't show up
to the staff meetings, right?

36:51.861 --> 36:54.821
I do, but I'm just gonna
read this real quick.

36:54.864 --> 36:59.608
The bylaws of the Bechley
Institute state,

36:59.652 --> 37:01.784
"In the event
of the incapacitation

37:01.828 --> 37:03.743
or removal of Dr. Leon Bechley,

37:03.786 --> 37:07.355
all operational control
is retained by Julia Bechley,"

37:07.399 --> 37:09.270
which is, um--who
is that again?

37:09.314 --> 37:11.054
-Oh, it's me.
-JAN:

37:11.098 --> 37:14.928
Isaac, you should probably
give her the seat.

37:14.971 --> 37:17.800
I don't know what
a medical facility

37:17.844 --> 37:19.933
expects to do with you
in charge.

37:19.976 --> 37:24.067
You're not a doctor,
but sure.

37:24.111 --> 37:26.722
Go.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.811
You're right.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.073
I'm not a doctor.

37:30.117 --> 37:32.859
Or a genius.

37:32.902 --> 37:35.383
I don't have that arrogance
or that certainty

37:35.427 --> 37:37.298
that comes with thinking
that I'm always right

37:37.342 --> 37:38.386
no matter what I do,

37:38.430 --> 37:40.562
but I do care about people.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.564
I always have.

37:42.608 --> 37:45.872
Probably too much
and too often,

37:45.915 --> 37:48.091
and I know that there's a lot
of people out there

37:48.135 --> 37:49.658
that need to be cared
about right now.

37:49.702 --> 37:53.314
They need answers.
They need support.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.011
Community.

37:55.055 --> 37:57.840
And we could be that place
for them.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.408
Not just for potential
Bechley babies,

38:00.452 --> 38:03.455
but for--for anyone who feels
like their identity

38:03.498 --> 38:05.065
has been torn from them.

38:07.415 --> 38:08.764
You know, anyone like me.

38:08.808 --> 38:11.680
So, that's what
we're going to do.

38:11.724 --> 38:14.335
This is our future.

38:14.379 --> 38:17.991
The new Bechley Institute
starts today.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.824
Oh.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.400
-Nice speech.
-Thank you.

38:35.443 --> 38:37.140
Any idea how to implement it?

38:37.184 --> 38:39.665
Not a clue.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.406
I'm gonna need your help.

38:41.449 --> 38:43.451
We'll do it together.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.148
We'll do it together.

38:45.192 --> 38:48.761
With me as the boss,
but together.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.723
We're still in the process
of identifying

38:54.767 --> 38:56.159
the defendant's
innumerable offspring.

38:56.203 --> 38:57.987
At this point any stranger
on the street

38:58.031 --> 38:59.772
could be a potential witness.

38:59.815 --> 39:01.774
Your Honor, the prosecution
has no reason to believe

39:01.817 --> 39:03.863
that Dr. Bechley would engage
in witness tampering.

39:03.906 --> 39:05.908
He's been fully compliant
with the state--

39:05.952 --> 39:07.388
Despite a report
from the probation office--

39:07.432 --> 39:09.956
That was deemed
a mechanical malfunction.

39:09.999 --> 39:12.959
Dr. Bechley is looking forward
to mounting a vigorous defense

39:13.002 --> 39:14.352
to clear his name.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.441
He's also recovering
from a heart attack.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.834
Restricting him
to his apartment

39:18.878 --> 39:21.315
is excessively punitive
and unnecessary.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.796
And if I were to lift
the house arrest,

39:23.839 --> 39:25.319
who will be responsible
for him?

39:34.067 --> 39:35.068
I will, Your Honor.

39:37.897 --> 39:39.202
And you are?

39:39.246 --> 39:41.727
Uh, Roxy Doyle.

39:41.770 --> 39:44.033
I'm Dr. Bechley's daughter.

39:44.077 --> 39:46.993
JUDGE: Dr. Bechley, you owe
your daughter a big thank-you.

39:47.036 --> 39:50.388
Your house arrest is lifted,
effective immediately.

39:57.307 --> 39:59.309
I have to go to work.

39:59.353 --> 40:01.007
Jules.

40:11.278 --> 40:12.497
AMANDA: Hey.

40:15.456 --> 40:16.414
Hey.

40:22.898 --> 40:25.858
What?

40:25.901 --> 40:29.949
Why are you looking
at me like that?

40:29.992 --> 40:33.822
I think that's the first time
I liked being owned.

40:33.866 --> 40:35.128
In court.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.564
Well, I don't think
I owned you.

40:36.608 --> 40:39.437
I think the judge just
understood the logic

40:39.480 --> 40:42.570
of loosening
the conditions and...

40:42.614 --> 40:44.354
No, keep going.

40:44.398 --> 40:47.880
You were saying something
about loosening conditions.

40:49.577 --> 40:51.449
I may have
underestimated myself.

40:51.492 --> 40:54.190
I have trouble believing you
ever underestimate yourself.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.322
Not in court.

40:55.365 --> 40:59.935
On the, uh--in the, um--

40:59.979 --> 41:01.807
the spectrum thing.

41:07.290 --> 41:08.248
Um...

41:11.164 --> 41:12.905
Maybe I'm a 60/40.

41:12.948 --> 41:16.561
Well, I like the direction
you're trending in.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.045
You okay to head home
on your own?

41:23.089 --> 41:25.439
Yes, thanks.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.136
Uh, she kicked butt in there.

41:27.180 --> 41:29.574
You're a lucky man.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.489
Just stay out of trouble.

41:38.539 --> 41:40.628
You wanted to see me?

41:40.672 --> 41:43.152
I can't let this clinic
that I built

41:43.196 --> 41:44.980
for 32 years be destroyed.

41:45.024 --> 41:47.853
Isaac, you have been my number
two for a very long time.

41:47.896 --> 41:48.941
I need you.

41:48.984 --> 41:49.942
ISAAC: Julia's running things
now,

41:49.985 --> 41:50.943
and you're not allowed to have

41:50.986 --> 41:52.118
anything to do with the clinic.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.119
It's too big of a risk
for you and it's--

41:53.162 --> 41:54.555
I know, yeah.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.426
I have always believed
that you

41:56.470 --> 41:58.211
were gonna be my
true successor.

41:58.254 --> 41:59.560
Mmm.

41:59.604 --> 42:01.519
But we have our work
cut out for us.

42:01.562 --> 42:04.304
Uh, take us to, uh,
Trattoria Buca, please.

42:04.347 --> 42:07.220
Uh, Dr. Bechley, I don't--I
don't think it's the best idea

42:07.263 --> 42:08.613
for us to be seen together
in a restaurant.

42:08.656 --> 42:10.440
LEON: I--I wasn't inviting you
to lunch.

42:10.484 --> 42:12.051
No, just--just for the ride.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.107
Holy...

42:27.066 --> 42:28.546
TIM: Julia.

42:28.589 --> 42:31.200
-Are you okay?
-Tim!

42:31.244 --> 42:34.029
No, I've actually had
a really tough day.

42:34.073 --> 42:35.378
Um, how are you?

42:35.422 --> 42:37.293
Uh, I'm okay,

42:37.337 --> 42:38.556
but I'm a little bit
worried about you.

42:38.599 --> 42:40.558
JULIA: Uh, no, I'm--
I'm a rock.

42:40.601 --> 42:43.430
I can handle anything,
you know, about me.
