01:14.842 --> 01:19.480
I want something that
says I'm sorry he's dead,

01:19.580 --> 01:21.048
but not that sorry.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.616
He was just a dog,

01:22.716 --> 01:25.219
and you shouldn't have
loved him more than me.

01:25.319 --> 01:29.022
Can you do me a bunch
that says that?

01:30.791 --> 01:31.992
Rachel, darling,

01:32.160 --> 01:33.760
tell your father he
can't wear that suit.

01:33.784 --> 01:35.429
He looks nice.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.831
You look nice.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.032
Thank you, puppet.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.501
I've seen better-dressed crab.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.670
I have a question. Oh,
God, would somebody please

01:42.770 --> 01:44.338
put a gag on my daughter?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.274
Why's the alphabet
in that order?

01:46.374 --> 01:47.675
Nobody knows. Nobody cares.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.578
For once in your life
would you just...

01:52.280 --> 01:53.914
What do you think?

01:54.014 --> 01:56.484
Holy wow.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.051
Oh, darling.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.953
You look like meringue.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.656
Good.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.825
You're late.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.327
Balls. What's the job?

02:06.427 --> 02:08.205
Wedding. You always pull.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.062
One of us has to. Nice people?

02:10.198 --> 02:12.466
Haven't met them. All
about the mother.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.367
Isn't it always?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.303
Come out with us first? Sure.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.471
You will? Absolutely.

02:17.571 --> 02:18.672
Oh, cool.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.274
Well, we'll go together.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.942
I'll meet you there.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.211
You're not coming.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.745
My favorite advert's on TV.

02:24.845 --> 02:25.913
You need a love life.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.349
I have a like life.
It suits me fine.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.351
No, I feel good, actually.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.785
Bizarrely good, yeah, yeah.

02:31.885 --> 02:32.786
No nerves at all.

02:32.886 --> 02:33.887
None whatsoever. Thanks.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.022
Thank you very much. Hi.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.290
Thank you. Hi.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.825
You're Hector, right? The groom?

02:37.925 --> 02:39.927
Yeah, yeah, I am. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Call me Heck.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.962
Um, well, I did your flowers.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.764
Oh, did you? Oh, well,
then, then fabulous.

02:43.864 --> 02:44.874
Aren't they, Coop?

02:44.898 --> 02:46.434
Fabulous, yeah.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.403
I wouldn't know a nice flower
from a poke in the eye.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.505
But they're fabulous,
aren't they, Coop?

02:51.605 --> 02:56.577
So, Ned, how long have you
guys been married, then?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.746
30 years. Oh.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.913
If I had killed her

03:00.013 --> 03:01.225
when I first thought about it,

03:01.249 --> 03:02.516
I could be out by now.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.585
A free man.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.388
I remember all the
way to the church,

03:07.488 --> 03:11.124
I just wanted to shout
"Stop the car!"

03:11.259 --> 03:14.362
This is a horrible mistake!"

03:14.462 --> 03:17.698
But I mean, you can't, can you?

03:17.798 --> 03:20.934
So you just sit there,

03:21.034 --> 03:22.135
say nothing,

03:22.270 --> 03:24.772
as the wheels keep turning,

03:24.872 --> 03:26.907
leading you on to the
longest sentence...

03:27.007 --> 03:28.609
Stop the car!

03:28.709 --> 03:29.943
I forgot to pee.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.154
All right, panic over.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.290
They're here now.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.624
Good luck, chum.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.759
All right, is it?
You're all right.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.094
Hi, Heck. Hi, babe.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.562
You want some help with this?

03:48.662 --> 03:49.830
Yes.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.832
I do work out, yes.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.601
I don't have a six-pack.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.402
No?

03:54.502 --> 03:56.670
No, a 12-pack on this puppy.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.639
I don't really like
men with muscles.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.841
The bonus is, though,
I'm very, uh...

04:00.941 --> 04:02.576
I'm very sensitive, too.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.978
Heck, I've got a question.
Not now.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.614
What's the question?

04:06.714 --> 04:08.325
What happens when an
unstoppable force

04:08.349 --> 04:10.318
meets an immovable object?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.021
I haven't got a blasted clue.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.757
There you are, you see? Now we can
let them get married in peace.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.368
Uh, it never happens.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.992
If there's a thing
that can't be stopped,

04:20.016 --> 04:22.062
it's not possible for there
to be something else

04:22.162 --> 04:24.865
which can't be moved,
and vice versa.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.133
They can't both exist.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.378
You see, it's a trick question.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.437
That's the answer.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.839
Can she sit with me?

04:31.939 --> 04:34.342
What am I doing in here?

04:34.442 --> 04:35.909
When do fish sleep?

04:40.648 --> 04:42.149
She's coming, right? Isn't she?

04:42.249 --> 04:44.117
She's coming.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.720
Oh, she is. Yeah.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.823
When, when's she coming?

04:49.923 --> 04:51.191
What's your name, anyway?

04:51.359 --> 04:52.526
Everyone calls me H.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.227
They tell me it's
short for Henrietta,

04:54.362 --> 04:55.529
but it's not.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.498
It's short for Jesus H. Christ.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.766
That's what my mummy said

04:58.866 --> 05:00.586
when she found out she
was pregnant with me.

05:00.610 --> 05:03.070
Isn't Heck handsome?

05:03.170 --> 05:04.638
I fancy that flower girl.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.407
Yeah, yeah, I know you did.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.808
She likes me.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.844
Right? I got, I got a
vibe that she likes me.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.245
Coop, it's my wedding day.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.514
Can we talk about me?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.082
Sure.

05:18.619 --> 05:22.390
Did you get a vibe
that she likes me?

05:27.928 --> 05:29.430
Great.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.899
Last one to the
altar, as they say.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.005
Well, this is it.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.907
Wish me luck.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.475
Wish you luck?

05:41.575 --> 05:42.676
It's a wedding.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.745
Bridesmaids always
pull at weddings.

05:44.845 --> 05:45.846
Wish me luck.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.080
Good luck.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.850
All set.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.755
Okay, you sort it.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.824
I'm going to set
up the reception.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.592
Excuse me.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.265
All good?

06:38.365 --> 06:39.533
Always.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.936
Dearly beloved, we are gathered

06:43.036 --> 06:45.172
here in the sight of God

06:45.272 --> 06:47.675
and in the face of
this congregation...

06:47.775 --> 06:49.342
You look beautiful.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.679
To join together this man

06:51.779 --> 06:55.849
and this woman in
holy matrimony.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.252

11:25.618 --> 11:27.888
now this is a very big deal.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.557
Some say the reason it's taken
him this long to get married,

11:30.657 --> 11:34.361
is his fear of making just this
speech, but he's making it now.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.662
He's not sure he can do it.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.164
I know he can do it.

11:37.264 --> 11:40.500
Please put together
repeatedly, here's... Hecky!

11:48.909 --> 11:52.780
Go on, Hector. Go on.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.293
I know something
that helps, Hector.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.195
Imagine everybody naked.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.502
Hi, everyone.

12:15.602 --> 12:16.636
I'm Heck.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.816
And welcome to my wedding.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.243
So I'm glad you're all
here looking at me,

12:23.343 --> 12:28.858
because, um... because I want to
tell you how much I love Rachel.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.119
What an amazing, wonderful,

12:32.219 --> 12:34.421
uniquely fantastic
person she is.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.129
Do you want to keep going?

12:38.153 --> 12:40.693
No, no. I think
you're doing great.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.964
Uh, okay, so this is me now.

12:44.064 --> 12:49.069
I've been looking forward
to this day all my life,

12:49.169 --> 12:53.140
and... I'm glad to share it
with so many people I love...

12:53.240 --> 12:55.885
and a few people I've
never met before.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.645
But I'm sure you're great, too.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.252
I feel like I've known
Heck all my life,

13:05.352 --> 13:09.289
and I know I'll know him
for the rest of it.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.757
He's my best friend.

13:10.858 --> 13:14.862
They say fairy tales
have happy endings,

13:14.962 --> 13:16.729
even though the
passage can be rough.

13:16.864 --> 13:21.168
But Heck and I were
mates and then lovers,

13:21.268 --> 13:25.873
and it's been
smooth all the way.

13:25.973 --> 13:29.742
Maybe that's a better
kind of fairy tale.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.880
So a toast shmoast
won't do all that,

13:32.980 --> 13:34.500
but if you could all
just wish us luck,

13:34.524 --> 13:36.884
Heck and I would
appreciate it very much.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.651
All righty?

13:38.751 --> 13:41.621
One, two, three.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.590
Good luck!

14:08.448 --> 14:10.383
Hello.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.684
Hi. You've got to help me.

14:11.784 --> 14:12.795
I need a flower.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.321
Just one. A good one!

14:14.421 --> 14:15.655
The best. Okay.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.290
This is my last chance.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.658
My last chance flower.

14:18.758 --> 14:19.768
Your last chance.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.094
I really twated it up.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.930
Only the right
flower can save me.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.664
What about a rose? A red rose.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.533
What would that say? Love.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.676
Love's nice. That works.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.744
And fidelity.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.737
Not a red rose, then.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.397
No, not a rose at all.
It's too obvious.

14:32.421 --> 14:33.974
If this really is
your last chance,

14:34.074 --> 14:37.410
we need to find you
something spectacular.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.955
Be right with you.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.113
That's fine.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.715
Hi.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.017
Hey.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.986
How you doing? Good.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.321
Great. I just...

14:48.421 --> 14:49.722
What's out here?

14:49.822 --> 14:52.559
Came by to say thanks.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.727
It was a total pleasure.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.696
Listen, sorry, I was
just dealing with...

14:56.796 --> 14:58.831
Oh, God, of course.
Go right ahead.

14:58.956 --> 15:00.076
What's your favorite flower?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.011
I don't know.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.836
I think I like lilies.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.638
They're wrong.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.409
How about this?

15:09.509 --> 15:10.543
Bird-of-paradise.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.711
Keep talking.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.113
Real name strelitzia.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.025
Named after Charlotte
of Strelitz.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.884
She married King George
III, had 15 kids.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.586
They never spent more
than an hour apart.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.454
Okay, stop talking.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.890
Do you want to come to dinner?
I'm sorry?

15:23.991 --> 15:27.036
Dinner, with us, Heck and me.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.495
I mean, you don't...

15:28.595 --> 15:29.596
I'd love to.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.731
Really?

15:31.831 --> 15:33.009
This Friday?

15:33.033 --> 15:35.102
Yeah, Friday, why not?

15:35.202 --> 15:36.603
Great. I'll just
write down the...

15:36.703 --> 15:37.704
Perfect!

15:37.804 --> 15:41.108
This is the one.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.076
My last chance flower.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.013
Wish me luck. Good luck.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.916
Next item: lot 48:

15:50.017 --> 15:52.519
a 1930s American
oak mantle clock

15:52.619 --> 15:54.621
here at 48 pounds.

15:54.721 --> 15:55.788
I have 48 pounds.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.066
Fifty.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.192
The lady bid 50.
The lady bid 50.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.693
Okay, baby, now
you've got to glare.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.229
Give out the red eye.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.164
I'd do it, but you're a
lot more frightening.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.699
No, I'm not. Who
am I glaring at?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.068
Anyone who wants that sofa.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.602
They can't have it. It's mine.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.204
Ours. Ours?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.905
If it's under the
limit, 200 pounds.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.307
I didn't know we need a limit.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.476
I like limits. Otherwise,
you'll go mad.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.178
Damn right I will.
That thing is mine.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.579
Ours.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.682
If it's under the limit.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.585
75 pounds? 75?

16:25.685 --> 16:29.098
I invited somebody to dinner,
Friday, that florist, Luce...

16:29.122 --> 16:30.357
Lucy, whatever.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.292
Oh, great, I'll cook.
Please, don't.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.872
Moving right along.
Lot number nine...

16:33.896 --> 16:35.228
Okay, baby, this is us.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.098
This very attractive
leather sofa over there.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.732
Brown leather Chesterfield.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.168
Brass-style decoration

16:41.268 --> 16:43.870
in slightly distressed
condition at 90 pounds.

16:43.970 --> 16:44.970
I asked because...

16:45.072 --> 16:46.339
This is my plan. Oh, no.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.774
I thought we'd get Coop along.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.109
Great idea. Excellent,

16:49.209 --> 16:50.969
but it would be better
if you didn't do that.

16:50.993 --> 16:52.479
90... Do I hear 90 pounds?

16:52.579 --> 16:53.946
Not from us.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.724
Come in late, psyche
them all the way out.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.450
I think they'd be
perfect for each other.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.927
Don't you think
they'd be perfect?

16:58.951 --> 17:00.129
100, 100 pounds?

17:00.153 --> 17:01.821
110, thank you.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.490
Red eye, still the red eye.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.724
Who? Luce and Cooper. I
think they'd be perfect.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.794
120.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.128
130, thank you.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.564
He did say he was on to a
promise at the wedding

17:11.664 --> 17:12.699
before she bailed.

17:12.799 --> 17:13.700
There you go. It's totally on.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.234
150 at the back.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.169
Okay.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.804
Any more? It's funny.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.172
I went round to say thank you

17:19.271 --> 17:20.906
for what she did at our wedding.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.775
Not yet.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.545
You know when you've just met
someone, but straightaway,

17:25.645 --> 17:27.780
you feel as if they're
going to be your friend?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.125
170? 180?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.583
Nearly there.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.128
Who knows why.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.020
Past life, physiognomy.

17:34.121 --> 17:37.624
190? But for some reason,
you just kind of click.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.825
Here we go.

17:38.925 --> 17:39.968
210?

17:39.992 --> 17:42.262
210?

17:42.362 --> 17:44.164
Bollocks. I don't
know what I'm saying,

17:44.264 --> 17:45.832
but do you know what I mean?

17:45.932 --> 17:48.768
Baby, we lost it... the sofa.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.002
What?

17:50.137 --> 17:51.904
210 pounds... Over our limit.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.507
400.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.243
400?

18:10.990 --> 18:12.325
What are you doing?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.170
I live here. What are you doing?

18:14.194 --> 18:16.996
I came to tidy.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.398
You should be dressed, Mum.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.332
Well, I was.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.001
I'm settling in for the evening.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.336
It's 5:00.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.206
You said you were
going out later.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.575
No, you said I was
going out later.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.577
Have you finished work

18:30.677 --> 18:31.878
already?

18:31.978 --> 18:33.021
I'm busy tonight.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.315
Got a date?

18:35.415 --> 18:36.816
Does my daughter have a date?

18:36.916 --> 18:39.018
No,

18:39.186 --> 18:41.721
but you could have.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.061
Oh, tea dances.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.330
Reading groups.

18:50.430 --> 18:54.033
Bridge clubs. Tragic attempts

18:54.201 --> 18:57.337
by lonely old coffin-dodgers
to meet someone

18:57.437 --> 18:59.239
before they give up and peg out.

18:59.339 --> 19:02.409
Everybody looking for love.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.876
Well, they won't find it.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.321
And they certainly
won't get sex.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.979
All those men are so old,

19:07.079 --> 19:08.948
it'd be like playing
snooker with a rope.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.220
You know those people are sad.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.231
You're sad. No.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.923
I'm depressed.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.033
There's a difference.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.860
I wish you'd get a life.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.897
I wish you would.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.634
Yes, I know you do.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.280
Toby, I'm telling you
that's the number!

19:31.304 --> 19:32.505
You've got to believe me.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.374
Oh, come on, Toby. Don't
play that with me.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.075
We're friends.
Aren't we friends?

19:36.243 --> 19:37.510
Well, I like you.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.846
Look, would you believe
it if Heck told you?

19:39.946 --> 19:41.248
You would?

19:41.348 --> 19:43.450
Thank you very much.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.485
Hey, Toby.

19:45.585 --> 19:49.256
Yeah, I know, weird,
but believe him, okay?

19:49.356 --> 19:51.724
Okay, speak soon.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.460
All good.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.363
You see, the truth never fails.

19:56.463 --> 19:59.366
Yeah, except we were lying.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.869
Hmm.

20:05.338 --> 20:09.276
Oh, sorry I'm late,
beautiful person.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.610
You look spectacular.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.178
How was work?

20:12.279 --> 20:14.414
Shite. I'm quitting.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.416
You always say that.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.685
Just watch me. One
day I'll do it.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.888
Tell them I don't like
them or their cash.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.690
Although I do like their cash.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.857
Whatever.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.560
A little something to walk out.

20:27.660 --> 20:31.030
I'll be waiting with champagne.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.433
How much do I wish it
was just us tonight.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.468
He'll definitely be
into her, right?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.304
Coop? He'll fancy Luce.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.838
She's got a pulse, hasn't she?

20:38.938 --> 20:41.140
No, but I mean, you do.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.609
You would?

20:42.709 --> 20:45.177
Well, she's not really my
bag of chips, darling,

20:45.278 --> 20:47.447
but yeah, I suppose.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.849
Oh, what do you think?

20:49.949 --> 20:52.151
Of her? I haven't really.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.120
No, no, the shirt.

20:54.220 --> 20:57.223
Oh, uh, it's gorgeous.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.791
You're gorgeous.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.126
Yeah?

21:00.226 --> 21:02.194
Want to, uh, fool around?

21:02.329 --> 21:04.163
Saved by the bell,

21:04.331 --> 21:07.434
but you're in a lot
of trouble later.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.138
Hey. Hey.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.238
Come in.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.074
You look fab. Thank you.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.175
Guess what I brought.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.320
Bless you.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.210
Rach will flip.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.388
Sweetheart.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.681
Here I am.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.083
Hey. Hi.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.986
So come check out our new sofa.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.154
Our expensive new sofa.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.565
You can't put a
price on comfort.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.358
You see? Woman after
my own heart.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.959
Do you believe in reincarnation?

21:33.059 --> 21:35.099
It's just that Rach thought
you guys had met before.

21:35.123 --> 21:37.897
That's not quite what I...

21:37.997 --> 21:41.133
I'd have remembered, I think.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.445
Well, let's hang these flowers

21:42.469 --> 21:44.036
and get that jacket
in some water.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.872
I'll do it. Ta.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.808
Thanks. Thank you, darling.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.387
So, basically, the book
I've wanted to write

21:51.411 --> 21:53.846
is a guide to wherever
is the coolest place

21:53.946 --> 21:55.515
on the planet at the time.

21:55.615 --> 21:58.284
If it's February, it's
the Rio Carnival,

21:58.385 --> 22:00.987
and if it's, I don't know, May,

22:01.087 --> 22:02.254
it's bulls in Pamplona.

22:02.389 --> 22:05.758
So if you want a holiday/party,

22:05.858 --> 22:07.727
then, uh, you know,
you open the book

22:07.827 --> 22:09.896
and there's me telling
you where to go.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.230
'Cause you've been there?

22:11.398 --> 22:15.101
Yeah, that was the plan,
but, uh, you know...

22:15.201 --> 22:18.270
Rach, life, work.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.006
Rach.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.116
Well, someday.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.475
Yeah, maybe.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.246
Anyway, how about you? Married?

22:27.414 --> 22:29.014
Ever been married?
Ever gonna be married?

22:29.038 --> 22:32.251
Uh, no, no, and maybe now
the laws have changed.

22:32.419 --> 22:33.886
How do you mean? I'm gay.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.025
Hmm.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.292
Lovely.

22:40.427 --> 22:41.528
Well done.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.968
That'll be Cooper.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.670
Cooper's coming?

22:50.770 --> 22:52.972
Yeah.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.112
Mm.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.213
Heck?

23:01.448 --> 23:02.214
Hmm?

23:02.314 --> 23:03.526
This is absolutely revolting.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.851
You think so?

23:04.951 --> 23:06.586
It is, sweetheart.
It's atrocious.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.456
Anyway, more
importantly, listen,

23:09.556 --> 23:11.658
it's been three weeks now.
Let's have it.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.292
How much better is
sex after marriage?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.661
Please.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.629
Because when I've
had sex with people

23:16.729 --> 23:18.130
after they were married,

23:18.230 --> 23:19.590
they have said that
it's fantastic.

23:19.614 --> 23:20.299
Rach?

23:20.467 --> 23:22.334
Get wed and find out yourself.

23:22.469 --> 23:24.149
Cooper couldn't make
that commitment.

23:24.249 --> 23:25.927
We're talking about two or
three years of his life.

23:25.951 --> 23:27.339
I'm not a one-person person.

23:27.474 --> 23:29.274
You really think your
other half is out there?

23:29.298 --> 23:31.544
Or, you know, in here?
Actually, Rach...

23:31.644 --> 23:33.244
What, there's some
gorgeous women around.

23:33.268 --> 23:34.514
Yes, there are.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.549
And I'm trying to sleep
with as many as I can.

23:36.649 --> 23:37.950
And you never fail, do you?

23:38.050 --> 23:41.821
You know they teach the birds
and the bees about me.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.557
It'll all change when
you meet Miss Right.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.602
And how am I suppose to
know when I do that? Hmm?

23:46.626 --> 23:48.828
You don't know,
not straightaway.

23:48.928 --> 23:52.364
It just feels warm

23:52.499 --> 23:53.633
and comfortable

23:53.733 --> 23:55.544
and you hang in there
and give it a chance.

23:55.568 --> 23:56.569
Before you know it,

23:56.669 --> 23:59.872
you're like, yeah, this is it.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.240
Must be love.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.142
Yeah, I'm with you.
I'm with her, too.

24:03.242 --> 24:04.711
Give me that.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.647
I don't agree. I think
you know immediately.

24:07.747 --> 24:11.050
As soon as your eyes...

24:11.150 --> 24:14.020
Then everything that happens
from then on just proves

24:14.120 --> 24:16.656
that you had been right
in that first moment.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.756
When you suddenly realized
you had been incomplete,

24:18.780 --> 24:20.248
and now you are whole.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.930
Actually, I'm with her instead.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.164
I'm with her, too.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.933
Sordid. So who's for pudding?

24:27.033 --> 24:28.434
Yes. No.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.870
No? No, if you think that,

24:30.970 --> 24:32.772
you think that everyone
that doesn't have

24:32.872 --> 24:36.643
all that business is
settling for less...

24:36.743 --> 24:38.277
No, that's not what I'm saying.

24:38.377 --> 24:39.737
That kind of is
what you're saying.

24:39.761 --> 24:41.180
I think she said it a bit nicer.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.584
Trifle?

24:44.684 --> 24:46.418
You look tired, Chief.

24:46.553 --> 24:48.120
You have a good day at work?

24:48.220 --> 24:49.355
Shite. I'm quitting.

24:49.455 --> 24:51.123
Did you check out
flower girl back there?

24:51.223 --> 24:52.725
Made that speech for me.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.827
Later on tonight, we're
going to fall madly in bed.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.629
Oh, it's going well
for you guys, eh?

24:56.729 --> 25:00.567
It's going very well. Hmm.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.201
She's a lesbian.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.705
Is that right?

25:05.805 --> 25:07.439
Cool.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.014
You don't think that
slightly impedes

25:09.038 --> 25:11.210
your plans for seduction?

25:11.310 --> 25:13.580
Anyone can change teams.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.148
Not anyone. I wouldn't,

25:16.248 --> 25:20.119
'cause, well, you know,
but anyone, I mean...

25:30.663 --> 25:32.732
What are you doing?

25:34.300 --> 25:35.935
It's gorgeous!

25:36.035 --> 25:38.004
It's raining.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.408
Heck won't come up here.

25:42.508 --> 25:45.612
They say it's a subconscious
fear you'll throw yourself off,

25:45.712 --> 25:50.116
but he freaks when I
go near the edge, too.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.051
Sorry about dinner.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.054
I've eaten worse.

25:57.456 --> 25:58.991
I kind of went off.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.637
You didn't go off.

26:01.661 --> 26:04.797
Hmm, you went a little way off.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.276
You're wet.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.344
I'm fine.

26:09.368 --> 26:10.378
And you're cold.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.038
I'm fine.

26:12.098 --> 26:14.218
You can have it. Really, you can have it.
I'm so fine.

26:14.242 --> 26:15.341
It's fine. Now you're cold.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.243
Hey, what are you guys up to?

26:17.343 --> 26:18.510
Nothing.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.546
Well, Coop wants to
play strip poker

26:20.647 --> 26:21.781
or strip Cooper,

26:21.881 --> 26:24.183
and I really want
him to go home.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.184
Good night.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.185
See you soon.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.386
One... oh, two.

26:27.486 --> 26:28.387
Thanks for dinner.

26:28.487 --> 26:29.822
Bye.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.960
Cheers, Coop.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.100
Next left.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.145
That's one option, yes.
How about instead,

26:43.169 --> 26:45.404
we just go straight
back to my place?

26:45.504 --> 26:47.206
Coop, take the next left.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.842
You all right, Luce?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.711
Why, because I don't
want to shag you?

26:51.811 --> 26:54.080
You're welcome not to shag me.

26:54.180 --> 26:58.550
Just don't sit in my car
all bored like that. Hmm?

26:58.685 --> 27:02.288
I'm sorry.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.890
Really.

27:03.990 --> 27:08.327
You got something on your
mind; that's obvious.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.763
You know what you should do?

27:10.863 --> 27:13.733
You should share with me.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.535
Because beneath this
rugged exterior

27:16.703 --> 27:19.038
beats a sensitive soul.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.539
No, there doesn't.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.842
No, there doesn't,
but tell me anyway.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.311
It's a girl thing,
though, right?

27:25.411 --> 27:27.313
I mean, it's got to be.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.881
It's a hot and horny scene.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.318
It's you and another
Sagittarian.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.729
Come on.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.254
Tell Uncle Cooper all about it.

27:35.354 --> 27:36.522
Spare me no detail.

27:36.622 --> 27:41.193
Have you ever... met
someone and just...

27:44.130 --> 27:46.098
but they're with
someone else already?

27:46.198 --> 27:47.599
Yeah, sure.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.301
The hot ones are always taken.

27:49.401 --> 27:50.412
So what do you do?

27:50.436 --> 27:51.938
What do I do?

27:54.206 --> 27:55.341
I shag 'em.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.509
The partner is their problem.

27:57.609 --> 27:58.878
It's not mine.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.816
Yeah, I think you don't
mess with other couples.

28:03.916 --> 28:06.652
Don't cause that pain ever.

28:06.753 --> 28:09.621
You just face facts
that it can't happen.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.357
Walk away.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.759
Hook up

28:12.859 --> 28:14.099
with someone available instead.

28:14.123 --> 28:15.762
Well, your place or mine?

28:15.862 --> 28:16.763
Come on, let's.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.865
I'm so good in bed.

28:20.566 --> 28:21.810
So you promise me

28:21.834 --> 28:23.669
the whole matchmaking
thing is over, right?

28:23.770 --> 28:25.604
Last night was a big success.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.039
They left together.

28:27.139 --> 28:30.609
That distant sound you
hear is wedding bells.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.011
Wait, you didn't twig?

28:32.111 --> 28:34.613
Oh, damn, you're so uncool.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.048
What? Twig what?

28:36.148 --> 28:37.760
Well, the thing you
don't know about Luce

28:37.784 --> 28:38.785
is the fact that she's...

28:38.885 --> 28:41.087
Right here. Hey, hey.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.989
Hey, hi. Hello.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.933
Weirdest thing. We were
just talking about you.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.526
Oh, all nice, I hope.

28:47.626 --> 28:50.296
Oh, sorry, Heck. This is Edie.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.697
Edie. Heck.

28:51.798 --> 28:53.065
And Rachel.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.233
Rachel.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.534
Edie.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.636
Luce?

28:57.781 --> 28:58.781
Good.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.406
So, um... Saturday shopping?

29:00.506 --> 29:01.607
Is right.

29:01.808 --> 29:02.809
Great.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.977
Enjoy it, and listen,
thanks for dinner.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.578
We should definitely...

29:06.678 --> 29:07.847
Definitely. We will.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.549
Okay, well, have a
nice rest of shop.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.051
You, too.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.464
So you're going tonight? Because
I was thinking maybe I...

29:16.488 --> 29:17.623
Whoa, pussycat.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.725
What the hell was
going on there?

29:19.826 --> 29:21.327
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.929
Luce is gay.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.365
She's gay?

29:26.465 --> 29:27.876
As a tennis player.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.701
Hey, you recognize
the girlfriend?

29:29.836 --> 29:32.038
She's not just heterosexual.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.974
She's, like, Barbie
heterosexual.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.943
Whoa-whoa, hey! How
are you doing?

29:37.043 --> 29:38.854
We were just talking
about you this time.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.913
We'll be late for kickoff.
Oh, there's hours yet.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.357
We support the same
football team.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.616
Oh, how darling.
Isn't that darling?

29:44.716 --> 29:45.918
Good. Well, hope you win.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.519
Edie, are you gay?

29:47.619 --> 29:48.620
Oh, God.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.523
Am I gay?

29:51.623 --> 29:52.868
I'm ecstatic.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.193
And you two...? No, no.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.363
We're not. I've
tried and I tried,

29:57.463 --> 29:58.497
but she loves another.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.499
Huh. So I'll call you.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.010
Do, 'cause we should definitely.
Definitely.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.235
We will. We're going that way.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.236
Yep, bye again.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.906
Bye.

30:09.008 --> 30:12.244
So I found out they
are not an item.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.813
Yeah, very tactful. Let's pay.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.283
Hi!

30:18.361 --> 30:19.361
Are you stalking us?

30:19.385 --> 30:21.187
And why would we do
a thing like that?

30:21.287 --> 30:23.322
We'll be at this till... Waving.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.466
We'll wave back.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.225
And do. Oh, we must.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.160
Definitely.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.230
Can you hand me the
travel section, then?

31:06.465 --> 31:07.475
Hmm.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.268
I like this jam.

31:10.836 --> 31:13.705
It's really good jam.

31:13.805 --> 31:15.107
I should make jam.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.642
I could make it, you know.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.345
Of course you could.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.513
You don't think I could.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.814
Not for a second.

31:22.949 --> 31:24.960
Anyway, I was talking
to Rob yesterday.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.385
That man's an arse.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.954
That man is an arse.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.755
But he's got this really
sweet girlfriend.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.324
God knows what she's found to
love about him, but she does.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.961
And he cheats on
her like a nutter.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.429
Oh, come back to bed.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.298
I'm up now.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.532
Does she know?

31:40.632 --> 31:43.235
Well, I'm like, "If you
want to leave, tell her."

31:44.803 --> 31:46.405
Are you really up?

31:46.505 --> 31:48.174
I really am.

31:48.274 --> 31:51.410
Maybe he doesn't want to leave.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.179
Maybe he doesn't
know what he wants.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.681
Anyway, he should figure it
out before someone gets hurt.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.986
Why are you looking at me?

32:00.086 --> 32:03.689
Because you're the person.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.157
You wait till I make jam.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.060
That'll rock your world.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.529
What about a bit
more color in there?

32:10.629 --> 32:11.763
I've got some lovely lilac.

32:11.863 --> 32:14.133
Oh, why not?

32:14.233 --> 32:17.003
They're, uh, for my boyfriend.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.038
I'm going to tell him
we're having a baby.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.306
That's great.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.274
I think so.

32:22.374 --> 32:25.111
Uh... He will too.
He definitely will.

32:25.211 --> 32:27.279
He's a bit of a control freak.

32:27.379 --> 32:32.318
I'm surprised he doesn't
wear the diaphragm.

32:32.418 --> 32:33.752
He's, uh...

32:33.852 --> 32:35.721
He's gonna hate me.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.926
He's gonna hate me.

32:42.328 --> 32:46.074
I-I-I love him so much!

32:46.098 --> 32:47.109
Yeah, I'm surprised.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.176
He sounds wonderful.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.902
I-I didn't I, I...

32:52.204 --> 32:53.872
Um, I should...
Tell me what to do.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.741
Whatever it is...
Just let me, um...

32:58.044 --> 33:00.079
Flowered Up.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.381
Yes, I can do a delivery.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.683
Right now? No, it's no problem.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.418
Hi.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.720
I was told to deliver
these to table 7?

33:08.820 --> 33:11.257
Oh, certainly. It's
through there.

33:23.635 --> 33:24.646
Cute, huh?

33:24.670 --> 33:26.672
Very cute.

33:26.772 --> 33:27.806
Fuck me if I'm wrong,

33:27.906 --> 33:29.608
but I think you want to kiss me.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.178
Coop, you and me.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.513
It's not going to happen.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.215
It's not?

33:37.649 --> 33:38.950
I'll be your friend.

33:39.085 --> 33:41.253
Well, that'll do.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.257
For now.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.265
Really?

33:53.365 --> 33:54.833
My daughter's school
presentation?

33:54.933 --> 33:57.369
You should have let
them get T-shirts made.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.147
It's not really
that kind of deal.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.372
Probably a blessing.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.174
Your father doesn't
have the body for them.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.942
Of course, I'm just
speaking from memory.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.144
Hi.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.764
Lucy, darling, what
are you doing here?

34:06.788 --> 34:09.181
I helped H with her, um,
well, she invited me.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.350
Henrietta is ready to start now.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.119
This is space.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.654
Space is many light-years away.

34:15.754 --> 34:19.824
Light-years are not made in days
or months, but in kilometers.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.793
There is a good reason for this,

34:21.893 --> 34:23.995
but I don't quite
understand it yet.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.831
This picture is the Milky Way.

34:26.931 --> 34:28.300
It's made up of lots of stars

34:28.400 --> 34:31.469
and there's a
celestial phenoma...

34:31.570 --> 34:33.639
phe-nom-enon.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.409
One of the best constellations
is Ursus Major, which is

34:38.510 --> 34:40.746
Latin American for "Big Bear."

34:40.846 --> 34:42.547
It's called that because one day

34:42.648 --> 34:45.193
in the olden times that
never really happened,

34:45.217 --> 34:46.685
a naughty god called Zeus

34:46.784 --> 34:49.155
wanted to go to bed with
someone he wasn't married to.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.322
His wife was about
to catch him...

35:10.276 --> 35:12.744
and that's everything you
need to know about space.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.688
So, good.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.022
Very good.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.192
You have to go, right?

35:26.292 --> 35:27.559
Um... but I don't.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.661
I'm okay.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.298
Luce, I, uh...

35:36.101 --> 35:37.101
I think that we should

35:37.203 --> 35:39.838
talk about something.

35:39.938 --> 35:42.274
It's just, I don't know.

35:42.334 --> 35:44.014
When I'm with... Yeah,
uh, I do have to go.

35:44.038 --> 35:45.644
Oh. Actually, I just realized

35:45.744 --> 35:47.746
I've, um, got a delivery.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.115
Oh, yeah, right.

35:50.216 --> 35:52.451
You go.

35:52.551 --> 35:53.852
Yeah.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.324
Listen to this.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.568
"In her acceptance speech,
the distinguished scientist

36:00.592 --> 36:03.495
"paid tribute to her husband, Dr.
Chris Davis." Spelt wrong.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.265
"Tomorrow the pair celebrate
their 42nd wedding anniversary

36:06.365 --> 36:08.667
"after eloping together
on the day they met.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.567
"When asked how they could
possibly have known

36:10.667 --> 36:12.427
"it would all work out,
Professor Harrison...

36:12.451 --> 36:16.308
professor... "replied in
true scientific fashion",

36:16.408 --> 36:18.377
"'You don't know. You
can never be sure.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.812
"'But you take the
plunge anyway.

36:20.912 --> 36:23.315
'Sure works for people
who don't love enough.'"

36:23.415 --> 36:25.651
Oh... Oh...

36:25.751 --> 36:27.853
Do you guys believe in
love at first sight?

36:27.953 --> 36:30.256
Well, it saves time.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.360
No, really, that you could

36:34.460 --> 36:39.064
meet someone, or just...
cross a room,

36:39.164 --> 36:40.532
and with that one glance

36:40.632 --> 36:43.335
you could look in their
eyes and see their soul.

36:43.435 --> 36:47.373
Do you believe
that could happen?

36:47.473 --> 36:48.707
No.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.576
Absolutely not.

36:52.110 --> 36:53.645
No, me, neither.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.329
These are due back Thursday.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.489
If we're closed, just put
them through the door.

37:03.589 --> 37:04.290
Enjoy.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.624
Thanks a lot.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.326
Thanks.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.995
Hi. These, please.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.813
And this as well.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.196
It's just...

37:35.220 --> 37:36.988
It's for research.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.425
Call it what you want, darling.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.336
It's actually out.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.228
Oh, that's okay. It
doesn't interest...

37:43.329 --> 37:45.089
Although it's due back.
I'll give him a call.

37:45.113 --> 37:46.173
Oh, no, honestly.

37:46.197 --> 37:47.433
Hey, trust me:

37:47.533 --> 37:49.234
this one you want to see.

37:49.335 --> 37:51.370
Hello, Cass?

37:51.470 --> 37:53.038
Yes, Terri from the vid shop.

37:54.039 --> 37:55.641
I thought it was you.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.409
Mum!

37:57.509 --> 37:59.578
I was just dropping by
with the wedding snaps.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.947
Oh, I tell you, that
photographer should be sacked.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.349
He made me look like a thug.

38:03.449 --> 38:04.983
A thug in lilac.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.084
Anything good?

38:06.184 --> 38:08.387
N-no. N-no.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.389
There's a lady here
needs your copy

38:10.489 --> 38:11.499
of Georgie's Bush.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.892
Georgie's Bush?

38:13.992 --> 38:15.727
It's for research.

38:15.827 --> 38:16.828
Oh.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.163
It's for Heck.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.632
He's very interested
in American politics.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.100
She's bringing it 'round.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.835
Well, I call that very sexy.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.171
Hmm?

38:26.271 --> 38:29.575
I wouldn't kick him out of bed
for eating crackers, would you?

38:32.678 --> 38:34.158
Oh, Georgie! Oh...

38:34.182 --> 38:35.747
Call me Mrs. Prejudice.

38:37.282 --> 38:38.617
Babe, are you home?

38:38.717 --> 38:40.852
"You have won a share
of one million pounds."

38:43.389 --> 38:45.090
Oh, you are home.

38:45.190 --> 38:46.892
Hi! Oh, God.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.828
Am I glad to see you.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.463
The morning I've had,

38:51.563 --> 38:53.865
I just had to get
away, you know?

38:55.901 --> 38:56.944
Shall I burn some lunch?

38:56.968 --> 38:59.037
Please.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.305
Hey, you got some vids.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.774
Yeah, don't bother looking.
I just got...

39:02.874 --> 39:03.775
This one's great.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.711
This one got pans, but whatever.

39:07.913 --> 39:10.849
And here's one that I
haven't seen before.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.884
Which? Are you... um...?

39:14.019 --> 39:15.463
Oh...

39:15.487 --> 39:17.756
They gave me the wrong one.

39:17.856 --> 39:18.590
Oh, my God. That...

39:18.690 --> 39:21.026
The woman at the video store.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.028
I'll take it back.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.063
Yeah, take it back. Yeah,
that's excellent, yeah.

39:25.163 --> 39:26.465
I mean, what, it's porn?

39:26.565 --> 39:28.467
Right? It's degrading.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.478
It's offensive. God, yes.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.903
Yeah. Let's watch it anyway.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.939
Come on, Rach, I mean,
things have been getting

39:34.039 --> 39:36.842
a big slack in that
department recently.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.210
I know it's my fault and it's all...
Yeah.

39:39.310 --> 39:41.447
No, it's mine. I, um...

39:41.547 --> 39:43.882
But I don't want to watch this.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.250
Why?

39:45.350 --> 39:46.885
It doesn't turn me on.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.059
Well, that's one of us.

40:02.834 --> 40:06.204
I love the smell of hot
dog in the evening.

40:06.304 --> 40:09.675
It smells like...

40:09.775 --> 40:11.209
hot dog.

40:11.309 --> 40:12.578
Yeah.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.880
Thing is, Ned, what I
wanted to ask was...

40:14.980 --> 40:16.515
Um, turkey.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.850
I was just wondering if
it was just a bit odd,

40:18.950 --> 40:21.219
for you guys, you know,
after you got married...

40:21.319 --> 40:25.056
if, uh, the interplay
between you two

40:25.156 --> 40:27.358
got a bit... clutchy.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.359
Some onions?

40:28.460 --> 40:30.161
No. Thanks.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.439
Because, what I'm finding...

40:31.463 --> 40:32.631
Mustard? Ketchup?

40:32.731 --> 40:36.468
I'm trying to talk to you here.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.236
Oh, what about, dear boy?

40:38.336 --> 40:41.006
Why, i-it's just,
I'm just, well...

40:41.106 --> 40:43.475
I'm finding it a bit tricky
at the moment with Rachel.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.877
Oh, God, you mustn't discuss her with me.
Never do that.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.713
Sorry? Well, that's
our problem, you see.

40:47.813 --> 40:51.850
The two of us, we could be
most pleasant to each other,

40:51.950 --> 40:54.786
talk of sport or weather
till our throats hurt.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.054
Yeah. Yeah.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.723
Never mention relations.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.758
As soon as you do, the
only concrete thought

40:59.858 --> 41:01.627
running through my mind is...

41:01.727 --> 41:05.163
that hound is putting
it up my daughter.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.537
Rach!

41:21.847 --> 41:24.015
Darling, I don't know what
to do about your father.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.316
He's never been

41:25.416 --> 41:26.685
the last of the red-hot lovers

41:26.785 --> 41:28.419
but, recently, it's
got to the point

41:28.554 --> 41:30.565
where he's jealous
of a stiff wind.

41:30.589 --> 41:31.990
Hey, you guys.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.124
Thank God you're here.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.259
You have no idea.

41:34.359 --> 41:35.661
Good. I've got you both.

41:35.761 --> 41:37.929
Now, how are my
grandchildren coming along?

41:38.029 --> 41:39.698
Could you get me away
from her, please?

41:39.798 --> 41:41.032
Just hinting, darling.

41:41.132 --> 41:42.568
One wants to have them

41:42.668 --> 41:45.571
while one's still young
enough to pick them up.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.907
Ooh!

41:54.079 --> 41:57.592
What I do with your parents
is remind myself that,

41:57.616 --> 42:00.218
if it wasn't for them,
I wouldn't have you.

42:09.595 --> 42:11.162
What's up, baby?

42:12.363 --> 42:13.899
Let's go home.

42:13.999 --> 42:17.645
Now, remember, try not to look
like you're my child, okay?

42:17.669 --> 42:19.204
Because it... it...
it puts men off.

42:19.304 --> 42:20.438
But keep you eyes peeled,

42:20.606 --> 42:22.440
and, if you spot
anyone you think,

42:22.608 --> 42:24.175
you know, well, he looks nice...

42:24.275 --> 42:25.611
Hi. Luce!

42:25.711 --> 42:27.478
Hey! Hey! How you doing?

42:27.613 --> 42:29.147
This is my friend Beth.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.658
She's on the roam.

42:30.682 --> 42:32.618
Now you found a friend.
Can I go home?

42:32.718 --> 42:34.986
No. I'm trying to
find her a man.

42:35.086 --> 42:37.222
There aren't any. Trust me.
I've looked.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.489
Oh, careful!

42:38.624 --> 42:39.658
Sorry, Missus.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.693
Don't call me Missus.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.330
Hello.

42:45.430 --> 42:47.833
All right.

42:54.472 --> 42:57.042
Brilliant.

42:57.142 --> 42:59.811
You've got a boyfriend.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.689
You've got a boyfriend.

43:01.713 --> 43:04.515
No, I haven't. Not yet.

43:04.650 --> 43:08.286
I can't wait till you
get a boyfriend.

43:08.386 --> 43:10.221
You probably can, actually.

43:10.321 --> 43:11.923
You could even get a husband.

43:12.023 --> 43:13.959
You're old enough, and
I don't like Heck.

43:14.059 --> 43:17.495
H, I should explain
something to you.

43:17.663 --> 43:21.399
I do believe I will be with one
person for the rest of my life,

43:21.499 --> 43:24.269
but that person will be a woman.

43:24.369 --> 43:26.204
I understand.

43:26.304 --> 43:27.673
You do?

43:27.773 --> 43:30.141
My best friend is
Natalie Curtis.

43:30.241 --> 43:33.278
I'd rather spend the rest of
my life with her than any boy.

43:33.378 --> 43:36.214
There you go.

43:36.314 --> 43:39.250
It doesn't mean you're
a lesbian or anything.

43:39.350 --> 43:41.920
Come on! Let's go!

43:46.692 --> 43:48.426
I'll put the kettle on, babe.

43:48.526 --> 43:50.228
I'll have a beer instead.

43:50.328 --> 43:52.097
Really?

43:53.198 --> 43:55.233
I was going to ask
you, but, um...

43:55.333 --> 43:56.401
But what?

43:57.736 --> 43:59.237
Rach, are you pregnant?

44:03.474 --> 44:04.976
No. No, I'm not. No.

44:05.076 --> 44:08.346
I just thought it might
explain your recent...

44:10.248 --> 44:11.482
whatever.

44:11.582 --> 44:12.984
It doesn't matter.

44:17.823 --> 44:19.424
Unless, um...

44:20.726 --> 44:22.327
Unless what?

44:25.230 --> 44:28.599
Umm... Do you want
to get pregnant?

44:28.734 --> 44:31.779
You and my mum.

44:31.803 --> 44:34.239
Listen, I know we said
we were going to wait,

44:34.339 --> 44:36.007
but until what?

44:36.107 --> 44:38.910
We're even more settled?

44:39.010 --> 44:40.378
Come on. What do you think?

44:48.820 --> 44:50.756
I've got to take it.

44:51.589 --> 44:54.459
Rob, hey, what's up?

44:54.559 --> 44:55.994
No. I'm good, man.

44:56.094 --> 44:58.263
Yeah, yeah, they're
in my briefcase.

44:58.363 --> 44:59.397
Hang on.

45:16.581 --> 45:18.283
Hello.

45:20.451 --> 45:22.220
Hello?

45:27.625 --> 45:30.838
Hey, gorgeous. That was Rob.

45:30.862 --> 45:34.099
Look, I'm really sorry
about this, but, um...

45:36.935 --> 45:38.669
Of course you should still go.

45:38.804 --> 45:40.244
I wouldn't put you
through my evening

45:40.268 --> 45:42.340
for all the coke in Colombia.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.040
You know, there'll be
the usual bollocks;

45:44.064 --> 45:45.119
everyone will get pissed.

45:45.143 --> 45:46.587
I'll get pissed...

45:46.611 --> 45:49.280
and start singing country
and Western songs badly,

45:49.380 --> 45:50.548
like I always do.

45:50.648 --> 45:51.658
Hello.

45:51.682 --> 45:54.485
Heck. It's Luce.

45:54.585 --> 45:55.954
Hey, Luce. How's it going?

45:56.054 --> 45:58.156
It's Luce. What's up?

45:58.256 --> 46:01.059
Nothing. My phone
just rang, and...

46:01.159 --> 46:03.594
Say, are you busy Tuesday night?

46:03.694 --> 46:05.931
Do you mind escorting
my wife somewhere?

46:06.031 --> 46:07.431
It's just, like,
I've got this wanky

46:07.455 --> 46:08.834
bug thing which I
can't get out of,

46:08.934 --> 46:10.268
and it would be really great

46:10.368 --> 46:12.703
if you'd look after Rach for me?
Go on, say yes.

46:12.838 --> 46:14.305
Go on. Then, yes.

46:14.405 --> 46:15.850
Brilliant. Brilliant.

46:15.874 --> 46:18.709
Well, Rach will ring
you with the details

46:18.844 --> 46:21.579
and, um... be safe.

46:21.679 --> 46:23.481
You, too.

46:25.884 --> 46:28.186
You shouldn't have done that.
I hardly know her.

46:28.286 --> 46:31.589
But she's your "soul mate
for life" -type, then.

46:31.689 --> 46:34.860
Never belt her. Beer.

46:38.096 --> 46:39.907
Does she know where we're going?

46:39.931 --> 46:44.302
Go on. Hurt him! Hurt his legs!
Chop him!

46:45.370 --> 46:46.571
Oh, my God!

46:46.671 --> 46:49.040
That was offsides!

46:49.140 --> 46:51.342
You know, you're kind of shrill.

46:51.442 --> 46:52.777
What?

46:52.878 --> 46:54.012
When you shout.

46:54.112 --> 46:56.347
You want them to hear
your abuse better,

46:56.447 --> 46:58.893
you've got to project it.

46:58.917 --> 47:00.151
Teach me.

47:00.251 --> 47:03.554
Okay. First off, tighten
your stomach muscles.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.490
I don't think I've got any.

47:05.590 --> 47:07.625
Yeah, you do. You really do.

47:07.725 --> 47:08.936
They're right here.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.361
There? Uh-huh.

47:10.461 --> 47:12.230
Tighten. Tighten.

47:12.330 --> 47:13.498
Tense them.

47:13.598 --> 47:14.765
They're pretty tense.

47:14.900 --> 47:16.911
Okay. Next, broaden
your diaphragm.

47:16.935 --> 47:18.369
My what?

47:19.604 --> 47:20.638
It's here.

47:20.738 --> 47:22.507
Oh.

47:22.607 --> 47:25.210
Okay, push it out
against my hand.

47:26.311 --> 47:28.646
You feel my hand?

47:28.746 --> 47:32.450
Maybe if you put
them both there.

47:38.089 --> 47:43.161
Okay, and now for the big one.

47:43.261 --> 47:47.132
Imagine the roof of your
mouth as a cathedral.

47:48.299 --> 47:50.335
No. You've lost me. Come on.

47:50.435 --> 47:52.737
No. The muscles, the diaphragm...
I'm there, but...

47:52.837 --> 47:53.939
It's a space thing.

47:54.039 --> 47:55.382
All right? Your
mouth is that big

47:55.406 --> 47:57.608
that you have to
fill it with sound,

47:57.708 --> 47:59.945
deep from inside,
filling the space,

48:00.045 --> 48:01.712
then throwing it out.

48:01.812 --> 48:03.991
Like how?

48:04.015 --> 48:07.652
Uh... like this.

48:07.752 --> 48:11.957
You're a wanker, number nine!

48:14.592 --> 48:15.826
That's not bad, is it?

48:15.961 --> 48:17.963
No.

48:19.197 --> 48:21.499
All right, so your turn.

48:21.599 --> 48:22.700
Where do you want to go?

48:22.800 --> 48:24.102
I don't care where we go.

48:24.202 --> 48:28.039
Good. I'll decide again.

48:28.139 --> 48:29.640
I feel like dancing.

48:29.740 --> 48:33.211
Boom! Hold that thought.

48:33.311 --> 48:35.613
What? What, you know
somewhere we should go?

48:35.713 --> 48:37.024
I've got an idea.

48:37.048 --> 48:40.018
Let's begin to dancing.

48:42.587 --> 48:43.989
♪ My head is in a spin

48:44.089 --> 48:46.124
♪ My feet don't
touch the ground ♪

48:46.224 --> 48:48.126

49:08.413 --> 49:11.216

49:24.029 --> 49:26.331
♪ It feels like I'm in love.

49:26.431 --> 49:27.598
You guys rule!

49:27.698 --> 49:29.834
All right, more.

49:29.934 --> 49:32.037
Um, tell me about the lily.

49:32.137 --> 49:34.105
You don't want to
know about the lily.

49:34.205 --> 49:36.041
It's my favorite.

49:37.908 --> 49:41.046
Ask me about the azalea.

49:41.146 --> 49:43.448
All right.

49:43.548 --> 49:45.216
What about the azalea?

49:45.316 --> 49:48.253
The azalea means "may you
achieve financial security."

49:48.353 --> 49:49.720
Ugh!

49:49.820 --> 49:50.864
See?

49:52.523 --> 49:53.791
Lovely.

49:53.891 --> 49:56.061
Now tell me about the lily.

49:57.628 --> 50:00.598
The lily means...

50:00.698 --> 50:03.668
The lily means "I
dare you to love me."

50:11.076 --> 50:13.278
Well, thanks for this evening.

50:13.378 --> 50:14.779
Thank you.

50:14.879 --> 50:16.914
It was my birthday.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.783
No! Today? Mm.

50:18.883 --> 50:20.818
You should have said.

50:20.918 --> 50:22.553
It's mine coming up.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.389
We're practically twins.

50:26.624 --> 50:28.793
This is me.

50:35.066 --> 50:37.868
Okay, good night.

50:37.968 --> 50:39.970
Yeah.

50:40.071 --> 50:42.107
Good night.

51:00.691 --> 51:03.994
Hmm, your feet.

51:04.129 --> 51:06.231
Are they cold?

51:06.331 --> 51:08.133
No, they're stinking.

51:10.335 --> 51:12.002
Yes, of course, cold.

51:12.137 --> 51:14.505
Mm. Come here.

51:25.049 --> 51:27.017
You fancy coming around tonight,

51:27.152 --> 51:29.154
or are you too married?

51:29.254 --> 51:31.389
Hmm. Actually, Rach wants
to take me to dinner.

51:31.489 --> 51:34.492
Just fill me up, and wants
to take me to dinner,

51:34.592 --> 51:35.826
which is sweet.

51:35.926 --> 51:36.970
Mm, very sweet.

51:36.994 --> 51:38.004
Yeah.

51:38.028 --> 51:39.330
Blow her off.

51:39.430 --> 51:40.831
Come around mine
for pizza, really.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.434
No, I want you to meet the
Italian girl that delivers it.

51:43.534 --> 51:44.935
What about that
flower girl, Luce?

51:45.035 --> 51:46.537
I thought you had plans there.

51:46.637 --> 51:48.757
Hmm. There's another one that
won't let me get it wet.

51:48.781 --> 51:49.783
She's gay.

51:49.807 --> 51:51.176
I'm a cure for lesbianism.

51:51.276 --> 51:52.710
No, you're a deeply shallow man.

51:52.810 --> 51:54.044
Yes, I am. Hmm.

51:54.179 --> 51:55.446
When's it going to stop?

51:55.546 --> 51:57.047
Never, I hope.

51:57.182 --> 51:58.816
God bless you.

52:00.251 --> 52:02.253
Hmm, really, though.

52:02.353 --> 52:03.588
I mean, I'm 29 years old.

52:03.688 --> 52:05.590
You're 31. Precisely my point.

52:05.690 --> 52:06.824
I'm getting older.

52:08.693 --> 52:10.461
And I see you...

52:10.561 --> 52:12.497
I see what you've got with...

52:14.031 --> 52:16.801
And see that stability

52:16.901 --> 52:19.837
and the trust, the permanence...

52:21.206 --> 52:23.208
And I think,

52:23.308 --> 52:26.444
God, I'm glad I'm not you.

52:26.544 --> 52:30.080
And she thinks I feel totally
100% stable at the moment.

52:30.215 --> 52:31.982
You got trouble in paradise?

52:32.082 --> 52:33.851
No, no, no.

52:33.951 --> 52:37.488
How could there be? We
only just got married.

52:37.588 --> 52:39.023
Milly! Milly, darling!

52:39.123 --> 52:40.603
I mean, it's always,
always, isn't it?

52:40.627 --> 52:41.259
Sorry...

52:41.359 --> 52:42.360
That's okay...

52:42.460 --> 52:43.861
Okay? Don't move.

52:43.961 --> 52:45.563
What?

52:45.663 --> 52:48.966
I notice a-a girl back there
that I never called back.

52:49.066 --> 52:51.269
Just stay perfectly still, okay?

52:51.369 --> 52:53.271
We'll get through this.

53:00.811 --> 53:02.847
Did you ever...

53:02.947 --> 53:05.149
you know, cross the street?

53:05.250 --> 53:07.017
Back to Patty's?

53:07.117 --> 53:08.386
And what?

53:08.486 --> 53:11.121
And what the hell are
you talking about?

53:11.256 --> 53:12.790
Drink after work tonight?

53:12.890 --> 53:14.124
Dinner with Heck.

53:14.259 --> 53:17.304
I mean, did you ever,

53:17.328 --> 53:19.430
fancy or think you might have...

53:19.530 --> 53:23.601
Briefly, before you realized you didn't...
another... woman?

53:23.701 --> 53:25.169
Why?

53:25.270 --> 53:27.472
I'm trying to find
someone for Beth,

53:27.572 --> 53:29.574
and I thought I'd
double my chances.

53:30.908 --> 53:33.678
Already tried it,
didn't happen for me.

53:33.778 --> 53:34.979
I like men.

53:35.079 --> 53:37.615
I mean, I hate
men, but you know.

53:37.715 --> 53:40.327
Oh, I always hoped to do a woman

53:40.351 --> 53:41.952
before I died, but
it's kind of like,

53:42.052 --> 53:43.821
I want to go to Norway sometime.

53:43.921 --> 53:45.155
Do you know what I mean?

53:45.290 --> 53:46.757
Probably never gonna happen.

53:49.093 --> 53:50.828
Is Heck taking you to dinner?

53:50.928 --> 53:51.996
I'm taking him.

53:53.631 --> 53:55.666
How perfect.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.677
That was fun.

54:06.777 --> 54:09.179
Wasn't it fun?

54:09.314 --> 54:11.582
I had a good time.

54:13.017 --> 54:14.685
You know, Rach, I think maybe...

54:14.785 --> 54:16.321
Hey, the Heath...

54:16.421 --> 54:18.501
Do you remember that night
you took me in the bushes?

54:18.525 --> 54:19.857
I never took you in the bushes.

54:19.957 --> 54:21.492
Sorry. Wrong guy.

54:21.592 --> 54:22.960
I took you up against the tree.

54:23.060 --> 54:24.338
Can't be dealing with bushes,

54:24.362 --> 54:26.340
nettles and deadly nightshade.

54:26.364 --> 54:27.498
Let's do it.

54:27.598 --> 54:28.399
What?

54:28.499 --> 54:29.834
Let's go. Let's do it now.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.345
No.

54:31.369 --> 54:34.339
Rach, no.

54:35.973 --> 54:38.385
Rach?

54:38.409 --> 54:40.678
Rach, where are you?

54:40.778 --> 54:42.780
Come on, darling.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.982
Rachel!

54:45.082 --> 54:46.417
I just, I just don't understand

54:46.517 --> 54:48.429
why we have to do this
stuff anymore, you know?

54:48.453 --> 54:49.887
We've got a flat.

54:49.987 --> 54:51.689
It's a good one!

54:51.789 --> 54:53.334
And I've confiscated
your mother's keys

54:53.358 --> 54:54.792
so she can't sneak
up on us anymore

54:54.892 --> 54:57.595
and I swear that woman's
got a sex radar.

54:57.695 --> 54:59.129
We've got a bed! You know, warm;

54:59.229 --> 55:00.765
it's welcoming; it smells nice;

55:00.865 --> 55:02.905
and it's a damn sight better
than this arsing place.

55:02.929 --> 55:04.902
Ah! Jesus Christ!

55:05.002 --> 55:06.437
Let's go.

55:06.537 --> 55:09.106
No, nettles everywhere.
What are you doing?

55:09.206 --> 55:10.541
Taking off your clothes.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.610
That's one of the good
things about being a man.

55:12.710 --> 55:13.711
Hmm?

55:13.811 --> 55:15.221
You can do these things
without stripping off.

55:15.245 --> 55:16.923
Just a zip, a simple
zip, is all you need.

55:16.947 --> 55:19.393
Give it a yank, and you're
well away, darling.

55:19.417 --> 55:21.519
Are you going to talk
all through this?

55:21.619 --> 55:23.788
Did I mention we have a bed?

55:26.757 --> 55:28.025
What was that?

55:28.125 --> 55:29.436
What?

55:29.460 --> 55:32.797
Nothing. Nothing.

55:37.502 --> 55:38.903
All right, whoever's
behind there,

55:39.003 --> 55:41.672
come out before we beat
the crap out of you.

55:41.772 --> 55:43.608
Yeah, damn it.

55:45.876 --> 55:46.887
Terribly sorry.

55:46.911 --> 55:47.945
Sorry. Sorry.

55:48.045 --> 55:49.847
Oh, God.

55:49.947 --> 55:51.749
We were trying not
to disturb you.

55:51.849 --> 55:53.217
That's fine, really.

55:53.317 --> 55:55.019
Disturb us? No, no, you
didn't disturb us.

55:55.119 --> 55:56.887
We were just...

55:56.987 --> 55:58.432
So were we.

55:58.456 --> 56:00.825
I see. You think we were...

56:00.925 --> 56:02.960
No, and we're married.

56:03.060 --> 56:04.438
And we have a bed.

56:04.462 --> 56:05.696
I'm Heck, by the way.

56:05.796 --> 56:06.564
Michael.

56:06.664 --> 56:08.499
How do you do? Michael, too.

56:08.599 --> 56:09.700
Oh, really. Rachel.

56:11.469 --> 56:14.839
It's lovely to meet
you two chaps.

56:15.840 --> 56:18.509
Must be very nice to be married.

56:18.609 --> 56:20.911
We only just met this evening.

56:21.011 --> 56:25.115
Yes, sometimes I feel
like we did, too.

56:48.906 --> 56:50.307
Hi. No, no.

56:50.475 --> 56:52.115
You're not your happy to see...
You can't.

56:52.215 --> 56:53.758
I don't want you to
be happy to see me.

56:53.782 --> 56:54.579
Okay.

56:54.679 --> 56:56.581
Okay, so, so I'm here

56:56.681 --> 56:58.124
because I don't know
what's going on.

56:58.148 --> 56:59.192
I don't...

56:59.216 --> 57:00.350
You make me feel something.

57:00.485 --> 57:02.720
Something I absolutely
cannot feel.

57:02.820 --> 57:04.789
I'm married. I'm married,
for Christ's sake.

57:04.889 --> 57:07.758
I have a husband.
This man that I...

57:07.858 --> 57:10.628
This lovely guy. He's
done nothing wrong.

57:10.728 --> 57:13.363
Ah, I was wondering
if you could help me.

57:13.498 --> 57:15.509
I'm hoping to start
a herb garden.

57:15.533 --> 57:17.401
A little corner space.

57:17.502 --> 57:19.303
Not much light. These, these,

57:19.403 --> 57:21.506
on the house, go.

57:23.974 --> 57:26.010
Okay, so do you see?

57:26.110 --> 57:27.311
You have to see.

57:27.411 --> 57:28.813
I can't do this.

57:28.913 --> 57:30.557
I can't actually do this.

57:30.581 --> 57:32.583
So whatever it is, or
was, it's got to stop

57:32.683 --> 57:35.052
and it's got to stop now.
Do you understand?

57:35.152 --> 57:36.521
It's over.

58:16.426 --> 58:17.728
Ow! What, what, what?

58:17.828 --> 58:19.363
Thorns. Thorns in my bum.

58:19.463 --> 58:21.365
Ow. Ow.

58:24.902 --> 58:26.737
I'm sorry.

58:26.837 --> 58:27.837
Ah!

58:32.577 --> 58:34.378
It's another customer.

58:35.580 --> 58:37.247
Hello?

58:41.251 --> 58:43.487
Luce?

58:45.355 --> 58:47.091
Luce, are you in the back?

58:47.191 --> 58:49.359
Um, don't come in, Heck.

58:49.459 --> 58:50.928
I...

58:53.330 --> 58:55.766
I was, um...

58:55.866 --> 58:59.336
I was sorting, you know,
counting the, uh...

58:59.436 --> 59:01.038
Hey.

59:01.138 --> 59:02.339
Hey, yourself.

59:02.439 --> 59:04.875
What do you want, Heck?

59:04.975 --> 59:09.213
To buy some flowers. What else?

59:09.313 --> 59:10.948
Flowers, of course.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.951
Not for me, for my wife Rachel.

59:14.051 --> 59:18.055
Recently, she's just been
a bit, I don't know...

59:18.155 --> 59:19.256
You know what they say,

59:19.356 --> 59:20.636
there's nothing
quite as cheering

59:20.660 --> 59:21.692
as a well-timed bloom.

59:21.792 --> 59:23.637
So I thought one of your
finest arrangements.

59:23.661 --> 59:24.662
Absolutely.

59:24.762 --> 59:26.731
What does she like?

59:26.831 --> 59:30.677
Well, you know what she likes.

59:30.701 --> 59:33.771
Lilies. She likes lilies.

59:33.871 --> 59:37.207
Lilies, right. Well,
that's simple.

59:37.307 --> 59:38.943
Yeah.

59:39.043 --> 59:40.878
So did you enjoy the
football the other night?

59:40.978 --> 59:43.347
Um, it was an experience.

59:43.447 --> 59:48.318
And how did you find Rachel?

59:48.418 --> 59:49.462
Fine.

59:49.486 --> 59:51.388
I mean, I wouldn't...

59:51.488 --> 59:53.691
Fine.

59:53.791 --> 59:56.827
I don't suppose she, um... no.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.796
Well, I was just wondering

59:58.896 --> 01:00:06.136
if she said anything
about me, or, um...

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:11.575
I just think I'm doing
something wrong is all.

01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:13.377
I mean, that's what I think.

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:19.149
And if she said what it is
that I'm doing or not doing,

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:20.785
then I can stop it,

01:00:20.885 --> 01:00:23.754
or start or whatever, you see?

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:25.990
And then we can...

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:28.092
like before.

01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:31.361
We can get back to
being like before.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:34.799
She didn't say anything.

01:00:34.899 --> 01:00:37.201
No?

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.136
I've embarrassed you,

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:42.372
and myself, which is
normal, very normal.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.483
Um, these are beautiful.

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:44.574
How much do I owe you?

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:46.410
No, they're on the house.

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:49.313
Thanks.

01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:52.349
You should ask her, you know?

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:54.218
Not me.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.755
Bless you, but, um...

01:00:57.855 --> 01:00:59.857
I can't ask Rachel if
there's anything wrong.

01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:02.960
I mean, that's way too scary.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.729
Why?

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.332
What if there is?

01:01:10.735 --> 01:01:11.936
Thanks.

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:31.655
Rachel!

01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:32.757
Rachel, wait!

01:01:32.857 --> 01:01:34.792
Luce, please. Just talk to me.

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:36.426
What do you want me to say?

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.762
I heard him! Jesus!

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.773
I'm lying there,
and I heard him,

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:40.865
and he's blaming himself!

01:01:40.965 --> 01:01:42.466
You can put an end to this.

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:43.576
How?

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.835
Tell me to go.

01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:50.507
Tell me that's what you
want and I will walk away,

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:52.877
and you will never see me again.

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:57.147
Is that what you want?

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:02.219
I want you.

01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:08.158
Luce...

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:11.328
I know.

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:14.464
I can't...

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.000
I know.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.474
We'll be okay.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.481
Don't forget me.

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:35.820
I won't remember anything else.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:19.429
Come on, Jeff. You
scratch my back,

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:21.765
and I'll kiss your ass.

01:03:21.866 --> 01:03:23.600
Okay, can you repeat
that, please?

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:26.170
We'll go 41 flat.

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:27.948
Okay, well, let me just fax
it over on his computer

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:29.239
and crunch some numbers.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:31.175
He can't go any higher.
He hasn't got it.

01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:33.978
Yeah, screen's flashing
red at me here, Jeff.

01:03:34.078 --> 01:03:35.445
It's not going to cut it.

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:37.714
In fact, the figure
that I'm reading is...

01:03:37.882 --> 01:03:39.549
Yeah, well, the
figure I'm reading

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.485
is 41 and a half, that's 41.5,

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:43.487
Any lower just can't be a go.

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:45.155
That's way too much.

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:47.457
It's too much.

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.459
So let's do it, Jeff.
Let's work our web.

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.904
Give me 41.1, give me that.

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:52.096
We're feeling no pain there.

01:03:52.196 --> 01:03:54.567
You know what? If we're up .1,

01:03:54.591 --> 01:03:55.831
let's, uh, let's have some fun.

01:03:55.855 --> 01:03:56.877
Let's double down.

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:59.469
Yeah. Yeah, there you go.

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:04.208
All right, keep on coming.

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:06.148
Keep on coming. Give me three.
Three's willing.

01:04:06.172 --> 01:04:07.611
Give me that right now.
You will?

01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:10.047
Well, then go one more.
Go to four.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.983
I really, really, really
don't want to do it.

01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:17.964
Jeff, you know, don't
take that tone with me.

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:19.532
You know, I've given
you a chance here.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:20.991
Now do you want to be a big dog,

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:23.171
or do you want to play on
the porch with the puppies?

01:04:23.195 --> 01:04:25.029
Yeah. Yeah, I feel that.

01:04:25.129 --> 01:04:27.097
Okay, last one, my friend.
Over the cliff.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.997
I'm holding your hand.
I'm cupping your balls.

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:30.708
I'm there with you and
I'm there for you.

01:04:30.732 --> 01:04:33.537
And you've got to ask yourself,
Jeffrey: do you trust me?

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:37.641
Do you trust me?

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:40.577
Congratulations. We can deal.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.949
My boy, for that you get a
bonus as big as my knob.

01:04:45.049 --> 01:04:46.483
Screw your bonus.

01:04:46.543 --> 01:04:48.743
I wish I could. Now where do
you want to go for a drink?

01:04:48.767 --> 01:04:50.554
Screw you, too, Rob.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:53.523
Hecky, what is it?

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:54.824
It makes me sick, you know?

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:57.461
You lie. You just lie.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.499
Well, so do you.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:04.668
Not anymore.

01:05:08.973 --> 01:05:10.707
Heck... Hecky?

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:12.576
Hecky, come back.

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:19.216
Hi.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:21.585
Afternoon.

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:23.287
Looking for a breakup plant.

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:24.388
A what?

01:05:24.488 --> 01:05:25.822
A breakup plant.

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:27.024
Explain.

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:28.725
Well, I don't like
my girlfriend.

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:30.427
I want to break up with her

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:31.895
via the means of plant.

01:05:31.996 --> 01:05:33.663
Well, it should be
a breakup bouquet,

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.132
and it should be hydrangeas.

01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:37.734
They mean "It's over,
but think well of me."

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:38.878
Perfect.

01:05:38.902 --> 01:05:40.013
I'll take one.

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:41.081
One bouquet?

01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:42.506
One pair of what's it.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:44.108
Well, that's not a lot.

01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:46.510
Well, I don't care if
she thinks well of me.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.279
Do you know what? Piss off.

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:51.515
Pardon me? Out. Get
out of my shop.

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:54.284
She's well rid of
your fat ass anyway.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.638
Mum?

01:06:14.738 --> 01:06:17.474
I'll be right out!

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:19.409
Take your time.

01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:36.293
Well, sweet shit in a bucket,
what's wrong with you?

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:40.130
Blow your nose, then explain.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:46.203
I met this girl.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:50.140
She's with someone else.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.509
Does she love you?

01:06:54.078 --> 01:06:56.246
I don't know.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.115
No.

01:07:01.285 --> 01:07:02.652
Yes.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:07.191
But it doesn't matter.

01:07:07.291 --> 01:07:11.095
Oh, it's all that matters.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:12.729
She's with someone else.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.231
She can't...

01:07:18.602 --> 01:07:20.737
When Dad left you,
he broke your heart.

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:24.641
It mends again.

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:31.014
Look at you. You look fantastic.

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:35.585
I may be older than God, but
I can still make an effort.

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:36.920
A date?

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:37.921
Does my mother

01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:39.223
have a date?

01:07:39.323 --> 01:07:41.825
I'm going to eat food
with a man, yes.

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:44.194
How do you feel?

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:47.497
Oh, um, well, you know,

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:50.467
when you're holding
a hot cup of coffee

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.636
and you realize you're
going to sneeze?

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.838
That's how I feel.

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:56.940
Come here.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.776
Oh, baby.

Just, um... three more of these,

I-I wanted to talk to
you because, um...

01:08:55.432 --> 01:09:00.370
I have to talk to you because
this thing happened.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.640
I wasn't looking for it.

01:09:04.741 --> 01:09:05.975

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:09.546
It just happened,

it's over,

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:16.286
um...

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:19.488
you have a right to know.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:34.638
I went crazy, Heck.

01:09:39.343 --> 01:09:43.412
I went crazy for someone,
and it wasn't you.

01:09:48.252 --> 01:09:50.254
I'm sorry.

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:58.328
I'm so very sorry, so...

01:10:01.365 --> 01:10:03.867
Please believe me.

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:07.070
Heck...

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:09.706
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, don't sleep.

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:10.907
Wake... Heck?

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:14.678
I can't say this more than once.

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:19.583
I'm staying.

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:26.390
I couldn't, wouldn't leave you.

01:10:28.325 --> 01:10:30.594
You're my best friend.

01:10:31.395 --> 01:10:34.097
And that was enough before.

01:10:34.197 --> 01:10:37.367
It'll be enough again, so...

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.676
Coop.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.077
It is you, then.

01:11:21.177 --> 01:11:22.746
Is it?

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:24.814
Is what? I don't...

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:26.215
Heck doesn't know.

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:29.453
He said that she
didn't tell who.

01:11:29.553 --> 01:11:32.722
But, um, I figured it out.

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:35.258
What'd he say?

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:37.927
Just tell me I'm wrong, girl.

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:40.597
Hmm? Tell me.

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:45.034
You dumb slut.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.003
Don't start, Coop.

01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:48.271
Don't start?

01:11:48.372 --> 01:11:51.174
Her husband, her
flippin' husband

01:11:51.274 --> 01:11:52.718
calls me in the
middle of the night.

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:54.511
You want to know how he was?

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:56.380
He was busted.
Just-just get out.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.182
What was that thing that you said?
What was that?

01:11:59.282 --> 01:12:01.184
Never wreck another couple.

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:04.388
You really stuck to that
one good, didn't you?

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:16.900
Okay, then.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.444
Okay. Yeah.

01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:20.970
See you. Bye.

01:12:28.745 --> 01:12:30.780
It's wonderful. Thank you.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.017
There's a lovely section on
cooking with your children.

01:12:34.117 --> 01:12:35.985
Who was on the phone, honey?

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:37.320
Luce.

01:12:37.421 --> 01:12:39.288
She was supposed to take
me and my boyfriend

01:12:39.423 --> 01:12:40.703
to the museum, but
now we're not.

01:12:40.727 --> 01:12:43.860
Oh, uh... maybe some other time.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.194
Not for a while.

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:46.996
She's going on a
very long holiday.

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:49.442
She is?

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:52.168
When was the last time
you took me on holiday?

01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:53.570
The summer of '94.

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:55.171
Great Barrier Reef.

01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:57.173
You scared all the sharks away.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:01.344
She didn't mention
that the other night.

01:13:01.445 --> 01:13:03.456
No, yes, she did say
something, I remember now.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.080
Will you take me to the museum?

01:13:05.104 --> 01:13:06.349
And can Heck come, too?

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:07.884
Of course he can.

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:10.119
Do penguins have knees?

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.821
Well, this is fun, isn't it?

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:14.624
Shame it's only once a year.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.994
Happy birthday to you.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:21.565

♪ Happy birthday to you.

01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:31.666

I can't do it.

01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:33.142
I thought I could,
but I can't do it.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.712
Blow out the candles, darling.
What's happening?

01:13:35.812 --> 01:13:37.523
I'm going. It's good cake.

01:13:37.547 --> 01:13:39.282
Your mother got the
recipe from this book

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:40.526
before she wrapped it.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.118
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:13:42.218 --> 01:13:43.386
If you respect me at all,

01:13:43.487 --> 01:13:44.988
that's exactly what you will do.

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:46.599
Will you kindly tell me
what you're talking about?

01:13:46.623 --> 01:13:47.724
Why's Heck being sad?

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:49.058
It's not you leaving

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.494
that's gonna kill me.

01:13:50.594 --> 01:13:53.129
It's you loving someone more.

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:54.397
Sorry to interrupt.

01:13:54.498 --> 01:13:56.299
Those candles are dripping wax

01:13:56.399 --> 01:13:57.867
all over your mother's creation.

01:13:57.967 --> 01:14:00.369
Will you fuck off with
the fucking candles!

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:04.574
Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.277
No, you're not walking away.

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:10.614
Don't-don't walk away from me.
Yeah, keep saying that.

01:14:10.714 --> 01:14:12.525
Let me pretend
this is my choice.

01:14:12.549 --> 01:14:14.560
What do you mean?
Oh, come on, Rach,

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:17.153
you both know you left
me in the end anyway.

01:14:17.253 --> 01:14:21.157
That's not true. Yes, it is!

01:14:23.527 --> 01:14:25.629
Yes, it is.

01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:29.065
I want you to be happy.

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:34.838
More than anything else, I wanted to
be the cause of happiness in you.

01:14:34.938 --> 01:14:36.439
But if I'm not,

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.042
then...

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:41.377
I can't stand in the way.

01:14:41.545 --> 01:14:44.047
Do you see?

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:48.618
Because what you're feeling now...
Rachel,

01:14:49.753 --> 01:14:53.222
is the unstoppable force.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:58.695
Which means that
I've got to move.

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:17.213
Darling, what did Heck mean

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:20.817
when he said you're in
love with someone else?

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:23.587
I am in love with someone else.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:26.322
Cooper. That trollop.

01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:28.291
He'd shag an open wound.

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:31.260
Not him.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.638
Who, then?

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:34.330
Well, out with it.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:37.133
What's his name? Who
is the lucky chap?

01:15:40.804 --> 01:15:44.608
Her name... is Luce.

01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:47.777
Luce?

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.312
Yes.

01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:52.515
Who's a woman.

01:15:52.616 --> 01:15:55.151
As are you a woman.

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:57.186
That's right.

01:15:57.286 --> 01:16:00.123
So the two of you are...

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:02.258
"lesbie" friends?

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:03.760
It doesn't matter
what you call it,

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.461
it's not going to happen.

01:16:05.629 --> 01:16:07.263
Not after all this.

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:08.932
Quite bloody right.

01:16:09.032 --> 01:16:10.499
Could I...

01:16:10.634 --> 01:16:11.835
say something here?

01:16:17.707 --> 01:16:21.110
When I first met your mother...

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:23.312
back in the Trojan War...

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.484
I fell for her...

01:16:28.652 --> 01:16:31.921
right off the bat.

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:37.293
And although she loved me
back, she married me...

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:42.708
somehow I always knew I was...

01:16:42.732 --> 01:16:45.702
never quite up to snuff.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.839
We muddled along,

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:53.109
got through the years,

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:58.014
but I never doubted that if she ever
met anyone she really fell for,

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:01.818
who made her realize
what true love is...

01:17:03.753 --> 01:17:06.690
she'd leave me like a shot.

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:09.793
And how could I argue?

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:15.598
Whatever you choose
to do from here,

01:17:15.699 --> 01:17:18.802
we'll support you;
we always will.

01:17:18.902 --> 01:17:22.739
But please, my darling...

01:17:22.839 --> 01:17:25.141
follow your heart.

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:27.576
Can I borrow your car?

01:17:27.711 --> 01:17:29.045
I'll drive you.

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:33.316
Nothing happens
without me there.

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:39.288
You coming?

01:17:41.725 --> 01:17:44.060
When we come back,
we'll talk about this

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.594
if you want to.

01:17:45.729 --> 01:17:47.563
Yeah.

01:17:47.731 --> 01:17:50.533
Do you know what I wish?

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:52.869
You wouldn't grow up so fast.

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:05.749
You take care, then.

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:07.316
You take care.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:08.584
I'm going to enjoy myself.

01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:12.488
Hey.

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:14.323
You did nothing wrong.

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:17.593
I did.

01:18:17.761 --> 01:18:19.763
Truth is, I'd do it again.

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:01.971
Why don't you have
pudding after breakfast?

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:04.040
You have it after
lunch and dinner,

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.109
so why not in the
morning, as well?

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:09.645
I think it weird.

01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:12.816
You're still sad, aren't you?

01:19:14.017 --> 01:19:16.652
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.521
I knew you would be.

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:21.424
I bought you sweets.

01:19:21.524 --> 01:19:23.526
Thank you.

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:25.829
Great.

01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:27.840
I didn't know which
is your favorite,

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:29.498
so I bought pick mix.

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:40.143
Oh, sorry, H. Sorry.

01:19:40.243 --> 01:19:42.011
It's just, um...

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.981
I'm trying to do the
right thing, and, um...

01:19:46.749 --> 01:19:49.218
and now I think I
should have not.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.057
'Cause... if she'd stayed
with me out of guilt,

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:56.592
that would have been
fine, wouldn't it?

01:19:56.692 --> 01:19:57.726
I mean, wouldn't it?

01:19:57.861 --> 01:20:01.364
My math teacher, Mrs. Latracy,

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:04.834
has something she always
says when people are sad.

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:06.702
She says no problem
isn't soluble

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:08.905
given a big enough plastic bag.

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:13.943
What does that mean?

01:20:14.043 --> 01:20:15.544
I don't know.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.546
She's a bit unusual.

01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:20.549
I should have married you.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.118
Maybe in ten years.

01:20:22.218 --> 01:20:24.954
If you're still lonely, we
could get married then.

01:20:26.455 --> 01:20:28.925
You know, it's funny.

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:31.227
Ever since we first
met, I was...

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:33.429
scared that she was
going to leave me.

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:35.731
You shouldn't be afraid, Heck.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.167
You can do anything.

01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:48.844
Hurry, hurry, please.
Take a left here.

01:20:48.945 --> 01:20:50.579
I just think if not Heck,

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.515
there must be other
fish in the sea.

01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:54.317
Male fish.

01:20:54.417 --> 01:20:56.619
Is it straight on? Yes.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:57.720
It's rather exciting.

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:58.998
What about my grandchildren?

01:20:59.022 --> 01:21:00.289
Who will be providing them?

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:02.258
I believe there's a
marvelous new invention,

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:03.726
somewhat akin to
the turkey baster.

01:21:03.826 --> 01:21:05.328
Just up here.

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:09.565
Hey, where did you two meet?

01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:10.766
At my wedding.

01:21:10.934 --> 01:21:12.401
But it's such a short time.

01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:13.569
How can you be sure?

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:15.838
I knew after three seconds.

01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:18.607
I've heard of love
happening that fast.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.476
The French call it le flash.

01:21:20.576 --> 01:21:22.946
They would, bloody perverts.

01:21:23.947 --> 01:21:25.381
Where's Luce? Is she here?

01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:29.085
Would you like to try
that entrance again?

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:31.354
Hello.

01:21:31.454 --> 01:21:32.355
Please.

01:21:32.455 --> 01:21:33.489
I'm looking for Luce.

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:36.969
You're her, aren't you?

01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:39.362
You're the girl.

01:21:40.796 --> 01:21:42.698
Yes, I am.

01:21:42.798 --> 01:21:44.367
You have a husband.

01:21:45.668 --> 01:21:47.370
I left him.

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:50.039
He left me.

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:53.042
It doesn't matter. It's over.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:57.380
So you're free?

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:01.284
And you love my daughter?

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:04.587
Golly.

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:10.002
Um, have you ever

01:22:10.026 --> 01:22:12.295
sold flowers before?

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.403

01:22:20.503 --> 01:22:24.273

01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:25.741
I like that.

01:22:25.841 --> 01:22:27.743
I like that very much.

01:22:27.843 --> 01:22:30.646
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:22:30.746 --> 01:22:32.415
Do you mind? I'm talking here!

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:34.755

way 'cause the traffic's...

downstairs or upstairs?

01:22:46.062 --> 01:22:48.364
You're quite wrong, you know.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:49.932
You've always been
enough for me.

01:22:50.033 --> 01:22:52.268
Not recently.

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:57.406
There are pills one can take.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:01.210
I could buy some.

Yes, I could.
