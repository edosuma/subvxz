00:14.661 --> 00:17.940
Hello? Is anybody out here?

00:56.219 --> 00:57.498
All right.

00:57.499 --> 00:59.743
12-letter word for "transcendent."

01:00.827 --> 01:02.551
Otherworldly.

01:03.403 --> 01:05.865
Honestly, sometimes it's
like they're not even trying.

01:05.866 --> 01:09.554
Doing the crossword in pen?
Feeling cocky today, are we?

01:09.555 --> 01:11.174
What is life without challenges?

01:11.387 --> 01:14.039
8-letter word for "estrange."

01:14.059 --> 01:16.442
Ah! You are just in time,
my mini thesaurus.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.754
I need an 8-letter word for
"estrange."

01:18.755 --> 01:21.663
She doesn't hear you, darling.
She's still talking to Ashley.

01:21.891 --> 01:23.056
I should be timing
that phone call.

01:23.057 --> 01:25.508
That's gotta be a record. Please.

01:25.509 --> 01:27.604
I've had relationships
that didn't last this long.

01:27.605 --> 01:28.385
True.

01:28.386 --> 01:29.879
Okay. Bye.

01:30.732 --> 01:33.657
Sorry. We were talking about
the hiking trip next Saturday.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.506
Oh, has Ashley got the all
clear from his parents

01:35.507 --> 01:36.219
to come with us?

01:36.220 --> 01:38.570
They say they want
to meet you first.

01:38.571 --> 01:41.002
Ah, they want to
vet me to make sure

01:41.003 --> 01:42.760
if there's some
kind of rock slide,

01:42.761 --> 01:45.704
that I won't leave their boy
stranded on a mountainside,

01:45.705 --> 01:48.656
having to gnaw off his
own arm to survive.

01:48.657 --> 01:49.770
So you'll do it?

01:49.771 --> 01:50.638
We'll have them over for dinner.

01:50.639 --> 01:52.029
We'll schmooze and impress them.

01:52.030 --> 01:53.501
Would you like me
to cook something?

01:53.502 --> 01:55.202
No, we want to impress them.

01:55.318 --> 01:57.242
And what is that supposed to mean?

01:59.599 --> 02:01.561
So it's "meet the parents" time,
huh, Castle?

02:01.562 --> 02:04.033
This is a pretty
critical moment for you.

02:04.034 --> 02:05.982
For me? Why me?

02:06.162 --> 02:09.199
Well, I mean, Ashley is
Alexis' first love, right?

02:09.201 --> 02:10.193
Mm-hmm.

02:10.193 --> 02:11.385
Well, what do you
think will happen

02:11.386 --> 02:12.770
if you don't get on
with his parents?

02:12.771 --> 02:16.481
She'll lose interest in him? 
Oh, no. The exact opposite.

02:16.482 --> 02:18.769
I mean, it'll make their
romance feel forbidden,

02:18.770 --> 02:21.561
and they'll be off
doing God knows what.

02:21.562 --> 02:23.941
Trust me. I know.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.166
I never thought of it that way.

02:26.650 --> 02:28.641
My advice is keep
the boyfriend close

02:28.642 --> 02:30.246
but the parents closer.

02:30.427 --> 02:31.606
Hey, guys.

02:31.698 --> 02:33.341
What do we got?
Something messed up.

02:33.342 --> 02:34.858
I've never seen anything like it.

02:35.133 --> 02:38.500
Victim's name is Marie
Subbarao. She's 35.

02:38.501 --> 02:40.020
Security guard found
her last night.

02:40.021 --> 02:41.372
Still getting over it.

02:41.373 --> 02:44.484
Wow. She looks like an
overstuffed sausage.

02:44.485 --> 02:47.228
Lanie, what the hell
happened to her?

02:47.229 --> 02:49.778
It's called explosive
decompression.

02:50.366 --> 02:52.876
From what? What would cause this?

02:52.877 --> 02:56.485
It's a result of exposure to a
zero-atmosphere environment.

02:56.486 --> 03:00.005
Zero atmosphere? As in...
Outer space?

03:00.006 --> 03:01.322
Yep.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.992
- Or? - I don't have an "or"
for you right now, sweetie.

03:05.993 --> 03:07.708
I have to get her body
back to the morgue,

03:07.709 --> 03:09.817
and then I may have some answers.

03:09.941 --> 03:11.635
Okay, well, her body's in a car

03:11.636 --> 03:13.427
in the middle of the rail yard,

03:13.428 --> 03:15.683
so clearly she wasn't
killed in outer space.

03:15.684 --> 03:18.833
There's gotta be
another explanation.

03:21.127 --> 03:22.509
Check this out... She was reading

03:22.510 --> 03:26.811
"Taken by the Fourth Kind",
a book on alien abductions.

03:28.127 --> 03:31.014
So what's your theory, Castle,
that she was abducted

03:31.015 --> 03:32.742
and then killed by aliens?

03:32.743 --> 03:34.247
Mm. The story that
makes more sense

03:34.248 --> 03:37.084
is, uh, alien
abduction gone wrong...

03:37.174 --> 03:39.486
One that ends with Marie
being accidentally blasted

03:39.487 --> 03:41.876
out of the air lock of
the alien spaceship.

03:42.031 --> 03:45.598
Well, if it was E.T.,
he has a nicotine addiction.

03:45.599 --> 03:47.718
We found this cigarette
butt by the rear tire.

03:47.719 --> 03:49.262
It was laying in the track,

03:49.263 --> 03:51.718
which means it was dropped
after the car was parked.

03:51.719 --> 03:53.925
All right. Well,
have C.S.U. check for D.N.A.

03:53.926 --> 03:55.133
Maybe we'll get lucky.

03:55.134 --> 03:58.230
And can you look into
explosive decompression,

03:58.231 --> 04:00.509
see what else might cause it?
You got it.

04:00.510 --> 04:01.683
Thank you.

04:02.438 --> 04:03.859
You do have to admit,

04:04.015 --> 04:07.635
her condition does seem...
Otherworldly.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.074
Marie Subbarao...

04:12.495 --> 04:13.574
The before version.

04:13.575 --> 04:16.380
Born in Chicago, did postgrad
work at Johns Hopkins,

04:16.382 --> 04:17.010
then two years ago,

04:17.011 --> 04:19.415
she takes a job at the Aubrey
Science Center in Midtown

04:19.416 --> 04:21.492
as an astrophysicist.

04:24.065 --> 04:25.262
Doing what?

04:25.263 --> 04:26.480
I'm not really sure.

04:26.481 --> 04:28.719
According to the
center's web site,

04:28.720 --> 04:31.071
she recently landed a grant
from the SETI institute.

04:31.072 --> 04:34.055
The search for extraterrestrial
intelligence SETI?

04:34.056 --> 04:36.070
That could explain why...
No, it couldn't.

04:36.071 --> 04:38.527
So her working for SETI is
just a wild coincidence?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.376
I'm saying,
it's an interesting fact

04:40.377 --> 04:42.351
that is unrelated to our case.

04:42.352 --> 04:45.404
Aliens were not involved
in Marie Subbarao's death.

04:46.872 --> 04:48.060
Uh, I don't know.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.973
Why, Detective Ryan,
I never figured you for a believer.

04:50.974 --> 04:53.326
All I know is,
my father's cousin Raymond

04:53.327 --> 04:54.813
left this party in
Jersey one night.

04:54.814 --> 04:56.734
He's driving back to Queens,
and bam!

04:56.735 --> 04:58.751
Blinding bright light
comes down from the sky,

04:58.752 --> 05:00.117
next thing he knows, it's morning,

05:00.118 --> 05:01.462
he's on the side of
the Jersey turnpike.

05:01.463 --> 05:03.893
Let me guess.
No memory of what happened.

05:03.894 --> 05:06.133
That is not called
an alien abduction.

05:06.134 --> 05:08.302
That is called a hangover.

05:08.303 --> 05:11.858
Maybe. Raymond always was the
lightweight in the family.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.262
Speaking of family,

05:13.263 --> 05:15.246
did our victim have any,
a husband maybe?

05:15.247 --> 05:17.006
Neighbors say she was
single and lived alone.

05:17.007 --> 05:17.998
They barely saw her.

05:17.999 --> 05:20.690
Apparently, she normally came
home from work around 10:00 P.M.

05:20.694 --> 05:24.707
Lanie said that the time of
death was around 9:00 P.M.,

05:24.759 --> 05:26.294
which means work
was the last place

05:26.295 --> 05:27.995
that she was probably seen alive.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.639
This is unbelievable.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.127
Marie was one of my
most gifted researchers.

05:34.128 --> 05:35.703
What did she do here exactly?

05:35.704 --> 05:37.391
Uh, she analyzed the data

05:37.392 --> 05:39.670
fed in from our radio
telescope in new Mexico,

05:39.671 --> 05:41.878
studying radiation from quasars.

05:41.879 --> 05:43.122
For the SETI institute?

05:43.123 --> 05:45.943
No. Most of her work
was NASA related.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.309
And when was the last
time you saw her?

05:48.790 --> 05:52.422
Uh, last night. She was still
here at her office at 7:00 when I left.

05:53.975 --> 05:56.306
And what about you, Ms. Holder?

05:57.134 --> 05:59.453
Oh, we went over the
calendar for next week,

05:59.454 --> 06:01.253
and then she sent me home at 7:30.

06:01.254 --> 06:04.278
Was she having any
problems in life?

06:04.279 --> 06:06.699
Anything unusual happening lately?

06:06.757 --> 06:09.389
Not that I'm aware of. Actually...

06:09.390 --> 06:13.350
Since Monday, she'd been
acting anxious and uptight.

06:13.351 --> 06:15.149
I finally asked her what
was wrong, and she said

06:15.150 --> 06:18.262
that something life-changing
had happened to her.

06:18.263 --> 06:19.982
What was it?
I don't know.

06:19.983 --> 06:22.486
Then on Wednesday, she left
work in the middle of the day.

06:22.487 --> 06:24.805
She didn't come back
until Thursday morning.

06:24.806 --> 06:26.478
Dr. Vaughn, Marie's body

06:26.479 --> 06:28.702
showed signs of
explosive decompression.

06:28.703 --> 06:29.991
Was she doing any kind of research

06:29.992 --> 06:31.130
that would account for that?

06:31.131 --> 06:32.257
Oh, my God.

06:32.258 --> 06:33.583
That's a yes.

06:33.603 --> 06:35.058
It's called an altitude chamber.

06:35.059 --> 06:36.005
We use it to study

06:36.006 --> 06:39.126
thermal life support systems
under reduced pressure for NASA.

06:39.819 --> 06:41.809
What would happen if
a person went inside?

06:41.810 --> 06:43.233
Without protective gear?

06:43.234 --> 06:45.681
Mm-hmm. 
Your lungs rupture

06:45.682 --> 06:46.953
from gas expansion

06:46.954 --> 06:48.769
and all the liquid in
your body evaporates.

06:48.770 --> 06:51.911
So all the horrible
effects of outer space

06:51.912 --> 06:53.166
without the view.

06:53.167 --> 06:54.645
Who else had access to this area?

06:54.646 --> 06:56.606
Mostly our researchers
and their assistants.

06:56.607 --> 06:58.330
Maybe 35 people in all.

06:58.331 --> 06:59.857
I'll need a list of
all of their names.

06:59.858 --> 07:02.423
Did Marie have problems
with any of them?

07:03.642 --> 07:04.817
Ted Carter...

07:04.818 --> 07:06.042
Her ex-boyfriend.

07:06.043 --> 07:09.017
After their breakup,
things got ugly between them.

07:12.836 --> 07:14.291
Can I ask what this is about?

07:14.292 --> 07:15.451
Mr. Carter...

07:15.452 --> 07:18.251
Your key card was swiped
at the science center

07:18.252 --> 07:20.075
last night at 7:42.

07:20.076 --> 07:21.858
You mind tell us what
you were doing there?

07:21.859 --> 07:24.708
I went to see someone.
Marie Subbarao?

07:24.709 --> 07:26.250
Why is this any of your business?

07:26.251 --> 07:27.951
We're investigating her murder.

07:28.451 --> 07:29.694
What?

07:30.339 --> 07:31.775
Marie's not dead.

07:32.491 --> 07:34.135
How could she be dead?

07:34.546 --> 07:37.087
Someone put her in
an altitude chamber.

07:38.915 --> 07:40.079
Oh, my God.

07:40.091 --> 07:41.522
Who could've done
something like that?

07:41.523 --> 07:43.831
She was killed at
around 9:00 P.M.,

07:43.898 --> 07:46.711
not long after you
arrived at the center.

07:47.770 --> 07:50.066
Not me. It wasn't me.

07:50.067 --> 07:51.859
How could you think I would
do something like that?

07:51.860 --> 07:53.026
You had motive.

07:53.027 --> 07:54.570
You had access to the chamber.

07:54.571 --> 07:55.965
Why else would you
even go and see her?

07:55.966 --> 07:57.461
To ask her to dinner.

07:57.462 --> 08:00.854
After Marie dumped you and
had you fired. I hope...

08:00.855 --> 08:02.567
It wasn't like that. I quit.

08:02.568 --> 08:04.975
It was too painful
to be around her.

08:04.976 --> 08:08.312
Then on Wednesday,
out of nowhere, she called me.

08:08.313 --> 08:09.352
She wanted to go to coffee.

08:09.353 --> 08:10.824
Now why would she do that?

08:10.825 --> 08:13.245
To mend fences, I-I guess.

08:13.471 --> 08:15.688
She gave me back
some old t-shirts,

08:15.689 --> 08:17.471
some CDs she had of mine,

08:17.472 --> 08:20.224
said she felt bad about
the way things ended.

08:20.892 --> 08:23.929
I thought maybe we still
had a chance, you know?

08:25.092 --> 08:26.963
So I went looking for
her at the center.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.167
What happened when you found her?
Nothing.

08:29.772 --> 08:31.847
We talked for a few seconds.

08:32.131 --> 08:34.147
She seemed upset about something.

08:34.148 --> 08:35.755
I-I tried to find out what,

08:35.756 --> 08:38.751
but she was in a hurry to
get somewhere, so I left.

08:39.589 --> 08:40.674
I went home.

08:40.674 --> 08:42.376
I-I was there by 8:00.

08:43.452 --> 08:44.919
Make yourself at home.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.977
You're gonna be here for a while.

08:49.339 --> 08:51.938
C.S.U. is going through
the altitude chamber.

08:51.939 --> 08:53.477
Once they get back with forensics,

08:53.478 --> 08:55.662
we should be able to
charge Ted Carter.

08:55.663 --> 08:57.041
Tell me this...

08:57.076 --> 09:00.179
How did Carter get the
body to the rail yard?

09:00.822 --> 09:02.479
Well, the altitude chamber

09:02.480 --> 09:04.266
is right next to
the parking garage,

09:04.267 --> 09:06.546
so he probably dumped
her body in the car,

09:06.547 --> 09:07.970
took it out to the rail yard,

09:07.971 --> 09:09.515
and tried to throw
us off the trail.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.195
You know what would
be a better story?

09:11.196 --> 09:12.319
Hmm?

09:14.922 --> 09:17.651
We have an earthbound
solution to this mystery,

09:17.652 --> 09:19.947
and you are disappointed.
I get it.

09:19.948 --> 09:22.074
But that, really?

09:22.075 --> 09:24.746
Come on. Marie said she
had a life-changing event.

09:24.747 --> 09:26.058
What could be more life-changing

09:26.059 --> 09:28.581
than being beamed up by this guy?

09:28.582 --> 09:29.358
Come on, Castle.

09:29.359 --> 09:31.126
We all know that there
is no such thing

09:31.127 --> 09:32.765
as alien abductions.

09:32.766 --> 09:35.645
And yet, most abductees
report the same experiences...

09:35.646 --> 09:38.406
the white light,
the memory flashes.

09:38.407 --> 09:40.630
That's because they all
read the same books,

09:40.631 --> 09:42.670
so of course they
describe the same event...

09:42.671 --> 09:44.270
The dark, lonely road,

09:44.271 --> 09:45.707
the bright light out of nowhere,

09:45.708 --> 09:48.450
memories of being
poked and prodded.

09:48.451 --> 09:51.442
I believe the word you're
looking for is probed.

09:51.443 --> 09:53.626
And then of course
there's the alien implant

09:53.627 --> 09:55.571
that's used to track
the abductees.

09:55.572 --> 09:58.739
That reminds me of the Lego I got
stuck up my nose when I was 6.

09:58.740 --> 09:59.690
You what?

09:59.691 --> 10:01.315
Uh, guys.

10:01.316 --> 10:03.912
C.S.U. finished going
over the altitude chamber.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.757
Nothing turned up. 
What?

10:06.758 --> 10:08.349
I mean, that was the exact machine

10:08.350 --> 10:10.099
that we were looking for,
right in the building

10:10.100 --> 10:11.440
where Marie and her
ex-boyfriend work.

10:11.441 --> 10:13.065
That had to have been
the murder weapon.

10:13.066 --> 10:15.734
There's no blood,
no tissue... it's clean.

10:16.898 --> 10:19.918
That makes no sense whatsoever.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.514
Check other altitude chambers.

10:23.515 --> 10:24.810
It's not like they grow on trees.

10:24.811 --> 10:26.793
Well, that can't be
the only one around.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.489
And look for any other devices
that cause the same injuries.

10:29.490 --> 10:30.782
I'll do my best.

10:31.963 --> 10:33.458
If it's not an altitude chamber,

10:33.459 --> 10:34.903
then what could it be?

10:39.211 --> 10:40.480
Other than that.

10:44.147 --> 10:45.296
Beckett.

10:46.714 --> 10:47.778
Lanie, what'd you find?

10:47.779 --> 10:49.459
Not the answers I was looking for.

10:49.460 --> 10:52.873
Instead, just more questions.
How deliciously cryptic.

10:52.874 --> 10:55.435
Because of the unique
nature of Marie's injuries,

10:55.436 --> 10:57.642
I wanted to thoroughly
document her condition

10:57.643 --> 10:59.513
before conducting the autopsy.

10:59.514 --> 11:01.490
While I was taking the x-rays,

11:01.491 --> 11:04.066
I saw this embedded
in her sinus cavity.

11:04.067 --> 11:06.702
What is that? 
I have no idea.

11:07.132 --> 11:08.512
Call me crazy...

11:09.506 --> 11:13.232
That looks just like...
An alien implant.

11:24.938 --> 11:27.314
What could you
possibly be looking for

11:27.315 --> 11:28.919
by probing up there?

11:29.282 --> 11:30.662
Can we talk about dinner?

11:31.516 --> 11:32.857
Oh, no.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.826
You couldn't convince gram
to stay out of the kitchen.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.922
I will stock up on
antacids and garbage bags.

11:36.923 --> 11:39.504
No, it isn't that.
It's Ashley's parents.

11:39.505 --> 11:40.337
What about 'em?

11:40.338 --> 11:42.088
He's an economics professor.

11:42.089 --> 11:44.024
The two of them are
serious people, dad.

11:44.025 --> 11:46.924
Y-you may need to
be more buttoned up.

11:47.042 --> 11:48.405
I can be buttoned up.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.377
And if I become unbuttoned,

11:50.378 --> 11:53.440
you can discreetly let me know
with a brutal kick to the shin.

11:53.441 --> 11:54.860
I won't be there.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.552
They thought it would be better
if it was just you and gram.

11:57.553 --> 12:00.181
You're gonna leave me alone?
You'll do great.

12:00.433 --> 12:03.934
I just wanted to make sure that
you'll make a good impression.

12:04.104 --> 12:06.765
Trust me...
So do I.

12:10.050 --> 12:11.792
Where do you come down
on deficit spending

12:11.793 --> 12:13.744
during an economic downturn?
Thank you.

12:13.745 --> 12:16.553
I take the theory that's
held by most economists...

12:16.554 --> 12:18.281
That deficit spending
is acceptable

12:18.282 --> 12:20.695
as long as it focuses
on public investments,

12:20.696 --> 12:24.400
like infrastructure, defense,
education, research.

12:24.401 --> 12:25.953
Wow. Where did that
answer come from?

12:25.954 --> 12:27.457
Semester of economic
theory at N.Y.U.

12:27.458 --> 12:28.761
Where did that question come from?

12:28.762 --> 12:30.386
I'm trying out
conversation starters.

12:30.387 --> 12:32.441
Well, we started a conversation,

12:32.442 --> 12:34.817
so I guess it worked... kind of.

12:34.818 --> 12:37.402
It's for a dinner
with Ashley's parents.

12:37.403 --> 12:39.602
He's this stuffy economist,
you know?

12:39.603 --> 12:41.292
And I just want to win 'em over,
get them on my side.

12:41.293 --> 12:42.580
But what if they don't take to me?

12:42.581 --> 12:45.098
Oh, come on, Castle. They'll take to you.
Really?

12:45.099 --> 12:45.989
Yeah.
Thanks.

12:45.990 --> 12:49.469
So long as you don't act like yourself.
Oh, nice one.

12:49.470 --> 12:52.580
So where do we stand on
this mysterious implant?

12:52.581 --> 12:53.933
It is not an implant.

12:53.934 --> 12:55.836
Lanie says that it's
a metal fragment,

12:55.837 --> 12:57.776
and she's running
tests on it right now.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.304
How'd it get up her nose?

12:59.305 --> 13:01.233
Well, maybe it was a piece
of the altitude chamber

13:01.234 --> 13:02.401
that got lodged up there.

13:02.402 --> 13:04.049
The altitude chamber
we haven't found?

13:04.050 --> 13:07.906
Yet. The altitude chamber
that we haven't found yet.

13:07.907 --> 13:09.473
And I'm sure that
as soon as we do,

13:09.474 --> 13:12.001
it will lead us
straight to our killer.

13:12.002 --> 13:14.243
I notice you said "killer"
and not Ted Carter.

13:14.244 --> 13:16.521
Yeah, Carter alibied out.

13:16.522 --> 13:18.666
He ordered pizza the
night of Marie's murder

13:18.667 --> 13:20.553
and signed for it at 8:25.

13:20.554 --> 13:22.288
Alibis in 30 minutes or less.

13:22.289 --> 13:25.704
So at this point,
we have no human suspects.

13:25.705 --> 13:29.025
By definition, no suspect means
"no human suspect."

13:29.026 --> 13:30.896
Well, one might be
coming your way.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.761
I checked Marie's
phone logs at work.

13:32.762 --> 13:34.497
Turns out she made a
30-minute phone call

13:34.498 --> 13:37.152
- before she left the science
center on Wednesday. - To whom?

13:37.153 --> 13:40.080
Benny Stryker. 
The Benny Stryker?

13:40.081 --> 13:41.809
This Benny Stryker,

13:41.810 --> 13:44.146
renowned author of
"Taken by the Fourth Kind"?

13:44.147 --> 13:45.249
One and the same.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.832
An astrophysicist and a ufologist,

13:47.833 --> 13:49.569
isn't that like oil and water?

13:49.570 --> 13:51.937
Actually, they used
to be colleagues.

13:51.938 --> 13:52.720
Three years ago,

13:52.721 --> 13:55.041
he and Marie were members
of the same research team,

13:55.042 --> 13:57.265
but Marie was worried
that all his UFO talk

13:57.266 --> 13:58.518
would destroy their credibility,

13:58.519 --> 14:00.652
so she had him
kicked off the team.

14:00.653 --> 14:03.598
From what I hear,
there's been bad blood ever since.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.209
Where can we find Stryker?

14:05.210 --> 14:09.150
Imprisoned in a cold white room...

14:09.234 --> 14:12.710
Strange faces staring
down at us...

14:13.346 --> 14:16.318
These are images
that will haunt us.

14:16.386 --> 14:18.445
But they'll also unite us

14:18.586 --> 14:20.398
and help us remember,

14:20.938 --> 14:23.177
we didn't choose this.

14:23.178 --> 14:24.750
We were chosen.

14:25.147 --> 14:25.922
One more time.

14:25.923 --> 14:29.090
We didn't choose this.
We were chosen.

14:29.091 --> 14:31.758
He's like the Tony Robbins
of alien abductions.

14:32.666 --> 14:34.136
I see we have some new members.

14:34.137 --> 14:36.647
Maybe you'd like to introduce yourself,
tell us your story.

14:37.586 --> 14:38.726
Huh.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.633
Do you actually think

14:41.634 --> 14:43.696
I had something to do
with Marie's death?

14:43.697 --> 14:46.200
Mr. Stryker, where were you
on Thursday at 9:00 P.M.?

14:46.201 --> 14:48.889
At a book signing in Queens.

14:48.890 --> 14:51.208
But you did have recent
contact with Marie.

14:51.209 --> 14:54.062
In fact, she called
you on Wednesday.

14:54.098 --> 14:55.319
What was that about?

14:55.771 --> 14:57.168
You know, I could tell you,

14:57.169 --> 14:58.769
but I see,
you wouldn't believe it.

14:58.770 --> 15:00.809
Whatever you say will
receive a fair hearing.

15:00.810 --> 15:03.182
Well, that hasn't
been my experience.

15:05.241 --> 15:07.305
Marie called me
last week in crisis.

15:07.306 --> 15:10.745
She had picked up anomalous
submicrowave bursts

15:10.746 --> 15:12.080
on her radio telescope.

15:12.081 --> 15:14.584
It was not just the background
noises of the universe.

15:14.585 --> 15:17.792
It was a signal coming
from somewhere nearby

15:17.793 --> 15:19.727
with a repetitive pattern.

15:20.033 --> 15:22.909
As in... contact?

15:23.042 --> 15:24.757
Or so she believed.

15:25.650 --> 15:28.808
So she booked more time on
her radio telescope array

15:28.809 --> 15:30.966
and studied that
section of the sky,

15:31.010 --> 15:32.773
which is when the trouble started.

15:33.329 --> 15:34.414
What trouble?

15:35.083 --> 15:36.230
Lost time.

15:36.952 --> 15:39.196
Four hours on Sunday, just gone.

15:39.197 --> 15:41.561
Then she started having
mental flashbacks...

15:41.562 --> 15:44.993
a white room, a blurry
face questioning her.

15:44.994 --> 15:47.809
Are we saying,
Marie was abducted by aliens?

15:47.810 --> 15:50.438
The classic indicators were there.

15:50.697 --> 15:52.480
I just tried to help
her make sense of it.

15:52.481 --> 15:55.681
After Marie called you on Wednesday,
she left the center.

15:55.682 --> 15:56.881
Do you know where she went?

15:56.882 --> 15:59.504
She said she was
gonna get proof of...

15:59.505 --> 16:01.317
What she knew was there.

16:01.930 --> 16:04.157
Proof of aliens? 
And did she?

16:04.361 --> 16:05.957
I never heard from her again.

16:06.201 --> 16:07.895
I assumed they stopped her

16:07.896 --> 16:10.285
before she got too
close to the truth.

16:10.801 --> 16:12.844
Who? The government.

16:12.906 --> 16:15.318
I warned her, she was
probably being followed

16:15.633 --> 16:17.261
by men determined...

16:17.585 --> 16:19.960
To keep the existence
of aliens a secret.

16:19.961 --> 16:21.505
It's like that Will Smith movie,

16:21.506 --> 16:23.183
only I'm guessing
a lot less funny.

16:23.184 --> 16:25.351
These agents are real, Mr. Castle.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.609
They fear the revelation
that we are not alone

16:28.610 --> 16:29.864
would be too shocking.

16:29.865 --> 16:32.983
Hysteria would break out.
Nations would crumble.

16:32.984 --> 16:36.184
That's why they try to
discredit believers like me

16:36.185 --> 16:39.767
and eliminate people who
threaten to expose the truth...

16:39.768 --> 16:41.445
people like Marie.

16:43.833 --> 16:47.109
The bookstore confirms that
Stryker was signing his opus

16:47.110 --> 16:49.402
between 7:00 and 10:00 P.M.

16:49.869 --> 16:51.425
Looks like we're back
to an empty space

16:51.426 --> 16:52.999
in the suspect column.

16:53.019 --> 16:55.622
Yeah, but at least our
timeline is making more sense.

16:56.395 --> 16:59.570
This whole Sunday-ish area,
the life-changing event,

16:59.571 --> 17:01.000
that's when she was abducted.

17:01.001 --> 17:03.415
Wednesday, she leaves work,

17:03.416 --> 17:05.432
that's when she was looking
for proof of alien life.

17:05.433 --> 17:08.112
Thursday, she comes back to work,
feeling better,

17:08.113 --> 17:10.472
until she leaves and winds up...

17:10.473 --> 17:12.580
Explosively decompressed.

17:13.512 --> 17:14.584
Overall, a big week.

17:14.585 --> 17:16.393
You know what this
timeline shows me?

17:16.394 --> 17:20.074
A lot of erratic behavior
that could be due to drug use

17:20.075 --> 17:22.377
or any number of
medical conditions.

17:22.559 --> 17:23.682
All right.

17:24.102 --> 17:25.244
Let's say Marie

17:25.246 --> 17:27.845
is a drug-addled psychotic
with a brain tumor.

17:27.846 --> 17:29.125
She still went looking for proof.

17:29.126 --> 17:30.894
She went looking for what
she thought was proof.

17:30.895 --> 17:32.809
Whatever it was,
what if she found it?

17:33.269 --> 17:34.594
Where would it be?

17:34.662 --> 17:36.942
Come on, Castle.
You don't actually believe

17:36.943 --> 17:39.206
that Klingons are
behind this, do you?

17:39.207 --> 17:41.913
Killer aliens is a reach,
even for me.

17:41.914 --> 17:44.186
But government agents
covering up the truth?

17:44.187 --> 17:45.566
Not so crazy.

17:45.938 --> 17:47.454
Yes, it is.

17:47.515 --> 17:49.208
I mean, when this is
all said and done,

17:49.209 --> 17:52.217
it will all come down to
where and how she was killed.

17:52.218 --> 17:53.961
And I bet it will
have nothing to do

17:53.962 --> 17:57.733
with secret agents or massive
government conspiracies.

17:57.852 --> 17:59.069
I'll take that bet.

18:04.405 --> 18:05.650
Detective.

18:05.996 --> 18:07.557
Where did everything go?

18:07.558 --> 18:10.268
Two men came this morning
with a-a federal warrant.

18:10.269 --> 18:12.971
They loaded all of Marie's
stuff into a truck.

18:12.972 --> 18:15.043
Who were they?
From which agency?

18:15.044 --> 18:17.079
They just said the government.

18:18.918 --> 18:21.330
I'd like my payment in
small bills, please.

18:25.758 --> 18:27.045
My contact at Justice

18:27.046 --> 18:28.957
says no warrant was
issued for Marie's office.

18:28.958 --> 18:31.614
Well, then people claiming
to be federal agents

18:31.615 --> 18:32.789
seized her property.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.700
I mean, there's gotta
be an explanation.

18:34.799 --> 18:36.103
Men in black.

18:36.104 --> 18:37.949
Other than that.
I'll put out more feelers.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.070
Meantime, keep me posted.

18:39.071 --> 18:40.153
Okay, thank you.

18:40.926 --> 18:43.509
Marie found proof,
and they covered it up.

18:43.510 --> 18:45.037
It's just like Benny Stryker said.

18:45.038 --> 18:47.093
Do you honestly expect
me to believe a theory...

18:47.094 --> 18:51.422
any theory... that ends with
"like Benny Stryker said"?

18:51.423 --> 18:54.474
What else could it be?
Who made off with all her stuff?

18:54.559 --> 18:55.861
Maybe Marie was working

18:55.862 --> 18:58.190
on a classified
government project,

18:58.191 --> 18:59.438
and they confiscated her data.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.603
Was her data in her furniture?
Because they took that, too.

19:02.679 --> 19:04.436
Well, without knowing who
"they" are,

19:04.437 --> 19:06.146
we can't find them.

19:08.879 --> 19:10.090
You know...

19:10.117 --> 19:12.265
The key lies in the murder weapon.

19:12.266 --> 19:15.923
Esposito, tell me that you've
located that altitude chamber.

19:15.924 --> 19:17.032
I did...

19:17.300 --> 19:19.338
At the Physics Center
at Hudson University.

19:19.339 --> 19:21.297
It was the only other one
in the five boroughs.

19:21.298 --> 19:22.332
See?

19:22.333 --> 19:23.471
It's clean.

19:23.969 --> 19:25.629
C.S.U. just checked.

19:28.728 --> 19:31.633
Well, there's gotta be another
device that does the same thing.

19:31.634 --> 19:32.999
Lanie and I looked into that.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.528
The only thing we found was
an industrial vacuum packer.

19:36.529 --> 19:38.045
It's used for food processing.

19:38.622 --> 19:40.293
Check into every
single one in town.

19:40.294 --> 19:42.091
We need to locate
that crime scene.

19:42.742 --> 19:43.770
Castle.

19:44.407 --> 19:46.925
Just prove that E.T.
did this, bro, please.

19:46.926 --> 19:48.877
I hunt people, not machines.

19:48.878 --> 19:51.193
I'm working on it. 
Thank you.

19:51.621 --> 19:52.757
Maybe we should focus

19:52.758 --> 19:55.107
on Marie's mystery Wednesday trip.

19:55.959 --> 19:57.998
Castle, finding proof of aliens

19:57.999 --> 20:00.093
will not help us catch our killer.

20:00.094 --> 20:01.119
It will if she went somewhere

20:01.120 --> 20:03.053
with an industrial vacuum packer.

20:03.054 --> 20:06.110
If she did, it was off
the Jersey turnpike.

20:06.111 --> 20:09.161
Her e-zpass account shows
her getting off at exit 9.

20:09.162 --> 20:10.649
Where'd she go from there?
Hard to say.

20:10.650 --> 20:13.254
I checked her credit cards.
No activity in the area.

20:16.011 --> 20:17.146
What are you doing?

20:17.147 --> 20:18.400
I am mapping it.

20:18.401 --> 20:21.124
New Jersey turnpike, exit 9.

20:21.689 --> 20:24.808
Let me share with you the many
wonders that await us at exit 9.

20:24.809 --> 20:26.617
Oh, there's an arts center,

20:26.618 --> 20:30.201
some state park with scenic
hiking trails and canoeing,

20:30.202 --> 20:32.685
an astounding amount of day spas,

20:33.448 --> 20:35.916
and the Plainsboro Observatory.

20:41.815 --> 20:43.915
Yeah, Marie was here on Wednesday.

20:44.735 --> 20:47.021
She said she needed
to use our telescope.

20:47.022 --> 20:49.090
Why would she need this one?

20:49.285 --> 20:51.850
Marie usually worked
with a radio telescope.

20:52.078 --> 20:53.564
This is an optical telescope.

20:53.565 --> 20:56.855
So she came here to get a visual
on something up there in space?

20:56.963 --> 20:59.243
She said she picked
up signal anomalies.

20:59.244 --> 21:00.866
She wanted to see where
they were coming from.

21:00.867 --> 21:03.713
She took an image capture,
then she left.

21:03.714 --> 21:05.210
Could we get a copy of that image?

21:05.211 --> 21:08.674
I checked the telescope's hard drive.
She erased everything.

21:08.675 --> 21:11.695
Coordinates, the image capture...
It's all gone.

21:12.476 --> 21:13.778
She erased everything.

21:13.779 --> 21:15.738
What the hell did
she see up there?

21:15.739 --> 21:18.834
Marie Subbarao,
a sober-minded scientist

21:18.835 --> 21:21.067
believes she was
abducted by aliens

21:21.068 --> 21:24.217
after intercepting
strange radio signals.

21:24.218 --> 21:25.306
Using a telescope,

21:25.307 --> 21:27.689
she photographs the
source of the signal.

21:27.690 --> 21:30.538
The next day, dies mysteriously.

21:30.539 --> 21:34.519
Then her office is raided by
shadowy government agents.

21:35.139 --> 21:37.642
I'm not asking you
to dye your hair red

21:37.643 --> 21:38.793
and call me Mulder.

21:38.794 --> 21:41.849
I would simply ask that you
consider the possibility

21:41.850 --> 21:44.313
that Marie had knowledge of

21:44.314 --> 21:47.662
or made contact with
something up there...

21:47.785 --> 21:51.239
That somehow led to her death.

21:51.890 --> 21:54.250
We will continue our investigation

21:54.251 --> 21:56.033
and solve this case,

21:56.034 --> 22:00.018
and it will have nothing to
do with little green men.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.096
They're gray, actually.

22:01.097 --> 22:05.031
Castle, the truth...the real truth...
is out there.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.631
Dead battery?

22:16.754 --> 22:18.711
Maintenance just replaced it.

22:20.010 --> 22:21.542
My phone isn't working.

22:22.057 --> 22:23.138
Mine isn't either.

22:23.139 --> 22:24.407
Neither is my watch.

22:26.051 --> 22:29.823
You have a logical explanation
for this, too, right?

22:55.759 --> 22:58.251
Marie Subbarao had information...

22:58.359 --> 22:59.995
Information we need.

23:00.007 --> 23:01.298
Where's Beckett?

23:04.820 --> 23:06.255
Who are you?

23:09.172 --> 23:10.408
Where's Castle?

23:11.812 --> 23:14.440
I am an NYPD detective.

23:16.107 --> 23:17.319
Where is it?

23:17.693 --> 23:18.890
Where's what?

23:18.891 --> 23:21.483
We all know what Marie Subbarao
was involved with, detective.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.203
That information must not get out.

23:23.204 --> 23:24.691
Yeah, but we don't have it.

23:25.175 --> 23:26.384
Where is it?

23:26.467 --> 23:27.654
Is this the part
where you bring out

23:27.655 --> 23:29.850
the old Nazi with
the dentist drill?

23:31.126 --> 23:32.462
If you don't cooperate,

23:32.463 --> 23:34.363
we'll find a way to
get at the truth.

23:35.366 --> 23:38.110
We'll do whatever it takes
to protect our way of life.

23:38.111 --> 23:39.466
From what?

23:39.831 --> 23:43.165
A woman who thought that
she was abducted by aliens?

23:43.166 --> 23:44.670
You're out of your league,
detective.

23:44.671 --> 23:46.979
You have no idea how deep this is.

23:47.142 --> 23:48.434
Now where is it?

23:48.934 --> 23:50.237
Who are you?

23:50.238 --> 23:52.110
Identify yourself.

23:52.111 --> 23:55.378
What, CIA, NSA...

23:55.510 --> 23:56.714
M.I.B?

23:58.391 --> 24:01.029
Shape-shifting aliens
that only look human?

24:01.030 --> 24:03.166
Who killed Marie Subbarao?

24:03.167 --> 24:05.262
If you keep asking
questions you shouldn't,

24:05.263 --> 24:06.954
you may end up like Marie.

24:07.838 --> 24:09.178
Who killed her?

24:09.533 --> 24:11.379
No one you could ever reach.

24:13.782 --> 24:15.763
What about J.F.K.?

24:16.158 --> 24:18.299
Was it the second shooter
on the grassy knoll?

24:18.522 --> 24:20.442
Third shooter backed by mafia?

24:20.443 --> 24:22.814
Castro? Mafia and Castro?

24:24.947 --> 24:27.878
Okay, whatever you
guys are looking for,

24:28.107 --> 24:29.710
we don't know where it is.

24:29.933 --> 24:31.477
Come on. No, dude.

24:31.478 --> 24:32.889
Come on. Don't. Don't. Ah!

24:33.967 --> 24:35.034
No.

24:52.369 --> 24:53.877
Are you okay?

24:56.778 --> 24:58.949
Castle, did that really happen?

24:59.473 --> 25:00.740
Do I have a...

25:02.058 --> 25:03.037
Oh, no.

25:05.449 --> 25:06.845
'Cause you got a...

25:18.248 --> 25:19.608
This is outrageous.

25:19.609 --> 25:21.945
An illegal detention
of an NYPD detective?

25:21.946 --> 25:23.575
Who says the government
is unresponsive?

25:23.576 --> 25:26.040
They're all over this alien cover-up.
Who are these men?

25:26.041 --> 25:27.919
Agents of some sort.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.450
They probably are the ones who
cleared out Marie's office.

25:30.451 --> 25:32.658
Well, I'm glad you two are all right,
but no one snatches up

25:32.659 --> 25:34.862
my people and detains 'em.
I'll get into this.

25:35.598 --> 25:37.547
Those men knew who killed Marie,

25:37.548 --> 25:39.234
and they refused to tell us.

25:39.235 --> 25:41.207
They also refused to confirm
that J. Edgar Hoover

25:41.208 --> 25:42.671
liked to wear dresses.

25:42.672 --> 25:46.428
Hmm. Abducted by government agents,
huh? Come on.

25:46.655 --> 25:48.396
What were you two really doing?

25:48.431 --> 25:50.871
It's not a hickey, Esposito.
You both have one.

25:50.872 --> 25:54.005
I wish it was a hickey.
It's from the injectors.

25:54.006 --> 25:55.317
Is that what the kids are
calling it these days?

25:55.318 --> 25:57.349
They were men in black.

25:57.350 --> 25:59.033
Where are you with
the vacuum packers?

25:59.034 --> 26:02.337
So far, I have found over a hundred
machines in the five boroughs.

26:02.338 --> 26:03.941
C.S.U.'s checking 'em
as fast as they can.

26:03.942 --> 26:05.017
And the cigarettes?

26:05.018 --> 26:07.929
No D.N.A. match,
but they are a Chinese brand

26:07.930 --> 26:10.625
only found in Asia or on the
black market in Chinatown.

26:10.626 --> 26:12.328
So maybe she was
killed by an alien,

26:12.329 --> 26:14.493
just an illegal alien.

26:14.494 --> 26:15.770
Hey.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.741
Those hickeys? 
Yes.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.044
No.
I wish.

26:19.045 --> 26:22.149
Okay. So tech just went
through your vehicle.

26:22.150 --> 26:23.741
Turns out you were
hit with an E.M.P....

26:23.742 --> 26:27.453
an electromagnetic pulse...
which knocked out all the electronics.

26:27.454 --> 26:29.842
And here's how they found
you in the first place.

26:30.525 --> 26:33.346
Tracers, listening devices...

26:33.558 --> 26:35.199
They must have been
watching the science center.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.055
That's when they put these
accessories in my car.

26:38.056 --> 26:39.614
Maybe that's what
was up Marie's nose.

26:39.615 --> 26:41.257
Perhaps they were
tracking her, too.

26:41.258 --> 26:43.064
No, it wasn't a
tracer or an implant.

26:43.065 --> 26:44.826
Lanie identified
it as aspergillus.

26:44.827 --> 26:47.121
It's a rare calcification
resulting from

26:47.122 --> 26:48.386
a sinus infection.

26:48.387 --> 26:51.418
The calcification is so dense,
it reads like metal.

26:51.419 --> 26:53.865
There you go. Logical explanation.

26:53.866 --> 26:57.006
Yeah. I would disguise my tracking
implants as a rare medical

26:57.007 --> 26:58.903
you know, the bottom
line is that these guys

26:58.904 --> 27:01.798
were desperate to get
whatever Marie took,

27:01.799 --> 27:03.255
so we gotta find it first,

27:03.256 --> 27:05.223
because that'll lead
us to the killer.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.383
Yeah, but we really don't
know what we're looking for.

27:07.384 --> 27:09.304
But we do know that
they don't have it.

27:09.305 --> 27:11.071
Which means it wasn't
in Marie's office.

27:11.072 --> 27:12.722
She maybe hid it somewhere.

27:12.975 --> 27:15.938
Maybe with someone she trusted,
somebody under the radar.

27:16.255 --> 27:18.029
Ted Carter said
that Marie gave him

27:18.030 --> 27:20.526
some of his stuff back
last Wednesday night.

27:20.527 --> 27:22.317
Maybe that's not all she gave him.

27:26.631 --> 27:27.608
I don't understand.

27:27.609 --> 27:30.655
It's just books and
T-shirts mostly.

27:30.656 --> 27:31.822
Mr. Carter, did you notice

27:31.823 --> 27:34.135
anything different in the
things that she gave you,

27:34.136 --> 27:35.863
anything that wasn't there before?

27:35.864 --> 27:37.622
No, it's all my stuff.

27:37.623 --> 27:40.907
It's just T-shirts,
Jefferson Starship CD...

27:41.479 --> 27:43.045
Oh! This CD got me
through two weeks

27:43.046 --> 27:44.682
of "Storm Watch" writer's block.

27:46.183 --> 27:48.634
I don't remember it
being a 2-disc set.

27:49.045 --> 27:50.921
This one's unmarked.

27:51.078 --> 27:52.634
Marie's proof perhaps?

27:54.420 --> 27:56.663
Oh, oh, oh, no, wait.

27:58.411 --> 27:59.472
That's it?

27:59.987 --> 28:01.698
I mean, no pomp, no circumstance?

28:01.699 --> 28:04.516
What's on this could shake
the very foundations

28:04.517 --> 28:05.731
of our existence.

28:05.732 --> 28:08.627
We need to pause and savor...

28:08.628 --> 28:12.208
Please. Let's just stick it
in and get this over with.

28:13.659 --> 28:14.905
I mean, the fact of the matter is,

28:14.906 --> 28:17.706
there's probably nothing
of any value on that CD...

28:17.707 --> 28:19.631
To our investigati...

28:26.360 --> 28:27.608
You were saying?

28:31.578 --> 28:32.880
No way.

28:36.712 --> 28:40.047
Behold this image,
gentlemen and lady.

28:40.428 --> 28:42.715
We are witness to
a stunning event...

28:42.716 --> 28:45.002
a turning point in human history...

28:45.003 --> 28:48.443
the moment we knew...
We were not alone.

28:48.444 --> 28:50.647
For who can deny that this...

28:51.484 --> 28:53.641
Is an alien spacecraft?

28:57.594 --> 28:58.970
It does kinda look like one.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.544
Yeah, but this image?

29:00.545 --> 29:03.559
I mean, it's gotta be doctored.
Right, Beckett?

29:04.106 --> 29:06.509
I don't know. 
Whoa.

29:06.795 --> 29:08.111
What are you saying?

29:08.283 --> 29:10.758
Are you saying,
you think that this is real?

29:11.490 --> 29:12.598
Well...

29:12.915 --> 29:14.545
It doesn't look doctored.

29:14.546 --> 29:17.498
Okay, just for clarity,
so we know later who said what,

29:17.499 --> 29:19.226
you are conceding

29:19.227 --> 29:21.255
that it is a possibility

29:21.778 --> 29:24.775
that this is an alien spaceship?

29:28.642 --> 29:30.024
What I am saying

29:30.025 --> 29:33.514
is that we now know what
these agents were after.

29:33.515 --> 29:34.529
That close. 
Yeah.

29:34.530 --> 29:35.889
And as far as I'm concerned,

29:35.890 --> 29:37.497
let a higher pay
grade deal with it.

29:37.498 --> 29:40.906
We now have leverage that we can
use with our mystery agents.

29:40.907 --> 29:44.229
How? It's not like we can
just call 'em up? Mm.

29:45.594 --> 29:48.726
W... uh, we do have a box of bugs.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.455
It's the next best
thing to a batphone.

29:59.336 --> 30:02.875
We have what you want.
You know where we are.

30:07.094 --> 30:08.519
You really think
that's gonna work?

30:20.112 --> 30:21.313
Please take a seat.

30:21.936 --> 30:23.060
So where is it?

30:23.087 --> 30:24.132
Not a chance.

30:26.496 --> 30:28.083
I want something in return...

30:29.447 --> 30:32.081
The name of Marie
Subbarao's killer.

30:32.944 --> 30:34.081
Ladies first.

30:42.326 --> 30:43.851
Why are you showing me this?

30:43.852 --> 30:46.578
It's the photo that Marie
took from the observatory

30:46.579 --> 30:47.269
of the alien ship.

30:47.820 --> 30:49.173
I'll be on my way now.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.001
Wait a minute. We had a deal.

30:51.512 --> 30:55.000
You said you had what I want.
As it happens, you don't.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.317
You're not leaving.
Marie Subbarao was murdered

30:58.318 --> 31:00.301
in the most awful way imaginable,

31:00.302 --> 31:02.086
and her killer is still out there.

31:02.516 --> 31:05.118
You owe it to her.
Give us that name.

31:05.119 --> 31:06.869
Maybe she isn't who
you think she is.

31:06.870 --> 31:08.455
What's that supposed to mean?

31:08.941 --> 31:10.562
I mean, if it's not this,
then what?

31:10.563 --> 31:13.797
Why all of this fuss
over an astrophysicist

31:13.798 --> 31:16.170
who analyzes radio signals?

31:16.171 --> 31:18.422
Unless what she
analyzed was secret.

31:18.423 --> 31:20.677
That's it, isn't it?

31:20.678 --> 31:22.689
She intercepted
classified information.

31:22.690 --> 31:24.752
Yeah, you did say that
she took something

31:24.753 --> 31:27.492
that was vital to our security.

31:27.493 --> 31:30.445
And we found Chinese
cigarettes at the crime scene.

31:30.446 --> 31:32.461
Was she working with the Chinese?

31:32.896 --> 31:34.681
Look, either you tell
us the truth now,

31:34.683 --> 31:36.897
or we take what we
know to the media.

31:36.898 --> 31:39.494
What makes you think they'll print it? 
Oh, they probably won't.

31:40.121 --> 31:42.373
But I know more than a
dozen bloggers who will.

31:42.374 --> 31:43.813
Not to mention over half a million

31:43.814 --> 31:45.831
of my own followers on Twitter.

31:53.059 --> 31:55.657
Nothing I say can leave this room.

31:55.895 --> 31:57.294
You have our word on that.

31:57.295 --> 32:00.322
Last month, we determined
that an enemy operative

32:00.323 --> 32:03.392
had intercepted classified,
coded data streams

32:03.393 --> 32:05.596
between the Pacific
fleet and the Pentagon.

32:05.989 --> 32:07.261
You think it was Marie.

32:07.262 --> 32:09.456
The intercepted
transmissions coincided

32:09.457 --> 32:12.303
with Marie's tasking
her radio telescope

32:12.304 --> 32:14.204
to point at our satellite,

32:14.205 --> 32:16.041
which was nowhere
near where she was

32:16.042 --> 32:18.151
supposed to be doing her research.

32:18.152 --> 32:20.542
So that wasn't a photo of a UFO.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.216
That was your spy satellite.

32:22.217 --> 32:25.005
But the real damage done
is the data she downloaded,

32:25.006 --> 32:27.387
which I fear is now in
the hands of the Chinese.

32:27.388 --> 32:30.612
So then who killed her?
Her handler, I imagine.

32:30.613 --> 32:33.146
The Chinese must have
known we were on to them.

32:33.191 --> 32:34.187
They were smart enough

32:34.188 --> 32:35.441
to make it look like
the boyfriend did it.

32:35.442 --> 32:37.250
Who's this handler?

32:38.817 --> 32:41.111
Someone from Chinese intelligence.

32:41.615 --> 32:43.515
We were never able
to identify him.

32:44.006 --> 32:47.210
Whoever he is,
you'll never catch him.

32:47.293 --> 32:48.530
It's over.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.828
It's never over.

32:51.021 --> 32:53.700
In the book,
I take a bold new look

32:53.701 --> 32:56.074
at the linear
aggregation of markets.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.795
It's about time someone did.

32:57.796 --> 33:00.596
So Ashley tells me
you're an author as well.

33:00.597 --> 33:02.811
Tell me about your writing,
Mr. Castle.

33:02.812 --> 33:04.498
I don't read popular fiction.

33:04.499 --> 33:07.200
I find most of it
crass and tawdry.

33:07.812 --> 33:09.657
Yes. Right.

33:09.658 --> 33:11.461
Well, I, uh...

33:13.525 --> 33:14.533
I think of my writing

33:14.534 --> 33:17.871
as character studies
in human behavior,

33:17.921 --> 33:20.556
looking into the heart of
what makes people tick.

33:20.557 --> 33:23.309
For instance, what would
make an ordinary person,

33:23.310 --> 33:24.272
like yourself,

33:24.273 --> 33:26.833
commit an act that's
unusually heinous

33:26.834 --> 33:28.077
or some...

33:29.216 --> 33:31.228
Out of character...

33:33.954 --> 33:36.435
Would you excuse me

33:36.489 --> 33:38.622
for a-a moment?

33:40.212 --> 33:40.866
Beckett.

33:40.867 --> 33:43.047
Marie was acting out of character.

33:43.048 --> 33:45.073
What self-respecting
espionage agent

33:45.074 --> 33:46.241
would act strangely

33:46.242 --> 33:47.546
and risk blowing her cover?

33:47.547 --> 33:49.461
Maybe she wasn't the real spy.

33:49.462 --> 33:50.861
Well, that might explain
the test results

33:50.862 --> 33:52.451
that Lanie just sent over.

33:52.769 --> 33:56.188
Marie had traces of sodium
pentothal in her system.

33:56.189 --> 33:58.165
Somebody gave her truth serum?

33:58.561 --> 34:02.054
Maybe it was the real spy.
The white room, the questions...

34:02.055 --> 34:04.417
That's why Stryker thought
she was abducted by aliens.

34:04.418 --> 34:06.060
Well, if Marie wasn't the spy...

34:06.061 --> 34:08.637
Then the real spy is
someone with access

34:08.638 --> 34:10.792
to that radio telescope
at the science center.

34:10.793 --> 34:12.462
I'm heading over there right now.

34:12.463 --> 34:14.043
I'll meet you there
as soon as I can.

34:15.641 --> 34:17.274
More wine?

34:17.645 --> 34:19.924
Got another request here,
redirecting the telescope

34:19.925 --> 34:21.047
to the satellite coordinates.

34:21.047 --> 34:23.614
Signed by Marie,
just like all the others.

34:23.668 --> 34:25.297
Well, out of character or not,

34:25.299 --> 34:27.674
it looks like she was
the spy after all.

34:29.293 --> 34:30.268
Wait a minute.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.235
These two signatures
are different.

34:34.237 --> 34:37.297
The... the A's don't match.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.650
You're right.

34:42.592 --> 34:45.873
And look who else makes an
"a" like that?

34:46.150 --> 34:47.739
"Dr. Charles Vaughn."

34:47.741 --> 34:50.824
He forged her signatures
to make it look as though

34:50.826 --> 34:53.851
Marie was the one intercepting
the satellite transmissions.

34:53.851 --> 34:57.852
So maybe Marie saw a request
with her fake signature,

34:57.853 --> 34:59.679
and she got curious.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.700
So she put in a request of her own

35:01.701 --> 35:03.849
to have the telescope
scan that part of the sky.

35:03.850 --> 35:06.028
So that's when she intercepted
the weird signals.

35:06.029 --> 35:07.819
After that, she lost time.

35:07.820 --> 35:09.940
And then when she told
Benny Stryker about it,

35:09.941 --> 35:12.244
he assumed that she
had been abducted...

35:12.245 --> 35:15.584
Which she had been,
only not by aliens, by Dr. Vaughn,

35:15.585 --> 35:18.001
who drugged her to figure
out how much she knew.

35:18.002 --> 35:19.177
When he realized
how close she was,

35:19.178 --> 35:20.851
he got rid of her.
Yeah, but he's the one

35:20.852 --> 35:22.903
who told us about the
altitude chamber.

35:22.904 --> 35:25.525
Yeah, because he knew it would
lead us to Marie's ex-boyfriend.

35:25.526 --> 35:28.170
Dr. Vaughn is gone.
He's not at his place.

35:28.171 --> 35:31.321
But you know what is?
Three vials of sodium pentothal.

35:31.322 --> 35:34.816
Any idea where he went? 
No, but it looks like he left in a rush.

35:34.817 --> 35:37.393
Call T.S.A. and have him
put on a no-fly list,

35:37.394 --> 35:40.321
and keep me posted.
He's on the run.

35:40.322 --> 35:41.900
If he heard we asked for
those request forms,

35:41.901 --> 35:43.059
he would've been tipped off.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.558
He probably had an
escape plan in place,

35:45.559 --> 35:47.394
just in case his cover was blown.

35:47.395 --> 35:49.748
And Chinese handlers who can
smuggle him out of the country.

35:49.749 --> 35:50.628
Not to be negative,

35:50.629 --> 35:52.850
but the odds of catching
this guy are not great.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.088
Unless we enlist the help of
a certain government agent

35:56.089 --> 35:58.338
who wants him just
as bad as we do.

36:07.442 --> 36:10.161
I may want to put you guys on
my friends and family plan.

36:10.162 --> 36:12.988
We now believe that Dr. Vaughn is the spy.

36:12.989 --> 36:15.228
Marie figured it out,
and then he killed her.

36:15.229 --> 36:16.892
I'm inclined to agree,

36:16.954 --> 36:19.306
which leaves the agency
with some egg on its face.

36:19.307 --> 36:21.370
And which agency did
you say that was again?

36:21.371 --> 36:24.163
I didn't.
We dug deeper on Dr. Vaughn.

36:24.172 --> 36:26.392
Turns out he has a
fondness for gambling.

36:26.393 --> 36:28.879
He ran up quite the tab
at an Atlantic City casino

36:28.880 --> 36:30.761
controlled by the Chinese.
After that,

36:30.762 --> 36:33.540
they owned him.
Do you know where Dr. Vaughn is now?

36:33.541 --> 36:35.249
I know where to start looking.

36:36.106 --> 36:38.663
Using his cell phone number,
I can triangulate his position.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.832
Well, he's gotta be worried
about being tracked.

36:40.833 --> 36:42.397
He probably turned it off.

36:42.398 --> 36:45.452
Then we'll just turn it back on.
You can do that?

36:45.522 --> 36:47.466
We turned off your phones,
didn't we?

36:47.467 --> 36:48.938
Yeah, and the car.

36:50.336 --> 36:52.828
He's in the warehouse
district in Chinatown.

36:52.829 --> 36:54.537
1400 block of Canal Street.

36:54.538 --> 36:55.786
Could we get a closer look?

36:55.787 --> 36:58.928
There he is. 
Fancy.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.650
That's just a few blocks
away from where we found

37:00.651 --> 37:03.593
Marie's body. 
Maybe that's where he killed her.

37:03.594 --> 37:06.124
And who is that guy? 
Oh, wait.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.152
He's the cigarette-smoking man.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.715
Otherwise known as Ung Kyu.

37:12.716 --> 37:14.816
He's a high-level Chinese
Intelligence agent.

37:14.817 --> 37:17.992
So our murder suspect
is meeting his handler.

37:17.993 --> 37:19.943
Which means Dr. Vaughn
may still have the data.

37:19.944 --> 37:21.613
Well, then let's go get him.

37:23.170 --> 37:24.442
Where are the predator drones,

37:24.443 --> 37:25.532
the black helicopters,

37:25.533 --> 37:27.447
all those S.W.A.T.
teams rappelling down on ropes?

37:27.448 --> 37:30.796
Budget cuts. It's vital
to our national security

37:30.797 --> 37:32.461
that we take these men alive.

37:33.127 --> 37:35.030
These guys are trained agents.
They probably have

37:35.031 --> 37:37.030
cyanide capsules in their
teeth in case they're caught.

37:37.031 --> 37:39.285
We'll worry about their
teeth when the time comes.

37:39.286 --> 37:41.074
Patrol cars have
closed off all streets

37:41.075 --> 37:43.488
in a 5-block radius.
And air support's on the way.

37:43.489 --> 37:45.560
All right. What's the plan?

37:45.566 --> 37:47.510
Vaughn's cell phone
signal has gone dark,

37:47.511 --> 37:50.168
which means he's underground.
According to our intel,

37:50.169 --> 37:51.814
this building has an
extensive basement

37:51.815 --> 37:53.819
with two methods of ingress.
Actually,

37:53.820 --> 37:55.413
most of the basements
on this side of town

37:55.414 --> 37:58.007
are linked through doorways
used as escape routes

37:58.008 --> 37:59.915
for illegals in case
of an I.N.S. raid.

37:59.916 --> 38:02.521
So you're saying that
Vaughn and Kyu could be

38:02.522 --> 38:04.981
in either of the adjoining
buildings as well?

38:05.222 --> 38:06.773
Welcome to New York.

38:07.048 --> 38:08.368
Let's go.

38:20.756 --> 38:22.937
NYPD. Stay where you are.
Oh!

38:23.218 --> 38:25.018
That's a vacuum packer at 1:00.

38:26.529 --> 38:28.655
Looks like we found
our murder weapon.

38:30.532 --> 38:31.928
Have you seen this man?

38:43.586 --> 38:45.115
Go, go.

38:47.507 --> 38:48.839
Semester abroad?

38:48.886 --> 38:50.277
Nah, a TV show I used to love.

38:50.278 --> 38:51.225
Ah. Nice job.

38:51.226 --> 38:52.533
Thanks.

39:15.264 --> 39:16.863
Get on your knees.

39:17.122 --> 39:18.800
No. Wait! Please!

39:19.015 --> 39:21.829
I-I got rid of Marie.
I did everything you asked.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.483
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I can still help you.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.265
Wait. Wait, wait.

39:29.266 --> 39:31.155
Mnh-mnh. 
Please. No, I can still help you. Please.

39:31.156 --> 39:32.976
NYPD! Drop that gun.

39:33.410 --> 39:34.828
Oh!

39:37.666 --> 39:39.293
On the ground. Now.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.156
Cyanide capsule!

39:57.591 --> 40:01.292
Ew! Gum. False alarm.

40:01.293 --> 40:02.803
Where is the data?

40:02.911 --> 40:07.141
In a... U.S.B.
drive in his pocket.

40:11.677 --> 40:13.419
Think we'll get a medal for this?

40:13.519 --> 40:15.208
This never happened.

40:19.951 --> 40:22.240
Guess that means I can't
put this on Twitter.

40:28.733 --> 40:30.336
Vaughn's already
spilling his guts.

40:30.337 --> 40:32.973
Yeah, a near execution will
shake your loyalties like that.

40:32.974 --> 40:35.032
Between his confession and
the espionage charges,

40:35.033 --> 40:37.025
he and Ung Kyu will spend
the rest of their lives

40:37.026 --> 40:38.734
in federal prison, thanks to you.

40:38.765 --> 40:42.609
And to Castle.
Yes, and Mr. Castle.

40:42.799 --> 40:44.945
Might I have a private word
with Detective Beckett?

40:44.946 --> 40:46.036
Of course.

40:50.403 --> 40:54.632
Hey, sweetie. Look, um,
about the parental review.

40:54.633 --> 40:57.117
I failed, and I know,
and I'm... I'm sorry.

40:57.223 --> 40:58.509
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:58.510 --> 41:01.346
They... they found me fascinating?

41:02.745 --> 41:04.918
Camping with you...
They want to go camping with us?

41:04.919 --> 41:08.393
No. No, no, it's...
No, that... Yeah, that'd be great.

41:08.939 --> 41:10.577
That'd be so much fun.

41:11.514 --> 41:12.674
Mm-hmm.

41:13.092 --> 41:15.457
I love you, too. Bye.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.694
So what'd he tell you?

41:18.939 --> 41:21.343
Uh, he told me something
in confidence.

41:21.595 --> 41:22.756
What?

41:24.161 --> 41:25.632
Well, I wish I could
tell you, Castle,

41:25.633 --> 41:27.786
but it was classified.

41:28.949 --> 41:30.928
Well, what did he tell
you that was classified?

41:30.929 --> 41:33.532
Was it about aliens?
The truth about UFOs?

41:33.533 --> 41:34.698
Are you gonna tell me

41:34.699 --> 41:35.371
or you just gonna
make me keep guessing?

41:35.372 --> 41:37.406
I don't know. This guessing
thing is kinda fun.

41:37.407 --> 41:39.564
- All right. Was it about what 
happened at Roswell? - No.

41:39.565 --> 41:40.704
Area 51?
 No.

41:40.705 --> 41:42.198
Loch ness monster is real? 
Yeah.

41:42.199 --> 41:43.231
Really?! 
No.

41:43.232 --> 41:47.157
- Ah. You had me. They're
controlling the weather? - No.

41:47.158 --> 41:48.592
Our thoughts? 
No.

41:48.593 --> 41:51.990
Our buying habits? 
Actually, speaking of shopping,

41:51.991 --> 41:54.323
I read this really interesting...
