- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Can we just start over?

00:06.400 --> 00:07.594
- Wait. 
- Don't you want to?

00:07.760 --> 00:09.193
No.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.068
- Ryan.
- Theresa.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.310
- You ever think about coming home?
- Sometimes.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.118
I know I shouldn't be here.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.668
Would you like to come in?

00:16.840 --> 00:19.513
It's always been you, Summer.
You're undeniable.

00:19.800 --> 00:24.032
I'm a man now. I had sex with a girl.
Summer, to be more specific.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.918
Hi, Marissa. Theresa.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.551
Okay. Bye.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.718
So you and Marissa, you guys broken up?
You guys taking a break? What's the deal?

00:43.880 --> 00:46.838
I don't know.
We're just not seeing each other.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.879
Except you will see each other, at school
every day for the next couple years.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.794
Right. Well, we'll just
go back to being friends.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.030
When were you guys ever friends?

00:57.200 --> 01:01.352
Was it when you were beating up her
boyfriend? Or spooning in a Tijuana motel?

01:01.520 --> 01:04.432
- Is that when you were friends?
- Doesn't mean we can't be friends.

01:04.599 --> 01:05.919
I don't know.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.588
Think I'll see her today?

01:07.760 --> 01:08.909
Friends, Coop?

01:09.080 --> 01:12.789
What are you guys gonna do together?
Lift weights? Try on wife-beaters?

01:12.960 --> 01:15.474
Sorry. Guys like Ryan
aren't friends with girls.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.712
I don't wanna just be his friend.
But after the whole Oliver thing...

01:18.880 --> 01:21.838
...I guess I need to show him
he can trust me.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.520
Who knows if he'll
even wanna be friends.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.911
- So how goes it with Seth?
- Weird.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.719
In public, he's like this huge geek
who mumbles.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.236
I don't even know what he's saying half
the time. But behind closed doors...

01:34.400 --> 01:37.312
...underneath the sheets,
he's like the anti-Cohen.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.198
You think I'll have to see him today?

01:39.360 --> 01:41.999
I think me and Summer are finally
over the hump, by the way.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.435
So to speak. I just hope, man...

01:44.600 --> 01:47.319
...that she can keep it in her trousers
when she sees me today.

01:47.480 --> 01:50.153
She'll probably have her little paws
all over me.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.359
That's probably her now,
a little phone sex.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.916
Who do I know from the 909?

01:56.080 --> 01:57.832
Nobody.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.554
- Hello?
- <i>Ryan?</i>

02:00.720 --> 02:02.517
Hi, it's Theresa.

02:02.680 --> 02:06.434
- Yeah, Seth's mom gave me this number.
- Hey. How are you? Everything okay?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.396
Yeah, fine.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.632
- I'm actually coming out there today.
- You are? How come?

02:11.800 --> 02:14.758
- I mean, for work?
- Yeah...

02:14.920 --> 02:17.150
...but they can't make us
work all the time, right?

02:17.320 --> 02:20.995
- I was thinking we could hang out tonight.
- Tonight? Sure.

02:21.280 --> 02:25.512
- Don't sound so excited.
- I am. I'm just a little surprised, that's all.

02:25.680 --> 02:28.831
Oh, you know me, full of surprises.
So I'll come by after dinner.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.956
Yeah, sounds good. See you then.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.879
Hey, baby. Who's that?

02:33.040 --> 02:34.871
Wrong number.

02:37.280 --> 02:40.556
That was Theresa.
She's in town, wants to hang out.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.631
As a friend.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.350
Well, first Marissa, then Theresa.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.511
Who knew Ryan Atwood was so friendly?

03:28.120 --> 03:29.792
- Summer.
- Cohen.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.757
- Ryan.
- Hi.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.358
- Summer. Can we talk?
- Hey, Brad, what's up?

03:35.520 --> 03:36.714
Brad.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.519
Dude, I didn't recognize you
out of the Speedo.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.473
Not that I'd recognize you
in a Speedo, but...

03:42.640 --> 03:44.949
Okay. Come on.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.118
Jeez.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.392
- So how are you?
- I'm...

03:55.520 --> 03:57.715
I'm late. See you.

04:00.160 --> 04:03.550
So we're doing a fundraiser for the team,
a kissing booth.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.154
I'm gonna be the guy,
and we're looking for a girl...

04:06.320 --> 04:09.153
...who's comfortable being paid
to make out with a bunch of guys.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.471
- Naturally, I thought of you.
- Really? You thought of me?

04:12.720 --> 04:15.632
God. Totally. I mean, why not?

04:15.800 --> 04:17.313
- Thanks, Summer.
- Sure.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.637
He talked to you like I wasn't there.
Does he know we're going out?

04:20.800 --> 04:22.518
It's not like he wants to kiss me.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.513
He just wants me to kiss
a bunch of other dudes for money.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.671
I'll see you tonight. My place?

04:27.840 --> 04:29.239
You can help me practice.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.871
- Anna.
- So you guys are together now?

04:35.040 --> 04:37.918
Well, that didn't take long, did it?

04:38.080 --> 04:39.513
Yeah, Summer and I are...

04:39.680 --> 04:41.033
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.033
I mean, I did see it coming.
It's the reason I broke up with you.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.474
- Hey, how was Pittsburgh?
- It was good to be home.

04:48.640 --> 04:52.349
Pittsburgh's also the home
of Andy Warhol, Mr. Rogers and ketchup.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.272
- You can't compete with that.
- You can't.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.552
Yeah, it was really great.
I got a tuna melt at my favorite diner...

04:57.720 --> 05:00.280
...and I saw <i>Some Kind of Wonderful</i>
at the midnight movie...

05:00.440 --> 05:03.273
...and hung out with all my friends.
It was really nice.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.829
Guess I didn't realize
how much I missed them.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.431
Hey, Dad.
You wanted to see me?

05:09.680 --> 05:11.875
Kiki, we got a problem.

05:12.120 --> 05:15.317
- Uncle Shaun was arrested last night.
- You're kidding. For what?

05:15.480 --> 05:18.119
He was drunk, stumbled into
another guest's room at the St. Regis.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.949
He's been stumbling around drunk
since you met him...

05:21.120 --> 05:24.078
...which was in a bar.
I'll have someone in Legal handle it.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.277
- I was thinking you might ask Sandy.
- Very funny.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.238
He knows people at the DA's office.
He can make this go away.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.152
- He'll never do it.
- Why not?

05:32.320 --> 05:35.073
- Because it would be a favor to me?
- Pretty much. Yeah.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.435
You could tell him
it would mean a lot to you.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.310
Actually, it would mean a lot to me.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.948
But if you want Sandy's help
after all these years...

05:43.120 --> 05:47.238
...then you need to ask him,
because that would mean a lot to Sandy.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.635
- No.
- You should see these two guys.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.678
- Oh, come on.
- Honestly, it was unbelievable.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.159
I swear to God.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.356
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.032
So this is you and Summer
being a couple?

06:04.640 --> 06:06.915
- Ain't love grand?
- I can really sense the bond.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.231
It's like, your closeness,
it's overwhelming.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.958
Oh, my gosh. Wait.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.190
Is it last fall already?

06:14.360 --> 06:17.670
- Come on, she's totally ignoring you.
- Anna, she's not ignoring me.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.594
Summer just has her priorities in order.
You know how she feels about charity.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.519
- Yes?
- Yeah. Good luck with that.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.877
Mrs. Cooper.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.759
- What are you doing here?
- Parent-teacher conference.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.435
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.117
Really good. You... I mean...
God, you look good.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.875
Luke, I'm Marissa's mother.
You're a student at this school.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.831
- We can't do this.
- You mean it's over?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.797
No, I mean in the hallway.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.712
I'll see you tonight.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.759
- Hey, Julie.
- Jimmy, hi.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.150
- You remember Luke.
- Who could forget?

07:09.320 --> 07:10.799
- Luke.
- Hey, Mr. Cooper.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.714
I'm glad you're here. I didn't want to go
to Dr. Kim's office alone. She scares me.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.077
Okay, well, goodbye, Mrs. Cooper.
And Mr. Cooper.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.553
I'll see you.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.278
Both.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.551
Have a good day.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.559
Hey, I'm sorry about this morning.
That...

07:35.720 --> 07:37.915
- It shouldn't have to be...
- Like this?

07:39.040 --> 07:41.713
I was just sort of hoping
we could be friends, you know?

07:41.880 --> 07:45.111
- I mean, as long as that's okay with you.
- Yeah. No, we should hang out.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.069
Okay.
What are you doing tonight?

07:48.520 --> 07:51.557
- Tonight's no good.
- It's okay. We don't have to do this.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.597
What about after school?

07:53.760 --> 07:55.830
Actually, after school's good.
It's better...

07:56.000 --> 07:58.798
...because I'm supposed to have dinner
with my dad. Your place?

07:58.960 --> 08:00.916
- Yeah, see you then.
- Cool.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.359
Well...

08:10.520 --> 08:14.115
...the restaurant's coming along, Sandy.
At this rate, you'll be open by 2008.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.316
And there goes my appetite.
Caleb, hello.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.714
- What the hell is that?
- It's my mother's meat loaf.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.677
- God, your mother's here?
- Her recipe is.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.435
- We're trying out a chef. You want some?
- The sight of your mother's meat loaf...

08:25.600 --> 08:27.989
...has turned me into a vegetarian.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.948
I know you're a big fan of the pop-in, but
is there another reason why you're here?

08:32.120 --> 08:34.236
I've come to ask a favor.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.832
I'm sorry, what did you say?

08:36.000 --> 08:39.197
- You didn't hear me?
- I heard you. I want you to say it again.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.477
- A friend is in trouble. I want you to help.
- I didn't know you had friends.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.074
- It's Bill Shaughnessy.
- Uncle Shaun.

08:45.240 --> 08:49.119
You pay Uncle Shaun to be your friend.
I guess he qualifies. What did he do?

08:49.280 --> 08:52.158
He was drinking, stumbled into
someone else's hotel room.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.596
They called security,
and now it's a legal matter.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.355
- You've got lawyers at your beck and call.
- He came to me as a friend.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.988
I want it handled like a friend.
Quietly.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.628
By someone who has a relationship
with the DA's office?

09:04.800 --> 09:08.679
I'm asking you.
I've known Shaun for over 40 years.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.558
It would mean a lot to me.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.913
- Did Kirsten tell you to say that?
- She thinks you'll say no.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.275
My wife knows me pretty well.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.510
But, you know,
sometimes I like to surprise her.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.195
I don't want her to go and get all
conceited and stuff, you know?

09:23.360 --> 09:26.636
You have a copy of the police report?
Now, I'm not saying that I'll do it.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.157
I'm saying that I'll look at the report,
I'll make some calls and then we'll see.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.828
- Got any more of that meat loaf?
- Maybe.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.797
Well, that was a relief. Dr. Kim seems
to think Marissa's doing well.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.269
I was sure she was gonna revoke
my license to parent.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.908
You know, Jimmy,
I don't think I ever thanked you.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.717
That's not true. You've thanked me
for alienating the community...

09:49.880 --> 09:52.792
...destroying the family.
- For doing a wonderful job with Marissa.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.515
I'm serious.
Listening to you in that meeting...

09:55.680 --> 09:59.832
...you're totally involved in her life.
- You and Caleb must be doing really well.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.955
- Why would you say that?
- Because you're being so...

10:04.120 --> 10:06.156
...nice.
- Well, actually...

10:06.320 --> 10:09.392
...Caleb and I aren't
seeing each other anymore.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.039
And I'm much happier.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.958
And to think, you've spent a lifetime
wanting to be rich and married...

10:17.120 --> 10:20.157
...when what agrees with you most
is being poor and alone.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.548
Isn't it better when we're alone?
Just the two of us?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.673
- Why did you ignore me at school today?
- I didn't ignore you.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.669
Okay, maybe a little.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.718
I just... I want our relationship
to be private, okay?

10:38.880 --> 10:41.075
I don't like other people
knowing my business.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.834
- Why not?
- Because it's none of their business.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.112
Look, there's, like, pressure...

10:47.280 --> 10:50.590
...and scrutiny in the spotlight.
- What spotlight?

10:50.760 --> 10:53.593
When has being in the public eye
ever helped a relationship?

10:53.760 --> 10:57.070
Sure, we're this week's hottest couple,
but then the world gets sick of it.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.152
The shopping sprees, the strip clubs.
People turn against us, okay?

11:00.320 --> 11:02.231
"How many Juicy sweat suits
does she need?"

11:02.400 --> 11:06.234
"That goatee is so mid-'90s." Pretty soon,
the movie bombs and the wedding is off!

11:07.560 --> 11:10.711
But I'm not gonna let that
happen to us, because, Cohen...

11:10.880 --> 11:12.313
...what we have is special.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.392
Summer...

11:15.120 --> 11:18.237
...that's maybe just...

11:24.960 --> 11:26.757
- Guess I'm not very good.
- Yeah.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.514
Want a rematch?
Because I couldn't possibly get any worse.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.752
No, I should probably
start on my homework.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.549
Oh, yeah, me too.
I mean, my dad's probably waiting.

11:37.480 --> 11:41.075
- Is this...? I don't know, are we...?
- Why...? Why is this weird?

11:41.240 --> 11:43.834
- It shouldn't be.
- We used to hang out all the time and...

11:44.000 --> 11:45.797
Make out?

11:46.320 --> 11:48.311
- We could always fight about Luke.
- Or Oliver.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.478
Sorry. I just...

11:56.240 --> 11:57.434
Hey, Ryan.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.992
Hey, Marissa.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.755
I'm early. Sorry.
I'll go and come back later.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.592
It's okay.
We weren't doing anything.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.479
Yeah, I was just leaving.
He's got a lot of homework.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.194
Good to see you, Theresa.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.431
It's nice to see you too.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.552
The ninja game?

12:17.720 --> 12:19.836
You're dead now.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.916
Considering he is your "Uncle" Shaun...

12:26.080 --> 12:28.310
...don't you think it's weird
we have never met?

12:28.960 --> 12:31.758
He's not really my uncle.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.394
- And he pretty much works all the time.
- Doing what?

12:34.560 --> 12:35.959
He's a consultant.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.918
Could you please be a little more vague?

12:39.080 --> 12:40.593
He knows people.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.115
You did it.
That was more vague.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.317
The guys at the permit office,
the union guys.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.550
He's our liaison.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.312
Well, I looked over the police report,
I put in a few calls...

12:54.960 --> 12:58.157
...and I'm sure I'll hear something back
before we get together tonight.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.515
- Thank you.
- Overexposure, Ryan...

13:00.680 --> 13:03.638
...it's a major source of conflict
in new relationships.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.837
"Summereth." "Sethummer."
You understand what I'm saying?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.833
- No. No. That's normal.
- Ryan, your friend Theresa called.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.436
- I'd like to meet Theresa.
- Yeah, she'd like to meet you guys.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.273
- What's she doing here?
- Taking a semester off, making money.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.750
Catering a tennis tournament.
Her mom got laid off.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.480
So she's out here a while.
Does Marissa know? I'm curious.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.916
They kind of bumped into each other.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.992
Look at you, the friend guy.
Bringing friends together.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.037
- I sense sarcasm.
- You're perceptive.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.994
This mysterious <i>caliente</i> female from
your past just shows up out of nowhere...

13:34.160 --> 13:37.914
...with all this time on her hands
and no one to spend it with but you.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.516
- Marissa okay with this?
- She's fine. They're back to being friends.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.352
So when were they ever friends?

13:50.640 --> 13:52.232
You are so beautiful, you know that?

13:54.240 --> 13:55.434
You're very sweet.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.751
- I wish we could stay here forever.
- Why?

14:00.920 --> 14:04.708
We got everything we need here.
We got our bed. We got our cable.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.677
We got each other.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.674
- This place is awesome.
- It's not awesome.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.274
It's $ 79 a night.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.236
I gotta motor.
I don't wanna be late for homeroom.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.158
You have homeroom.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.709
Right. Because you're in high school.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.438
And you're only 18.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.919
Kaitlin, are you okay?

14:30.760 --> 14:32.159
You're in front of the house?

14:32.320 --> 14:35.869
Chester's mom was supposed to pick you
up at Grandma's and take you to school.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.156
Your diorama.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.034
Yeah, I think it's
in the living room, honey.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.510
Okay, just wait there with Grandma.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.199
Okay. See you soon.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.750
- See you tonight?
- Oh, Luke.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.593
Motels, homerooms, dioramas.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.639
- This is not the stuff of great romance.
- But, Mrs...

14:58.960 --> 15:00.678
Julie.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.597
I'm sorry.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.629
- No worries.
- Good.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.033
Hey.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.708
- You mind if...?
- No.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.519
Thanks.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.515
- So, sorry about...
- Sorry I was such a...

15:46.920 --> 15:49.480
- I should've told you she was coming.
- You didn't have to.

15:49.640 --> 15:52.200
But you could've.
I mean, now that we're friends, right?

15:52.360 --> 15:55.830
- Right.
- So you and Theresa...?

15:56.320 --> 15:59.073
- We're friends.
- And she's back in town for...?

15:59.240 --> 16:01.800
Work. She's staying
till the end of the week.

16:02.760 --> 16:06.469
- Where's she staying?
- The motel by the pier.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.710
The Seashell? Sea Monkey?

16:09.160 --> 16:11.549
- The Mermaid.
- Right.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.951
- Next week we could have that rematch.
- Think you're up for it?

16:15.120 --> 16:18.078
Hey, what I lack in nunchaku,
I make up for in saber.

16:19.560 --> 16:20.993
So...

16:21.200 --> 16:23.475
...did you talk to Summer yesterday?
- Yeah.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.916
- Oh, yeah?
- We talked about school...

16:27.080 --> 16:28.911
...and sports and the weather.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.878
But if you're referring to the part
where she's ashamed of me, no.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.598
Didn't get to that.

16:34.600 --> 16:38.513
Were you gonna say something?
Something very wise and helpful, Anna?

16:38.920 --> 16:42.151
- No.
- You got nothing? No advice at all for me?

16:42.320 --> 16:44.754
- I feel like you did.
- Why do I do this?

16:44.920 --> 16:47.195
Because you're so wise, Anna.
You can't not.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.318
All right, fine.
Look, you have to take a stand, all right?

16:50.480 --> 16:52.357
You can't let her get away with it.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.596
Otherwise she has something
to be ashamed of...

16:54.760 --> 16:57.115
...because then her boyfriend
is a coward.

17:00.360 --> 17:04.147
I'm just going to help with the kissing
booth, you know, because I love to help.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.035
Right, coward. Got it.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.478
Hope you don't mind.
I let myself in through the back.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.949
It's what you do.
Famous Uncle Shaun.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.516
Here. Famous Grouse.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.353
I haven't seen a bottle of this
since Bob Mitchum passed.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.318
- You knew Robert Mitchum?
- Yeah. He and his wife Dorothy...

17:26.480 --> 17:30.758
...they used to have a place over there
on Linda Isle.

17:31.280 --> 17:35.239
That was their favorite booth.
Sunday dinners. Chicken parm.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.109
I'm partial to the parm myself,
and a lover of blended Scotch.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.876
And Caleb keeps saying
you have no redeeming qualities.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.998
So I read the police report.
I just have a couple of questions.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.277
This fellow who's pressing charges,
he's in the construction business.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.079
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, he's a lumber supplier...

17:54.240 --> 17:58.518
...one of the biggest in the country.
In fact, he was in town on a negotiation...

17:58.680 --> 18:00.875
...with one of the Newport Group's
chief rivals.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.957
- Imagine that.
- Yeah, I'm guessing...

18:03.640 --> 18:06.313
...that in that room
that you accidentally stumbled into...

18:06.480 --> 18:08.311
...were documents
containing information...

18:08.480 --> 18:11.517
...that would be very valuable
to somebody like Caleb.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.956
- You think?
- You expect me or the DA's office...

18:15.120 --> 18:19.716
...to believe a bellyful of liquor or a wild
coincidence would put you in that room?

18:20.720 --> 18:22.312
You were there for Caleb.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.710
That's an interesting theory.

18:24.880 --> 18:29.431
And one I, you know, hope you don't
explore too much, because...

18:29.600 --> 18:33.718
What is it, "Sandy"? You know, Caleb
and I have been friends for many years.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.713
And if I were to sit down with the DA...

18:36.880 --> 18:40.236
...there's no telling
what we might talk about.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.512
- So, what do you think?
- It's good.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.591
- They call them Balboa Bars.
- It's just ice cream.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.796
No such thing
as just ice cream in Newport.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.748
Like, instead of car washes,
they have auto spas.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.673
Dogs have daycare.
Fashion Island has valet parking.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.558
It's a weird place.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.995
Still, it's beautiful.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.755
I can see why you wanna live here,
start over.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.275
Is that why you came back here?
Start over?

19:15.760 --> 19:18.320
No, I couldn't.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.750
I've got my mom to think about.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.673
My brother. And Eddie.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.879
You guys are still...?

19:27.040 --> 19:31.079
We're taking some time apart. You know,
to see if we really belong together.

19:31.680 --> 19:35.150
- What about you and Marissa?
- Kind of the same thing, I guess.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.551
We're trying to be friends,
but it hasn't exactly been easy.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.678
- Actually, it's never really been...
- Like this.

19:43.480 --> 19:47.359
- That's because I never really liked you.
- True. Makes things easier.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.069
Do you need to stretch
so you won't pull a hammy?

20:08.240 --> 20:11.312
- Or are you ready for your workout?
- I'm sorry, Summer.

20:11.480 --> 20:15.109
I need to take a stand. This separation
of the public and private spheres...

20:15.280 --> 20:17.999
...isn't working for me. I can't do it.
- But I told you how...

20:18.160 --> 20:20.355
One day you might have
some MTV-driven radio hits...

20:20.520 --> 20:22.476
...and then a moderately priced
clothing line.

20:22.640 --> 20:27.031
I could get offered $20 million to portray
a blind superhero in a red leather unitard.

20:27.200 --> 20:31.079
But until then, as long as we're
complete faceless nobodies...

20:31.240 --> 20:32.912
...living in obscurity...

20:33.800 --> 20:37.031
...I can't acknowledge you privately
if you won't acknowledge me publicly.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.919
Let me know when you're ready
to come to the bargaining table.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.911
Until then, just consider me on strike.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.071
You'll cross your own picket line
in no time.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.992
Fight the power.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.000
- Eddie.
- Hey.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.596
- Hey, man.
- How's it going, Ryan? Good to see you.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.238
You look good.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.072
You look good, man.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.959
Yeah, I went up and visited
your brother last week.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.918
It kills me he's still serving time.

21:08.160 --> 21:11.596
- Sucks, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:11.760 --> 21:14.593
It's been a while, man.
What are you doing here?

21:14.760 --> 21:17.479
Well, actually...

21:18.080 --> 21:19.433
...I'm looking for Theresa.

21:19.760 --> 21:20.988
Theresa?

21:21.160 --> 21:25.551
Yeah, you know, her mom said
she was working out here in Newport...

21:25.720 --> 21:29.679
...and your brother said you were living
the life out here, you know, so I...

21:29.840 --> 21:33.310
- I thought maybe you'd seen her.
- She didn't leave a note or something?

21:34.560 --> 21:35.879
No.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.553
Nothing.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.679
Some thanks for the ring I got her, huh?

21:40.840 --> 21:43.877
- Ring?
- Yeah, we're engaged.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.108
Engaged?

21:49.280 --> 21:51.555
Damn, Eddie, that's great, man.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.512
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.512
So she...

21:57.680 --> 22:00.114
I mean, she hasn't looked you up at all?

22:00.280 --> 22:02.475
No, sorry.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.193
- You're living the dream out here, huh?
- Yeah, you said it.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.952
That's all right. You deserve it.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.868
You know, putting up with Trey
for all those years.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.070
All right.
I'm gonna get out of here.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.434
But...

22:28.520 --> 22:32.229
- Hey, if you see her, you know, just...
- Yeah.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.430
I don't know, I just...

22:39.600 --> 22:42.398
I can't believe she'd
run out on me like that.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.434
Neither can I.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.960
- Were you gonna tell me you're engaged?
- I'm not engaged.

22:54.120 --> 22:57.476
- What the hell are you doing?
- He asked, I didn't say yes.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.200
- So you took off. That'll fix everything?
- You did.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.432
Sorry.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.070
You're gonna have to face him
sooner or later.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.277
- I just need time to think.
- Yeah, you need about five years.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.795
- You're 17.
- What's gonna be different in five years?

23:11.960 --> 23:14.110
Or have you forgotten
where you come from?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.953
Not everybody has an infinity pool,
goes to private school...

23:17.120 --> 23:19.395
...and drives a Range Rover.
- What are you saying?

23:19.560 --> 23:23.314
Eddie has his own place, he's a foreman at
work and isn't a screwup like his friends.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.119
- All good reasons to marry him.
- And he loves me.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.234
- And you?
- I just need time.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.148
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Nothing.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.033
- Don't say you're not hungry.
- I didn't say I wasn't hungry.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.549
I'm starving.
Why do you think I'm being a bitch?

23:49.960 --> 23:52.838
What are you gonna do, eat out of
the vending machine? Come on.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.752
Come on.
Come to my house with me.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.676
You just need a ride.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.596
Upstairs, alone. Now.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.514
Upstairs alone? I'm afraid I'd have to
file a grievance with the union.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.671
- I've had enough.
- I left you two hours ago.

24:06.840 --> 24:09.798
Well, it feels like four.
I've been thinking about what you said...

24:09.960 --> 24:13.350
...and I find it totally insensitive.
- I'm being insensitive? Really? How?

24:13.520 --> 24:16.717
Can't you accept that I'm uncomfortable
with public displays of affection?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.560
You're offering yourself for $ 10 a pop
at a kissing booth.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.678
How much more publicly
can affection be displayed?

24:22.840 --> 24:26.674
I know there's a strike,
but technically...

24:26.840 --> 24:30.276
...you wouldn't be considered a scab...
- Summer, don't say "scab."

24:30.800 --> 24:32.677
If you didn't have to do anything.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.749
Well, your strike-busting techniques
are no good here.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.912
Sorry, the rank and file
are holding strong.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.359
Solidarity.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.114
Cal.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.756
- What a surprise.
- A welcome one, I hope.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.878
Well, that depends.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.349
You've brought flowers?

24:59.200 --> 25:01.031
Thank you. They're beautiful.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.395
- I missed you.
- I've missed you too.

25:03.560 --> 25:07.269
Neither of us are love-struck adolescents
looking to be swept off our feet.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.399
We're both adults. Our lives
are full of responsibilities, difficulties.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.391
Well, isn't this romantic.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.710
We should be able
to come to some arrangement...

25:15.880 --> 25:18.838
...where we both get from a relationship
what we want.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.915
Is this a booty call?

25:22.240 --> 25:23.878
What's a booty call?

25:24.040 --> 25:27.032
It's when you show up at night,
unannounced, no apologies...

25:27.200 --> 25:29.714
...no compliments, no commitments...

25:29.880 --> 25:33.156
...just some crappy mini-carns
from Ralphs...

25:33.320 --> 25:35.515
...and a very mistaken idea
that I just might wanna...

25:45.040 --> 25:46.519
Guess it was a booty call.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.148
How much are you involved
with Uncle Shaun, day-to-day?

25:50.320 --> 25:51.719
Not much.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.996
He spends most of his time
out of the office...

25:54.160 --> 25:56.276
...on site with the crews,
suppliers, inspectors.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.716
You gotta be a hard-ass to be good
at that job. Lots of tough characters.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.079
I'm sure Shaun can be persuasive
when he needs to be.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.993
Convincing-argument persuasive,
or baseball-bat persuasive?

26:06.160 --> 26:10.472
If you don't wanna help him, I understand.
I didn't think you'd do it in the first place.

26:10.640 --> 26:14.952
Hey, dinner's ready.
Slaved over hot take-out containers.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.076
- Ryan here?
- Hey.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.197
- This is Theresa.
- Hi.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.351
- Hello, friend.
- Nice to meet you.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.272
I'm Kirsten. And this is...

26:24.440 --> 26:27.238
Sandy. Hi.
I've heard so much about you.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.834
It's nice to meet you all.
Can I help? It looks great.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.596
Sure. The key is taking the food
out of the Styrofoam containers.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.591
But her real specialty is ordering.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.990
Is the silverware in the drawer or...?

26:39.160 --> 26:42.596
What's going on? Don't say "nothing,"
because it's not nothing. It's something.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.399
- She's engaged.
- Wow. You make quick work of the ladies.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.160
- To this guy Eddie.
- Oh, she just told you?

26:48.320 --> 26:51.392
No, he did, when he showed up
looking for her.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.114
What's going on here?

26:56.280 --> 26:59.636
- And don't say "nothing."
- Because it's not nothing. It's something.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.995
What we have here
is our very own <i>telenovela</i>.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.720
- <i>Telenovela</i> ?
- Yeah. Spanish-language soap opera.

27:04.880 --> 27:08.395
<i>Ni Ía Amada M Âa</i>.
I hope Isabela gets Victor.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.959
I love his handlebar moustache.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.032
- You do it.
- Give it to me.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.553
<i>Previously on</i> The Valley <i>:</i>

27:20.760 --> 27:22.432
Hey.

27:22.800 --> 27:26.110
What are you doing home?
I thought you'd be over at Ryan's house.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.238
He's kind of busy.
A friend from home.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.551
- Theresa.
- And you're okay with that?

27:32.720 --> 27:35.280
- Yeah. It's not a big deal.
- It is kind of a big deal.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.635
- He's important to you.
- What's important to me...

27:37.800 --> 27:41.554
...is that we not talk about this right now,
because I'm fine.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.759
It's just high school.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.512
Hey, that's supposed to be my line, okay?
You're supposed to say...

27:48.680 --> 27:52.468
...I could never understand. And how Ryan
is the most important thing in the world...

27:52.640 --> 27:55.279
...and without him...
- We're just friends.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.399
- Or at least we're trying to be.
- Look, at the risk of embarrassing you...

27:59.560 --> 28:01.357
...you and Ryan...

28:02.040 --> 28:04.110
...never friends.
- So I've been told.

28:04.280 --> 28:07.670
- But if we can't be friends, then...
- Let him know what you wanna be.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.873
See? There's still room around here
for me to be the adult.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.758
Okay?

28:16.280 --> 28:18.589
So we're all dressed up
for my brother's 16th birthday.

28:18.760 --> 28:22.719
Not this one. Don't you have anything
that doesn't involve me falling down?

28:22.880 --> 28:25.314
Did Ryan fall down when he did musicals?
Tell us.

28:25.480 --> 28:29.189
You did musicals?
I did a musical or two myself in college.

28:29.360 --> 28:32.352
Someone stop him before he starts
singing "Greased Lightnin'."

28:32.520 --> 28:34.112
Do it, Dad. Travolta's your bitch.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.918
- Thank you, son.
- Go ahead.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.469
We were at the Holiday Inn,
at the revolving restaurant...

28:38.640 --> 28:41.632
...and Ryan has this thing about heights...
- I'll get it.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.392
Excuse me.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.550
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.154
- Is Ryan here?
- Yes, he is.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.629
- I love revolving restaurants.
- Who doesn't?

28:53.800 --> 28:56.030
Motion and digestion,
unbeatable combination.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.792
Look who's here.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.831
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.070
Does everybody know everybody?

29:07.240 --> 29:09.629
- Yeah. Hi, Theresa.
- Hi, Marissa.

29:11.720 --> 29:15.235
- You hungry?
- Actually, I'm starved. Is it okay?

29:15.400 --> 29:17.231
- Sure.
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.914
Let me get you a plate.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.673
So, what's everyone talking about?

29:38.240 --> 29:41.118
Hey, man, phone for you.
It's Eddie.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.511
Hey, man, I can't find him.
Do you want me to take a message?

29:48.760 --> 29:50.637
Apparently not. He hung up.

29:50.800 --> 29:55.112
So dinner last night,
entertaining for the rest of us...

29:55.320 --> 29:57.550
...but for you, wow.
- What, last night?

29:57.720 --> 30:00.553
The whole dinner-theater/<i>telenovela</i> thing
you performed.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.359
- <i>Telenovela?</i>
- Yeah, Spanish-language sudser.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.829
Telemundo, dude. Univision.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.911
Victor, with the sexy
handlebar moustache.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.311
So you still have the mindset
that you're the friend guy, huh?

30:13.480 --> 30:16.040
Befriending any beautiful woman
who cares to dine with us?

30:16.200 --> 30:19.397
- I'm working on it.
- Right. Well, if I may...

30:19.560 --> 30:22.120
...speaking from
a recent personal experience...

30:22.680 --> 30:26.514
...the triangle's not a friendly shape,
okay? It's pointy. It's got sharp edges.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.636
- Triangles hurt people.
- There's no triangle.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.950
Marissa and I aren't together.
Theresa's here for work.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.509
Except Marissa still obviously
has feelings for you...

30:33.680 --> 30:36.114
...and Theresa obviously
has feelings for you.

30:36.280 --> 30:40.068
In fact, the only thing that's not obvious
is how Ryan Atwood feels.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.795
- I don't know. It's complicated.
- It is complicated.

30:43.960 --> 30:47.191
It's complicated by the fact that
there's an Eddie who still obviously...

30:47.360 --> 30:50.955
...has feelings for Theresa. That would
actually make this romantic triangle...

30:51.120 --> 30:54.396
...more of a romantic rhombus.
- So, what am I supposed to do?

30:54.560 --> 30:57.233
That I don't know.
But I would do something soon...

30:57.400 --> 30:59.436
...otherwise someone's gonna get hurt.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.233
Judging from Eddie's phone voice,
it's probably gonna be you.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.798
<i>What the hell do you expect, Sandy?</i>

31:06.360 --> 31:09.989
Construction's a dirty business.
Bids accepted below cost.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.674
Permits mysteriously approved
at the last second.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.912
Guys like Shaun
are the lifeblood of the industry.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.398
Well, that was a touching speech, Cal,
but still the answer's no.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.273
Good luck.

31:21.440 --> 31:25.672
You're opening a Pandora's box,
you know that? Shaun's old. He's tired.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.838
If the DA starts asking questions,
he's got lots of answers.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.231
If you build your empire on quicksand,
sooner or later it's gonna sink.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.119
What about Kirsten?
She's complicit in all this too.

31:35.280 --> 31:38.397
- She doesn't know anything about this.
- Because I didn't tell her.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.597
I was trying to protect her.
But she's number two at Newport Group.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.910
She signs Shaun's paychecks.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.799
So like it or not,
we're in this mess together.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.913
Hey.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.718
Hi.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.870
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

32:05.040 --> 32:08.999
It's not like Cohen and I planned to
get together. It sort of just happened.

32:09.160 --> 32:12.152
And if it makes you feel better,
I don't think it's gonna work out.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.269
Well, that makes me feel great.

32:19.280 --> 32:22.352
I just can't be like one of those
couples, you know...

32:22.520 --> 32:25.353
...who hold hands in the hallway
and make out in between classes.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.795
Let the whole world
know what's going on.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.315
It's none of their business, you know?

32:30.560 --> 32:32.232
You don't have to ignore him, Summer.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.958
I don't ignore him.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.395
Okay, maybe a little,
but only in public.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.835
You spent so much time
trying to get his attention.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.877
I mean, you dressed up
as Wonder Woman.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.080
Well, Wonder Woman
is supposed to have an invisible jet...

32:44.680 --> 32:47.240
...not an invisible boyfriend.

32:48.440 --> 32:51.830
I mean, either you're really evil
or there's something else going on.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.989
I just don't know why he likes me.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.636
I mean, he's way smarter. And we have,
like, less than nothing in common.

33:00.800 --> 33:04.031
And he's just gonna get bored with me,
because, pretty much, all boys do.

33:04.560 --> 33:05.993
If everybody knows we're dating...

33:06.160 --> 33:08.674
...they'll know when he breaks up
with me, which he will.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.797
I mean, dumped by Seth Cohen?

33:14.960 --> 33:17.315
It's real good for my reputation.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.755
- Hello?
- <i>Luke.</i>

33:23.040 --> 33:26.828
- Hey, Mrs...
- Do not say my name out loud.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.275
Come to the motel.
Park across the street and walk.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.954
I'll get the same room.
Knock twice so I know it's you.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.189
<i>And, Luke...</i>

33:33.880 --> 33:35.108
...this is a booty call.

33:40.640 --> 33:44.030
It turns out you're not the only one
who's a coward.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.277
- Oh, it's nice to see you also, yeah?
- Summer's scared too.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.635
I know. She's scared to be seen
in public with me.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.473
Come on, Cohen. She fought for you.
She was fearless.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.877
Ruthless, in fact.
Now she's got you.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.798
There's nothing scarier than that.

33:58.240 --> 34:01.437
Nothing scarier than being with me,
or do you mean, like, anyone?

34:01.600 --> 34:03.909
Look, once you get what you want...

34:04.080 --> 34:05.991
...that's when you've got
something to lose.

34:06.240 --> 34:08.117
She's afraid of losing you, Cohen.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.952
Why? I'm not going anywhere.

34:10.239 --> 34:11.878
Maybe you need to let her know that.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.476
- Hi.
- Hey.

34:38.639 --> 34:41.199
Can we talk?
I know it's weird, me being here...

34:41.360 --> 34:45.194
...but I just really needed to know...
- Am I still in love with Ryan?

34:47.040 --> 34:48.632
Because you still are.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.712
I don't wanna be.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.838
It would be a whole lot easier
if I wasn't.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.550
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Hey.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.790
It's a long drive just to come say hello.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.875
Last night, when you asked me
about Theresa...

35:30.040 --> 35:32.156
...I wasn't completely honest.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.238
Carl.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.559
- I'm gonna take a break, all right?
- Okay.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.677
- So why lie?
- I'm sorry, man. I didn't...

35:53.400 --> 35:56.551
- She staying with you?
- No. She's working, like her mom said.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.591
Still, I...

36:00.760 --> 36:03.115
I mean, I pop the question...

36:03.280 --> 36:05.157
...and she runs away...

36:06.280 --> 36:08.077
...to you.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.637
Married?

36:11.280 --> 36:14.636
- Wow.
- Yeah, that's the plan.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.589
You must really love him a lot.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.074
<i>Do you love her?</i>

36:21.960 --> 36:24.394
- I don't know.
- Yeah, well, I do.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.232
Okay? I do.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.994
And I wanna take care of her.
Do you?

36:29.160 --> 36:30.798
I mean, can you?

36:31.760 --> 36:34.433
Look, I know this is tough. L...

36:35.840 --> 36:38.274
I can't tell you what to do.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.549
But if you wanted to,
you could talk to her.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.676
You know, convince her to come home.

36:43.840 --> 36:47.719
Otherwise, be ready to fight for her,
because I'm not just gonna walk away.

36:47.880 --> 36:49.518
I can't.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.075
You got a long ride home.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.639
You got a lot to think about.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.032
In the church where my mom goes,
there's a stained glass window...

37:05.200 --> 37:06.952
...of Teresa of Avila.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.995
Her heart's being pierced
by the arrow of an angel.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.399
Her eyes are closed.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.474
And even though it hurts her
to love that much...

37:15.640 --> 37:17.358
...she has the most beautiful smile.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.037
I remember my first communion.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.350
I was wearing a white dress and gloves.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.080
<i>And I looked up at that window</i>
<i>and I thought...</i>

37:27.240 --> 37:29.959
<i>... someday someone</i>
<i>would pierce my heart...</i>

37:31.040 --> 37:34.077
...and I would walk down the aisle
in a real white dress...

37:34.240 --> 37:36.071
...and understand why she's smiling.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.073
I know it sounds lame.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.473
But I guess life's not really like that.

37:51.640 --> 37:54.916
You can't get caught up in wishing
for something that's not gonna happen.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.159
You gotta hold on to the next best thing.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.630
I guess I should call Eddie.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.953
Yeah.
I should get back to school.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.428
So thanks.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.320
I can see why Ryan likes it here.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.478
Here you go. Full refund.
Thanks for coming. The show's over.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.710
Thanks so much, though.
It was great having you.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.348
- This kid bothering you, Summer?
- No, it's okay. Thanks.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.033
- Thanks.
- You're making a scene.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.077
- I need to talk to you.
- I'll IM you later.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.792
Okay.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.712
- Let's talk up here.
- Oh, my God. No.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.156
- Summer, I know you're scared.
- Yeah, of you.

38:58.320 --> 39:01.517
You kiss these other guys, but you won't
kiss me? Acknowledge me now...

39:01.680 --> 39:03.875
...or lose me forever.
- You're dating this emo geek?

39:04.040 --> 39:06.315
Yes, Brad, she's dating this emo geek.

39:06.480 --> 39:10.473
Yeah, that's right. I'm a big dork
and I listen to emo. And I'm dating her.

39:10.640 --> 39:14.474
- Why are you doing this?
- Because, Summer, I like you this much.

39:14.680 --> 39:17.433
And if you don't feel
the same way about me, then...

39:17.880 --> 39:20.599
Someone will have to give me
a hand down. It's high up here...

39:20.760 --> 39:23.911
...and I could fall and that would be
embarrassing. More embarrassing.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.598
I can't believe this.

39:44.760 --> 39:48.116
It's all over but the big,
public make-out session.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.153
That'll be 10 bucks, Cohen.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.550
That's for a worthy cause.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.035
Hey, Carl, can I talk to Eddie?

40:09.200 --> 40:12.078
Yeah. Yeah, I'll hold on.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.397
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:22.560 --> 40:23.754
You packing?

40:25.120 --> 40:26.599
Yeah.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.589
I think I should probably go home.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.354
Seems like the right thing to do, right?

40:32.960 --> 40:36.635
You gotta do what's right for you.
You and Eddie.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.360
I gotta figure out what's right for me...

40:39.520 --> 40:40.839
...and Marissa.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.118
Right.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.673
So if it's the right thing to do,
why don't I want you to go?

40:50.800 --> 40:52.870
Why don't I wanna go?

41:00.160 --> 41:02.276
I can think of a reason.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.272
<i>Hello?</i>

41:15.600 --> 41:17.192
<i>Hello?</i>

41:17.520 --> 41:19.272
<i>Theresa, are you there?</i>

41:19.640 --> 41:21.392
<i>Theresa?</i>

41:22.305 --> 41:28.754
