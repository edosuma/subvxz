vigorously get this man off.

00:23.424 --> 00:26.258
<i>And he goes by the name

00:26.260 --> 00:27.393
I don't settle! Ever!

00:34.101 --> 00:35.734

00:35.736 --> 00:39.171
<i>Dean Sanderson is...
The Grinder.</i>

00:39.173 --> 00:43.275
<i>There's no one he can't get off.</i>

00:43.277 --> 00:44.443
WOMAN:
Okay, so that's<i> The Grinder,</i>

00:44.445 --> 00:46.445
Fox's sexy legal drama.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.946
Looking for knee-jerk reactions.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.448
(over intercom):
First thoughts, first thoughts.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.849
DEAN: And these people
are all from...?

00:50.851 --> 00:52.251
Yeah, downtown,
right off the street.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.486
And they know nothing about...?
Anything, right.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.488
Yeah, we like them coming in
completely blind.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.923
To everything.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.925
Uh-huh. Sure.
MAN: Tagline's super tight.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.277
WOMAN: Interesting.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.628
Warren likes the tagline.
Who agrees with Warren?

01:02.630 --> 01:04.129
I don't.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.464
I think it's dumb.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.299
WOMAN:
Okay, Joyce thinks it's dumb.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.801
Why is that?

01:08.803 --> 01:10.269
What's dumb about it?

01:10.271 --> 01:12.304
I just think there's gotta be
someone he can't get off.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.640
I mean, he can just
get anybody off?

01:14.642 --> 01:15.941
(scoffs) Please.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.043
I'd like to see him get
my brother-in-law off.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.646
(laughs): Okay. Who else thinks
that Joyce has a point

01:20.648 --> 01:22.047
and maybe there's somebody
out there

01:22.049 --> 01:23.882
the he probably can't get off?

01:26.654 --> 01:29.121
Okay, Joyce,
given no one agrees with you,

01:29.123 --> 01:31.023
do you care to rethink
your position at all?

01:31.025 --> 01:33.525
(hesitantly):
I... guess I was wrong.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.061
And these people
are never wrong?

01:36.063 --> 01:37.896
Not according to our research.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.898
Well, go on,
try it out for yourself.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.302
Ask them what they thought
of the actor

01:43.304 --> 01:44.903
who played The Grinder.
What did we think

01:44.905 --> 01:47.039
about Dean Sanderson
who played The Grinder?

01:47.041 --> 01:48.373
Courtney?

01:48.375 --> 01:49.308
I thought he was hot.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.742
Courtney thought he was hot.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.044
Who else thought
The Grinder was hot?

01:52.046 --> 01:53.378
Mmm.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.646
You see?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.315
Oh, this is real.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.217
This works.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.652
¶ ¶

02:02.756 --> 02:04.223
DEAN: Mr. Sanderson.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.724
You're being accused
of malpractice,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.226
is that not correct?

02:07.228 --> 02:09.561
Yeah, we know that. Okay.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.829
Move to have that stricken
from the record.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.664
Got it. Dean, there
is no record, so if

02:12.666 --> 02:13.832
we could just,
you know, keep going.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.434
Yeah, we're just prepping
him for the stand.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.736
Which I don't need.
You do need it, Dad.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.072
Okay, everybody, this is not
how we're going to do this.

02:20.074 --> 02:21.507
Not today.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.008
The negativity, the hole-poking.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.911
I mean, you wanted me back,
right, Stew?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.613
Right? You destroyed
a whole office?

02:27.615 --> 02:29.515
I did, yes.
And I got the guy to admit

02:29.517 --> 02:31.116
that there was somebody else
behind this.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.418
Even though Stewart
was saying that the whole time.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.120
So, this is how we're
going to do this.

02:35.122 --> 02:38.190
All right.
I'm going to start from the top.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.558
Mr. Sanderson,
you're being accused

02:39.560 --> 02:40.792
of malpractice, is that...

02:40.794 --> 02:42.127
No, no. I'm done.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.862
Hey, you're not done
until Dean says you're done.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.531
Don't I get a say in this?

02:45.533 --> 02:47.933
Dad, calm down. I am calm!

02:47.935 --> 02:49.434
This is a waste of time!

02:49.436 --> 02:50.936
I've been doing this
for 50 years!

02:50.938 --> 02:53.438
I think I know my way
around a courtroom!

02:53.440 --> 02:54.439
Yes, Your Honor.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.475
No, Your Honor.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.976
Objection, Your Honor.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.611
Dismissed, Your Honor.
(banging, crashing)

02:59.613 --> 03:00.879
STEWART: <i>It's a problem.</i>

03:00.881 --> 03:03.282
He is off the rails, guys.
Oh, come on,

03:03.284 --> 03:04.550
he's letting off a little steam.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.051
And you know what?
He's earned that right.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.120
He yelled at me for eating
his yogurt this morning.

03:08.122 --> 03:09.655
Well, was it labeled?
Well, yeah, but...

03:09.657 --> 03:11.557
Then what are we talking about?

03:11.559 --> 03:12.958
We're talking about
a jury, Dean,

03:12.960 --> 03:14.660
and how they're gonna
respond to Dad.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.894
They're gonna love him.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.396
The guy is a big goose. He is?

03:17.398 --> 03:19.398
Maybe you guys just need
an outside perspective.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.566
I don't know, honey,
I think we have

03:20.568 --> 03:21.800
a pretty solid
inside perspective.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.469
Uh, you know what?
It never hurts...

03:24.471 --> 03:27.005
to listen to the people.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.574
Oh, what did you do, Deb? Sorry.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.409
The people know.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.177
Whenever we had
a creative disagreement

03:32.179 --> 03:34.513
on<i> The Grinder,</i>
we would go to them

03:34.515 --> 03:37.149
and let them... guide us.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.584
What...? Wait, who?

03:38.586 --> 03:40.085
A random focus group, E.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.687
A collection of completely
average strangers

03:41.689 --> 03:43.589
who help us decide
what works and what doesn't.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.090
For what? Anything.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.091
Which is why
they're so valuable.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.926
It's also why Mitch Grinder

03:47.928 --> 03:50.696
is the highest-testing
TV character in history.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.431
Okay, I'm just not sure
that we need a focus group

03:52.433 --> 03:54.666
to find out if Dad has a temper.

03:54.668 --> 03:55.934
Well, no, I'm not either.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.436
But what if we could use
the focus group

03:57.438 --> 04:00.505
to get us from "not sure"
to definitely sure?

04:00.507 --> 04:02.441
On whether or not we need them?
On all of it.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.843
You know what?
I'm going to set this up.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.513
It could be helpful. Oh, yeah.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.515
I'm sure the people Dean finds
at the mall will be invaluable.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.284
You're probably
just too close to it.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.685
Or maybe I'm the appropriate
distance to it, honey,

04:13.687 --> 04:14.786
and I'm just right.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.622
In that case,
I'm sure the focus group

04:16.624 --> 04:18.123
will sniff that out
and have your back.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.291
I don't know, will they?

04:19.293 --> 04:20.559
I mean, who are these people?

04:20.561 --> 04:21.960
And why do I need them
coming to my office

04:21.962 --> 04:23.629
telling me how to do my job?

04:23.631 --> 04:26.832
Whoa! Are we sure your dad's
the one with the anger problem?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.367
I'm getting a lot of heat coming
from you right now. Okay.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.901
You know, hon...
Thank... Good night.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.204
Maybe that focus group could help
<i>you</i> out a little bit. All right.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.766
Thank you, honey.
That's a great note.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.642
They're out there.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.044
I can feel it.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.979
We just gotta find
the right people.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.547
At the mall?!

04:42.549 --> 04:44.316
At the mall, Todd.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.550
Middle of the week.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.052
Middle of the day.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.654
Uh-huh. Why?!

04:48.656 --> 04:50.222
We're looking for drifters.

04:50.224 --> 04:52.224
People with nowhere to be,

04:52.226 --> 04:54.426
just breezin'
through their lives,

04:54.428 --> 04:56.094
nothin' on their minds.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.830
Yeah. No distractions
like work or thoughts.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.166
Blank slates.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.568
And, of course, a willingness
to do whatever we want

05:03.570 --> 05:05.003
for 20 bucks on a Wednesday.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.505
Then what?
Well, then we blindly trust

05:06.507 --> 05:09.241
those people
and allow them to steer us

05:09.243 --> 05:11.510
in the handling
of my father's case.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.778
Ah, yeah, that makes sense.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.246
Yeah, yeah.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.515
They're out there,
we just gotta find 'em.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.949
How?

05:17.951 --> 05:19.518
Todd, I think it's
the constant questions,

05:19.520 --> 05:21.253
more than anything else,
that so frustrating for me.

05:21.255 --> 05:23.588
Oh, right, and I'm
sorry about that.

05:23.590 --> 05:24.856
You had to have felt that, right?
I did.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.358
As soon as I...
Opened your mouth?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.759
Yes. And you did it anyway.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.195
I had to ask because I was...
Curious.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.364
Mm-hmm. Well, I love
that about you,

05:32.366 --> 05:35.467
but it's just very demoralizing.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.868
Sure.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.637
I get that.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.539
DEAN: <i>We got a good group.</i>

05:40.541 --> 05:42.140
Diverse group, which I like.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.442
That's great, Dean.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.609
And totally necessary.

05:44.611 --> 05:45.811
Yeah, and they're just...

05:45.813 --> 05:47.145
folks, you know?

05:47.147 --> 05:48.780
Salt of the earth. Mm.

05:48.782 --> 05:49.948
I like the process.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.316
Seems like the simplest,

05:51.318 --> 05:53.051
most logical way to do it.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.453
You know, I could really use
a focus group of my own

05:54.455 --> 05:56.488
to give me some daily feedback.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.457
'Cause I'm obviously
doing something wrong.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.458
So, wait, you want
a group of people

05:59.460 --> 06:01.460
to tell you how lame you are?

06:01.462 --> 06:02.894
Uncle Dean, can we arrange that?

06:02.896 --> 06:04.830
No, we cannot arrange that.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.398
And we don't need to, honey.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.899
Lizzie, you can't worry about
what other people think.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.968
Wow. Okay, I understand

06:09.970 --> 06:11.670
that there are different
parenting styles,

06:11.672 --> 06:13.572
but that sounds insane.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.173
You don't care what
other people think?

06:15.175 --> 06:17.309
How are you supposed
to know how to behave?

06:17.311 --> 06:19.745
You just... be yourself.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.246
ETHAN: Even in Lizzie's case?

06:21.248 --> 06:23.482
Feels like that's gonna
come up short, no? Ethan.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.917
Guys, it's okay. He's right.
I need help.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.919
We all do.
There's no shame in it.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.688
Behind every big
decision in my life,

06:29.690 --> 06:31.256
has been
a focus group weighing in.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.324
Even the move to Boise?

06:32.326 --> 06:33.525
Oh, tested huge.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.761
Interesting. You know
what, I'll have Todd

06:35.763 --> 06:37.028
print out some comment cards

06:37.030 --> 06:38.597
and you can distribute them
at school.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.332
Awesome. Thanks, Uncle Dean.
Great.

06:40.334 --> 06:42.100
No problem. Oh, oh, hey, uh,

06:42.102 --> 06:43.602
can Stewart and I have the room?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.270
Um...

06:45.272 --> 06:46.605
You want us to leave? This room?
Right now?

06:46.607 --> 06:47.873
Yeah, we need the room.
Do you mind?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.341
ETHAN: Okay. LIZZIE: I guess.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.346
(clears throat)

06:55.716 --> 06:56.681
What are you doing?

06:56.683 --> 06:58.183
Checking on you.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.218
For tomorrow.
Oh, you mean the...

07:00.220 --> 07:01.853
the focus group thing? Yes!

07:01.855 --> 07:04.122
And, Stew,
it's okay to be nervous.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.892
'Cause you may hear some
things about your father,

07:06.894 --> 07:08.894
things that are going to make
you feel very uncomfortable.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.696
Things that no son
should ever have to hear.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.698
Really? Like what?

07:13.700 --> 07:14.866
I don't know.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.301
It's an very
unpredictable process.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.837
But it is also
an infallible one.

07:18.839 --> 07:22.207
So I need to know that you're
going to hear the feedback,

07:22.209 --> 07:25.744
and that you're going to then
make the necessary adjustments.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.145
What do you say?

07:28.315 --> 07:30.315
I mean,

07:30.317 --> 07:31.716
I think we should...

07:31.718 --> 07:34.419
Ah, yeah, trust the process.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.655
So just sit back
and-and take it all in.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.490
Um, underneath your seats
you'll find

07:38.492 --> 07:41.259
your comment cards,
so write down any thoughts

07:41.261 --> 07:42.727
that you might have.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.229
Oh... Yes.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.230
What are we watching?

07:45.232 --> 07:46.498
It's best if you don't know.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.233
That way you're going in
completely blind

07:48.235 --> 07:50.235
and you have
no preconceived notions.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.070
Um, and remember,
there is no thought

07:52.072 --> 07:54.272
that is not worth having.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.507
And sharing.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.775
Okay. Stew,

07:56.777 --> 07:57.609
you're up.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.178
Uh... Okay.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.447
Could you please, uh, state
your name for the record?

08:02.449 --> 08:04.115
I'd be happy to.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.551
Dean Thomas Sanderson Sr.

08:06.553 --> 08:07.752
I reside...

08:07.754 --> 08:09.855
That's good. Thank you.
Uh, how many years

08:09.857 --> 08:12.757
have you been practicing law?
Well, gee, uh,

08:12.759 --> 08:15.794
it's been nearly 50 years, hasn't it?
It has. Yes.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.696
Uh, great. How many of you
are having a hard time

08:17.698 --> 08:20.699
hearing Stewart?
Could you speak up a little bit?

08:20.701 --> 08:22.901
I-I think the panel's
having a hard time hearing you.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.402
I just feel like I'm shouting.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.471
Okay. All right, sir,

08:26.473 --> 08:27.873
what, um... (clears throat)

08:27.875 --> 08:30.275
what is your relationship
with alcohol?

08:30.277 --> 08:31.977
What are you trying to get at?
Well, isn't it true

08:31.979 --> 08:34.045
that during this time,
you would have

08:34.047 --> 08:35.981
a couple of drinks
during the workday?

08:35.983 --> 08:38.717
Objection! No, Todd, you can't...
That's not...

08:38.719 --> 08:40.151
There's no objections.
We're just... Dad,

08:40.153 --> 08:42.120
these are the questions
they're gonna ask you.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.555
So if you could
just answer, please.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.790
Well, everybody drank.
That was the time.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.492
It was 1998.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.727
STEWART:
Well, isn't it possible, uh,

08:48.729 --> 08:49.728
that you had...
How many of you are having

08:49.730 --> 08:50.795
a hard time seeing

08:50.797 --> 08:51.897
Dean Sr.?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.665
Stewart,

08:53.667 --> 08:55.233
I think if you just move
a little bit...

08:55.235 --> 08:56.902
Is that better?

08:56.904 --> 08:58.136
Mm-hmm. Great.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.138
So, Dad, isn't it possible

09:00.140 --> 09:03.141
that at some point during
this case you had one too many

09:03.143 --> 09:06.144
and you got a little sloppy and
that's why you lost a decision

09:06.146 --> 09:08.413
that Mr. Manler
is still paying for today?

09:08.415 --> 09:10.415
I got that kid a great deal!

09:10.417 --> 09:12.417
This is bullcrap!

09:12.419 --> 09:14.586
I'm out of here.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.654
Hey! What are

09:15.656 --> 09:17.422
you writin'?
If you got something

09:17.424 --> 09:18.423
to say to me, say it

09:18.425 --> 09:19.624
to my face!

09:19.626 --> 09:22.193
Yeah, I didn't think so.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.101
It seemed like the old dude
got real angry for no reason.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.270
Who else thought
that the old dude

09:32.272 --> 09:34.832
got real angry for no reason?

09:36.109 --> 09:36.975
How 'bout that?

09:36.977 --> 09:38.310
Any other first impressions?

09:38.312 --> 09:39.644
Uh, it seemed
like the guy asking

09:39.646 --> 09:43.148
the questions was
a little... weak?

09:43.150 --> 09:44.349
Oh, uh, no, no,

09:44.351 --> 09:45.617
you-you must've misunderstood.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.118
This is not about me. Stewart,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.153
the people are speaking.

09:48.155 --> 09:51.356
Who else thought
that Stewart was weak?

09:51.358 --> 09:53.058
No, I didn't really think
he was weak.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.293
Well, thank you. I just didn't
really buy that he was a lawyer.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.729
No offense. Quite all right.
Yeah, he never said

09:57.731 --> 09:59.230
"objection" once.
That bugged me.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.966
He had no charisma.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.500
WOMAN: The woman, though,

10:02.502 --> 10:03.368
she was great.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.537
Yeah, I loved her dry delivery.

10:05.539 --> 10:06.871
Yeah. I want to see more of her.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.673
What?

10:08.675 --> 10:10.675
Yes! That!

10:10.677 --> 10:11.876
MAN: So funny.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.645
Hey.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.714
Hey. How'd it go?

10:15.716 --> 10:18.049
Uh, good. The testing group
thought Dad came off angry,

10:18.051 --> 10:19.684
so Dean agrees with me now.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.886
So it was helpful.
Yeah, so helpful.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.388
Any time you can get
six strangers from the mall

10:23.390 --> 10:25.056
to validate what you've been
saying all along...

10:25.058 --> 10:26.558
Oh, yeah,
that-that must feel good.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.059
It's a great day. (Chuckles)

10:28.061 --> 10:30.695
Uh, hey, Deb...

10:30.697 --> 10:32.364
I seem lawyerly to you, right?

10:32.366 --> 10:33.231
What? Well,

10:33.233 --> 10:35.433
you know, like...

10:35.435 --> 10:37.068
I'm a lawyer
and I seem like one.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.036
(door opens) DEAN: Guys,

10:38.038 --> 10:39.704
we have a problem.

10:39.706 --> 10:42.907
The game... just changed.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.342
What game? Yeah, what
are you talking about?

10:44.344 --> 10:45.377
We have an outlier.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.778
A stray comment on a card

10:46.780 --> 10:48.947
that almost got by us.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.882
Okay. Uh, what is it?

10:50.884 --> 10:53.284
"It seemed
like the white-haired guy

10:53.286 --> 10:55.153
was hiding something."

10:56.590 --> 10:57.722
Right?

10:57.724 --> 10:59.457
It's a stunner.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.059
Is it? Well, I don't think
that's the question

11:01.061 --> 11:02.027
we should be asking, Deb.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.094
I think the question

11:03.096 --> 11:04.863
we should be asking is:
What is it?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.448
Maybe nothing?

11:06.449 --> 11:08.032
Yeah, 'cause only
one person said it.

11:08.035 --> 11:08.900
No, you can't just pick
and choose the notes

11:08.902 --> 11:10.368
that you're going to listen to.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.704
You either listen to all of them
or you listen to none of them.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.906
Oh. Well, then none of them.
Because no one else thought Dad

11:14.908 --> 11:17.609
was hiding anything. And they didn't
think he<i> wasn't</i> hiding anything either.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.611
So they're supposed to write down
everything they<i> didn't</i> think?

11:19.613 --> 11:22.113
So, I got some feedback
from some girls at school,

11:22.115 --> 11:24.149
and apparently half of them
don't even know who I am.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.918
Do you see what happens, Dean? DEBBIE:
Honey, if it's any consolation to you,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.887
we know exactly who you are.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.755
Well, my friends kept
it pretty positive.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.323
Mostly asking
for more of some stuff

11:32.325 --> 11:33.892
but nothing I can't deliver on.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.760
Guys, we can either stick
our head in the sand

11:35.762 --> 11:37.262
or we can deal with the facts.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.763
Lizzie, you're forgettable.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.265
We know that now.
So the question becomes

11:40.267 --> 11:41.633
what are we gonna do about it?

11:41.635 --> 11:42.934
Nothing, she's perfect. No.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.402
I will do whatever it takes.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.304
Damn right you will.
And so will we.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.174
Stew, get out your shovel,
'cause we have got some...

11:49.176 --> 11:50.442
Digging to do... Digging to do.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.243
Right. Got it.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.344
STEWART: <i>So it's unanimous,</i>

11:53.346 --> 11:55.113
Dad has a severe anger problem.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.982
So what do we do about it?
DEAN: So we're

11:57.984 --> 11:59.517
just going to ignore it?

11:59.519 --> 12:01.319
Ignore what? Stewart knows what.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.421
One guy thought
Dad was hiding something.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.423
Oh, that sounds like something.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.991
That's because it is
something, Todd.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.993
No, it isn't anything.
We just need to get Dad ready

12:08.995 --> 12:10.795
for the stand. Okay, what
about the next stand

12:10.797 --> 12:12.630
and the stand after that?

12:12.632 --> 12:14.599
Yeah,
what about those two stands?

12:14.601 --> 12:16.267
What? Dean, how 'bout this?

12:16.269 --> 12:18.770
Since everyone thought he came
off angry and only one person

12:18.772 --> 12:20.672
thought he was
maybe hiding something,

12:20.674 --> 12:22.273
we deal with the anger first.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.675
What if I told you...

12:23.677 --> 12:24.943
(scraping)

12:24.945 --> 12:26.544
that the anger

12:26.546 --> 12:28.980
was caused by guilt?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.615
Over what he was hiding.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.650
Yeah. That's where my head went
as well.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.785
I think it's where
everybody's head went.

12:33.787 --> 12:34.686
Nope. Not my head.

12:34.688 --> 12:36.454
We figure that out...

12:36.456 --> 12:38.296
the old man sings on the stand.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.960
(scraping)

12:47.200 --> 12:49.300
All right. Thank you, Todd.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.770
¶ ¶

12:56.409 --> 12:57.842
What's with the glasses?

12:57.844 --> 13:00.311
Oh. I, uh...
You know, my left eye

13:00.313 --> 13:01.913
gets a little fuzzy. Mmm.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.648
Until I go see the doctor,
I'm just gonna wear these,

13:03.650 --> 13:06.584
'cause it seems to really help.
Stewart.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.888
The focus group
said that there were

13:09.890 --> 13:11.856
a few areas I could improve in.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.591
I thought we didn't care
what other people think.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.527
No, we don't care. I don't care.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.695
I'm just taking what's useful.
You know, not all of it,

13:17.697 --> 13:20.431
like Dean. Just, you know, parts.
Uh-huh.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.200
Okay, well, in that case...
Guys! (Panting)

13:22.202 --> 13:24.035
Why are you breathing so hard?
What's wrong?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.271
Uh, no-no time to explain.
Say something nice

13:26.273 --> 13:27.273
about Lizzie's hair.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.342
Wow! Look at... you!

13:31.344 --> 13:32.944
STEWART: That is a really...
What a...

13:32.946 --> 13:34.546
strong... That's a bold choice.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.114
Choice you've made.
Really nice, honey.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.883
Yeah, thanks for noticing.
Nobody at school did.

13:38.885 --> 13:39.717
Doubt that.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.052
No. I'm invisible,

13:41.054 --> 13:42.353
and I guess there's just nothing

13:42.355 --> 13:43.454
(voice breaking):
I can ever do to change that.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.123
Okay, first of all,
that's not true.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.724
Mm-mm. And second of all,

13:46.726 --> 13:48.426
you shouldn't be listening
to those people.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.395
Yeah. Glasses?

13:50.397 --> 13:51.896
That's different. Is it?

13:51.898 --> 13:53.031
You know what?
You guys are all getting

13:53.033 --> 13:54.465
all this feedback. How 'bout you

13:54.467 --> 13:55.400
give me some feedback?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.368
Well, it's a... slippery slope.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.405
No, come on. You guys can be
my focus group. It'll be so fun.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.906
We should do, like, another
Oh, no, no, I'm gonna pass

14:01.908 --> 14:03.908
family activity. On that one.
What? Why?

14:03.910 --> 14:05.276
Yeah, that's not a good one. What
are you ta... Okay, all right,

14:05.278 --> 14:07.078
well, then you guys
get out of here.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.546
I need to talk to your dad.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.082
What was that all about?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.084
You know, honey,
sometimes you...

14:13.086 --> 14:15.326
You know, you're not so good
at taking criticism.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.223
Oh.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.924
Yeah.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.759
(chuckles)

14:21.761 --> 14:24.229
Wow.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.264
I... Are you mad?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.266
DEAN SR.: <i>How many times
do I have to tell you?</i>

14:28.268 --> 14:31.436
I am not angry,
I'm just telling it like it is.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.338
It's not what's coming across,
apparently.

14:33.340 --> 14:36.841
Dad, there was another card
that we didn't tell you about.

14:36.843 --> 14:37.976
Oh, yeah? What'd it say?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.244
What are you hiding, Pop?

14:39.246 --> 14:40.311
What?

14:41.481 --> 14:44.415
I'm not hiding anything.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.418
Is that something
one of those mall people said?

14:47.420 --> 14:50.655
Yes, it's something
one of the mall people said.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.957
And we know they're never wrong.
We do?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.692
I'll wait here all day...

14:54.694 --> 14:57.395
until you tell me the truth.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.832
Yeah?

15:00.834 --> 15:03.001
Yeah.

15:06.206 --> 15:09.107
So, um, I couldn't help
but notice that you...

15:09.109 --> 15:11.209
you tested pretty high with
that focus group in there.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.311
Oh, I did? I don't
pay attention to that stuff.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.146
Because of that right there.
How do you do that?

15:15.148 --> 15:17.148
Do what? Just, like...

15:17.150 --> 15:18.816
not care about stuff.

15:18.818 --> 15:21.152
You know? I mean, I
internalize everything so much

15:21.154 --> 15:23.154
and it makes me insane.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.290
You're so chill all the time.
Do you have any...

15:25.292 --> 15:26.858
any tips?

15:26.860 --> 15:28.660
I don't know. I just kind of...

15:28.662 --> 15:30.061
do whatever.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.496
There it is again.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.131
Wow.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.565
(chuckles)

15:34.567 --> 15:36.501
I'm gonna walk away now, okay?

15:36.503 --> 15:38.536
Yeah, yeah.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.371
You guys are wasting your time.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.874
You're my sons,
I would tell you anything.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.642
I used to believe that,
but now I'm not so sure.

15:44.644 --> 15:45.977
Damn it, Dino.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.345
You would believe
a couple of strangers

15:47.347 --> 15:49.314
over your own father? I thought

15:49.316 --> 15:52.050
I brought you boys up
better than that.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.552
(door opens, then slams)

15:54.554 --> 15:56.634
That's great, Dean.
Now he's even angrier.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.691
It's even worse.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.693
He's telling the truth.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.394
How is that worse?

16:03.396 --> 16:04.696
(sighs heavily)

16:04.698 --> 16:07.732
I always thought the people
could never be wrong.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.167
I trusted them.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.002
I believed in them.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.071
And they were wrong.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.013
Hey, Dean!

16:22.015 --> 16:22.947
You have to get dressed.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.115
Dad's thing starts in an hour.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.416
Ah, what does it matter?

16:25.418 --> 16:26.884
Turns out six people in a mall

16:26.886 --> 16:28.453
don't have all the answers.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.722
Yeah, but you
had to know that, right?

16:30.724 --> 16:33.091
On some level?
I broke up with Sela Ward

16:33.093 --> 16:36.728
because a focus group rated our
on-screen chemistry as "fine."

16:36.730 --> 16:38.196
Okay.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.564
What's with the suit?

16:39.566 --> 16:42.400
What? Nothing.
Just a... just a suit.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.635
Just a suit? Yeah.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.437
You're taking the note,
aren't you?

16:46.439 --> 16:47.705
What? No. No. I...

16:47.707 --> 16:50.241
Don't. Stewart, you were right.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.777
The people can be wrong, and...

16:52.779 --> 16:54.212
I know that now.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.581
And maybe, just maybe,
they shouldn't be

16:56.583 --> 16:58.983
the ultimate authority on things
that they know nothing about.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.652
Or maybe there's
a middle ground, Dean,

17:01.654 --> 17:04.655
where we listen to them
and we just take what we need?

17:04.657 --> 17:07.058
You really are a dreamer,
aren't you?

17:07.060 --> 17:08.760
Don't ever lose that.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.995
Oh, I won't. Thank you.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.764
So you're really not going?

17:12.766 --> 17:14.298
(sighs heavily)
The system failed.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.334
It failed all of us.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.269
Mr. Sanderson,

17:18.271 --> 17:21.005
you are a... licensed attorney,
are you not?

17:21.007 --> 17:22.607
That's correct. Well, then, sir,

17:22.609 --> 17:25.076
tell me, from one lawyer

17:25.078 --> 17:27.311
to another lawyer...

17:28.415 --> 17:30.181
are you guilty?

17:30.183 --> 17:31.416
No, I'm not.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.918
Because the law clearly states

17:33.920 --> 17:36.487
that we are all innocent

17:36.489 --> 17:38.523
until proven guilty.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.024
Man, Stew's really going for it.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.292
What?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.127
Oh, you are just always on, huh?

17:43.129 --> 17:45.329
STEWART: Is it your opinion, Mr.
Sanderson,

17:45.331 --> 17:47.765
that you defended your client...

17:47.767 --> 17:49.467
to the best of your ability?

17:49.469 --> 17:51.135
You're damn right I did.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.304
Objection.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.673
Great answer.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.042
No, I'm glad you're
responding to it, Chad.

17:58.044 --> 18:01.012
No, I just, uh, woke up one
morning and thought, "Why not?"

18:01.014 --> 18:02.480
Who's she talking to?

18:02.482 --> 18:04.282
Chad Oseroff. He likes her hair.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.684
He's been calling her non-stop.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.555
Lizzie, hang up the phone. What?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.390
Hang up the phone.
No. Why? Sorry, my uncle's

18:12.392 --> 18:14.192
being weird. I don't know
what's going on. Uncle Dean,

18:14.194 --> 18:16.294
what are you doing?
Okay, bye, Chad,

18:16.296 --> 18:17.895
I'll call you back. No, she
won't, no, she will not.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.664
I don't want you talking
to that young man anymore.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.200
Why? Your cards worked.
I made an adjustment

18:22.202 --> 18:24.302
based on the notes
and now that boy likes me.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.803
It's a fluke.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.738
The system isn't foolproof.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.675
Notes don't always
make things better.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.744
Uncle Dean, all my cards came
back positive. Are they wrong?

18:33.746 --> 18:36.581
They may be, Ethan. They may be.

18:37.917 --> 18:41.686
Oh, Dad, what have I done?

18:41.688 --> 18:42.687
Where are you going?

18:42.689 --> 18:45.056
To put a stop to this.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.325
'Cause I don't think
anybody else can.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.927
I-Is anyone else trying to?

18:49.929 --> 18:51.896
Then why weren't you
able to get him off?

18:51.898 --> 18:54.098
Was it because of
all the drinking?

18:54.100 --> 18:56.367
Or do you not even remember
because you were

18:56.369 --> 18:58.102
too drunk to know
the difference?

18:58.104 --> 19:00.671
Drunk? No. Are you sure?

19:00.673 --> 19:03.174
I did my best, all right?
It's complicated!

19:03.176 --> 19:04.509
What do you want to hear?

19:04.511 --> 19:06.377
It's complicated? Dad, what...

19:06.379 --> 19:07.879
what happened?

19:07.881 --> 19:10.448
Maybe I screwed up.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.185
I didn't bring the deal to Cory.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.254
I just took it.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.789
Oh, crap. Wow.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.592
Even when care
it still feels like you don't.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.994
It's amazing. (Door opens)

19:23.630 --> 19:25.429
Stop. Stop.

19:25.431 --> 19:26.597
This isn't right. No, Dean,

19:26.599 --> 19:27.632
we al... No, no, no, no,

19:27.634 --> 19:29.967
Stewart, look around you.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.403
Look at who we're listening to.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.205
Randos from the mall.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.907
You brought them here. Yes, yes,

19:35.909 --> 19:38.309
I brought them here.
Because I've been living my life

19:38.311 --> 19:40.278
based on comment cards
from groups

19:40.280 --> 19:41.779
just like this one,

19:41.781 --> 19:43.915
and it's been a mistake.
We should be able

19:43.917 --> 19:46.817
to make mistakes.
We shouldn't have to be flawless

19:46.819 --> 19:48.252
all the time, so focus groups

19:48.254 --> 19:50.555
like every single thing
about us.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.223
Yes, but Dean, you were right.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.126
The focus group was right.
Dad just admitted

19:55.128 --> 19:56.594
that he was hiding something.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.996
What? Yeah, and I feel
a lot better now.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.338
I knew they couldn't be wrong.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.946
DEAN SR: You were right, Dino.
The testing process is flawless.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.614
And order is restored.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.482
I'm so relieved.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.984
Yeah, we all are.
Okay, but how do we

20:19.986 --> 20:23.154
deal with the fact that,
um, Dad is guilty?

20:23.156 --> 20:26.290
Stewart, can we take one moment
to luxuriate in the glory of it?

20:26.292 --> 20:27.458
The glory of what?

20:27.460 --> 20:28.926
The cards.

I... I don't really care.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.551
Even if they didn't buy me
as a lawyer, so what?

20:53.553 --> 20:57.054
I am one.
And that's what really matters.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.457
Yeah, but they<i> did</i> buy you
as one, and that matters more.

Hm. Mom may not take
action against us

21:15.408 --> 21:17.575
if Mom does not like
something she hears.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.143
Got it. Gimme. You sure, honey?

21:19.145 --> 21:20.411
'Cause you can still back out.

What? No. Come on, bring it.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.748

No, no. No.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.665

21:40.667 --> 21:43.034

I got a bunch of stuff on it.
