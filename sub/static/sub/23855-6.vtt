WEBVTT

00:16.516 --> 00:20.145
Do you recall seeing this seagull
at the scene?

00:22.814 --> 00:24.149
I don't recall seeing that, ma'am.

00:24.232 --> 00:27.193
It was right there.
I saw it, everyone saw it. Okay?

00:27.277 --> 00:28.403
You must have too.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.989
I don't recall seeing that
at the scene of the crime.

00:31.072 --> 00:35.952
Do you recall seeing anyone
not on this list at the scene?

00:36.286 --> 00:38.997
-I don't recall.
-Any undercovers, any plainclothes guys?

00:39.080 --> 00:41.041
Anybody who didn't have business
being there?

00:41.124 --> 00:42.083
I don't recall.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.002
What about seeing a blue vehicle
at the scene?

00:44.085 --> 00:47.839
-I don't recall.
-The victim crawled around in the snow,

00:47.922 --> 00:49.758
bleeding out, for 12 hours.

00:54.387 --> 01:00.351
Do you recall seeing anyone
not on this list at the scene?

01:02.145 --> 01:03.438
[Fish] He was 15 years old.

01:04.314 --> 01:07.859
He would have survived
if someone had gotten him some care.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.864
I'm hoping if you give yourself
a little time to think it over, you might.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.326
I, uh...

01:16.409 --> 01:17.410
I...

01:18.411 --> 01:21.623
-There were a lot of people on the scene--
-All right, time's up.

01:21.706 --> 01:22.916
You can go, Officer.

01:22.999 --> 01:26.336
-You saw someone there not on that list?
-I said we're done.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.174
-Your time's up.
-We've got more questions.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.260
Yeah, there was a time limit
and I've been more than accommodating.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.887
Get out of my office.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.724
I think he likes me. Maybe he'll invite me
to join Bowling League.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.851
[KJ]
Fuck Medina. Connelly calls the shots.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.896
Two hours to interview every cop at
the scene? Lot of pull your buddy's got.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.023
At least we got access
to district records.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.734
Find out what DiAngelo and his team drives
and what they were doing

01:49.818 --> 01:52.529
-the morning of the hit-and-run.
-What are you gonna be doing?

01:52.612 --> 01:53.863
Finding that blue car.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.450
[protestors] No justice, no peace!
Justice for Brenton Butler!

01:57.534 --> 02:00.703
No justice, no peace!
Justice for Brenton Butler!

02:00.787 --> 02:02.705
-No justice, no peace!
-Let's go!

02:02.789 --> 02:04.290
Justice for Brenton Butler!

02:04.374 --> 02:07.669
No justice, no peace!
Justice for Brenton Butler!

02:07.752 --> 02:09.504
No justice, no peace!

03:16.362 --> 03:18.198
[machinery thudding]

03:18.948 --> 03:20.867
[machinery whirring]

03:24.203 --> 03:25.204
[groaning]

03:28.124 --> 03:29.125
[sighs]

03:45.058 --> 03:46.184
[exhales]

03:50.980 --> 03:52.732
[church organ plays]

03:54.984 --> 03:59.239
Michael, the Christian community
welcomes you with great joy.

04:05.828 --> 04:11.209
Michael, I baptize you
in the name of the Father, and of the Son,

04:11.834 --> 04:13.419
and of the Holy Spirit.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.006
We now anoint you
with the holy oil of salvation

04:17.090 --> 04:18.967
in the name of Christ, our Savior.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.510
All rise, please.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.433
[all] Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

04:27.850 --> 04:32.355
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.316
Give us this day our daily bread,

04:35.400 --> 04:37.652
and forgive us our trespasses,

04:37.735 --> 04:40.822
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.324
And lead us not into temptation,

04:43.408 --> 04:45.201
but deliver us from evil.

04:47.495 --> 04:51.916
[priest] Deliver us, Lord, from every evil
and grant us peace in our day.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.128
In your mercy, keep us free from sin...

04:55.211 --> 04:56.296
So cute.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.631
I'm gonna put a baby in you
when we get to my place.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.717
-What? God, shut up!
-I'm gonna put ten thousand...

05:00.800 --> 05:03.553
-Everyone's gonna hear you, you perv!
-...million babies in you.

05:03.636 --> 05:07.223
We gotta go, babe. The restaurant's
got the food out already, they called.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.309
Go ahead, all of you. You, uh...

05:10.143 --> 05:12.937
get her and the baby there.
We're gonna talk shop here a minute.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.439
Oh, come on, Mike, not today.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.982
You heard me. Go.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.651
Let's go. Come on.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.240
Wilcox.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.207
-[Wilcox] Hey.
-I owe you an apology.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.336
That wasn't right
what I said the other day.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.589
Acting like fucking amateurs, me included.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.011
Ain't nothing to worry about.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.432
We got paperwork alibiing us.
It's all worked out.

05:49.515 --> 05:53.352
Petey, hang back at your house
for a couple of days till this blows over.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.563
Enjoy your wife and kid.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.191
What about the witness?

06:03.696 --> 06:04.906
I took care of it.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.496
-What the fuck you talking about?
-I said I fucking took care of it.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.457
[sirens wailing in distance]

06:19.003 --> 06:20.046
[car honks]

06:20.713 --> 06:23.549
-[Teresa] You coming or what?
-Yeah, yeah, we're coming. We're coming.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.516
I'm fucking hungry. Let's go. Let's eat.
I'm gonna go with you and Teresa.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.071
Don't act like you don't fucking know
what he was talking about.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.663
Who else is out there
we gotta take care of? Hmm?

06:54.413 --> 06:55.414
Who's next?

07:05.716 --> 07:09.011
How am I supposed to trust the cops
and the prosecutor

07:09.095 --> 07:12.265
to find justice for my son
when they think he's a criminal?

07:13.266 --> 07:16.727
Look, here's the deal, Mrs. Butler.
There's still a lot of work to be done.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.856
We can look into a civil suit.
File for damages.

07:19.939 --> 07:23.192
But the most important thing, and this is
what most families want really,

07:23.276 --> 07:26.571
is for the record to reflect
what happened to their loved ones.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.533
I knew when I read about
how you helped those families...

07:31.909 --> 07:33.411
I knew you'd understand.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.040
But, um, I gotta tell you something. I...

07:39.459 --> 07:42.378
I don't have money to pay you,
but I will get it. I promise.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.048
No, that won't be necessary.
We can work on a contingency basis.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.010
My last jury award, I was able
to get the family close to five million.

07:49.093 --> 07:53.473
Your son being left out there for what,
12 hours of suffering?

07:54.098 --> 07:56.392
We can probably argue
close to ten for that.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.730
I don't care about the money.
It's not about that.

08:00.813 --> 08:05.485
It's about the fact that Brenton's killer
is out there, living his life,

08:05.985 --> 08:07.403
like he didn't take away my baby's.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.155
I know you don't care about the money.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.908
But this is how you make them pay,

08:11.991 --> 08:14.494
dollar by dollar for what they did.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.371
Can I ask you a tough question?

08:19.207 --> 08:20.041
Yeah.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.752
Did Brenton have any kind of a record?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.713
It's-- It's best I know everything now.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.006
He was a good boy.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.843
He came from a good home.
His father and I...

08:32.178 --> 08:34.931
I never had to worry about Brenton
that way.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.350
And what about his father?

08:38.309 --> 08:40.394
Presentation is important to these juries.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.523
I'd like to have you both
in the event we go to trial.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.524
Okay.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.193
Yeah.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.531
You have a...

08:52.782 --> 08:55.284
I'm sorry.
You have a little something on your, uh...

08:57.161 --> 09:00.081
Oh, um, yeah, I was, um...

09:00.164 --> 09:01.374
I was drinking some coffee,

09:01.457 --> 09:05.044
trying to get all the ins and outs
to this legal jargon.

09:05.127 --> 09:08.005
Here's the thing, Mrs. Butler.
I don't mean to embarrass you.

09:08.965 --> 09:13.427
It's details like that
that can be very important to a jury.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.306
I really appreciate
you being honest with me.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.979
[indistinct chatter]

09:26.857 --> 09:28.985
Another one for the bullshit column.

09:29.068 --> 09:32.905
People hate the police. Lots of bitching
and moaning, but nothing relevant.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.407
I'll decide what's relevant.

09:35.950 --> 09:39.161
I want in on all tips on the blue car
when you log them.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.413
Be my guest.

09:41.998 --> 09:42.957
Thanks.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.090
A wise use
of my office's limited resources.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.760
How's the search
for the mystery blue car coming?

09:54.844 --> 09:55.678
Fine.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.346
That's great.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.683
Because I got every reporter
in a 50-mile radius up my ass.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.394
I need to hire a crime scene expert.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.938
I need the make and the model
of this car.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.733
Who's gonna pay for that? You?

10:08.816 --> 10:09.859
[sighs]

10:17.825 --> 10:20.870
The National Association of Police
just dropped their endorsement.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.540
This isn't about your campaign.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.543
No, it is not.
And thanks to you, that is probably over.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.714
When all this settles, I don't imagine
you're going to fare much better, KJ.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.632
[scoffs]

10:33.299 --> 10:36.135
My career prospects
aren't my first concern.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.888
-And I intend to win.
-With what?

10:40.056 --> 10:42.141
Publicly handcuffing me
to your powder keg?

10:44.393 --> 10:46.687
I should've pulled the plug on this
a long time ago.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.279
[Fish clears throat]

11:03.079 --> 11:05.081
DiAngelo's team was
on a routine search and seizure

11:05.164 --> 11:06.999
the morning of the hit-and-run.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.085
So, they have an alibi.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.254
-This is good news?
-No, just read the report.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.339
[KJ sighs]

11:16.467 --> 11:19.762
Yeah, uh, this is Officer Felix Osorio
from the South District,

11:19.845 --> 11:21.514
badge number eight-zero-two-zero.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.850
Listen, I need a Cause
and a Manner of Death

11:24.934 --> 11:26.519
on a white Jane Doe junkie.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.689
She's around 14 to 16 years old,
got a purple streak in her hair,

11:30.773 --> 11:32.942
might've come into the morgue
yesterday or today.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.780
No one matching that description came in?
You sure?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.200
Because I got a solid from a CI
she was found. Check again.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.619
[Fish] Sneaky motherfucker.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.415
I know what's going on.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.461
Asshole pours the last cup of coffee,

11:52.545 --> 11:54.588
then walks away,
leaving the rest of us high and dry.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.299
It happens every time,
and now I know it's you.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.552
Fuck you, rat bitch.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.639
Yeah, sure, but before that, where were
you on the morning of February 15?

12:04.056 --> 12:06.934
[Osorio] You want to talk to me, IA?
Get with my union rep or Medina.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.562
[Fish] Got the paperwork
on your unit's whereabouts that morning.

12:09.645 --> 12:13.607
It says here that DiAngelo and Wilcox
were on a controlled buy operation

12:13.691 --> 12:14.733
near the park.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.571
[sighs] You're not in this report.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.492
You're the only one without an alibi.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.581
I know. My thoughts exactly.
Fucking rat bitches, right?

12:29.582 --> 12:32.168
And DiAngelo wrote this paperwork up.

12:37.965 --> 12:42.261
You know, it's not too late to talk
before they pin this whole thing on you.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.014
Fuck you.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.056
Nah...

12:46.140 --> 12:48.684
You're the one that's getting fucked,
my friend. Got two choices.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.145
Either talk, or you spend
the rest of your days behind bars

12:51.228 --> 12:53.814
taking shits in front of guys
that you locked up.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.487
Who was driving the car?

13:01.780 --> 13:02.865
It wasn't you, right?

13:05.159 --> 13:07.536
So why the fuck do you care?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.293
Anyway, you can keep that, I got a copy.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.009
[whispers] Don't worry. Shh.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.933
[sighs]

13:30.601 --> 13:32.102
[rap music plays]

13:34.730 --> 13:36.398
[whistles]

13:37.816 --> 13:39.235
[whistles]

13:58.254 --> 13:59.505
Seth Butler?

14:00.005 --> 14:02.591
Peaches Tally.
Damn girl, it's been a minute.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.469
I thought you was up and out of here,
serving the country or whatever.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.099
Didn't know you had babies.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.309
[Peaches] Yeah, they're my everything.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.229
And smart too.
Don't know where they get it from.

14:15.312 --> 14:18.857
Nah, they get it from you. They quick
with the comebacks, I remember.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.529
I'm sorry about your nephew.
I wanted to be at the funeral but...

14:24.822 --> 14:26.490
It's just so sad, ain't it?

14:26.574 --> 14:29.910
I mean, first she lose her child,
and now Tricey be living in her car.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.746
You seen Latrice living in her car?

14:33.205 --> 14:36.584
Yeah, near us by the Family Dollar
parking lot on MLK.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.713
What you think? Hook up an old friend?

14:40.796 --> 14:42.381
Yo, what's taking so damn long?

14:43.048 --> 14:44.592
This ain't no damn high school reunion.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.927
She was just leaving.
Go on. We ain't got nothing for you.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.847
-Get home with them babies--
-Fuck that noise. Shit ain't up to you.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.974
What, you think you better than me?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.268
I want my shit right quick.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.104
Go cop from Henny.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.486
You were going soft for that hoe.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.740
You see what she do with them kids
in the car?

15:08.157 --> 15:11.076
I heard she suck Lif Bux's dick
right in front of them.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.581
She don't get it from us, she's going
to get it from somebody else.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.666
Fuck that bitch.

[horn honks]

46:07.097 --> 46:08.682
Brenton worked the corner too?

46:11.435 --> 46:13.562
He wasn't really cut out for this neither.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.572
Talked about you though.

46:24.781 --> 46:25.949
From time to time.

46:26.533 --> 46:27.534
He worried.

46:30.245 --> 46:31.997
With you being over there and all.

46:37.544 --> 46:38.795
B had heart.

46:38.879 --> 46:39.796
Mm-hmm.

46:41.715 --> 46:43.884
Wasn't ever scared to share
how he was feeling.

46:47.930 --> 46:50.849
That's bravery, being like that, man.

46:51.683 --> 46:53.227
More than this shit out here.

47:00.234 --> 47:01.443
[speaking Spanish]

47:04.071 --> 47:05.739
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

47:06.448 --> 47:09.493
Listen, I got cash stashed at the house.

47:10.118 --> 47:11.203
You hear me, Ma?

47:11.995 --> 47:15.290
A stack behind the vent in the living room
and another one behind my bed.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.459
That's for you. Okay?

47:17.543 --> 47:20.420
You can pay the bills for the next
six months, you don't gotta worry.

47:21.380 --> 47:24.550
No, look, I can't talk no more,
I gotta go.

47:25.467 --> 47:28.178
Just make sure you give half of it
to Jasmine, okay?

47:30.806 --> 47:31.765
Don't worry.

47:32.849 --> 47:33.767
<i>Mami...</i>

47:34.893 --> 47:36.270
Don't cry.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.313
Okay. I just gotta take care of something.

47:39.481 --> 47:41.858
I'll call you. Okay.

47:41.942 --> 47:43.026
[speaking Spanish]

47:49.157 --> 47:51.034
[pop music plays inside]

47:58.834 --> 47:59.835
[Nadine laughs]

48:07.384 --> 48:08.218
[music stops]

48:11.597 --> 48:14.725
Hey. What are you doing here?

48:17.603 --> 48:18.604
I, uh...

48:19.688 --> 48:20.689
I want to talk.

48:24.109 --> 48:24.985
Okay.

48:27.863 --> 48:29.114
Got your kid in there?

48:30.240 --> 48:31.408
No, I'm alone.

48:36.913 --> 48:40.751
I want my deal in writing from
the assistant prosecutor before I talk.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.545
That's fair. I'll call her.

48:46.256 --> 48:47.841
Uh, let's, uh...

48:48.675 --> 48:49.885
let's meet at her office.

48:53.096 --> 48:55.223
Wait here? I'll drive.
I gotta get my coat.

48:56.391 --> 48:58.727
Nah. I, uh... I'll see you there.

48:58.810 --> 49:00.187
Okay, it's on Newark Avenue.

49:00.270 --> 49:02.147
-Yeah, I know where it is.
-Hey, Osorio.

49:05.734 --> 49:07.027
You're doing the right thing.

49:24.127 --> 49:25.003
Who was that?

49:25.754 --> 49:28.590
-We need to get you out of here now.
-What? No. I want to stay.

49:28.674 --> 49:31.802
Nadine, this isn't time to fuck around.
I'm serious. Put your shoes on.

49:31.885 --> 49:33.470
-Now!
-Okay.

49:39.601 --> 49:42.854
KJ, you're not gonna believe this.
We've got the weak link.

49:42.938 --> 49:44.064
[laughs]

50:28.692 --> 50:30.777
Are you good, Nadine? I gotta get going.

50:37.784 --> 50:39.703
What, you got some lady troubles or...

50:40.787 --> 50:42.205
a little indigestion?

50:43.165 --> 50:44.791
[light rustling]

50:47.669 --> 50:49.880
-What's happening in there? What--?
-[door locks]

50:50.505 --> 50:53.050
[tries doorknob]
Oh, no, no, no, no. Hey, hey!

50:53.592 --> 50:56.428
I gotta get moving! Hey! Open the--

50:57.345 --> 50:58.930
[rattles doorknob] You-- Ohh.

51:06.772 --> 51:08.273
Give me that shit. What?

51:08.356 --> 51:10.942
Give it back, motherfucker!
I'm not gonna testify if you don't!

51:11.026 --> 51:12.694
Not letting you shoot this
into your veins!

51:12.778 --> 51:14.070
-I don't shoot, I smoke.
-Okay.

51:14.154 --> 51:16.615
-It's not a big deal. Give it--
-Yeah. Knock it off!

51:16.698 --> 51:18.950
Just lie down, watch some TV,
do some fucking thing.

51:21.995 --> 51:23.914
What are you doing? What--
I'm talking to you!

51:23.997 --> 51:24.998
[phone shatters]

51:27.083 --> 51:28.418
What the hell was that?

51:31.505 --> 51:32.923
-I see you.
-Huh?

51:33.006 --> 51:35.217
Looking at me, checking me out.
You want to fuck me?

51:35.300 --> 51:36.510
No. Nadine.

51:36.593 --> 51:38.345
-Got a real tight snatch.
-That's disgusting!

51:38.428 --> 51:40.055
-Will you knock it off?
-I don't care!

51:40.138 --> 51:41.681
-I want my shit!
-No.

51:41.765 --> 51:46.019
Give me my shit!
Give me my shit, you fucking old fuck!

51:46.102 --> 51:47.395
Stop!

51:47.479 --> 51:48.396
Stop.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.273
[sobbing]

51:52.984 --> 51:54.694
Stop. Shh, shh. It's okay.

51:56.655 --> 51:57.614
[whispers] Please.

51:58.949 --> 52:01.076
Please, I'll do whatever you want. Okay?

52:01.159 --> 52:03.203
-I'll testify. I just-- You have to--
-Shh.

52:04.120 --> 52:07.666
-You have to help me 'cause I'm gonna die.
-No, you're not.

52:07.999 --> 52:10.710
Just once. Just one more time
and then I'm done. I'm done.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.212
-I promise, okay?
-I can't do that.

52:12.295 --> 52:13.630
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

52:15.966 --> 52:16.842
[screams]

52:16.925 --> 52:19.052
Want the police to find you,
want him to find you?

52:19.135 --> 52:20.804
What's the matter with you? Ow! God!

52:20.887 --> 52:22.430
[screaming]

52:22.514 --> 52:25.892
Okay, okay, take it! Here, take it!
You want to do it, go do it!

52:28.019 --> 52:28.854
[lock clicks]

52:29.271 --> 52:30.939
[panting]

52:40.574 --> 52:41.741
[faucet runs]

52:41.825 --> 52:43.326
[doorbell ringing repeatedly]

52:44.828 --> 52:46.830
What the fuck, bro? It's mad late, man.

52:48.206 --> 52:51.209
DiAngelo lied. He didn't kill her.

52:51.918 --> 52:53.295
The witness, the girl...

52:54.421 --> 52:55.589
she's still alive.

52:56.464 --> 52:59.926
I saw her leaving Fish's house.
He's got her. We gotta turn 'em in.

53:00.427 --> 53:02.679
Tell 'em Jablonski did it
and DiAngelo had us cover it up.

53:02.762 --> 53:05.098
-Get the fuck out of here, bro.
-Listen to me, listen to me.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.643
DiAngelo's lost his fucking mind
and you know it.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.103
It's up to us.

53:10.854 --> 53:12.188
We gotta tell Medina.

53:12.981 --> 53:15.150
Or else we're going to prison
for something they did.

53:15.233 --> 53:16.401
I ain't going nowhere.

53:19.154 --> 53:19.988
I got insurance.

53:21.364 --> 53:22.866
What the fuck you talking about?

53:23.491 --> 53:26.828
Got rid of his fucking truck, but
Jablonski forgot about the grill guard.

53:26.912 --> 53:29.623
DiAngelo told me to throw it in the trunk,
throw it in the river.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.124
Fuck that.

53:31.917 --> 53:33.043
I kept it.

53:35.170 --> 53:37.214
Still got blood on it too. [chuckles]

53:37.714 --> 53:42.552
You don't gotta worry about that witness.
Jablonski's the one who's fucked. Not us.

53:45.138 --> 53:46.640
So fuck both of them.

53:48.850 --> 53:50.143
It's me and you now.

53:52.479 --> 53:57.067
Fish, where are you? Where's Osorio?
I've been waiting here for hours.

53:58.193 --> 54:00.070
Just-- [sighs] What's going on?

54:02.906 --> 54:03.740
[exhales]

54:03.823 --> 54:04.783
Fuck.

54:15.710 --> 54:16.753
[KJ sighs]

54:19.130 --> 54:19.965
Where's your guy?

54:21.716 --> 54:22.842
He's not here...

54:23.510 --> 54:24.511
yet.

54:26.262 --> 54:27.681
It's been over three hours.

54:28.682 --> 54:29.557
I know.

54:31.101 --> 54:32.435
He get cold feet?

54:32.519 --> 54:35.939
No. No, that--
that's not what's happening.

54:36.356 --> 54:37.816
Fish swore he'd be here.

54:41.528 --> 54:42.946
Why didn't he bring him himself?

54:46.157 --> 54:47.409
It's complicated.

54:50.328 --> 54:51.162
[KJ exhales]

54:51.246 --> 54:53.415
Witnesses go south all the time.
You know that.

54:53.498 --> 54:55.333
This is supposed to be over.

54:56.042 --> 54:58.294
-It was so close.
-KJ.

54:58.378 --> 55:01.131
It's all so fucked.
It's all falling apart.

55:01.214 --> 55:02.215
Stop.

55:02.757 --> 55:07.012
I can't. I can't fail.
There is too much riding on this.

55:07.095 --> 55:08.805
You lost the battle, not the war.

55:09.431 --> 55:11.683
Okay, I've been where you are
dozens of times.

55:13.518 --> 55:16.855
-I don't need the self-help talk.
-You are a good lawyer, KJ.

55:17.522 --> 55:18.982
You're doing a good thing.

55:19.065 --> 55:23.153
Even if you make things complicated
for me. This is the KJ I know.

55:23.653 --> 55:24.654
A fighter.

55:54.184 --> 55:55.435
[rap music playing]

56:21.252 --> 56:22.128
[Latrice] Um...

56:28.510 --> 56:30.929
I'm-- I'm sorry about how I spoke to you.

56:33.056 --> 56:34.224
I didn't mean it.

56:35.850 --> 56:36.851
It's just--

56:36.935 --> 56:42.148
It's just that each day I wake up
and it lands on me.

56:43.191 --> 56:45.944
Every day, like it's the first time,
and I just...

56:46.027 --> 56:47.153
[breath quavering]

56:47.237 --> 56:48.863
I can't stand it.

56:54.202 --> 56:55.578
I know who he is.

57:02.001 --> 57:04.587
I know where he lives,
I know where he works.

57:06.089 --> 57:07.423
I know his name.

57:20.186 --> 57:22.105
I need you to get me a gun.

57:25.859 --> 57:28.445
I need to kill the man
that killed my child.
