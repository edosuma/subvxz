It was one of those days.

00:22.521 --> 00:25.524
It was definitely
one of those days.

00:26.443 --> 00:39.244
I hate those days.

00:39.246 --> 00:41.080
Was yesterday your birthday?

00:41.082 --> 00:42.790
Looks more like your friends.

00:42.792 --> 00:43.623
Well, you threw a party.

00:49.256 --> 00:50.091
Watch this.

00:52.634 --> 00:55.345
- The party's over.
- Let's go.

01:06.816 --> 01:07.648
Eagle's Nest.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.359
This is Archangel.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.651
Do you copy?

01:10.653 --> 01:11.735
Did he put you on hold?

01:14.740 --> 01:16.240
ETA over
head, one minute.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.534
You said that an
hour ago, you ass.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.329
Sorry, Archangel.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.082
I'm gettin' a little
tired of this shit, Skip.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.832
You know what our
problem is, don't you?

01:26.835 --> 01:28.460
Please enlighten me.

01:28.462 --> 01:29.921
We keep comin' back.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.255
But I like that part.

01:31.257 --> 01:35.175
Archangel, heavy
load inbound on mark.

01:35.177 --> 01:36.719
Negative, not on mark.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.011
What?

01:38.013 --> 01:42.141
Cossidy, five,
zero, zero, over.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.813
Traffic load on mark.

01:51.611 --> 01:59.574
In five, four, three, two.

02:06.751 --> 02:07.916
Archangel.

02:07.918 --> 02:09.419
Archangel, come in.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.964
Archangel, come in, over.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.156
Well, he's here.

02:39.158 --> 02:40.991
What ever gave you that idea?

02:40.993 --> 02:43.204
You know, it's
a soldier thing.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.290
I can sense it.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.315
Roger, honey.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.400
Will you make the
bad thing go away?

03:15.402 --> 03:17.864
Don't worry, Mindy'll get it.

03:20.282 --> 03:22.576
I thought you were Mindy.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.955
Oh, hi Tony.

03:27.039 --> 03:28.498
Roger's asleep.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.291
He told me to tell
you he's not here.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.875
My bad.

03:31.877 --> 03:33.460
God, what was I thinking?

03:33.462 --> 03:36.756
It's like the crack of three.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.256
Come in.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.555
Eyes above deck, soldier.

03:44.139 --> 03:45.097
We're here, you know,

03:45.099 --> 03:46.141
when in Rome.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.143
Oh, you poor bastard.

03:50.145 --> 03:51.689
You must hate your life.

03:53.274 --> 03:56.608
Hey, Tony.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.112
Roger.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.155
Roger?

04:01.157 --> 04:02.489
Roger!

04:02.491 --> 04:05.159
It's time to wake
up and go to work.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.494
You gave me two weeks off.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.495
Yeah, and it's
been three weeks.

04:08.497 --> 04:09.331
Whatcha been up to?

04:10.750 --> 04:13.875
Yeah, all play and no work
makes for bad business, buddy.

04:13.877 --> 04:14.372
Time to go.

04:45.412 --> 04:47.287
Who invited us to what dance?

04:47.289 --> 04:49.457
The question I've been
waiting for you to ask.

04:49.459 --> 04:52.043
Your ex-uncle.

04:52.045 --> 04:53.628
- What?
- Don't worry.

04:53.630 --> 04:56.546
There won't be any army brass
or any politics, I swear.

04:56.548 --> 04:57.882
We don't...

04:57.884 --> 05:00.176
Just because we're
not working for them

05:00.178 --> 05:02.096
doesn't mean we
can't take referrals.

05:03.014 --> 05:04.430
Fine.

05:04.432 --> 05:07.683
Tony, you really should
come visit us more often.

05:07.685 --> 05:08.935
There's a good idea.

05:10.104 --> 05:11.230
Five minutes.

05:13.565 --> 05:14.606
He say five minutes?

05:14.608 --> 05:16.609
That is
not long enough.

05:19.279 --> 05:20.570
One of them's
like the good one,

05:20.572 --> 05:21.823
and one of them's
the evil one, right?

05:21.825 --> 05:24.950
You got a guy here who's
on his third divorce.

05:24.952 --> 05:26.702
She took everything fun from me.

05:26.704 --> 05:28.912
I live vicariously through you.

05:28.914 --> 05:31.082
That bitch actually
took the ice cube trays

05:31.084 --> 05:31.998
from the freezer, didn't she?

05:32.000 --> 05:32.835
Ah ha ha.

05:34.503 --> 05:35.962
Who's the guy we're meeting?

05:35.964 --> 05:37.171
His name is Carter.

05:37.173 --> 05:40.590
He works for a big
military subcontractor.

05:40.592 --> 05:41.883
He's a problem with
one of the countries

05:41.885 --> 05:43.344
we helped liberate
a few years ago.

05:43.346 --> 05:45.805
You may have to narrow
that down a little bit.

05:45.807 --> 05:47.640
It's north of the Stands,

05:47.642 --> 05:49.392
west of the Iron Curtain.

05:49.394 --> 05:50.767
Think Kosovo.

05:50.769 --> 05:53.688
It's civil war, genocide,
under duress, the usual shit.

05:53.690 --> 05:55.856
- Oh yeah, one of them.
- Yeah.

05:55.858 --> 05:57.483
Oh, thank you, darling.

05:57.485 --> 05:59.484
Thank you.

05:59.486 --> 06:01.611
When in Rome, go with it.

06:01.613 --> 06:03.115
You had enough.

06:04.659 --> 06:05.866
All right, it's
time to shape up.

06:05.868 --> 06:08.661
I'll handle the
introductions, okay?

06:08.663 --> 06:10.121
Anthony Carter,

06:10.123 --> 06:13.293
I'd like to introduce
you to Roger Steinrich,

06:14.418 --> 06:15.543
and of course, you
remember the delightful

06:15.545 --> 06:17.544
and lovely Heather.

06:17.546 --> 06:20.548
Yes, Miss Cartwright.

06:20.550 --> 06:21.673
Pleasure to see you again.

06:21.675 --> 06:22.549
Good evening, Mr. Carter.

06:22.551 --> 06:24.260
It's good to see you.

06:24.262 --> 06:25.555
I've heard a lot about you.

06:27.223 --> 06:30.183
You seem like you might be
the right man for the job.

06:30.185 --> 06:32.851
You have a little
problem for me to solve.

06:32.853 --> 06:35.313
Well,
I'm sure your colleagues

06:35.315 --> 06:36.938
have already briefed you,

06:36.940 --> 06:40.484
but yes, my company was
contracted by the local government

06:40.486 --> 06:47.157
to assist in setting up a
certain infrastructure, security.

06:47.159 --> 06:49.577
Some folks used to call
it nation building,

06:49.579 --> 06:52.037
before those became dirty words.

06:52.039 --> 06:53.580
The past six months,

06:53.582 --> 06:57.375
a criminal gang has knocked off

06:57.377 --> 06:59.796
quite a large number
of our people.

06:59.798 --> 07:01.798
And the local UN can't help?

07:01.800 --> 07:04.674
Yeah.

07:04.676 --> 07:08.178
Well, they're just
there as observers.

07:08.180 --> 07:09.389
The blue hats,

07:11.517 --> 07:13.476
they don't like to shoot guns.

07:13.478 --> 07:15.645
And you thought
it a brilliant idea

07:15.647 --> 07:19.651
to outsource this little
problem to us, because?

07:21.569 --> 07:26.572
Because the lovely Miss
Cartwright did a good job of

07:26.574 --> 07:27.992
selling us on your team.

07:29.327 --> 07:30.161
Did she now?

07:31.286 --> 07:33.038
That woman will say
the strangest things.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.207
Are there any more questions?

07:36.209 --> 07:37.416
When do you need us to leave?

07:37.418 --> 07:38.252
Tomorrow,

07:39.462 --> 07:43.005
assuming the captain
isn't too hungover.

07:43.007 --> 07:44.257
I'm good.

07:44.259 --> 07:46.010
Or as soon as you
can round up your team.

07:48.012 --> 07:49.471
- All right.
- Time to go.

07:51.890 --> 07:53.640
Any chance we could just start

07:53.642 --> 07:56.145
by hiring the bad
guys like we used to?

07:58.188 --> 08:01.274
Yeah, no problem.

08:01.276 --> 08:03.069
Have a good evening.

08:07.406 --> 08:08.656
Here you go, guys.

08:09.743 --> 08:10.702
- Thank you, miss.
- You're welcome.

08:12.829 --> 08:14.036
Here's your ginger ale, hon.

08:14.038 --> 08:15.455
Thank you, darlin'.

08:15.457 --> 08:16.748
Ginger ale?
Hold it. Wait, wait, wait.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.711
What exactly in this
good book of yours

08:21.296 --> 08:23.003
is to say you can't drink
with your buddies no more?

08:23.005 --> 08:25.046
Remember the bond, the
brotherhood we had?

08:25.048 --> 08:26.675
We used to tear this city down.

08:28.719 --> 08:30.262
It's not that specific, Red,

08:31.055 --> 08:32.179
and besides,

08:32.182 --> 08:33.015
there's drinking,

08:33.849 --> 08:35.183
and there's gettin' drunk.

08:38.687 --> 08:40.020
Aren't you the intellectual?

08:40.022 --> 08:41.647
You guys, what's the
matter with Blondie there?

08:41.649 --> 08:42.647
Newbie.

08:42.649 --> 08:44.107
Can't hold a beer anymore?

08:44.110 --> 08:45.693
Don't you still
need a training manual

08:45.695 --> 08:47.111
to hold your pecker?

08:47.113 --> 08:49.988
Pecker.

08:49.990 --> 08:53.241
At least I don't need a
penicillin every month to hold it.

08:53.243 --> 08:54.534
Shit.

08:54.536 --> 08:56.245
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:56.247 --> 08:57.496
Get out of here, Newbie.

08:57.498 --> 09:09.217
- Just a kid.
- You're right.

09:09.219 --> 09:11.095
Maybe it's something
that we say?

09:12.222 --> 09:15.014
Hell no.

09:15.016 --> 09:20.021
Not at all.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.483
Oh, they're not even fighting.

09:26.485 --> 09:27.400
- Thank you, but...
- Give it time.

09:27.402 --> 09:29.861
Give it time, we just got here.

09:29.863 --> 09:31.239
Always a show.

09:31.241 --> 09:32.490
That's what I like to
see, a little conviction!

09:32.492 --> 09:33.949
Look, if you're
trying to piss me off,

09:33.951 --> 09:35.367
you succeeded.

09:35.369 --> 09:36.660
Congratulations, you did it.
Leave me alone.

09:36.662 --> 09:39.246
Blondie, I was tryin'
to see if you still

09:39.248 --> 09:40.581
got the balls to do what we do.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.082
Trust me, Red.

09:42.084 --> 09:43.083
You don't.

09:43.085 --> 09:44.043
Why is that, altar boy?

09:44.045 --> 09:44.878
Hey, Chase.

09:45.796 --> 09:47.045
Hey, sweetheart, how are you?

09:47.047 --> 09:49.841
Better now that you're here.

09:49.843 --> 09:52.927
Told you.

09:52.929 --> 09:54.930
- Some things never change.
- Never do.

09:59.810 --> 10:02.061
Oh, there it is.

10:02.063 --> 10:03.728
Oh, I told you it wouldn't
take longer than two minutes.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.188
It took them
longer than usual.

10:05.190 --> 10:07.567
- They're maturing.
- They're getting better.

10:07.569 --> 10:09.151
It's on.

10:09.153 --> 10:11.361
Come on, fuckin' jar head.

10:11.363 --> 10:12.989
You need to watch your ass.

10:12.991 --> 10:15.034
I'm a ranger, tough guy.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.452
What are you gonna do?

10:18.747 --> 10:19.953
That's what I'm gonna do!

10:23.667 --> 10:25.083
Get off him!

10:45.732 --> 10:48.941
Dumb son of a bitch!

10:48.943 --> 10:50.358
Shall we get the car?

10:53.989 --> 10:55.532
- Come on! Who's left?
- Oh yeah.

10:57.576 --> 10:58.410
Oh.

11:03.624 --> 11:06.000
Frickin' Newbie.

11:06.002 --> 11:07.959
What's up, Blondie?

11:07.961 --> 11:10.297
- Hey, Skip.
- Hey, boys.

11:13.968 --> 11:16.760
- Hey, Skip.
- Hey, guys.

11:16.762 --> 11:19.805
We thought you were gone
playin' with the twins.

11:21.892 --> 11:23.143
Thanks, Doc.

11:24.395 --> 11:27.020
If you gentlemen are
done playing around,

11:27.022 --> 11:28.481
we got a little work to do.

11:28.483 --> 11:29.816
Pile up.

11:29.818 --> 11:31.317
All right, guys,
you heard Skipper.

11:31.319 --> 11:32.529
Get in here.

11:35.531 --> 11:38.031
All right, Newbie's
first bar fight.

11:38.033 --> 11:39.116
Popped his cherry.

11:39.118 --> 11:39.991
Just gettin' warmed up.

11:39.993 --> 11:41.034
Where we headin' next?

11:41.036 --> 11:41.952
Airport.

11:41.954 --> 11:43.996
Twist him like a jar head.

11:43.998 --> 11:46.207
So long, boys.

12:16.948 --> 12:19.906
And remember to stay clear
of the Danish UN contention.

12:19.908 --> 12:21.992
Always room for
one more, brother.

12:21.994 --> 12:22.828
Yeah.

12:23.747 --> 12:25.039
Part of me misses this.

12:27.208 --> 12:28.499
Roger that.

12:28.501 --> 12:29.334
Roger what?

12:44.892 --> 12:47.434
Boris.

12:47.436 --> 12:48.269
Boris.

12:54.109 --> 12:54.943
Boris.

12:56.362 --> 12:57.197
Boris.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.133
Commander.

13:18.968 --> 13:21.093
He stepped on landmine.

13:21.095 --> 13:24.179
I need help.

13:24.181 --> 13:25.015
Commander.

13:27.017 --> 13:27.851
Commander?

13:32.440 --> 13:34.064
Hello?

13:34.066 --> 13:35.651
Can anybody hear me?

13:37.945 --> 13:56.962
Commander!

14:30.165 --> 14:31.496
Play something a
little more cheerful.

14:31.498 --> 14:32.666
We're not going to die.

14:34.585 --> 14:35.834
So, we back out here to get

14:35.836 --> 14:37.086
the same ole bad guys
as usual or what?

14:37.088 --> 14:39.672
It's what the man said.

14:39.674 --> 14:41.882
So, back home in
time for supper?

14:41.884 --> 14:42.718
Hoorah.

14:44.052 --> 14:45.595
- What?
- Hoorah?

14:45.597 --> 14:48.097
I don't
know about you kids,

14:48.099 --> 14:49.682
but I hope we get to
stick around a little bit.

14:49.684 --> 14:51.141
I wanna play.

14:51.143 --> 14:53.186
Too much violence
in civilian life.

14:53.188 --> 14:54.853
Well, I'm with
Blondie on this one.

14:54.855 --> 14:56.606
I just wanna go home.

14:56.608 --> 14:58.816
Let's get this thing done, yeah?

14:58.818 --> 15:00.108
What, are you
gettin' old, Skip?

15:00.110 --> 15:02.819
Yeah, a drunken,
oversexed lifestyle.

15:02.821 --> 15:03.904
It's rough.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.574
Wakin' up in a puddle of
your own vomit every day

15:07.576 --> 15:08.826
is hell on the feeding, Bill.

15:08.828 --> 15:10.702
Better to burn up,
then fade away, brother.

15:10.704 --> 15:12.789
I was thinkin' maids
in shorter skirts.

15:12.791 --> 15:14.207
Brother, what kinda operation

15:14.209 --> 15:15.332
do you think I'm running here?

15:15.334 --> 15:17.084
My maids don't have skirts.

15:17.086 --> 15:19.044
You guys are foul.

15:19.046 --> 15:20.045
Foul?

15:20.047 --> 15:21.547
Who the fuck says
"foul," Blondie?

15:21.549 --> 15:22.965
Okay, that's repulsive.

15:22.967 --> 15:24.217
Is that better? Is that okay?

15:24.219 --> 15:25.510
Repulsive.

15:25.512 --> 15:27.847
Well, you guys, actually,
you are a little foul.

15:29.265 --> 15:30.597
You got that right.

15:30.599 --> 15:31.598
We have dry feet.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.141
One minute to drop.

15:33.143 --> 15:34.103
Showtime, boys.

15:37.232 --> 15:38.396
Blondie,

15:38.398 --> 15:40.524
sure hope you
brought God with you,

15:40.526 --> 15:41.818
'cause I don't know
if you looked down,

15:41.820 --> 15:43.193
because he sure as
hell ain't here.

15:43.195 --> 15:44.488
There, Chase, there.

15:46.950 --> 15:48.410
You know these
things will kill ya?

15:49.701 --> 15:51.702
What, do you
wanna live forever?

15:51.704 --> 15:53.413
I couldn't stand the company.

16:06.427 --> 16:10.764
Hey, y'all smokin'
back there in my bird?

16:35.290 --> 16:36.997
God damn is it hot.

16:36.999 --> 16:38.207
Gosh darn.

16:38.209 --> 16:40.250
Don't take the
Lord's name in vain.

16:40.252 --> 16:43.920
Well, he did pick the biggest
God damn gun in the arsenal.

16:43.922 --> 16:45.798
It's the best thing
the German's ever made,

16:45.800 --> 16:47.717
granddaddy of 'em all.

16:47.719 --> 16:49.593
You'll be thankin' me later.

16:49.595 --> 16:51.261
What you got, Skip?

16:51.263 --> 16:52.929
Two clicks that
way over that hill.

16:52.931 --> 16:55.725
Seems to be where all the fun
happenin' to be happenin'.

16:55.727 --> 16:57.309
Let's go say hello.

16:57.311 --> 16:59.020
Let's go say hello.

16:59.022 --> 17:00.022
Lead the way, kiddo.

18:12.469 --> 18:14.428
What do you got?

18:14.430 --> 18:15.765
I don't know,

18:17.350 --> 18:20.937
but I feel like
something's watching us.

18:24.774 --> 18:25.608
How long?

18:27.276 --> 18:29.110
Not sure.

18:29.112 --> 18:30.402
About an hour,

18:30.404 --> 18:32.280
hour and a half.

18:32.282 --> 18:33.823
Where?

18:33.825 --> 18:41.621
Up there on the ridge.

18:41.623 --> 18:43.543
Hey, what are they doing?

18:45.879 --> 18:47.964
What do you guys
think, ambush?

18:50.424 --> 18:52.300
Who in the hell's these
guys think they are?

18:52.302 --> 18:54.094
No, no guys.

18:55.388 --> 18:57.015
What's out there ain't no man.

19:04.773 --> 19:05.899
We're all gonna die.

19:20.287 --> 19:21.704
Come on.

19:54.029 --> 19:54.863
Flash!

20:04.873 --> 20:06.373
Get where?

20:06.375 --> 20:07.251
Backtrack, thinking.

20:09.421 --> 20:44.120
Roger that.

20:44.122 --> 20:45.412
Come check this out.

20:45.414 --> 20:48.582
No!

20:48.584 --> 20:49.419
Doc!

20:52.463 --> 20:54.213
Booby trap.

20:54.215 --> 20:55.339
Doc, how's he doin'?

20:55.341 --> 20:56.966
He's messed up, skip.

20:56.968 --> 20:59.177
Patch him up, ready to travel.

20:59.179 --> 21:01.178
What do you got?

21:01.180 --> 21:02.013
It's gonna sound crazy,

21:02.015 --> 21:04.599
but I smell soap.

21:04.601 --> 21:06.184
Soap?

21:06.186 --> 21:07.020
Yeah, soap.

21:08.438 --> 21:09.562
Please, don't
lose it on me here.

21:09.564 --> 21:11.522
Brother, I'm tryin' not to.

21:11.524 --> 21:12.691
This way, 3:00.

21:14.443 --> 21:15.317
Go light.

21:15.319 --> 21:16.611
Thor.

21:16.613 --> 21:17.445
This way, on me.

21:17.447 --> 21:18.363
Blondie, go top side.

21:20.075 --> 21:21.114
You got 'em.

21:23.870 --> 21:25.953
Doc, get him moving.

21:25.955 --> 21:27.791
Come, we gotta get
out of here, man.

22:05.745 --> 22:06.746
Hey, good boy.

22:07.831 --> 22:09.538
What the fuck happened?

22:09.540 --> 22:11.207
There was an IED.

22:11.209 --> 22:12.168
Keep with us, buddy.

22:33.565 --> 22:34.606
Good call.

22:35.566 --> 22:36.815
You think?

22:36.817 --> 22:38.567
Everybody okay? Anybody hit?

22:38.569 --> 22:39.610
I'm good.

22:39.612 --> 22:41.653
I'm good, Red.

23:01.426 --> 23:09.098
Contact!

23:21.613 --> 23:23.113
Son of a bitch!

23:24.532 --> 23:25.366
Fall out.

23:26.742 --> 23:27.949
Right, go left.

23:27.951 --> 23:28.786
Okay, Skip.

23:42.926 --> 23:45.303
You're the one supposed
to patch us up, Doc.

23:57.731 --> 24:00.149
What the fuck is this?

24:00.151 --> 24:01.066
What'd you find?

24:01.068 --> 24:02.861
It doesn't make sense, Skip.

24:03.696 --> 24:04.906
I found tracks.

24:06.324 --> 24:07.698
They were small.

24:07.700 --> 24:10.452
Kinda like a 90
pound little kid.

24:11.996 --> 24:14.580
We saw child
soldiers in Africa.

24:14.582 --> 24:16.373
This isn't it.

24:16.375 --> 24:18.708
These guys are too
clever for that.

24:18.710 --> 24:20.002
I don't want to
think a bunch of kids

24:20.004 --> 24:21.548
are gettin' the
best of us, Skip.

24:34.102 --> 24:35.103
What's up?

24:36.520 --> 24:38.105
I smelled soap
out there again.

24:44.696 --> 24:46.990
All right, I believe you.

24:51.827 --> 24:52.953
You got this?

24:56.123 --> 24:58.040
Yeah, I got it.

24:58.042 --> 24:59.043
All right.

25:48.426 --> 25:50.802
Criminal gangs
aren't this organized.

25:52.221 --> 25:54.930
Really, these
motherfuckers were trained.

25:54.932 --> 25:57.641
This shit just
doesn't make sense.

25:57.643 --> 25:58.478
Not a body,

25:59.853 --> 26:00.688
nothing.

26:03.357 --> 26:06.900
Hey, listen, we ain't ever
lost a man in a mission.

26:06.902 --> 26:10.780
We put everything
we had at 'em.

26:15.828 --> 26:18.246
Hey, Red, can
you look up there?

26:18.248 --> 26:19.080
Lone sentries,

26:19.082 --> 26:19.913
no mercy one,

26:19.915 --> 26:21.373
radio check, over.

26:24.879 --> 26:25.713
Nothing.

26:26.922 --> 26:29.506
These mountains are
blockin' my signal.

26:29.508 --> 26:31.508
We gotta get outta here.

26:31.510 --> 26:33.887
Our guys aren't gonna last much
longer if we don't get help.

26:37.767 --> 26:39.934
All right, tomorrow morning,

26:39.936 --> 26:41.601
you and I go top side.

26:41.603 --> 26:43.228
Call in for a pick up.

26:43.230 --> 26:44.729
You take the wounded
out to the LC,

26:44.731 --> 26:46.774
get them out of here,

26:46.776 --> 26:48.734
and then we get
these motherfuckers.

26:48.736 --> 26:49.571
- Hooah.
- Hooah.

26:52.782 --> 26:54.157
Shit, move it!

27:00.707 --> 27:01.874
Red, top side.

27:05.545 --> 27:07.210
There's a small motor round.

27:07.212 --> 27:08.880
Those fuckers are close.

27:08.882 --> 27:09.755
Chase, Thor,

27:09.757 --> 27:11.882
Get these out of here.

27:11.884 --> 27:13.676
Relocate them to map point 12.

27:13.678 --> 27:14.593
Go.

27:22.437 --> 27:24.896
Come on, Newbie, get up.

27:24.898 --> 27:26.522
Newbie, we're gonna go home.

27:26.524 --> 27:28.524
Let's go, Doc.

27:28.526 --> 27:29.360
Thor.

27:42.915 --> 27:43.956
Come on, Doc.

28:01.976 --> 28:03.226
Stop, Red.

28:03.228 --> 28:05.477
- What?
- Stop. This is not the way.

28:05.479 --> 28:08.397
There's only one set of
tracks, I swear to Christ.

28:08.399 --> 28:10.065
No, this is wrong.

28:10.067 --> 28:11.650
No, we're goin'. Let's go.

28:11.652 --> 28:13.238
This is not right.

28:16.658 --> 28:41.179
Something's wrong here.

29:07.208 --> 29:08.250
What the fuck is this?

29:10.961 --> 29:13.295
All right.

29:13.297 --> 29:14.132
On three.

29:16.092 --> 29:17.175
Yeah.

29:17.177 --> 29:22.015
One.

29:43.702 --> 29:46.871
Shot in the ass,
what the fuck?

29:58.383 --> 30:00.969
Red, you good to go?

30:11.189 --> 30:12.981
Can you guys make it to the LC?

30:15.901 --> 30:16.942
Yeah.

30:16.944 --> 30:19.861
Yeah, we can get there.

30:19.863 --> 30:22.364
I'm gonna kill all of them.

30:22.366 --> 30:23.409
I'm planning on it.

30:33.961 --> 30:36.169
We will come back for him.

30:36.171 --> 30:37.382
You know that.

30:38.716 --> 30:40.510
So, you guys, top side, yeah?

30:42.386 --> 30:43.220
Yeah.

30:51.062 --> 30:52.394
So, what do you think, Skip?

30:52.396 --> 30:55.814
I think this is
somebody who grew up here,

30:55.816 --> 30:57.108
who knows everything we know.

30:57.110 --> 30:58.234
Sure.

30:58.236 --> 30:59.112
Why us, though?

31:00.363 --> 31:02.114
We've come to
kill 'em, didn't we?

31:03.991 --> 31:06.868
You actually sound like
you admire these guys.

31:06.870 --> 31:08.079
We're pretty good at this.

31:09.831 --> 31:12.415
We're really fuckin'
good at this.

31:12.417 --> 31:13.373
Damn right.

31:13.375 --> 31:15.877
Somebody got all of us,

31:15.879 --> 31:17.421
without us even
getting a visual.

31:18.715 --> 31:20.049
I'm dyin' to meet these guys.

31:21.342 --> 31:23.092
Let's kill 'em and stuff 'em.

31:23.094 --> 31:23.928
Hoorah.

31:30.017 --> 31:31.934
- All right, ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:31.936 --> 31:33.727
Oh, God.

31:33.729 --> 31:35.228
I got you.

31:37.525 --> 31:38.774
I got you.

31:38.776 --> 31:39.609
Skip, I didn't
see him. I'm sorry.

31:39.611 --> 31:40.442
That's all right.

31:40.444 --> 31:41.777
Don't you worry.

31:41.779 --> 31:43.447
I'm sorry I didn't see it.

31:44.449 --> 31:45.323
I'll get you out of here.

31:45.325 --> 31:46.657
Fuck, no.

31:46.659 --> 31:47.867
This is the road to the
Valhalla for me, captain.

31:47.869 --> 31:48.950
Only one.

31:48.952 --> 31:49.870
Oh, fuck.

31:51.623 --> 31:54.165
Get these guys, captain.

31:54.167 --> 31:55.624
Fuckin' get 'em.

31:55.626 --> 31:56.833
Last time, we go home.

31:56.835 --> 31:58.127
- No.
- Soldier.

31:58.129 --> 31:59.881
No, saw a lot of
bad shit in my day.

32:03.176 --> 32:04.969
Better to burn out
than fade away, right?

32:06.720 --> 32:07.555
Right?

32:08.890 --> 32:09.724
Look,

32:11.267 --> 32:13.059
take this.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.851
Get out of here, captain.

32:14.853 --> 32:15.688
Fuck.

32:19.859 --> 32:24.823
This was it.

33:52.035 --> 33:52.869
All right.

33:54.370 --> 33:55.997
Now, it's my turn.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.709
Now, I do it my way.

34:59.143 --> 35:00.310
That's the soap.

35:15.243 --> 35:24.167
Who the fuck are you?!

36:39.868 --> 36:44.371
You have got to
be kidding me, lady.

37:09.022 --> 37:14.027
Yeah, go over there, cowboy.

37:44.683 --> 38:06.788
Say goodnight, lady.

38:06.790 --> 38:08.373
So, what is your story, anyway?

38:17.466 --> 38:20.010
Oh, you're gonna tell me why.

39:31.540 --> 39:32.959
What'd you tell them, Alex?

39:35.169 --> 39:37.129
Perhaps this will help.

39:52.728 --> 39:54.645
I'll take her life away.

39:54.647 --> 39:55.687
Mom!

39:59.694 --> 40:02.071
Nice and young still in body.

40:05.700 --> 40:08.283
Look over there.

40:08.285 --> 40:09.576
Look at them.

40:13.707 --> 40:15.958
What the fuck did
you tell them?!

40:15.960 --> 40:17.087
I told them nothing.

40:19.339 --> 40:20.465
Think they're all lying.

40:22.549 --> 40:23.841
Maybe we should just kill them.

40:32.643 --> 40:35.268
Sdanka!

40:35.270 --> 40:36.105
Leave.

40:39.984 --> 40:42.567
Put your gun
down, little girl.

40:42.569 --> 40:46.656
Get the hell away
from my family.

40:46.658 --> 40:48.324
You're a little farm girl.

40:48.326 --> 40:49.160
Put the gun down.

40:50.578 --> 40:51.411
Come to work for us.

40:51.413 --> 40:52.536
Now!

41:09.806 --> 41:12.223
We'll do this your way.

41:50.013 --> 41:51.014
I'm ready.

41:53.098 --> 41:54.640
You shot up my team.

41:54.642 --> 41:55.477
Why?

41:59.480 --> 42:00.314
Why?

42:01.107 --> 42:03.065
Lady, you started this war.

42:03.067 --> 42:04.569
You killed my family.

42:05.652 --> 42:06.569
I didn't kill your family.

42:06.571 --> 42:07.947
We've never been here before.

42:09.866 --> 42:11.826
Okay, then, cowboy. Shoot me.

42:13.870 --> 42:17.830
I don't shoot unarmed women.

42:17.832 --> 42:18.833
Who says I'm unarmed?

42:20.710 --> 42:22.585
You Americans come in
here trying to make peace,

42:22.587 --> 42:24.339
and all you do is
leave death behind.

42:25.881 --> 42:27.839
What the hell's that
have to do with anything?

42:27.841 --> 42:29.674
That's not who we are,

42:29.676 --> 42:31.053
and that's not what we do.

42:32.596 --> 42:35.138
You seem to know how the
world works, my friend.

42:35.140 --> 42:36.308
All right then, cowboy.

42:39.770 --> 42:41.272
Pull the trigger if you can.

42:45.317 --> 42:47.194
They were my friends.

43:01.209 --> 43:02.502
What is wrong with you?

43:04.671 --> 43:06.712
You can't do it, can you?

43:20.310 --> 43:21.143
Stop.

43:21.145 --> 43:22.439
Stop it. Enough.

43:23.355 --> 43:25.647
I'm not here for you.

43:25.649 --> 43:27.525
I'm here for some bad guys.

43:29.654 --> 43:30.738
You are the bad guys.

43:33.658 --> 43:34.491
No.

43:35.451 --> 43:36.285
I'm not.

43:46.462 --> 43:50.007
Listen, I lost my
family, too, okay?

43:54.678 --> 43:55.512
How?

44:02.770 --> 44:04.022
We do stupid things, yeah?

44:07.734 --> 44:10.069
Listen, I'm just a guy
trying to figure this out.

44:11.488 --> 44:12.321
Things happen.

44:15.783 --> 44:18.202
You wanna tell me about this?

44:19.036 --> 44:19.870
No.

44:23.832 --> 44:26.500
You're pretty handy
with that thing.

44:26.502 --> 44:27.377
My dad taught me.

44:28.797 --> 44:29.756
I'm sorry.

44:56.031 --> 44:57.366
Son of a bitch.

46:40.219 --> 46:41.053
Psst.

46:43.388 --> 46:44.807
He's out here.

47:05.285 --> 47:06.120
Stop.

47:12.419 --> 47:13.502
I know you.

47:15.337 --> 47:16.629
Weak little girl.

47:16.631 --> 47:18.630
Too much for the big gun at her.

47:20.801 --> 47:22.261
Let me get a good look at her.

47:30.145 --> 47:36.774
It's the girl
from the village.

47:36.776 --> 47:37.609
Ah, yes.

47:40.571 --> 47:41.987
I do know you.

47:41.989 --> 47:44.156
Thought we killed you.

47:44.158 --> 47:45.533
Well, then,

47:45.535 --> 47:47.993
I guess it doesn't matter what
we do to you now, does it?

47:51.915 --> 47:53.375
You cost me a lot of men

47:54.627 --> 47:56.087
and a lot of money
there, sweetheart.

47:59.339 --> 48:02.466
Gunnar, take her back,
find out what she knows,

48:02.468 --> 48:05.596
and this time,

48:06.848 --> 48:09.223
make sure she's dead
when you're done.

48:09.225 --> 48:11.183
Take her to my office.

48:16.524 --> 48:17.357
Fuck.

49:35.145 --> 49:36.351
Is there anything
I can get you?

49:43.986 --> 49:45.113
My knives would be nice.

49:47.198 --> 49:48.908
Is Katje still alive?

49:53.328 --> 49:55.414
Let's talk about Katje.

49:57.040 --> 50:00.419
How would you like to
be with Katje again?

50:02.964 --> 50:06.214
You and I could let
bygones be bygones.

50:06.216 --> 50:07.341
Work for me,

50:07.343 --> 50:09.217
I can get Katje back for you.

50:09.219 --> 50:11.804
My family is not a bygone.

50:11.806 --> 50:14.184
Don't you mail order bride
me, you son of a bitch.

50:18.980 --> 50:23.524
Three feet above your head
is where your sister hung

50:23.526 --> 50:28.531
and bled until she
was so fucking rotten

50:29.741 --> 50:32.533
that the dogs wouldn't
eat her fucking corpse.

50:47.716 --> 50:48.550
It's me.

50:49.384 --> 50:51.261
Let me have her first.

50:53.306 --> 50:54.888
Maybe you'll do
better than I did.

50:54.890 --> 50:55.892
She's all yours.

50:57.768 --> 50:59.268
At least you get to know

50:59.270 --> 51:02.607
that your sister's still
alive before you die.

51:16.913 --> 51:19.082
Time to get to
know you better.

51:24.587 --> 51:27.966
Oh, little, little girl.

51:29.174 --> 51:33.555
Such a shame that
I must kill you now

51:36.390 --> 51:43.187
before I have a
chance to fuck you.

51:52.448 --> 51:53.364
Little girl.

52:02.750 --> 52:04.917
Why are you helping me?

52:04.919 --> 52:06.546
Let's get this
off of you, okay?

52:14.303 --> 52:17.263
You look like you could
use a little help.

52:17.265 --> 52:19.640
I don't remember
asking for help.

52:35.783 --> 52:39.243
Revenge is not a good thing,

52:39.245 --> 52:41.078
but it may not be
a bad thing either.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.788
Just don't get in my way,

52:42.790 --> 52:44.123
cowboy.

52:44.125 --> 52:45.460
Whatever you say, cupcake.

52:54.468 --> 52:55.302
So,

53:00.433 --> 53:04.435
before my sudden
headache set in,

53:04.437 --> 53:05.770
I believe you were
about to tell me

53:05.772 --> 53:07.607
what was going on around here.

53:12.779 --> 53:15.281
They came with the local
militia after the war.

53:17.575 --> 53:19.701
Lied to some girls,
force others to work.

53:21.663 --> 53:23.995
I heard my father told
some of the UN soldiers

53:23.997 --> 53:26.792
the girls that left
never came back.

53:31.422 --> 53:35.341
Big guy with the
hat caught her,

53:35.343 --> 53:37.844
he was here before?

53:37.846 --> 53:39.554
Yes,

53:39.556 --> 53:40.765
when they killed my family.

53:44.185 --> 53:45.018
Oh.

53:46.353 --> 53:47.437
Now, I would love to share

53:47.439 --> 53:49.399
that information with
the rest of the world.

53:52.777 --> 53:54.821
Roaming charges may
kill me on this.

54:00.285 --> 54:01.658
Hey, Rog.

54:01.660 --> 54:02.576
What's happenin', man?

54:02.578 --> 54:03.493
What the hell's goin' on?

54:03.495 --> 54:05.538
Did you kill them all already?

54:05.540 --> 54:06.998
Yeah.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.415
It's a she.

54:08.417 --> 54:09.833
No, it's a girl, brother.

54:09.835 --> 54:11.544
What?

54:12.504 --> 54:14.379
Wait till I tell
Carter there's a girl

54:14.381 --> 54:15.757
that's been givin'
you a hard time.

54:15.759 --> 54:17.091
Yeah, I'll be sure
to tell him that

54:17.093 --> 54:18.926
just before I put a
bullet in his head.

54:18.928 --> 54:20.219
What?

54:20.221 --> 54:22.554
Brother, he is gone
way up to his knees

54:22.556 --> 54:24.015
in all kind of shit 'round here.

54:24.017 --> 54:25.391
It's them.

54:25.393 --> 54:26.975
I'll call you right back.

54:26.977 --> 54:27.893
Rog.

54:32.524 --> 54:33.815
Bonjour.

54:33.817 --> 54:35.817
Rog, hey man,
you hung up on me.

54:35.819 --> 54:37.904
Oh, man, we're in a gun fight.

54:37.906 --> 54:39.946
Brother, there's
much I don't know.

54:44.495 --> 54:46.495
I need a little help over here.

54:48.792 --> 54:51.417
Okay, all right,
boss, where are you?

54:53.421 --> 54:54.587
Shit.

55:00.011 --> 55:01.176
Shit, I'll follow.

55:01.178 --> 55:02.011
Rog.

55:02.013 --> 55:02.969
Rog, where are you?

55:06.308 --> 55:07.142
Try this.

55:23.660 --> 55:25.909
Look's like you could
use some help up here.

55:25.911 --> 55:26.955
What'd you find?

55:28.580 --> 55:31.165
Traps of the Americans.

55:31.167 --> 55:32.127
One dead body.

55:33.294 --> 55:35.502
Trails of blood headed
through the west,

55:35.504 --> 55:38.130
and two sets of tracks
headed to the village.

55:38.132 --> 55:40.051
God damn, she got 'em all.

55:43.178 --> 55:46.513
And now, she's got help.

55:46.515 --> 55:47.642
We gotta talk to the boss.

55:57.527 --> 55:58.653
What'd you find out?

56:03.241 --> 56:04.699
One dead body,

56:04.701 --> 56:07.493
- blood trails everywhere.
- Shit.

56:07.495 --> 56:08.830
I think she's got help.

56:10.707 --> 56:13.623
All right, here's
what I want you to do.

56:13.625 --> 56:15.250
I want you to go out there,

56:15.252 --> 56:17.670
and I want you to tell
them that we'll pay them

56:17.672 --> 56:18.840
$50,000,

56:20.924 --> 56:22.591
and we'll get 'em a green card

56:22.593 --> 56:24.926
for the person who
kills them both.

56:24.928 --> 56:26.511
You got it?

56:26.513 --> 56:28.054
Green card to the
center of my ass?

56:28.056 --> 56:29.142
To Starbucks.

56:30.100 --> 56:35.772
Everybody loves Starbucks.

56:35.774 --> 56:37.690
Listen up!

56:37.692 --> 56:41.652
$50,000 and a green card

56:41.654 --> 56:43.696
to whoever gets this bitch,

56:43.698 --> 56:44.864
dead or alive!

56:47.118 --> 56:47.951
Go!

57:18.232 --> 57:20.732
So, why are you really here?

57:20.734 --> 57:24.737
I grew up in a small
country in Europe,

57:24.739 --> 57:26.614
you know, the kind of
place where your parents

57:26.616 --> 57:28.574
want you to be a doctor,

57:28.576 --> 57:30.495
but when I moved to America,

57:31.578 --> 57:32.495
I thought the right thing to do

57:32.497 --> 57:34.165
would be to serve my country.

57:39.294 --> 57:40.296
So, you a soldier?

57:42.256 --> 57:43.464
No.

57:43.466 --> 57:44.634
Not anymore.

57:47.971 --> 57:48.847
Mercenary, then?

57:51.348 --> 57:53.766
I don't do this for money.

57:53.768 --> 57:56.020
I don't do this
for just anybody.

57:57.105 --> 57:59.813
I have to be a cause,

57:59.815 --> 58:04.234
or a way to do the right thing.

58:04.236 --> 58:07.571
The right thing?

58:07.573 --> 58:08.614
Do you know what that is?

58:08.616 --> 58:10.576
It's a little bit
like female intuition.

58:11.828 --> 58:12.659
Female intuition?

58:12.661 --> 58:13.830
We have that, too.

58:20.502 --> 58:21.754
Your English is really good.

58:23.464 --> 58:24.298
Better be.

58:25.799 --> 58:26.757
Yeah?

58:26.759 --> 58:28.509
My father saved his whole life

58:28.511 --> 58:32.679
to be able to give me the
possibility of complete freedom,

58:32.681 --> 58:34.973
and he sent me a
school in America

58:34.975 --> 58:37.476
and offered me the world,

58:37.478 --> 58:38.770
and wanted me to see it,

58:38.772 --> 58:42.190
and I chose to come
back once he got sick

58:42.192 --> 58:43.943
and watch my parents grow old.

58:45.694 --> 58:46.988
That's a nice picture.

58:51.868 --> 58:56.203
Hey, so, let me
ask you somethin'.

58:56.205 --> 58:57.539
When all of this is over,

59:29.742 --> 59:30.577
then what?

59:33.829 --> 59:37.874
Only American movies end well.

01:00:51.532 --> 01:00:52.948
Confirm.

01:02:20.287 --> 01:02:24.080
Man, I just don't
understand how our intel

01:02:24.082 --> 01:02:25.041
could have been that wrong.

01:02:25.043 --> 01:02:26.626
Maybe it wasn't.

01:02:26.628 --> 01:02:28.461
I'm not saying that Roger's
been lying to us, Tony,

01:02:28.463 --> 01:02:29.921
but...

01:02:29.923 --> 01:02:32.840
I have never seen that
man crack under pressure.

01:02:32.842 --> 01:02:36.095
He's also never lost an
entire squad to a lone gunman,

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:38.306
let alone a woman.

01:02:40.934 --> 01:02:43.559
For a guy like Roger.

01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:45.894
I don't know, I
just don't buy it.

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:47.521
Something's fishy.

01:02:47.523 --> 01:02:49.398
I'm gonna call a couple
friends of mine in D.C.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.984
and see if I can check
into this Carter guy.

01:02:52.986 --> 01:02:54.153
You know what?

01:02:54.155 --> 01:02:54.986
I'll do it.

01:02:54.988 --> 01:02:57.657
I know some people.

01:02:57.659 --> 01:02:58.700
Thanks.

01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:04.162
Dinner tonight?

01:03:04.164 --> 01:03:05.622
Chow mix's in the kitchen.

01:03:49.251 --> 01:03:52.211
Hey there, cowboy.

01:03:52.213 --> 01:03:53.131
I thought I lost you.

01:04:00.637 --> 01:04:01.722
My name is Roger.

01:04:03.932 --> 01:04:05.726
Hey, cowboy.

01:04:11.441 --> 01:04:12.773
Okay.

01:04:12.775 --> 01:04:16.318
I say when it's time.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.325
Okay.

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:40.550
That's it?

01:04:40.552 --> 01:04:42.345
In the cities, the
girls jump at the chance

01:04:42.347 --> 01:04:43.637
to work in the West,

01:04:43.639 --> 01:04:47.099
but here, it is
now like you said.

01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:50.146
Trust, there are many
rumors, many stories.

01:04:56.528 --> 01:04:59.111
Well the problem with that
bitch isn't helpin' any.

01:04:59.113 --> 01:05:00.403
Double the offer.

01:05:00.405 --> 01:05:01.823
Tell them we might not
be able to protect them

01:05:01.825 --> 01:05:03.533
or their families
for much longer.

01:05:03.535 --> 01:05:07.119
This time we will ask
and even say please.

01:05:07.121 --> 01:05:08.206
Next time we just take.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:54.666
Go.

01:05:54.668 --> 01:05:56.461
What took you so long?

01:05:57.338 --> 01:05:58.211
Three guys and a facial.

01:05:58.213 --> 01:05:59.173
What do you think?

01:06:01.175 --> 01:06:02.800
Smart ass.

01:06:02.802 --> 01:06:06.345
So, can I assume you got
everything under control, Smith,

01:06:06.347 --> 01:06:07.182
finally?

01:06:09.684 --> 01:06:12.100
We should be on a
roll in about an hour.

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:13.269
All right, look,
I will take care

01:06:13.271 --> 01:06:15.979
of all the loose
ends state side.

01:06:15.981 --> 01:06:16.981
Think we can send Gunnar out

01:06:16.983 --> 01:06:17.814
to see if we can
find the bodies?

01:06:17.816 --> 01:06:19.274
No, who gives a shit?

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:20.986
Dead or alive, doesn't matter.

01:06:21.738 --> 01:06:24.448
There are new fields for us to
harvest elsewhere, my friend.

01:06:25.532 --> 01:06:26.617
See you in an hour.

01:06:41.758 --> 01:06:42.842
I got this.

01:07:08.242 --> 01:07:10.242
Are you always such a showoff?

01:07:10.244 --> 01:07:12.702
You always wait an hour
before you take a shot?

01:07:12.704 --> 01:07:34.392
You always wait an hour
before you take a shot?

01:07:34.394 --> 01:07:35.559
So, your name is?

01:07:35.561 --> 01:07:36.395
Maria.

01:07:41.693 --> 01:07:42.649
All right.

01:07:47.782 --> 01:07:48.615
Get out.

01:08:04.965 --> 01:08:05.799
Knock knock.

01:08:12.014 --> 01:08:14.472
Welcome to Eastern Europe.

01:08:16.185 --> 01:08:17.019
Come on.

01:08:17.979 --> 01:08:18.935
Get up.

01:08:24.068 --> 01:08:26.653
Come on.

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.035
Where are you going?

01:08:34.037 --> 01:08:35.410
Come here.

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:37.412
I'm not finished with you yet.

01:08:47.008 --> 01:08:49.091
What the hell are you?

01:08:49.093 --> 01:08:50.261
Fucking Russians.

01:08:52.639 --> 01:09:12.948
I hate this place.

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:13.783
All right.

01:09:23.545 --> 01:09:25.167
Baby, don't be shy.

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.214
Come here.

01:09:31.051 --> 01:09:31.885
Don't.

01:09:57.954 --> 01:09:59.369
Hey!

01:10:16.805 --> 01:10:19.097
What the fuck was that?

01:10:19.099 --> 01:10:20.557
Gunnar, get some guys.

01:10:20.559 --> 01:10:21.851
Let's go.

01:10:21.853 --> 01:10:22.937
Go, go, go.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.085
Come on, cowboy, stop playing.

01:11:05.772 --> 01:11:09.776
You really know how to
get in trouble, don't ya?

01:11:56.656 --> 01:11:57.698
More steel.

01:13:54.773 --> 01:13:56.526
- Layman.
- Yeah.

01:14:06.494 --> 01:14:09.371
Who would've thought one
woman could be such a nuisance?

01:14:46.534 --> 01:14:48.575
This is where you story ends.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:23.403
All right, this is not
how you impress a lady.

01:15:25.865 --> 01:15:28.034
So, you wanna do
this right, man?

01:15:37.418 --> 01:15:38.920
I am tired of this.

01:15:56.478 --> 01:15:59.147
Well, this neighbor
has gone to shit.

01:16:09.951 --> 01:16:12.412
I'm so tired of
you fuckin' Russians.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:16.580
I need this.

01:16:16.582 --> 01:16:17.416
I do.

01:16:22.796 --> 01:16:24.048
You only think you do.

01:16:31.889 --> 01:16:33.765
Do you have a family?

01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:38.351
I asked whether
you have a family.

01:16:38.353 --> 01:16:42.315
An ex-wife and a daughter.

01:16:42.317 --> 01:16:43.526
What do you care?

01:16:44.818 --> 01:16:47.653
If someone told you they
had been killed by someone,

01:16:47.655 --> 01:16:48.490
someone like you,

01:16:49.781 --> 01:16:51.282
would it matter to you?

01:16:51.284 --> 01:16:53.911
I haven't seen
them in 10 years.

01:16:55.914 --> 01:16:56.831
Why should I care?

01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:04.088
Hey, cupcake.

01:17:05.924 --> 01:17:06.966
Finish it, okay?

01:17:09.219 --> 01:17:10.053
It's finished.

01:17:30.072 --> 01:17:30.906
What about him?

01:17:42.626 --> 01:17:43.460
Holy shit.

01:17:48.508 --> 01:17:50.257
Well, now that place
is really a pile.

01:18:16.076 --> 01:18:16.910
Come on.

01:18:36.555 --> 01:18:37.389
I see.

01:18:45.022 --> 01:18:47.273
You drive like
shit, you know that?

01:18:47.275 --> 01:18:48.190
Sue me.

01:18:48.192 --> 01:18:49.275
What are you waiting for?

01:18:49.277 --> 01:18:50.610
The fire to catch up with the,

01:18:50.612 --> 01:18:56.782
exploding things.

01:19:39.285 --> 01:19:40.954
Don't worry about it.

01:19:42.455 --> 01:19:45.373
There's only so many places
a guy like him can hide.

01:19:45.375 --> 01:19:46.958
We'll get him.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.918
So, you still wanna help?

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.505
What kinda guy
do you take me for?

01:19:51.589 --> 01:19:54.172
You want me to answer that?

01:19:54.174 --> 01:19:55.008
No.

01:19:57.637 --> 01:20:01.471
First, I think we should
have a little holiday.

01:20:01.473 --> 01:20:02.306
A holiday?

01:20:02.308 --> 01:20:04.141
Holiday, room service,

01:20:04.143 --> 01:20:07.102
spa, massage.

01:20:07.104 --> 01:20:08.020
Like in the movies.

01:20:08.022 --> 01:20:10.817
Like in the movies, yeah.

01:20:12.527 --> 01:20:15.194
Besides, cupcake,
you need a facial.

01:20:15.196 --> 01:20:17.195
You look like hell.

01:20:17.197 --> 01:20:18.280
Oh, so is that how you get

01:20:18.282 --> 01:20:19.198
the American girls
to sleep with you?

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.577
It works the time.

01:20:21.995 --> 01:20:22.827
It's not gonna work on me.

01:20:22.829 --> 01:20:23.994
I hope you know that.

01:20:23.996 --> 01:20:25.704
It usually works for me.

01:20:25.706 --> 01:20:27.124
Sweaty, dirty, hot.

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:29.083
Sure it will.

01:20:29.085 --> 01:20:30.083
The facial won't work.

01:20:30.085 --> 01:20:31.002
The dirt is fine.

01:20:31.004 --> 01:20:35.422
You could've asked, you know?

01:20:35.424 --> 01:20:37.382
Oh, fine, do it your way.

01:20:37.384 --> 01:20:39.595
Fine, I'll do it my way.

01:20:42.055 --> 01:20:42.973
Don't call me again.

01:20:44.933 --> 01:20:45.767
Don't worry.

01:20:54.443 --> 01:20:56.571
Really, every time?

01:20:58.071 --> 01:20:59.490
Somebody has to help you out.

01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:01.617
Let me get one.

01:21:03.161 --> 01:21:06.995
I wouldn't say I'm
concerned or worried.

01:21:06.997 --> 01:21:08.124
I have my team with me.

01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:11.669
They are the best of the best.

01:21:13.004 --> 01:21:16.338
So, are you gonna buy
me dinner afterwards?

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:18.382
Real men cook.

01:21:18.384 --> 01:21:19.886
You do the dishes.

01:21:21.137 --> 01:21:23.011
I can deal with that.

01:21:23.932 --> 01:21:24.763
You have a dishwasher, right?

01:21:24.765 --> 01:21:25.931
Of course.

01:21:27.768 --> 01:21:29.937
Moving target, 10 points.

01:21:30.897 --> 01:21:32.687
Let me tell you something.

01:21:32.689 --> 01:21:36.652
If I needed to
call the Pentagon,

01:21:38.362 --> 01:21:39.196
I'd do it.

01:21:40.948 --> 01:21:42.325
If I need to call the CIA,

01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:46.204
I do it.

01:21:49.874 --> 01:21:51.459
If I need to call
the White House,

01:21:53.753 --> 01:21:54.836
he takes it.

01:21:57.881 --> 01:22:01.676
Well, of course,

01:22:01.678 --> 01:22:05.971
I figured
they'd come after me.

01:22:05.973 --> 01:22:08.684
I mean, it comes
with the territory.

01:22:15.817 --> 01:22:18.150
What, tomorrow?

01:22:18.152 --> 01:22:20.944
Really?

01:22:20.946 --> 01:22:22.114
We will be ready for them.

01:22:31.249 --> 01:22:32.082
Yeah?

01:22:50.143 --> 01:22:51.853
You are such a showoff.

01:22:53.187 --> 01:22:54.313
This is gonna be fun.

01:22:56.191 --> 01:22:58.067
It was a pleasure doing
business with you.

01:22:59.986 --> 01:23:00.820
Cheers.

01:23:04.115 --> 01:23:06.867
Come on, answer the damn phone.

01:23:13.582 --> 01:23:16.210
Probably laying down,
taking a nap somewhere.

01:23:29.348 --> 01:23:31.726
You have got to be kidding me.

01:23:33.561 --> 01:23:37.232
Just have a great day, prick.

01:24:21.108 --> 01:24:22.861
Why don't you
come to work for us?

01:24:24.112 --> 01:24:25.694
There's something
I need to do first.

01:24:25.696 --> 01:24:26.945
I heard.

01:24:26.947 --> 01:24:28.280
Your sister, right?

01:24:28.282 --> 01:24:31.324
Maybe we can
help you with that.

01:24:31.326 --> 01:24:33.910
That sounds
a little too much

01:24:33.912 --> 01:24:35.037
like free work to me.

01:24:35.039 --> 01:24:36.372
Tony.

01:24:36.374 --> 01:24:37.707
I'm just kiddin'.

01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:40.918
Maybe after, you can
come intern for us.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:42.461
Intern?

01:24:42.463 --> 01:24:44.087
I heard about that
internship thing.

01:24:44.089 --> 01:24:46.465
Is that where I work
and you don't pay?

01:24:46.467 --> 01:24:49.177
Don't you Americans
call that sex?

01:24:49.179 --> 01:24:51.345
You two have fun
with yourselves.

01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:53.181
I got somethin' I gotta go do.

01:24:53.183 --> 01:24:54.599
Come by for a
drink after, okay?

01:24:54.601 --> 01:24:55.432
Will do.

01:24:55.434 --> 01:24:56.268
Be careful.

01:24:59.229 --> 01:25:02.440
You have some good friends.

01:25:02.442 --> 01:25:03.693
He's a good guy.

01:25:05.152 --> 01:25:07.653
Is this where the room
service thing comes in?

01:25:07.655 --> 01:25:10.489
Yeah, this is where the
room service comes in.

01:25:42.314 --> 01:25:43.482
Whoa, Heather.

01:25:44.526 --> 01:25:47.776
Relax, it's just me.

01:25:47.778 --> 01:25:49.531
You nearly scared me to death.

01:25:51.991 --> 01:25:54.324
So much for
romantic surprises.

01:25:54.326 --> 01:25:58.954
Well, a girl can
never be too careful.

01:25:58.956 --> 01:26:01.082
So, what are you
doing here, anyway?

01:26:01.084 --> 01:26:03.292
I thought you and Roger
are flying in tomorrow.

01:26:03.294 --> 01:26:04.128
Yeah,

01:26:07.549 --> 01:26:10.382
last minute change of plans.

01:26:10.384 --> 01:26:12.510
You know Roger.

01:26:12.512 --> 01:26:14.680
So, when are you planning
on moving in on Carter?

01:26:18.893 --> 01:26:20.892
We already did.

01:26:20.894 --> 01:26:22.229
Stupid bastard.

01:26:23.731 --> 01:26:26.481
I bet he never saw it coming.

01:26:26.483 --> 01:26:27.317
Probably not,

01:26:28.862 --> 01:26:34.532
considering we told him
we were coming tomorrow.

01:26:34.534 --> 01:26:35.742
So, you saw me there.

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:42.457
I wasn't sure

01:26:45.753 --> 01:26:46.963
until just now.

01:26:48.173 --> 01:26:49.672
There's a bag
in the other room

01:26:49.674 --> 01:26:51.716
filled with 500,000 good reasons

01:26:51.718 --> 01:26:53.260
to forget this ever happened.

01:26:55.722 --> 01:26:56.639
Are you interested?

01:27:00.393 --> 01:27:04.020
You know me, Heather.

01:27:04.022 --> 01:27:05.398
What do you think?

01:27:07.525 --> 01:27:09.275
Come.

01:27:09.277 --> 01:27:10.111
Join me.
