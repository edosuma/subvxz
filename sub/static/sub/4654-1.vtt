00:34.167 --> 00:36.499
<i>I did everything
that I was supposed to do.</i>

00:36.569 --> 00:40.061
<i>I didn't cry in meetings.
I didn't wear short skirts.</i>

00:40.140 --> 00:43.200
<i>I put up with the weird
upper management guys</i>

00:43.276 --> 00:45.767
<i>that kiss you on the mouth
at Christmas.</i>

00:45.845 --> 00:48.678
<i>Is it fair that to be the
youngest VP in my company,</i>

00:48.748 --> 00:51.979
<i>I will be the oldest mom
at preschool?</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:54.714
<i>Not really,
but that's part of the deal.</i>

00:54.788 --> 00:56.756
<i>I made a choice.</i>

00:56.856 --> 00:59.723
<i>Some women got pregnant.
I got promotions.</i>

01:00.827 --> 01:03.819
And I still aspire
to meet someone

01:03.897 --> 01:06.127
and fall in love
and get married,

01:06.199 --> 01:10.101
but that is
a very high-risk scenario.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.603
And I want a baby now.
I'm 37.

01:17.510 --> 01:21.276
It's too much for a first
date, isn't it? I said too much.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.816
I'm just gonna
go use the...

01:37.831 --> 01:38.957
I'm gonna need
this to go.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.166
Good morning.
Thank you for being here so early.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.468
Hi. How are you?

02:21.541 --> 02:23.133
Let's get started.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.035
That one.

04:02.809 --> 04:03.833
Well...

04:04.544 --> 04:07.274
I just don't like
your uterus.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.336
Don't get me wrong.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.906
Your eggs are in great shape,
but you have a T-shaped uterus.

04:11.985 --> 04:15.250
That combined with your
advanced maternal age,

04:15.321 --> 04:17.084
it's preventing
proper implantation.

04:17.156 --> 04:20.023
Why do I have
this T-shaped uterus?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.993
Well, probably has something
to do with medication

04:22.060 --> 04:24.757
that was given to your mother
when she was pregnant with you.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.264
We used lot of drugs
back in the '70s

04:26.332 --> 04:29.392
which we now know
can cause infertility.

04:29.469 --> 04:30.731
Infertility?

04:30.803 --> 04:35.035
Yeah. I would say that your
chances of conceiving are very low.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.132
How low?

04:36.209 --> 04:38.234
Well, I don't want to
assign a number to it.

04:38.311 --> 04:42.304
What would you assign it?
A color, a nickname, a locker?

04:42.415 --> 04:43.609
Okay.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.708
One in a million.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.514
I just don't like...

04:50.590 --> 04:52.387
Don't say that again.

04:55.595 --> 04:56.562
Come to think of it,

04:56.629 --> 04:59.757
I did take something for liver
spots when I was pregnant with you,

04:59.832 --> 05:03.859
but I really don't see how that could
cause any problems for your uterus.

05:03.936 --> 05:07.838
It was just a different time. They
didn't warn people about side effects.

05:07.907 --> 05:09.340
They warned me.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.604
I think I might even
have signed something.

05:11.678 --> 05:12.702
What?

05:12.779 --> 05:17.614
Kate, I was 30 years old. I was
starting to get liver spots. Liver spots!

05:17.684 --> 05:20.619
I just hope you put
this baby mania to rest.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.017
It's not mania.

05:22.088 --> 05:23.578
How many times
have you tried now?

05:23.656 --> 05:25.681
Three?
- Nine.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.282
The last two
were in vitro.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.725
Have you considered adoption?

05:28.795 --> 05:30.786
I have applied
for an adoption, yes.

05:30.863 --> 05:34.299
Kate, please don't get
a black baby.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.962
Well, I don't think we'll
have to worry about that,

05:37.036 --> 05:38.936
because for a single woman,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.734
it can take about five
years to get an adoption.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.469
I've just had it with all
these movie stars showing off.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.978
"Look at me
and my black baby."

05:47.046 --> 05:49.514
Kill me. I want you to
stab me with something.

05:49.582 --> 05:52.551
You know, Kate,
not everyone is as tolerant

05:52.618 --> 05:55.280
of your alternative lifestyle
as we are.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.547
Being single is not
an alternative lifestyle.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.524
It is when you're 37.

06:03.329 --> 06:04.626
Oh, out like a light.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.221
Have you thought
about using a surrogate?

06:06.299 --> 06:07.891
<i>I saw a thing
about it on Dateline.</i>

06:07.967 --> 06:09.832
No, it's weird.
It's for weirdoes.

06:09.902 --> 06:11.392
I'm just gonna
keep trying by myself.

06:11.471 --> 06:14.929
Kate, building a family is not
like opening one of your stores.

06:15.007 --> 06:18.738
It's not an executive decision.
It's real life. It's messy.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.974
These hormone injections make me want
to punch you in the face right now.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.174
No hitting.

06:23.249 --> 06:24.546
That's right.
- You're right.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.551
There you go.
- Come on.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.348
Well, how much longer are you
gonna put your body through this?

06:29.422 --> 06:31.185
Look, I know for years
I said I didn't want one,

06:31.257 --> 06:33.054
but I just
woke up one day,

06:33.126 --> 06:36.857
and I felt like every baby on
the street was staring at me.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.330
Katie's coming out
of the mommy closet.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.425
Hey, Tyler.

06:43.503 --> 06:46.165
Tyler, what is this
all over you?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.264
Is that chocolate
or poop?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.367
Is that chocolate or poop?

06:53.179 --> 06:54.771
It's chocolate.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.842
What if that
had been poop?

06:57.917 --> 07:00.147
I told you,
messy, but great.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.057
Not bad.

07:16.135 --> 07:18.000
Everybody do a shot
of this pea soup.

07:20.807 --> 07:24.174
Let's go with this.
Call it "Health Monster."

07:25.077 --> 07:27.102
That's great.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.738
It's what I do.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.745
You know,

07:33.186 --> 07:36.314
I was swimming this morning
with the dolphins in Costa Rica,

07:36.389 --> 07:38.380
and I realized something.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.720
I am a great man.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.161
And great men do great things.

07:46.666 --> 07:49.396
I want to open a flagship store
right here in Philadelphia.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.733
I want it to be the
biggest store we ever built,

07:51.804 --> 07:55.001
I want it to be made
of 100% recyclable materials,

07:55.074 --> 07:59.477
and I want it to be so beautiful
that people want to get married in it.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.149
Kate, join me up here.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.952
I'm wearing a dress, Barry.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.785
Won't you?

08:11.858 --> 08:12.950
Sure.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.391
Okay.

08:25.104 --> 08:29.336
Kate, I want you to spearhead
this as our new vice president.

08:30.710 --> 08:34.510
This is me transferring
my success to you.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.378
Thank you, Barry.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.251
Hold on.

08:51.831 --> 08:52.820
Thanks.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.792
Congratulations.
- Yeah.

08:58.137 --> 08:59.798
Thank you.
- Congratulations, Kate.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.542
Hello.
I'm Chaffee Bicknell.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.814
There's just one of you.

09:47.887 --> 09:51.448
I thought Chaffee and Bicknell
were two different people.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.390
Come in.
- Certainly.

10:01.734 --> 10:05.226
I started this business
because I saw a growth market.

10:05.304 --> 10:07.295
We don't do
our own taxes anymore.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.102
We don't program
our computers.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.506
We outsource.

10:10.576 --> 10:13.545
And what is surrogacy
if not outsourcing?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.581
Wait. You're not saying
my baby would be carried

10:15.648 --> 10:19.015
by some poor, underpaid
woman in the third world.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.143
No.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.188
We're also expensive.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.524
Our fee is $100,000.

10:31.397 --> 10:35.128
It costs more to have someone
born than to have someone killed.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.793
It takes longer.

10:36.902 --> 10:40.838
All of our surrogates undergo
extensive background checks.

10:40.906 --> 10:43.670
Criminal records, credit
reports, medical histories

10:43.743 --> 10:45.608
and psychological testing.

10:45.678 --> 10:48.738
But why do these women do it?
Is it just for the money?

10:48.814 --> 10:53.751
You do your job for the money, but I
bet you love it and you're good at it.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.287
Let me ask you a question.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.118
Do you plan on hiring a nanny?

10:58.190 --> 11:00.454
Of course.
I have to go back to work.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.153
How is this any different?

11:02.228 --> 11:06.562
A nanny is someone you trust to take
care of your baby after it's born.

11:06.632 --> 11:11.763
A surrogate mother is someone you trust
to take care of your baby before it's born.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.169
Either way it's your baby.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.404
And here's my baby.

11:18.377 --> 11:21.813
Hello, my sweetheart.
Hello, little one.

11:21.881 --> 11:26.045
Oh, yes.
What a good girl. Yes.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.048
Everyone deserves this.

11:29.121 --> 11:32.454
That's why I wanna remove
the stigma from surrogacy.

11:32.558 --> 11:35.584
There's no wrong way
to make a family.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.424
And you're proof of that.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.088
How do you mean?

11:39.165 --> 11:42.100
Just that you have this
beautiful baby using surrogacy.

11:42.168 --> 11:43.192
Oh, no.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.898
My husband and I conceived
Sabrina the old-fashioned way.

11:46.972 --> 11:48.599
But you're so...
- Old?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.473
You wouldn't think so
if you saw my uterus.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.981
But you know what really made
this little angel possible?

11:56.048 --> 11:57.675
A time machine?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.445
A positive attitude.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.486
You may not have
my fertile body,

12:01.554 --> 12:04.546
but with my help
you can still be a mother.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.855
<i>Make the cracks break
Shake it till they drop</i>

12:07.927 --> 12:10.122
<i>Make the booty go
wah, wah, wah</i>

12:10.229 --> 12:12.595
<i>Make the cracks break
Shake it till they drop</i>

12:12.698 --> 12:14.165
<i>Make the booty go
wah, wah, wah</i>

12:14.233 --> 12:15.291
Nice.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.732
Yo, who you waiting on again?

12:16.802 --> 12:20.966
Her name's Angie. Well, she
might be my surrogate mother.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.133
That's right. You got
your baby mama coming.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.801
You know I got
two baby mamas, right?

12:24.877 --> 12:27.368
No, this is different. You had
relationships with those women.

12:27.446 --> 12:28.879
No, I had no relationships
with those women.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.973
I had relations
with those women.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.382
No. I'm paying her. This
was set up by an agency.

12:34.453 --> 12:37.820
There are contracts involved.
It's strictly business.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.859
You pay the bills, she have the
baby. That's called a baby mama.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.588
You ask any black man
in Philadelphia.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.832
Yo, what if that's
your baby mama?

12:48.901 --> 12:49.925
I don't think that's her.

12:50.002 --> 12:52.300
<i>Here come your baby mama</i>

12:52.371 --> 12:54.430
<i>Riding a Suzuki</i>

12:56.876 --> 12:59.071
I wanna spend
about 15 minutes here,

12:59.145 --> 13:02.512
then I wanna get my picture
taken punching the Rocky statue.

13:02.581 --> 13:03.912
Yeah, well, you're gonna
have to sketch it,

13:03.983 --> 13:05.177
'cause I didn't
bring a camera.

13:05.251 --> 13:08.277
Okay, you did that on purpose,
didn't you? Trying to sabotage my art.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.582
This might be them.
- All right, I'm an artist.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.145
Oscar, this might be them.
- I want it to look artistic.

13:11.223 --> 13:12.747
You told me to tell you when
you were sounding ignorant.

13:12.825 --> 13:13.849
You're sounding ignorant.

13:13.926 --> 13:15.723
Angie?
- What?

13:15.795 --> 13:16.921
I'm Kate.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.361
Hi.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.030
Nice to meet you.
This is Carl, my husband.

13:22.101 --> 13:23.227
Common-law.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.293
He always says that.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.362
Well, please,
come on in.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.440
Thank you.

13:32.411 --> 13:35.380
Listen, shut her down in
drive and slam it into park

13:35.447 --> 13:36.709
or it'll start smoking, okay?

13:36.782 --> 13:38.943
And I'll be back with this.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.293
So, how long have
you two been together?

13:48.360 --> 13:50.624
We met the summer after I
discontinued high school.

13:50.696 --> 13:52.823
And we've been
together ever since.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.490
He never officially
asked me to be his wife,

13:54.567 --> 13:56.159
but he never asked me
to not be his wife either,

13:56.235 --> 13:58.499
so things are going
pretty good.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.703
Wow. The place is amazing.

14:04.877 --> 14:05.901
Let me...

14:05.978 --> 14:07.036
Beautiful.

14:07.112 --> 14:12.049
Kind of looks like Kate
Hudson's New York pied-à-terre.

14:13.085 --> 14:16.179
She read that somewhere. I don't
think she's saying it right.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.314
No, she's saying it right.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.150
Out of all the places
that we've interviewed at,

14:21.227 --> 14:23.024
this is by far
the nicest.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.084
What does
your husband do?

14:24.163 --> 14:26.461
Well, I don't
have a husband.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.729
Got this place all by yourself?
Must have a really fancy job.

14:29.802 --> 14:34.102
Well, I am the vice president of
development for Round Earth Foods.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.869
So you take over
if the president is shot?

14:36.942 --> 14:37.931
Well...

14:40.112 --> 14:42.103
I like your shirt.
- Thanks.

14:42.181 --> 14:45.708
It's a shirt-vest kind of...
I don't know.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.878
I just like making styles and
stuff. It's something I like to do.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.085
What, you don't
get down with rap?

14:52.157 --> 14:56.719
Boy, somewhere in there
I have an old Salt-n-Pepa CD.

14:56.962 --> 14:57.951
Hmm...

14:59.498 --> 15:01.261
What do you do, Carl?

15:01.333 --> 15:04.029
Carl is an
inventor/entrepreneur.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.127
Yeah.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.468
I'm still looking for
that home run, you know.

15:07.573 --> 15:12.374
I mean, when I saw the iPod
the first time, I was like...

15:12.478 --> 15:14.002
I mean, I could've
kicked myself.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.671
That was
so hard on him.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.807
Now we're pretty
tight on cash.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.874
So that led you
to surrogacy?

15:19.952 --> 15:21.214
Hey, I gotta say,

15:21.287 --> 15:24.586
when I first thought about Angie
carrying someone else's baby,

15:24.657 --> 15:26.648
I felt weird about it.

15:26.725 --> 15:28.215
Then I thought,
"Oh, my God,

15:28.294 --> 15:31.286
"if my wife's gotta have sex with
someone else's husband to do this..."

15:31.363 --> 15:32.990
Out of the question.
- "...that's gonna cost extra."

15:33.065 --> 15:34.555
It's out
of the question.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.527
Wow.
This is a nice view.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.604
So, have you
done this before?

15:39.672 --> 15:42.800
No. But I know I'm good
at getting pregnant.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.502
That's not
what I'm asking about.

15:44.576 --> 15:45.941
You know,
we've all had our scares.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.138
No, not really.
- Me neither.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.044
Pardon my asking this,
but how many couples, women,

15:54.119 --> 15:57.714
how many people are you interviewing
before you make your decision?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.852
I guess you're like
our sixth or seventh.

16:02.928 --> 16:04.657
And how's it going?

16:04.730 --> 16:06.561
Good.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.360
You know how in science
they say that

16:08.434 --> 16:12.063
everybody's aura gives off
a different color?

16:12.137 --> 16:14.002
I can read those auras.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.439
I'm very sensitive
to people's energies.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.442
So, I meet new people
and I get exhausted.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.772
Oh, yeah.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.741
What color is my aura?

16:22.815 --> 16:23.975
Let me see.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.718
Sunsetty.
It's like a sunset.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.584
I'm really digging it.
- Good.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.248
Congratulations.
- Good, good.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.347
Really good color.

16:33.425 --> 16:34.585
Well, good.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.288
Because I really hope
that you like me, Angie,

16:37.363 --> 16:41.732
because I'm asking you for
a very big favor, you know.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.634
You have a God-given ability
that I just don't have.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.171
I know I could
be good at this.

16:47.239 --> 16:48.433
I think you could, too.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.236
And, you know,
it's nice to feel...

16:50.309 --> 16:51.867
Needed?
- Yeah. Needed.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.241
Important, useful?

16:53.312 --> 16:54.506
I like all those words.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.344
Yeah, well, I can't do this
without you. I've tried.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.111
I need you, Angie.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.753
I'm gonna make
a decision.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.815
I made my decision.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.450
Decision made.

17:09.528 --> 17:13.294
Kate, I want you to
put your baby inside me.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.732
Angie, I'm gonna
put my baby inside you.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.883
This stuff is good. What's
the street name for this?

18:29.374 --> 18:30.568
So as you can see,

18:30.642 --> 18:34.703
we've transferred three of Kate's
fertilized eggs to your womb, Angie.

18:34.813 --> 18:36.610
<i>Now with the hormones
you've been taking,</i>

18:36.682 --> 18:40.174
<i>the probability
of success is about 60%.</i>

18:40.252 --> 18:43.449
<i>You should continue taking the hormones
and get as much rest as possible.</i>

18:43.522 --> 18:47.185
<i>And in about two weeks, you
can take a home pregnancy test.</i>

18:50.596 --> 18:52.291
I live right here.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.007
Thanks for driving me
all the way home.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.549
Carl couldn't leave the house 'cause
he's trying to win a radio contest.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.414
Well, I would've
offered to do it anyway.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.544
Here, let me give you
some money for gas.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.486
No, no, please.
It's my treat.

19:17.556 --> 19:18.580
Really?

19:18.657 --> 19:20.284
Of course. Angie,
you don't understand.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.589
I want to be there for you
every step of the way.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.225
I hope you don't mind.
I bought you some groceries.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.133
I thought you might want
to start eating organic.

19:31.203 --> 19:34.036
That crap is for rich
people who hate themselves.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.971
Sorry, this place
is such a mess.

19:36.041 --> 19:37.906
I haven't had time
to clean up.

19:37.976 --> 19:41.434
No, it has a nice
old-timey smell.

19:43.582 --> 19:44.674
Is that an alligator?

19:44.750 --> 19:47.685
Hellboy?
No, that's Carl's iguana.

19:47.753 --> 19:51.655
Great. Well, I'm gonna put
this fruit in your refrigerator.

19:55.561 --> 19:56.653
That's the song!

19:57.930 --> 20:01.991
<i>When they play Red Red Wine,
you gotta be the 103.7th caller.</i>

20:02.067 --> 20:03.898
What up, baby lady?
- Hello.

20:03.969 --> 20:05.266
Shut the door, Carl!

20:05.337 --> 20:06.804
How am I gonna talk
through a door?

20:06.905 --> 20:09.169
How can you be
the 103.7th caller?

20:09.241 --> 20:12.108
Angie, I don't have time
to explain arithmetic to you.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.235
That don't
make no sense.

20:13.312 --> 20:15.075
I will see you in two weeks.
Please try to get some...

20:15.147 --> 20:17.081
Would you grab my smokes?

20:17.182 --> 20:19.878
You know you're not supposed to smoke
in front of me. I'm trying to quit.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.216
...rest. Try to get some rest.
Yeah, that's your situation, all right?

20:22.287 --> 20:25.450
I'm in here trying to win us
Arena Football tickets.

20:25.524 --> 20:26.923
Close the door, Carl.

20:27.459 --> 20:28.824
<i>So,
what we're looking for</i>

20:28.894 --> 20:32.887
is at least 15,000 square feet
in the next cool neighborhood.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.523
It can be open lots.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.795
<i>It can be buildings that
we buy and tear down,</i>

20:36.868 --> 20:38.130
<i>although
no historic buildings.</i>

20:38.203 --> 20:40.671
We want to be perceived
as enhancing the neighborhood,

20:40.739 --> 20:42.502
not destroying
its character.

20:42.574 --> 20:48.513
Also, Barry would like to use
mostly found and recycled materials.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.639
<i>So that's gonna affect us,
zoning-wise.</i>

20:51.316 --> 20:53.580
I don't care what we spend,
but we have to get it right.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.772
Shannon! Dante! Anybody?

21:20.712 --> 21:24.239
Sorry about that. Welcome to
Super Fruity. What can I get you?

21:24.316 --> 21:27.342
Does the Orange You
Glad I Didn't Say Banana?

21:27.419 --> 21:29.979
in fact contain banana?

21:30.055 --> 21:32.023
Yeah. Yeah,
but it's a good question.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.321
I think the name's a little more
clever than it is informative.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.089
Well, I will try it.

21:37.195 --> 21:38.184
Okay.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.658
Hey, I'm looking
for a new apartment.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.428
What is your read
on this neighborhood?

21:43.502 --> 21:47.836
The neighborhood's good.
It's good. It's changing a lot.

21:47.906 --> 21:50.033
A lot of condos going up.

21:50.108 --> 21:52.372
The real estate people
are trying to give it one of those

21:53.712 --> 21:55.873
clever names,
they call it WeBeSoCa,

21:55.947 --> 21:59.849
which is Webster, south
of Catherine, I guess.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.449
How's business?

22:05.123 --> 22:06.681
It's a little slow.

22:06.758 --> 22:11.559
But kind of tough, you know,
going up against the man.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.688
The cops?

22:12.764 --> 22:13.788
Jamba Juice.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.093
Jamba Juice is the man?

22:15.167 --> 22:16.191
Yeah.

22:16.268 --> 22:17.428
Corporate juice pimps.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.697
Thought you should know, and you'll
feel free to tell your friends.

22:19.771 --> 22:21.705
Okay. I will tell them.

22:24.476 --> 22:27.240
Okay, now.
You have a super fruity day.

22:32.217 --> 22:33.309
I want you to start
finding out

22:33.385 --> 22:38.448
what's available between the 1500 block
and 1800 block of West Catherine Street.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.189
Ron, I gotta call you back.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.784
Angie?
- Hi, it's Angie.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.092
I know. I know.
So, any news?

22:46.164 --> 22:49.031
Well, I peed on one of those
stick thingies, and it said yes.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.162
Angie, that is just
the greatest news!

22:52.237 --> 22:53.761
That's just
unbelievably great.

22:53.839 --> 22:54.828
Yeah, yeah.

22:55.507 --> 22:56.735
Thank you so much, Angie.

22:56.808 --> 23:00.266
If you need anything, anything
at all, you let me know, okay?

23:00.345 --> 23:01.573
Yeah, okay. I will.

23:03.348 --> 23:04.906
I'm having a baby!

23:33.678 --> 23:34.667
Hello.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.737
What if the baby's
a hermaphrodite?

23:36.815 --> 23:37.804
<i>What?</i>

23:37.883 --> 23:39.475
A chick with a dick.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.883
I heard it happens
to about 2% of babies.

23:41.953 --> 23:43.250
Well, that's crazy.

23:43.321 --> 23:45.789
That would mean that 10 people from
our high school were hermaphrodites.

23:45.857 --> 23:46.949
Mommy. Mommy.
Mommy. Mommy.

23:47.025 --> 23:48.549
No, that sounds
about right, actually.

23:48.627 --> 23:51.323
You can't solve problems
by worrying about them.

23:51.396 --> 23:53.728
Is that Alex? What does
she want for her birthday?

23:53.799 --> 23:57.200
Karaoke Revolution
or a cell phone.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.600
She's four.

23:59.638 --> 24:02.732
Do you think it's too much if I
ask Angie to call me every day?

24:02.808 --> 24:04.673
She just seems so chaotic.

24:04.743 --> 24:05.903
I don't know
if she's eating right.

24:05.977 --> 24:07.239
Is she getting
enough exercise?

24:07.312 --> 24:08.939
Is she moving around too much?

24:09.014 --> 24:10.242
You're only six weeks in.

24:10.315 --> 24:13.045
<i>You can't put her in a cage
and force-feed her.</i>

24:13.118 --> 24:14.278
I know. I know.

24:14.352 --> 24:15.649
Expecting a baby?

24:16.421 --> 24:18.184
Did I tell you? I found a
location for the new store.

24:18.256 --> 24:19.348
Yeah, I have to
pitch it tomorrow.

24:19.424 --> 24:22.985
It's gonna be a girl. That's
what's making your hair so dry.

24:23.094 --> 24:24.493
Cash or credit?

24:24.563 --> 24:25.587
Cash.

24:45.183 --> 24:46.343
Oscar?

24:49.588 --> 24:51.385
You got baby mama drama.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.050
Hey, I left Carl.

24:54.125 --> 24:57.561
I found out he was effing around
on me, so we got into a huge fight.

24:57.629 --> 24:59.290
Things got
really physical.

24:59.364 --> 25:00.456
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

25:00.532 --> 25:02.261
Yeah. I didn't
hit him too hard.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.734
Hey, I brought you
a picture of the baby.

25:04.803 --> 25:07.169
You know,
an ultrasound picture.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.706
Oh, my gosh.

25:11.476 --> 25:13.068
Looks like a squirrel.

25:14.212 --> 25:16.339
A cute, cute squirrel.

25:16.414 --> 25:18.712
Anyway, it's kind of early, so
you can't really see anything,

25:18.783 --> 25:21.616
but they took a picture of it just
to make sure it's growing right.

25:21.686 --> 25:22.948
They said all the parts
are good.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.148
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've been there.

25:25.223 --> 25:27.657
I didn't want
to bother you.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.836
Don't worry. This couch is
more comfortable than it looks.

25:39.905 --> 25:44.205
I also put a stack of clean
towels for you in the bathroom.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.540
Do you need
a toothbrush?

25:46.645 --> 25:49.739
Because I have some extras
that I keep for houseguests.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.852
Good night, squirrel.

26:06.131 --> 26:09.362
What we have here is our Boo
Boo Buster No-Slam Door, okay?

26:09.434 --> 26:10.423
Watch how this works.

26:10.502 --> 26:13.630
You can just slam it.
It bounces right back.

26:13.705 --> 26:15.832
So you can put your fingers right
on in there, and it wouldn't...

26:15.907 --> 26:17.966
Not you, it'll only
work for baby fingers.

26:18.043 --> 26:19.305
Okay.
- Okay?

26:20.612 --> 26:23.080
Also included
in your premium package,

26:23.148 --> 26:25.616
we have
child protection everywhere.

26:26.885 --> 26:30.082
The doors, the door handles,
you have the cabinets,

26:31.189 --> 26:34.215
caps all over the outlets,
cabinets, everything.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.886
It's just baby-proof
all over the place.

26:36.962 --> 26:40.398
Shouldn't be a problem for
anybody over the age of seven.

26:46.037 --> 26:47.299
You sure have
done a great job

26:47.372 --> 26:49.169
getting an early jump
on your baby-proofing.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.434
Well, you guys
are the best in the city,

26:50.508 --> 26:51.998
and I didn't want to risk
being on a waiting list.

26:52.077 --> 26:56.104
True. But you can't be no more
than three, four months pregnant.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.422
There's something
wrong with your toilet.

27:09.894 --> 27:11.759
I'm sorry I broke
one of your rules.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.355
You peed in the sink. Isn't
that against everyone's rules?

27:14.432 --> 27:16.798
Only a crazy person
locks their toilet.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.995
It's for the baby.
It's safe.

27:19.070 --> 27:20.401
Please don't touch
anything else.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.250
I'm here. I'm here. I'm sorry.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.877
45 minutes late.
This isn't like you.

27:35.954 --> 27:38.684
I'm sorry, Barry. I'm just
a little out of whack today.

27:38.757 --> 27:41.225
Want me to get Dr. Gary down here?
Give you a shot of bee pollen?

27:41.292 --> 27:43.351
No, thank you. I'm
good. Let's do this.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.259
Thank you
for waiting, everyone.

27:45.363 --> 27:48.230
This may look like a
dilapidated warehouse...

27:48.967 --> 27:51.595
<i>Lady Luck gets on my side</i>

27:51.670 --> 27:54.264
<i>We're gonna rock
this town alive</i>

27:54.973 --> 27:56.099
<i>I'll let her
rough me up</i>

27:56.207 --> 27:57.196
Thanks, Oscar.

27:57.275 --> 27:58.264
<i>She knocks me out</i>

27:58.343 --> 28:01.835
<i>She walks like she talks
like she talks like she walks</i>

28:01.913 --> 28:03.141
<i>She bangs, she bangs</i>

28:03.214 --> 28:05.341
<i>Hey.
- What are you doing?</i>

28:05.417 --> 28:06.509
What is this mess?

28:06.584 --> 28:07.642
<i>Oh, baby, she moves, she moves</i>

28:07.719 --> 28:09.914
This game is awesome.
Where did you get this?

28:09.988 --> 28:12.047
That's supposed to be
my niece's birthday present.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.147
Sorry.

28:13.224 --> 28:14.782
Angie, what kind of food is
this for a pregnant woman?

28:14.859 --> 28:18.488
Dr. Pepper, Pringles, Tastykakes?

28:20.031 --> 28:21.589
Red Bull?

28:21.666 --> 28:24.134
Angie, Red Bull?

28:24.202 --> 28:27.638
You have to remember that you are
carrying something very precious.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.230
Like a little puppy.
- Yeah.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.500
Yeah. Or a baby.

28:30.575 --> 28:35.205
What you eat, the baby eats. What
you listen to, the baby listens to.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.339
If you listen to DMX,
the baby comes out going...

28:40.919 --> 28:42.181
Are those cigarettes?

28:42.253 --> 28:43.413
What? No. Where?

28:43.488 --> 28:46.116
Do you know how stupid
it is to smoke at all,

28:46.191 --> 28:47.624
let alone when
you are pregnant?

28:47.692 --> 28:49.284
I'm not smoking.
I swear, I'm not...

28:53.331 --> 28:55.424
Why would you
answer my phone?

28:55.500 --> 28:57.092
<i>Hello.
- Kate, we're moving forward.</i>

28:57.168 --> 28:59.693
I think that that
is a great decision, Barry.

28:59.771 --> 29:03.969
Yes, let's get those facts and
figures, Barry, into the idea machine.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.100
<i>We should close
in a couple of weeks.</i>

29:05.176 --> 29:07.144
<i>I want you to put together
a press conference.</i>

29:07.245 --> 29:09.975
How about we start with a
little community outreach

29:10.048 --> 29:11.811
and get the people in the
neighborhood on our side,

29:11.883 --> 29:13.783
and then let the press
find us?

29:13.852 --> 29:17.117
That's why I'm a genius
for hiring people like you.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.515
All right, you.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.925
My job gives me access
to the most nutritious,

29:23.995 --> 29:25.189
chemical-free food
in the world.

29:25.263 --> 29:28.562
I don't want my kid born addicted
to high-fructose corn syrup.

29:28.633 --> 29:33.434
There is a thing called being too
healthy. That's what killed Bruce Lee.

29:33.538 --> 29:36.564
<i>Really? Where did you read
that? The Weekly World Dum-Dum?</i>

29:36.641 --> 29:41.271
All right. This is your folic acid
and this is your pre-natal vitamin.

29:41.346 --> 29:42.643
You're serious about this?

29:42.714 --> 29:45.444
I don't want my baby
to have a pinhead.

29:46.017 --> 29:47.348
I can't do it.

29:47.418 --> 29:49.818
I got it. It's going...

29:49.888 --> 29:51.651
I can't swallow it.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.719
What is this?

29:56.795 --> 29:57.819
Water.

29:57.896 --> 29:59.659
It's horrible!

30:02.300 --> 30:04.165
I need a...
- No, I can't put it in your butt.

30:04.235 --> 30:06.533
Angie, cats can do this.
Come on.

30:06.604 --> 30:08.401
It's in there.
- Just try.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.770
Just relax.

30:09.841 --> 30:12.537
Close your eyes,
open your mouth,

30:13.578 --> 30:15.978
and do it! Swallow it.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.173
Take it. There you go! You did it.

30:20.752 --> 30:22.686
<i>Hey, I'm just
like a lot of you.</i>

30:22.754 --> 30:27.487
<i>I grew up at 52nd and Walnut.
I attended West Philly High.</i>

30:27.559 --> 30:31.222
<i>I smoked a joint with Hall & Oates
during the bicentennial, all of that.</i>

30:31.296 --> 30:33.127
<i>But unlike
a lot of you,</i>

30:33.198 --> 30:35.792
<i>I have since
traveled the world.</i>

30:35.867 --> 30:39.394
<i>I've had papaya on the
beach at Virgin Gorda.</i>

30:39.470 --> 30:43.463
<i>I've toasted pine nuts at the
mouth of an active volcano.</i>

30:43.575 --> 30:47.602
<i>I sat down with Native Americans
and had some amazing salmon.</i>

30:48.847 --> 30:51.338
<i>And I'm here to share
my experiences with you.</i>

30:51.416 --> 30:53.941
<i>You know, I was talking to Jimmy
Buffett this morning about trans fats...</i>

30:54.018 --> 30:55.883
Barry, the time.

30:56.988 --> 30:58.615
<i>Well, I'm sorry
I can't stay longer,</i>

30:58.690 --> 31:00.885
<i>but I have to swing by
my son's graduation.</i>

31:00.959 --> 31:02.187
<i>So I will turn you over</i>

31:02.260 --> 31:05.855
<i>to our vice president of
development, Ms. Kate Holbrook.</i>

31:10.168 --> 31:11.157
<i>Good morning and thank you...</i>

31:11.236 --> 31:12.464
Will there be pedestrian
access during construction?

31:12.537 --> 31:14.368
How can you charge
$4 for one mango?

31:14.439 --> 31:15.838
What's your
carbon footprint?

31:15.907 --> 31:18.808
<i>Okay, how about we line up down
front here at the microphone?</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:20.606
<i>And I can take
your questions...</i>

31:20.712 --> 31:23.613
<i>And I can take your
questions one at a time.</i>

31:24.782 --> 31:25.874
<i>Hi.</i>

31:26.684 --> 31:30.848
<i>Rob Ackerman, WeBeSoCa Small
Business Owners' Association,</i>

31:30.922 --> 31:34.358
<i>and I also own
Super Fruity Smoothies.</i>

31:34.425 --> 31:36.120
<i>It's like Jamba Juice.</i>

31:36.194 --> 31:39.254
<i>No, it's not. It's not
like Jamba Juice at all.</i>

31:40.732 --> 31:42.097
<i>I think you've been
to my store.</i>

31:42.166 --> 31:43.929
<i>Yes, I have. I remember.</i>

31:44.002 --> 31:46.562
<i>Did you ever find that
apartment you were looking for?</i>

31:47.705 --> 31:49.195
<i>Not yet. No.</i>

31:49.274 --> 31:51.868
<i>Here's my question. Exactly
what portion of your profits</i>

31:51.943 --> 31:53.103
<i>are gonna go
towards rebuilding</i>

31:53.177 --> 31:55.975
<i>and the revitalization
of our community?</i>

31:56.047 --> 31:57.275
Yes!

31:59.751 --> 32:02.015
<i>Thank you for that question.</i>

32:06.824 --> 32:09.554
Those are free, by the way.
You don't have to sneak them.

32:09.627 --> 32:12.460
All of this stuff
is our gift to you.

32:12.530 --> 32:13.758
Hey, Kate.

32:13.831 --> 32:15.458
Hi.

32:15.533 --> 32:16.693
What a spread.

32:16.768 --> 32:17.792
Thanks.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.427
So, I had one last
question for you.

32:19.504 --> 32:20.732
Okay.

32:20.805 --> 32:23.501
You never told me how
you liked the smoothie.

32:23.574 --> 32:26.509
Well, a little too much
banana for me.

32:26.577 --> 32:27.874
Wow.

32:28.846 --> 32:29.835
You know,
Mr. Ackerman...

32:29.914 --> 32:30.972
No, no, no.

32:31.049 --> 32:33.279
Mr. Ackerman's my dog.
You gotta call me Rob.

32:33.351 --> 32:36.013
Okay, Rob. I really
don't want any tension

32:36.087 --> 32:37.816
with the Small Business
Owners' Association.

32:37.889 --> 32:40.084
So I would be happy to sit
down with you some time and...

32:40.158 --> 32:41.523
You asking me
out on a date?

32:41.592 --> 32:42.616
No.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.094
You sure? 'Cause you
lied to me once already.

32:45.163 --> 32:47.996
Yes, I'm sure.

32:48.066 --> 32:49.897
See you around.

32:50.835 --> 32:54.931
And then he asked me if I was asking
him out, and I was like, "What?"

32:55.006 --> 32:56.166
<i>Is he cute?</i>

32:56.240 --> 32:57.605
Yes, but you're
missing the point.

32:59.410 --> 33:01.742
Hold on, Caroline.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.837
Angie?

33:02.914 --> 33:05.041
<i>I'm starving!</i>

33:05.116 --> 33:06.140
Well, look in
the refrigerator,

33:06.217 --> 33:09.414
there's a big container of
Monster Health Pea Soup.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.547
This looks really weird and
healthy. I don't like it.

33:12.623 --> 33:13.954
It's good for you.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.083
I'm not trying
to be dramatic,

33:15.159 --> 33:17.787
but I would rather be shot in the
face than eat this stupid food.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.760
Angie, just eat it, okay? Bye.

33:20.832 --> 33:25.292
Caroline? She's crazy. It
is like living with a child.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.367
Well, you know,
you will literally be

33:27.438 --> 33:28.928
living with a child soon.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.702
Maybe you need
to just get used to it.

33:30.775 --> 33:32.140
Alex! Alex!

33:32.276 --> 33:35.439
Wait. I'm an adult. She's an
adult. We will work this out.

33:37.815 --> 33:41.649
You know, studies show that babies can
learn a second language in the womb.

33:41.719 --> 33:44.381
You know, you should play an English
tape, so it can come out talking,

33:44.455 --> 33:46.821
and it can be in commercials,
and you'll make a lot of money.

33:46.891 --> 33:50.725
<i>Next.
The elephant has big ears.</i>

33:53.097 --> 33:56.624
Your CD's skipping.
I'm gonna watch TV instead.

34:00.571 --> 34:03.404
<i>Oh, man. This show's awesome. In this
next clip is a dad playing baseball</i>

34:03.474 --> 34:04.463
<i>with his son.</i>

34:05.109 --> 34:06.508
That kid's gonna
hit his dad in the nuts.

34:06.577 --> 34:07.874
<i>Beautiful day! What
could possibly go wrong?</i>

34:07.945 --> 34:10.139
Hey, have you seen
this one before?

34:10.214 --> 34:13.012
You have a kid with a Wiffleball
bat and a dad with a crotch.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.210
<i>Proudest moment in any
father-son relationship.</i>

34:15.286 --> 34:18.619
You know, it's not gonna be
funny if you ruin the ending!

34:18.688 --> 34:21.089
<i>Here comes the pitch!</i>

34:22.827 --> 34:26.024
It is!
It's still funny!

34:28.699 --> 34:29.996
Oh, man.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.299
Did you just stick your
gum under my coffee table?

34:33.371 --> 34:35.202
I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

34:35.273 --> 34:36.797
Do you think you're
at an Arby's right now?

34:36.873 --> 34:38.670
You know what? I wish
I was at an Arby's.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.712
'Cause there's better food
and cooler people there.

34:43.014 --> 34:45.039
Did you stick all
this gum under here?

34:45.116 --> 34:46.844
I don't know!

34:46.918 --> 34:48.748
Maybe you stuck
some of it under there.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.687
Yeah, actually
you might be right,

34:51.755 --> 34:53.621
because sometimes when
I work a really long day,

34:53.690 --> 34:56.784
I like to come home and chew
a huge wad of Bubblicious gum

34:56.860 --> 34:59.386
and stick it under my
reclaimed BarnWood coffee table!

34:59.464 --> 35:01.022
Bitch,
I don't know your life!

35:01.199 --> 35:03.861
All right, ladies,
there's no need to yell.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.768
Well, the mystery remains as
to who put the gum under there.

35:06.838 --> 35:07.896
No, it doesn't.

35:07.972 --> 35:11.066
Kate, you're used to
being the boss,

35:11.142 --> 35:15.511
and, Angie, being pregnant makes
you feel vulnerable and sensitive.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.378
I know my hormones are on
a rollercoaster right now.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.076
Are you saying...

35:20.151 --> 35:23.143
That's right.
I'm expecting again.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.050
Expecting what,
a social security check?

35:27.125 --> 35:28.956
It's weird, isn't it?
- Yeah.

35:29.026 --> 35:30.926
These conflicts are normal.

35:30.995 --> 35:36.956
This is a highly unusual relationship,
and that's what this support group is for.

35:37.034 --> 35:38.763
Jonathan would
like to share again.

35:38.836 --> 35:40.599
I mean, I'm only saying
because this reminded me

35:40.671 --> 35:44.437
of something I was
journaling, just the other day.

35:44.509 --> 35:47.603
I feel really bad because
Karen and I are fighting a lot,

35:47.678 --> 35:51.774
because I think she's
becoming morbidly obese.

35:51.849 --> 35:54.909
And I keep reminding him
that she is pregnant.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.251
And then I realized
that I am...

36:01.259 --> 36:04.820
I'm... No.
I am... Okay.

36:04.896 --> 36:09.356
I'm anorexic, and it's really
hard, because she's so fat.

36:09.433 --> 36:12.459
And I... I love
Christopher so much,

36:12.537 --> 36:15.734
and he's fat, and I'm afraid
the baby's gonna be fat.

36:15.806 --> 36:19.139
And it's just me
and two fatties.

36:19.210 --> 36:22.611
I'm proud of you, Jonathan.
Thank you for sharing that.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.113
Yeah, that's a...

36:24.182 --> 36:25.649
Thank you.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.886
Anyone else?

36:28.953 --> 36:31.080
I can go.
- Dave?

36:31.155 --> 36:35.956
The wife and I are Methodists.
Ashley here is a Wiccan.

36:36.894 --> 36:41.922
It's kind of like a witch.
They have stores, I think.

36:41.999 --> 36:48.097
But, you know, at first, I was a little
worried about a witch carrying my child,

36:48.172 --> 36:52.370
but I came around to the
idea, or she put a spell on me.

36:54.178 --> 36:56.271
Did you do that, Ashley?

36:58.216 --> 36:59.205
I'm sorry.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.217
I'd like to share something.
- Please.

37:01.285 --> 37:03.253
Okay, I don't know,
like, all the therapy terms...

37:03.321 --> 37:05.789
Well, I don't know the therapy
terms, either. I don't go to therapy.

37:05.856 --> 37:08.950
Yeah, but I'd just like to say that
Kate is always up in my business.

37:09.026 --> 37:11.756
Well, when someone falls asleep
with a curling iron in their hair,

37:11.829 --> 37:15.162
it becomes necessary to insert
yourself in their business.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.996
That happened two times!

37:17.068 --> 37:21.232
Angie, bottom line,
you're carrying Kate's baby,

37:21.305 --> 37:24.138
and you do
wanna get paid, right?

37:24.208 --> 37:25.402
Yeah.

37:25.476 --> 37:28.445
That means that Kate
does deserve some input.

37:28.512 --> 37:32.243
But, Kate, you must remember that
a surrogate is not your employee,

37:32.316 --> 37:33.408
but your partner.

37:33.484 --> 37:37.079
Yeah, Kate, we're partners,
like Tom and Jerry.

37:37.154 --> 37:38.587
Tom and Jerry
hate each other.

37:38.656 --> 37:40.749
What? They love each other!
What show are you watching?

37:40.825 --> 37:41.883
They're a cat and a mouse.

37:41.959 --> 37:43.256
They have
so much fun together!

37:43.327 --> 37:44.726
Children in Japan
can understand that.

37:44.795 --> 37:46.057
You are dead wrong.

37:46.130 --> 37:49.566
I want you two to
spend more time together.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.635
That's impossible. We're always together.
- I don't... Yeah.

37:52.703 --> 37:54.830
Let Angie help you
get ready for the baby.

37:54.905 --> 37:57.305
Decorate the nursery
together, pick out a crib.

37:57.375 --> 38:00.469
Do all the things you would
do if you were pregnant,

38:00.544 --> 38:02.273
just do them with Angie.

38:03.981 --> 38:06.711
Wake up, partner.
It's time for birthing class.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.308
Yay.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.678
Welcome to
The Birthing Center.

38:10.755 --> 38:11.881
In this birthing class,

38:11.956 --> 38:14.720
we are going to help
you new mommies and daddies,

38:14.792 --> 38:17.955
and our mommies and mommies,
lesbian lovers...

38:18.029 --> 38:19.053
No.
- No.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.258
...prepare for
that marathon of labor.

38:22.333 --> 38:23.766
Quick question
before we start.

38:23.834 --> 38:28.032
How many of you are planning
on doing natural childbirth?

38:28.105 --> 38:31.541
That's a good show of hands. That's
so great, you're all so great.

38:31.609 --> 38:37.241
And how many of you are planning
on using toxic Western medications

38:37.315 --> 38:40.512
to drug your baby for your
own selfish comfort? Anyone?

38:47.825 --> 38:51.886
Now this, this is
the Lexus of strollers.

38:51.962 --> 38:54.829
Got an iPod adapter, leather
trim. Check that out, feel that.

38:54.899 --> 38:56.833
Back of your hand,
back of your hand.

38:56.901 --> 38:59.927
Now, what's the first word you
think of when you think of stroller?

39:00.004 --> 39:01.301
Baby.

39:01.372 --> 39:03.033
Okay, what's the second
word you think of?

39:03.107 --> 39:05.075
Infant.
- No.

39:05.142 --> 39:08.771
It's "top of the line safety
features." Check this out.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.005
I'll take it.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.575
<i>I'm never gonna dance again</i>

39:15.653 --> 39:19.089
<i>Guilty feet
have got no rhythm</i>

39:19.156 --> 39:21.647
<i>Though it's easy to pretend</i>

39:21.726 --> 39:24.923
<i>I know you're not a fool</i>

39:24.995 --> 39:26.394
What is the point
of that game?

39:26.464 --> 39:29.865
It gives you points depending
on how good you sing.

39:29.934 --> 39:30.923
I'm the highest scorer.

39:31.001 --> 39:33.492
You're the only one
that's ever played it.

39:33.571 --> 39:35.129
What is that smell?

39:35.206 --> 39:36.571
I'm dying my roots.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.574
I was just trying
to get some highlights.

39:38.642 --> 39:40.041
So many chemicals!

39:40.111 --> 39:42.045
You're a brunette,
you don't understand!

39:42.113 --> 39:43.478
You're a brunette!

39:43.547 --> 39:45.640
I was blond
when I was a kid!

39:47.585 --> 39:50.850
I'm clean.
I'm clean!

39:59.530 --> 40:00.656
Hi.

40:02.233 --> 40:05.202
I'm sorry, I think I may
have overreacted back there.

40:05.269 --> 40:06.702
You think?

40:07.371 --> 40:11.000
It's just this whole thing
is very important to me.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.633
And frankly, it makes
me a little bit crazy

40:12.710 --> 40:14.678
that you get to feel it
and experience it,

40:14.745 --> 40:16.576
while I just watch.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.278
And I might be
a little bit jealous.

40:24.355 --> 40:27.654
Jealous? How could
you be jealous of me?

40:29.460 --> 40:31.792
I'm sorry
I called you stupid.

40:34.632 --> 40:36.793
I'm sorry I farted
into your purse.

40:36.867 --> 40:38.232
What?

40:44.775 --> 40:48.871
I found this shell while running
barefoot through the Toronto airport.

40:50.381 --> 40:53.782
I want you to make our
flagship store like this shell.

40:57.354 --> 41:00.118
You want it
to look like the shell?

41:00.858 --> 41:02.826
You know, Rick, when you talk
to me in that tone of voice,

41:02.893 --> 41:04.724
I get incredibly angry.

41:04.795 --> 41:05.819
I couldn't have
been more specific...

41:05.896 --> 41:07.659
You want it to have
the essence of the shell.

41:07.731 --> 41:12.725
Yes, that's it, exactly. Thank you,
Kate. I'm sorry I flipped, Rick.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.271
Give me the essence
of this shell.

41:18.876 --> 41:20.673
As your pregnancy progresses,

41:20.744 --> 41:23.508
your partner can help you
prep your perineum

41:23.581 --> 41:26.175
for the great stretch
of delivery.

41:27.685 --> 41:31.985
Massage the area
daily with a little EVOO

41:32.056 --> 41:35.719
to help you stretch
and prevent tearing.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.158
What is she talking about?

41:37.228 --> 41:40.755
I think she wants me to
rub olive oil on your taint.

41:42.666 --> 41:45.999
Is it cool if maybe I just spray
a little PAM down in that area,

41:46.070 --> 41:48.732
right before
the baby comes out?

41:48.806 --> 41:51.331
You have to admit
it's a valid suggestion.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.635
So, are you pissed that
no one ever married you?

41:54.712 --> 41:57.738
Well, I almost got married
once to a guy named Scott.

41:57.815 --> 42:00.340
We were together
for six and a half years.

42:00.417 --> 42:02.317
Damn, just shy
of common-law.

42:02.386 --> 42:05.549
Yeah, actually. He was the
only guy I ever lived with.

42:05.623 --> 42:09.423
So now he has three kids,
beautiful kids, with another woman,

42:09.493 --> 42:11.757
an old co-worker
of mine, actually.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.729
That sucks.

42:13.797 --> 42:14.855
You know what?
Don't worry about it,

42:14.932 --> 42:18.026
'cause you're super-successful,
and you have sweet-ass legs.

42:18.102 --> 42:20.297
Thank you, I think.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.271
I had one good boyfriend
before Carl.

42:22.339 --> 42:23.397
Really?

42:23.474 --> 42:24.964
Donny Landis.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.977
We used to work at Blimpie
together when we were 16,

42:28.045 --> 42:30.104
and sit and eat pickles
in the back.

42:30.180 --> 42:33.877
He waited a whole month
before he touched my boobs.

42:33.951 --> 42:35.646
Then he went
to the University of Scranton,

42:35.719 --> 42:38.119
and I never heard
from him again.

42:38.188 --> 42:40.213
He was my Justin Timberlake.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.259
Angie, you can still have
a totally different life.

42:42.326 --> 42:44.260
You're a very
smart person.

42:44.328 --> 42:45.386
Thanks.

42:48.933 --> 42:51.128
I figured out how to beat
you at this game, by the way.

42:51.201 --> 42:52.691
Yeah, that's what it's about.

42:52.770 --> 42:54.829
There's a lot of
techniques that you can use.

42:54.905 --> 42:57.635
<i>I come home
in the morning light</i>

42:57.708 --> 43:02.202
<i>My mother says When you
gonna live your life right?</i>

43:02.279 --> 43:03.610
You gotta hold the
note till the end.

43:03.681 --> 43:06.206
<i>We're not
the fortunate ones</i>

43:06.283 --> 43:09.650
<i>And girls just
want to have fun</i>

43:09.720 --> 43:14.680
<i>Oh, girls just
want to have fun</i>

43:14.758 --> 43:16.783
Come on,
get up here.

43:16.860 --> 43:18.384
<i>Just wanna,
they just wanna</i>

43:18.462 --> 43:20.657
<i>Just wanna,
they just wanna</i>

43:20.731 --> 43:22.323
<i>They just wanna,
they just wanna</i>

43:22.399 --> 43:24.333
<i>They just wanna,
they just wanna</i>

43:24.401 --> 43:26.301
<i>Girls!
- Girls!</i>

43:26.370 --> 43:28.304
<i>Girls just wanna
have fun</i>

43:28.372 --> 43:33.036
<i>Girls just wanna
have fun</i>

43:34.378 --> 43:35.470
I think that was harmony.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.912
That was harmony!

43:38.282 --> 43:41.718
Look at her.
She's got good jugs.

43:41.785 --> 43:43.616
My avatar is dressed
like a whore.

44:05.442 --> 44:07.569
So, what do you
wanna talk about, Carl?

44:07.645 --> 44:11.843
I want you to come
home. Baby, I miss you.

44:11.915 --> 44:13.610
I haven't had sex
in two weeks.

44:13.684 --> 44:15.709
I've been gone a month.

44:15.786 --> 44:16.775
Whatever.

44:16.854 --> 44:18.913
Carl, after spending
time with Kate,

44:18.989 --> 44:21.787
I kind of feel like I can evaluate
the direction my life is going,

44:21.859 --> 44:25.659
and I feel like that direction
does not include you. Carl!

44:25.729 --> 44:28.197
You and your best friend,
Kate? I got bad news.

44:28.265 --> 44:30.358
She's using you
to have a baby.

44:30.434 --> 44:32.402
You think you guys would
be friends in real life?

44:32.469 --> 44:35.927
She's a business lady.
It's just business.

44:37.741 --> 44:39.208
You don't even
know her, Carl.

44:39.276 --> 44:41.642
All right, you got no right
to cut me out of this deal.

44:41.712 --> 44:42.736
Who's the one
who said you should go

44:42.813 --> 44:45.509
into the baby-making business
in the first place? Me.

44:45.582 --> 44:48.676
When the pee-stick said no, who's the one
who figured out how to keep things going?

44:48.752 --> 44:50.219
Me.

44:50.287 --> 44:52.778
You should...
- Here you go.

44:52.856 --> 44:56.189
You shouldn't have forged
that pregnancy test, Carl.

44:57.227 --> 45:00.492
Maybe you should've actually gotten
pregnant like you were supposed to.

45:00.564 --> 45:03.624
You did a dumb thing, moving
in with that lady. Real dumb.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.293
We were supposed to
forge the test,

45:05.369 --> 45:07.132
send her the ultrasound
picture in the mail,

45:07.204 --> 45:09.536
and then cash the
checks. One, two, three.

45:09.606 --> 45:12.006
The ultrasound looked like
a squirrel, by the way.

45:12.076 --> 45:15.102
'Cause it was a squirrel. That's
all I could find on the Internet.

45:15.179 --> 45:18.876
Look, Katie's gonna notice.
You're not getting bigger.

45:18.949 --> 45:20.143
When you go
to the doctor's office,

45:20.217 --> 45:22.617
and you take the test,
she's gonna know.

45:22.686 --> 45:25.985
Sweetie, you're not smart
enough to pull this off.

45:30.194 --> 45:33.630
Excuse me. These are mine, right?

45:33.697 --> 45:35.892
How far along are you?

45:36.734 --> 45:37.792
I'm pretty pregnant.

45:37.868 --> 45:39.460
She's 14 weeks.

45:39.536 --> 45:43.666
Me, too! You're so lucky.
You're not showing at all.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.572
Nice talking to you.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.032
Angie?

46:15.339 --> 46:17.432
I'm going to work.
Feel better, okay?

46:17.508 --> 46:20.136
I'm done. No.
I'm not done!

46:22.146 --> 46:23.238
Morning sickness.

46:23.313 --> 46:24.337
Sounds like she's dying.

46:24.948 --> 46:27.473
Just so pregnant.

46:32.656 --> 46:34.214
Right there.

46:34.291 --> 46:35.315
What?

46:35.392 --> 46:36.984
On your hand.
- Where?

46:37.060 --> 46:38.687
Right... Yup... See. Right.
- Where?

46:38.762 --> 46:42.129
Girl, that's vomit!

46:42.199 --> 46:44.292
Do something about
them vomit chunks, girl!

46:44.368 --> 46:45.835
Okay. God!

47:00.450 --> 47:02.281
I love it, Kate.

47:02.352 --> 47:06.015
I wanna reward you with five
minutes of uninterrupted eye contact.

47:06.089 --> 47:07.078
Yay.

47:30.714 --> 47:33.410
You can stay, Rick,
if you... Okay.

47:47.130 --> 47:51.567
In the last 24 hours, I got clearances
on the titles and the permits,

47:51.635 --> 47:54.934
tax-incentive grants from
the city and the states,

47:55.005 --> 47:58.736
and Barry on the plane
to surf camp.

47:58.809 --> 47:59.833
I'm at the top of my game.

47:59.910 --> 48:01.468
That's great!

48:01.545 --> 48:03.740
Let's do something.
Let's celebrate!

48:03.814 --> 48:07.648
I thought we could order food
and watch this DVD that I got.

48:07.718 --> 48:10.186
It's a British documentary
about a woman

48:10.254 --> 48:14.156
who gives birth to a
15-pound baby, vaginally.

48:14.224 --> 48:17.159
Can't wait to not watch this.
You and I need to go out.

48:17.227 --> 48:19.092
Let's go clubbing.
- Clubbing?

48:19.162 --> 48:22.689
You need to get out of your
comfort zone. Go meet some dudes.

48:22.766 --> 48:25.428
Although, I do have a new ginger body
splash that I've been dying to try.

48:25.502 --> 48:26.662
Wow!
- Yes.

48:26.737 --> 48:28.364
That's really frisky.
Let's do it.

48:28.705 --> 48:30.798
<i>Congratulations!</i>

48:56.633 --> 48:57.622
You're wearing that?

48:57.701 --> 49:00.169
Well, we are going
to a nightclub.

49:12.716 --> 49:15.310
Ain't no good
gonna come of this.

49:23.293 --> 49:24.760
This place is awesome.

49:24.828 --> 49:29.026
I haven't been to a place
like this since ever.

49:29.099 --> 49:34.503
Okay. She'll have a double
margarita, no ice, and two of those.

49:34.571 --> 49:38.439
And I'll have
a bottle of water.

49:40.410 --> 49:42.139
Hey, let's dance!
- Okay!

49:57.461 --> 49:58.485
Stop framing
your face.

49:58.562 --> 49:59.790
Okay.

49:59.863 --> 50:01.228
I think it's good!

50:01.298 --> 50:02.492
It's not.

50:13.543 --> 50:15.374
Here, drink this!

50:18.181 --> 50:20.012
Oh, my God!
That is strong.

50:20.083 --> 50:21.607
Is it?
Try this one.

50:24.554 --> 50:25.578
That is stronger!

50:25.655 --> 50:27.589
I know, I know.
Do this shot.

50:27.657 --> 50:30.251
Why am I doing this?

50:43.640 --> 50:44.664
Are you having fun?

50:44.741 --> 50:45.969
I am!

50:46.043 --> 50:48.068
You know what
I've always wanted to do?

50:48.145 --> 50:50.340
<i>This one is for the ladies!</i>

50:56.386 --> 50:59.321
All right!
Good slow jam!

51:00.090 --> 51:01.580
Old-school!

51:04.694 --> 51:06.127
All right! All right! Hey! Hey!

51:06.196 --> 51:09.222
<i>Listen to it!
It's a really beautiful song!</i>

51:10.600 --> 51:16.835
If I was alone, I mean, not pregnant,
I would be macking on all of this.

51:17.641 --> 51:20.007
There's nobody here
I would ever go out with.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.602
Are you serious?

51:22.679 --> 51:24.579
What about that guy?

51:25.549 --> 51:28.484
He looks like a laundry
bag full of meat.

51:29.453 --> 51:31.978
What about that guy over
there? He's wearing a suit.

51:32.055 --> 51:33.044
It's denim.

51:33.123 --> 51:34.818
You're so picky!

51:34.891 --> 51:39.328
Well, at least he's not a
grade-A dork like that guy.

51:39.396 --> 51:40.954
Oh, my God, Scott!

51:41.031 --> 51:42.089
Who?

51:42.165 --> 51:46.431
That's my ex-boyfriend, Scott, that
I told you about. Why is he here?

51:46.503 --> 51:47.765
You went out
with him?

51:47.838 --> 51:49.066
I did.

51:49.139 --> 51:50.470
Why?

51:50.540 --> 51:52.030
He's beautiful.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.373
Where?
Look at his mustache!

51:54.444 --> 51:56.344
I know!

51:56.413 --> 51:57.437
I'm gonna go say hi.

51:57.514 --> 52:00.278
No, don't,
it's a bad...

52:00.350 --> 52:02.841
Kate, I'm gonna
watch your drink.

52:06.590 --> 52:08.148
Hi, Scott.

52:08.225 --> 52:11.217
Kate, my gosh, you look
great! What are you doing here?

52:11.294 --> 52:13.194
I'm just clubbing.

52:13.263 --> 52:14.787
You remember
my wife, Jean?

52:14.865 --> 52:15.957
Oh, yeah.

52:16.032 --> 52:18.091
Hi, Jean, how are you?

52:19.336 --> 52:20.530
How's everything?

52:20.604 --> 52:23.505
It's great. We just bought
a house in Bucks County.

52:23.573 --> 52:26.474
I'm still doing stuff
for Doctors Without Borders.

52:26.543 --> 52:30.240
Recently, we took in
some Hurricane Katrina dogs.

52:30.313 --> 52:33.976
And I was in a bicycle accident
that made my penis bigger.

52:35.118 --> 52:36.107
How are you?

52:36.186 --> 52:37.983
I'm doing awesome.

52:38.054 --> 52:43.082
I've just been working a lot, and
I cannot have babies, it turns out.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.526
So, good job
picking this one.

52:45.595 --> 52:50.055
What it is, actually, is my uterus
is T-shaped, which is like...

52:50.800 --> 52:53.291
So, but actually,
funny story. See that...

52:53.370 --> 52:55.304
Okay, see that little
blonde woman, over here?

52:55.372 --> 52:57.863
I am paying her to have...
- Hi. Stop talking now.

52:57.941 --> 52:59.499
Bye, Jean.

53:00.877 --> 53:03.004
Why does he
make me so crazy?

53:03.079 --> 53:05.070
Forget about him. He
dumped you. He's an asshole.

53:05.148 --> 53:06.911
No,
he's a good person.

53:06.983 --> 53:09.110
No,
you're a good person.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.746
You don't need another good person
around you. That's your thing.

53:11.821 --> 53:13.254
He's trying to
take that from you!

53:13.323 --> 53:16.224
He wanted to marry me, and
I wanted to focus on work.

53:16.293 --> 53:17.726
Of course you did!

53:17.794 --> 53:21.127
Because working is awesome
and being married sucks!

53:21.198 --> 53:22.859
That's his car.

53:22.933 --> 53:24.423
What, this right here?
- Yes.

53:24.501 --> 53:26.969
Silver Infiniti,
Penn State sticker,

53:27.037 --> 53:28.698
baseball mitt
in the backseat...

53:28.772 --> 53:32.435
This is Scott. You
know what we should do?

53:35.045 --> 53:36.239
Yeah!

53:37.247 --> 53:40.011
I was gonna say
leave a funny note!

53:46.022 --> 53:47.489
Where are we?

53:47.557 --> 53:48.615
WeBeSoCa.

53:48.692 --> 53:51.183
What? You're so wasted.

53:54.431 --> 53:58.231
Stop right here! This is
good. Pull over right here.

53:58.301 --> 54:01.327
Angie, I'm gonna go
get a ginger carrot juice,

54:01.404 --> 54:02.996
and you should go home
and get some rest,

54:03.073 --> 54:06.372
because you look
very sleepy and tired.

54:10.413 --> 54:12.381
Where are you going?

54:14.117 --> 54:15.812
We're closed!

54:15.885 --> 54:19.514
Yeah, well, it looks about
the same as when you're open.

54:22.626 --> 54:26.357
Don't tell me, your people are gonna
start bulldozing the neighborhood tonight.

54:26.429 --> 54:29.694
Yeah, I'm...
I'm really, really sorry

54:29.766 --> 54:32.701
that I'm so good at my job.

54:32.769 --> 54:34.634
What is this,
a taste test?

54:34.704 --> 54:37.639
No, actually, I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

54:37.707 --> 54:40.369
No, that...
That's not...

54:40.443 --> 54:42.138
It's horrible.
- Not very good.

54:42.212 --> 54:45.807
It's a combination
of papaya juice and coffee.

54:45.882 --> 54:48.180
I keep this notepad by my bed
in the middle of the night,

54:48.251 --> 54:50.219
and I write down these
ideas when I'm half asleep,

54:50.287 --> 54:51.777
and they never
make any sense.

54:51.855 --> 54:53.220
I do that, too.

54:53.290 --> 54:56.817
And then I wake up, and I have these
little notes that say things like,

54:56.893 --> 55:01.262
"make everybody be twins"
and "electric toilet."

55:01.331 --> 55:03.390
Those are not
good ideas.

55:03.466 --> 55:04.626
They're really not.

55:05.935 --> 55:11.100
So why are you out so late? Are
you a prostitute at night, or...

55:11.174 --> 55:12.869
No.

55:12.942 --> 55:16.708
I went out tonight for the
first time in a long time,

55:16.780 --> 55:19.544
and I let a friend
of mine dress me.

55:21.318 --> 55:22.979
Well, your friend is
a great American.

55:23.053 --> 55:24.577
Sorry.

55:42.105 --> 55:44.039
You know,
I really like your logo.

55:44.107 --> 55:45.335
Yeah?

55:45.408 --> 55:47.706
Yeah, I did it myself.

55:47.777 --> 55:49.404
I really like it.

55:49.479 --> 55:54.416
You don't think
it looks like a penis?

55:55.785 --> 55:57.616
No, I don't see that.
- No?

55:57.687 --> 55:58.711
No, I don't see that.

55:58.788 --> 56:02.383
Over here
you got two obvious...

56:02.459 --> 56:04.359
I don't know what you're talking about.
- ...stiff ones... No?

56:04.427 --> 56:06.622
No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

56:08.365 --> 56:12.233
You're being nice.
Thank you.

56:12.302 --> 56:14.998
Also, I don't think you wanna
pick a fight with Jamba Juice.

56:15.071 --> 56:16.538
I mean, they're not
exactly Wal-Mart.

56:16.606 --> 56:20.235
Well, they are. They're the
Exxon of frozen juice companies.

56:20.310 --> 56:23.973
Yes, I think I saw a Michael
Moore documentary about that.

56:24.647 --> 56:27.138
That's embarrassing.

56:27.217 --> 56:31.244
So is that offer to get together
some time still on the table?

56:31.321 --> 56:33.949
Are you asking me out?

56:34.023 --> 56:36.184
Yes, I think I am.

56:36.259 --> 56:38.625
Okay, yes,
then, yes. Yeah.

56:38.695 --> 56:39.753
Great.

56:40.430 --> 56:41.761
This came off my head.

56:41.831 --> 56:43.025
Some of that
hair's real, right?

56:43.099 --> 56:45.533
No. I'm bald. I'm...

56:45.602 --> 56:48.435
These are real. So we
got that going for us.

56:53.109 --> 56:54.701
Hi, Carl.

56:54.778 --> 56:56.075
What's up,
hot stuff?

56:56.146 --> 56:58.478
What are you doing here? I
told you to stay away from me.

56:58.548 --> 57:00.482
You think you're getting
this payday without me?

57:00.550 --> 57:03.018
No way.
I want my half, okay?

57:03.086 --> 57:05.748
And I've got insurance,
the actual pee-stick.

57:05.822 --> 57:07.881
I don't even know if that's
real. You probably peed on it.

57:07.957 --> 57:10.187
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.
But I'll tell you this.

57:10.260 --> 57:11.284
It's gonna raise
a lot of questions

57:11.361 --> 57:12.453
when Kate takes
this down to the lab,

57:12.529 --> 57:14.463
<i>and they start doing
DNA tests with CSI stuff,</i>

57:14.531 --> 57:16.362
and molecules and proteins
and the hair follicles,

57:16.433 --> 57:17.764
and they're gonna
connect the dots.

57:17.834 --> 57:19.199
And then you're
gonna be busted.

57:19.269 --> 57:22.238
Carl, I don't wanna do
any of this anymore.

57:23.206 --> 57:25.697
I want a common-law divorce.

57:25.775 --> 57:29.074
You wanna give me back the ring
that I made for you in metal shop?

57:29.145 --> 57:30.806
Yeah, I do.

57:30.880 --> 57:33.075
Okay, you know what? I'll tell
you when this relationship's over,

57:33.149 --> 57:34.844
because there's a lot of girls
there sitting on the bench

57:34.918 --> 57:37.113
that wanna come
into this game, all right?

57:37.187 --> 57:40.884
So I am canceling
this relationship, okay?

57:42.592 --> 57:43.957
Please come back to me, Angie.
- Oh, my God!

57:44.027 --> 57:46.495
Wait, wait! Hold
on, hold on, please!

57:46.563 --> 57:50.556
I wanna say goodbye to you proper,
okay? We owe that to one another.

57:50.633 --> 57:52.567
Can we please have
a quickie in the car?

57:52.635 --> 57:54.000
What?
- What's wrong with you?

57:54.070 --> 57:58.200
You know what? I'm not gonna be
here for you when Kate kicks you out.

57:58.274 --> 58:00.105
So deal with that.

58:01.377 --> 58:03.971
My girl rocks?
My girl does not rock, okay?

58:04.047 --> 58:05.639
My girl is a divorcée.

58:05.715 --> 58:07.239
So I hope
you got Kleenex,

58:07.317 --> 58:11.413
'cause you just said goodbye to the
coolest thing that ever happened to you.

58:14.891 --> 58:18.520
I'm gonna bang your friends.
Consider them all banged.

58:56.866 --> 58:59.858
The reason I called you collect is 'cause
it's gonna take more than a few quarters

58:59.936 --> 59:02.700
to express how I feel
about you, baby.

59:02.772 --> 59:04.797
Hey, where you going?

59:08.111 --> 59:12.480
I knew something was up when I saw
you beating your baby bump like that.

59:13.550 --> 59:16.280
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

59:16.352 --> 59:19.116
Everything just
got way out of hand.

59:24.060 --> 59:26.893
I think
I'm just gonna split.

59:26.963 --> 59:28.362
That's a good idea.

59:28.431 --> 59:29.762
Just slip away
in the dead of night

59:29.832 --> 59:31.356
and leave Kate thinking
you stole the baby.

59:31.434 --> 59:32.924
That would destroy her.

59:33.002 --> 59:35.596
This ain't some little scam where
you just call up Domino's and be like,

59:35.672 --> 59:39.665
"Yo. You know, I'm doing some church
youth event. I need 10 free pizzas."

59:39.742 --> 59:41.107
Why, does that work?

59:41.177 --> 59:44.635
You're lying about the
existence of a human being.

59:44.714 --> 59:48.673
If you don't tell her, you'll
never be able to live with yourself.

59:48.751 --> 59:50.776
Maybe you can tell her
after I'm gone.

59:50.853 --> 59:52.548
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

59:52.622 --> 59:54.988
Not a damn thing, 'cause
you're gonna tell her yourself.

59:59.362 --> 01:00:01.694
I've got
a surprise for you.

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.322
I got a surprise
for you, too.

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:07.392
It is a brochure for the
Philadelphia School of Textiles.

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.199
They've got
a great fashion program.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.364
Thanks.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.500
But that's not the
whole surprise. Open it.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.702
I'm giving you
your check early.

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:20.181
No, Kate. I can't take that. You
gotta put that through the agency.

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:23.343
No, it's not gonna bounce.
Don't you trust me?

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:30.587
Where are we going?

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.025
You have
an ultrasound appointment.

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:35.087
What? No.
Today's Thursday.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.462
Ultrasound isn't Thursday.
Birthing class is Thursday.

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:40.832
Usually, but you're 18 weeks, and
so you have another ultrasound.

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.734
I can't wait.

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:45.706
I hope the baby's in a good position,
so we can see its little profile,

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:49.211
because I'd really like to get one of
those printouts to hang over my desk.

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:50.336
Do you think it could
look like me yet?

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.711
Could the baby look
like you at 18 weeks?

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.512
What if it has
little tiny glasses?

01:00:56.552 --> 01:01:00.386
I'm joking. That's me
trying to make a joke.

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.785
That's cold.
- Sorry about that.

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:04.190
Just...

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:15.093
lf... When you get mad, do
you stay mad for a long time?

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:19.039
Yes, yes. I'm a big
grudge-holder, actually.

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:21.042
Hear that?
- What?

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:23.806
That's your heartbeat.
You nervous?

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.370
Yeah, a little.

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:29.714
Okay, I'm just... Just having
a little trouble finding...

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:31.549
You're gonna have
a lot of trouble.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:34.522
Kate, I gotta tell you
something. I'm not really...

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.319
There's the baby's heartbeat.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.461
I'm not really... What?
- Isn't it wonderful?

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:40.518
Holy shit!

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:42.393
There's a baby in there?
- Yep!

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:44.558
How did it get in there?
- It's a miracle.

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:46.864
What did you
wanna tell me?

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:50.234
I'm so excited.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.332
Yay!

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:58.476
What do you mean, pregnant? I
thought you was lying to Kate.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:03.611
I was. I am. It's not
Kate's baby. It's Carl's.

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:04.675
So the procedure thing...

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.551
Didn't take.

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:08.681
And then I was crying,
so Carl and I did it.

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:10.225
And it's just country.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.555
I missed a couple periods,

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:14.095
and I thought maybe it was my hormones,
you know what I'm talking about?

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:15.289
No, I don't know
nothing about that.

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:17.491
But then I started spotting,
and I thought that was my period,

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:18.864
but usually I don't
have a heavy flow.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.732
Stop it.

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:24.204
My boobs didn't hurt, so I was
like, "It's not my period..."

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.639
You know what? Look, I'm just
gonna lay it out, all right?

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.176
I'm not discussing
the lady business with you.

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.905
I mean, I think it's a
beautiful thing and all that,

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:31.674
but it's disgusting, okay?

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.340
And I'm afraid if we
keep talking about it,

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:36.408
that our cycles
might synchronize...

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:39.319
What am I
supposed to do, Oscar?

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:43.154
I can't cash that check. I
can't take any of Kate's money.

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:46.662
But I am gonna stay here
until I figure out what to do.

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.959
I don't know anything
about being a mother.

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.760
You better start learning.

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.960
It's good if the kid's
raised here, though, you know?

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:56.971
Better school, better
apartment, better situation.

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.401
Is that what you want?

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:04.646
No, I wanna keep it.

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:10.509
Have you read this?

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:15.421
"One in four million babies are
born with a full set of teeth."

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:17.823
Angie, it's gonna be fine.

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:18.883
Where you going?

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.690
I have a date
with that guy, Rob.

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:21.855
Are you gonna
tell him about me?

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:24.058
No. I've made
that mistake before.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.623
It turns out
they don't like it

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:29.865
when you talk about the successful
transfer of embryos on the first date.

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:34.103
Read the chapter about hermaphrodites.
You won't sleep for a week.

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:38.106
Hello, folks, my name
is Chet. I'm your waiter.

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:41.617
Are you folks familiar with
the raw food vegan movement?

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:43.174
Yeah.
- I think he is, more than I am.

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:44.719
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.914
Okay, should we start
with some appetizers?

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:50.516
Yeah. How's the
sea kelp pizza?

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:53.061
That's got a nice earthy taste,
little bit of a dirt taste.

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.892
It's very nice.

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:57.558
Salty. We'll stay
away from that.

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:59.100
You know what looks good
is the blue algae?

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.965
You wanna just...
- Yes, yes.

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:02.059
Excellent.
Be right back.

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.439
So what kind of law
did you practice?

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.604
Corporate. You know
when you're watching the news,

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.274
and you see some bloated
CEO involved in a scandal,

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:14.407
and you kind of
wonder to yourself,

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:17.281
"How is this prick
not going straight to jail?"

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.685
Sometimes it was
because of me.

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:21.689
You must be very proud.

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:23.486
All right, here's
your blue-green algae

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:25.618
and a yeast bowl
for the table.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.719
Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.559
This looks good.

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:30.428
Oh, it's warm.
- Yeah.

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:35.236
What about you?
You like your work?

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:37.238
I do, but I mean,

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:39.740
I have other things
in my life besides my job.

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:42.367
I like to travel for work.

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.046
Oh, that's a...

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:48.013
That's a good yeast.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:50.419
Very yeasty.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.945
How long have
you been vegan?

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:55.287
I'm not.

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:58.486
I'm sorry. I'm not,
I thought that you were,

01:04:58.561 --> 01:04:59.823
and that's why
I took you here.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:03.093
Because of where you work,
I never would have... Oh, God.

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:05.133
Can we... Yeah, you want to...
- I eat meat.

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:06.759
Yeah, I eat meat
like nobody's business.

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:12.199
I'll have a large steak with
provolone, no Cheez Whiz, no onions,

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:14.300
peppers on the side,
don't overcook the meat.

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:16.868
Also, I'd like you
to slice me a new fresh roll,

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.743
because those ones have been
sitting out for a long time.

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:21.078
I want a Birch Beer,
cold, no cup.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:23.948
You really should consider changing
those Styrofoam cups to paper ones,

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.318
because they're very bad
for the environment.

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:28.414
Yeah, I'll have the same.

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:30.689
I'm sorry. I'm a
little overly thorough.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.661
Some people would say that
I am bossy and controlling.

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:35.629
No, that's just prejudice.

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:37.495
They call you bossy and
controlling 'cause you're a woman.

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:42.230
But if you were a man doing the
same stuff, you'd just be a dick.

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.397
What?

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:45.497
Nothing.

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:48.904
No one's ever called me
a dick before on a date.

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:50.969
Term of endearment.

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:55.313
So listen, there's something
that I haven't told you.

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:59.878
And it may be
a deal-breaker.

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.348
Oh, boy, you are super
fruity, aren't you?

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:03.517
No.

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:06.618
But I do
have a daughter.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:11.323
She's 12 years old and she lives
with me every other weekend.

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.133
I think that's great.

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:15.261
Yeah?

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:19.272
Okay.
You have any kids?

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.535
I've never
been married.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.437
Well, Kate,

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:28.517
you don't have to
be married to have a kid.

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:44.088
Do you want to
go back to my...

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.895
Yes.

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:47.196
I was going to say
apartment, just to be clear.

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:49.100
Yeah. I'm 37.
I know how this works.

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.195
Okay.
- Let's go.

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:52.365
It's actually
this way.

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:53.703
Okay.

01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:00.012
1406.
- Yeah.

01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:01.606
Oh, no. No, no, no.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:05.518
Look who just got inducted
into the walk of shame.

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:08.614
Why are you all shiny
like a soul food cook?

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:10.519
I want you, now,

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:13.084
to look your partner in the
eye, and I want you to tell her

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:15.891
she is beautiful.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.965
You are beautiful.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:21.697
Tell her,
"You are strong."

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.098
You are strong.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:28.200
Tell her, "Thank you
for giving me this baby."

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:30.768
Thank you for giving me this baby.

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:35.040
Are you crying?
- No.

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:39.516
I am. I'm crying a little bit.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.648
All right.

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:47.220
Romaine, Cheyenne,
time to go.

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:50.322
We have a playdate
with Wingspan and Banjo.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:54.530
Those kids would have got their asses
handed to them in my neighborhood.

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:57.731
My sister wants to know what kind
of cake you want for the shower.

01:07:57.807 --> 01:07:59.604
Kate, I don't think I
should go to that, you know?

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:01.609
I mean, that's just
kind of for you.

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.042
No, it's for both of us.

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:06.343
My mother wants to meet you
and make you feel weird.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.274
Excuse me.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.213
Yes. Barry, hi.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:14.779
No, I'm pulling into the
construction site right now.

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:16.585
Think I went to
a rave here once.

01:08:16.658 --> 01:08:17.990
Please, I asked you
to wait in the car.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.049
It's too hot in there,

01:08:19.127 --> 01:08:21.220
and your weirdo air conditioning,
I don't know how to work it.

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:22.854
Barry, I'm sorry.
- Kate, where you been?

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.957
I'm having second thoughts
about this location.

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:26.058
Is it the taxes?

01:08:26.135 --> 01:08:28.660
It's probably because this place
gives you a weird vibe, right?

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:30.966
Yes. That one.

01:08:32.073 --> 01:08:34.406
I'm not getting
good vibes here.

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:36.377
And if there's one thing
Oprah taught me,

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:38.777
it's to trust my instincts
and follow my fear.

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.872
Is that the episode where
she got her ears pierced?

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:44.511
No, this was at her home
in Maui. Who are you?

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:45.576
I'm Angie.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:46.779
She works for me.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.915
She's very intuitive.

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:50.287
I read people's energies.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.224
You read energies?
- Yeah.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.130
Good. Very good.

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:02.630
How's the energy
in this site?

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:07.604
Green, mostly.

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:10.910
Like healthy leaves.

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.412
Money?

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:17.183
Exactly.

01:09:17.252 --> 01:09:18.550
I like your maid.

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:19.645
So do I.

01:09:19.721 --> 01:09:21.349
Let me put my hands
into your hands,

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:23.550
and I'll whisper to you
the secret of success.

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:34.600
So, are we back on?

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.365
We were never off.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:37.794
What did he say?

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:38.999
The secret of success.

01:09:39.073 --> 01:09:40.063
And?

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:41.301
He said
"Have a big penis."

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.072
No, he didn't.
- Yeah, he did.

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:46.540
Oh, my God!

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.770
Oh, my God.
Look! Wait.

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:50.641
Is that the face?
- I think.

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:53.079
That was a big one!

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:55.883
Oh, my God.
What does it feel like?

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.644
Like if you ate
a meatball sandwich,

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:01.087
then that meatball
sandwich was kicking you.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.756
I think I gotta tell Rob
about you and the baby.

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:05.851
What? Why?

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.020
Well, we've been
going out for a month,

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.223
and I didn't think
it would turn into anything,

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:10.287
but it sort of is.

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:11.890
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:13.832
You know, he may break up with you.

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:17.063
Yeah, but the longer I wait,
the weirder it's gonna be.

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.800
It's gonna be weird
no matter what.

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:22.002
He'll know I'm hiding
something. I'm the worst liar.

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:25.205
Okay, tell me three things about
yourself and make one of them a lie.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:26.612
Okay.

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:28.980
I'm from Pennsylvania,

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:32.452
I am a Leo,
and I am 5'9".

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.050
I don't want to... This
is why I can't lie to him.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.684
You're not lying to him,

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:41.229
you're just not telling him the
truth, there's a big difference.

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:42.762
Is there?

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.529
I don't know.
Don't ask me.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:56.811
<i>Don't speak
I can't even take it</i>

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:59.939
<i>And I don't
need no reason</i>

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:01.980
Hi.

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:04.884
I'm Rob. I'm here to pick up Kate.

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:05.942
Oh!

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:11.859
Sorry, I'm a little early. I was
just in the neighborhood, so...

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.619
Do come in.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.489
Hello, I'm Angela.

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:19.591
Okay.

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:23.035
I'm Kate's sister, so...

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:26.331
We are in the same family.

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:32.403
And I was just practicing the
ancient Japanese art of karaoke.

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:34.772
Karaoke?
- Yes.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:38.616
You delightful...
Hello. Oh, well.

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:41.987
I can see how she
likes you so much. Kate?

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:43.388
You live here?
- No,

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:44.790
no.

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:49.091
I live in New York City
in a pied-à-terre apartment

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:51.257
with a husband
that I have.

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:56.566
Wow, so you're just
kind of visiting here, or...

01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:58.299
He's in the stock market.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:03.607
So we go from city to city,
visiting other stock markets.

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:05.846
And that's how we roll.

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:07.541
It's funny, 'cause you guys
don't look alike at all.

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:09.048
Oh, well.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.710
Different dads?
- Yes.

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.582
We have different dads.
That's what we have.

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:15.282
We have different dads.
Thank you for that.

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.325
Is that my phone?

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:18.723
I didn't actually hear...

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:22.230
It was. Hold on, it's
from Europe. Hello?

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:32.798
Yes, interesting. It's a business
call. So nice to meet you.

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:34.831
What?
- Yes.

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:38.040
What? How long
did he talk to you?

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:41.640
Hi. Look at you, early bird.

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:43.685
Okay, it's nice to see you.

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:44.980
Oh, my gosh,
well, let's go.

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:46.077
Yeah.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.679
Does your sister
want to come with us?

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.883
No, she's not well.

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:52.250
<i>Bye, Angela.
- Adios.</i>

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:54.991
Push, woman.

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:59.430
Yeah, good. Push, and
boom! Congratulations. Look.

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:01.628
Popcorn.

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:02.761
See?

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:06.137
It's that easy.
What movie we watching?

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.244
<i>Extreme Vaginal Delivery.</i>

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:12.207
The miracle of
really big childbirth.

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:15.907
Oh, damn!

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:17.942
You can't come
back from that.

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:21.920
That's why you always
want to stay over here, huh?

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:23.924
It's one of the reasons.
- Well,

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:26.119
how long is your sister in town?

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.822
Angie's not
really my sister.

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:31.332
I know. She's your
half-sister. She told me.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:35.232
What else did
Angela tell you?

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:37.004
Well,

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:40.300
she told me
that you like me a lot.

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:43.139
Well, she's a liar.
She's a known liar.

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.201
What is this?

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:49.717
Jillian wants me to take her to an exhibit
of abnormal skulls at the Mütter Museum.

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:52.219
Do you need me
to get out of here?

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:54.255
No, no. No, I was gonna
see if you wanted to come.

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:55.620
You want me
to meet your daughter?

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.852
Is that a bad idea?

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.589
No. I really,
really like kids.

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:05.564
Oh, my God.
- I know.

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:07.795
Have you read
this article?

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:10.236
This Chaffee Backnell lady.

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:12.535
Bicknell.
- She is a piece of work.

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:17.238
I mean, her whole surrogacy
process is very science-fictiony.

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:18.973
There's so many kids
that need to be adopted.

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.344
Well, adoption
can take years.

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:24.681
And these people would pay, like,
you know, $50,000, in order to...

01:15:24.753 --> 01:15:26.152
It's $100,000, actually.

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:30.123
You know, have your baby
custom-carried by a gestation assistant.

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.216
What is that?

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:34.023
Well, I think it's probably
more complicated than it seems.

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.927
A lot of rich people
getting what they want.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:40.293
I hate that song.

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:46.407
Here you go. You got it?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:47.464
So, do you feel
good about yourself?

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:50.272
You're just going to let Kate go ahead
and have this whole baby shower, right?

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:52.745
You don't realize
how ruthless that is, right?

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:55.305
Hey, man, that's a sweet cake.
That's tight. That's tight.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.908
Service entrance,
straight to the terrace.

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:57.974
What am I
supposed to do?

01:15:58.053 --> 01:16:00.521
Tell her today, in front of all
of her friends and her family?

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:02.682
No, no, no. Wait till the
child is, like, nine years old,

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:04.453
and then tell her,
like my first ex did me.

01:16:04.526 --> 01:16:07.188
Okay, I'm going to
tell her tonight.

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:09.096
Or Monday.

01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:12.362
But then it'll ruin her week, so
maybe I should wait till Friday.

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:14.492
Then it would ruin her
weekend, so maybe I should...

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.333
I don't know
when I'm gonna tell her.

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:18.530
When's the best day to
tell someone horrible news?

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:19.631
Yesterday.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:25.209
I tell you, a pagan birth
is a fascinating thing.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.713
You know, now that
I've done it myself,

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:29.182
it seems crazy
not to eat the placenta.

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.976
I'm sorry, did you say
polenta or placenta?

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:34.249
Placenta,
the afterbirth, yeah.

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:36.917
Ashley turned us onto it...

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:40.828
Angie.

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.690
Hi, I'm Caroline,

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:45.324
Kate's sister. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.527
And this is
our mother, Rose.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:48.729
Hi, nice to meet you.

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:49.862
How do you do?

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:52.338
So, tell me,
once the baby is born,

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:55.968
will you just go away, or
shall I expect you at Christmas?

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.068
Mom.

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.169
What?

01:16:58.246 --> 01:17:01.807
This is a reasonable question.
All my friends are asking.

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.544
Well, we haven't
really talked about it.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.177
No, there's not a lot of
stuff we've talked about,

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:06.914
we have a lot of stuff
to talk about.

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:09.685
I think Angie might want to
visit the baby a few times a year.

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:12.750
You know, or I might be out of
town, I don't know where I'm going.

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:15.524
I mean, I think I've got
plans, but I'll definitely call.

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:18.327
Summer, if we're on vacation, maybe Angie
would want to come with us some time.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.628
And who knows where we're
going to be in a year?

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:22.101
I think it's really important that
she remain a part of the baby's life.

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:24.832
Yeah, you know,
or completely separate.

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.305
We're just going to
play it fast and loose,

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:29.742
you know, just see
how it all shakes out.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:31.039
Always been my motto.

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:47.223
Rob? Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:49.661
Hey, I know it's your
sister's baby shower,

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.359
just, you haven't called me in days.
I thought maybe I did something wrong.

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:54.197
No, you didn't do anything.

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:55.930
Is it because I wanted to
introduce you to my kid?

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.494
No, Rob, I just...

01:17:57.572 --> 01:17:59.767
I think you and I
view the world differently.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:02.309
Bad news people,
party's over.

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.938
Start heading for the door.
- Who let him in here?

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:06.981
Carl, don't say
something stupid.

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:09.017
She hasn't told you.

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:10.749
I thought since you
guys were best friends,

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:12.081
she probably
told you everything.

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:14.247
Shut your mouth, Carl.
- What is going on?

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:16.552
She's not even pregnant, okay?

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.554
I mean, look.

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:21.056
Angie what is that?

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.229
Feel it.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.961
It's moving.
- Yeah, it's a baby.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.432
And it's yours.

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:30.795
What are you saying?

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:31.896
Kate,

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:34.533
I really tried to make
you a baby, I swear.

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:35.701
What are you saying?

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:36.903
We took a test

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:39.572
as soon as we got home,
and the procedure didn't work.

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:43.117
And I was real, you know, horny,
because of all the hormones.

01:18:43.185 --> 01:18:44.743
So we did it.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:46.247
I felt like a failure.

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:48.050
And Carl told me you were
going to get somebody else.

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:50.819
Those hormones can also
give you a false negative.

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:54.123
That's why they want you to wait
two weeks before you take a test.

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:56.391
Wait, what?
- So she might not be pregnant?

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:58.524
Yo, where you
escape from, man?

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.899
I'm saying the baby might be
Carl's, but it might still be mine.

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.562
Okay, then
forget what I said.

01:19:03.638 --> 01:19:04.662
I'm trying to
play catch-up here.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.004
So you get
your sister pregnant,

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:09.043
but she slept with him?
- No, she's not my sister.

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:13.070
She's an ignorant white trash
woman that I paid to carry my kid.

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:15.543
I deserve that.

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:16.606
No, you don't.

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:17.743
How could you do that?

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:19.252
This is why I didn't
call you back, Rob,

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.983
because this is the kind of
selfish, science fiction shit

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.581
that you don't
want any part of.

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:28.094
Well, the upside is, it
looks like I might be a dad.

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:30.631
So if it's a boy,
I want to marry you.

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:31.723
Oh, my God.

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:34.596
What?

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.833
I'm so sorry
about what's happened.

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:39.533
But I think it's best to wait until
the pregnancy is far enough along

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:42.600
for DNA testing, before
we do anything drastic.

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:45.978
That was quite a kick.

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:47.139
How can you
be pregnant?

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:49.376
Your eggs are
from the '40s.

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.351
You're upset.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.150
And you're saying hurtful
things. It's understandable.

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:57.991
We'll have a DNA
sample sent to the lab.

01:19:58.059 --> 01:20:00.619
The rest will be
handled in family court.

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:05.291
Of course, if the baby turns out not
to be yours, we'll waive our fees.

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.096
What about all
the background checks?

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:11.605
Passed.
With flying colors.

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:14.732
You were living with her, and
you didn't notice anything.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.539
She fooled us, Kate.

01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:18.306
She fooled us all.

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:21.342
I fooled myself.

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:36.191
I booked you a room here,
until we sort this out.

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:39.995
So you're done with me, now, is
that it? You don't need me anymore?

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:43.003
Gonna try to find some
other lowlife you can use

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:44.971
to give you everything
you ever wanted?

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.473
I'm not gonna do this.

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.031
You know, you think
you're better than me...

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:51.374
I am certain that I
am better than you.

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:54.111
Okay, we're being honest now?

01:20:54.182 --> 01:20:56.480
Here's one. I can have
a baby, and you can't.

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:57.609
And that drives you crazy.

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.381
Get out of my car.

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:04.722
Your stupid space car's
locked me in.

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:07.351
Don't touch it
when I'm touching it.

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:09.085
Just open it!

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:10.722
Yeah, you bang on the door,
that's how you open it.

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.562
Well, you can't
even find the stupid...

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:13.658
Raised by wolves!

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:14.793
Tell me
how to open it!

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:17.737
Stop touching it,
and I will open it.

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:20.440
It is open now.

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:21.873
Good.

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:45.257
Look, buddy, you don't have to sell
me on the product, I'm already in.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:46.357
Here's what I'm asking.

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:50.871
Do you have a discount policy if you're
related to one of the girls that's gone wild?

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:36.541
Enjoy it, Kate.
This is your baby.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.512
I'm going to go hide this
shell somewhere in the store.

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:48.461
Hey.

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:53.958
Can I get an Orange You
Glad I Didn't Say Banana?

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:04.236
<i>All right.
Holbrook v. Ostrowiski.</i>

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.336
Present.

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:07.779
I take it this is
a paternity case.

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:10.511
Actually, it's a
maternity case, Your Honor.

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:13.143
Katherine Holbrook hired this
woman to be her surrogate,

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:14.813
now we're not sure
whose egg this is in here.

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.686
What are you doing here?

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:19.249
Angie needed some legal
help, so I'm helping.

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:21.158
And you are?
- I'm Rob Ackerman,

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:23.993
formerly with the firm
Swanson and Weisberg.

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:25.692
Formerly?
- Yeah, now he makes

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:27.257
fruit smoothies.

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:30.166
You mean like Jamba Juice?

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:34.706
Yes, Your Honor, it's
exactly like Jamba Juice.

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:37.108
'Cause I love Jamba Juice.

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:38.776
Yeah.
- Who doesn't?

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.678
You don't need a lawyer,

01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:42.477
you know, we're just
here to read some results.

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:45.542
But I know that I have
the right to a lawyer.

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:46.976
Objection.

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:48.147
And you are?

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:50.020
Carl Loomis,
Your Highness.

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:52.560
I'm here to seek joint
custody of that fetus.

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:54.618
Your Honor, this dummy
used to be my husband.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:57.824
Did you provide a DNA
sample, Mr. Loomis?

01:23:58.099 --> 01:23:59.088
Uh-huh.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.498
What's that now?

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:05.670
Did you give someone a hair
follicle or a vial of your blood?

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:09.041
No. Not as it pertains
to this case.

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:10.702
All right, then you're
going to have to take a seat.

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:12.110
And if you disrupt
the proceedings again,

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.705
I'll ask the bailiff
to escort you out.

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.182
Not scared of her.

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:17.411
May I have
the lab results, please?

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:19.919
Okay, I would like to testify
on behalf of the prosecution.

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.819
There is no prosecution.

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:23.012
Aye, aye, sir.

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:24.183
If you insist,

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:26.351
you can make a statement and
have it entered on the record.

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:28.453
No, no, that's not necessary.
- No, I insist.

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.794
I would like to say something.

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:33.566
I'm sorry.

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.996
I never should
have listened to Carl.

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:40.164
I should have done
the right thing. I just...

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:43.306
This whole thing
made you feel so happy.

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:45.778
And it made me
feel so important.

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:50.376
I should have told you the
truth. And I'm sorry I didn't.

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:53.114
I was just scared.

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:56.713
I also want to thank you.

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:01.491
I didn't like it sometimes,
but you made me grow up.

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:05.522
I know I was supposed to
help you have a baby.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.694
But you ended up teaching me
how to be a mother.

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:13.301
So thank you.
And I'm sorry.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:16.911
She'd be a great mom,
Your Honor.

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:18.172
<i>Kid wouldn't
get away with shit.</i>

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:20.077
Let's watch
the language, please.

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:22.116
Freedom of speech, look
it up, it's in the thing...

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.743
What Ms. Ostrowiski is
trying to say, Your Honor,

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:27.117
is that what
she did was wrong.

01:25:27.188 --> 01:25:29.019
It was extremely wrong.

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:30.114
Cool it, you're my lawyer.

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:32.523
And one of these lies, that's
so easy to spin out of control.

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:35.654
This guy, Carl Loomis,
he lied to Angie.

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:39.063
And then Angie lied to Kate,
and Kate lied to me,

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:42.236
and it was a mistake.
I mean, it was a...

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:45.837
It's a mess, this is all a...
It's a mess. This is a real mess.

01:25:45.907 --> 01:25:47.841
That's the worst closing
argument I've ever heard.

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:51.106
Yeah, I know.
I know. I'm a little rusty.

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:57.641
Kate. I just never wanted to come
back into a courtroom ever again.

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:01.817
And I came here for you.

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:03.723
Thank you.

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:06.059
I rest my case.

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:10.994
You Honor, I think we are more than
ready for you to read the results.

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:18.228
Let the record show that the DNA
test indicates that Ms. Holbrook

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:22.008
is not the mother
of this child.

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:50.629
Okay to get home?

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.138
Of course.
Yeah.

01:26:54.309 --> 01:26:58.177
I remember the day I found
out I was going to have a kid.

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:01.714
Wow. I'll never take it
for granted again.

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:05.913
Well, I'd still like
to meet that kid some time.

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:08.114
I'll give you a call.
You come by the store.

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:11.425
Okay, I'll definitely come by.

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:13.426
Okay.

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.587
I'm sorry, Kate.

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:17.096
It's okay.

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:19.633
I just threw up.

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.803
You look nice in a suit,
by the way.

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:01.407
Angie.

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:03.034
Hey.

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:07.146
So, I guess
I'll see you later?

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:09.709
Probably not, actually.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:10.940
Right.

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:14.849
I've been off Dr.
Pepper for two weeks.

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:17.213
This is water.

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.053
Good for you.

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.253
Thanks.

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.225
Angie, I think
your water broke.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.358
Wait, what?

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:27.765
Your water is breaking.

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:29.393
I got to get a bus to
take me to the hospital.

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.368
Let me drive you,
I'll drive you.

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:31.735
Okay, hold this.

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:33.569
I'm not due for three weeks.
- I know.

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:34.630
Should we
clean that up?

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:36.472
No, somebody else
will get that.

01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:47.354
This is really happening,
isn't it?

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.219
This is really happening.

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.755
It's so weird,
'cause I feel totally calm.

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:55.095
Come on, it feels like I'm shitting a knife.
- Okay.

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.528
Why won't you
bitches help me?

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:57.621
Just breathe.

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:59.098
Okay, I'll take it
from here.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:00.293
I want to go with her.

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:01.528
Are you family?

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:02.626
She's my sister.

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:03.966
Well, okay.

01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:05.369
Oh, God, holy...

01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:09.573
This way.
Sorry, sorry.

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:11.645
Give me some drugs. Give me this.
- You don't need drugs.

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:13.146
I want those drugs.
- No.

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:14.841
You'll never
get me, pig!

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:17.948
Get out of my way!

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:19.213
Oh, God!

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:20.879
Angie!

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:26.784
Is that guy dead?
Is he dead?

01:29:26.861 --> 01:29:29.091
We need some olive
oil to rub on my taint.

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:31.495
It's too late.
It's too late.

01:29:31.999 --> 01:29:33.660
Okay, this is
gonna go great.

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:34.827
Yeah.

01:29:34.902 --> 01:29:37.029
Kate.

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:39.401
It's twins.

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:43.266
Gross.

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:44.872
I don't know
what you're crying about.

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.743
I gotta walk out
of here alone.

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:49.282
That's a good joke,
Dr. Manheim.

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.445
Okay.

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:52.952
Okay, and give me
a big one.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:56.683
Big one! Whoa!

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:59.556
Nothing. Okay.
All right, ready?

01:29:59.627 --> 01:30:01.561
Kate, I'm so glad
you're here.

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.456
You don't look good,
by the way.

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:05.089
I feel a little dizzy.

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:06.929
Okay.
- Okay, and give me a big one.

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:10.061
Big one. Whoa.

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.399
Good morning.

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:23.178
Hi.
- How are you feeling?

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:25.981
Embarrassed. I fainted
in the delivery room.

01:30:26.053 --> 01:30:27.918
Well, Oscar's bringing you
a change of clothes,

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:30.184
and Mom is here,
in case you die.

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.452
Great.

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:34.290
And somebody else
wants to say hi. Hey.

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:38.459
It's embarrassing.

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:43.696
I'm scared your friend, Angie,
has me on speed dial.

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:46.239
She called me, like, 10 times to
get down here and take care of you.

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:47.604
Me, too.
- How is she?

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:48.835
How is the baby?

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:51.504
Great, she's just...
She's beautiful.

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:52.603
It's a girl.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:53.840
Got a smile...

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:55.314
Good morning.
- Hello.

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:56.407
Hi.

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:58.543
Hi, there. Hi.

01:30:58.753 --> 01:31:00.243
Could I have a moment
alone with Kate, please?

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:02.915
Sure. I'm going to
go check on Mom.

01:31:04.892 --> 01:31:06.553
Hi. How can I help you?

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:09.790
Hi. Well, we got
your blood work back.

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:12.992
You are slightly anemic,
which explains the fainting.

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:14.227
But there's something else
you need to know.

01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:15.734
You're pregnant.

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:18.402
That's impossible.

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:20.998
I paid a man thousands of dollars
to tell me that that's impossible.

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:24.943
Well, you're only about eight weeks
along, but you are definitely pregnant.

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:27.205
He said the chances
were one in a million.

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:30.408
Well, I'd start buying
lottery tickets, if I were you.

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:32.780
Wait a minute.

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:33.946
Congrats.

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:38.959
Rob.

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:44.093
I'm pregnant.
- What?

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:47.032
I'm pregnant.

01:31:48.302 --> 01:31:49.769
You okay?

01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:50.997
Oh, my God.

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:55.939
Hi. Can I see her?

01:31:57.245 --> 01:32:00.544
She's gorgeous.
What's her name?

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.615
This is Stef.

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:05.151
Stephanie,
that's beautiful.

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:07.949
No, Stefani.
Like Gwen Stefani.

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:11.253
Even better. Hello.

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:13.755
Are you waking up?

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:15.985
So, you're pregnant.

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.456
How'd you know that?

01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:19.796
I can read
people's energies.

01:32:20.234 --> 01:32:22.634
Plus, your sister told me.

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:31.770
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:38.748
<i>Happy birthday,
dear Stefani</i>

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:43.480
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:55.325
Hey, Angie.

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:58.405
Are you two
still together?

01:32:58.472 --> 01:33:00.303
No, we're not together.

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:04.271
He's just trying to be a better
father, take some parenting classes.

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.806
He just started.

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.143
I see you.

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:22.855
You think you're funny, punk? What'd
I tell you about hiding from me?

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:27.690
Quit hiding from me.
You think you're funny?

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:30.326
Hello.

01:33:41.582 --> 01:33:44.779
This is a gasoline-powered
mini-Ninja motorcycle.

01:33:44.852 --> 01:33:45.841
Oh, my God, Carl.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.945
You bought a motorcycle
for a one-year-old?

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:50.013
That is crazy.
- Really crazy.

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:52.582
That's exactly
what she wanted! Yay!

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.025
That's great.

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:05.762
Kate, let me give
your baby my mojo.

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:17.407
Well, time is love.
Got to run.

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.509
Whoa!

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:46.007
I love
this episode.
