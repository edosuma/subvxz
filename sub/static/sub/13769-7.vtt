WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:11.052
Hey, Mom, I grew an inch!

00:11.094 --> 00:13.764
♪ Life is unfair... ♪

00:16.600 --> 00:19.311
Stevie, come on.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.311
That's ten in a row.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.438
I'm sick... of this.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.857
It's important!

00:22.898 --> 00:24.274
I worked my butt off

00:22.898 --> 00:24.274
to make the JV team.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.693
I got to stay sharp.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.277
Could you at least

00:25.734 --> 00:27.277
try  to block it?

00:32.741 --> 00:33.951
Still too easy.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.077
Can I put you

00:33.993 --> 00:36.077
on a ladder?

00:36.119 --> 00:37.120
Come back, please!

00:37.162 --> 00:38.580
I'll find us a ride!

00:38.622 --> 00:41.082
Those concert tickets

00:38.622 --> 00:41.082
cost me $40 each.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.376
That's two times 40.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.337
Divide that in two,

00:42.417 --> 00:45.337
and it's $40 a ticket!

00:45.379 --> 00:47.088
But it's not my fault

00:45.379 --> 00:47.088
I can't drive us.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.174
You're the one who had

00:47.130 --> 00:49.174
his license taken away!

00:49.216 --> 00:50.926
Because my public defender

00:50.968 --> 00:53.136
wouldn't even try

00:50.968 --> 00:53.136
the insanity defense.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.930
Well, you better

00:53.178 --> 00:54.930
think of something,

00:54.972 --> 00:56.264
because if we

00:54.972 --> 00:56.264
can't get there,

00:56.306 --> 00:58.392
then we're not going!

00:59.727 --> 01:02.897
Don't ever date

00:59.727 --> 01:02.897
anyone smarter than you.

01:02.938 --> 01:03.898
Okay, break's over.

01:03.939 --> 01:04.899
Let's get back to work.

01:04.940 --> 01:05.900
You take it out.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.108
I want to work

01:05.941 --> 01:07.108
on my defense.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.485
And this time,

01:07.150 --> 01:08.485
don't just sit there.

01:08.527 --> 01:09.862
Try to move

01:08.527 --> 01:09.862
the ball around.

01:12.531 --> 01:15.116
My... bad.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.118
I'm sorry. I know

01:15.158 --> 01:17.118
I'm being a little crazy,

01:17.160 --> 01:18.787
but for the first time

01:17.160 --> 01:18.787
in my life,

01:18.829 --> 01:20.163
I'm actually good

01:18.829 --> 01:20.163
at something

01:20.205 --> 01:21.623
that normal people

01:20.205 --> 01:21.623
care about.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.709
Being on the team

01:21.665 --> 01:23.709
is the best thing

01:23.751 --> 01:26.127
that's ever happened to me

01:23.751 --> 01:26.127
and I don't want to screw it up.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.963
All I'm saying is

01:26.169 --> 01:27.963
that if we want to win,

01:28.005 --> 01:29.214
which I think we do,

01:29.256 --> 01:31.132
it seems to me we should

01:29.256 --> 01:31.132
be using an offense

01:31.174 --> 01:33.134
that has a remote chance

01:31.174 --> 01:33.134
of actually working.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.136
I can't be the only one here

01:33.176 --> 01:35.136
who thinks

01:35.178 --> 01:37.598
there's something deeply flawed

01:35.178 --> 01:37.598
with your game plan.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.059
I think if you thought about it

01:37.639 --> 01:40.059
for just a second,

01:40.099 --> 01:42.603
you'd realize you need

01:40.099 --> 01:42.603
to make some changes.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.397
What the hell is wrong with me?!

01:45.439 --> 01:47.190
Why can't I just learn

01:45.439 --> 01:47.190
to shut up?

01:47.232 --> 01:50.110
We're... the same.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.821
We speak...

01:52.863 --> 01:56.241
before... we think.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.410
LOIS:

01:56.283 --> 01:58.410
Malcolm!

01:58.452 --> 02:01.789
How many times do I have to tell

01:58.452 --> 02:01.789
you to hang up your wet towel

02:01.830 --> 02:03.082
after you've used it?!

02:03.123 --> 02:04.165
Is that so hard?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.375
Because if it is,

02:05.417 --> 02:06.668
maybe we should just

02:05.417 --> 02:06.668
take your towel away.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.169
And the next time

02:06.710 --> 02:08.169
you take a shower,

02:08.211 --> 02:10.171
you can run around the backyard

02:08.211 --> 02:10.171
until you dry.

02:10.213 --> 02:13.801
Gee, Mom, wouldn't the front

02:10.213 --> 02:13.801
yard be more humiliating?

02:13.842 --> 02:15.469
Sorry.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.887
And I don't want any...

02:16.929 --> 02:17.888
What did you say?

02:17.930 --> 02:18.973
I'm sorry.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.433
Yes. Well...

02:21.475 --> 02:24.227
I can see you boys

02:21.475 --> 02:24.227
are studying,

02:24.269 --> 02:27.147
so maybe this isn't the best

02:24.269 --> 02:27.147
time to deal with this.

02:28.231 --> 02:32.152
Do you want any sodas

02:28.231 --> 02:32.152
or anything?

02:35.447 --> 02:37.198
You're sure you like

02:35.447 --> 02:37.198
your birthday present?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.408
Dad, the boots are perfect.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.201
They're just what I wanted.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.201
Listen,

02:40.243 --> 02:42.203
they were really expensive,

02:40.243 --> 02:42.203
so take good care of them, okay?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.580
I will. Don't worry about it.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.833
Thanks again, Dad.

02:45.874 --> 02:46.792
(sighs)

02:46.834 --> 02:49.128
What the hell

02:46.834 --> 02:49.128
are you doing?

02:49.168 --> 02:50.838
Piama, this is an

02:49.168 --> 02:50.838
old cowboy trick.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.255
You soak your

02:50.879 --> 02:52.255
boots in water,

02:52.297 --> 02:54.633
and you don't take them off,

02:52.297 --> 02:54.633
even for a minute,

02:54.675 --> 02:56.217
until they are

02:54.675 --> 02:56.217
completely dry,

02:56.259 --> 02:57.845
even if it takes days.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.139
And when you're done,

02:57.886 --> 03:00.139
they fit like a glove.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.389
I know it

03:00.179 --> 03:01.389
seems drastic,

03:01.431 --> 03:03.224
but believe me,

03:01.431 --> 03:03.224
I know what I'm doing.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.435
Those are $300 boots

03:03.266 --> 03:05.435
you just ruined.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.895
I didn't ruin

03:05.477 --> 03:06.895
anything.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.605
This is what you're

03:06.937 --> 03:08.605
supposed to do!

03:08.647 --> 03:10.524
You're going to have

03:08.647 --> 03:10.524
to trust me on this.

03:10.565 --> 03:14.695
Why do you always talk to me

03:10.565 --> 03:14.695
like I'm an idiot?

03:17.531 --> 03:20.034
"...and everyone

03:17.531 --> 03:20.034
but the rabbit

03:20.075 --> 03:21.910
lived happily ever after."

03:21.952 --> 03:23.704
And the moral

03:21.952 --> 03:23.704
of that fable, son,

03:23.745 --> 03:25.831
is that turtles

03:23.745 --> 03:25.831
are pathological liars

03:25.873 --> 03:27.499
who won't give you their gold.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.168
Got it.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.925
♪ ♪

03:46.351 --> 03:48.478
Dad?

03:57.320 --> 04:01.282
It's like watching the gods

03:57.320 --> 04:01.282
return to Olympus.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.785
Oh, uh, hello...

04:01.324 --> 04:03.785
excuse me...

04:03.827 --> 04:05.954
Hey! What is

04:03.827 --> 04:05.954
this called?

04:05.996 --> 04:07.497
We're racewalking.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.499
I've never seen anything

04:07.539 --> 04:09.499
like it.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.292
The... the style, the grace.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.587
Well, it's not

04:11.334 --> 04:13.587
all just about looking good.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.965
It's the best low-impact

04:13.628 --> 04:16.965
aerobic exercise ever invented,

04:17.007 --> 04:19.300
despite what you hear

04:17.007 --> 04:19.300
from all those Tai-Chi punks.

04:19.342 --> 04:20.928
Yeah, but how

04:19.342 --> 04:20.928
do you do it?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.597
Well, the International

04:20.969 --> 04:23.597
Racewalking Federation specifies

04:23.638 --> 04:25.807
you must have one foot

04:23.638 --> 04:25.807
on the ground at all times.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.226
But...

04:27.267 --> 04:28.309
And your front leg

04:27.267 --> 04:28.309
must remain straight

04:28.351 --> 04:29.310
until it's completely under you.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.897
Something

04:29.352 --> 04:31.897
like this?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.982
Hey! I think you've got it!

04:34.024 --> 04:36.777
Look at that, guys. I think

04:34.024 --> 04:36.777
we got ourselves a natural!

04:36.818 --> 04:37.819
(giggles)

04:37.861 --> 04:40.321
(all cheering)

04:37.861 --> 04:40.321
Wow!

04:40.363 --> 04:41.322
Look at me!

04:41.364 --> 04:44.325
I can walk!

04:41.364 --> 04:44.325
Yeah!

04:44.367 --> 04:45.493
NICKI:

04:44.367 --> 04:45.493
So then what happens is

04:45.535 --> 04:47.328
I'm sitting there

04:45.535 --> 04:47.328
eating my lunch when

04:47.370 --> 04:49.248
Carla comes up to me and

04:47.370 --> 04:49.248
she's completely furious at me

04:49.289 --> 04:50.415
because Cody dumped her.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.959
I mean, yeah, I'm the

04:50.457 --> 04:51.959
one who set then up,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.335
but does that make it

04:52.000 --> 04:54.335
my responsibility?

04:54.377 --> 04:55.336
Why are you asking me?

04:55.378 --> 04:58.924
I don't even know these people.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.926
I know, I know.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.926
I can see her side, too,

05:00.968 --> 05:03.220
but she was completely

05:00.968 --> 05:03.220
screaming at me.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.346
And now I feel bad

05:03.262 --> 05:05.346
because she was crying,

05:05.388 --> 05:06.640
and I just kept thinking,

05:06.681 --> 05:08.850
"Did I do something

05:06.681 --> 05:08.850
so totally wrong?"

05:08.892 --> 05:10.351
I honestly don't care.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.353
My parents are going

05:10.393 --> 05:12.353
to be home any minute.

05:12.395 --> 05:15.065
Can we  please  start making out

05:12.395 --> 05:15.065
while we still have time?

05:16.858 --> 05:17.943
Uh-uh.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.569
Oh, Malcolm, thank you so much.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.071
I'm so lucky to have you.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.447
You make me feel so good.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.365
Wow, this is fantastic.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.161
I'm never going to say

05:24.407 --> 05:27.161
what's on my mind ever again.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.370
All I have to do

05:27.202 --> 05:29.370
is keep my mouth shut.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.665
Just not say a word and let her

05:29.412 --> 05:31.665
do all the talking and...

05:31.706 --> 05:33.374
Dad, please.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.210
The concert's Saturday night.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.210
I need a ride!

05:35.252 --> 05:36.878
Reese, no!

05:36.920 --> 05:39.256
Your mom has to work

05:36.920 --> 05:39.256
and my car's in the shop.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.549
You'll just have to

05:39.298 --> 05:41.549
find someone else.

05:41.591 --> 05:42.676
Are my hips even?

05:42.717 --> 05:44.385
Watch my butt

05:42.717 --> 05:44.385
while I walk.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.471
Dad, I swear to God,

05:46.513 --> 05:49.183
if you don't drive me,

05:46.513 --> 05:49.183
I will leave home forever!

05:49.224 --> 05:52.060
Or I'll never leave--

05:49.224 --> 05:52.060
whatever's worse.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.521
It's your choice, pal.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.440
I think you're

05:55.605 --> 05:57.440
going to like this.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.442
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.861
I put it in my mouth,

06:00.902 --> 06:02.570
your toenail

06:00.902 --> 06:02.570
clippings are in it,

06:02.612 --> 06:05.406
I spit it out, and you've

06:02.612 --> 06:05.406
got it all on video.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.407
It's been done.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.868
I am so sorry about that.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.411
But we've both grown up

06:07.909 --> 06:10.411
a lot since then,

06:10.453 --> 06:13.372
and I have a proposal I think

06:10.453 --> 06:13.372
you might find interesting.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.502
It's still warm.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.130
Now, I know

06:17.544 --> 06:20.130
a hip guy like you

06:20.172 --> 06:22.090
keeps up with

06:20.172 --> 06:22.090
the current music scene.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.466
It's awfully short notice

06:23.508 --> 06:25.510
and you're probably

06:23.508 --> 06:25.510
not even available.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.846
What are you

06:25.552 --> 06:27.846
talking about?

06:27.888 --> 06:30.349
There's a concert

06:27.888 --> 06:30.349
this Saturday,

06:30.389 --> 06:32.893
and Alison and I were wondering

06:30.389 --> 06:32.893
if you'd like to go.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.146
You want  me  to go to

06:32.934 --> 06:36.146
a concert with  you?

06:36.188 --> 06:38.439
Yeah, pretty much.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.439
But the real fun part

06:38.481 --> 06:40.441
is the drive there

06:38.481 --> 06:40.441
and the drive back.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.443
But I don't have

06:40.483 --> 06:42.443
to tell you, right?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
I mean, look who

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
I'm talking to--

06:44.487 --> 06:46.531
a single, middle-aged guy

06:44.487 --> 06:46.531
with a cat?

06:46.573 --> 06:48.616
You know all about

06:46.573 --> 06:48.616
the dating scene.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.869
Well, sure, that's

06:48.658 --> 06:50.869
my rep, but...

06:50.911 --> 06:52.453
I mean, it's not

06:50.911 --> 06:52.453
like you're even excited

06:52.495 --> 06:53.914
to go out on a  real  date.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.290
It's not

06:53.955 --> 06:55.290
like it's something

06:55.332 --> 06:56.499
that you'd be bragging

06:55.332 --> 06:56.499
about for weeks...

06:56.541 --> 06:58.126
(laughs): Of course not.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.126
I mean, who cares?

06:58.168 --> 07:00.045
But... if people

06:58.168 --> 07:00.045
were to ask,

07:00.087 --> 07:02.505
I'm not  forbidden

07:00.087 --> 07:02.505
to tell them, am I?

07:02.547 --> 07:05.050
Not at all.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.050
This is going to be great.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.760
And you say I can

07:05.092 --> 07:06.760
tell people, right?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.722
Hello, everybody!

07:10.764 --> 07:13.308
Hey, Hal!

07:10.764 --> 07:13.308
Hey, it's "The Natural!"

07:13.350 --> 07:14.935
I have to tell you, Hal,

07:13.350 --> 07:14.935
I've never seen anybody

07:14.976 --> 07:16.395
take to the sport

07:14.976 --> 07:16.395
as fast as you.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.645
What's it been,

07:16.436 --> 07:17.645
three days?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.564
Already, you're

07:17.687 --> 07:19.564
better than I am.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.900
Now, now, it's not

07:19.606 --> 07:21.900
about the competition.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.485
I mean, it's not a race, right?

07:24.527 --> 07:25.779
ALL:

07:24.527 --> 07:25.779
Whoa!

07:30.117 --> 07:32.202
It's only a matter of time

07:30.117 --> 07:32.202
till we're surrounded.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.371
Now, we've got to get word

07:32.244 --> 07:34.371
to Allied Command,

07:34.413 --> 07:36.081
but any radio messages

07:34.413 --> 07:36.081
will be intercepted.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.332
You think I don't know that?

07:37.374 --> 07:38.499
I've sent

07:38.541 --> 07:39.834
for our secret weapon.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.965
(panting)

07:45.006 --> 07:46.758
You called for me, sir?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.302
Corporal.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.302
I don't need to tell you

07:48.343 --> 07:50.511
the fate of the entire

07:48.343 --> 07:50.511
free world

07:50.553 --> 07:52.931
depends on you

07:50.553 --> 07:52.931
delivering this message

07:52.973 --> 07:54.724
to Allied Command by morning.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.518
My God, that's 60 miles away.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.729
I'll say hello to

07:57.560 --> 07:59.729
the boys at HQ for you

07:59.771 --> 08:02.023
over waffles, sir.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.781
Let's just thank God

08:06.027 --> 08:09.781
he's on our side.

08:10.949 --> 08:14.286
Oh, my God,

08:10.949 --> 08:14.286
it's Wheeler.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.748
He must be back

08:17.247 --> 08:18.748
from the Nationals.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.922
On your left.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.966
On your left!

08:25.964 --> 08:27.966
(yelps)

08:29.009 --> 08:31.261
On your right!

08:29.009 --> 08:31.261
On your left!

08:31.303 --> 08:32.471
On your right!

08:32.512 --> 08:34.514
(yelps)

08:41.271 --> 08:42.647
Okay, just be cool.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.066
No matter what he says,

08:42.689 --> 08:45.066
don't say anything.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.818
How much simpler

08:45.108 --> 08:46.818
can it get?!

08:46.860 --> 08:49.570
You pass, pass, pass,

08:46.860 --> 08:49.570
dribble, dribble, pass,

08:49.612 --> 08:50.864
dribble, pass, shoot!

08:50.905 --> 08:53.574
Um, excuse me, Coach.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.953
Well, well, well...

08:53.616 --> 08:56.953
look who's here.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.873
Coach, I'd like to apologize

08:56.995 --> 08:59.873
for the other day.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.167
I'd like to get

08:59.914 --> 09:02.167
back on the team.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.462
So, you'd like to apologize

09:02.209 --> 09:05.462
and get back on the team?

09:05.504 --> 09:07.672
I think I just said that, yes.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.675
Do you know what this is?

09:11.676 --> 09:14.179
A symbol of my authority.

09:14.221 --> 09:18.058
They don't just hand these

09:14.221 --> 09:18.058
whistles out to just anybody.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.435
It means that I'm in charge.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.603
I call the plays. Understood?

09:22.645 --> 09:26.566
Yeah. It's a  magic  whistle

09:22.645 --> 09:26.566
that makes you all-powerful.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.652
All right.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.238
You're back on the team.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.704
(panting)

09:39.746 --> 09:41.039
Time!

09:41.081 --> 09:43.417
25 minutes

09:41.081 --> 09:43.417
and 43.2 seconds.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.625
Damn!

09:44.667 --> 09:45.919
Are you sure you

09:44.667 --> 09:45.919
started it exactly

09:45.960 --> 09:47.628
when I called

09:45.960 --> 09:47.628
you from work?

09:47.670 --> 09:49.506
Yes. Do you want me

09:47.670 --> 09:49.506
to lie to you?

09:49.548 --> 09:52.092
All right, go ahead

09:49.548 --> 09:52.092
and log in the time, son.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.634
Hey, look, Malcolm, come here.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.554
I need you to help me

09:53.676 --> 09:55.554
make sense of all these times.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.305
Now, these are

09:55.595 --> 09:57.305
the last three days.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.224
Some of these are with the cap,

09:57.347 --> 09:59.224
some without.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.934
Some with bike shorts,

09:59.266 --> 10:00.934
some without; one with both,

10:00.975 --> 10:02.269
one in just my pajamas.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.811
So you can whip up

10:03.853 --> 10:05.730
some kind of scientific analysis

10:03.853 --> 10:05.730
of all this, right?

10:05.772 --> 10:09.650
Sure, I've only got better to

10:05.772 --> 10:09.650
do with the rest of my life.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.735
Okay.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.113
You're a good son.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.656
By the way, how much

10:13.154 --> 10:15.656
allowance are we giving you?

10:15.698 --> 10:17.951
What family do you live in?

10:17.992 --> 10:19.660
Nothing, why?

10:19.702 --> 10:22.163
Well, how does five bucks

10:19.702 --> 10:22.163
a week sound?

10:22.205 --> 10:24.082
Great.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.082
Hey!

10:22.205 --> 10:24.082
(yells)

10:24.124 --> 10:26.667
Dewey, he's older, and he

10:24.124 --> 10:26.667
doesn't give me as much malarkey

10:26.709 --> 10:28.628
when I ask him for a favor.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.880
Are you biting

10:29.712 --> 10:30.880
your nails again?

10:30.922 --> 10:31.881
Those look horrible.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.175
No. They're fine.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.761
(doorbell ringing)

10:36.803 --> 10:38.679
Look, I've only

10:36.803 --> 10:38.679
got two minutes.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.308
A woman thinks I'm looking in

10:38.721 --> 10:41.308
the stock room for a humidifier.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.143
Now, I want you

10:41.349 --> 10:43.143
to listen to this tape

10:43.184 --> 10:44.685
and tell me whether

10:43.184 --> 10:44.685
you think it's better

10:44.727 --> 10:47.939
to go ELO-Kansas-Doobies

10:44.727 --> 10:47.939
or Doobies-Kansas-ELO.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.690
I'm not telling you

10:47.981 --> 10:49.690
which one I'm voting for.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.691
What are you

10:49.732 --> 10:50.691
talking about?

10:50.733 --> 10:52.693
The mix tape! For our date!

10:52.735 --> 10:55.530
Didn't you get my e-mails

10:52.735 --> 10:55.530
or phone messages

10:55.572 --> 10:57.073
or the notes I left

10:55.572 --> 10:57.073
under your door?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.699
No, I have a lot of homework

10:57.115 --> 10:58.699
to do during the week,

10:58.741 --> 11:00.619
and I can't

10:58.741 --> 11:00.619
really spend...

11:00.660 --> 11:02.078
Look, just listen

11:00.660 --> 11:02.078
to it tonight

11:02.120 --> 11:04.164
and get back to me with

11:02.120 --> 11:04.164
your top four choices.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.166
Now, what do you

11:04.205 --> 11:06.166
think for a shirt?

11:06.207 --> 11:07.708
I like the blue,

11:06.207 --> 11:07.708
but I'm worried

11:07.750 --> 11:09.877
the open-collar look

11:07.750 --> 11:09.877
is a bit racy.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.630
You don't have

11:09.919 --> 11:11.630
any pants on!

11:11.671 --> 11:13.214
That's what these are for.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.882
I want you to pick your

11:13.256 --> 11:14.882
favorites separately,

11:14.924 --> 11:16.551
then we'll decide

11:14.924 --> 11:16.551
what goes together.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.012
Whatever.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.012
(giggles)

11:19.053 --> 11:22.974
I am going to call you

11:19.053 --> 11:22.974
a million times before Saturday.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.934
I haven't been this

11:23.016 --> 11:24.934
excited in years.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.562
Now I know why people

11:24.976 --> 11:27.562
look forward to weekends.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.314

Yes, ma'am.

Look at me.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.832
Are you on drugs?

13:09.372 --> 13:11.832
What?

13:11.874 --> 13:13.042
You've been acting

13:11.874 --> 13:13.042
really strange lately,

13:13.084 --> 13:14.835
and I want to know

13:13.084 --> 13:14.835
what's going on.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.004
Well, apparently no one

13:14.877 --> 13:17.004
in this house can tolerate it

13:17.046 --> 13:19.716
when someone's

13:17.046 --> 13:19.716
actually being pleasant!

13:19.758 --> 13:20.841
Nothing.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.302
Nothing?

13:22.343 --> 13:24.053
So, everything's fine,

13:22.343 --> 13:24.053
everything's normal,

13:24.095 --> 13:26.264
you're not acting any different,

13:24.095 --> 13:26.264
and I'm just crazy.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.141
She's begging for it! Nail her!

13:28.182 --> 13:30.017
I'm fine, really.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.894
Well, you're looking

13:30.059 --> 13:31.894
a little tired.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.647
Why don't you let me finish up?

13:33.688 --> 13:35.732
All right.

13:38.568 --> 13:42.071
Dad, please,

13:38.568 --> 13:42.071
it's been three hours.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.864
Come on, Wheeler,

13:43.906 --> 13:44.865
give me something.

13:44.907 --> 13:45.950
What's your secret?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.868
You're starting

13:45.992 --> 13:47.868
to ruin TV for me.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.371
I study your moves,

13:47.910 --> 13:50.371
I copy your techniques,

13:50.413 --> 13:53.874
but somehow you continue

13:50.413 --> 13:53.874
to  blow  me out of the water.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.543
Why?! How?!

13:55.585 --> 13:57.337
Maybe he's just

13:55.585 --> 13:57.337
better than you.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.172
Have you ever

13:57.378 --> 13:59.172
thought of that?

13:59.213 --> 14:00.465
Billy Vargas can spit

14:00.507 --> 14:02.967
ten feet further than I can.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.719
I accept that.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.887
Why can't you?

14:06.929 --> 14:09.265
Oh, Dewey, maybe

14:06.929 --> 14:09.265
you're right.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.892
Maybe God didn't put me on

14:09.307 --> 14:11.892
this Earth to beat this guy.

14:11.934 --> 14:12.893
I mean, look at him.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.604
Perfect posture,

14:14.646 --> 14:17.106
great hip rotation, his...

14:17.148 --> 14:19.233
Wait a minute.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.778
Both feet off the ground

14:21.820 --> 14:23.780
at the same time!

14:23.822 --> 14:27.116
Dewey, do you see that?!

14:27.158 --> 14:28.909
That's  air.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.911
That... that's air!

14:30.953 --> 14:32.330
That's it!

14:32.372 --> 14:34.123
I'm going to go read a book!

14:34.165 --> 14:36.917
I hope you're happy!

14:36.959 --> 14:40.087
Now, since Jeanette got the

14:36.959 --> 14:40.087
T-shirt from my last 50K,

14:40.129 --> 14:43.424
I think it's only fair to

14:40.129 --> 14:43.424
give you girls my socks.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.634
(both gasp)

14:44.676 --> 14:45.844
Oh, my God!

14:45.885 --> 14:47.136
Sorry to interrupt, Wheeler,

14:47.178 --> 14:48.596
but I thought

14:47.178 --> 14:48.596
we could have a little race.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.973
Apparently, this man's

14:48.638 --> 14:50.973
a lot like you girls--

14:51.015 --> 14:53.560
you all can't get enough

14:51.015 --> 14:53.560
of looking at my backside.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.602
(laughter)

14:54.644 --> 14:56.937
This shouldn't

14:54.644 --> 14:56.937
take long.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
Oh, and just

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
one more thing.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.735
This time,

14:58.981 --> 15:01.735
just to be different, let's...

15:01.776 --> 15:03.444
walk.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.572
What are you talking about?

15:05.613 --> 15:06.947
You thought

15:05.613 --> 15:06.947
no one would discover

15:06.989 --> 15:08.616
your dirty little secret,

15:06.989 --> 15:08.616
didn't you?

15:08.658 --> 15:09.950
That clever little

15:09.992 --> 15:11.411
flail of the wrist

15:09.992 --> 15:11.411
every four steps,

15:11.452 --> 15:12.662
masking the hop.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.539
(crowd gasps)

15:14.581 --> 15:15.998
But you can't fool the tape.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.167
The tape sees all,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.167
and I see the tape.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.960
You are not a racewalker

15:18.209 --> 15:19.960
at all.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.962
You're nothing

15:20.002 --> 15:21.962
but a common jogger.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.631
(crowd gasps)

15:23.673 --> 15:25.966
That is so rid...

15:26.008 --> 15:28.344
Don't worry.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.554
He won't get far.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.473
(crowd cheering)

15:32.515 --> 15:35.268
One-two-three, there!

15:35.309 --> 15:37.103
One-two-three, there!

15:45.027 --> 15:46.237
(screaming)

15:47.739 --> 15:48.740
(screaming)

15:56.330 --> 15:58.124
(screaming)

16:02.921 --> 16:05.005
(grunting)

16:11.053 --> 16:12.597
So, then, when I was 13,

16:12.639 --> 16:15.642
I got my first velour shirt,

16:12.639 --> 16:15.642
and everything changed.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.519
Suddenly, there was an opening

16:15.683 --> 16:18.519
in the astronomy club.

16:18.561 --> 16:21.021
People started sitting

16:18.561 --> 16:21.021
on my side of the bus.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.023
But I'm a Libra,

16:21.063 --> 16:23.023
so I like to think

16:23.065 --> 16:24.317
the best of people.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.026
So, Craig, I was telling Alison

16:26.068 --> 16:28.279
how well you focus

16:26.068 --> 16:28.279
on your driving.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.030
No, you were

16:28.321 --> 16:30.030
just telling me

16:30.072 --> 16:31.658
that if I really loved you,

16:30.072 --> 16:31.658
I'd let you get under my...

16:31.699 --> 16:34.034
So, you guys like

16:31.699 --> 16:34.034
to take long walks on the beach?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.620
I sure do.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.831
Plus, I'm a grand master

16:35.662 --> 16:37.831
at Battleship.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.040
I've got the hat

16:37.872 --> 16:40.040
if you'd like to see it.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.002
So, Ali, do you have any

16:40.082 --> 16:43.002
brothers or sisters?

16:44.086 --> 16:45.296
What do you think

16:44.086 --> 16:45.296
you're doing?!

16:45.338 --> 16:47.047
You don't talk to me.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.047
You just start kissing?

16:47.089 --> 16:48.633
I am a person,

16:47.089 --> 16:48.633
and I deserve

16:48.675 --> 16:51.051
some conversation

16:48.675 --> 16:51.051
and some of the social niceties

16:51.093 --> 16:52.553
before the kissing starts.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.138
You know what, I was okay

16:52.595 --> 16:54.138
when he pulled over twice

16:54.180 --> 16:55.765
to change his shirt,

16:54.180 --> 16:55.765
but I really don't think

16:55.807 --> 16:57.057
he should be yelling at me.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.768
Okay, don't freak out.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.768
I can handle this.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.687
My family kind

16:58.810 --> 17:00.687
of owns him.

17:00.728 --> 17:04.064
You know, Craig, another

17:00.728 --> 17:04.064
thing girls really like

17:04.106 --> 17:05.859
is the strong,

17:04.106 --> 17:05.859
silent type.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.486
Craig, Craig,

17:05.900 --> 17:08.486
you just passed the concert!

17:08.528 --> 17:09.863
Oh, no, I don't think so.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.781
But there was a sign,

17:09.904 --> 17:11.781
and it had an arrow,

17:11.823 --> 17:14.283
and we're supposed

17:11.823 --> 17:14.283
to follow the pointy end!

17:14.325 --> 17:15.576
Oh, come on.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.370
There's other fun things

17:15.618 --> 17:17.370
we can do.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.288
I thought we'd start

17:17.411 --> 17:19.288
with a hayride,

17:19.330 --> 17:20.915
and then a light

17:19.330 --> 17:20.915
dinner at Cicero's.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.124
I've already tipped

17:20.957 --> 17:22.124
the violinist

17:22.166 --> 17:23.877
to drop by our table,

17:22.166 --> 17:23.877
for the lady.

17:23.918 --> 17:25.879
Then I thought

17:23.918 --> 17:25.879
we'd cap off the evening

17:25.920 --> 17:27.964
with a nice, romantic bonfire

17:25.920 --> 17:27.964
at the lake.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.591
Craig, you are

17:28.006 --> 17:30.591
ruining our date!

17:30.633 --> 17:32.134
(tires screech)

17:32.176 --> 17:33.344
Now, listen here!

17:33.386 --> 17:34.888
Do you know how long

17:34.929 --> 17:36.723
I have dreamed

17:34.929 --> 17:36.723
and planned for this night?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.808
34 years!

17:38.850 --> 17:41.268
And I am not going to let

17:38.850 --> 17:41.268
you little brats ruin it!

17:41.310 --> 17:44.939
We are going to have a hayride

17:41.310 --> 17:44.939
and dinner and a bonfire,

17:44.981 --> 17:47.274
and this is going

17:44.981 --> 17:47.274
to be a magical evening

17:47.316 --> 17:49.819
that will live

17:47.316 --> 17:49.819
in our hearts  forever!

17:49.861 --> 17:51.362
What's that

17:49.861 --> 17:51.362
on your glasses?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.113
What?

17:53.155 --> 17:54.574
(screaming)

17:54.615 --> 17:55.950
Oh, my God!

17:55.992 --> 17:59.119
Reese, you said

17:55.992 --> 17:59.119
she'd be nice to me!

17:59.161 --> 18:02.122
You said she'd like me!

17:59.161 --> 18:02.122
(sobbing)

18:02.164 --> 18:04.584
Yeah, let's ditch this loser.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.919
Okay, okay.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.127
See you at school.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.839
CRAIG (sobbing):

18:07.169 --> 18:09.839
Why?

18:09.881 --> 18:11.131
Well, as you can see,

18:11.173 --> 18:12.967
Miss Doubting Piama,

18:11.173 --> 18:12.967
it may have taken

18:13.009 --> 18:15.135
days and days

18:13.009 --> 18:15.135
of wearing sopping wet boots,

18:15.177 --> 18:18.765
but they are now snug, supple

18:15.177 --> 18:18.765
and perfectly form-fitting.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.140
You were right, honey.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.642
Which would also make you...

18:21.684 --> 18:23.019
Mistaken.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.353
You know, I could

18:24.395 --> 18:27.314
push for a more abject admission

18:24.395 --> 18:27.314
of your wrongness,

18:27.356 --> 18:29.609
but I'm going

18:27.356 --> 18:29.609
to be a bigger man.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.985
With better boots.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.779
Call me

18:31.027 --> 18:32.779
when you get tired of this.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.447
Could be late.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.115
(door closes)

18:39.201 --> 18:40.912
Oh...!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.543
If I hold out for a few days,

18:47.585 --> 18:50.671
maybe the fungus

18:47.585 --> 18:50.671
will eat the mushrooms.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.758
How can we be losing

18:52.090 --> 18:53.758
to a team

18:53.800 --> 18:56.094
that hasn't won a game

18:53.800 --> 18:56.094
in three years?!

18:56.135 --> 18:58.554
Maybe because

18:56.135 --> 18:58.554
you're a complete moron!

18:58.596 --> 19:00.014
You know I can shoot!

19:00.056 --> 19:01.474
Why won't you put me in?!

19:01.515 --> 19:03.017
For God's sake,

19:01.515 --> 19:03.017
that's it.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.184
Time-out!

19:04.226 --> 19:06.186
All right,

19:04.226 --> 19:06.186
everybody up, come on!

19:06.228 --> 19:07.187
All right,

19:07.229 --> 19:08.689
you yo-yos.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.608
Do you want to know why

19:08.731 --> 19:10.608
we can't beat this team?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.902
Because you're

19:10.650 --> 19:12.902
not letting anyone shoot!

19:12.944 --> 19:15.195
We're just passing the ball

19:12.944 --> 19:15.195
back and forth!

19:15.237 --> 19:16.823
Nobody on this team

19:15.237 --> 19:16.823
has any heart.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.449
Not a man.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.035
You know, when the Allies

19:18.491 --> 19:21.035
first hit the beach at Iwo Jima,

19:21.077 --> 19:23.663
they didn't have better weapons

19:21.077 --> 19:23.663
than the Germans.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.206
They had something more

19:23.704 --> 19:26.206
than firepower.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.668
Have you completely

19:26.248 --> 19:28.668
lost your mind?!

19:28.709 --> 19:29.919
Put me in!

19:29.961 --> 19:34.214
Let me shoot... the... ball!

19:34.256 --> 19:36.092
Not one of you

19:34.256 --> 19:36.092
has been able to forget

19:36.134 --> 19:39.012
about the water in your boots,

19:36.134 --> 19:39.012
or the sand in your mess kit

19:39.053 --> 19:42.056
long enough to focus on

19:39.053 --> 19:42.056
the success of the entire unit!

19:42.098 --> 19:44.600
(distorted):  Tell him to shut up

19:42.098 --> 19:44.600
and put you in.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.686
Tell him, tell him!

19:46.727 --> 19:50.272
Malcolm... do you think

19:46.727 --> 19:50.272
you  can follow my game plan?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.150
No, because

19:50.314 --> 19:52.150
you're a freakin' idiot.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.734
I hate you.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.236
I want to kill you and dance

19:53.776 --> 19:56.236
on your shallow grave.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.197
That's my game plan.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.159
All right, get in there.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.660
Thanks.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.042
A peptic ulcer?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.127
How did you manage

20:09.083 --> 20:11.127
to get a peptic ulcer?

20:11.169 --> 20:13.253
The doctor said you

20:11.169 --> 20:13.253
have the stomach lining

20:13.295 --> 20:15.255
of a 60-year-old air

20:13.295 --> 20:15.255
traffic controller.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.091
You are a teenager,

20:15.297 --> 20:17.091
for God's sake.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.135
What do you have

20:17.133 --> 20:19.135
to be stressed about?!

20:21.762 --> 20:23.263
For your information,

20:23.305 --> 20:25.141
I just spent the past

20:23.305 --> 20:25.141
three hours on a gurney

20:25.183 --> 20:26.976
next to a guy

20:25.183 --> 20:26.976
who is still trying to smoke

20:27.018 --> 20:28.268
out of the hole in his neck.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.437
And the jackass

20:28.310 --> 20:30.437
who put in this I.V.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.773
couldn't find a vein

20:30.479 --> 20:32.773
with two hands and a flashlight!

20:32.815 --> 20:34.358
My call button

20:32.815 --> 20:34.358
doesn't work!

20:34.400 --> 20:35.943
These stupid sheets

20:34.400 --> 20:35.943
are itchy.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.570
There's only one channel

20:35.985 --> 20:37.570
on the TV.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.363
And what's this

20:37.611 --> 20:39.363
about a bedpan?!

20:41.365 --> 20:43.283
This is great, isn't it?

20:43.325 --> 20:44.994
Alison's nice,

20:43.325 --> 20:44.994
but I have to say

20:45.036 --> 20:46.996
I think a date's better

20:45.036 --> 20:46.996
with just two people.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.956
Can we stop calling this a date?

20:48.998 --> 20:50.374
Well, whatever it is,

20:50.416 --> 20:52.501
I can't wait to see the look

20:50.416 --> 20:52.501
on my neighbor's face

20:52.543 --> 20:54.712
when I come strolling

20:52.543 --> 20:54.712
home after 11:00.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.548
Eat your heart out,

20:54.754 --> 20:57.548
Mrs. Klevesahl.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.299
I think I just missed my curfew.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.594
There are no curfews

20:59.341 --> 21:01.594
on a night like tonight.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.012
