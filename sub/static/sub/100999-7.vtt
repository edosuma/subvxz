WEBVTT

00:00.167 --> 00:02.542
Previously on Condor...

00:02.709 --> 00:05.709
Is he okay?
- Does he look okay?

00:05.851 --> 00:08.744
There may still be a problem. 
- Who? - Joe Turner.

00:08.769 --> 00:09.620
I'll handle it.

00:09.659 --> 00:10.768
No, if anything needs 
to be done, I'll do it.

00:10.792 --> 00:12.526
It's Tracy here. Leave a message.

00:12.526 --> 00:15.018
I've found the ambulance. I've got
the guy's address. I'm on my way there.

00:15.112 --> 00:16.890
What the fuck you doing here?

00:16.890 --> 00:18.934
'Cos of the Russians?
Are you guys working together?

00:18.959 --> 00:21.716
He is dead.
- We didn't kill him.

00:21.741 --> 00:24.139
We were going to make a...
With who? The Russians?

00:24.147 --> 00:26.881
The Russians?
We were working for the CIA!

00:28.534 --> 00:30.362
He and his crew were
contracted to kill Sirin.

00:30.362 --> 00:32.369
Not kill, kidnap. And he got away.

00:32.394 --> 00:34.018
So is Sirin alive?
- I think so.

00:34.713 --> 00:37.565
How many blown ops have
you been a part of recently?

00:37.596 --> 00:41.136
I'm impressed. Your little
speech brought Mr Crane to tears.

00:41.214 --> 00:42.747
Tracy's too close to the case.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.747
He tried to persuade me
Gordon was being set up

00:44.794 --> 00:46.752
by the Russians to
protect the real infiltrator.

00:46.776 --> 00:49.517
You and I should go away together.
- When?

00:49.568 --> 00:50.677
Right now.

00:50.797 --> 00:53.570
I'm thinking about getting out.
- Moscow may not allow it.

00:53.626 --> 00:55.125
Is that a threat?

00:55.299 --> 00:56.830
The Russians are cleaning
up after themselves.

00:56.877 --> 00:57.573
Cleaning up what?

00:57.597 --> 00:59.784
They set up Gordon to
protect their actual inside man.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.476
This whole fucking thing has
been one big active measure.

01:01.501 --> 01:04.315
If Sirin's alive, maybe he 
can tell you who the mole is.

01:04.315 --> 01:07.215
Too bad you didn't pick a place to meet
in the event things didn't go as planned.

01:08.042 --> 01:12.125
Joe? My name is Ekaterina.
We have a friend in common.

02:01.501 --> 02:03.959
Hurry up, it's freezing cold!

02:14.375 --> 02:20.250
Here. For the fire.
- You are a genius!

02:20.417 --> 02:23.834
Are you thirsty?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.959
To your good health.
- To your promotion.

02:30.375 --> 02:34.695
I was afraid
you'd be jealous.

02:34.918 --> 02:38.083
You were hoping to get the job yourself,
right?

02:39.792 --> 02:42.125
It had crossed my mind.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.083
But I'm happy for you.

02:45.459 --> 02:49.667
You know I'll always
take care of you.

02:56.250 --> 03:00.792
Then we'll also drink
to your good health.

03:00.959 --> 03:03.542
You're a good friend, Vasili.

03:11.167 --> 03:15.579
I checked. There's no Dale
Fridrych working for the CIMC.

03:15.604 --> 03:17.365
The Russians are cleaning
up after themselves.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.174
Cleaning up what?

03:19.250 --> 03:22.211
Gordon was set up to
protect their actual inside man.

03:22.211 --> 03:24.179
This whole fucking thing's
been one big active measure.

03:24.216 --> 03:26.211
If this is a
disinformation campaign

03:26.211 --> 03:29.185
You and Ms Larkin really stepped into it,
didn't you?

03:30.664 --> 03:32.751
What are you going to do now?

03:33.378 --> 03:35.925
If Sirin's alive and
you can find him

03:35.925 --> 03:38.125
maybe he can tell you
who the mole is.

03:38.918 --> 03:42.959
Too bad you didn't pick a place to meet
in the event things didn't go as planned.

03:43.125 --> 03:45.508
Trade craft one-oh-one.

03:45.508 --> 03:48.772
I'm not the only one who's
made an obvious mistake.

03:49.042 --> 03:53.334
Maybe you have a reason to
hang Gordon Piper out to dry.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.501
Have a good night...

06:34.292 --> 06:36.250
Joe?

06:36.425 --> 06:39.909
My name is Ekaterina but my
American friends call me Kat.

06:39.909 --> 06:41.791
We have a friend in common.

06:41.854 --> 06:43.526
Where's Vasili?
- He sent me.

06:43.526 --> 06:46.854
Keep moving so we don't
draw attention to ourselves.

06:53.709 --> 06:55.366
And who are you?

06:55.366 --> 06:57.768
Somebody who prefers to be
kept out of your Agency reports.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.792
I do not work for the Agency.

06:59.959 --> 07:04.217
Uh huh. I'm going to get back on this
train by the time it leaves the station.

07:04.217 --> 07:05.630
I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

07:05.669 --> 07:07.107
You're not going to take me to Vasili?

07:07.107 --> 07:09.341
I'm taking you to the end of track 11.
You can take yourself.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.560
He's your problem now.

07:10.584 --> 07:12.646
It was great to see you, Joe.

07:12.646 --> 07:15.446
80 Bowery Street,
Chevy Chase and Maryland.

07:16.167 --> 07:18.209
Take care of him.

07:27.292 --> 07:28.626
Hey, asshole!

08:33.458 --> 08:37.375
Where are you?
Never mind, I see you.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.501
Jump in.

09:10.834 --> 09:12.667
Where are we going?

09:14.042 --> 09:15.751
You can navigate.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.792
Who are we following?

09:25.626 --> 09:29.083
When we bumped into each other earlier
outside the deli -

09:29.250 --> 09:32.751
you said you were
going home to sleep.

09:34.250 --> 09:37.083
I decided
to take a walk.

09:37.250 --> 09:39.083
Alone?

09:39.250 --> 09:43.459
Is this an interrogation? Yes, alone.

09:44.959 --> 09:49.501
Just when I start liking you you
start behaving like an asshole.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.334
We're following Joe Turner.

09:55.375 --> 09:56.867
Who's he?

09:56.867 --> 09:59.018
He helped Vasili come
to the United States.

09:59.042 --> 10:02.334
Does he work for the CIA?
-It's unclear.

10:08.626 --> 10:12.667
How long have you been following him?
- Since late this afternoon.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.792
Where did he go?

10:14.959 --> 10:18.792
To a meeting at Union Station.

10:18.959 --> 10:22.417
With whom?
- I didn't see.

10:25.417 --> 10:29.042
I have a feeling
he's meeting Sirin.

10:29.209 --> 10:32.751
He'll lead us straight to him.

10:32.918 --> 10:34.667
Why did you call me?

10:34.834 --> 10:40.167
Turner was close to your home.
I needed assistance.

10:40.334 --> 10:44.000
You could have called the office.
They would have sent a team.

10:44.167 --> 10:47.834
Yes, I could have done that.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.209
But you like the idea of
me chasing my ex-boyfriend?

10:52.375 --> 10:55.375
I simply prefer your company.

10:55.501 --> 10:59.125
I want to get to know you even better.

10:59.292 --> 11:04.501
You can never really
know people's motives.

11:04.667 --> 11:08.459
You just have to decide
which ones to trust.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.501
Turn right up ahead.

11:31.250 --> 11:34.000
I feel like a teenager who
is sneaking out of the house.

11:34.167 --> 11:38.959
I guarantee you no teenager
ever left their mother a 'to do' list.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.477
When I was 13 
I ran away from home

11:41.477 --> 11:45.568
and I left a list for my mom telling
her when to feed my various pets.

11:45.593 --> 11:47.609
How many pets are we talking about here?

11:47.609 --> 11:51.859
A rabbit, a parakeet and an aquarium.

11:51.966 --> 11:56.758
I was a very responsible teenager.
- That's a lot of pets!

11:57.286 --> 11:59.501
I wanted to be a veterinarian.

12:00.709 --> 12:04.167
How come you decided to
become a people doctor instead?

12:06.542 --> 12:10.709
It is harder to see animals
in pain than it is people.

12:10.876 --> 12:13.834
That's cold!

12:14.000 --> 12:16.459
But true.

12:16.584 --> 12:20.876
You're sure the kids are okay with
you and me going away together?

12:21.042 --> 12:25.209
They really like you. And they love
spending time with their Grandma.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.804
Hey wait!
Stop, stop!

12:31.792 --> 12:35.659
What are husbands for if
not to take the trash out?

12:35.659 --> 12:37.620
Gordon's not here.

12:37.667 --> 12:43.375
Let me help you out...
- He had a work thing.

12:45.368 --> 12:47.789
I spoke with Senator Thrush today.
- Oh, really?

12:47.829 --> 12:50.925
Yeah. It felt really
good to talk to her.

12:50.925 --> 12:52.477
Thanks for the push.

12:52.501 --> 12:55.587
Of course. Where
are you two off to?

12:55.587 --> 12:57.961
He won't tell me.
It's a surprise.

12:58.284 --> 13:02.667
Well, that's nice.
Tracy's so good at surprises.

13:02.834 --> 13:05.885
All right, you're all set.
We should get going.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.218
See you later.
Yeah, see you soon...

13:08.736 --> 13:11.250
I should tell her the kind if
friend you really are, shouldn't I?

13:11.417 --> 13:15.584
Bye! Have fun, you two.
- Bye! Thank you.

13:45.607 --> 13:50.709
At first I imagined
it would be like this all the time.

13:50.876 --> 13:52.834
But it's mostly paperwork.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.876
What delusions did you have
when you decided to do this?

14:01.042 --> 14:03.667
Why are you asking?

14:03.834 --> 14:09.042
Excuse me, but didn't you just say
you wanted to get to know me better?

14:09.209 --> 14:13.125
That requires asking questions
and answering them.

14:15.709 --> 14:19.000
My father worked like yours
in the intelligence service.

14:19.167 --> 14:22.542
Have you read about me?
- I know everything about you.

14:23.876 --> 14:28.751
I met your father once.
He was a great man.

14:32.417 --> 14:38.918
He was a drunk who beat up
his wife and three daughters.

14:39.083 --> 14:43.584
You do not know everything.
You only know what you have read.

15:05.625 --> 15:08.046
What are you thinking about?
- Hm?

15:08.975 --> 15:11.756
Seemed like you went
somewhere there for a second.

15:11.781 --> 15:14.351
I'm back now.

15:15.005 --> 15:17.084
I had a good chat with your
mom while you were packing.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.544
Oh God! What did she say?

15:19.912 --> 15:23.630
She asked me if I was true blue

15:28.018 --> 15:31.323
I'm sorry. What did you say?

15:31.323 --> 15:34.111
I said I was where
you were concerned.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.501
That's so embarrassing.

15:36.848 --> 15:41.166
I get it. Her daughter's going off for the
weekend with some guy she doesn't know...

15:41.166 --> 15:42.766
I'd be nervous, too.

15:44.612 --> 15:46.874
You know, I'm a 
little bit nervous, myself.

15:47.070 --> 15:50.963
Really?
Why's that?

15:51.814 --> 15:54.125
Why? As far as I have no
idea where you're taking me

15:54.166 --> 15:57.994
Oh yeah? Does it scare you
not knowing where you're going?

15:58.135 --> 16:00.064
A little.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.738
Do it turn you on
to be in control?

16:03.738 --> 16:05.691
Do you get off on that?

16:08.250 --> 16:10.542
I...

16:10.709 --> 16:17.724
I like that you trust me to
be in control. I get off on that.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.367
Maybe you just like having secrets.

16:20.500 --> 16:25.292
No, no I'm done with secrets.
That's why we're going on here.

16:25.459 --> 16:30.209
You're really building up the suspense.
- You're going to love it. Trust me.

16:30.718 --> 16:34.542
I should call Joe and let him
know that we're going out of town.

16:34.709 --> 16:37.417
Yeah, go for it.

16:42.805 --> 16:44.711
Hey?
- How's it going?

16:44.736 --> 16:46.080
It's going.
How about you?

16:46.283 --> 16:49.017
Tracy and I are on our way
out of town for a few days.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.408
Oh, you guys are leaving town?
Where are you going?

16:51.525 --> 16:55.634
It's a surprise. But it's
just for a couple of days.

16:55.697 --> 16:58.853
And my mom is going to stay with
the boys. I just wanted you to know.

16:58.892 --> 17:03.181
Thanks. I'm on my way to see a
friend of mine visiting from Europe.

17:03.243 --> 17:05.914
He's actually a mutual
friend of mine and Tracy's.

17:05.984 --> 17:08.320
You guys have a
friend in common?

17:08.547 --> 17:12.088
Tell Tracy that
Basil is in town.

17:12.088 --> 17:15.031
Joe wants me to tell
you that Basil's in town.

17:16.041 --> 17:19.751
Basil? How is he?
Here, you're on speaker.

17:20.204 --> 17:23.674
I heard that Basil had a little accident.

17:23.699 --> 17:26.230
Yeah, he had a close call,
but he's okay.

17:26.261 --> 17:27.589
Please tell Basil that I said hi

17:27.627 --> 17:30.917
and I'd love to talk to
him if he's feeling up to it.

17:31.018 --> 17:32.375
I'll tell him that's
what you said.

17:32.776 --> 17:36.209
Hey, you're really stepping
on my surprise vacation here.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.834
Sorry.
- All right, Joe.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.083
Do you guys really have a friend
in common or was that about work?

17:49.667 --> 17:52.417
You know, never mind. 
I don't want to know.

18:04.924 --> 18:07.459
I'm going to pull over
for a bathroom break.

18:37.529 --> 18:40.417
Yeah?
- Hi, it's me.

18:40.542 --> 18:43.292
I think Joe Turner's on
his way to meet Vasili Sirin.

18:43.459 --> 18:47.417
I'm already on him.
- Okay. Good.

18:47.550 --> 18:50.550
I gotta go.
Happy hunting.

18:52.626 --> 18:55.792
Was that your source in the CIA?

18:57.709 --> 18:59.792
And.

18:59.959 --> 19:03.834
He must be good if he
already knows where Joe Turner is going.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.792
He is our most valuable asset.

19:06.959 --> 19:11.918
I would do basically
anything to protect him.

19:45.904 --> 19:48.513
What was that for?
- Luck.

20:10.860 --> 20:13.188
Why did you change your mind?

20:13.290 --> 20:15.422
I've been where you are.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.792
Stop!

20:36.792 --> 20:39.559
Wake up! Wake up!
Oh, shit!

20:39.584 --> 20:43.125
Wake up, Kathy! 
Damn it, wake up!

20:43.292 --> 20:48.292
Please, wake up! 
Please... wake up...!

20:56.687 --> 21:02.000
We're just taking a little detour. 
- Detour?

21:02.167 --> 21:03.876
I want to show you something.

21:25.158 --> 21:29.635
Here. Wrap yourself up in this.
It's brutal cold out here.

21:29.635 --> 21:31.799
Thank you.

21:37.876 --> 21:39.709
What's in the box?

21:45.194 --> 21:47.209
Is your secret that you're a nerd?

22:14.224 --> 22:16.248
Right. Take a look...

22:17.709 --> 22:22.375
What star is that?
- That... is my star.

22:24.222 --> 22:25.933
Really?
- Uh huh.

22:26.187 --> 22:31.709
I spent $33 online
and it's all mine.

22:36.365 --> 22:37.918
You have a star...

23:06.716 --> 23:08.876
Vasili means nothing to me.

23:09.918 --> 23:12.167
Maybe not.

23:12.334 --> 23:17.083
You never know why
people do what they do.

23:18.459 --> 23:23.501
Is this a test of
which of my lovers I am loyal to?

23:28.924 --> 23:30.579
He's turning off.

23:49.573 --> 23:51.284
He's stopped.

25:13.998 --> 25:17.709
Make a sound and
I'll cut your throat.

25:17.876 --> 25:21.375
How many are you?
- Just me.

25:24.501 --> 25:26.204
My friend!

25:26.266 --> 25:28.626
She found you.
- Yes.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.773
Where the fuck did they come from?
- They followed you.

26:03.809 --> 26:05.920
Yeah? Or maybe she betrayed you.

26:05.945 --> 26:08.382
No, she already 
knew where I was.

26:08.391 --> 26:10.718
She helped me at
great personal risk.

26:10.959 --> 26:14.568
We should get rid of this car.
There may be a tracker on it.

26:16.667 --> 26:21.584
You had him in sight.
- In that case, he would have been dead now.

26:21.751 --> 26:23.790
What about you and Vasili?
- He's a traitor.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.055
No, he's not.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.417
This is personal.

26:51.292 --> 26:54.959
When we were young,
I was always jealous of you.

26:55.125 --> 27:01.501
You had natural skill,
never had to work hard.

27:01.626 --> 27:07.550
I had a hard time learning.
- You struggled really hard.

27:09.751 --> 27:14.126
I had some luck too.

27:14.126 --> 27:16.926
You deserve everything
that came your way.

27:19.459 --> 27:23.940
If I were you...
I would have said exactly the same thing.

27:23.987 --> 27:29.459
But I wonder whose ass you
had to lick to end up my boss?"

27:29.584 --> 27:32.876
I didn't, I promise.

27:33.042 --> 27:37.042
I've been thinking for a long time
about saying one thing to you.

27:37.209 --> 27:42.209
I've always known
you're the smartest of us.

27:44.083 --> 27:50.000
Of course, you realize that in our business,
none of us know the details of

27:50.167 --> 27:53.584
what the other has achieved
in his professional life.

27:53.751 --> 27:58.204
I don't need details.
- But I want to tell you.

27:58.321 --> 28:03.542
I want my closest friend
to know why I'm where I am.

28:03.709 --> 28:08.169
Okay, whose ass did you lick?

28:09.667 --> 28:15.689
For the past twelve years
I've had a mole in the CIA.

28:29.690 --> 28:34.125
Tell me ... how you managed it.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.542
There is only one way
to reel in such a large fish.

28:42.709 --> 28:47.167
You have to catch it when
it is small and cultivate it.

28:47.334 --> 28:53.334
I threw bait at CIA offices
all over Europe for several years ...

28:54.626 --> 28:59.834
... while waiting for the right fish ...

29:00.000 --> 29:01.959
... to swim past.

29:20.542 --> 29:23.459
His name is Volk.

29:23.584 --> 29:28.209
Who is he?
- An old friend... from home.

29:28.375 --> 29:32.501
We came up in the SVR
together and we were like brothers.

29:33.055 --> 29:38.626
I used him in a moment of
weakness... drunkenness, really

29:39.221 --> 29:43.501
He bragged to me about an
asset he was running in the CIA.

29:43.667 --> 29:49.709
I betrayed his trust and used his
secret as leverage to earn my freedom.

29:49.876 --> 29:52.334
Now he wants to kill me.

29:53.876 --> 29:55.584
Who is the mole?

29:58.993 --> 30:00.868
That's still the only
leverage I have left.

30:00.893 --> 30:04.188
I think I've put my neck on the line far enough
for you by now to have earned your trust.

30:04.258 --> 30:08.828
This is not a matter of trust.
This is a matter of survival.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.209
This is a good place.
Pull over.

30:21.403 --> 30:27.125
When I was a kid... I saw
a meteor in the night sky.

30:27.721 --> 30:32.876
So, I calculated its arc
and went searching for it.

30:33.409 --> 30:39.417
I was completely obsessed with finding
this rock. It was totally irrational.

30:39.979 --> 30:43.745
I think I have been preoccupied
my whole adult life

30:43.799 --> 30:47.876
with some version of
that same obsession.

30:48.042 --> 30:54.375
Trying to enact some sort of mastery
over the vast, unknowable universe.

30:57.182 --> 30:59.417
It's a weakness. It's...

30:59.542 --> 31:04.125
...the drive of ego,
the urge for power...

31:06.216 --> 31:11.567
For 20 years I've been keeping secrets
from the people that I care about the most.

31:11.598 --> 31:14.342
doing things that
I'm not proud of.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.709
Been caught up in this...

31:18.876 --> 31:21.125
... stupid game.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.088
I don't want to
do that any more.

31:29.418 --> 31:31.011
I want to retire.

31:36.593 --> 31:38.667
And for years I...

31:40.258 --> 31:43.751
couldn't even see how that would
be possible, going out with you.

31:45.774 --> 31:47.584
When we are together...

31:48.959 --> 31:53.501
...I can finally this clear path
to our own little...

31:53.667 --> 31:56.667
...piece of happiness
in the world.

32:25.042 --> 32:26.501
Keys.

32:42.550 --> 32:45.633
Can I help you gentlemen?
- Hey...um...

32:46.334 --> 32:50.513
Our car just broke down a couple of
miles up the road and we were just...

32:52.918 --> 32:54.751
We will comply.

32:57.344 --> 33:01.417
Are you a couple of dope addicts?
- No, we're with the government.

33:01.875 --> 33:04.125
Oh, well then,
I trust you implicitly.

33:06.834 --> 33:08.417
Easy, easy..

33:08.542 --> 33:12.792
Are they on opioids?
- I don't know. Hard to tell.

33:12.959 --> 33:18.501
What are you two doing in our barn?
- We ... need your car.

33:20.501 --> 33:25.167
The cops are on their way.
- Get comfortable.

33:25.755 --> 33:29.068
Great.
In fact, yeah.

33:29.434 --> 33:32.000
We will just stand here
until the cops arrive.

33:48.334 --> 33:50.482
May I have a glass of water?

33:52.685 --> 33:55.248
You got balls, son,
I'll give you that.

33:55.248 --> 33:56.928
What are you, Russian?

34:13.476 --> 34:16.234
The cops are here.
- I just called 'em.

34:16.259 --> 34:17.313
Shit!

34:17.368 --> 34:21.757
Maybe a unit was already nearby.
- Way the hell out here?

34:21.856 --> 34:24.687
The tracker wasn't on your car.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.193
It's on you.
- Shit!

34:26.250 --> 34:28.500
Hold still.
- What?

34:30.125 --> 34:32.375
Stay on the fucking ground!
- I work for a federal agency!

34:32.375 --> 34:34.070
My name is Joe Turner.

34:36.958 --> 34:38.792
Are you really with the government?

34:38.966 --> 34:42.152
And I promise you, you do not want
us here when these people arrive.

34:42.513 --> 34:43.951
You will be witnesses.

34:44.873 --> 34:49.208
Please!
- It's that way...

34:49.375 --> 34:50.667
Thank you.

35:01.209 --> 35:05.193
Did you miss the sign out front?
The one that reads 'Private property'?

35:05.232 --> 35:08.959
Put your guns on the ground!
- It's okay.

35:12.583 --> 35:15.551
I'm Special Agent Dale
Fridrych. I'm with the FBI.

35:15.575 --> 35:17.958
Is it all right if I reach
for my credentials?

35:21.138 --> 35:22.373
Slower.

35:27.312 --> 35:29.390
Right, just give 'em a toss.

35:39.091 --> 35:41.388
We're looking for two dangerous men.

35:44.924 --> 35:47.870
I caught them in our barn.
I told 'em to fuck off.

35:48.861 --> 35:51.424
Did you see which
way they fucked off to?

36:41.110 --> 36:42.876
Come on.

36:43.042 --> 36:45.284
I can't...
- Go on...

36:45.284 --> 36:46.502
I don't think so.

36:47.501 --> 36:51.501
I would tell you to
go on without me.

36:53.125 --> 36:56.171
But please, do not...

37:04.015 --> 37:09.125
When we first got here, you asked me
what my plans were for the future.

37:09.292 --> 37:13.751
Yeah, you said you wanted to meet
a woman and start a small business.

37:14.238 --> 37:18.709
I already knew the woman.
- It's the woman who met me at the station.

37:19.245 --> 37:20.714
Yeah.

37:23.372 --> 37:30.676
I imagined us running away together
and making a life together.

37:31.209 --> 37:34.876
But she says
she no longer loves me.

37:35.285 --> 37:36.667
I'm sorry.

37:38.959 --> 37:41.501
I think she still loves me.

37:42.792 --> 37:44.959
But she's afraid.

37:46.677 --> 37:49.250
Good. Use that.

37:51.083 --> 37:53.334
It'll give you something to fight for.

38:28.250 --> 38:32.125
The forest is too big.
We need reinforcement.

38:45.209 --> 38:49.334
Ow! Poor crabs!
- Poor crabs? It's delicious crabs.

38:50.876 --> 38:56.058
Have you ever heard of 'crab mentality'?
- Nope.

38:56.598 --> 38:58.501
You catch a bunch of crabs
and put 'em in a bucket.

38:58.526 --> 39:01.599
They will sabotage each
other's attempts to escape.

39:01.859 --> 39:05.827
Why?  - They're like, 'fuck you, 
if I'm stuck here, so are you'.

39:06.694 --> 39:09.666
They just can't see that if
they all just stopped competing

39:09.666 --> 39:11.268
they would all eventually get out.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.447
So that's why we should eat them?

39:13.447 --> 39:15.948
'cos they're 'shellfish'?

39:22.177 --> 39:24.841
I beat you at your own game here.

39:25.751 --> 39:30.051
No, we eat them
because they're delicious

39:30.051 --> 39:32.810
and we all feel bad because
they're little assholes.

39:33.302 --> 39:35.876
Nice to see you, Tracy.
- Hey, Pete. How are you?

39:38.732 --> 39:40.302
You come here a lot?

39:42.224 --> 39:45.146
-I have a little
hideout in the area.

39:45.427 --> 39:47.474
Oh, you have a hideout?

39:48.409 --> 39:52.459
Does that make you a superhero?
Or a supervillain?

39:52.912 --> 39:55.294
It depends on whose version
of the story you believe.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.828
Am I going to get
to see this hideout?

40:05.776 --> 40:09.331
Where did you get your hideout?
Airb&b?

40:10.626 --> 40:15.459
No. Actually this is my house.

40:16.109 --> 40:17.542
What?

40:18.093 --> 40:19.686
Really?

40:21.250 --> 40:23.751
It's beautiful!

40:24.959 --> 40:27.232
Wait till you see the
view in the morning.

40:28.255 --> 40:30.459
How many times have you used that one?

40:32.377 --> 40:33.495
Never.

40:35.174 --> 40:36.918
Come on...

40:37.481 --> 40:40.292
You're the only person
I've ever brought up here.

40:40.873 --> 40:43.042
Not even Anders.

40:43.607 --> 40:46.501
Until now this place
has just been for me.

40:48.245 --> 40:50.104
You're sharing your secrets.

40:56.377 --> 40:58.190
Are there more?

41:28.180 --> 41:29.414
No...

41:30.703 --> 41:32.367
I need to rest.

41:45.359 --> 41:47.843
I need you to tell
me who the mole is.

41:50.766 --> 41:52.820
I think an innocent man is
going to take the fall for him

41:52.859 --> 41:54.662
which is at least
partly my fault.

41:54.694 --> 41:58.561
But if you tell me who it is,
then I can clear his name

42:01.661 --> 42:04.458
I would like to tell you who the mole is

42:06.122 --> 42:07.482
but I don't know.

42:10.439 --> 42:11.959
I bluffed.

42:12.509 --> 42:15.250
It was the only way
to save my own life.

42:16.904 --> 42:21.943
No. Volk is hunting you because
he told you the name of his asset.

42:21.990 --> 42:26.529
No. He's hunting me because
he knows he said too much.

42:27.876 --> 42:32.969
But he was so drunk he doesn't
remember exactly what it is he said to me.

42:38.780 --> 42:39.882
You lied to me.

42:40.046 --> 42:41.913
There really is a mole, Joe.

42:42.062 --> 42:44.185
And he really
did kill your uncle.

42:44.529 --> 42:49.209
I wasn't interested in avenging
the death of my uncle

42:49.560 --> 42:53.000
until you came to me
and asked for my help!

42:53.510 --> 42:57.596
I am only fucking here
here because you used me!

42:58.834 --> 43:01.373
I'm sorry, Joe.

43:15.334 --> 43:20.279
We should go. 
The hunters will be here soon.
