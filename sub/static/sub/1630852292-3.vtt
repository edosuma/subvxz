18:44.523 --> 18:47.159
[siren blows]

18:47.159 --> 18:48.727
[all cheering]

18:48.727 --> 18:50.796
[Melinda]As soon as we can see
that blue smoke,

18:50.796 --> 18:53.031
it's the best freakin' feeling
ever in the world.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.767
Win! Yes!

18:55.767 --> 18:57.336
[Melinda]
We just whooped y'all's asses,

18:57.336 --> 18:59.004
so we feel super good today.

18:59.004 --> 19:02.341
[all cheering]

19:02.341 --> 19:05.077
I am fucking jumping
out of my skin.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.279
That was a great
calculated move,

19:07.279 --> 19:09.281
stepping up
as team captain today.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.916
I am sh...
I am shaking.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.418
It does feel good to have
a lot of power,

19:13.418 --> 19:15.454
but I can't let it go
to my head.

19:15.454 --> 19:18.690
Heavy lies the crown,
you know what I'm saying?

19:20.792 --> 19:23.629
All right, everyone.
Great challenge today.

19:23.629 --> 19:24.930
Yeah!

19:24.930 --> 19:28.166
Very nice work, Black Team,
getting it done.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.468
[all applauding]

19:29.468 --> 19:31.036
[TJ]
As for the Green Team,

19:31.036 --> 19:32.738
unfortunately you came up
short today,

19:32.738 --> 19:36.508
therefore, Ryan, you're going
straight into the Arena.

19:37.476 --> 19:41.246
However,
Ayanna has the life shield,

19:41.246 --> 19:44.216
which means you are safe
from elimination,

19:44.216 --> 19:46.952
so we need a replacement
for you.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.056
Select one woman to send
into the elimination round,

19:51.056 --> 19:52.658
-losing squad.
-Oh.

19:53.559 --> 19:56.461
[Ayanna]
Look, look. I saved myself.

19:56.461 --> 19:58.463
Let's take it off
of everybody else.

19:58.463 --> 20:00.265
I choose who goes in.

20:00.265 --> 20:03.835
[tense music plays]

20:05.904 --> 20:08.073
Sophia, you go into elimination.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.108
It's a gift.

20:10.943 --> 20:14.580
If it's my time, it's my time,
what am I gonna do about it?

20:17.149 --> 20:18.817
You're not giving
that girl a fucking gift.

20:18.817 --> 20:22.421
A gift is a fucking croissant
or a spa gift card.

20:22.421 --> 20:23.889
That's not a goddamn gift.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.490
Let's go, let's give it up
for Sophia one time.

20:25.490 --> 20:26.925
Cool, that's what's up.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.360
Everybody good with that?
Everybody good with that?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.495
Everybody good
with that?

20:30.495 --> 20:33.198
Ayanna, once again
trying to make it about her.

20:33.198 --> 20:34.666
The pettiest shit
I've ever seen in my life.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.436
I swear to you,
I busted my ass for that team

20:37.436 --> 20:39.905
and the first chance you get
to throw your "friend"

20:39.905 --> 20:41.807
under the bus, you do.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.275
We're good.

20:44.142 --> 20:45.677
You guys chose Sophia.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.846
How did you come
to this decision?

20:48.213 --> 20:49.581
I own the decision.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.650
My choice for Sophia
was based on two things.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.720
Primarily, I don't trust her
at this point in the game.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.356
There has been inconsistency
with how she deals with me.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.825
Number two,
you're already mad at me

20:59.825 --> 21:01.860
so get ready
to be a little bit more mad.

21:01.860 --> 21:05.597
So she can push herself
to her limit or she can go home.

21:06.732 --> 21:10.168
I think Ayanna, 100%,
chose Sophia on personal reasons

21:10.168 --> 21:11.870
because of their argument.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.873
I don't think it had anything
to do with performance

21:14.873 --> 21:16.441
or the game.

21:16.441 --> 21:20.278
What was once like this powerful
and admirable woman

21:20.278 --> 21:22.848
is turning into an asshole.

21:22.848 --> 21:26.585
-Sophia, you all right
with this?
-I'm not afraid of elimination.

21:26.585 --> 21:27.919
It's part of the game.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.521
I'm gonna do my best
and try my hardest

21:29.521 --> 21:31.657
and hope that it works out
in my favor,

21:31.657 --> 21:34.259
but it is what it is, man.

21:34.259 --> 21:36.161
[all applauding]

21:36.161 --> 21:37.596
It is what it is.

21:37.596 --> 21:41.733
So, Ryan, Sophia,
I'll see you in the Arena.

21:41.733 --> 21:42.968
Right on.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.203
As for the winning team,
the Black Team,

21:45.203 --> 21:49.574
Darrell, Tina, as the
representatives of that team,

21:49.574 --> 21:51.009
you now have some power.

21:51.009 --> 21:53.512
I need you guys to go
back to the house,

21:53.512 --> 21:57.149
deliberate and nominate
four players,

21:57.149 --> 21:59.751
two of which will be selected
by the rest of the group

21:59.751 --> 22:04.156
to go against Ryan and Sophia
in the elimination round.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.592
Tina and I have never
really seen eye to eye,

22:07.592 --> 22:08.994
so I'm not feeling confident

22:08.994 --> 22:10.328
that Tina's gonna be
in my corner.

22:10.328 --> 22:11.863
I'm pretty sure I'm going in.

22:12.230 --> 22:14.066
[Nehemiah]I don't know
if I'm using my life shield yet.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.468
This is the first time that
it's ever been in play.

22:16.468 --> 22:18.103
Do I save one of these people

22:18.103 --> 22:19.938
where the other person
might get upset

22:19.938 --> 22:24.543
or do I just not use it
and upset everybody?

22:24.543 --> 22:26.144
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

22:26.144 --> 22:29.781
All right, I'll see you
at the Arena. Get out of here.

22:30.148 --> 22:33.018
Winning feels amazing.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.088
However, it also feels like shit

22:36.888 --> 22:39.791
because I'm gonna put myself
on people's radar

22:39.791 --> 22:41.927
and they're gonna think
that I'm targeting them.

support one another,

Lift everybody up.

Here's the question.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.842
Are you gonna ask Ryan
who he wants or...

23:30.842 --> 23:32.210
He doesn't,
he said he doesn't care.

23:32.210 --> 23:34.179
I think I'm gonna talk
to my whole team

23:34.179 --> 23:35.881
and I know, see, it's,
who is it on your squad?

23:35.881 --> 23:38.283
It's you, Steve, Cohutta.

23:38.283 --> 23:39.818
-[MJ] Teck.
-And Teck.

23:40.218 --> 23:42.521
Steve, I don't even know,
which is easy,

23:42.888 --> 23:46.057
and the rest, then that's when
it becomes a fuckin' pickle.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.459
I do not feel right

23:47.459 --> 23:49.294
by nominating anybody
in my room.

23:49.294 --> 23:51.963
We got Cohutta,
MJ and Jonna,

23:51.963 --> 23:53.498
but I can't make
too many promises

23:53.498 --> 23:55.233
'cause I don't like to make
promises I can't keep.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.135
I haven't talked to Tina yet,
but for some reason,

23:57.135 --> 23:59.371
if she wants to put one
of you guys' names in there,

23:59.371 --> 24:00.872
don't worry, Steve's going in.

24:00.872 --> 24:03.842
Darrell's plan
is to nominate Steve,

24:03.842 --> 24:06.745
which is great for me because
I'm not Steve, I'm Cohutta.

24:06.745 --> 24:10.415
So anything keeping Cohutta
out of the elimination.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.250
-Don't worry, I'll make sure.
-Right.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.119
Same with you, Jonna, 'cause
you're in the same fuckin' boat.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.420
[Jonna]
What?

24:15.420 --> 24:17.122
If your name is up there,
don't get mad.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.457
I mean, we can make sure
you got the numbers covered.

24:20.358 --> 24:23.662
Don't look... that look, boy,
that look is carving me up.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.865
I feel very safe going
into nominations

24:26.865 --> 24:28.266
because I have Darrell,

24:28.266 --> 24:29.868
my roommate
is gonna have my back,

24:29.868 --> 24:32.404
but you never really know
about Tina.

24:32.404 --> 24:35.173
Tina's kind of the wild card
in this.

24:37.809 --> 24:42.080
[tense music plays]

24:43.081 --> 24:44.382
[Tina]
Yeah! Yeah!

24:44.382 --> 24:46.017
[Darrell] Good job today,
by the way, Tina.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.586
[Tina]
Darrell, good job.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.054
[exhales]

24:49.054 --> 24:51.890
My suggestion, it wasn't
just you and I who won,

24:51.890 --> 24:54.259
I think we should have the
entire winning team immune

24:54.259 --> 24:55.727
at least from this elimination.

24:55.727 --> 24:57.195
I'm okay with that.

24:57.195 --> 24:58.663
Let's take down all the
names of the winners.

24:59.397 --> 25:02.033
I have a plan, it's fair,

25:02.033 --> 25:04.202
it'll make the least amount
of waves.

25:04.836 --> 25:08.807
Okay, I want to turn these
all over, shuffle 'em up,

25:08.807 --> 25:11.676
you turn around and you just
go one, two, three, four.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.779
[Darrell]
No, that's not how this works.

25:14.779 --> 25:16.548
I think you get to pick a guy's
name and a girl's name

25:16.548 --> 25:18.583
and I get to pick a guy's name
and a girl's name.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.118
Are you trying to save...

25:20.118 --> 25:22.287
Then I'm picking Steve.
How is Steve out the picture?

25:22.287 --> 25:24.289
I'm not doing it.
I'm not gonna put him up.

25:24.289 --> 25:26.424
But I feel like everybody
has more connections.

25:26.424 --> 25:28.793
I'm taking Steve off,
I'm not putting him in again.

25:28.793 --> 25:31.296
Oh, you are killing me.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.098
I ain't never been
this frustrated in my life, man.

25:33.098 --> 25:35.634
Working with Tina
is very draining.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.869
[Darrell]Tina says
I can't nominate Steve.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.739
Why? You barely know the dude.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.274
I'm picking Kendal.

25:43.441 --> 25:45.343
-[groans]
-[Tina] I'm picking Casey.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.080
-You need to fucking--
-I'm picking Cohutta.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.348
-You're taking off Cohutta.
-Yeah.

25:50.348 --> 25:52.417
Then those are the four,
that's it.

25:55.687 --> 25:58.490
[both sigh]

25:58.490 --> 26:00.358
The shit's gonna hit the fan.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.361
[Darrell] That's my whole
fuckin' room in there.

26:03.361 --> 26:05.030
[Tina]
I do have a history with Jodi.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.698
Back in the day on Inferno 2,

26:06.698 --> 26:09.668
I was on the Bad Asses team,
Jodi was one of the Good Guys.

26:09.668 --> 26:12.137
It's a sheisty-ass move
and it's a punk-ass move

26:12.137 --> 26:13.772
and y'all are little bitches,

26:13.772 --> 26:15.640
trying to do the,
pull this little sheisty move.

26:15.640 --> 26:16.808
That's what I think.

26:16.808 --> 26:19.477
Jodi was a great competitor.

26:19.477 --> 26:23.148
Nothing has changed
and I'm not targeting her,

26:23.148 --> 26:25.483
but it's the smartest move
to make.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.285
[Tina]
Oh, shit.

26:28.153 --> 26:29.688
Take a look at the names.

26:29.688 --> 26:30.755
[Nehemiah]
Whoa.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.324
[chuckles]

26:32.324 --> 26:34.426
We're basically
on different pages,

26:34.426 --> 26:36.227
and this is the best
we came up with.

26:36.227 --> 26:39.097
So if you wanna use your
life shield on one of those?

26:39.998 --> 26:41.499
So I have the life shield

26:41.499 --> 26:43.568
and I will be able to save
someone else.

26:47.872 --> 26:51.576
[Nehemiah]So I decided to save
Teck because I called him in,

26:51.576 --> 26:54.079
in the elimination last season
and I sent him home.

26:54.079 --> 26:55.547
This ends your time here
onThe Challenge.

26:55.547 --> 26:59.017
Hey, I'm glad it was you,
brother. My man.

26:59.017 --> 27:00.218
Love you, Teck.

27:00.585 --> 27:02.687
There's only one guy left.
Steve.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.089
Uh-uh, la-la-la-la-la.

27:04.089 --> 27:05.590
-Cohutta's up there, too.
-I just couldn't do it.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.192
We're gonna have to flip
a coin for this.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.627
That's the only fair way
for Cohutta and Steve.

27:10.829 --> 27:13.665
I'm gonna bury these
and you pick one out the sand.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.500
So whatever one you touch,
just pull up.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.902
Tina, just grab one.

27:17.902 --> 27:19.437
-Just grab one.
-This one.

27:22.874 --> 27:26.611
[tense music playing]

27:32.050 --> 27:34.619
-Wow.
-[Derrick K]
What, it's me and you?

27:35.820 --> 27:38.423
That's crazy.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.593
Yo, big dick energy,
Tina and Darrell.

27:41.593 --> 27:45.096
Only the second nomination and
you're throwing Jodi in there?

27:45.096 --> 27:47.365
That's a big move.

27:48.733 --> 27:50.268
Well, shit.

27:52.904 --> 27:54.973
-Country boys.
-Yeah.

27:54.973 --> 27:58.843
So Darrell made it very clear
to everybody in our room

27:58.843 --> 28:01.179
that he is not going
to put anybody in,

28:01.179 --> 28:06.017
and what do you know, Cohutta,
myself and Jonna are all in.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.286
What the heck's going on, bro?

28:09.354 --> 28:13.124
I think it would be more

I think being a good competitor,

can put you in the line of fire.

to choose from."

anyway.

in one of the challenges,

32:40.425 --> 32:42.493

who I'm throwing in

and exactly who I'm not saving

in the middle of the Arena,

34:55.159 --> 34:58.830
we have a big game board
with two giant tables

34:58.830 --> 35:01.499
and ten balls on them,
five for each of you.

35:01.499 --> 35:04.168
Tonight, you're gonna be playing
a good old-fashioned game

35:04.168 --> 35:05.803
of tic-tac-toe,

35:05.803 --> 35:09.340
only instead of Xs and Os,
you're gonna use your balls.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.776
Now to begin, you're gonna
start by your table,

35:11.776 --> 35:14.479
and when I say, "Go,"
you will race your ball

35:14.479 --> 35:17.482
over to the tic-tac-toe board
and place it on the board.

35:17.482 --> 35:20.051
The only thing
to make this game cooler...

35:20.718 --> 35:23.521
would be for those balls
to be on fire.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.958

-Hello!

we're gonna do.

on fire the entire time.

championships in Moscow '92.

36:44.769 --> 36:46.237

the totally wrong way

36:46.237 --> 36:47.672
to play tic-tac-toe

36:47.672 --> 36:53.277
but my goal would be center,
below center...

The one thing that you
can't do in this game

38:27.138 --> 38:31.642
is have a mental lapse.
Ryan blocked the wrong area.

he finally realizes it
