It's finally time for our full raid.

00:07.020 --> 00:10.750
And we're the first adventurers to ever come here.

00:10.750 --> 00:12.740
I love this tension.

00:13.030 --> 00:15.410
I-I'll do my best, too.

00:15.410 --> 00:16.850
Don't worry!

00:16.850 --> 00:18.330
It'll work out.

Okay, guys...

00:20.920 --> 00:22.280
Everyone ready?

00:23.470 --> 00:27.530
We're going to plant our flag in this raid zone!

01:58.300 --> 01:59.930
We let two of them through.

<i>If they go down, so does our whole plan.</i>

sacrificing yourself for me.

<i>And...</i>

05:27.300 --> 05:28.540
That's...

<i>Raid zones have anywhere from five to ten

<i>heavy healing, plus defense boosts

06:28.960 --> 06:31.340
<i>And their most important task is controlling aggro.</i>

We finally chipped off ten percent, huh?

07:21.660 --> 07:23.910

07:23.910 --> 07:25.360
One's on the platform below.

<i>We continued to fight Vendémiaire

08:58.880 --> 09:00.240
Damn it...

09:00.240 --> 09:02.140

<i>Raids are long fights. Some can

09:15.910 --> 09:17.030
<i>And...</i>

09:17.730 --> 09:19.200
It's the blink...

09:19.200 --> 09:21.260
After that, it disregards aggro,

09:21.260 --> 09:23.400
and uses that attack that inflicts

09:23.400 --> 09:25.940
negative status effects or insta-kill 
on ten people at random.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
We'll measure the intervals in the next fight.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.210
Sixty seconds.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.880
It's a sixty-second interval.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.510
One, two, three, four...

There's no flash this time!

10:05.210 --> 10:06.090
Okay!

10:06.090 --> 10:08.040

10:11.900 --> 10:13.920
Up the DPS!

10:14.630 --> 10:17.690
<i>If you can memorize every one of the

<i>If you defeat a raid boss, you can 
get a phantasm-level item.</i>

10:33.200 --> 10:35.190
<i>Then, we found the second raid boss,</i>

10:35.900 --> 10:37.950
<i>El Raida of the Fifth Prison.</i>

10:39.220 --> 10:40.980
<i>Though she was a tough opponent,</i>

10:40.980 --> 10:43.140
<i>with aggro resets and guardian beast summons...</i>

10:51.780 --> 10:55.080
<i>After a dozen or so tries, we beat her.</i>

10:56.850 --> 11:00.470
<i>You defeat each raid boss, one by one, 
and attempt to clear the dungeon.</i>

11:01.840 --> 11:04.120
<i>That is what a full raid is.</i>

11:13.000 --> 11:16.200
<i>It's been three weeks since we started the raid.</i>

11:17.250 --> 11:18.390

11:26.290 --> 11:28.120
Shut up, blabbermouth.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.170
I'm—

11:28.360 --> 11:30.850
Demi-Demi! Behind you!

11:32.380 --> 11:34.880
<i>Wyvern Kick!</i>

11:35.730 --> 11:38.050
His teamwork is a mess.

11:38.050 --> 11:39.840

11:44.230 --> 11:45.850
<i>As we get deeper in,</i>

11:46.440 --> 11:49.100
<i>we've really begun to understand

11:50.100 --> 11:53.240
<i>The monsters have leveled up,

12:01.880 --> 12:04.620
Sorry if you fall in love with me!

12:04.840 --> 12:06.620
Just shut up and do it!

12:07.960 --> 12:09.280
Here I go, then!

12:10.680 --> 12:14.330

12:26.110 --> 12:28.140
<i>Ever since we defeated the first two,</i>

12:28.810 --> 12:31.020
<i>we haven't encountered any raid bosses.</i>

12:31.020 --> 12:33.140
<i>And searching the dungeon 
is getting us nowhere.</i>

12:34.280 --> 12:37.150
<i>The battle had entered a stalemate.</i>

12:38.210 --> 12:40.210
How much do you think is left?

12:40.210 --> 12:41.870
How many raid bosses?

12:41.380 --> 12:45.650
<b>Abyssal Shaft — Safe Zone
Japan Server 
Beneath Tearstone Mountains
Dungeon/ No Monsters
PVP Permitted 
Skill Use Permitted 
Entry Restrictions/ None 
Exit Restrictions/ None</b>

12:41.870 --> 12:44.420
Three or four, probably.

12:44.420 --> 12:45.660
This isn't good...

12:46.110 --> 12:47.560
We can't last for ten days.

12:48.870 --> 12:52.160
<i>We're currently facing supply problems.</i>

12:53.060 --> 12:55.630
<i>During repeated battles, 
equipment gets damaged.</i>

12:56.550 --> 13:01.770
<i>To keep it in good shape, you need someone 
with crafter skills to do maintenance.</i>

13:04.060 --> 13:07.430
<i>William only has a limited 
supply of crystal comets.</i>

13:07.860 --> 13:12.200
<i>A high-level crafter had to use 
phantasm-level materials to make them.</i>

13:15.250 --> 13:17.090
Supplies, huh?

13:17.090 --> 13:19.280
Who knows how long our food will last?

13:19.280 --> 13:22.690
To attempt a full raid, you need good equipment.

13:23.030 --> 13:26.560
And the only real way to get it is during a raid.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.700
Same with crafting materials.

13:29.200 --> 13:35.220
Other raid guilds will do low-level 
raids simply for materials.

13:35.220 --> 13:39.710
Since the Apocalypse, it's been 
harder to visit a lot of raid zones.

13:39.710 --> 13:44.970
But we can't go through easy raids just for supplies.

13:45.260 --> 13:48.080
We aren't a weak guild like that.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.140
Our guild master doesn't like 
anything done halfway.

13:51.140 --> 13:51.970
Indeed.

13:52.660 --> 13:57.560
Isn't that why we followed him here?

13:58.860 --> 14:01.450
I have some materials I prepared.

14:01.450 --> 14:03.090
How long will they last?

14:03.770 --> 14:06.180
I'd guess twenty days total.

14:07.070 --> 14:08.270
Twenty days?

14:08.270 --> 14:10.110
That isn't much, is it?

14:10.110 --> 14:12.120
Y-Yeah...

14:12.390 --> 14:13.700
You're right.

14:13.700 --> 14:14.940
Yeah.

14:15.700 --> 14:16.750
<i>Seriously?</i>

14:17.280 --> 14:21.120
<i>Log Horizon is a small guild, 
with only eight members.</i>

14:21.640 --> 14:24.260
<i>How did he get all those materials?</i>

14:25.360 --> 14:27.770
<i>He's obviously no ordinary guy.</i>

14:30.180 --> 14:35.150
<i>After I left the Round Table and 
wandered to a bunch of raid zones,</i>

14:35.150 --> 14:36.790
<i>I ended up in Susukino.</i>

14:38.210 --> 14:41.310
<i>I don't regret my actions.</i>

14:42.630 --> 14:44.320
<i>I don't, but...</i>

14:47.860 --> 14:49.820
We're tired.

14:50.230 --> 14:51.400
Bye.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.420
It was fun, guild master.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.260
What are they planning to do?

14:56.260 --> 14:57.590
Weaklings.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.950
<i>And this time, I came to a place 
like this without even asking</i>

15:01.950 --> 15:03.790
<i>what Shiroe was after.</i>

15:06.120 --> 15:07.810
<i>And they believe in me.</i>

15:10.760 --> 15:13.040
<i>I don't know what's right.</i>

15:13.670 --> 15:15.640
<i>Or what I should say to them.</i>

15:17.100 --> 15:19.300
<i>I'm no more than a gamer.</i>

15:19.620 --> 15:23.550
<i>Games are the only thing I've ever 
taken seriously in my life.</i>

15:24.420 --> 15:25.370
<i>But...</i>

15:27.210 --> 15:30.010
<i>What do you think, Shiroe?</i>

15:30.480 --> 15:34.490
<b>No Goofing Off!</b>

15:31.320 --> 15:34.490
<i>It's convenient that we can go underground.</i>

15:35.560 --> 15:38.750
<i>But they aren't people we can keep 
fooling forever with tricks like that.</i>

15:40.590 --> 15:43.750
<i>Maybe Minami, but not them.</i>

15:46.560 --> 15:48.240
That bastard!

15:48.840 --> 15:50.800
That bastard!

15:53.350 --> 15:54.930
<i>Shiroe...</i>

15:56.010 --> 15:58.530
<i>I can take the cat-head and the guardian.</i>

15:58.530 --> 16:00.850
<i>They fought with their own power.</i>

16:01.730 --> 16:03.130
<i>But he...</i>

16:06.160 --> 16:09.380
<i>He just lurked in the back and issued orders,</i>

16:10.280 --> 16:11.610
<i>and even worse, he...</i>

16:14.150 --> 16:16.240
Which of you is Brigandia's Demi-glace?

16:16.770 --> 16:19.290
Mister, uh... Delicious?

16:24.020 --> 16:26.800
<i>It was an enchanter skill 
that gave me that buff.</i>

16:26.960 --> 16:28.090
<b>Physical Damage Increased 
Brigandia</b>

16:28.900 --> 16:30.880
<i>He used Keen Edge to buff me,</i>

16:30.880 --> 16:33.750
<i>and Mind Shock to stun the enemy for a moment.</i>

16:35.250 --> 16:38.310
That bastard saved me?

16:39.390 --> 16:41.810
Saved<i> me</i>?!

16:47.020 --> 16:50.830
Maybe he discovered I gave him extra veggies?

16:50.830 --> 16:52.570
I don't think that's it.

16:53.590 --> 16:55.290
What a problem he is...

16:55.290 --> 16:56.580
You said it.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.580
But...

16:57.810 --> 17:01.330
Yeah. If nothing else, he's no coward.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.830
Check out this stew!

17:05.090 --> 17:07.160
Let's eat!

17:11.270 --> 17:12.300
Chomp!

17:15.430 --> 17:17.510
Isn't this great, Naotsugu?

17:18.780 --> 17:20.210
What's wrong?

17:21.870 --> 17:24.510
It seems like Shiro isn't doing so well.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.860
Does it?

17:25.860 --> 17:29.070
He's always busy, and he always looks upset.

17:31.340 --> 17:35.740
But he's actually enjoying 
himself, and taking it easy.

17:36.670 --> 17:39.340
But since he's always that way,

17:39.340 --> 17:42.620
he can't tell when he's really suffering.

17:43.380 --> 17:46.120
And is he really suffering now?

17:47.240 --> 17:47.940
Yeah.

17:48.310 --> 17:50.530
Then he needs an idol.

17:50.530 --> 17:52.460
I think he's got one.

17:52.730 --> 17:54.520
Should I show him my panties?

17:54.860 --> 17:56.550
Listen, pan—

17:58.120 --> 17:59.970
A-Akatsuki's curse again!

18:01.600 --> 18:04.810
I don't think he needs that, either.

18:04.810 --> 18:09.230
But if he's suffering that much, 
what's he doing in a hole like this?

18:10.450 --> 18:11.620
Why, indeed...

18:15.260 --> 18:16.490
This is just a guess,

18:16.490 --> 18:18.390
but it might be to protect his home.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.030
His home?

18:20.030 --> 18:22.370
Not like an actual building.

18:22.370 --> 18:25.370
By his home, I mean... His guild? His town?

18:25.370 --> 18:26.970
No, the world?

18:26.970 --> 18:28.070
The world?

18:28.070 --> 18:30.380
A human needs a home, 
and a place to eat, right?

18:30.700 --> 18:32.120
And companions.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.280
In our old world, that would be family.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.990
In this world, that'd be our guild, right?

18:38.720 --> 18:42.950
And something like that needs a place to belong.

18:43.770 --> 18:47.140
His home's home would be... 
Akihabara, in other words.

18:48.100 --> 18:53.150
If the town isn't happy, the many 
guilds there can't be happy.

18:53.790 --> 18:57.280
And the people in those guilds 
would have to be sad.

18:58.360 --> 19:05.110
Shiro would fight a whole town, or a 
whole world, to protect his home.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.620
His home?

19:08.620 --> 19:09.730
Akihabara, huh?

19:11.070 --> 19:13.420
<i>It's about time to talk to Marie...</i>

19:14.020 --> 19:17.230
<i>No, I guess it isn't quite time yet.</i>

19:17.230 --> 19:19.950
<i>No, but I can't...</i>

19:21.340 --> 19:23.690
What's wrong, Naotsugu?

19:24.430 --> 19:26.010
N-Nothing!

19:26.010 --> 19:27.640
Nothing at all!

19:27.640 --> 19:29.860
Absolutely nothing whatsoever!

19:34.610 --> 19:38.640
Is "Christmas" different from "Snowfell"?

19:38.640 --> 19:41.510
Isn't that the People of the Land's winter festival?

19:41.510 --> 19:42.450
That's right.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.450
Do you think Shiroe will make 
it back in time for Christmas?

19:46.450 --> 19:48.620
Christmas, huh?

19:49.770 --> 19:52.460
Right about now, the old world must be...

19:55.510 --> 19:57.450
What's wrong, Katsuo?

19:58.480 --> 20:03.610
I-I've never spent Christmas with 
anyone except my family.

20:03.610 --> 20:05.360
I... I...

20:05.360 --> 20:06.750
Don't say anymore.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.480
This year, we're all together.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.190
Santa Claus?

20:13.190 --> 20:16.160
During Snowfell, people exchange presents.

20:16.160 --> 20:19.490
Christmas is when Santa hands out presents.

20:19.810 --> 20:20.530
Yeah.

20:20.530 --> 20:21.960
He rides a reindeer.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.310
No, he rides a sleigh, actually.

20:24.810 --> 20:26.290
Presents, huh?

20:26.290 --> 20:28.100
I wonder what he'll give us.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.500
I want the Teachings.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.000
If there were a scroll of the Teachings, 
I would definitely want it.

20:32.870 --> 20:34.460
What's that about the Teachings?

20:35.320 --> 20:36.540
Akatsuki?

20:36.540 --> 20:37.670
When did you get here?

20:37.670 --> 20:39.380
That's our mysterious ninja!

20:39.740 --> 20:41.880
Welcome back, Akatsuki!

20:42.110 --> 20:43.480
Y-Yeah.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.990
Thanks for the hard work.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.590
How about some tea and snacks?

20:48.590 --> 20:49.890
Thank you.

20:50.170 --> 20:52.580
Hey, what are the Teachings?

20:52.580 --> 20:54.120
You don't know?

20:54.120 --> 20:55.650
The whole town's been talking about it.

20:55.650 --> 20:58.220
I've heard of them, too.

20:58.220 --> 21:01.910
Basically, it's a new rank for skills.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.250
The same skill can be more or less powerful,

21:05.250 --> 21:08.030
depending on who's using it, yes?

21:08.310 --> 21:10.660
Because their rank is different, right?

21:10.970 --> 21:13.750
Correct. The same skill can have four ranks—

21:11.850 --> 21:20.410
<b>Fatal Flash/Assassinate</b>

21:13.350 --> 21:20.410
<b>Adept 

Basic</b>

21:13.750 --> 21:16.470
Basic, Adept, Hidden, and Secret—

21:14.520 --> 21:20.410
<b>Secret 

Hidden</b>

21:16.470 --> 21:20.420
with each more powerful than the last.

21:20.850 --> 21:25.730
For "Adept," you need a scroll made by 
an adventurer in the same job class.

21:25.730 --> 21:30.750
For "Hidden," you need a scroll made 
with rare materials, right?

21:31.260 --> 21:34.820
Both can be purchased, though at a high price.

21:34.820 --> 21:39.180
But "Secret" requires one to clear a special quest.

21:39.180 --> 21:42.440
You have to participate in a raid.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.680
A raid...

21:45.390 --> 21:49.260
And the "Teachings" are a level above that.

21:49.260 --> 21:51.170
But isn't it just a rumor?

21:51.170 --> 21:56.960
It seems very few people have 
actually acquired or seen one.

21:57.510 --> 21:59.640
Shiroe said they're real.

22:00.210 --> 22:01.460
Shiroe did?

22:01.460 --> 22:04.300
Yeah, he says they exist.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.750
We'd also like to earn them, right?

22:08.560 --> 22:12.550
<i>A special rank for skills, one that 
didn't exist when this was a game...</i>

22:13.150 --> 22:14.160
<i>The Teachings.</i>

22:14.980 --> 22:15.910
Come on in!

22:14.980 --> 22:16.420
How about it?

22:14.980 --> 22:17.980
<b>Let's Eat Bird! 
6 Days Until Christmas! 

Bird Is Yummy</b>

22:15.910 --> 22:17.980
Six days until Christmas!

22:16.420 --> 22:17.980
It's almost Christmas!

22:18.840 --> 22:22.480
What frivolous, weak fools...

22:23.710 --> 22:26.990
We are not your dogs.

22:27.910 --> 22:32.070
Don't get cocky, lowly adventurers.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.390
"I want to become strong."

24:07.810 --> 24:11.510
In Akihabara, Akatsuki is uncertain 
and alone without Shiroe.

24:11.510 --> 24:14.100
Why did Shiroe leave her?

24:14.100 --> 24:15.810
Why is she weak?

24:16.120 --> 24:19.480
And Lenessia has given up, as well.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.820
She believes adventurers and People of the 
Land cannot understand each other.

24:22.980 --> 24:29.940
<b>Shattered Wings</b>

24:23.170 --> 24:25.300
Next time: Shattered Wings.

24:25.740 --> 24:27.580
Rise up once more.
