WEBVTT

00:03.517 --> 00:06.980
George Sr. Had come
to a political fund-raiser

00:07.022 --> 00:09.774
to get support
for a wall project...

00:09.816 --> 00:11.651
To separate
the U.S. And Mexico.

00:11.693 --> 00:13.320
that some
considered insensitive...

00:13.362 --> 00:15.155
- Which was my idea!
- Was your idea.

00:15.197 --> 00:17.991
- ... even though he himself...
- Oh. Tender.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.993
was feeling more sensitive
by the day.

00:20.035 --> 00:21.495
Curious feeling.

00:21.536 --> 00:23.663
But he tried to muster
the old self-confidence

00:23.705 --> 00:25.499
for his face time
with Herbert Love.

00:25.540 --> 00:28.043
And I-I just think
there will be a lot of support

00:28.084 --> 00:30.920
flowing in this relationship,
and your base...

00:30.962 --> 00:32.714
You got a point
behind all those teeth of yours?

00:32.755 --> 00:34.466
If you support the wall,

00:34.508 --> 00:36.009
I'll give you
a piece of the action.

00:36.051 --> 00:38.011
- Action? Action Jackson?
- Yeah.

00:38.053 --> 00:40.180
- Yes, sir.
- What do I look like, Carl Weathers to you?

00:40.222 --> 00:42.516
- Oh, no, no.
- Not at all.

00:42.556 --> 00:44.558
- No.
- This, of course, is Herbert Love.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.977
My name is Herbert Love,
and I want you

00:46.019 --> 00:47.562
to say "high-low"
to my low-high plan.

00:47.603 --> 00:49.356
A candidate
whose campaign slogan

00:49.398 --> 00:52.692
was embraced by everyone
from the very wealthy...

00:52.734 --> 00:54.277
And who doesn't want
a high income?

00:54.319 --> 00:56.530
to their bankers
and tax attorneys.

00:56.571 --> 00:59.449
High-low, high-low,
it's off to work I go--for you.

00:59.491 --> 01:00.575
My name is Herbert Love,

01:00.616 --> 01:02.744
and I most definitely
approve this message.

01:02.785 --> 01:05.914
Do I look like someone
who eats at CW Swappigans?

01:05.955 --> 01:07.332
See, I stand for three things:

01:07.374 --> 01:09.959
one, getting
Barack Hussein Obama

01:10.001 --> 01:13.046
Wama Comma Mama on a Llama
out of office...

01:13.088 --> 01:15.340
It's a crazy-town name.

01:15.382 --> 01:17.050
Two, low taxes
for high income earners.

01:17.092 --> 01:18.218
That's my low-high plan.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.512
- I know it.
- And three,

01:20.554 --> 01:22.347
getting a little something
in my slushie fund

01:22.389 --> 01:23.932
so that I'm nice and loose

01:23.973 --> 01:25.808
and can help make
numbers one and two happen.

01:25.850 --> 01:28.602
I don't want to be the one to
say it, but I happen to be fond

01:28.644 --> 01:30.688
of redheads and greenbacks.

01:30.730 --> 01:32.274
- George Sr. Had neither.
- Oh, I-I...

01:32.315 --> 01:34.067
- How would you like both?
- Get it for me tonight,

01:34.109 --> 01:35.485
and I'll make your wall thing

01:35.527 --> 01:36.986
the third point
of my three-point plan.

01:37.028 --> 01:38.738
All I got right now is:
"You want to reach

01:38.780 --> 01:41.491
"your hand into my pocket
to pay for your birth control?

01:41.533 --> 01:44.536
I get to put my hand
in your pocket to put it in."

01:44.578 --> 01:46.580
But when unveiled it
in Garden Grove,

01:46.621 --> 01:48.831
I had to duck a
woman's pump and a mini pizza.

01:48.873 --> 01:50.666
Oops.

01:50.708 --> 01:52.210
Coming up with money, however,

01:52.252 --> 01:54.129
would be difficult
for George Sr.,

01:54.170 --> 01:56.714
who hadn't been acting
like his old self--

01:56.756 --> 01:58.091
something his twin brother
Oscar had done

01:58.133 --> 02:00.510
- You know, the wall.
- much more successfully

02:00.552 --> 02:02.011
earlier that day,
when, in retribution...

02:02.053 --> 02:03.472
Have you baked your brain
in that pizza oven?

02:03.513 --> 02:05.140
to a brother
who lied to him...

02:05.181 --> 02:06.391
So he only did buy that land
for personal gain.

02:06.433 --> 02:08.268
Well... Oscar.

02:08.310 --> 02:09.990
- Oscar.
- ... Oscar chose to lie

02:10.019 --> 02:12.647
- with George's wife.
- Call me Father B.

02:12.688 --> 02:16.610
And, although too explicit
for an American audience,

02:16.651 --> 02:19.529
the lovemaking was intense
and beautiful

02:19.571 --> 02:21.490
but for one small
misunderstanding

02:21.531 --> 02:24.367
that occurred
during the afterglow.

02:25.494 --> 02:27.203
No. I-I mean...

02:27.245 --> 02:28.788
it's good to be out of that

02:28.830 --> 02:30.499
sweaty old hot box
at the compound.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.834
No, this was am...
this was amazing.

02:32.875 --> 02:34.503
And Oscar finally got
more information

02:34.544 --> 02:36.129
- Speaking of that...
- about his brother's plans.

02:36.171 --> 02:39.048
we may need to have
a president ready to go

02:39.090 --> 02:41.050
if something should happen
to Lucille 2

02:41.092 --> 02:42.802
while we're building the wall.

02:42.844 --> 02:44.720
So we are building a wall.

02:44.762 --> 02:46.264
Right where Oscar

02:46.306 --> 02:48.558
thought he would be spending
the rest of his life.

02:50.185 --> 02:52.562
Turn him around three times
and put him in Fullerton,

02:52.604 --> 02:54.230
- he won't know the difference.
- Fullerton.

02:54.272 --> 02:57.900
You know, I think we should
send our son down there.

02:57.942 --> 03:00.945
Give him some training,
show that he has a job,

03:00.987 --> 03:02.155
let him sweat a little.

03:02.197 --> 03:03.281
Buster? No, no.

03:03.323 --> 03:04.658
I won't... I won't hear of it.

03:04.698 --> 03:05.908
It could kill him.

03:05.950 --> 03:07.536
I meant Gob.

03:07.577 --> 03:09.037
Oh. Oh, fine.

03:09.078 --> 03:11.705
Yeah, send him down.
I love that.

03:11.747 --> 03:13.416
Now the story of a family

03:13.458 --> 03:16.002
whose future
was abruptly canceled

03:16.044 --> 03:18.254
and the one father
who had no choice

03:18.296 --> 03:20.549
but to keep himself together.

03:23.635 --> 03:26.638
It's George Sr.'s...

03:29.224 --> 03:32.602
Unaware that he was being
cuckolded by his brother,

03:32.644 --> 03:34.020
George Sr. Was struggling

03:34.062 --> 03:36.439
to find money
to bribe Herbert Love.

03:36.481 --> 03:37.815
Didn't someone die
in one of these things?

03:37.857 --> 03:39.526
Oh, no, not in one of ours.

03:39.568 --> 03:41.903
Although his pitch had lost
some of its luster.

03:41.944 --> 03:44.864
And, you know, I mean, it's
better than dying in the snow.

03:44.906 --> 03:47.576
I mean, not...
not-not that you'll die,

03:47.617 --> 03:50.537
but if you had to choose,
uh, I mean...

03:50.579 --> 03:52.497
- Brr, you know?
- Hmm.

03:52.539 --> 03:54.249
Well, I'll think about it.

03:54.290 --> 03:55.917
Would you like a mini-quiche?

03:55.958 --> 03:57.586
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:57.627 --> 04:01.130
I thought you were a successful
Republican strategist.

04:01.172 --> 04:03.299
- I'm so sorry.
- Why, 'cause I'm black?

04:03.341 --> 04:04.926
Oh, no...

04:04.967 --> 04:06.844
It was over.

04:06.886 --> 04:09.097
But at least
he could go home...

04:09.138 --> 04:10.473
Cindy's going to love these.

04:10.515 --> 04:12.267
Excuse me, Red,
you're not the only one

04:12.308 --> 04:14.644
- who likes coconut shrimp.
- ... with some coconut shrimp.

04:14.686 --> 04:16.271
Well, I should have
known you'd be here,

04:16.312 --> 04:19.065
supporting this right-wing,
dangerous crackpot.

04:19.107 --> 04:22.402
Lindsay, I forgot--
you dyed your hair.

04:22.444 --> 04:24.362
What are you doing here?

04:24.404 --> 04:25.988
I'm supporting Love, as well.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.699
We're both doing that.

04:27.741 --> 04:30.034
Oh, honey, I-I've wanted
to contact you

04:30.076 --> 04:32.912
every single day since last May.

04:32.954 --> 04:34.956
I haven't seen you
since January.

04:34.997 --> 04:38.460
Yeah, the first four months,
I was in denial. How are you?

04:38.501 --> 04:39.794
Are... are you good?

04:39.835 --> 04:41.588
Do you have any money?

04:41.630 --> 04:43.256
Not really.

04:43.298 --> 04:44.799
- Oh.
- Oh, except for

04:44.840 --> 04:46.676
a $50, 000 check

04:46.718 --> 04:49.554
your wife sent to my daughter
for plastic surgery.

04:49.596 --> 04:52.056
What kind of a woman does that?

04:52.098 --> 04:54.309
I thought there
was no money left.

04:54.350 --> 04:55.602
Oh, no. Oh, no.

04:55.644 --> 04:57.103
Oh, that's awful.

04:57.145 --> 04:59.272
I mean, she's just precious
the way she is.

04:59.314 --> 05:01.441
Does Maisie even know
about this?

05:01.483 --> 05:02.692
No, thank God.

05:02.734 --> 05:04.360
And her name is Maeby.

05:04.402 --> 05:06.904
You don't think Maisie's cuter?

05:06.946 --> 05:09.574
You know what I want to do?
I want to take this,

05:09.616 --> 05:12.452
and I want to deposit it
in a trust fund

05:12.494 --> 05:16.247
that she can't open
until she's 21.

05:16.289 --> 05:19.208
- I guess I can't use it anyway.
- Are you kidding me?

05:19.250 --> 05:22.878
You are the most beautiful
little girl I know.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.130
And if you have any more work,

05:24.172 --> 05:25.465
your cartilage
is going to collapse.

05:25.507 --> 05:26.924
Let me see if I can...

05:26.966 --> 05:28.718
- There you go.
- And that's when

05:28.760 --> 05:31.179
George Sr. Finally tipped
a black man.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.305
- Got the check.
- ... okay?

05:32.347 --> 05:33.306
Ooh! Hey, you got the check.

05:33.348 --> 05:34.349
Third party.

05:34.390 --> 05:36.058
Oh, man.

05:36.100 --> 05:40.271
- I am going to put this on my wall.
- Oh...

05:40.313 --> 05:43.107
George Sr.
left the hotelhoping he'd

05:43.149 --> 05:47.153
accomplished something.

05:47.195 --> 05:49.238
And on the news the next day...

05:49.280 --> 05:50.782
We have got...

05:50.824 --> 05:54.994
to build a wall
between us and Mexico.

05:55.036 --> 05:56.621
he found out he had.

05:56.663 --> 05:58.373
- Yes!
- And aside from hating

05:58.414 --> 06:00.625
the wrinkles he saw
in the rearview mirror

06:00.667 --> 06:04.462
around his eyes and brow,
George Sr. Was happy.

06:04.504 --> 06:06.840
♪ All you need is smiles ♪

06:08.591 --> 06:11.093
♪ Lots and lots
of smiley smiles ♪

06:11.135 --> 06:12.345
♪ All you need is... ♪

06:12.387 --> 06:15.473
What the (bleep)
is he smiling about?

06:15.515 --> 06:17.016
Hello!

06:17.058 --> 06:18.727
Oh, we're just doing a survey

06:18.768 --> 06:20.019
for the U.S. Government, ma'am.

06:20.061 --> 06:22.313
Oh, no, I-I'm a man.

06:22.355 --> 06:24.982
I was just wearing,
uh, this blouse

06:25.024 --> 06:27.861
because I was, uh, driving
and I hate my arms.

06:27.901 --> 06:29.278
What's the tape for?

06:29.320 --> 06:30.739
Laying out border coordinates

06:30.780 --> 06:32.407
for when they put up the wall.

06:32.448 --> 06:34.784
Shh! You're not supposed
to tell them what it's for.

06:34.826 --> 06:36.327
Well, he already
mentioned the tape,

06:36.369 --> 06:37.620
and he looks American.

06:37.662 --> 06:39.664
- Yeah, but he's in Mexico.
- Wait.

06:39.706 --> 06:41.457
Guys, no, no, Mexico starts

06:41.499 --> 06:43.376
- back there, by the gully.
- Whoever told you that's

06:43.418 --> 06:45.461
probably chomping on the maca,
if you know what I mean.

06:45.503 --> 06:47.004
So, what you're saying
to me is that

06:47.046 --> 06:49.591
on this side of the tape,
I'm in Mexico,

06:49.632 --> 06:51.342
but when I come over here...

06:51.384 --> 06:53.762
Whoa. We're going to need
to see a passport, sir.

06:53.803 --> 06:55.680
Pasaporte.

06:55.722 --> 06:57.682
George Sr.
liked to make men

06:57.724 --> 06:59.975
who disappoint him suffer.

07:00.017 --> 07:01.728
But things change.

07:01.770 --> 07:04.188
You really hurt
my feelings, guys.

07:04.230 --> 07:06.816
- No hugging... ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.155
George Sr.
had just discovered

07:13.197 --> 07:15.366
that the millions of dollars
of American property

07:15.408 --> 07:17.744
he owned was worthless.

07:17.786 --> 07:19.120
How did you not notice?

07:19.161 --> 07:20.622
You saw all the papers.

07:20.663 --> 07:22.248
And in Mexico.

07:22.290 --> 07:24.793
You can't expect me to read
every page of that deal.

07:24.834 --> 07:26.554
Besides, that one
was particularly difficult

07:26.586 --> 07:28.296
because it was all in Spanish.

07:28.337 --> 07:30.423
It says very clearly,
on my business card,

07:30.465 --> 07:32.842
"Se habla español."

07:32.884 --> 07:34.343
"I do not speak Spanish."

07:34.385 --> 07:35.545
And it was your brother Oscar

07:35.553 --> 07:37.263
who told me it
was on the border.

07:37.305 --> 07:38.932
How did he not know?

07:38.973 --> 07:41.100
Unfortunately,
Oscar missed the signs.

07:41.142 --> 07:43.102
You think it's okay
to burn these?

07:43.144 --> 07:44.479
Well, this is America.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.230
If they don't want us
to burn signs,

07:46.272 --> 07:48.274
they shouldn't write them
in Spanish.

07:48.316 --> 07:52.194
- Everybody!
- ♪ Sign, sign, everywhere a sign... ♪

07:52.236 --> 07:54.363
Only Heartfire knew the truth.

07:54.405 --> 07:58.200
But the singing was so loud,
no one could hear her thoughts.

07:58.242 --> 08:00.286
I bribed Love

08:00.328 --> 08:02.580
to push for the building
of the wall,

08:02.622 --> 08:04.540
and I don't have the land
to build it on!

08:04.582 --> 08:06.334
Shh, shh, shh.
Call Herbert Love, all right?

08:06.375 --> 08:08.336
Tell him you would
greatly appreciate it

08:08.377 --> 08:10.922
if he'd rescind his support
for the wall.

08:10.964 --> 08:13.007
And make him a flip-flopper?
I can't do that.

08:13.048 --> 08:14.467
Actually, he'd tried,

08:14.509 --> 08:16.051
but couldn't afford it.

08:16.093 --> 08:18.220
It's a 40 for the flip
and a 40 for the flop,

08:18.262 --> 08:20.974
and since it's going to cause
a flap, I'd say another 40.

08:21.015 --> 08:24.686
So it's a flat 40-40-40
flip-flop and a flap fee.

08:24.727 --> 08:27.396
Well, then find someone
who has influence with him.

08:27.438 --> 08:28.940
Hold on.
A client is, uh, coming,

08:28.982 --> 08:30.483
and I don't know where Oscar is.

08:30.525 --> 08:31.734
He's disappeared.

08:31.776 --> 08:33.820
And there is something up
with him

08:33.861 --> 08:35.905
because he is scary now.

08:35.947 --> 08:37.155
He has changed.

08:37.198 --> 08:39.033
Hey, you've changed,
you big (bleep).

08:39.073 --> 08:40.702
You're acting
like a little girl lately.

08:40.743 --> 08:41.995
And not in the good way.

08:42.035 --> 08:43.556
Pull yourself together.
Act like a man.

08:43.578 --> 08:44.998
You're right, you're right.

08:45.039 --> 08:48.001
- Okay, love you.
- Love you, too. Bye.

08:48.042 --> 08:49.627
Cash, no receipt.

08:49.669 --> 08:51.420
- Hot day, Father.
- Hot day, Father B.

08:51.462 --> 08:53.464
- Hot day.
- Hot day, Father.

08:53.506 --> 08:55.508
Hello, Father.

08:55.550 --> 08:56.843
Don't call me that!

08:56.885 --> 08:58.219
What are you doing here?

08:58.260 --> 09:00.262
- You and Mom talked about it.
- We did...?

09:00.304 --> 09:02.390
Oscar.

09:02.431 --> 09:05.351
In fact, it was Oscar
who spoke to Lucille

09:05.393 --> 09:09.146
about hiring Gob, but not
before an ominous warning.

09:09.188 --> 09:11.816
But, you know,
he has magical abilities.

09:11.858 --> 09:15.444
He can handle a lot more
than we give him credit for.

09:15.486 --> 09:18.031
I know... What?!

09:18.072 --> 09:20.199
I would have been here sooner,
but I had to go down

09:20.241 --> 09:21.826
to San Diego
and loop my way back up

09:21.868 --> 09:23.536
because they put up
that border ribbon.

09:23.578 --> 09:25.038
- Which is totally new,
- Shh!

09:25.079 --> 09:26.622
and I wasn't expecting it;
it's fine.

09:26.664 --> 09:28.666
Anyway, Father,
you've got to get me a job

09:28.708 --> 09:30.376
so I can be prepared...
to be president.

09:30.418 --> 09:32.503
All right, you got to keep this
"father" stuff to yourself.

09:32.545 --> 09:35.048
I can't have these people think
that I raised a limo driver.

09:35.089 --> 09:36.758
I'm not a limo driver.

09:36.799 --> 09:38.426
I'm a gentleman honey farmer.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.511
The only thing I've got
back there are my bees.

09:40.553 --> 09:41.846
- Beans?
- No, bees!

09:41.888 --> 09:43.681
- Bees?
- Bees!

09:43.723 --> 09:45.725
Bees! Oh, bees!

09:45.767 --> 09:47.602
The boxes fell over
on the way here

09:47.643 --> 09:49.186
when I had to swerve
to avoid an ostrich.

09:49.228 --> 09:50.980
You got to do something
about this--these people

09:51.022 --> 09:52.273
paid a lot of money.
Do something!

09:52.314 --> 09:53.441
No, they won't listen to me.

09:53.482 --> 09:55.192
- They've all got CCD.
- CCD?

09:55.234 --> 09:56.444
Colony collapse disorder.

09:56.485 --> 09:58.279
The guy sold me
just really sick bees.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.073
Don't worry.
Dad, they're going to hive.

10:00.114 --> 10:01.407
They always hive.

10:01.449 --> 10:03.158
Usually by seeking out

10:03.200 --> 10:05.036
a structure
that most resembles a hive.

10:05.078 --> 10:08.247
Bees! Wonderful bees!

10:08.289 --> 10:10.291
It's okay.
It's okay. Gob, get in there

10:10.332 --> 10:12.126
- and get them out!
- Okay, I'm on it.

10:12.167 --> 10:13.920
But then George Sr.
got some more bad news.

10:13.962 --> 10:16.422
Hello, brother.
Thought I'd find you

10:16.464 --> 10:17.966
in a blouse and a beekeeper hat.

10:18.007 --> 10:19.425
What are you doing here?
No, no, no, no, no.

10:19.467 --> 10:21.176
We cannot be seen
next to each other.

10:21.218 --> 10:23.429
I'm Dr. Norman!

10:23.471 --> 10:24.722
Well, if you don't want
to be seen, then you

10:24.764 --> 10:27.182
go in the sweat lodge.
You owe me.

10:27.224 --> 10:29.560
Is that a fact?
Listen, you told me

10:29.602 --> 10:31.520
the property was on the border.

10:31.562 --> 10:34.440
It is 50 feet south
of the border, Oscar.

10:34.482 --> 10:38.152
Well, excuse me, but they hadn't
put up the tape yet.

10:38.193 --> 10:40.571
So I was going off Buster's map.

10:40.613 --> 10:42.573
Oh, God, it was Buster's map.

10:42.615 --> 10:44.366
Buster had indeed made the map,

10:44.408 --> 10:46.119
as a cartography student,

10:46.160 --> 10:48.746
because the class where you get
to see naked people,

10:48.788 --> 10:51.707
and draw them, was full.

10:51.749 --> 10:53.208
And you lied to me.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.294
You told me you bought
this property to live on.

10:55.336 --> 10:59.090
No, you bought this property
to put up a wall.

10:59.132 --> 11:00.675
I told one lie,

11:00.716 --> 11:02.802
but I-I was going to share
the money with you.

11:02.844 --> 11:04.470
- Two lies.
- And why do I think

11:04.512 --> 11:07.682
that you charge more than
five dollars for lemonade?

11:07.723 --> 11:09.391
Three small lies.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.686
Now, will you do me a favor,
just get in the tent.

11:11.727 --> 11:13.062
Gob's getting rid of the bees,

11:13.104 --> 11:14.605
and we'll push the matinee
till 3:00.

11:14.647 --> 11:16.983
No, I'm sick and tired
of being in that hut

11:17.025 --> 11:18.526
pretending to be you.

11:18.567 --> 11:22.237
Maybe I should go out there
and pretend to be you.

11:22.279 --> 11:23.531
So, good-bye, George.

11:23.572 --> 11:25.158
This is the last
you'll see of me.

11:25.198 --> 11:28.828
Just gonna use the can
for one second.

11:28.870 --> 11:31.330
There's two Dr. Normans!

11:34.750 --> 11:37.128
George Sr. Headed up
north to see his wife

11:37.170 --> 11:39.797
before his brother could,
but he soon found out

11:39.839 --> 11:41.590
he was too late by a day.

11:41.632 --> 11:43.342
Oh, I know what you're coming up

11:43.384 --> 11:44.927
- to do to me.
- Right.

11:44.969 --> 11:46.137
What?

11:46.179 --> 11:47.889
Yesterday, you were amazing.

11:47.930 --> 11:50.349
Georgie, I can't stop
thinking about it.

11:50.391 --> 11:52.643
You haven't been
like that in years.

11:52.685 --> 11:54.436
Oh, right.

11:54.478 --> 11:56.647
- You mean, slow-witted?
- I hope you're ready

11:56.689 --> 11:58.983
for more of the same today.

12:00.693 --> 12:02.945
Uh... Oh, God.

12:02.987 --> 12:04.488
George Sr. Had a few problems:

12:04.530 --> 12:06.281
his brother was
sleeping with his wife,

12:06.323 --> 12:07.867
the property he was going to
sell to the government...

12:09.451 --> 12:11.370
to build the U.S. Wall on
was in Mexico...

12:11.412 --> 12:13.164
All right...
all right...

12:13.206 --> 12:14.415
and his sweat lodge colony
had just collapsed.

12:14.456 --> 12:15.958
Okay.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.752
So he had to deal with
first things first.

12:17.793 --> 12:20.213
If my identical twin brother

12:20.253 --> 12:22.757
can get it up, then shouldn't I?

12:22.798 --> 12:25.009
Have you had any sexual feeling
at all lately?

12:25.051 --> 12:26.635
No!

12:26.677 --> 12:28.838
You know, the Hopi Indians
believe that this spot here,

12:28.846 --> 12:30.389
- Okay.
- when manipulated,

12:30.431 --> 12:32.808
- can create sexual feeling.
- That's my penis.

12:32.850 --> 12:35.186
Well, you don't have to tell me.
Nothing?

12:35.228 --> 12:36.771
No, just a little curiosity

12:36.812 --> 12:38.731
as to why you're checking
your second hand.

12:38.773 --> 12:40.900
Oh, this isn't my office.

12:40.942 --> 12:42.693
You know, I-I don't get it.

12:42.735 --> 12:45.238
I've been popping the pills,
and, I mean, I mean, nothing.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.280
- Are you under any pressure?
- Oh, no.

12:47.322 --> 12:48.824
Nothing out of the ordinary.

12:48.866 --> 12:50.701
I mean, there's some
violating federal law stuff

12:50.743 --> 12:53.037
that'd put me in prison
for the rest of my life,

12:53.079 --> 12:56.082
but I've made love with
treason charges over me before.

12:56.124 --> 12:57.332
But no, it's something else.

12:57.374 --> 12:58.542
It's not just the sex.

12:58.584 --> 13:01.129
I feel...

13:01.170 --> 13:03.589
I feel wrong.

13:03.631 --> 13:05.340
Somehow.

13:07.342 --> 13:10.263
And I'm becoming weak.

13:11.472 --> 13:12.890
Sorry, had the old
thinking cap on.

13:12.932 --> 13:14.683
Let's go to the lists.

13:14.725 --> 13:16.393
And Dr. Norman
proceeded to run through

13:16.435 --> 13:18.437
a checklist of alternative
medicine questions.

13:18.479 --> 13:19.939
Okay, did you drink some water
that might have

13:19.981 --> 13:21.565
a homeopathic memory
of some molecule?

13:21.607 --> 13:22.775
Do you keep track

13:22.817 --> 13:24.152
of the molecules you ingest?

13:24.193 --> 13:25.569
Well, with homeopathy,

13:25.611 --> 13:27.071
it's the molecules
you don't ingest.

13:27.113 --> 13:28.447
But I'm the one
who can get hard,

13:28.489 --> 13:30.116
so let's focus on you.

13:30.158 --> 13:32.451
He then went on to explore
some supernatural

13:32.493 --> 13:33.973
or high-concept
premise possibilities.

13:33.995 --> 13:35.704
Any earthquakes
in a Chinese restaurant

13:35.746 --> 13:37.706
- while you were trying to prove
something to your mother? - No.

13:37.748 --> 13:39.083
Any wishes you may have
phrased badly,

13:39.125 --> 13:40.835
or while a child
was blowing out a candle?

13:40.876 --> 13:42.461
No.

13:42.503 --> 13:44.297
Have you come across
any ancient games, let's say,

13:44.337 --> 13:47.591
glowing games, uh, either
board based or carnival based,

13:47.633 --> 13:50.094
that you may have played against
the wishes of your best friend?

13:50.136 --> 13:52.138
- No.
- Curses, hexes, spells,

13:52.180 --> 13:56.017
shaman, medicine men?

13:56.058 --> 13:57.685
Wait.

13:57.726 --> 14:00.104
The strong will become the weak.

14:00.146 --> 14:02.773
The weak will become the strong.

14:02.815 --> 14:06.735
I did hallucinate one ancient
foreboding warrior harbinger

14:06.777 --> 14:09.155
while I chewed maca root
about a year ago.

14:09.197 --> 14:10.948
Could that be something?

14:10.990 --> 14:12.783
No, it's not the maca.

14:12.825 --> 14:13.993
Your body wants the maca.

14:14.035 --> 14:15.369
It's not the maca.

14:15.410 --> 14:17.454
But finally,
out of desperation,

14:17.496 --> 14:18.956
he turned to Western medicine.

14:18.998 --> 14:20.708
Okay, tell you what,
let's get some film on you.

14:20.749 --> 14:23.085
I'd like you to get
on an MRI machine

14:23.127 --> 14:24.628
and try to ride it to climax.

14:24.670 --> 14:26.214
I'm gonna send you over
to Orange County Imaging--

14:26.255 --> 14:28.007
they do a ton of that.

14:28.049 --> 14:29.591
Okay, do I get magazines?

14:29.633 --> 14:31.635
Yeah, I'll write you
a script for that.

14:31.677 --> 14:34.138
They got a place right around
the corner that plays ball.

14:34.180 --> 14:35.514
Thank you.

14:35.556 --> 14:36.891
Oh, (bleep). Run.

14:36.932 --> 14:39.768
What? Oh.

14:39.810 --> 14:42.521
And soon, after getting
his prescription filled...

14:42.563 --> 14:43.522
Uh... hola...

14:43.564 --> 14:45.941
I have a, um--magazines?

14:50.154 --> 14:51.613
he was on his way

14:51.655 --> 14:54.033
to debase himself
in an MRI machine

14:54.075 --> 14:57.786
when he ran into a son
with whom he'd lost touch.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.750
Dad, what are you doing here?

15:02.791 --> 15:06.837
I wanted to speak to you...
in person.

15:06.879 --> 15:08.422
Then you're here to apologize;
that right?

15:08.463 --> 15:10.143
- Sure.
- Although, he covered pretty well.

15:10.174 --> 15:14.053
And-and of course to see you
at Orange County Im-a-gine.

15:14.095 --> 15:17.181
I went to you
for a simple signature,

15:17.223 --> 15:19.474
and you told me to go to hell.

15:19.516 --> 15:21.936
Actually, it was
the newly potent Oscar,

15:21.977 --> 15:24.313
who, like one of
Gob's sick bees,

15:24.355 --> 15:27.400
was pollinating one barren
flower after another,

15:27.441 --> 15:28.359
who told Michael to go to hell.

15:28.401 --> 15:30.361
- Go to hell.
- Huh?

15:30.403 --> 15:32.529
Which is how George Sr.

15:32.571 --> 15:34.448
not only was left with
Senor Senoritas,

15:34.489 --> 15:36.825
and that's when he got a lead
on his wall problem.

15:36.867 --> 15:38.535
Do you know a guy
named Herbert Love?

15:38.577 --> 15:40.121
I know a lot of people, sure.

15:40.162 --> 15:42.415
And soon, he surprised Michael

15:42.456 --> 15:44.499
by giving him his rights
for the movie project.

15:44.541 --> 15:48.879
I didn't know it was about
lying to a girl.

15:48.921 --> 15:51.715
- Give me the release.
- You'd do this for me?

15:51.757 --> 15:53.717
- Of course I will.
- And then, didn't surprise him.

15:53.759 --> 15:56.053
If you'll do something for me.

15:56.095 --> 15:58.180
I knew it.

15:58.222 --> 16:01.892
Michael, you got to get
this Love guy against the wall

16:01.934 --> 16:03.185
between the U.S. And Mexico.

16:03.227 --> 16:04.603
That's not right.

16:04.645 --> 16:05.938
You're really opposed
to this wall, huh?

16:05.980 --> 16:07.106
When did you
become pro-immigrant?

16:07.148 --> 16:08.232
I have changed, Michael.

16:08.274 --> 16:10.818
I cry

16:10.859 --> 16:13.737
at the drop of a hat,
and I hate the way I look.

16:13.779 --> 16:16.782
I actually had one cute hat,
and it...

16:16.824 --> 16:21.620
it blew off
at the CVS parking lot.

16:21.662 --> 16:24.581
And this whole car
full of black kids ran over it,

16:24.623 --> 16:25.707
for no reason.

16:25.749 --> 16:28.419
And they saw it!

16:28.461 --> 16:30.254
They saw it!

16:30.296 --> 16:32.047
Michael...

16:34.091 --> 16:37.345
Anyway, I live down there now.

16:37.386 --> 16:39.805
And I care for these people
who just want

16:39.847 --> 16:42.850
to come into this country
and ply their wares

16:42.891 --> 16:45.727
and let us freely fill the bay
with their culture.

16:45.769 --> 16:47.729
Hey, don't get me started
on the Cinco, Dad.

16:47.771 --> 16:49.523
I haven't been to one
in 20 years.

16:49.564 --> 16:51.275
There's gonna be blowback there;
it's just gonna happen.

16:51.317 --> 16:53.444
You can't swim in that bay
for a month after

16:53.486 --> 16:55.237
without getting
nacho cheese sauce in your hair.

16:55.279 --> 16:56.530
It's coming.

16:56.571 --> 16:58.907
Can you help me, then,
with Love?

16:58.949 --> 17:00.742
At his speech, at Cinco?

17:00.784 --> 17:02.703
Can you do that for your dad?

17:02.744 --> 17:05.873
What he didn't tell Michael was
that the family would go broke

17:05.914 --> 17:07.875
if they had to build the wall.

17:07.915 --> 17:09.960
Of course I will.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.214
Maybe, if he had,
Michael wouldn't have

17:14.256 --> 17:16.633
overplayed his hand
as a big-shot producer

17:16.675 --> 17:18.593
who knew lots of people.

17:18.635 --> 17:20.054
But a deal was soon struck...

17:20.095 --> 17:21.637
- Thanks, Pop.
- All right.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.557
and Michael,
signed contract in hand,

17:23.598 --> 17:25.684
went to show off
at the Ealing Club,

17:25.726 --> 17:28.145
while George Sr.,
magazine in hand,

17:28.186 --> 17:30.939
went to (bleep) off
in an MRI machine.

17:36.737 --> 17:39.907
George Sr. Finally
went to visit a wife

17:39.948 --> 17:42.910
who was under the impression
that he was back for more.

17:42.951 --> 17:44.328
The wrong land?

17:44.370 --> 17:46.247
It's under control;
I'm trying to get Love

17:46.288 --> 17:47.873
to come out against the wall.

17:47.915 --> 17:50.334
We can't afford to build it
if we're not

17:50.376 --> 17:52.294
selling the land
back to the government.

17:52.336 --> 17:53.837
It'll ruin us.

17:53.879 --> 17:56.173
It'll ruin us
if we don't build it.

17:56.215 --> 17:58.842
George, you've gone puny again.

17:58.884 --> 18:01.303
Where's the man who took
ahold of me yesterday

18:01.345 --> 18:02.721
and bent me over this couch?

18:02.763 --> 18:05.516
Okay, okay,
let's not sully its memory.

18:05.558 --> 18:09.728
Look, we make sure Herbert Love
comes out against the wall,

18:09.770 --> 18:11.813
right after we get
enough of it up

18:11.855 --> 18:13.732
to trigger
the government payment.

18:13.774 --> 18:16.485
And speaking of
getting enough of it up,

18:16.527 --> 18:18.153
what's going on down here?

18:18.195 --> 18:21.698
You need a little more Marilyn
like I did yesterday?

18:21.740 --> 18:24.785
♪ Happy birthday,
Mr. President... ♪

18:24.826 --> 18:26.287
I-I don't want to be
Mr. President.

18:26.328 --> 18:29.081
Huh. Especially with
all this going down.

18:29.123 --> 18:32.376
Oh, and speaking of president,
what's happening with Gob?

18:32.418 --> 18:33.710
You gave him a job?

18:33.752 --> 18:35.463
Yes, but then I-I fired him.

18:35.504 --> 18:37.339
He caused my colony to collapse.

18:37.381 --> 18:40.675
Oh, my God, George,
get him another job.

18:40.717 --> 18:43.471
You must have some favors
you can call in somewhere.

18:43.512 --> 18:47.682
And then you can have some of
my favors, Mr. President.

18:47.724 --> 18:49.477
As much as I'd like to stay

18:49.518 --> 18:50.936
and lay some more pipe with you,

18:50.978 --> 18:52.854
I better get moving
on this thing.

18:52.896 --> 18:54.106
And so, the next day,

18:54.148 --> 18:56.484
George Sr. Once again
called upon his son.

18:56.525 --> 18:58.026
Michael B. Project.

18:58.068 --> 18:59.987
Yeah, you got to give Gob a job.

19:00.028 --> 19:01.572
Something in
the, uh, building company

19:01.614 --> 19:04.575
or, uh, hey, I think
he'd get a big kick

19:04.617 --> 19:05.867
out of the movie business.

19:05.909 --> 19:07.119
N-N-No, Dad, hey.

19:07.161 --> 19:08.870
He knows nothing
about producing.

19:08.912 --> 19:11.123
Look, I don't care
if it's producing a movie

19:11.165 --> 19:12.541
that's never gonna be made

19:12.583 --> 19:14.793
or selling houses
that no one's gonna buy,

19:14.835 --> 19:17.296
I just want my son
to have a job

19:17.338 --> 19:20.174
where his incompetence
won't be out of place.

19:20.215 --> 19:22.384
Anyway, he's on his way
to Sudden Valley now.

19:22.426 --> 19:24.261
No, he isn't.
No, no, come on, Dad...

19:24.303 --> 19:25.720
- No, no, now?
- What, what?

19:25.762 --> 19:27.264
He's gonna make it
less valuable?

19:27.306 --> 19:28.723
Which I told you
was gonna happen, by the way.

19:28.765 --> 19:30.058
Oh, here it is.
Here it is.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.935
Yeah, there it is!
Knew it was coming.

19:31.977 --> 19:34.438
And even though George
had imposed on Michael,

19:34.480 --> 19:35.856
it was Gob...

19:35.897 --> 19:37.732
What the hell?

19:37.774 --> 19:39.776
who felt
he had a cross to bear.

19:39.818 --> 19:42.530
What the hell?

19:44.281 --> 19:45.782
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, I got the right of--

19:45.824 --> 19:47.544
- Hey, hey, hey...
- N-No, don't. It's mine.

19:47.576 --> 19:49.453
- Okay, coming through here.
- Mine... Hah!

19:49.495 --> 19:52.122
No... no, no!
My right of... way!

19:52.164 --> 19:53.707
- There! Mine!
- Okay.

19:53.748 --> 19:54.958
Hey...

19:59.672 --> 20:00.673
Gob!

20:00.714 --> 20:02.174
Michael!

20:02.216 --> 20:03.467
And the two brothers
reunited...

20:03.509 --> 20:04.552
Hey, Gob.

20:04.593 --> 20:05.594
Michael.

20:05.636 --> 20:07.179
happy to see each other.

20:07.221 --> 20:08.681
Gob?

20:08.722 --> 20:10.140
At first.

20:10.182 --> 20:12.601
Michael.

20:12.643 --> 20:14.520
So, hear you need help moving

20:14.562 --> 20:17.481
these memorials to the death
of the housing market.

20:20.275 --> 20:21.735
Actually that was a memorial

20:21.776 --> 20:24.196
- to the death of Pete the mailman.
- I knew that.

20:24.238 --> 20:27.616
I brought one, too--
size of the man's heart.

20:27.658 --> 20:30.452
I just got to figure out
how to get it out of the car.

20:30.494 --> 20:32.371
If I could remember
how I got it in.

20:32.413 --> 20:34.331
That's not
from your Christian magic act?

20:34.373 --> 20:36.542
Christian magic act?

20:36.584 --> 20:38.960
If I were Muslim, would you say
"Muslim magic act"?

20:39.002 --> 20:43.006
No, but it is hard to imagine
any Muslim handcuffing himself

20:43.048 --> 20:45.926
to a glittery cross
and living to tell about it.

20:45.967 --> 20:48.303
Yeah, well, the Christians
aren't so (bleep)-hot

20:48.345 --> 20:50.097
about it either.

20:50.138 --> 20:52.474
Hmm, well...

20:52.516 --> 20:55.143
Michael could see
that his brother was unhappy

20:55.185 --> 20:56.937
and that his life had not
worked out

20:56.978 --> 20:58.813
the way he had hoped.

20:58.855 --> 21:02.776
Things are incredible for me,
I'm having an incredible year.

21:02.817 --> 21:05.320
I am a movie producer now,
producing a movie,

21:05.362 --> 21:06.821
so they've got me
in this enormous office.

21:06.863 --> 21:08.303
I told 'em
I don't want to be driving

21:08.323 --> 21:09.908
to Beverly Hills
every single day,

21:09.950 --> 21:13.203
so they put me in an enormous
office just over here.

21:15.997 --> 21:17.541
Rental.

21:17.583 --> 21:20.419
My personal life is off
the charts. I've met someone.

21:20.461 --> 21:23.297
Can't really give you any
information--kind of famousy.

21:23.338 --> 21:24.965
- Well, good for you. I also met someone.
- Have you?

21:25.006 --> 21:27.509
Also famousy.
Can't give you any information.

21:27.551 --> 21:30.095
In fact, Michael didn't even
find out who she was

21:30.137 --> 21:32.222
until one night, earlier.

21:32.264 --> 21:34.642
Oh, my God. I'm dating Ron
Howard's girlfriend.

21:34.683 --> 21:37.269
Although he did have
some of the details wrong.

21:37.311 --> 21:39.396
She's an actress.
You know her.

21:39.438 --> 21:42.650
She was Ron's
illegitimate daughter,

21:42.691 --> 21:44.067
a fact unbeknownst to many.

21:44.109 --> 21:45.944
Well, we kind of like to keep
that quiet.

21:45.986 --> 21:50.157
A woman who, like Bryce Dallas
and Paige Carlyle,

21:50.198 --> 21:53.160
was named after
where she was conceived.

21:53.201 --> 21:57.038
And she actually had worked
for some A-list directors.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.499
She did a Terrence Malick...

21:58.540 --> 22:00.793
Are we the same?

22:00.834 --> 22:02.294
She got the lead
in a Woody Allen film...

22:02.336 --> 22:04.016
But I felt like I was in
The Iceman Cometh,

22:04.045 --> 22:06.548
but, you know,
in my case, he faketh.

22:06.590 --> 22:08.717
and was once even directed
by her own father.

22:08.759 --> 22:09.843
Action!

22:09.884 --> 22:11.804
Next time, don't pocket it,

22:11.845 --> 22:12.846
pay for it.

22:12.887 --> 22:15.265
Shoplifting: not cool.

22:15.307 --> 22:18.185
- ... in a public service announcement.
- And cut!

22:18.226 --> 22:19.353
Which, like all of
Ron's work...

22:19.394 --> 22:20.562
You know, I think we got it.

22:20.604 --> 22:22.648
was inspired
by a photograph.

22:22.690 --> 22:24.399
Rebel was indeed a rebel.

22:24.441 --> 22:27.402
But Michael didn't possess
that information.

22:27.444 --> 22:29.404
I can give you some information
about your airless office

22:29.446 --> 22:30.989
you're gonna be spending
most mornings in.

22:31.031 --> 22:32.449
You know, what I could go for
is some guac.

22:32.491 --> 22:33.950
Well, you don't live there
anymore, Gob.

22:33.992 --> 22:36.203
This heat just makes,
makes me want guac.

22:36.244 --> 22:38.246
Now, now, I know
I've got these things,

22:38.288 --> 22:40.791
uh, very, you know,
meticulously maintained.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.293
There's...

22:43.335 --> 22:44.503
There are some vultures.

22:44.545 --> 22:46.672
I think they might
still smell Pete.

22:46.714 --> 22:48.674
Yeah, if it wasn't for the movie
thing, I would do it myself.

22:48.716 --> 22:50.342
They practically sell
themselves; you just got

22:50.384 --> 22:52.469
- to bring the people in.
- I'm ready to move in today.

22:52.511 --> 22:54.346
No, well, people other than you,

22:54.388 --> 22:55.972
- bring those people in.
- I'm starving.

22:56.014 --> 22:57.265
Starving? No, you're not
gonna find anything here.

22:57.307 --> 22:58.467
They've been abandoned for...

23:00.893 --> 23:03.271
Lindsay.

23:03.313 --> 23:06.149
No, no, this--maybe Tobias.

23:06.191 --> 23:07.359
It was John Beard.

23:07.401 --> 23:08.943
Shall we?

23:08.985 --> 23:10.696
Well, the value of these homes
isn't gonna go down

23:10.738 --> 23:11.946
if we don't sell one today.

23:11.988 --> 23:14.658
Let me see
if I can find a, uh...

23:14.700 --> 23:16.034
Do you have a bottle opener?

23:16.076 --> 23:18.036
Great idea.

23:18.078 --> 23:20.330
And after a few more drinks and
a little more depreciation...

23:20.372 --> 23:22.374
- That was surprising.
- ... Michael admitted he had

23:22.416 --> 23:23.792
a rival for his girlfriend.

23:23.834 --> 23:26.503
You don't have to worry
about Ron Howard.

23:26.545 --> 23:28.422
I mean, he's not
competition for you.

23:28.463 --> 23:29.757
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, the guy's

23:29.798 --> 23:31.550
like 100 years old.
What's he gonna do,

23:31.592 --> 23:32.925
poke you in the eyes?

23:32.967 --> 23:34.094
Oh, you're confused.

23:34.135 --> 23:35.178
Ron Howard directed Apollo 13.

23:35.220 --> 23:36.889
You're thinking of Moe Howard,

23:36.929 --> 23:38.891
the angry stooge who's been dead
for a quarter century.

23:38.931 --> 23:40.726
Well, that's good 'cause the
whole time I'm thinking, like,

23:40.768 --> 23:42.060
"unless she likes
a guy who's funny."

23:42.102 --> 23:43.771
- Sure.
- Because that guy is funny.

23:43.812 --> 23:45.313
- 'Cause the whole time you're like...
- You know...

23:45.355 --> 23:47.107
- "Is he gonna poke me in the eyes?"
- Gob,

23:47.148 --> 23:49.693
I don't think that th-the
movie--it might not even happen

23:49.735 --> 23:51.737
because I don't think
that I can ask my son.

23:51.779 --> 23:54.406
What happened between him and me
was very disappointing.

23:54.448 --> 23:56.450
You don't need to tell me
about disappointment and sons.

23:56.491 --> 23:59.411
Let's not forget Steve Holt.

23:59.453 --> 24:01.830
That's the story
of our relationship.

24:01.872 --> 24:04.040
Right, well, I was talking about
a son disappointing a father.

24:04.082 --> 24:05.626
Yeah, that does make it
different.

24:05.667 --> 24:08.128
Look, Michael,
he doesn't respect you,

24:08.169 --> 24:09.421
so you have
to make him respect you.

24:09.463 --> 24:11.005
Show him that you're a big shot,

24:11.047 --> 24:13.049
that you don't need to
live in your son's dorm.

24:13.091 --> 24:15.260
No, I just live
in my parents' penthouse now.

24:15.302 --> 24:17.095
Well, then, take him to the
Ealing Club; it's all showbiz.

24:17.137 --> 24:18.513
I used to hang out there
all the time.

24:18.555 --> 24:20.557
It's just actresses
and stuff like that.

24:20.599 --> 24:22.225
I don't know
if I could pick up the phone

24:22.267 --> 24:24.060
and call him and ask him.

24:24.102 --> 24:25.479
- You know what, Michael?
- Hmm?

24:25.520 --> 24:27.314
I'll call him for you.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.400
Really, you'd do that for me?

24:30.442 --> 24:31.944
It's the least I could do.

24:31.984 --> 24:34.028
You've given me
a new sense of purpose.

24:34.070 --> 24:36.949
Did you actually have
an old one?

24:36.989 --> 24:38.949
'Cause it always seemed
like you were just looking

24:38.951 --> 24:40.327
for the easy way out.

24:40.368 --> 24:42.871
Yeah, that was it.

24:42.913 --> 24:45.540
Hi, I'm George Bluth
of the Bluth Company, and, uh...

24:45.582 --> 24:47.462
George Sr.,
meanwhile, was also finding

24:47.501 --> 24:48.901
an easy way out
of the wall problem.

24:48.919 --> 24:50.337
we've built this wall.

24:50.378 --> 24:54.591
We have miles and,
and miles of wall.

24:54.633 --> 24:56.551
Will you confirm that, soldier?

24:59.095 --> 25:00.639
It's ab-about protecting
our border,

25:00.681 --> 25:02.432
which is why, uh,
we have a member

25:02.474 --> 25:05.435
of our armed forces
with us today.

25:05.477 --> 25:07.228
Say hello.

25:08.772 --> 25:11.274
It's, uh, triple-reinforced,
steel-reinforced,

25:11.316 --> 25:14.194
and I don't really
know how to, how to say

25:14.235 --> 25:17.572
that, uh, what it does is,
it protects, um...

25:17.614 --> 25:19.157
It's Mexican-proof.

25:19.199 --> 25:20.951
So... can't say... it...

25:20.993 --> 25:22.786
Well, gosh darn it,

25:22.828 --> 25:24.663
it is Mexican-proof.

25:25.873 --> 25:27.039
Sit up.

25:27.081 --> 25:28.291
- Uh...
- Daddy, my tummy's turning.

25:28.333 --> 25:29.710
All right.

25:29.751 --> 25:31.252
- Uh, it's, uh, triple-reinforced.
- I got...

25:31.294 --> 25:32.587
Daddy, I got to get out,

25:32.629 --> 25:34.046
- I got to get out.
- Uh, we're gonna be...

25:34.088 --> 25:35.382
Oh, for God's sakes, get out.

25:35.423 --> 25:36.967
I need to get out,
I need to get out.

25:37.009 --> 25:38.719
- Oh, for...
- I need to get out, I need to get out.

25:38.760 --> 25:41.596
We're not gonna... we'll edit
this part out and, uh...

25:41.638 --> 25:43.348
Anyhow...

25:43.390 --> 25:45.976
But George Sr.
hadn't built miles of wall.

25:46.018 --> 25:50.104
He just found a roundabout way
to make it seem that way,

25:50.146 --> 25:52.566
and one week later at Cinco,
George arrived,

25:52.607 --> 25:53.984
hoping to hear Herbert Love...

25:54.026 --> 25:55.819
No, thanks. I've already crushed
one with my car.

25:55.861 --> 25:58.822
sway public opinion
against the wall

25:58.864 --> 26:00.657
so the Bluth Company
wouldn't be on the hook

26:00.699 --> 26:02.074
- to build it for real.
- Pop, hey, hi.

26:02.116 --> 26:04.036
- Michael, what happened?
- Yeah.

26:04.076 --> 26:05.996
Oh, the--it's a terrible week,

26:06.038 --> 26:08.415
but I'm gonna fix things
once and for all right now.

26:08.456 --> 26:10.042
- Is this about Love?
- No, it's about money,

26:10.082 --> 26:15.047
but I-I'm--I will pay her back,
uh, one way or the other.

26:15.087 --> 26:16.130
Who?

26:16.172 --> 26:17.465
Lucille 2--I'm gonna get her

26:17.507 --> 26:19.300
- against the wall.
- No, no, no, no, no,

26:19.342 --> 26:21.177
she cannot know about this wall.

26:21.219 --> 26:23.471
Fine, I'll get her up against
the top of the staircar.

26:23.513 --> 26:25.432
I don't care,
it's gonna happen, though.

26:25.473 --> 26:27.059
I am talking about Herbert Love.

26:27.099 --> 26:29.728
- Is he going to oppose the
building of the wall? - Oh, yes.

26:29.770 --> 26:31.271
I took care of that.

26:31.312 --> 26:33.565
He is going to announce that
in his speech tonight.

26:33.607 --> 26:34.566
That is great news.

26:34.608 --> 26:36.317
Listen, I-I-I have to go.

26:36.359 --> 26:39.279
I have to see if I can pass
this testosterone test.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.822
I do, too.

26:40.864 --> 26:42.991
And, listen, not a word to...

26:43.033 --> 26:44.659
How dare you?

26:44.701 --> 26:48.120
Lucille 2.

26:48.162 --> 26:50.082
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

26:50.122 --> 26:51.583
I was going to cut you in.

26:51.625 --> 26:52.834
I was trying to protect you

26:52.876 --> 26:54.795
so they wouldn't link you to it,

26:54.836 --> 26:57.380
but it turns out that we can't
afford to build it anyway.

26:57.422 --> 27:01.051
- Build what?
- The wall in Mexico, the, the high wall.

27:01.093 --> 27:03.386
- What were, what were you talking about?
- I was talking

27:03.428 --> 27:06.807
about you giving money
to Herbert Love in his campaign

27:06.848 --> 27:08.892
- against me.
- Oh, no, no,

27:08.934 --> 27:11.061
that was to get Love
to support the wall.

27:11.103 --> 27:13.354
Oh, I tell you, I've been
all over the place on this one.

27:13.396 --> 27:16.148
I can't be running a company
that's building a wall

27:16.190 --> 27:17.400
I campaigned against!

27:17.442 --> 27:20.070
Listen to me,
it's taken care of.

27:20.112 --> 27:21.153
I just ran into Michael.

27:21.195 --> 27:24.074
He's got Love against the wall.

27:24.116 --> 27:26.326
It's done, it's gonna be in
the speech tonight, it's over.

27:26.367 --> 27:27.911
It better be,

27:27.953 --> 27:30.789
or I'll talk about it
in my speech tonight.

27:30.831 --> 27:33.333
Now, I've got a staircar
to wave from.

27:33.374 --> 27:34.751
And I can't be seen with you.

27:34.793 --> 27:36.168
'Cause I'm fat.

27:36.210 --> 27:38.170
It's because I am fat.

27:38.212 --> 27:40.214
You think I'm a fat person.

27:40.256 --> 27:42.634
You are such a drama queen.

27:42.676 --> 27:43.844
George Sr. Was worried.

27:43.885 --> 27:45.386
These fat arms.

27:45.428 --> 27:46.930
I don't understand this.

27:46.972 --> 27:49.766
And so, it was in
a state of agitation

27:49.808 --> 27:52.352
that George Sr. Arrived
for his doctor's appointment.

27:52.393 --> 27:53.561
Excuse me, Dr. Norman?

27:53.603 --> 27:55.563
- You're mistaken.
- Dr. Norman,

27:55.605 --> 27:57.607
it's me, George Bluth.

27:57.649 --> 28:01.528
Oh, George, yes,
thank you for meeting me here.

28:01.569 --> 28:05.740
I like to do a little
housecleaning on the fourth.

28:07.283 --> 28:08.910
Old quinceañera candles.

28:08.952 --> 28:12.998
I was wondering if you could
tell me my test results.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.415
Oh, yes, yes, uh, well,

28:14.457 --> 28:16.376
your testosterone numbers
are off the charts.

28:17.627 --> 28:18.753
Below the charts,
under the charts.

28:18.795 --> 28:20.672
I don't know how to say that.

28:20.714 --> 28:22.382
You have almost
no testosterone at all.

28:22.423 --> 28:24.384
I don't know the exact numbers,
but it's somewhere

28:24.425 --> 28:25.886
in the baby range.

28:25.927 --> 28:28.304
On the plus side,
your estrogen levels are that

28:28.346 --> 28:31.183
of a very healthy woman
in the throes of her menses.

28:31.224 --> 28:33.060
May I see my results?

28:33.101 --> 28:34.853
Ah, I wish you'd asked me
about five minutes ago.

28:34.895 --> 28:36.104
I think I dumped it
with a pot pipe

28:36.146 --> 28:37.438
and a bottle
of cheetah sedative.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.440
Also, the people
at Orange County Imaging

28:39.482 --> 28:42.736
said that you were masturbating
in an MRI tube?

28:43.653 --> 28:45.030
- Oh, no.
- But, Doctor,

28:45.072 --> 28:46.198
you, you told me to.

28:46.239 --> 28:47.365
I did no such thing.

28:47.407 --> 28:48.324
Oh, no.

28:48.366 --> 28:51.327
No, no, you can't do that.

28:51.369 --> 28:53.038
That sounds like something
I would say

28:53.080 --> 28:54.581
when I had my thinking cap on.

28:55.957 --> 28:58.376
You, sir, are a very funny lady.

29:01.004 --> 29:04.507
That's what they always say
to the unattractive one.

29:04.549 --> 29:07.468
It was finally time
for Herbert Love

29:07.510 --> 29:11.472
to make his speech, when the
party was suddenly ransacked.

29:11.514 --> 29:13.141
Of course, it was Cinco,

29:13.183 --> 29:14.768
so it took a while
for anyone to notice.

29:14.809 --> 29:16.728
It appeared
the Hispanic community had had

29:16.770 --> 29:18.354
enough of Cinco de Cuatro.

29:18.396 --> 29:20.481
- Oh, God, the blowback.
- Put up this wall!

29:20.523 --> 29:22.400
But the blowback created
a greater blowback

29:22.442 --> 29:25.070
as the crowd that had gathered
to hear Herbert Love speak

29:25.112 --> 29:26.320
was whipped into a frenzy.

29:26.362 --> 29:28.949
Put up this wall!
Put up this wall!

29:28.990 --> 29:31.659
And that's when George knew
he was in real trouble.

29:31.701 --> 29:33.453
Put up this wall!

29:33.494 --> 29:36.873
Fortunately,
he was able to find a disguise.

29:40.043 --> 29:41.419
Oh, God.

29:41.461 --> 29:44.547
- Unfortunately...
- This feels right.

29:49.594 --> 29:52.139
Lindsay surprises Michael

29:52.180 --> 29:54.224
after a long absence
from his life.

29:54.266 --> 29:56.268
Lindsay.

29:56.309 --> 29:57.894
It's been a long time.

29:57.936 --> 29:59.229
I know.

29:59.271 --> 30:02.232
Oh, this is
a little embarrassing.

30:02.274 --> 30:03.775
But I have been meaning
to get down there,

30:03.817 --> 30:05.652
- so let's just...
- You're right,

30:05.693 --> 30:08.655
I mean, it's not like we're
even technically related.

30:08.696 --> 30:12.659
- That's true.
- Okay, well, then, I'll start with a smear.

30:14.869 --> 30:16.663
And George Sr. Gets
more comfortable in hiding.

30:16.704 --> 30:18.123
Yes?

30:18.165 --> 30:20.041
Uh, Detective Smee,
Orange County Police.

30:20.083 --> 30:21.375
I need to speak with you.

30:21.417 --> 30:24.712
Lucille Austero went missing
last night.

30:24.754 --> 30:26.631
- You mind if we ask you a few questions?
- Oh...!

30:26.673 --> 30:28.508
I-I don't allow men
in my apartment

30:28.549 --> 30:30.394
without my husband present.
