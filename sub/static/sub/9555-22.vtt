Oh, hi, Fonz.

01:39.399 --> 01:42.892
Fonz, I can't hear,
the jukebox is too loud.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.632
Okay.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.366
-(fingers snap)
-(jukebox stops playing)

01:50.811 --> 01:52.210
That's terrific, Fonz.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.541
Thanks.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.444
Uh... Rich.

01:55.582 --> 01:56.447
Rich!

01:56.583 --> 01:57.846
CHACHI:
He's not here.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.419
Not here, Fonz.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.113
Uh-huh, yeah, your place,
an emergency.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.984
Will do, Fonz, yeah.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.593
Oh, hey, Fonz,
turn it on again, will you?

Know something, Pots?

02:25.145 --> 02:26.044
Yeah.

02:26.179 --> 02:27.669
Studying Sherlock Holmes
in lit class

02:27.814 --> 02:29.714
is the best thing that ever
happened to us.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.511
It doesn't seem
too practical, Malph.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.211
Hey.

02:36.757 --> 02:37.747
Sherlock Holmes!

02:37.891 --> 02:39.381
You're just the guy
I wanted to see.

02:39.526 --> 02:40.425
Yeah, right.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.028
Boy, do I have a deal for you.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.824
No, thanks, Chach, I can't
afford any more of your deals.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.160
What is it, Chach?

02:46.299 --> 02:49.234
Inspiration Point
bad weather insurance.

02:49.369 --> 02:52.066
You see, if it rains, you come
here for a free evening.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.468
No sale, Chach.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.803
Look, guys, how many times

02:55.942 --> 02:57.273
have you gone to
Inspiration Point, right?

02:57.411 --> 02:58.810
Everything's going just great.

02:58.945 --> 03:01.710
You've got the top down on the
car so you can count the stars,

03:01.848 --> 03:04.874
<i>you've got her
'm the mood... and ham'.!</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:06.884
I don't usually
get as far as bam.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.122
Look, I mean...

03:11.258 --> 03:13.124
I mean, bam, it starts to rain.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.352
How much is it?

03:14.494 --> 03:16.792
A mere 50 cents for 30 days.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.557
- I'll take it.
- Malph?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.599
Uh, I'm gonna pass
on this one, Chach.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.758
- Got it...
- Now look, Ralph,

03:21.902 --> 03:24.667
you know
I never give up on a customer.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.743
Unless a prettier
customer comes by.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.576
See you later, guys.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.043
See ya, Chach.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.079
(laughs)

03:34.214 --> 03:36.012
You're such a Potsie!

03:37.417 --> 03:38.543
Hey, Malph...
what can I lose?

03:38.685 --> 03:40.050
It's only 50 cents.

03:40.187 --> 03:43.020
Yeah, that's what you said when
he sold you the talking rock.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.792
He explained to me
why I couldn't hear the rock.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.726
Rocks talk
at a higher frequency.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.628
- Rich...
-(startled shout)

04:00.774 --> 04:02.242
Oh, Al, I'm sorry.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.934
Had to bring this by for Ralph.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.476
We're studying Sherlock Holmes.

04:05.612 --> 04:06.636
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Wait, wait, wait...

04:06.780 --> 04:07.906
- Holmes, he was great.
- Fonzie called for you.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.642
He wants you to go to his garage
right away-- emergency.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.115
- Emergency?
- Yeah.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.515
All right, uh, will you
give this to Ralph?

04:13.653 --> 04:14.779
Sure.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.582
Or see if you can find some meat
in your hamburgers.

04:16.723 --> 04:17.656
(laughs)

04:17.791 --> 04:18.849
Just a little Sherlock humor.

04:18.992 --> 04:19.857
I'll see you.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.961
Wow!
How big everybody looks.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.130
Fonz?

04:35.475 --> 04:37.273
Fonz, are you here?

04:37.410 --> 04:39.276
I got here
as quick as I could, I...

04:41.748 --> 04:43.773
Hmm.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.146
Jelly donut.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.275
Hey, Red, while you're here,

04:46.419 --> 04:48.444
will you pass me
my last jelly donut?

04:50.357 --> 04:52.325
Yeah, uh, sure, Fonz.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.449
There you go.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.096
I got an emergency.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.224
L-I didn't know the jelly donut
was that important to you, Fonz.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.427
No, not the donut, huh?

05:03.570 --> 05:04.833
Look at this.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.131
Well, you can buy
a lot of donuts with that.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.104
Hundred dollar bills!

05:11.244 --> 05:13.178
Hey, feast your eyes
on this, Red.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.520
Look at all that money.
There's gotta be...

05:21.655 --> 05:22.554
there's thousands
of dollars in here.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.088
(scoffing):
Yeah!

05:24.224 --> 05:25.555
What's all this money doing
in the back of a coffin?

05:25.692 --> 05:27.353
Red, if I knew that, I wouldn't
have had to call you.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.053
Maybe this guy
wants to take it with him.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.459
-(both chuckle)
- Yeah, well...

05:30.597 --> 05:31.826
- Guess it takes all kinds, huh?
- Yeah, huh?

05:31.965 --> 05:32.898
But when he gets
to the Pearly Gates,

05:33.033 --> 05:33.898
they're gonna send him back.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.126
That's funny money.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.633
- Counterfeit?
- Yeah.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.899
I dated a teller once and we
kind of exchanged... knowledge.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.269
Oh, yeah...

05:41.408 --> 05:42.967
You know, she was kind of like,
uh, a kiss-and-teller.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.270
-(both laughing)
- That's a good one.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.742
That's another story.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.074
Yeah, all right, all right.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.012
Uh, let me do a little
deducing here, all right?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.810
- Follow this path.
- Yeah.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.976
Okay, uh, I don't see
your tow truck here,

05:53.119 --> 05:55.486
so obviously you got a hurry-up
call to fix a hearse.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.215
- FONZIE: Right.
- You picked up the hearse.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.586
You returned with it.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.819
You returned with the hearse
and you noticed that, uh,

06:00.961 --> 06:03.396
that the ride had jiggled open
a secret panel

06:03.530 --> 06:04.497
in the back of the coffin.

06:04.631 --> 06:05.689
How am I doing so far?

06:05.832 --> 06:07.527
I don't have time to play
Shylock Holmes.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.533
- That's Sherlock.
- I knew that. I knew that.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.034
I gotta take this back.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.900
Wait a minute, you're gonna
take this back?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.632
What am I gonna do,
bury the guy here?

06:16.610 --> 06:17.634
There's somebody in there?

06:19.446 --> 06:20.811
Be my guest.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.782
You already looked, Fonz?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.408
Uh, listen, don't, don't push me
there, Cunningham.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.317
Don't push me.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.718
Well, you're not a...
afraid, are you, Fonz?

06:29.856 --> 06:31.290
No.

06:31.424 --> 06:32.619
I'm not afraid.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.454
Hey, that's good,
that's very good.

06:34.594 --> 06:35.823
Shall we take a look?

06:35.962 --> 06:36.952
No, no.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.122
Rigor mortis gives me
depression.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.325
Look, I don't think you should
return this at all, Fonz.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.629
I got to, Red.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.233
Fonz, these people from the
Heavenly Slumber Funeral Parlor,

06:46.373 --> 06:47.670
they could be mixed up
in this thing.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.276
You could be driving into
a veritable den of criminals.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.900
I think you should go
to the police first.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.979
Hey, look, like my Grandma
Nussbaum always said,

06:54.114 --> 06:57.140
"you don't eat the stew until
those potatoes fall apart."

06:57.284 --> 06:58.718
- What does that mean?
- What does it mean--

06:58.852 --> 07:00.377
I'm gonna take the hearse back
and then call the police.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.919
I don't want to
cause nobody suspicion.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.921
Oh, no suspicions.
Well, that's a pretty good idea.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.923
Oh, thanks very much.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.493
Fonz, just do me
one favor, okay?

07:07.627 --> 07:08.651
What's that?

07:08.795 --> 07:10.559
Don't make a mistake.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.495
Don't make a what?

07:12.632 --> 07:13.622
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.996
I just made a mistake. I...

07:16.670 --> 07:17.967
Fonz don't make mistakes.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.334
No. All right.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.302
(engine starts)

07:33.420 --> 07:35.787
But-but Fonz,
you already made a...

07:37.424 --> 07:38.914
I don't like the look of this.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.624
(thunder rumbles)

07:47.667 --> 07:48.964
(thunder rumbles)

07:49.102 --> 07:50.331
(cat screeching)

07:50.470 --> 07:52.905
(man laughing)

07:55.008 --> 07:56.169
gumdrop!

07:56.309 --> 07:57.606
Gumdrop, Candy Man.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.906
And get rid of that cat, Sticky.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.105
But you just did, Candy Man.

08:02.248 --> 08:03.409
You stepped on him.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.540
(laughs)

08:04.684 --> 08:06.243
I do the laughing.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.321
(laughing)

08:09.456 --> 08:11.925
Now, where is the hearse?

08:12.058 --> 08:12.957
- In the front.
- In the back.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.356
- In the back.
- In the front.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.359
You're fools.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.463
- I know, I know.
- CANDY MAN: Well...

08:17.597 --> 08:20.658
just make sure it's ready
for that Chicago delivery.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.858
And let's get rid
of these dummies.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.060
They're all worn out.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.227
But that's Peter.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.896
He's my friend.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.336
I want new ones.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.033
You'll have them
in the morning, Candy Man.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.939
Eugene,
let's see if the mechanic

08:31.077 --> 08:32.169
has brought the hearse back yet.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.302
Yeah.

08:35.381 --> 08:36.577
(thunder rumbling)

08:44.324 --> 08:45.485
Well, come on, Marion.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.558
We've got to get over
to the Andersons'.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.751
Listen, Stacy.

08:47.894 --> 08:49.760
If he gets in,
have him call me right away.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.762
Well, well, all right, after.

08:51.898 --> 08:55.198
You know how they hate it
when we're late for bridge.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.133
That's because
they always beat us.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.602
Yeah, well, that's because
they cheat, Marion.

08:59.739 --> 09:00.968
Have a good bridge game.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.667
Remember, this time we're gonna
fight fire with fire.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.405
When you see me tugging at my
ear, that means I have hearts.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.776
I'll try to remember, dear.

09:08.915 --> 09:10.314
Yeah, and what if I sneeze, huh?

09:10.450 --> 09:12.282
L-I give you a tissue.

09:14.054 --> 09:14.919
No, Marion.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.114
If I sneeze,
that means I have clubs.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.352
Well, what if you sneeze and you
don't have clubs?

09:20.493 --> 09:22.757
Then you give me a tissue.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.866
Oh, I hate to play bridge
with your father.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.592
Okay.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.725
(thunder rumbling)

09:31.638 --> 09:32.730
I'll try one more.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.074
Operator?

09:36.209 --> 09:37.506
Yes, uh, do you have a number

09:37.644 --> 09:40.614
on a Bubbles La Roux and her
All-Girl Revue?

09:43.016 --> 09:44.415
Well, I don't know,
look under "La."

09:46.086 --> 09:47.178
All right.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.310
Okay, thanks.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.182
-(doorbell rings)
- Come in.

09:52.959 --> 09:53.983
Look at this, Watson.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.492
It's all here
for the trained eye.

09:55.628 --> 09:56.857
- We're too late for dinner.
- Yeah.

09:56.996 --> 09:59.021
Oh, I'm glad you guys are here.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.030
Fonzie's missing.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.292
I can't find him anywhere.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.924
Big deal, so he's missing
a couple of hours.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.332
Why worry'?

10:04.471 --> 10:07.338
Because of the coffin at the
Heavenly Slumber Funeral Parlor.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.033
I don't think
I want to hear any more.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.973
Fonzie was working on a hearse.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.169
There was a coffin inside.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.837
Inside that
was counterfeit money.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.470
I told you I didn't want
to hear any more.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.105
So Fonzie was gonna
return the hearse,

10:17.250 --> 10:18.945
that's the last I have seen
or heard from him.

10:19.085 --> 10:19.950
He's in big trouble.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.349
All right, you asked for it.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.316
Would you cut it out, Malph?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.948
Gee, I wonder what
Sherlock Holmes would do

10:27.093 --> 10:28.322
in a situation like this.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.452
He'd talk to Dr. Watson
and I'm gonna go find him.

10:30.597 --> 10:31.928
- Malph!
- Ralph...

10:32.065 --> 10:34.227
All right, now listen...

10:34.367 --> 10:35.459
He was gonna
return the hearse, right?

10:35.602 --> 10:36.467
- POTSIE: Yeah.
- Then he was gonna go

10:36.603 --> 10:37.570
straight to the police.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.502
I called the police department,
negative.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.198
That means he never got there.

10:42.408 --> 10:43.739
I called every place
I can think of.

10:43.877 --> 10:44.742
Nothing.

10:44.878 --> 10:45.743
Wait!

10:45.879 --> 10:46.971
Did you call Inspiration Point?

10:47.113 --> 10:48.342
There's no phone
at Inspiration Point.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.846
Exactly!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.712
Elementary, my dear Watson.

10:51.851 --> 10:52.818
Yeah, that really was.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.181
Let's go check it out.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.310
Looks like
it's gonna rain tonight.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.320
(thunder rumbles)

10:56.456 --> 10:57.480
Hey, Malph.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.683
Sell you half my rain insurance
for a dollar.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.363
Listen up--
has anybody seen Fonzie?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.695
EVERYONE:
No.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.132
Oh... I don't know
where else to look, guys.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.203
Well, he's not at the garage,

11:11.337 --> 11:12.600
he's not at Inspiration Point...

11:12.739 --> 11:13.831
Yeah, wasn't that something?

11:13.973 --> 11:16.032
A hundred girls up there,
just waiting for Fonzie.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.302
Pitiful Sight.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.844
Well, you did your best
to console 'em, Malph.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.209
Yeah, I just hope that wasn't
poison ivy they threw me in.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.783
Now do you guys believe me
that Fonzie's missing?

11:24.918 --> 11:25.885
Yeah.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.111
And I don't like
the looks of this, Rich.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.118
All right.
All right.

11:28.254 --> 11:29.983
Let's just follow this path.

11:31.057 --> 11:32.582
Who was the last person
to see Fonzie?

11:32.725 --> 11:33.886
- You were.
- Wrong path.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.426
- So it was you!
- Ralph!

11:35.562 --> 11:36.723
Oh, sorry, Rich.
I'm a little edgy.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.955
All right.
All right.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.395
Now, uh, where did Fonzie
say he was going?

11:40.533 --> 11:41.659
- To deliver the hearse.
- Right.

11:41.801 --> 11:42.996
So the only local conclusion is

11:43.136 --> 11:44.331
he's at the funeral parlor.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.733
Let's not be hasty.
If we talk some more,

11:45.872 --> 11:48.034
I'm sure we can find another
logical conclusion.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.369
Rich, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

11:49.509 --> 11:50.374
Yeah, I'm thinking
Fonzie's in trouble.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.409
I'm thinking he needs our help.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.602
- Yeah!
- And we better check out

11:52.745 --> 11:54.076
this Heavenly Slumber
Funeral Parlor.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.682
- Yeah.
- Ho-ho. Ho-ho!

11:55.815 --> 11:57.249
I'm not going
to any funeral parlor.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.407
Everyone there is dead.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.882
Dead?

12:00.019 --> 12:01.987
And if Fonzie's still there,
he may be.

12:02.121 --> 12:03.589
(thunder cracks, rumbles)

12:06.259 --> 12:07.784
- Dead?
- Dead?

12:15.668 --> 12:17.227
<i>FONZIE: I returned
that hearse, you know.</i>

12:17.370 --> 12:18.701
<i>I took $10, 000--</i>

12:18.838 --> 12:20.135
$5,000 for each fist--

12:20.273 --> 12:22.105
'cause I knew I would need
the evidence, right?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.802
And then I took it
right down to the T-men.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.571
And that's where
I've been ever since.

12:26.713 --> 12:27.737
-(snaps fingers)
- Whoa!

12:27.880 --> 12:28.745
(Marion sighs, gasps)

12:28.881 --> 12:30.280
The T-men?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.474
Treasury men, Marion.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.347
Oh. 10-4, Howard.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.153
You think
you'll get a reward for this?

12:38.291 --> 12:39.486
I don't need a reward.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.287
I'll get it when I get up
to Inspiration Point.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.657
I'm five chicks behind.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.821
Oh, what an ordeal.

12:45.965 --> 12:48.093
This is just like
a James Cagney movie.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.635
(imitates Cagney): Okay, you
dirty rat, you dirty rat.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.794
You dirty rat.

12:54.907 --> 12:55.965
Oh! Five to 9:00.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.133
I made the curfew.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.006
Now, look,
what if these guys know

12:59.145 --> 13:00.909
you took the money
out of the coffin, huh?

13:01.047 --> 13:02.845
Well, who's gonna tell 'em,
the stiff in the coffin?

13:02.982 --> 13:03.881
(laughs)

13:04.017 --> 13:05.678
Home early and nobody cares.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.616
- I care.
- Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.621
Oh, Arthur was just telling us
such an exciting story.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.191
I'm so glad you're home early.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.759
We're home early too,

13:13.893 --> 13:15.793
because your father was caught
cheating at the bridge game.

13:15.928 --> 13:17.396
That's enough, Marion.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.593
Go on, Fonzie.

13:20.733 --> 13:21.996
All right.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.035
So... the T-men said
they'd been hunting these guys

13:24.170 --> 13:25.934
for a long time, you know,
this gang.

13:26.072 --> 13:29.736
And they also said I was
a good citizen, which I knew.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.335
Oh, my goodness.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.071
Counterfeiters in Milwaukee!

13:34.213 --> 13:36.875
Everybody cheats,
don't they, Howard?

13:38.318 --> 13:39.649
I have a question.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.254
Why is there a strange man

13:41.387 --> 13:43.185
hanging around
outside our house?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.758
What?! Let me see...

13:48.828 --> 13:51.263
Hey, there is a guy
hanging around out there.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.798
It's not one of your boyfriends,
though, Joanie.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.458
He's wearing a suit.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.161
What should we do?

13:58.304 --> 13:59.328
Maintain cool.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.633
Be cool, huh?

14:00.773 --> 14:01.865
I'll get him.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.100
Okay. Be cool.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.539
Now, Joanie,
you go to your room.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.577
I'll hold him off.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.006
Marion, that's not being cool.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.048
Save yourselves!

14:11.184 --> 14:12.549
Uh, Mom, I didn't
come home early

14:12.685 --> 14:14.744
to go to my room.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.787
Hey, freeze it!

14:16.923 --> 14:19.415
Hey, look what I found,
an extra large skulker.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.254
Well, if you let me go,
I'll explain.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.657
Who are you, anyway?

14:22.795 --> 14:25.059
Peterson, Treasury Department.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.466
Oh, yeah, he's right.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.036
You can always tell a T-man

14:31.170 --> 14:33.104
'cause they got that
squared-off handkerchief,

14:33.239 --> 14:36.072
you know, and the pointed shoes,
the bland face.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.345
I want to tell you something--
I deeply apologize.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.641
I didn't mean to mug
the government, you know?

14:41.781 --> 14:42.976
Hey, you know, you're not bad.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.948
Where'd you learn
to use your hands like that?

14:45.084 --> 14:46.381
ALL:
Don't ask.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.982
You folks know where I can find
an Arthur Fonzarelli?

14:51.124 --> 14:52.455
Yeah.
Looks like he found you.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.560
Huh, oh, so you're Fonzarelli?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.093
Whoa...

14:56.229 --> 14:58.095
The chief wants you to check out
a couple of mug shots.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.096
JOANIE:
Hmm.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.529
T-men, mug shots--.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.964
Boy, am I glad
I came home early.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.194
Yeah, these are the two guys.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.499
They look very good in stripes.

15:06.639 --> 15:07.765
Just as we suspected.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.898
These two men are working
with a criminal genius.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.737
Head of the counterfeit gang.

15:11.878 --> 15:15.576
A man that is known simply as...
the Candy Man.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.143
ALL:
The Candy Man?

15:18.284 --> 15:20.082
Is that plain or almonds?

15:20.219 --> 15:21.744
(laughing)

15:21.888 --> 15:24.914
He gets his name from his habit
of eating candy all the time.

15:25.057 --> 15:29.085
Well, just because somebody eats
candy all the time doesn't...

15:29.228 --> 15:31.720
Never mind, Marion.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.093
Let me ask you a question:

15:33.232 --> 15:36.725
<i>Have they found this, uh,
terrifying Twinkle'?</i>

15:36.869 --> 15:38.837
Uh, no, but we searched
the funeral parlor

15:38.971 --> 15:40.200
while the Candy Man was out.

15:40.339 --> 15:42.433
Unfortunately, we couldn't find
the printing press.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.236
Without the evidence,
there's no arrest.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.276
Then I should get right on this.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.175
Hey, no!
Now, those men are dangerous.

15:47.313 --> 15:48.747
No telling what they might do.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.645
And whatever you do,
you stay away from them

15:50.783 --> 15:52.877
and the Heavenly Slumber
Funeral Parlor.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.783
(thunder cracks, rumbles)

16:06.766 --> 16:07.892
(cat shrieks)

16:08.034 --> 16:09.798
RICHIE:
Oh, sorry.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.779
Okay...
we've searched everywhere,

16:22.915 --> 16:24.212
so Fonzie's gotta be
in here, right?

16:24.350 --> 16:25.215
POTSIE:
Yeah, right.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.477
RICHIE:
Okay. Fonz?

16:26.619 --> 16:28.815
Fonzie?

16:28.955 --> 16:30.150
Fonzie, you in here?

16:32.091 --> 16:34.219
'Guys...
.l.luh?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.350
Will you stop hanging on me?

16:35.495 --> 16:36.587
I feel like a Siamese triplet.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.663
POTSIE:
Oh. Sorry, Rich.

16:38.798 --> 16:39.663
- Potsie...
- Yeah.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.698
We shouldn't be doing this.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.959
It's bad luck.

16:42.101 --> 16:42.966
What's bad luck?

16:43.102 --> 16:45.002
Anything dangerous.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.866
Will you guys knock it off
and search?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.668
Fonzie could be unconscious
around here somewhere.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.745
Hey, guys!
Get over here!

16:52.879 --> 16:53.744
POTSIE:
What? What?

16:53.880 --> 16:55.814
These look like...

16:55.948 --> 16:56.847
Coffins!

16:56.983 --> 16:58.849
(whimpering)

17:00.386 --> 17:02.514
What'd you expect to see at a
funeral parlor, roller skates?

17:02.655 --> 17:03.679
(whimpering)

17:03.823 --> 17:05.348
But these are full.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.364
(shrieking)

17:13.499 --> 17:14.694
Ralph, take it easy.

17:14.834 --> 17:15.733
Be quiet.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.461
These are just dummies.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.162
They're probably used
for display purposes.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.000
Oh, yeah?
How do you know they're dummies?

17:21.140 --> 17:22.699
Maybe one of them is Dracula.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.942
-(coffin lid bangs shut)
-(Ralph shrieks)

17:26.078 --> 17:27.704
You're letting your imagination
run away with you, Ralph.

17:27.847 --> 17:28.939
There is no such thing
as Dracula.

17:29.081 --> 17:29.946
Right!

17:30.082 --> 17:31.106
That's what they all said.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.218
Then he sucked up
half of Transylvania.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.789
(car doors shutting)

17:37.924 --> 17:39.187
-(thunder rumbling)
- Someone's coming.

17:40.526 --> 17:41.516
Someone's coming.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.628
My life's over.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.856
- Hide! Hide!
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:45.765 --> 17:46.789
Where? Where?

17:46.933 --> 17:48.401
- Wait, I got it. I got an idea.
- What? What?

17:48.534 --> 17:49.899
- Where are we gonna hide?
- Hide in the coffin!

17:50.036 --> 17:50.969
Are you crazy?

17:51.103 --> 17:53.094
I'd rather give myself up.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.968
- What about us?
- I'll give you up too.

17:55.908 --> 17:56.807
They could be killers.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.069
Care to join me in a coffin?

17:58.978 --> 17:59.843
Wait a minute, that's mine.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.208
- Why?
- I don't know.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.147
Hey. guys.
how do you get in a coffin?

18:05.284 --> 18:06.183
It's easy getting in.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.309
Getting out is the hard part.

18:07.453 --> 18:08.477
(laughs)

18:08.621 --> 18:10.749
Even in panic,
I've still got it, huh?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.988
- Ready.
- All right, okay, get in, guys.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.122
(thunder rumbling)

18:21.100 --> 18:23.398
- Okay, guys, here we go.
- POTSIE: All right.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.436
RALPH:
This could be the death of me.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.167
Would you open the lid, dummy?

18:28.307 --> 18:30.105
Do we keep our eyes
opened or closed?

18:30.242 --> 18:31.732
- Get down.
- Closed.

18:31.877 --> 18:32.935
RALPH:
Get down.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.945
(thunder crashes)

18:49.261 --> 18:53.129
You've got to stop
being so big, Eugene.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.227
Now, I thought I heard
something, Eugene.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.894
Ah, you're always hearing
something.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.061
Well, I guess you're right.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.104
Eugene!

19:00.239 --> 19:01.866
Look at these, Eugene.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.567
The Candy Man
must have gotten these.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.074
Yeah, they look awful.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.076
This one's all soft.

19:06.212 --> 19:07.509
STICKY:
Mmm.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.445
Oh, Eugene...

19:09.582 --> 19:12.813
look at the face
on this one, Eugene.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.545
Yeah, he looks scared.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.553
(both laughing)

19:17.957 --> 19:20.289
Yeah, now I know why
they call 'em dummies.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.424
Eugene, Eugene...

19:26.332 --> 19:28.300
I don't like these dummies.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.095
Let's throw them in the furnace.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.601
(Sticky laughs)

19:31.737 --> 19:34.798
(thunder crashes)

19:34.940 --> 19:37.773
Yeah, the new ones make pretty
colors when they burn.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.207
(both laughing)

19:41.814 --> 19:42.781
(cat screeches)

19:42.915 --> 19:45.748
(Candy Man laughs)

19:45.885 --> 19:46.875
Good news.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.248
No cavities.

19:48.387 --> 19:49.980
No.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.521
- Detroit called.
- STICKY: Detroit called.

19:57.663 --> 19:58.755
CAN DY MAN:
Yes.

19:58.898 --> 19:59.831
They want a shipment
of $20 bills

19:59.965 --> 20:01.330
sent over immediately.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.493
Now, the bad news.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.900
You're out of candy.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.335
No!

20:07.473 --> 20:10.602
- Chicago called.
- STICKY: Chicago called.

20:10.743 --> 20:11.801
CANDY MAN:
This morning's shipment

20:11.944 --> 20:13.503
we sent out on the hearse
was 10,000 short.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.511
STICKY:
Oh!

20:14.647 --> 20:17.082
- Licorice whip.
- Licorice whip.

20:18.517 --> 20:21.043
- Oh... oh-ho... oh...
- Argh!

20:21.187 --> 20:22.552
Now...

20:22.688 --> 20:23.621
which one of you took it?

20:23.756 --> 20:24.985
Not me, Candy Man.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.250
(grunts)
Me neither, boss.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.257
Then who did?

20:27.393 --> 20:29.259
And you had better talk fast.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.487
Not with that.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.223
- You better tell him, Sticky.
- Shh-shh-shh!

20:33.365 --> 20:35.299
Tell me what?

20:35.434 --> 20:37.994
Well, well, there was
a mechanical difficulty

20:38.137 --> 20:40.231
with the hearse,
so we sent for a mechanic

20:40.372 --> 20:41.362
and he came and picked it up...

20:41.507 --> 20:42.941
- With that coffin in it?
- Yes!

20:43.075 --> 20:44.440
EUGENE: Well, we thought
it'd be okay, Candy Man.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.806
CANDY MAN:
You fools!

20:45.945 --> 20:49.313
Well, then, it must be the
mechanic who took the money.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.938
And I know his name, Candy Man.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.482
- What?
- It's Fonzarelli.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.347
We take care of that Fonzarelli.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.750
Tonight!

20:55.888 --> 20:57.822
-(thunder rumbles)
-(cat screeches)

20:57.957 --> 21:00.016
Then we dispose of that cat.

21:01.393 --> 21:02.861
They haven't got Fonzie.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.326
But they're about to.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.158
- I gotta warn him.
- POTSIE: Yeah.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.459
RALPH:
I'm not gonna make it.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.227
The blood's leaving my head.
I'm gonna faint.

21:10.236 --> 21:11.362
Potsie, you take care of Ralph.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.699
We better split up.
It's better that way.

21:12.838 --> 21:13.930
I'm going to
Fonzie's apartment now.

21:14.073 --> 21:14.938
POTSIE:
All right, Rich. Okay.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.064
Come on, Malph.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.135
<i>“Mph!</i>

21:19.278 --> 21:20.336
Buddy!

21:20.479 --> 21:21.344
Malphie!

21:21.480 --> 21:22.345
-(thunder rumbles)
Malph!

21:22.481 --> 21:23.744
- Pots?
- Yeah.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.977
- Stop shaking my head.
- Oh.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.586
Sorry, Malph,
but come on, let's go.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.687
All right,
give me a minute.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.311
My whole life is
flashing before my eyes,

21:30.456 --> 21:31.855
and I'm just getting
to the good part.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.121
All right,
but will you hurry up?

21:34.260 --> 21:36.319
Hey, you know, Malph, if they
catch you in that coffin,

21:36.462 --> 21:38.055
you're never gonna get out.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.596
- Pots?
- Yeah, Malph?

21:41.267 --> 21:44.066
When we get home, I'm gonna buy
some satin sheets.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.103
This is very comfortable.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.937
(Yawn s)

21:50.643 --> 21:52.338
Oh, Pots,
I feel pretty good now.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.946
Let's get out of here.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.171
Sheesh.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.179
Hope I don't see you
for a while.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.215
Oh, Ralph!

21:58.350 --> 21:59.818
Hey!

22:01.921 --> 22:03.150
Pots?

22:03.289 --> 22:04.950
Potsie?

22:05.090 --> 22:06.421
Where'd you go?

22:06.559 --> 22:07.492
Aw, come on, Pots.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.116
Quit clowning around!
Not in here.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.188
Oh, no... he left me alone.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.031
My parents never left me alone.

22:16.702 --> 22:18.033
What am I gonna do?
I don't know what to do.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.036
Watch... all right,
you gotta relax, Ralph.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.037
Get a grip on yourself.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.231
Just take a deep breath.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.473
There...

22:24.610 --> 22:26.408
(Ralph shrieking)

22:27.746 --> 22:28.736
Ralphie?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.546
Mommy!

22:34.253 --> 22:36.244
Potsie!

22:43.562 --> 22:44.688
'Ralph?
.l.luh?

22:44.830 --> 22:45.820
- Run!
- At least!

22:48.701 --> 22:49.896
Intruders!

22:50.035 --> 22:52.902
No, no, we're just
a couple of coffin thieves

22:53.038 --> 22:54.437
and you caught us, so why don't
you call the police?

22:54.573 --> 22:55.438
Yeah.

22:55.574 --> 22:57.770
- I think not.
- He thinks not.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.742
I have other plans for you.

22:59.879 --> 23:00.937
Hey...

23:01.080 --> 23:02.206
Don't you worry, Malph.

23:02.348 --> 23:03.645
There's two of us.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.409
He's so fat, what can he do?

23:05.551 --> 23:07.417
(laughs)

23:07.553 --> 23:08.952
(thunder crashes)

23:11.690 --> 23:12.885
What can he do?

23:13.025 --> 23:14.891
Don't worry, Malph,
Richie got away.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.927
He's probably
looking for us right now.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.461
- Shut up.
- What do you mean?

23:18.597 --> 23:20.156
(muffled grumbling)

23:23.502 --> 23:25.061
Mom! Dad!

23:25.204 --> 23:26.103
I'm looking for Fonzie.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.103
He's not in his apartment.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.502
Have you seen him?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.939
Yes, dear, Arthur said he was
going down to the garage.

23:31.076 --> 23:31.975
The garage? Okay.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.205
L-I gotta go find him.
I gotta get him.

23:34.346 --> 23:35.575
We're in big trouble.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.808
(thunder rumbling)

23:37.950 --> 23:40.044
He is getting so hyper.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.694
(turns off engine)

24:09.782 --> 24:11.773
(tires screeching)

24:14.520 --> 24:15.510
Fonzie!

24:17.790 --> 24:18.655
Fonzie!

24:18.791 --> 24:20.281
(explosion thundering)

24:20.426 --> 24:22.258
