01:10.200 --> 01:12.239
This is only for ticket-holders,

01:12.240 --> 01:14.679
I'm afraid, those that
are on this list.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.159
It's not for the public.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.759
Can you move along, please?

01:17.760 --> 01:19.039
Follow the signs.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.159
No, I think you'll find
we're on the list.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.719
All of us.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.519
Every year, this happens.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.884
Can I see all your
names, please, sir?

01:31.920 --> 01:34.639
Your names are on the list, yes.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.719
We may pass, may we?

01:36.720 --> 01:39.539
I told you it was all in order.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.975
Let's hope the champagne
is better than last year.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.131
There you are, darling.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.720
Cheers.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.599
Where did Sasha go?

02:15.600 --> 02:18.159
I didn't see.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.919
I thought he was right behind me.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.599
He can't have got far.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.039
Sasha?

02:23.040 --> 02:24.959
You've lost someone?

02:24.960 --> 02:27.799
My son Sasha.
He was right here with us.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.359
Well, he's only eight and he
doesn't know his way around here.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.799
He must be outside.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.359
Maybe he's gone to see the horses.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.039
They like to be near to the horses.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.519
Sasha? Sasha?

02:38.520 --> 02:40.119
Excuse me.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.760
- Sasha?
- Sasha!

02:52.400 --> 02:54.159
Sasha!

02:54.160 --> 02:56.800
Sasha? Sasha!

02:58.400 --> 03:00.759
Are you lost, young man?

03:00.760 --> 03:02.799
Would you like a piece of cake?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.519
No, I don't want any cake, sir.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.999
- Is that the truth?
- It is the truth, sir.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.319
- I have a stomach-ache, sir.
- Because they'll never know,

03:10.320 --> 03:11.999
I promise you.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.439
I must go now, sir.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.519
Well, if we meet again, young man,

03:15.520 --> 03:17.239
let me tell you,

03:17.240 --> 03:20.422
I'm not nearly as fierce as I look.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.440
Sasha!

03:23.720 --> 03:26.999
- Excuse me, have you seen a little boy?
- Sasha!

03:27.000 --> 03:28.959
Sasha!

03:28.960 --> 03:30.759
Sasha?

03:30.760 --> 03:32.479
- Sasha!
- A blue jacket...

03:32.480 --> 03:34.919
Sasha?

03:34.920 --> 03:36.375
- Sasha?
- Sasha!

03:38.600 --> 03:40.839
Sasha?

03:40.840 --> 03:42.119
Are you Sasha?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.440
Yes.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.239
I've found him! He's here!

03:48.240 --> 03:49.919
Sasha!

03:49.920 --> 03:53.999
Where have you been?
I've been so worried about you!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.839
Thank you for finding him.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.799
Where have you been, Sashenka?
Really!

03:57.800 --> 03:59.399
Never, ever run off like that!

03:59.400 --> 04:01.759
You must allow us
to say a proper thank you.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.999
Please join us for our
picnic after the races.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.199
No, please,
that's really not necessary.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.928
No, no, please, I must insist.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.639
They won't come.
They aren't going to come.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.999
Yes, they will.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.546
Who wouldn't want to tuck into all
this?

04:19.279 --> 04:20.918
Welcome!

04:22.520 --> 04:24.279
- This is my husband, Richard.
- How do you do?

04:24.280 --> 04:27.079
I think I recognise you.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.719
Are you Richard Shaw?

04:28.720 --> 04:30.319
Yes, I am!

04:30.320 --> 04:31.639
Well, this is thrilling.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.879
Absolutely thrilling to meet you!
Samuel Petrukhin.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.679
And this is my family, and that is
Courtney Johnson and Mr Neath.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.319
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.879
- Cheers!
- Sasha, isn't that a thing?

04:42.880 --> 04:45.839
Mr Shaw was a great hero during
the war. You must read his book.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.279
Please, you're giving me
far too much of a write-up!

04:48.280 --> 04:49.799
Don't you believe all that.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.839
Your father is exaggerating wildly.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.639
Nonsense! Here is
a real hero, Sasha.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.679
We come here every year.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.119
Miriam gets tickets
because of her family.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.799
Miriam comes from a
rather aristocratic family.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.800
Jewish aristocracy.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.839
They'd be able to eavesdrop
a lot more efficiently

05:08.840 --> 05:10.199
if they had a better hearing aid.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.119
We make hearing aids, you see.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.239
You make hearing aids?
How interesting. -

05:14.240 --> 05:16.399
Manytone Electrics.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.919
Sasha, why are you slouching
like that? Sit up straight!

05:18.920 --> 05:21.839
Sasha is going to
boarding school in three weeks.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.599
- Marlham House.
- Really?

05:23.600 --> 05:24.919
Marlham House?

05:24.920 --> 05:26.679
So you've heard of it?

05:26.680 --> 05:29.199
Yes. It's a very good school.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.599
He's so young. They go away
so young these days, don't they?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.080
Sasha? Sasha?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.079
Have you hurt yourself?

05:38.080 --> 05:41.319
- Sasha, what's happening?
- Where does it hurt, darling?

05:41.320 --> 05:44.119
- What's wrong?
- It may be his appendix. If it bursts...

05:44.120 --> 05:46.839
We've got to get him to a hospital.
I'll take him in my car.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.279
It'll be much the
quickest thing to do.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.826
Make way, please!

05:57.120 --> 05:59.484
Hannah, you go with Peter.

06:12.520 --> 06:16.159
Dr Appleby, Dr Appleby to
the maternity ward immediately, please.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.679
I need a doctor in Bay 9.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.079
- It is an emer...
- Urgent call for Dr T Rogers

06:21.080 --> 06:23.039
to proceed to Theatre 3.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.799
Dr T Rogers to Theatre 3.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.999
What's the hold-up?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.319
There is another emergency,

06:27.320 --> 06:30.119
We just need to wait for
this announcement to finish.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.839
To Theatre 1 urgently,
please. This is an urgent call

06:32.840 --> 06:37.719
for Dr Peters to proceed to
Theatre 1, please. Thank you.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.239
We will be next.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.877
I assure you we will be next.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.199
Dr Sefton, Dr Sefton is required

06:44.200 --> 06:47.110
in the X-ray department at once.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.640
This is truly absurd.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.199
This could be done so much better.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.799
Calling a doctor like this!

06:55.800 --> 06:58.319
Dr Michael, Dr Michael
to the maternity ward.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.839
We're still waiting for a doctor!

06:59.840 --> 07:02.239
I repeat, this is
an urgent call for Dr Michael

07:02.240 --> 07:04.439
to the maternity ward immediately.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.799
I need a doctor in Bay
9 immediately.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.479
That is immediately, please.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.208
It will happen now.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.600
Well, where is it?

07:25.360 --> 07:27.519
Doctor!

07:27.520 --> 07:29.000
Doctor!

07:30.400 --> 07:33.037
I need you to see my son now!

07:34.520 --> 07:38.066
Sasha, everything
will be all right now!

07:40.200 --> 07:43.200
It's madness, doing it like this.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.759
The American Air
Force has announced a nuclear device

07:59.760 --> 08:02.519
was dropped accidentally
on a farmhouse

08:02.520 --> 08:04.639
in Mars Bluff, South Carolina,

08:04.640 --> 08:07.079
but since the bomb did not,
on this occasion,

08:07.080 --> 08:08.879
contain its nuclear core,

08:08.880 --> 08:11.159
there was no major explosion.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.639
Six people are
reported injured, though.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.839
This is the second incident
involving a nuclear device

08:16.840 --> 08:18.679
- being dropped accidentally...
- Blimey!

08:18.680 --> 08:21.319
In the United States
in the last two months,

08:21.320 --> 08:25.079
after a hydrogen bomb was lost in
the sea near Savannah, Georgia.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.559
Please let me not do it.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.558
Please, please don't make me do it.

08:33.559 --> 08:34.879
Sasha!

08:34.880 --> 08:37.679
You're lucky you don't have
to go to boarding school.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.770
I'd do anything not to have to go.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.159
Well, you've managed to miss all
this time because of your appendix.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.399
And at least it's a
very smart uniform.

08:49.400 --> 08:53.119
Why can't I go to the
local school like you did?

08:53.120 --> 08:54.559
It's not fair!

08:54.560 --> 08:56.439
It's not fair, no.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.559
But then you're the boy,
and that's what happens.

08:59.560 --> 09:03.479
So, as we won't be all together
again for a few weeks at least,

09:03.480 --> 09:06.239
it has given me a chance
to open this sherry -

09:06.240 --> 09:08.479
the finest sherry we have, in fact.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.359
You can have some too,
Sasha, a few sips.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.279
And then we have a real
banquet to tuck into.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.719
Your mother has prepared
a wonderful goodbye meal.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.439
So, Sasha,

09:19.440 --> 09:21.759
if there is anything
you want to ask,

09:21.760 --> 09:25.119
or feel that we should discuss...

09:25.120 --> 09:26.879
Yes, Hannah?

09:26.880 --> 09:30.039
I don't want to do it. Please.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.559
Don't make me do it.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.879
I don't want to do this season,

09:32.880 --> 09:34.039
I don't want to be a deb,

09:34.040 --> 09:36.839
and I definitely don't want to
go to a horrible etiquette class.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.359
Hannah!

09:38.360 --> 09:40.559
This is certainly
not the time, Hannah.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.439
This is Sasha's celebratory meal.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.039
But let us be very clear.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.719
You most definitely are going
to do it. It is your birthright.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.039
No!

09:48.040 --> 09:49.759
Your mother was presented at Court,

09:49.760 --> 09:51.999
and that gives you the
right to be so, too.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.599
And we would be absolutely
mad to give up that chance,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.759
especially as this is
the last-ever season

09:56.760 --> 09:59.119
where the debutantes are
being presented to the Queen.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.393
The very last time,
and you will be one of them!

10:13.040 --> 10:14.919
So you're awake.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.239
Very much so, Dad, yes.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.079
It's very late, my dear.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.039
You know they
dropped a nuclear bomb

10:21.040 --> 10:23.759
by mistake in America,
on a farmhouse?

10:23.760 --> 10:26.519
I know, but nobody was killed.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.975
You mustn't dwell, my dear.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.759
And don't worry - they can't go
off by mistake, these bombs.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.760
- They can't?
- They really can't.

10:38.920 --> 10:42.799
And the season will be a
wonderful time, I'm sure.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.039
You need to do this for your mum.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.768
It's a reminder of her family.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.039
Before she married me.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.799
I'm so sorry, I don't
have an appointment,

11:01.800 --> 11:04.079
but I wonder if it's possible to
have a minute or two

11:04.080 --> 11:05.439
with Mr Petrukhin. My name is...

11:05.440 --> 11:08.713
There's a lady here
to see Mr Samuel.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.640
Can I help you?

11:15.560 --> 11:17.480
It's you!

11:19.120 --> 11:20.479
Yes, it's me!

11:20.480 --> 11:21.919
I wasn't sure you'd remember me.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.439
Of course I remember you.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.639
And I'm so pleased to see you
after our picnic ended so abruptly.

11:26.640 --> 11:29.359
He's fully recovered,
I hope, your son?

11:29.360 --> 11:31.599
Yes, it was his appendix,

11:31.600 --> 11:33.119
and out it came!

11:33.120 --> 11:35.119
What can I do for you, Mrs Shaw?

11:35.120 --> 11:38.239
Yes. I'm so sorry just
appearing like this,

11:38.240 --> 11:41.159
but I remembered you said
you make hearing aids.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.199
Because I have a very deaf aunt

11:43.200 --> 11:46.479
who always refuses to wear
any kind of hearing aid,

11:46.480 --> 11:47.639
and I thought if -

11:47.640 --> 11:52.279
I could find something small enough,
something tiny enough -

11:52.280 --> 11:54.959
I might persuade her
to change her mind.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.779
We can do that, yes.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.479
Many of the people here are deaf.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.839
Not all, but a lot of them.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.204
They're very good workers.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.039
So, this is our latest model.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.999
It's just come out, and I hope it
will be tiny enough for your aunt.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.679
I might really stand a chance
of persuading her to wear that.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.999
I'll try to get her to come
the next time I'm in town.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.799
Or if she prefers, we can always
come to wherever she is, of course.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.519
- I'm sure that's too much trouble.
- No, not in the slightest.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.319
We do that for some of our clients.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.039
We do Winston Churchill's hearing
aid, for instance...

12:36.040 --> 12:37.439
You do? Winston Churchill?

12:37.440 --> 12:38.999
Yes, we've done it for years.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.319
When he was Prime Minister
in Downing Street,

12:41.320 --> 12:43.319
although that was
stopped for a short time,

12:43.320 --> 12:44.839
for a reason I never discovered.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.759
But now all is forgiven,
we see him regularly.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.799
Well, I'm impressed.

12:49.800 --> 12:54.159
Doing Sir Winston
Churchill's hearing aid!

12:54.160 --> 12:56.319
Mr Johnson, who you've met already,

12:56.320 --> 12:59.719
and this is Doreen, who keeps
us all on track - especially me.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.319
I try to, anyhow.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.959
I'm sure you must be kept very busy

13:02.960 --> 13:04.919
supplying all these
important people.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.839
The trick, of course, is
to get them to pay up -

13:07.840 --> 13:10.159
often the bigger the title,
the slower they are.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.279
Now, I must show you this -

13:12.280 --> 13:14.799
it's our very latest product.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.959
What is it? I've never seen
something like this before.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.239
Very few people have.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.359
We hope! We think we're the first.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.719
- In the world?
- Yes, it's entirely new.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.199
It's a staff-locator,
for calling people.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.319
You wear it in your top pocket,
and it goes off, it bleeps,

13:29.320 --> 13:31.079
when somebody needs you.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.639
It finds you regardless of
where you are in a building.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.839
It will be especially
useful in hospitals.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.599
We were developing it anyway,

13:37.600 --> 13:39.279
but after my experience with my son,

13:39.280 --> 13:41.159
that day in the
emergency department,

13:41.160 --> 13:42.959
it gave us extra urgency.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.919
Well, I'm sure it
will change everything.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.648
Well, one order would be nice!

13:56.360 --> 13:58.319
You must be Petrukhin.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.959
So you've decided to join
us after all, have you?

14:01.960 --> 14:06.559
Now, Petrukhin, Mr Tezler has
just a few questions to ask you.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.039
Your height?

14:09.960 --> 14:11.439
Your height?

14:11.440 --> 14:13.719
3ft 9in, I think, sir.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.279
How big are your feet?

14:15.280 --> 14:16.679
I'm not sure, sir.

14:16.680 --> 14:20.044
You don't know?
Give Matron your shoe.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.159
Religion?

14:25.160 --> 14:26.959
Jewish, sir.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.119
Yes! You're the only
one, as it happens.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.719
At least the only one we know about.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.599
Your father's profession?

14:33.600 --> 14:37.079
He makes hearing aids
and he also invents things.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.599
Electrical things.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.919
Lots of things, sir.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.799
- An inventor?
- He is,

14:41.800 --> 14:45.279
and he doesn't just invent
them, he sells them as well.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.559
Now, Petrukhin, as you
weren't with us last term,

14:48.560 --> 14:51.119
you have, of course,
missed certain things -

14:51.120 --> 14:53.479
so you're going to need to
do your best to catch up.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.359
But no doubt, since your
father is an inventor,

14:56.360 --> 15:01.815
you have lively thoughts going
on up here already, Petrukhin.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.559
Here they are,
the darkie and the Jew!

15:07.560 --> 15:10.079
Never be allowed here
except to do this.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.919
Let's see if I can get a free trial

15:11.920 --> 15:14.439
on this new one they're
going to give me today.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.879
Usually works!

15:18.680 --> 15:22.159
So, Mr Richardson, here we
are with a new hearing aid

15:22.160 --> 15:23.799
and, as good as the old one is,

15:23.800 --> 15:26.199
I'm sure you will notice
a very considerable difference.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.119
What? What did you say?

15:28.120 --> 15:30.159
Can't hear a word you're saying!

15:30.160 --> 15:32.719
Is your... Is your
hearing aid turned on?

15:32.720 --> 15:36.448
Can't hear a damn thing.
What's he saying?

15:37.880 --> 15:39.759
I'm only joking, of course!

15:39.760 --> 15:42.079
Got you there! Ha-ha!

15:42.080 --> 15:43.519
Forgive, I couldn't resist.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.439
Must be this rather
excellent brandy.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.599
Bloody good today.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.719
Now, this new one,
this new hearing aid,

15:48.720 --> 15:50.679
will be a great
deal better, will it?

15:50.680 --> 15:52.279
It is even better.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.959
Will it come with a free trial?

15:53.960 --> 15:56.399
A new hearing aid should come
with a free trial - after all,

15:56.400 --> 15:59.719
I might prefer the old one,
and you're going to take that away.

15:59.720 --> 16:03.679
So shall we say a normal
six months' free trial?

16:03.680 --> 16:06.399
There's no free trial, sir.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.119
This is our latest model,

16:09.120 --> 16:11.079
and there's no free trial, sir.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.199
This has never happened before.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.879
This is not the sort
of service I expect.

16:15.880 --> 16:22.062
It might not be wise to change the
way you do business, Mr Petrukhin.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.479
Yes, I forgot.

16:24.480 --> 16:28.390
With this new model,
there is no free trial.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.319
My God.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.775
How am I going to
get through tomorrow?

17:08.560 --> 17:11.833
I've got to stop talking to my fish.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.919
Now, there's only one
important thing -

17:17.920 --> 17:20.719
make sure that you're in
Miss Laidlaw's class.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.079
It's the one that I've paid for,

17:22.079 --> 17:24.159
it's the most expensive,
she's the top teacher.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.679
Make sure that you're with her.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.358
Don't let them put you
in another class.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.039
Promise me.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.479
Dad, she's not going to be able to
turn me into something I'm not.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.279
Especially in just a few weeks.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.119
Don't worry, my dear. Look at me!

17:36.120 --> 17:37.919
I taught myself how to speak

17:37.920 --> 17:41.159
with a perfect English
upper-class accent.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.342
Nobody can tell the difference now!

17:51.000 --> 17:52.546
That's very good.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.880
Prepare.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.240
Hello.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.319
I'm sorry I'm late.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.359
May I still join you? Why not?

18:14.360 --> 18:17.199
I have space, as you can see.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.599
Your name?

18:18.600 --> 18:20.199
Hannah Petrukhin.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.399
You're sure you're meant to be in
this class, though,

18:22.400 --> 18:25.079
- not Miss Laidlaw's?
- No, I'm meant to be in this class.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.759
Absolutely!

18:26.760 --> 18:29.799
Blimey! Never seen
such nervous faces.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.919
It's not advanced physics
we're about to do here.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.479
So, we were about to
start with the curtsey.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.039
Legs like so.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.495
And the curtsey.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.079
Not ridiculously low,

18:42.080 --> 18:44.439
nor an off-hand little dip.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.713
Not too low, not too low!

18:57.480 --> 19:00.039
We need orders.
We need a lot more orders.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.519
And we need to start saving money.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.279
We need to cut back
in certain areas,

19:03.280 --> 19:05.599
because the situation is
becoming extremely perilous.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.639
"Perilous!" Don't use that word
ever, Courtney,

19:08.640 --> 19:10.599
the situation is not perilous.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.239
It is far from perilous.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.479
The launch of the staff-locator
will bring in new orders.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.439
It will make a huge difference.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.759
We can't bank on that taking
off at once, we really can't.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.999
And in the meantime,
we really do need to start doing

19:22.000 --> 19:24.519
a few things differently,
Mr Samuel. Such as?

19:24.520 --> 19:26.359
Well, I can think of
one thing straight away.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.119
We can't afford a chauffeur for you
paid for by the company any more.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.079
It's not for me!
It's to impress the clients

19:31.080 --> 19:32.839
when we go and fit their hearing
aids.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.599
I am definitely not sacking Peter!

19:34.600 --> 19:37.519
- It's completely out of the question.
- Then he can do deliveries.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.279
We need another delivery driver
because we've just lost somebody.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.479
And he can chauffeur for you
on special occasions.

19:42.480 --> 19:46.299
Will you agree to that
at least, Mr Samuel?

19:48.240 --> 19:49.440
Thank you.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.599
That's perfectly timed.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.999
We have another order,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.910
and one that I was very much
hoping would come through.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.819
Doing this without a
driver, without Peter!

20:10.360 --> 20:12.997
It's almost like we're naked.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.359
What an absolutely beautiful house.

20:55.360 --> 20:59.479
The sort of house I've always
dreamed of having, Courtney.

20:59.480 --> 21:03.753
Once the staff-locator
takes off, then... maybe!

21:03.920 --> 21:07.239
Here are the gentlemen who are going
to fit your hearing aid, Aunt Mary.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.239
Are they indeed?

21:09.240 --> 21:12.479
Is it as small as they
said it was going to be,

21:12.480 --> 21:15.480
as microscopic as I was promised?

21:17.240 --> 21:19.960
I think so, yes.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.759
Possibly it is.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.799
If nobody notices it,

21:25.800 --> 21:27.759
I might just wear it.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.319
Only do get on with it, please,

21:29.320 --> 21:32.593
I've been worried
about this all day.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.199
You're having a party.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.759
We're not interrupting, are we?

21:35.760 --> 21:37.999
No, no, don't worry about them.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.839
There are always people here -

21:39.840 --> 21:42.519
my husband is Member of Parliament
for this part of the world,

21:42.520 --> 21:44.599
so we always seem to
be entertaining somebody.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.559
There. All done!

21:49.320 --> 21:51.230
That is a difference.

21:52.360 --> 21:55.079
A most dramatic difference, in fact!

21:55.080 --> 21:58.599
There is a volume
control right here.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.359
It is the first-ever hearing aid
to have a volume control, in fact.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.639
And now you can hear
all the awful things

22:04.640 --> 22:06.319
we say about you all the time!

22:06.320 --> 22:08.719
That's the least of my worries.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.799
I'm going to have to make small
talk. How on Earth do I do that?

22:12.800 --> 22:16.079
It's so good to see you again,
Mr Petrukhin. And you, too.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.159
I must thank you gentlemen so much

22:18.160 --> 22:20.639
for coming all this way to do this.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.079
What a special service.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.119
No, no, it's a pleasure
to see this house.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.599
And this garden!

22:25.600 --> 22:29.119
Well, you must come back with your
wife and children one day, to visit.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.959
To see it properly.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.599
It's the least we can do,
after you've come all this way.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.839
Absolutely.
Thank you, that is most kind.

22:36.840 --> 22:39.659
That would be a treat for them.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.240
Well...

22:43.360 --> 22:46.088
we wish you good listening.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.600
Courtney?

22:57.400 --> 23:00.319
Of course. I quite forgot.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.879
I'm so sorry. How idiotic of me!

23:02.880 --> 23:04.639
I must write you a cheque.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.040
Immediately.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.979
Very bold, Courtney.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.779
Just standing there!

23:13.200 --> 23:15.279
It worked, didn't it?

23:15.280 --> 23:17.040
We got the cheque.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.197
What's the matter?

23:24.560 --> 23:27.470
I think that car's following us.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.999
"Following us"? Are you sure?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.799
It was behind us when
we got to the house

23:31.800 --> 23:33.879
and now it's here, following us.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.119
And it's definitely the same car?

23:36.120 --> 23:37.480
Definitely.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.159
Speed up, Courtney.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.797
What the hell are they doing?

23:53.240 --> 23:55.879
It must be one of our competitors.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.719
They follow us all the way here
to see us fit a hearing aid?

23:58.720 --> 24:00.159
That's not likely, is it?

24:00.160 --> 24:01.559
Stop the car, Courtney.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.360
- Stop?
- Yes, stop!

24:10.520 --> 24:13.157
It's about the staff-locator.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.799
They know we're about to launch,

24:14.800 --> 24:18.039
about to do our demonstration
at St Edward's Hospital.

24:18.040 --> 24:22.222
They're not going to
let us out of their sight.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.960
Come on, you bastards!

24:43.320 --> 24:44.639
Come on!

24:44.640 --> 24:47.186
Get out and show yourselves!

24:59.520 --> 25:02.975
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

25:03.680 --> 25:05.719
Did you get a look at them?

25:05.720 --> 25:08.799
No, I didn't.

25:08.800 --> 25:12.159
Well, whoever they are,
we saw them off.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.079
You have your own
private radio, I see.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.159
Yes, sir.
Did anybody tell you that was permitted?

25:40.160 --> 25:42.639
That was allowed at this school?

25:42.640 --> 25:44.679
I didn't think it
was forbidden, sir.

25:44.680 --> 25:47.119
That is not what I asked you.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.399
Nobody told you that
was allowed, did they?

25:50.400 --> 25:53.519
It is, of course, forbidden.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.159
What a cacophony it would be

25:55.160 --> 25:58.159
if everybody were allowed
to have their own radio!

25:58.160 --> 26:01.839
What would that be like,
Petrukhin? It would be hell!

26:01.840 --> 26:03.400
For everyone!

26:04.640 --> 26:06.199
Nobody else, I'm sure,

26:06.200 --> 26:08.559
has a pair of these.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.679
Who has a pair of these at home?

26:11.680 --> 26:14.759
Whose parents has a pair of these?

26:14.760 --> 26:17.039
So you see, Petrukhin,

26:17.040 --> 26:18.599
you are quite alone.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.959
My father could get some of
these for anybody who wanted.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.559
You try to do business?

26:24.560 --> 26:25.879
At school?

26:25.880 --> 26:27.839
You try to sell me goods?

26:27.840 --> 26:29.759
No, not really, sir, I...

26:29.760 --> 26:31.679
Stand up!

26:31.680 --> 26:33.639
These are, of course, confiscated,

26:33.640 --> 26:35.359
as is the radio.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.039
Do you have any other
electrical appliances with you?

26:38.040 --> 26:39.759
Something we don't know about?

26:39.760 --> 26:41.599
Any of your father's inventions?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.999
Something hidden in your luggage?

26:44.000 --> 26:47.359
Be very careful to answer
truthfully, Petrukhin.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.360
No, sir, I haven't anything else.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.959
My goodness, Samuel.
It takes up the whole room!

26:59.960 --> 27:02.919
When you said a new television,
I didn't realise...

27:02.920 --> 27:04.319
Hannah!

27:04.320 --> 27:07.359
You see, it has these
doors that close.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.679
And then it blends
in perfectly, you see?

27:09.680 --> 27:11.039
But it's so big!

27:11.040 --> 27:13.079
I feel it'll be watching
me the whole time.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.439
Let's get it working.

27:14.440 --> 27:16.759
- It takes a while to warm up.
- Dad?

27:16.760 --> 27:19.159
That's the biggest television
I've ever seen!

27:19.160 --> 27:20.719
Yes, yes, but it has doors.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.399
Fits the room!

27:22.400 --> 27:25.039
It must've been very expensive, Dad.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.319
No need to worry
about that, my dear.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.599
More rockets.

27:29.600 --> 27:33.439
Always there's another
rocket at the moment.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.879
I hope I can get used to it.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.599
I prefer the newspaper.

27:36.600 --> 27:40.119
Everything doesn't seem so
chaotic when one reads about it.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.719
Mum is right.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.439
There's always another
rocket at the moment.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.279
But this is a good one, my dear,

27:46.280 --> 27:48.719
it's taking a communication
satellite into space.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.639
It could lead to
all sorts of things happening.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.559
No need to be
frightened of this one.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.159
I'm not frightened of it.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.639
I don't go round being scared
of things all the time.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.199
Except the etiquette class.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.291
Except that, of course.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.039
You look splendid, Mary.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.599
You really do.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.759
And you'll be able to hear

28:10.760 --> 28:12.839
one of Richard's
speeches clearly, for once!

28:12.840 --> 28:15.279
And all the applause, of course.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.959
Maybe a cheer or two.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.919
You're expecting cheers?

28:18.920 --> 28:21.919
They're usually too old
to make any noise at all.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.039
And they'd probably die of shock

28:24.040 --> 28:27.495
if anyone under 30
was in the audience.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.839
Are you all right, my dear?

28:30.840 --> 28:32.599
Yes, of course I am.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.759
I'm excited we're
going out together.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.719
Everybody ready, then?

28:37.720 --> 28:40.266
I'm going to be sensational.

28:43.240 --> 28:46.479
Amazing to see you here, Mary.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.679
I was told that you never go out
these days.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.479
Whoever told you that was lying.

28:50.480 --> 28:54.200
I am very selective, I admit.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.999
I am here to support Richard.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.559
- What are you doing here?
- The same as you, naturally.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.199
I rarely miss a speech of Richard's.

29:04.200 --> 29:09.239
Welcome, everybody. And a splendid
turnout, I think we'd all agree,

29:09.240 --> 29:11.679
despite the comparative
lateness of the hour.

29:11.680 --> 29:14.119
And you will be
particularly thrilled

29:14.120 --> 29:16.279
to hear that I don't intend
to say anything myself.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.719
Because I want, without further ado,

29:19.720 --> 29:21.999
to get to our star attraction.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.280
Our distinguished
Member of Parliament...

29:29.360 --> 29:32.199
Well, I was about to say let's give
a warm welcome to Mr Shaw.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.679
He was here just a moment ago.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.680
Is he among any of you out there?

29:38.480 --> 29:39.840
Mr Shaw?

29:41.120 --> 29:44.359
He was literally standing
there just a second ago.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.960
Mr Shaw?

29:49.840 --> 29:52.568
Did anybody see where he went?

29:56.120 --> 29:58.919
Well, for some reason,
Mr Shaw seems to have left us.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.880
We must hope he returns.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.680
My husband...

30:30.280 --> 30:33.559
who at this moment
seems to have vanished...

30:33.560 --> 30:36.879
as many of you here will know
from reading about his exploits

30:36.880 --> 30:41.244
during the war, is no
stranger to the unexpected.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.959
And certainly the unexpected
can happen at any time

30:44.960 --> 30:46.199
and without warning -

30:46.200 --> 30:49.960
even here in this hall tonight.

30:52.360 --> 30:57.159
If I were to guess what this
sudden unexplained thing was -

30:57.160 --> 30:59.797
unexplained so far, anyway...

31:00.520 --> 31:04.759
it would be a message
from the Houses of Parliament,

31:04.760 --> 31:10.319
some piece of official business
which is considered so very urgent

31:10.320 --> 31:15.479
and which will certainly turn out
not to be urgent in the morning.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.639
Or even in half an hour!

31:17.640 --> 31:21.459
But of course, that's
how government works.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.510
Or else, of course...

31:28.960 --> 31:31.719
there's another explanation,

31:31.720 --> 31:34.759
and he suddenly found
facing you more frightening

31:34.760 --> 31:38.670
than anything he had
to face during the war!

31:39.480 --> 31:41.839
And standing here now,
I understand why!

31:41.840 --> 31:44.279
But of course we know
that can't be true, don't we?

31:44.280 --> 31:46.799
Because we've all seen him

31:46.800 --> 31:51.679
give stirring, wonderful
speeches in this hall before.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.590
Not wonderful, darling,
but long, certainly!

32:02.280 --> 32:05.279
Forgive me, everyone,
the unexpected did indeed happen,

32:05.280 --> 32:07.079
and it was marked, "Urgent."

32:07.080 --> 32:09.519
And of course, as my
wife correctly guessed,

32:09.520 --> 32:11.639
it turned out not
to be urgent at all.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.359
More than that, I can't tell you,

32:14.360 --> 32:16.039
not today,

32:16.040 --> 32:18.799
but please accept my
deepest, humblest apologies.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.679
But maybe, because of
the interruption,

32:21.680 --> 32:25.359
it gives me an excuse to get
straight to the point tonight.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.119
So no jokes this evening about

32:27.120 --> 32:30.879
my very poor judging
of the flower festival.

32:30.880 --> 32:35.608
Instead, I want to talk
about our place in the world.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.799
Not yours or mine,

32:38.800 --> 32:41.255
but this country of ours...

32:41.840 --> 32:45.599
and its relationship to our
greatest ally, the United States.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.679
Is it a well-balanced marriage,
that is mutually beneficial?

32:49.680 --> 32:51.839
Or is it a stormy love affair

32:51.840 --> 32:56.931
about to rupture after all
we've been through in the war?

33:04.480 --> 33:06.480
I'm so sorry, darling.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.910
I thought you'd gone.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.710
You did marvellously.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.879
Nobody was worried.

33:18.880 --> 33:22.153
Nobody even mentioned it afterwards.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.679
Stop the car, Dalton.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.239
Stop the car now!

33:27.240 --> 33:30.240
What are you doing? It's raining!

33:31.160 --> 33:33.342
Stay in the car, Dalton.

33:36.120 --> 33:39.679
My darling, forgive me.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.239
Please!

33:41.240 --> 33:45.150
What can I do to make
it up to you, darling?

33:50.800 --> 33:52.440
Let's go away.

33:53.680 --> 33:57.119
Nobody would miss me for a
few days, they really won't.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.959
Let's go to Capri.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.870
Let's do it tomorrow.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.119
You love it there.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.839
You know you do.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.920
Let me take you there.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.480
Tomorrow.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.728
To the demonstration tomorrow.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.920
To success.

34:37.080 --> 34:38.958
And to the staff-locator.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.478
To the bleeper!

34:40.480 --> 34:42.438
That's what I like to call it.

34:42.440 --> 34:43.839
No.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.360
To the pager!

34:59.040 --> 35:00.799
So, are we all ready, then?

35:00.800 --> 35:02.559
Good!

35:02.560 --> 35:04.479
Step forward, please, the gentleman

35:04.480 --> 35:09.480
who is to be our first
guinea pig in this demonstration.

35:10.280 --> 35:14.644
Dr Small. An interesting name for
such a big day!

35:15.040 --> 35:19.404
So, I put the staff-locator
in Dr Small's pocket.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.119
Now then, off you
go and hide yourself

35:22.120 --> 35:25.039
anywhere in the hospital you can
think of as quick as you can.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.239
It can be the broom
cupboards, the roof -

35:27.240 --> 35:29.959
wherever you choose,
we will find you.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.199
Someone count to 40 for me.

35:32.200 --> 35:35.959
In 40 seconds,
we will summon Dr Small.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.079
So...

35:38.080 --> 35:40.479
I'm counting under my breath, too.

35:40.480 --> 35:44.799
Dr Small is hiding himself. Let us
hope that he is hiding himself well.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.599
A room with the thickest walls -

35:46.600 --> 35:49.873
his staff-locator will still go off.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.159
I believe that's
40 seconds, Mr Samuel.

35:53.160 --> 35:54.679
Yes.

35:54.680 --> 35:57.039
So, now, here goes.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.677
I summon Dr Small.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.113
And he will return
to us immediately.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.239
Notice -
no hysterical bells ringing,

36:11.240 --> 36:13.199
no Tannoys shouting,

36:13.200 --> 36:16.399
"Emergency! Emergency in Ward 7!"

36:16.400 --> 36:19.239
All the patients getting disturbed.

36:19.240 --> 36:21.080
Total silence.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.742
Dr Small is running towards us.

36:29.840 --> 36:30.999
No, no! False alarm!

36:31.000 --> 36:33.559
The next one will be Dr Small.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.039
Sorry!

36:35.040 --> 36:38.768
I told him to hide
himself well, remember.

36:39.440 --> 36:43.560
I'm still counting.
I'm about to get to 85!

37:06.760 --> 37:08.479
Here he comes!

37:08.480 --> 37:10.239
Dr Small is here.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.439
Well done, Dr Small!

37:12.440 --> 37:13.799
I was in the chapel.

37:13.800 --> 37:17.164
And it went off, it
really did go off!

37:17.200 --> 37:19.473
Now, where's the patient?

37:33.360 --> 37:35.839
Do you think anyone
has... borrowed one?

37:35.840 --> 37:38.799
Stolen one, you mean? No.

37:38.800 --> 37:43.255
I've counted - they're all
here, no-one's got one.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.079
Well, if they don't
want it after that,

37:45.080 --> 37:47.119
they're never, ever
going to want it.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.359
We've shown it works all
over the bloody hospital!

37:49.360 --> 37:53.319
Yes. I look forward to the
first orders tomorrow morning.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.799
What's the matter, Courtney?

37:54.800 --> 37:57.039
As Doreen says,
they can't deny the evidence.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.359
Maybe. I just hope the consultants
aren't going to be difficult.

38:00.360 --> 38:04.399
Won't think they're being summoned
like bellboys or servants

38:04.400 --> 38:06.679
by this thing bleeping
in their pocket.

38:06.680 --> 38:12.771
They won't think that. They really
can't. They can't be that stupid.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.662
I'm just coming, Doreen.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.390
Who the hell are you?

39:27.520 --> 39:29.719
Well, whoever you are,

39:29.720 --> 39:34.902
you better report that it was
a bloody good demonstration.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.400
Straight!

39:40.160 --> 39:42.080
Straight as you can.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.799
I wanted to avoid, if
at all possible,

39:45.800 --> 39:49.159
the appalling books-on-the-head
method.

39:49.160 --> 39:52.639
So if you don't want to be balancing
dictionaries on your heads,

39:52.640 --> 39:55.040
then straight.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.924
Miss Petrukhin?

39:59.200 --> 40:01.279
Can't you bring yourself
to leave the building?

40:01.280 --> 40:02.719
Or are you waiting to see me?

40:02.720 --> 40:04.799
No, I was just thinking.
I'm sorry.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.959
I wasn't waiting to
see you, Mr Halliday.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.279
- Are you sure?
- I am sure.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.119
I don't want to risk talking to
anybody, not in the mood I'm in.

40:12.120 --> 40:15.199
I might say something unforgivable.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.719
Like what?

40:16.720 --> 40:19.175
Say something unforgivable.

40:19.760 --> 40:23.039
Like, it's idiotic for a
grown woman to be in a class

40:23.040 --> 40:27.439
where she's being taught how to walk
and how to sit, for goodness' sake!

40:27.440 --> 40:30.919
And then there's the really,
really vital thing -

40:30.920 --> 40:32.999
how to do a curtsey
that's not too low.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.679
And I have of course to
practise my vowels

40:34.680 --> 40:36.439
when I get home every evening,

40:36.440 --> 40:38.399
just so I can go
to the bloody Palace

40:38.400 --> 40:41.199
and say "thank you,
Your Majesty" to the Queen!

40:41.200 --> 40:43.199
You're sure you have to do it?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.039
Yes. For my parents.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.959
It's my birthright.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.159
You could say I've
given you a bad report.

40:49.160 --> 40:52.359
I can't. My father thinks
I'm in Miss Laidlaw's class.

40:52.360 --> 40:55.199
Well, I can promise you, if I
get you a few minutes with her,

40:55.200 --> 40:57.439
she will definitely
give you a bad report.

40:57.440 --> 40:59.804
Maybe that is worth a try!

41:00.400 --> 41:03.399
I've got a bad report and I'm
going to make a spectacle of myself.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.399
I just have to tell
him that, don't I?

41:05.400 --> 41:07.400
I can do it right now.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.319
Thank you!

41:20.360 --> 41:23.439
I'm looking for my father.
Thank you so much.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.079
I ought to explain, I've
just been to etiquette class,

41:26.080 --> 41:27.639
that's why I'm dressed like this.

41:27.640 --> 41:30.239
I'm so sorry,
of course, I forgot.

41:30.240 --> 41:33.679
I was saying, I've just
been to etiquette class,

41:33.680 --> 41:35.279
that's why I'm looking like this!

41:35.280 --> 41:37.919
I'm going to this occasion
soon at the Palace,

41:37.920 --> 41:41.375
Buckingham Palace,
and I'm dreading it.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.839
My dear, what a surprise!

41:47.840 --> 41:50.568
It is a surprise, I know, Dad.

41:51.280 --> 41:52.839
You catch me staring at the phone -

41:52.840 --> 41:57.659
a thoroughly bad idea,
because it never makes it ring.

42:00.880 --> 42:06.699
Esther is saying how interesting
it would be to go to the Palace.

42:07.080 --> 42:10.679
It's delightful to see you, of
course, my dear,

42:10.680 --> 42:12.590
but why are you here?

42:14.240 --> 42:16.150
I just came to say...

42:18.960 --> 42:21.051
I just wanted to say...

42:24.400 --> 42:26.359
How did the big demonstration go?

42:26.360 --> 42:31.159
You came straight from class
dressed like that to ask me?

42:31.160 --> 42:33.399
Thank you, my dear.
It went marvellously.

42:33.400 --> 42:36.679
The first orders
are about to come through.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.559
And I have some splendid
news in the meantime.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.919
Mrs Shaw - you remember,

42:40.920 --> 42:43.959
the lady we met at the races -
has invited us all to lunch.

42:43.960 --> 42:48.870
We'll be going at half-term
so that Sasha can be there.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.959
Why are you so nervous?
You've met them before.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.279
Yes, but this is different.
This is a big house party.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.599
No, no, no, she said it
was just going to be us.

42:59.600 --> 43:02.419
There's nothing to worry about.

43:06.640 --> 43:09.159
Hello. You're wonderfully punctual.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.759
Look, all the Petrukhins are here!

43:11.760 --> 43:13.519
Yes, so I see.

43:13.520 --> 43:17.239
You'll be pleased to know I
can hear everything at the moment.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.680
Excellent.

43:22.960 --> 43:27.039
And I brought this
bottle of wine from our cellar.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.319
Well, it's more of a
cupboard, really, than a cellar.

43:29.320 --> 43:32.079
Thank you. You
really shouldn't have.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.679
Well, it's quite a rare vintage.

43:33.680 --> 43:36.159
I'm not sure you'd find it in any
wine merchant's -

43:36.160 --> 43:37.639
not around here, certainly.

43:37.640 --> 43:39.399
Arthur will really appreciate this.

43:39.400 --> 43:42.559
We're expecting Arthur any moment.

43:42.560 --> 43:45.479
Lord Wallington. He's the only
other guest, he's a close friend.

43:45.480 --> 43:48.119
Lord Wallington? Really? Goodness.

43:48.120 --> 43:49.799
Why do you say "goodness" like that?

43:49.800 --> 43:51.999
Well, he's quite a famous name!

43:52.000 --> 43:55.039
He's an important man.
Counsellor to kings and emperors.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.639
American presidents, too.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.479
Of course.

43:58.480 --> 44:01.279
Don't worry -
he's a charming fellow, really.

44:01.280 --> 44:03.720
Lucky I brought my bottle!

44:12.120 --> 44:14.239
Hello!

44:14.240 --> 44:18.059
My favourite house
and my favourite people.

44:21.240 --> 44:24.319
I brought an enormous cheese.

44:24.320 --> 44:27.139
I have no idea why, but I have.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.639
Mr Petrukhin brought
this bottle, Arthur.

44:31.640 --> 44:34.368
It's quite an unusual vintage.

44:39.320 --> 44:42.079
You did Mary's
hearing aid, I gather.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.799
Now she's back with us again.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.239
For the time being, I am.

44:46.240 --> 44:48.039
Did you know that Mr Petrukhin

44:48.040 --> 44:50.919
does Winston Churchill's
hearing aid as well?

44:50.920 --> 44:54.119
You do Winston's, do you?

44:54.120 --> 44:56.679
How is he? Holding up, is he?

44:56.680 --> 44:58.959
I think his health
is good at the moment,

44:58.960 --> 45:01.159
but I'll be seeing
him again very soon.

45:01.160 --> 45:04.599
And Mr Petrukhin made something
else, too, a very clever thing.

45:04.600 --> 45:06.199
A staff-locator.

45:06.200 --> 45:11.279
It's a long, thin tube
that you carry in your pocket,

45:11.280 --> 45:14.679
and it gives off a bleep - it
summons you when somebody wants you.

45:14.680 --> 45:17.279
I have one right here,
as it happens.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.239
You've brought one
with you, have you?

45:19.240 --> 45:21.800
Never caught without one.

45:27.400 --> 45:29.519
Really, it's for
the staff, isn't it?

45:29.520 --> 45:30.879
The servants?

45:30.880 --> 45:32.999
So they can be summoned
by a bleep now.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.359
A ping, instead of all those bells.

45:35.360 --> 45:37.039
No, it's not just for them.

45:37.040 --> 45:39.279
I can't demonstrate it
here, unfortunately,

45:39.280 --> 45:41.919
it needs a circuit,
but it can be worn by anybody.

45:41.920 --> 45:44.399
It's not just for the staff?

45:44.400 --> 45:45.799
No.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.359
Maybe I should change its name.

45:47.360 --> 45:48.639
But it's for everybody.

45:48.640 --> 45:50.999
People could wear them
in the House of Lords, for example,

45:51.000 --> 45:53.319
and then they could
find you wherever you are

45:53.320 --> 45:55.319
- in that enormous building.
- Really?

45:55.320 --> 45:57.239
All the lords and
bishops carrying one.

45:57.240 --> 45:59.799
That would be a sight.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.719
Suddenly they're being bleeped,

46:01.720 --> 46:04.902
all pinging away under their robes!

46:05.040 --> 46:07.119
Yes.

46:07.120 --> 46:09.393
A little hard to imagine.

46:13.840 --> 46:18.559
What do you think of this rocket
that's gone up, this satellite?

46:18.560 --> 46:22.359
I think it's the most exciting thing
that has happened in a long time.

46:22.360 --> 46:24.359
You do? Why?

46:24.360 --> 46:26.439
Well, being able to
explore outer space

46:26.440 --> 46:28.279
is extremely important, of course.

46:28.280 --> 46:30.199
We have no idea what we will find.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.959
But what is really exciting -

46:31.960 --> 46:34.439
because this could
happen soon, in fact -

46:34.440 --> 46:38.319
is we will be able to
send live pictures

46:38.320 --> 46:39.799
across the ocean,

46:39.800 --> 46:42.639
be able to bounce
them round the world.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.999
It really is the most
extraordinary time at the moment.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.439
We're sending things up in the sky,

46:46.440 --> 46:48.839
and some of them are coming
down where they shouldn't.

46:48.840 --> 46:51.719
The Americans lose a hydrogen bomb
in the sea and can't find it...

46:51.720 --> 46:53.879
They still haven't found it?

46:53.880 --> 46:55.959
But don't they have to?
It's a nuclear bomb!

46:55.960 --> 46:57.479
They haven't a clue how to find it!

46:57.480 --> 47:00.159
And these satellites could
come crashing down any moment.

47:00.160 --> 47:03.039
Sasha doesn't have to wait for us.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.479
Would you like to get down
and go and explore the garden?

47:05.480 --> 47:07.639
- Would you like that?
- Yes, please.

47:07.640 --> 47:08.959
Yes, he likes to explore.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.599
Exploring is good.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.879
Don't go outside the
walls onto the road.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.319
We don't want to lose him again.

47:14.320 --> 47:17.866
He can't come to any
harm in the garden.

47:37.920 --> 47:44.011
Don't worry. Nothing is going to
come crashing out of the sky today.

47:46.080 --> 47:48.559
Do you speak Russian, Mr Petrukhin?

47:48.560 --> 47:50.039
- Yes.
- Of course!

47:50.040 --> 47:52.039
I was born there.
Came here when I was eight.

47:52.040 --> 47:53.559
But I feel very British.

47:53.560 --> 47:56.719
I'm very fascinated by Russia,
Mr Petrukhin, by its history.

47:56.720 --> 47:59.239
The extraordinary suffering.
The Soviet Revolution.

47:59.240 --> 48:01.999
How brave they were in the war.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.879
And now, of course...

48:04.880 --> 48:06.971
they're our enemies.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.159
Don't worry about Sasha.

48:11.160 --> 48:12.879
I wasn't.

48:19.360 --> 48:22.999
There was a king
who ruled the forest.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.319
He buried lots of things.

48:25.320 --> 48:28.680
He chose me out of everyone.

48:58.240 --> 49:01.479
There are snakes in this orchard.

49:01.480 --> 49:05.039
Big, big snakes.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.280
I warn you. Oof!

49:08.960 --> 49:11.560
You see? See there!

49:16.000 --> 49:18.599
There is no point!

49:18.600 --> 49:21.639
There is no point at all

49:21.640 --> 49:25.559
in me having all this,

49:25.560 --> 49:28.079
if when I buy supplies

49:28.080 --> 49:30.359
they find them,

49:30.360 --> 49:32.719
they find where I keep them!

49:32.720 --> 49:35.879
Ssh! Get down! Get down!

49:35.880 --> 49:37.680
Or they'll see you.

49:48.440 --> 49:52.239
But there's still one place
that they don't know about.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.439
And nobody...

49:54.440 --> 49:56.439
nobody...

49:56.440 --> 49:58.531
nobody will find it.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.000
Thank you, Sasha.

50:22.240 --> 50:25.359
There!

50:25.360 --> 50:28.079
Just around the corner,
there's a little summer house,

50:28.080 --> 50:30.444
and that's where we'll be.

50:32.600 --> 50:36.079
Would you be so kind as to
pick up the notes, the money,

50:36.080 --> 50:38.919
and bring it to the summer house?

50:38.920 --> 50:41.648
That would be so sweet of you.

50:54.120 --> 50:57.279
Thank you, Sasha,
that's so kind of you.

50:57.280 --> 51:00.099
Just put it down there, please.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.746
And as a proper thank you...

51:06.120 --> 51:08.519
I want you to have this.

51:08.520 --> 51:11.200
Please take it... for me.

51:13.240 --> 51:17.399
It'll be our secret, just you and
me, what happened here today.

51:17.400 --> 51:21.359
Don't tell your father or
your mother about anything.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.160
You promise?

51:28.720 --> 51:30.560
It'll be our secret.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.479
Be still!

51:58.480 --> 52:00.999
The other dress fitted.
Why can't I wear that one?

52:01.000 --> 52:03.919
Because your father
bought you this one.

52:03.920 --> 52:05.879
And you look beautiful.

52:05.880 --> 52:08.079
I'm so pleased you're
doing this, Hannah.

52:08.080 --> 52:09.879
It'll be worth it, I promise.

52:09.880 --> 52:13.119
- It could change your life.
- Why aren't you coming, Mum?

52:13.120 --> 52:14.919
Most of the girls have chaperones.

52:14.920 --> 52:17.599
As you know, dear,
I don't like crowds.

52:17.600 --> 52:20.719
I find it really difficult
to be amongst lots of people.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.279
Don't you want to see it?

52:22.280 --> 52:23.959
It means so much to you.

52:23.960 --> 52:27.399
It only means so much to me because
it's such an opportunity for you.

52:27.400 --> 52:30.219
- Is it a success?
- Absolutely.

52:49.800 --> 52:51.710
It's very hot, Peter.

52:52.640 --> 52:54.719
It's getting close to
the time it starts.

52:54.720 --> 52:56.719
I think we should be
moving in a moment.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.359
I'm just going to get some air.

52:58.360 --> 53:00.919
Don't go far. They won't
let in any latecomers.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.239
Yes, I know.

53:02.240 --> 53:04.200
I'll be right here.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.199
Sir Winston is ready.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.839
He is expecting you.

53:16.840 --> 53:20.568
He seems quite pleased
to know it was you.

53:21.480 --> 53:23.559
Come in, come in.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.279
Let's get it over with.

53:25.280 --> 53:28.599
Hello, sir.
It's delightful to see you again.

53:28.600 --> 53:32.279
What's that book you have
there? Is it one of mine?

53:32.280 --> 53:35.479
It is indeed. I was going to
ask you to sign it, in fact.

53:35.480 --> 53:37.760
Of course. Bring it over.

53:40.360 --> 53:44.724
Er, if you could make it
out to Hannah Petrukhin.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.119
That's my daughter -

53:47.120 --> 53:49.999
who is in fact, at this very
moment, at Buckingham Palace

53:50.000 --> 53:52.119
being presented to the Queen.

53:52.120 --> 53:53.600
Is she now?

54:48.960 --> 54:50.880
What is she doing?

55:03.520 --> 55:06.799
Peter! Something
terrible has happened.

55:06.800 --> 55:08.599
My heel snapped off!

55:08.600 --> 55:10.319
I can't go like this.

55:10.320 --> 55:13.399
I can't go like this, Peter!
What are we going to do?

55:13.400 --> 55:15.439
I could nail it back, probably.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.319
If you don't run on it,
it might work.

55:17.320 --> 55:20.079
I can't miss this. My
parents will never forgive me.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.759
I could ask them
if they've got a toolkit.

55:21.760 --> 55:23.999
I'll run and see what I can do.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.719
I'd better keep the shoe!

55:25.720 --> 55:28.599
Everybody get out and walk now.
Gates close in ten minutes.

55:28.600 --> 55:31.279
Run, Peter, run!

55:31.280 --> 55:33.735
Gates close in ten minutes.

55:36.200 --> 55:40.746
- Mate, have you got a toolkit?
- I haven't, sorry.

55:42.240 --> 55:44.039
Mate, you got a toolkit?

55:44.040 --> 55:45.677
Try the other one.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.959
Just stay here - I'm going to try
down there, OK? Just stay here.

55:57.960 --> 55:59.760
Peter!

56:06.680 --> 56:08.719
Walk now, miss.

56:08.720 --> 56:11.039
Gates close at four o'clock.

56:11.040 --> 56:15.440
- Miss?
- I heard. I'll walk.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.999
Miss, what are you doing?
You're running out of time.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.273
And the gates close at four o'clock!

56:42.680 --> 56:46.680
Come on, you bastard! Come on!

56:50.400 --> 56:51.640
All I need.

56:54.480 --> 56:56.800
Come on!

57:16.840 --> 57:18.319
I'm going to make it!

57:18.320 --> 57:19.560
You'll see!

57:22.960 --> 57:26.519
Don't shut the gate.
Don't shut the gate!

57:26.520 --> 57:28.280
Please!

57:34.640 --> 57:36.640
I'm going to make it!

57:39.600 --> 57:42.519
- Everything in order?
- Yes, absolutely.

57:42.520 --> 57:44.319
- All done.
- Good.

57:44.320 --> 57:47.279
It seems to work much better since
he's been using your device again -

57:47.280 --> 57:49.399
he appears to hear a lot more.

57:49.400 --> 57:52.119
Somebody said they stopped
you doing it when he was PM

57:52.120 --> 57:54.879
because they were worried
you were bugging his hearing aid!

57:54.880 --> 57:56.399
Bugging the actual device!

57:56.400 --> 57:57.799
Who said that?

57:57.800 --> 58:00.199
Because you're Russian,
and everything.

58:00.200 --> 58:03.319
Must be involved in
bugging and espionage.

58:03.320 --> 58:05.959
Just a silly joke.
Forget I mentioned it.

58:05.960 --> 58:09.319
No, it's not just a silly joke.
They stopped us from doing it.

58:09.320 --> 58:11.719
I'm absolutely appalled that
anyone would suggest that.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.279
Well, it's all over now.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.199
I am a proud British citizen

58:15.200 --> 58:17.479
and so is Courtney here.

58:17.480 --> 58:18.999
I'm really quite shaken.

58:19.000 --> 58:23.091
What an extraordinary
thing for them to think.

58:24.040 --> 58:25.859
It's that car again.

58:28.160 --> 58:30.159
Them again?

58:30.160 --> 58:33.888
This time, stop in
the middle of the road.

59:02.360 --> 59:06.724
I don't think these are
our competitors, somehow.

59:18.440 --> 59:20.986
Who are these men, Courtney?

59:21.305 --> 59:27.397
