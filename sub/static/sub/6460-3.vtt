00:04.351 --> 00:06.385
People, I have huge news!

00:06.386 --> 00:09.053
Who's carrying the rest of it in?

00:11.992 --> 00:14.960
I found a way to improve diner business,

00:14.961 --> 00:19.665
and the crazy part is I
don't have to fire you two.

00:19.666 --> 00:21.934
Are you gonna clean that dead body smell

00:21.935 --> 00:24.536
out of the ladies' room?

00:24.537 --> 00:28.607
No, that's what plug-in Glade is for.

00:28.608 --> 00:31.276
Okay, remember how that
ice bucket challenge

00:31.277 --> 00:32.677
caught on with celebrities?

00:32.679 --> 00:35.447
Han, people did those challenges for ALS,

00:35.448 --> 00:37.883
not to get publicity for
a diner that Yelp calls,

00:37.884 --> 00:40.019
"A bit of a dice roll."

00:40.020 --> 00:43.022
Well, I've invented the
condiment challenge.

00:43.023 --> 00:44.890
Why, 'cause condoms are a challenge

00:44.891 --> 00:47.191
to you and other virgins?

00:50.330 --> 00:52.563
Earl, you're on fire!

00:53.733 --> 00:56.068
I'm gonna down ketchup and mustard

00:56.069 --> 00:58.303
and then nominate Mr. George Clooney.

00:58.304 --> 01:00.739
If you really want this
thing to go viral,

01:00.740 --> 01:05.275
I happen to know that Clooney
likes him some spicy sriracha.

01:06.546 --> 01:09.614
All I know is that anal is hot.

01:12.452 --> 01:16.388
His wife's name is Amal, not anal.

01:16.389 --> 01:19.258
I still stand by my statement.

01:19.259 --> 01:20.959
Action!

01:20.960 --> 01:24.061
Otherwise known as,
"Let's get this over with."

01:27.901 --> 01:30.535
[garbled] Mr. George...

01:36.309 --> 01:38.844
Uh-oh! I... hot!

01:38.845 --> 01:41.112
Too hot!

01:44.584 --> 01:47.519
I actually think that could go viral.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.688
Damn! I hit the wrong thing.

01:49.689 --> 01:53.058
Han! Han, do over!

01:53.059 --> 01:57.896
My insides are on fire! [screams]

02:16.495 --> 02:19.029
that was drawn on the cupcake board.

02:19.030 --> 02:22.565
And I love Thursdays 'cause
I get to redraw them.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.170
I need some more paper towels.

02:26.171 --> 02:29.173
Oh, I think they're downstairs.

02:29.174 --> 02:31.275
[chuckles]

02:31.276 --> 02:33.644
Max, you do fake stairs so well.

02:33.645 --> 02:35.079
I know.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.249
It's the second best thing I fake.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.084
Hey, isn't that Andy?

02:40.085 --> 02:41.417
My Andy?

02:42.154 --> 02:45.055
Oh, God, it is Candy Andy.

02:45.056 --> 02:46.257
[bicycle bell rings]

02:46.258 --> 02:48.458
He's coming over here.

02:51.229 --> 02:52.997
Hey, Max. Wow.

02:52.998 --> 02:56.834
Your chalkboard has really nice legs.

02:56.835 --> 02:58.569
[chuckles] Hi.

02:58.570 --> 03:01.105
- Hey.
- I know, so silly.

03:01.106 --> 03:04.108
It's just I'm not very
good at seeing my exes.

03:04.109 --> 03:06.309
Yeah, or hiding.

03:08.046 --> 03:09.280
How's the candy business?

03:09.281 --> 03:13.317
Sour? Nutty? Full of Nerds?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.352
It's great. Candy's not going anywhere,

03:15.353 --> 03:17.354
like my grandma's knee fat.

03:17.355 --> 03:18.889
So you guys still over at the diner?

03:18.890 --> 03:21.826
[scoffs] We aren't <i> still</i> at the diner.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.961
This is our cupcake window.

03:23.962 --> 03:25.663
Uh, hello?

03:25.664 --> 03:30.067
Your shift at the diner
started five minutes ago!

03:30.068 --> 03:32.002
Okay, we're still at the diner too.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.604
We're here, we're there, we're all over.

03:33.605 --> 03:34.939
(both) Like herpes?

03:34.940 --> 03:36.373
- Nice.
- Yeah.

03:36.374 --> 03:37.708
So what brings you over here

03:37.709 --> 03:40.010
besides obviously stalking
your ex-girlfriend?

03:40.011 --> 03:42.012
Actually, I'm looking for a flower shop.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.682
Oh, flowers for a girl
you never got over?

03:44.683 --> 03:47.184
Uh, no, for my fiancée.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.319
Did he just say Beyoncé?

03:51.523 --> 03:54.892
Actually, I'm getting married.

03:54.893 --> 03:57.193
Coo.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.965
Caroline, I'm sorry.

04:00.966 --> 04:02.600
I was gonna call you and tell you,

04:02.601 --> 04:04.201
but then I felt like
maybe you wouldn't care.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.437
You know, I mean, it's been a long time.

04:06.438 --> 04:08.072
I hope you're not hurt.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.574
Hurt? I'm hurt.

04:10.575 --> 04:14.545
Hurt that you didn't ask me and
Max to do your wedding cake!

04:14.546 --> 04:16.846
Oh, God. I'll be downstairs.

04:20.151 --> 04:24.388
Well, yeah.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.991
Actually, Romy and I haven't
decided on a cake yet.

04:26.992 --> 04:28.826
You know, she's pretty busy.
She runs her own business.

04:28.827 --> 04:32.029
Ohh! Oh!

04:32.030 --> 04:33.998
"The Business Bride."

04:33.999 --> 04:35.933
Wasn't that Katherine Heigl's last movie?

04:35.934 --> 04:39.036
The one that brought her back to TV?

04:39.037 --> 04:40.804
Max, can you please come back upstairs?

04:40.805 --> 04:43.406
(Max) I'm waiting for the elevator!

04:49.781 --> 04:52.316
Is that Candy Andy?

04:52.317 --> 04:53.450
Well, well.

04:53.451 --> 04:55.219
You two getting back together again?

04:55.220 --> 04:57.421
- Oh, I'm getting married.
- To someone else.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.690
Oh, Lord, this is why I
don't like to be outside.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.062
Well, I gotta run.

05:05.063 --> 05:06.697
Not really. I'll be walking away.

05:06.698 --> 05:08.265
But if you're serious about the cake...

05:08.266 --> 05:09.733
So serious.

05:09.734 --> 05:12.469
Major ser-i-osity!

05:12.470 --> 05:15.072
In fact, it's our wedding gift to you.

05:15.073 --> 05:16.473
- Oh, God.
- Max, stop.

05:16.474 --> 05:18.709
There is no downstairs.

05:18.710 --> 05:23.314
Yeah, it's not possible to
get any lower than this.

05:23.315 --> 05:26.951
Okay, well...

05:26.952 --> 05:28.886
how about I text you
after I talk to Romy?

05:28.887 --> 05:30.154
It was great seeing you, Caroline.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.755
You too, Max.

05:31.756 --> 05:34.191
You guys are gonna watch my
butt as I walk away, right?

05:34.192 --> 05:36.994
You gonna make it clap for daddy?

05:36.995 --> 05:40.596
I cannot make it clap, but
I can make it go, "Whoo!"

05:43.101 --> 05:46.770
Um, couple things.

05:46.771 --> 05:48.472
One, he's still hot.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.708
And two, are you insane?

05:50.709 --> 05:53.677
You want us to do your
ex-boyfriend's wedding cake?

05:53.678 --> 05:56.947
Max, I broke up with him. Remember?

05:56.948 --> 05:59.483
I'm a mature, evolved, sophisticated,

05:59.484 --> 06:02.920
sexy but not in your face about it woman.

06:02.921 --> 06:04.054
I can handle this.

06:04.055 --> 06:05.956
I think it's a bad idea.

06:05.957 --> 06:09.226
And I know bad ideas. I was one.

06:09.227 --> 06:11.528
I...

06:11.529 --> 06:15.366
broke up... with him.

06:15.367 --> 06:18.636
Dramatic... talking...

06:18.637 --> 06:21.170
is... annoying.

06:25.477 --> 06:26.944
How's it going there, hot stuff?

06:26.945 --> 06:29.113
Is your tongue working?

06:29.114 --> 06:31.382
I'm gonna think of another
video to go viral

06:31.383 --> 06:34.018
to set this place on fire, and if not,

06:34.019 --> 06:37.821
I'll eventually have to
set this place on fire.

06:37.822 --> 06:39.923
Either way, I'm not giving up.

06:39.924 --> 06:42.625
You tell your clothes that?
'Cause they didn't get the memo.

06:43.795 --> 06:46.397
Get this. Andy says that he and Romy

06:46.398 --> 06:48.432
would love to meet us to
talk about wedding cakes

06:48.433 --> 06:50.401
at their loft in Manhattan.

06:50.402 --> 06:52.469
[British accent]
Queen Romy has summoned us

06:52.470 --> 06:56.005
to a cake tasting at their loft!

06:58.009 --> 07:01.345
Uh, can I borrow your phone for a sec?

07:01.346 --> 07:02.813
There. I deleted his text.

07:02.814 --> 07:03.881
I deleted his number.

07:03.882 --> 07:07.384
I also deleted my number.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.753
We aren't doing this.
You are not that cool.

07:09.754 --> 07:11.255
Everyone knows that.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.757
You're not. Cool girls don't freak out

07:13.758 --> 07:16.492
when you cop a feel in the freezer.

07:17.862 --> 07:19.196
Oh! Oh!

07:19.197 --> 07:20.998
You know his number by heart.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.766
This has nothing to do with my heart.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.968
It's business. I broke up with him.

07:24.969 --> 07:27.370
It's like you don't know
that I broke up with him.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.441
I broke up with him.
Didn't know if you caught that

07:30.442 --> 07:32.576
'cause my back was to you.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.044
Hey, everybody!

07:40.685 --> 07:42.252
Good news!

07:42.253 --> 07:45.522
My baby was delivered today.

07:45.523 --> 07:47.057
Oh, my God!

07:47.058 --> 07:49.859
Did I black out for nine months again?

07:51.262 --> 07:54.665
The baby didn't come
out of my box, Earl.

07:54.666 --> 07:58.102
It came out of this one.

07:58.103 --> 08:02.239
Wow, you can really get
anything on Amazon.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.174
It's called a "Maybe Baby."

08:04.175 --> 08:06.910
While Oleg and I are
trying to get pregnant,

08:06.911 --> 08:11.682
we're gonna use it to
practice for the real thing.

08:11.683 --> 08:13.716
So you're having a key-section?

08:19.324 --> 08:21.558
Strangely, this is not the weirdest birth

08:21.559 --> 08:25.696
we've seen at the diner.

08:25.697 --> 08:27.631
Do you like him?

08:27.632 --> 08:31.702
Weren't you the baby
in "American Sniper"?

08:31.703 --> 08:34.004
Yeah, it's got a computer
inside to keep track

08:34.005 --> 08:35.606
of our parenting skills.

08:35.607 --> 08:39.208
And if we get a score of over 92,

08:39.210 --> 08:41.410
we get 20% at Papa John's.

08:41.412 --> 08:44.046
Any Papa John's!

08:45.617 --> 08:49.285
Well, you're having a fake baby
for all the right reasons.

08:51.256 --> 08:52.823
The baby's here?

08:52.824 --> 08:56.794
Aww, you're a father. Think fast!

08:56.795 --> 08:58.495
Aww!

08:58.496 --> 09:01.532
Our first father-son catch.

09:01.533 --> 09:05.269
Let's get to know each other... "Bob"?

09:05.270 --> 09:08.505
All they had left were the white babies.

09:08.506 --> 09:12.909
The single actresses over 40
snap up all the minorities.

09:15.713 --> 09:18.148
Hey, Max.

09:18.149 --> 09:22.252
Could you maybe babysit
my Maybe Baby tomorrow?

09:22.253 --> 09:26.523
You know, 'cause I-I
really need some me time.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.192
Fine. 20 bucks an hour.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.860
Extra in case he orders some adult movies

09:29.861 --> 09:32.196
I've been wanting to see.

09:32.197 --> 09:35.499
Okay, Max, wash your fancy sweatpants.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.234
We are confirmed for Andy and Romy's

09:37.235 --> 09:39.336
wedding cake tasting for tomorrow.

09:39.337 --> 09:42.272
[gasps] Andy? You mean that cute guy

09:42.273 --> 09:45.275
that you ruined your relationship with?

09:45.276 --> 09:47.811
Sophie, it wasn't the right relationship.

09:47.812 --> 09:50.380
He didn't support my career.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.481
The cupcake thing?

09:54.819 --> 09:56.652
[bell rings]

10:04.128 --> 10:06.430
Pickup!

10:06.431 --> 10:08.564
Like father like son.

10:17.443 --> 10:19.644
Thank you guys so much for coming.

10:19.645 --> 10:21.179
These cakes look so lovely.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.715
They are.

10:23.716 --> 10:25.583
Really nice place you got here.

10:25.584 --> 10:29.420
I noticed there was a
door on the bathroom.

10:29.421 --> 10:32.724
I don't want to brag, but check
out all the outlets we got.

10:32.725 --> 10:35.226
Lot of power. Two-prong, three-prong.

10:35.227 --> 10:37.061
You got one of those
weird European plugs?

10:37.062 --> 10:39.497
Bring it.

10:39.498 --> 10:40.698
How funny is he?

10:40.699 --> 10:44.402
Oh, the funniest.

10:44.403 --> 10:46.971
Oh, God.

10:46.972 --> 10:49.207
So, Romy, it looks like you travel a lot.

10:49.208 --> 10:50.508
I love all your...

10:50.509 --> 10:52.977
[French accent] <i>Objet d'art.</i>

10:52.978 --> 10:55.613
Oh, God.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.582
I'm a hat designer, so I go to Malaysia

10:57.583 --> 10:59.751
and Sri Lanka a lot for materials.

10:59.752 --> 11:02.887
I'm poor, so I go to
McDonald's and Taco Bell a lot

11:02.888 --> 11:04.788
for my meals.

11:06.091 --> 11:07.759
Oh, show 'em one of your hats, Romes.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.528
The purple one Pippa Middleton
wore in "Star" magazine.

11:10.529 --> 11:13.765
Oh! Pippa Middleton, wow.

11:13.766 --> 11:15.633
She was up for a job
on "The Today Show,"

11:15.634 --> 11:17.134
but she didn't get it.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.208
Andy, they don't want to see my hats.

11:23.209 --> 11:24.976
Oh, Andy wants us to see your hats.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.178
Let's see your hats. [giggles]

11:27.179 --> 11:29.914
Oh, this guy was there when
no one believed in me,

11:29.915 --> 11:31.883
and he supported me in every way,

11:31.884 --> 11:34.586
and now I'm in over a hundred
department stores worldwide.

11:34.587 --> 11:37.255
Worldwide? [forced laugh]

11:37.256 --> 11:39.923
That is wide.

11:42.695 --> 11:45.296
You know the tasting is for them, right?

11:45.297 --> 11:47.398
Come on, let 'em see what you do.

11:47.399 --> 11:49.200
Sorry, I'm a proud fiancé.

11:49.201 --> 11:51.569
It's a little unmanly, but it's m'thing.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.137
Ooh, I'll go get Black Dahlia.

11:53.138 --> 11:55.439
Max will like that one.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.515
[coughs] Oh!

12:04.516 --> 12:05.550
You okay?

12:05.551 --> 12:07.218
Absolutely.

12:07.219 --> 12:09.420
We didn't work out, you
found someone great,

12:09.421 --> 12:12.624
supported her business, and
now you're getting married.

12:12.625 --> 12:16.027
Pretty sure he meant, "Are you choking?"

12:16.028 --> 12:17.996
Yup, that's where I was headed.

12:17.997 --> 12:19.998
Caroline, you broke up with me.

12:19.999 --> 12:21.666
She broke up with you?

12:21.667 --> 12:24.469
I hadn't heard that.

12:24.470 --> 12:27.471
See? All bitter... better.

12:29.308 --> 12:31.276
Max, do you want to try it on?

12:31.277 --> 12:33.211
Ahem, she doesn't need a hat.

12:33.212 --> 12:36.781
Romes said I could have the sweet hat!

12:36.782 --> 12:39.384
Oh, it looks adorable on her.
You should have it.

12:39.385 --> 12:42.587
[chuckles] What is this,
a hat tasting now?

12:42.588 --> 12:44.789
Well, it's not a cupcake tasting anymore

12:44.790 --> 12:46.658
'cause you ate them all.

12:46.659 --> 12:49.560
You guys are hilarious.
I don't need to taste those.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.596
You and Max are a part of Andy's past,

12:51.597 --> 12:53.665
and I would honored if you'd do our cake

12:53.666 --> 12:55.566
and come to the wedding as our guests.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.769
Oh, that is a great idea.
Hey, there will be a lot

12:57.770 --> 12:59.771
of self-destructive man-children there.

12:59.772 --> 13:02.941
Max, feels like your kind of party.

13:02.942 --> 13:04.943
And it's on this awesome yacht.

13:04.944 --> 13:07.879
You know, technically it's not a yacht

13:07.880 --> 13:10.348
unless it's over 40 feet.

13:10.349 --> 13:12.349
Is it? Okay.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.453
Come on. It'll be fun.

13:15.454 --> 13:18.122
Gah! I don't know.

13:18.123 --> 13:19.958
And I'm not really into fun.

13:19.959 --> 13:22.727
You know, I've had fun
and it's not that fun.

13:22.728 --> 13:24.996
Got it. What was I thinking?

13:24.997 --> 13:26.698
Be weird for you, Caroline, right?

13:26.699 --> 13:28.666
Weird?

13:28.667 --> 13:31.169
Weird if we didn't come!

13:31.170 --> 13:33.370
Oh, God.

13:40.215 --> 13:42.083
Look at this, Max.

13:42.084 --> 13:44.785
Cupcakes and candy.

13:44.786 --> 13:46.921
This could have been me and Andy's cake.

13:46.922 --> 13:50.324
Our perfect cake for
our perfect marriage.

13:50.325 --> 13:54.395
No marriage is perfect...
except Ice-T and Coco.

13:54.396 --> 13:56.097
Now, he's not perfect.

13:56.098 --> 13:58.699
You broke up with him for a reason.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.667
Andy's out there now. Come here.

14:00.668 --> 14:02.002
<i>[romantic music playing]</i>

14:02.003 --> 14:05.205
Music at a wedding? How original.

14:05.206 --> 14:06.840
Oh, there he is.

14:06.841 --> 14:10.377
He looks so handsome in a tuxedo.

14:10.378 --> 14:13.380
Calm down. So does Jane Lynch.

14:13.381 --> 14:15.616
He's not perfect. Look, there.

14:15.617 --> 14:18.085
He's going in for a nose pick.

14:18.086 --> 14:20.821
No, just a scratch.

14:20.822 --> 14:25.659
He has such nice hands. Big hands.

14:25.660 --> 14:28.362
And there's gonna be a ring on it soon.

14:28.363 --> 14:31.098
He's looking over here! Oh, oh!

14:31.099 --> 14:33.734
- He can't see me cry!
- Okay, come on.

14:33.735 --> 14:35.035
Think of something bad about him.

14:35.036 --> 14:36.870
Think, think, think, think, think.

14:36.871 --> 14:40.841
Uh... he always took too
long to finish during sex!

14:40.842 --> 14:44.745
Oh, wait. That's a good thing.

14:44.746 --> 14:48.081
It is? All right, come on.

14:48.082 --> 14:49.917
There had to be something terribly wrong

14:49.918 --> 14:51.018
with that relationship.

14:51.019 --> 14:54.087
There was. That I ended it.

14:54.088 --> 14:57.491
I kicked the perfect guy
for me out of my life.

14:57.492 --> 14:59.526
Yup, here come the tears.

14:59.527 --> 15:01.195
And here comes Andy!

15:01.196 --> 15:04.865
Uh, do you have a bathroom? Oh!

15:04.866 --> 15:06.633
[wedding guests applauding]

15:06.634 --> 15:09.169
Hey! Thought I saw you
guys peeking out of here.

15:09.170 --> 15:12.206
So you guys act weird everywhere?

15:12.207 --> 15:13.740
Yup, that's our signature.

15:13.741 --> 15:16.977
Got us bounced out of Six Flags.

15:16.978 --> 15:18.745
Where's Caroline?

15:18.746 --> 15:20.247
The pretty ladies' room.

15:20.248 --> 15:21.682
(both) Hmm.

15:21.683 --> 15:23.283
So it looks like you're getting married

15:23.284 --> 15:25.219
to Not Caroline.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.820
How's she doing?

15:26.821 --> 15:28.522
I'm getting the feeling
this has been hard for her.

15:28.523 --> 15:30.891
Temperature check.

15:30.892 --> 15:32.659
Okay, I don't understand.

15:32.660 --> 15:37.164
Are you asking me to bend over?

15:37.165 --> 15:39.166
What if Caroline thought
she might have made a mistake

15:39.167 --> 15:40.767
by breaking up with you?
Would you consider being

15:40.768 --> 15:42.669
a runaway groom and giving it
another shot with her?

15:42.670 --> 15:44.304
Just a thought.

15:44.305 --> 15:46.340
Well, I guess I'd have
to say it's too late.

15:46.341 --> 15:48.909
I'm getting married to Romy. I love her.

15:48.910 --> 15:50.943
So that's a firm no?

15:54.816 --> 15:57.650
Uh, Max.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.686
All yours now.

16:02.824 --> 16:04.791
How about we pretend like
none of this happened

16:04.792 --> 16:07.060
and you guys come watch
me get married, okay?

16:07.061 --> 16:10.230
Andy, wait.

16:10.231 --> 16:12.499
I'm sorry.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.669
I really am happy for you.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.205
Go live your life. I wish you well.

16:18.206 --> 16:22.109
Thank you. That means a lot to me.

16:22.110 --> 16:24.678
Um...

16:24.679 --> 16:27.648
I really did love you.

16:27.649 --> 16:29.182
I know.

16:29.183 --> 16:30.617
Even though you broke up with me.

16:30.618 --> 16:33.386
Yeah, even though I broke up with you.

16:39.294 --> 16:42.562
I did it. I didn't cry.

16:42.563 --> 16:45.131
Max, what's wrong?

16:49.537 --> 16:52.204
[sobbing] You could have had it all!

16:54.776 --> 16:57.044
Max, I've never seen you cry.

16:57.045 --> 17:02.382
I'm sorry, but maybe he
was the perfect guy!

17:02.383 --> 17:06.086
And he loved you! You heard him!

17:06.087 --> 17:09.556
Max, it's okay. Nobody gets it all.

17:09.557 --> 17:11.191
Max, turn around and look at me.

17:11.192 --> 17:13.593
No, I don't want you to see me cry.

17:13.594 --> 17:17.330
Max, turn around.

17:17.332 --> 17:20.199
This hat doesn't even work!

17:24.472 --> 17:27.107
Oh, hey, I was just
looking for the bathroom.

17:27.108 --> 17:29.343
I wanted to get stoned
before Andy got hitched.

17:29.344 --> 17:31.712
You got some love for
me and my friend here?

17:31.713 --> 17:34.014
- We need it.
- Whoa.

17:34.015 --> 17:35.649
They put candy on Andy's wedding cake?

17:35.650 --> 17:37.584
Brutal, dude.

17:37.585 --> 17:39.453
Why is it brutal, dude?

17:39.454 --> 17:41.855
'Cause of the bald spot
where I ate the gumdrops?

17:41.856 --> 17:44.424
No, I mean with Andy's
business in the toilet.

17:44.425 --> 17:46.893
Andy's business is in the toilet?

17:46.894 --> 17:49.396
Yeah, he had to close
it down, but it's cool.

17:49.397 --> 17:51.832
Romy's, like, loaded now.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.166
I can't believe Andy didn't tell me

17:53.167 --> 17:54.868
his business was in the toilet.

17:54.869 --> 17:56.636
[knocks on door]

17:56.637 --> 17:58.405
Oh, bummer.

17:58.406 --> 18:00.507
Looks like I gotta do
this wedding thing sobes.

18:00.508 --> 18:03.142
As long as it's not me, right?

18:05.346 --> 18:08.115
That stoner, who I can easily see

18:08.116 --> 18:11.585
having very sloppy sex with later,

18:11.586 --> 18:15.455
just saved the day 'cause now
we know Andy lied to you.

18:15.456 --> 18:18.225
And I wouldn't want to be with
someone who can't be honest.

18:18.226 --> 18:20.427
See? He is so not perfect.

18:20.428 --> 18:22.929
You so would not have had it all.

18:22.930 --> 18:25.365
- Caroline.
- Andy?

18:25.366 --> 18:28.035
I'm kind of in a hurry but I
think you should know something.

18:28.036 --> 18:30.570
I lost my business.

18:30.571 --> 18:32.472
I didn't want to tell you
because I was too proud.

18:32.473 --> 18:35.008
I wanted you to think my life
was perfect, and it's not.

18:35.009 --> 18:37.377
I mean, it's great,
but it's not perfect.

18:37.378 --> 18:40.913
Okay, I gotta go get married.
See you out there.

18:45.286 --> 18:47.854
All right, so he's perfect.

18:47.855 --> 18:50.590
I guess I'm not taking this dress back

18:50.591 --> 18:52.759
'cause we're swimming home.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.227
We're not swimming.

18:54.228 --> 18:56.629
We're gonna take the
"I hate my life" boat.

19:02.170 --> 19:04.037
Um, big news.

19:04.038 --> 19:06.940
Andy and Romy are in Mexico
for their honeymoon.

19:06.941 --> 19:08.208
Weather forecast?

19:08.209 --> 19:12.012
Cloudy with a chance of diarrhea.

19:12.013 --> 19:14.581
Um, can I borrow that for a sec?

19:14.582 --> 19:16.116
Oh, you're on her Instagram.

19:16.117 --> 19:17.851
Cute. Good-bye.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.352
You unfollowed her?

19:19.353 --> 19:20.687
Now it's gonna look like I'm jealous

19:20.688 --> 19:22.255
and can't handle their happiness.

19:22.256 --> 19:24.024
Ya can't!

19:24.025 --> 19:26.960
Hey, everybody! Look!

19:26.961 --> 19:29.696
I got our report card back
from the Maybe Baby people!

19:29.697 --> 19:31.731
We passed the test!

19:31.732 --> 19:35.702
We're gonna be solid "C" parents!

19:35.703 --> 19:38.438
Well, that's a better
grade than the diner got.

19:38.439 --> 19:40.607
I'm gonna miss that little guy.

19:40.608 --> 19:42.375
What I'm not gonna miss is fighting it

19:42.376 --> 19:44.510
to get to Sophie's boob.

19:46.214 --> 19:48.248
Okay, people.

19:48.249 --> 19:49.683
Are you leaving?

19:49.684 --> 19:52.652
I hope it was something I said.

19:52.653 --> 19:55.088
Well, I have a video
that is sure to go viral.

19:55.089 --> 19:57.557
I'm gonna stuff myself in this suitcase

19:57.558 --> 19:59.726
for the Williamsburg Diner challenge.

19:59.727 --> 20:01.428
Caroline, you film it this time.

20:01.429 --> 20:03.096
Max, you zip me up.

20:03.097 --> 20:07.134
And I thought I'd be the
first one to die here.

I, Han Lee, nominate Mr. George Clooney

20:10.705 --> 20:12.572
to the Williamsburg Diner challenge

20:12.573 --> 20:14.708
of packing yourself in a suitcase.

20:14.709 --> 20:18.311
I'm also a fan of "The
Men Who Stare At Goats."

Let 'er zip, Max!

20:21.048 --> 20:24.850
Han... consider this my birthday present.

20:26.954 --> 20:30.056
I got my Papa John's gift certificate.

20:30.057 --> 20:33.360
Mama Sophie wants to buy
pizza for everyone!

20:33.361 --> 20:35.961
Well, now is as good a time as any.

(Han) Hello?

20:39.700 --> 20:42.936
Are you filming? Hello?

Don't tell George Clooney!
