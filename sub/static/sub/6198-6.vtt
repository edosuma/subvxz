00:46.240 --> 00:48.030
Who's there?

01:10.100 --> 01:12.610
Wh-Who's there?

02:44.490 --> 02:47.060
-=Ghost-Seeing Detective:
Cheo Yong 2=-

02:47.070 --> 02:49.150
-=Episode 6: "Memories"=-

02:55.550 --> 02:56.960
What the heck?

02:57.210 --> 03:00.010
My hand should have worked
that time.

03:01.730 --> 03:03.300
What? Why?

03:03.340 --> 03:06.280
I don't even care if you don't
want to talk to me!

03:06.310 --> 03:09.630
It's boring to have no one to
play with you, isn't it?

03:11.730 --> 03:15.780
Not a bit of human compassion,
just his damn pride.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.650
I told you not to speak to me but
that doesn't mean ignore me!

03:19.040 --> 03:21.620
You just don't understand women.

03:22.190 --> 03:27.500
If you want to be like this,
ghosts can find new humans too!

03:28.100 --> 03:31.610
This, this has to be made up.
Made up, right?

03:31.750 --> 03:34.630
Some nonsense about being
possessed.

03:34.810 --> 03:37.430
What? Possessed?

03:39.150 --> 03:42.750
It's some story about a high school
student ghost, but it's not real.

03:42.860 --> 03:48.990
If this supposed to be possession,
then sometimes even you act a
bit weird...

03:50.350 --> 03:51.780
Well...

03:52.600 --> 03:54.840
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

03:56.550 --> 03:58.410
Yes, Department Chief.

03:58.980 --> 04:00.280
What?

04:01.380 --> 04:03.380
Is that true?

04:04.150 --> 04:06.010
I understand.

04:06.490 --> 04:07.860
Yes.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.550
Is it... a big case?

04:12.590 --> 04:15.370
Did one of you make a mistake?

04:15.390 --> 04:16.510
Why?

04:16.709 --> 04:18.829
Do they want to disband our team?

04:18.860 --> 04:20.940
The Department Chief wants to
meet with us.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.010
He said he'll treat us to spicy
grilled chicken. [dakgalbi]

04:29.030 --> 04:32.330
Hurry and try some.
It's very tender.

04:32.330 --> 04:35.540
It's nice going out to eat
during work time.

04:35.810 --> 04:38.980
But all of us eating a free meal
is a bit...

04:39.070 --> 04:40.740
<i>Don't feel embarrassed.</i>

04:40.920 --> 04:43.590
The owner of this place owes me
a lot of favors.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.670
Waiter! Two more sets of
dakgalbi here!

04:46.780 --> 04:48.010
<i>Okay.</i>

04:48.700 --> 04:51.270
Okay! Then let's dig in.

04:51.300 --> 04:53.320
This place is in trouble today.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.750
Our Detective Jeong, once she
starts eating, she can really
pack it away.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.390
Hey. Go buy some digestive
medicine.

05:01.420 --> 05:02.990
Digestive medicine?

05:03.360 --> 05:04.430
Yes.

05:06.010 --> 05:08.770
Stop talking so much and just
eat something.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.850
It's really good. Try some.

05:17.670 --> 05:21.240
I'm eating. I'll talk to you later.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.130
We have a case.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.260
It's not that church kind of place,
is it?

05:45.290 --> 05:47.210
Why? You don't want to?

05:47.800 --> 05:49.040
You have no place to sleep.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.940
Do you want to stay a few days,
then go crawling back?

05:54.560 --> 05:57.910
Excuse me. Is there a problem?

05:57.950 --> 05:59.370
Hold on.

05:59.630 --> 06:01.240
It's Tae Gyeong oppa!

06:01.270 --> 06:02.360
<i>What? </i>

06:02.380 --> 06:03.740
Police.

06:04.370 --> 06:07.110
If you want to, then call me.

06:13.310 --> 06:15.300
You're a student.

06:15.810 --> 06:18.090
What's going on here?

06:23.140 --> 06:26.410
Yang Hyeon Mu.
Be sure to find him.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.620
-=2015 Tchaikovsky Competition
Winner - Welcome Han Ji Su!=-

06:51.690 --> 06:53.410
Okay, let's begin.

06:53.460 --> 06:56.480
Our school's best pianist,

06:56.590 --> 07:01.350
winner of the national competition
in middle school, Song Da Jeong!

07:03.680 --> 07:06.870
Hey. Haven't you all seen
that movie?

07:07.010 --> 07:10.650
If the audience is enthusiastic,
they can play better.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.820
Again! Applause!

07:39.270 --> 07:42.090
Okay, next is a rising star.

07:42.090 --> 07:45.110
The amazing musical prodigy,
Yang Hye Mi!

08:11.520 --> 08:13.290
Okay, now it's your turn.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.330
No way.

08:14.430 --> 08:17.330
Would you dare to play here if
you were me?

08:18.050 --> 08:19.740
Isn't that right, Ji Su?

08:20.000 --> 08:24.590
Didn't we practice one before?
The Hye Mi movie music mix.

08:24.860 --> 08:25.950
Okay.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.420
Hey. You all heard it, right?

09:16.420 --> 09:18.410
Ji Su played it wrong.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.220
Sorry.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.650
This hand can't keep up.
That's why I don't practice much.

09:26.760 --> 09:30.810
No, you played very well.
I just rearranged it.

09:31.170 --> 09:34.500
Actually, it was me who played
it wrong.

09:49.740 --> 09:51.960
Hey, what are you all doing here?

09:52.010 --> 09:55.160
Didn't I tell you to go to the
auditorium? Get going!

09:55.220 --> 09:56.900
Hurry up!

09:59.430 --> 10:01.670
It's been a long time, Da Jeong.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.200
You've been well?

10:04.200 --> 10:07.040
<i>Han Ji Su. Song Da Jeong.</i>

10:12.150 --> 10:16.060
Girl, you really seem like
a teacher.

10:19.610 --> 10:22.040
You've turned out pretty cool,
Han Ji Su.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.850
The foreign water must suit you.

10:23.860 --> 10:25.490
Since we graduated,

10:25.490 --> 10:27.440
has it been 7 years?

10:32.830 --> 10:36.570
- I'm depending on you.
<i>- Is he a new transfer student?</i>

10:36.870 --> 10:39.800
Why does she look like she's
about to be executed?

10:39.800 --> 10:42.000
It's really pathetic.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.680
Yes, Team leader.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.780
The student is back in school,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.600
so I'm coming back.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.100
Jealous?

10:52.650 --> 10:57.410
If I had such a caring teacher
like him, I would have studied
more.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.190
When are you going back to
Germany?

11:02.190 --> 11:03.000
Tomorrow.

11:03.010 --> 11:05.590
This time, you don't plan to
come back?

11:05.610 --> 11:09.020
Until I get well established,
I can't come back.

11:09.790 --> 11:12.070
I really can't stand it.

11:12.270 --> 11:14.570
It's not like she's a celebrity.

11:14.670 --> 11:16.140
Really?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.510
<i>You're so pretty.</i>

11:19.150 --> 11:21.390
I have to make a call.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.660
Okay.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.530
Ji Su, this is for you.

11:38.530 --> 11:42.430
The school must have prepared
a gift for you.

11:43.800 --> 11:48.250
After the students finish playing,
it's your turn, so get ready.

12:23.670 --> 12:28.700
I knew he was above average.
He even likes this high-class stuff.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.550
This isn't too bad.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.010
What in the world is she doing?

13:03.310 --> 13:04.990
What's wrong?

13:05.340 --> 13:06.610
Don't you remember?

13:06.610 --> 13:09.940
Every time we practiced, this is
what Hye Mi played.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.730
Every note is exactly the same.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.190
What was that?

13:41.020 --> 13:45.520
This student was probably too
nervous in front of our guests.

13:45.520 --> 13:52.530
Next I'd like to introduce the
2015 Tchaikovsky Competition
winner, pianist Han Ji Su!

14:15.100 --> 14:16.720
Ji Su!

14:17.820 --> 14:19.790
Ji Su, are you all right?

14:22.220 --> 14:25.530
<i>- What happened?
- What's wrong?</i>

14:34.340 --> 14:40.030
What to do? For a pianist,
their hands are their lifeblood.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.750
Hey! Hey!

14:51.020 --> 14:53.140
Where did she go?

15:02.960 --> 15:05.900
<i>How would I know who did it?</i>

15:05.900 --> 15:09.310
There must be someone besides
us who knows Ji Su.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.770
Or maybe Hye Mi really did it.

15:11.770 --> 15:13.470
What are you talking about?

15:13.560 --> 15:16.540
Today is September 18th,
Hye Mi's death anniversary.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.060
Hye Mi?

15:18.480 --> 15:20.580
Are they talking about that girl
just now?

15:20.580 --> 15:22.780
<i>I actually thought you did it.</i>

15:22.780 --> 15:26.210
Thinking about it, Ji Su also
stole your position.

15:26.220 --> 15:28.020
What are you talking about?

15:28.030 --> 15:29.760
To be honest,

15:29.760 --> 15:32.000
you're much better than she is.

15:32.330 --> 15:36.550
But after Hye Mi died, she entered
competitions in her memory and
got this reputation.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.470
Isn't that right?

15:37.470 --> 15:38.930
Stop talking about it.

15:38.930 --> 15:40.570
Stop talking?

15:41.140 --> 15:45.030
When have we ever really
talked about this before?

15:47.010 --> 15:52.150
Don't tell me you still think I
killed Hye Mi?

15:52.150 --> 15:53.940
Hey, Yu Ga Yeong!

15:55.450 --> 15:57.650
We really shouldn't meet again.

15:57.650 --> 16:00.960
Since we only suspect each other,
let's keep avoiding each other!

16:00.960 --> 16:04.710
Don't you know it's all of you
suspecting and avoiding, not me?

16:12.530 --> 16:14.990
Things seem really tense.

16:15.830 --> 16:18.540
What in the world happened here?

16:26.770 --> 16:27.990
Are you warmed up?

16:28.020 --> 16:28.850
Yes.

16:28.850 --> 16:29.580
Here.

16:29.580 --> 16:30.690
It's fine.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.490
You're not wearing one, so we
should be fair.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.260
The sound of his girlfriend's
heartbeat!

17:09.589 --> 17:11.160
Stop! Stop!

17:11.430 --> 17:13.829
Be careful not to hurt his
handsome face!

17:16.930 --> 17:18.359
Are you all right?

17:20.599 --> 17:23.000
I should have listened to you.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.140
It's Drunken Master from now on.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.220
So what?

17:38.220 --> 17:39.690
What do you mean, so what?

17:39.690 --> 17:43.730
That spirit is floating around the
school for some reason!

17:43.730 --> 17:45.190
Investigate it with me.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.400
That kid, why hasn't he come
out yet?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.560
It's hot in here.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.590
I must be bothering you.

17:52.170 --> 17:53.250
Fine.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.670
I don't need your permission to
do my own investigation!

17:58.410 --> 17:59.580
"You"?
[her informal reference to him]

17:59.720 --> 18:01.010
You brat...

18:04.650 --> 18:07.580
She's going to cause trouble
again.

18:09.990 --> 18:12.470
She's been studying this all day.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.590
What case is it this time?

18:15.590 --> 18:17.000
-=Food eaten after possession=-

18:17.000 --> 18:21.300
Following this logic, it must be
the same spirit.

18:22.570 --> 18:23.685
Spirit?

18:25.080 --> 18:27.840
Probably young...

18:28.560 --> 18:31.570
<i>But really likes to eat.</i>

18:31.810 --> 18:34.380
What? She means me!

18:34.380 --> 18:35.840
<i>Larger size?</i>

18:35.840 --> 18:37.410
<i>Old-fashioned?</i>

18:38.410 --> 18:41.710
What crappy investigation is this?

18:44.290 --> 18:45.690
-="Detective Conan"=-

18:45.690 --> 18:48.190
It's unpredictable.

18:49.790 --> 18:55.010
One thing for sure, it knows
the team members here well,

18:55.300 --> 18:59.330
and is very familiar with police
procedures.

18:59.330 --> 19:00.990
<i>Could it be...</i>

19:01.540 --> 19:07.040
It looks like I don't have much
time to borrow her body today.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.590
Well, too bad.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.600
I'm going in.

19:23.190 --> 19:24.760
Hello!

19:25.760 --> 19:28.160
You took a long shower.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.800
You smell pretty good.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.070
Let's go back to that school.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.770
Why do you want to go back?

19:36.770 --> 19:45.010
Someone reported that what
happened yesterday was related
to a death 7 years ago.

19:45.210 --> 19:48.020
Report? What report?

19:48.150 --> 19:50.820
Jong Hyeon seonbae, good timing!

19:51.450 --> 19:53.690
Again. Again.

19:55.490 --> 19:56.590
Come.

19:56.590 --> 19:59.890
Without Detective Yun we can
still do well, be enthusiastic!

19:59.890 --> 20:05.380
Truthfully, that detective
crime-solving instinct...

20:05.770 --> 20:07.240
you have it much stronger.

20:07.240 --> 20:07.970
Right?

20:07.970 --> 20:09.800
Of course, of course.

20:09.800 --> 20:13.620
Here. Drink some coffee.

20:13.840 --> 20:14.580
Fighting.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.780
As usual, you're very perceptive.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.590
Also,

20:17.710 --> 20:19.970
you've already been involved at
that school.

20:20.030 --> 20:23.020
The way you did damage control
there was very smooth.

20:23.020 --> 20:26.000
Listening to you, it really was
like that...

20:28.160 --> 20:29.990
We'll discuss the details
on the way.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.460
Let's get going.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.980
We don't have much time left,
huh?

20:34.500 --> 20:37.330
What are you doing?
Hurry up and go.

20:38.930 --> 20:39.900
Okay.

20:39.900 --> 20:43.360
- We're leaving.
- We'll be back soon!

20:43.570 --> 20:44.670
Hey!

20:44.780 --> 20:48.510
Where are you kids going already
this morning?

21:04.490 --> 21:07.510
Team Leader Han Na Yeong.

21:09.260 --> 21:12.000
Watch out criminals.

21:16.970 --> 21:18.440
Who did you find?

21:18.440 --> 21:20.270
Huh? Oh, nothing.

21:20.270 --> 21:21.380
What about Han Ji Su?

21:21.380 --> 21:25.780
They said in the lounge, she got
some flowers from an anonymous
person, and then she got hurt.

21:25.780 --> 21:28.180
Fortunately, it wasn't serious
and could be treated.

21:28.210 --> 21:29.080
A flower?

21:29.080 --> 21:32.750
It's very rare, an exotic species
of flower.

21:32.750 --> 21:37.730
They're extremely toxic and if
the flowers touch the skin, it will
cause burns.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.960
There are flowers like that?

21:41.380 --> 21:43.610
Good work.

21:44.870 --> 21:45.970
What?

21:45.970 --> 21:46.700
Nothing.

21:46.700 --> 21:50.000
I'll go check the CCTV of the
auditorium.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.710
Is that true?

21:57.710 --> 21:59.550
You guys don't remember?

21:59.550 --> 22:03.030
The same thing happened at
this time last year.

22:03.110 --> 22:05.790
I also heard one of the alumni
students say

22:05.790 --> 22:10.560
that a very talented girl committed
suicide 7 years ago and hasn't
left the school yet.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.230
On the anniversary of her death,
she possesses someone's body.

22:14.230 --> 22:16.430
Hey, that's bad luck.

22:16.430 --> 22:18.020
Stop.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.840
Then that happened to Han Ji Su
yesterday, too.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.180
Did you see her hands?

22:22.670 --> 22:24.510
It's too horrible to think about.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.710
All of you girls! Why are you
chatting instead of listening to
the lesson?

22:26.710 --> 22:31.810
You know the competition is
coming up, right?
You're still noisy?

22:42.860 --> 22:46.320
This is the report related to that.

22:46.370 --> 22:48.450
Good. Thank you.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.160
There was nothing special you
remember?

22:56.190 --> 22:59.740
Back then, her family kept
saying,

22:59.740 --> 23:01.330
she had no reason to commit
suicide.

23:01.370 --> 23:04.880
So we talked to her friends and
did an extensive investigation.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.350
At that time,

23:06.350 --> 23:13.300
there were some rumors that she
was dating an older man, had
gotten pregnant, etc.

23:13.510 --> 23:15.130
When we checked later,

23:15.160 --> 23:19.000
we found the deceased went
frequently to a hospital with an
OB/GYN department,

23:19.020 --> 23:21.410
so there were rumors like that.

23:22.130 --> 23:26.500
Also at that time, relationships
with her friends had deteriorated.

23:26.650 --> 23:29.100
These days they call it
being crowded out.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.770
Did Hye Mi send a text message
to her friends before she died?

23:32.770 --> 23:34.610
Did she talk to anyone
on the roof?

23:34.610 --> 23:37.430
She did send 3 of them a text
message,

23:37.550 --> 23:39.800
but none of them went.

23:40.110 --> 23:43.600
One hour after that, she jumped
off and died.

23:44.580 --> 23:45.890
Then...

23:45.990 --> 23:48.190
there weren't any witnesses?

23:48.190 --> 23:50.390
One student said,

23:50.390 --> 23:55.900
they saw one of her friends on
the stairs to the rooftop, so we
investigated.

23:55.900 --> 23:56.630
<i>Why did they call her out?</i>

23:56.630 --> 23:57.730
<i>Is she the killer?</i>

23:57.730 --> 23:58.690
<i>Oh, seriously.</i>

23:58.710 --> 23:59.930
<i>How could that be?</i>

24:01.930 --> 24:07.910
<i>She said after she got the text,
she went out. But halfway there,
she changed her mind.</i>

24:08.310 --> 24:10.720
<i>Who was that student we
investigated?</i>

24:10.770 --> 24:12.640
Why are you asking about
Hye Mi?

24:12.660 --> 24:14.290
How pitiful she must be.

24:14.440 --> 24:17.180
She must feel very wronged
to never have left the school.

24:17.180 --> 24:21.590
What I meant was, if there has
been an injustice, we must
thoroughly investigate.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.740
That's why I'm asking.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.090
I'm sorry.

24:27.090 --> 24:31.380
Just thinking about that still
gives me nightmares.

24:31.870 --> 24:37.570
Back then, I was compiling exam
questions, so I left work late.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.070
<i>I still can't believe... </i>

24:40.440 --> 24:42.880
that Hye Mi would commit suicide.

24:43.060 --> 24:48.020
But what motivated Hye Mi
to kill herself?

24:48.020 --> 24:52.910
One week before, there was a
very important concert.

25:10.040 --> 25:14.440
<i>Hye Mi was chosen to participate
in the national competition.</i>

25:14.440 --> 25:17.170
<i>It was the last time she ever
played.</i>

25:17.520 --> 25:22.520
<i>I'm not sure if she wasn't well,
or if the pressure was too much,</i>

25:22.880 --> 25:26.360
<i>but unlike her, she just kept
making mistakes.</i>

25:26.550 --> 25:28.760
There were great expectations
surrounding her.

25:28.760 --> 25:34.260
Such a terrible performance
like that must have devastated
her.

25:34.260 --> 25:39.400
After Hye Mi died, Han Ji Su
became school president, right?

25:39.570 --> 25:42.500
Yes, that's right.

25:43.070 --> 25:45.640
Ji Su also replaced Hye Mi
in the competition.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.480
She eventually won first place.

25:47.480 --> 25:54.080
I heard that among her friends,
one was suspected. Then...

25:54.080 --> 25:56.650
Who was that student we
investigated?

25:56.650 --> 25:57.750
It must be written in there.

25:57.750 --> 25:58.600
Oh, yes.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.920
Song Da Jeong.

26:10.810 --> 26:16.690
Someone said they saw Da Jeong
on the stairs to the rooftop,

26:17.030 --> 26:19.040
so she was investigated.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.290
<i>Da Jeong? Song Da Jeong.</i>

26:22.170 --> 26:27.480
<i>Da Jeong was also running for
school president at that time, </i>

26:27.480 --> 26:30.420
<i>so there was suspicion about that.</i>

26:30.420 --> 26:34.780
Number 2 was jealous of
Number 1's ability.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.700
Like Mozart and Sal...

26:39.230 --> 26:40.990
Sal...

26:41.060 --> 26:43.300
Salieri!

26:45.470 --> 26:48.690
There were a lot of strong
suspects, weren't there?

26:48.770 --> 26:52.810
<i>I think Da Jeong was also
a victim.</i>

26:52.810 --> 26:57.580
After police investigated her,
people were pointing at her.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.510
So during that important time,
she was having mood swings.

27:00.510 --> 27:05.250
<i>Eventually Ji Su participated in
the competition final.</i>

27:19.940 --> 27:22.640
Teacher Song Da Jeong?

27:24.740 --> 27:25.840
Yes?

27:29.610 --> 27:32.070
Those were good times.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.800
I also had times like that once.

27:40.890 --> 27:42.890
Thank you.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.070
It smells good.

27:49.330 --> 27:52.010
I'm not sure where to begin.

27:54.010 --> 27:55.940
That time,

27:55.940 --> 27:58.870
you were investigated by the
police.

27:59.000 --> 27:59.970
Yes.

28:00.100 --> 28:04.380
But like I said before, I never
saw Hye Mi that day.

28:04.380 --> 28:09.350
But why did someone say they
saw you on the stairs to the roof?

28:09.520 --> 28:11.720
I also wonder who said that,

28:11.720 --> 28:13.920
and why they did.

28:14.450 --> 28:18.330
I think the mutual suspicion
just caused a mess.

28:19.660 --> 28:21.260
So...

28:22.000 --> 28:26.190
what was going on between
your friends?

28:28.000 --> 28:31.170
<i>You didn't make this!</i>

28:31.170 --> 28:32.270
<i>I'll wipe this on you!</i>

28:32.270 --> 28:34.020
<i>What are you doing?</i>

29:04.840 --> 29:07.490
<i>The four of us were very close,</i>

29:07.880 --> 29:10.810
<i>but Ji Su and Hye Mi were
especially close.</i>

29:10.810 --> 29:14.850
Back then, Ji Su was very shy
and had no self-confidence.

29:14.850 --> 29:16.320
<i>This one's pretty.</i>

29:16.320 --> 29:18.520
<i>So Hye Mi always watched out
for Ji Su.</i>

29:18.520 --> 29:19.620
<i>How about this one?</i>

29:19.620 --> 29:21.460
<i>Should we each get one?</i>

29:21.460 --> 29:23.660
<i>Are you buying?</i>

29:23.660 --> 29:25.860
<i>Pick one out for Hye Mi.</i>

29:25.860 --> 29:26.960
<i>Okay.</i>

29:26.960 --> 29:30.630
Ga Yeong was pretty and had a
good family,

29:30.630 --> 29:34.670
so she attracted attention
everywhere she went, but...

29:34.670 --> 29:35.770
<i>Auntie.</i>

29:35.770 --> 29:36.870
<i>Hello.</i>

29:36.870 --> 29:39.810
<i>Drink this while you work.</i>

29:40.540 --> 29:42.010
<i>That's Hye Mi over there.</i>

29:42.010 --> 29:43.840
<i>Hye Mi!</i>

29:46.410 --> 29:48.250
<i>What are you all doing here?</i>

29:48.250 --> 29:51.550
<i>These are my friends.</i>

29:53.390 --> 29:55.590
<i>I have to go now.</i>

29:55.590 --> 29:59.630
<i>I forgot there's something I have
to do at home.</i>

29:59.630 --> 30:03.660
<i>Hey, Yu Ga Yeong!
Where are you going?</i>

30:03.660 --> 30:05.870
Nobody knew.

30:05.870 --> 30:12.470
Ga Yeong's family had gone
bankrupt and were up to their
butts in debt.

30:12.470 --> 30:15.410
We also found out later,

30:15.410 --> 30:22.750
Ga Yeong's mother worked as a
cleaner with Hye Mi at a
convenience store.

30:22.750 --> 30:25.320
<i>I heard her family went bankrupt.</i>

30:25.320 --> 30:27.890
<i>What is she showing off when her
mother is just a janitor?</i>

30:27.890 --> 30:30.820
<i>She's not even that pretty.</i>

30:33.760 --> 30:36.330
<i>She works at a convenience store...</i>

30:37.430 --> 30:39.630
<i>Actually, I do too.</i>

30:44.040 --> 30:50.280
<i>Maybe Ga Yeong thought Hye Mi
was talking about her.</i>

30:50.280 --> 30:55.420
When Hye Mi was selected for
the competition, the day before
it, Ga Yeong said,

30:55.420 --> 30:58.350
<i>I think Hye Mi has been taking
medicine lately.</i>

30:58.350 --> 31:00.190
<i>She's not sick is she?</i>

31:00.190 --> 31:02.020
<i>She said it's for allergies.</i>

31:02.020 --> 31:03.490
<i>Is that medicine?</i>

31:03.490 --> 31:05.330
<i>Really?</i>

31:10.180 --> 31:13.400
<i>I knew this guy who had
hay fever.</i>

31:13.400 --> 31:15.240
<i>We decided to go to the park
together.</i>

31:15.240 --> 31:22.580
<i>But he forgot to bring his medicine
and got red all over and was
itching everywhere.</i>

31:22.580 --> 31:24.780
<i>It was so gross to look at him.</i>

31:24.780 --> 31:27.350
<i>It was funny.</i>

31:27.710 --> 31:29.920
<i>But,</i>

31:29.920 --> 31:37.620
<i>if Hye Mi didn't take her medicine,
would that also happen to her?</i>

31:39.830 --> 31:47.170
<i>It's really cold today, so I should
get going.</i>

31:49.000 --> 31:52.670
<i>None of us ever said it,
but we all knew. </i>

31:52.670 --> 31:57.440
<i>Someone actually switched her
medicine bottle.</i>

31:57.440 --> 32:00.010
Don't tell me...

32:00.510 --> 32:03.450
Yu Ga Yeong?

32:12.990 --> 32:14.460
Did you want to see me?

32:14.460 --> 32:15.930
Are you Director Yu Ga Yeong?

32:15.930 --> 32:18.870
Yes. What do you need?

32:22.540 --> 32:26.210
By offering Art Dream Tree
scholarship programs,

32:26.210 --> 32:28.410
you're doing meaningful work.

32:28.410 --> 32:32.450
While I was waiting for you just
now, I was looking around.

32:32.450 --> 32:36.850
Actually, I came here because
I wanted to be a famous pianist.

32:36.850 --> 32:41.990
My family circumstances changed,
so I gave up that dream.
That's my excuse.

32:42.170 --> 32:44.560
That should be enough, right?

32:44.560 --> 32:46.030
-=Yu Ga Yeong=-

32:46.030 --> 32:52.500
It seems someone like you could
be the next Han Ji Su.

32:54.470 --> 32:57.400
Ji Su requested an investigation,
right?

32:57.400 --> 33:01.440
It's not only about that.

33:03.640 --> 33:07.530
We're reinvestigating the
death of Yang Hye Mi.

33:08.780 --> 33:15.390
Back then, you told police you
saw Song Da Jeong on the stairs
to the rooftop.

33:15.390 --> 33:18.320
For that reason, she was
investigated by the police.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.280
And so?

33:19.290 --> 33:24.560
We heard you two were close
friends, but I guess not that close.

33:24.760 --> 33:29.700
Da Jeong has a lot of pride,
so she's not very open.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.540
She wanted to be the best.

33:31.740 --> 33:34.840
<i>The student who will participate
in the competition is...</i>

33:34.950 --> 33:38.210
<i>Congratulations... Yang Hye Mi.</i>

33:44.020 --> 33:47.320
<i>Okay, let's start class.</i>

33:47.320 --> 33:50.620
<i>Let's go back to where we left off.</i>

33:50.620 --> 33:53.190
<i>It's okay.</i>

33:55.030 --> 33:56.860
<i>You played well. </i>

33:59.800 --> 34:07.140
I didn't say anything at that time,
but I think someone must have
switched her medicine.

34:07.140 --> 34:09.340
<i>I have something to tell all of you.</i>

34:09.510 --> 34:13.870
<i>I'll wait for you on the rooftop
after practice.</i>

34:15.949 --> 34:18.300
<i>I have to go to the academy.</i>

34:18.889 --> 34:22.190
<i>You go listen to what she has
to say. </i>

34:22.560 --> 34:24.310
<i>Okay.</i>

34:32.100 --> 34:35.510
After Hye Mi died, about
one month later,

34:35.580 --> 34:39.070
I asked Da Jeong once,

34:39.070 --> 34:41.639
<i>You switched her medicine,
didn't you?</i>

34:42.010 --> 34:46.780
<i>You were afraid that thing would
be exposed, so you hurt Hye Mi?</i>

34:46.780 --> 34:50.080
<i>You thought Hye Mi told everyone
your family went bankrupt, so you
hated her.</i>

34:50.080 --> 34:53.510
<i>You even said that you hoped
Hye Mi would disappear!</i>

34:54.120 --> 34:57.230
<i>Don't think that you can put
this all on me. </i>

35:02.380 --> 35:05.970
<i>She got angry with me instead.</i>

35:26.790 --> 35:32.660
At that time, I didn't know...
that I had misunderstood.

35:32.660 --> 35:38.810
That bracelet. All four of us had
exactly the same one.

35:39.250 --> 35:42.860
Da Jeong was wearing her
bracelet.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.720
Hye Mi was also wearing hers.

36:03.580 --> 36:07.150
<i>Yang Hyeon Mu.
Be sure to find him.</i>

36:07.710 --> 36:10.780
I feel full just looking at this photo.

36:15.230 --> 36:17.210
I'm hungry.

36:18.410 --> 36:21.090
You want something?
I'm getting takeout.

36:24.040 --> 36:29.480
Do you happen to know anything
about the Department Chief?

36:32.850 --> 36:38.030
I heard that when he was at
headquarters, he was rising very
quickly.

36:38.360 --> 36:43.500
Things were going great and he
was expected to be appointed to
Department Chief.

36:43.500 --> 36:47.900
He was nothing like he is now.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.570
But in the end, everything just
collapsed.

36:51.570 --> 36:53.770
You know about the An Jae Min
case, right?

36:53.770 --> 36:56.710
The Golden Chopsticks serial
murder suspect.

36:56.710 --> 36:59.280
He was released because of
insufficient evidence.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.950
In order to investigate the case,
he offended some higher-ups,

37:02.950 --> 37:05.880
and hit rock bottom overnight.

37:09.070 --> 37:10.070
But,

37:10.150 --> 37:11.760
why are you suddenly asking
about the Department Chief?

37:11.760 --> 37:14.050
Oh, it's just, well...

37:15.600 --> 37:16.830
But,

37:16.890 --> 37:18.840
where did all the kids go?

37:19.830 --> 37:26.110
Earlier, Detective Jeong said
something and then dragged
them out.

37:26.570 --> 37:30.640
<i>I don't need your permission to
do my own investigation!</i>

37:31.940 --> 37:34.880
That high school student, seriously.

37:37.450 --> 37:38.920
Where are you going?

37:38.920 --> 37:41.490
I was going to order takeout.

37:41.490 --> 37:44.790
Why is there so much traffic?

37:44.790 --> 37:46.990
I don't have time for this.

37:46.990 --> 37:50.660
Could Han Ji Su really be the
murderer like Jong Hyeon
seonbae said?

37:50.660 --> 37:56.900
She's going abroad tomorrow.
I don't think we have time.

37:56.900 --> 37:57.640
-=Yun Cheo Yong seonbae=-

37:57.640 --> 37:59.840
The Crazy Ghost.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.410
Why does he always call?

38:02.410 --> 38:04.980
Did he see?

38:07.550 --> 38:08.650
He---

38:09.380 --> 38:12.320
I was just investigating a suspect.

38:12.320 --> 38:16.720
Hey, high school student.
Hurry and get back here.

38:17.820 --> 38:20.390
High school student?
What high school student?

38:20.390 --> 38:22.960
Fine, then you can come and
get me! Bye!

38:22.960 --> 38:25.530
Hey, high school student!

38:27.000 --> 38:29.570
Ah, really.

38:30.670 --> 38:31.770
Who was that?

38:31.770 --> 38:34.710
Some jerkface guy.

38:34.710 --> 38:36.910
We don't have much time.

38:36.910 --> 38:38.380
Speed up.

38:40.210 --> 38:45.170
Yes. Luckily, there were no
problems with the nerves or
muscles,

38:45.170 --> 38:48.800
so the operation should go
smoothly.

38:51.590 --> 38:56.860
Yes. We will do our best to
proceed on a timely schedule.

39:01.950 --> 39:03.700
What are you doing?

39:03.700 --> 39:05.540
It's too stuffy. I'm going
shopping.

39:05.540 --> 39:06.640
You can't yet.

39:06.640 --> 39:07.740
Where are you going with
your hand like that?

39:07.740 --> 39:09.940
Reporters have already caught
the scent and are calling.

39:09.940 --> 39:11.780
You're worried about that at a
time like this?

39:11.780 --> 39:13.610
Shall I tell you what the real
situation is?

39:13.610 --> 39:16.180
If the other party seeks
compensation again,

39:16.180 --> 39:20.220
all the aid and competition prize
money you've received, all of it...

39:20.220 --> 39:22.050
That would be even better.

39:22.050 --> 39:26.510
Through all this, everyone
might rediscover me.

39:34.530 --> 39:37.840
The doctor told her to keep
absolutely quiet.

39:37.840 --> 39:41.140
Yes, well, absolute quiet is very
important.

39:41.140 --> 39:41.870
But,

39:41.870 --> 39:46.650
I need to ask her a few questions,
just for a moment.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.850
I don't want to make a big deal
out of this case.

39:48.850 --> 39:51.420
Please leave.

39:53.110 --> 39:58.490
<i>That, I understand what
you mean.</i>

40:00.450 --> 40:02.510
Who are you?

40:07.200 --> 40:09.090
How is your hand now?

40:09.130 --> 40:10.870
Come on, you can tell me.

40:10.870 --> 40:12.340
I want to rest.

40:12.340 --> 40:15.270
Yesterday, I already talked to
the other detective.

40:15.270 --> 40:17.480
I'm here about another case.

40:17.480 --> 40:21.510
Hye Mi was your best friend,
right?

40:21.510 --> 40:27.020
I heard someone was on the
rooftop before Hye Mi died.

40:27.020 --> 40:29.960
So what, you don't have
anything to say?

40:29.960 --> 40:31.420
Who said that?

40:31.420 --> 40:32.890
What are you doing?

40:32.890 --> 40:33.990
Leave right now!

40:33.990 --> 40:35.460
Detective Jeong.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.500
I'm short on time, too.
One more minute.

40:39.500 --> 40:42.440
Why don't you just talk to me, huh?
Now!

40:42.440 --> 40:45.000
Leave. Otherwise, I'm calling
the police.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.470
Geez, you're so grumpy!

40:46.470 --> 40:47.940
I'm leaving already!

40:47.940 --> 40:50.880
Just calm down!

40:52.350 --> 40:55.650
I'm sorry.

41:00.420 --> 41:03.720
<i>I heard someone was on the
rooftop before Hye Mi died.</i>

41:03.720 --> 41:07.510
<i>So what, you don't have
anything to say?</i>

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
<i>We're back.</i>

41:15.840 --> 41:21.040
Hey. What are you guys doing
out wandering around?

41:21.070 --> 41:22.810
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

41:22.810 --> 41:23.660
<i>No.</i>

41:23.690 --> 41:27.580
<i>Like searching for some damn
golden toad, we had to rush
everywhere.</i>

41:27.580 --> 41:29.050
<i>Tae Gyeong, we need to eat.</i>

41:29.050 --> 41:29.760
<i>Yes.</i>

41:29.780 --> 41:33.120
First, tell the Team Leader
about our case, okay?

41:35.810 --> 41:37.940
What are you all waiting for?

41:46.300 --> 41:52.670
Whoever was on the rooftop with
that student when she died is the
key to this.

41:52.910 --> 41:56.940
We can't tell which one of these
here knows the truth.

41:56.940 --> 42:00.980
From the old crime scene, was
there any more evidence?

42:00.980 --> 42:04.280
I heard there was something like
torn sheet music in her hand.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.290
Sheet music?

42:05.380 --> 42:06.280
<i>Yes.</i>

42:06.330 --> 42:10.160
The rest of it was never found
in the area.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.150
Maybe the wind blew it away.

42:12.230 --> 42:17.980
Anyway, go ask the National
Forensic Lab to look over the old
evidence again.

42:18.230 --> 42:23.370
But, with Han Ji Su...
who did that?

42:23.370 --> 42:27.410
Anyway, back then, Yang Hye Mi
used to take allergy medicine.

42:27.410 --> 42:30.710
Someone switched the bottle
to ruin her performance.

42:30.710 --> 42:33.650
It became an important reason
for her death.

42:33.650 --> 42:40.250
When they got together 7 years
later, one of them sent Han Ji Su
some poisonous flowers.

42:40.250 --> 42:42.460
<i>That's how her hands were injured.</i>

42:42.460 --> 42:45.020
What about it?
Isn't it consistent?

42:45.020 --> 42:50.160
Could it have been done by
someone who believes Han Ji Su
killed Yang Hye Mi?

42:50.160 --> 42:54.570
In other words, someone who
knows the truth about the past.

42:54.570 --> 42:57.870
But, it's a little unreasonable.

42:57.870 --> 43:00.810
Song Da Jeong is jealous.
Yu Ga Yeong misunderstood.

43:00.810 --> 43:04.110
Even if there was a motive to
kill Yang Hye Mi,

43:04.110 --> 43:09.520
Han Ji Su had no real reason.

43:10.720 --> 43:13.650
Detective Jeong, don't you think...

43:13.650 --> 43:16.980
That's right. Even in that case...

43:17.320 --> 43:21.730
What? When did I pop out?

43:21.730 --> 43:23.490
Detective Jeong!

43:23.660 --> 43:26.630
Detective Jeong, how can you
fall asleep?

43:27.230 --> 43:30.280
Aigoo, really.

43:30.900 --> 43:34.210
<i>Now that we talked about this,
let's eat our food.</i>

43:34.210 --> 43:37.140
Detective Jeong and I will go to
the forensic lab.

43:37.140 --> 43:38.610
We'll be back.

43:56.600 --> 44:01.330
Seonbaenim, I need to talk to you.

44:04.630 --> 44:07.290
Please tell me the truth.

44:08.010 --> 44:14.520
The spirit that keeps possessing
me, you know who it is, don't you?

44:16.050 --> 44:19.480
Go ahead. Tell her.

44:19.720 --> 44:23.920
No, don't tell her! She might
not let me in next time!

44:24.490 --> 44:28.670
Oh, I don't know.
Do whatever you want.

44:29.470 --> 44:31.050
Here.

44:33.300 --> 44:37.340
Except for two times, the possessions
were during an investigation.

44:37.340 --> 44:42.340
After that, we find important
clues and solve the case.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.490
Could someone related to
the police, I mean...

44:47.290 --> 44:49.190
be the spirit?

44:51.500 --> 44:53.490
Please tell me.

44:53.490 --> 44:55.660
I'll really be fine.

45:01.190 --> 45:03.400
Are you going to stay here
like this?

45:03.400 --> 45:07.060
Why? Just talk in front of me!

45:10.870 --> 45:12.580
Okay.

45:20.650 --> 45:22.850
She's the spirit of a high school
student.

45:22.850 --> 45:26.150
She appeared when I was in
the Wide Area Search Team.

45:26.150 --> 45:29.460
Wide Area Search Team?

45:30.920 --> 45:33.130
So she knows all of the team
members.

45:33.130 --> 45:35.690
To say this about a spirit is a
little odd,

45:35.690 --> 45:39.370
but she's kind and very
passionate.

45:39.370 --> 45:44.500
Sometimes she overestimates
her abilities and causes trouble.

45:44.500 --> 45:49.280
I'll tell her to be more careful in
the future, so don't worry.

45:49.280 --> 45:57.350
To have a guardian angel around
me seems very practical.

45:57.350 --> 45:58.820
Thank you.

45:58.820 --> 46:02.860
I appreciate your honesty.

46:02.860 --> 46:07.260
Let's keep this a secret from
the team members.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.370
Did you tell her?

46:19.370 --> 46:20.470
What did she say?

46:20.470 --> 46:21.210
What now?

46:21.210 --> 46:22.310
She won't let me possess her?

46:22.310 --> 46:23.780
What are you so curious about?

46:23.780 --> 46:26.350
I need to know what she said!

46:26.350 --> 46:31.480
The thought of anyone besides
you knowing about me makes me
nervous. It's so weird.

46:31.480 --> 46:33.690
<i>I wanted to hide.</i>

46:33.690 --> 46:35.890
Did you tell her what I look like?

46:35.890 --> 46:37.720
You said I was pretty, right?

46:37.720 --> 46:40.660
Didn't she want to see my
photo or anything?

46:40.660 --> 46:42.130
Is this a blind date?

46:42.130 --> 46:44.330
I said you were an ugly, bad-
tempered high school student,

46:44.330 --> 46:45.430
so she didn't care.

46:45.430 --> 46:46.900
Satisfied?

46:46.900 --> 46:48.730
Seriously!

46:48.730 --> 46:50.940
That's not what you really said,
right?

46:50.940 --> 46:53.510
I'm really going to find out!

46:56.440 --> 46:58.640
I've been at the National Forensic
Lab for over 15 years,

46:58.640 --> 47:02.310
but this is the first time I've had
just a photo and no body.

47:02.310 --> 47:04.150
How does it look to you?

47:04.150 --> 47:07.820
It's very hard to be sure just
from a photo.

47:07.820 --> 47:10.760
But the body does look a bit
like that.

47:10.760 --> 47:11.490
Really?

47:11.490 --> 47:14.060
Just as the hospital records
show the cause of death,

47:14.060 --> 47:17.360
there was indeed a serious head
injury.

47:17.360 --> 47:20.670
But right here, you can see an
injury to the ankle, right?

47:20.670 --> 47:22.870
It could be a scratch made by
branches as she was falling,

47:22.870 --> 47:25.070
but it goes upward from the ankle.

47:25.070 --> 47:28.740
In other words, it's very likely
she didn't land head-first.

47:28.740 --> 47:33.150
So, there may have been a
serious ankle fracture.

47:33.150 --> 47:36.450
We have to look at this next one.

47:36.450 --> 47:37.190
I don't...

47:41.590 --> 47:45.990
Aigoo. It looks like you must
have talked to your daughter on
the phone.

47:45.990 --> 47:49.660
What? Did she charm you into
sending her money again?

47:49.660 --> 47:51.500
Daddy, I love you.

47:51.500 --> 47:54.800
Send me some money - in dollars.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.740
Jerk.

47:58.100 --> 47:59.940
Did you find something?

47:59.940 --> 48:04.710
We haven't found anything
obvious.

48:04.710 --> 48:06.550
That woman, that woman.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.380
It's Yu Ga Yeong. Zoom in.

48:08.380 --> 48:09.850
Why? Do you see something?

48:09.850 --> 48:13.520
It's very difficult for an ordinary
person to purchase poisonous
plants, so how did she get it?

48:13.520 --> 48:19.760
I checked and Hwayeon Financial
Group sponsors an environmental
protection research institute.

48:19.760 --> 48:21.230
I have a feeling.

48:21.230 --> 48:22.330
Wait a second. Stop!

48:22.330 --> 48:25.630
The building windows.

48:28.570 --> 48:31.500
That... isn't Yu Ga Yeong walking
past.

48:31.500 --> 48:33.340
What do you mean, Kid?

48:33.340 --> 48:35.170
That looks just like her.

48:35.170 --> 48:37.380
Yes, yes. It looks just like her.

48:37.380 --> 48:42.510
That woman has 2 arms, 2 legs
and one head.

48:44.720 --> 48:48.750
It really seems like I've seen
her somewhere before.

48:48.750 --> 48:49.860
Tae Gyeong.

48:49.860 --> 48:53.160
Look there in that car window.

48:55.730 --> 48:57.560
Here...

48:57.560 --> 48:58.660
What was that?

49:07.110 --> 49:10.410
It's Han Ji Su.

49:11.880 --> 49:15.550
What? What? What is this?

49:52.620 --> 49:54.450
Hye Mi.

49:59.590 --> 50:01.430
Han Ji Su.

50:09.200 --> 50:11.280
Clearly Yang Hye Mi was with
someone up on the rooftop. That person is our most likely
suspect.

50:11.280 --> 50:14.580
That's something that will be
difficult to prove.

50:14.580 --> 50:17.150
No one is willing to tell the truth.

50:17.150 --> 50:20.090
In any case, I think we should
talk to her friends again.

50:20.090 --> 50:22.100
They said Han Ji Su is going
abroad tomorrow.

50:28.100 --> 50:29.000
Yes, Detective Han.
They said Han Ji Su is going
abroad tomorrow.

50:29.000 --> 50:29.830
Yes, Detective Han.

50:30.990 --> 50:32.430
Where?

50:34.400 --> 50:35.900
Okay.

51:02.450 --> 51:05.330
This Hye Mi, where the heck
is she hiding?

51:05.360 --> 51:08.980
I need to see her so I can
figure out some things.

51:12.940 --> 51:15.140
Why are you bothering a busy
person?

51:15.150 --> 51:16.360
What is it you want to say?

51:16.390 --> 51:20.550
You told the police you saw me
on the rooftop, right?

51:20.580 --> 51:22.120
That's why you called me here?

51:22.120 --> 51:24.690
You thought I killed Hye Mi?

51:24.690 --> 51:25.790
Why?

51:25.790 --> 51:30.920
Hye Mi's competition music, didn't
you always practice it together?

51:30.920 --> 51:33.860
You thought if Hye Mi wasn't
around, you'd be able to compete.

51:33.860 --> 51:36.800
So it was you who switched her
medicine wasn't it?

51:36.950 --> 51:39.730
Your plan worked out perfectly.

51:39.730 --> 51:45.240
After that incident, instead of a
duck in Hye Mi's shadow, you
became a swan.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.070
Believe whatever you want.

51:47.070 --> 51:48.180
You were always like that.

51:48.180 --> 51:52.950
You don't care what anyone
thinks, you go your own way.

51:52.950 --> 51:55.520
Let me ask you one thing.

51:55.520 --> 51:59.920
After I came down, you really
didn't go up to the rooftop, right?

51:59.920 --> 52:02.120
What?

52:04.690 --> 52:06.160
Why?

52:06.160 --> 52:09.100
Did you get worried after
thinking about it?

52:09.100 --> 52:10.560
Afraid you left behind some
evidence?

52:10.560 --> 52:13.500
I told you, believe whatever
you want.

52:13.500 --> 52:17.910
Don't worry. There wasn't
anything.

52:17.910 --> 52:19.740
Because I hate troublesome
things the most.

52:19.740 --> 52:21.580
That's enough, right?

52:21.580 --> 52:25.250
Do you have anything else
to say?

52:34.790 --> 52:39.610
That's right. I did that.

52:40.290 --> 52:43.750
I just thought I was wasting
myself.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.010
I thought school was the best
stage.

52:47.090 --> 52:54.980
After winning the competition on
behalf of Hye Mi, I didn't want to
give it all up, so I kept struggling.

52:54.980 --> 52:59.100
Since then and until now,
my heart hasn't been easy.

52:59.170 --> 53:02.680
If I don't take medicine, I can't
even sleep at night.

53:02.790 --> 53:07.960
I just wanted to let go of
everything no matter what.

53:09.530 --> 53:12.210
But I didn't have the courage.

53:13.970 --> 53:17.400
After graduation, I never came
back to this school.

53:17.730 --> 53:21.030
When I was contacted about
this event at the school,

53:21.260 --> 53:28.620
I saw the date was Sept. 18,
Hye Mi's death anniversary.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.650
That's when I decided.

53:30.690 --> 53:34.620
Just like back then, I would
suffer the same as Hye Mi did.

53:34.620 --> 53:36.950
What exactly happened 7
years ago?

53:37.000 --> 53:40.020
Hye Mi was selected as school
president.

53:41.180 --> 53:45.830
I accidentally overheard Hye Mi
and the teacher talking in the
music classroom.

53:46.170 --> 53:49.770
<i>What do you mean you're not
participating?</i>

53:50.060 --> 53:52.870
<i>Actually, something happened
in my family. </i>

53:52.880 --> 53:55.050
<i>What in the world is this?</i>

53:55.400 --> 53:56.520
<i>Tell me.</i>

53:56.540 --> 53:58.250
<i>Is there some other reason
for this?</i>

53:58.280 --> 54:00.310
<i>No, it's absolutely not like that.</i>

54:00.310 --> 54:03.770
<i>We've already announced the
music, so it will be difficult to
change.</i>

54:03.790 --> 54:07.650
<i>That song, I practice it every day
with Ji Su.</i>

54:07.650 --> 54:12.050
<i>Ji Su can also play it well, so just
let her go to the competition.</i>

54:12.050 --> 54:15.030
<i>This girl, why are you trying to
upset me...</i>

54:15.220 --> 54:18.610
<i>Let's just keep getting ready,
okay?</i>

54:19.030 --> 54:23.430
<i>At that time, I really couldn't
understand why she said that. </i>

54:23.430 --> 54:29.020
But after Hye Mi messed up her
performance, I got a strange
idea.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.300
If I did well, maybe I could go
to the competition.

54:35.840 --> 54:39.840
That way, maybe I could also
have a chance.

54:45.720 --> 54:47.260
<i>You came?</i>

54:48.160 --> 54:50.350
<i>What about Da Jeong and
Ga Yeong?</i>

54:50.380 --> 54:51.690
<i>They aren't coming?</i>

54:51.710 --> 54:54.000
<i>I don't know. Maybe they don't
want to.</i>

54:54.630 --> 54:56.100
<i>Congratulations, Ji Su.</i>

54:56.100 --> 54:57.930
<i>You can go to the competition.</i>

54:57.930 --> 55:00.500
<i>I just heard about it.
You must be happy.</i>

55:00.500 --> 55:02.010
<i>Why would I?</i>

55:02.340 --> 55:04.170
<i>It's all thanks to you.</i>

55:04.170 --> 55:06.370
<i>You want me to thank you,
is that it?</i>

55:06.370 --> 55:08.210
<i>No. That's not what I meant. </i>

55:08.210 --> 55:09.680
<i>Then why should I be happy?</i>

55:09.680 --> 55:12.020
<i>Do think it's unfair that you lost
because you messed up?</i>

55:12.060 --> 55:14.450
<i>Then complain and have it
investigated! </i>

55:14.450 --> 55:16.790
<i>Just please stop being so nice
about it!</i>

55:20.620 --> 55:23.020
<i>Ji Su, wait a minute.</i>

55:24.300 --> 55:26.220
<i>Actually,</i>

55:27.550 --> 55:30.960
<i>- in a few days, I'm going abroad.
- Abroad?</i>

55:30.960 --> 55:33.630
<i>Yes. That's how it is. </i>

55:34.020 --> 55:37.490
<i>Because of my father's job,
my whole family is going. </i>

55:37.940 --> 55:40.750
<i>I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.</i>

55:41.060 --> 55:42.930
<i>Ji Su, this.</i>

55:43.190 --> 55:44.710
<i>What is this?</i>

55:44.910 --> 55:46.750
<i>Didn't we make a promise?</i>

55:46.750 --> 55:50.420
<i>No matter when or where we
meet, we'll play this together.</i>

55:50.560 --> 55:52.620
<i>This is my new arrangement. </i>

55:52.620 --> 55:56.000
<i>What we played wrong before,
I fixed so we can play together.</i>

55:56.100 --> 55:58.860
<i>Even after I go there, I won't
ever give up.</i>

55:58.860 --> 56:01.800
<i>I will miss all of you guys so much,
sincerely.</i>

56:01.800 --> 56:03.640
<i>What is this supposed to be?</i>

56:08.840 --> 56:12.810
<i>I was so angry, I started to cry
and just ran away.</i>

56:12.810 --> 56:14.270
That was all.

56:14.270 --> 56:17.700
Later on, I also wondered what
happened to Hye Mi.

56:17.790 --> 56:21.620
Why did you hide meeting with
Hye Mi from the police?

56:21.620 --> 56:23.540
I was going to tell them,

56:26.750 --> 56:34.020
but thinking that Hye Mi might
have died because of me, I got
scared.

56:37.350 --> 56:41.870
Hye Mi, are you really here?

56:42.900 --> 56:46.980
Then just like before, would you
come talk to me?

56:48.090 --> 56:51.260
I have a lot I want to say to you.

57:10.430 --> 57:12.200
Hye Mi.

57:15.200 --> 57:16.670
Don't go, Hye Mi.

57:16.670 --> 57:19.470
I came to help you.

57:19.780 --> 57:26.630
I know how lonely you've been
and how sad.

57:33.230 --> 57:35.530
Can you tell me?

57:35.760 --> 57:39.050
Just what happened to you
that day?

57:57.780 --> 58:05.490
<i>To my very, very dearest friends,
Da Jeong, Ji Su, and Ga Yeong.</i>

58:05.620 --> 58:07.680
<i>Hi everyone.</i>

58:08.330 --> 58:12.200
<i>By the time you read this letter, </i>

58:12.950 --> 58:17.550
<i>I'll probably be in a strange place
and missing all of you.</i>

58:17.690 --> 58:20.640
<i>I'm sorry for not telling you
sooner.</i>

58:20.900 --> 58:25.240
<i>I didn't have the heart to
tell all of you in person,</i>

58:25.470 --> 58:28.270
<i>so I had to write a letter like this.</i>

59:02.830 --> 59:04.580
<i>Da Jeong.</i>

59:05.880 --> 59:07.420
Hye Mi! Hye Mi!

59:09.720 --> 59:12.230
Is that how it was?

59:18.530 --> 59:22.200
You were looking for me.
What did you want to say?

59:22.200 --> 59:23.580
Just...

59:25.500 --> 59:28.800
You talked to the police about
Hye Mi.

59:28.800 --> 59:31.000
What did they ask you about?

59:31.000 --> 59:33.220
We didn't talk about anything
special.

59:34.880 --> 59:38.730
It happened a long time ago,
so it's not easy.

59:40.010 --> 59:43.030
Anyway, I hope it gets better.

59:43.600 --> 59:46.150
Just tell me if there's anything
I can do.

59:46.420 --> 59:47.520
Okay.

59:49.520 --> 59:52.060
It turned out to be an accident.

59:52.660 --> 59:55.230
The friends suspected each
other because they didn't know.

59:55.230 --> 59:57.430
They still carry it around.

59:57.430 --> 01:00:01.030
It doesn't seem like there was
a scuffle, either.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.770
<i>Just as the hospital records
show the cause of death,</i>

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:08.050
<i>there was indeed a serious head
injury.</i>

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.640
You're feeling like that too, right?

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.210
It feels like my chest is too
tight to breathe.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:17.010
Like when you poop and don't
wipe well enough?

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.290
But what's with you two?

01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:24.520
You mean you don't believe
what I said?

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:26.430
Did you find something?

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:29.780
No. Is it just a detective's
intuition?

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.030
You used to spout statistics and
probability.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.340
You've been infected. Infected.

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:40.370
But something seems strange
to me, too.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:45.510
There must have been a reason
she showed me about writing
the letter.

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:51.020
She couldn't bear to tell her
friends, so she wrote a letter.

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.690
Is there some kind of hint in that?

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:56.890
Time machine letter!

01:00:56.890 --> 01:01:01.290
The letter would have gotten to
the school later!

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:08.640
Yes. Like Teacher Yu said, I was
in charge of the mail back then.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.930
Think about it carefully!

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.770
Red Sun!
[hypnotic suggestion catchphrase]

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:17.810
Thinking back, it seems like I
remember something.

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:19.650
Y-You saw that, right?

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:21.670
You saw me hypnotize her,
right?

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:28.230
<i>Hye Mi?</i>

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.760
<i>Because the letter was from a
child who was dead, </i>

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.330
<i>I assumed someone was trying
to pull a prank.</i>

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:36.160
That letter, where is it now?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.670
When there was mail that wasn't
picked up for a long time, we
had a place we put them.

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:44.240
It's been a long time.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.720
This is it.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.010
Here.

01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:07.430
That's it!

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.000
It had a flower on it!

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:19.050
It's from Yang Hye Mi. That's it.

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.800
Oh, there's another one.

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:25.420
This one is to the teacher.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:03.010
<i>Hye Mi was suffering from a
genetic disease, muscular dystrophy.</i>

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.550
Simply put, it's a disease where
the muscles become stiff.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:11.020
In severe cases, the hands and
feet become paralyzed.

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:15.660
Hye Mi's condition was becoming
worse.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:24.000
When the competition came,
Hye Mi was already unable to play
the piano.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.580
<i>Don't be like this. The child
doesn't know yet. </i>

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.380
<i>Let's keep Hye Mi out of the
competition.</i>

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:37.250
<i>My doctor says if I want to get
treatment, I'll have to go abroad.</i>

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:41.770
<i>I made a scene, saying how I had
to stay with all of you. </i>

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:47.490
<i>But as you all know, my mom
and dad only want for me to live. </i>

01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:50.860
<i>I will definitely hurry back after
I'm cured.</i>

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:53.060
<i>You'll all wait for me, right?</i>

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.440
<i>My friends,</i>

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.370
<i>I'm really, really sorry.</i>

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:06.470
Before the competition, the
reason she performed poorly
was probably because of this.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.220
She was never taking any
allergy medication.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.740
It was just a vitamin supplement
for her muscles.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:19.990
So, there was no one who
switched her medicine.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.400
Ajussi, come to the music
classroom quickly!

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.500
Hurry!

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.750
This is the same song.

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:52.530
It's Hye Mi.

01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.010
It has to be.

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:58.030
There must be a reason she
always plays the same song.

01:04:58.030 --> 01:04:59.500
We have to find it.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:03.900
If she's trying to say something
by playing, then...

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.840
Could it be?

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:16.750
Stop that right now!

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:35.100
What is she doing all of a sudden?

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.570
12-23-4.

01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:38.400
-=Chopin Etude, Beethoven
Appassionata, Schubert Impromptu=-

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.340
12-23-4.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:52.720
12, 12.

01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.690
Found it.

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:03.730
Seonbaenim, come look at this.

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:10.270
Wow! As usual, Ha Yun eonni's
skills are really the best!

01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:14.740
But I heard this disappeared on
the rooftop that day.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:15.910
Why is it here?

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.120
Give it to me.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:24.000
The date of the incident was
September 18, 2008.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:29.420
-=Library lending record:
Lee Nan Hui, Sept 5-18, 2008.=-

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:33.200
What's this?

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.560
Then...

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.500
Could it be?

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:43.000
We can't prove a crime just from
this. We have to find a way.

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.370
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.750
Hye Mi wrote this, right?

01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:04.590
It was stuffed inside a
library book.

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:11.840
I... I have some student exams,
so I'll be going.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.980
Stay just a little longer.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:18.970
That day, the first one to find her
and call the police,

01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.450
that was you, wasn't it?

01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:25.570
Why didn't you save her?

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:28.880
What are you talking about?

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.120
Teacher, you weren't the first
to see Hye Mi after she fell.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:38.420
You saw Hye Mi hanging from
the railing on the rooftop,

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.660
isn't that right?

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:40.990
What are you saying?

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.580
Why didn't you save her?

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:52.000
Why... did you hit her in the
head... and make her fall?

01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:55.680
We found blood and fingerprints
on the torn sheet music.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.880
The National Forensic Lab is
processing it now.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.350
The results will come out soon.

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:03.980
You saw the blood on it, so you
picked it up.

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:09.620
Then absentmindedly, you
stuffed it into this book.

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.240
Just what was your reason?

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:15.500
I have no idea... what you're
talking about.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:18.460
Hye Mi wrote a letter to her
teacher.

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:36.050
<i>Teacher,</i>

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:42.029
<i>you believed in me until the end.
I'm really sorry for playing so badly.</i>

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.330
<i>Just like you said, I won't give up.
I'll get proper treatment, </i>

01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:50.359
<i>and after I become a great pianist,
I'll come back.</i>

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.200
<i>Teacher,</i>

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:57.460
<i>I sincerely respect and love you.</i>

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.689
-=I sincerely respect and love you.
Yours truly, Hye Mi.=-

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.540
Back then, my husband had been
scammed by someone.

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:29.069
Things were really difficult
because of a loan shark.

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:36.540
Because of that, I was on edge
all the time that they would
come to the school to collect.

01:09:36.979 --> 01:09:38.810
<i>Accept this.</i>

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:40.649
<i>I can't.</i>

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:43.950
<i>Just take it.</i>

01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:53.130
<i>Hello.</i>

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.000
<i>At first, I thought nothing would
happen.</i>

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.770
<i>But clearly someone made a
complaint.</i>

01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:06.710
<i>As teachers started leaving
one by one, </i>

01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:10.010
<i>I started to get more and
more angry.</i>

01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:12.210
<i>Hello.</i>

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.860
<i>Hello.</i>

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.320
<i>Who is it?</i>

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.990
<i>Stand up, whoever was laughing.</i>

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:05.060
<i>If you don't want lunch detention,
then settle...</i>

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:09.470
<i>With all the uneasiness I felt, I
thought Hye Mi was laughing at me.</i>

01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:16.080
<i>I thought all of her friends also
knew and would try to use me.</i>

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.480
<i>After that, I became more
and more upset.</i>

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:25.620
Every day I was so anxious,
until I just couldn't stand it.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.190
<i>I can't hold on.</i>

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.860
<i>Hye Mi!</i>

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.790
<i>Teacher, please help me. </i>

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:37.730
<i>I suddenly had the thought...</i>

01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:43.600
<i>What if nobody saw, and she
just fell?</i>

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.540
<i>Even now, I don't know why it
happened.</i>

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:50.940
I just turned around and left.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.150
<i>Save me!</i>

01:11:53.150 --> 01:11:59.390
<i>But as I turned around to leave,
I suddenly felt uneasy.</i>

01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:07.830
If she managed to live,
what would I do?

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:12.230
<i>I knew she would tell about me.</i>

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.900
<i>Then, somehow I...</i>

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.940
<i>Teacher! Teacher!</i>

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:29.680
A small misunderstanding grew
into something huge.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.350
Eventually, it became a tragedy.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:55.000
We solved the case, but why is
it so depressing?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.040
She's pitiful, just like me.

01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:04.910
You did good work, Han Na Yeong.

01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:08.580
What's going on?
You even said my name.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.450
This case was solved because
of you.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:18.120
Detective Jeong wanted me to
tell you.

01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:20.330
That was hard for you.

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:24.000
That's why you should treat
me better! Got it?

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:30.670
Seriously. She just comes
and goes whenever.

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:39.030
Ultimately, you had the same
wish as Hye Mi.

01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:46.020
We promised to play this when
we all got together again.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.950
Hye Mi was protecting our
promise.

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:51.160
I'm sorry, Hye Mi.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.090
I should have looked for
you sooner.

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:59.600
You should be leaving. You are
leaving to go abroad very soon.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.540
I've decided not to go.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:06.210
I want to stay here and start
all over.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:10.240
Please help me, Yu Ga Yeong.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.280
First let me see your ability.

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.810
Mr. Lawyer.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.650
What is this all about?

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:27.690
Someone is trying to kidnap me.

01:16:27.690 --> 01:16:31.360
The only lawyer I could think of
was you.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.930
For now, get in the car.

01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:51.180
What should I do?

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:55.950
If I tell the police, I'm sure
they won't believe me.

01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:24.580
Wh-What are you doing,
Mr. Lawyer?

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.050
Why? Why? Who are you?

01:17:26.050 --> 01:17:27.510
Let me go.

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:28.980
Let go! Who are you?

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.820
What's going on here?

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.020
Let me go!

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:37.420
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.990
He's caused some trouble.

01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:42.560
Fortunately, only this much.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:47.010
From now on, we'll have to be
more careful.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.660
-=Next Episode Preview=-

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.000
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:19.740
<i>This woman is Hwang Min Ju,
a 35-year-old journalist.</i>

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:22.290
<i>So, that definitely is Gim Mu
Hyeok, right?</i>

01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:24.780
<i>I have something to confirm
and request your assistance.</i>

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.710
<i>Don't look for me again.
If you do, you will really die. </i>

01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:29.170
<i>This face is a bit familiar.</i>

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:32.670
<i>Before Hwang Min Ju went up the
mountain, the last person she
called was Lee Jun Seok.</i>

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.580
<i>You should know, right?</i>

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.780
<i>You knew about everything!</i>

01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:38.350
<i>First we should find this woman.</i>

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:40.190
<i>I killed Reporter Hwang Min Ju.</i>

01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:40.920
<i>Stop him.</i>

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.020
<i>I said I did it! I killed her! </i>

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.590
<i>What's going on with you and
Gim Mu Hyeok?</i>
