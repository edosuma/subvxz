00:42.743 --> 00:44.945

today, Sunny.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.314

Did you get me
a new doggy ball?

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Throw the ball!
Throw the ball!

Today's the day
Rox is entering

- Great new moves, Rox.

01:10.671 --> 01:11.805
- Thanks, Blair.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.374
I figure if I want to win,

01:13.441 --> 01:15.643
I'll have to think big,
think bold--

01:15.709 --> 01:17.911
- Think you'd better
get your skateboard back

01:17.978 --> 01:19.813
if you want to
enter the competition.

Oh, Violet,
you're one funny bunny.

I even got a new helmet
for the competition.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.495
Red is my lucky color.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.929

when you're

01:35.996 --> 01:37.631
the best skateboarder
in town.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.832
You're sure to win.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.336
I've been practicing
really hard.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.373
But there's still one move
I haven't gotten:

01:45.439 --> 01:47.308
A loop-de-loop.
[sighs]

01:47.375 --> 01:49.443
It's my skating dream.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.212
- It's slow in the salon now.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.046
Why not go practice?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.982

Okay.

02:20.341 --> 02:23.544
- Well, I've practiced falling
over ten times this morning.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.415
So I should be perfect just in
time for the competition.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.716

Remember, it's not a race.

03:53.634 --> 03:57.638
I'll be awarding points
for style and flair.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.841
The trickier the move,
the more points you get.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.511
First up, we have Johnny-Ray.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.178

everything he knows.

One day, he'll be

He deserved to win.

from the best.

- Well, I'm thinking

08:50.731 --> 08:52.700
now that Junior's
the new town champion,

08:52.766 --> 08:55.268
I won't be needing
my skateboard anymore.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.370
I'm gonna find a new hobby.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.372
I like to be unique.

08:59.439 --> 09:02.309
- But you don't have to
give up skateboarding.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.113
[bell jingles]

09:06.179 --> 09:08.716
- [panting]

09:08.782 --> 09:10.851
- Junior?
What are you doing?

09:10.918 --> 09:12.219
- Shh!

09:12.285 --> 09:15.522
[indistinct chatter]

09:16.624 --> 09:17.524
- [sighs]

09:17.591 --> 09:19.860
I thought I'd never get away.

09:19.927 --> 09:23.063
- Shouldn't you be
at your own parade, Junior?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.598
- I ran away.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.668
Questions, questions,
"sign this," "say cheese."

09:27.735 --> 09:28.468
[sighs]

09:28.535 --> 09:29.703
I'm not sure I like

09:29.770 --> 09:31.705
being a champion
very much...

09:31.772 --> 09:34.608
especially when I'm not
a real champion.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.878
- You won that skating
competition fair and square.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.148
- I just fell and did a
loop-de-loop by accident.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.883
You should have won.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.184
- That's okay.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.954
I've decided to try
some new hobbies.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.125
- Ready to trim your tree, Rox?

09:52.192 --> 09:53.526
- Sure am.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.863
Now, this is the hobby for me.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.967
- Working with plants
is all about taking your time.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.002
You want to feel the tree,

10:02.069 --> 10:05.072
how it looks, how it smells...

10:05.138 --> 10:07.340
[scissors snipping]
[sniffs]

10:07.407 --> 10:09.276
Really get to know it.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.512
And most important of all,
don't over-trim.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.015
- Uh-oh.
- [gasps]

10:15.082 --> 10:16.650
- Next hobby.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.020
Ah.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.389
Flying kites is a great hobby.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.124
So peaceful.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.026
So relaxing.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.961
Whoa!

10:28.028 --> 10:29.229
Whoa-ho-ho!

10:29.296 --> 10:31.832
Whoa-oh-whoa!

10:31.899 --> 10:35.335
How do you turn this thing off?

10:35.402 --> 10:37.871
- Rox!
- Hang on.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.673
[all yelp, moan]

10:39.740 --> 10:43.043
- I don't think kite flying
is very me.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.980
- So what'd you think of the
new hobbies we tried?

10:47.047 --> 10:48.682
They were fun, right?

10:48.749 --> 10:49.883
- [sighs]

10:49.950 --> 10:52.485
None that were as fun
as skateboarding.

10:52.552 --> 10:53.954
It's okay, Sunny.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.655
I don't need a hobby.

10:55.723 --> 10:59.359
I'll just go and...
tidy something.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.360
- Uh...

11:00.427 --> 11:02.730
Rox tidying something?

11:02.796 --> 11:06.533
- We definitely need to get her
skateboarding again.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.038
- [panting]

11:11.104 --> 11:13.540
- I'm your biggest fan!
Can I get your autograph?

11:13.606 --> 11:16.209
- [panting]

11:16.276 --> 11:18.846
- Hey, where'd he go?

11:21.048 --> 11:23.083
- [screams]
- There's our champion.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.285
Have I got news for you.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.586
- Um...

11:26.653 --> 11:27.955
- Great news!

11:28.021 --> 11:30.123
No, the best news!

11:30.190 --> 11:32.292
As Friendly Falls
skateboarding champion,

11:32.359 --> 11:36.263
you get to represent our town
in the Battle of the Boards.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.198
Both: The Battle
of the Boards?

11:38.265 --> 11:40.533
- Wow, that is great news.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.670
Um, what is
the Battle of the Boards?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.773
- It's the biggest...
- The best...

11:45.839 --> 11:48.675
- The ultimate
skateboarding competition!

11:48.742 --> 11:51.678
- And you're sure
this is great news?

11:51.745 --> 11:56.283
- And what's more,
you'll be facing Skeeter.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.085
Both: Ooh!

11:58.151 --> 11:59.286
- Skeeter?

11:59.352 --> 12:00.520
Ooh, wow.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.522
Skeeter, you say.

12:02.589 --> 12:05.392
That sure is something.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.027
Who is Skeeter?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.561
- Skeeter?

12:08.628 --> 12:10.730
He's the Battle of the Boards'
reigning champion.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.633
- The best, most awesome
skateboarder ever!

12:13.700 --> 12:17.404
- And he'll be right here
in Friendly Falls tomorrow!

12:17.470 --> 12:18.505
- Tomorrow?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.240
- Friendly Falls has never won

12:20.307 --> 12:21.842
the Battle of the Boards.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.510
- Until now.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.012
Whoo-hoo!

12:25.078 --> 12:26.646
- [sighing]

12:26.713 --> 12:28.048
- Hi, Junior.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.649
I heard about
the Battle of the Boards.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.819
- It should be Rox competing.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.687
I'm only the champion
by accident.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.225
- You know, Junior,
you don't have to compete.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.860
- I don't?

12:39.927 --> 12:40.961
Great!

12:41.028 --> 12:42.329
- But...

12:42.395 --> 12:46.433
I think you might
regret it if you don't try.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.902
- But I'm not ready,
and I'm not Rox.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.371
I'll never be ready
to compete.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.840
- Never say never.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.109
You never know
till you give it a go.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.882
- Wha--whoa!

13:01.949 --> 13:03.283
Whoa!

13:03.350 --> 13:04.284
Whoa!

13:04.351 --> 13:06.286
[grunting]

13:06.353 --> 13:08.288
I'm okay!

13:08.355 --> 13:10.657
- Let's try some basics first.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.760
Skating around these
shampoo bottles

13:13.827 --> 13:15.595
will help with your balance.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.165
Okay, let's see what you got.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.804
[gasps]

13:25.705 --> 13:27.374
- [whimpers]
Whoa!

13:27.440 --> 13:29.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:29.476 --> 13:31.778
Whoa! Whoa!
[crash]

13:31.845 --> 13:34.848
- Sometimes you need to give it
a go more than once.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.549
Let me see your skateboard.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.518
I have an idea.

13:41.855 --> 13:42.923
Curlers,

13:42.990 --> 13:44.391
some sticky gel,

13:44.457 --> 13:46.193
and ribbon.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.395
Ta-da!

13:48.461 --> 13:49.897
This should do it.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.602
- [grunting]

13:58.005 --> 13:59.372
Thanks!

13:59.439 --> 14:02.242
Next time I'll try it
without the training wheels.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.911
Thanks for your help, Sunny.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.881
I may not be as good as Rox,
but I'll try my best.

14:09.216 --> 14:13.253
- Welcome, everyone,
to the Battle of the Boards!

14:13.320 --> 14:14.587
- Two, four, six, eight!

14:14.654 --> 14:17.958
Junior is the champion skate...

14:18.025 --> 14:18.858
Er.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.527
Skater.
[chuckles]

14:20.593 --> 14:22.195
It's a work in progress.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.731
[cheers and applause]

14:24.797 --> 14:26.599
- Thank you all for coming.

14:26.666 --> 14:30.904
Presenting the undefeated
reigning champion,

14:30.971 --> 14:32.572
Skeeter.

14:32.639 --> 14:36.143
[cheers and applause]

14:36.209 --> 14:37.477
- Wow.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.980
[cheers and applause]
- Whoo-hoo!

14:40.047 --> 14:41.614
- Whoa!
[cheers and applause]

14:41.681 --> 14:43.316
[board dragging]

14:43.383 --> 14:46.019
- Whoa! Shoo!
[laughs]

14:46.086 --> 14:49.689
- Whoo-hoo!
[cheers and applause]

14:49.756 --> 14:51.391
[cheers and applause]
- All right!

14:51.458 --> 14:52.759
- That was cool.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.761
- Thank you very much.

14:54.827 --> 14:58.565
- And introducing the
challenger, Junior!

14:58.631 --> 15:01.868
[cheers and applause]

15:03.870 --> 15:05.472
- You're my challenger?

15:05.538 --> 15:08.108
Well, good luck, little dude.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.444
- Whoo!

15:11.511 --> 15:13.313
- Ready.
Set.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.881
[air horn blares]

15:22.789 --> 15:26.026
[cheers and applause]

15:29.862 --> 15:34.567
[cheers and applause]

15:34.634 --> 15:36.636
crowd: Ooh!
- All right!

15:36.703 --> 15:38.138
- [sighs]

15:38.205 --> 15:39.306
- And this one.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.507
Whoa.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.975
Hey.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.277
[cheers and applause]

15:44.344 --> 15:45.345
Doop-de-doo.
Oh.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.479
[crowd gasps]

15:46.546 --> 15:48.048
- Wow! Okay, that was great.

15:48.115 --> 15:48.915
- Oh, yeah.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.850
[cheers and applause]

15:50.917 --> 15:52.919
- Whoa! A loop-de-loop!

15:52.986 --> 15:55.222
- And that was no accident.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.290
- Well done, Skeeter.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.059
A fan flip, handstand,

15:59.126 --> 16:01.361
walk the dog,
and a loop-de-loop?

16:01.428 --> 16:03.396
I'll just add those up.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.697
Whoa!

16:04.764 --> 16:06.866
A new Battle of the Boards
record!

16:06.933 --> 16:09.602
9 points out of 10!

16:09.669 --> 16:10.637
[cheers and applause]
- Whoa!

16:10.703 --> 16:11.738
- Skeeter!

16:11.804 --> 16:13.006
- Wow!

16:13.073 --> 16:14.674
- Thank you very much.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.544
I'll be signing autographs
if you'd like to form a line.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.546
- Whoa, Skeeter,
that was so great!

16:19.612 --> 16:23.150
- And now, Junior!
- [gasps]

16:23.216 --> 16:23.983
- [gasps]

16:24.051 --> 16:26.286
[cheers and applause]

16:29.556 --> 16:32.092
- [groans]

16:32.159 --> 16:33.526
- I know Junior,

16:33.593 --> 16:36.496
and that's his
really, really worried face.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.199
- Are you sure it's not his
really, really hungry face?

16:39.266 --> 16:41.068
Because that's exactly
like my face

16:41.134 --> 16:42.402
when my tummy's saying
I should eat

16:42.469 --> 16:43.770
some coconut cookies.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.040
- No, that's definitely
worried.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.642
Team Junior
needs a time-out.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.977
- Uh, sure, Rox.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.745
Time...
[air horn blares]

16:52.812 --> 16:54.013
- Out.
- [laughs]

16:54.081 --> 16:55.915
Sorry, Timmy.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.518
- Are you okay, Junior?

16:58.585 --> 17:01.254
- Okay?
I'm not ready.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.589
I can't do it.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.591
- You can do it.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.060
- Or you both do it.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.528
both: Both?

17:08.595 --> 17:10.397
- You're great skaters
on your own,

17:10.463 --> 17:13.600
but imagine how much better
you'd be skating together.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.402
- I'd love that!

17:15.468 --> 17:16.769
What do you say?

17:16.836 --> 17:18.238
- Let's do it.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.973
We'll be skating siblings.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.575
[laughs]

17:23.510 --> 17:24.677
- Skate together?

17:24.744 --> 17:26.713
I better check the rule book.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.281
Let's see now.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.783
Elbow pad rules, helmet rules,

17:30.850 --> 17:32.785
kneepad rules,
skate shoe rules...

17:32.852 --> 17:35.622
- Looks like this might
take some time.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.124
- [gasps]

17:37.190 --> 17:40.993
And while we wait,
how 'bout some skater style?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.162
- Yeah!

17:42.229 --> 17:43.263
[device beeps]

17:50.770 --> 17:52.672
- Doodle, comb?

17:53.673 --> 17:54.907
- Comb.

17:54.974 --> 17:57.810
- Ooh, Sunny,
I can't wait to see.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.012
- Hair elastic?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.114
- Hair elastic.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.254
- Hair clips.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.488
- I can't find them.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.657
- [indistinct chatter]

18:10.723 --> 18:12.192
- It's okay, Doodle.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.660
I think I found them.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.595
- [indistinct chatter]

18:15.662 --> 18:17.664
- Thanks, Violet.
- [indistinct chatter]

18:17.730 --> 18:19.832
- Don't forget my helmet.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.302
- Good thing I brought it.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.904
- Hurry, Sunny.
Timmy's almost done.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.343
- Finishing touch.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.644
[laughs]

18:31.711 --> 18:33.346
And there it is.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.347
- Wow.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.348
Thanks, Sunny.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.250
I love my skater style.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.452
[cheers and laughter]
- Cool!

18:39.519 --> 18:40.687
- [laughs]

18:40.753 --> 18:42.088
Swishy.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.457
- I haven't forgotten you,
Junior.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.058
[marker squeaking]

18:46.125 --> 18:47.860
[laughs]

18:47.927 --> 18:49.862
There you go.
- Awesome.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.632
- Now you two are ready
to skate together.

18:52.699 --> 18:53.866
Smile!

18:53.933 --> 18:54.867
Both: Thanks, Sunny.

[camera shutter clicks]

18:56.203 --> 18:58.538
- That's one
for the Style Files.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.740
- [moans, gasps]
- As I thought.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.074
There's nothing in the rules

19:02.141 --> 19:03.910
to say we can't
have a skating duo.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.077
[cheers and applause]

19:05.144 --> 19:07.046
- Aww, yeah.
- Bring it on!

19:07.113 --> 19:10.217
- Oh, as long as it's okay
with Skeeter.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.884
- Sure it is.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.787
My big sister skated with me
in my first competition too.

19:14.854 --> 19:15.888
- Awesome!

19:15.955 --> 19:18.658
[upbeat music]

19:18.725 --> 19:19.659
- Stop.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.494
Something's missing.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.562
- Your skateboard!

19:22.629 --> 19:24.531
It's back at the salon!

19:25.332 --> 19:27.500
- Well, here.
You can use mine.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.869
- Thanks, Skeeter.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.138
I'll take good care of it.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.139
- Ready.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.307
Set.

[cheers and applause]

19:43.450 --> 19:44.917
- [laughs]

19:44.984 --> 19:46.586
You can do it, Junior!

19:46.653 --> 19:48.588
Remember, we're a team!

19:48.655 --> 19:50.723
Hold my hand.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.659
Crowd: Ooh!

19:52.725 --> 19:55.328

20:04.671 --> 20:07.440
Whoa!

20:07.507 --> 20:08.441
We're flying!

20:08.508 --> 20:10.743
Crowd: Ooh!

20:10.810 --> 20:12.779
- How about we try that
loop-de-loop?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.781
- But you've never done it
before.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.549
- But you have.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.617
- [laughs]

20:17.684 --> 20:18.885
Aww, yeah.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.354

[can clatters]

20:33.165 --> 20:34.901
- [gasps]
Did we do it?

20:34.967 --> 20:36.569
Did we do a loop-de-loop?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.104
- No.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.071
- Aww.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.174
- We did a double loop-de-loop!

20:42.241 --> 20:43.009
- Yes!

20:43.075 --> 20:44.977
[cheers and applause]

20:45.044 --> 20:47.347
- Wow!
A double loop-de-loop!

20:47.414 --> 20:48.781
- Let's see.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.384
Skeeter scored
an amazing 9 points,

20:51.451 --> 20:55.555
which is the highest score ever
in the Battle of the Boards!

20:55.622 --> 20:59.091
[cheers and applause]

20:59.158 --> 21:00.192
- [sighs]

21:00.259 --> 21:02.161
- Until now!

21:02.228 --> 21:05.832
Because Rox and Junior,
with that double loop-de-loop,

21:05.898 --> 21:09.469
win with 10 out of 10!

21:09.536 --> 21:10.803
[air horn squawks]

21:10.870 --> 21:11.904

- They did it!

21:11.971 --> 21:14.006
Wahoo, you did it!

21:14.073 --> 21:15.808
- All right, Junior!
Whoo-hoo!

21:15.875 --> 21:19.211
- This is even more exciting
than having a new doggy ball.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.014
- You gotta show me
how to pull off that move.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.683
If you don't mind sharing.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.084
- We'd be happy to.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.520
Skating's a lot more fun
when you skate together.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.621
Right, Junior?

21:28.688 --> 21:30.289
- Right.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.491
- Congratulations

21:31.558 --> 21:34.594
to our very own
skating siblings...

Rox and Junior!

- Hi!
It's me, Sunny,

21:43.135 --> 21:45.505
with another look
inside the Style Files.

21:45.572 --> 21:49.976
Wow, your hair looks like
Rox's rainbow helmet.

21:50.042 --> 21:56.549
For this hairstyle and more,
check out the Nick Jr. app.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.685
