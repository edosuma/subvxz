WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:04.880
From the second we awaken from
a night's slumber, we depend on--

00:04.890 --> 00:08.620
no,take for granted-- all
sorts of invisible,silent,

00:08.630 --> 00:12.350
and violent systems that make
our modern lives possible.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.100
Take that alarm clock.

00:16.110 --> 00:19.700
Before it can do its job and
wake me up, it has to have power.

00:22.070 --> 00:27.320
Water,coal and wind power are harnessed
by turbines and turned into...electricity,

00:27.330 --> 00:33.190
which is then sent through cables that
are over our heads and under our feet.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.020
So it's easy to forget that at
any given time we are surrounded

00:36.030 --> 00:42.190
by thousands or millions or billions of
volts of electricity coursing all around us.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.920
Joe? Girls? Come on! Today's a big day.

00:48.910 --> 00:53.120
Even something as simple as frying an
egg begins thousands of feet underground

00:53.130 --> 00:58.750
erthe se ofrehistoric plants and
animals are pulverized into gas...

00:59.950 --> 01:03.540
then sucked out of the
ground and processed,

01:04.110 --> 01:08.680
and then piped all across the country
through over one million miles of pipes,

01:08.700 --> 01:12.960
all of it there to heat us and
make having a hot breakfast easier.

01:15.550 --> 01:18.060
Come on,girls. Hurry
up! We're gonna be late.

01:18.070 --> 01:21.850
And then there's that
modern miracle we call a car.

01:21.860 --> 01:24.560
Built around the internal
combustion engine,

01:24.620 --> 01:30.160
the average American car holds anywhere
from 12 to 16 gallons of gasoline.

01:30.170 --> 01:36.130
That's somewhere between 100 and 150
pounds of instantly combustible liquid.

01:36.450 --> 01:40.890
It also contains a battery and at
least six to eight quarts of oil.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.500
If you stop and think about it,
taken as the sum of itsparts,

01:44.520 --> 01:46.910
it's really a rolling bomb,

01:46.920 --> 01:52.250
equipped with stereophonic
sound and adjustable seats.

01:52.260 --> 01:54.240
But we don't do that.

01:54.270 --> 01:56.930
We don't think of it in pieces.
We think of it as a whole.

01:56.940 --> 02:00.490
It's a car. Our car.

02:00.790 --> 02:02.570
And we love it.

Car Trouble</font>

02:55.550 --> 02:57.280
- Hey,Ariel?
- Yeah?

02:57.290 --> 03:00.830
Did you ever notice that on the
cereal box, there's a picture of a kid,

03:00.840 --> 03:05.480
sitting at a table eating cereal,
and on that table is a cereal box,

03:05.490 --> 03:08.490
and on that cereal box
is a picture of a kid,

03:08.500 --> 03:10.620
sitting at a table eating cereal,

03:10.630 --> 03:14.620
and on that table is another
cereal box, and on that box...

03:14.630 --> 03:17.560
- Dad,you have to make her stop.
- Bridge,stop.

03:17.570 --> 03:19.470
What? I'm just trying to find out.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.290
Do you think they go on forever?

03:21.300 --> 03:26.320
Do you think the cereal boxes just keep
going and getting smaller and smaller

03:26.330 --> 03:29.700
till there's one just
the size of a molecule?

03:29.710 --> 03:34.500
You know,when you go under water in the
bathtub, you're staying down there too long.

03:34.510 --> 03:35.170
Ariel...

03:35.190 --> 03:36.960
Why? Because you don't know the answer?

03:36.970 --> 03:38.330
Do you girls know where your mother is?

03:38.340 --> 03:41.320
I know the answer. I'm
just not wasting it on you.

03:42.040 --> 03:45.560
Honey,do you know where your mommy is?

03:47.850 --> 03:49.850
Allison?

04:06.460 --> 04:08.840
What are you doing out here?

04:10.530 --> 04:11.810
Sorry.

04:11.820 --> 04:14.360
Uh,what are you doing out here?

04:14.370 --> 04:17.459
You're not going to believe
this, but I had a crazy dream.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.510
You don't say.

04:20.670 --> 04:23.470
I-I was taking the kids to school,
and they climbed in the car,

04:23.480 --> 04:27.520
and I turned the key, and it blew up.

04:27.530 --> 04:29.660
What do you mean,blew up?

04:32.020 --> 04:34.430
Okay,Allison, that's crazy.
I mean,cars-- they-they...

04:34.440 --> 04:35.500
Cars don't just blow up.

04:35.510 --> 04:38.340
Not unless somebody puts
a bomb underneath them.

04:38.350 --> 04:40.950
Or forgets to put in oil in,
and the engine catches on fire.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.890
I mean,cars don't just blow up.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.430
Yeah,I know that. I do.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.230
That's why I came out here. I just...

04:47.240 --> 04:52.060
I figured, I'll just sit in the
car. I'll turn the key and prove it.

04:52.070 --> 04:52.900
Okay.

04:52.910 --> 04:54.160
The thing is, I just... I can't do it.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.930
I've been sitting out here
for 15 minutes. I just can't.

04:56.940 --> 05:00.190
I can't get my hand to turn the key.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.190
Okay,Allison, get out of the car.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.540
Why? What are you going to do?

05:03.550 --> 05:05.030
I'm going to slide in and turn the key.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.940
You can't do that.

05:06.950 --> 05:08.810
You could kill our kids.

05:08.820 --> 05:12.260
You could kill yourself,
kill me,destroy our house.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.790
Allison...

05:13.800 --> 05:15.910
I dreamt it.

05:22.340 --> 05:23.770
What are you doing?

05:24.360 --> 05:25.370
Where-Where are you going?

05:25.380 --> 05:26.870
I'm gonna round up our kids.

05:26.880 --> 05:31.300
I'm gonna go stand on the corner with
them while you try to start the car.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.310
Well,hold on a second.

05:40.190 --> 05:41.770
Mom,I don't understand.

05:41.780 --> 05:44.040
Why are we standing on the
corner staring at our own house?

05:44.050 --> 05:46.610
It's kind of hard to explain.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.960
It's stupid.

05:52.180 --> 05:54.770
Never mind!

05:54.780 --> 05:56.940
Don't do it!

05:59.430 --> 06:02.130
Joe!

06:02.490 --> 06:05.450
Answer me!

06:06.700 --> 06:07.270
Dad?

06:07.280 --> 06:12.010
Joe,don't turn that key! Joe!

06:12.370 --> 06:14.710
Do not turn that key!

06:15.060 --> 06:17.350
You guys calling me?

06:18.370 --> 06:19.840
Thank God you didn't do it.

06:19.860 --> 06:21.650
Do what, sweetie?

06:21.660 --> 06:23.620
Sweetie,hey,hey, hey,it's okay.

06:23.630 --> 06:26.120
I've just been trying to turn the
car on for the last five minutes.

06:26.130 --> 06:26.960
It's dead. It won't do anything.

06:26.970 --> 06:31.210
It won't start,won't click,won't
turn over. Nothing. It's dead.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.970
Don't worry.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.120
Okay,thanks. Gracias.

06:41.940 --> 06:43.950
Well,that was fun.

06:43.960 --> 06:47.330
All of us in the car
together,going to school.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.530
Dropping off the girls.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.540
So,if you're going to take
the car to go meet Scanlon,

06:51.550 --> 06:53.380
how am I going to get home tonight?

06:53.390 --> 06:54.590
Well,just call me when you're ready.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.500
I'll ask Ariel to watch the
girls, and I'll come and get you.

06:57.510 --> 06:59.830
Okay,I suppose that works.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.680
Um,all right,so I guess I'll call
you once I hear from the mechanic.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.560
I'll fill you in.

07:06.090 --> 07:08.860
Hey,this is great! I'm early.

07:08.870 --> 07:11.440
I just realized, I don't have to
drop you off. I can come in with you.

07:11.450 --> 07:14.610
I can see your new
office, see where you work.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.460
You sure you want to do that?

07:16.470 --> 07:20.290
That's an awful lot of excitement
for this early hour in the morning.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.380
This is nice.

07:27.390 --> 07:29.660
Oh,yes,we have it all.

07:29.670 --> 07:31.930
Floors,ceiling,window.

07:31.940 --> 07:34.210
Which one's yours?

07:37.700 --> 07:39.950
Hey,I got a good feeling.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.840
Oh,that's static electricity. That's
your feet dragging on the carpet.

07:44.190 --> 07:48.150
Hey,where you going?
Allison? What are you doing?

07:48.680 --> 07:51.180
Hey,Allison?

07:51.950 --> 07:55.300
She's got a picture of her
boyfriend on her desk! We like that.

07:55.310 --> 07:58.310
Hey,don't do that. Don't go in there.

07:58.320 --> 08:01.290
She's pretty! You never told
me that she was so pretty.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.160
Allison,I beg of you,
get out of her office!

08:04.170 --> 08:06.130
She's going to walk through
that front door any second.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.500
If you're going to be a
successful entrepreneur,

08:08.520 --> 08:11.690
- you better learn to calm down.
- Come on!

08:13.470 --> 08:15.290
Thank you.

08:15.860 --> 08:19.440
What's the big deal? Everybody does it.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.850
Mrs. Dubois?

08:22.860 --> 08:24.460
Allison.

08:24.470 --> 08:25.960
Meghan Doyle.

08:25.980 --> 08:27.550
So nice to finally meet you.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.960
Yeah,it's nice to finally meet you.

08:29.970 --> 08:33.870
I recognized you from the
pictures on Joe's desk.

08:37.490 --> 08:39.960
So this is nice. Special occasion?

08:39.970 --> 08:43.960
Uh,no. We just,you
know, decided to carpool.

08:43.970 --> 08:47.060
Um,actually, I need to get going.

08:47.070 --> 08:48.590
I'll walk you to the car.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.630
We should get together
for dinner one night.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.580
That-That would be fun. It
was nice finally meeting you.

08:53.590 --> 08:56.130
Nice meeting you,Allison.

08:58.150 --> 09:00.420
Well,she's very pretty.

09:00.430 --> 09:03.060
Well let's try not to
hold that against her.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.980
So,wait a second. You're saying that the
entire electrical system needs to be replaced?

09:07.340 --> 09:09.640
Well,how much is that going to cost?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.220
You're kidding me.

09:11.230 --> 09:14.140
I don't think the car cost
that when we bought it.

09:14.150 --> 09:17.710
No,don't start work on the car,
not until you hear back from me.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.730
Oh,yeah?

09:23.240 --> 09:25.800
Well,that's serendipitous.

09:26.510 --> 09:29.370
Sorry,Ricky. I'm going
to have to call you back.

09:29.380 --> 09:32.490
Um,but I'm very interested.

09:32.510 --> 09:35.770
Okay,I will. I will call. Bye.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.200
Sorry. Car place.

09:40.210 --> 09:43.770
My wife's car is,like,
dead to the world.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.750
Sorry. That's not why
you came to see me.

09:48.760 --> 09:52.680
The company that's doing our
patent search just called me.

09:52.690 --> 09:55.370
We're completely clear
everywhere in North America.

09:55.380 --> 09:58.300
South America looks fine,Asia.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.330
But he's worried that there
may be a patent filed in

10:01.350 --> 10:04.880
what they used to refer to as
one of the Eastern Bloc countries.

10:04.900 --> 10:08.590
He wouldn't be specific with me,but
they have free market economies now.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.490
They're trading partners,competitors.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.200
So,if somebody already
beat us to the punch,

10:15.210 --> 10:18.230
in let's say the Czech Republic...

10:18.240 --> 10:19.330
So wait a second. What are you saying?

10:19.340 --> 10:24.210
Are you saying that they think that somebody
in Eastern Europe already came up with my idea?

10:25.320 --> 10:27.990
What does that mean?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.030
It means...

10:30.040 --> 10:33.350
it's a good thing all
this furniture is rented.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.280
It means we wait.

10:35.290 --> 10:36.920
I don't know what it means.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.970
I'm hoping it that
doesn't mean anything.

10:38.990 --> 10:43.640
I'm hoping,in a day or two, once they've
finished their research, it means nothing.

10:43.650 --> 10:46.120
That's what I'm hoping.

10:50.580 --> 10:54.070
Don't panic. I'm a friendly burglar.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.260
I'm even bringing in the mail.

10:56.270 --> 10:57.370
Hey,what are you doing home?

10:57.380 --> 10:59.990
I thought you were going
to call me for a ride.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.170
Did they fix my car yet?

11:02.180 --> 11:04.020
Uh,no,they didn't.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.360
Okay,so how'd you get home?

11:05.370 --> 11:07.660
And why do you have that
funny look on your face?

11:07.670 --> 11:11.660
- Ah,well,therein lies a tale.
- Really.

11:11.670 --> 11:15.380
Yes.And though it begins quite sadly,

11:15.390 --> 11:18.350
'tis a tale with a
happy ending, methinks.

11:18.360 --> 11:21.470
Mom, why is Dad talking funny?

11:21.480 --> 11:22.730
I don't know.

11:22.760 --> 11:27.290
Um,your car, I'm afraid,has
shuffled off this mortal coil.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.080
What does that mean? They can't fix it?

11:29.090 --> 11:34.630
Uh,well, anything can be fixed, but it would
cost more than it's actually worth to do it.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.280
Well,Joe,I love that car.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.360
I know you do,babe.

11:37.370 --> 11:39.110
Honey,that's the first
car we bought together.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.710
We brought our daughters home
from the hospital in that car.

11:41.740 --> 11:42.510
I know.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.470
But remember how I said that
this story had a happy ending?

11:45.480 --> 11:48.060
Okay,so the mechanic,
who was fixing our car,

11:48.090 --> 11:52.960
he called me,and he told me that he'd
just put new tires on a pristine SUV

11:52.970 --> 11:54.810
that the owner was
looking to get rid of.

11:54.820 --> 11:57.040
- For a steal.
- For a steal?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.020
Yeah. I mean,this thing,this,
I mean this car is...

11:59.030 --> 12:00.850
is big. It's clean. It's roomy.

12:00.860 --> 12:03.080
It's got all kinds of things
that your car never had.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.860
Navigation. CD player. Cup holders.

12:05.870 --> 12:09.160
Cup holders? I do love cup holders.

12:09.170 --> 12:12.100
I don't know. A used car.

12:12.110 --> 12:14.680
Well,I know, honey, but the truth
is we can't afford a new one.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.220
And this car really isn't that used.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.880
Yeah,okay,but,you know, it
belonged to somebody else.

12:19.890 --> 12:21.900
It had a past life with somebody else.

12:21.910 --> 12:25.010
But I'm telling you, this car looks like
it just came right off the showroom floor.

12:25.020 --> 12:26.080
So,you've seen it?

12:26.100 --> 12:28.440
Actually,I drove it.

12:28.470 --> 12:31.250
Actually,I bought it.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.390
I know it was wrong
to buy it without you.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.120
Just it seemed too good to be true.

12:37.460 --> 12:40.190
- It's pretty in here.
- My car seat's already in here!

12:40.200 --> 12:44.020
Is this car that I'm going
to drive when I turn 16?

12:47.030 --> 12:49.560
Our mechanic called and told me what
time the guy was going to get there--

12:49.570 --> 12:52.210
the guy who owned it to pick it
up-- and so I just went over there.

12:52.220 --> 12:54.140
I was just having one of those
days where everything went wrong

12:54.150 --> 12:56.740
and then I saw this car
and it just seemed so right.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.290
It's kind of a big
change being this high.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.300
Now,look, if you don't like this, you
can take my car and I'll take this.

13:03.610 --> 13:07.200
Come on,girls. Hop in! We're going
to take this baby for a test drive.

13:07.210 --> 13:08.500
I call the front!

13:08.510 --> 13:11.050
- I call the back!
- I call the back,too.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.930
Seat belts!

13:12.940 --> 13:15.210
- Seat belt.
- Buckle up.

13:18.740 --> 13:21.880
Sounds nice!

13:21.890 --> 13:23.330
Hey,can you check the spaghetti?

13:23.340 --> 13:25.310
No problem.

13:26.130 --> 13:28.360
Now don't go too far.

13:28.370 --> 13:30.980
Remember, none of you have passports.

13:30.990 --> 13:34.750
Say good-bye to Daddy,girls.
We may never see him again.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.220
Bye,Dad!

13:40.800 --> 13:42.330
So I guess now we wait.

13:42.340 --> 13:44.490
What exactly are we waiting for?

13:44.500 --> 13:49.320
Uh,for the patent folks to check the records
of all those Eastern European countries.

13:49.690 --> 13:51.000
And that'll take?

13:51.010 --> 13:53.810
Oh,I don't know. A day or two.

13:53.820 --> 13:58.170
We should know something, uh,tomorrow
night. Or the night after that.

13:58.180 --> 14:00.930
The time difference doesn't help.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.030
All right,so I'm going to
ask the obvious question.

14:04.040 --> 14:08.750
You know,if everything could go away
tomorrow, should we really be buying a car?

14:09.290 --> 14:12.480
I don't know. Probably isn't very smart.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.090
Just felt great.

14:17.460 --> 14:20.440
I can't explain it.
It's just been so hard.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.940
Not being able to buy anything.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.330
And not being able to do
anything for my family.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.120
I love that car.

14:34.130 --> 14:36.720
It's a beautiful car.

14:36.730 --> 14:39.550
I was actually thinking I'd
like to go sit in it some more.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.610
- You want to?
- No.

16:28.940 --> 16:30.130
I'm telling you,Joe.

16:30.140 --> 16:32.740
Someone was shot in that car! A woman.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.870
She was sitting in the
seat right next to me.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.550
Well,I'm sorry,honey, but I
don't think that's possible.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.950
I mean,what I mean to say is
I-I did a records check on it.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.240
One of those online
things and nothing came up.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.730
Of course nothing came up!

16:44.740 --> 16:48.390
Those things are supposed to tell you
if a car's in a collision or an accident.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.820
Not something like this.

16:49.830 --> 16:51.860
No wonder this car was such a bargain.

16:51.870 --> 16:54.370
Well,hold on a second.
Wait,wait,wait, wait,wait,wait.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.480
Look... be fair here.

16:56.490 --> 16:59.090
There's nothing wrong
with the car itself.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.430
It had no way of knowing it was
going to end up being driven by you.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.320
Excuse me.

17:02.330 --> 17:04.170
All right,okay. Hold on a
second. That came out wrong.

17:04.180 --> 17:06.619
- What I'm trying to say...
- No,I know what you're trying to say.

17:06.630 --> 17:10.460
But I'm not the problem
here. This car is haunted.

17:10.470 --> 17:15.560
And I cannot, I will not drive it again,
much less ask my children to sit in it.

17:15.569 --> 17:18.030
All right. All right.
Fine. Okay. I hear you.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.720
First thing in the morning, I'll drive
it back to the guy that I bought it from.

17:20.730 --> 17:23.800
I'll see if I can convince
him to give me my money back.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.740
Thank you.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.550
In the meantime, you
drive the kids in my car.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.160
Thank you.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.490
Hello. Well,what do you know?

17:43.500 --> 17:46.630
If it isn't the fella who
robbed me blind yesterday.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.810
I'm sorry to drop in like this.

17:47.830 --> 17:49.800
Oh,it's okay. In fact,
I was going to call you.

17:49.810 --> 17:51.100
Forgot to give you a couple of things.

17:51.110 --> 17:53.630
Cigarette lighter, extra key,
little jar of touch-up paint.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.100
I appreciate that.

17:55.110 --> 17:57.890
The thing is,um, I got a problem.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.870
Okay. What kind of problem?

17:59.880 --> 18:01.930
Well,it's my wife,um...

18:01.940 --> 18:04.340
She's not crazy about the car.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.980
Really?

18:06.660 --> 18:09.300
Do you think maybe she just
needs some time to get used to it?

18:09.310 --> 18:11.750
If only it were that simple.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.600
Well,I'm sorry, but I
don't know what to tell you.

18:15.610 --> 18:18.490
Well,I was hoping you'd tell
me that you hadn't sent the,uh,

18:18.500 --> 18:20.820
notice of sale in to the DMV yet.

18:20.830 --> 18:22.370
Well,I have.

18:22.380 --> 18:25.180
But it wouldn't have made
any difference if I hadn't.

18:25.190 --> 18:27.640
If you'll excuse me, I have to
go in now. Get ready for work.

18:27.650 --> 18:31.480
Uh,well,the thing is,uh, I don't know if
it's the same with cars,but with houses,

18:31.490 --> 18:34.470
when you sell 'em, you're obligated
to disclose certain things.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.560
Like if there's been a... a
recent death on the premises.

18:38.570 --> 18:41.040
Okay. So what'd you do?

18:41.050 --> 18:42.640
You Google me or something?

18:42.650 --> 18:45.930
You figure now that you know, you can come
back here, maybe I'll cut the price even more?

18:45.940 --> 18:47.520
I'm not looking for a bargain.

18:47.530 --> 18:50.110
I just want to give you the
car back. Get my money back.

18:50.120 --> 18:53.300
Pretend the whole thing never
happened. I'm sorry if I upset you.

18:53.310 --> 18:55.640
Do you know what happened?

18:55.650 --> 18:58.530
My wife,uh, did the research. I just...

18:58.540 --> 19:02.150
My wife was killed in that car. Shot.

19:02.770 --> 19:05.520
While I watched.

19:06.380 --> 19:08.520
It was a carjacking.

19:08.530 --> 19:11.220
Not three miles from here.

19:11.230 --> 19:13.900
Coming back from a
movie. Stopped at a light.

19:13.910 --> 19:16.620
This guy comes out
of nowhere with a gun.

19:16.630 --> 19:19.430
Told us to get out of the car.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.590
I can remember my hand reaching for
the door when I heard her say it.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.310
"Floor it,Tim. Floor it."

19:29.120 --> 19:32.490
Stupid me. I listened to her.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.760
I can't really blame him for
not wanting to take it back.

19:35.770 --> 19:37.780
I know. I feel terrible for him.

19:37.790 --> 19:39.130
So what are we going to do?

19:39.140 --> 19:41.030
Well,I don't know.All I
can think to do is sell it.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.750
- Oh,make it someone else's problem.
- Allison.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.040
Well,it doesn't seem right.

19:45.050 --> 19:47.340
Yeah,it's actually a great car.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.630
If you say so.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.600
Well,I do say so.

19:49.610 --> 19:54.040
And besides we can't afford to buy
another car until we get rid of this one.

19:54.050 --> 19:57.450
With any luck whoever buys it is going
to be as blissfully unintuitive as I am.

19:57.460 --> 19:58.800
That's not funny.

19:58.810 --> 19:59.580
It's not meant to be funny.

19:59.590 --> 20:02.710
Allison,look, if you hadn't told me
about Rory Carmer's ghost riding shotgun,

20:02.720 --> 20:06.280
I'd be driving it around right now thinking
it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.810
Oh,right. So now it's my fault?

20:07.820 --> 20:09.200
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying...

20:09.210 --> 20:11.980
Look,you,you know what I'm saying.

20:11.990 --> 20:13.840
I know. We have to sell it.

20:13.850 --> 20:17.960
Um,yes. Hold on,hold
on, sweetie,hold on.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.600
Yeah,well,we will. We
will. As soon as we can.

20:21.610 --> 20:23.360
Well,what does that mean?

20:23.370 --> 20:24.940
Well,that's the other thing I found out.

20:24.950 --> 20:27.420
Looks like we're going to be stuck
with it. For at least a couple of weeks.

20:27.430 --> 20:28.360
Why?

20:28.370 --> 20:30.340
Well,because we can't legally
sell it until we have the title.

20:30.360 --> 20:34.450
And I called the DMV and,uh, they're still
like two weeks away from mailing it to us.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.840
This is a fantastic phone call.

20:36.850 --> 20:39.170
Oh,yeah,we aim to please.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.960
Look,Allison,you'll just have to drive my
car and I'll drive the hearse, all right?

20:41.970 --> 20:43.300
It's not the end of the world.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.740
I just,I miss my old car.

20:45.770 --> 20:47.580
Well,that's a productive point of view.

20:47.590 --> 20:50.620
- Look,I-I should really
get to work. - Okay.

20:50.630 --> 20:53.460
- All right, I'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.180
- More car trouble,huh?
- Yeah.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.580
I heard you guys going at it.

21:03.590 --> 21:06.120
Oh,no,no,no,no. We weren't...

21:06.130 --> 21:08.320
She's not terribly happy
with the car that I bought.

21:08.330 --> 21:10.790
And the truth is I shouldn't
have bought it without her.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.140
Ah,but this too will pass.

21:12.150 --> 21:14.910
Um,it's not like we
had a fight or anything.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.720
Okay. If you say so.

21:17.730 --> 21:18.960
What?

21:18.970 --> 21:22.860
You don't get to be my age and still
single and not know what a fight is.

21:22.870 --> 21:26.020
But you're right. It will pass.

21:26.030 --> 21:31.010
Had one myself last night and I'm
expecting the make-up phone call any minute.

21:31.020 --> 21:33.490
Looking forward to it,in fact.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.350
So,how are the drawings coming?

21:40.360 --> 21:41.990
They're coming.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.380
Uh,is there any news
on our patent search?

21:43.390 --> 21:46.880
'Cause I gotta tell you, I really
didn't sleep very well last night.

21:50.470 --> 21:53.020
- All right,the drawings.
- Drawings.

21:57.830 --> 22:02.180
It's all here. 911
calls,forensics report,everything.

22:02.910 --> 22:05.360
You mind telling me what
you want all this for?

22:05.370 --> 22:08.390
I don't know. I started thinking maybe
this whole car thing happened for a reason.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.780
Maybe I'm supposed to help
find this woman's killer,

22:10.790 --> 22:14.610
bring him to justice so he can
never do this to anyone ever again.

22:14.620 --> 22:19.120
Well,good luck. A lot of good
detectives already spent months on this.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.860
I'll be at my desk if you need me.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.250
Oh,my God,she's...
she's-she's not breathing.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.660
I don't think she's breathing!

22:26.670 --> 22:28.360
Sir,what is your location?

22:28.380 --> 22:31.990
Uh,we're,like,three blocks south of
the Fantasy Theatre on-on that big road

22:32.000 --> 22:34.030
that runs parallel to the freeway.

22:37.020 --> 22:40.830
Okay,the man with the gun-- did you see
which direction he came from,Mr. Carmer?

22:40.840 --> 22:42.700
Um,no.

22:42.710 --> 22:45.530
Uh,I was adjusting the radio,
looking... looking for a station.

22:45.540 --> 22:48.050
My wife loved classical music...

22:48.060 --> 22:50.360
We pulled up to the light,
and-and there he was.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.400
Was he white? Black? Latino?

22:52.410 --> 22:53.870
Uh,it was dark.

22:53.880 --> 22:57.420
And-And I-I don't want to
get this wrong. I mean...

22:57.430 --> 23:02.060
he could have been white,
but I-I think he was Latino.

23:05.970 --> 23:08.110
Sorry to interrupt.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.650
One of the other
detectives needs the room.

23:09.660 --> 23:12.930
I'm gonna have to ask you to clear out.

23:12.940 --> 23:17.220
I think I saw him,Lee.*******

23:18.260 --> 23:21.220
Hey,Al,it's... I'm
sorry. Did I wake you?

23:21.760 --> 23:23.890
Hey,listen,sweetie,
how-how crazy is this?

23:23.910 --> 23:29.380
Uh,it's-it's 10:00 at night, and I just now
realized that I don't have my wallet in my pocket.

23:29.970 --> 23:32.910
Um,where are you? In the living room.

23:32.920 --> 23:37.300
Hey,do me a favor-- just go by... go in the
kitchen and see if it's... if it's by the phone.

23:38.670 --> 23:41.330
Yeah. Yeah,I can hold on...

23:42.000 --> 23:44.810
Okay. Oh,good, good,good,okay.

23:44.820 --> 23:47.030
No,no,no,no,no. I don't
need you to bring it to me.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.690
I just need to know that it's there.

23:50.010 --> 23:54.090
Yeah. Uh,it-it may be a while
still,sweetie. I'm sorry.

23:54.410 --> 23:56.530
Miss you.

23:57.670 --> 24:00.890
I thought you were with the boyfriend.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.080
Best-laid plans...

24:03.090 --> 24:06.440
Or not laid,as the case may be.

24:06.940 --> 24:11.830
No,actually,I got a call
in the middle of dinner.

24:11.840 --> 24:17.090
It turns out there's no
one in the whole wide world

24:17.100 --> 24:20.480
as inventive as Joe Dubois.

24:20.490 --> 24:23.340
What are you saying? Are you saying
the patent people finally called?

24:23.350 --> 24:26.300
Are you saying the idea's
in the free and clear?

24:26.320 --> 24:30.720
I'm saying... that we're
in business,partner.

24:30.730 --> 24:36.400
We have a prototype to
build, a future to forge.

24:37.030 --> 24:39.570
That is great news.

24:39.580 --> 24:44.760
Now you probably want to get
back to your boyfriend, celebrate.

24:44.770 --> 24:46.860
No.

24:46.870 --> 24:50.480
Is that the best idea you have?

24:50.490 --> 24:54.810
I mean,that doesn't
sound very inventive.

24:55.300 --> 25:00.720
That doesn't sound like
much of a celebration.

25:17.850 --> 25:18.590
Hello.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.670
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

25:19.680 --> 25:21.560
No,you didn't wake me.

25:21.570 --> 25:24.050
I just now realized that
I don't have my wallet.

25:24.070 --> 25:26.510
Your wallet?

25:27.710 --> 25:30.430
Yeah. Hold on.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.600
Allison.

25:34.620 --> 25:35.940
What-What are you doing here?

25:35.950 --> 25:37.920
I told you you didn't have
to come all the way down here.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.220
No. I know. I wanted to.

25:40.230 --> 25:43.130
Couldn't sleep. Thought
I'd take a drive.

25:43.140 --> 25:45.310
Is something wrong? Don't go in there.

25:45.320 --> 25:48.780
No. I don't know.

25:50.790 --> 25:52.100
Where's Meghan?

25:52.110 --> 25:54.180
Oh,I don't know. She
went home hours ago.

25:54.190 --> 25:55.950
She's the money. I'm the brains.

25:55.960 --> 25:59.110
She leaves early. I stay
late. America,America.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.650
- Here.
- Thank you.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.020
How about I follow you home?

26:05.030 --> 26:06.760
I'd like that.

26:06.770 --> 26:08.400
And you'll view the
suspects from in here.

26:08.410 --> 26:12.670
You'll be able to see them and hear
them, but they won't be able to see you.

26:12.680 --> 26:16.050
Mr. Carmer,I'd like to introduce you
to an associate of mine, Allison Dubois.

26:16.060 --> 26:17.950
Allison,this is Tim Carmer.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.080
Dubois? Are you any relation to...

26:20.090 --> 26:21.290
Joe's my husband.

26:21.300 --> 26:25.200
Actually,Mrs. Dubois here was instrumental in
getting us to take another look at your case.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.730
She actually pointed us
towards a possible suspect that,

26:27.740 --> 26:29.930
uh, we missed the first time around.

26:29.950 --> 26:31.970
I,uh,consult with the police department,

26:31.980 --> 26:34.790
so when my husband mentioned that
your wife's murder was unsolved...

26:34.810 --> 26:38.920
My God,that's... nice of you.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.970
I was stunned when the
detective called me this morning.

26:40.980 --> 26:44.500
I had given up any hope of ever
finding the man who did this.

26:44.510 --> 26:47.580
Well,we can't actually be sure
we've found him yet,Mr. Carmer.

26:47.590 --> 26:50.400
Not until you identify him.

26:50.410 --> 26:52.980
Should we give this a whirl?

26:56.970 --> 26:59.870
Take as much time as you need.

27:04.590 --> 27:08.720
Could you ask #3 to step
a little closer,please?

27:10.100 --> 27:12.920
#3,could you step forward,please?

27:27.990 --> 27:31.790
I'm sorry. I just can't be sure.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.020
Uh,I just don't get it.

27:42.030 --> 27:45.420
I see him so clearly in my head,Joe.

27:45.430 --> 27:49.380
I know,honey,but it's not
your word they're looking for.

27:49.390 --> 27:50.830
Um,so,listen...

27:50.840 --> 27:53.150
uh,I spoke to our
mechanic about the SUV,

27:53.170 --> 27:55.490
and he actually has somebody
else who might be interested.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.140
Um,the guy wants to come by
and see it tomorrow afternoon.

27:58.150 --> 28:00.530
Thing is,he doesn't want to drive
all the way downtown to my office.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.110
He'd rather come here.

28:02.120 --> 28:06.930
Um,is there any chance we could carpool in
the morning so the car will be here for him?

28:06.940 --> 28:08.810
Well,sure.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.420
As long as I don't have to get in it.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.340
No,you don't have to get in it.

28:13.140 --> 28:15.220
I think the guy just wants
to see what it looks like.

28:15.230 --> 28:18.940
The mechanic already has him
convinced it runs like a top.

28:20.810 --> 28:23.840
You know what-what was nice?

28:25.100 --> 28:26.380
Do you know what was nice?

28:26.390 --> 28:30.100
The way you showed up
at the office last night.

28:30.110 --> 28:32.780
Just kind of out of nowhere.

28:32.790 --> 28:37.480
I mean,I told you I didn't actually need
the wallet, but you brought it over anyway.

28:37.940 --> 28:40.260
That was nice.

28:43.310 --> 28:45.660
I... I have a confession to make.

28:45.670 --> 28:50.560
Oh,really? We like
confessions. Is it juicy?

28:50.900 --> 28:53.240
Not really.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.140
I,uh...

28:56.150 --> 28:58.390
I fell asleep on the couch last night.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.090
I had a dream just before you
called to ask about your wallet.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.960
Okay. Something you want to share?

29:04.970 --> 29:06.350
In the dream,

29:06.360 --> 29:11.370
you heard about your idea
from the patent people.

29:12.130 --> 29:15.970
No one else had thought of it. No
one else in the whole wide world.

29:17.030 --> 29:21.740
And... you and Meghan
were really happy about it.

29:23.870 --> 29:26.860
That why I brought you your wallet.

29:26.870 --> 29:31.780
I thought, maybe it's really
going to happen tonight.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.860
And I don't want to miss it.

29:34.870 --> 29:37.590
I want to be there
when he's really happy.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.070
So,now,what does this mean?

29:40.080 --> 29:43.920
I mean,is there a statute of dream
limitations on these kind of things?

29:43.930 --> 29:45.540
When will I hear about the patent?

29:45.560 --> 29:50.080
And is it going to come true?
Is-Is the news going to be good?

29:53.200 --> 29:58.200
I don't know. I'm the woman who said
that her car was going to blow up.

29:59.020 --> 30:02.410
Well,that's not very encouraging.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.300
Recognize him?

30:06.310 --> 30:08.460
This is our guy. My guy.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.050
The man from the lineup yesterday.

30:10.070 --> 30:11.980
I-I don't understand.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.240
He's a model, a male model.

30:14.250 --> 30:17.880
Oh,when he isn't, uh,carjacking
and killing people, you mean?

30:18.310 --> 30:21.040
Well,I can't vouch for that,
but,uh,I did do some checking,

30:21.050 --> 30:23.350
and a lot of other people
can vouch for the fact

30:23.360 --> 30:27.350
that this fellow wasn't even in Phoenix
on the night that Mrs. Carmer was shot.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.820
Apparently,he was in Los Angeles on
some kind of a modeling assignment.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.600
A model?

30:32.610 --> 30:35.320
I saw him in the mug book you gave me.

30:35.330 --> 30:38.160
He looks exactly like the
man I keep seeing in my head.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.530
Well,he was in the mug
book because,uh,apparently,

30:40.550 --> 30:44.530
he feels the need to augment his modeling
income with the occasional petty theft.

30:44.540 --> 30:48.620
Some of that might be because he's also
trying to support a minor drug habit.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.230
I don't know what to tell you,Allison.

30:50.240 --> 30:54.870
The answer to the question, "Who killed
Rory Carmer?" is not this fellow here.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.480
You're going to make
me get in,aren't you?

31:42.590 --> 31:46.370
Route guidance is now active.

31:47.010 --> 31:51.490
Destination ahead 7.9 miles.

31:51.500 --> 31:56.290
Destination ahead 7.9 miles.

31:59.820 --> 32:04.290
Destination ahead 7.9 miles.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.350
Your route guidance will start now.

32:21.690 --> 32:26.190
Destination ahead 5.3 miles.

32:35.150 --> 32:38.610
Home is ahead one-quarter mile.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.340
Home?

32:40.350 --> 32:42.840
Right turn ahead.

32:42.850 --> 32:45.660
Turn right now.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.450
Home is 100 feet ahead on the right.

32:59.450 --> 33:01.870
You are home.

33:06.190 --> 33:08.770
Not my home.

33:11.980 --> 33:14.110
Oh,my gosh!

33:14.120 --> 33:17.000
Turn right now.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.810
Wait. What are you talking
about? Turn right where?

33:21.820 --> 33:24.840
Turn right now.

33:30.180 --> 33:33.550
Turn right now.

33:38.330 --> 33:42.740
Your destination is ahead in 20 feet.

33:45.020 --> 33:47.670
Ten feet.

33:50.290 --> 33:53.080
Five feet.

33:54.530 --> 33:57.540
Three feet.

33:58.840 --> 34:02.450
Destination nine inches ahead.

34:03.400 --> 34:07.500
Destination four inches ahead.

34:10.810 --> 34:14.290
You have arrived at your destination.

34:48.690 --> 34:50.580
Help!

34:50.590 --> 34:53.630
Please! Somebody!

35:13.090 --> 35:15.720
I can't believe I let you drag me
to that movie in the first place.

35:15.730 --> 35:19.890
Not only was it moronic, it
was long. Look at the time.

35:20.380 --> 35:23.370
I'm sorry you didn't like the film,dear.

35:23.710 --> 35:26.550
What on earth? Not a second one.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.320
This way you know how
far over you can be.

35:29.330 --> 35:33.570
As if I don't know how to park
my own car in my own garage.

35:33.580 --> 35:35.770
When did you put this
nonsense up anyway?

35:35.790 --> 35:38.190
This afternoon.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.980
That's why you parked my car in the
driveway and let the sprinklers get it wet.

35:41.990 --> 35:44.670
Oh,for goodness' sakes...

35:44.680 --> 35:47.100
Wait. I haven't shown
you the best part yet.

35:47.110 --> 35:49.260
What,Tim? What is the best part?

35:49.270 --> 35:53.350
Look. Over there.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.820
I-I-I don't
see anything.

35:55.830 --> 35:59.520
Inside the vise. Do you see?

36:01.120 --> 36:03.610
What is that? It
almost looks like a gun.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.900
It is. It is a gun.

36:06.910 --> 36:09.050
What on earth is that doing there?

36:09.060 --> 36:10.450
Watch.

36:54.730 --> 36:56.490
Hey,thanks for giving me a ride,Lee.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.330
I didn't know who else to call.

36:58.340 --> 37:00.470
Joe doesn't have a car today.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.770
It's fine,Allison.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.960
I'm still trying to make sense
out of everything you just told me.

37:07.970 --> 37:10.480
You and me both.

37:10.490 --> 37:11.740
So let's say that is what happened.

37:11.750 --> 37:15.170
Let's say he did kill
her. How do we prove it?

37:15.180 --> 37:18.770
I-I don't know. Get a
search warrant, find the gun.

37:18.780 --> 37:22.230
No judge is going to give me a warrant
on the basis of a dream or a hallucination

37:22.240 --> 37:24.390
or whatever it was you had back there.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.870
Frankly,I'd be amazed
if he still had the gun.

37:27.880 --> 37:32.610
Might be some blowback on the vise we could tie
to whatever they recover from the car,but still.

37:32.940 --> 37:37.150
I'll never get a warrant to take a
forensics team in there and find out.

37:38.380 --> 37:41.730
Boy,I'd love to talk to him again;
love to take a look around that garage.

37:41.740 --> 37:43.150
Well,it's wide open.

37:43.160 --> 37:46.050
The car's sitting right there.
The keys are in the ignition...

37:46.060 --> 37:49.040
if the garage hasn't
closed itself already.

37:49.050 --> 37:52.550
That's certainly going to freak
him out when he gets back from work.

37:52.970 --> 37:56.100
I'd expect some angry
phone calls tonight.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.140
I guess he heard you.

38:01.350 --> 38:02.440
Hello?

38:02.450 --> 38:04.330
Allison,what the hell's going on?

38:04.340 --> 38:06.110
What do you mean? What
are you talking about?

38:06.120 --> 38:09.740
The guy I told you about came by
the house to see the car today.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.620
He couldn't find anything.
He couldn't find you.

38:13.090 --> 38:16.020
Oh,my God. I'm so sorry,Joe.

38:16.030 --> 38:20.180
I don't even know... how to begin.

38:20.190 --> 38:23.530
Well,it doesn't matter
now. He's never coming back.

38:24.340 --> 38:27.540
Hey,when you coming home?
When can I come pick you up?

38:27.550 --> 38:30.180
When the time comes, I'll
probably just take a cab.

38:30.190 --> 38:32.680
It might not be until really late.

38:32.690 --> 38:35.760
We got word the patent
guys might call tonight.

38:35.770 --> 38:39.910
She's got a,um, she's
got a date and I'm...

38:39.920 --> 38:43.340
since I'm the minority partner, I've
got to sit and baby-sit the phones.

38:43.390 --> 38:46.070
I don't get it. Why do they have
to call in the middle of the night?

38:46.080 --> 38:47.900
Why can't they call your cell?

38:47.910 --> 38:51.110
Allison,I don't know. It's Eastern
Europe. There's a time difference.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.390
I don't know why she didn't
give them my cell,but she didn't.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.250
Look,I've got to go now.

38:56.270 --> 38:58.240
I'm sorry about the car.

38:58.250 --> 39:01.000
Oh,we'll figure it out.

39:05.950 --> 39:08.430
Thanks for the ride,Lee.
Thanks for everything.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.620
Hey,you know what?

39:11.720 --> 39:15.820
You need someone to pick up the SUV
from Carmer,right? It's still yours.

39:16.710 --> 39:20.380
Maybe I'll drop by Carmer's tonight,
drive over there with another officer.

39:20.390 --> 39:21.590
Say we're there to pick up the car.

39:21.610 --> 39:24.170
Use it as an excuse to
go through the garage.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.670
You get your car back.
Maybe I get some evidence.

39:26.680 --> 39:29.630
Oh,my God, that would be amazing.

39:31.140 --> 39:32.550
Power.

39:32.560 --> 39:36.720
It takes many forms,
revealing itself in many ways.

39:36.730 --> 39:40.660
"At the bottom of a hill
lived Jack and his mother.

39:40.670 --> 39:46.160
"And by the side of their little cottage,
Jack had planted a very large bean."

39:46.170 --> 39:48.440
Is this Jack and the Beanstalk?

39:48.450 --> 39:51.300
That's a boy story,Mom.
You can't read a boy story.

39:51.310 --> 39:55.230
- Dad's got to read that.
- Yeah,that's a boy story.

39:55.240 --> 39:57.450
The idea that a waterfall
a thousand miles away

39:57.460 --> 40:02.110
makes it possible for me to
turn on a lamp seems like magic.

40:02.530 --> 40:05.140
That I can fill a bathtub with hot
water in the middle of the night

40:05.150 --> 40:08.130
makes no logical sense,either.

40:08.530 --> 40:11.410
Electricity,serendipity...

40:11.420 --> 40:17.500
they both surround us, both doing
their work silently, invisibly.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.180
Lee?

40:23.450 --> 40:25.430
You hear something?

40:35.510 --> 40:36.670
Hello?

40:36.680 --> 40:38.920
You love me?

40:38.930 --> 40:41.490
Of course I love you.

40:42.260 --> 40:45.000
Did you get your call?
Are you coming home?

40:45.010 --> 40:47.160
No,no,and yes.

40:47.170 --> 40:50.340
I got another call. I
found a buyer for the SUV.

40:50.350 --> 40:51.740
You're kidding?

40:51.750 --> 40:57.800
it turns out that mechanic is serious about
how much he loves Carmer's death-mobile.

40:57.810 --> 40:59.290
He wants to buy it.

40:59.300 --> 41:02.550
And he's willing to pay us
$500 more than we paid Carmer,

41:02.570 --> 41:04.730
which is a good thing because
I think we're going to need it.

41:04.740 --> 41:06.850
What do you mean? What for?

41:07.160 --> 41:12.310
He thinks I'm nuts and I think I'm nuts, but
I told him to go ahead and fix your old car.

41:12.320 --> 41:16.980
Joe,that is so exciting!
That is fantastic!

41:16.990 --> 41:20.260
Honey,hold on a second.
I'm getting another call.

41:20.430 --> 41:21.860
Hello?

41:21.870 --> 41:24.030
Allison,it's Lee. You sitting down?

41:24.040 --> 41:26.160
Well,kind of.

41:26.190 --> 41:28.530
He's dead,Allison.

41:28.540 --> 41:30.200
What are you talking about?

41:30.220 --> 41:34.090
Tim Carmer,he died from
carbon monoxide poisoning.

41:34.100 --> 41:38.510
When we got here,we noticed the garage
door was down, locked up tight as a drum.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.460
You could hear the SUV running in there.

41:41.470 --> 41:44.110
Oh,my God.

41:44.120 --> 41:49.090
I just kept thinking about that story you
told me this afternoon, and wondering...

41:49.100 --> 41:52.020
was this something he did to himself?

41:52.030 --> 41:57.520
Or you think maybe
he,uh... It's crazy,right?

42:02.850 --> 42:05.690
Hey,Al,you still there?

42:10.800 --> 42:13.870
It's okay. I think...
I think I lost her.

42:14.260 --> 42:17.370
I thought you were
out with the boyfriend.

42:17.380 --> 42:19.600
Best-laid plans...

42:19.630 --> 42:22.370
Or not laid,as the case may be.
