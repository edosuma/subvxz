<i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

00:06.464 --> 00:07.590
(tires screech)

00:09.426 --> 00:10.510
D'oh!

00:10.593 --> 00:13.054
-Aah!
-(tires screech)

00:28.361 --> 00:30.697
<i>Ai! Que agonia!</i>

00:30.780 --> 00:33.074
(laughing)

00:33.158 --> 00:36.494
Oh, he wants
that corn so much.

00:38.663 --> 00:41.708
<i>Ai! Dios no me ama.</i>

00:43.334 --> 00:44.836
So good.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.797
Huh? I want to see what's
on the other broadcasts.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.883
Where's the oscillator
on this thing?

00:49.966 --> 00:51.843
-No, Grampa, don't!
-No, Grampa, don't!

00:51.926 --> 00:53.762
-Dad, sit down!
-Gosh darn it!

00:53.845 --> 00:55.555
What does this do?

00:55.638 --> 00:58.683
I'll make my adjustments
here and...

00:58.767 --> 01:00.226
(glass shattering)

01:03.104 --> 01:05.732
(tires screeching)

01:05.815 --> 01:09.110
(together)
Yay! We're getting a new TV!

01:09.194 --> 01:10.737
Let's go to
The Sharper Image.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.031
They've got a TV shaped
like a '50s diner.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.283
No, let's go
to The Nature Company.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.869
They've got a TV
assembled by Hopi Indians.

01:17.952 --> 01:21.414
We can't afford to shop at
any store that has a philosophy.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.041
We just need a TV.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.002
We're going to go
to the outlet mall in Ogdenville.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.796
(moaning)

01:46.397 --> 01:49.025
(gasps) Look at these
low, low prices

01:49.109 --> 01:50.693
on famous brand-name
electronics.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.446
Don't be a sap, Dad.
These are just crappy knock-offs.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.658
(scoffs) I know a genuine
Panaphonics when I see it.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.536
And look, there's
Magnetbox and Sorny.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.287
Listen, I'm not going
to lie to you.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.039
Those are all
superior machines,

02:03.123 --> 02:05.083
but if you like
to watch your TV--

02:05.166 --> 02:07.418
and I mean,
really watch it--

02:07.502 --> 02:09.045
you want the Carnivale.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.131
It features
two-pronged wall plug,

02:11.214 --> 02:12.882
pre-molded
hand-grip well,

02:12.966 --> 02:15.301
durable outer casing
to prevent fall-apart...

02:15.385 --> 02:18.972
Sold. You wrap it up,
I'll start bringing in the pennies.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.478
Honey, I don't think
these clothes are us.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.855
Who are they?

02:26.938 --> 02:28.189
Hey, Brandine

02:28.273 --> 02:30.108
you can wear this shirt to work.

02:30.191 --> 02:33.194
Oh, Cletus, you know I got to wear
the shirt what Dairy Queen give me.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.658
Hey, Mom, there's
something in here.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.493
Ooh.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.745
Oh, it's beautiful.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.706
Can it be a real Chanel?

02:44.789 --> 02:46.666
(gasps)
It is!

02:48.084 --> 02:49.627
90 dollars?

02:49.711 --> 02:50.795
(groans)

02:50.879 --> 02:53.131
But it's marked
down from 2,800.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.017
Oh, you look
so sophisticated.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.977
Just like Mary Hart.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.937
It fits like
a dream too.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.606
But we can't
afford $90

03:09.689 --> 03:11.482
even if it is
a bargain.

03:11.566 --> 03:14.485
It wouldn't be right to
buy something just for me.

03:14.569 --> 03:18.114
If it were a suit we could
all wear, maybe, then...

03:18.198 --> 03:20.408
Come on Mom, you never treat
yourself to anything.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.160
Oh, sure, I do.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.162
I treated myself to a Sanka
not three days ago.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.790
But this is a real find.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.083
Just buy it.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.919
You don't have to
rationalize everything.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.046
(groans)

03:33.129 --> 03:35.423
All right, I will buy it.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.300
It will be good
for the economy.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.762
(easy listening music plays)

03:42.472 --> 03:43.640
(whistles)

03:43.723 --> 03:45.516
You look great.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.435
Really?
You like it?

03:47.518 --> 03:50.271
Oh, I'd love to wear this
someplace special.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.566
Spurlock's Cafeteria,
it is.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.944
Mmm. What about
the symphony or the theater?

03:56.027 --> 03:57.195
Oh, gah, geez.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.780
What's the point
of going out?

03:58.863 --> 04:01.115
We're just going to
wind up back here, anyway.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.951
(groans)

04:03.034 --> 04:06.454
(singing in Italian)

04:06.537 --> 04:08.039
(vacuum starts)

04:14.379 --> 04:17.966
Oh, Mrs. Simpson, you are
looking very prosperous today.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.385
Might I interest you
in some of our impulse items

04:20.468 --> 04:21.761
here by the cash register?

04:21.844 --> 04:24.681
Perhaps a crazy motorized
wiggle pen?

04:24.764 --> 04:27.183
(laughing)
Look at... the craziness.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.186
Attendant, I'd like some gas.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.147
Yes, I'm sorry,
I do not speak English okay.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.649
But you were
just talking to...

04:34.732 --> 04:37.568
Yes, hot dog, hot dog,
yes, sir, no sir, maybe, okay.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.195
Well, I can't pump it myself.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.697
I'm calling triple "A."

04:40.780 --> 04:42.657
I used to be a little
overwhelmed too

04:42.740 --> 04:44.200
but it's not that hard.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.493
I can show you.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.537
Marge? Is that you?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.664
Marge Bouvier,
from high school?

04:49.747 --> 04:51.666
Um... yeah.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.584
Hi. Hi, Evelyn.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.211
How about that.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.005
Marge,
you look wonderful.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.841
And to think I heard
you married Homer Simpson.

04:59.924 --> 05:00.842
I did marry Homer.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.846
Come, you must
show me the pumps.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.682
90% of the time,
if the gas isn't pumping,

05:07.765 --> 05:09.225
this is your problem.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.228
Automotive skills
and fashion sense.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.855
Well, you've come a long way

05:13.938 --> 05:15.815
from the girl I knew
nothing about in high school.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.650
We ran with different crowds.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.444
You had your
debutante balls

05:19.527 --> 05:21.237
and skinny-dipping,

05:21.321 --> 05:23.281
and I had my...

05:23.364 --> 05:25.533
home shoe repair course.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.618
Oh, Marge, you haven't
changed a bit

05:27.702 --> 05:29.412
as far as I know.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.581
Say, why don't you drop by
the country club tomorrow?

05:31.664 --> 05:33.583
Oh, and bring the family.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.755
(antique horn honking)

05:38.838 --> 05:41.758
You there, fill it up
with petroleum distillate

05:41.841 --> 05:44.093
and re-vulcanize my tires,
post haste.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.140
Bart, comb your hair.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.310
Homer, I don't think you should
wear a short-sleeved shirt

05:52.393 --> 05:53.519
with a tie.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.104
Oh, but Sipowicz does it.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.106
If Detective Sipowicz
jumped off a cliff,

05:57.190 --> 05:58.274
would you do that too?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.026
Aw, I wish I was
Sipowicz.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.694
Do I have to go?

06:01.778 --> 06:03.988
That country club is a hotbed
of exclusionist snobs

06:04.072 --> 06:05.948
and status-seeking
social-climbers.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.118
I've told you, I don't like
you using the word "hotbed."

06:09.202 --> 06:12.663
Please, Lisa, we so rarely
get to do things like this.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.541
And everybody, everybody please,
be on your best behavior.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.293
Bart, no grifting.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.004
Ah, raspberries.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.009
Name, please?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.928
Simpson family.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.137
We're not poor.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.766
Well, we're not.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.518
Go on in.
They're expecting you at the clubhouse.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.606
(all gasping)

06:38.689 --> 06:40.691
Wow. Living large.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.026
Oh, my.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.112
I've always dreamed
of coming here.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.571
Everybody, keep smiling

06:45.655 --> 06:47.740
and I know we're going
to fit right in.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.286
(screams)

06:57.708 --> 06:59.419
EVELYN:
Oh, Marge. You made it.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.796
And you wore
that lovely suit.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.842
Kar-rin, Gill-ian, Elyza-beth

07:05.925 --> 07:08.761
Pa-tree-sia,
Rowber-tah, Seuss-in

07:08.845 --> 07:10.430
Meet Marge.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.348
-Hello.
-How you doing?

07:12.432 --> 07:15.059
Pleased to
meet you.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.813
You look like such a
happy bunch... of people.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.357
That's the trouble
with first impressions.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.151
You only get to make one.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.819
(ladies giggling)

07:24.902 --> 07:26.237
Oh.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.824
That reminds me of
a funny apron I saw.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.451
You know Marge, your family

07:31.534 --> 07:32.785
doesn't have to stand
in the alcove.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.871
They're free
to enjoy the club.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.622
(sighing)

07:36.706 --> 07:39.500
Ugh, come on kids,
let's go sit in the car

07:39.584 --> 07:41.294
till your Mom's done
fitting in.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.339
Elyza-beth is right.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.675
Why shout yourself hoarse
at incompetent sales clerks

07:47.758 --> 07:50.887
when you can get nearly
everything mail order?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.180
Um hum, I won't eat
anything

07:52.263 --> 07:53.473
unless it's
shipped overnight

07:53.556 --> 07:55.349
from Vermont or
Washington state.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.935
We order our steaks
through the "New Yorker."

07:58.019 --> 07:59.770
I have a sneaking suspicion that

07:59.854 --> 08:02.648
L.L. Bean and Eddie Bauer
are selling me the same honey.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.774
(ladies tittering)

08:03.858 --> 08:05.860
I get food
through the mail,

08:05.943 --> 08:07.612
but in a different way.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.197
Every month,
"Good Housekeeping"

08:09.280 --> 08:11.699
arrives in my mailbox,
bursting with recipes.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.868
Sometimes, the most
satisfying meal

08:13.951 --> 08:15.661
is the one you
cook yourself.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.996
Hmm.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.873
That's very true, Marge.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.000
One night, Wif and I
came home late,

08:21.083 --> 08:22.793
and we decided not
to wake Iris

08:22.877 --> 08:25.671
and instead,
we microwaved our own soup.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.257
(women chattering)

08:28.341 --> 08:30.343
Of course,
it was a horrible mess,

08:30.426 --> 08:32.428
but Iris didn't mind
cleaning it up.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.846
(ladies tittering)

08:33.930 --> 08:35.097
Why can't my Thurston
be more like Wif?

08:35.181 --> 08:36.724
That Iris is a gem.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.395
MARGE: Didn't everybody have
a wonderful time?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.272
I thought it was so opulent

08:43.356 --> 08:46.234
like the Playboy mansion,
but nonsexual.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.527
That place is weird.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.945
A man in the bathroom

08:49.028 --> 08:51.447
kept handing me towels
till I paid him to stop.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.949
Should have held out
longer, boy.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.034
The rich are different
from you and me.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.202
Yes, they're better.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.331
Socially better,
and if we fit in

09:00.414 --> 09:02.124
we can be better too.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.085
So today, while the rest of you
were out being different,

09:04.168 --> 09:06.546
I did a very good job of
fitting in--

09:06.629 --> 09:08.673
so good that Evelyn
gave us a guest pass.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.341
They might even ask us to join.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.426
Boy, Marge!

09:12.510 --> 09:15.346
You must have really done
a number on those rich suckers.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.556
Don't thank me.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.516
Thank my beautiful
new suit.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.356
Oh, Fritz, you idiot.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.567
I didn't order
a bologna sandwich.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.443
I ordered an abalone sandwich.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.488
I don't know
what Mom's thinking.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.574
This whole country club scene
is so decadent.

09:34.657 --> 09:38.160
All these... spoiled... brats...
and... their... smug

09:38.244 --> 09:39.996
complacent parents.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.999
It just reinforces
the unspoken class... system...

09:43.082 --> 09:45.334
of horses... sitting...
on... their... high... horses.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.086
I'm sorry. I got to go!

09:55.177 --> 09:57.096
<i>Oh. We've got a winning hand.</i>

09:57.179 --> 09:58.806
<i>We can take</i>
<i>the rest of the tricks.</i>

09:58.889 --> 10:00.474
<i>Oh, you better be careful.</i>

10:00.558 --> 10:02.268
<i>The purpose of this game</i>
<i>is to make friends.</i>

10:02.351 --> 10:03.853
<i>You don't make friends</i>
<i>by winning.</i>

10:03.936 --> 10:05.896
<i>Still, there's nothing</i>
<i>more popular</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:07.315
<i>than a gracious winner.</i>

10:07.398 --> 10:09.358
<i>Don't ask me.</i>
<i>I'm just hair.</i>

10:09.442 --> 10:12.111
<i>Your head stopped</i>
<i>18 inches ago.</i>

10:12.194 --> 10:13.070
Hmm...

10:13.154 --> 10:14.530
Queen of hearts.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.907
I believe all the rest
are ours.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.451
Oh, well played.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.036
We could have stopped them

10:20.119 --> 10:22.038
if you had changed
to a different suit.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.914
I thought, perhaps,
changing suits

10:23.998 --> 10:25.541
had gone out of fashion.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.917
Eh, Marge?

10:27.001 --> 10:28.377
(women tittering)

10:28.461 --> 10:29.378
(Marge grumbles)

10:31.339 --> 10:32.632
D'oh!

10:32.715 --> 10:36.510
(moaning)

10:38.512 --> 10:39.930
Mmm.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.641
(chuckling)

10:41.724 --> 10:42.975
You know, Homer,

10:43.059 --> 10:44.560
the traditional way
to cheat in golf

10:44.644 --> 10:46.062
is to lower your score.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.396
That's one way.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.523
I'm P.G.A. Tour
Pro Tom Kite.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.276
How about I give you a
few pointers on your game?

10:52.360 --> 10:54.570
Now, you don't want
to overthink.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.780
Not an issue.

10:55.863 --> 10:56.781
Keep your head down.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.157
Huh?

10:58.240 --> 11:00.576
Pretend there's
no one else here.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.952
(belches)

11:02.036 --> 11:03.829
And just go at your own pace.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.876
Wow, very impressive.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.461
You're a natural,
Mr. Simpson.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.004
Really?

11:12.088 --> 11:14.507
Uh-huh. All you need is
your own set of clubs

11:14.590 --> 11:17.051
and stay the hell
out of my locker.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.386
You can keep the shoes.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.432
Marge, did you know that

11:23.516 --> 11:25.434
Kennedy and Lincoln
had the same handicap?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.645
Homer, please,
I have to alter this suit

11:27.728 --> 11:29.480
so it looks different
for tomorrow.

11:29.563 --> 11:30.898
(yawning)

11:30.981 --> 11:32.483
Just slap some
bumper stickers on it

11:32.566 --> 11:34.735
and come to bed,
will you, Marge?

11:36.904 --> 11:38.072
(snoring)

11:42.201 --> 11:44.120
Love your outfit, Marge.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.913
The vest says,
"let's have lunch"

11:45.996 --> 11:47.665
but the culottes say,
"you're paying."

11:47.748 --> 11:50.334
Why, thank you, Rowber-ta.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.711
LISA:
Mom, look!

11:51.794 --> 11:54.755
I found something
more fun than complaining.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.676
Marge, your family

11:58.759 --> 12:01.053
is fitting in
perfectly here.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.013
If all goes well
at Saturday's ball,

12:03.097 --> 12:05.558
I'd love to sponsor
you for membership.

12:05.641 --> 12:08.936
Oh, that would be
a dream come true.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.813
I'll be there
with bells on.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.231
Bells?

12:12.314 --> 12:14.066
Where exactly
will you be attaching them

12:14.150 --> 12:15.693
to that mangled Chanel suit?

12:15.776 --> 12:18.028
(ladies laughing)

12:18.112 --> 12:19.530
Oh, don't worry, Marge.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.073
Her idea of wit
is nothing more

12:21.157 --> 12:23.701
than an incisive observation
humorously phrased

12:23.784 --> 12:25.327
and delivered
with impeccable timing.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.121
I'm sure you'll be
a smash at the ball,

12:27.204 --> 12:30.082
and I just know you'll have
a lovely new outfit.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.086
(repeated toilet splashes)

12:39.008 --> 12:40.676
Hey, that's some mighty fine
chipping, Homer.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.720
Yeah, can you bank it into
the handicapped stall?

12:42.803 --> 12:44.430
Seat-- down.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.099
(air dryer blowing)

12:47.183 --> 12:50.102
(ball splashes)

12:50.186 --> 12:53.063
Hmm. Who is that lavatory
linksman, Smithers?

12:53.147 --> 12:54.565
Homer Simpson, sir--

12:54.648 --> 12:56.734
One of the fork and spoon
operators from Sector 7G.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.986
Well, he's certainly got
a loose waggle.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.322
Perhaps I've finally
found a golfer

13:01.405 --> 13:03.866
worthy of a match
with Monty Burns, eh?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.618
Oh, his waggle is no match
for yours, sir.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.411
I've never seen
you lose a game

13:07.495 --> 13:09.747
except for that one in '74,
when you let Richard Nixon win.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.499
That was very kind of you, sir.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.126
Oh, he just looked
so forlorn, Smithers

13:14.210 --> 13:16.587
with his, "Oh, I can't
go to prison, Monty.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.297
They'll eat me alive."

13:19.757 --> 13:21.425
Say, I wonder if this
Homer Nixon

13:21.509 --> 13:22.551
is any relation.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.136
Unlikely, sir. They...

13:24.220 --> 13:25.971
They spell and pronounce
their name differently.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.933
Bah. Schedule a game
and I'll ask him myself.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.937
Oh, this game could mean
big things for me, Marge.

13:33.020 --> 13:36.816
If I beat Mr. Burns..
I mean really wallop him bad,

13:36.899 --> 13:39.276
I'm sure to get that big raise
I've been gunning for.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.028
Alright, alright, but if you
win, don't make a scene

13:41.111 --> 13:43.948
and dance around
with your "whoo-hoos," please.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.950
We can't afford
a single slip-up.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.034
They're judging us.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.953
Mwah!

13:49.036 --> 13:50.538
Mwah!

13:50.621 --> 13:53.123
Mom, did you like horses
when you were my age? 'Cause I--

13:53.207 --> 13:54.250
I don't know.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.918
Lisa, tonight is
very important.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.213
Mommy has to alter her suit
so it looks a totally new one.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.507
Mom, do you want to know the 15 reasons
I like horses better than cars?

14:01.590 --> 14:02.800
One, a horse never has to--

14:02.883 --> 14:04.051
I really need to concentrate
on this, Lisa.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.386
Would you mind just..?

14:05.469 --> 14:07.680
You know how a horse
goes like this?

14:07.763 --> 14:08.931
Mom! Like this!

14:09.014 --> 14:10.724
I've already altered
this so many times,

14:10.808 --> 14:13.143
-it's not even possible--
-Whinny! Mom! Mom! Mom!

14:13.227 --> 14:14.228
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom! Mom!

14:14.311 --> 14:16.272
Lisa, please!

14:22.736 --> 14:23.904
Hmm.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.657
(gasps)

14:26.740 --> 14:27.825
No.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.411
No, no, no, no!

14:30.494 --> 14:32.204
(cloth rips)

14:32.288 --> 14:33.873
(groaning)

14:33.956 --> 14:38.586
At times like this, I guess
all you can do is laugh.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.680
I need a formal dress
for tonight.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.640
You've come
to the right place.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.059
We've got classy duds
up the ying-yang.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.478
I call this one
"fantasy in maroon."

14:56.562 --> 14:58.063
It's got some
cigarette burns

14:58.147 --> 15:00.274
but we can patch them
up with Nu-Vinyl.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.319
It's a bit peppery for me.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.155
Why don't we put this
in the "maybe" pile?

15:06.238 --> 15:09.533
This was originally
a Halloween costume,

15:09.617 --> 15:12.202
but it found its way
into my regular rotation.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.662
Uh-huh.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.665
Good morning,
Mr. Burns.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.667
Beautiful day to be
outside, isn't it?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.210
Rant on, Simpson,

15:20.294 --> 15:21.754
but your
vainglorious boasting

15:21.837 --> 15:24.048
will only add savor
to my inevitable triumph.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.759
Yes.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.765
Woo-hoo!

15:32.848 --> 15:34.266
D'oh!

15:34.350 --> 15:36.977
Yes. You're
in deep "D'oh" now.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.313
(sandpaper scraping)

15:46.570 --> 15:48.238
Perfect as always, sir.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.865
Right on the green.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.832
Oh, quit cogitating,
Steinmetz,

15:58.916 --> 16:01.335
and use
an open-faced club.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.837
-The sand wedge.
-Mmm.

16:03.921 --> 16:07.257
Open-faced club sand wedge.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.265
You're four strokes
behind, Simpson.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.105
(chuckles)

16:21.188 --> 16:22.731
Oh, a cunning
stratagem, sir.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.110
It's curving right
toward the green,

16:26.193 --> 16:28.570
and it's... there.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.783
He got to the green
in one shot?

16:32.866 --> 16:37.830
How can that old man
hit so...

16:37.913 --> 16:39.665
far?

16:39.748 --> 16:41.166
Now, keep
your head down.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.127
Ignore all distractions.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.294
(yells)

16:49.008 --> 16:50.009
Hmm. Hmm.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.053
Hmm? Miss?

16:53.137 --> 16:55.389
Miss? Do you have
a Chanel suit

16:55.472 --> 16:57.099
or any other
high-quality clothes?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.851
No, ma'am, but we do have

16:58.934 --> 17:00.978
a shipment of slightly burnt
Sears activewear

17:01.061 --> 17:02.563
coming in this afternoon.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.731
Oh, I give up.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.692
What time and
how burnt?

17:06.775 --> 17:08.986
Cripes man, can't you ever
get to the green

17:09.069 --> 17:10.237
in less than two shots?

17:12.823 --> 17:13.949
SMITHERS: Aagh!

17:14.033 --> 17:14.908
(groans)

17:17.494 --> 17:19.079
Smithers, what
are you doing up here?

17:19.163 --> 17:20.414
What are you doing
with this ball?

17:20.497 --> 17:22.207
And all those
other balls?

17:22.291 --> 17:24.626
Ahh, there are
no other balls.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.754
Just these, uh,
reptile eggs.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.088
Ooh, step away.
They're endangered.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.260
These aren't reptile eggs.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.553
You've been cheating.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.096
No matter where
Mr. Burns hit the ball,

17:36.180 --> 17:38.223
you put a fresh one
on the green.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.266
(gasps)

17:39.349 --> 17:40.809
Cheating? For me?

17:40.893 --> 17:44.313
Good Lord, Smithers,
that's patently unnecessary.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.148
I'm one of the world's
finest golfers.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.983
In all the years
you've caddied for me,

17:48.067 --> 17:49.818
I've never lost a...

17:51.195 --> 17:53.238
-Oh.
-So...

17:53.322 --> 17:55.240
<i>♪ You're not</i>
<i>the best golfer here ♪</i>

17:55.324 --> 17:58.285
<i>♪ Wait till I tell</i>
<i>everyone about this ♪</i>

17:58.368 --> 18:00.287
<i>♪ You stink ♪</i>

18:00.370 --> 18:02.748
Homer, Mr. Burns holds
a lot of sway at this club.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.166
If you would keep quiet
about the alleged

18:04.249 --> 18:05.709
decades of cheating,

18:05.793 --> 18:06.710
I'm sure he'd support
your application

18:06.794 --> 18:08.128
for membership tonight.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.755
Bull honkey!
I don't care

18:09.838 --> 18:11.423
about joining
this stupid club.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.259
But does your wife?

18:14.343 --> 18:17.054
Ohh.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.472
(yells)

18:18.555 --> 18:20.140
I knew my kind
wasn't welcome here.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.231
(sighs loudly)

18:31.693 --> 18:33.112
-Ooh.
-Ooh.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.905
ALL:
Ahh.

18:34.988 --> 18:38.158
Mom, you are looking fabulous.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.743
Yeah. You look great.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.578
You can do anything
with that sewing machine.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.080
No, I can't.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.498
Come on, let's go.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.791
You mean it's a new dress?
Where did you get it?

18:45.874 --> 18:47.417
The outlet store.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.295
Wow. Two finds in one store.
What are the odds?

18:50.379 --> 18:52.339
-Call it fate, let's go!
-How much did it cost?

18:52.422 --> 18:54.091
-A dollar. Let's go.
-With tax or without?

18:54.174 --> 18:55.342
Without. Let me go.

18:55.425 --> 18:56.385
So with tax,
how much was it?

18:56.468 --> 18:57.469
Why do you always
have to question

18:57.553 --> 18:59.263
everything I do?

18:59.346 --> 19:00.931
You look nice, is all.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.437
MARGE:
Homer, what are you doing?

19:07.521 --> 19:08.897
I'm driving up
to the main building.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.357
They've got
valet parking tonight.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.109
We can't drive this up there.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.736
They'll see the dent.
They'll see the coat hanger antenna.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.446
Stop the car. We're walking.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.407
But Marge, valets.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.034
For once, maybe someone
will call me "sir"

19:21.118 --> 19:23.162
without adding,
"you're making a scene."

19:28.667 --> 19:31.211
I'm going to regale everyone
with my anecdote.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.589
You know, the one I tried
to say on the radio?

19:33.672 --> 19:35.799
Who's going to bleep me
this time?

19:35.883 --> 19:37.426
I'm going to pose
as an Italian count

19:37.509 --> 19:40.345
and get some old lady
to leave me all her money.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.847
I'm going to ask people

19:41.930 --> 19:43.682
if they know
their servants' last names

19:43.765 --> 19:46.226
or, in the case of butlers,
their first.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.353
No! No! No!
Not tonight!

19:50.314 --> 19:52.274
No vulgarity.
No mischief.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.526
No politics.
Just be good.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.197
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'll behave.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.449
I won't say anything controversial.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.784
I just won't say
anything, okay, honey?

20:08.999 --> 20:11.251
You kids
should thank your mother.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.920
Now that she's
a better person,

20:13.003 --> 20:15.380
we can see how
awful we really are.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.975
Come here, Maggie.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.519
Oh, Homie,

20:29.603 --> 20:31.939
I like your
in-your-face humanity.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.358
I like the way
Lisa speaks her mind.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.943
I like Bart's...

20:37.361 --> 20:40.197
I like Bart.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.324
And I like my old green dress.

20:42.407 --> 20:46.245
I didn't have to spend our
savings on this stupid gown.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.829
Our savings?

20:47.913 --> 20:49.665
Don't worry.
I saved the receipt.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.042
We'll have
a $3,300 credit at Chanel.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.585
They have beer
and gum, right?

20:55.712 --> 20:57.089
Come on, let's go.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.966
I wouldn't want
to join any club

20:59.049 --> 21:01.176
that would have
this me as a member.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.011
It's okay.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.930
Those snobs never would have
made us members, anyway.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.977
Well, I wonder
where Marge could be.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.479
She's missing
her own initiation.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.314
I hope she didn't take

21:14.398 --> 21:16.233
my attempt to destroy her
too seriously.

21:17.859 --> 21:18.986
Where's Homer?

21:19.069 --> 21:21.321
Oh, and to think
I spent all afternoon

21:21.405 --> 21:22.698
baking him this cake.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.743
Mmm. Grr...

21:26.827 --> 21:28.245
I pickled the figs myself.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.630
Hey, did you guys
just come from the prom?

21:38.714 --> 21:40.382
Sort of.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.343
But, you know, we realized
we're more comfortable

21:43.427 --> 21:45.053
in a place like this.

21:47.097 --> 21:50.142
Man, you're crazy.
This place is a dump.

21:50.225 --> 21:54.354
Oh man, I'd be anywhere
except this place, that's for sure.
