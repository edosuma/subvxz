07:55.320 --> 07:56.120
Sure.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.760
Car keys, house keys.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.000
I'm sure you can figure
out which one is which.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.560
Thanks.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.120
Hey.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.480
You're doing real good work.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.920
Ta.

08:10.040 --> 08:10.840
Mm.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.320
I miss this place.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.680
The feeling's not mutual, Rod.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.640
Don't get me wrong.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.960
Tirau's got a lot going for it.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.720
It's a real simple
question, Rod.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.640
Are you in or are you out?

08:22.760 --> 08:24.840
G'day, Ted.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.640
Rolling out the big guns,put the hard word on me, eh?

08:26.760 --> 08:27.560
You what?

08:27.680 --> 08:28.560
No, Rod.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.000
Five Give us a minute, will you?

08:30.120 --> 08:32.000
Sure.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.240
What's that prick doing here?

08:34.360 --> 08:35.840
He has a store in Tirau.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.440
We're just seeing if we
can work a bit smarter.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.040
So what brings you here?

08:40.160 --> 08:42.280
Do I need a reason to comeand see my beautiful wife?

08:42.400 --> 08:43.400
Yes.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.080
Shouldn't you be
running your book?

08:45.200 --> 08:47.640
Well, can't spend all
bloody day in the pub.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.120
Jeez.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.240
Most men I know I would
kill to have that job.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.400
Not me.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.720
Good to hear.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.080
But you can't spend
it here either.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.960
I'm busy.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.160
I know.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.000
Sometimes, beggars
can't be choosers.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.640
Hey, we're not beggars.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.960
It's a saying, Ted.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.200
Go home.

09:08.320 --> 09:11.440
Feed those bloody kids.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.640
Man, that sucks.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.440
Did they say why?

09:14.560 --> 09:17.080
Something about not beingpsychologically stable.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.880
But an army should be
full of crazy mothers

09:19.000 --> 09:20.360
who want to blow shit up.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.360
The territorialsclearly lack imagination.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.400
Perhaps you should become
a soldier of fortune.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.040
Sparky's sad because theterritorials turned him down.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.280
Good job.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
You don't want to be
a weekend warrior.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.200
Not when I've got you a gig.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.800
[imitates explosion]

09:35.920 --> 09:36.840
Really?

09:36.960 --> 09:37.720
Fish factory.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.720
Seriously?

09:38.840 --> 09:39.640
Are you ready for that?

09:39.760 --> 09:41.040
I was born ready.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.120
No, I mean, do youhave everything you need?

09:42.240 --> 09:43.520
The job goes tomorrow.

09:43.640 --> 09:44.960
I have everything Ineed right in this house.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.520
OK, that's kind of scary
when you think about it.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.880
It needs to look honest.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.040
There's honest arson?

09:49.160 --> 09:50.640
An electrical
fault. No comeback.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.440
Yeah, yeah.
A piece of piss.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.400
Hey, what about the fish?

09:53.520 --> 09:55.000
What about what fish?

09:55.120 --> 09:57.120
Well, we could take a fewboxes, make it easier to burn.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.040
Surely, he's going to strugglewith a concrete building

09:59.160 --> 10:00.960
full of ice.

10:01.080 --> 10:01.880
Evening, lads.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.080
[grunts] G'day.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.680
I got some Greasy's if--

10:05.800 --> 10:07.640
ah.

10:07.760 --> 10:08.520
Oh, well.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.400
Never mind.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.360
More the more for me, eh?

10:10.480 --> 10:11.240
Yeah.

10:16.960 --> 10:17.800
Right.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.560
Well, I'll leave you to it.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.240
Forget about the fish.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.000
There's a slight complication Ineed you to look after for me.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.800
There he is.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.520
My little dark horse.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.560
Are you being racist?

10:41.680 --> 10:43.080
No.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.000
Man, everyone's sobloody touchy these days.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.520
So what do you got for me, Bert?

10:48.640 --> 10:50.600
Let me guess-- nothing.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.280
No, a headache is whatI've got from all the talking

10:53.400 --> 10:54.600
they do.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.080
They being yourcolleagues in the struggle?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.760
Some of them.

10:58.880 --> 11:03.160
They say Mandela wept with joywhen he heard about Hamilton.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.000
He wept because he
knows the message

11:05.120 --> 11:08.400
we sent to the white minorityregime that day as we stood--

11:08.520 --> 11:11.320
All they do is talk
and march and chat.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.000
Sometimes, I wake up in
the middle of the night.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.000
One, two, three, four, wedon't want your racist tour.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.160
And I'm sweating, man.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.720
Even now, I just--

11:18.840 --> 11:20.480
I can't do this anymore.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.240
That little garage just
down off Palmer Drive,

11:24.360 --> 11:26.520
has that got anything
to do with you?

11:26.640 --> 11:27.640
Because I've been
meaning to check

11:27.760 --> 11:29.000
that out for quite some time.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.160
Come on, man.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.720
I'm doing my best here.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.640
I'm trying my best to fit in.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.320
At least Muldoon's
digging his own grave

11:35.440 --> 11:36.880
and he doesn't even know it, eh?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.520
Come the election,
he'll be toast, right?

11:39.640 --> 11:41.800
If only it was that simple.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.360
The itinerary for this
tour has been cooked up

11:44.480 --> 11:46.880
between the National
Party and the NZRFU

11:47.000 --> 11:48.920
to target the marginal
rural electorates.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.120
Muldoon will buy another
three years out of this.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.400
Mark my words.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.680
Come on, Bert.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.000
There must be something
you still like

11:55.120 --> 11:57.120
about fighting the good fight.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.320
Smoke?

11:58.440 --> 11:59.240
Yeah.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.480
Choice.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.280
It's only cabbage,
but that's OK.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.800
Isn't Dave amazing?

12:06.920 --> 12:10.600
His passion is off the scale.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.440
Focus on the good things.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.280
Tell me what I want,
and then I won't

12:14.400 --> 12:18.600
ever have to go down PalmerDrive to that little garage.

12:18.720 --> 12:19.520
Right?

12:48.320 --> 12:49.200
Nice painting.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.440
It is.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.760
Do you, uh, know
much about art?

12:53.880 --> 12:57.880
Enough to have a
degree in art history.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.560
And enough to tell Evanwhat he should be buying.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.520
Everything here, I
told what to buy.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.400
Shit.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.440
Exactly.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.520
You?

13:07.640 --> 13:10.800
You know anything about art?

13:10.920 --> 13:14.000
I know that some stuffis better than other stuff.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.600
Yes, it is.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.520
So I take it he gave you a key.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.040
Yes.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.720
A bit of a heads up whenyou're here would be good.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.520
Because sometimes I like towalk around the house naked.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.760
I'm having lunch with
my friend Veronica.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.680
You can drive me
when I'm dressed.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.520
Here.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.880
See you back here at 3:00.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.520
The Radical Action committeehave signed off on this, Riana.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.840
It's a done deal.
- It doesn't matter.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.160
It's still a terrible idea.

14:03.280 --> 14:03.960
DAVE: You don't have
to come if you don't.

14:04.080 --> 14:04.880
RIANA: I don't want.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.960
Fine then.

14:07.080 --> 14:07.840
What was that all about?

14:12.280 --> 14:14.760
Dave's got this dumb planto cut off the TV transmission

14:14.880 --> 14:15.960
to the outside world.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.400
How?

14:17.520 --> 14:18.800
Breaking into the satellitestation at Ackworth,

14:18.920 --> 14:20.080
taking everything with an axe.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.720
OK.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.400
That seems to me like somethingthe cops might have covered.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.360
Apparently, Dave knows a waythrough a neighboring farm.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.680
So while one group
districts the cops

14:27.800 --> 14:28.800
at the gate, Dave
and some others

14:28.920 --> 14:30.240
go in through the back way.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.520
But what if we get onthe pitch in Christchurch

14:31.640 --> 14:33.000
and no one in the world sees it?
- Exactly.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.280
My point exactly.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.360
I mean, if Mandela
wept about Hamilton,

14:36.480 --> 14:38.400
he'll weep buckets ifthey stop an actual test.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.640
That's what I
tried to tell them.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.200
But they want to
make a big statement.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.040
Yeah, it'd be way betterto cut the transmission here

14:43.160 --> 14:46.360
so the rugby heads don't getto watch their precious game.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.520
That would really piss them off.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.120
That would be so cool.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.480
MIKE [ON PHONE]:
What is it, Bert?

14:53.600 --> 14:55.200
You wanted something.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.720
I've got you something.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.440
But you got to promise tobe nicer to me in future.

15:11.000 --> 15:11.760
Bye.

15:11.880 --> 15:12.840
Where are you off to?

15:12.960 --> 15:14.840
A territorials thing.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.880
I thought they
gave you the flick.

15:17.000 --> 15:17.800
They changed their mind.

15:31.320 --> 15:34.200
[tires screeching]

15:52.200 --> 15:54.560
[door opens]

15:54.680 --> 15:58.040
[door closes]

16:01.720 --> 16:03.760
Oh.
Make yourself at home.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.000
I was doing something for Evan.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.640
Oh, aren't you a good boy?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.360
I thought I was supposedto pick you up at 3:00.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.600
Well, Veronica was beinga boring pain in the ass,

16:12.720 --> 16:14.840
so I got a taxi.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.680
Sorry to ruin your day plan.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.560
- Not at all.
- Then we're good.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.000
You fancy a drink?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.600
You could tell me your
life story if you want.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.880
Do you have a life story?

16:30.000 --> 16:30.840
Yes.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.720
I like the way you said that.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.120
Sounds promising.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.280
Come on.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.000
I can't.

16:37.120 --> 16:37.880
I have a thing to do.

16:38.000 --> 16:38.840
For Evan.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.760
Yes.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.280
Don't we all?
Right.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.320
Piss off then.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.720
Leave me here all alone.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.320
Was that her in the taxi?

16:51.440 --> 16:52.240
Yeah.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.520
Very tasty.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.440
WOLF: Just watch the house.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.360
If she leaves, follow her.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.800
Mm-hmm.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.360
And what do I do when Iget to where she's going.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.160
Watch her while she's there.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.520
And then what?

17:01.640 --> 17:02.840
Follow her back here.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.440
It's like "The Professionals."

17:04.560 --> 17:07.400
I'm Doyle, you're Bodie.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.640
No, it's not.

17:10.760 --> 17:11.520
Hey, Wolf?

17:11.640 --> 17:12.480
What.

17:12.600 --> 17:13.760
Look, just grab me one box.

17:13.880 --> 17:14.840
Anything but kahawai.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.360
Fucking terrible fish.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.200
I fixed that drawer.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.080
The one that was sticking.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.000
RITA: Uh-huh.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.280
Where's Wolf?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.360
Is he not downstairs?

17:30.480 --> 17:31.480
No.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.400
Hm.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.600
Maybe he's working late.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.920
TED: What does Wolf do forthis Lace bloke anyway?

17:39.040 --> 17:41.360
This and that, apparently.

17:41.480 --> 17:42.800
I thought you
set it up for him.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.400
RITA: Oh, I got him
the foot in the door,

17:44.520 --> 17:45.640
but after that, it's
all down to him.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.720
So you haven't talked to him?

17:51.840 --> 17:53.480
About what he's doing?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.040
Not really.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.280
You talk all the bloody time.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.640
It's not my fault
he's a mommy's boy.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.920
[laughs]

18:01.040 --> 18:02.720
He's learning about business.

18:02.840 --> 18:03.720
And that can't be a bad thing.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.680
TED: What about the other boys?

18:07.800 --> 18:09.120
What about them?

18:09.240 --> 18:12.520
Well, are they helpingWolf learn about business?

18:12.640 --> 18:15.840
No, they're doingwhatever it is that they do.

18:15.960 --> 18:16.720
I think it's just Wolf.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.160
Sparky?

18:25.280 --> 18:26.080
Sparky?

18:38.600 --> 18:39.360
DARIJO: Wait!

18:42.440 --> 18:44.280
I know this kid.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.680
This is Ted fucking West's boy.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.760
Did you know this, Ted?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.680
Did you know these boys
were doing such thing?

18:52.800 --> 18:53.840
No.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.320
No, I did not.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.400
My uncle Rocky has allthese problems with vandals.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.680
So we lie in wait.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.840
And they arrive.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.920
And he-- his bag full
of things to burn

19:04.040 --> 19:06.160
down my uncle's livelihood--

19:06.280 --> 19:08.640
the business he
built from nothing.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.440
I have great respect
for you, Ted.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.760
And I like your wife.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.280
But this is a crime
against my family.

19:15.400 --> 19:20.360
And for that, I could burythese boys anywhere in Auckland,

19:20.480 --> 19:21.600
and they would never be found.

19:21.720 --> 19:22.960
[whimpers]

19:23.080 --> 19:24.840
TED: It doesn't have to
come to that, Darijo.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.280
Rocky Simonich has
the best fish around.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.000
He's a good bloke in my book.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.280
So what have you
lot got against him?

19:31.400 --> 19:32.160
Nothing.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.240
It's just business.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.560
What business?

19:34.680 --> 19:37.400
Evan fucking Lace business.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.720
[snorts] [spits]
Oh, I'm sorry, Rita!

19:40.840 --> 19:42.160
I send cleaner tomorrow!

19:42.280 --> 19:44.160
Did that smarmy littleprick put you up to this?

19:44.280 --> 19:46.560
[phone ringing]

19:46.680 --> 19:48.920
Answer me.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.320
You, out, now.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.840
And you, go to your room.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.080
And will someone answer
that fucking phone?

19:54.200 --> 19:55.880
I'll get it.

19:56.000 --> 19:56.800
TED: Well, that's it.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.360
Hello?

19:58.480 --> 19:59.680
Whatever you're doing forthis bloke, OK, it is done.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.560
DARIJO: No, this is Darijo.TED: It is over.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.800
Wolf's a bit busy right now.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.280
Why?

20:04.400 --> 20:06.840
Because I will not havemy son doing the dirty work

20:06.960 --> 20:10.360
so some rich bastard can putdecent, honest people out

20:10.480 --> 20:11.600
of their livelihood.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.160
Are you having an
attack of morality?

20:13.280 --> 20:14.440
That's a laugh coming from you.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.440
Wolf, knock it off.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.680
What is that supposed to mean?

20:16.800 --> 20:17.800
You're not Robin
Hook, Dad, no matter

20:17.920 --> 20:18.760
how much you try and pretend.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.400
Excuse me.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.320
There's an upset woman
on phone for Wolf.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.240
Too bad.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.760
Tell her he's busy.

20:24.880 --> 20:28.200
In my family, worst thingyou can do to upset woman

20:28.320 --> 20:29.280
it tell her "too bad."

20:29.400 --> 20:30.480
Then they get violent.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.720
Oh, for God's sake.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.440
Hello?

20:35.560 --> 20:36.800
There's a fucking
pervert here.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.640
He's outside the house.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.640
Don't move.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.240
I'll be there as fast as I can.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.400
Oh, no, no, no, no.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.560
You're not going anywhere.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.880
Yes, I am.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.560
Don't walk away while
I'm talking to you.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.040
You take phone calls and walkout in the middle of the night

20:49.160 --> 20:50.840
all the time.
- That's different.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.560
It's work.
- Yeah, so is this.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.520
Wolf.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.440
Wolf!

20:57.200 --> 20:59.360
[laughs] Bloody
kids today, eh?

20:59.480 --> 21:00.240
No bloody respect.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.080
Fuck!

21:13.160 --> 21:16.480
So I get out of theshower and I'm drying myself

21:16.600 --> 21:19.640
and I hear this
weird moaning sound.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.800
And when I turn around, there'sthis guy looking in the window.

21:22.920 --> 21:26.960
I'm pretty sure he was whackingoff by the look on his face.

21:27.080 --> 21:27.880
I screamed.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
He ran away.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.080
I'll see if he's still around.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.040
If you'd be so kind.

21:43.080 --> 21:43.880
Hey!

21:44.000 --> 21:44.880
Psst.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.840
[imitates bird]

21:54.840 --> 21:57.320
OK, in my defense, I wasworried that I'd nodded off

21:57.440 --> 21:58.680
and maybe she'd slipped away.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.600
So I-- I went in
for a closer look.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.760
Now was it worth it, Eric?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.880
[LAUGHING] Oh, yes.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.600
Well, until she
started screaming.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.560
Now it's a bit of
a pickle, isn't it?

22:09.680 --> 22:11.200
Well, compared to
the rest of my night,

22:11.320 --> 22:12.560
this is actually easy to solve.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.400
- Is it?
- Yeah.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.000
What's going to happenis, I'm going to drag you

22:16.120 --> 22:17.240
into the middle of the street.
- Mm-hmm.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.720
And I'm going to
hit you very hard.

22:19.840 --> 22:20.880
And then you're
going to run away.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.240
Aye, but why?

22:22.360 --> 22:23.800
So that Joanne can see
that the pervert's gone.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.280
On that, do you
really have to hit me?

22:25.400 --> 22:29.080
No, but I want to.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.920
[grunting]

22:32.040 --> 22:34.760
Perv!

22:34.880 --> 22:38.640
That was very manly.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.720
Some weirdo.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.000
I'm pretty sure he was harmless.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.000
He's gone.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.520
Yeah, but can you stay?

22:52.280 --> 22:53.120
I'm sure he's gone.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.240
Just in case he comes back.

22:55.360 --> 22:56.640
You can sleep on the couch.

22:59.880 --> 23:00.960
Sure.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.360
I can do that for you.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.680
No, he's not quitting.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.880
I'm sorry?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.400
Am I missing something here?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.280
Just because you arehaving an attack of being Mr.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.400
bloody Righteous
doesn't mean that Wolf

23:12.520 --> 23:14.080
should be out of a job.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.160
Oh, so you're OK with our sonfire bombing innocent people?

23:16.280 --> 23:17.080
Innocent.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.760
Oh, Ted, spare me.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.960
Those bloody Dallies are
as bent as coat hangers,

23:22.080 --> 23:22.880
and you know that.

23:23.000 --> 23:23.880
Yeah, maybe.

23:24.000 --> 23:24.880
But they're are kind of bent.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.480
And Evan Lace is not.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.760
Besides, didn't you burndown a post office once?

23:30.880 --> 23:32.160
That's different.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.360
It was an accident.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.760
No.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.920
You told me it was an
anti-government protest.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.520
No.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.880
On the way in, Lefty chuckedhis fag into a rubbish bin.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.600
The place was well alightby the time we realized.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.560
I will sort Wolf out.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.640
You'll just blow up athim and then he'll leave.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.680
Well, maybe it's time he did.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.280
No, no, no.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.960
It's better that he's here.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.680
Then we can keep an eye on him.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.400
Well, you can
keep an eye on him.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.280
Exactly.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.680
Was it the couch?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.000
Is what the couch?

24:31.120 --> 24:33.400
The reason you're not asleep.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.520
No, I'm just not sleepy.

24:35.640 --> 24:39.400
Me neither, obviously.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.680
If you're worried aboutthat perv guy coming back,

24:41.800 --> 24:43.040
I guarantee you he's gone.

24:43.160 --> 24:46.160
No, I'm just not
good at sleeping.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.240
It's the one thing
I'm terrible at.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.800
The only thing?

24:49.920 --> 24:51.560
So you're amazing
at everything else?

24:51.680 --> 24:52.520
True.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.440
I am amazing at many things.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.760
Just not sleeping.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.920
What are you amazing at, Wolf?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.080
Can I get back to you on that?

25:01.200 --> 25:02.440
Right.

25:02.560 --> 25:03.760
So being decisive clearlyisn't one of them.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.120
Hell no.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.040
Actually, when I go for
something, I go all in.

25:07.160 --> 25:08.320
Is that so?

25:08.440 --> 25:09.600
Yeah, it is.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.280
Well, I shall remember
that, if the time

25:11.400 --> 25:12.960
comes for decisions to be made.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.640
You should.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.640
Because you don't want to get inmy way when I go for something.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.440
Got it.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.760
Good.

25:21.880 --> 25:26.520
But what if, for argument'ssake, I was the thing you

25:26.640 --> 25:27.480
were going for?

25:27.600 --> 25:29.080
What then?

25:29.200 --> 25:30.640
Well, that's not
likely, given you're

25:30.760 --> 25:32.440
the boss's fiance and all.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.000
I wasn't giving
you the go-ahead,

25:34.120 --> 25:37.400
just to be clear on that.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.320
Got it.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.360
Cards.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.680
Sorry?

25:45.800 --> 25:47.160
Another thing
I'm an amazing at--

25:47.280 --> 25:49.520
cards.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.000
Strangely, I am
also amazing at cards.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.640
[music playing]

25:53.760 --> 26:03.920
MAN: [SINGING] Sometimes, Ifeel thrown about on a bad train

26:04.040 --> 26:08.920
or on a rolling boat.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.400
Are you ready?

26:10.520 --> 26:11.520
For what?

26:11.640 --> 26:13.400
To accept your
inevitable defeat.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.800
Veronica didn't lookmuch like a Veronica to me.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.920
Are you trying to distract me?

26:22.040 --> 26:23.600
Maybe.

26:23.720 --> 26:27.920
Veronica is also
known as Ronnie.

26:28.040 --> 26:31.160
He's an arts dealer I use to buyEvan all these beautiful things

26:31.280 --> 26:32.920
that he craves.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.720
He's also as camp as a rubbertent at a Boy Scout jamboree.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.480
I wasn't going to tell him.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.840
But what if I'm lying?

26:39.960 --> 26:41.120
What if I'm having an affair?

26:44.680 --> 26:46.160
Is that why I meant
to keep an eye on you?

26:46.280 --> 26:47.520
No.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.000
It's just a job he gives
to all the young bucks

26:49.120 --> 26:52.680
whenever he goes away, justto remind them I'm his.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.760
Well, what makes you his?

26:54.880 --> 26:58.000
The rock on your finger?

26:58.120 --> 27:01.080
Yeah, it kind of does.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.920
Mind you, without an
actual wedding date

27:03.040 --> 27:06.840
to go with it, where's
the line between fiance

27:06.960 --> 27:09.440
and a mistress with a ring?

27:09.560 --> 27:11.600
Why wouldn't he marry you?

27:11.720 --> 27:13.240
Because Evan gets bored.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.240
Because he likes collectingbeautiful things.

27:15.360 --> 27:18.640
Because his desire tostay eternally young means

27:18.760 --> 27:20.520
a have a "use by" date.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.560
And I am telling
you way too much.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.160
You have far too
much over me now.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.560
So tell me your
deepest, darkest secret.

27:28.680 --> 27:29.440
Now.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.480
I shot a man.

27:36.600 --> 27:37.400
Bullshit.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.080
Did he die?

27:47.200 --> 27:49.000
No.

27:49.120 --> 27:52.080
Did you go to prison?

27:52.200 --> 27:53.320
No.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.240
Why'd you shoot him?

27:58.720 --> 28:00.720
I was protecting someone.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.560
Now we've both got secrets.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.560
[music playing]

29:10.160 --> 29:11.520
Man.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.160
After last night, when Iwas faced with certain death

29:13.280 --> 29:16.120
at the hands of angry Dallies,I thought my life of crime

29:16.240 --> 29:17.680
was over.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.640
If you're so certain,how come you're here today?

29:20.760 --> 29:24.600
Luckily, I was only a cog
in someone else's wheel.

29:24.720 --> 29:25.560
Yep.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.760
That'll do the trick.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.800
It was an honor to
steal her for you--

29:29.920 --> 29:31.280
the tow truck, I mean.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.400
They cause so much
hardship to my people.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.480
So there's some
poetic justice here.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.800
Also, there was this.

29:38.920 --> 29:39.920
BERT: Did you get the car?

29:40.040 --> 29:40.960
Yep.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.000
Did you park it where I asked?

29:43.120 --> 29:44.640
Everything is
as you requested.

29:53.680 --> 29:54.440
You need to go.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.960
He'll be back soon.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.200
What about what
happened last--

29:57.320 --> 30:00.120
[shushes] Nothing
happened last night.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.600
Hey!

30:12.720 --> 30:14.200
Where the fuck you been?

30:14.320 --> 30:15.400
I wait for you all night!

30:15.520 --> 30:16.880
You make me sleep
in my fucking car!

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Oh, for God's sake.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.480
What now?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.520
Don't you take the nameof our lord in vain with me.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.760
Without me, you'd be in jail
right now, Mr. Arsonist.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.240
I'm sure you and my
father have worked out

30:26.360 --> 30:27.440
some sort of punishment for me.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.440
Hey, your father
is a good man.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.320
What do you want?

30:32.440 --> 30:34.720
A business proposition.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.680
I'd ask where
you've been all night,

30:42.800 --> 30:44.440
but I'm pretty sure you
won't tell me the truth.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.360
Evan's house.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.200
So you're still
working for him then?

30:50.320 --> 30:52.440
Far as I know.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.840
Found that safe yet?

30:54.960 --> 30:56.280
Pretty sure it doesn't exist.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.360
It'll be there.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.960
Why?

30:59.080 --> 31:00.320
Because your friend who's neverbeen in the place says so.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.080
She knows her man, all right?

31:02.200 --> 31:03.240
It'll be there somewhere.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.600
Well, I can't
fucking find it, can I?

31:04.720 --> 31:09.160
Don't you speak to
your mother like that.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.600
[sighs]

31:10.720 --> 31:12.320
Is Dad here?

31:12.440 --> 31:14.320
He's at Lefty's,
lucky for you.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.000
And for Christ's sake,
stop winding him up.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.640
Every time you wind him up,I have to calm him back down.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.600
And I don't need the
bloody aggravation.

31:20.720 --> 31:24.440
And stay away from the Dalliestoo, if you can help it.

31:24.560 --> 31:27.080
Yeah, that's going tobe easier said than done.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.960
[doorbell rings]

31:32.000 --> 31:33.240
I thought you had a key.

31:33.360 --> 31:36.800
I thought it might
be safer if I knocked.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.720
Nothing happened.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.000
Be cool.

31:42.120 --> 31:42.880
He's in the office.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.400
I didn't read
anything in the paper

31:51.520 --> 31:53.920
today about a fire anywhere.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.040
There was a complication.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.120
I don't care about
complications.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.360
I just wanted the job done.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.240
It'll cost you 20 thou.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.680
Are you blackmailing me?

32:02.800 --> 32:03.800
Not me.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.560
And they don't see
it as blackmail.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.560
A business proposition.

32:07.680 --> 32:08.480
For me?

32:08.600 --> 32:09.760
I know who you work for.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.080
And we know what Mr. Lace wants.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.880
And he can have it.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.240
He can have building.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.920
Great.You-- you should tell him that!

32:17.040 --> 32:17.840
No!

32:17.960 --> 32:18.720
I tell you!

32:18.840 --> 32:20.120
And you tell him.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.840
There must be reparations.

32:21.960 --> 32:25.120
So they want $20,000
in reparations.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.080
The thing is, they want itin cash and they want it today.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.880
Otherwise, it goes
up to 30 thou.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.320
Those fucking Dally
gangster pricks.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.200
Fine.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.720
If that's what they want.

32:35.840 --> 32:36.840
Saves us burning
down this place.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.040
Uh, no.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.160
They want that too.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.480
[imitates flames]
Lucky my Uncle

32:41.600 --> 32:44.720
Rocky has very good insurance.

32:44.840 --> 32:48.560
It will look like
electrical fault, yes?

32:48.680 --> 32:50.360
Sure.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.280
Makes good business
sense, I suppose.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.160
Mate.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.400
Hey.

33:18.920 --> 33:19.720
Go.

33:19.840 --> 33:20.800
Make it so.

33:20.920 --> 33:21.920
Consider it done.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.760
Hey, good work with
Joanne, by the way.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.960
She told me you battered someperv in the bushes outside.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.000
Yeah.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.520
Yeah, it was nothing.
Really.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.440
Appreciate it.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.320
Thanks.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.320
Do you want my suggestion?

33:43.440 --> 33:44.800
Kick him out.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.440
Oddly tame at his age, solet the little prick learn

33:47.560 --> 33:49.600
about life the hard way,
without Mommy and Daddy

33:49.720 --> 33:50.600
to pick up the pieces.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.120
Oh, it's not going to happen.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.520
Rita's got too much of
a soft spot for the boy.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.920
LEFTY: Are you off, love?

33:56.040 --> 33:57.320
Uh, Jazzercise.

33:57.440 --> 33:58.400
The girls are at my sister's.

33:58.520 --> 33:59.680
You'll have some
peace and quiet.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.440
We're off to the
pub to wash the test.

34:01.560 --> 34:02.840
Well, I won't be
watching the test.

34:02.960 --> 34:03.760
Right.

34:03.880 --> 34:04.920
Well, you have fun, eh?

34:05.040 --> 34:05.840
You too.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.000
I'll try.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.720
That's where you
went wrong, mate.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.160
House full of girls.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.400
Sure, it's loud sometimes,but you always bloody

34:14.520 --> 34:15.680
know where you are with them.

34:20.840 --> 34:21.760
Hey, Riana.

34:21.880 --> 34:22.840
Hey, honey.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.160
Come with me.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.080
Now?

34:25.200 --> 34:26.200
Yeah.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.160
Where?

34:27.280 --> 34:28.320
You'll see.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.520
In this?

34:29.640 --> 34:31.000
Yes, in this.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.120
Why?

34:32.240 --> 34:33.320
Man, you ask a
lot of questions.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.800
Well-- [laughs]
--what about the march?

34:34.920 --> 34:37.040
Do you want to walkaround chanting some more,

34:37.160 --> 34:39.120
or are you game enough to liveoutside the law for a bit?

34:50.960 --> 34:51.840
He's going to kill us.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.680
He's not going to kill us.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.160
He's got the cold,
dead eyes of a killer.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.080
Shut up, Sparky.

34:56.200 --> 34:57.120
You got the reparations?

35:06.640 --> 35:07.920
What's this for?

35:08.040 --> 35:10.280
For you.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.400
You are going to
burn place down, yes?

35:13.520 --> 35:14.280
Is job.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.440
You get paid for job.

35:15.560 --> 35:16.760
What are you,
fucking weirdos who

35:16.880 --> 35:18.080
do this sort of shit for fun?- No.

35:18.200 --> 35:18.960
No.

35:19.080 --> 35:19.880
Exactly.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.320
Is business.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.640
Now I ring your boss,take me out for long lunch

35:23.760 --> 35:25.280
to sign contract.

35:25.400 --> 35:31.160
Fortunately, miles away ata time of unfortunate fire.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.360
I think that's your cue.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.000
Where are we?

35:49.120 --> 35:50.560
Up in the Waitakeres.

35:50.680 --> 35:51.600
Yeah, I know that.

35:51.720 --> 35:52.800
What are we doing here?

35:52.920 --> 35:54.240
Waiting.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.400
For what?

35:55.520 --> 35:57.920
Kickoff time in Christchurch.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.040
You got a watch?

35:59.160 --> 35:59.920
Yeah.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.120
OK.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.640
You're in charge.

36:02.760 --> 36:03.520
Of what?

36:03.640 --> 36:04.400
You'll see.

36:09.040 --> 36:13.600
Have you tried sittingWolf down, talking to him?

36:13.720 --> 36:15.640
Well, it's just a suggestion.

36:15.760 --> 36:16.920
No.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.520
No, that's always
been Rita's territory.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.560
Probably best you
leave it to her then.

36:20.680 --> 36:21.600
Maybe so, Phineas.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.560
Maybe so.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.040
COMMENTATOR [ON TV]: Welcome toLancaster Park in Christchurch

36:26.160 --> 36:28.760
for this first test betweenNew Zealand and South Africa.

36:31.680 --> 36:33.120
It's almost kickoff time.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.000
Cool.

36:34.120 --> 36:35.120
Better get busy then.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.960
You know what's
up the hill there?

37:03.080 --> 37:04.600
No.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.720
The Waiatarua transmissionmast, the one beaming the test

37:06.840 --> 37:08.360
to all the homes
around Auckland.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.320
The cops have it
guarded real well.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.240
I know this because Ichecked it out yesterday.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.520
Do you know my Uncle Tama?

37:14.640 --> 37:16.200
No, I don't know
your Uncle Tama.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.440
He used to work for the powercompany until he got laid off,

37:18.560 --> 37:20.920
after an incident involvinga little copper wire.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.800
But before then, he used tolet me drive around with him

37:23.920 --> 37:25.320
in his truck
sometimes, which is how

37:25.440 --> 37:28.800
I know that all the
power that goes to there

37:28.920 --> 37:30.240
comes through here.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.400
And no power means nogame for the rugby heads.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.440
BERT: Well, they've probablygot backup generators and stuff.

37:34.560 --> 37:38.600
But yeah, for a while, a lotof pissed off rugby heads.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.560
Are you game?

37:39.680 --> 37:40.440
Hell yeah!

37:44.360 --> 37:46.200
This is mindless
vandalism, eh?

37:46.320 --> 37:48.080
But for a good cause.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.160
You think the game's started?

37:51.760 --> 37:52.920
Yep.

37:53.040 --> 37:53.800
Do it.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.240
Yeah!

38:04.360 --> 38:05.760
Woo!

38:05.880 --> 38:09.720
Take that, you rugby heads!

38:09.840 --> 38:11.200
Woo!

38:11.320 --> 38:13.200
[laughs]

38:13.320 --> 38:15.680
[angry chatter]

38:15.800 --> 38:18.680
Is there something
wrong with the set?

38:18.800 --> 38:19.760
Could be.

38:19.880 --> 38:20.640
Or--

38:20.760 --> 38:22.160
No.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.800
No, that is a bridge too far.

38:23.920 --> 38:24.960
What?

38:25.080 --> 38:26.040
If it's those
fucking protesters,

38:26.160 --> 38:28.640
they have gone
too far this time!

38:28.760 --> 38:31.880
You do not mess with a man'sright to watch rugby on TV!

38:32.000 --> 38:32.800
Fuck!

38:37.840 --> 38:39.600
The dashboard
too, just in case.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.240
How did you get to
be so good at this?

38:45.360 --> 38:46.320
I work in a garage.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.600
Uh-huh.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.920
I picked it up watching TV.

38:53.040 --> 38:53.800
Uh-huh.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.360
Is this our getaway car?

39:00.480 --> 39:03.200
Uh, yes.

39:03.320 --> 39:07.080
I don't think I've ever metanyone quite like you, honey.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.080
Probably not.

39:09.200 --> 39:13.840
Do we have to
get away right now?

39:13.960 --> 39:16.600
Probably not.

39:16.720 --> 39:17.520
Good.

39:23.120 --> 39:26.640
Isn't there, um, someprotest march we should be on?

39:26.760 --> 39:28.400
We've done enough
protesting for one day.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.080
What if Dave and
his crew need a hand?

39:33.200 --> 39:35.640
[laughs] I'm sure Dave
can look after himself.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.200
Hey!

39:39.320 --> 39:40.080
Stop!

39:40.200 --> 39:41.160
I-- I said stop!

39:41.280 --> 39:42.640
Oy!

39:42.760 --> 39:45.080
Hey!

39:45.200 --> 39:51.440

39:51.560 --> 39:55.200
You know, I'll be happywhen this bloody tour is over.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.120
Except if our Japie friends
leave without us having

39:57.240 --> 39:58.080
relieved them of their money.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.000

[sirens]

40:01.480 --> 40:02.880
Oh, well.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.120
At least there's alwayssomeone worse off than we are.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.200
Where is Rocky's
fish place from here?

40:22.200 --> 40:23.040
Hey.

40:23.160 --> 40:23.960
Hello.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.360
I found the safe.

40:48.920 --> 40:50.600
I told you it was there.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.680
It's not as if we'reknow how to open it though.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.400
Don't you worry about that?

40:54.520 --> 40:56.400
Are we going to
have to bring Dad in?

40:56.520 --> 40:57.760
No need.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.360
Forget about the
safe for a while.

40:59.480 --> 41:02.120
What you need to worry aboutis, when the job goes down,

41:02.240 --> 41:04.280
it has to be crystal clearto Lace that you had nothing

41:04.400 --> 41:05.720
to do with it.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.840
Well, he's going tosuspect me, whatever we do.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.320
Probably.

41:09.440 --> 41:12.120
But there are others muchcloser to home than you

41:12.240 --> 41:13.400
that he's going
to suspect first.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.520
How?

41:19.640 --> 41:20.560
That's my problem, not yours.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.480
You've done your job, Wolf.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.440

41:37.840 --> 41:38.920
Burned down that factory?

41:39.040 --> 41:40.160
Yeah, so?

41:40.280 --> 41:41.720
Did what happened
last night not sink

41:41.840 --> 41:43.280
into your thick fucking skull?

41:43.400 --> 41:45.040
Yeah, but I don'tthink it sunk into yours.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.200
Wolf, don't be a smart ass.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.200
It was a job.

41:47.320 --> 41:48.800

41:48.920 --> 41:50.160
For your Dally mates!

41:52.440 --> 41:54.120
Because it's just business, Dad!

41:54.240 --> 41:55.880

fucking work these days!

41:56.000 --> 41:58.400
Everybody's up everyone else,and at the end of the day,

41:58.520 --> 41:59.400
I get paid.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.880
What, you want a cut, old man?

42:01.000 --> 42:02.680

42:02.800 --> 42:04.640
You're a bit skint at
the moment, aren't you?

42:04.760 --> 42:06.360

fucking world order!

42:22.240 --> 42:23.040
Look, love, he's learn--

Don't!

42:24.040 --> 42:24.920
OK?

42:25.040 --> 42:28.040
Don't you try and defend him.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.840
He can keep his fucking money.

42:46.640 --> 42:49.280
Oh, so we've gone back tousing the key now, have we?

42:49.400 --> 42:50.480

42:50.600 --> 42:51.960

getting pissed

42:52.080 --> 42:54.640
