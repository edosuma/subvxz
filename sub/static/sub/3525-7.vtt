01:40.400 --> 01:42.850
Don't tell me we fight. I try to get along.

01:42.885 --> 01:45.265
You can't just say
whatever comes to mind.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.100
You were horrible.
That shit about the roadies...

01:48.200 --> 01:51.800
You hit below the belt yourself, Jan,
and you started it.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.900
No cheese for Sophia.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.600
Those kids seem to like you, sort of.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.800
I leave them completely free to do
whatever they want.

02:00.835 --> 02:03.900
How else are they gonna learn
from their mistakes?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.600
Anyway, thank you for having us over.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.100
What's this you're watching?

02:16.135 --> 02:18.100
Beethoven.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.200
- Can we get a dog?
- Please?

02:28.300 --> 02:30.800
I'll walk him,
and I'll pick up the poo and pee.

02:30.835 --> 02:33.800
Pee? Right. Start with your underwear.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.500
We had a dog, remember? Tippy?

02:41.500 --> 02:44.800
He got worms though,
had to move to the country.

02:44.900 --> 02:48.565
Tippy was gassed, Tony.
Daddy took him to the pound.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.000
He used to drag his ass on the carpet
just to scratch himself.

02:52.035 --> 02:55.300
- My mother went crazy.
- Gassed?

02:55.400 --> 02:58.300
And he's so cynical about everything else.

02:58.335 --> 03:01.200
Father told me
he took him to live on a farm.

03:01.300 --> 03:05.500
That's what they always say. That same
farm must have 17 billion dogs on it.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.200
Dogshit up to the rafters.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.965
What? Oh, no, that's terrible.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.700
- What? What's the matter?
- It's Cousin Josephine. Aunt Concett' died.

03:22.735 --> 03:25.800
- What happened?
- They think it was a heart attack.

03:27.700 --> 03:31.500
Uncle Zio found her on the couch
after Meet The Press.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.300
We hereby commend Concetta to the Lord

03:34.335 --> 03:37.200
embraced in His divine goodness.

03:38.200 --> 03:43.100
- Let us go in peace. Amen.
- Amen.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.100
Listen, as long as we're here

03:54.200 --> 03:56.000
I was gonna go visit my father.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.900
Like to join me?

03:58.000 --> 04:02.100
Five hours, they let me out for these funerals.
I gotta spend it bein' maudlin?

04:02.200 --> 04:03.900
It's a beautiful day.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.600
I thought you might wanna pay your respects
to your brother.

04:07.635 --> 04:09.865
By crying to a chunk of marble?

04:09.900 --> 04:13.000
I can pay my respects from the after-party.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.400
After-party?

04:17.500 --> 04:22.200
It's those uptake inhibitors. We were sceptical
at first, then his mood improved.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.300
His memory, too.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.700
Excuse me.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
Excuse me. Hi.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.800
- Oh, hello.
- You knew my mother?

04:59.900 --> 05:02.400
You're Anthony. Oh, my God.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.000
- Do I know you?
- Oh, no.

05:06.100 --> 05:10.600
- No, no, you're not annoying me.
- No, no... Do we know each other?

05:10.700 --> 05:13.465
Oh, we met once.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.300
I was a friend of your father's.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.800
You're the lady from Bamberger's...
from the fur department.

05:24.835 --> 05:27.500
- Fran Felstein.
- Tony.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.000
How you doin'?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.000
So what, you... You come visit?

05:37.400 --> 05:39.600
I miss your father sometimes. It's...

05:39.635 --> 05:41.965
It's foolish.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.365
Nah, don't say that.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.200
No, I was sorry to hear about your mother.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.400
At least she didn't suffer.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.400
She made all of us suffer instead.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.300
Oh, it was a joke. She made all of us suffer.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.200
Believe me,
I heard the stories from your dad.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.100
You must forgive me.
My hearing... the last few years...

06:09.200 --> 06:12.400
How about a hearin' aid?
They're little now. You can't see 'em.

06:12.435 --> 06:16.900
I'm too vain. Anyway...
Johnny was very proud of you.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.800
You were very special to him.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.165
I'm sure you were too.

06:24.200 --> 06:29.200
Johnny told me if I ever needed anything
I should always call his son.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.100
What do you need?

06:35.200 --> 06:36.900
Not a thing.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.865
Fran Felstein?

06:43.900 --> 06:47.200
- That was class.
- She's got great legs for an old broad.

06:47.235 --> 06:49.400
I was in love with that woman.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.900
She was the reason I never married.
I wanted to propose.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.600
- I had the ring all picked out.
- So what? She turned you down?

06:57.635 --> 07:02.200
I hesitated. How could I bring
this life we live on a woman?

07:02.300 --> 07:05.165
Anyway,
she took it as a sign I wasn't interested.

07:05.200 --> 07:11.600
Then one night we were all at the 500 Club
to see Enzo Stuarti. Your father shows up.

07:11.700 --> 07:15.800
Sy Devore suit, two-inch lapel - that was that.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.100
She never knew my feelings. What could I do?

07:21.400 --> 07:23.700
For years, I suffered in silence.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.600
Mario, did you bring your guitar?

07:32.635 --> 07:34.600
Not to this.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.800
- Angie, come on. Sing us a song.
- You sing, Junior.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.700
Nobody wants to hear me.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.800
Mario, remember?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.600
Thanks, my name's JT.
I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

07:58.635 --> 07:59.765
Hi, JT.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.300
I'm also a TV writer which, by default,
makes me a douche bag,

08:03.400 --> 08:06.700
but you would've figured that out
for yourselves.

08:08.600 --> 08:13.000
About 15 years ago,
I moved from Jersey to Hollywood

08:13.035 --> 08:15.600
broke into the biz.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.250
It was a dream come true. I had money,

08:18.285 --> 08:20.765
I had the Beemer, the actress girlfriend.

08:20.800 --> 08:26.200
Best of all, I had all the flake I needed
to keep me churning out that snappy dialogue.

08:26.235 --> 08:31.200
Drugs, alcohol - that shit practically
comes with the Writers' Guild card.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.100
Anyway,

08:34.799 --> 08:37.799
before too long, I discovered heroin.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.600
Then things really started to fall apart.

08:43.700 --> 08:47.700
It got so bad
that I blew a deadline on a Nash Bridges.

08:48.500 --> 08:52.165
I got my ass fired. I didn't work for 18 months.

08:52.200 --> 08:57.200
By the grace of God, I got myself
into a rehab programme in Pennsylvania

08:57.235 --> 09:02.200
and, with the help of some good friends
that I made there, I got through it.

09:03.100 --> 09:07.000
Chris, where are you?
There's my man Chris, everybody.

09:10.400 --> 09:15.200
Anyway, I wanna talk a little bit about
takin' a moral inventory.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.700
So we talked for, like, an hour.

09:17.800 --> 09:23.000
Well, it turns out that they had a thing,
her and my old man. Right up till he died.

09:23.035 --> 09:26.300
He got from this woman
what he couldn't get at home.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.765
Support...

09:29.800 --> 09:31.565
You know, love.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.900
A smile when you walk in the fuckin' door.

09:33.935 --> 09:36.200
Do you think that justifies his infidelity?

09:36.300 --> 09:41.600
She drove him into that woman's arms,
my mother. To all his women.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
I'll tell you one thing.
Over the years he was rottin' in that grave

09:49.800 --> 09:53.000
I can't remember once
my mother goin' to visit him.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
But this lady, Fran...

09:57.100 --> 10:00.065
It's possible your mother found it very painful.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.800
- Oh, poor her.
- What was it like sitting there with Fran?

10:05.500 --> 10:07.500
A little weird at first...

10:09.400 --> 10:13.800
Here I am comforting my father's mistress.
My mother's lyin' there, dead.

10:13.835 --> 10:17.100
- Are you attracted to her?
- She's old enough to be my mother!

10:18.900 --> 10:21.300
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's an expression.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.800
Don't cream yourself.
I did not want to fuck my mother!

10:27.700 --> 10:32.900
You should've seen her in her hairnet.
This conversation'd be over in two seconds.

10:32.935 --> 10:35.800
So, I figured, why not move back to Jersey?

10:35.835 --> 10:38.065
Clean slate. It's better.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.200
My new agent? Next week,
he's got me set up to meet Dick Wolf's guy.

10:42.235 --> 10:44.200
I seen Dick Wolf at Rao's one night.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.300
Guy's got his own limo.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.800
That Law And Order money?
The guy could have his own battleship.

10:50.835 --> 10:54.300
But, enough of my shit. How are you doin'?

10:55.300 --> 10:57.665
Good, you know.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.100
Workin' the programme.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.365
I had some fuckin' wine, all right?
Is that what you wanna hear?

11:10.400 --> 11:15.800
- Christopher, when was this?
- I don't know. My fiancée was in a car crash.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.600
I didn't even like it.
I went to a meeting the next day.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.300
But no slip since then?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.300
I've been sober and I've been high.
Sober's better.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.700
- You know you can call me any time?
- What? You got a date?

11:30.735 --> 11:33.200
I gotta meet somebody, a friend.

11:34.900 --> 11:37.300
- Go ahead, I'll get this.
- Thanks, bro.

11:37.335 --> 11:39.600
Listen, call me. I'm serious.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.100
- Harold Melvoin.
- Mel, it's me.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.100
- Corrado, what's up?
- There's a funeral I need to attend.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.700
I want you to call the feds.

12:11.735 --> 12:13.565
Vincent Patronella.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.565
Is he a relative? You know the rules.

12:16.600 --> 12:21.100
He's my niece's godfather. I think I met him
at a barbecue for the bicentennial.

12:21.135 --> 12:22.700
All they can say is no.

12:29.100 --> 12:34.300
Your father used to bring me flowers
all the time - flowers and lingerie.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.400
I'm making chicken,
Cuban style with black beans.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.000
What's this?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.700
Ketchup? Sure. If you want.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.300
No, the kid and the dog.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.065
My son, Bruce.

12:53.100 --> 12:58.700
He married an Israeli girl.
He's a food service director with El Al.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.800
- No, no, no, the dog.
- Oh, Freckles?

13:03.200 --> 13:06.700
- He was a gift from your dad.
- What?

13:07.900 --> 13:09.500
Aw, when?

13:10.700 --> 13:12.600
Oh, this is my fuckin' dog!

13:15.800 --> 13:20.300
Excuse me, I'm sorry. This was my dog!
His name was Tippy!

13:21.300 --> 13:23.200
Your dad never said.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.100
I don't fuckin' believe this.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.900
My mother made him give the dog away.

13:28.935 --> 13:31.765
Well, Bruce loved him.

13:31.800 --> 13:36.100
He had him for almost ten years,
till he moved to Tel Aviv.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.700
Then I had to put him to sleep.

13:40.900 --> 13:44.100
Those are the pictures, on the coffee table.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.900
The slippers were your dad's, too.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.200
Look at this. The two of you.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.300
He used to remind me of Victor Mature.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.500
Outside the Latin Quarter.

14:13.600 --> 14:19.400
- Holy shit, look at Hesh. George Gershwin.
- He was a whoremaster, and cheap.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.300
He screwed me out of my retirement money.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.765
Against your dad's wishes, by the way.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.100
- What are you talkin' about?
- Don't get me started.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.800
- Come on, what happened?
- Your dad owned a racetrack.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.700
With the midget auto racing.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.000
The Chickamauga Raceway
over in New Egypt.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.900
Him, Herman, some other guy...

14:46.900 --> 14:51.000
- Phil something. With the hair, from New York.
- Leotardo.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.000
My father cut him in to pay off a poker debt.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.600
Johnny always told me
his piece would go to me.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.100
Couldn't put me in his will, obviously.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.400
When he passed, your dad...

15:06.500 --> 15:08.500
I called Hesh.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.400
He sent me 500 bucks.

15:12.435 --> 15:13.700
That's it?

15:15.400 --> 15:17.800
I'm sorry.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.000
Jesus Christ, I wish you'd called me.

15:22.800 --> 15:28.400
- Bruce sends me money occasionally.
- That's not the point. It's my father's wishes.

15:28.435 --> 15:32.500
Look, forget it. Seriously, I'm sorry.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.100
I shouldn't have even brought it up.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.700
Listen, after we eat, you wanna take a ride?

15:43.700 --> 15:47.000
So I saw my Uncle Jun'.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.800
- He says to say hello.
- Junior?

15:50.900 --> 15:53.665
Jesus. How's he doing?

15:53.700 --> 15:57.900
I don't know if you know it,
but he was always a little hot for you.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
He was practically a stalker.

16:00.100 --> 16:03.100
- He said he suffered in silence.
- Suffered in silence?

16:03.200 --> 16:06.365
He used to skulk outside my building, all hours.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.900
Weird phone calls. I always had a hunch
he told Livia about me and Johnny.

16:10.935 --> 16:13.200
Jesus Christ.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.200
She was a handsome woman, your mother.

16:18.100 --> 16:21.700
Not sexy, exactly, but statuesque.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.500
Little nip?

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
- What is it?
- One for the road, honey.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.100
And this looks like road to me.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.100
Rémy Martin, VSOP.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.600
They can't be making much,
but if I know Hesh

16:54.000 --> 16:56.300
him and Phil got something going on here.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.700
So, tell me about your women.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.800
Your wife, what's she like?

17:05.200 --> 17:07.700
I don't know. What's to tell?

17:10.099 --> 17:12.099
Good woman, good mother.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.400
Marriage hit the rocks, that's all.
What are you gonna do?

17:19.400 --> 17:21.000
How about your girlfriend?

17:21.099 --> 17:24.200
She's an art dealer. Very sophisticated.

17:25.300 --> 17:29.100
Dark hair, dark eyes. She's Latin.

17:30.100 --> 17:32.200
You know, from Spain.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
That's it.

17:44.200 --> 17:48.100
Oh, man, I'm so glad you called.
I really needed this.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.165
- So?
- So, what?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.900
There's nothing you wanna talk about?

17:58.935 --> 18:01.600
I was honest with you the other night.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.565
- You're telling me you're not using?
- What?

18:06.600 --> 18:11.700
You ran out of IHOP like you were on fire
and jonesing like a motherfucker.

18:11.735 --> 18:14.700
I was going with a girl to the track.
The Meadowlands.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.600
I didn't wanna miss the last race.

18:16.635 --> 18:19.665
I am totally clean and sober.

18:19.700 --> 18:22.900
Jesus Christ.
I was positive you fucking slipped.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.800
Thank you, man. I appreciate your concern.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.300
I could have saved you a trip.
I'll take your action.

18:34.335 --> 18:38.000
You take a dime each
on the Yankees and St. Louis?

18:38.035 --> 18:40.165
Whoa, high roller.

18:40.200 --> 18:44.800
I just got a three grand residual
on a That's Life episode.

18:44.835 --> 18:48.000
What, that fake guinea-fest with Paul Sorvino?

18:48.035 --> 18:50.200
That was totally unrealistic.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.400
So dusty here.

18:57.800 --> 19:02.200
- That silk?
- It ain't Kleenex. It's linen.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
You know, you're very...

19:07.700 --> 19:09.700
I don't know, you got a lot of class.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.200
Just like your girlfriend.

19:22.200 --> 19:26.000
He told me to look out for her
so I sent her some money. No one else did.

19:26.035 --> 19:28.400
- So you keep his end for yourself?

19:28.500 --> 19:32.100
I should give it to some trollop?
Besides, I thought I had it coming.

19:32.135 --> 19:36.100
With Leotardo in the can,
who's been running that place, huh?

19:36.135 --> 19:38.900
Collecting the rent, filing the taxes, all that?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.200
What about my share?
All those years, I never saw a dime.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.000
You're my father's friend, Hesh. My friend!

19:48.100 --> 19:51.700
- So how come I never see you?
- What?

19:51.800 --> 19:54.700
I see you. I'm fucking busy.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.550
Never too busy to call me at two am
to hear your problems.

19:58.585 --> 20:02.265
One time, that happened.
My therapist was on vacation.

20:02.300 --> 20:07.450
You want his end, kid, you got it. It's
25 per cent. The closing is not for two weeks.

20:07.485 --> 20:12.600
And I would appreciate it if you tell Leotardo
he should assume part of that burden.

20:12.635 --> 20:16.600
Well, despite how you feel,
my father loved this woman.

20:16.700 --> 20:19.800
She's not such a bad person,
but I don't know.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.300
Something about her
always rubbed me the wrong way.

20:23.400 --> 20:28.100
- Maybe cos she was rubbing him and not you.
- How long you know me, bub, huh?

20:28.135 --> 20:30.400
She's a little pale for my taste.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.700
Mr Patronella was last week.
This is a different one.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.600
Yes, I'm aware
he's been to two funerals in a month.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.200
Well, people die, Counselor.

20:49.500 --> 20:52.500
The deceased in question now, Mrs Crilley,

20:52.535 --> 20:55.500
was the sister of Mr Soprano's cousin.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.500
By marriage.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.365
So she's not a blood relative per se.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.200
For God's sake,
the man wants to pay his respects.

21:07.100 --> 21:11.000
Well, perhaps my next call should be
to Judge Runions.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.400
Five hours, it's not a Hawaiian vacation.

21:19.500 --> 21:23.600
He'll attend the church service
then pay his respects to the family.

21:26.100 --> 21:28.800
Thank you, Counselor. We appreciate it.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.500
You're worth every fucking cent!

21:40.100 --> 21:43.200
They're gonna have
Scottish bagpipes at the funeral.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.200
It should be interesting.

21:58.100 --> 22:01.200
Don Provolone. See that fucking game?

22:02.400 --> 22:05.400
- Diet Coke and whatever he's having.
- Ginger ale?

22:07.700 --> 22:11.500
- Remind me to send Jeter a dozen roses.
- You wanna parlay it?

22:11.600 --> 22:15.000
I was thinking I'd check out
that Indian casino, play some poker.

22:15.035 --> 22:17.900
You want in a real game, I'll hook you up.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.600
High stakes, exclusive clientele.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.365
- David Lee Roth.
- I'll tell you, man.

22:25.400 --> 22:29.000
Playing cards, games of chance,
I never really dug it before.

22:29.100 --> 22:35.500
I was never that good at math. But there's
something about that excitement that's so...

22:35.600 --> 22:37.600
I don't know.

22:38.700 --> 22:41.800
What is wrong? I win a bet,
you look like you're gonna cry.

22:41.835 --> 22:44.100
I fucked up again.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.700
My super came by this morning
to fucking caulk around the toilet.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.700
- He had some weed.
- You have got to call someone

22:52.800 --> 22:54.800
before you use, not after.

22:54.900 --> 22:59.200
I know, I know. I just wanted to see
if I could get high like a normal person.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.800
You're not normal. Neither of us are.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.600
On top of that,
you ask me to meet you at a bar?

23:09.300 --> 23:11.900
Come here, you maniac.

23:12.400 --> 23:17.165
625K for the track plus all that land? That's it?

23:17.200 --> 23:20.300
Zoning restrictions.
We're lucky we got a buyer at all.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.100
Here's what I propose...

23:24.100 --> 23:26.300
Tony gets 150.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.300
25 per cent comes from you,
the other 75 per cent of that comes from Hesh.

23:30.400 --> 23:34.000
That's 40 grand.
You gotta be fucking kidding me, John.

23:34.100 --> 23:35.600
Am I smiling?

23:39.200 --> 23:41.550
You got some balls, kid, I'll give you that.

23:41.585 --> 23:43.900
- You'll give me what I tell you to.
- Whoa.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.365
- Take it easy.
- Fuck that!

23:46.400 --> 23:48.965
This ain't the '70s. And I'm not a kid.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.700
- Relax, it's an expression.
- Here's another one.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.000
You got five days to give me my money.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.800
Come on.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.300
- That was out of line.
- Philly, he's a boss.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.700
Jersey? Come on, huh?

24:15.100 --> 24:18.100
Well, I talked to Phil and Hesh
about the racetrack.

24:18.135 --> 24:20.365
How bad did they bullshit you?

24:20.400 --> 24:22.765
Actually, we straightened it all out.

24:22.800 --> 24:26.600
So when the sale goes through,
you're looking at a nice piece of change.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.465
You're kidding?

24:28.500 --> 24:31.100
Hey, that's wonderful.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.200
I wanted to show you something.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.500
You were admiring my handkerchief.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.600
Check out the initials.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.600
JFK? Holy shit! This was his?

24:58.800 --> 25:01.800
You know, I have a hat of his.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.300
A captain's hat I bought at an auction.

25:04.400 --> 25:08.100
A lot of the friends don't like him,
you know, Ruby and all that shit.

25:08.200 --> 25:12.300
- But, fuck, I was in grammar school.
- That's my lipstick.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.900
We had a little thing.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.200
- When he was president?
- March '61.

25:19.235 --> 25:21.765
Right before the Bay of Pigs.

25:21.800 --> 25:24.365
I was at the Copa with a girlfriend.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.665
I'm wearing a new sable
and we meet Lem Billings.

25:27.700 --> 25:32.200
Now, Lem is a school friend of Jack's
from Choate, but of course we had no idea.

25:32.235 --> 25:37.000
He insists that we join him
for some affair at the Pierre Hotel.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.000
He won't take no.

25:40.100 --> 25:44.200
He has a limo, we figure, "What the hell?"

25:44.300 --> 25:47.100
We go over and he tells us

25:47.200 --> 25:49.400
he's taking us to the presidential suite.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.865
So we get up, out of the elevator.

25:52.900 --> 25:58.500
We go in the suite.
It is crawling with models, celebrities.

25:58.535 --> 26:00.900
Peter Lawford, Sinatra.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
- Jackie Gleason.
- No shit!

26:04.100 --> 26:07.200
I'm looking around
and I glance across the room

26:07.300 --> 26:11.050
and, suddenly, I am locking eyes

26:11.085 --> 26:14.800
with John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.500
Yeah, he comes over.
He is a perfect gentleman.

26:19.600 --> 26:23.900
He takes my coat,
he brings me a cocktail, introduces me around.

26:23.935 --> 26:26.200
Finally, at the end of the night, and get this.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.200
In the interests of national security, he says

26:29.300 --> 26:31.565
he needs me to stay.

26:31.600 --> 26:35.100
Since I'm wearing a sable,
he needs to personally interview me.

26:35.135 --> 26:38.400
Make sure I'm not working for the Russians.

26:38.435 --> 26:41.500
- He said that?
- Some line, huh?

26:43.600 --> 26:46.300
- What was he like?
- Wonderful.

26:46.400 --> 26:49.365
- So were you two an item?
- No. He called.

26:49.400 --> 26:54.000
But after all, this man was the leader
of the free world. I mean, you know...

26:54.100 --> 26:58.600
One weekend, I was supposed
to go down to DC, stay at the Ritz-Carlton.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.965
Last minute, emergency meeting.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.900
- Steel workers are going on strike.
- So it was just that one time?

27:08.400 --> 27:12.100
You know, after the Bay of Pigs,
he was probably pretty busy.

27:12.135 --> 27:14.365
Yeah, I knew there were others.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.965
Judy Campbell and Marilyn, of course.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.550
We had something special, though.
Crazy passion.

27:20.585 --> 27:24.100
That was something
your mother never understood.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.565
When you're married to a powerful man

27:27.600 --> 27:31.000
you damn well better make him feel powerful.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.350
My mother?

27:34.385 --> 27:36.465
Please.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.200
I saw a picture of Livia on New Year's Eve.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.900
She was dressed like a refugee.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.400
I think I'm going to skip the coffee.
I got a meeting in the city.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.600
Are you sure?

27:55.200 --> 27:57.200
Look...

27:59.200 --> 28:01.065
Consider this an advance.

28:01.100 --> 28:03.900
Get your phone turned on
and pay your rent.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Your dad would be so proud.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.300
He raised a real gentleman.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.000
You trying to buy this pot?

28:22.100 --> 28:24.500
800 and you'll know.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
What the fuck.

28:30.700 --> 28:33.100
Cowboys and three little Indians.

28:34.100 --> 28:36.100
Fuck me!

28:40.100 --> 28:42.900
I got a lot of big people
coming next week.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.200
So when you write on TV, what do they have -

28:47.300 --> 28:50.200
like one guy writes the words
for Dylan McDermott

28:50.235 --> 28:53.100
and one guy writes
for Nicholson's girlfriend?

28:54.200 --> 28:57.800
- You write it all yourself.
- Oh, interesting.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.400
So how you doing? You wanna take off?

29:02.435 --> 29:04.665
I'm getting killed here.

29:04.700 --> 29:06.700
I'm gonna go. I'm fucking shot.

29:06.800 --> 29:11.100
- I'll call you tomorrow. You wanna work out?
- Sure, yeah, whatever.

29:11.135 --> 29:14.900
Four of clubs to Joe Hollywood,
jack for the car-wash king.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.200
Ten for Mr Vito.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.700
Show Valentina you love her!

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
They were out of the Citrucel.

29:59.300 --> 30:03.300
- Where are you going?
- Gotta order some flowers.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.800
Sal from the dry-cleaner, his kid died.

30:05.900 --> 30:09.100
Drowned in a Jacuzzi.
Seven years old, you believe it?

30:09.135 --> 30:11.100
Fucking tragedy.

30:22.600 --> 30:27.700
- Harold Melvoin.
- It's me. I got another funeral. A kid.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.965
His father does my shirts.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.600
- It has to be a relative.
- It is a relative, goddamn it!

30:33.700 --> 30:36.700
My old man came over
with his great-great-grandfather.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.700
- Guy had a club foot.
- Isn't that rather tenuous?

30:39.800 --> 30:44.000
The whole village of Avellino
settled in this area. We gotta be related.

30:44.035 --> 30:46.200
- Corrado...
- Corrado, my balls!

30:46.300 --> 30:49.100
I've gotta get out of here.
I'm going stir-crazy.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
7th Street coming out.

30:58.100 --> 31:00.500
Holy shit. You're still here?

31:01.500 --> 31:04.200
- Called you all day.
- We're in a hand here.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.600
- What do you wanna do?
- Fold.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.900
Here, fuck it. I'm all in.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.400
- Call.
- Pair of tens.

31:20.300 --> 31:22.600
Flush. Caught it on the river.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.000
Motherfucking...

31:25.100 --> 31:27.100
fuck!

31:30.600 --> 31:32.565
How bad?

31:32.600 --> 31:35.500
- He owes the house 57.
- Thousand?

31:44.300 --> 31:47.800
- What are you? Fucking crazy?
- Define crazy.

31:49.600 --> 31:54.100
I'm good for it. I'm up for this Dick Wolf thing.
If I get on staff, it's a month's salary.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.200
Well, how about this fucking month?

31:58.700 --> 32:01.000
You think you could spot me for a while?

32:01.100 --> 32:03.200
I got some child support, too.

32:07.100 --> 32:12.000
I'll cover this, give you three grand
for incidentals. That's 60,000 altogether.

32:12.100 --> 32:16.500
- I've only been up two days. I can still add.
- Good. Then add two points every week

32:16.600 --> 32:20.165
- till I'm paid in full.
- You're charging me vig?

32:20.200 --> 32:25.500
On top of the principal. It's compounded if
you're late. That's 1200 one week from today.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.700
Don't give me that look.
This is your problem.

32:28.735 --> 32:31.000
I will not fucking enable you.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.300
There he is! Philly!

32:54.800 --> 32:58.300
- Phil, where you going?
- I gotta meet John at the restaurant.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.200
You fucking cocksucker!

33:35.600 --> 33:39.200
Where you gonna go, huh?
Where you gonna go?

33:39.300 --> 33:41.200
Motherfucker!

33:52.300 --> 33:54.500
Jesus Christ. Mister, you OK in there?

33:54.600 --> 33:57.300
- Oh, my neck!
- You all right?

33:57.335 --> 34:00.000
You run from me, you cocksucker?

34:00.035 --> 34:02.365
Where's my fucking money?

34:02.400 --> 34:04.900
I'll get it. I'll get it. My neck, Tony.

34:04.935 --> 34:07.667
- What? Do you think I'm an asshole?
- No.

34:07.702 --> 34:10.400
- I can't hear you.
- No, no. Please, Tony.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
You got 24 hours.

34:17.699 --> 34:20.300
I called 911. They're on their way.
He's all right.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.400
Oh, my God.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.000
- Oh, my baby.
- Take her upstairs, Andy.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.264
My baby...

34:33.300 --> 34:37.699
She should take one of those
tranquillizers her mother gave her.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.400
- We should go.
- Relax, we just got here.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.699
Chicken's nice and spicy, huh?

35:11.000 --> 35:15.100
I know you're in there.
You're casting a shadow over the peephole.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.300
What? Are you ducking me?

35:23.900 --> 35:27.000
I thought you were this girl.
She's a pain in the ass.

35:27.100 --> 35:29.965
What the fuck? Where you been?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.365
Working, man. I got those TV pitch meetings.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.400
- I was gonna call you.
- Yeah, so why didn't you?

35:40.800 --> 35:44.700
All right, look. You want the truth?
I was away. I went to AC.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.400
- Where's my money?
- I don't have it yet.

35:47.435 --> 35:48.900
But you went to AC.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.300
I have a meeting next week with Rene Balcer.

35:54.100 --> 35:59.500
Dick Wolf's right-hand guy. He likes my stuff.
He told my agent. I'm gonna be on staff.

35:59.535 --> 36:03.167
I got out of that business
cos people fuck you over.

36:03.202 --> 36:06.701
Jon Favreau?
Faggot cocksucker tried to steal my ideas.

36:06.736 --> 36:10.165
I swear on all that's holy.
I'll have your money next week.

36:10.200 --> 36:14.200
That wasn't the deal! I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't make me a jerkoff.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.100
Damn, I'm happy. Get a load of these.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.200
My new kicks. Bottega Veneta,
marked down to only 600.

36:28.400 --> 36:33.200
- Thought you were paying your phone bill.
- Oh, I should've, I know.

36:33.235 --> 36:37.500
But it's been so long
since I've been able to treat myself.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.900
Oh, thanks.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.400
So, turns out my Uncle Zio's going downhill.

36:49.500 --> 36:54.900
The day we met, I told you we were at the
cemetery to bury his wife, my Aunt Concetta.

36:55.700 --> 36:57.700
70 years, they were together.

36:59.100 --> 37:01.100
Poor guy's taking it very hard.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.600
Oh! My knight in shining armour!

37:20.400 --> 37:23.100
So?

37:24.800 --> 37:26.800
- Good morning to you, too.
- You got it?

37:26.900 --> 37:30.300
Jesus, you are a fucking trip.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.300
I'm JT by the way.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.200
What is this? Pulp Fiction?
Am I supposed to be afraid?

37:36.235 --> 37:37.900
I don't know. I didn't see it.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
You're really being a prick.
I told you, I need more time.

37:41.100 --> 37:42.965
- I don't have the money.
- Get it.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.700
You know me. What could you do to me
that I haven't already been through?

37:47.800 --> 37:50.400
I'm positive we'll think of something.

38:05.200 --> 38:10.900
And 66 years after taking those sacred vows,
"till death do us part",

38:11.000 --> 38:13.400
Concetta left him and went home to God.

38:14.400 --> 38:18.600
In the two weeks that followed,
Nicolo struggled without her,

38:18.635 --> 38:21.200
finally succumbing to irredeemable loss.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.200
The enormity of his grief

38:26.000 --> 38:28.565
can hardly be imagined.

38:28.600 --> 38:32.100
How much they went through together -

38:32.135 --> 38:35.165
seeing their children grow

38:35.200 --> 38:40.200
and looking joyfully on
as their grandchildren had children.

38:40.300 --> 38:43.200
Sickness and health,

38:43.300 --> 38:45.265
good times and bad

38:45.300 --> 38:48.400
but through it all, one thing remained constant.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.900
They had each other.

38:51.400 --> 38:55.400
It was Nicolo's love for Concetta
that made him leave this earth

38:55.435 --> 38:58.700
a mere 15 days after she left him.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.100
We take comfort
knowing they're together again,

39:02.200 --> 39:04.200
seated at the foot of our Lord.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.600
Let us join together in prayer.

39:08.635 --> 39:10.917
Hail, Mary, full of Grace,

39:10.952 --> 39:13.200
the Lord is with Thee.

39:13.300 --> 39:15.265
Blessed art Thou among women

39:15.300 --> 39:18.500
and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.200
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

39:21.300 --> 39:23.100
pray for us sinners,

39:23.200 --> 39:26.100
now and at the hour of our death, amen.

39:28.100 --> 39:32.000
- Junior, what's the matter?
- Oh, this fucking shit!

39:32.035 --> 39:34.000
What's the point?

39:34.100 --> 39:36.700
- Shh, Uncle Junior.
- I can't take it any more!

39:38.800 --> 39:41.200
You need to lower your voice. Come on.

39:42.700 --> 39:45.000
And forgive us our trespasses

39:45.100 --> 39:49.000
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

39:49.035 --> 39:51.267
It's a fucking Emmy.

39:51.302 --> 39:53.500
It's gold-plated.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.900
Then melt it down, man.

39:56.935 --> 39:59.167
Look, I told you $15.

39:59.202 --> 40:01.365
Fuck, man, come on!

40:01.400 --> 40:03.900
This is like, huge, this shit.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.600
If you had an Oscar,
maybe I could give you something.

40:07.635 --> 40:09.800
An Academy Award. But TV?

40:11.500 --> 40:13.900
- What else you got?
- I don't know.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.800
I got a laptop in my car.

40:16.900 --> 40:19.500
Yeah, OK, cool. I'll check that out.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.200
From your friend. All 1200.

40:39.600 --> 40:43.600
- He gave you a hard time?
- Hardest thing was keeping him awake.

40:43.700 --> 40:48.200
- He's hitting the vein. Nodding out.
- Son of a fucking bitch.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.200
Cheers.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.700
I'm grilling us some filet mignon.

41:00.800 --> 41:03.400
And you, take a load off.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.500
This is the money
from the closing of the racetrack.

41:14.535 --> 41:16.800
- It's 150 grand.
- That's great.

41:18.500 --> 41:21.400
- How's your pal, Hesh?
- Good.

41:21.500 --> 41:25.700
I remember once,
your dad and I drove down the shore.

41:25.800 --> 41:30.300
Hesh had rented a place at Point Pleasant.
It was right before Labor Day.

41:30.400 --> 41:34.800
Actually, it was a couple of months
before he died. We stopped at a liquor store.

41:34.835 --> 41:37.265
He had to pee, I needed some cigarettes.

41:37.300 --> 41:40.500
And anyway,
the man behind the counter was blind.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.600
- Your dad looks at him...
- Wait a minute.

41:45.100 --> 41:48.565
- This is after my dad got sick?
- Yeah.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.900
My dad caught emphysema
and you kept smoking?

41:51.935 --> 41:55.165
- He didn't mind.
- He could barely breathe.

41:55.200 --> 41:59.500
We had the oxygen tent set up right
in the house. Jesus, even my mother quit.

41:59.600 --> 42:04.600
I offered to stop. He didn't want me to.
He was fine with it, really.

42:06.100 --> 42:09.265
All right, whatever. Finish your story.

42:09.300 --> 42:13.400
It was dumb. Your dad got the guy
to give us some champagne.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.850
Water chestnuts

42:26.885 --> 42:29.000
wrapped in bacon.

42:29.100 --> 42:32.200
And dip them in the duck sauce.

42:32.235 --> 42:34.200
All right.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.200
Delicious.

42:44.900 --> 42:47.100
So, what's in the bag?

42:49.300 --> 42:51.600
Yeah, I wanted to show you this.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
It's the hat I told you about.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.200
- JFK's.
- Oh, my goodness.

43:01.300 --> 43:03.400
Look at this.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
- May I?
- Yeah

44:00.600 --> 44:03.450
I met with the Dick Wolf guy.

44:03.485 --> 44:06.300
They hired some kid from Yale.

44:06.400 --> 44:09.400
Plus, now the money I owe you

44:10.800 --> 44:13.000
my ex-fucking-wife...

44:13.100 --> 44:15.100
How many times have you shot up?

44:16.200 --> 44:18.400
Five, six.

44:19.400 --> 44:22.600
I thought I had it under control. I lost it.

44:22.635 --> 44:24.300
You stupid fuck.

44:24.400 --> 44:28.400
- You were doing so good. Now you fucked up.
- Where do you get the right?

44:28.500 --> 44:32.400
We're in the programme.
Why didn't you call your sponsor?

44:32.500 --> 44:35.400
- I couldn't get him.
- So why didn't you call me?

44:41.800 --> 44:45.300
Yeah, but I don't fucking live with my mistress.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.800
I mean, his fucking slippers?

44:50.200 --> 44:52.700
Go on.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.800
Well, when I left there, I...

44:56.600 --> 44:58.300
started thinking about it.

45:01.500 --> 45:05.000
When I was, I don't know, 16 years old -

45:07.500 --> 45:09.300
my son's age -

45:09.400 --> 45:12.800
I came home from school
to find a note from my Aunt Quin.

45:14.900 --> 45:19.800
My mother had been pregnant
with another kid after my sister Barbara.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.700
Change-of-life baby, they called it and...

45:25.500 --> 45:27.100
Well, she started bleeding.

45:28.900 --> 45:31.900
I was supposed get my father
over there ASAP.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.500
I called every number I had.
I left messages all over town.

45:40.100 --> 45:42.900
And finally, that night, about ten o'clock,

45:42.935 --> 45:45.100
he called me back.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.400
- Hello?
- Anthony, what's the matter?

45:53.435 --> 45:55.265
Ma's in the hospital.

45:55.300 --> 45:58.800
I think she was bleeding. The baby.

45:59.400 --> 46:01.300
Jesus Christ.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.900
Oh, shit!

46:08.600 --> 46:11.900
- OK, pal.
- The lamb chops are gonna be overcooked.

46:14.200 --> 46:18.200
I'm tied up, but I'm gonna get over
to the hospital right away.

46:19.300 --> 46:21.100
He came and got me the next morning.

46:23.600 --> 46:26.400
We went over to the hospital,

46:26.435 --> 46:27.965
walked into her room.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.700
- You're OK, baby, you're OK.
- No, you're OK!

46:31.735 --> 46:34.700
Your life is just so wonderful and OK!

46:34.800 --> 46:36.800
Lee...

46:38.900 --> 46:40.900
Where were you last night?

46:43.300 --> 46:45.700
I was at the Yankee game.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.765
You were with that whore.

46:47.800 --> 46:52.500
- What do you take me for? An idiot?
- No, Lee, that's not true!

46:52.535 --> 46:55.567
I picked up Anthony from school,
we went to the game!

46:55.602 --> 46:58.600
- Nicky gave us the tickets.
- You're a goddam liar.

46:58.700 --> 47:01.765
I swear to God, Lee, the car broke down!

47:01.800 --> 47:05.100
The timing belt!
We had to stay at Cousin Jimmy's.

47:06.100 --> 47:11.400
Madonn', when we got home
and saw that note, I was worried sick.

47:11.435 --> 47:13.600
Ask Anthony, you don't believe me.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Where were you last night, Anthony?

47:25.900 --> 47:27.600
We were at Cousin Jimmy's, Ma.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.200
She could've fucking died

47:34.235 --> 47:36.400
from a miscarriage.

47:49.900 --> 47:54.000
- Fuck her.
- Was there any blame on his part?

47:54.100 --> 47:57.000
This man you emulate?

47:57.100 --> 48:00.800
The lies? The betrayals with other women?

48:05.200 --> 48:07.200
Listen to me.

48:07.300 --> 48:12.000
This is very important. Your mother
had her faults, but after all this time

48:12.100 --> 48:14.600
what should we do with the old woman?

48:14.635 --> 48:16.867
Have an auto-da-fé?

48:16.902 --> 48:19.100
Burn her at the stake?

48:21.800 --> 48:24.900
You need to forgive her and move on.

48:32.800 --> 48:34.765
She made my father give my dog away.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.100
I thought your father was a big, tough guy.

48:37.200 --> 48:40.300
Probably didn't want to hear her bullshit
any more.

48:41.800 --> 48:44.600
He gave my dog away
to his girlfriend's kid. Big deal.

48:44.700 --> 48:47.100
If it was up to her,

48:47.200 --> 48:49.600
she woulda had it killed.

49:01.700 --> 49:03.700
All right, thanks.

49:05.400 --> 49:09.500
Book value's 17 grand.
I'll knock that off the principal.

49:12.500 --> 49:15.000
I fucking loved this car.

49:15.100 --> 49:17.600
So you'll get another one.

49:23.800 --> 49:25.800
Is that your sponsor?

49:28.400 --> 49:33.000
I'll see you when you get out of rehab.
We'll figure out the rest of the payments.

49:34.100 --> 49:36.800
You can do this, man. I have faith in you.

49:39.300 --> 49:43.100
There's no chemical solution
to a spiritual problem.

50:02.400 --> 50:06.000
It could've been another TIA. It's hard to tell.

50:06.035 --> 50:09.600
Was any of this
accompanied by a lapse in memory?

50:12.000 --> 50:13.665
I don't know.

50:13.700 --> 50:16.600
Had you brought him earlier
I might have more answers.

50:16.700 --> 50:19.250
That medicine stopped working.

50:19.285 --> 50:21.800
I took more and it didn't do shit.

50:21.900 --> 50:24.600
- I'm the walking dead.
- Medication's like cooking.

50:24.635 --> 50:27.000
We may need to adjust the ingredients.

50:27.100 --> 50:29.200
Who gives a shit? I'm so fucking blue.

50:30.900 --> 50:35.100
What do you expect?
All you do is go to funerals all the time.

50:36.600 --> 50:39.400
I'm trapped. What's the goddamn point?

50:40.300 --> 50:42.600
Goddamn house arrest.

50:46.300 --> 50:48.900
My life is only death.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.100
I'm living in a grave.

50:52.700 --> 50:55.300
I beat prison and for what?

50:55.400 --> 50:57.400
I have no children.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.500
Would somebody please explain this?

51:09.200 --> 51:13.100
So, Hesh tells me you met your dad's goomah.

51:20.300 --> 51:22.200
You had to see this woman in her prime.

51:24.100 --> 51:26.365
- Nice, huh?
- Nice?

51:26.400 --> 51:30.965
- She was JFK's girlfriend for three years.
- No shit!

51:31.000 --> 51:35.200
- I remember hearing about her.
- Fucking knockout. Beautiful, classy.

51:36.100 --> 51:39.500
JFK, huh? How do you like that?

51:41.600 --> 51:45.600
He had her up to the White House
on the weekends, when his wife was away.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.100
This woman was like a... like a princess.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.400
I'll tell you what.

52:00.500 --> 52:05.000
For a while there, Jackie Kennedy
thought the marriage was over.
