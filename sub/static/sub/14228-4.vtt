00:07.322 --> 00:09.457
[Bill] <i>Previously on "Roadies"...</i>

00:09.458 --> 00:10.476
New set lists.

00:10.512 --> 00:11.777
We're gonna open with "Janine" tonight.

00:11.778 --> 00:14.147
Just tell me why did we start
changing the set list?

00:14.182 --> 00:15.882
We should have never started
playing "Janine."

00:15.917 --> 00:17.784
I actually really appreciate
your brutal honesty.

00:17.819 --> 00:19.686
I would very much like it if you'd stay.

00:19.721 --> 00:21.754
Times like these, I used
to like a little drink.

00:21.790 --> 00:23.389
Remember that time at the tiki bar

00:23.425 --> 00:24.691
where you took that torch...

00:24.726 --> 00:26.192
I'm not that guy anymore.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.695
"Bassist Rick Bayless
was clearly inebriated

00:28.730 --> 00:30.063
by the end of the evening."

00:30.098 --> 00:31.531
You go after Rick, you go after me.

00:31.566 --> 00:33.466
I'm sorry, Natalie.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.268
We had to get a restraining
order on your visits.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.437
And here I was thinking foolishly

00:37.472 --> 00:38.992
that we had the makings of some sort of

00:39.007 --> 00:40.440
friendsh... friendship.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.308
You don't want to be my friend anyway.

00:42.344 --> 00:44.877
You two are in denial...

00:44.913 --> 00:47.614
about a lot of things.

00:47.649 --> 00:50.650
[cheers and applause]

00:54.789 --> 00:57.557
Hey.

00:57.592 --> 00:59.626
Hey, you have... wait, what's your name?

00:59.661 --> 01:01.094
It's Kelly Ann. Are you okay?

01:01.129 --> 01:03.429
Now I need you to put the word "oxygen"

01:03.465 --> 01:05.298
on your thing, this thing, okay?

01:05.333 --> 01:07.467
The teleprompter, before
we play "Janine,"

01:07.502 --> 01:09.969
because I need oxygen to
sing that fucking song,

01:10.005 --> 01:11.771
'cause she fucking broke his heart.

01:11.806 --> 01:13.172
Yeah, I'll remind you,
man. I'll remind you, Rick.

01:13.208 --> 01:14.807
It's all right. It's all right.

01:14.843 --> 01:16.609
No, we should have never
started playing that song

01:16.645 --> 01:18.077
because... you know,
'cause Christopher's my friend

01:18.113 --> 01:19.946
and she fucking
broke his heart, you know?

01:19.981 --> 01:22.248
Did you know that he hasn't
said her name in seven years?

01:22.283 --> 01:23.783
Did you know that, Marianne?

01:23.818 --> 01:25.151
- Seven years.
- Hey, it's Kelly Ann, Rick.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.285
- Kelly Ann.
- That's what I said.

01:26.321 --> 01:27.654
[Rick] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:27.689 --> 01:29.789
Would you do that thing that you do

01:29.824 --> 01:31.658
when you just make them disappear?

01:31.693 --> 01:33.533
- [woman] I love you, Rick!
- Uh, yeah. Gotcha.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.361
- Just backstage, dressing room.
- You're the best, man.

01:35.397 --> 01:38.431
- All right, yeah, you got it.
- There he is!

01:38.466 --> 01:40.833
[Milo] Hey, how's it going?

01:40.869 --> 01:42.669
Yeah, Rick, uh, he wanted you to know

01:42.704 --> 01:45.171
that he really enjoyed
hanging with you today,

01:45.206 --> 01:46.472
but, uh... [clicks tongue]

01:46.508 --> 01:48.174
we gotta hit the road, so...

01:48.209 --> 01:50.009
Did you like the, uh, like the show?

01:50.045 --> 01:52.845

Ugh, that smell you are smelling is me.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.324
Ugh, it's me. I reek.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.293
It's actually me.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.362
I have such a great day off planned.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.130
- Me too.
- You both do?

02:11.166 --> 02:13.299
Well, I've always wanted
to see Cave Hill cemetery,

02:13.334 --> 02:15.001
but I can't get anyone to go with me.

02:15.036 --> 02:18.304
And Bill actually suggested
we go together.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.007
I can't wait. I fucking love a cemetery.

02:21.042 --> 02:24.343
[Donna] Me and West
Coast are hitting Hammerheads

02:24.379 --> 02:27.346
- for duck fat fries.
- [Shelli] Mmm.

02:27.382 --> 02:29.716
How does that sound, Kelly Ann?

02:29.751 --> 02:33.986
It sounds... wait, what do you mean?

02:34.022 --> 02:36.389
[Shelli] Uh, I'm gonna
take a long-ass shower.

02:36.424 --> 02:39.525
The minute we check in tomorrow,
I'm gonna order an omelet

02:39.561 --> 02:41.494
with, uh, bacon and onions

02:41.529 --> 02:44.397
and maybe a... a scone if they have one.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.032
[phone ringing]

02:46.067 --> 02:48.668
Hey.

02:48.703 --> 02:50.503
[Kelly Ann] Shelli...

02:50.538 --> 02:53.406
- is Rick okay?
- What?

02:53.441 --> 02:55.675
Never mind. The cemetery sounds...

02:55.710 --> 02:58.177
- I know.
- amazing.

02:58.213 --> 03:00.747
Colonel Sanders buried there.

03:00.782 --> 03:02.882
Really kinda like a technical advisor

03:02.917 --> 03:05.017

03:05.053 --> 03:08.354

lots of slashes in my title.

03:08.389 --> 03:12.959
Oh, and tomorrow, there
happens to be a day off

03:12.994 --> 03:14.994
as fate would have it.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.069
Cool. That's Bill.

03:23.104 --> 03:25.271
He's a great guy, yeah.

03:26.841 --> 03:28.274
- Gooch...
- Mm.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.409
You said you needed your
per diem tonight.

03:30.445 --> 03:31.577
Who's the man?

03:31.613 --> 03:33.412
Oh, no, you the man. Thanks, bro.

03:33.448 --> 03:35.081
Mm.

03:35.116 --> 03:36.983
You think maybe I could get an advance?

03:37.018 --> 03:38.885
'Cause I have to send my
old lady some more money.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.586
- Again?
- Yeah, well, you know,

03:40.622 --> 03:44.123
so got this cousin who
needs something reconstructed.

03:44.159 --> 03:45.625
You seen pictures of my old lady?

03:45.660 --> 03:47.160
- No.
- Right there, check it out.

03:47.195 --> 03:48.961
Right... this your wife?

03:48.997 --> 03:50.963
- That's my wife.
- This is your wife?

03:50.999 --> 03:52.799
That's my wife, Sandy, bro.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.767
Whoa-ho-ho!

03:54.803 --> 03:56.102
- My man.
- Huh?

03:56.137 --> 03:57.804
- Put it down.
- Oh, my bad, sorry.

03:57.839 --> 03:59.839
Yeah, I'm gonna meet up with
her tomorrow in Louisville.

03:59.874 --> 04:01.841
- I can't wait.
- I can see why.

04:01.876 --> 04:03.743
Yeah, especially
since my last few days off,

04:03.778 --> 04:05.645
she had to cancel on
me at the last minute.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.079
Mm.

04:07.115 --> 04:08.614
But I'll be seeing
her tomorrow, God willing.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.449
- [chuckles]
- That's right.

04:10.485 --> 04:12.165
[Wes] <i>Dude, I've
been telling you all week</i>

04:12.187 --> 04:15.254
if we just flip 250 and
251's wheels to the back,

04:15.290 --> 04:16.422
RH 6 will snuggle right in there.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.857
Okay.

04:17.892 --> 04:19.759
What? Why aren't you arguing with me?

04:19.793 --> 04:22.028
It's Rick. I let him down today.

04:22.063 --> 04:24.263
His rhythm got all fucked.

04:24.299 --> 04:25.932
This band... if you
take away the bass...

04:25.967 --> 04:27.466
Yeah, he was having
trouble finding the tempo.

04:27.502 --> 04:29.802
He's having trouble finding
the stage, dude.

04:29.838 --> 04:31.304
All right, get a good piece.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.972
Oh.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.841
God, he just lives for
that moment on stage

04:34.876 --> 04:36.716
- where the hops...
- Meets the grapes, I know.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.511
Meets the grapes, right, yeah.

04:38.546 --> 04:42.615
So, you know, "Beer before
wine, everything's fine," right?

04:42.650 --> 04:45.518
But last week, he asked
me for a Glenfiddich,

04:45.553 --> 04:48.120
so I'm like, I don't
know, "Wine before scotch,

04:48.156 --> 04:49.488
not on my watch."

04:49.524 --> 04:52.191
So I gave it to him after the wine,

04:52.227 --> 04:53.559
during Christopher's second solo,

04:53.595 --> 04:57.230
but now he's on the Lunesta, man.

04:57.265 --> 04:58.898
Nothing rhymes with Lunesta.

08:31.279 --> 08:34.013
Yeah, enough. So, you
may well be wondering...

08:34.048 --> 08:36.048
Why are we parked in
front of the Haverford?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.417
- Well...
- Well, you've been upgraded

08:38.453 --> 08:41.620
from the hotel number
six to the Haverford Royal.

- [Reg] Seriously.

- Gooch, yeah.

- No, we've not met.
- I know.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.366
- I've been avoiding you.
- Yeah, well, that explains it.

08:54.402 --> 08:58.104
Yeah, so, you know, I've
been, um, studying the route.

08:58.139 --> 08:59.805

09:05.813 --> 09:09.582
For instance, why are we going
straight from here to St. Louis?

09:09.617 --> 09:12.384
[Harvey] I believe Tom Staton's
piano teacher is from St. Louis.

09:12.420 --> 09:13.919
Yeah, but that makes no sense.

09:13.955 --> 09:15.387

So the thing is, people don't realize

49:34.673 --> 49:36.573
that these songs that they
play at their weddings,

49:36.608 --> 49:40.544
a lot of times they come from
some serious pain, you know?

49:40.579 --> 49:43.847
- Yeah...
- Oh, baby!

49:43.882 --> 49:45.916
What a surprise!

49:45.951 --> 49:47.884
Look at you!

49:47.920 --> 49:50.387
[laughing]

49:50.422 --> 49:51.755
Yeah!

49:51.790 --> 49:53.523
This is Sandy, my wife.

49:53.559 --> 49:56.860
[Gooch] My wife, guys. Come on. yeah.

49:56.895 --> 50:00.330
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. [giggling]

50:00.365 --> 50:01.831
[indistinct chatter]

50:01.867 --> 50:04.568
[Gooch] [smooches] Oh, yeah. Oh-oh!

50:04.603 --> 50:06.069
[laughs]

50:06.104 --> 50:08.204
[Shelli] Well, I guess

50:08.240 --> 50:09.873
that's one relationship

50:09.908 --> 50:13.176
that... isn't cursed.

50:13.211 --> 50:14.544
Who knows?

50:14.580 --> 50:16.379
Can we get another beer?

50:16.415 --> 50:18.214
Can't always tell by looking

50:18.250 --> 50:21.952
what's... what's really going on.

50:21.987 --> 50:23.954
True.

50:23.989 --> 50:26.723
Look, I don't know what
I did to that guy

50:26.758 --> 50:28.258
to upset him so bad.

50:28.293 --> 50:32.896
Bill, it doesn't matter.

50:32.931 --> 50:34.931
Thanks.

50:37.502 --> 50:39.769
Burgers on me, by the way.

50:39.805 --> 50:41.805
You're on full scholarship.

50:58.023 --> 50:59.656
Ahem. [chuckles]

50:59.691 --> 51:02.325
You want to know one
thing I'm always gonna remember?

51:02.361 --> 51:04.594
The all-you-can-eat Tattle Tail buffet?

51:04.630 --> 51:08.164
No, it's the look on your
face when you finally grasp

51:08.200 --> 51:10.066
the real meaning of...

51:10.102 --> 51:12.602
- Shut up.
- "Do you enjoy jazz?"

51:12.638 --> 51:14.404
Oh, my God, I actually do.

51:14.439 --> 51:15.739
- Do you?
- Yes.

51:15.774 --> 51:17.907
Not the kind of jazz they
were talking about.

51:17.943 --> 51:20.377
[laughing] No. Oh, God.

51:22.014 --> 51:25.448
So our day off that didn't happen...

51:27.519 --> 51:31.321
did it somehow, somewhere

51:31.356 --> 51:32.956
happen in a parallel universe

51:32.991 --> 51:34.758
where maybe Rick didn't get lost

51:34.793 --> 51:36.426
and you got your scone

51:36.461 --> 51:39.429
and I didn't act like a jerk? I wonder.

51:39.464 --> 51:43.833
No. I mean, today was all wrong,

51:43.869 --> 51:47.003
but it was also kind of...

51:47.039 --> 51:49.973

51:50.008 --> 51:52.776
