(Jeremy)
[sighs] MORNING, CAMPERS.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.506
ANYONE CATCH TUESDAY BOOZEDAY
THIS MORNING?

00:05.539 --> 00:06.674
HODA WAS ON FIRE.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.342
(Morgan)
ALL RIGHT, DR. REED.
STOP, STOP.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.211
DO YOU HAVE ANY MEAT PRODUCTS
ON YOUR PERSON?

00:10.244 --> 00:11.712
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:11.745 --> 00:13.747
WHAT'S GOING ON IS I'M SICK OF
GETTING BIT BY DOGS EVERY TIME

00:13.781 --> 00:16.217
I TRY TO RESCUE THEM,
SO I'M TESTING MY NEW ARMGUARD.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.518
RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA NEED A DOG,
AREN'T YOU, TO TRAIN--

00:17.551 --> 00:19.187
[dog barking]

00:19.220 --> 00:20.621
OH.
IS IT BAD THAT HE'S FROTHING?

00:20.654 --> 00:22.090
WE ARE NOT DOING THIS,
MORGAN.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.158
LOOK, TAMRA'S MY FAIL-SAFE.
RELAX.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.293
I'LL TRANQ HIS ASS OUT.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.527
WE HAVE PATIENTS COMING.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.797
IT WILL TAKE ONE SECOND
OR SEVEN DOG SECONDS.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.232
JUST WAIT.
PLEASE, DR. REED.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.201
OKAY, BETSY.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.702
LET HIM GO.
I'M ORDERING YOU NOT
TO RELEASE HIM.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.605
COME ON, COME ON--
[screams]

00:37.638 --> 00:39.373
AH, OH, OH, OW!

00:39.407 --> 00:41.075
THERE, TAMRA!
FIRE!

00:41.109 --> 00:42.576
AAH!
NO, YOU'RE MISSING IT.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.478
FIRE AGAIN.
I'M TRYING! I'M TRYING!

00:44.512 --> 00:46.614
KEEP SHOOTING!
YOU'RE MISSING--

00:46.647 --> 00:49.517
OKAY!
[groaning]

00:49.550 --> 00:52.086
OH, MY GOD.
I FEEL GOOD NOW.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.821
(Jeremy)
MORGAN, WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED
FROM THIS?

00:53.854 --> 00:56.824
[hip-hop music]

00:56.857 --> 00:59.827

01:08.369 --> 01:10.671
(Morgan)
DR. LAHIRI, YOU HAVE EVERY
RIGHT TO BE FURIOUS WITH ME.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.706
WAIT, DR. L?
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.308
I GOT YOUR FAVORITE DOUGHNUT,

01:14.342 --> 01:17.545
BOSTON CREAM
WITH BACON SHAVINGS.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.213
NOW DO YOU FORGIVE ME?

01:19.247 --> 01:22.250
NO, MY--
ARE YOU CRAZY?

01:22.283 --> 01:23.284
DR. L, OKAY, I KNOW...
[horn honking]

01:23.317 --> 01:26.554
YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE MAD
OR MAYBE ON YOUR PERIOD.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.789
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM A LITTLE MAD AT YOU.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.291
AND I'M A LOT
ON MY PERIOD.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.427
YOU SEND SEXUAL TEXTS
TO MY CRUSH FROM MY PHONE.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.729
NOW, CLIFF'S DATING THE GIRL
DOWN THE HALL AND NOT ME.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.166
ARE YOU INSANE?
WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO ANSWER.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.368
INSANE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THEY'RE INSANE, DR. L.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.436
THIS DOUGHNUT IS STILL GOOD,
FOR THE RECORD.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.638
YES, MORGAN,
I LIKE CLIFF.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.374
DO I LIKE HOW YOU WENT
ABOUT IT? NO.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.176
DO I LIKE HAVING HIS TEXTS
IN MY PHONE?

01:48.209 --> 01:50.811
KINDA, SOMETIMES I LIKE IT
TWICE IN THE SAME NIGHT.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.380
OH, MY GOD.
YEAH.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.182
HOLD, HOLD--
CLIFF.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.316
HEY.
(Mindy)
HELLO.

01:55.349 --> 01:59.253
[groans]

02:00.588 --> 02:01.622
NICE DAY.
HELLO.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.623
OH, HI.
[stammers]

02:02.656 --> 02:04.158
YEAH.
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.327
YEAH.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.496
HOW'S HEATHER?
HEATHER'S GOOD.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.764
YEAH, UH, TONIGHT,
I'M TAKING HER

02:10.798 --> 02:12.466
TO THE NEW
CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOW

02:12.500 --> 02:14.435
ABOUT THE HISTORY
OF VIDEO GAMES.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.671
JOYSTIQUE.
HMM, THAT SOUNDS FUN,

02:17.705 --> 02:20.608
ALMOST AS FUN
AS YOU TAKING

02:20.641 --> 02:23.544
MY BRA OFF
WITH YOUR TEETH?

02:25.913 --> 02:26.947
[groaning]

02:26.980 --> 02:29.717
OH.
THAT IS A DIRECT QUOTE
FROM ONE OF MY TEXTS.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.820
YOU DIDN'T DELETE THEM?
I DID NOT.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.823
BUT...

02:35.856 --> 02:36.857
THAT'S JUST THE END
OF THE SENTENCE.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.292
I-I DID NOT
DELETE THEM.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.727
GOD.
STILL FRIENDS?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.330
NO, WE'RE NOT
FRIENDS, MORGAN.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.298
I THINK YOU ARE
A BAD PERSON.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.433
NO, CLIFF,
TAKE THAT BACK.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.601
TAKE THAT BACK.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.270
[sighs]

02:49.303 --> 02:51.939
IT'S SO RARE TO FIND A PRACTICE
IN MANHATTAN THESE DAYS

02:51.972 --> 02:53.407
WITH SUCH
A, I DON'T KNOW,

02:53.441 --> 02:55.376
WHOLESOME ROSTER
OF DOCTORS.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.878
YOU, THE BRITISH DOCTOR,
THE HANDSOME ONE.

02:57.911 --> 02:58.946
HANDSOME ONE?
YOU ALREADY SAID ME.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.281
[laughs]

03:00.314 --> 03:01.315
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SINGING
YOUR PRAISES

03:01.349 --> 03:02.383
ON MY MOMMY BLOG.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.384
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.219
(Mindy)
AAH! TAMRA!

03:05.253 --> 03:06.520
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.223
YOU CANNOT SHAVE YOUR LEGS
IN THE BATHROOM ANYMORE!

03:09.257 --> 03:10.224
I JUST SLIPPED
IN A PUDDLE,

03:10.258 --> 03:11.759
AND I HURT MY HIP
VERY BADLY.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.527
HELP ME UP.
I COULDN'T SHAVE AT HOME.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.230
RAY RON TURNED OUR BATHROOM
INTO A RECORDING STUDIO.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.299
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE BANNED FROM THE BATHROOM.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.132
YOU HAVE TO USE
THE BATHROOM

03:19.166 --> 03:20.301
ACROSS THE WAY
AT THE COFFEE SHOP.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.769
I'M BANNED
FROM THAT ONE.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.372
OF COURSE, I'M NOT CRAZY
ABOUT EVERYONE HERE,

03:24.405 --> 03:26.340
BUT I GUESS EVERY PLACE
HAS TO HAVE

03:26.374 --> 03:27.541
AT LEAST ONE OF THEM,
RIGHT?

03:27.575 --> 03:30.278
A MOUTHY DRAMA QUEEN?
YES.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.946
(Jeremy)
OKAY, SENIOR PARTNERS,
HOW DO WE SPEND THE SURPLUS?

03:32.980 --> 03:33.981
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.450
I THINK WE SHOULD INVEST
IN A LACTATION CONSULTANT.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.418
THINK ABOUT IT.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.952
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BREAST-FEEDING'S LIKE BASEBALL.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.288
THE LESS YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
THE BETTER YOU DO.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.789
I HAVE AN IDEA.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.724
OH, WE GOTTA BUY A TABLE
AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.893
OH, COME ON.
THERE'S US,
THE CAST OF GLEE,

03:45.926 --> 03:48.396
THE CAST OF SCANDAL,
THE CAST OF--
OKAY, SENIOR PARTNERS?

03:48.429 --> 03:50.298
I HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO
WITH THE EXTRA REVENUE.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.699
WHAT IF INSTEAD OF WAITING
FOR THE PATIENTS

03:51.732 --> 03:53.000
TO COME TO US,
WE GO TO THEM?

03:53.033 --> 03:55.369
I KNOW THIS VEHICLE
THAT WE COULD FIX UP,

03:55.403 --> 03:56.437
TURN INTO A MOBILE CLINIC.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.406
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SCAM US

03:58.439 --> 03:59.507
INTO BUYING YOUR FRIEND'S
OLD PARTY BUS.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.275
YES, IT IS
A PARTY BUS,

04:01.309 --> 04:03.344
AND YES, I DID LOSE
MY VIRGINITY THERE.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.613
BUT IF WE REFURBISH IT,
TAKE DOWN THE POLE--

04:05.646 --> 04:07.848
PETER, I THINK YOU SHOULD STICK
TO THINKING UP DRINKING GAMES.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.417
OKAY, JUST BECAUSE
I'M PRETTY

04:09.450 --> 04:10.951
DOES NOT MEAN
I'M A RECEPTIONIST.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.586
THOSE MIDWIVES TOLD ME
TO TELL Y'ALL THEY'RE HERE.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.422
[sighs]
LET'S GO.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.357
(Danny)
FOR THE LAST TIME,
WE'RE NOT GETTING HAND DRYERS.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.891
I LIKE USING PAPER TOWELS
TOO MUCH.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.793
THAT'S NOT THE REASON
FOR OUR VISIT.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.895
AS YOU ALL KNOW,
TRACY WHITFIELD

04:21.929 --> 04:24.298
WILL BE RUNNING FOR CONGRESS
TO REPRESENT OUR PART

04:24.332 --> 04:25.499
OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.067
OKAY, IT'S NEW YORK CITY,
PAL.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.370
DUNCAN AND I BELIEVE
THAT HE REPRESENTS

04:29.403 --> 04:30.904
THIS DISTRICT'S GREATEST HOPE.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.640
AND WE THINK IT'S COOL
THAT HE'S BLACK.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.041
EXTREMELY COOL.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.943
SO WE ASSUMED
YOU WON'T MIND

04:35.976 --> 04:39.046
IF WE HANG A FEW POSTERS
IN YOUR OFFICE.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.649
HEY, I KNOW THAT GUY.
WE WENT TO DARTMOUTH TOGETHER.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.684
THAT GUY CAN DRINK.
DARTMOUTH?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.586
WHAT'S HIS PLATFORM,
HIRE DAVE MATTHEWS

04:45.619 --> 04:47.388
TO REWRITE
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM?

04:47.421 --> 04:50.358
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE STANDS FOR.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.892
YEAH, BUT I KNOW
IF YOU GUYS LIKE HIM, WE DON'T.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.994
GOOD-BYE, DESLAURIERS.
YEAH, BOUNCE.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.929
COME ON, DUNCAN,
LET'S GO BACK UPSTAIRS

04:55.963 --> 04:57.631
TO THE 21ST CENTURY.

04:57.665 --> 05:01.068
OKAY, SMELL YOU LATER.

05:01.101 --> 05:01.902
HEY, MINDY?
[knocks]

05:01.935 --> 05:03.604
COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.406
YOU KNOW, PETER, I'M REALLY BUSY
WITH WORK RIGHT NOW.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.040
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LISTEN
TO YOUR BORAT IMPRESSION--

05:07.074 --> 05:08.108
"MY WIFE."

05:08.141 --> 05:10.711
I'M GETTING THE VIBE
THAT YOU AND THE OTHER DOCTORS

05:10.744 --> 05:12.780
MAYBE DON'T RESPECT
MY IDEAS.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.882
NO, YOU HAVE PLENTY
OF GREAT IDEAS,

05:14.915 --> 05:16.116
LIKE TRAILER TRASH THURSDAY.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.420
I KNOW THAT I'M A C.P.P.,

05:19.453 --> 05:20.488
CAPTAIN OF THE PARTY PATROL,

05:20.521 --> 05:22.122
BUT I WANNA BE I.B.D.,

05:22.155 --> 05:23.591
INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DECISIONS.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.526
I WANNA BE
A SENIOR PARTNER, S.P.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.928
UH, NO.
PETER, YOU'RE A JUNIOR PARTNER.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.897
THAT'S SO MUCH COOLER
THAN SENIOR PARTNER

05:29.930 --> 05:31.499
'CAUSE THERE'S, LIKE,
ONLY ONE OF YOU.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.434
WE HAVE, LIKE, NO EXPECTATIONS
FOR YOU.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.135
FOR INSTANCE,
I'M A GREAT LEADER,

05:35.168 --> 05:36.670
BUT I CAN'T MOVE HEAVY FURNITURE
FOR THE LIFE OF ME.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.905
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

05:37.938 --> 05:39.573
'CAUSE I'M, LIKE, SO PETITE,
YOU KNOW?

05:39.607 --> 05:41.074
I DON'T HAVE
THE UPPER-BODY STRENGTH.

05:41.108 --> 05:45.112
IS THAT THE END
OF THE CONVERSATION?

05:45.145 --> 05:46.414
(Danny)
YES!

05:46.447 --> 05:48.982
WELL, WELL, WELL,
WELL, WELL.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.384
LOOK WHO'S

05:50.418 --> 05:52.553
YOU WEAR READING GLASSES?
YEP.

05:52.586 --> 05:53.887
OH, ARE THOSE THE KIND
THAT CONNECT IN THE MIDDLE?

05:53.921 --> 05:55.022
MY AUNT CORA HAS THEM.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.590
THEY'RE REALLY RED,
DR. C.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.993
OKAY, ENOUGH WITH THE GLASSES.
LISTEN TO THIS.

NO, NO, NO, NO,
I'M NOT GETTING PLAYED OUT HERE.

06:41.702 --> 06:42.803
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED IS

06:42.836 --> 06:44.104
SOMETHING GOT MIXED UP.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.674
OKAY, THESE THINGS HAPPEN.
IT'S A FRINGE SITE.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.208
I'M SURE NOT MANY PEOPLE
READ IT.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.110
EVERYONE BACK TO WORK.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.079
BUT I DON'T--
MINDY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

06:52.112 --> 06:54.515
YOU NEED TO RETHINK
YOUR POLITICS, MY FRIEND.

I KNOW THAT SARAH

07:01.254 --> 07:02.956
EVER SINCE I SAW
THAT FIRST SONOGRAM,

07:02.990 --> 07:05.225
I JUST THOUGHT "KATNISS"
FOR THIS BABY.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.827
ANYWAY, ASK YOUR HUSBAND,
SEE WHAT HE THINKS.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.063

SEE YOU IN A COUPLE WEEKS.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.479
BUT WE WILL NOT
TOLERATE INTOLERANCE

07:25.513 --> 07:27.581
IN THIS BUILDING.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.817
(Brendan)
I KNOW YOU SEE ME.
DAMN IT.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.085
THOSE LITTLE BITCHES.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.922
SO WHAT IS THE COLOR
OF LOVE?

07:34.955 --> 07:35.989
WHAT THE HELL, DESLAURIER?

07:36.023 --> 07:37.958
WHY ARE YOU PICKETING US?
WE ARE NOT PICKETING.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.860
THIS IS A VIBRANT DISCUSSION
ABOUT RACE.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.629
SO WHAT?
WE DISCUSS RACE ALL THE TIME.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.830
JUST YESTERDAY,
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

07:42.863 --> 07:44.598
WHO'S HOTTER,
DEREK JETER OR ELI MANNING.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.133
JETER WON.
LANDSLIDE.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.735
DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

07:47.768 --> 07:48.769
YOU DON'T KNOW--
DANNY, IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.037
STOP, STOP, STOP.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.640
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.876
THIS PRACTICE LOVES PEOPLE
OF ALL RACES.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.578
HMM, VERY INTERESTING
COMING FROM YOU.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.581
THAT'S RIGHT, I DID A LITTLE
RESEARCH, DR. JEREMY REED,

08:00.614 --> 08:05.218
BORN 1980,
JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.655
EVERYBODY UPSTAIRS NOW.
LET'S REGROUP.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.790
HITLER, THE KKK,

08:09.823 --> 08:10.858
SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES.

08:10.891 --> 08:11.859
OKAY, THAT'S CRAZY.

08:11.892 --> 08:12.993
THIS IS PRISCILLA LANE,

08:13.026 --> 08:14.928
THE TOP PR CONSULTANT
IN THE CITY.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.229
SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.165
SHE HANDLED TAYLOR SWIFT'S
HIT-AND-RUN.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.134
WHAT? I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT TAYLOR SWIFT HAD--

08:21.168 --> 08:22.603
OH.
(Jeremy)
YEAH.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.738
NOW, LOOK,
YOUR PRACTICE IS IN DANGER

08:24.772 --> 08:26.574
OF EVICTION, A LAWSUIT.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.875
YOUR MEDICAL LICENSE
IS COMING UNDER REVIEW.

08:27.908 --> 08:28.876
YOU NEED A STRATEGY.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.711
I AM INDIAN.
I CAN'T BE RACIST.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.880
OH, PLEASE, YOU ONLY HOOK UP
WITH WHITE GUYS.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.782
I'VE HOOKED UP
WITH EVERY RACE OF WOMAN.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.617
HOW DARE YOU?
I WENT TO SECOND BASE

08:36.650 --> 08:37.785
WITH MY FRIEND
KOREAN JUSTIN.

08:37.818 --> 08:38.786
HIS HANDS
WERE SO SMALL.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.153
IT MADE MY BOOBS
FEEL ENORMOUS.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.789
EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID
WAS RACIST.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.757
PR CONSULTANT.
WHAT A JOKE.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.759
I REMEMBER WHEN "PR"
MEANT "PUERTO RICAN."

08:45.793 --> 08:46.960
HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING?
NOW YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO BE OFFENSIVE.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.095
LISTEN TO HER.
THAT'S NOT HOW WE TALK.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.296
DANNY?
YEAH?

08:49.329 --> 08:51.565
SINCE YOU ARE THE FOCUS
OF THE BLOG,

08:51.599 --> 08:52.800
I WILL GIVE YOU
ONE-ON-ONE MEDIA TRAINING

08:52.833 --> 08:53.801
TO PREP YOU
FOR YOUR INTERVIEWS.

08:53.834 --> 08:54.835
WHAT, ME?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.036
MINDY AND YOUR NURSE TAMRA

08:56.069 --> 08:57.705
WILL ISSUE
A STATEMENT ASSERTING

08:57.738 --> 08:59.807
THAT THEY LOVE
TO WORK HERE.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.675
ARE THERE OTHER
AFRICAN-AMERICAN EMPLOYEES?

09:01.709 --> 09:03.677
YES, JERRY, THE ORDERLY
WITH THE HOT BODY.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.712
NO, HIS NAME'S REGGIE.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.847
NO ONE NAMED REGGIE OR JERRY
HAS EVER WORKED HERE.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.982
MINDY, YOU AND TAMRA
WILL GO TO DINNER.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.818
YOU WILL WRITE A STATEMENT.
I AM ON IT.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.920
A FANCY RESTAURANT
THAT STILL HAS BIG PORTIONS.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.855
[sighs]
DR. P?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.124
I NEED ADVICE.
OH, YEAH?

09:17.157 --> 09:18.792
CLIFF SAID
I WAS A BAD PERSON.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.728
WELL, I TOLD YOU
TO DELETE THOSE TEXT MESSAGES.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.595
[sighs]

09:21.629 --> 09:23.931
OH, WHAT IF I GOT HIM A GIFT?
MM-HMM?

09:23.964 --> 09:27.034
I HAVE HUNDREDS
AND THOUSANDS

09:27.067 --> 09:29.136
OF BETAS,
LIKE BETAMAX TAPES.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.705
AS AMAZING
AS THAT SOUNDS,

09:31.739 --> 09:33.206
I DON'T THINK
HE WANTS A GIFT.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.274
HE'S A GUY.
MM-HMM.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.210
HE PROBABLY JUST WANTS
TO BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF YOU.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.879
LOOK, GUYS, LEFTOVERS.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.781
THE SENIOR PARTNERS
SAID WE SUPPORT STAFF

09:40.814 --> 09:42.149
COULD HAVE AT THEM.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.752
[sighs]

09:45.853 --> 09:47.020
DR. L.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.889
HEY.
HEY, TAMRA, YOU MADE IT.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.191
I ALREADY ORDERED FOR US
AND ATE ALL OUR APPETIZERS.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.259
SHOULD WE ORDER MORE?

09:52.292 --> 09:53.994
WHAT UP, DR. LARRY?

09:54.027 --> 09:55.963
I'M RAY RON, PLEASED TO MEET
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.297
AH, RAY RON.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.899
I'VE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.801
THANKS FOR DROPPING
TAMRA OFF.

10:00.834 --> 10:01.935
OH, YOU KNOW, RAY RON,
THIS IS ACTUALLY

10:01.969 --> 10:04.772
KIND OF A WORK THING,
SO I ONLY GOT A TABLE FOR TWO.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.674
HE DOESN'T TRUST ME
TO EAT DINNER ALONE

10:06.707 --> 10:08.942
BECAUSE THIS ONE TIME,
I ATE NEXT TO MANDY PATINKIN,

10:08.976 --> 10:09.777
AND HE FELL IN LOVE
WITH ME.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.746
DAMN, I HOPE
THEY HAVE LOBSTER HERE.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.849
I'M REAL ALLERGIC,
BUT I LOVE HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.085
SO, TAMRA, OUR STATEMENT.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.020
IT NEEDS TO COMBINE
YOUR BOLD ATTITUDE

10:20.053 --> 10:21.421
AND MY FIERCE REALNESS.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.923
GONNA BE KIND OF A...

10:25.959 --> 10:27.661
FUN ASSIGNMENT, I THINK.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.663
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.198
I'M GOING TO BE
A REPORTER,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.933
AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.101
155.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.769
WHAT?
THAT'S WHAT I BENCH.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.437
IT'S NOT A LOT,
BUT I CAN DO 12 REPS.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.873
12? SORRY,
THAT'S NOT THAT MANY REPS.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.342
LOOK, YOU NEED THE SKILLS
TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.911
I'LL CHANGE THE CONVERSATION.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.713
YOUR PROFESSION'S
A JOKE, OKAY?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.014
WHEN IT COMES
TO LEAST RESPECTED JOBS,

10:47.047 --> 10:49.016
IT GOES MALE MODEL,

10:49.049 --> 10:52.285
MUGGER, PR PERSON,
NOTHING.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.787
YOU'RE A GROUCHY BASTARD.

10:53.821 --> 10:57.390
YOU'RE A COLD-BLOODED VULTURE.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.265
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
FOR CHANGING THE CONVERSATION?

11:05.298 --> 11:08.401
OH, GOD, YOU ARE SO LAME.
PLEASE SHUT UP.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.804
AND THE PRACTICE
HAS GIVEN ME THE CONFIDENCE

11:10.838 --> 11:11.805
TO REACH
FOR THE STARS.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.240
I ACTUALLY BORROWED
THAT LINE

11:13.273 --> 11:14.975
FROM A COLLEGE ESSAY
ABOUT COMPUTER CAMP.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.244
YO, THESE CHICKEN TENDERONIS
IS TIGHT AS HELL.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.980
THAT'S CALAMARI, R-DUB.
YOU KNOW, SQUID.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.882
SQUID?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.851
OH.
I AIN'T NO PLAYED-OUT WHALE.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.119
HEY, YOU CAN'T DO THAT
AT A RESTAURANT, OKAY?

11:26.153 --> 11:28.956
RAY RON, IS THERE NO PLACE
THAT YOU NEED TO BE?

11:28.989 --> 11:30.958
SOMETHING TO DO?
OH, YEAH.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.861
I'MA GO OUTSIDE
AND VAPORIZE.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.096
B.R.B.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.132
TAMRA?
HEY, TAMRA?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.801
I'M SORRY.
I, LIKE, HATE HIM SO MUCH.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.902
HE'S SUCH A DEADBEAT,

11:41.935 --> 11:44.772
AND NOT THE HOT KIND
THAT BEYONCE SINGS SONGS ABOUT.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.273
THE KIND THAT BRITNEY
SINGS SONGS ABOUT?

11:46.306 --> 11:47.775
HEY, HOLD UP,
DR. L.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.877
RAY RON
MIGHT BE UNEDUCATED,

11:49.910 --> 11:51.879
UNVACCINATED,
AND HE HAS WEBBED FEET...

11:51.912 --> 11:52.946
UGH.

11:52.980 --> 11:53.814
BUT HE RESPECTS ME.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.916
AND I LOVE HIM.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.985
TAMRA, I THINK
THAT YOU NEED TO BE

11:58.018 --> 11:59.920
WITH SOMEONE
MORE LIKE YOU.

11:59.953 --> 12:00.821
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:00.854 --> 12:03.123
YOU CAN FINISH THAT STATEMENT
BY YOURSELF.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.491
I'MA TAKE
RAY RON HOME

12:04.524 --> 12:07.027
AND MAKE HIM MASSAGE MY BACK
WITH HIS MESSED-UP FEET.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.996
TAMRA, I ALREADY TOLD THEM
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.898
THERE'S CAKE COMING.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.867
[sighs]

12:13.901 --> 12:17.204
HEY, HAVE YOU REALLY BEEN
WITH EVERY RACE OF GIRL?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.072
PRETTY MUCH,

12:19.106 --> 12:20.974
EXCEPT FOR ONE.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.509
WHICH ONE?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.977
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.980
WHAT--LIKE PACIFIC ISLANDER?

12:27.014 --> 12:27.981
OH, GOD.
ITALIAN?

12:28.015 --> 12:29.549
THAT'S NOT--
OKAY, COME ON.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.985
(Brendan)
I'D NOW LIKE TO INVITE
SOMEONE UP WHO'S EXPERIENCED

12:32.019 --> 12:36.556
THE RACISM OF
SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES FIRSTHAND.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.026
[applause]
WHAT? TAMRA?

12:39.059 --> 12:41.228
(Brendan and Duncan)
* AGAINST THE OBGs

12:41.261 --> 12:43.330
* WE SING A SONG

12:43.363 --> 12:46.366
WAIT, I'M A RACIST NOW?

12:48.535 --> 12:49.502
WHAT, IT'S A RALLY NOW?

12:49.536 --> 12:51.071
NOW, SISTER TAMRA,

12:51.104 --> 12:52.840
YOU WORK
AT SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES.

12:52.873 --> 12:56.009
TELL US, HOW MUCH IS IT LIKE
1950s BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA?

12:56.043 --> 12:57.044
WHAT?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.178
WELL, DR. LAHIRI DID SAY

12:58.211 --> 13:00.180
I HAD TO USE
A SEPARATE BATHROOM.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.181
(Mindy)
YES, I DID.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.916
IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE YOU
WERE MAKING A HUGE MESS.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.018
THE MIDWIVES BELIEVE
ALL ETHNICITIES

13:05.052 --> 13:06.286
SHOULD PROCREATE
UNTIL WE HAVE

13:06.319 --> 13:07.955
ONE GORGEOUS
CARAMEL-COLORED RACE.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.056
[cheers and applause]

13:09.089 --> 13:10.523
IS THAT
FROM YOUR SEVENTH-GRADE DIARY

13:10.557 --> 13:11.458
WHEN YOU HAD
THAT EPIPHANY?

13:11.491 --> 13:13.927
SHE SAID I HAD TO DUMP
MY WHITE BOYFRIEND

13:13.961 --> 13:15.528
TO GET WITH SOMEONE
MORE LIKE ME.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.997
[booing]
WAIT, WAIT, OKAY, NO.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.432
I ONLY MEANT SMART
AND ATTRACTIVE LIKE SHE IS.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.868
YOU CALLED HIM
A DEADBEAT.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.435
(all)
WHAT?
HE IS A DEADBEAT.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.204
IF YOU KNEW HIM,
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.205
YOU THINK
HE'S A DEADBEAT, RIGHT?

13:25.238 --> 13:26.239
NO, I LOVE HIM.
I LOVE EVERYONE.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.608
AND IT'S OKAY TO CALL
A WHITE PERSON A DEADBEAT...

13:28.641 --> 13:30.110
NO, IT'S NOT.
OR UPPITY OR LAZY.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.344
OKAY, OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.479
THAT'S FINE TO CALL--
WELL, HE IS, DANNY.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.015
NO, NO.
TAMRA, TAMRA!

13:35.048 --> 13:36.917
SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

13:36.950 --> 13:40.921
WHERE IT'S OKAY
TO CALL PEOPLE NAMES.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.956
I'M TELLING YOU, WE SHOULD'VE
HUNG THOSE WHITFIELD SIGNS.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.457
HE'S A COOL GUY.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.459
YOU KNOW IN COLLEGE, HE TOOK
A BUNCH OF MUSHROOMS AND THEN--

13:46.493 --> 13:48.295
HEY, PRISS.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.229
I'M SO SORRY
I'M LATE.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.099
ONE OF MY CLIENTS
JUST SPIT ON A PAPARAZZI.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.066
I CAN'T SAY WHO,

13:53.100 --> 13:55.568
BUT HIS NAME RHYMES
WITH "SHMALEC SHMALDWIN."

13:55.602 --> 13:57.337
DANNY, GET UP THERE
AND FIX THIS.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.406
UM, I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK
HE'S QUITE READY YET.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.541
I COULD GO.
OBVIOUSLY NOT, PETER.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.376
WE'VE SPENT THOUSANDS.
DANNY'S READY.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.511
GET UP.
(Brendan)
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.546
HOLD ON,
WE HAVE A SURPRISE SPEAKER,

14:06.579 --> 14:07.981
DANIEL CASTELLANO,

14:08.015 --> 14:09.983
THE COVER BOY
FOR WHITEMOMMY.COM--

14:10.017 --> 14:11.184
JUST GIVE ME THAT.
GIVE ME THAT.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.253
OKAY, O--

14:13.286 --> 14:14.554
OKAY, SIT--
LOOK, I CAN TALK TO YOU

14:14.587 --> 14:17.925
ABOUT RACE RELATIONS
ALL DAY LONG,

14:17.958 --> 14:20.928
BUT I'M GONNA CHANGE
THE CONVERSATION.

14:20.961 --> 14:24.364
YOU KNOW HOW MANY BLACK FRIENDS
I HAD GROWING UP?

14:24.397 --> 14:26.399
FOUR.
COUNT 'EM.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.068
HE COUNTS
HIS BLACK FRIENDS, EVERYBODY.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.069
THAT SAYS IT ALL
RIGHT THERE.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.971
DUMMY.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.405
YOU DON'T CHANGE
THE CONVERSATION

14:32.439 --> 14:36.343
BY TELLING PEOPLE YOU'RE
CHANGING THE CONVERSATION.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.577
WELL, I WISH
YOU'D HAVE TOLD ME THAT

14:37.610 --> 14:39.146
INSTEAD OF HAVING SEX
WITH ME.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.648
(all)
OOH.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.951
I'M GOING.
PRISS, PRISS, PRISS, DON'T GO.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.485
PRISS.
FIRST, IT'S RACISM.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.688
NOW, IT'S AWKWARD SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.524
CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED.
I FIND THIS A LITTLE WEIRD.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.026
WOULDN'T YOU GUYS PREFER
TO GIVE BIRTH

14:53.060 --> 14:54.227
IN A PLACE
THAT'S MORE SENSITIVE,

14:54.261 --> 14:55.528
MAYBE ONE FLOOR UP?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.630
WAIT A MINUTE.
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.132
YOU WANNA TAKE OVER
OUR BUSINESS?

14:59.166 --> 15:00.300
HOW DARE YOU?

15:00.333 --> 15:03.636
THIS IS A DISCUSSION
OF RACISM.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.505
CLIFF.

15:05.538 --> 15:06.639
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.575
I KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT YOU WANT FROM ME,

15:08.608 --> 15:09.609
AND I'M HERE
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.145
KICK MY ASS.
WHAT? NO.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.181
COME ON.
I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.549
BIG MEAT.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.518
BIG MEAT HERE, HE'S GONNA
GIVE ME WHAT I DESERVE.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.252
HE OWES ME.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.088
MR. TOOKERS
HELPED ME MOVE.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.423
TWICE, OKAY?

15:23.456 --> 15:25.425
BACK UP.
NO, THIS IS FOR YOU.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.527
GIVE IT TO ME HARD,
JUST NOT IN THE TEETH

15:27.560 --> 15:28.495
'CAUSE MY SMILE'S
MY MONEYMAKER.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.030
NO, STOP,
NOBODY'S HITTING ANYBODY.
DO IT!

15:30.063 --> 15:31.164
OH.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.532
AW.
WHAT THE HELL?

15:32.565 --> 15:34.968
RUN, RUN, GO.
GO TO THE BRONX ZOO.

15:35.002 --> 15:35.969
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.704
OH, MY GOD.
[groans]

15:37.737 --> 15:39.406
THANK YOU, DUNCAN,
FOR THOSE ILLUMINATING WORDS

15:39.439 --> 15:40.307
FROM LANGSTON HUGHES.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.542
WE HAVE AN EXCITING
UPDATE, EVERYONE.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.544
SEVERAL NEWS VANS
ARE ON THEIR WAY

15:44.577 --> 15:46.513
TO HELP SPREAD
OUR MESSAGE.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.081
GREAT.
WE'RE GONNA GET CRUCIFIED.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.516
IF ONLY OLIVIA POPE
WAS HERE.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.085
OH, AND TRACY WHITFIELD
HIMSELF IS HERE

15:52.119 --> 15:54.521
TO LEND HIS VOICE
TO OUR CHORUS OF OUTRAGE.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.689
BUT, PETER,
YOU KNOW TRACY WHITFIELD

15:56.723 --> 15:58.158
FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF "DART-MOUTH."

15:58.191 --> 16:00.460
(Peter)
YEAH, I'VE SAID THAT,
LIKE, FIVE TIMES TODAY.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.095
HE'S THE ONE THAT STOPPED ME
FROM GETTING MY ARM BRANDED.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.563
GO TALK TO HIM.
MAKE THIS GO AWAY.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.032
PLEASE, PETER, HELP US.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.766
YOU NEED MY HELP?

16:06.799 --> 16:07.600
YES, WE DO.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.070
THE JUNIOR PARTNER
IS GONNA HELP THIS--

16:10.103 --> 16:11.338
WE NEED HELP.
PLEASE GO DO IT.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.140
PLEASE, PLEASE.
WE'RE SO SORRY.
OKAY, RELAX.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.574
I'M ON IT.
OKAY.

16:14.607 --> 16:15.775
HEY, YO, WHITFIELD!

16:15.808 --> 16:19.412
HEY. HEY.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.480
OH.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.682
THAT IS NOT MY FRIEND.
I MADE A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.517
WHAT--WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

16:24.551 --> 16:26.719
PETER!
OKAY, THAT WAS VERY RACIST.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.257
CLIFF, I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE DUPED YOU

16:30.290 --> 16:33.160
INTO A SEXUAL
TEXT CONVERSATION.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.361
I'M SORRY.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.429
OKAY, THANK YOU.

16:36.463 --> 16:40.567
I'M ALSO A LITTLE NOT.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.169
COULD'VE JUST
ENDED IT THERE.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.804
NO, I'M NOT SORRY
BECAUSE MINDY REALLY LIKED YOU.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.408
AND I THINK YOU HAD
A CASE OF THE HORNIES FOR HER.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.809
OH.
[sighs]

16:49.842 --> 16:52.379
I'M NOT REALLY CRAZY
ABOUT "CASE OF THE HORNIES,"

16:52.412 --> 16:56.283
AND I'M WITH HEATHER NOW.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.016
AND LOOK,
I DON'T THINK

16:57.050 --> 16:59.386
THAT YOU'RE
A BAD PERSON, OKAY?

16:59.419 --> 17:03.590
I JUST--I JUST--
I FIND YOU TO BE SOMEWHAT...

17:03.623 --> 17:06.226
UNBEARABLE.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.228
(Whitfield)
YES, SOME OF YOU ARE ANGRY.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.330
WE CANNOT
TOLERATE DISCRIMINATION,

17:10.363 --> 17:12.199
AND I WILL SHUT
THESE DOCTORS DOWN.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.201
IN MY DEFENSE,
I WAS DRUNK

17:14.234 --> 17:16.403
EVERY TIME I HUNG OUT
WITH THE GUY I THOUGHT THAT WAS.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.205
WELL, I'M GOING TO DO
THE DIGNIFIED THING

17:18.238 --> 17:20.507
AND JOIN THE PROTESTERS.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.810
MAYBE WE NEED TO GET PRISCILLA
TO COME BACK.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.413
NO?

17:26.446 --> 17:28.181
(Whitfield)
TOMORROW, ACROSS THE DISTRICT.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.783
NEXT YEAR,
TO THE HALLS OF CONGRESS.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.486
EXCUSE ME, GUYS.
MAYBE ALL THE WAY
TO THE WHITE HOUSE!

17:33.520 --> 17:34.654
WHO'S WITH ME?

17:34.687 --> 17:35.722
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D LIVE TO SEE

17:35.755 --> 17:37.190
A SECOND BLACK PRESIDENT.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.192
HEY, TAMRA.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.460
IT MAKES ME SICK
TO THINK

17:40.493 --> 17:41.694
THAT YOU MIGHT THINK
I'M A RACIST.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.496
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT RACIST,
DR. L.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.764
THEN WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

17:44.797 --> 17:47.134
YOU ARE A LITTLE--
ANTI-SEMITIC, I KNOW.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.368
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M PROBABLY GONNA MARRY ONE.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.869
NO, YOU CAN
BE CONDESCENDING

17:49.902 --> 17:51.771
TO THE PEOPLE UNDER YOU
AT WORK.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.673
SOMETHING, YOU GET A LITTLE
DOWNTON ABBEY.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.608
YOU'VE SEEN DOWNTON ABBEY?
SEE?

17:55.642 --> 17:56.876
THAT'S CONDESCENDING.
YEAH.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.278
SO WHEN YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO DATE RAY RON,

17:58.311 --> 18:00.580
A MAN WHO REDEFINES
MY UNIVERSE SPIRITUALLY

18:00.613 --> 18:02.482
AND GETS DISABILITY
'CAUSE OF HIS NECK,

18:02.515 --> 18:04.317
I JUST FELT DISRESPECTED.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.119
OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.156
LISTEN, TAMRA, I DO
NOT LOOK DOWN ON ANYONE.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.223
I'M SO SORRY.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.125
OKAY, GIRL.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.860
I DO LOOK DOWN
ON RAY RON.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.128
I'LL TRY TO GET
TO KNOW HIM BETTER.

18:15.162 --> 18:18.631
WE CAN'T LET THESE DOCTORS TURN
THE CLOCK BACK A HUNDRED YEARS.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.368
FOR ONE THING,
I'D MISS MY SMARTPHONE.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.769
[laughter]
GOTTA HAVE MY SMARTPHONE.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.771
ALL RIGHT, I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF THIS. EXCUSE ME.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.506
(Whitfield)
WE NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE

18:26.539 --> 18:28.208
THAT HATEMONGERS
LIKE SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES

18:28.241 --> 18:30.477
WILL DISAPPEAR
LIKE SLAVERY AND APARTHEID.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.778
THIS MESSAGE
IS MORE THAN--

18:31.811 --> 18:33.146
EXCUSE ME, MR. WHITFIELD?

18:33.180 --> 18:34.147
DO YOU MIND
IF I SAY SOMETHING?

18:34.181 --> 18:35.315
UM...
JUST GIVE HER THE MIC.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.516
SHE'LL GIVE US MORE
TO PROTEST.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.185
SHUT UP.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.252
UH, SURE.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.753
THANK YOU.
[clears throat]

18:40.787 --> 18:43.656
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'RE ALL
VERY ANGRY RIGHT NOW.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.691
[all booing]
SHAME.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.293
I JUST WANNA SAY
ONE THING,

18:46.326 --> 18:47.927
WHICH IS MY NAME
IS MINDY LAHIRI,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.863
AND I AM NOT
A RACIST.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.200
SURE, I TELL
EDGY JOKES SOMETIMES,

18:53.233 --> 18:54.033
BUT PEOPLE
REALLY LIKE THAT.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.603
IT'S GOOD FOR MORALE
IN THIS ECONOMY.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.937
(woman)
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.906
MOREOVER--
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

18:59.939 --> 19:02.775
SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES
ARE NOT RACISTS.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.644
WE HELP WOMEN
WHO ARE POOR,

19:04.677 --> 19:07.247
WHO ARE UNINSURED,
OF ALMOST EVERY ETHNICITY.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.282
IN FACT--
OH, ONE OF OUR DOCTORS,

19:09.316 --> 19:12.219
DR. DANNY CASTELLANO,
HE TOLD ME THIS MORNING

19:12.252 --> 19:13.253
THAT HE HAS HAD SEX
WITH WOMEN

19:13.286 --> 19:15.622
OF ALMOST
EVERY SINGLE RACE.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.757
DON'T SAY MY NAME.
THERE HE IS, RIGHT THERE.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.025
DANNY CASTELLANO.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.928
WHAT ARE YOU DO--
YOU'VE HAD SEX WITH A WOMAN
OF EVERY RACE.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.863
THAT'S PERSONAL.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.365
DOESN'T THAT BRING
A TEAR TO YOUR EYE?

19:25.398 --> 19:27.334
NO? OKAY.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.270
UM, ANOTHER DOCTOR OF OURS

19:30.303 --> 19:34.307
IS SPEARHEADING
A MOBILE HEALTH UNIT INITIATIVE.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.809
ONCE A MONTH,
OUR PRACTICE WILL TAKE A VAN,

19:36.843 --> 19:39.446
AND WE'RE GONNA GO
TO LOW-INCOME AREAS,

19:39.479 --> 19:40.847
AND WE'RE GONNA HELP WOMEN
IN NEED.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.984
[applause]

19:45.017 --> 19:46.653
ACTUALLY, SOME OF THE AREAS,
I THINK,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.721
ARE IN YOUR DISTRICT,
MR. WHITFIELD.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.659
SO, UM, CONNECTION.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.561
THE POINT IS
SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES--

19:54.594 --> 19:55.895
NOT RACISTS.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.297
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.298
WHITMAN 2014.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.799
WHITFIELD.
WHITFIELD.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.469
SORRY.
[cheers and applause]

20:02.502 --> 20:04.337
WAS IT OKAY THAT I MENTIONED
YOUR SEX PARTNERS?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.638
NO, I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.
OKAY.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.839
(Whitfield)
WOW.
WAS IT--OKAY.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.542
OUR DISTRICT COULD ACTUALLY USE
THAT MOBILE MEDICAL UNIT.

20:09.576 --> 20:13.280
[cheers and applause]

20:13.313 --> 20:14.781
YOU KNOW,
PART OF FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE

20:14.814 --> 20:17.684
IS KNOWING
WHEN TO PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS

20:17.717 --> 20:19.286
AND ACCEPT
AN OLIVE BRANCH.

20:19.319 --> 20:19.952
NO, NO,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.821
THIS IS NOT
AN OLIVE BRANCH.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.790
THIS IS A MASTER'S WHIP
THEY'RE HANDING YOU.

20:23.823 --> 20:24.991
OOH, HEY,
LISTEN UP, MAN.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.026
YOU'RE STARTING TO MAKE ME
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, ALL RIGHT?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.728
AND YOU'RE KIND OF WASTING
MY TIME.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.430
THESE PEOPLE ARE
BARELY RACIST.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.298
WAIT...

20:31.331 --> 20:34.467
SO THE MOBILE HEALTH IDEA
KIND OF--

20:34.501 --> 20:35.935
I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK IT SAVED THE DAY.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.905
WHAT WOULD BE
A GOOD THANK-YOU GIFT FOR ME?

20:38.938 --> 20:42.775
WHAT ABOUT MAKING ME
SENIOR PARTNER?

20:42.809 --> 20:44.977
FINE.
NOICE!

20:45.011 --> 20:46.846
AND I'MA BE
SENIOR PARTNER TOO.

20:46.879 --> 20:47.714
NO, YOU'RE THE NURSE.
GO BACK UP TO WORK.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.015
YOU WASTED
A LOT OF OUR TIME, TAMRA.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.283
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET BACK.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.519
(Whitfield)
HEY, MINDY.
HI.

20:52.552 --> 20:53.686
HI, I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

20:53.720 --> 20:55.322
THAT I REALLY ADMIRE
YOUR PASSION.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.122
THANK YOU.
YEAH.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.624
YOU REMIND ME
OF WINSTON CHURCHILL.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.959
YEAH, THE WAY YOU SPEAK,
THE WAY YOU WALK.

20:59.992 --> 21:00.960
OKAY.

21:00.993 --> 21:01.794
AND I'D LOVE
TO HEAR MORE

21:01.828 --> 21:04.564
ABOUT THAT MOBILE MEDICAL UNIT
YOU GOT.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.765
REALLY?
YEAH.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.867
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN TALK MORE
ABOUT IT OVER DINNER SOMETIME.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.402
SURE.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.338
I'LL BRING TYRA.
WHO?

21:11.371 --> 21:12.772
TYRA BANKS.
SHE AND I ARE DATING.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.341
SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND.
OKAY.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.775
GET OUT OF HERE.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.776
OKAY.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.545
(Peter)
YES, SENIOR PARTNER.

21:18.578 --> 21:19.746
(Mindy)
JUNIOR SENIOR PARTNER.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.881
(Danny)
PROBATIONARY.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.483
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO PRISCILLA?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.885
NAH.
NOT FEELING IT.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.420
THAT'S WHAT SHE TOLD ME.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.588
HEY, JERRY.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.923
GOOD MORNING, DR. L.
[mouthing]

21:30.957 --> 21:32.091
ALL RIGHT, RELAX.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.361
(man)
GO TO BED.
