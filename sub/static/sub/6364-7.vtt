00:10.277 --> 00:11.026
.

00:11.027 --> 00:11.776
- Ross mccadden.

00:11.779 --> 00:14.246
Six years on the job.

00:16.017 --> 00:19.385
- He was my homeroom instructor
at the academy.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.486
We were really good friends.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.355
I just talked to him.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.291
Somebody tell jenny?

00:25.292 --> 00:27.226
Has his wife been notified,
or...

00:27.228 --> 00:28.711
- Yeah.

00:28.712 --> 00:30.195
Street deputy
and peer support team

00:30.197 --> 00:31.597
Went to their house.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.076
- Lewellen?

00:44.078 --> 00:45.310
- Uh, yeah.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.784
- Sorry, man.

00:53.187 --> 00:57.156
- Fire alarm was pulled
right around the time of death.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.624
Security guard walked up

00:58.626 --> 01:00.426
Right when a guy
wearing a hoodie and a ball cap

01:00.428 --> 01:01.593
Was walking away.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.262
- What condition
was lewellen in?

01:03.264 --> 01:05.129
Was he out of the coma?

01:05.132 --> 01:07.232
- Yeah, he was responsive,

01:07.234 --> 01:08.600
Talking to doctors.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.236
- Where's the security room?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.704
- I'll take you to it.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.091
- He never saw it coming.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.193
- Horrible.
Just...

01:34.195 --> 01:35.327
Horrible.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.466
- Can you freeze that image?

01:42.103 --> 01:43.735
Ah, that's the only angle
you got?

01:43.737 --> 01:46.839
- Yeah, that's it.
- All right, print that out.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.242
- Not a lot to go on.
Sorry.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.243
- We've started with less.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.278
[door opens]

01:53.280 --> 01:54.646
- Hey.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.548
Voight's in the air
on his way back from new york,

01:56.550 --> 01:58.317
Wants everybody
to meet at the district,

01:58.319 --> 01:59.585
Two hours.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.134
.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.369
- All right, you all remember
detective rollins,

02:17.371 --> 02:18.804
New york special victims.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.173
This is detective amaro.

02:21.175 --> 02:24.143
They have full
jurisdictional powers here.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.645
And together...

02:26.647 --> 02:28.881
We're gonna end this.

02:28.883 --> 02:31.150
All right, this pedophile ring,

02:31.152 --> 02:33.619
They're desperate,
well-connected,

02:33.621 --> 02:36.622
And clearly they'll do anything
to avoid being exposed.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.458
We found the body in new york,

02:39.460 --> 02:42.928
But the head of the snake
is here in chicago.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.564
- Okay, so, bob clinton,

02:45.566 --> 02:47.733
He is our middleman
from new york.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.169
Now, ncmec tells us
that he was getting victims

02:50.171 --> 02:52.804
From a youth center
in times square.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.907
Now, a lot of the kids
were actually funneled

02:54.909 --> 02:57.309
To new york
from here in chicago,

02:57.311 --> 02:59.278
And according to our talks
with clinton,

02:59.280 --> 03:02.648
There is a higher-up,
a true shot-caller.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.616
- Now, clinton was
gonna give us a name,

03:04.618 --> 03:07.352
But he didn't make it
24 hours in jail.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.520
Was shanked in the showers.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.722
- We like lewellen...

03:10.724 --> 03:13.192
For financing this whole thing.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.294
Antonio, where we at
with the shooter?

03:15.296 --> 03:17.496
- Well, due to the poor quality
of the video,

03:17.498 --> 03:19.765
There's no match in
the face recognition database.

03:19.767 --> 03:23.368
Best we got is male, white,
around 5'9", dark hair,

03:23.370 --> 03:24.836
170 pounds, give or take.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.806
- So, patrol, you turn over
every stone you can

03:27.808 --> 03:29.374
To get an i.D. On this guy.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.709
- You got it, sergeant.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.779
- Ruzek, lewellen himself,
where we at with that?

03:33.781 --> 03:35.214
- Got to all his main accounts.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.748
Nothing stood out
except for payments

03:36.750 --> 03:39.551
To a oakbrook senior community,
western suburbs.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.220
Comes in at, like, $5k a month.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.387
- And that's relevant how?

03:42.389 --> 03:45.657
- Lewellen has
no living relatives.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.426
- All right, ruzek and amaro,

03:47.428 --> 03:49.595
Go check out this home.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.469
- Some black badge covers

03:57.471 --> 03:59.805
In honor of officer mccadden.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.942
Ross was a husband
and a father

04:03.944 --> 04:05.477
And one of my patrolmen.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.778
- Thank you.
- I assigned him

04:06.780 --> 04:09.481
To that hospital
protection detail.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.717
He was supposed to be
off the clock,

04:11.719 --> 04:16.421
But he needed the overtime
for his daughter's tuition.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.825
So when you find
the animal that killed him,

04:19.827 --> 04:24.796
And for whatever reason that
animal doesn't come back alive,

04:24.798 --> 04:26.798
You call me.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.700
I'll dig the ditch.

04:37.544 --> 04:38.543
- All right.

04:38.545 --> 04:39.711
Let's hit it.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.046
Lindsay...

04:46.754 --> 04:49.454
You heard from teddy?

04:49.456 --> 04:50.739
- No.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.023
The airline confirmed
he boarded the flight,

04:52.026 --> 04:53.558
So he should have been here
hours ago.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.626
- Look, we need him.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.211
He may be the only guy out there

04:56.212 --> 04:57.795
Who can identify
whoever's behind all this.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.731
- Hank, trust me, i know.
I'm on it.

05:20.587 --> 05:21.653
- Hi.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.322
I heard about
the police officer.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.457
I'm so sorry.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.443
- Yeah, thanks.

05:27.444 --> 05:29.428
Listen, i need to find teddy.
Do you know where he is?

05:29.430 --> 05:31.897
- Teddy?
I haven't seen teddy in years.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.632
Why are you asking?

05:33.634 --> 05:35.434
- Because i think
he's in trouble.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.035
- What makes you think
teddy's back?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.771
- Because i bought him a ticket
and asked him to come.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.807
He's been helping
with a case i'm working on.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.775
I think he's scared.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.410
- What's he into?

05:45.412 --> 05:46.778
- It's bad.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.247
You need to find him.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.715
- I know i should have
looked after him better.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.684
I know that--
- do not 12-step me, mom.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.720
Not now.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.622
Just find teddy for me, please.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.024
- Okay.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.428
[keyboard clacking]

06:03.430 --> 06:04.429
[door shuts]

06:04.431 --> 06:05.530
[knocking]

06:05.532 --> 06:06.898
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up, office?

06:06.900 --> 06:08.567
- Can you do me a favor?

06:08.569 --> 06:10.535
So roman and i have been
over and over mug shots.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.738
I mean, this angle makes it
tough to i.D. The shooter.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.473
Can you...

06:14.475 --> 06:16.542
Can you pull up just his face?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.610
Roman thinks there might be
something weird with his ear.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.579
- Yeah, no doubt.
[keys clacking]

06:20.581 --> 06:21.580
Yeah, roman's right.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.415
His ear is jacked up.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.783
- Yeah, what is that?

06:24.785 --> 06:26.485
- Cauliflower ear;
fighters get it.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.919
- I never heard of it.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.371
Okay, okay.

06:29.372 --> 06:30.822
So maybe roman and i,
we check out some gyms,

06:30.824 --> 06:31.990
See if anybody knows this guy.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.091
- You do your thing.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.493
- Okay.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.601
- Hi.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.069
- Visiting a family member
today?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.571
- No, chicago p.D.
We need to speak with somebody

06:46.573 --> 06:47.906
Who can look into billing
for us, please.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.941
- I can do that.
What's the resident's name?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.710
- Well, that's the problem.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.844
We only know
who's footing the bill.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.479
- Well, i don't know
if i can help you.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.914
I mean, if you don't
have a resident's name...

06:55.916 --> 06:56.982
- You being serious right now?

06:56.984 --> 06:59.851
- Nancy...

06:59.853 --> 07:00.952
Nancy.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.921
<i> ¿de donde tu eres?</i>

07:02.923 --> 07:04.055
- Cubana.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.791
- Cubana?
- Uh-huh.

07:05.793 --> 07:06.925
-<i> No me diga, chica.</i>

07:06.927 --> 07:08.727
-<i> ¿de donde tu eres?</i>

07:09.897 --> 07:11.930
-<i> Cubano puro. </i>
- [laughs]

07:11.932 --> 07:14.099
- [speaks spanish]

07:14.101 --> 07:15.834
- [giggles]

07:21.775 --> 07:23.608
- That's dorothy over there.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.676
-<i> Gracias,</i> nancy.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.677
<i> Muy amable.</i>

07:25.679 --> 07:26.845
- Anytime.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.817
- My ma told me
to take spanish in high school

07:31.819 --> 07:33.885
'cause i'd use it more
down the road.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.554
You should have seen
the french teacher,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.088
Madame lafleur,
you know what i'm saying?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.658
- I know what you're saying.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.760
- Ms. Hughes, hi.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.162
I'm officer ruzek.
This is detective amaro.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.964
We're wondering
what your relationship is

07:45.966 --> 07:48.033
With andrew lewellen.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.669
- Oh, i'm sorry;
i don't know who that is.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.838
- Ma'am...

07:52.840 --> 07:54.840
He pays for you to live here.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.007
- I know i'm old,

07:56.009 --> 07:58.910
But my brain's
not that addled yet.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.946
My daughter pays
my service fee here.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.247
- Ms. Hughes, what's her name?

08:02.249 --> 08:03.515
- Matilda.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.584
Matilda hughes.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.621
[touch tones beeping]

08:11.925 --> 08:13.508
- Yeah, nadia?

08:13.509 --> 08:15.092
I need you to look
into something for me.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.762
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.247
- Matilda hughes is an employee

08:19.248 --> 08:20.731
For the department
of children and family services.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.834
I spoke with her boss.
She's not at the office,

08:22.836 --> 08:23.902
And she's not
answering her cell.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.936
This is her home address.

08:24.938 --> 08:25.937
- Beautiful.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.239
- On it.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.777
- No pets.

08:32.779 --> 08:33.979
Always pays the rent on time.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.113
Nice lady.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.847
- When's the last time
you saw her?

08:36.850 --> 08:37.849
- Maybe three days ago.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.653
Maybe she's just out of town.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.921
- Let's find out.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.191
- Stay here.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.860
- Matilda hughes!
Chicago police!

08:48.862 --> 08:49.928
Clear.

09:10.083 --> 09:10.315
.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.850
- So?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.251
- Couldn't find
any other evidence

09:13.253 --> 09:14.853
Linking her to andrew lewellen.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.555
Her computer and cell
are missing.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.690
- How long was she working
at dcfs?

09:18.692 --> 09:19.691
- 15 years.

09:19.693 --> 09:20.725
- And how long was lewellen

09:20.727 --> 09:22.193
Paying for her mom
at the home?

09:22.195 --> 09:24.379
- Almost as long.

09:24.380 --> 09:26.564
- So she was funneling kids
to new york through dcfs.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.333
- I think that's the theory
to beat right now, yeah.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.734
- She's not the shot-caller,
though.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.386
Lindsay's brother teddy

09:31.387 --> 09:33.037
Said it was a white male
that was in charge.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.773
- This is gonna end bad,
i just know it.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.608
- I'm getting everyone else
over to her office

09:36.610 --> 09:37.876
At child services.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.579
We need to turn this place
inside-out.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.749
- I can't believe this.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.051
- Well, it gets worse.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.786
- What's worse
than getting murdered?

09:47.788 --> 09:49.321
- We have reason to believe
she may have ties

09:49.323 --> 09:51.957
To a pedophilia ring.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.291
- This is a joke.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.827
This is a sick joke
someone's trying to play on me.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.363
- Did she ever mention a guy
named andrew lewellen?

09:58.365 --> 09:59.698
- No.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.066
- Anybody else have access
to the files

10:01.068 --> 10:02.701
Besides dcfs employees?

10:02.703 --> 10:04.669
- No, not legally.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.305
- This guy ring any bells?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.007
- No.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.241
- We're gonna need
the personnel files

10:10.243 --> 10:11.876
Of all the employees
in the building.

10:11.878 --> 10:12.877
- Of course.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.813
- Was matilda seeing anyone?

10:14.815 --> 10:17.315
- Yes, gary miller.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.951
He'd breeze
in and out of her life.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.387
I think there was some...
Abuse there.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.322
She didn't talk about it,
but...

10:24.324 --> 10:26.191
She'd always let him back in.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.027
- Mr. Van camp, we're gonna need
access to matilda's office now.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.130
- I still can't believe this.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.232
- Come on, let's go!
Work it.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.401
- Aw, this one smells
worse than the last.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.270
- I got some vapo-rub
in the squad car if you want it.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.239
- Yeah, thanks.
Let's just get this over with.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.642
- Move over, come on, move.
- Hey, hey, excuse me.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.210
- Yeah.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.311
- Are you the owner here?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.412
- Yeah, i'm one of them, why?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.148
- You recognize this guy?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.383
- No. What did he do?

10:51.385 --> 10:52.784
- He killed two people.

10:52.786 --> 10:53.985
- Whoa, i don't know
nothing about that.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.387
- Anybody else here we can ask?

10:55.389 --> 10:58.323
- No, but there was one
of those mma tournaments

10:58.325 --> 10:59.991
At that avondale club.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.127
A lot of fighters were there.
- All right, thank you.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.929
- Yeah.
Come on, guys, pick it up.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.730
- How do you guys do it
in special victims,

11:05.732 --> 11:08.867
Working cases like this
all the time?

11:08.869 --> 11:10.268
- It's...

11:13.173 --> 11:15.774
- Well, there's an old saying...

11:15.776 --> 11:17.776
Carve your successes
in stone;

11:17.778 --> 11:20.378
Write your failures
in the sand.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.114
Just try and think
of the ones you saved.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.783
- I'll remember that one.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.870
- Oh, my god.

11:28.871 --> 11:30.821
Guys, my brother was in
foster care with this family.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.224
- You didn't know teddy
was in the system?

11:33.226 --> 11:35.360
- Uh, no, my--

11:35.362 --> 11:37.295
My mom checked out on us
for a couple years,

11:37.297 --> 11:38.797
And teddy and i lost touch.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.265
I thought he was living
with his dad.

11:40.267 --> 11:44.135
- Okay, so jill and sam whiting,
they live in irving park.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.337
- And it says that he was
with them for two months,

11:46.339 --> 11:48.006
Right before he went
to new york.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.408
- Do they have
any current foster kids?

11:50.410 --> 11:51.776
- Yeah.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.780
Amy kleinpass, 9...

11:55.782 --> 11:58.750
And chris sepka, 13.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.353
- Let's go pay the whitings
a visit.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.168
You hear from teddy?

12:17.170 --> 12:18.803
- Uh, not yet.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.438
- Okay.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.040
- He's not a player

12:22.042 --> 12:23.241
In the pedophile ring.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.409
He's a victim; that's all.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.277
- I didn't say he was a player.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.016
[knocking]

12:32.018 --> 12:33.418
- You're right; you didn't.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.086
I'm sorry.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.387
I'm just trying
to keep my head on straight.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.323
- It's okay.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.491
Lean on me,

12:39.493 --> 12:41.025
Or lean on your team.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.328
[cell phone ringing]

12:43.330 --> 12:45.330
Rollins.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.397
- Can i help you?

12:46.399 --> 12:48.466
- Sam whiting?
- That's right.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.401
- Chris sepka and amy kleinpass,

12:50.403 --> 12:51.436
Are they your foster children?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.471
- Yes.
- Are they home?

12:53.473 --> 12:54.973
- No, they're out.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.308
- Okay, we'd like
to come in and talk to you.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.144
- Um, let me just
put the dog out first.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.279
- Mm.
- Yeah, okay, copy that.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.848
That was...

13:03.850 --> 13:05.784
That was ruzek.

13:05.786 --> 13:06.985
Jill whiting...

13:06.987 --> 13:09.420
She died nine years ago.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.706
- If his wife's dead,

13:11.707 --> 13:13.991
Why does dcfs still have her
listed as a foster parent?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.929
Sam?

13:17.931 --> 13:19.330
Sam?

13:54.234 --> 13:55.433
Gun.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.536
Sam?

14:00.140 --> 14:02.373
- [mutters]
i'm sick.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.877
- Put the gun down.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.146
- I hate that i was
made this way.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.480
- Put the gun down.

14:09.482 --> 14:13.318
- I...Tried.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.452
But...

14:14.454 --> 14:17.589
- Hey, sam...

14:17.591 --> 14:19.924
You can make this better.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.960
- I'm sorry.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.211
- You hear me?

14:23.212 --> 14:24.461
You can tell us
where chris and amy are.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.597
- I'm sick.

14:25.599 --> 14:27.465
- Sam, she's right.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.371
It's gonna be okay.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.341
Sam, i'm gonna come
over to you.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.442
I need you to give me
the gun.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.113
Give me the gun, sam.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.381
No!
[gunshot]

14:48.622 --> 14:49.053
.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.490
- All right, dcfs employee
funnels kids to foster parent,

14:52.492 --> 14:54.058
Who, with the financial help
of lewellen,

14:54.060 --> 14:56.094
Funnels kids to new york,

14:56.096 --> 14:59.998
Where this guy photographs
and organizes the abuse.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.233
Now, is this hired muscle?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.935
The man in charge?

15:03.937 --> 15:07.038
- Well, we're still looking for
amy kleinpass and chris sepka,

15:07.040 --> 15:08.757
Believed to be abducted.

15:08.758 --> 15:10.475
- These are all the people
that are in matilda's office.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.076
Already interviewed
about half of them,

15:12.078 --> 15:13.978
But none of them had a clue
what she was up to.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.680
- What about the guy
matilda was seeing?

15:15.682 --> 15:17.148
Gary miller.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.483
- No, i got her phone records.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.051
There's no calls
to a gary miller.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.488
I checked her cloud.
There's nothing there either.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.692
- What's up, gents?

15:27.694 --> 15:30.995
Hey, you ever seen this guy?

15:30.997 --> 15:33.131
- Nah, don't know him.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.666
Vic, check this out.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.134
You know this dude?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.405
- You ever seen this guy?

15:43.410 --> 15:46.110
- Uh, nope.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.312
- I think you have.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.247
- What are you,
some type of mind-reader

15:49.249 --> 15:51.416
Or something?

15:51.418 --> 15:53.184
- Are you a saint?
You better be,

15:53.186 --> 15:55.420
'cause if you got anything shady
in your past, vic,

15:55.422 --> 15:57.422
I'm gonna find that out
with one phone call,

15:57.424 --> 15:59.457
And then i'm gonna
shove it down your throat.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.059
You, take a walk.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.660
I said take a walk!

16:04.097 --> 16:05.330
I want a name.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.597
- Look, man...

16:06.599 --> 16:08.433
I'm just minding
my own business, all right?

16:08.435 --> 16:10.268
- I'm about to get pissed off
here in two seconds.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.502
Now give me a name!

16:14.240 --> 16:16.374
- All right, got it.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.443
Here we go.
That was burgess.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.979
She and roman i.D.'d
the shooter from the hospital.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.014
Target's name
is todd ledbetter.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.149
Ran his sheet; he's got
a boat-load of violent priors.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.751
There's an active warrant
for his arrest

16:26.753 --> 16:29.554
On a violation of registration
as a sex offender.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.023
Witness says he dropped off
some hgh to ledbetter

16:32.025 --> 16:34.125
On the corner
of west huron and leavitt

16:34.127 --> 16:36.594
And saw him walk into a house
half a block up.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.762
- Let's gear up.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.089
[thud]
[man grunts]

17:06.092 --> 17:08.126
- On the roof!

17:14.099 --> 17:16.067
- Squad, this is george 5021.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.318
We're chasing an offender

17:17.319 --> 17:18.568
Through the 300 block
of leavitt.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.538
He's running west
along the roofs.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.731
[tires screech]

17:50.770 --> 17:53.071
Go, go, split up!

17:59.846 --> 18:01.712
[dogs barking]

18:42.522 --> 18:43.588

18:46.259 --> 18:48.659
[grunting]
uh...Uhh...

18:58.204 --> 19:01.906
Aah!

19:15.788 --> 19:17.388
- Breach the house.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.567
- Chicago p.D.!

19:51.357 --> 19:52.757
- It's clear.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.194
- Okay.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.198
- Yeah.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.836
- Chicago p.D.!
Anybody in there?

20:05.838 --> 20:06.871
Child: Help!

20:06.873 --> 20:08.506
- Hit it!

20:08.508 --> 20:09.807
[clang]

20:14.447 --> 20:15.613
- Amy?

20:17.283 --> 20:18.849
Okay, darling...

20:18.851 --> 20:21.285
Listen, you're gonna
be all right, okay?

20:21.287 --> 20:24.355
It's okay.
- Get a box cutter.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.557
Hey, we're gonna get these
off you, okay?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.392
We're the police; you're okay.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.927
Chris sepka, is he here?

20:29.929 --> 20:32.597
- They took him yesterday.
- Who's they?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.232
- The guy that lives here,
the big guy.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.233
You've got to get him.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.434
He's really mean.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.769
- We got him, okay?

20:38.771 --> 20:41.005
- Just hold still for me, okay?
- Easy, honey.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.608
[snip]
there we go.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.910
All right, let me see.
You okay?

20:45.912 --> 20:46.911
It's okay.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.346
Oh--

20:49.782 --> 20:51.616
It's okay; you're safe.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.820
It's okay.
You're okay.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.290
Here you go.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.564
I'm not putting her
in the system tonight.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.665
I'm not doing it.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.634
Not till we find someone
we can trust.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.901
She's coming home with me.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.770
- Lindsay, we can't.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.672
- Hank, figure it out.

21:14.674 --> 21:15.840
Please.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.489
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.691
Did you get him?

21:33.693 --> 21:36.394
- We did.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.862
Listen, trudy...

21:40.933 --> 21:44.935
There's a little girl.
She's a witness.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.471
I need to keep her
in protective custody.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.807
I'll get you the paperwork
in a little bit.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.909
- [sighs]

21:51.911 --> 21:54.545
Okay.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.747
Commander fischer
wants to see you.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.783
- [sighs]

21:58.785 --> 22:01.585
All right, give me a couple
minutes and send him up.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.754
- He's waiting in your office.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.979
- We're close, commander.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.414
- I understand that.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.916
- There's still
someone out there,

22:31.918 --> 22:34.385
Someone in power,
someone connected.

22:34.387 --> 22:37.588
This cop killer we popped today
was just a messenger boy.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.957
- This isn't punitive, hank.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.560
I just want fresh eyes
on the case.

22:42.562 --> 22:45.096
- "fresh eyes"--i don't even
know what that means.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.897
- A detective who works for you

22:46.899 --> 22:48.866
Has a brother
involved in this case?

22:48.868 --> 22:50.901
- He's a half brother,
and he's the victim.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.437
- And why did i have to hear
about that from someone else?

22:53.439 --> 22:54.705
- Well, i don't know.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.441
I guess i've been
a little busy, commander.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.677
- You've got one more day
on the case--that's it.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.479
Then it goes to major crimes.
- That's fine.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.914
I'll be happy to share this
with major crimes.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.517
- The case will be handed over
to major crimes

23:06.519 --> 23:08.052
In its entirety.

23:19.766 --> 23:22.066
- Where are you gonna sleep?

23:22.068 --> 23:25.136
- In my room, right in there.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.841
I can sleep out here
if you want.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.610
I'll just put
a blanket on the floor.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.745
- Okay.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.814
- Done.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.882
- Can we leave some lights on
when we go to sleep?

23:38.885 --> 23:40.618
- Absolutely.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.494
Listen, uh...

23:52.899 --> 23:55.466
When i was your age,

23:55.468 --> 23:58.169
I went through
some pretty difficult stuff,

23:58.171 --> 24:00.137
And my parents
weren't around either.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.472
- Yeah?

24:01.474 --> 24:02.973
- Yeah.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.910
But then, i met a cop.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.446
And he helped me.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.914
And now...

24:09.916 --> 24:10.915
Everything's all right,

24:10.917 --> 24:14.952
And all that stuff is behind me.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.688
I'm here for you now.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.159
Hey, it's okay.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.995
It's all right.
All that stuff's behind you now.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.864
I promise.

24:40.546 --> 24:41.545
- Hey, sarge?

24:41.547 --> 24:42.646
- Yeah.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.949
- Olivia benson's on the phone.

24:44.951 --> 24:45.950
- Thanks.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.052
Close the door.
- Yeah. Okay.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.655
- [clears throat]

24:56.062 --> 24:56.894
Olivia.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.262
- Hey.

24:58.264 --> 25:01.031
So, what's the latest
with the case?

25:01.033 --> 25:02.833
I hear all the rats
are leaving the ship.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.035
- Yeah, and i'm running
out of rats.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.505
Still haven't found the guy
behind all this.

25:09.275 --> 25:12.009
Feel like i'm pedaling
backwards right now.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.546
- So what do you need from me?

25:16.849 --> 25:18.716
- Your help.

25:23.890 --> 25:27.024

26:14.073 --> 26:17.074

26:17.076 --> 26:19.743
He was sending kids to new york.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.925

to hear it from you.

Hey...

26:46.906 --> 26:49.139
It's not your fault.

26:49.141 --> 26:53.310
None of what happened to you
is your fault.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.979
- You'd be surprised
how long it takes

26:54.981 --> 26:57.648
To convince yourself of that.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.783
- We have more suspects.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.919
- Yeah, and i heard.

27:01.921 --> 27:05.022
They either got whacked
or they blew their brains out.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.258
They can't be stopped, erin.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.994
They've been doing this
for 15 years

27:09.996 --> 27:11.261
And getting away with it,

27:11.263 --> 27:13.330
Putting kids like me
through the meat grinder.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.301
I can't help you.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.266

hank voight.

sergeant platt right there.

27:56.676 --> 27:57.708

27:57.710 --> 27:59.376

27:59.378 --> 28:01.845
This could go south real quick.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.717
From svu new york.

28:08.087 --> 28:11.422

fallen patrolman, i...

28:11.424 --> 28:13.791
I'm so very sorry.

- Thank you, detective.

28:47.793 --> 28:48.792
Good to see you.

Hey.

28:57.770 --> 28:58.936
So...

28:58.938 --> 29:01.438
That must be amy.
- Yeah.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.273
- Who owned the house
that she was found in?

29:03.275 --> 29:05.109
- An old-timer in st. Louis.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.744
Turns out andrew lewellen,
from the hospital,

29:06.746 --> 29:08.746
He was paying rent in cash
once a year

29:08.748 --> 29:09.847
For the last five years.

29:09.848 --> 29:10.947
No telling how many more
stash houses

29:10.950 --> 29:12.149
Could be in the city.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.784
- Okay, she give you
anything else?

29:13.786 --> 29:16.954
- No, in terms of what she
went through in that house,

29:16.956 --> 29:19.490
She didn't say,
and we haven't asked...Yet.

29:19.492 --> 29:21.125
- Anything from the missing boy?

29:21.127 --> 29:23.761
- Well, we're working on it.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.028
- [sighs]

29:29.535 --> 29:30.534
Hey.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.802
- Hey.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.506
I'm glad you're here.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.808
- I wish it was
under different circumstances.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.543
- That's the life we chose,
i guess.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.178
- That is correct.

29:45.017 --> 29:48.852
- They're taking the case
away from me.

29:48.854 --> 29:49.853
- When?

29:49.855 --> 29:51.421
- End of shift.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.459
- Well, i wish you
would have told me that

29:55.461 --> 29:58.162
Before you made me fly
all the way out here.

29:58.164 --> 30:01.298
- And miss
that smiling face?

30:01.300 --> 30:04.067
- We could have skyped.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.969
- We're close to solving this.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.471
I know it.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.339
- When are you expecting
the forensic results?

30:09.341 --> 30:10.340
- I already got them.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.408
- That was fast.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.377
- Yeah, i know a guy.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.662
- So do you have anything

30:14.663 --> 30:15.946
Connecting
all three crime scenes?

30:15.948 --> 30:17.181

31:17.109 --> 31:18.609

31:26.352 --> 31:29.386
That's the guy who's in charge.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.907

31:55.114 --> 31:56.680
- Yeah.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.590
- I've got nothing
to say to you.

32:12.398 --> 32:13.931
- Not yet, anyway.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.604
Where's the boy?

32:20.606 --> 32:22.039
- What boy?

32:24.276 --> 32:26.443
- Chris sepka.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.378

32:28.380 --> 32:30.514

what you're talking about.

Ah!
- Hank.

32:32.084 --> 32:33.183

back upstairs?

32:33.185 --> 32:34.518

you made the trip,

32:36.255 --> 32:37.587
But i'm gonna have
to cut it short.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.022

on that guy.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.456
- As far as you know,
i never did.

32:40.459 --> 32:41.759
- Let me explain
something to you.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.060
If this was
a chicago-only case...

32:43.062 --> 32:44.494
This is your city,
you do what you want.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.663
- Listen--
- no, i'm not done yet.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.232
I have cases in new york
that i want to close.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.234
I have perps
that i want to put away.

32:51.236 --> 32:54.304
There is peace of mind that
i want to bring to families.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.606
Okay, you go off on him,
and it gets out,

32:56.608 --> 32:58.408
Then my cases
go down the toilet.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.510
I'm asking you,
do not do that to me.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.512
- What about chris sepka's
peace of mind?

33:02.514 --> 33:04.514
That little boy
is out there right now.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.083
He doesn't have a lot of time.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.584
- Five minutes.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.020
I'm asking you for five minutes.

33:17.029 --> 33:17.294
.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.229
- Five minutes.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.066
- I'm a sergeant
from new york,

33:23.068 --> 33:26.403
And i've dealt
with some of the victims

33:26.405 --> 33:28.572
That you helped
funnel over there.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.340
- I don't know
what you're talking about--

33:30.342 --> 33:31.708
- Just listen to me.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.678
You heard the man;
we don't have a lot of time.

33:38.384 --> 33:41.351
I'm not an expert
on many things,

33:41.353 --> 33:45.222
But when it comes
to these kinds of crimes,

33:45.224 --> 33:47.791
Unfortunately i am.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.493
And, uh...

33:49.495 --> 33:51.194
There's one thing
that i can tell you

33:51.196 --> 33:53.130
With absolute certainty.

33:53.132 --> 33:56.733
When it comes to kids,

33:56.735 --> 34:01.371
Offenders who kept
their mouth shut

34:01.373 --> 34:03.507
Or had their lawyers handle it,

34:03.509 --> 34:07.344
I would see them years later
in prison...

34:07.346 --> 34:10.447
And they were zombies,

34:10.449 --> 34:12.349
Eaten alive
from the inside out,

34:12.351 --> 34:13.683
Because--

34:13.685 --> 34:17.353
Because they had a chance
to do something right,

34:17.356 --> 34:21.324
Even after
all the bad they did.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.226
But they looked the other way,
and when they did,

34:23.228 --> 34:27.097
They just snuffed out
their own lives in the process.

34:31.070 --> 34:35.304
I know deep down there's
still a human being in there.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.341
And i need you to access it.

34:38.342 --> 34:41.478
I need you to fight for it.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.414
I need you to bring it
up to the surface,

34:44.416 --> 34:46.716
Because,
as crazy as this sounds,

34:46.717 --> 34:49.518
You still have a life to live.

34:49.521 --> 34:53.690
You've got, what,
another 30, 40 years maybe?

34:56.295 --> 35:01.765
I'm telling you, the ones
who did the right thing...

35:01.767 --> 35:04.468
As hard as it was
to admit their involvement...

35:07.406 --> 35:11.575
They still sleep at night
in prison.

35:11.577 --> 35:15.345
They still feel the sun
on their face.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.383
You have that chance right now.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.227

38:26.371 --> 38:30.006
- Teddy's gonna stay
with johnny and me for a while.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.375
- Good.

38:35.047 --> 38:37.947
I can't thank you enough.

38:39.318 --> 38:41.318
I'm really glad you're home.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.354
- I didn't think
they'd ever be caught.

38:46.425 --> 38:50.593
And on top of all the shame...

38:50.595 --> 38:51.928
It's the hopelessness

38:51.930 --> 38:55.465
Of thinking that they'd
keep doing it over and--

38:55.467 --> 38:57.701
[exhales]

38:57.703 --> 39:01.404
I just really can't believe
this day is here.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.606
- I'm sorry
i wasn't there for you.

39:05.711 --> 39:08.345
- All of us, we...

39:08.347 --> 39:11.548
We went where the wind took us,
you know?

39:11.550 --> 39:13.650
- Yeah.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.952
Uh...

39:15.954 --> 39:18.822

of something upstairs.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.690

40:24.856 --> 40:27.624

40:27.626 --> 40:32.028

41:15.207 --> 41:17.841
