WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:03.300
Previously on "Hit the Floor"...

00:03.367 --> 00:04.600
You're a Devil Girl again.

00:04.667 --> 00:07.133
You want me back?
No, this is Derek.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.233
I'm not gonna stay here
just to watch you

00:09.300 --> 00:10.800
get caught up with
Derek Roman again.

00:10.867 --> 00:11.933
I'm coming for her.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.700
If I was trying to
buy the Devils...

00:13.767 --> 00:14.967
What do you want?

00:15.033 --> 00:16.633
Agree to trade Derek
and I'll keep my mouth shut.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.033
Kyle.
Beau?

00:18.100 --> 00:19.900
Since when are you
a movie producer?

00:19.967 --> 00:22.300
Since I learned how much
money you can make off it.

00:22.367 --> 00:23.633
You want in for half?

00:23.700 --> 00:25.033
Let's make a bomb.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.600
If we're gonna keep
the league at bay,

00:26.667 --> 00:27.867
I need to cut you out.

00:27.933 --> 00:30.000
You can't cut me out
of my own team.

00:30.067 --> 00:31.667
I can and I have.

00:35.167 --> 00:37.633
Should I leave first
or should you?

00:37.700 --> 00:39.100
I'm still your secret!

00:39.167 --> 00:41.000
You work for Oscar.
I do.

00:41.067 --> 00:42.133
What's that for?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.567
Your suicide note.

00:43.633 --> 00:45.800
Aah!
(grunts)

00:45.867 --> 00:47.633
I'm moving in.
I'm also gonna hire someone

00:47.700 --> 00:49.200
to look after you when
I'm not around.

00:49.267 --> 00:51.333
Oscar is not getting
another crack at you.

00:51.400 --> 00:56.100
I need it now...
for protection.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.267
**

01:13.567 --> 01:16.100
Why am I the only one
moving out?

01:16.167 --> 01:19.200
I'll be fine here.

01:19.267 --> 01:20.867
This is a precaution.

01:20.933 --> 01:23.400
Pete's moving in,
he's hired me a bodyguard.

01:23.467 --> 01:25.067
Let's focus on
the positive.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.500
What positive?

01:26.567 --> 01:28.100
You're back where
you wanna be,

01:28.167 --> 01:29.600
with the Devil Girls.

01:29.667 --> 01:32.167
And your new roomie's
pretty hot.

01:32.233 --> 01:34.067
He a'ight.

01:34.067 --> 01:36.167
(sighs)
This was everything
that was left

01:36.233 --> 01:37.967
in your closet.

01:38.067 --> 01:39.867
Uh...

01:39.933 --> 01:41.567
these are mine.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.500
German, thank you for always
being so protective of Ahsha.

01:48.633 --> 01:51.933
I'm not gonna let her
out of my sight.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.133
You look tired.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.600
He hasn't been
sleeping.

01:54.667 --> 01:57.800
I'm just excited
about opening game.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.900
I'll bring this
out to the car.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.967
Opening game's a pretty
big deal for you too.

02:04.067 --> 02:06.800
You're choreographing.

02:06.867 --> 02:08.367
Did Jelena bust
a blood vessel?

02:08.433 --> 02:10.233
At least tell me
she hit a wall slide.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.700
(chuckles)

02:11.767 --> 02:14.433
It's hard to feel good
about anything

02:14.500 --> 02:16.567
when you're going
through all of this.

02:16.633 --> 02:18.567
All of this will be
over soon.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.733
In the meantime,
I'm not letting Oscar

02:20.800 --> 02:22.900
get to me one damn bit,
and don't you, either.

02:27.867 --> 02:29.100
(sighs)

02:32.067 --> 02:34.233
You can't split profits
if there aren't any.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.900
So, we need to make sure
that the movie of your life

02:37.967 --> 02:39.533
is a bigger turd
than "Juwanna Mann".

02:39.600 --> 02:42.400
Well, making Teddy the director
was a good start.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.467
He's off scouting locations.

02:44.533 --> 02:46.733
Poor thing thinks
he's creating a masterpiece.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.067
Well, I'm shocked
he thinks at all.

02:49.100 --> 02:52.267
First things first.
Since it's my life story,

02:52.333 --> 02:54.067
we're gonna need
a lot of men.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.567
Hot, stupid men.

02:56.633 --> 02:59.533
I put out a casting call
and I booked a room.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.133
We don't even have
a script yet though,

03:01.200 --> 03:04.067
so what are they
gonna read?

03:04.133 --> 03:06.533
These.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.333
Okay.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.233
Yeah, um... I think we're
gonna need an actual script,

03:12.300 --> 03:13.833
and I'm gonna need you
to help me with that.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.333
It's supposed to be crap,
get a monkey to help you.

03:16.400 --> 03:20.300
You're in on this for half,
you need to help me with half.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.067
(gasps)
Raquel?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.300
What are you doing here?

03:23.367 --> 03:24.667
Didn't you have
a date last night?

03:24.733 --> 03:26.200
I did, but it was
over by 10:00.

03:26.267 --> 03:28.467
I found this awesome
series on Netflix though--

03:28.533 --> 03:31.200
That is not a new leaf,
that is an old leaf.

03:31.267 --> 03:34.467
An old, dry,
sexless leaf.

03:34.533 --> 03:36.133
She can do casting.

03:36.200 --> 03:40.400
Yeah, just let her be
surrounded by hot, stupid men.

03:40.467 --> 03:42.167
Casting?

03:42.233 --> 03:43.167
Yeah.

03:43.233 --> 03:45.667
Meet my mystery producer.

03:45.733 --> 03:49.167
Great.
This is all set up for you.

03:49.233 --> 03:51.867
I thought we weren't spending
any money on this movie.

03:51.933 --> 03:53.533
Now, we can afford
a casting director?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.933
This is important.

03:55.067 --> 03:57.667
So is making sure the guys
in this movie are packing.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.300
Talent.
Packing talent.

04:01.367 --> 04:04.467
You know, all famous writers,
they go to Big Bear

04:04.533 --> 04:07.233
and they lock
themselves in a cabin.

04:07.300 --> 04:11.933
Then they just pound away
at their screenplays.

04:14.833 --> 04:18.633
I suppose a decent
script is important.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.067
You know,
I'm completely aware

04:20.133 --> 04:21.767
you're talking
about sex, right?

04:28.200 --> 04:29.467
Dee.

04:29.533 --> 04:31.067
How you doing?

04:31.067 --> 04:32.333
Good.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.200
You don't have to be good,
I know it's tough

04:34.267 --> 04:35.733
sitting out.
For now.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.700
I'll be back
calling the shots.

04:37.767 --> 04:38.833
Don't you worry.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.967
Of course.
All right.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.933
I feel like garbage.

04:47.067 --> 04:50.433
Agreeing to trade Derek
to shut Zero up.

04:50.500 --> 04:54.433
(sighs)
We did what we had to do.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.467
Now, we focus
on what's next.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.967
We've got the money
to buy the team.

04:59.067 --> 05:01.700
Now, we need to convince
the league to take it.

05:01.767 --> 05:04.500
And how do we that?

05:04.567 --> 05:06.733
We don't.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.933
Someone else does.

05:09.067 --> 05:12.400
Derek's back, it's great,
we couldn't be happier.

05:12.467 --> 05:15.133
Hey, boss.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.067
I'll call you back.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.167
I thought I told you
at the masquerade,

05:22.233 --> 05:24.100
unless you have
something to offer me--

05:24.167 --> 05:26.267
Stay away, right.

05:27.633 --> 05:29.133
I have something
to offer you.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.533
Information.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.233
What information?

05:32.300 --> 05:35.933
I know who the potential
buyers for the team are.

05:36.067 --> 05:37.100
Who?

05:37.167 --> 05:39.800
Terrence and Jelena.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.233
Not only that,
they made a deal with me.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.533
If I kept my mouth
shut about it,

05:44.600 --> 05:46.867
they'd trade Derek.

05:46.933 --> 05:48.767
Why would you
tell me this?

05:48.833 --> 05:50.333
That deal would be
great for you.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.133
I didn't make it for me.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.067
I made it for you,
so you had something

05:56.067 --> 05:59.800
to do real damage with
when you needed to.

06:01.433 --> 06:03.267
I appreciate it.

06:03.333 --> 06:06.533
But information is not what
I'm looking for from you.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.367
It doesn't change
anything between us.

06:12.867 --> 06:14.967
The delusion!

06:15.067 --> 06:16.400
How big must
their egos be

06:16.467 --> 06:18.100
to think they can pull
something off like this?

06:18.167 --> 06:19.833
I wouldn't
underestimate them.

06:19.900 --> 06:22.367
After that game seven,
Terrence is a god.

06:22.433 --> 06:23.567
And Jelena, she's--

06:23.633 --> 06:24.967
A deranged bitch.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.267
They must not have all
the support they need yet

06:28.333 --> 06:30.167
for this to be a secret.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.333
I'm gonna beat them
at their own game.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.800
They can throw a big party?

06:34.867 --> 06:37.600
I can throw
a bigger one.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.067
I'm gonna turn
opening game

06:39.100 --> 06:43.933
into the biggest media event
this sport has ever seen.

06:46.867 --> 06:48.900
What's so important?

06:48.967 --> 06:51.400
Actually, I just asked
to see the Devil Girl

06:51.467 --> 06:53.100
in charge of
the first dance.

06:53.167 --> 06:55.167
(scoffs)
But since you're here,

06:55.233 --> 06:57.667
I suppose I could
fill you in.

06:59.233 --> 07:03.233
Opening game is going to be
a no-expense-spared epic.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.067
Every fan is
getting in for free.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.367
There's going to be a lottery
to decide who gets tickets.

07:08.433 --> 07:11.867
I'm flying the media out
to Vegas on the Devils' jet

07:11.933 --> 07:13.667
so they can cover
the numbers being pulled.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.067
Whoa.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.633
What does this have to do
with the Devil Girls?

07:16.700 --> 07:18.633
I'm ponying up 200-grand

07:18.700 --> 07:21.967
to put on the biggest show
halftime's ever seen.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.533
You're giving
the Devil Girls $200,000?

07:24.600 --> 07:28.067
No... I'm giving
Ahsha $200,000.

07:28.100 --> 07:28.933
(scoffs)

07:29.067 --> 07:30.400
For this one dance.

07:30.467 --> 07:32.933
Are you serious?

07:33.067 --> 07:36.700
Can you imagine how much
press Ahsha's gonna get?

07:36.767 --> 07:40.133
I don't imagine.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.467
Excuse me, I have
work to do...

07:42.533 --> 07:44.967
as do you.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.067
I'm going there
to socialize

07:48.067 --> 07:49.433
with some of the other
team owners.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.167
You'll be drawing
the winning lottery numbers

07:52.233 --> 07:54.400
and doing a few
interviews.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.633
So, make sure you work
on that pageant smile.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.067
I'll be?

07:58.100 --> 08:01.267
Pack your bags, Ahsha.
You're going to Vegas.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.333
* I got so much money
so much money, I can't count *

08:06.400 --> 08:08.067
What we're about
to share with you

08:08.100 --> 08:10.967
is beyond sensitive.

08:11.067 --> 08:14.633
Your discretion would
be much appreciated.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.533
Lionel is a huge problem
for everyone.

08:17.600 --> 08:23.067
So, we're stepping up
to do something about it.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.767
We're making a play
to buy the team.

08:25.833 --> 08:29.300
And we need
your help to do it.

08:38.067 --> 08:42.533
Solid piece.
Hardly any kickback.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.967
You got a good deal.

08:44.067 --> 08:46.167
Well, you can't tell
Pete I have it.

08:46.233 --> 08:47.833
Even if he's paying
you to watch me,

08:47.900 --> 08:49.600
if he knew I had it...

08:49.667 --> 08:51.733
I won't say a word.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.067
I think you were smart
to get it however you got it.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.900
Some people would argue,
but I think you're safer

08:57.967 --> 09:01.067
having it
given your situation.

09:02.300 --> 09:06.167
But only if you know how
to properly fire it.

09:06.233 --> 09:09.600
I haven't thought
that far ahead...

09:09.667 --> 09:12.367
actually shooting it.

09:12.433 --> 09:15.633
Well, you have to.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.333
Like this.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.567
(sighs)

09:41.100 --> 09:43.067
Why would Terrence
and Jelena want you?

09:43.067 --> 09:45.967
Well, the last time a team was
forced onto the auction block,

09:46.067 --> 09:48.333
a team's coach
pulled a lot of sway.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.167
They're counting on me
to help trump

09:50.233 --> 09:51.500
whatever favor
Lionel has left.

09:51.567 --> 09:54.100
No way should you
even consider it.

09:54.167 --> 09:56.200
Well, I thought you
wanted Lionel out.

09:56.267 --> 09:59.167
I do, but not to make
room for Jelena.

09:59.233 --> 10:01.567
(scoffs, sighs)

10:06.233 --> 10:07.833
I think it's a good idea.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.400
Anyone else but Lionel
means that you're safer.

10:11.467 --> 10:13.300
Jelena is a snake,

10:13.367 --> 10:14.800
the kind that can't
even be bothered

10:14.867 --> 10:16.100
to unhinge her jaw.

10:16.167 --> 10:20.100
Yeah, but Jelena has
one thing that Lionel doesn't.

10:20.167 --> 10:22.133
Terrence.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.600
Sloane, he is a good guy.
Pete...

10:24.667 --> 10:28.000
Meet with him, just...
before you make up your mind,

10:28.067 --> 10:29.700
just meet with him.

10:31.633 --> 10:32.867
Okay.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.800
Lucas.

10:43.867 --> 10:46.100
Hey.
Jude.

10:46.167 --> 10:49.033
Listen, um...
I wanted to say sorry

10:49.100 --> 10:50.567
about our date.

10:50.633 --> 10:52.900
I know I was a buzzkill
going on and on

10:52.967 --> 10:54.800
about another guy.

10:54.867 --> 10:57.400
I'm trying to be
better about that.

10:57.467 --> 11:01.867
So, hypothetically,
if we were to go out again,

11:01.933 --> 11:03.667
I wouldn't have to hear
about Mr. Perfect?

11:03.733 --> 11:06.600
He's not perfect,
not by...

11:09.467 --> 11:10.900
You wouldn't have
to hear about him.

11:10.967 --> 11:12.633
Good.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.200
I'll pick you up
tomorrow at 8:00.

11:15.267 --> 11:16.733
Wear something slutty.

11:19.433 --> 11:22.133
(Kyle laughing)
Whoo!

11:22.200 --> 11:23.967
(moans)

11:26.833 --> 11:28.900
Mmm.

11:28.967 --> 11:31.333
(chuckles)
Whoo!

11:31.400 --> 11:33.233
I thought we were
supposed to be writing.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.867
Oh, yeah, right.
Okay.

11:45.133 --> 11:47.467
(typing)
Fade in.

11:47.533 --> 11:51.900
Kyle Hart
dances her way

11:51.967 --> 11:55.267
into L.A. in search
of love.

11:55.333 --> 11:56.533
Wait, now, hold on.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.500
I didn't come here
in search of love.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.867
What'd you come
in search of?

12:00.933 --> 12:03.567
Anything with
a gift receipt.

12:06.533 --> 12:10.433
* This is where
the wild things are *

12:10.500 --> 12:12.433
(clears throat)
Okay.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.467
Kyle Hart loved men.

12:15.533 --> 12:18.967
She also loved gifts.

12:19.067 --> 12:22.567
From all her
many men,

12:22.633 --> 12:28.800
her favorite gift was...

12:28.867 --> 12:32.567
Her divorce from
her no-good husband.

12:32.633 --> 12:34.367
Hmm.

12:34.433 --> 12:36.333
What?

12:36.400 --> 12:39.300
That was thanks to me.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.233
Her apartment
was a good gift too.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.100
Yeah.
Two walk-in closets.

12:43.167 --> 12:44.567
Closets are good.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.533
I need a break.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.900
I could use one too.
Yeah? Oh.

12:51.967 --> 12:54.600
(gasps, laughs)

12:56.500 --> 12:59.233
So, these are gonna
be glowing on the day.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.233
I'll show you how you're
gonna be using them.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.800
Lasers will fall
from there.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.600
And from there
and from...

13:08.833 --> 13:10.533
Jelena?

13:12.067 --> 13:13.667
Need my help already?

13:13.733 --> 13:16.733
I need you to get in position
so you can learn the steps.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.733
Mmm.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.433
I'll pick them up,
don't worry.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.933
Timing needs to be perfect

13:21.067 --> 13:23.400
when there's $200,000
worth of bells and whistles

13:23.467 --> 13:24.533
going off around us.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.267
We need to do this
together.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.733
Seriously?

13:28.800 --> 13:30.133
I don't have
a lot of time.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.833
I have to leave in an hour
to pack for Vegas.

13:45.467 --> 13:47.800
Okay, from the top.

13:47.867 --> 13:50.133
And one and two,
three and four.

14:01.367 --> 14:03.833
(glass breaking)

14:03.900 --> 14:06.433
Whoa, whoa!
What happened?

14:06.500 --> 14:09.433
I, uh... I was updating
your binders

14:09.500 --> 14:11.100
and I knocked it
off the desk.

14:11.167 --> 14:12.767
(clears throat)

14:14.200 --> 14:15.867
Here.

14:17.067 --> 14:18.800
How late were you
out last night?

14:18.867 --> 14:21.933
(sighs)
There's a lot going on.

14:22.067 --> 14:25.267
Well, I'd get some sleep
before you do more damage.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.767
(sighs)

14:37.533 --> 14:39.067
(Zero)
Terrence is out.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.067
I'm in.

14:41.067 --> 14:43.500
All over the place.

14:43.567 --> 14:46.200
You really didn't have to go
through all this to say thanks,

14:46.267 --> 14:48.600
but I'm glad you did.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.467
That's all Lionel.

14:51.533 --> 14:53.833
Part of our new
media strategy.

14:53.900 --> 14:57.267
You're a valuable
member of the team.

14:57.333 --> 14:58.533
Night.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.933
I'm a valuable
member of the team?

15:02.067 --> 15:04.933
I mean, you're talking
to me like I'm a stranger.

15:05.067 --> 15:07.200
After everything
I did for you?

15:07.267 --> 15:10.200
You either refuse to get it
or you never will.

15:12.433 --> 15:15.533
I love you.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.100
All right?

15:22.967 --> 15:26.533
I...

15:26.600 --> 15:28.633
I love you, stupid.

15:31.733 --> 15:33.500
I love you too.

15:36.800 --> 15:41.067
And even still,
it doesn't matter.

15:41.067 --> 15:42.667
Love isn't enough.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.700
I need someone
I can actually be with

15:44.767 --> 15:47.633
like a normal person.

15:47.700 --> 15:51.967
Someone who's able to
be there for me in every way.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.267
Can you?

15:54.700 --> 15:56.267
Can you do that?

16:03.400 --> 16:05.267
No.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.267
(car starting)

16:23.333 --> 16:26.433
* It's time to turn
this place upside-down *

16:26.500 --> 16:30.233
* Let it go, act a fool
start a fight in the room *

16:30.300 --> 16:33.400
* We 'bout to burn the place
down to the ground *

16:33.467 --> 16:35.533
You looking for
some company?

16:35.600 --> 16:38.700
No, I'm just waiting
for my room to be ready.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.167
Mine's ready now.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.567
How much?

16:42.633 --> 16:44.500
How much what?

16:45.700 --> 16:48.067
You think
I'm a prostitute?

16:48.067 --> 16:51.067
Hey, I'd be happy to help put
you through nursing school.

16:54.733 --> 16:55.900
This guy bothering you?

16:55.967 --> 16:57.800
You're--
About to be real upset

16:57.867 --> 16:59.233
if you don't back up
off my girl.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.367
No.
Big fan.

17:02.433 --> 17:04.067
Scared of you.

17:04.133 --> 17:05.633
I'm sorry.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.967
(clears throat)

17:12.400 --> 17:13.633
You're staying here too?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.800
Lionel's having
a huge media event.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.700
Of course the Roman emperor's
gonna be part of it.

17:20.067 --> 17:22.433
So, uh...

17:22.500 --> 17:23.900
lotion me up?

17:31.700 --> 17:34.700
Thank you for meeting me.

17:34.767 --> 17:36.667
I've faced some
scary dudes on the court,

17:36.733 --> 17:39.367
but you might be the most
intimidating person

17:39.433 --> 17:40.833
I've come across yet.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.733
You shouldn't be
intimidated.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.967
You wouldn't be here
if Pete didn't put

17:45.067 --> 17:46.467
a whole lot of stock
in your opinion.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.567
(sighs)

17:51.567 --> 17:54.167
I don't just wanna
buy the Devils.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.767
I want to take us
back to where we were.

17:56.833 --> 18:01.067
This team has been
put through it,

18:01.100 --> 18:02.833
and I wanna make it
great again.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.300
You keep saying "I".

18:05.367 --> 18:07.633
You mean "we".

18:07.700 --> 18:09.733
(sighs)

18:09.800 --> 18:11.600
I know you and Jelena
have had difficulties.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.067
I don't think you do.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.867
I just have
one question.

18:20.767 --> 18:24.767
Why is someone as noble
as Terrence Wall

18:24.833 --> 18:27.967
with someone
as vicious as Jelena Howard?

18:32.133 --> 18:33.733
The Jelena I know

18:33.800 --> 18:38.200
is different from the one
that most people know.

18:38.267 --> 18:42.900
My Jelena is a woman
of... unbelievable strength.

18:44.233 --> 18:47.233
Someone who's been through
hell and back in her life.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.833
She's leant me that strength.

18:50.900 --> 18:54.067
When I was ready
to give up on myself,

18:54.100 --> 18:58.533
she used her damage
to heal mine.

18:58.600 --> 19:03.667
And for that...
I will always be grateful.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.567
(Lionel)
You heard right,
no expense spared.

19:11.633 --> 19:13.800
And that includes the dance.

19:13.867 --> 19:15.333
Here to pull
the lottery numbers

19:15.400 --> 19:17.867
and answer a few questions
about the dance,

19:17.933 --> 19:21.633
please welcome
all-star Ahsha Hayes.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.967
(applause)

19:25.833 --> 19:27.633
Congratulations on
getting this dance.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.967
What can we expect?

19:29.067 --> 19:31.067
You'll just have
to wait and see.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.767
How's your mom doing with
Oscar's trial coming up?

19:36.400 --> 19:39.767
You can't keep
a good Devil Girl down.

19:43.733 --> 19:46.400
Ahsha, you two
were the "it" couple.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.567
What happened?

19:48.633 --> 19:51.133
Derek Roman happened.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.433
Dating him isn't easy and she
learned that the hard way.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.700
Hopefully, that wasn't
my one crack at a great woman.

19:58.767 --> 20:00.500
But if it was, I...

20:00.567 --> 20:03.533
I wouldn't change it
for anything.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.133
All right, who's ready
to give out tickets, huh?

20:05.200 --> 20:06.467
Let's do it.

20:06.533 --> 20:09.167
(applause)

20:15.833 --> 20:18.100
So?
How'd it go with Terrence?

20:18.167 --> 20:19.700
I was impressed.

20:19.767 --> 20:22.100
He's a good guy,
I see why you like him.

20:22.167 --> 20:25.167
So, you support my backing
them with the league?

20:26.300 --> 20:27.367
Not a chance in hell.

20:27.433 --> 20:29.967
Terrence is completely
whipped by Jelena.

20:30.033 --> 20:33.033
She walks on water
as far as he's concerned.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.733
And as long as those two
are together,

20:34.800 --> 20:36.600
that girl will always
be controlling things.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.267
That's something I will
never support.

20:48.300 --> 20:51.267
Are these the auditions
for "50 Shades of Kale"?

20:51.333 --> 20:54.133
Uh, "Kyle", yeah.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.733
(sighs)

21:08.700 --> 21:10.467
I'm exhausted.

21:10.533 --> 21:13.133
Writing is hard work.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.967
Yeah.

21:15.067 --> 21:18.600
So far, all we have
is "Fade in."

21:18.667 --> 21:21.067
I don't have
any love stories.

21:21.067 --> 21:23.500
Never said "I love you"
to anyone,

21:23.567 --> 21:25.833
even when I was
married to Benny.

21:25.900 --> 21:29.133
All that candy-coated garbage
is just, ugh.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.067
Yeah, I never said it
to anyone either.

21:33.767 --> 21:35.967
What do you say we just
cut and paste from "Twilight"

21:36.067 --> 21:39.100
and just change
the names?

21:40.300 --> 21:41.800
Works for me.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.500
* You're going down tonight *

21:43.567 --> 21:47.467
* Sex, sex, sex, sex
you make me feel *

21:47.533 --> 21:49.200
* So real... *

21:49.267 --> 21:50.933
What good is having
a dad that rich

21:51.067 --> 21:52.733
if you never get
to spend any of it?

21:52.800 --> 21:55.633
It wasn't his money
I was after.

21:55.700 --> 21:58.367
What I wanted,
he couldn't give me.

21:58.433 --> 22:00.867
Kind of a running theme
in my life.

22:00.933 --> 22:02.833
Seems like
you're doing okay.

22:02.900 --> 22:06.333
Does it?
Good.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.167
No, I'm doing
better, but...

22:08.233 --> 22:10.500
I still don't really
know what I'm doing.

22:10.567 --> 22:15.600
I don't have family dinners,
I don't go out with friends.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.267
I don't date.

22:18.333 --> 22:22.333
I don't do anything
normal people do.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.700
It can be... lonely.

22:25.767 --> 22:28.233
That's why your wheels
are always turning.

22:28.300 --> 22:31.967
You're strategizing
how to get what you want.

22:33.467 --> 22:38.600
You're strategizing
this date right now.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.533
I don't wanna
screw this up.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.533
Turn off
your brain, Jude.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.067
You're doing just fine.

23:03.867 --> 23:06.067
(sighs)

23:06.133 --> 23:09.633
Sloane met with Terrence
and she still said no.

23:12.067 --> 23:15.133
You have hurt the two
most important women

23:15.200 --> 23:18.967
in my life
more than once.

23:19.067 --> 23:21.533
You should know...

23:21.600 --> 23:25.100
I'm gonna be watching you
every step of the way together.

23:26.133 --> 23:29.533
You're still going
to back us?

23:29.600 --> 23:30.767
Why?

23:30.833 --> 23:32.533
Oscar's coming at Sloane

23:32.600 --> 23:35.500
and there's not much
that I can do to stop it.

23:35.567 --> 23:38.533
And whether she personally
likes it or not,

23:38.600 --> 23:41.567
this is my best way
to get the Kincades out.

23:43.433 --> 23:46.300
I'll set the meeting
with the league.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.667
**

23:56.733 --> 24:00.367
(overlapping chatter)

24:02.567 --> 24:03.933
Here we go.

24:06.067 --> 24:06.967
(man)
Whoo!

24:07.067 --> 24:09.700
(crowd cheering)

24:11.667 --> 24:14.967
Look, it's a Devil Girl.

24:15.067 --> 24:18.500
Not a Devil Girl,
the Devil Girl.

24:18.567 --> 24:20.900
Come play.
I can't, I need to...

24:20.967 --> 24:22.767
Who wants Ahsha to stay?

24:22.833 --> 24:25.167
(crowd chanting "Ahsha")

24:28.333 --> 24:31.867
What do you say?
Will you roll the dice?

24:31.933 --> 24:33.533
Okay.

24:36.267 --> 24:39.067
You want me to blow
on it for luck?

24:47.833 --> 24:51.433
**

24:57.767 --> 25:00.533
* Hypnotized
by the way you move now *

25:00.600 --> 25:02.900
* Sexy thighs, make a brother
say ooh, now *

25:02.967 --> 25:05.267
* It's better he still
ain't ready to go *

25:05.333 --> 25:08.067
* The song's over
gotta see one more *

25:08.067 --> 25:10.133
* Feels like just us
and moving *

25:10.200 --> 25:13.700
* Don't know when you're leaving
baby but I hope it's real soon *

25:13.767 --> 25:16.233
* 'Cause I know
you're coming through later *

25:16.300 --> 25:19.200
* For a private show *

25:19.267 --> 25:20.733
* I won, I've got a dancer *

25:20.800 --> 25:23.667
* I wanna watch her move
so I can romance her *

25:23.733 --> 25:27.633
* I love the way
that she make me... *

25:27.700 --> 25:30.733
* Yeah *

25:30.800 --> 25:35.067
* Ohh *

25:35.067 --> 25:40.600
* You know, you know
what I want *

25:45.167 --> 25:47.400
(Ahsha)
I have to go.

25:47.467 --> 25:49.067
It happened.

25:49.067 --> 25:50.800
I know you wanna
talk about it, or--

25:50.867 --> 25:53.600
No, no.
No conversation necessary.

25:53.667 --> 25:54.867
No pressure here.

25:54.933 --> 25:56.867
Whatever happens
next is on you.

25:56.933 --> 25:59.067
I have to tell him.
If you tell German...

25:59.067 --> 26:02.067
Please, don't say
his name.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.267
He will break up
with you.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.967
I have to go.

26:06.067 --> 26:09.833
(door opens, closes)

26:09.900 --> 26:13.800
**

26:13.867 --> 26:16.633
(chuckles)
Lionel...

26:16.700 --> 26:18.300
if you brought us
owners out here

26:18.367 --> 26:20.633
just to brag about
how much you're pouring

26:20.700 --> 26:23.100
into your first game,
come on.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.967
I'm not just throwing
cash at a game,

26:25.067 --> 26:26.400
I'm investing in
the entire season.

26:26.467 --> 26:28.800
Player development,
staff training,

26:28.867 --> 26:30.700
community relations.

26:30.767 --> 26:34.367
What's good for one team
is good for us all, am I right?

26:34.433 --> 26:38.467
Oscar would never put up
that kind of dough.

26:40.067 --> 26:42.567
I'm so much
more fun than Oscar.

26:42.633 --> 26:45.167
(phone ringing)

26:47.067 --> 26:49.067
Hey, I just heard Pete booked
a meeting with the league.

26:49.133 --> 26:51.200
Do I need to be there?

26:51.267 --> 26:54.067
You're not invited,
Terrence and Jelena are.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.600
Prepare yourself, Jude.

26:59.667 --> 27:02.100
This is about
to get ugly.

27:05.633 --> 27:08.067
I hate to grind and run,
but there's something

27:08.067 --> 27:11.067
back in L.A. that needs
my immediate attention.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.933
So, no spare toothbrush?

27:15.067 --> 27:18.900
(chuckles)
You're my second guest ever.

27:21.767 --> 27:25.233
Hey, I wanna
see you again.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.567
Meet me after
the game later?

27:27.633 --> 27:29.633
Courtside?

27:29.700 --> 27:32.400
Is-- is that cool?

27:32.467 --> 27:35.167
It's a date.

27:45.833 --> 27:48.200
How was your trip?

27:48.267 --> 27:50.300
Fine.

27:50.367 --> 27:52.267
Big game today.

27:52.333 --> 27:56.067
I was wondering if--
maybe if after,

27:56.133 --> 27:58.600
we could talk,
catch up?

28:00.333 --> 28:02.300
Sure.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.067
There are too many
good-looking guys here.

28:13.100 --> 28:16.067
Supposed to be making a bomb,
not a beefcake calendar.

28:16.100 --> 28:19.100
We need terrible actors,
but I won't have ugly ones.

28:19.167 --> 28:22.067
Kyle Hart does not
roll around with pigs.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.833
Well, not totally.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.400
Kyle.

28:25.467 --> 28:27.633
Please tell me you stocked up
on tall, dark and easy.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.233
I narrowed down
the choices.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.100
This guy went to Juilliard,

28:31.167 --> 28:32.900
this guy was in
a fast food commercial,

28:32.967 --> 28:34.833
but it was the one
that makes you cry

28:34.900 --> 28:36.500
where the father--
Raquel!

28:36.567 --> 28:39.200
Did you spend the last
two days actually casting?

28:40.500 --> 28:42.300
What else was I supposed
to be doing?

28:42.367 --> 28:43.933
Hooking up.

28:45.667 --> 28:49.533
That's not only inappropriate,
it's a lawsuit.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.367
Which one of you
would say screw a role

28:51.433 --> 28:53.500
to go out with this
hot piece right here?

28:56.267 --> 28:57.500
What's wrong with her?

28:57.567 --> 28:59.767
I didn't understand
the question.

28:59.833 --> 29:02.067
A piece of what?

29:02.067 --> 29:04.267
He's perfect.
You get the part.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.400
The rest of you get to
give her your digits.

29:06.467 --> 29:09.400
Don't call us,
she'll call you.

29:09.467 --> 29:10.767
And you will.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.700
(mouthing)
Oh my God.

29:18.067 --> 29:20.067
The dance is in
a few hours.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.967
There's supposed to be
screens and laser lights

29:22.067 --> 29:25.067
and smoke machines.
Where are they?

29:25.067 --> 29:27.067
(Jelena)
Huh.

29:27.067 --> 29:30.867
I... guess they couldn't
fit through the door.

29:30.933 --> 29:34.067
You're unbelievable.

29:34.067 --> 29:37.667
You'd put on a crappy dance
opening day?

29:37.733 --> 29:39.967
No.
I wouldn't.

29:40.067 --> 29:42.400
I hope your improv
skills are good.

29:42.467 --> 29:46.067
If you need me to step in,
just... let me know.

29:55.467 --> 29:58.100
(light knocking)

29:58.167 --> 30:00.633
Hey. You ready
to go to the game?

30:00.700 --> 30:03.067
Almost.

30:04.167 --> 30:06.067
This was left
outside my door.

30:06.133 --> 30:09.133
I don't know
what it means.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.500
I know what it means.

30:11.567 --> 30:13.267
It means I can't
work for you anymore.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.633
I don't understand.

30:14.700 --> 30:18.633
This is my daughter
Rausse at pre-school.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.733
Oscar knows how to get
to her when I'm not around.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.267
Oh, Patrick.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.200
I underestimated
your situation

30:25.267 --> 30:27.100
and how far he would go.

30:27.167 --> 30:29.233
You don't need me,
you need the police.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.433
They should have you under
protective custody.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.933
Leave my home?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.100
I wish I had
a better suggestion.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.733
Thanks for taking this leap
with us, it means a lot.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.200
You ready?
We're ready.

30:46.167 --> 30:48.433
Ha, did we miss
the meeting?

30:48.500 --> 30:50.333
Your meeting is
no longer necessary.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.633
What are you talking about?

30:52.700 --> 30:54.667
The league is
pressing pause

30:54.733 --> 30:56.000
on the sale of
the Devils.

30:56.067 --> 30:58.400
Pressing pause?
Why?

31:09.933 --> 31:11.133
Derek.

31:18.700 --> 31:20.233
Derek couldn't wait
to tell the league

31:20.300 --> 31:22.800
what a fantastic job
I was doing,

31:22.867 --> 31:26.167
and how upset he would be
if that were to change...

31:26.233 --> 31:28.200
after I filled him in on
Terrence and Jelena's plans

31:28.267 --> 31:30.067
for the future.

31:30.133 --> 31:32.367
I did schmooze some of
the other owners in Vegas,

31:32.433 --> 31:34.300
but I think it was
Derek's star power

31:34.367 --> 31:36.500
that just put me
right over the top.

31:36.567 --> 31:39.267
What are you talking about?
"Plans for the future?"

31:41.100 --> 31:43.167
You should really have
a conversation

31:43.233 --> 31:46.100
with the people
you align yourself with?

31:46.167 --> 31:48.633
When did you become this?

31:48.700 --> 31:53.267
Someone who takes pleasure
in harming other people?

31:53.333 --> 31:57.267
That wasn't the Lionel
that I fell in love with.

31:57.333 --> 32:00.700
I had no idea
I hurt you this badly.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.567
You're right.

32:05.300 --> 32:08.433
You changed me.

32:08.500 --> 32:11.800
You made me into
this angry person

32:11.867 --> 32:15.400
who just wants to hurt people
the way that you hurt me.

32:17.633 --> 32:19.133
(sighs)

32:22.200 --> 32:24.933
Get over yourself, Pete.

32:25.067 --> 32:26.567
You're not
that special.

32:31.767 --> 32:33.300
See you at the game.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.700
(horn honking)

32:51.400 --> 32:53.500
(tires screeching,
car crashing)

32:55.733 --> 32:58.700
(Lionel)
Thank you, Devils Nation.
It'll be a great season.

32:58.767 --> 33:01.367
**

33:08.400 --> 33:11.633
How the hell did Derek
find out about our deal?

33:11.700 --> 33:13.433
How do you think?

33:15.533 --> 33:18.567
You had a chance
to get rid of him.

33:18.633 --> 33:22.400
Maybe it wasn't Derek
I was trying to get rid of.

33:24.067 --> 33:25.800
Payback's a bitch.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.867
(cheering and applause)

33:32.667 --> 33:33.800
Let me explain.

33:33.867 --> 33:36.533
Rot on the bench.

33:39.133 --> 33:42.867
(man)
And now, welcome
the L.A. Devil Girls!

33:42.933 --> 33:45.867
It's the Devil Girls'
first dance of the season

33:45.933 --> 33:49.433
choreographed by Ahsha Hayes.

34:03.300 --> 34:07.733
**

36:01.433 --> 36:03.433
(cheering and applause)

36:07.800 --> 36:09.967
(chuckles)
You're not gonna stay

36:10.067 --> 36:11.400
for the second half?

36:11.467 --> 36:13.067
What kind of
agent are you?

36:13.133 --> 36:14.933
I need to disappear.

36:15.067 --> 36:17.100
I'm supposed to meet Jude
courtside after the game,

36:17.167 --> 36:19.133
and that's not
gonna happen.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.633
This feels a bit more
personal than professional.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.133
(chuckles)

36:25.200 --> 36:27.800
I had sex with Jude.

36:27.867 --> 36:29.233
Oh, yeah?

36:29.300 --> 36:31.067
He's hot.

36:31.067 --> 36:34.567
And the body he is hiding
underneath that suit...

36:34.633 --> 36:36.433
I've been dying
to hit that for like a year.

36:36.500 --> 36:41.100
But Jesus, is he needy
and neurotic!

36:41.167 --> 36:44.833
Oscar wrecked him for life,
and he's totally undateable.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.767
But Jude's used to
disappointment.

36:46.833 --> 36:48.400
He'll be fine.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.067
Catch you later.

36:55.433 --> 36:56.833
Sloane, what--

36:56.900 --> 36:58.767
I was trying to reach you,
but you were too busy

36:58.833 --> 37:00.667
going behind my back
with Jelena and Terrence.

37:00.733 --> 37:02.067
I was trying to reach you

37:02.133 --> 37:03.833
because I had a difficult
decision to make,

37:03.900 --> 37:05.300
and I had to make
that decision alone.

37:05.367 --> 37:06.600
What are you
talking about?

37:06.667 --> 37:08.067
I'm going into
protective custody.

37:08.133 --> 37:11.067
Until the trial,
that's where I'll be.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.133
Sloane?
Sloane?

37:15.967 --> 37:17.533
(man)
The Devils are down by three

37:17.600 --> 37:18.900
with seconds left
in regulation.

37:18.967 --> 37:21.900
Zero's got it,
takes it to the hoop!

37:21.967 --> 37:23.500
The Devils are down
by one now.

37:23.567 --> 37:25.733
Oh, Roman steals
the inbound pass!

37:25.800 --> 37:27.100
There's a jumper
for the game!

37:27.167 --> 37:29.467
(buzzer, cheering)
Oh, Roman drains it!

37:29.533 --> 37:32.100
Wow, at the buzzer,
the Devils win!

37:32.167 --> 37:33.800
What a game!

37:34.933 --> 37:36.667
I haven't seen German.
Have you?

37:36.733 --> 37:39.067
No, he wasn't
on the bench.

37:40.533 --> 37:41.733
Hey, have you
seen German?

37:41.800 --> 37:43.767
You don't know?
Know what?

37:43.833 --> 37:45.300
He was in a car accident.

37:45.367 --> 37:46.400
I just heard that
they brought--

37:46.467 --> 37:48.733
Oh, I have to go!

37:50.700 --> 37:53.433
(music playing,
applause)

38:06.700 --> 38:09.633
Can't talk now,
I'm meeting someone.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.500
Lucas isn't coming.

38:14.067 --> 38:15.833
Why not?

38:17.533 --> 38:19.633
'Cause I told him
not to.

38:19.700 --> 38:22.667
* Ain't never gonna stop *

38:22.733 --> 38:26.067
* Until we make it
to the top *

38:26.100 --> 38:29.367
* Nobody gonna hold me
down, down, down *

38:29.433 --> 38:31.067
* We got it going on *

38:31.133 --> 38:33.933
* It's been
way too long *

38:34.067 --> 38:36.733
* We got way too strong *

38:36.800 --> 38:40.533
* Nobody gonna hold me
down, down, down *

38:40.600 --> 38:42.567
* We got it going on *

38:49.133 --> 38:50.567
Oh, Jesus.

38:53.633 --> 38:56.733
My car is totaled.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.267
I was driving
to the game.

39:00.333 --> 39:02.767
But I was so tired.

39:04.233 --> 39:07.467
I ran a red light.

39:07.533 --> 39:09.633
And the next thing
I knew...

39:09.700 --> 39:11.367
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

39:11.433 --> 39:12.967
German, you've been
so stressed.

39:15.900 --> 39:20.400
It's not just the game,
it's-- there's other stress.

39:20.467 --> 39:22.833
(sighs)
You're not an idiot,

39:22.900 --> 39:26.167
of course you picked up
on it.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.067
I'm so sorry.

39:29.967 --> 39:32.267
This is what I've been wanting
to talk to you about, tell you.

39:32.333 --> 39:34.133
Ahsha, I've been
so messed up.

39:36.633 --> 39:38.967
For months.

39:41.100 --> 39:43.533
Months?

39:43.600 --> 39:45.833
Ahsha...

39:47.733 --> 39:49.600
I killed Olivia.

39:56.933 --> 39:58.533
Next time on "Hit the Floor"...

39:58.600 --> 40:01.233
German, you didn't
kill Olivia.

40:01.300 --> 40:04.000
She said she'd tell everyone.
I couldn't let her.

40:04.067 --> 40:06.100
Since I can't trust
anyone on the outside,

40:06.167 --> 40:08.500
this is the safest
place for me.
When can I come back?

40:08.567 --> 40:10.400
Maybe you shouldn't
come back for a while.

40:10.467 --> 40:13.167
You want my statement?

40:13.233 --> 40:15.000
That's my statement.

40:15.067 --> 40:17.233
If making Lionel
suffer is your goal,

40:17.300 --> 40:18.900
you couldn't have picked
a better partner.

40:18.967 --> 40:21.533
The arena is closed.
Have everyone out in 30

40:21.600 --> 40:24.133
or I call the police.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.133
The bitch needs to go.
