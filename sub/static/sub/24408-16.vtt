Kelsey: Sorry you didn't get pics you wanted.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Eh, it's okay.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm just glad everyone is all right, thanks to you.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Pfft, nah. I was just following my warrior instincts.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Seriously, though, your instincts

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
were right on the money.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
