00:00.001 --> 00:03.635
WALTER: <i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...
Whitehull Hospital

00:03.637 --> 00:06.438
is selling the naming rights
to its new pediatric ward.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.724
If I can earn
enough money,

00:08.725 --> 00:11.009
hopefully, it'll be named the
Megan Dodd Pediatric Care Ward.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.611
I'll be on<i> Price Is Right </i>
next week,

00:12.613 --> 00:15.080
and I'm gonna be fully prepared.

00:15.082 --> 00:19.351
(audience cheering,
theme music playing)

00:19.353 --> 00:22.254
Patricia Brewster!
Come on down!

00:22.256 --> 00:24.723
(screaming)

00:24.725 --> 00:27.059
That's one of the four.
My odds for being selected

00:27.061 --> 00:28.527
have dropped precipitously.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.695
You mirrored
the breathing pattern

00:29.697 --> 00:31.030
of the contestant screener.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.464
You're wearing a silly T-shirt.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.066
They know you'll be
a fun contestant.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.234
Horatio Pepper!

00:35.236 --> 00:38.771
Come on down!

00:38.773 --> 00:41.206
Man.
Now I'm down to a .7% chance.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.341
Actually,

00:42.343 --> 00:43.359
it's less than that if they want

00:43.360 --> 00:44.376
an equal number
of men and women.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.744
Stop it.
You're making him nervous.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.047
He's sweating a lot,
like he swam here.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.615
Hey!
Murray Miller!

00:49.617 --> 00:52.618
Come on down!

00:52.620 --> 00:55.087
Oh, man, now they've
selected two men. No, no.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.623
I-I know this show. They don't
always do equal genders.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.625
I can't believe I studied
every supermarket circular

00:59.627 --> 01:02.127
within a 50-mile radius
for a month.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.129
I'm never gonna get the money
for Megan's tribute.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.397
Sylvester Dodd!

01:05.399 --> 01:08.367
Come on down!
Me! I knew it! I knew it!

01:08.369 --> 01:09.601
(laughs)

01:09.603 --> 01:10.736
(giggling)
That's great!

01:10.738 --> 01:12.104
You are the first
four contestants

01:12.106 --> 01:14.273
on<i> The Price Is Right!</i>

01:14.275 --> 01:15.507
And now...

01:15.509 --> 01:17.643
(shouting happily)
here's your host,

01:17.645 --> 01:19.745
Drew Carey!

01:19.747 --> 01:22.347
(audience cheering)

01:24.318 --> 01:25.617
CAREY:
What's up, everybody?

01:25.619 --> 01:27.119
Welcome to the show.
How you feeling? Good?

01:27.121 --> 01:28.787
Yeah!
It's gonna be a great hour.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.912
Let's get it started
with the first prize

01:30.913 --> 01:33.036
up for bids today
on<i> The Price Is Right!</i>

01:33.037 --> 01:35.160
GEORGE GRAY: Drew, we're gonna kick
things off with a fun Ping-Pong table

01:35.162 --> 01:36.495
from Craftgames!

01:36.497 --> 01:38.530
$950!

01:38.532 --> 01:41.300
Uh, usually George finishes
the prize before you bid.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.402
No need. That is
a Craftgames Pro Tournament

01:43.404 --> 01:46.338
Series 200,
with aluminum alloy legs,

01:46.340 --> 01:47.606
push-button retractable net,

01:47.608 --> 01:50.309
and dual folding capabilities
for easy storage.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.344
$950.
So, Sylvester,

01:52.346 --> 01:53.712
what's your bid? Just kidding.
We're moving on.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.314
Murray, what
do you say?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.266
Ten to one Sly nails it.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.217
No way. I saw you guys studying
the sports catalog.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.453
Small wager then? Been
wagering a lot lately.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.189
Yeah, I bet when I'm manic.
I'm manically in love with you.

02:04.191 --> 02:05.757
I'm aware of the pathology.
I'm in control.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.726
You want some of
this action or no?

02:07.728 --> 02:10.829
(bell dinging) Somebody got it right
on the nose and gets an extra $500

02:10.831 --> 02:13.298
right out of my pocket!

02:13.300 --> 02:14.733
Actual retail price

02:14.735 --> 02:16.201
is...

02:16.203 --> 02:17.669
$950! Sylvester!

02:17.671 --> 02:18.837
(bell dinging rapidly,
audience cheering)

02:18.839 --> 02:20.906
Yay! Yay! That's my friend!

02:20.908 --> 02:23.175
(audience cheering)

02:27.181 --> 02:28.614
Very good work.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.215
Here's your $500.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.750
Man, you were sure
about that $950.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.552
I'm certain of all facts.

02:34.421 --> 02:35.320
All right.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.472
I got a fact for you.

02:36.473 --> 02:37.623
George, let him know!
Sylvester,

02:37.625 --> 02:40.292
you've got a chance to win up to

02:40.294 --> 02:44.229
$100,000!

02:44.231 --> 02:45.898
Yeah, Sly! GEORGE: Because
you're gonna be playing

02:45.900 --> 02:48.433
"Pay the Rent"!

02:48.435 --> 02:49.434
All right.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.236
(cheering)

02:51.238 --> 02:52.404
What you're gonna do
is you're gonna take

02:52.405 --> 02:53.571
these grocery items,
put 'em in your house.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.706
The items on
the second floor

02:54.708 --> 02:56.575
have to be
more expensive

02:56.576 --> 02:58.443
than the one in the mailbox...
Every floor needs

02:58.445 --> 03:01.380
to cost more than the level
below it. Got it. Okay.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.915
Mailbox, first floor,
first floor, second floor,

03:02.917 --> 03:05.250
second floor, attic. Uh,
we should really, uh,

03:05.252 --> 03:06.718
tell you about the products first.
Uh, no need.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.820
I'm going straight
for the $100,000.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.522
(cheering)

03:10.524 --> 03:11.924
Mailbox, first floor,
first floor,

03:11.926 --> 03:14.426
second floor,
second floor, attic.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.803
Ask Amber. She'll tell you.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.406
Show-show the prices.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.840
That's not normally
how we do it.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.677
Uh... Is Sylvester right?

03:31.679 --> 03:33.745
GEORGE:
Holy cow!

03:33.747 --> 03:36.782
$100,000!

03:36.784 --> 03:40.219
(cheering,
theme music playing)

03:43.958 --> 03:45.424
Congratulations!

03:45.426 --> 03:46.959
100,000 bucks!
Sylvester won!

03:46.961 --> 03:49.228
(cheering)

03:54.001 --> 03:55.651
Morning, big winner.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.302
Whoa. You doing
an inventory on your booty?

03:57.304 --> 03:59.605
If I can get just 90%
of the retail price

03:59.607 --> 04:02.474
for my showcase prizes,
plus the 100K in cash,

04:02.476 --> 04:06.378
then I will be halfway to naming
the Megan Dodd Pediatric Wing.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.313
Year's supply of motor oil;
new bedroom set...

04:08.315 --> 04:09.581
Is this Egyptian cotton?

04:09.583 --> 04:10.716
20 bucks I can guess
the thread count.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.985
1,500. Is it 1,500?

04:12.987 --> 04:14.820
Pathetic.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.455
Pathetic?

04:16.457 --> 04:18.957
That's a little harsh
to say to your hunk.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.892
Question is, hunk of what?

04:20.894 --> 04:23.895
More time I spend with him,
the more racing forms

04:23.897 --> 04:25.664
and bookie slips I find
all over his apartment.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.399
And this is news to you?

04:27.401 --> 04:28.967
The extent of it is.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.336
Look, you're learning your way
through a new romance.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.572
Before Toby, what was
your longest relationship?

04:33.574 --> 04:35.941
I had an orbital sander
for nine years.

04:38.279 --> 04:40.012
Hi.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.415
Yeah, I'm lookin'
for Cabe Gallo.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.783
Um, okay. Could we
tell him who's asking?

04:44.785 --> 04:45.851
I'm a friend.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.353
WALTER:
Yeah, we're just

04:47.354 --> 04:48.854
looking for a name.
MAN: And what are you,

04:48.856 --> 04:49.855
the Census Bureau?

04:49.857 --> 04:51.290
TOBY:
I know what he wants.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.292
We're not on the job.
So what's your play?

04:53.294 --> 04:54.493
SYLVESTER:
Not on the job?

04:54.495 --> 04:55.594
But we work here.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.862
Means we're not cops.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.030
CABE:
Mick Doherty!

04:58.032 --> 04:59.564
MICK:
Gallo.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.401
Are you still usin'
that Crisco in your hair?

05:02.403 --> 05:03.602
Well, I didn't recognize you
in clothes without stripes

05:03.604 --> 05:04.870
and a number across your chest.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.571
What's it been,

05:06.573 --> 05:08.407
ten years?
MICK: At least.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.009
Got a minute to talk to me?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.577
Yeah.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.479
Follow me.

05:17.851 --> 05:18.917
(exhales)

05:21.722 --> 05:23.021
I'm in trouble.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.806
Yeah, no kiddin'.

05:24.807 --> 05:26.590
Why else would you risk being
this close to law enforcement?

05:26.593 --> 05:28.327
Are you in danger?

05:28.329 --> 05:29.695
How's Lorraine?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.730
Well, sadly, Lorraine always
liked a straight flush

05:31.732 --> 05:32.998
more than a crooked con.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.700
Had to let it end.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.868
But I'm in deep.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.905
That deal you set up with me and
the feds will not protect me.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.039
I need help.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.607
I want to make a trade.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.675
A trade?
Yeah.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.477
With what?
Intel.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.413
I got dirt on some
real bad players.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.349
I give up what I know,

05:50.351 --> 05:51.616
I want out.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.018
Out of the country.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.853
I just want to be gone
and be safe.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.889
Yeah, I'd love to help you...

05:57.891 --> 06:00.425
but you're gonna have to give
the info to the Feds.

06:00.427 --> 06:01.660
I'm with Homeland now.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.894
Yeah, I know.
I heard.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.630
I read about you
and your little genius team.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.699
One I can't risk getting stuck
in any quicksand.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.968
I'm not dealin' dirty
here, Cabe.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.971
Lots of people--
innocent people--

06:12.973 --> 06:14.573
could get killed.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.707
Killed? How?

06:15.709 --> 06:16.842
Keep your voice down.

06:16.844 --> 06:17.843
We don't want anybody
hearing this.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.578
You kidding me?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.584
We only heard all of it.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.487
Mick and I are
from the same block

06:28.489 --> 06:29.554
in Brooklyn.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.722
Little League,

06:30.724 --> 06:32.057
made our confirmations
together...

06:32.059 --> 06:33.158
Stillwell Avenue.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.559
TOBY:
Stillwell Avenue?

06:34.561 --> 06:35.861
You know The Hustle?

06:35.863 --> 06:37.162
He ran a card game out
of a bookmobile?  I did.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.063
He's dead.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.731
CABE:
Anyway, 15 years ago,

06:39.733 --> 06:41.666
Mick makes his way
out to Los Angeles.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.868
Was gettin' too hot in New York.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.169
But it's hotter in L.A.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.570
He means the cops
were onto him.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.905
And they eventually
caught me,

06:46.907 --> 06:48.507
even out here,

06:48.509 --> 06:50.909
but luckily, Cabe stepped up.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.445
Well, all I did was help Mick
cut a deal with the Feds...

06:53.447 --> 06:55.180
So, like, in the movies.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.449
He was a rat.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.050
Rats turn on their friends, kid.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.420
I help prevent things

07:01.422 --> 07:03.121
where people could get hurt.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.524
Yes, you mentioned
people might get killed.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.826
Exactly.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.127
So why not tell your Fed pals
like you have been doing?

07:08.128 --> 07:09.428
'Cause I'm onto something big.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.731
I give it to the Feds,
they'll make me testify.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.699
They won't honor my deal
with them.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.251
So you want to trade on data

07:16.252 --> 07:17.802
that might or might not affect
the safety of others

07:17.805 --> 07:20.505
so you can get something
from the government?

07:20.507 --> 07:22.674
This seems shady...
this is not what we do.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.576
She's right. It isn't.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.445
So you're gonna have
to download the intel to me

07:26.447 --> 07:28.447
and trust me
that I can help you.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.748
All right.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.716
I've been running with a guy

07:31.718 --> 07:33.452
named Patrick Grady
for a while now.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.021
He's into import/export
of high-end vehicles.

07:36.023 --> 07:36.888
Smuggler.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.890
On the nose.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.225
<i> If you're one of</i>
<i> the heavy hitters</i>

07:40.227 --> 07:41.827
<i> who buys classic Lambos</i>
<i> and Ferraris,</i>

07:41.829 --> 07:44.029
<i> you've got Customs</i>
<i> on your payroll,</i>

07:44.031 --> 07:45.964
<i> so you don't have</i>
<i> to wait for your toys.</i>

07:45.966 --> 07:49.000
<i>Well, Grady gets their cars all</i>
<i> ready for 'em, ships 'em out,</i>

07:49.002 --> 07:51.169
<i> but not before stashing away</i>

07:51.171 --> 07:52.771
<i> whatever he wants to get</i>
<i> in or out of the country.</i>

07:52.773 --> 07:55.674
<i> Drugs, jewels, art...</i>

07:55.676 --> 07:57.776
How do stolen goods
relate to life and death?

07:57.778 --> 08:00.045
I was in the basement
of one of Grady's warehouses.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.780
I overheard a phone call

08:01.782 --> 08:04.783
between he and a person
with a Spanish accent.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.852
A government official in Balio.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.187
Central American
nation of nine million;

08:09.189 --> 08:11.056
settled by Spain
in the 16th century...

08:11.058 --> 08:12.958
<i>No mas</i> oral report,<i> por favor. </i>
Go on.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.759
MICK: Well, whoever
Grady was talkin' to

08:14.761 --> 08:16.261
was sweatin' the details:

08:16.263 --> 08:18.997
It's a dangerous shipment;
can't be exposed to light;

08:18.999 --> 08:20.065
has to be kept

08:20.067 --> 08:21.900
above minus 30,
below 60 degrees.

08:21.902 --> 08:25.136
That fits all the criteria
of a biological agent.

08:25.138 --> 08:28.607
Someone also used the phrase
"toxic biotic materials."

08:29.977 --> 08:30.976
What else did you hear?

08:30.978 --> 08:33.645
Payday: $5 million.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.947
Whoever wants this shipped
to Balio wants it bad.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.082
WALTER:
What could we do?

08:37.084 --> 08:38.683
It's not like we can just walk

08:38.685 --> 08:40.785
into a criminal enterprise
and start looking around.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.988
Why not?
Import/export businesses

08:42.990 --> 08:44.623
are software dependent--

08:44.625 --> 08:46.992
setting up shipping rates,
docking schedules,

08:46.994 --> 08:48.960
customs...

08:48.962 --> 08:50.529
If Grady trusts you,
just tell him you know a company

08:50.531 --> 08:51.796
that can streamline his system.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.098
Yeah, and once
my guys are in,

08:53.100 --> 08:56.101
they can look around for
any evidence of a bioweapon,

08:56.103 --> 08:59.004
and if so,
when and how it was shipped.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.205
WALTER:
"If so"?

09:00.207 --> 09:02.107
Cabe...

09:02.109 --> 09:04.709
since when did we start
getting involved in speculation?

09:04.711 --> 09:07.979
Hey, Mick, give us a minute.

09:10.951 --> 09:11.983
Well, now, what's the story?

09:11.985 --> 09:13.407
'Cause if anyone else

09:13.408 --> 09:14.830
came in here with
a half-baked theory like his,

09:14.831 --> 09:16.253
you'd ask for concrete evidence
before getting us involved.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.556
We deserve the truth, Cabe.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.860
When I was 13 years old,

09:21.862 --> 09:24.195
I was surrounded
by a bunch of older kids

09:24.197 --> 09:25.597
when I was carrying the payroll

09:25.599 --> 09:26.965
for my granddaddy's
masonry company.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.867
I was done for.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.135
Mick showed up out of nowhere

09:30.137 --> 09:31.336
and knocked
the head kid on his ass.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.138
Kid lost an eye.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.140
Mick goes to juvie,
gets out when he's 18,

09:35.142 --> 09:36.675
the cement's dry--
he's a criminal.

09:36.677 --> 09:37.676
All because he helped me.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.144
WALTER:
Okay, no offense,

09:39.146 --> 09:40.211
but do we need to get involved

09:40.213 --> 09:41.813
with some hood
just because

09:41.815 --> 09:42.981
you owe him a childhood debt?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.149
Mick's always been
straight with me.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.617
What if he's right?

09:45.619 --> 09:47.252
What if some smuggler's

09:47.254 --> 09:49.154
gonna get a big payday

09:49.156 --> 09:50.822
by shipping something
incredibly dangerous?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.824
And we knew and we did nothing.

09:52.826 --> 09:53.959
That would be bad.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.760
All right, fine.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.762
Between me, Happy and Toby

09:57.764 --> 09:59.230
we cover computers, cars

09:59.232 --> 10:00.966
and the psychology
of criminals.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.768
So we quickly go in,
search his hard drive,

10:03.770 --> 10:06.638
see if we can find some shipping
data that supports Mick's story.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.640
Now, if we do,
we call the authorities,

10:08.642 --> 10:10.075
and if we don't...

10:10.077 --> 10:12.077
too bad for Mick.
We're out.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.245
Fair enough.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.382
Once Mick gives
us the okay,

10:17.384 --> 10:19.184
you're gonna have
to play it cool in there.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.319
We're posing as computer techs.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.787
I think we can handle it.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.255
I'm sure we can
outsmart some thugs.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.057
Don't underestimate thugs.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.059
I once slipped some dice
into a crap game

10:28.061 --> 10:29.661
that may or may not
have been loaded,

10:29.662 --> 10:31.262
and now these three fingers
don't bend the way they used to.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.665
Lovely.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.001
Hey, that's a story
with a happy ending.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.902
I got a million
that actually turn out bad.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.070
Speaking of criminals,

10:39.072 --> 10:40.338
did one of you guys
take two quarts

10:40.340 --> 10:42.107
of my game show motor oil?

10:42.109 --> 10:43.808
Yes, I'm putting it
on my salad right now.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.210
Look at Mick's heap.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.911
It's leaking oil

10:46.913 --> 10:48.947
like a sieve. Nice.
He's in our garage

10:48.949 --> 10:51.216
for ten minutes
and he steals from us.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.652
It's two cans of oil,
for Pete's sake.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.953
Mick's a good guy,

10:54.955 --> 10:56.821
he's just been dealt
a bad hand.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.923
Any one of us could
be a lost Picasso.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.692
What, now?

11:00.694 --> 11:02.227
It's an expression.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.229
I know what it means--
something with unseen value

11:04.231 --> 11:05.363
that's wasted.
It's a bit of an artsy-fartsy

11:05.365 --> 11:06.965
analogy for you.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.733
It's a turn of phrase.
I just said it.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.036
Your psyche chose
art for a reason.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.937
No one "just says" anything.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.973
Shut up.
Why did I just say that?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.141
WALTER:
Oh.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.042
Here he comes.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.945
Okay, it's all set.
Spoke to Grady.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.347
You just
walk right on in.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.748
You're not coming with us?

11:23.750 --> 11:25.383
I think it's best I be long gone

11:25.385 --> 11:27.352
when you guys bust in,
so I can keep breathing.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.987
That's a good idea.
You need to get some distance

11:28.989 --> 11:30.255
from this thing.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.424
I'll stay out here in case
things get hinky.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.125
Yeah, don't worry, Cabe's
always right on the Monet.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.360
I-I mean money.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.462
What's with you and art?

11:37.464 --> 11:38.730
Get out.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.034
(bell dings)
Hey.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.137
We're meeting Mr. Grady?

11:46.139 --> 11:48.306
Oh, Mick's people?

11:48.308 --> 11:49.741
Yeah.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.142
Follow me.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.850
Wait right here.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.351
Right.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.759
(whispers):
I got a bad feeling about this.

12:07.761 --> 12:10.095
Why?

12:10.097 --> 12:11.763
That's why.

12:11.765 --> 12:12.964
(grunting)

12:24.478 --> 12:28.213
When I said I had a million
stories that turned out bad,

12:28.215 --> 12:29.470
they all started out like this.

12:29.471 --> 12:30.726
PAIGE:
Walter, what is going on?

12:30.727 --> 12:31.982
They won't talk until
they know it's safe.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.485
Or else they risk giving away
they've got comms in.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.221
(engine revs, tires screech)

12:37.824 --> 12:39.991
(car horn honks)

12:39.993 --> 12:41.893
What the hell did you just do?!
Nothing!

12:41.895 --> 12:42.994
I told Grady's guys
they were cool.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.129
They said send them in.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.263
I got to go after them.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.098
No, no, no.
We got to let this play out.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.399
He wants to see
if law enforcement's

12:48.401 --> 12:50.168
gonna follow these guys.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.770
If you trail them and get made,

12:51.772 --> 12:54.038
they're dead, pal.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.381
Wait here. TOBY: Last
time he said that,

13:03.383 --> 13:04.949
we got bags over our heads.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.990
Pantera.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.058
Aventador.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.027
Sting Ray.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.930
HAPPY:
That Pantera's the sexiest thing

13:18.932 --> 13:20.064
I've ever seen.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.267
<i> Second</i> sexiest.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.902
Sorry about the black ops.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.471
I've got millions
in cars here.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.306
Best to keep the
location under wraps.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.307
That's logical.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.441
We understand.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.943
Mick says you can
upgrade my system?

13:31.945 --> 13:34.345
Get my cars in and out
of the country faster?

13:34.347 --> 13:36.414
(engine roaring in distance)

13:36.415 --> 13:38.482
From the sound of it, your cars
are already moving pretty fast.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.953
Yeah, well, my boys, they gotta
test out their handiwork, no?

13:41.955 --> 13:44.088
WALTER: To answer
your question--

13:44.090 --> 13:45.990
with the right software,
we can exploit

13:45.992 --> 13:47.926
inefficiencies
in the Customs' protocol.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.427
And if we can see
your hard drives,

13:49.429 --> 13:51.296
then we can start to run
an analysis for you.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.564
Come with me.

13:52.566 --> 13:55.233
Okay.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.236
Okay, Grady's got warehouses
all over the place.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.505
But the only one with room
to drag race is in Pedro.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.040
I know the place.
Follow me.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.842
Hey, if you're
playing a game with me,

14:03.844 --> 14:05.243
it's a bad idea.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.444
I wouldn't do that to you.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.515
You want to find
your friends or not?

14:12.118 --> 14:14.002
PAIGE:
<i> I am not comfortable</i>

14:14.003 --> 14:15.887
with our guys trapped
with some hoods without Cabe.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.322
Cabe is on his way
to them now.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.257
And you're not worried?

14:19.259 --> 14:21.125
I am, that's why
I'm channeling

14:21.127 --> 14:23.027
my nervous energy into
my research-- look here.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.029
Balio, the country
that Mick says

14:25.031 --> 14:27.398
might be involved with
this biological agent,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.500
is a Central American
government in turmoil.

14:29.502 --> 14:33.171
Many groups are disenfranchised
by a dictatorial regime, but

14:33.173 --> 14:35.874
it seems the administration's
biggest threat

14:35.876 --> 14:37.609
comes from the indigenous
Aztec population

14:37.611 --> 14:39.544
that is starting to gain
international support.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.012
Support for what?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.414
Getting confiscated land back,

14:42.415 --> 14:43.815
equal protection under
the law-- you name it.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.216
They only make up five
percent of the population,

14:45.218 --> 14:47.085
but they are starting
to upset the apple cart.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.087
What the hell does this have
to do with a possible bioweapon?

14:49.089 --> 14:50.555
I have no idea.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.022
But that is why our
friends are sneaking

14:52.025 --> 14:54.058
around an export shop,
investigating the theory

14:54.060 --> 14:56.461
of a serial felon
from Cabe's childhood.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.062
Thanks for letting
us look around.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.898
A diagnostic
shouldn't take long.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.966
All right, I'll leave you to it.
Okay.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.539
Okay, we're alone.
Walter's checking the database

15:08.541 --> 15:11.476
for any bio-hazardous
shipping shenanigans.

15:11.478 --> 15:12.827
So far, the odds are low.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.177
Basic search is
turning up nothing.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.647
I'll still keep looking.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.248
You know, my Bronx bookie,
Albino Pete,

15:17.250 --> 15:19.150
he kept his bets
on the backs of candy wrappers,

15:19.152 --> 15:21.019
hidden in the seat
of his daughter's tricycle.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.186
Another winner.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.588
Well, my point is

15:23.590 --> 15:25.156
that there's
a chance Shady Grady

15:25.158 --> 15:27.392
keeps all his records
non-digital as well.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.593
Happy and I should poke around.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.095
CABE: Be careful!

15:31.097 --> 15:32.563
These guys catch you
sticking your nose

15:32.565 --> 15:34.232
where it doesn't belong,
they cut it off.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.467
How we gonna sneak around
with these guys around?

15:36.469 --> 15:38.136
Guys like Grady live
by their machismo.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.537
They can't lose face.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.172
We can get them all
outside in about a minute.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.941
Just follow my lead.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.008
Excuse me?

15:44.010 --> 15:45.710
Mr. Grady? Happy and I,

15:45.712 --> 15:47.245
we don't involved
with the computer work

15:47.247 --> 15:49.080
until Walter's ready
for the software installation.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.082
Do you mind
if we check out these rides?

15:51.084 --> 15:52.317
Yeah, we're car nuts.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.585
Look around.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.221
If you have a million five, feel
free to pick up a starter model.

15:57.223 --> 15:59.624
Oh, speaking of the value
of these cars,

15:59.626 --> 16:02.527
I have to say, letting your
employees drag race them

16:02.529 --> 16:05.096
is quite irresponsible.
Excuse me?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.497
It's not like any of these guys
are gonna win Le Mans.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.499
I don't let them drive
the eight-figure models.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.201
And my guys are good drivers.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.236
I'm sure they're competent,
but, see, we're scientists.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.539
We know mechanics
and wind resistance,

16:14.541 --> 16:16.240
angles and vectors,

16:16.242 --> 16:17.575
our friend Walter,
he's done pretty well

16:17.577 --> 16:18.977
in a few street races himself.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.245
I can smell
a degenerate gambler

16:21.247 --> 16:22.613
a mile away.
Hmm.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.382
You wouldn't be
setting me up

16:24.384 --> 16:25.516
for a little wager,
would you?

16:25.518 --> 16:26.684
Indeed I am.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.653
I like the action.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.121
And I like Walter

16:30.123 --> 16:31.522
over any of your guys.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.124
You win, we work for free.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.293
We win, you double our fee.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.161
What are you getting me into?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.496
What are you
getting him into?

16:38.498 --> 16:39.998
Okay, here are the rules.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.134
Ready, set...
Tommy drops the rag,

16:43.136 --> 16:44.669
down to the end marker,

16:44.671 --> 16:46.537
back to the start.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.407
Tie... goes to the house.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.775
HAPPY: You know what?
You boys can have

16:50.777 --> 16:52.710
your carburetor
measuring contest.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.445
I'm gonna go
finish up the work

16:54.447 --> 16:55.680
that Walter should be doing.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.648
PAIGE: Walter, you have
to stall this race

16:57.650 --> 16:59.417
as long as you can,
so Happy has enough time

16:59.419 --> 17:00.651
to search the records.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.487
Okay, before we race,

17:02.488 --> 17:04.322
I would like to
inspect both cars,

17:04.324 --> 17:05.523
make sure that there's

17:05.525 --> 17:07.558
no nitrous or other

17:07.560 --> 17:09.560
hidden oxygen
supply systems, yeah?

17:18.171 --> 17:19.470
Oh, damn it.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.606
Oh... damn it.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.074
I presume from
the number of "damn its"

17:23.076 --> 17:24.308
that Happy hasn't
found anything yet.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.376
Don't get in the car yet,
Walter.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.778
You need to drag this out.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.379
Sure, they're both V8's,

17:28.381 --> 17:30.314
but how do I know
that you haven't

17:30.316 --> 17:32.650
put fuel additives
in your car?

17:32.652 --> 17:35.286
You don't.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.321
Are we gonna do this?

17:37.323 --> 17:38.723
Sure.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.725
After you siphon fuel
from both tanks

17:40.727 --> 17:42.193
and we compare the tint.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.594
(laughs)

17:43.596 --> 17:45.296
You believe this guy?

17:45.298 --> 17:47.331
Okay, forget it.
There is nothing here.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.866
TOBY:
No, no, no, no!

17:48.867 --> 17:50.400
My instincts are screaming.
If there's a big-money shipment,

17:50.403 --> 17:52.270
these guys are gonna treat it
like a big-money bet.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.337
All details

17:53.339 --> 17:55.073
are written down
and stashed away.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.340
They're cons.
You got to think sneaky.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.842
I'm telling you

17:57.843 --> 17:59.343
there is nothing here
but cheap furniture,

17:59.345 --> 18:01.212
bad fluorescent lighting
and, uh,

18:01.214 --> 18:04.248
a lot of chipped paint
covering up old crown molding.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.418
Hold on.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.586
You find something?

18:08.588 --> 18:09.687
Maybe.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.756
This is a mid-century

18:11.758 --> 18:13.724
L.A. crap-shack warehouse,

18:13.726 --> 18:16.360
not a New England Victorian.

18:16.362 --> 18:17.795
Why would there be
crown molding?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.534
Guys, I found something.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.511
Faxes from a library in Balio.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.413
Fax instead of an e-mail,
so it can't get traced.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.881
Use a public line
from a library,

18:36.883 --> 18:38.883
so anybody could've had access.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.651
They just keep
referring to the package,

18:40.653 --> 18:43.187
how it has to be kept
in a certain temperature range.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.856
It sounds bio to me.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.358
(tires screech)

18:47.360 --> 18:48.759
Check for shipping information--

18:48.761 --> 18:50.261
where it came from,
where it's going.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.263
HAPPY:
Don't see that here.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.498
But there is an address

18:53.500 --> 18:55.566
for something
called a midnight elevator

18:55.568 --> 18:57.802
a day ago.
That's a midnight pick-up.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.537
It's 819 North Eagle Street.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.539
Now, that's close.
We'll do a drive-by.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.807
See if we find any clues there
that are useful.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.442
We will?

19:04.444 --> 19:06.444
Almost done, right now,
here-here we are.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.879
You looked at the fuel.

19:07.881 --> 19:10.414
You checked the engines.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.315
Now we race.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.550
Okay, okay.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.552
Son, Happy's still searching.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.187
So don't let
those guys back inside.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.821
I will race-- I just want
to go over the ground rules

19:17.824 --> 19:19.690
one last time.
(laughs)

19:19.692 --> 19:20.825
Let me ask you--

19:20.827 --> 19:22.760
does it hurt when you lay eggs?

19:24.564 --> 19:25.730
Are you calling me a chicken?

19:25.732 --> 19:27.165
No.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.300
A chicken would've raced by now.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.236
Walter, he's goading you.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.205
He's trying to play on your ego
to get you to do something

19:34.207 --> 19:35.506
before you're ready to do it.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.775
Oh, man, he is going to race.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.711
I have an idea.

19:40.713 --> 19:41.712
Let's race.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.481
Good idea.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.917
This place looks condemned.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.351
It's still locked up.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.220
Looks like no one's
been here for a while.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.723
No, there's fresh
footprints in this mud.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.659
Someone was definitely
here recently.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.462
No, no, no, no!

19:58.464 --> 19:59.864
Now is the time
that we call the police.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.766
So the cops can come in,
arrest Grady and his men,

20:01.768 --> 20:02.934
and they all clam up

20:02.936 --> 20:04.502
before we know where
the bio weapon may be?

20:04.504 --> 20:05.670
Bad plan.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.605
And look, the door's unlocked.

20:09.842 --> 20:10.791
That doesn't mean
we should go in.

20:10.792 --> 20:11.741
(quietly): Come on.
(quietly): Oh, Paige.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.378
CABE: Happy, doesn't this thing
need a special storage facility

20:14.380 --> 20:17.381
since it has to remain
in a specific temperature range?

20:17.383 --> 20:18.249
Yes, I am looking.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.584
(engines rev)

20:19.586 --> 20:21.619
(men shouting in distance)

20:21.621 --> 20:26.224
(revving engine)

20:26.226 --> 20:26.891
Ready!

20:26.893 --> 20:28.392
Uh, definitely not ready.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.429
(engine revving)

20:32.832 --> 20:33.965
Set!

20:35.401 --> 20:36.834
HAPPY:
Walter!

20:36.836 --> 20:38.703
I'm gonna kill you.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.571
(engine idling, rumbling)

20:57.457 --> 20:58.522
PAIGE:
Guys, this is bad.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.724
We found a makeshift lab here.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.359
Somebody bugged out quick.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.516
Oh, boy.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.268
I am looking at biohazard labels
with a genome string on it.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.671
Sly, read it aloud to Toby!

21:15.908 --> 21:20.278
T-G-C-T-C-C...

21:20.280 --> 21:23.614
T-A-T-C...

21:23.616 --> 21:27.051
C-C-G-A.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.420
Hold up! Back to the "C-C" part!

21:29.422 --> 21:30.421
Say it again!

21:30.423 --> 21:32.156
Walt, I need more time.

21:32.157 --> 21:33.890
Uh, you need to lose and
challenge the guy to a rematch.

21:33.893 --> 21:34.892
Lose?

21:34.894 --> 21:36.327
That's not gonna happen.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.463
Walt.
SYLVESTER: Okay, I'm ready.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.632
C-C-T-A-

21:41.634 --> 21:43.434
T-C-C-C-

21:43.436 --> 21:44.435
G-A.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.404
Toby, you hear what I hear?

21:46.406 --> 21:48.572
Yes, that whole string
is a common cold virus,

21:48.574 --> 21:49.840
but that C-C-T runner
in the middle,

21:49.842 --> 21:51.809
that's a mitochondrial gene,

21:51.811 --> 21:53.844
unique to people
of Mesoamerican descent.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.380
Like Aztecs found in Balio?

21:56.382 --> 21:57.882
TOBY: Yes, exactly like
the Aztecs in Balio.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.885
This weapon is designed
to spread via the common cold

22:00.887 --> 22:02.620
while attacking a specific gene

22:02.622 --> 22:04.822
that's only found in that
particular race of people.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.558
That's how the Balio regime can
take out their indigenous people

22:07.560 --> 22:09.427
without endangering
the rest of the population.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.696
They're smuggling
a genocide bomb.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.497
Told you I was telling
you the truth.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.700
And low-end smugglers
are okay with mass death?

22:15.702 --> 22:18.703
Oh, with these guys,
once they heard $5 million,

22:18.705 --> 22:20.905
all they saw was sandy beaches
and rum drinks.

22:28.548 --> 22:29.814
(groaning)

22:31.484 --> 22:32.917
Uh, Walter just won.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.051
Happy, you're out of time.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.586
They'll all be back
inside in minutes.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.122
We need to find that weapon now.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.124
Maybe I could've, but Walter
had to beat Mario Andretti

22:40.126 --> 22:41.692
instead of buying me time.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.798
(sighs anxiously)
Are they on their way in?

22:47.800 --> 22:48.866
Some of them. Get out of there.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.401
Uh, just a few more pages.

22:53.406 --> 22:56.006
Let's go, I can't pay you double
if you don't do the work.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.042
Forget the records.
Just get out.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.710
Okay, I found it.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.680
Grady rented a refrigerated
locker by the airport.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.483
It's 225 Box Car Avenue,
locker 17.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.418
(gun cocks)
MAN: What the hell?!

23:08.554 --> 23:10.821
Patrick, these guys are
going through our papers.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.156
They're LEOs.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.891
Whoa, we're not law
enforcement officers.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.693
Though born in August,
I'm no Leo.

23:17.463 --> 23:19.063
Get in the warehouse now.

23:20.533 --> 23:21.799
All right.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.401
CABE:
<i> You got to go</i>

23:23.403 --> 23:26.003
before things jump off
and someone sees you with me.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.639
(car engine starts)

23:32.945 --> 23:34.545
Hey!

23:34.547 --> 23:36.747
You have been dishonest
since you walked in.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.749
I will not be so rude.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.984
So tell me who
you're with,

23:39.986 --> 23:42.086
or one of you gets shot
in ten seconds.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.087
Simple enough?

23:43.089 --> 23:44.655
We're with Mick.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.556
(groans)

23:45.558 --> 23:47.425
Now you have five.

23:47.427 --> 23:48.692
It's okay, just-just give...

23:48.694 --> 23:50.428
Four, three...
give us some more time...

23:50.430 --> 23:51.495
two...

23:55.501 --> 23:57.067
♪ ♪

23:57.069 --> 23:58.068
Get in!

23:58.070 --> 23:59.136
WALTER:
Get up! Get up! Get up!

24:13.553 --> 24:15.820
Everyone okay?
Yes, we're all right.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.087
I'm not. My heart's racing.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.856
Speaking of racing,
we got to haul ass

24:18.858 --> 24:20.925
over to that refrigerated
storage facility and secure it.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.460
We don't want
to lose that weapon.

24:26.899 --> 24:30.768
SYLVESTER: "Sorry, pal,
I had to take my shot. Mick."

24:30.770 --> 24:33.504
Cabe must have flipped out
when he saw that.

24:33.506 --> 24:34.705
I don't know what
pissed him off more:

24:34.707 --> 24:36.707
no bioweapons
at the storage facility,

24:36.709 --> 24:39.043
or Mick stealing
the weapon for himself.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.911
I guess Grady wasn't
the only one who was thinking

24:40.913 --> 24:42.947
about sandy beaches
and rum drinks.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.215
It's got to suck
to have a friend

24:44.217 --> 24:45.649
stab you in the back
like that.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.685
I just got off with
the Border Patrol.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.176
They're searching 30 cars deep

24:49.177 --> 24:50.666
into the line
to get into Tijuana,

24:50.667 --> 24:52.156
but nothing yet.
Okay, what about Canada?

24:52.158 --> 24:54.158
Eh, Mick and the cold weather,
they don't get along.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.626
It's the whole reason
he moved out here

24:55.628 --> 24:56.894
from New York
in the first place.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.128
He's heading south.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.129
I know this guy.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.598
If you knew him that well,

25:00.599 --> 25:02.066
you would have seen
the double-cross coming.

25:02.067 --> 25:03.534
Your sticking your mouth
in the lion's head, Doc.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.603
SYLVESTER:
It's been a few hours.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.705
You think maybe he's waiting
on something before he leaves?

25:07.707 --> 25:09.240
At a primal level,

25:09.242 --> 25:10.975
only three things will stop
someone on the run.

25:10.977 --> 25:11.976
Family...

25:11.978 --> 25:13.143
Mick's got no family.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.612
...lack of money
or resources...

25:14.614 --> 25:16.614
No, he's got five
million waiting for him

25:16.616 --> 25:18.148
if he can get to Balio
and make that delivery.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.917
...or love. HAPPY: We
listened through the door.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.185
He said he dumped
his girl Lorraine

25:21.187 --> 25:22.920
because she was
gambling too much.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.522
Not an illogical position.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.625
Maybe not a truthful one either.

25:27.627 --> 25:31.161
Doc said maybe I don't know Mick
as well as I think I do,

25:31.163 --> 25:33.597
so maybe I was wrong to believe
that he was leaving Lorraine.

25:33.599 --> 25:36.600
I mean, he was crazy
about that woman.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.002
The sun rose and set on her.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.679
Guy like him, you think he cares

25:39.680 --> 25:41.355
if his girl likes
to throw chips in the middle?

25:41.356 --> 25:43.031
He's probably got a seat
next to her at the table.

25:43.032 --> 25:44.707
WALTER: Okay, so let's assume
that they're still together.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.177
Logical thing to do,
to throw us off the scent.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.312
She's been waiting
all alone for him

25:48.314 --> 25:49.613
to pull off
that big score today.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.282
Anxious.
Nervous.

25:51.284 --> 25:53.284
And what calms the nerves
of an addicted gambler

25:53.286 --> 25:55.085
more than a few hands
of Texas hold 'em.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.088
If we're right and she's holed
up somewhere waiting for him,

25:58.090 --> 25:59.823
she's gonna go
someplace she knows,

25:59.825 --> 26:02.760
someplace calm
and familiar to her.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.028
My guess is either
that roach trap

26:04.030 --> 26:05.296
next to the Diamond Earl Casino

26:05.298 --> 26:07.731
or the one near
the Silver Shoes Card Room.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.702
Not that I know both intimately.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.304
CABE: Paige and Happy can
cover the Diamond Earl.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.639
Walter, Toby and I can
head over to the Card Room.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.308
What's Lorraine's last name?

26:17.310 --> 26:18.776
Winters.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.644
So, Sly, you find
a photo of her online,

26:20.646 --> 26:22.046
get it to all the
border patrol agents.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.781
Also shut down<i> her </i>
credit cards and Mick's.

26:23.783 --> 26:24.982
On it.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.284
Wait, hold on.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.786
Isn't this a shot in the dark?

26:28.788 --> 26:30.921
The chemist that was paid
to make that bioweapon

26:30.923 --> 26:32.289
is in the wind,
and we don't know

26:32.291 --> 26:34.291
who they're shipping
it to in Balio.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.293
All we got is the guy
who stole it,

26:36.295 --> 26:38.862
and if we don't find him,
a million people can die.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.867
So we take that shot.

26:43.869 --> 26:46.103

Man, Mick really pulled the wool
over Cabe's eyes, didn't he?

26:54.680 --> 26:56.680
He did.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.315
Is that what you're
worried about?

Cabe getting tricked?

I just can't believe
Toby used to live like he did.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.990
I mean, I knew he gambled,

but the bookies, broken fingers
and no-tell motels...

27:10.229 --> 27:11.996
I-I don't like thinking
about him like that.

27:11.998 --> 27:15.032
You don't like thinking
about him becoming that again.

27:15.034 --> 27:18.869

of wagon I hitched my star to.

27:18.871 --> 27:21.038
TOBY:
Uh, this is it.

pacing like crazy.

27:28.648 --> 27:29.880
She's waiting for her man.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.118
Yeah, well, she's not the only
one waiting for her man.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.387
Grady's got two guys
in the room right next to her,

27:36.389 --> 27:37.955
and Lorraine has no idea.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.165
Oh yeah.

27:48.167 --> 27:51.902
Yeah, well, they'll be
waiting for a while.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.904
This oil is fresh
and clear; it's new.

27:53.906 --> 27:54.972
It's game-show new.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.340
I knew he stole my oil.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.008
Maybe it's just
another leaky car.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.878
Leaking fresh oil from a spot

28:00.880 --> 28:02.880
with a perfect vantage point

28:02.882 --> 28:04.815
That is a big coincidence.

PAIGE: So let's call the cops
and get her out of there.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.285
Mick'll never cut a deal
with the cops.

28:08.287 --> 28:11.755
But if we can get her out of
there, he'll cut a deal with me.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.457
He knows I'm a man
of my word, unlike him.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.092
Now, how do we get her
out of there

28:15.094 --> 28:17.094
when she's surrounded
by guys with guns?

28:17.096 --> 28:18.712

coming into her room?

28:26.072 --> 28:27.237
Does she have a TV?

28:28.941 --> 28:31.241
Yeah, it's on.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.243
Then we're gonna speak
with her directly.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.446

a television studio.

He's got something that

about heading south.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.644
Chartering a boat to Balio.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.080
We were gonna live

32:30.082 --> 32:31.415

Guests of the government.

32:32.685 --> 32:35.118
PAIGE: Well, he
might get his wish.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.154
"South" is a pretty
general description

where he's going.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.557
WALTER:
Not necessarily.

32:40.559 --> 32:43.226
He said he just
swung by the motel.

32:43.228 --> 32:44.695
So if he is driving
down to his boat,

32:44.697 --> 32:46.596
he doesn't want
to have car troubles

32:46.598 --> 32:48.298
that could slow him down

32:48.300 --> 32:49.733
or draw attention to him.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.602
And since he doesn't have any
more of my oil to steal...

32:52.604 --> 32:55.439
And the rest
was leaking from his car...

32:55.441 --> 32:57.474
That means he has
to hit a gas station

32:57.476 --> 32:58.976
before he goes
on the freeway.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.744
The closest gas station
to the motel

33:00.746 --> 33:02.212
and the freeway entrance

33:02.214 --> 33:03.580
is at the corner
of Stilton and Barrow!

33:03.582 --> 33:05.082
HAPPY:
Okay, that's not far.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.483
By the time he drives there,
buys oil,

33:06.485 --> 33:07.985
pours two liters into his car,
gasses up...

33:07.987 --> 33:08.986
PAIGE:
You can be there!

33:08.988 --> 33:10.087
You can be there already

33:10.089 --> 33:11.321
if you stop talking and go!

33:11.323 --> 33:13.290
Happy, take your truck.
Let's go, come on!

33:16.061 --> 33:17.327
Take Green, it's clear.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.096
It'll get you right onto Barrow.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.064
Guys, if there's a line
for gas or a wait to buy oil,

33:21.066 --> 33:22.332
he could be there.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.433
<i> I'll handle this.</i>

33:23.434 --> 33:24.533
I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.370
Coming up on Stilton.

33:26.372 --> 33:29.106

No one there.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.640
On Barrow. Nothing here either.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.379
There he goes.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.014
He's heading toward that onramp!

33:37.016 --> 33:38.148
If he gets on
that freeway

33:38.150 --> 33:39.483
and he finds out
we're after him,

33:39.485 --> 33:41.051
in the state he's in,
he could kill someone.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.285
I see him!

33:42.287 --> 33:43.720
I'll force him onto
the service road.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.289

33:56.201 --> 33:57.401
CABE:
No, that's Happy.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.736
I'm the headlight
headed right toward you.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.275
Playing chicken.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.344
Like we used to on our bikes.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.146
Oh, yeah, head-on collision
with a bioweapon in his car.

34:09.148 --> 34:10.447
This is ill-advised.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.449
So is letting him get away
with that damn canister.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.334
There's no other choice.

34:14.335 --> 34:16.218
But, Cabe,
I always won at chicken.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.262
Doesn't have to end
this way, buddy.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.330
That's your call! You're
the only vote that counts.

34:27.332 --> 34:29.066
I would like a vote in this.
You're boxed in.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.767
I've always had your back
and you burned me.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.836
This is your last shot
to get it right.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.838
I got nothing in my life

34:34.840 --> 34:37.374
but this $5 million canister
next to me.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.109
That's a shame, 'cause I'm not
letting you cash it in.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.153
HAPPY:
Uh, Cabe,

34:50.155 --> 34:51.688
I'm gonna slow down now.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.690
(horns honking) WALTER:
<i> Yeah, we should, too.</i>

34:53.692 --> 34:54.858
Ten seconds until impact!

34:58.397 --> 34:59.529
I'm not blinking.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.198
Me, either.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.666
(horn blaring)

35:02.668 --> 35:04.835
I'm not blinking!
WALTER: Three, two, one...

35:09.741 --> 35:12.442
(horns blaring)

35:12.444 --> 35:14.144
Cabe!
I'm not blinking!

35:22.621 --> 35:24.621
(engine sputtering)

35:24.623 --> 35:26.623
Out of the car
with your hands up!

35:26.625 --> 35:28.525
Ah! Ah...

35:32.564 --> 35:34.698
(exhales)

35:39.905 --> 35:42.239
Well...

35:42.241 --> 35:44.774
you finally won at chicken.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.376
(grunts)
Mick Doherty,

35:46.378 --> 35:47.511
you're under arrest!

35:47.513 --> 35:49.412
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.747
(grunts)

35:52.818 --> 35:54.417
Want to know
the sad thing?

35:54.419 --> 35:57.888
You're still
the best friend I ever had.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.261
Bingo!
I just got a bid from a guy

36:04.263 --> 36:06.396
willing to buy
all the designer soap

36:06.398 --> 36:07.597
at ten bucks a bottle!

36:07.599 --> 36:09.499
I am cleaning up...

36:09.501 --> 36:12.569
which is ironic, because
I'm giving away all my soap.

36:12.571 --> 36:13.937
Grady and his men
have been apprehended.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.439
The CDC is destroying
the bioweapon.

36:16.441 --> 36:18.408
Lorraine's not gonna
face charges.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.277
Mick won't testify against her,
if you can believe that.

36:20.279 --> 36:21.611
The State Department's

36:21.613 --> 36:22.946
looking into Balio's activities.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.215
All in all, it worked.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.252
Thank you.
Sure.

36:30.889 --> 36:34.958
Listen, I, uh, owe
you all an apology.

36:36.695 --> 36:37.961
I should've listened to you

36:37.963 --> 36:39.529
when you warned me
about trusting Mick,

36:39.531 --> 36:41.531
but I wanted to believe
that he could change.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.333
Because of that,

36:43.335 --> 36:45.502
I put you all at risk,
and that's unforgiveable.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.240
Truth is, no one changes.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.975
And I should've known that.

36:54.513 --> 36:57.347
I'm sorry. Truly.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.250
PAIGE:
Well, Cabe,

37:00.252 --> 37:02.252
you were only trying
to see the best in Mick

37:02.254 --> 37:04.654
when everyone else
just saw a criminal.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.389
Just like you saw
the best with this team,

37:06.391 --> 37:08.525
when everyone just saw misfits.

37:08.527 --> 37:10.460
That's a really

37:10.462 --> 37:13.563
wonderful trait and you don't
have to apologize for it.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.832
Thank you, kiddo.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.634
You're welcome.

37:18.837 --> 37:19.936
You know, I guess,

37:19.938 --> 37:21.771
while we're in
the apologizing spirit,

37:21.773 --> 37:24.441
I suppose
I owe you all one, too.

37:25.711 --> 37:29.512
My ego and my pride have
always been my Achilles heel

37:29.514 --> 37:31.448
and today I-I let a buffoon

37:31.450 --> 37:33.850
egg me into
a contest

37:33.852 --> 37:36.419
instead of buying more time,
which is what we needed.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.954
He literally egged you on
by claiming you laid eggs.

37:38.890 --> 37:39.956
That's funny.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.625
I take back my apology

37:41.627 --> 37:42.759
as it pertains to you.

37:42.761 --> 37:43.893
TOBY:
I'm the only one

37:43.895 --> 37:45.295
whose vice helped this team.

37:45.297 --> 37:46.696
If it weren't
for my gambling,

37:46.698 --> 37:47.998
we wouldn't have found Lorraine,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.300
which led to Mick,
which led to us saving

37:50.302 --> 37:51.735
the fine Aztec
people of Balio.

37:51.737 --> 37:52.802
My vice is a virtue.

37:52.804 --> 37:53.837
I never need to change,

37:53.839 --> 37:55.505
and I owe an apology to no one.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.973
Hey.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.008
You. Me.

37:58.010 --> 37:59.476
Talk now.

38:01.013 --> 38:03.480
Ah, the missus...

38:09.488 --> 38:11.788
Yes, my turtledove?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.623
Aah! My nurple!

38:13.625 --> 38:15.058
You're an idiot.
What for?

38:15.060 --> 38:17.661
I just saved the Aztecs.

38:17.663 --> 38:18.995
You really think that
the gambling is a positive?

38:18.997 --> 38:20.897
You think you don't
need to change?

38:20.899 --> 38:21.898
That this is good for you?

38:21.900 --> 38:23.366
Well, if I answer honestly,

38:23.368 --> 38:24.601
are you gonna be mad at me?

38:24.603 --> 38:26.336
Listen, stupid...

38:26.338 --> 38:27.871
I grew up bouncing

38:27.873 --> 38:31.308
from foster family
to group home and back again.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.476
One thing they all
had in common...

38:33.478 --> 38:35.445
they all promised
they'd be the last one.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.047
They all promised
stability,

38:37.049 --> 38:39.316
security and happiness.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.085
And today, I see someone

38:42.087 --> 38:43.953
who has the potential
to be unreliable.

38:43.955 --> 38:47.624
Of disappearing back
into marathon poker games

38:47.626 --> 38:49.859
and betting sessions in
a bookmobile with The Hustle.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.630
I cannot have the rug

38:53.632 --> 38:54.931
pulled out from under me again.

38:54.933 --> 38:57.600
I won't.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.737
I love you.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.807
My gambling...

39:03.809 --> 39:05.375
it's a shadow of what it was.

39:05.377 --> 39:06.509
Are you kidding?

39:06.511 --> 39:07.777
You've been betting like crazy.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.079
I told you:

39:09.081 --> 39:11.681
that's 'cause
I'm manically thrilled about us

39:11.683 --> 39:13.516
and that is how
my pathology plays out.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.024
All right.

39:22.728 --> 39:23.927
Listen, this is easy to fix.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.563
Got a, um...

39:26.565 --> 39:28.631
$75 scratch off,

39:28.633 --> 39:31.034
$12 exacta box
for 180 bucks,

39:31.036 --> 39:33.837
and... and my picks
for the weekend games.

39:46.651 --> 39:50.520
I swear
I'm never gonna gamble again.

39:50.522 --> 39:51.988
Ever.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.026
You heard Cabe.
People don't change.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.129
I'm not changing.

39:59.131 --> 40:01.064
I made one last monster bet.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.633
I'm gambling

40:03.635 --> 40:05.502
that a skinny,
moderately good-looking

40:05.504 --> 40:07.470
pain-in-the-neck like me
can land someone like you.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.941
It's the biggest
gamble of my life.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.079
Okay?

40:18.917 --> 40:19.983
Okay.

40:26.992 --> 40:30.026
WALTER: <i> Do you really believe</i>
<i> that people can't change?</i>

40:30.028 --> 40:31.761
Unfortunately,
I do, son.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.096
Good.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.899
Because Toby is
pretty astute,

40:35.901 --> 40:39.602
and he saw a connection with art
imbedded in your psyche,

40:39.604 --> 40:42.705
so I hacked
some of your private records.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.774
I'm not sure I appreciate that.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.509
With pure intentions.

40:46.511 --> 40:49.512
Anyway, I found that
you took some classes

40:49.514 --> 40:51.514
at a high school
for the arts in Brooklyn.

40:51.516 --> 40:53.049
I took a lot of heat for that.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.652
Boys in my neighborhood
didn't paint.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.787
Mick always had my back.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.457
He thought it was cool
I was artistic.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.460
Well, it obviously still means
something to you, so...

41:03.462 --> 41:07.664
I signed you up for a class
at the community college.

41:07.666 --> 41:10.733
The session starts
at 9:00 tonight.

41:10.735 --> 41:12.802
Oh, I don't know, kid.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.705
Well, it's already paid for,

41:15.707 --> 41:17.874
so... consider it.

41:23.548 --> 41:25.949
♪ ♪

41:25.951 --> 41:27.617
So tonight,
we're going to be working with

41:27.619 --> 41:30.687
Light Portrait Pink
and Titanium White.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.694
Is something wrong?

41:37.696 --> 41:39.996
No, it's just...
(sighs)

41:39.998 --> 41:42.932
I'm not sure if
I'm still a guy who paints.

41:47.906 --> 41:49.239
Did you paint once?

41:49.241 --> 41:51.708
Yes.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.110
Why?

41:54.112 --> 41:55.845
'Cause I liked it.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.847
My friend encouraged me.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.884
Sounds like
a good friend.

42:03.255 --> 42:05.054
He was.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.058
He was.
