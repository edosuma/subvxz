with Darijo taking his 20%.

00:07.800 --> 00:08.600
No good.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.080
It has to be 50.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.120
20% may be too much.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.000
How much too much?

00:13.120 --> 00:14.120
About 20%.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.040
To the job.

It's my money.

So maybe something's up.

You have no idea
where the van is.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.160
Behind a bloody dairy.

You tossed these.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.880
They got Wolf.

Man.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.880
I had no idea you take
under-age drinking

We don't know that
he's been arrested.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.400
He got taken away
by the fucking cops.

That doesn't
always mean arrested.

I don't know, do I,
because I wasn't there.

01:14.880 --> 01:15.760
Well, were they in that pub?

Was that part of the plan?

01:46.560 --> 01:48.080

01:48.200 --> 01:49.400
Bullshit.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.920
You let him go.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.200

He had the keys.

trying to toss them.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.400
Yeah, but we're a
ways off an arrest yet.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.280
Because he's a West.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.600
Do we mean to treat
them differently

10:32.240 --> 10:33.040
So fuck off.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.720
Just for a while.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.640
Please?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.400
Well, if Mike comes lookingfor you, I'm telling him

10:43.520 --> 10:44.920
you forced me.

10:45.040 --> 10:45.880
As long as you don't pickup the phone and call him,

10:46.000 --> 10:46.760
I don't give a shit.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.240
I suppose you want
a cup of tea, then?

10:59.680 --> 11:02.400
Hey, Rita.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.520
This is all gone to hell, eh?

11:05.640 --> 11:07.280
That about covers it.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.560
Yeah, well the Doslics werehere when the cops showed up.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.760
Took off when they saw the pigs.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.800
Is Ted inside?

11:16.920 --> 11:17.680
Cop shop.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.920
They arrested him?

[music playing]

11:23.320 --> 11:24.920

11:25.040 --> 11:26.840
It was a bloody good job.

Real class.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.200
The bloody abseilingdown into the court yard.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.800
That is a true professional
at the top of his game.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.920
Are you trying toflatter me into confessing?

11:37.040 --> 11:39.000
Is that you admitting
it was all your idea?

11:39.120 --> 11:40.200
Oh, look.
I wish it was.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.800
Sounds like a sweet nut.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.880
Except for the
abseiling nonsense.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.400
I have a fear of heights.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.040
God's honest truth.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.560
You've never told the God'shonest truth in your life, Ted.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.480
I'm sorry you havesuch a low opinion of me.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.000
My opinion of
you went down when

11:55.120 --> 11:56.520
you started using firearms.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.000
Well, that had nothing
to do with me and--

11:58.120 --> 11:59.800
And again.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.960
There was a gun involved.

12:03.080 --> 12:06.360
That's not like you, Ted.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.680
No.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.600
It isn't.

12:11.640 --> 12:17.960
So charge me, my son, my
friends, or let us go.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.000
If I could help you,
I would, Mr. McArthy.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.320
But I saw the error of
my ways many years ago,

12:23.440 --> 12:28.160
and now I'm just a
humble shop assistant.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.160
Uh-huh.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.920
Tough game, that fashion
retailing, is it?

12:34.040 --> 12:37.040
Those nice young men youput me in a cell with--

12:37.160 --> 12:39.680
I guess you could say wehad political differences.

Sit back down, pretty boy.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.280

Let's get O'Driscoll, the brainsof the operation, in here.

Yeah.

going to be very useful.

I'm not a useless cock.

No.

I said your cock is useless.

I'm more than
man enough for her.

It doesn't matter
how big it is, Phineas.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.800
Sooner or later, Carol's goingto start looking elsewhere.

No, no.

13:23.840 --> 13:24.640
No, she wouldn't.

Liar!

Liar!

13:26.920 --> 13:28.120
You still want
me to question him?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.040
That's not true!

13:31.400 --> 13:32.160
OK.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.080

It's got to be better than theriver of shit I'm swimming in.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.080
You should probably know.

I've had to bring in Ted,along with little Ted.

Well, that's not
going to go down well.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.480
I've already had her onthe phone, making threats,

14:02.600 --> 14:03.880
if you get my drift.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.240
Oh, yes.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.560
Let me know if
she talks to you.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.000
Will do.

not going to make lunch.

- Obviously.- Then we'll talk at home.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.440
Yep.
I'll see you there.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.280
You mean when is shegonna find the stolen van?

14:33.400 --> 14:35.480
Just answer the question.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.480
First thing tomorrow.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.760
Right.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.640
When it gets dark,
you're moving that van.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.240
The plan was to take
it back to my place.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.200
I think we can assume
that plan is fucked.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.440
We'll need to findsomewhere else to stash it.

My good manners must havebeen left when your husband

14:53.840 --> 14:54.880
fucking betrayed me.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.400
Funny, because
the way I heard it,

14:56.520 --> 14:58.120
you were the one who
started that game.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.200
We felt the terms of thedeal needed renegotiating.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.080
Right.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.400
So now what?

15:03.520 --> 15:05.760
You've decided to come
after the womenfolk?

15:05.880 --> 15:07.080
It's OK, Rita.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.200

I am here to help.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.200
Really?

15:13.320 --> 15:16.400
Obviously, the van
is hidden somewhere.

15:16.520 --> 15:18.040
So we will take care of the van.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.480
Make it disappear.

deal Ted throw away.

15:26.360 --> 15:29.400
See, the thing is, Darijo--

15:29.520 --> 15:33.040
you tried to blackmail Tedinto getting a larger cut.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.160
Not blackmail.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.400
Then he did what
he needed to do.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.880
And the second thing--

15:39.000 --> 15:42.480
even if we did fall for
your smarmy bullshit,

15:42.600 --> 15:46.400
no one here has any
idea where the van is.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.640
This is bullshit.

15:47.760 --> 15:51.480
Someone here knows
where the van is.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.440
You.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.520
You're Wolf's woman, right?

15:54.640 --> 15:55.960
He was driving the van.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.440
And now he's at the
cop shop, you fuckwit.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.640
When the hell could
he have told me?

15:58.760 --> 16:00.080
And I'm no one's
woman, all right?

16:00.200 --> 16:01.160
Stop lying to me.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.040
Where is the fucking van?

16:02.160 --> 16:03.760

That's no way to speak to women.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.080
Nobody here knows
where the van is.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.000
So go.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.000
Before this gets stupid.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.800
It would be a shame
if new evidence came

16:20.920 --> 16:22.000

16:22.120 --> 16:23.400

16:23.520 --> 16:25.440
Don't be an idiot.

16:25.560 --> 16:29.000
If you do that, we all go down.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.360
We'll be watching.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.880
So two uniformed
guards get out.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.160
They start to unload.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.480
The guards go in.

16:48.800 --> 16:53.040
And Wolfgang West and LeftyMunroe exit and drive off.

Maybe I am.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.640
Maybe I'm not.

17:14.760 --> 17:19.080

we all walk out of here.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.840
You might do that, Ted.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.520
You're a slippery bastard.

17:45.640 --> 17:49.880
But your son, he will not.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.080
Because your criminal geniusson had the van keys on him.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.600
You know which keys I'm
talking about, right?

17:58.640 --> 18:00.440

18:02.840 --> 18:06.560
The fucking van keys, Ted.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.280
He can argue all he wants.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.160
But him plus keys equals
serious probable cause.

18:12.280 --> 18:13.440
I'm sure even you can see that.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.680
Well, maybe we shouldleave that to the lawyers.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.520
Do we really need to?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.960
There were two people
who drove that van away.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.280
One's a kid.

18:33.400 --> 18:38.920
Maybe he'll do two years
soft time, out in one.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.080
If he helps us put
away the other bastard.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.440
The investigation
can end right there.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.800
No one else need know.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.480
If you're open to this, Ican arrange for you and Wolf

18:53.600 --> 18:55.840
to have some quiet time todiscuss how it might work.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.520
I wouldn't mind, actually--

19:02.640 --> 19:05.160
having a private
word with my son.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.640
Good man.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.320
So I can give
him some pointers

19:09.440 --> 19:14.280
on how to tell a pig to go fuckhimself with a rusty crowbar.

19:14.400 --> 19:18.000
You'd rather let your son goto prison than give up Lefty?

19:18.120 --> 19:20.120
Wests don't dob.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.400
You might wish Lefty
had your principles.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.120
Because when I had
him in here, he

19:24.240 --> 19:27.000
gave you up at the very
thought of doing time.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.960
And you choose thatmaggot over your own son.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.480

19:49.360 --> 19:51.760
Ugh.

19:53.640 --> 19:57.520
It tastes like petrol
mixed with vinegar.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.760
Ugh.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.360
You know, you can
go home if you want.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.440
But then I'd miss
enjoying you in pain.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.600
That's harsh.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.320
Not when it comes to you.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.520
I wasn't that bad, was I?

20:10.640 --> 20:12.520
Keep drinking
the sherry, Lefty.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.800
You know, I've been
thinking about where

20:15.920 --> 20:17.400
you and I went wrong.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.920
Well, for me, it was somewherebetween the I and the do.

Nah.

We were great when
we first got married.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.040
We loved each other back then.

I get what game you're
talking about, Lefty.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.120
And not for the
better, I reckon.

thinking, anyway.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.880
[phone ringing]

20:46.000 --> 20:47.160
McArthy.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.280
Time to end this.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.880
MIKE: Hello, Rita.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.920
I want my boy and
my husband back.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.240
In that order?

20:53.360 --> 20:56.840
Don't be a smartass.
What do you want?

20:56.960 --> 20:58.560
I don't need anything, Rita.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.800
Thanks to Wolf having
the van keys on him.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.800
You know which van I'm
talking about, right?

21:04.920 --> 21:07.080
As in, not Ted's van.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.240
OK.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.760
Let me put this another way.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.920
You know me, right?

21:22.040 --> 21:23.240
For my sins.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.760
So you know that when
it comes to my boy,

21:25.880 --> 21:28.360
I will go to any lengths
to keep him out of jail.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.800
You know this from
history, right?

21:30.920 --> 21:32.040
I do.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.680
So what you need
to know, this time,

21:34.800 --> 21:39.320
is if he goes away, whenit could have been avoided,

21:39.440 --> 21:42.160
I will tear it all fucking down.

21:42.280 --> 21:45.200
And I will take people with me.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.640
That would be kind
of self-defeating,

21:46.760 --> 21:48.000
don't you think?

21:48.120 --> 21:50.960
Call it the price you
pay for a mother's love.

21:51.080 --> 21:54.160
So, Mike.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.800
How can it be avoided?

21:57.920 --> 22:02.920
What would it take, were itin my grasp to end this thing?

22:03.040 --> 22:05.720
The missing van and
its contents, to start.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.160
I suppose I could ask around.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.160
I'd still need someone
to put in the frame.

22:11.280 --> 22:12.680
Not my family.
MIKE: Obviously.

22:12.800 --> 22:13.760
And not Lefty.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.200
Hah.

22:15.320 --> 22:17.480
What is it with
you guys and him?

22:17.600 --> 22:19.880
Does that mean you'vetalked to Ted about this?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.840
Apparently, Wests don't dob.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.840
I just know that Lefty's weak.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.320
He'd give up anyone
you asked him to.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.600
Guilty or not.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.040
Well, yeah, there is that.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.400
But I'm still going to
need someone to charge.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.800
I can get you that.

22:36.680 --> 22:37.680
OK.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.400
Here's what we're going to do.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.320
Go to the dairy.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.560
Get the van.

22:41.680 --> 22:42.680
Drive it up into the
white X. You know

22:42.800 --> 22:43.680
the reserve near [inaudible]?

22:43.800 --> 22:45.200
Sure.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.280
RITA: Leave it there.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.200
What about the money?

22:47.320 --> 22:48.600
RITA: Money and all.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.920
Why?

22:50.040 --> 22:52.080
Doesn't matter.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.200
It does to me.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.200
This is what Ted
wants us to do.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.160
So do your fucking job.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.840
You, you go with
him, to the dairy.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.880
You make sure that your sisterkeeps her mouth shut if anyone

23:01.000 --> 23:02.360
starts asking questions.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.240
And how do we actuallyknow this is what Ted wants?

23:04.360 --> 23:06.960
Because when Ted's
not here, I'm it.

23:07.080 --> 23:07.960
You got any more problems?

23:08.080 --> 23:09.120
Yeah.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.080
If I'm going to
dump the van there,

23:10.200 --> 23:11.280
how am I meant to get home?

23:11.400 --> 23:12.400
It's in the middle
of bloody nowhere.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.120
You need to
follow him up there.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.200
- Me?
- Yes.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.520
You've got your car here, right?

23:19.640 --> 23:20.840
What if the Doslics
are watching the house

23:20.960 --> 23:21.760
and they follow us?

23:24.880 --> 23:26.920
Where's the car that
you stole for the job?

23:27.040 --> 23:27.840
Couple of blocks away.

23:27.960 --> 23:28.720
OK.

23:28.840 --> 23:29.720
Go out the back, use that.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.160
A stolen car?

23:31.280 --> 23:33.080
I've never driven a
stolen car before.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.160
I've always left that stuff--

23:34.280 --> 23:35.520
Carol, I'm sure
you'll be fine.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.400
And while we're doing
this, what about Wolf?

23:36.520 --> 23:37.520
Yeah, and Ted?

23:37.640 --> 23:38.720
And Phineas.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.560
He must be going
through hell in there.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.680
What we're doing now
will solve all of that.

23:43.800 --> 23:44.600
How?

23:47.600 --> 23:48.400
It just will.

23:51.800 --> 23:55.240
We're leaving the van therefor the cops, aren't we?

23:55.360 --> 23:56.120
Yeah.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.960
And the money?

23:58.080 --> 23:59.440
There'll be other jobs.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.440
We've walked away from moneybefore for our own good.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.040
We can walk away this time.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.680
Fuck.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.640
It's what needs to happen,Bert, if we want our men out.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.240
You've been talking to
the cops, haven't you?

24:08.360 --> 24:09.680
Yes.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.200
Of course I've been talkingto the fucking cops.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.200
Heads up, girlie.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.280
That's the way the world works.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.440
Isn't that so, Bert?

24:14.560 --> 24:15.400
They've got nothing on us.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.520
We can staunch it out.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.880
We've done that
in the past, too.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.680
Wolf had the van keys on him.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.880
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.

24:24.000 --> 24:24.800
Fuck!

24:24.920 --> 24:25.920
Yes.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.080
So this is the deal.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.440
This is how it has to play out.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.960
Any further fucking questions?

24:32.080 --> 24:34.400
[music playing]

24:43.120 --> 24:44.920
There's a [inaudible]parked just down the road.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.800
It doesn't matter.
Let them follow me.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.760
We should come with
you, for protection.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.400
Bless you, Falani, but
I don't need protection.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.600
It might help if weknew where you were going.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.880
No, it wouldn't.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.160
Guard the house and
stay off the drugs.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.480
You off?

25:01.600 --> 25:03.000
Yes, constable.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.840
I'm going home to havedinner, because I'm starving.

25:04.960 --> 25:05.840
What about the West mob?

25:05.960 --> 25:07.160
What about them?

25:07.280 --> 25:08.200
You're the one with
the hard on for them.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.320
Do I let them go?

25:09.440 --> 25:10.240
Let them go.

25:10.360 --> 25:11.240
Torture them.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.120
I really don't care.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.040
I've had a gut's full.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.520
So you're walking away.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.720
That's central's problem, now.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.720
The robbery happened
on their patch.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.040
They'll question them or not.

25:20.160 --> 25:20.960
I don't give a shit.

25:21.080 --> 25:21.840
Of course you don't.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.320
You make one
more fucking snide

25:26.440 --> 25:28.520
comment about me, constable--

25:28.640 --> 25:31.120
there's a lot more
where that came from.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.600
You can stay here all
night if you want to,

25:33.720 --> 25:35.880
but I have to go home now.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.200
To your boyfriend?

25:37.320 --> 25:38.520
You were doing well
when you were keeping

25:38.640 --> 25:39.640
your thoughts to yourself.

25:39.760 --> 25:40.560
Don't mess it up now.

25:40.680 --> 25:41.880
Seriously.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.240
What's the deal
with you and him?

25:45.360 --> 25:46.600
I love him.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.680
And he loves me.
- Yeah.

25:47.800 --> 25:48.680
I buy the second half of that.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.320
I need him.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.520
To get over it.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.680
Get over what?

25:56.800 --> 25:58.600
My addiction to
pricks like you.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.440
We had some fun,
though, didn't we?

26:05.560 --> 26:08.600
Even through all the fights.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.040
Are you staying or going?

26:11.160 --> 26:12.000
Going.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.400
[music playing]

26:23.240 --> 26:24.760
Oh, for fuck's sake.

26:24.880 --> 26:25.920
I'll give you a lift.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.840
So what I do if
we get separated?

26:32.960 --> 26:35.000
Because, you know, boys
drive faster than girls.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.520
Do know where thereserve we're going to is?

26:36.640 --> 26:37.640
Yes.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.320
Phineas and I used
to go there when

26:39.440 --> 26:40.720
we first got together and weretrying to get away from Mimi.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.760
Well, then, drive there,and I'll be waiting.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.520
Roger that.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.880
What if we get
chased by the cops?

26:47.000 --> 26:47.960
Oh, that won't happen.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.320
Let's pretend that it does.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.480
Well, then they'll be
chasing me, and not you.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.160
So, if you see flashing lights,pull over like a good citizen

26:54.280 --> 26:57.200
and let them drive past.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.120
That makes sense.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.040
Yes, it does.

27:03.480 --> 27:04.800
I'm a bit nervous.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.760
I can tell.

27:06.880 --> 27:08.440
Do you want to maybe goand get in the car, Carol?

27:08.560 --> 27:10.480
We'll be, uh-- we'll
be rolling in a minute.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.400
OK.

27:11.520 --> 27:12.680
Good plan.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.560
Yeah.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.160
About the only good bit.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.400
No.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.440
I'm not giving you money.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.360
You have to pay me.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.600
I covered for you.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.160
I'm not giving
you money, Mandy.

27:24.280 --> 27:25.960
But there's money in the van.I know there is.

27:26.080 --> 27:27.240
OK.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.680
That has nothing to
do with you, Mandy.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.880
It does now, since yourboyfriend brought it here.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.400
You know he pashed me, right?

27:33.520 --> 27:34.520
Just grow the
fuck up, will you?

27:34.640 --> 27:36.360
He did.
It's true.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.280
OK.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.760
Let me put it another way.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.160
This is serious, all right?

27:40.280 --> 27:41.680
And if you breathe a
word of this to mum,

27:41.800 --> 27:43.440
you will not reach
your next birthday.

27:43.560 --> 27:44.440
Wow.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.920
Look who's suddenly the sca--

27:46.040 --> 27:46.800
Got it?

27:52.400 --> 27:54.760
[music playing]

28:08.280 --> 28:11.200
I need to speak to Darijo.

28:11.320 --> 28:14.880
DARIJO: And that's why wehave a deal with the Chinese.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.920
Ah, Mrs. Ted West.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.280
I'm glad to see you.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.760
I feel terrible about
our last meeting.

28:21.880 --> 28:22.880
I'm sure you do, Darijo.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.120
No, no.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.320
Without the word of
a liar, what must

28:26.440 --> 28:28.520
have seemed to you
and lovely Ms. Carol

28:28.640 --> 28:32.000
and the young woman
with the mouth on her.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.080
I blame these men.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.320
They must come across
dull and brutish.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.160
So is there any chance
we can lose the guys,

28:39.280 --> 28:41.800
so you and I can talk?

28:41.920 --> 28:42.680
Drink?

28:42.800 --> 28:44.760
No.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.480
I'm here about business.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.640
Ah, yes.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.200
It's a pity about ourcurrent business, is it not?

28:51.320 --> 28:52.240
It is.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.640
But I've spoken to Ted.
- Ah.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.080
They've released him.
Good.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.080
No.
They haven't.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.800
It was through an intermediary.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.360
He's asked me to
bring you a deal.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.080
I am all about the deal.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.800
50-50.

29:06.920 --> 29:07.800
So.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.440
The new deal is the old deal.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.000
The one you forced upon him.Yeah.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.200
The one Ted spat
back in my face.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.800
Well, he's had a
chance to reconsider

29:16.920 --> 29:18.680
and now he feels
that this is the best

29:18.800 --> 29:22.120
way forward for our twofamilies, in the long run.

29:22.240 --> 29:27.480
Also, if police find thevan, then Ted West is fucked.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.040
I just do what
I'm told, Darijo.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.440
So do we have a deal?

29:36.400 --> 29:37.640
Sure.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.000
Bring us the van.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.440
I can't do that.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.840
The boys dumped it afteryou started chasing them.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.160
So it's currently
being moved from there

29:45.280 --> 29:47.000
to where you can pick it up.[music playing]

29:47.120 --> 29:48.240
Why not bring it here?

29:48.360 --> 29:50.720
Do you really
want that, Darijo?

29:50.840 --> 29:51.600
No.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.520
Good thought.

29:57.680 --> 29:58.680
OK.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.200
We're good.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.160
We're good.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.640
Well, isn't this
just like old times?

30:11.760 --> 30:13.080
Didn't you love it?

30:13.200 --> 30:13.960
Get out.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.120
You miss it.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.560
The thrill of it.

30:26.680 --> 30:27.840
I'm getting over it, Lefty.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.320
[music playing]

31:08.440 --> 31:10.800
That was the scariest
thing I've ever done.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.320
My heart is pounding.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.880
When you went through
that intersection

31:14.000 --> 31:16.520
and the lights changed andI had to stop, it was like,

31:16.640 --> 31:18.120
it took forever for
them to change back.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.840
It was like time stopped.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.200
I thought I was
going to lose you.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.840
Well, you did good, Carol.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.360
You know, we-- we got here.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.600
It's all so
really exciting, eh?

31:27.720 --> 31:29.360
Buts of me are tingling.

31:29.480 --> 31:30.240
Oh.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.840
That's good to know, but--

31:32.960 --> 31:33.920
maybe we should take off now.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.880
Carol?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.200
I can drive if you want.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.920
It just seems weird.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.720
The tingly bits?

31:46.840 --> 31:48.640
Leaving all that money
just sitting there.

31:48.760 --> 31:49.560
Oh.

31:49.680 --> 31:50.480
Yeah.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.280
Yeah, tell me about it.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.000
Did you have a plan?

31:56.120 --> 31:58.480
Well, it doesn't
matter now, does it?

31:58.600 --> 31:59.400
CAROL: Tell me.

32:05.080 --> 32:08.400
Well, back when
I was with Riana,

32:08.520 --> 32:11.480
I was looking into
my family history.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.240
[inaudible] is what
we call in Maori.

32:15.360 --> 32:19.560
We found that I had this unclewho was in the Maori Battalion.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.240
He was a real hero.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.400
Yeah.
[music playing]

32:22.520 --> 32:23.840
He died at Monte Cassino.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.640
But me and her, we--

32:30.160 --> 32:32.640
we were going to go and
visit the place he died.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.440
What were you and Phineasgoing to do with your share?

32:38.160 --> 32:40.880
We were going to buy a baby.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.200
Oh.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.320
You can do that?

32:45.440 --> 32:47.280
Overseas.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.280
If you know where to look.

32:51.720 --> 32:56.800
SINGING: Downstairs in thecellar drums are beating.

32:56.920 --> 32:57.760
Where have you been?

32:57.880 --> 32:59.400
Nowhere that concerns you.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.160
Got back in and there wereonly these three idiots here.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.880
SINGING: Wounded, nodiscomfort, emotions bleeding.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.080
That was a bit harsh.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.560
There were things
that needed doing.

33:06.680 --> 33:07.680
All good?

33:07.800 --> 33:08.560
All good.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.840
And now they're done.

33:10.960 --> 33:15.760
SINGING: In the river alone,always alone, out of my depth.

33:19.840 --> 33:23.160
Headlong to the ocean.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.640
Will I sink or swim?

33:40.040 --> 33:42.800
If we need to talk to youagain, we'll come looking.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.800
Don't you worry about that.

33:45.920 --> 33:46.760
Now piss off.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.520
Where's my son?

34:07.880 --> 34:09.520
Where is he?

34:09.640 --> 34:11.680
Why isn't Wolf with you?

34:11.800 --> 34:17.960
I have no idea aboutanything you're talking about.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.040
So why didn't they let him gowhen they let all you guys go,

34:20.160 --> 34:21.320
eh?

34:21.440 --> 34:24.000
The keys.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.520
I don't know why he
didn't toss them.

34:25.640 --> 34:28.280
It wasn't like we
needed them anymore.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.600
He must have forgotten.

34:29.720 --> 34:31.200
So he's going to end
up taking the blame.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.840
I know about this.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.240
It's always the youngestwho ends up getting nicked,

34:38.360 --> 34:39.960
while the old guys walk away.

34:40.080 --> 34:43.200
Just without the
money this time.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.520
She said that's what you wanted.

34:44.640 --> 34:47.000
I did a deal with
McArthy to get Wolf out,

34:47.120 --> 34:48.280
to get you all out.

34:48.400 --> 34:49.480
Well, that didn't
happen, did it?

34:49.600 --> 34:50.720
So there's no money?

34:50.840 --> 34:51.720
No, honey.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.880
So we can't buy a baby.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.920
It was the only way Icould think to get you out.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.360
No.
It's OK.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.400
It's OK.
You did the right thing.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.000
For you, yeah.
What about Wolf?

35:00.120 --> 35:01.960
Just shut the
fuck up about Wolf.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.800
You don't even care
about him, do you?

35:03.920 --> 35:05.080
As long as Ted here's out.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.400
Yeah, he'll do a
couple of years inside.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.840
But it'll be good for him.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.680
Teach him how to be bettercrim-- you give a shit.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.600
That is my son that
you are talking about.

35:11.720 --> 35:12.840
And the father of my child.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.640
I found out yesterday.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.200
It was-- going to tell
him when he got home.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.000

35:33.120 --> 35:34.680
RITA: It doesn't make any sense.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.680
I gave them the van, the money,the Doslics all at the scene.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.320
Case closed and
you're off the hook.

35:39.440 --> 35:40.920
McArthy lied.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.560
If he did, he can fuckingkiss goodbye to his true love.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.960
[phone ringing]

35:48.520 --> 35:49.600
Yes.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.320
Where's Detective McArthy?

35:51.440 --> 35:54.480
Hello, Mrs. West.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.720
Put McArthy on.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.080
Sorry, Mrs. West.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.800
He won't be doing anyfavors for you from now on.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.160
Anything I can help with?

36:04.280 --> 36:05.520
Maybe you want to
know about your son.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.080
I want to talk to my son.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.520
Sure.

36:08.640 --> 36:09.960
Maybe you could come downhere and get him to tell

36:10.080 --> 36:10.840
us where he hid the money.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.520
You can go fuck yourself.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.360
Someone's got the money.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.680
What are you
looking at me for?

36:29.800 --> 36:31.200
Well, you were the
last one who saw it.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.360
I didn't take it, though.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.520
Ask her.

36:33.640 --> 36:34.600
We didn't actually
see the money.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.640
That's right.

36:35.760 --> 36:36.680
We didn't even look in the back.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.160
And you didn't think to check?

36:38.280 --> 36:39.080
Why?

36:39.200 --> 36:40.160
The back was locked.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.120
I think.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.720
We didn't check that either.

36:42.840 --> 36:43.720
What about your sister?

36:43.840 --> 36:46.200
She was there the whole time.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.560
She's just a kid.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.520
She wouldn't have the
nerve, or the brains.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.400
Can I ask a question?

36:53.520 --> 36:54.760
Yes, Phineas.

when we were together,

37:20.040 --> 37:20.600

What's wrong?

37:22.440 --> 37:23.200
Nothing.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.960
Fine.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.760
- Old age?
- Something like that.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.280
It's OK.

I can cure you.

summer treating you?

37:45.480 --> 37:46.840

I love you.

37:49.040 --> 37:49.800
I love you too.

37:56.880 --> 37:58.760
I thought you'd be in bed.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.800
Not sleepy.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.360
Been a bit of a day.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.000
Tell me about it.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.760
So I gather.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.320
You want to talk about it?

38:08.440 --> 38:09.200
Not really.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.120
But it did help me
sort a few things out.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.240
Oh yes?

38:16.360 --> 38:18.160
You're quitting that job.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.160
You're not going back there.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.320
Mike, we've talked about this.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.200
You hate it there.

38:21.320 --> 38:24.600
You know you do.

38:24.720 --> 38:28.240
So instead, we're
going on a holiday.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.120
You, me, and the girls.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.680
We just take off.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.800
Go to see Desiree in London.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.320
Start there and see
where we end up.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.040
We can afford this, can we?

38:39.160 --> 38:39.960
Yeah.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.600
We can.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.360
I perfed today.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.480
Well.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.760
It was suggested
that I perf after I

38:48.880 --> 38:50.280
whacked a fellow officer.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.040
Twice, it turns out.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.400
But the point is, with
that and my super,

38:56.520 --> 38:58.440
we have enough money to
last us for a long time.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.520
It's that much, is it?

39:00.640 --> 39:03.000
I've been a pig for
a long time, Ngaire.

39:03.120 --> 39:03.920
It adds up.

39:06.680 --> 39:12.920
And today I felt like a pig,having to deal with the Wests,

39:13.040 --> 39:15.320
knowing that we're
both in their pockets.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.800
And I thought, fuck this.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.440
I don't want to live
like this anymore.

39:19.560 --> 39:20.680
[music playing]

39:20.800 --> 39:23.440
So I took the money and ran.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.840
So you don't have to
be Mrs. Piggy anymore.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.720
Or listen to Ted's
shit bacon jokes.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.200
I want us to start
a life of our own.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.920
As far away from
them as possible.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.360
You know I have
expensive tastes, right?

39:39.480 --> 39:41.040
I factored that
into the equation.

39:47.280 --> 39:50.560
Come to bed.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.040

So, Mike.

40:06.920 --> 40:11.480
How can it be avoided?

40:11.600 --> 40:16.720
What would it take, were itin my grasp to end this thing?

40:20.600 --> 40:22.320

headed for Melbourne tomorrow.

let that slip, well.

41:45.800 --> 41:54.080
And I must have you
for the life of me.

41:58.640 --> 42:02.400
I know that sunshine
follows rain.

42:05.680 --> 42:09.800
I know that pleasure
follows pain.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.160
Call the lawyer.

42:11.280 --> 42:18.200
SINGING: And I know that
I must have you somehow.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.080
Oh.

42:23.120 --> 42:26.440
Every ship waits for the crew.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.120
He's remanded in custody.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.520
SINGING: And every
rose waits for the dew.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.680
Later today, he'll go
to court to enter a plea

42:32.800 --> 42:34.400
on a charge of armed robbery.

42:34.520 --> 42:38.400
SINGING: But I
need you right now.

42:38.520 --> 42:41.120
This is not fucking over.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.800
Not by a long shot.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.560
