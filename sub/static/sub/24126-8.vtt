WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.625 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:08.958 --> 01:12.208
Ah, I do wish that snow
would fall more neatly

01:12.208 --> 01:14.291
and now drop
all over everywhere.

01:14.291 --> 01:17.083
Ooh. I wish snow would
fall in the summer

01:17.083 --> 01:18.416
when it's warmer.

01:18.416 --> 01:22.291
I wish we could stop
for a small smackerel.

01:24.708 --> 01:25.958
Rabbit: Eww!

01:28.166 --> 01:29.458
Tigger:
Hi, everybody!

01:29.458 --> 01:31.958
Seen any fun laying around
waiting to happen?

01:31.958 --> 01:34.708
In case you haven't
noticed, Tigger,

01:34.708 --> 01:36.708
we happen to be working.

01:36.708 --> 01:40.375
Work? Ha. Why, I don't even
know the meaning of the word.

01:40.375 --> 01:44.125
I really must say this work
is a great deal of...work.

01:44.125 --> 01:46.250
Ah. It's true.

01:46.250 --> 01:49.166
If only there were
some kind of something

01:49.166 --> 01:51.333
to help us clear this snow.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.833
Hmm.
Sounds like an idea

01:53.833 --> 01:56.125
whose time has passed.

01:56.125 --> 01:59.458
Never fear, long ears.
I'm just the tigger

01:59.458 --> 02:02.333
to invent that some kind
of something for you.

02:02.333 --> 02:05.083
The only thing
you can invent, Tigger,

02:05.083 --> 02:07.000
is excuses
for not working.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.750
Huh. The accepting
of challenges

02:09.750 --> 02:12.583
is one of the things
us tiggers do the best.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.708
Why, I'll invent something

02:14.708 --> 02:17.125
the likes of which
nobody's ever seen,

02:17.125 --> 02:19.583
or my name isn't Tigger.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.125
I'm very worried, Pooh.

02:24.125 --> 02:25.708
Tigger hasn't been
out of his house

02:25.708 --> 02:27.500
for seven whole days now.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.125
Actually, Piglet,

02:30.125 --> 02:32.375
I believe it has been
closer to a week.

02:32.375 --> 02:35.333
I wonder what he's
doing in there.

02:35.333 --> 02:37.625
He's inventing
in there, that's what.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.625
And keep your voices
down.

02:39.625 --> 02:42.125
You're derailing
my train of though.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.458
I'm certain, if we
ask very politely,

02:50.458 --> 02:51.833
Tigger will come out.

02:51.833 --> 02:53.958
Please do no knock, ring bell,

02:53.958 --> 02:56.333
or otherwise
disturb the genius.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.208
Or perhaps
we should have mentioned

03:00.208 --> 03:02.250
that it's a beautiful
spring day

03:02.250 --> 03:04.125
and we're
going on a picnic.

03:04.125 --> 03:07.291
And P.S., no time
for picanics.

03:17.500 --> 03:21.583
Aw. Poor Tigger has been
in there all winter.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.000
And spring.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.083
And now all summer, too.

03:25.083 --> 03:28.250
- Uh, did we mention winter?

03:33.500 --> 03:36.500
Rabbit: This has gone on
much too long.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.583
I'll get him out
if I have to--

03:38.583 --> 03:42.958
Ah, just in time to hear me
announce my announcement.

03:42.958 --> 03:47.333
My invention is invented!

03:51.750 --> 03:55.000
Behold the dawn
of a new error.

03:57.750 --> 04:00.083
Bet you never seen
anything like that before.

04:00.083 --> 04:04.083
Well, uh, no, Tigger,
I can't say that I have.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.291
Mm, not recently.

04:06.291 --> 04:10.375
What exactly is it,
Tigger?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.500
What is it? Hoo hoo hoo!

04:13.500 --> 04:16.125
I don't know, Tigger.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.250
That's why I asked.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.583
Perhaps you'd like
a little demonstration?

04:22.875 --> 04:25.000
No more back-breaking
work for long ears.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.125
Not with this one-of-a-kind
kind of invention.

04:28.125 --> 04:31.750
Just watch how handily
it handles these vegebibbles.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.416
And better than don't,

04:43.416 --> 04:46.291
this isn't all
my invention can do.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.833
No more climbing
honey trees for Pooh,

04:48.833 --> 04:52.833
not with my invention
bringing honey trees to you.

04:52.833 --> 04:56.333
I don't think it will
fit into my cupboard.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.375
- Oh, my.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.958
Yipe!

04:59.958 --> 05:02.458
Hoo! If you think
that's something,

05:02.458 --> 05:04.625
wait till you see
how it house cleans.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.833
Piglet: Oh, dear.

05:10.833 --> 05:13.375
Why, that floor's so clean,
you can eat off it.

05:13.375 --> 05:16.333
Yes. I suppose I'll have to.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.458
Tigger,
your invention is--

05:18.458 --> 05:21.000
No, no, no, bunny boy.
I got no time

05:21.000 --> 05:23.708
for a lot of mushy-gushy
thank-you-very-muches

05:23.708 --> 05:26.000
because I feel another
invention coming on.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.333
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

05:29.000 --> 05:32.958
This meeting is to decide
what to do about we-know-who.

05:32.958 --> 05:36.375
I don't believe
I know who. Do you?

05:36.375 --> 05:38.625
I don't think it's you, Pooh.

05:38.625 --> 05:41.083
Then is it you who's who?

05:41.083 --> 05:43.250
Tigger, that's who.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.250
Oh, I'm glad
Rabbit knew.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.833
Now, if we might continue,

05:49.833 --> 05:52.250
I don't know how you feel,

05:52.250 --> 05:54.500
but speaking for myself,

05:54.500 --> 05:56.625
that invention is a menace,

05:56.625 --> 05:57.875
a disaster!

05:57.875 --> 05:59.375
We've got to get rid of it!

05:59.375 --> 06:02.333
All in favor say aye. Aye.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.250
- I--
- The ayes have it.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.500
Suggestion approved.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.833
I think I know.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.875
Is it Tigger who's who?

06:15.416 --> 06:17.708
Tigger,
I just want to say--

06:17.708 --> 06:19.166
Thank you. Thank you

06:19.166 --> 06:21.166
from the bottom
of my stripety heart.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.083
If it hadn't have
been for you guys,

06:23.083 --> 06:25.708
I never would have started
inventing inventions.

06:25.708 --> 06:27.875
And thanks to your
encouraging remarks,

06:27.875 --> 06:29.708
I've taken
the inventing of inventions

06:29.708 --> 06:31.166
to new depths.

06:31.166 --> 06:33.750
I present my new improved

06:33.750 --> 06:37.250
invention to end
all inventions!

06:37.250 --> 06:39.208
Piglet: Oh, dear.

06:39.208 --> 06:42.875
Uh, what does it do
now, Tigger?

06:44.208 --> 06:45.875
I'm glad you asked,
buddy bear,

06:45.875 --> 06:48.583
because that's the beauty
of this baby. Hoo hoo!

06:48.583 --> 06:51.708
It'll do this,
and it's a whiz at doing that.

06:51.708 --> 06:54.583
But don't forget how well
it does this and that.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.958
Why, this thing's
so super-incredibibble,

07:01.958 --> 07:03.833
it's inventing
its own inventions.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.958
Oh, d-dear.

07:10.708 --> 07:12.291
Oh, my!

07:14.250 --> 07:16.583
I must be a bigger
genius than I thought.

07:16.583 --> 07:17.875
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

07:17.875 --> 07:19.333
Oh, d-d-dear!

07:19.333 --> 07:21.875
Why, Pigalet,
I think it likes you.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.083
Oh, my!

07:23.083 --> 07:24.750
That's it, bunny boy. Hoo hoo!

07:24.750 --> 07:26.458
Take one of them
home with you.

07:26.458 --> 07:27.958
Ohh! Ohh!

07:27.958 --> 07:30.750
Keep it, Pooh Bear,
with my compliments.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.583
How gratifrying to see
satisfried customers.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.000
- Help!
- Help me!

07:36.000 --> 07:37.166
- Oh!
- Please!

07:39.625 --> 07:44.583
Oh. At least I've gotten away
from Tigger's, uh, friends.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.125
Come in.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.625
Oh, bother!

07:51.625 --> 07:54.708
Shoo! Go away!
Get out of here!

07:55.875 --> 07:56.958
Oh, my.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.375
Oh, p-please go away
and leave me alone,

08:03.375 --> 08:05.000
l-l-little inventions.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.833
Tigger, we know
you're in there,

08:10.833 --> 08:13.333
so you might as well come out.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.125
I wish I could,
bunny boy,

08:15.125 --> 08:17.291
but I'm kind of busy
at the-- whoo!

08:17.291 --> 08:20.458
Not a bath. Anything
but a b-b-bath!

08:20.458 --> 08:21.500
Help!

08:22.500 --> 08:24.166
Take no prisoners!

08:37.625 --> 08:39.375
The little guys
got carried away

08:39.375 --> 08:40.750
and carried me away.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.375
Tigger, this thing

08:42.375 --> 08:45.166
has caused nothing but
trouble from the start.

08:45.166 --> 08:49.166
Oh, I guess you're--
-- right.

08:49.166 --> 08:52.708
My inventions have been
messing things up.

08:52.708 --> 08:57.166
I'm just a flat-out,
outright, downright failure.

08:57.166 --> 09:00.708
I'll never be able to show
my handsome face again.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.833
TTFG:

09:03.833 --> 09:07.125
ta-ta for good.

09:07.125 --> 09:11.625
We can't let him not show
his handsome face ever again.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.375
Don't worry, Pooh Bear.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.125
We'll talk Tigger out
when he calms down a bit.

09:16.125 --> 09:18.875
Oh, well,
we'd better get home.

09:18.875 --> 09:22.125
It's getting late,
and this snow
is getting heavier.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.500
Piglet: Hello?
Is anyone out there?

09:26.500 --> 09:28.375
It's me: Piglet.

09:28.375 --> 09:30.458
If you have a few moments,

09:30.458 --> 09:33.708
I'd be very grateful
if you saved my life.

09:33.708 --> 09:36.458
There's nothing
to worry about, Piglet.

09:36.458 --> 09:38.250
Pooh and I are here.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.958
He's stuck till spring.

09:39.958 --> 09:44.291
Or perhaps we could help
if we had...help?

09:44.291 --> 09:45.875
Well,
I'd like to help you,

09:45.875 --> 09:48.250
but I've only been moping
for three days now,

09:48.250 --> 09:50.458
and I figure I'm just
getting started.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.875
Then we'll have
to dig him out ourselves.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.375
This is all your fault.

10:01.375 --> 10:03.708
And I ought to know
because I made you.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.458
Guess I'd better get it back

10:09.458 --> 10:12.250
before it makes somebody's
life unlivibibble.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.458
Uh, well, it's a start.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.125
- What's that?

10:20.125 --> 10:23.166
It sounds like--
Oh, no! It is!

10:23.166 --> 10:26.166
It's Tigger's
destruction on wheels!

10:26.166 --> 10:27.333
Both: Yaah!

10:27.333 --> 10:29.125
Once I get it home,

10:29.125 --> 10:31.208
I can go back
to being depressed.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.583
Oh, thank you
for digging me out.

10:39.583 --> 10:42.250
Actually, Piglet, we didn't.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.291
It was--

10:48.958 --> 10:52.458
My invention is--
-- gone.

10:52.458 --> 10:56.333
There, there, Tigger.
It gave its all
to save Piglet.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.458
If your invention
hadn't dug me out,

10:58.458 --> 11:01.375
I could have been stuck
for a very long time.

11:01.375 --> 11:03.625
Well, of course
it saved Pigalet. Hoo.

11:03.625 --> 11:07.125
I built it to clear snow
in the first place. Didn't I?

11:07.125 --> 11:09.375
Yes, Tigger, you did.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.958
And it cleared that snow
right up. Didn't it?

11:11.958 --> 11:13.750
It certainly did, Tigger.

11:13.750 --> 11:17.125
So it's oblivious
what I got to do next.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.375
It is?

11:18.375 --> 11:20.583
I'm gonna invent
another invention.

11:20.583 --> 11:23.458
It'll be stupendious,
colossical,

11:23.458 --> 11:25.500
and did I mention
monumentous?

11:25.500 --> 11:26.708
Oh, my.

11:26.708 --> 11:28.458
It'll be so incredibibble,

11:28.458 --> 11:30.000
so unbelievabibble,

11:30.000 --> 11:31.625
why, even I
won't believe it.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.416
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

11:43.625 --> 11:45.416
Thank you, Pooh.

11:45.416 --> 11:47.708
Oh, it's so
very nice of you

11:47.708 --> 11:49.625
to go out of your way
to help us.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.583
Why, you're
very welcome, Kanga.

11:54.625 --> 11:57.833
But exactly where is it
I'm going?

11:57.833 --> 12:00.833
Why, you're not
going anywhere, Pooh.

12:00.833 --> 12:05.416
You're babysitting the boys
while Owl and I go somewhere.

12:05.416 --> 12:07.875
Why do they call it
babysitting?

12:07.875 --> 12:09.875
We're not babies.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.000
It is most patronizing.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.708
It reminds me
of the time--

12:13.708 --> 12:16.291
Hoo, yes.
The care of children

12:16.291 --> 12:18.375
is life's most
important task.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.708
Isn't that right,
young Dexter?

12:20.708 --> 12:22.708
Oh, indubitably,
Cousin Owl.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.416
Come on, Dexter.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.458
Be good now, children,

12:27.458 --> 12:29.708
and pay attention
to Pooh Bear.

12:29.708 --> 12:30.875
Roo: We will, Mom.

12:32.583 --> 12:35.458
Hoo, it's so nice
to see Cousin Dexter

12:35.458 --> 12:37.125
with a playmate his own age.

12:38.375 --> 12:39.375
Oh.

12:39.375 --> 12:42.708
Well, it is much easier

12:42.708 --> 12:44.208
to put things back

12:44.208 --> 12:46.583
if they're
somewhere else first.

12:46.583 --> 12:49.208
We're sorry, Pooh Bear.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.166
We'll be delighted to assist

12:51.166 --> 12:54.250
in any recuperative
maintenance you may require.

12:55.416 --> 12:56.750
Uh, no, thank you.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.583
Just help me clean up,

12:58.583 --> 13:02.083
then perhaps we should pay
a visit to Christopher Robin.

13:02.083 --> 13:04.750
He has a much larger
house to untidy.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.583
And you can be
the more delighted

13:06.583 --> 13:08.333
to see one another there.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.333
Christopher Robin: You got
here just in time, Pooh.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.000
I've been working
very hard on this.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.416
It's my very first
science project.

13:17.416 --> 13:20.708
You know,
for a science project,

13:20.708 --> 13:24.583
it looks very much like
a box with holes in it.

13:24.583 --> 13:28.125
Silly old bear.
The science isn't the box.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.291
It's what's inside the box.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.875
Woman:
Christopher Robin,

13:31.875 --> 13:33.583
would you please
come down here

13:33.583 --> 13:34.958
and finish your homework?

13:34.958 --> 13:36.458
Okay, Mom.

13:36.458 --> 13:39.125
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

13:39.125 --> 13:42.208
Let's peek inside and see
what science looks like.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.000
Oh, d-d-dear.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.375
What if it doesn't like
being looked at?

13:46.375 --> 13:49.458
I'm certain it would
prove most edifying.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.500
Wow!

13:52.500 --> 13:55.125
So that's
a science project.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.000
It's outside,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.458
only it's inside.

14:00.458 --> 14:03.833
Tigger: Hmm. But what's
inside this inside outside?

14:08.625 --> 14:11.500
It's a-- gasp-- bug!

14:15.458 --> 14:17.375
Yipes!

14:19.375 --> 14:23.375
Hooray! We save Christopher
Robin's science project.

14:23.375 --> 14:25.375
What about
my science project?

14:27.250 --> 14:28.875
Heh heh. We saved it.

14:28.875 --> 14:31.250
There was a big
old bug in it.

14:31.250 --> 14:34.000
But we evicted it posthaste.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.083
Yeah,
then we got rid of it.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.708
But that bug
was my science project.

14:39.708 --> 14:43.458
If I don't have a bug,
the whole thing
will be ruined.

14:43.458 --> 14:46.166
Ha ha! Don't worry,
Christopher Robin. Ha ha!

14:46.166 --> 14:48.083
We're even better
at catching bugs

14:48.083 --> 14:49.291
than losing them.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.500
Thanks, guys.

14:51.708 --> 14:53.000
But, Pooh Bear,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
where would a bug,
being a bug, be?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.458
I don't know, Piglet.

14:59.458 --> 15:01.000
I'm not a bug.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.500
Aw, hoo hoo, any bug
worthy of the name

15:04.500 --> 15:06.583
is usually bugging Rabbit.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.458
Go, go, go, go.

15:35.458 --> 15:38.333
All right,
you thieving pipsqueaks,

15:38.333 --> 15:41.083
I know you're out there.

15:41.083 --> 15:45.833
Aha! I'm going to get
every one of you bugs

15:45.833 --> 15:47.625
If it's the last thing I do.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.166
Retreat! Fall out!

15:49.166 --> 15:51.958
Why, you were right, Tigger.

15:51.958 --> 15:54.458
Rabbit seems to have
a great many bugs.

15:54.458 --> 15:58.166
We'd better grab one
before old long ears
flattens them all.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.875
Come out and fight
like, well, like bugs.

16:01.875 --> 16:04.416
Hiya, bunny boy.
We need a bug.

16:04.416 --> 16:05.875
You got one to spare?

16:05.875 --> 16:08.208
A bug? What for?

16:08.208 --> 16:11.583
Don't you know the only
good bug is, well,

16:11.583 --> 16:13.333
there aren't any good bugs.

16:13.333 --> 16:15.125
Please, Rabbit.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.208
Yes. Without a bug,

16:17.208 --> 16:19.583
Christopher Robin's
science project

16:19.583 --> 16:21.958
will be most unscientific.

16:21.958 --> 16:24.958
Fine. Grab any bug
you like.

16:24.958 --> 16:27.708
I have an entire garden
full right here.

16:27.708 --> 16:30.625
Tigger: Looks like they
bugged out on you.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.500
Piglet:
What will we do now?

16:32.500 --> 16:36.458
Hunt them own like
the dastardly little
crawlies that they are.

16:36.458 --> 16:39.625
Tigger, can Dexter
and I go, too?

16:39.625 --> 16:43.583
Yes. As the ones who inspired
the insect's escape,

16:43.583 --> 16:47.500
we share primary responsibility
for his replacement.

16:48.583 --> 16:49.750
Nope.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.500
Bug hunting is too dangerous

16:51.500 --> 16:52.875
for kid types.

16:52.875 --> 16:56.333
Dangerous? Oh, dear.

16:56.333 --> 16:59.000
Pooh will keep us
safe on the quest.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.250
won't you, Pooh?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.458
What's a quest?

17:04.458 --> 17:06.166
Out of the question.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.708
You'll just have to stay
behind with Pooh

17:08.708 --> 17:10.083
where you'll be safe.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.500
And I suppose
I'll have to go along,

17:12.500 --> 17:15.250
or Christopher Robin
will never get another bug.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.583
Hmm.

17:16.583 --> 17:20.875
Bug hunting.
Of all the silly ideas.

17:20.875 --> 17:24.166
Oh, dear. How can we
correct our error

17:24.166 --> 17:27.000
if we can't accompany
the bug hunting expedition?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.583
I have an idea.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.375
See you, Pooh.

17:31.375 --> 17:32.750
See you, Roo.

17:32.750 --> 17:36.125
Uh, see you where, Roo?

17:36.125 --> 17:38.166
Where it's safe, Pooh.

17:38.166 --> 17:40.375
We're not going
bug hunting.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.375
We're going bug meeting.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.750
That's nice.

17:44.750 --> 17:49.250
Oh, bother. I don't think
I can babysit Roo and Dexter

17:49.250 --> 17:51.500
without Roo and Dexter.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.583
I'd better go
bug meeting, too,

17:54.583 --> 17:56.375
whatever that is.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.291
I don't believe
I encountered

18:00.291 --> 18:02.416
this part of the Wood before,
Roo.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.375
Me, neither.

18:04.375 --> 18:08.083
Perhaps Tigger was right about
bug hunting being dangerous.

18:08.083 --> 18:10.000
I don't think
it's the hunting part

18:10.000 --> 18:11.708
that we have to worry
about.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.291
It's finding our way home
afterwards.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.750
Roo: It sure is
spooky out here.

18:28.458 --> 18:31.333
Hoo, losing our way
is, I fear,

18:31.333 --> 18:34.583
the consequence of misleading
our appointed guardian.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.291
I guess you're right.

18:36.291 --> 18:38.708
But we do owe
Christopher Robin a bug.

18:40.750 --> 18:44.416
Yum yum. Eat 'em up.

18:44.416 --> 18:47.166
And all we got is lost.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.625
We may be temporarily
misplaced,

18:49.625 --> 18:51.875
but at least
we won't go hungry.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.583
Wait a minute.
Where's our lunch?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.333
And I'm really hungry, too.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.875
I wonder if we should
ever see our companions

19:02.875 --> 19:05.000
or another meal again.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.458
Poor little guys.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.750
What are we going to do?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.291
Both: Aah!

19:15.958 --> 19:17.333
Roo: Look. A bug.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.625
We found one after all.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.750
I do so hope he's friendly.

19:21.750 --> 19:23.875
And he found our lunch.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.958
Hey, Mr. Bug,
won't you join us?

19:35.958 --> 19:36.958
Thank you.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.583
All we need now

19:38.583 --> 19:40.166
is to find our way home.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.750
I'm afraid
the mathematical
probabilities

19:42.750 --> 19:46.375
of anyone coming
to our rescue
are astronomical.

19:46.375 --> 19:49.166
Hello, Roo. Hello, Dexter.

19:49.166 --> 19:51.625
I'm sure glad Pooh Bear
doesn't know anything

19:51.625 --> 19:55.208
about, uh,
grammatical probables.

19:55.208 --> 19:56.458
Indubitably.

19:56.458 --> 19:59.875
How nice. You met a bug.

19:59.875 --> 20:02.458
A big bug.

20:04.416 --> 20:06.875
Won't Christopher Robin
be happy.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.875
Dexter,
if we take him back,

20:10.875 --> 20:13.583
they'll put him
in that dark old box

20:13.583 --> 20:15.583
maybe forever.

20:15.583 --> 20:18.000
Oh, how discomforting.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.875
But Christopher Robin
did say

20:19.875 --> 20:23.000
that his science project
was extremely important.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.125
My. This looks far more
like bug hunting

20:26.125 --> 20:28.208
than bug meeting to me.

20:28.208 --> 20:29.625
Tigger:
Right, buddy bear.

20:30.958 --> 20:33.583
We're up here
working on "stragety."

20:33.583 --> 20:36.708
- Tigger.
- And Piglet and Rabbit.

20:36.708 --> 20:39.958
Never. Never again.

20:42.083 --> 20:43.708
Christopher Robin:
He's huge.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.000
I'm going to have the
best science project

20:46.000 --> 20:47.458
in the whole class.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.375
Uh, Christopher Robin.

20:52.375 --> 20:53.875
Yes, Roo?

20:53.875 --> 20:55.875
He's kind of our friend.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.708
Yes. And we wish to know

20:57.708 --> 21:00.458
if he will have to remain
a science project forever.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.708
Don't worry, guys.

21:02.708 --> 21:04.875
As soon as I show him
in school tomorrow,

21:04.875 --> 21:05.958
I'll let him go.

21:05.958 --> 21:07.333
Really?

21:07.333 --> 21:09.000
That's great!

21:10.875 --> 21:14.166
Just what I need:
another bug,

21:14.166 --> 21:16.250
and such a hungry one.

21:17.833 --> 21:19.875
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.

21:22.125 --> 21:23.583
Goodbye.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.291
Uh-uh.
Hold it right there.

21:34.291 --> 21:35.583
Huh-uh. Uh-uh.
No, no, no.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.583
Aww.

21:41.875 --> 21:42.875
Wow!

21:55.166 --> 21:57.958
Do you know what Dexter
and I think, Pooh?

21:57.958 --> 22:01.291
Why, no, Roo.
I don't believe I do.

22:01.291 --> 22:05.333
We agree that you are
a most proficient babysitter.

22:05.333 --> 22:08.458
Indubitably.
