WEBVTT

00:14.933 --> 00:16.900
(EXHALES) What, uh, what's
happening is I got up,

00:18.933 --> 00:22.367
went out, tossed my old coffee
water out this morning,

00:22.767 --> 00:24.633
and there's caribou right
across the runway.

00:24.867 --> 00:26.700
Really unusual
for this time of year.

00:26.767 --> 00:29.033
Problem is, on this landscape,

00:29.100 --> 00:31.233
there's almost no way
to sneak up on them.

00:37.067 --> 00:40.233
They look close, but they are
actually 300 yards out.

00:43.233 --> 00:44.600
Ah! There they go.

00:46.667 --> 00:48.700
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:13.133 --> 01:14.133
(RELOADS GUN)

01:16.767 --> 01:19.800
That's every bit
of 500 yards there.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.433
They're just too far out.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.600
What's that? Hello.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.167
I don't see anything that
tells me I've injured one.

01:27.467 --> 01:29.867
So now I'll go and see
if I can lay up a better shot.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.700
Winter hunting is...

01:35.267 --> 01:36.400
A son of a bitch.

01:36.467 --> 01:39.433
I'm not wearing
inconspicuous colours.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.067
This makes noise.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.667
All of these things are...
Are not in your favour

01:44.733 --> 01:46.233
when you're trying
to get an animal.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.433
They shouldn't be here now.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.267
It's still a month,
two months early,

01:50.333 --> 01:51.600
for them to even be here.

01:56.933 --> 01:59.333
Just like I use
the foxes to tell me

01:59.400 --> 02:00.967
where the animals are at,

02:01.033 --> 02:03.000
the caribou are using
the animals, too.

02:03.067 --> 02:05.467
When ptarmigan go,
"Oh, my God!"

02:05.533 --> 02:06.767
And they flock up,

02:06.833 --> 02:08.800
they know to head
in the opposite direction

02:08.867 --> 02:10.467
because there's something
spooking 'em.

02:10.867 --> 02:11.967
You know, if they're in here,

02:12.033 --> 02:13.900
it's way easier to lay
in a plan of attack.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.200
If they're out in the open,

02:15.267 --> 02:16.800
it's just damn
near impossible.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.567
The best course
of action for me

02:21.000 --> 02:22.833
to have success hunting today,

02:23.533 --> 02:25.300
I'm gonna bag on the caribou

02:25.700 --> 02:26.933
and I'm gonna get the .22

02:27.000 --> 02:28.733
and I think I'm gonna go
for Ptarmageddon.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.000
I saw so many
ptarmigans out there,

02:31.067 --> 02:34.400
that what I need to do is
put food in the freezer.

02:34.467 --> 02:35.467
How I do it,

02:35.967 --> 02:38.367
is in the manner I'm gonna
be the most successful.

02:38.633 --> 02:40.733
A bird in a hand's worth
two caribou in the bush.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.767
CHIP HAILSTONE:
There's no social
security benefits to this.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.300
There's no retirement to this.
There's just death.

02:48.733 --> 02:49.733
That's what I look forward to.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.100
You ladies got your hats
and you're ready to go?

02:59.167 --> 03:01.467
-BOTH: Yeah.
-You need a mini goggles, too.

03:01.533 --> 03:02.933
'Cause it's gonna be
kicking up snow.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.967
But I... We tried to make you
a nice little protection thing

03:05.033 --> 03:06.567
so it doesn't just fly
straight into your face.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.167
It's prime fishing season now,

03:08.233 --> 03:09.567
and, uh, we just wanna go look

03:09.633 --> 03:12.000
and see if we could
find a school of fish

03:12.067 --> 03:15.567
under the ice, so me,
Chip, Ting, and Carol

03:15.633 --> 03:18.233
are going out into
the new camp at Emonakrov.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.700
This camp down there,

03:19.767 --> 03:21.567
it's a place
where we had received

03:21.633 --> 03:23.400
new titles from my grandma,

03:23.467 --> 03:25.267
so, um, we have
a tent frame down there

03:25.333 --> 03:27.033
that Chip made this fall,
and now that

03:27.100 --> 03:28.900
the ice is thick enough
and we can travel,

03:28.967 --> 03:31.567
we're gonna go spend
a first night down there.

03:31.633 --> 03:33.900
And hopefully
we'll be fishing out

03:33.967 --> 03:35.800
some pretty nice-sized fish.

03:36.333 --> 03:37.500
That's everything, eh?

03:38.100 --> 03:40.767
Uh, I got a couple traps
I wanna set down there,

03:40.833 --> 03:42.500
so I was gonna put these
on top of my stuff.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.633
You know, since we're gonna
be down there permanently,

03:45.000 --> 03:46.633
I figure why not
just have some traps

03:46.700 --> 03:47.933
to start to set that way.

03:48.233 --> 03:50.000
And then in, uh,
dark winter when I'm here,

03:50.067 --> 03:52.267
I could use that for
a roundabout. It just depends.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.400
First what I wanna do is

03:53.467 --> 03:54.900
get to learn
that area down there,

03:54.967 --> 03:57.133
see what it has to offer,
and then figure out

03:57.200 --> 03:59.267
what time of year
I'd wanna be there and, uh,

03:59.333 --> 04:01.267
what it'll, what it'll turn
out to be for us.

04:01.633 --> 04:02.867
There might be
stagnant times of year

04:02.933 --> 04:03.967
when you don't
wanna be down there.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.633
Never know. We don't know.
It's like a new adventure.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.000
So, our plan is to
just outfit the place

04:09.067 --> 04:11.400
with the proper tools
and start testing the waters

04:11.467 --> 04:12.467
and see what's there.

04:25.267 --> 04:27.433
AGNES: This is something
I'm looking forward to.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.167
It's, um, a new place
for the girls,

04:29.233 --> 04:33.033
but yet a place where
I've been all through
my growing years,

04:33.100 --> 04:37.233
and, um, I hope these girls
will find it their home, too.

04:56.267 --> 04:57.267
AGNES: Wow!

04:58.500 --> 04:59.667
CHIP: Slick, huh?
AGNES: Yeah,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.600
-it's on the platform, too?
-CHIP: Yup.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.867
How's this sound?
About three bends up,

05:03.933 --> 05:05.567
there was a dead moose
beside the...

05:05.633 --> 05:07.600
Beside the side
of the bank there.

05:07.667 --> 05:08.967
It's kind of frozen
into the ground there.

05:09.033 --> 05:10.167
Did you see
its ribs sticking out?

05:10.233 --> 05:11.600
-TING: Yeah.
-I'm gonna go back there

05:11.667 --> 05:12.933
and go put a couple
of my traps there.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.667
Or at least one
and maybe one closer.

05:14.733 --> 05:16.033
-Is that okay?
-We'll just unpack, huh?

05:16.100 --> 05:17.300
CHIP: Yeah,
just unpack, please.

05:17.367 --> 05:18.567
I'll be back in a little bit.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.367
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
I don't think
this is for everybody.

05:27.433 --> 05:28.567
Unfortunately, there are
a lot of people

05:28.633 --> 05:30.033
that aren't doing
what they love to do.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.867
I've had this little caribou
hanging in the closet

05:44.933 --> 05:46.433
for the last four days
thawing out.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.800
It was frozen solid.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.433
Now it should be thawed out
enough that I can skin it

05:50.500 --> 05:52.033
and cut it up
into smaller pieces.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.467
NARRATOR:
For Glenn Villeneuve,
hunting is an essential tool

05:56.533 --> 05:58.333
for surviving
in the Brooks Range.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.600
And utilising
every piece of his kill

06:00.667 --> 06:03.233
is key to maintaining
his subsistence lifestyle.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.533
GLENN: This little caribou
will have enough meat on it

06:09.600 --> 06:11.100
to feed me
for a couple of weeks.

06:11.867 --> 06:12.900
And the hide.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.533
I'll make into a blanket.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.733
It's got a really warm fur,
on a caribou.

06:21.367 --> 06:23.400
Every animal is different
when you go to skin it.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.233
Some animals require
a lot more work with a knife.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.600
Others, like a caribou,

06:28.067 --> 06:29.500
you can tear a lot of the skin

06:29.567 --> 06:31.233
right off with
just your hands.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.467
It's actually faster
and more efficient.

06:33.767 --> 06:35.267
These are the warble flies.

06:35.867 --> 06:38.433
Those are the maggots,
live underneath the skin.

06:41.533 --> 06:42.533
(GRUNTS)

06:43.633 --> 06:44.633
There!

06:45.367 --> 06:48.067
There. That'll make a nice
warm blanket for my bed.

06:50.467 --> 06:52.400
Cutting it up
into smaller pieces,

06:52.467 --> 06:54.400
the legs, the ribs, the back.

06:54.767 --> 06:57.667
Each time I wanna eat
something I take it out
and let it thaw overnight.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.000
Now, a big caribou
will last me a month,

07:00.067 --> 07:02.467
but this little guy here will
barely last me two weeks.

07:02.633 --> 07:05.467
One of these shoulders, gosh,
I can eat that in a day.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.233
(BONES CRACKING)

07:09.967 --> 07:12.567
I got this little caribou all
cut up into small pieces now.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.567
And every bit of it's
gonna be useful to me.

07:14.633 --> 07:15.667
I got meat here,

07:16.100 --> 07:17.800
I got marrow in the bones,
even in the hooves,

07:17.867 --> 07:19.867
and I got a hide there
to make a blanket out of.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.633
I'm just gonna throw
some snow over it

07:21.700 --> 07:23.067
to keep the birds off
while I go inside

07:23.133 --> 07:24.267
and start working
on that hide.

07:38.367 --> 07:40.167
ANDY BASSICH:
I'm not real paranoid
about predators.

07:40.233 --> 07:41.800
They gotta be
paranoid about me.

07:41.867 --> 07:43.267
I'm on the top
of the food chain.

07:44.867 --> 07:46.000
You guys wanna go for a run?

07:46.300 --> 07:48.100
Who wants to go
set some traps?

07:48.767 --> 07:51.033
Oh, Topaz does. (LAUGHS)

07:51.100 --> 07:52.100
You ready to go?

07:52.367 --> 07:53.733
We're gonna go
downriver today.

07:54.333 --> 07:55.900
Now I'm gonna
hook up the dogs,

07:55.967 --> 07:57.333
and head downriver,

07:57.633 --> 07:58.867
set some traps for the day,

07:58.933 --> 08:01.100
try and get that done before
it gets too dark here

08:01.167 --> 08:04.067
and hopefully we'll catch some
little fur, some big fur, and

08:04.733 --> 08:07.467
I can put together a hat and
make something up later on.

08:07.733 --> 08:08.733
We'll see how it goes.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.800
(DOGS BARKING)

08:10.800 --> 08:11.800
Hup! Hup!

08:17.733 --> 08:18.733
Straight ahead!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.967
Okay, easy. Haw! Haw! Haw!

08:22.367 --> 08:23.767
Attaboys, easy.

08:23.833 --> 08:26.000
Easy. Easy.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.400
Whoa, easy.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.967
The thing about trapping,
you just gotta go out,

08:30.033 --> 08:33.467
set the traps. It's a...
It's a big crap shoot
most of the time.

08:33.567 --> 08:35.933
So you set where it's likely
and then, uh,

08:36.400 --> 08:37.533
it's a waiting game.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.467
Trapping is one
of these things that I...

08:41.533 --> 08:43.467
I have a lot of
mixed emotions about.

08:44.867 --> 08:46.567
I really don't like
killing stuff,

08:47.233 --> 08:50.633
but part of living out here
is you gotta...
You gotta kill to eat.

08:51.167 --> 08:53.067
And you gotta kill to clothe.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.400
You know, that's, that's
a part of living out here

08:55.467 --> 08:57.133
and I've learnt
to deal with it.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.167
Okay, everybody, whoa.

09:02.967 --> 09:03.967
Ho!

09:04.967 --> 09:06.100
Ho! Ho!

09:06.167 --> 09:07.400
Good, everybody stay.

09:07.967 --> 09:10.400
So this is probably gonna be
kind of deep snow
out on the lake here,

09:10.467 --> 09:14.167
but I think it's gonna
be worthwhile to go
over to that area and try

09:14.233 --> 09:15.900
and get rid of
some of these traps.

09:16.567 --> 09:19.067
And that way if multiple
animals come through,

09:19.133 --> 09:23.767
you have different types of
equipment out there to...
To harvest those animals.

09:26.367 --> 09:28.167
I got some
old tracks right here.

09:28.533 --> 09:29.867
Those are lynx tracks.

09:31.133 --> 09:33.067
Kind of a roundy,
you can kind of see...

09:34.067 --> 09:37.300
Right here there's these nice,
rounded little pads.

09:37.967 --> 09:42.600
So that's good.
I think I'm gonna just walk up
into this draw a little bit.

09:52.267 --> 09:54.500
I'll try and set the trap
right in here.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.667
When you're working
with traps, you always
have to be paying

10:07.733 --> 10:10.133
really close attention
to where you're
putting your hands.

10:11.467 --> 10:13.333
This is the part
I always don't like...

10:14.267 --> 10:15.733
Getting my hands in there.

10:19.433 --> 10:20.700
It's a hair trigger.

10:21.967 --> 10:23.700
That's why you don't
put your hands in there.

10:24.133 --> 10:25.600
(LAUGHS)

10:26.233 --> 10:29.267
Let's try round two,
let's put the paper under,
in there first.

10:29.333 --> 10:32.633
What this wax paper
does is it keeps
the snow off the trigger.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.300
If you don't put something
like this over the trigger,
it'll just freeze shut.

10:39.667 --> 10:43.433
Yeah, I feel pretty good
that at some point in time
within the next couple weeks,

10:43.500 --> 10:44.933
something's gonna
walk through here.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.633
It might be a fox.
It might be a lynx.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.267
Potentially a wolf.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.833
I mean, even a wolverine
bounding through here
could do something.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.100
So, yeah.

10:54.233 --> 10:57.800
I think I'm gonna set a few
snares around here
since I'm in this nice tangle.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.000
I'm liking that pretty good.

11:19.067 --> 11:21.433
That makes a nice,
tight little hole right there.

11:21.633 --> 11:24.300
Now we just have to do
the old adage, time will tell.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.867
So that looks pretty good.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.767
I'll get on out of here
and I'll come back,

11:29.567 --> 11:31.000
see if we got something.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.367
CHIP: We're hunters,
not farmers.

11:36.433 --> 11:37.867
We chase it down to kill it

11:37.933 --> 11:40.333
and we get
instant satisfaction or
we get nothing at all.

11:56.867 --> 11:58.600
This here's a dead moose,
all right,

11:58.667 --> 12:00.533
that's pretty well-embedded
into the river.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.867
It's gonna make a good bait.

12:01.933 --> 12:03.333
Animals will
keep coming to this.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.700
This thing's frozen solid,

12:04.767 --> 12:06.633
it's a real
big attractor to animals,

12:06.700 --> 12:08.467
and the fact
is that dead animals

12:08.533 --> 12:10.067
don't get eaten up
in just one day,

12:10.367 --> 12:13.033
and, uh,
it's a great bait, so...

12:13.100 --> 12:15.300
It's natural, it's in sight,
and I'm gonna use it.

12:15.867 --> 12:18.667
Get the
springs set on these guys.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.933
Well, this trigger doesn't
wanna fucking move over.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.767
They're not
a complicated trap,

12:29.833 --> 12:30.833
but, um,

12:31.233 --> 12:34.167
you've always got everything
sliding and bending and

12:34.467 --> 12:37.700
shit moving and it
fucking tries to kill.

12:39.667 --> 12:40.667
Well...

12:40.933 --> 12:43.233
It's just a little too tough
and my hands are frozen.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.800
Well, these are
very thin gloves.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.433
And this metal
here is very cold

12:47.500 --> 12:48.933
and it's, like,
3 below right now.

12:49.567 --> 12:52.300
When you're trying to do this,
and your hands are cold
and you get clumsy,

12:52.367 --> 12:53.733
you're just flirting
with disaster.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.200
So I'm just gonna
take a few minutes

12:55.900 --> 12:57.633
and get some feeling
back in my hands and

12:58.267 --> 12:59.400
carry on slowly.

12:59.467 --> 13:00.900
I've been down
this road many times.

13:00.967 --> 13:04.100
I just know it takes patience.
I just gotta be patient.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.700
As long as I'm patient,
it'll happen.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.933
I'll try it one
more time here.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.600
It's getting to be
a pain in the butt.

13:15.667 --> 13:16.667
That's okay, too.

13:18.267 --> 13:19.400
Ah, there it goes.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.100
Okay, I got the springs done.

13:23.467 --> 13:25.633
Now let's go over here where
we're gonna set this baby.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.267
I think I'm actually
just gonna set it in here.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.500
Probably right
on top of the hole.

13:32.933 --> 13:34.733
As long as an animal
doesn't smell me out,

13:35.233 --> 13:36.433
this sucker's ready to go.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.767
Have some bone shards around.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.300
You know,
a little bit of anything,

13:42.367 --> 13:45.233
a little bit of everything
a fox or another animal
really might like

13:45.400 --> 13:46.400
and that would...

13:46.633 --> 13:47.933
That would be marrow for sure.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.133
And it's already
in a well-established hole.

13:50.967 --> 13:53.533
I got one more trap,
and I'm thinking,

13:54.233 --> 13:55.867
you know, I'll get
one more out there.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.667
I got a double set right here.

13:59.433 --> 14:02.400
When I got a trap going,
the trap is hunting
all night for us.

14:02.533 --> 14:04.267
When we go fishing,
we're actively fishing,

14:04.333 --> 14:06.700
so we can be down there
jigging away fishing

14:06.767 --> 14:08.167
and the traps
will be right here

14:08.233 --> 14:10.333
waiting for something to come
along and try to take a bite.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.533
So I could get
a nice predator fur

14:12.767 --> 14:15.200
and a fish meal
all at the same time.

14:15.433 --> 14:16.433
It's pretty cool.

14:17.933 --> 14:19.767
I'm gonna leave this one
out here in the obvious.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.833
Maybe they'll move over
to that one.

14:22.367 --> 14:23.733
That's kind of
what I'm thinking.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.467
We'll come back in the morning
and check it out.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.833
You know,
it's just the first set,
first time, first night,

14:28.100 --> 14:29.100
and, uh,

14:29.433 --> 14:30.500
we'll just see how it goes.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.200
GLENN: It feels different

14:45.267 --> 14:46.633
when you're wearing
animal skins

14:46.700 --> 14:48.467
and you're sleeping
on animal skins.

14:48.533 --> 14:50.467
It connects you to the whole
environment out here.

14:50.533 --> 14:51.833
That's what it's all about.

15:05.267 --> 15:08.133
The animals provide
a lot more
than just food for me.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.267
Hides are very useful.
I use animal hides
for my clothing.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.367
I use animal hides
for my bedding.

15:15.233 --> 15:18.467
There are even certain bones
that I use for tools out
of a caribou.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.633
This caribou hide's gonna
make a nice blanket.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.467
You don't just rip
a caribou hide off

15:22.533 --> 15:25.200
of the caribou
and start sleeping on it,
it's gotta be cleaned up.

15:25.667 --> 15:29.767
There's still fat on here,
there are these warble fly
maggots that I'm cleaning off.

15:30.067 --> 15:33.133
Warble flies lay eggs
on caribou...

15:34.167 --> 15:35.233
In their fur.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.700
In the summertime,
when the eggs hatch,

15:36.767 --> 15:39.567
little maggots bore
under the skin,

15:39.867 --> 15:43.000
down on the legs usually,
and then they migrate up
to the back.

15:43.167 --> 15:44.600
They're kind of a pain
because they

15:45.333 --> 15:47.000
degrade the hide.

15:47.667 --> 15:51.000
Some people find it
kind of tedious,
but I just have to work,

15:51.067 --> 15:52.433
taking all that stuff off.

15:52.767 --> 15:54.967
You want the hide to last,
you don't want any fat

15:55.033 --> 15:57.033
or junk that's gonna
be rancid on it

15:57.233 --> 15:59.567
without cutting holes
through the hide,
that's the big thing.

15:59.633 --> 16:01.467
It's a very
delicate operation.

16:01.533 --> 16:05.400
The goal is to get the hide
flexible, soft after it dries.

16:05.467 --> 16:08.367
Mostly it's by scraping,
sometimes chewing on it.

16:08.433 --> 16:11.033
'Cause what you'll see is
you'll actually see it turn
into leather.

16:11.267 --> 16:13.133
Like right here, if you just
chew it a little bit.

16:19.933 --> 16:21.967
You know, in old days,
people used to chew
hide all the time.

16:22.433 --> 16:24.000
Saliva actually helps it.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.700
A lot of people don't
get to do stuff
like this any more.

16:26.767 --> 16:28.267
Everybody used to do this.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.700
Everybody used
to work on hides.

16:29.767 --> 16:31.067
That was just

16:31.133 --> 16:32.500
a normal way of life.

16:32.767 --> 16:34.433
It's a special feeling
when you've got

16:34.933 --> 16:36.967
your food and your bedding

16:38.033 --> 16:41.333
on a mountain that you can see
right out the window
while you're in your cabin.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.267
That's what
subsistence living is.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.867
It's just nice, it's like
doing the dishes,
it's like chopping firewood.

16:46.933 --> 16:47.933
Working on a hide.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.667
You see the results,

16:50.133 --> 16:51.767
right in front of your eyes.

16:51.833 --> 16:52.867
Look at that.

16:53.433 --> 16:54.500
Isn't that beautiful?

16:55.833 --> 16:57.467
That's gonna
make a beautiful blanket.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.167
I like it.

17:02.933 --> 17:05.600
SUE: It's all good fuel
for my personal fire.

17:05.867 --> 17:08.233
Susie gets to keep on
burning her way through life.

17:18.933 --> 17:20.300
What I'm gonna do,

17:21.933 --> 17:23.033
is, uh,

17:23.833 --> 17:26.233
I'm gonna go down
this way into the riverbed,

17:27.200 --> 17:30.000
and just hopefully fill up
my bucket with ptarmigans.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.600
But I know the animals here,

17:32.800 --> 17:34.233
there is a pattern,
the sun is out,

17:34.300 --> 17:36.233
they're doing good,
we're supposed
to get a blizzard,

17:36.300 --> 17:37.300
they're gonna
be here and gone.

17:37.733 --> 17:39.867
I'm gonna back up,
get in there,

17:40.400 --> 17:42.733
and hopefully have a case
of Ptarmageddon today.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.167
Foxy! Coming with?

17:45.467 --> 17:46.467
(MAKES KISSING NOISES)

17:46.533 --> 17:47.533
Dum-Dum!

17:49.900 --> 17:53.733
My biggest worry right now
is zeroing in on
a flock of ptarmigan.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.900
It's one of the only
food sources out here
for a lot of the year.

17:56.967 --> 17:58.833
You don't exactly see
a whole lot of food

17:58.900 --> 18:00.800
running around out here
on the tundra.

18:02.067 --> 18:04.167
I got one up over there,
I think.

18:04.233 --> 18:05.567
Got a lot more up there.

18:05.633 --> 18:07.367
That whole bush is
covered in 'em.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.233
What I see up here

18:09.933 --> 18:12.600
is more ptarmigans,
the little white cotton balls.

18:13.033 --> 18:14.033
(COCKS GUN)

18:22.367 --> 18:23.367
(BREATHS HEAVILY)

18:25.300 --> 18:26.600
Hunting's pretty good.

18:28.533 --> 18:29.567
In the end,

18:30.500 --> 18:31.500
you know...

18:32.567 --> 18:36.300
Yeah, I could spend the day
going after a caribou.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.233
But right here,

18:38.800 --> 18:42.533
I'm expending energy
but I've got instant benefit.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.767
All I'm gonna do is
angle back that way,

18:46.833 --> 18:49.533
and if I see something,
take some more shots.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.567
It is good to know,
where does
your food come from?

18:58.633 --> 19:01.967
It is good to know
how to be responsible

19:02.033 --> 19:04.400
for your own carbon footprint
on this planet.

19:04.467 --> 19:06.467
I know where
this ptarmigan's been.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.633
I know what it's been eating.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.833
It doesn't have anything to do
with injections, antibiotics
and growth hormones.

19:13.900 --> 19:17.233
That's something that
I want my grandkids
and my kids to be able to do

19:17.300 --> 19:19.067
and then pass on
to their families.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.267
So what I'm gonna do,

19:29.067 --> 19:30.100
is try to get...

19:32.967 --> 19:35.267
Try to get the breast
and I take...

19:35.333 --> 19:37.733
Put my thumb
underneath this portion,

19:38.167 --> 19:39.167
lift it up...

19:41.600 --> 19:43.133
Find that nice little pumper,

19:44.167 --> 19:46.067
toss 'em in, that's a keeper.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.000
And I'll finish
cleaning it off inside.

19:48.233 --> 19:50.267
I've got lots of nice
little breast meat here,

19:50.333 --> 19:52.467
I'm gonna make myself
some soup stock,

19:53.233 --> 19:54.967
I'll get the meat,

19:55.900 --> 19:57.333
I love the little hearts.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.767
I mean, I may take a fair
amount of bullets doing it,
but I had a lot of fun today.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.233
CHIP: I think I see it as
all being really good.

20:11.433 --> 20:14.033
Because even
the worst day of fishing
is better than being at work.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.800
Whoo, that wind, huh?

20:18.967 --> 20:21.067
Whoo! It's cold out here
this morning.

20:22.267 --> 20:24.267
It ain't so cold as
it is the wind, girls.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.767
If I were you, I would just
stay inside and work in there,

20:27.833 --> 20:30.667
'cause your hands are
gonna get chilly out here.

20:30.733 --> 20:31.900
AGNES: Is there a wind?

20:32.067 --> 20:33.567
CHIP: There's a wind for sure.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.567
It's, uh, it's cold.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.400
This morning's just starting.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.233
Had some coffee,

20:40.700 --> 20:44.033
and right now I'm gonna
gas up and make sure
that the ladies can

20:44.400 --> 20:45.867
do a little bit
of fishing out here.

20:45.933 --> 20:47.900
They're getting some
fish jiggers put together.

20:47.967 --> 20:49.567
We came down here to see
what the fishing's like.

20:49.633 --> 20:51.933
We don't know how good it'll
be or how good it won't be.

20:52.267 --> 20:54.467
But, um, you don't know
till you try.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.733
(MACHINE BUZZING)

21:02.100 --> 21:03.933
I know the channel's fairly
deep right here,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
and, uh, since we got
a new camp going on here,

21:06.500 --> 21:09.233
the best thing we can do
right now is find out
what resources there are.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.600
The only thing up against us
today is this wind.

21:12.633 --> 21:15.267
If the wind gets stronger,
we might not fish long.

21:15.333 --> 21:18.267
You just simply get
chilled sitting still jigging,
you know, in the wind.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.533
But, we'll see.

21:30.167 --> 21:31.933
This is basically
what we call a jigger.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.500
I'm gonna sit there
and put this through the hole

21:33.567 --> 21:35.500
and I'm gonna jig it up
and down in the hole.

21:35.833 --> 21:38.233
The folks up here have
been using these things
for thousands of years.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.700
They don't have any fancy
spinning device to break.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.467
Don't have any eyelets
to go through.

21:42.533 --> 21:44.467
The method is to
just jigger up and down.

21:45.433 --> 21:46.567
Any luck yet?

21:46.633 --> 21:48.400
CHIP: (LAUGHS)
Just got it wet.

21:50.533 --> 21:51.900
Hey, babe. You look ready.

21:53.133 --> 21:54.833
It's nice to come
down here and, uh,

21:54.900 --> 21:58.433
check out the new
properties we acquired.

21:58.667 --> 22:02.067
The time to go fishing
is now, so, uh,
except for the wind,

22:02.133 --> 22:04.000
it just started to get
a little breezy here,

22:04.067 --> 22:08.000
and these rivers
has never failed
my mother and her mother,

22:08.067 --> 22:11.333
so I don't see why they should
fail me and my girls.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.100
CHIP: And just keep it moving.
Just gently.

22:13.167 --> 22:15.133
And when you feel a weight,
then you really have to lift.

22:15.633 --> 22:16.633
Just keep it moving.

22:17.333 --> 22:20.567
AGNES: And not make movement
by your hole too much.

22:20.633 --> 22:21.667
No.

22:22.833 --> 22:26.233
I'm just pretty much
just taking
some of the, um,

22:26.700 --> 22:31.700
snow away from her ice
so the snow don't just keep
filling her ice hole,

22:31.767 --> 22:35.800
so we just try to pile it up
and make a little wind block.

22:36.600 --> 22:39.733
Keeps us a lot warmer that way
while we're standing here.

22:42.333 --> 22:43.367
CHIP: You feel something?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.133
Don't be too discouraged
if we don't come up
with nothing here.

22:49.633 --> 22:51.967
That's why it's called
fishing, Bun, not catching.

22:52.033 --> 22:54.967
AGNES: Fishing takes
a lot of time once
you get under the ice,

22:55.033 --> 22:56.833
and then you sit here
for hours and hours,

22:56.900 --> 23:00.333
and sometimes days and days
just, um, jigging.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.600
We're just gonna give it a try
and see how our luck is.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.267
CHIP: This wind
is picking up, ladies.

23:06.333 --> 23:07.600
AGNES: Yes, it is.

23:08.367 --> 23:10.100
Come on, fish!

23:14.533 --> 23:16.467
GLENN: I was looking
all over the world

23:16.533 --> 23:19.100
for a place to kind of live
close to nature like this
and I ended up, up here.

23:24.167 --> 23:26.333
I have to keep hunting.
And the caribou are around us.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.000
I've seen signs of them,
I've seen a few caribou

23:28.067 --> 23:29.467
just a couple days
ago across the lake,

23:29.533 --> 23:30.800
so I'm gonna
keep hunting today.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.767
Go out there and see if I can
connect with another caribou.

23:34.533 --> 23:37.167
Whenever
I'm hunting for caribou,
I start right at home.

23:37.233 --> 23:39.867
I'm always watching,
right here from
the front yard.

23:39.933 --> 23:42.733
Right from the lake
just in front of my camp,
I get a good view.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.700
I can look all around
and see if there are any
caribou to go after.

23:45.767 --> 23:47.800
If I can't find
any caribou from here,

23:47.867 --> 23:49.367
then I have to walk
further and look.

23:49.433 --> 23:51.567
But I always start looking
right here in my yard.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.933
I like to keep my hood down
as much as I can

23:55.000 --> 23:56.567
just so I can see better
and hear better,

23:56.633 --> 23:59.000
but right now,
it's about 50 below.

23:59.067 --> 24:00.967
And that's extremely cold.

24:01.033 --> 24:04.100
It's cold weather to hunt in
but I can hunt in these
temperatures when I have to.

24:04.833 --> 24:06.667
There I see
some caribou tracks.

24:07.100 --> 24:10.200
They're real hard to make out
because of this
flat grey light.

24:10.267 --> 24:12.267
The sun isn't up
above the horizon yet.

24:13.233 --> 24:16.067
If I keep looking I might find
the caribou themselves.

24:17.733 --> 24:19.500
Two important things
to know about caribou.

24:19.567 --> 24:20.733
They're gregarious,

24:20.800 --> 24:22.633
if you find one,
you'll often find others.

24:22.967 --> 24:24.767
And they're
long-distance migrators,

24:24.833 --> 24:27.600
they travel hundreds
and hundreds of miles
over the course of the year.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.467
So just because
you see caribou,

24:29.533 --> 24:31.033
doesn't mean they're gonna
be here tomorrow.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.267
You gotta take advantage of
opportunities when they come.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.367
You can never have
too much meat out here.

24:38.433 --> 24:41.233
You got a couple months of
meat stored up on the cache,

24:41.767 --> 24:45.033
but two months later,
there might not be
a caribou in sight.

24:45.500 --> 24:46.767
Or anything else to eat.

24:51.967 --> 24:55.067
I don't see any caribou
on these mountains
that I can see from this spot.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.367
There are a lot of places
I can't see from here.

24:58.567 --> 25:00.100
If there are caribou
in the forests

25:00.167 --> 25:02.567
or if there are caribou
on other lakes
down the valley,

25:02.867 --> 25:05.200
I won't know unless
I walk down there and look.

25:19.633 --> 25:20.933
I think I see some.

25:22.067 --> 25:23.833
Hey, caribou! Caribou!

25:30.400 --> 25:31.467
(GLENN SPEAKING)

25:33.400 --> 25:35.033
It's not.
But there are caribou around.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.700
I've seen
caribou tracks already,

25:36.767 --> 25:38.633
but I'm gonna go
a little further along on
the edge of the lake.

25:40.733 --> 25:41.733
Look at this.

25:44.933 --> 25:47.833
These are caribou tracks
and they're fairly fresh.

25:49.033 --> 25:50.833
By looking at the tracks,

25:50.900 --> 25:52.000
the feeling of 'em...

25:53.567 --> 25:54.667
I can get an idea

25:55.533 --> 25:57.400
about which way
these caribou are moving.

25:57.733 --> 25:59.533
When I see some tracks
like this, it's exciting,

25:59.600 --> 26:01.467
'cause I know the caribou are
moving through this area.

26:01.533 --> 26:02.867
There's still caribou around.

26:03.433 --> 26:08.067
But, I also know
that caribou move
a long ways in a short time.

26:08.333 --> 26:11.167
And the chance of me
catching up with these caribou
right here is minimal,

26:11.233 --> 26:12.767
so I'm not gonna follow them.

26:12.833 --> 26:14.367
I'm gonna continue
along the lake.

26:14.433 --> 26:17.500
They're
long-distance migrators,
and there are times

26:17.567 --> 26:19.200
when there are caribou passing
through the valley

26:19.267 --> 26:20.833
and then times
where months will go by

26:20.900 --> 26:22.367
and there are no caribou
at all in the valley,

26:22.433 --> 26:25.567
so this is encouraging to see
that there are caribou around.

26:25.633 --> 26:28.833
So, I'm gonna keep going,
see what I find up ahead.

26:35.167 --> 26:36.767
CHIP: It's really cool
getting things done

26:36.833 --> 26:39.067
in the same way people
have been doing
for thousands of years,

26:39.133 --> 26:40.600
simply because it's abundant,

26:40.667 --> 26:43.133
it's there, it's healthy
and it's the right
thing to do.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.000
AGNES:
Did you all's get nibbles?

26:52.967 --> 26:54.700
No nibbles? Darn!

26:55.533 --> 26:57.133
Here, Agnes.
Why don't you take this one?

26:57.200 --> 26:58.633
I'm gonna jump
on the snow machine

26:58.833 --> 27:00.167
and I'm gonna go
check that trap.

27:00.233 --> 27:01.833
We got about half
an hour of sunlight.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.533
And the wind
is really picking up.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.267
That's quite possible.
We'll go see.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.267
Anyway, I'll be back
in about a half-hour.

27:10.333 --> 27:11.367
Before sundown.

27:11.767 --> 27:13.133
I hope you guys
catch something.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.733
NARRATOR: The Hailstones are
spending their first day
at the new camp in Emonakrov,

27:18.800 --> 27:20.733
to harvest
the area's resources.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.233
While Agnes and the girls look
for sheefish under the ice,

27:24.633 --> 27:26.067
Chip must check his traps

27:26.133 --> 27:29.167
before the sun sets
and conditions
become dangerous.

27:29.233 --> 27:32.200
Well, the sun's gonna
be going down in about
half-hour, 45 minutes,

27:32.267 --> 27:34.400
and I've got a couple
of traps set about

27:34.467 --> 27:37.033
a couple miles away from here
on a dead moose carcass.

27:37.300 --> 27:38.567
The wind is really picking up,

27:38.767 --> 27:40.333
and these ladies
are continuing to fish

27:40.400 --> 27:42.600
but, um, right now
it's probably zero,

27:42.667 --> 27:46.033
but the wind
is picking up like
15 with gusting to 20, 25.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.233
And it makes it
a little too cold
to wanna stick around, so...

27:49.600 --> 27:52.000
So if that's the case,
you know, we wanna
keep it enjoyable.

27:52.067 --> 27:54.167
We'll just go home.
It's an hour-and-a-half
from here.

28:18.667 --> 28:21.133
Well, we got one trap
that's sprung

28:21.200 --> 28:23.300
and another trap that
has the safeties on it.

28:24.067 --> 28:25.900
I don't really understand
what happened here.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.433
Now, this one was set off.

28:30.633 --> 28:32.267
I don't know
what snapped it off.

28:32.333 --> 28:34.867
I would assume either
a weasel or something
smaller than this trap

28:35.100 --> 28:36.400
to set this trap off.

28:36.767 --> 28:38.533
But this one
I don't understand at all.

28:39.033 --> 28:42.067
Oh, well. It's not for me
to understand everything
in this world.

28:42.133 --> 28:46.000
The fact is, I set these,
I probably almost
had something.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.000
I couldn't tell you
what the tracks are

28:48.067 --> 28:50.533
because the wind is blowing
in a ground storm right now,

28:50.833 --> 28:51.967
and it's starting to fill in,

28:52.333 --> 28:54.100
and even if I left
these traps here,

28:54.333 --> 28:55.933
set, they would fill in.

28:56.533 --> 28:59.233
And I would probably
not catch anything, so...

29:00.433 --> 29:01.933
Well, basically,
the sun's going down,

29:02.000 --> 29:03.667
so I'm gonna go home and see
what kind of decision

29:03.733 --> 29:06.700
the ladies have made.
They might wanna, um,
stay another night here

29:06.767 --> 29:09.267
if the fishing's
any good right now
or they might wanna go home.

29:09.700 --> 29:12.300
Me myself, I'm, uh, I'm gonna
take these traps with me.

29:12.367 --> 29:13.933
If the ladies wanna
stay the night out,

29:14.033 --> 29:15.600
maybe I'll put 'em
in a different location

29:15.667 --> 29:17.367
or maybe
I'll put 'em back here again.

29:17.433 --> 29:20.200
But for myself,
I just gave it a try.

29:35.133 --> 29:36.567
ANDY: I try and keep positive.

29:36.633 --> 29:38.633
Positive thoughts
bring positive results.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.200
-All right.
-(DOGS BARKING)

29:41.700 --> 29:42.767
(LAUGHS)

29:43.633 --> 29:45.900
Oh, boy. Let's go check traps.

29:46.533 --> 29:49.067
I've had traps out
for a few days now and...

29:49.833 --> 29:51.833
And hook up the dogs.
I've got a fairly good day,

29:51.900 --> 29:54.233
it's kind of socked in
a little bit, but not too bad.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.133
We'll go see
if we can find some fur!

29:57.767 --> 29:58.767
Come on, Foge.

29:59.567 --> 30:01.067
(DOGS BARKING AND WHINING)

30:03.467 --> 30:04.500
Hup!

30:06.767 --> 30:07.867
Attaboy, Carb.

30:17.067 --> 30:18.267
I never get tired

30:18.333 --> 30:20.767
just walking through
these open woods like this.

30:21.467 --> 30:23.000
This is beautiful
back in here.

30:23.067 --> 30:25.267
Even if you don't catch
any fur, you...

30:25.333 --> 30:26.567
You kind of feel like...

30:27.767 --> 30:31.033
You've had a really nice
experience in the woods.

30:32.533 --> 30:34.867
All right. Let's go see
if we got anything.

30:35.733 --> 30:38.033
That almost looks like
a place where the lynx were

30:38.300 --> 30:40.667
chasing after rabbit.

30:43.333 --> 30:46.333
You gotta have
the prey if you wanna
get the predators.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.567
Well, it doesn't look like
anything in this Conibear.

30:55.267 --> 30:57.033
That's kind of disappointing.

30:57.100 --> 30:58.800
Everything I do
out here is just,

30:58.933 --> 31:00.467
a little bit here,
a little bit there,

31:00.533 --> 31:02.833
a little bit over here
to make this life.

31:05.933 --> 31:07.967
You don't make
your living all on one thing

31:08.533 --> 31:10.400
but if you lose
one of those components

31:10.467 --> 31:12.367
it can really
impact your life a lot.

31:13.033 --> 31:14.533
Looks like I'm skunked again.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.367
No marten in this one.

31:17.433 --> 31:20.033
No fresh tracks around,
no critters in the traps

31:20.100 --> 31:21.133
and, uh,

31:21.767 --> 31:24.600
it's a little demoralising,
a little frustrating, but

31:25.267 --> 31:26.833
I just have to go
to the next place

31:26.900 --> 31:29.500
and hopefully I'll get
a little bit of fur, but...

31:30.400 --> 31:31.933
That's the game this is.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.333
Let's go check the rest
of the trap line, guys.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.633
Ho! Let's go!

31:39.333 --> 31:40.400
Easy.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.167
Easy.

31:42.733 --> 31:43.733
Easy.

31:44.133 --> 31:46.000
Easy. Ho, ho.

31:46.067 --> 31:47.800
I'm coming up to an area that

31:48.300 --> 31:49.600
I've got quite a few sets...

31:49.667 --> 31:52.333
Couple of marten sets
and a wolverine set.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.567
Ah, these guys are picking up.
They smell something.

31:54.900 --> 31:56.467
You guys smell something, huh?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.133
Ho, ho, ho!

31:58.200 --> 31:59.267
Hey. Look at that.

32:00.033 --> 32:01.033
Yee-haw.

32:02.067 --> 32:03.433
Got a little bit of fur!

32:04.400 --> 32:05.433
Everybody stay.

32:05.967 --> 32:06.967
All right.

32:07.700 --> 32:08.900
We've got some fur.

32:09.967 --> 32:11.233
Nice little marten.

32:12.267 --> 32:14.767
He's not a giant
but I'll take it.

32:16.833 --> 32:17.933
Yeah.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.467
Well, that made my day.

32:21.533 --> 32:23.100
I was beginning
to get pretty...

32:23.833 --> 32:26.400
Pretty bummed out here
not catching anything,

32:26.467 --> 32:29.867
so... At least we got one.
Right, Shilling?

Hup!

Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:42.033 --> 32:44.000
We almost missed
that one, you guys.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.200
All right.

but it's starting
to pick up a little bit.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.367
Yeah, boys!

33:00.333 --> 33:01.333

33:09.500 --> 33:10.533
Oh, yeah.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.267
Hey, that's
a nice-size marten, too.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.167
That's two on
the bottom and...

33:16.267 --> 33:17.600
That guy's
a nice-sized marten.

33:17.667 --> 33:20.100
He barely fits in my tote.

33:20.167 --> 33:22.867
Turn around
and head on home and

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
get these marten thawed out
and do some skinning.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.833
Won't be able
to do that tonight,
they're all frozen.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.233
All in all,
this was a good effort.

Ho!

33:47.333 --> 33:50.467
SUE: You achieve success
by jumping back on that horse

33:50.767 --> 33:52.733
not by selling it
and buying a kitten.

34:04.733 --> 34:06.600
Hunting is a part of what I do

34:06.667 --> 34:10.300
and it's a very important part
of my lifestyle.

34:10.367 --> 34:12.833
However,
it does not define me.

34:12.900 --> 34:14.167
I need the food

34:14.467 --> 34:16.867
but I don't lose sight of
saying, "Thank you, birdies."

34:17.533 --> 34:18.567
Without them...

34:19.833 --> 34:20.833
I wouldn't be here.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.500
Some spices.

34:26.467 --> 34:28.567
I'm gonna let 'em
just kind of marinate.

34:28.933 --> 34:31.567
I put the spices on 'em,
I put the oil on 'em,

34:31.933 --> 34:35.033
and I am going to cover up
those ptarmigan breasts,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.933
let all those spices
make out with the meat...

34:40.233 --> 34:42.200
So that that flavour soaks in.

34:42.467 --> 34:44.567
Today was just
a really good day.

34:44.633 --> 34:46.033
I went after the caribou,

34:46.100 --> 34:47.933
didn't get 'em,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.467
but in the process
of trying to get the caribou,
I saw all the ptarmigan.

34:50.533 --> 34:51.900
I changed gear,

34:51.967 --> 34:55.033
went over and went
after the ptarmigan

34:55.100 --> 34:57.267
and now I have
several week's worth of food.

34:57.600 --> 35:01.067
The bird, the land,
the air, the snow,

35:01.133 --> 35:03.367
everything that makes up
the beauty of the Arctic

35:03.433 --> 35:05.267
all in a little bitty bite.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.200
Ptarmigan soup, even better.

35:15.933 --> 35:17.933
GLENN: In order to take
advantage of opportunities,

35:18.000 --> 35:19.667
you have to learn the country
and you have to learn

35:19.733 --> 35:21.700
where things are happening
and when they're happening at.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.233
NARRATOR: Glenn is searching
for caribou,

35:28.500 --> 35:30.833
a crucial food source
in dark winter.

35:31.267 --> 35:34.533
But tracking the animals
requires him to cross
the frozen lake

35:34.833 --> 35:38.067
and any mistake while walking
on the ice can be fatal.

35:38.667 --> 35:40.800
I can see some spots
where there's water

35:40.867 --> 35:42.400
coming up under the snow.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.400
It's called overflow
and it's very dangerous.

35:45.833 --> 35:48.400
Since the last time I went out
at camp, it's snowed a lot.

35:49.467 --> 35:50.933
And this deep snow,

35:51.767 --> 35:54.467
pushes the ice down
into the water.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.600
Water works its way out
through the ice

35:56.667 --> 35:58.933
in certain places,
it actually will melt holes

35:59.000 --> 36:01.367
right through the ice,
even when it's 50 below zero.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.700
Those holes
are called spider holes

36:04.067 --> 36:05.967
and looking down here
with binoculars,

36:06.367 --> 36:09.100
I can see some places
where there's spider holes
on the lake.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.167
That's not good.

36:10.633 --> 36:12.567
I gotta be careful
crossing the lake.

36:12.633 --> 36:14.600
Make sure I do not
get into the overflow

36:14.667 --> 36:16.500
and do not fall
into a spider hole.

36:17.233 --> 36:19.900
If I get my feet wet,
I'm finished out here.

36:28.133 --> 36:29.133
Whoa.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.467
I can feel something...

36:31.800 --> 36:32.933
That's dangerous.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.733
I'm on snowshoes,
so it's holding me
up on top of the snow,

36:36.900 --> 36:39.600
but under this snow
it's not solid ice.

36:39.667 --> 36:40.833
There's overflow.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.700
It's a layer of slush
and it can be pretty deep.

36:43.767 --> 36:45.133
It's 40 below zero.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.333
If I fall into that overflow,
I can freeze my feet.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.233
It'll build up all over
the snowshoes,

36:51.300 --> 36:53.500
you can get totally stuck
in it, it's very dangerous.

36:53.967 --> 36:57.133
The water has spread out
all under the snow here
ahead of me.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.967
I gotta move off
the lake here.
It's too dangerous.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.800
I have to leave the lake
here and go through
the forest for a ways

37:07.867 --> 37:09.133
because of the overflow.

37:09.833 --> 37:12.033
Normally, it's easier
travelling on the lake.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.833
Much easier because it's flat.

37:13.900 --> 37:16.167
In the forest, the ground
is rough and uneven.

37:16.233 --> 37:17.533
It's harder to travel.

37:17.833 --> 37:20.033
But the lake's too dangerous
with that overflow.

37:28.267 --> 37:30.300
From up here
I can see 'em a little bit.

37:30.967 --> 37:33.500
When you're down on the lake,
they're very hidden.

37:33.933 --> 37:35.700
If I fell on a spider hole,
I'd be dead.

37:35.767 --> 37:38.033
If I step in the overflow
in these temperatures,

37:38.333 --> 37:39.467
I'll freeze my feet.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.133
I might be past the overflow.

37:59.067 --> 38:00.433
Right here it feels all right.

38:02.267 --> 38:04.933
It doesn't feel like there's
any overflow under my feet.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.700
I'm gonna try
and hug the shoreline.

38:06.767 --> 38:08.233
But it's a lot easier

38:08.300 --> 38:10.167
out here on the lake
than it is in the forest

38:10.233 --> 38:11.867
where the ground's
so irregular.

38:23.133 --> 38:24.133
There.

38:24.567 --> 38:26.100
We made it over
to the far side of the lake.

38:26.167 --> 38:28.133
Broke out about
a mile-and-a-half trail today.

38:29.267 --> 38:31.000
I didn't find
any caribou today.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.567
But that's typical.

38:32.867 --> 38:36.400
I'll go out hunting 10, 12
times before I find caribou.

38:36.467 --> 38:38.900
It's not uncommon.
I just have to keep watching,

38:38.967 --> 38:41.433
take advantage of
opportunities when
they come up,

38:41.500 --> 38:43.200
and now I've got
a trail that I can utilise

38:43.267 --> 38:44.733
to get more quickly
to the other side

38:44.800 --> 38:46.700
of the lake when I see
caribou over this way.

38:52.367 --> 38:55.067
ANDY: For me, it's all about
being utilitarian,

38:55.433 --> 38:58.033
using the product for how it
was intended to be used.

39:10.300 --> 39:12.333
I've got my, uh,
day's catch here.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.567
I had a really good day.

39:13.633 --> 39:15.200
I was getting skunked and then

39:15.267 --> 39:17.667
the last four
or five sets on my, uh,

39:17.733 --> 39:20.133
check on my line,
I nailed, uh,

39:20.200 --> 39:23.300
four really nice marten
here, so, it's time
to skin 'em.

39:23.367 --> 39:25.300
I brought 'em inside
and thawed 'em all out.

39:25.433 --> 39:28.600
They're gonna make
some really nice fur
products for me.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.600
I'll probably end up making
a nice marten hat out of this.

39:32.233 --> 39:33.600
Fur is king

39:33.800 --> 39:36.600
and there's nothing
better than fur
to keep you warm

39:36.667 --> 39:38.300
up in these northern climates.

39:38.367 --> 39:40.533
And fur is
a great skill to know

39:40.600 --> 39:42.367
if you're gonna live up north,
because it's something

39:42.433 --> 39:44.300
that nature
can provide for you.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.367
So once
I get 'em to this point,

39:49.433 --> 39:50.933
a lot of times
I like to hang 'em up,

39:51.633 --> 39:53.633
so I can work
on 'em a little bit better.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.700
Very little goes to waste.

39:57.267 --> 40:00.033
You wanna kinda take
your time and get
it started pretty good.

40:00.833 --> 40:03.967
Then you can pretty much just
pull straight down on 'em.

40:04.033 --> 40:06.033
I'll just drop 'em
on the board.

40:07.733 --> 40:09.500
The way they grade
these furs is

40:09.567 --> 40:12.600
the length from the nose here
to the base of the tail.

40:12.667 --> 40:14.233
That's what you get graded on.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.700
So the longer it is,

40:17.133 --> 40:19.000
within reason, the better.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.033
First thing I like to do is

40:21.100 --> 40:23.000
once they're on
the board like this,

40:23.233 --> 40:24.433
I'm just taking

40:25.300 --> 40:27.333
the lower legs,
stretching 'em out.

40:28.133 --> 40:31.233
You're just trying
to expose the flesh

40:31.600 --> 40:32.733
so it'll dry out.

40:34.833 --> 40:38.533
I like to just tack 'em
on gently first.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.067
The final thing you do
is take a

40:42.633 --> 40:44.633
stretcher here,
you stick that up in there,

40:44.700 --> 40:46.533
if you don't do that
the skin dries so tight

40:46.600 --> 40:48.467
that you won't be able
to get it off the board.

40:48.867 --> 40:52.700
This allows you to have
something you can remove,
leaves a little bit of

40:53.767 --> 40:55.167
slackness in the fur.

40:56.467 --> 40:59.500
Just needs to dry tonight,
I want this
to feel like paper.

40:59.733 --> 41:02.667
Tomorrow morning,
I'll probably come in
with a cup of coffee,

41:02.967 --> 41:04.400
turn all these marten around

41:04.467 --> 41:06.333
and put 'em back on the board,

41:06.400 --> 41:07.867
let 'em dry
for a couple more days

41:07.933 --> 41:09.033
and then they're
ready for tanning

41:09.133 --> 41:11.033
and making a hat out of.

41:11.867 --> 41:14.367
If I can take fur
and make something out of it,

41:14.433 --> 41:16.100
it has a much higher value,

41:16.167 --> 41:18.733
not only monetarily
but personally for me.

41:20.067 --> 41:21.533
The fur I trapped today

41:21.600 --> 41:23.967
is gonna keep me warm
for many years to come.

41:27.967 --> 41:30.267
AGNES: Every day's a learning
experience for these girls.

41:30.333 --> 41:31.967
Even me, I try to tell them,

41:32.033 --> 41:35.100
even though I'm old
I still learn something
new every day.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.500
Getting pretty windy out here.

41:44.400 --> 41:47.300
Even though we keep trying,
we ain't catching any fish.

41:47.367 --> 41:49.233
We're lucky
we built these, uh,

41:49.300 --> 41:50.933
little wind breaks for us,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.533
'cause this wind
is really whipping it up.

42:00.367 --> 42:02.333
CHIP: No fish?
AGNES: No fish!

42:02.400 --> 42:03.400
CHIP: Ah, shucks.

42:03.933 --> 42:06.500
-That's fishing!
-How about the trap?

42:06.567 --> 42:10.233
Oh, I don't even think
I had a good time
with that one.

42:10.300 --> 42:12.933
You guys wanna stay another
night and try to keep fishing?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.167
Or do you wanna
call it a weekend

42:14.233 --> 42:16.233
and just head back
and go eat dinner at home?

42:17.467 --> 42:19.033
I think we're about done here.

42:19.100 --> 42:21.133
This is get... The wind
is starting to get

42:21.200 --> 42:23.133
strong enough
to blow in our face.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.333
CHIP: Well, let's go home.

42:25.867 --> 42:27.000
Well, you know,
we came down here,

42:27.067 --> 42:28.300
we wanted to show
the girls this camp

42:28.367 --> 42:30.433
that their grandmother
once owned this place.

42:30.500 --> 42:33.000
And that her mother
and grandmother had
once fished here.

42:33.067 --> 42:34.600
I mean, these
are Inupiats right here

42:34.667 --> 42:37.067
and these folks have been
on this land for 10,000 years.

42:37.133 --> 42:40.367
And to see my wife
and kids flow
in that direction,

42:40.433 --> 42:41.500
I think that's pretty cool.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.300
Well, let's go home.

42:44.033 --> 42:45.167
What we're taking out
of here today

42:45.233 --> 42:47.100
isn't gonna be fish,
it isn't any fur.

42:47.167 --> 42:49.367
We're gonna take out of here
a little bit of story,

42:49.433 --> 42:51.967
a lot of culture, and family
connection between my wife

42:52.033 --> 42:53.767
and the daughters
and the actual ways

42:53.833 --> 42:55.433
that they make
a living around here.

42:56.167 --> 42:58.900
Someday, when me
and Agnes are dead
and rotting in the ground,

42:58.967 --> 43:00.900
their grandkids
will be down here.

43:00.967 --> 43:01.967
I hope so.
