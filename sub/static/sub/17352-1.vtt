10:28.480 --> 10:29.469
- Help!

10:30.880 --> 10:31.869
Help!

12:28.680 --> 12:31.672
- The papacy of Pius X||| starts today.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.111
The cardinals are still in the Vatican.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.829
They'll leave Rome
only after the first homily of the new Pope.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.470
- May God, who has enlightened
every heart, help you

16:32.560 --> 16:35.154
to know your sins and trust in His mercy.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.949
- Your sins, Voiello?
- Tommasino, don't waste my time.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.838
My sins have to do with high finance
and diplomacy.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.471
Even if I were to confess them,
you wouldn't understand a thing.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.548
- So confess those I can understand.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.558
- I've had impure thoughts.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.429
- About whom?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.279
- About the Venus of Willendorf.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.235
- Who's she?

16:56.320 --> 16:59.835
- The Paleolithic statue the Pope
keeps in his library.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.510
lt's 25,000 years-old.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.869
- lmpure and gerontophilic thoughts
about a statue...

17:10.640 --> 17:12.835
What sort of penance can I assign for that?

17:13.040 --> 17:14.837
You're making things difficult for me, Voiello.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.680
- You think about it and let me know.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.353
I'm in a hurry.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.073
- Behold the Naples trinity.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.278
- Federico.
- Your Eminence.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.510
- Do you know how many books
have been written about me?

24:47.720 --> 24:50.154
- Seventeen.
- Eighteen.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.549
The last one's going to press next week,

24:52.640 --> 24:54.517
and it's got the best title of all.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.069
- Which is?
- The Man Behind the Scenes.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.751
- Beautiful!
- Of course, I suggested it myself.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.959
- Who wrote it?
- Manna, that leftist reporter.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.675
- That means it's going to be critical
of you, Your Eminence.

25:08.760 --> 25:09.875
- Of course, those are the best.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.430
They turn you into a legend.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.829
Don't overdo it now, or people
will know you're faking it.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.274
- Forgive me, Eminence,
but that was a good one.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.635
- You should laugh, but in proportion.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.034
Valente.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.555
His Holiness?

25:33.640 --> 25:34.834
- He's at the heliport.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.314
- Hejust got here,
and he already wants to leave?

25:38.120 --> 25:40.156
Now you could have laughed a little more.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.708
- He sent me to tell you he'll be a bit late
for your meeting, Eminence.

25:43.320 --> 25:46.073
- Okay, but if you see him,
tell him not to be too late,

25:46.320 --> 25:49.039
because I, unlike him, have a lot to do.

25:49.120 --> 25:53.671
I've got to steer this boat,
which that indecisive fisherman Peter left me.

25:55.920 --> 25:56.909
Valente.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.149
What do you make of him?

25:59.800 --> 26:01.313
- He's a man of little appetite.

26:01.840 --> 26:02.875
Actually...

26:02.960 --> 26:04.075
very little.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.632
- This is not a good sign.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.669
Not a good sign.

44:23.800 --> 44:24.789
- Pope!

49:35.880 --> 49:40.078
- Federico, do you know why
all the good souls of this world

49:40.560 --> 49:42.198
rage against power?

49:42.600 --> 49:44.158
- Why, Your Eminence?

49:44.560 --> 49:47.597
- Because they simply don't know what it is.

49:48.920 --> 49:50.273
- What is it?

49:51.360 --> 49:53.430
- Power is knowledge.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.558
- What is it you want to know, Eminence?

49:59.840 --> 50:01.398
- Who is Pius XIII?

50:01.840 --> 50:03.990
Or rather, who was Lenny Belardo?

50:05.320 --> 50:09.552
You need to carry out a small investigation,
discreet but thorough.

50:10.680 --> 50:14.309
His weak spots,
his trials and tribulations, his sins.

50:15.720 --> 50:17.073
Especially his sins.

50:17.680 --> 50:22.356
Because the sins we commit in the past
are the same ones we'll commit in the future.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.477
Because man is like God:

50:26.480 --> 50:28.118
He never changes.

50:29.160 --> 50:30.434
- I'll start right in.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.599
But is the situation of this papacy
already that serious?

50:33.680 --> 50:35.193
- No, not yet.

50:35.640 --> 50:37.278
But if it were to become so,

50:37.680 --> 50:38.999
we'll be ready.

50:41.160 --> 50:43.628
Because the powerful may have knowledge,

50:45.680 --> 50:48.831
but they don't realize what it takes
to be more powerful than everyone else.

50:51.280 --> 50:53.032
- And what does it take?

50:55.840 --> 50:58.718
- It takes getting knowledge
before anyone else does.
