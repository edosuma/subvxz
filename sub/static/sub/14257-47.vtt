01:06.869 --> 01:09.534
I HAVE THE DISTINCT FEELING
SHREDDER AND KRANG

01:09.602 --> 01:12.034
WON'T BE
BOTHERING US ANYMORE.

01:12.102 --> 01:15.667
BETTER YET, THAT'S THE LAST
WE'LL SEE OF THE TECHNODROME.

01:15.734 --> 01:20.999
YEAH, IT'S CIAO FOR NOW
FOR THOSE BOGUS BUDS.

01:21.034 --> 01:22.832
WHAT WAS THAT?!

01:26.966 --> 01:29.530
THE TECHNODROME!

01:29.565 --> 01:31.130
PUT THE PEDAL
TO THE METAL, DUDETTE!

01:31.198 --> 01:33.596
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ASK ME TWICE!

01:33.765 --> 01:35.463
THOSE WRETCHED REPTILES!

01:35.530 --> 01:37.796
I'LL FINISH THEM
THIS TIME.

01:37.863 --> 01:39.862
YOU MAY TAKE
THE CREDIT,

01:39.964 --> 01:44.662
BUT IT'LL BE MY TECHNODROME
THAT DOES IT FOR YOU.

01:44.696 --> 01:47.094
LET'S NOT QUIBBLE
ABOUT DETAILS, KRANG.

01:47.162 --> 01:51.128
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
THE TURTLES WILL BE NO MORE.

01:52.528 --> 01:55.760
PREPARE MISSILE LAUNCHERS!

01:55.861 --> 02:00.225
OH, NO! SHREDDER'S
BRINGING OUT THE GONZO GUNS!

02:00.294 --> 02:01.992
HEAD FOR THE HILLS!

02:04.725 --> 02:07.524
I'LL REDUCE THEM TO ATOMS!

02:14.691 --> 02:18.922
DRINK BLAZING ELECTRIC
DESTRUCTION, TURTLES.

02:19.023 --> 02:21.588
ENOUGH!
YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.

02:21.689 --> 02:24.920
BESIDES, YOU'RE
MIXING YOUR METAPHORS.

02:25.022 --> 02:27.153
KRANG, YOU'RE SUCH
A WET BLANKET.

02:27.221 --> 02:30.086
OOH, CAN I HAVE
A SHOT AT THEM, BOSS?

02:30.187 --> 02:33.352
IT AIN'T NICE
TO KICK THEM
WHEN THEY'RE DOWN.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.619
THAT'S THE BEST TIME.

02:45.918 --> 02:48.583
YOU KNOW, I GET
THE DISTINCT FEELING

02:48.650 --> 02:50.849
SHREDDER IS
TICKED OFF AT US.

02:53.183 --> 02:56.381
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT
WHAT KRANG AND SHREDDER
ARE UP TO.

02:56.449 --> 02:58.681
THIS TIME WE'LL NEED
ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.

02:58.749 --> 03:01.047
WE'LL HAVE TO GO BACK
AND GET MASTER SPLINTER.

03:01.115 --> 03:03.280
THEN YOU BETTER HELP ME
DIG OUT THE NEWS VAN.

03:03.348 --> 03:05.947
IT'S A LONG WALK BACK
TO THE CITY.

03:09.213 --> 03:10.812
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.679
I GOT TO GET
TO MY JOB!

03:12.747 --> 03:14.978
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN IT
TO THAT THING?

03:22.745 --> 03:25.410
OH, BOY, IS THAT GONNA
RAISE OUR HIGHWAY TAXES!

03:35.742 --> 03:38.540
MASTER SPLINTER,
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

03:38.608 --> 03:39.306
THE TECHNO--

03:39.441 --> 03:41.605
I KNOW. THE TECHNODROME
HAS SURFACED

03:41.673 --> 03:44.705
AND IS ROLLING OVER
ANYTHING IN ITS PATH.

03:44.707 --> 03:47.838
WOW! HOW DID YOU
KNOW THAT, MASTER?

03:47.906 --> 03:49.804
DID IT COME TO YOU
IN A VISION?

03:49.873 --> 03:52.904
DID YOU HAVE A MYSTICAL
REVELATION WHILE MEDITATING?

03:52.972 --> 03:55.603
NO. I SAW IT ON
THE 5:00 NEWS.

03:55.739 --> 03:58.037
THE ENTIRE NATION
IS IN A PANIC

03:58.105 --> 04:01.202
AS THE HUGE BATTLE MACHINE
KNOWN AS THE TECHNODROME

04:01.270 --> 04:03.535
ROLLS OVER EVERYTHING
IN ITS PATH.

04:03.603 --> 04:05.769
OH, IT'S VERNON!

04:05.837 --> 04:08.335
WAIT TILL I GET
MY HANDS ON HIM!

04:08.402 --> 04:10.367
<i>STEALING MY STORY!</i>

04:10.469 --> 04:11.768
BOY, I HATE
TO SAY IT,

04:11.835 --> 04:14.600
BUT THIS TIME
HE REALLY MIGHT
CONQUER THE WORLD.

04:14.568 --> 04:16.632
VERNON? NO WAY!

04:16.701 --> 04:18.366
HE JUST WANTS
TO BE AN ANCHORMAN.

04:18.434 --> 04:20.732
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT KRANG!

04:20.800 --> 04:23.964
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR THE FINAL CONFRONTATION

04:24.032 --> 04:26.031
WITH OUR ANCIENT ENEMY.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.097
BUT, MASTER, HOW ARE
WE GONNA DO IT?

04:28.165 --> 04:29.298
WE'LL NEVER
STOP SHREDDER

04:29.365 --> 04:31.264
AS LONG AS
HE'S INSIDE
THE TECHNODROME.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.030
THAT THING IS
HUMONGOUS!

04:33.098 --> 04:35.996
YOU FORGET THE WAY
OF THE FOOT CLAN, MY SON.

04:36.064 --> 04:38.562
THE SIZE OF YOUR OPPONENT
DOES NOT MATTER.

04:38.631 --> 04:41.562
HIS OWN EVIL
WILL BE HIS UNDOING.

04:41.629 --> 04:42.762
THAT MAKES SENSE.

04:42.863 --> 04:46.127
NOW, LET US
FINISH THIS FIGHT

04:46.195 --> 04:49.293
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

04:49.361 --> 04:52.393
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY ARE WE HEADING WEST?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.026
THERE'S NOTHING OUT HERE.

04:54.093 --> 04:55.493
I WANT TO DO SOME DAMAGE!

04:55.560 --> 04:57.725
I WANT TO
DESTROY SOMETHING!

04:57.860 --> 04:59.191
ME, TOO, BOSS.

04:59.260 --> 05:01.525
I WANT TO DESTROY
SOMETHING!

05:03.026 --> 05:05.257
YOU NEARLY
DESTROYED MY FOOT,

05:05.325 --> 05:06.757
YOU HONKING HORNHEAD!

05:06.791 --> 05:09.957
STOP THAT
BLASTED SQUABBLING.

05:10.025 --> 05:13.588
MY PLAN IS TO HAVE
THIS ENTIRE PLANET

05:13.656 --> 05:16.854
UNDER OUR CONTROL
BY NIGHTFALL.

05:16.922 --> 05:20.521
BUT IT WILL REQUIRE
MASSIVE AMOUNTS
OF POWER,

05:20.589 --> 05:24.288
AND I KNOW JUST
WHERE TO GET IT.

05:25.488 --> 05:27.953
I DON'T GET IT.
THEY'RE HEADED WEST.

05:27.988 --> 05:29.685
WHY DO YOU
SUPPOSE THAT IS?

05:29.754 --> 05:33.419
MAYBE THE DUDES WANT
TO BUY A DUDE RANCH. HA HA.

05:33.487 --> 05:36.119
LOOK! THERE IT IS!

05:36.186 --> 05:38.318
IT'S HEADING
FOR MOUNT RUSHMORE.

05:38.386 --> 05:41.017
SO, THAT'S THEIR PLAN, HUH?

05:41.085 --> 05:42.750
THEY WANT TO PUT
KRANG'S FACE UP THERE

05:42.818 --> 05:45.284
AND SCARE THE COUNTRY
INTO SUBMISSION.

05:45.351 --> 05:47.150
WE'LL HAVE TO
GET AHEAD OF IT.

05:51.050 --> 05:54.814
LOOK! THEY AREN'T
GOING TO MOUNT RUSHMORE.

05:54.816 --> 05:56.048
THEY'RE AFTER THAT!

05:56.116 --> 05:57.381
WHAT IS IT?

05:57.449 --> 05:59.781
IT'S THE RUSHMORE
POWER ANTENNA.

05:59.848 --> 06:02.513
IT CAN DRAW ELECTRICITY
FROM ANYWHERE ON EARTH,

06:02.581 --> 06:04.312
WITHOUT THE USE OF WIRES.

06:04.380 --> 06:07.545
WHAT DO KRANG
AND SHREDDER WANT
WITH THAT MUCH POWER?

06:07.613 --> 06:09.946
A QUARTER SAYS IT'S NOT
TO ROAST MARSHMALLOWS.

06:14.946 --> 06:16.944
NO, NO. TURN BACK.

06:17.045 --> 06:18.776
IT'S HEADING THIS WAY.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.410
BUT WE'VE GOT TO
GET IN THERE.

06:20.478 --> 06:21.776
ARE YOU CRAZY?

06:21.843 --> 06:24.042
IT'LL CRUSH
THIS PLACE FLAT.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.409
4 GIANT TURTLES
AND ONE GIANT RAT

06:28.377 --> 06:30.441
DRIVING AN R.V.?

06:30.509 --> 06:33.141
I GUESS I'M THE ONE
WHO'S CRAZY.

06:33.209 --> 06:35.340
THAT WAY--
TO THE POWER TURBINES!

06:37.475 --> 06:39.873
SO, LIKE,
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

06:39.941 --> 06:41.107
I HAVE A PLAN.

06:41.141 --> 06:43.106
OH, YEAH?
WELL, YOU'VE GOT ABOUT 10--

06:43.173 --> 06:45.273
9 SECONDS
TO PULL IT OFF.

06:49.406 --> 06:52.838
IT'S TURNING INTO
A DADDY-LONGLEGS DROME.

06:55.738 --> 06:58.336
HERE IT COMES!

06:58.404 --> 07:01.535
DUDES, I THINK IT'S TIME
WE MAKE TURTLE TRACKS!

07:01.637 --> 07:03.736
GOOD IDEA,
BUT WHERE?

07:03.803 --> 07:05.235
WELL, I HEAR THE CARIBBEAN

07:05.302 --> 07:06.735
IS PRETTY NICE
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

07:08.002 --> 07:09.435
WHAT A WAY TO GO!

07:17.968 --> 07:19.299
PRETTY IRONIC, HUH?

07:19.400 --> 07:21.731
FOR THIS I BROKE
A DENTAL APPOINTMENT.

07:21.800 --> 07:22.899
LOOK OUT!

07:25.199 --> 07:26.931
THEY'RE STEALING
THE POWER ANTENNA!

07:26.999 --> 07:28.964
<i>THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK.
COME ON!</i>

07:30.431 --> 07:31.863
OH, OH, I GET IT.

07:31.931 --> 07:33.463
YOU'LL PUT ON THAT
SILLY-LOOKING SUIT

07:33.531 --> 07:34.863
AND EMBARRASS
THEM AWAY.

07:34.931 --> 07:37.229
WRONG. I'M GOING
TO PLUG THIS CABLE

07:37.296 --> 07:38.862
INTO THE MAIN GENERATOR

07:38.930 --> 07:40.395
AND GIVE
SHREDDER AND KRANG

07:40.462 --> 07:42.328
THE BIGGEST HOTFOOT
IN HISTORY.

07:52.460 --> 07:55.292
NOW! PLUG IN
THOSE POWER CABLES!

07:55.359 --> 07:58.892
HURRY, YOU KLUTZES!

07:58.959 --> 08:03.591
DON'T YOU KNOW
EXCELLENCE CANNOT
BE RUSHED?

08:03.659 --> 08:07.456
MAIN POWER OUTPUT--
JUST WHAT WE NEED.

08:07.558 --> 08:09.223
STAND CLEAR, EVERYONE.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.189
I'M GOING TO ZAP
THE TECHNODROME CIRCUITS

08:11.291 --> 08:14.322
FROM HERE TO HELSINKI.

08:14.390 --> 08:17.421
NOW, TO DRAW IN
ALL THE ENERGY

08:17.489 --> 08:20.388
OF THIS ENTIRE
WRETCHED PLANET!

08:21.488 --> 08:25.786
LITTLE DAVID IS ABOUT
TO BRING DOWN GOLIATH.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.553
THE CURRENT'S
SHUT OFF.

08:28.621 --> 08:31.519
BOY, WHAT A WASTE
OF A HEROIC LINE.

08:33.285 --> 08:34.719
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:34.787 --> 08:35.952
WE'RE TOO LATE.

08:35.986 --> 08:37.485
THEY'RE ALREADY
DRAWING IN POWER.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.217
WITH THE
ENERGY ANTENNA.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.217
WITH THAT ANTENNA,

08:40.284 --> 08:42.451
THEY'LL SUCK THE EARTH
COMPLETELY DRY

08:42.518 --> 08:43.850
OF ALL ENERGY.

08:43.918 --> 08:45.783
IT IS VITAL
THAT WE STOP THEM,

08:45.851 --> 08:47.283
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.449
QUICKLY, THIS WAY,
MY STUDENTS.

08:55.116 --> 08:58.947
WE MUST SHUT DOWN
THAT POWER ANTENNA.

08:58.949 --> 09:01.346
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

09:01.448 --> 09:02.780
THOSE WRETCHED SHELLBACKS--

09:02.847 --> 09:05.112
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE!

09:05.181 --> 09:07.512
AND SPLINTER
IS WITH THEM.

09:07.580 --> 09:11.078
I'LL DESTROY HIM
WITH MY BARE HANDS

09:11.146 --> 09:13.478
AND CRUSH THOSE TURTLES
INTO PULP!

09:13.545 --> 09:16.278
I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME
FOR THIS.

09:16.345 --> 09:17.644
NO, SHREDDER.

09:17.712 --> 09:19.210
I NEED YOU WITH ME

09:19.278 --> 09:21.342
TO GUIDE
THE TECHNODROME.

09:21.411 --> 09:23.943
BUT I WANT TO DESTROY
THE TURTLES!

09:23.977 --> 09:25.410
NOT NOW.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.809
WE STILL HAVE
A WORLD TO CONQUER.

09:27.877 --> 09:31.141
I'LL DISPENSE
WITH THEM FROM HERE.

09:33.274 --> 09:35.040
IF I DON'T
GET TO SMASH SOMETHING

09:35.008 --> 09:37.040
I'LL GO CRAZY!

09:37.108 --> 09:38.573
KEEP CLIMBING,
TURTLES.

09:38.641 --> 09:41.273
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

09:41.341 --> 09:44.239
NOW I KNOW HOW
KING KONG MUST HAVE FELT.

09:46.406 --> 09:49.105
LOOK OUT!
AN EYEBALL MISSILE!

09:49.172 --> 09:50.871
THEY WOULDN'T
DARE FIRE AT US.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.904
THEY'D BLOW
HALF THE HULL OFF.

09:52.972 --> 09:56.671
RIGHT. THEY'RE GOING
TO BLAST MOUNT RUSHMORE!

09:56.738 --> 10:00.836
WHY, THOSE
UNPATRIOTIC CHEESEBALLS!

10:00.904 --> 10:02.569
WE'VE GOTTA STOP 'EM.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.335
QUICK, GET THE MISSILE
OFF THE LAUNCHER!

10:08.901 --> 10:09.901
HELP!

10:12.101 --> 10:14.667
OUR WEIGHT SHOULD
THROW IT OFF COURSE.

10:14.734 --> 10:16.000
IT'S WORKING!

10:20.833 --> 10:22.898
DO THOSE GUYS REMIND YOU
OF SOMEONE?

10:24.165 --> 10:25.364
WE DID IT!

10:25.431 --> 10:27.363
WE SAVED
THE MONUMENT!

10:27.431 --> 10:29.697
NOW WE'D BETTER
SAVE OURSELVES.

10:31.132 --> 10:32.930
JUMP FOR IT!

10:39.630 --> 10:41.195
I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

10:41.263 --> 10:42.727
WE MADE IT!

10:42.795 --> 10:46.060
AS THE MONSTROUS MACHINE
APPROACHES THE CITY,

10:46.128 --> 10:48.227
A MYSTERIOUS FORCE
IS DRAWING

10:48.295 --> 10:49.993
ALL ELECTRICAL ENERGY

10:50.061 --> 10:51.659
FROM THE CITY'S
POWER SOURCES.

10:51.727 --> 10:53.926
THOUSANDS ARE FLEEING THE CITY.

10:53.994 --> 10:56.758
APRIL,
WHERE IN BLAZES
HAVE YOU BEEN?

10:56.826 --> 10:58.792
I'VE BEEN
GETTING YOUR STORY.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.325
AMONG THE MISSING

11:00.392 --> 11:03.124
IS OUR OWN
SECOND-STRING REPORTER

11:03.192 --> 11:04.557
APRIL O'NEILL...

11:04.624 --> 11:07.124
SECOND-STRING REPORTER?

11:07.225 --> 11:10.956
WHO IS PROBABLY COWERING
IN SOME AIR RAID SHELTER.

11:12.257 --> 11:14.556
THIS IS APRIL O'NEILL.

11:14.623 --> 11:17.421
THIS HUMONGOUS SPHERE
IS THE ONE THAT'S STEALING

11:17.489 --> 11:19.754
OUR ELECTRICAL ENERGY.

11:25.754 --> 11:29.086
THE TECHNODROME'S
HEADED BACK TOWARD THE CITY.

11:29.153 --> 11:30.919
WE'VE GOT TO
STOP IT.

11:31.021 --> 11:32.252
YOU KNOW, DUDES,

11:32.320 --> 11:34.085
I HAVE
THIS FUNNY FEELING

11:34.153 --> 11:35.751
THAT WE'RE MISSING
SOMETHING.

11:35.819 --> 11:38.517
WHAT, DID YOU LOSE YOUR KEYS
WHILE WE WERE RIDING
THAT MISSILE?

11:38.585 --> 11:40.684
OH, NO.
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

11:40.751 --> 11:43.516
YEAH. I THINK ALL THIS STRESS
IS REALLY GETTING TO YOU.

11:43.585 --> 11:45.016
NO, I AGREE.

11:45.084 --> 11:46.916
<i>IT FEELS LIKE
SOMETHING IS MISSING.</i>

11:46.984 --> 11:49.416
HEY, WE GOT OUR
WEAPONS, OUR GEAR.

11:49.483 --> 11:50.648
WHAT COULD BE MISSING?

11:50.716 --> 11:53.748
YEAH. REMEMBER
WHAT SPLINTER SAID...

11:53.816 --> 11:55.581
SPLINTER!
SPLINTER!

11:55.648 --> 11:57.681
HE'S STILL WITH
THE TECHNODROME!

11:57.749 --> 11:59.947
MICHELANGELO,
BURN RUBBER!

12:06.747 --> 12:08.012
I MUST FIND A WAY

12:08.080 --> 12:10.044
TO SHUT DOWN
THAT POWER ANTENNA.

12:10.112 --> 12:12.811
I ONLY HOPE THE TURTLES
ARE ALL RIGHT.

12:14.012 --> 12:15.477
THERE IT IS!

12:16.711 --> 12:19.977
IT'S HEADED FOR
THE WORLD TRADE BUILDING.

12:29.309 --> 12:33.907
NOW TO PUT ALL THIS ENERGY
TO A BAD USE!

12:36.641 --> 12:40.073
PREPARE TO OPEN
THE DIMENSIONAL PORTAL.

12:49.039 --> 12:50.271
LOOK!

12:52.939 --> 12:55.836
KRANG'S USING THE CITY'S
TALLEST SKYSCRAPER

12:55.905 --> 12:58.669
AS A GIANT
ENERGY TRANSMITTER.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.702
HE'S CREATED
A SUPER-SIZE

13:00.770 --> 13:02.136
DIMENSIONAL PORTAL.

13:02.204 --> 13:05.501
THAT LOOKS LIKE
DIMENSION X!

13:05.569 --> 13:08.167
AND WE'RE HEADED RIGHT
FOR THE PORTAL.

13:08.234 --> 13:12.000
THE EARTH IS
ON ITS WAY
TO DIMENSION X!

13:16.667 --> 13:19.998
THE EARTH IS HEADED
FOR THAT DIMENSIONAL PORTAL!

13:20.066 --> 13:22.731
THE WHOLE PLANET'S
ON A ONE-WAY TRIP

13:22.799 --> 13:24.264
TO DIMENSION X!

13:24.332 --> 13:26.064
WE'VE GOT TO
STOP THIS.

13:26.132 --> 13:27.764
EITHER THAT
OR LOOK FOR A BOOK TITLED

13:27.831 --> 13:29.864
<i>DIMENSION X
ON A DOLLAR A DAY.</i>

13:38.063 --> 13:38.795
FIRE!

13:45.962 --> 13:47.160
CEASE FIRING.

13:47.228 --> 13:50.359
THEY'VE GOT SOME KIND OF
PROTECTIVE FORCE FIELD.

13:50.427 --> 13:52.760
OUR SHELLS JUST
BOUNCE OFF IT.

13:52.827 --> 13:56.926
GENTLEMEN, I'M AFRAID
THE EARTH IS DOOMED.

14:00.326 --> 14:01.825
DONATELLO,
I HOPE YOU HAVE

14:01.892 --> 14:03.923
SOME INCREDIBLY BRILLIANT
LAST-MINUTE PLAN

14:03.991 --> 14:05.257
TO SAVE THE UNIVERSE.

14:05.325 --> 14:07.289
WHY IS IT
ALWAYS ME?

14:07.358 --> 14:10.122
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE BRAINIAC
OF THIS OUTFIT.

14:10.191 --> 14:12.023
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:12.090 --> 14:13.023
COME TO THINK OF IT,

14:13.089 --> 14:15.322
THAT THING DOES
GIVE ME AN IDEA.

14:15.390 --> 14:17.388
I KNOW HOW
TO GET RID
OF THE TECHNODROME

14:17.456 --> 14:18.721
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

14:18.789 --> 14:20.987
MICHELANGELO,
YOU AND LEONARDO

14:21.055 --> 14:22.288
GET INTO
THE TECHNODROME

14:22.355 --> 14:23.720
AND RESCUE
MASTER SPLINTER.

14:23.788 --> 14:25.387
RAPHAEL, YOU AND I

14:25.455 --> 14:27.186
ARE GOING TO BUY
SOME ARMY SURPLUS.

14:27.254 --> 14:29.586
I HOPE THEY TAKE
AMPHIBIAN EXPRESS.

14:29.653 --> 14:31.785
WE'LL HAVE TO GET
UNDER THE TECHNODROME

14:31.920 --> 14:33.818
TO GET PAST
THE FORCE FIELD.

14:33.886 --> 14:35.884
HEY, DUDE,
NO PROBLEMO.

14:35.952 --> 14:38.318
SO, SPLINTER,

14:38.385 --> 14:40.384
YOU CAME TO SHUT DOWN
THE PORTAL, HUH?

14:40.452 --> 14:42.384
WELL, YOU'RE TOO LATE.

14:42.452 --> 14:43.883
IT'S ON AUTOMATIC.

14:43.951 --> 14:47.982
THE PORTAL WILL REMAIN OPEN
UNTIL WE PASS THROUGH IT.

14:48.050 --> 14:51.382
TODAY WE'LL SEE
MY ULTIMATE TRIUMPH.

14:51.450 --> 14:53.881
THE EARTH
WILL BE CONQUERED,

14:53.949 --> 14:56.848
AND YOU WILL PERISH
BY MY OWN HAND!

14:59.714 --> 15:02.379
ARE YOU SURE
WE'RE UNDER
THE TECHNODROME?

15:02.447 --> 15:04.712
SURE I'M SURE!
COME ON.

15:07.913 --> 15:10.844
BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA
FIND A WAY INSIDE?

15:12.245 --> 15:13.478
THAT HATCH
MARKED "ENTRANCE"

15:13.546 --> 15:15.010
MIGHT BE A GOOD
PLACE TO START.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.909
GENERAL,
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

15:21.977 --> 15:24.042
WHO IN BLAZES
ARE YOU?

15:24.110 --> 15:26.242
DON'T YOU WATCH TV?

15:26.277 --> 15:27.808
WE CAN STOP THIS MENACE,

15:27.876 --> 15:29.874
BUT WE NEED
ONE OF YOUR WEAPONS.

15:29.976 --> 15:32.341
THOSE WEAPONS ARE
FOR ARMY USE ONLY.

15:32.408 --> 15:34.808
BESIDES, YOU'RE...
TURTLES.

15:34.874 --> 15:36.273
EVACUATE THE AREA,

15:36.342 --> 15:37.606
<i>AND I MEAN NOW!</i>

15:37.674 --> 15:38.773
ALL RIGHT,
HEY, HEY,

15:38.841 --> 15:40.606
DON'T GET
YOUR METALS
IN A BUNCH.

15:42.607 --> 15:45.938
RAPHAEL, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO BORROW
THAT MISSILE LAUNCHER.

15:47.473 --> 15:49.471
BUT YOU SAID
WE'D NEED ARMY SURPLUS.

15:49.539 --> 15:50.805
THAT'S BRAND-NEW.

15:50.872 --> 15:53.804
WELL, IT'LL BE SURPLUS
WHEN WE'RE THROUGH WITH IT.

15:53.872 --> 15:57.935
OH, I'M GETTING
CALLUSES FROM OPENING
ALL THESE DOORS.

15:58.003 --> 15:59.635
WE'VE GOT TO
KEEP SEARCHING.

16:04.169 --> 16:07.000
BEBOP!
ROCKSTEADY!

16:07.068 --> 16:09.767
IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

16:09.834 --> 16:12.033
YEAH.
WE'RE GETTING EVEN

16:12.100 --> 16:14.966
FOR ALL THEM TIMES
YOU CREAMED US.

16:15.034 --> 16:18.533
RIGHT. I REMEMBER
THE TIME IN THAT
PAINT FACTORY

16:18.600 --> 16:20.799
WE GOT
YOU DUDES GOOD.

16:20.833 --> 16:23.498
OH, YEAH?
WHAT'D YOU DO?

16:23.566 --> 16:25.131
WE DID THIS.

16:28.632 --> 16:32.496
I REMEMBER THAT.

16:32.564 --> 16:36.495
YEAH, AND MY PERSONAL
FAVORITE TIME WITH YOU GUYS

16:36.563 --> 16:38.796
WAS AT THAT AMUSEMENT PARK,

16:38.863 --> 16:40.395
WHEN I DID THIS.

16:41.862 --> 16:46.061
OH, YEAH. IT'S ALL
COMING BACK TO ME.

16:46.162 --> 16:49.460
BOY, THANKS
FOR THE MEMORY.

16:49.495 --> 16:52.592
<i>SO LONG, COMPADRES.
GOTTA SPLIT.</i>

16:52.660 --> 16:56.325
UH, I THINK
ON OUR STROLL
DOWN MEMORY LANE,

16:56.393 --> 16:58.625
WE STEPPED
IN A POTHOLE.

16:58.693 --> 17:01.625
I HAVE ENJOYED
TOYING WITH YOU,

17:01.692 --> 17:03.657
YOU WRETCHED RODENT!

17:03.724 --> 17:07.089
BUT NOW IT'S TIME
TO FINISH YOU.

17:08.191 --> 17:10.823
IT IS YOU WHO ARE
FINISHED, SHREDDER.

17:15.189 --> 17:17.721
WHAT?! MY SWORD?!

17:24.288 --> 17:25.953
MOVE IT, RAPHAEL.

17:26.020 --> 17:27.852
THOSE TURTLES ARE
STEALING THE LAUNCHER!

17:27.920 --> 17:29.153
STOP THEM!

17:29.220 --> 17:31.019
TAKE THE CANNON.
I'LL DRIVE.

17:31.087 --> 17:32.351
WE'RE GONNA
NEED AN EXIT.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.118
ONE EXIT
COMING UP!

17:38.885 --> 17:41.483
BLAST IT!
WE LOST THEM.

17:41.585 --> 17:43.116
SHOULD WE
GO AFTER THEM,
GENERAL?

17:43.184 --> 17:45.149
NO! I REFUSE
TO REPORT

17:45.217 --> 17:48.115
THAT MY MEN
ARE CHASING 2 TURTLES
THROUGH A SEWER.

17:48.150 --> 17:51.315
GENERAL DRAG,
IS YOUR FLEET READY?

17:51.383 --> 17:53.748
WE ARE READY,
LORD KRANG.

17:53.815 --> 17:56.215
THE ENTIRE ARMADA
OF STARFIGHTERS

17:56.282 --> 17:57.647
IS READY
TO ATTACK EARTH

17:57.715 --> 17:59.747
THE MOMENT IT COMES
THROUGH THE PORTAL.

17:59.815 --> 18:03.646
THIS GAME HAS GONE ON
LONG ENOUGH.

18:08.480 --> 18:12.211
NOW, RODENT,
MEET YOUR DOOM!

18:14.479 --> 18:16.110
AS THE NEW RULER ON EARTH,

18:16.178 --> 18:21.009
THIS WILL BE MY FIRST
ROYAL EXTERMINATION!

18:21.077 --> 18:24.575
HOW ABOUT A ROYAL FLUSH,
TIN GRIN?

18:30.742 --> 18:33.107
WE MUST HURRY,
MASTER SPLINTER.

18:33.175 --> 18:36.006
WE CANNOT LEAVE THIS PLACE
TOO SOON FOR ME.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.739
OH, THOSE ACCURSED TURTLES!

18:41.807 --> 18:43.639
I'LL MAKE THEM
PAY FOR THIS,

18:43.706 --> 18:46.172
ALONG WITH THE BILL
FOR MY DRY CLEANING.

18:47.539 --> 18:49.237
I JUST HOPE
DONATELLO'S HAD TIME

18:49.305 --> 18:50.771
TO WORK UP HIS PLAN.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.237
REMEMBER WHAT
I SAID, MY STUDENTS.

18:53.305 --> 18:54.669
SHREDDER'S OWN EVIL

18:54.737 --> 18:57.236
HAS ALREADY
DOOMED HIM TO FAIL.

18:59.604 --> 19:01.535
GIVE ME THOSE CONTROLS.

19:01.603 --> 19:04.602
MY, BUT AREN'T WE
GETTING PUSHY.

19:04.669 --> 19:06.935
THE TURTLES AND SPLINTER
ARE GETTING AWAY!

19:07.002 --> 19:09.267
I MUST DESTROY THEM.

19:09.334 --> 19:11.400
DON'T WASTE
YOUR TIME.

19:11.468 --> 19:13.266
IN 5 MORE
MINUTES,

19:13.334 --> 19:16.999
THIS PLANET
WILL BE ENTERING
DIMENSION X.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.532
MY SPACE FLEET
CAN BLAST

19:19.600 --> 19:22.431
THIS ENTIRE CITY
TO ATOMS.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.832
<i>I MUST DESTROY THEM!</i>

19:24.899 --> 19:27.264
THEY MUST PAY
FOR HUMILIATING ME.

19:27.332 --> 19:31.196
SHREDDER, YOU'RE
PACKING AN ATTITUDE.

19:31.264 --> 19:32.530
WE MUST HURRY.

19:34.530 --> 19:35.962
SHREDDER HAS SPOTTED US.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.295
RUN!

19:37.363 --> 19:39.495
I'M BOOGIE-ING, BUD!

19:40.562 --> 19:42.227
WHOA, HOLD IT, DONATELLO!

19:42.295 --> 19:44.393
WE CAN'T BLAST
THOSE WATER PIPES.

19:44.461 --> 19:46.126
WE'LL BE SWEPT OUT
INTO THE RIVER.

19:46.194 --> 19:47.594
ARE WE
UNDER THE TECHNODROME?

19:47.661 --> 19:49.659
NO, BUT WE'RE CLOSE.

19:52.893 --> 19:55.925
HEY, GUYS, ANY CHANCE
YOU COULD GET
THE TECHNODROME

19:55.993 --> 19:57.591
TO FOLLOW YOU
TO TIMES SQUARE?

19:57.659 --> 19:59.958
I'D SAY THERE'S
A FAIRLY GOOD CHANCE!

20:00.026 --> 20:01.557
OK, RAPHAEL,

20:01.625 --> 20:03.890
PREPARE THE BIRD
FOR FLIGHT.

20:03.958 --> 20:05.390
ROGER, WILCO.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.389
I LOVE
THAT MILITARY LINGO.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.522
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
MY STUDENTS,

20:10.590 --> 20:12.655
DO NOT MOVE
UNTIL I SAY SO.

20:12.723 --> 20:15.189
FAREWELL, ACCURSED ENEMY.

20:16.656 --> 20:19.287
REMEMBER, STAND YOUR GROUND.

20:19.355 --> 20:20.887
NOW!

20:20.988 --> 20:21.653
NOW!

20:21.788 --> 20:22.653
NOW!

20:25.187 --> 20:27.019
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

20:27.087 --> 20:29.752
WE'RE BEING CARRIED OFF
BY A MISSILE!

20:29.820 --> 20:32.618
SHREDDER,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

20:35.185 --> 20:38.383
IT'S COMING THROUGH.
OPEN FIRE!

20:39.351 --> 20:42.550
STOP, YOU FOOLS.
IT'S US!

20:42.616 --> 20:44.516
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

20:48.983 --> 20:51.914
NO TECHNODROME,
NO PORTAL,

20:51.982 --> 20:53.381
NO NOTHING!

20:53.449 --> 20:54.914
AND WORST OF ALL,

20:54.982 --> 20:58.713
WE'RE STUCK HERE
IN DIMENSION X!

20:58.781 --> 20:59.913
IT COULD BE WORSE.

20:59.981 --> 21:02.379
WE MIGHT HAVE WOUND UP
IN DIMENSION Z.

21:02.447 --> 21:03.745
COME HERE.

21:10.446 --> 21:12.578
WELL, THIS TIME
I REALLY THINK

21:12.645 --> 21:14.910
WE'VE SEEN THE LAST
OF OLD SHRED-HEAD.

21:14.978 --> 21:16.744
YOU WERE RIGHT,
MASTER.

21:16.811 --> 21:19.610
HIS EVIL REALLY WAS
HIS OWN UNDOING.

21:19.677 --> 21:23.141
AND YOUR VIRTUE
ENABLED YOU TO DEFEAT HIM.

21:23.209 --> 21:25.942
THAT'S RIGHT!
AND WE MUSTN'T BE
ANY LESS VIGILANT

21:26.010 --> 21:27.742
JUST BECAUSE HE'S GONE.

21:27.809 --> 21:28.674
YOU SAID IT.

21:28.742 --> 21:30.974
WE NINJAS
ARE ALWAYS ON THE JOB.

21:31.042 --> 21:34.340
OF COURSE, EVEN NINJAS
DESERVE A REWARD
NOW AND THEN.

21:34.442 --> 21:36.173
RIGHTEOUS
NOTION, DUDE.

21:38.141 --> 21:42.771
I THINK I'LL HAVE MY REWARD
SMOTHERED WITH PEPPERONI

21:42.840 --> 21:44.405
AND HOT FUDGE.
