WEBVTT

00:01.195 --> 00:02.640
Previously on "Quantico"...

00:02.695 --> 00:05.484
The AIC is the hand
of a much larger body.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.796
I'm forming a select team to fight it.

00:07.805 --> 00:09.204
A covert joint-task force.

00:09.239 --> 00:11.841
Roarke is the man in the
government that we've been looking for.

00:11.876 --> 00:13.308
That's the Speaker of the House.

00:13.344 --> 00:14.543
Why'd you leave Russia?

00:14.579 --> 00:17.244
This isn't first-date material.

00:17.347 --> 00:18.695
We're just worried about you.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.048
Yeah, well, you should be
worried about me getting killed.

00:21.084 --> 00:22.632
Raina still hasn't spoken to me,

00:22.657 --> 00:24.827
and I don't know if she ever will.

00:25.889 --> 00:27.856
I don't want to die for this. I'm sorry.

00:27.929 --> 00:29.123
Goodbye, Harry.

00:52.418 --> 00:53.887
_

01:19.272 --> 01:20.539
You okay?

01:20.604 --> 01:22.862
Need a minute?

01:22.976 --> 01:24.760
You want some water?

01:24.877 --> 01:27.051
I missed you, too, Felix.

01:27.146 --> 01:29.246
You're also missing a lot of shots.

01:29.332 --> 01:31.181
I guess you only knew
your way around a court

01:31.216 --> 01:33.183
when you used it to hook up.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.207
It was boarding school.

01:35.287 --> 01:37.287
You were there... Squash courts
were the only place

01:37.322 --> 01:39.356
to take girls on campus
without people finding you.

01:39.462 --> 01:41.485
I hope you were better at that
than you are at this.

01:41.509 --> 01:43.092
Serve.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.846
How is the Iron Mommy?

01:48.934 --> 01:50.299
The President is good.

01:50.369 --> 01:52.314
And the Sith Lord?

01:52.403 --> 01:55.204
The Speaker of the House
is happy, rested,

01:55.239 --> 01:56.606
and ready for a big day.

01:56.672 --> 01:59.656
I'd heard Roarke was bringing the
Muslim registry back to a vote.

01:59.681 --> 02:01.634
I mean, I get it.

02:01.696 --> 02:04.664
It's gone down twice.
Why not make it a TKO?

02:04.734 --> 02:06.214
We need to keep your country safe.

02:06.281 --> 02:09.751
Henry believes extraordinary times
call for extraordinary measures.

02:09.835 --> 02:12.320
- And what do you believe?
- Whatever he does.

02:12.390 --> 02:13.421
He's the boss.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.015
You're a senior legislative
assistant to the Speaker.

02:16.078 --> 02:17.836
That's a very big deal.

02:17.953 --> 02:19.027
You've been there for a year.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.773
You have to know
who your boss really is by now.

02:20.797 --> 02:22.763
You really want to hitch
your wagon to that horse?

02:22.799 --> 02:24.565
You won't be happy till I'm a Democrat.

02:24.601 --> 02:25.800
You used to be one.

02:26.435 --> 02:28.069
I'm just looking out for you.

02:28.172 --> 02:30.437
Well, you should be looking out
for yourself.

02:30.516 --> 02:33.711
I heard everything
about your new co-worker.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.475
Maxine talked about Shelby?

02:35.558 --> 02:37.276
Better me than a mediator.

02:39.615 --> 02:42.248
I can't believe we're
going back into the real world.

02:42.316 --> 02:44.566
I just wish we didn't have to.

02:44.653 --> 02:47.874
But after what happened
in New York, we can't expect

02:47.945 --> 02:49.989
the Collaborators will hit
the cache anytime soon,

02:50.070 --> 02:51.857
so we have to go back
to our cover lives.

02:51.892 --> 02:53.291
Adios, muchachas.

02:53.327 --> 02:55.979
Ooh. Shelby, do you still have
those ski gloves?

02:56.063 --> 02:58.130
- Have fun freezing your butt off.
- Thank you.

02:58.182 --> 03:01.266
Ski gloves? Since when do you ski?

03:01.346 --> 03:03.301
I don't know. Since high school.

03:03.377 --> 03:05.703
This is a prank. Is this a prank?

03:05.739 --> 03:08.272
'Cause he doesn't ski. You don't ski.

03:08.357 --> 03:10.341
Well, I guess you never really
know someone, do you?

03:10.365 --> 03:12.443
And who's gonna wear
these dainty little things?

03:12.514 --> 03:14.045
I'm pretty sure it's not you.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.101
An asset I'm developing...
a reporter from the Journal.

03:17.187 --> 03:18.716
The one who exposed Sean Gregory?

03:18.804 --> 03:21.585
Well, someone's got to find out
how that happened.

03:21.721 --> 03:24.382
See you next time the world explodes.

03:24.489 --> 03:26.229
Since when does Ryan ski?

03:26.659 --> 03:29.901
Um, your ex-fiancÃ©
is most likely dating someone

03:29.948 --> 03:32.395
for the first time since you...
a likely asset...

03:32.430 --> 03:34.031
and that is your headline?

03:34.066 --> 03:35.710
I just thought I knew everything
about him.

03:35.734 --> 03:37.776
Oh, you can never know
everything about anybody.

03:37.886 --> 03:41.331
We just learn what we learn
as we learn it.

03:41.405 --> 03:43.230
There's always more.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.595
Yeah, I could definitely use
a break from this fishbowl.

03:46.658 --> 03:47.923
It does things to your head.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.478
You know, it's... it's not the bowl.

03:49.513 --> 03:50.479
It's the fish.

03:50.514 --> 03:52.456
I will be away from him, too.

03:52.550 --> 03:55.471
You stay at summer camp too long,
you end up regretting something.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.186
Now all I need is a 90-minute massage

03:58.221 --> 04:00.147
and six hours at the gun range,

04:00.172 --> 04:01.797
and I will be back to the real me.

04:01.858 --> 04:03.178
Call me when you get to New York.

04:03.235 --> 04:04.719
Will do.

04:11.068 --> 04:13.910
Wow. You should really have
a plaque on this booth.

04:14.036 --> 04:17.699
Same breakfast every day,
same place, same time.

04:17.807 --> 04:19.125
Are you saying I'm boring?

04:19.208 --> 04:21.529
I would never do that.
I just think you're predictable.

04:22.578 --> 04:23.677
What are you doing here?

04:23.742 --> 04:26.766
Well, Nimah asked me to meet
her, but she's not here yet.

04:26.828 --> 04:28.548
Well, have a seat.

04:28.650 --> 04:30.391
Right. Thanks.

04:31.419 --> 04:34.212
So, how was your visit?

04:34.321 --> 04:36.540
Well, we talked...

04:37.092 --> 04:37.990
technically.

04:38.026 --> 04:40.316
I-I wouldn't say we used full sentences.

04:40.428 --> 04:42.561
Lydia didn't have a lot to say, huh?

04:42.663 --> 04:43.963
No.

04:44.070 --> 04:46.827
I'm the one who didn't have
anything to say.

04:47.001 --> 04:49.382
I can't ask her
what I really need to know.

04:49.538 --> 04:51.171
Was it my fault?

04:51.271 --> 04:53.524
Did I make her into this person?
Did she just make a mistake?

04:53.548 --> 04:55.440
Is this who she really is?

04:57.243 --> 04:59.711
Anyway, you must be excited.

04:59.852 --> 05:02.211
You all get to go back to your lives.

05:02.315 --> 05:04.038
You've got your fancy
New York apartment.

05:05.118 --> 05:06.679
Shelby has her D.C. townhouse.

05:06.704 --> 05:10.094
Harry has... whatever it is
he ran away to.

05:10.189 --> 05:12.515
But me? This is my life.

05:13.659 --> 05:16.492
No friends, fractured family.

05:17.670 --> 05:21.105
Hey, look, I could, um...
I could stay for a while.

05:23.368 --> 05:25.769
Thanks, but I'll see you
when you get back.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.303
Okay, sure.

05:27.383 --> 05:29.108
Wow. Rebuffed again.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.473
I told you you were predictable.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.401
Alex... go home.

05:33.595 --> 05:35.681
At least you still can.

05:43.553 --> 05:45.279
Nimah?

05:46.995 --> 05:49.816
What are you doing here?
Didn't you see me walk in?

05:49.894 --> 05:51.761
Is he gone?

05:51.902 --> 05:52.919
Owen?

05:52.963 --> 05:54.129
Yeah.

05:58.467 --> 05:59.867
Give me a second, okay?

06:03.493 --> 06:04.616
Hello?

06:04.641 --> 06:06.473
I went to see Raina. She isn't here.

06:06.509 --> 06:09.029
Her apartment is full
of anti-American propaganda,

06:09.054 --> 06:11.514
blueprints for a shopping
center, bomb components.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.880
It looks exactly like
yours did last year.

06:13.943 --> 06:15.654
I-I don't know where she is.

06:15.725 --> 06:18.460
I do, and she's safe.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.773
Let me call you right back, okay?

06:26.394 --> 06:28.742
Your sister's really worried
about you... Raina.

06:33.301 --> 06:35.534
I've never done something
like this before.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.102
What, ski? Oh, it's easy.

06:37.127 --> 06:38.838
It's expensive, but it's easy.

06:38.910 --> 06:41.540
No. Going away with a man I've
only had a half a date with.

06:41.621 --> 06:44.517
Locked away for the whole
weekend with no distractions,

06:44.552 --> 06:47.149
it means that we'll get to know
the real us faster.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.064
Ah.

06:48.089 --> 06:51.916
And we'll spend a whole ton
of money getting cold, wet,

06:51.952 --> 06:54.801
and bruised up in the process.
Sound good?

06:54.965 --> 06:56.133
Sure.

07:00.544 --> 07:02.982
_

07:11.837 --> 07:12.970
Let's do it again soon.

07:13.073 --> 07:14.304
Definitely.

07:14.393 --> 07:17.374
Have fun cleaning President Mom's boots.

07:17.456 --> 07:19.309
Say "hi" to Voldemort for me.

07:28.137 --> 07:29.185
What's going on?

07:30.755 --> 07:33.055
Are you in trouble?
What happened to your hijab?

07:33.091 --> 07:34.723
I was attacked.

07:34.810 --> 07:39.327
A man and a woman... they put
things in my apartment, Alex.

07:39.420 --> 07:40.896
I think they're trying to frame me.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.364
We interrupt with breaking news.

07:42.436 --> 07:44.708
Details are just
emerging from what appears to be

07:44.733 --> 07:48.642
a deadly terror attack on
American soil in Dayton, Ohio,

07:48.667 --> 07:50.405
this morning, where a bomber struck

07:50.440 --> 07:52.407
the Gallow Green Shopping Center.

07:52.449 --> 07:55.307
- Wait... wait here.
- At least 15 are dead and dozens wounded.

07:55.417 --> 07:58.745
The Islamic Front has claimed
credit for the Dayton attack.

07:58.770 --> 07:59.852
Authorities believe

07:59.877 --> 08:02.562
they are close to identifying
the actual bomber,

08:02.587 --> 08:05.538
who is described as a female
wearing a hijab.

08:05.687 --> 08:09.929
They are moving to identify her based
on CCTV footage from the scene.

08:10.059 --> 08:11.186
Looks like it's time to get
you out of here.

08:11.210 --> 08:12.803
- This attack comes after a long period
- Come on.

08:12.827 --> 08:16.529
of a national soul-searching
in the wake of the G20 crisis.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.532
- Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.
- What is the nature of terror in America?

08:19.567 --> 08:22.369
What and who should we fear and why?

08:22.432 --> 08:26.338
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

08:26.829 --> 08:28.236
This attack could not have come

08:28.244 --> 08:30.150
at a worse time for President Haas,

08:30.244 --> 08:32.953
whose once-sterling
national-security credentials

08:33.017 --> 08:34.134
have come under attack

08:34.159 --> 08:36.025
- from a more confident GOP.
- I don't get it.

08:36.392 --> 08:38.306
Everything the Collaborators
have done so far

08:38.361 --> 08:40.892
has been under the radar,
so why a shopping mall?

08:40.971 --> 08:42.638
How does this fit in to their endgame?

08:42.664 --> 08:44.566
Could just be a terrorist attack.

08:44.628 --> 08:46.660
- And we don't know it was them.
- Yes, we do.

08:46.685 --> 08:49.344
...are necessary in order
to protect this country...

08:50.080 --> 08:52.322
Cache ping from last week.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.096
A confidential white paper from the NSC,

08:55.261 --> 08:59.026
breaking down potential terror
attacks against soft targets...

08:59.099 --> 09:01.907
I-I looked into it,
but nothing came of it.

09:01.993 --> 09:05.428
So, I figured it was part
of a plan they abandoned.

09:05.524 --> 09:06.963
I'm sorry to see that wasn't true.

09:07.110 --> 09:08.364
Why bomb a mall?

09:08.458 --> 09:10.932
To create panic? To generate fear?

09:11.333 --> 09:12.997
No.

09:13.404 --> 09:14.936
To play politics.

09:15.176 --> 09:18.542
Today at 8:00 p.m.,
the House of Representatives

09:18.567 --> 09:21.347
has a vote scheduled on S-322,

09:21.574 --> 09:24.195
the National Entry/Exit Registry System.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.864
You mean the Muslim registry?

09:25.954 --> 09:28.533
Technically, it's a system
to allow Homeland

09:28.665 --> 09:31.536
to register and track
non-citizen visa holders

09:31.610 --> 09:33.119
from countries of concern.

09:33.291 --> 09:37.318
Those countries just happen to
be exclusively Arab or Muslim.

09:37.384 --> 09:39.666
But NEERS already failed twice.

09:39.691 --> 09:40.592
Why now?

09:40.617 --> 09:43.447
Terror, fear, spilt blood
in the heartland,

09:43.523 --> 09:46.257
and a Muslim immigrant
mastermind framed for the crime.

09:46.359 --> 09:49.968
She has a name... Raina Amin.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.457
Raina came to us on the run from
a team that staged her apartment

09:53.492 --> 09:55.670
to look like she could have
planned an attack like this.

09:55.694 --> 09:58.302
This isn't a coincidence.
We think she's being framed.

09:58.373 --> 10:01.779
I'll put money the FBI releases her
name as a suspect within the hour.

10:01.865 --> 10:03.914
This attack is about one thing...

10:04.068 --> 10:06.656
pushing Congress to pass the registry.

10:06.771 --> 10:08.922
This team was created to put an end

10:09.156 --> 10:11.164
to the rogue group of agents
within the CIA

10:11.219 --> 10:14.492
working on behalf of
eight power players in America.

10:14.742 --> 10:17.273
Today, that mission takes on
this form...

10:17.348 --> 10:20.849
make sure S-322 goes down in flames.

10:20.945 --> 10:22.517
That registry cannot happen.

10:22.593 --> 10:24.151
We cannot allow the Collaborators

10:24.187 --> 10:26.397
to take the next step
in their long-term plan.

10:26.422 --> 10:29.724
You're talking about FBI agents
and CIA operatives

10:29.759 --> 10:32.030
actively interfering
with the democratic process.

10:32.055 --> 10:35.195
Look, I know that we cross a lot
of lines, but that's a big one.

10:35.288 --> 10:37.624
The Constitution isn't a suicide pact.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.277
The Collaborators
took the gloves off first.

10:39.301 --> 10:40.734
We're just following suit.

10:40.780 --> 10:42.630
How does that fit in
to their long-term plan?

10:42.655 --> 10:43.675
And what is that plan?

10:43.700 --> 10:45.283
Shouldn't that be what
we're trying to figure out?

10:45.307 --> 10:47.645
Well, we will when we have
the luxury of time,

10:47.731 --> 10:49.543
but for now, we got to stop this bill.

10:49.578 --> 10:51.211
It's been out of the Senate for months.

10:51.314 --> 10:53.447
The House is the holdup.

10:53.548 --> 10:54.978
We have a few things
we need to figure out.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.033
Where are the votes? Who are the swings?

10:57.091 --> 10:58.892
And how do we push this thing to defeat?

10:58.994 --> 11:01.286
We also need to figure out
who's framing Raina.

11:01.366 --> 11:04.288
If they work for the Collaborators
and we expose their hand in this,

11:04.390 --> 11:06.968
maybe we could reverse this wave
of fear fueling the vote.

11:07.070 --> 11:08.866
Good. Take point on that.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.663
The rest of you, huddle up.

11:10.731 --> 11:12.363
This is now our war room.

11:14.768 --> 11:16.512
Golden Boy's back in his element.

11:16.603 --> 11:18.870
After watching you
kick down doors and shoot guns,

11:18.958 --> 11:20.572
now you get to see what I can do.

11:22.643 --> 11:25.957
This is the playing field.
435 votes decide the game.

11:26.058 --> 11:28.298
So, how many Republicans
do we need to flip to vote "no"?

11:28.378 --> 11:31.057
Depends on how many Democrats
we can flip to vote "no," too.

11:31.082 --> 11:33.651
The Democrats are voting
for the Muslim registry?

11:33.686 --> 11:36.319
My state representative's
a Democrat. He voted for it.

11:36.413 --> 11:38.952
Law and order's one of those
issues that crosses party lines.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.718
9/11, Iraq.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.523
It's hard to vote against fear
when fear's so fresh.

11:43.795 --> 11:45.691
So, how do we I.D. our targets?

11:45.786 --> 11:48.247
Good question. Tough one, too.

11:48.299 --> 11:49.632
This is a radioactive issue.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.910
People will hide their votes
until the last minute.

11:51.935 --> 11:53.235
So, the key for us

11:53.310 --> 11:55.800
is to know these men and women
for who they really are,

11:56.066 --> 11:57.143
strip away politics,

11:57.168 --> 11:58.948
figure out how they play
when the chips are down.

11:58.972 --> 12:00.050
And how do we do that?

12:00.075 --> 12:01.105
The FBI and the CIA

12:01.130 --> 12:03.445
don't exactly keep oppo research
on lawmakers.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.915
No, but I do.

12:13.657 --> 12:15.423
No, no. Go back. Her.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.304
Ginny Kearns, ex-military.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.330
And she was working the G20
as a security consultant.

12:23.390 --> 12:25.392
She has to be connected to the AIC.

12:25.868 --> 12:27.101
Gun for hire, maybe?

12:27.197 --> 12:30.471
And if she had a partner, it has
to be someone that she trusted.

12:30.506 --> 12:33.173
Pull up K.A.s.
Maybe I could recognize him, too.

12:33.271 --> 12:35.259
Known associates. Good idea.

12:37.545 --> 12:39.856
I don't understand something, Raina.

12:39.881 --> 12:43.325
The government covered up
everything that happened at the G20.

12:43.852 --> 12:45.019
They didn't release your name.

12:45.043 --> 12:46.720
Why are the AIC after you?

12:46.817 --> 12:49.120
Because I was investigating them, Alex.

12:50.558 --> 12:52.682
It should have never been covered up.

12:52.827 --> 12:55.127
Someone had to try to expose them.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.925
- Raina...
- I called the other survivors.

12:58.034 --> 13:01.443
I tried to put together
the real story of what happened.

13:01.535 --> 13:04.870
LeÃ³n Velez... you know him, right?
He was doing the same.

13:04.905 --> 13:07.670
We were supposed to meet,
but he never showed up.

13:15.448 --> 13:17.862
Um, I think I should leave.

13:17.951 --> 13:19.483
It's best if you stay.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.853
I want to talk to you alone.

13:23.143 --> 13:26.196
I'll be upstairs, and you'll be fine.

13:31.630 --> 13:33.345
- I'm glad you're safe.
- Good.

13:33.462 --> 13:35.744
Now that you know I'm safe,
you can leave.

13:35.968 --> 13:39.502
We haven't spoken for weeks,
and that's all you have to say to me?

13:42.740 --> 13:44.195
There's nothing left to say.

13:44.452 --> 13:45.984
Look...

13:46.593 --> 13:49.560
all I wanted was to hear your voice.
If something had happened to you...

13:49.585 --> 13:52.748
Something did happen to me,
and I survived it without you.

13:52.780 --> 13:54.339
I don't need you, Nimah.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.753
And you need Alex?

13:58.840 --> 14:00.458
I trust Alex.

14:00.557 --> 14:02.114
And you can't trust me?

14:02.225 --> 14:06.606
The person who used me
at the G20, manipulated me,

14:06.926 --> 14:08.559
and lied to me?

14:08.665 --> 14:10.712
I'm still your sister.

14:10.834 --> 14:14.298
And you know very well
who I am beneath my mistakes.

14:14.404 --> 14:15.936
That's the problem.

14:22.812 --> 14:24.978
Hey. You okay?

14:25.014 --> 14:26.724
Just came to change my clothes.

14:26.749 --> 14:27.960
There's not much need for long johns

14:27.984 --> 14:29.761
if I'm gonna be hanging out
in the bunker all day.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.913
You look disappointed.

14:32.021 --> 14:34.148
Who would've thought you liked
to ski so much?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.454
It bothers you.

14:36.524 --> 14:38.570
I just don't believe it.

14:38.659 --> 14:39.826
Why didn't I know about it?

14:39.937 --> 14:41.460
Well, maybe you never asked.

14:44.866 --> 14:46.232
- I'm... I'm...
- I know.

14:49.593 --> 14:50.637
Hello?

14:50.662 --> 14:51.770
Alex Parrish?

14:51.805 --> 14:53.581
This is Tyler Dinucci, Baltimore P.D.

14:53.730 --> 14:55.448
I'm calling about LeÃ³n Velez.

14:55.542 --> 14:57.634
All right, we've narrowed
down the representatives

14:57.659 --> 14:59.730
who can make or break this vote.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.294
The Honorable Kyle Stutz...
Republican, California.

15:04.384 --> 15:05.917
When he supported marriage equality,

15:05.953 --> 15:08.819
activists tried to primary him,
and they lost.

15:08.855 --> 15:11.786
He will buck party lines again
if we can give him a reason to.

15:11.858 --> 15:14.876
Jihane Hassane...
Democrat, Michigan's third,

15:14.961 --> 15:17.862
a Sikh who needs to prove
she's tough on terrorism.

15:17.947 --> 15:19.884
Jim Kreigsman... Democrat, Ohio.

15:19.966 --> 15:21.775
He lost a son in Afghanistan.

15:21.834 --> 15:23.486
Gold-plated NatSec credentials.

15:23.511 --> 15:25.792
If we can get him, the rest
of the Dems will fall in line.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.804
And finally, Meredith Cardenas,

15:27.863 --> 15:30.855
the first and only member of
the Republicans' Latina caucus,

15:31.363 --> 15:33.875
who understands Latinos
could be the next ones

15:33.900 --> 15:35.143
in the cross hairs of this registry.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.368
That's a lot of names and not much time.

15:37.587 --> 15:39.548
We knew it was gonna be
an uphill battle.

15:39.584 --> 15:40.962
Let's not give up now.

15:41.018 --> 15:43.055
Shelby, Nimah, Ryan, you're with me.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.753
How do we know they're the key votes?

15:44.789 --> 15:46.238
I've got a friend
in the Speaker's office

15:46.262 --> 15:47.503
who can tell us
if we're on the right path.

15:47.527 --> 15:49.159
You mean Henry Roarke's office?

15:49.184 --> 15:51.848
That better be one hell of a friend.
His boss is a Collaborator.

15:52.137 --> 15:55.030
The asset I've been working used to
report on Capitol Hill lifestyle.

15:55.065 --> 15:58.107
She can fill the gaps on our oppo work
and tell us what we're missing.

15:58.268 --> 16:01.091
Fold her in. We can use
all the help we can get.

16:01.271 --> 16:03.037
Any luck I.D.'ing Raina's attacker?

16:03.115 --> 16:05.206
We have a name... Tony Vincent,

16:05.241 --> 16:08.009
a buddy from Ginny Kearns' unit
in Afghanistan.

16:08.078 --> 16:09.911
They found work together
as hired hit men

16:09.946 --> 16:11.445
after their enlistment ended.

16:11.539 --> 16:13.614
Alex and I will find this man,
question him,

16:13.649 --> 16:15.070
and clear Raina's name.

16:15.150 --> 16:16.482
Do it.

16:20.122 --> 16:21.397
You worried?

16:21.457 --> 16:22.590
Don't be. I got you.

16:22.657 --> 16:25.614
No, no. Th-That's not it. Um...

16:27.257 --> 16:31.140
So, Raina told me she'd been
in contact with LeÃ³n Velez,

16:31.499 --> 16:34.405
but he'd gone dark.
So, I made a few calls.

16:34.937 --> 16:37.177
His landlord just found him an hour ago,

16:37.365 --> 16:40.044
dead in his bathtub.

16:40.174 --> 16:41.685
Suicide.

16:42.009 --> 16:43.857
They got to him, Owen.

16:44.078 --> 16:45.823
The same people who are trying
to get to Raina.

16:45.847 --> 16:49.047
I... I didn't want to alarm
anyone, so...

16:49.082 --> 16:50.290
No, no. You're right not to.

16:50.315 --> 16:51.916
We'll just let them do the work
right now

16:51.995 --> 16:54.885
while we track down whoever
killed LeÃ³n and attacked Raina.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.745
All right?

16:58.992 --> 17:01.926
Hey, you still have that friend
in Capitol Hill Police?

17:02.007 --> 17:04.162
I need credentials
on Sasha Barinov, fast.

17:04.196 --> 17:05.459
I can make the call.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.964
- Is her record clear?
- Of course.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.133
Good, because if she has
any skeletons in her closet,

17:10.169 --> 17:11.401
they will find them.

17:13.137 --> 17:14.377
All right, everyone,

17:14.463 --> 17:17.688
the fate of 3 1/2 million
Americans rests on us.

17:17.713 --> 17:19.627
That's how many Muslims
there are in this country.

17:19.651 --> 17:21.775
The only people that can stop them
from losing their civil liberty

17:21.799 --> 17:23.239
are standing in this room right now.

17:24.147 --> 17:26.082
The vote's in six hours.
Let's get this done.

17:26.117 --> 17:27.258
Good luck.

17:37.173 --> 17:40.087
- That's not what we agreed upon...
- Guess someone's in a hurry.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.897
It's a big day. Places to be,
civil liberties to erode.

17:42.932 --> 17:44.244
So, what's the plan?

17:44.334 --> 17:46.174
The registry is on track
for an 8:00 p.m. vote,

17:46.202 --> 17:48.502
so we have little time to stop it.

17:48.537 --> 17:50.181
We need to make sure
the swing votes we I.D.'d

17:50.205 --> 17:51.372
will indeed swing.

17:51.407 --> 17:53.536
Oh, Sasha's here.
Credentials came through.

17:53.598 --> 17:55.954
I'll connect with her and see what
she knows that we don't, all right?

17:55.978 --> 17:57.422
I don't understand
how we're gonna do this.

17:57.446 --> 17:59.069
Even if we have all of the right names,

17:59.094 --> 18:01.373
what can we do to talk anyone
into voting "no"?

18:01.398 --> 18:03.897
I've got access to the President
to offer.

18:04.011 --> 18:06.466
You've got the purse strings of
an important defense contractor.

18:06.490 --> 18:08.490
And I will put a face on this registry

18:08.525 --> 18:10.392
and remind them of what really matters.

18:10.427 --> 18:12.060
But first, we start with Felix Cordova.

18:12.095 --> 18:13.995
Why would he help us?
He works for the enemy.

18:14.147 --> 18:15.913
He's my friend.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.932
I know him. He'll play ball.

18:30.611 --> 18:32.923
Looking for a better view
of the foliage?

18:33.205 --> 18:35.032
What do you think
is waiting for us there?

18:35.117 --> 18:37.951
Just a man who needs to answer
a few questions. That's all.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.113
How do we know Vincent's even there?

18:40.138 --> 18:42.950
Well, the land is in his name,
power and water are running.

18:43.024 --> 18:45.302
What if he doesn't talk?

18:45.913 --> 18:48.308
This man is the only person
who can point his finger

18:48.333 --> 18:50.002
at all the Collaborators.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.776
He'll talk. I'll make sure of it.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.720
This seems easy for you.

18:54.802 --> 18:56.227
I mean, I know you've taught this,

18:56.252 --> 18:58.735
but you haven't done anything
like this in decades.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.790
Well, that's why it's so easy.

18:59.814 --> 19:01.546
I've spent 20 years
with my wings clipped,

19:01.571 --> 19:04.470
not being allowed to be the man
I knew I really was.

19:04.578 --> 19:05.611
Now I can.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.122
I'm sorry I'm late. Big day.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.829
You brought friends.

19:22.134 --> 19:23.534
And you are...

19:23.663 --> 19:24.828
Nimah Amin.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.165
Would you like me to spell this
for your little registry?

19:28.234 --> 19:29.845
You're funny.

19:29.925 --> 19:31.267
It's not funny to us.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.680
And it shouldn't be to you, either.

19:32.704 --> 19:33.936
There's no way the guy I know

19:33.972 --> 19:36.183
believes in singling out an
entire religion as the bad guy.

19:36.207 --> 19:37.374
I'm not in charge.

19:37.409 --> 19:38.575
You're an immigrant.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.209
How can you come to this country

19:40.245 --> 19:43.492
and then work to deprive other
immigrants of their rights?

19:43.517 --> 19:44.814
You live in a bubble.

19:44.849 --> 19:47.977
Elites like you don't understand the
concerns of everyday Americans.

19:48.002 --> 19:49.829
Says the guy with a family crest.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.520
I am an everyday American.

19:53.009 --> 19:56.506
Hey, we know you're
in a bind here, Felix.

19:56.594 --> 19:58.827
Publicly, you have to support your boss,

19:58.862 --> 20:01.645
but secretly, maybe you're
hoping this whole registry

20:01.670 --> 20:03.532
goes down in flames.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.065
We can help make that happen.

20:05.101 --> 20:07.101
All you have to do is give us the names

20:07.136 --> 20:08.710
of the swing votes
you're targeting to win.

20:08.734 --> 20:09.870
We will do the rest.

20:09.906 --> 20:11.406
No one will ever know.

20:11.492 --> 20:16.187
Stutz? Cardenas? Kreigsman?
Mullen? Hassane?

20:16.407 --> 20:17.740
Who are we missing?

20:17.814 --> 20:19.658
Tell us.

20:19.814 --> 20:21.494
I can't.

20:23.952 --> 20:28.422
I can't tell you about Abelard
or Bowers or Charleton.

20:28.495 --> 20:32.503
I can't tell you about Dowery or Gomez.

20:32.594 --> 20:35.003
And I definitely can't tell you
about Folte.

20:36.965 --> 20:38.527
Let's move.

20:39.557 --> 20:41.099
Come back anytime, Ms. Amin.

20:42.169 --> 20:46.072
I'll wait for your funeral,
you right-wing sellout.

20:57.451 --> 20:59.604
Hands where I can see them.

21:00.143 --> 21:02.034
Who are you? Why are you here?

21:05.024 --> 21:06.339
You're about to find out.

21:17.803 --> 21:19.737
Hey. What's the word?

21:19.850 --> 21:21.171
Oh, not even a "hello"?

21:21.206 --> 21:23.630
Clock's ticking. My team needs to know
what's happening with the vote.

21:23.654 --> 21:25.175
Your names check out on my end,

21:25.256 --> 21:27.287
though you can take Mullen off the list.

21:27.338 --> 21:29.739
Roarke finally okayed the money
for a regional airport

21:29.773 --> 21:30.896
with his name on it.

21:30.921 --> 21:33.159
Now even God couldn't
change him to a "no."

21:33.413 --> 21:35.420
Well, it's nice to see you
in your element.

21:35.445 --> 21:38.218
Well, I'd rather be out of it with you.

21:38.322 --> 21:39.689
We'll get there.

21:39.816 --> 21:41.785
Grab me when you know more, okay?

21:45.463 --> 21:47.707
Did you know this was gonna happen?

21:47.831 --> 21:49.431
Am I just an asset you're working?

21:51.294 --> 21:52.370
Not "just," no.

21:52.497 --> 21:54.793
But an asset, first and foremost.

21:54.888 --> 21:58.466
Look, people like us... we help
each other out when we need it.

21:58.997 --> 22:01.610
Doesn't mean everything else
doesn't matter.

22:01.716 --> 22:03.958
No, I guess it doesn't.

22:04.346 --> 22:06.027
- I got to go, okay?
- Mm-mh.

22:06.052 --> 22:08.864
- When this is over with...
- The lift tickets are on you?

22:09.456 --> 22:11.489
That's fair.

22:11.587 --> 22:12.819
- Go.
- Okay.

22:15.224 --> 22:16.686
Mullen's out.

22:16.818 --> 22:19.561
That takes one name off
the list, a name that we need.

22:19.670 --> 22:21.466
If our math is right,
we'll have to convince

22:21.491 --> 22:24.184
all of the remaining targets
to vote "no."

22:24.265 --> 22:27.033
What "Black Mirror" episode
did we wake up in?

22:27.122 --> 22:29.770
How can any American
support the Muslim registry?

22:29.838 --> 22:31.504
Most everyone I grew up with would.

22:31.598 --> 22:33.172
My sorority sisters would.

22:33.207 --> 22:35.321
Hell, once upon a time,
I would have, too.

22:35.415 --> 22:38.735
FBI work taught me better,
but still, I understand.

22:38.906 --> 22:40.954
You're apologizing for those people?

22:41.065 --> 22:43.321
Those people are a part of this country.

22:43.346 --> 22:45.984
If you ignore their voice, how
can you expect them to hear yours?

22:46.019 --> 22:47.236
Look, I'm not saying they're right.

22:47.260 --> 22:48.765
I'm saying they have a right
to their opinion.

22:48.789 --> 22:51.089
Ah, the real America...

22:51.272 --> 22:54.159
two blond people arguing
the merits of my freedom

22:54.194 --> 22:56.084
instead of letting me have it.

22:56.295 --> 22:59.106
The fact that this is even
happening is an atrocity.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.165
We've learned nothing from history.

23:04.073 --> 23:06.486
Turn those votes.

23:11.077 --> 23:13.176
Ms. Wyatt, I'm not afraid
to cross the aisle

23:13.211 --> 23:14.818
when it matters, but the nation

23:14.843 --> 23:16.616
is already reacting on both sides.

23:16.679 --> 23:19.757
Pro- and anti-Muslim protests
are already forming.

23:19.885 --> 23:21.849
I can't afford to alienate my base.

23:21.936 --> 23:24.346
You won't be if you give
your district a big enough win

23:24.371 --> 23:25.986
on the employment front...

23:26.088 --> 23:27.571
say, a new McGregor-Wyatt plant

23:27.596 --> 23:29.191
and a thousand jobs to go with it.

23:29.226 --> 23:31.341
I have to worry about my job first.

23:31.496 --> 23:34.505
I just can't take the risk. My apologies.

23:36.467 --> 23:38.536
I'm not just a Sikh or a woman.

23:38.622 --> 23:41.506
I'm a red-state Democrat.
That's three strikes.

23:41.624 --> 23:43.405
The last thing I can do
at a time like this

23:43.440 --> 23:45.607
is vote my conscience
over my constituents.

23:45.642 --> 23:48.059
Well, you may not want
your faith to define you,

23:48.084 --> 23:51.240
but this bill defines my people
by theirs.

23:51.308 --> 23:54.060
- How is that okay?
- I'm sorry.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.396
I've made it too far to lose it all now.

23:59.683 --> 24:02.175
Look, Congressman, you know me.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.681
I briefed President Todd on
the threats of Islamic terror.

24:04.706 --> 24:07.728
I've personally had boots on
the ground in these countries.

24:07.808 --> 24:09.946
I know a dangerous policy
when I see one.

24:10.032 --> 24:13.773
- A list isn't dangerous.
- No, in and of itself, no, it's not, okay?

24:13.798 --> 24:16.603
But when you create a list, you're
also creating a recruitment tool.

24:16.681 --> 24:20.531
It's making it easier for a kid
to choose a life of suicide vests

24:20.556 --> 24:21.795
over anything else.

24:21.820 --> 24:22.828
Believe me when I tell you

24:22.852 --> 24:25.343
this is making us
more vulnerable, not less.

24:25.446 --> 24:27.813
America is scared, and so am I.

24:27.874 --> 24:29.702
They want action.

24:29.784 --> 24:32.284
My vote is "yes," and I'm not sorry.

24:33.436 --> 24:35.693
Why is it every time a Muslim
kills someone in this country,

24:35.717 --> 24:38.015
he's a terrorist, but, you know,
if a white man does it,

24:38.040 --> 24:39.720
he's simply disturbed?

24:39.826 --> 24:43.175
Save that claptrap for
your buddies in the lamestream media.

24:43.261 --> 24:45.363
My vote's "yes," and it's rock-solid.

24:45.464 --> 24:48.110
Your mother should know better than
sending you in here like this.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.435
It's embarrassing.

24:56.484 --> 24:58.484
This is impossible. No one's budging.

24:58.564 --> 25:00.493
If these are the swing votes,
we're screwed.

25:00.526 --> 25:02.179
- What's the play?
- I don't know.

25:02.260 --> 25:03.547
You don't know?

25:03.583 --> 25:04.828
- I thought you were the speech writer...
- Hello?

25:04.852 --> 25:06.483
...strategist of our generation.

25:06.563 --> 25:09.453
Jon Favreau would know what to do.
Maybe we should call him.

25:15.552 --> 25:17.220
You have a problem.

25:17.314 --> 25:18.322
What's wrong?

25:18.396 --> 25:21.430
FBI counterintelligence
has Sasha Barinov flagged

25:21.466 --> 25:23.543
as a possible FSB asset.

25:23.637 --> 25:25.534
She's not a Russian spy.

25:25.613 --> 25:28.705
Well, my Capitol Police friend
just heard back from the FBI

25:28.730 --> 25:30.839
after helping us
with Sasha's credentials.

25:30.874 --> 25:32.652
I thought you should know.

25:32.776 --> 25:35.243
Sir, we've received a complaint
and have been instructed

25:35.270 --> 25:36.590
to escort you out of the building.

25:36.614 --> 25:38.130
Complaint? From whom?

25:40.341 --> 25:42.114
Felix.

25:43.087 --> 25:45.591
He sent us after the wrong congressmen.

25:46.155 --> 25:48.055
Did you have a nice field trip today?

25:50.059 --> 25:52.319
It's nothing personal, just politics.

25:52.428 --> 25:53.794
But I want to say thanks.

25:53.881 --> 25:56.514
I had a lot of undecideds
who hate your mother,

25:56.633 --> 25:59.647
and seeing you do her dirty work
helped bring them home.

25:59.769 --> 26:02.002
It won't even be a narrow margin now.

26:04.601 --> 26:06.429
Sir, we have to go.

26:11.271 --> 26:12.491
Come on.

26:17.485 --> 26:18.684
Who do you work for?

26:18.753 --> 26:21.486
You're gonna find out yourself
the longer you keep me here.

26:21.558 --> 26:24.542
Did you kill LeÃ³n Velez?
Frame Raina Amin?

26:24.625 --> 26:26.580
That was you in Central Park.

26:26.661 --> 26:28.293
You put Rebecca Sherman up to that?

26:29.764 --> 26:30.896
That's a "yes."

26:30.971 --> 26:33.697
You better stop asking questions
and start answering them.

26:33.768 --> 26:36.681
No. You better get out of here.

26:36.770 --> 26:37.923
I messed up.

26:38.004 --> 26:39.270
They'll be coming for me.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.658
They? Who's they?

26:40.707 --> 26:41.814
How'd you mess up?

26:41.875 --> 26:44.627
The cops were supposed to find
Amin's body in the mall.

26:44.678 --> 26:45.810
She got away.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.315
The people who hired me
are gonna find me and kill me

26:48.378 --> 26:51.135
unless you let me grab my go-bag
and we all get out of here.

26:51.221 --> 26:53.218
You let me go and I will
tell you everything...

26:53.632 --> 26:56.731
who I work for,
who's next on their list.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.833
Harry Doyle...

27:06.496 --> 27:08.229
He's still alive!

27:14.058 --> 27:15.745
Two shooters, maybe three.

27:18.566 --> 27:20.970
- Who's out there? Who hired you?
- Cut me loose and I'll tell you.

27:20.994 --> 27:22.861
- Tell us now!
- Or what...

27:30.760 --> 27:32.448
What do we do now?

27:32.534 --> 27:33.917
Owen?

27:34.006 --> 27:36.089
Owen, we need a plan!

27:36.134 --> 27:38.782
I know. Just... let me think.

27:47.456 --> 27:48.755
Owen, listen to me.

27:48.790 --> 27:50.990
Break Tony's restraints.
Put your gun in his hand.

27:51.025 --> 27:52.378
I'll cover you.

27:53.027 --> 27:54.060
I got it.

28:07.875 --> 28:10.175
How'd it go? Did what I give you help?

28:10.222 --> 28:12.132
- Oh, can't use it.
- Why not?

28:12.242 --> 28:14.625
Well, because I don't know
if I can trust you.

28:14.726 --> 28:17.447
Why does the FBI have you
flagged as a Russian asset?

28:17.525 --> 28:20.275
- That's ridiculous.
- No, no, no. You don't get on that list

28:20.368 --> 28:22.101
without a major paper trail
to back it up.

28:22.126 --> 28:23.660
They know something.

28:23.767 --> 28:24.824
Who are you?

28:24.891 --> 28:27.625
- Ryan, you're scaring me.
- You better start talking right now.

28:27.691 --> 28:29.316
- I'm leaving.
- Are you working me?

28:29.558 --> 28:31.073
Did you compromise me?

28:32.098 --> 28:33.865
Who do you work for?

28:36.134 --> 28:37.772
It's not what you think.

28:38.545 --> 28:42.272
You're watching the
House Session vote on bill S-322,

28:42.350 --> 28:44.208
the National Entry/Exit Registry System.

28:44.233 --> 28:45.975
BombÃ³nes?

28:46.077 --> 28:48.178
My mother sends them every week.

28:48.747 --> 28:49.979
No?

28:50.530 --> 28:52.218
Okay.

28:56.621 --> 28:58.287
Even if I wanted to stop this vote...

28:58.357 --> 29:01.154
and I don't... it's already happening.

29:01.382 --> 29:02.391
We won.

29:02.468 --> 29:06.729
You can get on the phone,
beg, plead, lie.

29:06.764 --> 29:09.597
They will listen to you because they'll
think you disagree with Roarke.

29:09.655 --> 29:10.765
Why would I do that?

29:10.801 --> 29:13.750
Because there's more at stake
than we can tell you...

29:13.938 --> 29:15.032
and because deep down,

29:15.057 --> 29:18.072
you know that singling out
an entire faith is wrong.

29:19.539 --> 29:21.174
Okay.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.745
Okay, what if I tell you
one of the chocolates

29:23.780 --> 29:25.315
in this bowl could kill you?

29:25.711 --> 29:27.588
Would you play it safe?

29:27.708 --> 29:30.148
Or would you take a chance and grab one?

29:35.632 --> 29:38.437
These are people we're talking about,

29:38.531 --> 29:41.118
not cheap political props.

29:43.704 --> 29:45.603
It wasn't my choice.

29:46.637 --> 29:50.644
I hated Russia, what they do
to their people.

29:51.747 --> 29:55.363
I got out as soon as I could,
but my parents are still there.

29:55.651 --> 29:59.550
They're too poor to leave,
too weak to protect themselves.

29:59.887 --> 30:04.218
All I have to do is help the FSB
with a little information

30:04.243 --> 30:06.806
from time to time and they stay safe.

30:07.228 --> 30:08.970
That's all.

30:09.597 --> 30:10.996
Did you tell them about me?

30:11.063 --> 30:13.700
Of course not. I would never.

30:14.936 --> 30:18.470
Ryan, please, you have to believe me.

30:18.580 --> 30:24.142
You grew up here... with real
freedom, without fear.

30:28.515 --> 30:30.515
You don't know what this is like.

30:42.753 --> 30:45.578
I've seen firsthand what people will do

30:45.649 --> 30:47.431
to protect the ones that they love.

30:47.467 --> 30:49.462
I know you're not lying.

30:49.602 --> 30:50.967
I know who you are.

31:23.994 --> 31:25.864
Mr. Cordova...

31:26.012 --> 31:27.088
Felix.

31:27.192 --> 31:29.103
You're from Madrid, right?

31:29.184 --> 31:32.473
Your father is the ambassador
to the United States.

31:32.554 --> 31:34.116
So?

31:34.211 --> 31:36.088
You lived in Madrid in '04.

31:36.538 --> 31:38.288
What are you still doing here?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.953
If memory serves, your sister...

31:42.187 --> 31:46.108
she died at the Al-Qaeda train bombing.

31:47.468 --> 31:49.133
Okay, this is not about my sister.

31:49.169 --> 31:50.902
All hate comes from somewhere.

31:52.836 --> 31:55.758
I do not hate, Ms. Amin.

31:55.876 --> 31:58.859
I just know myself what terrorism
can do if it's not eradicated.

31:58.945 --> 32:00.562
So do I!

32:01.717 --> 32:03.491
So do I.

32:03.716 --> 32:07.685
It can spur violence
against innocent men and women,

32:07.720 --> 32:11.425
destroy families, stoke imaginary fears

32:11.450 --> 32:12.690
against the other.

32:12.778 --> 32:14.809
It's already too late.

32:14.927 --> 32:18.027
S-322 passes by six votes.

32:18.114 --> 32:20.697
It's out of our hands and
into the President's now.

32:20.782 --> 32:22.790
The president will veto it.

32:22.868 --> 32:24.587
That's what I told Roarke.

32:24.669 --> 32:26.602
He said he doesn't care.

32:26.705 --> 32:28.157
Of course.

32:28.239 --> 32:29.672
That's what this is about.

32:31.007 --> 32:32.386
This is about keeping America safe...

32:32.410 --> 32:33.742
Shut up.

32:34.011 --> 32:35.648
Excuse me.

32:37.484 --> 32:40.070
- We have to leave right now.
- Why?

32:40.373 --> 32:42.362
They identified the bomber.

32:51.046 --> 32:53.178
I know what you're gonna say.

32:55.228 --> 32:56.861
We're safe now.

32:56.983 --> 33:00.588
- Doesn't matter.
- I got in my head and you didn't.

33:03.808 --> 33:07.319
I got grounded years ago
because of a simple mistake.

33:07.410 --> 33:09.371
I always told myself it was a fluke,

33:09.446 --> 33:11.004
could have happened to anybody,
but it didn't.

33:11.028 --> 33:13.098
It happened to me...

33:13.683 --> 33:15.403
because I screwed up.

33:17.192 --> 33:21.145
And I've spent all the years since then
landlocked on the Farm,

33:21.246 --> 33:24.403
safe from discovering
what we both learned today...

33:24.560 --> 33:27.290
that I don't have what it takes
when it comes down to it.

33:27.415 --> 33:29.106
That is not true.

33:32.568 --> 33:34.835
I'm not the man I wish I was.

33:42.259 --> 33:43.414
Where are we?

33:43.485 --> 33:45.649
Where are we? We failed.

33:45.747 --> 33:49.691
Raina Amin's been framed, a bill
to create a Muslim registry

33:49.716 --> 33:51.656
is sitting on the President's
desk waiting to be signed,

33:51.680 --> 33:54.849
and the worst part is, we never
stood a chance to stop it.

33:54.974 --> 33:56.863
This has always been about
Claire, always has been.

33:56.887 --> 33:58.645
She's what the Collaborators want.

33:58.759 --> 34:01.534
I mean, this... this isn't about
religious freedom or... or liberty.

34:01.559 --> 34:03.907
It's about forcing the last
person standing in their way

34:03.932 --> 34:06.466
to veto this bill,
which they know that she will.

34:07.047 --> 34:10.063
Whatever happens next
will be perceived as her fault.

34:11.371 --> 34:13.245
I should have seen this coming.

34:13.362 --> 34:16.346
These people planted the seeds
for this for months, years.

34:17.672 --> 34:19.047
I mean, they're playing chess,

34:19.072 --> 34:20.844
and we can't even find the board.

34:21.947 --> 34:23.822
Where are you going?

34:23.949 --> 34:25.610
I have to call the President.

34:30.822 --> 34:32.635
- What's this?
- Our room.

34:32.715 --> 34:35.096
- I'm not living with you.
- You have no choice.

34:35.197 --> 34:38.378
As far as the world's concerned,
you're guilty of that bombing.

34:38.496 --> 34:40.862
If you leave the Farm now,
you're as good as done.

34:40.967 --> 34:43.072
At least here I can keep you safe.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.971
I'm trapped... again.

34:50.274 --> 34:53.588
And again, it's because of you, Nimah.

34:53.777 --> 34:54.876
If I leave now,

34:55.081 --> 34:58.120
I'm gonna have to pay for
a crime that I did not commit.

34:58.198 --> 35:01.443
And if I stay here,
I'll be in prison anyway.

35:03.406 --> 35:05.226
What if I turn myself in?

35:05.345 --> 35:07.765
For a bombing they said I did?

35:08.093 --> 35:10.755
Just until this team
proves you're innocent.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.716
I'll be you in custody,

35:12.800 --> 35:15.489
and you'll be me, free in
the world, helping fix it.

35:16.099 --> 35:18.138
You would really do this for me?

35:18.435 --> 35:21.473
You just said you're in
this situation because of me.

35:21.940 --> 35:23.715
Let me take the hard part.

35:24.473 --> 35:26.918
- Nimah, you can't...
- Please...

35:28.597 --> 35:30.074
let me fix this.

35:38.819 --> 35:40.157
Going somewhere?

35:45.226 --> 35:46.556
Are you in trouble?

35:46.660 --> 35:48.227
I could ask you the same question.

35:48.306 --> 35:50.796
My asset didn't get flagged
by the CIA as a Russian spy.

35:50.831 --> 35:52.591
Well, Sasha hasn't been accused
of any crime.

35:52.616 --> 35:54.299
She doesn't have to be.

35:54.397 --> 35:55.633
She's compromised, Ryan.

35:55.668 --> 35:57.335
You have to drop her.

35:58.372 --> 35:59.834
- What? What? Say it.
- Well, no, Sa...

35:59.858 --> 36:02.273
No, Sasha's compromised because
she's on some list somewhere?

36:02.382 --> 36:04.554
The same way that your little
backpacking buddy from India,

36:04.578 --> 36:05.943
Amir Salaam, was on a list?

36:05.979 --> 36:07.262
Does that make him compromised?

36:07.287 --> 36:09.529
Does your association with him
make you compromised?

36:09.647 --> 36:11.678
You're putting all of us at risk.

36:11.817 --> 36:14.151
Look, I'm not your soldier, Alex.

36:14.305 --> 36:17.407
I'm not your asset,
and I'm not your fiancÃ©.

36:18.024 --> 36:19.805
You think Sasha's trouble?

36:20.059 --> 36:22.125
Okay. I'll be careful.

36:22.261 --> 36:23.460
The rest is up to me.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.173
And with this veto,

36:33.348 --> 36:36.230
President Haas sends a clear
message to the American people.

36:36.309 --> 36:37.527
"You're on your own."

36:37.610 --> 36:39.871
Now, the rich are safe in their mansions

36:39.944 --> 36:42.451
and their gated communities,
but common, everyday Americans

36:42.476 --> 36:44.043
are left to fend for themselves,

36:44.150 --> 36:46.292
unsure of when the next
jihadist will strike.

36:46.317 --> 36:49.629
And when they do...
and they will, mark my words...

36:49.822 --> 36:51.785
it will be on that woman's shoulders.

36:51.891 --> 36:54.291
And when that happens, you ask her...

36:57.729 --> 36:59.367
That wasn't just rhetoric.

36:59.498 --> 37:01.422
Roarke's laying out his game plan.

37:01.533 --> 37:04.401
Sooner or later, the Collaborators
will stage another attack,

37:04.436 --> 37:07.694
and when they do,
your mother will be done.

37:08.147 --> 37:10.873
Her V.P. nominee has languished
in the Senate for weeks now.

37:10.909 --> 37:12.890
It's not hard to see why.

37:15.568 --> 37:18.105
If she resigns... when she resigns...

37:18.543 --> 37:20.652
we all know who's next in succession.

37:21.144 --> 37:23.801
The Speaker of the House...
Henry Roarke.

37:24.055 --> 37:26.462
A Collaborator as President.

37:26.790 --> 37:28.517
They'll have it all.

37:30.197 --> 37:32.611
I know that veto hurts Claire
in the short term,

37:32.732 --> 37:34.751
but it was the right thing.

37:35.669 --> 37:37.332
It wasn't what I wanted.

37:38.071 --> 37:40.308
You tried to talk her into signing it.

37:40.473 --> 37:42.261
She didn't listen.

37:42.942 --> 37:45.699
Wow. I am disappointed.

37:47.079 --> 37:50.234
Days like this... they show you
what you're really made of.

37:51.340 --> 37:53.289
Now I know.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.219
So do you.

37:57.623 --> 38:00.321
I know that Congress is willing and able

38:00.346 --> 38:02.618
to work with this President
to help Americans,

38:02.643 --> 38:04.533
but she needs to be
willing to work with us,

38:04.643 --> 38:07.096
the majority Americans elected
to protect them...

38:07.132 --> 38:08.397
to protect their interests.

38:08.422 --> 38:09.448
We will not back down.

38:09.473 --> 38:11.169
You're right.

38:11.269 --> 38:13.364
I should have a plaque made.

38:13.771 --> 38:15.471
Someone took my booth.

38:19.009 --> 38:20.745
Something happen?

38:20.878 --> 38:22.837
More than what's already happened?

38:22.862 --> 38:23.778
No.

38:23.814 --> 38:26.402
- Just some friendly fire.
- Ryan.

38:27.090 --> 38:29.348
- How'd you...
- I can see it on your face.

38:30.354 --> 38:31.884
I might think twice out in the field,

38:31.909 --> 38:34.747
but I've been reading people in the
classroom since the Clinton years.

38:36.317 --> 38:37.823
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

38:37.848 --> 38:40.423
Wow. Look at us, smiling
after almost being killed today.

38:40.495 --> 38:42.103
Here.

38:42.131 --> 38:44.435
And toasting while Rome is burning.

38:44.673 --> 38:46.140
To our own cleverness,

38:46.302 --> 38:48.069
instead of being honest with ourselves.

38:49.067 --> 38:51.839
Alex, I froze today. I thought too much.

38:51.864 --> 38:53.356
- No, don't.
- My instinct... No.

38:53.381 --> 38:55.310
My instinct is gone.

38:56.511 --> 38:59.333
Now, you... I mean, you have...
you have doubts.

38:59.547 --> 39:01.584
We've been over that. But you act first.

39:02.061 --> 39:03.647
If I'm gonna make it out of here alive,

39:03.729 --> 39:05.562
I need to learn to do the same.

39:09.314 --> 39:11.273
And I think maybe
you're the one to teach me.

39:11.903 --> 39:14.337
Me help you? That's...

39:14.372 --> 39:16.639
What a smart man does
who knows his limits...

39:16.664 --> 39:18.287
asks for the help he knows he needs.

39:18.312 --> 39:21.274
So... help me.

39:21.552 --> 39:23.407
Help me trust myself again.

39:23.605 --> 39:27.282
Help me be... who I was...

39:28.602 --> 39:30.752
instead of who I am right now.

39:38.702 --> 39:41.580
The finest Pinot grigio that
your local supermarket sells.

39:41.605 --> 39:44.731
Mm. Funny. I pegged you as more
of an Old World red kind of guy.

39:44.792 --> 39:47.268
I don't even know what that means.

39:50.118 --> 39:52.424
Is the FBI right behind you?

39:52.600 --> 39:55.760
Well, if they are,
they're after me, not you.

39:56.779 --> 39:59.379
I'm trusting you, until you
give me a reason not to.

40:02.417 --> 40:05.644
Trusting is a very stupid
and dangerous habit,

40:05.954 --> 40:07.832
and yet I keep doing it.

40:08.423 --> 40:10.856
You put your neck on the line
to protect the people you love.

40:11.183 --> 40:12.934
You shouldn't have to pay for that.

40:13.695 --> 40:15.061
You gonna open that or what?

40:47.970 --> 40:49.838
Caleb, it's Shelby.

40:49.940 --> 40:52.126
I know you probably
don't want to hear this,

40:52.151 --> 40:54.423
but I think your family
needs you right now.

41:01.806 --> 41:03.240
Proud of yourself?

41:03.275 --> 41:06.011
No. But my boss and my father are.

41:06.410 --> 41:08.548
I'm sorry, Clay. It isn't personal.

41:10.080 --> 41:13.797
Yeah, that's the problem with your side.
It never is, and it should be.

41:13.907 --> 41:15.430
I know what he's doing.

41:15.543 --> 41:17.578
You didn't have a chance to win this.

41:17.678 --> 41:19.745
When I find something you can,
I will let you know.

41:29.191 --> 41:31.418
Remember... always to the right.

41:31.498 --> 41:33.223
I won't let them know we switched.

41:33.285 --> 41:36.638
You will get me out of there
as soon as you can, right?
