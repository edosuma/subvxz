00:00.757 --> 00:02.403
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.424 --> 00:04.218
The person I'm gonna
eliminate tonight

00:04.312 --> 00:05.224
is going downhill.

00:05.247 --> 00:07.098
After a
surprising elimination...

00:07.247 --> 00:08.443
Jamie, you're done.

00:08.599 --> 00:09.900
Jacket off, please.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.333
Told you
I wasn't going home.

00:11.388 --> 00:12.936
The red
team is left reeling...

00:13.038 --> 00:13.919
What just happened?

00:13.974 --> 00:15.875
I am in shock.
I'm still here.

00:15.943 --> 00:17.243
Then, the
teams went head-to-head

00:17.312 --> 00:18.512
in the blind taste test.

00:18.579 --> 00:19.513
Strawberry.
What?

00:19.580 --> 00:20.837
Sardines?

00:20.900 --> 00:22.553
Which proved
challenging for everyone.

00:22.694 --> 00:23.994
Mushrooms?
Lobster.

00:24.061 --> 00:25.595
Except for Elise...

00:25.665 --> 00:26.610
Filet.

00:26.728 --> 00:27.598
Coconut.

00:27.666 --> 00:29.094
Sour cream.
Red Team wins!

00:30.211 --> 00:31.545
Who gave the red
team a come-from-behind victory.

00:31.612 --> 00:32.713
Whoo!

00:32.781 --> 00:34.414
Thank you.

00:34.544 --> 00:37.038
You're welcome, Red Team.
You're welcome.

00:37.554 --> 00:39.464
During steak night
at <i>Hell's Kitchen,</i>

00:39.582 --> 00:40.715
the Blue Team
was in the kitchen

00:40.749 --> 00:41.882
for the first seating.

00:41.950 --> 00:42.776
How you doing, Tommy?

00:42.800 --> 00:43.967
Tommy was silent.

00:44.035 --> 00:45.136
He's not even talking,
this guy!

00:45.203 --> 00:46.570
Tommy, how long?
You need to talk to him!

00:46.638 --> 00:48.805
All three of you
are watching him sink!

00:48.873 --> 00:51.142
And Natalie's
meat station was a hot mess.

00:51.209 --> 00:53.210
I didn't realize it was that
overdone, chef. Wake up!

00:53.278 --> 00:54.811
At the second seating...

00:54.879 --> 00:55.879
You write like
a nine-year-old.

00:55.947 --> 00:57.948
Come on!
Pick it up!

00:58.016 --> 01:00.184
When the Red Team
took their turn in the kitchen...

01:00.252 --> 01:01.352
Hurry up, let's go!
I'm gonna need two minutes.

01:01.419 --> 01:02.886
Their strong start...

01:02.954 --> 01:04.721
Nice. That's called
working as a team.

01:04.789 --> 01:06.257
Quickly deteriorated.

01:06.324 --> 01:07.958
Raw bass.
Unbelievable!

01:08.026 --> 01:09.825
That's burnt.

01:09.893 --> 01:11.927
And then it was
time for the blame game.

01:11.995 --> 01:14.264
When no one else would
step up, and I did?

01:14.331 --> 01:15.998
Shut up for five
seconds!

01:16.066 --> 01:17.567
Both teams lost

01:17.635 --> 01:19.101
and had to nominate
one person.

01:19.170 --> 01:21.304
The Red Team nominated...
Carrie, chef.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.239
- And the Blue Team chose...
- Tommy, chef.

01:23.307 --> 01:24.374
But in the end it was...

01:24.441 --> 01:26.142
Carrie.

01:26.210 --> 01:28.244
Who saw her
dream of becoming head chef

01:28.312 --> 01:31.281
at BLT Steak in New York City
come to an end.

01:31.348 --> 01:33.015
But chef Ramsay...

01:33.083 --> 01:34.584
We're not done yet.

01:34.652 --> 01:36.519
Shocked everyone once again.

01:36.587 --> 01:37.987
Elise...

01:38.055 --> 01:39.389
Me.

01:39.456 --> 01:41.723
Take your jacket off.

01:41.791 --> 01:45.160

02:15.591 --> 02:16.990
Yes!

02:27.936 --> 02:29.370
Wah!

02:42.601 --> 02:46.120
And now, the continuation
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:46.187 --> 02:48.021
I've been thinking
long and hard,

02:48.464 --> 02:50.545
and I've come to a decision.

02:51.926 --> 02:53.994
Elise...

02:54.882 --> 02:56.408
Take your jacket off.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.920
<i>I know you think</i>
<i>you're ready, but...</i>

03:02.434 --> 03:03.734
You're not.

03:05.940 --> 03:07.540
<i>In fact, none of you</i>

03:07.608 --> 03:08.993
are ready.

03:11.146 --> 03:13.417
All of you take
your jackets off.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.852
As from right now,

03:18.134 --> 03:21.520
<i>Hell's Kitchen is closed!</i>

03:22.072 --> 03:23.606
What?

03:25.358 --> 03:27.939
I'm still not convinced

03:28.033 --> 03:29.634
<i>that you have that drive</i>

03:29.702 --> 03:32.635
<i>to become the head chef</i>
<i>at BLT Steak.</i>

03:33.222 --> 03:36.205
You have to get inspired.

03:37.233 --> 03:38.868
<i>So you're all flying</i>

03:38.936 --> 03:40.035
to New York City

03:40.103 --> 03:42.071
<i>first thing tomorrow morning</i>

03:42.138 --> 03:44.941
<i>to see BLT Steak firsthand.</i>

03:45.008 --> 03:46.876
- Are you kidding me?
- Me.

03:46.944 --> 03:49.345
<i>If that doesn't</i>
<i>light a fire in your bellies,</i>

03:49.412 --> 03:51.347
<i>i don't know</i> what will.

03:53.350 --> 03:54.383
<i>You understand?</i>

03:54.451 --> 03:55.250
Yes, chef!

03:55.318 --> 03:56.203
Get out of here!

03:56.219 --> 03:58.067
<i>Get bags packed!</i> 
<i>You're leaving early.</i>

03:58.162 --> 04:00.078
I'm gonna have my eye
on the prize, believe you me.

04:00.153 --> 04:01.895
Not just my lazy eye.
My good eye.

04:05.653 --> 04:07.054
<i>I'm going to New York!</i>

04:07.130 --> 04:08.063
Aah!

04:08.131 --> 04:09.932
Big apple, whoo!

04:09.999 --> 04:12.634
Paul's hittin' New York City!

04:12.702 --> 04:14.502
As part of his master plan,

04:14.570 --> 04:16.370
chef Ramsay has arranged
for the chefs

04:16.439 --> 04:19.241
to experience the culinary
crossroads of the world.

04:19.308 --> 04:21.709
I'm Raheem. I'm your foods
of New York tour guide.

04:21.777 --> 04:23.544
With a tasting
tour of the big apple.

04:23.612 --> 04:25.146
<i>Let's go eat!</i>

04:25.214 --> 04:26.447
First up, Italian.

04:26.514 --> 04:28.049
We can't come to New York City

04:28.117 --> 04:29.717
without hitting up
the best pizzeria.

04:29.785 --> 04:30.651
Ohh.

04:32.988 --> 04:34.622
Oh, my God, let me tell you
something about clam pie.

04:34.689 --> 04:36.423
Off-the-chain delicious.

04:36.491 --> 04:37.925
Excellent.

04:37.993 --> 04:39.260
Put it up there!

04:39.327 --> 04:40.294
Next up on the tour...

04:40.362 --> 04:42.596
Chinese.

04:42.664 --> 04:44.665
The key
to making Peking duck is...

04:44.733 --> 04:45.900
You inflate the duck.

04:45.968 --> 04:48.169
Okay, enjoy your duck.

04:48.237 --> 04:49.603
<i>They're so good.</i>

04:49.671 --> 04:51.239
Dude, what's up next?

04:51.306 --> 04:52.974
French.

04:53.041 --> 04:53.974
<i>Will, what do you think</i>
<i>of that foie gras?</i>

04:54.041 --> 04:55.208
Isn't that amazing?

04:55.277 --> 04:56.243
I mean, the food is so good.

04:56.311 --> 04:58.178
I'm trying to pace myself.

04:58.246 --> 04:59.346
I should probably
eat one.

04:59.414 --> 05:00.947
Ohh!

05:01.015 --> 05:01.915
Greek.

05:01.983 --> 05:02.916
Are we diving in?

05:02.984 --> 05:04.451
These are so good.

05:04.519 --> 05:06.086
This is some of my favorite.

05:06.154 --> 05:07.755
<i>Opa!</i>

05:07.822 --> 05:09.856
Mexican.

05:09.924 --> 05:11.124
<i>Ole!</i>

05:11.192 --> 05:12.259
<i>Carnitas.</i>

05:12.327 --> 05:13.560
I feel a little beat.

05:15.062 --> 05:16.196
Jamaican.

05:16.264 --> 05:17.665
Holy moly.

05:17.732 --> 05:19.400
<i>Got like a little spice</i>
<i>to it.</i>

05:19.467 --> 05:20.501
Oh, man.

05:20.568 --> 05:21.868
Indian.

05:21.936 --> 05:23.203
I couldn't ask
for anything more

05:23.271 --> 05:24.704
than 13, 14 course,
you know.

05:24.772 --> 05:26.206
<i>You guys le e it?</i>  <i>Yeah.</i>

05:26.274 --> 05:27.908
I couldn't do any more.

05:27.975 --> 05:29.075
<i>Are you guys ready for more?</i>

05:29.143 --> 05:30.643
No!

05:30.711 --> 05:32.879
All right. Let's go.

05:32.947 --> 05:34.848
After feasting on the
fabulous flavors of New York,

05:34.916 --> 05:39.119
the chefs head to blt
for a taste of what's at stake.

05:39.187 --> 05:40.320
Ooh.

05:40.387 --> 05:41.521
This is nice.

05:41.588 --> 05:42.355
I know.
This is gorgeous.

05:43.891 --> 05:45.859
Hi. Welcome to BLT Steak.

05:45.927 --> 05:47.327
Hi.

05:47.394 --> 05:48.962
<i>Before I take you</i>
<i>into the kitchen,</i>

05:49.030 --> 05:49.963
let me give you a quick
tour of the restaurant.

05:50.031 --> 05:51.164
<i>Okay.</i> 
<i>Thank you.</i>

05:51.232 --> 05:52.199
So this is
the main dining room.

05:52.266 --> 05:54.234
<i>Wow!</i>

05:54.302 --> 05:56.502
Beautiful.
This is the heart of the restaurant.

05:56.570 --> 05:58.137
It's beautiful.

05:58.205 --> 06:00.239
I'm definitely picturing
my self there.

06:00.307 --> 06:02.641
And it made me
that much more determined

06:02.709 --> 06:04.977
to have that
head chef spot.

06:06.847 --> 06:08.180
<i>So this is the kitchen.</i>

06:08.248 --> 06:09.348
<i>This is amazing.</i> 
<i>Good.</i>

06:09.415 --> 06:10.916
This is a large kitchen

06:10.984 --> 06:12.852
in comparison to a lot
of Manhattan kitchens.

06:12.919 --> 06:14.987
What would you say would be
the hardest thing to adjust to

06:15.055 --> 06:16.488
for somebody who hasn't
worked in New York?

06:16.556 --> 06:17.990
The biggest challenge
for someone

06:18.058 --> 06:18.757
who has not worked
a New York kitchen

06:18.825 --> 06:19.925
<i>is the pace.</i>

06:19.993 --> 06:21.793
<i>We're gonna do between</i>

06:21.862 --> 06:24.196
<i>230 and 250 covers</i>
<i>every single night.</i>

06:24.264 --> 06:26.198
When I close my
eyes, all I imagine

06:26.266 --> 06:28.133
is myself standing
at that pass.

06:28.201 --> 06:30.302
Like, everything now
is coming full circle.

06:30.370 --> 06:32.271
Next time I set foot
in the blt restaurant,

06:32.339 --> 06:34.106
it's gonna be me
with my white coat and my hat.

06:34.174 --> 06:35.874
And they're gonna say,
"congratulations, Paul.

06:35.941 --> 06:37.175
Welcome to the team."

06:37.243 --> 06:38.443
Thank you guys
for coming out.

06:38.511 --> 06:39.310
I wish you all
the best of luck.

06:39.379 --> 06:40.812
Thank you.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.814
If chef Ramsay was trying
to light a fire under our asses

06:42.882 --> 06:44.416
and to get us,
like, motivated,

06:44.484 --> 06:47.419
this trip definitely
did its job.

06:47.487 --> 06:49.654
Oohrah!
Whoo!

06:49.722 --> 06:51.623
I'm ready
to go all the way

06:51.691 --> 06:53.825
and to become head chef
at BLT Steak.

06:53.893 --> 06:58.096
After a whirlwind
tour of New York City,

06:58.163 --> 07:00.599
the chefs return
reinvigorated.

07:00.666 --> 07:02.834
What's this?
What's this? What's this?

07:02.902 --> 07:04.536
And ready to take
on their next challenge.

07:04.604 --> 07:05.570
Look at you all.

07:05.638 --> 07:07.038
Welcome back.

07:07.106 --> 07:08.339
Hey. Thank you, chef.
Thank you, chef.

07:08.407 --> 07:10.275
So did you get inspired?

07:10.342 --> 07:11.376
Yes, chef!

07:11.443 --> 07:12.576
<i>Motivated?</i>

07:12.644 --> 07:13.644
Yes, chef!

07:13.712 --> 07:16.247
Hungry?
No, chef.

07:16.315 --> 07:17.648
Jennifer.
Yes, chef?

07:17.716 --> 07:19.250
Did you enjoy it?
It was amazing.

07:19.318 --> 07:20.651
<i>It reminded me</i>
<i>why I'm here.</i>

07:20.719 --> 07:21.685
Good!

07:21.753 --> 07:23.621
<i>You all had opportunity</i>

07:23.688 --> 07:25.256
<i>to taste</i>
<i>some of the finest cuisines</i>

07:25.324 --> 07:25.990
from anywhere
in the world.

07:26.058 --> 07:26.991
<i>Which brings me</i>

07:27.059 --> 07:28.359
to your next challenge.

07:28.427 --> 07:30.962
<i>Today, I want to see</i>

07:31.030 --> 07:32.297
<i>how creative</i>
<i>you can all be</i>

07:32.364 --> 07:34.065
with ethnic cuisine.

07:34.133 --> 07:36.401
<i>I hope, in New York,</i>

07:36.468 --> 07:38.069
you picked up some tips.

07:38.137 --> 07:39.570
What? Are you serious?

07:39.638 --> 07:41.472
We tried
seven different cuisines,

07:41.540 --> 07:44.308
t t the problem is,
I was just not paying attention.

07:44.375 --> 07:46.410
Excited?  Yes, chef!

07:46.478 --> 07:47.912
Good, 'cause right now,
each and every one of you

07:47.979 --> 07:49.012
is about to gamble

07:49.080 --> 07:50.247
your future
in Hell's Kitchen.

07:50.315 --> 07:52.316
Ohh, my goodness.

07:52.383 --> 07:53.484
Eh?

07:54.786 --> 07:55.920
That's right.

07:55.987 --> 07:56.954
This is
crazy, dude.

07:57.021 --> 07:58.322
As far as gambling,

07:58.389 --> 07:59.890
I've never been real lucky.

07:59.958 --> 08:00.958
Listen carefully.
One at a time,

08:01.025 --> 08:01.992
each chef will come forward.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.761
<i>After you pull the handle,</i>

08:03.829 --> 08:05.329
the five slots you land on

08:05.396 --> 08:06.564
<i>will determine</i>
<i>the ingredients.</i>

08:06.631 --> 08:08.766
<i>What protein, what starch,</i>

08:08.834 --> 08:10.968
what fruit and two vegetable

08:11.035 --> 08:12.503
<i>you'll be cooking with.</i> 
<i>Also,</i>

08:12.571 --> 08:13.736
a coin will come out.

08:13.804 --> 08:15.672
<i>The coin determines</i>

08:15.739 --> 08:16.773
the type of cuisine.

08:16.841 --> 08:18.307
<i>Who's feeling lucky?</i>

08:18.375 --> 08:19.509
<i>Natalie.</i>

08:19.577 --> 08:20.743
Step forward.

08:20.811 --> 08:21.811
Get 'em, girl.

08:21.879 --> 08:22.846
<i>Come on, nat.</i>

08:22.913 --> 08:24.380
Okay, pull the handle.

08:26.283 --> 08:27.484
Pork!
Pork!

08:27.551 --> 08:29.151
With corn! Corn!

08:29.219 --> 08:30.720
Potatoes.

08:30.788 --> 08:31.588
<i>Kumquats.</i>

08:31.655 --> 08:32.589
Ooh.

08:32.655 --> 08:33.756
<i>And green beans.</i>

08:33.823 --> 08:34.823
<i>And the ethnic cuisine is...</i>

08:34.892 --> 08:36.224
Jamaican!

08:36.292 --> 08:37.424
Jamaican. Ohh.

08:37.494 --> 08:38.594
Wow.

08:38.660 --> 08:40.828
I had some
tricky ingredients.

08:40.897 --> 08:41.929
Basically, good luck.

08:41.998 --> 08:43.398
I was just hoping

08:43.466 --> 08:44.566
that I could
pull something together.

08:44.634 --> 08:46.067
Okay, next up, Jennifer.

08:46.135 --> 08:47.536
Great.
<i>Let's go.</i>

08:47.604 --> 08:49.404
I feel lucky today.

08:49.472 --> 08:50.672
I'm ready to pull the handle
and see what I get.

08:50.740 --> 08:52.107
What protein
you hoping for?

08:52.174 --> 08:53.609
Anything but salmon.
Ethnic cuisine?

08:53.676 --> 08:55.076
I would love Greek.
Off you go.

08:55.144 --> 08:56.879
Come stand over.

08:56.946 --> 08:58.279
Oh, my God.

08:58.347 --> 09:00.649
So protein first is...
Salmon!

09:00.717 --> 09:02.818
- Me!
- Wow, well done!

09:02.886 --> 09:04.853
I got salmon,
which I wasn't happy about.

09:04.921 --> 09:06.388
But my ingredients all,
like, work together,

09:06.455 --> 09:08.189
as long as I get Greek.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.025
Ethnic cuisine is...

09:10.092 --> 09:11.259
<i>I got Greek.</i>

09:11.327 --> 09:12.693
Greek! Well...

09:13.862 --> 09:15.930
<i>Opa!</i>

09:15.998 --> 09:18.599
It's now will's
turn to gamble for ingredients.

09:18.667 --> 09:19.700
<i>Scallop, wow.</i> 
<i>Scallop.</i>

09:19.768 --> 09:21.736
<i>Mango and...Asparagus.</i>

09:21.803 --> 09:23.004
Type of cuisine is...

09:23.072 --> 09:24.672
<i>Italian.</i> 
Italian!

09:24.740 --> 09:26.241
I come from
an Italian background.

09:26.308 --> 09:27.509
Thank God.

09:27.576 --> 09:29.010
Up next, Elizabeth.

09:29.078 --> 09:30.512
Okay, off you go.

09:30.579 --> 09:33.281
I'm definitely
very familiar with Chinese.

09:33.349 --> 09:34.982
I currently work
in an Asian restaurant.

09:35.051 --> 09:36.217
<i>Type of cuisine is...</i>

09:36.285 --> 09:37.618
Oh, I got Mexican.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.621
<i>Oh damn.</i>

09:41.689 --> 09:43.723
Elizabeth got Mexican,
and I was totally jealous.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.259
I wanted Mexican so bad.

09:45.326 --> 09:46.460
<i>Okay, good.</i> 
<i>Type of cuisine is...</i>

09:46.528 --> 09:47.694
I hope I don't get Indian.

09:47.762 --> 09:48.929
I hope I don't
get Indian.

09:48.996 --> 09:50.064
I hope I don't get Indian.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.765
I got Indian.

09:51.832 --> 09:53.267
Ooh hoo hoo, God.

09:53.334 --> 09:54.601
Agh!

09:54.669 --> 09:56.636
Elise will be cooking with...

09:56.704 --> 09:58.805
<i>Ahi tuna.</i> 
<i>Carrots.</i>

09:58.873 --> 10:00.140
Beans?
Beans. Wow.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.442
I don't even like beans.

10:01.509 --> 10:03.477
Kumquats, I never seen
before today.

10:03.545 --> 10:05.045
Type of
ethnic cuisine is...

10:05.113 --> 10:06.346
Chinese.

10:06.414 --> 10:08.782
I have no Chinese food
experience, none.

10:08.849 --> 10:10.784
The wheels of
fortune spin next for Paul.

10:10.851 --> 10:12.385
<i>Filet with...</i>

10:12.453 --> 10:13.786
Eggplant. Eggplant.
I'm good with that.

10:13.853 --> 10:14.753
<i>Polenta.</i>

10:14.821 --> 10:16.089
Grapefruit.
Grapefruit.

10:16.156 --> 10:16.989
<i>And kale.</i> 
<i>Ethnic cuisine...</i>

10:17.057 --> 10:18.624
French.
Come on!

10:18.692 --> 10:20.759
Yeah, I hit the jackpot,
I think.

10:20.827 --> 10:22.528
<i>Come on, that is a jackpot.</i>

10:22.596 --> 10:23.996
<i>Well done.</i> 
<i>So you've all got</i>

10:24.064 --> 10:24.997
45 minutes.

10:25.065 --> 10:27.166
Your time starts from now.

10:27.234 --> 10:28.601
Off you go.
Good luck!

10:28.668 --> 10:30.303
Thank you, chef.
Let's do this.

10:30.330 --> 10:33.199
After the chefs'
inspirational culinary tour of New York,

10:33.307 --> 10:35.208
chef Ramsay has designed
this challenge

10:35.275 --> 10:37.410
to test their creativity
with ethnic foods.

10:37.478 --> 10:40.246
It's not French unless
it has butter and cream.

10:40.314 --> 10:42.348
Each chef
must prepare an entree

10:42.416 --> 10:44.449
in the style of the cuisine
featured on their coin,

10:44.517 --> 10:46.919
using the five ingredients
that they randomly earned

10:46.987 --> 10:48.153
playing slots.

10:48.221 --> 10:49.554
What the heck is this?

10:49.623 --> 10:50.923
A carrot.
A yellow carrot.

10:50.991 --> 10:52.891
Really?
I'm not gonna lie.

10:52.959 --> 10:54.660
Today's the first day
I cooked something Chinese.

10:54.728 --> 10:56.561
Wow.
It's like, okay...

10:56.630 --> 10:58.130
Soy sauce?

10:58.197 --> 10:59.898
What happened
to the sicilian olives?

10:59.966 --> 11:01.466
The peppercorns?
<i>15 minutes gone.</i>

11:01.534 --> 11:02.935
30 minutes to go.

11:03.003 --> 11:04.302
Yes, chef!

11:04.370 --> 11:06.071
When I think Jamaican,
I think jerk.

11:06.139 --> 11:07.405
And jerk is spicy.

11:07.473 --> 11:09.008
So that's
what I'm gonna do.

11:09.075 --> 11:10.509
Bless you. Bless you.

11:10.576 --> 11:12.611
You all right, girl?
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:12.679 --> 11:14.379
It's all these peppers
over here.

11:14.447 --> 11:15.280
Any more? I think I'm good.

11:15.348 --> 11:16.280
All right.

11:17.349 --> 11:18.349
Last five minutes.

11:18.416 --> 11:19.751
Holy.

11:19.818 --> 11:21.585
That's right,
holy.

11:21.654 --> 11:23.087
<i>Time to go.</i> 
We gotta move.

11:23.155 --> 11:25.089
May the spirit
of Santo be with me.

11:25.157 --> 11:26.624
I'm kind of
freaking out right now.

11:26.692 --> 11:27.892
I got plates
for everybody.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.527
Here's your plate.
I have a bowl.

11:29.594 --> 11:31.162
Let's go.
Start plating.

11:31.229 --> 11:31.963
Ohh...
<i>Let's go.</i>

11:33.866 --> 11:35.667
Five...Four...

11:35.734 --> 11:36.768
<i>Three...</i>

11:36.835 --> 11:38.335
<i>Two...One.</i>

11:38.403 --> 11:40.004
<i>And serve!</i>

11:41.707 --> 11:43.207
Listen carefully.

11:43.275 --> 11:44.608
As you know, I'm looking
for someone to emerge.

11:44.677 --> 11:46.377
A leader.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.679
So today,
I'm gonna determine

11:48.746 --> 11:50.581
<i>the winner of this challenge</i>

11:50.649 --> 11:52.700
in a completely
different way.

11:54.352 --> 11:55.352
That's right.

11:55.365 --> 11:56.525
<i>Never done this before.</i>

11:57.722 --> 11:59.244
What the hell is going on?

12:07.789 --> 12:09.689
The contestants
have completed their dishes

12:09.756 --> 12:11.591
for the ethnic cuisine
challenge.

12:11.658 --> 12:13.158
<i>And serve!</i>

12:13.226 --> 12:14.093
And anxiously await judgment.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.829
But first, chef Ramsay
has an announcement.

12:16.897 --> 12:19.431
As you know, I'm looking for
someone to emerge... a leader!

12:19.500 --> 12:21.400
<i>So today,</i>
<i>I'm gonna determine</i>

12:21.468 --> 12:23.335
<i>the winner of this challenge</i>

12:23.403 --> 12:25.538
<i>in a completely</i>
<i>different way.</i>

12:28.196 --> 12:29.993
<i>King of the hill!</i>

12:30.292 --> 12:32.794
<i>That's right, I'm gonna</i>
<i>taste the dishes individually.</i>

12:32.980 --> 12:34.480
The person with
the best dish

12:34.548 --> 12:36.582
wins the challenge
for their team.

12:36.650 --> 12:37.650
<i>Got it?</i>

12:37.718 --> 12:39.084
Yes, chef!

12:39.152 --> 12:40.987
It's time for everyone
to start realizing

12:41.054 --> 12:43.122
that we're a group,
but we're also individuals.

12:43.189 --> 12:44.356
And everyone needs
to start to shine.

12:44.424 --> 12:46.025
Tommy, let's go.

12:46.092 --> 12:48.060
<i>Go to it.</i> 
<i>Come on, Tommy.</i>

12:48.128 --> 12:49.294
Up first is Tommy...

12:49.362 --> 12:51.030
Puttin' me on the spot.

12:51.097 --> 12:52.231
With his
attempt at Indian cuisine.

12:52.298 --> 12:54.766
Let's do it.

12:54.834 --> 12:55.800
<i>So...</i>

12:55.868 --> 12:56.935
What is it?

12:57.003 --> 12:58.037
<i>Okay, I did chicken</i>

12:58.104 --> 12:59.104
<i>roasted in the oven.</i>

12:59.172 --> 13:00.139
<i>What I was going for was</i>

13:00.206 --> 13:01.573
like a mango curry.

13:01.641 --> 13:03.142
Let's hope it tastes
more Indian

13:03.209 --> 13:04.043
<i>than it looks.</i>

13:07.013 --> 13:08.547
What do you think
of the sauce?

13:08.614 --> 13:09.415
It actually
tastes delicious.

13:09.482 --> 13:10.882
<i>Nice heat</i>

13:10.950 --> 13:12.518
and a combination
of spices.

13:12.585 --> 13:13.685
Got you there.
<i>It tastes Indian.</i>

13:13.753 --> 13:14.853
Congratulations.
Sit in the chair.

13:14.921 --> 13:15.754
Good job, Tommy!

13:17.123 --> 13:18.723
Elizabeth, let's go.

13:18.791 --> 13:21.927
Chef said that this is gonna be
king of the hill.

13:21.994 --> 13:24.529
But this is definitely
gonna be queen of the hill,

13:24.597 --> 13:26.464
'cause my dish is gonna win.

13:26.532 --> 13:27.432
This is...

13:27.499 --> 13:28.700
New York strip.

13:28.768 --> 13:30.902
I garnished it with
diced chorizo.

13:30.970 --> 13:33.038
<i>And cotija cheese</i>
<i>on top.</i>

13:33.105 --> 13:34.205
<i>Okay.</i>

13:34.273 --> 13:36.240
<i>Steak slightly</i>
<i>overcooked.</i>

13:36.308 --> 13:38.043
<i>But it tastes a lot</i>
<i>better than it looks.</i>

13:38.110 --> 13:39.310
<i>And it tastes Mexican.</i>

13:39.378 --> 13:40.411
Good job.
Thank you.

13:40.479 --> 13:41.813
<i>My big question is...</i>

13:41.881 --> 13:42.881
Is your dish

13:42.949 --> 13:44.315
<i>more accomplished</i>

13:44.383 --> 13:46.585
than Tommy's
Indian-inspired dish?

13:46.652 --> 13:47.686
<i>And the answer is...</i>

13:49.622 --> 13:50.822
Congratulations, Elizabeth.

13:50.890 --> 13:52.356
<i>Tommy, get off that chair.</i>

13:52.424 --> 13:53.857
Good job, Liz.
<i>Really good.</i>

13:53.925 --> 13:55.059
<i>Good job.</i> 
Thank you, chef.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.526
That's my chair.

13:56.595 --> 13:58.929
Tommy was just keeping it
warm for me.

13:58.997 --> 13:59.964
Natalie, talk to me.

14:00.031 --> 14:01.599
Um, I had pork.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.400
<i>And the sauce</i>
<i>is a guava paste.</i>

14:03.468 --> 14:05.368
<i>Habanero coconut.</i>

14:05.436 --> 14:07.705
Taste the spices in there.

14:11.242 --> 14:12.843
<i>God, I mean, it's almost</i>
<i>bringing tears to my eyes.</i>

14:12.911 --> 14:13.877
Is that hot for you?

14:13.945 --> 14:15.245
I actually like it.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.081
I tried
to kind of sweeten it out.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.016
That's way gone.
<i>Okay.</i>

14:19.084 --> 14:20.283
<i>You definitely will not</i>
<i>be replacing Elizabeth.</i>

14:20.351 --> 14:21.685
Okay.

14:21.753 --> 14:22.853
<i>Back in line</i>
<i>with your dish.</i>

14:22.921 --> 14:23.754
It's all good, Natalie.

14:23.822 --> 14:24.855
<i>Elizabeth, you're safe.</i>

14:24.923 --> 14:26.689
<i>Too much, Natalie.</i>

14:26.757 --> 14:28.625
<i>It's all good, girl.</i> 
I thought my dish was good.

14:28.692 --> 14:30.227
I thought the spices
were perfect.

14:31.862 --> 14:33.863
Paul, let's go.

14:33.931 --> 14:35.932
With Natalie's
dish too hot to handle,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.101
it's up to Paul's
French-inspired filet

14:38.169 --> 14:41.238
to regain the culinary throne
for the Blue Team.

14:41.305 --> 14:42.405
Meat's cooked perfectly.

14:42.473 --> 14:43.840
<i>I love the idea behind</i>

14:43.907 --> 14:46.042
the grapefruit
in the hollandaise.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.211
And that is French cuisine
and on a plate.

14:48.279 --> 14:50.213
<i>It's delicious.</i> 
Thank you, chef.

14:50.281 --> 14:51.381
And that's
exactly what happens

14:51.449 --> 14:52.882
as he unseats
Elizabeth.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.751
Well done, Pauly.
Good job, Pauly.

14:54.818 --> 14:56.586
Okay, Elise, let's go.

14:56.654 --> 14:58.420
And now, Elise
is ready to impress

14:58.488 --> 15:00.589
with her take on Chinese.

15:00.658 --> 15:03.059
<i>It's ahi tuna seasoned with</i>

15:03.127 --> 15:04.326
soy sauce.

15:04.394 --> 15:06.062
Yeah, I like it.
It's nice.

15:06.130 --> 15:07.496
<i>Tuna's cooked perfectly.</i> 
Thank you, chef.

15:07.564 --> 15:08.665
<i>Take a seat.</i> 
<i>Congratulations.</i>

15:08.732 --> 15:09.899
Good job.
Thank you, chef.

15:09.967 --> 15:11.433
And thus begins the reign

15:11.501 --> 15:13.102
of queen Elise.

15:13.170 --> 15:14.937
I'm the queen of the hill,

15:15.005 --> 15:17.106
and my dish
was better than yours.

15:18.776 --> 15:21.077
With the red
team holding court,

15:21.145 --> 15:22.578
will storms the castle

15:22.646 --> 15:24.814
with his take
on Italian cuisine.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.149
What is that?

15:26.216 --> 15:27.216
I did prosciutto-wrapped
scallops

15:27.284 --> 15:28.317
<i>seared in olive oil</i>

15:28.385 --> 15:29.718
and rendered prosciutto fat.

15:29.786 --> 15:31.486
Delicious.
Great, yeah.

15:31.554 --> 15:33.254
Will...
Yes, chef?

15:33.322 --> 15:35.356
You're the king.
Great job.

15:35.424 --> 15:37.525
- Congratulations. Good job.
- Good job, will.

15:37.593 --> 15:39.161
Definitely the best dish
I've tasted so far.

15:39.228 --> 15:40.295
<i>If the competition</i>
<i>ended right now,</i>

15:40.362 --> 15:41.229
he'd win it
for the Blue Team.

15:41.297 --> 15:42.130
But we have one more!

15:42.198 --> 15:43.098
<i>Jennifer, let's go.</i>

15:43.166 --> 15:44.566
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

15:44.633 --> 15:46.802
Oh, my God, it's coming down
to me and will.

15:46.869 --> 15:48.369
<i>Come on, Jennifer.</i>

15:48.437 --> 15:50.738
New York and Boston,
fightin' to the end.

15:50.806 --> 15:52.139
That's what
I'm excited about.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.208
<i>Tell me, what is it?</i>

15:53.275 --> 15:54.342
<i>Pan-seared salmon</i>

15:54.410 --> 15:57.111
<i>with olives, feta cheese.</i>

15:57.179 --> 15:58.346
Salmon's cooked perfectly.

15:58.414 --> 15:59.314
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

15:59.381 --> 16:00.981
Mmm. Wow.

16:01.049 --> 16:02.584
<i>It's delicious.</i> 
Thank you, chef.

16:02.651 --> 16:03.618
It's a very tough call,
this one.

16:03.686 --> 16:05.086
<i>Two very good dishes.</i>

16:05.153 --> 16:06.954
Tough.
Very tough.

16:07.022 --> 16:08.723
<i>Uh...Okay.</i> 
<i>The king of the hill.</i>

16:08.790 --> 16:11.226
And winning it
for their team

16:11.293 --> 16:12.126
is...

16:14.096 --> 16:15.830
- Jennifer!
- Oh,!

16:15.897 --> 16:17.164
<i>Good job.</i> 
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

16:17.233 --> 16:18.866
<i>Yeah, good job.</i>

16:20.702 --> 16:22.536
Oh, my God, I won!

16:22.604 --> 16:24.071
I won the challenge.

16:24.139 --> 16:25.672
It's like holy ,
I just beat will.

16:25.741 --> 16:26.907
Good job, girl.

16:26.975 --> 16:29.276
Boston beat out
New York today.

16:29.344 --> 16:30.845
<i>Red Team, clearly you...</i>

16:30.912 --> 16:31.712
You sourced
huge inspiration

16:31.780 --> 16:33.013
from your trip in New York.

16:33.081 --> 16:36.583
Well done.
Okay, thanks to Jennifer.

16:36.651 --> 16:38.418
Since we're in Los Angeles,

16:38.486 --> 16:40.420
what better place
to have great fun

16:40.488 --> 16:41.956
than at the beach?

16:42.023 --> 16:44.258
Beach? Oh, my God!

16:44.325 --> 16:45.860
<i>That's right.</i> 
<i>You're hitting the beach.</i>

16:45.927 --> 16:47.561
The beach!
The beach!

16:47.629 --> 16:49.096
Do you want to know
what's happening at the beach?

16:49.164 --> 16:50.297
Yes.
Yes.

16:50.365 --> 16:52.233
I'm not gonna tell you.
It's a surprise.

16:52.300 --> 16:55.034
<i>What I will tell you is</i>
<i>you are gonna love it.</i>

16:55.102 --> 16:56.336
<i>Well done.</i> 
<i>Good job.</i>

16:56.404 --> 16:57.771
Thank you, chef.

16:57.838 --> 16:59.172
Blue Team!

16:59.240 --> 17:01.074
<i>Tonight,</i>
<i>Hell's Kitchen is open.</i>

17:01.142 --> 17:03.410
Which means you'll be
prepping both kitchens

17:03.478 --> 17:04.911
ahead of tonight's service.

17:07.815 --> 17:11.151
It's gonna be a long,
hard, tedious afternoon.

17:11.218 --> 17:12.419
Yes, chef.

17:12.487 --> 17:14.320
Red Team,
go get into something

17:14.388 --> 17:15.555
<i>a little bit more comfortable</i>
<i>for a day on the beach.</i>

17:15.623 --> 17:16.323
Thank you, chef.

17:16.391 --> 17:17.691
Have a great time.

17:17.759 --> 17:18.925
Beach, beach!
Beach, beach, beach.

17:18.992 --> 17:20.093
Beach, beach, beach, beach.

17:20.161 --> 17:21.895
Oh, I have to shave.

17:21.962 --> 17:23.430
<i>Blue Team...</i>

17:23.498 --> 17:24.931
Start off
by cleaning out the kitchen.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.299
Let's go.
Hurry up.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.935
This is the fourth time
in the game row

17:30.003 --> 17:32.004
we gotta sit here and prep up
both  kitchens.

17:32.071 --> 17:33.439
That sucks.

17:35.275 --> 17:37.443
Red Team...
Shake that ass.

17:39.112 --> 17:40.379
All right,
start it off, Liz.

17:40.447 --> 17:41.814
Ladies, shake that ass.

17:41.881 --> 17:42.815
Whoo!

17:42.882 --> 17:44.517
<i>Beach! See ya!</i>

17:44.584 --> 17:47.085
Bye, guys.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.588
That's what
I'm talkin' 'bout!

17:49.656 --> 17:51.324
Ghetto goes to the beach.

17:51.391 --> 17:52.858
That's hot!

17:52.926 --> 17:55.328
I have never seen anything
like this before in my life.

17:55.395 --> 17:56.562
Let's go!

17:56.630 --> 17:58.430
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

17:58.497 --> 18:00.332
We're gonna get
sand in our bots.

18:00.399 --> 18:01.899
Crotches.

18:06.472 --> 18:07.972
<i>Whoo!</i>

18:08.040 --> 18:09.073
<i>Are you serious?</i>

18:09.141 --> 18:11.042
Wah, wah.

18:12.578 --> 18:13.478
Are you ready to do this?

18:13.546 --> 18:14.946
Oh, my God.

18:15.013 --> 18:16.648
It's James!

18:16.716 --> 18:18.717
Welcome!

18:18.784 --> 18:20.051
Congratulations.

18:20.118 --> 18:21.786
You have won zorbing!

18:23.322 --> 18:25.288
What the heck is zorbing?

18:26.624 --> 18:27.725
Who wants to go first.

18:27.792 --> 18:29.326
Not me.

18:29.394 --> 18:31.027
Like, since no
one else wants to do it,

18:31.095 --> 18:32.796
I'm a zorb right now.

18:32.864 --> 18:34.030
Agh!

18:34.098 --> 18:36.233
Lay down and make sure
you hold those straps.

18:36.300 --> 18:37.468
Don't let go,

18:37.535 --> 18:39.035
<i>whatever you do.</i>

18:39.103 --> 18:40.738
This is bizarre.

18:40.805 --> 18:42.072
Are we really
pushing her?

18:42.139 --> 18:43.273
Push!
<i>Whoo!</i>

18:43.341 --> 18:45.208
Stop!

18:46.878 --> 18:47.978
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.080
Oh, no!

18:53.183 --> 18:54.417
What the?

18:54.485 --> 18:56.252
Oh, my God, you guys!

18:56.319 --> 18:58.187
You have to try this!

18:59.690 --> 19:01.090
Ohh ho!

19:04.395 --> 19:05.728
"Oh! Uhh! Uhh!"

19:07.097 --> 19:08.865
The funnest part
is pushing, by far!

19:08.932 --> 19:10.666
The more I heard her scream,

19:10.734 --> 19:12.201
the more I pushed it
with all my might.

19:16.306 --> 19:18.307
They were kind of like
thrilling screams.

19:18.375 --> 19:19.809
Um, I kind of
had fun with it.

19:19.877 --> 19:22.545
Ohh ho!

19:24.114 --> 19:26.282
Just
do it already!

19:26.349 --> 19:28.017
And push!
Oh, my God!

19:28.084 --> 19:30.019
Aah!

19:30.086 --> 19:31.653
My God!

19:31.721 --> 19:32.821
Aah!

19:36.126 --> 19:37.526
Push!

19:37.593 --> 19:39.261
No!

19:43.633 --> 19:45.000
Should I actually
mince that and...

19:45.068 --> 19:46.035
<i>Put it out?</i>

19:47.304 --> 19:48.637
Dude, that's
a dry ingredient.

19:51.374 --> 19:52.908
I worry about Tommy
all the time.

19:55.045 --> 19:56.145
He's dumb.

19:56.212 --> 19:57.446
<i>Oh, you want...</i> 
<i>Really want</i>

19:57.513 --> 19:59.613
to lose some fingers
right now?

19:59.681 --> 20:00.848
Don't...

20:00.916 --> 20:03.117
And you can't fix dumb.

20:03.185 --> 20:04.718
My wedgie is like

20:04.786 --> 20:06.354
the world's worst
wedgie right now.

20:07.756 --> 20:08.957
They're back.

20:10.359 --> 20:11.459
We went
in a plastic bubble.

20:11.526 --> 20:12.827
We went in a bubble,

20:12.894 --> 20:14.095
<i>and they pushed it,</i>
<i>and we spun.</i>

20:14.163 --> 20:15.663
And then we went
on the beach.

20:16.332 --> 20:17.966
I'm in a grumpy-ass mood.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.300
We had a good time.

20:19.368 --> 20:20.335
I hate life.

20:22.537 --> 20:25.539
It's just 30
minutes before dinner service,

20:25.607 --> 20:28.742
and the Blue Team is still
prepping both kitchens.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.244
Elise?
Yes.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.479
I'm wrapping your
Wellington for you.

20:31.546 --> 20:32.813
<i>No problem.</i>

20:32.881 --> 20:33.681
But, uh, I'm not
scoring them now.

20:33.748 --> 20:34.615
Cool.

20:34.683 --> 20:36.084
Let's go, ladies, yeah?
Yep.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.685
<i>Tasting spoons.</i>

20:37.752 --> 20:39.787
The service of your life.

20:39.855 --> 20:41.755
Yes, chef.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.791
Tommy prepped
the Wellingtons

20:43.859 --> 20:44.859
but didn't score them.

20:44.926 --> 20:45.893
Like, whatever.

20:45.961 --> 20:47.327
I'll do it myself.

20:47.395 --> 20:48.729
I don't know why
he did this like this.

20:48.797 --> 20:50.464
It's so stupid.

20:50.532 --> 20:52.967
I'm not liking how
these Wellingtons are prepped.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.802
James!
Yes, chef?

20:54.870 --> 20:55.970
Let's go.
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.

20:56.037 --> 20:56.904
Yes, chef.

21:08.616 --> 21:11.918
As usual, it's full
house for tonight's dinner service.

21:11.986 --> 21:13.220
This is about pride, boys.

21:13.287 --> 21:14.554
Hell, yeah.

21:14.622 --> 21:16.223
With only three chefs

21:16.290 --> 21:18.291
left in the red kitchen
and four in the blue,

21:18.359 --> 21:21.161
each will be under
heavy scubbing tonight.

21:21.229 --> 21:22.262
<i>Mornin', chef..</i>

21:22.363 --> 21:23.530
Let's go, ladies, yes?

21:23.564 --> 21:24.564
Yes, chef.

21:24.598 --> 21:25.565
You've been to New York.

21:25.633 --> 21:26.666
You've been inspired.

21:26.734 --> 21:28.335
<i>You've seen the prize.</i>

21:28.403 --> 21:30.103
Tonight is
comeback night, right?

21:30.171 --> 21:31.538
Yes, chef. Here we go.

21:31.605 --> 21:32.539
Three scallops,
one risotto.

21:32.606 --> 21:33.640
Yes, chef!

21:33.707 --> 21:34.574
Thank you.
Let's go.

21:34.642 --> 21:35.842
Six minutes, Elizabeth.

21:35.910 --> 21:37.344
Six minutes, heard.

21:37.412 --> 21:38.945
I am more motivated now
than I have been

21:39.013 --> 21:40.514
during this whole
competition.

21:40.581 --> 21:42.448
I just have to show chef

21:42.516 --> 21:43.583
that I, Elizabeth,

21:43.651 --> 21:45.985
can be an executive chef.

21:46.053 --> 21:48.320
2 1/2 minutes, Elizabeth.

21:48.388 --> 21:50.056
Elizabeth?

21:50.123 --> 21:51.891
While Elizabeth
dreams of a bright future

21:51.959 --> 21:53.526
at BLT Steak in New York...

21:53.594 --> 21:54.928
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

21:54.995 --> 21:57.196
Over in the blue kitchen...

21:57.264 --> 21:58.765
 <i>Tell me when</i>
<i>to drop scallops, Paul.</i>

21:58.832 --> 21:59.666
Natalie is working hard

21:59.733 --> 22:00.934
to make that dream a reality.

22:01.001 --> 22:02.101
Drop scallops!
<i>Heard.</i>

22:02.169 --> 22:04.037
In the last couple services,

22:04.104 --> 22:05.838
I've been struggling
in the kitchen.

22:05.906 --> 22:08.041
And I think chef Ramsay
thinks that I'm green.

22:08.108 --> 22:09.275
Two scallops.

22:09.342 --> 22:10.509
<i>Two risotto.</i> 
<i>Work it, yes?</i>

22:10.578 --> 22:11.778
Yes, chef!

22:11.845 --> 22:13.684
Going to the pass
in ten seconds, Paul!

22:13.763 --> 22:14.865
Walking up, two scallops.

22:14.913 --> 22:16.310
<i>Let's go!</i> 
<i>I wanna hear you, Natalie.</i>

22:16.357 --> 22:17.214
Yes, chef.

22:17.282 --> 22:20.467
So I just have to get
that "wow" dinner service in.

22:20.650 --> 22:22.184
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.518
Natalie!

22:25.667 --> 22:26.501
Natalie!

22:34.361 --> 22:36.596
It's just 15
minutes into dinner service...

22:36.663 --> 22:38.064
I've got scallops done!

22:38.132 --> 22:39.866
And Natalie is anxious

22:39.934 --> 22:41.968
to impress chef Ramsay
with her first appetizers.

22:42.652 --> 22:43.585
Natalie!

22:45.239 --> 22:46.472
Natalie!

22:46.540 --> 22:47.473
<i>Come here!</i>

22:47.541 --> 22:49.075
All of you, come here!

22:49.143 --> 22:50.543
Look at that!

22:50.611 --> 22:52.378
You've got them cooked
one side.

22:52.446 --> 22:53.812
And what's that?

22:53.880 --> 22:55.180
They're not even seared!

22:55.249 --> 22:57.283
Completely raw scallop.

22:57.351 --> 22:59.218
I've been caught a few times
with some mistakes here.

22:59.286 --> 23:00.586
I'm not gonna tell you
I'm perfect.

23:00.654 --> 23:01.754
But that's
a major mistake.

23:01.821 --> 23:03.456
I'll refire right now.
Hurry up!

23:03.523 --> 23:04.624
Get a grip, Natalie.

23:04.691 --> 23:05.824
Yes, chef!

23:05.892 --> 23:07.326
As Natalie races

23:07.394 --> 23:09.094
to refire
her first appetizers,

23:09.162 --> 23:10.596
in the red kitchen...

23:10.664 --> 23:11.930
Service.
Nice sear on the scallops.

23:11.998 --> 23:13.266
Thank you, chef.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.334
I need two more
scallops, please.

23:15.402 --> 23:16.769
Elizabeth attempts
to keep the momentum going

23:16.836 --> 23:18.638
with her next order
of appetizers.

23:18.705 --> 23:20.139
Hold on, wait.
Do we...

23:20.206 --> 23:22.541
Jen, I need
another scallop down?

23:22.609 --> 23:24.342
Elizabeth, listen.
Yes.

23:24.410 --> 23:25.410
How long?
<i>Um...</i>

23:25.478 --> 23:26.745
<i>Scallops!</i>

23:26.813 --> 23:28.413
Elizabeth, talk!
<i>Three minutes, chef!</i>

23:28.481 --> 23:29.681
Come on, come on, come on!

23:29.749 --> 23:31.083
<i>We're getting slower.</i>

23:31.151 --> 23:33.618
<i>Elizabeth...</i>

23:33.686 --> 23:34.719
Help her, Elise!

23:34.788 --> 23:36.855
Yes, chef!
Jump in!

23:36.923 --> 23:38.690
<i>I know it's hard</i>
<i>for you to be</i>

23:38.758 --> 23:39.925
<i>encouraged to help somebody.</i> 
No, chef!

23:39.993 --> 23:41.160
- Jump in then!
<i>- Yes, chef!</i>

23:41.227 --> 23:42.360
Come on, girl.
Get it together.

23:42.428 --> 23:43.762
Little bit of oil.

23:43.830 --> 23:45.430
<i>Calm down.</i>

23:45.498 --> 23:46.965
Elizabeth,
she was so frazzled,

23:47.033 --> 23:48.466
it was making me
feel anxiety

23:48.534 --> 23:50.035
because of the way she was...

23:50.103 --> 23:51.436
Can you walk those
up for me?

23:51.504 --> 23:53.405
Yeah.
Let's go.

23:53.472 --> 23:54.973
Scallops.
Let's go.

23:55.041 --> 23:56.608
Excellent.
Service, please.

23:56.676 --> 23:58.109
With an assist from Elise,

23:58.177 --> 23:59.710
appetizers are once again

23:59.778 --> 24:01.478
making their way
out to the dining room.

24:01.546 --> 24:03.414
Seriously, the best scallops
I've ever tasted.

24:03.481 --> 24:04.849
Meanwhile, the blue kitchen

24:04.917 --> 24:05.749
is finishing off
appetizers.

24:05.818 --> 24:06.851
Scallop.

24:06.919 --> 24:07.952
Nice.

24:08.020 --> 24:09.653
Two risottos!
Service, please.

24:09.721 --> 24:11.555
And is now moving on to entrees.

24:11.623 --> 24:13.657
Two entree, one New York strip,
one Wellington.

24:13.725 --> 24:15.226
Yes, chef! <i>One minute!</i>

24:15.294 --> 24:16.360
<i>Tommy, you got 30 seconds,</i>
<i>homeboy.</i>

24:16.428 --> 24:18.129
All right.
<i>Tommy, put the onions</i>

24:18.197 --> 24:20.064
on a towel when they
come out of the  fryer.

24:20.132 --> 24:22.200
I know. Put 'em on the towel!

24:22.267 --> 24:23.901
Chef Scott
yells at me all the time.

24:23.969 --> 24:24.535
I think he thinks
I'm an idiot.

24:24.602 --> 24:25.903
I swear to God,

24:25.971 --> 24:27.305
I will  beat you
with that thing.

24:27.372 --> 24:28.272
But, uh,
I'm not gonna argue.

24:28.340 --> 24:29.206
You know,
it's his job

24:29.273 --> 24:30.173
to be an angry dictator.

24:31.809 --> 24:33.576
But, um, I know how
to cook an onion ring.

24:33.644 --> 24:35.645
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

24:35.713 --> 24:37.513
I've been
telling him all night

24:37.581 --> 24:38.882
to put it on towels soon as it
comes out of the fryer.

24:38.950 --> 24:39.883
<i>Just doesn't</i>
<i>want to do it.</i>

24:39.951 --> 24:41.784
Hey. Look.
Onion ring.

24:41.853 --> 24:44.321
Onion ring.

24:44.388 --> 24:47.357
Like a handful
of onion worms! Soggy.

24:47.424 --> 24:49.792
I'll fire another one
right now, chef.

24:49.861 --> 24:51.361
Despite Tommy's
troubles on the garnish station...

24:51.428 --> 24:52.829
Fish going to the pass!

24:52.897 --> 24:54.497
The Blue Team has

24:54.565 --> 24:55.631
a steady flow of food
leaving the kitchen.

24:57.969 --> 24:59.635
And an hour
into dinner service,

24:59.703 --> 25:02.137
both teams have fed
half their diners.

25:02.205 --> 25:03.439
Walking, New York strip!

25:03.507 --> 25:05.341
Service.

25:05.409 --> 25:06.642
This is so good.

25:06.710 --> 25:08.277
Two sea bass.

25:08.345 --> 25:10.179
I'm walking these two bass
up right now.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.381
And now it's up to Elizabeth

25:11.448 --> 25:13.483
to get the next order out.

25:13.550 --> 25:15.451
What happened to them?

25:15.519 --> 25:16.619
Elizabeth.

25:16.687 --> 25:17.854
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:17.921 --> 25:19.188
Come here, you.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.656
And you.

25:20.724 --> 25:21.691
Touch that there.

25:23.627 --> 25:25.094
Hold on there.
Look. Hold on, look.

25:25.161 --> 25:27.062
Hold on, look.
Look at that.

25:27.130 --> 25:28.731
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

25:28.799 --> 25:30.533
It's dry.

25:30.601 --> 25:32.101
Sorry.

25:32.168 --> 25:33.870
I felt, going
into dinner service,

25:33.937 --> 25:35.304
that I was gonna do
a really good job.

25:35.372 --> 25:36.671
But I'm going through
the motions of sucking.

25:36.739 --> 25:38.339
It's like this weird,
like, zombie person

25:38.408 --> 25:39.508
took over Elizabeth.

25:39.575 --> 25:40.776
Look at the state of you.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.511
<i>You're looking frazzled.</i>

25:42.578 --> 25:44.546
Two bass.
How long?

25:44.614 --> 25:46.047
Talk to him.

25:46.115 --> 25:47.516
Yes, I'll be four minutes
on this cod, chef.

25:47.583 --> 25:48.817
That's a bass in your hand.

25:48.885 --> 25:50.351
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, chef.

25:50.420 --> 25:51.753
I'm sorry, chef.
I'm sorry, chef.

25:51.821 --> 25:53.922
It's my fault, chef.
I'm very sorry, chef.

25:53.989 --> 25:55.757
I'm sorry, chef. <i>All right.
</i> <i>Come here, come here.</i>

25:55.825 --> 25:57.225
I'm sorry
that I'm freaking out.

25:57.293 --> 25:58.293
Hey, time out.
Time out.

25:58.360 --> 25:59.561
Oh, my God, Elizabeth.

25:59.629 --> 26:01.296
Like, I don't know
what you need to do.

26:01.363 --> 26:02.397
But you need
to  wake up.

26:02.465 --> 26:03.197
I'm sorry, chef.
Come here, madam.

26:03.265 --> 26:04.265
No, I'm fine right here.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.567
Look at me.
I'm fine right here.

26:05.635 --> 26:07.501
Talk to me.
Talk to me.

26:07.569 --> 26:08.769
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>the difference</i>

26:08.837 --> 26:10.370
<i>between a cod and a bass.</i>

26:10.439 --> 26:12.005
- I know my  job...
- I feel like I've been

26:12.073 --> 26:13.307
Up
too much tonight.

26:13.374 --> 26:14.542
It's like...
From the beginning.

26:14.609 --> 26:15.576
There is nothing wrong!

26:15.644 --> 26:17.411
We're just dragging
two bass!

26:17.479 --> 26:19.146
Okay, I will calm down

26:19.213 --> 26:20.714
and I will be smooth
for the rest of the service.

26:20.782 --> 26:22.082
I feel like I'm
losing my  mind!

26:22.150 --> 26:23.517
You're frazzled, yeah!

26:23.585 --> 26:25.152
<i>Big, deep breath</i>
<i>and come back.</i>

26:25.219 --> 26:27.287
It's like I'm in this,
like, alternate universe

26:27.355 --> 26:29.389
where, like, I can't get
anything done right at all.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.458
What do I have
working right now?

26:30.525 --> 26:31.759
Two bass.

26:31.827 --> 26:33.327
I see who's weakest now.

26:33.394 --> 26:35.028
You can't
crumble like that.

26:35.096 --> 26:36.296
If you make a mistake,
you gotta dust yourself off

26:36.364 --> 26:37.598
and fix it.

26:37.666 --> 26:38.998
Elizabeth is not good
at doing that.

26:39.066 --> 26:40.333
Elise, Wellington.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.233
Yes, chef!

26:43.838 --> 26:45.004
Oh, come on.

26:45.072 --> 26:46.372
What is that?

26:46.440 --> 26:48.407
Elise!

26:48.476 --> 26:51.143
All of you, come here!

26:51.211 --> 26:52.712
Who chewed that?

26:52.780 --> 26:54.981
That's what
you presented me.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.916
They're falling apart,
chef, I'm sorry.

26:56.984 --> 26:58.250
Off, Elise.

26:58.318 --> 27:01.153
<i>Start again!</i>

27:01.221 --> 27:02.221
Hey, you.

27:02.289 --> 27:03.556
Bring me that tray here.

27:05.459 --> 27:07.193
All of you, come here.
Yes, chef.

27:07.260 --> 27:09.461
She's complaining
they're falling apart.

27:09.529 --> 27:11.029
When you score pastry

27:11.097 --> 27:13.365
<i>that deep</i>
<i>with a sharp knife,</i>

27:13.432 --> 27:14.666
it falls apart.

27:14.734 --> 27:15.901
I'm not gonna
just sit here

27:15.969 --> 27:16.735
and take the blame
myself.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.303
I have to do something.

27:18.371 --> 27:19.805
How many of these
have you screwed?

27:19.873 --> 27:21.607
Chef, I did not score
the first tray.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.041
So who scored them, then?

27:23.109 --> 27:24.376
Tommy did.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.044
Now you're
blaming Tommy?

27:26.112 --> 27:27.713
I'm just saying that I
didn't score the first tray.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.649
Go over there and
tell him, then.

27:30.717 --> 27:31.750
I wanna see what
you say to him.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.218
Come here, you.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.820
The problem with Elise is

27:34.888 --> 27:36.154
Elise never admits
that she's wrong.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.288
She always blames
someone else.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.991
Tommy!
I'm telling the truth.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.058
<i>She's got something</i>
<i>to tell you.</i>

27:40.126 --> 27:41.526
That first tray
of Wellingtons

27:41.560 --> 27:42.627
that you basted
and scored,

27:42.694 --> 27:44.094
they all fell apart.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.763
Did you or did you not

27:45.831 --> 27:47.498
<i>score the first tray</i>
<i>of Wellingtons?</i>

27:56.780 --> 27:58.548
It's an hour and
a half into dinner service,

27:58.615 --> 28:00.450
and Elise's excuses...

28:00.518 --> 28:02.118
How many of these
have you screwed?

28:02.186 --> 28:03.920
Chef, I did not score
the first tray.

28:03.987 --> 28:05.321
So who scored them, then?

28:05.389 --> 28:06.989
Tommy did!

28:07.057 --> 28:08.791
Are wearing
thin on chef Ramsay.

28:08.859 --> 28:10.459
I wanna see
what you say to him.

28:10.527 --> 28:12.795
Come here, you.
I'm telling the truth.

28:12.863 --> 28:14.530
<i>Tommy! She's got something</i>
<i>to tell you.</i>

28:14.598 --> 28:16.165
That first tray
of Wellingtons that you

28:16.232 --> 28:17.132
basted and scored.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.768
They all fell apart.

28:18.835 --> 28:20.736
Did you or did you not

28:20.804 --> 28:23.172
<i>score the first tray</i>
<i>of Wellingtons?</i>

28:23.239 --> 28:24.540
No.

28:24.608 --> 28:25.908
Crazy.

28:25.976 --> 28:27.643
Don't come over bitchin' to me,

28:27.711 --> 28:29.178
coming into my kitchen,
when I'm working.

28:29.245 --> 28:30.212
I didn't even score
the damn things.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.948
Tommy stood
right over there

28:32.015 --> 28:33.449
in front of me
before service

28:33.516 --> 28:35.184
<i>and scored</i>
<i>and basted them!</i>

28:35.251 --> 28:36.819
No, I did not score them,
and I'm not lying.

28:36.887 --> 28:38.287
Play the replay.

28:38.354 --> 28:40.255
I'm wrapping
your Wellingtons for you.

28:40.323 --> 28:41.290
<i>No problem.
</i> But, uh, I'm not scoring them now.

28:41.357 --> 28:42.324
Cool.

28:42.392 --> 28:43.725
Hook me up to a polygraph.

28:43.793 --> 28:44.960
I'm telling you
the damn truth.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.295
If he scored 'em,

28:46.362 --> 28:47.429
why wouldn't he
have score ours?

28:47.497 --> 28:48.797
<i>Why didn't he score ours?</i>

28:48.864 --> 28:50.199
<i>No, he didn't slice</i>
<i>the Wellington.</i>

28:50.266 --> 28:51.800
That's some Booty-ass
, man.

28:51.867 --> 28:53.168
That girl coming over
trying to blame us

28:53.236 --> 28:54.736
'cause she can't cut
Wellingtons.

28:54.804 --> 28:56.305
Man up!
Own up to your mistakes!

28:56.372 --> 28:58.207
Pissed about
these Wellingtons.

28:58.274 --> 29:00.041
Elise!

29:00.110 --> 29:01.943
Do you know
the biggest problem with you?

29:02.011 --> 29:03.712
<i>Yourself.</i> 
<i>Who you gonna blame?</i>

29:03.779 --> 29:04.713
Carrie?

29:04.780 --> 29:05.780
Krupa?

29:05.848 --> 29:07.949
<i>Jamie?</i>

29:08.017 --> 29:09.751
While the red kitchen's issues

29:09.819 --> 29:11.420
have left their diners
without food,

29:11.488 --> 29:13.688
the Blue Team's diners
have their food.

29:13.756 --> 29:15.756
<i>Hi, how is everything?</i>

29:16.892 --> 29:19.327
It's like rubber!
Shall I?

29:19.394 --> 29:21.395
Although some
of them wish they didn't.

29:21.463 --> 29:22.764
Chef.
What's wrong?

29:22.832 --> 29:23.965
It's really dry.
Blue Team.

29:24.033 --> 29:25.266
Yeah.

29:26.769 --> 29:27.802
Blue Team!

29:27.870 --> 29:29.004
Yes, chef!

29:29.071 --> 29:30.238
<i>Bass returned.</i> 
<i>Dry.</i>

29:30.305 --> 29:32.173
I turn my back
for 30 seconds.

29:32.241 --> 29:33.274
<i>Hey, look, come here.</i> 
<i>Hey, madam.</i>

29:33.342 --> 29:34.208
<i>Yes, chef?</i>

29:34.276 --> 29:35.610
I'm not  around now.

29:35.678 --> 29:36.711
I know, chef.
Touch that.

29:36.779 --> 29:38.279
Yeah? Dry!

29:38.347 --> 29:39.447
Over-sear.

29:42.118 --> 29:44.152
I just... I don't know...
I don't know what I'm doing.

29:44.219 --> 29:45.920
Hey...You hit the nail
on the head there.

29:45.988 --> 29:46.788
You don't know
what you're doing.

29:46.856 --> 29:48.189
It's not good enough.

29:48.257 --> 29:49.824
I'm worried about
undercooking them,

29:49.892 --> 29:51.259
so I'm overcooking them.

29:51.326 --> 29:52.527
Chef!
Oh, no.

29:52.594 --> 29:54.061
They're rubbery.

29:54.129 --> 29:55.729
Oh, come on.
Table 23,

29:55.797 --> 29:56.664
table 21,
table 22.

29:56.731 --> 29:58.032
Every single table

29:58.099 --> 29:59.099
on the blue side
has complained

29:59.168 --> 30:00.168
about the sea bass tonight.

30:00.235 --> 30:02.670
Everybody
said it's dry.

30:02.737 --> 30:05.273
They're right.

30:05.340 --> 30:06.274
You can't cook fish.

30:06.341 --> 30:07.542
I can cook fish.

30:07.609 --> 30:08.809
So the customers
are lying?

30:08.877 --> 30:09.943
No, chef.

30:10.011 --> 30:11.512
<i>The day we, as chefs,</i>

30:11.580 --> 30:13.113
start blaming customers...

30:13.182 --> 30:15.216
No, chef, I'm not
blaming customers, no.

30:15.284 --> 30:18.219
It's frustrating
and embarrassing.

30:18.287 --> 30:20.288
'Cause I'm not an idiot.
I know how to cook fish.

30:20.355 --> 30:21.656
I really just don't know
what was going on.

30:21.723 --> 30:23.356
- I'm sorry, guys.
- None of that!

30:23.424 --> 30:25.125
<i>Get your head in the game,</i>

30:25.193 --> 30:27.360
keep pumpin' until the last
ticket's out.

30:27.428 --> 30:29.196
While Natalie's sea bass

30:29.263 --> 30:31.498
has left diners on the blue side
unsatisfied,

30:31.566 --> 30:33.300
the diners on the red side
are hoping

30:33.367 --> 30:35.936
Elizabeth's sea bass
will hit the spot.

30:36.004 --> 30:37.437
Two bass,
one New York strip!

30:37.505 --> 30:39.439
How long?
I need four minutes!

30:39.507 --> 30:41.241
You're not even
checking with me, yo.

30:41.309 --> 30:42.375
Jennifer, can you
get 'em together?

30:42.443 --> 30:44.044
Can you get them together?

30:44.112 --> 30:45.412
You need to drive
the ticket, Elise.

30:45.479 --> 30:46.346
<i>I said two minutes!</i>

30:46.414 --> 30:47.781
Two minutes, Liz!

30:47.849 --> 30:48.682
<i>My bass</i>
<i>is not gonna be done</i>

30:48.750 --> 30:49.750
in two minutes.

30:49.818 --> 30:50.784
Arrgh!

30:50.852 --> 30:52.052
I want to lead this group,

30:52.120 --> 30:53.153
but it's hard when you have

30:53.221 --> 30:54.787
Elise, who doesn't listen.

30:54.855 --> 30:56.089
You guys need to work together,
right now.

30:56.156 --> 30:57.389
She asked me
to hold it back!

30:57.457 --> 30:58.925
<i>Don't say it was...</i> 
<i>Say it was me!</i>

30:58.992 --> 31:01.060
And Elizabeth, that just
has no confidence.

31:01.128 --> 31:02.028
<i>How long, Elizabeth?</i>

31:02.096 --> 31:04.030
I need... I need...

31:04.098 --> 31:05.464
<i>Talk! How long!</i>

31:05.532 --> 31:06.733
<i>How long?</i>

31:06.800 --> 31:07.800
Everybody's gonna
get mad at me now.

31:07.868 --> 31:08.968
How long do you need, Liz?

31:09.036 --> 31:10.469
I need five minutes.
Five minutes.

31:10.537 --> 31:12.705
Five minutes now?
You said four minutes...

31:12.773 --> 31:13.973
Four minutes ago!

31:14.041 --> 31:14.974
I need five minutes
or, uh,

31:15.042 --> 31:16.142
it's not gonna be done.

31:16.210 --> 31:17.676
These  sea basses

31:17.745 --> 31:19.545
are taking
so long to cook.

31:19.613 --> 31:21.580
It's  raw
in the middle!

31:21.648 --> 31:24.650
So I'm trying to rush it, but
there is no more way to rush it.

31:24.718 --> 31:25.852
Where's the bass?

31:25.919 --> 31:27.954
The two...Two bass.

31:29.589 --> 31:30.889
Holy crap.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.958
All of you, come here.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.293
Ah, come on.

31:36.496 --> 31:37.929
<i>Look, it's raw!</i>

31:37.997 --> 31:39.998
Raw...

31:40.066 --> 31:41.467
You're going down
in flames, chick.

31:41.534 --> 31:42.701
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

31:42.769 --> 31:44.737
You took twice as long
for that table.

31:44.804 --> 31:46.338
Chef, I feel like
I had that fish down

31:46.406 --> 31:47.906
for like ten minutes.

31:47.974 --> 31:48.940
You know...

31:49.008 --> 31:50.776
You're blaming the fish.

31:50.843 --> 31:53.579
Just, like, I didn't
want to drag it anymore.

31:53.647 --> 31:55.648
Get it back in the pan!

31:55.715 --> 31:57.249
<i>Stop being a pathetic</i>
<i>little wimp.</i>

31:57.317 --> 31:58.917
Come on! Let's go!
Yes, chef.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.418
<i>And you still haven't got</i>
<i>the  table out.</i>

32:00.486 --> 32:02.820
New York strip,
is that ready or...

32:02.888 --> 32:04.622
I need a minute on my St...
On my...

32:04.690 --> 32:06.123
Come on, then, let's go!

32:06.191 --> 32:07.558
Yes, chef.
<i>So you sliced it,</i>

32:07.626 --> 32:09.594
<i>and it's not cooked.</i>

32:09.662 --> 32:11.329
It needs, like, seconds.

32:11.397 --> 32:12.797
So you take one slice off,
don't you stop there

32:12.864 --> 32:14.465
and put it back in whole?

32:14.533 --> 32:16.066
<i>Doesn't it dry out</i>
<i>when you've sliced it?</i>

32:16.134 --> 32:17.702
<i>Oh, she just shakes her head.</i>

32:17.770 --> 32:19.771
- Hold on.
- Cry time?

32:19.838 --> 32:21.306
No!

32:21.373 --> 32:23.308
Chef thinks that I'm the one
behind the eight ball,

32:23.375 --> 32:24.975
but I was trying to time
with Elizabeth,

32:25.043 --> 32:26.744
and she kept asking
for more time,

32:26.812 --> 32:28.078
asking me for more time,
asking me for more time.

32:28.146 --> 32:30.548
Excuse me.
Jeez!

32:30.616 --> 32:32.483
I was trying
to look out for the team

32:32.551 --> 32:33.651
and wait for her.

32:33.719 --> 32:34.751
The New York strip!

32:35.920 --> 32:37.153
Unbelievable.

32:38.589 --> 32:39.690
<i>Hey...</i>

32:39.757 --> 32:42.091
Just stop.
This is ridiculous.

32:42.159 --> 32:44.628
Oh, my God, we're getting
so thrown out of here.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.062
Is this the one you sliced?
Yes, chef.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.398
It's dry.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.335
What are you doing?

32:51.402 --> 32:53.036
<i>You've been to New York,</i>

32:53.103 --> 32:54.638
<i>you've had your hands</i>
<i>on the prize.</i>

32:54.706 --> 32:55.839
This is like night one
in here.

32:55.906 --> 32:57.240
No, chef.

32:57.308 --> 32:58.408
<i>And you, Elizabeth!</i>

32:58.476 --> 32:59.909
You can't time

32:59.977 --> 33:01.611
and you can't talk
to anybody.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.146
<i>You've given up over there.</i>

33:03.214 --> 33:04.715
No, chef, I...
No, chef.

33:04.782 --> 33:06.450
You and you,
Off out of here.

33:06.517 --> 33:07.917
<i>Get out!</i> 
<i>Take that with you.</i>

33:07.985 --> 33:10.486
Just leave me alone.

33:10.554 --> 33:11.987
Get out of here,
both of you.

33:12.055 --> 33:14.490
<i>Off up to the dorm.</i>

33:14.558 --> 33:16.892
Hey, you.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.494
Pick that
thing up!

33:18.562 --> 33:19.562
<i>You wanna serve</i>

33:19.629 --> 33:21.263
Overcooked meat.

33:21.331 --> 33:22.998
Now start kicking the bin.

33:23.066 --> 33:23.966
<i>Wow.</i>

33:24.033 --> 33:26.635
Un--believable!

33:26.703 --> 33:27.603
<i>Get out!</i>

33:27.671 --> 33:28.604
Off!

33:28.672 --> 33:30.010
Pathetic!

33:30.510 --> 33:31.777
<i>Embarrassing!</i>

33:39.132 --> 33:40.900
It's two hours
into dinner service,

33:40.968 --> 33:43.035
and chef Ramsay
has had enough...

33:43.103 --> 33:45.304
You and you,
Off out of here.

33:45.371 --> 33:48.908
Of Elizabeth and
Elise's careless mistakes.

33:48.976 --> 33:50.610
Hey, you.

33:50.677 --> 33:51.877
Pick that  thing up.

33:51.945 --> 33:53.145
You wanna overcook meat,

33:53.213 --> 33:54.981
now start kicking a bin.

33:55.048 --> 33:55.915
<i>Wow.</i>

33:55.983 --> 33:58.383
Un--believable.

33:58.451 --> 33:59.451
<i>Get out!</i>

33:59.519 --> 34:00.886
Jennifer...
Yes, chef?

34:00.954 --> 34:02.622
You're on your own.
Yes, chef.

34:02.689 --> 34:03.855
<i>One cod,</i>

34:03.923 --> 34:05.556
two New York strip,
one Wellington, yes?

34:05.625 --> 34:07.325
Yes, chef.
How long, please, Natalie?

34:07.392 --> 34:09.260
Uh, on those strips,
I got at least...

34:09.328 --> 34:10.527
I got at least seven minutes.
Go on.

34:10.596 --> 34:12.063
You got everything, Jen?

34:12.130 --> 34:14.799
Uh, yep.
Cod, uh...Mashed potatoes.

34:14.867 --> 34:15.934
<i>Yep.</i>

34:16.002 --> 34:17.368
We're eight minutes
out, okay?

34:17.436 --> 34:18.536
Yes, chef.
Oh, my God.

34:18.603 --> 34:19.838
Working with chef Ramsay alone

34:19.905 --> 34:21.538
was almost nerve-racking,

34:21.606 --> 34:23.072
but it was also exciting.

34:23.141 --> 34:24.440
Four minutes to the window, yes?
Yep.

34:24.509 --> 34:25.976
Four minutes, chef.
Yeah.

34:26.043 --> 34:27.011
He was calling out
ticket times,

34:27.078 --> 34:28.378
waiting for me to respond.

34:28.446 --> 34:30.179
At one point, he said to me,
"I'm slicing."

34:30.248 --> 34:32.049
30 seconds,
starting to slice.

34:32.117 --> 34:34.018
Walking with garnish.
30 seconds. <i>Yeah.</i>

34:34.085 --> 34:36.353
It kind of showed me, like,
what we're supposed to be doing.

34:36.420 --> 34:38.054
I am absolutely the luckiest
girl in the world

34:38.123 --> 34:39.857
to be able to work with
chef Ramsay right now.

34:39.924 --> 34:41.458
Walking with two cod.

34:41.525 --> 34:43.193
With the last entrees served...

34:43.261 --> 34:44.494
Enjoy.

34:44.562 --> 34:45.829
<i>Looks good, Joe.</i>

34:45.897 --> 34:47.063
And both kitchens

34:47.132 --> 34:48.632
delivering desserts...

34:48.699 --> 34:50.634
A very rough night
in Hell's Kitchen...

34:50.702 --> 34:53.902
Oh, my
God, that's good.

34:53.971 --> 34:55.337
Is finally over.

34:55.405 --> 34:56.938
Clear down!
Switch off!

34:57.007 --> 34:57.940
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

35:02.379 --> 35:04.547
I've decided,
from now on in,

35:04.614 --> 35:07.583
<i>that I will not</i>
<i>select a winning team</i>

35:07.651 --> 35:09.185
<i>unless I get</i>
<i>a perfect service.</i>

35:09.252 --> 35:10.619
And, trust me,
I did not get one

35:10.688 --> 35:12.621
from either team tonight.

35:12.690 --> 35:14.023
<i>Both teams,</i>

35:14.091 --> 35:15.424
get back upstairs
to the dorm

35:15.492 --> 35:17.593
<i>and come to a consensus</i>

35:17.661 --> 35:19.128
<i>on the one individual</i>

35:19.196 --> 35:19.996
<i>that should be</i>
<i>leaving your team</i>

35:20.064 --> 35:21.064
<i>to make you</i>

35:21.131 --> 35:23.666
more dynamic.

35:23.734 --> 35:24.600
Get upstairs.

35:28.938 --> 35:31.139
I obviously want
to do really well here,

35:31.208 --> 35:33.075
and I'm not having those
perfect services

35:33.142 --> 35:34.776
like I should be having.

35:34.844 --> 35:36.579
This could be
my last night here.

35:36.646 --> 35:37.813
It's upsetting.

35:40.083 --> 35:41.650
Anybody wanna start?

35:41.718 --> 35:43.785
I think we all know.

35:43.853 --> 35:45.521
<i>And what's that?</i>

35:45.589 --> 35:47.956
I mean, I know
I need to go up, so...

35:48.024 --> 35:49.225
<i>Oh, don't start cryin', girl.</i>

35:49.292 --> 35:51.059
Yeah, chill out, baby.

35:51.127 --> 35:52.094
Natalie, come on.

35:55.332 --> 35:57.199
Come here.
Come on.

35:57.267 --> 35:59.868
If I go up there,
he's gonna send me home.

36:02.037 --> 36:03.404
You don't know that.

36:07.042 --> 36:09.410
Natalie had a really bad
service tonight.

36:09.478 --> 36:11.112
But I feel that Elise
should go home tonight,

36:11.179 --> 36:12.913
'cause Elise is like cancer.

36:12.981 --> 36:14.515
Like, if I had a vote,
my vote would be for Elise.

36:14.583 --> 36:16.284
Couldn't believe
she came in

36:16.352 --> 36:17.318
and started yelling at me
about a Wellington

36:17.386 --> 36:18.919
when I'm trying to concentrate.

36:18.987 --> 36:20.655
<i>And chef Ramsay called her out</i>
<i>for scoring them too deep,</i>

36:20.723 --> 36:22.056
and they're
falling apart.

36:22.124 --> 36:24.125
And she's still
trying to argue

36:24.192 --> 36:26.227
when she had
raw Wellingtons.

36:26.295 --> 36:28.397
I hope she goes home
tonight.

36:30.221 --> 36:32.456
Make it short and sweet.
What's your decision?

36:32.477 --> 36:33.735
God, I don't know
what to do.

36:34.146 --> 36:35.379
<i>Do I base it</i>
<i>off of tonight,</i>

36:35.447 --> 36:36.781
<i>or do I base it on overall?</i>

36:36.836 --> 36:38.375
Tonight.
<i>Okay, just for the record,</i>

36:38.438 --> 36:39.905
chef did not say to base
your decision

36:39.972 --> 36:41.307
on tonight's performance.

36:41.374 --> 36:42.808
I know.
This is the problem.

36:42.875 --> 36:44.210
He said on making your team
stronger.

36:44.277 --> 36:45.477
<i>Right now, tonight,</i>

36:45.545 --> 36:47.659
I felt like, Elizabeth,
you  lost it.

36:47.846 --> 36:50.349
But overall... <i>I think my
overall</i> <i>performance,</i>

36:50.417 --> 36:52.484
it just shows in my nominations,
that I have not been up yet.

36:54.487 --> 36:56.121
I just feel like Elizabeth
was so frustrated.

36:56.189 --> 36:57.389
<i>It was hard to look at her.</i>

36:57.457 --> 36:58.990
I am not denying you this.

36:59.058 --> 37:00.192
<i>This is why I'm talking...</i> 
It was hard for me.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.627
It was hard for me.

37:01.695 --> 37:02.828
You know I don't
play the blame game.

37:02.895 --> 37:04.597
You can just put me up!

37:04.664 --> 37:06.031
You play it
all the way up to the end.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.199
I'm telling it like it is.

37:07.267 --> 37:08.734
You'll continue to blame
until the end.

37:08.801 --> 37:10.502
If you wanna put me up,
put me up.

37:10.570 --> 37:13.705
I don't know
who I wanna put up, okay?

37:13.772 --> 37:14.972
Give me a minute,
all right?

37:25.117 --> 37:26.484
I'm getting nervous,

37:26.552 --> 37:27.852
because you're not
getting better.

37:30.456 --> 37:31.989
<i>Will, the nominee and why.</i>

37:32.057 --> 37:33.924
Natalie, chef.

37:33.992 --> 37:36.093
She couldn't
cook fish tonight.

37:36.161 --> 37:37.194
Jennifer...

37:37.263 --> 37:39.597
<i>The nominee and why, please.</i>

37:42.171 --> 37:43.723
Uh, nominee is...

37:47.372 --> 37:48.872
Um...

37:59.759 --> 38:01.927
With both teams
asked to nominate one member

38:01.995 --> 38:03.329
for elimination,

38:03.397 --> 38:05.416
the Blue Team
has chosen Natalie.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.402
Jennifer...
The nominee and why, please.

38:11.238 --> 38:12.949
Elise, chef.

38:14.274 --> 38:15.408
<i>Her biggest problem is</i>

38:15.475 --> 38:17.276
she doesn't admit mistakes.

38:17.344 --> 38:19.612
<i>She's first to blame</i>
<i>everyone else,</i>

38:19.680 --> 38:21.280
except herself.

38:21.348 --> 38:22.881
<i>Elise, Natalie...</i>

38:22.949 --> 38:24.883
Step forward, please.

38:24.951 --> 38:26.417
Keep your head up, Natalie.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.735
<i>Natalie...Tell me</i>
<i>why you think</i>

38:33.760 --> 38:35.060
you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen.

38:35.128 --> 38:36.195
<i>I'm a talented chef.</i>

38:36.262 --> 38:37.662
I deserve to be here.

38:37.731 --> 38:39.131
I worked my ass off
to get here.

38:39.199 --> 38:40.733
I've worked my ass off
my entire life.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.101
<i>I know I'm green.</i>

38:42.168 --> 38:43.335
I know I have a lot
to learn.

38:43.402 --> 38:45.871
But I know that,
in the end,

38:45.939 --> 38:47.439
I can be
what BLT's looking for.

38:47.506 --> 38:48.974
It's your third time
up here.

38:49.042 --> 38:52.044
<i>I can't inspire you</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

38:52.112 --> 38:54.113
There are no places
left to hide.

38:55.982 --> 38:56.949
<i>Elise...</i>

38:57.016 --> 38:58.917
<i>I cannot believe</i>

38:58.985 --> 39:00.886
you had the audacity
to blame Tommy

39:00.954 --> 39:02.320
<i>for your mess.</i>

39:02.388 --> 39:04.022
When are you ever
gonna step up and...

39:04.090 --> 39:05.357
Right now.
Take responsibility...

39:05.424 --> 39:07.024
Right now! Right now!
<i>Oh, really?</i>

39:07.092 --> 39:08.826
You need to go home.
You have a family at home.

39:08.894 --> 39:10.128
No, I don't want
to go home!

39:10.195 --> 39:11.996
<i>If I don't shine</i>
<i>on my next service</i>

39:12.064 --> 39:13.430
and perform perfectly,

39:13.498 --> 39:15.099
then I'll throw myself
out of here!

39:15.167 --> 39:17.001
<i>Opportunities like this</i>
<i>don't come</i>

39:17.069 --> 39:18.402
<i>where I'm from.</i>

39:18.470 --> 39:19.703
And I'm very thankful
to be here.

39:19.772 --> 39:21.605
<i>I can really cook, chef.</i>

39:21.673 --> 39:24.341
And I'm just not ready to go
until I prove that.

39:24.409 --> 39:25.609
<i>Okay.</i>

39:25.677 --> 39:27.411
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

39:29.982 --> 39:30.948
Is...

39:32.684 --> 39:34.018
Did you
or did you not score

39:34.086 --> 39:35.286
the first tray
of Wellingtons?

39:35.353 --> 39:36.754
No.

39:41.393 --> 39:43.693
Oh, come on.
Table 23, table 21.

39:43.761 --> 39:45.528
Every single table
on the blue side

39:45.596 --> 39:46.997
has complained about
the sea bass tonight.

39:47.064 --> 39:48.464
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.

39:48.532 --> 39:50.532
You hit the nail
on the head there.

39:50.734 --> 39:51.935
Natalie...

39:52.003 --> 39:54.404
Please take off
your jacket.

39:58.276 --> 40:00.043
Look at me.
Continue cooking.

40:00.111 --> 40:01.077
Big heart.

40:01.145 --> 40:02.271
Love the energy.

40:02.373 --> 40:05.108
But you are not ready to
run BLT Steak in New York.

40:05.176 --> 40:06.458
Please give me
your jacket.

40:07.912 --> 40:09.145
Thank you for the effort.

40:09.213 --> 40:10.546
Thank you.
And do not stop.

40:10.639 --> 40:11.281
Okay?

40:11.348 --> 40:13.116
Do not stop.

40:13.184 --> 40:15.112
<i>Keep your head up,</i>
<i>Natalie!</i>

40:18.431 --> 40:20.331
Come on, guys.
Keep talking to each other!

40:20.399 --> 40:21.433
Two Wellington, chef.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.774
Natalie, good job.

40:22.813 --> 40:25.215
I came to Hell's Kitchen
to prove to myself

40:25.283 --> 40:26.949
that I'm a good chef.

40:27.017 --> 40:28.618
You got
butternut squash puree?

40:28.686 --> 40:30.187
Yes...I...Do.

40:30.254 --> 40:31.555
Joining the Blue Team...

40:31.622 --> 40:32.522
<i>Natalie.</i>

40:32.590 --> 40:34.123
I just couldn't imagine

40:34.192 --> 40:36.660
sharing an experience
like this

40:36.727 --> 40:38.127
with anyone other
than the Blue Team.

40:38.196 --> 40:41.198
No more  grapes!

40:41.265 --> 40:43.766
I'm not doing it anymore!

40:43.834 --> 40:45.835
One, two, three!  Blue!

40:45.903 --> 40:47.536
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> was one of

40:47.604 --> 40:49.138
the hardest things
I've ever done in my life.

40:49.206 --> 40:50.639
I have a teammate
that thinks

40:50.708 --> 40:52.141
I was trying to  him
on purpose.

40:52.209 --> 40:54.677
I came in here with
the attitude that I could do it,

40:54.745 --> 40:56.378
and I never stopped
having that attitude.

40:56.446 --> 40:57.613
That's awesome.

40:57.681 --> 40:59.115
It's what I do, boys.

40:59.183 --> 41:00.983
It's definitely
disappointing.

41:01.051 --> 41:02.719
I obviously came here to win.

41:02.786 --> 41:07.223
And, deep down, I know
I could have done it.

41:11.028 --> 41:12.461
Each and every one of you,

41:12.529 --> 41:14.931
I've seen glimpses
of brilliance.

41:14.998 --> 41:16.132
<i>But I've got to</i>

41:16.200 --> 41:17.767
see that level
of inspiration.

41:17.835 --> 41:19.535
<i>Got it?</i>

41:19.603 --> 41:20.436
Yes, chef!

41:20.503 --> 41:22.504
Get out of here.

41:22.572 --> 41:24.273
Elise should have gone home.

41:24.341 --> 41:26.041
I know she's gonna
wake up tomorrow

41:26.109 --> 41:28.344
and she's gonna throw me
or Elizabeth under the bus.

41:28.411 --> 41:30.579
It's gonna be <i>groundhog day</i>
all over again.

41:30.647 --> 41:32.981
There's only three
people in each kitchen.

41:33.049 --> 41:34.450
No reason to blame
anybody else.

41:34.517 --> 41:36.452
There's no excuses anymore.

41:36.519 --> 41:38.387
So now it's put up
or shut up.

41:38.455 --> 41:39.921
Thank you, chef Ramsay,

41:39.989 --> 41:41.890
for giving me another day
in hell.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.759
I'm gonna
step up my game 200%,

41:43.826 --> 41:45.227
because, at this point,

41:45.295 --> 41:46.762
I don't feel like
anyone else

41:46.829 --> 41:48.464
is standing in my way
but myself.

41:50.099 --> 41:51.599
Natalie was lucky enough

41:51.667 --> 41:53.735
to get to see BLT Steak
in New York.

41:53.802 --> 41:57.037
She may get to see it again
as a customer.

42:02.343 --> 42:04.944
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:05.012 --> 42:07.847
The restaurant is closed
for a very special event.

42:07.915 --> 42:09.916
Never before have we done

42:09.984 --> 42:12.486
something as important
as tonight's charity event.

42:12.553 --> 42:14.488
And chef Ramsay
wants a perfect evening

42:14.555 --> 42:15.855
for his V.I.P. guests.

42:15.923 --> 42:17.324
I'm so embarrassed!

42:17.392 --> 42:20.160
Tommy! I wanna
smack Tommy in the face!

42:20.227 --> 42:22.796
But can the chefs work together?

42:22.863 --> 42:24.563
Let me do my thing. I'm not gonna
let you do something that's wrong.

42:24.631 --> 42:28.131
Or will it be chef Ramsay's
most humiliating dinner service yet?

42:28.178 --> 42:30.550
Why? Why tonight? Look at that!

42:31.286 --> 42:32.719
With the coveted black jackets

42:32.787 --> 42:34.121
going to the survivors...

42:34.189 --> 42:35.522
What the hell
is wrong with you guys?

42:35.590 --> 42:37.091
Trying to sabotage me?

42:37.158 --> 42:39.226
She's
with the wrong person.

42:39.294 --> 42:40.836
The chefs
will stop at nothing...

42:40.891 --> 42:42.645
- Back off!
- And I mean nothing...

42:42.684 --> 42:44.607
War is on.
What?

42:44.639 --> 42:46.574
To make it to the final five.

42:46.641 --> 42:48.075
<i>Tonight, all of you</i>

42:48.142 --> 42:49.844
can be leaving
this  competition.

42:49.911 --> 42:51.879
On an episode unlike any other.

42:51.947 --> 42:53.413
And get ready
to plead for your life.

42:53.482 --> 42:55.015
Are you  kidding me?

42:55.083 --> 42:56.383
That's next time

42:56.451 --> 42:57.617
on <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>
