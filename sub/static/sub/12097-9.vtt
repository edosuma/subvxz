and a Subaru got through.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.181
to help take the wings
off the plane

10:16.182 --> 10:18.183
so the traffic
could get through.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.206
[CLEARS THROAT]

10:41.207 --> 10:42.207
Well, I...

10:42.208 --> 10:44.709
I hope you weren't too worried.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.711
I'm so glad you're home.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.714
Now, what do you want
for breakfast?

10:49.715 --> 10:52.717
Oh, anything. I don't care.
Anything. I don't know.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.219
A couple of eggs, over-easy,
Canadian bacon, crisp,

10:54.220 --> 10:57.223
sour dough toast,
a little tangerine juice.

10:59.725 --> 11:02.727
So, uh...
what's new?

11:02.728 --> 11:03.728
Nothing much.

11:03.729 --> 11:04.729
No?

11:04.730 --> 11:05.730
No.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.732
What did you do yesterday?

11:07.733 --> 11:08.733
Nothing much.

11:08.734 --> 11:11.236
No?
No.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.738
I thought you went to school.

11:13.739 --> 11:17.242
Oh, that's right, I did.
I forgot.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.744
Forgot?
How do you forget school?

11:19.745 --> 11:23.248
Well, I've been up all night.
My brain's like these eggs.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.250
So... how is school?

11:25.251 --> 11:27.252
It's okay, I guess.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.754
How is your professor?

11:31.257 --> 11:32.257
My professor?

11:32.258 --> 11:34.259
Yeah,
the good-looking professor.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.760
He's all right, I guess.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.761
Yeah, that...

11:36.762 --> 11:39.264
uh... The good-looking,
charming professor.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.265
What?

11:40.266 --> 11:41.267
Nothing.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.769
Oh.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.772
Mary, is there anything, uh...

11:47.773 --> 11:49.274
you want to say to me?

11:49.275 --> 11:50.775
No.
You sure?

11:50.776 --> 11:52.277
Well...

11:54.780 --> 11:55.780
Yeah.

11:55.781 --> 11:58.283
You mean,

11:58.284 --> 12:00.285
there's nothing you think
that we ought to discuss?

12:00.286 --> 12:01.286
No.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.292
Is there anything
you want to discuss?

12:09.795 --> 12:10.796
Yeah.

12:12.298 --> 12:13.299
What?

12:23.309 --> 12:25.310
I don't want any eggs.
Nothing. No breakfast.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.812
Nothing.
I ate on the plane.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.326
Are they serious?

12:41.327 --> 12:43.328
What?

12:43.329 --> 12:45.330
Do you know
what they have in here?

12:45.331 --> 12:47.832
Queen Bee hormones.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.834
Now, how the hell do you suppose
they go about getting that?

12:49.835 --> 12:52.337
Carefully.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.842
Mine's made from cow placenta.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.348
You peel it off,
you fall in love with a heifer.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.850
Don't make me laugh.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.352
My face will crack.

13:10.356 --> 13:13.358
Listen...

13:13.359 --> 13:16.861
Did you hear about an airplane
landing on a highway last night?

13:16.862 --> 13:18.363
No. What happened?

13:18.364 --> 13:20.366
Oh, I don't know.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.369
Maybe if I'd done this
10 years ago

13:24.370 --> 13:26.372
I'd have cheekbones by now.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.875
I always wanted to do this,
you know?

13:30.876 --> 13:32.877
To have...

13:32.878 --> 13:34.879
like... a mother,

13:34.880 --> 13:36.881
and... and we'd do
this sort of thing.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.383
My mother died when I was 6,

13:38.384 --> 13:40.385
so we never got around
to face masks.

13:40.386 --> 13:43.388
Well, I never had a daughter,

13:43.389 --> 13:44.890
and the boys
never wanted to do this.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.393
Well, Jodie... once.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.398
It's uh...

13:53.399 --> 13:54.900
It's like having a mother.

13:56.902 --> 13:59.404
It's like having a daughter.

13:59.405 --> 14:00.405
I'm just sorry

14:00.406 --> 14:01.406
it took so long to happen.

14:01.407 --> 14:02.907
Oh, I'm so glad it did.

14:02.908 --> 14:03.909
[GASPS] Oh!

14:09.415 --> 14:10.915
Burt.

14:10.916 --> 14:11.916
Burt, look at this.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.418
All this space here

14:13.419 --> 14:14.919
on top of this building?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.921
Yeah. That's where we put
the heating unit.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.424
Most of this is wasted space.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.425
So?

14:20.426 --> 14:22.427
So? So you put on
a coat of paint,

14:22.428 --> 14:23.428
you hang a few lamps

14:23.429 --> 14:24.929
and bang!

14:24.930 --> 14:26.431
Instant office space.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.932
Office space?

14:27.933 --> 14:28.933
Office space?

14:28.934 --> 14:31.937
That office space
is only four feet high.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.442
I'm way ahead of you, Burt.

14:37.443 --> 14:38.944
Midgets.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.448
Midgets?

14:43.449 --> 14:44.949
Yeah. Yeah.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.952
We rent it out to midgets.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.454
Midgets?

14:49.455 --> 14:50.455
Burt, I'm telling you,

14:50.456 --> 14:51.957
it's a great idea.

14:57.463 --> 14:58.964
Hi.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.472
Hi.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.975
How's everything?

15:10.976 --> 15:13.478
Perfect. Great.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.980
No problems?
Everything's okay, huh?

15:15.981 --> 15:17.482
Couldn't be better.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.984
Couldn't be better.

15:20.486 --> 15:21.486
Is that cement?

15:21.487 --> 15:24.489
Oh, yeah, Burt, it's cement.

15:24.490 --> 15:25.490
Oh, well, good.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.991
As long as everything's okay.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.494
Fine.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.495
Tim, is that blood?

15:30.496 --> 15:32.997
Where?
On your nose.

15:32.998 --> 15:35.500
Oh, yeah, it's blood.
A little blood on my nose.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.001
Are you okay?

15:37.002 --> 15:38.002
Great.

15:38.003 --> 15:40.004
A little cement,
a little blood on my nose...

15:40.005 --> 15:41.506
fine.

15:41.507 --> 15:44.008
How did you get
the blood on your nose?

15:44.009 --> 15:45.009
From falling.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.011
I think from falling.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.012
You fell?

15:48.013 --> 15:49.514
In the cement.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.015
How did you fall?

15:51.016 --> 15:52.016
When the guy yelled "help."

15:52.017 --> 15:53.518
When what guy yelled "help"?

15:53.519 --> 15:55.020
The guy who fell first.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.523
Hey. How did
he fall?

15:58.524 --> 15:59.524
He slipped.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.025
How did he slip, Tim?

16:01.026 --> 16:04.028
When the bologna
dropped out of my lunch pail.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.530
And you reached out

16:05.531 --> 16:06.531
to grab him,

16:06.532 --> 16:07.532
then you fell.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.534
Did you see it happen?

16:09.535 --> 16:11.035
No.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.537
I've been in this business
a long time, Tim.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.038
Then I tripped.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.541
On the bologna.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.042
You guys are uncanny.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.544
What happened to the other guy,

16:19.545 --> 16:20.545
the guy who fell?

16:20.546 --> 16:21.546
Oh, he's okay.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.047
He landed in the big sand thing.

16:23.048 --> 16:24.549
Truck?

16:24.550 --> 16:26.551
Right. The truck.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.052
He broke his thermos.

16:28.053 --> 16:31.055
I'll bet.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.558
Well, I've taken
enough of your time.

16:33.559 --> 16:34.559
It's all right.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.562
You just drop by
any time you like, Tim.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.063
Actually, I came by to quit.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.064
I wrote my resignation

16:40.065 --> 16:42.567
on the bologna wrapper.

16:45.571 --> 16:46.571
Yeah, well,

16:46.572 --> 16:48.573
everything seems to be in order.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.074
You forgot the date.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.076
No. There it is.
It's right there.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.079
See, that's the date
the bologna expires.

16:56.582 --> 16:57.582
I'll see you.

16:57.583 --> 16:58.583
Wait a minute.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.084
Wait... Wait a minute.

17:00.085 --> 17:01.085
What are doing?
Why are you quitting?

17:01.086 --> 17:02.587
Come on, look,
aren't you happy here?

17:02.588 --> 17:04.589
I'm a jinx.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.089
Tim, you're not a jinx.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.092
Burt, I almost killed
somebody today.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.594
I already have my mother's blood

17:09.595 --> 17:12.096
on my hands.

17:12.097 --> 17:13.598
I think you're both terrific,

17:13.598 --> 17:15.599
and I'll never forget
what you've done for me.

17:15.601 --> 17:16.601
But for everbody involved,

17:16.602 --> 17:19.103
it's better if I go.

17:19.104 --> 17:20.104
Goodbye.

17:20.105 --> 17:21.105
So long.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.108
And thanks.

17:28.074 --> 17:30.114
I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe it's for the best.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.617
I don't think he was cut out
for this kind of work.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.618
Yeah...
I guess so.

17:33.619 --> 17:34.619
But Burt,

17:34.620 --> 17:36.120
about my idea
for the office space

17:36.121 --> 17:37.121
for the midgets...

17:37.122 --> 17:39.624
Midgets.
Will you stop with the midgets?

17:39.625 --> 17:41.626
Midgets get office space
for free, Danny.

17:41.627 --> 17:42.627
They do?

17:42.628 --> 17:44.128
Of course...
you never heard of

17:44.129 --> 17:45.630
the Small Business
Administration?

17:51.136 --> 17:52.637
Open mine.
Open mine.

[GASPS]

17:57.643 --> 17:59.645
Oh, Elaine.

18:01.146 --> 18:02.146
Oh, thank you.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.648
I hope you like it.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.150
I hope it helps.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.153
Well, I hope
that's the last present

18:09.154 --> 18:11.155
so you all
can just clear out of there.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.157
[WHISPERS] Benson!

18:13.158 --> 18:16.160
I was wondering...

18:16.161 --> 18:17.161
did anyone happen to hear

18:17.162 --> 18:19.163
about a plane that landed
on the highway?

18:19.164 --> 18:20.164
ALL: No.

18:20.165 --> 18:23.668
Okay. That's it. Party's over.
Up and out.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.671
No more coffee.

18:26.672 --> 18:30.174
I got so many lovely presents.
Thank you so much.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.677
Thank you very much.
That's very nice.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.679
Good luck and goodbye.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.683
Benson, we are not finished yet.
I want to make a toast.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.185
With what? You don't have
anything in your hand.

18:41.186 --> 18:43.688
You mean
it doesn't work otherwise?

18:43.689 --> 18:44.689
No.

18:44.690 --> 18:45.690
It'll work, Mother.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.192
Okay.

18:48.193 --> 18:50.195
I want to make a toast
to Jodie and Carol.

18:51.697 --> 18:56.201
May they be as happy
as we all are.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.207
Well, uh...

19:03.208 --> 19:05.710
perhaps that wasn't
the correct toast to make.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.211
It was a lovely toast, Jess.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.714
Oh, Mary, I don't know.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.716
I mean, look at all of us.

19:11.717 --> 19:15.219
I'm married to a man
who doesn't remember.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.222

19:18.223 --> 19:20.725
Corinne is married

19:20.726 --> 19:23.728
to a depressed
ex-priest.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.229
Carol is going to marry

19:25.230 --> 19:28.733
a homosexual,

19:28.734 --> 19:32.737
and Elaine is married
to somebody who had to marry her

19:32.738 --> 19:34.739
or get killed.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.241
You're the only one, Mary,

19:37.242 --> 19:38.743
with a normal marriage.

19:38.744 --> 19:43.748

that the toast should be...

19:43.749 --> 19:47.251
may everyone end up
with as beautiful a marriage

19:47.252 --> 19:48.753
as Mary's.

19:51.256 --> 19:55.760

the correct toast to make

19:55.761 --> 19:56.761
either.

19:56.762 --> 19:57.762
Uh...

19:57.763 --> 19:58.763

out in the kitchen

20:01.767 --> 20:02.767

the refrigerator.

Yes. Yes.

Come, come, girls.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.271
You'll see the refrigerator.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.273
Oh, good. You know, I've never
seen your refrigerator.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.775
Oh, it's a
terrific refrigerator.

and, the other night,
he stayed out all night,

20:34.299 --> 20:36.300
and he came home with
this cockamamie story

20:36.301 --> 20:39.303
about a plane
landing on the highway,

20:39.304 --> 20:43.808
and when he came home
that morning, Jess,

20:43.809 --> 20:44.809
he had already showered.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.310
How do you know?

20:46.311 --> 20:51.816
His hair was damp,
and he smelled of soap...

20:51.817 --> 20:53.317
a woman's soap.

20:53.318 --> 20:58.323
Men are so dumb to shower.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.327
I mean,
Chester used to come home

21:03.328 --> 21:05.329
after a long, hard day's work

21:05.330 --> 21:08.333
smelling better
than when he left.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.335
How could he do it, Jess?

21:11.336 --> 21:13.337
How could he do that to me?

21:13.338 --> 21:14.339
Uh...

21:19.344 --> 21:23.347
Mary, you have to talk to him.

21:23.348 --> 21:24.348
Are you kidding?

21:24.349 --> 21:26.851
Oh, Mary, you have to.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.353
I mean, one affair doesn't mean

21:29.354 --> 21:30.855
the end of the marriage.

21:30.856 --> 21:31.856
I mean, if it did,

21:31.857 --> 21:33.357
Chester and I
would have been finished

21:33.358 --> 21:35.360
on the honeymoon.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.363
On your honeymoon?

21:40.365 --> 21:44.369
Well, looking back, probably.

21:46.371 --> 21:47.872
Because I...

21:47.873 --> 21:50.875
I really can't think
of any other reason

21:50.876 --> 21:53.377
for the chambermaid's
underpanties

21:53.378 --> 21:54.879
to end up in my suitcase.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.383
Oh, Jess.

22:00.385 --> 22:01.386
Oh, Jess.

22:04.389 --> 22:07.391
It hurts, Mary. I know.

22:07.392 --> 22:08.893
I know,

22:08.894 --> 22:16.400
and you feel so ugly
and clumsy and stupid,

22:16.401 --> 22:17.401
so self-conscious

22:17.402 --> 22:20.404
you don't even want
to walk around in front of him.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.908
You don't even want to talk
in front of him,

22:23.909 --> 22:29.914
and you're sure he hates you
and everything's all over...

22:29.915 --> 22:32.416
but it isn't.

22:32.417 --> 22:33.918
It isn't, Mary.

22:33.919 --> 22:37.922
It feels like it is.

22:37.923 --> 22:41.425
I know. I know.

22:41.426 --> 22:43.427
[SNIFFLES]

22:43.428 --> 22:46.431
Isn't this nice?

22:48.433 --> 22:50.434
Nice?

22:50.435 --> 22:51.936
My husband is having an affair,

22:51.937 --> 22:53.437
and you're calling it "nice"?

22:53.438 --> 22:54.438
But you know

22:54.439 --> 22:56.440
what is nice about it, Mary?

22:56.441 --> 22:58.442
I always come running to you

22:58.443 --> 23:00.945
for help.

23:00.946 --> 23:01.946
This is the first time

23:01.947 --> 23:03.948
I've ever been able to help you.

23:03.949 --> 23:08.953
Oh, Jessie, you always help

23:08.954 --> 23:11.455
just by being you
and being here.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.958
You always help.

23:13.959 --> 23:14.959
Ooh.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.460
BENSON: Okay, that's it.
Tour's over.

23:16.461 --> 23:17.962
Refrigerator is closed.

23:17.963 --> 23:18.963
Let's move 'em out!

23:18.964 --> 23:22.466
Hup, hup, hup, ho.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.969
