00:02.003 --> 00:04.039
Previously on Lost:

00:04.130 --> 00:05.165
Now talk.

00:05.256 --> 00:08.339
Think of the island like a record,
spinning on a turntable,

00:08.426 --> 00:11.008
only now, that record is skipping.

00:11.095 --> 00:15.885
Whatever Ben Linus did
at The Orchid station, it may have...

00:15.975 --> 00:19.138
- ...dislodged us.
- Dislodged us from what?

00:19.228 --> 00:20.434
Time.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.643
Come on!

00:26.027 --> 00:28.234
It's not stopping!

00:30.740 --> 00:31.775
Charlotte!

00:36.204 --> 00:38.115
We have to go back to The Orchid.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.788
That's where all this started,
maybe it's where it will all stop.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.661
This is because they left.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.834
lt'll stop if I can bring them back.

00:44.921 --> 00:46.502
- Bring who back?
- Jack.

00:46.589 --> 00:48.921
Sun, Sayid, Hugo, Kate...

00:49.008 --> 00:50.964
Don't you want her to come back?

00:53.763 --> 00:57.676
- Want us to lower you down?
- Where would be the fun in that?

01:02.104 --> 01:04.015
Uh-oh.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.357
John! Damn it, hold on!

01:13.532 --> 01:15.989
I think you can
let go of that now.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.326
No.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.123
No, no, no...

01:25.211 --> 01:29.204
- James, don't.
- Come on, help me.

01:31.384 --> 01:35.093
James... Stop.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.261
We can't help him.

01:37.348 --> 01:40.090
Wherever John went, he's gone.

01:41.060 --> 01:44.427
And wherever we are
is before that well was ever built.

01:44.522 --> 01:47.355
Yeah, I'd say way before.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.852
What makes you...

02:09.922 --> 02:13.289
James! Can you hear me?

02:13.384 --> 02:15.670
Can anyone hear me?

02:49.754 --> 02:51.039
What the hell was that?

02:51.922 --> 02:54.299
That one was different.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.834
That was more like an earthquake.

02:59.930 --> 03:03.468
- Locke!
- James... Wait!

03:13.319 --> 03:14.855
Great.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.114
My headache is gone.

03:26.957 --> 03:31.166
Yeah, mine is too.
And my nose isn't bleeding anymore.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.089
I think it's over.

03:43.516 --> 03:45.177
I think John did it.

03:51.649 --> 03:52.980
Now what?

03:56.904 --> 03:59.395
Now, we wait for him to come back.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.364
For how long?

04:09.375 --> 04:12.117
As long as it takes.

04:40.406 --> 04:44.399
Are you kidding me? I'm gone ten minutes
and you're having a hootenanny?

04:44.493 --> 04:48.202
Don't be such a bummer. Rosie was
just dropping off some brownies.

04:48.289 --> 04:50.530
You should thank her.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.366
She shouldn't be here, Jerry.
We're on the clock.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.624
Mellow out, Phil.
What's gonna happen?

04:56.714 --> 04:59.456
Polar bears gonna
figure a way out of their cages?

04:59.550 --> 05:02.166
That's not the point.
If LaFleur finds out...

05:02.261 --> 05:05.424
- LaFleur's not gonna find out.
- Guys?

05:05.514 --> 05:07.891
- Relax, nobody's gonna find out.
- Guys?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.715
What... ?

05:15.316 --> 05:18.433
- Is that a hostile?
- I don't know.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.780
Is that... Horace?

05:43.219 --> 05:46.757
- He's got dynamite.
- Get her out of here. Now!

05:46.847 --> 05:49.304
Rosie, don't tell
anyone you were here. Go!

05:49.391 --> 05:52.007
- Oh, this is bad, man.
- We gotta get LaFleur.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.309
- 3.00am. You wanna wake him?
- No, but...

05:54.396 --> 05:57.479
- Maybe we can handle this.
- Maybe Horace blows himself up

05:57.566 --> 05:59.648
and LaFleur kills us
for not waking him.

05:59.735 --> 06:00.815
We gotta go. Now.

06:09.370 --> 06:13.033
- You wanna knock?
- You knock.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.948
Fine.

06:25.594 --> 06:26.709
What?

06:26.804 --> 06:31.343
Mr. LaFleur, sorry to bother you, but
we've got a situation out at the pylons.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.471
What kind of situation?

06:35.813 --> 06:37.303
lt's Horace.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.811
He's got dynamite
and he's blowing up trees.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.899
Son of a bitch.

07:10.723 --> 07:12.054
Relax! I'm coming.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.936
- Hey, boss.
- Evening, Enos. You got your zapper?

07:23.027 --> 07:26.190
Yup. Wanna tell me why I need it?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.863
Our fearless leader's
out blowing up trees.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.566
Why's he doing that?

07:32.870 --> 07:34.576
Because he's loaded.

07:34.705 --> 07:37.538
- Since when does Horace drink?
- He doesn't.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.367
So we're gonna keep this
on the down low.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.552
- Oh, man.
- All right.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.885
Put out that fire, pack up the dynamite.
I'll take him home.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.221
Why don't you put out the fire,
pack up, and I'll take him home.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.432
You wanna tell
Amy where we found him?

08:08.906 --> 08:10.988
Help me get him up.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.912
- Oh, my God, is he OK?
- You tell me.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.331
Bring him inside.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.630
The couch is fine.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.302
Where'd you find him?

08:33.430 --> 08:37.139
By the Flame. Blowing up trees
with dynamite.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.007
Wanna tell me why?

08:40.729 --> 08:43.892
- We had a fight.
- Must've been a doozy.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.895
- Please, Jim... lt's personal.
- Personal?

08:47.986 --> 08:50.318
You think this isn't gonna get out?

08:50.447 --> 08:53.610
It'll be on the coconut
telegraph by breakfast.

08:57.121 --> 08:58.611
It was about Paul.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.205
Go on.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.034
What's the matter? You OK?

09:07.673 --> 09:11.131
The baby. It's coming!

09:14.805 --> 09:16.136
Oh, hell.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.560
Not gonna tell...

09:31.989 --> 09:33.525
- Where's Red?
- I don't know.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.068
I won't...

09:36.660 --> 09:39.322
I won't tell.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.820
Daniel?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.827
Are you OK?

09:46.879 --> 09:50.337
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna tell.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.040
Daniel, where's Charlotte?

09:54.386 --> 09:55.421
She's not here.

09:57.598 --> 10:01.011
She... She's gone.

10:02.394 --> 10:06.603
- Where?
- She's dead.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.147
She's dead.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.601
There was another flash...

10:13.614 --> 10:15.195
...and she was just gone.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.241
Her body just...

10:22.539 --> 10:23.949
...disappeared.

10:27.211 --> 10:30.169
She moved on, and we stayed.

10:33.592 --> 10:36.459
- I'm so sorry.
- Hold on, wait a minute.

10:36.553 --> 10:40.922
We stayed? We're not traveling
through time anymore? It's over?

10:41.058 --> 10:43.049
Of course it's over.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.134
Wherever we are now...

10:47.105 --> 10:49.892
Whenever we are now...

10:54.696 --> 10:57.073
...we're here for good.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.278
- I won't do it.
- OK.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.198
I won't. I'm not...

11:04.289 --> 11:07.656
- OK.
- I won't...

11:11.588 --> 11:13.124
OK, swell.

11:13.257 --> 11:16.465
Until Dan checks back in,
I say we head back to the beach.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.134
When Locke gets back,
that's where they'll look.

11:19.263 --> 11:24.257
The beach? You didn't get enough
flaming arrows shot at you?

11:24.351 --> 11:27.468
And your camp is gone.
Why bother?

11:29.106 --> 11:30.892
Sawyer's right, Miles.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.440
We should go back to the beach.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.518
We survived before,
we can do it again.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.104
Or when we get there, you'll
wanna go back to The Orchid again.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.281
Then we can head
back to the beach.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.484
It's the only two plans
you people have.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.657
Zip it. I'm heading back to the beach.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.660
Our stuff's there, great.
If not, we build new stuff.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.876
You don't like the plan? Good luck.

11:55.299 --> 11:56.664
Who put him in charge?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.936
Thanks for getting my back.

12:12.024 --> 12:15.141
You should thank me.
It was a stupid idea.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.277
What does that say
about you agreeing?

12:19.364 --> 12:21.025
Any plan's better than no plan.

12:21.158 --> 12:25.447
lfl didn't agree with you, we'd still
be arguing about where to go next.

12:25.537 --> 12:29.155
| just hope you figure out
something better before we get there.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.365
Well, I'm open to suggestions.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.351
Oh, no. No, Paul!

12:51.438 --> 12:53.770
Oh, God! Oh, God! No, no, no, no!

12:53.857 --> 12:55.597
No, please! No!

12:57.527 --> 12:59.688
Please. Please do something.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.066
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

13:02.199 --> 13:05.908
We werejust having... Paul, Paul...

13:08.205 --> 13:10.821
Oh, my God. No! No!

13:14.753 --> 13:16.118
Who do you think they are?

13:16.213 --> 13:19.455
Who cares who they are?
We don't even know when they are.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.834
Hey.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.041
Dan!

13:22.135 --> 13:24.000
We don't get involved, right?

13:24.096 --> 13:26.303
That's what you said.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.631
It doesn't matter what we do.

13:29.935 --> 13:33.268
Whatever happened, happened.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.642
Yeah, thanks anyway, Plato.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.189
I'm going over there.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.404
- Still got my back?
- Absolutely.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.323
- Talk to me! Talk to me...
- On your feet!

13:46.410 --> 13:49.618
- No...
- Now!

13:50.247 --> 13:52.738
- Shut up!
- All right, drop the gun.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.410
Don't!

14:19.860 --> 14:20.975
It's all right.

14:21.069 --> 14:25.358
It's OK, you're safe. It's over.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.942
Who are you?

14:47.679 --> 14:49.920
Her friend's wearing
a Dharma jumpsuit.

14:50.015 --> 14:53.098
- That puts us '70s, '80s...
- The guys with the bags...

14:53.185 --> 14:54.891
- Others?
- Beats me.

14:54.978 --> 14:58.971
- What, you all don't know each other?
- Before my time.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.270
Sawyer! Walkie.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.520
- We need to go.
- I'm on it.

15:08.617 --> 15:11.905
Listen, sweetheart,
we gotta get moving now.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.110
Who are you people?

15:14.998 --> 15:18.582
Our ship wrecked on the way
to Tahiti, but that ain't important.

15:18.668 --> 15:22.126
Because whoever's on the end of this?
Those two might've called

15:22.214 --> 15:24.000
before we saved you.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.674
- We have to bury them.
- Bury them?

15:27.761 --> 15:31.754
- We ain't got time to bury nobody.
- We have to! The truce...

15:31.848 --> 15:34.760
Oh, God... we have to bury them.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.263
And we have...

15:37.354 --> 15:41.097
We have to bring him back home.

15:41.191 --> 15:45.685
We have to bring
Paul back with us. Please?

15:47.823 --> 15:49.188
Please?

15:50.700 --> 15:52.076
Please?

15:54.538 --> 15:55.744
l'll carry him.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.875
We'll put these guys in the ground,
carry your friend back.

16:02.003 --> 16:06.542
- But we'd better do it fast.
- He wasn't my friend.

16:10.053 --> 16:13.386
He was my husband.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.562
All right, listen up.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.856
There's gonna be
a lot of questions,

16:28.947 --> 16:31.108
so just let me do the talking.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.903
You think you can convince
them we were in a boat wreck?

16:34.035 --> 16:37.243
I'm a professional.
I used to lie for a living.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.704
Daniel! Stop!

16:59.352 --> 17:02.435
- Turn it off.
- Turn what off?

17:02.522 --> 17:06.106
Whatever that is. Looks like
some sort of sonic fence or something.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.397
Where did you say
your ship was going?

17:10.488 --> 17:13.104
We saved your life
and hid those bodies.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.987
How about you trust us
and turn that damn thing off?

17:18.747 --> 17:21.705
OK... OK, fine.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.673
Sonic fence? Didn't I say
let me do the talking?

17:35.805 --> 17:37.545
Dan would've fried his brain.

17:37.641 --> 17:40.348
His brain's already fried.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.263
OK, it's off.

17:48.818 --> 17:49.978
You first.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.737
See? It's fine.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.574
All right. Let's go.

18:01.665 --> 18:05.499
But going forward, we should
all do a betterjob of trusting...

18:23.979 --> 18:25.935
It hurts.

18:26.022 --> 18:29.014
You're going to be OK.
Just try and relax.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.853
Where's Horace?
Does he know his wife's in labor?

18:34.990 --> 18:38.448
- He's unavailable.
- The baby's breech.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.366
- What's that mean?
- Upside-down.

18:40.495 --> 18:43.111
- She needs a cesarean.
- Don't tell me! Just do it!

18:43.206 --> 18:44.707
I'm not an obstetrician.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.040
Our women always
deliver on the mainland.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.831
Amy was supposed to go Tuesday.
The baby's two weeks early.

18:52.173 --> 18:55.882
- Can you deliver this baby or not?
- I don't know.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.349
Hey, Matt! Where is she?

19:19.409 --> 19:22.151
- What's up?
- Amy's having her baby.

19:22.245 --> 19:25.487
- What?
- Did you hear me?

19:25.582 --> 19:29.370
She's in trouble.
Doc says she needs a cesarean.

19:29.878 --> 19:33.462
- We had an agreement.
- Screw our agreement.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.502
He ain't never done one.
I'm guessing you have.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.333
Don't you understand?

19:38.428 --> 19:43.388
Every time I try to help a woman on
this island give birth it hasn't worked.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.930
Maybe whatever made
that happen hasn't happened yet.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.020
You've gotta try.
You gotta help her.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.063
You're the only one who can.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.950
- The baby's breech?
- Yes, but...

20:04.079 --> 20:06.320
Did you try an external
cephalic version?

20:06.456 --> 20:07.866
- No.
- It's too late.

20:07.957 --> 20:12.121
I need a number 12 scalpel, 14 gauge
sutures, half-round if you've got them,

20:12.212 --> 20:14.624
- and an epidural.
- You're gonna need?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.000
- Where is Horace?
- I'm speaking for Horace,

20:17.133 --> 20:18.714
and she's delivering this baby.

20:18.802 --> 20:23.421
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- I want her. I want her to do it.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.051
You heard the lady.

20:33.942 --> 20:38.402
Listen, you're gonna do great.
I know you are.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.151
OK.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.491
OK.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.545
Is everything OK?

21:01.636 --> 21:05.345
- Amy went into labor.
- I know.

21:05.473 --> 21:09.261
- Is she OK?
- I don't know. There was a problem.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.764
- Juliet's in there.
- Juliet?

21:11.855 --> 21:13.641
I pulled her out of retirement.

21:17.694 --> 21:21.107
- Any luck?
- We finished grid 133 today...

21:21.197 --> 21:25.611
No sign of our people.
No one.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.735
Well... 134 then.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.327
How long do we look, James?

21:35.420 --> 21:36.751
As long as it takes.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.042
What happened?

21:47.265 --> 21:50.598
- It's a boy.
- He's OK? She's OK?

21:53.188 --> 21:55.224
Everyone's OK.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.582
How's your head?

22:21.966 --> 22:23.046
It hurts.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.423
- Where are my people?
- They're fine.

22:29.265 --> 22:32.632
Amy told me what happened.
I appreciate what you did.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.977
Well, you all got a funny way
of showing your appreciation.

22:36.105 --> 22:40.599
We have a defense protocol.
There are hostile people on this island

22:40.693 --> 22:43.605
and we don't
get along with them. So...

22:43.738 --> 22:46.650
...why don't you tell me
who the hell you are.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.527
My name's James LaFleur.
You can call me Jim.

22:52.622 --> 22:55.238
How did you get
to the island, Jim?

22:56.417 --> 22:58.908
If my friends are safe,
why are you asking me?

22:59.003 --> 23:00.834
They told me I need to talk to you.

23:00.964 --> 23:04.252
That you're the boat captain.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.673
We got caught in a storm,
and our ship wrecked.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.761
Must have hit the reef.

23:12.183 --> 23:15.175
Thankfully we washed up on shore.

23:15.812 --> 23:18.804
- What kind of ship?
- Salvage vessel.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.640
We were searching
for a famous lost wreck.

23:21.776 --> 23:26.896
It's an old slaver out of Portsmouth,
England, called The Black Rock.

23:26.990 --> 23:30.482
- You ever heard of her?
- Can't say that l have.

23:32.453 --> 23:37.038
So, once you got washed ashore,
why were you wandering in the jungle?

23:37.875 --> 23:40.708
Some of our crew were missing...
we were looking.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.749
That's when we came
upon your girl instead.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.791
Well, | tell you what, Jim,

23:48.886 --> 23:51.423
if your crew shows up,
we'll send them with you.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.175
Send them where?

23:53.266 --> 23:56.258
There's a submarine
that leaves in the morning.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.468
You and your friends
are gonna get on it.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.770
It's gonna drop you off in Tahiti.

24:00.857 --> 24:03.519
You can find your way home from there.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.898
Hold on a minute, chief.
We just saved that woman's life.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.900
Doesn't that earn us
a week or two to find our people?

24:10.033 --> 24:15.744
Nope. The only people allowed to stay
are members of the Dharma lnitiative.

24:15.872 --> 24:19.285
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, Jim...

24:19.375 --> 24:21.866
You are not Dharma material.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.211
We're screwed.

24:29.344 --> 24:32.131
He's probably trying to explain
time travel by now.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.473
Sawyer's gonna be fine.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.718
What are you looking at?

24:41.272 --> 24:44.764
I lived here for over three years.
That was my house over there.

24:44.901 --> 24:48.735
- You were in the Dharma lnitiative?
- No.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.194
The Others took over these barracks

24:51.282 --> 24:53.819
and wiped out most
of the people living in them.

24:53.910 --> 24:57.744
They brought me here
on a sub a long time after that.

24:58.331 --> 25:01.073
Well, welcome home.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.247
Daniel...

25:05.380 --> 25:07.166
No more flash?

25:10.093 --> 25:12.129
No.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.468
No more flash.

25:14.764 --> 25:17.756
The record is spinning again...

25:20.645 --> 25:23.432
We're just not on the song
we want to be on.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.109
Come on, love.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.581
Charlotte.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.412
Hello.

25:47.296 --> 25:50.788
Somebody will be along shortly
to show you to your rooms.

25:50.925 --> 25:55.385
In the meantime, Mr. LaFleur here
can fill you in on the situation.

25:59.392 --> 26:03.385
- Mr. LaFleur?
- lt's Creole. l improvised.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.346
- What happened in there?
- Well, he believed my story.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.313
But we're getting punted.

26:08.443 --> 26:11.480
Bastard's putting us
on their sub to Tahiti.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.027
How's that bad news?

26:24.125 --> 26:25.990
Come on! Inside!

26:26.085 --> 26:27.495
Move, now!

26:31.007 --> 26:32.497
Come on!

26:36.179 --> 26:38.716
Heather, keep an eye on them.

27:18.888 --> 27:21.095
Uh-oh.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.284
Hello, Mr. Alpert.

27:52.672 --> 27:53.912
Hello, Mr. Goodspeed.

27:54.006 --> 27:57.498
| wish you'd told me. I would've
turned the fence off for you.

27:57.593 --> 28:02.132
That fence may keep
other things out. But not us.

28:02.223 --> 28:06.933
The only thing that does
keep us out, Horace, is our truce.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.520
Which you've now broken.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.266
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.973
Where are my two men?

28:18.698 --> 28:23.067
You know what? Getting on that sub
is starting to sound like a great idea.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.493
- What do you say? Sub?
- Hold your horses, Banzai.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.613
No one's getting on a sub.

28:29.542 --> 28:33.535
OK, LaFleur...
How well did you bury those bodies?

28:33.629 --> 28:35.494
Depends on how hard he looks.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.374
Call the Arrow.
We're at Condition One.

28:39.468 --> 28:42.960
Take the heavy ordinance.
And make sure the fence is at maximum.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.670
Yes, sir.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.926
- Let me talk to him.
- Excuse me?

28:47.018 --> 28:49.009
Your buddy with the eye-liner.

28:49.145 --> 28:51.727
We had a truce.
You don't understand...

28:51.814 --> 28:53.850
I'm the one
that killed his men.

28:53.941 --> 28:56.148
I'm the one that's
gonna go tell him why.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.520
I can't let you do that.

28:57.612 --> 29:00.399
I ain't asking your permission.

29:01.198 --> 29:04.065
James? Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

29:04.160 --> 29:07.698
Not yet. But I'll figure something out.

29:16.881 --> 29:17.961
Hello, Richard.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.004
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

29:23.679 --> 29:25.795
I'm the guy that killed your men.

29:29.352 --> 29:34.346
Heard some gunshots and saw two men
throwing a bag over a woman's head.

29:35.066 --> 29:39.184
Gave them chance to walk away,
but one of them took a shot at me.

29:39.278 --> 29:42.520
- And | defended myself.
- That so?

29:42.615 --> 29:44.401
That's so.

29:44.533 --> 29:47.240
Your people know
you're telling me this?

29:47.328 --> 29:50.035
They ain't my people, hoss.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.706
So if you got some kind of truce
with them, it ain't been broken.

29:54.502 --> 29:58.245
If you're not a member of the Dharma
lnitiative, then what are you?

30:05.721 --> 30:08.963
- Did you bury the bomb?
- Excuse me?

30:09.058 --> 30:13.518
The hydrogen bomb with "Jughead"
written on the side? Did you bury it?

30:13.604 --> 30:16.141
Yeah, I know about it.

30:16.232 --> 30:20.145
I also know 20 years ago
a bald fella limped into your camp,

30:20.236 --> 30:23.194
fed you some mumbo jumbo
about being your leader.

30:23.280 --> 30:27.239
Then, poof... he went and
disappeared right in front of you.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.567
Any of this ringing a bell?

30:31.747 --> 30:37.083
That man's name is John Locke
and I'm waiting for him to come back.

30:38.671 --> 30:42.163
So, you still think I'm a member
of the damn Dharma lnitiative?

30:43.884 --> 30:47.672
No. I guess I don't.

30:51.434 --> 30:54.892
But no matter who you are,
two of my men are dead.

30:55.688 --> 30:58.976
And my people need
some kind ofjustice.

31:00.276 --> 31:02.733
What are we gonna do about that?

31:16.292 --> 31:19.125
How are you doing, Amy?

31:21.964 --> 31:27.755
- Is he gone? Alpert?
- No. He's not gone.

31:27.845 --> 31:30.882
- We told him where the bodies were.
- Why?

31:30.973 --> 31:35.717
We had to. It was the only
way to maintain the truce.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.262
Jim here worked it out
with him, but...

31:39.356 --> 31:42.689
Well, he's gonna need
something from us now.

31:43.486 --> 31:47.354
He needs to take
Paul's body back with him.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.654
No.

31:53.245 --> 31:56.863
Hey, Ames... listen.

31:56.999 --> 31:59.365
We've been friends
for a long time, yeah?

31:59.460 --> 32:04.375
So, this is completely your choice.

32:04.507 --> 32:10.173
If you don't want to give him to them,
then we will suffer the consequences.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.855
They can take him.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.939
He would want to keep us safe.

32:33.911 --> 32:35.697
Can I have a minute, please?

33:03.274 --> 33:05.890
I'm sorry.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.491
You need some help?

33:18.122 --> 33:20.659
No, I've got it, thanks.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.710
Hey, Jim...

33:23.794 --> 33:28.128
The sub leaving tomorrow
morning returns in two weeks.

33:28.257 --> 33:32.967
Until then, you can stay
and look for the rest of your crew.

33:35.097 --> 33:36.132
Thanks.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.437
Bought us two weeks.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.312
Horace said we can wait
for the next sub.

33:53.449 --> 33:56.486
With any luck,
Locke'll be back by then.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.405
And then what?

33:59.622 --> 34:01.613
What do you mean, "then what?"

34:02.791 --> 34:04.827
Locke said he was leaving to save us.

34:06.629 --> 34:10.918
The flashes have stopped. They're over.

34:11.008 --> 34:14.626
No more bloody noses.
We're already saved.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.758
That sub behind you
brought me here.

34:17.848 --> 34:22.842
I've been trying to get off this island
for three years. Now I've got my chance.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.724
I'm going to leave.

34:32.821 --> 34:36.154
You do realize it's 1974.

34:36.242 --> 34:40.781
Whatever it is you think you're
going back to... It don't exist yet.

34:43.165 --> 34:45.702
That's not a reason not to go.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.203
Well, what about me?

34:50.339 --> 34:52.876
You're gonna leave me
with the mad scientist

34:53.008 --> 34:55.624
and Mr. "I Speak to Dead People"?

34:55.719 --> 35:00.679
And Jin, who's a hell of a nice guy,
but not the greatest conversationalist.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.553
- You'll be fine.
- Maybe...

35:03.644 --> 35:05.760
But who's gonna get my back?

35:13.237 --> 35:15.193
Come on...

35:15.698 --> 35:19.907
Just give me two weeks.
That's all I'm asking for. Two weeks.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.424
All right, two weeks.

36:21.472 --> 36:24.930
- Something smells good.
- Hey there.

36:42.451 --> 36:44.237
Was that for me?

36:46.955 --> 36:49.446
You were amazing today.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.621
Thank you for believing in me.

37:11.230 --> 37:12.970
I love you.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.519
I love you, too.

37:32.459 --> 37:33.790
Wake up, boss.

37:37.965 --> 37:41.583
- How's your head?
- It hurts.

37:43.971 --> 37:48.385
I got good news and bad news.
Which you want first?

37:50.185 --> 37:52.301
Good news.

37:52.396 --> 37:54.011
You're a daddy.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.348
Bad news is you missed it.

37:59.361 --> 38:03.195
Oh, gosh... Amy...

38:03.282 --> 38:05.364
She had the baby?

38:05.701 --> 38:09.535
- It's a boy.
- A boy...

38:16.712 --> 38:19.704
Now how about you tell me
why you were too busy drinking

38:19.798 --> 38:23.711
and blowing up trees
to see him get born?

38:23.802 --> 38:26.214
l was...

38:29.224 --> 38:32.762
l was looking for a pair of socks.

38:32.853 --> 38:38.564
All of mine were dirty
so I went to grab a pair of Amy's.

38:39.568 --> 38:43.686
I found this in
the back of her drawer.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.066
It was Paul's.

38:46.158 --> 38:50.151
- You got in a fight over a necklace?
- I know.

38:51.705 --> 38:52.990
But...

38:53.081 --> 38:55.743
It's only been three years, Jim.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.660
Just three years
that he's been gone.

38:59.755 --> 39:03.373
Is that really long enough
to get over someone?

39:11.475 --> 39:13.682
I had a thing for a girl once.

39:16.063 --> 39:18.270
And I had a shot at her.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.980
But I didn't take it.

39:22.945 --> 39:26.312
For a little while, l'd lay in bed
every night wondering...

39:26.406 --> 39:28.442
...if that was a mistake.

39:30.619 --> 39:31.904
Wondering if...

39:33.413 --> 39:35.540
...l'd ever stop thinking about her.

39:39.920 --> 39:43.538
But now, I can barely
remember what she looks like.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.048
I mean, her face is...
