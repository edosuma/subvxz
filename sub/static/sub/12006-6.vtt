WEBVTT

00:06.723 --> 00:08.657
Aren't you supposed to
give your hand a rest?

00:08.691 --> 00:11.660
- What did the doctor say?
- That the tendons were cut

00:11.693 --> 00:12.894
partially in two fingers.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.730
I'm gonna be in this lobster claw

00:14.764 --> 00:15.964
until they can tell how it's healing.

00:15.998 --> 00:17.733
We're taking the
wait-and-see approach.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.634
And yes, I'm supposed to be giving it rest.

00:19.669 --> 00:21.636
I've been banged up enough in football

00:21.671 --> 00:23.038
to know you gotta let
your body do its thing.

00:23.072 --> 00:25.741
Oh, on the plus side, I
got a kick-ass extension

00:25.775 --> 00:26.875
on all my homework.

00:26.909 --> 00:28.710
Leave it alone.

00:28.745 --> 00:30.612
Don't make me put you in a doggy lampshade.

00:32.048 --> 00:34.950
Uh, my parents don't know about the party.

00:34.984 --> 00:37.018
They think I cut my hand
on a glass of ice water,

00:37.053 --> 00:39.621
not a beer bottle. And my dad's
walking over here right now.

00:39.655 --> 00:41.857
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, sweetie. You must be Tank.

00:41.891 --> 00:43.859
Sorry I missed meeting you
at the hospital. John Kennish.

00:43.893 --> 00:46.795
Yes, sir, I know. The Royals
haven't been the same since you left.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.964
Well, I appreciate that.

00:48.998 --> 00:50.999
I wanted to thank you
for taking care of Bay,

00:51.033 --> 00:53.001
thinking quickly and
getting her to the hospital.

00:53.035 --> 00:55.670
Oh, I mean, I just did what anybody would.

00:55.705 --> 00:57.739
Uh, no, he was amazing.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.776
So, how's your season going?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.911
We've won more than we
lost, so I guess that's good.

01:02.945 --> 01:05.847
I tried asking Bay what position you play,

01:05.882 --> 01:07.616
but... it's Bay.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.984
Hey.

01:09.018 --> 01:11.887
- Left scorer dude.
- Defensive end.

01:11.921 --> 01:13.789
Yeah. That.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.891
Outstanding. Well, we've
got to come to a game.

01:15.925 --> 01:18.727
- Watch you go quarterback hunting.
- That would be awesome.

01:20.897 --> 01:22.764
All right, I'm outta here.

01:22.799 --> 01:24.800
- Good to meet you, Tank.
- You too, sir.

01:26.969 --> 01:29.037
Wow, your dad's really cool.

01:29.071 --> 01:30.806
If you two want some alone time,

01:30.840 --> 01:32.808
I can totally make myself scarce.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.610
Who'd have thought Bay would
go out with a guy named Tank

01:35.645 --> 01:36.711
and that I'd be okay with it?

01:37.980 --> 01:39.848
I don't think they're dating.

01:39.882 --> 01:40.982
Really?

01:42.118 --> 01:44.085
Why not? He seems great.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.922
Parents don't get to
decide who their kids date.

01:46.956 --> 01:49.758
You of all people should
be grateful for that.

01:49.792 --> 01:52.694
I don't know what you're
talking about. Your mom loved me.

01:52.728 --> 01:54.896
We absolutely have to use this crystal.

01:54.931 --> 01:56.665
Oh, hello, Senator.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.968
- Hi.
- Renzo wants to throw a cocktail party here

02:00.002 --> 02:03.738
to celebrate my book deal.
It'll just be the family.

02:03.773 --> 02:05.574
I think that's a great idea.

02:05.608 --> 02:08.776
Yeah, well, he wants it to be fancy.

02:08.811 --> 02:11.713
I bet you clean up real good.

02:13.082 --> 02:15.984
I was thinking maybe we could
do book-themed cocktails.

02:16.018 --> 02:18.053
You know, "Tequila Mockingbird,"

02:18.087 --> 02:19.754
"Lime and Punishment"

02:19.789 --> 02:22.591
or my personal favorite,
"Last of the Mojitos."

02:22.625 --> 02:24.960
Sounds like fun.

02:24.994 --> 02:26.962
Really? You're not just saying that?

02:26.996 --> 02:31.066
Sweetie, I think that it's a great
idea that you're writing again.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.002
What exactly is it that you're writing?

02:35.771 --> 02:37.005
It's a novel,

02:37.039 --> 02:40.709
umm, inspired by our early life together,

02:40.743 --> 02:42.878
back when you were playing baseball.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.614
Wow. Sounds like a best-seller to me.

02:45.648 --> 02:47.749
Too bad the title "The
Natural" is already taken.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.588
I think you left out a few details.

02:53.623 --> 02:55.624
I just can't blurt out

02:55.658 --> 02:56.992
that I'm writing an erotic novel

02:57.026 --> 03:00.762
based on the sex lives
of his fellow teammates.

03:01.864 --> 03:03.798
I gotta warm him up to that idea.

03:06.736 --> 03:12.050
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:14.710 --> 03:17.612
So, what's his real name?

03:17.647 --> 03:18.813
Miles.

03:18.848 --> 03:21.049
Oh. Yeah, I'd stick with "Tank" too.

03:21.083 --> 03:23.051
I don't know.

03:23.085 --> 03:26.621
Miles is...

03:26.656 --> 03:28.723
I'm so sorry.

03:28.758 --> 03:31.726
I don't know how you do this
one-handed signing thing.

03:31.761 --> 03:33.795
I feel like I'm in a horror movie

03:33.829 --> 03:35.730
where the hand comes to life.

03:35.765 --> 03:39.668
It's fine. I can read your lips.

03:39.702 --> 03:42.837
- Thank you.
- So I guess you're not ripping

03:42.872 --> 03:45.640
the band-aid off with Tank.

03:45.675 --> 03:47.075
I don't know.

03:47.109 --> 03:50.011
He's so different from
any guy I've ever dated.

03:50.046 --> 03:52.948
Maybe that's what makes him perfect.

03:52.982 --> 03:55.550
Tank's a really good guy
and... let's face it...

03:55.585 --> 03:56.952
the last few guys I've fallen for

03:56.986 --> 03:59.554
have thrown my heart underneath a bus,

03:59.589 --> 04:00.722
dragged it for a few blocks

04:00.756 --> 04:02.023
and then backed over it.

04:02.058 --> 04:04.793
Yeah, you deserve better.

04:05.861 --> 04:08.563
Yeah. All I want right now

04:08.598 --> 04:10.599
is a sweet, uncomplicated guy.

04:12.635 --> 04:13.702
Me too.

04:14.804 --> 04:16.938
Here's to sweet, uncomplicated guys.

04:23.713 --> 04:26.815
There is a club for everything.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.584
Anime club, robotics club,

04:29.619 --> 04:31.653
wine and cheese club.

04:31.687 --> 04:33.989
Ukulele club.

04:34.023 --> 04:38.727
- You play the ukulele?
- No, but that's what I love about this place.

04:38.761 --> 04:39.928
I get to try a little bit of everything.

04:39.962 --> 04:41.963
Maybe I am a great ukulele player

04:41.998 --> 04:43.932
- and I never knew it.
- That could be true.

04:43.966 --> 04:46.635
I mean, I never thought
I'd be dating a frat guy,

04:46.669 --> 04:48.803
but who knows? Maybe I'm
queen of the keg stand.

04:48.838 --> 04:50.672
What fraternity is Tank in again?

04:50.706 --> 04:53.842
- Omega Psi!
- Oh, I really like them. They're sweet.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.611
One of them invited me to
that luau they're having.

04:56.646 --> 04:58.880
Oh no, don't worry. Travis
is totally cool with it.

04:58.914 --> 05:00.715
Me and the guy are just going as friends,

05:00.750 --> 05:03.752
and now you and I can hang
out together. It's a bonus.

05:06.589 --> 05:09.658
- What?
- Tank hasn't invited me.

05:09.692 --> 05:12.661
Oh, I'm sure he will. He probably
just hasn't gotten around to it.

05:12.695 --> 05:15.730
He's had plenty of
opportunities to bring it up.

05:16.766 --> 05:18.633
Probably didn't want to ask you

05:18.668 --> 05:20.568
when blood was shooting out of your hand.

05:21.804 --> 05:24.572
Or he didn't want to ask the girl

05:24.607 --> 05:27.809
who had just given him the "I
see you as a friend" speech.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:39.021 --> 05:41.022
So there's this restaurant,

05:41.057 --> 05:44.693
and they have this thing... it's
called a twice-friend onion ring tower.

05:44.727 --> 05:46.661
Wanna check it out?

05:47.763 --> 05:48.997
I have to tell you something.

05:49.031 --> 05:50.899
Hey, man.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.836
So, I got tickets for
the theater on Lancaster.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.971
That's the one with the
closed-caption glasses, right?

05:57.006 --> 05:58.840
Yup!

05:58.874 --> 06:01.643
Cool. Oh, and there's a bunch
of restaurants around there

06:01.677 --> 06:02.977
so we can probably get dinner after.

06:03.012 --> 06:03.978
Sounds good.

06:08.751 --> 06:12.754
Dr. J.'s still waiting on those x-rays.

06:12.788 --> 06:14.989
Yeah, they got misfiled by radiology.

06:15.024 --> 06:16.691
I've been looking all over for them.

06:16.726 --> 06:19.861
Well, you're not gonna find
them in the movie listings.

06:24.633 --> 06:25.800
What crawled up his butt?

06:25.835 --> 06:27.736
Sorry, didn't get that one.

06:27.770 --> 06:29.871
Is it me or does he seem really pissed off?

06:29.905 --> 06:32.574
Maybe it's 'cause he
broke up with Gretchen.

06:32.608 --> 06:35.577
Oh. That sucks.

06:35.611 --> 06:37.979
- Yeah.
- Especially with his 21st birthday coming up.

06:39.782 --> 06:42.717
- Oh no.
- Yeah, I saw it on the office calendar.

06:42.752 --> 06:44.753
Poor guy. I hope he doesn't spend it alone.

06:52.895 --> 06:54.929
Oh! I can't decide

06:54.964 --> 06:57.866
what to wear to Kathryn's party tomorrow.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.535
What are you wearing?

07:00.569 --> 07:02.537
Whatever makes me invisible.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.709
When Kathryn was away...

07:07.743 --> 07:09.844
I saw John kissing Jennice.

07:10.913 --> 07:13.715
Toby's mother-in-law?

07:13.749 --> 07:15.717
I don't wanna get in the middle of it.

07:15.751 --> 07:18.620
- Good idea.
- But if I don't tell Kathryn,

07:18.654 --> 07:20.688
I feel like I'm being disloyal to her.

07:20.723 --> 07:24.559
Trust me. Pretend you never saw anything.

07:24.593 --> 07:26.561
It isn't any of our business,

07:26.595 --> 07:27.962
and you don't know what you saw.

07:27.997 --> 07:30.732
Yeah, actually, I do.

07:30.766 --> 07:31.966
And now I have to go to this party,

07:32.001 --> 07:33.935
and see her so happy and act
like I don't know anything?

07:33.969 --> 07:36.771
I really don't wanna go.
Maybe I can get out of it.

07:36.806 --> 07:38.740
Maybe... maybe I can tell
her I don't feel well.

07:38.774 --> 07:43.645
That's gonna look bad, plus, the
party might be more fun than you think.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.927
Hey, so I think we should do
something for Campbell's birthday.

07:58.961 --> 08:01.963
Snow Creek's not that far
away and they have snow tubing.

08:01.997 --> 08:03.798
What? Is that super lame?

08:03.833 --> 08:07.669
No. It's just probably not
a good idea with his injury.

08:07.703 --> 08:08.937
Oh, no standing required.

08:08.971 --> 08:10.738
You just sit down in the inner tube

08:10.773 --> 08:11.973
and slide down the Mountain.

08:13.776 --> 08:17.679
Campbell didn't just hurt his spinal cord.

08:17.713 --> 08:18.980
He had a severe T.B.I.

08:20.683 --> 08:21.850
Tibia?

08:21.974 --> 08:23.074
Traumatic brain injury.

08:23.108 --> 08:25.076
The impact really did some damage.

08:25.110 --> 08:26.778
His brain is still healing.

08:26.812 --> 08:29.847
Another crash can make it 10 times worse.

08:29.882 --> 08:31.950
Oh, that's awful.

08:31.984 --> 08:36.788
Yeah, so we should find a less
dangerous way to celebrate.

08:37.890 --> 08:39.057
How about cupcakes in the break room?

08:40.693 --> 08:42.794
It's his 21st birthday. We gotta come up

08:42.828 --> 08:43.895
with something better than that.

08:43.929 --> 08:46.698
Like what?

08:46.732 --> 08:48.199
A surprise party?

08:48.233 --> 08:52.003
Yeah, Campbell hasn't really made a
lot of friends since moving back here,

08:52.037 --> 08:54.806
so I feel like it's sort of up to me...

08:54.840 --> 08:58.710
- ... to throw him a party.
- Oh, I love surprise parties.

08:58.744 --> 08:59.911
I know, me too.

08:59.945 --> 09:02.714
I even tracked down a bunch
of his snowboarding buddies

09:02.748 --> 09:04.882
on Facebook and got them
all to road trip out here.

09:04.917 --> 09:06.951
Oh, that's so sweet of you.

09:06.986 --> 09:08.987
Campbell's gonna love that.

09:09.021 --> 09:12.824
But it's the same night as your book party.

09:12.858 --> 09:16.761
Oh. Well, maybe you can bring him by after.

09:16.795 --> 09:18.129
It's his 21st birthday.

09:18.163 --> 09:20.732
Oh, I get it. All right.

09:20.766 --> 09:22.834
Well, have fun at your party,

09:22.868 --> 09:26.871
but just remember: you're
not the one turning 21.

09:26.905 --> 09:28.106
No.

09:28.140 --> 09:31.809
- Understood.
-  Wait.

09:31.844 --> 09:34.112
At some point, we're gonna want to meet

09:34.146 --> 09:36.147
this guy that you are seeing.

09:36.181 --> 09:38.883
Oh. I'm dating Jorge, not Campbell.

09:38.917 --> 09:41.786
Jorge? Who's Jorge?

09:46.191 --> 09:47.925
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.095
Do you have any advice on
how to accessorize this thing?

09:51.130 --> 09:53.064
Like, do I try to cover it

09:53.098 --> 09:56.000
or just embrace the whole
robo-crustacean of it all?

09:56.035 --> 09:59.003
Put on it that says what happened

09:59.038 --> 10:02.106
that way you don't have to answer
the same question over and over again.

10:02.141 --> 10:04.976
If that's the worst I have
to deal with, I'll be happy.

10:05.010 --> 10:07.111
Give it time. Your hand'll get better.

10:07.146 --> 10:09.013
- Yours didn't.
- Well, that's different.

10:09.048 --> 10:11.983
That's after 20 years of repetitive motion.

10:15.888 --> 10:19.157
It will heal and you'll go
back to making art in no time.

10:19.191 --> 10:21.959
Hello. These are for your mom.

10:21.994 --> 10:24.929
Oh great. This is my other mom, Regina.

10:24.963 --> 10:26.931
- Regina, this is Tank.
- Hi.

10:26.965 --> 10:29.767
- Uh, right, the switched thing.
- Yeah.

10:29.802 --> 10:31.135
I should've brought
another bouquet of flowers.

10:31.170 --> 10:32.904
Oh, don't be silly.

10:32.938 --> 10:35.139
No. Do you have a vase?
I can split these up.

10:35.174 --> 10:36.974
Really, it's fine,

10:37.009 --> 10:38.176
but thank you.

10:39.745 --> 10:40.745
This is Kathryn's night.

10:40.779 --> 10:43.081
Come on, you can go give these to her.

10:43.115 --> 10:45.016
It was nice meeting you.

10:46.185 --> 10:48.152
He's so sweet.

10:51.123 --> 10:53.758
So I have the most fabulous idea

10:53.792 --> 10:55.059
for the key art of your book jacket.

10:55.094 --> 10:58.062
It's a baseball with the
stitches pulling apart,

10:58.097 --> 10:59.931
opening like a zipper

10:59.965 --> 11:01.899
with just a hint of man underneath.

11:03.068 --> 11:05.103
- You hate it.
- No, it's not that.

11:05.137 --> 11:06.904
It's just I talked to Lydia today...

11:06.939 --> 11:09.707
and she wants me to use
my real name on the book.

11:09.741 --> 11:11.943
Now you really have to tell John the truth.

11:11.977 --> 11:13.911
- I'm going to.
- You'd better hurry.

11:13.946 --> 11:16.881
Lydia says they're so excited
that they want to fast track this.

11:16.915 --> 11:18.883
- You talked to her?
- I was nosy.

11:18.917 --> 11:22.954
Get to it. You don't want John to
find out about this in a press release.

11:22.988 --> 11:25.123
Yo, mom!

11:26.925 --> 11:28.726
Hey, mom, we're here!

11:28.760 --> 11:30.728
Oh, hi, honey.

11:30.762 --> 11:32.096
Whoa! Someone's been shopping

11:32.131 --> 11:33.865
in a whole different part of town.

11:33.899 --> 11:35.733
- You like?
- You look great, mom.

11:35.767 --> 11:38.769
Hey! Oh, hi.

11:38.804 --> 11:40.171
Hey.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.708
Wow. Last time I saw you,

11:43.742 --> 11:45.943
we were battling a
particle-board bookshelf.

11:48.780 --> 11:50.181
Just hope it's still standing.

11:50.215 --> 11:51.716
Yeah.

11:51.750 --> 11:54.785
Congratulations.

11:54.820 --> 11:56.888
Thank you so much.

11:59.691 --> 12:01.792
You remember Regina, right?

12:01.827 --> 12:04.862
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

12:09.034 --> 12:11.002
Jennice, drink?

12:11.036 --> 12:12.970
- I'd love one, yeah.
- Great, be right back.

12:13.005 --> 12:14.805
- Thanks, honey.
- Yeah.

12:16.108 --> 12:18.075
Toby insisted that I come,

12:18.110 --> 12:20.678
and I thought it would be
more suspicious if I didn't.

12:20.712 --> 12:22.079
You couldn't think of some excuse?

12:22.114 --> 12:24.849
John, we're gonna be
seeing each other at things.

12:24.883 --> 12:27.752
I just want it to be normal.

12:27.786 --> 12:30.721
And I wanted to say how sorry I am

12:30.756 --> 12:31.856
about what happened the other night.

12:31.890 --> 12:35.726
It was a mistake and it was all my fault.

12:35.761 --> 12:37.895
You know what? It's fine.

12:37.930 --> 12:41.766
It was nothing. Let's just pretend
like it never happened, okay?

12:41.800 --> 12:44.135
This is just another normal evening.

12:52.110 --> 12:53.911
Mom? What's wrong?

12:55.047 --> 12:58.749
Oh, I've been poisoned! Oh!

13:07.693 --> 13:11.128
Welcome to the murder mystery party.

13:22.085 --> 13:23.979
♪ Welcome to Coddington manor. ♪

13:24.153 --> 13:27.155
The year is 1922,

13:27.190 --> 13:29.090
and on this dark and stormy night,

13:29.125 --> 13:32.961
you are all guests of
the late Lady Coddington.

13:32.995 --> 13:35.897
You are all suspects

13:35.932 --> 13:37.966
in her untimely demise.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.868
Now if you'll refer to your dossiers,

13:39.902 --> 13:41.937
you'll find details
about your new identities.

13:41.971 --> 13:44.072
- Did you know about this?
- No.

13:44.106 --> 13:45.907
Otherwise I wouldn't have cast myself

13:45.942 --> 13:49.110
as Fanny the French maid.

13:49.145 --> 13:52.247
I'm Mabel Flitwit, ditzy heiress.

13:52.281 --> 13:54.049
Well, pleased to meet you, sweetheart.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.018
Lefty Diamond, import-export.

13:57.053 --> 14:00.889
Throughout the evening you will
look for clues around the house

14:00.923 --> 14:03.024
and probe each other with questions.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.894
Now you can be evasive or misdirect,

14:05.928 --> 14:08.997
but you cannot lie as
you attempt to conceal

14:09.031 --> 14:11.266
the scandalous secrets you are all hiding.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.035
Do I look like a silent movie star?

14:14.070 --> 14:17.038
Uh, more than I look like a constable.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.941
Tennis anyone?

14:23.079 --> 14:24.112
Look around.

14:25.181 --> 14:28.149
One of you is a cold-blooded murderer.

14:32.989 --> 14:35.891
And it's your job to unmask this killer

14:35.925 --> 14:38.159
before you become the next victim!

14:50.006 --> 14:52.007
Hey, do you feel like getting some food

14:52.041 --> 14:53.775
that wasn't nuked in the microwave?

14:53.809 --> 14:55.844
Nah, I'm okay.

14:55.878 --> 14:59.047
Come on, ever since you mentioned
that place with the onion ring tower,

14:59.081 --> 15:01.082
I've been jonesing for some fried food.

15:01.117 --> 15:03.785
I feel like we have an
obligation to check it out.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.855
- Aren't you dating Jorge?
- Yes.

15:06.889 --> 15:09.157
Well, then why are you asking me out?

15:09.191 --> 15:12.127
I just meant as friends.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.964
You asked me to dinner on my birthday.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.866
It sounds like a date to me.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.235
- No no, it's not like that.
- What is it?

15:25.274 --> 15:28.043
I'm taking you to your surprise party.

15:28.077 --> 15:30.011
What surprise party?

15:30.046 --> 15:32.180
The one I'm throwing for you.

15:33.883 --> 15:35.984
You weren't doing anything
for your 21st birthday

15:36.018 --> 15:38.153
and I wasn't about to
let you spend it alone.

15:39.221 --> 15:40.989
Who's gonna be there?

15:41.023 --> 15:44.893
Well, it was supposed to be a surprise,

15:44.927 --> 15:47.262
a bunch of your buddies from Colorado...

15:47.296 --> 15:51.800
Chris, Geezer and some dude named Crowbar.

15:53.903 --> 15:55.804
They're coming here?

15:56.973 --> 15:59.040
That's right.

15:59.075 --> 16:02.811
I haven't seen those
guys since the hospital.

16:02.845 --> 16:06.781
And you put this together?

16:07.817 --> 16:09.985
Yeah.

16:10.019 --> 16:10.986
Come on.

16:16.258 --> 16:18.193
So, Lefty,

16:18.227 --> 16:20.962
the poisoned wine that
Lady Coddington drank,

16:20.997 --> 16:22.263
it was a gift from you.

16:22.298 --> 16:25.900
I'm thinking you made her
an offer and she refused.

16:25.935 --> 16:27.102
What are you getting at, doll?

16:27.136 --> 16:29.938
Well, I drank from the same wine bottle

16:29.972 --> 16:31.172
as Lady Coddington before...

16:31.207 --> 16:33.174
which is insane by the way,

16:33.209 --> 16:35.243
because in round two we're gonna
find out I'm secretly pregnant.

16:35.277 --> 16:37.212
I read ahead.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.815
... So why am I not dead too?

16:40.850 --> 16:43.084
How about we ask Fanny
the maid, sweetheart?

16:43.119 --> 16:44.886
Whoa, are you accusing my
mom of being the killer?

16:44.920 --> 16:46.287
How do I know you're not the killer?

16:46.322 --> 16:48.056
Oh, 'cause I'd tell you
if I was, so we could do

16:48.090 --> 16:50.058
an awesome Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.960
Oh. How sweet...

16:51.994 --> 16:53.928
And not at all disturbing.

16:53.963 --> 16:56.097
This is awesome. I'm having a total blast.

16:56.132 --> 17:00.135
Yeah. We should do
something just as awesome.

17:00.169 --> 17:04.105
- On Saturday night.
- Yeah, Saturday is bad for me.

17:04.140 --> 17:08.076
- Oh? What you doing?
- Stupid pledge thing.

17:08.109 --> 17:11.813
But we should do something
Friday or Sunday or both.

17:11.847 --> 17:14.182
Sure.

17:25.027 --> 17:26.994
Surprise!

17:27.029 --> 17:29.798
He's legal.

17:29.832 --> 17:32.867
Crowbar, man. And Chris.

17:32.902 --> 17:35.036
- What's up?
- Now I know this is

17:35.071 --> 17:36.971
your first ever drink of alcohol,

17:37.006 --> 17:39.207
but I'm still gonna have to see some I.D.

17:41.043 --> 17:42.844
My wallet's in my back pocket,

17:42.878 --> 17:45.246
and while you're back
there, you can kiss my ass.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.948
All right, tell the truth, man.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.016
Were you really surprised?

17:52.955 --> 17:57.859
Totally. Dude, I can't
believe you guys are here.

17:57.893 --> 18:00.862
Really appreciate you
tracking us down for this.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.964
Oh, I'm just glad you could all make it.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.807
Gretchen, hey.

18:12.842 --> 18:13.942
Happy Birthday.

18:24.253 --> 18:28.123
Dash Gundson, what are you looking for?

18:29.258 --> 18:31.025
At today's tennis lesson,

18:31.060 --> 18:32.994
I overheard Lady Coddington say

18:33.028 --> 18:35.230
say she was changing her will.

18:35.264 --> 18:38.199
Maybe there's someone she
wanted to cut out of it.

18:38.234 --> 18:41.136
Yes, someone who wasn't
too happy about that.

18:41.170 --> 18:42.837
I figured this is where she would keep it.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.173
Outstanding notion.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.809
You check the drawers,
I'll check the bookcase.

18:54.150 --> 18:55.884
Aha!

18:55.918 --> 18:58.920
What have we here?

19:08.063 --> 19:09.097
Is that the will?

19:10.266 --> 19:13.134
No. No, it's not.

19:20.003 --> 19:22.938
Your death scene was spectacular, but...

19:22.973 --> 19:25.074
You should've seen my Lady MacBeth.

19:25.108 --> 19:27.042
They still talk about it in San Juan.

19:27.077 --> 19:29.345
I'm sure. Here's the thing:

19:29.379 --> 19:32.281
You walking around like this
kind of kills the illusion.

19:32.315 --> 19:33.916
Well, I had an idea.

19:33.950 --> 19:36.218
What if we found out that I didn't die?

19:36.253 --> 19:40.356
That I faked my own death
to unmask the murderer?

19:40.390 --> 19:43.292
But if you faked your death,
there would be no murder.

19:43.326 --> 19:45.928
Oh, you're right.

19:45.962 --> 19:49.899
Well, what if it was a voodoo powder

19:49.933 --> 19:51.233
that gave the appearance of death?

19:51.268 --> 19:53.969
Okay, let's talk about that.
Why don't you just be...

19:54.004 --> 19:56.872
You were the one who served
Lady Coddington the wine.

19:56.907 --> 19:58.974
No, I did not.

19:59.009 --> 20:01.310
The only wine I served was to that siren

20:01.344 --> 20:04.179
of the silver screen, Ms. Bellini.

20:04.214 --> 20:07.116
Maybe she served Ms. Coddington.

20:07.150 --> 20:12.087
Now if you excuse me, I
have to go polish the silver.

20:12.122 --> 20:13.923
Not so fast, Fanny.

20:13.957 --> 20:17.259
What motive would Lulu Bellini
have to poison Lady Coddington?

20:17.294 --> 20:21.363
Let's just say that that
silent movie star was

20:21.398 --> 20:26.201
not so silent when I found her
in bed with Lord Coddington.

20:26.236 --> 20:29.038
- Oh mom!
-  It's on the card, honey.

20:29.072 --> 20:31.073
Come on, Lefty.

20:33.977 --> 20:35.978
Bonjour, Admiral.

20:36.012 --> 20:39.381
- Are enjoying the party?
- Actually, no.

20:39.416 --> 20:41.917
I was looking for Lady Coddington's will,

20:41.952 --> 20:45.252
and I found your book proposal instead.

20:45.257 --> 20:47.091
I was gonna talk to you about that.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.260
Kathryn, are you out of your mind?

20:49.294 --> 20:53.063
We are talking about intimate
details of our friends' lives.

20:53.098 --> 20:54.965
I'm not using real names.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.133
You're using our name!

20:56.167 --> 20:57.801
The rest people can figure out!

20:57.836 --> 20:59.036
It's a work of fiction.

20:59.070 --> 21:01.005
Really? 'Cause a lot of what I was reading

21:01.039 --> 21:02.907
sounded very familiar.

21:02.941 --> 21:04.808
So they speculate.

21:04.843 --> 21:06.243
As long as they buy the book.

21:06.278 --> 21:08.245
Is that all you care
about? Haven't we suffered

21:08.280 --> 21:10.814
enough public embarrassment
with the whole Daphne thing?

21:10.849 --> 21:13.017
And now we're gonna throw this
gasoline on the fire as well?

21:13.051 --> 21:14.184
And by the way, wouldn't it have been nice

21:14.219 --> 21:16.287
if you had asked me if
I was okay with this?

21:16.321 --> 21:19.857
So now I need your permission?

21:19.891 --> 21:22.293
Our kids are gonna read this Kathryn.

21:22.327 --> 21:24.061
What the hell are they gonna think?

21:24.095 --> 21:26.263
Hopefully they'll be happy
that their mother is making

21:26.298 --> 21:29.199
a successful career for herself.

21:29.234 --> 21:33.237
Is this honestly the only
thing you can write about?

21:33.305 --> 21:35.139
I tried.

21:36.174 --> 21:38.242
I pitched parenting memoirs,

21:38.276 --> 21:40.210
cookbooks, "40 in your 40s"...

21:40.245 --> 21:42.046
they were all rejected.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.949
Do you have any idea
how depressing that is?

21:44.983 --> 21:47.084
And now some people are very excited

21:47.118 --> 21:49.186
about an idea of mine.

21:50.255 --> 21:51.789
Great.

21:52.824 --> 21:53.958
I hope it's worth it.

22:07.872 --> 22:10.975
Ah. Constable, I've been looking for you.

22:12.043 --> 22:13.811
- Actually...
- You have racked up

22:13.845 --> 22:15.245
an awful lot of gambling debts,

22:15.280 --> 22:18.182
debts Lady Coddington agreed to pay.

22:18.216 --> 22:20.150
Actually, I wanted to talk to you...

22:21.319 --> 22:25.055
About your relationship

22:25.090 --> 22:26.957
with the Admiral.

22:26.992 --> 22:29.960
I think you mean Lord Coddington.

22:29.995 --> 22:31.261
No, I mean the Admiral.

22:31.296 --> 22:33.831
God! Am I banging him too?

22:33.865 --> 22:35.299
I must've missed it.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.267
I really get around, don't I?

22:39.204 --> 22:40.904
I'm talking about John.

22:42.173 --> 22:44.174
I saw you two in the living room

22:44.209 --> 22:45.843
when Kathryn was in New York.

22:47.045 --> 22:50.014
Regina, I don't know what
you think you saw, but...

22:50.048 --> 22:51.849
I don't know who started it,

22:51.883 --> 22:53.817
but as the single person in the equation,

22:53.852 --> 22:55.052
you need to be the one to back off.

23:05.864 --> 23:06.997
Oh hey, Gretchen.

23:07.032 --> 23:09.266
I hope you don't mind
me crashing your party.

23:09.300 --> 23:12.002
Chris said that I should come along,

23:12.037 --> 23:13.871
and we all go way back, so...

23:13.905 --> 23:16.240
Oh, not... not at all. It's fine.

23:16.274 --> 23:19.043
Besides, it's not my party, anyway.

23:19.077 --> 23:21.945
- It's Campbell's.
- Well, it's nice of you to put this together,

23:21.980 --> 23:23.947
getting all of our friends here,

23:23.982 --> 23:27.017
especially since you've only
known Campbell a little while.

23:28.153 --> 23:29.953
Well, it's a big birthday,

23:29.988 --> 23:32.122
so I'm just glad everyone could be here.

23:32.157 --> 23:35.092
No, you're... you're sweet.

23:35.126 --> 23:37.227
I can see what he sees in you.

23:47.305 --> 23:50.908
No clues in here.

23:53.211 --> 23:57.047
I wonder what we're gonna do.

23:57.082 --> 23:59.149
I know.

24:09.994 --> 24:11.161
What's wrong?

24:11.196 --> 24:13.864
Nothing.

24:13.898 --> 24:16.867
I mean, this... you know, you and me...

24:16.901 --> 24:19.136
- is awesome. It just...
- I know.

24:19.170 --> 24:20.938
I... I told you I wasn't interested

24:20.972 --> 24:22.840
and now I'm attacking you.

24:22.874 --> 24:25.809
No. No no, I love the attacking thing.

24:25.844 --> 24:28.045
Good, because I'm interested.

24:28.079 --> 24:30.280
That works for me.

24:30.315 --> 24:33.250
- Wanna go back to kissing?
- Yeah.

24:39.290 --> 24:41.892
Wow. We get better with practice.

24:41.926 --> 24:45.863
Yeah. I've kinda been waiting
to do this for a long time.

24:48.933 --> 24:51.768
Then why haven't you invited
me to the fraternity party?

24:51.803 --> 24:53.804
The wha... what?

24:53.838 --> 24:57.774
The luau. I mean, were you
planning on inviting me?

24:57.809 --> 25:01.011
It's gonna be lame.

25:01.045 --> 25:04.014
- You really wouldn't enjoy it.
- You wanna take somebody else.

25:04.048 --> 25:07.818
No. No no no, it's nothing like that.

25:07.852 --> 25:08.986
Then what is it?

25:11.956 --> 25:14.158
How do you even know
about that stupid luau?

25:14.192 --> 25:17.161
My friend Mary Beth got asked
by somebody in your frat.

25:17.195 --> 25:18.962
I thought it'd be fun
if we all went together.

25:18.997 --> 25:21.165
No no, you two should do
something else that night.

25:21.199 --> 25:24.134
Why?

25:24.169 --> 25:26.870
Umm...

25:26.905 --> 25:29.206
Okay, you are acting really weird.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.974
Why don't you want us to go to that party?

25:31.009 --> 25:34.211
I can't say, okay?

25:34.245 --> 25:35.979
Tank.

25:38.249 --> 25:41.084
- It's a dogfight.
- A what?

25:41.119 --> 25:43.187
It's a contest between
a bunch of the brothers

25:43.221 --> 25:45.856
to see who can bring the...

25:46.891 --> 25:48.225
the ugliest date.

25:57.069 --> 25:58.298
Make a wish.

25:59.653 --> 26:02.622
Yeah!

26:02.656 --> 26:05.759
Let's dissect this bad boy.

26:07.028 --> 26:08.995
Hey, you made it!

26:09.030 --> 26:11.598
Wow, this is really something.

26:13.100 --> 26:16.836
- Who are those people?
- Oh, they're his buddies from Colorado.

26:16.871 --> 26:18.738
They drove 10 hours to be here.

26:18.773 --> 26:20.607
Wow. You really went all out.

26:22.743 --> 26:24.010
Ah, this is nothing.

26:24.045 --> 26:25.745
Wait till you see what
I do for your birthday.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.973
_

26:34.975 --> 26:38.625
I'm guessing you did a search
on how to impress deaf chicks.

26:38.659 --> 26:41.795
No. I started taking a
few lessons last week.

26:42.812 --> 26:46.378
_

26:46.380 --> 26:48.981
I'm pretty sure that
means a yes on the drink.

26:49.016 --> 26:51.050
- Yes.
- I'll be back.

26:54.088 --> 26:56.155
- Happy Birthday, buddy!
- We got something for ya.

26:56.190 --> 26:59.959
- Thanks. What the hell is it?
- Happy Birthday!

26:59.993 --> 27:01.894
- Check it out!
- It's an adaptive snowboard.

27:01.929 --> 27:04.997
We all chipped in, had
this bad boy made for you.

27:05.032 --> 27:07.100
Gotta get you back on
the slopes carving again.

27:07.134 --> 27:10.002
- How the hell do you ride it?
- Well, the wheels are for stability,

27:10.037 --> 27:12.872
- keeps you from tipping over.
- Shouldn't take you too long to get used to it.

27:12.906 --> 27:16.175
Just lean to the turns,
ice and gravity do the rest.

27:16.210 --> 27:19.879
Guys, this is awesome.

27:19.913 --> 27:21.347
I can't wait to try it.

27:21.382 --> 27:23.082
You don't have to wait too long

27:23.117 --> 27:25.351
we got a van that's gassed up
and pointed toward the rockies.

27:25.386 --> 27:27.353
Leave tonight and we can be there by dawn.

27:27.388 --> 27:30.256
Oh, we're so going.

27:30.290 --> 27:32.358
That's right, we are.

27:32.393 --> 27:34.026
Oh yeah.

27:36.130 --> 27:38.898
We can't let him get on that thing.

27:38.932 --> 27:41.033
I don't think you can stop him.

27:41.068 --> 27:43.269
This is the happiest I've
seen him since his accident.

27:43.303 --> 27:46.172
No, I don't think you understand.
If he has another impact,

27:46.206 --> 27:48.107
- his brain could...
- Oh no, I understand everything.

27:48.142 --> 27:53.012
I was there for the crash. I was with
him for every step of his recovery.

27:53.046 --> 27:55.047
The one thing that's gotten
him through all of this

27:55.082 --> 27:56.883
is the hope that he'll get back out there.

27:56.917 --> 27:58.217
Now you wanna take that away from him?

27:58.252 --> 28:01.921
It's just too big of a risk.

28:01.955 --> 28:03.956
Clearly, you don't know him very well.

28:14.968 --> 28:16.936
John knows about my book proposal.

28:16.970 --> 28:18.971
- Did you tell him?
- No, he found it.

28:19.006 --> 28:22.975
He thinks I'm humiliating
myself and my family.

28:23.010 --> 28:26.078
Honey, you're not humiliating anybody.

28:26.113 --> 28:28.080
I gave up so much for his career.

28:28.115 --> 28:29.348
I'm not gonna give this up.

28:29.383 --> 28:31.984
He'll come around, and if he doesn't...

28:33.053 --> 28:34.120
you could always murder him.

28:37.124 --> 28:40.159
If you pardon me, I have to go hide this...

28:40.194 --> 28:42.962
- The bar. 
- That's my little cold-blooded killer.

28:42.996 --> 28:45.131
Ooh la la!

28:49.169 --> 28:52.271
- That's disgusting
- I agree with you,

28:52.306 --> 28:54.307
and I would never be a part of it.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.275
But you're gonna stand by

28:56.310 --> 28:58.978
and let your brothers
humiliate my friend Mary Beth...

28:59.012 --> 29:00.947
who, for the record, is very pretty...

29:00.981 --> 29:02.148
just because she's not a size zero.

29:02.182 --> 29:03.950
The girls aren't supposed to find out.

29:03.984 --> 29:05.284
Oh. That makes it okay?

29:05.319 --> 29:08.020
No. Of course not.

29:08.055 --> 29:10.957
Look, believe me, I think it's sick.

29:10.991 --> 29:13.125
You'd better pray that
Mary Beth doesn't let

29:13.160 --> 29:15.161
her brother's army buddies
find out about this,

29:15.195 --> 29:17.263
because they will order an
air strike on your frat house.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.965
Hey, you can't tell her.

29:18.999 --> 29:22.034
Tell her not to go, but make up a reason.

29:22.069 --> 29:23.970
Oh, I'm telling her the truth.

29:24.004 --> 29:26.105
- You can't.
- Why not?

29:26.139 --> 29:27.974
'Cause I'm not supposed to say anything.

29:28.008 --> 29:30.076
If the brothers find out I told you,

29:30.110 --> 29:32.979
- I'm gonna be blackballed.
- Well, not if you quit first.

29:33.013 --> 29:34.146
I can't do that!

29:35.315 --> 29:39.218
Look, my dad was an Omega Psi...

29:39.253 --> 29:42.288
and most of the football
team, and most of my friends

29:43.457 --> 29:45.391
Look, it's not all the brothers, okay?

29:45.425 --> 29:47.193
There are good guys there too.

29:47.227 --> 29:49.328
Just the ones who are too
afraid to take a stand.

29:49.363 --> 29:52.131
- No, it's not that simple.
- It is for me,

29:52.165 --> 29:55.334
because I'm not gonna be with
someone who's in that fraternity.

30:10.951 --> 30:12.919
Aren't you supposed to be dead,

30:12.953 --> 30:13.986
Lady Coddington?

30:14.021 --> 30:16.355
I am Ezmerelda, her twin sister.

30:16.390 --> 30:18.090
O... oh.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.997
- Regina knows.
-  What?!

30:25.032 --> 30:26.399
Apparently she saw us the other night.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.134
- You mean the...
- Yes.

30:28.168 --> 30:29.368
Did you tell her it was a mistake?

30:29.403 --> 30:31.170
She didn't really give me a chance.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.105
I... this is unbelievable!

30:33.140 --> 30:35.341
- Do you think she'll tell Kathryn?
- I don't know!

30:35.375 --> 30:37.977
What if Toby and Nikki find out?

30:38.011 --> 30:39.145
I don't... ugh. Look,

30:39.179 --> 30:42.014
go back to the party, I'll find Regina,

30:42.049 --> 30:45.251
and I will convince
her not to tell Kathryn.

30:45.285 --> 30:46.953
Okay? Just... go.

31:07.036 --> 31:09.070
You can't go with those guys.

31:09.105 --> 31:11.639
Yeah. I can.

31:11.674 --> 31:13.808
Your brain is still vulnerable.

31:13.843 --> 31:15.643
Dr. J. would never sign off on this.

31:15.678 --> 31:17.679
Good thing I'm not
asking for his permission.

31:17.713 --> 31:20.815
Come one, man. I know doc told
you about second-impact syndrome.

31:20.850 --> 31:24.018
Even a slight hit, your brain
could swell up and that could be it.

31:24.053 --> 31:26.821
I'm not going on a half-pipe.

31:26.856 --> 31:29.090
Look at this thing. It's a glorified sled.

31:29.125 --> 31:31.025
You could end up a vegetable, okay?

31:31.060 --> 31:33.762
Is that what you want?
One fall and your whole...

31:33.796 --> 31:36.030
I could fall getting into my car.

31:36.065 --> 31:37.699
I could fall in the shower.

31:37.733 --> 31:39.033
Should I just not do any of those things?

31:39.068 --> 31:41.102
That is not the same thing and you know it.

31:41.137 --> 31:43.938
If I can't do what I love...

31:43.973 --> 31:47.675
I might as well be a vegetable.

31:47.710 --> 31:49.677
Why is it all or nothing with you?

31:49.712 --> 31:52.947
It's my decision and it doesn't affect you.

31:52.982 --> 31:55.049
It does affect me! I care about you!

31:58.621 --> 32:02.891
Look, I just don't want
to see you get hurt, okay?

32:02.925 --> 32:05.827
I appreciate what you're trying to do...

32:06.862 --> 32:07.829
but...

32:08.931 --> 32:10.698
I'm going.

32:10.733 --> 32:14.035
Campbell! Come on!

32:32.855 --> 32:34.055
I'm sorry.

32:35.825 --> 32:38.927
What a bunch of d-bags.

32:44.733 --> 32:47.702
Should I not have told you? I thought
that it'd be better to know and...

32:47.736 --> 32:48.870
I'm glad you did.

32:50.840 --> 32:52.774
Are all guys like this?

32:53.976 --> 32:55.977
So obsessed with looks and...

32:57.046 --> 32:59.681
secretly cruel?

32:59.715 --> 33:00.815
Of course not.

33:02.051 --> 33:04.018
I don't think so.

33:08.624 --> 33:11.726
Certainly not your smoking hot boyfriend.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.629
You're right.

33:15.798 --> 33:17.966
My smoking hot boyfriend is not like that.

33:19.802 --> 33:21.870
We just need to find
a guy like him for you.

33:21.904 --> 33:23.671
Yeah.

33:25.941 --> 33:27.675
You know what?

33:27.710 --> 33:30.044
You should've seen the guy
who asked me to that thing.

33:30.079 --> 33:31.946
He was totally hot...

33:31.981 --> 33:34.716
if you're into beer guts and unibrows.

33:36.085 --> 33:37.919
If he really wanted to win that contest,

33:37.953 --> 33:39.988
he should bring himself as his date.

33:40.022 --> 33:41.890
Oh.

33:46.128 --> 33:49.664
I know all about your tennis lessons

33:49.698 --> 33:50.965
with Mabel Flitwit.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.868
Yes, Mabel is making
quite a bit of progress.

33:53.903 --> 33:58.039
I hear we'll see the
results in nine months.

33:58.073 --> 34:00.675
You are the father of
her child, are you not?

34:00.709 --> 34:02.911
Are we seriously playing
the incest card here?

34:03.946 --> 34:04.979
Renzo, I'm sorry.

34:05.014 --> 34:06.881
I have to cut the evening short, okay?

34:06.916 --> 34:08.882
Uh, everybody!

34:08.918 --> 34:11.786
Everybody come in here now!

34:20.929 --> 34:23.797
Uh...

34:23.831 --> 34:25.600
I poisoned Lady Coddington.

34:25.634 --> 34:27.635
- But we've just started.
- So that's it?

34:28.704 --> 34:30.772
Aren't we supposed to guess that?

34:30.806 --> 34:33.875
Sweetie, we've got some
more clues to do here.

34:33.909 --> 34:37.679
Well, the mystery's solved,
so we can all go home...

34:37.713 --> 34:41.081
Or... we... we're home,
so let's just go to bed.

34:41.116 --> 34:43.885
'Cause I'm really tired and...

34:45.054 --> 34:46.920
Thank you for having me, Kathryn, and...

34:46.956 --> 34:49.891
Just go, Jennice. Get out!

34:51.060 --> 34:52.994
Mom, what are you doing?

34:57.032 --> 34:59.734
Does someone wanna tell
me what's going on here?

35:06.775 --> 35:08.643
I kissed your father.

35:23.532 --> 35:25.666
We're not connecting, John.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.835
We haven't been in a long
time, and please don't tell me

35:27.869 --> 35:30.438
- I'm the only one seeing that.
- Fine, okay, we've been through

35:30.472 --> 35:32.606
a lot lately, okay? All
couples go through this.

35:32.641 --> 35:35.409
No, I'm not gonna let
you chalk this up to that!

35:35.444 --> 35:37.645
Kathryn, the kiss didn't mean anything.

35:37.679 --> 35:39.847
Well, that makes it all better!

35:39.881 --> 35:41.682
Oh, come on. It was a mistake, all right?

35:41.716 --> 35:43.851
We were drinking, you were out of town.

35:43.885 --> 35:45.519
Oh, so now it's all my fault?!

35:45.554 --> 35:47.455
No! I am just trying to explain.

35:48.723 --> 35:51.692
- Are you attracted to her?
- No, I'm not attracted to her.

35:51.726 --> 35:55.396
I'm attracted to you.
Let me ask you something.

35:55.430 --> 35:57.731
All the years that we've been together,
you've never thought about another man?

35:57.766 --> 36:00.501
Of course I have, but I never acted on it.

36:00.535 --> 36:03.771
And if I did, it wouldn't be
with someone in our family!

36:03.805 --> 36:06.807
Okay, it was a stupid, drunken kiss.

36:06.842 --> 36:09.610
It's not just about the
kiss! I want you out of here!

36:09.644 --> 36:11.512
Would you calm down please?

36:11.546 --> 36:13.380
Do not tell me to calm down.

36:13.415 --> 36:15.416
I don't even want to look at you right now.

36:15.450 --> 36:17.485
Fine. What, you... you're kicking me out?

36:17.519 --> 36:18.686
You're damn right I am.

36:33.768 --> 36:36.637
You know, there's a reason that
I'm not returning any of your texts.

36:36.671 --> 36:37.705
Just give me a minute.

36:39.541 --> 36:41.876
- Fine.
- I made an anonymous call

36:41.910 --> 36:43.611
to the I.F.C. about the party.

36:43.645 --> 36:45.779
- The what?
- The inter-fraternity council.

36:45.814 --> 36:48.649
The brothers denied it, but bottom
line is they cancelled the party.

36:48.683 --> 36:50.484
It's not happening. Over.

36:51.553 --> 36:52.720
"Anonymous"?

36:52.754 --> 36:54.488
Meaning you're still in the fraternity.

36:54.523 --> 36:56.724
- Bay, come on.
- Come on what?

36:56.758 --> 36:58.726
I'm not gonna de-pledge.

36:58.895 --> 37:02.564
I'm not gonna give up on the
fraternity because of one bad thing...

37:02.599 --> 37:04.967
And I'm kinda hoping you'll
feel the same way about me.

37:06.803 --> 37:08.771
I'm not perfect, okay?

37:08.805 --> 37:10.739
I probably drink too much,

37:10.774 --> 37:12.775
I can't remember the last book I read

37:12.809 --> 37:15.611
and... I suck at apologies.

37:16.680 --> 37:17.846
But I'm loyal.

37:20.016 --> 37:21.717
And if you'll let me,

37:21.751 --> 37:23.852
I'll be the best boyfriend in the world.

37:24.954 --> 37:26.789
And I know what you went through

37:26.823 --> 37:28.857
with your last two boyfriends,
and I would never cheat on you

37:28.892 --> 37:29.992
or hurt you like they did.

37:46.843 --> 37:48.510
Tank, wait.

37:53.650 --> 37:55.884
Don't you wanna know how the
murder mystery turned out?

37:58.621 --> 38:00.522
My mom was the killer.

38:00.557 --> 38:01.857
I read her card.

38:01.891 --> 38:03.826
You cheater.

38:03.860 --> 38:05.694
Told you she did it.

38:05.729 --> 38:07.563
Yeah, you did.

38:10.934 --> 38:11.934
Hmm.

38:14.804 --> 38:16.872
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Yeah, baby!

38:30.820 --> 38:32.521
You decided not to go.

38:33.590 --> 38:35.657
Have you ever been stuck

38:35.692 --> 38:38.527
in a van with snowboarders for eight hours?

38:38.561 --> 38:40.996
Not pretty.

38:41.030 --> 38:44.933
I... I'm gonna go say goodbye to everyone.

38:49.806 --> 38:50.806
Okay.

38:52.642 --> 38:53.909
I'll see you, all right?

38:53.943 --> 38:55.778
Hey, is everything okay?

38:55.812 --> 38:57.980
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

38:59.015 --> 39:00.716
You don't seem fine.

39:02.852 --> 39:06.555
I don't know.

39:06.589 --> 39:08.624
It's not much fun
watching you pay attention

39:08.658 --> 39:09.758
to some other guy all night.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.861
I mean, what's your deal?

39:12.896 --> 39:14.029
Are you into him?

39:21.671 --> 39:24.973
I do have feelings for Campbell,

39:25.008 --> 39:27.576
but I have them for you too.

39:29.078 --> 39:31.647
What am I supposed to do with that?

39:31.681 --> 39:32.981
I don't know.

39:35.084 --> 39:36.985
Well, let me know when you do.

40:03.046 --> 40:04.780
You gotta be kidding me.

40:04.814 --> 40:07.015
State Senator John Kennish

40:07.050 --> 40:09.885
checks into a hotel? Alone?

40:10.920 --> 40:12.754
People start to talk.
