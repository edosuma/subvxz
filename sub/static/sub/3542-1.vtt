00:02.360 --> 00:04.089
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.240 --> 00:07.483
Does Elena enjoy
having both of you worship at her altar?

00:07.640 --> 00:09.244
I've heard about you.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.250
The crazy, impulsive vampire
in love with his brother's girl.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.687
Klaus is a vampire
born of a werewolf bloodline.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.525
The curse has kept his werewolf
aspect from manifesting.

00:17.680 --> 00:21.048
- If he breaks it, he'll be a true hybrid.
- So that's a werewolf bite.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.249
- Tyler Lockwood bit me.
- We'll find something. A cure.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.882
A bite from a werewolf can kill
a vampire, so don't be his friend.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.168
Promise me no one
will find out about us.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.482
Where's Stefan?
He gave himself to Klaus...

00:32.640 --> 00:35.564
- ...to save his brother.
- Just give me the cure...

00:35.760 --> 00:37.364
and I'll do whatever you want.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.364
- You want your cure? There it is.
- Your blood is the cure.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.040
You should have met me in 1864.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.761
- You would have liked me.
- I like you now.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.045
You can embrace what you truly are.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.283
Leave town with me,
and save your brother's life.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.246
That's the spirit.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.848
Rudy.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.242
Rudy! Come on.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.687
It's too hot to make me
come looking for you.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.968
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.770
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, my, uh...

01:24.920 --> 01:28.641
My car ran out of gas a couple miles back.
I've been walking forever.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.441
Yours is the first house I've come to.
I was hoping I could use your phone.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.524
- Don't you have a cell phone?
- Heh. Yeah.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.648
Battery died.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.121
Look, I promise I'm not a serial killer.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.884
I just wanna use your phone.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.731
Sure.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.120
So...

01:46.280 --> 01:47.884
- ...I can come in?
- No.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.287
I'll get the phone and bring it out to you.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.562
I thought you country
folk were supposed to be more trusting.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.969
- I'm from Florida.
- Well, that explains it.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.490
Now, show me
a little Southern hospitality.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.049
Sweet pea.

02:07.200 --> 02:12.650
I bet you $100 that dog ran off
to a house with air-conditioning.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.524
- What's going on?
- Please don't be alarmed.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.682
I'm told Ray Sutton lives here.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.805
That's what I thought. Where is he now?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.807
If I have to make you tell me...

02:36.960 --> 02:40.282
it's going to be
infinitely more painful for you. Heh.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.043
I love it when they run.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.489
He's in Tulley.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.483
It's near the border.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.325
A bar called Southern Comfort,
it's off Highway 41.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.882
Thank you, my love. Now...

03:04.720 --> 03:07.644
may my friend come in and play?

03:07.800 --> 03:10.007
Yes.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.406
Kill this one quickly.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.326
Make that one suffer. I'll be in the car.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.090
Please don't. Please.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.286
Aw. Early. Bad.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.124
It's not early. You're late.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.725
For work. Matt just called.

04:38.880 --> 04:43.090
- Well, maybe he'll fire me.
- Heh. Aim high.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.926
<i>What are you doing?
- Shopping for the party...</i>

04:52.080 --> 04:54.731
- ...you're trying to bail out on.
- I never said yes.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.451
You were never going to.
Which is why I planned it anyway.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.523
<i>My mom wants you to call her.</i>

04:59.680 --> 05:02.206
- Did she find something?
- Animal attack in Memphis.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.164
<i>Third one this week in Tennessee.</i>

05:04.360 --> 05:06.681
And you're sure it's a vampire?

05:06.840 --> 05:10.128
Yes, but that doesn't mean
that it's Klaus.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.921
<i>- Doesn't mean it's not. I'll call her.
- Well, call her on her cell.</i>

05:14.120 --> 05:16.964
<i>- Tell her thank you for her help.
- All right. I gotta go.</i>

05:17.120 --> 05:20.283
- See you in a bit.
- Oh, Caroline, wait, just...

05:20.440 --> 05:22.283
Keep tonight small, please?

05:22.440 --> 05:24.283
Wear something pretty.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.764
Hi.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.881
Was that, uh, Stefan news?

05:34.040 --> 05:36.884
- Could be Klaus victims.
- You're certain Stefan's with him?

05:37.040 --> 05:40.761
Easy to be certain
when the alternative is that he's dead.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.051
Are you sure you're still okay
on the couch?

05:45.200 --> 05:47.043
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.844
You've spent half the summer on it.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.721
- If you need your own bedroom...
- And sleep in your dead parents' room...

05:52.880 --> 05:55.201
or my dead girlfriend's room, no.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.170
Right. Got it.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.082
Hey, Elena.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.122
Happy birthday.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.849
Thanks.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.004
We are out of champagne.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.926
Huh. No, you are out of champagne.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.570
I don't drink in the morning.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.725
- Well, would you be a dear...?
- I think you can probably get it yourself.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.484
I'm not your slave.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.687
Hmm.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.804
- You're dripping a little.
- Mm-hm.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.886
Jeez.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.811
Morning.
- Hey, I was gonna...

07:04.360 --> 07:06.010
Oh.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.369
You heard me.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.841
- You knew I was here.
- You should learn to knock.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.241
What if I was indecent?

07:23.400 --> 07:24.970
Okay.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.250
Sheriff Forbes gave us
another location to check.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.202
- Memphis.
- Another dead end, you mean?

07:33.360 --> 07:35.124
- You don't know that.
- You're right.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.770
This could be the one.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.524
After two months,
this could be the clue...

07:39.680 --> 07:42.843
that tells us Stefan's alive
and living in Graceland.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.446
Fine. I'll go by myself.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.090
And let Klaus know you're tracking him?

07:50.280 --> 07:53.887
- He thinks you're dead. Keep it that way.
- It's a new lead, Damon.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.771
- We haven't had one in a while.
- Okay. I'll check it out.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.810
- If I find anything, I'll call you.
- But...

08:11.080 --> 08:13.242
- Moved down to Tennessee.
- Huh.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.971
That Florida victim
had family in Tennessee.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.122
- Which one? Pensacola guy?
- Uh-huh.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.442
- You up for a road trip?
- Ha, ha.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.529
No can do. I have got to work.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.728
But I can see if I can get you an address.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.245
Mm.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.966
Heh. Mm, mm.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.203
- See you at the party. Ha, ha.
- Get me that address.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.645
You need to come home.
It's boring here without you.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.406
<i>You think you're bored?
My dad's side of the family...</i>

08:44.560 --> 08:48.360
<i>is like wet paint that never dries.
How's the Grill treating you?</i>

08:48.520 --> 08:51.490
It's teaching me the value
of a mundane human experience.

08:51.640 --> 08:56.043
<i>A summer job is good for you.
You needed some normal in your life.</i>

08:57.960 --> 08:59.450
<i>What was that?</i>

08:59.640 --> 09:01.802
Nothing. Look, I gotta get back to work.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.611
<i>- I'll talk to you soon, okay?
- Wait. Wait, Jeremy.</i>

09:05.240 --> 09:07.004
<i>- Is everything okay with you?
- Yeah.</i>

09:07.160 --> 09:10.403
Yeah, normal and mundane.
Come home soon, okay?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.331
<i>Okay...</i>

09:13.920 --> 09:15.729
Ah! Vicki.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.287
- I need you to switch sections with me.
- Why?

09:30.440 --> 09:33.444
- Caroline and Tyler just sat in mine
- So?

09:33.600 --> 09:36.206
So I don't feel like waiting
on my ex-girlfriend.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.810
Something's up with your mother.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.121
Like what?

09:45.280 --> 09:48.170
When I was over yesterday,
she just kept eying me.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.401
Hey, guys.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.045
Did Matt make you switch sections?

09:54.880 --> 09:57.042
- He thinks we're dating.
- So does my mother.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.321
What?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.209
We're together all the time.
It's not a leap.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.330
- Heh. That's crazy.
- Right?

10:11.160 --> 10:15.165
<i>I'm a dead man walkin' here</i>

10:15.320 --> 10:16.367
What's up, Ray?

10:16.520 --> 10:20.206
Hey. Hey, Red. Let me get a beer.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.967
Ray? Ray Sutton?

10:26.720 --> 10:29.530
- Who wants to know?
- I've been looking everywhere for you.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.283
We started in Florida. Pensacola.
I met a young chap there...

10:33.480 --> 10:35.926
who you worked with
before you moved to Memphis.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.323
Now, he directed me
to two lovely young women.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.211
And they led me here. To you.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.362
I think I'll be going.

10:44.520 --> 10:48.650
Not so fast, mate. You only just got here.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.122
Now, your type
are very hard to come by.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.170
I wouldn't do that.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.367
- Vampires.
- You're swifty-swift, Ray.

10:59.520 --> 11:04.401
Yes, my friend here is a vampire.
He's compelled everyone in the bar.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.443
So don't look to them for any help.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.929
I, however...

11:09.080 --> 11:11.321
am something else.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.409
A different kind of monster.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.370
I've got some vampire.
I've got some wolf.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.491
- You what?
- A hybrid, Ray. I'm both.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.690
You see, I want to create more of me.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.287
Now, you being the first werewolf
I've come across in many a moon...

11:28.440 --> 11:30.681
Pun intended, Ray. Heh.

11:30.840 --> 11:34.242
I need you to direct me to your pack.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.369
So where can I find them, Ray?

11:39.640 --> 11:41.324
You can't compel me. It won't work.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.846
Can I get a Scotch on the rocks, please?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.608
Ahem. Tell you what, Ray.
We're gonna play a little drinking game.

11:53.760 --> 11:58.368
Something I like to call
Truth or Wolfsbane.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.810
Oh, this is gonna be fun, Ray.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.325
Elena?

12:20.880 --> 12:23.645
I don't know why you just don't tell her
where we are.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.047
This is a half-lead.
Don't wanna get her hopes up.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.125
Yeah, well, they're all half-leads.
And I'm your accomplice.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.170
What do you want me to say?
I'm practically living there.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.085
- Sleeping on the couch?
- I wait for them to kick me out.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.369
But they don't. I don't know why.
It's not like I'm helping or anything.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.567
Mm-mm.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.323
- It's quiet.
- Yeah, too quiet.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.284
Oh, yeah.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.531
Uh-oh.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.490
- Vampire for sure.
- Stefan for sure.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.766
How do you know?

13:26.920 --> 13:30.686
It's his signature.
There's a reason they call him the Ripper.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.161
Feeds so hard, he blacks out,
rips them apart...

13:33.320 --> 13:36.290
but then when he's done,
he feels remorse.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.727
It's the damnedest thing.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.730
He puts the bodies back together.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.447
- Back together?
- Definitely Stefan.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.723
I feel like I have to fight Damon
every single time we get a lead.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.082
- Maybe he doesn't want to find him.
- Tyler.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.571
What? He's into you.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.124
- Isn't he?
- The only reason Stefan left with Klaus...

14:06.320 --> 14:09.085
was so he could save Damon's life.
I mean, trust me...

14:09.280 --> 14:11.408
Damon wants to find him.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.360
But you kissed him.
Probably screwed with his head.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.284
Tyler!

14:21.440 --> 14:23.283
I'm sorry.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.886
Uh, don't worry about it. Look.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.327
Yes, I kissed him. But it was a...

14:28.480 --> 14:31.370
It was a goodbye kiss.
I thought he was gonna die.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.964
Oh. I just missed a call from Bonnie.
I'll be right back.

14:38.800 --> 14:42.566
Just because I tell you things,
doesn't mean you're allowed to know them.

14:42.720 --> 14:43.881
Sorry

14:45.680 --> 14:48.251
I gotta run
if I'm gonna pick up Sofie in time.

14:48.400 --> 14:52.371
You're bringing a date?
Slutty Sofie is your date?

14:52.520 --> 14:55.410
Hey, it's been kind of slow
in that department.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.724
And...

15:00.480 --> 15:04.246
- ...I am horny all the time now.
- Heh. Yeah, tell me about it.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.961
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.928
It's a vampire thing.

15:12.080 --> 15:17.769
Our emotions are heightened.
We're on overdrive. So...

15:17.920 --> 15:21.049
- It's a werewolf thing too.
- Hmm.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.409
- It's like I can't turn it off.
- Yeah.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.524
Well, I hope you get lucky tonight.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.524
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.680
See you later.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.490
What are you doing?

15:41.640 --> 15:43.449
Covering their tracks.

15:43.600 --> 15:48.322
Clearly, they have no interest
in staying in the dark, but I do.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.206
Hang on.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.642
Huh. Okay.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.970
Well, what do you know?

16:07.640 --> 16:08.766
Werewolves.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.930
Ray. You can end this right now.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.401
Just tell me where your pack gathers
for the full moon.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.050
- I can't.
- I know, I know.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.969
You live by a code and all that.

16:59.160 --> 17:03.051
But see, he's not gonna let me stop
until you tell me.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.249
And I do whatever he says.
That's the way it goes around here.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.685
Hello, Mr. Klaus.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.611
I have some more information for you.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.406
You told me to tell you if I saw anything.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.921
I saw that guy's brother, Damon,
at the farm house.

17:19.119 --> 17:21.009
Well, thank you, Claudine.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.925
You just tell your friends
to keep up the good work...

17:24.119 --> 17:25.963
with the neighborhood watch, huh?

17:29.160 --> 17:32.209
- My brother's still on our trail?
- He's getting closer.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.882
- I'm gonna have to deal with that.
- No, no, no. Let me handle it.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.570
Why should I let you leave?

17:41.720 --> 17:43.722
- Because you know I'll come back.
- Do I?

17:43.880 --> 17:46.167
You saved my brother's life.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.289
I'm in your service.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.649
Oh. It all sounds so tedious
and indentured.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.527
Aren't you even having
the least bit of fun'? Huh?

17:57.240 --> 18:00.687
I'll make sure that my brother
doesn't bother us anymore.

18:13.680 --> 18:18.447
Don't worry, I'm not gonna lose it.
At least, not before the cake.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.683
It's your party,
you can cry if you want to.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.090
Oh, Stefan.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.411
Such a pack rat.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.806
I got you something.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.407
I promised not to buy you anything,
so don't worry, I didn't pay for it.

18:41.560 --> 18:45.167
- You stole it?
- No. I found it.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.484
My necklace.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.403
I thought I'd never see it again.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.407
Alaric found it in his loft.
I figured you'd be happy to get it back.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.961
- I am happy.
- Ahem.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.201
Thank you.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.848
You're welcome.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.484
<i>Can you...?</i>

19:06.640 --> 19:08.563
Uh, absolutely.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.325
Shall we?

19:44.560 --> 19:47.370
<i>I could stick around
And get along with you</i>

19:47.520 --> 19:50.524
<i>Hello</i>

19:51.440 --> 19:55.923
<i>I I I You re all right, but I m
here, darlin To enjoy the party</i>

19:56.080 --> 19:57.923
Happy birthday!

19:58.600 --> 20:01.524
Happy birthday, Elena.
- Thanks.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.882
<i>You should know</i>

20:04.040 --> 20:06.850
<i>I just came to say hello</i>

20:09.800 --> 20:12.724
<i>Hello</i>

20:13.600 --> 20:16.888
Oh, hey, hey, hey. You don't want that.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.487
You want the cheap young stuff,
over by the cheap young people.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.648
You like?

20:25.800 --> 20:29.282
- Don't answer that.
- This is keeping it small?

20:30.840 --> 20:32.808
- What are we drinking?
- Ha, ha.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.526
<i>Hello</i>

20:36.480 --> 20:40.724
<i>It's all right, I'm gettin' dizzy
Just enjoy the party</i>

20:40.920 --> 20:42.763
Where did you get that?

20:42.920 --> 20:45.082
Uh, Henry from the kitchen
sold me a dime.

20:45.880 --> 20:50.408
Oh. So, what's got you
on your spiral downward?

20:50.600 --> 20:52.807
I'm sure it's a lot more interesting
than mine.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.405
You do not wanna know.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.806
How bad can it be?

20:56.960 --> 20:58.849
I already know everything else.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.445
Go for it.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.367
You know I died, right? And Bonnie
used magic to bring me back to life.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.569
- Yeah, Elena told me.
- The thing is, ever since I came back...

21:10.720 --> 21:14.361
I've been seeing things.

21:14.520 --> 21:19.287
- What kind of things?
- Just things I shouldn't be seeing.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.010
What's Bonnie say about it?

21:21.160 --> 21:23.891
No, I haven't told her.
I haven't told anybody.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.247
It's just messing with my head, is all.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.882
I just need to chill out. And so, this.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.561
Yeah.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.121
<i>You're wide-eyed, looking for an excuse</i>

21:35.280 --> 21:38.443
- Oh. Stoner den. Buzz kill.
- Ahem.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.729
- Hey, guys.
- Matt, hey.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.166
- Hey.
- Oh.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.041
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.286
He hates me.
His hatred of me has driven him to drugs.

21:54.440 --> 21:58.331
He doesn't hate you, he hates that
he's not with you. Is that my brother?

22:01.960 --> 22:03.689
Thank you.

22:06.880 --> 22:11.124
I am every parent's worst nightmare.
I am the chaperone-teacher from hell.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.409
- I love high school parties.
- Isn't Andie supposed to be coming?

22:14.600 --> 22:17.046
Ten o'clock broadcast.
She'll be here in a little bit.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.010
- Hello, birthday girl.
- Drink.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.564
Jeremy's smoking again.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.803
<i>- Is his stash any good?
- You're an ass.</i>

22:28.920 --> 22:31.685
Talk to him, please? He looks up to you.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.441
You're screwed.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.041
Yeah. Uh-huh.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.770
Uh-huh. Bye. Uh-huh...

22:43.960 --> 22:46.406
Okay, I am the last person here again.

22:46.560 --> 22:50.121
Enough work, please.
Can we do this in the a.m.?

22:50.280 --> 22:53.363
I have a party I have to get to,
and you have gotta get a life.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.648
Okay, all right, bye. Bye, bye.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.006
Hello?

23:15.160 --> 23:17.401
Not cool, my retinas are burning. Heh.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.131
Okay.

23:28.960 --> 23:32.681
Okay, seriously, who...?
What the hell are you doing?

23:37.560 --> 23:39.369
Hello?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.570
Hello?

24:00.760 --> 24:02.524
Help. Help.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.368
Oh. Stefan? Oh, my God.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.966
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

24:10.120 --> 24:12.566
We have been looking
everywhere for you.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.686
Stefan?

24:35.400 --> 24:36.561
What is it?

24:37.520 --> 24:41.081
<i>Eagle eye, feather-light
Razor-sharp just like a knife</i>

24:41.240 --> 24:44.801
<i>Systematic, post-traumatic
Girl is on the fly</i>

24:45.000 --> 24:48.686
<i>Breathe in, let it out
Taste your heart and spit it out</i>

24:48.880 --> 24:52.885
<i>Facedown in the dirt
Fall in love, she'll make it hurt</i>

24:53.320 --> 24:54.651
<i>The way she's movin'</i>

24:54.920 --> 24:58.367
Since when are they a thing?
- I thought you were ignoring me.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.090
I'm not ignoring you.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.289
You've only said five words to me
all summer. Those were four of them.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.881
Maybe because every time I've seen you,
you've been with him.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.805
Because he's my friend.
Which is what I thought you were.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.485
Aren't you guys mortal enemies?

25:10.640 --> 25:14.167
Isn't that how it works
in the vampire-werewolf universe?

25:14.360 --> 25:17.284
Matt, shh! What is wrong with you?

25:19.200 --> 25:24.240
I don't know. I'm, uh...
I'm out of it, I guess.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.289
Yeah.
- Sorry.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.967
<i>Slap your face and knock you out
Killing's what she's all about</i>

25:30.120 --> 25:31.326
<i>Land mines, warning signs</i>

25:31.480 --> 25:33.130
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.841
- Great party, Caroline.
- Thanks. Now leave it.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.689
- What the hell?
- Ugh.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.250
<i>Got me runnin' out of my head</i>

25:45.840 --> 25:49.049
<i>The way she's movin'</i>

25:49.920 --> 25:52.844
- Andie wants me to pick her up.
- Your fake, compelled girlfriend...

25:53.000 --> 25:55.002
wants you to be
a chivalrous boyfriend?

25:55.160 --> 25:57.401
- Well, it's a complicated dynamic.
- Hmm.

25:57.560 --> 25:58.686
Hold the fort down, will you?

25:58.840 --> 26:01.889
The fort full of my drunk
history students?

26:02.080 --> 26:04.731
Drink more. It'll feel less weird.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.084
This room's off-limits.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.290
- Caroline?
- Sorry.

26:14.440 --> 26:17.523
I just needed to take a beat.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.290
- Are you hiding?
- I was just looking for Damon.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.205
He'd better be here somewhere.
We haven't done cake yet.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.091
I think I'm gonna pass
on the whole cake thing.

26:29.240 --> 26:34.041
No way, no! It's your birthday.
No, it's the dawn of a new day.

26:34.200 --> 26:38.444
You can't get on with your life until you've
made a wish and blown out the candles.

26:39.200 --> 26:43.330
Is that what you all want me to do,
just get on with my life?

26:43.800 --> 26:44.847
No.

26:47.680 --> 26:48.761
Maybe.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.846
I just don't think anyone wants
to see you like this.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.970
- I'm not gonna give up on finding Stefan.
- Of course not.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.009
And you shouldn't.

26:59.160 --> 27:03.165
But you have to admit that you're kind of
just letting your life pass you by.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.005
Isn't Stefan the one
who wanted to make sure you lived it'?

27:06.160 --> 27:07.650
Want me to make a wish?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.885
I just want to know that he's alive.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.725
That's it. That's my wish.

27:19.880 --> 27:25.523
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm just drunk
and dumb tonight.

27:27.240 --> 27:31.290
I don't know, I... What are you doing?

27:37.920 --> 27:38.967
What's all that?

27:40.560 --> 27:45.964
It's Klaus.
Damon's been tracking him without me.

27:46.120 --> 27:47.406
Why wouldn't he tell you?

27:52.360 --> 27:54.124
I don't know.

27:54.280 --> 27:55.361
<i>DAM ON Andie ?</i>

28:01.280 --> 28:03.328
- Party central.
- Where are you?

28:03.480 --> 28:05.767
I'm by the punch bowl.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.651
Don't do that, Damon. Don't lie to me.

28:10.080 --> 28:14.244
- I saw your closet.
- Oh, oh. I gotta go break up Beer Pong.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.765
Wait, Damon...

28:44.880 --> 28:45.961
Stefan.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.560
Hello, brother.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.886
You don't write, you don't call.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.128
I need you to stop following me.

28:55.280 --> 28:58.727
- You're causing some problems.
- With who, Klaus?

28:58.920 --> 29:02.402
- I'm supposed to care what he thinks?
- What you're supposed to do...

29:02.560 --> 29:03.925
is let me go.

29:06.480 --> 29:10.644
I saw your latest artwork in Tennessee.
Walking a fine line there, my friend.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.802
Keep that up
and there will be no saving you.

29:14.200 --> 29:17.921
See, the thing is, uh,
I don't need any saving.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.048
I just want you to let me go.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.647
No, I got a birthday girl at home
who's not gonna let me do that.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.451
You know,
maybe I haven't made my point.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.926
- Hey, Andie? You still there?
- Andie?

29:34.800 --> 29:39.761
Damon? I can't move, Damon.
He told me that I can't move.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.564
No, it's okay, Andie, stay calm.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.762
- Not cool, brother.
- Oh, come on.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.445
It's a little bit cool. No?

29:47.200 --> 29:48.850
Hey, Andie.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.404
- You can move now.
- No!

29:51.600 --> 29:53.204
No, no, no! Unh.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.561
I said, let me go.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.928
What are you doing?

30:34.440 --> 30:36.522
I can't find my truck.

30:36.720 --> 30:40.441
That's probably a sign you shouldn't
be driving it. Need a ride?

30:40.600 --> 30:42.841
You're more stoned than I am.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.961
Ah! What the...? Vicki?

30:50.120 --> 30:51.485
Help me.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.285
Hey.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.484
What did you just say?

31:00.160 --> 31:02.925
- Nothing.
- Did you just say "Vicki"?

31:03.080 --> 31:05.208
As in, my sister Vicki?

31:05.360 --> 31:09.604
What? No. No, I, uh...
I didn't say anything.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.844
No.

31:21.040 --> 31:22.804
What's wrong?

31:27.760 --> 31:29.762
You know what,
maybe we should just walk.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.241
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.731
- Excuse me.
- Unh!

31:38.920 --> 31:40.649
<i>I'm known for taking what I think I deserve</i>

31:40.800 --> 31:43.167
What is your problem?
You're pissed that I brought someone?

31:43.320 --> 31:46.324
Why would I be pissed? You brought
a date. You're dating. That's awesome.

31:46.480 --> 31:50.201
- Okay, should I not be dating?
- Hey, you're horny all the time, right?

31:50.360 --> 31:52.010
I mean, a guy has needs.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.766
If I shouldn't be dating,
all you gotta do is say something.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.446
- If you don't, I'm gonna keep dating.
- What would I say?

31:57.640 --> 32:01.201
Don't do that, Caroline. I've already been
there once with you and you said no.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.600
You shut me down.

32:02.760 --> 32:06.003
I'm not going back there again
unless you make it crystal clear that...

32:06.160 --> 32:08.731
<i>I'm the baddest baby in the atmosphere</i>

32:08.880 --> 32:14.364
<i>Tell me what you want
So we can do just what you like</i>

32:14.520 --> 32:16.170
<i>You make me feel that</i>

32:16.320 --> 32:18.084
- Let's get out of here.
- Mm-hm.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.571
<i>You make me feel so</i>

32:19.720 --> 32:21.688
Hey, you missed the cake.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.365
<i>You make me feel that</i>

32:23.520 --> 32:25.124
<i>Na-na-na, na-na</i>

32:25.280 --> 32:26.964
<i>You make feel so</i>

32:27.120 --> 32:28.645
<i>Na-na-na, na-na</i>

32:28.840 --> 32:30.649
<i>You make me feel that</i>

32:30.840 --> 32:35.402
<i>Get a little closer to me, girl
And you'll understand</i>

32:42.560 --> 32:44.449
What? What are you doing here?

32:44.600 --> 32:47.410
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you keep it a secret?

32:47.560 --> 32:50.086
Can we not do this right now?
I'm having a really bad night.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.447
All summer, every time
I came to you with a lead...

32:52.600 --> 32:55.331
you made me feel like an idiot
for having hope.

32:55.480 --> 32:56.641
You were an idiot.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.170
We both were.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.769
Tell me what you know, Damon.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.488
I know you need to get back
to your party, Elena.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.690
We're supposed to be in this together.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.481
Why didn't you tell me
you've been tracking Klaus' victims?

33:12.640 --> 33:16.122
They're not Klaus' victims, Elena.
They're Stefan's.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.763
- What?
- He's left a trail of body parts...

33:18.920 --> 33:20.763
up and down the Eastern seaboard.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.410
- No. You're wrong.
- I've seen it happen before.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.444
He's flipped the switch
to full-blown Ripper.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.364
- Stop it, Damon.
- No, you stop, Elena.

33:29.520 --> 33:33.684
Stop looking for him, stop waiting
for him to come home. Just stop!

33:34.120 --> 33:36.282
Stefan is gone
and he's not coming back.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.128
Not in your lifetime.

34:10.280 --> 34:14.569
I should go before Elena and Mr. Saltzman
see what a bad example I am.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.563
- Are you sure you can walk?
- We'll see.

34:18.239 --> 34:19.969
Can I take the ice cream with me?

34:28.480 --> 34:30.926
- What happened in the car, man?
- Nothing.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.687
Come on, man, you said "Vicki."
You said my sister's name. Why?

34:38.400 --> 34:39.969
You said you were seeing things.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.208
I've been seeing her.

34:48.679 --> 34:51.206
I think I see her all the time too.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.164
It's because I miss her so much,
like, I wanna see her, so I do.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.366
I know we've got our hands full with
all the supernatural stuff in this town...

35:04.840 --> 35:06.683
but ghosts?

35:07.800 --> 35:11.282
Like I said, my, uh...
My head's all messed up. Heh.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.280
Okay, it's a three-step process, Ray.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.887
This is step one.
I want you to drink from my wrist.

35:29.040 --> 35:33.045
I already told you where to find the pack.
What more do you want from me?

35:33.200 --> 35:36.409
Have you been listening to a word
I've been saying, Ray?

35:36.720 --> 35:39.769
I have great plans for you.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.491
He'll thank me for it later.

35:46.640 --> 35:47.801
There we go, thattaboy.

35:54.240 --> 35:58.450
- What are you gonna do now?
- It's time for step two, Ray.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.161
You're back.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.687
- Did you doubt me?
- Not for a second.

36:06.840 --> 36:10.925
I knew you'd pass the test. You still
care for your brother, for your old life.

36:11.080 --> 36:14.323
No. I don't care about anything anymore.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.602
You put on a good show, Stefan.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.364
I almost believe you.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.602
Let's hope, for your brother's sake,
he does.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.446
You never stop caring about family,
do you?

36:29.400 --> 36:34.361
But every time you feed,
the blood makes it easier to let go.

36:51.400 --> 36:52.970
What are you doing?

36:54.640 --> 36:56.802
I'm not gonna stay here anymore.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.721
What? Why?

36:59.880 --> 37:01.370
I'm not a role model.

37:01.520 --> 37:05.002
You know, I drink too much.
I say the wrong things.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.726
And I encourage bad behavior.

37:07.880 --> 37:11.282
At school, I can pull it together,
but in my own life...

37:11.440 --> 37:13.442
the way I miss Jenna, I just...

37:13.600 --> 37:17.002
I'm really not any good
to anybody right now.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.801
I'm sorry, Elena.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.483
You're 18. You can do all this alone now.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.163
You can do it better without me.

39:51.880 --> 39:52.961
Hello?

39:54.240 --> 39:55.651
Hello?

39:58.320 --> 39:59.367
Stefan?

40:03.240 --> 40:07.529
Stefan, if this is you, you'll be okay.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.730
I love you, Stefan.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.484
Hold on to that.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.443
<i>Never let that go.</i>

40:56.880 --> 40:59.406
Mrs. Lockwood. Hi.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.840
Leaving so soon?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.844
Uh, I didn't mean to be so...

41:04.000 --> 41:05.365
I mean, we were just...

41:07.560 --> 41:11.201
I'm gonna just get my purse, okay?
