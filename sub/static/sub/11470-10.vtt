00:01.800 --> 00:03.165
<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

00:06.560 --> 00:07.721
What did I do?

00:07.800 --> 00:09.643
Two more for me and the spy killer.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.006
What do you want from me?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.650
<i>As we approach the finish line,</i>

00:17.720 --> 00:19.768
I will be stepping back
from day-to-day operations.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.002
You will report to Charlie Isaacs.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.487
Are you ready to start working?

00:23.560 --> 00:25.767
You mean keep working
on implosion with Frank?

00:25.840 --> 00:27.126
<i>Tom... He touched me.</i>

00:27.200 --> 00:29.043
- You have to do something.
- Men will be men.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.009
Was it normal?
What happened between us.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.161
You fell asleep.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.369
<i>If you know who I am,
you know I've spent the last year</i>

00:35.440 --> 00:36.487
<i>working on implosion.</i>

00:36.560 --> 00:37.846
I need detonators.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.763
You don't know me.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.968
- We've created a monster.
- A useful monster.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.530
You remember, you knocked on my door.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.648
And now, 50 of my guys
are working on your problem.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.960
Our problem.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.928
You want me to wait? Ah...

01:37.000 --> 01:39.970
I think you ain't gonna be staying here long.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.089
- No, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.083
<i>All personnel
must stop at the main gate checkpoint</i>

01:48.160 --> 01:49.446

01:49.520 --> 01:52.922
<i>whenever leaving from
or arriving to Los Alamos.</i>

01:53.480 --> 01:57.087
- Can I help you?
- Is this PO Box 1663?

01:57.160 --> 02:01.529
- You got a pass?
- No, but I got a letter from this postmark.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.483
Ma'am, I recommend you get back in the cab.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.967
Else you're looking at 40 miles
of hard road back to town.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.485
My husband lived here. He died here, too.

02:09.320 --> 02:12.290
I'm sorry. No one gets in
without a preauthorized pass.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.801
His name was Sidney Liao.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.246
I don't know anything about that.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.322
I'm not leaving until someone explains
how my husband died

02:25.400 --> 02:27.289
in the middle of a desert
solving physics equations.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.442
Ma'am, you have my condolences, but...

02:29.520 --> 02:33.047
No, turn me away,
and I'm sure I can find a reporter who won't.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.163
Tell them I need to speak to Frank Winter.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.764
Colonel Cox's office.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.085
Oh, right away.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.289
You know what Thomas Edison
used to do when he hit a brick wall?

03:43.360 --> 03:45.044
He'd take naps.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.801
We didn't hit a brick wall.
We hit the Grand Coulee Dam.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.563
Good morning.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.049
Dr. Glen Babbit, Mr. James Meeks,

03:58.120 --> 04:01.727
may I present to you Grover and Earl, is it?

04:04.240 --> 04:06.811
- What the hell was that?
- Apparently, we're taking in refugees.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.963
The maintenance staff has opened
a franchise in our back room.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.247
We're working in the broom closet now?

04:12.320 --> 04:14.561
Well, at least one department's adding staff.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.850
What happened to compartmentalization?

04:16.920 --> 04:19.730
Yeah. No, we are meant
to speak in hushed tones

04:19.800 --> 04:21.483
when the janitors are present.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.006
Apparently, our particular secrets
no longer warrant safekeeping.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.287
Frank's gonna tear them limb from limb.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.567
On the bright side,
we now have a mop on the premises.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.244
Well, you think Hitler's
got Werner Heisenberg

04:30.320 --> 04:32.129
bunking up with a janitor?

04:32.200 --> 04:34.931
Say what you like about the Third Reich,
they do respect hierarchy.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.881
- Frank.
- We've got houseguests.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.247
- Oh. So I heard.
- And you're not upset?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.931
Would it make any difference if I were?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.889
Anyway, you watch.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.928
I'm gonna straighten out
this shockwave problem,

04:52.600 --> 04:55.922
and the custodians will move
into Akley's office, or we will.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.441
You're leaving already?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.365
- Ah...
- We hardly knew you.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.647
I have a meeting across town.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.288
How long has it been
since your husband did that? Hmm?

05:26.360 --> 05:30.285
What time is it?
If I'm late again, the girl's gonna quit.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.841
You don't have to wear
so much makeup, you know?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.530
You're <i>beaucoup plus belle</i> without it.

05:40.720 --> 05:41.687
My mother always said,

05:41.760 --> 05:44.684
"A woman should never leave the house
without lipstick unless it's in a coffin."

05:47.440 --> 05:51.411
Come to dinner tonight.
I'm cooking, Coq au vin.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.522
Will, um... Will Tom be there?

05:58.000 --> 06:04.281
<i>Ch√©rie</i>, love affairs are a reward
for putting up with our husbands.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.363
All the more fun to do it
right in front of them.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.488
We're not having an affair.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.609
You don't have to feel guilty
for taking pleasure in life.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.128
Well, it wasn't much of a pleasure
last time I had dinner at your house.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.931
Your husband put his hands all over me.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.209
What?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.402
Practically assaulted me.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.565
Why didn't you tell me?

06:44.560 --> 06:46.085
I will kill him.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.131
I will poison his dinner.

06:55.720 --> 06:59.850
If I wanted to make a production out of it,
I would have told Charlie.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.129
You don't want to know
what he would have done.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.210
Right away, Doctor.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.448
- In the utility room.
- Right behind you.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.284
- What happened?
- There's been a contamination.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.600
- A contamination?
- Can you lend a hand?

07:19.680 --> 07:22.047
- Of course. What...
- Don't draw any blood.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.766
Does this hurt?

07:46.840 --> 07:49.730
Not a bit. It never does.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.089
Has this happened before?

07:53.200 --> 07:55.282
We need to get these clothes bagged
and out of here.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.362
Yes, Doctor.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.562
Put some gloves on first.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.168
Morning. I brought the kid.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.601
Come on.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.523
My mother told me unwelcomed guests
should never show up empty-handed.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.171
Thought you could use some help
with the contact dermatitis.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.288
Yeah, number one hazard,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.362
working with TNT.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.565
Number one?

08:58.880 --> 09:02.009
- So are we good for today?
- Not good.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.607
But I'll accept your presents.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.603
The war must be won.

09:09.440 --> 09:14.128
We take 32 exploding bridgewire detonators.
We activate them simultaneously.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.289
So you want to know
how to synchronize detonators.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.408
Believe it or not, that's the easy part.

09:19.480 --> 09:24.361
What we have to do is redirect
the shockwaves from those charges

09:24.440 --> 09:28.445
into one perfectly symmetrical implosion.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.522
Thirty British scientists
couldn't do it in a year.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.204
They abandoned their implosion project.

09:32.280 --> 09:36.001
The British are quitters.
Just look at your Revolutionary War.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.565
Drop on three, two, one.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.246
- See?
- What?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.209
Our detonation waves are convex.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.409
They need to be concave
to make implosion work.

09:53.480 --> 09:58.042
You want all these tiny explosions
to turn themselves inside out?

09:58.120 --> 09:59.360
- That's the goal?
- Yes.

10:00.560 --> 10:06.090
Fish swim. Birds fly. Cows shit. All right?

10:06.160 --> 10:08.686
They're each true to its nature.

10:08.760 --> 10:12.321
An explosion goes, "Boom!"
The force of energy expands.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.323
Right. So how do we reverse it?

10:14.400 --> 10:16.084
- That's simple.
- Yeah?

10:16.160 --> 10:18.401
Yeah. You can't.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.490
Judge in his chambers?

10:29.560 --> 10:31.847
- I have no idea where he is.
- Huh.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.081
Well, I'm sure you'll be the first to know.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.561
Could you pass that along, please?

10:35.640 --> 10:38.371
- What is it?
- It's a parting gift from the little Dutch girl.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.680
I just bumped into her in the yard.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.001
You bumped into Helen, did you?

10:43.680 --> 10:45.125
It's Frank's late-night toils.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.487
Someone found them in the chem lab
and gave them to her.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.131
Thought she was still with us.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.726
Did you help Frank
with these calculations?

10:53.840 --> 10:56.366
I had rehearsal. We open Friday night.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.605
Has Fritz been doing
detonation specs for Frank?

11:00.720 --> 11:04.327
Fritz has been waylaid
in metallurgy the last three days.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.722
Remind me which classic
of the stage you're butchering this time.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.771
Uh, Our Town.
I'm playing the William Holden role.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.649
I thought you were just the understudy.

11:15.720 --> 11:20.328
Everyone in the theater knows
the whole show rests on the understudy.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.327
I apologize for the accommodations.

11:42.400 --> 11:47.247
We're not really set up to entertain visitors.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.201
You're not what I pictured.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.321
Well...

11:58.400 --> 12:00.607
He told me all about you.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.365
- Who did?
- Sid.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.201
He never mentioned a beard.

12:07.640 --> 12:12.328
Anyway, I can't believe this is
what it took for us to meet, Dr. Winter.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.844
What else did Sid tell you?

12:16.920 --> 12:22.404
He talked about the others,
Jim, and Fritz, Glen, Helen.

12:24.240 --> 12:29.280
Did he ever mention  what
he was doing in the state of New Mexico?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.806
I didn't even know he was in New Mexico.

12:33.640 --> 12:39.090
Did he ever give you any messages
to pass along to associates or to friends?

12:43.400 --> 12:44.731
Just our daughter.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.326
After your husband's death,

12:47.400 --> 12:50.324
did you receive any unusual visitors
or packages in the mail?

12:54.280 --> 12:56.442
You're not Frank Winter, are you?

12:57.640 --> 12:59.847
There's no one here by that name.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.010
Your parents are watching your little girl?

13:10.560 --> 13:11.846
Yes.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.007
Well, I imagine
Gracie misses her mother very much.

13:16.520 --> 13:20.650
Mrs. Liao,
you traveled a great distance to be here.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.123
Your train leaves tomorrow,
all expenses paid.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.449
When you get home to Oakland,
you will forget all about the past,

13:28.520 --> 13:31.763
and you will focus
on your daughter's future instead.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.762
I'm not going anywhere
until I know what happened to my husband.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.965
And if you were to learn
that he died in a tragic car accident?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.451
Did he?

13:45.520 --> 13:48.171
Or that he sacrificed his life
on behalf of his country?

13:52.080 --> 13:57.371
I need to see his death certificate
and any formal report from the Army.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.480
You're confused, Mrs. Liao.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.927
You think you want the facts,
but that's not why you're here.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.401
You want a bedtime story
to bring home to your little girl.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.448
- You want a fairy tale.
- Excuse me?

14:08.520 --> 14:11.729
I spent a lot of time in China.
You're a tenacious people.

14:11.800 --> 14:15.521
I could give you the brush-off,
but you'd just keep coming back.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.887
This is your husband's file.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.644
It was sealed by order of the War Department.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.890
Your husband was not a hero. He was a spy.

14:34.960 --> 14:40.410
He was shot dead while in the process
of stealing government secrets.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.449
That's not possible.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.525
You have a long trip
ahead of you tomorrow, Mrs. Liao.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.170
Get some rest.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.608
I'm sorry for your loss.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.405
What about
a change in temperature?

15:18.520 --> 15:20.010
Could that redirect the blast?

15:20.080 --> 15:22.890
- Wave refraction might...
- Only the direction, not the speed.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.008
Well, maybe we use
an anisotropic media.

15:25.640 --> 15:29.042
We have to invert the blast, not just bend it.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.009
Please don't.

15:31.800 --> 15:36.727
Powdermen, we work with explosives.
We chew.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.450
You as well?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.525
Sure.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.887
Good. Come on, Frank.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.046
So...

15:52.040 --> 15:53.041
Oh!

15:53.240 --> 15:54.571
Christ.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.689
Is it supposed to burn like that? It hurts.

15:59.840 --> 16:04.687
So the two of you are friends? How?

16:04.760 --> 16:06.091
What do you mean?

16:06.160 --> 16:09.562
Well, he's a man. You're more like a boy.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.764
Thanks.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.446
He's a dinosaur. I'm a plagiarist.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.330
I'm not sure friendship
was ever written in our cards.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.767
Uh-huh.

16:19.840 --> 16:23.083
He lifted one idea, but his paper was solid.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.885
You think this one is smart?

16:27.960 --> 16:29.291
For a boy.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.681
Uh-huh.

16:30.960 --> 16:34.760
Well, I'm done for the day.
You've wasted enough of my time.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.410
We don't need your time, Lazar.
We need your workspace.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.448
Try back tomorrow.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.528
What are you doing?

16:56.600 --> 16:58.728
Your belt is pinching me.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.087
Yeah, we should stop.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.766
- Why?
- Because it's wrong.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.570
"Put to death what is earthly in you,

17:09.640 --> 17:11.404
"sexual immorality,

17:12.599 --> 17:14.125
"impurity,

17:15.599 --> 17:17.089
"passion,

17:18.560 --> 17:20.289
"evil desire."

17:20.359 --> 17:22.567
You think I don't pay attention
in Bible study?

17:22.640 --> 17:25.564
To the words maybe, but not the meaning.

17:25.640 --> 17:29.008
Well, I just don't happen to think
desire is evil.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.686
- If there is a God...
- If?

17:32.760 --> 17:35.240
- He gave us genitals for a reason.
- Uh...

17:35.320 --> 17:36.810
This isn't it.

17:38.880 --> 17:43.124
You know, I am trying to understand
your point of view.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.884
The least you could do is meet me halfway.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.571
Fornication isn't halfway, Callie.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.606
Why are you even with me anyway?

17:51.680 --> 17:53.091
I am beginning to wonder.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.444
What I think is...

17:58.600 --> 18:02.286
I think it's a pretty good way
to rebel against your parents.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.601
Going steady with the guy
who shot their friend.

18:07.160 --> 18:11.085
As a matter of fact,
that's the thing I like the least about you.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.201
Sid was my friend, too, you know.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.850
- Callie, I'm sorry. I'm just...
- No.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.604
Get out of here
before my father comes home,

18:20.680 --> 18:23.160
or he's gonna be the one shooting.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.488
This is awfully public.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.803
Yes, that's why I wanted to meet here,

18:55.880 --> 18:59.009
so there was no misunderstanding
my intentions.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.245
I see.

19:06.680 --> 19:11.447
Elodie, you have been a wonderful friend
at a time when I really needed one.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.443
But whatever you think
is happening between us,

19:13.520 --> 19:15.284
it needs to end.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.405
I'm sorry.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.882
Is this about what Tom did?

19:24.840 --> 19:26.001
No.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.762
This is about you and me.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.286
Elodie.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.130
I thought this dump
felt more cosmopolitan than usual.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.288
Ida.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.964
Hank.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.520
- This is Abby Isaacs.
- Hello.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.762
We're colleagues at the switchboard.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.287
Mmm-hmm.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.441
Pleased to meet you.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.524
Does your husband know
you're out on the town with this minx?

19:53.600 --> 19:57.241
I have half a mind to ditch my husband
and join them.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.369
- Oh. Hey, I finally finished it.
- Hmm? Ah!

20:01.240 --> 20:03.368
Only took me, what, 100 years?

20:03.440 --> 20:05.761
- Well?
- I don't know.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.241
I thought it would be racier.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.368
He certainly set Europe on fire.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.249
I thought that was Hitler.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.526
What's the book about?

20:13.600 --> 20:18.845
There's this guy named Meursault.
He's kind of a pill. His mother dies.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.446
He shoots an Arab,
and he winds up in prison.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.931
On.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.324
It's about the fact that our lives are absurd.

20:28.280 --> 20:32.649
There's no God. There's no morality.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.485
And society invents rules
to keep us from happiness.

20:38.320 --> 20:44.009
But every minute of every day,
you're free to decide who to be

20:44.920 --> 20:46.684
and how to live.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.248
So it's a comedy.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.843
Sounds to me like the author never lived
in a town where you can't leave.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.048
He lives in occupied Paris.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.486
Anyway, you're free to walk away
from this hill any time you like.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.201
I think the colonel might disagree.

21:08.280 --> 21:12.729
Just because there may be a consequence
doesn't mean you have no choice.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.244
Yeah, well, my choice
is to go to bed. Ida?

21:17.520 --> 21:20.922
Would you like to join us?

21:22.360 --> 21:23.850
I'm sorry?

21:24.840 --> 21:26.968
Another time.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.209
- Great to see you.
- Bye.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.364
What was that about?

21:36.160 --> 21:39.164
Well, they're <i>bons vivants.</i>

21:41.160 --> 21:44.960
Usually, they trade partners
with the couple next door,

21:45.840 --> 21:48.366
like an American square dance.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.604
You're joking.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.762
Abby, you've been in the switchboard
long enough to know

21:53.840 --> 21:57.731
that everybody inside these fences
has a secret life.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.007
You're no exception.

22:00.640 --> 22:06.204
The difference is you're keeping the secret
even from yourself.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.205
- Elodie...
- No.

22:10.280 --> 22:14.126
Why shouldn't we enjoy ourselves
while we can?

22:14.200 --> 22:17.602
Life is short,
and it's getting shorter all the time.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.162
What does that mean?

22:24.040 --> 22:26.566
That's why we're here, right?

22:28.200 --> 22:31.409
So our husbands can invent
the end of the world.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.969
You woke up early.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.286
You got home late.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.328
What's for breakfast?

22:50.400 --> 22:51.925
Nothing.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.525
Nothing?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.768
I'm not hungry. Why would I eat?

22:55.840 --> 22:58.241
Because that's what people do
in the morning.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.011
<i>"L'Etranger."</i>

23:04.080 --> 23:05.491
<i>- L'Etranger.</i>
- Oh.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.289
I took four years of high school French.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.285
What?

23:12.920 --> 23:15.651
Nothing. Just... No.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.929
You buy gossip magazines
for the photo spreads.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.611
Suddenly, you're reading Baudelaire?

23:24.960 --> 23:28.009
You're not building a radar system, are you?

23:31.400 --> 23:32.731
What?

23:33.400 --> 23:37.371
That's what you told me
when we first got here.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.965
Is it true?

23:39.760 --> 23:41.330
Abby, it's complicated.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.442
Lying to your wife?

23:43.520 --> 23:46.729
I can't tell you any more. I'm not allowed.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.407
Of course you can.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.723
In every single moment, we have a choice.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.404
I'm protecting you.

24:04.440 --> 24:09.651
By building some machine that could
wipe us all off the face of the Earth?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.848
I'll make my own breakfast.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.041
Why didn't you tell me

24:29.120 --> 24:33.489
you did all these additional calculations
on the detonation specs?

24:33.560 --> 24:34.800
Slipped my mind.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.364
You're working with Charlie Isaacs,
aren't you?

24:38.440 --> 24:41.046
You got him and Helen
feeding you calculations,

24:41.120 --> 24:44.044
stealing Akley's resources
out from under his nose.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.689
Jesus, Frank.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.248
Isaacs came to me.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.961
The plutonium at Site X
will never be pure enough.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.805
Thin Man will predetonate.
It is doomed to fail.

25:00.880 --> 25:04.885
And then they will be forced to help us
overcome the shockwave problem.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.851
No. No, the minute the Army discovers
that Thin Man is useless,

25:08.920 --> 25:10.809
they'll shut us down

25:10.880 --> 25:13.042
and throw all their manpower
into trying to fix it.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.643
So the plan is to put everybody around you
in jeopardy?

25:16.720 --> 25:20.805
The plan is to prove implosion works
before the plutonium arrives.

25:20.880 --> 25:24.362
And when I do that,
no one's gonna give a shit how I got there.

25:26.320 --> 25:29.483
We hit the wall. It's a mile high,

25:29.560 --> 25:32.450
but you're not gonna scale it
by standing on the shoulders of Thin Man.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.646
I have to try.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.081
- And the collateral damage?
- We won't get caught.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.050
This entire Hill was built on secrets, Frank.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.083
They're traded around like ration stamps.

25:44.880 --> 25:49.169
When this falls apart, you'll face jail time.

25:49.240 --> 25:53.689
But G-2 is already convinced
that I'm a Commie.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.525
- I'll face the firing squad.
- Glen.

25:56.600 --> 26:02.403
You put our fate, my fate,
in the hands of Charlie Isaacs.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.922
I've come to trust him.

26:05.600 --> 26:09.924
You've come to trust the little shit
that put the bull's-eye on my back,

26:10.000 --> 26:15.404
a plagiarist,
a rat who steals from other scientists.

26:18.360 --> 26:21.523
I guess that's why they call it the fog of war.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.368
Liza, I'm glad I caught you.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.761
Oh.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.848
Your help yesterday was appreciated.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.567
Every reason to believe the men will be fine.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.564
Just glad I could help.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.086
I hope it didn't scare you.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.811
Those men work with explosives all the time.

27:00.880 --> 27:05.920
The scrubbing was just to be certain
all the residue was off.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.047
I understand.

27:07.120 --> 27:11.682
I just wanted to make sure that
you were aware of patient confidentiality.

27:11.760 --> 27:15.606
You really shouldn't mention this
to anyone outside the clinic.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.444
Of course not.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.560
Punching out?

27:21.520 --> 27:22.726
Yes, I am.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.607
Good night.

27:24.680 --> 27:28.844
Liza, it's been a long day for all of us.

27:28.920 --> 27:32.481
Should you and I maybe
have a drink to wash it down?

27:35.960 --> 27:39.442
Oh, that's so kind of you, Doctor. Um...

27:40.640 --> 27:44.042
I really must get dinner on the table, but...

27:44.120 --> 27:46.771
You know, a wife's work is never done.

27:47.440 --> 27:50.489
- Another time.
- Another time.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.608
G34, please step out of line.

28:08.800 --> 28:12.566
Sorry. You'd think that's a number
I could commit to memory.

28:16.400 --> 28:20.007
Is there some kind of problem?
My pass is up to date.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.401
- You're coming with me.
- Why?

28:36.280 --> 28:40.444
It's just you, Private Dunlavey?
No MPs to hold me down this time?

28:41.440 --> 28:44.250
- Sit down.
- Is this how things go around here?

28:44.320 --> 28:45.731
You get me arrested for no reason.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.280
You put a couple of quiet bullets in me.
You get another promotion.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.169
I just want to talk.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.567
I have nothing to say to you.

28:59.200 --> 29:03.922
You can't tell anyone I told you this,
and hardly anyone knows.

29:05.560 --> 29:09.281
Sid Liao's wife is here on the Hill.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.971
Annie's here?

29:15.480 --> 29:16.527
Have you seen her?

29:17.600 --> 29:21.491
Not myself, but I thought you might want to.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.244
Where is she?

29:23.320 --> 29:27.882
She's being questioned by the authorities,
but she'll be released and sent off soon.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.601
I hear she'll be on the workers' bus out
this afternoon.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.121
Why are you doing this?

29:36.320 --> 29:41.121
"Let us lie down in our shame,
and let our disgrace cover us."

30:26.040 --> 30:27.883
Do you have to do that right now?

30:27.960 --> 30:28.961
Uh-huh.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.131
What are you doing anyway?

30:31.200 --> 30:36.491
Air pockets, drilling them out,
filling them back in.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.562
You're drilling into TNT?

30:39.680 --> 30:40.681
Uh-huh.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.208
- Dispersion relations.
- What?

30:45.400 --> 30:48.370
- You reference them in your paper.
- My paper?

30:49.720 --> 30:54.726
All right, just think
about a wave deep in the ocean.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.330
It's convex until it moves into shore.

30:59.400 --> 31:02.563
Then it turns in on itself, and it forms a tube.

31:02.640 --> 31:06.406
The shallow ground, it works just like a lens.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.480
The shape of the wave
actually begins to invert.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.325
So we need to slow down
the middle of the shockwave.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.004
Yeah, then flatten and invert them.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.323
We use a charge as our shallow ground.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.289
- Is that possible?
- It's like the Munroe effect.

31:19.360 --> 31:23.445
A Navy man at the turn of the century
invented incendiary warheads.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.090
Bazooka rockets.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.571
He called them shaped charges.

31:26.640 --> 31:30.611
But a nuclear core is no rocket.
It's 1,000 times more sensitive.

31:30.680 --> 31:34.605
We just have to find a way
to perfectly mold the shockwaves.

31:34.680 --> 31:39.083
We could vary the burn rates.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.126
Can you make that happen?

31:44.200 --> 31:49.843
Baratol burns slower than TNT,
and I can blend to any speed you want.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.762
Then we would
just flip the shockwaves inside out

31:53.840 --> 32:00.166
and bend them
into a single symmetrical implosion wave.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.123
Jesus, Frank.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.845
Hey, Annie.

32:39.560 --> 32:41.369
Are you okay?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.765
I'm so sorry about Sid.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.366
I wanted to call, but...

32:48.440 --> 32:51.523
- They wouldn't allow you.
- Not even a letter.

32:55.480 --> 32:59.371
Jim, what is this place?
What the hell was Sid doing here?

33:00.360 --> 33:02.442
I can't talk about it.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.884
That's what Sid always said.

33:07.960 --> 33:11.487
You know what else he told me?
That he was coming home.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.489
He died for his country.

33:16.560 --> 33:19.609
They told me he was a spy, Jim.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.808
He wasn't. He never would have done that.

33:21.880 --> 33:25.248
We were married six years.
You think I don't know that?

33:26.480 --> 33:28.482
I'm sorry, Annie.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.406
Would you deliver a message
to Frank Winter for me?

33:36.480 --> 33:37.720
Of course.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.606
Tell him that...

33:41.160 --> 33:43.640
Tell him it's very kind of him
to send the money,

33:43.720 --> 33:47.611
but I don't want another dime
that comes out of this place.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.648
Frank's been sending money?

33:49.720 --> 33:52.371
Every month, ever since it happened.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.967
Tell him he has nothing to feel guilty about.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.691
Why would Frank feel guilty?

33:59.560 --> 34:02.723
Because he brought Sid here
in the first place.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.491
I'm glad you're here. Last time I talked to Sid,

34:07.560 --> 34:12.360
he told me that he was being transferred
to some other secret location.

34:12.440 --> 34:16.001
We all were. The Army changed its mind.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.161
Next stop Santa Fe.

34:19.159 --> 34:22.926
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too, Annie.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.766
I'll get Crosley working
on manufacturing specs

35:32.840 --> 35:34.649
for the aluminum pusher.

35:34.720 --> 35:37.564
Fritz and Meeks can measure
the baratol burn rate.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.604
Helen and I will get our guys
onto the modeling calculations.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.682
This is good.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.725
Yesterday, you said it wasn't possible.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.609
Well, yesterday, it wasn't. Today, it is.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.968
Don't be smart, boy. I was right both times.

35:58.600 --> 36:01.126
Any idea what he said?

36:01.200 --> 36:03.282
Something about friendship?

36:09.040 --> 36:10.166
Good day.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.960
Ma'am.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.445
Hi.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.726
Could you give this to PFC Dunlavey?

36:32.880 --> 36:35.167
You another one of his adoring fans?

36:36.600 --> 36:38.250
We're in Bible study together.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.208
Hey. spy killer.

36:50.280 --> 36:54.285
A pretty girl left this for you.
Said she thought you'd want it back.

37:44.480 --> 37:45.481
Ah!

37:45.640 --> 37:47.802
- Already finished?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.841
What is it?

37:57.560 --> 38:00.564
Do you know why I learned French?

38:00.640 --> 38:04.087
Because it was important to my mother.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.323
Every August, Charlie and I spend
our vacation at the Chatham Inn,

38:07.400 --> 38:11.849
the same place that I've been summering
since I was a little girl.

38:11.920 --> 38:15.163
It never occurred to me to go someplace new.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.483
Well, you deserve to see the world.

38:24.280 --> 38:29.366
My whole life I have been exactly the person
everyone expected me to be.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.125
I don't even know what I want.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.251
What do you want right now?

39:14.600 --> 39:15.931
Lenses.

39:16.840 --> 39:22.244
Explosive lenses, shaped charges.
That's how we do it.

39:25.840 --> 39:27.285
How do you control the speed?

39:27.360 --> 39:28.850
By varying the burn rates.

39:31.320 --> 39:34.847
With baratol. Oh, my God!

39:34.920 --> 39:37.241
- Charlie's fine.
- You idiot!

40:06.200 --> 40:07.440
Liza?

40:10.800 --> 40:12.609
It's all poisoned.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.207
What, our clothes?

40:15.280 --> 40:18.887
Everything, our dinner plates, our silverware.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.281
It's all radioactive.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.561
I work with radium.

40:26.640 --> 40:29.962
Trace elements have followed me home
from every lab I've ever worked in.

40:30.040 --> 40:33.442
- There's nothing to worry about.
- It's in Callie's room.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.804
It's on her shoes.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.331
It's on her toothbrush.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.810
Don't be absurd.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.444
Liza, Liza, Liza, stop. Stop.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.488
I think it's in the air, maybe the water.

40:46.560 --> 40:49.211
This place is poisoning us
and everyone who's in it.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.601
When Callie gets home,
we have to strip her down.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.682
- Okay.
- We have to scrub her skin.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.762
Just calm down.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.320
Calm down and listen to yourself
for a second.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.925
I'll show you.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.604
If you're looking for the janitors
to clean up something,

41:34.720 --> 41:36.848
they all left for the night.

41:39.120 --> 41:44.490
Actually, I am trying to clean up a bit,
but I don't need a broom.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.769
You're Meeks, correct?

41:49.800 --> 41:51.165
Jim.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.845
Pleasure.

41:57.880 --> 42:00.724
You've been here, what, Jim, eight months?

42:03.120 --> 42:06.010
Must be quite a change from Maine.

42:06.080 --> 42:09.721
I imagine your mother misses
having you nearby.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.007
She's been ill, hasn't she?

42:12.080 --> 42:13.411
Do I know you?

42:15.240 --> 42:18.483
I handle personnel issues
in the Manhattan District.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.882
I end up reading a lot of files.

42:21.960 --> 42:26.568
I can tell you the issue here.
We barely have any personnel left.

42:26.640 --> 42:29.928
Yeah, it does look
a little bit lonely around here.

42:31.200 --> 42:35.091
Is your boss in?
I have some questions for Dr. Winter.

42:36.040 --> 42:39.328
Yeah, well,
I have some questions for him, too.

42:42.240 --> 42:46.882
You know, I always like to hear
about things on the ground.

42:48.160 --> 42:54.964
Maybe you'd like to share some thoughts
about Dr. Winter's management style.

43:17.880 --> 43:23.808
It was going off everywhere here
just before you came back.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.005
Come on.

43:37.320 --> 43:39.084
You know, I should never have let it
out of my sight.

43:39.160 --> 43:44.326
You know, the Army could have come
in here while I was outside, or G-2.

43:44.400 --> 43:47.244
You know, they could have rewired it.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.926
They could have rewired it, Frank,
to cover their tracks.

43:50.000 --> 43:56.360
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
nobody has been in our house, okay?

44:24.200 --> 44:26.202
It was working.

44:58.200 --> 45:02.444
They're less than a year old.
They should be fine.

45:06.200 --> 45:16.200
