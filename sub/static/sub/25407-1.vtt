04:10.733 --> 04:16.360
Hey Joel, as Detective Reese was saying I'm
detective Moretti. Nice to officially meet you.

04:16.402 --> 04:20.755
So your current address is
still that 146 Evergreen Lane?

04:21.266 --> 04:22.333
Yes.

04:23.133 --> 04:25.030
You Live there alone?

04:25.034 --> 04:29.323
No It's, I live with my
mother. It's my mother's house.

04:32.980 --> 04:38.760
- I see.
- Can I ask you a question?

04:38.766 --> 04:42.210
- Shoot.
- Why did they try to pull me over?

04:42.212 --> 04:47.462
The Patrolman noticed that your
truck didn't have a license plate.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.610
I've been monkeying around with that
plate all week. Must've fell off.

04:58.108 --> 05:03.851
It's always a twenty-five cent
part isn't it? It's just my luck.

05:03.853 --> 05:07.901
Joel, about what we found
in the back of your truck.

05:07.903 --> 05:09.665
Do you know the girl's name?

05:11.890 --> 05:14.901
Oh, I don't know her real name.

05:16.979 --> 05:22.526
I've seen her around here and there, I picked
her up in Manhattan and took her back here.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.930
Things didn't go so well
though, so I strangled her.

05:29.820 --> 05:31.920
So things didn't go well.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.438
Yeah I guess it's like
that tag on my truck...

05:35.440 --> 05:37.440
It's not my lucky week.

05:39.300 --> 05:43.580
Joel, I get the feeling this isn't the
first time that things haven't gone well.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.260
Yeah you're right.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.940
So tell me, how many victims do you have?

05:53.360 --> 05:57.318
I mean ballpark, more
than one, less than five?

05:57.320 --> 05:59.320
Less than twenty.

06:00.940 --> 06:02.100
Twenty.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.540
It's seventeen.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.378
It's definitely seventeen.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.380
Seventeen?

06:11.740 --> 06:12.900
I guess so.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.900
Hey, do you think I need a lawyer?

06:16.880 --> 06:18.638
Where are you from Joel?

06:18.640 --> 06:20.640
I grew up in Long Island.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.420
Kids at school called me "The
Turtle" because of my posture.

06:39.460 --> 06:43.160
They'd steal my books, kick me
down the stairs, all that bullshit.

06:56.340 --> 06:59.260
After a while I figured out
it was best to keep to myself.

06:59.880 --> 07:04.440
It turned out okay actually,
I had enough to keep occupied.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.940
I liked to collect different types of rock.

07:19.340 --> 07:23.580
Limestone, asphalt, all
types of sedimentary rock.

07:23.880 --> 07:28.240
I'd also collect different
types of wood, special fibers.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.980
I think I got the habit from my mother.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.098
She was a real outdoors type.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.620
She loved gardening.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.760
I'd help her all the
time with her gardening.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.040
That was a big passion that we both shared.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.320
That and photography.

08:15.040 --> 08:20.720
Every once and a while I'd get a magazine
with dirty pictures or see a dirty movie.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.838
You knew your weren't supposed to be
watching but you can't help yourself.

08:25.840 --> 08:29.518
Looking back on it I don't
think they were that bad for me.

08:29.520 --> 08:33.597
When I was really young I thought
those poses were just funny.

08:33.600 --> 08:39.440
When I got a little older, I guess
I started taking it more seriously.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.200
They were just somebody else's fantasies.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.040
Some of them were kind of artistic, too.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.240
Like the ones where the girls
were tied up and punished.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.640
It made me start having my own fantasies...

08:55.280 --> 08:59.920
...I started dreaming about Amazon
women fighting to the death...

09:00.720 --> 09:04.240
...I would decide who would live and die.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.800
These fantasies made me feel real good.

11:24.526 --> 11:27.684
When I got to High School
it didn't get much better.

11:28.421 --> 11:32.210
When I was older they found
out I had a learning disability.

11:32.736 --> 11:36.421
It took me hours to finish my homework.

11:36.736 --> 11:38.420
It really disappointed my dad.

11:38.500 --> 11:44.000
He was a structural engineer with a son who
couldn't pass High School Algebra, humiliating.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.650
I was the butt of everyone's jokes.

12:02.900 --> 12:07.700
I'd be lucky if my head wasn't being
dunked in the toilet or my camera stolen.

12:08.750 --> 12:14.900
I'm taking all the pictures for our yearbook
and these jokers steal my camera, ridiculous.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.500
I wasn't even invited
to the yearbook party.

12:17.850 --> 12:22.300
That probably hurt the most, no respect.

12:34.150 --> 12:38.350
I figured before I went to
College I should lose my virginity.

12:39.450 --> 12:42.900
The only way I knew
that was to hire a girl.

12:43.350 --> 12:46.900
So one night I drove into the
city and started looking for one.

12:58.550 --> 13:01.100
I was hooked.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.950
If I'd known it was so easy I
would've done it years earlier.

13:07.400 --> 13:12.100
It was convenient too. I didn't even have
to leave my car while it was happening.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.300
It was the ultimate pleasure.

13:22.900 --> 13:26.550
I went to the community college
and did some odd jobs around town.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.100
None of that mattered.

13:32.950 --> 13:35.750
I spent every second on the
streets looking for girls.

13:37.300 --> 13:42.300
If I got paid on thursday or friday I'd
be asking be for gas money the next monday.

13:51.750 --> 13:55.750
It didn't matter if I had fifty
or a thousand dollars in my pocket.

13:56.050 --> 13:59.150
Whatever I had, I'd spend it all.

14:32.733 --> 14:39.100
When I was older I saw this movie by Alfred
Hitchcock, Frenzy, about these necktie murders

14:39.700 --> 14:45.150
Oh Barbara, you're about to see a
side of me you've never seen before!

14:45.550 --> 14:54.850
You're such a lucky girl!
Hahaha so very very lucky!!!

15:00.950 --> 15:05.250
What are you doing Harold?
Why are you doing this?

15:05.650 --> 15:12.098
Oh Barbara, you're such a
pretty girl! Now you must die!

15:12.100 --> 15:15.000
Harold! Ahh!

15:30.300 --> 15:34.850
From then on my fantasies
were all about strangling.

15:43.885 --> 15:47.828
In my fantasies there was
always this girl being strangled.

15:49.514 --> 15:51.457
She wasn't fighting or nothing.

15:52.857 --> 15:54.828
She was just letting it happen.

15:55.971 --> 15:59.685
She was letting this guy
choke the life out of her body.

16:03.942 --> 16:07.085
Then she just he the
ground like she was asleep.

16:16.866 --> 16:22.864
Even before I did anything about it, I would
imagine what it would be like if it wasn't a fantasy

16:22.866 --> 16:24.860
What if it was real?

16:36.066 --> 16:44.066
I'd kept pulling it back though, Like the
fantasy was just a tape I could go back to.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
I could have both the fantasy
and real thing, but separate.

16:58.800 --> 17:04.532
My dad got prostate cancer, and I
guess one day he couldn't take the pain.

17:05.200 --> 17:09.200
He swallowed a bottle of
pills and ended up in a coma.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Hey Dad.

17:15.465 --> 17:18.266
I just wanted to drop by.

17:18.400 --> 17:27.066
I don't know if you can here what I'm saying, I'm
just talking because the doctors say you might hear me.

17:27.465 --> 17:30.666
Look, I want to show you something.

17:30.866 --> 17:34.200
These are the grades from my biology class.

17:34.466 --> 17:39.133
Remember you'd pay for a full
semester if I got a B or higher?

17:40.866 --> 17:43.931
Look at that score, huh?

17:43.933 --> 17:45.928
That's 90!

17:45.930 --> 17:49.533
I just zipped through the test
too and I finished with 90!

17:49.733 --> 17:53.933
I'm like the fourth person from
the highest in the whole class!

17:55.866 --> 17:59.000
Yeah well, what does it matter anyway?

17:59.600 --> 18:05.200
One less disappointment, one more disappointment,
guess that's all my life adds up to.

18:05.466 --> 18:08.460
One big disappointment.

18:08.933 --> 18:11.066
Is that why you did it?

18:12.933 --> 18:15.266
You just couldn't take anymore?

18:18.933 --> 18:24.933
You always have to have
the last word, don't you?

18:27.260 --> 18:35.333
I don't know if he was too far gone to hear me
or ignore me as usual. He was always good at that.

18:47.266 --> 18:52.000
So I haven't seen you around? Are you new?

18:53.333 --> 18:56.533
I knew something was
wrong but I couldn't stop

18:59.266 --> 19:03.466
I guess I was just thinking
with the wrong head.

19:08.666 --> 19:11.400
Before I could wise up it was too late.

19:23.933 --> 19:27.933
Somehow I managed to keep my mom
from finding out about the bust.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.400
It wasn't fun but I guess
it could've been worse.

19:34.066 --> 19:37.333
It didn't stop me from
looking for girls, though.

19:38.266 --> 19:41.930
One time I met this girl who said
she had an apartment we could go to.

19:43.666 --> 19:50.530
She took my money, went inside, then said she
had to wait for her grandmother to go asleep.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.400
I ended waiting outside
that door for almost an hour.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.733
I had girls running games
down me all the time.

20:34.660 --> 20:37.800
I guess that's one of the reasons
the first murder went down.

20:45.866 --> 20:52.066
It was just like any other night. My mom was on
vacation for a month and I was alone at the house.

20:52.333 --> 20:57.133
I figured I'd pick up a girl and take them
back for the night, nothing unusual about that.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.333
She was the first to approach me that night

21:01.733 --> 21:10.733
Her name was Star. We worked a deal
and that was that. She was mine.

21:11.400 --> 21:17.198
I have a place that we could
stay at for the night and uh...

21:17.200 --> 21:19.933
...I was thinking like you
could stay the whole night.

21:21.933 --> 21:29.666
That's cool man, if the
money's right up for anything!

21:33.200 --> 21:40.800
Do you think we could, um stop at my friend's
place first, I just gotta pickup something first...

21:40.866 --> 21:44.866
...it 's uh, not very far I promise.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.331
Yeah.

21:48.333 --> 21:53.258
Ok, so you're going to go
straight ahead, and then...

21:53.260 --> 21:53.264
Ok, so you're going to go straight ahead, and then... First thing
you learn about these girls is that it's all about that narcotic fix.

21:53.266 --> 21:58.600
First thing you learn about these girls
is that it's all about that narcotic fix.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.133
That's their main drive.

22:03.866 --> 22:09.533
With this girl Star, she was a shooter.

22:19.466 --> 22:22.933
I didn't even think about bringing
her back to my mom's house.

22:23.133 --> 22:28.200
The neighbors were already used to me coming home at all
hours of the night and working on my cars in the front yard.

22:28.733 --> 22:32.933
It was no big deal to take people there,
especially when my mom wasn't around.

24:00.666 --> 24:04.222
I need to use the restroom, where is it?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.555
It's down the hall on the left.

24:13.333 --> 24:21.000
Of course, this is three or four hours since
she's shot up so she's got to shoot up again.

24:43.333 --> 24:47.555
Whether she knew it or not, she was
doing everything to push my buttons.

24:48.111 --> 24:51.998
Every she was doing to me was
aggravating me, pushing me.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.888
It was pushing me toward
something she had no idea about...

24:56.333 --> 24:59.777
Is there anywhere we can
score? We gotta go now.

25:01.888 --> 25:10.333
Did you here me? We gotta go, get your coat, we gotta
go, do you know a place? There's gotta be a place!

25:11.111 --> 25:14.333
Alright you wanna go? Let's go!

25:20.444 --> 25:25.111
It was a souvenir artillery shell
I'd picked up at the flea market.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.888
Ah!!! Fuck!!!

27:42.000 --> 27:47.777
When I woke up I wasn't sure If I'd
really done it or if it was all a dream.

28:07.111 --> 28:10.555
At that point, I was in disposal mode.

28:12.111 --> 28:16.658
My line of thought was to cut the
body into as many pieces as possible.

28:16.660 --> 28:16.664
My line of thought was to cut the body into as many pieces as possible. And
each piece goes into a different place, and the whole body just disappears.

28:16.666 --> 28:22.444
And each piece goes into a different
place, and the whole body just disappears.

28:24.111 --> 28:26.222
It's just like carving a turkey.

28:26.666 --> 28:32.333
I just cut through the muscles and skin
and cartilage and then popped the bone.

28:38.444 --> 28:41.777
It took me a while, but I
was able to get her head off.

28:48.888 --> 28:56.000
There actually wasn't much blood. Once the heart
stops pumping the blood thicken, coagulates together.

28:59.444 --> 29:04.111
I didn't know this stuff
before, trade secrets I guess.

29:32.888 --> 29:39.777
For some reason I got real worried about dental records,
so I decided to pull her teeth and dump them separately.

30:25.444 --> 30:28.444
In one location I threw out legs.

30:28.888 --> 30:31.888
I went somewhere else
and threw out the head.

30:32.888 --> 30:36.555
And then I threw the arms
and torso into the river.

30:48.222 --> 30:53.998
...Police are looking for any clues in connection
to severed body parts which were found on monday...

30:54.000 --> 31:06.111
...a head belonging to an unknown white female in her mid twenties
was discovered by groundskeepers at the Regal National Golf Course...

31:39.666 --> 31:44.222
I started getting really agitated
after they found that head.

31:47.888 --> 31:55.111
For about a month, I kept checking the cars outside the
house, making sure there weren't any undercover patrols.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.333
I kept going out and picking up girls
but I always did everything in the car.

32:06.888 --> 32:09.333
Never in a hotel room or at home.

32:09.770 --> 32:16.466
That way I could make sure it would never
happen again. What was done was done.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.333
I was finished.

32:20.111 --> 32:25.444
That was just a video I could go back
to and rewatch, but, that's all it was.

32:30.555 --> 32:37.222
I found this girl Jamie strolling under a
bridge. My mom was on another long vacation.

34:18.110 --> 34:20.554
It was just another night.

34:21.333 --> 34:27.666
We were hanging out, watcing TV
together like a friend just staying over.

34:37.880 --> 34:43.666
Things started turn out bad when I tried to
withdraw some extra money for her at the ATM.

34:46.777 --> 34:50.666
I'd made a deposit earlier that week,
and I knew the money was in there.

34:53.666 --> 34:58.777
We decided to come back to my house and come
back to the bank in two hours when it opened.

35:14.222 --> 35:19.444
Hey, it's been two hours already let's go!

35:21.000 --> 35:28.888
I'm almost sure that if that money had come out
of that machine that she'd still be alive today.

35:39.333 --> 35:44.444
After I knocked out number two, I felt like I needed
to practice what it felt like to strangle someone.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.555
Many years after this I would find out that there's
more than one way to kill someone by strangling.

35:51.333 --> 35:56.331
The first away is that you cut off their air
supply, their brain runs out of oxygene and they die.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.328
Then there's a second way...

35:58.330 --> 36:00.330
...much faster...

36:00.666 --> 36:05.000
...you squeeze their carotid artery
and cut off blood flow to the brain.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.777
They fall unconscious
immediately and die much quicker.

36:12.555 --> 36:15.888
When I started with number
two I didn't know any of this.

36:16.550 --> 36:24.438
Strangling is easy in theory but, when you get your hands around
a real person it's difficult to figure out what you need to do.

36:24.440 --> 36:24.442
Strangling is easy in theory but, when you get your hands around a real person it's difficult
to figure out what you need to do. I don't know if what I did was very quick or effective.

36:24.444 --> 36:27.000
I don't know if what I did
was very quick or effective.

36:28.555 --> 36:34.444
What I do know is that by the time I'd finished
strangling, she'd stopped breathing and she never woke up.

36:37.777 --> 36:43.555
My mom wasn't coming home for a few days so I figured I'd
take some time to figure out what my next move would be.

36:45.777 --> 36:48.777
I fell out into a deep
sleep for a few hours.

36:51.444 --> 36:54.222
When I woke up I had my plan.

37:39.666 --> 37:42.331
I dismembered her in the
same way as the first one.

37:42.333 --> 37:44.330
Then I put the parts into plaster.

37:47.111 --> 37:52.222
I couldn't fit the torso into plaster so I stuck
that in a milk crate and that went into the river.

37:53.333 --> 37:56.333
I knew by the time I got to
number three that I was in trouble.

37:57.777 --> 38:02.333
I also knew that if I tried to talk to anybody
about it they'd just throw me in prison.

38:07.888 --> 38:12.888
How do you get treatment for something like this if
anytime you try to speak out they throw you in jail?

38:13.777 --> 38:15.666
You want it to stop, don't you?

38:17.333 --> 38:21.333
Why don't try to help people with their
problems so they don't kill more people?

38:32.222 --> 38:41.111
I'd already been interested in true crime, but after the third one
I thought I should make a study of what other killers were doing.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Maybe I might find some way
to channel what I was doing.

38:45.666 --> 38:47.888
Maybe I could find a way to stop it.

38:55.111 --> 38:58.666
I think I ended following a
lot of what Green River did.

38:59.444 --> 39:03.000
If he did them in bunch,
I would do them in bunches.

39:03.111 --> 39:08.222
He started dumping them in the river so
I dumped them in rivers, things like that.

39:09.666 --> 39:16.222
Some things you read about, you think about what it means
to you and it either makes sense or it doesn't make sense.

39:17.777 --> 39:20.888
A lot of what he was doing
seemed to make sense to me.

39:37.777 --> 39:42.888
Another thing that the kept talking about with
these killers was that they kept souvenirs.

39:43.888 --> 39:50.555
Even before I read that, I'd been keeping things, but reading
about what everyone else did made me want to do it more.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.998
That seemed to make sense, all these girls would
carry around purse filled with all kinds of junk.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.218
Because they never knew where
they were going to flop out next.

40:16.220 --> 40:16.220
Because they never knew where they were going to flop out next. Keep
the stuff was another way of keeping that videotape fresh in my head.

40:16.222 --> 40:20.888
Keep the stuff was another way of
keeping that videotape fresh in my head.

40:39.111 --> 40:44.888
I don't think I saved something from every girl,
but I'd say I kept something from most of them.

41:13.222 --> 41:17.777
A couple of times I thought
about having sex with the bodies.

41:22.666 --> 41:28.666
You read about the guys like Ted Bundy doing stuff like
that and you think it might be something interesting to do.

41:32.777 --> 41:37.888
There was a moment with number two where I
thought I might, but that passed real quick.

41:41.777 --> 41:44.664
That's just too sick to even think about.

41:44.666 --> 41:47.777
I don't even know how someone can do that.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.222
She said her name was Macy.

42:41.666 --> 42:43.222
She seemed a little different.

42:44.888 --> 42:46.444
Nicer.

42:52.222 --> 42:55.111
She was smoking crack all night.

42:55.888 --> 43:00.777
I started to get caught in this scam where I
was driving her to all these places to get high.

43:01.444 --> 43:05.111
All the while I was paying
money for her to get high.

43:28.666 --> 43:33.555
The more this kept going, the
more I felt like a total idiot.

43:34.444 --> 43:39.111
I spent almost two-hundred bucks
on her drugs before we even had sex.

43:39.777 --> 43:45.777
Finally I managed to get her to go
to a hotel but things just get worse.

45:19.222 --> 45:23.109
God, why are you crying?

45:23.111 --> 45:25.110
I hate my life!

45:25.777 --> 45:32.444
I just got out of rehab two weeks
ago and I'm already getting stoned.

45:33.111 --> 45:35.777
My life is fucked!

45:38.555 --> 45:42.111
I just want to fucking die!

45:45.555 --> 45:49.333
I just want to fucking die right now!

45:51.222 --> 45:53.331
Do you really want to die?

45:53.333 --> 45:55.330
Yes!

45:58.555 --> 46:00.666
Fine!

46:59.000 --> 47:02.888
She was one of the weird ones.
She didn't even put up a fight.

47:03.222 --> 47:08.222
She just accepted it. It's
like she was ready to die.

47:21.222 --> 47:25.888
As soon as I finished I started
to feel those nerves again.

47:26.333 --> 47:31.666
My thought was, two people come into
the hotel, two people have to come out.

47:32.666 --> 47:36.111
And the hotel manager's got my
car on closed circuit camera.

47:36.333 --> 47:41.555
He's got my license plate number on the
receipt for the room. I had to be careful.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.222
First, I've got to get
the body out of the room.

48:08.444 --> 48:14.111
I ended up driving around all night and into the
morning while I was thinking of how to get that body out.

48:14.333 --> 48:17.555
I ended up at this garbage
dump behind this building.

48:28.333 --> 48:33.111
I started dreaming of these crazy schemes
where I could get the body into the dumpster.

48:35.666 --> 48:38.000
First I needed to get it out of the room.

48:48.444 --> 48:54.222
I started thinking of that movie Frenzy,
where the guy hides the body in the trunk.

49:14.000 --> 49:22.888
It seemed like a good way to get the body out of the room, and I
could tell the manager I was moving upstate with all my possessions.

50:05.777 --> 50:09.111
I did end up driving upstate.

50:09.222 --> 50:13.000
I found a park and dumped the
body off behind some trees.

50:19.333 --> 50:24.888
The next few weeks were normal again. I had
a bunch of dates but I didn't hurt anyone.

50:25.777 --> 50:28.553
Every time I had sex I
thought about it though.

50:28.555 --> 50:30.550
But that wasn't unusual.

50:30.777 --> 50:35.553
There were always those fantasies about strangling
every girl I ever had even before I started killing them.

50:35.555 --> 50:37.550
It was just my thing.

50:38.333 --> 50:44.444
I guess the impulse got more natural think
about when I started acting on those fantasies.

51:05.266 --> 51:09.768
I was a regular customer of
number five. I really liked her.

51:09.770 --> 51:13.111
I never had a problem with
her before, very sweet girl.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.444
When I started strangling her,
she tried to tell me something.

51:18.544 --> 51:22.110
She couldn't really talk, but
she kind of mouthed the words.

51:22.333 --> 51:26.000
Something about making a big
mistake or something like that.

51:27.666 --> 51:31.333
I couldn't tell whether she was trying
to beg for her life or threaten me.

51:34.111 --> 51:36.111
I guess it doesn't matter.

52:01.066 --> 52:04.658
I still that this trunk from the earlier
murder stashed in a storage unit I owned...

52:04.660 --> 52:04.664
I still that this trunk from the earlier murder stashed in a storage unit I owned... so I went over to the
unit, dumped the new body in the trunk then I decided to dump the body at this lake I found off the highway.

52:04.666 --> 52:11.533
...so I went over to the unit, dumped the new body in the trunk
then I decided to dump the body at this lake I found off the highway.

52:22.800 --> 52:25.731
I don't even know why I did that one.

52:25.733 --> 52:27.730
She was never any trouble.

52:39.933 --> 52:42.133
I'm still puzzled about that one.

53:13.266 --> 53:15.800
I took a few months off after that one.

53:16.333 --> 53:19.800
But a few days before Christmas,
I decided to pick up another date.

53:37.533 --> 53:39.800
Number six I don't remember much about.

53:40.666 --> 53:42.333
I don't remember her name.

55:12.466 --> 55:18.466
With a few of the later ones I'd prop them up in the passenger seat
and drive them around to where I needed to go to get rid of them.

55:20.666 --> 55:25.533
One time I even drop to a gas station and went into
prepay while had one of them sitting in the trunk.

55:28.466 --> 55:29.858
I know it's hard to understand, but...

55:29.860 --> 55:29.864
I know it's hard to understand, but... after each one
of these things I'd get into what I like to call my...

55:29.866 --> 55:32.864
...after each one of these things
I'd get into what I like to call my...

55:32.866 --> 55:34.860
...Logical Phase...

55:35.400 --> 55:37.533
...when I'm focused on disposal.

55:37.933 --> 55:39.530
And making them disappear.

55:46.400 --> 55:49.066
I didn't think of them as dead bodies.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.066
They were just things
that needed to disappear.

56:00.133 --> 56:03.600
After the soul leaves the body
it's just dead weight, right?

56:20.066 --> 56:23.066
I remember number seven
happened the day after Christmas.

56:23.466 --> 56:26.800
I cancelled my Pinochle game so
I could go out to the streets.

56:28.266 --> 56:32.266
I don't remember much. The
tape's a little fuzzy on this one.

57:02.466 --> 57:05.328
After I dumped her off I
started going through her purse.

57:05.330 --> 57:05.331
After I dumped her off I started going through her purse. I
found out she had a prescription for AZT, so she must've had AIDS.

57:05.333 --> 57:09.800
I found out she had a prescription
for AZT, so she must've had AIDS.

57:24.733 --> 57:26.866
I kept it as a souvenir.

57:48.333 --> 57:51.666
When I was younger I used to feel
stressed about getting Herpes or Gonhorea.

57:53.600 --> 57:57.728
I remember one time, when I got all
these large round lesions all over me.

57:57.730 --> 57:57.731
I remember one time, when I got all these large round lesions all over me. I
used to get them in the back of my throat and I couldn't swallow, very painful.

57:57.733 --> 58:01.733
I used to get them in the back of my
throat and I couldn't swallow, very painful.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.600
I'd be laying in bed for days
with a hundred degree temperature.

58:09.533 --> 58:14.000
The doctor would give me Penicillin and Codeine
and I'd be knocked out for two or three days.

58:16.133 --> 58:20.066
Then for about a year I was
misdiagnosed with Hepatitis-C.

58:20.733 --> 58:25.400
I went to one of these free clinics and they
screwed up my blood test and said I was positive.

58:26.066 --> 58:30.458
I think that also fueled my anger at these girls
because for a year I had that hanging over me.

58:30.460 --> 58:30.464
I think that also fueled my anger at these girls because for a year I had that hanging
over me. That thought that I had to live with this disease for the rest of my life.

58:30.466 --> 58:34.933
That thought that I had to live with
this disease for the rest of my life.

58:39.266 --> 58:42.066
I was more upset about Hepatitis than AIDS.

58:42.533 --> 58:47.466
If the girl felt better that I wore a condom then
I'd wear one but it was no big deal to go without one.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.400
Most of the time they didn't give a shit.

58:50.800 --> 58:54.398
These girls didn't care about what disease they
were getting or giving out to their dates...

58:54.400 --> 58:58.331
...just as long as they kept getting
that money and getting the drugs.

58:58.333 --> 59:00.866
The more I think about it,
the more it makes me sick.

59:07.066 --> 59:10.933
One time I had a date with
what I would call a Pro's Pro.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.800
Half the time she was out on the street,
I couldn't even tell if she was working.

59:19.866 --> 59:24.328
The story with her was that she mostly
worked with call agencies or brothels, but...

59:24.330 --> 59:24.331
The story with her was that she mostly worked with call agencies or brothels,
but... she worked the streets when calls dried up and she needed some extra cash.

59:24.333 --> 59:28.866
...she worked the streets when calls
dried up and she needed some extra cash.

01:00:21.533 --> 01:00:23.866
I'm not down with that kinky shit!

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.733
I'm not your girlfriend!
I'm out here doing a job!

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.200
Drop me back off!

01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:54.600
Seat belt.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.400
I had a part time job at a liquor store that I was supposed to
be at, but I blew that to go prowling around looking for a date.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.666
I found this one girl and found a place
out in the projects where we could park.

01:04:16.266 --> 01:04:19.600
When I got home, my mom was
yelling at me about the job.

01:04:20.466 --> 01:04:23.000
She said my boss had
already called three times.

01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:27.866
My boss was pretty pissed because
they had a line backed out the door.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.200
I was already exhausted but I still went back
into work and finished out the rest of my day.

01:05:35.466 --> 01:05:37.600
Hey, what's your name?

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.998
What?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I said what's your name?

01:05:44.133 --> 01:05:47.466
It's Kerrie, you idiot!

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.866
Oh goodness!

01:05:58.066 --> 01:05:59.733
Wait a minute!

01:06:54.133 --> 01:06:56.333
Shit!

01:07:05.533 --> 01:07:09.658
I bent up the shifter while I was struggling
with her and the car wouldn't go into drive.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:09.664
I bent up the shifter while I was struggling with
her and the car wouldn't go into drive. Son of a...

01:07:09.666 --> 01:07:12.933
Son of a...

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:20.258
God damnit... GOD DAMNIT!

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:20.264
God damnit... GOD DAMNIT! FUCK!

01:07:20.266 --> 01:07:21.666
FUCK!

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.660
I eventually got the shift bent back and made
it out of there, but that was a close one.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.400
Number thirteen, another weird one.

01:07:39.133 --> 01:07:40.800
God damnit!

01:08:32.133 --> 01:08:34.666
She was the toughest one to kill.

01:08:35.866 --> 01:08:39.200
She scratched me up pretty
bad before I could get to her.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.265
She was the only one I buried.

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:33.733
Rigor mortis must've sprung her
hand up because I buried her...

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.399
...not deep enough I guess.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.798
...Police are still searching for any evidence
in relation to the discovery two weeks ago...

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.200
...of a body in an East Long Island park.

01:09:51.666 --> 01:09:57.058
Authorities say the unidentified woman's body was
discovered by a group of hikers on a nature walk in the area.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:57.064
Authorities say the unidentified woman's body was discovered by a group of hikers on a nature walk in the area. These hikers
found what appeared to be a woman's hand, which lead investigators to unearth a half-decayed body buried in a shallow grave.

01:09:57.066 --> 01:10:04.800
These hikers found what appeared to be a woman's hand, which lead
investigators to unearth a half-decayed body buried in a shallow grave.

01:10:11.066 --> 01:10:13.800
Immediately I started getting
aroused when I saw her.

01:10:17.866 --> 01:10:23.266
I knew who she was. I'd already seen her
performing a sex show on Eighth Avenue.

01:10:40.933 --> 01:10:43.200
Just hang on a second.

01:10:45.266 --> 01:10:49.400
Goddamnit... just hang on, one minute.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.600
You okay?

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.066
Fuck you!

01:11:24.733 --> 01:11:26.266
Godamnit!

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.066
Then I'm driving on the highway back
home with this bodyin the back seat.

01:12:37.933 --> 01:12:43.133
I'm passing all kinds of places where I could dump
this body off but I'm not going to any of them.

01:12:43.866 --> 01:12:48.133
With most of these girls I'm disposing
of them within an hour of picking them up.

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:54.466
I'm with this one, I'm flying down the main
highway with all these high trucks and buses.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.200
None of this makes sense.

01:13:04.266 --> 01:13:06.666
It's a total lack of logic.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:31.133
Instead of getting rid of the body I decided to stash it
in the garage because I had some work to do on the truck.

01:13:56.533 --> 01:14:01.266
I'd got so into working on the truck over the
weekend that I left the body in the garage.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.533
I just didn't have the
energy to deal with it.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.400
I just kept focusing on the truck.

01:14:08.466 --> 01:14:14.933
Also, by this point I'd already been up about three days
without any sleep so things are starting to get cloudy.

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:35.200
By the time I got a plan together to
dump the body it was already rotten.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:44.133
Thankfully I remembered that trick from the movie Silence of the
Lambs, where that guy puts Noxema under his nose to help with the smell.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.800
That seemed to work really well.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:45.866
Right now I'm in logical mode... just
dealing with the smell... moving forward...

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.733
...thinking about these woods near the
airport where I can drop off this package.

01:15:51.733 --> 01:15:53.800
Disposal mode.

01:15:58.933 --> 01:16:08.666
Maintaining control... looking out for obstacles, road blocks...
I'm doing the speed limit... nothing to see here, move along...

01:17:06.533 --> 01:17:11.266
I heard something fall off the back of the truck
and I was sure it was a wrench or something.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.400
I was working on these truck all weekend
and I had my tools all over the place.

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:20.133
Later on I realized it was
my license plate falling off.

01:17:52.933 --> 01:17:56.933
I don't even have my driver's
license and registration with me.

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:04.333
On top of that, the minute they pull this
truck over they're going to smell that body.

01:18:06.733 --> 01:18:09.133
I don't have any choice but to run.

01:18:44.466 --> 01:18:46.200
I'm trying to keep logical.

01:18:47.933 --> 01:18:49.733
Keep the vehicle on the road.

01:18:51.466 --> 01:18:57.200
Get to the water, dump the truck in the water and then climb out and
hide under the pier in the water for a few hours while they look for me.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:00.600
Keep them guessing,
keep them looking for...

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.466
I don't blame anyone else.

01:19:14.866 --> 01:19:16.933
Ultimately I did it to myself.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:23.000
If it wasn't number seventeen I would've eventually screwed
something up with the next one or the one after and got caught.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.000
I had a plan to quit.

01:19:25.066 --> 01:19:29.600
Just before I got caught, I was about to see
a realtor about some land in West Virginia.

01:19:30.133 --> 01:19:34.600
I figured I'd go down there, do
my Unabomber thing, keep to myself.

01:19:36.933 --> 01:19:39.133
I guess it never would've worked out.

01:19:39.866 --> 01:19:45.133
Sometimes I wake up spooked about something
but, otherwise this place isn't so bad.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.800
The day has a rhythm. You just go with it.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.666
The worst thing on the mainline is
that I get hassled to sign something.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.000
People think anything with a serial
killer's name on it is worth money.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.266
After a few year of taking antidepressents
in prison my mind began to change.

01:20:02.666 --> 01:20:07.664
It was kind of like a window into my own thoughts
began to clear up, where before it was all hazy.

01:20:07.666 --> 01:20:09.658
I think about what I did.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:11.658
Sometimes I think about the girls.

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:13.933
I think about where
they'd be if they'd lived.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.733
Would they still be hitting the
pipe? Would they be straightened out?

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.333
For some reason that matters to me.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.200
I guess neither of us really had a choice.

01:20:26.466 --> 01:20:29.600
For me it was easy. I liked killing them.

01:20:30.933 --> 01:20:34.133
And for them it was their job
to get into stranger's cars.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:40.466
I guess it just finally
just caught up to both of us.

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:42.210
