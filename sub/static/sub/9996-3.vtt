00:01.100 --> 00:03.700
Looks pretty tempting,
doesn't it?

00:03.700 --> 00:05.700
But what if I told you
that each one of these

00:05.700 --> 00:10.200
delicious little morsels
has almost a thousand calories?

00:10.200 --> 00:12.800
Would it make you
want one any less?

00:12.800 --> 00:16.100
Me, neither.
And that's normal.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.900
We all want things
that we know are bad for us.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.600
Everyone has dangerous fascinations
and unhealthy fixations.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.300
Some of them are a little
harder to explain than others.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.900
But most us know how
to keep our impulses in check.

00:41.900 --> 00:45.800
We use willpower to fight off
our darker instincts.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.400
Unfortunately, for others,

00:50.400 --> 00:53.400
willpower just isn't enough.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.400
The siren call
of one's own obsessions

00:57.400 --> 01:01.200
is simply too strong to resist.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
The thing we used to want...

01:15.400 --> 01:18.300
...becomes the thing
we now need.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.900
Our obsession becomes
our compulsion.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.700
Until eventually we realize

01:26.700 --> 01:30.600
pursuing the one thing
we want most in life

01:31.600 --> 01:35.500
has left us without much
of a life at all.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.300
But in the end,

01:38.300 --> 01:41.700
our compulsions
are still there.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.800
Even after they've pushed us
to the brink of death,

01:46.500 --> 01:48.400
or guided us

01:48.400 --> 01:52.500
into places
of unimaginable horror.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.400
Okay. Don't be mad.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.000
I know, I know they're for that
bake sale at Bridgette's school,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.600
but what can I say?
I couldn't resist.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.400
- You want some?
- God, no.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.400
I'm going to bed.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.700
What?

02:12.700 --> 02:15.000
It was a cupcake.

medium s05e03

03:03.600 --> 03:06.400
Okay. Now you try.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.100
What are you doing?

03:08.100 --> 03:10.700
What's she doing?
????

03:10.700 --> 03:13.400
I'm not making her do anything.
She likes it.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.800
Don't you like it?

03:15.800 --> 03:18.700
Don't just stand there.
You know, fold some more.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.400
Bridgette, that's your job.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.000
You're supposed to fold the laundry.
That's why you have an allowance.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
It's not my job.
It's my responsibility.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.300
And I'm keeping that responsibility.
I'm just outsourcing, that's all.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.700
It's no big deal.
Everybody's doing it.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.000
Mom!

03:34.000 --> 03:35.800
Sorry. Not Mom.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.500
Feel free to continue fighting
till she gets here.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.500
Dad, Bridgette's making Marie
do her work folding the laundry.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.800
Nuh-uh. She asked me how
to fold socks. That's all.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.500
And underwear. And towels,
and how to put them in drawers.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.300
You are such a liar.

03:50.300 --> 03:53.900
Okay, well, maybe she didn't ask
about the drawers.

03:53.900 --> 03:58.100
Hey, Marie, did you ask
Bridgette any of that?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.600
You are never moving
out of that bottom bunk!

04:00.600 --> 04:03.800
Hey, what is all the noise about?
Why isn't anybody eating?

04:03.800 --> 04:06.300
Why-Why is all this laundry
still not folded?

04:06.300 --> 04:10.400
And Bridgette, why are
your books not in your bag?

04:11.500 --> 04:14.300
- What is this?
- I don't know.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.700
It's a week old,
and it's marked urgent.

04:16.700 --> 04:19.899
Well, then I guess
it wasn't really very urgent, was it?

04:19.899 --> 04:23.000
Tomorrow's Parent-Teacher
conference has been rescheduled.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.600
You're kidding!  I rearranged
a meeting so I could make that.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.600
And I already told Mr. Sacks that
I can't make rehearsal 'cause I have to baby-sit.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.000
Bridgette!

04:32.000 --> 04:35.800
It's not even 7:00, and I'm already
having a bad feeling about today.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.700
You know, I don't care.
Dad's got to go to work.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.900
I just got a text.
I got to meet Scanlon downtown.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.700
We're gonna talk
about punishment later.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.000
We've got to get breakfast going.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.400
Nice work, doofus.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.700
Well, I suppose there's
a bright side to all this.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.300
We all have a free night.

04:51.300 --> 04:53.800
Every single one of us
all here at the same time.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.800
No meetings, no rehearsal.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.400
You're right, Dad!
That's great news!

04:58.400 --> 05:01.000
It's not that great.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.700
Security guard stumbled
across the body.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.200
We're thinking it
happened last night.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.700
Looks like they used a
baseball bat or a pipe.

05:12.900 --> 05:16.500
Normally, I'd start by asking his family
and friends if he had any enemies.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.300
Of course, to do that, I'd have to
have the first clue who this guy is.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.100
No wallet?

05:21.100 --> 05:23.300
Actually, it was right
there in his pocket.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.700
Only problem is, every piece
of ID he's carrying is fake.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.700
Check out his fingers.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.100
No fingerprints.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.600
Who do you think did this?

05:35.600 --> 05:37.400
I'm guessing since
he's carrying all that fake ID,

05:37.400 --> 05:41.500
that his very severe mani
is just part of the package.

05:41.500 --> 05:45.300
This is a guy who clearly didn't want
anyone to know who he really was,

05:45.300 --> 05:48.700
- which is why I called you.
- Coming through, Detective.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.900
I was hoping maybe you'd see him,

05:52.900 --> 05:55.400
and, you know, get some feeling,
have some instinct...

05:55.400 --> 05:59.300
...about who-who he guy is,
where he came from.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.700
Who might have done this.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.400
Allison, you with me?

06:19.500 --> 06:21.100
Yeah. Of course.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.500
If I see anything,
I'll call you.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.900
Hey, Lee, you see... you see
this old microwave over here?

06:28.900 --> 06:30.900
You think it's okay
if I just, you know,

06:30.900 --> 06:33.100
dig it out of the trash,
take it home with me?

06:33.100 --> 06:35.100
Tell you what. You help me
figure out who, uh,

06:35.100 --> 06:38.600
played percussion on this guy's noggin,
I'll even buy you a new one.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.300
Mr.Brewer?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.200
What you doing?

06:51.200 --> 06:53.500
You gunning for my job?

06:53.700 --> 06:56.900
You trying to be an early bird
or something?

06:56.900 --> 06:58.400
Hmm.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.900
I don't like it.
Ambition.

07:01.900 --> 07:05.100
Initiative.
Makes me nervous.

07:05.100 --> 07:08.500
I-I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.000
I couldn't sleep.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.600
I kept thinking about
the problem with the contact grid.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.600
I know we've been
going around and around
this for the past three weeks,

07:16.600 --> 07:19.600
but, uh, you know,
suddenly at 3:00 this morning,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.500
I had a, uh...

07:25.300 --> 07:26.900
This just came to you?

07:26.900 --> 07:28.000
Well, the concept.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.900
I got in here about
an hour and a half ago,

07:29.900 --> 07:33.100
and I started
working on the engineering.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.400
Well...

07:35.400 --> 07:38.200
This-This is amazing.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.600
Okay.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.000
Now I'm officially threatened
by your intellect.

07:45.100 --> 07:48.500
Hey, what are you and Debbie
doing for dinner tomorrow night?

07:48.500 --> 07:51.400
I mean, are you busy?
Do you have plans? Are you...?

07:51.400 --> 07:52.800
I've been talking to my wife
about having you guys over

07:52.800 --> 07:55.900
since you got here, like,
a month and a half ago.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.200
Hello!

08:02.200 --> 08:05.100
Gooey red stuff.
What did I miss? Spaghetti?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.900
Ketchup for,
uh, take-out.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.900
Okay. Where is everybody?

08:09.900 --> 08:11.700
Where? It's, uh, late, Dad.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.300
I put Bridgette and Marie down, and, uh,
Mom went out to work in the garage.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.800
Work in the garage?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.700
Al?

08:21.700 --> 08:23.400
Back here!

08:23.400 --> 08:24.500
Hi.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.900
Ariel said you were in here.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.600
What's going on?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.500
What are you doing?
What are you working on?

08:31.200 --> 08:34.000
I don't know. You're gonna..
you're gonna think it's silly.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.200
Looks like you're trying
to take apart an old microwave.

08:36.200 --> 08:40.299
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm taking apart an old microwave.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.799
You know, I found this thing in the trash
at the crime scene this morning,

08:42.799 --> 08:46.500
and I suddenly got really curious
about the way these things work.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.600
What do you mean?
Just ask me.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.200
They use, uh, radio waves
to create a kind of radiation.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
That creates excitement in
the molecules in the food,

08:52.200 --> 08:53.900
and that causes them to heat up,
and that makes it cook.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.500
You know we have one
of these in the kitchen.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.200
Well, not an old one like this.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.500
You know, I just want to look inside,
see how it does it.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.300
How you put food inside,
it comes out hot,

09:03.300 --> 09:07.500
but then the oven stays cool.
Did you eat?

09:07.500 --> 09:10.000
David and I ordered in.
That reminds me.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.600
Hey, don't be mad.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.300
I invited he and his wife Debbie
over tomorrow night for dinner.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.300
It's time, Allison.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.400
The guy relocated here with his family
almost two months ago.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.300
Yeah, fine. I'll make a roast.
Do they eat meat?

09:21.300 --> 09:23.800
Yeah, he sure does.
I mean, boy, can he engineer.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.300
I mean, what a find.

09:25.300 --> 09:29.400
Um, couldn't you find
a less gross-looking microwave?

09:29.400 --> 09:32.200
I mean, it looks like you can
catch a disease from that thing.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.900
I'll be in in a minute.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.600
All right, fine.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.300
I've been kicked out of bed
nicer than that.

09:38.300 --> 09:42.200
- I'll see you in a couple of minutes.
- See you in a couple of minutes.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.800
Do you know that it's
almost 3:00 in the morning?

10:10.800 --> 10:12.200
Hey, hey.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.600
Do you have any idea how much
heat this thing can generate?

10:14.600 --> 10:16.200
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.800
I would say roughly enough to bake
a big potato in about seven minutes.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
Can we go to bed?

10:22.600 --> 10:26.400
Allison, you've been out here
for almost six hours now.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.500
I don't know what this fascination is
with small appliances,

10:30.500 --> 10:32.800
but you've got a big day tomorrow.
We both have big days.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.800
We have people
coming over for dinner.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.600
Oh, my God.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.900
What time did you say it was?

10:38.900 --> 10:41.500
3:00, it's 3:00
in the morning.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.300
I don't even...

10:43.300 --> 10:45.900
I don't even know what to say.

10:45.900 --> 10:49.900
I-I just suddenly got
so fascinated with that thing, I-I...

10:49.900 --> 10:53.300
I kind of...
I kind of got lost in it.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.000
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

10:58.100 --> 11:02.300
But only a single step is the
beginning of a new dialogue...

11:02.300 --> 11:04.200
between the United States...

11:19.100 --> 11:22.000
The search continues
for Justice Heath Clemens,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.800
a federal judge
on the 12th Circuit Court,

11:23.800 --> 11:26.700
who was reported missing
yesterday afternoon.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.800
Anyone with information
on his whereabouts

11:28.800 --> 11:31.400
is urged to contact
the authorities immediately.
- Arlo!

11:31.400 --> 11:32.500
You in there?!

11:34.900 --> 11:39.100
Arlo, quit tinkering with that
idiot box and come outside.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.700
I got something
I want to show you.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.800
Dad, I just saw this man
on the news.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.700
They're looking for him.

11:49.700 --> 11:53.800
- His name's, um...
- He doesn't have a name!  No

11:54.000 --> 11:58.100
he surrendered his right
to an identity

11:58.100 --> 12:01.000
on the day he was sworn
onto that court.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.700
The day he agreed to become
another cog in the machine

12:04.700 --> 12:07.500
that is systematically destroying
everything and anything

12:07.500 --> 12:10.400
that was ever good about this country!

12:10.400 --> 12:12.900
He's an extension of them.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.700
A diseased limb.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.900
You're a smart boy, Arlo.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.600
You know what a doctor would do
with a diseased limb, don't you?

12:22.600 --> 12:23.600
Dad, please don't...

12:23.600 --> 12:28.100
You want to know what this...
robot does with his life?

12:28.100 --> 12:31.300
Yeah, he sits behind a bench all day

12:31.300 --> 12:33.000
issuing rulings

12:33.000 --> 12:37.200
that take away the rights o-of
free citizens like you and me.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.100
Yeah, he gets paid to harass us,

12:40.100 --> 12:42.600
to decide how we get
to live our lives.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.500
Now, tell me, does that sound like
th-the kind of government you want?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.800
Is that the way
you want your country run?

12:48.800 --> 12:51.900
Dad, he's not the government.
He's just a man.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.800
He's just a man
trying to do his job.

12:55.700 --> 12:58.600
I'm sorry. Wh-what was
that last bit you said?

12:58.600 --> 13:02.300
'Cause I think you were describing me.

13:10.800 --> 13:14.300
Um, how are we
supposed to eat this?

13:14.300 --> 13:17.300
- With a fork.
- It's not what I mean.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.300
You forgot the syrup.

13:19.300 --> 13:22.900
It's all hard without the syrup.

13:26.100 --> 13:28.600
Ketchup?

13:30.400 --> 13:33.900
All right, knock yourself out
and help your sister, too.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.500
More, more!

13:37.500 --> 13:39.400
All right, all right,
I'm giving you more.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.600
Unh-unh-unh-unh.

13:42.900 --> 13:46.100
- How are we doing over there?
- Never better.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.500
No urge to take apart
the central air?

13:49.500 --> 13:51.800
Figure out how it is
the air comes in so hot,

13:51.800 --> 13:53.400
but comes out so cold?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.300
Is something going on?

13:55.300 --> 13:57.000
Everything's fine.
I just...

13:57.000 --> 13:58.600
Mommy didn't get
a lot of sleep last night,

13:58.600 --> 14:01.000
and Daddy didn't get much either.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.600
But everything's fine.

14:02.600 --> 14:06.000
We still okay for tonight?
It's not too late to call it off.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.300
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.500
I got to go down to City Hall,
show Scanlon something.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.500
Then I'm heading right
to the store to go shopping.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.100
Hey, girls,

14:17.100 --> 14:18.700
when Ariel comes in,
can you be sure to tell her

14:18.700 --> 14:20.600
that she's got to clean her room?

14:20.600 --> 14:23.200
We have company coming tonight.

14:23.200 --> 14:27.100
I will be in the bathroom
taking apart the shower.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.000
I'm just kidding.
Just kidding.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.400
His name was Heath Clemens.
He was a federal judge.

14:33.600 --> 14:37.000
The police think someone abducted him
from his house in Needles, California.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.700
June of '85. So, what does
any of this have to do with me?

14:39.700 --> 14:41.000
Well, did you see the part
where it said

14:41.000 --> 14:43.300
they discovered his body
a few weeks later in the desert,

14:43.300 --> 14:45.300
and no one was ever arrested
for the murder?

14:45.300 --> 14:46.500
Yeah, I can read, Allison.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.600
Well, the man who killed him,
the man I saw slit his throat

14:49.600 --> 14:51.500
was the same man we
discovered the other day,

14:51.500 --> 14:54.700
laying in all that trash--
the one with no fingerprints.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.100
And when you say "saw,"
what you really mean was...?

14:57.100 --> 14:59.900
Dreamt.
What I really meant was dreamt.

14:59.900 --> 15:03.400
Don't... don't start on me today.
I had three hours of sleep last night.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.000
Okay, easy.

15:05.900 --> 15:09.200
So what have we got?
We got a dead guy... no name.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.100
Now, we got another dead guy
from a long time ago

15:11.100 --> 15:12.900
who you say he killed.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.600
I guess that might explain

15:14.600 --> 15:17.500
why he burned
his own fingertips off.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
Needles, California, I guess
we could make a few calls

15:19.500 --> 15:21.200
send them a picture
of our friend in the morgue.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.600
See if anybody recalls him.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.300
Well, he sounded like one of those,

15:24.300 --> 15:26.400
those rightwing conspiracy nuts

15:26.400 --> 15:27.700
who thinks the government
is out to get them,

15:27.700 --> 15:29.900
take away all their personal freedom.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.900
And he had a son.

15:31.900 --> 15:35.100
Well, he sounds like a pretty,
uh, unique character.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.700
Maybe someone will remember him.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.600
I'm home!

16:32.400 --> 16:33.600
Hey...

16:34.700 --> 16:36.900
What in God's...?

16:36.900 --> 16:39.600
Did the dishwasher break?
What's going on?

16:39.600 --> 16:42.300
Nope, it didn't break.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.100
Mom insisted she needed
some sheet metal screws

16:45.100 --> 16:48.300
and the ones in the back of
the dishwasher were perfect.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.800
Needed?
Needed for what?

16:51.300 --> 16:53.500
Where is Mom?

16:54.400 --> 16:57.300
Where is dinner?
People are coming over.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.400
They're going to be here
any minute.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.800
Yeah, I know.
I kept telling her.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.400
What did she say?

17:03.400 --> 17:05.200
She didn't say anything.

17:05.200 --> 17:08.900
She just announced that
she'd be in the garage, working.

17:09.800 --> 17:13.599
- Allison?!
- I'm back here!

17:14.800 --> 17:16.400
What the hell is going on?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.099
I'm soldering.

17:18.099 --> 17:20.300
And I'm getting
pretty good at it, too.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.200
No, that's not what I mean, Allison.
People are on their way over.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.200
There's nothing cooking in the oven.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.599
The dishwasher is sitting in
the middle of the kitchen floor.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.400
You're not dressed.
The kids aren't dressed.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.100
Come on, what the
hell are you doing?!

17:31.100 --> 17:33.500
You know, I-I-I'm not quite sure,

17:33.500 --> 17:36.400
but I was kind of hoping
that you could tell me.

17:36.400 --> 17:40.000
I think this thing really is
going to work, whatever it is.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.800
You set the timer here and then
whenever that time runs out

17:42.800 --> 17:46.100
this thing starts to get hot,
really, really hot,

17:46.100 --> 17:48.800
but why and what that does,
I-I'm not...

17:48.800 --> 17:50.700
What is that smell?

17:50.700 --> 17:52.900
What are you talking about?
What smell?

17:52.900 --> 17:56.900
It almost smells
like a plumbing problem.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.000
Allison?

18:03.900 --> 18:05.800
Did you buy all this fertilizer?

18:05.800 --> 18:10.700
I sure did. It took me
five trips to get it here.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.500
Can you tell me why?

18:12.500 --> 18:13.500
You know, I'm not quite sure.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.300
I mean, I know it's got
something to do with this thing.

18:15.300 --> 18:16.900
It wasn't something I planned to do.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.700
I just... it came into my head,
and I knew I had to have it.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.600
Allison, I need you to step away
from that thing right now.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.400
All right, give me one second, honey.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.500
No, no, time's up.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.900
I need you to step away from
that thing and come with me.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.300
You know, if this is about
this whole dinner thing,

18:41.300 --> 18:45.200
I'm starting to think
maybe we should reschedule.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.600
- What are you doing?
- Put that down.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.700
Get the hell away from that thing.
Get away from it and go in the house.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.300
What the hell is your problem?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.200
My problem? You want
to know what my problem is?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.900
Allison, this thing that
you've been working on all day,

18:56.900 --> 19:00.300
this is some kind of a-a timer.
It's some kind of a detonator.

19:00.300 --> 19:03.300
And these bags... The hundreds of pounds of
fertilizer that you brought into our house,

19:03.300 --> 19:06.300
our house where we live,
where our children live.

19:06.300 --> 19:09.000
These would be your explosives.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.400
Now, I may be crazy,
but I think you're minutes away

19:11.400 --> 19:14.300
from having an uncontrollable urge
to rent a panel truck

19:14.300 --> 19:18.000
and fill it with all this stuff
and drive it to a federal building somewhere!

19:22.400 --> 19:25.100
Oh, God.
Okay, you know what.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.800
On second thought, why don't you
j-just continue doing

19:27.800 --> 19:29.400
exactly what you're doing, okay?

19:29.400 --> 19:34.500
Because, you know, if we're all dead
????

19:37.500 --> 19:40.100
Hi. Sorry.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.100
- David, hi. Debbie.
-  Hello, Joe.

19:43.100 --> 19:47.400
Um, oh, God. This is
so embarrassing. Um...

19:47.800 --> 19:49.500
Are you okay?
Is everything okay?

19:49.500 --> 19:52.300
Yes. No, no.
It's, um...

19:52.300 --> 19:55.300
We've had a, um...
We've had a...

19:55.300 --> 19:57.600
I'm so sorry.
It's my fault.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.100
Um, well, maybe "fault"
isn't the right word.

20:00.100 --> 20:05.200
Um... Uh, it's me.
It... I have food poisoning.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.900
That's Debbie,
and, Allison, that's David.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.500
Yeah, I'm Allison.
It's nice to meet you. I...

20:09.500 --> 20:12.900
It's nice that
I'm... we just met.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.400
Oh, no, no, please.
You don't have to do that.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.500
I-I I've been living in
the bathroom for the last...

20:17.500 --> 20:20.500
the last 45 minutes.
Which is, uh, you know, why...

20:20.500 --> 20:22.000
that's why I'm not dressed.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.700
And, you know, I've been
in there cooking all day.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.300
Uh, we would ask you in, but, uh...

20:28.300 --> 20:32.200
Yeah, it's like
a bomb went off in there.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.300
Or we would ask you to go
to a restaurant,or something...

20:36.300 --> 20:38.700
Oh. I feel terrible for you.

20:38.700 --> 20:42.000
Hey, I've been looking
all over for you guys.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.900
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, uh... This is Bridgette.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.200
This is our middle daughter Bridgette.
Say hi to the Brewers.

20:46.200 --> 20:51.300
Uh, hi. Do you guys know that it smells
like a barn out in the garage?

20:51.300 --> 20:52.600
Hey, we're going to take off.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.800
- Yeah.
- Um, but we brought this.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.700
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to do that.

20:56.700 --> 21:00.000
I... I insist.

21:09.700 --> 21:13.800
I just...
maybe wouldn't drink it tonight.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.700
Right.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.000
All right, Dave.
So long. I'm sorry.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.700
It's nice to meet you, Debbie.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.400
Okay, Bridgette, would you...
would you go and get ready for bed?

21:26.400 --> 21:28.800
Daddy needs to talk to Mommy.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.300
What are you doing?

21:34.800 --> 21:37.700
I called the store.
They're open till 10:00.

21:37.700 --> 21:40.100
So I'm loading up both cars.
We're taking all this back,

21:40.100 --> 21:41.800
'cause I don't want it
in the house, Allison.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.100
I don't want it
anywhere near the house.

21:45.400 --> 21:49.400
Ariel can watch the girls.
You follow me in your car.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.900
We'll get it done
in a couple trips.

21:51.900 --> 21:53.700
I can do this tomorrow.

21:53.700 --> 21:56.600
Yeah... right.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.000
Well, what does that mean?

21:58.000 --> 22:03.700
That means that you built a bomb...
in our house, Allison.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.700
In my children's house.

22:12.900 --> 22:16.000
Now get in the car, please.
It's getting late.

22:24.300 --> 22:28.800
- Are you still awake?
- You're kidding, right?

22:28.800 --> 22:31.000
I think it's over.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.200
I took apart that thing
that I was building.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.000
I threw all the pieces away.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.600
Not even a twinge of regret.

22:38.600 --> 22:44.000
And for what it's worth,
when we went back to that store,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.600
nothing, nothing glowed.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.900
I'm sorry,
but that's not reassuring enough.

22:52.900 --> 22:55.000
I need you to promise me,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.200
if these urges
if these compulsions to...

22:58.200 --> 23:00.600
to build things to acquire things,

23:00.600 --> 23:03.700
if they come back,
you have to call me...

23:03.700 --> 23:05.900
you have to find me.

23:05.900 --> 23:09.000
I'll come home.
I'll hold you down.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.600
I might call you
just to test that.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.300
I'm so sorry.

23:17.300 --> 23:21.200
I'm so sorry about tonight.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.600
ok

23:32.100 --> 23:35.300
So you got all this from
the Needles Police Department?

23:35.300 --> 23:39.200
The sheriff recognized the photo of
our John Doe as soon as he saw it.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.900
Turns out this guy is
actually Mitchell Slocumb.

23:41.900 --> 23:44.400
Mitchell Slocumb...
I know that name.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.400
Well, I would hope so.
He certainly made enough news.

23:47.400 --> 23:51.300
Back in 1985, he detonated
a fertilizer bomb in a parking garage

23:51.300 --> 23:53.800
beneath the federal courthouse
in Sacramento, California.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.800
It was one of the first cases
of domestic terrorism in this country.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.000
Seventeen people died.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.200
Mitchell Slocumb wrote a letter
claiming credit for the bombing.

24:02.200 --> 24:06.900
Then he just disappeared.
That is, until now.

24:07.300 --> 24:10.200
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, yeah.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.200
I'm just...
I'm surprised.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.800
Anyway, this man's death
is gonna be big news,

24:15.800 --> 24:17.100
so before I talk to the media,

24:17.100 --> 24:19.900
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't have any new insights

24:19.900 --> 24:21.500
into who might have killed him.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.900
Although, to be perfectly frank,

24:22.900 --> 24:25.100
I'm not sure if I prefer
to prosecute his murderer

24:25.100 --> 24:28.200
or recommend the guy
for a commendation.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.400
So nothing?

24:36.700 --> 24:38.100
You feeling better today?

24:38.100 --> 24:42.300
Yeah, thank you.
Can I have a word with you?

24:45.000 --> 24:48.800
I started building that bomb two days ago,
just hours after I saw his body.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.800
I have to believe that's more
than just a coincidence.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.800
So you think maybe
that he was using you

24:55.800 --> 24:58.700
to take care
of some unfinished business?

24:58.700 --> 25:01.600
He blew up a federal courthouse in 1985.
I work in a courthouse.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.400
I drive my car into a courthouse
garage every day.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.900
Hmm. Okay.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.200
Um, but you haven't called me,

25:09.200 --> 25:12.700
so I'm assuming that you haven't
felt the need to buy anything,

25:12.700 --> 25:15.400
build anything,
collect anything.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.700
What are you doing?

25:16.700 --> 25:18.400
Well, if we can't be
absolutely positive

25:18.400 --> 25:21.600
that Mitchell Slocumb won't get
into your head again,

25:21.600 --> 25:23.600
at least we can make sure
that you don't have the means

25:23.600 --> 25:26.900
to buy any more fertilizer for him.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.700
A gallon of gas?

25:33.600 --> 25:37.000
Hey. You all right?

25:37.700 --> 25:41.600
Yeah. No... I'm fine.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.100
It's a bad habit.

25:44.300 --> 25:46.400
Debbie thinks I quit.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.700
If she knew,
she'd kill me.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.500
You sure you're okay?

25:57.500 --> 25:59.000
No, I'm okay.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.700
It's family stuff.

26:03.100 --> 26:05.500
It's just...
It's family stuff.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.200
Explain.

26:28.900 --> 26:31.700
Don't lie to me.
Don't lie to me!

26:31.700 --> 26:32.700
Don't tell me it wasn't you.

26:32.700 --> 26:36.100
You'll just make it twice as bad
if you lie to me.

26:39.600 --> 26:45.600
- I just thought he deserved a decent burial...
- I gave him what he deserved, Arlo.

26:46.700 --> 26:51.400
I tried so hard to raise you right.
Look at me!

26:51.800 --> 26:55.300
All you do is disappoint.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.900
The problem with you, son,

26:59.900 --> 27:03.000
is you keep forgetting
we're at war here.

27:03.300 --> 27:05.900
Me-- I got this to remind me.

27:05.900 --> 27:09.600
I see it in the mirror
every day and I remember.

27:09.600 --> 27:14.500
Crawling through the mud
and the puke at Khe Sanh.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.400
I remember my boots

27:17.400 --> 27:20.100
filling with the blood
of young American boys,

27:20.100 --> 27:21.600
whose daddies
either weren't rich enough

27:21.600 --> 27:25.900
or white enough to keep them out
of a racist, classist draft.

27:26.900 --> 27:31.500
I remember the stink
of their corpses...

27:31.800 --> 27:36.700
knowing that they died
for nothing.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.300
Dad, what are you doing?

27:45.300 --> 27:49.400
Like I said, Arlo, we're at war.

27:50.700 --> 27:54.100
Now you'll have something
to remind you.

27:54.300 --> 27:58.100
Dad... Dad!

28:08.500 --> 28:10.800
It was nice seeing you again, Allison.

28:10.800 --> 28:15.700
I hope the next time you meet Debbie,
you'll keep my secret.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.500
Somebody's been awfully
quiet all night.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.300
Well, somebody's in a real quandary.

28:33.300 --> 28:36.000
Oh, really?
You think so?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.300
Have you not heard anything
that I've said?

28:38.300 --> 28:41.100
Yeah, I got it.
He's a smoker.

28:41.100 --> 28:43.500
Me? I'm willing to look past it.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.400
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.600
Seriously?

28:47.600 --> 28:50.000
Because I don't think
the other matters.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.700
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

28:51.700 --> 28:55.700
Let's say that you're right.
Let's say that Mitchell Slocumb
really is David's father.

28:55.700 --> 28:57.400
So what?

28:57.400 --> 28:59.400
Does that change who he is?

28:59.400 --> 29:02.500
Am I supposed to think less of him
because of something that his father did?

29:02.500 --> 29:05.300
Changing your name so people
won't hold what your father did

29:05.300 --> 29:07.300
against you, is that a crime?

29:07.300 --> 29:08.900
Boy, you really don't get it.

29:08.900 --> 29:10.600
No, Allison,
I think I do.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.100
As psychic dilemmas go,
this one's pretty cut-and-dry.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.700
If David Brewer doesn't want
anyone to know who he is,

29:15.700 --> 29:17.800
then that's fine;
that's his business.

29:17.800 --> 29:21.200
I get it. We don't have to ask;
he doesn't have to tell.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.500
But, Joe, I think I have to ask.

29:24.500 --> 29:29.500
I know that Slocumb was a monster,
but it's my job to find out who killed him.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.400
Well, you think
it might have been David?

29:31.400 --> 29:34.300
Well, I don't know.
But if what I'm seeing is true,

29:34.300 --> 29:36.400
in addition to killing
all of these people,

29:36.400 --> 29:39.600
Mitchell Slocumb was
an incredibly abusive parent.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.700
That doesn't make David a killer.

29:41.700 --> 29:45.500
And, look, let's not forget,we're not
absolutely certain that they're father and son.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.200
You should have seen him
outside of your office.

29:47.200 --> 29:51.100
It was right after the news hit
that we identified Slocumb.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.800
David was trembling.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.200
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said it was a family thing.

29:55.200 --> 29:58.300
Well, maybe it was. How do you know?
Maybe he had a fight with his wife.

29:58.300 --> 30:01.800
I am sorry.
I know that you really like him.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.900
But I need to tell Devalos
what I know.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.300
And he's going to want to bring
him in for questioning.

30:07.300 --> 30:10.300
Allison, we're not talking about somebody
that I... that I like here.

30:10.300 --> 30:13.400
We're talking about the only
person that I've hired so far.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.400
He's like half the company.

30:15.400 --> 30:19.700
- It took me three months to find him.
- I know.

30:24.700 --> 30:27.300
let me talk to him first.
I want to be the one to talk to him first.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.900
If he's going to get hauled
into the DA's office for questioning

30:29.900 --> 30:31.900
just because he has the bad luck
to work for me,

30:31.900 --> 30:34.700
then I want to be the one
to explain it to him.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.800
Hi. David, thank you
so much for coming.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.200
Yeah. Like I have a choice.

30:47.900 --> 30:50.000
Yeah, okay.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.700
I was born Arlo Slocumb.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.600
Mitchell Slocumb's my father.

30:54.600 --> 30:57.000
Was my father.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.300
So what do you want to know?

30:59.300 --> 31:00.800
I'm not going to be able
to tell you very much.

31:00.800 --> 31:04.400
I moved out before I was 17.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.900
As soon as I turned 21,
I changed my name.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.700
I, I don't think
I have any light to shed.

31:10.700 --> 31:13.100
Be that as it may,
I do need to ask you some questions,

31:13.100 --> 31:16.700
the most important being can you account
for your whereabouts Monday night?

31:16.700 --> 31:20.000
You mean the night
that my father was killed?

31:20.500 --> 31:21.800
Yeah...

31:21.800 --> 31:23.700
but no. I mean...

31:23.700 --> 31:27.300
I was at home, but there was
no one there with me.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.500
What about Debbie?
Your kids?

31:29.500 --> 31:32.700
They were visiting
with her sister in Flagstaff.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.600
Is that what this is?
Is that the working theory?

31:34.600 --> 31:37.400
You think I spent 20 years
hiding that I was his son

31:37.400 --> 31:42.800
so I could come back and kill him
and become notorious for it?

31:43.400 --> 31:46.800
Look, I don't know how to prove it, but
I didn't even know that he was in Phoenix

31:46.800 --> 31:49.200
until I saw the online report
that he was dead.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.200
I'm afraid that's not good enough,Mr. Brewer.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.400
I've got to find a way
to substantiate your alibi.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.700
Even in death

31:57.800 --> 32:01.500
the man is complicating my life.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.900
So what's next?
How do we do this?

32:04.900 --> 32:08.000
It's pretty straightforward stuff.
We fingerprint you.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.200
Look around your house
for a murder weapon.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.900
Talk to some people
who know you.

32:11.900 --> 32:14.300
Oh, man.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.200
Look.
I get it.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.100
I understand what you have to do.
I get it. I...

32:20.100 --> 32:22.600
All I'm saying is just...

32:23.000 --> 32:26.100
please be sensitive to my situation.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.600
Be discreet.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.100
I've spent a long time
building a life as David Brewer.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.200
I have a wife;
I have two kids

32:33.200 --> 32:37.100
who have no idea that their
grandfather was a mass murderer.

32:37.100 --> 32:40.100
I have a professional
reputation to protect.

32:40.100 --> 32:43.400
We understand, Mr. Brewer.
We'll do our best.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.900
Mom!
Daddy's on the TV!

32:50.900 --> 32:54.700
I was trying to find cartoons. But all
the channels had Daddy on them instead.

32:54.700 --> 32:58.100
Mr. Slocumb, is it true you've been living
under an assumed name since the 1980s?

32:58.100 --> 33:00.700
I don't have nothing to say about that.

33:03.300 --> 33:06.300
- Hello?
- Seen the news?

33:06.300 --> 33:07.600
Seen it?

33:07.600 --> 33:09.700
Lee, my God, this is terrible.

33:09.700 --> 33:13.100
This man's a friend.
He works for my husband.
We gave him our word.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.700
How did the press find out?

33:14.700 --> 33:17.200
Someone must have seen
my report, made a call.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.200
I'm guessing money changed hands.

33:19.200 --> 33:23.700
That poor man. All he did
was ask us to protect his privacy.

33:23.700 --> 33:26.800
You ready for the punch line?
It was all for naught.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.300
We found the man
who actually killed Slocumb.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.100
Name is Donald Wright.

33:31.100 --> 33:34.300
He ran with the same rightwing
nut jobs that Slocumb did.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.400
Turns out the two of them
had a fight over money.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.700
Ended with Wright taking a pipe
to his "buddy's" skull.

33:39.700 --> 33:44.000
David's completely innocent?
We questioned him for nothing.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
I'm afraid so.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.900
I wonder if it'll be any consolation to him
while the media's picking his life apart.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.500
No, okay. Yeah.

33:52.500 --> 33:55.700
No, I-I, yeah,
I understand.

33:55.900 --> 33:59.300
Look, if there's ever anything
that I can do for you...

33:59.800 --> 34:03.200
I'm so sorry.
I really am, David.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.200
What? What now?

34:07.200 --> 34:10.100
He just quit.
They're moving.

34:10.100 --> 34:11.900
Oh, God, no.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.500
Somebody threw a rock
through their window.

34:14.500 --> 34:18.199
He's been getting threatening
phone calls all night.

34:18.500 --> 34:20.300
The police have a car parked
outside of his house,

34:20.300 --> 34:23.600
but it's not like
they can stay there forever.

34:24.300 --> 34:26.500
He just wants out of here...

34:26.500 --> 34:28.699
and I can't blame him.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.100
I don't understand.
What is all this?

34:32.100 --> 34:35.699
If he's innocent, why am I
being shown all these things?

34:35.699 --> 34:38.900
So I can ruin the life
of a good man?

34:38.900 --> 34:41.500
You got me, Al.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.400
...number 13 takes it to the 49.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.000
Martin has got...

34:47.000 --> 34:48.600
Dad?

34:49.600 --> 34:52.600
I have something
I want to show you.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.900
What the hell is that?

35:02.200 --> 35:05.400
I found one of those new microwave
ovens over at the dump.

35:05.400 --> 35:09.500
It was pretty smashed up,
but the inside still worked.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.600
It gave me an idea.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.300
See, this is a timer.

35:13.300 --> 35:16.500
You just set it for
however long you need to get away.

35:16.500 --> 35:20.500
And this,
this thing gets really, really hot.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.800
You take all this,

35:22.800 --> 35:27.500
you put it in a vehicle filled
with gas and-and an oxidizer...

35:27.500 --> 35:31.200
Oxidizer?
What's an oxidizer?

35:31.200 --> 35:33.600
Fertilizer.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.500
You take 20 or 30 bags of fertilizer...

35:36.500 --> 35:38.400
And what?

35:38.400 --> 35:42.300
Well, I think
you could blow up a building.

35:53.600 --> 35:57.600
That's... beautiful, son.

35:59.100 --> 36:02.100
I could never build
something like that.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.400
Not in a million years.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.300
You always said you wanted
to change the world, Dad.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.800
now you can.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.100
Oh, my God,
what are you up to now?

36:42.100 --> 36:43.300
I'm fine. I'm fine.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.600
I'm not building anything.
I'm not blowing anything up.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.000
I'm just trying to find...

36:48.500 --> 36:50.200
Here it is.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.800
From a 20-year-old microwave.
I completely missed the point.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.500
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The point of what?

36:56.500 --> 36:57.800
The dreams, the compulsions.

36:57.800 --> 37:02.600
They had nothing to do with Mitchell Slocumb
trying to get me to blow up another courthouse.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.200
It had to do with seeing
how the bomb really got made

37:05.200 --> 37:08.100
so I could understand
who really made it.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.600
What do you mean,
"who really made it"?

37:10.600 --> 37:14.700
Mitchell Slocumb didn't build that bomb, Joe.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.100
His son did.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.200
Remember that night he came over for dinner?
He handed me that bottle of wine?

37:21.200 --> 37:23.500
As soon as I touched it,
I-I saw these images.

37:23.500 --> 37:27.300
These flashes of... pictures. Faces.

37:27.300 --> 37:31.600
I really didn't understand it at the time,
but now I'm starting to think...

37:32.900 --> 37:37.800
There they are.
There's 17 of them.

37:37.800 --> 37:41.300
I'm starting to think that I saw them
'cause they're always in his head.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.500
He's haunted by them.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.700
Okay, so let's say
that you're right.

37:45.700 --> 37:50.700
What are you gonna do? It-it's 23 years now.
The only other person who was there is dead.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.800
How exactly do you go
about proving any of this

37:53.800 --> 37:57.000
I mean, what do you do with it?

37:58.500 --> 38:01.200
I don't know.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.000
How do you do it?

38:14.400 --> 38:17.200
How do you live with yourself?

38:17.200 --> 38:19.600
How do you live with it
day in and day out?

38:19.600 --> 38:23.700
With 17 people's lives
on your conscience?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.700
I don't know what you're talking about.
Those people aren't on my conscience.

38:26.700 --> 38:30.100
My father detonated that bomb.
My father killed those people.

38:30.100 --> 38:34.400
Your father figured out how to use
microwave oven parts to build a detonator?

38:34.400 --> 38:37.900
You father knew to use
gasoline and fertilizer

38:37.900 --> 38:41.800
ten years before Timothy McVeigh
and the Oklahoma City bombing?

38:41.800 --> 38:46.200
Your father, who dropped out of high school
and went right into the army?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.900
I think I'd like you to leave now.

38:48.900 --> 38:52.300
I know you built it.
I know you made it.

38:52.300 --> 38:53.900
I know you gave it
to your father.

38:53.900 --> 38:59.000
And he drove it to California
and he murdered 17 people.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.900
17 people whose pictures you saw
in the newspaper the next morning.

39:03.900 --> 39:07.700
17 people whose faces
are etched in your mind.

39:07.700 --> 39:10.100
Whatever you say.

39:10.100 --> 39:13.300
But seeing as how there are no police
cars flooding this driveway,

39:13.300 --> 39:16.400
I don't see how you are
actually able to prove that.

39:16.400 --> 39:19.100
Well, you're right
I can't prove it.

39:19.100 --> 39:22.000
But the 17 people who died that day--

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
the people who loved them--

39:25.000 --> 39:27.300
they really deserve to know
what really happened.

39:27.300 --> 39:29.400
They-they know what happened.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.100
A misguided fool with mental
problems set off a bomb.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.900
And if it hadn't been that bomb,
it might have been another.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.500
Dynamite stolen
from a construction site,

39:37.500 --> 39:40.300
or a war-surplus hand grenade.

39:40.300 --> 39:44.600
Is that how you excuse
what you did?

39:47.200 --> 39:50.800
By the way, I think
your math's a little off.

39:51.700 --> 39:55.500
18 people died that day.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.600
A badly damaged boy
named Arlo Slocumb--

39:59.600 --> 40:02.600
he died in that blast, too.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.100
And out of his ashes...

40:07.100 --> 40:09.800
David Brewer was born.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.500
And while David Brewer
may sometimes think about

40:12.500 --> 40:15.400
some of the things
that Arlo Slocumb did,

40:16.400 --> 40:22.400
it'd be an unspeakable tragedy for him
to go to jail for that boy's crimes.

40:22.900 --> 40:24.600
I mean...

40:24.600 --> 40:28.800
what would be the point
of destroying one more family?

40:29.000 --> 40:33.200
- Sweetie. We really need to get going.
- I'll be right there.

40:39.600 --> 40:44.000
I'm sorry that we're not gonna able
to have that dinner, Allison.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.300
I really think you'd like me.

41:00.500 --> 41:05.300
It's always there, isn't it?

41:07.900 --> 41:10.600
Give Joe my best.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
