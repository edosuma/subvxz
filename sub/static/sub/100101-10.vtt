WEBVTT

00:01.712 --> 00:02.979
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:02.980 --> 00:05.746
I mean the pictures don't do it justice.

00:05.776 --> 00:08.009
- It's like a fairy tale.
- I know.

00:08.010 --> 00:10.211
How did you guys find this place?

00:10.235 --> 00:11.914
It was on Blake and
Trevor's short list.

00:11.915 --> 00:15.162
Yeah, but then Trevor decided
he wanted a water element, so...

00:15.163 --> 00:17.642
Are you two ever actually
going to get married?

00:17.666 --> 00:19.777
If we ever decide on how to do it,

00:19.801 --> 00:21.879
so maybe not. Anyway,

00:21.903 --> 00:24.349
I just looked up the ten most
romantic places near D.C.,

00:24.373 --> 00:27.318
- and this popped up.
- It kind of reminds me

00:27.342 --> 00:29.387
of the house at the farm, doesn't it?

00:29.411 --> 00:30.555
Maybe the barn.

00:30.579 --> 00:31.723
STEVIE: Okay, I know you guys

00:31.747 --> 00:33.992
wanted me to have
it there. I'm sorry.

00:34.016 --> 00:35.893
- No, no, no, no, no. 100%.
- Hey, we're venue neutral.

00:35.917 --> 00:37.462
STEVIE: Okay. We just
wanted this to be, like,

00:37.486 --> 00:38.830
our place, you know,

00:38.854 --> 00:40.098
not connected to anyone
else's history.

00:40.122 --> 00:42.834
And I don't really have
much of a history here,

00:42.858 --> 00:44.235
so everything works for me.

00:44.259 --> 00:46.604
- You like it, though, right?
- Oh, no, I love it.

00:46.628 --> 00:49.507
It reminds me of my
grandfather's house on the farm.

00:49.531 --> 00:52.399
Well, pictures I've seen,
before the state took it.

00:54.469 --> 00:56.114
I-I love it.

00:56.138 --> 00:58.149
Look at those beams.

00:58.173 --> 01:00.318
- STEVIE: Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:00.342 --> 01:02.020
So they're all hand-planed

01:02.044 --> 01:03.921
original timber, and the furniture

01:03.945 --> 01:06.357
in here is-is hand-hewn;
there's no nails.

01:06.381 --> 01:07.825
It's like we're standing in art.

01:07.849 --> 01:10.895
Oh. It so is.

01:10.919 --> 01:12.030
(EXCITED CHATTER)

01:12.054 --> 01:13.798
Are we ready to sample food?

01:13.822 --> 01:15.833
ELIZABETH: Oh, yes!
- Thank you, Maggie.

01:15.857 --> 01:17.135
Everything looks amazing.

01:17.159 --> 01:18.870
Maggie, it's so good to finally

01:18.894 --> 01:20.204
- meet you in person.
- Likewise.

01:20.228 --> 01:21.539
- This is place is spectacular, really.
- Beautiful place.

01:21.563 --> 01:23.708
Thank you so much. Oh, this
is a couple of late additions...

01:23.732 --> 01:25.176
- What do we have?
- ...from the caterer.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.213
Bacon-wrapped dates

01:26.237 --> 01:28.546
- and lobster mac and cheese.
- Yes! (GASPS)

01:28.570 --> 01:29.847
Showing some respect
for the flesh eaters.

01:29.871 --> 01:32.683
- And we love you for it.
- Oh, we do.

01:32.707 --> 01:35.520
Ma'am, those dishes
haven't been cleared.

01:35.544 --> 01:37.155
What-what do you mean?

01:37.179 --> 01:39.290
We oversaw production
of everything that's here.

01:39.314 --> 01:41.893
Those two haven't been vetted.

01:41.917 --> 01:44.128
So not the mac and...
I'm good to go, right?

01:44.152 --> 01:45.753
Yes, sir.

01:47.022 --> 01:48.332
STEVIE: Mmm.

01:48.356 --> 01:49.967
Crudités are okay?

01:49.991 --> 01:51.869
BOTH: Yes, ma'am.

01:51.893 --> 01:53.171
(STEVIE CHUCKLES)

01:53.195 --> 01:56.541
- This is by far the best.
- Oh, good.

01:56.565 --> 01:59.577
- This cake is unbelievable.
- That's really good.

01:59.601 --> 02:01.245
- How is it?
- It's terrible.

02:01.269 --> 02:03.648
- No, it's not good at all.
- You wouldn't like it at all.

02:03.672 --> 02:05.149
Okay, so this one?

02:05.173 --> 02:07.018
I want my own personal
vat at the wedding.

02:07.042 --> 02:08.652
I will see to it, but for now

02:08.676 --> 02:10.628
we should get to the White
House for the bill signing.

02:10.652 --> 02:11.459
Okay.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.724
You know, you could sort of
just grab one for yourself

02:13.748 --> 02:15.726
- and we could have it in the...
- No, ma'am.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.229
HENRY: Mmm, mmm, mmm.

02:18.253 --> 02:21.155
If you die, I won't eat it.

02:22.724 --> 02:24.335
MIKE: "A mere nine months
after President McCord was

02:24.359 --> 02:26.170
"threatened with impeachment,
an action which was impeded

"by the largest political protest

- Yes.

"Not present will be Mark Hanson

02:39.374 --> 02:40.985
and all of his traitorous

- Michael.
- Uh, we'll see.

"Also in attendance

02:48.316 --> 02:49.727
Hey, can you make sure that there's

02:49.751 --> 02:51.362
someone there to help her
down the stairs?

02:51.386 --> 02:52.530
Let's avoid any sudden noises.

02:52.554 --> 02:53.764
Dead old ladies aren't a great look

02:53.788 --> 02:56.100
- for female empowerment.
- She seems very spry.

02:56.124 --> 02:58.058
Her phone voice seems spry?

02:59.127 --> 03:01.639
Also, the soccer players.
I got an earful

03:01.663 --> 03:03.774
when I asked them to stick
to the talking points.

03:03.798 --> 03:06.177
All this stuff about
(STAMMERS) censorship

03:06.201 --> 03:08.045
and the importance of letting
women speak their truth.

03:08.069 --> 03:09.447
They do this all the time.

03:09.471 --> 03:11.949
I'm just saying maybe don't
stand so close to them when

03:11.973 --> 03:14.118
- the microphones are on.
- Too many powerful women for you?

03:14.142 --> 03:15.887
You've met my four sisters.
You know I have triggers.

03:15.911 --> 03:17.989
Yeah. Okay, go. Thank you so much.

03:18.013 --> 03:19.891
- Hi. Uh, maintenance missed the memo...
- Hi.

03:19.915 --> 03:22.426
- ...on fertilizing the Rose Garden.
- (CHUCKLES)

03:22.450 --> 03:24.629
So the olfactory consensus
is that we should

03:24.653 --> 03:26.230
hold the bill signing in here,

03:26.254 --> 03:28.533
additional photo sessions
in the portrait gallery

03:28.557 --> 03:30.768
- to make room for more press.
- Okay. That's great.

03:30.792 --> 03:33.604
And (EXHALES) one small thing
I need to discuss with you

03:33.628 --> 03:34.772
about the wedding.

03:34.796 --> 03:37.942
(GASPS) Oh, my God.

03:37.966 --> 03:40.545
My daughter's
getting married, Russell!

03:40.569 --> 03:44.015
In two days. That's, like,
the day after tomorrow.

03:44.039 --> 03:45.183
Yes, yes.

03:45.207 --> 03:47.518
It is exactly like that. Uh...

03:47.542 --> 03:49.420
I know you got enough on your mind

03:49.444 --> 03:51.022
without last-minute requests,

03:51.046 --> 03:55.793
but I have to ask you
not to seat me with Carol.

03:55.817 --> 03:58.596
Okay. Why?

03:58.620 --> 04:01.098
Because things haven't been
going so well lately,

04:01.122 --> 04:04.525
and she would rather be
at a distance from me.

04:07.262 --> 04:09.340
I mean, how serious is it?

04:09.364 --> 04:12.543
I'm at a hotel.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.512
Oh, no.

04:14.536 --> 04:17.781
Nah. I've been there before.

04:17.805 --> 04:21.252
Named a suite for me at the Mayfair.

04:21.276 --> 04:23.054
Blows over eventually.

04:23.078 --> 04:24.956
Oh, Russell, I'm so sorry.

04:24.980 --> 04:27.992
Sort of afraid to ask:

04:28.016 --> 04:30.117
Is it because of the job?

04:32.053 --> 04:34.865
It's not not because of the job.

04:34.889 --> 04:36.367
I don't know how I could've

04:36.391 --> 04:39.760
gotten through any of this
without you, you know.

04:42.797 --> 04:44.365
I feel bad.

04:46.268 --> 04:48.579
You know, maybe I
should talk to Carol.

04:48.603 --> 04:50.081
Oh, God, no.

04:50.105 --> 04:53.407
The only person she likes
less than me right now is you.

04:54.909 --> 04:57.788
Well, how long has
this been going on?

Carol!

05:07.455 --> 05:09.066
Call the gardener!

05:09.090 --> 05:11.168
- It's out of the question.
- It's temporary.

05:11.192 --> 05:12.703
Dalton was temporary.

05:12.727 --> 05:15.072
- Only the second term.
- What's your point?

05:15.096 --> 05:17.241
- This is different!
- It's always different.

05:17.265 --> 05:19.210
Except it's never different.

05:19.234 --> 05:21.345
You had a heart attack, Russell.

05:21.369 --> 05:23.347
- You almost died.
- Yeah, and her daughter saved my life.

05:23.371 --> 05:25.016
So you owe her?

05:25.040 --> 05:26.437
Oh, come on,
the first woman president, Carol.

05:26.438 --> 05:27.681
Don't you dare!

05:27.682 --> 05:29.620
Just to get her on solid ground,
and then I promise...

05:29.644 --> 05:32.990
No. You have lost the right
to promise me anything.

05:33.014 --> 05:34.358
And you know what?

05:34.382 --> 05:37.528
Your thousand broken promises
aren't even the real problem.

05:37.552 --> 05:41.198
The real problem is that I have
always come second to your job.

05:41.222 --> 05:44.635
You have never once chosen me first,

05:44.659 --> 05:46.304
and you never will.

05:46.328 --> 05:48.472
It's not a competition, Carol.

05:48.496 --> 05:50.775
Not anymore it isn't.

05:50.799 --> 05:52.466
I quit.

05:58.535 --> 06:01.141
EPFL PSA, take one.

06:03.278 --> 06:04.655
Welcome, everybody.

their voices to this cause.

ASHLYN: We're honored to
be here, Madam President.

06:22.731 --> 06:25.509
We've been speaking out about
pay equity for a long time

06:25.533 --> 06:28.212
in our own profession, but
the problem is everywhere.

06:28.236 --> 06:29.714
CRYSTAL: The average American woman

06:29.738 --> 06:32.783
makes only 82 cents for
every dollar earned by men.

06:32.807 --> 06:34.819
And it's even worse for minorities.

06:34.843 --> 06:37.988
African American women
make 63 cents on the dollar.

06:38.012 --> 06:40.725
That's why we always
say, "Equal work..."

06:40.749 --> 06:43.160
OTHERS: "Equal sweat, equal pay."
- Ah.

06:43.184 --> 06:44.829
ALLIE: You could steal that
phrase, Madam President.

06:44.853 --> 06:46.731
ELIZABETH: Well, I just
might take you up on that.

06:46.755 --> 06:50.101
And this act also provides
for spousal leave.

06:50.125 --> 06:51.435
ALI: We love that,

06:51.459 --> 06:54.171
whether your partner's
your husband or your wife.

06:54.195 --> 06:55.973
And cut.

06:55.997 --> 06:57.708
Thank you, ladies.
That was wonderful.

06:57.732 --> 06:59.377
(LAUGHS): So sorry about that.

06:59.401 --> 07:00.911
That's right, you guys got married.

07:00.935 --> 07:02.246
Congratulations.

07:02.270 --> 07:04.949
Thank you. We did it. (LAUGHS)
- Yeah. We took the plunge.

07:04.973 --> 07:06.283
Aw. We are

07:06.307 --> 07:08.052
having a wedding...

07:08.076 --> 07:10.087
Well, we-we're married,
but our daughter Stevie

07:10.111 --> 07:11.355
is getting married in two days.

07:11.379 --> 07:12.990
- Two days?
- Oh, wow.

07:13.014 --> 07:14.492
You both seem really relaxed.

07:14.516 --> 07:16.627
Well, it's all just
a very well-rehearsed act.

07:16.651 --> 07:18.863
But I'm glad to see that
it's working. (LAUGHS)

BLAKE: Madam President.

07:20.054 --> 07:23.100
This is our special guest, Flo Avery.

07:23.124 --> 07:26.103
Ms. Avery, it is
an honor to meet you.

07:26.127 --> 07:28.005
Call me Flo.

07:28.029 --> 07:29.940
Well, thank you, I will.

07:29.964 --> 07:34.245
Uh, ladies, I want you to meet
Ms. Avery... Flo,

07:34.269 --> 07:37.681
who was born on August 18th, 1920,

07:37.705 --> 07:40.651
the exact day that
the 19th Amendment was ratified.

07:40.675 --> 07:43.654
- Such an honor to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

examples of female leadership,

08:01.095 --> 08:03.073
Thank you for being here today.

08:03.097 --> 08:04.909
Thank you.

08:04.933 --> 08:07.011
You guys, thanks for being here.

08:07.035 --> 08:08.612
I really appreciate it.

08:08.636 --> 08:10.548
Thank you, everyone. Right this way.

08:10.572 --> 08:11.882
We will, uh, pick this up

08:11.906 --> 08:13.584
in the portrait gallery...
quick as you can.

08:13.608 --> 08:15.075
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

08:16.811 --> 08:21.648
Madam President, I just
wanted to tell you that...

08:23.551 --> 08:25.963
- May I sit, please?
- Y-Yes, please.

08:25.987 --> 08:29.500
I never thought
I'd live to see the day

08:29.524 --> 08:35.105
when we would have a woman president.

08:35.129 --> 08:38.676
Well, I'm very glad
that you did. (CHUCKLES)

08:38.700 --> 08:42.379
However, now that I have,

08:42.403 --> 08:44.648
I couldn't be more disappointed.

08:44.672 --> 08:47.685
Oh. Um...

08:47.709 --> 08:50.521
Don't be patting yourself
too hard on the back

08:50.545 --> 08:54.158
about this-this little bill.

08:54.182 --> 08:58.929
It was passed by a house full of men.

08:58.953 --> 09:02.399
And it can be taken away
just as easily.

09:02.423 --> 09:06.670
It's baked right into
the Declaration of Independence

09:06.694 --> 09:10.641
that all <i>men...</i>

09:10.665 --> 09:12.643
are created equal.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.079
And look what happened to the ERA.

09:15.103 --> 09:18.349
Couldn't even get it
ratified by the states.

09:18.373 --> 09:22.386
Equal Pay Act, my foot.

09:22.410 --> 09:26.957
The Emancipation Proclamation
didn't end slavery.

09:26.981 --> 09:30.951
The 13th Amendment did.

09:32.420 --> 09:35.332
As long as the Constitution
doesn't guarantee

09:35.356 --> 09:37.124
my equality...

09:39.027 --> 09:42.129
...I see no reason to celebrate.

09:45.533 --> 09:48.012
But...

09:48.036 --> 09:50.303
thanks for the pen.

09:55.176 --> 09:58.656
(QUIETLY): Hi. Uh, the venue
just went down in flames.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.358
I know. Did you see that coming?

10:01.382 --> 10:02.993
- Because I sure didn't.
- No.

10:03.017 --> 10:05.095
Mike was worried about
the soccer players.

10:05.119 --> 10:07.898
I just got my ass handed to me
by a centenarian.

10:07.922 --> 10:10.457
No, the wedding venue just
burned down to the ground.

10:12.427 --> 10:14.905
(SIGHS): Oh, come on.

10:14.929 --> 10:22.115
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

10:26.003 --> 10:27.103
Well?

10:27.508 --> 10:29.686
Well, unfortunately,
all that beautiful, original

10:29.710 --> 10:31.688
hand-hewn timber made
excellent kindling.

10:31.712 --> 10:33.752
The place burned to the
ground in less than an hour.

10:33.753 --> 10:36.001
- Fortunately, no one was hurt.
- Okay.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.246
Well, we still have the caterer,

10:37.270 --> 10:39.453
so we can just go full-court
press on another venue.

10:39.454 --> 10:41.599
All right, well,
what about postponing?

10:41.623 --> 10:43.267
No. That's impossible.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.770
People are already on their way in.

10:45.794 --> 10:47.872
They've made hotel reservations,
their schedules.

10:47.896 --> 10:49.340
It's a logistical nightmare.

10:49.364 --> 10:51.542
We can't just...
But we-we don't want to wait.

10:51.566 --> 10:52.877
- Like...
- HENRY: Just keep making lists

10:52.901 --> 10:54.678
and calls until we find a new venue.

10:54.702 --> 10:55.900
There's got to be
some place that'll work.

10:55.924 --> 10:57.782
- ELIZABETH: Right.
- Afraid that is not an option.

10:57.806 --> 11:00.117
It takes three weeks
minimum to clear a location.

11:00.141 --> 11:01.819
Can't we make some kind
of emergency exception?

11:01.843 --> 11:04.121
I mean, there has to be a
way around the protocol.

11:04.145 --> 11:06.056
Oh, yeah, in fact there is:
You can get married

11:06.080 --> 11:08.492
anywhere you like
as long as your mother

11:08.516 --> 11:10.795
doesn't come to the wedding.

11:10.819 --> 11:12.663
- Don't even think about it. No.
- I'm not.

11:12.687 --> 11:15.599
All right, look, in
terms of secure venues,

11:15.623 --> 11:17.868
here are your options: Camp David...

11:17.892 --> 11:19.470
which has been dealing
with an infestation

11:19.494 --> 11:21.605
- of West Nile mosquitos...
- Great.

11:21.629 --> 11:23.774
...and the White House.

11:23.798 --> 11:25.409
That's it? That's...

11:25.433 --> 11:28.502
Mount Weather,
if you like a windowless bunker.

11:31.639 --> 11:33.384
So much for keeping it apolitical.

11:33.408 --> 11:35.075
(CHUCKLES): I mean...

11:36.010 --> 11:37.488
Listen to me.

11:37.512 --> 11:40.124
Your dad and I are gonna do
everything in our power

11:40.148 --> 11:42.259
- to protect this wedding.
- Mm.

11:42.283 --> 11:44.161
I mean it.

11:44.185 --> 11:49.366
There will be no press and
absolutely no politics.

11:49.390 --> 11:51.068
It's a political gold mine!
Invitations will be

11:51.092 --> 11:52.743
more sought after than Willy
Wonka's golden tickets!

11:52.767 --> 11:53.591
No!

11:53.592 --> 11:55.372
There will be no political
interference in this wedding.

11:55.396 --> 11:57.675
Is that clear? End of discussion.

11:57.699 --> 11:58.976
Just keep the announcement simple

11:59.000 --> 12:00.878
and stress it'll be a low-key event

12:00.902 --> 12:02.379
- for family and friends.
- Yes, sir.

12:02.403 --> 12:03.848
Thank you. That's all.

12:03.872 --> 12:05.316
Actually, it's not.

12:05.340 --> 12:06.917
I've just been talking with Jody,

12:06.941 --> 12:08.853
our Women's Outreach director,

12:08.877 --> 12:11.422
and I do have something else
I want to discuss.

12:11.446 --> 12:14.492
After my trip to the
woodshed with Flo Avery

12:14.516 --> 12:18.518
at the signing ceremony, I've
been thinking about the ERA.

12:19.787 --> 12:22.466
Were you also thinking about
mood rings and Supertramp?

12:22.490 --> 12:25.469
Flo Avery was right.

12:25.493 --> 12:28.138
An amendment to the
Constitution is the only way

12:28.162 --> 12:30.699
- to make civil liberties permanent.
- Oh, no...

12:30.723 --> 12:32.943
I think it's a mistake.
It's a dead horse.

12:32.967 --> 12:35.813
A lot of people don't even
know the history of it.

12:35.837 --> 12:37.781
Worst-case scenario:

12:37.805 --> 12:39.884
they get an important civics lesson.

12:39.908 --> 12:42.019
What are they gonna do, impeach me?

12:42.043 --> 12:43.487
- Oh...
- Oh, all right, okay.

12:43.511 --> 12:46.457
I think it could get traction,
particularly with young people.

12:46.481 --> 12:48.459
- You mean the non-voting bloc?
- Not just kids.

12:48.483 --> 12:49.960
40-and-under.

12:49.984 --> 12:51.695
It's not a dead horse to them.

12:51.719 --> 12:53.497
It could be a brand-new pony.

12:53.521 --> 12:54.788
I love it.

12:57.158 --> 12:59.203
(THUMPS DESK) Saddle up.

12:59.227 --> 13:01.261
And get happy.

13:02.697 --> 13:04.508
ELIZABETH: Good afternoon.
- OTHERS: Good afternoon.

13:04.532 --> 13:06.010
I am here today to announce

13:06.034 --> 13:08.445
that I am reviving
the ERA initiative.

13:08.469 --> 13:10.981
The first Equal Rights Amendment
was introduced

13:11.005 --> 13:13.484
in Congress in 1923,

13:13.508 --> 13:18.155
and subsequently reintroduced
in every session of Congress

13:18.179 --> 13:20.457
for half a century,

13:20.481 --> 13:23.727
until it finally passed
both houses of Congress

13:23.751 --> 13:25.229
in the early 1970s.

13:25.253 --> 13:28.365
But then it was only ratified
by 35 states.

13:28.389 --> 13:30.134
It needed 38 to pass.

13:30.158 --> 13:33.904
Since then, our society has made

13:33.928 --> 13:37.374
so much progress
toward equality of the sexes.

13:37.398 --> 13:41.111
It is about time
we update the Constitution

13:41.135 --> 13:45.115
to reflect the reality that
all people are created equal

13:45.139 --> 13:48.552
and shall be treated so
under the law.

13:48.576 --> 13:51.522
The thing is, language matters.

13:51.546 --> 13:53.791
And the language of our Constitution

13:53.815 --> 13:56.026
doesn't go far enough
to recognize the rights

13:56.050 --> 13:57.728
of all our citizens.

13:57.752 --> 13:59.029
Not yet.

13:59.053 --> 14:02.299
So I invite the American people
to join me

14:02.323 --> 14:04.902
in this overdue campaign
for inclusion.

14:04.926 --> 14:06.236
Thank you.

14:06.260 --> 14:08.105
HENRY: <i>Hey.</i>

14:08.129 --> 14:10.841
Oh, wow. That looks
like something important.

14:10.865 --> 14:12.843
ELIZABETH: It's a seating chart.

14:12.867 --> 14:15.068
Stevie's letting me help her with it.

14:16.704 --> 14:18.716
(EXHALES) Wow.

14:18.740 --> 14:20.718
Our daughter is getting married.

14:20.742 --> 14:22.052
I know.

14:22.076 --> 14:24.688
We're gonna have a son-in-law.

14:24.712 --> 14:26.023
- HENRY: Yeah, I'm up to speed.
- Hey.

14:26.047 --> 14:28.158
- It's me with an annoying update.
- ELIZABETH: Can't wait.

14:28.182 --> 14:31.462
Your new ERA initiative is
facing a vocal public opposition

14:31.486 --> 14:33.931
from none other than
Ohio Senator Amy Ross,

14:33.955 --> 14:35.799
who is vowing to fight
you in the Senate.

14:35.823 --> 14:37.701
AMY: This would be
a gratuitous alteration

14:37.725 --> 14:39.136
of the Constitution.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.338
And it's entirely unnecessary.

14:41.362 --> 14:47.077
We should all be wary of rushing
to alter this sacred document.

14:47.101 --> 14:48.512
President McCord

14:48.536 --> 14:50.914
is trying to stoke a political fight

14:50.938 --> 14:52.816
that will pointlessly
divide this country

14:52.840 --> 14:54.418
along gender lines.

14:54.442 --> 14:57.788
I intend to stop it
dead in its tracks.

14:57.812 --> 14:59.012
(REPORTERS CLAMOR)

15:02.724 --> 15:03.759
MIKE: <i>So, item next.</i>

15:03.760 --> 15:06.539
Heads-up from the IC that a
coup is imminent in Venezuela.

15:06.563 --> 15:08.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How imminent?

15:08.732 --> 15:10.777
Well, General Julio
Diaz has established

15:10.801 --> 15:12.846
a resistance movement
and is publicly demanding

15:12.870 --> 15:15.081
major concessions from
President Alvarado

15:15.105 --> 15:17.772
by tomorrow, or he's
threatening to unleash

15:17.773 --> 15:19.452
a civil war to topple the government,

15:19.476 --> 15:21.688
which could put our regional
agreement in jeopardy

15:21.712 --> 15:23.940
just in time for the
first daughter's nuptials.

15:23.941 --> 15:24.991
The hell it will.

15:25.015 --> 15:27.160
Oh, wait, do you guys have a second
to talk about wedding logistics?

15:27.184 --> 15:28.828
- I live for it.
- What's the problem now?

15:28.852 --> 15:30.063
I-It's not really a problem, really.

15:30.087 --> 15:31.731
It's just that ever
since this has become

15:31.755 --> 15:33.399
a White House wedding, everybody is

15:33.423 --> 15:36.035
angling for a ticket;
I'm being flooded with requests.

15:36.059 --> 15:39.639
Wouldn't that be a wonderful way
to lobby for the ERA votes?

15:39.663 --> 15:41.274
Against the backdrop of
a traditional wedding ceremony?

15:41.298 --> 15:43.343
As if to say,
"See? We can all be equal

15:43.367 --> 15:45.111
"and still participate
in a time-tested,

15:45.135 --> 15:46.946
"ancient, sexist ritual,

15:46.970 --> 15:49.149
wherein a virginally attired woman
is passed from one man to another."

15:49.173 --> 15:50.250
- That is not what...
- No!

15:50.274 --> 15:53.019
The invite list is locked.
What did I say?

15:53.043 --> 15:55.511
We are not politicizing this wedding.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.214
And nobody's having a damn coup.

15:59.383 --> 16:01.984
He's starting to scare me.

16:04.288 --> 16:05.732
Senator Ross.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.033
Good to see you.

16:07.057 --> 16:09.469
Amy. And it's always good to see you.

16:09.493 --> 16:11.371
The Armed Services
Committee is grateful

16:11.395 --> 16:13.206
for the work you do with the V.A.

16:13.230 --> 16:15.441
Oh. Thanks. I'm glad to hear that.

16:15.465 --> 16:17.043
I'm on my way to the president now.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.344
Little early.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.770
Well, I hope you have
a productive talk.

16:22.005 --> 16:23.917
Henry?

16:23.941 --> 16:26.352
Just curious.
What's your take on this?

16:26.376 --> 16:28.944
I'm 100% on board.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.858
Well, of course you'd have to be.

16:31.882 --> 16:34.527
No. I'm a liberated

16:34.551 --> 16:35.795
first gentleman.

16:35.819 --> 16:37.530
Even though the 14th Amendment

16:37.554 --> 16:40.366
- already guarantees women equal rights?
- Theoretically,

16:40.390 --> 16:43.136
it guarantees equal pay, but
that hasn't worked out so well.

16:43.160 --> 16:46.439
I am concerned that the
ERA will strip women

16:46.463 --> 16:48.274
of all of the legislative protections

16:48.298 --> 16:50.243
that we fought tooth and nail

16:50.267 --> 16:52.645
to enact: Social Security benefits

16:52.669 --> 16:54.380
for stay-at-home moms, which I was,

16:54.404 --> 16:56.916
and widows, which I am.

16:56.940 --> 16:59.652
Uh, food subsidies.
Uh, workplace safety.

16:59.676 --> 17:01.187
They're only necessary

17:01.211 --> 17:03.923
to try to help level
an uneven playing field.

17:03.947 --> 17:05.858
(CHUCKLES): No. They're necessary

17:05.882 --> 17:08.627
because of 10,000 years of evolution.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.829
Men and women aren't the same,

17:10.854 --> 17:13.333
no matter how much
we'd like to make it so.

17:13.357 --> 17:16.703
Sometimes separate is good.

17:16.727 --> 17:19.906
But the proponents of the ERA,
uh, don't...

17:19.930 --> 17:22.008
don't acknowledge that truth.

17:22.031 --> 17:24.444
And opponents
don't acknowledge that separate

17:24.468 --> 17:27.981
is so often used as a pretext
to prevent equality.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.649
This isn't about sexism.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.417
It's about reality.

17:31.441 --> 17:34.921
The worst thing about this
crusade is that it won't work.

17:34.945 --> 17:37.257
It won't fundamentally change biology

17:37.281 --> 17:39.792
or the requirements of motherhood

17:39.816 --> 17:42.528
or, uh, how men and women interact.

17:42.552 --> 17:45.398
Because men and women are different.

17:45.422 --> 17:46.633
Yes.

17:46.657 --> 17:49.902
But different doesn't mean inferior.

17:49.926 --> 17:52.939
And women have been fighting
to prove that they're not

17:52.963 --> 17:55.131
since the inception of this country.

17:56.066 --> 17:57.644
I find it odd

17:57.668 --> 18:00.246
that the first female
president can't acknowledge

18:00.270 --> 18:02.582
the tremendous, tremendous
progress we've made...

18:02.606 --> 18:04.317
Of course she acknowledges it,

18:04.341 --> 18:06.352
but she also knows that
we can't keep fighting

18:06.376 --> 18:08.288
case by case and bill by bill.

18:08.312 --> 18:09.789
Laws can be overturned,

18:09.813 --> 18:11.858
which is why we need
to make equal stature

18:11.882 --> 18:15.061
a fundamental tenet of our society.

18:15.085 --> 18:17.130
If the president overreaches,

18:17.154 --> 18:19.622
she can't know what the cost will be.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.101
You have grandsons, right?

18:22.125 --> 18:23.403
Four.

18:23.427 --> 18:25.238
Didn't I read somewhere

18:25.262 --> 18:29.542
that one of them won a
national debate championship?

18:29.566 --> 18:31.344
Jonathan, yes. He's a...

18:31.368 --> 18:33.913
he's gifted in rhetoric and argument.

18:35.539 --> 18:37.850
Yeah, um, because it
was modeled for him

18:37.874 --> 18:39.352
by a great woman.

18:39.376 --> 18:41.521
Can you imagine how
proud he'd be to know

18:41.545 --> 18:44.524
that all of the opportunities
that you fought so hard for

18:44.548 --> 18:45.825
were enshrined in the Constitution,

18:45.849 --> 18:47.327

18:48.785 --> 18:50.953

18:53.223 --> 18:56.292

18:57.527 --> 18:58.905
Not bad with the rhetoric yourself.

Oh, wait till you get
a load of my wife.

19:06.903 --> 19:10.016

to drive with Dad and me.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.984
That means a lot. It's very sweet.

- Thank you.
- Yeah. Well, I, um...

19:13.877 --> 19:16.222
I thought that it would
give us a chance to talk.

19:16.246 --> 19:17.957
- Absolutely. What's on your mind?
- Oh, listen,

19:17.981 --> 19:19.959
sweetheart, no matter how old you get

19:19.983 --> 19:22.095
or how many kids
of your own you have,

19:22.119 --> 19:25.331
you can always come to us
with anything, about anything.

19:25.355 --> 19:27.567
- I know. I know.
- Well, except for little problems in your marriage.

19:27.591 --> 19:29.902
- It's not good to triangulate, so...
- Well, no, not the little things.

19:29.926 --> 19:31.671
- You know, but everything else.
- I just mean it's better for...

19:31.695 --> 19:33.406

- That's what I'm saying.

- Henry, I'm saying the big...
- I mean, if she leaves the toilet seat up...

19:35.766 --> 19:37.610

Okay. Um...

19:53.150 --> 19:55.194
Senator Ross is being
pretty intractable,

19:55.218 --> 19:57.063
and without the support
of her caucus,

19:57.087 --> 19:58.564
it's an uphill battle.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.633
- We don't have to think about that now.
- So, that's... Yeah.

20:00.657 --> 20:01.768
No.

20:01.792 --> 20:04.270
I heard that, you know,
everybody in town

20:04.294 --> 20:06.305
is, like, angling for
an invitation to the wedding,

20:06.329 --> 20:07.673
and that would kind of be,

20:07.697 --> 20:09.509
like, a really good way
to whip votes.

20:09.533 --> 20:12.136
- We would never let that happen.
- No, we wouldn't. Never.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.679
- Don't... Are you worried about that?
- Because...

20:13.703 --> 20:16.082
I think maybe you should.

20:16.106 --> 20:19.352
I talked to Dmitri about it,
and we agree.

20:19.376 --> 20:23.322
I mean, we can't think
of a better way to...

20:23.346 --> 20:25.758
honor our future family, you know?

20:25.782 --> 20:29.018
Especially if we end up
having some baby women.

- Why can't...

calling, Mr. Jackson,

20:54.678 --> 20:57.190
but it will be to no avail,
let me assure you.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.192
The president has received
his ultimatum,

20:59.216 --> 21:01.194
and now it is time for action.

Well, I'm not calling
about any of that.

21:02.986 --> 21:04.997
I just, uh,
I just wanted to invite you

21:05.021 --> 21:06.799
to a wedding at the White House.

21:06.823 --> 21:07.649
A wedding?

It's the hottest ticket in town.

21:12.762 --> 21:15.741
We'll have to get you
on a plane right away, so...

21:15.765 --> 21:19.412
that means you'll have to
postpone plans for the weekend.

21:19.436 --> 21:24.617
But, hey, White House wedding's
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

21:24.641 --> 21:27.386
Sadly, the same
can't be said of a coup.

21:27.410 --> 21:29.355

21:38.355 --> 21:40.333
Oh, trust me. That's what I'm doing.

21:40.357 --> 21:42.602
If he's at the wedding,
he won't be able

21:42.626 --> 21:46.172

destabilize the region,

everything but the wedding vows.
