00:02.569 --> 00:05.333
<i>Hikers aren't supposed to let
their dogs off the leash back here.</i>

00:05.405 --> 00:09.239
But I'm pretty sure the dog was running free
when he found the... what he found.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.300
- What's the condition of the body?
- No idea.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.642
- Can't get close enough to examine it.
- Why not?

00:13.713 --> 00:16.146
<i>- The dog's definitely not on his leash at this time.
- [Dog Growling]</i>

00:16.216 --> 00:18.150
- Oh.
- Put down the bone.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.152
<i>[Booth]
How the hell are we gonna get to the body?</i>

00:20.220 --> 00:22.154
<i>- Buddy, drop it.
- You don't see that every day.</i>

00:22.222 --> 00:25.123
<i>Sent for animal control.
Take another hour though.</i>

00:25.191 --> 00:29.491
<i>Drop it now! I'm so sorry.
He's never done anything like this.</i>

00:29.562 --> 00:31.496
You ever have a dog, Bones?

00:31.564 --> 00:33.464
- I always wanted a pig.
- A pig?

00:33.533 --> 00:36.934
Very smart, and despite the popular
misconception, very clean.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.904
I prefer my pig with a little mint,
a little honey glaze...

00:39.973 --> 00:43.739
Not funny. In some cultures,
dogs can guard corpses...

00:43.810 --> 00:46.938
sometimes to the point of starvation,
so shoot it.

00:47.013 --> 00:50.471
I'm not shooting him for just
doing what comes naturally.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.609
As far as he's concerned,
you know, finder's keepers.

00:52.685 --> 00:57.122
That dog is compromising the integrity
of my remains, so wing it... him.

00:57.190 --> 00:59.283
<i>[Booth]
There's another way, Bones.</i>

00:59.359 --> 01:01.759
Dogs love me.

01:01.828 --> 01:04.489
Nice doggy.
Good pooch.

01:04.563 --> 01:08.864
Ah! Nice doggy.
Good pooch.

01:08.935 --> 01:12.837
- [Barking]
- Oh! Hey, we're just gonna wait for animal control.

01:14.541 --> 01:16.668
- I'll do it. [Whistles]
- Oh, yeah.

01:17.944 --> 01:21.971
- Yeah. A pinecone's really gonna work.
- Buddy! Buddy!

01:22.048 --> 01:23.982
- Okay.
- Come back here!

01:24.050 --> 01:26.280
I need everybody to clear the area.
Set up a perimeter.

01:26.352 --> 01:29.185
Clear the area!
Let's set up a perimeter.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.122
- And tell animal control I'll need that bone back.
- Right.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.285
First thing I'll do
when they get here.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.292
<i>[Brennan]
Victim was female, late teens.</i>

01:43.369 --> 01:46.668
Blonde. Cause of death looks like
blunt trauma to the back of the skull.

01:46.739 --> 01:49.970
- She was buried facedown.
- What's that, some satanic hoo-ha?

01:50.043 --> 01:55.504
My Uncle Preston wants to be buried
standing up without a casket.

01:55.582 --> 01:59.245
Pupal casings and insect remains suggest
she was buried out there seven to 10 years ago.

01:59.319 --> 02:02.811
<i>Placement of wrists and ankles
suggest she was bound.</i>

02:02.889 --> 02:05.858
<i>Residue on the medial malleolus
might tell us what restraints were used.</i>

02:05.925 --> 02:10.328
- Look at that.
- Wear to her right lateral
epicondyle and rotator cuff.

02:10.395 --> 02:13.854
<i>Also, repetitive motion damage
to the lower lumbar vertebrae.</i>

02:13.933 --> 02:16.060
- What's that mean?
- Golf?

02:18.171 --> 02:21.038
Hi, Angela.
You look great today.

02:21.107 --> 02:24.008
Thanks, Hodgie.
This is my " boho, rocker, artist...

02:24.077 --> 02:26.409
<i>midweek,
take-a-deep-breath-and-pout" look.</i>

02:26.479 --> 02:28.504
Hodgie?

02:28.581 --> 02:32.540
Uh, I did a facial reconstruction...

02:32.619 --> 02:35.179
extrapolating skin tone
from hair color.

02:35.255 --> 02:38.053
<i>For the record, I hate
the guy who killed this girl...</i>

02:38.124 --> 02:40.183
<i>and I hope to hell
he burns in all eternity.</i>

02:40.260 --> 02:45.596
- That our victim?
- I found flecks of black enamel paint in the wound.

02:45.665 --> 02:49.692
- Shape suggests a tire iron.
- Tire iron.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.703
[Screams]

02:51.771 --> 02:56.731
Tire iron.
Hands and feet bound, buried facedown.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.608
Epps.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.877
Hello?
New team member in the room.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.043
Howard Epps,
a serial killer on death row.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.781
- Killed at least three.
- We found two of'em last year.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.824
<i>Thejudge stayed his execution
to try him on the new charges.</i>

03:11.891 --> 03:14.382
You saved his life. Ironic.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.088
<i>The time frame fits.
This girl would've been killed...</i>

03:17.163 --> 03:19.791
about six months before
Epps went to prison.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.835
- Run her through the database, get an I.D.
- Why don't you just ask him?

03:22.902 --> 03:26.565
Because last time Bones saw Epps,
it got violent.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.802
<i>- You'll be there to protect her.
- She's not the one who needs protecting.</i>

03:29.876 --> 03:31.810
Bones broke his wrist.

03:35.481 --> 03:38.473
He touched me with his creepy
serial killer hands.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.076
Better not take Dr. Brennan.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.180
<i>[Door Buzzing]</i>

03:49.562 --> 03:53.020
Agent Booth.
What took you so long?

03:56.603 --> 03:58.594
And where's Dr. Brennan?

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074

04:40.246 --> 04:42.180
Who's this?

04:42.248 --> 04:44.716
Oh! That's right.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.480
You're chained.
[Chuckles]

04:47.553 --> 04:49.680
How about removing these shackles?

04:49.756 --> 04:52.748
The name, Howie.
The name.

04:55.895 --> 04:59.092
You know...

04:59.165 --> 05:02.259
those hack doctors
at the prison infirmary...

05:02.335 --> 05:04.701
did a miserable job
setting my wrist.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.763
It aches all the time, and I don't have
a full range of movement.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.936
And let me tell you, when you're stuck
in a prison cell for 23 hours a day...

05:12.011 --> 05:15.037
there's really only one thing
you can do to pass the time.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.550
And I need my wrist.

05:18.618 --> 05:22.884
<i>Well, I'm sure Dr. Brennan
would be happy to re-break it for you.</i>

05:24.624 --> 05:26.854
<i>- What's that?
- What, these?</i>

05:26.926 --> 05:30.293
These are crime scene photos,
the ones you like.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.422
<i>Tell you what.
You, uh...</i>

05:32.498 --> 05:37.197
You tell me the girl's name,
I'll, uh, let you take a look.

05:37.270 --> 05:40.467
Everything you need to win the game
is right there in front of you.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.100
Game?
[Scoffs]

05:43.176 --> 05:45.770
You're bored, huh?
Are you playing us?

05:45.845 --> 05:50.111
When Dr. Brennan figures it out,
come and see me again.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.208
But bring your lady scientist.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.220
Otherwise, I don't say a word.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.222
Next time you see
either one of us...

05:57.290 --> 05:59.884
they'll be giving you
a lethal injection.

06:12.638 --> 06:16.301
- Classic game theory.
Throwing down of the gauntlet.
- What?

06:16.376 --> 06:19.072
Conflict of interest arises
followed by a series of moves...

06:19.145 --> 06:21.909
- from which divergent strategies can be discerned.
- What did he say?

06:21.981 --> 06:24.643
- Epps is playing us.
- Yes. That's exactly what I said.

06:24.717 --> 06:28.483
Zero sum, obviously. After a few moves,
we'll know Epps's order of preference.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.022
- What did he say?
- We'll find out what Epps wants.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.115
<i>Look, I already know what he wants.
I told you.</i>

06:33.192 --> 06:35.990
- He wants Bones sitting across the table from him.
- Three rational players.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.623
- Me, Booth and Epps.
What about the nondeliberative agent?
- What did she say?

06:39.699 --> 06:42.691
In a game, there tends to be
one "N" rational players...

06:42.769 --> 06:45.260
and a nonconscious,
nondeliberative agent.

06:45.338 --> 06:51.004
What did Epps talk about before he said all
the information you needed was in front of you?

06:51.077 --> 06:55.013
Mom, Bones, blondes, his wrist
being set badly after Bones broke it.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.777
And, um, you know, he...

06:57.850 --> 07:01.377
<i>he made the point that
he really needed his wrist.</i>

07:04.957 --> 07:07.790
Chronic masturbation.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.794
The game may be all about
self-gratification.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.797
The phrase he used was
"right in front of us."

07:12.865 --> 07:15.959
- Yes.
- The blonde is right in front of us.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.970
And she has a wrist.
Well, two, in fact.

07:19.038 --> 07:23.532
- If you had a pet pig, what would you name him?
- Jasper.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.668
- Oh.
- This wrist looks completely normal.

07:25.745 --> 07:29.078
Here.
The right hamate bone.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.582
Hamate?

07:31.651 --> 07:34.245
The whole coloration is off.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.084
It's slightly greasy compared
to the surrounding bone.

07:37.156 --> 07:42.719
It's about an eighth of an inch bigger
than the same bone on the other side.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.821
This hamate bone does not belong
with these remains.

07:45.898 --> 07:48.025
It belongs with a second body.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.898
There's another victim
out there somewhere.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.606
Round one goes to Howard Epps.

07:54.674 --> 07:59.077
- Why?
- Because he gets what he wants.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.113
Me in the room with him.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.048
- Who's that?
- Oh, that is, uh, Caroline Epps.

08:11.123 --> 08:14.251
- Howard's sister?
- Uh, no.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.352
- Howard's wife.
- Well, he didn't have a wife last year.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.454
Well, they got married
about four months ago.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.591
Heads up, Bones. It's our turn
to visit the psychotic murderous maniac...

08:21.667 --> 08:22.895
Bastard.

08:22.969 --> 08:27.030
Hi, Mrs. Epps.
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.040
- This is Dr. Brennan.
- Oh, Agent Booth.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.303
Howard's told me you both
saved his life last year.

08:31.377 --> 08:34.369
- It was our pleasure.
- What? I was disappointed.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.245
Extending Howard's life
has given him time...

08:37.316 --> 08:41.650
to come to grips with what he's done...
to ask God for forgiveness.

08:41.721 --> 08:44.053
Then we did the right thing
by having his execution stayed.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.648
- Are you on some kind of medication?
- Bones.

08:46.726 --> 08:50.628
Dr. Brennan, I'm not one of those crazy women
who falls in love with death row killers.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.994
Obviously,
that's exactly what you are.

08:53.065 --> 08:56.557
If the prison ever gives you a hard time
in coming to see your husband, give me a call.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.160
- I might be able to help.
- Thank you, Agent Booth.

08:58.237 --> 09:00.398
- Are you serious? She's crazy.
- Chop-chop. Let's go.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.169
- Thank you. Nice to see you.
- Nice to meet you both.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.143
- Why were you nice to her?
- Because we might need her.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.238
Ah. Dr. Brennan.
You came.

09:09.315 --> 09:14.309
I got your message.
We're analyzing the wrist bone right now.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.185
We just met your wife.

09:17.256 --> 09:20.316
- She seems very nice.
- Caroline's a hairdresser.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.327
<i>[Door Buzzing]</i>

09:22.395 --> 09:24.659
I'm glad you came.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.164
I hope you come back
after you analyze the bone.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.667
Caroline's the best
I could do in here.

09:29.735 --> 09:34.104
Yeah, not your usual type, Howie.
I mean, not young, not blonde.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.164
- Not dead.
- Bones, could you please shut up?

09:36.242 --> 09:39.268
- Excuse me?
- Is this why you duct-tape their mouths?

09:39.345 --> 09:42.109
<i>Because that I understand.</i>

09:45.084 --> 09:48.679
That's the lamest attempt
at bonding I have ever seen.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.622
[Sniffing]
You smell that?

09:55.695 --> 09:57.856
What?
My stinky effort to bond?

09:57.930 --> 10:01.058
Antiseptic.
My mother smelled like that.

10:01.133 --> 10:04.796
Obsessed with germs.
She washed her hands with ammonia.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.236
Mine too.

10:07.306 --> 10:10.969
My one regret...
I didn't make her my first victim.

10:11.043 --> 10:14.672
- Put her under a little stone cross years ago.
- Okay.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.808
- "Okay" what?
- Okay.

10:18.884 --> 10:22.877
<i>- Okay.
- [Door Opens]</i>

10:23.255 --> 10:27.749
<i>Don't be mad at me, Bones.
My telling you to shut up was a ploy.</i>

10:27.827 --> 10:31.024
- Now he thinks you're an idiot.
- Game theory, Bones, okay?

10:31.097 --> 10:34.191
For two players to gain
advantage over the one...

10:34.266 --> 10:36.200
they must be distinct
from each other.

10:36.268 --> 10:39.669
<i>- Where'd you get that?
- From me. I suggested that you be the smart one.</i>

10:39.739 --> 10:44.335
<i>Which, you know, left me making
a ploy that was supposed to be lame.</i>

10:44.410 --> 10:47.004
- Don't enjoy this.
- What?

10:47.079 --> 10:51.539
<i>The only reason I am playing his game is
to discover the identity of this young woman.</i>

10:51.617 --> 10:53.847
<i>Well, we've made
no progress on that.</i>

10:53.919 --> 10:56.444
Check the junior golf leagues.

10:56.522 --> 10:59.320
Given the amount of wear
to her shoulder, elbow and spine...

10:59.392 --> 11:02.122
she must've started golfing
at an early age.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.755
I found minute traces of gypsum
and selenium on the mystery wrist bone.

11:05.831 --> 11:09.392
<i>Also, phenolphthalein,
which is a kind oflaxative.</i>

11:09.468 --> 11:11.459
Laxatives show up in bones?

11:11.537 --> 11:14.028
No, not even after years of ingestion.

11:14.106 --> 11:17.439
The laxative is on the surface of the bone.
l-I have no explanation.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.776
We have scoured every inch of her,
X-rayed her, run her through an M.R.I.

11:21.847 --> 11:25.943
- What clue are we missing?
- The laxative is the one thing that makes no sense.

11:26.018 --> 11:30.148
<i>Last time, it was masturbation.
Did he reference bowel movements?</i>

11:30.222 --> 11:32.315
He mentioned his mother
was a germophobe...

11:32.391 --> 11:35.656
scrubbing his hands
with ammonia...

11:35.728 --> 11:39.630
- Ammonia.
- Ammonia. Oh! Why didn't you say so?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.724
Ammonia?

11:44.036 --> 11:46.732
Booth thinks we should get together
and buy Brennan a pet.

11:46.806 --> 11:48.797
- What kind of a pet?
- A pig.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.308
And I don't think he means a guinea pig.
A real pig.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.641
Like a Mulefoot, Saddleback,
or pot belly.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.547
<i>You wanna expose a piece of
crucial evidence to ammonia gas? No.</i>

11:57.616 --> 12:01.575
Besides being a laxative,
phenolphthalein is a sensitive pH indicator.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.588
Colorless unless
it's exposed to ammonia.

12:03.656 --> 12:07.114
The second you expose this bone, it's useless.
Epps wants you to destroy evidence.

12:07.193 --> 12:09.354
Why would he want us
to destroy evidence he planted?

12:09.428 --> 12:11.123
Why would he plant
evidence at all?

12:11.197 --> 12:14.257
It might be a win-win
scenario for him.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.995
<i>lfhis endgame is to disorient
Dr. Brennan, he can do that...</i>

12:17.069 --> 12:19.264
by ruining evidence
that he himself planted.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.829
Fine.
You can perform the experiment.

12:21.907 --> 12:25.365
So, glasses.

12:38.824 --> 12:42.191
<i>- [Saroyan] What is that?
- Not sure.</i>

12:50.569 --> 12:53.003
A Freemason symbol?

12:53.072 --> 12:56.803
Hey, this explains
the "buried facedown" thing.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.707
Oh, it's all starting
to come together.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.771
<i>These crossed hammers prove that Epps is
working for the top level of the Illuminati.</i>

13:02.848 --> 13:04.839
That's the cartographic symbol
for a mine.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.686
Oh.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.746
Epps is telling us that the second victim's
in a mine? What kind of mine?

13:11.824 --> 13:14.816
One that contains
gypsum and selenium.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.692
<i>[Brennan]
In prison, Epps mentioned a stone cross.</i>

13:19.765 --> 13:22.700
<i>That's what we should
be looking for inside.</i>

13:22.768 --> 13:26.260
Okay. This is the only
abandoned gypsum mine...

13:26.338 --> 13:29.171
within Epps's known killing ground
to also contain selenium.

13:29.241 --> 13:32.540
Six entrances, hundreds of shafts,
and half of it's flooded.

13:32.611 --> 13:36.707
All right. You just follow my lead and
watch yourself in there, okay? Thank you.

13:36.782 --> 13:39.012
I don't think Epps would
make it that hard for us.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.917
Yeah, well, Epps said he wished
he'd buried his mother under a stone cross.

13:41.987 --> 13:45.514
<i>I bet that is a hint.
Okay, people, listen up!</i>

13:45.591 --> 13:48.025
- I'm calling in a "splunking" team.
- Spelunking.

13:48.093 --> 13:51.893
Spelunking team with imaging capabilities
to look for a stone cross.

13:51.964 --> 13:55.491
Until they get here,
let's focus on the ventilation shafts...

13:55.568 --> 13:57.695
Hold on...
to the west of the main shafts...

13:57.770 --> 14:01.797
What? Oh.
Never mind.

14:04.143 --> 14:07.510
Can we get some light
down this shaft, please?

14:07.580 --> 14:11.607
<i>- It's the cross, Booth.
- That is, uh, definitely a cross.</i>

14:11.684 --> 14:13.618
- Will you help me move these?
- Move what?

14:13.686 --> 14:17.383
- The rocks.
- [Grunts]

14:22.261 --> 14:24.456
Bones! Oh!

14:24.530 --> 14:27.260
<i>Oh!
[Sighs]</i>

14:27.333 --> 14:30.166
Well, it's definitely human, but...

14:30.236 --> 14:32.397
- What?
- Well, Cam can be more precise...

14:32.471 --> 14:34.701
but I don't think
this is more than a week old.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.003
Epps has been in prison
for seven years...

14:37.076 --> 14:40.568
<i>which means he has an accomplice
killing people...</i>

14:40.646 --> 14:43.706
on the outside.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.273
God, I wonder
how many more there are.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.922
This is where
the hamate bone was taken.

14:53.993 --> 14:57.087
The victim is female, mid-teens.

14:57.162 --> 15:00.097
Extensive contusions
around the ankles.

15:00.165 --> 15:03.362
Yes, and bone damage too.

15:03.435 --> 15:07.565
<i>Hip displacement,
elongation of the spine.</i>

15:09.541 --> 15:11.475
[Screams]

15:11.543 --> 15:14.011
<i>- He hung her upside down.
- I agree.</i>

15:14.079 --> 15:17.776
And while she was still alive too.
Is that part of Epps's M. O?

15:17.850 --> 15:21.616
- No.
- So his accomplice threw in some flair of his own.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.212
Nine years ago,
Epps killed someone and buries her.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.349
He goes to jail seven years ago.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.859
Last week,
his accomplice kills another girl...

15:28.928 --> 15:32.989
<i>and swapped wrist bones with
the girl Epps buried nine years ago.</i>

15:33.065 --> 15:35.397
<i>[Brennan]
How do they communicate?</i>

15:35.467 --> 15:39.563
<i>Inmates are allowed phone calls,
visitors, letters.</i>

15:39.638 --> 15:41.299
<i>- But those are all monitored.
- He has a wife.</i>

15:41.373 --> 15:45.173
Look at this. It's a burn.
Cigarette, probably.

15:45.244 --> 15:48.145
<i>And there's this.</i>

15:49.415 --> 15:51.349
It was jammed in her shoe.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.544
What? She wasn't wearing it?

15:56.422 --> 15:58.549
The, uh, mine victim's dental work...

15:58.624 --> 16:02.583
<i>identifies her as Sarah Koskoff,
Bethesda, Maryland.</i>

16:02.661 --> 16:04.856
<i>Disappeared three weeks ago.</i>

16:04.930 --> 16:07.831
<i>- Sixteen years old.
- Sarah Koskoff.</i>

16:07.900 --> 16:11.529
<i>She fits Epps's victim profile perfectly.</i>

16:13.639 --> 16:16.665
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

16:16.742 --> 16:19.939
- Brennan.
- [Booth] Yeah, Bones, it's me.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.946
Listen, I talked to
Sarah Koskoff's parents.

16:22.014 --> 16:26.075
They said her dream was to own her own beauty
shop. She worked for a hair salon in the city.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.915
- Don't tell me.
- Yep. "M" Salon, Cleveland Park.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.617
- Owned by Caroline Mapother.
- Now known as Caroline Epps.

16:32.691 --> 16:36.889
You know, you remember when I was
nice to her and you weren't? This is why.

16:36.962 --> 16:38.953
Thank you.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.430
<i>Hi.</i>

16:43.502 --> 16:46.300
Hi.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.840
- Is-Is Howard okay?
- Howard's fine, Mrs. Epps.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.841
You don't have
to worry about anything.

16:50.909 --> 16:53.605
I couldn't help but notice
the "Help Wanted" sign in the window.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.772
<i>Did you recently lose
one of your employees?</i>

16:55.848 --> 17:01.445
It's, uh, hard to keep help
that doesn't steal from you.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.047
Sarah Koskoff steal from you?

17:05.124 --> 17:08.992
No. Why?
What did she do?

17:09.060 --> 17:11.051
She died.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.631
You know, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask you...

17:15.701 --> 17:18.464
but when was the last time
you saw her?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.028
Uh, three weeks ago.

17:21.106 --> 17:24.473
She just stopped coming to work.
She... She died?

17:24.542 --> 17:28.639
Did you ever, uh, talk
to Howard about her?

17:28.714 --> 17:32.275
- Uh, I don't know. Maybe.
- Howard ever see a picture of Sarah?

17:32.351 --> 17:35.184
l-I don't like this.
What's going on?

17:35.254 --> 17:39.691
She was found buried facedown
in an abandoned mine.

17:39.758 --> 17:44.661
Back of her head bashed in,
wrists, ankles tied.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.198
Your husband's M.O.

17:48.734 --> 17:53.694
Poor Sarah.
But Howard...

17:55.174 --> 17:58.610
Howard has been in prison
for the last seven years.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.975
How could he kill anyone?

18:01.046 --> 18:03.207
He has an accomplice.

18:03.282 --> 18:06.877
- You think it's me?
- You love your husband.

18:06.952 --> 18:10.149
I love the good in Howard.

18:10.222 --> 18:14.886
I reject the evil.
We're going to have a child together.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.793
I've petitioned the court
to let Howard donate.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.728
Yeah.
[Clears Throat]

18:19.798 --> 18:23.734
I have a search warrant here
for your home and your shop.

18:23.802 --> 18:25.861
You don't need a search warrant.

18:25.938 --> 18:31.399
You can look anywhere you want,
because you won't find anything.

18:35.147 --> 18:39.083
<i>[Booth] Sarah Koskoff was hung
upside down before she was killed.</i>

18:39.151 --> 18:41.381
That suggests the torture route.

18:41.453 --> 18:46.516
And I was hoping it was in
the basement of a beauty salon.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.152
<i>But, uh, my agents,
they didn't find anything.</i>

18:49.228 --> 18:52.026
- What's that?
- Religious medal.

18:52.097 --> 18:55.863
- Sarah had it in her possession.
- Saint Agnes.

18:55.934 --> 18:59.927
Patron saint of young women...

19:00.005 --> 19:01.870
especially those
who remain pure.

19:01.940 --> 19:04.033
How do you know all that?

19:04.109 --> 19:06.202
I'm Catholic, Bones.

19:07.679 --> 19:10.842
- "S.A.H.S."
- Yeah, St. Agnes High School.

19:12.951 --> 19:17.854
Except I think Sarah Koskoff
went to public school. Oh, God.

19:17.923 --> 19:20.084
What?
What does that mean?

19:20.159 --> 19:23.526
It means I have to go talk to a nun.

19:23.595 --> 19:27.497
<i>We have no student at St. Agnes
named Sarah Koskoff.</i>

19:27.566 --> 19:30.296
Maybe she's a friend
of one of your girls.

19:30.369 --> 19:33.361
As soon as you called me last night...

19:33.438 --> 19:37.465
we implemented a telephone tree
asking precisely that question.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.943
- No response.
- Do the names Howard Epps...

19:40.012 --> 19:42.947
Caroline Epps, Caroline Mapother
mean anything to you?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.575
May I have the keyboard?

19:45.651 --> 19:48.950
Yes, Sister. Yeah, of course. Here.
[Chuckles]

19:50.889 --> 19:53.619
I need to enter a password.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.388
Oh, yeah.
I'll be right over here.

19:56.461 --> 19:58.258
I'm Catholic.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.992
l-I go to mass every Sunday.

20:01.066 --> 20:05.298
Well, almost every Sunday.
I'm very trustworthy.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.998
<i>Nobody by any of those names.</i>

20:08.073 --> 20:11.600
I feel that I have been very patient...

20:11.677 --> 20:15.511
in regard
to not asking what this is about.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.482
Oh, yeah.
Murder victim.

20:18.550 --> 20:23.010
Ayoung girl was found
with this religious medal.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.423
Helen Majors.

20:30.495 --> 20:33.157
Helen Majors?
Who's that?

20:33.232 --> 20:35.792
This golden medal...

20:35.867 --> 20:38.700
is given to the Holy Spirit Award winner
every year.

20:38.770 --> 20:42.763
<i>I presented this medal
to Helen Majors myself.</i>

20:42.841 --> 20:47.039
May we please see Helen Majors?
Talk to her?

20:47.112 --> 20:51.879
<i>Helen left school three days ago.
No one has seen her since.</i>

20:54.253 --> 20:56.687
Three days ago,
Helen had that medal.

20:56.755 --> 21:00.054
Yesterday, we found it with
Sarah Koskoff's dead body.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.990
It's possible Helen is still alive.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.960
<i>- We have Caroline Epps under surveillance.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

21:04.029 --> 21:06.054
- I hate this.
- All right.

21:06.131 --> 21:11.125
- Booth.
- I don't want to find that girl's
remains in some mine, Booth.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.569
Reiner Hatin?
Address.

21:13.639 --> 21:17.166
7408 Haskell Street, Cleveland Park.

21:17.242 --> 21:19.836
Uh, 22705 to Control.

21:19.911 --> 21:23.540
I'm en route to possible
H.R.T. incident at 7408 Haskell Street.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.482
<i>- Requesting backup.
- [Man On Radio] Affirmative, 22705.</i>

21:26.551 --> 21:28.576
<i>- 7408 Haskell.
- What?</i>

21:28.654 --> 21:31.452
Epps's prison letters log
show in the last year...

21:31.523 --> 21:34.981
he wrote six letters to a man by the name
of Reiner Hatin at that address.

21:35.060 --> 21:38.052
Caroline Epps might not be
Epps's accomplice after all.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.928
- What are you doing?
- Where's the siren on this thing?

21:40.999 --> 21:43.490
<i>- Don't touch...
- [Siren Wailing]</i>

21:49.741 --> 21:51.868
- Okay, Bones, I'm going in.
You're gonna wait outside.
- Booth...

21:51.943 --> 21:55.902
No, I don't wanna hear it. When backup arrives,
tell 'em there's a federal agent inside.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.142
- Which one is it?
- [Clears Throat]

21:58.216 --> 22:03.552
<i>- [Sirens Wailing]
- Great. A vacant lot.</i>

22:03.622 --> 22:05.749
I tried to tell you.

22:10.796 --> 22:13.287
<i>[Door Buzzing]</i>

22:13.365 --> 22:16.391
Did you hear?
I'm gonna be a father.

22:16.468 --> 22:19.266
The judge granted our petition
for artificial insemination.

22:21.139 --> 22:26.202
When I make my donation to the baby bank,
I'm gonna be thinking about you.

22:26.278 --> 22:30.510
- Who's Reiner Hatin?
- Oh, Reiner.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.914
[Speaking German]

22:32.984 --> 22:35.248
<i>The letters were addressed
to a vacant lot.</i>

22:35.320 --> 22:39.654
<i>I must've written the address down wrong.
I'm slightly dyslexic, you know.</i>

22:39.725 --> 22:44.662
Hey, come here. You know,
I really enjoyed playing your game.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.221
Now, you know what?
There is a girl out there...

22:47.299 --> 22:49.631
hanging upside down
with duct tape over her mouth!

22:49.701 --> 22:53.933
<i>Booth, let him go.
Let him go!</i>

22:57.743 --> 23:01.304
For all your faults, Mr. Epps...

23:01.380 --> 23:04.349
you were never interested
in letting your victims suffer.

23:04.416 --> 23:07.852
You didn't torture them.
You're not that kind of man.

23:09.654 --> 23:12.919
She's an innocent child.

23:12.991 --> 23:15.789
She's a young woman...

23:15.861 --> 23:19.524
and there's no such thing
as an innocent woman.

23:20.732 --> 23:24.463
Look within yourself.
You know I'm right.

23:24.536 --> 23:28.063
You know, I'm just guessing here,
you understand, but I think you'll find that...

23:28.140 --> 23:31.507
Helen Majors has less
than 24 hours to live.

23:34.980 --> 23:38.006
Better get going.

23:43.455 --> 23:45.446
Sorry.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.288
[Laughing]

23:55.667 --> 23:59.296
- What are you asking me for?
- You said you've dealt with
manipulative men before.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.805
Sweetie, this is a psycho killer...

24:01.873 --> 24:05.673
not some loser who wants you
to cosign a loan for his Jet Ski.

24:05.744 --> 24:10.545
Epps is pushing me around, Ange.
He's in control. I hate that.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.448
<i>You know...</i>

24:13.518 --> 24:16.009
Epps is acting
kind of like a boyfriend.

24:16.087 --> 24:18.317
[Chuckles]
What?

24:18.390 --> 24:21.154
Well, you obviously fascinate him.

24:21.226 --> 24:24.195
He can't have you,
and he can't kill you.

24:24.262 --> 24:27.663
- So he wants to make you hate yourself.
- God, Ange.

24:27.732 --> 24:29.996
What kind of boyfriends
have you had?

24:30.068 --> 24:32.866
Let's keep the focus
on you and Epps, okay?

24:32.938 --> 24:34.769
Okay.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.365
Epps knows that you'll
never forgive yourself...

24:37.442 --> 24:39.603
<i>if you don't find Helen Majors
before she's murdered.</i>

24:39.678 --> 24:45.378
Not only is Helen being tortured,
but her family must be in agony.

24:45.450 --> 24:49.409
You see?
This is what he's doing.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.422
He's putting pictures
in your mind.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.981
He's messing with
your objectivity.

24:54.059 --> 24:56.357
There's nothing
I can do about that.

24:56.428 --> 25:01.422
You have to step back, okay?
Let the rest of us deal with the families.

25:01.500 --> 25:06.733
You find Helen. That'll keep Epps
from getting a Jet Ski outta you.

25:11.576 --> 25:14.044
Bones. Caroline Epps...
not an accomplice.

25:14.112 --> 25:19.550
- She was at work when
Helen Majors was kidnapped.
- [Speaking German]

25:19.618 --> 25:24.885
- Yeah, whatever.
- It means " old friend with
similar tastes" in German.

25:24.956 --> 25:27.015
Oh, no. Epps telling us
the name of his accomplice?

25:27.092 --> 25:30.391
- That's too easy.
- Well, if it's too easy, then why can't we find him?

25:30.462 --> 25:33.397
You know what?
He talked about impregnating Caroline.

25:33.465 --> 25:38.266
What is with Caroline Epps? I mean,
why have a child with a monster like him?

25:38.336 --> 25:41.863
What is she gonna tell the child when it
grows up? "Hi. Your daddy's a monster."

25:41.940 --> 25:44.340
Look. Time out.
You gotta detach from this, all right?

25:44.409 --> 25:47.435
- We let Epps get under our skin,
it's exactly what he wants.
- Zack was right.

25:47.512 --> 25:52.040
Epps is trying to break us. Not only
did we save his life, but he is still killing.

25:52.117 --> 25:54.051
I found traces of ethylene oxide...

25:54.119 --> 25:56.644
and high levels of an antibacterial agent
on Sarah's ankles.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.884
Also, polymer residue found in
Polygenex latex glove liners...

25:59.958 --> 26:01.983
used by people who handle
toxic substances.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.153
- Airport screeners, cops...
- Wait. Prison guards?

26:04.229 --> 26:07.494
Lauren Hathaway was a nationally ranked
junior golfer in 1997.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.591
<i>Yeah, it's Booth.
I need to know if Howard Epps...</i>

26:09.668 --> 26:12.102
ever had a prison guard
by the name of Reiner Hatin.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.797
She disappeared on May 9...

26:13.872 --> 26:17.103
<i>after leaving the Southampton Country Club
in Raleigh, North Carolina.</i>

26:17.175 --> 26:20.008
Check and see if
any guard changed his name.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.343
"Reiner" is German for "pure."
Epps has a thing about that.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.680
Translate the name and see if that comes back
in any form. Then get back to me.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.811
- This the victim from the park?
- Her father is in your office.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.856
- What?
- Why didn't you say that?

26:31.923 --> 26:35.723
- You were on the phone.
- Booth.

26:35.794 --> 26:38.319
I can't do this one.

26:38.396 --> 26:40.660
Maybe Angela can help.

26:42.233 --> 26:44.667
All right.
I'll take care of it.

26:48.540 --> 26:51.941
My wife died five years
after Lauren disappeared.

26:52.010 --> 26:56.845
I think because
she just gave up hope.

26:56.915 --> 27:00.544
Part of me is glad
she's not here today for this.

27:00.619 --> 27:05.181
We're sorry for your loss, Mr. Hathaway.
For both your losses.

27:05.256 --> 27:08.748
<i>When Lauren disappeared, the police
originally suspected her golf coach.</i>

27:08.827 --> 27:12.820
Yes. He'd had an affair with
one of his students the year before.

27:12.897 --> 27:15.764
Ironically, his alibi was that
he was with another student.

27:15.834 --> 27:20.430
- Does the name Reiner Hatin
mean anything to you?
- No.

27:20.505 --> 27:22.496
Do you recognize this man?

27:26.044 --> 27:29.741
No.
I'm not helping, am I?

27:29.814 --> 27:32.942
That photograph is current.
Here are some drawings that show...

27:33.018 --> 27:36.010
what he might've looked like
10 years ago.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.085
Mmm.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.263
Yes. That one.

27:46.331 --> 27:51.598
He was a greenskeeper at the club.
He helped us load the car one day.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.299
I remember because he told Lauren she looked
just like his mother when she was young.

27:55.373 --> 27:57.773
It was an odd thing to say.

27:57.842 --> 28:01.869
I told the police about it when she
disappeared. Why didn't they arrest him?

28:08.019 --> 28:10.180
<i>Caroline Epps.
She knows something.</i>

28:10.255 --> 28:12.348
- She just won't talk to me.
- Why?

28:12.424 --> 28:15.723
- I'm a man last time I checked.
- But she'll talk to a woman?

28:15.794 --> 28:17.785
- That's my thinking.
- Fine. I'll do it.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.626
Oh, no. You can't sarcasm it out of her.
You have to connect.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.361
- You don't wanna send Brennan?
- No. Angela.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.165
Angela's an artist,
an expert in 3-D reconstruction.

28:26.237 --> 28:30.230
- Well, unlike you and Bones, Angela is, uh...
- What?

28:30.308 --> 28:32.242
She's better with the living
than she is the dead.

28:32.310 --> 28:36.440
- Fine. I'll go tell her
what she's just volunteered for.
- Thank you.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.885
Thanks for coming.

28:41.953 --> 28:46.652
I've told your people everything I know.
I don't see the point of this.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.593
I know this is disturbing.
lfind it very upsetting...

28:50.662 --> 28:53.529
and I'm not married
to the man who did it.

28:53.598 --> 28:56.123
I love Howard,
Miss Montenegro.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.135
I believe you.

28:58.203 --> 29:01.263
No one's ever said that to me.

29:01.339 --> 29:05.639
I think you'd have to love him very much
to be willing to overlook what he's done.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.337
Done in the past.

29:07.412 --> 29:13.282
The thing is, we're not so sure
that it was in the past.

29:13.351 --> 29:17.845
<i>For Howard,
it's obvious what he likes.</i>

29:17.922 --> 29:21.449
- Blonde girls.
- Not me, you mean.

29:21.526 --> 29:25.826
Men can't hide what they like.
For Howard, it's this.

29:25.897 --> 29:28.730
Men can change
what they look at.

29:28.800 --> 29:33.897
Does Howard ever just look at you as though
you just feel his eyes adoring you?

29:37.008 --> 29:38.942
He...

29:39.010 --> 29:43.379
He asks for magazines, DVDs.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.542
He's... He's very specific.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.382
He likes blonde girls.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.912
[Chuckles]
Always the blonde girls.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.852
M-Maybe if I...
if I dyed my hair...

30:00.665 --> 30:03.498
I'm sorry.
I have to ask you something.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.730
Have you ever delivered
any messages for Howard?

30:07.806 --> 30:11.765
- Don't you miss them?
- I'm sorry?

30:13.311 --> 30:17.042
I wrote the message
"Don't you miss them?"...

30:17.115 --> 30:20.607
on a... on a... on a piece of paper
and slipped it into a mailbox.

30:20.685 --> 30:23.119
Whose mailbox?

30:23.188 --> 30:28.353
Um, a man named Henry Gerber
who Howard knew from prison.

30:28.426 --> 30:32.692
<i>Howard calls Henry "The Mad German."</i>

30:32.764 --> 30:35.289
When did you deliver the message?

30:36.401 --> 30:38.801
F... Five days ago.

30:38.870 --> 30:41.862
Thank you.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.567
Can... Can...

30:43.641 --> 30:48.044
<i>Will you sit with me
just a moment longer?</i>

30:48.112 --> 30:52.811
I'm... I have to make a phone call.
You understand?

30:52.884 --> 30:57.787
But after that,
I'll sit with you as long as you like.

31:07.665 --> 31:11.157
<i>- F.B.I. Hands in the air. That's it.
- [Woman Moaning On TV]</i>

31:11.236 --> 31:15.332
Now move over there slowly.
Ah! Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

31:15.406 --> 31:17.738
- I can't do both.
- Booth.

31:19.010 --> 31:22.776
<i>Easy.</i>

31:22.847 --> 31:25.680
<i>[Moaning On TVContinues]</i>

31:25.750 --> 31:29.151
- Where's Henry Gerber?
- I'm Henry Gerber.

31:36.027 --> 31:40.794
There is no way a man in a wheelchair
could have killed Sarah Koskoff...

31:40.865 --> 31:44.665
or swapped hamate bones
with Lauren Hathaway.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.500
All right, Epps got us again, huh?
Gerber's paralyzed from the waist down...

31:47.572 --> 31:51.633
because Epps knifed him
just before he was paroled.

31:51.709 --> 31:55.543
<i>So, what? His message
"Don't you miss them?" meant what, his legs?</i>

31:55.613 --> 31:59.105
Epps is good.
Not morally, of course.

31:59.183 --> 32:03.483
But it's a classic feint-and-parry misdirect
delivered via his wife.

32:03.554 --> 32:06.284
He gets off on screwing
with people's lives.

32:06.357 --> 32:08.382
- Where are we on Reiner Hatin?
- Nowhere.

32:08.459 --> 32:12.793
I had some thoughts. Perhaps the point
isn't that German is a different language...

32:12.864 --> 32:14.798
but that it's actually
a different language.

32:14.866 --> 32:18.063
- Great. Thanks, Zack, for being so helpful.
- Go on.

32:18.136 --> 32:23.699
More broadly speaking, I mean, like
an anagram or an inner or secret language.

32:23.775 --> 32:27.176
<i>These are phrases I found in English.
Perhaps in German...</i>

32:27.245 --> 32:29.645
No, the whole German thing was a ruse.
If it's anywhere, it's here.

32:29.714 --> 32:33.343
<i>"Rant Herein I."
You know, like inner schizophrenic voices.</i>

32:33.418 --> 32:35.477
<i>"A re Inner Hit" could mean...</i>

32:35.553 --> 32:38.420
I don't really do
the poetry thing.

32:38.489 --> 32:42.823
"Neither Rain." No.
"Neither rain nor sleet nor dead of night."

32:42.894 --> 32:46.728
- The postal service motto.
- Hey, the guy's all about sending messages.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.595
Mail to an empty lot.
Messages dropped in mail slots.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.100
Postal workers wear
Polygenex gloves.

32:51.169 --> 32:57.039
Who received the letters
Epps sent to that empty lot?

32:57.108 --> 33:00.509
[Man] Letters with an invalid address and
no return address go to the dead letter office.

33:00.578 --> 33:04.275
<i>- Who has access?
- Uh, sorting staff and the
mail carrier for that route.</i>

33:04.349 --> 33:09.252
Stream us a route which includes
7408 Haskell Street, Cleveland Park, right?

33:09.320 --> 33:12.847
<i>Yes. But there is no
7408 Haskell Street.</i>

33:12.924 --> 33:14.915
Got it.

33:14.993 --> 33:19.293
<i>Hey, that's Caroline Epps's beauty salon.</i>

33:19.364 --> 33:21.855
That's St. Agnes High School.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.992
The killer picked his victims
from a postal route.

33:24.068 --> 33:27.231
<i>- Tell us the name of the mail carrier.
- I can do better than that.</i>

33:27.305 --> 33:31.469
<i>All I ask is that when this goes to the press,
nobody uses the word "disgruntled."</i>

33:31.542 --> 33:34.773
<i>I'm so sorry.
He's never done anything like this.</i>

33:34.846 --> 33:36.780
- Booth.
- Yeah, I got him.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.716
- What?
- That's the guy who found the first body.

33:40.785 --> 33:44.744
Found it because he knew
where it was buried. Let's go.

33:44.822 --> 33:46.949
<i>- [Barking]
- Oh!</i>

33:47.025 --> 33:49.289
<i>Whoa.</i>

33:49.360 --> 33:51.555
Oh, great. Him again.
I'll need a pinecone.

33:51.629 --> 33:55.087
Listen, dog, I will shoot you in the head
if you don't cut it out right now!

33:55.166 --> 33:58.260
[Whines]

33:58.336 --> 33:59.963
Oh.

34:05.276 --> 34:07.938
- Oh.
- God.

34:09.213 --> 34:12.045
I hate the serial killer
wall of death.

34:13.518 --> 34:16.418
This is Sarah Koskoff.

34:16.487 --> 34:21.652
<i>- Helen Majors.
- They were so young, so innocent.</i>

34:22.693 --> 34:24.284
And Lauren Hathaway.

34:24.862 --> 34:28.764
<i>Southampton Country Club.
That's where Epps and his accomplice met.</i>

34:28.833 --> 34:30.766
<i>- Lappin maintained the golf carts.
- [Cell Phone Dialing]</i>

34:30.835 --> 34:34.168
He's winning, Bones. All right?
We're this close to saving Helen Majors's life.

34:34.237 --> 34:36.172
<i>- We're running out of time.
- [Hodgins On Phone] Yeah?</i>

34:36.239 --> 34:39.835
Hodgins, it's me. Is there anything you can
tell us about where Sarah Koskoff was held...

34:39.911 --> 34:42.175
before her body was
dumped in the gypsum mine?

34:42.246 --> 34:46.512
The only substance I can't explain
is ethylene oxide.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.678
What about the ethylene oxide
plus the antibacterial agents?

34:49.754 --> 34:52.222
It could be a lot of things.

34:52.290 --> 34:55.384
<i>I'll set up a statistical model,
give you four or five scenarios.</i>

34:55.460 --> 34:58.122
There is no time.
A girl's life is at stake here.

34:58.196 --> 35:00.960
<i>Just give me
your best guess right now.</i>

35:01.032 --> 35:03.523
I can't just guess!
I have a process!

35:05.069 --> 35:07.503
<i>What if I guess and the girl dies?</i>

35:07.572 --> 35:11.565
<i>- No. No way!
- All right. Just simmer down, Hodgins.</i>

35:11.642 --> 35:14.304
<i>We're all just trying to do our best
in this situation right now.</i>

35:14.378 --> 35:17.506
- Jack.
- Hodgins, are you still there?

35:17.582 --> 35:21.518
Hey.
Pretend it's me asking, okay?

35:21.586 --> 35:25.181
Look, we're just exchanging theories here
at work like always.

35:25.256 --> 35:29.124
Two substances, right?
Put them in the same place at the same time.

35:29.193 --> 35:32.321
- Either they mean something or they don't.
- Hodgins, you there, buddy?

35:32.396 --> 35:36.230
- Yeah. Just give me a second, please.
- We don't have a second.

35:36.300 --> 35:40.100
Booth, do you think you could just
stop talking, please?

35:42.473 --> 35:45.567
Okay. All right.
Uh, antibacterial agents.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.838
<i>And, uh, he...
He's a postal worker.</i>

35:47.912 --> 35:49.743
- Okay.
- Uh...

35:49.814 --> 35:52.612
What else, Jack?

35:54.018 --> 35:56.578
- Anthrax.
- Anthrax?

35:56.654 --> 36:01.682
After the anthrax attacks in 2001,
the post office shut down several sorting centers.

36:01.759 --> 36:03.590
Okay.
All right.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.458
<i>Tell me.</i>

36:05.530 --> 36:09.091
Uh, they used ethylene oxide
and this antibacterial agent to...

36:09.167 --> 36:11.727
That's how they cleaned 'em.
Not all of'em reopened.

36:11.802 --> 36:15.135
So it's possible Sarah was kept
at an abandoned sorting center?

36:15.206 --> 36:17.037
Yes.

36:18.376 --> 36:20.071
Yes, it is.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.135
I knew you'd come through for me, buddy.
Good work.

36:43.734 --> 36:46.396
Yeah, well,
just be careful, all right?

36:46.470 --> 36:48.870
Don't shoot me.

38:15.493 --> 38:17.484
God!

38:17.561 --> 38:19.586

Yeah.

38:21.699 --> 38:24.190
I'm glad you did.

- Shot resisting arrest.

38:46.767 --> 38:48.251
Who shot him?

38:51.376 --> 38:52.909
It was you, wasn't it?

38:55.057 --> 38:58.712
You shot him? Did he take long to die?

39:01.155 --> 39:02.481
Did he suffer?

39:04.677 --> 39:07.639
This is better than I hoped.
I thought it would be you.

39:08.817 --> 39:11.699
How did it feel? Dirty, yes?

39:12.207 --> 39:13.671
But there's also a rush.

39:14.996 --> 39:16.292
Pleasure.

39:17.206 --> 39:18.640
Part of you liked it.

39:20.917 --> 39:24.119
This whole game was to
have us kill someone?

39:24.856 --> 39:26.890
Who's going to tell Lappin's mom?

39:27.894 --> 39:29.750
She loves him very much, you know.

39:30.557 --> 39:33.821
Without her son, she'll be
completely alone in this sad world.

39:36.796 --> 39:39.741
We're done with you. You're
never gonna see us again. Come on.

39:42.864 --> 39:45.361
I'm pretty sure you're wrong
about that, Agent Booth.

40:03.497 --> 40:05.141
Vodka?

40:06.695 --> 40:10.930
It's water. But it's... on the rocks.

40:11.745 --> 40:14.832
You know, Bones, I'm not sure
you've grasped the basic theory,

40:14.835 --> 40:16.769
you know, of getting drunk.

40:16.976 --> 40:18.102
Hey.

40:19.365 --> 40:23.029
What you need to do is
order a shot of hard liquor

40:24.237 --> 40:26.669
from a bartender named Shakey

40:26.674 --> 40:30.970
and tell him to leave
the bottle on the bar.

40:31.977 --> 40:34.039
I'm fine, Booth.

40:35.454 --> 40:37.721
I'm sitting here,
thinking about it and...

40:39.096 --> 40:40.472
I'm fine.

40:42.405 --> 40:43.732
Okay.

40:44.637 --> 40:47.819
What I'm getting from you here,
Bones, is that you're fine.

40:53.654 --> 40:55.239
He murdered Sarah.

40:55.247 --> 40:57.212
He was about to murder Helen.

40:57.217 --> 41:01.180
Why should I feel upset
about shooting him?

41:01.186 --> 41:03.860
You know, I mean, if I was
going to be upset, which I'm not,

41:03.865 --> 41:06.600
it would be because Epps
thinks he beat us, so...

41:07.617 --> 41:09.392
- He didn't.
- I know.

41:09.397 --> 41:11.711
You're upset because
you think he beat us.

41:13.444 --> 41:14.960
And you know what?

41:16.446 --> 41:17.839
He did.

41:19.734 --> 41:21.719
- Beat us?
- Yeah.

41:21.725 --> 41:24.911
- You just said that he didn't.
- Well, I changed my mind.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.742
What, in the last three seconds?

41:26.747 --> 41:29.651
You know, you're afraid that
Epps turned you into him,

41:30.286 --> 41:31.949
into a killer.

41:32.257 --> 41:36.451
You have to come to grips with the fact
that you killed another human being.

41:38.286 --> 41:40.321
Because when you kill someone...

41:40.475 --> 41:42.360
You know, there's a cost.

41:44.044 --> 41:45.709
A steep cost.

41:47.427 --> 41:49.531
I know; I've done it.

41:52.047 --> 41:55.539
- I did the right thing.
- I know.

41:59.294 --> 42:00.922
I was there.

42:08.274 --> 42:12.270
- Look what I did.
- It doesn't matter.

42:12.877 --> 42:14.852
It does. It matters.

42:18.715 --> 42:20.482
Got something for you.

42:22.104 --> 42:25.160
- A bottle of hard liquor?
- The next best thing.

42:29.144 --> 42:30.440
Hmm?

42:32.055 --> 42:35.039
Meet... Jasper.

42:47.696 --> 42:49.680
You're going to be okay.

42:51.604 --> 42:54.619
- Yeah?
- Definitely.
