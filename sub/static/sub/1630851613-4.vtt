(Jamie panting)
- Ooh. (laughs)

01:11.919 --> 01:13.857
- Sorry, I overslept.

01:13.957 --> 01:15.956
A bit of a bender last night.

01:16.995 --> 01:18.573
Kat had a speaking
engagement, so.

01:18.673 --> 01:20.772
- And I wanted to say
thank you to my bestie

01:20.872 --> 01:22.970
for helping me, so we
had a few drinky-poos.

01:23.070 --> 01:24.568
- Yes, I can smell all of them.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.407
- Yeah, it did get a
bit Keith Richards.

01:26.507 --> 01:27.966
- Don't look at me.

01:28.066 --> 01:30.324
I wasn't the one who
gate crashed a hen party.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.841
- Gosh, that's strong
for a school night.

01:32.941 --> 01:34.160
(Kat laughs)
- I mean, they needed me.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.519
The maid of honour was
doing her best, but-

01:35.619 --> 01:36.678
- Yeah, she was
no Captain Party.

01:36.778 --> 01:37.877
Go on, do the voice.

01:37.977 --> 01:41.114
- Ah-har, me party hearties.

01:41.214 --> 01:45.710
(both laughing)
(Fran fake-laughing)

01:45.810 --> 01:47.309
- Oh, mm.

01:47.409 --> 01:49.188
- Ah, looks like we
weren't the only one

01:49.288 --> 01:51.286
who had a big night
last night, Franny.

01:52.165 --> 01:53.904
- Didn't leave the house, Katty.

01:54.004 --> 01:55.902
- Seriously? Wow.

01:56.002 --> 01:58.460
So empowered to just not give
a shit what you look like.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.558
Love that.

02:02.037 --> 02:05.893
- Did these scarves come as
a sort of bargain 2 for 1?

02:05.993 --> 02:08.971
- No, this is just another
little thank you from me.

02:09.071 --> 02:12.368
- This is 100% silk,
designer scarf, Fran.

02:12.468 --> 02:14.006
- Mm.

02:14.106 --> 02:16.444
Can you still call it
a scarf if it's so thin

02:16.544 --> 02:17.264
it doesn't actually
keep you warm?

02:17.344 --> 02:18.523
I was just wondering.

02:18.623 --> 02:19.802
- Franny, would you
mind taking a quick snap

02:19.902 --> 02:21.560
of the survivors for us?

02:21.660 --> 02:23.678
- Oh yes.
- Ooh.

02:23.778 --> 02:24.717
- Come on, ready? One, two-

02:24.817 --> 02:27.995
(camera snaps)
There you go.

02:28.095 --> 02:29.353
- Thank you.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.432
- We should probably
go. We're a bit late.

02:31.532 --> 02:33.710
Very important security
training course, you know.

02:33.810 --> 02:37.027
That's proper work, proper,
no drinky-poos there.

02:37.127 --> 02:38.745
- Me too.

02:38.845 --> 02:40.704
I have got a meeting with my
publisher about my new book.

02:40.804 --> 02:42.862
Um, everyone's still buying
the shit out of the old one.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.020
Chill out.
(Fran chuckles)

02:45.120 --> 02:46.539
So this will be the
longest we've been away

02:46.639 --> 02:48.138
from each other in weeks.

02:48.238 --> 02:50.136
Do you really have to go
away for the whole weekend?

02:50.236 --> 02:52.254
- I'm afraid it's just
how long the course lasts.

02:52.354 --> 02:53.093
- I'll miss you.

02:53.193 --> 02:55.192
- I'll miss you, too.

02:55.711 --> 02:58.389
- All right, I'm gonna go,
and I'll be in the van.

03:02.465 --> 03:04.284
- You'll talk to her, yeah,
about what we discussed.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.683
- Yeah, I'll try mighty good.

03:05.783 --> 03:07.841
- Best you do it sooner
rather than later.

03:07.941 --> 03:10.199
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay?

03:10.299 --> 03:12.077
Unless you've changed
your mind, Jamie.

03:12.177 --> 03:13.156
You can be honest with me.

03:13.256 --> 03:14.235
If this isn't what you want...

03:14.335 --> 03:16.713
- No, no, no. No, no.

03:16.813 --> 03:17.872
No, it definitely is.

03:17.972 --> 03:19.951
I'll tell her today, I promise.

03:20.051 --> 03:22.169
- You have so much
courage inside of you

03:23.528 --> 03:25.526
and we're just starting
to unlock it together.

03:33.399 --> 03:36.097
- Oh, Fran, why'd you have to
park all the way over there?

03:36.197 --> 03:37.536
- [Fran] All right,
straight to A&amp;E

03:37.636 --> 03:39.634
or should we do the job first?

03:40.913 --> 03:42.911
- Jamie!

03:43.790 --> 03:45.809
Ah-har.

03:45.909 --> 03:47.907
- Ah-har.

03:48.746 --> 03:50.804
Oh, dear.

03:50.904 --> 03:52.803
- [Fran] Right, milking it now.

03:52.903 --> 03:55.001
- Oh, my head.
(door bangs)

03:55.101 --> 03:57.539
(eerie music)

04:03.454 --> 04:05.152
Sorry about the hangy, mate.

04:05.252 --> 04:06.311
I know it's unprofessional.

04:06.411 --> 04:08.410
- No, it's absolutely
fine, mate.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.867
- Really? I thought
you'd be cross.

04:10.967 --> 04:11.867
- What, me?

04:11.967 --> 04:13.345
I'm super chill, well, you know.

04:13.445 --> 04:15.104
It's an easy job today, anyway.

04:15.204 --> 04:16.782
We'll just have
fun, hanging out,

04:16.882 --> 04:18.621
mates being mates and all that,

04:18.721 --> 04:22.218
just a couple of A-grade
assassins literally slaying.

04:22.318 --> 04:23.696
(Jamie sighs)

04:23.796 --> 04:26.254
Oh, that's an 80%
proof sigh, that one.

04:26.354 --> 04:27.693
You sure you're
okay to do this hit?

04:27.793 --> 04:29.791
- Yeah, yeah, I'm
a professional.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.770
So who are we slaying today?

04:31.870 --> 04:32.769
- Oh, it's easy, this one.

04:32.869 --> 04:34.567
Big crime boss, organ harvester.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.166
- Ugh.

04:36.266 --> 04:38.764
- Can you imagine removing
somebody's eyeballs?

04:38.864 --> 04:40.083
I mean, what would you do?

04:40.183 --> 04:42.121
Would you take them out
with spoon? (popping)

04:42.221 --> 04:44.998
Or would you go for a sort of
sucking technique (slurping)?

04:45.098 --> 04:47.097
Big straw?
- No, Fran, no.

04:47.696 --> 04:48.635
- Oh, what about guts?

04:48.735 --> 04:50.554
Slippery, like a wet rope-

04:50.654 --> 04:52.072
- Okay.
- That goes on forever.

04:52.172 --> 04:53.911
- Okay, you can stop now.
- Liver.

04:54.011 --> 04:55.629
That's not nice, a
couple of kidneys,

04:55.729 --> 04:58.187
pop them out, your giblets.

04:58.287 --> 04:59.906
Do humans have giblets?

05:00.006 --> 05:02.184

05:02.284 --> 05:03.743

freshly raked gravel.

05:36.575 --> 05:39.192
(Jamie vomiting)

05:39.292 --> 05:41.491
You see, this is why I
don't go to hen parties.

05:42.570 --> 05:46.466
Or parties. Or out, ever.

05:46.566 --> 05:47.745
I'm a teetotal killing machine,

05:47.845 --> 05:51.102
like the Terminator
or Saudi Arabia.

05:51.202 --> 05:52.501
- (sigh) I think I
got it all up now.

05:52.601 --> 05:53.820
- Well, listen, give
me a hand with Methven,

05:53.920 --> 05:55.938
we'll take you to a
nice, warm travel lodge,

05:56.038 --> 05:57.817
get a nice watery
Masala down you,

05:57.917 --> 05:59.575
some hair of the dog.

05:59.675 --> 06:01.134
- (vomits) Nothing to get out.

06:01.234 --> 06:02.413
- (chuckles) Do you know what?

06:02.513 --> 06:04.051
I'm really glad that
you and Kat had a chance

06:04.151 --> 06:05.570
to just, you know, hang out
before we leave for Japan.

06:05.670 --> 06:07.329
- Ooh, yeah, definitely.

06:07.429 --> 06:09.487
- Oh, talking of which, Mr.
V's got the flight itineraries

06:09.587 --> 06:11.885
all sorted, so you need
to sort that visa out.

06:11.985 --> 06:13.963
- Yeah, yeah, no,
I will, definitely.

06:14.063 --> 06:15.322
- Good.

06:15.422 --> 06:17.420
Good. All right.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.637
Come on, give me a hand.

06:20.737 --> 06:22.036
Okay.

06:22.136 --> 06:22.855
I don't wanna stay
in here too long.

06:22.935 --> 06:23.635
I'd lose a kidney.

06:23.735 --> 06:24.994
- That'd be awful.

06:25.094 --> 06:27.312
- Oh, she's back in
the room. (chuckles)

06:27.412 --> 06:28.670
Do you know what?

06:28.770 --> 06:29.530
We could never be
organ harvesters.

06:29.610 --> 06:30.469
- Why?
- It takes guts.

06:30.569 --> 06:32.907
- Oh! She's good.

06:33.007 --> 06:34.346
I would applaud, obviously,

06:34.446 --> 06:35.545
but I'm handling a dead body.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.584
- Yeah.

06:36.684 --> 06:37.823
- Now, where we gonna hide him?

06:37.923 --> 06:38.662
- Good question.

go in the ground, isn't it?

the stripper joining us

07:09.456 --> 07:11.454
for karaoke. (laughs)

Mad, right?

07:22.125 --> 07:23.344
- Do you get any work done,

07:23.444 --> 07:25.442
or is it just cock
straws and carnage?

07:26.162 --> 07:27.461
- Yeah, we did work, but
it didn't feel like work,

07:27.561 --> 07:29.619

and son following us?

07:43.147 --> 07:43.967

07:44.067 --> 07:46.445
- So that's and son.

07:46.545 --> 07:47.683
God, he's gonna come
get our kidneys.

07:47.783 --> 07:48.962

07:49.062 --> 07:50.321
It's probably just
a coincidence.

07:50.421 --> 07:52.420
It's just another undertaker.

07:53.179 --> 07:55.597
- Well, okay, let's
just slow down a bit

07:55.697 --> 07:57.555
and see if they overtake.

07:57.655 --> 07:59.673

undertaker is gonna overtake.

Off you piss.

Okay, he's gone, he's gone.

10:12.581 --> 10:13.680

10:13.780 --> 10:14.679

10:53.306 --> 10:54.285
- Should we be going
back to the van?

10:54.385 --> 10:55.844
What if he's still there?

10:55.944 --> 10:57.163
- Well, have you
got a better idea?

10:57.263 --> 10:59.401
We're in the middle of nowhere.

10:59.501 --> 11:00.800
Oh, balls, this is dead.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.398
Can I borrow yours?

11:02.498 --> 11:03.917
- No, just, I've gotta reply
to this before it dies.

11:04.017 --> 11:06.015
- Jamie.

11:08.493 --> 11:09.272
Jamie.

11:09.372 --> 11:11.371
- Yeah, just sending it.

11:12.610 --> 11:14.608
- Jamie.
- Yeah.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.743
(gun cocking)

11:20.843 --> 11:22.301
(birds chirping)

11:22.401 --> 11:25.858
(gravel crunching)

11:25.958 --> 11:27.377
Wait. He's still there.

11:27.477 --> 11:28.536
(tense music)

11:28.636 --> 11:29.695
Oh, shit.

11:29.795 --> 11:31.534
Right, okay.

11:31.634 --> 11:34.072
(tense music)

11:46.341 --> 11:49.798
(birds chirping)

11:49.898 --> 11:50.877
- Where is he?

11:50.977 --> 11:52.556
- I don't know.

11:52.656 --> 11:53.535
Obviously, he's left his
keys, so he can't be far.

11:53.615 --> 11:55.753
He's obviously looking for us.

11:55.853 --> 11:56.872
(birds chirping)

11:56.972 --> 11:58.431
Get in.
- What?

11:58.531 --> 11:59.830
- Get in the hearse, quick.

11:59.930 --> 12:02.368
(upbeat music)

12:03.566 --> 12:04.945
(engine revving)

12:05.045 --> 12:07.523
(upbeat music)

12:12.679 --> 12:15.476
(light rock music)

12:17.754 --> 12:18.933
- You're so good at this, Fran.

12:19.033 --> 12:21.132
I mean, you're really
made for this job.

12:21.232 --> 12:23.330
- Yeah, thanks, mate.

12:23.430 --> 12:24.768
I think we make a good team.

12:24.868 --> 12:26.867
- Mm.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.925
- Can you just not?

12:29.025 --> 12:31.003
I'm gonna confiscate
that, all right?

12:31.103 --> 12:32.642
What could be so
important that she needs

12:32.742 --> 12:34.400
to be in contact with you
every second of the day?

12:34.500 --> 12:37.038
- Well, actually, it
is quite important

12:37.138 --> 12:39.576
because Kat's offered me a job.

12:42.853 --> 12:44.112
- Doing what?

12:44.212 --> 12:47.109
- Well, she wants me to
be her right hand woman.

12:47.209 --> 12:48.428
- Right hand woman?

12:48.528 --> 12:50.147
I mean, that's not
a job title, is it?

12:50.247 --> 12:52.105
That's not something
you can put on a CV.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.904
I mean, right hand woman.

12:54.004 --> 12:55.502
It's not really a
thing, is it, Jamie?

12:55.602 --> 12:57.860
- Well, it is a thing,
and I'm going to take it,

12:57.960 --> 13:00.758
and I'm sorry you feel that way.

13:02.197 --> 13:04.095
- What way?

13:04.195 --> 13:05.174
I'm not sure about the logistics

13:05.274 --> 13:06.493
of this thing, to be honest.

13:06.593 --> 13:08.611
I mean, how is being
Kat's right hand woman

13:08.711 --> 13:09.970
gonna fit with
everything we've got on?

13:10.070 --> 13:11.809
I mean, we've got
Japan and I mean,

13:11.909 --> 13:13.167
you've got a lot of commitments.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.286
- Well, Kat wants me to
start straightaway, so.

13:15.386 --> 13:17.164
- I don't think you've
thought this through.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.383
I mean, unless it's something
you can do remotely,

13:18.463 --> 13:19.682
but the time difference, it's-

13:19.782 --> 13:22.000
- No, Fran, the job
with Kat would be

13:22.100 --> 13:24.318
instead of going
to Japan with you.

13:24.418 --> 13:26.416
(tires squealing)
- Whoa, hold on.

13:27.655 --> 13:28.554
What?

13:28.654 --> 13:30.673
- I'm not coming to Japan.

13:30.773 --> 13:32.311
And I'm sorry you feel that way.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.829
- Will you stop saying, "And
I'm sorry you feel that way"?

13:34.929 --> 13:36.987
It's not even a real apology,
apart from everything else.

13:37.087 --> 13:38.786
- You don't really
need me anyway.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.964
I'm sure Mr. V would
just find a replacement.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.100
- Just a temporary
break, though, eh?

13:45.200 --> 13:47.538
- Kat said I should
follow my bliss.

13:47.638 --> 13:48.817
- Follow your bliss?
- Yes.

13:48.917 --> 13:51.295
- You sound like a
shit scatter cushion.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.173
I'm sorry, Kat's
pushed you into this.

13:53.273 --> 13:55.252
I was gonna hold my
tongue, keep my peace,

13:55.352 --> 13:56.970
but no, she's brainwashing you.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.048
She's a psycho and she's trying
to steal you away from me.

13:59.148 --> 14:01.366
- What are you talking about?

14:01.466 --> 14:02.765
She's actually a
really good friend.

14:02.865 --> 14:04.044
- Something's going on.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.723
I mean, why else
would you let somebody

14:05.823 --> 14:08.121
live in your place rent-free
or make them packed lunches

14:08.221 --> 14:10.239
with wee, little
notes and sayings

14:10.339 --> 14:11.838
and give you pocket money?

14:11.938 --> 14:13.556
- It's not pocket
money. It's expenses.

14:13.656 --> 14:15.914
- No, you are her
golden retriever.

14:16.014 --> 14:17.633
Mm-hmm.

14:17.733 --> 14:18.812
She's made you beholden to
her so that you have to do

14:18.892 --> 14:20.191
everything she wants.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.829
Oh God, why else would
you have got the job?

14:21.929 --> 14:23.867
- Because she likes me,
because I'm useful to her.

14:23.967 --> 14:25.826
I know it's hard
for you to conceive

14:25.926 --> 14:27.344
that I might be
able to do something

14:27.444 --> 14:29.103
that you haven't
instructed me to do.

14:29.203 --> 14:31.621
- I haven't been
instructing you, Jamie.

14:31.721 --> 14:33.719
I've been helping you.

14:34.119 --> 14:35.458
And to be honest,
most of the time,

14:35.558 --> 14:37.136
you're an active hindrance.

14:37.236 --> 14:38.815
- Wow.

14:38.915 --> 14:40.493
Kat said you'd react like that.

14:40.593 --> 14:41.452
- Oh, Kat's poison.

14:41.552 --> 14:43.091
She's just got in your ears.

14:43.191 --> 14:45.209
Just when we finally got to
do what you wanted to do.

14:45.309 --> 14:47.328
- No, what you wanted to do.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.566
Maybe I want
something different.

14:48.666 --> 14:49.885
(eerie music)

14:49.985 --> 14:51.884
Maybe I want to
not do the same job

14:51.984 --> 14:54.162
that I've been doing
for, well, ever.

14:54.262 --> 14:55.521
Maybe I want to explore things.

14:55.621 --> 14:58.238
Maybe I want to
expand my horizons.

14:58.338 --> 15:00.476
- We're going to the Land
of the Rising Sun, Jamie.

15:00.576 --> 15:02.515
How much more
horizons do you want?

15:02.615 --> 15:03.834
(liquid splashing)
We were going up

15:03.934 --> 15:06.231
in the world, we were
literally going far.

15:06.331 --> 15:07.790
Nailing assassinhood.

15:07.890 --> 15:10.228
(Jamie and Fran yelling)

15:10.328 --> 15:14.105
(sheep bleating)
(muffled yelling)

15:14.205 --> 15:17.342
(bird cawing)

15:17.442 --> 15:21.339
(panting) Jamie.

15:21.439 --> 15:22.817
- Is this heaven?
- I think,

15:22.917 --> 15:24.256
traditionally,
heaven's a lot brighter

15:24.356 --> 15:25.815
and less cramped
than this, mate.

15:25.915 --> 15:27.453
- [Jamie] Can I
have my phone back,

15:27.553 --> 15:29.412
or is it still confiscated?
- It's in my back pocket.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.631
Oh, for heaven's sake, no,
that's my front bottom.

15:30.711 --> 15:32.090
That's, yep, oh-
- Oh, yep.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.408
- [Fran] Just a bit
pinchy. Hang on, just-

15:33.508 --> 15:35.507
- Got it. Got it, got it.

15:36.786 --> 15:40.003
Oh, 17 messages.

15:40.103 --> 15:41.681
Well, I hope Kat doesn't
think I'm ignoring her.

15:41.781 --> 15:43.780
- Just forget Kat.
Pass us the phone.

15:48.016 --> 15:50.794
Yep, yeah, okay.

15:50.894 --> 15:54.331
Yep, that's what I expected.

15:55.770 --> 15:56.629
- I think we're in a coffin.

15:56.729 --> 15:57.868
- We're in a coffin, yeah, yeah.

15:57.968 --> 16:00.426
And I'm claustrophobic,
so maybe it'll be

16:00.526 --> 16:02.544
the panic attack for me, please.

16:02.644 --> 16:03.603
- Let's just try and push
that up, right, this-

16:03.683 --> 16:06.201
(Fran yelling)

16:07.799 --> 16:11.936
(shovel clanging)
(phone beeping)

16:12.036 --> 16:13.614
Oh, my phone's just died, too.

16:13.714 --> 16:15.373
- [Fran] If you hadn't spent
the whole time texting Kat,

16:15.473 --> 16:16.692
trying to stab your
best mate in the back,

16:16.792 --> 16:18.290
then we wouldn't
be about to perish.

16:18.390 --> 16:20.389
- Wait, I've got an idea.

16:21.947 --> 16:23.246
Yay.

16:23.346 --> 16:24.925
- Ooh, great.

16:25.025 --> 16:28.841
I can use the cock torch to
check for cracks and gaps.

16:28.941 --> 16:31.659
Mm-hmm, yes.

16:33.098 --> 16:35.036
Yes, we are going to die.

16:35.136 --> 16:36.915
- Okay, you're
not gonna like it,

16:37.015 --> 16:39.992
but I have just farted.

16:40.092 --> 16:42.490
- [Fran] Oh, God, burning my nostrils.

16:44.208 --> 16:47.106
- I'm really sorry, okay, that
you feel so hurt about Japan.

16:47.206 --> 16:50.703
It's just that Kat thinks I
need to really fully realise my-

16:50.803 --> 16:54.060
- I don't, I really don't
wanna die talking about Kat,

16:54.160 --> 16:56.978
thanks, or as it goes,
holding a cock torch.

16:57.078 --> 16:59.635
- Yeah, but I don't want
us to go out on a barmy.

17:02.633 --> 17:04.911
(both yell)

17:05.870 --> 17:07.728
(both grunting)

17:07.828 --> 17:10.566
I'm really sorry for being
actively a hindrance.

17:10.666 --> 17:11.805
- No, I'm sorry.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.484
You're not actively a hindrance.

17:13.584 --> 17:16.081
I just use criticism as a mean
of just emotional expression.

17:16.181 --> 17:18.319
I'm very repressed.

17:18.419 --> 17:19.159
I love you.

17:19.259 --> 17:20.198
- I love you too.

17:20.298 --> 17:21.677
Should we kiss, then?

17:21.777 --> 17:23.395
- What?

17:23.495 --> 17:24.954
- I don't know, I've just
we've never done before.

17:25.054 --> 17:27.152
- Why do you have to
make everything so weird?

17:27.252 --> 17:29.850
(dirt thumping)

17:32.288 --> 17:34.306
- [Jamie] Right, we've
lost the cock torch.

17:34.406 --> 17:35.745
- [Fran] Listen to me, I'm
so sorry I wasn't there

17:35.845 --> 17:37.743
for you when you had
to live in a van.

17:37.843 --> 17:39.342
- [Jamie] It was actually
quite comfortable.

17:39.442 --> 17:41.500
(electronic whirring)

17:41.600 --> 17:43.598
What's he doing?

17:44.238 --> 17:46.615
(engine rumbling)
- What's going on?

17:46.715 --> 17:47.575
- [Jamie] I don't know.

17:47.675 --> 17:48.534
It sounds like he's leaving.

17:48.634 --> 17:49.493
Let's push the lid again.

17:49.593 --> 17:50.932
- [Both] One, two, three.

17:51.032 --> 17:52.371
- What the...

17:52.471 --> 17:54.249
- Where the hell is he?

17:54.349 --> 17:56.347
- Let's not wait to find out.

17:58.825 --> 18:00.404
(gravel crunching)

18:00.504 --> 18:02.162
We need to move.
- Yep.

18:02.262 --> 18:03.801
(gravel crunching)

18:03.901 --> 18:05.899
- Something's not right.

18:08.537 --> 18:10.635
- Wait, is that?

18:10.735 --> 18:13.832
(chuckling) Kat.

18:13.932 --> 18:16.070
- Oh my God.

18:16.170 --> 18:17.669
What the hell are
you doing here?

18:17.769 --> 18:19.767
- We got lost.

18:20.407 --> 18:21.666
What are you doing here?

18:21.766 --> 18:22.905
How did you find us?

18:23.005 --> 18:25.003
- Find My Friends.

18:25.523 --> 18:27.581
I freaked out when you
stopped replying to my texts.

18:27.681 --> 18:28.979
I was so worried.

18:29.079 --> 18:31.657
Sorry, you must think I'm mad.

18:31.757 --> 18:34.775
I know you said the training
course would be intense,

18:34.875 --> 18:38.472
but I just thought you might
be in serious trouble or.

18:40.190 --> 18:41.689
Why are you walking around
in the middle of nowhere?

18:41.789 --> 18:44.047
- Oh, just a really
intensive hardcore

18:44.147 --> 18:46.045
SAS type training course, yes.

18:46.145 --> 18:47.384
You know, dump you in the
middle of the wilderness

18:47.464 --> 18:48.723
and find your way
back to civilization,

18:48.823 --> 18:49.522
that kind of thing.

18:49.622 --> 18:50.761
- Hmm.

18:50.861 --> 18:52.400
- Not really suitable
for civilians.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.097
- (chuckles) Well, I'm
just glad you're okay.

18:56.416 --> 18:58.415
(sighs) I was so worried.

19:00.253 --> 19:01.472
Let's get you out of here.

19:01.572 --> 19:03.570
- Oh.

19:04.569 --> 19:05.908
- Careful.

19:06.008 --> 19:07.827
My car's this way.

19:07.927 --> 19:09.105
You looking for something?

19:09.205 --> 19:11.104
- Oh, yeah, just our teammates.

19:11.204 --> 19:12.463
This was the rendezvous point,

19:12.563 --> 19:14.541
but I think we've
beaten them to it.

19:14.641 --> 19:18.158
You haven't seen a very
long, black car, have you?

19:19.876 --> 19:21.975
- I actually did see a car
screech off when I got here.

19:22.075 --> 19:22.854
Maybe that was them.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.652
- Oh, they pranked us.

19:24.752 --> 19:25.532
Didn't even wait.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.010
Classic them.
- Ah.

19:27.110 --> 19:29.528
(Kat and Jamie laugh)

19:29.628 --> 19:31.626
Ah.

19:32.106 --> 19:35.643
(gravel crunching)

19:35.743 --> 19:37.801
- What?

19:37.901 --> 19:38.900
You don't find this
My Find a Friend thing

19:38.980 --> 19:39.719
a bit odd, do you?

19:39.819 --> 19:40.719
- What do you mean?

19:40.819 --> 19:41.918
- It's creepy.

19:42.018 --> 19:43.556
She's tracking your every move.

19:43.656 --> 19:45.515
- Mate, it's an app.

19:45.615 --> 19:48.252
Privacy's dead, we've all
seen Jeff Bezos' balls.

19:49.891 --> 19:51.889
- I've not seen his balls.

19:53.648 --> 19:57.105
Listen, um, congratulations
on your new colleague.

19:57.205 --> 19:58.424
Jamie told me the exciting news.

19:58.524 --> 19:59.822
- Ah, thanks.

19:59.922 --> 20:02.101
Guess you'll have
to take backseat.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.199
- What?
- In the car.

20:04.838 --> 20:06.837
- Oh, yeah.

20:10.154 --> 20:13.231
(electronic whirring)

20:14.550 --> 20:17.348
(leather creaking)

20:19.106 --> 20:20.685
(door banging)

20:20.785 --> 20:22.004
- Good job.

20:22.104 --> 20:24.102
I'm proud of you.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.618
- Kat, are these?

20:28.978 --> 20:31.595
- Oh (laughs) gosh,
you found the photos.

20:31.695 --> 20:33.794
Yeah, crazy story.

20:33.894 --> 20:36.351
I was collecting a load
of old yearbook pics.

20:36.451 --> 20:38.190
The printer screwed up
by printing hundreds

20:38.290 --> 20:39.749
of that one photo.

20:39.849 --> 20:41.187
I've been meaning
to throw them out.

20:41.287 --> 20:43.286
- That is so funny.
- (laughs) Yes.

20:44.764 --> 20:46.942
So funny.

20:47.042 --> 20:49.141
- Road trip, here we come.

20:49.241 --> 20:50.699
(engine revving)
- Hang on.

20:50.799 --> 20:51.599
How come you're not
wearing your scarf anymore?

20:51.679 --> 20:52.618
- Oh, silly me.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.336
I must've left it at home.

20:54.436 --> 20:59.272
