01:03.346 --> 01:05.848
Good.

01:10.868 --> 01:13.480
Now, my little Hatsi, go to work.

01:13.481 --> 01:16.066
Come on, sweetie, smile.

01:16.151 --> 01:18.277
Don't be shy?

01:18.361 --> 01:20.946
These internet pictures are important.

01:21.030 --> 01:23.157
20 beautiful girls on one web page.

01:23.241 --> 01:25.826
Why do they pick you?

01:27.954 --> 01:29.705
You need a drink?

01:29.789 --> 01:31.832
Drink? No.

01:31.916 --> 01:34.668
Help you relax.

01:34.752 --> 01:36.670
I don't need drink for relax.

01:39.007 --> 01:41.008
Get undressed.

01:43.720 --> 01:46.805
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:46.890 --> 01:49.224
So turn around. Turn around.

01:49.309 --> 01:50.893
Smile.

02:00.236 --> 02:03.322
Don't move, don't move.
Yes, great.

02:07.243 --> 02:08.452
Yeah, yeah.

02:15.084 --> 02:17.503
Stop, stop.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.048
That's good.

02:26.429 --> 02:28.931
Head up, head up.

02:42.946 --> 02:46.740
So, how much...

02:46.824 --> 02:47.824
Anna.

02:50.411 --> 02:51.912
"How much money will I get?"

02:51.996 --> 02:54.039
How much money will I get?

02:54.123 --> 02:56.375
It depends. It depends.

02:56.459 --> 02:58.585
I had one girl... Come on.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.003
Okay.

03:00.088 --> 03:02.589
I had one girl... Bianka...

03:02.674 --> 03:04.841
was rich after one day.

03:07.512 --> 03:08.804
You have something to change?

03:10.515 --> 03:13.433
She was smart, you know?

03:13.518 --> 03:17.771
Her first client was a sheik, an Arab, ja?

03:17.855 --> 03:21.483
She saw a big aktentasche,
full of dollars.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.485
Sends me an S.M.S.,

03:23.570 --> 03:26.446
"Come quick."
and I come quick to the hotel room.

03:26.531 --> 03:30.450
"Hello, room service."

03:30.535 --> 03:33.453
And afterwards we split it,
50/50, you understand?

03:33.538 --> 03:35.038
Yes.

03:35.123 --> 03:37.666
That's good. Smile, smile,
smile, smile, smile.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.631
Okay, sit here.

03:44.716 --> 03:46.425
So...

03:46.509 --> 03:49.469
So do you choose a name already?

03:49.554 --> 03:50.804
Yes.

03:52.682 --> 03:53.890
Bianka.

03:56.394 --> 03:58.562
We are done, Bianka.

04:06.571 --> 04:10.073
So when will the pictures
be on internet?

04:10.158 --> 04:11.950
When you want, schatzi?

04:12.035 --> 04:13.744
Tonight.

04:13.828 --> 04:15.537
Tonight?

04:15.622 --> 04:17.623
No, schatzi, no.

04:17.707 --> 04:21.209
There are so many other girls waiting.

04:21.293 --> 04:23.253
Unless...

04:23.338 --> 04:26.048
you do something for me.

04:28.134 --> 04:29.593
Joke?

04:50.615 --> 04:53.867
She's cute.
She can work for me, too.

04:53.951 --> 04:56.119
My sister? Never.

04:56.204 --> 04:58.288
Why? She's too good for this?

04:58.373 --> 05:01.166
Yes. She has heart.

05:01.250 --> 05:05.462
- I have a heart.
- No, you don't.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.098
Hello?

06:41.726 --> 06:43.059
Good news.

06:43.144 --> 06:46.605
- Tomorrow, 7 p.m., Hotel Steigenberger.
- Rocco.

06:46.689 --> 06:50.066
Top manager,
in town for auto show.

06:51.819 --> 06:53.987
Are you going to say thank you?

06:54.071 --> 06:55.781
- Thank you.
- You see?

06:55.865 --> 06:57.616
You're good to me,
I'm good to you.

06:58.701 --> 07:02.621
Tomorrow, 7:00,
Hotel Steigenberger.

07:02.705 --> 07:05.791
Yeah? And don't be late?

07:05.875 --> 07:08.710
- Okay.
- And look elegant, nice, yeah?

07:08.795 --> 07:11.213
Understand? He's a top manager.

07:11.297 --> 07:13.048
- Okay?
- Top manager.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.953
<i>Ciao.</i>

07:46.332 --> 07:49.084
- "What is your job?"
- What is your job?

07:52.797 --> 07:54.089
"You are a nice man."

07:54.173 --> 07:55.674
You are a nice man.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.140
"Today"...

08:05.935 --> 08:08.854
"Today I went to a fitness center
with my girlfriend."

08:08.938 --> 08:11.064
Today I went
to a fitness center with...

09:19.342 --> 09:21.426
Hello.

09:21.510 --> 09:25.138
Okay, schatzi,
he's waiting at the bar.

09:25.222 --> 09:28.141
His name is Michael Daly.

09:28.225 --> 09:30.143
They are booking us for two hours.

09:30.227 --> 09:32.812
You don't take the money

09:32.897 --> 09:36.358
in public place.
You take the money at the room.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.276
As soon as you have the money,
you give me a call

09:38.361 --> 09:40.403
to say everything's okay. Okay?

09:40.488 --> 09:43.490
So good luck, schatzi?

09:43.991 --> 09:46.576
I think he's even more nervous than you.

10:37.795 --> 10:39.337
Hey, Michael.

10:40.589 --> 10:43.299
There you are.
I've been looking for you.

10:43.384 --> 10:46.136
Listen, we've come to tell you
that we have reconsidered

10:46.220 --> 10:48.638
and we agree to your price
at 400 per unit.

10:48.723 --> 10:50.265
Really?

10:50.349 --> 10:52.225
Yeah, plus delivery within 90 days.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.479
- So what do you say?
- That's very interesting.

10:56.564 --> 10:58.398
I'm sorry.
You catch me at a bad moment.

10:58.482 --> 11:00.608
All I can tell you is that you won't
find anyone in Europe

11:00.693 --> 11:02.444
- who can match that offer.
- As it happens,

11:02.528 --> 11:05.071
I got an offer yesterday
from the Estonian suppliers

11:05.156 --> 11:07.490
both your delivery
dates and price.

11:07.575 --> 11:09.993
Estonia? Okay.

11:10.077 --> 11:11.995
Well, you know, go ahead,
do your business in the Baltics.

11:12.079 --> 11:14.998
See how you like it.
We've done it, once.

11:15.082 --> 11:16.833
Never again.
Worse than the Russians.

11:16.917 --> 11:19.127
My responsibility is cutting the costs.

11:19.211 --> 11:21.421
And their figures are very good.

11:21.505 --> 11:23.131
Speaking of good figures,

11:23.215 --> 11:26.259
I see they started letting in
hookers here again.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.803
How do you know she's a hooker?

11:28.888 --> 11:30.305
Come on, it's obvious.
Look at her... the hair, the dress.

11:30.389 --> 11:31.890
Excuse me.

11:38.689 --> 11:40.607
Daddy can't speak right now.

11:40.691 --> 11:42.108
Can I get a dog, please?

11:42.193 --> 11:44.486
A dog? You want a dog?

11:44.570 --> 11:47.781
You know Louise in my class?
She got one for her birthday.

11:47.865 --> 11:50.617
I'd rather talk about it tomorrow
when I get home.

11:50.701 --> 11:53.161
- I'm not very keen, Ellie.
- Why not?

11:53.245 --> 11:56.831
Because I will be the one taking it
for a walk every night.

11:57.083 --> 12:00.085
- Please, please?!
- We...

12:00.169 --> 12:03.088
Don't get upset.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

12:03.172 --> 12:05.840
Yes, I'm coming back.
I'll see you in the play.

12:06.592 --> 12:08.093
All right, night, night.

12:08.177 --> 12:10.136
- Love you.
- I love you too.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.148
- "Bianka."
- Sorry about that.

12:22.233 --> 12:24.109
That's her. Her name is Bianka.

12:24.193 --> 12:28.488
What interests me is whether
she's here looking for business

12:28.572 --> 12:31.908
or waiting for a customer that she
has already arranged to meet,

12:31.992 --> 12:33.785
in which case I suggest we sit here

12:33.869 --> 12:35.578
and wait for the dirty bugger
to show up

12:35.663 --> 12:37.747
and then take pictures of him
to blackmail him with.

12:40.251 --> 12:43.753
Sadly there's no reviews yet or else
I could tell you how good she was...

12:43.838 --> 12:45.338
- Reviews?
- Yeah, reviews.

12:45.422 --> 12:47.173
Guys who have seen girls,
they write reviews

12:47.258 --> 12:48.591
and then post them on the site.

12:48.676 --> 12:52.220
I can't believe you want to share that
with me in a business meeting.

12:52.304 --> 12:53.805
Why? It's not a crime.

12:53.889 --> 12:56.599
It's hardly something
to be proud of either.

12:56.684 --> 12:59.227
I'm sorry. I didn't know that I was dealing
with the Moral Majority here.

12:59.311 --> 13:01.229
Just someone
with a little self-respect.

13:01.313 --> 13:03.022
Good luck with the rest of the fair.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.033
Hello, love, it's me.

13:57.661 --> 13:59.621
I'm sitting in a restaurant...

14:01.248 --> 14:03.750
alone, wishing you were here.

14:54.718 --> 14:56.636
Hello, sweetheart. Me again.

14:56.720 --> 15:00.265
Look, I'm just calling
to say good night.

15:00.349 --> 15:02.684
If you get this
in the next 10 minutes,

15:02.768 --> 15:05.687
call me back in my room
because my phone will be charging.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.230
If not,

15:08.649 --> 15:10.400
sweet dreams.

15:10.484 --> 15:12.402
We'll speak tomorrow.

15:12.486 --> 15:14.195
I love you

15:14.280 --> 15:17.240
more than ever.
I wanted you to know that.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.132
Hi, baby. Were you in the bath?

15:34.216 --> 15:36.634
As a matter of fact I was, yes.

15:36.719 --> 15:39.137
- Sorry?
- Oh, Michael.

15:39.221 --> 15:42.849
Reflecting on what a beautiful
evening I just had.

15:42.933 --> 15:44.851
How was yours?

15:44.935 --> 15:47.478
Fine, thank you.
It's a bit late for this, isn't it?

15:47.563 --> 15:49.480
Of course, I'm sorry.
I won't keep you long.

15:49.565 --> 15:51.482
It's just a...
just a quick word.

15:51.567 --> 15:55.236
Literally, it's one single word.

15:55.321 --> 15:56.738
Bianka.

15:58.782 --> 16:00.575
Got your attention now, haven't I?

16:01.452 --> 16:02.702
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:03.370 --> 16:04.746
Oh, I think you do, Michael.

16:04.830 --> 16:09.667
Because after you left, I went over
to chat to our little Slovakian friend.

16:09.752 --> 16:14.088
And after it turned out that her 7:00
appointment was a no-show,

16:14.173 --> 16:17.300
I did the only decent thing
that a gentleman could do

16:17.384 --> 16:20.136
in these circumstances
and I booked her.

16:20.220 --> 16:22.805
Now after the main event,

16:22.890 --> 16:25.141
which was excellent, by the way...

16:25.225 --> 16:28.269
Olympic, five-star review on its way...

16:28.354 --> 16:32.899
I asked her what she had been doing
at the bar of the hotel.

16:32.983 --> 16:34.901
Is this where she would
always drum up business,

16:34.985 --> 16:37.111
or had she been stood up?

16:37.196 --> 16:40.239
And she told me
that she had gone there

16:40.324 --> 16:43.701
to meet someone
from the automobile show.

16:43.827 --> 16:45.411
"Really?" I said. "Who?"

16:45.496 --> 16:47.622
'Cause I know
a lot of the guys, right?

16:47.706 --> 16:49.791
Now thinking that
she would say something like,

16:49.875 --> 16:52.668
"Mr. Presley" or "Mr. Pacino,"

16:52.753 --> 16:55.713
'cause they'd never be stupid enough
to give their actual name,

16:55.798 --> 16:57.298
do you know what she said?

16:59.218 --> 17:01.594
"Daly."

17:01.678 --> 17:03.888
"Michael Daly."

17:05.598 --> 17:08.768
So, Mr. Michael Daly,

17:09.103 --> 17:12.646
esteemed company director
with a little self-respect

17:12.731 --> 17:14.816
and wedding ring on finger,

17:14.900 --> 17:17.984
how about we have breakfast
tomorrow morning,

17:18.069 --> 17:21.196
you and me, and we renegotiate
whatever it is

17:21.281 --> 17:24.992
you agreed with those
Estonian gypsies?

17:25.077 --> 17:27.703
Let's say 7:30 in the restaurant?

23:36.531 --> 23:39.200
- Hi, Siobhan.
- Hello again.

24:03.975 --> 24:05.226
Coming.

24:12.859 --> 24:14.985
- Hi.
- You're half an hour late.

24:15.070 --> 24:16.904
I know.

24:16.988 --> 24:19.323
- Hi.
- I missed you.

24:19.407 --> 24:21.325
Rui?

24:21.409 --> 24:23.661
- I want to talk to you.
- Yeah?

24:23.745 --> 24:25.955
- Can we talk?
- Can I kiss you?

24:26.039 --> 24:28.958
Can we talk first, please?
I need to talk to you.

24:29.042 --> 24:31.210
Why? What's wrong?

24:33.839 --> 24:37.842
We... Will you stop? We can't...
We have to stop this.

24:38.552 --> 24:40.135
You're kidding, right?

24:40.220 --> 24:42.137
No. Can you put some clothes on, please?

24:42.222 --> 24:44.849
- Put your clothes on.
- Okay.

24:44.933 --> 24:47.393
Yeah, okay, I'm decent now.

24:47.477 --> 24:48.936
- Rui!
- Let's... Let's talk.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.522
What? It's not the first
time you see it, is it?

24:54.609 --> 24:57.403
Please help me out here a little bit.

24:57.487 --> 25:00.030
You are so beautiful. I missed you.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.451
Rui.

25:07.539 --> 25:10.124
What's wrong?
Do I make too many demands on you?

25:10.542 --> 25:12.835
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

25:12.919 --> 25:14.169
Do I make you...

25:15.130 --> 25:17.548
I make you happy, right?
I make you feel good.

25:17.632 --> 25:19.967
- Yes.
- We have a good time together?

25:20.051 --> 25:22.970
- Yes.
- So why change it?

25:23.054 --> 25:26.974
'Cause you're 25 years old.

25:27.058 --> 25:29.268
That's the beauty of it.
We're different.

25:29.352 --> 25:30.853
I have so many responsibilities.

25:30.937 --> 25:33.439
I love your responsibilities.

25:33.523 --> 25:35.774
We don't have a future.

25:36.943 --> 25:38.903
We have a beautiful present.

25:38.987 --> 25:42.531
We can have a future
if you'll let me try.

25:42.616 --> 25:45.367
- Rui.
- Let me be part of your life.

26:31.831 --> 26:35.626
And what about work?

26:36.294 --> 26:38.796
How should we do that?

26:38.880 --> 26:42.424
I mean, like total strangers?

26:42.717 --> 26:46.470
We... We have to stop that, too.

26:48.556 --> 26:53.143
You know you promised to...
to keep me in work, right?

26:54.646 --> 26:56.563
Said you would make me...

26:56.648 --> 26:59.358
a staff photographer and all that?

27:01.653 --> 27:03.445
That was very irresponsible.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.074
A little.

27:09.035 --> 27:11.328
That's okay, I guess.

27:18.294 --> 27:21.463
If you need help with money,
I can always do that.

27:24.300 --> 27:26.635
What was that, now?

27:26.720 --> 27:30.389
Rose, you just never understand,
you never accept

27:30.473 --> 27:32.349
how I feel about you, you know?

27:32.434 --> 27:34.643
What this means to me.
I actually love you.

27:34.728 --> 27:36.979
I'm sorry about that.

27:58.835 --> 28:02.463
And finally,
the "Day in the Life of the City" spread.

28:02.547 --> 28:05.215
We've locked down the text.
And with regard to the photos,

28:05.300 --> 28:08.761
Rose, I know you've suggested
your Brazilian photographer again.

28:08.845 --> 28:11.847
And I just want to confirm
we're all very happy with that idea.

28:11.931 --> 28:13.557
Well, I actually wanted
to make a suggestion.

28:13.641 --> 28:15.851
I feel that we've been using him
a lot recently.

28:15.935 --> 28:18.687
So there are two photographers
here whose work

28:18.772 --> 28:21.315
I think might suit
this story better.

28:23.943 --> 28:25.611
Well, thank you, everyone.

28:41.795 --> 28:44.421
Laura?

28:52.639 --> 28:54.723
Laura?

30:04.586 --> 30:06.378
Hi... Harriet?

30:06.462 --> 30:08.589
This is Rui.

30:08.673 --> 30:11.925
Is Laura there with you?
Did she call you or something?

30:12.010 --> 30:14.344
Because she's gone.
I don't know what happened.

30:14.429 --> 30:17.514
She packed up everything
and she is gone.

30:17.599 --> 30:20.392
I mean, she's really gone.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.605
Yeah, okay,
if she calls you or anything,

30:24.689 --> 30:28.567
just call me. Yeah.

30:28.651 --> 30:31.695
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

31:09.609 --> 31:11.735
Here's 80. Keep the change.

31:28.419 --> 31:29.878
I'm in the kitchen!

31:35.218 --> 31:36.843
- Hi.
- Hi, darling.

31:36.928 --> 31:38.845
- You all right?
- Fine.

31:38.930 --> 31:41.014
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

31:41.099 --> 31:45.227
- Have I got time for a shower?
- No, absolutely not. We're very late.

31:45.311 --> 31:46.687
All right, fresh shirt.

31:46.771 --> 31:48.897
There's one in the utility room.

31:48.982 --> 31:51.149
Esther left it there.

32:15.425 --> 32:17.134
When did you get home?

32:17.218 --> 32:19.928
Oh, about half an hour ago.

32:35.820 --> 32:37.904
I forgot, in the first year,
what was she?

32:37.989 --> 32:39.323
A cloud.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.910
And then, memorably, a comet.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.038
What is she this year?

32:46.622 --> 32:47.748
A tree?

32:47.832 --> 32:50.751
You've been away too much.
No, she's Shprintze.

32:50.835 --> 32:52.252
Shprintze?

32:53.838 --> 32:56.048
What is that?
Does it at least have a pulse?

32:56.132 --> 33:00.052
It's a Ukrainian Jewess.
They're doing "Fiddler on the Roof."

33:00.136 --> 33:03.388
And she... she's also got a line.

33:03.473 --> 33:05.974
Well?

33:06.059 --> 33:09.019
"I think he has a pleasing air."

33:12.732 --> 33:14.483
Is that it?

33:14.567 --> 33:17.819
Well, they...
she was going to say,

33:17.904 --> 33:21.031
"Mama, Yente's coming," but they thought
that might be a bit much for her, so...

33:28.748 --> 33:30.957
You're right.
I have been away too long.

33:34.170 --> 33:38.048
How can Grandma's recipe
be world famous?

33:38.132 --> 33:40.634
She never left the village
once in her life.

33:40.718 --> 33:42.928
Don't be clever, Chava.

33:43.012 --> 33:45.472
- Why not? I'll never be pretty...
- Excuse me.

33:45.598 --> 33:48.225
- Or a good singer. Allow me to excel in something.
- Sorry.

33:48.309 --> 33:51.395
I've seen Mosha outside.
He's so handsome.

33:51.479 --> 33:53.146
Isn't he a little bit cross-eyed?

33:53.231 --> 33:54.981
This is it. This is her cue.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.775
No, I think he's gorgeous.

33:56.859 --> 33:59.444
Don't be silly. He's hideous.

33:59.529 --> 34:01.780
Shprintze, we need you to cast
the deciding vote.

34:01.864 --> 34:04.574
What is he like?

34:08.788 --> 34:10.288
Oh, God, she's dried.

34:10.373 --> 34:14.000
"I think he has a pleasing air."

34:14.085 --> 34:16.210
Since you have nothing
to say, Shprintze,

34:16.295 --> 34:18.463
Tzeitel, what do you think?

34:18.547 --> 34:22.467
- I think he has a pleasing air.
- Excuse me.

34:22.552 --> 34:25.762
Motel's coming
and he's with Yente.

34:32.812 --> 34:34.146
Seeing all the audience.

34:34.230 --> 34:36.148
Feel a bit better?
Yes.

34:36.232 --> 34:38.525
Okay. I don't remember
you wearing this in the play.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.193
- No.
- You've stolen it from someone?

34:40.277 --> 34:42.195
No.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.156
It's a bit tight.

34:46.284 --> 34:47.909
Suits you.

34:47.994 --> 34:51.371
Mom, look what I have.
I have a beard.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.873
I look like a man.

34:55.042 --> 34:58.587
Yes, she was all right.
She did...

35:01.466 --> 35:03.258
She went out like a light.

35:04.385 --> 35:06.887
She was totally exhausted.

35:09.223 --> 35:11.683
You must be too.

35:13.811 --> 35:15.937
Yeah.

35:16.022 --> 35:19.024
It's been a crazy few days.

35:25.490 --> 35:27.991
How did it go in Vienna?

35:28.075 --> 35:30.744
Fine.

35:30.828 --> 35:33.246
Did you get your deal done?

35:36.334 --> 35:38.960
You did have a deal to do there,
didn't you?

35:39.045 --> 35:43.006
- I did and I did.
- That's good. That's great.

35:51.849 --> 35:55.936
That means a trip to Estonia
in the near future.

35:58.439 --> 36:00.690
Berlin, actually.

36:02.443 --> 36:05.070
Do you know,
I've never been to Berlin.

36:05.154 --> 36:08.573
- How was it here?
- It was fine.

36:13.538 --> 36:15.705
I got your messages last night.

36:15.790 --> 36:18.041
You sounded emotional.

36:19.752 --> 36:21.419
Did I?

36:21.504 --> 36:23.672
Am I wrong?

36:26.384 --> 36:27.551
No.

36:28.970 --> 36:33.306
Well, I tried to call you straight back,
but it went to voice-mail so...

36:36.686 --> 36:39.729
Anyway, it was very nice what you said.

36:42.316 --> 36:43.817
What did I say?

36:45.611 --> 36:48.530
You said that you wished I was there.

36:52.743 --> 36:54.911
It's true, I did.

36:54.996 --> 36:57.205
That's nice.

37:49.050 --> 37:52.886
Morning, Tyler.
So you asked to see me.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.804
Clear.

37:54.889 --> 37:57.515
I'm so pleased you agreed
to do this halfway house.

37:57.600 --> 38:00.310
- Clear.
- Miss Olsen, I believe...

38:00.394 --> 38:03.104
I believe I've done everything
you've asked me here.

38:03.189 --> 38:05.357
You have. You've worked hard.

38:05.441 --> 38:06.691
Yeah.

38:07.943 --> 38:10.236
But what if I'm no different?

38:10.321 --> 38:12.238
You know,
after everything we've done,

38:12.323 --> 38:15.909
what if...
what if I haven't changed?

38:18.579 --> 38:21.122
The way I'm feeling right now
is that maybe you were right...

38:21.207 --> 38:23.333
maybe I should go
to that halfway house first...

38:25.044 --> 38:27.128
for my own protection.

38:28.422 --> 38:30.548
Because like you said,

38:30.633 --> 38:34.386
I've been in... I've been
in an all-male situation here

38:34.679 --> 38:37.472
for six... six years.

38:38.015 --> 38:42.936
And it's going to be quite a shock
being on the outside with all the...

38:43.854 --> 38:46.356
the temptations and distractions.

38:47.650 --> 38:49.567
Yes, it is.

38:49.652 --> 38:52.570
And I would hate for everything
that we've done together

38:52.655 --> 38:54.531
to be undone.

38:58.119 --> 39:00.704
You said you'd spoken
to some people in Louisville

39:00.788 --> 39:04.624
who have experience
working with people like me?

39:04.959 --> 39:07.919
If I remember, they were even
happy to fly over here

39:08.003 --> 39:11.631
to collect you and accompany you
on the plane.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.134
On the plane?

39:14.218 --> 39:17.095
No, they can... they can spare
themselves that.

39:17.179 --> 39:20.098
They can just meet me
at the Louisville airport.

39:21.934 --> 39:25.562
Tyler, I am so happy
that you've agreed to do this.

39:25.646 --> 39:27.355
You think it's right?

39:27.440 --> 39:29.983
- Yes, I do.
- 'Kay.

39:34.697 --> 39:37.532
I never want to end up
in a place like this again.

40:50.731 --> 40:52.232
Hi.

40:52.316 --> 40:54.359
Thank you.

40:54.443 --> 40:56.861
I wasn't sure if you were hungry.

40:58.322 --> 41:01.241
So the choice is chicken or fish.

41:01.325 --> 41:03.576
I got you chicken.

41:03.661 --> 41:07.372
Though now I'm eating it myself,
I'm not sure which one I got.

41:07.456 --> 41:10.041
- I'm not hungry.
- You sure?

41:10.125 --> 41:12.919
They said they wouldn't
be coming around again.

41:13.003 --> 41:15.213
Maybe some wine.

41:15.297 --> 41:16.923
Okay, have mine as well.

41:17.007 --> 41:19.259
You don't want it?

41:19.343 --> 41:20.885
No, I've got some work to do.

41:21.846 --> 41:24.639
Going direct to Denver?

41:26.475 --> 41:28.810
Miami.

41:28.894 --> 41:31.020
Then home to Rio de Janeiro.

41:33.774 --> 41:36.067
Been in London long?

41:36.151 --> 41:39.529
Too long, studying,

41:40.489 --> 41:42.949
doing stupid jobs,

41:43.033 --> 41:46.619
but mostly waiting at home while
my boyfriend slept with other women.

41:48.956 --> 41:51.332
That's bad.

41:51.417 --> 41:53.209
Sorry to drink like this.

41:53.294 --> 41:55.253
It's not very elegant,
but I want to sleep.

41:55.337 --> 41:58.339
That's okay, I understand.

41:58.424 --> 42:00.592
- You okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

42:00.676 --> 42:02.385
Okay.

42:03.929 --> 42:06.389
You a Manchester United fan?

42:30.289 --> 42:31.873
Sorry.

42:31.957 --> 42:34.792
It's okay. My daughter, Julia.

42:35.252 --> 42:36.836
Missing?

42:36.921 --> 42:38.671
Yes.

42:38.756 --> 42:42.216
Sadly, some think she's long dead.

42:43.510 --> 42:47.096
- I'm sorry.
- No.

42:47.181 --> 42:49.098
She's beautiful.

42:49.183 --> 42:50.642
Yes, she is.

42:50.726 --> 42:52.810
You look so happy.

42:52.895 --> 42:55.605
Yeah, I was.

42:59.360 --> 43:03.738
It's before she ran away.
Thank you.

43:14.750 --> 43:17.085
Where did she run to?

43:18.504 --> 43:20.922
America?

43:21.006 --> 43:23.216
Yeah, eventually.

43:23.300 --> 43:26.594
That's where we think she ended up.

43:26.679 --> 43:29.430
Can I ask why?

43:29.515 --> 43:31.724
- Why she ran away?
- Yeah.

43:31.809 --> 43:35.478
Yes, you can, but I don't think
you'll like me when I've told you.

43:35.562 --> 43:37.981
Is it important if I like you?

43:38.065 --> 43:40.733
No, not remotely.

43:43.195 --> 43:47.281
Well, my daughter and I have
the same initial, "J."

43:47.866 --> 43:52.662
One day she opened the wrong letter
and found out I was having an affair.

43:52.746 --> 43:54.789
She was devastated.

43:54.873 --> 43:58.251
She told me if I didn't stop,
she would tell her mother.

43:59.128 --> 44:02.588
Of course I agreed to stop,
but I didn't.

44:03.882 --> 44:05.383
I couldn't.

44:06.427 --> 44:09.554
And so she told her mother.
Her mother screamed at me

44:09.638 --> 44:13.558
and I screamed at my daughter.
My daughter ran away,

44:13.642 --> 44:17.395
presumably
to the arms of someone

44:17.479 --> 44:19.939
who did her harm, I guess.

44:25.821 --> 44:29.657
Your daughter...
Why do people think she's...

44:29.742 --> 44:31.617
- Dead?
- Yes.

44:31.702 --> 44:35.621
Oh, silence, mostly,
especially to her mother.

44:35.706 --> 44:40.376
So unlike Julia.
That and the sheer length of time.

44:40.461 --> 44:43.379
And you're going
to Phoenix because...

44:43.464 --> 44:45.882
Arizona state police
have found the body of a woman

44:45.966 --> 44:51.596
reported to be the same age
white, British, died in a fire.

44:52.723 --> 44:56.809
And I'm taking out samples of DNA,

44:56.894 --> 45:01.481
bits and pieces of Julia's hair
we kept from childhood.

45:01.565 --> 45:03.066
Madness, really.

45:03.150 --> 45:05.985
They closed the file
on Julia years ago.

45:06.820 --> 45:09.572
Well, when you're a father,

45:09.656 --> 45:12.325
- what can you do?
- Yeah.

45:12.409 --> 45:14.160
You can't give up, you know?

45:14.244 --> 45:16.037
- No.
- No.

45:16.121 --> 45:18.039
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

45:18.123 --> 45:19.874
Bye.

45:34.681 --> 45:37.433
Excuse me.

45:39.603 --> 45:41.938
- Hi.
- You didn't get away either.

45:42.022 --> 45:45.191
- No.
- I've heard them say it could be quite a wait.

45:45.275 --> 45:46.776
- Really?
- Yeah, I also heard them say

45:46.860 --> 45:49.028
they may be putting us
in hotels for the night.

45:49.113 --> 45:52.323
Oh, God. They told me
to report back at 7:00.

45:52.407 --> 45:55.868
Yeah, me too. I think that's to collect
the vouchers for the hotels.

45:55.953 --> 45:58.204
Look, if you fancy it,

45:58.288 --> 46:02.166
I saw a reasonably good restaurant
up there by the phones.

46:02.251 --> 46:04.168
Maybe we could get together for an hour

46:04.253 --> 46:06.170
and, you know, in an hour's time
have something to eat?

46:06.255 --> 46:09.465
Because it beats eating room service
in our separate hotels.

46:09.550 --> 46:11.259
What do you think?

46:11.343 --> 46:12.844
- Yeah, okay.
- Good.

46:12.928 --> 46:14.053
Laura.

46:14.138 --> 46:16.430
Laura. I'm Laura.

46:16.515 --> 46:18.307
- John.
- Okay.

46:18.392 --> 46:20.226
Laura, pretty name.
All right, see you then.

46:20.310 --> 46:21.769
- Thank you. See you.
- Bye.

46:49.214 --> 46:51.090
How are you doing, Tyler?

46:51.175 --> 46:53.426
It's crazy here.
There are people everywhere.

46:53.510 --> 46:56.429
Some are crying.
Some are getting angry.

46:56.513 --> 46:59.390
It's... it's just a stress situation.

46:59.641 --> 47:01.601
I hear what you're saying
about everyone,

47:01.685 --> 47:02.935
but how are you?

47:03.812 --> 47:05.354
How are you doing?

47:07.149 --> 47:08.774
What? I'm... I'm okay.

47:09.526 --> 47:13.154
Though I'm beginning
to wish I had said yes

47:13.238 --> 47:16.115
to those guys
escorting me on the flight.

47:16.200 --> 47:20.036
If I'm honest,
I do feel a little...

47:22.039 --> 47:23.456
triggered.

47:23.540 --> 47:25.833
Well, I'm gonna make sure
we get help to you.

47:26.168 --> 47:30.087
The second I hang up this phone,
that's what I'm going to get on to.

47:30.172 --> 47:31.422
Okay?

47:31.506 --> 47:34.008
But I want you to remember

47:34.092 --> 47:36.135
that if you weren't able
to cope with this challenge,

47:36.220 --> 47:37.970
it wouldn't have been presented to you.

47:38.055 --> 47:39.263
You think?

47:39.348 --> 47:41.474
Absolutely.

47:41.558 --> 47:45.061
Now go find somewhere
quiet and safe to sit.

47:45.145 --> 47:47.480
I'll make a few calls.
But I'd like for you to call me

47:47.564 --> 47:50.983
in exactly an hour from now, okay?

47:51.068 --> 47:52.693
One hour.

47:52.778 --> 47:54.237
You'll be fine.

47:56.198 --> 47:57.949
Thank you, Miss Olsen.

47:58.325 --> 48:00.326
All right, take care.

48:28.021 --> 48:29.689
That's my seat.

48:30.315 --> 48:32.316
- Really?
- Didn't see my stuff?

48:32.401 --> 48:34.694
What stuff?

48:34.778 --> 48:37.363
The stuff that I left...
deliberately left right here.

48:37.447 --> 48:39.573
No, I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

48:39.658 --> 48:41.617
Well, you see it now, don't you?

48:41.702 --> 48:43.536
Yeah, I do.

48:43.620 --> 48:47.832
Okay. Okay, no problem.
I can... can go.

48:47.916 --> 48:49.542
Okay, folks.

48:49.626 --> 48:53.629
Some wine, two glasses.

48:53.714 --> 48:56.424
And I'll get you some bread.

49:00.595 --> 49:02.388
I'm sorry.

49:02.472 --> 49:05.808
I... I ordered a drink
for me and my friend.

49:05.892 --> 49:08.811
He'll be here in a second.

49:08.895 --> 49:11.564
Can I just stay here
until he comes?

49:11.648 --> 49:13.566
As soon as he comes,
we'll move.

49:13.650 --> 49:15.651
I promise.

49:18.780 --> 49:20.698
You want a glass of wine?

49:20.782 --> 49:23.409
I don't want a glass of wine.

49:25.662 --> 49:27.330
He shouldn't be long.

49:53.106 --> 49:54.690
Where are you headed?

49:55.233 --> 49:58.069
Louisville, Kentucky.

49:58.528 --> 49:59.820
Rio, Brazil.

50:00.697 --> 50:02.698
They give you a hotel room yet?

50:05.035 --> 50:07.745
- Hotel room?
- Yeah. No, they did.

50:07.829 --> 50:10.790
I'm just hoping these people
meet me here first.

50:13.251 --> 50:14.543
I'm Laura, by the way.

50:14.628 --> 50:16.504
Tyler.

50:20.258 --> 50:21.592
You okay?

50:21.676 --> 50:24.095
What's with all the questions?

50:24.721 --> 50:26.222
Just being friendly.

50:29.309 --> 50:31.936
- Switch seats with me.
- Sorry?

50:32.020 --> 50:34.563
Would you mind
switching seats with me?

50:34.648 --> 50:36.649
I'm waiting for some friends.

50:37.359 --> 50:39.985
So if I sit here,
I can see them coming.

50:40.070 --> 50:41.529
Oh, okay.

50:41.613 --> 50:43.406
Okay, sorry.

50:51.581 --> 50:53.290
So who's meeting you here?

50:53.834 --> 50:55.918
Just someone I met on the plane.

50:56.002 --> 50:58.337
He sat next to me and we got talking.

50:58.880 --> 51:01.006
Just talking? We just talkin', too?

51:03.343 --> 51:05.136
What else are we doing?

51:05.929 --> 51:10.224
Well, I don't know.
I mean, now I'm not doing anything.

51:11.435 --> 51:12.476
But you...

51:13.979 --> 51:17.857
- What am I doing?
- You tell me.

51:19.860 --> 51:23.404
I don't know. Just passing the time,
making conversation.

51:27.451 --> 51:28.951
You ever been to Brazil?

51:29.035 --> 51:30.786
No.

51:32.122 --> 51:35.416
You would like it.
Everyone likes it.

51:36.209 --> 51:38.669
We have the best beaches
in the world.

51:39.963 --> 51:42.923
It's the first thing I'm going to do
when I get home,

51:43.008 --> 51:44.884
go to the beach,

51:44.968 --> 51:48.137
lie down, close my eyes,

51:49.639 --> 51:51.140
and smoke a joint.

51:53.685 --> 51:54.727
What?

51:54.811 --> 51:56.395
You're bad.

51:57.898 --> 51:59.732
Me?

51:59.816 --> 52:01.609
No, I'm not.

52:01.693 --> 52:06.322
364 days of the year
I'm a good Catholic girl.

52:06.406 --> 52:08.741
Right now I'm just feeding off
the situation.

52:08.825 --> 52:10.451
What situation?

52:11.828 --> 52:13.787
The situation we're in now.

52:14.581 --> 52:18.000
No one knows where we are.
No one can reach us.

52:19.920 --> 52:21.629
It's perfect.

52:21.838 --> 52:23.714
For what?

52:27.093 --> 52:29.094
I don't know.

52:32.641 --> 52:34.308
You tell me.

52:37.270 --> 52:39.021
Stay there a second.

52:39.105 --> 52:40.731
Okay?

52:49.991 --> 52:52.785
His name's McGregor,
Tyler McGregor,

52:52.869 --> 52:54.787
on flight 240 to Louisville.

52:54.871 --> 52:56.789
He's newly released from jail

52:56.873 --> 52:59.083
and he called me
in a highly stressed state.

52:59.167 --> 53:01.627
Ma'am, we have an airport shutdown
and 60 grounded flights.

53:01.711 --> 53:03.629
We are extremely stretched.

53:03.713 --> 53:05.506
I need to know if you consider
this McGregor

53:05.590 --> 53:06.966
to be a threat to public safety.

53:07.050 --> 53:08.509
It's hard to say.

53:08.593 --> 53:10.511
I mean, I think
we'd all feel a lot better,

53:10.595 --> 53:12.513
including him,
if you could keep an eye on him.

53:12.597 --> 53:14.056
Ma'am, is that a yes or a no?

53:15.225 --> 53:16.433
Yes.

53:17.060 --> 53:19.395
Right, okay. Thank you,
I'll get back to you.

53:21.356 --> 53:23.816
Security to information desk, over.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.859
This is information.
Go ahead, security, over.

53:25.944 --> 53:29.905
Yeah, I need you to put out a call
for passenger McGregor,

53:30.031 --> 53:35.995
- Tyler McGregor on flight 240 to Louisville, over.
- "McGregor... 240 to Louisville."

53:36.079 --> 53:39.039
Yeah, tell him to report
to your desk immediately.

53:40.417 --> 53:42.543
Is that it? No more information
than that?

53:42.627 --> 53:44.712
He's a convicted sex offender.

53:44.796 --> 53:48.716
You want to put that out over
the loudspeaker, be my guest. Over.

53:50.385 --> 53:52.261
Let's have a drink.

53:53.096 --> 53:55.097
- Okay.
- Come with me.

53:57.225 --> 53:58.892
I'm sorry.

53:58.977 --> 54:00.769
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54:00.854 --> 54:02.438
It's okay.

54:02.522 --> 54:04.106
So? You want to come?

54:05.775 --> 54:06.942
Yeah.

54:09.821 --> 54:12.072
Would passenger McGregor

54:12.157 --> 54:15.868
traveling on the 1830
flight 240 to Louisville

54:15.952 --> 54:18.495
please report to the information desk
immediately?

54:18.580 --> 54:21.415
That's passenger McGregor
to the information desk.

54:21.499 --> 54:22.708
Thank you.

54:28.590 --> 54:32.384
Sir, would you happen to be
John looking for Laura?

54:32.469 --> 54:34.678
- Yeah.
- She described you well.

54:34.763 --> 54:36.472
She left a message for you.

54:36.556 --> 54:38.557
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:49.110 --> 54:50.611
Okay.

54:53.198 --> 54:55.366
Welcome to my crib.

54:55.784 --> 54:57.826
Very luxurious.

54:59.329 --> 55:02.164
One window, with a view of...

55:03.166 --> 55:04.541
a brick wall.

55:06.252 --> 55:08.003
Come on in.

55:08.088 --> 55:09.838
I should really go.

55:09.923 --> 55:12.675
Go where? Do what?

55:13.176 --> 55:15.803
Come on, we're stuck here.

55:25.271 --> 55:26.772
I wonder could you help me?

55:26.856 --> 55:29.024
Could you put out a call for a passenger
who's traveling to Miami?

55:29.109 --> 55:29.942
Passenger's name?

55:30.026 --> 55:32.319
Well, I don't know her last name,
but the first name is Laura.

55:32.404 --> 55:34.279
We arranged to meet
in the restaurant across by...

55:34.364 --> 55:35.906
Okay, sir,
this is an information desk.

55:35.990 --> 55:37.658
I know that, I know that.
But this young girl,

55:37.742 --> 55:39.868
she's a kid and she could
be in trouble. She's missing.

55:39.953 --> 55:41.954
Sir, I'm busy. I'm going to have
to ask you to step away...

55:42.038 --> 55:43.580
One call, that's it. 30 seconds.
You could have done it by now.

55:43.665 --> 55:45.582
Hey, fellas, will you
get this guy out of here?

55:45.667 --> 55:48.252
What's your problem?
Screw you.

55:48.336 --> 55:50.087
Make yourself useful.

55:50.922 --> 55:53.257
Find us something to watch.

55:53.341 --> 55:55.926
And relax, will you?

55:56.136 --> 56:00.681
So we have a $30 credit
for food and drink.

56:01.558 --> 56:03.892
- But we're not hungry, right?
- No.

56:05.562 --> 56:07.187
So let's celebrate instead,

56:08.189 --> 56:10.065
or drown our sorrows.

56:10.900 --> 56:11.942
Which?

56:12.902 --> 56:17.114
- You've had too much already.
- Too much sorrows.

56:17.991 --> 56:19.283
I agree.

56:21.786 --> 56:23.203
No, too much to drink.

56:24.914 --> 56:26.165
Don't be silly.

56:29.919 --> 56:31.128
Yeah.

56:31.921 --> 56:33.672
I really should go.

56:34.048 --> 56:35.215
Why?

56:36.426 --> 56:37.885
Why do you want to go?

56:38.636 --> 56:41.680
Why does every man
nowadays want to leave me?

56:42.682 --> 56:44.308
Is there something wrong with me?

56:44.559 --> 56:45.601
No.

56:46.227 --> 56:48.061
God, no, you're...

56:49.773 --> 56:51.273
you're fine.

56:52.984 --> 56:55.277
- Then prove it.
- Please.

56:56.279 --> 56:57.738
Kiss me.

56:58.615 --> 57:00.073
I can't.

57:01.868 --> 57:02.910
Why not?

57:03.703 --> 57:05.287
Kiss me, come on.

57:07.624 --> 57:09.291
You're drunk.

57:10.251 --> 57:12.085
You don't like me.

57:13.296 --> 57:15.255
Then what's the problem?

57:15.965 --> 57:17.549
What's the problem?

57:17.801 --> 57:20.511
- What's the problem?
- Please don't do that.

58:09.727 --> 58:11.728
Say you're fuckin' sorry.

58:15.567 --> 58:17.568
Say you're fuckin' sorry.

01:00:11.683 --> 01:00:15.143
Hey, Laura? Laura.

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:17.187
Hey.

01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:18.939
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

01:00:19.023 --> 01:00:21.233
- Hi.
- How you doing? All right?

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:24.403
- You okay? I was worried about you.
- I'm fine. Sore head.

01:00:24.862 --> 01:00:26.697
- Hungover?
- Little bit.

01:00:26.781 --> 01:00:28.699
- Yeah.
- Sorry about last night.

01:00:28.783 --> 01:00:30.909
That's no problem.
I got your note. Thanks.

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.327
- Nice note.
- Good.

01:00:32.412 --> 01:00:34.037
And so did you have fun?

01:00:34.122 --> 01:00:35.497
I'm not sure.

01:00:35.957 --> 01:00:37.624
I think I must have fallen asleep.

01:00:37.709 --> 01:00:39.918
Oh, I know all about that stuff. Yeah.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:41.920
It's been a crazy few days.

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.422
I bet it has.

01:00:44.215 --> 01:00:46.216
- Anyway...
- So...

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.719
- Good luck. Have a good journey.
- Yeah.

01:00:48.803 --> 01:00:50.387
You really take care now.

01:00:50.471 --> 01:00:52.431
It was really nice
to meet you again.

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:54.266
It was great to talk to you.
Great to meet you.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:56.268
- Maybe we'll meet again one day.
- Yeah.

01:01:00.481 --> 01:01:02.941
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.943
- See ya.
- See ya. Travel safe.

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:06.695
Yeah, you stay out of trouble.

01:01:06.779 --> 01:01:09.489
- I'm gonna try.
- I'm keeping my eye on you.

01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:21.793
Have a good flight.

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.104
You did it, Tyler.

01:01:41.189 --> 01:01:43.690
You made the call.
You did the right thing.

01:01:44.609 --> 01:01:46.109
I'm so proud of you.

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.487
Stay in touch.

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:18.892
No, thank you.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.187
Thank you.

01:02:24.816 --> 01:02:26.733
See you next time.

01:02:28.903 --> 01:02:30.904
"See you next time."

01:02:30.988 --> 01:02:34.991
They were four innocent enough words,
but they went through me like a knife.

01:02:35.076 --> 01:02:37.661
Because in that moment, I realized to them
I'd become a familiar face,

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:41.832
a joke... the British guy
who was running a one-man campaign,

01:02:42.083 --> 01:02:43.792
stubbornly scratching away,
refusing to do

01:02:43.876 --> 01:02:47.462
what you've all been urging me to do
for years and years,

01:02:47.547 --> 01:02:49.464
move on, let go, and all that stuff.

01:02:51.384 --> 01:02:52.926
Yeah, it's not easy.

01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:55.387
I got sober a long time ago
out in Los Angeles...

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:58.431
I don't know...
35, 36 years ago.

01:02:58.516 --> 01:03:00.684
And I was crazy. I was insane.
I was sickened to death,

01:03:00.768 --> 01:03:05.147
drunk and insane, and...
I was sentenced to AA meetings.

01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:07.149
And I hated...
I hated the damn things.

01:03:07.233 --> 01:03:11.111
I hated all this God stuff.
It made me want to puke.

01:03:11.612 --> 01:03:14.656
You know, "Move on. Let go, let God.
Surrender and win" and all this.

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.909
I was a winner.
I've been a winner all my life.

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:20.912
And...

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:22.914
but I was fighting all the time.

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.624
And anyway,
to cut a long story short,

01:03:24.709 --> 01:03:27.961
I met... there was this old man.
He was a priest,

01:03:28.045 --> 01:03:31.715
a Jesuit priest. His name was Joe Riley,
Father Joe Riley.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:33.925
And I'll never forget him
as long as I live.

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:37.470
One night I was about to leave the meeting.
I had to get the hell out.

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:40.015
And he stood in my way, said,
"Where the hell do you think you're going?"

01:03:40.099 --> 01:03:41.600
I said, "You get out of my way."

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:43.602
He said, "You're not going anywhere."

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:46.563
But he looked up into my face,
and he had these piercing blue eyes,

01:03:46.647 --> 01:03:48.732
a cigarette in his mouth.
He said, "You know..."

01:03:48.816 --> 01:03:51.067
He said, "You look like to me...
You look like"

01:03:51.152 --> 01:03:53.778
you're busted, disgusted
and not to be trusted."

01:03:55.114 --> 01:03:56.698
And he was right.

01:03:58.326 --> 01:04:01.703
I wasn't to be trusted by anyone.
I'd never trust myself either.

01:04:01.787 --> 01:04:03.914
And one day I asked him...
I said, "Okay, Father",

01:04:03.998 --> 01:04:06.458
you know all the"... I called him Father
and he got a kick out of that.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.501
I said, "You know all the answers.
You're a pretty smart guy."

01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:10.629
What's the shortest, most powerful
prayer in the world?"

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:12.172
'Cause I was fast.
I needed quick answers.

01:04:12.256 --> 01:04:14.257
'Cause I wanted to be back
on the fast track.

01:04:14.342 --> 01:04:16.760
I said, "What is the fastest, most
powerful prayer in the world?"

01:04:16.844 --> 01:04:19.137
He said, "The fastest, most powerful
prayer in the world..."

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:21.890
He looked at me and he said, "The fastest,
most powerful prayer in the world",

01:04:21.974 --> 01:04:25.101
my friend, is 'Fuck it."'

01:04:25.186 --> 01:04:27.646
Father Joe Riley.

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:30.941
He was a Jesuit priest...
"Fuck it." Can you believe it?

01:04:31.025 --> 01:04:33.693
He said, "it's the prayer
of release and surrender."

01:04:33.778 --> 01:04:37.697
And I felt the whole weight of the world
going off my shoulders.

01:04:37.865 --> 01:04:40.200
And just before Father Riley died,

01:04:40.284 --> 01:04:42.994
I asked him... I said, "How do I get it?
How do I know?"

01:04:43.412 --> 01:04:45.455
He said, "You will see
when you're ready to see."

01:04:45.539 --> 01:04:47.582
You will hear when you're ready to hear."

01:04:47.667 --> 01:04:50.543
He said,
"You're a particularly tough nut."

01:04:50.628 --> 01:04:54.881
And the weird thing is,
that happened two days ago.

01:04:54.966 --> 01:04:57.884
I was traveling on my way here...

01:04:57.969 --> 01:05:00.303
my journey here
with a young girl from Brazil.

01:05:00.388 --> 01:05:03.431
She was a kid, beautiful little thing.
Name was Laura.

01:05:04.392 --> 01:05:06.393
And there was a snowstorm at Denver.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.688
Flights were delayed
and so we arranged to have dinner.

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.648
And when I showed up,
she wasn't there.

01:05:11.732 --> 01:05:14.484
But she left me this note.
Hold that, will you?

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:19.739
And she said,
"Ran into someone cute.

01:05:19.824 --> 01:05:22.909
"Never done this kind of thing before.

01:05:22.994 --> 01:05:25.620
"But you only live once.

01:05:25.705 --> 01:05:28.456
How many chances do we get?"

01:05:32.378 --> 01:05:35.046
"Out of the mouths
of babies and sucklings,

01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:37.882
thou hast perfected praise."

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:40.760
The guy was right,
whoever wrote that stuff.

01:05:40.845 --> 01:05:43.930
And it's taken me all these years.

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:47.142
I tell you, if my...

01:05:49.395 --> 01:05:50.895
if my daughter is alive,

01:05:52.523 --> 01:05:55.692
she knows where I am,
where to find me.

01:05:55.776 --> 01:06:00.864
And her silence means that she's probably
made the choice not to be in touch.

01:06:00.948 --> 01:06:03.033
But if she's dead...

01:06:06.787 --> 01:06:08.288
then she's dead.

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:13.752
And she's gone forever.

01:06:14.253 --> 01:06:16.421
And I have to move on

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.757
and forget and let go.

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:20.550
Weird stuff.

01:06:24.722 --> 01:06:27.474
I tell you, it's a mystery, all of it.

01:06:27.558 --> 01:06:30.477
Anyway, I'll shut up now.
Thanks for listening.

01:06:30.561 --> 01:06:31.936
Thank you, John.

01:06:33.564 --> 01:06:37.317
Okay, before I open the meeting
to our regular members,

01:06:37.401 --> 01:06:39.861
we have another guest from overseas.

01:06:39.945 --> 01:06:41.404
Valentina?

01:06:41.489 --> 01:06:44.115
Yes. Hello, my name is Valentina.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.534
Welcome, Valentina.

01:06:46.619 --> 01:06:48.328
I'm an alcoholic.

01:06:49.747 --> 01:06:52.040
I'm here from Europe
visiting my sister,

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.584
waiting outside.

01:06:54.668 --> 01:06:58.755
She has married an American
who lives here in Phoenix.

01:06:58.839 --> 01:07:02.509
And they're so happy, so in love.

01:07:02.593 --> 01:07:05.804
This makes me sick.

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:09.891
Tomorrow I will fly home
to my Russian husband.

01:07:12.812 --> 01:07:16.648
We married very young.
We were like children.

01:07:17.108 --> 01:07:20.485
But now we've grown up,
become different people.

01:07:24.615 --> 01:07:26.699
I am sober three years.

01:07:26.784 --> 01:07:30.370
I have a good new job, a new life,

01:07:30.496 --> 01:07:33.289
but he's still the same...

01:07:33.374 --> 01:07:37.252
doing bad things,
working with bad people.

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.631
For a long time
I'm waiting for him to change.

01:07:41.715 --> 01:07:44.217
And...

01:07:44.301 --> 01:07:48.138
like Brazilian girl said,
"You only live once.

01:07:48.514 --> 01:07:50.640
How many chances do we have?"

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:53.601
I don't want to wait anymore.

01:07:53.686 --> 01:07:56.312
So maybe this is the time.

01:07:58.524 --> 01:08:01.860
Plus there is someone else
I am interested in.

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:07.574
A nice man, a good man.
My boss, actually.

01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:12.954
And he knows nothing from my past.

01:08:13.164 --> 01:08:16.040
He thinks I am a good innocent girl.

01:08:17.376 --> 01:08:21.504
But if we get together,
he will get a shock the first night.

01:10:13.993 --> 01:10:15.994
Valentina.

01:10:17.329 --> 01:10:19.038
Valentina.

01:11:04.376 --> 01:11:06.836
- Hi.
- Serioja.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.048
I'm coming to the city tomorrow
and would like some company.

01:11:10.341 --> 01:11:12.258
What have you got for me?

01:11:12.593 --> 01:11:14.761
Who have you got for me?

01:11:14.845 --> 01:11:16.763
Best... I need the best.

01:11:18.057 --> 01:11:19.349
Kate?

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.352
Maybe, maybe.

01:11:22.436 --> 01:11:25.188
Maybe do you have a brunette?

01:11:25.397 --> 01:11:29.484
Maybe do you have someone new?

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.878
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:15:54.666 --> 01:15:56.083
<i>Pardon.</i>

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.178
Problem?

01:16:28.742 --> 01:16:30.201
<i>Attendez.</i>

01:16:31.244 --> 01:16:32.745
<i>Voilà.</i>

01:18:21.772 --> 01:18:23.105
Valentina...

01:19:12.656 --> 01:19:14.406
English is made up from words

01:19:14.491 --> 01:19:15.950
borrowed from various languages.

01:19:16.034 --> 01:19:17.576
So words in English...

01:19:17.661 --> 01:19:19.703
Can give rise to pronunciation problems.

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:22.373
When "Y" comes
at the beginning of a word,

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:24.542
it acts as a consonant.

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:26.544
- Yellow.
- Yellow.

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:28.129
- Year.
- Year.

01:19:28.213 --> 01:19:29.588
- Yet.
- Yet.

01:19:29.673 --> 01:19:31.382
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday.

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:34.385
- Yoke.
- Yoke, yoke.

01:21:16.029 --> 01:21:17.488
Sacha!

01:22:15.714 --> 01:22:18.632
Remember, when two vowels go walking,

01:22:18.717 --> 01:22:20.843
only one does the talking.

01:22:21.886 --> 01:22:22.886
Repeat after me.

01:22:33.231 --> 01:22:36.608
No fucking aisle seat ever.

01:22:37.068 --> 01:22:39.194
Repeat after me.

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:43.657
- No...
- No...

01:22:43.742 --> 01:22:44.616
- fucking...
- Fucking...

01:22:44.701 --> 01:22:45.743
- Aisle seat.
- Aisle seat.

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:49.747
Don't park my fucking car
in the fucking airport parking.

01:23:56.022 --> 01:23:58.148
Ciao.

01:23:58.233 --> 01:23:59.900
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

01:24:10.286 --> 01:24:12.621
- Yes?
- You there yet?

01:24:12.705 --> 01:24:15.457
- Two minutes.
- Okay, you meet him at the bar.

01:24:15.542 --> 01:24:17.459
They are booking us for one hour.

01:24:17.544 --> 01:24:20.254
One hour?
You bring me here for one hour?

01:24:20.338 --> 01:24:22.673
Relax. Do the job good,

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:24.007
he will stay longer.

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:44.611
Okay.

01:24:52.704 --> 01:24:54.538
- Bianka?
- Yes.

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:57.749
Yes.

01:24:57.834 --> 01:24:59.585
I am Sergei.

01:24:59.669 --> 01:25:01.795
You are meeting with my boss today.

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:12.014
Open it.

01:26:38.017 --> 01:26:39.476
You okay?

01:26:40.603 --> 01:26:42.521
Da. Thank you.

01:26:42.605 --> 01:26:44.147
No, you're not.

01:26:45.692 --> 01:26:47.818
You're not okay.

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:50.070
Okay, I'm not okay, but it's okay.

01:27:26.733 --> 01:27:28.483
Close the door.

01:27:28.568 --> 01:27:30.027
Thank you.

01:27:30.903 --> 01:27:32.863
It's so cold.

01:27:32.947 --> 01:27:34.448
Yes.

01:27:36.242 --> 01:27:37.743
Where are you from?

01:27:39.078 --> 01:27:41.038
I am from Russia.

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:43.040
- Russia?
- Yeah.

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:45.125
I'm from Slovakia.

01:27:57.513 --> 01:27:59.306
Nice car.

01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:01.141
- Auto?
- Auto, yeah.

01:28:01.225 --> 01:28:03.143
Thank you.

01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:05.187
But it's not mine.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.522
Your boss's?

01:28:07.732 --> 01:28:09.274
Yes.

01:28:11.444 --> 01:28:13.487
Must be important.

01:28:16.199 --> 01:28:17.491
What does he do?

01:28:19.744 --> 01:28:21.453
Business.

01:28:21.537 --> 01:28:24.039
What kind of business?

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:28.043
Business.

01:28:32.548 --> 01:28:36.218
Well, at least
the atmosphere is yours.

01:28:38.096 --> 01:28:40.222
The atmosphere.

01:28:42.975 --> 01:28:45.310
It's a nice place to be.

01:28:48.106 --> 01:28:49.564
That's a compliment.

01:28:56.656 --> 01:28:58.573
So many buttons.

01:29:01.077 --> 01:29:03.662
Yeah, this is interesting.

01:29:08.167 --> 01:29:10.001
So perfect.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.297
Go for a drive?

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.468
Just once around the Ring?

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:20.303
- Ring?
- Ring.

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:22.848
Ring... You know...
You don't know "Ring"?

01:29:22.932 --> 01:29:24.349
What is this Ring?

01:29:24.434 --> 01:29:27.394
Ring is the most famous
street in this city.

01:29:27.478 --> 01:29:28.979
It's a circle.

01:29:37.321 --> 01:29:38.780
Come on.

01:29:40.199 --> 01:29:42.200
Okay, let's try.

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:44.161
Let's try.

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:58.383
I've never been
in anything like this.

01:29:58.676 --> 01:30:00.343
Really?

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:03.847
Why do some people
have these nice things

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:05.640
and others don't?

01:30:05.725 --> 01:30:07.267
I don't know.

01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:10.228
But I'm afraid
it doesn't make them happy.

01:30:12.482 --> 01:30:14.316
It would make me happy.

01:30:17.069 --> 01:30:18.445
Maybe, maybe.

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:22.199
I'm Anna.

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:23.408
I'm Sergei.

01:30:26.662 --> 01:30:28.830
- "Nice to meet you."
- Yes.

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:35.629
- So you're a driver?
- Yes, I'm a driver...

01:30:37.215 --> 01:30:38.632
and bodyguard.

01:30:40.968 --> 01:30:42.052
What?

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:43.220
- Dog.
- Dog?

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:47.974
Dog, yes. I must be dog
because this is how my boss treats me.

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:50.268
It's not a joke.

01:30:51.062 --> 01:30:52.729
Sorry.

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:54.481
No problem.

01:30:54.565 --> 01:30:56.858
So why don't you leave?

01:30:56.943 --> 01:30:58.610
I will.

01:30:58.694 --> 01:31:01.154
I will soon.

01:31:01.364 --> 01:31:03.365
Maybe start again, a new life.

01:31:03.449 --> 01:31:05.408
- New life?
- New life, yes.

01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:06.701
Nice.

01:31:22.093 --> 01:31:23.927
So many books.

01:31:25.596 --> 01:31:27.514
Yes! All yours?

01:31:27.598 --> 01:31:29.224
Yes.

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:33.603
My boss doesn't read.

01:31:34.272 --> 01:31:36.106
He doesn't need to.

01:31:38.317 --> 01:31:40.110
Reading is for dreamer...

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:41.903
poor dreamers.

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:44.281
Do you read?

01:31:44.365 --> 01:31:45.907
All the time.

01:31:47.076 --> 01:31:48.201
Good.

01:31:50.246 --> 01:31:52.706
Poor dreamer.

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:07.387
Come on. Come on, sugar.

01:32:46.344 --> 01:32:47.677
Bianka.

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:50.096
Bianka.

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:56.978
Bianka.

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:19.102
Hello.

01:34:19.895 --> 01:34:22.689
I want some tea on room 823.

01:35:31.008 --> 01:35:34.052
That's it.
We've come full circle.

01:35:34.136 --> 01:35:37.222
Pity. I enjoyed it.

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.184
Me too.

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.898
It was nice meeting you.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.776
You too.

01:36:03.666 --> 01:36:05.750
You're not going to answer it?

01:36:12.925 --> 01:36:14.384
Goodbye.

01:36:17.513 --> 01:36:19.430
Goodbye.

01:36:19.515 --> 01:36:21.349
Goodbye.

01:36:57.970 --> 01:37:00.471
Hello?

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:41.512
Excuse me.

01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:44.641
Thank you.

01:37:57.112 --> 01:37:59.989
- Which floor?
- Eight.

01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:13.878
Flu, always goes to my lungs.

01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:22.595
Have a good day.

01:40:02.946 --> 01:40:04.947
Hi.

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:06.699
Hi.

01:40:06.784 --> 01:40:08.701
- Hi again.
- Hi.

01:40:11.914 --> 01:40:14.123
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:15.792
Come.

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:17.460
I can't.
I'm waiting for my sister.

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:19.128
Let's go, come on.

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:20.171
To do what?

01:40:21.465 --> 01:40:23.091
I don't know.

01:40:23.175 --> 01:40:25.259
When are you coming back?

01:40:25.344 --> 01:40:26.469
I don't know.

01:40:26.553 --> 01:40:29.305
- You don't know that either?
- No. Come on.

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:31.766
- I can't.
- Come on, let's go.

01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:33.309
Come on.

01:40:37.064 --> 01:40:39.107
Come on.

01:40:39.191 --> 01:40:40.983
Okay.

01:40:59.128 --> 01:41:02.255
"After what happened,
I can't stay in your house."

01:41:03.841 --> 01:41:05.842
- House, house, house.
- House is...

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.510
- Yes, yes.
- The same in Slovak.

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:55.910
So did you settle whatever you
needed to settle back home?

01:42:55.994 --> 01:42:57.745
I'm sorry?

01:42:57.829 --> 01:42:59.872
There must have been
something the matter

01:42:59.957 --> 01:43:02.917
or else you wouldn't have wanted
to see Bianka in the first place, right?

01:43:03.001 --> 01:43:04.335
Yes.

01:43:04.419 --> 01:43:05.920
And yes.

01:43:06.922 --> 01:43:10.049
God, it's brutal...
marriage, just brutal.

01:43:10.133 --> 01:43:12.218
That's why I won't
have anything to do with it.

01:43:12.302 --> 01:43:14.428
Like religion... all that cruelty
in the name of kindness.

01:43:14.513 --> 01:43:17.932
I don't share that point of view.
I'm hopeful.

01:43:18.016 --> 01:43:19.392
Or I'm stupid.

01:43:20.435 --> 01:43:22.478
Or I'm still in love.

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:24.063
This is my wife.

01:43:24.147 --> 01:43:25.940
She's been in an art gallery,

01:43:26.024 --> 01:43:28.568
and spending too much
on our daughter.

01:43:29.987 --> 01:43:31.737
And this is Peter. Rose.

01:43:31.822 --> 01:43:33.322
- Hello. How do you do?
- Very nice to meet you.

01:43:33.407 --> 01:43:35.575
Darling, we have to go
to the airport. We're late.

01:43:35.659 --> 01:43:38.786
- I'll be in touch with you about the contacts.
- Absolutely.

01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:43.249
- So spending money?
- Oh, I just bought some kids' clothes.

01:43:44.793 --> 01:43:46.002
Taxi.

01:44:16.533 --> 01:44:19.118
A drink? No.

01:44:21.747 --> 01:44:24.498
I don't need a drink to relax.
