WEBVTT

00:06.049 --> 00:07.974
<i>Previously on Masters Of Sex...</i>

00:08.007 --> 00:09.899
I said that we'd be friends.

00:09.933 --> 00:10.743
You're kicking me out.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.094
Tell you what?

00:12.129 --> 00:13.412
That I don't like being
dragged out here in the cold

00:13.446 --> 00:14.898
when you're drunk
and insulting?!

00:14.932 --> 00:18.512
Why would I insult you
when you're all I think about?

00:18.546 --> 00:20.133
The flowers were an apology,

00:20.168 --> 00:22.294
as was my letter,
my phone calls--

00:22.330 --> 00:23.815
Stay away from me.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.031
I mean it.

00:25.065 --> 00:27.496
The truth is
Virginia's the one missing out.

00:27.531 --> 00:29.320
I'm perfect for her.

00:29.355 --> 00:30.908
And I'm not going to be
on the market long.

00:30.942 --> 00:32.799
You didn't want to get married?

00:32.834 --> 00:35.399
Are we talking
about my husbands again?

00:35.435 --> 00:36.245
So there's more than one?

00:36.279 --> 00:37.865
I can't conduct my research

00:37.901 --> 00:38.879
in a brothel.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.466
And this study will suffocate.

00:40.501 --> 00:43.000
Dear, God.
You are a dog with a bone.

00:43.034 --> 00:45.904
You know, I met
a young man at the brothel,

00:45.939 --> 00:47.424
a prostitute, a homosexual.

00:47.459 --> 00:51.240
The men who pay to see him,
they're salesmen or lawyers

00:51.276 --> 00:53.842
or a provost
of a major university.

00:53.876 --> 00:56.341
I'm begging you to reconsider.

00:56.376 --> 00:58.773
What the hell is this, Bill?

00:58.808 --> 01:01.138
Two years, and nothing.

01:01.172 --> 01:03.333
Why can't I have a baby?

01:03.368 --> 01:05.663
My wife is coming in next week.

01:05.698 --> 01:08.163
I've decided she'll join
my cervical cap trial.

01:08.197 --> 01:12.790
Bill thinks that
he can do everything by himself.

01:12.825 --> 01:16.675
But technically, I'm the one
who got his wife pregnant.

01:22.451 --> 01:24.375
It's been a good day.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.604 --> 01:37.907
Do we both orgasm?

01:37.941 --> 01:40.643
Yes.

01:40.677 --> 01:45.414
Not always at the same time.

01:45.448 --> 01:49.585
But sure. Climaxing's
not a problem for her.

01:49.619 --> 01:52.588
And do you two
rely on the same positions

01:52.622 --> 01:53.856
again and again?

01:53.890 --> 01:57.159
She likes to mix it up
position-wise.

01:57.194 --> 02:00.095
But we usually start off
the same way,

02:00.130 --> 02:02.064
with, um...

02:02.098 --> 02:03.566
with me going down on her,

02:03.600 --> 02:07.069
and me warming her up.

02:07.103 --> 02:11.207
She's, uh-- she's not shy.

02:11.241 --> 02:14.076
She tells me how fast to go,

02:14.110 --> 02:19.548
how long to stay
in a certain spot.

02:19.583 --> 02:21.483
Is this the kind of stuff
you want to hear?

02:25.500 --> 02:29.817
_

02:32.662 --> 02:35.764
Tonight, you will be
participating in a medical study

02:35.798 --> 02:38.367
that examines the physiology
of sexual response

02:38.401 --> 02:40.035
during automanipulation.

02:40.069 --> 02:42.871
Essentially, what happens
to the body during masturbation.

02:42.906 --> 02:45.841
You'll be asked to identify
yourself by name only once,

02:45.875 --> 02:48.577
after which time,
your identity will be encrypted.

02:48.611 --> 02:51.980
A record connecting
your name with your code number

02:52.015 --> 02:53.815
will be maintained
in a secure location

02:53.850 --> 02:56.285
that is separate from
the data files in the archive.

02:56.319 --> 02:59.688
It will not be possible
to identify you personally

02:59.722 --> 03:01.990
from the information you provide
for this study.

03:02.025 --> 03:04.293
At this point,
we will interview you

03:04.327 --> 03:05.494
and record your responses.

03:05.528 --> 03:07.262
You may find
the questions intimate.

03:07.297 --> 03:09.665
Please answer
as candidly as possible.

03:09.699 --> 03:11.333
Once we have
a good understanding

03:11.367 --> 03:12.434
of your sexual history,

03:12.468 --> 03:13.902
you'll be taken
into an examining room

03:13.937 --> 03:17.239
where Dr. masters will give you
a general-health assessment.

03:17.273 --> 03:19.575
Following that,
we will introduce you

03:19.609 --> 03:21.810
to the equipment that will
monitor your physical responses

03:21.844 --> 03:24.146
Then we will ask you to disrobe.

03:24.180 --> 03:27.149
And we will place electrodes
on certain parts of your body.

03:27.183 --> 03:28.717
You will be provided

03:28.751 --> 03:30.819
with whatever stimulation
you may require.

03:30.853 --> 03:32.788
And then we will ask you to...

03:36.192 --> 03:38.126
Begin.

03:38.161 --> 03:39.761
Shall we get started?

03:39.796 --> 03:41.597
Thank you for coming.

03:57.413 --> 03:59.915
Pam?

04:01.317 --> 04:03.218
I'm afraid I had to kill her.

04:04.654 --> 04:07.289
George. You scared me.

04:07.323 --> 04:09.891
I let her go early
and made dinner for the kids.

04:09.926 --> 04:11.793
Mm, I see. Cereal.

04:11.828 --> 04:13.262
Well, spaghetti--

04:13.296 --> 04:15.230
or a failed attempt
at spaghetti.

04:15.265 --> 04:18.300
Cereal was the fallback.

04:18.334 --> 04:19.668
What's this?

04:19.702 --> 04:21.403
Nothing. Work.

04:21.437 --> 04:22.771
Oh, didn't you
have a gig somewhere?

04:22.805 --> 04:24.506
Yeah, Cleveland.
I just got back.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.508
Well, do they pay you in cash?
Because I could really use--

04:26.542 --> 04:28.844
No, it got canceled, actually.

04:28.878 --> 04:30.579
Macelli's Imperial Dance Hall

04:30.613 --> 04:32.748
burnt to the ground
last Saturday.

04:32.782 --> 04:35.751
We showed up for work
to a smoking pile of rubble.

04:35.785 --> 04:38.220
I'm out two hotel rooms,
four bus fares,

04:38.254 --> 04:40.922
and 20% of the door.

04:40.957 --> 04:42.891
Hey, have you eaten yet?

04:42.925 --> 04:44.893
I can make you a plate.

04:46.629 --> 04:48.930
You would make
a terrible wife...

04:48.965 --> 04:50.999
although I'm one to talk,
right?

04:51.034 --> 04:52.834
George, I have two hours
of reading left to do.

04:52.869 --> 04:55.404
Come on! It's 10:00.

04:55.438 --> 04:57.939
Seems these days,
all you do is work.

04:57.974 --> 04:59.675
What's happened to you, Gin?

04:59.709 --> 05:01.209
I grew up.

05:01.244 --> 05:02.277
And just so you know,

05:02.312 --> 05:03.445
the kids are not allowed

05:03.479 --> 05:05.380
to watch television
on school nights.

05:05.415 --> 05:06.882
You have too many rules.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.051
And you don't have any.

05:09.085 --> 05:11.320
Well, you used to like
breaking rules with me.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.922
George.

05:13.956 --> 05:15.357
You remember in Miami

05:15.391 --> 05:17.259
when we got tossed out
of that hotel

05:17.293 --> 05:19.227
'cause you were making
all that noise.

05:19.262 --> 05:21.430
I was not making
as much noise as you were.

05:26.436 --> 05:27.769
I miss your noises.

05:27.804 --> 05:31.440
George, please.
Come on.

05:31.474 --> 05:33.675
Don't stop, baby.

05:35.645 --> 05:38.113
Yes. Yes.

05:38.147 --> 05:41.717
You are not sleeping over.

05:48.324 --> 05:49.524
Don't stop.

05:49.559 --> 05:52.227
Yes. Yes.

05:52.261 --> 05:55.263
Oh, yes. Yes.

06:03.039 --> 06:06.475
- <i># By the dawn's early light #</i>
- Bill?

06:06.509 --> 06:11.012
<i># what so proudly we hailed #</i>

06:19.188 --> 06:23.225
<i># through the perilous fight #</i>

06:23.259 --> 06:26.928
<i>- # o'er the ramparts we watched #</i>
- Bill?

06:32.435 --> 06:33.435
Bill!

06:40.777 --> 06:43.211
I used to sleepwalk
a lot as a child.

06:43.246 --> 06:48.049
One morning, my father, uh,
went to get the paper

06:48.084 --> 06:50.085
and found me sitting behind
the wheel of his Plymouth,

06:50.119 --> 06:53.188
fast asleep,
my hands on the wheel.

06:53.222 --> 06:56.091
But that was
years and years ago.

06:56.125 --> 06:59.861
And you weren't aware
that you were doing any of it?

06:59.896 --> 07:03.799
Didn't hear the racket?

07:03.833 --> 07:05.133
I'm sure our neighbors did.

07:05.168 --> 07:07.736
Well, I'm sorry
to-- to have scared you.

07:10.006 --> 07:11.306
Do you think
it might have been triggered

07:11.340 --> 07:14.609
by anxiety... about the baby?

07:14.644 --> 07:16.778
No, of course not.

07:16.813 --> 07:19.247
Let's get back to bed--
big day tomorrow,

07:19.282 --> 07:22.384
which could be an altogether
different kind of nightmare.

07:22.418 --> 07:23.518
Oh, stop.

07:23.553 --> 07:25.954
She's only gonna be here
for a week.

07:25.988 --> 07:26.988
We rarely see her.

07:27.023 --> 07:28.924
You can endure her
for seven days.

07:28.958 --> 07:32.461
Yeah. I'm sorry it's gonna
fall to you to keep her entertained.

07:32.495 --> 07:33.628
It's fine.

07:33.663 --> 07:36.198
I'm happy for the distraction,
actually.

07:36.232 --> 07:38.900
Besides, she says
that all she wants to do

07:38.935 --> 07:41.169
is spend time
with her grandchild,

07:41.204 --> 07:45.273
which doesn't involve much more
than this.

07:45.308 --> 07:46.508
Hmm?

07:46.542 --> 07:49.411
Well, just so long
as you're prepared

07:49.445 --> 07:51.179
to do a lot of caretaking.

07:51.214 --> 07:54.449
The woman is helpless.
She can't make a decision.

07:54.484 --> 07:57.419
She can't read a train schedule,
can't balance a checkbook.

07:57.453 --> 07:59.621
Sweetheart, in four months,
we're gonna have another visitor

07:59.655 --> 08:02.023
who needs everything
done for him.

08:02.058 --> 08:03.892
Maybe we should look
at this time with your mother

08:03.926 --> 08:05.193
as a dress rehearsal.

08:09.398 --> 08:14.402
We ate all
the sugar snacks last night.

08:14.437 --> 08:17.639
Could you make us pancakes?

08:17.673 --> 08:19.574
Sure thing, buddy.

08:21.177 --> 08:23.545
You and daddy had a sleepover?

08:23.579 --> 08:25.947
Yes, daddy slept over.
He slept.

08:25.982 --> 08:27.916
He collapsed the second
his head hit the pillow.

08:27.950 --> 08:29.918
Henry, can you go
wake up your sister?

08:29.952 --> 08:32.386
The bus leaves in--
it leaves in 20 minutes.

08:32.421 --> 08:36.758
Sweetie, can you go wake her up,
please?

08:39.761 --> 08:41.730
What the hell
are you still doing here?

08:41.764 --> 08:43.398
I told you
that you could not stay over!

08:43.432 --> 08:44.699
What's the big deal, Gin?

08:44.734 --> 08:46.368
The big deal
is that he's going to think

08:46.402 --> 08:47.702
that his parents
have gotten back together.

08:47.737 --> 08:52.440
George, just say goodbye
to the kids and go home.

08:52.475 --> 08:54.142
Yeah, well...

08:54.176 --> 08:59.214
I can't exactly... go home.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.316
Desalvo changed
the locks on me.

09:01.350 --> 09:04.853
I'm three months behind
on my rent.

09:10.192 --> 09:13.628
Baby, I am this close
to having the car repossessed,

09:13.663 --> 09:15.096
I mean, I had to hock
that old drum kit

09:15.131 --> 09:16.932
that I was gonna teach Henry
how to play.

09:16.966 --> 09:18.733
Did you know
that you had been locked out

09:18.768 --> 09:19.834
when you came here last night?

09:19.869 --> 09:22.604
I thought
I'd sleep on the couch.

09:22.638 --> 09:23.805
Oh.

09:23.839 --> 09:28.310
Can you-- can you spot me
anything, Gin?

09:28.344 --> 09:29.978
I'm living out of a suitcase.

09:30.012 --> 09:33.181
I've been turning my underwear
inside out since Thursday.

09:33.215 --> 09:36.284
Well, I have been
working 16 hours a day,

09:36.319 --> 09:39.054
and I can barely afford
to pay for a babysitter.

09:39.088 --> 09:41.923
Well, why don't <i>I</i> watch
the kids for a couple of weeks?

09:41.958 --> 09:44.459
You can pay me slightly less
than you pay your girl.

09:44.493 --> 09:46.328
I am not paying you

09:46.362 --> 09:50.365
to babysit your own children,
George Johnson!

09:50.399 --> 09:51.900
It's win-win.

09:54.971 --> 09:57.505
You look
as if you've seen a ghost!

09:57.540 --> 09:58.940
Mother, I--

09:58.975 --> 10:01.676
Libby said you weren't due in
till 10:00.

10:01.711 --> 10:02.677
God, did I make a mistake?

10:02.712 --> 10:04.312
No, darling, no.

10:04.347 --> 10:06.781
My sister got me to the airport
very early.

10:06.816 --> 10:08.183
And Darlene
sends her love to you.

10:08.217 --> 10:11.886
And I saw that there was a 7:00
leaving for St. Louis,

10:11.921 --> 10:13.388
so I just... hopped on it.

10:13.422 --> 10:15.523
Uh...

10:15.558 --> 10:18.326
There. Thank you.

10:18.361 --> 10:20.562
Oh, my goodness!

10:20.596 --> 10:21.796
Look at you!

10:22.865 --> 10:24.165
You are glowing!

10:24.200 --> 10:25.400
Oh, you think so?

10:25.434 --> 10:27.936
Let me see.
Turn sideways.

10:27.970 --> 10:30.572
There's no hiding that.

10:30.606 --> 10:34.843
Oh, I'm so excited for you.

10:34.877 --> 10:36.645
For both of you.

10:36.679 --> 10:40.682
I know what you're thinking,
Billy-- red.

10:40.716 --> 10:43.251
Well, I've decided
to wear more color.

10:43.285 --> 10:45.186
Four years in black is enough.

10:45.221 --> 10:49.290
And I'm sure your father
would understand.

10:49.325 --> 10:52.160
Now, Libby, you must show me
what you're planning

10:52.194 --> 10:54.362
in the nursery,
because I have some ideas.

10:56.532 --> 10:57.999
Oh.

10:58.034 --> 11:01.002
My goodness.

11:04.040 --> 11:07.142
Marjorie, how've you been?

11:07.176 --> 11:10.979
Fine. You?
Stand anyone up lately?

11:11.013 --> 11:12.180
Uh...

11:12.214 --> 11:14.916
I-I thought I explained
what happened. Um...

11:14.950 --> 11:17.786
Yes, well,
that endometrial ablation

11:17.820 --> 11:19.287
that you had to perform--

11:19.321 --> 11:21.423
I checked
the surgical schedule.

11:21.457 --> 11:24.559
They were re-laying linoleum
in the OR that night.

11:27.997 --> 11:29.597
So I guess
I'm not the only one who knows

11:29.632 --> 11:31.933
how you like your eggs
in the morning.

11:31.967 --> 11:34.469
Hello, Selma.

11:34.503 --> 11:36.371
Velma.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.307
It's Velma. With a "V."

11:39.341 --> 11:42.544
I meant to call. I--

11:42.578 --> 11:44.713
And I meant
to put that on your plate.

11:52.655 --> 11:56.057
What a heartbreaker
you are, Dr. Haas.

11:56.092 --> 11:58.860
Don't you have that backwards?

12:16.512 --> 12:17.479
Hi.

12:17.513 --> 12:20.882
Hi. Remember me?

12:22.818 --> 12:24.285
Sure. Sure, I do.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.221
It's okay.

12:26.255 --> 12:28.490
It was a long time ago.
I'd just turned 16.

12:30.192 --> 12:32.627
16?

12:32.661 --> 12:34.129
Did I know you were 16?

12:34.163 --> 12:35.997
Well, sure you did.

12:36.031 --> 12:38.066
You were at my birthday party.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.400
Daddy invited you.

12:39.435 --> 12:41.736
The band was playing
"Embraceable You,"

12:41.771 --> 12:45.073
and I screwed up my courage
and asked you to dance.

12:45.107 --> 12:47.909
You dipped me,
like they do in the movies.

12:47.943 --> 12:49.878
You are
Provost Scully's daughter.

12:49.912 --> 12:52.680
Vivian.

12:52.715 --> 12:55.283
I'm in college now.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.252
Daddy said
if I did some volunteering

12:57.286 --> 12:58.987
at the hospital,
he'd buy me a car.

12:59.021 --> 13:00.989
So that was one good reason.

13:03.025 --> 13:05.627
Want to maybe guess
the other reason?

13:07.763 --> 13:11.332
I'll be 19 very soon.

13:14.537 --> 13:17.172
Well, if it's a girl, Michella.

13:17.206 --> 13:19.407
If it's a boy,
Nicholas-- after my father.

13:19.441 --> 13:23.077
Ah. I see you
still working in the laundry.

13:23.112 --> 13:25.246
How much longer
do you intend to come in?

13:25.281 --> 13:28.116
My doctor says I can
work right up until the baby--

13:28.150 --> 13:31.119
my doctor before.

13:31.153 --> 13:32.153
He is nice man,

13:32.188 --> 13:34.355
but he doesn't understand
what I tell him,

13:34.390 --> 13:36.958
that this is my last baby.

13:36.992 --> 13:39.394
Is it another cesarean
you're worried about?

13:39.428 --> 13:41.663
- Because a lot of women--
- No, it's not.

13:41.697 --> 13:45.166
I cannot afford another child.

13:46.836 --> 13:48.403
I see. This is your...

13:48.437 --> 13:50.004
Second.

13:50.039 --> 13:53.341
I have a son, Daniel.
He is eight years.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.410
I know there is an operation.

13:55.444 --> 13:58.847
And I know you could fix me
after the baby comes

13:58.881 --> 14:00.148
so there are no more.

14:00.182 --> 14:02.784
Well, there are
less permanent ways

14:02.818 --> 14:04.018
to prevent a pregnancy.

14:04.053 --> 14:05.119
Contraception--

14:05.154 --> 14:08.756
My husband
won't take... steps.

14:12.361 --> 14:14.495
An elective tubal ligation

14:14.530 --> 14:16.197
requires the husband's consent

14:16.232 --> 14:18.666
before the hospital
sterilization committee

14:18.701 --> 14:20.869
will even consider
the procedure.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.271
Uh...

14:23.305 --> 14:27.008
without it,
they would never sanction it.

14:30.045 --> 14:32.747
I'm sorry, my English.

14:34.149 --> 14:36.584
I'm afraid I can't help you.

14:38.687 --> 14:43.458
Virginia? I-- Virginia?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.194
What are you doing?

14:46.228 --> 14:48.363
Nothing, sir.
Just waiting for my mother.

14:48.397 --> 14:50.531
What have you got
underneath your coat?

14:50.566 --> 14:52.500
I'm sorry, sir.

14:52.534 --> 14:55.136
I was just looking at it,
and it just broke.

14:55.170 --> 14:58.172
It's-- it's--
it's supposed to come apart.

14:58.207 --> 15:00.475
It's a teaching model.

15:00.509 --> 15:03.011
So you're not sore?

15:03.045 --> 15:05.179
W-why would I be sore?

15:05.214 --> 15:07.248
A stupid kid comes in
and messes with my stuff,

15:07.283 --> 15:10.652
I'd want to knock
some goddamn sense into him.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.861
Gini.

15:19.895 --> 15:21.462
Gini, come meet
my mother-in-law.

15:21.497 --> 15:23.398
Mother, this is
Virginia Johnson-- Bill's assistant.

15:23.432 --> 15:26.267
- Oh.
- Gini, Estabrooks Masters.

15:26.302 --> 15:27.568
- Hello.
- Essie.

15:27.603 --> 15:30.338
Libby says you are absolutely
indispensable to my son.

15:30.372 --> 15:32.206
And to me, as well.

15:32.241 --> 15:34.509
Well, we'll see how well
he fared without me this morning.

15:34.543 --> 15:35.777
I'm an hour late.

15:35.811 --> 15:36.778
Did the kids hold you up?

15:36.812 --> 15:38.012
- Gini's got two.
- Oh.

15:38.047 --> 15:40.882
No, actually,
it was my ex-husband.

15:40.916 --> 15:42.317
It's a long story.

15:42.351 --> 15:44.352
Oh.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.522
Well, in my opinion,

15:47.556 --> 15:49.424
you have to draw the line
with him.

15:49.458 --> 15:52.760
You know how he would get
the message loud and clear?

15:52.795 --> 15:54.262
If you started seeing
someone else.

15:54.296 --> 15:55.530
Uh-huh.

15:55.564 --> 15:57.799
Any particular someone
you have in mind, Libby?

15:57.833 --> 16:00.400
There are a few avenues
that I'm scoring.

16:00.569 --> 16:03.037
What are you
doing here, mother?

16:03.072 --> 16:04.739
Oh, hello, dear.

16:04.773 --> 16:07.775
I was hoping you might
give me the five-cent tour

16:07.810 --> 16:10.044
while Libby is having
her checkup.

16:10.079 --> 16:12.513
I have a--
a very full schedule.

16:12.548 --> 16:15.049
Why don't I see if I
can shuffle some things around?

16:15.084 --> 16:16.351
You're late, Virginia.

16:16.385 --> 16:19.120
I had a 9:00, and you were
nowhere to be found.

16:19.154 --> 16:20.688
Well, that was
her ex-husband's fault.

16:20.723 --> 16:25.460
He spent the night, and she couldn't
get him out the door this morning.

16:25.494 --> 16:28.029
On the sofa.

16:28.063 --> 16:29.530
He spent the night on the sofa.

16:29.565 --> 16:31.165
He's having
some financial issues.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.001
Well, is that gonna
continue to be a problem?

16:33.035 --> 16:34.702
No. No.

16:34.737 --> 16:36.637
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

16:39.074 --> 16:40.541
Will you excuse me?

16:40.576 --> 16:42.944
You're not gonna
show me your--

16:42.978 --> 16:44.112
Billy?

16:44.146 --> 16:45.747
W-why don't I show you
Bill's office?

16:45.781 --> 16:48.249
Ugh. It's a shame
I didn't see the place sooner.

16:48.283 --> 16:51.252
But you know, my husband
so hated hospitals.

16:53.922 --> 16:55.356
Mrs. Zelinksy.

16:55.391 --> 16:57.859
Oh, you met my boy.

16:57.893 --> 17:03.031
When you said
you couldn't afford...

17:03.065 --> 17:06.666
another child,

17:06.702 --> 17:10.438
it had nothing to do with money,
did it?

17:14.910 --> 17:17.878
Why don't you leave?

17:17.913 --> 17:20.982
And go where?

17:21.016 --> 17:25.953
There is only his brother,
and it's the same there.

17:25.988 --> 17:31.759
There is no one
to make it better except you.

17:31.794 --> 17:34.562
One day, maybe, with two babies,
I could leave.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.664
But with three or four, Doctor?

17:36.698 --> 17:40.334
I'd have to stay forever.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.907
11 pounds.

17:45.941 --> 17:50.011
Oh?
My bathroom scale said 16.

17:50.045 --> 17:51.212
Let me guess.

17:51.246 --> 17:53.081
You're one of those women
who adjusts her scale

17:53.115 --> 17:55.183
to read five pounds heavier
in order to trick herself

17:55.217 --> 17:56.317
into losing weight.

17:56.351 --> 17:59.087
How well you know women.

17:59.121 --> 18:02.690
Oh, believe me,

18:02.724 --> 18:06.094
a few of them
are total mysteries,

18:06.128 --> 18:08.362
which is why I am
swearing off them for awhile.

18:08.397 --> 18:09.530
Oh, please.

18:09.565 --> 18:12.467
You're the most eligible
bachelor in St. Louis.

18:12.501 --> 18:13.601
I could find you

18:13.635 --> 18:15.803
the perfect girl
in five minutes.

18:15.838 --> 18:18.172
I already found her.

18:18.207 --> 18:20.741
Problem is she broke my heart.

18:20.776 --> 18:22.610
20 centimeters.

18:22.644 --> 18:26.347
That is right on track
for 22 weeks.

18:26.381 --> 18:30.651
Ethan, you have to be
open to meeting someone new.

18:30.686 --> 18:32.186
If this girl threw you back,

18:32.221 --> 18:33.821
then she wasn't
the right one for you.

18:33.856 --> 18:36.190
Oh, but she was.

18:39.962 --> 18:44.799
You know how
in that "Wizard Of Oz" movie--

18:44.833 --> 18:46.067
- that girl, Dorothy?
Mm-hmm.

18:46.101 --> 18:48.269
How she goes
on this amazing adventure

18:48.303 --> 18:50.371
that's all in
glorious technicolor, right?

18:50.405 --> 18:52.273
And then she ends up
back on the farm

18:52.307 --> 18:53.541
in boring black and white.

18:53.575 --> 18:55.710
That's how it was
with this woman.

18:55.744 --> 18:59.313
Before her, I knew exactly
how my life was going to go.

18:59.348 --> 19:02.250
And then I met her,
and suddenly I could see

19:02.284 --> 19:04.952
a totally different future
for myself.

19:06.755 --> 19:08.990
In color.

19:12.828 --> 19:15.263
Once you've seen Oz,
who wants to go back to Kansas?

19:22.938 --> 19:24.705
- How many tonight?
- Three.

19:24.740 --> 19:27.875
First one may be a no-show.

19:27.910 --> 19:29.443
It's just a feeling.

19:29.478 --> 19:32.046
He sounded strange
on the phone.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.182
I'll go check
to see if anybody's here.

19:37.252 --> 19:38.853
Am I in the right place?

19:38.887 --> 19:40.621
I'm here for the study.

19:40.656 --> 19:42.857
Well? Anyone?

19:42.891 --> 19:44.625
- Yeah. You ready for me?
- Absolutely.

19:44.660 --> 19:46.928
Uh, I'm Dr. Masters.
This is Mrs. Johnson.

19:46.962 --> 19:48.129
Walter McAddy.

19:48.163 --> 19:50.464
Nice to meet you.

19:50.499 --> 19:51.799
Walter McAddy.

19:51.833 --> 19:53.267
I saw your flyer.

19:53.302 --> 19:54.569
Looking forward
to helping you two out tonight.

19:54.603 --> 19:57.638
Good. Take a seat.
Let's get started.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.547
What we'll be doing

20:06.582 --> 20:09.283
is measuring
your genital reaction,

20:09.318 --> 20:11.252
both intra-and extra-genital,

20:11.286 --> 20:12.853
to sexual self-stimulation.

20:12.888 --> 20:15.122
Now, initially,

20:15.157 --> 20:17.425
you may be uncomfortable
being observed.

20:17.459 --> 20:20.094
It takes some getting used to,

20:20.128 --> 20:21.629
but people generally do.

20:21.663 --> 20:23.197
We will be interrupting
you occasionally

20:23.232 --> 20:24.632
to take some measurements.

20:24.666 --> 20:26.334
And what we can't observe,

20:26.368 --> 20:28.669
these machines
will help us to monitor...

20:28.704 --> 20:30.004
...your pulse,
your blood pressure...

20:30.038 --> 20:32.039
...your perspiration,
your breathing.

20:32.074 --> 20:34.308
We will need you
to remove your clothes...

20:34.343 --> 20:36.377
- ...your panties...
- ...your socks.

20:36.411 --> 20:38.045
Sir, your hat.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.413
We're going to apply
these sensors to your skin.

20:39.448 --> 20:42.116
- The goal is to relax...
- ...lie back...

20:42.150 --> 20:44.151
...touch yourself how you
generally do when you're alone.

20:56.398 --> 20:58.366
Phase one.

21:05.874 --> 21:09.543
Areolae
at 4.5 centimeters.

21:11.947 --> 21:14.915
Tensing and thickening
of integument.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.319
Phallus at 9.6 centimeters.

21:22.891 --> 21:25.126
Maculopapular rash
on epigastrium.

21:28.063 --> 21:30.231
Moving into plateau phase.

21:33.235 --> 21:34.969
138 BPMs.

21:39.841 --> 21:42.343
175.

21:42.377 --> 21:43.744
Turgidity of nipples.

21:43.779 --> 21:45.680
Color change in coronal area.

21:48.183 --> 21:49.383
Hyperventilation.

21:49.418 --> 21:50.751
Testicular enlargement.

21:50.786 --> 21:52.520
- Stop.
- What?

21:52.554 --> 21:54.522
Mrs. Johnson needs
to get a measurement.

21:57.225 --> 21:58.993
14.9 centimeters.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.262
What's that in inches?

22:04.733 --> 22:06.167
Orgasmic phase.

22:11.440 --> 22:12.973
Withdrawal of clitoral shaft.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.679
It's okay
to close your eyes, you know.

22:26.488 --> 22:28.055
That smells good, Essie.

22:28.090 --> 22:29.857
Is that coconut?

22:29.891 --> 22:32.093
I saw the recipe in a magazine.

22:32.127 --> 22:34.228
It's called Island Chicken.

22:34.262 --> 22:36.564
There's pineapple in it, too.

22:36.598 --> 22:37.965
I put the table leaf in.

22:37.999 --> 22:39.667
Honey, can you do
the place cards?

22:39.701 --> 22:41.135
And if you bring in
the ice bucket,

22:41.169 --> 22:43.104
I'll give it a polish.

22:43.138 --> 22:46.707
If I have a little
too much to drink tonight,

22:46.742 --> 22:48.542
all I need is a little nudge
under the table.

22:48.577 --> 22:49.977
Since when do you drink?

22:50.011 --> 22:52.680
Darlene has
a cocktail with dinner,

22:52.714 --> 22:54.148
and occasionally I join her.

22:54.182 --> 22:55.282
All these years,

22:55.317 --> 22:57.051
your father only allowed
scotch in the house,

22:57.085 --> 22:59.787
which was never
to my taste, so...

22:59.821 --> 23:03.624
Have you ever had a Tom Collins?
It's delicious.

23:03.658 --> 23:06.160
We can serve them tonight.

23:06.194 --> 23:09.697
I'll see
how we're fixed for gin.

23:13.301 --> 23:15.569
I'm glad you're here.

23:15.604 --> 23:19.173
Careful, or we're never
gonna let you leave.

23:19.207 --> 23:20.708
Do you mean that?

23:22.978 --> 23:25.746
Because...

23:25.781 --> 23:28.048
I was wondering how you'd feel

23:28.083 --> 23:30.885
if I were to spend
more time here.

23:30.919 --> 23:32.119
You mean extend your visit?

23:32.154 --> 23:35.523
No, I mean
move here to St. Louis.

23:38.627 --> 23:41.429
Look at you, sweetheart.
You've gone pale.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.431
Of course I wouldn't move in
with you and Bill.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.465
I'd get my own apartment.

23:44.499 --> 23:45.533
It could be close enough

23:45.567 --> 23:47.001
so that I could help out
with the baby.

23:47.035 --> 23:50.404
Ethan? Who's Ethan?

23:50.439 --> 23:52.673
Ethan Haas, silly.

23:52.707 --> 23:54.074
You invited <i>him?</i>

23:59.915 --> 24:02.316
And Virginia?
You in-- you invited Virginia?

24:04.319 --> 24:05.653
Why, Christ, Lib,

24:05.687 --> 24:09.089
what are you doing,
setting them up?

24:09.124 --> 24:11.392
They already know each other.
They see each other every day.

24:11.426 --> 24:15.596
Yes, but that is
a professional context.

24:15.630 --> 24:19.066
She's not right for him at all.

24:19.100 --> 24:21.402
She's much older than he is.

24:21.436 --> 24:22.837
Divorced twice.

24:22.871 --> 24:24.672
A woman of the world!

24:24.706 --> 24:26.507
Some men find that
very alluring!

24:26.541 --> 24:27.875
She has two children.

24:27.909 --> 24:29.510
Yes, and she is bringing them.

24:29.544 --> 24:31.412
That way, Ethan can get
to know them casually

24:31.446 --> 24:33.180
before he and Gini get serious.

24:35.717 --> 24:37.918
Please and thank-yous, remember?

24:37.952 --> 24:40.053
- Yes.
- Napkins on laps.

24:40.088 --> 24:42.356
And if you don't like
the food--

24:42.390 --> 24:44.525
here,
if you don't like the food,

24:44.559 --> 24:46.693
- all you have you have to do--
- Virginia.

24:49.130 --> 24:50.364
What're you doing here?

24:50.398 --> 24:52.366
What do you mean?
Libby invited me.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.201
Who's he? Who are you?

24:54.235 --> 24:56.136
I'm Dr. Haas.
And who are you?

24:56.171 --> 24:57.738
I'm Henry.
She's Tessa.

24:57.772 --> 24:59.840
Dr. Haas and I
work together at the hospit--

24:59.874 --> 25:00.908
Why are you smiling?

25:00.942 --> 25:02.876
It's a fix-up.

25:02.911 --> 25:04.711
She's fixing us up.

25:04.746 --> 25:07.314
Did you put her up to this?

25:07.348 --> 25:08.549
Of course not.

25:08.583 --> 25:10.984
I-I am as surprised
as you are.

25:11.019 --> 25:12.619
Do you give shots?

25:12.654 --> 25:14.288
Well, yes. Sometimes.

25:14.322 --> 25:15.756
I don't like you.

25:15.790 --> 25:18.225
I don't like him.

25:18.259 --> 25:21.028
She's an incredibly
perceptive child.

25:21.062 --> 25:23.430
Come on. Come on.

25:27.535 --> 25:29.937
It took Caroline a
period of adjustment, of course,

25:29.971 --> 25:31.438
but now I think she sees
the value

25:31.472 --> 25:32.840
of having a set of grandparents

25:32.874 --> 25:35.175
living close by
to the little ones.

25:35.210 --> 25:36.543
How about you, Bill?

25:36.578 --> 25:39.079
The thought of your mother here
living so close by--

25:39.113 --> 25:41.014
that got you spooked?

25:41.049 --> 25:42.716
Oh, I'm not a meddler.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.651
I know how to keep
out of the way.

25:44.686 --> 25:46.353
Yeah.

25:46.387 --> 25:48.488
Look, I know
why you're mad at me.

25:48.523 --> 25:50.757
And I don't blame you.

25:50.792 --> 25:52.159
But I didn't know
about any of this.

25:52.193 --> 25:54.194
All she did
was invite me to dinner.

25:54.229 --> 25:55.929
You could have said no.

25:55.964 --> 25:57.097
Why?

25:57.131 --> 25:58.665
M-maybe I was hoping

25:58.700 --> 26:00.434
she'd introduce me
to some girl,

26:00.468 --> 26:03.003
someone who'd make me forget
about you...

26:03.037 --> 26:05.305
although, honestly, I don't know
if that's even possible.

26:05.340 --> 26:07.374
Don't get sloppy, Ethan.

26:07.408 --> 26:08.508
Henry, tell us,

26:08.543 --> 26:09.776
what is your favorite subject
in school?

26:09.811 --> 26:12.379
PE.

26:12.413 --> 26:15.349
That's not really
a subject, now, is it?

26:20.321 --> 26:21.355
Essie.

26:21.389 --> 26:22.589
What can you tell us

26:22.624 --> 26:24.024
about Bill
when he was a little boy?

26:24.058 --> 26:25.525
Oh, yes. Please.

26:28.630 --> 26:31.064
Has he told you about
his campaign for long pants?

26:31.099 --> 26:32.666
Oh, for goodness' sake, mother.

26:32.700 --> 26:35.202
Well, he begged us for months,

26:35.236 --> 26:36.703
and I told him, I said, "Billy,

26:36.738 --> 26:38.839
your father's not gonna pay
for a new pair of trousers

26:38.873 --> 26:41.074
until you've outgrown
your last pair of knickers."

26:41.109 --> 26:43.710
Really, mother,
no one's interested.

26:43.745 --> 26:45.646
We are.
Aren't we, Gini?

26:45.680 --> 26:47.080
Yes.

26:47.115 --> 26:48.649
Well, he had
this one pair of knickers

26:48.683 --> 26:49.983
that were still
too big for him.

26:50.018 --> 26:53.220
So he went and got my sewing box
and a pair of scissors,

26:53.254 --> 26:59.126
and he shortened
the legs of those things.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.828
He actually hemmed them
himself,

27:01.863 --> 27:05.098
and he took in the waistline
himself.

27:05.133 --> 27:07.267
And it was as neat
as any seamstress.

27:07.302 --> 27:09.336
A surgeon even then, huh?

27:09.370 --> 27:12.506
Well, I thought
he'd had a sudden growth spurt,

27:12.540 --> 27:17.010
well, but, his father didn't,
uh, buy into that for a minute.

27:18.613 --> 27:20.681
I was made
to wear those knickers

27:20.715 --> 27:24.017
until I was 14.

27:24.052 --> 27:25.018
14.

27:29.290 --> 27:31.024
Please pass the rolls,
Marilyn, won't you?

27:33.528 --> 27:35.128
Ah,
well, I think I've had enough,

27:35.163 --> 27:37.764
and it was quite good,
if I do say so myself.

27:39.467 --> 27:43.603
<i># When Marimba rhythm</i>
<i>starts to play #</i>

27:43.638 --> 27:45.973
<i># dance with me #</i>

27:46.007 --> 27:47.874
<i># make me sway #</i>

27:47.909 --> 27:49.876
<i># like a lazy ocean</i>
<i>hugs the shore #</i>

27:49.911 --> 27:51.845
You want to take your
wife and child for a whirl?

27:51.879 --> 27:55.048
<i># Hold me close, sway me more #</i>

27:55.083 --> 27:56.249
Come join us, you two.

27:56.284 --> 27:58.819
<i># Like a flower</i>
<i>bending in the breeze #</i>

27:58.853 --> 28:01.388
<i># bend with me #</i>

28:01.422 --> 28:03.323
How 'bout it, huh?

28:03.358 --> 28:05.092
If only to make Libby happy.

28:05.126 --> 28:08.028
Byron, do you think
there'd be talk

28:08.062 --> 28:09.596
if I asked you to dance?

28:09.630 --> 28:11.732
<i># Sway with me #</i>

28:11.766 --> 28:13.133
My wife would say

28:13.167 --> 28:15.435
you're taking your life
in your hands.

28:15.470 --> 28:17.738
Well,
I'm willing to take the risk.

28:17.772 --> 28:19.272
Really, how bad could you be?

28:19.307 --> 28:23.944
<i># Only you have</i>
<i>that magic technique #</i>

28:23.978 --> 28:28.115
<i># when we sway, I go weak #</i>

28:29.317 --> 28:30.350
Oh.

28:32.453 --> 28:35.956
Wait, Byron. Byron, Byron.

28:35.990 --> 28:37.824
How about you be me,
and I'll be you?

28:37.859 --> 28:39.326
<i># You know how #</i>

28:39.360 --> 28:42.863
<i># sway me smooth, sway me now #</i>

28:42.897 --> 28:45.032
This is not your first time.

28:45.066 --> 28:47.434
Well, sometimes
you've just got to show a man

28:47.468 --> 28:48.769
how it's done.

29:06.988 --> 29:09.389
Excuse me, mister?

29:15.029 --> 29:16.229
- What did you do?
- Nothing! I'm sorry.

29:16.264 --> 29:18.231
Did you flush
something down there?

29:18.266 --> 29:20.400
- He uses too much paper.
- Shut up!

29:20.435 --> 29:22.702
He shouldn't have eaten
that coconut stuff.

29:22.737 --> 29:24.204
He's got a sensitive stomach.

29:24.238 --> 29:25.605
Shut up, Tess.

29:25.640 --> 29:26.807
Ah, shit!

29:26.841 --> 29:29.676
We're not allowed
to call it that.

29:30.945 --> 29:33.280
I'm sorry. Are you mad?

29:33.314 --> 29:35.282
No, I'm not mad.
Stop that!

29:35.316 --> 29:36.483
People wash their hands
with those!

29:36.517 --> 29:38.952
I'll take care of it.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.020
I want to help!

29:40.054 --> 29:42.022
Out.

30:01.676 --> 30:03.076
Thank you so much.

30:03.111 --> 30:06.046
Thanks again, Bill.

30:08.716 --> 30:11.551
What do you say?

30:11.586 --> 30:13.520
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

30:13.554 --> 30:15.522
And I'm sorry about the mess.

30:15.556 --> 30:18.125
Oh, don't give it
another thought. Right, Bill?

30:18.159 --> 30:19.392
These things happen.

30:19.427 --> 30:20.794
Get your coat.

30:20.828 --> 30:23.763
I'm taking off, too.

30:23.798 --> 30:26.900
Libby. Bill.

30:26.934 --> 30:29.336
You're not taking the bus, are you?

30:29.370 --> 30:31.004
I'll drive you.
It's on my way.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.405
You know her address?

30:32.440 --> 30:34.975
No, I-- just the general
vinicit-- vinci-- vincinity.

30:35.009 --> 30:36.676
That's okay.
We'll be fine.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.078
Thank you. Good night.

30:38.112 --> 30:39.412
Thank you both again.

30:39.447 --> 30:41.681
Let me understand this.

30:41.716 --> 30:44.751
You'd rather, uh, haul your two
kids on a bus at 11:00 at night

30:44.785 --> 30:46.786
than have <i>me</i> drive you home?

30:46.821 --> 30:48.188
I'll drive you home.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.623
Come on. That's stupid.
Bill, it's on my way.

30:49.657 --> 30:51.825
- You know--
- I said I'm driving her home.

30:51.859 --> 30:53.193
I'll need to take the Cadillac.

30:53.227 --> 30:57.330
Um, the keys are in my purse.

30:57.365 --> 30:58.532
Maybe you should have

30:58.566 --> 31:00.867
another cup of coffee
before you go, Ethan.

31:02.803 --> 31:05.305
Hey, you know what, Virginia?

31:05.339 --> 31:07.307
Fuck you.

31:21.455 --> 31:23.290
It's okay.

31:23.324 --> 31:27.060
Libby means well.

31:27.094 --> 31:31.765
She just wants everyone
to be as happy as she is...

31:31.799 --> 31:36.169
which these days
is an especially tall order.

31:36.204 --> 31:38.171
She is radiant, Bill.

31:38.206 --> 31:40.173
Yes, she is.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.075
She's going to make
a wonderful mother.

31:46.614 --> 31:49.883
Did you know you were
good at it before you had them?

31:52.820 --> 31:54.621
I don't know
that I <i>am</i> good at it.

32:08.369 --> 32:10.537
Ethan.

32:10.571 --> 32:13.940
You left this the other day,

32:13.975 --> 32:16.643
in the cafeteria.

32:16.677 --> 32:19.613
It had your address on it,
so I thought I'd bring it by.

32:24.352 --> 32:26.820
You could say "Thank you."

32:26.854 --> 32:30.624
Thanks. Sorry.

32:30.658 --> 32:32.359
I've had, um...

32:34.762 --> 32:36.963
I have had a night.

32:39.467 --> 32:41.601
Do you want to come in...

32:41.636 --> 32:43.436
Vivian.

32:43.471 --> 32:44.938
Vivian.

32:44.972 --> 32:46.172
I'd love to.

33:00.187 --> 33:01.788
Guess who's been
standing at attention

33:01.822 --> 33:04.891
ever since
the hospital last night.

33:09.063 --> 33:11.164
Look, if I'd given you
the heads up I was coming over,

33:11.198 --> 33:12.365
you would've said no.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.967
Goddamn right, I would've.

33:14.001 --> 33:16.002
That is my job.
What are you trying to do?

33:16.037 --> 33:17.170
Are you trying to get me fired?

33:17.204 --> 33:19.272
No,
I was trying to make a buck--

33:19.307 --> 33:21.041
which I did,
thank you very much.

33:21.075 --> 33:23.476
I bought some time
with my landlord.

33:23.511 --> 33:25.545
And you-- you got some
measurements for your study.

33:25.579 --> 33:27.614
So I'd say it worked out
for both of us.

33:27.648 --> 33:30.550
You honestly can't
understand how your involvement

33:30.584 --> 33:32.952
could have compromised
my standing with my boss?

33:32.987 --> 33:34.354
Because we're exes?

33:34.388 --> 33:36.122
No one's gonna know about that.

33:36.157 --> 33:37.590
And I guarantee you

33:37.625 --> 33:40.226
that every other clown in your
little study uses a fake name.

33:40.261 --> 33:41.661
That little study

33:41.696 --> 33:44.197
is keeping a roof over
your kids' heads, George.

33:44.231 --> 33:45.732
It's keeping shoes
on their feet,

33:45.766 --> 33:47.467
and it's keeping food
in the icebox!

33:47.501 --> 33:48.501
Okay.

33:48.536 --> 33:49.969
That is a hell of a lot more

33:50.004 --> 33:51.571
than I can say
for their father!

33:57.778 --> 34:00.714
Sorry it's a mess.
I'm hardly ever home.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.049
You don't have people over?

34:03.084 --> 34:04.718
- Girls?
- Sometimes.

34:04.752 --> 34:07.454
Sometimes I have girls over,
and they never notice

34:07.488 --> 34:09.789
because I don't even turn
the lights on.

34:14.695 --> 34:17.397
What do you think about that?

34:17.431 --> 34:20.934
You like it
with the lights off?

34:20.967 --> 34:23.069
On or off.

34:23.103 --> 34:25.205
Both.

34:25.239 --> 34:28.908
You?

34:28.943 --> 34:30.176
Depends.

34:34.148 --> 34:35.849
You ever been with a boy
you didn't like that much

34:35.882 --> 34:37.050
and pretended
it was one you did?

34:41.288 --> 34:43.422
And did it work?

34:45.326 --> 34:49.262
Yeah, it didn't work that well
for me, either.

34:49.295 --> 34:53.632
What guy did you want it to be?

34:53.667 --> 34:56.402
If I told you,
I'd probably scare you away.

34:58.672 --> 35:00.874
You want another?

35:11.585 --> 35:14.120
You feel like
taking your sweater off?

35:14.155 --> 35:16.589
Right now?

35:20.261 --> 35:23.263
Okay.

36:10.377 --> 36:11.978
How does that feel?

36:14.181 --> 36:17.016
Cold.

36:17.051 --> 36:19.452
But, you know, good.

36:23.691 --> 36:24.958
Are you going to answer that?

36:26.293 --> 36:27.994
Fuck it.

36:32.132 --> 36:34.968
What is it?

36:35.002 --> 36:38.404
No. I can't.
Ask Ellsberg.

36:38.439 --> 36:41.541
How-- how high is her fever?

36:41.575 --> 36:43.743
How far along?

36:43.777 --> 36:46.145
No.

36:46.180 --> 36:48.414
Can't you find someone else?!

36:48.449 --> 36:52.185
Fine. Prep the OR.
I'm on my way.

36:57.858 --> 36:59.792
Can you give me a ride?

37:17.711 --> 37:20.079
Dr. Haas?

37:20.114 --> 37:22.448
Dr. Haas?

37:22.483 --> 37:25.351
We're ready for you now,
Doctor.

37:42.970 --> 37:44.871
There was nothing
to write home about,

37:44.905 --> 37:47.106
but Lenore's taking us
to see a few more places today.

37:47.140 --> 37:50.142
There's a duplex on Fairfield
she's excited for us to see.

37:50.177 --> 37:51.143
Good morning!

37:51.178 --> 37:52.712
I was just filling Bill in

37:52.746 --> 37:54.280
on our
real-estate adventures.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.048
Libby, you know that two-bedroom

37:56.083 --> 37:57.617
with the green shutters?

37:57.651 --> 37:59.819
The one with the
smoke stains above the mantel?

37:59.853 --> 38:01.520
You'd have thought
they'd have painted.

38:01.555 --> 38:04.457
I've decided
to make an offer on it.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.259
It's the first house
you've seen.

38:06.293 --> 38:09.128
Third.
We saw two others first.

38:09.162 --> 38:10.630
Still.

38:10.664 --> 38:14.467
Look, it needs some
paint and a chimney sweeping.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.369
But I can probably do better
on the price

38:16.403 --> 38:17.670
if it isn't in ship-shape.

38:17.704 --> 38:19.605
If it suits my needs,
why not grab it?

38:19.640 --> 38:20.940
In a few months,
if I don't love it,

38:20.974 --> 38:23.042
I'll find something else.

38:25.445 --> 38:28.814
Well, that's
a very cavalier attitude.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.017
Look, it's not that my sister

38:31.051 --> 38:33.085
hasn't been generous,
because she has.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.655
But Darlene isn't
the easiest person in the world

38:35.689 --> 38:36.756
to get along with.

38:36.790 --> 38:39.258
She's got a very strong
point of view,

38:39.293 --> 38:41.427
and you can't change her mind
about anything.

38:41.461 --> 38:43.796
And I think the sooner
I find a place here, the better.

38:43.830 --> 38:46.499
So Darlene
is hard for you to bear?

38:46.533 --> 38:49.235
Well, she's-- she's very moody.

38:49.269 --> 38:51.938
And I have had enough.
It's time for me to go.

38:51.972 --> 38:55.041
Well, good for you,

38:55.075 --> 38:59.111
for taking care of yourself,
recognizing your limits.

38:59.146 --> 39:00.379
I'm trying to.

39:00.414 --> 39:01.714
Oh, and succeeding.
I mean, look at you.

39:01.748 --> 39:02.982
Traveling on your own,

39:03.016 --> 39:05.084
making decisions
on the spur of the moment,

39:05.118 --> 39:08.120
taking the risk that things
will work out someplace new.

39:08.155 --> 39:13.059
I honestly didn't think
you had it in you, mother.

39:13.093 --> 39:16.028
Bill, what kind
of a thing is that to say?

39:18.432 --> 39:21.033
It's better late
than never, son.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.238
Is it?

39:34.548 --> 39:37.516
<i>What are you doing?!</i>
<i>I said put that down!</i>

39:37.551 --> 39:40.019
<i>Daddy, I'm sorry!</i>

39:40.053 --> 39:42.088
<i>- No! How many times?!</i>
<i>- Sorry!</i>

39:42.122 --> 39:43.856
<i>How many times now?!</i>

39:43.890 --> 39:45.624
<i>- One!</i>
<i>- No!</i>

39:45.659 --> 39:48.160
<i>Two!</i>

39:51.531 --> 39:54.266
<i>Help me!</i>

39:55.302 --> 39:57.937
<i>Help me!</i>

40:01.108 --> 40:04.143
Clamps and cup.

40:09.683 --> 40:12.351
Thank you. Thank you.

40:12.386 --> 40:13.419
And there we go.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.821
What do you have there,
Florene?

40:15.856 --> 40:17.056
It's a boy.

40:17.090 --> 40:20.326
Nicholas.
After her father.

40:28.136 --> 40:30.836
Hey, looks like there's
a bleed in there.

40:30.837 --> 40:32.371
I'm sorry, sir. Where?

40:32.406 --> 40:33.706
Kelly clamp, please.

40:33.740 --> 40:34.974
I'm not seeing it.

40:35.008 --> 40:36.609
Damn.
On the other side, too.

40:36.643 --> 40:37.676
Isn't that her fallopian--

40:37.711 --> 40:38.878
It's another bleeder, Farraday.

40:38.912 --> 40:40.279
Are you certain, sir, becau--

40:40.313 --> 40:42.515
Are you questioning
my authority here, Doctor?

40:42.549 --> 40:43.716
No, sir.

40:43.750 --> 40:45.851
Good.
Then let's tie them both off.

40:45.886 --> 40:47.953
Plain suture, please.

40:54.694 --> 40:56.328
Aspirin.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.368
Thanks.

41:02.402 --> 41:04.603
Is your patient--
Fine.

41:07.174 --> 41:08.774
Very, very lucky.

41:11.478 --> 41:14.346
I'm sorry about last night.

41:16.216 --> 41:20.086
I was punishing someone,
but it ended up being you.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.520
It's okay.

41:21.555 --> 41:23.789
No.

41:23.824 --> 41:25.791
No, it's not.

41:28.995 --> 41:31.597
I used to think
I was a pretty good guy.

41:31.631 --> 41:32.965
You were good to me.

41:34.968 --> 41:37.002
Jesus, come on.

41:37.037 --> 41:39.138
At my Sweet 16,

41:39.172 --> 41:44.176
I had these awful bangs
and pimples

41:44.211 --> 41:47.813
and an overbite like Mister Ed.

41:47.848 --> 41:50.549
And I asked you to dance
because I knew you'd say no.

41:50.584 --> 41:52.017
And that would confirm
everything

41:52.052 --> 41:55.855
I already thought about myself.

41:55.889 --> 41:58.724
But you didn't say no.

41:58.758 --> 42:00.960
You said yes.

42:03.263 --> 42:08.033
"It'd be my pleasure,"
you said.

42:08.068 --> 42:11.837
You in your tux.

42:11.872 --> 42:15.007
You looked so handsome
in black and white.

42:19.779 --> 42:22.047
I didn't
expect it to take so long.

42:22.082 --> 42:23.315
I was getting worried.

42:23.350 --> 42:25.918
Hey, knock that off!

42:27.487 --> 42:28.854
Thanks a million, Doc.
We owe you.

42:28.889 --> 42:30.689
If you ever need me
to set you up

42:30.724 --> 42:31.891
with a set of tires, say--

42:31.925 --> 42:34.326
What do you think of Nicholas?

42:34.361 --> 42:37.563
Andrew.
We're calling him Andrew.

42:37.597 --> 42:40.499
Stan's brother.

42:40.534 --> 42:42.701
Have you held him yet?

42:42.736 --> 42:45.037
I told him,
I says, "You're gonna drop him."

42:45.071 --> 42:46.772
I wouldn't.

42:46.806 --> 42:47.973
You can hold him
when he's bigger.

42:48.008 --> 42:49.275
But he'll just be
heavier when he's bigger.

42:49.309 --> 42:52.711
Hey!
What did I say?

42:52.746 --> 42:56.248
My kid's got
a smart mouth on him, Doctor.

42:56.283 --> 42:59.185
Maybe this one
will be a little better behaved.

42:59.219 --> 43:01.587
And the next one,
please, God, a girl.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.989
You hear that, honey?

43:16.002 --> 43:18.671
Thank you, Doctor.

43:25.378 --> 43:28.080
Can you look after this for me?

43:55.075 --> 43:57.209
Do you have that letter
of recommendation

43:57.244 --> 43:58.444
I promised Hellwarth?

43:58.478 --> 44:00.112
Bill,
I've made a terrible mistake.

44:00.146 --> 44:02.314
Okay.
Well, retype it, then.

44:02.349 --> 44:05.251
No, uh, an error in judgment.

44:05.285 --> 44:08.721
Well, wouldn't be
the first time, would it?

44:08.755 --> 44:11.156
No, which is why I wanted

44:11.191 --> 44:13.359
to come clean about it
right away.

44:18.999 --> 44:20.833
Are you intentionally
being cryptic?

44:22.969 --> 44:26.238
I allowed someone I
know to participate in the study

44:26.273 --> 44:31.176
without disclosing
the nature of our relationship.

44:31.211 --> 44:33.012
My ex-husband.

44:35.448 --> 44:36.715
I see.

44:36.750 --> 44:39.585
Not that it's any excuse,

44:39.619 --> 44:42.855
but he-- he has lost
a few gigs recently.

44:42.889 --> 44:44.823
He's really strapped.

44:44.858 --> 44:46.258
And he--

44:46.293 --> 44:48.394
he saw that we were offering
a fee to the participants.

44:48.428 --> 44:51.797
How recently was this?
I don't recall a Johnson.

44:51.831 --> 44:53.932
Oh, he used a different name.

44:53.967 --> 44:54.967
Which was?

44:55.001 --> 44:57.002
I would prefer not to say.

44:58.905 --> 45:02.341
Bill, I know that I put
the study at risk once before,

45:02.375 --> 45:03.809
but this is different,

45:03.843 --> 45:07.279
it shouldn't comprise
our research in-- in any way.

45:07.314 --> 45:11.550
Regardless of who he is,
the data is still sound.

45:11.584 --> 45:14.853
I don't think
that you need to know.

45:14.888 --> 45:17.089
I agree.

45:39.579 --> 45:41.980
How many sexual partners
do you estimate you've had?

45:42.015 --> 45:42.981
Two maybe?

45:43.016 --> 45:44.116
Any children?

45:44.150 --> 45:45.551
Praise the Lord, yes.

45:45.585 --> 45:49.021
There's Linda-Lee
and Marcus Jr.

45:49.055 --> 45:52.725
Are you generally
the one to initiate coitus?

45:52.759 --> 45:55.260
Well, these days.

45:55.295 --> 45:57.730
She used to like
calling the shots in bed.

45:57.764 --> 46:01.900
She's-- she's like that,
a take-charge kind of woman.

46:04.037 --> 46:05.437
Sometimes we'd go dancing.

46:05.472 --> 46:07.639
There'd come a point
where I'd have to say,

46:07.674 --> 46:09.174
"You know, honey, sometimes

46:09.209 --> 46:11.276
it wouldn't kill you
to let me lead."

46:25.792 --> 46:27.993
Walter McAddy.

46:37.137 --> 46:39.638
Oh, you're so sweet
to do all the dishes.

46:39.672 --> 46:41.473
I get so tired
in the evening lately.

46:41.508 --> 46:44.443
I set a plate aside for Bill.

46:44.477 --> 46:47.212
- Oh. He often works late.
- Mm.

46:47.247 --> 46:49.815
Try not to take it
personally. I don't.

46:49.849 --> 46:52.017
Only sometimes you do.

46:53.787 --> 46:56.522
To be honest, I-I--

46:56.556 --> 46:59.291
I think he's on edge
about the baby.

46:59.325 --> 47:02.194
For a man who expects his work
to change the world,

47:02.228 --> 47:04.763
he doesn't want his life
to change too much.

47:04.798 --> 47:07.499
Well, a baby changes everything.

47:11.104 --> 47:14.907
What was Bill's father like?

47:14.941 --> 47:17.943
He doesn't talk much about him.

47:17.977 --> 47:22.681
Well... Francis wasn't a...

47:22.715 --> 47:24.149
bad man.

47:27.253 --> 47:30.155
That's not the same thing
as being a good man.

47:32.492 --> 47:34.092
Bill is a good man.

47:34.127 --> 47:35.727
I know.

47:35.762 --> 47:37.830
Maybe if he
understood his father better,

47:37.864 --> 47:39.865
and-- and you and he
talked more about him--

47:39.899 --> 47:41.667
Oh, honey.

47:43.403 --> 47:45.904
You don't know men very well.

47:45.939 --> 47:47.706
Women look back.

47:47.740 --> 47:51.877
But men,
they just look straight ahead.

47:51.911 --> 47:56.248
Disappointment and... regret--

47:56.282 --> 47:57.850
that's where we live.

47:57.884 --> 48:01.987
But men, they run from it.

48:02.021 --> 48:04.556
Toward what?

48:04.591 --> 48:05.991
Well, I guess,

48:06.025 --> 48:10.229
toward the best distraction
there is--

48:10.263 --> 48:11.964
pleasure.

48:15.368 --> 48:17.903
Thank you
for coming back, Mr. McAddy.

48:17.937 --> 48:20.873
So, you said on the
phone it's just gonna be you?

48:20.907 --> 48:26.345
Uh, we've found that, uh,
the presence of a female researcher

48:26.379 --> 48:29.815
can be inhibiting for a male
and vice versa.

48:29.849 --> 48:33.585
So we sometimes find it best
to follow up, uh,

48:33.620 --> 48:36.421
with one-on-ones.

48:36.456 --> 48:38.457
So, no jerking off, right?

48:39.726 --> 48:42.127
No.

48:42.161 --> 48:44.363
Just talking...

48:44.397 --> 48:48.133
about what attracts you
to someone,

48:48.167 --> 48:50.402
how you receive pleasure,
how you give it.

48:50.436 --> 48:52.137
Chemistry, right?

48:52.171 --> 48:54.806
Uh, I didn't do too good at it
in school,

48:54.841 --> 48:57.376
but I get an A-plus in it
in bed.

48:57.410 --> 49:01.580
There was a woman
you mentioned in your interview,

49:01.614 --> 49:05.384
someone you said you see
off and on?

49:05.418 --> 49:07.419
Yeah.

49:07.453 --> 49:10.055
Oh, is it all right
if I record this?

49:16.996 --> 49:23.368
Is intercourse always a mutually
satisfying experience for you?

49:23.403 --> 49:24.836
You mean do we both orgasm?

49:27.040 --> 49:29.641
Yes.

49:29.676 --> 49:32.344
Not always at the same time.

49:32.378 --> 49:36.515
But sure. Climaxing's
not a problem for her.

49:36.549 --> 49:39.484
And do you two
rely on the same positions

49:39.519 --> 49:40.686
again and again?

49:40.720 --> 49:44.089
She likes to mix it up
position-wise.

49:44.123 --> 49:47.025
But we usually start
the same way,

49:47.060 --> 49:48.994
you know,

49:49.028 --> 49:51.797
with me going down on her,

49:51.831 --> 49:55.033
and me warming her up.

49:55.068 --> 49:58.103
She's not shy.

49:58.137 --> 50:00.372
She'll tell me how fast to go,

50:00.406 --> 50:03.275
how long to stay
in a certain spot.

50:06.479 --> 50:08.647
Is this the kind of stuff
you want to hear?

50:12.885 --> 50:16.054
<i>She sometimes likes it</i>
<i>when I half pull out,</i>

50:16.089 --> 50:17.656
<i>when I'm barely inside,</i>

50:17.690 --> 50:21.393
<i>and she'll just rock against</i>
<i>me, to get me deeper.</i>

50:21.427 --> 50:25.497
<i>Maybe I shouldn't be talking</i>
<i>about this woman in particular.</i>

50:25.531 --> 50:27.065
<i>She's not the norm.</i>

50:27.100 --> 50:30.002
<i>If you're getting</i>
<i>at what it's like with me</i>

50:30.036 --> 50:32.537
<i>in bed with a girl</i>
<i>most of the time,</i>

50:32.572 --> 50:34.506
<i>- then this isn't it.</i>
<i>- And why is that?</i>

50:34.540 --> 50:37.576
<i>Because this one's different.</i>

50:37.610 --> 50:41.079
<i>She knows herself.</i>

50:41.114 --> 50:42.481
<i>She knows what feels good.</i>

50:42.515 --> 50:43.849
- Excuse me, Bill?
<i>- She'll tell you.</i>

50:43.883 --> 50:45.884
If I leave right now,

50:45.918 --> 50:47.719
I just might be able to put
dinner on the table for my kids.

50:47.754 --> 50:48.854
Do you mind?

50:48.888 --> 50:50.656
- No. Go.
- Thank you.

50:50.690 --> 50:52.290
Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

50:52.325 --> 50:53.959
Good night.

51:05.271 --> 51:07.205
<i>And why is that?</i>

51:07.240 --> 51:11.810
<i>Because this one's different.</i>

51:11.844 --> 51:15.313
<i>She knows herself.</i>

51:15.348 --> 51:18.517
<i>She knows what feels good.</i>

51:18.551 --> 51:21.053
She'll tell you.

51:21.087 --> 51:25.323
And she wants you to tell her

51:25.358 --> 51:28.627
what you want her to do to you,

51:28.661 --> 51:32.431
what your fantasy is,

51:32.465 --> 51:36.334
which is a fantasy in itself,

51:36.369 --> 51:39.771
am I right?

51:39.806 --> 51:43.341
I'm telling you, Doctor.

51:43.376 --> 51:45.911
This woman...

51:45.945 --> 51:48.346
is magic.

52:04.631 --> 52:07.400
<i># And to think #</i>

52:07.434 --> 52:10.169
<i># all along #</i>

52:10.204 --> 52:12.872
<i># now I've crossed #</i>

52:12.906 --> 52:15.842
<i># to the unknown #</i>

52:15.876 --> 52:21.547
<i># and I'm looking</i>
<i>for a way back home #</i>

52:21.582 --> 52:24.117
<i># where does this door go? #</i>

52:24.151 --> 52:26.919
<i># I haven't been through #</i>

52:26.954 --> 52:30.022
<i># it's not feeling normal #</i>

52:30.057 --> 52:31.942
<i># I thought that I knew #</i>

52:32.759 --> 52:35.432
<i># where does this door go? #</i>

52:36.305 --> 52:42.323
