WEBVTT

00:11.059 --> 00:12.254
Unh. No.

00:12.827 --> 00:14.556
Come on, Robin.

00:20.135 --> 00:21.193
Robin!

00:22.837 --> 00:24.277
All right, come on.
Come on, come on.

00:24.439 --> 00:26.498
Yeah! Come on!

00:32.046 --> 00:33.536
There you go.

00:45.693 --> 00:46.819
Freeze!

01:02.243 --> 01:04.108
Let's go, let's go.

01:36.377 --> 01:37.538
What's up?

01:37.712 --> 01:39.476
What case...?

01:39.814 --> 01:41.174
- Sorry. What?
- I said what ca...?

01:44.919 --> 01:47.081
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I just couldn't help it.

01:47.255 --> 01:49.519
- She's just... She's just so pretty.
- Mm-hm.

01:49.857 --> 01:51.188
What case is this for?

01:51.359 --> 01:53.885
This, my friend,
is the case for Marty Deeks

01:54.062 --> 01:56.588
living a life of freedom
on the open road.

01:56.864 --> 01:57.922
This is your bike?

01:58.099 --> 02:01.125
All 865 cc's of her.
Military green 1100.

02:01.302 --> 02:04.761
You can, uh...
You can pet her if you want to.

02:05.640 --> 02:09.008
- Hetty know about this?
- What? No.

02:11.679 --> 02:16.776
What, like I need Hetty's permission
to buy a motorcycle? Ha, ha. Please.

02:21.923 --> 02:26.759
- Heh. What the hell is that?
- That beauty goes with my new ride.

02:27.829 --> 02:29.024
You bought a motorcycle?

02:29.197 --> 02:32.132
- He bought a motorcycle?
- He did indeed.

02:32.767 --> 02:34.327
Does Hetty know you bought
a motorcycle?

02:34.469 --> 02:36.938
I see what's happening here.
I'm excited about my bike,

02:37.105 --> 02:39.386
you're trying to deny me that pleasure
for your amusement,

02:39.540 --> 02:41.235
like the pack of jackals that you are.

02:41.409 --> 02:42.706
He doesn't know the rule.

02:42.877 --> 02:44.402
- What?
- You didn't tell him the rule?

02:44.579 --> 02:46.419
- I didn't think I had to.
- He's your partner.

02:46.581 --> 02:49.141
- You should be telling him the rules.
- He is still in the room.

02:49.284 --> 02:51.082
Hi. How are you? What's the rule?

02:51.252 --> 02:53.983
NCIS agents work hard
and play safe.

02:54.489 --> 02:56.609
No matter how much danger
we put ourselves in at work,

02:56.758 --> 02:59.386
when we're off the clock,
we don't take unnecessary risks.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.823
Are you...? Are you kidding me?

03:00.995 --> 03:02.463
Because I jumped
on a speeding train,

03:02.630 --> 03:04.462
took out a psychopath
with a flamethrower,

03:04.632 --> 03:06.066
and that was all before breakfast.

03:06.234 --> 03:08.134
When the train stopped,
I got you a bran muffin.

03:08.303 --> 03:10.601
- That was a good muffin.
- You know what?

03:10.772 --> 03:12.570
- It's not a problem.
- Okay. Thank you.

03:12.740 --> 03:15.368
All he has to do is get rid of that bike
before Hetty sees it.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.979
No. We're not getting rid of anything.
I just got it. It has 12 miles on it.

03:19.147 --> 03:20.945
- Easier to sell.
- I'm not selling it!

03:21.115 --> 03:24.574
- How come I never heard of this rule?
- Probably you're not an NCIS agent.

03:24.752 --> 03:27.119
- Ooh. Touché.
- Yeah.

03:27.288 --> 03:29.814
Not how you use the word "touché,”
but you're getting better.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.755
You know what?
Let me settle this once and for all.

03:35.930 --> 03:37.125
Hetty, hi.

03:37.298 --> 03:40.529
Ahem. Can I, uh,
ask you a question?

03:40.902 --> 03:41.960
No.

03:43.471 --> 03:45.371
No as in I can't ask you a question?

03:45.540 --> 03:48.009
No. Upstairs. There's a case.

03:50.912 --> 03:53.176
You're not even curious
of what the question is?

03:53.348 --> 03:54.679
No.

03:54.849 --> 03:56.248
Heh. Okay.

03:56.417 --> 03:59.045
I cherish these conversations.

03:59.420 --> 04:02.720
Feel like we're really bonding
as a couple.

04:04.425 --> 04:05.620
What do we have, kids?

04:05.793 --> 04:07.727
Forcible abduction in broad daylight.

04:07.895 --> 04:09.989
This just happened.

04:14.068 --> 04:15.502
Oh, man.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.194
Ouch.

04:17.372 --> 04:20.899
L.A.P.D. isn't releasing her
name until they can notify next of kin,

04:21.075 --> 04:22.839
but thanks
to her race registration number,

04:23.010 --> 04:24.978
we've ID'd her as Robin Henson.

04:25.146 --> 04:28.309
- She Navy?
- No, but her boyfriend was.

04:28.483 --> 04:30.815
William Garrett.
He was an intelligence officer.

04:30.985 --> 04:33.852
He specialized in highly classified
drone navigation design.

04:34.021 --> 04:35.819
Wait. So "was" or "is"?

04:35.990 --> 04:38.891
Was. He took an early discharge
from the Navy just last week.

04:39.394 --> 04:41.055
- Why?
- Not sure.

04:41.229 --> 04:42.754
The file doesn't give an explanation.

04:42.930 --> 04:44.091
Oddly coincidental.

04:44.265 --> 04:47.701
Kidnappers could have grabbed
the girlfriend to trade for naval secrets.

04:48.102 --> 04:49.763
Well, we're looking for the van.

04:49.937 --> 04:51.371
No joy so far.

04:51.539 --> 04:54.236
It's odd. These guys picked
the most public moment

04:54.409 --> 04:56.377
in the most public place possible
to grab her.

04:56.544 --> 05:00.071
So are they ruthless, brazen,
or just stupid?

05:00.281 --> 05:02.579
Well, let's hope it's the latter
and not all three.

05:02.884 --> 05:03.942
Where's Garrett?

05:04.118 --> 05:06.177
Well, he's not answering
his home phone,

05:06.354 --> 05:07.788
and his cell phone's in Koreatown.

05:07.955 --> 05:09.955
- Not answering that either.
- Send us the address.

05:10.124 --> 05:12.804
Check out the crime scene, see
if there's anything that can help us.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.019
- I'll go see Hetty.
- Keep looking for the van,

05:15.196 --> 05:16.876
or anything you can find
on his girlfriend.

05:17.031 --> 05:18.226
Yup.

05:19.801 --> 05:20.893
Hetty, hey.

05:21.068 --> 05:24.003
I'm, uh, heading out to the crime scene
with Kensi,

05:24.172 --> 05:29.667
but I just wanted to let you know
officially that, uh, Uncle Marty's back.

05:32.079 --> 05:34.548
My head is right, I'm feeling good.
You know, feeling strong.

05:34.715 --> 05:37.377
I could rock out 50 burpees for you
right now if you asked me to.

05:37.552 --> 05:39.042
How's your heart?

05:39.320 --> 05:40.810
My heart? My heart's great.

05:40.988 --> 05:43.150
I'm running sub-five 30 miles,
I got a new road bike,

05:43.324 --> 05:44.951
thinking about doing
the Malibu Ironman.

05:45.126 --> 05:48.027
I'm like a Shaolin monk
with a young bull,

05:48.196 --> 05:50.392
mixed with, like,
a very charismatic cheetah.

05:50.565 --> 05:53.227
I meant your emotional center.

05:53.401 --> 05:54.493
My emotional center?

05:55.970 --> 05:59.964
- I don't think I follow.
- I'm pretty certain you do.

06:01.008 --> 06:04.069
Heh. Okay, let's just say for the sake
of argument that I do follow you.

06:04.245 --> 06:06.407
Then I would say that it's fine.
It's better than fine.

06:06.581 --> 06:08.276
I'd say it's phenomenal.

06:08.449 --> 06:11.976
I mean, you heard what I said about
the Shaolin monk with the cheetah?

06:16.958 --> 06:18.448
Okay.

06:19.961 --> 06:23.556
I understand that you worry about me
more than the others.

06:23.731 --> 06:27.361
Um, that's mostly because
I'm your favorite.

06:27.802 --> 06:29.429
Obviously.

06:29.604 --> 06:31.333
Don't say otherwise.
It'll break my heart.

06:31.506 --> 06:33.702
But I want you to know
that I'm great.

06:34.308 --> 06:36.777
I'm actually... I'm better than great.

06:36.944 --> 06:38.036
Kensi's great.

06:39.647 --> 06:41.376
I see.

06:42.650 --> 06:43.776
What do you mean, you see?

06:43.951 --> 06:45.316
Why, did Kensi say something?

06:45.486 --> 06:47.486
Because if she said something
that contrasted that,

06:47.655 --> 06:50.695
I think it's because, at this point,
well, it's... It's difficult to explain.

06:50.858 --> 06:54.795
I think it's personal feelings at...
No, wow. No. Ha, ha.

06:54.962 --> 06:57.329
I'm not gonna fall for this.
I'm not one of your minions.

06:57.498 --> 06:59.796
I'm not gonna fall
for your Jedi mind tricks.

07:02.970 --> 07:04.438
Is it getting cold in here?

07:04.605 --> 07:07.597
Because I feel like
it just got, like, rapidly cold in here.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.244
Like I need, like, earmuffs
because my fingers are tingling.

07:10.411 --> 07:14.814
Could be, um,
early signs of Raynaud's.

07:16.517 --> 07:19.248
- What's that?
- Look it up.

07:19.587 --> 07:22.056
Better yet, get it checked out.

07:24.659 --> 07:26.149
I will.

07:42.710 --> 07:44.576
Nobody home.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.407
No, we're not doing that.
It's a bad idea.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.517
We've been through this before,
it didn't work.

07:50.685 --> 07:52.278
- Federal agents!
- What the hell?

07:52.453 --> 07:53.943
- William Garrett?
- Yeah.

07:54.722 --> 07:57.191
Special Agent G. Callen,
Sam Hanna, NCIS.

07:57.358 --> 07:59.622
- Who are these people?
- They work for me.

07:59.794 --> 08:02.263
- Doing what?
- Software design.

08:06.367 --> 08:08.461
We need to talk to you in private.

08:08.636 --> 08:10.536
Yeah, sure. What's this about?

08:10.705 --> 08:12.139
No, I told you this would happen.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.637
- Who are you?
- I'm Oscar Balsam. I'm his partner.

08:15.810 --> 08:16.971
Told him what would happen?

08:17.144 --> 08:20.478
That Uncle Sam was gonna use
strong-arm tactics to shut us down.

08:21.148 --> 08:22.309
Is that what this is about?

08:26.287 --> 08:28.915
The only strong-arm tactics
are the ones being used by these men

08:29.090 --> 08:30.387
that kidnapped your girlfriend.

08:34.361 --> 08:36.352
Oh, my God.

08:38.099 --> 08:39.863
That's Robin.

08:50.777 --> 08:53.075
Garrett's
company is a software start-up

08:53.246 --> 08:55.544
called RedtceQ.
He began it before joining the Navy,

08:55.715 --> 08:59.015
and they've developed an app
that aggregates GPS data

08:59.185 --> 09:04.055
to predict wait times at airports,
different stores, the DMV, wherever.

09:04.224 --> 09:07.592
That's useful, but it's hardly the stuff
kidnappings are made of. Is that it?

09:07.761 --> 09:09.456
It's the only thing they released.

09:09.629 --> 09:12.098
There's nothing that could have
any military applications?

09:12.265 --> 09:14.165
Not unless it's still in development,

09:14.334 --> 09:17.895
and if they do have something,
they better launch it soon.

09:18.071 --> 09:19.869
According to bank statements,

09:20.040 --> 09:22.771
they're about a month away
from having the lights turned off.

09:23.076 --> 09:24.601
What about Garrett's phone records?

09:24.878 --> 09:25.970
I'm going through them now,

09:26.146 --> 09:29.013
but the only calls he received
since Robin's abduction

09:29.182 --> 09:31.981
were from L.A.P.D. and us.
Nothing from the kidnappers.

09:32.152 --> 09:34.712
Oh, and no luck finding that van,
either.

09:34.988 --> 09:36.717
All right, keep looking,

09:36.890 --> 09:38.289
and check in with Kensi and Deeks,

09:38.458 --> 09:40.051
- see if they found anything.
- On it.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.658
Who would do something stupid...

09:42.829 --> 09:44.593
Just doing your jobs. Don't speculate.

09:47.300 --> 09:48.392
Hi.

09:52.005 --> 09:53.973
Uh, sorry that took so long.

09:54.140 --> 09:57.201
I was stuck behind an old man
on a scooter for the past six blocks.

09:57.377 --> 09:59.106
I'm sure he appreciated
your patience.

09:59.279 --> 10:01.475
Well, he flipped me off
before I finally passed him.

10:01.815 --> 10:02.941
He was probably just waving.

10:03.350 --> 10:05.614
He called me a ginger bitch.

10:07.754 --> 10:09.483
- Yeah, I got nothing for that.
- Mm-hm.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.886
Why weren't you answering
your phone?

10:15.061 --> 10:17.621
We go unplugged
for the first hour of the day

10:17.797 --> 10:20.596
in order to brainstorm
without interruption.

10:20.767 --> 10:22.132
What about your e-mails?

10:22.302 --> 10:23.633
Anyone try to contact you?

10:23.803 --> 10:26.329
For, like, a ransom?
Why would they do that?

10:27.040 --> 10:29.702
Well, it's possible the kidnappers
want access to your Navy intel

10:29.876 --> 10:33.744
on drone navigations
in exchange for Robin.

10:33.913 --> 10:36.507
- Oh, this is my fault.
- It's no one's fault,

10:37.017 --> 10:38.712
but we're gonna need
your full cooperation.

10:38.885 --> 10:40.944
Yeah, sure.
What do you want me to do?

10:41.121 --> 10:44.022
- Want me to send everybody home?
- No, no. Act like nothing happened.

10:44.190 --> 10:46.454
William Garrett, Nell Jones.
She's one of our analysts.

10:46.626 --> 10:48.386
She's gonna help us
get your girlfriend back.

10:48.595 --> 10:49.619
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:49.796 --> 10:51.127
May I see your phone, please?

10:52.432 --> 10:56.062
So I'll monitor your calls and e-mails,
check your hardware and servers,

10:56.236 --> 10:58.466
to see if anyone's tried
accessing your systems.

10:58.772 --> 11:01.298
- You need any help?
- No. I'm good.

11:01.474 --> 11:03.442
Let us know if the rest of them
give you trouble.

11:03.610 --> 11:05.669
I think I'll be fine. I speak geek.

11:05.845 --> 11:07.643
These are my people.

11:11.785 --> 11:14.220
So whoever grabbed this woman,
Robin,

11:14.387 --> 11:17.288
did so at the end
of a 10-kilometer fun run?

11:17.457 --> 11:19.357
- Callen's right, it's just weird.
- Yeah.

11:19.526 --> 11:21.426
Who runs for fun?

11:21.594 --> 11:24.291
They thought she'd put up less
of a fight because she was so tired.

11:24.564 --> 11:28.523
Well, not to mention the Taser
and a ton of witnesses.

11:28.702 --> 11:31.967
They're following her, they know she's
on the run, where the finish line is.

11:32.138 --> 11:33.498
Maybe something forced their hand.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.160
They had no choice
but to grab her here

11:35.308 --> 11:36.742
in front of all these people.

11:37.377 --> 11:40.540
Unless they wanted people
to see it happen.

11:42.882 --> 11:44.680
I think we're done here.

11:45.485 --> 11:46.680
Speaking of which,

11:46.853 --> 11:49.550
I couldn't help but notice
you neglected to acknowledge the fact

11:49.723 --> 11:52.818
that you too
own and operate a motorcycle.

11:52.992 --> 11:56.189
Ha, ha. "Speaking of which"?

11:56.362 --> 11:58.660
How does that relate
to anything we were talking about?

11:58.832 --> 12:00.392
Don't do that.
Don't change the subject.

12:00.533 --> 12:01.728
You just changed the subject.

12:01.901 --> 12:04.563
- So you admit you have a motorcycle?
- Yeah, for undercover work.

12:04.738 --> 12:07.708
I've seen you drive it on weekends.
That, my friend, is a double standard.

12:07.874 --> 12:10.275
Okay, do you know
how many returning veterans

12:10.443 --> 12:11.723
have been killed on motorcycles?

12:11.878 --> 12:13.869
You know how many surfers
survive shark attacks?

12:14.447 --> 12:16.779
- What does have to do with anything?
- Exactly.

12:17.383 --> 12:20.648
Look, deaths from motor vehicle
collisions, specifically motorcycles,

12:20.820 --> 12:23.949
are more prominent than suicides
and overdoses in returning veterans.

12:24.124 --> 12:25.614
Five times the national average.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.472
Okay, I admit
that it's a tragic statistic,

12:27.627 --> 12:29.595
but irrelevant to me,
I am not a combat veteran.

12:30.597 --> 12:35.125
No, you're not, but you went
through a very traumatic experience.

12:36.269 --> 12:37.794
Is that what this is about?

12:38.505 --> 12:41.065
I know what I'm talking about, okay?

12:42.709 --> 12:44.803
Risky behavior is one of the most
common symptoms

12:44.978 --> 12:47.618
- of posttraumatic stress.
- Okay, maybe this isn't risky behavior.

12:47.781 --> 12:50.273
Maybe I just read some Kerouac
and saw Easy Rider

12:50.450 --> 12:51.576
and I wanna feel the wind.

12:51.751 --> 12:54.591
You can't feel the wind in your hair
if you're wearing a helmet, genius.

12:54.754 --> 12:58.054
You know what? Kensi, you don't...

12:58.525 --> 13:00.050
You don't have to worry about me.

13:00.226 --> 13:02.422
- Yes, ldo. Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

13:04.831 --> 13:06.765
You're my partner, Deeks.

13:06.933 --> 13:09.402
It is my job to keep you safe.

13:13.206 --> 13:16.107
Now, get in the car
and put on your seat belt.

13:16.376 --> 13:19.141
Yes, Mom.
You got a kid's seat in the back?

13:19.546 --> 13:20.945
Anything?

13:21.114 --> 13:22.707
Not yet.

13:30.423 --> 13:33.154
I think you've got some admirers.

13:33.326 --> 13:37.285
Yeah, I tried asking them
about Garrett's business practices.

13:37.463 --> 13:38.624
And?

13:38.798 --> 13:41.597
They were more interested in talking
about my gun.

13:41.768 --> 13:44.328
What's with that, guys and guns?

13:44.637 --> 13:46.833
I think it's more about cute girls
with guns.

13:50.376 --> 13:53.175
Is it just me, or does it look like
most of these guys

13:53.346 --> 13:55.838
share the same DNA as Eric?

13:56.015 --> 13:58.985
- You think?
- It's creepy.

13:59.152 --> 14:00.449
Yeah.

14:03.022 --> 14:05.150
Someone's calling Garrett's cell.

14:11.764 --> 14:14.290
- You ready, Sam?
- Yep.

14:23.676 --> 14:24.700
Hello?

14:24.878 --> 14:26.539
I have something of yours.

14:26.713 --> 14:28.044
Who is this?

14:28.214 --> 14:29.978
The guy babysitting your girlfriend.

14:30.149 --> 14:31.173
Let me talk to her.

14:31.351 --> 14:33.319
As soon as you give me what I want.

14:33.753 --> 14:35.551
Tell him you want proof of life.

14:36.923 --> 14:38.584
How do I know she's still alive?

14:38.758 --> 14:40.749
You don't. But if I wanted her dead,

14:40.927 --> 14:42.224
I would have killed her already.

14:43.396 --> 14:44.921
You've got one chance to save her.

14:45.098 --> 14:46.930
I'll call back in an hour with details.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.364
Make sure you're alone.

14:53.573 --> 14:55.371
Tell me you got him.

14:55.541 --> 14:57.509
- Um...
- Nell?

14:58.912 --> 15:00.573
Got him. Landline, fashion district.

15:00.747 --> 15:03.182
Send that to my phone.
Tell Kensi and Deeks to meet us there.

15:03.349 --> 15:04.949
See if Eric can get eyes
on the location.

15:05.118 --> 15:06.449
Got it.

15:11.891 --> 15:15.885
So I'm putting on a bulletproof vest,
to charge into a hostile environment,

15:16.062 --> 15:18.360
where some crazy-ass dudes
are probably gonna shoot me.

15:18.531 --> 15:20.192
- Probably.
- Okay, so answer me this.

15:20.366 --> 15:23.529
How is that safer
than riding a motorcycle?

15:23.703 --> 15:25.637
- Because I am here to protect you.
- Oh, I see.

15:25.805 --> 15:28.245
So in that case, if you rode on the back
of said motorcycle...

15:28.374 --> 15:31.071
Uh, that's not gonna happen,
I don't have a death wish.

15:31.244 --> 15:34.305
I don't either. I lift with my knees,
I don't eat gum I found in the street,

15:34.480 --> 15:36.209
- and I never run with scissors.
- What?

15:36.382 --> 15:38.022
That was once,
and I barely scratched you.

15:38.151 --> 15:39.744
- We got anything?
- Yeah.

15:39.919 --> 15:42.251
Uh, no movement since we got here,
no sign of the van,

15:42.422 --> 15:44.542
neighbors haven't seen anybody
go in and out in weeks.

15:44.691 --> 15:47.388
Eric's trying to get eyes,
but we're in a traffic-cam dead zone.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.959
That's probably by design.

15:49.128 --> 15:51.358
Owner said that the last tenants
left eight months ago.

15:51.531 --> 15:52.726
It's been vacant ever since.

15:52.899 --> 15:55.266
Ground floor has two entrances,
which one do you guys want?

15:55.435 --> 15:57.335
- Front.
- Oh, partners in sync.

15:57.503 --> 15:58.834
God, I hope we're that adorable.

15:59.005 --> 16:01.440
Just walk.

16:21.894 --> 16:24.295
Tried the front door. It's unlocked.

16:24.464 --> 16:25.659
- Ditto.
- Ready.

16:25.832 --> 16:26.993
On three.

16:27.166 --> 16:30.227
One, two, three.

16:43.016 --> 16:44.506
- Clear!
- Clear.

16:44.684 --> 16:47.016
- Clear.
- Clear.

16:49.789 --> 16:52.850
Well, that was uneventful.

16:53.026 --> 16:55.495
See? Told you it was safer
than a motorcycle.

16:56.229 --> 16:57.526
Get out!

17:06.005 --> 17:07.494
You okay?

17:10.810 --> 17:13.780
Yeah, that was a lot safer
than a motorcycle.

17:32.898 --> 17:34.366
Looks like they rigged blasting caps

17:34.533 --> 17:36.133
to the structural components
of the roof.

17:36.301 --> 17:38.395
Triggered it
with a 10-dollar motion sensor.

17:42.107 --> 17:43.632
Better model, we'd all be dead.

17:44.543 --> 17:47.740
- So who was that meant for, us?
- Maybe.

17:47.913 --> 17:49.574
May have been pre-rigged
for the exchange.

17:49.748 --> 17:51.807
Or a warning
for anyone who tried to help Garrett.

17:52.317 --> 17:54.251
Either way,
I'd say these guys are pros.

17:54.419 --> 17:57.081
Pros who are ready
to kill innocent people.

17:58.724 --> 18:00.818
I've been digging around,
trying to find someone

18:00.993 --> 18:02.313
who may have a beef with Garrett.

18:02.461 --> 18:04.589
I think I found a possible suspect.

18:04.763 --> 18:07.357
Jason Clarke.
He's a mechanical engineer

18:07.532 --> 18:09.057
who served alongside Garrett

18:09.234 --> 18:11.532
and was recently reprimanded
for putting a baseball bat

18:11.703 --> 18:12.864
through Garrett's windshield.

18:13.038 --> 18:15.530
- What happened there?
- The report is not specific.

18:15.707 --> 18:19.905
But I do see a check for $318
from Clarke to Garrett

18:20.078 --> 18:22.342
- probably to pay for the damage.
- That's fantastic.

18:22.514 --> 18:23.538
We got an address?

18:23.715 --> 18:26.082
Better than that, I have him
being brought to the boatshed.

18:26.251 --> 18:28.083
- Nice.
- Update Callen and Sam.

18:28.253 --> 18:30.847
- We will interrogate slugger boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:32.524 --> 18:34.458
Jason and I served together.

18:34.626 --> 18:37.288
- You two have issues?
- No.

18:37.462 --> 18:39.328
God, it's been almost an hour.

18:39.498 --> 18:41.466
Why haven't they called back?

18:41.633 --> 18:43.397
If you and Jason Clarke
didn't have issues,

18:43.568 --> 18:45.448
why'd he put a baseball bat
through your window?

18:45.604 --> 18:48.130
- I don't know. You should ask him.
- We will.

18:48.307 --> 18:50.708
What does it mean
if they haven't called back?

18:50.876 --> 18:52.310
- They'll call.
- How do you know?

18:52.477 --> 18:53.774
Because they want something.

18:53.946 --> 18:56.779
But right now, I need you to focus
so you can try and help us find her.

18:57.716 --> 18:59.616
- Why did he bust up your car?
- I don't know.

18:59.785 --> 19:03.119
Maybe because
he's a 'roid-raging hothead.

19:03.288 --> 19:06.519
He was pissed off that I left the Navy.
Said it was an act of disloyalty.

19:06.692 --> 19:07.750
- Was it?
- No.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.528
I'd had enough.
Wanted to focus on my business.

19:11.697 --> 19:15.065
He's one of those guys that blamed
everybody else for his problems.

19:15.233 --> 19:17.759
- What kind of problems?
- Passed over for promotions,

19:17.936 --> 19:20.633
money, relationships, you name it.

19:20.806 --> 19:22.399
Guy was a ticking time bomb.

19:22.574 --> 19:23.666
He know Robin?

19:24.009 --> 19:26.376
Not as well as he would've liked.

19:28.747 --> 19:31.648
He'd hit on your girl while you were
right there. You know the type.

19:32.017 --> 19:33.610
I hate that type.

19:35.487 --> 19:37.421
It's been an hour.

19:38.490 --> 19:40.117
Time's up.

19:43.462 --> 19:46.898
What sort of top secret
naval experiment did you come from?

19:47.065 --> 19:48.726
Deeks, wha...?

19:48.900 --> 19:51.870
- Have a seat.
- Have a seat.

19:52.471 --> 19:54.667
You want to tell me why I'm here?

19:55.974 --> 19:57.965
You know William Garrett?

19:58.276 --> 20:00.301
Yeah. We served together.

20:00.479 --> 20:02.004
Obviously not on a submarine.

20:03.181 --> 20:05.946
His girlfriend, Robin,
was abducted this morning.

20:06.118 --> 20:08.883
- By who?
- We're hoping you could help with that.

20:09.221 --> 20:10.382
How the hell should I know?

20:10.555 --> 20:11.750
Because you have a history.

20:11.923 --> 20:13.982
Evidently,
you went all Jose Canseco on him,

20:14.159 --> 20:16.890
put a baseball bat
through his windshield.

20:17.062 --> 20:18.655
Are you trying to annoy me?

20:18.830 --> 20:20.710
He doesn't have to try.
He's naturally annoying.

20:20.866 --> 20:22.129
It's a gift, really.

20:22.534 --> 20:24.002
I don't like to talk about it.

20:24.169 --> 20:25.762
Garrett's a selfish ass.

20:25.937 --> 20:27.268
We served together.

20:27.439 --> 20:29.874
He developed some cool stuff,
but it was me and my guys

20:30.042 --> 20:32.170
who actually built it,
and worked out the bugs.

20:32.344 --> 20:34.813
Because you have a degree
in engineering?

20:35.313 --> 20:38.908
Two. Plus my PhD.

20:39.785 --> 20:43.016
I can also tear a phone book in half
with my bare hands.

20:43.188 --> 20:44.788
Wow, I imagine that comes in
pretty handy

20:44.956 --> 20:46.754
now that we're in the digital age.

20:46.925 --> 20:49.485
Where do you find a phone book?
Do you get them off of eBay?

20:49.661 --> 20:52.358
- Listen, beach boy, anytime!
- Hey, sit down and shut up.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.431
And there it is.

20:59.204 --> 21:00.763
If you had anything to do with this,

21:00.939 --> 21:02.964
your next workout
is gonna be in a prison yard.

21:03.141 --> 21:04.438
Okay. Okay.

21:04.810 --> 21:06.904
I broke the guy's windshield.
Big deal.

21:07.079 --> 21:08.740
I paid for it.

21:08.914 --> 21:11.110
All I wanted was a chance
to cash in too.

21:11.283 --> 21:13.843
- Cash in on what?
- His start-up.

21:14.019 --> 21:16.852
I wanted him to share the wealth.
It only seemed fair.

21:17.022 --> 21:19.081
I helped him work out those bugs
in the past.

21:19.257 --> 21:22.056
Hang on a second.
His company can barely stay afloat.

21:22.594 --> 21:24.619
Then why'd the Navy let him out
early?

21:26.832 --> 21:29.062
What does that have to do
with anything?

21:30.302 --> 21:33.397
When a person in the military
comes into a lot of money,

21:33.572 --> 21:36.064
they can get permission to leave.
It's felt that their service

21:36.241 --> 21:38.073
is no longer a first priority.

21:38.243 --> 21:39.472
Wait, that's an actual thing?

21:40.846 --> 21:43.042
It's an unwritten thing.

21:43.448 --> 21:45.678
And it probably explains
why Garrett's naval records

21:45.851 --> 21:47.611
didn't give a reason
for his early discharge.

21:47.752 --> 21:50.221
But you said that Garrett's company
hasn't made any money.

21:50.388 --> 21:53.380
- Right.
- It's about to.

21:53.558 --> 21:57.586
We were out celebrating
when I asked him to be a part of it.

21:58.663 --> 22:01.189
He got really condescending.

22:01.566 --> 22:03.330
And I guess I got a little worked up.

22:04.302 --> 22:06.168
How much money
are we talking about?

22:06.505 --> 22:08.496
Seventy-five million dollars?

22:08.673 --> 22:11.199
I got a bad feeling about this.

22:12.811 --> 22:15.803
I'm sorry. I missed it.
The wire transfer was still pending.

22:15.981 --> 22:17.621
It just went through
about 20 minutes ago.

22:17.749 --> 22:20.150
Same time they were expecting
the kidnappers to call back.

22:20.318 --> 22:23.652
- Where did the money come from?
- Songshaw Holdings.

22:23.822 --> 22:26.223
It's a venture capital firm
out of Hong Kong.

22:26.391 --> 22:27.859
Or at least that's where it starts.

22:28.026 --> 22:31.519
The more I dig, the bigger it gets
and the more far east it goes.

22:32.097 --> 22:33.292
Right into mainland China.

22:33.565 --> 22:36.626
ReduceQ's app is not worth a fraction
of $75 million.

22:36.801 --> 22:39.361
Only thing worth that much
is what Garrett designed for the Navy.

22:39.638 --> 22:42.073
The Chinese government
could be behind this.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.504
They create a shell company,
make a VC investment,

22:44.809 --> 22:47.642
when, really, they're paying
for Garrett's naval intelligence.

22:47.812 --> 22:50.474
So why kidnap Robin?
Why not just buy the technology?

22:50.649 --> 22:52.481
Because maybe Garrett
figured it out.

22:53.285 --> 22:55.117
He's a businessman.
He's not a traitor.

22:55.287 --> 22:58.086
I don't believe he would knowingly
sell out his own country.

22:58.256 --> 23:00.315
Grab Robin to make sure
he goes through with it.

23:00.892 --> 23:04.487
That would explain why the kidnappers
haven't made another ransom call.

23:04.663 --> 23:05.892
They've already been in touch.

23:06.631 --> 23:11.330
So if Garrett now has the money,

23:11.503 --> 23:16.942
does that mean the Chinese
now have our drone technology?

23:21.246 --> 23:22.338
I see.

23:22.714 --> 23:25.183
I'll alert SECNAV.

23:26.818 --> 23:29.310
Told you I had a bad feeling
about this.

23:39.897 --> 23:42.264
All right, Nell. Thanks.
We're headed up now.

23:42.433 --> 23:44.313
She's skimming the surface
of Garrett's servers,

23:44.468 --> 23:45.748
but it looks like we were right.

23:45.903 --> 23:48.565
He was at least discussing the drones
with Songshaw Holdings.

23:48.872 --> 23:50.806
I hate it when we're right.

23:50.975 --> 23:53.603
I'm not convinced
they're gonna let Robin go.

23:55.279 --> 23:58.214
Once they grabbed the girl,
they could trade her for the technology.

23:58.382 --> 24:00.373
There's no need to pay him.

24:00.684 --> 24:02.209
Well, maybe the money
keeps him quiet.

24:02.386 --> 24:03.945
Seventy-five million dollars?

24:04.121 --> 24:05.384
That's a lot of quiet.

24:06.023 --> 24:07.354
What do they gain by keeping her?

24:07.524 --> 24:10.516
Once they've got what they wanted,
she's no leverage. She's a liability.

24:11.328 --> 24:12.955
It's almost like we're working
two cases.

24:13.130 --> 24:14.393
That's true.

24:14.865 --> 24:17.960
Either way, he neglected to mention
his recent cash flow to federal agents.

24:18.135 --> 24:21.799
I get the feeling there's a lot of things
this guy neglected to mention.

24:24.842 --> 24:26.003
What have you got?

24:26.176 --> 24:28.896
We've been monitoring Garrett's
phone for a call from the kidnappers,

24:29.046 --> 24:30.411
expecting them to call today.

24:30.581 --> 24:32.413
Which they did,
or they wanted us to believe

24:32.583 --> 24:34.263
that they did
from that warehouse downtown.

24:34.752 --> 24:38.655
But if the kidnappers had already been
in touch with Garrett like you think...

24:38.822 --> 24:41.314
Then there would be evidence
of earlier calls.

24:41.492 --> 24:42.516
Exactly.

24:42.693 --> 24:45.924
So I trolled
through all his recent phone records

24:46.096 --> 24:47.495
looking for new numbers,

24:47.665 --> 24:52.398
specifically anything that looked
like a burn phone. Et voila.

24:55.139 --> 24:57.938
It's only been used to make 13 calls
in the last few days,

24:58.108 --> 25:00.348
- all of them to Garrett.
- Nicely done. Where is it now?

25:00.511 --> 25:02.912
Thank you.
That I do not know. It is turned off.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.980
- Can you switch it on remotely?
- No, I cannot.

25:05.149 --> 25:06.583
But I can show you where it's been.

25:08.185 --> 25:10.779
And that is all within a mile
of where Robin was grabbed.

25:11.255 --> 25:13.349
Tell Sam and Callen
we're gonna go canvass the area.

25:13.524 --> 25:15.515
- Will do. Thank you, Deeks.
- Good work.

25:17.227 --> 25:20.060
You boys thinking of how
you're gonna spend your 75 million?

25:20.230 --> 25:23.689
I was just trying to convince him that
there's good chance Robin's still alive.

25:24.501 --> 25:26.868
- Is there?
- I believe the correct answer was,

25:27.037 --> 25:30.132
- "What $75 million?"
- What are you talking about?

25:30.307 --> 25:33.106
I'm afraid the time
for you playing stupid has expired.

25:33.277 --> 25:34.335
Songshaw Holdings?

25:34.511 --> 25:38.948
The venture capital firm that just wired
ReduceQ $75 million this morning?

25:39.116 --> 25:43.110
That's a lot of money to find out what
the, uh, line is like at Panda Express.

25:43.754 --> 25:45.188
We'd like to speak to our lawyer.

25:45.356 --> 25:48.018
Oh, yeah? Well, you better find one
that specializes in treason

25:48.192 --> 25:51.025
because you sold proprietary
Navy technology to our enemies.

25:53.330 --> 25:55.992
- Hey, we didn't know.
- No, you don't have to talk to them.

25:56.166 --> 25:57.258
No, he's right. You don't.

25:57.434 --> 25:58.526
But you should.

25:58.702 --> 26:01.330
We may be the last chance for you
to see your girlfriend alive.

26:03.841 --> 26:06.742
They wanted us to design
affordable drone technology

26:06.910 --> 26:08.935
for developing countries
to help with everything

26:09.113 --> 26:13.277
from farming
to environmental management,

26:15.419 --> 26:18.616
but they kept asking us
to modify our design specs.

26:18.789 --> 26:21.690
Eventually, it became clear
they were trying to appropriate

26:21.859 --> 26:24.191
our technology
for military application.

26:24.361 --> 26:25.419
So, what did you do?

26:25.596 --> 26:28.258
We said no
and they kidnapped his girlfriend.

26:28.866 --> 26:31.426
So let me get this right.
You handed over Navy secrets,

26:31.602 --> 26:34.902
and they handed over $75 million
but decided to keep your girlfriend?

26:35.072 --> 26:37.063
But they said
that they would release her

26:37.241 --> 26:39.039
once they verified the technology.

26:39.209 --> 26:42.668
They also told you they were gonna
use the technology to help farmers.

26:42.846 --> 26:44.814
Where'd you send it?

26:45.048 --> 26:46.607
We didn't.

26:46.784 --> 26:48.183
It was over two terabytes.

26:48.352 --> 26:50.286
They were probably scared
we were gonna track it.

26:50.454 --> 26:52.218
- We dropped it off in person.
- When?

26:53.257 --> 26:55.157
About 20 minutes
before you got here,

26:55.325 --> 26:58.022
I handed it over to a guy
on the Venice boardwalk.

26:58.195 --> 26:59.856
What did he look like?

27:00.364 --> 27:01.832
Asian teenager.

27:01.999 --> 27:03.763
Kid was on a freaking skateboard.

27:03.934 --> 27:05.265
Callen.

27:05.436 --> 27:08.565
I'm gonna need you to give Miss Jones
the exact location of the handoff.

27:09.406 --> 27:12.774
Kensi and Deeks just found a van that
matches the kidnappers' at a house.

27:12.943 --> 27:15.105
- Did they find Robin?
- Not yet.

27:21.952 --> 27:24.319
Hey.
We can't tell if there's anybody inside,

27:24.488 --> 27:27.008
but based on kidnapping footage,
there should be at least three.

27:27.157 --> 27:29.797
What are the chances this place
is booby-trapped like the last one?

27:29.960 --> 27:33.055
There were no cars at the warehouse
and nobody called us from here.

27:33.230 --> 27:34.664
I don't think they're expecting us.

27:34.832 --> 27:36.561
We still need to be extra careful.

27:36.733 --> 27:38.292
Let's do it.

28:24.014 --> 28:25.573
We got a runner.

28:40.764 --> 28:42.027
What?

28:47.271 --> 28:49.467
He look like a Chinese criminal
to you?

28:49.640 --> 28:50.903
Not even close.

28:51.074 --> 28:52.337
I know what you're thinking.

28:54.478 --> 28:55.758
But that was not risky behavior.

28:55.913 --> 28:57.347
I was about to jump out of the way.

28:59.049 --> 29:01.609
What? I got cat-like reflexes.

29:01.785 --> 29:03.150
You're looking at the jungle cat.

29:03.987 --> 29:05.512
Shut up.

29:08.559 --> 29:09.685
Clear.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.385
- Clear.
- Clear.

29:11.828 --> 29:13.387
Now they got us doing it.

29:13.564 --> 29:15.430
What's the word, Mr. Callen?

29:15.599 --> 29:18.039
We had to take out three shooters,
most likely the kidnappers.

29:18.201 --> 29:19.760
And Robin?

29:20.237 --> 29:21.932
She was here. She's gone now.

29:22.105 --> 29:24.836
- Where do you think they took her?
- They let her go.

29:25.008 --> 29:26.373
Why do you think that, Nell?

29:26.543 --> 29:29.774
Because I'm looking right at her.

29:46.128 --> 29:49.587
You'll all be safer here until
we figure out exactly what's going on.

29:49.765 --> 29:51.563
Can we get you something
to eat or drink?

29:51.734 --> 29:54.169
- No, thanks.
- Could you come with me?

29:56.038 --> 29:58.598
He's just gonna ask her some
questions about what happened.

30:00.176 --> 30:02.440
- I'm fine now, Will.
- Okay.

30:07.049 --> 30:09.848
- Coffee?
- Yeah. Please.

30:10.452 --> 30:12.853
Roger that.
P.C.'s clearing that right now.

30:13.055 --> 30:14.614
Copy that.

30:19.562 --> 30:21.155
You, uh, find anything?

30:21.330 --> 30:23.130
Nothing suggests any of these guys
were linked

30:23.299 --> 30:24.892
to Songshaw Holdings
or mainland China.

30:25.067 --> 30:27.502
What about
Garrett's drone technology?

30:27.670 --> 30:30.401
Nothing yet. Balsam said
he handed it to an Asian teen,

30:30.573 --> 30:32.974
but we didn't find anybody here
fitting that description.

30:33.242 --> 30:34.767
We've been scanning beach cams,

30:34.944 --> 30:37.038
but so far,
we haven't found anything either.

30:37.213 --> 30:40.581
Your dead guys, however,
are a wealth of criminal information.

30:40.749 --> 30:42.581
Everyone has a rap sheet,
covering everything

30:42.751 --> 30:45.152
from B and E's to extortion.

30:45.321 --> 30:49.315
Unfortunately, I can't find anything that
links them to Garrett or the Chinese.

30:49.491 --> 30:51.152
All right. Thanks.

30:51.327 --> 30:55.127
Maybe Nell's found something
on Garrett's servers that will.

30:56.198 --> 30:58.030
Where are we, Miss Jones?

30:58.367 --> 31:00.768
Well, there's a lot of data here
and it's all partitioned

31:00.936 --> 31:02.734
in increasing levels of security,

31:02.905 --> 31:04.805
some of which is proving difficult
to breach.

31:04.974 --> 31:07.170
- So...
- We've connected all our computers

31:07.343 --> 31:08.401
into a Beowulf cluster.

31:08.577 --> 31:11.410
Once you plug in,
you'll be slave to the master.

31:11.580 --> 31:13.344
So to speak.

31:13.515 --> 31:15.506
That sounds great.

31:16.185 --> 31:17.346
Who are these guys?

31:17.519 --> 31:20.113
Uh, Bryce and Fletcher.
They work here.

31:20.289 --> 31:22.257
- I'm Bryce. He's Fletcher.
- Fletcher.

31:22.424 --> 31:24.017
Sorry. Got them mixed up.

31:25.561 --> 31:27.393
Civilians.

31:28.130 --> 31:31.065
Well, keep looking.

31:31.934 --> 31:34.904
Everyone slips up sooner or later.

31:35.671 --> 31:37.571
I'm on it.

31:45.514 --> 31:47.710
I felt something like a bee
sting my back.

31:47.883 --> 31:50.853
The next thing I remember
was waking up on the floor of the van.

31:51.020 --> 31:53.955
My hands were tied
and they had blindfolded me.

31:55.791 --> 31:58.624
I thought they were gonna rape
and kill me.

31:59.428 --> 32:01.920
Oh, come on.
Does she have to do this right now?

32:02.097 --> 32:05.294
The longer we wait, the less likely
we'll recover the technology.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.526
Trust me, you wouldn't want to.

32:07.703 --> 32:09.671
- / thought I was gonna die.
- Why's that?

32:09.838 --> 32:12.273
I embedded a worm
in one of the programs.

32:12.441 --> 32:14.500
It will remain dormant for 36 hours,

32:14.677 --> 32:16.941
after which,
you need to initiate its disable code

32:17.112 --> 32:18.944
or it'll cannibalize everything.

32:20.215 --> 32:22.115
You're just full of surprises.

32:23.519 --> 32:27.547
I envisioned where I wanted to be
and I just prayed on it.

32:27.723 --> 32:29.248
Where was that?

32:30.426 --> 32:34.260
With Will. Imagine my surprise

32:34.430 --> 32:37.229
when they dropped me off
a block away from his office.

32:37.700 --> 32:38.895
They just let you go?

32:40.235 --> 32:45.196
I ran as fast as I could
and here I am.

32:47.977 --> 32:49.411
That's a rough day.

32:52.314 --> 32:54.578
It's all okay in the end.

32:55.951 --> 32:58.852
That's what I tell myself
to get through the hard times.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.119
Are we gonna be okay?

33:04.660 --> 33:06.856
We're gonna do everything we can.

33:07.596 --> 33:09.291
So did you get a good look
at these guys?

33:09.565 --> 33:12.000
They always wore masks
or kept me blindfolded,

33:12.167 --> 33:14.465
so I never really saw their faces.

33:14.803 --> 33:17.329
Did they have any sort of an accent?
Did they smoke?

33:18.307 --> 33:20.332
Did you hear any names,
nicknames, anything?

33:20.509 --> 33:23.945
I think one of them
was Mick or Nick.

33:24.313 --> 33:26.873
They tended to whisper around me.

33:29.184 --> 33:32.051
We might not have to worry
about losing our drone technology.

33:32.221 --> 33:34.155
- Why is that?
- Garrett built in a virus.

33:34.723 --> 33:36.248
He what?

33:36.692 --> 33:38.751
He built in a virus.

33:38.927 --> 33:40.156
It was to protect you.

33:40.929 --> 33:42.454
What if they had found it?

33:42.998 --> 33:46.024
Well, obviously, they didn't,
or you might not be here.

33:46.435 --> 33:48.301
But what happens when they do?

33:48.470 --> 33:51.269
I mean, they paid $75 million
for that technology.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.670
We'll never be safe now.

33:55.177 --> 33:56.804
As long as you're here, you're safe.

33:59.048 --> 34:00.641
Be right back.

34:04.753 --> 34:06.983
I was only trying to protect her.

34:07.289 --> 34:08.415
She's just upset.

34:08.724 --> 34:11.386
Yeah, but she's right.
They're gonna want their money back.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.755
Did you tell Robin
the deal was for $75 million?

34:14.063 --> 34:15.690
Yeah. She knew.

34:15.864 --> 34:18.889
We were gonna take an extended
vacation once it was put to bed.

34:20.369 --> 34:21.859
You can go back in with her.

34:22.271 --> 34:23.705
Thanks.

34:31.447 --> 34:35.042
Robin, are you okay? I'm sorry...

34:35.217 --> 34:36.581
- Kens.
- What's up?

34:36.752 --> 34:38.186
I need you two to switch gears.

34:38.454 --> 34:40.581
Find out everything you can
on Robin Henson.

34:40.755 --> 34:42.315
Onit.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.449
Robin. Of course.

34:45.928 --> 34:47.396
Okay.

34:49.264 --> 34:51.255
There it is.

34:59.608 --> 35:00.905
Would you like an espresso?

35:01.076 --> 35:02.601
I make it from scratch.

35:03.645 --> 35:04.908
I'm okay. Thank you.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.447
Do you like kombucha?
It's better than caffeine.

35:08.717 --> 35:09.741
Sometimes.

35:12.821 --> 35:15.347
Eric. What are you doing here?

35:15.524 --> 35:19.085
Hetty thought you could use another
set of hands, from a professional.

35:19.495 --> 35:23.898
Eric Beale.
Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

35:24.066 --> 35:25.431
Oh, my God.

35:26.935 --> 35:28.664
Are you two partners?

35:29.671 --> 35:31.139
- Not really.
- Yes.

35:32.708 --> 35:33.732
- Sometimes.
- Sort of.

35:35.277 --> 35:38.611
- It's classified.
- So where's your gun?

35:39.982 --> 35:42.610
No, no, he doesn't need one.

35:45.154 --> 35:46.747
That's right.

35:51.059 --> 35:53.619
I could kill you with my pen.

36:02.104 --> 36:03.731
What you got?

36:04.573 --> 36:06.337
Not much.

36:06.808 --> 36:08.298
Robin...

36:08.810 --> 36:11.711
- I had to.
- She looks more angry than upset.

36:12.214 --> 36:15.013
- No, you didn't.
- What have you got, Kens?

36:15.184 --> 36:18.415
We originally identified Robin
from her California driver's license.

36:18.587 --> 36:20.868
Once we linked her to Garrett,
we didn't look any further.

36:21.023 --> 36:23.617
Not that it would've mattered,
Robin is completely backstopped.

36:23.792 --> 36:26.454
Problem is, so is Kim Harris,
and before that, Kate Miller.

36:26.628 --> 36:28.468
She got a police record
that goes back 11 years

36:28.630 --> 36:30.590
links her to two of the guys we shot
at the house.

36:31.033 --> 36:33.092
She's been running a long con
on Garrett.

36:33.268 --> 36:37.330
- To the tune of $75 million.
- Thanks, guys.

36:38.207 --> 36:39.231
- You're welcome.
- Yup.

36:39.408 --> 36:41.288
She knew Garrett was running
a software start-up

36:41.443 --> 36:43.571
and he was an expert
in naval drone technology.

36:43.879 --> 36:47.042
Perfect cover and an easy target.

36:47.216 --> 36:49.014
No wonder she's angry.

36:49.184 --> 36:52.313
By trying to save her,
he screwed her with the Chinese.

36:52.821 --> 36:55.415
I'm surprised
she hasn't asked to leave.

36:55.924 --> 36:58.325
- She gotta be getting a little antsy.
- I can't help you.

37:02.931 --> 37:05.195
It's gonna be fine, I already...

37:05.367 --> 37:07.995
So, what's next?

37:09.137 --> 37:10.195
Jail.

37:10.472 --> 37:11.530
What?

37:11.707 --> 37:14.699
No, I refused to sell them
the technology.

37:14.876 --> 37:17.072
I only handed it over
after they kidnapped Robin

37:17.246 --> 37:19.908
- and I sabotaged it.
- We know that.

37:20.315 --> 37:22.374
You're not going to jail.

37:22.551 --> 37:24.883
- Shes.
- No.

37:25.754 --> 37:31.124
- Robin?
- Or Kim Harris, Kate Miller.

37:31.793 --> 37:33.633
She's a con artist
with a long criminal record.

37:33.795 --> 37:35.915
Targeted you, got close to you,
she earned your trust.

37:36.231 --> 37:38.427
- No.
- Tell him.

37:39.001 --> 37:40.560
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.898
You introduced him
to Songshaw Holdings.

37:43.071 --> 37:44.937
No, that wasn't Robin's deal.

37:45.107 --> 37:47.576
- That was Oscar's deal.
- Don't say anything else.

37:47.743 --> 37:49.541
I want a lawyer.

37:51.780 --> 37:53.407
She and Oscar
were working together.

37:54.549 --> 37:57.109
She worked the bedroom
while Oscar worked the boardroom.

37:57.619 --> 37:59.219
Now the only thing standing
between Oscar

37:59.388 --> 38:01.254
and getting away with $75 million...

38:01.723 --> 38:02.952
Is Nell.

38:05.661 --> 38:08.631
- Hello?
- Nell, you still at Garrett's office?

38:08.797 --> 38:10.094
Yeah, I'm with Eric.

38:10.265 --> 38:12.597
Hey, listen,
is Oscar Balsam still there?

38:14.169 --> 38:16.729
Yes.
It looks like he's getting ready to leave.

38:16.905 --> 38:19.806
- Do not let him leave, understand?
- Got it.

38:24.813 --> 38:27.942
Excuse me, Mr. Balsam, uh,
Special Agents Callen and Hanna

38:28.116 --> 38:29.982
are on their way back
to ask you few questions.

38:30.152 --> 38:33.952
- I'm running out for a few minutes.
- Okay, they asked if you'd stay here.

38:34.122 --> 38:36.853
- I'll be back.
- I can't let you leave.

38:37.626 --> 38:40.186
- Well, you can't stop me.
- Yes, I can.

38:41.396 --> 38:43.763
Dude, you got to listen to her.

38:45.801 --> 38:48.293
Fine, but this is ridiculous.

38:48.837 --> 38:50.396
Fair enough.

38:54.142 --> 38:56.372
- Nell.
- I'm okay. I'm all right.

39:00.849 --> 39:02.681
I'll call Callen.

39:17.466 --> 39:19.161
Hey, stop!

39:27.075 --> 39:28.873
Put the bag down.

39:29.478 --> 39:31.879
Turn around. Keep your hands up.

39:40.722 --> 39:42.588
- Well done.
- Thanks.

39:42.924 --> 39:44.915
We'll have to let you out
a little more often.

39:45.193 --> 39:47.025
Nice work, partner.

39:47.496 --> 39:49.225
She's my partner.

39:55.203 --> 39:56.796
- Good?
- Yeah.

39:56.972 --> 39:58.940
- Nice work.
- It's good.

40:06.581 --> 40:08.208
Hey, girl.

40:08.383 --> 40:10.317
- Heard you got some moves.
- Good, yo.

40:10.485 --> 40:13.978
- Well done, Miss Jones, Mr. Beale.
- Thank you.

40:14.156 --> 40:16.488
We should probably have
an operational debriefing.

40:16.658 --> 40:18.956
No reason why we couldn't do that
over a cold beer or two.

40:19.127 --> 40:20.458
- Sam?
- Yes, please.

40:20.629 --> 40:22.097
- Grab our stuff?
- Yeah, okay.

40:22.264 --> 40:23.390
Hetty, you in?

40:23.565 --> 40:25.932
Oh, sounds great.

40:32.407 --> 40:34.205
Give me some sugar.

40:34.910 --> 40:37.106
- Heh.
- What? No?

40:40.449 --> 40:43.475
- Key for your motorcycle.
- Ugh.

40:43.652 --> 40:47.919
You can donate your organs
after you finish working for us.

40:48.089 --> 40:50.387
Listen, I understand there's a rule,

40:50.559 --> 40:53.256
but I just got her,
and she's so beautiful.

40:54.062 --> 40:56.258
And you don't care.

40:56.431 --> 40:59.093
I hope you're all very happy
about this.

40:59.267 --> 41:00.996
And just for the record, ahem,

41:01.703 --> 41:03.467
this sucks.

41:05.507 --> 41:07.441
Noted, Mr. Deeks.

41:08.477 --> 41:11.208
Duly noted.
