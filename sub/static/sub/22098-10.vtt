WEBVTT

00:21.772 --> 00:24.273
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.025
APOLLO:
Gives me the creeps

00:26.110 --> 00:28.695
seeing him acting like that
with her...

00:28.779 --> 00:30.905
How can one of us get that
roped in by one of them?

00:31.407 --> 00:32.782
Look, Chief,

00:32.866 --> 00:35.535
I know how she felt about you.
She loved you.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.329
You know what, I should
probably be grateful to you.

00:38.414 --> 00:40.748
Because that freak in her
belly could've been mine.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.542
Do you have
actual memories

00:42.626 --> 00:44.877
of being with the Chief
before the Cylon attack?

00:44.962 --> 00:48.673
You're the father of my child.
You're the first in my heart.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.800
And nothing is ever
gonna change that.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.885
All right, here's the deal.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.471
We are gonna build
a new fighter.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.975
Blackbird test flight,
cleared for launch.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.481
Galactica, Apollo.
I've lost her.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.611
Of course, you lost contact. It's
a damn stealth ship, remember?

01:14.658 --> 01:16.743
The resistance base camp
is here.

01:16.827 --> 01:20.413
Three hundred clicks north of the
only Cylon airbase in the area.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.374
We can drop seven Raptors straight
down through the Martok Valley

01:23.459 --> 01:27.211
and be in and out before the Cylons
have a chance to launch their Raiders.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.088
The Raptors return
the Galactica

01:29.173 --> 01:31.716
with the resistance fighters,
we jump the hell out of there.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.842
Simple.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.385
Where's the Fleet?

01:34.470 --> 01:36.554
The Fleet will remain here.

01:36.889 --> 01:40.349
I've tasked seven Vipers and
one Raptor to stay with them.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.642
Seven Vipers?

01:41.727 --> 01:43.269
And one Raptor.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.063
Lieutenant,

01:47.357 --> 01:48.858
how many jumps

01:49.401 --> 01:52.695
will it take Galactica
to reach Caprica?

01:53.864 --> 01:55.364
241.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.034
241?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.869
That's conservative.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.038
And you know it.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.208
Once you jump the Red Line,

02:05.292 --> 02:07.168
navigational error creeps into

02:07.252 --> 02:09.462
every single jump calculation
that you make.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.964
It could take us
twice that amount of time

02:12.049 --> 02:14.801
to actually find Caprica,
let alone land.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.180
I understand the risks.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.473
ADAMA: Do you really?

02:20.557 --> 02:22.141
We have to try.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.061
Lieutenant, I respect
what you're trying to do here.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.145
However...

02:26.230 --> 02:28.815
We have a duty
to the people we left behind.

02:28.899 --> 02:29.941
I understand that.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.819
We have to find a way to jump
back to Caprica and go get the...

02:32.903 --> 02:34.028
Kara.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.155
(ALARM BUZZING)

02:36.240 --> 02:39.492
GAETA: Action stations, action stations.
Set Condition One throughout the ship.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.578
This is not a drill. Repeat.
Action stations, action stations.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.497
Set Condition One
throughout the ship.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.873
ADAMA: Well,
Madam President,

02:45.958 --> 02:48.459
looks like you picked
a hell of a day for a visit.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.419
This is the commander.
Sitrep.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.880
Bogey just jumped into
dradis range, CBDR.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.007
From the size of it, it's
probably a Cylon base ship.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.884
CAP's on its way
to intercept.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.387
Alert the Fleet
to an emergency jump.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.138
I'm on my way
with the President.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.858
Galactica, Apollo, I'm outbound
on course to the Base Star.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.317
Tag alongside me.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.194
I estimate one minute
till I intercept.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.571
DUALLA:
Roger that, Apollo.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.364
Be advised,
alert fighters have launched

03:18.448 --> 03:20.867
and will take station
on your six in three minutes.

03:20.951 --> 03:21.951
Sitrep.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.995
Alert fighters
have launched.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.330
New dradis contact,
they're launching Raiders.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.916
How long till we jump?

03:29.001 --> 03:30.418
Another two minutes.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.586
Sir?

03:32.462 --> 03:35.172
Sir, I'm getting
Colonial transponders.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.176
Colonial?

03:39.261 --> 03:42.513
Hell, now they're using
our own signals against us.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.308
Maybe.

03:47.019 --> 03:50.021
Weapons hold.
Hold the jump, too.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.651
Something up your sleeve,
I take it?

03:56.278 --> 03:58.738
All ships, Galactica,
hold jump.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.115
Say again, hold jump.

04:02.743 --> 04:06.245
Ship to ship,
Colonial priority one channel.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.664
Send hostile challenge
and ID.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.791
And put your reply
up on the speakers.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.377
DUALLA: Attention,
unknown vessel.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.212
This is
the Battlestar Galactica.

04:15.297 --> 04:18.132
Identify yourself
or we will fire upon you.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.344
Range now 1,700, sir.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.600
MAN: This is
the Battlestar Pegasus

04:27.684 --> 04:31.228
to the ship claiming to be
the Galactica. Please respond.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.273
Pegasus? How could that be?

04:34.358 --> 04:36.651
The entire fleet
was destroyed.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.697
Give me direct contact.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.371
Pegasus,
this is Galactica actual.

04:49.331 --> 04:52.875
Authenticate identity with
recognition codes immediately.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.544
Sir.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.839
I'm receiving
Colonial recognition codes.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.300
They're authentic.

05:04.388 --> 05:07.056
CAIN: Galactica,
this is Pegasus actual.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.559
Adama, is that you?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.020
Admiral Cain.

05:18.527 --> 05:21.028
What a pleasure
to hear your voice.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.952
Disengage.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.205
Red Team, disengage.
Red Team, disengage.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.709
CAIN: Commander,

05:36.920 --> 05:38.921
I don't know what to say.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.508
This is a miracle.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.222
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.434
Step down to Condition One
throughout the Fleet.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.311
APOLLO: Galactica Apollo,
you are not going to believe

05:54.396 --> 05:56.564
what I'm looking at
out here.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.691
It's like a dream.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.424
It is a dream.

07:27.364 --> 07:30.199
MAN: (ON WIRELESS)
Pegasus Raptor 861, Galactica.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.494
Skids down, mag secure.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.038
TIGH: This is a stroke of luck
like you read about.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.581
We could use a little luck right now.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.125
Can't argue that.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.709
You know this
Admiral Cain?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.044
Only heard about her.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.255
But she's a very young officer
on a very fast track.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.714
She's very smart.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.383
Very tough.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.759
Very well-connected.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.803
Fleet promoted her
to rear admiral

07:50.887 --> 07:52.596
over half the commanders
on the list.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.014
TIGH: What the hell
is this, a party?

07:54.099 --> 07:55.141
CALLY: Sorry, sir.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.225
All clear the deck.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.686
Oh, Colonel, let it go.
It's a big moment. Come on.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.066
(ALL CLAMORING)

08:15.036 --> 08:16.579
Get into ranks,
people!

08:17.581 --> 08:21.000
Look sharp.
This isn't recess!

08:21.084 --> 08:24.420
Come on, the landing party
is here. Dress and cover.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.846
Nice of you to show up.
Couldn't get here too early.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.599
Group, attention!

09:40.163 --> 09:43.332
Admiral Cain, welcome
aboard the Galactica.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.877
Commander Adama,

09:49.089 --> 09:50.547
it's an honor.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.802
Colonel,
put your men at ease.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.178
At ease.

10:01.351 --> 10:05.604
Allow me to present to you the
President of the Colonies, Laura Roslin.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.317
It's a long story. Welcome.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.822
Madam President,
pleasure.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.536
Dr. Baltar?

10:21.246 --> 10:22.329
Yes.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.208
It's good to see you.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.175
On behalf of the officers
and the crew of the Pegasus,

10:36.553 --> 10:38.554
it's a pleasure
to see all of you.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.016
Welcome back
to the Colonial Fleet.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.642
(ALL CHEERING)

11:03.496 --> 11:05.039
Captain Taylor.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.082
Kara Thrace.
Captain Taylor.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.670
Sorry about all of this.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.048
No, it's so good
to see you.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.732
To the 12 Colonies.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.363
It's good
to have you aboard.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.660
Good stuff.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.537
One of my last bottles.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.872
Admiral.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.375
I'm fairly burning
with questions.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.377
I hope you don't mind
if I just dive in.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.712
Please.
How did you find us?

11:56.216 --> 11:59.051
Well, we were tracking
a Cylon fleet.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.719
We were trying to predict
their movements,

12:00.804 --> 12:03.055
which seemed
rather random initially.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.892
Until we realized that they were just
jumping to systems with natural resources.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.270
So, we began to scout
those systems ourselves,

12:10.897 --> 12:14.024
hoping to carry out hit-and-run
attacks on their fleet.

12:15.819 --> 12:19.238
But instead of finding
the Cylons, we found you.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.782
So, you've been
attacking their fleet?

12:22.117 --> 12:25.202
Well, you know what they say
about the best defense.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.454
Hmm.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.582
How did you avoid the initial
Cylon attack on the Colonies?

12:32.627 --> 12:34.420
I'll have another
if you don't mind.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.550
Galactica's finest.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.304
(EXHALES)

12:45.723 --> 12:48.142
Beats the hell out of the
nickel tour. Thank you.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.978
I figured if you'd seen one old
Battlestar, you'd seen them all.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.188
Yeah, well,
she's an old one.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.732
I can't believe the Cylons
didn't kick your ass

12:55.817 --> 12:58.402
up one side and down
the other in this bucket.

13:01.656 --> 13:02.823
Sorry.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.327
I'm sorry. No one gets to
insult your ship except you.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.872
You're Gods damn right.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.085
And just for that

13:18.715 --> 13:20.466
you have to skip this round.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.177
(LAUGHING)

13:26.681 --> 13:29.892
We were docking
at Scorpion Fleet Shipyard.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.646
We were getting ready to go in
for a three-month overhaul.

13:34.731 --> 13:39.234
Most of the crew was getting ready for
extended shore leave and family reunions.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.903
XO had the deck.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.239
I was down in my quarters,
wrapping up some paperwork

13:44.324 --> 13:47.576
and getting ready to pack up
to go home to Tauron.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.664
And that's when
the Cylons attacked.

13:52.749 --> 13:57.002
They hit the shipyard
with three, maybe four nukes.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.381
Five ships.
Two of them Battlestars.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.177
They were destroyed
right there.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.847
And luckily,
very luckily,

14:10.558 --> 14:14.561
the blast blinded
the Cylon dradis.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.148
So they were unable to determine
that we were still intact.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.235
But there were...
There were explosions,

14:21.319 --> 14:23.445
and fires
in the launch bays,

14:24.906 --> 14:26.990
and fuel and ordnance
igniting,

14:28.034 --> 14:29.660
people screaming.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.792
And by the time
I got back to CIC,

14:37.585 --> 14:40.462
I discovered that
I'd lost over 700 men.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.340
My Gods.

14:44.968 --> 14:48.220
We were completely defenseless,
so I ordered a jump.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.973
To where?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.683
Wherever.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.686
Nowhere. Just jump.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.314
ADAMA: Blind jump.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.235
Could've ended up anywhere.
Gutsy call.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.654
No. Desperate move.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.907
Didn't see any other choice.

15:08.992 --> 15:12.744
How'd you avoid the Cylons
infiltrating your computer system?

15:15.248 --> 15:19.209
Well, our networks were off-line
in preparation for the overhaul.

15:22.046 --> 15:25.215
Yes, Pegasus has always been
a rather lucky ship.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.883
To lucky ships.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.643
I'm sure you have

15:37.937 --> 15:39.771
quite a story
to tell as well.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.065
But I won't make you go through
it right this very minute.

15:42.817 --> 15:46.862
You can send up your logs
when you get the chance.

15:47.697 --> 15:48.947
Yes, sir.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.704
CAIN: Is something wrong?

15:57.206 --> 15:58.248
No.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.586
I sometimes forget about the
rules of military protocol.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.257
ADAMA: Admiral Cain
is my superior officer.

16:07.342 --> 16:10.594
She will take complete command
of the entire Fleet.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.348
I was wondering
how to broach that topic.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.808
Trust me when I say

16:16.893 --> 16:19.853
that while the chain of command
is strict, it is not heartless.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.314
And neither am I.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.816
This is your ship.

16:24.984 --> 16:29.196
And I have no desire to interfere
with Galactica's internal affairs.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.782
I appreciate it, Admiral.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.079
Madam President, you look
like I just shot your dog.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.497
No, I just...

16:38.581 --> 16:41.416
Just the Commander and I,
we've been through a lot.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.419
Excuse me.
Madam President?

16:50.093 --> 16:52.177
If you'll both
excuse me.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.391
Admiral, I can't tell you how
grateful we are to have you here.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.519
Thank you for finding us.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.440
Madam President.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.950
The Secretary
of Education?

17:18.329 --> 17:20.205
She's come a long way.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.626
I'm sure.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.879
So tell me
about Admiral Cain.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.966
Officer's discretion.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.926
Of course.

17:33.261 --> 17:37.848
We were going after what we thought
was a little Cylon comm relay.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.226
Easy target, right?

17:41.644 --> 17:45.021
Turns out it wasn't a comm relay
at all. It was a staging area

17:45.106 --> 17:47.524
full of 15 squadrons
of Raiders.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.984
(EXCLAIMS)

17:49.652 --> 17:52.946
Admiral Cain ordered
our XO to attack.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.824
Those two were real close.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.826
He'd served with her
for years.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.829
But here's the thing.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.293
He refused the order.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.044
No frakking way.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.255
There's one other matter.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.510
We have a Cylon prisoner
aboard this ship.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.845
Really?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.515
We have one
on ours as well.

18:20.683 --> 18:24.352
Ours has proven to be an
excellent source of intelligence.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.148
She's been very cooperative.

18:28.357 --> 18:32.068
The Vice President, Dr. Baltar,
has been working with her.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.988
You're very lucky
to have him onboard.

18:35.490 --> 18:36.865
Very lucky.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.075
TIGH:
What did she do?

18:39.160 --> 18:40.994
She asked for his gun.

18:41.204 --> 18:44.498
Shot him in the head with it
in front of the whole crew.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.294
And then she turned to me.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.215
What did you do?

18:54.717 --> 18:58.428
Then I ordered the frakking
attack, what do you think I did?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.973
(LAUGHING)

19:03.142 --> 19:04.142
No.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.815
No, no. I'm just joking.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.067
I'm just kidding, you know.

19:12.735 --> 19:13.735
Huh?

19:17.031 --> 19:18.240
No, no.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.866
Hey.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.410
Set us up again,
will you?

19:25.081 --> 19:27.916
We haven't been able to get
anything useful out of our Cylon.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.710
I'd like to set up an appointment
with Dr. Baltar as soon as possible.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.087
Yes, sir.

19:33.798 --> 19:37.092
It gives me no pleasure
to have to take command, Bill.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.219
I want you to know that.

19:39.303 --> 19:42.055
Don't give it
a moment's thought, Admiral.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.605
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:10.668 --> 20:12.127
(CHATTERING)

20:14.922 --> 20:16.798
Is this a scorecard?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.886
You guys put scorecards
on the side of your ships?

20:20.970 --> 20:22.345
Like you don't keep score.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.222
You don't see me
painting them on the side

20:24.307 --> 20:26.391
like I'm bragging to the
whole frakking universe.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.602
That's 48 kills
right there.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.355
That's special. Do you
have caps and T-shirts, too?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.815
(LAUGHING)

20:36.861 --> 20:38.695
Where's the Galactica CAG?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.615
Right here.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.080
Let's hear the rundown on this
squadron of yours, Captain.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.715
I see you don't keep track of
your kills. You should start.

20:59.342 --> 21:03.386
Encourages morale, gets the
competition going, esprit de corps.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.263
Well, that's one philosophy.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.475
It's Admiral Cain's
philosophy.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.894
That means it's your
philosophy now, Captain.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.939
The name of my commander
is Adama.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.524
It should be pretty easy to
remember, 'cause it's my name.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.026
Yeah.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.655
I'll keep that in mind,
daddy's boy.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.200
Let's see
your ordnance lists.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.759
I can never get over
how human they look.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.892
Yes. It's uncanny, isn't it?

21:52.478 --> 21:54.938
This model has been
very useful, in fact.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.731
It's given us
key insights into

21:56.816 --> 22:00.986
Cylon information systems,
tactics, strategic plans.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.571
I take it we've encountered
another Colonial warship.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.787
You've gotten all of this
intel without coercion?

22:10.871 --> 22:12.414
BALTAR: Oh, yes.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.040
I find the application

22:14.125 --> 22:16.918
of physical or coercive techniques
to be counter-productive.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.586
You're going to ignore me.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.547
Pretend I can't speak.

22:22.508 --> 22:26.928
We treat this model as if it's
the human being it pretends to be.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.265
That seems to make it
more cooperative.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.036
BALTAR: I haven't shown
you the lab, have I?

22:51.120 --> 22:53.371
So with the background in
physics, and computer programming,

22:53.456 --> 22:55.206
they made me head
of the Cylon branch

22:55.291 --> 22:57.459
and my main focus
is on Cylon detection.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.544
We have our own
Cylon prisoner.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.546
I'd like you to examine it
as soon as possible.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.548
See if you can
glean anything from it.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.800
I wonder who the Cylon
will turn out to be?

23:05.885 --> 23:08.178
A stranger,
a familiar face,

23:08.846 --> 23:11.389
a trusted friend who suddenly
turns out to be the enemy?

23:11.474 --> 23:13.058
Did you hear
what I just said?

23:13.142 --> 23:14.517
Yes, yes.

23:14.810 --> 23:18.271
I'd be really... I'd be very
happy to examine the prisoner.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.857
Commander.

23:21.025 --> 23:23.318
Admiral.
Admiral. I am so sorry.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.988
We haven't been able to get
anything useful out of it.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.365
Perhaps
you'll have better luck.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.493
She's a hard case,
isn't she?

23:31.577 --> 23:33.078
Just your type, Gaius.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.622
You do have a thing for
strong, powerful women.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.165
Yes, I do.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.752
I'll do my best, sir.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.640
Sounds like
you were both drunk.

23:53.724 --> 23:54.933
TIGH: No question.

23:55.017 --> 23:57.644
But he wasn't lying.
I can tell you that right now.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.646
Well, I hope you won't
jump to conclusions.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.231
Wait for all the facts.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.691
Context matters.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.986
Context?

24:08.697 --> 24:12.158
That woman shot an officer
right in front of the crew.

24:12.243 --> 24:15.370
We shot down
an entire civilian transport

24:15.871 --> 24:18.289
with over a thousand people
onboard.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.250
Says so right there.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.043
That was
completely different.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.546
And we don't know there were
people on that ship.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.131
Which is why I hope

24:26.215 --> 24:28.383
the Admiral reads
the complete log

24:28.509 --> 24:30.468
and understands the context.

24:31.262 --> 24:33.972
We should ask Admiral Cain
for her logs.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.015
Just so we can
put her in context.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.142
(CHUCKLES)

24:37.226 --> 24:39.102
Wouldn't that be nice.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.313
TYROL: Cally, get a wrench.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.191
Thanks.

24:45.693 --> 24:48.319
Chief. Chief,
take a look at this.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.036
Are these spare parts?

24:58.622 --> 25:01.958
"For our fellow knuckledraggers
on the Galactica.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.752
"Courtesy of
the Pegasus Deck Gang. "

25:05.963 --> 25:08.214
Cally, I'm starting to like
that ship.

25:12.636 --> 25:13.636
Lieutenant.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.764
Lieutenant Ferelli.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.309
These are navigational
updates,

25:19.393 --> 25:22.103
software patches
and systems upgrades.

25:22.771 --> 25:26.608
And this is the complete
Pegasus on-board digital library.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.485
Everything from
the Articles of Colonization

25:29.570 --> 25:31.529
to Zarek's trial record.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.491
You did have to erase your
computer memory drives, correct?

25:36.911 --> 25:38.328
Yes, we did.

25:38.787 --> 25:39.787
Thank you.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.122
Thank Admiral Cain.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.708
Got any porn in there?

25:44.126 --> 25:46.669
I've got ships
on half-rations,

25:46.754 --> 25:49.464
and others experiencing
mechanical difficulties.

25:49.548 --> 25:53.676
And so far Galactica is the only
vessel having any of its needs met.

25:54.011 --> 25:58.014
Pegasus has been resupplying
Galactica from it's own reserve

25:58.098 --> 25:59.224
for military operations.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.642
Which I
completely support.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.895
But when will some of these supplies
start getting out to the Fleet?

26:05.481 --> 26:07.482
Admiral Cain
has assured me

26:07.566 --> 26:09.817
that those supplies
are on their way.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.487
Well, at least she's taking
your phone calls.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.489
I can't even get her
to answer mine.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.325
I'll bring it
to her attention.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.705
How are you doing
with all this?

26:23.290 --> 26:24.874
She outranks me.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.001
It's as simple as that.

26:28.629 --> 26:32.006
You know, if President Adar stepped
off that Raptor, I'd be elated.

26:32.633 --> 26:35.718
Grateful to have someone
take over. And yet...

26:37.096 --> 26:39.806
I don't want to go
to the "and yet" part.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.143
I've been taking orders
my entire career.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.562
This is no different.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.316
Well, then, Commander,
thank you.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.112
We would appreciate
all the help you can give us.

26:54.697 --> 26:55.947
You shall receive it.

27:07.668 --> 27:11.421
Twenty-five
opto-electronic transducers.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.340
That's one ugly baby.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.009
Excuse me?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.386
Do you mind if I take
a look around? I'm...

27:18.470 --> 27:20.680
I'm Laird,
Pegasus Deck Chief.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.224
Oh, hey.
Yeah. Tyrol.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.643
Thanks for sending over
these parts.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.937
Yeah, look at
whatever you like.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.231
Specialist Cally.
Hi.

27:32.234 --> 27:35.403
DDG-62's. I'll be...

27:36.530 --> 27:40.158
I designed these engines. I thought
they phased them out over 10 years ago.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.952
You're
an aeronautical engineer?

27:43.037 --> 27:44.454
Yeah, I was.

27:44.872 --> 27:48.124
Then the war happened, and I got drafted
to being the Deck Chief on Pegasus.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.669
So you're really a civilian?
How'd that happen?

27:52.129 --> 27:55.673
I was on the Scylla, and we
got picked up by the Pegasus.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.091
Things happen.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.680
Mind if I crawl around inside here?
I heard you designed this yourself.

28:02.765 --> 28:04.474
I'd love to see
how you did it.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.893
Sure, yeah.
You'll get dirty.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.775
People come
to see my ship.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.881
Don't get too close.
It killed seven of my crew.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.425
You want my guards
to come in with you?

28:39.510 --> 28:41.386
Feeling scared, Gaius?

28:41.804 --> 28:45.431
Want the big, bad soldiers to protect
you from the mean old Cylon prisoner?

28:48.352 --> 28:51.104
No, I think we'll be
just fine. Thank you.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.341
Oh, my God.

29:45.492 --> 29:46.868
NO. 6:
My God, Gaius.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.537
It's me.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.763
Look what
they've done to her.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.101
Open the door.
Now, please.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.692
COMPUTER: ID confirmed.
Lieutenant Thorne.

30:19.776 --> 30:20.776
(GASPS)

30:42.382 --> 30:44.008
She must've struggled.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.636
She must have
fought back.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.222
That doesn't justify this.
Stop it.

30:58.065 --> 30:59.232
Hello.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.780
Hello. Can you hear me?

31:11.578 --> 31:13.704
She's obviously been abused.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.458
Tortured.
Yes.

31:20.796 --> 31:24.465
But there's no obvious sign
of head trauma.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.305
Oh.

31:32.266 --> 31:35.476
Voluntary eye movements
suggest conscious thought.

31:37.104 --> 31:40.398
Can't you stop being
a scientist for one moment

31:42.109 --> 31:44.944
and look at the abused woman
lying there in front of you?

31:51.577 --> 31:53.119
Now, listen up.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.455
I know this must be
very difficult for you.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.374
Don't patronize me.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.210
I'm not patronizing you.
I'm trying to reason with you.

32:01.295 --> 32:04.839
If I'm going to help her, I
have to understand her first.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.592
Will you help her, Gaius?

32:08.468 --> 32:10.595
I will do everything I can.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.473
After all

32:15.976 --> 32:19.478
she is remarkably similar to
someone I care about a great deal.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.026
I think
it would be best

32:27.863 --> 32:30.156
if you left us alone
for a time.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.629
BALTAR: In order
for my technique to work,

32:44.713 --> 32:46.422
the technique
I used so successfully

32:46.506 --> 32:48.674
on the Cylon who called
herself Sharon Valerii,

32:48.759 --> 32:51.802
the prisoner must be
allowed to bathe adequately

32:51.887 --> 32:53.262
and eat.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.807
If proper clothes
could be provided and

32:57.017 --> 32:59.352
other sundry comforts,

32:59.436 --> 33:01.062
then that would be ideal.

33:01.438 --> 33:04.649
The comfort of that thing
is of no interest to me.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.318
It killed over 800 members
of my crew.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.944
If you'll permit me, Admiral,

33:09.029 --> 33:11.530
as I understand it, it
allowed a group of centurions

33:11.615 --> 33:13.783
to board your ship, but
it itself did not commit...

33:13.867 --> 33:16.494
Are you making excuses
for it, Doctor?

33:18.914 --> 33:21.749
Have you become
too close to your subjects?

33:22.042 --> 33:24.043
Lost perspective
perhaps?

33:24.628 --> 33:26.379
Quite the opposite.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.006
The Cylons are a brutal
and deadly opponent,

33:29.091 --> 33:31.175
the universe would be
a substantially better place

33:31.259 --> 33:33.761
if they were
exterminated entirely.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.306
But my job
is not extermination.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.684
My job is investigation.

33:43.105 --> 33:45.690
It doesn't sound like
you're very good at it.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.525
You haven't told me
anything new.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.610
It suffered
no serious head injuries,

33:49.695 --> 33:51.278
and therefore
no physical damage

33:51.363 --> 33:54.699
to its neural pathways or
cognitive reasoning centers.

33:54.783 --> 33:57.243
But it's quite clearly
traumatized.

33:57.828 --> 34:01.997
Which would suggest that its current
condition is psychological in nature.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.250
Had you thought of that?
No.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.003
It shows that the Cylon
consciousness is just as susceptible

34:08.088 --> 34:10.881
to the same pressures and
cleavages as the human psyche

34:10.966 --> 34:13.801
and can be manipulated
in the same fashion.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.638
Simply put, Admiral, you
have already used the stick.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.808
It's time to use a carrot.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.776
Please give the doctor
whatever he needs.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.486
Aye, sir.

34:37.367 --> 34:40.494
Mr. Vice President,
if you'd follow me, please.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.329
Sir.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.832
Lovely ship.
Thank you, sir.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.084
Looks very new.
Yes, sir.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.259
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Commander.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.512
And that I can't offer you
a place to sit.

34:58.889 --> 35:00.765
I've always preferred
to work standing up.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.808
It's much easier
on my back.

35:02.893 --> 35:04.477
And I discovered
meetings with my officers

35:04.561 --> 35:06.270
go faster when they
have to stand as well,

35:06.354 --> 35:08.773
so, out went the chairs.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.526
I'll have to
remember that.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.279
Did you get a chance
to look around the ship?

35:15.781 --> 35:17.031
A little.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.202
It's been a while since
I've been on a Mercury class.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.664
To CIC.

35:28.919 --> 35:32.421
Ship's nearly twice the size,
needs half the crew.

35:32.756 --> 35:35.716
Makes me feel
the Galactica is a relic.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.345
Galactica is not a relic.
It's a classic.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.722
And I, for one, happen to
appreciate the classics.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.308
I've noticed.

35:45.101 --> 35:47.394
You have some
beautiful weapons.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.939
Commander,
having reviewed your logs,

35:50.023 --> 35:53.317
it appears that you've been
through quite an ordeal.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.611
We've had our moments.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.947
You did
yourselves proud.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.574
Thank you, Admiral.

36:01.117 --> 36:05.746
As I told you, we were tracking a
Cylon Fleet when we found Galactica.

36:06.248 --> 36:10.918
And now that I've had a chance to
compare their route to your ship's logs,

36:11.169 --> 36:13.921
it's quite clear that
they've been following you.

36:14.422 --> 36:17.299
Our recon
so far tells us

36:17.759 --> 36:20.344
that the fleet is composed
of two Base Ships,

36:20.428 --> 36:22.847
about a dozen or so
support ships,

36:22.931 --> 36:26.600
and one large vessel that we
are still unable to identify.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.728
It's this large ship here
that I'm interested in.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.858
What's its function? Is it
a command and control ship?

36:33.942 --> 36:35.609
A Raider factory?

36:35.777 --> 36:39.280
Possibly. Whatever it is,
the Cylons are protecting it.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.075
This is what I'd call
a tempting target.

36:47.122 --> 36:50.040
And here I was getting ready
to do a whole song and dance

36:50.125 --> 36:53.460
about combining resources
for a joint strike mission.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.798
Any chance of hitting
the Cylons where it hurts,

36:59.009 --> 37:00.384
my pleasure.

37:01.970 --> 37:04.805
I'll have Apollo
coordinate with your CAG.

37:12.147 --> 37:15.149
Which leads me to the
next subject, Commander.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.193
I'm going to
integrate the crews.

37:18.278 --> 37:22.156
And I'm starting by reassigning
Captain Adama to the Pegasus air wing.

37:30.332 --> 37:33.250
I have a team
that works very well together.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.506
Let's just cut through it,
shall we?

37:39.591 --> 37:42.051
After reviewing your logs,
it is my judgment

37:42.135 --> 37:46.013
that having your son as Galactica
CAG has been a grave mistake.

37:48.350 --> 37:51.185
He's been insubordinate,
even mutinous.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.229
And these are direct quotes
from your logs, by the way.

37:55.315 --> 37:58.943
And I dare say, he's not the only
one with disciplinary problems.

37:59.027 --> 38:03.697
There's a Kara Thrace who habitually
strikes fellow officers and disobeys orders.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.325
This Lieutenant Agathon
has fraternized with

38:06.409 --> 38:09.536
and evidently impregnated
an enemy agent.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.500
Let's not even
discuss your XO.

38:17.587 --> 38:18.712
So,

38:24.803 --> 38:27.388
there is a complete list
of the transfers.

38:27.764 --> 38:31.892
I thought you said you had no
desire to interfere with my command.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.603
I'm saving your command,
Bill.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.439
You're way too close
to these officers.

38:37.524 --> 38:39.358
And it's blinding you
to their weaknesses

38:39.442 --> 38:43.070
and to the damage that they're
doing to unit cohesion and to morale.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.822
I don't agree.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.373
Well, that is
certainly your right.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.880
You have your orders.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.566
Transfer to Pegasus?

39:21.401 --> 39:22.776
Why the frak
should we do that?

39:22.861 --> 39:24.111
Because those are
your orders.

39:24.154 --> 39:26.155
We can't just let her come
over here That's a load of crap.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.032

39:28.116 --> 39:29.491
on the eve before
a major Cylon operation.

39:29.576 --> 39:31.827
'cause their CAG has a stick
up his ass... That's enough!

39:34.372 --> 39:36.623
You're officers.
Act like it.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.628
She's given you an order.
You will carry it out.

Permission to speak freely?
You may not.

39:47.218 --> 39:51.055

the rules, having our way,

39:51.973 --> 39:54.641

Well, that's over.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.645
You wear the uniform, you will
accept the rules that go with it.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.315
You've been transferred.

and report to the Pegasus CAG.

for all of us.

I could help out.

one Cylon ship in particular

42:07.442 --> 42:10.611
which is larger than anything
we've encountered before.

will be in this star system next.

behind this moon

magnetotail

42:21.039 --> 42:22.915

our dradis signatures.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.320
Get off of her, now!

47:07.575 --> 47:08.825
(SCREAMS)

47:09.076 --> 47:10.285
Motherfrakker!

47:10.828 --> 47:12.871
GAURD: Freeze! Freeze!

47:13.247 --> 47:16.333
Don't either of you
frakking move! Don't move!

47:18.085 --> 47:20.128
Don't either of you
frakking move!

47:20.213 --> 47:21.254
Don't move!

47:21.339 --> 47:22.422
(BOOMER CRYING)

47:22.507 --> 47:24.466
Get down! Get down!

47:24.592 --> 47:26.134
On your knees.

47:26.219 --> 47:29.304
Hands behind your head. Now!

47:30.056 --> 47:31.973
GAURD 2:
Hands behind your head.

47:32.391 --> 47:34.643
Do it now. Do it!

47:36.437 --> 47:37.729
(SOBBING)

47:44.570 --> 47:45.904
GUARD 1: He's dead.

48:15.142 --> 48:18.478
PILOT 1: Pegasus, Raptor 923.
We've cleared Galactica

48:18.563 --> 48:22.023
and are en route with prisoners
and the body of Lieutenant Thorne.

48:22.483 --> 48:24.526
PILOT 2: ETA to Pegasus,
three minutes.

48:26.445 --> 48:28.572
ADAMA:
The assault happened here.

48:28.656 --> 48:31.575
They should face
a court martial on Galactica.

48:31.659 --> 48:35.078
Commander, I am the senior
convening authority present.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.247
And they'll be
tried on Pegasus.

48:37.331 --> 48:40.584
They're my men.
One of my men is dead.

48:40.668 --> 48:44.838
Fine. We both have strong
feelings about the case.

48:44.922 --> 48:47.841
That only underlines the need
for an impartial trial.

48:47.925 --> 48:50.176
Oh, you mean
an independent tribunal?

48:50.261 --> 48:52.679
Because according to
your logs, Commander,

48:52.763 --> 48:55.932
you dissolved an independent tribunal
when you didn't like the verdict.

48:56.017 --> 48:59.936
And if I'm not mistaken, Chief
Tyrol was on trial there as well.

49:00.062 --> 49:01.688
That was a different time.

49:02.106 --> 49:03.857
Yes, indeed it was.

49:04.817 --> 49:07.193
I'll be in touch, Commander.
Thank you.

49:31.344 --> 49:33.553
Remove the restraints,
please.

49:37.767 --> 49:40.477
I'm here under
Admiral Cain's authority.

49:40.895 --> 49:42.062
Do it.

50:09.548 --> 50:12.175
Thank you.
Now, get out.

50:55.511 --> 50:57.137
The food is yours.

50:58.681 --> 51:00.348
It's not a trick.

51:02.476 --> 51:05.478
I'm not gonna take it away
at the last second.

51:07.064 --> 51:08.565
You know, I...

51:10.735 --> 51:13.069
I'm just going to
talk right now.

51:14.488 --> 51:16.990
I don't expect you
to say anything.

51:19.160 --> 51:21.828
Back on Caprica,
before the attack...

51:25.416 --> 51:27.000
And sometimes

51:28.210 --> 51:31.171
I forget there was
a world before the attack.

51:33.340 --> 51:35.800
I knew someone,
a woman,

51:36.802 --> 51:39.429
unlike any other woman
I'd ever known.

51:40.014 --> 51:41.598
She was unique.

51:43.142 --> 51:45.643
Beautiful. Clever.

51:47.855 --> 51:49.272
Intensely sensual.

51:49.356 --> 51:51.524
When she wasn't in my bed,

51:52.693 --> 51:54.611
she was in my thoughts.

51:56.280 --> 51:57.906
She was a Cylon.

51:59.033 --> 52:02.744
And she changed my life in a
very real, very fundamental way,

52:04.538 --> 52:08.208
in that I have quite literally
never stopped thinking about her.

52:10.336 --> 52:12.045
Because I love her.

52:14.089 --> 52:16.299
To this very day,
I love her.

52:19.178 --> 52:21.471
And she looks
exactly like you.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.937
My name is Gaius Baltar.

52:30.856 --> 52:32.899
And I'm here to help you.

53:20.406 --> 53:21.739
(SNIFFLES)

53:45.389 --> 53:47.932
Check me on these
jump coordinates.

53:50.144 --> 53:51.477
Apollo.

53:52.646 --> 53:55.064
Check me on these
jump coordinates.

53:55.482 --> 53:56.649
Sorry.

54:00.112 --> 54:02.155
Jump coordinates verified.

54:02.865 --> 54:04.991
You seem a little distracted,
Captain.

54:05.075 --> 54:06.784
Something I should know about?

54:07.161 --> 54:10.496
Two of my friends just got
arrested and charged with treason.

54:13.626 --> 54:16.794
I suggest you file that
under "not your problem. "

54:17.171 --> 54:20.757
We have a recon mission to perform.
I need your head in the game.

54:22.301 --> 54:23.509
Right.

54:24.595 --> 54:28.556
Pegasus, Blue Team, jump
coordinates set and verified.

54:28.641 --> 54:32.685
Ready to FTL. We will jump in
10 minutes on my mark. Mark.

54:40.235 --> 54:42.278
Any word
on the Chief, sir?

54:42.988 --> 54:45.239
He's gonna have
to stand trial.

54:45.699 --> 54:47.450
He's a good man, sir.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.953
I know. I'll do every... MAN: (ON
WIRELESS) Attention, Galactica.

54:50.037 --> 54:53.081
...Commander Adama,
contact the CIC ASAP.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.500
Adama.

54:55.584 --> 54:58.878
I just talked to Fisk.
Court martial's over.

54:59.004 --> 55:02.215
Over? When did it start?

55:02.299 --> 55:05.802
I don't know, but they've been
found guilty on all counts.

55:05.886 --> 55:09.430
She's going to execute them
both for murder and treason.

55:17.439 --> 55:21.317
I want a Marine strike team
in a Raptor in five minutes.

55:21.902 --> 55:24.237
Prepare to launch
alert fighters.

55:25.114 --> 55:26.781
We have work to do.
Sir.

55:37.126 --> 55:40.086
WOMAN: (ON WIRELESS) Pegasus,
Galactica. Please secure channel.

55:40.421 --> 55:43.506
Commander Adama would like
to speak to Admiral Cain.

55:46.093 --> 55:47.635
DUALLA: Go ahead, sir.

55:48.429 --> 55:50.221
You told me
they'd get a fair trial.

55:50.305 --> 55:52.598
What kind of a trial
could they have possibly had?

55:52.683 --> 55:55.059
CAIN: I assure you,
I heard them out.

55:55.310 --> 55:57.770
I weighed their statements
against those of the guards

55:57.855 --> 56:02.025
and I took into consideration their
service records and commendations.

56:02.109 --> 56:06.029
It was a difficult decision, Commander,
but I dare say, it was a fair one.

56:06.113 --> 56:08.906
They have the right to have
their case heard by a jury.

56:08.991 --> 56:13.244
I am a flag officer on detached
service during a time of war.

56:13.746 --> 56:16.956
Regulations give me broad
authority in this matter.

56:17.541 --> 56:19.333
Launch the fighters.

56:20.586 --> 56:23.713
You can quote me whatever
regulation you'd like.

56:24.298 --> 56:26.424
I'm not gonna let you
execute my men.

56:26.508 --> 56:29.552
I highly suggest you reconsider
that statement, Commander.

56:29.636 --> 56:32.972
Admiral, Galactica is
launching Vipers and a Raptor.

56:34.224 --> 56:38.394
Commander,
why are you launching Vipers?

56:38.771 --> 56:42.565
Please arrange for Chief Tyrol
and Lieutenant Agathon

56:42.649 --> 56:46.110
to be handed over to my
Marines as soon as they arrive.

56:46.487 --> 56:48.362
I don't take orders from you.

56:48.489 --> 56:51.491
Call it whatever you like.
I'm getting my men.

56:51.909 --> 56:54.577
You are making such a mistake.

56:54.703 --> 56:56.954
I'm getting my men.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.425
Action stations.
Action stations.

57:09.510 --> 57:12.637
Admiral, this will
spiral out of control fast.

57:12.763 --> 57:15.181
Launch the alert Vipers.

57:16.225 --> 57:18.559
Adama has taken us
over the line.

57:20.062 --> 57:23.231
He's left me with no choice.
Launch the alert Vipers.

57:29.071 --> 57:31.864
And target the main battery
for Galactica.

57:34.618 --> 57:37.453
And may the Gods
have mercy on their souls.

58:44.271 --> 58:45.313
Here's a good one.

58:45.397 --> 58:46.606
Hut.
Let's make...

58:47.107 --> 58:48.399
(GRUNTING)
Fumble!

58:48.483 --> 58:49.483
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
