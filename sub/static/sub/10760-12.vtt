00:08.500 --> 00:10.200
ROZ: Frasier, I knew
when you bought me lunch,

00:10.400 --> 00:11.800
there was going to be a catch.

00:12.100 --> 00:15.000
- How long is this gonna take?
- Well, it shouldn't take too long, Roz.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.900
I can't believe I'm actually scouring
a science-fiction convention

00:18.300 --> 00:19.300
for <i>X- Men</i> comics.

00:19.500 --> 00:23.600
I feel I'm contributing
to the decline of my son's intellect.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.200
Then why are you doing it?

00:25.500 --> 00:28.300
Well, because I said no
to the eyebrow ring.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.500
Oh, excuse me, good sir.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.500
Could you direct me, please,
to Cubby's World of Comics?

00:33.800 --> 00:35.700
- Yeah, it's right over there.
- Oh.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.300
Thank you. Thank you very much.
You're a fierce but helpful people.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.300
Oh, stop.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.900
- Good Lord. That's Jackson Hedley.
- Who?

00:48.200 --> 00:50.200
FRASIER: Jackson Hedley,
the famous Shakespearean actor.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.000
He came to my school
when I was a teen,

00:52.200 --> 00:54.800
did a show of soliloquies,
began my love affair with the Bard.

00:55.100 --> 00:58.500
Excuse me, Roz, I think I'll just go
pay my respects to Mr. Hedley.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.300
Excuse me. Um, what's
Jackson Hedley doing here?

01:07.600 --> 01:10.600
Signing autographs
and being awesome.

01:12.100 --> 01:16.000
They've got the whole cast
of <i>Space Patrol</i> coming this weekend.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.600
Jackson Hedley
was on a television show?

01:18.900 --> 01:21.800
What, are you kidding?
He's Tobor, the ship's android.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.200
Where you been, man?

01:24.700 --> 01:26.100
I don't know.

01:26.300 --> 01:31.000
Reading, attending the theatre,
getting haircuts.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.200
Hi, Roz.

01:38.900 --> 01:39.900
Hi, Noel.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.000
So you're a closet Trekker.

01:42.300 --> 01:45.700
I always had a feeling
we were more than mere coworkers.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.600
This explains the heat between us.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.400
I feel heat, all right.
Because I'm in hell.

01:53.700 --> 01:56.000
- There you are, Dwayne.
- Thanks, Tobor.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.700
FRASIER:
Hello, Mr. Hedley.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.100
May I say
it's an honour to see you again.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.600
Thank you. So, what would you like
to be autographed today?

02:02.900 --> 02:04.500
Actually, I already have
your autograph.

02:04.700 --> 02:07.600
I got it after seeing
your performance of <i>Hamlet.</i>

02:07.900 --> 02:09.100
Oh, my.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.600
- That was a long time ago.
- But not forgotten.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.900
May I say, on behalf
of my brother and myself,

02:15.200 --> 02:19.300
thank you for opening our young eyes
to the wonders of Shakespeare.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.400
You are more than welcome.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.200
Tell me, do you get to do
much theatre anymore?

02:24.400 --> 02:26.300
Oh, no, I'm afraid
those days are over.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.100
The show became so popular,

02:28.300 --> 02:32.400
I can't get cast as anything
but an android, a cyborg,

02:32.700 --> 02:37.600
or when I get a chance
to really spread my wings, a mutant.

02:37.900 --> 02:42.500
Well, what a shame.
For you and the theatre.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.800
Oh, you are very kind.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.500
Well, my fans await.
It was lovely meeting you, Mr...

02:47.900 --> 02:49.100
Frasier Crane.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.500
Thank you, Mr. Hedley.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.600
It just breaks my heart
to see that man reduced to this.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.700
So demeaning.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.700
Well, so he's not
doing Shakespeare,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
but look, he's got tons of fans
that worship him.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.800
What's so demeaning about that?

03:05.000 --> 03:09.500
Hey, Tobor, would you do
my kid's birthday party?

03:09.800 --> 03:11.700
Here's my card.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.700
Travel time is extra
and I eat by myself.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.500
- Hey, look who I found at the airport.
- Oh.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.800
Welcome home, Dad.
So how was Florida?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.100
Oh, it was a whirlwind.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.900
Duke and I hit the dog track,

03:34.200 --> 03:38.900
and then we met the Michael Jordan
of jai alai players at the Red Lobster.

03:39.300 --> 03:43.000
But the place I went back to most of all
was Captain Pete's Gator Farm.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.600
Ah, ah. Did you go see
the Hemingway home?

03:45.800 --> 03:49.000
Well, you know, Fras,
you can't squeeze everything in.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.800
But I tell you,
these gators are amazing.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.900
You're out in the glades
in this fan boat,

03:55.100 --> 03:59.300
and it's just you and Captain Pete
and a cooler full of raw chickens.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.600
To think I wasted
my last vacation in Vienna.

04:03.900 --> 04:06.700
Then he dangles a chicken at the end
of a stick and before you know it,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.600
a 15-foot monster
comes rushing out of the water.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
And he's yelling:

04:11.200 --> 04:14.300
"Hurry up and take the picture.
This son of a bitch is heavy!"

04:15.600 --> 04:17.200
That's delightful, Dad.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.100
- Where's Daphne?
- My honey bunny has the flu.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.700
Aww, that's too bad.

04:22.900 --> 04:26.100
Probably got it standing
in front of an open refrigerator.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.700
Nice to have you back, Dad.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.200
- Frasier.
- Oh, thank you, Niles.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.800
- You will never guess what I found.
- Hm?

04:37.900 --> 04:41.500
This is the autograph Jackson Hedley
gave me in junior high school.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.800
Oh, Niles.

04:45.200 --> 04:49.800
"Dear Coach Pellit, please excuse
Niles from gym for obvious reasons."

04:50.400 --> 04:52.400
- The other side.
- I figured.

04:53.800 --> 04:58.600
"To Niles, my kingdom
for more fans like you.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.900
Jackson Hedley." Gosh.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.700
That's lovely.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.600
Of course, I'm still envious
that you got to see him again.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.800
You wouldn't be
if you'd been at that convention.

05:08.100 --> 05:12.000
To see the man who defined Hamlet

05:12.200 --> 05:16.400
reduced to hawking T-shirts
and sci-fi gewgaws.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.100
- It's a terrible waste of talent.
- Tragic.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.600
No artist should have to endure that.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.800
If only people could see him
the way we did.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.800
Niles,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.300
how difficult would it be
to mount Jackson's one-man show?

05:32.700 --> 05:33.700
It's relatively simple.

05:33.900 --> 05:37.800
That's true. There's minimal scenery,
no supporting ca...

05:39.900 --> 05:42.300
- Wait a minute, are you suggesting...?
- Well, why not?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.800
There's certainly no shortage
of theatres in this town.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.100
We could do it on a Monday
when they're dark anyway.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.700
We could revive the man's career.

05:48.900 --> 05:52.500
What a gift it would be to return this
man to the stage where he belongs.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.500
It would be like repaying him
for giving us the gift of Shakespeare.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.500
And if the evening goes very well,
who knows?

05:57.800 --> 06:00.200
We could be in for a long run.
We might take it on the road.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.600
Why not a television special?
A much larger audience.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.800
It could become a cottage industry:

06:05.100 --> 06:07.600
T-shirts, posters,
personal appearances.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.900
Thank God we've come along
to save this man.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.300
- Oh, Niles.
- Cheers.

to show Jackson his new venue.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Gosh, what an honour it is

06:21.300 --> 06:23.900
to be reuniting such a great talent
with the stage. Is he here yet?

06:24.200 --> 06:27.100
No, he's cutting the opening ribbon
at Galaxy Mattresses.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.100
Well, once this show opens,

06:29.200 --> 06:33.200
he'll be able to throw away
his oversized novelty shears.

of getting the word out.

please join us on the stage.

Do you really think people
are going to pay money

that I don't miss about performing live?

It's the jitters. It's the dry heaves.

passing out earplugs.

It's not his fault. He's only rusty.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.400
After years on that
ridiculous space opera,

10:12.700 --> 10:13.900
he's picked up some bad habits.

10:14.100 --> 10:17.600
Well, I was fortunate enough to find
a videotape of his one-man show.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.700
Once he sees this, it will remind him
of what good acting is.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.600
Oh, I see my producers
have long faces.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.500
I think I know why.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.700
- You do?
- Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

12:30.200 --> 12:32.000
It is to us.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.500
Well, your worries are at an end.

12:33.700 --> 12:37.500
I've fired the director.
The man's a clod.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.100
I mean, not even the stagehands
follow his directions.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.800
He shouts at them
and they pretend not to hear.

12:45.300 --> 12:50.000
Mr. Hedley, it's not the director.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.100
- We have a problem.
- What sort of problem?

12:53.500 --> 12:54.600
FRASIER:
Let me be frank.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.900
Because an artist of your calibre
deserves honesty.

12:58.200 --> 13:02.900
An acting performance
is a journey of discovery.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.700
This brief rehearsal time
that we've given you

13:08.100 --> 13:13.900
is far too short to reach Parnassus,

13:14.300 --> 13:16.400
home of the muses.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.300
Forgive us for being so blunt.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.500
Oh, I see.
We're getting to the real problem.

13:25.900 --> 13:30.000
I've got untested producers
and they've got the jitters.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.000
But not to worry,
it's perfectly natural.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.000
Do you know
I've never worked with producers

13:35.300 --> 13:37.900
who haven't wanted to pull the plug
before the opening night?

13:40.500 --> 13:43.300
But I won't let you quit.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.300
This show is going on.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.100
In the words of our great author:

13:47.400 --> 13:51.200
Stiffen the sinews,
summon up the blood.

13:51.600 --> 13:57.000
Disguise fair nature
with hard-favour'd rage,

13:59.100 --> 14:04.200
then lend the eye a terrible aspect.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.500
I think he's getting better, don't you?

[AUDIENCE CHATTERING]

14:16.000 --> 14:18.700
MAN:
Fifteen minutes to curtain.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.900
Look out there.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.300
Everybody we know is out there.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.500
Look at all those smiling faces,

14:26.800 --> 14:31.600
soon to be frozen
in a rictus of revenge.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.300
- The place is packed.
- It's standing room only.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.700
You know, Niles,

14:41.300 --> 14:46.000
I think we may have exceeded
maximum occupancy.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.800
That could be a fire hazard.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.800
It would be a shame if someone
should call the fire marshal

14:54.200 --> 14:56.200
and he should shut us down.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.500
Yes, it would.

14:57.800 --> 15:01.500
A damn shame if the old phone
in the marshal's office

15:01.900 --> 15:03.200
would start to jingle, jing...

15:03.400 --> 15:04.900
Just call!

15:06.500 --> 15:08.600
- Ten minutes to curtain.
- No, I'm sorry.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.300
I believe that your watch
happens to be a tad fast.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.300
It's electromagnetically set
to Greenwich Mean Time.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.700
Get me a Sprite.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.700
Well?

15:19.800 --> 15:21.600
The marshal will be here
as quickly as he can.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.300
Five-alarmer in the paper district.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.600
Just our luck.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.100
What are we going to do now?

15:28.300 --> 15:29.300
Hey, guys.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.100
- Roz.
- This is Jackson Hedley's father.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.300
I found him wandering around
looking for Jackson.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.100
- Lovely to see you.
- Thank God I'm not late.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.900
You know,
I'm Jackson's lucky charm.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.500
Do you know he's so superstitious,

15:40.800 --> 15:43.400
one day I didn't turn up
for opening night

15:43.600 --> 15:45.900
and he refused to go on.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.700
Is that so?

15:51.300 --> 15:54.400
We must get you to him immediately.
You see, you're at the wrong theatre.

15:54.700 --> 15:57.000
Yes, yes, Jackson's performing
clear across town.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.500
But the sign outside says
"An Evening with Jackson Hedley."

16:00.800 --> 16:03.500
Yes, I know.
You see, there's been a terrible snafu.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.400
- Snafu.
- With the marquee letters.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.200
You see, they got ours,
we got theirs.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.300
- What's playing here?
- <i>Cats</i>.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.400
Ah. I love <i>Cats</i>.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.900
Who doesn't?
But surely you love your son more.

16:17.100 --> 16:22.500
Yes. Luckily this young lady
knows this town inside out.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.500
Roz, please escort Mr. Hedley
to the Portland Playhouse ASAP.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.500
- But...
- There's no time for buts. Do it now.

16:27.700 --> 16:30.300
- All right, let's go, Mr. Hedley.
- Oh, please, call me Cecil.

16:30.700 --> 16:31.800
All right, Cecil.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.700

a predilection for brunettes.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.800
Mr. Hedley,
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.200
It's about your father.
It seems his plane is going to be late.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.200
You mean my father
won't make it for the show?

16:53.400 --> 16:55.100
We know this must be
devastating to you.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.500
On the contrary.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.800
For once my performance
won't be inhibited

17:00.000 --> 17:02.500
by that judgemental nitpicker.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.900
Tonight I can really cut loose.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.900
Those seats in the very back row
will be rattling.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.500
That is good news.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.700
Five minutes to curtain.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.599
And now, if you'll excuse me,

17:19.900 --> 17:23.400
it's time to centre.

17:30.100 --> 17:32.500
Any more ideas?

17:32.800 --> 17:36.300
These are the producers.
The fire marshal's here.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.400
Do you guys have any idea
how many people you got out there?

17:39.700 --> 17:41.000
You're way over capacity.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.200
You're not going to shut us down,
are you?

17:43.500 --> 17:47.100
Frasier, I knew we shouldn't have
added all those dry wooden seats.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.900
Well, maybe next time
you'll know better.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.800
Has anyone seen my other skull?

Hey, you're Tobor.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.100
Correct.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.800
I used to watch your show
all the time.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.800
I even have that old <i>Playboy</i> when
Space Princess Alexa did that spread.

Yes, I've got that one too.

he was the one performing tonight.

on one condition:

I get to watch the show.

- We're out of seats.
- It's okay. I'll sit in the aisle.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.800
- Three minutes to curtain.
- Ah, here's the right one.

just take our lumps.

going to take any lumps.
