00:13.802 --> 00:15.485
We should get back
to the convoy.

00:15.541 --> 00:18.643
Running low on gas.
There were three cans of gas.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.180
We can help you.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.590
That's what they said.

00:25.668 --> 00:28.044
The oil fields?
We lost them.

00:28.120 --> 00:33.783
I never considered "documentary
to spread the word" angle.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.693
Morgan,
I think it's happening.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.561
I don't think there's
much time left.

00:38.897 --> 00:40.297
This is the future, Morgan.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.308
You just don't see it yet,
but you will.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.334
You should join us.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.575
Like I said, I got lucky.

00:51.577 --> 00:53.427
And then I got unlucky.

00:53.429 --> 00:56.171
Our water supply
started to go bad.

00:56.173 --> 00:57.581
We couldn't grow food.

00:57.583 --> 00:59.825
We were starving.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.585
We'd lost so much.

01:01.587 --> 01:03.162
We needed help.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.663
But out here,

01:04.665 --> 01:06.682
help isn't
an easy thing to find.

01:06.684 --> 01:09.852
We were ready to split
before...

01:09.854 --> 01:11.279
they showed up.

01:11.281 --> 01:13.614
That's when
everything changed.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.674
They said they were trying
to build something bigger,

01:15.676 --> 01:16.933
something better.

01:16.935 --> 01:18.935
That it wasn't about today.

01:18.937 --> 01:20.937
That it was about tomorrow.

01:20.939 --> 01:22.865
I'm alive because of them.

01:22.867 --> 01:24.041
Because of her.

01:24.043 --> 01:25.868
Because of Virginia.

01:25.870 --> 01:28.129
Most folks call me Ginny.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.298
But this ain't about me.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.466
Or any other single person.

01:32.468 --> 01:37.363
This is about how we can get
from today to tomorrow.

01:37.365 --> 01:40.032
Now, we've been
traveling all around,

01:40.034 --> 01:42.459
and every story is the same.

01:42.461 --> 01:44.370
Settlement after settlement...

01:44.372 --> 01:46.221
It's a condo complex.

01:46.223 --> 01:47.381
A bowling alley.

01:47.383 --> 01:48.465
A logging camp.

01:48.467 --> 01:49.758
A rec and a rink.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.134
A country club.

01:51.136 --> 01:52.469
These are places filled

01:52.471 --> 01:55.397
with good people,
good ideas.

01:55.399 --> 01:57.140
They just need
a little help.

01:57.142 --> 01:58.826
They fixed everything
they said they would.

01:58.828 --> 02:02.330
We fixed their water supply,
helped them grow more food.

02:02.332 --> 02:03.873
They made the place

02:03.875 --> 02:05.724
into somewhere people
would want to live again.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.243
Before,
we were barely surviving.

02:08.245 --> 02:11.564
Now we are thriving.

02:11.566 --> 02:14.842
The future isn't some
far-flung flight of fancy.

02:14.844 --> 02:17.327
We are building it every day.

02:17.329 --> 02:19.905
Each one of us holds the key.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.183
That's why we wear these.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.910
Now, this isn't about
how we can help you.

02:24.912 --> 02:28.430
This is about
how we can all help each other.

02:28.432 --> 02:31.100
How we can fix the things
that are broken.

02:31.102 --> 02:36.030
Now, I know
it's hard to believe.

02:36.032 --> 02:37.923
This world
gives us every reason

02:37.925 --> 02:40.442
to doubt
people can help each other.

02:40.444 --> 02:44.246
But believe me... we can.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.564
So if you see somebody

02:45.566 --> 02:48.601
wearing one of these
or one of these,

02:48.603 --> 02:50.378
we're here to help.

02:50.380 --> 02:52.380
Pick up the walkie.

02:52.382 --> 02:54.607
Channel five.

02:54.609 --> 02:58.719
<i>Each one of us
holds a key to the future.</i>

02:58.721 --> 03:01.055
<i>The more we help each other,</i>

03:01.057 --> 03:03.039
<i>the sooner we'll get there.</i>

03:04.635 --> 03:06.560
That's not the truth.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.637
I know.

03:30.387 --> 03:32.561

03:41.321 --> 03:44.490
We've been driving
for five days now,

03:44.492 --> 03:47.493
stopping every 40 miles or so
to scout.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.845
I'm not gonna lie.

03:49.847 --> 03:51.513
It's tough.

03:51.515 --> 03:54.183
That's why we're making
another one of these.

03:54.185 --> 03:56.001
To show you everything.

03:56.003 --> 04:01.449
Doing things
the way we do...

04:01.451 --> 04:02.933
it isn't easy.

04:02.935 --> 04:06.345
It's hard.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.789
'Cause they're not
supposed to be easy.

04:08.791 --> 04:11.850
But it's important.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.461
'Cause the way
we're doing things...

04:13.463 --> 04:15.463
...is the right way.

04:15.465 --> 04:18.357
We've only got
one tanker of gas,

04:18.358 --> 04:21.527
but it is going to get us
to a place we can call home.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.879
I know
we're going to find it.

04:23.881 --> 04:27.032
Luci stayed back at Tank Town
so we could have a shot at it.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.976
We find it, then we're
going to get her back.

04:28.978 --> 04:30.460
Yeah, Virginia might say

04:30.462 --> 04:32.146
what we're doing
is impossible...

04:32.148 --> 04:33.555
...but if you're watching this,

04:33.557 --> 04:35.298
you're going to see

04:35.300 --> 04:38.877
the impossible is possible.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.428
And we don't have to lie.

04:40.430 --> 04:42.047
We don't have
to leave things out.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.140
We don't have to change things
to hide the truth.

04:44.142 --> 04:46.494
We don't have
to twist people's words.

04:46.496 --> 04:49.813
We don't have to make
a fake documentary like she did.

04:49.815 --> 04:53.000
I told her
we were gonna prove her wrong.

04:53.002 --> 04:55.410
This is what happened.

04:55.412 --> 04:57.320
This is how we did it.

04:57.322 --> 04:59.423
This is the truth.

05:00.584 --> 05:02.084
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:02.086 --> 05:03.761
Got this.

05:09.001 --> 05:10.518
Here.

05:13.748 --> 05:16.265
- That better?
- Yeah.

05:16.267 --> 05:18.025
Thank you.

05:21.272 --> 05:24.439
Think you'll need anything else
while I'm out there?

05:24.441 --> 05:26.775
Candy beansies...

05:26.777 --> 05:28.093
if you see them.

05:30.689 --> 05:32.540
If I do.

05:37.213 --> 05:38.712
She's dehydrated.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.714
She's having trouble
keeping food down.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.533
And you think
it's the radiation?

05:43.535 --> 05:45.627
Could be.

05:45.629 --> 05:48.447
Could be something else.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.057
Before, we would have just
made a referral

05:50.059 --> 05:53.710
to the oncology department,
but...

05:54.455 --> 05:57.639
...guess I'm gonna have to find
some medical journals.

05:57.641 --> 06:01.126
I wasn't there
when she needed me.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.461
I wasn't there
when the rest of the group

06:02.463 --> 06:05.889
needed me at Tank Town.

06:05.891 --> 06:08.742
But I am here now.

06:08.744 --> 06:11.637
You walkied Grace
when we were away.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.972
Said you needed
to tell her something.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.325
Did you?

06:16.327 --> 06:18.644
No.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.045
What was it?

06:22.833 --> 06:24.592
Doesn't matter.

06:26.095 --> 06:32.749
I think I have an idea,
but I'm not sure.

06:32.751 --> 06:34.843
Did he tell you
what he wanted to say?

06:34.845 --> 06:39.014
You know, being away
from everybody, it was...

06:39.016 --> 06:42.501
it was hard.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.261
But some good
came out of it.

06:46.765 --> 06:48.515
I thought you and Morgan
were gonna kill me

06:48.517 --> 06:50.934
when you found me.

06:50.936 --> 06:54.104
Virginia...

06:54.106 --> 06:56.790
the way she does things...

06:56.792 --> 07:00.853
it makes you scared
to trust people.

07:00.855 --> 07:03.522
But here I am.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.706
Guess, in a way, I'm lucky.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.175
Tom?

07:09.713 --> 07:11.096
Janis?

07:11.807 --> 07:14.366
Janis!

07:14.368 --> 07:15.643
- Oh, my God!
- Tom!

07:15.645 --> 07:17.811
Janis!

07:22.209 --> 07:23.967
Oh, my God!

07:23.969 --> 07:26.654
Oh! Oh!

07:26.656 --> 07:28.304
They found my sister.

07:32.310 --> 07:35.888
They found my brother.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.457
They found you.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.503
I wanted to help
with the documentary.

07:42.505 --> 07:46.064
What they're doing here,
it is working.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.158
And they leave room
for everyone,

07:48.160 --> 07:50.678
not just the people
Virginia deems useful.

07:53.832 --> 07:57.167
Everybody is useful.

07:57.169 --> 07:58.727
People need to see that.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.765
When we find our new home,

08:03.767 --> 08:05.359
what are you
going to do?

08:05.361 --> 08:11.256
I kinda hope I get the chance
to keep doing this.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.774
What does painting
do for you?

08:12.776 --> 08:14.225
I don't know.

08:14.227 --> 08:17.020
When we first started,
I hoped finding...

08:17.022 --> 08:19.373
the artist would help me.

08:19.375 --> 08:23.452
You know,
it was what... I...

08:23.454 --> 08:26.880
It was how I wanted to be,
if that makes sense.

08:26.882 --> 08:29.007
If art makes sense.
I mean...

08:31.111 --> 08:32.885
But it's...
it's kinda the only thing

08:32.888 --> 08:35.038
that makes sense to me.

08:35.039 --> 08:40.969
<i>Strip mall off 15's toast.</i>

08:40.971 --> 08:43.304
Daniel,
how's that school looking?

08:43.307 --> 08:45.882
<i>It's gone.
Burned down.</i>

08:45.884 --> 08:48.235
<i>There's nothing left.</i>

09:02.142 --> 09:05.252
I'm not thinking about
anything except making sure we land.

09:05.254 --> 09:08.663
I'm the one who picked
the direction we're heading.

09:08.665 --> 09:13.318
It felt right.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.911
I'm sticking with that.

09:14.913 --> 09:17.080
I think she's right.

09:17.082 --> 09:18.432
She's got
what a lot of people

09:18.434 --> 09:22.177
spend their whole lives
looking for.

09:22.179 --> 09:23.512
Faith.

09:23.514 --> 09:27.516
I saw the first movie
they made.

09:27.518 --> 09:29.610
I thought it was bullshit.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.336
Now I'm a part
of said bullshit,

09:31.338 --> 09:32.446
which, it turns out,

09:32.448 --> 09:34.764
isn't actually bullshit
after all.

09:34.766 --> 09:36.091
You going to paint again?

09:36.093 --> 09:37.951
Once we get
where we're going?

09:48.856 --> 09:50.923
We'll see.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.479
Hey.

10:05.481 --> 10:06.814
It's okay.

10:06.816 --> 10:09.132
You'll get it.

10:09.134 --> 10:13.303
Put your pointer here.

10:13.305 --> 10:16.715
Then the middle there.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.067
And that there.
Yeah.

10:19.069 --> 10:20.569
- Got it?
- Yeah.

10:20.571 --> 10:23.905
Now strum
the bottom four strings.

10:25.742 --> 10:28.560
Hey.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.505
Getting there.
One more time.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.583
Hey, you got it.

10:34.585 --> 10:39.254
I just want to be around
long enough to see it.

10:39.256 --> 10:42.391
The looks on everyone's faces
when we get there.

10:44.669 --> 10:50.566
To know that
everyone's gonna be okay.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.177
We're under 500 G's.

10:54.179 --> 10:55.937
That's enough
for one more push.

10:55.939 --> 10:58.514
It'll give us, what...
50 miles?

10:58.516 --> 11:00.683
If we leave two or three cars
behind.

11:00.685 --> 11:02.110
And everything
that's in them.

11:02.112 --> 11:04.262
Perhaps we should consider
a different direction.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.539
Well, we can't
change course now.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.933
There's nothing out there.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.953
Hey, I suggest
you turning that off.

11:11.955 --> 11:14.272
This may not be an aspect
you want to document.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.791
This is about showing things
as they really are.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.870
We got a breach.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.058
- I'll check the kits.
- Thank you.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.685
Somebody?

11:31.308 --> 11:33.049
Dwight? You good?

11:33.051 --> 11:35.068
Hey, you guys
need to come look at this.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.737
I think every now and then,

11:36.739 --> 11:39.406
the universe has a way
of speaking to you.

11:39.408 --> 11:42.326
- What is it?
- Look at that.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.232
It's from a Gulch.

11:49.234 --> 11:51.143
Very first one ever built.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.602
What,
you've been there?

11:52.604 --> 11:53.812
Yeah. I mean, before.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.071
We must be closer
than I thought.

11:55.073 --> 11:56.823
And why would
a Wild West attraction

11:56.825 --> 11:58.166
be a suitable home
for us?

11:58.168 --> 12:00.485
Well, these places
were designed to operate

12:00.487 --> 12:01.911
like everything did before...

12:01.913 --> 12:03.746
no gasoline,
no electricity.

12:03.748 --> 12:05.173
There's plenty of room
for all of us.

12:05.175 --> 12:06.549
There's a fishing hole
nearby.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.167
And I believe
this particular Gulch

12:08.169 --> 12:09.419
had a cattle fence
around the perimeter.

12:09.421 --> 12:10.604
They kept bison.

12:10.606 --> 12:11.997
But you haven't been there
in years.

12:11.999 --> 12:12.940
We don't even know
what it's like.

12:14.652 --> 12:17.686
We've exhausted
most everything in this area.

12:17.688 --> 12:20.656
If John is right,
this could work.

12:25.770 --> 12:30.365
One of those places
saved my life before.

12:30.367 --> 12:32.442
I guess lightning
can strike twice.

12:32.444 --> 12:33.627
Yeah.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.630
It feels like
the right place.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.448
This is what
we've been looking for.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.712
I think we found it.

12:43.714 --> 12:45.955
Does it have a barbershop?

12:45.957 --> 12:49.142
We're about 50 miles east.

12:49.144 --> 12:52.220
It'll be a stretch,
but I've driven further on less.

12:52.222 --> 12:55.874
Hard as it is...

12:55.876 --> 12:57.567
it's worth it.

12:59.563 --> 13:01.880
June?!

13:01.882 --> 13:04.640
June!

13:04.642 --> 13:07.577
Charlie, what's wrong?!

13:09.072 --> 13:10.521
You okay?
Can you hear me?

13:10.523 --> 13:11.748
She's...

13:22.152 --> 13:23.969
Grace, can you hear me?

13:25.239 --> 13:27.139
Come on, Grace.

13:28.166 --> 13:30.183
Grace...

13:30.185 --> 13:33.762
Grace, can you hear me?

13:33.764 --> 13:35.263
She's severely dehydrated.

13:35.265 --> 13:38.416
She's tachycardic.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.176
Her blood pressure's low.

13:40.178 --> 13:41.862
We need to get her
some more fluids or...

13:41.864 --> 13:44.680
Or... Or what, June?

13:44.682 --> 13:46.424
We just...

13:46.426 --> 13:48.368
- What?
- We need to get moving.

13:50.688 --> 13:53.707
Grace.
Come on, Grace.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.559
Can you see anything?

14:12.561 --> 14:14.953
I don't know.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.639
I thought we should take
everything we could

14:17.641 --> 14:19.048
out of that mall.

14:19.050 --> 14:21.551
Even if she did not
want to know then.

14:21.553 --> 14:22.927
Well, I thought
it might help me treat her

14:22.929 --> 14:26.481
if I knew
what was going on.

14:26.483 --> 14:29.801
But to be honest...

14:29.803 --> 14:31.536
I don't even know
what to look for.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.415
She will be awake, though...
right?...

14:35.417 --> 14:37.309
by the time
we get to the Gulch?

14:37.311 --> 14:40.495
It depends on
what's actually going on.

14:40.497 --> 14:43.832
I could treat the symptoms,
but until I really know...

14:43.834 --> 14:47.319
- That's all I can do.
- Yeah.

14:48.413 --> 14:53.975
And how long, you know,
can she go without fluids?

14:56.605 --> 14:58.396
Not long, Morgan.

15:00.258 --> 15:02.834
Tess?

15:02.836 --> 15:05.612
Tess, that retirement home,
how far was it?

15:05.614 --> 15:08.189
<i>I don't know.
15 miles?</i>

15:08.191 --> 15:09.841
<i>Roof was caved in,</i>

15:09.843 --> 15:11.660
<i>but there might still be
some supplies left.</i>

15:13.347 --> 15:15.013
I'm gonna go.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.848
I'll circle back
to the convoy

15:16.850 --> 15:18.441
when I get
what she needs.

15:18.443 --> 15:20.018
<i>May not need to, Mo-mo.</i>

15:20.020 --> 15:21.519
<i>The a detour
will take us</i>

15:21.521 --> 15:22.945
<i>a little further north
than we wanted,</i>

15:22.947 --> 15:24.631
<i>but I think
there's a shortcut</i>

15:24.633 --> 15:27.375
<i>where we can make up
some miles on the B side.</i>

15:27.377 --> 15:29.970
You sure about this,
Morgan?

15:34.050 --> 15:36.626
She'll want to be awake
when we get there, you know?

15:38.814 --> 15:41.148
She'll want to see it.

15:41.150 --> 15:42.774
She will.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.627
This is the part you won't see
on Virginia's tape.

15:54.629 --> 15:56.496
Because this is something
she'd never do.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.723
Well, if this place
was in better shape,

15:58.725 --> 16:00.500
I'd say we could rest here
for a bit.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.377
But nope.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.402
June, Alicia,

16:10.404 --> 16:12.253
we're coming up
empty-handed here.

16:12.255 --> 16:13.996
Any luck on your end?

16:13.998 --> 16:15.757
<i>Nothing.</i>

16:15.759 --> 16:17.091
<i>Not yet.</i>

16:17.093 --> 16:18.351
God.

16:19.504 --> 16:20.729
Hey.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.690
Never shoulda left her.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.100
Hey, come on, now.

16:26.102 --> 16:27.769
It's gonna be all right.

16:27.771 --> 16:29.604
We just gotta keep lookin'.

16:29.606 --> 16:32.424
So, Morgan and Grace,

16:32.426 --> 16:34.092
is there something
going on there?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.869
I'm not sure.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.353
Maybe?

16:37.355 --> 16:39.497
Well, that's
a bittersweet thing.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.027
You okay?

16:45.029 --> 16:47.547
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.625
I just...

16:50.627 --> 16:52.961
I don't want to wait
anymore.

16:52.963 --> 16:54.279
I think when we get
to the Gulch,

16:54.281 --> 16:56.965
we get married.

16:56.967 --> 16:59.392
Right away.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.566
I think
that's a great idea.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.069
Okay.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.795
Okay.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.146
I love you.

17:12.147 --> 17:14.115
Keep it under your hat.

17:20.656 --> 17:22.915
<i>Hey, Al, how's it
looking downstairs?</i>

17:22.917 --> 17:25.492
<i>We didn't find anything.</i>

17:25.494 --> 17:27.403
Morgan, June?

17:27.405 --> 17:28.588
We got it.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.648
Six.
They look viable.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.074
<i>We're looking
in the east wing.</i>

17:32.076 --> 17:33.927
<i>There's nothing here.</i>

17:46.758 --> 17:48.775
Hey, thanks.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.949
It's good, right?

17:59.454 --> 18:01.246
Great.

18:02.866 --> 18:04.291
I don't know.

18:04.293 --> 18:06.084
At one point,
it was the only thing I had.

18:10.206 --> 18:13.041
Like, it was...

18:13.043 --> 18:14.801
taking over.

18:18.122 --> 18:21.266
But now it's not
the only thing I have.

18:27.557 --> 18:29.724
How do you feel?

18:29.726 --> 18:32.152
Better.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.154
Thank you.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.226
Uh...

18:48.228 --> 18:50.545
What is it, Morgan?

18:53.842 --> 18:56.659
I'm, uh...

18:56.661 --> 18:59.346
I'm just glad
you're feeling better.

19:04.427 --> 19:06.836
This shortcut
is gonna get us back on track.

19:06.838 --> 19:08.079
Ha ha!

19:08.081 --> 19:10.656
Ginny, you can suck it.

19:10.658 --> 19:12.767
She would've never made
that detour.

19:12.769 --> 19:14.435
Not for one person.

19:14.437 --> 19:16.863
Not for someone who's sick.

19:16.865 --> 19:20.033
These people,
what they're building...

19:20.035 --> 19:22.535
that's the future.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.763
Or at least the one
I want to be a part of.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.932
We got Grace
what she needed.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.542
We didn't lose any ground
doing it.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.211
Yeah, it's a risk.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.028
But so was lighting a runway
with Christmas lights,

19:33.030 --> 19:34.122
and look how that turned out.

19:34.124 --> 19:36.791
There was a time
when I was shot,

19:36.793 --> 19:38.200
I was good as dead,

19:38.202 --> 19:40.019
and they didn't
give up on me.

19:40.021 --> 19:43.114
They risked their lives
to help me do the right thing.

19:43.116 --> 19:44.857
To help me find my sister.

19:44.859 --> 19:46.467
To help me find my faith.

19:46.469 --> 19:48.119
They forgave me.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.562
They took me
out of the warehouse.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.689
- Back to her.
- Back to people.

19:56.312 --> 19:58.463
What's going on?

19:58.465 --> 20:01.074
Tell me
what's taking so long.

20:01.076 --> 20:05.412
<i>Looks like this bridge
is maxed out.</i>

20:05.414 --> 20:08.206
I'll be back.

20:18.168 --> 20:21.410
Well, we got the MRAP
and a few of the cars across.

20:21.412 --> 20:23.437
That semi's gonna be
too heavy.

20:23.439 --> 20:24.989
These old planks
are not gonna hold.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.566
We backed it off
just in time.

20:26.568 --> 20:27.767
I'm not even sure

20:27.769 --> 20:29.827
we should be standing here
right now.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.163
So can we leave the tanker
behind?

20:32.165 --> 20:34.089
If we do that,
we'll never get to the Gulch.

20:34.091 --> 20:36.425
There aren't any other crossings
for miles.

20:36.427 --> 20:38.503
We don't have enough gas
to try another route.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.022
Then we gotta figure out a way
to patch the hole.

20:41.024 --> 20:43.432
I like the tune you're
strumming, compadre.

20:43.434 --> 20:45.309
I saw some wooden planks
over there.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.602
They might fit.

20:46.604 --> 20:47.920
Take who you need.

20:47.922 --> 20:49.138
See if you can
make that work.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.791
We've got too much weight
here!

20:51.793 --> 20:53.509
Everybody
get off the bridge!

20:53.511 --> 20:55.303
Ease off the bridge!

20:55.305 --> 20:56.463
Back up the tanker!

20:56.465 --> 20:57.947
Don't back the tanker off.

20:57.949 --> 20:59.207
The bridge
won't take the stress.

20:59.209 --> 21:00.541
Hey!
Hey! A bucket brigade!

21:00.543 --> 21:01.968
We can get the gas
to the other side

21:01.970 --> 21:03.044
to fill off the cars!

21:03.046 --> 21:04.937
- Yeah.
- Let's do that!

21:04.939 --> 21:07.548
What can I do?

21:07.550 --> 21:09.050
Let's get everybody
out of the cars

21:09.052 --> 21:10.218
and over the bridge.

21:10.220 --> 21:11.961
We're gonna space you out...

21:11.963 --> 21:14.964
one person every 20 feet!

21:14.966 --> 21:16.708
Hey, Morgan, Morgan,
we got company!

21:17.894 --> 21:20.487
Everybody wait!

21:20.489 --> 21:23.114
June,
get on with the gas.

21:24.551 --> 21:25.825
Howdy there.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.702
Looks like you folks
could use a hand.

21:36.811 --> 21:39.005
Got trouble with the tanker,
Morgan?

21:39.007 --> 21:41.966
It is nothing
we can't handle.

21:46.422 --> 21:49.331
See you're making good use
of our gas.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.759
Well, it sure beats
saddle sores, don't it?

21:51.761 --> 21:53.335
Yeah.

21:53.337 --> 21:55.170
It's a different kinda
horsepower.

21:55.172 --> 21:56.989
There a problem?

21:56.991 --> 21:58.525
No, we got this.

21:58.527 --> 22:00.084
You help the others.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.753
We're gonna need the bridge
in working order.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.588
All right, I think I'm
better served right here.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.939
No, he's right.

22:04.941 --> 22:06.758
You can put those down.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.092
Boys.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.869
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

22:09.871 --> 22:12.354
You know
what we're capable of.

22:12.356 --> 22:14.374
You're good.

22:19.363 --> 22:23.291
Oh, hey, Tom.

22:23.293 --> 22:25.200
What are you doing
with that?

22:25.202 --> 22:26.553
He's helping me
get the story.

22:26.555 --> 22:28.871
- Like I told you.
- And which story is that?

22:28.873 --> 22:30.873
The one where you get
your ass handed to you.

22:30.875 --> 22:32.133
By us.

22:32.135 --> 22:34.710
Still fooling yourself,
huh, Al.

22:34.712 --> 22:36.287
We're not
fooling anybody.

22:36.289 --> 22:38.790
People are gonna know
the truth.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.124
This is how.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.051
Well, there's the truth, Al,

22:42.053 --> 22:44.145
and then there's <i>the</i> truth.

22:44.147 --> 22:45.313
I hope you pick the one

22:45.315 --> 22:46.739
that keeps
the most people alive.

22:46.741 --> 22:49.058
How did you know
where we were?

22:49.060 --> 22:50.818
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

22:50.820 --> 22:53.154
We've been keeping an eye
on the convoy.

22:53.156 --> 22:55.915
We could learn a thing or two
from you.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.751
Stripping the cars,
lightening the load.

22:58.753 --> 23:01.236
You folks stretched
that homemade petrol

23:01.238 --> 23:03.423
farther than
we ever thought possible.

23:03.425 --> 23:06.334
But then, Morgan,

23:06.336 --> 23:08.502
you went out of your way

23:08.504 --> 23:11.080
to get medicine
for a woman who's dying.

23:11.082 --> 23:12.506
And that's why you're here.

23:12.508 --> 23:13.933
And why are you?

23:13.935 --> 23:15.343
- To help you cross this bridge.
- Ha!

23:15.345 --> 23:17.753
In both the literal
and proverbial sense.

23:17.755 --> 23:20.164
You all are gonna end up
just like her.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.333
Unless you ask for help.

23:22.335 --> 23:24.685
We can fix this for you.

23:24.687 --> 23:28.263
What exactly would taking
your help mean for us?

23:28.265 --> 23:30.174
Victor, right?

23:30.176 --> 23:33.936
I was wondering when
we'd finally cross corridors.

23:33.938 --> 23:35.863
Taking
what we're offering...

23:35.865 --> 23:38.791
it means something different
for everybody.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.368
Like what?

23:40.370 --> 23:43.037
Victor?

23:43.039 --> 23:44.297
I'm just asking her

23:44.299 --> 23:46.040
to lay all her cards
out on the table.

23:46.042 --> 23:48.042
Leaf through the catalogue,
as it were.

23:48.044 --> 23:50.637
Well, Victor,
it's hard to say.

23:50.639 --> 23:52.138
We'd sort it out,

23:52.140 --> 23:54.031
depending on what each of you
could provide us.

23:54.033 --> 23:57.885
We are in the midst of
a rather exciting expansion.

23:57.887 --> 24:01.706
We need good people,
and there aren't many left.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.557
There aren't many people left,
full stop.

24:03.559 --> 24:05.467
That why you tried
to kill me?

24:05.469 --> 24:07.136
No, Tom,
I tried to kill you

24:07.138 --> 24:09.638
'cause your track record
made you a liability.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.991
I'm not gonna apologize
for my methods.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.567
Not when they get results.

24:13.569 --> 24:16.145
We already said no.

24:16.147 --> 24:18.556
You know, Dwight, I checked up
on your wife like I said.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.333
Easy!

24:20.335 --> 24:22.076
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey.

24:22.078 --> 24:23.503
Dwight, Dwight.

24:27.324 --> 24:29.066
Yeah.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.401
It's all right.

24:30.403 --> 24:32.737
We've got an engineer
over at the Lanes

24:32.739 --> 24:35.239
who said he actually
broke bread with her

24:35.241 --> 24:37.684
a few months back.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.985
Said Sherry seemed
real worried about you.

24:39.987 --> 24:41.537
Okay, stop.

24:41.539 --> 24:43.247
You didn't say her name
in the documentary.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.357
How else could I know?

24:44.359 --> 24:46.417
Stop.

24:46.419 --> 24:49.770
This group... us...

24:49.772 --> 24:51.756
whatever
you want to call us,

24:51.758 --> 24:53.749
we're here because
we want to do things

24:53.751 --> 24:56.944
differently from you.

24:56.946 --> 24:59.113
And we're gonna keep
doing things that way.

24:59.115 --> 25:00.948
That way
keeps people alive.

25:00.950 --> 25:02.600
Well,
it won't for much longer!

25:02.602 --> 25:05.527
The future isn't over there,
Morgan.

25:05.529 --> 25:07.121
It's with us.

25:07.123 --> 25:09.865
We both want
the same thing.

25:09.867 --> 25:12.868
We just have a different way
of getting there.

25:12.870 --> 25:16.689
Now, if anybody wants to come
try the way that works,

25:16.691 --> 25:19.283
they're welcome.

25:19.285 --> 25:23.621
She's right.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.898
Anyone who would rather
be with her,

25:25.900 --> 25:28.292
feel free.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.794
Get your things.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.028
Go now.

25:37.220 --> 25:40.488
I think our choice
is pretty clear.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.067
Guys got a good hold on them,
don't ya?

25:47.255 --> 25:49.889
Virginia?

25:49.891 --> 25:51.457
Your stratagem...

25:51.459 --> 25:53.501
following us around
as you were...

25:53.503 --> 25:55.820
it doesn't seem
particularly efficient.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.263
You know what, Victor?

25:57.265 --> 26:00.433
It's not.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.268
Boys.

26:07.074 --> 26:09.275
Yeah, that oughta
get the job done.

26:09.277 --> 26:12.670
A little
"call the kids to dinner."

26:12.672 --> 26:15.764
We saw a herd
just down the road.

26:15.766 --> 26:18.342
You folks might just be
the soup du jour.

26:18.344 --> 26:22.079
When you need help,
give us a holler.

26:37.288 --> 26:39.880
Let's get everybody
ready to cross the bridge!

26:39.882 --> 26:41.699
- Get 'em outta the cars now!
- Let's go!

26:41.701 --> 26:43.309
All right,
everyone grab your stuff!

26:43.311 --> 26:45.444
- Let's go!
- We got walkers!

26:45.446 --> 26:46.554
Get your weapons,

26:46.556 --> 26:47.947
get any water
to the other side!

26:47.949 --> 26:49.165
How we doing
with that patch?!

26:49.167 --> 26:51.559
If I'm being honest,
it needs work!

26:51.561 --> 26:52.968
You keep going!

26:52.970 --> 26:55.880
We'll buy you
as much time as we can.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.882
We need to block
this bridge.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.558
Get what you can.
Bail if you need to.

26:59.560 --> 27:00.718
Okay.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.828
June?

27:01.830 --> 27:03.554
I'll stay on the gas.

27:03.556 --> 27:05.981
Let's go!
Everybody over the bridge!

27:07.602 --> 27:09.818
Go, go, go!

27:09.820 --> 27:11.062
Come on, guys!

27:11.064 --> 27:12.171
Come on! Keep moving!

27:34.470 --> 27:37.029
Come on!
Go! Hurry!

27:40.776 --> 27:42.776
Strand, behind you!

27:55.108 --> 27:56.507
Morgan, to your left!

27:58.628 --> 27:59.844
Hyah!

28:02.873 --> 28:05.725
Get everybody
over the bridge!

28:05.727 --> 28:07.134
- Everyone, let's go. Let's go!
- Come on!

28:07.136 --> 28:09.286
- Come on.
- Let's go!

28:09.288 --> 28:11.138
Keep coming,
keep coming, keep coming!

28:11.140 --> 28:13.566
Remember, one
every 20 feet, Dwight!

28:13.568 --> 28:14.975
- Come on, come on!
- Come on, come on, come on!

28:14.977 --> 28:18.571
- Go, go!
- One at a time! Let's go!

28:18.573 --> 28:21.966
- They're breaking through!
- Hey, Morgan!

28:21.968 --> 28:24.393
Breach! Breach!

28:24.395 --> 28:26.913
Everyone, go! Run, run!

28:26.915 --> 28:28.489
Hyah!

28:34.422 --> 28:37.498
Everybody
get over the bridge!

28:37.500 --> 28:40.334
- Al, watch out!
- Make that the last bucket!

28:40.336 --> 28:41.594
Okay!

28:41.596 --> 28:43.245
- Sarah!
- Yeah.

28:43.247 --> 28:44.579
Get across the bridge!

28:44.581 --> 28:45.914
You don't need
to tell me twice!

28:45.916 --> 28:49.602
Let's go!

28:49.604 --> 28:51.145
Go, now, go!

28:51.147 --> 28:53.439
How are we doing
with the patch?!

28:53.441 --> 28:56.442
We're not ready yet!
We need more time!

28:59.948 --> 29:02.022
Tom, you go!
Just keep going!

29:02.024 --> 29:03.950
Forget about that!

29:03.952 --> 29:05.267
Aah!

29:07.956 --> 29:12.458
Aah!

29:21.694 --> 29:24.028
Come here.
Come on, Al!

29:24.030 --> 29:26.788
Is there any way we can get
the tanker over the patch?

29:26.790 --> 29:28.457
There's no way
it's gonna hold.

29:28.459 --> 29:30.292
Then we gotta go.

29:31.220 --> 29:32.645
Get on the other side!

29:32.647 --> 29:34.129
Tom, go!

29:34.131 --> 29:35.314
Just go!

29:35.316 --> 29:36.631
- Come on, everybody!
- Everybody.

29:36.633 --> 29:38.209
Tom, bail!

29:38.211 --> 29:40.894
No, I'm gonna get this!

29:49.196 --> 29:50.621
- Tom!
- Tom!

30:06.922 --> 30:09.515
Come on, man! Get over here!

30:09.517 --> 30:11.592
Come on!

30:11.594 --> 30:13.502
Tom! Leave it!

30:13.504 --> 30:15.021
I got it!

30:15.023 --> 30:17.264
People are gonna see
what we were doing was worth it!

30:18.842 --> 30:20.559
This is... This is proof.

30:21.879 --> 30:23.112
Aah!

30:27.684 --> 30:29.276
Al? Hey.

30:29.278 --> 30:31.686
I have to finish.
The batteries aren't gonna last.

30:41.865 --> 30:44.108
It's okay.

30:47.704 --> 30:50.631
We have to get this right.

30:50.633 --> 30:52.224
For us.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.542
For him.

30:53.544 --> 30:57.712
Then that's
what we'll do.

30:57.714 --> 30:59.356
And we will
get it right.

31:05.481 --> 31:07.490
Got any batteries left
for your camera?

31:15.474 --> 31:18.826
This is not
the end of the road, Al.

31:18.828 --> 31:20.086
I won't let it be.

31:24.092 --> 31:25.424
Come on.

31:25.426 --> 31:27.510
Everybody's waiting.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.783
How far do you think it is
to the Gulch?

31:50.785 --> 31:52.910
I don't know.
10, 15 miles?

31:55.848 --> 31:58.215
Hey.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.534
Can you walk?

32:00.536 --> 32:02.586
The fluids helped.

32:04.781 --> 32:07.282
- Morgan?
- Yeah.

32:07.284 --> 32:11.545
He died for the detour.

32:11.547 --> 32:13.264
For me.

32:39.909 --> 32:42.226
Do you maybe

32:42.228 --> 32:44.837
want me say a few words
before we go?

32:49.493 --> 32:51.510
Not here.

32:51.512 --> 32:53.754
There.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.426
I think I know
what we're all feeling,

32:59.428 --> 33:01.578
what we're thinking.

33:01.580 --> 33:05.173
Tom believed that this story...
our story...

33:05.175 --> 33:06.934
that it wasn't over yet.

33:06.936 --> 33:09.420
And he wanted
to be with people

33:09.422 --> 33:12.990
who would do what we did
for one of our own.

33:15.185 --> 33:17.669
And he wanted her
to know it.

33:17.671 --> 33:20.164
Wanted Virginia
to know that.

33:22.785 --> 33:24.101
That right, Janis?

33:27.122 --> 33:31.884
He said to finish it.

33:31.886 --> 33:33.685
That's what we should do.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.206
And that's what
we should do, right?

33:39.936 --> 33:41.185
Right?

33:43.364 --> 33:45.138
Yeah.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.035
Let's go.

34:07.255 --> 34:08.996
Really not gonna be easy.

35:07.982 --> 35:13.060
I've been thinking...

35:13.062 --> 35:15.970
when we get there...

35:15.972 --> 35:20.734
I'll paint with you.

35:20.736 --> 35:24.997
And it doesn't
just have to be trees.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
We might need a new medium.

35:57.089 --> 36:00.107
Rabbi, I don't know
if this is a good time

36:00.109 --> 36:01.425
to ask this question.

36:01.427 --> 36:04.536
That depends
on the question.

36:04.538 --> 36:07.447
Do you do weddings?

36:07.449 --> 36:10.191
For Gentiles?

36:10.193 --> 36:11.451
I've never been asked,

36:11.453 --> 36:13.879
but I've always
wanted to try one.

36:13.881 --> 36:16.632
All right.
Thank you.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.868
Did I hear
what I think I just heard?

36:19.870 --> 36:22.537
Ah.

36:22.539 --> 36:24.781
It's gonna be
a pretty quiet affair.

36:24.783 --> 36:27.226
- Okay.
- Yeah, given everything...

36:27.228 --> 36:30.729
don't want to make
a big deal.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.564
I don't know.

36:32.566 --> 36:34.733
I think it might just be
what everybody needs.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.217
You know?

36:36.219 --> 36:37.736
Remind them of why
we're doing this thing

36:37.738 --> 36:42.223
the way we're doing it.

36:42.225 --> 36:46.227
Well,
I'm gonna need a best man.

36:46.229 --> 36:47.579
So if you know anybody...

36:47.581 --> 36:51.658
...that's not busy.

36:51.660 --> 36:54.569
Yeah.

37:48.291 --> 37:49.791
Still filming, Al?

37:49.793 --> 37:51.459
As long as there's
a story to tell.

37:51.461 --> 37:54.128
Hey, Morgan.

37:54.130 --> 37:56.206
We don't know each other
that well,

37:56.208 --> 37:57.298
but hear me out.

37:57.300 --> 37:58.967
Okay.

37:58.969 --> 38:00.652
None of us has any idea

38:00.654 --> 38:03.547
how long we have left
in this world.

38:03.549 --> 38:08.735
So, if there's things
to say,

38:08.737 --> 38:11.330
you should say them.

38:23.569 --> 38:25.235
Hey, Al!

38:25.237 --> 38:27.012
You gettin' this?

38:27.014 --> 38:29.330
You bet I am.

38:49.595 --> 38:50.852
Huh.

38:52.373 --> 38:56.691
I want Ginny to see this.

38:56.693 --> 38:59.678
I want her to see
why she lost.

39:23.979 --> 39:26.980
You good
for one last push?

39:26.982 --> 39:30.967
Yeah, Morgan, I am.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.469
You know,
I, um, wanted to say...

39:32.471 --> 39:33.561
Don't... Don't say it.

39:33.563 --> 39:34.538
- Just...
- Don't.

39:36.566 --> 39:38.183
It'll only
make things harder.

39:45.909 --> 39:47.551
I just...

39:50.097 --> 39:52.397
I'm glad you're here
to see this.

39:52.399 --> 39:54.491
Me too.

40:16.348 --> 40:19.516
We made it.

40:34.366 --> 40:36.341
No.

40:36.343 --> 40:38.702
No, t-this can't be it.
This is the wrong place.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.316
There's passed
at every gate.

40:44.318 --> 40:46.318
We'll be hard-pressed
to even get inside.

40:49.898 --> 40:52.716
- We'll find another way.
- How?

40:52.718 --> 40:54.475
We have no food,
no water.

40:54.477 --> 40:55.886
All of our supplies

40:55.888 --> 40:58.296
we left on the other side
of that bridge.

40:58.298 --> 41:01.558
There's...

41:01.560 --> 41:03.134
There's nothing else
around here.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.731
Your faith got us
this far.

41:07.733 --> 41:09.733
We need more than faith
right how.

41:09.735 --> 41:10.992
But we can't just
give up.

41:10.994 --> 41:12.660
Not with what
we just went through,

41:12.662 --> 41:14.462
what Tom did.

41:14.464 --> 41:15.681
We've got to do something.

41:15.683 --> 41:16.998
Okay. Like what?

41:17.000 --> 41:19.426
We could walk back
to the cars.

41:19.428 --> 41:21.019
We'd never make it.

41:21.021 --> 41:22.521
Look at us.

41:22.523 --> 41:25.006
We barely made it here.

41:25.008 --> 41:26.382
Ain't no gas in 'em
anyway.

41:28.921 --> 41:30.320
There is one thing
we can do.

41:32.165 --> 41:34.257
- No. Hell no.
- Then what?

41:34.259 --> 41:35.942
What?!

41:35.944 --> 41:37.852
Why'd you turn
your camera off?

41:37.854 --> 41:39.204
You don't want
to show things the way

41:39.206 --> 41:40.539
they really are now,
do you?

41:40.541 --> 41:42.115
Because you see
the way things are,

41:42.117 --> 41:44.100
just like I'm seeing things
the way they are.

41:44.102 --> 41:46.770
We've gotten somewhere.

41:46.772 --> 41:49.030
To something.

41:49.032 --> 41:50.674
And here we are...
we've arrived at it.

41:52.720 --> 41:55.628
There's sick people here,
children.

41:55.630 --> 41:59.057
You deal in the truth.

41:59.059 --> 42:00.967
We can eat tonight.

42:00.969 --> 42:02.978
We can live for tomorrow.

42:06.808 --> 42:08.808
If you can think
of something else,

42:08.810 --> 42:10.460
tell me now.

42:10.462 --> 42:14.239
Anybody.

42:14.241 --> 42:15.907
Say it now.

42:28.313 --> 42:30.589
Morgan, I thought this was
gonna go differently.

42:30.591 --> 42:33.383
I thought it wasn't
the end of the story.

42:37.264 --> 42:38.555
But it is.

42:42.744 --> 42:44.995
I know what that means.

42:44.997 --> 42:50.667
You call her,
there's no going back.

42:50.669 --> 42:52.527
People are gonna die.

42:54.581 --> 42:57.007
We tried a different way.

42:57.009 --> 42:59.267
We didn't
run into her arms.

42:59.269 --> 43:00.786
We can look at ourselves
in the mirror tomorrow.

43:00.788 --> 43:02.603
Maybe tomorrow.

43:02.605 --> 43:05.365
But if you throw in with her,
with them...

43:05.367 --> 43:06.792
day'll come
when you can't.

43:09.429 --> 43:12.038
Dwight, don't walk away.

43:12.040 --> 43:13.799
We're miles
from anywhere anyway.

43:13.801 --> 43:15.801
I've walked further
than this before.

43:18.438 --> 43:21.865
Dwight. Come on.

43:30.709 --> 43:31.942
I'm sorry.

43:34.637 --> 43:36.229
No, no,
it's not your fault.

43:36.231 --> 43:38.289
We all thought
this was a good call.

43:47.334 --> 43:50.577
If we're gonna
do this...

43:50.579 --> 43:52.729
we should do it.

44:08.430 --> 44:09.813
Janis...

44:13.752 --> 44:15.485
...Really am sorry.

44:24.187 --> 44:26.613
Virginia...

44:26.615 --> 44:28.615
if you're listening,

44:28.617 --> 44:30.433
we need your help.
