19:36.442 --> 19:37.375
IT'S EASY.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.677
JUST TEAR
THIS WALLPAPER OFF.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.711
(<i> guffaws</i> )

19:40.713 --> 19:43.147
OH, LOOK,
YOU MISSED SOME.

19:43.149 --> 19:43.848
OH, LET'S SEE.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.850
IT'S A COMIC BOOK,
AND LOOK AT THIS--

19:45.852 --> 19:48.819
IT'S THE ORIGIN
OF THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.254
IT SAYS WHEN HE DIED

19:50.256 --> 19:52.957
THEY USED HIS BODY
AS A WINDOW DISPLAY.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.759
NOW HE HAUNTS
THE SEVEN SEAS

19:54.761 --> 19:56.994
BECAUSE HE WAS
NEVER PUT TO REST.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.297
WELL, DON'T YOU
GET IT, PATRICK?

19:59.299 --> 20:00.998
WE'RE GOING
TO GO SHOPPING?

20:01.000 --> 20:01.732
NO! WE'RE GOING

20:01.734 --> 20:04.569
TO PUT POOR OLD
SQUIDWARD TO REST.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.272
OW! WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?

20:08.274 --> 20:09.307
INITIATION.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.041
(<i> giggles</i> )

20:10.043 --> 20:12.310
THAT WAS PART ONE
OF YOUR CEREMONY.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.411
CEREMONY FOR WHAT?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.746
WE'RE GOING
TO PUT YOU TO REST.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.015
I DON'T WANT
TO BE PUT TO REST!

20:18.017 --> 20:19.750
ALL I WANT ARE
THOSE CHORES DONE.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.320
NOW, DID YOU CLEAN
THE BACK ROOM YET?

20:22.322 --> 20:23.221
YEAH.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.088
OH, REALLY?

20:24.090 --> 20:25.990
I'M GOING TO GO CHECK.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.792
(<i> screams</i> )

20:27.794 --> 20:28.793
OKAY, GET IN.

20:28.795 --> 20:29.694
ARE YOU CRAZY?

20:29.696 --> 20:30.628
I'M NOT GETTING IN.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.964
BUT YOU SAID WE COULD
PUT YOU TO REST.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.999
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.535
NOW, GET OUT
OF MY HOUSE!

20:37.537 --> 20:38.803
OKAY.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.005
(<i> door closes</i> )

20:41.641 --> 20:42.740
(<i> sighs</i> )

20:42.742 --> 20:44.542
NOW WHAT?

20:44.844 --> 20:46.510
I WROTE
"HERE LIES SQUIDWARD.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.879
YOU MAY NOT
REMEMBER HIM, BUT..."

20:48.881 --> 20:49.981
(<i> screams</i> )

20:49.983 --> 20:51.182
OH, HI, SQUIDWARD.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.617
DOES THIS LOOK
DEEP ENOUGH?

20:52.619 --> 20:54.518
SPONGEBOB,
CUT THAT OUT!

20:54.520 --> 20:56.520
SpongeBob:
OH, LOOK, THE MOURNERS.

20:56.522 --> 20:57.755
OH, SQUIDWARD, WE ALL CAME

20:57.757 --> 21:00.091
AS SOON AS WE WERE
SURE YOU WERE DEAD.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.361
SPONGEBOB, ARE YOU
TRYING TO PUT ME

21:03.363 --> 21:04.595
IN THE NUTHOUSE?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.397
NO, JUST
INTO THIS HOLE.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.466
(<i> groaning</i> )

21:08.468 --> 21:09.166
(<i> sighs</i> )

21:09.168 --> 21:12.703
SPONGEBOB, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.771
(<i> squeals</i> )

21:13.773 --> 21:15.039
YOU'RE BALD?

21:15.041 --> 21:16.874
NO, I'M NOT BALD!

21:16.876 --> 21:18.309
I'M ALIVE!

21:18.311 --> 21:19.910
NOW, GET RID
OF THAT TOMBSTONE

21:19.912 --> 21:22.713
AND TELL ALL YOUR
FRIENDS TO GO HOME.

21:22.715 --> 21:23.748
GO HOME.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.684
(<i> all grumbling</i> )

21:27.687 --> 21:28.686
BUT I...

21:28.688 --> 21:29.520
MASTER...

21:29.522 --> 21:31.022
I'M NOT YOUR MASTER.

21:31.024 --> 21:32.890
I'M YOUR NEIGHBOR.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.325
NOW, DO ME A FAVOR

21:34.327 --> 21:37.295
AND STOP DOING ME FAVORS!

21:38.331 --> 21:40.598
AS YOU WISH, MASTER.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.832
D'OH!

21:41.834 --> 21:44.368
BOY, HE REALLY
HAD US FOOLED.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.637
NO, PATRICK,
HE'S THE FOOL.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.406
HE'S A GHOST IN DENIAL.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.941
HE NEEDS US NOW MORE THAN EVER.

21:50.943 --> 21:51.742
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.912
HE REALLY NEEDS TO GET
UP TO THE GREAT BEYOND.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.414
PATRICK,
SAY THAT AGAIN.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.281
THAT AGAIN.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.349
NO, THE OTHER THING.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.216
NO, THE OTHER THING.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.918
NO, WHAT YOU SAID
BEFORE WHEN...

22:00.920 --> 22:02.987
NO, WHAT YOU SAID
BEFORE WHEN...

22:02.989 --> 22:04.021
NEVER MIND!

22:04.023 --> 22:05.156
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.658
NEVER MIND,
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.227
(<i> somebody exhaling</i> )

22:10.229 --> 22:12.963
SpongeBob
(<i> whispering</i> ):
I CAN'T REACH HIM.

22:12.965 --> 22:13.898
Patrick:
BLOW HARDER.

22:13.900 --> 22:18.269
(<i> SpongeBob</i>
<i>exhaling again</i> )

22:18.271 --> 22:20.771
Patrick:
THERE HE GOES!

22:20.773 --> 22:21.706
(<i> sniffles</i> )

22:21.708 --> 22:23.174
ISN'T HE BEAUTIFUL?

22:23.176 --> 22:24.942
HOW HIGH'S
HE GOING TO GO?

22:24.944 --> 22:29.013
ALL THE WAY, PATRICK,
UP TO THE GREAT BEYOND.

22:29.015 --> 22:29.980
(<i> sniffles</i> )

22:29.982 --> 22:32.049
GOOD-BYE, FRIEND.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.751
HAPPY TRAILS!

22:33.753 --> 22:37.755
(<i> yelling angrily</i> )

22:37.757 --> 22:41.659
YOU'RE WELCOME!
YOU'RE WELCOME!

22:43.730 --> 22:46.030
HE'S ON
THE OTHER SIDE NOW.

22:46.032 --> 22:46.731
YEAH.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.533
HE'S IN
A BETTER PLACE.
