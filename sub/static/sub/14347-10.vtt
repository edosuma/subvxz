00:25.707 --> 00:27.505
You're bangin' my wife, huh?

00:27.540 --> 00:29.539
- No. No.
- What do you got to say for yourself?

00:29.574 --> 00:30.704
No, no, no, let me explain.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.537
Tommy, listen,
I heard it in your voice, okay?

00:32.573 --> 00:33.771
I saw it in your eyes.

00:33.810 --> 00:36.512
Listen, okay? You don't know
what you're talking about.

00:36.573 --> 00:37.669
She wanted me to--

00:37.704 --> 00:39.735
- Bullshit! Bullshit!
- Not bullshit!

00:39.770 --> 00:42.002
You wanna explain
how sweet her tits tasted?

00:42.037 --> 00:43.969
Is that it, you scumbag?

00:44.004 --> 00:45.652
My cousin, my best friend!

00:45.687 --> 00:47.266
I am your best friend.

00:47.301 --> 00:48.702
You're a worthless
piece of shit.

00:48.737 --> 00:49.702
Don't do this, Jimmy!

00:55.466 --> 00:57.566
Burn in hell, asshole.

01:00.964 --> 01:02.198
What are you doing?

01:02.233 --> 01:03.497
Oh.

01:03.532 --> 01:05.697
Oh, I-- I had a bad dream.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.828
I was at the door knocking,

01:07.863 --> 01:09.463
and you said something
about being on fire.

01:09.498 --> 01:11.263
In the dream I was...
I was on fire.

01:12.330 --> 01:13.594
It's okay, Asshole.
It's okay.

01:13.629 --> 01:15.079
What, were you drinking
last night?

01:15.114 --> 01:16.521
No, no, no.
Here you go, Asshole.

01:16.556 --> 01:17.928
Good boy, Asshole.
Get on the couch.

01:17.963 --> 01:19.661
- "Asshole"?
- He likes it.

01:19.696 --> 01:21.825
Whew.

01:21.860 --> 01:23.493
You want
some coffee?

01:23.528 --> 01:25.225
No.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.642
Tom, I went to
the mall last night

01:26.677 --> 01:27.990
and tried
to charge something,

01:28.025 --> 01:30.059
and not only did they refuse
my MasterCard.

01:30.094 --> 01:31.559
They also refused my Amex.

01:31.594 --> 01:33.024
Okay, and then
I get a call

01:33.059 --> 01:34.290
from the bank,

01:34.325 --> 01:36.324
saying that you're late
on two of the car payments

01:36.359 --> 01:37.724
and on a mortgage payment.

01:37.759 --> 01:39.055
- Shit.
- What is going on?

01:39.090 --> 01:40.589
I'm sorry.
I screwed up. Shit.

01:40.624 --> 01:42.440
Okay, well, I need
at least four grand

01:42.475 --> 01:44.256
just to make the mortgage,
the car

01:44.291 --> 01:45.353
and the Amex.

01:45.388 --> 01:47.088
Well, where am I gonna get
four grand?

01:47.123 --> 01:48.588
Well, what about your side jobs?

01:48.623 --> 01:49.786
I got nothing this week.

01:49.821 --> 01:51.421
I mean, next week
I got two roofs.

01:51.456 --> 01:53.152
I'm installing a pool.

01:53.187 --> 01:55.119
I'm golden next week,
but this week's just--

01:56.119 --> 01:57.852
What?

01:59.485 --> 02:01.351
Nothing.

02:01.386 --> 02:03.183
You know...

02:03.218 --> 02:05.634
the kids go to school
at what, 8?

02:05.669 --> 02:08.050
And then between
soccer and baseball

02:08.085 --> 02:09.181
and the other bullshit,

02:09.216 --> 02:11.015
you don't pick 'em up
till what, 4:30?

02:11.050 --> 02:12.383
So you can't take a job,

02:12.418 --> 02:13.681
even a part-time job?

02:13.716 --> 02:16.115
Yeah, I suppose that I could
hire a housekeeper

02:16.150 --> 02:17.532
to sort of clean up
after the kids

02:17.567 --> 02:18.941
and vacuum
and do the laundry.

02:18.976 --> 02:20.315
Right, but then
I'd have to hire

02:20.350 --> 02:21.513
a cook, you know,

02:21.548 --> 02:23.497
to make the lunches
and breakfast and dinner,

02:23.532 --> 02:25.447
and then with the salary
that I was getting,

02:25.482 --> 02:27.177
I think I probably
would've spent that

02:27.212 --> 02:30.279
paying out my two new,
probably Mexican, employees,

02:30.314 --> 02:31.677
who would pretty much destroy

02:31.712 --> 02:33.876
the entire foundation
of my household system

02:33.911 --> 02:36.177
because they can't understand
a word of goddamn English.

02:37.611 --> 02:39.376
All right.

02:39.411 --> 02:42.343
The foundation
of your household system.

02:42.368 --> 02:44.934
You know, I never
should've gotten you

02:44.958 --> 02:46.684
that giant goddamn house
across the street.

02:46.723 --> 02:48.291
I shoulda gotten you
the smaller house--

02:48.311 --> 02:50.491
- No, no, you wanted the big house--
- Bullshit!

02:50.541 --> 02:52.141
I wanted things
to be easier for you.

02:52.176 --> 02:53.106
For dropping
the kids off

02:53.141 --> 02:54.507
and baby-sitting and everything,

02:54.542 --> 02:55.838
I wanted
the easiest thing--

02:55.873 --> 02:58.072
Tommy, all that I wanted
was a house big enough

02:58.107 --> 02:59.104
for three kids, okay?

02:59.139 --> 03:00.539
They could each have
their own room,

03:00.574 --> 03:01.770
and we could
grow up normal.

03:01.805 --> 03:04.306
Hey, six kids in my family.
We had two bedrooms.

03:04.336 --> 03:05.834
Shared them
with your three brothers.

03:05.863 --> 03:07.419
I know the poor-ass Irish story
by heart!

03:07.472 --> 03:09.003
- It's true!
- Okay, who cares, okay?

03:09.038 --> 03:09.968
I care!

03:10.003 --> 03:11.802
- I ended up across the street.
- Yeah.

03:11.838 --> 03:14.705
And you ended up spying on me
and ruining my relationship with Roger.

03:14.770 --> 03:16.769
Roger was an asshole.
I saved you so much trouble--

03:16.804 --> 03:17.769
You had no right!

03:17.804 --> 03:19.702
Goddamn you!

03:24.100 --> 03:25.466
I thought I was helping.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.299
If you wanna help, Tommy,

03:29.334 --> 03:31.432
then get me the 4000.

03:31.467 --> 03:33.465
Fast.

03:37.464 --> 03:38.698
Stupid bitch.

03:41.863 --> 03:44.262
Fucking asshole!

03:50.028 --> 03:51.627
Aw, shit.

03:51.662 --> 03:53.227
Goddamn it.

03:55.127 --> 03:56.127
Shit.

04:00.126 --> 04:01.158
Hey, how you doin'?

04:01.193 --> 04:02.156
Hey, Collins, man.

04:02.191 --> 04:03.692
You better have
a good excuse, Gavin.

04:03.727 --> 04:04.889
I got a phone call--

04:04.924 --> 04:06.724
That was some daredevil shit
back there.

04:06.759 --> 04:07.822
I know, I know.

04:07.857 --> 04:09.658
I got a phone call
about 20 minutes ago.

04:09.693 --> 04:10.954
My mom had a heart attack.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.789
- Bullshit.
- No, bro, I'm serious.

04:12.824 --> 04:13.954
Gimme your license and reg.

04:13.989 --> 04:15.888
The honeymoon's over,
Gavin, all right?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.153
So tell
all your friends,

04:17.188 --> 04:19.254
all that hero-worshipping
you got after 9/11

04:19.289 --> 04:21.321
ain't getting paid any due
from us anymore.

04:21.356 --> 04:22.686
We lost guys
downtown too,

04:22.721 --> 04:24.719
but nobody ever
talks about us.

04:24.754 --> 04:27.053
"Three hundred and forty-three
firemen."

04:27.088 --> 04:29.184
There was almost 100 cops.

04:29.219 --> 04:31.386
- Nobody's forgettin' about the cops.
- Guess what:

04:31.421 --> 04:33.784
you so as much look at a cop
the wrong way

04:33.819 --> 04:35.051
and you're paying
the price.

04:35.086 --> 04:36.049
All right, asshole?

04:36.084 --> 04:37.583
You know,
this is gonna come back

04:37.618 --> 04:39.048
to bite you in the ass,
you know?

04:39.083 --> 04:41.484
We got a big hockey game
comin' up again in a week.

04:41.519 --> 04:44.981
Yeah, I'm real concerned
about payback.

04:45.016 --> 04:47.682
Yeah, I hope your ma don't die
while I'm writing you up either.

04:47.717 --> 04:48.649
Have a nice day.

04:50.215 --> 04:51.548
Shithead.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.416
IMMORTAL

05:45.869 --> 05:47.400
Hey, you're early.

05:47.435 --> 05:49.334
Tour doesn't start
for a half-hour.

05:49.369 --> 05:51.234
Yeah, I wanted
to get acclimated.

05:51.269 --> 05:53.233
Um, chief,
in my last house,

05:53.268 --> 05:54.668
they gave me
my own sleeping quarters.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.365
No problem.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.833
And they also gave me
my own bathroom.

06:01.566 --> 06:02.763
I can't really
be expected

06:02.798 --> 06:04.796
to shower and shave
with the rest of the guys.

06:04.831 --> 06:08.431
Look, you wanna fight fires
with these guys, right?

06:08.466 --> 06:09.748
Side by side?

06:09.783 --> 06:11.030
Life and death?

06:11.065 --> 06:12.095
Right.

06:12.130 --> 06:14.363
Well, then maybe
you should figure out

06:14.398 --> 06:15.696
where and when
to take a shit.

06:17.029 --> 06:17.995
Okay.

06:18.030 --> 06:18.961
Ahem.

06:20.362 --> 06:22.362
Weren't you recently
brought up on charges

06:22.397 --> 06:24.494
for beating
a gay ex-firefighter

06:24.529 --> 06:26.427
into a near coma?

06:27.493 --> 06:28.824
Yeah.

06:28.859 --> 06:30.258
And wasn't it that

06:30.293 --> 06:32.225
and a few other nefarious
bits of behavior

06:32.260 --> 06:34.192
that put this house
in the spotlight,

06:34.227 --> 06:36.125
and is the reason
why I came here

06:36.160 --> 06:37.757
after Billy Warren's death?

06:37.792 --> 06:39.289
Right.

06:39.324 --> 06:41.190
So could you imagine
the stink it would cause

06:41.225 --> 06:42.288
if I called headquarters

06:42.323 --> 06:43.923
and said I was getting
the cold shoulder

06:43.958 --> 06:45.288
from Chief Reilly,

06:45.323 --> 06:48.755
over something as stupid
as a personal-hygiene issue?

06:48.790 --> 06:50.688
Thanks.

07:01.286 --> 07:02.551
Hello.

07:02.586 --> 07:04.752
Dad, Jennifer still won't
call me back.

07:04.787 --> 07:06.918
Honey, you gotta give it
some time, okay?

07:06.953 --> 07:08.249
I see her in the hallway,

07:08.284 --> 07:10.284
and then she turns and heads
into the other direction.

07:10.319 --> 07:11.249
I--

07:11.284 --> 07:13.749
I think I'm in love, Dad.

07:14.650 --> 07:16.183
All right, well,
you know what?

07:16.218 --> 07:17.683
Gimme her
cell phone number.

07:17.718 --> 07:19.113
She doesn't have
a cell phone.

07:19.148 --> 07:20.748
Well, then gimme
her home phone number.

07:20.783 --> 07:22.079
What are you gonna do?

07:22.114 --> 07:24.248
What if her mother
answers?

07:24.283 --> 07:25.446
Is her mom a lesbian?

07:25.481 --> 07:28.013
No, she's separated,
just like you and Mom.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.744
Okay, and is she
particularly happy

07:29.779 --> 07:31.495
that her daughter's
dating another girl?

07:31.530 --> 07:33.212
Oh, my God. She, like,
hates my guts.

07:33.247 --> 07:34.377
Perfect.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.511
Let me get a pen.

07:35.546 --> 07:37.510
Hey, Mike.

07:37.545 --> 07:40.210
Hey, don't start any shit, Andy!
The guys are right inside.

07:40.245 --> 07:41.727
I don't wanna
start any, Mike.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.186
Let me talk to you
for a minute.

07:43.221 --> 07:44.465
Mike, just let me
talk to you--

07:44.500 --> 07:46.038
Hey, Mike.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:46.073 --> 07:47.541
Hey, Mike, what's up?
You okay?

07:47.576 --> 07:49.275
Look, guys, I don't
want a problem, all right?

07:49.310 --> 07:50.975
Hey, guys, I'm not here
to start anything.

07:51.010 --> 07:52.192
Want me
to kick this guy's ass?

07:52.227 --> 07:53.867
It's all right, guys.

07:53.902 --> 07:55.472
I'm such an asshole. God!

07:55.507 --> 07:57.873
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
argue with you on that front.

07:57.908 --> 08:00.173
Geneva totally freaked out
about what happened.

08:00.208 --> 08:01.640
She moved out.

08:01.675 --> 08:03.072
Shit. Really?

08:03.107 --> 08:04.204
Yeah.

08:04.239 --> 08:05.404
I was in love with her,

08:05.439 --> 08:08.171
but she totally
twisted my head around.

08:08.206 --> 08:10.904
I mean-- I didn't know
what I was doing.

08:10.939 --> 08:13.204
I never wanted
to hurt you.

08:13.239 --> 08:15.637
I just...
I was all screwed up.

08:15.672 --> 08:18.035
I-- I'm a conscientious
objector.

08:18.070 --> 08:19.201
What?

08:19.236 --> 08:20.999
I'm a conscientious objector.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.933
I've never hurt anyone
in my life.

08:23.968 --> 08:26.833
Dude, I just wanted
to make amends

08:26.868 --> 08:27.932
with you, all right?

08:27.967 --> 08:30.700
You saved my life, and I--

08:30.735 --> 08:32.350
I screwed yours up.

08:32.385 --> 08:33.966
Yeah, and your own.

08:34.001 --> 08:35.232
Hey!

08:36.698 --> 08:38.230
What's goin' on?

08:38.265 --> 08:39.929
You still
sleepin' here?

08:39.964 --> 08:42.462
Yeah, I can't get
a cheap new place.

08:42.496 --> 08:44.230
Uh-huh. You know,
find another 40-year-old broad

08:44.265 --> 08:45.997
and start bangin' her.

08:46.032 --> 08:47.729
Her, not her daughter.

08:47.764 --> 08:49.546
You cool?

08:49.581 --> 08:51.294
Yeah.

08:51.329 --> 08:52.562
Thanks, Tommy.

08:52.597 --> 08:55.026
Dude...

08:55.061 --> 08:56.992
Dude, I totally get it.

08:57.027 --> 08:59.594
I was meant to come down here
this morning.

08:59.629 --> 09:01.627
You are moving in
with me.

09:01.662 --> 09:02.723
- No, I can't.
- Yes!

09:02.758 --> 09:03.990
You are moving in
with me.

09:04.025 --> 09:06.757
I will take the bedroom,
and you can have the couch.

09:06.792 --> 09:07.989
No--

09:08.024 --> 09:09.757
Bro, it's free
of charge!

09:09.792 --> 09:11.155
You saved my life.

09:11.190 --> 09:12.455
We are totally doing this.

09:12.490 --> 09:14.022
It's not even up for discussion.

09:14.057 --> 09:16.323
Well, maybe till
I just get on my feet.

09:16.358 --> 09:17.623
Till you get
on your feet.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.889
See, I totally get it, dude!

09:18.924 --> 09:19.889
Go high, bro.

09:19.924 --> 09:20.988
Hey!

09:22.121 --> 09:23.455
Great.

09:24.655 --> 09:26.138
You know,
these goddamn Jets,

09:26.173 --> 09:27.621
it's like
they all have vaginas.

09:27.656 --> 09:28.619
Yeah.

09:28.654 --> 09:30.053
Hey, you got
any roofing jobs

09:30.088 --> 09:31.318
comin' up
this weekend?

09:31.353 --> 09:32.717
Yeah, but you know,
I already got

09:32.752 --> 09:34.851
Franco and Garrity
and my brother-in-law.

09:34.886 --> 09:36.117
Ah...

09:36.152 --> 09:37.586
What's the matter,
you need some cash?

09:37.621 --> 09:38.919
Yeah, four G's.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.218
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

09:48.482 --> 09:50.449
You're not gonna
get that?

09:50.484 --> 09:51.813
No.

09:51.848 --> 09:53.781
Is that the name
"Sondra"

09:53.816 --> 09:55.714
that popped up
on there?

09:55.749 --> 09:57.314
Yeah.

09:58.547 --> 10:00.147
Would that be Billy's ex,

10:00.182 --> 10:01.146
that Sondra?

10:01.181 --> 10:02.111
Yeah.

10:02.146 --> 10:03.529
Hey, you know, uh,

10:03.564 --> 10:04.877
she was a widow

10:04.912 --> 10:06.512
in only the most technical
of terms, okay?

10:06.547 --> 10:07.712
They were married

10:07.747 --> 10:09.145
for six weeks.

10:09.180 --> 10:10.544
Okay, Columbo?

10:10.579 --> 10:11.509
Fine.

10:11.544 --> 10:12.810
Not like it matters to me.

10:12.845 --> 10:14.742
Obviously not.

10:19.043 --> 10:20.007
Hey.

10:20.042 --> 10:21.075
Hey, Frank,
what's up?

10:21.110 --> 10:22.142
One guess.

10:22.177 --> 10:23.807
Um...

10:26.041 --> 10:27.373
Twins.

10:27.408 --> 10:28.540
The Minnesota Twins?

10:28.575 --> 10:29.807
No, twins.

10:29.842 --> 10:31.005
Twins, Sean.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.572
Both of whom
saw an advance preview

10:32.607 --> 10:34.756
of the calendar
on the Internet the other day.

10:34.791 --> 10:36.905
One of whom's very attracted
to guess who?

10:36.940 --> 10:39.071
Uh... "Whom?"

10:40.605 --> 10:42.504
Right. Uh, you.

10:42.544 --> 10:44.085
- Really?
- Really.

10:44.124 --> 10:46.208
Wait a second. We're talking
about women now, right?

10:46.239 --> 10:48.201
Yeah, yeah.
Hot-blooded American twin women.

10:48.236 --> 10:50.236
'Cause the Internet, Frank.
I was reading in the papers,

10:50.271 --> 10:52.202
it's like a hotbed for,
you know, gay sex

10:52.237 --> 10:53.333
and transvestites

10:53.368 --> 10:55.202
and chicks with dicks
and men with tits.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.166
It's really bad.

10:56.201 --> 10:57.499
Hey. No, no, no.
Listen, man.

10:57.534 --> 10:59.517
These are chicks, goddamn it,
okay? Chicks with tits.

10:59.552 --> 11:01.359
Trust me, the only dicks
involved in the equation

11:01.394 --> 11:03.166
will be yours and mine,
separately, of course.

11:03.201 --> 11:04.498
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.696
Don't you remember this, Sean?

11:05.731 --> 11:07.531
I met these two chicks
at the bar that night?

11:07.566 --> 11:09.331
Heather and Brittany?
I gave them my number.

11:09.366 --> 11:10.830
They saw some shots
of the calendar.

11:10.865 --> 11:13.587
They called me last night. Heather
wants me, and Brittany wants you.

11:13.615 --> 11:15.183
Oh, Brittany. Is she cute?

11:15.208 --> 11:17.715
Yeah, 5'11"
raven-haired blue-eyed hottie

11:17.761 --> 11:20.245
with an ass like Elizabeth Hurley's?
Yeah, I'd say she's cute.

11:20.329 --> 11:21.693
It sounds like
you wanna bang her.

11:21.728 --> 11:23.493
No, I do, but, you know,
they're identical twins.

11:23.528 --> 11:26.294
I don't care which one I get.
They're both unbelievable.

11:26.329 --> 11:29.060
Let's just make sure early on
they don't have Adam's apples.

11:29.095 --> 11:30.025
All right.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.194
Or even,
you know, cocks.

11:31.229 --> 11:32.692
Sorry to interrupt.

11:32.727 --> 11:33.657
Hi.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.859
Uh, we were just
talking about--

11:35.894 --> 11:37.856
Cocks. I heard.

11:37.891 --> 11:39.458
No, no. Not our cocks.
These girls--

11:39.493 --> 11:41.224
Uh, they don't have cocks.

11:41.259 --> 11:42.955
I don't really care.

11:42.990 --> 11:44.506
Gentlemen,
please welcome...

11:44.541 --> 11:46.023
- the bowler.
- I like it.

11:46.058 --> 11:47.288
Hey, it's not bad.

11:47.323 --> 11:48.722
I found that for Lou. Huh?

11:48.757 --> 11:49.988
Nice.

11:50.023 --> 11:52.022
Anybody got any jobs coming up
this weekend, you know?

11:52.057 --> 11:53.155
Roofing, landscaping, anything?

11:53.190 --> 11:54.187
Lou has a roof.

11:54.222 --> 11:56.019
No, I talked to him.
He's full up.

11:56.054 --> 11:57.804
You know what?
Danny Keough over at 71 Truck,

11:57.839 --> 11:59.554
he's doing a garage
or something this weekend,

11:59.589 --> 12:00.654
he might need
some guys.

12:00.689 --> 12:01.719
Oh, yeah?
How many guys?

12:01.754 --> 12:03.286
What are you doing?

12:03.321 --> 12:04.783
Making a sandwich.

12:04.818 --> 12:05.984
That's not
a sandwich.

12:06.019 --> 12:07.752
That's an introduction
to colon cancer.

12:07.787 --> 12:08.716
Huh?

12:08.751 --> 12:10.084
Here. I brought my own stuff.

12:10.119 --> 12:12.283
May I?

12:12.318 --> 12:14.651
Yeah, be my guest.

12:18.149 --> 12:19.599
The Jets look like shit
this year.

12:19.634 --> 12:21.091
Yeah, I know, but, you know,

12:21.126 --> 12:22.514
you gotta give 'em some time.

12:22.549 --> 12:24.181
The Giants look great, though.

12:24.216 --> 12:25.779
Yeah... I think Manning's a bum.

12:25.814 --> 12:27.847
Did you guys see what Bush
said about Kerry?

12:27.882 --> 12:28.780
Ow! What?

12:32.013 --> 12:33.245
I don't know.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.879
I think I'm gonna stick
with my Packers.

12:34.914 --> 12:36.612
Well, Favre,
he's an animal.

12:36.647 --> 12:37.943
Yeah.

12:37.978 --> 12:40.378
I know you guys are talking
about my tits and my ass.

12:40.413 --> 12:41.611
Just in case
you're wondering,

12:41.646 --> 12:43.742
I'm a 34-C cup.

12:43.777 --> 12:46.776
My nipples are slightly larger
than average

12:46.811 --> 12:49.775
and stand up like top hats
when aroused.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.376
My ass is as tight

12:51.411 --> 12:52.907
as a snare drum

12:52.942 --> 12:55.441
and still
soft to the touch.

12:55.476 --> 12:56.706
Wow.

12:56.741 --> 12:58.006
Any other questions?

12:58.041 --> 12:59.440
Yeah. Can I get one of those?

12:59.475 --> 13:00.905
No.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.905
Wow, look at that thing.

13:02.940 --> 13:06.039
Did she just say
"top hats"?

13:06.074 --> 13:07.238
I believe she did.

13:07.273 --> 13:09.071
I've always been
a big fan of formal wear.

13:09.106 --> 13:10.103
Oh, I know you have.

13:10.138 --> 13:11.703
Here we go!

13:11.738 --> 13:13.002
What'd I tell you?

13:13.037 --> 13:14.436
I told you
she liked me, right?

13:14.471 --> 13:16.471
She gave you a sandwich,
not a blow job, asshole.

13:16.506 --> 13:18.069
Hey, this sandwich
is not a sandwich, okay?

13:18.104 --> 13:19.669
This sandwich is a...
It's a symbol.

13:24.469 --> 13:25.966
Mm!

13:26.001 --> 13:27.266
You know what?

13:27.301 --> 13:29.568
This is one of the best
goddamn sandwiches I ever had.

13:29.603 --> 13:30.784
Wow.

13:30.819 --> 13:31.931
Thanks.

13:31.966 --> 13:33.766
You're not worried
about getting a stomachache?

13:33.801 --> 13:34.930
Why?

13:34.965 --> 13:36.599
Because we're on our way
to a fire.

13:36.634 --> 13:38.964
Sweetheart, I'm golden.

13:38.999 --> 13:42.365
I could eat a whole pizza,
five plates of shrimp tempura,

13:42.400 --> 13:43.662
16 red-hot hotdogs,

13:43.697 --> 13:45.097
and still run
right into the bitch.

13:45.132 --> 13:47.395
Superman, huh?

13:47.430 --> 13:48.913
Battalion
1-5 to 1-5 Alpha.

13:48.948 --> 13:50.361
I'm gonna give you a size-up.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.196
The number one exposure
is out in the street.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.427
The number two exposure

13:53.462 --> 13:56.244
is a vacant parking lot
on the left-hand side.

13:56.279 --> 13:59.027
We have smoke pushing out
of all three floors.

13:59.062 --> 14:01.194
Ah! Help me!

14:01.229 --> 14:03.291
Please help me!

14:03.326 --> 14:06.226
So much smoke!
Please, I don't wanna die!

14:06.261 --> 14:08.758
Battalion 1-5...

14:08.793 --> 14:10.457
Aah!

14:10.492 --> 14:12.324
We got a female victim
on the top floor.

14:12.359 --> 14:13.341
Let's go.

14:13.376 --> 14:14.289
Help me!

14:14.324 --> 14:16.489
Somebody, hurry!

14:16.524 --> 14:17.990
They're gonna have your ass, Gavin.

14:19.123 --> 14:20.523
What do you think
you're doing, Tommy?

14:20.558 --> 14:22.173
What the hell is he doing?

14:22.208 --> 14:23.753
Tommy!
Son of a bitch.

14:23.788 --> 14:25.787
What the hell do you think
you're doing up there?

14:25.822 --> 14:27.321
Tom, I'm here
with the chief.

14:27.356 --> 14:28.938
Get off the ladder.

14:28.973 --> 14:30.486
Tommy, listen to me!

14:30.521 --> 14:32.054
He doesn't even have
a harness on.

14:32.089 --> 14:34.087
He doesn't have
a safety clip on.

14:34.122 --> 14:36.320
He's just askin'
for charges, Lou.

14:36.355 --> 14:38.484
Battalion 1-5,
check Gavin's radio...

14:38.519 --> 14:40.751
- Help! Help me!
- Tell him to stay where he is.

14:40.786 --> 14:42.550
Make the grab, Tommy!

14:42.585 --> 14:44.151
She's gonna jump.
She's gonna jump.

14:44.186 --> 14:45.349
Just relax.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.483
Help me, please!

14:46.518 --> 14:48.483
Take it easy.
You're gonna be fine.

14:48.518 --> 14:50.283
Don't jump, okay?

14:51.550 --> 14:52.514
Jesus!

14:52.549 --> 14:54.215
Holy Christ. He got her.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.713
Son of a bitch.

14:55.748 --> 14:57.680
I'm gonna give him
a foot in the ass,

14:57.715 --> 14:58.645
you know that?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.279
If I can reach his ass.

15:00.314 --> 15:02.278
Don't look at me.
Face forward.

15:02.313 --> 15:04.213
That's it, yeah.
Use the rungs, okay?

15:04.248 --> 15:05.810
Anybody else
in your apartment?

15:05.845 --> 15:07.446
My mother and brother made it out

15:07.481 --> 15:09.045
before the walls came down.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.310
Okay. Good.

15:10.345 --> 15:11.510
Take it easy, now.

15:11.545 --> 15:12.676
- Hey, Franco!
- Yeah?

15:12.711 --> 15:13.943
You wanna pop this door?

15:13.978 --> 15:15.776
I'm gonna take Probie
up to the third floor.

15:15.811 --> 15:17.410
- All right, I got it.
- Come on, Probie.

15:17.445 --> 15:18.409
Right behind you.

15:18.444 --> 15:20.276
Come on, gimme
the Halligan.

15:20.311 --> 15:22.109
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Let's go!

15:22.144 --> 15:24.975
Jesus Christ.

15:25.010 --> 15:26.542
Sorry.

15:30.740 --> 15:33.206
All right, gimme it.
Gimme it. Gimme it.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.268
You stay here!

15:47.303 --> 15:49.570
I'm coming.
I'm coming in.

15:54.169 --> 15:56.968
I said, stay here!

16:03.400 --> 16:04.700
Engine 28...

16:05.966 --> 16:07.665
Hey, Probie,
there's spare cylinders

16:07.700 --> 16:08.931
in the back of the Suburban.

16:08.966 --> 16:11.015
Everything go
all right in there?

16:11.042 --> 16:13.534
She's worse than a goddamn probie.
She's dropping tools.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.849
She's out of breath.
She couldn't even pop a goddamn door,

16:15.897 --> 16:17.930
- for chrissakes.
- Welcome to the new F.D.N.Y.

16:17.965 --> 16:19.963
Hey, she, uh,
screwed the pooch, right?

16:21.563 --> 16:23.512
Yeah, I went with
the underdog for once.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.462
- Buy yourself somethin'.
- Thanks, chief.

16:26.596 --> 16:27.593
Shit.

16:27.628 --> 16:29.927
You pass the physical
test at the academy?

16:29.962 --> 16:31.126
Yeah, only my test

16:31.161 --> 16:32.960
didn't include
any illegal stunts.

16:32.995 --> 16:34.225
- Yeah.
- I heard what you did.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.926
That move went out
with steam engines

16:35.961 --> 16:37.091
and scaling ladders.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.526
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart.

16:38.561 --> 16:39.924
I didn't pass
the bar exam.

16:39.959 --> 16:41.791
I passed the physical test
at the fire academy

16:41.826 --> 16:43.408
with flying goddamn colors,
okay?

16:43.443 --> 16:44.991
So next time you wanna
talk to me

16:45.026 --> 16:46.155
about saving somebody,

16:46.187 --> 16:47.678
whether it's illegal
or legal means,

16:47.721 --> 16:50.398
you're gonna find yourself on your tight
little snare-drum ass. You follow?

16:59.753 --> 17:01.785
Hey, not for nothing, Probie,
but today,

17:01.820 --> 17:04.220
that broad made even you look
like you knew what you're doing.

17:05.220 --> 17:06.518
Yeah, what'd
I tell you guys?

17:06.553 --> 17:08.353
If I'd have got caught
in a real jam,

17:08.387 --> 17:10.152
- I'd have been on my own.
- Yup?

17:10.186 --> 17:11.782
Hey, foxy.

17:11.818 --> 17:13.148
Hey, what's up?

17:13.184 --> 17:15.817
Oh, just buying lingerie,
thinkin' of you.

17:15.852 --> 17:17.348
Oh, really?

17:17.384 --> 17:18.483
Wanna come over tonight?

17:18.519 --> 17:19.449
Sure.

17:19.483 --> 17:21.016
Uh, no. No, actually.

17:21.050 --> 17:23.450
What's going on with you?

17:23.484 --> 17:25.848
I'm, uh-- I'm at work.

17:25.884 --> 17:26.979
Hey, let's, uh,

17:27.013 --> 17:28.547
switch it up a little bit.

17:28.582 --> 17:30.048
Maybe go to a hotel
or something.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.279
Oh... which one, dream lover?

17:33.314 --> 17:35.913
You know the Gansevoort
over on 14th Street?

17:35.948 --> 17:38.130
It's the new joint?
That, like, hip place?

17:38.165 --> 17:40.313
Why don't you meet me there
around 8:30,

17:40.348 --> 17:41.444
all right?

17:41.479 --> 17:43.810
Just check yourself in,
go upstairs,

17:43.845 --> 17:46.411
order up some Dom Pérignon
and some caviar,

17:46.446 --> 17:47.710
the whole nine yards, all right?

17:48.743 --> 17:50.075
What should I wear?

17:50.110 --> 17:51.642
Well, you're in
a lingerie store, right?

17:51.677 --> 17:52.974
Yes.

17:53.009 --> 17:54.608
Bring four different outfits.

18:13.338 --> 18:14.338
Hello?

18:14.373 --> 18:15.303
Uh, hi.

18:15.338 --> 18:16.803
Is, uh, Jennifer there?

18:16.838 --> 18:17.768
Who's calling?

18:17.803 --> 18:19.768
This is Bobby Timolty

18:19.803 --> 18:22.436
from her, um,
her science class.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.268
It's a Bobby Timolty.

18:27.701 --> 18:29.150
It's a boy.

18:29.185 --> 18:30.600
Talk to him.

18:36.833 --> 18:37.931
Hello?

18:37.966 --> 18:39.165
Jennifer,
it's Colleen's dad.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.863
Don't hang up.
Don't say a word, okay?

18:40.907 --> 18:42.978
I know your mother hates
the fact that you're a lesbian,

18:42.996 --> 18:45.114
and I know how you feel
about the Murphy kid thing,

18:45.150 --> 18:47.959
but she was telling the truth.
She's not involved with that kid, okay?

18:47.998 --> 18:49.619
- She's totally in love with you.
- She--

18:49.668 --> 18:51.646
Don't say "she."
Say, "Oh, how you doing, Bobby?"

18:51.719 --> 18:53.925
So it sounds like you're talking
to Bobby Timolty, okay?

18:53.964 --> 18:55.728
- Oh, how you doing, Bobby?
- There you go. Okay.

18:55.763 --> 18:56.894
Your mom's got
a big smile

18:56.929 --> 18:58.528
- on her face right now, right?
- Yeah.

18:58.563 --> 19:00.228
Yeah, perfect.
Now, listen.

19:10.493 --> 19:11.959
How ya doin'?

19:11.994 --> 19:13.390
Fantastic.

19:13.425 --> 19:15.656
Look, I gotta ask.

19:15.691 --> 19:17.257
It's... You know the routine.

19:17.292 --> 19:18.523
I can do this job.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.289
I'm just under
a lot of pressure,

19:20.324 --> 19:22.021
and I've been taking shit
from everybody,

19:22.056 --> 19:24.955
and all eyes were on me,
and yeah, I shit the bed, chief.

19:24.990 --> 19:27.855
I did, but I can do this job.
I've done all of it before.

19:27.890 --> 19:31.021
Look, I could check around
about your reputation,

19:31.056 --> 19:32.620
but that might be
a bit more embarrassing

19:32.655 --> 19:34.420
than it already is.

19:34.455 --> 19:35.853
Hmm?

19:37.353 --> 19:40.017
After 9/11...

19:40.052 --> 19:46.085
there was this paralegal chick
that I worked with years ago.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.217
Now, she never
passed the physical.

19:48.252 --> 19:49.983
She took it three times,

19:50.018 --> 19:51.416
special physical,

19:51.451 --> 19:53.747
and they grandfathered her in

19:53.782 --> 19:56.550
because she sued the city
for sexual harassment.

19:56.585 --> 19:58.115
Now...

20:00.915 --> 20:03.246
She was talking to The Post,

20:03.281 --> 20:06.178
and she said
that when she read the list

20:06.213 --> 20:11.145
of the 343 heroes
that gave their life that day...

20:11.180 --> 20:12.745
she was disgusted.

20:12.780 --> 20:14.044
Hmm?

20:14.079 --> 20:16.076
Disgusted.

20:16.111 --> 20:18.877
Because none of the names
on that list were female.

20:22.576 --> 20:24.907
Believe that shit?

20:24.942 --> 20:27.409
I actually heard about that.

20:27.444 --> 20:28.839
She didn't think about

20:28.874 --> 20:31.390
the parents
who lost their children,

20:31.425 --> 20:34.049
the children
who lost their fathers,

20:34.084 --> 20:36.638
the women
who lost their husbands.

20:36.673 --> 20:39.739
All she was concerned about
were the girls.

20:39.774 --> 20:40.737
Herself

20:40.772 --> 20:42.238
and the girls.

20:42.273 --> 20:45.372
My point being this:

20:46.970 --> 20:49.471
the mayor,
the governor, the courts,

20:49.506 --> 20:51.601
Jesus Christ himself,

20:51.636 --> 20:54.903
can dictate that you have
the right to be here,

20:54.938 --> 20:56.234
but unless you can

20:56.269 --> 20:58.202
bring somethin'
to the table,

20:58.237 --> 21:00.135
with the guys in this firehouse,

21:00.170 --> 21:01.769
you ain't got a chance.

21:01.804 --> 21:03.518
You just think
about that,

21:03.553 --> 21:05.233
and you get back
to me, huh?

21:05.268 --> 21:06.298
Okay.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.765
Oh, and, uh, your bathroom,

21:08.800 --> 21:11.399
it'll be up and ready
in a couple days.

21:11.434 --> 21:13.563
Thank you.

21:13.598 --> 21:15.532
You're welcome.

21:22.330 --> 21:24.296
DA's office, Detective Gavin.

21:24.331 --> 21:25.294
Hey, it's me.

21:25.329 --> 21:26.294
Look, I got stopped

21:26.329 --> 21:27.329
by this cop
named Collins

21:27.364 --> 21:28.293
this morning,

21:28.328 --> 21:29.293
and I tried everything.

21:29.328 --> 21:31.395
I even told him
Mom had a heart attack,

21:31.430 --> 21:32.994
but nothing worked.

21:33.029 --> 21:34.426
Red Collins?

21:34.461 --> 21:36.625
Yeah. Can you, uh,
take care of it for me?

21:36.660 --> 21:39.293
Hey, didn't you beat his ass
in a hockey game last year?

21:39.328 --> 21:40.991
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

21:41.026 --> 21:43.290
Hey, look, didn't you
fix some problem

21:43.325 --> 21:44.925
a night manager
over at the Gansevoort Hotel

21:44.960 --> 21:46.089
was having
a couple weeks ago?

21:46.124 --> 21:47.724
Yeah, a little problem
with the rooftop club

21:47.759 --> 21:49.324
and a couple punks
in the bar. Why?

21:49.359 --> 21:50.823
So he owes you
a favor, right?

21:50.858 --> 21:52.290
A couple favors.

21:52.325 --> 21:53.723
Well, I need one.

21:54.890 --> 21:56.123
Tommy.

21:56.158 --> 21:57.321
Timo.

21:57.356 --> 21:59.954
Look, I need you to call him
and get me a room

21:59.989 --> 22:01.921
for the next three hours,
all right?

22:01.956 --> 22:03.854
Those are my favors,
Tommy. For me.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.019
Timo, it'd be terrible

22:05.054 --> 22:06.586
if that nightclub
inside that hotel

22:06.621 --> 22:07.685
got closed down tonight

22:07.720 --> 22:09.685
because of a violation
of fire safety rules,

22:09.720 --> 22:10.786
don't you think?

22:10.821 --> 22:11.852
You're a prick.

22:11.887 --> 22:12.984
Douchebag.

22:13.019 --> 22:14.851
Make sure
all the food and booze

22:14.886 --> 22:16.002
is comped too, okay?

22:16.037 --> 22:17.118
- No way, Tommy.
- Bye-bye.

22:17.153 --> 22:18.217
This is ridiculous.

22:18.252 --> 22:20.182
Tommy? Hello?

22:20.217 --> 22:23.050
It takes a bagpipe.

22:24.283 --> 22:26.183
I don't get it.

22:26.218 --> 22:27.180
Mm.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.165
You see, baby,
the octopus thought

22:29.200 --> 22:31.190
that the bagpipes
was another octopus,

22:31.225 --> 22:33.181
and he wanted
to have sex with him.

22:33.216 --> 22:34.480
Oh.

22:34.515 --> 22:35.714
Oh! That's funny! Funny.

22:35.749 --> 22:36.846
Yeah.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.379
Excuse us.

22:40.414 --> 22:42.079
- Oh, yeah.
- Hurry back...

22:42.114 --> 22:44.446
sweet, sexy thing.

22:47.577 --> 22:50.177
Goddamn, man, your twin
has a great ass.

22:50.212 --> 22:51.409
Yeah. God.
So does yours.

22:51.444 --> 22:54.642
Yeah, but yours is...
I mean, it's perfect.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.293
Did you see the eyes
on your twin?

22:56.328 --> 22:57.909
I mean, they're darker
than my twin.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.040
Yeah. Yeah.

22:59.075 --> 23:00.207
Yeah, that's hot.

23:00.242 --> 23:01.407
Plus, those lips.
Oh, God.

23:01.442 --> 23:04.840
Yeah, you know,
they're a little small.

23:04.875 --> 23:05.940
See, I like that.

23:05.975 --> 23:07.207
I like that.

23:09.906 --> 23:11.238
We gotta switch.

23:11.273 --> 23:13.506
- Yeah, you take Heather.
- You take Brittany.

23:13.541 --> 23:15.239
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Abso-goddamn-lutely.

23:15.274 --> 23:17.138
Um... how?

23:22.203 --> 23:23.168
Yeah?

23:23.203 --> 23:24.701
Yeah, it's me.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.336
Hey, Dad. What's goin' on?
How you doin'?

23:26.371 --> 23:28.102
Ah, good. Good.

23:28.137 --> 23:29.067
How's Ma?

23:29.102 --> 23:31.599
She went to the grocery store.

23:31.634 --> 23:35.533
She's making her famous
chicken casserole tonight.

23:35.568 --> 23:36.832
God help us.

23:36.867 --> 23:39.067
So what do you need?

23:39.102 --> 23:40.331
Well, I wanted

23:40.366 --> 23:42.699
some of them shooters
and a little mini-fridge,

23:42.734 --> 23:44.031
like Teddy had.

23:44.066 --> 23:46.232
Stick it in the basement.
Your mother will never know.

23:46.267 --> 23:47.663
Dad...

23:47.698 --> 23:49.297
- Tommy.
- All right, all right.

23:49.332 --> 23:50.931
I'll see what I can do.

23:50.966 --> 23:52.530
Oh, shit. Here she comes.

23:54.030 --> 23:55.594
Thanks, Tom.

23:55.629 --> 23:57.863
Jesus Christ almighty.

24:00.129 --> 24:01.862
Go high, bro.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.792
So, uh, first night.

24:06.827 --> 24:09.193
What do you wanna do?
You wanna, uh, wanna go out?

24:09.228 --> 24:10.691
You wanna stay in?

24:10.726 --> 24:12.559
Or, uh, whatever you wanna do.

24:12.594 --> 24:14.358
Um, you know, I had a long day.

24:14.405 --> 24:16.936
Plus, I've been sleeping at
the firehouse, and I get the rookie bed,

24:16.991 --> 24:18.541
which is like
sleeping on concrete.

24:18.576 --> 24:20.091
Dude, no problem.
We'll just stay in.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.575
Oh, you know what's on tonight?

24:21.610 --> 24:23.024
The Mickey Mantle documentary.

24:23.059 --> 24:24.774
Fox is rebroadcasting it.

24:24.809 --> 24:26.815
The one hour-long version?

24:26.850 --> 24:28.822
The hour-long version.

24:28.857 --> 24:30.322
You go high, bro.

24:31.621 --> 24:32.654
Now go low.

24:34.088 --> 24:36.987
Oh, and to top it off,
guess what I got?

24:37.022 --> 24:37.952
What?

24:37.987 --> 24:39.918
Jell-O shots.

24:39.953 --> 24:42.320
Jesus. You think of everything.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.403
A little lemon-lime.

24:44.438 --> 24:46.417
A little blue surge.

24:46.452 --> 24:48.351
You don't scare me.
Bring it on.

24:48.386 --> 24:49.550
Yeah, I thought so.

24:50.617 --> 24:51.650
Cheers, bro.

24:55.783 --> 24:57.414
Oh! Ho, ho.

25:51.105 --> 25:52.421
Oh!

25:57.669 --> 25:59.802
Oh!

26:00.901 --> 26:02.466
Mm, Heather,
sweetheart, excuse me.

26:02.501 --> 26:04.568
I gotta hit
the little boy's room, okay?

26:04.603 --> 26:06.002
Sean?

26:06.037 --> 26:07.552
Yeah.

26:07.587 --> 26:09.032
What?

26:09.067 --> 26:10.400
Oh, hey, you know what?

26:10.435 --> 26:11.733
We'll be right back.

26:23.997 --> 26:24.995
Uh.

26:25.030 --> 26:26.228
What are you doin'?

26:26.263 --> 26:27.496
What, you're not
gonna piss?

26:27.531 --> 26:28.760
No. Now, look.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.178
Okay, this is what
I'm thinkin'.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.527
We get the check
here, right?

26:31.562 --> 26:33.926
We go to another place.
When we get to the other place,

26:33.961 --> 26:36.961
you make sure you sit on the same
side of the table as Heather does,

26:36.996 --> 26:38.392
and I'll do the same
with Brittany.

26:38.427 --> 26:40.427
- You think they'll get the hint?
- How couldn't they?

26:40.462 --> 26:41.591
What if they get pissed off?

26:41.626 --> 26:44.059
Well, then we'll just
have to, you know,

26:44.094 --> 26:45.126
pretend like
we got confused

26:45.161 --> 26:46.257
and try to have sex

26:46.292 --> 26:47.758
with our original
assignments,

26:47.793 --> 26:48.723
although I don't know

26:48.758 --> 26:50.158
how I'm gonna
get around that mole

26:50.193 --> 26:51.122
on Heather's right tit.

26:51.157 --> 26:52.323
See, again,
I think that's hot.

26:52.358 --> 26:53.957
That's like a tribute
to Cindy Crawford.

26:53.992 --> 26:56.256
Ugh. Come on.

26:56.291 --> 26:57.390
What?

26:57.425 --> 26:58.454
What?

26:58.489 --> 27:00.222
What? I really
gotta go now.

27:00.257 --> 27:02.856
Hey. Hey!

27:02.891 --> 27:05.420
Shit.

27:05.455 --> 27:07.054
--In the
Yankees' right field,

27:07.089 --> 27:08.154
Mickey Mantle...

27:08.189 --> 27:09.419
Goddamn.

27:09.454 --> 27:11.553
What a specimen
he was, huh?

27:11.588 --> 27:12.953
...Joe DiMaggio...

27:12.988 --> 27:14.284
Look at his forearms.

27:14.319 --> 27:15.952
They're the size
of my legs, bro.

27:15.987 --> 27:17.069
Yeah.

27:17.104 --> 27:18.116
Whew.

27:18.151 --> 27:19.568
I mean, he's just
incredible.

27:19.603 --> 27:20.950
I mean, the guy
was a rock.

27:20.985 --> 27:22.701
It was like he was
made out of granite.

27:22.736 --> 27:24.417
And 97 RBIs over
the next eight seasons.

27:25.717 --> 27:27.849
Whoa! That's power, dude.
That is pure power.

27:27.884 --> 27:29.549
Oh, no, thanks.
Department policy.

27:29.584 --> 27:31.614
Oh, right.
Sorry, dude.

27:31.649 --> 27:33.048
Sorry about that.
You mind if I--

27:33.083 --> 27:34.282
No, no. Knock yourself out.

27:34.317 --> 27:35.280
Cool.

27:35.315 --> 27:38.814
Holy shit, did you
see that catch?

27:38.849 --> 27:40.747
Mm...

27:45.113 --> 27:46.777
So...

27:46.812 --> 27:48.077
I was talking

27:48.112 --> 27:49.611
to my friend, Lisa,
last night.

27:49.646 --> 27:51.111
You know,
my psychic friend?

27:51.146 --> 27:52.143
Mm-hmm.

27:52.178 --> 27:55.444
And she said that
when she first met you

27:55.479 --> 27:56.409
in the supermarket,

27:56.444 --> 27:57.743
when she touched
your hand...

27:57.778 --> 27:59.675
Mm-hmm?

28:01.109 --> 28:03.841
She thinks that...

28:03.876 --> 28:06.539
you're a ghost magnet.

28:06.574 --> 28:09.974
I-- I'm a--
I'm a "ghost magnet"?

28:10.005 --> 28:10.511
Yeah.

28:10.550 --> 28:12.208
Look, she's really,
really empowered.

28:12.275 --> 28:13.204
Oh, Sheila...

28:13.239 --> 28:14.371
She really is, honey.

28:14.406 --> 28:15.938
And she's almost
never wrong,

28:15.973 --> 28:18.571
and she said that
she got this vibe from you.

28:18.606 --> 28:20.171
She got a vibe from me?

28:20.206 --> 28:21.702
I don't have a vibe, okay?

28:21.737 --> 28:23.404
I can't afford a vibe.
Jesus Christ.

28:23.439 --> 28:24.537
Hey, take it easy.

28:24.572 --> 28:25.835
"A vibe."

28:25.870 --> 28:27.101
Look, she said

28:27.136 --> 28:29.434
that you're an open vessel.

28:29.469 --> 28:31.768
I'm a vessel.
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

28:31.803 --> 28:33.600
Yeah. I'm a boat.

28:33.635 --> 28:35.968
I'm a goddamn boat
full of ghosts.

28:36.003 --> 28:37.099
Yeah.

28:37.134 --> 28:40.299
She said that you're prone
to visits--

28:40.334 --> 28:43.533
Uh, visitations, I think,
is what she said.

28:47.333 --> 28:49.198
Have you seen Jimmy?

28:50.664 --> 28:53.097
No. He's dead.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.530
Don't lie to me.

29:09.294 --> 29:11.227
Okay.

29:26.556 --> 29:30.121
I have not seen Jimmy.

29:30.156 --> 29:32.423
You know how important
it would be to me

29:32.458 --> 29:34.156
if I could,

29:34.191 --> 29:35.953
okay?

29:35.988 --> 29:39.486
And I'm not a ghost magnet
or a boat or--

29:39.521 --> 29:41.152
Vessel.

29:41.187 --> 29:43.154
Whatever. All right?

29:43.189 --> 29:44.786
I'm me.

29:45.986 --> 29:47.552
Okay?

29:48.751 --> 29:50.384
Okay.

29:50.419 --> 29:52.285
All right.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.715
Okay.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.583
Let's get our stuff
and get out of here.

30:02.548 --> 30:03.731
His final four years

30:03.766 --> 30:04.880
with the Yankees

30:04.915 --> 30:06.364
were far from his finest.

30:06.399 --> 30:07.779
Injuries and drinking

30:07.814 --> 30:09.913
affected his performance
considerably

30:09.948 --> 30:13.513
and ultimately dropped
his lifetime batting average

30:13.548 --> 30:14.746
to 298.

30:18.879 --> 30:20.811
Have a seat.

30:23.111 --> 30:25.042
Excuse me.

30:25.077 --> 30:27.242
All right. Oh...

30:27.277 --> 30:29.410
Another round of Cosmos
for everybody?

30:29.445 --> 30:30.574
Thank you, please.

30:30.609 --> 30:33.908
We'll take four Cosmos,
two with cherry, please.

30:33.943 --> 30:35.692
So this place is nice.

30:35.727 --> 30:38.000
Yeah, it's new.

30:38.035 --> 30:40.274
- So.
- So, uh--

30:40.309 --> 30:42.072
What?

30:42.107 --> 30:44.006
Look, guys, what is it?

30:46.539 --> 30:48.455
Spit it out, guys.

30:48.490 --> 30:50.337
You tell them, Franco.

30:50.372 --> 30:52.238
We switched
the seating arrangements

30:52.273 --> 30:53.671
for a reason.

30:55.038 --> 30:56.236
Really?

30:56.271 --> 30:58.068
Yeah, look,
no offense, Brittany.

30:58.103 --> 30:59.902
I think you're really,
really, really cute.

30:59.937 --> 31:03.169
It's just that I got this thing
for, like, not tiny,

31:03.204 --> 31:06.303
but smaller than your sister's--
Uh, than, your lips.

31:06.338 --> 31:09.402
And she's got this mole
that's been driving me crazy.

31:09.437 --> 31:12.566
And I just fell in love
with your ass, Brittany.

31:12.601 --> 31:14.333
I mean, it is, um...

31:14.368 --> 31:16.031
It's-- I'm sorry.

31:16.066 --> 31:17.249
No offense
to you, Heather.

31:17.284 --> 31:18.432
I mean,
your ass is great,

31:18.467 --> 31:19.496
but your sister's is,

31:19.531 --> 31:22.399
uh, well,
it's right up my alley.

31:23.697 --> 31:24.997
I'm Brittany.

31:25.032 --> 31:26.395
What?

31:26.430 --> 31:28.629
She's Brittany. I'm Heather.

31:29.896 --> 31:32.262
Check out my mole.

31:32.297 --> 31:34.628
Check out my mole.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.661
Oh.

31:39.894 --> 31:41.361
Check out our asses.

31:43.227 --> 31:45.559
You blew it, boys.

31:45.594 --> 31:47.857
And that's too bad,

31:47.892 --> 31:49.825
'cause I was gonna
bang your brains out.

31:54.991 --> 31:57.823
And here's your drinks.

31:59.423 --> 32:01.221
Just can't
keep that up.

32:01.256 --> 32:04.622
I mean, no one
runs out of money forever.

32:04.657 --> 32:07.805
It's just, you double down,
you come back.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.954
It's just not gonna
work out, you know.

32:10.989 --> 32:13.121
How can you expect
anyone to--

32:13.156 --> 32:14.451
Hey!

32:14.486 --> 32:16.051
Oh, hey, Tom.

32:16.086 --> 32:17.619
I was just talking about you.

32:17.654 --> 32:19.470
To who?

32:19.505 --> 32:21.251
Uh, myself.

32:21.286 --> 32:23.449
What's going on?

32:23.484 --> 32:26.317
Aw, T, I got nowhere to--

32:26.352 --> 32:29.150
I got no--
I lost the house.

32:29.185 --> 32:30.448
How?

32:30.483 --> 32:31.732
Atlantic City.

32:31.767 --> 32:32.924
Jesus, Teddy.

32:32.959 --> 32:34.047
Yeah, I know.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.447
I was on a roll
and everything.

32:35.482 --> 32:37.315
Next thing you know,
I got no house.

32:37.350 --> 32:38.280
I called your Aunt Peg.

32:38.315 --> 32:39.481
You're not gonna believe this.

32:39.516 --> 32:40.546
She met somebody.

32:40.581 --> 32:41.980
- Really?
- Another broad.

32:42.015 --> 32:43.047
She's a lesbian?

32:43.082 --> 32:44.380
A dyke!

32:44.415 --> 32:45.644
Man.

32:45.679 --> 32:47.913
I got no place to go.

32:47.948 --> 32:49.811
Can I stay?

32:49.846 --> 32:51.110
Well, the thing is,

32:51.145 --> 32:53.978
I usually sleep on the couch
down here.

32:54.013 --> 32:55.228
I, you know, I watch--

32:55.263 --> 32:56.408
Aw, come on, I'm fat.

32:56.443 --> 32:57.609
I'm gonna hit 400 long before

32:57.644 --> 32:59.793
anyone in Major League Baseball
does again.

32:59.828 --> 33:01.943
Please don't make me
climb those stairs.

33:01.978 --> 33:04.373
All right. All right.

33:04.408 --> 33:05.508
Hey, what's
with the money?

33:05.543 --> 33:07.174
It's all I got left.

33:07.209 --> 33:09.572
I knew Peg was gonna screw me
one day,

33:09.607 --> 33:14.007
so I managed to put
some cash aside. Six grand.

33:14.042 --> 33:15.539
Six grand?

33:15.574 --> 33:16.856
Wow.

33:16.891 --> 33:18.104
Yeah.

33:18.139 --> 33:20.255
If anything happens to me,
I want you to take half

33:20.290 --> 33:22.372
and give it to your cousin,
Mick, for his church,

33:22.407 --> 33:24.537
and the other half to your kids.

33:24.572 --> 33:26.121
What about your kids?

33:26.156 --> 33:27.635
My kids are assholes.

33:27.670 --> 33:29.371
Should I take this for you--?

33:29.406 --> 33:30.336
Ah, no.

33:30.371 --> 33:33.336
This bag stays right here
with me.

33:33.371 --> 33:34.535
Okay, I'll turn the AC up.

33:34.570 --> 33:36.369
- Thanks, kid.
- Okay.

33:36.404 --> 33:37.935
Hey, Tommy.

33:37.970 --> 33:39.366
Yeah?

33:39.401 --> 33:41.334
I love you.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.266
I love you too.

33:44.301 --> 33:46.300
I'll see you
in the morning, all right?

33:46.335 --> 33:47.733
Okay.

33:48.900 --> 33:51.365
All right, bro.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.265
Su casa es mi casa.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.131
You need something?

33:55.166 --> 33:56.331
Yep.

33:56.366 --> 33:57.462
What?

33:57.497 --> 33:58.796
"Su casa."

33:58.831 --> 33:59.828
Huh?

33:59.863 --> 34:01.229
I get it.

34:01.264 --> 34:04.395
All right. Good night, bro.
The Mick!

34:04.430 --> 34:05.896
Mickey Mantle!

34:05.931 --> 34:07.563
The Mick!

34:07.598 --> 34:09.195
Good night.

34:15.159 --> 34:16.759
All right.
All right.

34:16.793 --> 34:17.791
Holy shit, bro!

34:17.826 --> 34:19.626
I know.
This isn't what it seems, okay?

34:19.661 --> 34:21.190
Hey!

34:21.225 --> 34:22.359
Dude, I'm not gay.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.023
I'm not gay.

34:24.058 --> 34:25.724
Listen.
Honestly, I'm not.

34:25.759 --> 34:26.688
Hey!

34:26.724 --> 34:27.722
Look, look,
look, look.

34:27.757 --> 34:29.822
You're the first guy
I ever--

34:29.866 --> 34:31.587
- I ever had a hard-on for.
- Hey!

34:31.610 --> 34:33.280
Like, literally ever
had a hard-on for.

34:33.324 --> 34:34.288
Hey, stop, man!

34:34.322 --> 34:35.989
Easy, Mikey.
Easy, Mikey.

34:36.024 --> 34:37.353
Just easy. Come on.

34:37.388 --> 34:38.588
I just wanna
thank you.

34:38.623 --> 34:39.552
Please, just cut--

34:39.587 --> 34:40.786
I just wanna
thank you!

34:40.822 --> 34:42.721
Mikey! Hey, Mikey!

34:42.755 --> 34:43.851
Now, listen.

34:43.887 --> 34:45.219
Let me
tell you something.

34:45.255 --> 34:46.686
Ah!

34:48.385 --> 34:50.784
Just pretend
I'm the Mick, Mike.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.384
All right,
just pretend.

34:53.418 --> 34:54.435
Stop it, man!

34:54.469 --> 34:55.451
You're sick!

34:56.751 --> 34:57.715
Dude.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.617
You got nothing.

35:09.048 --> 35:11.147
Now...

35:12.647 --> 35:14.545
I'm gonna be Mickey Mantle,

35:14.580 --> 35:17.479
and you can be whoever the hell
you wanna be.

35:17.514 --> 35:20.013
You can be Nomar,

35:20.048 --> 35:22.077
Cam Neely,

35:22.112 --> 35:25.245
or you can be
Bobby-goddamn-Orr.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.509
I tell you what:

35:26.544 --> 35:28.345
I'll make it easy on you, bro.

35:28.380 --> 35:29.977
I'll play the broad.

35:30.012 --> 35:31.142
All right?

35:31.177 --> 35:33.576
I'll take it in the ass,
and you can be the guy.

35:33.611 --> 35:36.609
Okay? So you
can have some fun.

35:36.644 --> 35:37.609
Oh!

35:50.073 --> 35:52.605
A Mickey Mantle model.

35:52.640 --> 35:53.638
That's funny.

36:15.633 --> 36:19.067
Goodbye, cruel world.

36:24.098 --> 36:28.098
Tell my wife
she can kiss my ass.

37:00.690 --> 37:02.555
Yeah?

37:02.590 --> 37:04.690
So how you doing
on the money front?

37:04.725 --> 37:05.757
Jesus Christ, Janet.

37:05.792 --> 37:06.789
Look, you're never home.

37:06.824 --> 37:07.754
I saw your truck.

37:07.789 --> 37:09.205
I saw you
moving around upstairs.

37:09.240 --> 37:10.621
- Look--
- I need the money, Tom.

37:13.121 --> 37:15.520
Look, if you can't get it,
then you gotta tell me.

37:15.555 --> 37:16.618
I talked to Lou.

37:16.653 --> 37:18.219
I called this Keough guy.

37:18.254 --> 37:19.570
Nobody's got anything,
all right?

37:19.605 --> 37:21.145
Probably have to wait
till next week

37:21.180 --> 37:22.651
when I get my next check
from the city.

37:22.686 --> 37:24.585
- Yeah, great.
- Jesus, how fast do you need it?

37:24.620 --> 37:26.218
The bank is on my ass, Tommy.

37:26.253 --> 37:27.817
Well, I didn't know that, okay?

37:27.852 --> 37:29.082
Good thing I didn't die.

37:29.117 --> 37:31.318
Well, actually, that depends
on how you look at it.

37:31.353 --> 37:32.651
Look, I'm just sayin'--

37:32.686 --> 37:33.915
'Cause if you had died,

37:33.950 --> 37:35.299
between your truck,
the house,

37:35.334 --> 37:36.613
and the tiny
little insurance plan

37:36.648 --> 37:38.915
that you were able to get
because of your occupation,

37:38.950 --> 37:40.932
I'd say I'd have
about 150 grand

37:40.967 --> 37:42.914
in my hands
within two weeks.

37:48.847 --> 37:50.246
Hey, Teddy!

37:52.812 --> 37:54.594
Oh, God!

37:54.629 --> 37:56.342
Jesus.

37:56.377 --> 37:57.627
Teddy! Hey!

37:57.662 --> 37:58.843
Jesus Christ!

37:58.878 --> 38:00.244
Jesus, what are you doin' here?

38:00.279 --> 38:01.394
What do you mean?

38:01.429 --> 38:02.510
Where's Elvis?

38:02.545 --> 38:03.708
What?

38:03.743 --> 38:05.943
- Isn't this heaven?
- No, it's my garage.

38:05.978 --> 38:07.908
Goddamn it! I'm alive! Shit!

38:07.943 --> 38:11.575
I only had an eighth of a tank.
I thought I could make it. Shit!

38:11.610 --> 38:12.808
Come on.

38:16.473 --> 38:19.538
Screw it.

38:19.573 --> 38:20.673
This is a sign, T.

38:20.708 --> 38:21.740
A sign of what?

38:21.775 --> 38:22.737
My luck's changin'.

38:22.772 --> 38:24.005
God wants me to have fun.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.072
Where you goin'?

38:25.107 --> 38:26.070
To the track.

38:26.105 --> 38:28.138
What were you gonna do
with all that money?

38:28.173 --> 38:30.705
I was takin' it with me.

38:30.740 --> 38:33.202
Hey, Tommy, do me a favor.

38:33.237 --> 38:35.603
Pick up that cash
for me, will you?

38:35.638 --> 38:37.333
That's it.

38:37.368 --> 38:39.600
You're going on a diet.

38:39.634 --> 38:41.594
- You're not gonna believe this one.
- Try me.

38:41.655 --> 38:43.922
The one on the bottom's
a 17-year-old from Brooklyn.

38:43.970 --> 38:45.967
Ran away from home
a couple of days ago.

38:46.002 --> 38:47.850
Reported missing
by his mother.

38:47.885 --> 38:50.158
Last seen with
the one on the top,

38:50.193 --> 38:52.432
who's his boyfriend-
slash-girlfriend.

38:52.467 --> 38:53.697
Got a fake pair of tits

38:53.732 --> 38:55.665
and savin' up
to buy a vagina.

38:55.700 --> 38:56.897
Yeah, who isn't?

38:56.932 --> 38:59.214
They been up there
for about an hour,

38:59.249 --> 39:01.497
- gropin' and blowin' each other.
- Oh, man.

39:01.532 --> 39:02.931
Yeah, pretty disgusting.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.728
Come down!

39:04.763 --> 39:06.596
You come on up here.

39:06.631 --> 39:08.027
Whoo!

39:08.062 --> 39:09.995
That's right.
We just wanna be together.

39:10.030 --> 39:11.929
Traumatized a couple
of skateboarders.

39:11.964 --> 39:13.425
Problem is, when the cop

39:13.460 --> 39:14.826
gets brave enough
to go up there,

39:14.923 --> 39:17.516
the two lovebirds keep on
climbing higher and higher.

39:17.607 --> 39:18.963
Two fags in a tree.

39:19.046 --> 39:20.946
It's a treesome.

39:21.325 --> 39:22.524
Who's goin' up?

39:22.559 --> 39:24.159
The one in the thong's
afraid of heights,

39:24.194 --> 39:26.923
so, you know,
he, she, it's...

39:26.958 --> 39:29.125
gonna be a real hugger
on the way back down.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.708
Who's goin' up?

39:30.743 --> 39:32.222
Probie.

39:32.257 --> 39:33.590
Get your ass up there.

39:33.625 --> 39:34.623
Please, guys, no.

39:34.658 --> 39:36.056
I'll go.

39:37.622 --> 39:39.788
We have a right to be here.

39:41.988 --> 39:43.588
We're staying
till the end of time, right?

39:43.623 --> 39:46.019
Go.

39:46.054 --> 39:48.054
Stay back here, people.

39:56.085 --> 39:58.584
I got a double sawbuck says
she don't bring 'em down,

39:58.619 --> 39:59.952
all the way down,
on the ground.

39:59.987 --> 40:01.250
Oh, I'm in.

40:01.285 --> 40:02.683
There's no way
she can do that.

40:02.718 --> 40:03.715
In.

40:03.750 --> 40:04.915
Good news, kid.

40:04.950 --> 40:06.550
I turned that three grand
into 12 large.

40:06.585 --> 40:08.447
Holy shit.

40:08.482 --> 40:11.248
You know the three grand
I had for your kids?

40:11.283 --> 40:12.247
I still got it.

40:12.282 --> 40:15.182
If you want,
I can play it for you.

40:15.217 --> 40:16.979
Uh...

40:17.014 --> 40:17.979
Let me think.

40:18.014 --> 40:20.045
I don't know, Lou.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.844
I'd like nothin' better
to see her screw up

40:21.879 --> 40:24.146
so we can get her
the hell out of this firehouse,

40:24.181 --> 40:26.045
but I'm going with my gut.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.276
All right. Whatever.

40:28.311 --> 40:29.510
Tommy, you still with me?

40:29.545 --> 40:30.710
Make the call now, kid.

40:30.745 --> 40:31.675
Window's closing.

40:31.710 --> 40:33.410
All right, you know what?
Let it ride.

40:33.445 --> 40:35.142
Good boy.

40:35.177 --> 40:37.110
I'm not gonna go down
losing, guys.

40:37.145 --> 40:38.527
We just wanna be
left alone.

40:38.562 --> 40:39.909
Get ready to pay up, chief.

40:41.375 --> 40:43.672
I guess I'll
come down.

40:43.707 --> 40:45.175
Why don't you
come down first.

40:52.572 --> 40:54.405
Remember the bet.
The bet is on the ground.

40:58.159 --> 40:59.998
Hey, what are those,
pain pills?

41:00.057 --> 41:02.064
- Superman pills.
- You better watch that shit, Gav.

41:02.139 --> 41:03.537
It can lead
to errors of judgment.

41:03.572 --> 41:05.801
Yeah?

41:05.836 --> 41:06.769
Yeah, really.

41:08.969 --> 41:11.468
Come on down, come on.

41:11.503 --> 41:12.468
Take your time.

41:14.635 --> 41:16.834
Be what you wanna be!

41:18.700 --> 41:20.531
Okay, thank you.

41:20.566 --> 41:22.533
Up against the wall.
Hands behind your back.

41:24.465 --> 41:25.965
She pulled it off, Lou.

41:27.598 --> 41:28.562
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:28.597 --> 41:29.996
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

41:30.031 --> 41:32.063
What'd you say
to them up there?

41:32.098 --> 41:33.962
I said,
"Look, I already have a vagina,

41:33.997 --> 41:36.396
and I know one of you two
is looking to get one,

41:36.431 --> 41:37.963
so why don't we
come down on the ground

41:37.998 --> 41:39.495
and talk about this
like girlfriends?"

41:39.530 --> 41:41.495
And I promised
to get 'em a drink

41:41.530 --> 41:43.461
and make sure
nobody pressed charges.

41:43.496 --> 41:45.426
Why would they buy that?

41:45.461 --> 41:47.560
Because two of us
already have tits.

41:47.595 --> 41:48.825
So, did I prove that

41:48.860 --> 41:51.425
- I can bring something to this team?
- Yeah.

41:51.460 --> 41:52.724
Two fags up a tree.

41:52.759 --> 41:54.525
- We get that six times a week.
- Kiss my ass.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.291
You'd love that,
wouldn't you, sweetheart?

41:56.326 --> 41:57.591
Why don't you just--?

41:57.626 --> 41:58.790
Hey, hey, hey.

41:58.825 --> 42:00.524
Don't get
your Irish up, huh?

42:00.559 --> 42:01.756
I did these guys a favor.

42:01.791 --> 42:03.991
Nobody wanted to go up there,
and I did it well,

42:04.026 --> 42:05.122
and I still catch shit?

42:05.157 --> 42:07.822
Hey, this is no
sprint, sweetheart, huh?

42:07.857 --> 42:10.488
You won the battle.
The war still goes on.

42:10.523 --> 42:11.889
You tuck this one
under your belt

42:11.924 --> 42:13.022
and you move on.

42:14.687 --> 42:16.188
Tommy Gavin is dangerous, chief.

42:16.223 --> 42:18.387
Stay away from Tommy Gavin.

42:18.422 --> 42:19.820
He's crazy.

42:21.319 --> 42:23.219
The whole New York City
Fire Department is crazy.

42:23.254 --> 42:25.219
And there's crazy-good
and crazy-bad.

42:25.254 --> 42:26.652
Right now,
Gavin is crazy-good.

42:34.318 --> 42:35.281
Yeah?

42:35.316 --> 42:38.216
Hey, kid, we hit it big.

42:41.250 --> 42:42.848
Aah!

42:45.615 --> 42:47.714
So you are drinking again.

42:47.749 --> 42:48.647
Yep.

42:51.980 --> 42:53.678
Hmm.

42:53.713 --> 42:56.879
There's been a lot of talk
about you seeing Sheila.

42:56.914 --> 42:58.979
A lot.

42:59.014 --> 43:01.044
Mm-hm.

43:05.543 --> 43:08.575
Okay. Uh, Colleen has hooked
back up with Jennifer.

43:08.610 --> 43:09.941
Okay, so I sent them over--

43:09.976 --> 43:11.575
Yeah, you sent them over
to my house.

43:11.610 --> 43:12.542
I know. They're fine.

43:15.641 --> 43:16.840
You know, Tom,

43:16.875 --> 43:18.573
I really, really disapprove
of the situation,

43:18.608 --> 43:19.939
and I would
greatly appreciate it

43:19.974 --> 43:21.974
if you would help me
to get control of it.

43:22.009 --> 43:26.106
Mm. That's good.

43:29.838 --> 43:32.504
Obviously,
it is just a phase that--

43:39.369 --> 43:41.035
Did you call Roger?

43:47.601 --> 43:49.565
Ahh.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.200
Did you hear what I said?

43:51.235 --> 43:52.665
Yeah.

43:52.700 --> 43:54.766
And, yes, I did call him.

43:54.801 --> 43:56.230
And?

43:56.265 --> 43:58.430
And he's traveling right now.

43:58.465 --> 43:59.848
I think he's going
to Philadelphia.

43:59.883 --> 44:01.232
And I was expecting
him to call

44:01.267 --> 44:03.463
just when
you barged in.

44:21.793 --> 44:25.493
I think you asked me for what,
about, uh, four grand?

44:27.226 --> 44:30.491
I think there's
about six or seven here.

44:32.390 --> 44:33.591
Where did you get it, Tom?

44:33.626 --> 44:37.221
The harder I work...

44:37.256 --> 44:38.890
the luckier I goddamn get.

44:42.279 --> 44:45.279
