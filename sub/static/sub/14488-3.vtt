for instead of
infecting computers,

12:16.778 --> 12:20.239
it infects
the human brain.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.824
I like it.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.910
The million followers
will become an army
of zombies

12:24.994 --> 12:28.580
eager to obey
my every command!
(LAUGHING)

12:29.165 --> 12:31.417
The important thing is,
we're a family.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.584
No, it's not!

12:37.841 --> 12:39.299
(MR. CHUNKS SNEEZES)

12:39.634 --> 12:42.428
Ew! He sneezed in it.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.263
Oh, God,
I'm going to lose the bet.

12:44.347 --> 12:47.266
I'm gonna have to swim
in the juice of the
Puke-Me-Poop-You.

12:47.350 --> 12:50.477
Don't give up.
You just need more
titillating twits.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.438
Trust me,
I want twits that tittle.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.648
Then you're
gonna have to sink
to Bender's level.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.567
Stop acting like
the Queen of England.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.652
(WOMAN SINGING)

12:59.487 --> 13:01.196
Who's that?
The Queen of England?

13:02.031 --> 13:05.451
Excuse me.
I have to... Someplace.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.662
That was odd.
Where'd that
singing come from?

13:08.746 --> 13:12.124
It wasn't the goat.
All of its orifices
are in use.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.633
WOMAN: (SINGING) I dreamed
a dream in time gone by

13:21.843 --> 13:26.847
When hope was high
and life worth living

13:26.931 --> 13:30.976
I dreamed that
love would never die

13:31.060 --> 13:35.147
I dreamed that God
would be forgiving

13:35.231 --> 13:36.440
(SCREAMING)

13:36.900 --> 13:38.817
What the hell is that?
Nothing.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.110
I'm not nothing.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.071
All my life,
everyone's called me nothing.

13:43.281 --> 13:46.158
You have a boil on your butt
that sings show tunes
with you?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.368
Don't look at me.
I'm a freak.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.120
No, no, well...

13:51.164 --> 13:53.916
I've been ashamed of Susan
as long as I can remember.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.168
You named your boil Susan?

13:56.252 --> 14:00.422
A boil kinna have a name?
They also said
a boil kinna sing, but...

14:00.632 --> 14:06.220
(SINGING) Amazing grace
How...

14:06.304 --> 14:07.554
(SCREAMS)

14:10.600 --> 14:12.184
Ew! She's Scottish.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.938
I lance her every few months,
but she always grows back.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.147
(WEEPING)

14:17.232 --> 14:19.483
It's hard enough
being a Cyclops,

14:19.567 --> 14:23.403
but if anyone
found out about Susan,
I'd be devastated.

14:23.488 --> 14:29.117
(SINGING) Amazing grace
How...

14:29.953 --> 14:33.288
Whoa! Gross.
Million-follower gross.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.582
Fry, delete that.
Delete that right now!

14:35.667 --> 14:38.377
What? Oh. Okay.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.385
(CHUCKLING) So much for
a pleasant swim in vomit.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.432
(COUGHING)

14:52.976 --> 14:53.976
(WHISPERS) Send.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.394
(COUGHING)

14:55.478 --> 14:56.478
Did you delete it?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.563
Uh...

14:57.647 --> 15:00.148
Thanks, Fry,
you're a good friend.

15:04.237 --> 15:09.825
(SINGING) Amazing grace
How...

15:10.618 --> 15:12.035
(BOTH LAUGHING)

15:13.496 --> 15:16.373
Hey, there she goes
in the genuine.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.708
Let's get to hooting.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.001
(HOOTS)

15:19.085 --> 15:21.003
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:21.379 --> 15:24.590
If it ain'ts
the world's number ones
Internet sensation.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.634
Where? Also, what?

15:27.844 --> 15:33.432
(SINGING) Amazing grace...
How...

15:33.850 --> 15:35.517
(ALL LAUGHING)

15:37.186 --> 15:39.730
Play it one more time.
No!

15:39.814 --> 15:44.359
It's humiliating
and degrading to Leela.
Play it 10 more times.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.279
(SIGHS) I know I shouldn't
have twitted that,

15:47.363 --> 15:49.740
but not swimming in barf
might ease my conscience.

15:49.824 --> 15:53.785
But if Leela should find out,
her dignity sac will rupture.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.579
That's why we can't
let her see this.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.165
Leela, lock the door
so Leela doesn't...

15:58.249 --> 16:01.001
How could you do this?
(SOBBING)

16:11.971 --> 16:12.971
(INAUDIBLE)

16:38.998 --> 16:42.334
Poor Mr. Chunks.
At least he died
doing what he loved.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.421
He's in a better place now.

16:48.591 --> 16:52.469
There,
I turned a regular board
into a diving board.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.597
Impending news, everyone.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.266
We're about to learn
the winner of the bet.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.268
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.145
(WHISPERS)
I hope it's me.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.529
Wait a minute.
There's a chance
I could lose?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.280
That wasn't
part of the deal.

17:14.617 --> 17:18.328
Sweet Georgia Brown
of Kingston Town.
It's a tie.

17:18.413 --> 17:21.205
Since no one lost,
no one has to jump.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.666
All right, a tie!
I win again!

17:24.877 --> 17:26.627
I'm a scuzzball.

17:26.753 --> 17:29.923
Don't feel bad.
At least you're not Leela.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.052
A tie?

17:34.137 --> 17:36.346
This worked out better
than I could have hoped.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.724
Now I'll have two
million zombies.

17:38.808 --> 17:42.602
Actually, Fry and Bender
may share some of
the same followers.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.229
All we can say
for sure is that

17:44.313 --> 17:47.315
there will be
between one million
and two million zombies.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.151
All I can say
for sure is...

17:50.069 --> 17:53.822
Now, stop getting slapped
and power up the twit-worm!

17:56.492 --> 17:58.285
(POWER SURGING)

18:02.832 --> 18:04.750
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:06.169 --> 18:11.423
It's both
disgusting and inspiring,
like Jared from Subway.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.967
Okay, I'm a freak
with a singing butt boil,

18:14.093 --> 18:16.553
but I'm still a human being,
more or less.

18:16.637 --> 18:20.140
Singing butts boil?
That's yesterdays's news.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.769
Like that giant caterpillar
what ate Jared from Subway.

18:23.853 --> 18:27.898
Nows us Internet geeks
gots a whole new
video sensation.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.066
So, my humiliation
is over?

18:30.151 --> 18:31.526
Who are you?

18:36.324 --> 18:39.409
And now, to create
an unstoppable army

18:39.494 --> 18:42.245
of between one and two
million zombies!

18:44.332 --> 18:46.750
Shouldn't you
wait for the weather
to clear up?

18:46.834 --> 18:50.712
No. I give you
the twit-worm!

18:53.216 --> 18:54.382
Send.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.769
I'm sick of my head
doing things.

19:05.853 --> 19:06.853
Leela!

19:06.938 --> 19:08.855
Fry,
I came to talk to you.

19:08.940 --> 19:11.066
No,
I came to talk to you.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.027
It looked like you
were just sitting there,
but whatever.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.988
I am so, so sorry
for what I did,

19:17.073 --> 19:18.824
and I know I can never
make it up to you.

19:18.908 --> 19:22.661
You don't have to apologize.
In fact, I came to thank you.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.496
I think you mean hit me.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.499
Everyone knows my secret,
but no one cares.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.709
I have nothing
to hide anymore.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.004
Fry, thanks to
your selfish rudeness,

19:33.089 --> 19:36.299
a terrible weight has been
lifted from my heart.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.219
SUSAN: That's not
the only place you need
a terrible weight lifted.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.303
(SUSAN GROANS)

19:40.388 --> 19:42.013
Susan and I are agreed.

19:42.098 --> 19:46.476
For the first time
in our lives, we're not
ashamed of who we are.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.687
SUSAN: I was never ashamed.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.146
Come here.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.526
What stinks?
Were you rolling
around in New Jersey?

19:54.610 --> 19:57.195
Leela, I knew I could
never make it up to you,

19:57.280 --> 19:59.030
so I did the next best thing.

19:59.115 --> 20:02.534
I put myself through
the same humiliation
I put you through.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.002
(SCREAMS)

20:18.634 --> 20:20.552
(LAUGHING)

20:21.762 --> 20:24.180
Aw. You didn't
have to do that.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.932
I didn't? Damn.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.185
Don't worry. By tomorrow,
no one will remember.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.479
Can I have another hug?
No.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.482
SUSAN: Hold your nose
and give it a go.

20:52.293 --> 20:56.755
AUTOMATED VOICE: Introducing
the all-new eyePhone 2.0.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.715
