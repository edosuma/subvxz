05:52.644 --> 05:54.270
All rise, please.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.400
The Court of California
is now in session.

05:59.609 --> 06:03.111
The Honorable Judge Lundstrom,
presiding.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.532
Please be seated.

06:34.018 --> 06:38.565
Mr. D'Ambrosia?
This case is a travesty!

06:39.149 --> 06:43.778
You have no evidence whatsoever
linking the accused to the murder.

06:43.987 --> 06:48.950
The gun found in his car was obtained
as the result of an illegal search.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.829
In the eyes of the court
it does not exist.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.459
The search was illegal
because Inspector Callahan...

06:57.876 --> 06:59.878
...and this is an old story...

07:00.086 --> 07:05.258
...did not have sufficient probable
cause for detaining Mr. Hawkins.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.763
The gun is inadmissible and
the charges against the defendant...

07:11.014 --> 07:12.849
...are dismissed!

07:13.933 --> 07:15.226
Mr. D'Ambrosia...

07:16.060 --> 07:20.940
...be assured that I will discuss
your case-preparation techniques...

07:21.149 --> 07:23.610
...with the district attorney.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.820
Bailiff, next!

07:57.310 --> 07:58.937
How many times, Callahan?

07:59.145 --> 08:03.274
You can't bust them
because you think they're dirty.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.527
"Psychic" don't cut it.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.636
Hey, Callahan.

08:35.557 --> 08:39.811
Don't look so puked-out.
Better luck next time, fool.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.527
Listen, punk.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.738
To me, you're just dog shit,
you understand?

08:50.947 --> 08:53.283
Many things can happen to dog shit.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.035
It can be scraped up with a shovel.

08:56.244 --> 09:00.415
It can dry up and blow away,
or be stepped on and squashed.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.918
My advice:
Be careful where the dog shits you.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.139
Class act, Callahan.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.350
A real class act.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.007
Loretta.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.119
You did real good with that cop!

11:01.327 --> 11:06.332
Now, I want everything.
Money, watches, rings, everything!

11:07.959 --> 11:09.043
Quick! Move!

11:09.252 --> 11:12.172
Come with me.
We'll have a little party!

11:20.472 --> 11:23.141
What are you doing,
you pig-head sucker?

11:26.186 --> 11:30.899
Every day for the last 10 years,
Loretta gives me a black coffee.

11:31.357 --> 11:35.111
Today she gives me a black coffee,
but with sugar in it.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.113
A lot of sugar.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.699
I just came back to complain.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.036
Now, you boys put those guns down.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.456
Say what?

11:50.126 --> 11:54.005
We're not just going
to let you walk out of here.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.591
Who is "we," sucker?

11:58.259 --> 12:00.261
Smith and Wesson...

12:00.887 --> 12:01.971
...and me.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.361
Go ahead...

12:58.570 --> 13:00.613
...make my day.

13:29.392 --> 13:34.189
Call D'Ambrosia in the D.A.'s office,
ask him if coffee is psychic.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.204
- Ernie.
- What?

13:49.412 --> 13:53.958
Look who's going into the hotel.
Is that who I think it is?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.752
Shit!

13:56.294 --> 13:57.754
Why me?

13:57.962 --> 14:01.591
A nothing detail!
A lousy peeper tour!

14:01.800 --> 14:03.676
So, what do we do now?

14:03.885 --> 14:06.721
Call Captain Briggs, let him decide.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.651
May I have your invitation, sir?

14:22.987 --> 14:26.115
I don't understand,
Inspector Callahan.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.791
You know the number
for San Francisco General?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.042
Yes, I do.

14:36.251 --> 14:39.754
Why don't you call,
have them send an ambulance?

14:39.963 --> 14:42.257
Tell them there's two assholes...

14:42.465 --> 14:45.969
...with multiple contusions
and sundry broken bones.

14:46.177 --> 14:49.764
- Inspector Callahan.
- I want to talk to Threlkis.

14:50.098 --> 14:54.018
At his granddaughter's wedding?
On what business?

14:54.227 --> 14:58.898
- To help him catch the bouquet.
- They have harassment laws.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.498
Sit down. Please.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.084
Champagne? It's imported.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.673
Men, like wine, should grow finer,
more civilized.

15:23.882 --> 15:27.218
They should mellow,
become more worldly.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.179
But not Callahan.

15:29.387 --> 15:33.725
Callahan is the one constant
in an ever-changing universe.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.438
Linda Doker?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.150
Fished out of the bay a month ago.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.236
Her breasts were slashed.
Her feet burned.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.072
Her face smashed to a pulp.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.950
I read about it.
A hooker.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.578
A very expensive one.

15:53.787 --> 15:58.917
In fact, her specialty was making
old scumbags mellow and worldly.

16:00.794 --> 16:04.255
She had a special customer
who said lots of things.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.633
You are a fool, Callahan.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.804
She may have been clever
and written them down.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.097
Maybe she made a copy of it.

16:13.556 --> 16:17.477
Maybe she didn't tell
when she was being tortured.

16:18.603 --> 16:22.565
What will the scumbag's bosses
say when they find out?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.152
Or his family?

16:28.446 --> 16:30.532
Maybe his ass is in a wringer.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.701
You fucking...

16:44.379 --> 16:46.047
Someone help us.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.759
Call an ambulance.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.310
Sorry, inspector, but captain...

16:59.519 --> 17:00.562
What happened?

17:00.770 --> 17:04.190
Someone grabbed their chest.
Must've seen the bill.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.733
Oh, my God.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.921
Stand back, please.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.683
Harry, wait till you see this.

17:38.892 --> 17:42.520
Some stiff got himself
a.38-caliber vasectomy.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.772
Harry, you don't look so hot.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.572
Bad night? All nookied out?

18:02.499 --> 18:07.086
Gang hit? Screwed-up drug score?
Unlucky john?

18:07.295 --> 18:09.464
Or an unhappy love affair?

18:10.507 --> 18:13.259
Don't tell me this shit's
getting to you.

18:13.468 --> 18:16.971
Not Harry Callahan. Say it ain't so.

18:17.222 --> 18:21.976
No, this stuff isn't getting to me.
Shootings, knifings, beatings.

18:22.185 --> 18:25.939
Old ladies getting bashed
for Social Security checks.

18:26.147 --> 18:29.442
Teachers being thrown out of windows.

18:29.651 --> 18:33.154
- That doesn't bother me a bit.
- Harry, take it easy.

18:33.404 --> 18:36.741
Or this job, wading through
the scum of the city.

18:37.075 --> 18:42.497
Being swept away by bigger and bigger
waves of corruption and red tape.

18:42.914 --> 18:46.000
That doesn't bother me.
You know what does?

18:46.709 --> 18:49.921
You know what makes me sick
to my stomach?

18:50.380 --> 18:53.133
Watching you stuff your face
with hot dogs.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.928
Nobody, I mean nobody,
puts ketchup on a hot dog.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.597
What the hell you talking about?

19:00.515 --> 19:05.562
Having our fingers in the holes and
the whole dike is crumbling around us.

19:06.104 --> 19:10.567
Lt. Donnelly says to get your... self
to the commissioner's office.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.402
Swell.

19:43.475 --> 19:47.729
- Leah, can I speak with you?
- Jennifer, what marvelous timing.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.357
I'm giving your work
the favorite positions.

19:51.566 --> 19:55.236
I'm afraid you'll be wasting
good selling spots.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.031
Nonsense.
They're the jewels of the exhibit.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.658
Don't be discouraged
if they don't sell immediately.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.162
They're intense. People need time
to get used to them.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.207
I'm just getting used to them myself.

20:07.415 --> 20:11.753
How can such a howl of anguish
come from such a sweet girl as you?

20:14.130 --> 20:15.173
I'm leaving town.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.050
- When?
- Today.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.804
But you'll miss the exhibit,
the opening.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.807
I'm better at painting
than receptions.

20:24.015 --> 20:27.268
Can I give you an address
to send the paintings to?

20:27.560 --> 20:31.272
Think positive. It's money
we'll send from the sales.

20:31.689 --> 20:35.527
- Where are you going?
- North, to visit someone.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.418
Look at the blond baby!

20:53.044 --> 20:54.712
Mama, check it out.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.174
How you doing?

21:01.928 --> 21:03.930
She wants to play.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.766
- Need a lift?
- Sure, baby.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.061
Then shove a jack up your ass.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.401
<i>Puta.</i>

21:22.991 --> 21:26.953
In 30 years of police work,
this is the most outrageous...

21:27.203 --> 21:29.873
...transgression of authority ever.

21:30.081 --> 21:33.460
- What the hell were you doing?
- My job.

21:33.793 --> 21:38.173
It's your job to harass and incite
an old man into a heart attack?

21:38.381 --> 21:40.633
My job's to investigate homicide.

21:41.009 --> 21:44.554
That old man is the
biggest crime lord in the West.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.098
How did I know
he would vapor-lock?

21:47.307 --> 21:48.641
You hoped he would.

21:48.850 --> 21:52.479
The Doker case is mine.
It's stuck. I broke it loose.

21:52.687 --> 21:55.273
- With threats and intimidation.
- Any way.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.360
Are you aware...

21:59.694 --> 22:03.364
...that you've destroyed
months of surveillance work?

22:03.573 --> 22:07.202
Thousands of dollars.
Hundreds of man-hours.

22:07.410 --> 22:11.956
Investigations is busting its ass
to build a case on Threlkis.

22:12.165 --> 22:17.337
He would've snaked out of it.
Maybe we saved the taxpayers money.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.507
I ought to bust your ass
down to Traffic.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.301
Or better, kick it off the force.

22:23.510 --> 22:27.347
You're a dinosaur, Callahan.
Your ideas don't fit today.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.891
What ideas are these?

22:30.642 --> 22:33.228
Murder's a crime,
it shouldn't be punished?

22:34.145 --> 22:36.940
Don't lecture me, you son of a bitch.

22:37.148 --> 22:40.527
You know who you're talking to?
You know my record?

22:40.735 --> 22:44.113
You're a legend in your own
mind.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.742
- Goddamn you, Callahan.
- Gentlemen, enough.

22:47.951 --> 22:51.913
Inspector, your methods are
different. But you get results.

22:52.122 --> 22:55.625
Often your successes
are more costly to the city...

22:55.834 --> 23:00.213
...in terms of publicity and
destruction than most failures.

23:00.421 --> 23:03.633
The press will have a field day
with this fiasco.

23:03.842 --> 23:09.347
There may be legal repercussions.
There could be attempts at retaliation.

23:09.973 --> 23:13.226
I think the inspector
should take some time off.

23:14.644 --> 23:16.187
You're suspending me?

23:17.021 --> 23:20.191
I'm suggesting you vacation
until it's calm.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.068
I'm not up for vacation.

23:22.485 --> 23:26.614
Callahan, I'm not fencing with you.
Take a few days off.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.576
Harry, a couple of days.

23:35.790 --> 23:39.002
Think things over, Callahan.
Get with it.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.546
It's a new ballgame these days.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.633
Funny, I never thought of it
as a game.

24:03.985 --> 24:07.822
I examined your sister Elizabeth,
and I tested her again.

24:08.031 --> 24:10.116
There are no changes.

24:10.325 --> 24:13.912
The computerized tomogram
shows no evidence...

24:14.120 --> 24:16.206
...of chronic subdural hematoma.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.625
Physically, she's in good shape.

24:18.958 --> 24:23.129
She remains in a vegetative state
that we can't penetrate.

24:23.338 --> 24:26.424
Not even a primitive startle response.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.844
We'll keep trying,
we're always hopeful.

24:30.053 --> 24:31.721
You should be too.

25:02.752 --> 25:04.254
Hi, baby.

25:05.755 --> 25:07.173
It's me.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.136
Jen.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.723
I missed you.

25:50.425 --> 25:51.593
Beth?

25:53.261 --> 25:55.138
I saw one of them.

25:56.598 --> 26:00.768
He just appeared on the street
in front of me.

26:01.853 --> 26:06.608
At first I thought I was having
some horrible vision.

26:07.442 --> 26:10.570
But no. He was there.

26:11.821 --> 26:14.741
Older and uglier.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.912
I followed him.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.751
For days I watched him.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.670
Then I bought a gun.

26:29.130 --> 26:31.424
I followed him to a bar.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.927
I let him pick me up.

26:35.345 --> 26:38.306
Let him drive me to a deserted spot.

26:39.057 --> 26:40.600
Let him think...

26:41.768 --> 26:45.647
It was like I was outside myself.

26:46.481 --> 26:48.733
Above me, looking down.

26:50.819 --> 26:52.487
Then he touched me.

26:53.988 --> 26:55.615
And I killed him.

27:01.246 --> 27:02.705
Beth?

27:05.416 --> 27:07.085
I love you.

30:55.104 --> 30:58.733
- Hell of a way to have a night off.
- You in on the act?

30:58.942 --> 31:02.028
No, for Christ's sake.
Back off a little.

31:02.278 --> 31:06.032
I worry about your ass.
It'll be shot off or kicked out.

31:06.241 --> 31:08.159
What else is new?

31:08.827 --> 31:11.079
They're not a bunch of junkies.

31:11.287 --> 31:14.707
To them, you killed Threlkis,
same as shooting him.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.127
They'll keep coming after you.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.754
Good, we'll know where they are.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.217
You're incredible, Callahan.

31:24.759 --> 31:27.554
You're also on vacation
as of right now.

31:28.388 --> 31:32.267
- I'm not up for vacation.
- You are, I just put you up.

31:32.475 --> 31:36.020
Go get some R and R
and stay out of trouble.

31:39.315 --> 31:42.610
You hear me, Callahan?
Peace and quiet!

33:33.388 --> 33:34.889
Good morning, Horace.

33:35.098 --> 33:38.560
Sweet Sister Sadie,
where the hell did you get that?

33:38.768 --> 33:42.063
I've had it a while.
Thought I'd get used to it.

33:42.272 --> 33:46.276
I heard about the car.
Fabulous, coming after you in tanks.

33:46.484 --> 33:51.865
Yeah, they're making those now, for
sheiks and business executives, hoods.

33:52.073 --> 33:56.995
- Impregnable to anything but artillery.
- Well, you got that covered.

34:02.792 --> 34:03.877
Not bad.

34:04.752 --> 34:08.840
My ass! You have to strain
the remains for the fingerprints.

34:10.550 --> 34:13.469
Well, this is the.44 Magnum Auto-Mag.

34:13.678 --> 34:15.472
It has a 300-grain cartridge...

34:16.097 --> 34:20.018
...and, if properly used,
it can remove the fingerprints.

34:34.407 --> 34:38.411
I got just the place for you
to go on vacation.

34:38.661 --> 34:41.414
- You got that wrong.
- You've no choice.

34:41.623 --> 34:43.123
I think I do.

34:43.333 --> 34:46.585
- You thinking about quitting?
- I might.

34:46.795 --> 34:49.839
Look at the field.
Look what you did there.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.800
Not quite good enough.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.428
You can't quit, that's what.
Okay, jamf?

34:55.637 --> 35:00.558
What's the brass going to do?
Who are they going to complain to?

35:00.767 --> 35:05.188
And the PR men kissing ass,
ass that you kicked.

35:05.396 --> 35:07.607
You're nothing but a cop.

35:07.816 --> 35:11.236
That's all you've been
and all you'll be, jamf.

35:11.444 --> 35:12.612
Thank you, doctor.

35:12.821 --> 35:17.742
Listen, when you get cut,
you'll bleed P.D. Blue, jamf.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.327
What the hell's a "jamf"?

35:19.536 --> 35:22.580
- That means you're a jive-ass mother...
- Forget I asked.

35:34.676 --> 35:36.302
Almost there.

36:03.788 --> 36:05.707
<i>I hope the house is suitable.</i>

36:05.915 --> 36:08.793
It's a bit deserted out in West Cliff.

36:09.002 --> 36:13.423
I thought you'd appreciate
the solitude as you seek inspiration.

36:13.631 --> 36:15.008
The house is lovely.

36:15.216 --> 36:20.263
I've left the fridge stocked for you.
And there's firewood for a fire.

36:20.472 --> 36:22.891
Let's see, here are the keys...

36:23.892 --> 36:26.603
...for the carousel house.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.689
Everything you need should be here.

36:29.898 --> 36:34.694
But if you have any additional wants,
we have an account in Dunstan's.

36:34.903 --> 36:36.070
Thank you.

36:36.279 --> 36:39.199
I can't tell you how happy we are...

36:39.407 --> 36:43.453
...that you're doing this work
for the Historical Society.

36:43.661 --> 36:49.083
Because your work is so impressive
and so impeccably authentic.

36:49.793 --> 36:51.586
I do my research.

36:51.836 --> 36:57.300
It must give you great satisfaction
to make old, ugly things right again.

37:02.305 --> 37:04.808
Yes, sometimes it does.

38:50.246 --> 38:52.707
Like what I brought you, baby?

39:06.346 --> 39:08.181
I like you, yeah.

40:08.324 --> 40:09.993
Tell him that you like it.

40:10.201 --> 40:13.455
Don't forget,
I get my shot at the other one.

40:13.955 --> 40:15.415
Come on, Alby.

40:15.790 --> 40:17.542
What are you, queer?

41:01.377 --> 41:02.962
There he is.

41:03.421 --> 41:07.884
- We'll show you dog shit, Callahan!
- Come on. Let's go kick some ass.

42:46.649 --> 42:49.068
There he is! We've got him!

43:20.391 --> 43:24.187
That's your idea of rest and
recreation? What's wrong with you?

43:24.395 --> 43:27.774
Briggs is berserk and
the commissioner's on my ass.

43:27.982 --> 43:29.359
I'm sorry to hear that.

43:29.567 --> 43:31.820
Can't you do anything the easy way?

43:32.028 --> 43:34.614
- Am I on the job or not?
- You are.

43:34.823 --> 43:36.825
Good. Then I'll get to it.

43:37.033 --> 43:38.868
It's not what you think.

43:39.369 --> 43:42.747
Remember that cock-shot stiff
by the Cliff House?

43:42.956 --> 43:46.417
He's been here a few years,
but in the shade.

43:46.960 --> 43:50.672
He looks small-time,
but maybe he was never caught.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.173
And?

43:52.590 --> 43:55.760
He came from San Paulo,
born and raised.

43:56.386 --> 43:59.848
I want you to go there
and find out about him.

44:00.640 --> 44:04.227
- What is this crap?
- It's a murder case, Harry.

44:04.435 --> 44:07.856
- You're shipping me out?
- I'm doing you a favor.

44:08.064 --> 44:10.191
You are a walking combat zone.

44:10.400 --> 44:12.819
People seem to die around you.

44:13.027 --> 44:15.655
I don't want civilians
taking the fall.

44:15.864 --> 44:17.490
You want to work?
Fine.

44:17.699 --> 44:21.202
You got your assignment.
Get the hell out of here.

44:21.411 --> 44:26.291
Take all the time you need. Maybe
the salt air will agree with you.

44:28.501 --> 44:29.752
Any comments?

44:33.256 --> 44:34.382
Swell.

45:58.091 --> 45:59.134
Freeze!

46:10.645 --> 46:11.980
Around the corner!

46:49.684 --> 46:53.021
What's the matter?
You trying to kill someone?

47:05.742 --> 47:06.868
Excuse me.

47:30.433 --> 47:33.603
Police officer in pursuit
of a robbery suspect.

47:33.812 --> 47:36.856
- Shag his ass!
- Get that sucker!

47:37.065 --> 47:39.526
Nail that son of a bitch!

48:16.729 --> 48:18.731
Is he all right?

48:21.484 --> 48:24.863
I guess I'd better
read you your rights.

48:29.242 --> 48:33.538
Best damn day trip I've had
since they put me in that home.

48:35.999 --> 48:37.125
Holy mackerel.

48:37.750 --> 48:41.838
So, you're the famous Harry Callahan.

48:43.506 --> 48:47.719
I'll make this short and sweet.
I'll only say it once.

48:47.969 --> 48:53.558
We don't need a hotshot to show
us dumb yokels how to do our business.

48:54.767 --> 48:59.814
We know how to do our business,
so you keep your nose out of it.

49:00.023 --> 49:01.608
You read me, Harry?

49:03.818 --> 49:05.195
Aye, aye, sir.

49:45.860 --> 49:47.570
Easy, boy.

50:05.547 --> 50:08.424
Horace, you son of a bitch.

50:15.765 --> 50:16.933
Swell.

51:07.817 --> 51:09.277
Damn, Meathead.

51:09.944 --> 51:11.362
What did you call me?

51:12.906 --> 51:15.033
I was talking to the dog.

51:17.702 --> 51:19.370
- Is that your dog?
- Yes.

51:20.789 --> 51:22.457
Why? Do you want him?

51:22.665 --> 51:26.336
If you can't control him, get a leash.
There are laws.

51:26.544 --> 51:27.879
Quiet!

51:32.926 --> 51:34.636
You seem to be all right.

51:34.969 --> 51:38.306
I'm fine,
but you'd better get it together.

51:44.854 --> 51:45.980
Quiet!

51:51.444 --> 51:52.904
This way, inspector.

51:57.075 --> 51:59.369
This is it, inspector.

52:00.620 --> 52:03.998
The coffee room and john
are down the hall.

52:04.207 --> 52:07.293
If that's all, I'll get back to work.

52:09.671 --> 52:11.714
Nice work yesterday, inspector.

52:12.132 --> 52:15.009
It was me. You saved my life.

52:15.802 --> 52:17.095
Thanks.

52:20.181 --> 52:21.224
Right.

52:21.432 --> 52:23.351
If there is anything...

52:42.620 --> 52:44.831
- Can I help you?
- Draft.

53:01.890 --> 53:06.019
My game! My game!
You son of a bitch.

53:06.227 --> 53:11.357
Come on, dickhead, fork over the bucks
before I kick your nuts up your nose!

53:11.566 --> 53:14.861
I don't have any bucks, Ray.
I pissed it away.

53:23.077 --> 53:27.373
And you? Pull something from
your pants besides your wet string.

53:27.582 --> 53:30.877
I ain't got much.
We've been here all day...

53:31.085 --> 53:33.838
...and they won't run us no more tab.

53:34.172 --> 53:38.760
Give me it, twat-lips, or
I'll give your face its first period.

53:48.853 --> 53:52.398
Want to go a couple of chugalugs
for some scratch?

53:53.316 --> 53:57.570
- What about us?
- Suck my ass with a straw!

53:59.697 --> 54:03.034
- How about it, Kruger?
- I'm out of here.

54:03.785 --> 54:07.413
Shit, Kruger!
You're good for shit anymore.

54:07.622 --> 54:09.791
What's happened to you?

54:13.795 --> 54:15.547
Hi, cutie.

54:16.548 --> 54:20.844
- Want to buy me a drink?
- Not today.

54:24.764 --> 54:29.477
Come on, sailor. I know there's some
question you want to ask me.

54:29.686 --> 54:32.439
Go ahead. You might get lucky.

54:33.857 --> 54:35.567
Only with humans.

54:43.700 --> 54:45.410
Shit!

54:50.748 --> 54:52.667
Looking for trouble, pal?

54:52.959 --> 54:55.712
Looking for friends
of George Wilburn's.

54:57.547 --> 54:59.966
- Are you a cop?
- What did he do?

55:00.216 --> 55:03.511
He lost his balls. He got killed.

58:38.143 --> 58:40.603
- Turn it off.
- What?

58:49.070 --> 58:51.406
You don't remember, do you?

58:52.574 --> 58:53.950
Remember what?

58:56.494 --> 58:59.581
My sister and I will never forget.

59:04.752 --> 59:06.004
One night...

59:06.504 --> 59:08.339
...long ago?

59:08.840 --> 59:11.050
Under the boardwalk?

59:12.469 --> 59:13.761
Remember?

01:00:17.158 --> 01:00:20.078
Looks like I owe you one, Meathead.

01:00:56.448 --> 01:00:59.075
- Inspector, what...?
- Where's Jannings?

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:04.122
Buckman Cove.
A fisherman discovered a body there.

01:01:05.373 --> 01:01:08.543
He personally checks up
on every corpse?

01:01:08.793 --> 01:01:12.422
No, sir.
But this was clearly a murder.

01:01:12.881 --> 01:01:18.344
The victim was shot twice. Once in
the head, once in the genitals.

01:01:18.553 --> 01:01:20.722
We should go to the outer office.

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:23.141
You know anyone in this picture?

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.809
Not really.

01:01:25.018 --> 01:01:28.062
I think they're friends
of the chief's son.

01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:29.355
And this girl?

01:01:31.566 --> 01:01:35.195
The dyke? Yeah.
Everybody knows Ray Parkins.

01:01:35.445 --> 01:01:37.614
She's just a local. Why?

01:01:38.615 --> 01:01:41.868
Looks familiar.
I thought I'd seen her somewhere.

01:01:42.076 --> 01:01:45.580
It's hard not to run across her
in San Paulo.

01:02:12.941 --> 01:02:14.609
Why didn't you call me?

01:02:15.652 --> 01:02:18.279
Who are you
that I should call you?

01:02:18.863 --> 01:02:21.866
What went on at your hotel
this morning?

01:02:22.408 --> 01:02:23.910
What do you think?

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:27.038
You tell me,
Mr. Big-City Inspector.

01:02:27.372 --> 01:02:30.542
Everywhere you go,
somebody gets killed...

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:34.170
...and I don't like it.
And I don't like you.

01:02:34.379 --> 01:02:37.757
So finish your research
and get out of my town.

01:02:38.007 --> 01:02:39.717
It's more than research.

01:02:39.926 --> 01:02:42.720
You're too stupid to realize that.

01:02:42.971 --> 01:02:45.390
- Get out of here.
- The m.o.'s the same.

01:02:45.598 --> 01:02:48.643
Ballistics will I.D. The bullet
as from the same gun.

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:53.022
You're not going to do anything
but get your ass out of here!

01:02:53.231 --> 01:02:58.695
Right this damn minute or
I swear to Jesus I'll lock you up!

01:03:15.628 --> 01:03:18.715
I told you
I don't want you in my store.

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:22.635
I've got to talk to you,
you stuck-up asshole.

01:03:22.844 --> 01:03:25.472
We've got nothing
to say to each other.

01:03:26.097 --> 01:03:27.307
You hear the radio?

01:03:28.683 --> 01:03:30.351
Leave my store.

01:03:30.935 --> 01:03:35.023
Kruger's dead.
They found him this morning.

01:03:35.482 --> 01:03:39.652
He had his balls splattered
all over the front of his pants.

01:03:40.779 --> 01:03:42.030
I don't care, Ray.

01:03:42.238 --> 01:03:46.034
Same thing happened to Wilburn
in San Francisco.

01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:47.535
Wilburn?

01:03:48.286 --> 01:03:49.871
Remember him?

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:52.582
He's dead.

01:03:55.877 --> 01:03:58.213
That's twice I don't care.

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:02.801
Well, you better care, prick!

01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:06.679
- I think she's come back.
- Who?

01:04:06.888 --> 01:04:10.517
Don't try to pretend with me,
you hypocritical shit!

01:04:10.725 --> 01:04:13.895
You dipped your wick
just like the others.

01:04:14.104 --> 01:04:16.564
You shut your mouth.

01:04:18.274 --> 01:04:20.819
You evil witch.

01:04:21.027 --> 01:04:24.906
What's the matter,
afraid somebody's going to hear?

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:29.702
Afraid you'll lose some of
your customers if they find out?

01:04:31.246 --> 01:04:33.665
There's nothing to find out.

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:38.461
You make me want to puke!

01:04:43.675 --> 01:04:45.552
I'm going to call Mick.

01:04:47.011 --> 01:04:52.434
You do what you want, but keep that
psycho bastard away from me.

01:04:54.894 --> 01:04:57.021
I'll tell him you said that.

01:04:59.941 --> 01:05:02.652
Watch them real good!

01:05:04.154 --> 01:05:06.406
And be prepared...

01:05:07.282 --> 01:05:08.450
...boy scout.

01:05:38.855 --> 01:05:42.025
Now, see. Just like I told you.

01:05:42.192 --> 01:05:45.361
Hurt me this time,
and it'll be your last.

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:50.200
Hurt you, babe?
What do you take me for?

01:05:51.159 --> 01:05:55.205
- Let me up.
- Sure, babe, sure.

01:05:55.455 --> 01:05:57.290
In a minute.

01:05:57.999 --> 01:06:00.001
Say it first.

01:06:02.462 --> 01:06:03.963
Say it!

01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:05.590
- Mickey.
- Yes.

01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:07.091
Baby...

01:06:07.675 --> 01:06:09.511
...you're so beautiful.

01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:12.764
I want you, Mickey.

01:06:13.014 --> 01:06:16.476
- How bad do you want me?
- I want you bad.

01:06:17.018 --> 01:06:19.187
You're so strong.

01:06:20.438 --> 01:06:22.690
You're all a man should be.

01:06:22.941 --> 01:06:25.026
Baby, that's right.

01:06:25.693 --> 01:06:28.488
Keep talking, baby. Come on.

01:06:31.366 --> 01:06:35.036
- Don't stop now, bitch!
- I can't! The phone!

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.212
Who the fuck is this?

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:47.215
Well...

01:06:47.882 --> 01:06:49.134
...how do?

01:06:50.677 --> 01:06:52.971
Getting near my time to call you.

01:06:54.222 --> 01:06:56.307
I like it like this.

01:06:56.683 --> 01:07:01.312
Maybe we'll just keep it this way,
since you know how to find me.

01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:10.488
That so?

01:07:12.615 --> 01:07:16.953
We'll just have to do something
about that, won't we?

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:40.059
Horace, do me a favor. Get me
the ballistics on the Wilburn killing?

01:07:40.268 --> 01:07:41.352
The what?

01:07:41.561 --> 01:07:44.355
I got him.
Almost as ugly as you are.

01:07:44.564 --> 01:07:46.441
<i>He does have his good points.</i>

01:07:46.649 --> 01:07:49.194
Can you wire the report
in the morning?

01:07:49.444 --> 01:07:53.531
You keep your ass covered
until I can get this arranged.

01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:54.991
Thanks.

01:08:14.302 --> 01:08:15.470
Kruger.

01:08:15.678 --> 01:08:16.930
Okay.

01:08:17.514 --> 01:08:20.517
- If Chief Jannings finds out...
- He won't.

01:08:20.725 --> 01:08:22.810
Just get me the information.

01:08:23.019 --> 01:08:25.772
Names, where they are,
where they work.

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:27.732
It's not easy, inspector.

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:30.944
I won't risk taking that photo
off his wall.

01:08:31.152 --> 01:08:34.613
One other thing,
could you get me Kruger's sheet?

01:08:35.281 --> 01:08:36.908
Anything else?

01:08:37.158 --> 01:08:38.910
Just the address.

01:08:54.259 --> 01:08:57.595
Mrs. Kruger?
Can I have a word with you?

01:08:57.804 --> 01:09:01.099
- You from the insurance company?
- No.

01:09:01.307 --> 01:09:04.769
If you don't want fish,
get your ass out of here.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.020
Mrs. Kruger, my name's Callahan.

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:09.774
You got shit in your ears, buddy?

01:09:11.693 --> 01:09:15.154
I'd like to ask a few questions
about your husband.

01:09:15.363 --> 01:09:19.242
That lousy son of a bitch?
He leaves me nothing.

01:09:19.993 --> 01:09:24.330
I'm up to my ass in bills.
He let the insurance run out.

01:09:24.538 --> 01:09:27.375
Then he's killed
looking at dirty pictures...

01:09:27.584 --> 01:09:30.962
...when he ain't touched me
in months, bastard.

01:09:31.462 --> 01:09:35.175
Can't you see our sister's mourning?
Get out of here.

01:09:35.716 --> 01:09:38.470
Why don't you go suck
some fish heads?

01:09:55.487 --> 01:09:57.489
Don't even think about it.

01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:10.877
Well, I'll come back...

01:10:11.169 --> 01:10:13.379
...when you're less bereaved.

01:10:45.703 --> 01:10:47.413
You've come a long way.

01:10:48.706 --> 01:10:51.835
Somebody told us to get it together.

01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:55.630
I have a feeling
you've heard that before.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.882
Sorry if I was a little gruff...

01:10:58.091 --> 01:11:01.302
...but you and your friend
took me by surprise.

01:11:01.511 --> 01:11:04.347
Buy me a beer,
and we'll call it even.

01:11:06.015 --> 01:11:07.517
Stay, Meathead.

01:11:13.273 --> 01:11:15.859
Waiter, a beer for Mr...?

01:11:16.568 --> 01:11:17.652
Callahan.

01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:21.072
- And another for me, please.
- Right away.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.992
I'm Jennifer Spencer.

01:11:24.451 --> 01:11:26.161
How's police business?

01:11:27.745 --> 01:11:29.789
What makes you think I'm a cop?

01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:35.044
I saw the commotion. You're either
a cop or public enemy number one.

01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:39.883
Some people might say both.

01:11:40.592 --> 01:11:41.926
Really? Who?

01:11:42.594 --> 01:11:46.473
Bozos with big brass nameplates
on their desks...

01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:50.226
...and asses the shape
of the seats of their chairs.

01:11:50.935 --> 01:11:52.020
Why?

01:11:53.104 --> 01:11:56.524
It's a question of methods.
Everybody wants results...

01:11:56.733 --> 01:12:00.361
...but nobody wants to do
what they must to get them.

01:12:01.654 --> 01:12:02.864
And you do?

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:05.658
I do what I have to.

01:12:06.701 --> 01:12:10.705
I'm glad, Callahan.
But you're an endangered species.

01:12:11.414 --> 01:12:15.460
It's the age of lapsed
responsibility and defeated justice.

01:12:15.752 --> 01:12:18.671
"Eye for an eye" means
"Only if you're caught."

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.384
Then it's an indefinite postponement
and "settle out of court."

01:12:23.802 --> 01:12:26.846
Does that sound profound
or just boring?

01:12:28.556 --> 01:12:32.185
Sorry, I'm sure you get
that sort of thing often.

01:12:34.312 --> 01:12:36.397
No, I don't hear it enough.

01:12:37.857 --> 01:12:41.528
I promise to adjourn Philosophy 101.

01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:55.375
- What do you do for a living?
- I paint.

01:12:56.417 --> 01:12:57.794
Paint?

01:12:58.545 --> 01:13:00.296
Houses, cars, what?

01:13:00.922 --> 01:13:02.006
Horses.

01:13:03.216 --> 01:13:04.384
Horses?

01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:05.969
Hobbyhorses.

01:13:06.344 --> 01:13:08.847
I'm restoring the carousel here.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.102
You don't seem like
a typical San Paulo policeman.

01:13:14.352 --> 01:13:15.603
I'm not.

01:13:15.895 --> 01:13:17.939
- Typical?
- San Paulo.

01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:20.650
San Francisco P.D., Homicide.

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.408
Don't say this is your idea
of a vacation.

01:13:30.243 --> 01:13:32.412
No, I'm down here on a case.

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:35.331
Just gathering information in general.

01:13:35.832 --> 01:13:37.542
Anything interesting?

01:13:40.295 --> 01:13:41.754
It's coming around.

01:13:43.506 --> 01:13:45.216
Got any theories?

01:13:46.468 --> 01:13:50.472
Somebody's doing some killing
and I think it'll go on.

01:13:51.723 --> 01:13:54.309
- A psycho?
- Probably.

01:13:55.769 --> 01:13:59.189
It could be somebody
just collecting on a debt.

01:14:00.231 --> 01:14:01.608
Revenge?

01:14:02.066 --> 01:14:05.695
The oldest motivation
known to mankind.

01:14:06.237 --> 01:14:08.281
You don't approve?

01:14:09.157 --> 01:14:11.201
Till it breaks the law.

01:14:16.289 --> 01:14:19.083
Are you gonna want
another one of these?

01:14:19.459 --> 01:14:21.961
No, I work early.

01:14:22.212 --> 01:14:24.297
- I'll get that.
- No, no.

01:14:24.506 --> 01:14:25.799
A deal's a deal.

01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:31.513
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:35.433
- Hey, is that your dog?
- Why, you want him?

01:14:41.314 --> 01:14:42.732
Swell.

01:16:17.452 --> 01:16:19.454
The witch was right.

01:16:20.038 --> 01:16:21.539
It is you.

01:16:22.916 --> 01:16:24.876
Put down the gun.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:35.345
Now look, you've got to
understand something.

01:16:35.553 --> 01:16:39.808
That was a long time ago.
It was 10 years ago.

01:16:40.391 --> 01:16:42.811
I was just a kid.

01:16:43.228 --> 01:16:47.482
I didn't mean anything by it.
I know it was wrong...

01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:49.943
...but I was drunk.

01:16:50.193 --> 01:16:52.695
I didn't even know what I was doing!

01:16:54.114 --> 01:16:58.451
I'm a businessman now.
I'm making money.

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:02.372
I can give you some of it.
You need money, right?

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:06.584
Please.

01:17:07.001 --> 01:17:11.548
It wasn't my fault.
The others made me do it.

01:17:12.298 --> 01:17:14.300
Don't make me beg.

01:17:14.509 --> 01:17:19.931
It wasn't that bad, was it?
Not bad enough to kill me for.

01:17:20.515 --> 01:17:24.936
People sell it every day.
They give it away.

01:17:25.145 --> 01:17:28.648
Christ, don't.
Please.

01:17:29.065 --> 01:17:31.609
Don't shoot me.

01:18:10.106 --> 01:18:11.191
Come in.

01:18:12.817 --> 01:18:14.277
Close the door.

01:18:20.325 --> 01:18:21.409
Sit down.

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:32.921
It's for you.

01:18:38.802 --> 01:18:44.265
What's going on? Jannings
has got the commissioner's ear.

01:18:44.974 --> 01:18:48.520
<i>He's a good guy.</i>
<i>Go easy with him, will you?</i>

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:52.857
<i>Harry, you don 't have</i>
<i>a hell of a lot of friends upstairs.</i>

01:18:53.858 --> 01:18:56.277
<i>Don 't screw yourself, okay?</i>

01:18:56.778 --> 01:18:58.363
<i>Understand?</i>

01:18:59.739 --> 01:19:01.908
No, I don't understand...

01:19:02.492 --> 01:19:03.785
...at all.

01:19:09.541 --> 01:19:13.878
Here's the ballistic reports for
the Kruger and Wilburn killing.

01:19:14.879 --> 01:19:18.383
I think you'll find
they match up perfectly.

01:19:27.809 --> 01:19:29.769
So that's the story, kid.

01:19:29.978 --> 01:19:33.606
So our little college honey
is collecting dues?

01:19:33.815 --> 01:19:35.900
You got it.
Heads up.

01:19:37.193 --> 01:19:40.697
- So, what are we going to do?
- We snuff her.

01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:46.453
This town's got thousands of people.

01:19:48.455 --> 01:19:52.000
Maybe she's not even staying here.
How do we find her?

01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:54.335
We don't.

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:58.214
- What do you mean?
- We wait.

01:19:59.048 --> 01:20:02.594
She's coming after you, too,
sometime, right?

01:20:03.261 --> 01:20:04.471
I suppose.

01:20:04.679 --> 01:20:06.639
And we'll be here.

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:10.101
Make her feel real welcome.

01:20:12.228 --> 01:20:14.647
What about Tyrone and Alby?

01:20:14.856 --> 01:20:19.402
I don't give a fuck about Tyrone.
And Alby's covered.

01:20:20.987 --> 01:20:26.075
How? The guy's a zombie. He doesn't
even know if he's pissing himself.

01:20:26.284 --> 01:20:27.869
He's covered.

01:20:29.829 --> 01:20:31.039
Okay.

01:21:05.865 --> 01:21:09.953
- You never give up, do you?
- It's my job, remember?

01:21:10.161 --> 01:21:12.664
What do you want from me, Callahan?

01:21:12.872 --> 01:21:16.084
Why are you delaying
this investigation?

01:21:16.292 --> 01:21:18.336
Every available man's on the street.

01:21:18.545 --> 01:21:22.298
We're logging more overtime
than the town can afford.

01:21:22.507 --> 01:21:24.092
We'll get that maniac.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:29.431
- Do you think the killings are random?
- I reject no theory at this time.

01:21:29.639 --> 01:21:33.518
There's been no truth declared on the
muggings...

01:21:33.726 --> 01:21:37.063
...the burglaries,
the drunken driving.

01:21:37.272 --> 01:21:41.317
All the less-headline-grabbing crimes
that we face everyday.

01:21:41.526 --> 01:21:43.945
Now, we're doing the best we can.

01:21:44.946 --> 01:21:47.282
Maybe that's not good enough.

01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:52.954
Callahan, this is not, repeat, not,
your jurisdiction, so stay out of it.

01:21:53.204 --> 01:21:54.372
I'm warning you.

01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:59.544
Aren't you curious as to why I'm here?

01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:03.358
Coming to the party I told you about?

01:23:03.566 --> 01:23:07.028
I can't. My sister's visiting.

01:23:07.403 --> 01:23:09.280
She a college girl, too?

01:23:09.697 --> 01:23:12.283
No, she's a junior in high school.

01:23:13.243 --> 01:23:14.410
Bring her.

01:23:14.828 --> 01:23:16.538
The more, the merrier.

01:23:17.705 --> 01:23:19.165
I don't think so.

01:23:20.917 --> 01:23:24.587
What's the matter?
Us locals not good enough for you?

01:23:25.547 --> 01:23:29.259
It's not that!
You don't understand.

01:23:30.176 --> 01:23:33.680
All right, we'll come,
but we have to leave early.

01:23:34.848 --> 01:23:36.558
Leave whenever you like.

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:38.643
Who knows?

01:23:39.769 --> 01:23:41.688
You may have a nice time.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.385
It's Callahan.
Can I talk to Bennett?

01:24:54.594 --> 01:24:56.054
<i>I'll patch you through.</i>

01:25:00.517 --> 01:25:01.810
<i>Bennett here.</i>

01:25:02.185 --> 01:25:07.232
Bennett, would you run a plate for me?
1 -Adam-Queen-Ida-1-7-5.

01:25:07.941 --> 01:25:09.484
<i>All right, inspector.</i>

01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:25.500
What the fuck are you doing?

01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:28.628
- You fucking pig!
- Give me a little!

01:25:28.837 --> 01:25:30.880
Get your hands off of me!

01:25:31.089 --> 01:25:33.049
All I wanted was...

01:25:36.177 --> 01:25:38.430
Wait!
What the hell is this?

01:25:38.638 --> 01:25:41.266
Police officer.
I have a few questions.

01:25:42.392 --> 01:25:43.726
My ass!

01:25:50.942 --> 01:25:52.735
Get him, goddamn it!

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.530
Son of a bitch!

01:25:55.989 --> 01:25:58.825
You bastard!
Knock it off!

01:25:59.033 --> 01:26:00.034
Stop it!

01:26:06.166 --> 01:26:10.920
Now, you're coming downtown
and answering some questions.

01:26:11.171 --> 01:26:15.508
Don't answer nothing, Mick!
Son of a bitch, I'll get a lawyer!

01:26:15.717 --> 01:26:18.845
He'll be out tomorrow,
you fucking bastard!

01:27:17.237 --> 01:27:19.280
The bitch is here.

01:27:26.663 --> 01:27:27.997
So tell me.

01:27:29.499 --> 01:27:31.835
How's your slut sister?

01:27:56.693 --> 01:27:57.735
Book him!

01:28:39.319 --> 01:28:42.197
A little late for wave-watching,
isn't it?

01:28:44.324 --> 01:28:46.117
I couldn't sleep.

01:28:46.326 --> 01:28:48.369
- A beer?
- Thanks.

01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:55.835
It's not safe to be out alone
after dark.

01:28:56.169 --> 01:28:59.297
Life is full of risks, isn't it?

01:29:04.761 --> 01:29:07.680
I better go home.
Thanks for the beer.

01:29:07.889 --> 01:29:12.894
- Did you bicycle down here?
- No, I walked. It relaxes me.

01:29:13.103 --> 01:29:14.938
I'll give you a ride home.

01:29:15.730 --> 01:29:17.357
No, that's all right.

01:29:17.565 --> 01:29:20.026
It's okay, it relaxes me.

01:29:27.033 --> 01:29:28.284
This is it.

01:29:32.747 --> 01:29:35.125
Well, thanks for the lift.

01:29:38.169 --> 01:29:41.464
Want something stronger
to drink than beer?

01:29:42.048 --> 01:29:43.383
Come on in.

01:29:48.012 --> 01:29:49.848
I don't mind if I do.

01:30:02.444 --> 01:30:04.237
I'll get some brandy.

01:30:38.688 --> 01:30:40.106
Unusual.

01:30:43.276 --> 01:30:46.696
I have a rule.
Never drink with a critic.

01:30:51.868 --> 01:30:54.412
You want to be alone tonight?

01:30:57.499 --> 01:30:59.000
Neither do I.

01:32:36.556 --> 01:32:41.978
Harry, wake up, sucker. The heat's
off and we're going to celebrate.

01:32:53.156 --> 01:32:55.283
Well, well, well.

01:33:07.212 --> 01:33:10.340
Kiss your ass good-bye, Sambo.

01:33:42.705 --> 01:33:43.832
Bennett.

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:49.087
Bennett, send someone to Ray
Parkins' place. She's getting ripe.

01:33:49.295 --> 01:33:54.175
Bring that punk to the interrogation
room. I've got questions for him.

01:33:54.384 --> 01:33:57.262
Sorry, inspector, he's been released.

01:33:57.512 --> 01:33:58.596
<i>Who sprung him?</i>

01:33:58.805 --> 01:34:01.433
Kruger's brother-in-law picked him up.

01:34:01.724 --> 01:34:02.851
Swell.

01:34:03.059 --> 01:34:07.188
<i>Inspector, I'll get</i>
<i>that license plate number you wanted.</i>

01:34:07.397 --> 01:34:10.984
No, forget about that.
That turned out to be nothing.

01:34:11.192 --> 01:34:12.193
Thanks.

01:34:23.246 --> 01:34:27.876
I don't know where they are.
Just leave me alone!

01:34:44.392 --> 01:34:46.811
Hotshot cop.

01:34:48.563 --> 01:34:50.607
Your ass is mine!

01:35:38.363 --> 01:35:39.781
Mick, the gun!

01:35:45.078 --> 01:35:46.371
Cocksucker!

01:37:38.566 --> 01:37:39.859
Drop the gun.

01:37:59.963 --> 01:38:01.798
He couldn't live with it.

01:38:03.633 --> 01:38:05.468
The other vermin didn't care.

01:38:06.886 --> 01:38:09.722
But the guilt ate at his gut...

01:38:10.014 --> 01:38:11.599
...like an acid.

01:38:12.851 --> 01:38:15.270
He actually wanted you to come back.

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:19.274
He used to sit, waiting,
praying that you'd come back.

01:38:22.569 --> 01:38:25.155
One night
he couldn't wait any longer.

01:38:25.655 --> 01:38:30.577
He just got in his car and smashed
himself into a retaining wall.

01:38:31.286 --> 01:38:36.207
Now you're here
and he doesn't even know it.

01:38:37.917 --> 01:38:39.419
It's my fault.

01:38:40.503 --> 01:38:43.506
I should have let him
be punished then...

01:38:43.965 --> 01:38:46.134
...along with the other filth.

01:38:47.135 --> 01:38:51.014
He's my only child.
His mother died giving birth to him.

01:38:52.265 --> 01:38:54.768
We're all each other have.

01:38:55.727 --> 01:38:58.521
I was afraid for him.
I was afraid for me.

01:38:58.938 --> 01:39:03.109
You see, I was a public figure.

01:39:03.818 --> 01:39:04.903
So...

01:39:05.612 --> 01:39:07.489
...I did things. I fixed it.

01:39:08.948 --> 01:39:12.994
And now I want you to just go.

01:39:14.579 --> 01:39:16.664
Let it end.

01:39:18.666 --> 01:39:20.627
There's one left.

01:39:22.796 --> 01:39:24.005
And I've got him...

01:39:25.048 --> 01:39:26.841
...in my jail.

01:39:27.092 --> 01:39:29.677
You just leave him to me.

01:39:29.886 --> 01:39:32.889
He's preyed on Alby and me ever since.

01:39:34.015 --> 01:39:36.684
That too is going to end.

01:39:37.685 --> 01:39:40.688
Is that so, Lester boy?

01:39:51.157 --> 01:39:53.785
Put down the piece, Lester.

01:39:54.077 --> 01:39:57.747
Or I'll splatter what's left
of the retard's brains...

01:39:57.956 --> 01:40:00.041
...all over the floor.

01:40:05.755 --> 01:40:06.965
Hi, babe.

01:40:12.178 --> 01:40:15.056
Is this what you had in mind for me?

01:40:46.755 --> 01:40:49.257
You almost fucked up here, Lester!

01:40:49.466 --> 01:40:52.844
But don't worry,
I'll take care of everything.

01:40:53.052 --> 01:40:58.349
And you won't have to do a damn thing
but sit on your fat ass.

01:41:00.977 --> 01:41:05.607
But first, me and the little babe
are going to relive some old times.

01:41:28.671 --> 01:41:32.759
Damn, Mick! You didn't say nothing
about doing the chief.

01:41:33.134 --> 01:41:35.804
Don't sweat it. It's a freebie.

01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:40.433
We just signed
our little honey's name to it.

01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:56.825
Horace?

01:41:58.868 --> 01:42:00.620
Shit, man.

01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:44.539
Hey, you remember this place, babe?

01:42:47.292 --> 01:42:50.253
Sure. You remember.

01:42:53.923 --> 01:42:58.803
I wonder if it's any better
after all these years.

01:43:02.974 --> 01:43:07.437
If there's anything left,
you boys can have a piece.

01:43:12.108 --> 01:43:15.445
Okay, you prickless scum!

01:43:15.653 --> 01:43:19.866
You want to try it again?
Think you can get it up this time?

01:43:20.074 --> 01:43:23.203
Think you can make it work this time?

01:43:23.828 --> 01:43:27.248
You want me, you filthy maggot?

01:43:27.457 --> 01:43:28.833
You take me!

01:43:29.042 --> 01:43:33.755
Because this time
you'll have to rape my dead body!

01:43:52.273 --> 01:43:53.316
No!

01:43:56.194 --> 01:43:58.154
The bitch is mine!

01:43:58.655 --> 01:44:00.281
All right.

01:44:22.637 --> 01:44:25.515
You lousy cunt!

01:44:39.404 --> 01:44:41.865
- You all right, Mick?
- Get her!

01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:51.624
Get the bitch!

01:45:25.617 --> 01:45:26.659
Where is she?

01:46:01.194 --> 01:46:03.863
You ain't getting out of here.

01:47:47.133 --> 01:47:49.385
The door!
Get her!

01:47:57.894 --> 01:48:00.230
No you don't, sweetie.

01:48:10.115 --> 01:48:12.158
Holy shit!

01:51:04.497 --> 01:51:08.084
Come on, cop!
Come up and enjoy the party!

01:51:08.293 --> 01:51:12.255
We've got a class reunion
happening up here!

01:51:14.924 --> 01:51:17.302
Let the girl go, punk!

01:51:17.552 --> 01:51:21.931
Let my baby go?
I can't do that!

01:51:22.599 --> 01:51:24.267
This is my baby.

01:51:25.059 --> 01:51:27.103
This is my prize.

01:51:27.687 --> 01:51:30.523
Come on, cop!
You know I can't do that!

01:51:30.774 --> 01:51:32.942
I can't just let her go!

01:51:33.151 --> 01:51:35.862
Then it would be just you and me!

01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:42.744
Come on, make my day.

01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:48.166
That's not a bad idea, is it?

01:52:34.087 --> 01:52:35.922
What happens now?

01:52:39.217 --> 01:52:42.679
- I guess now I've got to...
- Read me my rights?

01:52:43.596 --> 01:52:46.015
What exactly are my rights?

01:52:46.391 --> 01:52:50.603
Where was the concern for my rights
when I was being beaten?

01:52:50.812 --> 01:52:54.774
What about my sister's rights
when she was brutalized?

01:52:55.233 --> 01:52:57.318
There's a thing called justice.

01:52:57.527 --> 01:53:01.364
And was it justice
that they should all walk away?

01:53:02.407 --> 01:53:04.909
You'll never understand, Callahan.

01:53:06.119 --> 01:53:09.372
Inspector,
we found a.38 snub in his belt.

01:53:18.923 --> 01:53:20.925
Run it through ballistics.

01:53:21.134 --> 01:53:25.013
I think you'll find his gun
was used in all the killings.

01:53:25.722 --> 01:53:27.432
Then it's over?

01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:31.186
Yeah, it's over.
