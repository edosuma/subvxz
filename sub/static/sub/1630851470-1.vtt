WEBVTT

00:23.000 --> 00:25.125
We should've done this ourselves.

00:25.166 --> 00:27.666
We know the king's palace better than your patsy does.

00:28.958 --> 00:31.291
Teela hasn't failed us yet.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.791
She'll find what we seek.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.916
With that sword, the Power of Grayskull

00:36.958 --> 00:39.500
will soon be ours.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.291
How's the nation of Eternos this evening?

00:56.333 --> 00:59.750
Quiet as a shadow, King Randor.

00:59.791 --> 01:02.708
Never trust shadows, General.

01:43.208 --> 01:45.375
You catch that game of modulok?

01:45.416 --> 01:47.500
No, modulok's too complicated.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.791
Running on your hands and passing with your feet?

01:49.833 --> 01:51.375
No, thank you.

01:54.291 --> 01:56.875
I'll take it from here, Soldier.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.416
Of course, General Dolos.

02:06.875 --> 02:09.416
I'll take it from here, Soldier.

02:09.458 --> 02:12.291
Evelyn better pay me this time.

02:19.333 --> 02:21.625
Oh, come on!

02:26.541 --> 02:29.416
'Word witch didn't say there'd be this many to choose from.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.000
-Okay. -

02:37.791 --> 02:39.208
Which one of you is gonna give me

02:39.250 --> 02:42.458
that trademark Teela Grayskull tingle?

02:44.291 --> 02:45.125
Hmm.

03:00.833 --> 03:03.875
I've been contracted to go through all this trouble to steal a--

03:03.916 --> 03:06.250
Sword, Eternia, Grayskull,

03:06.291 --> 03:07.833
secrets, Eternia, Power,

03:07.875 --> 03:11.666
Masters of the Universe, Masters of the Universe.

03:11.708 --> 03:14.000
That was way more than a tingle.

03:14.041 --> 03:17.416
Drop the sword!

03:17.458 --> 03:20.666
I'll just put it right... here.

03:20.708 --> 03:24.125
Did she just continue to steal?

03:24.166 --> 03:25.083
Sorry.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.125
I just needed my hands free

03:26.166 --> 03:28.625
to do... this.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.458
Oh, no!

03:30.500 --> 03:32.041
How will we ever grab our swords

03:32.083 --> 03:34.541
with our other hands?

03:34.583 --> 03:36.791
Oh, sorry. My thumb stuck.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.750
Able to do... this!

03:41.125 --> 03:42.958
Oh, yeah, much better.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.708
Somebody stop her!

03:45.750 --> 03:47.083
-You! Halt! -

03:47.125 --> 03:48.250
Get her now!

03:48.291 --> 03:49.791
Go! Go! Get her!

03:55.833 --> 03:59.458
Ah-ha-ha, one of my legs fell asleep, sorry.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.041
Must you have brought your apprentice along?

04:02.083 --> 04:03.333
You! Halt!

04:08.208 --> 04:10.166
Duncan didn't bring the Royal Guard

04:10.208 --> 04:12.083
to the extraction point.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.083
Just sayin'.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.958
Incoming!

04:33.750 --> 04:36.125
What an unfortunate turn of events...

04:36.166 --> 04:37.125
for them.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.333
Laminae.

04:40.333 --> 04:41.333
No!

04:41.375 --> 04:43.416
They're just doing their jobs!

04:48.500 --> 04:49.916
Hachaos!

04:51.333 --> 04:53.916
Give me the sword, Hand Witch.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.250
That sword does not belong to her.

05:00.958 --> 05:03.375
Start the engine, kid. This is a bust.

05:03.416 --> 05:05.500
We're on our way to you.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.291
The sword is right there.

05:09.333 --> 05:13.541
Our key to universal unstoppable power is right there!

05:16.416 --> 05:18.041
We don't gotta find the sword again,

05:18.083 --> 05:19.333
just the girl.

05:19.375 --> 05:20.750
Let's move.

05:38.791 --> 05:43.083
Bring the sword to the champion.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.208
What champion?

05:47.250 --> 05:49.833
I have the Power!

06:48.750 --> 06:50.416
Hang in there, Kitty. I've got you.

06:50.458 --> 06:53.458
Just crawl onto my shoulders and we can both go home.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.875
No.

06:54.916 --> 06:56.666
What do you mean, no?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.250
I don't want us to fall.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.125
We won't fall.

07:02.375 --> 07:04.833
We won't fall...

07:04.875 --> 07:07.208
...if you get on my shoulders right now.

07:10.708 --> 07:13.000
Did you, like, eat rocks today?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.583
I thought they were potatoes.

07:14.625 --> 07:17.125
Did they taste like potatoes?

07:17.166 --> 07:19.791
I've never had a potato before.

07:19.833 --> 07:22.958
--How am I supposed to know?

07:24.458 --> 07:25.750
You jump the rest of the way.

07:25.791 --> 07:26.833
What about you?

07:26.875 --> 07:28.625
I'll be fine.

07:34.666 --> 07:36.875
Dragonfly.

07:37.666 --> 07:38.875
-No. -Dragonfly.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.916
No, don't do it. Focus.

07:40.958 --> 07:42.291
Dragonfly!

07:54.666 --> 07:56.708
Adam, are you two done yet?

07:56.750 --> 08:01.125
Or do you wanna hang out some more?

08:01.166 --> 08:02.875
How long have you been there?

08:02.916 --> 08:05.333
Long enough to work on that joke.

08:05.375 --> 08:07.416
Thought it might defuse the tension.

08:07.458 --> 08:10.333
Way to take my mind off of imminent death, Krass.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.125
Thanks.

08:12.166 --> 08:14.125
What are best friends for?

08:18.708 --> 08:20.166
You weren't on tracker duty today.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.125
What are you doing out here?

08:21.166 --> 08:22.375
Cringer's missing,

08:22.416 --> 08:23.583
and this part of the woods

08:23.625 --> 08:25.166
has the best snacks for grabbing,

08:25.208 --> 08:28.166
so I figured why not start looking for him here?

08:28.208 --> 08:31.666
Wait, did you just say Cringer was missing?

08:31.708 --> 08:34.833
Kitty, did you come out here looking for your uncle?

08:34.875 --> 08:36.208
Maybe.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.208
He said he wanted to go hunting again.

08:39.250 --> 08:42.000
Puh! He can't hunt without claws.

08:42.041 --> 08:43.833
Try telling him that.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.208
Contain. Shut.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.166
--Push.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.875
Release me, or incur the wrath of my tribe,

08:49.916 --> 08:51.958
you Beastopoid brutes.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.666
Quarry talks like it is people.

08:53.708 --> 08:56.208
Quarry talks like we are people.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.250
Don't you poachers want more from life

09:00.291 --> 09:01.750
than caging and hurting animals?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.000
Why not rise up against your keeper?

09:04.041 --> 09:06.291
Try living for yourselves.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.458
Initiate capture.

09:12.208 --> 09:15.208
An uprising would displease our keeper.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.541
Query for quarry: what happened to you

09:17.583 --> 09:20.041
when last you displeased our keeper?

09:23.250 --> 09:27.166
Fair point, my subservient captors.

09:29.083 --> 09:30.708
R'qazz will be most pleased

09:30.750 --> 09:33.041
to have you back in the fight pit.

09:33.083 --> 09:36.291
He may  add your skull to his trophy belt after your loss.

09:38.041 --> 09:40.708
Oh, what an honor.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.416
Let me at those circuit brains.

10:02.458 --> 10:03.625
No time for the bots.

10:03.666 --> 10:06.083
We gotta spring Cringer.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.458
I knew you'd come for me.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.666
We needed a faster ride home anyway.

10:12.708 --> 10:15.041
Stand back.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.666
Hang on!

10:18.708 --> 10:20.708
Initiate stowaway protocol.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.083
Great plan!

10:38.125 --> 10:39.166
Now what?

10:39.208 --> 10:40.958
You up for a game of ram-ball?

10:42.666 --> 10:44.916
I'm wearing my helmet, ain't I?

10:46.166 --> 10:49.875
Adam of the Tiger Tribe risks it all...

10:49.916 --> 10:51.583
...to send Krass to the net.

10:51.625 --> 10:55.791
Will she make the...

10:55.833 --> 10:59.500
Have I mentioned how much I hate this game?

10:59.541 --> 11:02.333
...goal?

11:02.375 --> 11:03.916
Ow! Whoa!

11:18.041 --> 11:20.500
Ow.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.416
Happy to see you too.

11:26.458 --> 11:27.666
But hug me any tighter,

11:27.708 --> 11:29.958
and I'll let them keep you next time.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.916
Wait. What happened to Krass?

11:31.958 --> 11:34.041
Tiger Tribe for the win!

11:34.083 --> 11:36.541
Cringer, next time you feel like

11:36.583 --> 11:38.041
taking on some Beastopoids,

11:38.083 --> 11:39.875
let us know, huh?

11:39.916 --> 11:42.250
Now, where would the fun in that be?

11:42.291 --> 11:44.458
Tiger Tribe forever?

11:44.500 --> 11:47.500
Tiger Tribe forever.

11:54.833 --> 11:57.708
Why would you go hunting alone again?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.958
Everyone in the tribe does their part.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.458
Even without my claws, I'd like to still do mine.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.666
Spoken like a true "Stripe."

12:05.708 --> 12:08.541
I don't need a special tattoo to be a part of the tribe.

12:08.583 --> 12:11.541
You keep saying that, but I never see you leave.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.166
Now, now, Krass'tine.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.833
Every lost soul the tribe adopts

12:14.875 --> 12:17.000
gets their stripes when they so choose.

12:17.041 --> 12:19.083
If Adam isn't ready to set aside his cuff

12:19.125 --> 12:20.416
and get his stripe,

12:20.458 --> 12:21.708
Adam isn't ready.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.750
This is all I have from my life before.

12:24.791 --> 12:26.500
What if whoever lost me

12:26.541 --> 12:28.833
doesn't recognize me without this?

12:30.416 --> 12:33.166
It's been ten years.

12:33.208 --> 12:35.625
Ah, they probably stopped looking for you by now.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.791
Whatever, helmet head.

12:49.791 --> 12:51.791
Kitty, what you doing?

12:51.833 --> 12:53.833
There's a lady in the tree.

12:53.875 --> 12:57.333
Um, can we help you, tree lady?

12:57.375 --> 13:01.125
Uh, your village is full of cats.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.916
I'm apparently afraid of cats.

13:03.958 --> 13:05.625
Then why did you come out here

13:05.666 --> 13:07.958
to where the Tiger Tribe lives?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.208
A voice in my head told me to.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.541
Ask it how much it knows about cats being able to climb trees.

13:13.583 --> 13:14.791
Why?

13:22.083 --> 13:23.416
I got her!

13:25.875 --> 13:27.458
Adam.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.375
Teela.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.833
Magic!

13:37.291 --> 13:39.041
-What if she got caught? -We'd know.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.250
I've been listening to the Royal security channels.

13:41.291 --> 13:44.250
Right, because of all the crime we're doing.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.458
This is about revenge on the king,

13:46.500 --> 13:49.583
We're not not doing crime, though.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.291
You find her yet?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.291
We're here. Descend.

14:03.916 --> 14:07.250
Trahentium super revelare...

14:07.291 --> 14:09.458
Is that an actual poacher ship?

14:16.750 --> 14:18.458
The sword doesn't want her found.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.791
Think I can get these poacher bots

14:19.833 --> 14:21.333
up and running to hunt her scent.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.958
Do it. Find the traitorous whelp.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.875
Apprentice, get to work.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.083
Why aren't you afraid of magic

14:36.125 --> 14:37.458
like the rest of your people?

14:37.500 --> 14:40.916
To be clear, the cats don't like magic.

14:40.958 --> 14:42.750
Why let yourself get captured?

14:44.166 --> 14:46.041
You wouldn't understand.

14:46.083 --> 14:49.250
Oh, because I'm from the jungle and you're from the city?

14:49.291 --> 14:52.291
Believe me, you're from the city.

14:53.625 --> 14:54.833
I am?

14:54.875 --> 14:56.541
Yeah, your accent sounds like

14:56.583 --> 14:59.500
you were born into an upper family.

14:59.541 --> 15:00.958
Just count your lucky stars you're out here

15:01.000 --> 15:03.416
and not back in the house that Randor built.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.250
You don't like the king?

15:05.291 --> 15:07.083
No one likes the king,

15:07.125 --> 15:08.625
especially at street level...

15:08.666 --> 15:12.125
or below street level, which is where I usually am.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.666
Randor won't do anything about all the poaching out here,

15:14.708 --> 15:17.125
so he's no friend of the tribe's either.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.000
And now that we're done bonding,

15:20.041 --> 15:21.458
shouldn't you be getting back to doing

15:21.500 --> 15:24.250
whatever the voice in your head told you to?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.250
Like I said... you wouldn't understand.

15:34.125 --> 15:34.916
Try me.

15:42.208 --> 15:45.000
That isn't jealousy I smell... ...is it?

15:45.041 --> 15:46.875
Oh, of course not.

15:46.916 --> 15:48.500
Adam's like a brother to me.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.875
I'm just worried he's gonna leave.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.166
Some flashy magic wielder showing up

15:53.208 --> 15:54.958
isn't gonna help anything.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.458
And it's a problem we can't solve

15:56.500 --> 16:00.000
by ramming it with your helmet, I assume.

16:00.041 --> 16:04.083
Every problem can be solved by ramming it with my helmet.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.708
Mm.

16:05.750 --> 16:08.708
We may have a different problem for you to ram.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.750
So the voice in my head

16:10.791 --> 16:12.916
led me here to deliver a package.

16:12.958 --> 16:14.208
To who?

16:14.250 --> 16:15.583
You don't happen to have

16:15.625 --> 16:17.833
any champions out here, do you?

16:17.875 --> 16:19.666
Being a champion

16:19.708 --> 16:22.583
is about defending those who can't defend themselves.

16:22.625 --> 16:23.875
That was weird.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.791
Where did that come from?

16:37.583 --> 16:38.666
Are those poacher bots?

16:43.250 --> 16:44.541
Give us the Witch.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.375
Halt. Do not move.

16:50.416 --> 16:52.666
Tiger Tribe answers to no one!

17:05.875 --> 17:07.750
Technology!

17:08.750 --> 17:10.583
I need to protect the village.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.958
We'll find the girl and the sword

17:23.000 --> 17:24.416
once everyone's dead.

17:24.458 --> 17:27.791
Duncan, have the robots burn the village.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.791
No, no, no, I--

17:29.833 --> 17:31.083
I can't do that.

17:34.916 --> 17:35.958
Coward.

17:44.833 --> 17:46.208
I'll run out first.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.958
Then you get this as far from here

17:48.000 --> 17:49.333
as quickly as you can.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.250
Hide it.

17:54.458 --> 17:57.875
If I survive, my voice and I will come back for it.

17:58.958 --> 18:01.083
We need water! Please--

18:02.458 --> 18:04.666
Fire! We need to save the village!

18:06.208 --> 18:07.333
Capture.

18:09.125 --> 18:12.416
Ah, thank you, kind stranger.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.458
Talking tiger!

18:15.958 --> 18:17.250
Whoa! Flying child!

18:22.125 --> 18:23.791
Krass, stand down.

18:23.833 --> 18:24.791
He saved me.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.791
Hey, Evelyn.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.875
There she is.

18:49.708 --> 18:52.791
They don't get to attack us and run without a fight.

18:52.833 --> 18:54.125
Come on, Cringer.

18:58.041 --> 19:00.291
Intercept. Capture.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.625
Contain.

19:01.666 --> 19:03.291
Do not run.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.041
Stop.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.791
Error.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.208
Et subvertam eos!

19:14.250 --> 19:16.958
Et subvertam eos!

19:17.000 --> 19:20.208
Et subvertam eos!

19:27.041 --> 19:28.333
Whoa!

19:30.333 --> 19:32.458
Hang on. I've got you.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.791
Don't worry. This is my favorite cliff.

19:34.833 --> 19:36.750
I almost die here all the time.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.291
I told you to get away from here.

19:54.166 --> 19:57.791
Get the real sword out of here.

19:57.833 --> 20:01.208
I had a sword this whole time?

20:06.125 --> 20:08.416
Hand it over, thief.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.041
You want this?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.208
Come and get it.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.333
"By the Power of Grayskull,

20:27.375 --> 20:29.458
I have the Power"?

20:50.916 --> 20:54.875
I have the Power!

20:58.166 --> 21:00.750
-What? -No!

21:05.166 --> 21:08.416
What? He's... a man.

21:20.416 --> 21:23.791
The Power of Grayskull.

21:23.833 --> 21:26.083
Will never be yours!

21:45.166 --> 21:47.875
The Power of Grayskull...

21:50.041 --> 21:54.291
...belongs to me!
