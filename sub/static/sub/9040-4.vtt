WEBVTT

00:02.433 --> 00:04.600
- ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

00:04.600 --> 00:07.067
YOU GOT AMY ON HOLD,
YOU GOT STEFANIA IN ITALY,

00:07.067 --> 00:09.900
AND NOW YOU'RE DATING
JOANNE AGAIN?

00:09.900 --> 00:11.500
- NO DATING, OKAY?

00:11.500 --> 00:14.800
JUST TALKING ON THE PHONE,
YOU KNOW, LIKE FRIENDS.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.133
- FRIENDS.

00:16.133 --> 00:19.400
THE WOMAN THREW AN ASHTRAY
AT YOUR HEAD.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.533
- IT'S CALLED PASSION,
RAYMOND.

00:22.533 --> 00:23.633
BUT WHO KNOWS?

00:23.633 --> 00:24.900
THERE MIGHT STILL BE
SOME SPARKS THERE.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.167
- THEN SOMEONE SHOULD THROW

00:26.167 --> 00:28.967
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER
AT YOUR HEAD.

00:28.967 --> 00:31.433
- JOANNE HAS CHANGED A LOT,
OKAY?

00:31.433 --> 00:34.033
SHE'S NOT
LIKE SHE USED TO BE.

00:34.033 --> 00:37.500
THREE WOMEN. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

00:37.500 --> 00:43.400
- YOU DO A DANCE,
YOU GIGANTIC LUCKY BASTARD.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.300
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.067
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE
THREE WOMEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:48.067 --> 00:51.067
- HEY, WE ALL LOST MONEY
ON THAT BET.

00:59.467 --> 01:02.367
- [gasps]
YOU DREW THAT YOURSELF?

01:05.633 --> 01:06.833
- THEY'RE COMING!

01:06.833 --> 01:10.267
[Beethoven's "Ode to Joy"]

01:30.933 --> 01:32.600
[music stops]

01:32.600 --> 01:36.200
[heart beating]

01:39.267 --> 01:42.167
["Ode to Joy" resumes]

01:44.533 --> 01:47.233
- YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN TELL
WHICH ONE IS THE RIGHT BROAD?

01:47.233 --> 01:48.433
- LOOK, IT'S ALL RIGHT, DAD.

01:48.433 --> 01:51.300
- SHUT UP.
IT'S SIMPLE.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.800
WHICH LADY IS GOING
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU,

01:53.800 --> 01:54.933
COOK FOR YOU,

01:54.933 --> 01:57.333
LET YOU HAVE
THE GOOD PILLOW?

01:57.333 --> 01:58.800
- DAD, YOU'RE 100.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.800
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE
MORE THAN ONE GOOD PILLOW?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.567
- IT'S THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

02:04.567 --> 02:07.267
WHICH ONE IS GOING
TO LAUGH AT YOUR JOKES?

02:07.267 --> 02:08.667
- OH, THEY ALL DO,

02:08.667 --> 02:10.467
EXCEPT STEFANIA
DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH VERY WELL,

02:10.467 --> 02:12.100
SO I HAVE TO DO A LOT
OF HAND GESTURES,

02:12.100 --> 02:14.033
FUNNY NOISES, YOU KNOW?

02:14.033 --> 02:15.267
- WHICH ONE DOESN'T FREAK OUT

02:15.267 --> 02:18.033
WHEN THEY SEE THIS
COMING AT THEM?

02:23.800 --> 02:26.867
- HA HA, RAYMOND.

02:26.867 --> 02:31.567
- WHO'S GOT HIPS WIDE ENOUGH
TO BEAR YOUR ENORMOUS CHILDREN?

02:39.367 --> 02:42.100
- WELL, THAT WOULD BE AMY,
BUT DON'T TELL HER.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.700
- YOU KNOW, WITH AMY,

02:44.700 --> 02:46.567
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
SHE'S EVER HAD SEX WITH,

02:46.567 --> 02:48.833
SO TECHNICALLY,
YOU CAN'T DISAPPOINT HER.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.467
- TRUE.

02:50.467 --> 02:54.167
- ADD IT UP.
AMY IS YOUR WINNER.

02:54.167 --> 02:58.033
- WELL, WE DID USED TO TALK
ABOUT HAVING KIDS,

02:58.033 --> 02:59.633
AND SHE'S ALWAYS
STUCK BY ME,

02:59.633 --> 03:02.967
AND, WELL,
WE DO MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY.

03:02.967 --> 03:04.933
IT'S AS IF WE'RE...

03:04.933 --> 03:08.933
MEANT TO BE, ISN'T IT?

03:08.933 --> 03:10.633
- YEAH, MAYBE.
WHAT DO I KNOW?

03:10.633 --> 03:11.967
- ALL RIGHT, AMY.

03:11.967 --> 03:13.700
THAT'S IT. YES, IT'S AMY.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:13.700 --> 03:15.500
WE'RE GOING TO START FRESH
WITH A CLEAN SLATE.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.933
I'M GOING TO TELL HER
ABOUT JOANNE AND STEFANIA.

03:17.933 --> 03:19.433
- WHAT?

03:19.433 --> 03:22.167
- I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
ANY SECRETS.

03:22.167 --> 03:24.633
- WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

03:24.633 --> 03:27.700
YOU NEVER
TELL A WOMAN ANYTHING.

03:27.700 --> 03:31.567
EVEN IF THEY FIGURE IT OUT,
YOU DENY.

03:31.567 --> 03:34.033
- BUT AMY WOULD WANT ME
TO BE HONEST.

03:34.033 --> 03:35.433
- YEAH, THAT'S
HOW THEY GET YOU.

03:35.433 --> 03:36.800
YOU THINK
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT,

03:36.800 --> 03:41.067
AND THEN YOU
CANNOT BELIEVE THE YELLING.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.600
- YEAH,
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

03:42.600 --> 03:47.167
42 YEARS OF "FOR GOD'S SAKES,
CLOSE YOUR ROBE"?

03:53.633 --> 03:57.100
- HEY...

03:57.100 --> 03:58.333
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.967
I'LL--I'LL TELL
MY GIRLFRIEND

03:59.967 --> 04:01.533
ABOUT MY OTHER GIRLFRIENDS.

04:01.533 --> 04:05.167
- [imitating Robert]
HEY, YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

04:05.167 --> 04:07.900
HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.233
[both chuckling]

04:10.233 --> 04:13.300
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK,

04:13.300 --> 04:15.500
YOU GOT THREE WOMEN
AFTER YOU, HUH?

04:15.500 --> 04:19.367
LET ME--
LET ME CHECK OVER HERE.

04:19.367 --> 04:22.767
YOU GOT THREE WOMEN AFTER YOU,
HUH, HUH?

04:22.767 --> 04:24.167
THEN WHO DOES?

04:24.167 --> 04:27.433
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
I BELIEVE THAT'S ME.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.967
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT,
GENTLEMEN.

04:30.967 --> 04:33.700
AND NOW...
ADIEU.

04:43.100 --> 04:46.033
- WHAT WAS THAT FACE YOU DID?

04:50.467 --> 04:54.333
POOR DEBRA.

04:54.333 --> 04:58.433
- NO POOR DEBRA.
I'M--I'M DOING A FACE, DAD.

04:58.433 --> 05:01.567
- ARE YOU DOING A FACE
RIGHT NOW?

05:05.133 --> 05:06.200
- NO.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.467
- POOR DEBRA.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.300
- THE PIZZA
WAS TO YOUR LIKING?

05:15.300 --> 05:17.200
- MMM. IT WAS PERFECT.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.867
- NO, YOU'RE PERFECT.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.400
OW!

05:21.400 --> 05:22.867
- OH, ROBERT,
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:22.867 --> 05:24.600
HERE.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.867
- YEAH, THANKS, THANKS.
I'M FINE.

05:27.867 --> 05:30.300
- WHO'S BURNING FUR?

05:35.367 --> 05:39.267
- LISTEN, AMY,
I THINK WE'RE GOOD TOGETHER.

05:39.267 --> 05:41.467
DON'T YOU?

05:41.467 --> 05:42.600
- YES.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.033
- I MEAN,
WE MAKE A GOOD COUPLE, RIGHT?

05:46.033 --> 05:48.733
- YES.

05:48.733 --> 05:50.167
- THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU

05:50.167 --> 05:54.100
ABOUT US BEING TOGETHER.

05:54.100 --> 05:57.100
- I'M LISTENING.

05:57.100 --> 06:00.733
- I THINK THAT YOU AND I
ARE MEANT TO BE.

06:02.367 --> 06:03.400
AND THAT'S WHY
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME

06:03.400 --> 06:05.533
TO TELL YOU ABOUT JOANNE.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.300
- JOANNE?

06:10.300 --> 06:11.700
- YEAH, WELL, WE'VE SPOKEN,

06:11.700 --> 06:13.567
AND I THINK SHE WANTS
TO GET BACK TOGETHER,

06:13.567 --> 06:15.033
AND, HONESTLY,
FOR A WHILE,

06:15.033 --> 06:16.300
I WASN'T SURE WHAT I WANTED,

06:16.300 --> 06:17.767
BUT I'VE DECIDED

06:17.767 --> 06:22.000
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
I WANT TO BE WITH.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.233
- YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
TO JOANNE

06:23.233 --> 06:26.200
ABOUT GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.400
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN TALKING,

06:27.400 --> 06:29.167
AND--AND I'VE BEEN THINKING.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.367
- YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
TO JOANNE

06:31.367 --> 06:34.133
ABOUT GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

06:34.133 --> 06:36.100
FOR HOW LONG...

06:36.100 --> 06:39.167
SWEETIE?

06:43.200 --> 06:44.800
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.433
BEFORE ITALY, BUT, SEE,
THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING YOU,

06:46.433 --> 06:48.200
BECAUSE I WANT
TO BE TOTALLY HONEST

06:48.200 --> 06:52.200
BECAUSE I FEEL
THAT WE ARE MEANT TO BE.

06:53.700 --> 06:57.533
- MEANT TO BE.

06:57.533 --> 07:00.200
- DON'T YOU?

07:00.200 --> 07:03.333
- LET ME SEE.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.033
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING

07:05.033 --> 07:07.200
WITH YOUR EX-WIFE
FOR OVER A MONTH

07:07.200 --> 07:08.700
BEHIND MY BACK,
AND THEN--

07:08.700 --> 07:10.433
- WELL, YEAH, BUT, SEE,
Y-YOU'RE NOT FOCUSING

07:10.433 --> 07:13.333
ON THE POSITIVE PART
OF THE STORY.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.067
- OH, BUT I AM, ROBERT.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.633
I'M HAPPY.

07:16.633 --> 07:19.900
I MEAN, THIS IS
ALL SUCH WONDERFUL NEWS.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.967
YOU'VE BEEN DECEITFUL,

07:21.967 --> 07:24.167
AND YOU'RE SETTLING FOR ME,

07:24.167 --> 07:25.833
BUT, HEY,

07:25.833 --> 07:29.667
BEFORE I GET REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY HAPPY,

07:29.667 --> 07:33.900
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH ME?

07:33.900 --> 07:36.033
- NO.

07:40.933 --> 07:42.633
- WELL, GOOD,

07:42.633 --> 07:44.767
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
I COULD GET MUCH HAPPIER.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.133
- WELL, BUT I JUST--

07:46.133 --> 07:51.300
- AND THANK YOU
FOR ANOTHER FABULOUS EVENING.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.467
TONIGHT
I'M TAKING THE LEFTOVERS.

07:53.467 --> 07:55.167
I'LL BE
IN THE OFFICE TOMORROW

07:55.167 --> 07:57.500
IF ANYBODY WANTS
TO SEND ME FLOWERS.

08:01.400 --> 08:05.300
- PERHAPS WE SHOULD
CANCEL THE SPUMONI.

08:16.933 --> 08:19.400
- [sighs]

08:21.900 --> 08:23.133
- HOW'S THE MEATLOAF?

08:23.133 --> 08:25.267
- IT'S GOOD.
IT'S VERY GOOD.

08:28.167 --> 08:31.100
- YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW--
YOUR BROTHER--

08:31.100 --> 08:33.633
HE'S A CHILD.

08:33.633 --> 08:36.233
DO MEN EVER
STOP BEING STUPID?

08:41.733 --> 08:45.400
- NO, THEY DON'T...

08:45.400 --> 08:48.367
AND YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HOLD ON TO YOUR PIZZA.

08:48.367 --> 08:51.000
- OH, I DON'T CARE.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.967
- ROBERT TOLD YOU?

08:57.967 --> 08:59.433
- YOU KNEW?
- I'M SORRY.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.733
- HE'S HORRIBLE,
AND HE EXPECTS ME TO BE GRATEFUL

09:01.733 --> 09:03.167
BECAUSE HE TOLD ME
WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.767
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

09:04.767 --> 09:06.833
- HE'S ACTING LIKE HE HAS
NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

09:06.833 --> 09:08.433
- I KNOW, AND JUST BECAUSE
HE WAS ON VACATION,

09:08.433 --> 09:11.933
THAT IS NO EXCUSE.
- VACATION?

09:11.933 --> 09:13.767
HE TOOK JOANNE ON VACATION?

09:13.767 --> 09:15.067
- NO, NO, NO, STEFANIA.

09:15.067 --> 09:17.200
- WHO?

09:24.100 --> 09:26.833
- WH-WHAT?

09:26.833 --> 09:28.400
- WHO'S STEFANIA?

09:28.400 --> 09:31.400
- WAIT, WHO'S WHO?
WAIT, WHAT NAME DID YOU SAY?

09:33.867 --> 09:35.033
OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK AT THAT.

09:35.033 --> 09:39.567
YOUR HAIR
LOOKS SO GOOD THAT WAY.

09:39.567 --> 09:42.333
- SO THERE WAS JUST
THE TWO SLICES?

09:47.333 --> 09:50.033
- DOESN'T AMY'S HAIR
LOOK GOOD?

09:50.033 --> 09:52.567
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.833
- OH, GOOD, AMY.
YOU'RE HERE.

09:57.833 --> 10:00.233
I-I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR OFFICE ADDRESS.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.333
- WHO THE HELL
IS STEFANIA?

10:05.033 --> 10:08.000
- UH, UH, UH...

10:08.000 --> 10:11.633
- SOUNDS LIKE A GIRL'S NAME.
A GIRL YOU MET IN ITALY?

10:12.867 --> 10:15.200
- UH...

10:15.200 --> 10:19.167
- WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH HER IN ITALY?

10:22.267 --> 10:24.700
- VERY LITTLE.

10:36.933 --> 10:39.067
I'M SORRY.

10:47.333 --> 10:51.633
- I SAVED MYSELF FOR YOU.

10:51.633 --> 10:55.967
- REALLY SORRY.

10:55.967 --> 10:58.733
- GOOD-BYE, ROBERT.

10:58.733 --> 10:59.800
- BUT WE'RE...

10:59.800 --> 11:03.567
MEANT TO BE.

11:05.567 --> 11:08.033
- WHEN SHE GOT UP ON THE COUCH
THE SECOND TIME,

11:08.033 --> 11:10.567
WHAT DID YOU THINK
SHE WAS GOING TO DO?

11:21.567 --> 11:24.600
OH, MAN,
SHE REALLY NAILED YOU.

11:24.600 --> 11:29.033
WAS SHE--
WAS SHE WEARING A RING?

11:29.033 --> 11:32.733
- OUR FRIENDSHIP RING.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.000
- IRONIC.

11:37.233 --> 11:40.200
- COULD I GET SOME
FROZEN BABY PEAS, DEB?

11:40.200 --> 11:43.300
- YOU KNOW WHAT, ROBERT?
YOU GET YOUR OWN DAMN PEAS.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.333
- WELL, WHY ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
WHAT DID I DO?

11:46.333 --> 11:48.233
- [laughs]
WHAT DID YOU DO?

11:48.233 --> 11:49.633
- HEY, LOOK,
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD AMY

11:49.633 --> 11:51.267
ABOUT STEFANIA
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:51.267 --> 11:53.400
YOU SHOULD BE
APOLOGIZING TO ME.

12:11.433 --> 12:13.100
- AND WHAT
YOU SHOULD'VE DONE

12:13.100 --> 12:15.667
IS TELL AMY THE TRUTH
ABOUT EVERYTHING,

12:15.667 --> 12:20.533
OR BETTER YET, NOT BE
SUCH A PIG IN THE FIRST PLACE!

12:20.533 --> 12:25.167
- THAT'S THE WORST APOLOGY
I'VE EVER GOTTEN.

12:25.167 --> 12:26.967
- WHY WOULD YOU GET INVOLVED
WITH SOMEONE ELSE

12:26.967 --> 12:28.500
WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP?

12:28.500 --> 12:30.133
WHAT, DOES JUGGLING
THREE WOMEN AT A TIME

12:30.133 --> 12:32.667
MAKE YOU COOL?

12:37.133 --> 12:39.700
- UNCOOL.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.200
- YOU KNOW,
IF THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
THAT YOU CAN
BUILD YOUR SELF-ESTEEM,

12:42.200 --> 12:43.600
THEN YOU ARE PATHETIC,

12:43.600 --> 12:45.067
AND YOU DON'T DESERVE
TO BE WITH ANYONE.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.200
- YEAH, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.267
- WHAT WAS THAT?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.733
- LAY DOWN. PLAY DEAD.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.567
- WE ALL KNOW ABOUT YOU,
OKAY, DEB?

13:02.567 --> 13:04.800
YOU WERE POPULAR.
YOU JUGGLED GUYS ALL THE TIME.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.000
HOW MANY GUYS ASKED YOU
TO YOUR SENIOR PROM, HUH?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.500
FIVE? SIX?

13:08.500 --> 13:10.267
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO I TOOK TO MY PROM?

13:10.267 --> 13:12.900
OUR COUSIN NELLIE.

13:12.900 --> 13:16.100
- HE THREW UP ON HER.

13:16.100 --> 13:19.967
- SOMEBODY SPIKED THE PUNCH!

13:19.967 --> 13:23.267
- OKAY, WELL, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR COUSIN,

13:23.267 --> 13:26.100
BUT THAT WAS HIGH SCHOOL.
I GREW UP.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.767
I REALIZED THAT
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS

13:27.767 --> 13:30.867
IS HAVING SOMEONE
THAT UNDERSTANDS ME,

13:30.867 --> 13:32.167
THAT'LL BE THERE FOR ME,

13:32.167 --> 13:33.700
SOMEBODY THAT I WANT
TO GROW OLD WITH.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.133
GET OFF OF ME!

13:44.367 --> 13:46.800
I THOUGHT THAT YOU
FELT THAT WAY ABOUT AMY.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.500
- WELL, I DID. I DO.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.233
- THEN WHY WOULD YOU
FOOL AROUND WITH STEFANIA?

13:51.233 --> 13:54.033
- HAVE YOU SEEN STEFANIA?

14:03.867 --> 14:05.933
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, ROBERT?

14:05.933 --> 14:07.833
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT ONE
OF THOSE SLIMEBALLS

14:07.833 --> 14:10.867
WHO'S ONLY INTERESTED
IN SCORING WITH CHICKS.

14:10.867 --> 14:13.867
- I COULD BE.

14:13.867 --> 14:15.567
- NO, YOU COULDN'T,

14:15.567 --> 14:18.700
OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED
TWO YEARS FOR AMY TO BE READY.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.033
I-I JUST DON'T GET YOU.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.667
YOU WERE IN
A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP

14:21.667 --> 14:24.100
WITH SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU,
AND YOU BLEW IT.

14:30.033 --> 14:31.833
- HONESTY.

14:31.833 --> 14:34.133
DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.967
- I JUST SAW AMY.
SHE'S CRYING.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.533
DID YOU BREAK UP AGAIN?

14:42.533 --> 14:44.700
- YEAH, AND I THINK
IT'S FOR GOOD THIS TIME, MA.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.300
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BE FINE.

14:46.300 --> 14:50.700
- YOU'LL BE FINE?
WHAT ABOUT ME?

14:50.700 --> 14:53.167
AMY WAS GOING TO GIVE ME
MORE GRANDCHILDREN!

14:53.167 --> 14:55.400
AND THERE WAS TALK
OF A GUESTHOUSE,

14:55.400 --> 14:57.467
AND I COULD LEAVE YOUR FATHER
IF I WANTED!

14:57.467 --> 15:00.100
- STOP IT!
- OH, STOP!

15:00.100 --> 15:01.467
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.767
I CAN'T.

15:02.767 --> 15:07.467
DO YOU WANT TO KILL ME?
BECAUSE YOU'RE KILLING ME.

15:07.467 --> 15:09.367
- SORRY.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.767
- GOOD.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.767
NOW PICK UP THIS PHONE
AND TELL THAT TO AMY.

15:12.767 --> 15:15.733
- NO, MA,
I CAN'T CALL HER NOW.

15:15.733 --> 15:19.133
- WELL, I COULD SEE HOW
THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE AWKWARD.

15:19.133 --> 15:21.833
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.267
- NO, STOP IT, MA!

15:24.267 --> 15:26.533
JUST STOP IT!

15:26.533 --> 15:29.067
I BLEW IT. IT'S OVER.
SHE'LL NEVER TAKE ME BACK.

15:29.067 --> 15:30.167
- NO, WE ARE NOT GIVING UP.

15:30.167 --> 15:31.433
WE COULD STILL WORK THIS OUT.

15:31.433 --> 15:32.800
- WILL YOU LET IT GO,
ALL RIGHT?

15:32.800 --> 15:37.433
IT'S MY LIFE!
I'LL DO WHAT I WANT!

15:38.900 --> 15:41.400
- WHO'S BEEN TELLING HIM
IT'S HIS LIFE?

15:45.700 --> 15:47.233
- YOU READY TO ORDER?

15:47.233 --> 15:49.233
- UH, ACTUALLY,
I'M WAITING FOR SOMEBODY.

15:49.233 --> 15:51.367
NO, THANKS.
NO FIRE TONIGHT.

15:57.233 --> 15:58.533
- HI, BOBBY.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.900
- HI, JOANNE.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.233
- I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

16:02.233 --> 16:03.967
ONE OF MY CLIENTS
HAD A FENDER-BENDER.

16:03.967 --> 16:06.167
I HAD TO GO HOLD HIS HAND.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.200
- WOW. INSURANCE.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.433
IT'S LIKE POLICE WORK,
YOU KNOW?

16:10.433 --> 16:12.167
YOU'RE ALWAYS ON CALL,

16:12.167 --> 16:14.400
EXCEPT THEY DON'T
SHOOT AT YOU.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.300
- ONLY WHEN THEY FIND OUT
HOW LITTLE WE PAY.

16:18.300 --> 16:22.000
- HEE HEE HEE HEE.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.533
- BOBBY, RELAX.

16:24.533 --> 16:26.900
IT'S JUST ME.
- I KNOW.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.533
IT'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW?

16:28.533 --> 16:33.233
IT'S LIKE I KNOW YOU
BUT LIKE I DON'T KNOW YOU.

16:33.233 --> 16:36.433
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

16:36.433 --> 16:38.667
- I'M SO GLAD YOU WANTED
TO HAVE DINNER TONIGHT.

16:38.667 --> 16:43.300
I THINK WE'VE BOTH BEEN
THINKING THE SAME THING.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.467
- I THINK MAYBE WE HAVE.

16:45.467 --> 16:48.367
- ROBERT, YOU KNOW HOW I AM.

16:48.367 --> 16:51.033
I SEE WHAT I WANT
AND I GO FOR IT,

16:51.033 --> 16:54.733
AND WHAT I WANT IS YOU.

16:56.700 --> 16:57.733
- YOU KNOW,

16:57.733 --> 17:00.233
WHEN WE WERE TALKING
ON THE PHONE,

17:00.233 --> 17:02.467
I WAS GETTING
THAT SAME VIBE.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.133
- WELL, YOU KNOW...

17:10.133 --> 17:12.600
YOU KNOW, BOBBY,
I'M NO SNOW WHITE.

17:12.600 --> 17:18.500
I'VE HAD MY SHARE OF DATES
AND INSURANCE CONVENTIONS.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.500
TRUTH?
YOU WERE MY BEST.

17:21.500 --> 17:25.267
- WELL, THANK YOU.
RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

17:25.267 --> 17:28.067
- OOH, THAT HEAT.
CAN YOU FEEL IT?

17:28.067 --> 17:30.433
- PIZZA OVEN.
- BOBBY.

17:30.433 --> 17:34.000
- OH, YES, YES.
I FEEL THE OTHER HEAT.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.133
- WE NEED TO BE TOGETHER.

17:38.133 --> 17:40.100
- WELL, I'D LIKE THAT.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.967
MAYBE WE'RE...

17:41.967 --> 17:45.267
MEANT TO BE.

17:45.267 --> 17:48.700
- YES, WE ARE.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.100
- SO, HEY, YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE MOVIES LATER?

17:51.100 --> 17:53.300
- WHAT?
- OH, I KNOW, MINIATURE GOLF.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.533
I KNOW THIS GREAT COURSE

17:54.533 --> 17:55.867
THAT LOOKS OVER
LONG ISLAND SOUND.

17:55.867 --> 17:59.933
- [laughing]

17:59.933 --> 18:01.500
- WHAT, WHAT?
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

18:01.500 --> 18:04.833
- YOU, I FORGOT HOW FUNNY
YOU COULD BE.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.400
MINIATURE GOLF.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.933
WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN,
BOBBY,

18:07.933 --> 18:11.667
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
MINIATURE ABOUT IT.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.433
- BUT REGULAR GOLF
TAKES SO LONG.

18:20.900 --> 18:26.400
- I DON'T WANT ANY OF
THAT OTHER STUFF, BOBBY.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.633
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
I WANT FROM YOU.

18:30.633 --> 18:32.400
- AAH!

18:32.400 --> 18:34.967
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO STARTLE YOU.
THAT'S JUST MY FOOT.

18:34.967 --> 18:36.767
- OH, YOUR FOOT.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.067
IT'S THIS DIVE, YOU KNOW?

18:38.067 --> 18:40.033
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S CRAWLING AROUND.

18:40.033 --> 18:42.500
AAH! PONY!

18:47.033 --> 18:48.567
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

18:48.567 --> 18:52.400
- I THINK YOUR FOOT
SPAKS FOR ITSELF, YES.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.033
BUT WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
SOMETHING MORE?

18:55.033 --> 18:58.267
- LIKE WHAT?
- A RELATIONSHIP.

18:58.267 --> 18:59.867
- A PIZZA AND HOT SEX?

18:59.867 --> 19:02.733
MOST GUYS WOULD CONSIDER THAT
THE PERFECT RELATIONSHIP.

19:02.733 --> 19:04.533
- WELL,
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S BAD.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.533
I JUST THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
PART OF A BIGGER ARRANGEMENT.

19:06.533 --> 19:09.500
- UGH, LIKE OUR MARRIAGE?
WE TRIED THAT.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.800
- WELL, OKAY, I KNOW,
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.367
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE GUYS

19:13.367 --> 19:15.333
WHO'S ONLY INTERESTED
IN SCORING WITH CHICKS.

19:15.333 --> 19:18.633
- OH, COME ON.
LET'S JUST HAVE SOME FUN.

19:18.633 --> 19:21.367
I SAW THAT VANILLA PUDDING
YOU WERE DATING, EMILY.

19:21.367 --> 19:24.900
- AMY.
- AMY.

19:24.900 --> 19:28.200
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
SHE DID ANYTHING FOR YOU.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.567
- WELL, NOW,
THAT IS NONE OF YOUR--AAH!

19:30.567 --> 19:34.733
STOP IT, STOP IT,
STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT!

19:39.033 --> 19:40.833
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

19:40.833 --> 19:43.467
- YES, I AM SERIOUS.

19:43.467 --> 19:47.600
NOW KINDLY
REMOVE YOUR FOOT.

19:49.733 --> 19:51.800
- FINE.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.733
OKAY, THEN.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.967
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

19:55.967 --> 19:59.400
- WELL, WAIT, WHAT'S THAT?
YOU'RE LEAVING?

19:59.400 --> 20:02.367
- I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU
UNLESS YOU NEED INSURANCE.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.867
- THEN OKAY TO YOU!

20:07.867 --> 20:09.200
THAT'S RIGHT,

20:09.200 --> 20:10.867
AND LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE.

20:10.867 --> 20:12.967
ROBERT BARONE
IS NOT AVAILABLE

20:12.967 --> 20:15.100
FOR A BOOTY CALL!

20:19.867 --> 20:22.000
YOU HEARD ME.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.733
HELLO, AMY, IT--

20:38.067 --> 20:40.200
LOOK, AMY,
DON'T HANG UP.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.367
AMY, DON'T HANG UP.
IT'S ROBERT.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.067
OKAY, LISTEN, I SCREWED UP.

21:01.067 --> 21:03.167
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.033
COULD I JUST COME OVER?

21:05.033 --> 21:07.733
O-O-OKAY,
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.167
THANKS, MA.

21:16.933 --> 21:19.333
HELLO? HELLO?

21:19.333 --> 21:23.800
DON'T HANG UP.
IT'S ROBERT.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.733
IS STEFANIA THERE?

21:27.800 --> 21:30.267
- CREPA.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.433
- NO MORE LONG DISTANCE.

21:46.733 --> 21:48.167
COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

21:48.167 --> 21:51.133
YOU COULD'VE ENDED UP
WITH ONE OF THEM.
