WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.655
- Previously on "The Flash"...
I'm Cisco, by the way.

00:03.699 --> 00:05.048
You must be Gypsy.
It's nice to meet you.

00:05.092 --> 00:06.049
Who are you?

00:06.093 --> 00:08.051
- Daddy?

00:08.095 --> 00:09.270
- You're a warrior
who would fight to protect

00:09.313 --> 00:10.532
the only person I love.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.534
- I want to take the cure.

00:12.577 --> 00:16.059
- You're the person that I want
to run this team when I'm gone.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.235
- Sorry I went
all ice dagger-y on you.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.454
I still don't like you.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.064
Ramsey, don't do this.

00:21.108 --> 00:24.763
- As long as I feed,
I could live forever.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.380
- So this is where
you've been hiding.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.646
- Sometimes the truth

00:37.689 --> 00:40.692
is the hardest lie
to see through.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.869
And when you can't put
your faith in the truth...

00:43.913 --> 00:47.699
all you have left is yourself.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.267
- You're under arrest, Ramon.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.369
- Barry,
we don't have to do this.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.284
- It's Tahiti,
not Iron Heights.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.243
- I know, but we've got
too much going on right now

01:09.286 --> 01:10.461
to be taking a vacation.

01:10.505 --> 01:11.723
- Okay, look.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.117
It's two days.
All right?

01:14.161 --> 01:16.337
Ramsey's been off the grid
for two weeks.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.382
And Crisis is coming.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.254
No matter what.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.169
Let me take you
someplace special,

01:22.212 --> 01:24.736
where we can have
fruity umbrella drinks

01:24.780 --> 01:27.130
and get sand between our toes.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.305
- I do like us.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.396
And we're even better
with Mai Tais.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.051
- You gotta take a look.
It's in a book.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.273
Hey, I thought you guys
fathwoomed out of here.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.970
- We just wanted to make sure
you guys were okay

01:41.013 --> 01:42.537
holding down the fort
while we were gone.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.582
- We're good.
Rest easy, lovebirds.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.193
Team Leader
is my new middle name.

01:46.236 --> 01:47.194
- What was it before?

01:47.237 --> 01:48.325
- Baracus.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.371
- As in Barracas, Argentina?

01:50.414 --> 01:53.069
- No, as in Mr. T.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.810
My mom was a big "A-Team" fan.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.028
- Wish mine was.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.029
Could've been Hannibal Dibny.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.292
- Hannibal?

01:58.335 --> 02:00.032
Please. You're Murdock
on your best day.

02:00.076 --> 02:01.512
You guys have fun.

02:01.556 --> 02:02.992
I'm gonna hold it down

02:03.035 --> 02:04.036
with a little help
from my friend,

02:04.080 --> 02:05.168
the Barry.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.822
- The Barry?
I'm standing right here.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.432
- Not you, Barry.

02:08.476 --> 02:10.173
B.A.R.I.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.349
Barry Allen
Replicated Intelligence.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.003
- Aww.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.222
- It's my decision-making
algorithm.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.745
- So if there's a problem,

02:16.788 --> 02:18.616
this is gonna tell us
what to do?

02:18.660 --> 02:21.750
- Yes, and since it's based
on his past leadership choices,

02:21.793 --> 02:23.665
it'll tell me
how to handle any situation

02:23.708 --> 02:25.623
exactly like he would.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.582
- I mean, I'm flattered,
I think.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.454
- Huh.
What is Barry's favorite thing

02:30.498 --> 02:32.195
that I make him for breakfast?

02:32.239 --> 02:33.196
- Uh...

02:33.240 --> 02:34.241
banana?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.681
- Huh.
- Who's next?

02:39.724 --> 02:43.119
- Okay, computer,
what's Barry's favorite movie?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.207
- "Empire."

02:48.255 --> 02:50.039
- Oh, thank God.

02:50.082 --> 02:52.041
- Actually...

02:52.084 --> 02:54.261
I mean, I've loved,
loved "Empire Strikes Back"

02:54.304 --> 02:56.219
my whole life, but...

02:56.263 --> 02:58.352
now that I think about it...

02:58.395 --> 02:59.875
oh, my God.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.790
My favorite movie
is "Jurassic Park."

03:01.833 --> 03:03.705
- There it is.
- How does it do that?

03:03.748 --> 03:06.403
- Fuzzy logic,
and AI intuition, my guy.

03:06.447 --> 03:10.364
With the B.A.R.I. by my side,
it'll be like you never left.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.453
- Well, okay.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.281
I guess we should get going.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.630
- Yes, we should.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.240
- Send me a post card.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.461
- Look, remember,
I'm leaving you in charge.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.419
- I'll see you
when you get back.

03:22.463 --> 03:23.507
- Bye.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.208
- So you got
any marching orders, boss?

03:29.992 --> 03:32.603
- The B.A.R.I. wants me
to stay here

03:32.647 --> 03:35.258
and you to go with Frost
to stake out Ramsey's lab.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.348
- I love it when a plan
comes together.

03:50.099 --> 03:52.319
- Just so you know...

03:52.362 --> 03:54.364
I let you follow me here.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.148
- I let you think that.

03:59.674 --> 04:02.329
Captain Joe West.
CCPD.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.069
- So...

04:04.113 --> 04:05.854
what brings you down here?

04:05.897 --> 04:09.423
- People with your face
usually have something to hide,

04:09.466 --> 04:12.556
so when my son Barry told me
that there was a new Wells,

04:12.600 --> 04:15.690
I started keeping tabs on you.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.083
- I don't know how new
a Wells I am, and second,

04:18.127 --> 04:19.868
keeping tabs, that's what
you mean by spying on me

04:19.911 --> 04:22.349
from that nondescript sedan
parked up on Lake Avenue?

04:22.392 --> 04:25.961
- Well-observed.
So why are you...

04:26.004 --> 04:29.138
digging holes in the city?

04:29.181 --> 04:32.489
- Well, perfect stranger...

04:32.533 --> 04:35.100
the reason I'm digging holes
underneath the city is--

04:35.144 --> 04:36.493
oh, wait...

04:36.537 --> 04:37.712
you couldn't
possibly understand.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.888
- Try me.
- Nah.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.498
No, no, no, no, no.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.465
- You need some rest.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.205
All those late nights
working on the B.A.R.I.,

04:53.249 --> 04:54.511
you've barely slept this week.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.600
- Tonight,
I'm gonna sleep like a child

04:56.644 --> 04:58.559
'cause I got the B.A.R.I.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.212
and I got my white noise

05:00.256 --> 05:01.866
and I got my boo.

05:04.652 --> 05:05.740
Goodnight.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.540
- You okay?

05:23.584 --> 05:25.412
- No, not really.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.588
I just almost went
Sweeney Todd on myself.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.636
Why would I do that?

05:32.680 --> 05:34.508
Maybe I was sleepwalking?

05:34.551 --> 05:37.467
- Yeah,
that's kind of your new thing.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.729
- Huh?

05:38.773 --> 05:41.036
- Yeah, you woke me up
last night, too.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.255
I heard the front door shut,
and you were standing there

05:43.299 --> 05:45.562
with your keys in your hand
and your shoes on.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.521
I was half-asleep,
so I just put you back to bed.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.392
- Okay,
why didn't you say anything?

05:49.436 --> 05:50.828
- Well, I didn't think
it was a big deal.

05:50.872 --> 05:53.570
I--just like a one-off,
'cause you're so exhausted.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.180
- Well, it is a big deal,

05:55.224 --> 05:56.834
and it's not a one-off anymore,
is it?

05:56.878 --> 05:58.488
That's twice now
that's happened.

05:58.532 --> 05:59.794
- Babe, relax.

05:59.837 --> 06:02.187
Okay, you just launched
the B.A.R.I. today.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.799
You need time to rest
that sexy brain of yours.

06:04.842 --> 06:07.671
- My brain is the Ryan Gosling
of genius intellects.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.630
Okay.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.022
Will you please let me know
next time that happens?

06:11.066 --> 06:12.459
- Yes.

06:12.502 --> 06:13.721
- And hide
those scissors from me.

06:15.505 --> 06:16.811
Okay.
- Goodnight, babe.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.682
Goodnight.

06:18.726 --> 06:22.556
I love y--I look...

06:22.599 --> 06:26.560
forward to spending time
with you tomorrow.

06:28.518 --> 06:31.739
- Uh...thank you.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.220
- You're welcome.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.488
- Yeah, okay, babe.
Goodnight.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.497
Oh, my God.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.859
- It's okay.
I know him.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.644
He's my ex's dad.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.341
Hey, Breacher...

07:09.385 --> 07:12.170
long time no try to kill me.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.651
What brings you
to my bedroom...

07:14.695 --> 07:15.696
again?

07:19.961 --> 07:21.876
Breacher?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.487
Hey.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.490
Josh.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.714
- It's Cynthia.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.498
She's dead.

07:45.595 --> 07:48.729
- I can't believe she's gone.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.514
And I never get
to see her again.

07:51.558 --> 07:54.996
- Cynthia was tracking
a high-level hacker.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.130
Goes by the name of...

07:59.174 --> 08:00.567
Echo.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.308
- She mentioned him before.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.614
Nobody's ever been able
to figure out

08:04.658 --> 08:05.702
who he really is, right?

08:05.746 --> 08:08.531
- We think Cynthia did.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.360
How he got the jump on her,
we don't know.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.927
- I don't see her
losing a fight to anyone.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.670
- She won the fight.

08:16.713 --> 08:19.716
Dying here just...

08:19.760 --> 08:22.719
triggered her Collector QT-net.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.591
- The quara-temporal
containment barrier?

08:26.462 --> 08:28.203
Gypsy once said
these barriers

08:28.246 --> 08:29.900
were like supersized
vibe fields

08:29.944 --> 08:31.380
around the planet.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.164
The Collectors put them up
so a suspect

08:33.208 --> 08:34.775
can't breach their way
to another world.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.733
- And only the Agency
can lift it.

08:36.777 --> 08:39.606
- Meaning her killer
is still here.

08:39.649 --> 08:42.434
- I'm going to avenge
Cynthia's death.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.569
And Vibe
is gonna help me do it.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.488
- Cisco isn't Vibe anymore.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.577
He decided to take
the meta-human cure.

08:54.621 --> 08:57.711
- Weren't you worried
about breach psychosis?

08:57.754 --> 09:00.975
It happens sometimes
when you suppress your powers.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.498
It's...

09:02.542 --> 09:04.282
it's really gnarly.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.414
- How gnarly?

09:07.416 --> 09:09.418
- Hallucinations,

09:09.461 --> 09:11.028
weird blackouts...

09:11.072 --> 09:12.813
dry mouth.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.598
- My powers weren't suppressed.
They're gone.

09:15.642 --> 09:16.991
- Well,
even without his meta-powers,

09:17.034 --> 09:18.732
Cisco can still help you.

09:18.775 --> 09:19.994
He's a genius.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.654
- What would Barry do?

09:33.660 --> 09:36.358
The B.A.R.I. wants us
to go to the crime scene.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.014
Listen, you don't
have to go back there.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.668
I'll go.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.539
- I'll come with you.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.544
- Kamilla,
this could be dangerous.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.633
I mean, we're dealing
with a killer here.

09:50.677 --> 09:51.852
I can't ask you
come to with me.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.854
- You didn't.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.029
I volunteered.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.646
- I knew you wouldn't
let me down.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.664
- Okay.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.065
You can dance around
with that thing all you want.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.458
This place is a dead zone long
before that wall came down.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.025
- Well,
it might eventually go through.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.810
At least I'm trying to help.
What are you doing?

10:36.853 --> 10:37.854
- I'm getting us out of here.
That's what I'm doing.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.900
Stupid.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.858
- Well, I have a team that
could help us get out of here.

10:41.902 --> 10:42.729
- How?

10:42.772 --> 10:43.860
How are they gonna help us?

10:43.904 --> 10:45.079
No one knows we're down here.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.776
- I am a precinct captain.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.866
I have dozens of cops
and a whole support staff

10:49.910 --> 10:51.302
that depends on me 24/7.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.564
If I don't show up
for a couple of hours,

10:52.608 --> 10:53.565
they're coming looking for me.

10:53.609 --> 10:54.741
- All right.

10:54.784 --> 10:55.916
Somebody's over-confident.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.134
You know what you don't have?

10:57.178 --> 10:58.135
You don't have
cell phone service.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.702
You don't have Wi-Fi.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.182
You have no way
of telling anyone--

11:01.225 --> 11:02.749
- What are you doing?
- That we're down here.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.185
Right?
- Put it away.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.490
- This is our only option.

11:05.534 --> 11:06.491
I'm gonna get us out of here.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.492
- What are you doing?

11:07.536 --> 11:08.711
Stop!

11:16.937 --> 11:19.809
both: What is wrong with you?

11:19.853 --> 11:21.289
- Why did you not tell me

11:21.332 --> 11:22.856
that this Earth vibrational
frequency

11:22.899 --> 11:24.814
is calibrated
at a molecular level?

11:24.858 --> 11:25.815
- You're supposed to be
the expert.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.382
- Shh!

11:27.425 --> 11:29.166
- Shush me one more time.
We gonna have a problem.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.212
- We already do.

11:31.255 --> 11:35.825
It turns out that
that fireball sapped 80...

11:35.869 --> 11:38.959
87% of the oxygen
in this chamber,

11:39.002 --> 11:43.354
which means that you and I have
42 minutes left to breathe.

11:58.805 --> 11:59.762
- You know,
the idea was you'd call me

11:59.806 --> 12:02.417
before he started
killing people.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.680
- He showed up out of nowhere.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.770
Rat and Pops
tried to run for it.

12:07.814 --> 12:08.989
They didn't get far.

12:09.946 --> 12:13.602
Frost,
that guy is next-level creepy.

12:13.645 --> 12:16.953
I wouldn't go looking for him.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.608
- Smart move.

12:19.651 --> 12:20.870
Especially without a partner.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.438
How's business, Snake-shack?

12:26.006 --> 12:28.269
- Had better days.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.792
- You mind giving us a minute?

12:29.836 --> 12:32.055
Need to have
a little chat with Frosty.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.975
- What are you doing here?

12:39.019 --> 12:40.411
- Looking for you.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.196
What happened
to staking out Ramsey's lab?

12:42.239 --> 12:44.024
- Norvock texted me.
He said he saw Ramsey here.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.069
- Frost, as your life coach,
going after Ramsey alone

12:46.113 --> 12:47.897
is probably gonna put me
out of a job.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.464
- This isn't a joke.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.422
This is a fight.
My fight.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.510
So stay out of it.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.382
- We're a team.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.862
Your fights are my fights,

12:55.905 --> 12:57.080
so why don't you
just take a breath

12:57.124 --> 12:59.213
and try trusting a friend?

12:59.256 --> 13:01.998
- I knew from day one
not to trust this guy.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.043
But we did.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.914
And now people are dead.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.916
So I've gotta fix this.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.397
- It wasn't that long ago
that I felt the same.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.921
Blamed myself,
never asked anyone for help,

13:11.965 --> 13:13.401
and you know where it got me?

13:13.444 --> 13:16.883
Eyeball-deep
in Gingold and self-pity.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.102
So believe me when I say
that life is better

13:19.146 --> 13:20.974
if you have faith
in the people around you.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.328
What?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.374
- I know who Ramsey
has faith in.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.900
I gotta go.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.118
- Did you hear
anything I just said?

13:35.162 --> 13:36.424
You can't go alone.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.295
- I know what I'm doing.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.123
And don't worry.
I won't be alone.

13:51.613 --> 13:54.094
- Listen, Kamilla...

13:54.137 --> 13:56.792
there's something I've been
wanting to say to you.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.054
I've been trying to figure out
how to say it,

13:58.098 --> 14:00.709
but I don't know.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.930
I think I should just
come right out and say it.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.019
Kamilla, I--
- Holy crap.

14:13.765 --> 14:17.073
I thought CCPD's crime scenes
were serious.

14:17.117 --> 14:20.120
- Yep.
Earth-19 Collector agents

14:20.163 --> 14:23.688
take investigations
to a whole other level.

14:23.732 --> 14:26.126
- Agent Zak Zeal.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.911
Kamilla Hwang,
Cisco Ramon.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.522
Yeah, I heard you'd be coming.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.568
I thought you'd be taller.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.918
You know, from the way
Gypsy talked about you.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.920
- That's funny.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.139
She never mentioned you at all.

14:39.182 --> 14:41.750
-  Hi.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.795
Make sure Walker
is updating

14:43.839 --> 14:46.711
the dimensional output report.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.278
Thanks. You gotta keep
on them constantly

14:48.322 --> 14:49.932
when you're in charge.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.542
Breacher understands.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.109
Where is he, anyway?

14:53.153 --> 14:54.719
- He already saw everything
he needed to see.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.634
We're here in his place.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.159
- Well, the Agency authorized
you to join this investigation,

14:59.202 --> 15:02.205
so I guess I'll just
have to let you.

15:02.249 --> 15:05.426
- Is there a time of death?

15:05.469 --> 15:08.124
- Due to multi-dimensional
signal speed,

15:08.168 --> 15:10.039
our best guess is that
it happened some time

15:10.083 --> 15:12.041
between 2:30 and 4:30 a.m.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.174
- That's a pretty good guess.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.175
- Yeah, I know.

15:16.698 --> 15:17.786
And we found this.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.225
301-H energy cartridge.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.097
Standard issue.
No prints.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.099
Combine it
with the Sigma Baryon residue

15:26.142 --> 15:29.058
we also found,
and it looks like--

15:29.102 --> 15:32.105
- Echo killed Gypsy with
a transonic-demolecularizer?

15:32.148 --> 15:34.672
Show us.

15:34.716 --> 15:35.804
Now.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.548
- Her body, clothes,

15:40.591 --> 15:43.333
even her communicator
were all vaporized.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.608
- Me being like this...

15:57.652 --> 16:01.743
I don't want you to think
I'm still hung up over Cynthia,

16:01.786 --> 16:03.049
or something.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.833
- Cisco.

16:04.876 --> 16:07.792
Someone you cared about died.

16:07.836 --> 16:09.751
I'd be worried
if you weren't sad.

16:16.453 --> 16:20.980
So earlier,
when we first got here...

16:21.023 --> 16:23.721
you were gonna say something?

16:33.296 --> 16:34.645
- Kamilla...

16:34.689 --> 16:35.820
- We're locking down the area.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.258
- For the love of God.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.476
- You two need to leave.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.356
Ramon.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.797
- I just wanted to say again
how much I truly admired Gypsy.

16:57.233 --> 17:00.106
I've got some big shoes
to fill.

17:06.416 --> 17:09.289
- We're not seriously just
gonna give up, are we?

17:09.332 --> 17:12.118
- No, we're not.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.815
Have you noticed
he's the only one who benefits

17:13.858 --> 17:15.425
from Cynthia's death?

17:15.469 --> 17:17.036
- So what's the plan?

17:18.472 --> 17:21.170
- The B.A.R.I. suggests
a dual course of action.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.780
First,
we use the satellites to track

17:22.824 --> 17:24.217
the weapon's unique signature.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.219
Can you...
- On it.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.481
I've been paying attention.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.396
Second?

17:29.439 --> 17:32.747
- We're gonna have to do
the impossible.

17:44.498 --> 17:47.892
- Man, sit down.
Relax.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.155
We may live longer.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.156
- What evidence
do you have that anyone,

17:50.199 --> 17:52.201
literally anyone,

17:52.245 --> 17:55.117
is coming down here
to rescue us?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.118
- I don't have any.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.815
- No?

17:57.859 --> 17:58.860
- But I do have faith.

17:58.903 --> 18:01.602
- Ha! Well, then, Captain,

18:01.645 --> 18:03.604
at least you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.084
Whoa.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.219
Ouch.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.829
- Uh-huh.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.354
Got light-headed, didn't you?

18:14.397 --> 18:15.224
- No.

18:17.139 --> 18:21.448
- You selfishly don't believe
in anything or anybody.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.669
I used to be like that.

18:25.713 --> 18:30.848
When my ex-wife
left me and my daughter...

18:30.892 --> 18:32.720
I was broken.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.680
So much so
that I went somewhere

18:36.724 --> 18:38.900
where I almost never go.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.728
Church.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.251
I didn't go there
to pray or anything.

18:42.295 --> 18:43.252
I went there
to yell at the universe

18:43.296 --> 18:45.341
for destroying my life.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.518
Next thing,
I'm at home.

18:49.824 --> 18:52.479
I'm so hurt
that I can't even...

18:52.522 --> 18:55.264
cook dinner for my...

18:55.308 --> 18:57.701
for my daughter.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.486
Doorbell rings.

18:59.529 --> 19:04.186
I open the door to what looked
like my whole neighborhood

19:04.230 --> 19:05.927
standing on my lawn

19:05.970 --> 19:07.755
who had cooked food for us.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.329
You can have faith
in anything, but...

19:16.372 --> 19:19.375
it was then
I realized that I...

19:21.856 --> 19:23.988
I have faith in people.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.217
- According to B.A.R.I.,

19:35.261 --> 19:37.350
we can use low-level
delta wave vibrations

19:37.393 --> 19:40.309
to stimulate harmonic resonance
in my prefrontal cortex.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.485
If I think of memories
with Cynthia,

19:42.529 --> 19:45.575
we'll be absorb
the residual vibe energy

19:45.619 --> 19:47.795
from the object
that killed her.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.189
- Can this machine
restore my vibe powers?

19:50.232 --> 19:52.408
- No, we're not the generators
of the vibe,

19:52.452 --> 19:55.281
but we will be
the receptors of it.

19:55.324 --> 19:59.023
- But I'm gonna have to see
Cynthia die, won't I?

20:05.595 --> 20:10.818
- It's the only way we have
of finding out who killed her.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.428
My white noise machine

20:12.472 --> 20:16.258
will stimulate
our delta-wave patterns.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.564
Add the shell casing
as a trigger,

20:17.607 --> 20:19.218
and that'll do it.

20:21.394 --> 20:25.528
B.A.R.I., initiate artificial
vibrational sequence.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.100
If we want this to work,

20:32.143 --> 20:33.623
we have to make
physical contact.

21:54.574 --> 21:55.662
- You murdered my daughter.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.359
- No.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.969
No, I didn't do it.

22:00.406 --> 22:01.711
Liar!
- You have to believe me!

22:01.755 --> 22:02.799
- Leave him alone!

22:04.235 --> 22:05.889
- Where did you get that?

22:05.933 --> 22:08.327
- In Cisco's workshop.
I don't know how it got there.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.458
- I do.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.678
He just murdered
my daughter with it.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.375
- No. Breacher.

22:13.419 --> 22:14.507
I don't care what
you think you saw, okay?

22:14.550 --> 22:15.769
You know Cisco.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.118
You know how much
he cared about Gypsy.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.554
There's gotta be
another explanation.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.382
- Babe, please.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.557
- What about doppelgangers?

22:21.601 --> 22:23.080
- She's right.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.518
There's thousands of other
versions of me out there.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.476
- Yeah, and they're
all pencil-pushers.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.523
None of them are scientists
like you!

22:30.566 --> 22:31.959
You had motive,

22:32.002 --> 22:34.396
and just enough guts
to do this.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.572
- Breacher, I swear.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.618
I don't know
how this is possible.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.624
Unless...

22:46.452 --> 22:48.236
- Unless breach psychosis.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.502
- Kamilla,
what time did you find me

22:53.546 --> 22:56.418
sleepwalking the other night?

22:56.462 --> 22:58.942
- I don't know.
Maybe 4:00 a.m.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.383
You're guilty.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.736
But you're not
in your right mind.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.565
I didn't just lose
a daughter today.

23:12.608 --> 23:14.784
I lost a son.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.657
Because...

23:17.700 --> 23:21.574
I still respect
the man you were.

23:21.617 --> 23:25.621
Now I'm gonna give you an hour

23:25.665 --> 23:28.015
to get
all your affairs in order,

23:28.058 --> 23:30.974
and then turn yourself in.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.672
Or I will end you.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.824
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.959
- I'm gonna blow
this blockade sky high.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.047
- You do that,
this whole thing collapses,

24:00.090 --> 24:01.614
we're dead.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.833
- I do nothing,
and we're dead anyway.

24:03.877 --> 24:06.662
- We still have time
for my team to show up.

24:06.706 --> 24:11.188
- Enough.
Enough about your team and you.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.669
- You know where I stand.

24:13.713 --> 24:15.758
- How can you have such faith?

24:15.802 --> 24:21.242
- Because someone
or something called The Monitor

24:21.285 --> 24:25.072
says my son is destined to die
in some kind of Crisis,

24:25.115 --> 24:27.727
and the only way
I can stomach any of that

24:27.770 --> 24:30.686
is have faith
that his continuing life

24:30.730 --> 24:35.212
or his death
is for the greater...

24:35.256 --> 24:36.518
the greater...

24:36.562 --> 24:39.695
the greater good.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.567
- You've seen Mar Novu?

24:45.396 --> 24:46.963
Captain.

24:49.836 --> 24:50.880
Captain.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.560
- Hey. Hey.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.388
I got you, big guy.
You're all right.

25:22.912 --> 25:25.959
- Oh, you got my text.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.526
- No.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.875
I called CCPD
with a Ramsey update,

25:28.918 --> 25:29.876
and nobody had seen you.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.355
Ran your plates,

25:31.399 --> 25:32.792
tracked your car
to a block from here.

25:32.835 --> 25:35.664
Your notes
had this tunnel marked.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.580
I'm guessing...

25:38.624 --> 25:39.625
because of him.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.544
- Lone Ranger.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.545
- Hi.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.698
- I see you got my message.

26:12.396 --> 26:13.484
Cait.

26:17.184 --> 26:20.796
You know, it's a bit weird
seeing you like this.

26:22.972 --> 26:26.846
- I guess both our looks
are evolving.

26:26.889 --> 26:29.457
Yes, I did get your message.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.416
It reminded me of when we both
used to work for your mom.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.680
Way back when I was a resident.

26:34.723 --> 26:37.465
- You were like the daughter
Mum never had.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.772
Do you know
at first I was jealous?

26:39.815 --> 26:43.427
Over time, I came to see you
less as a rival

26:43.471 --> 26:45.604
and more like a sister.

26:45.647 --> 26:50.652
And that's why I'm offering
you a chance to join me.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.741
- You want to kill me, too.

26:52.785 --> 26:55.614
- I'm offering you life, Cait.

27:02.795 --> 27:07.756
I've learned to control it,
discovered its secret beauty.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.890
This my final masterpiece,
Cait.

27:12.892 --> 27:15.764
Life eternal.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.070
- Immortality?

27:18.767 --> 27:20.769
- You see?

27:20.813 --> 27:22.466
I'm no monster.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.729
I'm a miracle.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.731
- You're talking
about reversing nature.

27:25.774 --> 27:28.255
- Nature never meant
for us to fly,

27:28.298 --> 27:30.213
and yet
we've touched the stars,

27:30.257 --> 27:32.781
and not by being slaves
to the shackles

27:32.825 --> 27:34.653
of the natural order,

27:34.696 --> 27:37.917
but by transcending them.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.397
Take a look
at your own life, Cait.

27:40.441 --> 27:43.531
How many times have you had
to say good-bye to people?

27:43.574 --> 27:47.883
How many more have you not
even had the chance to do so?

27:47.927 --> 27:49.842
My mum should be here.

27:49.885 --> 27:52.453
Your father should be here.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.110
Your husband should be here.

27:59.286 --> 28:00.722
Join me,

28:00.766 --> 28:02.855
and this is the end
of good-byes.

28:02.898 --> 28:06.510
No one you love
will ever die again.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.818
- I've seen
your version of life.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.996
It's a nightmare,

28:14.040 --> 28:16.869
but you can still be
your mother's son.

28:16.912 --> 28:20.786
She had so much faith in you,
and so do I.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.918
You just need
to have faith in yourself.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.710
- Your words are madness.

28:40.370 --> 28:43.722
Next time won't be a choice.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.863
- Look,
we have to face the facts.

28:54.907 --> 28:57.170
And I have to own up
to whatever it is that I did.

28:57.213 --> 28:58.867
- You're gonna turn
yourself in?

28:58.911 --> 29:02.305
- I have to.
I can't trust myself anymore.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.829
- Anymore?

29:03.872 --> 29:05.874
You stopped trusting
yourself the moment

29:05.918 --> 29:08.007
Barry asked you to take over
as team leader.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.138
I mean, you built
this elaborate device

29:09.182 --> 29:10.270
just so you wouldn't have
to make

29:10.313 --> 29:11.271
any decisions for yourself.

29:11.314 --> 29:12.794
- That's...

29:12.838 --> 29:14.535
- Let me make
this decision for you.

29:14.578 --> 29:15.623
You are innocent.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.670
- How can you be so sure?

29:20.933 --> 29:22.369
- Because I have faith in you.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.374
The real question is why don't
you have any faith in yourself?

29:27.417 --> 29:30.116
- Because Barry's gonna die.

29:30.159 --> 29:32.771
What if I can't keep people
safe the way he does?

29:41.388 --> 29:42.345
I'm not the Flash.

29:42.389 --> 29:43.433
- Babe.

29:45.392 --> 29:48.177
Barry didn't choose you
to be the Flash.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.049
He chose you to be you.

29:56.577 --> 29:59.667
All these doubts,
they aren't you.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.452
They're just noise
in your head.

30:16.640 --> 30:20.993
- It's been in Wi-Fi mode
this whole time.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.822
- What is it?

30:23.865 --> 30:24.997
- This code.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.476
It's turned
my white noise machine

30:26.520 --> 30:28.827
into a micro neural
impulse disruptor

30:28.870 --> 30:29.915
that could go
all "Wreck-It-Ralph"

30:29.958 --> 30:31.612
on my brainwaves.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.570
It might even look
like breach psychosis.

30:33.614 --> 30:36.008
- Who'd be smart enough
to code like that?

30:36.051 --> 30:37.096
- Me.

30:45.234 --> 30:49.891
- Sometimes the truth is
the hardest lie to see through.

30:49.935 --> 30:53.852
When you can't put
your faith in the truth...

30:53.895 --> 30:56.724
all you have left is yourself.

30:56.767 --> 30:59.031
- You're under arrest, Ramon.

31:03.905 --> 31:04.906
- I surrender.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.043
I'm guilty.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.914
- Suspect is in custody.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.524
Initiate QT-net removal

31:14.568 --> 31:16.918
so the prisoner
can be transferred to Earth-19.

31:16.962 --> 31:17.919
- Copy that.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.660
- Breacher.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.531
That holo-cube will tell you
everything you need to know

31:21.575 --> 31:23.882
about what happened to Cynthia.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.058
- QT-net is off.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.929
- QT-net's down, sir.

31:29.235 --> 31:30.889
I'll cuff him.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.947
- Sorry it had to go down
this way...

31:45.991 --> 31:48.515
but I needed you
to lift the net.

31:48.558 --> 31:49.951
- Re-engage the QT-net.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.344
- That'll take four minutes.

31:51.387 --> 31:52.519
- I don't care
if it'll take four minutes.

31:52.562 --> 31:53.520
Just get on with it!

31:59.178 --> 32:01.745
I hate force fields.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.312
- I know.
- Cisco.

32:03.356 --> 32:06.359
You think I'm gonna let the man

32:06.402 --> 32:09.231
that murdered
my daughter escape?

32:09.275 --> 32:11.016
- No, sir.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.931
And neither am I.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.114
I'm here.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.813
There's no sign of him.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.206
- His breach portal energy
puts him

32:27.249 --> 32:28.947
at the east end
of the warehouse.

32:33.603 --> 32:34.953
- Game over, Echo.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.346
- Oh, no.
You found me.

32:37.390 --> 32:39.044
How did you find me?

32:39.087 --> 32:41.960
- I tricked the Collectors
into lifting the QT-net.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.310
When they did,
I knew you'd jump at the chance

32:44.353 --> 32:47.269
to get out of here
and try to open a breach.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.141
I just had to track
the portal energy.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.577
- Babe,
just get him back here

32:50.620 --> 32:52.274
so the agents
can take him down.

32:52.318 --> 32:53.710
- You have approximately
two minutes

32:53.754 --> 32:55.974
before my ride out of here
boots up.

32:56.017 --> 32:59.020
I go bye-bye,
and you take my place

32:59.064 --> 33:01.153
in Earth-19 Collector jail,

33:01.196 --> 33:03.546
but you're the one
with the gun.

33:03.590 --> 33:06.245
So...

33:06.288 --> 33:08.160
do you have it in you
to stop me?

33:11.076 --> 33:12.860
- I guess we'll find out,
won't we?

33:14.557 --> 33:16.777
- You are an anomaly.

33:19.214 --> 33:23.740
Makes me wonder why
it was so easy to frame you.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.177
Don't you want to know
how I did it?

33:25.220 --> 33:27.570
You might learn something.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.224
- No, I pretty much
figured it all out.

33:29.268 --> 33:31.400
After you got here,
you killed the top agent

33:31.444 --> 33:33.054
in the Collective,

33:33.098 --> 33:35.187
but you still needed a way out.

33:35.230 --> 33:37.319
So you used your face
to get into S.T.A.R. Labs

33:37.363 --> 33:39.017
and plant this gun
in my workshop.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.153
Is that right?

33:45.197 --> 33:47.025
- So far, so good.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.027
- But hacking
my white noise machine

33:49.070 --> 33:50.593
to make me sleepwalk...

33:54.075 --> 33:56.904
That's when you tipped
your hand.

33:56.947 --> 33:59.472
I'd recognize
that coding anywhere.

33:59.515 --> 34:02.127
And since didn't hack it,

34:02.170 --> 34:04.694
I knew it had to be
some other version of me.

34:04.738 --> 34:07.871
- I'm not just
some other version of you.

34:07.915 --> 34:10.178
I specialize in hacking

34:10.222 --> 34:14.095
multiversal databases
to create new identities.

34:14.139 --> 34:17.577
I could change your world...

34:17.620 --> 34:19.231
in an instant.

34:19.274 --> 34:23.278
You see, somewhere out there
is a Cisco Ramon

34:23.322 --> 34:25.715
who isn't as lucky as you are,

34:25.759 --> 34:27.500
who doesn't have the job,

34:27.543 --> 34:32.113
the mind,
the life you have.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.333
But if the price is right,

34:34.376 --> 34:37.162
Echo can reverse
those fortunes.

34:39.207 --> 34:40.904
And you might just wake up
tomorrow

34:40.948 --> 34:42.297
living someone else's life.

34:42.341 --> 34:43.907
- Is that why you killed her,

34:43.951 --> 34:45.257
so you could keep peddling

34:45.300 --> 34:47.302
these fake identities
to people?

34:47.346 --> 34:50.349
- I didn't kill Gypsy.

34:50.392 --> 34:51.959
You did.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.833
I'll give her this.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.618
She was a formidable fighter.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.229
But not even the smartest guy
in the room could beat her

35:01.273 --> 35:04.667
in hand-to-hand combat,
but it didn't matter.

35:04.711 --> 35:07.453
Even though she'd
been chasing me for years,

35:07.496 --> 35:11.152
she never even knew
what I looked like.

35:11.196 --> 35:15.287
So when she caught me,
and she saw my face,

35:15.330 --> 35:19.334
all it took was one moment,
one moment of her flinching,

35:19.378 --> 35:22.990
and that gave me the second
I needed to use that gun,

35:23.033 --> 35:25.427
the same gun that's
in your hands right now.

35:25.471 --> 35:29.083
Do you need me to spell it out
for you, genius?

35:29.127 --> 35:35.307
Gypsy is dead
because when she saw me,

35:35.350 --> 35:36.351
she saw you.

35:36.395 --> 35:38.092
- Stop talking.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.226
- She didn't have to die.
She couldn't let me go.

35:41.269 --> 35:44.229
She breached me to this Earth
and I vaporized her.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.882
- No.

35:45.926 --> 35:47.754
- Yes.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.090
Don't feel bad, Cisco.

36:22.571 --> 36:25.052
You're just not wired like me.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.191
- You're right.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.062
I'm a hell of a lot smarter.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.327
I programmed
that weapon to trigger

36:39.371 --> 36:41.329
an anti-vibrational force field

36:41.373 --> 36:44.202
around whoever fires it.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.769
In this case...

36:46.813 --> 36:48.206
that's you, genius.

36:55.691 --> 36:57.432
Did you get
my holo-cube message?

37:01.044 --> 37:03.221
Took you long enough.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.323
- Echo is in an Earth-19 cell.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.499
Where he belongs.

37:20.542 --> 37:24.329
I'm sorry I lost faith in you,
Cisky.

37:24.372 --> 37:25.678
- You know what?

37:25.721 --> 37:27.984
It's okay.

37:28.028 --> 37:31.466
Things were looking
pretty bad there for a second.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.382
But what I don't get,
if she was dying,

37:34.426 --> 37:35.731
why come here?

37:41.389 --> 37:43.217
- Because she knew

37:43.261 --> 37:47.134
you would bring Echo
to justice.

37:47.177 --> 37:50.355
She had to lure him here,
to this Earth.

37:53.053 --> 37:55.882
- She never lost faith
in you, Cisco.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.586
- Now that this is over with,

38:04.630 --> 38:06.327
what am I gonna do?

38:06.371 --> 38:09.417
- Same thing I have to do.

38:09.461 --> 38:12.290
We start healing.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.466
- I want to invite you to...

38:14.509 --> 38:17.033
Cynthia's remembrance ceremony

38:17.077 --> 38:18.470
on Earth-19.

38:20.733 --> 38:23.039
You, too.

38:23.083 --> 38:25.477
- I'd be honored.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.869
- Cynthia would've liked you.

38:29.568 --> 38:32.310
I do, too.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.094
- What's not to love?

38:38.185 --> 38:39.839
- Awkward.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.060
I have to go now.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.549
- Well, uh, yeah.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.769
I, um...

38:56.812 --> 38:59.075
Well, we haven't...said it.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.990
- Yeah, I know.

39:01.034 --> 39:05.299
- So...yeah, I, um...

39:08.346 --> 39:10.739
- Me too.
Big-time.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.306
- Oh, thank God.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.490
- Please tell me
you went home at some point.

39:22.534 --> 39:25.188
- I knew I smelled
SPF 90.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.367
How was it?
- Amazing.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.934
15 beaches in 24 hours,

39:31.978 --> 39:33.936
one of the many perks
of marrying a speedster.

39:35.764 --> 39:39.638
Yo, Chester's energy level's
already up to 87%?

39:39.681 --> 39:41.727
- Yeah, yeah.
The, uh--

39:41.770 --> 39:43.424
the M.A.C.'s gonna be done
cooking him up

39:43.468 --> 39:44.512
any day now.

39:44.556 --> 39:47.167
- So the B.A.R.I.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.734
was a success?

39:48.777 --> 39:51.214
- Uh, actually,
I had to get rid of it.

39:51.258 --> 39:52.825
I did use it--
try to use it--

39:52.868 --> 39:55.349
at first, but...

39:55.393 --> 39:59.527
over time,
I finally realized...

39:59.571 --> 40:01.964
And you already knew
that was gonna happen.

40:02.008 --> 40:03.618
- It's just more proof

40:03.662 --> 40:04.619
that you're the right person
to lead the team.

40:04.663 --> 40:07.013
- Hmm.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.797
- Cisco, we got your message.

40:08.841 --> 40:12.018
I'm--I'm really sorry
to hear about Gypsy.

40:12.061 --> 40:15.630
- Some things
you never get over.

40:15.674 --> 40:18.372
But her service
is next week.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.679
- You want us
to come with you?

40:20.722 --> 40:21.680
- Yeah.
I mean, we loved her, too.

40:21.723 --> 40:23.072
- Thank you.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.987
Uh, Kamilla's coming
with me, so...

40:27.512 --> 40:29.165
I'm very lucky to have her.

40:32.647 --> 40:36.477
Is it wrong
to feel that way...

40:36.521 --> 40:39.828
I mean, with everything
that just happened?

40:39.872 --> 40:44.485
It's like I'm moving on,

40:44.529 --> 40:46.748
What kind of person does that?

40:46.792 --> 40:49.447
- Someone who is very much
in love.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.627
- It's funny.

40:55.670 --> 40:59.108
Cynthia wasn't the person
I ended up with,

40:59.152 --> 41:02.634
but, um,

41:02.677 --> 41:06.768
I think she taught me how to be
the person I needed to be

41:06.812 --> 41:09.641
for when the right person
came along,

41:09.684 --> 41:11.033
and for that,

41:11.077 --> 41:12.818
I will never forget her.

41:19.085 --> 41:23.306
- Your vitals are good, Joe.

41:23.350 --> 41:24.656
- You know, in all the hubbub
of saving your keisters,

41:24.699 --> 41:26.048
I never got to ask

41:26.092 --> 41:27.789
what the hell you were doing
down there.

41:27.833 --> 41:30.226
- Hey, 1940s,
no one says "keisters."

41:30.270 --> 41:31.619
- Nash, if you would just
tell us

41:31.663 --> 41:33.534
what you're looking for
down there,

41:33.578 --> 41:35.275
we might be able
to help you.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.541
- All right, tomorrow morning,
9:00, tunnels.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.325
Bring your whole fancy team.

41:42.369 --> 41:43.631
- Why should we do that?

41:43.675 --> 41:44.893
- 'Cause...

41:44.937 --> 41:46.591
I know how to save
Barry Allen.

42:15.489 --> 42:16.621
- Greg, move your head.
