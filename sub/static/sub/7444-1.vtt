00:36.981 --> 00:39.017
It's a jungle out there.

00:45.381 --> 00:46.814
# Hey!

01:00.821 --> 01:02.861
# Come on

01:02.896 --> 01:04.866
# Come on

01:04.900 --> 01:07.335
# I'm back to where I came from

01:08.821 --> 01:10.701
# Come on

01:10.736 --> 01:12.546
# Come on

01:12.581 --> 01:14.026
# I'm back to where... #

01:14.061 --> 01:15.706
Alright, everyone, this is a raid!

01:15.741 --> 01:18.494
Face down on the floor, all of you!
Jesus Christ.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.626
Jase!

01:22.661 --> 01:28.381
Hey, everyone,
this is Jase and he's all mine.

01:28.416 --> 01:30.706
Hi, Alphonse.

01:30.741 --> 01:34.097
Hello, Taylor. Looking delicious.

01:35.301 --> 01:39.026
Ella? Ella?!

01:39.061 --> 01:40.540
What's this shit?

01:41.981 --> 01:44.701
Where have you been? You were
supposed to be here bloody ages ago.

01:44.736 --> 01:47.261
Oh, I love it when you get stroppy.
Yeah? How much?

01:47.296 --> 01:49.558
Oh, yes.

01:49.593 --> 01:51.821
Here we go!

01:57.621 --> 01:59.373
Mad bastard.

02:01.101 --> 02:02.659
Hands up who loves opera.

02:05.061 --> 02:07.780
Oh, good or what?
How good's that, hey?

02:09.860 --> 02:11.981
Hello, Ella.
Alphonse.

02:12.016 --> 02:13.937
Nice to see you.

02:15.941 --> 02:18.694
Thank you.
No worries.

02:22.221 --> 02:24.541
What is this?
That cost 30 bucks!

02:24.576 --> 02:27.294
Ripped off, love.

02:29.861 --> 02:32.341
As I live and breathe,

02:32.376 --> 02:34.186
Greg Workman!

02:34.221 --> 02:36.546
G'day, Alphonse. Nice threads.

02:36.581 --> 02:38.101
Didn't know you were out of Barwon.

02:38.136 --> 02:39.786
What'd you do? Jump the wall?

02:39.821 --> 02:41.986
No, got out early. Good behaviour.

02:42.021 --> 02:45.621
Didn't I invest a, uh, sum of money
into a business venture of yours?

02:45.656 --> 02:47.976
I'm gonna pay you back
as soon as I get an earner.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.621
Oh, God, Jase! Oh!

02:53.656 --> 02:56.055
Oh! Oh, God!

02:59.461 --> 03:00.906
Oh, Jase.

03:00.941 --> 03:03.341
Oh, oh, God! Oh!
You got any vodka?

03:03.376 --> 03:04.786
Alphonse wants a bloody mary.

03:04.821 --> 03:09.261
Uh, yeah. In the cupboard
under the microwave.

03:09.296 --> 03:11.461
How come we can't
do this more often?

03:11.496 --> 03:12.986
I don't know.
Oh!

03:13.021 --> 03:16.581
I better run it past my wife.
Oooh, funny bugger, aren't you?

03:30.101 --> 03:32.101
Any reason why you missed
that stop sign back there?

03:32.136 --> 03:34.899
What stop sign?
I didn't see a stop sign.

03:36.141 --> 03:37.586
That's how accidents happen.

03:37.621 --> 03:40.081
Look, I was in a rush
to the all-night chemist, OK?

03:40.116 --> 03:42.541
I've got the flu and I just
needed some cough mixture.

03:47.221 --> 03:49.541
Wanna hop out of the car for me?

03:49.576 --> 03:51.866
I'd really rather not.

03:51.901 --> 03:53.946
I'd prefer you did, Miss...

03:53.981 --> 03:58.181
...Susan Carmel Money
of Brighton Road, Elwood.

03:58.216 --> 04:00.741
Just to the back
of the vehicle, thanks.

04:05.301 --> 04:07.461
Cute. I've got a pair just like them.

04:07.496 --> 04:09.586
VKC to St Kilda...
Pig.

04:09.621 --> 04:12.741
Noise complaint,
Wando Grove. Can you attend?

04:12.776 --> 04:15.501
VKC from St Kilda 210.
We're on our way.

04:19.821 --> 04:21.732
Just try and be more
careful next time, miss.

04:23.901 --> 04:27.386
It was
a Tuesday night about 2am.

04:27.421 --> 04:31.101
Me and Steve were overdue
to take a meal break.

04:31.136 --> 04:33.066
If I knew then what I know now

04:33.101 --> 04:34.932
I probably would've gone
straight home to bed.

04:50.141 --> 04:53.301
Look, Monday -
$1,500 in full, alright?

04:53.336 --> 04:55.506
What about the interest?
What?

04:55.541 --> 04:58.026
Five grand, Monday, 9am.
Five gr...

04:58.061 --> 04:59.981
Where the fuck am I gonna
get five grand?

05:00.016 --> 05:01.866
Sell one of your kidneys,
you fat slob.

05:01.901 --> 05:04.141
I'm not gonna be able
to get five grand by Monday.

05:04.176 --> 05:06.146
I tell you what.

05:06.181 --> 05:09.306
I'll make a little deal
with you, Gregory.

05:09.341 --> 05:12.381
If you can lay a glove on me,
I'm gonna forget the whole thing.

05:12.416 --> 05:13.946
You want me to hit you?

05:13.981 --> 05:17.141
Why don't you give it
a shot, Gregory? Hey?

05:17.176 --> 05:18.986
Give it a shot.
Come on. Have a go.

05:19.021 --> 05:21.421
I don't wanna hit you.
Have a fucking go.

05:21.456 --> 05:23.821
I don't wanna hit you!
Come on! Have a go!

05:23.856 --> 05:25.861
Think of the money. Come on, come on.

05:25.896 --> 05:27.558
Whoa!

05:27.593 --> 05:29.167
Oh!

05:29.202 --> 05:30.706
Arggh!

05:30.741 --> 05:33.641
Arggh, Jesus!

05:33.676 --> 05:36.506
Get up. Get up!

05:36.541 --> 05:39.578
Come on. Come here, come here.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.258
Arggh!

05:47.261 --> 05:52.893
Oi! Oi! Enough, fellas.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.466
What's the problem?

05:55.501 --> 05:58.181
No problem. Just having a bit of fun.
Right.

05:58.216 --> 06:00.221
And you're having fun,
are you, mate?

06:00.256 --> 06:02.226
Yeah, sure. Just mucking around.

06:02.261 --> 06:04.061
There's been complaints
about the noise, fellas.

06:04.096 --> 06:05.706
It's time to kill the music.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.466
Who complained?
Never mind who it was.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.581
Just quit the world title fight,
turn the music right down, yeah?

06:10.616 --> 06:12.421
Since when has there
been a law against music?

06:12.456 --> 06:15.618
People are trying to sleep.
Just can it.

06:17.101 --> 06:19.410
You know who you're talking to?

06:21.541 --> 06:24.055
You really wanna spend
a night in the cells, do ya?

06:26.021 --> 06:27.534
Alphonse Gangitano.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.609
'Cause I don't wanna do paperwork
unless I really have to.

06:35.181 --> 06:36.666
You're gonna have to arrest me first.

06:36.701 --> 06:40.221
I can get three units down here
in five minutes, if you like.

06:40.256 --> 06:42.132
Look, we'll just turn
the music down, alright?

06:43.541 --> 06:45.054
Steve.

06:51.821 --> 06:53.777
Oi.

06:57.581 --> 06:59.386
What's your name?

06:59.421 --> 07:01.616
Senior Constable Steve Owen.

07:02.901 --> 07:04.334
I'll remember that.

07:06.181 --> 07:07.694
Good.

07:24.021 --> 07:27.241
"Forgive your enemies,
but never forget their names."

07:27.276 --> 07:30.461
I'll get your money for you, OK?
Just give me some time.

07:30.496 --> 07:31.981
You know who said that, Gregory?

07:32.016 --> 07:34.226
You?

07:34.261 --> 07:36.252
John F. Kennedy.

07:37.581 --> 07:40.778
I don't know him.
Look, are we still mates?

07:42.461 --> 07:45.338
Yeah. Yeah, mates.

07:45.373 --> 07:48.216
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:54.021 --> 07:55.932
Hey, mate!

08:01.701 --> 08:03.931
Shit. It's Alphonse.
Fuck!

08:26.661 --> 08:28.666
Greg?

08:28.701 --> 08:30.506
Oh, my God.

08:30.541 --> 08:33.421
Oh, shit. He's still breathing.

08:33.456 --> 08:34.946
Call an ambulance.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.701
What happened? What happened?
Call an ambulance!

08:36.736 --> 08:38.857
Fuck! My pants are ruined.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.756
Call a fucking ambulance!

08:40.792 --> 08:42.566
Jase, help us, please!

08:42.601 --> 08:44.306
Carl, it's me, Jase.

08:44.341 --> 08:46.861
Just put your pants on
and get to Taylor's place.

08:46.896 --> 08:50.596
Now. Now!
Alphonse, help us!

08:50.631 --> 08:54.297
Oh, God. Get away. Get up.

08:58.461 --> 09:01.241
How come you had to shoot him
so many times?

09:01.276 --> 09:03.986
See the size of the fat fuck?

09:04.021 --> 09:06.661
Anyway, it was business, alright?
The fat slob owed me money.

09:06.696 --> 09:08.461
How much?
Doesn't matter how much.

09:08.496 --> 09:11.338
It's the principle, alright?

09:11.373 --> 09:14.146
Oh, fuck. Principle. Jeez.

09:14.181 --> 09:16.546
Give me the gun.

09:16.581 --> 09:18.386
What?!
Give me the gun.

09:18.421 --> 09:20.661
Give it here. Come on.
Jase, this is my favourite gun.

09:20.696 --> 09:22.186
I'll buy you another gun.

09:22.221 --> 09:24.541
I'll get you a bigger gun.
Just give me the gun.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.541
I love this gun.
Yeah, yeah, just give me the gun.

09:30.576 --> 09:32.338
Come on. Come on!

09:38.341 --> 09:39.980
Yeah, good one, Jase.

09:40.015 --> 09:41.619
Shut up and drive.

09:49.861 --> 09:51.306
What's your name?

09:51.341 --> 09:53.466
Steve Owen. First on the scene.

09:53.501 --> 09:55.492
Right. What have we got, Steve Owen?

09:56.701 --> 09:59.021
Gregory Workman attended
a party on the premises

09:59.056 --> 10:01.341
and the killer pumped
a whole magazine into him.

10:01.376 --> 10:02.626
Witnesses?

10:02.661 --> 10:04.346
Uh, two sisters.

10:04.381 --> 10:05.826
We've got the girls inside.

10:05.861 --> 10:08.659
I've kept them separate so they
don't get together on their stories.

10:12.301 --> 10:14.178
It's like he was crazy.

10:15.381 --> 10:18.896
He just... kept shooting
till the bullets ran out.

10:20.261 --> 10:21.821
Did you witness
the actual argument?

10:21.856 --> 10:24.626
Nuh, just the murder.

10:24.661 --> 10:27.461
And he was known to you? Uh, Greg?

10:27.496 --> 10:31.981
He was a friend. Good friend.

10:32.016 --> 10:33.581
Did he have any kids?

10:33.616 --> 10:35.492
Yeah, three.

10:38.181 --> 10:41.059
Well, they just lost their dad.

10:43.421 --> 10:46.701
Now, Ella, this is a summary
of what you've told us so far.

10:46.736 --> 10:49.218
I'd like you to read it
and sign it if it's correct

10:49.253 --> 10:51.701
and in a day or so
we'll get you to St Kilda Road

10:51.736 --> 10:53.066
to make a full statement.

10:53.101 --> 10:55.461
You... you want me to, like,
testify against him?

10:55.496 --> 10:57.821
That's our best chance of getting...
No. No way.

10:57.856 --> 10:59.986
With your help,
we can put this guy away...

11:00.021 --> 11:02.381
You don't understand. He's a psycho.
He'll come after me.

11:02.416 --> 11:05.158
There are measures we can
put in place to protect you.

11:05.193 --> 11:07.901
Ella, this is your chance
to get away from these guys.

11:07.936 --> 11:10.181
Change your life.
Make a fresh start.

11:10.216 --> 11:12.746
I don't need to change my life.

11:12.781 --> 11:16.421
You know, I've got a career
at VicRoads. My life's fine.

11:16.456 --> 11:17.854
You got the wrong sister.

11:18.941 --> 11:23.661
Ella, this is
the right thing to do.

12:38.421 --> 12:40.059
Did you have a good night?

12:41.981 --> 12:44.266
Not bad. You?

12:44.301 --> 12:47.771
Hmm. Dishwasher's on the blink again.

12:49.181 --> 12:50.986
I'll check it out in the morning.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.501
Did you see the letter
about the school fees?

12:53.536 --> 12:55.537
In the morning.

13:02.101 --> 13:03.898
What were you doing in the laundry?

13:07.701 --> 13:10.738
Why did you have a shower
down in the laundry?

13:15.381 --> 13:17.497
Go back to sleep, Virginia.

13:21.661 --> 13:23.741
And that was
the beginning.

13:23.776 --> 13:25.186
Looking back,

13:25.221 --> 13:26.666
what the media called
the Gangland War

13:26.701 --> 13:30.661
started the night Alphonse Gangitano
shot Greg Workman for no good reason

13:30.696 --> 13:32.586
at a St Kilda party.

13:32.621 --> 13:34.736
It triggered a series
of chain reactions

13:34.771 --> 13:36.851
that would see almost
30 people murdered.

13:47.301 --> 13:49.321
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, mate!

13:49.356 --> 13:51.341
Oh, shout quietly, will you?

13:51.376 --> 13:53.146
Want some brekkie?

13:53.181 --> 13:55.061
I'm doing Jase a hangover special.
Nah, I'm good.

13:55.096 --> 13:57.381
Oh, darl, no.
I can't... I couldn't...

13:57.416 --> 13:59.518
Oh, you could have said so before.

13:59.553 --> 14:01.586
How are you, mate?
What's all this?

14:01.621 --> 14:06.261
Salsa di pomodoro. I made it myself.
You made it yourself, did you?

14:06.296 --> 14:07.866
Bullshit.

14:07.901 --> 14:10.941
Technically, it was Antonella's mum,
but I was official taster.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.386
Ooh! Yum!

14:12.421 --> 14:15.299
Weren't in St Kilda
last night, were you?

14:19.181 --> 14:20.853
Just gonna pop outside, darl.

14:28.061 --> 14:30.061
I had nothing to do with it.

14:30.096 --> 14:32.026
Not according to rumour.

14:32.061 --> 14:33.826
You and Alphonse,
that's the big word.

14:33.861 --> 14:36.861
No, no, just Alphonse.
He didn't need any help.

14:36.896 --> 14:38.781
Greg Workman, yeah?

14:38.816 --> 14:39.746
Yeah.

14:39.781 --> 14:41.386
Apparently owed a couple of grand.

14:41.421 --> 14:44.461
What's the point of bumping
someone who owes you money?

14:44.496 --> 14:47.501
That's not the way Alphonse's
brain works. You know that.

14:47.536 --> 14:51.061
You're too close to him.
He's my mate.

14:51.096 --> 14:53.294
Dad know?
That's why I'm here.

14:53.329 --> 14:55.493
Get dressed. We've got a meeting.

15:08.021 --> 15:10.057
No gain without pain, Craig.
Come on!

15:17.541 --> 15:19.177
How are we looking, gentlemen?

15:19.212 --> 15:20.814
Al.
Al.

15:26.901 --> 15:28.778
Yeah, it's gonna be a long season.

15:33.501 --> 15:35.306
Spot of bother last night, Al?

15:35.341 --> 15:38.701
Just a little argument that got
out of hand. Greg Workman's no loss.

15:38.736 --> 15:40.534
Probably did the world a favour.

15:40.569 --> 15:42.332
His wife and kids think that way?

15:43.781 --> 15:45.386
He insulted me, Graham.

15:45.421 --> 15:48.413
Did you find out if he had life insurance
before you bumped him, Al?

15:49.461 --> 15:51.346
It was a matter of honour.

15:51.381 --> 15:53.531
You can stick your honour
up your shiny arse, Alphonse.

15:55.661 --> 15:57.906
You fuckin' stuffed up, alright?

15:57.941 --> 16:00.661
I mean, you're bringing
the heat down on all of us.

16:00.696 --> 16:03.906
How so, Mario? Tell me.

16:03.941 --> 16:07.981
How does my personal business
impact on you and yours?

16:08.016 --> 16:10.258
Extra jacks on the street,
for starters.

16:10.293 --> 16:12.466
I had two runners
arrested this morning.

16:12.501 --> 16:15.141
They're gonna hassle anyone
who knows you, Alphonse. You watch.

16:15.176 --> 16:17.666
You're a big blip
on the radar, mate.

16:17.701 --> 16:20.781
And that's not good
for anyone's business.

16:20.816 --> 16:23.506
I apologise, Graham.

16:23.541 --> 16:26.821
Oh, come on. Sit down, sit down.

16:26.856 --> 16:28.254
Come on.

16:33.461 --> 16:39.181
Alright. I've spoken to our lawyer.
He contacted Homicide, hmm?

16:39.216 --> 16:41.934
You've got an appointment
with a Detective Butterworth.

17:05.661 --> 17:09.665
"I, Alphonse John Gangitano,

17:09.701 --> 17:12.781
"am willing to listen
to any allegations put to me

17:12.816 --> 17:16.458
"in regard to the tragic death
of Greg Workman.

17:16.492 --> 17:20.077
"But I am not prepared
to answer any questions

17:20.112 --> 17:23.661
"until after consultation
with my barrister.

17:23.695 --> 17:26.266
"I would like to take
this opportunity

17:26.300 --> 17:31.534
"to declare my total and absolute
innocence in the matter.

17:33.861 --> 17:38.741
"Signed, Alphonse John Gangitano.

17:38.776 --> 17:42.336
"14 February 1995."

17:46.581 --> 17:49.266
Here's an updated photo
for your files.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.381
Now, you can't shed any light
on the matter?

17:51.416 --> 17:55.506
How can I? I'm an innocent man.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.541
So you'd be prepared to participate
in an identification parade?

17:58.576 --> 18:00.452
You got a witness?

18:05.741 --> 18:07.857
Who?

18:11.261 --> 18:15.049
You better get your lawyer in here
'cause I'm charging you with murder.

18:23.381 --> 18:24.346
Hi.

18:24.381 --> 18:28.226
You got a booking?
No. No, we're not eating.

18:28.261 --> 18:31.461
Um, we're just looking for
a friend of ours - Taylor Randall.

18:31.496 --> 18:34.118
She didn't show up for work today.

18:34.153 --> 18:36.741
Did she tell you what she was doing?

18:36.776 --> 18:38.936
No. Did you try her mobile?

18:39.981 --> 18:42.661
Of course we tried her mobile!
What do you think we are? Stupid?

18:42.696 --> 18:44.266
Hey, hey, come on.

18:44.301 --> 18:47.381
Listen. We're just a little bit
worried about her, OK?

18:47.416 --> 18:50.258
I mean, she's not at home,
she hasn't shown up for work.

18:50.293 --> 18:53.101
Do you know if she said anything
to any of the other girls?

18:53.136 --> 18:54.746
I don't know.

18:54.781 --> 18:57.141
What's your name?
Tracey.

18:57.176 --> 18:58.626
Tracey.

18:58.661 --> 19:00.706
Tracey, you wanna do me a favour?

19:00.741 --> 19:03.381
Hey, let's get the fuck out of here.
Just give me a sec.

19:03.416 --> 19:08.011
Would you mind
asking them for me?

19:10.421 --> 19:12.013
Please?

19:20.261 --> 19:22.741
Hey.
It's all your fault, Jase.

19:22.776 --> 19:24.186
How is it my fault, huh?

19:24.221 --> 19:26.621
I wasn't the nut case
who emptied a clip into the bloke.

19:26.656 --> 19:28.941
If those bitches testify,
I go away for 10 years.

19:28.976 --> 19:30.386
10 fucking years!

19:30.421 --> 19:32.341
Come on, charges never stick
to the Black Prince.

19:32.376 --> 19:35.026
You're, um, teflon-coated.

19:35.061 --> 19:37.780
What the fuck's teflon?

19:40.301 --> 19:43.381
I thought you said they were
going to get us a proper hotel.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.826
I guess they thought this'd be safer.
It's cheaper.

19:46.861 --> 19:49.861
As soon as Alphonse Gangitano
was charged with murder,

19:49.896 --> 19:52.186
the sisters were moved
into Witness Security.

19:52.221 --> 19:56.499
Problem was, back in those days,
we didn't do WITSEC too well.

19:58.221 --> 19:59.946
What happens
after the trial?

19:59.981 --> 20:01.701
We get new identities,
I suppose.

20:01.736 --> 20:03.976
Is Mum allowed to know?

20:07.101 --> 20:08.757
For how long?

20:08.792 --> 20:10.413
Forever, I guess.

20:12.821 --> 20:14.706
Shit.

20:14.741 --> 20:16.466
Hey, look on the bright side.

20:16.501 --> 20:19.421
At least you never have to
go back to that sleazy bistro.

20:19.456 --> 20:21.506
You can find yourself
a proper job, right?

20:21.541 --> 20:23.781
You know, maybe I like
working in that sleazy bistro.

20:23.816 --> 20:25.226
Did you ever think of that?

20:25.261 --> 20:27.855
Anyway, who asked YOU
for career advice?

20:29.301 --> 20:31.181
I didn't mean for this to happen.

20:33.181 --> 20:34.746
I'm doing it!
I told you, you would.

20:34.781 --> 20:36.801
I told you
there was nothing to be scared of.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.821
Look at that.
You're as good as your sister now.

20:38.856 --> 20:40.598
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
I know, I know!

20:40.633 --> 20:42.341
Oh, there's Daddy's phone.

20:42.376 --> 20:43.786
Yeah.

20:43.821 --> 20:46.306
Yeah, that's me, yeah.

20:46.341 --> 20:48.826
You heard about my problem?

20:48.861 --> 20:50.661
Yeah, I need you
to reach some witnesses.

20:50.696 --> 20:52.666
Yeah, don't give me that.

20:52.701 --> 20:55.601
Should be a cinch for a big dick
detective like yourself.

20:55.636 --> 20:58.348
Well, get off your arse, alright,
and make a few calls.

20:58.383 --> 21:01.061
It's five grand now
and five grand when you deliver.

21:01.096 --> 21:03.106
Yeah?

21:03.141 --> 21:05.066
Yeah, well, don't fuck me.

21:05.101 --> 21:06.546
What was that?

21:06.581 --> 21:09.601
It was
probably just the wind.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.621
Did you remember to lock the door?

21:12.656 --> 21:14.826
I'm trying to sleep.

21:14.861 --> 21:16.541
Taylor, did you lock the door?
Yes!

21:16.576 --> 21:19.238
I locked the bloody door!

21:19.273 --> 21:22.067
Not that it matters.

21:22.102 --> 21:24.826
One good yank...

21:24.861 --> 21:28.381
They should've given us bodyguards.

21:28.416 --> 21:30.337
Maybe they did.

21:32.141 --> 21:33.859
Maybe they paid them off.

21:41.661 --> 21:43.626
I can't see anyone.

21:43.661 --> 21:45.586
You wouldn't, till it's too late.

21:45.621 --> 21:47.981
I am so fucking scared right now.
Where's the number?

21:48.016 --> 21:49.786
They said to only use it
in an emergency.

21:49.821 --> 21:53.181
This is a fucking emergency!
I'm packing death!

21:53.216 --> 21:55.536
Fuck!

21:59.501 --> 22:01.181
This emergency number's a dud.

22:01.216 --> 22:03.626
You know why?

22:03.661 --> 22:05.381
'Cause they knew we'd try and bail.

22:05.416 --> 22:06.906
Yeah.

22:06.941 --> 22:11.461
Hey, there's got to be, like,
a Melbourne bus, right?

22:11.496 --> 22:13.066
Or a train?
Nuh.

22:13.101 --> 22:14.546
They'll kill us if we leave.

22:14.581 --> 22:16.378
Alphonse is gonna kill us
if we stay here.

22:17.501 --> 22:18.946
I'll call Jase.

22:18.981 --> 22:21.821
His best mate?
Are you off your head? HE'LL kill us.

22:21.856 --> 22:24.146
No, not if we promise to shut up.

22:24.181 --> 22:26.536
It's the only way
we're gonna get out of here, bub.

22:32.181 --> 22:34.900
Any word from your, uh,
bent detective mate?

22:37.741 --> 22:39.801
Greedy prick takes the money,

22:39.836 --> 22:41.826
then tells me there's no way

22:41.861 --> 22:44.981
a regular cop can get access
to protected witnesses.

22:45.016 --> 22:46.821
Fuckin' dog.

22:46.856 --> 22:47.786
Shit!

22:47.821 --> 22:49.652
Where do you reckon they are?

22:51.421 --> 22:53.457
Locked up in a hotel somewhere.

22:54.901 --> 22:56.732
Here we go.

22:59.141 --> 23:00.626
Mr Gangitano.

23:00.661 --> 23:02.666
We have reason to believe

23:02.701 --> 23:04.861
that you're carrying drugs
about your person.

23:04.896 --> 23:07.181
Stand up and empty your pockets,
please.

23:07.216 --> 23:08.626
Can't you see I'm in a meeting?

23:08.661 --> 23:11.461
It wasn't a request, sir.
Do it now or I'll do it for you.

23:21.461 --> 23:23.452
Yeah.

23:24.701 --> 23:27.215
Yeah, just calm down, calm down.

23:28.621 --> 23:30.586
You see? Nothing there.

23:30.621 --> 23:32.741
But you already knew that,
didn't ya?

23:32.776 --> 23:34.626
And do I get an apology?

23:34.661 --> 23:37.129
Yeah, I'm sorry
you're such an arsehole.

23:43.141 --> 23:45.781
Oh, God, I'm sick of those tits.

23:45.816 --> 23:48.421
Oh, jealousy's a curse, bub.

23:48.456 --> 23:51.621
Na, na, na, na...

23:59.221 --> 24:00.746
Who the hell are you?

24:00.781 --> 24:03.221
Oh, it's just Carl. He's harmless.

24:03.256 --> 24:05.661
Next time knock, you dirty perve.

24:05.696 --> 24:08.334
Jason sent me.

24:29.621 --> 24:31.266
Can we trust him?

24:31.301 --> 24:33.416
What other choice have we got?

24:33.451 --> 24:35.531
What if he takes us to Alphonse?

24:51.621 --> 24:53.558
Put your hands up in the air.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.496
What's going on, Carl?
Do it.

25:26.141 --> 25:27.369
First floor.

25:30.061 --> 25:32.501
Last door
at the end of the corridor.

25:32.536 --> 25:34.651
Go on, piss off.

25:49.541 --> 25:52.266
Jase! Thank Christ...
Whoa, whoa.

25:52.301 --> 25:53.941
How come you talked
to the jacks, huh?

25:53.976 --> 25:55.506
Why did you do that?

25:55.541 --> 25:57.581
What are you, fuckin' stupid?

25:57.616 --> 25:59.586
Jason. That's not helpful.

25:59.621 --> 26:01.930
Make yourselves comfortable, please.

26:05.741 --> 26:09.861
Now, you've both made statements
to the police

26:09.896 --> 26:11.386
pertaining to certain events

26:11.421 --> 26:15.461
that took place in Wando Grove,
St Kilda, back in February.

26:15.496 --> 26:17.301
Yeah. The cops made us
sign that shit.

26:17.336 --> 26:19.318
They verballed us.

26:19.353 --> 26:21.266
Tell me the story.

26:21.301 --> 26:23.576
Where do you want to start?

26:25.781 --> 26:27.786
What's he doing here?

26:27.821 --> 26:30.221
Good to see you again, Taylor.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.826
Al, please.

26:31.861 --> 26:33.626
We don't require your presence.

26:33.661 --> 26:36.380
Can we have a moment in private
before you do this?

26:59.941 --> 27:01.386
I'm not scared of you.

27:01.421 --> 27:03.541
What's going on, Jason?

27:03.576 --> 27:06.106
Talk to me, Ella.

27:06.141 --> 27:08.538
Are you prepared
to make a new statement?

27:08.573 --> 27:10.936
Course she is.
Tell him, bub.

27:12.261 --> 27:13.819
Tell him.

27:37.021 --> 27:39.410
Thank you.

27:40.501 --> 27:41.934
But it's not good enough.

27:43.181 --> 27:44.626
What do you mean?

27:44.661 --> 27:46.777
I need you both to disappear.

27:48.581 --> 27:50.706
What do you mean?

27:50.741 --> 27:54.741
How would you both like
an all-expenses-paid trip to Europe?

27:54.776 --> 27:55.746
Hmm?

27:55.781 --> 27:58.197
You and your sister?

27:58.232 --> 28:00.613
What, like a holiday?

28:02.901 --> 28:05.574
You'd be gone for a year. Minimum.

28:07.181 --> 28:09.649
Out of reach of the jacks.

28:10.701 --> 28:12.861
Who's footing the bill?

28:12.896 --> 28:13.896
You?

28:15.941 --> 28:20.141
It's an investment
in my freedom, yeah?

28:20.176 --> 28:21.546
One catch.

28:21.581 --> 28:24.821
You have to be out of the country
by tomorrow night.

28:24.856 --> 28:27.130
Or else what?

28:30.501 --> 28:33.174
Or else you'll disappear
some other way.

28:47.701 --> 28:49.826
Gonna be OK, bub.

28:49.861 --> 28:52.614
You gotta be the luckiest chicks
in the world.

28:54.021 --> 28:55.852
Yeah, I guess.

28:58.941 --> 29:01.261
Hey, Mr G. Welcome.

29:01.296 --> 29:02.306
Hey.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.181
How's the family?
Good, Mr Wang. How are you?

29:04.216 --> 29:06.217
I reserve best table.

29:07.821 --> 29:09.254
Sit down, fellas.

29:10.941 --> 29:13.661
Couple of bottles of Bollinger,
straight up, hey?

29:13.696 --> 29:15.186
Yes, indeed.
Good man.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.026
What are we celebrating?
Nothing yet.

29:17.061 --> 29:19.341
Plane doesn't leave for an hour.

29:19.376 --> 29:20.979
Next.

29:24.541 --> 29:25.666
Hi.

29:25.701 --> 29:29.091
Off on holidays?
Sort of, yeah - working holiday.

29:35.501 --> 29:37.412
What's the problem?

29:41.541 --> 29:43.097
Would you like
to order drinks?

29:43.132 --> 29:44.653
Thank you, mate. Cheers.

29:48.341 --> 29:49.821
I don't believe this.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.186
What is it?

29:51.221 --> 29:53.941
You see the guy on this side
in the grey suit?

29:53.976 --> 29:56.171
Come with me, please.

30:02.581 --> 30:04.014
Garry Butterworth.

30:05.141 --> 30:07.706
If they hold us overnight,
we're dead.

30:07.741 --> 30:11.186
He's about to go down
for an open-and-shut murder.

30:11.221 --> 30:14.861
Happened on the night we met.
Do you want to go somewhere else?

30:14.896 --> 30:16.546
Put me on to Ella.

30:16.581 --> 30:19.254
Detective Senior Sergeant
Butterworth.

30:20.501 --> 30:22.969
Tell him.

30:30.101 --> 30:32.341
I'm really sorry.
I can't do what you want.

30:32.376 --> 30:33.786
I have to go away.

30:33.821 --> 30:37.341
Ella, now, you're not under arrest,
so I can't stop you from leaving.

30:37.376 --> 30:39.946
But please, please reconsider.

30:39.981 --> 30:42.186
I can understand
you being frightened,

30:42.221 --> 30:44.261
but if you don't testify,
we will have no case

30:44.296 --> 30:46.438
and we will
have to drop the charges.

30:46.473 --> 30:48.546
You've already seen him kill a man.

30:48.581 --> 30:50.221
He doesn't care
what he does to people.

30:50.256 --> 30:51.897
Should he be walking the streets?

30:51.932 --> 30:53.539
That's what you have to ask yourself.

30:54.581 --> 30:56.536
Ella?

30:56.571 --> 30:58.492
Ella?

31:11.221 --> 31:12.939
Salute!

31:18.141 --> 31:20.226
The Carlton Crew.

31:20.261 --> 31:22.181
Hey. What are you looking at?

31:22.216 --> 31:24.146
Nothing, mate.

31:24.181 --> 31:26.141
No, no. What are you looking at?

31:26.176 --> 31:28.436
I'm checking the menu.

31:28.471 --> 31:30.697
You staring at my friends?

31:31.941 --> 31:33.466
No.
Yes, you fucking were.

31:33.501 --> 31:36.426
Listen, buddy.
I'm not looking for any trouble.

31:36.461 --> 31:39.466
Trouble? Who said anything about
trouble? Did I mention trouble?

31:39.501 --> 31:42.021
What do you reckon, princess? Did
I say anything about fucking trouble?

31:42.056 --> 31:43.706
I think you've said enough, mate.

31:43.741 --> 31:45.981
You might want to keep
your fucking hands off me, matey.

31:46.016 --> 31:47.426
Hey. What's up, mate?

31:47.461 --> 31:50.186
This shithead is perving at us.

31:50.221 --> 31:52.301
Well, there's no harm in looking,
is there?

31:52.336 --> 31:53.734
You guys alright?

31:55.501 --> 31:58.061
Yeah. Yeah, sure. We're cool.

31:58.096 --> 32:00.097
Come on, dickhead.

32:01.901 --> 32:03.481
You OK?

32:03.516 --> 32:05.026
Yep.

32:05.061 --> 32:07.741
My fault. You're right -
we should've gone somewhere else.

32:07.776 --> 32:10.421
Those guys should be in jail.
Yeah.

32:10.456 --> 32:12.696
You're right. One day.

32:14.661 --> 32:18.700
It's a gift from Mr Gangitano.
He apologises for any offence.

32:21.501 --> 32:24.174
You tell Mr Gangitano... thanks...

32:25.421 --> 32:26.854
<i>... but no, thanks.</i>

32:28.421 --> 32:30.546
That's why they were celebrating -

32:30.581 --> 32:32.821
key witnesses have just jumped
on a plane and pissed off.

32:32.856 --> 32:34.946
Gone to London for good, we're told.

32:34.981 --> 32:38.461
So, what, the case just collapses?
Can't we extradite them or something?

32:38.496 --> 32:40.106
No, 'cause they haven't
committed a crime.

32:40.141 --> 32:43.101
If they ever do come back,
I'll be at the airport to meet them.

32:43.136 --> 32:47.021
So who paid? Must've cost a bomb.
40 - what? - 50 grand.

32:47.056 --> 32:48.506
Alphonse. Who do you reckon?

32:48.541 --> 32:51.941
Well, you seem pretty relaxed about it -
missing out on a major arrest.

32:51.976 --> 32:53.026
Do I?

32:53.061 --> 32:54.494
Any other leads?

32:56.021 --> 32:58.899
What's a bloke like you
still doing in uniform?

34:06.621 --> 34:09.418
You're 100 short.
It's been a bad month.

34:13.341 --> 34:15.297
I said you're 100 short.

34:16.821 --> 34:19.972
It's all I can afford, Alphonse.
I swear, next month I'll do better.

34:21.181 --> 34:23.489
How can I afford what I haven't got?

34:24.541 --> 34:25.893
Ooh!

34:31.981 --> 34:34.893
I'm very disappointed in you.

34:38.420 --> 34:39.866
We got a problem.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.061
Internal? External?
Internal.

34:42.096 --> 34:44.186
You worried about Alphonse?

34:44.221 --> 34:47.541
He's a heat-seeking missile, mate.
He attracts trouble, it attracts him.

34:47.576 --> 34:49.940
He doesn't pull his head in,
the jacks'll chop it off.

34:49.976 --> 34:52.021
Then they'll come looking
for the rest of us.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.505
You want a coffee or something?

34:53.541 --> 34:55.261
They do fresh juices here?
You name it.

34:55.295 --> 34:57.546
Beetroot, celery, carrot, ginger.

34:57.581 --> 35:00.698
I'd stick with the coffee.
Flat white.

35:01.981 --> 35:04.061
Every man needs a holiday.

35:04.096 --> 35:06.106
I don't want a holiday.

35:06.141 --> 35:09.981
We're worried about you, mate.
You've been under a lot of pressure.

35:10.016 --> 35:12.438
Everyone needs a change.

35:12.473 --> 35:14.826
Don't I pull my weight?

35:14.861 --> 35:18.901
Take Ginny and the kids
to New Zealand - three months on us.

35:18.936 --> 35:21.461
Can I have a moment with the chef,
please, Graham?

35:21.496 --> 35:24.258
Too right. I'll go water the horse.

35:24.293 --> 35:27.021
Me, I'd go while the going's good.

35:27.056 --> 35:28.986
Who's Ella Randall?

35:29.021 --> 35:31.146
First I got the Munster on my back

35:31.181 --> 35:32.626
and now you're here
breaking my balls.

35:32.661 --> 35:34.921
Who is this person you wrote
$30,000 cheques to?

35:34.956 --> 35:37.146
Some bitch I had to pay off
for an abortion.

35:37.181 --> 35:40.061
How do I know? Just leave me alone
about shit like that, will you?

35:40.096 --> 35:42.306
You had everything
and you pissed it all away!

35:42.341 --> 35:45.181
I don't know who you are anymore.
I don't even know what you are.

35:45.216 --> 35:47.266
You know who I am.
You know what I am!

35:47.301 --> 35:49.098
You know what?
And that's why you married me!

35:51.101 --> 35:52.853
Get us a drink!

36:00.501 --> 36:02.746
People called
Alphonse Gangitano

36:02.781 --> 36:06.661
the Black Prince of Lygon Street,
and he loved the notoriety.

36:06.696 --> 36:08.346
He'd beaten a murder rap.

36:08.381 --> 36:12.381
But it had taken its toll
emotionally and financially,

36:12.416 --> 36:15.054
and he was desperate
to keep the crown.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.306
That looks like a wedding ring.

36:18.341 --> 36:21.378
No. Me and the missus,
we have an arrangement.

36:23.941 --> 36:26.501
Why do I always meet guys like you?

36:26.536 --> 36:28.778
You never met anyone like me.

36:28.813 --> 36:30.837
Hey, Jase.
Hey. Hey.

36:30.872 --> 36:32.826
How are you?
Good.

36:32.861 --> 36:34.935
Oh, we're closing. Kitchen's shut.

36:34.970 --> 36:37.010
Alphonse, you remember Tracey.

36:38.061 --> 36:40.386
Does the moon remember the sun?

36:40.421 --> 36:42.651
Does a tulip remember
to flower in spring?

36:43.861 --> 36:46.091
Charmed, Mistress Tracey.

36:48.941 --> 36:52.058
Any chance of getting a glass
of shiraz for a thirsty traveller?

36:54.621 --> 36:56.259
Thanks, darling.

37:03.901 --> 37:06.026
Feel like a bit
of excitement tonight, mate?

37:06.061 --> 37:09.181
There's a guy owes me 20 grand.
Needs a bit of a touch-up.

37:09.216 --> 37:10.906
Who?

37:10.941 --> 37:13.346
You know the Sports Bar?

37:13.381 --> 37:15.341
The boys don't want you
making any more headlines.

37:15.376 --> 37:18.666
You know that, don't you?
I need a win, Jase.

37:18.701 --> 37:22.861
20 grand - the pump gets primed,
I'm back in the game.

37:22.896 --> 37:25.136
Alright? Are you in or what, paesano?

37:32.101 --> 37:34.226
What if he ain't there?

37:34.261 --> 37:36.386
Fuck it,
we'll trash the place.

37:36.421 --> 37:39.458
You want me to come too?
No, this is man's work, Carl.

37:42.101 --> 37:44.456
Go and park up and wait for us.
Yeah, alright.

37:47.701 --> 37:49.621
Better off taking an early mark
tonight, lads.

39:37.621 --> 39:39.054
Fuck!

39:41.301 --> 39:42.781
Let's go.
Where's Alphonse?

39:42.816 --> 39:44.294
Just drive, fat boy!

39:47.981 --> 39:49.426
Come here, fuck ya!

39:49.461 --> 39:51.306
Come on! Take me on, fuck ya!

39:51.341 --> 39:54.781
Where are you going?
Put it down, mate! Put it down.

39:54.816 --> 39:56.558
Settle down! Settle down.
Down!

39:56.593 --> 39:58.266
Hey! Weapon down.
Just drop it.

39:58.301 --> 40:00.661
You want it? You want it?
Don't do anything stupid, Alphonse.

40:00.696 --> 40:02.306
Come on, mate.
Just drop it, mate.

40:02.341 --> 40:04.541
Huh? You know who I am?
I'm the Prince, mate.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.020
I'm the Prince.
Just stop it, OK?

40:12.581 --> 40:14.811
Good boy.
Get the fuck off me!

40:36.821 --> 40:39.946
Fucking liar!

40:39.981 --> 40:42.241
Senior Detective Steve Owen.

40:42.276 --> 40:44.501
Leave it out.
Get off me!

40:44.536 --> 40:47.459
Get...

40:51.181 --> 40:53.058
You fucks!

40:57.541 --> 40:59.826
I truly believe
Alphonse Gangitano

40:59.861 --> 41:03.621
went to that club intending to
inflict as much damage as possible.

41:03.656 --> 41:05.498
The debt was just an excuse.

41:06.541 --> 41:07.986
Why, I don't know.

41:08.021 --> 41:11.013
Maybe he was just trying to silence
the devil voices in his head.
