WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:04.636
(helicopter whirring)

00:11.278 --> 00:13.345
(mechanical whirring)

00:20.755 --> 00:22.654
We got a possible IED.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.189
Batteries, wire, pipe.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.190
Five...

00:25.192 --> 00:26.525
(mechanical whirring)

00:26.527 --> 00:28.727
Confirming no visible
identification.

00:28.729 --> 00:29.728
Four...

00:31.565 --> 00:33.065
Blocking remote
detonators.

00:33.067 --> 00:33.933
Three...

00:33.934 --> 00:34.800
Going to try
chemical detection.

00:34.802 --> 00:35.734
Burning nerve agents.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.736
Two...

00:37.738 --> 00:39.204
This isn't good.

00:39.206 --> 00:39.738
...one.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.407
Fire in the hole.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.808
(explosion)

00:46.814 --> 00:48.814
I'm dying already.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.149
Want me to write you
a note?

00:50.151 --> 00:51.650
Get you out of class?
Could ya?

00:51.652 --> 00:53.118
Would ya,
Officer Lane?

00:53.120 --> 00:54.620
WORDY:
Boss, what's the word?

00:54.622 --> 00:56.789
They got a guy coming
for the AC.

00:56.791 --> 00:57.924
Alleluia.
Okay.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.058
Oh, come on.
Nice.
Tomorrow.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.160
Okay, we're going to hit
the briefing room

01:01.162 --> 01:03.662
and then we're going to patrol
in air-conditioned comfort.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.065
Have I told you recently
how much I really do love you?

01:06.067 --> 01:08.067
Hello, boys.
Jules!

01:08.069 --> 01:11.070
How do you manage
to stay so fresh?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.438
I think cool thoughts.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.672
PARKER:
<i> Kira, we're going to hit</i>

01:13.674 --> 01:14.840
the streets.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.075
Team Two's going
to hit Rexdale.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.778
Sergeant Rangford.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.813
That's, uh,

01:20.815 --> 01:22.648
Mr. Rangford to you, sir.

01:22.650 --> 01:23.816
Hey, don't
call me sir.

01:23.818 --> 01:24.783
I work for a living.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.251
How you doing,
Daniel?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.820
I'm doing fine.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.388
It's good to see
you, Greg.
Good to see you, too.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.389
You look good.

01:30.391 --> 01:31.490
What are you doing
out in the barn?

01:31.492 --> 01:32.624
A day like today
you should be out

01:32.626 --> 01:33.992
hitting a golf
course.

01:33.993 --> 01:35.359
Are you kidding me?
You been out there?

01:35.362 --> 01:36.528
Well....
You don't call.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.563
You don't write.

01:37.565 --> 01:38.797
Eddie.

01:38.799 --> 01:39.865
How you doing?

01:39.867 --> 01:41.200
Fine. Fine.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.835
(phone rings)
So?

01:42.837 --> 01:44.203
How's Sophie and Clark?

01:44.205 --> 01:45.838
They're good.
They're all good, yeah.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.406
KIRA:
SRU?
Spike.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.740
You still wear
the rookie badge?

01:48.742 --> 01:49.775
Nah-uh.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.110
This is, uh,
Sam Braddock.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.411
He's new, but he's trying.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.512
Good to meet you, I'm Danny.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.746
Hot call, Team One, gear up.

01:54.748 --> 01:55.848
PARKER:
What do we got?

01:55.850 --> 01:57.416
Suspicious package.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.417
Train station,

01:58.419 --> 01:59.218
south terminal.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.285
Babycakes,

02:00.287 --> 02:01.787
Take it easy, Danny.
I'm coming!

02:01.789 --> 02:03.789
Let's go!

02:03.791 --> 02:05.724
Hey, Danny!

02:05.726 --> 02:08.293
Keep the peace, boys.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.496
(sirens blaring)

02:13.467 --> 02:14.633
Who called it in?

02:14.635 --> 02:16.435
PARKER:
The security guard.

02:16.436 --> 02:18.236
He says the suitcase has
been there almost an hour.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.572
Copy that.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.906
We gotta keep
that perimeter wide.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.474
We gotta keep it locked down.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.909
(sirens blaring)

02:23.911 --> 02:25.677
Hey, who's that guy
at the station?

02:25.679 --> 02:27.579
Danny Rangford.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.480
Most decent, honest cop
I've ever met in my life.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.517
Guy's a legend,
retired about a year ago.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.552
He's the guy that brought me
into the SRU.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.554
You?
Yeah. Him and
Barney Fletcher,

02:35.556 --> 02:37.456
the two of 'em,
they fought to have us trained

02:37.458 --> 02:39.191
in psychology and negotiation.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.527
If it wasn't for them,
we'd be straight-up SWAT.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.728
So he was commander?

02:42.730 --> 02:44.730
Never made it past sergeant.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.398
Avoided promotion.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.666
Why?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.868
Keeps you in the action.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.538
Thought maybe it was the booze.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.741
You didn't smell it off him?

02:57.411 --> 02:58.410
You new?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.778
Three weeks.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.747
Uh, look, do you know
if anyone's using

03:01.749 --> 03:02.781
the briefing room
in the next little while?

03:02.783 --> 03:04.283
Mmm, I don't think so.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.951
Team Three's gone off shift.
Team One's out.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.653
Good. I just want to get
a few things in order.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.854
(phone rings)
Is it okay if I use the room?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.289
Go ahead.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.723
I'm just gonna have
a walkabout first.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.225
Is that okay?
Mm-hmm.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.294
Strategic Response Unit.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.765
Okay.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.890
(garbled radio transmission)

03:46.827 --> 03:48.894
(siren blaring)

03:53.801 --> 03:54.866
(tires screeching)

04:02.876 --> 04:04.409
Morning, Sergeant.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.943
Inspector Stainton,
what's the word?

04:05.946 --> 04:07.946
We're not
liking this.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.947
There's been a spike in
terrorist chat last two weeks.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.951
Station sees over 200,000
commuters a day.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.954
I say that's "hotspot"
written all over it.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.556
Sam, north containment.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.858
Lewis, west.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.860
Wordy, east.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.996
ED:
Spike, do your thing.

04:23.998 --> 04:26.031
Jules, second
the boss.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.499
Stay connected.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.435
We're gonna need
everyone's brain on this one.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.804
Let's get to know
our friend.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.945
Kira, can I trouble
you a sec?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.680
Mm-hmm.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.749
There's a, uh, file I've
been meaning to look at.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.350
A file?

04:45.352 --> 04:46.785
Yeah, it's #5512.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.954
You'll find it
under Team Four, 1989.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.455
Okay.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.057
What's this in regard to?

04:52.059 --> 04:54.059
Uh, just getting a presentation
together.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.295
You know, old boys
on the lecture circuit.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.997
Uh, it's probably
not on a computer.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.499
Uh, look, if it's any trouble

05:00.500 --> 05:02.000
I can always go down
to the archives myself.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.502
Oh, no, no, no, it's no trouble.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.970
I just need to clear it
with Commander Holleran.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.306
Uh, what do you need
to do that for?

05:07.308 --> 05:09.975
Oh, I just can't release files
without permission.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.576
It's policy.
Uh, well, well,

05:11.578 --> 05:14.046
it's not like it's a breech
of, uh, anyone's privacy.

05:14.048 --> 05:15.914
I-I mean, it was a case
of my own.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.683
I was there.
Sorry.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.017
Officially,
you're a civilian now.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.385
So.
No.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.322
You don't need to do that.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.992
(sighs)
Look,

05:26.994 --> 05:28.994
the old days,

05:28.996 --> 05:30.996
one of us at the desk,
you know--

05:30.998 --> 05:33.365
we'd have looked the other way.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.499
Huh?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.034
Well, I'm sure
Commander Holleran...

05:36.036 --> 05:38.637
You're not hearing me.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.108
I didn't come this far....

05:45.546 --> 05:47.612
(sighs)

05:48.916 --> 05:49.981
Stay quiet.
But I can just...

05:49.983 --> 05:51.983
Mmm. Just stay quiet.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.453
And look down, hmm?

05:54.455 --> 05:57.022
I need that file.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.057
Do you understand?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.927
Yep.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.929
Let's go, darling.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.997
(mechanical whirring)

06:08.936 --> 06:11.870
10:36 a.m.: suspicious suitcase.

06:11.872 --> 06:15.540
Constable Scarlatti initiating
electronic counter measures.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.609
(mechanical whirring)

06:21.782 --> 06:23.949
I'll wait here.
You go on and get the file.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.951
Fast is good.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.953
(sighs)

06:27.955 --> 06:29.955
Wait.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.690
I'll take that.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.692
Sorry.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.527
(beeping)

06:35.529 --> 06:36.928
(lock clicks)

06:38.899 --> 06:40.966
(panting)

06:49.710 --> 06:51.176
Okay, know the subject,

06:51.178 --> 06:53.545
anticipate the weapon,
target the solution.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.579
What kind of person

06:54.581 --> 06:56.148
plants a bomb in a public place?

06:56.150 --> 06:58.150
Organized personality,
not impulsive,

06:58.152 --> 07:00.018
not mentally incompetent.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.454
Emotionally detached,
above average intelligence.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.123
Access to volatile material.
and familiar with its use.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.658
Yeah, and who wants
to strike

07:06.660 --> 07:08.059
the city's transportation hub.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.128
Or just doesn't like tourists.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.097
Okay, everyone,
eyes and ears open.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.965
We may be dealing
with an individual

07:13.967 --> 07:15.734
who likes
to hang around

07:15.736 --> 07:17.102
and watch the carnage.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.074
Wasn't supposed to go this way,
you know?

07:23.076 --> 07:25.744
Wasn't supposed
to go this way.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.212
Could have just
given it to me.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.679
All I needed to do was go
in the briefing room,

07:28.682 --> 07:31.183
get a little work done,
undisturbed.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.552
I'll make sure
you're not interrupted.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.953
Uh-huh.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.555
Well, maybe you're not trained
for this at your desk,

07:36.557 --> 07:38.156
but where I came from we're
trained to profile people,

07:38.158 --> 07:39.825
and here's what
I get from you:

07:39.827 --> 07:41.493
you're ambitious; you're
serious about your job;

07:41.495 --> 07:43.829
you don't want to be passive,
be perceived as the victim.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.163
So here's what you'll do:

07:45.165 --> 07:46.998
I walk into that
briefing room,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.800
you'll sound the alarm
first chance you get.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.068
I try walking out of here,

07:50.070 --> 07:51.787
same problem.

07:51.788 --> 07:53.505
Man with a gun making
unorthodox demands.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.840
You see my dilemmas?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.608
Smile.
Hey, Kira.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.610
Any word on the
air conditioning?

07:58.612 --> 07:59.911
Tomorrow.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.249
Sergeant Rangford?

08:04.251 --> 08:05.517
Troy.

08:05.518 --> 08:06.784
You hear I made sergeant?

08:06.787 --> 08:09.621
Team Three.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.723
So you haunting
the old barn?

08:11.725 --> 08:14.559
Yeah.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.966
Sit down.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.634
Sit. Sit.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.137
(mechanical whirring)

08:27.274 --> 08:31.109
Okay, confirming no visible
identification.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.711
Babycakes is

08:32.713 --> 08:34.980
sending out a signal
blocking out remote detonators.

08:34.982 --> 08:38.717
Going to start
with the infrared.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.051
Good news so far.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.087
Nothing unusual in
the heat patterns.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.155
Going to try chemical detection

08:44.157 --> 08:46.224
for any nerve agents,
blood agents.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.559
Sergeant.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.561
Inspector, anything good?

08:49.563 --> 08:50.829
Some of the people that reported

08:50.831 --> 08:53.565
the case said
they smelled hay nearby.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.133
So? Hay?

08:55.135 --> 08:56.568
"Moist hay."

08:56.570 --> 08:59.271
One woman said she smelled
freshly cut grass.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.605
Stainton, so what
are you saying?

09:00.607 --> 09:02.741
That someone stuffed
the case with hay?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.743
Boss. Hay and grass
aren't the only things

09:04.745 --> 09:06.311
that smell like hay and grass.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.179
Those people that smelled
hay and grass?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.881
Track them down,
they gotta be put

09:09.883 --> 09:11.917
under medical observation
immediately.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.553
No physical exertion
or it'll accelerate the spread.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.954
Spike, what do you think it is?

09:15.956 --> 09:16.988
Phosgene.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.124
It could be phosgene.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.259
By the time you smell it, it's
already at its lethal level.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.603
TROY:
So, Daniel.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.572
You and Michelle finally
gonna take that

09:33.574 --> 09:35.073
round-the-world trip
she kept asking for?

09:36.043 --> 09:39.110
Well... maybe.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.113
Little hot in that?

09:42.115 --> 09:44.182
Mmm.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.286
Yeah.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.289
You know what?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.924
No, I'm-I'm good. I'm good.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.093
Anything I can help you
with there, Daniel?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.262
I'm fine, Troy.
I'm really fine.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.766
I just want to be left alone,
okay?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.969
I don't think
that's a good idea.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.340
Stand down!

10:08.342 --> 10:10.809
Stay back!

10:11.745 --> 10:13.311
Stay back!

10:13.313 --> 10:14.379
MAN:
Hey, sergeant?

10:14.381 --> 10:15.714
TROY:
Keep it cool, guys.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.781
Everything's okay.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.516
Okay, Troy,

10:18.517 --> 10:20.250
you're going to keep your boys
at a distance.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.786
Sure.

10:21.788 --> 10:22.821
Sure, Daniel.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.656
You know how this works, boys.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.627
(static crackling)

10:28.629 --> 10:29.961
Kira?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.129
(static crackling)

10:31.131 --> 10:33.131
Kira, did you try
to transmit?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.733
What's up, Jules?

10:34.735 --> 10:36.919
I don't know.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.104
This is not the way it was
supposed to happen, you know.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.640
Never is, right?

10:41.642 --> 10:42.674
No.

10:42.676 --> 10:43.742
Look at me.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.076
I'm the subject.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.177
TROY:
You don't have
to be, Daniel.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.946
We can work this out.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.798
Sorry, Troy.

10:49.799 --> 10:51.649
(beeping)
Wait. She's sending
something through.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.419
Sarge.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.255
Kira?

10:57.257 --> 11:00.125
Kira, you copy?

11:00.127 --> 11:01.426
Jules, you're in charge.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.662
All right.
Lean on Stainton if you need to.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.196
Eddie, we got a priority call.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.399
I need you, Sam and Wordy
to come with me.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.300
Louis, you cover Spike.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.137
Jules, let's get extra uniforms
and detectives.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.805
Copy that. I'm on it.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.340
Ed, the priority call...

11:15.342 --> 11:17.709
it's at the station.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.447
Why don't you
tell me what's...
Don't...

11:22.449 --> 11:24.983
negotiate me.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.752
Now,

11:27.754 --> 11:28.953
go in here.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.689
I'm gonna shut the door.

11:30.691 --> 11:31.890
I'm barricading myself in.

11:31.892 --> 11:32.991
You understand what that means,

11:32.993 --> 11:34.793
don't you, Troy?
I do.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.295
And you're gonna leave me
to my own devices.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.764
Otherwise, the situation
is going to get dangerous.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.800
You know that, right?
Right.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.402
I want you to consider me
a threat level red.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.804
You got that?

11:45.806 --> 11:47.105
I got it, boss.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.407
I'm gonna stop talking now.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.876
Threat level red.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.378
Can you say that for me?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.013
Threat level red.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.818
That's good.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.387
Doing a good job, Troy.

12:09.863 --> 12:13.932
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

12:45.365 --> 12:46.898
(sirens blaring)

12:46.900 --> 12:48.517
KIRA:
<i> It's Daniel Rangford.</i>

12:48.518 --> 12:50.135
<i>He's armed, and he's barricaded</i>
<i> himself in the briefing room.</i>

12:50.137 --> 12:51.436
Boss.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.504
PARKER:
Talk.

12:52.506 --> 12:53.972
He's got a Beretta,
.40 cal.

12:53.974 --> 12:54.990
Panels hold
up to that?

12:54.991 --> 12:56.007
Yeah, yeah,
they're polycarb.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.242
So, what's he
doing in there?

12:57.244 --> 12:58.810
He disabled
a security camera.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.377
He hasn't talked since
he shut himself in there.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.180
Classified himself
a threat level red.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.915
Negotiated me
like I was a rookie.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.250
Are you surprised?

13:05.252 --> 13:06.951
Can your team
cover the entrances?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.670
Yeah, we're all
we got, though.

13:08.671 --> 13:10.388
Most of my guys already
clocked out.
Yeah, we're
down three.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.123
The rest of us are dealing
with the bomb threat.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.058
You want me to call
my guys back in?
Yes.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.593
No.
Eddie?

13:15.594 --> 13:17.127
Boss, we keep this
in the family.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.030
We can handle it.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.835
Okay, Eddie.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.470
Nobody gets in
through the front.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.871
Garage access only.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.556
I'm assuming
he's closed the blinds,

13:28.557 --> 13:30.240
but we still need eyes in,
so grab some range finders.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.177
Go outside
and double-check.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.578
Copy that.
Wordy,

13:33.580 --> 13:35.146
he's gonna be looking
for the snake,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.548
so let's use
the fiber cam.

13:36.550 --> 13:37.549
Got it.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.951
Auto-transcriptor, boss?

13:39.953 --> 13:41.886
We don't need it.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.588
Jules has it anyway.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.357
It could just be for us or...

13:46.359 --> 13:47.959
Or what, Greg?
We could
decide that

13:47.961 --> 13:50.061
when this thing
is over, okay?

13:50.063 --> 13:51.062
All right.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.297
Let's use Team Three's.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.165
You set it up,
but call his wife first.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.333
Her name is Michelle.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.035
Let's figure out
what's been going on

13:57.037 --> 13:57.936
at home lately, okay?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.103
On it.
Okay.

13:59.105 --> 14:02.140
I want you to talk to him, okay?

14:02.142 --> 14:05.176
None of us can stay objective,
but you know him best.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.412
Yeah.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.546
All right, good.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.049
Kira, walk with me.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.923
So, what do we know
about phosgene?

14:18.925 --> 14:20.558
It's not hard to make,
and it's nasty.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.061
Could take 24 hours
to show symptoms,

14:23.063 --> 14:25.163
so your victims don't
even know they've been exposed

14:25.165 --> 14:26.865
until their lungs
stop working.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.867
Okay, well, Stainton's on top
of the med reports.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.134
I'll tell him to alert his units

14:30.136 --> 14:32.170
for a potential
chemical evac order.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.305
Maybe we need to block
incoming trains as well.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.540
Anything else?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.008
Get him to broaden
the perimeter,

14:37.010 --> 14:38.042
especially downwind.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.143
Got it.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.044
Okay, Babycakes.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.646
Let's take a look inside.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.887
Danny?

14:48.889 --> 14:50.321
What's this I'm hearing

14:50.323 --> 14:53.391
about you being in there
with a gun, huh?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.261
Telling Troy it's
threat level red?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.232
Danny, come on.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.334
Last time we talked,
threat level red was code

15:03.336 --> 15:05.303
for "there's a wife
in the station."

15:07.040 --> 15:09.474
It's just me out here, Danny.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.542
It's Eddie.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.113
PARKER:
Kira, what happened?

15:15.115 --> 15:16.414
He seemed fine
when we left.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.616
I mean, how did
he seem to you?
Calm at first.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.084
Well, sweating a lot.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.387
Yeah, well, we all are, right?

15:22.389 --> 15:25.123
But steady eye contact,
relaxed posture, chatty.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.525
Then, when I wouldn't get
the file for him,

15:27.527 --> 15:30.461
he came off the rails
like that wasn't the plan.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.063
What do you think the plan was?

15:32.065 --> 15:33.998
Didn't add up: getting the file,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.034
preparing a presentation
in the briefing room.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.102
He wanted privacy.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.971
Think he wanted to leave
the station with that file?

15:39.973 --> 15:41.473
No, I don't think so.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.974
And he didn't want Holleran
alerted, right?

15:42.976 --> 15:44.375
That's right.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.044
Remember anything
about the file?

15:46.046 --> 15:47.178
Uh...

15:47.180 --> 15:49.113
name in it was Gehring, 1989.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.115
'89, so there's no
computer backup.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.383
Anything about that case?

15:52.385 --> 15:54.152
Just that it was his. Sorry.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.154
No, no, you did everything
right, Kira. Thank you.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.989
You can go home.
You're free to do that.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.190
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.291
I'm a cop, too.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.160
Okay.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.228
Put on a vest and radio.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.496
Call Harvey Silver.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.265
His name and number
is on file.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.900
He was on
Daniel's team.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.534
They retired the same year.
Tell him we need him here

16:10.537 --> 16:12.236
sooner than ASAP.

16:12.238 --> 16:13.638
Eddie, how is our friend?

16:13.640 --> 16:14.973
He's not talking.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.041
WORDY (whispering):
I got eyes in.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.117
(tearing)

16:26.119 --> 16:28.486
ED:
Fiber optic
neutralized.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.156
Troy, you got eyes
outside?

16:32.158 --> 16:33.257
He's moving.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.093
Looks like he's closing
the shutters.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.361
Want to try
the ball cam?

16:36.363 --> 16:37.729
He's gonna be
looking for that.

16:37.731 --> 16:40.465
Let's get thermals.
Okay, I got it
right here.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.371
Danny?

16:46.373 --> 16:49.140
You sticky
my fiber-optic camera?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.108
Nice job.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.442
What did you use, duct tape?

16:53.213 --> 16:55.546
Forgot how much you
liked it low-tech.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.751
Remember that
corner store barricade?

17:01.121 --> 17:03.321
Danny, day like today,
hotter than hell.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.789
You remember that?

17:04.791 --> 17:07.325
You had me talk to those kids
for an hour and half, Danny.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.326
Then, you came in.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.994
Turned up the heat.

17:09.995 --> 17:11.661
20 minutes later,
they came running out.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.265
That was low-tech all the way.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.167
RANGFORD:
Thought you were on
a bomb call, Ed.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.535
ED:
We're on it.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.338
Just came back here
to see what was going on.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.639
I'm not here
to negotiate you, Danny.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.274
I just want to help you
figure it out.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.275
All you've done

17:24.277 --> 17:25.610
for me
over the years.

17:25.612 --> 17:26.744
Come on.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.346
Go back to your bomb call.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.615
Frank's on it, Danny.
You know the bomb guys.

17:30.617 --> 17:34.052
You know what's good for you,
you stay out of there.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.220
I'm not going anywhere.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.321
I'm gonna stay
right here

17:37.323 --> 17:40.158
long as it takes.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.759
Danny, what are you saying
to me? How long?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.395
Oh, uh...

17:44.397 --> 17:46.831
about 14 more ounces.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.807
SAM:
11:27 a.m.:

17:55.809 --> 17:57.108
Barricaded subject,

17:57.110 --> 17:58.810
Daniel Rangford.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.311
Boss, how do
you want me

18:00.313 --> 18:01.712
to characterize
the subject?

18:01.714 --> 18:03.081
Barricaded.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.582
Leave it
at that.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.617
You talk to his wife?
Yes, I
called her.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.286
I told her her husband
was at the station,

18:08.288 --> 18:10.321
and she got really upset;
she hung up on me.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.589
It's all you.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.825
ED:
Boss, come and see this.

18:13.827 --> 18:16.360
(gun firing)
Eddie?

18:16.362 --> 18:18.129
He's shooting at nothing.
He's shooting at a chair.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.197
I got thermals.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.265
RANGFORD:
On the ground.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.434
Danny!
On the ground!

18:23.436 --> 18:25.236
Danny, our weapons
are not raised.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.338
We are not here
to hurt you.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.273
Down... down!

18:29.275 --> 18:30.408
Danny, talk to me.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.642
(gun firing)

18:32.779 --> 18:34.412
(gun firing)

18:36.316 --> 18:39.350
Danny, it's
Greg Parker.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.351
What's going
on, buddy?

18:40.353 --> 18:42.120
What are you
shooting at?

18:56.169 --> 18:57.568
What's going on?
I don't know.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.203
He's shooting at somebody
who's not there.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.338
Is it hallucination?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.440
Yeah, maybe flashbacks
or something.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.441
Where is Daniel?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.676
I want to see him.
Where is he?

19:05.678 --> 19:07.311
What the hell is going on, guys?

19:07.313 --> 19:08.479
No one through the front.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.914
SAM:
Ma'am, you cannot
go in there.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.516
Sam, Sam, it's okay.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.550
Michelle.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.218
I want to see him.
Where is he?

19:14.220 --> 19:15.887
Let's just walk over here
for a second.
Where is he?

19:15.889 --> 19:17.421
We can talk about
it over here.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.257
Let's just walk
over here.
I want to see him.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.391
You bastard,
you bastard.
It's okay.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.626
It's your fault.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.261
You do this to him,
all of you.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.662
You bastard!

19:25.865 --> 19:28.332
Just calm down.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.635
It's okay. It's okay.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.936
Just go with Kira,

19:31.938 --> 19:34.238
and we'll find you a place
to sit down, okay?

19:34.240 --> 19:36.941
And I promise I will come to you
as soon as I can, okay?

19:36.943 --> 19:38.276
Michelle,
let's sit down.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.810
It's gonna be okay.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.420
WORDY:
Boss.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.821
Take a look.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.657
All right, that's enough.
I'm gonna open it up.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.142
He said he was gonna fire.

19:54.143 --> 19:55.626
You want to spend the rest
of your life thinking

19:55.628 --> 19:57.228
about what we should
have done, Wordy, huh?

19:57.230 --> 19:58.229
Okay.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.230
Wordy, cover.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.665
Sam, we're opening up.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.206
ED:
Okay, boss.
Okay, go.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.913
I told you not to come in!

20:22.322 --> 20:23.754
Let's slow
this down, Danny.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.456
Close the damn door!

20:25.458 --> 20:27.391
I'm not gonna be able
to do that, Dan.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.595
One step closer, we're done.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.463
Okay.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.633
Let the subject
set the pace.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.501
Don't rush a
negotiation.

20:37.503 --> 20:39.604
'Cause I'm not
finished here.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.405
And I'm going
to get this thing, right.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.406
Okay, Eddie?

20:42.408 --> 20:44.308
Okay.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.509
Back off.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.980
ED:
Boss?

20:48.982 --> 20:50.581
I'll go talk to Michelle.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.983
I think he's slowing up,

20:51.985 --> 20:53.918
so let's just keep him
on his timetable, okay?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.253
ED:
Okay.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.926
He's arriving now.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.761
Harvey, I'm Sam, Team One.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.396
Where is he?
I want to see him.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.465
That's not gonna happen.
I got to talk
to him.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.667
He'll listen to me.
Harvey, this isn't a good idea.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.502
This is garbage.
I can't just stand here.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.371
Harvey, there's not a guy here
who feels different,

21:13.373 --> 21:15.706
but we just need to streamline
the inputs a little, okay?

21:15.708 --> 21:17.408
Ed Lane is with him now.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.377
Eddie's with him?

21:19.379 --> 21:22.346
Yeah.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.381
Okay.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.749
Okay... good, we need your help.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.484
We need you to remember
everything you can

21:26.486 --> 21:28.552
about the Gehring incident
in 1989.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.868
This is not good.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.736
We got a possible IED.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.605
Batteries, wire, pipe.

21:47.607 --> 21:48.973
Is that shrapnel?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.975
It could be; it's not nails

21:50.977 --> 21:53.444
or ball bearings... some kind
of small objects, though.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.478
This thing could
be on a timer.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.479
It could be motion-sensitive,

21:55.481 --> 21:56.547
so we're not taking it anywhere.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.349
We detonate it here
in the square?

21:58.351 --> 21:59.650
Negative.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.052
Detonating will only
release more gas.

22:01.054 --> 22:02.053
We do a render-safe

22:02.055 --> 22:03.087
with the water cannon.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.355
Okay.

22:04.357 --> 22:05.856
We got to disrupt the mechanism.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.759
And turn the phosgene
into hydrochloric acid.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.864
I promise
you'll see him

22:13.866 --> 22:16.567
as soon as we know
it's safe.
"Safe?"

22:16.569 --> 22:18.536
Michelle, we need
to understand what he's doing,

22:18.538 --> 22:20.004
where he's coming from.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.372
Can you help us?

22:21.374 --> 22:23.808
Yeah, of course I'll help.
Thank you,

22:23.810 --> 22:25.443
'cause, um...

22:25.445 --> 22:27.411
'Cause you're the one
who knows them best.

22:27.413 --> 22:28.646
You think?

22:28.648 --> 22:31.482
I know the guy I married.
I remember him.

22:31.484 --> 22:34.452
This guy?

22:34.454 --> 22:37.788
I mean, I was counting the days
till he retired.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.623
Till he came back to us.

22:39.625 --> 22:42.460
To me and Liam.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.428
Wake up to the world.

22:44.430 --> 22:45.996
Have a barbeque,
put up his feet.

22:45.998 --> 22:49.700
Enjoy something.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.736
Didn't work out that way, huh?

22:51.738 --> 22:53.804
No (sniffles).

22:53.806 --> 22:56.640
'Cause when he took off
the uniform,

22:56.642 --> 22:59.477
it turns out there was
nothing left underneath.

23:05.451 --> 23:06.884
Almost there.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.554
All right, we've just got
to get past the part

23:10.556 --> 23:12.990
of him that sticks to a plan.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.793
So maybe we bypass
the logic brain,

23:15.795 --> 23:17.027
force him to run out of there.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.029
Thinking about tear gas?

23:19.031 --> 23:20.965
The animal instinct
in the midbrain

23:20.967 --> 23:22.500
thinks it's Johnny
run for air.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.468
I don't recommend it.

23:24.470 --> 23:25.669
Why's that, Danny?

23:25.671 --> 23:27.171
You're going to have
to evacuate

23:27.173 --> 23:29.440
the whole building
for three days

23:29.442 --> 23:31.976
just to breathe in here.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.745
Three weeks with
a sanitation crew.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.547
We're not worried
about making messes, Danny.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.182
Think it through, boys.

23:39.118 --> 23:40.918
Want to cripple the SRU?

23:40.920 --> 23:43.621
All on the gamble
that I didn't think of, uh,

23:43.623 --> 23:45.923
packing a gas mask in this bag?

23:46.893 --> 23:49.560
Does he let you touch him?

23:50.797 --> 23:52.563
No, he doesn't.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.533
And I don't mean just in bed.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.870
I try to hold his hand,
he pulls away.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.542
The last time he touched me,
I woke up with his hands

24:04.544 --> 24:07.077
around my neck
and he was screaming at me.

24:08.514 --> 24:11.081
He's been hanging off
a cliff these years.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.151
He won't talk to me.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.454
Not about work, he never has.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.656
And he won't talk to you.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.891
'Cause he knows.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.561
You'll shake your heads, "Oh, so
sad to see the great guy fall.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.728
"What happened to him?

24:24.730 --> 24:25.996
We thought he could hack it."

24:25.998 --> 24:27.832
And you'll turn
your backs

24:27.834 --> 24:28.933
so that you can keep on

24:28.935 --> 24:30.835
pretending that
he's the exception.

24:35.608 --> 24:39.009
Michelle, it's
going to be okay.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.744
It's okay.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.981
ED:
Danny.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.851
We are not playing chess
here, now.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.253
You're thinking
about a permanent solution

24:49.255 --> 24:52.690
to a temporary problem.
I appreciate

24:52.692 --> 24:53.958
your faith, Ed, but...

24:53.960 --> 24:55.759
Right, then you've got
to appreciate...

24:55.761 --> 24:56.994
Don't interrupt the subject!

24:56.996 --> 24:58.996
Don't handbook me, Danny.
Danny,

24:58.998 --> 25:02.199
faith is what you need
when there's no proof.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.702
We don't need faith to know
that you deserve to live.

25:04.704 --> 25:05.936
Oh, yeah?

25:05.938 --> 25:07.705
That's something you can prove?

25:07.707 --> 25:10.241
Yeah. Yeah, I think I can.

25:10.243 --> 25:11.642
Let's talk
about all the people

25:11.644 --> 25:13.577
whose lives were
made longer because of you.

25:13.579 --> 25:15.679
Don't start.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.883
The Gehring incident.
It was a home invasion.

25:18.885 --> 25:22.052
Regent Park, but this little
place was neat as a pin.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.654
You know who's keeping house?

25:23.656 --> 25:25.189
Little 18-year-old.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.723
Parents are both deadbeats;
one's in jail;

25:26.726 --> 25:29.293
one's AWOL; and she's
holding it all together,

25:29.295 --> 25:30.895
looking after
her little brother and sister.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.931
What happened
with the home invasion?
By the time

25:33.933 --> 25:35.533
we got on scene,
the bad guys had gone.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.601
The girl, she'd taken
a whack at one of the guys

25:37.603 --> 25:38.736
with a baseball bat,
scared him away.

25:38.738 --> 25:41.639
So the team went
back out on patrol,

25:41.641 --> 25:43.607
and Danny and I stayed behind
to write it up.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.042
That was it?

25:45.044 --> 25:46.744
The little guy,
ten years old,

25:46.746 --> 25:49.146
wanted to show us
his baseball card collection.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.681
I said, "No, we've got to go."

25:50.683 --> 25:52.016
And Danny says,
"No. Let's stay."

25:52.018 --> 25:53.751
He just bought a fresh pack
for his own son,

25:53.753 --> 25:55.719
went out to the truck
to get them.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.589
We sat crossed-legs
on the floor.

25:58.591 --> 26:02.192
Middle of the afternoon,
summer day...

26:02.194 --> 26:04.795
trading baseball cards
with little guy...

26:06.098 --> 26:08.666
It was good.

26:08.668 --> 26:11.201
You remember this pretty clear
for such a long time ago.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.703
Yeah, well, you would.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.605
Two hours later,
it wasn't our file anymore.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.574
It was Homicide's.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.212
ED:
That little girl
down by the dock.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.048
Remember her?

26:24.050 --> 26:25.783
She was turning blue.

26:25.785 --> 26:26.951
You could hardly breathe

26:26.953 --> 26:29.053
and you did
mouth-to-mouth on her

26:29.055 --> 26:31.221
in the ambulance,
all the way to the hospital.

26:31.223 --> 26:32.790
Buddy, you saved her life.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.158
You stayed with her
the whole time

26:34.160 --> 26:35.993
and then they called
from the hospital.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.895
To say, "Congratulations.
She's gonna live."

26:37.897 --> 26:40.264
Danny, you got the Silver Shield
for that, buddy.

26:41.667 --> 26:45.135
Proudest freakin'
nine seconds of my career.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.638
'Cause then they
give the punch line,

26:47.640 --> 26:50.874
which is something
we don't tell the rookies, hmm?

26:52.278 --> 26:54.812
About how the girl
was brain-damaged

26:54.814 --> 26:56.097
from lack of oxygen.

26:56.098 --> 26:57.381
Oh, yeah,
she's going to live,

26:57.383 --> 27:00.784
like a vegetable,
shriveling up

27:00.786 --> 27:03.887
until her family decides
to pull the plug

27:03.889 --> 27:05.990
and put her out of her misery.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.725
Which I've got to say,

27:07.727 --> 27:10.127
seems to be a good idea
right about now.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.096
Danny. Danny...

27:12.098 --> 27:15.332
I know you're self-esteeming me
like crazy here,

27:15.334 --> 27:17.134
but you know what?

27:17.136 --> 27:19.670
That's the last thing
I need right now.

27:19.672 --> 27:22.139
That's the last thing.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.241
Excuse me.
Okay, Danny.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.810
All right.
Let's take a break.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.679
ED
He's almost at the bottom
of that bottle.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.114
PARKER:
The more we talk,
the faster he drinks.

27:30.116 --> 27:33.417
Let's just... take a little
pressure off, okay?

27:33.419 --> 27:34.918
Boss, I'm not going
to leave him.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.854
All right, you stay.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.389
You stay, but let him
do his thing.

27:38.391 --> 27:39.857
Okay.
I need to find out

27:39.859 --> 27:40.958
what's going on
in that file.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.192
Okay.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.732
We get the homicide file yet?

27:48.734 --> 27:49.833
Squad car's flying it over.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.202
Give you a deadline?
Yeah, what's left

27:52.204 --> 27:54.038
of his bottle of scotch.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.840
Harvey, what do you remember?

27:56.842 --> 27:59.810
Two victims:
older sister, younger boy.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.979
Perps got away.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.981
Tragic as hell,
but it's nothing we don't see.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.849
Yeah, but why did
this one get to him?

28:05.851 --> 28:07.051
What was different about it?

28:07.053 --> 28:08.752
Did you ever talk to him
about it?

28:08.754 --> 28:09.920
I don't know.
You know how it goes.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.255
I might've asked him
how he was doing?

28:11.257 --> 28:13.290
What'd he say?

28:14.226 --> 28:15.292
"I'm fine."

28:17.063 --> 28:18.796
"I'm fine."

28:30.409 --> 28:31.709
Inspector,
we're getting ready

28:31.711 --> 28:32.810
to counter
the package here.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.712
No one comes close.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.080
Perimeter is locked up.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.493
Thanks.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.228
Danny, you thirsty
at all in there?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.831
Huh?

28:53.833 --> 28:55.833
Danny? A little water, buddy.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.434
I'm going to roll it
in there, okay?

28:57.436 --> 28:59.503
No surprises.

29:00.806 --> 29:02.172
Nice and easy.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.952
Incoming from Homicide.

29:14.954 --> 29:18.355
Gehring, Jeremy,
August 8, 1989.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.791
"August 8."
That's today.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.060
Find out why.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.962
We got a witness tape.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.363
All right, dig out a VCR.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.498
Let's get some answers.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.932
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.467
It's Beta.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.806
Oh, he's almost finished
that bottle.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.908
I'm going to open it up.
Are you sure?

29:37.910 --> 29:40.077
Yeah, we need more access.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.345
Sam, I need you.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.946
Troy, grab your guys.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.815
We're going
to open this up.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.053
What's happening?
Michelle, I need you
to stay out of range.

29:50.055 --> 29:52.289
I won't hide in there anymore.
He's my husband.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.191
You know what?

29:54.193 --> 29:55.993
You're right.
You're right.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.928
I want you to come with me.
I want you to hide

29:57.930 --> 29:59.496
behind the shields,
and I want you to stay close.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.839
All right, we ready?
We ready? Sam.

30:11.811 --> 30:14.044
Danny? Listen to me, man.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.979
Danny, Danny, don't do it!
Don't do it!

30:15.981 --> 30:17.514
Danny, put the gun down!

30:17.516 --> 30:20.384
Danny?!
Michelle's here!

30:20.386 --> 30:22.419
MICHELLE:
Daniel.
Michelle?

30:23.422 --> 30:25.322
What are you doing?

30:25.324 --> 30:26.857
You can't be here.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.392
Get out of here!
You shouldn't be here!

30:28.394 --> 30:29.960
I'm not going
anywhere, Daniel.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.195
Get her out of here!

30:31.197 --> 30:32.429
I'm not going anywhere!

30:32.431 --> 30:34.398
Don't make me do this
in front of her!

30:34.400 --> 30:35.465
Danny, just listen to me now.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.434
Get her out!
Get her out of here!

30:37.436 --> 30:39.169
Danny, put that gun down.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.504
We're not leaving
you, Danny!

30:40.506 --> 30:42.306
We're not leaving you!
(grunting)

30:42.308 --> 30:43.473
Go on!

30:45.477 --> 30:47.311
In five, four,

30:47.313 --> 30:48.178
three...
Three.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.380
two, one.
One.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.619
Fire in the hole.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.396
Hold fire.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.432
Hold fire.
Daniel!

31:08.434 --> 31:10.300
Please!
Michelle, he's not
going to hurt me.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.402
He's not going to hurt me.
Are you, Danny?

31:12.404 --> 31:13.904
Crossing the line.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.138
You think I won't do it?

31:15.140 --> 31:16.273
Cardinal rule.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.175
Gun's pointed at an officer.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.010
Huh?

31:20.012 --> 31:22.613
Sometimes you've got to break
the rules, Danny, remember?

31:22.615 --> 31:24.514
Remember who taught me that?

31:25.484 --> 31:26.984
I'll do it.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.585
I'll do it.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.121
I have the solution.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.322
Wordy, damn it, go.

31:35.961 --> 31:39.096
Hey. Hey.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.331
Hey. Hey, hey-hey.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.166
No, no. It's okay.

31:43.168 --> 31:46.136
It's okay.
It's okay.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.505
You know what
you've got to do.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.607
You've got to keep safe.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.045
You ever seen this before?

31:55.047 --> 31:57.447
Do you have any idea?
No. No.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.483
You're going to hide.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.652
(tape rewinding)
HARVEY:
It starts here.

32:01.654 --> 32:03.186
(clicking)

32:03.188 --> 32:05.055
(on tape):
...do what Jeremy told me to do.

32:05.057 --> 32:08.025
He told me to stay
under the bed.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.093
So I didn't see them.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.029
WOMAN (on tape):
But you think they
might have been

32:12.031 --> 32:13.563
the same men that had
come before?

32:13.565 --> 32:17.267
Don't know why they came back.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.704
'Cause he said we'd be okay.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.373
Who said you'd
be okay, Petra?

32:23.375 --> 32:25.676
The policeman
with the baseball cards.

32:25.678 --> 32:29.212
He, he said we'd be okay.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.682
Then he went away.

32:31.684 --> 32:34.418
But he didn't know that
they'd come back, Petra.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.486
But maybe he did.

32:38.357 --> 32:42.059
Because, because he told Jeremy.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.127
What do you mean,
"He told Jeremy"?

32:45.364 --> 32:48.065
He said, "You know what
you've got to do.

32:48.067 --> 32:51.134
You've got to be brave
and show your sisters."

32:52.371 --> 32:56.239
And so Jeremy
wanted to be brave

32:56.241 --> 32:59.509
so he could save me
and my sister.

32:59.511 --> 33:02.980
But it didn't work.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.048
It didn't work.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.023
Boss,

33:13.025 --> 33:14.458
we got something.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.493
Home invaders came back.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.495
Boy stepped up
to protect his sisters,

33:18.497 --> 33:19.730
Daniel and his team were done.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.565
Daniel didn't do anything wrong.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.000
It was something
he told the boy.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.134
Yeah, "You know
what you gotta do?

33:24.136 --> 33:25.535
You gotta hide."

33:25.537 --> 33:27.037
No, that's not what he said.

33:27.039 --> 33:28.472
He said, "You know
what you gotta do?

33:28.474 --> 33:32.109
You gotta show your sisters
you're brave."

33:36.515 --> 33:37.514
What was the boy's name?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.249
Jeremy.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.519
Okay, thanks.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.221
You hide like that.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.756
Daniel?

33:48.360 --> 33:50.260
Daniel?

33:53.599 --> 33:56.099
Shell, you got to go.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.136
You can't see this.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.470
Daniel, I'm not leaving you!

34:00.472 --> 34:03.407
Daniel, let's talk about Jeremy.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.311
Jeremy?

34:08.313 --> 34:10.614
The file you wanted.
I'm guessing

34:10.616 --> 34:12.582
it was about Jeremy, right?

34:12.584 --> 34:14.551
'Cause today's the day.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.387
Isn't it? August 8?

34:17.389 --> 34:19.489
It's funny those days
that stick in our minds.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.361
Guessing that Jeremy
was a pretty brave kid.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.530
But I don't know that for sure.

34:26.532 --> 34:30.133
Could you, could you
help me out with that one?

34:30.135 --> 34:31.535
Daniel?

34:34.206 --> 34:36.673
Danny, you can't do this.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.609
You can't do this without...
Without telling us why!

34:43.682 --> 34:45.549
I know...

34:47.719 --> 34:49.619
I know...

34:51.590 --> 34:54.324
about a kid

34:54.326 --> 34:55.759
sitting on the floor.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.230
I went back.

35:01.733 --> 35:06.636
He didn't look any different
from the last time we saw him.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.338
His eyes were open.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.739
He's looking at me,

35:09.741 --> 35:13.243
baseball cards
spread around him,

35:13.245 --> 35:16.680
but he's real quiet.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.448
He's real still
and I'm thinking,

35:18.450 --> 35:20.450
"Why is he so still?"

35:20.452 --> 35:23.854
"Why? Why doesn't he say, 'hi'?"

35:24.823 --> 35:27.724
Then I see it.

35:29.628 --> 35:33.597
He had a screwdriver
buried into his throat.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.298
And I put it there.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.900
You didn't put it there, Danny.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.535
Criminals put it there.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.736
If I hadn't

35:39.738 --> 35:41.638
been called there,

35:41.640 --> 35:44.341
I wouldn't have said that
to him.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.676
"You got to be brave
for your sisters."

35:46.678 --> 35:49.579
If it wasn't me,
he would've lived.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.715
You don't know that, buddy.

35:51.717 --> 35:52.716
(grunting)

35:52.718 --> 35:54.351
Danny...

35:56.555 --> 36:00.390
I spent my whole career
screwing up.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.494
Being too late, being too...

36:04.496 --> 36:08.565
early, not saying
the right words.

36:08.567 --> 36:12.402
I spent my whole career

36:12.404 --> 36:17.641
looking at the worst 20 minutes
of other people's lives

36:17.643 --> 36:19.342
and I can't take it anymore.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.545
Danny, how about remembering
the good stuff?

36:21.547 --> 36:23.480
The good stuff--
all the lives you saved.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.248
All the people whose
lives were made better,

36:25.250 --> 36:26.650
the lives that were made longer

36:26.652 --> 36:28.285
because you were there
for those 20 minutes.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.921
I can't remember, you see?

36:30.923 --> 36:33.924
I can't remember!
I can't remember!

36:33.926 --> 36:36.793
All I see are the ghosts.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.596
All I got are the ghosts.
The ghosts.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.666
I can't take it anymore.

36:42.668 --> 36:43.667
Daniel!

36:43.669 --> 36:45.802
Eddie...

36:46.772 --> 36:48.538
Please.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.842
Please help me.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.545
Pull the plug.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.218
Pull the plug.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.919
Okay, wait.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.556
No!

37:09.461 --> 37:12.362
Okay.

37:12.364 --> 37:15.298
Danny, this isn't about Jeremy.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.735
These guys think

37:18.737 --> 37:21.404
it's all about him,
but it's more than that.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.573
Isn't it?

37:24.543 --> 37:25.675
Jeremy's just...

37:25.677 --> 37:29.813
who we always think about.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.748
I get it.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.287
I get it.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.891
You know what, buddy?

37:41.893 --> 37:44.261
Every time...

37:44.263 --> 37:46.896
Every time I look
at a damn scope,

37:47.866 --> 37:51.868
I see a kid run across.

37:51.870 --> 37:55.305
I see a spray of blood.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.343
You know what else, Danny?

38:02.047 --> 38:04.848
You know what else I see?

38:04.850 --> 38:09.452
All the calls
we didn't get to in time.

38:10.722 --> 38:14.991
The mothers that
we couldn't talk down.

38:14.993 --> 38:20.764
The kid who thought it'd be fun
to pull a gun on a cop.

38:20.766 --> 38:23.867
You're not the only one
who sees ghosts, Danny.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.370
I got to tell you,

38:27.372 --> 38:29.973
I don't know where to put them
anymore either.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.042
Eddie, please, no.

38:32.044 --> 38:35.378
You taught me everything I know.

38:37.783 --> 38:41.651
You made me who I am, Danny.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.953
You can't...

38:43.955 --> 38:50.694
You can't tell me...
that this is how it ends.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.095
(sobbing)
You can't.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.031
Give me that gun.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.834
(sobbing):
No!

38:57.836 --> 39:00.804
Oh, God.

39:00.806 --> 39:03.406
It's gonna be okay.

39:03.408 --> 39:07.911
(sobbing)

39:08.980 --> 39:11.781
(Danny sobbing)

39:11.783 --> 39:14.718
(whispering):
Stand down. Stand down.

39:27.099 --> 39:29.032
It was harmless.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.533
They just wanted
to keep us busy.

39:35.674 --> 39:38.875
Inspector Stainton, those
witnesses are free to go.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.982
Hay and grass.

39:59.131 --> 40:00.997
I'm going to take
you to a place.

40:00.999 --> 40:04.033
A place I've been myself.
