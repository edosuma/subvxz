WEBVTT

00:39.665 --> 00:41.624
Betty, are you ready?

00:43.502 --> 00:44.919
It's stuck.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.547
What about now?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.258
Betty!

00:50.759 --> 00:52.260
I'II get it. Just go.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.098
Betty? The car is here.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.063
What's going on? We've got to go.

01:04.148 --> 01:06.733
DarIing, I just don't think I can go tonight.

01:07.526 --> 01:08.609
What's the matter?

01:09.486 --> 01:12.363
It's a woman's thing.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.866
Is there any way you couId pIay with pain?

01:15.909 --> 01:18.703
It's the Junior League of New York.
I don't want to do it without you.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.956
Your mother wiII be there.
It'II be very endearing.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.381
Forgive me on the way?

01:48.734 --> 01:49.859
Thank you.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.449
Say au revoir.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.788
Bonjour, Marie.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.124
Marie, I can't understand you.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.794
-Moustiques?
-Mosquitoes.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.842
We can't Iet Heinz beat us there.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.594
He has a name, you know.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.262
And do you know what that is?

02:18.347 --> 02:19.806
Are you kidding me?

02:19.890 --> 02:22.266
He's the onIy man
I want to pIease more than you.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.601
And your father.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.687
I'm the baby. They miss me.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.651
So, Megan, you're French. I suppose
I shouId ask you what Iooks good.

02:32.611 --> 02:36.364
I'm Canadian.
AIthough, for aII we know, they are, too.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.949
You know, back in Pittsburgh,

02:38.033 --> 02:40.409
everybody is pretty much
who you expect them to be.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.036
Or you know them forever.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.663
Raymond and I met in high schooI.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.082
WeII, then we've been
married Ionger than you.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.504
-I toId you he was smooth.
-How did you two meet?

02:54.049 --> 02:56.008
-WeII...
-At work.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.802
Don was divorced.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.722
WeII, that's none of my business.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.935
You have a teenage daughter, EmiIy.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.312
-How's her summer?
-It's tough.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.481
She's around the house aII the time.

03:10.566 --> 03:13.025
Too oId for camp, too young for a job.

03:13.110 --> 03:16.070
-I say Iet her enjoy it.
-I agree.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.406
You don't sound so happy about it
when I get home.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.409
WeII, the music is so Ioud.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.078
Do you know the RoIIing Stones, Don?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.247
-Sure.
-The Stones.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.208
She can't get enough of them.

03:29.293 --> 03:33.129
The other night, she's pIaying this song,
"Time, time is on your side..."

03:33.213 --> 03:36.090
-Time ls On My Side.
-Yes, it is, dear.

03:36.174 --> 03:40.803
WeII, it's catchy. And I was thinking,
what if they were to sing, you know,

03:40.888 --> 03:45.016
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz is on my side"?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.976
Or something Iike that. I don't know.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.313
They're gonna be in New York.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.816
EmiIy aImost jumped in our bags with us
when she heard we were coming.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.987
Maybe you couId, you know,
get them to record it whiIe they're here.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.742
WeII, that's not exactIy the way it works,
but we can certainIy approach them.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.369
This is boring. Am I right, Megan?

04:06.788 --> 04:07.955
Yes.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.589
CIara, where is Roger?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.925
Caroline says the meeting is in his office.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.098
-You wanted to see me?
-I was waiting in my office

04:26.183 --> 04:28.309
to give you some good news.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.853
Drinking good news?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.064
Mohawk caIIed.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.440
You're weIcome.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.611
They haven't informed their agency,
but I'm toId it's a matter of hours.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.321
WeIcome back, suckers.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.782
I think you shouId handIe the account.

04:42.908 --> 04:46.744
-So, they asked for me.
-They enjoy your company.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.664
And since you were here when they were
here, they think you know their business.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.749
I know Hank from the war. He Iikes vodka.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.001
Jack Iikes Jack. Anything eIse?

04:54.086 --> 04:58.589
So you're aware they've taken on
$54 miIIion in debt to repIace their pIanes

04:59.132 --> 05:00.591
and there's a mechanic strike Iooming?

05:00.676 --> 05:03.511
-AIthough they'II IikeIy be spared.
-So far, so good.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.930
Don and I have been
trying to expIain to Lane

05:06.014 --> 05:08.599
this is a daiIy business
and we'II need a dedicated copywriter.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.477
I don't understand
why Miss OIson can't handIe it.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.521
Because these guys are
gonna ask her to make drinks.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.690
We're stiII paying Don, aren't we?

05:15.774 --> 05:18.651
Don's not going to write IocaI fare ads
three times a week.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.152
That's aII it is?

05:20.237 --> 05:24.365
Just get a guy with basic retaiI experience
and run with it.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.701
CongratuIations.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.787
Lane, smiIe. We've got an airIine.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.292
Morning. I'm here to see Don.

05:35.377 --> 05:39.630
Yes, just a minute.
Mr. Draper, Mr. Crane to see you.

05:39.715 --> 05:40.798
Just a minute, Dawn.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.217
Is Don in a meeting?

05:43.301 --> 05:45.594
He's with Mrs. Draper.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.054
Thank you, Dawn.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.597
You're weIcome.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.018
It's so confusing.

05:52.227 --> 05:55.229
PeopIe keep saying that,
but we haven't had any probIems.

05:55.856 --> 05:59.859
You haven't. But out in the office,
it's reaIIy hard to teII who's who.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.408
-HeIIo, Harry.
-Good morning.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.497
Backstage, Forest HiIIs Tennis Stadium,
Saturday night,

06:13.582 --> 06:15.708
put your hands together
for the RoIIing Stones.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.543
And how wouId you gauge their interest?

06:17.627 --> 06:20.421
The manager sounded greedy.
I thought we'd take one car.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.673
-I'II drive.
-It starts at 8:00,

06:22.758 --> 06:25.217
but apparentIy they're aIways Iate.
I thought we couId grab a bite.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.262
There's a dynamite ItaIian restaurant
with a first-rate veaI parm.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.765
-Nope.
-Good.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.976
Then I wiII be ready at 7:30, having eaten.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.936
Have Dawn penciI it in.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.007
-HeIIo, PauIine.
-HeIIo, dear.

07:05.217 --> 07:08.094
I just wanted to see how you were feeIing.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.388
Aren't you sweet to
come aII the way over here

07:11.473 --> 07:13.015
when a phone caII wouId have sufficed.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.059
Are the chiIdren home?

07:15.143 --> 07:18.020
They're at day camp. You know that.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.940
Betty, you were soreIy missed Iast night.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.777
WeII, that's good to hear, I guess.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.987
You've missed a bunch of these, Betty.

07:28.615 --> 07:32.243
-PauIine...
-And I'm sure he never shows it,

07:32.327 --> 07:35.746
but it upsets Henry when you're not there.

07:35.831 --> 07:40.042
I want him to be happy.
And you being with him is part of that.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.170
I wasn't feeIing weII.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.757
Honey, I know how it happens.

07:47.384 --> 07:51.345
You get comfortabIe,
and you give up a IittIe bit,

07:51.429 --> 07:54.348
and then it just gets out of controI.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.852
There are things you can do about this.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.645
There are piIIs you can take.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.314
Why haven't you taken them?

08:04.568 --> 08:07.194
BeIieve me, I wouId if I couId.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.613
I have a heart condition.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.826
And honestIy, at my age,
I don't have to pIease men anymore.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.456
But you...

08:20.876 --> 08:24.461
Don't you want to get back into
that incredibIe cIoset of yours again?

08:31.011 --> 08:33.429
It'II be easy for you.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.931
You're just one of those girIs.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.607
Thank you, Dawn.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.652
-What's so funny?
-She was the most quaIified.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.657
We've got great news,
but assume this is for your ampIe ears onIy.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.743
Is it about Heinz and the RoIIing Stones?

08:55.911 --> 08:57.369
-What?
-No.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.496
Harry's such a Iiar.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.332
Baked beans and the RoIIing Stones.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.334
A cIient's idea if I ever heard one.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.252
Mohawk AirIines is returning.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.630
That's great. That's a big fish.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.590
It's a minnow, but it's our minnow.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.676
WeII, I obviousIy have experience,
I mean, at a Iow IeveI,

09:12.761 --> 09:13.719
but I saw how it worked.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.012
Your pIate is fuII,

09:15.096 --> 09:18.641
and, frankIy, Mohawk is going to
insist on a reguIar copywriter.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.644
-Someone with a penis.
-I'II work on that.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.021
CaII in books. You're the search committee.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.689
-Okay, when?
-ImmediateIy.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.524
Now, this is gonna be my account,

09:27.609 --> 09:30.694
so I don't want just some hack
with retaiI experience.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.197
He shouId be briIIiant and have awards.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.616
I want you to bring me
a good-Iooking version of Don.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.534
That'II be easy.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.791
-Mrs. Francis.
-HeIIo.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.960
So nice of you to see me so quickIy.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.795
WeII, sIow day.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.964
What seems to be the probIem?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.800
WeII, it's just that I've been wondering...

09:54.844 --> 09:56.887
I've put on a few pounds

09:56.972 --> 10:00.224
and I haven't had much Iuck
reducing on my own for some reason.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.936
WeII, with middIe-aged women, it gets easier
to put it on and harder to take it off.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.940
WeII,

10:08.233 --> 10:12.486
a friend toId me it'd be easier
if you gave me diet piIIs.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.657
Just to give me a IittIe jump-start.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.492
Is your friend a doctor?

10:20.161 --> 10:21.161
No.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.666
WeII, I'm not going to give you
a prescription without giving you an exam.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.668
What, for diet piIIs?

10:30.088 --> 10:31.797
If you think it's necessary.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.092
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife
has a rapid weight gain,

10:35.176 --> 10:37.386
the cause is usuaIIy psychoIogicaI.

10:38.471 --> 10:43.726
Unhappiness, anxiety, boredom,
things that cause us to Iose our seIf-controI.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.103
But first,

10:46.187 --> 10:49.773
we have to ruIe out
diabetes, hyperthyroidism...

10:49.858 --> 10:52.359
I don't need to take the piIIs forever.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.445
I don't Iike that.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.531
What?

10:59.743 --> 11:01.869
CouId you swaIIow?

11:07.709 --> 11:16.925
Henry!

11:17.719 --> 11:20.012
Mrs. Francis is on line one.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.770
-Betts, you there?
-Don.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.897
-I don't know what to do.
-About what?

11:29.981 --> 11:32.566
I went to the doctor this morning
and he found this thing.

11:32.650 --> 11:36.945
It's a node or a noduIe

11:37.030 --> 11:39.114
or something, and it's on my thyroid.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.826
And they don't know what it is,
but it's a Iump, Don.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.412
And he's sending me to the city
to some speciaIist for tests.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.706
Okay, okay, caIm down.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.792
I can't, Don. I can't.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.002
Betts, what exactIy did he say?

11:52.754 --> 11:55.005
Nothing. You know how they are.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.135
Do you want me to take the kids?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.472
The kids.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.725
The kids. Oh, God.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.062
Birdie.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.608
Say what you aIways say.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.821
Everything's gonna be okay.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.156
Okay.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.283
Bye-bye.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.800
If I see one more VoIkswagen ad
with something eIse in it...

12:41.386 --> 12:46.014
You can do an ad on anything you want.
Don't pick toiIet paper, shitbird.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.435
Too fat.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.562
Too thin.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.773
SheIIy Parker.
Might be a woman, God forbid.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.906
Irony. That's promising.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.834
Have I Iost my sense of smeII,
or is this good?

13:18.089 --> 13:19.590
That's bitching.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.800
What's this guy's name?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.262
"MichaeI Ginsberg."

13:26.014 --> 13:27.764
Nice knowing you, Mike.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.892
What are you doing?
That's the best one I've seen.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.102
This is why girIs don't pIay sports.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.438
You've been working on Heinz
for four months.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.940
Somebody eIse is gonna
carry the baII across the goaI Iine?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.609
Bringing him in for Mohawk.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.278
I hope you Iike him.
He's gonna be your boss someday.

13:41.404 --> 13:44.198
I Iike working with taIented peopIe.
It inspires me.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.743
I'm not taIking about me.
I'm taIking about another writer.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.703
Are you suddenIy not competitive?

13:49.787 --> 13:53.040
The chick who races peopIe to the toiIet?

13:53.625 --> 13:54.958
I'm going to bring him in.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.504
Stick to mediocre. You'II sIeep better.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.394
Can I come in?

14:14.479 --> 14:15.646
Of course.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.360
I just got off the phone with Jim.
He said tomorrow at 1 1 :00.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.071
Tomorrow?

14:24.322 --> 14:25.739
My boss made a caII.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.909
You toId Mayor Lindsay?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.328
He's got bigger secrets than this, Betty.

14:33.748 --> 14:36.416
-I don't know if tomorrow...
-You want to wait on this?

14:37.835 --> 14:40.963
-WeII, if it is something...
-If, if, if.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.257
Betty, Iet's not pIay that game, okay?

14:46.094 --> 14:47.719
Come to bed.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.180
You want some brandy?

14:54.310 --> 14:56.895
I see you aII the time. You're beautifuI.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.730
You're sweet.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.202
I'm gonna have a brandy.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.084
Betty.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.421
Betty Draper. I aImost didn't recognize you.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.090
Joyce, heIIo. How are you?

15:25.174 --> 15:27.634
Not good. I'm here.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.513
Mrs. Francis, the doctor's waiting.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.015
It's Francis now.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.891
My husband's name is Henry, too, actuaIIy.

15:35.685 --> 15:36.977
Look, you know what?

15:37.061 --> 15:38.812
I'm gonna be in radioIogy forever.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.189
Mrs. DarIing, they're waiting for you, too.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.358
Why are you here?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.819
You want to get some Iunch after?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.739
I don't know. My husband's picking me up.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.283
You think you don't want to
have Iunch, but you do.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.578
Okay.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.747
Okay, okay. I'm going.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.963
HeIIo. I'm Peggy OIson.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.966
MichaeI Ginsberg. Lead the way.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.843
No, we're meeting here.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.848
So what's he Iike?
Is he Iike a firm handshake kind of guy?

16:15.683 --> 16:17.225
-Excuse me?
-Don.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.478
I want to make a good impression.
You couId heIp me out.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.147
No, I'm interviewing you. I'm a copywriter.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.857
Have a seat.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.737
So, is Don stopping by?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.280
No, it's just me.

16:31.282 --> 16:34.618
-Can you hire me?
-WeII, no, but I'm the first round.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.621
WouIdn't you want to taIk to
the person who couId hire you?

16:38.289 --> 16:42.167
I spent three weeks dancing at that
crappy New York sateIIite of Leo Burnett.

16:42.251 --> 16:46.296
Never met him at aII.
Turns out Leo's not a reaI person.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.840
-Yes, he is.
-Is Don a reaI person?

16:48.925 --> 16:50.467
'Cause I'd reaIIy Iike to meet him.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.720
I'm the person
you need to impress right now.

16:54.389 --> 16:58.016
You Iooked at my book.
What more can I say?

16:59.769 --> 17:01.395
Okay.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.107
-I Iiked your work.
-And I Iike your work.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.901
You thought I was a secretary.
Do you have a current resume?

17:16.077 --> 17:18.704
-AIIen Ginsberg?
-He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.914
I figured we got to be reIated somehow.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.417
And what's he gonna say?

17:24.502 --> 17:27.045
Okay, weII, it was nice meeting you.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.716
Nuts. Listen, my stuff is good.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.260
You can see advertising ain't my day job.

17:34.262 --> 17:37.055
Look, you're a fair woman.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.641
I insuIted you because I'm honest.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.269
And I apoIogized because I'm brave.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.690
I didn't pick this profession. It picked me.
I didn't have any controI over it.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.318
Turns out it's the onIy thing I can do.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.280
-Your work's very impressive, but...
-Here's some other advantages...

17:53.364 --> 17:56.366
I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.410
I'm one of those peopIe
who taIks back to the radio.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.788
No girIfriend, no famiIy. I wiII Iive here.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.665
Then you're Iike everyone eIse.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.753
I've never been accused of that,
but I reaIIy am trying.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.591
I don't know.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.885
You can't act Iike this with Don.

18:15.553 --> 18:16.595
Like what?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.934
-We'II caII you.
-Okay.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.151
You know, your book
reaIIy does have a voice.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.903
That's what they said about Mein Kampf.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.696
The kid reaIIy has a voice.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.497
-You're sure you're okay just with tea?
-Yes.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.749
Everything tastes Iike sawdust to me.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.002
Everything stiII tastes good to me.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.838
Turns out I have the onIy kind
that makes you fatter.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.090
Look, I'm sure you're fine.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.592
When do you find out the resuIts?

18:58.763 --> 19:00.138
I don't remember.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.849
It wasn't untiI the third visit that I knew.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.851
Because Hank was waiting there.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.396
Have you toId your chiIdren?

19:09.273 --> 19:10.816
They know I'm going to the doctor a Iot,

19:10.900 --> 19:15.695
and they know I'm sick,
but I've aIways been in a bad mood, so...

19:16.948 --> 19:20.116
I joke with Hank.
He shouId just teII them I got hit by a car.

19:20.201 --> 19:23.078
It'd be easier to
deaI with than saying goodbye.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.497
The scene.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.544
I'm Ieaving behind such a mess.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.130
You're not going anywhere.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.758
He's my second husband.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.303
His mother's domineering.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.389
And Don's girIfriend...

19:42.974 --> 19:45.475
WeII, they're married.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.394
She's 20 years oId.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.647
They'II never hear
a nice word about me again.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.238
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.369
What is it Iike?

20:09.292 --> 20:11.084
WeII,

20:12.753 --> 20:15.589
it's Iike you're way out in the ocean,

20:15.673 --> 20:18.133
aIone, and you're paddIing,

20:19.260 --> 20:23.346
and you see peopIe on the shore,
but they're getting farther and farther away.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.225
And you struggIe because it's naturaI.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.520
Then your mind wanders
back to everything normaI.

20:30.605 --> 20:34.107
What am I gonna fix for dinner?
Did I Iock the back door?

20:36.027 --> 20:38.612
And then you just get so tired,

20:38.696 --> 20:43.283
you just give in
and hope you go straight down.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.288
That's horribIe.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.249
No one's ever asked.

20:54.003 --> 20:58.131
HeIIo, Iadies.
I am CeciIIia, and I have the gift of sight.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.467
CouId I offer you a reading?

21:01.177 --> 21:03.595
You're gonna predict our future?

21:03.679 --> 21:06.389
-Go ahead.
-ReaIIy?

21:06.474 --> 21:08.767
It's aIways good.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.486
-Oh, my.
-What?

21:19.654 --> 21:22.280
You're a great souI.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.532
You mean so much
to the peopIe around you.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.787
You're a rock.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.332
I'm sorry.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.168
We're done. Thank you.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.841
You need some more tea.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.105
-Are you okay?
-I had drinks with Mohawk.

21:55.189 --> 21:58.108
I sat down with two of them
and I swear by the end there were three.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.235
Did you hire him?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.737
No, he was crazy. I'm caIIing in more books.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.864
Define crazy for a copywriter.

22:04.949 --> 22:09.285
SIeeps aII day, disrespectfuI of authority,
drunk haIf the time. Did he smeII Iike pee?

22:09.370 --> 22:11.955
-Who smeIIs Iike pee?
-Writers. Just hire him.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.249
I can't. Don wiII hate him. He's certifiabIe.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.001
I order you to bring him in.

22:17.294 --> 22:19.212
You have to. I aIready toId Mohawk.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.588
Why wouId you do that?

22:20.673 --> 22:23.258
I wanted to smooth the ground
about working with a Jew.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.594
Turns out everybody's got one now.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.888
TeII you the truth,
it makes the agency more modern.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.434
Between that and it's aIways darkest
before the dawn over there.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.227
At Ieast this one we're hiring on purpose.

22:34.395 --> 22:37.022
I can find another Jew,
if that's what you care about.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.065
Look, I know what you're afraid of.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.984
Sweetheart, no one's gonna repIace you.

22:41.152 --> 22:44.362
I'm not threatened by his taIent.
He's not that good.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.573
I just think Don wiII hate him,
and then he'II hate me.

22:48.242 --> 22:50.910
I'II be there. I'II handIe Don.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.423
-How can you hear anything?
-I'm foIIowing your advice.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.717
I'm being bathed in commerciaIs.

23:06.969 --> 23:09.763
My God, you're so square,
you've got corners.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.474
I have to make sure I Iook Iike the man.

23:15.853 --> 23:19.773
If Betty caIIs, you know, or the kids,
teII them I'II caII them in the morning.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.608
What did she want anyway?

23:21.692 --> 23:23.568
Who knows?

23:23.652 --> 23:25.487
WeII, have fun.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.364
And I don't mean that.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.457
This is backstage. That's the reaI backstage.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.964
Nice to see you.

23:45.549 --> 23:48.051
-We're here to see the RoIIing Stones.
-They're not here.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.470
WeII, actuaIIy, we're here to
see their manager, AIIen KIein.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.556
-He's not here either.
-I'm Harry Crane. I'm on the Iist.

23:53.641 --> 23:54.891
There's no Iist.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.102
WiII you Iet us know when they get here?

23:57.478 --> 23:59.604
Sir, I promise you'II know.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.400
ShouId have taIked him
out of this at the dinner tabIe.

24:04.485 --> 24:07.612
WeII, we either wait for them to show up
or wait for them to come out of there.

24:09.365 --> 24:12.700
Hey, mister, teII your friend I'II trade him
a joint for a cigarette.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.078
You can have one for free.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.539
No, I just wanted to make sure
you guys weren't cops.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.084
Can you Iight this for me?

24:21.168 --> 24:23.586
-There's a cop right over there.
-He's cooI.

24:28.676 --> 24:31.094
-What are you doing?
-They're cooI.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.595
They don't Iook cooI.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.771
-What are you two doing here?
-We're here on business.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.774
-What kind of business?
-Advertising.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.693
Like Bewitched?

24:47.111 --> 24:51.614
You're Derwood and he's Mr. Kravitz.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.059
Are you sure you want to?

25:22.062 --> 25:23.897
It's been too Iong.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.734
I thought that's what you wanted.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.537
You know who has the best stuff?

25:39.622 --> 25:42.081
-CharIton Heston.
-Who's that?

25:42.708 --> 25:46.002
We went to his house, he came out naked.

25:46.629 --> 25:48.004
He's a very good-Iooking man.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.466
I guess if I Iooked Iike that,
I wouId be naked a Iot, too.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.718
In fairness,
I don't think he knew we were there.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.095
It was kind of an impromptu meeting.

25:56.597 --> 25:59.224
We wanted him to be the voice of VapoRub.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.559
Right? WouIdn't that be perfect?

26:01.644 --> 26:03.853
She just said she doesn't know who he is.

26:03.938 --> 26:06.356
Come on, they're Ietting us in.
I toId them how important you are.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.191
-Thank you.
-No, just HaroId.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.610
-Who'd you teII them I was?
-Just go.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.947
Hey, he's getting me in, not you.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.990
I'II send for you.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.412
She knows what she's doing.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.958
You reaIIy think
you're gonna get the RoIIing Stones

26:25.042 --> 26:28.044
-to do a TV ad?
-They did one for cereaI in EngIand.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.380
It must have been a Iong time ago.

26:30.589 --> 26:34.926
It was three years ago.
When you were probabIy, what, 1 1 ?

26:45.187 --> 26:46.938
You see someone do that in a movie?

26:47.773 --> 26:49.983
You need to reIax.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.154
So what do you Iike so much
about the RoIIing Stones?

26:56.240 --> 26:59.284
Why don't you get me backstage
and you'II see?

27:02.371 --> 27:05.832
What do you feeI when you hear them?

27:07.668 --> 27:09.168
Brian Jones.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.171
He's a troubadour.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.926
So you feeI romantic.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.804
God, you're Iike a psychiatrist.

27:20.848 --> 27:22.849
What do you know about psychiatrists?

27:28.188 --> 27:32.608
Do you have a business card
or something I couId try on the doorman?

27:54.757 --> 27:55.882
I'II make breakfast.

27:56.258 --> 28:00.511
If, if, if.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.561
You know what? I am hungry.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.195
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.008
So what do you think? They gonna show?

28:39.093 --> 28:42.553
Stop Iooking at your watch.
They're gonna come when they come.

28:42.638 --> 28:47.016
They're gonna come right down that haIIway
and I'm gonna jump on Brian Iike Jack Ruby.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.435
And what do you expect to happen?

28:49.728 --> 28:51.813
I'II get into that dressing room

28:51.897 --> 28:55.608
and I'm gonna stare at him
whiIe he tunes his guitar.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.069
He'II see me from across the room.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.280
I'm Lady Jane. He'II know that.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.282
Then what are you gonna do?

29:03.742 --> 29:06.160
I don't know. Whatever he wants.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.579
And what do you think he wants?

29:09.581 --> 29:13.209
None of you want any of us to have
a good time just 'cause you never did.

29:13.293 --> 29:16.963
No, we're worried about you.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.551
Got it! I got it!

29:21.885 --> 29:24.470
They want to do it.
I have never seen peopIe more excited.

29:24.555 --> 29:25.805
Wait, you met them?

29:25.889 --> 29:28.266
-They're here. They're here.
-They're here.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.237
Who were you taIking to?

29:42.698 --> 29:45.533
They even sounded just Iike them
when they were singing.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.035
They pIayed for me.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.456
I'm sorry I faiIed, Don.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.583
We can try again tomorrow. Asbury Park?

29:53.959 --> 29:56.043
Forget it. Manager Iooked right through us.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.089
You want the Iast one?

30:00.174 --> 30:01.799
There were 20.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.177
I thought you were getting it for your famiIy.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.846
You know what? Let them get their own.

30:07.556 --> 30:11.309
You bring home a bag of food and they
go at it, and there's nothing Ieft for you.

30:11.393 --> 30:12.602
Eat first.

30:12.686 --> 30:15.730
That's my recommendation to peopIe who
say they're getting married and having kids.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.356
Eat first.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.360
-Sure you don't want it?
-Harry, you have to go.

30:21.904 --> 30:24.780
Just Iet me sit here for a second.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.242
I have to get home.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.664
Those girIs, Don.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.167
Those young girIs.

30:36.919 --> 30:38.878
They are so much fun.

30:38.962 --> 30:42.048
Everybody's having fun.
They're aII on drugs.

30:42.132 --> 30:43.716
You're on drugs.

30:44.426 --> 30:47.053
You signed the Tradewinds.
Who the heII are they?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.223
Just go inside.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.309
What are we gonna teII Raymond?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.561
That the RoIIing Stones
aren't good for Heinz.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.647
Yeah.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.315
His daughterjust probabIy
wanted to meet them.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.527
I don't think they're good for her, either.

31:06.073 --> 31:09.450
I'm gonna Ieave the bag.
Jennifer has me on a diet.

31:12.162 --> 31:14.539
-We shouId do this again.
-Bye, Harry.

31:28.095 --> 31:31.097
I waited as Iong as I couId,
but we've got to go.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.478
ReaIIy?

31:37.563 --> 31:39.063
Drink too much with the Stones?

31:39.523 --> 31:42.984
No, we didn't get to meet them.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.988
WeII, you'II have pIenty of time to teII me.
It takes forever to get to Fire IsIand.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.616
Did Betty caII?

31:51.493 --> 31:53.369
No. Let's go.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.204
Megan.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.333
What?

32:04.256 --> 32:05.923
I have to teII you something.

32:07.676 --> 32:10.344
-What happened?
-It's Betty.

32:11.471 --> 32:14.640
She might be sick. ReaIIy sick.

32:15.767 --> 32:16.851
What?

32:17.769 --> 32:19.645
They found a tumor.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.315
That's terribIe.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.318
Why didn't you teII me?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.070
I didn't know how you'd react.

32:28.822 --> 32:31.073
What, did you think I'd be happy?

32:31.158 --> 32:34.327
I don't know what I thought.
I just knew she wouIdn't want you to know.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.912
WeII, it affects me.

32:37.164 --> 32:40.041
There's a possibiIity that it's nothing.

32:40.334 --> 32:42.918
And if it's something, we'II deaI with it.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.587
-You know I Iove SaIIy, and...
-No, no, no.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.714
I don't want to have that conversation.

32:48.675 --> 32:51.677
Great. Then Iet's go.
Your trunks on the dresser.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.304
No.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.017
I just can't.

32:59.853 --> 33:01.937
Megan, you are 26 years oId.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.190
So I don't understand death?

33:05.651 --> 33:08.027
I understand you went to
that concert Iast night,

33:08.111 --> 33:12.031
but now it's suddenIy too overwheIming
when we're supposed to go see my friends.

33:19.206 --> 33:21.040
Come on.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.667
There's nothing you can do.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.837
It's okay.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.878
This is very provocative.

34:08.130 --> 34:11.006
That one. I was at the movies.

34:11.425 --> 34:14.510
WeII, not the movies.
I was in Times Square at a peep show.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.346
-ShouIdn't we wait for Roger?
-For what?

34:17.431 --> 34:19.765
He doesn't even come to the meetings
that are important.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.393
-Go on.
-There's a resume in there.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.604
Okay.

34:29.901 --> 34:33.529
So you were at Needham for a Iong time
and a Iot of other pIaces for a short time.

34:33.613 --> 34:36.115
I checked his references thoroughIy
or I wouIdn't have brought him in.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.783
WouId you Iet him taIk?

34:40.537 --> 34:43.414
I'm opinionated,
but I know if you were my boss,

34:43.498 --> 34:46.500
I wouId have no probIem saying,
"Okay, Don."

34:46.877 --> 34:50.254
UnIess you want me to caII you Mr. Draper.
I worked for someone Iike that.

34:50.964 --> 34:53.632
-Kirk Whitby?
-I'm not gonna say.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.428
You wouIdn't want me running
aII over town teIIing your secrets.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.930
WeII, I wouIdn't want you
grumbIing behind my back, either.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.932
You're right. I shouIdn't have said that.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.934
I just wanted to make you smiIe.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.521
I'II be honest.

35:08.190 --> 35:09.940
I've admired you since the Ietter.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.902
I thought it was the funniest thing
I ever read.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.822
And the fact that I can say "The Ietter"
and everyone knows what I'm taIking about.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.659
I just want to be a part of this pIace.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.286
I think it's on the way up.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.497
Between you and Margaret,

35:25.582 --> 35:27.374
she's very interesting.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.668
And I think I made it cIear, so are you.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.176
PIeasure to meet you, MichaeI.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.522
Good work.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.649
Thanks.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.360
Promise me you didn't just
hire the handsomest one.

35:55.028 --> 35:56.445
Anything eIse?

35:56.530 --> 35:58.656
Get him set up and Iet him haggIe with Lane.

36:06.373 --> 36:08.916
Roger, I see you've met Mr. Ginsberg.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.461
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of
throwing something through this window.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.006
-How'd it go?
-Good.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.634
See? I'm proud of you.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.886
Mr. Ginsberg, foIIow me.

36:27.143 --> 36:30.688
I'm sorry. My stomach rumbIes sometimes
and it can sound Iike the "F" word.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.439
You know, I thought you were crazy
when I met you,

36:32.524 --> 36:35.651
and you have confirmed it by
not acting the way that you acted with me.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.319
You toId me not to act that way.

36:37.404 --> 36:40.197
And the fact that you can controI it
reaIIy scares me.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.909
So I'm not getting the job?

36:43.994 --> 36:46.412
No, you start tomorrow.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.377
I wouId Iike to pick you up
and spin you around right now,

36:53.461 --> 36:55.296
but I don't want peopIe to think
that's how I got the job.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.339
WeII, I'm gIad you're excited.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.427
Come on, be proud of me. I need it.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.471
Nobody in the worId cares
I got the job but you.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.181
Then I'm happy.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.766
I can't beIieve this.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.280
You shouId have just gone into work.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.698
Come on.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.910
-Do you want me to turn down the TV?
-It's fine.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.203
Henry Francis.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.040
WeII, teII Jim
His Honor is not going to Michigan.

37:31.917 --> 37:35.294
Because Romney's a cIown
and I don't want him standing next to him.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.969
Because he's got a city to run.

37:44.054 --> 37:45.721
Can we taIk Iater?

37:51.978 --> 37:53.646
Francis residence.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.440
This is Betty.

37:57.817 --> 38:01.487
Okay.

38:03.740 --> 38:04.823
Yes.

38:06.993 --> 38:09.161
Thank you for getting back to me so quickIy.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.373
Okay.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.166
Goodbye.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.386
It's benign.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.182
I knew it.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.522
I'm so happy.

38:40.694 --> 38:42.569
You're okay, you know.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.990
I feeI Iike I just got off a boat from China.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.703
Hey, everything's okay.

38:51.705 --> 38:53.998
No, it's good. It's good.

38:55.333 --> 38:59.128
It's nice to be put through the wringer
and find out I'm just fat.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.296
Betty, come on.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.549
You're exhausted.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.010
That's what it is, isn't it?

39:08.179 --> 39:10.055
I don't know how many ways to teII you,

39:10.974 --> 39:12.307
but I don't see it.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.309
I know.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.021
-Your mother's obese.
-Hey.

39:17.939 --> 39:21.108
Listen to me, I feeI Iike I've been given a gift.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.152
Like Scrooge seeing his tombstone.

39:23.236 --> 39:26.405
Oh, my God, this is what it couId be.
But it's not gonna be.

39:41.004 --> 39:42.629
Saturday night was fun.

39:42.714 --> 39:43.964
Okay.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.310
I'd Iike to say that I've gathered you aII here

39:56.394 --> 39:59.354
so you may remember
how smaII this agency once was.

40:01.024 --> 40:05.277
Mohawk AirIines has chosen to return
to SterIing Cooper Draper Pryce.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.534
Now, now.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.704
I'm just pIeased that after a Iong effort,
I was abIe to sign them.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.916
I've aIso hired a new copywriter

40:19.000 --> 40:21.210
and Iook forward to great success,
with your heIp.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.674
And, of course, Mr. SterIing
wiII be handIing the day to day.

40:27.759 --> 40:31.929
But rest assured,
everything he knows, I'II know.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.271
You gonna break that over its nose?

40:43.316 --> 40:45.150
Forget everything I said before.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.820
-Excuse me?
-That's the Iast guy I hired.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.738
Hey.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.333
-Roger.
-What?

41:03.336 --> 41:06.547
LittIe prick dangIed it in front of me
and took it away.

41:08.091 --> 41:09.508
It was disrespectfuI.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.427
You know, I used to Iove that kid.

41:12.512 --> 41:14.513
I wouId hoId his hand
and heIp him up on the swing set.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.349
He grew up.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.977
-What did you expect?
-I'm tired of it, Don.

41:21.020 --> 41:24.565
I'm tired of trying to prove I stiII have
any vaIue around here.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.943
I'm exhausted from hanging onto the Iedge
and having

41:28.027 --> 41:30.445
some kid's foot on my fingertips.

41:31.573 --> 41:33.282
Bombs away.

41:37.704 --> 41:39.329
Betty has cancer.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.376
ReaIIy?

41:46.254 --> 41:47.713
I don't know.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.590
They're waiting on tests.

41:51.301 --> 41:52.718
WeII, that wouId soIve everything.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.055
You want me to make a caII?

41:59.475 --> 42:01.560
She probabIy knows aIready.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.729
I'm the one that has to caII.

42:05.607 --> 42:06.732
She's a fighter.

42:07.734 --> 42:08.942
Come on.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.825
I just imagine them
growing up without a mother.

42:18.578 --> 42:19.703
I never had one.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.288
Megan wiII try,

42:22.040 --> 42:23.332
but what are they gonna do?

42:24.542 --> 42:26.335
How does that end up?

42:26.711 --> 42:28.587
ActuaI Iife and death.

42:29.923 --> 42:31.340
I've given up on that.

42:33.301 --> 42:34.927
I can't do that.

42:44.604 --> 42:46.563
When is everything
gonna get back to normaI?

43:06.209 --> 43:08.835
-Henry Francis.
-Hi, Henry. It's Don.

43:10.255 --> 43:11.630
HeIIo, Don.

43:14.509 --> 43:18.262
I wanted to know if there was any news

43:18.888 --> 43:20.055
about Betty.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.891
I didn't reaIize she...

43:23.685 --> 43:25.519
She's fine. She's out of the woods.

43:29.482 --> 43:31.733
-WeII, that's great news.
-It is.

43:32.485 --> 43:34.444
You know, we're about
to put supper on the tabIe.

43:35.488 --> 43:36.738
I'II Iet you go.

43:40.785 --> 43:41.994
Who was it?

43:43.371 --> 43:44.788
Nobody.

43:59.846 --> 44:01.221
Betty's fine.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.515
I'm gIad to hear it.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.268
You're such an optimist.

44:07.687 --> 44:10.188
She just needs to have
something to caII you about.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.193
Take you to dinner?

44:15.528 --> 44:16.778
Sure.

44:32.462 --> 44:34.546
Pete Fox died.
