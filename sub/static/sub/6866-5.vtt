WEBVTT

00:01.520 --> 00:04.489
Oh! Oh, I cannot believe you.

00:04.657 --> 00:07.820
Are you out of your big fat Russian skull?

00:07.993 --> 00:09.984
Of all the dumb stunts you've...

00:10.162 --> 00:12.096
Nikolai, how could you do this?

00:12.264 --> 00:17.725
- With KGB surveillance team. They...
- Not "how" how, you ass. "Why" how.

00:17.903 --> 00:20.394
For record of activities in Krakow.

00:20.573 --> 00:23.133
Oh, some blurry eight-millimeter of...

00:23.309 --> 00:25.504
No, we have the digital hi-def now.

00:25.678 --> 00:28.875
Wonderful. So they can blow it up
for the jury at my treason trial.

00:29.048 --> 00:31.539
Is amazing, no loss of resolution...

00:31.717 --> 00:34.117
Damn your bloodshot eyes, I'm serious.

00:34.286 --> 00:35.981
I will not let that happen to you.

00:36.155 --> 00:39.454
You let this happen. And by doing so,
jeopardized our entire operation.

00:39.625 --> 00:42.287
Darling, please. Don't say that.

00:42.461 --> 00:44.827
I have no idea how this Ramón Limón...

00:44.997 --> 00:47.898
<i>... got the disk. He must have gone rogue.</i>

00:48.067 --> 00:50.831
Oh, all Hispanics look roguish.

00:51.003 --> 00:53.028
The KGB had no idea about my plan.

00:53.205 --> 00:55.503
So please, do not blame Major Jakov.

00:55.674 --> 00:57.005
Oh, right, how could I?

00:57.176 --> 01:00.407
The important thing is that
the disk does not fall into the wrong hands.

01:00.579 --> 01:03.810
- You mean "wronger" hands.
- Like your government's. Or mine.

01:03.983 --> 01:07.885
I find it very surprising
that Castro okayed an operation...

01:08.053 --> 01:11.147
with such potential
to embarrass the Soviets.

01:11.323 --> 01:13.291
Well, he is unpredictable.

01:13.459 --> 01:17.259
Which is why I am planning ahead
for my retirement. In beautiful Miami.

01:17.429 --> 01:20.091
And so, here are the keys and the deed...

01:20.266 --> 01:22.257
to my condo in South Beach.

01:22.434 --> 01:25.198
A nice start to a new start.

01:25.371 --> 01:27.271
But what of the financial arrangements?

01:27.439 --> 01:31.034
You'll get the money when I get the disk.
And if you've made copies...

01:31.210 --> 01:35.112
I tried, but the Russian was smart
enough to copy-protect the disk.

01:35.281 --> 01:36.942
Yeah, he's a real genius.

01:37.116 --> 01:39.482
But if you try to double-cross me...

01:39.652 --> 01:41.381
Well, you should know what...

01:42.154 --> 01:44.679
kind of a man you are...

01:44.857 --> 01:47.018
dealing with.
- Oh, Ramón.

01:47.192 --> 01:49.717
I think I know exactly
what kind of man you are.

01:49.895 --> 01:50.919
<i>Uh, que?</i>

01:51.096 --> 01:54.293
I said I could eat
the absolute pants off some shrimp.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.898 --> 02:28.025
I don't suppose he's up.
No, mum.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.000
And from the looks of it,
not to mention the lemur...

02:32.171 --> 02:34.298
I would hazard
he's taking a personal day.

02:34.473 --> 02:36.338
The hell he is.

02:36.508 --> 02:37.998
Woodhouse, we got any lube?

02:38.177 --> 02:39.872
Like at this point even olive oil would...

02:41.513 --> 02:43.447
help me get that drawer unstuck.

02:43.615 --> 02:46.516
Jesus God, Sterling. Schoolgirls?

02:46.685 --> 02:49.119
- Those are costumes.
- I suppose that makes it better?

02:49.288 --> 02:52.382
Doesn't it? Oh, uh, Woodhouse,
I told my guests you'd pack their lunch.

02:52.558 --> 02:56.085
I'll do my best, sir. I'm afraid
the lemur got into the pudding cups.

02:56.261 --> 03:00.129
- Yeah, like I told you he would. You idiot.
- Will you please focus?

03:00.299 --> 03:02.767
Now, I know you're familiar
with the honey pot.

03:02.935 --> 03:05.836
Seducing and blackmailing
a hot female enemy agent.

03:06.004 --> 03:07.665
I love the honey pot.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.239
I'm sure you do.

03:09.408 --> 03:11.899
But this time you may not
find the target...

03:12.077 --> 03:14.272
appealing.
- What, is it Pam?

03:14.446 --> 03:17.210
Seriously, whoever.
It's all the same in the dar... No.

03:17.383 --> 03:19.817
- Yes. Yes. Yes!
- No. No. Come on.

03:19.985 --> 03:23.512
- Have Gillette do this.
- Sterling, you're the only one I can trust.

03:23.689 --> 03:26.522
And don't even get me
started on Miss Gillette.

03:26.692 --> 03:29.024
She has never liked me.

03:29.194 --> 03:32.288
But someday I'm gonna
write a book about this place. Mm-hm.

03:32.464 --> 03:34.329
A real smackarooni.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.162
Sterling, please, I need your help.

03:37.336 --> 03:39.804
This Ramón Limón is blackmailing me.

03:39.972 --> 03:42.167
- With what? What's he got on you?
- It's...

03:42.341 --> 03:45.970
none of your nosy beeswax.
- Well, then it sucks to be you.

03:46.145 --> 03:49.546
You'll be who it sucks to be
if I have to call my bridge partner.

03:49.715 --> 03:51.307
Oh, who's your bridge partner?

03:51.483 --> 03:53.383
- The district attorney.
- So?

03:53.552 --> 03:57.648
Sir, that stolen lemur bit one
of your prostitutes right in the face...

03:57.823 --> 03:59.814
and she says she can't go to hospital...

03:59.992 --> 04:03.155
because she's, quote, "tripping balls."

04:04.863 --> 04:08.663
You know, when I was little,
I used to pretend you weren't my mother.

04:08.834 --> 04:10.392
<i>- Me too.
Bang.</i>

04:10.569 --> 04:11.934
Bang.

04:12.104 --> 04:14.334
Ew, kill. Bang.

04:14.506 --> 04:16.531
- Shock.
- Shut up. Oh, my God, bang.

04:16.708 --> 04:19.370
- I hesitate to even ask.
- We're doing "Kill, Bang, Marry."

04:19.545 --> 04:22.105
- Again, hesitation.
- It's on the ISIS Intranet.

04:22.281 --> 04:26.012
You click through pictures of everybody
who works here, and say if you'd rather...

04:26.185 --> 04:30.246
- Kill them or bang or marry them.
- Wow, that is entirely inappropriate.

04:30.422 --> 04:32.947
That's what I said.
If you go through the whole list...

04:33.125 --> 04:35.116
you can see what everybody said.

04:35.294 --> 04:39.060
- Everybody? Like...?
- Like Lana. And if, I don't know...

04:39.231 --> 04:41.722
maybe she said "bang"
about Mr. Archer?

04:41.900 --> 04:43.629
- I got ups. Move it, chubs.
- Hey.

04:43.802 --> 04:46.794
Dr. Krieger's covert team
installed these surveillance cameras...

04:46.972 --> 04:48.940
while Limón was out
shopping yesterday.

04:49.107 --> 04:51.041
Yup, we've got video and audio...

04:51.210 --> 04:53.872
with a satellite feed
back to these hard drives.

04:54.246 --> 04:56.612
- Same set-up I've got in my van.
- Jesus, Krieger.

04:56.782 --> 05:00.274
- You're still taping bum fights?
- No, now I'm into something...

05:00.452 --> 05:02.079
darker.
- Ahem!

05:02.254 --> 05:04.051
Since that obnoxious little Castro...

05:04.223 --> 05:06.885
is such a raging homophobe...
- Fidel hates the gays.

05:07.059 --> 05:11.018
It's a safe bet he'd have Ramón killed
if he ever found out he was gay.

05:11.196 --> 05:13.255
- So once you seduce him...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:13.432 --> 05:15.900
I thought nobody else
was supposed to know about this.

05:16.068 --> 05:18.161
- He won't remember.
- Yeah, no, I'm...

05:18.337 --> 05:21.431
<i>- I am shitfaced.
Miss Archer, phone call.</i>

05:21.607 --> 05:23.700
<i>- I'm busy.
- Um, we all are?</i>

05:23.876 --> 05:27.175
- Bang. Uh, kill, I guess.
- Thanks a lot.

05:27.346 --> 05:29.576
- It's a bad picture, Pam.
He says it's urgent.

05:29.748 --> 05:31.511
Something about
developments in Krakow?

05:31.683 --> 05:33.810
Krakow? Oh, for...

05:33.986 --> 05:36.819
Sterling, get to Miami,
and don't come back...

05:36.989 --> 05:39.822
until you've completed
your assignment.

05:39.992 --> 05:42.426
- Taking one for the team, huh?
- Hopefully not.

05:42.594 --> 05:45.586
Well if you do, I've developed
a proprietary chemical compound...

05:45.764 --> 05:48.597
which may come in handy.
I call it Formula K.

05:48.767 --> 05:50.667
And it makes you temporarily gay?

05:50.836 --> 05:52.861
I don't know.
Just started human testing.

05:53.038 --> 05:55.336
By dosing Danny the intern's coffee.

05:55.507 --> 05:59.944
- Danny is definitely feeling something.
- I think I'm going to pass.

06:00.112 --> 06:03.445
Suit yourself.
Just means more for me and Danny.

06:03.615 --> 06:06.140
Who is loving it.

06:18.363 --> 06:20.923
I have ascertained the target, sir.

06:21.099 --> 06:23.533
And he's actually quite handsome.

06:23.702 --> 06:25.533
And I suppose that makes it better.

06:25.704 --> 06:28.138
- Doesn't it?
- No, it... Woodhouse, this is Miami.

06:28.307 --> 06:29.968
Don't you have any cooler clothes?

06:30.142 --> 06:33.441
- No sir, not anymore.
- And your shoes.

06:33.612 --> 06:36.638
Because how hard is it to
poach a goddamn egg properly?

06:37.182 --> 06:40.515
Seriously, that's like Eggs 101,
Woodhouse.

06:40.686 --> 06:42.916
Now I know you've lost your mind.

06:43.088 --> 06:44.817
You want me to defect to Russia?

06:44.990 --> 06:48.050
Just, uh, you know, if the worst happens.

06:48.226 --> 06:51.320
<i>That is the worst. Standing in the snow...</i>

06:51.496 --> 06:53.964
<i>for beet rations in my Blahniks?
- Come on.</i>

06:54.132 --> 06:57.158
<i>I'm head of KGB.
I have my beets delivered.</i>

06:57.336 --> 07:01.136
<i>- Nikolai.
- Free Stolichnaya, Beluga caviar.</i>

07:01.306 --> 07:03.274
<i>My own private limousine.</i>

07:03.442 --> 07:06.070
<i>The Soviet system
is actually incredibly unfair.</i>

07:06.244 --> 07:10.374
<i>- And it just sounds wonderful, but...
- Hey, I'm just putting it out there.</i>

07:10.549 --> 07:13.780
<i>Well, just put it back in.
You're the whole reason I'm in this mess.</i>

07:13.952 --> 07:15.817
I'm trying to help.

07:15.988 --> 07:19.185
I mean, if that Cuban
does not fall for the honey pot.

07:19.358 --> 07:20.848
<i>Oh, I think he will.</i>

07:21.026 --> 07:24.689
I've got my top man on it.
Or possibly bottom.

07:33.472 --> 07:37.238
- Ahem. Can I help you?
- I don't know. Can you?

07:37.409 --> 07:40.845
- Is this some sort of viral marketing?
- What? No, I meant...

07:41.013 --> 07:43.573
Or are you asking me,
specifically, if I have a penis?

07:43.749 --> 07:46.479
Uh, it's more of a conversation starter.

07:46.652 --> 07:49.815
<i>And here's a conversation ender. Adios.</i>

07:49.988 --> 07:52.320
- Oh, bilingual snap.
- Thank you.

07:52.491 --> 07:56.427
Do you not see me rocking
this chiseled slab of hard man-body?

07:56.595 --> 07:59.530
- I mean, come on. Are you gay or not?
- I am.

07:59.698 --> 08:02.599
- But you. You are so not my type.
- What?

08:02.768 --> 08:04.497
Hey, I am everybody's type.

08:04.670 --> 08:06.661
- Oh, please.
- What?

08:06.838 --> 08:10.001
- You are entirely too gay.
- No, I'm not.

08:10.175 --> 08:13.235
- Are you kidding?
- Oh my God, you, like, sneeze glitter.

08:13.412 --> 08:14.640
Thank you.

08:17.516 --> 08:19.416
So, yeah. I'm an ISIS agent...

08:19.584 --> 08:21.814
and that Ramón guy's a Cuban agent...

08:21.987 --> 08:25.354
and, uh, I'm supposed to run
what we call a honey pot on him.

08:25.524 --> 08:28.721
I can't believe you have all this
stuff and it's, like, portable.

08:28.894 --> 08:31.362
I can't believe you blab
that you're a secret agent.

08:31.530 --> 08:33.361
I can't believe you're a hairdresser...

08:33.532 --> 08:36.659
and Rudi's an interior decorator.
- God, he's the best in Miami.

08:36.835 --> 08:39.099
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome, sir.

08:39.270 --> 08:41.171
- Lf I had a spoon...
No, no, no.

08:41.339 --> 08:43.169
I would eat you up.
- Don't be nice.

08:43.341 --> 08:47.334
So this spy agency, is it, like, the real
CIA "James Bondy" deal, or what?

08:47.512 --> 08:49.980
Charles, ISIS employs
some of the world's foremost...

08:50.148 --> 08:53.709
intelligence analysts,
covert operatives, and scientists.

08:54.219 --> 08:58.986
- Wait, did Cyril play this stupid game?
- You'll have to play to find out.

08:59.157 --> 09:02.991
Danny. Danny, stop running.
We gotta keep that heart rate down, buddy.

09:03.161 --> 09:06.722
Okay, kill. Bang. Bang.

09:06.898 --> 09:09.833
- Ew, kill.
- Well, thanks a lot.

09:10.001 --> 09:12.799
- Pam, it's a bad picture.
- I think that's hot.

09:12.971 --> 09:15.496
Like, somebody murdering me? It's so...

09:15.674 --> 09:18.939
intimate.
- So, yeah, basically, we're the front line...

09:19.111 --> 09:21.170
in the fight against tyranny.
Thank you.

09:21.346 --> 09:24.042
- My pleasure.
- I wanna dress you up like a little gnome...

09:24.216 --> 09:27.583
and just have you live in my garden.
- I would like some new clothes.

09:27.753 --> 09:30.449
Shut up.
But also and speaking of clothes...

09:30.622 --> 09:33.819
these seem way too normal.
- What, normal as opposed to gay?

09:33.992 --> 09:35.960
Implying that gay is abnormal?

09:36.128 --> 09:38.323
Not abnormal, just gay.

09:38.497 --> 09:41.057
In spite of your personality,
you get plenty of women, right?

09:41.233 --> 09:42.928
Uh, duh and or hello.

09:43.101 --> 09:46.366
So, "duh and or hello,"
just act like you normally do...

09:46.538 --> 09:48.028
around women.
- Really?

09:48.473 --> 09:51.101
Because how hard is it to poach
a goddamn egg properly?

09:53.578 --> 09:56.206
I believe he means before
you lure them into the apartment, sir.

09:56.381 --> 10:00.875
Oh. Yeah, that makes more sense.
So I just like, what? Approach him in a bar?

10:01.052 --> 10:04.044
- Yeah, If I were you, I'd try The Cock Fight.
- What? A cockfight?

10:04.222 --> 10:07.123
- It's the name of a gay bar.
- They also have actual cockfights.

10:07.292 --> 10:09.624
Yeah, Latino men.
You take the bad with the good.

10:09.795 --> 10:13.595
Jesus, what's your problem?
- You are. Blonde, brunette.

10:13.765 --> 10:15.858
I thought I made it clear
you are not my type.

10:16.034 --> 10:18.025
Is that where we landed
on that, because l...

10:18.203 --> 10:20.068
<i>Dios mío. Is your ego so large...</i>

10:20.238 --> 10:22.433
you cannot handle a single rejection?
- Yes.

10:22.607 --> 10:25.838
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I already have a drink.

10:26.011 --> 10:28.605
Why don't you buy him one?
He could use it.

10:28.780 --> 10:32.079
Why... Why don't we all have one
and talk about it.

10:34.119 --> 10:37.885
Seriously Woodhouse, how can you be
so totally awesome and not be gay?

10:38.056 --> 10:42.516
Well, I was very fond
of a boy at school once.

10:42.694 --> 10:44.423
Reggie Thistleton.

10:44.596 --> 10:47.963
- But he died in the war, at Flanders.
- Flanders?

10:48.133 --> 10:50.931
- What war was that?
- Oh, the Great War.

10:51.102 --> 10:53.866
- They're all great.
- Oh, my God, yes, those Nazi uniforms?

10:54.039 --> 10:55.597
- Hugo Boss.
- Shut up.

10:55.774 --> 10:58.834
Swear to God.
And look at slut, just getting home.

10:59.010 --> 11:01.342
- Well, I guess our advice worked.
- No, it didn't.

11:01.513 --> 11:03.913
- Ramón blew me off.
- Then where were you all night?

11:04.082 --> 11:05.913
Way the Christ out in the Everglades...

11:06.084 --> 11:09.076
burying some Dominican guy's rooster.
- Fun.

11:09.788 --> 11:11.119
- Oh, you mean literally.
- Yes.

11:11.289 --> 11:13.189
Sorry.
- I mean, look at my clothes.

11:13.358 --> 11:15.690
And what the hell
are you wearing, Woodhouse?

11:15.861 --> 11:17.192
- L...
- We bought those for him.

11:17.362 --> 11:19.830
If you throw them off the roof
I'll fly to New York...

11:19.998 --> 11:21.795
and fling acid in your face.
- Thank you.

11:23.735 --> 11:26.704
Oh, great.
Mother, I have nothing to report yet.

11:26.872 --> 11:28.430
This is a lot harder than I thought.

11:28.607 --> 11:30.666
<i>How hard could it be to talk a gay man...</i>

11:30.842 --> 11:32.400
<i>... into having anonymous sex?</i>

11:32.577 --> 11:36.035
- See the stereotypes we put up with?
- You don't know what I'm dealing with.

11:36.214 --> 11:38.079
You don't know what I'm dealing with!

11:38.250 --> 11:42.346
<i>See? Here is my nice building,
my limousine, my mother.</i>

11:42.520 --> 11:46.183
<i>Oh, and my apartment is two bedrooms,
so she won't even have to move out.</i>

11:46.358 --> 11:49.156
So you just listen to me, Mr. Man.

11:49.327 --> 11:52.854
Get me some video
of hot man-on-man action by tonight...

11:53.031 --> 11:56.626
<i>...or don't bother coming home.
- She sounds...</i>

11:56.801 --> 11:58.632
fabulous.
- Yeah, she's actually not.

11:58.803 --> 12:00.771
But the stereotype thing
got me thinking...

12:00.939 --> 12:04.705
because, let's see, Ramón is Latino...
- And Latinos are all about machismo.

12:04.876 --> 12:07.674
So you may have to out-macho him.

12:07.846 --> 12:10.644
Out-macho a gay guy? Oh, my stars.

12:10.815 --> 12:14.251
Or, wait, you could just be
a sarcastic bitch your whole life.

12:14.419 --> 12:15.647
<i>- Thank you.
Wait a...</i>

12:15.820 --> 12:17.685
Did you set this whole thing up...

12:17.856 --> 12:20.518
just so I'd have to come
live with you and your mother?

12:20.692 --> 12:25.527
<i>- No! It was merely incompetence.
- And I suppose that makes it better?</i>

12:25.897 --> 12:27.023
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

12:27.198 --> 12:29.928
Wait a minute, how do you know
Ramón's playing jai alai right now?

12:30.101 --> 12:33.229
- Um, he's Latino.
- So it's either that or dominoes.

12:33.405 --> 12:35.498
Stereotypes exist for a reason.

12:35.674 --> 12:38.575
Okay, we're off to get
our scrotums waxed.

12:40.979 --> 12:43.573
Ramón, hey. I have a proposition for you.

12:45.717 --> 12:47.446
Mama, have to call you back.

12:47.619 --> 12:49.712
- Don't you ever give up?
- Not when it comes...

12:49.888 --> 12:51.879
to somebody refusing
to have sex with me.

12:52.057 --> 12:54.048
- You know, consensually or whatever.
- Hmm.

12:54.225 --> 12:57.023
So me and you,
one on one, loser has to do...

12:57.195 --> 12:59.595
whatever the winner says.
- Lf I win...

12:59.764 --> 13:02.733
I want you to leave me alone.
- Fine. But if I win...

13:02.901 --> 13:05.961
we go to your place
and have, you know...

13:06.137 --> 13:08.571
gay sex.
- Have you ever played jai alai?

13:08.740 --> 13:12.176
Uh, actually, lacrosse.
But it's jai alai for white people.

13:12.344 --> 13:14.904
- Lacrosse is gay.
- You're gay. I mean, I am too.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.605
<i>- We're both gay.
- Seriously, I can serve this pelota...</i>

13:17.782 --> 13:21.047
almost two hundred miles an hour.
- Big whoop, that little squishy...

13:21.219 --> 13:24.120
- Jesus, is this made of limestone?
- It's a dangerous game.

13:24.289 --> 13:27.190
Yeah? Well, I'm dangerous.
And I'm gonna win.

13:27.359 --> 13:30.157
- And gay sex.
- Okay.

13:30.328 --> 13:32.228
- Go stand over there.
- Where, over here?

13:32.397 --> 13:35.230
- Mm, little more far.
- What, here?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.231
<i>- Is this...?
- Sí, sí. That's good, right there.</i>

13:37.402 --> 13:39.768
That's what you're gonna
be saying when I'm, uh, all...

13:39.938 --> 13:41.735
inside you with gay sex.

13:43.141 --> 13:44.870
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

13:45.043 --> 13:46.943
- Wait, do I need a helmet?
- Probably.

13:47.112 --> 13:48.909
Wait, what?

13:50.181 --> 13:52.149
I mean, after all...

13:52.317 --> 13:54.751
you are playing
a very dangerous game...

13:54.919 --> 13:58.446
Sterling Archer of ISIS.

14:02.093 --> 14:04.459
<i>There he is. Welcome back, amigo.</i>

14:04.629 --> 14:06.290
Jesus Christ, who...

14:06.464 --> 14:10.901
apparently uses the same
awful decorator as my mother.

14:11.069 --> 14:13.060
Trust me,
whoever decorated this condo...

14:13.238 --> 14:15.297
is not in heaven. And neither are you...

14:15.473 --> 14:18.374
Agent Sterling Archer of ISIS.
- Wait, you know who I am?

14:18.543 --> 14:20.204
<i>Duh and or hola.</i>

14:20.378 --> 14:23.609
- So you know why I'm here.
- I assume because your mother forced you...

14:23.782 --> 14:27.047
to pose as a gay man, in hopes
of catching me in a, how you say...

14:27.218 --> 14:29.880
pot of honey.
- Yeah, which is just so classic her.

14:30.055 --> 14:33.991
- Oh, you should meet my mother. She...
- No, no, no, shut up, listen. My mother...

14:35.827 --> 14:38.523
<i>- Oh, my God, that's her.
- Dios mío. It's her.</i>

14:46.004 --> 14:48.268
L... I can't believe we hung up on them.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.534
- That was so thoroughly awesome, Ramón.
- This is awesome.

14:51.709 --> 14:53.301
- Here, try it.
- No. Whoa, whoa.

14:53.478 --> 14:56.743
- It's raw, man.
- No, the citric acid from the limes...

14:56.915 --> 14:58.849
actually cooks the fish. Try it.

14:59.017 --> 15:00.245
Mm. Mm!

15:00.418 --> 15:03.410
- Oh, my, Ramón, that is amazing.
- Right? Mama always said:

15:07.025 --> 15:10.085
Mine always said: "Sterling,
come in here and check me for lumps."

15:10.261 --> 15:13.196
- Holy shit, was that out loud?
- It's okay. This is a safe place.

15:13.364 --> 15:16.197
- Yeah, but it's not, though.
- Are you referring to these?

15:16.367 --> 15:19.894
- Ha. You found Krieger's cameras?
- I think he is not so good at his job.

15:20.505 --> 15:23.440
Danny!

15:23.608 --> 15:26.270
Dude, that whole agency's
not so good at their jobs.

15:27.745 --> 15:31.977
Kill. Kill. God, when do I get to the end
so I can see what Cyril said?

15:32.150 --> 15:35.210
- You don't think that's hot?
- I seriously think you're scary.

15:35.386 --> 15:38.116
No, no, no, like, a big sweaty fireman...

15:38.289 --> 15:41.349
carries you out of a burning building,
lays you on the sidewalk.

15:41.526 --> 15:43.585
You think,
he's gonna give me mouth-to-mouth.

15:43.761 --> 15:47.197
But instead he just starts
choking the shit out of you...

15:47.365 --> 15:50.198
and the last sensation
that you feel before you die...

15:50.368 --> 15:53.633
is he is squeezing your throat
so hard that a big...

15:53.805 --> 15:58.435
wet blob of drool
drips off his teeth and just: "Blurp!"

15:58.610 --> 16:01.078
Falls right onto your popped-out eyeball.

16:04.048 --> 16:06.676
- Jesus Christ.
- I know, right?

16:06.851 --> 16:09.217
- What the hell?
- I'm wet just thinking about it.

16:09.387 --> 16:11.855
Cyril? Cyril, you get your ass
out here right now.

16:12.023 --> 16:14.651
Is she freaking cause Cyril said
he wanted to bang Danny?

16:14.826 --> 16:16.987
No, it's cause he said
he wanted to marry her.

16:17.162 --> 16:20.131
She's so weird.
Hey, will you choke me a little bit?

16:20.298 --> 16:23.199
<i>Pfft. That's nothing
compared to the pendejos...</i>

16:23.368 --> 16:26.132
I have to work with.
- You haven't banged half of them...

16:26.304 --> 16:30.434
like yours truly.
- I can't. If Fidel found out I'm gay, he'd...

16:30.608 --> 16:33.543
- Well, that's why you're here.
- And maybe it's the concussion...

16:33.711 --> 16:36.544
but I seriously feel crappy about that.
- No.

16:36.714 --> 16:39.945
I feel crappy. I should not have
tried to blackmail your mother.

16:40.118 --> 16:41.608
Yeah, what's on this thing anyway?

16:43.321 --> 16:47.348
Get on the floor, you tacky-ass,
white-after-Labor-Day-wearing bitches.

16:47.525 --> 16:49.425
Thank you.
- Charles and Rudi? What the...?

16:49.594 --> 16:52.154
- What is the meaning of this?
- Sorry. We're a hit squad.

16:52.330 --> 16:55.026
Turns out Fidel is unhappy
that one of his top agents is gay.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.326
<i>Ay, dios mío!</i>

16:56.501 --> 16:58.867
Hey. Save your breath
for cooling your ceviche.

16:59.037 --> 17:00.664
- Ceviche is already cold.
- I know.

17:00.838 --> 17:03.102
You dicks were working
for Castro this whole time?

17:03.274 --> 17:06.071
Positutely, yes.
But we were having such a blast...

17:06.243 --> 17:09.077
hanging with Woodhouse...
- Who's fine by the way.

17:09.247 --> 17:12.239
- I'm genuinely sorry about this.
- But may I can keep the clothes?

17:12.416 --> 17:13.849
Forever and always.

17:14.352 --> 17:17.219
- Not that you care.
- Yeah, I actually don't.

17:17.387 --> 17:20.618
- So are you two even really gay?
- As big old tangerines, yes.

17:20.791 --> 17:24.454
Then how can you work for Castro?
You know his stance on homosexuality.

17:24.628 --> 17:27.393
Because, commie,
I have something called a mortgage.

17:27.565 --> 17:30.864
Hey, whoa, if this is about money,
I know somebody who'd pay...

17:31.035 --> 17:33.162
a whole lot of money to get this back.

17:33.338 --> 17:34.965
- Sterling, no.
- Hey, Ramón, shut up.

17:35.139 --> 17:37.903
- Let the mummy talk.
- I can't let you do this.

17:38.076 --> 17:40.840
<i>What the...?
- You'll never take me alive, bastardos.</i>

17:41.679 --> 17:43.670
Let's outsource it
to some cracked-up Haitians...

17:43.848 --> 17:45.509
that's what I said. You know why?

17:45.683 --> 17:48.277
So you could be all
Little Miss "Hindsight's 20-20."

17:48.453 --> 17:50.614
- Here, take this.
- Why did you have a salad gun?

17:50.788 --> 17:54.246
- Ah, I was going to kill you.
- Oh, you are just the worst kind of...

17:54.425 --> 17:56.086
Me? Your mother started all of this.

17:56.261 --> 17:58.593
So give them the freaking disk.
If I do that...

17:58.763 --> 18:01.630
it will become public.
And if you see what's on this disk...

18:01.799 --> 18:04.427
- Well if you weren't gay, you will be.
- Ha, ha! Well, what is it?

18:04.602 --> 18:07.093
A sex tape of Mother?

18:07.272 --> 18:08.864
- Ahem.
- Oh, my...

18:10.708 --> 18:12.198
But there, you see. It's gone.

18:13.645 --> 18:15.272
So it's okay, just let it all...

18:15.446 --> 18:18.142
Jesus, God, do you ladies
want to put on your nightgowns...

18:18.316 --> 18:20.580
crack open a tube of cookie dough
and talk?

18:20.752 --> 18:23.880
Goddamn it, we're dealing
with some profound issues here...

18:24.055 --> 18:26.387
you queer.
- What the hell, man?

18:26.557 --> 18:28.787
Sorry, I meant homosexual person.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.860
<i>No, you idiota. We have
a finite number of bullets.</i>

18:32.263 --> 18:33.924
- Oh, my bad.
- Oh, my bad.

18:34.098 --> 18:38.467
- Ha, ha. Now who feels stupid?
- My guess is both of you.

18:38.636 --> 18:41.400
Since the last thing you see
is gonna be that horrific sofa.

18:41.572 --> 18:44.405
Shut up, I bet you're not even
a real interior decorator.

18:44.575 --> 18:47.806
Well, he's not licensed or anything,
but he's got a real flair for it.

18:47.979 --> 18:49.776
- Thank you.
- So how about stand up...

18:49.947 --> 18:52.074
and let us paint the walls
with your brains.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.218
- Here, take this.
Jesus, Ramón, a Claymore?

18:54.385 --> 18:56.478
- I can explain.
- You were gonna frag me?

18:56.654 --> 19:00.385
No. This was for decorating.
What, look at this place.

19:00.558 --> 19:03.823
- I was going to have to start from scratch.
- The kitchen's not bad.

19:03.995 --> 19:07.192
Oh, God, are you kidding?
That kitchen is awful... Oh, crap.

19:07.365 --> 19:09.492
No, thank you.

19:13.471 --> 19:16.463
Ramón, was that not totally epic?

19:16.641 --> 19:19.405
<i>Sí, Sterling.
Because you lived to tell the tale.</i>

19:19.577 --> 19:22.774
No, no, no,
because my mother's condo got trashed.

19:22.947 --> 19:25.973
God, she is gonna freak when...
Wait, where's Charles and Rudi?

19:26.150 --> 19:30.484
Hmm. I think they must have escaped,
however implausible that may seem.

19:30.655 --> 19:32.782
That does seem implausible.

19:32.957 --> 19:35.425
And so, I must now go into hiding.

19:35.593 --> 19:37.322
Fidel will keep sending hit squads...

19:37.495 --> 19:41.761
and he will not stop until I am dead.
- So, what, just a life on the run?

19:41.933 --> 19:44.493
<i>Sí, just like el Doctor David Banner.</i>

19:44.669 --> 19:47.069
<i>- How do you say "The Hulk" in Spanish?
- El Hulk.</i>

19:47.238 --> 19:48.466
- Gay.
- What?

19:48.639 --> 19:51.870
- We don't have a word for "Hulk."
- Do you have a word for "gay?"

19:52.043 --> 19:53.101
- Gay.
- Gayer!

19:53.277 --> 19:55.245
Jesus, Spanish, our jobs aren't enough.

19:55.413 --> 19:57.313
- Now you got to take our words?
- Sterling.

19:57.482 --> 19:59.143
I didn't mean that, it was racist.

19:59.317 --> 20:01.785
And even though you were
gonna shoot and or frag me...

20:01.953 --> 20:03.921
I feel like we had
kind of a connection.

20:04.088 --> 20:07.524
I'm sad because we had
a connection, and now...

20:07.692 --> 20:09.819
And now I feel like a dick so come on.

20:09.994 --> 20:12.588
- Let me turn that frown upside down.
- How?

20:12.764 --> 20:15.198
Well, the bedroom
was untouched by the explosion.

20:15.366 --> 20:17.891
- I'm listening.
- So let's blow the shit out of it.

20:18.069 --> 20:19.866
Oh. I thought you meant
you wanted to...

20:22.173 --> 20:24.698
- Ramón.
- And just why is that so funny?

20:24.876 --> 20:28.107
Not that. Woodhouse.
He's all tied up somewhere.

20:28.279 --> 20:30.611
Scared... Scared and alone.

20:32.650 --> 20:34.709
Probably dehydrated.
