00:04.715 --> 00:07.003
You're showing Ariel my picture
every day right?

00:07.175 --> 00:10.379
Chocolate cake and spaghetti, Ma?
Might've died and gone to heaven.

00:10.554 --> 00:13.009
You said if I make it back alive,
you'd flash your high beams.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.676
Yeah. Well, I'm back.

00:14.850 --> 00:18.016
Yeah, I brought you a case
of A'tomic Pom Rip It.

00:18.186 --> 00:21.271
- Thought you missed it more than me.
- Come on, Rick. You know I missed you.

00:21.440 --> 00:25.022
Missed you too. And you know
what else I missed? A real apple.

00:25.193 --> 00:28.527
Not these Styrofoam pieces of crap
the Army tries to pass off as real.

00:29.031 --> 00:30.883
There's already a dozen of them
in your kitchen.

00:30.907 --> 00:33.030
Drew, now...
You have got to see this.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.360
Okay. Yeah. Hold on for a second.

00:35.537 --> 00:38.657
If you could have those windows
fixed this week, that'd be great.

00:39.291 --> 00:40.619
I love you too.

00:42.794 --> 00:44.621
- What've you got?
- Feast your eyes...

00:44.796 --> 00:48.461
on what one of the nurses found.
It's Ragosa. He has a dating profile.

00:48.633 --> 00:51.207
Santana2001.

00:52.763 --> 00:55.882
- "Likes long walks on the beach."
- Well, who doesn't?

00:56.058 --> 00:57.801
"Everything life has to offer."

01:00.645 --> 01:01.926
Is that Ragosa?

01:02.522 --> 01:04.930
Oh, my God.
His ex-wife's hand's in the picture.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.900
Respond like a woman
who's interested.

01:07.069 --> 01:10.105
That's crossing the line.
Leave him alone on this. All right?

01:10.280 --> 01:11.359
He's just lonely.

01:11.531 --> 01:14.105
Doesn't have your moves, man.
He doesn't have them.

01:14.284 --> 01:16.490
- Can I grab you for a sec?
- Yes.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.974
I gotta get out of here on time
after this shift.

01:19.998 --> 01:24.043
So if you finish my charts for me,
I will cover a weekend shift for you.

01:24.211 --> 01:26.499
Yeah? Rick's back in town tonight,
isn't he?

01:26.672 --> 01:28.463
Yes.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.056
I've been walking around
all night long...

01:41.228 --> 01:44.182
trying to get you
out of my mind, but...

01:44.856 --> 01:47.229
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:47.401 --> 01:49.192
<i>About our kiss.</i>

01:50.529 --> 01:51.643
What do I do with that?

01:51.822 --> 01:55.155
I guess I just thought
I should just tell you the truth.

01:56.243 --> 01:57.523
<i>You wanna wait for Jordan?</i>

01:57.703 --> 02:00.953
She's running late.
Told me to start without her.

02:01.123 --> 02:03.281
All right. Gather around, everyone.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.703
Gather around, please.

02:05.627 --> 02:08.544
I wanna thank you for
coming in a little bit early tonight.

02:08.714 --> 02:10.457
I have four cranky women
in my house.

02:10.632 --> 02:13.882
- I will come in whenever you want.
- I have five sisters. I get it.

02:14.052 --> 02:17.255
Anyway, I wanna talk to you
guys about some ways...

02:17.431 --> 02:19.756
that I think we can have better
cooperation...

02:19.933 --> 02:22.222
between the ER and
the Surgical departments.

02:22.394 --> 02:23.853
You and Jordan running things...

02:24.021 --> 02:27.935
- I'd like to think it's better already.
- True. We've been talking a lot about it.

02:28.108 --> 02:30.813
- I believe we...
- Excuse me, doctor. That was dispatch.

02:30.986 --> 02:33.524
Bus accident, highway 190.
Passengers are soldiers.

02:33.697 --> 02:35.524
Multiple victims, total count unknown.

02:35.699 --> 02:38.819
Going to every hospital.
Ours will be here in 20 minutes.

02:38.994 --> 02:41.283
- All right, Scott.
- Let's clean and prep Trauma.

02:41.455 --> 02:44.456
- Call all available surgeons.
- I'm calling Jordan to get here.

02:44.624 --> 02:46.783
Mollie, call TC please.

02:59.598 --> 03:02.385
BP 98 over 53. Pulse 131.

03:02.559 --> 03:05.050
Blunt-force trauma to chest.
Multiple fractured ribs.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.604
Collapsed lung?

03:08.565 --> 03:10.771
No. Heart sounds muffled.
Look at his neck veins.

03:10.942 --> 03:14.193
Cardiac tamponade. Get me an
18-gauge needle on a 60 cc syringe.

03:14.363 --> 03:16.439
Drain the blood
from around his heart.

03:22.746 --> 03:27.289
Okay. Take over.
Continue pulling slowly.

03:27.459 --> 03:28.953
- All right.
- Okay.

03:29.127 --> 03:30.586
Thanks.

03:33.131 --> 03:35.705
Let's go.
We need more staff. Let's go.

03:39.054 --> 03:40.797
Oh, man. Intestines.

03:40.972 --> 03:44.223
- A little help here.
- What have we got?

03:44.393 --> 03:47.975
It looks a lot worse than it is.
Quick fix in the OR. Get him inside.

03:53.819 --> 03:56.392
Jordan, we need your help over here.

03:58.907 --> 04:00.947
Okay. Pelvis is unstable.

04:01.118 --> 04:03.490
We need an abdomen-pelvic CT
with contrast.

04:03.662 --> 04:05.987
Type and cross for six.
All right. Let's go.

04:06.957 --> 04:08.665
We gotta get this area clear.

04:09.209 --> 04:12.210
Facial trauma. Get him straight
to the OR. I'm coming with you.

04:12.587 --> 04:13.916
Scott, where are you going?

04:14.089 --> 04:17.291
- OR to trach. Airway's filled with blood.
- Take the crike kit.

04:17.718 --> 04:19.341
Drew, I need extra hands here.

04:19.511 --> 04:23.378
Drew. Drew. Where you going?
I need you.

04:23.932 --> 04:25.972
T. T, I need you now.

04:26.143 --> 04:28.978
- Please, over here.
- Toph. Toph. Hey, Toph. Toph.

04:30.689 --> 04:33.180
- What's up?
- Hey, this is Rick.

04:33.358 --> 04:35.185
- As in "Rick"?
- Yeah.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.838
- He lost a lot of blood.
- I'm on it.

04:36.862 --> 04:39.649
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

04:39.823 --> 04:41.151
- Move, move.
- Everybody out.

04:41.324 --> 04:44.029
- Move, move.
- Dr. Alexander and Dr. Cummings...

04:44.202 --> 04:45.531
burn victim, Trauma 1.

04:45.704 --> 04:48.658
Blunt orbital trauma in Trauma 2.
Let's go.

04:48.832 --> 04:51.537
Get the cardiac tamponade upstairs.
I'm right behind you.

04:51.710 --> 04:54.995
Topher. You take over TC's
crushed leg. Stabilise him.

04:55.172 --> 04:57.959
- He's mine and Drew's with me.
- You really questioning me?

04:58.133 --> 04:59.212
Drew's Army Reserve.

04:59.384 --> 05:01.756
Need to teach him things
he'll need in the field.

05:01.928 --> 05:04.633
- It's all right. Let him have the patient.
- Fine.

05:04.806 --> 05:07.724
Bring him up to Pre-Op in an hour,
I need to amputate.

05:11.104 --> 05:13.097
Type and cross
for six units of PRBC's...

05:13.273 --> 05:15.764
and give me four units FFP.

05:15.942 --> 05:18.860
No palpable distal pulses.
Ruptured his popliteal artery.

05:19.029 --> 05:21.602
Need to stop the bleeding.
Hand me a large hemostat.

05:21.782 --> 05:24.023
Can't let him amputate.
You gotta save his leg.

05:24.368 --> 05:27.368
Kenny, page the vascular surgeon
on-call. Get him here now.

05:27.537 --> 05:29.418
Dr. Murphy's with another
soldier at University.

05:29.539 --> 05:31.912
No. We need him now.
He's gotta come now.

05:32.084 --> 05:33.494
Gotta get him. Figure it out.

05:33.669 --> 05:35.328
Drew, Drew. Hey.
I'm working here.

05:35.504 --> 05:37.959
This isn't gonna help Rick.
Keep it together.

05:38.131 --> 05:40.503
We stop the bleeding,
go outside, take a breath.

05:40.676 --> 05:43.593
I'll call you if anything changes.
I promise.

05:43.762 --> 05:45.885
- You get them...
- Just go.

06:10.664 --> 06:13.202
Once you irrigate the wound,
cut away dead tissue.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.490
All right.

06:15.419 --> 06:17.292
- You gonna use scissors?
- Put that down.

06:17.462 --> 06:20.132
She's not using scissors.
She's gonna use a scalpel.

06:20.674 --> 06:22.548
It gives us cleaner edges.

06:22.718 --> 06:26.003
I promise, Private Wilson,
I will be gentle with you.

06:26.179 --> 06:27.839
Okay.

06:30.308 --> 06:32.301
So, are you from around here?

06:32.477 --> 06:34.636
That a pick-up line
or you really wanna know?

06:35.188 --> 06:37.679
- I don't know, I...
- Cat's got your tongue.

06:37.858 --> 06:39.482
It's probably the concussion.

06:39.651 --> 06:41.478
Snap, Wilson.

06:41.653 --> 06:45.069
Well, only if I got it from you,
because you're a knockout.

06:46.700 --> 06:50.947
See how I turned that around there?
The concussion, knockout.

06:52.289 --> 06:53.783
It was excellent work, PFC.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.118
I'm gonna go grab some dressings.

06:59.755 --> 07:02.672
Hey, do you think I have a shot
with her, doc?

07:02.841 --> 07:04.750
If you don't give it a try...

07:05.093 --> 07:07.169
it might just pass you by.

07:09.014 --> 07:11.006
We got a call in to
the ophthalmologist.

07:11.183 --> 07:14.100
Until then, avoid sneezing,
straining, blowing your nose.

07:14.269 --> 07:17.555
Look. No offence, but I don't take
advice from children, Doogie.

07:17.731 --> 07:20.767
All right. Listen.
Doogie Howser was 16. I'm 24.

07:20.942 --> 07:23.433
Also, he was a television doctor.
I am a real doctor.

07:23.612 --> 07:26.103
Yeah. Point taken
and ignored, Doogie.

07:26.281 --> 07:29.068
- You can call me Dr. Cummings.
- What was that, Dr. Howser?

07:29.242 --> 07:31.947
- I mean, Doogie.
- Dr. De la Cruz?

07:32.120 --> 07:34.077
Dr. De la Cruz?

07:34.998 --> 07:37.157
Don't kill the messenger.
Mrs. Palmer's back.

07:37.334 --> 07:38.828
Oh, no.

07:39.002 --> 07:42.205
Does anyone need me?
PTSD? Depression?

07:42.381 --> 07:44.108
- Anything you wanna talk about?
- I'm all right.

07:44.132 --> 07:46.588
I got a meth-induced psychosis
handcuffed to his bed.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.753
I'll take it. Seen her
three times this month.

07:48.929 --> 07:50.340
- I know.
- Won't take her meds.

07:50.514 --> 07:54.891
Won't follow up with outpatient psych,
and the extra paperwork is...

07:55.060 --> 07:56.638
Dr. De la Cruz.

07:56.812 --> 08:00.596
- Have I got a doozy of a story for you.
- Almost ready, Miss Palmer.

08:13.453 --> 08:15.695
Sorry, man.
We know it's crazy with the troops.

08:15.872 --> 08:18.743
Thought we'd entertain
while Julio waited to be seen.

08:18.917 --> 08:21.538
Julio's got a stomach ache.
Must've been the bad sushi.

08:21.712 --> 08:24.748
I am sorry to everyone
for the long wait.

08:24.923 --> 08:28.458
But this is not a concert hall.
This is a waiting room.

08:28.635 --> 08:29.714
Dr. Cummings.

08:29.886 --> 08:32.174
Please look at Mr. Julio.
He's not looking good.

08:32.347 --> 08:36.131
In the meantime, I'm sure everyone
would appreciate a little quiet.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.017
I don't appreciate quiet.

08:38.186 --> 08:40.724
Music is a wonderful gift,
and they should share it.

08:40.897 --> 08:43.304
You play so beautifully.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.143
Play "Free Bird."

08:45.318 --> 08:48.236
Mr. Ragosa, Julio is displaying
Kussmaul respirations.

08:48.405 --> 08:50.279
I believe he's in
diabetic ketoacidosis.

08:50.449 --> 08:53.485
- He needs to get on an insulin drip.
- Take him in.

08:55.954 --> 08:57.579
Okay.

09:01.376 --> 09:04.046
- You've done this before, right?
- Drew, chill...

09:04.212 --> 09:07.166
or I'll send you out again. Scissors.

09:07.758 --> 09:11.755
I'm using a heavy silk tie to secure
the proximal anastomosis.

09:11.928 --> 09:14.170
And now place the vessel clamps...

09:14.348 --> 09:17.432
and if we're lucky,
everything starts flowing.

09:17.601 --> 09:19.510
- How long?
- We'll know right away.

09:19.686 --> 09:21.513
Just keeping blood flow to the foot...

09:21.688 --> 09:24.096
until Murphy gets here to asses
if there's enough to save.

09:24.274 --> 09:26.895
We'll need a couple of hours
to see if it's gonna take.

09:27.486 --> 09:31.733
- Okay.
- I feel a pulse. It's weak, but it's there.

09:33.408 --> 09:34.606
Thanks.

09:34.785 --> 09:36.445
Drew, this is just a Hail Mary...

09:36.620 --> 09:38.659
so don't get your hopes up
too high.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.206
Okay?

09:41.708 --> 09:43.617
Right. Yeah.

09:50.467 --> 09:52.923
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:53.095 --> 09:55.799
Lots of surgeries
lining up from the ER.

09:55.972 --> 09:57.348
You okay?

09:57.516 --> 10:00.089
Another day,
another dozen surgeries.

10:00.268 --> 10:02.938
Hey, I couldn't help but notice
in all the craziness...

10:03.105 --> 10:04.350
you pulling up with TC.

10:04.523 --> 10:06.895
Dr. Clemmens, they're ready
for you in Surgical 2.

10:07.067 --> 10:09.143
The leg amputation's
scheduled after that.

10:09.319 --> 10:12.486
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I...

10:12.948 --> 10:14.857
I brought TC to work today...

10:15.033 --> 10:18.698
because his bike is in the shop,
and he needed a ride.

10:18.870 --> 10:20.993
Why didn't he call Topher
or Landry...

10:21.164 --> 10:24.331
or any of the other million people
around here who idolize him?

10:24.501 --> 10:28.036
- Does he call you like this all the time?
- No. It's a one-time thing.

10:29.006 --> 10:32.256
Well, one time too many.
All right. I gotta jump.

10:38.932 --> 10:40.307
Yeah, all right.

10:40.475 --> 10:43.393
Okay. So I...
I have him in my sights...

10:43.562 --> 10:46.563
Hey, Doogie. I see you, baby.

10:46.732 --> 10:49.305
Doogie. Doogie. Doogie.

10:49.484 --> 10:53.814
Doogie. Doogie. Doogie.

10:56.283 --> 10:58.322
You have to earn their respect, man.

11:02.539 --> 11:04.282
Doogie...

11:06.543 --> 11:10.042
- You need something?
- Okay. I saw your dating profile.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.165
- How did you...?
- Don't be embarrassed.

11:14.343 --> 11:17.213
Look, you're not the only one
around here who's on the site.

11:17.387 --> 11:19.878
How are we supposed to meet
anybody with these hours?

11:20.057 --> 11:21.467
Is there a point to this?

11:21.641 --> 11:23.433
Give me the next two Saturdays off...

11:23.602 --> 11:26.638
and I'll help you fix your really
horrible, pathetic...

11:26.813 --> 11:29.898
just terrible dating profile.
No offence.

11:30.484 --> 11:34.351
Look. It's not you. It's your profile.
You're a great looking guy with a job.

11:34.529 --> 11:37.614
And if you say you like kids? What?

11:37.783 --> 11:40.570
That makes you like Johnny Depp
to single moms out there.

11:40.744 --> 11:42.487
So, you help me...

11:42.662 --> 11:44.620
and I'll help you.

11:44.790 --> 11:46.367
You know what I'm saying?

11:47.709 --> 11:49.287
Okay.

11:49.461 --> 11:52.497
The OR's swamped. Your case
has been pushed to the morning.

11:52.673 --> 11:56.006
- So, you're stuck down here.
- Oh, I like it here.

11:56.176 --> 11:58.169
- Is it the fluorescent lighting?
- No.

11:58.345 --> 12:01.215
The screaming? Antiseptic smell?

12:01.390 --> 12:03.963
No, it's you. Definitely.

12:04.351 --> 12:07.554
- Wilson going in for the kill.
- Stop.

12:07.729 --> 12:10.979
- No, you're sweet, private.
- Do it, Wilson. Do it.

12:11.149 --> 12:13.023
- Ask her.
- Come on man. Do it.

12:13.193 --> 12:15.862
- Do what?
- Okay, all right.

12:16.613 --> 12:18.273
Since you think I'm sweet...

12:19.282 --> 12:22.367
I haven't been out with a girl
since high-school prom...

12:22.536 --> 12:25.205
- And wasn't that your cousin?
- No. It was your sister.

12:25.372 --> 12:27.661
And she said that I kiss
better than you.

12:29.418 --> 12:31.375
Wilson scores.

12:32.295 --> 12:33.955
As I was saying...

12:34.131 --> 12:38.259
would you do me the honour
of going on a date with me?

12:39.011 --> 12:41.715
- An honour? Really?
- Yeah. No. You're a doctor.

12:41.888 --> 12:46.764
You're smart and beautiful
and way out of my league.

12:46.935 --> 12:48.014
It's a huge honour.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.011
Well, it would be my honour
to go out with you, PFC...

12:51.189 --> 12:54.808
but as your doctor,
really, I'm not allowed to.

12:54.985 --> 12:56.444
Told you. Never gonna happen.

12:56.611 --> 12:59.067
Hey, no, at least Wilson had
the guts to ask me...

12:59.239 --> 13:03.284
and you were all sitting there, staring
at my ass like scared little schoolgirls.

13:03.452 --> 13:05.528
Oh, yeah, Dr. Krista. Up top.

13:07.205 --> 13:09.494
- Hey.
- Dude. Your eye's bleeding.

13:10.876 --> 13:12.667
- Oh, my God.
- Don't touch your eyes.

13:13.003 --> 13:16.170
Get Topher in here now.
Easy, easy, easy.

13:24.681 --> 13:26.425
So, what's the deal, doc?

13:26.600 --> 13:29.969
Have you been feeling tired,
or run down in the last few weeks?

13:30.812 --> 13:33.101
Yeah. I guess.
I mean not more than usual.

13:33.273 --> 13:34.933
Right. Will you hand me the chart?

13:35.108 --> 13:38.940
And notice the petechial rash
on his extremities.

13:39.112 --> 13:41.899
Low platelets.
That explains the bleeding.

13:42.074 --> 13:44.481
Family history of bruising
or bleeding disorders?

13:44.659 --> 13:47.115
No, Dr. Krista.

13:48.246 --> 13:50.322
We have to get you
some blood tests.

13:50.499 --> 13:54.081
Get you going with some platelets.
A nurse will be in soon.

14:00.926 --> 14:02.965
- Okay.
- What's wrong with me?

14:03.136 --> 14:06.552
I will make sure we find out. Okay?
Just don't be scared.

14:06.723 --> 14:09.261
I'm not. I'm not scared,
I kicked the Taliban's ass.

14:09.434 --> 14:11.557
- Okay. I'll bet you did.
- Yeah.

14:12.771 --> 14:16.436
- Is Captain Rick gonna be okay?
- We're gonna have to wait and see.

14:16.608 --> 14:19.692
- What about his leg?
- What about my leg?

14:19.861 --> 14:22.103
Hey, captain. How you feeling?

14:22.280 --> 14:23.691
Drew?

14:23.865 --> 14:25.823
Hey, what are you doing here?

14:26.326 --> 14:27.405
I work here.

14:27.577 --> 14:29.570
Me and Rick went
through Basic together.

14:29.746 --> 14:32.154
I'm an ER doctor
at San Antonio Memorial.

14:32.332 --> 14:35.452
Anyway, you were in a bus accident
on Highway 190.

14:35.627 --> 14:37.703
I was gonna make you an omelette
after work.

14:37.879 --> 14:39.872
- What? You... Okay.
- Yeah. You know?

14:40.507 --> 14:42.915
Hey, we need to clear out,
give some space...

14:43.093 --> 14:44.753
so we can examine him properly.

14:44.928 --> 14:49.222
- I may have given him too many meds.
- Yeah. Just not quite himself so...

14:50.308 --> 14:51.968
You guys can visit him later.

14:52.561 --> 14:54.103
Thanks.

14:55.772 --> 14:58.180
- I'm at a hospital.
- Yeah.

14:59.401 --> 15:00.432
Was I hurt?

15:02.738 --> 15:05.655
Oh, my God. My leg...

15:05.824 --> 15:07.402
- You gotta listen to me.
- My leg.

15:07.576 --> 15:10.992
- What's wrong with my leg?
- Don't touch it. Don't dislodge the tubes.

15:11.163 --> 15:14.164
Rick, listen to me. Look at me.
Look at me. You gotta rest.

15:14.499 --> 15:16.825
Okay? You gotta sit back,
and you gotta trust me.

15:17.002 --> 15:18.247
Okay.

15:20.422 --> 15:24.420
I got our best guy on this,
and he is gonna take care of you.

15:24.593 --> 15:26.135
But now you need your rest...

15:26.303 --> 15:29.138
and I promise that
I'm watching out for you.

15:31.850 --> 15:33.475
You always do.

15:35.854 --> 15:37.099
I'm so glad to see you.

15:41.234 --> 15:43.357
When did you get those Grey hairs?

15:45.864 --> 15:47.524
I painted them on just for you.

15:49.368 --> 15:52.322
Yeah. Those scrubs
don't do you justice.

15:52.496 --> 15:53.906
What?

15:54.081 --> 15:56.239
I painted them on just for you.

15:59.544 --> 16:01.204
I'm glad you're back.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.677
Hey, hey, hey.

16:14.851 --> 16:18.267
Hey, I only have a minute,
but you know you can talk to me. Right?

16:18.730 --> 16:23.273
- I can't believe this is happening.
- I know. It's... It's terrible.

16:24.444 --> 16:26.152
Is there anything I can do?

16:26.321 --> 16:27.899
Nothing.

16:29.533 --> 16:32.237
Not a thing.
That's the frustrating part.

16:34.162 --> 16:38.077
I can't do anything. I can't help him...

16:38.250 --> 16:41.251
and I can't talk to him
the way I wanna talk to him.

16:41.503 --> 16:43.045
This place is a zoo.

16:44.214 --> 16:46.088
Do you really think
anyone would care?

16:46.258 --> 16:49.342
I'm not being the gay doctor.

16:50.012 --> 16:51.174
I will not play that.

16:51.346 --> 16:52.971
I will not. That's...

16:54.057 --> 16:57.011
My patients might not be as thrilled
as all you guys. Okay?

16:57.185 --> 16:59.723
And then Rick,
and he's got his guys here, so I...

16:59.938 --> 17:01.682
Oh, man. I gotta go.

17:01.857 --> 17:05.060
No, yeah. Yeah, me too,
but Drew, Drew.

17:05.234 --> 17:08.569
Just try and breathe. Okay?

17:15.328 --> 17:18.032
I have some
really, really good news.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.531
I know that you were worried
because I thought...

17:20.709 --> 17:24.243
I was being stalked by Matt Damon,
but I was not telling you the truth.

17:24.838 --> 17:26.996
- That's progress.
- Matt and I are in love.

17:27.174 --> 17:30.839
And now,
we have a bun in the oven.

17:31.011 --> 17:33.632
- You think you're pregnant?
- Oh, I know I'm pregnant.

17:33.805 --> 17:39.641
I've been carrying this baby
for two years now, and it is coming.

17:39.811 --> 17:41.970
Well, then, why don't we
do a pregnancy test?

17:42.147 --> 17:44.021
- Just to be sure.
- You know what?

17:44.191 --> 17:47.607
A test would offer proof to that
sister of mine. She thinks I'm cuckoo.

17:47.778 --> 17:50.103
No one in my family
believes that I am pregnant.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.771
Then let's show them the truth.
Come on.

17:52.949 --> 17:57.196
- So, you love to cook.
- No, I don't love to cook.

17:57.371 --> 17:59.696
Online dating is like a job interview.

17:59.873 --> 18:01.533
You say whatever they need to hear.

18:02.084 --> 18:03.494
Okay?

18:03.669 --> 18:06.290
- So, what can you cook?
- Eggs.

18:06.463 --> 18:10.710
Omelettes. That's perfect. That says,
"Come over, spend the night."

18:10.884 --> 18:14.218
We'll do a little bit of this
in the morning. It's beautiful.

18:14.388 --> 18:17.258
That's weird. This is all so weird.

18:18.100 --> 18:21.634
I haven't dated anybody in 15 years.

18:21.812 --> 18:23.721
God, I met my wife in high school.

18:23.897 --> 18:27.147
Unless you wanna get arrested,
meet the next woman someplace else.

18:27.317 --> 18:30.022
Now, next question.
"What do you look for?"

18:30.195 --> 18:32.686
- What type do you like?
- I like petite.

18:32.864 --> 18:35.984
Someone who speaks her mind,
smart, professional.

18:36.159 --> 18:38.069
Yeah. Good luck finding that online.

18:38.620 --> 18:40.696
All right. Let's post this thing.

18:40.872 --> 18:43.198
I'm Dr. De la Cruz
from San Antonio Memorial...

18:43.375 --> 18:46.080
calling about your sister,
Jessica Palmer?

18:46.336 --> 18:47.830
Hello?

18:48.213 --> 18:49.588
Hello?

18:52.551 --> 18:53.665
Tough shift?

18:53.844 --> 18:56.132
Mrs. Palmer's back
and driving me crazy.

18:57.556 --> 18:59.798
How's the guy with the leg injury?

18:59.975 --> 19:02.014
Not good.

19:02.185 --> 19:05.389
Trying to save it, but you're probably
gonna need to talk to him.

19:06.732 --> 19:08.771
- To help him through the process.
- Yeah.

19:08.942 --> 19:13.070
Hey, T. Just a little help?

19:13.280 --> 19:15.687
Make time for Captain Lincoln, please.

19:15.866 --> 19:17.693
What's up, Dr. Alexander?

19:17.868 --> 19:20.869
I need your guys' opinion
on the kid with the nosebleed.

19:21.038 --> 19:23.529
Okay, I mean... All right.

19:23.707 --> 19:26.910
Sorry, sir. Okay. Look at this.
He has almost no platelets.

19:27.085 --> 19:30.419
- What could cause them to plummet?
- Leukaemia.

19:30.589 --> 19:33.792
Yeah, but his other blood-cell
lines are not affected.

19:33.967 --> 19:35.296
- Right.
- Maybe Dengue Fever?

19:35.469 --> 19:39.716
Where would he have caught it? He was
in Afghanistan, not Vietnam. DIC?

19:39.890 --> 19:41.717
His coags and fibrinogen are normal.

19:41.892 --> 19:43.849
Maybe an autoimmune disorder?

19:44.019 --> 19:45.679
Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic
Purpura.

19:46.271 --> 19:47.434
ITP.

19:47.606 --> 19:51.105
Low platelets, normal crit
and white cells.

19:51.276 --> 19:52.651
ITP.

19:52.819 --> 19:57.113
- You, case closed. Thank you.
- Anytime.

19:57.282 --> 19:59.856
- So, you got Drew's friend, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:00.035 --> 20:03.071
A Fort Hood buddy.
But you know, he's stable now.

20:03.246 --> 20:05.488
Good. I thought he was getting
amputated.

20:05.665 --> 20:09.366
- No. Wanna try every avenue first.
- Of course. Right.

20:09.544 --> 20:10.789
You did great.

20:10.962 --> 20:13.536
- Hey, I need to talk to you for a second.
- Sure.

20:13.799 --> 20:18.342
So Scott saw us arrive today.

20:18.512 --> 20:23.553
And I told him that you needed a ride
because your bike was in the shop.

20:24.601 --> 20:26.677
- Why would you tell him that?
- I don't know.

20:26.853 --> 20:28.498
I just didn't wanna upset him
that you came by.

20:28.522 --> 20:31.095
- And I feel terrible.
- About the other day?

20:31.274 --> 20:32.437
No.

20:32.609 --> 20:34.981
No, because I lied.

20:35.153 --> 20:37.905
Okay. I don't know
how I feel about that kiss.

20:38.073 --> 20:40.943
You know what?
That's not even true. Okay?

20:41.118 --> 20:44.569
- I feel guilty. I'm confused. I...
- Jordan, they need you in Trauma 1.

20:44.746 --> 20:48.495
TC, Dr. Clemmens wants to see you
in the OR immediately.

20:53.088 --> 20:56.788
I've been waiting to do the amputation
on Captain Lincoln...

20:56.967 --> 21:00.418
and I just found out that you did
an external emergency bypass.

21:00.595 --> 21:02.635
I tried to give him
a chance to save his leg.

21:02.806 --> 21:03.837
He has no chance.

21:04.016 --> 21:06.720
- I haven't asked for a consult.
- Excuse me, Dr. Callahan.

21:06.893 --> 21:10.677
- I'm not ready to amputate.
- Your job is to stabilise.

21:10.856 --> 21:12.564
They need surgery, they come to me.

21:12.733 --> 21:14.974
And you amputate the limbs
of old people...

21:15.152 --> 21:16.776
and people who have been sick.

21:16.945 --> 21:19.401
Soldiers need to feel like
this is the last resort.

21:19.573 --> 21:22.823
That's Landry's job, not yours.
You wasted my time.

21:22.993 --> 21:24.953
Next time, I'll consider
your delicate feelings...

21:25.078 --> 21:29.123
- before the person losing his leg.
- Make this about me. Do you not get it?

21:29.291 --> 21:33.371
I was waiting in the OR.
Four soldiers in line to get opened up.

21:33.545 --> 21:35.917
Because you thought
it was okay to do your own thing.

21:36.089 --> 21:38.580
Not my thing. Okay?
My patient's thing.

21:38.759 --> 21:43.421
- So, you leave it for a few more hours.
- This whole kamikaze...

21:43.597 --> 21:47.013
battlefield-surgery crap is not gonna
fly anymore now that I'm here.

21:47.184 --> 21:51.098
You need to step away and stop
acting like you own this place.

21:51.271 --> 21:52.469
I'm doing that amputation.

21:52.647 --> 21:54.973
No, you're gonna wait
until Landry has a chance...

22:03.283 --> 22:05.276
Hey. Break it up.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.440
You hired me. You recruited me
to run the Trauma Department.

22:11.792 --> 22:13.665
There isn't a hospital
in the country...

22:13.835 --> 22:17.335
where an ER doctor makes the call
about what trauma cases go to the OR.

22:17.506 --> 22:19.130
We are not typical ER doctors.

22:19.299 --> 22:21.940
Topher and I have done everything
you have except while under fire.

22:22.094 --> 22:23.837
And Drew?
Drew's a battlefield medic.

22:24.012 --> 22:27.428
- Way ahead of most residents.
- Okay, okay. That's enough.

22:27.599 --> 22:30.220
Nobody is questioning
anybody's credentials.

22:30.394 --> 22:34.012
The problem isn't how good you are,
the problem is how you two get along.

22:35.065 --> 22:38.350
Dr. Alexander.
Just the person I wanted to see.

22:38.527 --> 22:41.693
You head the ER night shift,
so you deal with these egomaniacs...

22:41.863 --> 22:44.568
and I will expect a solution
at the end of the shift.

22:47.786 --> 22:50.787
I didn't wanna bring up personal crap
while Ragosa was here.

22:50.956 --> 22:55.036
But you're out of line. Whatever
happened between you and Jordan...

22:55.210 --> 22:57.001
was years ago, and it is over.

22:57.170 --> 22:58.914
- Scott, this is not the place.
- Okay.

22:59.089 --> 23:01.545
So, you're telling me
how to run my life now?

23:01.717 --> 23:04.468
I'm telling you next time
you need a ride, call a cab.

23:04.636 --> 23:06.677
I'll give you 20 bucks.
Just leave Jordan out of it.

23:06.805 --> 23:09.592
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- T, can you just give us a minute?

23:09.766 --> 23:11.640
Thank you.

23:18.734 --> 23:21.818
I'm sorry. I try, but I don't like him.

23:21.987 --> 23:24.110
I don't like the way
he peacocks around.

23:24.281 --> 23:25.905
I don't like how he talks to you.

23:26.074 --> 23:30.487
And I sure as hell don't like him
calling you for a ride.

23:30.662 --> 23:33.200
He didn't call me for a ride.

23:34.458 --> 23:37.577
- He came by my house.
- He came by your house?

23:37.753 --> 23:38.784
He wanted to talk.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.797
Scott, look. It's been really
weird between the two of us...

23:42.966 --> 23:46.050
- I can't believe you lied.
- I didn't wanna make this a big deal.

23:46.219 --> 23:48.342
Yeah, well, I think
you missed that train.

23:48.513 --> 23:50.340
- Scott, please don't...
- You lied to me.

23:50.515 --> 23:52.804
And you lied to me about him.

23:57.105 --> 23:59.228
You have to stop messing
with Jordan's head.

23:59.399 --> 24:02.733
- I'm not messing with her head.
- You have to let her go.

24:02.903 --> 24:05.026
Toph, she can do
whatever she wants.

24:05.197 --> 24:08.482
- Do not pull that crap on me.
- You know, she's tied to you...

24:08.658 --> 24:13.320
and you to her in your messed up,
co-dependent relationship.

24:13.497 --> 24:15.822
So maybe we should be together.

24:15.999 --> 24:17.908
No. You should not.

24:18.085 --> 24:21.584
Look. I love you, brother,
but at this point in your life...

24:21.755 --> 24:23.675
you don't know
what it means to be a father...

24:23.715 --> 24:25.624
husband, certainly
not a good boyfriend.

24:26.385 --> 24:27.547
And she has a guy.

24:27.719 --> 24:31.717
Maybe he's not our favourite,
but he treats her well.

24:31.890 --> 24:34.642
You really wanna eff
that up for her?

24:34.810 --> 24:37.514
So I should just walk away.

24:38.230 --> 24:41.100
Yeah. Yeah.
What if you're never ready?

24:41.274 --> 24:44.311
What if she gives up
everything for you?

24:44.486 --> 24:45.766
She's done it before.

24:47.114 --> 24:49.569
You really wanna put her
through that again?

24:58.959 --> 25:01.711
Your pregnancy test.
Hot off the presses.

25:01.878 --> 25:04.001
And you are...

25:04.423 --> 25:07.258
Son of a bitch. You're pregnant.

25:07.426 --> 25:08.968
Yes.

25:09.678 --> 25:12.133
I just wish Matt were here
with me for this news.

25:12.305 --> 25:14.215
- He's on location.
- This can't be right.

25:14.391 --> 25:16.964
I gotta call Ben and Jen.
They're gonna be so excited.

25:17.144 --> 25:18.721
They're very invested in this.

25:18.895 --> 25:20.888
And jealous.
Jen loves being pregnant.

25:21.064 --> 25:25.442
You know, you are looking much better
now that we started you on steroids.

25:25.610 --> 25:27.437
No more bleeding.

25:27.612 --> 25:29.605
- How do you feel?
- Better.

25:29.781 --> 25:32.652
Yeah. Not great, but definitely better.

25:32.826 --> 25:34.984
Maybe it's Dr. Krista.

25:36.288 --> 25:38.530
Is there something going on
that I should know?

25:38.707 --> 25:41.791
No, no. I just...
I've been hitting on Dr. Krista...

25:41.960 --> 25:44.416
but she told me we can't go out.

25:44.588 --> 25:46.711
Well, you know,
I was thinking about it...

25:46.882 --> 25:50.048
and technically,
I'm not his doctor of record.

25:50.218 --> 25:53.837
I see where you're going. I am your
official doctor of record, PFC...

25:54.014 --> 25:55.923
so you and I couldn't go out, but...

25:56.099 --> 25:58.769
Oh, well, no offence, sir,
but you're not my type.

25:59.895 --> 26:03.679
- Wilson's not anybody's type.
- Well, guess again, Pirate...

26:03.857 --> 26:06.313
because Wilson and
I are gonna go get a beer.

26:06.485 --> 26:07.516
- Wait, what?
- Really?

26:07.694 --> 26:11.229
Now we've cleared those technicalities,
I don't see why we can't go out.

26:11.406 --> 26:13.695
Oh, yes. Yes.

26:13.867 --> 26:15.527
I told you guys I was a ladies' man.

26:17.079 --> 26:18.739
Come on. Let's hear it for Wilson.

26:18.914 --> 26:22.164
Wilson, Wilson, Wilson.

26:22.334 --> 26:24.373
Captain Rick's like my big brother.

26:24.544 --> 26:27.415
Wilson. Wilson. Wilson.

26:27.589 --> 26:31.836
Well, looks like everybody's
feeling better so let's all clear out.

26:32.010 --> 26:34.299
Give the captain
some privacy for his exam.

26:34.471 --> 26:36.629
I've seen his ass
a million times already.

26:36.807 --> 26:39.048
- A beauty, isn't it?
- Oh, it's perfectly formed.

26:39.226 --> 26:42.725
- I almost took a shot at it myself.
- I got a secret for you.

26:42.896 --> 26:45.019
The whirlpool up in rehab?

26:45.190 --> 26:47.479
Totally empty right now.
And the nurses?

26:47.651 --> 26:49.560
They would love to hear...

26:49.736 --> 26:51.943
how you guys kicked
Osama Bin Laden's ass.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.482
- I'm sorry, bro, but duty calls.
- Yeah, yeah.

26:59.371 --> 27:01.778
It's impossible to get those guys
out of here.

27:04.334 --> 27:06.908
- What's the story on my leg, Drew?
- I'm not sure.

27:07.087 --> 27:09.957
Tell me the truth. I pretend all day.
Don't pretend with me.

27:10.132 --> 27:13.216
I don't know.
The surgeon's on his way.

27:13.552 --> 27:15.212
- You're lying to me.
- I'm not lying.

27:15.387 --> 27:17.130
I don't know. Okay?

27:17.305 --> 27:19.512
- It'll be okay.
- Don't tell me it'll be okay.

27:19.683 --> 27:22.008
Four tours in Afghanistan,
splinter and a sunburn.

27:22.185 --> 27:24.392
I'm back for an afternoon, and this?

27:24.896 --> 27:27.518
We were supposed
to go hiking tomorrow.

27:27.691 --> 27:29.933
Whatever happens,
we will deal with it.

27:30.110 --> 27:33.230
What is this, "we"? This is my leg.

27:33.405 --> 27:35.481
You go back to that
when your shift's over.

27:35.657 --> 27:37.484
What, you think I don't care?

27:39.870 --> 27:42.361
Good evening, captain.

27:42.539 --> 27:44.697
Give us a minute?
I'd like to examine his leg.

27:44.875 --> 27:48.919
I'd like to stay, if that's okay?
I haven't seen an injury like this before.

27:49.504 --> 27:51.793
- Yeah.
- Sure. Why not.

28:05.062 --> 28:07.553
I'm sorry.
We need to get you to the OR.

28:07.731 --> 28:09.558
- To do what?
- We need to amputate.

28:09.733 --> 28:12.141
Dr. Callahan's procedure didn't take.

28:12.319 --> 28:14.276
The leg is necrotic. It's already dying.

28:14.446 --> 28:17.696
You'll become septic if we don't.
We can't let that happen.

28:17.866 --> 28:20.155
- You said it would work.
- I said it might.

28:20.327 --> 28:22.319
It was a Hail Mary, Rick.

28:22.496 --> 28:24.535
- We had to try something.
- No.

28:25.874 --> 28:27.285
You're not gonna take my leg.

28:27.459 --> 28:29.416
- Captain.
- Get out of here, both of you.

28:29.586 --> 28:30.665
- Rick.
- Get out.

28:31.254 --> 28:33.461
I would rather die than lose my leg.

28:34.841 --> 28:36.799
- Rick, we...
- I said get out.

28:46.978 --> 28:49.220
Ms. Palmer,
you're going to feel some pressure.

28:49.398 --> 28:51.106
I remember you.

28:51.274 --> 28:53.944
You're the one who loved
<i>The Talented Mr. Ripley.</i>

28:54.111 --> 28:56.103
- Yeah. Sure.
- Great movie.

28:56.279 --> 28:57.904
I've got news for you.

28:58.448 --> 29:00.322
This is Matt Damon's baby.

29:01.159 --> 29:03.033
- Crazy, huh?
- Sure is.

29:03.203 --> 29:05.243
Okay. Just try and hold still please.

29:10.794 --> 29:13.629
- Landry?
- Is it a boy or a girl?

29:13.797 --> 29:16.466
You know what, Ms. Palmer.
Let us run some tests.

29:17.050 --> 29:20.715
Sure. Doctors don't like to guess.
I don't care either way.

29:20.887 --> 29:22.761
Okay. Thank you.

29:22.931 --> 29:24.888
- We're done.
- I'd like a boy for Matt.

29:25.058 --> 29:28.759
The first one, anyway.
But I don't really care, but I think a boy.

29:30.313 --> 29:33.599
I'm not 100-percent sure,
but that looks like an ovarian tumour.

29:33.775 --> 29:35.851
Could explain the false positive.

29:36.028 --> 29:37.486
- Let's get a CT. Okay?
- Thanks.

29:37.654 --> 29:41.782
Hey, so the whole Scott and TC thing.
If you wanna talk...

29:41.950 --> 29:43.943
Yeah. That whole fight thing
was just...

29:44.119 --> 29:48.033
Well, I wasn't talking about the fight.
I was talking about the situation.

29:48.457 --> 29:50.248
Thank you, Landry.

29:50.417 --> 29:55.624
- It's just... It might be a little weird.
- Yeah. No. I guess it kind of would.

29:55.797 --> 29:58.335
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

29:58.508 --> 30:02.127
He had me get you
because he heard you were a Ranger.

30:02.304 --> 30:05.969
So were you actually in
Kandahar when the battle went down?

30:06.141 --> 30:07.849
In the med tent. Yeah.

30:08.018 --> 30:11.553
But close enough
to catch a whiff of the poo-pond.

30:14.816 --> 30:16.097
Have those gotten bigger?

30:16.276 --> 30:18.316
Those lesions
aren't typical for an ITP.

30:18.487 --> 30:22.354
Could be bug bites or infected
abrasion that we didn't notice.

30:22.532 --> 30:24.442
- Well, they're really itchy.
- Okay.

30:24.618 --> 30:27.903
I'll order some Benadryl and check back.
See if the swelling's down.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.864
And maybe Dr. Krista can stop back
by again later?

30:32.042 --> 30:33.702
Yes. I will make sure she comes by.

30:33.877 --> 30:36.368
Okay. All right.

30:36.546 --> 30:39.216
- You got a minute to talk, Toph?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:42.469 --> 30:44.545
I got some responses
to my new profile.

30:44.721 --> 30:48.422
Oh, yeah? Let me take a look.
Let me take a look.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.934
Let me see.
Oh, no. No, not that one.

30:52.312 --> 30:55.646
What? Well, why not?
I thought she looked pretty sexy.

30:55.816 --> 30:58.567
She's in profile. Hot girls
show you the whole enchilada.

30:58.735 --> 31:00.313
What are you guys doing?

31:00.862 --> 31:05.275
Nothing, just, you know,
some work stuff. You know?

31:05.450 --> 31:06.529
Okay.

31:07.577 --> 31:09.819
Kenny, if Palmer's
sister calls, please get me.

31:09.996 --> 31:12.701
- I'll be in Trauma 4 with Captain Lincoln.
- Okay. Got it.

31:17.129 --> 31:20.462
Oh, my God, you dirty dog.
You got a thing for Landry.

31:20.632 --> 31:23.088
- Oh, please.
- You got a thing for Landry.

31:23.260 --> 31:27.554
She's a co-worker.
And she's way out of my league.

31:27.723 --> 31:29.300
Of course she is.

31:29.474 --> 31:31.681
But that does not mean
you can't like her.

31:31.852 --> 31:33.560
Plenty of ugly dudes with hot chicks.

31:33.729 --> 31:36.765
Thanks for the compliment.
You know what?

31:36.940 --> 31:39.265
I'm responding to this one.
She seemed nice.

31:39.443 --> 31:43.025
<i>Dr. Cummings, please report to Rehab.
Dr. Cummings to Rehab.</i>

31:43.196 --> 31:44.607
- What's going on?
- It's Pirate.

31:44.781 --> 31:47.272
- We were stupid.
- Thought it'd be funny if I jumped in.

31:47.451 --> 31:49.443
- He slammed his eye.
- It's killing me.

31:49.619 --> 31:52.704
It's a retro orbital hematoma,
bleeding behind your eye. Okay?

31:53.290 --> 31:57.122
Look. I've texted downstairs.
Let's get him out. Okay?

31:58.337 --> 32:01.587
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no.
No, don't touch me. Don't touch me.

32:02.382 --> 32:05.751
It's black. It's black. It's black.
I can't see anything.

32:05.927 --> 32:07.635
Come on, Doogie, you gotta help me.

32:07.804 --> 32:10.046
- We need a doctor.
- Aren't you a doctor?

32:10.223 --> 32:13.343
- You gotta help me. Help me, Doogie.
- Okay, okay, okay.

32:13.518 --> 32:14.894
I'm on it.

32:16.146 --> 32:19.645
I'm nothing without my leg.
You know, I'm a jock.

32:19.816 --> 32:24.194
I'm a soldier. I'm Army.
I lead men. That's what I do.

32:24.363 --> 32:26.549
Is that what you're afraid the surgery
will take away from you?

32:26.573 --> 32:29.823
- Yeah. Yeah, I might as well be dead.
- That's ridiculous.

32:29.993 --> 32:32.994
With today's prosthetics
you can do anything anybody else can.

32:33.163 --> 32:35.452
You know what? Stay out of this.

32:36.917 --> 32:39.455
I think he's worried
about whether people...

32:39.628 --> 32:41.620
will still respond to him
the same way.

32:41.797 --> 32:44.085
And they will.
Your platoon loves you.

32:44.633 --> 32:47.005
They respect you.
They'll always be there for you.

32:47.177 --> 32:49.383
- That's easy to say now.
- Now is all we have.

32:49.554 --> 32:51.880
You want a crystal ball?
I don't have one.

32:52.057 --> 32:54.382
Can't ask people
to promise the future like that.

32:54.559 --> 32:56.400
- Doesn't work like that.
- This is ridiculous.

32:56.436 --> 32:58.725
I'm deciding between
losing my leg and dying...

32:58.897 --> 33:02.396
and we're talking
in these stupid riddles?

33:02.567 --> 33:04.940
You do know
what's going on between us?

33:05.112 --> 33:07.318
- Right, doctor?
- Rick. Don't.

33:07.489 --> 33:09.446
No. Tell her. Come on, tough guy.

33:09.616 --> 33:11.858
- Rick, stop.
- Now who's afraid of something?

33:12.035 --> 33:14.491
It's not so fun, is it?

33:17.874 --> 33:20.496
I got another patient. I gotta go.

33:24.214 --> 33:26.919
He needs a lateral canthotomy.
He just lost his vision.

33:27.384 --> 33:30.468
Okay. You can handle this.
I'm gonna talk you through it.

33:31.346 --> 33:32.377
Come on.

33:33.890 --> 33:35.848
I need you to stop.
I need you to stop.

33:36.393 --> 33:39.477
Look. Trust me. I can do this, all right?
Just be still.

33:42.399 --> 33:44.190
Okay.

33:45.402 --> 33:46.433
Okay.

33:58.915 --> 34:03.209
Okay. Crimp the lateral skin with
the hemostat down to the orbital rim.

34:03.962 --> 34:06.963
Very good. Now locate
the lateral cantus tendon.

34:09.009 --> 34:10.585
And snip.

34:16.266 --> 34:17.926
- Very good.
- I can see again.

34:18.101 --> 34:19.893
Well done, Dr. Cummings.

34:20.312 --> 34:22.186
Thank you, Doogie.

34:22.731 --> 34:23.762
Yeah.

34:25.359 --> 34:26.521
Okay.

34:28.320 --> 34:31.771
Hey. So Is the department
finally down to normal flow?

34:31.947 --> 34:34.902
- More or less.
- Good. Good.

34:35.077 --> 34:37.828
- Jordan, I need to talk to you.
- I was looking for...

34:37.996 --> 34:40.072
Your people aren't restocking
trauma rooms.

34:40.248 --> 34:43.368
There was one thoracotomy tray
and two chest tubes in Trauma 1.

34:43.543 --> 34:46.117
What if we had another
multi-casualty event?

34:46.295 --> 34:49.001
- I'll take care of it. Scott.
- Thank you.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.545
Can we please talk?
I really wanna fix this.

34:51.717 --> 34:54.553
Let's just get through the shift.

34:59.601 --> 35:02.935
So I was thinking we could
maybe go bowling or ice skating.

35:03.105 --> 35:05.062
- You ever been ice skating?
- Sounds fun.

35:05.607 --> 35:10.483
- Hey. How are you feeling?
- Sort of lousy.

35:10.654 --> 35:13.323
- I'm really itchy and hot.
- Let's take this blanket off.

35:18.954 --> 35:20.033
Topher. Topher.

35:22.749 --> 35:26.414
- His temperature is 103.
- It's not ITP.

35:26.586 --> 35:29.077
- He has visceral leishmaniasis.
- Visceral what?

35:29.256 --> 35:32.091
- What is that?
- I saw a mild case in Afghanistan.

35:32.259 --> 35:34.168
He must have caught it
from sand flies.

35:34.344 --> 35:36.218
The steroids.
Gotta unhook the steroids.

35:36.388 --> 35:37.882
- BP's dropping.
- Wilson?

35:38.056 --> 35:40.049
- Save him, Topher.
- Quick. The crash cart.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.388
Wilson.

35:42.269 --> 35:45.804
Out of the way, out of the way.
Move. Coming through, coming through.

35:45.981 --> 35:47.808
I'm here. Come on, guys.
Let's move it.

35:47.983 --> 35:50.735
Let's give the doctors room
to work. Out, now.

35:50.902 --> 35:52.729
Another milligram
of epi and Lidocaine.

35:52.904 --> 35:55.442
And add two amps of bicarb
and charge to 360.

35:55.615 --> 35:56.896
- Clear.
- Clear.

35:57.075 --> 35:59.032
Wilson. What's going on? Wilson.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.865
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, come on.

36:07.169 --> 36:08.960
Stop. Stop compressions.

36:14.301 --> 36:18.085
It's been 35 minutes
without spontaneous circulation.

36:19.931 --> 36:21.805
It's time to stop, Krista.

36:24.644 --> 36:25.676
Damn it.

36:28.482 --> 36:30.142
Five thirty-one a.m.

36:35.864 --> 36:37.192
Five thirty-one.

36:52.714 --> 36:54.790
Drew, I'm scared.

36:54.966 --> 36:57.089
I'm booking the surgery.

36:57.260 --> 37:00.676
And I swear, I will drug you
and do it myself if you don't agree to it.

37:04.059 --> 37:05.850
Okay.

37:06.561 --> 37:08.186
Okay.

37:15.404 --> 37:18.523
- Drew.
- I can't. I can't.

37:21.076 --> 37:25.370
I'm sorry, but you have to prep
for a surgery.

37:25.539 --> 37:28.077
Soldiers, it's time to clear out.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.657
The captain's gotta go to surgery.

37:30.919 --> 37:32.579
I'm sorry.

37:47.310 --> 37:48.853
Scott.

37:53.025 --> 37:55.598
- I'm really sorry.
- I know you are.

37:55.777 --> 37:59.526
This whole thing seems a little
silly after seeing that poor kid.

38:00.115 --> 38:02.024
Just don't ever lie to me again.

38:04.327 --> 38:06.486
See you back at your place
after the surgery.

38:06.663 --> 38:08.241
Yeah.

38:10.250 --> 38:13.749
- So I'm not pregnant.
- No. I'm sorry.

38:14.588 --> 38:16.248
But your tumour is very treatable.

38:16.423 --> 38:19.044
We're pretty sure that's
causing your psychotic states.

38:19.217 --> 38:21.424
Dr. De la Cruz,
Miss Palmer's sister is here.

38:21.595 --> 38:25.295
- Jessie? Oh, my God, Jessie.
- Oh, my God, Marcie.

38:25.474 --> 38:27.715
Oh, the doctor told me.

38:27.893 --> 38:29.885
It's not my fault.
None of it is my fault.

38:30.062 --> 38:33.596
- I know. I know. I'm so sorry.
- Me too.

38:33.774 --> 38:35.897
You never got to meet Matt.

38:59.341 --> 39:02.176
The steroids that I ordered
took down the inflammation...

39:02.344 --> 39:04.917
but it suppressed
his immune system.

39:05.097 --> 39:07.385
We all agreed to treatment
based on what we had.

39:07.557 --> 39:10.095
He was a dead man
before he even left Afghanistan.

39:10.394 --> 39:12.967
There's nothing anyone
could have done, Topher.

39:38.296 --> 39:40.752
Jordan. Come on.

39:41.758 --> 39:43.300
I wanna talk about this morning.

39:43.468 --> 39:46.173
- You don't have to say anything.
- I'm sorry I dropped by.

39:46.346 --> 39:47.805
I'm sorry for that, but...

39:48.890 --> 39:51.808
I'm not sorry for what happened.
When we kissed...

39:51.977 --> 39:53.720
you didn't stop when I started.

39:53.895 --> 39:57.478
And so I know
that you felt something.

39:57.649 --> 40:01.896
But I won't say anything to Scott
because...

40:02.571 --> 40:06.106
I don't want to ruin that for you.
If that's who you want.

40:06.283 --> 40:07.611
If not...

40:08.076 --> 40:10.235
you know where to find me.

40:10.746 --> 40:11.991
That's it.

40:19.129 --> 40:20.956
He's ready for surgery,
Dr. Clemmens.

40:25.677 --> 40:29.675
Captain. I want you to know we're
gonna make this absolutely painless...

40:29.848 --> 40:32.553
and we're gonna save
as much of your leg as possible.

40:32.726 --> 40:36.142
Soon as it's done, we're gonna get
you on the best prosthetics we have.

40:36.313 --> 40:39.646
I called a buddy of mine at the Intrepid,
so they'll be expecting you.

40:39.816 --> 40:41.061
Thank you.

40:42.903 --> 40:45.773
- Go with him, he's terrified.
- I can't.

40:45.947 --> 40:47.192
Not in front of them.

40:47.366 --> 40:50.699
Well, then don't you ever tell me
how tough you are again.

40:50.869 --> 40:51.948
Do you understand?

40:52.287 --> 40:55.905
All that MMA talk, all that
Ranger talk, it doesn't mean crap...

40:56.083 --> 40:58.490
if you let him
go through this alone?

41:00.962 --> 41:03.999
Captain, what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

41:06.385 --> 41:07.795
You're not alone, captain.

41:09.596 --> 41:12.716
As soon as we get you upstairs,
we're gonna get you sedated...

41:12.891 --> 41:14.634
put you under general anaesthesia.

41:14.810 --> 41:16.601
You're not gonna feel a thing. Okay?

41:19.690 --> 41:21.148
Hold it.

41:30.409 --> 41:32.615
I'm gonna be there for you.

41:34.121 --> 41:35.781
I promise.

41:37.999 --> 41:39.328
I love you.

41:45.132 --> 41:46.330
Me too.
