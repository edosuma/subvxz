WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:08.342
( music playing )

00:17.085 --> 00:19.753
- OH, WAIT.
- WHAT, LADY?

00:19.853 --> 00:23.257
- RENT IS DUE NEXT WEEK.
- YEAH, AND I GOT IT COVERED.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.093
WHENEVER YOU SAY THAT,
I GET THE DISTINCT FEELING

00:25.193 --> 00:26.760
THAT YOU DON'T
GOT IT COVERED.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.729
YOU'RE GONNA TELL
YOUR PARENTS YOU LOST
YOUR JOB, RIGHT?

00:28.829 --> 00:31.665
I DIDN'T LOSE MY JOB.
I GAVE MY JOB AWAY
OF MY OWN VOLITION

00:31.765 --> 00:34.602
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT A FUCKING BREAST
MASSAGE EVERY DAY.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.371
- YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?
- NO. NO, NOT AT ALL.

00:37.471 --> 00:41.942
- BYE!
- BE NICE TO YOUR
PARENTS, OKAY?

00:42.042 --> 00:46.046
I'M THE NICEST!
( kisses )

00:48.882 --> 00:51.452
( plane roaring )

00:53.221 --> 00:54.788
I THINK SHE MISSED
HER FLIGHT.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.158
- NO, SHE MADE HER FLIGHT.
SHE MADE HER FLIGHT.
- NO.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.395
AH! AH!
( laughs )

01:01.495 --> 01:04.265
OH, HEY! HEY!
WORKING GIRL!

01:04.364 --> 01:07.368
- ( chuckling )
- LOOK, HANNAH BANANA.

01:07.468 --> 01:10.504
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
- I WAS WAITING AT
BAGGAGE CLAIM.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.273
OH, HERE.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.476
MOMMY, HI!

01:15.576 --> 01:17.778
- HOW ARE YOU?
- MY BABY GIRL.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.513
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- OH!

01:19.613 --> 01:23.083
- OH, HONEY.
- I'M-- THAT'S-- I'M SORRY.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.686
- NO, I CAN--
- DAD.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.888
WELL, WE'RE JUST SO GLAD
THAT YOU'RE BACK, HONEY,

01:27.988 --> 01:29.190
EVEN IF IT'S JUST
FOR THE WEEKEND.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.991
WE ARE.
WE ARE SO GLAD.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.761
WHEN WE WERE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY--

01:33.861 --> 01:35.929
WE THOUGHT, "WHO BETTER
TO SPEND IT WITH THAN
OUR BEST FRIEND

01:36.029 --> 01:38.599
- WHO WE JUST
HAPPENED TO CREATE?"
- YEAH, WELL, 30 YEARS.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.934
I CAN'T IMAGINE GETTING SOMEONE
TO SPEND 30 YEARS WITH ME.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.003
30 MINUTES SEEMS CRAZY.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.872
HOW'S THAT ADAM FELLOW?

01:44.972 --> 01:46.307
UH, DEAD TO ME.

01:46.407 --> 01:49.377
- Loreen: AND THE JOB?
- OH, UM, SAME.

01:49.477 --> 01:52.246
I MEAN, BORING,
BUT IT'S A JOB, SO...

01:52.346 --> 01:54.248
WE WERE JUST HEARING THAT
M.S.U. WAS LOOKING FOR

01:54.348 --> 01:57.084
A POSTGRADUATE FELLOW TO
ORGANIZE VISITING LECTURERS.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.719
FOLKS WHO COME AND LECTURE.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.355
- DOESN'T THAT SOUND LIKE
AN INTERESTING JOB?
- SOUNDS GREAT.

02:01.455 --> 02:05.125
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS
ALL WEEKEND, JUST DON'T.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.163
WE HAVE SOME FUN NETFLIX

02:09.263 --> 02:11.399
AND SOME GREAT FOOD.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.668
SOME CURRIED VEGETABLES,
RICE PUDDING.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.070
- YOU GOT THE RICE PUDDING?
- YEAH. HAM CROQUETTE.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.340
Man over TV:
These are my sleeping socks.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.975
My feet like a little air
at night.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.778
Man £2:
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

02:24.878 --> 02:27.981
Man:
'Cause my daytime socks got
too many holes in them.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.583
OH, HONEY, DON'T TEXT.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.519
YOU CAN TEXT WHEN
THE MOVIE'S OVER.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.954
BUT I DON'T CARE WHAT
HAPPENS DURING THE MOVIE.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.389
WELL, WE DO.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.691
WELL, THAT'S REALLY
YOUR CROSS TO BEAR.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.728
- OOH, YOU'VE GOT A MOOD ON.
- NO, I DON'T.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.130
MAYBE SHE'S HUNGRY.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.065
OKAY...

02:45.165 --> 02:47.134
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
I SAID I WASN'T HUNGRY.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.936
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.738
HONEY?

02:50.838 --> 02:53.574
THERE'S SOME CHICKEN
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.511
WHAT DID I SAY?

03:07.221 --> 03:09.557
( cell phone chimes )

04:04.011 --> 04:05.746
- HANNAH?
- MMM?

04:05.846 --> 04:07.981
- HANNAH?
- MMM?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.384
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

04:10.484 --> 04:12.185
WHAT TIME IS IT, MOM?

04:12.286 --> 04:14.955
11:00.
I NEED MY PRESCRIPTION.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.790
WELL, CAN DAD GET IT?

04:16.890 --> 04:19.660
NO, HE'S ALREADY GONE OUT.
I'M SORRY, I LET IT GO
ON A LITTLE LONG.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.029
I'M HAVING HORRIBLE
HOT FLASHES.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.866
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA--
JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE MINUTES.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.669
NO, NOW,
HANNAH, NOW.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.472
PLEASE, HANNAH!

04:32.806 --> 04:34.442
( sighs )

04:51.459 --> 04:53.160
YOU'RE SUCH A SWEETHEART.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.729
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING AND CHEERING ME UP.
- TOTALLY.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.433
- OH, MY GOD, HANNAH?
- HI!

04:59.533 --> 05:00.668
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

05:00.768 --> 05:03.236
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
OH, MY GOD!

05:03.337 --> 05:06.039
- HI.
- HI. WHAT'S UP, GIRL?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.376
NOTHING. I JUST WANTED
TO COME SAY HI BECAUSE
I'M HOME FOR THE WEEKEND.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.844
YEAH. OH, YOU'RE HERE
FOR THE BENEFIT.

05:10.944 --> 05:14.348
NO, FOR MY
PARENTS' ANNIVERSARY.
WHAT'S THE BENEFIT?

05:14.448 --> 05:16.850
- FOR KERI?
- KERI...?

05:18.085 --> 05:20.521
OH, SHIT. OH, SHIT.
OKAY.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.255
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE BENEFIT FOR KERI.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.657
SWEETHEART, WE GOTTA TALK.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.793
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU ANY
FUCKING COFFEE DRINK

05:25.893 --> 05:27.428
THAT YOU WANT
IN THIS ENTIRE PLACE--

05:27.528 --> 05:30.498
WE'RE OUT OF SOY MILK--
AND WE'RE GONNA TALK.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.900
SO ON THE LAST DAY
OF THE TRIP,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.236
THEY JUST THOUGHT SHE
WAS IN THAT GUY'S HOTEL
ROOM, YOU KNOW?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.572
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
"KERI BETTER GET BACK HERE

05:38.672 --> 05:40.374
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT CLEANING
UP HER DIRTY UNDERWEAR."

05:40.474 --> 05:43.310
AND THEN THEY THOUGHT
SHE WAS JUST, LIKE,

05:43.411 --> 05:46.146
HUNG OVER AND NOT ANSWERING
HER PHONE OR WHATEVER.

05:46.246 --> 05:49.483
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
"FINE, BITCH IS GONNA STAY
AT THE RESORT, THEN."

05:49.583 --> 05:51.585
SO THEY WENT TO THE AIRPORT,

05:51.685 --> 05:56.123
AND WHEN THEY GOT
OFF OF THE PLANE,
THEY COULDN'T REACH HER.

05:56.223 --> 05:59.660
AND THEN
THEY REALIZED, LIKE--

06:01.762 --> 06:04.465
THEY REALIZED THEY
COULD NEVER REACH HER.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.468
WOW.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.638
AND SHE JUST RESPECTED
INDIVIDUALITY, YOU KNOW?

06:10.738 --> 06:13.273
LIKE YOU,
LIKE THE WAY YOU'RE ALWAYS
DOING YOUR OWN THING,

06:13.373 --> 06:15.443
WEARING TWO DIFFERENT
COLORED SOCKS

06:15.543 --> 06:17.878
AND JUST BEING YOU.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.448
SHE LOVED YOU FOR THAT.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.450
SHE LOVED UNIQUE.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.252
SO, THE BENEFIT'S LIKE
SOMETHING YOU'RE DOING FOR
HER MEMORIAL FUND, OR...

06:25.352 --> 06:26.854
MORE LIKE FOR HER PARENTS,

06:26.954 --> 06:29.056
BECAUSE THEY WANNA HIRE
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.824
- GET SOME CLOSURE.
- YEAH.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.260
- HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT, YUM?
- YEAH.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.763
OH, YEAH.
I'M-- THANKS, YEAH.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.131
IT'S JUST REALLY INTENSE
TO HAVE TO TELL HANNAH

06:38.231 --> 06:39.600
ABOUT THIS KERI STUFF,
YOU KNOW?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.401
OH, YEAH.
YOU DID GOOD, YUM.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.137
- YOU DID RIGHT.
- THANK YOU.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.441
- ZACH, THIS IS HANNAH.
- HEY.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.577
- HANNAH, THIS IS ZACH.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.211
AND HE'S BEEN
SO GREAT ABOUT THIS STUFF.

06:51.311 --> 06:54.482
OH, THIS KERI SHIT.
GOD, SHE BASICALLY
HAS P.T.S.D.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.084
YEAH, AND HE'S BEEN SO
SUPPORTIVE ABOUT THE FACT
THAT I'M MOVING.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.619
YOU'RE MOVING?

06:58.719 --> 07:01.321
THIS LITTLE LAMP IS HEADING
TO HOLLYWOOD NEXT WEEK.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.390
YEAH, TO DANCE.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.658
SO YOU KNOW SOMEONE
WHO'S GOING TO HELP YOU

07:04.758 --> 07:06.460
GET SETTLED
AND FIND AUDITIONS?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.696
OH, NO. YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW

07:08.796 --> 07:10.731
THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE
TO KNOW ANYBODY. YOU KNOW?

07:10.831 --> 07:13.333
- YEAH.
- Zach: OKAY, YOU'RE OFF
BREAK, PLUMMY.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.368
OKAY, SQUIRT.

07:15.469 --> 07:19.106
OKAY, SQUIRT!
( chuckles )

07:34.454 --> 07:37.390
Man: YOU WENT TO
EAST LANSING HIGH.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.227
- YEAH, I DID. YOU...
- CLASS OF '06.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.596
YEAH, ERIC.
I REMEMBER.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.731
HEY.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.734
YEAH, YOU-- YOU WROTE
THE ADVICE COLUMN.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.402
IT WAS FOR THE PAPER.
"HOLLER AT HANNAH"?

07:49.503 --> 07:51.505
IT WAS ACTUALLY
"HOLLA AT HANNAH."

07:51.605 --> 07:54.474
IF YOU WANNA BE CORRECT.
BUT THAT'S MORTIFYING.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.643
YOU STILL DO THAT?

07:55.743 --> 07:57.545
NOT PROFESSIONALLY
ANY LONGER.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.080
NO, NOT A PROFESSIONAL
ADVICE GIVER. ( chuckles )

08:00.180 --> 08:02.149
I LIVE IN NEW YORK.
I'M ACTUALLY JUST HOME
FOR THE WEEKEND.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.717
COOL.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.656
( chuckles )

08:09.890 --> 08:11.559
SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU WORKED HERE?

08:11.659 --> 08:13.761
UH, I OWN IT
WITH MY DAD.

08:13.861 --> 08:14.928
OH, COOL.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.664
WELL, I OWN A SMALL
SAVINGS BOND WITH MY DAD,

08:16.764 --> 08:18.699
- SO IT'S KIND
OF THE SAME THING.
- ( laughs )

08:19.332 --> 08:21.201
UM, OKAY.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.671
- $23.
- ( register beeping )

08:23.771 --> 08:25.338
LET'S SEE, I THINK
I ONLY HAVE A 20,

08:25.438 --> 08:27.340
SO I WILL SACRIFICE
THOSE PANTY HOSE.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.309
COME ON,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.311
- YOU SURE?
- YEAH, REALLY.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.613
THANK YOU.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.548
I STILL WANT THAT 20.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.650
- ( both laughing )
- SORRY.

08:37.618 --> 08:41.054
- THANK YOU.
- AWESOME.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.556
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS, HAVE A GREAT ONE.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.357
- YOU, TOO.
- LATER.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.227
( singing with radio )
* THESE HANDS ARE SMALL,
I KNOW... *

08:47.327 --> 08:50.297
- HANNAH!
- * BUT THEY'RE NOT YOURS,
THEY ARE MY-- *

08:50.397 --> 08:52.032
- HEY.
- HI.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.668
THOSE HORMONE REPLACEMENTS
FOR YOUR MOM--

08:54.768 --> 08:56.804
NO, THOSE ARE MY MOM'S.
THEY'RE NOT MINE.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.138
RIGHT.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.574
SOME WOMEN FEEL THAT THEY
NEED A PERSONAL LUBRICANT

09:00.674 --> 09:02.309
WHILE ON THOSE,
SO...

09:02.409 --> 09:04.578
- OH.
- I JUST-- FREE OF CHARGE.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.681
THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY
CONSIDERATE OF YOU.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.982
ARE YOU IN TOWN FOR LONG?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.018
NO, I'M JUST HERE
UNTIL TOMORROW.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.253
I'M WORKING ON A BOOK
IN NEW YORK, SO I KINDA
GOTTA GET BACK.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.322
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

09:17.557 --> 09:19.492
- NOTHING.
- ARE YOU AROUND?

09:19.593 --> 09:22.529
YEAH.
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU?

09:22.630 --> 09:24.297
YEAH, SURE.
( chuckles )

09:24.397 --> 09:27.334
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.737
SOMETHING SPECIFIC OR...

09:29.837 --> 09:34.107
I'M NOT SURE.
THERE'S THAT KERI
LAWRENCE BENEFIT, RIGHT?

09:34.207 --> 09:35.542
YES, SHE DISAPPEARED.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.277
DID YOU KNOW HER?

09:37.377 --> 09:38.879
VERY LITTLE BIT.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.548
- OKAY, GOOD.
- APPARENTLY SHE REALLY
LIKED ME.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.316
- THAT'S SAD.
- VERY.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.085
- I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.
- YEP.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.319
- BYE.
- BYE.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.789
Man:
ALL RIGHT, THAT WORKS!

09:52.559 --> 09:53.927
SHE DIDN'T LOOK
DANGEROUS AT ALL.

09:54.027 --> 09:57.030
AND SHE LITERALLY LIKE
SCREAMED WHEN SHE SAW HER.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.799
- HI.
- OH, OH.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.035
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- OKAY.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.737
Loreen:
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, SWEETIE.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.506
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN
FOR TONIGHT?

10:06.606 --> 10:09.977
- WELL, I MADE A RESERVATION
AT S'IL VOUS PLATE...
- OHH.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.512
AT 7:00 AND MAYBE
A MOVIE AFTERWARDS?

10:12.612 --> 10:15.115
- OUI, OUI.
- YOU KNOW, GUYS,
I WAS THINKING...

10:15.215 --> 10:18.686
AND I DON'T REALLY FEEL
COMFORTABLE ENCROACHING
ON THIS WHOLE THING.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.788
I FEEL LIKE YOU TWO REALLY
NEED TO SPEND THE NIGHT

10:20.888 --> 10:22.522
ALONE TOGETHER.
DOESN'T THAT MAKE MORE SENSE?

10:22.622 --> 10:23.757
WELL, THAT'S VERY SWEET
OF YOU, DOLL.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.325
BUT WE JUST WANT TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO

10:25.425 --> 10:27.661
AND ENJOY YOUR
SHINING PERSONALITY.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.863
I GOT ASKED ON A DATE.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.564
- OH?
- WHAT? WHERE?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.867
AT THE PHARMACY
BY THE PHARMACIST, ERIC.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.736
HE'S CUTE.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.771
HE'S REALLY CUTE,
AND HE'S GONNA TAKE ME

10:37.871 --> 10:40.107
TO THE BENEFIT FOR
KERI LAWRENCE'S FAMILY.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.743
OH, THAT WAS AN
UNFORTUNATE THING.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.045
- BUT WE HAD A PLAN.
- YEAH, WE DID.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.681
I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT
YOU GUYS ARE UNDERSTANDING

10:47.781 --> 10:49.616
THE SEVERITY OF
THIS SITUATION.

10:49.717 --> 10:52.986
I HAVE BEEN DATING SOMEONE
WHO TREATS MY HEART LIKE
IT'S MONKEY MEAT.

10:53.086 --> 10:57.057
I FEEL LIKE A DELUSIONAL,
INVISIBLE PERSON HALF THE TIME.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.727
SO I NEED TO LEARN WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE TREATED WELL

10:59.827 --> 11:01.261
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.163
- GO, GO.
- WHAT?

11:03.263 --> 11:05.866
JUST GO WITH ERIC.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.276
YOU ARE FROM NEW YORK,

11:16.376 --> 11:19.112
THEREFORE YOU ARE JUST
NATURALLY INTERESTING.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.347
OKAY?

11:20.447 --> 11:23.250
IT IS NOT UP TO YOU TO FILL
ALL OF THE PAUSES.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.720
YOU ARE NOT IN DANGER
OF MORTIFYING YOURSELF.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.157
THE WORST STUFF THAT YOU SAY

11:30.257 --> 11:34.227
SOUNDS BETTER THAN
THE BEST STUFF THAT SOME
OTHER PEOPLE SAY.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.333
Eric:
IS THAT OKAY THAT I TOOK
YOU TO A PIZZA PLACE?

11:40.433 --> 11:41.802
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.336
YEAH, I LOVE PIZZA.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.372
I LOVE PEPPERONI, WHICH
I HAVEN'T EATEN IN AGES

11:45.472 --> 11:47.640
BECAUSE I WAS A VEGETARIAN
UNTIL TWO MONTHS AGO.

11:47.741 --> 11:51.044
WHAT? WHY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:51.144 --> 11:53.346
WELL, I WILL TELL
YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.083
( laughs )
WHICH IS BASICALLY,
I WAS DATING THIS GUY--

11:56.183 --> 11:57.818
SORRY IF THAT'S
AN OVERSHARE--

11:57.918 --> 11:59.386
AND I WENT OVER TO HIS HOUSE
ONE DAY AND I WAS STARVING,

11:59.486 --> 12:01.088
AND HE HAD NOTHING TO EAT.

12:01.188 --> 12:04.391
JUST NOTHING EXCEPT
FOR SOME RAW MEAT

12:04.491 --> 12:07.094
WHICH HIS UNCLE
HAD CAUGHT, KILLED,
AND SENT HIM IN THE MAIL.

12:07.194 --> 12:10.097
SO MY OPTIONS WERE
TO EAT THAT OR TO GO
OUT AND GET SOME FOOD,

12:10.197 --> 12:12.565
AND I WAS SURE THAT IF
I WENT OUT, CAME BACK,

12:12.665 --> 12:15.735
HE WOULDN'T ANSWER
THE BUZZER OR HE WOULD
HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.637
SO HE COOKED IT,
I ATE IT.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.408
AND I SWEAR TO YOU, I FELT
MYSELF GROWING STRONGER
WITH EVERY BITE.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.111
YEAH, IT'S PROTEIN.
YOUR BODY NEEDED PROTEIN.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.713
IT WAS LIKE THE ROSES
CAME BACK TO MY CHEEKS.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.081
- SERIOUSLY.
- ( laughs )

12:28.181 --> 12:29.917
AND I HAD THIS REVELATION,
WHICH WAS LIKE,

12:30.017 --> 12:33.186
"I SHOULD BE EATING MEAT.
I SHOULD NOT BE DATING
THIS PERSON."

12:33.286 --> 12:35.455
- SO YOU STOPPED?
- NO, I DID NOT STOP.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.357
THAT WOULD BE TOO LOGICAL.
( laughs )

12:37.457 --> 12:38.959
I KEPT DOING IT FOR,
LIKE, SIX MORE WEEKS

12:39.059 --> 12:40.493
BECAUSE I'M A SLOW LEARNER.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.562
( laughs )

12:42.662 --> 12:44.197
GOOD TO HEAR.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.467
- THIS IS GREAT.
- YEAH, JIMMY DOES IT WELL.

12:47.567 --> 12:53.106
* And I'll be your
crying shoulder... *

12:53.206 --> 12:54.707
IS THIS PLACE ALWAYS
OPEN AT NIGHT?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.343
I THINK MY FRIEND
JOHN MIGHT BE HERE.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.078
COOL.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.512
OKAY, I'M GONNA GET A DRINK.
YOU WANT SOMETHING?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.714
UM, WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?

13:01.815 --> 13:04.384
- A BEER. YOU WANT A BEER?
- PERFECT.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.986
GREAT.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.421
* The greatest man
of your *

13:08.521 --> 13:13.326
* I'll be your
crying shoulder... *

13:13.426 --> 13:17.097
ARE YOU GUYS READY
TO MAKE SOME NOISE?

13:17.197 --> 13:18.966
- ( applause )
- YEAH.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.533
SO PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER

13:20.633 --> 13:23.937
FOR THE GIRL WHO PUTS THE
MOTION IN THE OCEAN

13:24.037 --> 13:26.639
IN A SPECIAL NUMBER THEY
CREATED TO CELEBRATE THE LIFE

13:26.739 --> 13:29.209
- OF KERI LAWRENCE.
- Crowd: AW.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.144
PLEASE WELCOME

13:31.244 --> 13:34.447
HEATHER TRAVIS

13:34.547 --> 13:36.316

13:40.187 --> 13:42.555
- Man: ALL RIGHT!
- ( whistling )

13:44.691 --> 13:46.626
( music playing )

13:46.726 --> 13:49.229
* UH, UH, UH, UH, AH

13:49.329 --> 13:52.632
* UH, UH, I CAN DO

13:52.732 --> 13:55.768
* ROCK, ROCK TO

13:58.205 --> 14:01.641

14:01.741 --> 14:04.044

14:19.259 --> 14:21.995

14:34.374 --> 14:37.210

14:37.310 --> 14:40.180

14:55.495 --> 14:57.330
( music playing )

15:05.438 --> 15:07.474
YOU OKAY?

15:07.574 --> 15:10.810
YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS,
LIKE, REALLY DELUSIONAL?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.179
- WHAT WAS?
- THAT DANCING.

15:12.279 --> 15:16.116
( laughs )
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.485
OKAY, MAYBE IT WASN'T BAD
IN AMATEUR TERMS,

15:18.585 --> 15:21.721
BUT HEATHER IS MOVING
TO CALIFORNIA TO BE
A PROFESSIONAL DANCER.

15:21.821 --> 15:25.125
SO THAT SHOULD
JUST MAKE US ALL FEEL
PRETTY SAD AND WEIRD.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.859
I GUESS IT WAS
A LITTLE CHEESY.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.861
IT WAS, LIKE,
VERY CHEESY.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.964
- ( laughs )
- AND NOBODY'S TELLING HER.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.199
SHE'S GONNA TO GO TO L.A.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.766
AND LIVE IN SOME
SHITTY APARTMENT

15:33.866 --> 15:37.637
AND FEEL SCARED
AND SAD AND LONELY
AND WEIRD ALL THE TIME.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.206
BUT SHE'S GOT
A GOOD LIFE HERE.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.907
- I WOULD LIKE HER LIFE.
- ( laughs )

15:41.008 --> 15:42.609
MAYBE I SHOULD MOVE HERE.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.277
SO THEN I WOULDN'T
BE WORRYING ABOUT
RENT EVERY SECOND

15:44.377 --> 15:46.413
AND I CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS
ON MY BOOK FOR A MINUTE.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.749
THERE'S A JOB OPENING AT
THE FLORIST'S, I KNOW THAT.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.419
WELL, NO, I WOULD,
LIKE, GET A REAL JOB, LIKE
BE A TEACHER OR SOMETHING.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.454
- WHAT'S YOUR REAL JOB
IN NEW YORK?
- I'M A WRITER.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.723
- AND THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE MONEY?
- NO, I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.395
( sighs )

16:05.898 --> 16:08.301
SORRY.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.272
GOSH, YOU'RE SO SERIOUS.
( laughs )

16:13.406 --> 16:16.643
( laughs )
JUST DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:17.777 --> 16:21.014
- OKAY.
- LET'S HAVE FUN.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.249
DO YOU WANNA GO BACK
TO MY PLACE?

16:22.349 --> 16:25.152
- YEAH, TOTALLY.
- OKAY.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.422
( imitating Woody Allen )
A RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE A SHARK,

16:29.522 --> 16:31.291
YOU KNOW, IT HAS
TO KEEP MOVING...

16:31.391 --> 16:33.426
- ( laughs )
- OR IT DIES.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.628
AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS-- IS A DEAD SHARK.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.164
( laughs )

16:37.264 --> 16:38.765
THAT'S FROM
"ON THE WATERFRONT."

16:38.865 --> 16:42.035
- ( laughs )
- OBSCURE.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.504
WELL, I HOPE
SHE'S HAVING FUN.

16:44.604 --> 16:48.108
( chuckles )
I THINK SHE KNOWS
HOW TO HAVE FUN.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.642
SHE'S SUCH
AN ANXIOUS PERSON.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.044
I WISH I COULD
UNBURDEN HER.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.280
YOU KNOW,
BUT SHE'S LIKE ME.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.915
SHE HAS TO JITTER HER
WAY THROUGH HER 20s.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.350
YEAH, YOU WERE
SUCH A SPAZ

16:57.450 --> 16:59.052
- IN YOUR 20s.
- OH, "SPAZ"?

16:59.152 --> 17:01.454
( chuckles )

17:01.554 --> 17:04.124
I WORRY ALL THE TIME
ABOUT HER.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.626
THAT NEVER CHANGES.
ONCE THEY'RE BORN,

17:06.726 --> 17:08.095
YOU NEVER DON'T WORRY.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.997
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WITHOUT
CHILDREN LIVE LONGER.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.233
( chuckles )
NO, I REALLY WORRY.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.234
WHAT DOES A PERSON
LIKE THAT TURN INTO?

17:15.335 --> 17:16.836
A PERSON LIKE WHAT?

17:16.935 --> 17:19.306
SHE'S FUNNY, SURE.
LIKABLE, VERY LIKABLE.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.108
- BUT THAT AND 10¢.
- TAD, TAD.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.576
BUT AT WHAT POINT
WILL SHE REALIZE

17:23.675 --> 17:26.313
SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET
TO BE WHAT SHE WANTS TO BE

17:26.413 --> 17:28.248
- WHEN SHE GROWS UP?
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

17:28.348 --> 17:29.582
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO FORCED US

17:29.682 --> 17:31.551
TO CUT HER OFF TO HELP
HER REALIZE THAT.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.287
NO, I CUT HER OFF
SO SHE'D HAVE SOMETHING
TO WRITE ABOUT.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.023
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
HER WRITING IS ANY GOOD.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.992
WHAT IF SHE WAKES UP
AND SHE'S 30 AND,

17:40.093 --> 17:41.994
OH, WHAT DOES SHE
KNOW HOW TO DO?

17:42.095 --> 17:43.463
SHE KNOWS HOW TO HAVE FUN.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.766
SHE DOES WHAT SHE WANTS
WHEN SHE WANTS TO DO IT

17:46.866 --> 17:48.435
AND SHE HAS FUN.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.738
AND SHE THINKS ABOUT THAT FUN
AND SHE LEARNS FROM THAT FUN.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.507
HOW DID SHE GET THAT WAY?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.777
USE YOUR BRAIN.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.447
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.484
USE YOUR BRAIN.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.258
- OH, I CAN'T GET MY...
- ( chuckles )

18:12.625 --> 18:14.861
LIGHTS OFF.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.231
YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE MY BOOTS ON?

18:18.331 --> 18:20.066
UM, IT'S UP TO YOU.

18:20.167 --> 18:23.536
SEEMS TO ME YOU'D WANT
TO PUT YOUR FEET UP
ON THE BED, THOUGH.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.673
OKAY.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.215
WE DON'T HAVE
TO HAVE SEX.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.184
- WELL, DO YOU
WANT TO HAVE SEX?
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.819
I JUST-- I DON'T
WANT TO PRESSURE YOU.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.389
NO, I LIKE PRESSURE.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.392
( gasps )

18:56.769 --> 18:58.571
SORRY.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.680
- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART?
- OF WHAT?

19:07.780 --> 19:09.616
OF FUCKING ME?

19:09.716 --> 19:12.919
( laughs ) DON'T KNOW,
I HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.

19:18.891 --> 19:22.662
- OW.
- SORRY.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.369
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:29.469 --> 19:30.670
UM...

19:30.770 --> 19:33.406
PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR
FINGER IN MY ASSHOLE.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.308
YOU WEREN'T TELLING ME WHAT
IT WAS THAT YOU WANTED AT ALL,

19:35.408 --> 19:36.709
SO I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GUESS WHAT YOU WANTED.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.778
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO JUST TELL
ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.947
I JUST WANT TO HAVE SEX.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.182
OKAY.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.904
( breathing heavily )

20:13.546 --> 20:15.114
I'M TIGHT,
LIKE A BABY, RIGHT?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.617
COME ON, THAT'S...

20:17.717 --> 20:18.851
FUCK.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.053
- Loreen: OH!
- Tad: FUCK, THAT FEELS GOOD.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.323
- ( both laughing )
- WET AND WILD.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.792
YOU ARE SO EMBARRASSING.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.226
( laughs )

20:27.327 --> 20:28.661
- TURN AROUND.
- NOW?

20:28.761 --> 20:31.163
- RIGHT NOW, TURN AROUND.
- ( laughs )

20:31.264 --> 20:32.732
- ( grunts )
- OH, MY GOD.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.701
- AHH!
- OH, MY GOD!

20:34.801 --> 20:37.036
AH! AH!

20:37.136 --> 20:38.905
LET ME GET A LEG UP.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.408
- OH!
- ( thuds )

20:41.508 --> 20:44.010
( giggles )
HONEY?

20:44.110 --> 20:45.645
TAD?!

20:47.146 --> 20:49.081
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.383
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.651
- AND FOR THE RIDE.
- YEAH.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.153
- I WILL SEE YOU SOON.
- OKAY.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.523
( kisses )

20:58.224 --> 21:01.093
- GET HOME SAFELY.
- OKAY.

21:01.193 --> 21:04.497
BYE. BYE.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.406
Loreen:
TAD? OH, MY GOD.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.975
HONEY? SWEETIE,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:16.075 --> 21:17.710
TAD? BABY?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.546
- OH, MY GOD.
- CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.047
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:21.147 --> 21:22.449
HE SLIPPED AND HIT
HIS HEAD.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.584
HE'S OUT.
HE IS CONCUSSED.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.052
WELL, WHAT WAS HE DOING?
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

21:26.152 --> 21:28.921
WE WERE HAVING SEX.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.256
OKAY, DAD?

21:30.357 --> 21:32.392
DAD? DADDY?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.093
- DADDY?
- OH.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.528
OKAY, MOM.
HE'S NOT PASSED OUT.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.330
NOT PASSED OUT.
HE'S NOT PASSED OUT.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.566
- I THINK I TORE MY BACK.
- YOUR BACK?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.668
MY HEAD IS NOTHING
COMPARED TO MY BACK.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.103
- OH, MY GOD.
- SHIT, I FEEL AWFUL.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.438
I THINK WE SHOULD,
LIKE, PUT HIM IN A ROBE

21:45.538 --> 21:47.340
OR COVER HIM AND JUST
GET HIM INTO BED.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.241
YOU CAN GO TO YOUR ROOM.
I CAN GET THIS.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.444
NO, MOM.
I CAN HELP YOU, OKAY?

21:51.544 --> 21:53.279
SO JUST GRAB HIS ARM,
GRAB HIS ARM.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.482
WE'RE GONNA GET HIM UP.
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.450
- OH, MY GOD.
- AND JUST HOLD
ONTO THE TOWEL.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.420
- OR DON'T HOLD ONTO THE TOWEL.
- OH! I'M EMBARRASSED!

22:00.520 --> 22:02.221
OF COURSE
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED

22:02.321 --> 22:05.191
BECAUSE THIS IS
HORRIBLY EMBARRASSING
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.359
OKAY.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.428
THAT IS FULLY
YOUR WET BUTT.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.697
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
OKAY, MOM, SO YOU CAN JUST--

22:10.797 --> 22:13.199
Hannah:
JUST GIVE A SHOUT IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING, OKAY, DADDY?

22:13.299 --> 22:15.134
I'M FINE,

22:15.234 --> 22:16.903
JUST REALIZING
I'M GROWING OLDER.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.406
NO, NO.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.076
OKAY, NOW I GET
WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT SEX.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.713
( laughs )
OH, PLEASE.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.981
- HOW WAS YOUR DATE?
- IT WAS GOOD.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.384
HE'S REALLY NICE.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.052
WELL, HE SEEMS IT.

22:33.152 --> 22:36.155
MAYBE NOT ENOUGH FIRE BURNING
UNDER HIS ASS FOR YOUR TASTE,

22:36.255 --> 22:38.090
BUT HE'LL DO FOR THE DAY?

22:38.190 --> 22:41.093
YEAH, HE'LL DO FOR THE DAY.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.332
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO
TO SLEEP BECAUSE THAT
IS AN EARLY FLIGHT.

22:46.433 --> 22:50.269
IS EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH YOU MONEYWISE?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.038
I MEAN, REALLY OKAY?

22:52.138 --> 22:54.807
BECAUSE THAT WAS
A HARD BLOW WE DEALT YOU,
CUTTING YOU OFF.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.544
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE
IF YOU WEREN'T ALL
THE WAY ON YOUR FEET.

22:57.644 --> 23:00.747
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU
FOR MAKING IT WORK.

23:02.148 --> 23:05.652
I ONLY MENTION JOBS AROUND
HERE BECAUSE I MISS YOU.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.288
NO, I'M GOOD.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.223
I'M MAKING IT WORK.

23:11.323 --> 23:14.794
THAT IS MY SCRAPPY
LITTLE GIRL.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.664
( both chuckling )

23:19.031 --> 23:22.034
- LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU, TOO, SWEETIE.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.503
SLEEP WELL.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.137
YOU, TOO.
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.774
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.850
( cell phone chiming )

23:46.258 --> 23:48.194
- HELLO?
- Adam: Yo, kid.

23:48.294 --> 23:51.731
OH, HI.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.733
- IT'S HANNAH.
- I KNOW, I CALLED YOU.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.735
OH, YEAH.
I WAS SLEEPING.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.837
YEAH, YOU SOUND SLEEPY.
I'M SORRY, KID.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.773
OH, NO. IT'S OKAY.
I'M ACTUALLY-- I'M HOME.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.309
YEAH, I'M HOME, TOO.

24:03.409 --> 24:04.511
YEAH, BUT I'M LIKE
HOME, HOME,

24:04.611 --> 24:06.112
LIKE, AT MY PARENTS'
HOME, HOME.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.881
LIKE, LOOKING AT
A GOO GOO DOLLS' POSTER
AS WE SPEAK.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.216
( laughs )

24:10.316 --> 24:11.951
WELL, HOW ARE THINGS
IN OHIO?

24:12.051 --> 24:14.120
I'M IN MICHIGAN,

24:14.220 --> 24:16.255
SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW
HOW THINGS ARE IN OHIO.

24:16.355 --> 24:17.757
OH, SHIT, FUCK.
SORRY-- MICHIGAN.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.526
( laughs )
NO, IT'S FINE.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.793
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN CARE
IF PEOPLE GET MY NAME WRONG.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.329
ARE YOU JUST CALLING
TO SAY HI?

24:23.429 --> 24:26.499
YEAH. DID YOU
CALL ME EARLIER?

24:26.599 --> 24:29.335
- DID I?
- A FEW TIMES, YEAH.

24:29.435 --> 24:32.839
- Everything okay?
- OH, UM...

24:32.939 --> 24:35.808
YEAH, THINGS HERE ARE GOOD.
THEY'RE INTERESTING.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.477
I JUST HELPED MY DAD
AFTER A SEX INJURY,

24:38.578 --> 24:40.980
SO, THAT HAPPENED.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.949
YOU'RE HAVING SEX
WITH YOUR FATHER?

24:43.049 --> 24:45.284
UH, NO, I WASN'T HAVING
SEX WITH MY FATHER.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.919
HE WAS HAVING SEX
WITH MY MOTHER.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.121
OH, THAT SEEMS
LIKE A BETTER MATCH.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.324
I WAS ACTUALLY--
I WAS OUT HAVING SEX
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

24:52.424 --> 24:54.594
I WAS HAVING SEX
WITH A PHARMACIST.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.763
Oh, yeah?
Was it fun?

24:56.863 --> 24:58.865
UH, FUN?

24:58.965 --> 25:01.267
SURE. I MEAN,
PHYSICALLY, YES.

25:01.367 --> 25:03.603
YES, IT WAS.
BUT...

25:03.703 --> 25:06.138
WAS THAT A VERY WEIRD THING
FOR ME TO JUST TELL YOU?

25:06.238 --> 25:07.740
WHY WOULD THAT BE WEIRD?

25:07.840 --> 25:10.543
I MEAN, HONESTLY, I WAS JUST
SO AMAZED BY HIS APARTMENT.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.478
IT'S HUGE. IT'S LIKE TWICE
THE SIZE OF YOURS,

25:12.579 --> 25:14.547
AND HE PAID
NOTHING FOR IT.

25:14.647 --> 25:17.584
AND IT JUST MADE ME
THINK, "WHY DOESN'T EVERYONE
WHO'S STRUGGLING IN NEW YORK

25:17.684 --> 25:19.451
MOVE HERE AND START
THE REVOLUTION?"

25:19.552 --> 25:20.987
IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALL
SLAVES TO THIS PLACE

25:21.087 --> 25:24.290
THAT DOESN'T EVEN REALLY
WANT US. YOU KNOW?

25:25.357 --> 25:26.826
I DID CALL YOU

25:26.926 --> 25:29.461
BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU HADN'T DISAPPEARED.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.230
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.965
I realized today that
if something happened
to one of us,

25:33.065 --> 25:34.601
THE OTHER ONE WON'T HAVE
NO WAY OF EVER KNOWING

25:34.701 --> 25:36.468
'CAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR
FRIENDS WOULD CALL ME.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.605
IT'S NOT LIKE I KNOW
YOUR MOM, SO, YOU KNOW,

25:38.705 --> 25:41.574
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO YOU, I WOULD NEVER
KNOW YOU WERE GONE.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.943
SO I GUESS I WAS JUST
CALLING TO MAKE SURE

25:44.043 --> 25:46.846
THAT YOU WOULD CALL ME
IF YOU EVER DISAPPEARED.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.781
WHICH DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE SENSE.

25:48.881 --> 25:52.351
UH, OKAY, KID,
WILL DO.

25:52.451 --> 25:54.687
- I MISS YOU.
- YOU DO?

25:54.787 --> 25:56.856
I do, yeah.
I wish you were here
right now.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.557
I SAW YOUR NAME EARLIER
ON THE PHONE

25:58.658 --> 26:00.292
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT GIRL?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.328
I WISH SHE WAS
HERE RIGHT NOW."

26:04.463 --> 26:06.666
WELL, I'M IN
MICHIGAN, SO...

26:06.766 --> 26:09.802
What do you see out your window
in New York right now?

26:11.170 --> 26:13.105
( groans )
YOU WANT ME TO GET
UP AND LOOK?

26:13.205 --> 26:14.406
I DO, YEAH.

26:14.506 --> 26:17.877
- Get up and look.
- ( groans )

26:21.313 --> 26:24.917
- OKAY, WHAT DO I SEE?
- ( siren blaring )

26:25.017 --> 26:26.452
OH! OH!

26:26.552 --> 26:28.454
There's this
lady crackhead.

26:28.554 --> 26:29.956
I've talked to her,
like, twice.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.591
She's pretty
fucking tweaked,

26:32.692 --> 26:34.661
but, I don't know, funny.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.462
One time
we had a conversation
about cashews

26:36.562 --> 26:37.764
that lasted, like,
30 minutes.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.531
She, like,
wanted cashews,

26:39.632 --> 26:41.267
and she thought
I had them,

26:41.367 --> 26:43.135
but I didn't,
so she was trying
to grab my ass,

26:43.235 --> 26:45.237
saying I had them
in my back pocket.

26:45.337 --> 26:46.572
I'm like,
"No, I don't have them
in my back pocket..."

26:46.673 --> 26:51.978
* SO NOW I AM OLDER

26:52.078 --> 26:56.082
* THAN MY MOTHER
AND FATHER *

26:56.182 --> 27:00.152
* WHEN THEY HAD
THEIR DAUGHTER *

27:00.252 --> 27:05.658
* NOW, WHAT DOES
THAT SAY ABOUT ME? *

27:07.193 --> 27:12.999
* OH, HOW COULD
I DREAM OF *

27:13.099 --> 27:17.536
* SUCH A SELFLESS
AND TRUE LOVE? *

27:17.636 --> 27:21.941
* COULD I WASH
MY HANDS OF *

27:22.041 --> 27:26.278
* JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR ME? *

27:29.015 --> 27:31.417
* OH, MAN,
WHAT I USED TO BE *

27:31.517 --> 27:36.022
* OH, MAN, OH, MY,
OH, ME *

27:38.490 --> 27:44.030
* IN DEARTH OR IN EXCESS

27:44.130 --> 27:48.667
* BOTH THE SLAVE
AND THE EMPRESS *

27:48.768 --> 27:53.572
* WILL RETURN TO THE DIRT,
I GUESS *

27:53.672 --> 27:58.410
* NAKED AS WHEN THEY CAME

27:58.510 --> 28:03.415
* OH, OH, OH

28:05.117 --> 28:08.988
* OH, MAN,
WHAT I USED TO BE *

28:11.057 --> 28:13.659
* MONTEZUMA TO TRIPOLI

28:13.760 --> 28:18.865
* OH, MAN, OH, MY,
OH, ME. *
