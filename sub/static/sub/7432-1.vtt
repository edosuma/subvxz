00:42.075 --> 00:45.306
20-29! Go!

01:00.559 --> 01:03.119
All right. You take the inside.

01:04.229 --> 01:07.129
On this one,
you take the inside. 54...

01:07.298 --> 01:08.993
Ready, set...

01:09.200 --> 01:10.667
2-85!

01:14.705 --> 01:20.041
Back! Throw! Throw the ball!
Touchdown, Joe.

01:22.179 --> 01:26.172
- What?
- Pendleton. He's looking awful good.

01:28.251 --> 01:31.015
Fall into it.
All right. Come on, baby.

01:31.154 --> 01:36.023
Set... Good movement.
Let's try it again.

01:46.235 --> 01:48.203
1-83!

01:54.275 --> 01:57.176
- He's looking awful good.
- Here we go!

02:04.686 --> 02:07.382
Hustle back, hustle back.
Come on, guys. Come on.

02:11.625 --> 02:17.291
Opposite left, play past 35.
X-curl on 1. Ready? Break.

02:20.134 --> 02:22.102
4-3, set!

02:22.302 --> 02:26.738
- Play past 29...
- 2-81!

02:28.674 --> 02:33.270
Pass! Pass! Pass!
Ball! Ball! Ball!

02:34.380 --> 02:36.348
Once again, we had a foul-up
on that scrimmage.

02:36.549 --> 02:39.985
The fullback has been
slow getting up for his block.

02:40.119 --> 02:43.713
The guard almost ran into him.
We got to do it till it's right.

02:44.422 --> 02:48.017
Formation left.
Screen right on 2. Ready?

02:51.029 --> 02:53.190
Right, left! Right, left!

02:54.032 --> 02:58.661
4-3... Set! 2-85!

03:07.444 --> 03:09.639
Looking awful good.

03:12.049 --> 03:14.516
I'm thinking of starting him
on Sunday.

03:17.153 --> 03:20.054
- What about Jarrett?
- Pendleton's looking better.

03:20.223 --> 03:21.656
2-81!

03:23.693 --> 03:25.957
Pass! Pass! Pass!

03:27.030 --> 03:28.998
Ball! Ball! Ball!

03:29.164 --> 03:31.189
- Is he still on cortisone?
- No.

03:31.366 --> 03:33.231
Any kind of painkiller?

03:33.402 --> 03:37.133
- Nothing.
- He's looking awful good.

03:45.546 --> 03:49.607
I never saw a knee like that
heal without surgery.

03:49.784 --> 03:52.412
- He's looking awful good.
- Looking good.

03:54.488 --> 03:57.753
- Hi, Joe. How's the knee?
- Good.

03:58.092 --> 04:00.219
What do you think
of the Rams' chances?

04:00.394 --> 04:02.418
We're going to the Super Bowl to win.

04:02.629 --> 04:06.963
- No, off the record.
- Off the record?

04:07.167 --> 04:09.032
We're going to the Super Bowl to win.

04:09.202 --> 04:12.501
- Sure. What about your competition?
- Competition?

04:12.706 --> 04:16.642
- Jarrett.
- My competition's 25 other teams.

04:47.672 --> 04:50.538
- Max?
- Yeah!

04:50.707 --> 04:54.006
- How you doing?
- What's in this brown stuff?

04:54.177 --> 04:57.977
- That's mainly whipped liver.
- Liver?

04:58.148 --> 05:01.311
I put a little whey in it, then mix it
with a little alfalfa sprouts,

05:01.485 --> 05:05.580
and some bean curd and spinach.

05:05.988 --> 05:10.288
It's nice, isn't it?
It's a liver and whey shake.

05:11.327 --> 05:15.593
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

05:15.965 --> 05:21.493
Happy birthday, dear Joe
Happy birthday to you

05:21.670 --> 05:24.571
I didn't think anybody knew.
Thanks for coming, Max.

05:24.739 --> 05:27.537
- Put it here.
- I hope you have a lot more.

05:32.314 --> 05:34.145
What's this?

05:41.422 --> 05:45.358
You know something? At my age,
in any other business, I'd be young.

05:45.559 --> 05:47.117
Look at it this way...

05:47.294 --> 05:51.492
Soon you can get into another
business and have a real life.

05:54.701 --> 05:56.396
I don't know what that means.

05:56.569 --> 06:00.164
This is the only business I know
that's real. I'm stuck.

06:00.340 --> 06:01.898
What do you mean, stuck?

06:02.075 --> 06:07.411
I've been working my whole life
to get a chance to do something...

06:08.613 --> 06:12.913
I don't know if I'm ever going
to get a chance to do it.

06:14.353 --> 06:17.322
- No, it's all right.
- I'll fix your neck.

06:17.522 --> 06:19.922
- Don't do that, Joe.
- Wait a minute.

06:21.693 --> 06:24.183
- How's that?
- Oh, boy. Yeah.

06:24.395 --> 06:26.989
It scares the hell out of me
every time you do that.

06:27.164 --> 06:31.464
If you don't watch how your trapezius
goes into your deltoids,

06:31.635 --> 06:36.038
you're going to throw off your entire
cervical and your lumbar areas.

06:36.207 --> 06:38.471
Since I'm the only guy
knows how to fix that,

06:38.676 --> 06:42.941
- you should listen to me.
- Maybe you should trade places.

06:43.079 --> 06:44.603
You be the trainer.
I'll start on Sunday.

06:44.981 --> 06:46.573
Yeah... what?

06:50.253 --> 06:52.118
- I'm starting against Dallas?
- Yeah.

06:52.589 --> 06:55.217
They don't want Jarrett.
They want you.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.357
Happy birthday, Joe.

09:07.081 --> 09:10.448
My watch stopped.
It keeps flashing the same time.

09:11.352 --> 09:13.252
I'm dreaming, huh?

09:25.365 --> 09:27.458
This is an aeroplane dream.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.501
I forget what they mean.
I think they're a good sign.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.404
Mr Pendleton.

09:36.575 --> 09:40.671
Mr Pendleton, you must wait for me.
I'm your escort.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.683
Wait for me, please, Mr Pendleton.

09:50.355 --> 09:53.016
The end of the line,
Mr Pendleton, please.

09:53.224 --> 09:56.318
Hi. How you doing?
You want to hear a little music?

09:56.527 --> 10:00.691
- You have to wait in line.
- What? This is my dream, isn't it?

10:01.032 --> 10:03.262
You mustn't get out of line. Really!

10:04.135 --> 10:07.695
- Chamberlain, Paul R.
- All right.

10:08.038 --> 10:11.405
I've brought the final passenger.
This manifest is complete.

10:11.575 --> 10:14.976
- Hi.
- You cannot board before your turn.

10:15.178 --> 10:17.112
I don't need a turn.
I'm not boarding.

10:17.280 --> 10:21.341
You don't understand.
This is not your ultimate destination.

10:21.551 --> 10:23.518
That will take you to it.

10:23.719 --> 10:27.553
I'm not going. I'm going to run
around till I wake up.

10:27.723 --> 10:32.717
I'm afraid I haven't fully explained
how this system is organised.

10:33.062 --> 10:35.155
The rules derive from yours,

10:35.331 --> 10:38.357
a product of your image and that
of those who share your image.

10:38.534 --> 10:41.991
If you violate the rules, the principles...

10:42.203 --> 10:43.602
You want to see a trick?

10:43.771 --> 10:46.672
I do this to keep
my abductor pollicis limber.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.407
I don't have a lot of patter with it.

10:49.577 --> 10:52.671
Feel that. That's a 50-cent piece.

10:53.014 --> 10:55.641
I just throw that
into that hand, you see.

10:56.016 --> 11:01.147
I say the magic words, "Abracadabra",
and then presto, it's gone.

11:01.321 --> 11:05.087
Now, you probably think
I still have it.

11:06.093 --> 11:09.221
You're wrong, 'cause I can see it
coming out of your ear.

11:09.429 --> 11:10.588
The only trick I know.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.434
- Mr Pendleton!
- Gentlemen?

11:17.970 --> 11:20.564
Gentlemen, what's the delay?

11:20.740 --> 11:24.198
We've received a new arrival
who refuses to board.

11:24.410 --> 11:27.003
That's impossible. Have you
explained the rules to him?

11:27.212 --> 11:28.975
- Yes, sir.
- Quite clearly?

11:29.147 --> 11:31.707
- Yes, sir.
- And what was his rebuttal?

11:33.251 --> 11:35.947
He took a coin out of my ear.

11:36.121 --> 11:39.056
Did he? Perhaps I should
have a word with him.

11:39.758 --> 11:42.590
Yes, sir. Mr Pendleton!

11:44.294 --> 11:46.660
He's right over there, sir.

11:47.031 --> 11:51.127
- Mr Pendleton!
- Yeah. You can call me Joe.

11:51.301 --> 11:52.996
How you doing?

11:53.137 --> 11:55.401
Mr Pendleton,
do you know where you are?

11:55.606 --> 11:58.233
I'm in the middle
of a really weird dream.

11:58.441 --> 12:01.274
- You see the problem?
- Joe, come here.

12:13.489 --> 12:17.948
Look at me and listen carefully
to what I'm saying.

12:18.994 --> 12:22.259
- This is not a dream.
- Yeah.

12:22.431 --> 12:25.992
Life has a certain quality
all its own, a certain feeling.

12:26.201 --> 12:30.694
So do dreams.
You know that this is not life.

12:31.038 --> 12:34.030
And you know now
that this is not a dream.

12:34.241 --> 12:39.201
This is a place that comes
after life and after dreams.

12:39.413 --> 12:44.350
I'm sure you're aware of that, and
you'll take your place with the others.

12:49.656 --> 12:51.988
Are you telling me...?

13:08.707 --> 13:12.006
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- But you are here.

13:12.177 --> 13:13.940
You guys made a mistake.

13:14.146 --> 13:17.240
This is insupportable.
You're talking to Mr Jordan.

13:17.416 --> 13:21.283
- Anybody can make a mistake.
- Mr Jordan, we're due to take off.

13:21.452 --> 13:27.015
I have the situation in hand.
Joe, if you don't take your place,

13:27.225 --> 13:29.955
the others can't complete
their journey. Is that fair?

13:30.128 --> 13:35.064
I'm not supposed to be fair, you are.
I didn't make any mistake.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.963
This is not heaven,
it's a way station. There's no mistake.

13:39.136 --> 13:41.161
I want a check-out
on Joseph Pendleton.

13:41.338 --> 13:44.967
When is he due at this way station?

13:45.709 --> 13:49.644
Sir, I don't understand.
A check-out? Why?

13:50.012 --> 13:52.071
The likelihood
of one individual being right

13:52.248 --> 13:56.514
increases in proportion to how much
others try to prove him wrong.

13:57.720 --> 14:03.590
Pendleton, Joseph. Due to arrive
10.17 am, March 20th, 2025.

14:05.927 --> 14:08.418
Sir, I really can't believe it.

14:08.596 --> 14:12.532
I took him out...
just before the accident.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.895
You did what?!

14:15.036 --> 14:18.597
You're not supposed to do that,
you must wait for the outcome.

14:18.973 --> 14:22.931
But I was so sure, and it looked
like it would be painful.

14:23.076 --> 14:26.637
- Wait. Are you saying...?
- Is this your first assignment?

14:27.014 --> 14:30.177
- Yes, sir.
- Haven't you learned the rules?

14:30.384 --> 14:34.946
Every question of life and death
is a probability until the outcome.

14:35.088 --> 14:37.022
So he jumped the gun.

14:37.191 --> 14:41.320
Just put me back
and we'll forget the whole thing.

14:41.494 --> 14:45.487
This man must be put back
into his body at once.

14:47.500 --> 14:52.028
Thanks, Mr Jordan.
I'll see you in about 50 years.

15:04.049 --> 15:08.349
- Max, I'm back.
- He can't hear you, Mr Pendleton.

15:08.553 --> 15:14.957
I hope they got the best football
team in America in heaven,

15:15.125 --> 15:17.093
and I hope God makes you
first-string.

15:18.996 --> 15:23.330
I'm going to get my body back.
Where's my body?

15:27.036 --> 15:30.130
- Oh, dear.
- Cremated. I see.

15:30.340 --> 15:33.036
I'm starting against Dallas
on Sunday.

15:33.243 --> 15:36.007
The body you occupied
on Earth has been cremated.

15:36.179 --> 15:39.307
Uncremate me! You must be able
to do something right.

15:39.482 --> 15:44.214
Do the words "not being a good sport"
mean anything to you?

15:44.386 --> 15:47.412
We can put you
into another man's body,

15:47.623 --> 15:49.614
provided his death
has not yet been discovered.

15:49.992 --> 15:53.393
Are you kidding? Put me
into the body of another man?

15:53.562 --> 15:55.393
I just got my body back in shape.

15:57.365 --> 16:01.165
The only way you can return
to life is in the body of another man.

16:03.137 --> 16:06.072
I shall have to take charge
of this case personally.

16:08.209 --> 16:12.373
Incredibly graceful. He's about
your age and in perfect condition.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.514
He's too short.
He'd never see over the line.

16:19.319 --> 16:23.085
You know what kind of shape you gotta
be in to get to the Super Bowl?

16:23.256 --> 16:26.089
Yes, Joe. I understand.

16:30.329 --> 16:34.288
- He's not talking English.
- I told you he was German.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.903
- Hey, you talk any English?
- We can't be seen or heard, Joe.

16:39.038 --> 16:41.233
Well, I don't want to talk German.

16:44.376 --> 16:46.900
I gotta call the plays in English.

16:47.045 --> 16:51.379
Joe, if you could not so much lower
but broaden your standards.

16:51.549 --> 16:55.918
We've seen many bodies
and the choices are becoming limited.

17:04.094 --> 17:07.621
- Julia, I beg of you...
- I want a drink.

17:07.964 --> 17:11.401
- Dearest, please!
- I've got to have a drink.

17:11.568 --> 17:15.367
Mr Farnsworth loathes
cold cucumber soup.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.407
Hey, this is some house.
Who lives here?

17:19.608 --> 17:23.339
Leo Farnsworth,
a man of enormous power.

17:26.549 --> 17:28.949
Thank you, Sisk.

17:29.118 --> 17:33.076
Just leave the door open
as you leave, Sisk. Thank you.

17:34.389 --> 17:35.879
The more servants who see us,
the better.

17:36.057 --> 17:39.584
- This guy? You're kidding!
- That's not Farnsworth.

17:39.928 --> 17:40.952
Give me a drink.

17:41.663 --> 17:45.463
- Who are they?
- Farnsworth's wife and secretary.

17:45.633 --> 17:48.567
- You hate me.
- Don't be ridiculous. I love you.

17:48.936 --> 17:50.563
I want a drink now! Tony...

17:50.971 --> 17:53.405
It would be better
if you didn't drink.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.200
How long will it be
before they find him?

17:56.377 --> 17:59.073
I don't know, darling. Not long.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.510
- I'm glad we did it.
- We couldn't help it.

18:01.882 --> 18:07.251
It would be better if you'd try
not to unravel now. Thank you, Julia.

18:07.453 --> 18:10.479
- Is Farnsworth dead yet?
- Not yet.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.317
What's the matter with him?
He can't keep his eyes open.

18:14.494 --> 18:18.487
He's been drugged by those two
downstairs. This is a murder.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.962
You see how he's slowly
sliding into the water?

18:22.134 --> 18:24.068
Hey, somebody, get...!

18:28.240 --> 18:30.902
Hey, get a doctor. There's a guy...

18:31.076 --> 18:34.045
Get a doctor. You got a guy
drowning in the bathtub.

18:34.212 --> 18:37.977
- You left a pot on the carpet.
- I can't hold everything at once.

18:38.182 --> 18:41.276
Mrs Farnsworth would kill you
if she saw that.

18:42.119 --> 18:44.087
Hey, somebody! You got...

18:44.255 --> 18:47.554
- Give me a drink!
- Please don't go overboard, dear.

18:47.925 --> 18:50.894
He was a lecherous sadist.
Everyone wanted him dead.

18:51.028 --> 18:55.157
- I should be canonised!
- Perhaps one drink.

18:55.331 --> 18:57.561
- Where can the man be?
- I'm sorry, Miss Logan...

18:57.934 --> 19:00.095
What harm can that do him?

19:00.303 --> 19:02.863
- That's enough.
- He deserves to be dead.

19:03.039 --> 19:06.031
They didn't? No kidding?
They're murderers.

19:06.209 --> 19:07.540
What's going on?

19:07.876 --> 19:12.006
I'm sorry, sir. It's Miss Logan
to see Mr Farnsworth.

19:12.181 --> 19:14.877
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

19:16.251 --> 19:19.379
It's the perfect alibi.
She insists on seeing him.

19:19.588 --> 19:22.921
- Let's find another body.
- A servant will find him.

19:23.092 --> 19:26.959
Excuse yourself and keep Sisk
with you at all times...

19:27.128 --> 19:29.562
- Let's get out of here.
- Miss Logan, sir.

19:32.266 --> 19:34.996
Miss Logan. I'm Tony Abbott.

19:35.169 --> 19:39.003
This is the library.
That's Mrs Farnsworth.

19:39.207 --> 19:42.937
Hello. I'm going
into the living room.

19:43.110 --> 19:46.637
- Want to come, Sisk?
- Certainly, madam.

19:48.248 --> 19:51.445
I'm Mr Farnsworth's personal
and private executive secretary.

19:51.618 --> 19:57.055
I didn't know whether you knew that.
I'm sorry he's not down yet.

19:57.223 --> 19:59.123
That's all right. I'll wait.

19:59.291 --> 20:02.055
- Would you take a seat?
- No, thank you.

20:03.529 --> 20:06.555
Perhaps you'd like
to tell me what it's about.

20:07.933 --> 20:10.299
Mr Farnsworth has been sent
hundreds of letters

20:10.469 --> 20:12.368
from Pagglesham in England.

20:12.537 --> 20:15.938
The people who live there,
1,600, including my father,

20:16.107 --> 20:18.200
are to be evicted from their homes

20:18.409 --> 20:21.572
to make way for the proposed
Exo-Grey refinery.

20:21.980 --> 20:26.246
Hundreds of families
will be forced to find other homes.

20:26.417 --> 20:29.249
The few who remain
will have their health endangered

20:29.419 --> 20:32.252
by poisoning of their air and water,

20:32.422 --> 20:35.357
the evidence for which I have here,

20:35.526 --> 20:40.225
along with a petition signed
by the 1,673 citizens of that area.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.564
This is what I'm here about.

20:44.734 --> 20:48.135
Mr Farnsworth conducts business
at his office.

20:49.038 --> 20:52.269
I've been to his office.
He refused to see me.

20:52.408 --> 20:57.175
- I doubt he'd see you here.
- He'll have to, I'm not leaving.

20:59.581 --> 21:01.572
- I'm sorry?
- I'm not leaving.

21:01.950 --> 21:06.353
I've come 8,000 miles to do something
about a terrible injustice

21:06.521 --> 21:11.549
that this man has perpetrated
on hundreds of defenceless people.

21:11.927 --> 21:16.420
- Somebody ought to help her.
- You can. You can be Farnsworth.

21:16.597 --> 21:20.966
If Mr Farnsworth doesn't see me,
I don't know what I'll do.

21:21.135 --> 21:24.036
- Is that a threat?
- Yes.

21:24.205 --> 21:26.264
I'd like to help,
but not as Farnsworth.

21:26.473 --> 21:30.933
- The decision is yours.
- You give me no choice. Sisk!

21:31.444 --> 21:36.006
If I had to be Farnsworth,
could we do it temporary?

21:36.216 --> 21:39.913
Yes. We could arrange that
if you wish it.

21:40.086 --> 21:45.922
Sisk, please tell Mr Farnsworth
Miss Logan refuses to leave.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.250
Yes, sir.

21:47.459 --> 21:51.190
If you really want to help her,
you'd better hurry.

21:52.264 --> 21:55.529
- Well, it's only temporary, right?
- That's correct.

21:57.703 --> 21:59.671
Only Farnsworth can help her.

21:59.938 --> 22:02.270
Once the body's discovered,
it'll be too late.

22:14.452 --> 22:18.320
That's me. I haven't changed.

22:21.658 --> 22:25.116
- It's just me.
- Mr Farnsworth?

22:25.295 --> 22:28.093
- Now what do we do?
- Are you there, sir?

22:28.265 --> 22:31.200
I'll never get away with this.
What will we do now?

22:31.368 --> 22:33.336
Are you all right?

22:33.503 --> 22:36.300
- Answer him.
- People can hear me now?

22:36.472 --> 22:39.532
- Of course.
- But he knows the other guy's voice.

22:39.708 --> 22:42.233
Mr Farnsworth,
is everything all right?

22:42.411 --> 22:43.605
Answer him.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.911
Will you take it easy?
I'll be out in a minute.

22:50.085 --> 22:53.679
- Very good, sir.
- It works.

22:54.022 --> 22:57.082
Of course. You haven't changed.

22:57.258 --> 22:59.886
You're still Joe Pendleton.
That's what you and I see.

23:00.028 --> 23:04.158
But outwardly, you're Leo Farnsworth,
and that's what everyone else sees.

23:14.107 --> 23:15.631
Miss Logan is downstairs, sir.

23:16.009 --> 23:19.172
She insists on seeing you.
Will you dress?

23:19.346 --> 23:22.906
- Sure, sure.
- Very good, sir.

23:24.550 --> 23:27.314
You mean I sound like this guy,
no matter what I talk like?

23:27.486 --> 23:30.455
- I beg your pardon, Mr Farnsworth?
- You see?

23:51.543 --> 23:53.408
Julia, please, dear.

23:53.611 --> 23:56.670
- Please, dear, not now. Not now.
- I want a sip.

23:57.014 --> 24:00.415
You're sorry you have me, aren't you?
You wish he were alive.

24:00.617 --> 24:04.178
- Julia, please.
- Why don't you say it's not true?

24:06.123 --> 24:08.091
- You didn't say it's not true.
- It's not true.

24:08.292 --> 24:09.850
Say it again.

24:09.993 --> 24:13.291
Darling, it's not true.
I don't hate you. I love you.

24:15.531 --> 24:17.897
- There, sir.
- Thank you.

24:23.673 --> 24:26.937
Your helmet, sir.
Your polo helmet, sir.

24:27.109 --> 24:32.240
- Thanks. Do I play polo?
- Not really, sir.

24:32.414 --> 24:36.544
- Sir?
- Thank you.

24:36.918 --> 24:40.945
- This Logan girl is a godsend.
- What's taking so long?

24:41.156 --> 24:43.521
Pretend you're reading.

24:55.035 --> 25:00.062
- Miss Logan, sir.
- Hi. How you doing?

25:00.240 --> 25:04.233
I'm not leaving until you've heard
what I have to say.

25:05.078 --> 25:07.945
Oh, yeah. Well, good.

25:08.148 --> 25:12.175
Mr Farnsworth, you've been sent
hundreds of letters from Pagglesham.

25:12.352 --> 25:15.912
- I know about that.
- Have you read the letters?

25:18.090 --> 25:20.354
- Well, no.
- No. I suspected as much.

25:20.559 --> 25:26.623
That's why I've flown over here.
I and the 1,673 people I represent,

25:26.965 --> 25:28.899
whose names are on this petition,

25:29.067 --> 25:32.934
will not allow their futures
to be determined by bureaucrats

25:33.137 --> 25:36.129
at the beck and call
of industrialists like yourself,

25:36.307 --> 25:42.109
for whom the elderly and children
are just figures in a ledger.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.044
- Do I make myself clear?
- But...

25:45.216 --> 25:50.152
There are no buts. You can call
your guards and have me dragged out.

25:50.353 --> 25:55.222
- It would be bad publicity.
- Why don't just sit down?

25:55.425 --> 25:57.620
- I prefer to stand.
- We can stand.

25:58.295 --> 26:01.821
I've made it my business to find out
about Exo-Grey Industries.

26:02.031 --> 26:05.899
Facts that would make
interesting newspaper copy.

26:08.070 --> 26:14.134
- Your tea, Mr Farnsworth.
- Oh, right... Yeah. My tea.

26:15.478 --> 26:18.037
Will there be anything else,
Mr Farnsworth?

26:18.213 --> 26:20.613
No. I think that's about it.

26:20.982 --> 26:24.145
Thanks a lot. You want some tea?

26:24.319 --> 26:27.846
I want to know what
you're going to do about Pagglesham.

26:27.989 --> 26:31.220
Pagglesham!
It's what we're talking about!

26:31.392 --> 26:33.359
These people care
that their community

26:33.527 --> 26:37.327
isn't destroyed in the name
of free enterprise.

26:37.498 --> 26:42.299
A community where families
have lived for generations...

26:42.469 --> 26:43.868
I know about Pagglesham...

26:44.037 --> 26:47.973
These people will not let you
intimidate and frighten them.

26:48.141 --> 26:50.005
I don't frighten anybody.

27:03.589 --> 27:07.456
- What in God's name was that?
- Well, that was...

27:07.626 --> 27:10.527
...my... Mrs Farnsworth.

27:13.064 --> 27:17.398
Sorry to disturb you. Mrs Farnsworth
saw a mouse, but she's better now.

27:18.036 --> 27:23.200
- She just saw a mouse?
- No, outside. But she relives it.

27:23.374 --> 27:27.242
I'll be in the other room
if you need me, sir. Excuse me.

27:28.579 --> 27:32.310
- What's the matter with her?
- Well, listen...

27:32.483 --> 27:36.885
- It's really none of my business.
- Your wife's not your business?

27:37.020 --> 27:39.113
You don't understand...

27:39.289 --> 27:42.190
We will never let you build
that refinery.

27:42.358 --> 27:45.623
All right. I'll build my refinery
in some other place.

27:45.962 --> 27:50.422
Very funny. If you think I'm going
back to Pagglesham, you're wrong.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.033
I know you're not afraid of me.

27:52.235 --> 27:56.398
You think a schoolteacher is no
challenge for a famous industrialist,

27:56.605 --> 28:00.006
- but believe me...
- Will you please listen?

28:00.108 --> 28:04.340
Just be quiet a minute.
Just let me say one thing.

28:04.546 --> 28:06.844
- What is it?
- Sit down.

28:09.984 --> 28:11.212
Why?

28:11.419 --> 28:15.549
I think I can explain something
that'll clear this whole thing up.

28:25.131 --> 28:27.531
I'm not really Leo Farnsworth.

28:28.201 --> 28:30.499
- What?
- My name is Joe.

28:30.870 --> 28:37.275
Very funny. I'm sure you enjoy
playing these insulting little games.

28:37.444 --> 28:41.038
However, I know about
your board meeting on Thursday,

28:41.213 --> 28:43.078
which may mean nothing to you,

28:43.248 --> 28:46.581
but if you think you can treat women
with the same contempt

28:46.919 --> 28:49.444
your company treats
communities of the world,

28:49.655 --> 28:53.284
you've a lot to learn about
the strength of people like myself.

28:53.459 --> 28:56.621
Don't think you're getting away
with this. You're not!

29:02.467 --> 29:04.958
You got till that meeting
on Thursday

29:05.136 --> 29:07.866
to find me a body
that can play quarterback.

29:10.008 --> 29:12.272
Darling, I'm going to let you go.

29:12.442 --> 29:17.470
I'm going to let you go now.
Please stop screaming.

29:17.848 --> 29:20.874
Listen. There is nothing
to be frightened of.

29:21.051 --> 29:24.111
There's plenty to be worried about,
but nothing to be frightened of.

29:24.321 --> 29:29.883
Are you all right? Can I trust you?
Yes, dearest?

29:33.229 --> 29:35.220
- You locked me in a closet.
- For a moment.

29:35.431 --> 29:38.366
- What did you tell him?
- You saw a mouse.

29:38.534 --> 29:42.231
Look, I'm no good
at spur-of-the-moment alibis.

29:42.438 --> 29:46.203
He's probably got enough evidence
to lock us away forever.

29:46.374 --> 29:50.868
I don't understand this.
I saw him inhale the nose spray.

29:51.046 --> 29:55.073
He never really inhaled it.
He overheard us somehow.

29:55.250 --> 29:57.150
Maybe he's got us bugged right now.

29:57.318 --> 30:01.014
No, an electronics expert
sweeps the place daily.

30:01.188 --> 30:05.887
- He's afraid of being bugged, too.
- He's playing with us.

30:06.060 --> 30:08.620
He's playing a game with us,
that's what it is.

30:08.962 --> 30:13.490
- You locked me in a closet. Why?
- Hello.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.964
Mr Farnsworth would like
to see you now.

30:16.169 --> 30:19.536
Yes, indeed. Would you
excuse me, Mrs Farnsworth?

30:19.906 --> 30:22.170
Yes, of course, Mr Abbott.

30:25.344 --> 30:29.212
We could raise it at the meeting,
but I'm sure it's legal.

30:29.382 --> 30:32.316
But can't something be legal
but still wrong?

30:32.484 --> 30:35.282
- In what sense?
- Bad for somebody else.

30:35.454 --> 30:40.255
- What are you referring to?
- Like this refinery in Pagglesham.

30:42.194 --> 30:44.958
- Was that the living room?
- That was my office.

30:45.130 --> 30:47.462
- My coordination is shot?
- Yes, sir.

30:47.632 --> 30:50.031
- Just not my day.
- No, sir.

30:53.037 --> 30:57.133
I wanted to discuss the Haitian
arrangement. The 2.5 million acres.

30:57.308 --> 30:59.538
- 2.5 million acres?
- The sugar deal.

30:59.710 --> 31:01.575
- It's no good.
- The deal?

31:01.912 --> 31:06.280
- No, the sugar. It's bad for the body.
- Shall I speak to the ambassador?

31:06.449 --> 31:09.885
No, check on Pagglesham,
see if we're hurting anybody.

31:10.053 --> 31:12.544
- If we're hurting anybody?
- Yeah.

31:23.899 --> 31:26.197
Is the wicket bugged?

31:30.672 --> 31:32.537
We certainly wouldn't
want to hurt anybody.

31:32.908 --> 31:36.104
That's the last thing Exo-Grey
would ever want to do, right?

31:36.277 --> 31:40.338
Yeah. We don't want to hurt anybody.
Thank you.

31:43.017 --> 31:45.042
Pagglesham.

32:00.867 --> 32:04.359
He pretended not to know
what a stockholder was!

32:04.571 --> 32:08.870
I can't tell if he's toying with me
or actually precipitating a crisis.

32:09.041 --> 32:12.067
He's toying.
He won't forget being drugged.

32:12.278 --> 32:15.406
- Why would he pretend?
- Why pretend to inhale the spray?

32:15.581 --> 32:18.015
To bait us,
waiting for us to crack.

32:18.184 --> 32:22.245
Do you think he's playing
that saxophone? It's a tape.

32:22.421 --> 32:24.854
That's why we keep hearing
the same song.

32:25.023 --> 32:28.220
It's like those
idiot costumes of his...

32:29.394 --> 32:31.419
You are dumb, aren't you?

33:29.516 --> 33:32.144
Thanks. Thank you.

33:37.892 --> 33:39.860
<i>Their magic number is one,</i>

33:40.060 --> 33:42.926
<i>meaning a Ram victory Sunday
or next week against the Falcons</i>

33:43.129 --> 33:48.089
<i>or a 49er loss, and the Rams clinch
the NFL Western Division title.</i>

33:48.301 --> 33:50.030
<i>The way they're playing,</i>

33:50.203 --> 33:54.537
<i>the team feels this is the Rams' year
to go to the Super Bowl.</i>

33:54.908 --> 33:59.003
<i>Jarrett has completed
an astounding 62% of his passes</i>

33:59.211 --> 34:01.509
<i>for 18 touchdowns.</i>

34:01.847 --> 34:04.281
<i>The defence has given up
but 10 points a game,</i>

34:04.483 --> 34:07.281
<i>while the offence
scores 21 points a game.</i>

34:07.452 --> 34:09.317
<i>Their record is the best...</i>

34:35.178 --> 34:38.545
What you mean is
nobody should have that information,

34:38.915 --> 34:44.045
because if two big companies get
together, they're worth more money?

34:44.154 --> 34:45.313
Yes, sir.

34:45.487 --> 34:49.889
That's why the rumour of a merger
makes the price of the stock rise.

34:50.025 --> 34:54.860
If it's supposed to be a secret,
how does the rumour start?

34:55.664 --> 34:58.360
Wrong as it seems,
they leak it.

34:58.567 --> 35:02.502
- But that's dishonest.
- Yes, it is.

35:15.083 --> 35:17.051
If I got a board meeting tomorrow,

35:17.218 --> 35:18.912
I got to study tonight.

35:19.119 --> 35:23.453
- Yes, sir.
- How you doing down there?

35:23.623 --> 35:26.421
I'm doing fine.
Thank you very much. Very well.

35:28.095 --> 35:31.087
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

35:33.934 --> 35:35.867
Say, thanks for dinner.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.406
I think we should do it right away.

35:44.577 --> 35:47.569
Sisk, may we have some
more coffee, please?

36:13.871 --> 36:15.839
And now for your hat, sir.

36:16.040 --> 36:18.065
The homburg or the bowler,

36:18.275 --> 36:21.574
or something that makes
more of a statement?

36:21.944 --> 36:27.007
Whatever you say. Why have I got
so many of these sailor outfits?

36:27.183 --> 36:30.983
Sir, you have
always fancied the sea.

36:31.187 --> 36:35.590
- Do I sail?
- Not really, sir.

37:32.044 --> 37:35.980
Helen Rich from The Times.
I have a petition from Pagglesham.

37:36.148 --> 37:37.581
Do you plan to do anything?

37:37.916 --> 37:42.181
We're considering it.
We have to be going. Excuse us.

37:44.188 --> 37:48.249
Is it true that the new factories
will displace 11 communities?

37:48.426 --> 37:51.589
- Is it that many?
- They granted permits, didn't they?

37:51.963 --> 37:56.093
- I guess so, if we got 'em.
- How did you get those permits?

37:56.300 --> 37:58.460
Beats me. I guess we bribed somebody.

37:58.869 --> 38:00.359
- He's joking.
- Funny.

38:00.537 --> 38:02.971
Really, we must be going.

38:04.141 --> 38:07.338
- What about Acrilonitrile?
- What about what?

38:07.511 --> 38:11.242
The toxic substance released
by the plastic bottles you market,

38:11.414 --> 38:15.474
despite the lawsuit forcing you
to delay until the effects are tested.

38:15.851 --> 38:20.117
- We really must go.
- I've been studying this thing.

38:20.289 --> 38:24.385
I've got it figured out, so come
and see what's going on yourselves.

38:24.593 --> 38:28.120
- You can't have outsiders...
- Sure we can. Come in, everybody.

38:28.297 --> 38:30.025
Is he kidding?

38:52.452 --> 38:55.148
Hi. How you doing, everybody?

38:55.322 --> 38:57.813
These people are
newspaper reporters.

38:57.991 --> 39:02.757
I thought it would be good
if they saw how we did things.

39:02.895 --> 39:05.261
This is a very dangerous precedent.

39:05.431 --> 39:11.529
We have a full agenda today already.
We don't have time for a press...

39:12.905 --> 39:15.465
Is it true that an accident
in your nuclear plant

39:15.841 --> 39:18.536
could stimulate seismic activity
in the San Andreas Fault,

39:18.877 --> 39:21.971
and destroy
most of southern California?

39:22.147 --> 39:24.445
I think you'd have
to define "destroy".

39:24.816 --> 39:29.014
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to make something clear.

39:29.187 --> 39:32.418
The Exo-Grey nuclear facility
has a foolproof

39:32.591 --> 39:36.890
built-in safety system that
guarantees no danger of any kind.

39:37.061 --> 39:38.995
That's rubbish.

39:39.196 --> 39:42.563
If there's no danger,
why are we in a lawsuit?

39:43.334 --> 39:45.325
It's a protest, not a lawsuit.

39:45.536 --> 39:48.369
The point is
we're doing something wrong.

39:48.539 --> 39:52.065
Everybody's suing us.
We got a lawsuit from a refinery...

39:52.275 --> 39:56.871
...a nuclear lawsuit,
a guy named Porpoise is suing us.

39:57.080 --> 40:00.811
Mr Farnsworth,
that's an ecological suit

40:00.984 --> 40:03.919
against our canning factory
for destroying porpoises.

40:07.322 --> 40:12.021
- For God's sake, he knows that.
- We can porpoises?

40:12.227 --> 40:13.216
Our San Diego fleet...

40:13.395 --> 40:16.523
As everybody knows, we can tuna,

40:16.898 --> 40:20.425
and in netting the tuna,
we kill a number of porpoises.

40:20.601 --> 40:24.901
Since they're mammals
of alleged high intelligence,

40:25.072 --> 40:27.006
there's been an outcry.

40:27.174 --> 40:31.975
Yeah, well... Yeah... Yeah.

40:32.346 --> 40:35.440
I would just like
to ask you a question.

40:35.616 --> 40:39.608
- Why is he bringing the press here?
- You know Leo Farnsworth.

40:39.953 --> 40:43.184
- Maybe I don't know him.
- Exactly.

40:43.356 --> 40:47.087
We have responsibility
to thousands of shareholders

40:47.294 --> 40:52.163
of moderate means, less well off than
the ecological groups fighting us.

40:54.333 --> 40:58.997
If we were a football team,
would you call this a winning season?

41:01.974 --> 41:03.271
I haven't the faintest...

41:03.442 --> 41:06.934
Just generally. Would you say
we got a winning season?

41:08.946 --> 41:11.437
On balance,
we've had an extremely good year.

41:11.616 --> 41:13.846
We've got a winning season.

41:14.052 --> 41:16.350
What do you do
when you're ahead?

41:16.521 --> 41:20.981
- I don't know what you want.
- You don't make mistakes.

41:21.159 --> 41:24.559
You don't gamble unnecessarily.
You protect your lead.

41:24.928 --> 41:29.092
You don't pass from your own end.
You make sure nobody gets hurt.

41:29.266 --> 41:32.133
You got to use these guys
in the next game.

41:32.336 --> 41:37.433
We won this game. We got to stay
in shape for the rest of the game.

41:37.607 --> 41:40.541
It's like when everybody was supposed
to stop eating grapes.

41:40.876 --> 41:46.576
I didn't because I like grapes.
A lot of guys will keep eating tuna.

41:46.916 --> 41:50.579
What if we had a good-guy
tuna company on the porpoise team?

41:50.953 --> 41:53.945
A lot of guys would buy that so
their kids wouldn't get mad at them.

41:55.524 --> 41:58.959
I don't think they're
taking into account the expense.

41:59.160 --> 42:03.187
We don't care how much it costs,
just how much it makes.

42:03.365 --> 42:06.857
If it costs too much,
we charge a penny more.

42:07.035 --> 42:09.026
Would you pay more
to save a fish who thinks?

42:09.204 --> 42:12.195
- That's not bad.
- We handle all lawsuits that way.

42:12.373 --> 42:15.308
Let other teams build plants
in the wrong places.

42:15.476 --> 42:17.205
Let the other quarterback
throw a gurgle

42:17.411 --> 42:21.347
so newspapers get hold of it
and stockholders don't like it.

42:21.515 --> 42:25.508
Let's be the team that makes
the rules, plays fair,

42:25.853 --> 42:28.082
that gets the best contract,
that's popular.

42:28.254 --> 42:32.554
Forget these nuclear power plants
until we know they're safe.

42:32.892 --> 42:36.157
That Pagglesham refinery,
we'll have to relocate it.

42:36.329 --> 42:39.127
It'll cost us $35 million,
but we don't care,

42:39.332 --> 42:43.268
because we'll come out ahead
in the end.

42:43.436 --> 42:46.199
That plastic stuff we're making,
we'll have to stop.

42:46.405 --> 42:48.430
We're not here for just one game.

42:48.607 --> 42:51.599
We're going all the way
to the Super Bowl!

42:51.943 --> 42:52.773
And we'll already have won!

43:19.602 --> 43:23.333
- Hi. How you doing?
- Fine, thank you. Very well...

43:25.208 --> 43:26.368
What's happening?

43:26.543 --> 43:30.240
<i>... give the Rams advantage
through the playoffs.</i>

43:30.447 --> 43:33.381
<i>The Super Bowl is set
for the Coliseum.</i>

43:33.549 --> 43:38.384
If he weren't going to be dead soon,
he'd need years of psychiatric help.

43:38.554 --> 43:41.045
Let's do it tonight.

43:41.223 --> 43:46.058
<i>The Rams will probably face Dallas
in the opening round. If they win...</i>

43:46.228 --> 43:49.321
- Mr Pendleton.
- Hey!

43:50.565 --> 43:53.557
Am I glad to see you.
Line up any bodies yet?

43:53.935 --> 43:56.369
We haven't got a lot of time. If...

44:00.808 --> 44:03.867
<i>... and only four measly field goals...</i>

44:04.077 --> 44:06.272
Hi. I... I'm just...

44:29.368 --> 44:33.361
- What's up?
- Some interesting probabilities.

44:33.539 --> 44:37.338
I kept my word to Betty Logan.
Did you find a body in good shape?

44:37.509 --> 44:39.306
<i>I want to see some bodies.</i>

44:41.513 --> 44:44.846
<i>... someone who can throw.
The Super Bowl's coming up.</i>

44:44.983 --> 44:47.918
<i>You must have checked out
a lot of bodies...</i>

44:50.088 --> 44:53.113
- Who is it?
- It's Sisk, sir.

44:54.391 --> 44:56.052
Come in, Sisk.

45:01.965 --> 45:05.901
Sorry to disturb you, Mr Farnsworth,
but Miss Logan is downstairs

45:06.069 --> 45:09.834
and asks if she might have
a moment of your time.

45:14.110 --> 45:17.546
- Tell her I'll be right down.
- Very good, sir.

45:19.181 --> 45:22.480
Do you...? Do you wish
the door closed, sir?

45:24.085 --> 45:26.918
Closed is fine. Thank you.

45:33.595 --> 45:34.789
Do your best.
I gotta find out what she wants.

45:52.947 --> 45:57.212
I don't know what you must think
of me after my behaviour,

45:57.383 --> 46:01.376
but I feel I must tell you what
an extraordinary thing you did today.

46:01.554 --> 46:06.184
- Really quite extraordinary.
- You don't have to say...

46:06.392 --> 46:08.360
- Because I...
- It's...

46:08.528 --> 46:13.294
You know what? You look a little
pale. You want something to eat?

46:13.465 --> 46:15.092
- Well...
- I'll be right back.

46:15.300 --> 46:20.795
Bentley. Everett. Miss Logan's
going to have dinner with us.

46:21.006 --> 46:25.170
Whip up a liver and whey shake.
Where you going?

46:25.377 --> 46:26.809
Oh, I thought...

46:26.978 --> 46:32.348
You thought I meant to go out.
Sisk, we're going out. Come on.

46:32.516 --> 46:36.782
Bentley! Everett!
We're going out and eat. Good idea.

46:36.954 --> 46:40.890
- Which hat would you prefer?
- Look, I don't want a hat.

46:41.058 --> 46:44.959
I'm sick of hats. Don't show me
any more hats. Understand?

46:45.128 --> 46:48.461
Yes, sir. No more hats.

47:10.786 --> 47:15.813
- Do you eat here often?
- Are you...? Now, look...

47:19.794 --> 47:24.026
I just didn't think you'd want people
to see you out with a guy like me.

47:25.366 --> 47:26.799
I see.

47:44.384 --> 47:46.010
<i>Pick up 24. Pick up 28.</i>

47:46.585 --> 47:51.147
I'm sorry. I just can't stop
staring at you.

47:58.330 --> 48:00.389
I seem to be staring at you, too.

48:08.206 --> 48:11.937
Even when I was trying to hate you,
I saw something else.

48:12.844 --> 48:15.210
- Something...
- What?

48:16.448 --> 48:18.438
In your eyes. Does that sound silly?

48:23.120 --> 48:27.250
When you see that, it doesn't matter
who a person is or anything.

48:33.030 --> 48:34.394
What is it?

48:36.466 --> 48:40.425
This isn't what I thought
was going to happen to me.

48:43.272 --> 48:47.265
Listen, I got to talk
to somebody right away.

48:47.477 --> 48:49.502
Would you mind if I took you home?

49:01.289 --> 49:04.053
- Good night.
- Good night.

49:06.393 --> 49:08.361
By the way, I'm getting a divorce.

49:09.897 --> 49:11.762
But you're not even separated.

49:11.932 --> 49:14.332
Sure we are. It's a big house.

49:37.923 --> 49:41.017
- How you doing, Bentley?
- Fine, sir.

49:54.172 --> 49:57.505
<i>I don't want that body
we talked about.</i>

49:57.875 --> 49:59.069
<i>Something happened tonight...</i>

49:59.243 --> 50:01.177
This is an outrage.

50:01.345 --> 50:04.007
We've gone to enormous difficulty
to find an athlete.

50:04.182 --> 50:09.983
I wanted it, but something happened
with Betty Logan and now I don't.

50:10.153 --> 50:11.882
I'll get Farnsworth into shape.

50:12.055 --> 50:15.047
<i>I'll get Corkle to help me.</i>

50:15.258 --> 50:17.818
- Back in there?
- Oh, yes.

50:17.994 --> 50:22.328
I can do it. I know more about
getting into shape than anybody.

50:22.499 --> 50:25.399
- So hold up on that body.
- Hold up?

50:25.568 --> 50:28.469
Tell Mr Jordan not to worry about it.
Thank him.

50:28.838 --> 50:31.966
I'm sorry, I want to get
into shape with this body.

50:32.141 --> 50:35.872
You leave me speechless.
I have nothing to say to that.

50:36.045 --> 50:37.842
I can't even think how to retort

50:38.013 --> 50:40.981
to something as ridiculous
as turning down a body

50:41.149 --> 50:43.879
we've gone to such extremes to find.

50:44.052 --> 50:47.818
An athlete in prime condition.
What can I say?

50:48.022 --> 50:49.580
What do I do with his cocoa?

50:49.924 --> 50:53.382
I don't want to disturb him,
but dare I let it get cold?

50:53.561 --> 50:56.155
I notice there are two cups.

50:56.364 --> 50:59.958
Sisk felt since he was pretending
to talk to somebody,

51:00.167 --> 51:03.227
he might want to pretend
to give him cocoa, too.

51:04.805 --> 51:07.797
How you doing, Everett?
How you doing, Bentley?

51:13.212 --> 51:18.411
Hurry up. Wait a minute.
Just a minute, please. All right.

51:19.118 --> 51:23.782
Sorry to bother you, but we don't
love each other. Let's get divorced.

51:25.925 --> 51:29.018
- I don't know what you're saying.
- Come on. Yes, you do.

51:29.227 --> 51:32.458
Abbott, there's a trainer
for the Rams named Max Corkle.

51:32.831 --> 51:36.562
Could you call and ask him
to come see me?

51:36.902 --> 51:40.338
- Yes, Mr Farnsworth.
- Thank you. Good night.

51:41.139 --> 51:44.199
You idiot! You idiot!
Why did you answer him?

51:44.376 --> 51:47.208
I couldn't resist.
His will is too strong.

51:48.345 --> 51:52.076
<i>That's our weekend forecast.
Now here's tonight's sports.</i>

51:52.249 --> 51:55.275
<i>Leach and Char will have to...</i>

51:55.452 --> 51:58.182
He's dead. It's over with.

52:03.526 --> 52:07.155
At last, at last.
At last, my dearest.

52:07.363 --> 52:09.126
It's incredible.

52:12.001 --> 52:15.767
Yes! Just a minute. Yes!
Yes, Sisk.

52:16.538 --> 52:20.770
And, Abbott, Corkle's number
is 654-1654. All right?

52:20.909 --> 52:23.776
- Yes, Mr Farnsworth.
- OK.

52:23.912 --> 52:25.812
Oh, my God.

52:27.582 --> 52:29.277
Right this way.

52:29.451 --> 52:34.114
Mr Farnsworth is waiting for you
in the ballroom. Follow me, please.

52:43.064 --> 52:47.398
- Mr Corkle, sir.
- Max. How you doing?

52:49.269 --> 52:50.896
Fine.

52:52.906 --> 52:58.071
- Lost a little weight, huh?
- Have we met?

52:58.244 --> 53:02.180
Sort of, yeah. Thanks, Sisk.

53:06.352 --> 53:08.411
I hear you got all Joe Pendleton's
athletic equipment.

53:08.787 --> 53:11.483
Yeah. How d'you know that?

53:11.824 --> 53:15.089
I'd like to buy it.
I'd like to bring it in here.

53:15.260 --> 53:18.388
No, I'm sorry, Mr Farnsworth.
That's not for sale.

53:19.832 --> 53:20.991
What do you want it for?

53:21.165 --> 53:24.066
I've got to get in shape.
I'd like you to help me train.

53:24.235 --> 53:27.261
- Train?
- Yeah. As soon as I'm ready...

53:30.341 --> 53:34.038
I want you to get me
a tryout with the Rams.

53:34.245 --> 53:37.179
- What are you trying out for?
- Quarterback.

53:37.981 --> 53:39.141
Quarterback?

53:42.452 --> 53:45.285
The point is, Mr Farnsworth,

53:45.455 --> 53:48.822
we already got a quarterback
working with the team.

53:48.992 --> 53:52.290
We got a couple
of pretty good backups.

53:52.461 --> 53:54.486
You call Hodges good, huh?

53:55.965 --> 53:59.366
The point is
we don't need a quarterback.

53:59.568 --> 54:01.263
Why don't you try another team?

54:01.437 --> 54:05.237
The Oakland Raiders are close.
Give them a call.

54:05.408 --> 54:08.342
I want to play quarterback
and get in shape for the Super Bowl.

54:08.543 --> 54:10.773
What would it cost to try out?

54:10.912 --> 54:15.406
Look, Mr Farnsworth,
no team wants a crazy trainer,

54:15.784 --> 54:19.117
and only a crazy trainer
would arrange a tryout for you.

54:19.287 --> 54:21.812
You keep your money,
I'll keep my job,

54:21.990 --> 54:25.516
and we'll keep this little
misunderstanding to ourselves.

54:27.895 --> 54:30.193
That's all right,
I'll finish that up.

54:30.364 --> 54:33.856
What would you say if I told you
I was a professional football player?

54:36.070 --> 54:41.507
- These... These are nice.
- Max, you know how people die?

54:42.341 --> 54:45.276
Yeah. Why?

54:45.445 --> 54:48.778
And after they die,
they go to heaven?

54:48.981 --> 54:52.075
I guess, if they're good.
I mean, why not?

54:53.853 --> 54:55.911
You know how it works in heaven?

54:56.088 --> 55:02.118
- Not exactly.
- It's probability and outcome.

55:02.327 --> 55:03.919
I never knew that.

55:04.096 --> 55:06.963
Say there's a probability
that some guy's going to die.

55:07.165 --> 55:10.157
An escort from his way station
gets a signal.

55:10.368 --> 55:13.894
He goes down
and waits for the outcome.

55:14.071 --> 55:16.096
If the guy lives,
the escort wasted a trip.

55:16.273 --> 55:19.800
If he dies, he takes him back
to his way station.

55:19.977 --> 55:24.073
He puts him in line for his
final destination. You follow?

55:24.281 --> 55:25.305
Mind if I smoke?

55:25.483 --> 55:30.010
Go ahead. Let's say there's
a new escort. He gets a signal.

55:30.186 --> 55:33.849
He takes off and sees a guy
riding a bicycle into a tunnel.

55:34.023 --> 55:37.151
The car's coming the other way,
the escort's supposed to wait,

55:37.360 --> 55:41.319
but he's new and figures
the guy's a goner.

55:41.498 --> 55:45.024
He figures,
why should I have the car hit him?

55:45.234 --> 55:47.361
Why not take him out
a few seconds early

55:47.569 --> 55:50.094
and take him up to his way station?

55:50.272 --> 55:56.871
- Listen, I need a match.
- That clock, that's a lighter.

55:57.045 --> 56:01.378
So the guy he takes up to the way
station isn't just some ordinary guy.

56:01.749 --> 56:03.717
He's an athlete
with fantastic reflexes.

56:03.918 --> 56:06.045
He wouldn't have hit
the car at all.

56:06.220 --> 56:08.848
- How do you light this?
- There.

56:09.023 --> 56:11.184
The guy wasn't really dead.

56:11.359 --> 56:14.988
His number wasn't up for years.
He would have missed the car.

56:15.195 --> 56:19.757
No kidding? Is this lighter right?

56:19.933 --> 56:24.029
They're supposed to put him back
in his body, but he's been cremated.

56:24.237 --> 56:27.866
- They have to find another body.
- Look, Mr Farnsworth.

56:28.041 --> 56:33.376
I'm just a trainer. What you need
is a really good doctor.

56:33.546 --> 56:39.849
- Don't you understand?
- Sure. That's a hell of a story.

56:40.052 --> 56:43.920
Mr Jordan, I'm so glad to see you!

56:44.089 --> 56:46.751
I'm trying to get
Farnsworth into shape.

56:46.925 --> 56:50.019
- I want Corkle to help.
- Who are you talking to?

56:50.195 --> 56:54.154
Mr Jordan. He runs the way station.

56:54.332 --> 56:56.391
You can't see him.
You're still alive.

56:56.568 --> 56:59.162
You two probably got a lot
to talk about. I'll be on my way.

56:59.337 --> 57:03.033
- Wait a second, Max.
- Tell him who you are, Joe.

57:03.207 --> 57:06.108
He'll never believe me, you tell him.

57:06.310 --> 57:08.744
He's the only person who can get me
a tryout with the Rams.

57:08.912 --> 57:12.040
You can make him believe you.

57:12.216 --> 57:13.478
- Look at me.
- Mr Farnsworth...

57:13.850 --> 57:17.149
Max! I'm not Farnsworth.
I'm Joe Pendleton.

57:17.321 --> 57:19.982
Farnsworth's wife
and secretary murdered him.

57:20.189 --> 57:23.158
This is a body they found for me.

57:23.359 --> 57:25.759
They drugged him,
then I stepped in.

57:25.928 --> 57:30.024
It's not bad material.
I can get it into shape.

57:30.199 --> 57:33.930
- I don't want to hear any more.
- Max, please.

57:34.103 --> 57:36.093
I want to get out of here.

57:36.271 --> 57:39.763
I won't tell a word to anybody.
I promise. It'll be our little secret.

57:39.941 --> 57:43.968
A secret? Like your sister
and the Coca-Cola salesman?

57:44.179 --> 57:49.139
- What about the scar on your tongue?
- How did you...?

57:49.317 --> 57:52.479
What did you do
at your uncle's wedding?

57:54.121 --> 57:57.852
What about the first time
I fixed your neck in Pittsburgh?

57:59.927 --> 58:03.693
Now do you believe me, Max?
Please say you believe me.

58:03.831 --> 58:07.823
They don't have a team in heaven,
so God couldn't make me first-string.

58:08.901 --> 58:10.163
He doesn't believe me.

58:10.336 --> 58:13.863
Try a little music.
That's a great persuader.

58:27.853 --> 58:30.219
Joe, you never could play that thing.

58:35.460 --> 58:39.793
You all right, Max? You all right?

58:43.934 --> 58:49.065
Bentley! Whip up a liver and whey
shake right away!

58:52.276 --> 58:55.108
I'm gonna play in the Super Bowl.

58:55.278 --> 58:57.143
That's what's coming to me.

58:57.314 --> 58:59.509
If that's what you've got coming.

58:59.783 --> 59:01.876
- He's still here?
- Right there.

59:02.085 --> 59:05.179
Listen to me.
Farnsworth isn't in bad shape.

59:05.355 --> 59:09.257
I still know the moves.
Just help me with the body.

59:10.492 --> 59:12.323
Thanks, Mr Jordan.

59:15.197 --> 59:19.395
Sisk! How about that liver
and whey shake? Hurry up.

59:19.735 --> 59:22.829
- I need it for Mr Corkle.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

59:23.038 --> 59:27.098
I want the whole staff to suit up.
We're going into training.

59:33.781 --> 59:35.874
Listen, Mr... Jordan, is it?

59:40.154 --> 59:43.020
You still there?

59:43.190 --> 59:48.321
Any time you want to chime in...
why, just feel free.

59:48.495 --> 59:51.123
Feel free.
I'm telling you to feel free!

59:51.298 --> 59:53.732
You got to help me
talk Joe out of this.

59:53.934 --> 59:56.266
If I get him a tryout,

59:56.436 --> 59:59.927
that team will put him
out of commission like that.

01:00:01.073 --> 01:00:06.067
Christ, I can't even snap
my fingers any more. Sorry.

01:00:07.079 --> 01:00:08.706
He's not there.
Don't get crazy. I'm counting on you.

01:00:54.223 --> 01:00:55.986
This isn't going to work.

01:01:01.297 --> 01:01:03.230
We're fooling with the Rams.

01:01:09.371 --> 01:01:11.771
It's just... Well, all right.

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:25.847
I'm still figuring out
what I'll say.

01:01:45.238 --> 01:01:48.401
You're playing football
with a bunch of butlers.

01:01:48.575 --> 01:01:51.338
- This isn't gonna work!
- I fixed all that.

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:54.877
- How?
- I bought the Rams.

01:01:57.316 --> 01:02:02.879
Leo Farnsworth has bought this team,
and he wants to play quarterback.

01:02:03.088 --> 01:02:05.351
- Shit!
- Crazy son of a bitch.

01:02:05.523 --> 01:02:07.047
Bullshit!

01:02:07.258 --> 01:02:09.886
Wait a minute.
This is the way it is.

01:02:10.061 --> 01:02:13.997
He'll play quarterback
in Wednesday's scrimmage.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.132
At which time,
the coach will decide

01:02:16.334 --> 01:02:18.894
whether he's qualified
for the job or not.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:22.732
Mr Farnsworth says,
"Tell no one to hold back."

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.965
These were his words, I quote,

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:27.371
"Play that scrimmage
like the Super Bowl."

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:30.843
- Take him at his word.
- Let's kill him.

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:36.978
My team.
That son of a bitch got my team.

01:02:37.152 --> 01:02:40.451
What kind of pressure
did he use, Milt?

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:45.851
Well, I asked for 67 million,
and he said OK.

01:02:47.062 --> 01:02:48.962
Ruthless bastard.

01:03:01.075 --> 01:03:05.239
Well, very, very nice.
Very, very, impressive.

01:03:05.446 --> 01:03:09.211
I'm Tony Abbott, Mr Farnsworth's
personal private executive secretary.

01:03:09.383 --> 01:03:11.908
Very nice. Very... very nice.

01:03:12.085 --> 01:03:16.749
Don't let any of Mr Farnsworth's
racial statements offend you.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.419
Nice talking to you.

01:03:50.522 --> 01:03:53.491
Get rid of that ball fast, all right?

01:03:53.825 --> 01:03:55.349
Good luck, Mr Farnsworth.

01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:03.093
Don't worry about the plays.
I got them down last night.

01:04:03.267 --> 01:04:09.035
I want to run a split right, X-go,
Z-curl, a Y-straight.

01:04:09.206 --> 01:04:11.731
Like the Super Bowl. Break.

01:04:18.881 --> 01:04:23.113
- Ready? Break.
- Tighten it up.

01:04:23.286 --> 01:04:24.480
Look at 'em.

01:04:25.154 --> 01:04:28.123
That's how they look when they eat.

01:04:30.792 --> 01:04:33.818
- Look out.
- 4-3, set!

01:04:35.764 --> 01:04:39.291
2-85... 2-85!

01:04:47.808 --> 01:04:49.002
Sorry, Mr Farnsworth.

01:04:53.781 --> 01:04:57.410
- Nice.
- Let's try it again, Mr Farnsworth.

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:00.809
OK, let's go! Let's go!

01:05:01.021 --> 01:05:05.720
Try it with the ball!
Come on, positions!

01:05:05.925 --> 01:05:09.918
- Playing football is so much fun.
- Try this time.

01:05:10.096 --> 01:05:12.860
- Set!
- Come on now!

01:05:13.033 --> 01:05:14.933
2-81!

01:05:28.514 --> 01:05:32.779
I'm terribly sorry, Mr Farnsworth.
This is really embarrassing.

01:05:36.054 --> 01:05:38.147
I guess you went offsides.

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:42.088
Come on, guys,
get him, get him!

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:45.229
Give me a little more room, Billy.

01:05:47.532 --> 01:05:50.364
Let's all try and stay onsides.

01:05:54.871 --> 01:05:57.396
- Better get a stretcher.
- Jesus!

01:05:57.774 --> 01:06:00.334
He's an eccentric.
We've always known that.

01:06:00.744 --> 01:06:05.373
Buying a football team for 67 million
that has a book value of 19?

01:06:05.715 --> 01:06:08.445
Three weeks ago,
the stock was selling at 56.

01:06:08.784 --> 01:06:11.378
This morning it opened at 14.

01:06:15.257 --> 01:06:18.124
- You want a rest, Mr Farnsworth?
- No, it's OK.

01:06:18.327 --> 01:06:23.730
Mr Farnsworth is taking the Rams
to the Super Bowl as a quarterback.

01:06:23.898 --> 01:06:27.197
No sign of aberration
in his behaviour?

01:06:27.368 --> 01:06:30.269
Nothing in his personal life
bothering him?

01:06:30.438 --> 01:06:32.201
That statement speaks for itself.

01:06:33.408 --> 01:06:35.898
All right, I'm going to save
you guys some trouble.

01:06:36.777 --> 01:06:39.712
Want me to quit?
Give me the ball once.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:42.939
If I don't hit Evans,
I'll quit. Ready?

01:06:46.987 --> 01:06:48.284
Look out!

01:06:52.358 --> 01:06:54.292
On three! Set!

01:07:00.867 --> 01:07:02.698
Beautiful!

01:07:05.037 --> 01:07:06.971
There's a potential there! He's...

01:07:10.976 --> 01:07:13.001
- Take it easy.
- I know.

01:07:13.178 --> 01:07:16.841
- Shit, man, what you doing?
- What's he doing?

01:07:17.015 --> 01:07:19.040
Ready? Break.

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:22.811
Red right, red right. Watch the pass.

01:07:32.763 --> 01:07:34.287
Not bad.

01:07:45.108 --> 01:07:47.702
I think we got us
a rich quarterback.

01:08:03.192 --> 01:08:04.921
He's looking awful good.

01:08:12.033 --> 01:08:14.001
Boy, you pulled it off.

01:08:14.202 --> 01:08:17.968
Yeah? I don't know.
I think I can do it.

01:08:19.807 --> 01:08:22.435
Mr Farnsworth, play any college ball?

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.278
No. I played a little polo.

01:08:34.254 --> 01:08:37.814
Look, he's posing
with the whole football team.

01:08:38.024 --> 01:08:39.457
That's not a football team.

01:08:39.792 --> 01:08:42.694
There are old men
and skinny younger men.

01:08:42.828 --> 01:08:44.819
Look at the women.

01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:47.022
That's the ecology group
Exo-Grey is funding.

01:08:47.198 --> 01:08:50.395
He's getting ready to spring a trap.
This whole thing.

01:08:50.736 --> 01:08:54.796
The football team gag,
the ecology crap, the divorce...

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:58.805
He hasn't announced
is our divorce and when he does,

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.774
I'll be the first suspect
when we kill him.

01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:06.417
Darling, perhaps I'm being silly,
but I'd be more comfortable...

01:09:06.751 --> 01:09:09.117
Have I offended you in some way?

01:09:11.456 --> 01:09:13.390
Don't put your hand
over my mouth.

01:09:13.725 --> 01:09:17.751
- You used to like it.
- If we don't act now, we'll lose it.

01:09:17.928 --> 01:09:20.828
I was mad to sign
a prenuptial agreement.

01:09:20.997 --> 01:09:24.058
I'll get an allowance.
You'll be fired.

01:09:24.234 --> 01:09:27.100
- We'll have each other.
- Not after he brings charges...

01:09:27.304 --> 01:09:29.238
Don't try it!

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:22.937
Want to make a wish?

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:27.710
- Yes.
- All right. There.

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:33.279
- Go ahead.
- Very good.

01:11:47.268 --> 01:11:49.964
Do you think it's silly,
trying to be a football player?

01:11:50.171 --> 01:11:52.264
Of course not. That's what you want.

01:11:53.241 --> 01:11:56.801
- You think I can do it?
- You can do anything you want to.

01:11:57.010 --> 01:12:01.743
Anything you committed yourself
to do, you could do.

01:12:01.915 --> 01:12:05.351
Because I'm a big wheel
at Exo-Grey?

01:12:05.752 --> 01:12:10.017
- You're not afraid of things.
- Afraid of things? Why would I be?

01:12:11.257 --> 01:12:14.920
You know, most people are
afraid of something, aren't they?

01:12:15.828 --> 01:12:18.956
You want to know
the only thing I'm afraid of?

01:12:23.502 --> 01:12:26.470
How I'd feel
if I couldn't be with you.

01:12:29.174 --> 01:12:32.337
Then there's nothing
to be afraid of, is there?

01:12:34.245 --> 01:12:37.737
- Got to go.
- Wait a minute. I...

01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:41.112
How would you feel about marrying me?

01:12:47.524 --> 01:12:52.723
- It's crazy?
- No, it doesn't sound crazy.

01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:58.733
- You know, if I...
- What is it? What is it?

01:12:59.235 --> 01:12:59.701
Could you wait here?
I'll be right back.

01:13:11.914 --> 01:13:14.677
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry, Mr Pendleton.

01:13:14.816 --> 01:13:17.979
You won't be able to use
Mr Farnsworth's body any longer.

01:13:19.955 --> 01:13:21.252
What are you talking about?

01:13:21.456 --> 01:13:23.981
Just what I said.
Your time is up.

01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:26.127
You said I'd get to the Super Bowl.

01:13:26.328 --> 01:13:29.785
Whatever you do, it won't be
with Mr Farnsworth's body.

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:34.292
- Why not?
- It wasn't meant to be.

01:13:34.502 --> 01:13:37.403
- Why not?
- Stop saying that!

01:13:37.738 --> 01:13:39.433
I won't pay for your mistake.

01:13:39.773 --> 01:13:42.742
- Look, Mr Pendleton...
- I'm not talking to you.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:44.845
I'd like to talk to Mr Jordan.

01:13:45.044 --> 01:13:49.981
We'll settle this once and for all.
Get out of here. You're bad news.

01:13:58.758 --> 01:14:00.316
Is something wrong?

01:14:00.693 --> 01:14:04.685
I just got to straighten
something out.

01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:07.731
Maybe I better walk you to the car.

01:14:23.481 --> 01:14:26.678
Something is wrong, isn't it?

01:14:26.817 --> 01:14:29.149
- I was just thinking, Betty.
- What?

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.016
We got a great life ahead,
you and me,

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:35.056
and nobody's going
to take that away from us.

01:14:37.127 --> 01:14:39.721
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:14:39.896 --> 01:14:43.889
I'm memorising your face. I want
to memorise everything about you

01:14:44.067 --> 01:14:47.195
so no matter what happens,
I won't forget you.

01:14:47.404 --> 01:14:50.895
- What's going to happen?
- Nothing's going to happen.

01:14:51.974 --> 01:14:54.943
You'd never forget me either,
would you?

01:14:55.144 --> 01:14:59.444
That thing you said you saw in me.
Something in my eyes, remember?

01:14:59.715 --> 01:15:02.343
If some day somebody came up to you,
maybe a football player,

01:15:02.685 --> 01:15:04.879
and he acted like
he'd seen you before,

01:15:05.053 --> 01:15:07.180
you'd notice that same thing, right?

01:15:07.355 --> 01:15:10.256
You'd give him a chance?
He might be a good guy.

01:15:10.425 --> 01:15:15.158
- He could even be a quarterback.
- I don't understand.

01:15:16.464 --> 01:15:18.193
I'm just acting crazy.

01:15:38.818 --> 01:15:42.254
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:16:19.223 --> 01:16:23.023
- You must abide by what is written.
- Why?

01:16:23.227 --> 01:16:27.253
There's a reason for everything.
There's always a plan.

01:16:27.463 --> 01:16:30.796
- How can I give up Farnsworth now?
- I'm sorry, Joe.

01:16:30.967 --> 01:16:34.869
- You said I'd get to the Super Bowl.
- Yes, if it's meant to be.

01:16:35.038 --> 01:16:36.437
- I'm not leaving.
- Sorry.

01:16:36.806 --> 01:16:38.273
I'm not leaving, Mr Jordan.

01:16:38.441 --> 01:16:42.206
Joe, you asked
for a temporary arrangement.

01:16:42.377 --> 01:16:46.370
I never went back on a deal,
but I am now. I'm not going.

01:16:46.748 --> 01:16:50.946
Your destiny is not in my hands.
Please don't make it more difficult.

01:16:51.119 --> 01:16:53.883
I won't. I'm just not going to do it.

01:16:54.089 --> 01:16:59.116
- You must abide by what is written.
- She loves me, Mr Jordan.

01:16:59.327 --> 01:17:02.785
You must abide by what is written.

01:18:01.284 --> 01:18:05.687
- Have you seen Mr Farnsworth?
- No, sir, I haven't.

01:18:05.856 --> 01:18:08.984
- Guess I'll just keep looking.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:12.863 --> 01:18:14.626
Joe, you in here?

01:18:21.036 --> 01:18:23.163
Are you in there, Mr Farnsworth?

01:18:41.322 --> 01:18:45.816
Listen, Your Highness, I'm telling
you what I told the mayor last week.

01:18:45.994 --> 01:18:48.826
By the end of the week,
I'll crack this case.

01:18:49.029 --> 01:18:52.294
Right. Another Arab.

01:18:52.466 --> 01:18:54.991
Son of a bitch Farnsworth
was into everything,

01:18:55.202 --> 01:18:57.670
and now he's vanished, disappeared.

01:18:57.805 --> 01:19:00.103
This is the craziest nut
I've ever dealt with.

01:19:00.274 --> 01:19:04.642
He wasn't fooling around.
If he was alive, he'd be here.

01:19:04.811 --> 01:19:09.180
You're asking me to believe Leo
Farnsworth asked you to marry him?

01:19:09.348 --> 01:19:11.748
Yes. He was going to get a divorce.

01:19:11.918 --> 01:19:15.251
When I left, he said he'd call me,
but something happened.

01:19:15.655 --> 01:19:18.317
- How do you know?
- Because he didn't call me.

01:19:18.691 --> 01:19:20.180
He would have kept his word.

01:19:22.327 --> 01:19:24.955
<i>With less than 24 hours
before the big game,</i>

01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:29.226
<i>the whereabouts of Leo Farnsworth
remains a mystery.</i>

01:19:29.401 --> 01:19:33.667
Farnsworth said his wife and
Tony Abbott were trying to kill him.

01:19:33.805 --> 01:19:38.241
Let me spring it on Abbott,
I can make him crack.

01:19:39.376 --> 01:19:42.277
Take Corkle to the Farnsworth house.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.840
The game!

01:19:49.386 --> 01:19:54.823
If you win this one, you're going
to be champions of the world.

01:19:55.425 --> 01:19:58.690
And they can take away
the money and the cheers.

01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:02.854
They can take away the good looks,

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:06.832
but nobody will ever
take that away from you.

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:14.866
Let's go.

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:23.345
Let me get this straight.

01:20:23.718 --> 01:20:27.154
You saw no specific changes
in Mr Farnsworth's behaviour?

01:20:27.321 --> 01:20:32.452
No, sir. A bit more talkative,
but other than that, normal.

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:35.227
And that's your opinion, too,
Mr Sisk?

01:20:35.396 --> 01:20:40.196
Yes. I did notice he seemed
to take a dislike to his hats,

01:20:40.367 --> 01:20:42.835
but it was never violent.

01:20:43.036 --> 01:20:44.731
Ask me whatever you want...?

01:20:44.905 --> 01:20:49.706
- Mr Corkle, please. Mr Everett?
- Yes?

01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:52.970
- You had cocoa with him every night.
- Yes.

01:20:53.146 --> 01:20:54.942
What did you talk about?

01:20:55.114 --> 01:20:57.480
Well, he'd say something like,

01:20:59.118 --> 01:21:02.087
"This cocoa is good, isn't it?"

01:21:02.254 --> 01:21:06.054
And I'd say, "Yes, it is."

01:21:06.225 --> 01:21:09.194
And then he'd say something like,

01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:12.090
"I wish the marshmallow
would last longer."

01:21:12.263 --> 01:21:16.359
And I'd say, "So do I."

01:21:17.168 --> 01:21:19.898
Sometimes he talked about cookies.

01:21:21.239 --> 01:21:25.198
Thank you, Mr Everett.
Did he mention disliking his hats?

01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:28.708
What the hell is this?
What does it matter?

01:21:28.845 --> 01:21:30.813
I'm following a line of questioning.

01:21:30.981 --> 01:21:35.077
Please. Mr Everett, did he ever
say anything to you about his hats?

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.951
- Never, sir.
- Thank you, Mr Everett.

01:21:51.767 --> 01:21:56.136
Mr Abbott, what did you discuss
the last time you saw him?

01:21:56.305 --> 01:21:58.829
He was considering buying Haiti.

01:21:59.007 --> 01:22:00.406
- The country?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:04.412 --> 01:22:07.870
Thank you, Mr Abbott.
Nothing about hats?

01:22:09.117 --> 01:22:11.984
- No.
- Thank you, Mr Abbott.

01:22:12.153 --> 01:22:15.644
Mrs Farnsworth, how was your
relationship with your husband?

01:22:15.856 --> 01:22:18.723
Very, very close. Very, very special.

01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:22.658
Miss Logan claims
he was getting a divorce

01:22:22.863 --> 01:22:25.730
and he asked her to marry him.

01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:28.333
I don't doubt that.

01:22:28.702 --> 01:22:31.829
My husband loved me
very much, but he was a man.

01:22:32.005 --> 01:22:35.839
He would say or do anything
to make a conquest,

01:22:36.009 --> 01:22:40.002
but it never touched our marriage.
That's what made it so special.

01:22:40.713 --> 01:22:42.010
They're pinning it on Betty.

01:22:42.181 --> 01:22:46.276
Miss Logan, I am sorry if I've said
anything that's hurt you.

01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.853
I don't know you well enough
for you to hurt me.

01:22:51.056 --> 01:22:55.686
- I hope you don't doubt my word.
- I don't, I'm sure you're lying.

01:22:57.095 --> 01:22:58.790
I assume if Mr Farnsworth told you

01:22:58.964 --> 01:23:01.364
about disliking his hats,
you'd let us know.

01:23:01.733 --> 01:23:07.193
You want to know about his hats?
He wouldn't wear socks with a suit!

01:23:07.405 --> 01:23:11.364
Every time he crossed his legs,
you could see his ankles were bare!

01:23:11.742 --> 01:23:15.644
That's when he stopped wearing hats.
They looked funny without socks!

01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:18.748
But he never told you
he disliked them.

01:23:18.915 --> 01:23:20.280
- What?
- His hats.

01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:23.647
Are you crazy? What kind
of questions are you asking?

01:23:23.853 --> 01:23:27.789
All right. Sit down.
Conway, turn that thing on.

01:23:27.957 --> 01:23:31.859
- Let him watch the game.
- Everything will be all right.

01:23:32.028 --> 01:23:35.394
We're getting a clearer picture
of Mr Farnsworth's patterns.

01:23:35.764 --> 01:23:38.824
There's a reason for everything.
There's got to be.

01:23:39.001 --> 01:23:40.901
<i>It's a demanding defence.</i>

01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:43.231
You don't need to worry about her.

01:23:44.239 --> 01:23:47.037
<i>Tom Jarrett, the Rams' quarterback,
back to pass.</i>

01:23:47.209 --> 01:23:52.202
<i>Looking, scrambling. He's in trouble.
And he's hit hard! Down he goes!</i>

01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.117
You're telling me

01:24:00.321 --> 01:24:03.984
that Mr Farnsworth
never carried any money

01:24:04.192 --> 01:24:08.651
or credit cards, right?
And no identification papers?

01:24:08.829 --> 01:24:11.161
- Right, sir. Yes.
- Then what we have here...

01:24:11.331 --> 01:24:15.893
<i>The score, 24-24. Overtime.</i>

01:24:16.103 --> 01:24:18.731
<i>The way he was hit,
Tom Jarrett is hurt.</i>

01:24:18.939 --> 01:24:23.272
<i>We can see
the Ram players are concerned,</i>

01:24:23.442 --> 01:24:27.640
<i>they're calling for the stretcher.
Jarrett has not moved.</i>

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:31.113
<i>It'll be a miracle, frankly,
and I hope he's well.</i>

01:24:31.283 --> 01:24:32.648
<i>It doesn't look good.</i>

01:24:32.785 --> 01:24:37.744
<i>They order Jerry Hodges to start
warming up on the sidelines.</i>

01:24:37.956 --> 01:24:40.117
<i>The Pittsburgh defence
has been brilliant.</i>

01:24:40.291 --> 01:24:42.156
<i>They've stopped the Rams...</i>

01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:45.159
The Haitian ambassador's here.

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:49.027
- Oh, yes. Thank you, Sisk.
- Tell him to wait.

01:24:50.902 --> 01:24:55.736
Who do you think you are?
You call this an investigation!

01:24:55.906 --> 01:24:58.807
- Now, Corkle!
- Your men standing around watching!

01:24:58.976 --> 01:25:02.639
How'd you do it this time?
Drug him like before?

01:25:05.949 --> 01:25:09.884
Lieutenant, I will not be spoken to
in this way in my house.

01:25:21.831 --> 01:25:23.128
Why did it have to be Jarrett?

01:25:23.332 --> 01:25:26.994
Because it's his time, Joe.
It's his destiny.

01:25:39.781 --> 01:25:43.045
- Look at the pupils!
- Bill! Get that ambulance!

01:26:06.039 --> 01:26:10.100
<i>- Jarret comes back into the game.
- Joe!</i>

01:26:13.879 --> 01:26:17.246
Oh, my God! It's his jacket!

01:26:17.649 --> 01:26:19.139
So it's you, Mr Abbott!

01:26:19.318 --> 01:26:21.912
I should have known
I couldn't trust you.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.918
- Here's your murderer!
- She did it!

01:26:25.090 --> 01:26:28.957
I'll confess she did it!
She's been planning it for years!

01:26:29.126 --> 01:26:33.893
- Corkle, where are you going?
- To the Coliseum.

01:26:34.065 --> 01:26:37.159
- I'm conducting an investigation.
- I'm going.

01:26:37.368 --> 01:26:40.667
Take this investigation
and shove it up your ass!

01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.885
<i>It's sudden death!
The crowd's delirious!</i>

01:27:15.905 --> 01:27:19.965
<i>Jarrett was sacked hard.
He's getting up. He's OK.</i>

01:27:53.139 --> 01:27:57.872
<i>A remarkable comeback by Jarrett.
The first team that scores, wins...</i>

01:28:51.327 --> 01:28:53.920
We're number one! We're number one!

01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:17.642
- Hi, Max.
- I am right, it is you, isn't it?

01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:25.318
I knew it! I knew it!

01:29:25.658 --> 01:29:30.322
I was watching the TV,
and I said, "That's him!"

01:29:30.663 --> 01:29:32.153
The Rams are champions!

01:29:32.332 --> 01:29:36.792
Here's the star, Tom Jarrett.
He led his team to victory.

01:29:36.970 --> 01:29:38.699
- How do you feel?
- Good.

01:29:38.872 --> 01:29:40.338
Describe your feelings.

01:29:40.706 --> 01:29:44.198
- World champions!
- I... I feel good.

01:29:46.412 --> 01:29:51.315
I have to go now, Joe. It's time.
I can't stay here any longer.

01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:55.745
- What do you mean?
- How does it feel to be Tom Jarrett?

01:29:55.953 --> 01:29:58.183
And when I've gone,
you won't remember me.

01:29:58.356 --> 01:30:02.622
You'll be Thomas Jarrett
with no memory of Joe Pendleton,

01:30:02.827 --> 01:30:06.194
or Leo Farnsworth
or anything that's happened.

01:30:06.731 --> 01:30:10.667
This is your destiny, Joe.
You're back on your own road now.

01:30:11.701 --> 01:30:15.831
- What do you mean, I won't remember?
- Goodbye, Joe.

01:30:16.006 --> 01:30:17.769
There's a lot of confusion.

01:30:17.974 --> 01:30:23.776
- Wait. I got to talk to you. Wait.
- Goodbye.

01:30:24.114 --> 01:30:26.412
Congratulations.
Here he is, Coach...

01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:28.774
You OK, Tom? You OK?

01:30:28.984 --> 01:30:33.045
Here's Lamar Crawford, the man
who caught one of those key passes.

01:30:34.256 --> 01:30:36.417
I'm just happy that we won.

01:30:53.808 --> 01:30:56.709
In September, I told you
the beginning of this season!

01:30:56.845 --> 01:31:01.110
Hey, Benny! Hey, Joe! Uh, Tom!

01:31:02.182 --> 01:31:05.379
- Hey, Doc. Did Tom leave?
- He's putting some ice on his eye.

01:31:05.719 --> 01:31:09.246
He'll be all right.
That's something about Farnsworth.

01:31:09.423 --> 01:31:12.915
- Poor son of a bitch.
- Yeah...

01:31:30.776 --> 01:31:34.734
Corkle. What are you doing,
closing up the joint?

01:31:34.913 --> 01:31:37.177
I didn't know you played that thing.

01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:41.811
- What are you talking about?
- Is that yours?

01:31:42.888 --> 01:31:44.822
What are you talking about?

01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:47.253
- What?
- You know what I mean.

01:31:47.424 --> 01:31:50.222
I mean,
what are you talking about, Joe?

01:31:55.866 --> 01:31:57.925
Am I missing something?

01:31:59.236 --> 01:32:03.763
Come on. What are you
trying to do to me, huh?

01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:08.741
I'm the guy that got hit in the head.
You sure you're all right, Corkle?

01:32:12.048 --> 01:32:15.040
Play something
for me on this thing, huh?

01:32:16.819 --> 01:32:19.616
That's the way it is
with champagne, huh?

01:32:19.788 --> 01:32:22.814
You just keep swallowing it
'cause it doesn't taste like anything,

01:32:22.991 --> 01:32:25.824
and all of a sudden, you're drunk.

01:32:34.735 --> 01:32:38.068
You going to the party, Corkle?
I'll give you a ride.

01:32:49.917 --> 01:32:52.646
A little fresh air wouldn't hurt.

01:32:54.988 --> 01:32:58.924
Look, just do me one favour.
Look at me.

01:33:01.127 --> 01:33:04.358
- Just look at me.
- What?

01:33:30.888 --> 01:33:33.982
You want to tell me
why you're calling me Joe?

01:33:38.962 --> 01:33:43.194
I guess it has something
to do with Joe Pendleton.

01:33:50.841 --> 01:33:54.207
I'm sorry. I didn't think, Corkle.

01:33:59.749 --> 01:34:01.080
You don't want a ride?

01:34:01.284 --> 01:34:05.015
No, I'll just...
I'm going to sit here for a minute.

01:34:08.891 --> 01:34:13.224
Hey, son, you...
You played a hell of a game.

01:34:13.395 --> 01:34:16.364
Thanks, Corkle. You all right?

01:34:53.733 --> 01:34:56.930
Excuse me.
Where might I find Max Corkle?

01:34:57.103 --> 01:35:00.765
- I believe he's here somewhere.
- He's in the locker room.

01:35:00.939 --> 01:35:03.066
Go back up the way you came,

01:35:03.275 --> 01:35:06.574
or go back and take a right
and then a left.

01:35:06.712 --> 01:35:13.174
- It's the second door on the right.
- I see. Thank you. Thank you.

01:35:21.759 --> 01:35:24.728
He's not expecting me.
Can I just walk in?

01:35:24.895 --> 01:35:27.329
Sure. He's the only guy in there.

01:35:34.137 --> 01:35:38.198
- Have we met?
- No. I don't think so.

01:35:38.375 --> 01:35:42.835
No, I guess we haven't. I'm sorry.

01:35:45.315 --> 01:35:50.616
- What did you think of the game?
- I didn't see it.

01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.388
Does your eye hurt?

01:35:53.756 --> 01:35:56.020
No, no, I...
Listen, my name's Tom Jarrett.

01:35:56.191 --> 01:36:00.719
- Hello. I'm Betty Logan.
- Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

01:36:02.196 --> 01:36:06.895
- You must play for the Rams.
- Yeah. You interested in football?

01:36:07.068 --> 01:36:10.265
- A friend of mine was.
- Was?

01:36:11.072 --> 01:36:12.300
Leo Farnsworth.

01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:20.576
- I'm sorry. Was he a close friend?
- Yes, he was very close.

01:36:22.315 --> 01:36:27.719
- That's too bad. I'm sorry.
- Have you put some ice on that?

01:36:30.357 --> 01:36:33.848
- What's that?
- They're just closing up the place.

01:36:34.026 --> 01:36:35.960
Here, give me your hand.

01:36:39.098 --> 01:36:40.827
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:36:48.073 --> 01:36:51.269
- What did you say?
- What?

01:36:53.945 --> 01:36:57.039
When you said
"There's nothing to be afraid of,"

01:36:57.248 --> 01:37:00.217
your voice sounded so familiar.

01:37:02.353 --> 01:37:05.549
Well, like I said,
I thought I knew you, too.

01:37:07.691 --> 01:37:10.854
People always think
they knew somebody before.

01:37:11.161 --> 01:37:13.595
Yes, they do.

01:37:15.666 --> 01:37:20.160
I was going to meet
a bunch of people, have a party...

01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:22.599
- I'm a little late.
- I'm sorry.

01:37:22.772 --> 01:37:24.103
No, no, no...

01:37:26.075 --> 01:37:30.876
All of a sudden,
I don't feel like going to a party,

01:37:31.214 --> 01:37:34.115
and I thought maybe if... I mean...

01:37:36.352 --> 01:37:38.911
You want to have a cup of coffee
or something?

01:37:46.661 --> 01:37:48.356
Well, I guess not.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.994
You're the quarterback.

01:37:57.304 --> 01:37:59.772
Yeah. How'd you know that?

01:38:04.044 --> 01:38:07.571
Yes, I'd love to have
a cup of coffee with you.

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.985
