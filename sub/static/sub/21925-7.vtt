[narrator]
Previously on  Star Trek: Discovery :

00:13.638 --> 00:16.182
[Lorca]
Discovery  is now the only Starfleet ship

00:16.307 --> 00:18.393
with a displacement-activated
spore hub drive.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.979
[gasping, then laughing]

00:21.062 --> 00:23.648
He injected himself
with the tardigrade DNA compound.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.444
-[Tyler] Here.
-[Lorca] What's your name?

00:27.527 --> 00:28.528
Lieutenant Ash Tyler.

00:28.611 --> 00:29.696
[insect skittering]

00:29.779 --> 00:33.491
You'd take food outta the mouths of
the men standing between you and death?

00:34.075 --> 00:35.201
Damn right I would.

00:36.828 --> 00:37.704
[neck cracks]

00:40.123 --> 00:41.750
Now shall we proceed to our raider?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.835
[grunts] No.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.296
[shouting and grunting]

00:48.006 --> 00:49.591
[Lorca] Get up, soldier. Get up.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.593
I'm slowing you down, sir. Go.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.722
[theme music playing]

02:27.647 --> 02:30.233
[Burnham]  Personal log,
Specialist Michael Burnham.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.485
Stardate 2136.8.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.572
Despite my fears to the contrary,

02:35.655 --> 02:38.616
I seem to have found my place
on this  Discovery.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.536
An air of routine has descended
upon the ship,

02:41.619 --> 02:43.163
and even I am a part of it.

02:43.621 --> 02:44.706
I've made friends.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.458
Well, one, at least.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.794
I take comfort in my work.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.714
This ship has quickly become
the most important weapon

02:52.797 --> 02:56.259
in the Federation's arsenal
in our war against the Klingons.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.970
And because of her,
the tide has turned.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.599
Because of us, we are winning.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.852
Lieutenant Stamets' ability
to pilot the ship's spore drive

03:05.935 --> 03:07.979
has given him access
not just to all of space,

03:08.062 --> 03:10.899
but to unseen parts of his personality,
as well.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.651
As we perform our daily responsibilities,

03:13.735 --> 03:15.904
I confess I find some members
of my fellow crew

03:15.987 --> 03:17.780
more interesting than others.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.409
Lieutenant Tyler has suffered so much,

03:21.492 --> 03:24.704
and still maintains such
dignity and kindness.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.790
I find him... intriguing.

03:29.208 --> 03:33.421
But I fear my personal history interferes
with my ability to forge relationships.

03:33.838 --> 03:37.550
I am among the others, but also apart.

03:38.593 --> 03:42.096
I wish sorely to step out of my
comfort zone, yet don't know how.

03:42.555 --> 03:46.476
But tonight, I will face
one of my greatest challenges so far.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.021
Tonight, we are having a party.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.483
[Wyclef Jean's "We Trying to Stay Alive"
playing over speakers]

03:56.778 --> 03:58.863
One, two, three, go.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.116
[all cheering]

04:02.200 --> 04:03.534
[indistinct chatter]

04:05.036 --> 04:07.163
[people chanting] Go, Tilly! Go, Tilly!

04:07.247 --> 04:09.165
Go, Tilly! Go, Tilly!

04:11.542 --> 04:13.962
-[music stops]
-[woman] Where's the music?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.422
-[music resumes]
-[all cheering]

04:17.090 --> 04:18.049
What's your deal?

04:18.549 --> 04:20.551
Starships have power redundant relays.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.806
-There shouldn't be any flickering.
-No, not work. I'm talking about him.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.352
You guys have been on two dates.
What's going on? I want details.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.855
I helped him calibrate pulse scope rifles
in the armory,

04:33.022 --> 04:36.150
and we ate lunch together
because it was the end of our shift.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.529
Hey, listen, you gotta give him a sign
that you're interested.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.864
Otherwise, you're gonna lose your shot.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.368
Duly noted, when I'm actually on a date,
which these were not.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.245
Well, how--? How do you see him?

04:47.370 --> 04:50.915
How does he stack up,
compared to your old boyfriends?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.543
How does he compare to yours?

04:53.626 --> 04:56.587
Well, I used to exclusively
go for soldiers,

04:56.713 --> 04:59.674
but I'm kind of going through, like,
a musician phase right now.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.175
[Tyler] Everyone, hey.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.927
We're all lucky to be here tonight,

05:03.052 --> 05:05.346
surrounded by our brothers
and sisters-in-arms.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.432
Laughing. Dancing.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.268
But let's not forget the sacrifices
that have been made

05:10.393 --> 05:12.812
-by those who still serve alongside us...
-[man] Here, here!

05:12.937 --> 05:16.816
...and by those who have given their lives
so we can continue the fight.

05:16.899 --> 05:20.028
-[all applauding]
-To the 10,000 souls who are gone,

05:20.111 --> 05:22.572
-but will never be forgotten.
-[man] Never! Yes!

05:22.697 --> 05:24.449
[all cheering]

05:27.910 --> 05:29.912
My soldier thing is back.

05:31.039 --> 05:31.873
[Tyler] Burnham.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.585
-Hey, Tilly. What are you up to?
-I'm leaving. [chuckles]

05:35.668 --> 05:36.878
You guys have fun.

05:38.796 --> 05:39.714
Your friend's subtle.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.841
-Inappropriately so.
-[comm beeps]

05:41.924 --> 05:44.510
[man]  Science Specialist Burnham
and Lieutenant Tyler,

05:44.594 --> 05:46.304
please report to the bridge.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.600
Look at that.
Saved from the horrors of small talk.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.315
Wait. No, I--

05:58.274 --> 05:59.108
To be clear,

05:59.609 --> 06:01.194
I wasn't attempting to be rude.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.238
It's just that my experience
with parties is limited.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.532
-Easy, I get it.
-[man] Left, please.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.578
Vulcans don't party? The  Shenzhou?
You served for seven years.

06:10.661 --> 06:13.289
Due to my rank,
interpersonal fraternization was...

06:13.873 --> 06:14.791
not appropriate.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.586
Not really an excuse anymore.
So, why are you still hiding in corners?

06:19.087 --> 06:19.921
Oh!

06:22.882 --> 06:23.966
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.384
I'm sorry, Dr. Culber.

06:25.468 --> 06:30.723
Why would you apologize
for a random act of physical interaction?

06:31.390 --> 06:36.104
These are the moments that make life
so gloriously unpredictable.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.690
You're a very tall man.

06:40.858 --> 06:44.362
I believe you've met Lieutenant Tyler.
He's our new chief of security.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.698
May I say,
you are astonishingly grounded

06:47.782 --> 06:50.326
for having endured
seven months of torture.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.370
I deeply apologize for my partner.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.288
Lately, he's been, um...

06:55.623 --> 06:57.375
-different.
-[Stamets] Speaking of different,

06:58.209 --> 07:02.338
look at this cybernetic augment
that my resident genius here built for me.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.258
We're trying to make his connection
to the spore drive more comfortable.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.052
You're always looking out for me.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.389
By the way,
what's the deal with you two?

07:12.390 --> 07:13.433
There is no deal.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.269
Specialist Burnham would hate
to be inappropriate.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.648
-Coming, Burnham?
-What did he mean by that?

07:20.773 --> 07:24.902
[man on comm]  Attention officer trainees,
report to your immediate supervisors.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.571
-What did you mean by that?
-Okay.

07:30.324 --> 07:33.786
Captain, the unidentified signal
I monitored is directly ahead.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.413
Yellow alert, Mr. Saru.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.622
Shields up.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.833
-Phasers to standby.
-Copy that. Topping up.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.335
Scanners identify the object
as biological.

07:41.419 --> 07:45.339
Xenologic classification: gormagander.
Its health appears to be compromised.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.217
Cancel the yellow alert, Mr. Saru.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.554
Thought those had been hunted
to extinction.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.848
Hunting isn't the cause
of its reduced numbers.

07:53.931 --> 07:57.894
It's primarily due
to their mating practices or lack thereof.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.022
They spend their lives feeding
on alpha particles in solar winds.

08:01.814 --> 08:05.151
They're often so consumed by this task
that they ignore all other instincts.

08:05.818 --> 08:06.736
Including reproduction.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.113
That's as depressing a trait
as I've ever heard.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.364
Helmsman, plot a course.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.825
The gormagander is
on the endangered species list.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.995
Protocol requires transfer
to a xenologic facility.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.540
Then have at it.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.211
Hear we've got a lonely gormagander
beaming in.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.671
Lost cub or old widow?

08:25.922 --> 08:28.132
No matter what she is,
she is all alone.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.470
[man 1] We've got a lock
on the creature. Ready to transport.

08:32.553 --> 08:33.721
Energizing.

08:37.391 --> 08:40.061
[gormagander groaning]

08:44.273 --> 08:45.608
All right, sweet girl.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.529
Let's see if we can't figure out
what's got you down.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.156
[scanner whirring]

08:52.240 --> 08:53.324
[man 2] Wait a minute.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.952
I'm detecting abnormal readings
inside the creature.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.538
[gormagander groaning]

09:03.834 --> 09:05.711
-[grunts]
-[woman shouts indistinctly]

09:06.212 --> 09:07.630
[man] Don't! Don't shoot!

09:11.008 --> 09:12.343
[man] Call the bridge!

09:17.306 --> 09:18.307
Burnham to the bridge.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.726
Intruder alert.
Shots fired. Need assistance.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.396
-Intruder's on Deck 6, sir.
-I want him locked down.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.605
[alarm wailing]

09:24.689 --> 09:26.065
-Status on Burnham?
-Unharmed.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.527
-She reports four confirmed fatalities.
-Tell her not to engage the hostile.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.821
[woman grunts on viewer]

09:32.196 --> 09:33.531
We have him trapped, sir.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.035
Whoever you are, drop your weapons.
This ends now.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.161
[intruder laughing]

09:40.955 --> 09:43.124
Did you miss me
as much as I missed you?

09:43.249 --> 09:44.333
Mudd.

09:45.209 --> 09:48.546
Did you really think that you could
leave me to rot in a Klingon prison

09:48.671 --> 09:50.423
and not suffer any repercussions?

09:51.007 --> 09:54.719
As soon as I find out
what's so special about your ship,

09:55.386 --> 09:58.514
I'm gonna sell it to the Klingons.
Do you hear me, Captain?

09:58.723 --> 10:02.226
I'm going to sell your ship
to your mortal enemy.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.477
And in so doing,

10:03.686 --> 10:08.357
destroy any chance your Federation has
of winning this war.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.736
When you left me behind
with the Klingons,

10:11.861 --> 10:15.323
you robbed me of my dear,
sweet Stella,

10:15.406 --> 10:18.075
the only woman I have ever loved.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.952
And I will have my revenge.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.457
Also, I'm gonna kill you
as many times as possible.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.084
I don't see this ending
with you taking my ship.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.336
Not this time.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.963
But I have all the data I need
for the next, so...

10:31.088 --> 10:32.423
I will see you later.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.967
Or, rather... earlier.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.637
[device charging]

10:40.097 --> 10:42.516
-Mr. Saru.
-Sensors read anicium and yurium

10:43.643 --> 10:44.769

10:47.104 --> 10:48.606
[Tyler] Five. Four.

10:49.106 --> 10:49.982
Now three.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.776
We can't contain it, Captain.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.364
[shouting]

10:59.283 --> 11:03.329
[Wyclef Jean's "We Trying to Stay Alive"
playing over speakers]

11:05.164 --> 11:08.334
To the 10,000 souls who are gone,
but will never be forgotten.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.627
[all] Never.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.253
[all cheering]

11:12.463 --> 11:14.757
Think my soldier thing is back.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.927
Burnham. Hey, Tilly. What are you up to?

11:18.052 --> 11:19.553
I'm leaving. [chuckling]

11:19.637 --> 11:20.471
Have fun.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.766
-Your friend's subtle.
-Inappropriately so.

[man over comm]
Science Specialist Burnham and--

11:27.186 --> 11:30.064
To be clear,
I wasn't attempting to be rude.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.358
My experience with parties is limited.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.944
-Easy, Burnham, I get it.
-[man] Left, please.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.447
[Tyler] So Vulcans don't party.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.783
What about the  Shenzhou?
Served for what, seven years?

11:40.866 --> 11:43.452
Yes, but interpersonal fraternization
was inappropriate.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.830
Not really an excuse anymore.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.833
So, why are you still hiding in corners?

11:49.375 --> 11:53.129
There aren't always simple answers
to those kinds of questions.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.382
And sometimes there are.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.178
-Oh. Tyler! Tyler, wait!
-Stamets?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.431
Burnham. Both of you.
You need to listen to me.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.515
There isn't any time.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.436
-Or, rather, there is time. Too much time.
-Stamets, slow down.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.480
I can't slow down.
Don't you see what's happening?

12:11.605 --> 12:12.940
We have been here before.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.233
All of us.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.986
I cannot be the only person
who recognizes this.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.737
Paul. I'm very sorry.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.158
-You're ranting.
-What I need is for all of you

12:22.241 --> 12:24.785
placid people to finally start listening.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.162
Wait, wait. Um...

12:26.871 --> 12:30.332
It all starts with a gormagander, okay?
A gormagander.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.670
-What's a gormagander?
-It's a space whale.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.755
Well, that explains it.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.301
-[computer]  Yellow alert.
-[alarm wailing]

12:40.384 --> 12:42.386
-Yellow alert.
-Nice of you two to show up.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.722
Mr. Saru,
what's hiding from us out there?

12:45.014 --> 12:48.851
The object is not an enemy ship, sir.
It is an organic life form.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.644
A gormagander.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.818
Oh, for crying out loud.
All right, cancel the yellow alert.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.904
Helm, find some way to get around it.

13:00.529 --> 13:05.242
But, sir, scans show the gormagander's
bio-readings to be highly unstable.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.162
Now, according to regulations,
we are required to transfer it--

13:08.245 --> 13:10.164
-Belay that order.
-I don't advise that, Captain.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.292
The Endangered Species Act
is quite clear.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.338
Ignoring our duties would put us
in violation of established laws

13:17.463 --> 13:20.049
and subject our captain to court-martial.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.969
Let's beam this into the shuttle bay
and drop it off at the nearest sanctuary.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.805
I'd like to run point on this, sir.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.431
As science specialist,

13:27.515 --> 13:29.683
I'm the most qualified
to handle this creature.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.602
I don't give a damn. I just want it done.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.105
I request security oversight
of the operation, Captain.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.399
I still don't give a damn. Go.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.949
How could Lieutenant Stamets know
we were gonna run into a gormagander?

13:45.032 --> 13:48.202
There have only been 57 cases
of near misses with starships

13:48.285 --> 13:50.871
in the last ten years.
The odds are almost incalculable.

13:50.955 --> 13:54.041
-Gotta be a prize for that kind of dumb.
-I hear we've got a lonely gormagander

13:54.124 --> 13:56.043
-beaming in.
-[sighs] Yeah.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.213
Activate transporter.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.216

-You thinking this whale is armed?

14:10.182 --> 14:13.352
[gormagander groaning]

14:21.986 --> 14:24.572
Medical readings are abnormal,
but nothing else is unusual.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.365
Gonna get closer readings.

[tricorder whirring]

14:31.662 --> 14:34.123
[gormagander groaning]

14:41.088 --> 14:41.964
You got something?

14:42.882 --> 14:43.716
Faint.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.426
An energy pattern.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.387
Almost like a transporter beam.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.390
-[alarm wailing]
-[computer]  Black alert.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.310
- Black alert.
-Why are we preparing to jump?

14:57.062 --> 14:59.857
-[computer]  Spore drive activated.
-I didn't order a spore jump.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.734
I did not activate it, sir.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.028
Computer, show me engineering.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.237
[computer]  Denied.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.616
Tyler, get to engineering.

15:08.699 --> 15:09.575
Go, go, go!

15:11.869 --> 15:14.246
Locked from the inside.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.380
Welcome, kiddies.
Make yourselves at home.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.633
-I have.
-How did you get out of that prison?

15:27.092 --> 15:29.053
[Mudd] Remember my
multi-legged friend Stuart?

15:29.136 --> 15:31.931
Well, we performed a feat of magic

15:32.056 --> 15:35.017
that would make the most accomplished
escape artist blush.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.186
Alas, once free, he went his own way.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.395
Bugs, no loyalty.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.148
-Tyler, you know this man?
-He was my cellmate.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.777
Back away. Put your hands in the air.
I won't ask you again, Mudd.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.570
Actually, you will.

15:47.154 --> 15:47.988
But before then,

15:48.489 --> 15:50.950
would you please tell me how
to work these controls?

15:51.033 --> 15:55.663
Now, I understand that the drive system
is what's special about this ship.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.540
-Back away or we'll fire.
-But for the life of me I can't...

16:01.418 --> 16:03.253
figure out what these contraptions do.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.048
-Or what they connect to.
-[computer]  Critical drive overload

16:06.131 --> 16:08.550
- in 60 seconds.
-Can we jump to where you tell me how

16:08.634 --> 16:12.471
to make these systems operational?
I've got some Klingons on the hook.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.014
Might wanna hurry.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.518
We're getting close to that point where,
you know... [mimics explosion]

16:17.601 --> 16:21.021
-Computer, beam intruder to the brig.
-I've created a field to protect me.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.816
You think I would forget
to take control of the computer?

16:23.899 --> 16:26.151
Warning: Critical drive overload imminent.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.320
-You are mad.
-[Mudd] No.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.655
I'm Mudd.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.451
Now will one of you tell me how
to work this damn system?!

16:34.576 --> 16:35.786
[phaser fires]

16:39.164 --> 16:42.167
As days go, this is a weird one.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.509
Stamets, the drive.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.844
I know. Believe me.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.430
[computer]
Critical drive overload in 20 seconds.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.141
We've been through all this before. Um...

16:58.058 --> 17:00.185
Multiple times, actually.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.771
And I hate to tell you,

17:02.855 --> 17:07.401
but I have yet to find a way where
it ends with a win for the home team.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.945
Warning: Drive overload critical.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.655
[rapid electronic beeping]

17:13.240 --> 17:14.658
I'll see you again soon.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.076
Stamets, wait!

[Wyclef Jean's "We Trying to Stay Alive"

17:23.333 --> 17:25.127
I was gonna ask if you wanted to dance.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.420
[comm beeps]

17:26.503 --> 17:28.964
[man]  Science Specialist Burnham
and Lieutenant Tyler,

17:29.048 --> 17:32.885
-please report to the bridge.
-[sighs] Saved by the bell.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.011
Excuse me.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.179
Excuse me.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.517
-Hey, where's Burnham?
-I don't know.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.770
The gormagander is
on the endangered species list.

17:45.939 --> 17:46.940
Have at it.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.989
Burnham, don't talk. Just listen.
The ship is in danger.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.949
We are caught in a temporal loop.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.577
We are repeating the same
30 odd minutes over and over again.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.370
The ship can be destroyed.
We can be killed.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.248
But as long as the 30 minute window
doesn't expire, everything starts over.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.418
And every second you doubt me
brings us all closer to death.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.377
Do you understand?

18:09.254 --> 18:10.839
I think we need to get you to sick bay.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.884
-These might be side effects--
-Exposure to alien DNA.

18:13.967 --> 18:17.054
[both] Possible we haven't taken into
consideration the cognitive variances--

18:17.137 --> 18:19.515
Yes, yes, yes.
Please, stop talking. Come with me.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.808
I'll explain everything.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.559
Is the fish safely onboard yet?

18:22.684 --> 18:25.020
Technically, it's not a fish, it's--

18:26.230 --> 18:28.398
-Shuttle bay reports five by five.
-Good.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.484
Captain, message from Dr. Culber.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.362
He's requesting you in sick bay.
It's regarding Lieutenant Stamets.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.906
-It's urgent.
-Sick bay. Direct.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.787
-[sighs]
-[computer]  Destination canceled.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.836
-Heavy.
-Mudd?

18:49.962 --> 18:50.879
Computer, red alert.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.298
Override, my dear computer. Come on.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.259
The hell are you doing on my ship?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.594
You ask me that question
every single time.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.887
You know that, don't you?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.764
-No, of course you don't.
-What?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.309
Move!

19:05.310 --> 19:08.897
I really can't take it from the top
for you all over again, Lorca.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.650
The message from the doctor
was not real.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.569
I just wanted some alone time with you.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.946
There's an area of the ship
I can't access.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.490
Hoping you're hiding your secrets
to the spore drive inside.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.367
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.995
But if you think I'm gonna help you
in any way at all,

19:23.370 --> 19:25.038
then you're crazier than I remember.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.126
There are so many ways to blow up
this ship. It's almost a design flaw.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.754
-[phaser powering up]
-Computer, access self-destruct program.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.424
-[computer]  Accessed.
-Ball's in your court, Captain.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.554
Mudd is using some kind of technology
that allows him

19:40.637 --> 19:43.056
to repeat the same 30 minutes
over and over.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.351
He's trying to get the drive running
to sell the ship to the Klingons.

19:46.476 --> 19:49.313
Well, how are you capable
of existing outside of the time loop?

19:49.396 --> 19:51.773
Well, the tardigrade
is a multidimensional creature,

19:51.899 --> 19:54.651
so, it must be a side effect
of combining its DNA with mine.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.862
-Yes, so, you remember everything.
-Yes.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.741
And it's getting really hard
to keep it straight.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.327
I can't stop Mudd alone, Burnham.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.537
And sooner or later,
he's going to figure out

20:05.621 --> 20:08.415
there's a piece missing
from the spore drive.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.375
It's me.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.004
How is Mudd creating a time loop?

20:14.338 --> 20:18.592
I don't know. I'm hoping Tyler might,
because they shared a cell together.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.053
Tyler mentioned it
right before I shot Mudd.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.390
Anyway, I need you to talk to Tyler.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.811
We're almost out of time in this loop.

20:30.812 --> 20:31.897
Tell me a secret.

20:32.773 --> 20:36.360
Something that will immediately
prove to you we've had this conversation.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.695
Something you've never admitted to anyone.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.492
I promise, it'll be safe with me.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.378
[inaudible whispering]

21:00.968 --> 21:01.802
I'm sorry.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.306
Where is Mudd now?

21:07.349 --> 21:10.143
Now is usually around the time
he kills the captain.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.152
Okay. [chuckles]

21:19.569 --> 21:22.239
Ooh, I love what
you've done with the place, Gabe.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.410
There's nothing here for you, Mudd.
This is my own private research area.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.955
Uh-huh. Why didn't you tell me
that you had so many wonderful toys?

21:30.580 --> 21:31.415
Ooh.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.834
Wonder what this does.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.503
I'm thinking it might melt brains.
Does it melt brains?

21:36.628 --> 21:39.589
Kill a Starfleet captain,
they lock you up forever.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.549
You know that.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.512
Know how many times I've had the pleasure
of taking your life, Lorca?

21:48.557 --> 21:50.142
[phaser powering up]

22:07.200 --> 22:08.410
[yelling]

22:22.215 --> 22:24.718
Fifty-three. But who's counting?

22:24.801 --> 22:26.511
-And it never gets old.
-[watch beeps]

22:27.054 --> 22:30.057
Oh, drat. We're almost out of time.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.351
I'll figure out how that little motor
of yours works sooner or later.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.395
I've got all the time in the world.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.441
And in the meanwhile,
we still don't know what this does.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.068
Let's find out.

-There shouldn't--
-I spotted the hottest guy over there,

22:57.417 --> 22:59.211
and apparently, he's in a band.

-Have fun.
-[Tilly] Okay.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.758
-I wouldn't take you for this event.
-You've never been in love.

-Why would you say that?
-I need your help.

You told me that information to prove
to you that what I'm saying is true.

We've been caught
in a 30-minute time loop,

and I'm the only one who realizes it.
I have witnessed you and Lorca

23:19.773 --> 23:23.485
and Tyler die at the hands
of a criminal named Harry Mudd,

23:23.610 --> 23:26.905

and find out if he has any information
on Mudd that will help us stop him.

-But what if he won't talk to me, either?
-Oh, he will.

24:16.496 --> 24:19.499
Yeah, you should've gone with him
to the bridge.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.209
If what you say is true,

24:21.293 --> 24:24.754

25:18.058 --> 25:21.728
Well, I told him to stifle it,

25:33.448 --> 25:34.783
why would he do that?

25:35.533 --> 25:37.994
I told him how I really felt.

And he did the same.

[chuckles]

38:20.965 --> 38:22.800
-Don't try and con a con man.
-[Lorca] I'm not.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.969
I'm negotiating with a businessman.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.679
My offer's simple.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.682
The lives of my crew in exchange for...

38:31.600 --> 38:33.811
Burnham, the ship, and Stamets.

38:33.936 --> 38:36.605
Why would a Federation captain do that?

38:36.731 --> 38:41.277
I will not have a repeat of the  Buran.

38:41.861 --> 38:45.865
We will do whatever
our new owners require,

38:46.532 --> 38:49.660
if I have your word that
you will spare the ship's complement.

38:53.414 --> 38:54.665
Your word, Mudd.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.347
Well, I've never been one
to look a gift captain in the mouth.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.724
[chuckles] You have my word.

39:11.807 --> 39:13.100
Excellent. Excellent, good.

39:13.225 --> 39:14.727
-Computer.
-[computer]  Working.

39:15.311 --> 39:18.064
Send our coordinates
to the awaiting Klingon vessel,

39:18.147 --> 39:19.774
courtesy of Harry Mudd.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.525
Sending, Captain Mudd.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.361
Now... [clears throat]

39:23.736 --> 39:25.321
...this is your last chance to stop me.

39:25.905 --> 39:29.033
Only got about 30 seconds
until we rejoin the time stream,

39:29.116 --> 39:30.868
and there is no turning back.

39:30.951 --> 39:33.788
[computer]
Captain, incoming warp signature detected.

39:33.913 --> 39:37.041
I never thought I'd be so happy
to see those pointy-headed bastards.

39:39.335 --> 39:45.758
Oh! Look at this.
Five, four, three, two, one.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.178
[computer]  Captain Mudd,

39:49.303 --> 39:51.555
- we are being hailed by the Klingons.
-Excellent.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.684
-Welcome our guests onboard.
- Acknowledged. Two to beam aboard.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.770
Energize once I reach
the transporter room.

39:57.895 --> 40:00.481
Come along. Meet your new masters.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.650
Ah-ah-ah. Not you, old man.

40:03.484 --> 40:07.363
Lorca, I'm gonna really miss killing you.
[chuckles]

40:07.488 --> 40:09.198
Adieu, mon capitaine.

40:10.658 --> 40:13.119
-You seem very happy.
-Listen, petunia,

40:13.244 --> 40:16.539
I've been screwed over since the day
I was born. I deserve this.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.667
So, it wasn't about Stella after all?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.419
It was always only about you.

40:22.336 --> 40:26.006
You keep talking about how you lost her
because of the war,

40:26.090 --> 40:29.051
but her father's an arms dealer
who's made a fortune off it.

40:29.635 --> 40:32.263
Finding either of them
shouldn't be that difficult,

40:32.888 --> 40:36.058
-unless you don't want to.
-I never told you about Baron Grimes.

40:36.142 --> 40:39.270
No, but  Discovery's  archives
are non-critical systems.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.981
You probably should've disarmed them,
as well.

40:42.106 --> 40:45.317
Now you don't have your time crystal,
you can't learn from this mistake.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.028
And it turns out that
Stella's been looking for you.

40:48.154 --> 40:51.198
So much so
that her father put out a reward.

40:51.323 --> 40:53.784
-You haven't been running to Stella.
-You've been running from her.

40:55.411 --> 40:58.038
Skipped out on the baron's daughter
with her dowry.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.208
Stella was too tempting a mark
for you to resist.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.377
But ripping off her father
was a risky move.

41:03.502 --> 41:06.046
[Burnham] No wonder you needed
the deal with the Klingons so badly.

41:06.714 --> 41:07.756
You had to disappear.

41:07.882 --> 41:11.760
And you almost pulled it off,
except for me,

41:12.094 --> 41:15.639
'cause I exist outside
the normal time stream.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.808
You think you're so smart.

41:18.184 --> 41:21.770
Have you forgotten the Klingons are
beaming their way here as we speak?

41:22.938 --> 41:25.941
Hmm? You can forget about that deal
I made with Lorca.

41:26.525 --> 41:30.571
You geniuses have just condemned
your crewmates to a life of servitude.

41:30.654 --> 41:33.199
Harry, the Klingons aren't coming.

41:33.949 --> 41:35.618
I rewired the captain's chair.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.828
[Burnham] Another non-critical system.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.289
You didn't send coordinates
to your buyers.

41:40.414 --> 41:41.832
You sent them to Stella...

41:42.833 --> 41:43.792
and her daddy.

41:46.879 --> 41:48.881
Turns out you can con a con man.

41:50.674 --> 41:51.509
[Tyler] Let's go.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.970
Computer, cancel transporter now.

41:55.095 --> 41:56.013
[computer]  Denied.

41:58.724 --> 41:59.850
Harcourt.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.853
Where have you been?

42:02.937 --> 42:07.525
-I have been so worried about you.
-[both] Mmm...

42:07.900 --> 42:12.071
Oh. It's been, oh, such a tumultuous year.
[chuckles]

42:12.154 --> 42:13.906
I can't even begin to explain.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.158
Try.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.660
Yes. Yes.

42:17.785 --> 42:19.286
Of course.

42:19.411 --> 42:21.038
You know how much you meant to me.

42:21.163 --> 42:21.997
Mean.

42:22.873 --> 42:24.416
How much you mean to me.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.001
But to be brutally honest,

42:26.168 --> 42:29.129
I have led a life marred by,
oh, how shall we say...

42:29.630 --> 42:31.257
poor choices, debt.

42:31.674 --> 42:33.884
All kinds of blemishes to my reputation.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.928
And I couldn't enter into union with you

42:36.053 --> 42:39.390
with those pocks upon my character,
so, I set out to eliminate them.

42:39.974 --> 42:43.686
But, alas, my plan was led astray.

42:44.645 --> 42:48.232
Harry, I have always known who you are.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.485
And I've never cared.

42:52.027 --> 42:54.780
We could've faced those problems together,
and...

42:55.739 --> 42:57.783
Daddy would've taken care
of everything else.

42:58.617 --> 43:02.246
Consider it a consolidation of your debt
under one lender.

43:03.205 --> 43:08.252
I would do anything for my daughter,
and she, for better or worse,

43:08.836 --> 43:10.588
has taken to you, Mudd.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.674
And now, thanks to the action
of these officers,

43:14.174 --> 43:17.052
you can finally make
an honest woman of Stella.

43:17.136 --> 43:21.599
As for Starfleet, I don't intend
to be in debt to your organization.

43:22.558 --> 43:23.559
How do I repay you?

43:24.518 --> 43:28.564
Just make sure Mr. Mudd spends the rest
of his days at your daughter's side,

43:28.689 --> 43:30.399
and out of Starfleet's way.

43:30.524 --> 43:31.692
Consider it done.

43:33.777 --> 43:36.655
Come here, Harcourt, you naughty boy.

43:51.962 --> 43:53.589
[indistinct chatter]

43:58.636 --> 44:00.387
-Hey.
-Hey.

44:02.348 --> 44:05.184
Stamets told me in a previous timeline,
that we, um...

44:07.353 --> 44:08.187
danced.

44:09.271 --> 44:10.105
Yeah.

44:10.814 --> 44:12.650
Yeah, he mentioned that to me, too.

44:16.445 --> 44:17.613
He said I liked it.

44:20.991 --> 44:21.867
I can't imagine.

44:23.535 --> 44:24.370
Why?

44:25.663 --> 44:27.039
I'm a really good dancer.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.710
-I didn't mean--
-Easy, Burnham.

44:33.712 --> 44:34.546
I get it.

44:37.424 --> 44:38.509
[door opens]

44:49.019 --> 44:50.187
What I'm feeling...

44:51.897 --> 44:53.065
is complicated...

44:53.982 --> 44:54.817
and strange.

44:57.569 --> 44:58.404
It's okay.

44:59.363 --> 45:00.531
I'm not going anywhere.

45:08.914 --> 45:09.957
What is it?

45:11.834 --> 45:13.961
I'm just sad we missed our first kiss.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.131
[door opens]

45:19.299 --> 45:20.426
[Burnham]  Personal log.

45:20.551 --> 45:23.053
Just as repetition reinforces repetition,

45:23.762 --> 45:25.764
change begets change.

45:27.558 --> 45:31.228
I guess the truth is,
we never really know what's coming.

45:31.770 --> 45:34.481
Sometimes, the only way to find out
where you fit in

45:35.149 --> 45:37.234
is to step out of the routine.

45:38.569 --> 45:41.029
Because sometimes
where you really belong

45:41.613 --> 45:44.158
was waiting right around the corner
all along.

45:51.039 --> 45:53.834
[theme music playing]
