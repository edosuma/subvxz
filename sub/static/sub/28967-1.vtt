01:20.099 --> 01:23.102
Nah, I ain't gonna need
no backup on this one.

01:50.429 --> 01:52.529
Move and that next bullet
is going in your ass.

01:52.531 --> 01:53.497
You've got the right
to remain silent,

01:53.499 --> 01:54.933
anything you say can and will...

01:54.935 --> 01:56.166
I didn't even
fuckin' do nothin'.

01:56.168 --> 01:57.536
Who the fuck are you?

01:59.605 --> 02:00.439
Who am I?

02:01.140 --> 02:03.008
I'm detective Elijah Wilkins,

02:03.010 --> 02:04.174
and I got everything needed

02:04.176 --> 02:05.977
to take you in,
Spencer Williams.

02:05.979 --> 02:07.177
My names Spank, bitch.

02:07.179 --> 02:09.114
Yeah,
whatever, get up.

02:09.116 --> 02:09.948
You can't come
in here causing...

02:09.949 --> 02:11.116
Hey, shut up, Elijah,

02:11.118 --> 02:12.383
because I'm doing you
a favor, all right?

02:22.461 --> 02:23.794
Freeze,
I said freeze.

02:52.792 --> 02:53.490
Stop.

03:38.871 --> 03:40.204
Got your ass.

03:46.478 --> 03:48.145
So you killin' folk,

03:48.147 --> 03:49.412
you sellin' dope,

03:49.414 --> 03:51.514
and you attacked an officer.

03:51.516 --> 03:53.083
Oh yeah, I'm about to
make sure the booty boys

03:53.085 --> 03:55.052
have a good time
with you in prison.

03:55.054 --> 03:55.888
Let's go.

04:08.433 --> 04:10.833
Do you wanna explain to me

04:10.835 --> 04:13.137
why I just got off the phone
with an angry bartender

04:13.139 --> 04:15.705
saying that a police
officer opened fire

04:15.707 --> 04:18.375
in his bar around
unarmed civilians?

04:19.476 --> 04:20.209
Lieutenant Roberts,
why do you always keep it

04:20.212 --> 04:21.178
so dark in here?

04:21.180 --> 04:22.112
'Cause this is my office,

04:22.113 --> 04:24.981
and it's my rules so shut up.

04:24.983 --> 04:27.350
What happened to the backup
that I called for you?

04:27.352 --> 04:29.285
- What, man, I don't...
- Shut up, okay?

04:29.287 --> 04:31.556
That was rhetorical,
I'm not done talking.

04:32.524 --> 04:35.725
I don't, I don't get
it, I don't get it.

04:35.727 --> 04:38.060
You have a background
in criminal justice,

04:38.062 --> 04:40.096
you have a family,
you're actually

04:40.098 --> 04:41.798
a halfway decent detective,

04:41.800 --> 04:46.270
but you're selfish and
a reckless ass whole.

04:46.272 --> 04:48.337
If I'd of knew you'd be
this much of a headache

04:48.339 --> 04:50.673
I would of never approved
your transfer from New York.

04:50.675 --> 04:52.742
What do you got to say
for yourself, Wilkins?

04:52.744 --> 04:54.343
I mean, basically I
just wanted to say...

04:54.345 --> 04:55.279
Shut up, okay?

04:55.281 --> 04:57.480
I'm still not done talking.

04:57.482 --> 04:59.282
I want you to know that I know
that you've been putting in

04:59.284 --> 05:01.484
application to get into the FBI.

05:01.486 --> 05:04.053
And they called me
for recommendations.

05:04.055 --> 05:04.923
What they say?

05:06.958 --> 05:09.225
They asked and I
told them the truth.

05:09.227 --> 05:10.493
That you're not ready.

05:10.495 --> 05:11.761
What, are you serious?

05:11.763 --> 05:12.728
I need this.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.564
No, I need you to
get your shit together.

05:14.566 --> 05:15.765
I can't have you
going over there

05:15.767 --> 05:17.800
pulling the same mess
that you do here,

05:17.802 --> 05:18.534
not on my name.

05:18.536 --> 05:19.969
I will change once I get...

05:19.971 --> 05:21.973
I need you to change now.

05:24.876 --> 05:26.242
I can't believe
you're doing this.

05:26.244 --> 05:27.442
I'm
gonna give you like,

05:27.444 --> 05:29.045
one or two years,
and then we'll see

05:29.047 --> 05:30.079
what's good with the transfer.

05:30.081 --> 05:31.280
A year?

05:31.282 --> 05:32.349
Look,

05:33.785 --> 05:36.953
you got the skills
and the experience

05:36.955 --> 05:37.920
to get you in the door,

05:37.922 --> 05:39.689
but it's your character
that will determine

05:39.691 --> 05:41.826
how long you stay there, Elijah.

05:43.795 --> 05:44.661
Whatever dude.

05:52.669 --> 05:54.003
You still arguing with Wilkins

05:54.005 --> 05:55.604
over that FBI transfer.

05:55.606 --> 05:56.571
Mind your own business.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.441
Why don't you let that man go?

05:59.443 --> 06:01.845
Some of those FBI guys
are no better than him.

06:03.547 --> 06:05.582
True, but honestly,

06:06.817 --> 06:08.752
he's the best
detective I've got.

06:31.909 --> 06:33.475
Daddy,
what are you doing?

06:33.477 --> 06:35.410
Sup baby girl?

06:35.412 --> 06:37.479
I have to protect
you from bad guys.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.880
Come here.

06:38.882 --> 06:40.316
You still remember
what I taught you?

06:40.318 --> 06:42.918
All right, let me see
what you got, ready?

06:42.920 --> 06:43.919
Bam.

06:43.921 --> 06:46.988
Boom, jab right,
boom, boom, boom,

06:46.990 --> 06:49.758
down low, too slow.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.860
Now look, you gotta promise
me not to be out here

06:51.862 --> 06:53.428
using the swing
at friends, okay?

06:53.430 --> 06:55.666
Only if you gotta
defend yourself.

06:56.733 --> 06:58.936
Come on, sit down, let's
have a talk with daddy.

07:04.541 --> 07:06.574
Daddy, when you go
and defend a bad guy,

07:06.576 --> 07:09.611
sometimes I get scared that
you won't come back home.

07:09.613 --> 07:13.048
Come here baby girl.

07:13.050 --> 07:15.317
Listen, I don't want
you ever have to worry

07:15.319 --> 07:16.918
about your father, okay?

07:16.920 --> 07:19.621
I can't promise you that
I'm always gonna be here,

07:19.623 --> 07:21.690
but I can let you know is
that I'm working hard enough

07:21.692 --> 07:23.158
so I ever were to depart,

07:23.160 --> 07:25.327
you will be taken care of, okay?

07:25.329 --> 07:26.828
I love you.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.797
Daddy, you hug me too tight.

07:28.799 --> 07:30.832
You know you
like it, come here.

07:30.834 --> 07:31.702
Raa.

07:35.471 --> 07:37.772
Momma wants us to come
in the house for dinner.

07:37.774 --> 07:39.977
All right, come on,
let's go see mommy.

07:40.844 --> 07:43.278
Can I take Madison inside too.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.446
What?

07:44.448 --> 07:45.779
Little girl, if you
don't get in this house.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.454
Mm, smells
good up in here.

07:52.456 --> 07:53.687
Did you all wash her hands?

07:53.689 --> 07:56.057
I did
but Daddy didn't.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.591
Baby,
you snitching on me.

07:57.593 --> 07:59.493
Elijah, go wash your hands.

07:59.495 --> 08:00.830
Oh my gosh.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.667
All right, what we eatin'
for dinner tonight?

08:06.669 --> 08:08.136
Spaghetti.

08:08.138 --> 08:09.536
Spaghetti?

08:09.538 --> 08:11.605
Baby, I thought you were
gonna make me some tacos?

08:11.607 --> 08:13.707
Uh-uh, don't be ungrateful,

08:13.709 --> 08:15.076
be glad I made you dinner.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.078
Oh, you're lookin'
out for your man.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.078
Come here girl.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.282
Ew.

08:20.616 --> 08:24.754
Babe stop, eat your
food before it gets cold.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.125
So, how was work?

08:30.092 --> 08:31.959
I don't wanna talk
about it right now.

08:31.961 --> 08:34.695
Daddy didn't take
out some bad guys.

08:34.697 --> 08:36.830
Baby you know I did.

08:36.832 --> 08:39.299
What happened after
you busted them?

08:39.302 --> 08:40.335
I don't wanna
talk about it now,

08:40.337 --> 08:42.236
just eat your spaghetti.

08:42.238 --> 08:43.371
I do.

08:43.373 --> 08:44.306
What happened?

08:46.142 --> 08:47.610
Well, if you must know,

08:48.644 --> 08:50.913
Lieutenant denied my
transfer to the FBI.

08:53.716 --> 08:56.884
How long are you
gonna do this FBI stuff?

08:56.886 --> 08:58.118
Babe, I'm not gonna
have this conversation

08:58.120 --> 09:00.621
with you right now,
I'm really not.

09:00.623 --> 09:04.758
I'm tired of hearing
about the FBI all the time.

09:04.760 --> 09:05.726
If you need to start
raising your voice

09:05.728 --> 09:06.860
in front of my daughter.

09:06.862 --> 09:08.228
Don't tell me to
stop getting worked up

09:08.230 --> 09:10.230
in front of our daughter.

09:10.232 --> 09:12.099
Baby, why don't you
go inside your room

09:12.101 --> 09:13.267
while I talk to your mum.

09:13.269 --> 09:16.370
Mm-mm, Jasmine, don't move
a muscle, eat your food.

09:16.372 --> 09:17.538
Okay.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.208
I think I just lost my appetite.

09:21.043 --> 09:23.245
Baby, sit here while
I go talk to your dad.

09:34.223 --> 09:35.891
She trippin' boy.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.928
What is your problem?

09:40.529 --> 09:41.962
So now you wanna
talk about it?

09:41.964 --> 09:44.831
Why can't you just stick
to being a detective?

09:44.833 --> 09:47.201
It's bad enough I
hardly see you as it is.

09:47.203 --> 09:48.435
Or I have to worry about

09:48.437 --> 09:50.372
going to view your
body at the morgue.

09:51.639 --> 09:53.540
Baby, why you
acting brand new?

09:53.542 --> 09:54.941
You know I wanted
to be an FBI agent

09:54.943 --> 09:56.678
since we met in high school.

09:57.645 --> 09:59.513
I do, but you been
pursuing this career

09:59.515 --> 10:01.248
for over 10 years.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.817
All I'm saying is, be
thankful for what you have.

10:04.819 --> 10:06.688
It's not like we're struggling.

10:07.922 --> 10:10.056
Besides, do you really think
they're gonna let a black man

10:10.058 --> 10:11.958
from the hood, in the
counter intelligence

10:11.960 --> 10:12.825
- or the FBI?
- Hold on, hold on,

10:12.827 --> 10:13.793
hold on, hold one.

10:13.795 --> 10:14.861
Fist of all, I'm different,

10:14.863 --> 10:16.731
and I thought you had my back.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.234
See that's the problem.

10:20.236 --> 10:23.002
We always have your back.

10:23.004 --> 10:24.205
What about me?

10:24.906 --> 10:26.205
Seems like all I'm good for

10:26.207 --> 10:28.908
is giving you babies,
feeding you, and a good fuck.

10:28.910 --> 10:32.613
Now you know you
mean more to me than that.

10:32.615 --> 10:33.980
Then prove it.

10:33.982 --> 10:35.783
Why haven't I got a ring yet?

10:36.918 --> 10:39.819
At least give me something
to look forward to.

10:39.821 --> 10:41.622
I'm tired of my
mum and my sisters

10:41.624 --> 10:43.823
always harassing me
about my life, asking,

10:43.825 --> 10:45.693
when's he gonna marry you?

10:46.694 --> 10:48.161
Baby,

10:48.163 --> 10:50.497
if I was married they would
not have made me detective,

10:50.499 --> 10:52.566
and you know this.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.167
It has to jeopardize
the whole situation.

10:54.169 --> 10:55.236
Like I said,

10:56.237 --> 10:58.905
it's always about you.

10:58.907 --> 11:00.775
Oh, it's about me, huh?

11:01.843 --> 11:03.676
You know, it's really funny
how you're saying that

11:03.678 --> 11:05.311
but you don't say that
when I'm taking you out

11:05.313 --> 11:06.812
on them shopping sprees.

11:06.814 --> 11:08.014
Or what about this Mercedes Benz

11:08.016 --> 11:09.715
I bought you from
my promotion, huh?

11:09.717 --> 11:11.319
Oh, you love driving that.

11:12.987 --> 11:15.588
Are you coming
back to eat with me?

11:15.590 --> 11:16.989
Baby, please
go back to the kitchen,

11:16.991 --> 11:18.457
Daddy and Mummy
are just talking,

11:18.459 --> 11:19.460
we'll be right down.

11:24.032 --> 11:24.933
Look baby,

11:26.201 --> 11:27.101
I'm sorry, okay?

11:27.969 --> 11:29.135
I just need you to believe in me

11:29.137 --> 11:31.504
like you believe
in me for that job.

11:31.506 --> 11:34.207
I'm so close I can feel it.

11:34.209 --> 11:35.076
I love you.

11:35.809 --> 11:37.709
And I need you.

11:37.711 --> 11:38.743
So believe me when I say,

11:38.745 --> 11:40.747
I will make you my wife, okay?

11:43.884 --> 11:45.351
I guess this is a bad time

11:45.353 --> 11:47.353
to tell you I'm pregnant.

11:47.355 --> 11:50.156
You're what?

11:50.158 --> 11:51.557
Baby you pregnant?

11:51.559 --> 11:52.757
We're gonna have a kid?

11:52.759 --> 11:55.228
Yeah.

11:55.230 --> 11:57.129
Okay, nah, that's all good,
you know what I'm saying?

11:57.131 --> 11:58.331
'Cause once I'm in the FBI,
you know what I'm saying?

11:58.333 --> 12:00.899
I'm gonna be making
an extra 10 G's a year

12:00.901 --> 12:03.569
and then training, I'm
getting two K a week.

12:03.571 --> 12:07.508
Baby, we gonna be good, baby,
we gonna baby, Mrs. Wilkins.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.648
Uh-uh, don't start nothin'
you can't finish right now.

12:15.650 --> 12:17.518
Wait until Jasmine goes to bed.

12:18.386 --> 12:22.856
I like that.

12:23.924 --> 12:26.124
Where that damn remote at?

12:34.402 --> 12:39.170
Yeah.

12:39.172 --> 12:41.540
Y'all tryna roll this
dice though, what's up?

12:41.542 --> 12:43.576
You all brought money?

12:43.578 --> 12:45.377
I'm gonna let y'all
know right now

12:45.379 --> 12:47.345
I'm taking all your money.

12:47.347 --> 12:49.682
Shut up Max, all you
do is run your mouth,

12:49.684 --> 12:50.949
let's see what you got.

12:50.951 --> 12:52.250
He ain't gonna win
anyway, he bad luck.

12:52.252 --> 12:54.152
Hello Danny, I'm
taking your money first.

12:54.154 --> 12:55.155
All right.

12:55.889 --> 12:57.122
Let's go.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.089
Nigga, them were

12:58.091 --> 12:59.424
Ay, how much you puttin' up B?

12:59.426 --> 13:00.792
Nah, I'm just gonna watch.

13:00.794 --> 13:03.228
I'm saving my money for
the ice cream truck.

13:03.230 --> 13:05.130
Nigga, why you always
gotta act a buster?

13:05.132 --> 13:06.831
What you need to do
is roll this dice

13:06.833 --> 13:08.099
and flip that money
so you can buy you

13:08.101 --> 13:09.769
a shit load of ice cream.

13:09.771 --> 13:11.169
I'm good.

13:11.171 --> 13:12.103
Ay my nigga, why keep
bothering this nigga, bro,

13:12.105 --> 13:13.071
He ain't tryna shoot bros.

13:13.073 --> 13:14.306
Just shut up and keep rolling.

13:14.308 --> 13:15.175
Okay.

13:29.323 --> 13:32.125
Hey, I like these bro,
where you get these from?

13:34.594 --> 13:36.995
Hey, where you nigga's from?

13:36.997 --> 13:38.396
Hey nigga, what you
mean where we from.

13:38.398 --> 13:39.364
Nigga, don't play stupid,

13:40.033 --> 13:41.433

13:41.435 --> 13:42.734
Hey my nigga, we got a
problem or what my nigga?

13:42.736 --> 13:44.102
Yo, can't be
killin', let's just go.

13:44.104 --> 13:46.738
Hey man fuck that, I ain't
going nowhere my nigga.

13:46.740 --> 13:47.938
Take your bitch ass home nigga,

13:47.940 --> 13:50.709
I ain't scared of none
of you bitch ass nigga.

13:50.711 --> 13:52.076
Pussy.

13:52.078 --> 13:53.877
Hey my nigga, don't let
these nigga's punk y'all bro.

13:53.879 --> 13:56.614
Oh Danny, you cold man.

13:56.616 --> 13:59.751
Oh shoot, they comin' back.

14:03.590 --> 14:08.428
- Danny, get up man.
- Danny.

14:09.128 --> 14:09.927
Come on open your eyes.

14:09.929 --> 14:11.230
Come on Danny.

14:12.432 --> 14:13.431
Danny what's wrong?

14:13.433 --> 14:16.570
Danny come on, get up,
Danny, we gotta go.

14:18.805 --> 14:19.671
Danny.

14:23.377 --> 14:24.376
Danny.

14:27.012 --> 14:28.615
Baby, it's okay.

14:30.049 --> 14:31.649
I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry.

14:31.651 --> 14:32.517
Go back to sleep.

14:32.519 --> 14:33.520
I'm sorry.

14:52.806 --> 14:54.338
Wake up Cinderella.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.472
Apparently there's
another player

14:55.474 --> 14:57.307
in the Spencer
Williams murder ring.

14:57.309 --> 14:59.376
There's always another player.

14:59.378 --> 15:00.277
You got any leads?

15:00.279 --> 15:01.945
Some fella by the name of Ace.

15:01.947 --> 15:04.281
They say he hangs
around Mid Town.

15:04.283 --> 15:05.682
Mid Town?

15:05.684 --> 15:07.484
Well I got a plug down there.

15:07.486 --> 15:08.719
Hmm, well good.

15:08.721 --> 15:10.721
Get down there and get as
much information as you can

15:10.723 --> 15:12.857
so we can finally
close this case.

15:12.859 --> 15:14.958
All right, I'll get
down there a little later.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.694
No, no, no, no, I
need you to go now.

15:17.696 --> 15:19.229
Lieutenant, I just woke up.

15:19.231 --> 15:22.366
I don't care, when I call
you that means you on the clock

15:22.368 --> 15:24.668
so you get your
ass down there now.

15:24.670 --> 15:26.038
All right, damn.

15:30.075 --> 15:32.711
Baby, I gotta go in.

15:35.947 --> 15:36.814
Hmm.

15:36.816 --> 15:38.150
I gotta go into work.

15:39.652 --> 15:41.320
Don't be gone all day.

15:42.822 --> 15:44.121
You know I'm comin' back,

15:44.123 --> 15:46.358
'cause it's my duty
to please this booty.

15:47.193 --> 15:48.561
Oh, you're so corny.

15:57.736 --> 15:59.536
Baby, what you watchin'?

15:59.538 --> 16:02.306
I don't know, some
guys dutiful head.

16:02.308 --> 16:05.375
That's
Donald Trump baby.

16:05.377 --> 16:07.143
Unfortunately he's
our president.

16:07.145 --> 16:09.178
Oh, I've heard of him.

16:09.180 --> 16:11.615
The kids at my school say
he doesn't like people

16:11.617 --> 16:12.950
that look like me.

16:12.952 --> 16:14.283
I don't understand.

16:14.285 --> 16:17.019
I'm just a kid and
never did anything.

16:17.021 --> 16:18.422
I know baby.

16:18.424 --> 16:21.023
Some peoples hearts are
led by ignorance, you know?

16:21.025 --> 16:22.559
But I don't want you
using that as an excuse

16:22.561 --> 16:24.026
not to excel.

16:24.028 --> 16:27.029
You're a Wilkins, and
Wilkins, we overcome anything.

16:27.031 --> 16:28.197
Just want you to make sure

16:28.199 --> 16:29.500
you judge people
by their character

16:29.502 --> 16:30.834
and not by the
color of their skin,

16:30.836 --> 16:31.768
you got that?

16:31.770 --> 16:33.002
Okay Daddy.

16:33.004 --> 16:34.638
All right, turn
on some cartoons.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.404
I love you, I'll be back,

16:35.406 --> 16:37.774
listen to what your mother says.

16:37.776 --> 16:38.644
Bye.

17:18.849 --> 17:20.215
Ay yo, step into my office.

17:20.218 --> 17:21.416
Man, what you want man?

17:21.419 --> 17:23.020
Why you gotta ask
all these questions?

17:23.021 --> 17:24.954
Just get in the whip and
holla at me for a second.

17:24.955 --> 17:25.887
Nah, whatever you gotta say

17:25.890 --> 17:27.223
you can say it right here.

17:27.224 --> 17:28.958
I don't think you want
everybody knowin' your business,

17:28.960 --> 17:30.361
if you know what I'm sayin'.

17:41.573 --> 17:43.241
What you want now man?

17:44.509 --> 17:46.174
Yo, why you always gotta
sit in the back seat?

17:46.176 --> 17:47.677
'Cause snitches
sit in the front,

17:47.679 --> 17:49.512
and I ain't no fuckin' snitch.

17:49.514 --> 17:51.781
Ain't nobody even
thinkin' about your ass.

17:51.783 --> 17:54.450
Besides, nobody even know
I'm a cop besides you.

17:54.452 --> 17:56.519
Yeah, aight, that's
what you think.

17:56.521 --> 17:57.954
So what's up, you
got something to say?

17:57.956 --> 17:59.254
'Cause if not, I'm out.

17:59.256 --> 18:00.423
Like you got
somethin' better to do

18:00.425 --> 18:02.257
than sit your ass up
on that street corner.

18:02.259 --> 18:03.191
So why don't you
do something good

18:03.193 --> 18:05.428
for your community for once?

18:05.430 --> 18:07.063
Man, you playin', I'm out.

18:07.065 --> 18:08.499
What you know about Ace?

18:10.034 --> 18:10.933
Who?

18:10.935 --> 18:12.470
Ace, do you know him?

18:13.605 --> 18:14.570
Never heard of him.

18:14.572 --> 18:16.271
Okay.

18:16.273 --> 18:18.306
You deaf, dumb, blind,
and stupid again.

18:18.308 --> 18:20.612
You know, well you can get
the hell out of my whip.

18:23.347 --> 18:24.749
This fuckin' nigga man.

18:25.717 --> 18:27.182
On second thought, hold up.

18:27.184 --> 18:29.419
Hold on, let me holla
at you for a second.

18:30.420 --> 18:31.854
You know, I figured
some of this fresh air

18:31.856 --> 18:32.890
may jog your memory.

18:33.858 --> 18:35.357
So who's Ace?

18:35.359 --> 18:37.026
Man, I already told
you I don't know.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.229
Why do you keep
messing with me, Jah?

18:40.832 --> 18:42.698
Why I keep messing with you?

18:42.700 --> 18:44.299
You know, it's funny
how quickly you forgot

18:44.301 --> 18:45.901
you on two strikes,

18:45.903 --> 18:47.069
and I can be even funnier

18:47.071 --> 18:48.703
and get those charges
buried up on my desk

18:48.705 --> 18:49.805
and make that three.

18:49.807 --> 18:52.309
How many years you get
for three strikes again?

18:53.310 --> 18:55.310
So I'm suppose to
be scared now, nigga?

18:55.312 --> 18:56.811
You don't have shit on me.

18:56.813 --> 18:59.381
I know them streets
like I know them laws.

18:59.383 --> 19:00.782
Besides, I've been
to jail already,

19:00.784 --> 19:02.550
it ain't nothin' I ain't seen.

19:02.552 --> 19:03.284
Okay.

19:03.286 --> 19:04.219
- Yeah.
- So you cool

19:04.221 --> 19:05.420
with talking to your family

19:05.422 --> 19:06.354
between a glass wall is
what you sayin', huh?

19:06.356 --> 19:07.522
Did I stutter, nigga?

19:07.524 --> 19:09.924
Let me make this
more clear for you.

19:09.926 --> 19:11.760
You ain't gettin' shit outta me,

19:11.762 --> 19:12.727
so matter of fact,

19:12.729 --> 19:14.865
don't even come around
here no more, tough guy.

19:16.266 --> 19:18.667
Aight, three strikes
comin' for that ass.

19:18.669 --> 19:19.536
Good luck, Jah.

19:42.325 --> 19:43.992
Old Hopper messed up.

19:43.994 --> 19:45.093
So what have we got here?

20:41.218 --> 20:42.683
Yeah, what's up?

20:42.685 --> 20:44.819
Good news, we got Ace
down here for questioning

20:44.821 --> 20:45.820
and I think we got enough

20:45.822 --> 20:47.021
to put him away
for good this time.

20:47.023 --> 20:49.256
Well I'll be damned.

20:49.258 --> 20:50.457
You sound mad.

20:50.459 --> 20:51.926
You're mad somebody
got to him before you?

20:51.928 --> 20:55.163
No I just wasted my
entire day doing nothin'.

20:55.165 --> 20:56.131
Where?

20:56.133 --> 20:57.264
Some old trap house.

20:57.266 --> 20:59.234
Wait, the one near Anderson?

20:59.236 --> 21:01.035
Yep, supposedly
this is where Ace

21:01.037 --> 21:02.237
ran his supply.

21:02.239 --> 21:03.871
I think he cleaned it
out about two weeks ago

21:03.873 --> 21:06.974
after he found out we were
shuttin' down all his allies.

21:06.976 --> 21:08.375
Well that's good to know.

21:08.377 --> 21:10.310
Look, I'll be over there
shortly, stand by, aight?

21:10.312 --> 21:12.515
Hurry up, handle that.

21:39.708 --> 21:40.843
What's this?

21:44.246 --> 21:45.080
C4.

21:50.052 --> 21:51.420
Dodger Stadium.

21:52.922 --> 21:54.023
Put this back.

22:20.648 --> 22:22.785
So you're the one
they call Ace, huh?

22:25.653 --> 22:27.122
Why do they call you that?

22:28.824 --> 22:31.126
'Cause I'm the highest
suit in the deck.

22:32.094 --> 22:33.595
Ace bigger than a king.

22:35.064 --> 22:37.599
Yeah, until someone
pulls a joker on you.

22:39.235 --> 22:40.870
Ain't got no time for jokers.

22:43.138 --> 22:44.839
See they all get knocked off.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.443
So,

22:50.279 --> 22:53.280
since you gonna be
questioning to death,

22:53.282 --> 22:56.216
the least you could do
is hand me a cigarette.

22:56.218 --> 22:57.785
Who says I have a cigarette?

23:00.155 --> 23:01.956
I know a smoker
when I see one.

23:08.364 --> 23:10.431
I don't
normally do this.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.502
That's what they always say.

23:16.638 --> 23:18.740
Then they come crawling back,

23:20.309 --> 23:21.509
like fucking bees.

23:34.455 --> 23:35.855
Lieutenant, Lieutenant?

23:35.857 --> 23:39.458
Oh relax, you relax, this
case is about to be over.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.660
Are you busy?

23:40.662 --> 23:42.595
Well, I'm about
to get some coffee

23:42.597 --> 23:44.463
and then I'm gonna go back
in there with Agent Mendez

23:44.465 --> 23:45.965
and finish interrogating Ace.

23:45.967 --> 23:48.567
Wait, Agent
Mendez, FBI Mendez?

23:48.569 --> 23:50.236
Well apparently Ace
was into bigger things

23:50.238 --> 23:52.672
than just local
murder and drugs.

23:52.674 --> 23:53.873
I don't doubt it one bit.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.341
I think I got
something to prove it.

23:55.343 --> 23:56.876
This glass goin' bye.

23:56.878 --> 23:57.710
Wait, what?

23:57.712 --> 23:59.013
Wait a minute Wilkins.

24:00.081 --> 24:01.013
Wilkins.

24:01.015 --> 24:01.981
So you a terrorist too?

24:01.983 --> 24:03.115
What the hell
you talkin' 'bout?

24:03.117 --> 24:03.883
You can't just come in here

24:03.885 --> 24:05.051
during a private investigation.

24:05.053 --> 24:06.719
Lieutenant, have your
man stand down now.

24:06.721 --> 24:08.888
Wilkins, stand down.

24:08.890 --> 24:10.056
Nah, I got some
vital information

24:10.058 --> 24:12.093
you may need, Agent Mendez.

24:13.094 --> 24:14.592
- I'm sorry.
- What is this?

24:14.594 --> 24:16.295
Agent Mendez, this
is Detective Wilkins,

24:16.297 --> 24:19.265
he was the lead detective on
this case since the beginning.

24:19.267 --> 24:20.833
I don't know what
these are though.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.768
They're blueprints
to the Dodger Stadium.

24:22.770 --> 24:24.103
Apparently this
dude was planning

24:24.105 --> 24:25.104
to blow it up or somethin'.

24:25.106 --> 24:27.206
I don't know what the
hell he talkin' about.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.041
I ain't no damn terrorist.

24:29.043 --> 24:31.609
And I don't give a fuck
about Dodger Stadium.

24:31.611 --> 24:33.012
So what were they
doing at your trap house?

24:33.014 --> 24:35.348
Man, why don't you ask the
nigga you snatched them from?

24:35.350 --> 24:36.282
Dumb ass.

24:38.286 --> 24:39.151
- You know who I am?
- I can take it

24:39.153 --> 24:40.585
from here Detective.

24:42.889 --> 24:45.859
You keep your monkey
ass paws off my client.

24:47.095 --> 24:48.793
Else I'll have your badge.

24:48.795 --> 24:50.096
Who the hell are you?

24:50.098 --> 24:53.265
I'm Thomas Johnson,
attorney of law.

24:53.267 --> 24:54.367
There'll be no
further questioning

24:54.369 --> 24:56.102
till otherwise stated.

24:56.104 --> 24:57.535
Johnson.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.472
Oh, Mendez.

24:59.474 --> 25:01.072
Why am I not surprised
to see you here?

25:01.074 --> 25:02.941
Always defending the
scum of the earth.

25:02.943 --> 25:06.544
Mendez, you don't wanna
start a battle you can't win.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.414
So now I suggest we wrap
up this little party

25:08.416 --> 25:11.285
so my client here,
Mr. Big mouth,

25:13.488 --> 25:14.686
will be on his way.

25:14.688 --> 25:16.389
Nah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.256
He committed the crime,

25:17.258 --> 25:18.424
he's gotta pay the time.

25:18.426 --> 25:21.159
Now I see we have
an overly anxious cop.

25:21.161 --> 25:22.696
Struggling to prove himself.

25:23.431 --> 25:24.996
My suggestion to you, rookie,

25:24.998 --> 25:27.665
is to stand down if you
know what's good for you.

25:27.667 --> 25:28.833
You know what?

25:28.835 --> 25:29.567
I ain't scared of no
damn lawyers, all right?

25:29.569 --> 25:30.971
I am the law.

25:32.105 --> 25:34.773
Nigga, you ain't shit
but a sellout with a badge.

25:34.775 --> 25:35.940
You know, I'm 'bout tired
of you running your mouth.

25:35.942 --> 25:37.742
Wilkins, stand
down, matter of fact

25:37.744 --> 25:40.045
in my office right now.

25:40.047 --> 25:42.180
Wilkins, now.

25:42.182 --> 25:44.015
Lookin' like
an RnB singing ass nigga.

25:44.017 --> 25:45.118
- Right now, bring your ass.
- Get your ass, B.

25:48.121 --> 25:51.056
- Before I do it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:51.058 --> 25:53.725
Mendez, will that be
a problem if I have

25:53.727 --> 25:55.896
some personal time
with my client here.

25:56.596 --> 25:57.462
Some personal time?

25:57.464 --> 25:58.830
Yeah.

25:58.832 --> 26:00.934
Suggest you tell your
client to keep his mouth shut.

26:03.970 --> 26:06.873
It wouldn't be a problem
if can get two diet cokes?

26:10.377 --> 26:13.211
What the fuck am I
gonna do with you?

26:14.781 --> 26:18.183
Every time I turn around,
you in fuckin' trouble.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.885
I got enough shit goin'
on with other clients

26:20.887 --> 26:22.786
that I can't even tend to

26:22.788 --> 26:24.856
because I gotta
babysit your ass.

26:24.858 --> 26:26.857
Now fill out this paperwork

26:26.859 --> 26:29.963
so I can get you
outta her by tonight.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.001
You know what?

26:36.036 --> 26:38.536
When all this is over
you're gonna throw me

26:38.538 --> 26:40.171
a big ass party.

26:40.173 --> 26:41.905
That's what you gonna do.

26:41.907 --> 26:45.176
Are you outta your damn mind?

26:45.178 --> 26:48.546
You really trying to mess this
up for yourself, aren't you?

26:48.548 --> 26:50.781
Like I said, you're
too reckless.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.015
Okay, I'm sorry.

26:52.017 --> 26:53.518
Maybe I got a little
excited, all right?

26:53.520 --> 26:54.918
Yeah, well your
excitement is making you,

26:54.920 --> 26:58.655
me, and the whole, entire
precinct look like we're idiots.

26:58.657 --> 27:00.558
Somebody's planning an
attack on the Dodger Stadium.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.626
For all we know I just
saved a bunch of lives.

27:02.628 --> 27:04.429
But how you did it

27:04.431 --> 27:06.531
is not how you
handle the situation.

27:06.533 --> 27:08.466
For all we know, it
coulda been a little kid

27:08.468 --> 27:10.069
playing with those blueprints.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.341
- Lieutenant?
- Mendez.

27:15.274 --> 27:16.409
We had to let Ace go.

27:17.477 --> 27:18.809
But as far as these blueprints,

27:18.811 --> 27:20.244
we're gonna look a little
further into these.

27:20.246 --> 27:23.647
I have a strong feeling this
may be someone else's doing.

27:23.649 --> 27:24.582
But Detective?

27:24.584 --> 27:25.782
Wilkins, Elijah Wilkins.

27:25.784 --> 27:26.950
Detective Wilkins,
you got time tomorrow

27:26.952 --> 27:28.553
to talk more about
your investigation?

27:28.555 --> 27:29.421
Sure do.

27:30.624 --> 27:31.822
Here's my card.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.190
Give me a call first
thing in the morning.

27:33.192 --> 27:34.324
No problem.

27:34.326 --> 27:36.093
Lieutenant.

27:36.095 --> 27:37.094
Agent Mendez.

27:37.096 --> 27:37.928
I'll
call you later on.

27:37.930 --> 27:39.165
Look forward to it.

27:40.366 --> 27:41.734
Ah, Agent Mendez?

27:42.535 --> 27:43.635
Agent Mendez?

27:43.637 --> 27:44.835
Agent Mendez?

27:44.837 --> 27:45.669
Can I
help you Wilkins,

27:45.671 --> 27:46.870
I'm kinda in a hurry?

27:46.872 --> 27:48.305
I'm sorry, I don't
mean to hold you up.

27:48.307 --> 27:49.339
I just wanna know how long
you been with the bureau?

27:49.341 --> 27:51.041
Little over 10 years.

27:51.043 --> 27:52.409
So that means you're
pretty well connected

27:52.411 --> 27:54.044
with a couple recruiters
and things like that, right?

27:54.046 --> 27:56.013
I am one of the recruiters.

27:56.015 --> 27:57.014
Really?

27:57.016 --> 27:59.983
Look, you're tryna
get into the FBI, right?

27:59.985 --> 28:00.819
Yeah.

28:01.854 --> 28:04.190
You kind of remind
me of a recruit I had.

28:05.124 --> 28:06.523
Well I bet he
made a fine agent.

28:06.525 --> 28:08.292
Actually, he's dead.

28:08.294 --> 28:09.795
He died in the line of duty.

28:11.597 --> 28:12.795
Are you sure you want this life?

28:12.797 --> 28:14.398
You damn right
I want this life.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.967
Everybody thinks the grass
in greener on the other side.

28:16.969 --> 28:18.268
But I want smart recruits

28:18.270 --> 28:19.636
who can take matters
into their own hands

28:19.638 --> 28:21.004
while still working as a team.

28:21.006 --> 28:23.073
Recruits who won't end
up like that dead recruit

28:23.075 --> 28:24.474
I just spoke of.

28:24.476 --> 28:26.878
Like I said, I
can be that dude.

28:28.614 --> 28:30.113
You have my card.

28:30.115 --> 28:32.117
After this case is
done we can talk.

28:33.385 --> 28:34.618
Thank you.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.886
Hey, I'm ain't gonna
let you down, aight.

28:36.888 --> 28:38.689
You better not be
harassing that woman

28:38.691 --> 28:41.491
about getting into
the FBI, Wilkins?

28:41.493 --> 28:42.659
No, I'm not harassing her.

28:42.661 --> 28:44.494
And yes I asked about the FBI.

28:44.496 --> 28:45.828
And what'd she say?

28:45.830 --> 28:47.497
Nuttin', it's about
me proving myself.

28:47.499 --> 28:50.066
Now, if you excuse me, I got
something I gotta take care of.

28:50.068 --> 28:53.905
Look, I know you too well,

28:54.872 --> 28:56.739
you better not be
plan around this case,

28:56.741 --> 28:58.375
don't follow her.

28:58.377 --> 29:01.678
You barking up a tree you ain't
big enough to piss on son.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.112
Lieutenant, I'm a grown man

29:03.114 --> 29:04.816
and I do whatever I please.

29:06.918 --> 29:09.919
If you walk out that door,
and you pursue this case,

29:09.921 --> 29:11.821
your job here as a detective,

29:11.823 --> 29:13.390
any chance you feel like you got

29:13.392 --> 29:15.960
to get into the FBI
is over, you hear me?

29:16.961 --> 29:18.528
No risk, no reward, right?

29:18.530 --> 29:20.331
Mm-hmm.

29:25.169 --> 29:26.402
I quit.

29:26.404 --> 29:28.406
Wilkins, get back here.

29:29.340 --> 29:31.175
Wilkins, don't you.

29:45.356 --> 29:48.326
Good thing I keep
a spare badge up in here.

30:30.668 --> 30:32.136
- Barry?
- Yeah.

30:37.475 --> 30:38.576
Where's my briefcase?

30:39.876 --> 30:40.911
It's in there.

30:42.580 --> 30:43.481
What's in there.

30:45.483 --> 30:46.950
Your briefcase.

30:50.688 --> 30:51.754
It's in there.

30:51.756 --> 30:53.090
What's it doing in there?

30:53.890 --> 30:55.058
Well I brought it,

30:55.793 --> 30:57.959
I brought it there earlier

30:57.961 --> 31:02.299
because how I told you when
I went back to see you.

31:03.033 --> 31:04.767
You're in deep shit now bro.

31:04.769 --> 31:05.636
Let's go.

31:09.741 --> 31:11.208
Take it easy on him boys.

31:48.278 --> 31:50.311
All right man.

31:50.313 --> 31:51.148
Okay.

32:04.294 --> 32:06.163
Where is the damn briefcase?

32:10.500 --> 32:14.037
Why in the hell did
you bring it here?

32:15.739 --> 32:17.140
Let alone leave it.

32:22.579 --> 32:23.680
Sorry Connor.

32:25.948 --> 32:27.016
Okay.

32:30.220 --> 32:34.522
Sorry Connor, I came here to
come pick up some stuff but...

32:34.524 --> 32:35.392
Some stuff?

32:41.298 --> 32:43.865
You been smokin'
that garbage again.

32:43.867 --> 32:45.834
Just a little bit,

32:45.836 --> 32:47.635
just for my anxiety.

32:50.474 --> 32:52.342
Yeah, that hurt.

32:55.010 --> 32:57.779
Look everybody, everybody
knows this is where

32:57.781 --> 32:59.714
you buy the good stuff.

32:59.716 --> 33:03.751
So I was, I figured I'd
just come, get the stuff,

33:03.753 --> 33:05.620
and then go straight to you,

33:05.622 --> 33:07.189
go right back to your place.

33:10.760 --> 33:11.628
But um.

33:12.929 --> 33:13.996
But what?

33:18.167 --> 33:20.869
What could possibly go wrong?

33:20.871 --> 33:22.637
A cop, it was some cop.

33:22.639 --> 33:27.474
Some cop came with his
gun drawn, I saw him,

33:27.476 --> 33:29.343
I ran for it, I tripped
over that table,

33:29.345 --> 33:32.814
I tripped over that table,
I dropped the briefcase.

33:32.816 --> 33:34.916
When I went back
to try to recover,

33:34.918 --> 33:36.885
he was already around the,

33:36.887 --> 33:37.886
I just got, I got scared.

33:37.888 --> 33:38.755
Scared?

33:41.323 --> 33:42.191
Scared.

33:44.660 --> 33:45.528
Scared.

33:46.495 --> 33:47.363
He was big,

33:48.330 --> 33:50.063
yeah he was big, he had a gun,

33:50.065 --> 33:51.166
I had no gun.

33:53.168 --> 33:56.405
He had a gun, he was scared.

34:00.042 --> 34:02.075
Are you scared Barry?

34:02.077 --> 34:03.812
I didn't
wanna get shot.

34:11.085 --> 34:13.820
I don't work well with bees.

34:17.993 --> 34:19.562
Freeze, police.

34:21.630 --> 34:22.498
Can him.

34:27.969 --> 34:28.835
Freeze.

34:31.873 --> 34:33.309
Freeze, freeze,

34:35.243 --> 34:37.446
freeze, don't you move a muscle.

35:05.473 --> 35:06.740
Freeze.

35:32.901 --> 35:34.433
This is Lieutenant Roberts.

35:34.435 --> 35:35.735
Lieutenant, I
got a few men down

35:35.737 --> 35:36.702
at the old warehouse.

35:36.704 --> 35:38.105
Elijah, what are
you doing over there?

35:38.107 --> 35:39.039
I got more evidence.

35:39.041 --> 35:40.272
What you not understand?

35:40.274 --> 35:41.407
I know, but I
got another lead,

35:41.409 --> 35:43.175
plus I got a license plate.

35:43.177 --> 35:45.311
It's not about you
having more leads, okay?

35:45.313 --> 35:47.114
Your job is done.

35:47.116 --> 35:48.514
Get away from there otherwise

35:48.516 --> 35:50.182
I'm gonna have your ass
arrested for trespassing.

35:50.184 --> 35:51.051
Did you just hear me?

35:51.053 --> 35:52.184
I said I got more...

35:52.186 --> 35:53.386
It's over, you
have no more access

35:53.388 --> 35:55.588
to the this precinct
or it's resources.

35:55.590 --> 35:58.190
This case is in the hands
of Agent Mendez now.

35:58.192 --> 36:00.726
You have nothin' to do
with it, you're done,

36:00.728 --> 36:02.463
leave it alone.

36:09.871 --> 36:10.738
Damn.

36:11.706 --> 36:13.941
Who can I get to run
these plates for me.

36:44.439 --> 36:46.507
Well I'll be damned.

36:48.643 --> 36:50.009
Yo, what's up yo.

36:50.011 --> 36:51.744
- Haven't seen this nigga...
- In a while.

36:51.746 --> 36:53.879
Wait, hold on, hold on.

36:53.881 --> 36:55.081
You still a cop?

36:56.249 --> 36:57.850
Look man, I've been
clean for three years.

36:57.852 --> 36:58.853
I just got out.

36:59.854 --> 37:01.654
You can shake it out,
but I'm clean man.

37:01.656 --> 37:04.391
And all these other whips
around here are clean.

37:05.093 --> 37:05.960
Most of 'em.

37:07.394 --> 37:09.260
First of all you
need to chill, okay?

37:09.262 --> 37:11.296
I ain't here for no stolen cars.

37:11.298 --> 37:12.698
I need you to run
some plates for me.

37:12.700 --> 37:13.833
Come on man, you know I
don't do that shit no more.

37:13.835 --> 37:15.067
Cut this shit out.

37:15.069 --> 37:16.202
I mean, I know you ain't out
here stealing cars no more,

37:16.204 --> 37:18.137
but I know got the technology.

37:18.139 --> 37:19.805
Technology, is
this a fuckin' setup,

37:19.807 --> 37:21.173
because legally he
gotta let me know

37:21.175 --> 37:22.373
if this is a set
up or not, nigga.

37:22.375 --> 37:23.541
If you don't start
acting like we used to

37:23.543 --> 37:24.912
run these ropes together.

37:35.555 --> 37:38.991
Oh boy, you a fool, I see
you ain't changed one bit.

37:38.993 --> 37:42.128
We do go way back like four
flats on a Cadillac, baby.

37:42.130 --> 37:43.897
But you ain't on
a Cadillac baby.

37:44.831 --> 37:46.631
I know man, just
a figure of speech.

37:46.633 --> 37:48.566
Oh man, I'm so surprised
to see you, dude,

37:48.568 --> 37:50.502
I thought you were still
out there San Bernardino.

37:50.504 --> 37:52.403
Man, it got too
real out there man.

37:52.405 --> 37:54.639
I had, I got too much trouble.

37:54.641 --> 37:56.175
Yeah, but LA's where
it's at though.

37:56.177 --> 37:57.243
I agree.

37:57.245 --> 37:58.576
Bo, check me out man.

37:58.578 --> 37:59.744
I see you man, I see you.

37:59.746 --> 38:02.914
You didn't big, you
came a long ways.

38:02.916 --> 38:05.016
Like this part over here.

38:05.018 --> 38:07.118
Okay, what's that, a 2006 GTO?

38:07.120 --> 38:11.825
This dude don't know
nothin' about no cars, man.

38:12.793 --> 38:15.460
You right, it's
actually a '09 GA.

38:15.462 --> 38:17.263
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I knew that, I knew that.

38:17.265 --> 38:19.097
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
but you didn't though.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.435
- See I got jokes.
- Oh man.

38:23.470 --> 38:26.104
Hey, yo, Cat, have
you

38:26.106 --> 38:27.874
that's what he just called me.

38:29.509 --> 38:31.643
Yes, they just
rang this morning.

38:31.645 --> 38:33.945
Perfect, cool, cool, cool,
keep on stalling for me

38:33.947 --> 38:34.946
and keep me updated

38:34.948 --> 38:35.947
- about that.
- Okay.

38:35.949 --> 38:37.448
Thanks.

38:37.450 --> 38:39.918
So you're the boss, huh?

38:39.920 --> 38:40.919
Check me out baby.

38:40.921 --> 38:42.253
So what's up big boss?

38:42.255 --> 38:43.822
You gonna run these
plates for me or what?

38:43.824 --> 38:47.625
Why you need me, ain't
no cop that can do that?

38:47.627 --> 38:50.597
Computers man,
the job go down.

38:53.867 --> 38:55.133
Hold on, hold on.

38:55.135 --> 38:59.371
Hey, hey D, get your
ass to work boy.

39:00.273 --> 39:01.607
Damn man.

39:03.243 --> 39:04.108
What?

39:04.110 --> 39:05.276
Nothing, here I go.

39:05.278 --> 39:06.811
Yeah that's what I
thought you said Dante.

39:06.813 --> 39:08.478
Damn man, what am I
payin' you all for.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.082
Ay, you too Fabio.

39:11.084 --> 39:11.950
What?

39:11.952 --> 39:12.919
Man, you playin' man.

39:16.388 --> 39:19.224
How 'bout this.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.259
How 'bout we race for it?

39:21.261 --> 39:22.659
You serious?

39:22.661 --> 39:24.929
I'm a detective, what do
I look like street racing?

39:24.931 --> 39:28.967
Oh, you good then,
you don't need my help.

39:28.969 --> 39:30.603
All right Max, you win.

39:31.704 --> 39:33.974
You're gonna get your little
street race, all right?

39:36.408 --> 39:37.574
Good.

39:37.576 --> 39:38.575
So this is how
it's gonna go down.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.178
If you beat me, I will help you

39:40.180 --> 39:41.378
with whatever you
need help with.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.281
But if I win, you
get my name cleared

39:43.283 --> 39:44.282
with all those tickets I have

39:44.284 --> 39:45.949
and wipe my record.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.987
I thought you
said you was clean?

39:49.855 --> 39:50.890
Oh my gosh.

39:55.328 --> 39:56.495
Let's do this then.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.396
Let the games begin.

40:04.337 --> 40:05.636
Now you know I'm not
gonna let you race me

40:05.638 --> 40:07.838
with that hoop you got.

40:07.840 --> 40:12.542
In fact, I'm gonna give
you this SRT to play with.

40:14.314 --> 40:15.447
This guy.

40:30.562 --> 40:31.929
Okay, okay, okay,
I see you got it,

40:31.931 --> 40:33.330
all right, all right.

41:45.603 --> 41:47.605
What's up boy, what's up?

42:05.457 --> 42:06.991
Well, well, well.

42:07.992 --> 42:11.160
Mr. Max still got a
little sumin', sumin'.

42:11.162 --> 42:13.164
Little sumin', sumin'.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.531
Like your SRT man.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.466
You like that huh?

42:16.468 --> 42:17.535
Oh yeah.

42:18.504 --> 42:20.269
That's too much
power for you man.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.139
Whatever.

42:22.607 --> 42:24.040
Look man, I know
you won and all,

42:24.042 --> 42:26.978
but I still need you to
run them for me, bro.

42:29.447 --> 42:32.448
You know, technically,
I don't owe you shit.

42:32.450 --> 42:34.016
You lost.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.117
I lost.

42:35.119 --> 42:36.719
But since you my
cousin-in-law, whatever,

42:36.721 --> 42:38.454
maybe I'll let you
slide on this one.

42:38.456 --> 42:40.256
Let me slide?

42:40.258 --> 42:41.257
Yeah.

42:41.259 --> 42:42.326
Your call play boy.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.929
Come on man, let's
head back to my shop.

42:46.931 --> 42:47.799
Let's roll.

42:51.035 --> 42:54.702
So what's up man,
how's the job treating you?

42:54.704 --> 42:55.603
Honestly, I wasn't
gonna say nuttin',

42:55.605 --> 42:57.206
but I quit.

42:57.208 --> 42:58.474
What?

42:58.476 --> 43:00.109
Man, stop playing.

43:00.111 --> 43:01.045
Nah, I quit today.

43:03.214 --> 43:04.380
So you wasn't planning on

43:04.382 --> 43:05.814
getting my charges
dropped anyway?

43:07.552 --> 43:08.750
Honestly, I thought
I was gonna beat you,

43:08.752 --> 43:11.053
but I see you still got
a little sumin', sumin'.

43:11.055 --> 43:13.289
You damn right I
still got it, man.

43:13.291 --> 43:14.457
Ever since we were kids

43:14.459 --> 43:15.857
all you talked about
was you becoming a pig.

43:15.859 --> 43:17.592
- So you quit just like that.
- Wait wait, hold on, hold on,

43:17.594 --> 43:19.361
first of all I
ain't no pig, aight.

43:19.363 --> 43:20.628
And it's for a bigger 'cause.

43:20.630 --> 43:21.863
What's bigger than
you wanting to be 5O.

43:21.865 --> 43:23.600
What you mean, FBI.

43:24.734 --> 43:27.103
Damn, you still chasing
the sweet dreams, man.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.537
Come on
man, you know me.

43:28.539 --> 43:29.871
So what you doing
in the mean time?

43:29.873 --> 43:31.107
I'm working out this case.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.841
Okay, but you
still gotta get rent,

43:32.843 --> 43:34.676
don't tell me you back here
to get in the business?

43:34.678 --> 43:37.881
Oh no, I'm tryna move
forwards, not backwards.

43:39.015 --> 43:41.219
You crazy dude, let
me see the plates.

43:44.054 --> 43:44.921
Crazy ass.

43:46.623 --> 43:48.792
So what's up, man, how wifey?

43:49.926 --> 43:52.361
She gonna be pissed
when she finds out.

43:52.363 --> 43:53.728
Oh yeah.

43:53.730 --> 43:55.063
I know my cousin Kayla, and
the last thing she needs

43:55.065 --> 43:57.132
is a black ass nigga
like you with no job.

43:57.134 --> 44:00.036
Man, if you don't shut up
and find them damn plates.

44:01.138 --> 44:03.006
Come over here man, looks
like we got somethin'.

44:06.009 --> 44:07.709
Mark Connor.

44:07.711 --> 44:10.747
This dude owes you
money or somethin'?

44:11.748 --> 44:13.850
Nah, it's
worst than that.

44:15.018 --> 44:15.886
Like what?

44:16.686 --> 44:18.155
Terrorism.

44:19.089 --> 44:19.988
Damn.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.923
So you got a terrorist
on your hands?

44:21.925 --> 44:25.061
Yeah, print this up so I
can pay this dude a visit.

44:26.897 --> 44:27.697
Aight.

44:28.698 --> 44:31.132
Yo, I appreciate you
comin' through on this.

44:31.134 --> 44:32.567
Of course man.

44:32.569 --> 44:33.902
Anything for my cousin-in-law,

44:33.904 --> 44:36.504
or I should say ex
cousin-in-law after this.

44:36.506 --> 44:37.839
Hold on, whatever you do

44:37.841 --> 44:39.574
do not tell Kayla
about this, okay?

44:39.576 --> 44:41.476
I got you, relax, relax.

44:41.478 --> 44:42.911
I'm not gonna tell her nothin'.

44:42.913 --> 44:44.479
But sounds like some
next level shit,

44:44.481 --> 44:46.447
and you know I want in.

44:46.449 --> 44:48.316
All right, I got you.

44:48.318 --> 44:49.419
Take it easy Big Dog.

44:50.353 --> 44:52.155
Ay, clean your car.

46:00.690 --> 46:02.157
He was military.

46:03.259 --> 46:04.126
Interesting.

46:21.678 --> 46:23.377
- Don't shoot, don't shoot.
- Who are you?

46:23.379 --> 46:27.649
I'm the landlord, I came
to check Connor's apartment.

46:27.651 --> 46:29.783
Seems like he abandoned it.

46:29.785 --> 46:31.184
My name is Detective
Elijah Wilkins,

46:31.186 --> 46:33.220
have you seen Connor lately,
he's in a lot of trouble?

46:33.222 --> 46:35.589
I haven't seen
him in two months.

46:35.591 --> 46:38.191
He always did act weird.

46:38.193 --> 46:39.426
Two months.

46:39.428 --> 46:40.961
Weirdo.

46:40.963 --> 46:42.229
Well do me a favor ma'am,

46:42.231 --> 46:44.099
if you see him, give me a call.

46:45.301 --> 46:47.434
Yeah, I'll do that.

46:47.436 --> 46:49.036
If you see him before I do,

46:49.038 --> 46:51.305
you tell him that he
owes me two months rent.

46:51.307 --> 46:52.939
Yes ma'am.

46:52.941 --> 46:53.839
You have a good night.

46:53.841 --> 46:55.444
You too.

47:57.939 --> 48:00.141
Sweet dreams.

48:22.663 --> 48:24.964
Who is it?

48:24.966 --> 48:26.132
Ms. Wilkins?

48:26.134 --> 48:26.999
Yes.

48:27.001 --> 48:28.367
I'm Agent Morris.

48:28.369 --> 48:30.403
I understand your son,
Elijah, was the witness

48:30.405 --> 48:31.805
to the Jenkins murder>

48:31.807 --> 48:34.407
He's not my son,
he's my nephew.

48:34.409 --> 48:35.174
He's been through a lot,

48:35.176 --> 48:36.509
what do you want with him?

48:36.511 --> 48:38.010
Well, is he here?

48:38.012 --> 48:40.045
Yes, he's here,
he's in the backyard.

48:40.047 --> 48:43.249
Mind if I asked a
couple questions with him?

48:43.251 --> 48:45.985
I promise you though,
it'll go quick.

48:45.987 --> 48:47.586
All right, come on in.

48:47.588 --> 48:48.423
Thank you.

49:11.345 --> 49:12.144
How you doing.

49:12.146 --> 49:13.347
What do you want?

49:16.049 --> 49:17.483
Just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions

49:17.485 --> 49:19.017
about your friend Danny.

49:19.019 --> 49:20.621
I don't wanna talk about it.

49:21.955 --> 49:24.457
Yeah, I understand,
you're going through a lot

49:24.459 --> 49:26.759
I just wanna help
you bring to justice

49:26.761 --> 49:28.296
who did this to your friend.

49:28.995 --> 49:30.362
Why does it even matter?

49:30.364 --> 49:31.530
He's dead now.

49:31.532 --> 49:34.602
Just forget about him,
everyone else will.

49:35.937 --> 49:38.737
Elijah, I understand
what you're going through.

49:38.739 --> 49:40.140
No you don't.

49:40.875 --> 49:42.340
You're a cop.

49:42.342 --> 49:43.742
Actually, I'm not even a cop.

49:43.744 --> 49:45.546
I'm an FBI agent.

49:46.514 --> 49:49.280
And I haven't always
been in law enforcement.

49:49.282 --> 49:50.683
Back in the days I be like you,

49:50.685 --> 49:52.551
I was raised in the hood,

49:52.553 --> 49:55.019
running around here in the
streets of Los Angeles.

49:55.021 --> 49:56.287
I'm from New York.

49:56.289 --> 49:57.923
I only come in the summer.

49:57.925 --> 49:59.192
Okay, well New York.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.026
The thing is, we're
not that different.

50:02.028 --> 50:06.164
Just like you, I lost a
friend when I was young.

50:06.166 --> 50:08.299
You know what I did about it?

50:08.301 --> 50:09.501
What?

50:09.503 --> 50:12.070
Got a Nine and flushed out
anyone who was responsible.

50:12.072 --> 50:16.241
No, not quite, but I can
tell you what I did do.

50:16.243 --> 50:17.475
I went into the neighborhood,

50:17.477 --> 50:19.711
set up all kinds of
neighborhood watches,

50:19.713 --> 50:23.147
and then when I got old
enough I joined the academy.

50:23.149 --> 50:24.282
And as I was going
through the ranks,

50:24.284 --> 50:25.483
getting higher and higher,

50:25.485 --> 50:27.085
I became an agent.

50:27.087 --> 50:28.421
So what's your point.

50:29.389 --> 50:30.655
My point is, you
ain't gotta end up

50:30.657 --> 50:32.557
like everybody around here.

50:32.559 --> 50:34.125
You can just put your
mind to something

50:34.127 --> 50:36.329
and just strive to
be something better.

50:38.398 --> 50:41.768
So you're saying,
I can be a cop?

50:43.169 --> 50:45.570
Look, I'm tryna tell you

50:45.572 --> 50:47.071
you can be anything
you wanna be,

50:47.073 --> 50:49.008
you just gotta put
your mind through it,

50:49.010 --> 50:51.177
and go in set for it.

50:54.948 --> 50:56.481
You like being an agent?

50:56.483 --> 50:58.683
I don't do anything
that I don't love.

50:58.685 --> 51:00.518
All right
guys, that's enough questioning

51:00.520 --> 51:02.085
for him for tonight.

51:02.087 --> 51:03.688
You have a fine
young man here.

51:03.690 --> 51:05.292
Yes he is, he's quite brave.

51:06.393 --> 51:08.259
I'm sorry I can't
help you more.

51:08.261 --> 51:10.228
I really don't know
the guys who shot him.

51:10.230 --> 51:11.565
That's okay, that's okay.

51:12.566 --> 51:15.934
Here's my card, if you
get anymore information

51:15.936 --> 51:17.604
just give me a call, okay?

51:18.705 --> 51:19.470
Thank you sir.

51:19.472 --> 51:21.173
Let me walk you to the door.

51:48.133 --> 51:49.636
Why don't you come to bed?

51:50.670 --> 51:53.771
I'll be back in when
I finish my water.

51:53.773 --> 51:55.305
Did I scare you?

51:55.307 --> 51:57.842
I heard you when you
came out that bathroom.

51:57.844 --> 51:59.511
No you didn't silly.

52:04.951 --> 52:07.417
Oh, you still have this?

52:07.419 --> 52:08.287
Yep.

52:09.588 --> 52:11.789
I remember when you used
to pin this on your mirror

52:11.791 --> 52:12.826
when we was kids.

52:14.027 --> 52:15.361
He was your hero.

52:16.629 --> 52:17.663
What happened to him?

52:19.331 --> 52:21.266
He died of cancer.

52:23.937 --> 52:26.872
I bet he'd be
proud of you today.

52:28.975 --> 52:31.642
I ran into your
cousin today, Max.

52:31.644 --> 52:32.743
You did?

52:32.745 --> 52:33.844
Yeah.

52:33.846 --> 52:34.711
What's he talkin' about?

52:34.713 --> 52:36.413
I have to call him.

52:36.415 --> 52:38.651
Same old stuff,
working on cars.

52:42.588 --> 52:45.188
Mm.

52:45.190 --> 52:46.356
What's wrong?

52:46.358 --> 52:51.363
Hmm, oh nuttin', you
know, I'm just thinking.

52:52.064 --> 52:53.499
I do, that's why I ask.

52:55.300 --> 52:57.901
You know, I'm
just thinkin' of ways

52:57.903 --> 52:59.805
I can make my family happier.

53:00.773 --> 53:05.142
We're already happy,
baby, aren't you?

53:05.144 --> 53:08.847
I mean, I'm good, but
we can always be better.

53:11.182 --> 53:12.718
Baby I know what you want,

53:13.752 --> 53:16.855
and you're gonna get it,
just not on your time,

53:18.023 --> 53:19.391
but the right time.

53:20.426 --> 53:22.961
You can't control
everything, you're not God.

53:25.631 --> 53:28.031
Yeah, you're right,
but when I get there

53:28.033 --> 53:29.900
you're gonna be with me, right?

53:29.902 --> 53:31.367
You know I will.

53:36.075 --> 53:38.209
Babe, what about Jasmine?

53:39.111 --> 53:40.813
She's asleep, come on.

54:28.093 --> 54:30.292
Baby, what is goin' on?

54:30.294 --> 54:32.062
Do you have
somethin' to tell me?

54:32.064 --> 54:34.630
Oh my god, what,
what is going on?

54:34.632 --> 54:38.168
Do you have
something to tell me?

54:38.170 --> 54:40.836
I made love to you all
night, why you upset?

54:40.838 --> 54:43.539
Yeah, and it's the last time
you're gonna get any of this.

54:43.541 --> 54:44.408
What?

54:45.810 --> 54:48.010
I talked to my cousin
earlier this morning.

54:48.012 --> 54:49.179
Girl, you ain't gonna believe

54:49.181 --> 54:50.479
what your punk arse
boyfriend said to me.

54:50.481 --> 54:53.816
Oh my god, I told this
dude not to say nothin'.

54:53.818 --> 54:54.917
Don't say nothin'.

54:54.919 --> 54:57.753
How you gonna keep
something like this from me?

54:57.755 --> 54:59.121
Baby, 'cause I knew
you were gonna act

54:59.123 --> 55:01.123
like you're acting right now.

55:01.125 --> 55:03.459
So we're keeping secrets now?

55:03.461 --> 55:05.027
No baby, I'm not
keeping secrets

55:05.029 --> 55:06.195
- from you.
- when I saw you hide

55:06.197 --> 55:07.329
are you sleeping
with other women?

55:07.331 --> 55:08.666
What, I would
never do that to you.

55:09.834 --> 55:11.332
So when were you gonna
tell me you lost your job.

55:11.334 --> 55:13.502
I don't know, but I
promise I was gonna tell you.

55:13.504 --> 55:15.738
When, while they were
foreclosing the house?

55:15.740 --> 55:16.607
No.

55:18.442 --> 55:20.375
Elijah Malik Wilkins,
you better call

55:20.377 --> 55:22.611
who ever you need to
call to get some cheques

55:22.613 --> 55:24.480
comin' in this house, 'cause
the last thing I'm gonna do

55:24.482 --> 55:27.249
is have my daughter
sleeping out on the streets.

55:27.251 --> 55:29.752
Okay, first of all,
you need to relax, okay?

55:29.754 --> 55:32.221
Now you know I'm not gonna
let nothin' happen to Jas,

55:32.223 --> 55:33.889
I got a few stacks in the bank.

55:33.891 --> 55:36.324
It will keep us going
till I move to the FBI.

55:36.326 --> 55:37.458
The FBI?

55:37.460 --> 55:39.327
Nigga, are you delusional?

55:39.329 --> 55:40.595
You're not even a cop anymore,

55:40.597 --> 55:42.099
how you gonna be in the FBI?

55:43.034 --> 55:45.602
Go get your job back.

55:46.804 --> 55:49.104
See man, here you always
go with that bullshit, man.

55:49.106 --> 55:50.806
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

55:50.808 --> 55:52.507
Come on babe, how
you gonna come in here

55:52.509 --> 55:53.876
and hit me with pillow and all?

55:53.878 --> 55:55.410
- I wanted to worst.
- You couldn't just wake...

55:55.412 --> 55:56.578
You couldn't just
wake me up like a

55:56.580 --> 55:58.479
- normal person?
- Elijah, excuses,

55:58.481 --> 55:59.480
- that's all I'm hearing.
- It ain't excuses,

55:59.482 --> 56:00.415
- Excuses.
- I'm just

56:00.417 --> 56:01.783
keeping it real with you.

56:01.785 --> 56:02.717
I'm telling you what's
poppin', and you're just...

56:02.719 --> 56:02.854
Hurry up.

56:04.487 --> 56:05.988
And you better not
come back in this house

56:05.990 --> 56:07.156
without a job.

56:07.158 --> 56:08.356
Why don't you
get in this house

56:08.358 --> 56:08.859
before you wake
up our neighbors?

56:15.799 --> 56:16.999
Hello?

56:17.001 --> 56:18.399
Agent Mendez.

56:18.401 --> 56:21.003
Detective, what's going
on, I heard you quit?

56:21.005 --> 56:22.670
Look, never mind that.

56:22.672 --> 56:24.240
I got a feeling Ace
is not responsible

56:24.242 --> 56:26.374
for the attack on
the Dodger Stadium.

56:26.376 --> 56:28.043
I think I know who is.

56:28.045 --> 56:29.010
Who?

56:29.012 --> 56:30.145
I'd rather talk to
you in person about it,

56:30.147 --> 56:31.512
can I meet you somewhere?

56:31.514 --> 56:33.648
Yeah, meet me at my
office at FBI headquarters.

56:33.650 --> 56:35.986
Cool, I'll be there,
text me the address.

56:50.433 --> 56:51.933
Morning Wilkins.

56:51.935 --> 56:53.369
Good morning.

56:53.371 --> 56:54.504
What do you have?

56:55.772 --> 56:58.740
Well, I'm sure you happened
with me in the precinct.

56:58.742 --> 57:00.441
So before we go any further,

57:00.443 --> 57:02.443
I have some information here,

57:02.445 --> 57:05.048
and I need this to allow
me to get into the agency.

57:06.449 --> 57:07.651
Are you bribing me?

57:08.818 --> 57:09.784
You told me the other day
that I had to prove to you

57:09.786 --> 57:10.985
that I'm worthy.

57:10.987 --> 57:13.521
I tracked this guy down,
I got all his information,

57:13.523 --> 57:15.158
I need this to be my ticket in.

57:16.126 --> 57:17.625
Well that's not how it works.

57:17.627 --> 57:19.227
You have to go through
the entry process

57:19.229 --> 57:20.762
just like everyone else.

57:20.764 --> 57:22.964
And besides, these are still
nothing but assumptions

57:22.966 --> 57:26.334
and allegations, those
blueprints don't mean a thing.

57:26.336 --> 57:28.638
Okay, see this
video right here?

57:29.739 --> 57:30.939
So you're telling me you're
gonna let this mad man

57:30.941 --> 57:32.439
go and blow up an
entire stadium,

57:32.441 --> 57:33.808
is that what your telling me?

57:33.810 --> 57:36.010
My team will be all over
that stadium in a heart beat.

57:36.012 --> 57:37.644
We are well equipped
and knowledgeable

57:37.646 --> 57:40.348
to take down this
man if necessary.

57:40.350 --> 57:43.751
Listen, I need this position.

57:43.753 --> 57:45.887
I have worked my entire
life to get here,

57:45.889 --> 57:47.487
and I have nothing
else but this dream.

57:47.489 --> 57:49.756
And if I don't get
into this agency

57:49.758 --> 57:52.459
I'm gonna loose my
woman, my daughter,

57:52.461 --> 57:53.696
and their respect.

57:54.797 --> 57:56.596
I understand your situation

57:56.598 --> 57:57.798
- but I can't...
- No, no,

57:57.800 --> 57:59.334
I really don't think
you do Agent Mendez.

57:59.336 --> 58:01.570
I can't just pull
strings like that.

58:02.638 --> 58:04.172
It still has to go
through other departments

58:04.174 --> 58:07.576
before you get in, and I'm
gonna be honest with you,

58:08.944 --> 58:10.979
a lot of those guys are
not fond of black men

58:10.981 --> 58:12.447
in their division.

58:12.449 --> 58:13.780
I had to go through
as an Hispanic woman,

58:13.782 --> 58:15.249
so imagine what
you'll go through.

58:15.251 --> 58:16.417
Hold on, first of all,

58:16.419 --> 58:17.651
you think I care about
what the white man

58:17.653 --> 58:19.722
or anyone else thinks
of me of that matter?

58:20.856 --> 58:23.391
I'm telling you, I'll work
on this case for free,

58:23.393 --> 58:25.393
just give me your word
that you'll allow me

58:25.395 --> 58:26.996
to work in the agency.

58:29.466 --> 58:33.068
Excuse me.

58:35.271 --> 58:36.138
Hey.

58:37.639 --> 58:39.041
Yeah, I'll pick her up.

58:40.976 --> 58:41.844
Hey I was thi...

58:44.513 --> 58:46.515
I'm sorry about that.

58:47.549 --> 58:49.218
You're on the case.

58:50.953 --> 58:53.553
Don't you tell a single soul
you're on it, all right?

58:53.555 --> 58:54.688
Let me get a copy of that video

58:54.690 --> 58:55.655
and anything else you have.

58:55.657 --> 58:57.624
Wait, wait, wait, so I'm in.

58:57.626 --> 58:58.625
That's not what I'm saying.

58:58.627 --> 59:00.660
You're on this case.

59:00.662 --> 59:02.763
Okay, I can rock
with that, look,

59:02.765 --> 59:04.765
text me your email address
and all that good stuff

59:04.767 --> 59:05.932
and I'm gonna send
you all these videos

59:05.934 --> 59:07.300
and we're gonna
take this dude down.

59:07.302 --> 59:10.037
Me and you, we got
this, all right?

59:10.039 --> 59:11.206
That's all for you.

59:12.674 --> 59:13.742
Wait, Wilkins?

59:15.110 --> 59:16.243
You better be careful
what you ask for

59:16.245 --> 59:17.444
because you may just get it

59:17.446 --> 59:20.147
and anything else
that comes with it.

59:20.149 --> 59:21.750
Right, I'll catch you later.

59:29.058 --> 59:31.258
All right baby girl, how was
school, did you have fun?

59:31.260 --> 59:32.125
Yeah, okay.

59:32.127 --> 59:33.195
I'll take you home.

59:35.998 --> 59:36.865
Get down.

59:37.565 --> 59:38.633
Bag off.

59:39.634 --> 59:40.766
How was school, did
you have a good day,

59:40.768 --> 59:42.202
that make you play
games and stuff?

59:42.204 --> 59:43.170
Yeah?

59:43.172 --> 59:44.438
- Wow, okay?
- Okay.

59:44.440 --> 59:49.644
Okay, squeeze up in there.

59:50.345 --> 59:51.947
All right, buckle up, okay?

01:00:30.651 --> 01:00:31.817
What the hell you want?

01:00:31.819 --> 01:00:32.918
Aye, aye, aye, slow
your roll, nigga,

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.120
you know who you're talking to?

01:00:34.122 --> 01:00:35.522
Why did you tell
Kayla what happened?

01:00:35.524 --> 01:00:36.889
Nigga, that's my baby
cousin, what you mean?

01:00:36.891 --> 01:00:38.224
I'm not gonna lie to her.

01:00:38.226 --> 01:00:39.459
Well guess what?

01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:41.093
Your honesty just my life a
whole lot more complicated.

01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:42.529
Oh my god, now
stop complaining,

01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:43.762
you're acting like
a punk right now.

01:00:43.764 --> 01:00:45.499
Man Kayla will get
over that shit.

01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:48.067
But listen, now I got something
way more important for you.

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:49.235
Like what?

01:00:49.237 --> 01:00:50.769
You remember the license
plate you gave me the other day?

01:00:50.771 --> 01:00:51.971
What about it?

01:00:51.973 --> 01:00:54.006
I'm staring at it right now.

01:00:54.008 --> 01:00:54.907
Where?

01:00:54.909 --> 01:00:56.742
I'm off of
Wilshire and Fairfax.

01:00:56.744 --> 01:00:59.313
You might wanna come over
here before they bounce.

01:01:06.555 --> 01:01:07.753
All right man, I'm comin,

01:01:07.755 --> 01:01:09.421
whatever you do,
do not loose 'em.

01:01:15.096 --> 01:01:16.795
All right Jas, you know
how you talked about

01:01:16.797 --> 01:01:18.364
how much you wanna
see Daddy in action?

01:01:18.366 --> 01:01:21.035
Today's your day, but you
can't tell Mommy, okay?

01:01:57.737 --> 01:01:58.736
Kill 'em all.

01:02:28.268 --> 01:02:29.335
Daddy's gotta go, okay?

01:02:29.337 --> 01:02:30.536
I promise I'll be right back,

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:32.638
but I need you to stay right
here, you promise me that?

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.606
I promise.

01:02:33.608 --> 01:02:34.475
Okay.

01:02:55.663 --> 01:02:57.262
'Bout time you showed up.

01:02:57.264 --> 01:02:59.665
Shut up man, just
shoot these bad guys.

01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:13.839
Damn, and they
got a sniper too.

01:04:16.942 --> 01:04:18.609
Daddy, Daddy.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.017
Baby go back.

01:04:28.887 --> 01:04:30.956
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:45.104
Dude I'm out.

01:04:52.177 --> 01:04:54.279
I'm going after Connor.

01:05:56.842 --> 01:05:57.808
Out of the car.

01:05:59.511 --> 01:06:04.383
Don't shoot me,
please don't, don't shoot me.

01:06:11.557 --> 01:06:13.356
Stay right here baby.

01:06:51.763 --> 01:06:52.630
I got you.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.847
Did you get him?

01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:13.349
Nigga, does it
look like I got him?

01:07:14.519 --> 01:07:16.051
And by the way, is that your
black Camaro over there?

01:07:16.053 --> 01:07:18.554
You know that's my
black Camaro over there.

01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:20.991
Bro, don't tell me
you shot my car.

01:07:20.993 --> 01:07:22.057
- Yeah I did.
- Oh my god.

01:07:22.059 --> 01:07:23.792
You know Kayla's
gonna love that.

01:07:23.794 --> 01:07:24.662
Oh-oh.

01:07:27.665 --> 01:07:29.598
Shit man, you got 12 out here?

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.700
Yo, I'm gonna holla at
you later, I gotta bounce.

01:07:31.702 --> 01:07:33.170
Whatever dude.

01:07:33.871 --> 01:07:34.805
You all right baby?

01:07:36.173 --> 01:07:37.740
Wilkins, what
the hell are you doing here?

01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:45.981
I don't even know how
you deal with his ass.

01:07:45.983 --> 01:07:49.585
I was with Raoul
for six month, okay?

01:07:49.587 --> 01:07:51.085
And got a ring.

01:07:51.087 --> 01:07:52.790
Cubic zirconia, uh-huh.

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:56.025
Is your name even on the deed?

01:07:56.027 --> 01:07:58.429
Nah, Jah put
everything in his name.

01:07:59.664 --> 01:08:03.732
Bitch,
you got the game ass backwards.

01:08:03.734 --> 01:08:05.367
You have a baby by him,

01:08:05.369 --> 01:08:07.403
you should of got the
house in your name, okay?

01:08:07.405 --> 01:08:09.203
So when it's time for
you to leave his ass

01:08:09.205 --> 01:08:12.240
you got the child support
and you got the crib.

01:08:12.242 --> 01:08:15.243
Hello, hit his ass
where it hurts.

01:08:15.245 --> 01:08:17.779
Oh, like you did with Justin?

01:08:17.782 --> 01:08:21.716
After havin' his kid, while
messing with Raoul on the side

01:08:21.719 --> 01:08:22.585
to get your ring.

01:08:22.587 --> 01:08:23.752
Kay, and?

01:08:23.754 --> 01:08:25.554
You gotta play the game hunni,

01:08:25.555 --> 01:08:29.357
'cause if not, these dudes
is gonna play you, 'kay?

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:32.093
Now, if Justin wasn't
pullin' the same shit

01:08:32.095 --> 01:08:34.029
that Jah was pullin',
I would of never

01:08:34.031 --> 01:08:35.465
had to hit him like that.

01:08:36.433 --> 01:08:39.167
Nah, I can't do
my Jah like that.

01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:42.203
I mean, he's wild and he
gets on my nerves sometimes,

01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:44.939
but I know he's a good
man with good intentions.

01:08:44.942 --> 01:08:47.377
Okay, whatever.

01:08:52.716 --> 01:08:55.716
See, there goes
my man right there.

01:09:28.318 --> 01:09:29.886
What's up babe?

01:09:31.087 --> 01:09:33.787
What's going on with the car?

01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:36.823
We were shooting bad guys.

01:09:36.826 --> 01:09:40.162
Shooting bad guys, Elijah,
what is she talkin' about?

01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:45.332
You had my daughter in
the middle of a gun fight?

01:09:45.335 --> 01:09:47.335
Are you stupid or
are you just dumb?

01:09:47.337 --> 01:09:48.671
Oh baby, I'm sorry.

01:09:49.805 --> 01:09:51.471
Jasmine, are you okay?

01:09:51.474 --> 01:09:54.274
Yeah, I'm fine, but
it was scary though.

01:09:54.276 --> 01:09:56.446
It's okay,
you're home safe now.

01:09:57.547 --> 01:09:58.415
Go to your room.

01:09:59.115 --> 01:10:01.349
Get your baby girl.

01:10:01.351 --> 01:10:03.420
Yo, hold up, what
is she doing here?

01:10:04.421 --> 01:10:06.688
First of all, talkin'
'bout your stupid ass,

01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:08.589
you need to stop doing
my home girl wrong,

01:10:08.591 --> 01:10:11.025
and if I find out you
put your hands on her

01:10:11.027 --> 01:10:12.225
Ima cut your ass.

01:10:12.227 --> 01:10:13.427
Man, you ain't
gonna cut nobody,

01:10:13.429 --> 01:10:15.195
what you need to do
is get your basic ass

01:10:15.197 --> 01:10:16.130
- and get up outta my house.
- Basic?

01:10:16.132 --> 01:10:17.165
Who are you calling basic?

01:10:19.334 --> 01:10:20.367
- Shut up.
- if you were my boyfriend

01:10:20.369 --> 01:10:21.435
- I would beat your ass.
- Shut up.

01:10:21.437 --> 01:10:23.305
Nobody wants you.

01:10:26.475 --> 01:10:28.611
I don't even know
what to say to you.

01:10:30.479 --> 01:10:31.646
What is wrong with you?

01:10:31.648 --> 01:10:35.315
- Baby, come on.
- You've gone too far.

01:10:35.317 --> 01:10:37.185
Baby, baby look.

01:10:37.187 --> 01:10:39.020
- I'm sorry baby.
- I'm sorry.

01:10:39.022 --> 01:10:40.788
That's all you say is I'm sorry.

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:41.923
What were you gonna tell me

01:10:41.925 --> 01:10:44.226
if you'd brought our
daughter home in a body bag?

01:10:49.331 --> 01:10:50.697
I'm leaving.

01:10:50.699 --> 01:10:52.735
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:10:53.903 --> 01:10:54.904
You can't leave me.

01:11:00.043 --> 01:11:01.010
Are you baby?

01:11:03.046 --> 01:11:05.146
Know what, no, you're leavin',

01:11:05.148 --> 01:11:06.379
get your shit and get out.

01:11:06.381 --> 01:11:08.815
What, whoa babe, babe, babe,

01:11:08.817 --> 01:11:10.985
come on, you gotta talk
about this with me, come on.

01:11:10.987 --> 01:11:13.689
I don't wanna talk any more.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:16.790
You need some kind of
intervention or god

01:11:16.792 --> 01:11:18.059
I don't know.

01:11:18.061 --> 01:11:21.430
You're not gonna be satisfied
until we're broke or dead.

01:11:22.431 --> 01:11:24.898
- What, baby.
- Did you get your job back?

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.535
Yeah, kind of.

01:11:29.239 --> 01:11:31.239
What do you mean, kinda?

01:11:31.241 --> 01:11:33.039
I'm working with the FBI now.

01:11:33.041 --> 01:11:36.843
Nigga, I'm not stupid, you
don't just get in like that.

01:11:36.845 --> 01:11:40.180
Baby, come on, look,
just feel me out, okay?

01:11:40.182 --> 01:11:41.249
You know.

01:11:41.251 --> 01:11:44.317
No, I can't do this anymore.

01:11:44.319 --> 01:11:45.418
But babe, we got
a baby on the way...

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:46.722
Don't touch me.

01:11:48.056 --> 01:11:49.288
Kayla?

01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:50.459
Leave Elijah.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.795
Kayla.

01:11:54.029 --> 01:11:54.863
Go.

01:12:04.673 --> 01:12:08.608
Girl, you handled
yourself like a queen.

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:10.376
I'm gonna go ahead
and get outta here

01:12:10.378 --> 01:12:12.581
and bitch, call me
if you need me, okay?

01:12:14.348 --> 01:12:19.554
Take that, bye Boo.

01:12:45.646 --> 01:12:47.047
What you doing Jas?

01:12:47.049 --> 01:12:50.085
Just playing with my toys,
you wanna play with me?

01:12:51.352 --> 01:12:53.385
Actually, Daddy has to leave.

01:12:53.387 --> 01:12:54.789
Where you're going?

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:57.857
I don't know, I might
go stay with Uncle Max

01:12:57.859 --> 01:12:59.425
for a little while.

01:12:59.427 --> 01:13:01.995
Did you make Mommy mad again?

01:13:01.997 --> 01:13:06.465
I guess I did, huh.

01:13:06.467 --> 01:13:08.469
But I don't want you to leave.

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:10.803
I don't wanna leave either,

01:13:10.805 --> 01:13:14.140
but I love you too
much to stay right now.

01:13:14.142 --> 01:13:15.541
And I know you don't understand,

01:13:15.543 --> 01:13:19.246
but I'll be back to check
up on you, I promise.

01:13:19.248 --> 01:13:20.679
Okay?

01:13:20.681 --> 01:13:23.684
All right, give Daddy a big
hug so I can get outta here.

01:13:25.853 --> 01:13:27.588
Be good to your Mom.

01:15:48.728 --> 01:15:50.997
Mother fucker.

01:16:07.013 --> 01:16:09.080
You know, I appreciate
you allowing me to use

01:16:09.082 --> 01:16:10.647
your couch tonight.

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:12.052
Kayla was still trippin'.

01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:16.320
See I
told your black ass

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:17.822
my cousin don't play.

01:16:17.824 --> 01:16:20.992
See that's what happens when
you don't listen to your boy.

01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:22.994
Anyway, I'm gonna catch
up with you later man,

01:16:22.996 --> 01:16:25.329
I'm gonna hit up this
car meet in Long Beach.

01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:29.102
Oh, and by the way, here's some
lotion if you feel the urge.

01:16:30.103 --> 01:16:31.335
Man, if you don't get
this thing outta here,

01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:33.603
I'm still with my lady, aight.

01:16:33.605 --> 01:16:34.941
Not tonight.

01:16:50.256 --> 01:16:51.322
Hello.

01:16:51.324 --> 01:16:52.490
What do you have?

01:16:52.492 --> 01:16:53.990
I heard about the
incident today.

01:16:53.992 --> 01:16:54.958
I got nothing.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.127
Well I do.

01:16:56.129 --> 01:16:57.228
This man is a wanted
serial killer.

01:16:57.230 --> 01:16:58.995
The old Jeffrey Dahmer type,

01:16:58.997 --> 01:17:01.299
except he's
ex-military personnel.

01:17:01.301 --> 01:17:04.601
He was dishonorably discharged
almost 20 years ago now.

01:17:04.603 --> 01:17:06.903
Somehow he was released
on good behavior.

01:17:06.905 --> 01:17:08.274
Oh, serial killer ay.

01:17:09.608 --> 01:17:12.376
That must explain those
head shots at his apartment.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:13.544
You got that right.

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:14.711
There's no telling what
this man's capable of.

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:16.746
In his mind, he's right.

01:17:16.748 --> 01:17:18.148
Well, as of right now,

01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:19.749
we don't know where he is or
where his whereabouts are,

01:17:19.751 --> 01:17:23.554
so I guess we have to keep
our eyes and ears open.

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:24.754
Yeah, because in this town

01:17:24.756 --> 01:17:26.758
he may very well be
right under your nose.

01:17:27.759 --> 01:17:28.794
I doubt it.

01:17:40.472 --> 01:17:41.340
Hello?

01:17:42.374 --> 01:17:44.209
Morning, you miss me?

01:17:45.344 --> 01:17:48.678
Look Elijah, I don't
have time for this, okay?

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.213
I can't do this right now.

01:17:50.215 --> 01:17:52.617
Why you just can't
say you miss me?

01:17:52.619 --> 01:17:54.619
Because you need to
be taught a lesson.

01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:55.819
And what lesson is that?

01:17:55.821 --> 01:17:57.921
That you need to
be more responsible

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.923
and put your family first.

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:01.091
What do you think
I'm out here tryna do?

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:03.693
I'm tryna give my
family the good life.

01:18:03.695 --> 01:18:06.429
We already have a good life.

01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:08.832
No ones complaining.

01:18:08.834 --> 01:18:11.700
It's you that wants a
good life for yourself

01:18:11.702 --> 01:18:14.039
and no one else around
you is good enough.

01:18:15.207 --> 01:18:18.141
Everyone's always running
around, like once I get this,

01:18:18.143 --> 01:18:21.311
once I get that,
then I'll be happy.

01:18:21.313 --> 01:18:22.711
No.

01:18:22.713 --> 01:18:24.849
Open your eyes Elijah.

01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:27.452
Be happy with right now.

01:18:28.853 --> 01:18:30.122
You know what, Kay?

01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:32.357
You're absolutely right.

01:18:34.092 --> 01:18:35.492
So what I'm gonna do,
is I'm gonna come home

01:18:35.494 --> 01:18:37.994
and Ima get my job back,

01:18:37.996 --> 01:18:40.332
I'll be a changed
me, when you see me

01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:42.998
I'm gonna be your Elijah,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.436
and you're gonna like it.

01:18:45.370 --> 01:18:47.204
I'm doing it for you and Jas,

01:18:47.206 --> 01:18:49.241
'cause I love y'all
both that much.

01:18:51.742 --> 01:18:52.977
I love you too.

01:18:54.613 --> 01:18:56.147
Now come home Daddy.

01:18:56.881 --> 01:18:58.783
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

01:18:59.884 --> 01:19:02.221
And can you bring some
juice and eggs on your way?

01:19:03.622 --> 01:19:04.922
Is that all you want?

01:19:06.224 --> 01:19:07.459
Oh my god, boy stop.

01:19:09.695 --> 01:19:11.394
Aight, I got you.

01:19:11.396 --> 01:19:12.263
Bye.

01:19:19.605 --> 01:19:20.936
Yo Max, I appreciate
you letting me

01:19:20.938 --> 01:19:22.938
stay at the crib tonight man.

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.574
I'll get you you're
mug back too.

01:19:24.576 --> 01:19:25.910
Man, fuck you.

01:19:29.548 --> 01:19:31.849
It's
gonna be a long day.

01:19:34.051 --> 01:19:36.053
What's going on in
the world today?

01:19:36.787 --> 01:19:37.920
Yo, yo, yo,

01:19:37.922 --> 01:19:40.155
you're tuning in
to 92.3 the K wave,

01:19:40.157 --> 01:19:42.958
and today is gonna be a
game between the Dodger's

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.594
and the San Francisco Giants.

01:19:44.596 --> 01:19:45.794
Hope you guys got your tickets

01:19:45.796 --> 01:19:47.029
'cause they're all
ready sold out.

01:19:47.031 --> 01:19:48.230
- Oh my god.
- Man, what you all think

01:19:48.232 --> 01:19:50.366
about this new news
now between Cardi B.

01:19:50.368 --> 01:19:53.102
She got into another
altercation with another artist.

01:19:53.104 --> 01:19:54.937
Agent Mendez, look I
need you to get everybody

01:19:54.939 --> 01:19:57.206
on high alert at the
Dodger Stadium right now.

01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:13.491
Shoot, there he
goes right there.

01:20:26.437 --> 01:20:27.937
Not this again.

01:20:28.872 --> 01:20:31.373
I'm gonna finish
this guy for good.

01:22:08.671 --> 01:22:10.438
It's over Conner,
surrender now.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.874
Ah, I'll never
surrender Detective.

01:22:12.876 --> 01:22:14.542
Look, I don't have
time for this today.

01:22:14.544 --> 01:22:17.913
I've got backup on the way
so drop your weapon now.

01:22:19.582 --> 01:22:23.950
Why don't you come out
here and face me like a man.

01:22:25.855 --> 01:22:27.054
Let's go.

01:22:27.056 --> 01:22:29.357
Lay down on the ground
and drop your weapon.

01:22:29.359 --> 01:22:31.958
Aww, you didn't really
think I'd turn myself over

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.695
that easy, did you Detective?

01:22:34.697 --> 01:22:36.299
Well that's a detonator.

01:22:37.467 --> 01:22:40.501
There's enough C4 to take
down this entire structure

01:22:40.503 --> 01:22:45.708
so I recommend, drop your weapon,
get the hell outta my way.

01:22:46.843 --> 01:22:48.543
Why you doing this?

01:22:48.545 --> 01:22:51.714
Why am I doing this?

01:22:52.715 --> 01:22:54.049
Well it's quite simple.

01:22:55.418 --> 01:22:56.386
Revenge.

01:22:57.454 --> 01:22:58.488
Justice.

01:23:00.322 --> 01:23:01.123
Pleasure.

01:23:02.257 --> 01:23:05.027
You ever have the rush of
taking a life Detective?

01:23:05.961 --> 01:23:10.098
The screams, the lovely
downpour of blood,

01:23:10.999 --> 01:23:14.468
the great taste of human flesh.

01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:19.007
You kill one, and two, and
thirst for more just builds.

01:23:20.108 --> 01:23:23.678
The stadium will be my
greatest victory of all time.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.480
No, whatever you been
through is not the fault

01:23:26.482 --> 01:23:28.148
of innocent lives.

01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:30.083
But it sure will
get the attention

01:23:30.085 --> 01:23:33.353
of those who misunderstood
and outcast me.

01:23:33.355 --> 01:23:37.624
Do you know what it's like
to be ignored Detective?

01:23:37.626 --> 01:23:38.492
No, I don't.

01:23:38.494 --> 01:23:40.062
I didn't think so.

01:23:40.996 --> 01:23:44.097
When this is over,
I'll be famous,

01:23:44.099 --> 01:23:46.166
in the minds and mouths of many.

01:23:46.168 --> 01:23:48.368
Everyone will know my name.

01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:51.371
No, you'll infamous, and
that's how you wanna go down?

01:23:51.373 --> 01:23:52.239
As a killer?

01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:53.775
Any prize is good prize.

01:23:55.177 --> 01:23:57.979
You're sick Conner,
and you need some help,

01:23:57.981 --> 01:23:59.379
let me help you.

01:23:59.381 --> 01:24:03.452
You are starting to sound
like my former comrade.

01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:08.855
You should of heard the way
that he begged me for mercy

01:24:08.857 --> 01:24:13.093
as I split his testicles.

01:24:13.095 --> 01:24:14.094
All
right, that's enough.

01:24:14.096 --> 01:24:15.328
Get down on the ground now.

01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:18.965
No, you drop your
weapon Detective.

01:24:18.967 --> 01:24:20.034
Drop it.

01:24:25.574 --> 01:24:26.475
Attaboy.

01:24:32.347 --> 01:24:34.113
So I guess you're
ready to die, huh?

01:24:36.518 --> 01:24:37.519
We'll see.

01:25:05.881 --> 01:25:07.179
Ready to fuckin' die?

01:25:17.759 --> 01:25:19.592
You're going down.

01:25:19.594 --> 01:25:20.796
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:25:26.167 --> 01:25:27.368
Delicious.

01:25:53.694 --> 01:25:56.230
It's over Conner,
you're under arrest.

01:26:04.405 --> 01:26:06.171
Even if you did put
an end to this job

01:26:06.173 --> 01:26:09.510
there would still be an
explosive after party.

01:26:10.411 --> 01:26:12.011
You got another bomb?

01:26:12.013 --> 01:26:14.179
Bingo.

01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:16.915
There is only one other
local division I despise.

01:26:16.917 --> 01:26:20.221
When was the last time you
took out your trash Detective?

01:26:21.255 --> 01:26:22.921
You devil.

01:26:22.923 --> 01:26:25.791
No, but I do work for him.

01:26:25.793 --> 01:26:26.725
Don't do this.

01:26:26.727 --> 01:26:27.528
- Good bye.
- No.

01:26:33.701 --> 01:26:36.267
Max, how'd you find me?

01:26:36.269 --> 01:26:38.437
You know I still got
those police scanners?

01:26:38.439 --> 01:26:40.439
Heard your name and
the nearest location.

01:26:40.441 --> 01:26:42.074
What I'm tryna figure
out is how I got here

01:26:42.076 --> 01:26:43.207
before they did.

01:26:43.209 --> 01:26:45.411
Damn, they're still slow
to save black people

01:26:45.413 --> 01:26:47.211
if you're one of them.

01:26:47.213 --> 01:26:48.416
Man, shut up.

01:26:49.249 --> 01:26:51.182
I think there's another bomb.

01:26:51.184 --> 01:26:52.885
What, where?

01:26:52.887 --> 01:26:54.352
I don't know man.

01:26:54.354 --> 01:26:56.889
Last thing he said was
something about a trash can.

01:26:56.891 --> 01:26:59.792
You think he can put the
bomb inside your house?

01:26:59.794 --> 01:27:03.327
Oh god, please don't say
that Max, don't say that Max.

01:27:03.329 --> 01:27:04.529
Oh my god, I can't
live with that.

01:27:04.531 --> 01:27:07.132
Look, we gotta go, we
gotta go now, come on.

01:27:11.471 --> 01:27:12.638
Oh shoot.

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.605
Dog, we gotta go back
man, I forgot the C4, man,

01:27:14.607 --> 01:27:16.175
I don't know where
he place it at man...

01:27:16.177 --> 01:27:18.177
Chill, chill, I took
care of it all ready, man,

01:27:18.179 --> 01:27:19.544
I grabbed the bomb in his car,

01:27:19.546 --> 01:27:21.612
it was down the street from
where you guys where at.

01:27:21.614 --> 01:27:22.848
Where is it?

01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:24.116
Oh, it's in the trunk.

01:27:24.118 --> 01:27:26.018
You got the C4 in the trunk?

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.251
Yes nigga, in the trunk.

01:27:27.253 --> 01:27:28.653
Oh my god.

01:27:28.655 --> 01:27:30.288
You know what, I can't even
think about this right now,

01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:32.191
I need to call Kayla, come
one, let me see your phone.

01:27:32.193 --> 01:27:33.524
Why nigga, where's your phone?

01:27:33.526 --> 01:27:34.726
I don't know, I
think I dropped it

01:27:34.728 --> 01:27:35.861
chasing these goons
or something man,

01:27:35.863 --> 01:27:36.997
just let me see the phone.

01:27:41.267 --> 01:27:42.500
What do you want?

01:27:42.502 --> 01:27:44.368
Hey Kayla, what's
up baby, look, look,

01:27:44.370 --> 01:27:45.603
look, I know you're
mad, but look,

01:27:45.605 --> 01:27:47.005
you gotta do what
I tell you, okay?

01:27:47.007 --> 01:27:49.874
Look, I don't have time
for games right now Elijah,

01:27:49.876 --> 01:27:51.275
I'm about to hang up this phone.

01:27:51.277 --> 01:27:53.845
No, no, no, no, whatever
you do, do not hang up.

01:27:53.847 --> 01:27:57.015
I'm tired of your
lies, what do you want?

01:27:57.017 --> 01:27:57.984
Where's Jasmine?

01:28:03.690 --> 01:28:05.556
Okay look, I know this
is gonna sound crazy,

01:28:05.558 --> 01:28:07.024
but you gotta get Jasmine,

01:28:07.026 --> 01:28:09.060
and get up out the house.

01:28:09.062 --> 01:28:10.530
Why, Elijah?

01:28:11.498 --> 01:28:15.032
Baby, there's a
bomb in the trash can.

01:28:15.034 --> 01:28:16.033
Okay, now you've
really lost it,

01:28:16.035 --> 01:28:18.336
you need to be checked out.

01:28:18.338 --> 01:28:20.905
I know, look, I know it
sounds crazy baby, look,

01:28:20.907 --> 01:28:22.440
but you think I would make
up somethin' like this?

01:28:22.442 --> 01:28:25.109
Listen to the sound
of my voice, okay?

01:28:25.111 --> 01:28:27.578
I need you to go
get our baby girl

01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.783
and get up out
the house, please?

01:28:32.852 --> 01:28:33.720
My ball.

01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:39.791
Jasmine, get
away from that trash can.

01:28:39.793 --> 01:28:41.692
Is everything okay?

01:28:51.838 --> 01:28:53.807
Yeah,
everything's fine.

01:28:55.742 --> 01:28:58.075
Okay, I'm sorry
baby, love you,

01:28:58.077 --> 01:28:59.545
I'll be home shortly, okay?

01:29:01.214 --> 01:29:02.081
I love you.

01:29:04.449 --> 01:29:07.051
What's up man,
everything cool?

01:29:07.053 --> 01:29:08.820
Yeah, everything's cool man.

01:29:08.822 --> 01:29:10.387
Nothin' happened.

01:29:10.389 --> 01:29:11.991
So where is this second bomb?

01:29:13.293 --> 01:29:15.126
I don't know man, think
that fool was lyin'.

01:29:15.128 --> 01:29:16.459
Yeah, let me take
you to your car.

01:29:16.461 --> 01:29:19.130
Nah, nah, nah, don't
take me to the home man,

01:29:19.132 --> 01:29:20.097
just take me by
the precinct, man,

01:29:20.099 --> 01:29:21.700
I gotta go back and get my job.

01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:24.838
Good call.

01:29:36.381 --> 01:29:37.649
Lieutenant.

01:29:38.517 --> 01:29:39.986
I've been lookin' for you.

01:29:41.321 --> 01:29:42.989
What's up Elijah?

01:29:47.026 --> 01:29:49.128
I wanna apologize, you know,

01:29:50.929 --> 01:29:51.997
maybe you were right.

01:29:53.465 --> 01:29:55.400
Maybe I'm not FBI material.

01:29:56.102 --> 01:29:57.669
Maybe I'm nowhere near ready.

01:29:59.538 --> 01:30:01.807
Maybe I'm just
wild and reckless.

01:30:02.941 --> 01:30:07.278
I hear it from you and I
hear it from the ones I love.

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.414
Glad you finally
had your awakening.

01:30:12.017 --> 01:30:15.752
I got the call about you
taking out that terrorist too

01:30:15.754 --> 01:30:18.590
that you've been so adamant
about, congratulations.

01:30:20.726 --> 01:30:23.762
Yeah, I took a hit,
but I took him out too.

01:30:24.763 --> 01:30:27.699
So, you think they
gonna let you in now?

01:30:29.034 --> 01:30:30.834
I don't even know, honestly,

01:30:30.836 --> 01:30:33.505
I don't even know if I wanna
be an FBI agent no more.

01:30:34.806 --> 01:30:36.339
So you know, I was hoping,
maybe you could give me

01:30:36.341 --> 01:30:37.408
my job back.

01:30:38.677 --> 01:30:41.747
You're reckless, disastrous,

01:30:42.748 --> 01:30:44.983
a danger to innocent civilians,

01:30:48.552 --> 01:30:50.856
actually, you destroy
everything you touch.

01:30:51.757 --> 01:30:53.659
I mean, I wouldn't
say all that.

01:30:54.726 --> 01:30:56.028
But it's true though.

01:30:56.929 --> 01:30:58.462
So, no.

01:30:59.698 --> 01:31:01.733
Elijah, I can't give
you your job back.

01:31:02.734 --> 01:31:07.103
However, why don't you
take some time off man?

01:31:07.105 --> 01:31:12.510
Really self evaluate, spend
some time with your family.

01:31:13.211 --> 01:31:13.812
I'll grant you pay leave.

01:31:16.714 --> 01:31:18.614
Guess that's better
than nothing, right?

01:31:18.616 --> 01:31:21.418
Yeah, so be thankful.

01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.553
Now go home.

01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:26.356
Think I'll do that.

01:31:26.358 --> 01:31:27.223
No worries.

01:31:27.225 --> 01:31:28.557
Thanks Lieutenant.

01:31:28.559 --> 01:31:29.827
No problem.

01:31:31.696 --> 01:31:34.665
Oh, you do me one
favor, one favor,

01:31:35.666 --> 01:31:38.101
could you please take
my trash to the garbage?

01:31:38.103 --> 01:31:39.635
I don't know what's
wrong with our janitor.

01:31:39.637 --> 01:31:41.204
Did you just say trash?

01:31:41.206 --> 01:31:42.638
Yeah.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.840
There is only one other
local division I despise,

01:31:44.842 --> 01:31:48.111
when was the last time you
took out your trash Detective?

01:31:52.783 --> 01:31:54.850
Where the main trash at?

01:31:54.852 --> 01:31:55.720
Shit.

01:31:58.556 --> 01:32:00.423
Oh Elijah, why you dragging
me out here in the heat,

01:32:00.425 --> 01:32:02.392
my leg hurt, I think
I twisted my ankle,

01:32:02.394 --> 01:32:04.595
I ain't walking
all day, it's hot.

01:32:16.607 --> 01:32:18.107
Oh my god, is that
what I think it is?

01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:20.242
Damn right it is
what you think it is.

01:32:20.244 --> 01:32:22.711
Oh, come on.

01:32:22.713 --> 01:32:24.646
Okay, all right, you gotta
get the hell outta here,

01:32:24.648 --> 01:32:25.814
you're not even
suppose to be here.

01:32:25.816 --> 01:32:26.949
What are you gonna
do, call the bomb unit?

01:32:26.951 --> 01:32:28.283
You do realize there's
only five minutes

01:32:28.285 --> 01:32:29.284
on this thing, right?

01:32:29.286 --> 01:32:30.487
Shit.

01:32:30.489 --> 01:32:32.621
All right, Elijah,
you gotta leave,

01:32:32.623 --> 01:32:33.689
you're not suppose to be here.

01:32:33.691 --> 01:32:34.523
- Get the hell outta here.
- No, no, no,

01:32:34.525 --> 01:32:35.524
I'm staying man.

01:32:35.526 --> 01:32:36.925
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

01:32:36.927 --> 01:32:38.327
No, no, no, Lieutenant,
look, you're trippin', look,

01:32:38.329 --> 01:32:40.429
maybe we could just put this
bomb inside this thing, right,

01:32:40.431 --> 01:32:41.930
it's metal, I'm sure
we could fuse it down

01:32:41.932 --> 01:32:44.133
- or something like that.
- Elijah, no.

01:32:44.135 --> 01:32:45.100
It won't diffuse it.

01:32:45.102 --> 01:32:46.635
Now there's hundreds of
people on the inside,

01:32:46.637 --> 01:32:49.104
this thing blows, everybody
will be dead, okay?

01:32:49.106 --> 01:32:51.106
- All right, look, just...
- What are you doing?

01:32:51.108 --> 01:32:51.940
Okay, I'm gonna cut the

01:32:51.942 --> 01:32:53.175
- case open.
- You're gonna do what?

01:32:53.177 --> 01:32:54.476
Remember, I used to
do this for a living,

01:32:54.478 --> 01:32:55.244
- now just...
- Bro, that was over

01:32:55.246 --> 01:32:56.478
10 years ago.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.713
I know how long
it was, all right?

01:32:57.715 --> 01:32:58.914
Just get the hell out
of here, all right,

01:32:58.916 --> 01:33:00.849
don't make me cut you,
all right, come on.

01:33:00.851 --> 01:33:02.583
This dude is
about to cut a bomb.

01:33:02.585 --> 01:33:04.019
- Just the casing.
- Oh my gosh,

01:33:04.021 --> 01:33:06.088
oh god, I'm sorry, whatever
I did please forgive me

01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:07.722
'cause I'm about to die,
I'm about to come see you

01:33:07.724 --> 01:33:08.689
sooner than I thought.

01:33:08.691 --> 01:33:10.492
Hey, hey, can I focus please?

01:33:10.494 --> 01:33:12.727
Thank you, this is a bomb, okay?

01:33:12.729 --> 01:33:14.129
You sure you know
what you're doing?

01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:18.534
I can focus if you shut
the hell up, all right?

01:33:18.536 --> 01:33:20.002
I have
a woman and a girl

01:33:20.004 --> 01:33:22.271
- and your about to cut a bomb.
- Shut up,

01:33:22.273 --> 01:33:24.239
I know you have kids.

01:33:24.241 --> 01:33:25.606
Oh my god.

01:33:25.608 --> 01:33:26.709
I have to focus.

01:33:28.745 --> 01:33:31.848
Ah, okay, I'll pass you here,

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:34.349
I think I found it,
I think I found it.

01:33:34.351 --> 01:33:36.617
Just, all right man, if I die,

01:33:36.619 --> 01:33:37.486
I'm gonna kill you,

01:33:37.488 --> 01:33:38.353
- okay?
- You're right,

01:33:38.355 --> 01:33:39.223
I get it, I get it.

01:33:40.357 --> 01:33:41.225
Okay.

01:33:42.992 --> 01:33:43.860
Do it.

01:33:46.363 --> 01:33:49.300
Oh shit.

01:33:50.301 --> 01:33:51.167
Oh shit.

01:33:52.303 --> 01:33:53.768
Don't scare me
like that again.

01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:57.406
Oh my god dude, oh
my god, you did it.

01:33:57.408 --> 01:33:59.073
I guess, I guess I still got.

01:33:59.075 --> 01:34:01.075
You damn right you
still got it man.

01:34:01.077 --> 01:34:02.444
I'm
glad you found it

01:34:02.446 --> 01:34:03.678
otherwise we'd
all been dead man,

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.349
you saved a lot of lives today.

01:34:06.584 --> 01:34:08.182
Look man, I gotta go man,

01:34:08.184 --> 01:34:09.384
I got a wifey waitin' on me.

01:34:09.386 --> 01:34:10.785
Look, I thank you
for the vacation

01:34:10.787 --> 01:34:12.120

that man, all right?

01:34:12.122 --> 01:34:14.590
Look, you got it man, look,
just don't bring your ass

01:34:14.592 --> 01:34:15.990
back here till I call you.

01:34:15.992 --> 01:34:16.657
I'm out.

01:34:16.659 --> 01:34:17.994
Yeah, be out.

01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:23.733
Sims, do me a favor
and call the unit.

01:34:24.602 --> 01:34:25.833
Yeah, the bomb
unit, just send them

01:34:25.835 --> 01:34:28.002
to the back of the building.

01:34:28.004 --> 01:34:30.805
Don't question, just
send me the damn unit.

01:34:30.807 --> 01:34:35.011
Yeah and Sims, bring
me some cigarettes.

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:48.091
You missed breakfast.

01:34:49.225 --> 01:34:50.760
Yeah, I know I did.

01:34:52.661 --> 01:34:54.164
How's Jas, what's she up to?

01:34:55.265 --> 01:34:56.799
She's in her room, asleep.

01:34:57.699 --> 01:34:59.169
Look, baby,

01:35:00.436 --> 01:35:01.569
I know you don't
wanna hear this,

01:35:01.571 --> 01:35:04.472
but I'm sorry, I'm
sorry 'bout everything.

01:35:04.474 --> 01:35:06.374
I been doing a whole
lot of thinking

01:35:06.376 --> 01:35:11.314
and I think I'm gonna let
this whole FBI thing alone.

01:35:12.915 --> 01:35:15.516
No dream is worth me
loosing my family.

01:35:15.518 --> 01:35:16.386
Stop.

01:35:18.021 --> 01:35:19.855
I'm not gonna let you do that.

01:35:20.756 --> 01:35:22.824
I know how hard you
worked for this.

01:35:23.992 --> 01:35:26.728
Max and your lieutenant called
me to explain everything.

01:35:27.597 --> 01:35:28.464
Lieutenant?

01:35:30.766 --> 01:35:33.134
Yeah, you either got
an angel on your side

01:35:33.136 --> 01:35:34.270
or your lyin'.

01:35:35.405 --> 01:35:38.738
Come on, you know I got
some angels on my side.

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:40.310
I know,

01:35:41.877 --> 01:35:42.742
but I forgive you..

01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:50.284
I missed you so much.

01:35:50.286 --> 01:35:51.686
It's only been a day.

01:35:51.688 --> 01:35:54.122
I know, but I can't
live without you.

01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:58.392
Ah, baby, my arm.

01:35:58.394 --> 01:36:00.329
I'm sorry, big baby.

01:36:02.297 --> 01:36:04.498
Lieutenant told you
about my leave of absence?

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:07.234
He did, what are you gonna do?

01:36:07.236 --> 01:36:08.368
Let's go to Jamaica.

01:36:08.370 --> 01:36:10.003
You, me and Jas, come on.

01:36:10.005 --> 01:36:10.804
What?

01:36:10.806 --> 01:36:12.205
We're going to Jamaica?

01:36:12.207 --> 01:36:15.342
Yeah, come on, pack up,
we're going to Jamaica.

01:36:15.344 --> 01:36:16.577
Okay, I'm down with that.

01:36:16.579 --> 01:36:18.311
- Aiight.
- Yeah.

01:36:18.313 --> 01:36:21.381
Then I'll go get our passports
outta the closet then.

01:36:21.383 --> 01:36:22.918
All right baby.

01:36:46.408 --> 01:36:47.274
Hello.

01:36:47.276 --> 01:36:48.774
Wilkins.

01:36:48.776 --> 01:36:50.145
Agent Mendez.

01:36:51.213 --> 01:36:52.912
Nice work out
there, but not exactly

01:36:52.914 --> 01:36:55.017
the way we handle
things around here.

01:36:57.386 --> 01:37:00.687
Okay, so
what are you saying?

01:37:00.689 --> 01:37:01.990
I'm saying you're in.

01:37:03.425 --> 01:37:05.191
Come on, stop playing.

01:37:05.193 --> 01:37:07.329
I pulled some
strings and got you in.

01:37:08.764 --> 01:37:10.796
You're officially with the FBI.

01:37:10.798 --> 01:37:12.666
And just in time for the
next training session

01:37:12.668 --> 01:37:14.869
at Quantico next
week, can you make it?

01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:21.940
You know, actually
I'm gonna decline that

01:37:21.942 --> 01:37:23.310
next training session.

01:37:23.312 --> 01:37:25.844
But the next one's not
for another month or so.

01:37:25.846 --> 01:37:27.382
Yeah I know, but,

01:37:28.883 --> 01:37:31.152
I got something worth
the wait right now.

01:37:32.454 --> 01:37:35.388
All right, well you

01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:36.756

Ah, I do all right.

01:40:17.450 --> 01:40:19.584
It's been long time,
with Jas and everything,

01:40:19.586 --> 01:40:22.220
and work and all that,
but got some time off,

01:40:22.222 --> 01:40:24.756
figured I'd take
care of my lady.

01:40:24.758 --> 01:40:25.858
I appreciate it.

01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.327
You know I do.

01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:32.430
What, why are you
lookin' at me like that?

01:40:32.432 --> 01:40:34.634
What, I
can't look at my lady?

01:40:36.336 --> 01:40:38.569
Stop, you're making my blush.

01:40:38.571 --> 01:40:40.906
You know I love
it when you blush.

01:40:40.908 --> 01:40:42.373
Oh, you like that, huh?

01:40:42.375 --> 01:40:43.643
Yeah.

01:40:46.779 --> 01:40:48.212
Hey, you remember that girl

01:40:48.214 --> 01:40:50.717
from back in the day, Veronica?

01:40:52.652 --> 01:40:54.085
Wait, wait, Veronica?

01:40:54.087 --> 01:40:55.720
- Yes.
- What about her?

01:40:55.722 --> 01:40:57.955
You know she
had a crush on you right?

01:40:57.957 --> 01:41:00.258
Oh my gosh, stop playing.

01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:01.993
Okay, I never told you this,

01:41:01.995 --> 01:41:04.295
but one night I
was at your house

01:41:04.297 --> 01:41:07.198
and there was a
knock on the door.

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.401
You were in the bathroom
so I went and answered it.

01:41:10.403 --> 01:41:13.371
When I opened the door,
it's Veronica standing

01:41:13.373 --> 01:41:15.640
in the middle of the rain
with a box of cookies

01:41:15.642 --> 01:41:17.308
I'm assuming were for you.

01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:19.109
Okay,
so what'd you do?

01:41:19.111 --> 01:41:20.545
I snatched those
cookies from her,

01:41:20.547 --> 01:41:25.115
told her you weren't home, and
slammed the door in her face.

01:41:25.117 --> 01:41:28.486
What do you think?

01:41:28.488 --> 01:41:30.555
Hold on, wait a
minute, 'cause I know you.

01:41:30.557 --> 01:41:31.556
What?

01:41:31.558 --> 01:41:32.625
Did you eat them
cookies though?

01:41:34.192 --> 01:41:35.258
I had a few.

01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:36.563
- Oh my goodness.
- A few.

01:41:37.597 --> 01:41:40.065
Look, she wasn't about
to have my man, okay?

01:41:41.099 --> 01:41:43.366
Aren't you
a little territorial?

01:41:43.368 --> 01:41:44.234
- Yeah.
- Excuse me ma'am,

01:41:44.236 --> 01:41:45.368
welcome to Treys,

01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:46.637
can I offer you some wine?

01:41:46.639 --> 01:41:47.705
None for me thank you.

01:41:47.707 --> 01:41:49.576
I'll take some, thank you.

01:41:50.710 --> 01:41:51.578
Thank you.

01:41:52.812 --> 01:41:55.613
So, how are you feeling.

01:41:55.615 --> 01:41:59.984
You start your first official
day as an agent tomorrow,

01:41:59.986 --> 01:42:01.052
this is big.

01:42:01.054 --> 01:42:02.254
Yes it is.

01:42:03.221 --> 01:42:04.554
That's why I feel
like I made one of

01:42:04.556 --> 01:42:06.391
the greatest breakthroughs
of my life, I mean,

01:42:07.092 --> 01:42:08.427
except for you and Jas.

01:42:09.796 --> 01:42:12.364
But, it's almost indescribable.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.166
I wanna thank you.

01:42:16.168 --> 01:42:18.002
I put you through a lot, baby.

01:42:18.004 --> 01:42:20.370
I did a lot of crazy stuff,

01:42:20.372 --> 01:42:22.006
a lot of stupid stuff actually,

01:42:22.008 --> 01:42:24.008
but you still by my side,

01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:27.112
and I'll always
love you for that.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:31.450
Elijah, I love you and I
will always be there for you.

01:42:32.551 --> 01:42:34.753
I know baby, you
don't have to tell me.

01:42:36.655 --> 01:42:37.789
This is why.

01:42:38.757 --> 01:42:40.624
What are you doing?

01:42:40.626 --> 01:42:43.195
I'd like to know
if you'll marry me?

01:42:44.496 --> 01:42:46.730
Oh my god Elijah,
yes I will marry you.

01:42:46.732 --> 01:42:47.931
You gonna marry me?

01:42:47.933 --> 01:42:49.901
- Yes.
- Let's do it babe.

01:42:53.238 --> 01:42:54.971
She said yes,
y'all, she said yes.

01:43:01.046 --> 01:43:02.881
To a long, loving marriage.
