WEBVTT

00:04.330 --> 00:06.230
It is our civic duty

00:06.270 --> 00:07.362
to mold New York into a city

00:07.400 --> 00:09.368
that matches _our
highest aspirations.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.162
And your thoughtful

00:11.210 --> 00:12.609
and passionate contribution
to that effort

00:12.640 --> 00:14.608
only strengthens
my commitment.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.608
Thank you.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.470
And_t_hen I'll announce_
my deCI5ion and any clapping

00:18.510 --> 00:20.341
will be drowned out by the boos.

00:21.580 --> 00:24.219
The right decision isn't always
the most popular one, Scott.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.786
I hope I didn't teach you that.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.458
Earliest night you've
knocked off this week.

00:27.490 --> 00:28.457
Where am I taking you?

00:28.490 --> 00:29.821
Home, Larry.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.091
Good night, Suzy.

00:38.670 --> 00:40.831
LARRY: Commissioner?
It's me, Larry.

00:40.870 --> 00:43.202
We have that _
announcement this morning.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.332
I'm here to pick you up.

00:55.350 --> 00:57.682
Mr. Standley!

00:59.790 --> 01:01.815
Varick!

01:01.860 --> 01:03.748
Hey, Varick,
come back here!

01:03.790 --> 01:06.452
You thought you could
get away from me.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.362
(children chattering
and yelling)

01:23.180 --> 01:25.273
Hey, it's
Super Memory Woman!

01:25.310 --> 01:26.538
Oh...!

01:27.550 --> 01:29.415
Okay. Hello!

01:29.450 --> 01:31.281
Oh, no, no.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.753
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

01:32.790 --> 01:35.452
Okay, now!

01:35.490 --> 01:37.526
Oh...

01:37.560 --> 01:39.221
tricky, triclq.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.227
Are you ready for this?

01:40.260 --> 01:41.522
Here we go.
Yep.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.460
Eli, Clara,

01:43.500 --> 01:45.229
Derrick, Braden,

01:45.270 --> 01:47.397
Hailey, Luca, Diego,

01:47.440 --> 01:48.691
Violet, Jude,

01:48.740 --> 01:50.367
Shana, Jackson,

01:50.410 --> 01:52.298
Franny, Noah,

01:52.340 --> 01:53.329
Zoe...

01:53.380 --> 01:54.438
and...

01:54.480 --> 01:55.606
I'm...

01:55.640 --> 01:57.176
Lulu!

01:57.210 --> 01:58.507
Are you a witch?

01:58.550 --> 02:00.245
That would depend on
who you ask.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.218
My phone's ringing.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.478
Go play, you guys.
Have fun.

02:05.550 --> 02:07.313
Hey.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.487
(officer shouting orders,
siren walls in distance)

02:09.530 --> 02:10.929
You're nuts running
on a day like this.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.450
Ever heard of
heat stroke?

02:12.500 --> 02:14.627
I barely got started running
before you called me

02:14.660 --> 02:16.890
and I'm trying to
beat my 10K record.

02:16.930 --> 02:18.568
Proving what, exactly?

02:18.600 --> 02:20.329
Proving that
I'm better now

02:20.370 --> 02:22.258
than I was in 1993.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.732
Just competing
against yourself.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.533
Yeah, well, you got to
beat the best to be the best.

02:25.570 --> 02:27.879
All right, our victim is
Scott Sta ndley,

02:27.910 --> 02:29.571
Zoning Board Commissioner.

02:29.610 --> 02:30.702
That's a powerful
position.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.274
Yet I never
heard of him.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.538
You have anything on him
in that head of yours?

02:35.750 --> 02:37.286
No. I'm drawing
a total blank.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.187
See? Running in this heat's
melting your brain.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.280
I don't know...

02:45.330 --> 02:46.422
Standley's aide,
Larry Borman,

02:46.460 --> 02:49.793
discovered the body
about 8:30 am.

02:49.830 --> 02:52.867
He got in using a key
Standley had given him.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.436
No sign of forced entry.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.461
I'm thinking our victim
let his killer in.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.660
CARRIE:
All right.

03:00.910 --> 03:03.299
Have we cleared the aide?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.442
Ah, claims he was with
his girlfriend

03:04.480 --> 03:05.606
on let Street all night.

03:05.650 --> 03:06.378
Murray's
looking into it.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.479
Looks like two shots
to the chest;

03:08.520 --> 03:10.715
used a pillow
to muffle the sound.

03:13.590 --> 03:15.911
CARRIE:
5,000-piece puzzle.

03:22.930 --> 03:25.569
Learning Portuguese.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.261
I don't know,
the...

03:27.300 --> 03:28.699
puzzle, the cat,

03:28.740 --> 03:31.265
learning a new language...

03:31.310 --> 03:33.904
seems like a lonely guy
looking for a distraction.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.538
I know you're all wondering
ifI hit my trips, boys,

03:42.590 --> 03:43.614
but...

03:43.650 --> 03:46.653
you're gonna have to pay
to find out.

03:57.770 --> 03:58.964
Something?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.729
Hmm?

04:00.770 --> 04:02.829
No. Nothing.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.724
So, the aide's alibi
holds up.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.819
Girlfriend and the doorman
confirm his story.

04:24.860 --> 04:26.396
You track Standley's
movements yesterday?

04:26.430 --> 04:28.955
He went in to the ofﬁce
at 8:00 in the morning,

04:29.000 --> 04:30.820
worked late with his staff,
went home.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.838
They say he seemed upset,
worried about anything?

04:32.870 --> 04:33.859
Not anything
out of the ordinary.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.936
His wife just passed
from cancer ten months ago,

04:35.970 --> 04:37.062
so he'd been pretty down.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.737
I didn't see any cameras

04:38.770 --> 04:39.873
in the lobby
of Standley's building.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.878
What about
out on his street?
Nothing.

04:41.910 --> 04:43.673
But I'm all over
his cell records.

04:43.710 --> 04:44.745
Maybe we'll get luclq.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.577
Jay!

04:46.620 --> 04:47.712
What do you got?

04:47.750 --> 04:49.479
Got a bio on the guy,
not much else.

04:51.490 --> 04:52.787
Meet Scott Standley, 42,

04:52.820 --> 04:54.356
Zoning Board Commissioner
for New York City.

04:54.390 --> 04:55.459
Served under
the last four mayors

04:55.490 --> 04:56.923
in some capacity.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.689
Before he
worked for the city,

04:58.730 --> 05:00.789
he ran a non-profit
for underprivileged kids.

05:00.830 --> 05:03.094
Violent end
for a do

05:04.530 --> 05:06.066
I did look into
some of Standley's

05:06.100 --> 05:07.829
recent work decisions.

05:07.870 --> 05:08.962
Just last week,
he approved this community park

05:09.000 --> 05:10.001
up in the Bronx.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.632
Grass for the community,

05:11.670 --> 05:13.979
playgrounds for the kids...
but yes,

05:14.010 --> 05:15.637
$20 million in billings

05:15.680 --> 05:17.807
to the contractor
who won the bid.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.772
So, a guy creates a windfall
for winning bidders

05:19.820 --> 05:22.345
and bad feelings
for those he passes on.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.709
Big money, big motive.

05:23.750 --> 05:27.550
Okay. Standley made three
personal phone calls yesterday

05:27.590 --> 05:29.080
on his cell phone,
all to the same number...

05:29.120 --> 05:30.621
a burner cell.

05:30.660 --> 05:31.979
I'm trying to track it.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.624
Why is a successful
political like this guy

05:34.660 --> 05:35.752
living in a tiny apartment

05:35.800 --> 05:37.461
and making calls
to burner cells?

05:37.500 --> 05:38.819
It doesn't track.

05:38.870 --> 05:40.565
I mean, get into
his finances,

05:40.600 --> 05:41.760
check his emails, threats,

05:41.800 --> 05:44.860
disgruntled colleagues,
anything.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.908
Hey.

05:50.950 --> 05:51.871
Hi.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.116
How's it coming?

05:53.150 --> 05:55.710
Fine. Um...
I think everything's

05:55.750 --> 05:56.910
pretty straightforward.

05:56.950 --> 05:58.417
I'll put the time of death

05:58.450 --> 06:00.384
at about 1:00 am.
I sent you the report.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.888
Yeah, no, I-I got it,
I just, uh...

06:04.160 --> 06:06.594
You know, I was just wondering
if there was anything else

06:06.630 --> 06:07.949
that maybe, you know...
Is everything all right?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.662
Can't a person
just drop by anymore?

06:10.700 --> 06:12.930
A person can, but you can't.

06:12.970 --> 06:14.892
Okay.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.669
The truth is...

06:16.710 --> 06:17.904
I need your advice.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.908
Oh, it's about the
Secret Service guy.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.908
You've been dating
a few months,

06:21.940 --> 06:23.771
he's throwing around
the "E" word.

06:23.810 --> 06:25.141
Well, honestly,
if you ask me,

06:25.180 --> 06:26.875
exclusivity is overrated.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.740
I was dating a guy, he was

06:28.780 --> 06:30.486
a trustee at the
children's zoo

06:30.520 --> 06:32.078
and he said,
"Baboons have it down.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.452
"The females just go out

06:34.490 --> 06:36.924
"and expose their tushes
to the troops

06:36.960 --> 06:38.621
and the troops
bow down and applaud..."
No. No. Jo. Jo.

06:38.660 --> 06:41.959
My issue isn't
the Secret Service guy.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.821
M-My issue is that I, uh...

06:44.870 --> 06:46.428
I knew our victim.

06:46.470 --> 06:47.437
You knew him?

06:47.470 --> 06:48.596
Yeah.
How?

06:48.640 --> 06:51.507
Well, I met him
about four months ago,

06:51.540 --> 06:52.734
he said his
name was Marty.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.928
I didn't sleep with him.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.939
Um, we were engaged in...

06:59.980 --> 07:01.516
a game of chance.

07:01.550 --> 07:02.949
You're gambling.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.082
I thought you stopped.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.747
I did.
But I started again.

07:05.790 --> 07:07.985
And anyway, you know,
we didn't really
talk or anything.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.989
I mean, he just sat
across the poker table
from me and...

07:11.030 --> 07:12.895
Have you told Al?

07:12.930 --> 07:14.852
No.
Mm-hmm.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.527
No. I needed your advice first.
What do I do?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.891
Really, we don't know
if that has

07:18.930 --> 07:20.158
anything to do with
the investigation.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.931
Exactly-- and so why would I go
and tell Al and get him mad...?

07:23.970 --> 07:24.766
No, but it might.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.699
My advice would be
to run with it.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.901
The killer's out there,
suppose he kills again?

07:29.950 --> 07:32.100
Right.
So I should definitely

07:32.150 --> 07:34.641
tell Al, then, right?

07:35.950 --> 07:38.817
So, this guy Standley
was basically Mr. Clean.

07:38.850 --> 07:41.216
Murray's going over his
phone records, online history...

07:41.260 --> 07:43.455
but there's nothing.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.784
He wasn't dating anybody.

07:45.830 --> 07:46.956
No evidence of drug use.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.992
Are you even
listening to me?

07:50.030 --> 07:52.123
I met Standley
gambling...

07:52.170 --> 07:53.592
at a card room
on the Upper West Side

07:53.640 --> 07:54.959
about four months ago.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.661
I recognized him
when I saw his dead body.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.029
You were playing poker?

07:58.070 --> 07:59.537
Yes.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.036
And I know I told you
I would quit

08:01.080 --> 08:02.638
and I did,
I did for a while.

08:02.680 --> 08:03.999
For a while?
Are you forgetting

08:04.050 --> 08:05.642
what it took _
to cover your ass last time

08:05.680 --> 08:06.908
No. I know.
in Chinatown?

08:06.950 --> 08:07.917
If Tom Stoddard hadn't
owed me a favor...

08:07.950 --> 08:08.939
I appreciate that!

08:08.980 --> 08:10.845
Oh, well, not enough
that you would stop doing it.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.039
It's because I'm weak

08:12.090 --> 08:13.853
and reckless.
Selfish.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.016
And selﬁsh.
Stupid.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.652
Self-destructive.
I'm not stupid.

08:16.690 --> 08:18.521
Yeah, stupid.
And you're my partner.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.152
You're compromising
an investigation.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.020
I know.
And I have put you

08:22.060 --> 08:23.766
in an impossible situation

08:23.800 --> 08:25.062
and I'm gonna fix it.
I'm gonna fix it

08:25.100 --> 08:26.533
because I'm gonna
talk to Eliot, okay?

08:26.570 --> 08:27.798
He's gonna go ballistic.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.538
you ever have with him.
Yeah, I know.

08:31.570 --> 08:34.232
Okay. I'll go with you.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.168
No. I don't want to
compromise you any more

08:36.210 --> 08:37.746
than I already have.
I'm gonna go on my own,

08:37.780 --> 08:39.008
I'm a big girl,
I'm just gonna...

08:39.050 --> 08:40.074
face the music.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.678
What are you gonna say?

08:41.720 --> 08:43.688
All right. Okay.
Here it is.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.689
Scott Standley was gambling
in underground casinos.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.551
Okay. You believe...

08:48.590 --> 08:49.921
this is connected to

08:49.960 --> 08:51.086
why he was murdered?

08:51.130 --> 08:53.223
I'm not sure.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.558
Okay, why do I have
the odd feeling

08:55.600 --> 08:56.589
that there's something more?

08:56.630 --> 08:59.121
Well, I know this...

08:59.170 --> 09:00.330
well, because I remember him

09:00.370 --> 09:01.689
from one of the casinos.

09:01.740 --> 09:03.708
One of those...

09:03.740 --> 09:05.708
casinos that you, yourself...

09:05.740 --> 09:07.071
were gambling at?

09:07.110 --> 09:09.237
Yes.
I see.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.669
What exactly do you
expect me to do

09:11.710 --> 09:12.711
with this information?

09:12.750 --> 09:14.012
I, I thought you should know.

09:14.050 --> 09:15.938
You... thought I should know...

09:15.980 --> 09:17.880
that one of my detectives,

09:17.920 --> 09:19.148
a New York City police officer,

09:19.190 --> 09:21.988
working in the
Major Crimes Bureau,

09:22.020 --> 09:24.352
an officer sworn
to uphold the law...

09:24.390 --> 09:25.687
was committing a felony?

09:25.730 --> 09:27.197
Here's the thing:
w-we need to

09:27.230 --> 09:28.857
investigate gambling
as a lead

09:28.900 --> 09:31.721
and I thought
you should know the basis...

09:31.770 --> 09:33.294
of that investigation...
Thank you.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.967
You can go now.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.309
So, you don't have anymore
questions for me about,

09:37.340 --> 09:38.807
you know, maybe
how often I gamble?

09:38.840 --> 09:39.704
If it's maybe, a problem for me?

09:39.740 --> 09:40.968
Do I win much?_
Because I always Win...

09:41.010 --> 09:42.602
I most certainly
do not have

09:42.650 --> 09:44.106
any more questions
like that.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.710
I do, however,
have one question,

09:46.750 --> 09:49.173
which I will ask again:

09:51.290 --> 09:52.814
Sure.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.657
Are you mad?

09:55.860 --> 09:57.157
I'm not...

09:57.190 --> 09:58.282
Okay.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.122
Hey, Al...

10:03.170 --> 10:05.695
Commissioner Standley's
bank records.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.266
Now, this guy's been
draining his accounts

10:07.300 --> 10:08.631
over the last nine months.

10:08.670 --> 10:09.568
Downsized apartments

10:09.600 --> 10:11.204
from the Upper West Side
to Alphabet City.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.003
If he was corrupt,

10:13.040 --> 10:14.177
he sure as hell _
wasn't too good at it.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.098
He made some pretty huge
withdrawals, too.

10:16.140 --> 10:18.677
Look, $3,000 on one day,
$5,000 on another.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.041
What's he doing with that cash?

10:20.080 --> 10:23.015
Loneliness can be a gateway
to all sorts of vices.

10:23.050 --> 10:25.018
If we find out where
his money was gomg,

10:25.050 --> 10:27.086
I bet we find out
why he was killed.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.156
Hey. It turns out Standley had a
sizeable life insurance policy

10:29.190 --> 10:30.748
from the city-- and get this:

10:30.790 --> 10:32.826
he changed his beneficiary
three weeks ago.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.122
Who's getting the money?

10:34.160 --> 10:36.025
Standley's assistant...

10:36.060 --> 10:38.722
...Suzy Houchen.
Oh...

10:38.770 --> 10:40.795
Lonely widower makes
his beautiful assistant

10:40.840 --> 10:42.091
his beneficiary

10:42.140 --> 10:43.767
and three weeks later,
he's killed.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.165
Well, maybe Suzy got tired of
answering the phones.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.200
SUZY:
It's crazy.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.071
We were all just here.

10:51.110 --> 10:54.409
I feel like he's gonna walk
right through that door.

10:54.450 --> 10:57.681
AL: There was no one he was
particularly at odds With?

10:57.720 --> 11:00.257
Nothing he was working on
recently that went south?

11:00.290 --> 11:02.315
Look, it's city politics,

11:02.360 --> 11:03.952
of course there was
disagreements,

11:03.990 --> 11:06.857
but people loved
working with Scott.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.721
He was fair and
people respected that.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.967
Did he change at all,
after his wife died?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.729
Did his behavior_become
more erratic?

11:14.770 --> 11:16.806
No. Nothing like that.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.467
Um... he worked more
after Colleen died.

11:18.510 --> 11:21.729
And do you think he used his
influence for personal profit?

11:21.780 --> 11:23.873
No. No way.

11:23.910 --> 11:26.708
A company lobbying to
build a factory in Queens

11:26.750 --> 11:29.139
sent over a bouquet after
his wife's funeral and...

11:29.180 --> 11:31.216
and he made me send it back.
He was incorruptible.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.979
That would
strike me as odd,

11:33.020 --> 11:34.988
that he would make you his
life insurance beneficiary

11:35.020 --> 11:36.248
three weeks
before he was killed.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.178
What are you
talking about?

11:38.230 --> 11:40.391
You didn't know?

11:40.430 --> 11:42.318
All $200,000 is yours.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.999
No. I...

11:45.030 --> 11:46.122
I know that
he doesn't have a family,

11:46.170 --> 11:47.194
but that's incredibly weird.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.265
He didn't say a word.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.235
Maybe the lonely widower
was starting to look at you

11:52.270 --> 11:53.237
in a more personal way.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.032
Al...

11:55.080 --> 11:56.945
He was more like
a brother.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.800
You two spent
a lot of time together,

11:58.850 --> 11:59.919
feelings build...

11:59.950 --> 12:01.144
Al.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.169
Suzy, we-we
believe you.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.847
Do you know where he went
when he wasn't working?

12:05.890 --> 12:07.983
Larry would know.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.750
Larry Borman, his aide.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.929
They spent a lot more time
outside of the office.

12:12.960 --> 12:13.699
Excuse me.
Sure.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.959
Why'd you step on
my affair angle?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.126
I was getting signals
from her.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.331
You were getting signals
from her

12:21.370 --> 12:23.201
Were you also getting signals
from her wife?

12:24.240 --> 12:25.867
Yeah.

12:28.510 --> 12:30.307
Sure, I picked him up

12:30.350 --> 12:31.806
in the mornings
sometimes.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.147
Took him to meetings.

12:33.180 --> 12:34.875
Once in a while,
I'd drive him home.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.171
You ever drive him
anywhere else?

12:36.220 --> 12:37.448
No, not really.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.242
You know, he lived
a pretty simple life.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.882
After Colleen died,
he'd pretty much been

12:40.920 --> 12:42.114
keeping to himself.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.479
Yeah.
I understand that.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.521
After my husband passed,
I kept to myself, too.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.994
Sometimes you get lonely.

12:48.030 --> 12:49.793
You need something
to fill that void.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.127
I know I did.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.865
I did some things
I wasn't too proud of.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.367
You see any of that behavior
in Mr. Standley?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.061
Hey, look,
it wasn't a big deal,

12:56.100 --> 12:57.931
but in the last couple of
months before he died,

12:57.970 --> 12:59.369
he started having me
take him to bars.

12:59.410 --> 13:02.174
Larry, was there one bar
in particular you took him to?

13:02.210 --> 13:04.201
Yeah. Lonnegan's
on the Lower East Side.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.376
He started having me
drop him there

13:05.410 --> 13:07.173
a couple months ago.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.209
Okay. When was the last time
you took him to Lonnegan's?

13:08.250 --> 13:09.239
Two nights ago.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.815
*

13:17.090 --> 13:18.557
All the bars in New York,

13:18.590 --> 13:21.058
and this is where
Standley came to unwind?

13:21.100 --> 13:23.159
Yeah, well, you forgot your
skinny jeans and your moustache.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.559
Is drinking beer out of
a can a thing again?

13:26.600 --> 13:29.569
Haven't seen that since
Cavanaugh's, back in Syracuse.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.306
Tuesday night PBRs led to an

13:31.340 --> 13:33.069
epic game of truth or dare.

13:33.110 --> 13:34.134
You won.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.240
Turned out we could
sneak into the ladies' room

13:37.280 --> 13:38.304
and go undetected.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.578
I think we both won.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.942
For 11 mind-blowing minutes.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.580
AL:
I thought it was longer.

13:50.190 --> 13:51.327
AL:
Our victim was
Scott Sta ndley,

13:51.360 --> 13:53.499
Zoning Board Commissioner.

13:53.530 --> 13:54.952
No sign of forced entry...

13:55.000 --> 13:56.820
Interesting.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.603
Okay, listen, I just saw a guy
who used a pocket watch

14:03.640 --> 14:05.505
to gain access
to the back room.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.337
Now Standley had the
exact same watch

14:07.380 --> 14:08.369
in his apartment.

14:08.410 --> 14:09.502
_ He wasn't _
coming here to drink.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.178
You think there's
a casino in there?

14:11.210 --> 14:12.245
Yeah, I do.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.872
And he was here the night
before he was killed.

14:13.920 --> 14:14.978
I gotta get in there.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.248
Don't even
think about it.
Why?!

14:16.280 --> 14:18.089
We-we could go in
and check things out

14:18.120 --> 14:19.314
from the inside._
We can't just go in

14:19.350 --> 14:20.908
and shut it down,
'cause we're not gonna

14:20.960 --> 14:23.053
learn anything that way.
You really think Eliot's

14:23.090 --> 14:25.285
gonna let you go undercover
at an underground casino?

14:25.330 --> 14:26.649
Sure. Of course.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.021
It's a brilliant idea.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.391
How could he say no?

14:29.430 --> 14:30.522
No.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.061
Look, we tracked Standley
to an underground casino.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.260
The same one you saw him in?

14:34.300 --> 14:36.495
One I haven't been to.
Oh, imagine that.

14:36.540 --> 14:37.234
His aide confirmed he was there

14:37.270 --> 14:39.135
the night before
he was murdered.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.104
Now I've been digging around
and I've got some contacts

14:41.140 --> 14:42.676
who say Standley
was asking for a big loan.

14:42.710 --> 14:44.109
AL:
He was asking loan sharks

14:44.150 --> 14:46.505
for $180,000.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.677
So, we're thinking
either he lost money gambling,

14:48.720 --> 14:51.018
took out a big loan
and he couldn't repay it,

14:51.050 --> 14:53.280
or he pissed off the wrong guy
at the card table.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.151
So we go undercover
at the casino--

14:55.190 --> 14:56.157
we find the killer.

14:56.190 --> 14:57.418
Right...

14:57.460 --> 14:58.484
Well, I mean,

14:58.530 --> 15:01.419
in order for that
to really work,

15:01.460 --> 15:04.588
my God, a person
would have to have

15:04.630 --> 15:07.098
built up a lot of cred...

15:07.140 --> 15:09.131
gambling at...
Oh.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.307
such establishments.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.102
That's a year ago.

15:11.140 --> 15:12.061
The Chanel is a little
out of style,

15:12.110 --> 15:14.635
but I do think,
I do think you'd pull it off.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.999
Oh, thank you very much.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.473
How did you get...?
You don't really think

15:17.510 --> 15:18.670
I was gonna hire you two

15:18.710 --> 15:21.440
without doing
my research, did you?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.586
This one, oh, look,
four months ago.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.440
That's the warehouse
down on Grover.

15:26.490 --> 15:29.357
Yeah, it's Fulton, actually,
and I am very flattered

15:29.390 --> 15:31.051
that you've been
spying on me.

15:31.090 --> 15:33.422
Relax, Wells.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.451
I'm just keeping tabs
on my dream team.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.991
What do you have on Al?

15:38.030 --> 15:40.134
Al? Uh... you know, well,

15:40.170 --> 15:41.398
four unpaid parking tickets

15:41.440 --> 15:43.135
outside the same
curry house

15:43.170 --> 15:44.364
in Astoria.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.263
And I seem to recall

15:45.310 --> 15:49.508
an unlicensed woodworking
class in Dumbo.

15:49.540 --> 15:50.507
Yawn.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.369
Life in the fast lane, huh?

15:51.410 --> 15:53.412
I made a magazine rack.

15:53.450 --> 15:54.417
Mahogany.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.338
I trust...

15:56.380 --> 15:58.382
that you understand the blowback
that could come down

15:58.420 --> 15:59.580
on this unit if others

15:59.620 --> 16:01.485
from City Hall
or the department

16:01.520 --> 16:03.249
find out about
your little habit?

16:03.290 --> 16:04.723
You found out about
my little habit

16:04.760 --> 16:06.728
and y haven't
fired me yet, why?

16:06.760 --> 16:08.421
Really?

16:08.460 --> 16:09.597
I mean, would you fire you?

16:09.630 --> 16:11.120
No.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.991
You're going undercover.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.064
Yes!

16:15.100 --> 16:16.567
Both of you.
Oh.

16:25.350 --> 16:26.499
Oh, look at that.

16:29.550 --> 16:31.415
Here's_ the deal:
ifI Win again,

16:31.450 --> 16:32.747
I don't have to
wear this necklace.

16:32.790 --> 16:34.519
Carrie, if you don't wear
the necklace camera,

16:34.560 --> 16:35.709
we can't see what's happening
inside the casino.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.456
Jay, if I do wear
the necklace camera,

16:38.490 --> 16:40.629
I run the risk of looking like a
real housewife of Beverly Hills.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.252
This thing is huge.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.267
I bought a necklace
just like that

16:43.300 --> 16:44.665
a few years ago,
for my sister,

16:44.700 --> 16:46.292
and she loved it.
Ah, that's
very, very cute

16:46.330 --> 16:47.490
that you still
believe that. Hey.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.734
AL:
Hey.

16:48.770 --> 16:51.204
Murray got a tip
on this loan shark.
Mm!

16:51.240 --> 16:53.105
AL: Dean Gray
from West Orange.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.439
Multiple arrests and he may be
working inside this casino.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.175
CARRIE: All right,
are you ready?

16:58.210 --> 16:59.507
Three of diamonds,
jack of spades,

16:59.550 --> 17:00.710
four of hearts,
ten of clubs,

17:00.750 --> 17:02.445
seven of spades.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.243
Damn. I_'ve_seen her use
her friggin' memory

17:04.290 --> 17:06.110
a million times
and she still hustles me.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.219
Okay.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.455
Now...

17:09.490 --> 17:11.082
now with both of you
wearing your cameras,

17:11.130 --> 17:12.722
we'll be able to_see
what you're domg,

17:12.760 --> 17:15.752
I.D. whoever's inside
the casmo, all right?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.826
And you... are gonna teach me
how to do this one day.

17:18.870 --> 17:20.098
Over a beer.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.767
Fair enough.
I'll buy.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.836
All right.
Good luck, guys.

17:23.870 --> 17:26.100
Listen, got us
into the casino,

17:26.140 --> 17:27.437
we're all good.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.209
I had my bookie Zeke
vouch for us.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.470
You got a bookie named Zeke
who vouches for you?

17:31.510 --> 17:33.410
Yeah. I told him you were
my new sugar daddy,

17:33.450 --> 17:35.611
so you should start
practicing your part.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.083
Who's your old sugar daddy?

17:37.120 --> 17:39.384
Wouldn't you
like to know.
Yeah.

17:39.420 --> 17:41.718
Let me ask you, do you moonlight
as a gambler or as a cop?

17:41.760 --> 17:43.853
I am not... a gambler.

17:43.890 --> 17:46.154
Gamblers lose, I win.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.226
Hmm.
Hmm. Cute.

17:48.260 --> 17:50.296
CARRIE:
Ooh, nice "murse," Eliot.

17:50.330 --> 17:51.627
You want to pass
as a high roller,

17:51.670 --> 17:53.865
you have to bet
like a high roller.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.629
Oop...
Ow!

17:55.670 --> 17:56.694
No catnip for kitty.

17:57.370 --> 17:58.769
You're the bank.

17:58.810 --> 18:01.472
Huh. Put the responsible one
in charge-- that's smart.

18:01.510 --> 18:03.501
Wait a second, I'm the one
playing at the big table.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.700
Precisely, if you
have a cold night,

18:05.750 --> 18:07.672
I can trust A! not
to lose all that cash.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.870
I can't even tell you what
I did for the commissioner

18:09.920 --> 18:11.217
for him to okay this.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.184
We won't ask, you don't tell.

18:14.190 --> 18:15.714
The cash comes back--

18:15.760 --> 18:17.250
every penny of it.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.689
Oh, yeah, and um...

18:20.730 --> 18:22.698
it'd also be nice if you found
Standley's killer.

18:26.470 --> 18:28.734
They're heading in.

18:28.770 --> 18:31.136
*

18:33.840 --> 18:36.274
Hey. How you doing?

18:41.320 --> 18:43.880
CARRIE:
Hmm.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.715
SECURITY GUARD:
This way.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.113
Oh.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.755
Ooh...

18:52.790 --> 18:54.189
Step inside.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.198
State your name.

18:56.230 --> 18:57.322
Oh, thank you.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.630
A photo booth! Hmm!

19:01.670 --> 19:04.309
Well, this is cool.

19:06.870 --> 19:07.837
Come on.
All right.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.542
Here we go.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.445
Charles Newman,
Sydney Campbell.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.869
Smile, Charlie.

19:17.220 --> 19:18.289
Oh!

19:18.320 --> 19:19.287
Good evening.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.958
Hi.

19:20.990 --> 19:21.957
Wow.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.629
*

19:24.660 --> 19:26.287
Nice place.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.820
Yeah...
I can see the allure.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.851
Okay.
Roulette for you,

19:29.900 --> 19:32.391
red and black--
you can handle that.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.658
WOMAN:
Hi.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.464
Sydney, Charlie,
I'm Molly, your hostess.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.298
Zeke tells me your lady's
quite a player, Charlie.

19:39.340 --> 19:40.534
She does okay.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.468
Well, this
is quite something.

19:42.510 --> 19:44.546
I mean, I've been in
a lot of card rooms,

19:44.580 --> 19:45.877
but never one like this.

19:45.910 --> 19:48.572
I think you'll see,
we cater to a higher-end player

19:48.620 --> 19:50.986
than the other rooms in town.

19:51.020 --> 19:52.817
We offer all the games:

19:52.850 --> 19:54.215
Blackjack, craps,
roulette

19:54.260 --> 19:56.353
and of course, poker.

19:56.390 --> 19:57.857
Sydney, I already placed you
on the wait-list

19:57.890 --> 19:58.652
for the high-stakes table.

19:58.690 --> 20:00.521
Thank you.
How is the action tonight?

20:00.560 --> 20:02.892
Mmm, some loose
players, some tight.

20:02.930 --> 20:04.659
You might have
your hands full.

20:04.700 --> 20:05.860
I think I'll manage.

20:05.900 --> 20:06.889
She's trying to
work on her confidence.

20:08.470 --> 20:09.937
Well, I aim to pamper our VIPs,

20:09.970 --> 20:12.006
so please let me know if there's
anything I can do for you.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.007
CARRIE:
Thank you.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.008
She's perlq.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.837
Keep it in
your holster, Charlie.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.678
Sir.

20:21.580 --> 20:22.672
All right,
here we go.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.687
My pleasure.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.915
Thank you.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.259
Tonight's gonna be fun.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.382
Mm-hmm.

20:29.420 --> 20:30.387
I'm gonna win.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.352
Okay.

20:32.390 --> 20:33.857
Yay!

20:33.900 --> 20:36.551
No... you gotta earn your
allowance with me, Sydney.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.922
I give you money
in exchange for some sugar.

20:39.970 --> 20:40.994
That's how these
relationships work.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.564
Oh...

20:45.770 --> 20:47.579
You owe me back pay...

20:47.610 --> 20:49.407
Daddy.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.873
"Daddy."

20:50.910 --> 20:52.946
Really?

20:54.780 --> 20:56.611
How they doing?

20:56.650 --> 20:57.878
Boss, I've got
facial recognition

20:57.920 --> 20:58.784
working overtime.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.378
This place is not lacking
in suspects.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.854
Most of the security guards
have sheets.

21:02.890 --> 21:04.949
Well, it takes a criminal
to run a criminal operation.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.629
Now, Carrie's got to
watch out for this guy

21:07.660 --> 21:09.491
when she sits down
at the poker table.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.299
Alexander Sapic.

21:12.330 --> 21:13.638
Serbian mobster.

21:13.670 --> 21:14.898
Suspected of
dismembering a guy

21:14.940 --> 21:17.636
after he took him for
big cash in Monte Carlo.

21:17.670 --> 21:19.467
Charming guy. Who's that

21:19.510 --> 21:21.375
Al's taken an interest in?

21:21.410 --> 21:23.708
JAY: Oh, that's...
Molly McGintee.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.002
I think she's
the hostess or something.

21:26.050 --> 21:27.312
Smart kid.

21:27.350 --> 21:28.544
Was a student at
Stern Business School,

21:28.580 --> 21:29.877
but dropped out
about three years ago.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.979
Good job.
Keep me posted.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.885
Will do. _
It's pretty rislq busmess,

21:33.920 --> 21:35.319
huh, boss?

21:36.420 --> 21:38.752
You can say that again.

21:38.790 --> 21:40.758
And then there's
Al and Carrie to worry about.

21:43.700 --> 21:44.894
All right.

21:46.530 --> 21:47.690
CARRIE:
Whoa. There's cold

21:47.740 --> 21:48.934
and then there's you.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.437
How many 15's
can they give me?

21:51.910 --> 21:53.332
Book says to hit against a face.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.905
I keep telling you,
I play my gut.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.669
Yes and the casino
really appreCIates that.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.445
That's 20 for you, sir.

22:00.480 --> 22:01.344
Ah, there we go.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.018
All right.
Yeah.

22:03.050 --> 22:04.984
I'm gonna double down.
Showoff.

22:05.020 --> 22:05.782
Good luck.

22:07.050 --> 22:07.812
21. Again.

22:09.060 --> 22:09.958
Must be my luclq night.

22:09.990 --> 22:11.719
All right.

22:12.990 --> 22:14.855
You know what, let-let's
take a little break.

22:14.900 --> 22:15.924
MAN:
That's a good idea.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.791
So, you're the
redheaded card counter

22:17.830 --> 22:18.899
I've heard rumors about.

22:18.930 --> 22:20.659
Card counter?

22:20.700 --> 22:21.997
Are you crazy?

22:22.040 --> 22:24.031
Who could possibly count
against, what, four decks?

22:24.070 --> 22:24.900
You'd be the first
I've seen.

22:24.940 --> 22:27.636
Time to move on
from blackjack, Sydney.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.635
Ah, you really
want to cut her off

22:28.680 --> 22:29.999
before she
gives it all back?

22:30.040 --> 22:33.043
Mr. Newman, we're happy
to have you continue playing.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.911
Yeah.
Sydney?

22:34.950 --> 22:37.418
I have a seat ready for you
at the poker table.

22:37.450 --> 22:40.385
Well, she still has
poker privileges, right?

22:40.420 --> 22:41.717
Of course.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.011
Behave, Charlie.

22:43.060 --> 22:44.652
Mm-hmm.

22:44.690 --> 22:46.419
Good luck.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.553
Luck.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.568
Who said anything
about luck?

22:52.030 --> 22:54.669
My lady knows her way
around a casino,

22:54.700 --> 22:55.894
Mr., uh...

22:55.940 --> 22:57.464
Gray.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.738
I sense we're not
the first

22:58.770 --> 23:00.476
she's taken
a bundle off of.

23:00.510 --> 23:02.728
So that's one of the reasons
we're here tonight.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.441
She took a guy big
couple weeks ago

23:04.480 --> 23:05.742
at another room in town.

23:05.780 --> 23:07.042
Hoping to get
another shot at him.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.139
Goes by "Marty."
You know him?

23:09.180 --> 23:11.148
I'm not too good with names...

23:11.190 --> 23:12.714
Charlie.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.460
Trying to buy
a pot off me again?

23:41.680 --> 23:44.148
I'm out.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.817
Wise move, sweet cheeks.

23:45.850 --> 23:47.010
Hmm.

23:52.590 --> 23:54.421
Thank you, Carrie.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.089
Who... are... you?

24:02.140 --> 24:04.108
Hurry up, guy.

24:04.140 --> 24:05.630
Move on me or tuck your tail.

24:05.670 --> 24:08.002
Fine, Germ.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.031
I'm all-in.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.781
DEALER:
Two pair-- aces and jacks.

24:25.990 --> 24:26.957
Flush wins.

24:26.990 --> 24:30.027
I'm cleaned out.

24:33.100 --> 24:36.592
Mr. Zager would like to
speak to you on the telephone.

24:39.540 --> 24:40.871
This way.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.813
* Got a meth lab zoso sticker
rolled up in my pocket *

24:48.850 --> 24:49.976
* Got a seven-inch
trigger finger *

24:50.020 --> 24:51.282
* Don't know how to stop it

24:51.320 --> 24:53.083
* Got a one-way pile driver

24:53.120 --> 24:55.111
* Nowhere left to use it

24:55.160 --> 24:57.116
* I'm a super-charged
freedom fighter *

24:57.160 --> 24:59.628
* And I'm giving it all...

25:00.900 --> 25:02.151
* Get it up...

25:04.300 --> 25:05.665
* Get it up...

25:07.230 --> 25:08.834
* Get it up!

25:16.940 --> 25:19.602
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.911
Whoa...

25:24.250 --> 25:25.217
She's good.

25:25.250 --> 25:27.115
Oh, the kid's good.

25:30.660 --> 25:31.888
Ah, look who's back.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.956
With a nice marker
for the rest of us to win.

25:47.310 --> 25:50.177
Men's room's on the
other side of the floor.

25:51.310 --> 25:52.174
I need a marker.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.610
Like the one you gave
that guy over there.

25:54.650 --> 25:58.040
Only Mr. Zager approves markers.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.752
I just dropped a European
sports car on your tables,

26:00.790 --> 26:03.759
least they can do is give me
a chance to win it back.

26:06.830 --> 26:08.229
Thank you for your trouble.

26:19.670 --> 26:22.207
Hey, Murray,
I got a favor to ask.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.902
I need your Bureau buddies
to run a name for me.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.269
I only got a last name "Zager,"

26:26.310 --> 26:28.039
but it seems like he's the juice
behind the casino.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.274
All right, I'm on it.

26:31.890 --> 26:34.154
We can't float you anything
at this time.

26:34.190 --> 26:38.388
Mr. Zager only offers markers
to those he knows.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.227
Please enjoy a cocktail
on the house.

26:40.260 --> 26:42.296
So kind of you.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.318
Fine, Germ.

27:01.350 --> 27:02.271
I'm all-in.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.085
DEALER :
Two pair-- aces and jacks.

27:06.120 --> 27:09.009
You're awful anxious for someone
who's not in the game.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.678
Hmm.
You got a big mouth.

27:12.730 --> 27:16.359
I mean... it's pretty
but... it's big.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.197
Apparently, you've been
paying more attention

27:18.230 --> 27:20.266
to my mouth
than you have to your cards,

27:20.300 --> 27:21.892
which is why
I've been carding you up.

27:27.070 --> 27:29.129
All-in.

27:30.380 --> 27:31.904
Call.

27:36.050 --> 27:38.041
Straight don't
beat a boat.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.751
I busted you again, Donkey.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.191
You... certainly...

27:49.230 --> 27:50.891
got his number...

27:50.930 --> 27:51.965
don't you?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.126
Run away
while you're ahead?

27:53.170 --> 27:54.239
That's real classy.

27:54.270 --> 27:56.329
You know what I call it?

27:56.370 --> 27:57.906
Real smart.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.302
Hi, Charlie.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.329
The guy must've
lost 80 grand.

28:03.380 --> 28:05.177
Yeah. Like Standley.

28:05.210 --> 28:06.438
He never had a chance.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.869
The whole game is fixed.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.410
I'm cashing out.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.799
So, I know Carrie thinks
the poker game is rigged, but...

28:20.830 --> 28:22.388
what's the guy's signal?

28:22.430 --> 28:24.125
The cards or the player
they're targeting.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.365
Someone was spotting his
cards behind the table.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.789
All right, but then
how did Carrie take Germ down?

28:28.840 --> 28:30.808
Nobody was spotting her cards,
he had no advantage.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.307
Pretty ballsy move--

28:32.340 --> 28:35.138
two guys running a card scam
in front of Dean.

28:35.180 --> 28:38.047
Which is why we think
they work for the casino.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.843
They're targeting individuals
and bleeding 'em.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.142
What'd you find?

28:41.180 --> 28:44.047
Well... Lonnegan's

28:44.090 --> 28:47.014
is owned by a dummy corporation
called the Foxriver Group.

28:47.050 --> 28:49.450
Sunglasses guy is
Kirby Monroe.

28:49.490 --> 28:50.889
Got a couple charges
for robbery.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.420
Seems to work card rooms
around the East Coast.

28:52.460 --> 28:53.449
And Germ?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.889
This is an interesting fellow,
Chuck Thornton.

28:56.930 --> 28:58.363
Got a perfect score
on his LSAT's,

28:58.400 --> 28:59.469
Columbia Law School,

28:59.500 --> 29:01.229
but this guy's
a two-time loser.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.329
Got pinched for
falsifying pick-six bets

29:03.370 --> 29:05.167
from the Breeder's Cup
back in 2006;

29:05.210 --> 29:06.905
Served 37 months.

29:06.940 --> 29:08.931
Hey, guys. A buddy of mine
at the Bureau

29:08.980 --> 29:11.244
just sent this over
on the money guy Zager.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.840
Now, the name Zager showed up
in the gambling scene

29:13.880 --> 29:15.939
a few years ago, but nobody's
got anything on him.

29:15.980 --> 29:17.345
Not even a country of origin.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.211
What about the guy they
cleaned out

29:19.250 --> 29:21.081
Yes. Will Olden,

29:21.120 --> 29:23.850
32, lawyer,
lives in Park Slope.

29:23.890 --> 29:25.778
Made about $150 K last year.

29:25.830 --> 29:27.957
His only client
is the estate of a dead guy.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.353
Here's what I got
on the estate.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.890
Okay, so,

29:30.930 --> 29:32.898
Olden loses
almost an entire year's salary

29:32.930 --> 29:34.795
at the poker table last night.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.092
Why extend a marker
to a guy who can't pay it back?

29:37.140 --> 29:38.505
It doesn't make sense.

29:38.540 --> 29:40.269
It does to someone.

29:43.380 --> 29:45.541
How is it we both
stayed up all night

29:45.580 --> 29:47.502
and you look amazing
and I look like hell?

29:47.550 --> 29:50.110
Practice.
And genetics.

29:50.150 --> 29:51.947
In terms of
Eliot's money,

29:51.990 --> 29:52.911
were we up for the night?

29:52.950 --> 29:54.212
We?
You do know

29:54.260 --> 29:56.285
blackjack is played
to 21, right?

29:56.320 --> 29:58.550
Thank you. And all night
I thought it was 15.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.854
So we looked into
this guy Olden...

30:00.900 --> 30:02.993
Coffee?
Sure.

30:03.030 --> 30:04.463
...who lost big at poker.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.229
Strange thing is

30:06.270 --> 30:09.194
he's a small-time lavwer
without deep pockets,

30:09.240 --> 30:10.901
and still they gave him
this big marker.

30:10.940 --> 30:13.204
Huh.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.038
Same profile as Standley.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.968
Maybe they set him up, too.

30:18.010 --> 30:19.841
Well, why fix games
against people

30:19.880 --> 30:22.019
who borrow money from you
who can't pay you back?

30:22.050 --> 30:23.369
Ooh.

30:23.420 --> 30:25.047
No good, huh?
Mm-mm.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.285
What does the guy
do for a living?

30:27.320 --> 30:28.981
Represents the estate
of some dead guy

30:29.020 --> 30:31.250
who owned run-down
buildings in Red Hook.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.882
Donald Trump, he isn't.

30:32.930 --> 30:34.898
Red Hook...

30:34.930 --> 30:36.852
SUZY :
Look, it's city politics.
Of course

30:36.900 --> 30:39.164
there was disagreements,
but everyone loved

30:39.200 --> 30:40.929
working with Scott.
He was fair

30:40.970 --> 30:42.597
and people respected that.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.904
I may have something.

30:45.940 --> 30:47.635
Standley was working

30:47.670 --> 30:49.069
on the subway
expansion project

30:49.110 --> 30:50.941
in Red Hook,
deciding on stops.

30:50.980 --> 30:52.948
I saw the map
in his office.

30:52.980 --> 30:55.869
He was choosing between Wolcott
Street and Carroll Street.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.047
The property
near the new subway stop

30:58.090 --> 30:59.387
will suddenly
become a gold mine.

30:59.420 --> 31:01.183
Jay, where are
the buildings that

31:01.220 --> 31:03.017
Olden represented
in Red Hook?

31:03.060 --> 31:04.084
Uh, hold on a sec.

31:05.690 --> 31:08.591
Okay, here we go-- Olden's
client's biggest property

31:08.630 --> 31:09.995
was an abandoned warehouse
on Wolcott Street.

31:10.030 --> 31:11.292
That's the play.

31:11.330 --> 31:13.491
They weren't looking
to get paid back in money.

31:13.530 --> 31:15.998
They wanted Standley
to rule in their favor

31:16.040 --> 31:18.099
on the subway expansion.

31:18.140 --> 31:19.562
Which, if they own
the right property,

31:19.610 --> 31:22.170
is a hell of a lot more valuable
than any gambling debt.

31:22.210 --> 31:23.973
I don't know, that seems like
an awful lot of work.

31:24.010 --> 31:24.999
Why not just bribe the guy?

31:25.050 --> 31:27.200
Standley's assistant
said he was incorruptible.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.411
But once the casino
got their hooks into him,

31:29.450 --> 31:31.111
he had no choice.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.185
The assistant was right.

31:32.220 --> 31:33.983
Standley's not corrupt,

31:34.020 --> 31:35.282
he's a gambling addict, right?

31:35.320 --> 31:36.582
So they lure him in,

31:36.620 --> 31:38.281
and then once they
get him in debt,

31:38.330 --> 31:40.059
they use their leverage

31:40.090 --> 31:42.456
to make him choose
Wolcott Street.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.968
But then why kill the guy
before he's made his decision?

31:50.470 --> 31:53.030
He ha made a decision.

31:53.070 --> 31:55.277
I saw it circled on the map
in his office.

31:55.310 --> 31:57.335
He chose Carroll Street.

31:57.380 --> 31:59.439
So he decides to go
with his conscience,

31:59.480 --> 32:02.040
even if it means screwing
the Foxriver guys.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.480
So they kill him,
but they still go forward

32:04.520 --> 32:06.385
trying to acquire
Olden's property.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.149
They must think they can get
Standley's replacement

32:08.190 --> 32:09.452
to go their way.

32:09.490 --> 32:11.981
Right. They bet on Wolcott.

32:12.030 --> 32:14.021
Jay, look into
the local holdings

32:14.060 --> 32:15.288
of Foxriver Group.

32:15.330 --> 32:16.991
Okay.

32:17.030 --> 32:18.463
Okay, we got two properties,

32:18.500 --> 32:20.627
both purchased
within the last three weeks.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.160
Both buildings
on Wolcott Street.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.033
Okay, can you find any names
on these property deals?

32:26.410 --> 32:27.707
Just the one:

32:27.740 --> 32:29.173
Dean Gray.

32:31.410 --> 32:33.378
Uh, just because you think you
know why Standley was murdered,

32:33.410 --> 32:35.048
doesn't mean we can prove it.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.219
If we go marching in there
without the complete picture,

32:37.250 --> 32:39.013
we could easily jeopardize
our murder investigation.

32:39.050 --> 32:41.052
If we can get to someone
on the inside,

32:41.090 --> 32:43.183
we can go after Dean and
his crew for extortion

32:43.220 --> 32:45.085
and racketeering-- squeeze 'em
on the Standley murder.

32:45.130 --> 32:48.293
I think I know someone at
the casino who can help us.

32:51.130 --> 32:52.722
Molly.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.032
Hey, Charlie.

32:54.070 --> 32:55.662
Funny running into you.

32:55.700 --> 32:58.134
We need to talk.
In private.

32:58.170 --> 33:00.661
Look, Charlie,
I know that you're upset

33:00.710 --> 33:02.473
about Mr. Zager
not extending you a marker,

33:02.510 --> 33:05.149
but this is
really inappropriate.

33:07.210 --> 33:09.678
I can't believe I let
cops into the club.

33:09.720 --> 33:13.110
Do you know what will happen
to me if

33:13.150 --> 33:15.118
I'm interested in things

33:15.160 --> 33:19.119
far more serious
than a card game, okay?

33:19.160 --> 33:21.196
How long you been working
with Dean and the others?

33:21.230 --> 33:23.221
A few years.

33:23.260 --> 33:25.467
I-I started playing cards
in business school

33:25.500 --> 33:28.162
af-after some personal stuff.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.189
I was good.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.537
I won.

33:30.570 --> 33:31.605
For a while, anyway.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.267
That why you dropped
out of school?

33:33.310 --> 33:35.107
I was tapped out.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.279
But Dean offered me
a deal and I took it.

33:37.310 --> 33:39.107
They waived my debt in exchange

33:39.150 --> 33:40.674
for running the floor for them.

33:40.710 --> 33:43.679
I tried leaving
a few months back.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.779
They wouldn't let me go.

33:45.820 --> 33:47.048
Who's "they"?

33:47.090 --> 33:49.718
Dean, Zager, anybody else?

33:49.760 --> 33:51.785
Maybe a silent partner?

33:51.830 --> 33:54.196
Germ.

33:54.230 --> 33:55.424
One of the poker players.

33:55.460 --> 33:58.395
Zager come up with the plan?

33:58.430 --> 34:00.762
There's no Zager.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.234
Dean and Germ invented him

34:03.270 --> 34:06.137
as a cover-- well,
really it-it was Germ.

34:06.170 --> 34:09.173
He's terriﬁed of
going to jail again.

34:09.210 --> 34:11.747
So he invented
a phantom boss.

34:11.780 --> 34:16.240
My God, I am dead if they
find out that I ratted...

34:16.280 --> 34:17.611
Listen to me.

34:17.650 --> 34:19.743
We can protect you.
We can work with the DA.

34:19.790 --> 34:21.189
We can get it in writing.

34:21.220 --> 34:23.279
If you help us
take down your bosses,

34:23.320 --> 34:25.584
I can make sure that you walk.

34:25.630 --> 34:26.756
You don't get it.

34:26.790 --> 34:29.224
These guys are wired.

34:29.260 --> 34:31.626
We've never been raided.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.626
And I'm pretty sure it's
because they've got

34:33.670 --> 34:36.298
vice cops on their payroll.

34:37.670 --> 34:39.228
You recognize him?

34:39.270 --> 34:41.670
Yeah, sure. That's Marty.

34:41.710 --> 34:44.349
Have Dean and Germ _been
extending him credit?

34:44.380 --> 34:46.405
He owes them big.

34:46.450 --> 34:48.771
I'm looking
for other people like Marty

34:48.820 --> 34:51.311
who are in the hole
to your bosses.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.318
You keep records of that?

34:53.350 --> 34:54.851
I have a ledger.

34:54.890 --> 34:58.326
But, I mean, Dean has control
over it when I leave.

34:58.360 --> 35:01.329
There's some file in
the back he has locked up.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.351
If you want your life back,

35:03.400 --> 35:06.096
I'm gonna need your help.

35:07.270 --> 35:09.898
I want my life back.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.760
Okay, so the ledger
will give us the names

35:11.810 --> 35:12.959
of the other_exto_rtion
and racketeering Victims,

35:13.010 --> 35:15.672
and then we use our leverage
to find out who killed Standley.

35:15.710 --> 35:17.200
But how are you gonna get
that ledger out of there?

35:17.240 --> 35:18.878
The plan is Carrie
and I show up

35:18.910 --> 35:20.400
like we did last night,
but Molly greets us

35:20.450 --> 35:22.418
before security pats us down.

35:22.450 --> 35:24.680
We escort her out
with the ledger,

35:24.720 --> 35:26.608
then we signal ESU
to move on the casino.

35:26.650 --> 35:28.288
That's a lot
of working parts, Burns.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.514
It's the only way
to bring them down.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.187
Molly's just getting
to work right now.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.788
I don't_want to leave her
hanging for too long.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.923
She's in a dangerous corner.
We gotta move.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.154
Hey.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.121
Remember that burner cell

35:37.160 --> 35:38.866
that Standley called
the night he was killed?

35:38.900 --> 35:40.561
I just tracked
a call from it

35:40.600 --> 35:42.261
to the switchboard
at Police Plaza.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.404
The call could be to vice.
Germ and Dean might

35:44.440 --> 35:45.737
already know we've been inside.

35:45.770 --> 35:46.668
You gotta move now.

35:46.710 --> 35:48.234
All right.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.599
All right.

35:57.250 --> 35:59.480
(pop music playing,
low and indistinct)

36:07.690 --> 36:10.295
No bouncer.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.842
Something feels off.

36:25.880 --> 36:29.338
Something tells me your
gut's right this time.

36:42.860 --> 36:45.590
What the hell is going on?

36:58.010 --> 36:59.739
They knew we were coming.

36:59.780 --> 37:02.419
Maybe they were tipped by Vice.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.484
MOLLY :
Aah! Help!

37:06.520 --> 37:09.489
Help! They're in there!
No, no!

37:09.520 --> 37:11.750
This way, this way! Get down!
Get down! Get down behind me!

37:21.070 --> 37:23.493
Germ shot Dean. They were
fighting over the money.

37:23.540 --> 37:25.701
I was next!

37:31.550 --> 37:33.768
He's going for the back exit!
Get out of here! Go! Go!

37:33.810 --> 37:35.675
Go!
Okay!

37:39.420 --> 37:41.388
Our victim is
Scott Sta ndley,

37:41.420 --> 37:42.751
Zoning Board Commissioner.

37:42.790 --> 37:43.916
No sign
of forced entry.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.794
I need a marker.
Like the one

37:56.840 --> 37:58.364
you gave that guy over there.

38:00.370 --> 38:02.634
DEAN:
Only Mr. Zager approves markers.

38:07.110 --> 38:10.511
DEAN: We can't float you
anything at this time.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.520
Okay, listen, it's Molly.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.959
She's running the whole thing.

38:20.990 --> 38:22.423
Go get her. I got this.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.759
You got this

38:25.800 --> 38:27.324
All right, fine.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.508
AL: You're not getting
out of here, Germ.

38:32.540 --> 38:35.771
I'm not going back
to prison either.

38:44.550 --> 38:45.539
Okay. Go.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.581
Okay.

38:47.620 --> 38:49.019
Let's go!

38:49.060 --> 38:52.689
Everybody out!
Out! Let's go!

38:52.730 --> 38:53.822
Quickly! Move!

38:55.460 --> 38:56.757
All right, we're clear.
Move in!

39:13.180 --> 39:16.115
No, no, no, no, no.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.751
This way.

39:27.790 --> 39:29.724
Step inside

39:29.760 --> 39:31.489
and state your name.

39:31.530 --> 39:33.669
Gotcha.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.007
Drop it!

39:43.040 --> 39:44.746
Hands
on the wheel.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.600
Nice bluff, Molly.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.901
You almost had us.

39:47.950 --> 39:49.542
But we own your ass now.

39:51.590 --> 39:52.943
You got here fast.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.685
Yeah, I move all right.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.755
Just talked with Ballistics.
The gun in Molly's purse

39:58.790 --> 40:00.849
matches to Standley's murder.
She killed him

40:00.890 --> 40:02.198
'cause she couldn't
blackmail him.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.198
And Germ's been spilling
to Murray.

40:04.230 --> 40:07.028
Turns out he lost his ass
to Molly three years ago.

40:07.070 --> 40:09.664
Rather than offing him
like she did Standley,

40:09.700 --> 40:10.860
she concocted this scheme

40:10.900 --> 40:13.505
to have him and Dean
front as the boss.

40:13.540 --> 40:14.939
And the call she made
to Police Plaza

40:14.980 --> 40:17.608
was just to divert suspicion
from herself.

40:17.640 --> 40:19.642
She-she was a smart,
shrewd lady.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.444
She was seconds away
from disappearing forever.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.708
ELIOT:
Well-played, team.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.183
Really.
Well-played.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.984
Now there's just the, uh, matter
of my money.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.009
What money?

40:32.630 --> 40:35.599
Does it ever get old, Wells?

40:35.630 --> 40:37.928
No.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.564
Fine.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.694
Here's your money. All of it
is there. Every penny.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.004
You don't have to count it.
You can trust me.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.065
Mmm.

40:47.110 --> 40:49.999
L... Oh.
All those hours gambling

40:50.040 --> 40:52.838
and yet you return the exact

40:52.880 --> 40:53.778
amount I gave you.

40:53.810 --> 40:55.118
Now...

40:55.150 --> 40:56.674
what are the odds of that?

40:56.720 --> 40:57.675
Uh, you said,

40:57.720 --> 40:59.540
"I want all of it

40:59.590 --> 41:00.739
returned.
Every penny."

41:00.790 --> 41:02.815
And I kept my end
of the bargain.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.088
You should be happy.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.656
Fine.

41:05.690 --> 41:07.783
I will take my little win
and I will fold.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.526
Carrie,

41:13.570 --> 41:16.596
you have to know,
I can only protect you so far

41:16.640 --> 41:18.096
with this stuff.

41:18.140 --> 41:20.859
I know. Thank you.

41:20.910 --> 41:23.834
But there will come a time.

41:30.250 --> 41:33.583
Should I even ask what you're
gonna do with the money you won?

41:33.620 --> 41:34.655
You can't keep it.
All right.

41:34.690 --> 41:36.555
How 'bout a little wager?

41:36.590 --> 41:38.182
_Arm wrestle.
You Win, the money goes

41:38.220 --> 41:41.599
to charity;
I win, hello, Puerto Rico.

41:41.630 --> 41:44.599
This is you not gambling?
You can't help yourself.

41:44.630 --> 41:45.597
One last bet. Come on.

41:45.630 --> 41:46.858
Let's go.
You're just scared.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.868
Yeah? All right.
I'm very,
very strong.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.562
I don't just have
a super memory...

41:51.610 --> 41:53.908
You... are going down.

41:53.940 --> 41:55.976
I'll send you a postcard
from the beach.

41:56.010 --> 41:57.079
Count of three?

41:57.110 --> 41:58.077
Yep.

41:58.110 --> 42:00.943
One... two... three.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.117
This is quite strange.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.286
Are we gonna, um...

42:10.320 --> 42:13.756
wrestle or-o_r hold hands
all night?

42:13.790 --> 42:15.792
Call it a draw?

42:16.830 --> 42:17.694
You win.

42:17.730 --> 42:18.958
Money goes to charity.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.059
Oh, the game was fixed.

42:21.100 --> 42:24.331
I just wanted you to see
how good it feels to win.

42:24.370 --> 42:26.838
Can the winner
buy you a drink?

42:26.870 --> 42:28.679
Always.

42:28.710 --> 42:30.701
Let's go, Charlie.
