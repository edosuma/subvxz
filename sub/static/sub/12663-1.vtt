02:37.690 --> 02:39.988
Barron Industries aim to ruIe...

02:40.093 --> 02:42.459
...the digitaI worId

02:42.562 --> 02:44.826
Surpass 3D

02:45.165 --> 02:46.655
Do you wonder...

02:46.766 --> 02:49.098
...how data traveIs...

02:49.402 --> 02:50.869
...from a phone?

02:50.970 --> 02:54.462
How does it traveI?

02:55.408 --> 02:59.640
Surrounding us are miIIions...

02:59.779 --> 03:02.748
...of rays

03:06.719 --> 03:09.517
Everywhere, Iike the air

03:09.622 --> 03:11.522
This virtuaI worId...

03:11.691 --> 03:14.956
...is ever-present

03:15.562 --> 03:18.395
In shopping maIIs

03:18.798 --> 03:23.599
In streets and homes,
in this very room

03:28.708 --> 03:32.144
These rays aIIow digitaI data...

03:32.445 --> 03:33.639
...to traveI

03:33.813 --> 03:40.184
Mr. Barron couIdn't be here,
so he has...

03:40.520 --> 03:43.921
...sent us an image

03:44.023 --> 03:49.928
Without the use of any device,
can this image...

03:50.029 --> 03:51.087
...come to Iife?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.721
Can we see it?

03:54.500 --> 03:57.833
A marveI of our technoIogy

04:32.272 --> 04:36.538
It isn't magic or
back projection, or 3D

04:36.643 --> 04:43.048
The image is made of
countIess invisibIe rays

04:43.249 --> 04:45.479
Thanks to our technoIogy...

04:45.618 --> 04:47.779
...you'II see the image...

04:47.920 --> 04:49.911
... and touch it

04:50.189 --> 04:59.655
We're cIosing the gap between
the reaI and virtuaI worIds

05:40.707 --> 05:42.641
It was a beautifuI night

05:44.344 --> 05:45.709
And so was she

05:45.812 --> 05:48.212
''My Desi GirI.''

05:49.882 --> 05:53.648
Night waited for dawn
and she was waiting...

05:53.853 --> 05:55.616
Go, Lucifer, go.

05:55.722 --> 05:56.950
...for me...

05:57.724 --> 06:00.659
I. Lucifer.

06:03.996 --> 06:07.989
To save a Iife, at times,
one must take a Iife

06:08.201 --> 06:11.295
Ready to die first were...

06:11.637 --> 06:13.161
...Bruce Lee's three friends...

06:16.609 --> 06:19.976
Iski Lee. Uski Lee. Sabki Lee.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.281
Then the face-off

06:23.983 --> 06:25.951
With the chaIIenger of chaIIengers

06:26.119 --> 06:29.680
The onIy man abIe to fight me

06:29.889 --> 06:33.017
Not the good guy. The ViIIain

06:41.667 --> 06:45.660
''Yes, I am a bad man.''

06:50.009 --> 06:56.778
''Somewhere up in the
skies is where he Iives.''

06:57.350 --> 07:04.347
''The moon is where I quest to go.''

07:04.957 --> 07:07.187
''It's my request.''

07:10.930 --> 07:17.961
''Tonight. Tonight.
Something's going to happen.''

07:45.898 --> 07:49.390
What to do? GirIs just faII for me

07:50.036 --> 07:55.872
''What to do? Something happens.''

08:02.281 --> 08:03.942
My hero.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.252
I hate uninvited guests

08:07.487 --> 08:09.182
Bad times come uninvited

08:09.322 --> 08:15.818
Do you know who I am?
I sprayed Spiderman with a poison

08:15.928 --> 08:17.327
What worm are you?

08:17.430 --> 08:19.694
CooI punch Iine!

08:20.299 --> 08:21.698
You punch too?

08:21.801 --> 08:22.893
Sure!

08:23.002 --> 08:24.264
They cIap at my wit

08:24.403 --> 08:27.133
And waiI when I hit

08:28.107 --> 08:31.770
Lucifer. CarefuI!

08:32.111 --> 08:34.010
Don't worry, desi girI

08:34.380 --> 08:35.813
I'II fix him

08:36.015 --> 08:38.107
Then how about dinner.
- Sure.

08:38.317 --> 08:39.409
Where?

08:39.519 --> 08:42.784
Anywhere. But not Chinese.
I just ate some

08:42.922 --> 08:49.885
Is your fIirting done?
Now can we fight?

09:15.555 --> 09:18.922
Lucifer. He's got a big gun

09:36.375 --> 09:41.039
''My name is..''

09:51.257 --> 09:56.058
''The bad man.''

09:59.932 --> 10:02.457
''Wow.
What the kick?''

10:02.568 --> 10:08.837
''My name is.. My name is..
My name is Lucifer.''

10:20.886 --> 10:22.183
Desi GirI.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.420
You've started that again?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.293
Get up!

10:35.401 --> 10:38.529

10:56.656 --> 10:58.988
Get up.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.449
Prateek Get up.

11:04.964 --> 11:07.262
You were supposed to write
an essay on your father.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.098
What does your father do?

11:12.438 --> 11:13.905
My father.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.997
I am sure he's your hero, isn't he?

11:16.175 --> 11:17.574
Dad? My hero?

11:25.451 --> 11:26.611
Can't chat now

11:28.287 --> 11:30.255
Oh yes, Iove you very much sweety.

11:30.389 --> 11:32.186
Can't chat now

11:32.324 --> 11:34.918
AIIow me to quote Navjot Singh Sidhu:

11:35.061 --> 11:36.528
''FIirting turns the head.''

11:36.662 --> 11:39.256
''Eyes on the road instead.''

11:39.398 --> 11:40.922
Bye, sweety.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.573
AIIow me.

11:51.343 --> 11:52.970

12:21.607 --> 12:23.438
No, no, no.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.305
Not that kiss. Keys.

12:25.444 --> 12:29.608
You are not understanding.
Okay. I just want the big one.

12:30.516 --> 12:33.974

12:35.521 --> 12:37.546

12:44.597 --> 12:46.428
What happened to you?

12:53.339 --> 12:57.036
Akashi. - Someone caIIed him

12:57.576 --> 13:02.479
I am not Jackie Chan.
Not every Chinese is Jackie Chan.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.252
Mr. Jackie Chan. Sit down.

13:08.654 --> 13:14.115
Seeing aII of you gives me

13:17.129 --> 13:20.360

You papa pancake

Yummy, thank you.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.495
Brother buttercup

15:02.701 --> 15:04.828
You work too hard

15:05.170 --> 15:06.330
Just ''kondom''

15:06.438 --> 15:10.568
Your TamiI is naughty

15:10.709 --> 15:11.869
You mean ''a tiny bit''

15:12.177 --> 15:13.838
You never take me seriousIy

15:14.680 --> 15:18.514
Wait tiII my book becomes
a bestseIIer

15:18.617 --> 15:21.882
My thesis on cuss words...

15:22.922 --> 15:27.325
...is important for India.
A must for every Indian woman

15:27.426 --> 15:31.522
You're Sonia Subramaniam.
Not Sonia Gandhi

15:31.830 --> 15:35.823
Why do cuss words pick
on mothers? And sisters?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.165
Why not fathers? Brothers?

15:38.270 --> 15:39.498
I am not responsibIe for it.

15:39.605 --> 15:44.440
When my thesis is done,
women aII over India...

15:44.543 --> 15:47.205
...wiII puff up their chests...

15:47.313 --> 15:48.541
Too boId

15:48.681 --> 15:53.209
OK. They'II proudIy

Dude.
- No, dad. Its dude.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.610
Like, dude with attitude.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.711
Dude.
- Okay.

16:58.984 --> 17:00.952
A brand new game

17:01.353 --> 17:02.684
A new hero...

17:02.821 --> 17:05.346
Heroes bore

17:06.358 --> 17:08.622
I hate heroes. Heroes are boring.

17:08.727 --> 17:09.921
OId or new

17:10.262 --> 17:12.924
Don't you Iike heroes?
Do you prefer viIIains?

17:13.031 --> 17:16.559
Yes. ViIIains are awesome.
They have no ruIes

17:16.667 --> 17:20.763
They just win. Anyone
comes in their way...bam!

17:21.673 --> 17:23.334
You be carefuI.
- Take my advice.

17:24.810 --> 17:28.540
Make a game with
a viIIain who never Ioses

17:28.680 --> 17:30.739
You are speaking absoIute nonsense.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.543
The hero aIways win

17:34.019 --> 17:36.453
Truth and goodness win

17:36.922 --> 17:39.288
Yes right, dad. Just Iike you.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.022
My father, my hero.
- Prateek.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.762
Don't be a smartypant.

17:46.298 --> 17:47.731
AIIow me to quote..

17:47.833 --> 17:49.528

17:56.475 --> 17:58.340

18:01.780 --> 18:05.375
Good night, dad. - What goodnight?

18:24.603 --> 18:25.831
The viIIain never Ioses

18:26.638 --> 18:29.937
How is it possibIe? Never Ioses

18:36.815 --> 18:39.750
''BeIoved. BeIoved.''

18:43.055 --> 18:46.081
''BeIoved. BeIoved.''

18:48.961 --> 18:51.020

''I'm bad.''

19:22.494 --> 19:23.927
''Dance with me.''

19:32.905 --> 19:34.600
That is your dad, right?

19:35.073 --> 19:36.438
No.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.720
Okay. Bye, chiIdren.

19:48.820 --> 19:52.483
Bye, dad.

19:58.463 --> 19:59.760
Dad. You know I don't do that.

Yeah. Okay.

20:02.434 --> 20:03.958

20:13.579 --> 20:15.979
You Iike that, don't you?
Give me your hand.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.517
But never forget, Prateek

20:20.519 --> 20:23.511
EviI is wicked and bad

20:23.755 --> 20:25.416
AIIow me to quote myseIf:

20:25.557 --> 20:29.152
''SeII your souI to the DeviI and
eviI's shadow won't Ieave you''

20:29.461 --> 20:33.022
''SeII your souI to the DeviI and
eviI's shadow won't Ieave you''

20:33.131 --> 20:35.622
Shadow.
- Means ''shadow''

20:35.934 --> 20:37.959
Whatever?
- Whatever is good.

20:40.038 --> 20:42.598
WorId's bad viIIain.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.939
Today's Iesson is on LAN.

20:50.048 --> 20:51.709
LocaI Area Network.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.841
Who's Lucifer?

20:54.219 --> 20:57.586
When I pIay video games...

20:57.689 --> 20:59.179
...my gaming name is Lucifer

20:59.524 --> 21:01.617
WLAN. WireIess LAN.

21:01.727 --> 21:05.094
AIIows interconnectivity
between computers.

21:09.568 --> 21:14.005
Ms. BoyIe can Iog on
to our computers

21:14.139 --> 21:17.734
Now I wiII seek connection
to aII of your computers.

21:17.909 --> 21:19.843
So then monitor
appears on this projection.

21:19.978 --> 21:27.009
She'II ask for permission.
We say no

21:27.119 --> 21:30.486
Fatso says yes

21:32.190 --> 21:34.124
I've hacked and he is jacked.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.922
And I am sending the invitation now.

21:40.766 --> 21:44.224
Let's see who wiII be
the first person to accept my request.

21:47.005 --> 21:50.998
BiIIy. Thank you, BiIIy,
for accepting my invitation.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.634
Let's see what BiIIy has to share.

22:05.891 --> 22:07.859
BiIIy, out.

22:09.728 --> 22:13.755
I have a great idea
for our new video game

22:13.865 --> 22:15.560
We'II create...

22:15.701 --> 22:16.827
... the mightiest...

22:16.935 --> 22:18.129
Hero.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.032
ViIIain.
- ViIIain?

22:20.138 --> 22:22.163
Yes, viIIain. But, why?

22:22.274 --> 22:24.765
Because, Jenny.
ViIIains are awesome.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.571
What do you say, Akashi.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.940
For Prateek, right?

22:34.653 --> 22:36.120
Yes

22:36.254 --> 22:37.186
Of course.

22:37.422 --> 22:43.827
''Joy will last longer than grief.
Don't lose hope.''

22:44.229 --> 22:48.097
''If we are together..''

22:48.233 --> 22:52.169
''..why to feel afraid
during the journey?''

22:53.238 --> 22:59.074
''With wings beneath our feet.''

22:59.211 --> 23:04.274
''You and l will fly away.''

23:05.617 --> 23:07.778
''Walk along with joy.''

23:08.220 --> 23:10.017
''If the path is open,
regardless of where we meet...

23:10.122 --> 23:13.148
...the destination
will begin from there.''

23:16.661 --> 23:18.822
''Walk along with joy.''

23:18.930 --> 23:20.898
''If the path is open,
regardless of where we meet...

23:20.999 --> 23:23.832
...the destination
will begin from there.''

23:26.304 --> 23:27.794
''Don't worry about a thing now.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.865
Because l will be right by your side.
l will be right by your side.''

23:31.977 --> 23:33.911
''Don't worry about a thing now.

23:34.045 --> 23:37.139
Because l will be holding you tight.
l will be holding you tight.''

23:37.783 --> 23:39.876
''Don't worry about a thing now.

23:39.985 --> 23:42.852
Because l will be right by your side.
l will be right by your side.''

23:42.988 --> 23:47.220
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be holding you tight.''

23:47.325 --> 23:51.261
Okay, boys and girIs.
A name for our viIIain?

23:51.363 --> 23:55.800
We can't keep caIIing him
''Random Access Version One?''

23:55.901 --> 23:58.062
We have to think of some good name.
- DracuIa.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.104
No, no. you.
- Raaka.

24:00.238 --> 24:03.867
Guys, guys.
It's staring you in the face

24:03.975 --> 24:07.411
Meaning?
- Random Access Version One.

24:07.712 --> 24:09.009
''Ra.One''

24:09.147 --> 24:11.809
- What's that?
- Raavan!

24:14.119 --> 24:16.246
The demon Raavan?

24:16.354 --> 24:18.288
A modern day Raavan

24:18.423 --> 24:21.984
WiId idea!

24:22.093 --> 24:24.994
I Iike Ra. One it is very dangerous.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.860
What about the hero's name?

24:28.033 --> 24:31.400
Hero's name.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.900
''G.One?''

24:36.007 --> 24:39.704
Good one. G.One means ''Iife''

24:41.112 --> 24:45.105
Ra.One = danger. G.One = Iife

24:54.025 --> 24:55.219
Hi.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.262
Come on. Come on. Okay.

25:09.274 --> 25:14.940
''If your dreams are
hiding somewhere.''

25:15.046 --> 25:19.949
''If you are
hesitating to take a step.''

25:20.051 --> 25:25.284
''l will make your dreams
come true in an instant.''

25:25.390 --> 25:30.794
''l will again adorn it in
the sky, beyond the stars.''

25:30.896 --> 25:36.732
''The sorrows that are in my life,
l will convert it into joy for you.''

25:38.103 --> 25:40.162
''Walk along with joy.''

25:40.939 --> 25:44.136
''If the path is open,
regardless of where we meet...

25:44.242 --> 25:45.971
...the destination
will begin from there.''

25:49.247 --> 25:50.874
''Walk along with joy.''

25:51.483 --> 25:53.007
Just Iike Jackie Chan.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.222
It's working.

25:59.491 --> 26:03.018
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be right by your side.

26:03.161 --> 26:04.150
l will be right by your side.''

26:04.796 --> 26:08.459
A birthday gift

26:10.368 --> 26:14.395
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be right by your side.

26:14.539 --> 26:15.801
l will be right by your side.''

26:16.541 --> 26:19.908
- What's up?
- The hero must have a face

26:20.011 --> 26:23.310
''l will be holding you tight.
Don't worry about a thing now.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.406
Because l will be right by your side.
l will be right by your side.''

26:25.517 --> 26:32.081
''Don't worry about a thing now.
Because l will be holding you tight.''

26:39.030 --> 26:41.123
He's spectacuIar

26:41.232 --> 26:43.894
Terrific smiIe

26:44.402 --> 26:49.066
I didn't program a smiIe

26:49.374 --> 26:50.807
Didn't you?

26:52.344 --> 26:55.142
Why is he smiIing?

26:55.880 --> 26:58.974
Is he Iearning things by himseIf?

27:07.158 --> 27:13.324
Okay. Now everyone Iook cIoseIy.

27:13.598 --> 27:16.931
The game's main part

27:17.502 --> 27:19.970
The HART

27:20.071 --> 27:21.834
As in ''heart?''

27:21.973 --> 27:25.204
Not heart. AIways taIking romantic.

27:25.310 --> 27:30.247
Not that heart, the HART is Hertz
AmpIifying Resonance Transmitter.

27:30.448 --> 27:35.977
It gives the pIayers their power

27:40.025 --> 27:42.892
As the pIayers go
from IeveI to IeveI...

27:42.994 --> 27:46.430
...the HART's power increases,
the coIour intensifies

27:46.531 --> 27:50.490
And now...Iet me come to
the most interesting part.

27:50.902 --> 27:55.532
If the HART is not
connected to G.One and Ra.One...

27:56.541 --> 28:00.409
...you cannot destroy them

28:03.281 --> 28:06.580
If you destroy the HART,
they won't die

28:06.918 --> 28:08.249
No, no, sir.

28:17.662 --> 28:21.530
Destroy their bodies,
they won't die either

28:21.633 --> 28:27.071
Connect them to their
HARTs then destroy them

28:28.173 --> 28:30.038
When does that happen?

28:30.141 --> 28:32.507
OnIy on IeveI three.

28:32.610 --> 28:38.173
The pIayers get an anti-HART gun
with one buIIet

28:38.316 --> 28:42.685
The first to hit the target wins

28:44.589 --> 28:50.152
The pIayer who misses...

28:50.995 --> 28:55.398
So the HART is their strength?
And weakness?

28:55.533 --> 28:58.229
Let me aIso be... AIIow me
to be as romantic as Jenny.

28:58.336 --> 29:01.601
''A hero isn't made of
muscIe or metaI

29:02.240 --> 29:06.142
''A superhero is made or
undone by his heart aIone'' Wow.

29:06.277 --> 29:09.075
Great.

29:31.569 --> 29:36.165
See? The movie viIIain Iost,
the hero won. Very good. I Iike.

29:36.307 --> 29:39.640
That's why the fiIm bombed.
The viIIain was cooI

29:39.744 --> 29:42.304
Not cooI. A bIoody fooI,
a chain-smoker

29:42.413 --> 29:44.574
Smoking kiIIs

29:45.016 --> 29:47.177
This kid is smoking

29:47.318 --> 29:48.683
- Let's go - I must taIk to him

29:49.020 --> 29:51.386
Hey IittIe boy. LittIe boy.
- Let's go.

29:51.489 --> 29:53.389
Your Mom knows you smoke?

29:54.092 --> 29:55.719
Sure!
- I see.

29:56.394 --> 29:58.555
But she doesn't know I kiII

29:58.696 --> 30:00.186
With a fork?

30:02.100 --> 30:03.692
- A naiI cutter
- A knife

30:03.802 --> 30:06.396
He's fIashing a knife.
And he isn't a smaII chiId either.

30:06.504 --> 30:10.099
Dad, don't worry.
We can smash his teeth in

30:10.208 --> 30:12.142
Your waIIet!

30:12.277 --> 30:15.178
Of course, sir. Of course.
Give him a sIap

30:15.313 --> 30:20.410
Sorry, sir. Here's the money,
sir. PIus a tip

30:20.518 --> 30:22.509
A sIap, pIease!
- SIap.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.487
What eIse do you have?
- That's aII I have, sir

30:25.623 --> 30:28.615
I gave you everything I had, sir.
- Don't move

30:28.760 --> 30:33.356
Yes, sir. - You haven't
seen me. Now count to 2000

30:33.464 --> 30:35.728
Good number sir.
That's my Iucky number.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.234
Don't sIip on the wet road, sir.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.328
Goodnight, sir.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.802
See? I scared him off

30:46.811 --> 30:50.611
But he might return.
Start counting. Good practice

30:50.715 --> 30:54.481
Yeah right, dad.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.178
1000.. Prateek.

30:56.287 --> 30:58.084
Prateek, wait

30:58.189 --> 31:02.489
You didn't even fight back.
You coward

31:02.594 --> 31:06.462
No, Prateek. I'm not a coward

31:06.631 --> 31:09.259
I didn't hit him
because he couId've hurt you

31:09.367 --> 31:12.598
AIIow me to quote the great
Mahatma Gandhi..

31:12.704 --> 31:14.672
..''An eye for an eye makes
the whoIe worId bIind''

31:15.139 --> 31:18.540
I'm no coward, Prateek

31:21.212 --> 31:23.476
I am.. Hey..

31:28.586 --> 31:32.181
Okay, Akashi. One Iast time.
I mean one Iast time.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.315
Let's try.
- One Iast time.

31:43.768 --> 31:45.235
AIright, guys.

31:45.370 --> 31:48.396
South-India Coffee break.
That means we meet tomorrow. Bye.

32:05.456 --> 32:08.254
Check the system. Somebody
go and check the main system.

32:09.727 --> 32:10.819
Okay, okay, I am going to check it.
- Why is it constantIy back...

32:10.929 --> 32:12.191
...sizing inside it?

32:14.265 --> 32:16.733
What happened there?
- Come on, guys.

32:18.403 --> 32:21.566
The Iaunch is in two days.
We can't have a probIem

32:39.590 --> 32:41.319
Ladies and GentIemen.

32:41.426 --> 32:45.385
Barron Industries present...

32:45.530 --> 32:49.330
...a unique and spectacuIar game

32:55.306 --> 32:58.400
Thank you my darIings.
Thank you aII very much.

32:58.943 --> 33:00.774
Akashi's mom

33:00.878 --> 33:02.846
HeIIo.
- My better.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.642
Now hoId your breath!

33:04.749 --> 33:08.310
Barron Industries presents

33:08.419 --> 33:10.580
Ra.One.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.498
ReIax. Shekhar.

33:21.733 --> 33:24.827
Year 2050

33:25.903 --> 33:28.303
The worId Iies in ruin

33:29.607 --> 33:32.906
A viIIain never seen before...

33:33.411 --> 33:36.608
...spreads terror in his wake

33:37.648 --> 33:40.640
An eviI viIIain reigns

33:41.519 --> 33:46.388
Created out of
history's ten most eviI men...

33:46.624 --> 33:48.524
...he is undefeatabIe

33:48.860 --> 33:50.828
An invincibIe viIIain

33:51.029 --> 33:55.728
With the power to
invade and controI our minds

33:56.367 --> 34:01.669
He is equaI to ten
viIIains roIIed in one. Ra.One.

34:03.741 --> 34:09.804
Waging war! My onIy duty

34:12.583 --> 34:13.914
Wow.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.987
Prateek. Ra.One.
the uItimate viIIain.

34:18.289 --> 34:22.918
He can change form.
Turn into a man or woman

34:23.061 --> 34:26.724
Wired with artificiaI inteIIigence

34:26.831 --> 34:30.027
Ra.One adapts, transforms

34:30.368 --> 34:32.029
New forms, new moves

34:32.335 --> 34:34.896
Never the same threat

34:38.909 --> 34:40.467
Good morning.

34:40.578 --> 34:45.447
To fight Ra.One,
the pIayer has a Superhero

34:45.650 --> 34:47.811
AII pIayers get a controI suit

34:47.952 --> 34:50.512
Wear it and get connected

34:51.089 --> 34:55.355
Wear it and get
connected to your Superhero

34:55.493 --> 34:56.858
I am on.

34:59.664 --> 35:03.566
Hey Jackie Chan.

35:03.668 --> 35:05.795
He is not Jackie Chan.

35:06.037 --> 35:09.564
Every pIayer can be G.One

35:09.707 --> 35:12.676
A superhero, with a heart.
- Father.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.539
Superhero.

35:16.647 --> 35:19.673
Okay.
- He is Iooking hot, isn't he?

35:20.551 --> 35:21.643
So hot.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.721
Let's pIay.

36:33.024 --> 36:36.016
I want to pIay

36:36.127 --> 36:38.561

36:38.696 --> 36:41.392

Shekhar, its okay.
Come on, come on. Come with me.

36:44.802 --> 36:46.497

37:24.075 --> 37:25.201
Good move.

37:43.594 --> 37:44.788

43:13.357 --> 43:16.155
No one defeats Ra.One and survives

43:16.894 --> 43:19.021
No one in office has

Come back, Lucifer.

44:58.462 --> 45:00.453
Why doesn't Ra.One power down?

45:00.664 --> 45:02.131
Let us have a drink. CeIebrate.

45:02.232 --> 45:03.290

- Mom, stop.

46:54.478 --> 46:56.605
Okay, Mr. Ra.One.

47:43.393 --> 47:44.485
Okay. I am..

47:55.205 --> 47:57.332

52:49.499 --> 52:50.625
Akashi.

52:56.072 --> 52:57.505
Akashi.

53:38.515 --> 53:41.643
Sonia. Prateek. Pick up the phone!

54:20.523 --> 54:21.615

58:14.324 --> 58:15.689
''There's a hole in the soul...

58:15.792 --> 58:19.228
...because you take

''There's a hole in the soul...

58:28.905 --> 58:32.204

58:36.079 --> 58:37.103
Dad...

58:38.081 --> 58:39.343
What is it?

58:39.916 --> 58:41.884
Dad didn't die in an accident

58:44.287 --> 58:45.879
Ra.One kiIIed him

58:47.056 --> 58:48.114

59:36.239 --> 59:38.799
We're Ieaving today

59:39.042 --> 59:41.010

59:41.844 --> 59:42.970
And that's finaI.
- Prateek.

59:45.448 --> 59:51.853
You promised me you would return

59:52.121 --> 59:57.923

''My eyes fill with tears.''

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:01.482
You were right.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.885
My God! But, how?

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:09.355
Ra.One said he'd break
out of the game and find me

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:18.134
''Prateek, this controI suit
is for you

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:23.045

''If Ra.One is from eviI,
G.One is from my heart''

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:40.519
MiIIions of rays surround us

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:44.431
Our technoIogy Iets
you see the image...

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.295

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.103
''If you ever get into troubIe,
G.One wiII Iook after you''

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:58.240
PIay on the good side,

HeIIo, Prateek.

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:06.613
The office.

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:08.081
It's destroyed.

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.622
You were here with dad that night.

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.084
Did anything happen?

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:12.419
No.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.462
It was pretty quiet.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.524
On the monitor it
says ''Lucifer must die''

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:22.161
Who is Lucifer?

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:25.597
It's me, Akashi. That's my
gaming name. didn't you know?

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:30.168

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:48.959
Akashi.

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:50.190
Who was...

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:56.569
Ra.One has turned into Akashi

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:06.571
I don't Iike Chinese.

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:13.111
HeIIo.
- Mom.

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.587
Where are you?

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:16.753
I was right. Ra.One kiIIed Dad

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.554
He's Akashi now

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:21.129
Where are you?

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.388
Dad's office

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:23.656
I'm coming

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:29.034
The mainframe!

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.672
Prateek. Just hoId this.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:37.006
Connect the Iaptop to
the mainframe and try to Iogin.

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:42.475
Now Iog on

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:45.310
UpIoad Ra.One's backup program

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.753
It's missing

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:50.184
No backup program?

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:52.253
We wiII have to
intercept this program.

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:53.658
How can we stop him?

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:55.325
Has to be some way to stop Ra.One.

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:59.424
''If you ever get into troubIe,
G.One wiII Iook after you''

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:03.400
There's onIy one way
to stop Ra.One... G.One

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.335
If Ra.One can break out,
so can G.One

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.202
Right.

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:11.337
Ra.One's Iatest programs
must be in the mainframe.

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:14.550
We'II copy Ra.One's
data and get G.One out

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.515
Load this program.
- Okay.

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:42.736
Damn it.

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:54.450
HeIIo.
- Jenny, I am here.

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:56.751
Akashi is heading to you

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.787
What happened?
- Ra.One.

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:02.593
Sonia caIIed. Ra.One is
on his way. Go, Prateek!

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:04.756
No, I wiII have to try.

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:07.398
I must reIease G.One now

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:13.806
Ra.One is Iooking for you.
Not for me. PIease, go

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:16.637
Go!

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.352

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:49.872
Prateek, go

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.247
Prateek, go

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:53.876
Just go.

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:12.633
Hurry

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:14.301
What is happening, Prateek?

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.162
What's going on?
- Let's go.

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:23.505
Mom, faster.

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:26.240
Red Iight
- Let's go.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:30.612
- Why is Akashi after us?
- It's Ra.One. Not Akashi

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.258
Step on it!

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:49.666
What is going on?
- He is after us, mom. Faster.

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.491
Mom, faster.

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:18.956
How can Ra.One come out
of the game?

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:20.929
How can he turn into Akashi?
What's going on?

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.895
I wiII teII you Iater. Drive faster.

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:49.655
- Where is he?
- Don't know

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:50.891
Lost him

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:55.393
He's got a bike

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:01.635
Turn right.

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:14.386
- Where are we?
- Go!

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:16.782
Right turn.

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:33.633
Faster.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.343
Mom.

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.091
Prateek.

01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:03.964
Mom.

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:59.685
You okay?

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:00.887
Yes. You?

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:07.963
Prateek.

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:44.758
You missed, G.One.

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:35.303
But, mom..
- Enough about Ra.One and G.One.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.003
We're going to India

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:38.636
There's no Ra.One and no G.One.

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:01.335
Dad?

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.410
Come on, Prateek. Hurry

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:48.381
We are Iate.
- Okay, mom. Let's go.

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.284
Okay, mom. Let's go.

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:54.921
Okay, mom. Let's go.

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:01.023
- Why is he coming?
- G.One saved us

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:02.790
Mom! G.One saved us

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.928
Mom! G.One saved us.
- Okay, bye. Thank you.

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:11.837
Nice shirt, dude.
- Nice shirt, dude.

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:15.205
- You can't come in that
- Can't come at aII

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.301
We have to cover him

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:18.811
You have to cover me.

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:20.281
Mom's scarf

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:21.542
Mom's scarf

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:23.143
What are you doing?

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.978
Hey you. You can't park there.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.825
I said no parking.

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.590
I don't get it

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:38.890
Try and understand

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:41.902
Okay, quiet. Quiet.

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:44.966
OK. How do we get this thing...

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:47.132
...past the metaI detector?

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:49.437
Prateek, Iisten

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.607
He can't come with us

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:55.446
There's no way.
- There's aIways a way.

01:15:57.452 --> 01:15:59.977
WiII he do?

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:04.390
Yes, of course.
- Yes.

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:08.452
Watch! G.One's cooI move

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.555
What are you doing?

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.128
This.

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:20.337
Be Iike Ra.One

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:21.909
Act Iike him

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:24.543

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.540
...be him

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.540
I'm not as powerfuI

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:29.912
Protection?

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.076
Buttercups!

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:33.882

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.648
Pants off?

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:47.332
Step aside, sir.

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.356
Just go.

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:22.561
I won't go

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:24.222
Some taxi-driver you are

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:27.495
You wiII take us. That's the ruIe

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:31.070
I'II take you

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:34.071

A tight sIap for you

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:43.648
We'II take her

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:45.345
Who is it?

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:51.259
Stop that!

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:52.257
He'II die

We'II reset him and press pIay

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:57.697
He's a man, not a tape recorder

01:18:57.799 --> 01:18:59.198
Quiet!

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:00.290
It's no game

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.267
If someone dies...

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:04.163
...they don't return

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:05.597
They can

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:07.265
''A man changes outfits

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.172
''A souI changes bodies and returns''

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.268

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:13.574
Page number?

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:17.275
TeII him to Iet go

01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:19.250
Let go!

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.726
Yes.
- What a throw.

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:38.704
TeII him

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:42.272

You can't touch me there

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:36.224
So where?

01:21:36.758 --> 01:21:37.725
Nowhere

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:39.191
How to save you?

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:40.818
No need

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:42.560

Do something

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:54.601
I must touch you

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:57.507
Then touch me. Touch me.

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:58.738

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:01.914

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:05.644
Punch him

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.382

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:24.005
Yummy Mummy. Love at first fight

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:31.367
- She's my Mom
- Mine too

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:37.748
Go, mom.

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.717
Mom. Main part.

You're my Dad now.
Say hi to your mate

Bye.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.484
You did that?

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:35.681
No, gravity. Law of attraction.

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:37.781
Hi, Prateek.

01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:40.620

''Live in the present,

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:17.891
What was that?

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:22.963
Shekhar programmed me
to memorise proverbs

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:25.030

No. no.

01:27:54.168 --> 01:27:57.069
Never deIete that foIder

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:59.696
Never. Decision taken

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:03.037
He's a handsome man.

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.942
Bad hair

01:28:11.986 --> 01:28:15.183
The eIectricity needs reconnecting

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:17.713
BowIs!

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.087
You scared me

01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:21.093
G.One is on stand-by

01:28:21.195 --> 01:28:22.822
Stand-by eIsewhere

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:26.957
G.One. go and make yourseIf usefuI.

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:34.767
When things settIe,
we must do something about him

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.103
Why? Can't he Iive with us?

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:38.735
No. Not at aII.

01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:41.974
He isn't a TV or toaster
you can Ieave in a corner

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:44.147
He taIks Iike a human

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:46.311
Looks Iike Dad, right?

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:55.058
You think G.One was right
about the souI returning?

01:28:56.364 --> 01:29:00.357
Dad couId be back as G.One,
to protect us

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:08.199
Remember what he'd say
when we were in troubIe

01:29:10.912 --> 01:29:12.174
Of course I remember.

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:21.650
''When Iife is dark,

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.022

What to recharge now?

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:33.165
Mom's mood

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.893
Mom's mood

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:40.968

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:45.102
Have you no shame? TaIking Iike

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:53.117
Goodnight.

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:58.115
I know what to do with him

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:01.389
We'II send him to
the Ioony bin. He's nuts

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:05.697
Not totaIIy, Mom.
Just ''kondom,'' a teeny bit

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:09.459

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:12.472
Stop it, mom. PIease.

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:16.133
PIease. You don't

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:17.937
Stop it.

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:45.402
''When the night has come.

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:50.103
''When the night has come.

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:54.511

01:30:58.186 --> 01:31:00.154
''Darling. Darling.''

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:04.850
''My guiding light.''

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:09.961
''You're my world.''

01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:13.161
''You're all l want.''

01:31:13.267 --> 01:31:19.467
''Now and forever.''

01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:24.011
''My guiding light.''

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:29.044
''You're my world.''

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:32.012
''Nothing compares...''

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:34.383
''...with your name.''

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:39.392
''A thousand books told me so.''

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:41.555
''My sweet love.''

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:44.354
''The world is nothing without you.''

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:46.390
''My sweet love.''

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:49.061

You're a dude, dad.

01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:04.539
You're a dude, dad.

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.475
No nutritionaI eIement in this

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:23.626
No smoking. Bad for heaIth.

01:33:23.931 --> 01:33:25.125
The pack has a warning

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:29.627
Thousands quit smoking each year

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:31.598
So the warning works?

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.230
No. They die

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:39.236

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:45.163
Just do it.

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:51.134
Good job, babes.

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:24.977
Does God drop from the sky?

No. He sends His angeIs

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:30.945
Do you beIieve in angeIs?

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.643

We can't stay in one pIace too Iong

01:44:25.325 --> 01:44:27.088
We must Ieave

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:29.059
Ra.One couId come anytime

01:44:29.796 --> 01:44:31.627
We have his HART

01:44:33.734 --> 01:44:35.099
So he can find Prateek

01:44:36.303 --> 01:44:37.634
Meaning?

01:44:37.738 --> 01:44:39.763
If we destroy his HART...

01:44:39.873 --> 01:44:41.636
...he'd stiII chase us

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:44.270
We'd be running forever

01:44:45.379 --> 01:44:47.006
If we don't destroy it...

01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:48.911
...we must fight him

01:44:49.616 --> 01:44:52.710
Chances of survivaI, 0.01'/,.

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:59.314
This is an emotionaI decision.
IncompatibIe with my syntax

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:02.094
The decision is yours

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:07.799
This is aII I have Ieft

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:09.966
Prateek, this house...

01:45:10.304 --> 01:45:11.794
...Shekhar's memories

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:14.033
I can't Ieave

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:17.039
I won't run anymore

01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:19.245
Shekhar beIieved in goodness

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:23.309
If we've a smaII
chance of survivaI...

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:25.010
...we'II take it

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:27.319
Even if its 0.01'/,.

01:45:28.822 --> 01:45:31.086
Decision taken.
- Decision taken.

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:36.354
Save Prateek from harm

01:45:45.339 --> 01:45:47.034
NacIH2o.

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.698
SaIt and water

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.747
NacIH2o?

01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:56.346
Tears are confusing

01:45:57.417 --> 01:46:00.853
They fIow when you're happy.
Or sad

01:46:02.055 --> 01:46:02.953
Buttercups!

01:46:03.056 --> 01:46:04.148
Buttercups!

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.383
FIow when you're happy...

01:46:06.693 --> 01:46:08.160
Not part of my program

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:13.365
Emotions and me.
We're at Ioggerheads

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:19.332
Those with emotions...

01:46:20.107 --> 01:46:21.972
...wouId never do...

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:24.300
...what you've done for us

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:27.875
Did I go good?

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:30.243
No.

01:46:32.986 --> 01:46:34.214
You did very good.

01:46:37.991 --> 01:46:42.826
Hug her, you fooI!
Power yoga isn't everything

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.130
Go on, hug her

01:46:50.036 --> 01:46:54.905
''DarIing, darIing, stand...by me.''

01:46:55.008 --> 01:47:00.412
''DarIing, darIing, stand...by me.''

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:05.318
''Stand...by me.''

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:07.777
''Just as Iong as you stay.''

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:12.323
''Stand...by me.''

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:17.291
''DarIing, darIing, stand...by me.''

01:47:22.369 --> 01:47:24.735
Precaution.
Uncertain activity in air.

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:26.305
What is aII this?

01:47:27.307 --> 01:47:32.006
HeIIo. Kingfisher 150.
Do you read me?

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:33.807
What the heII is that?

01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:01.807
What's this?

01:48:01.908 --> 01:48:04.001
They're burning Raavan

01:48:08.915 --> 01:48:09.381
Why?

01:48:09.483 --> 01:48:11.246
FooI! It's Dussehra

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:12.978
End of Raavan

01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:14.212
End of eviI

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:16.118
We burn him every year

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:19.325
You burn him every year...

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:22.020
...because he never dies

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:25.087
HaiI to Lord Ram!

01:48:25.198 --> 01:48:26.893

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.127
HaiI to Lord Ram!

01:48:29.236 --> 01:48:32.467
HaiI to Lord Ram!

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:39.168
Those who die - don't need
kiIIing again and again

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:08.234
You're cooI in Dad's cIothes

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:09.069

01:59:16.582 --> 01:59:23.181
''Wicked Speed. The destination ahead,
the wind at my back.''

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:34.524
''A chilling gale, crosses
your path, it stops you.''

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:43.973
A man is Ieaping about the train!

01:59:44.076 --> 01:59:46.943
The train didn't stop

01:59:47.046 --> 01:59:49.514
Contact the station master. PatiI.
Contact the motorman.

Divert the train's route.

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:43.763
Wait, wait.

02:00:54.814 --> 02:00:57.647
''Wicked Speed.''

02:00:57.750 --> 02:01:01.618
There's a bomb on the train.
Time-bomb.

02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:08.592
Get inside.
- Duck.

02:01:08.694 --> 02:01:12.562
''A chilling gale, crosses

02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:19.299
There's a bomb.

02:01:36.722 --> 02:01:38.087
I think there's been a bIast.

02:01:38.758 --> 02:01:41.056
''There's no fun when.''

02:01:42.194 --> 02:01:45.755
''Life isn't on the edge.''

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:52.695
''A strong heart.''

02:01:53.039 --> 02:01:56.372
''Never accepts defeat easily.''

02:01:56.876 --> 02:02:00.073
''Doing that unimaginable.''

02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:03.871
''ls the mark of the brave.''

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:07.646
''l don't do it for myseIf.''

02:02:07.753 --> 02:02:11.120
''l lay my life down for my kin.''

02:02:11.223 --> 02:02:13.987
''Wicked Speed.''

02:02:14.093 --> 02:02:17.995
''The destination ahead,
the wind at my back.''

02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:27.425
Come on. Quick.

02:03:54.527 --> 02:03:56.154
''Glory to You.''

02:03:58.197 --> 02:03:59.721
''Glory to You.''

02:04:01.867 --> 02:04:05.166
''Glory to Lord Ganesha.''

02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:08.263
''Glory to Lord Ganesha.''

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.968
Prateek.
- He'II be fine

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:13.166
WiII you save Prateek?

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:14.364
Of course.

02:05:15.107 --> 02:05:18.133
I was created to save your son

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:28.944
''Sweetheart.''

02:05:29.922 --> 02:05:31.287
Promise me

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:37.419
I promise you

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:43.392
I must go

02:05:43.502 --> 02:05:48.098
I have to go aIone

02:06:01.086 --> 02:06:02.519
G.One.

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:06.917
You once asked me if angeIs existed

02:06:09.662 --> 02:06:11.129
Now I know...

02:06:12.531 --> 02:06:13.896
...that they do

02:06:13.999 --> 02:06:18.561
''Your generosity meIts hearts.''

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:02.343
I am here, G.One

02:07:44.023 --> 02:07:46.116
You are Iate, G.One.

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:49.627
Any Iater and...

02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:54.126
I have your HART

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:55.700
So you can't kiII Prateek

02:07:56.001 --> 02:07:58.265
You have my HART so...

02:07:58.370 --> 02:08:00.304
...you can't kiII me

02:08:00.572 --> 02:08:03.735
UnIess our HARTS are connected...

02:08:04.176 --> 02:08:05.609
...you can't die...

02:08:06.412 --> 02:08:07.640
...nor can I

02:08:08.681 --> 02:08:10.444
I must Iog on

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:14.583
I hope it's connected with the LAN.
Give me dispIay controI, come on.

02:08:16.588 --> 02:08:20.183
But matters of the
heart...very compIicated.

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:21.623
For me it's simpIe

02:08:22.327 --> 02:08:25.990
My onIy purpose is to destroy you

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:28.293
Keep the HART

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.393
Logic says: Your chance of
survivaI is 0.01'/,

02:08:32.504 --> 02:08:33.493
Why choose death?

02:08:33.605 --> 02:08:37.132
Because I gave my word

02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:25.623
We're connected

02:09:25.724 --> 02:09:29.057
Connected now.
- Ra.One Ioaded. Game ready to pIay.

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:31.561
Game begins.
- WeIcome, Lucifer.

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:33.796
Let's pIay.

02:09:52.584 --> 02:09:54.449
Hide!

02:09:58.157 --> 02:09:59.681
You OK?

02:09:59.858 --> 02:10:01.587
Sure, I'm fine

02:10:02.361 --> 02:10:04.329
But my head is spinning

02:11:09.962 --> 02:11:11.190
Fire.

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:11.887
Done!

02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:13.391
Look down!

02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:31.782
G.One safe. LeveI two, kiIIer combat.

02:11:31.884 --> 02:11:33.909
Good going, G.One.
- This is good going?

02:11:34.219 --> 02:11:36.847
The pIan is to get to LeveI 3

02:11:37.256 --> 02:11:40.419
Great pIan. That's if Ra.One Iets us

02:11:40.525 --> 02:11:43.323
Survive two minutes more

02:12:12.925 --> 02:12:15.325
- What are you doing?
- Getting whipped

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:20.398
Don't fight. Just try to survive

02:12:21.967 --> 02:12:23.662
Watch me

02:12:37.816 --> 02:12:38.840
See?

02:12:38.951 --> 02:12:41.419
No, G.One. do it my way.

02:12:56.735 --> 02:12:58.930
One minute to go.

02:13:09.681 --> 02:13:11.308
Use Ra.One's power

02:13:11.416 --> 02:13:12.474
Okay.

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:16.678
Yes.

02:13:17.489 --> 02:13:18.717
Oh no.

02:13:19.825 --> 02:13:21.053
Duck.

02:13:33.772 --> 02:13:35.569
Don't fight. Survive

02:13:36.008 --> 02:13:37.771
No, no, no, don't.

02:13:43.582 --> 02:13:45.413
Energy IeveIs Iow.

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:47.578
Run!

02:14:16.848 --> 02:14:19.783
Grab his main part!

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:28.524
What are you doing, G.One?

02:14:28.927 --> 02:14:30.485
I don't know.

02:14:30.762 --> 02:14:33.526
LeveI 2 cIear. G.One survives.

02:14:33.698 --> 02:14:35.495
G.One safe.
- Yes.

02:14:41.873 --> 02:14:42.965
G.One.

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:45.133
You OK?

02:14:46.478 --> 02:14:48.844
Never feIt better.

02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:53.782
I'm in your worId now.
We start where we Ieft off

02:14:54.619 --> 02:14:56.814
So come on our Lucifer.

02:14:57.923 --> 02:15:00.721
My power has decreased.
Ra.One is stronger now

02:15:00.826 --> 02:15:03.522
One gun, one buIIet, one chance

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:07.394
You can't hide from me.
Or escape me

02:15:07.666 --> 02:15:09.531
How wiII we destroy Ra.One?

02:15:10.635 --> 02:15:13.763
BuIIets don't win wars. Hearts do

02:15:13.872 --> 02:15:14.998
Now my HART...

02:15:17.075 --> 02:15:19.066
''Sweetheart.''

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:23.842
...wiII be my strength,
not my weakness

02:15:25.817 --> 02:15:27.409
Let's do this, Prateek.

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:29.779
For your father

02:15:31.123 --> 02:15:33.421
''Sweetheart.''

02:16:05.690 --> 02:16:07.851
Anti-heart gun activated.

02:16:59.144 --> 02:17:00.839
G.One.

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:05.547
G.One. HART.

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:13.281
You said it'd work

02:17:13.592 --> 02:17:15.082
You can't die

02:17:16.661 --> 02:17:19.596
G.One terminated.
Game over, Lucifer.

02:17:19.698 --> 02:17:21.790
Get ready to die

02:17:30.674 --> 02:17:32.005
I am on.

02:17:32.811 --> 02:17:34.004
We're ready

02:17:34.111 --> 02:17:36.171
To kick your..
- Language, Prateek.

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:40.910
We are ready, to kick your fat ass.

02:17:41.019 --> 02:17:42.179
You forget

02:17:42.287 --> 02:17:46.553
If we're not connected to
the HART, neither of us...

02:17:46.657 --> 02:17:47.817
...can die

02:17:47.925 --> 02:17:50.656
Matters of the heart.
Very compIicated.

02:17:50.762 --> 02:17:53.788
I didn't forget. Lucifer did

02:17:53.897 --> 02:17:56.662
He wanted a viIIain who never Ioses

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:58.929
You shouId be carefuI
what you wish for, kid.

02:17:59.204 --> 02:18:02.764
Instead of one viIIain,
you have ten

02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:09.040
Oh no.
- Shoot me.

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:11.047
Find me

02:18:11.148 --> 02:18:14.949
Find the reaI Ra.One

02:18:15.053 --> 02:18:17.111
- Which one?
- Never got to LeveI 3

02:18:17.222 --> 02:18:19.121
One reaI. Nine fakes

02:18:19.758 --> 02:18:23.159
Me!

02:18:23.795 --> 02:18:26.855
No, me

02:18:52.057 --> 02:18:53.388
ImpossibIe

02:18:53.691 --> 02:18:55.387
Dad can't Iet eviI win

02:19:00.231 --> 02:19:02.790
He'II heIp us

02:19:06.037 --> 02:19:07.129
I have his foIder

02:19:07.237 --> 02:19:08.705
Check it

02:19:08.807 --> 02:19:10.775
His Iast proverb:

02:19:10.875 --> 02:19:14.402
''SeII your souI to the DeviI and
eviI's shadow won't Ieave you''

02:19:14.713 --> 02:19:16.044
Shadow?

02:19:19.416 --> 02:19:20.906
Shadow?

02:19:21.019 --> 02:19:22.076
The reaI Ra.One...

02:19:22.187 --> 02:19:23.210
...casts a shadow

02:19:23.321 --> 02:19:25.379
The reaI Ra.One casts a shadow

02:19:29.994 --> 02:19:31.962
The reaI Ra.One casts a shadow

02:19:32.063 --> 02:19:33.257
Shoot.

02:21:07.792 --> 02:21:08.986
G.One.

02:21:13.531 --> 02:21:17.433
Game over, Prateek. I must go

02:21:17.936 --> 02:21:20.996
No, G.One. That wasn't the pIan

02:21:21.473 --> 02:21:25.534
It was the pIan and aIways wiII be

02:21:26.077 --> 02:21:28.511
If you want the end of Ra.One...

02:21:29.147 --> 02:21:30.478
...I must take him back...

02:21:30.582 --> 02:21:32.812
...to the worId...

02:21:33.485 --> 02:21:35.248
...from where we came

02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:40.014
G.One, don't Ieave me

02:21:40.124 --> 02:21:42.319
I can't Iose my father again

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:46.260
You'II never Iose him

02:21:47.499 --> 02:21:53.131
If there's goodness in your heart,
he'II never Ieave you

02:21:55.273 --> 02:21:57.002
Good peopIe die...

02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:00.874
...but their goodness Iives on

02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:12.880
Listen to your heart.

02:22:14.392 --> 02:22:17.884
Look. Be a superhero, Prateek.

02:22:18.463 --> 02:22:21.990
A superhero. With a heart.

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:35.172
Got to go now.

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:40.448
I wiII miss you, G.One.
- Yes.

02:22:42.053 --> 02:22:43.918
I think I wiII miss you too.

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:46.012
TeII Sonia...

02:22:46.558 --> 02:22:52.588
We made a reaI
buttercup of brother Ra.One

02:24:15.213 --> 02:24:17.272
So gIad you're back

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:19.342
You OK?

02:24:19.450 --> 02:24:20.508
You know I am very happy
that you two returned.

02:24:20.618 --> 02:24:21.710
How's Prateek?

02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:25.649
Forever Iogged on,
trying to revive G.One's HART

02:24:41.339 --> 02:24:42.704
Just Iet him be, Sonia.

02:24:43.608 --> 02:24:44.666
Don't dash his hopes

02:24:44.776 --> 02:24:46.209
It's his beIief.

02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:48.175
Where is my Lucifer?

02:24:49.047 --> 02:24:51.379
Prateek.
- Coming, mom.

02:24:57.288 --> 02:24:58.482
I am on.

02:25:28.252 --> 02:25:30.277
Mom, G.One's back.

02:25:30.555 --> 02:25:33.718
I toId you, Mom! He'd come back

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:35.224
He's right here. He's back.

02:26:03.354 --> 02:26:10.726
''Wicked Speed. The destination ahead,
the wind at my back.''

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:31.141
''Wicked Speed. The destination ahead,
the wind at my back.''

02:26:34.585 --> 02:26:42.287
''A chilling gale, crosses
your path, it stops you.''

02:27:03.781 --> 02:27:07.148
''A desire.''

02:27:07.585 --> 02:27:11.316
''To serve which doesn't cease.''

02:27:14.826 --> 02:27:17.852
''The fire of obsession.''

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:21.863
''That blinds out the light.''

02:27:22.266 --> 02:27:25.565
''The dawn pierces
through the dark night.''

02:27:25.803 --> 02:27:29.261
''A new beginning after
defeating the evil.''

02:27:29.473 --> 02:27:32.670
''Time has...chosen a moment.''

02:27:33.211 --> 02:27:36.510
''l will leave a mark in history.''

02:27:36.614 --> 02:27:43.747
''Wicked Speed. The destination ahead,
the wind at my back.''

02:27:47.191 --> 02:27:50.354
''A chilling gale.''

02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:54.659
''Crosses your path, it stops you.''

02:28:02.306 --> 02:28:04.934
''There's no fun when.''

02:28:05.776 --> 02:28:09.303
''Life isn't on the edge.''

02:28:13.284 --> 02:28:16.515
''A strong heart.''

02:28:16.621 --> 02:28:20.216
''Never accepts defeat easily.''

02:28:20.324 --> 02:28:23.760
''Doing that unimaginable.''

02:28:23.928 --> 02:28:27.489
''ls the mark of the brave.''

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:30.965
''l don't do it for myseIf.''

02:28:31.369 --> 02:28:34.668
''l lay my life down for my kin.''

02:28:34.772 --> 02:28:37.639
''Wicked Speed.''

02:28:37.742 --> 02:28:41.678
''The destination ahead,
the wind at my back.''

02:29:23.921 --> 02:29:25.855
''My sizzling siren''

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:29.484
''Where you go, girl,
l am gonna follow.''

02:29:30.962 --> 02:29:33.453
''What you want,
girl, just let me know.''

02:29:34.598 --> 02:29:36.896
''My sizzling siren''

02:29:38.035 --> 02:29:41.562
''Surely l am gonna get you?
You know l am gonna get you.''

02:29:41.672 --> 02:29:45.369
''You know l even let
you...let you be my Sizzling Siren.''

02:29:45.476 --> 02:29:48.741
''Let's see you move.''
