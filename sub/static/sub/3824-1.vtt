01:09.819 --> 01:12.906
<i>Wow, you're Danny Collins.</i>

01:12.989 --> 01:13.990
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:14.074 --> 01:15.617
<i>Jesus H!</i>

01:15.658 --> 01:17.535
<i>You mind if we listen while we talk?</i>

01:17.619 --> 01:18.953
<i>Sure.</i>

01:50.694 --> 01:53.196
- Is this cool?
- Sure.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.413
Smoke?

02:01.496 --> 02:02.997
No. No, thanks.

02:04.708 --> 02:09.628
Well, the album's going to be
massive, kid. Who got you there?

02:11.214 --> 02:12.215
I'm sorry?

02:12.340 --> 02:14.718
Your influences, who do you dig?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.219
Who makes you hard?

02:17.429 --> 02:18.471
Oh.

02:18.555 --> 02:22.684
Well, um,
I guess, I... If I had to think...

02:22.726 --> 02:24.019
Hold on.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.816
June 30th, 1971.

02:29.899 --> 02:35.030
Guy DeLoach with the apparently
pre-pubescent Danny Collins.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.656
For <i>Chime Mag.</i>

02:40.827 --> 02:43.079
More than anything, it's your writing.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.923
You write like fucking Lennon, man.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.221
That's, um...
Thank you.

03:00.513 --> 03:06.019
I guess he's probably the one who, um,
you know, makes me the hardest.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.400
Jesus H!

03:14.694 --> 03:17.030
Well, you're going to be huge, kid.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.784
Richer than rich. Famous as shit.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.827
More women than you know what to do with.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.622
I'm telling you this, and I've got to ask,

03:27.540 --> 03:32.087
why are you sitting there staring at me
looking like that information

03:32.170 --> 03:34.798
scares the livin' shit outta you?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.097
Because it does.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.605
Jesus H!

03:52.065 --> 03:56.653
<i>Danny, Danny,
Danny, Danny, Danny.</i>

04:58.548 --> 04:59.716
Break a leg, Danny.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.051
Just tell me whose.

05:43.635 --> 05:48.014
<i>Hello, L.A.! It's good to be back!</i>

05:49.307 --> 05:50.684
Danny!

05:55.897 --> 05:59.984
<i>Hey, baby doll
What's goin' on?</i>

06:03.321 --> 06:08.660
<i>Sweet baby doll
I'll sing my song!</i>

06:08.743 --> 06:10.495
<i>For you!</i>

06:12.455 --> 06:15.792
<i>You were strong when I was weak</i>

06:16.209 --> 06:19.671
<i>With a kiss upon my cheek</i>

06:20.130 --> 06:25.844
<i>We could fly so far away from here</i>

06:25.927 --> 06:28.138
<i>My baby!</i>

06:28.263 --> 06:29.681
<i>Baby!</i>

06:30.181 --> 06:32.517
<i>Hey, baby doll!</i>

06:32.600 --> 06:34.352
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

06:37.772 --> 06:44.696
<i>Sweet baby doll
I'll sing my song for you!</i>

06:45.488 --> 06:47.741
<i>Hey, baby doll!</i>

06:47.824 --> 06:50.660
<i>What's going on...</i>

06:55.498 --> 06:56.833
Excuse me, Mr. Collins?

06:56.875 --> 06:59.085
Do you think I could bother you
for a quick picture?

06:59.169 --> 07:02.797
Just real quick.
Real quick, my mom will die.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.090
I hope not.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.592
Ah.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.136
- Ah, awesome.
- Beauty...

07:08.178 --> 07:10.347
- I will tweet this to you.
- Awesome.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.503
It was a good show tonight, kid.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.562
Awesome.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.941
Hey, Sylvia Plath, you okay?

07:22.025 --> 07:24.944
If what I just did qualified as singing,
I'd be great.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.783
- Mmm.
- You know...

07:29.866 --> 07:31.576
Little birthday blues, I guess.

07:31.951 --> 07:32.952
Uh-huh.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.163
All right, everyone.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.123
My guy needs a little rest here.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.416
Bye, Danny.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.129
Sally, thank you for coming, honey.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.882
Tell your dad I said hello, Kate.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.513
See those Golden Girls in the front row?

07:51.554 --> 07:52.555
Mmm.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.350
Eating the licorice the entire show.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.394
Can't choose your fans, Danny.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.436
Three of them.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.564
Each one older than the next.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.275
Made one pack of licorice
last the whole show.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.986
Just sat there gummin' it for two hours.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.658
New billboard went up on Sunset.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.536
You should check it out
on your way home, yeah?

08:15.870 --> 08:17.414
All right, enough of this crap.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.709
So, your birthday's tomorrow.
Is that your big problem?

08:20.959 --> 08:25.255
Pregnant women in Africa,
feeding half their village from their titties.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.590
Those ladies got problems. Not you.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.426
- You're so right.
- Yeah.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.344
Of course I'm right, I'm always right.

08:31.553 --> 08:35.432
So you go home now to your stunning,
half-your-age fiancée

08:35.765 --> 08:39.561
who insists on throwing you
this massive surprise party tomorrow,

08:39.602 --> 08:41.938
which I didn't just tell you about,

08:42.022 --> 08:46.943
and then go tell the sore-titted
African ladies your problems.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.611
Okay?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.197
Okay.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.534
See you at my surprise party, buddy.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.955
- Hey.
- Yeah?

08:59.372 --> 09:02.042
It was a good show tonight, kid.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.126
Really.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.380
Okay.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.784
We'll have to get that fixed for you,
Mr. Collins. How was the show?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.812
I'm home!

10:37.512 --> 10:38.513
Babe?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.766
I'm in the shower.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.476
Listen, I'll be out in a minute.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.061
I'm just finishing shaving.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.564
What'd you do tonight?

10:48.231 --> 10:50.316
Just busywork around here.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.819
You're always doing busywork.

10:52.902 --> 10:56.781
We have a big house.
Running it keeps a girl busy, right?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.825
Oh, uh, hon?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.160
Yeah, just a second.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.123
You know... Uh, Jesus, Sophie.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.416
What?

11:07.083 --> 11:09.878
Okay. The kid out front?

11:09.919 --> 11:12.088
Could you maybe say something to him?

11:12.213 --> 11:16.593
Because I don't need a half-hour of
chit-chat every time I pull into my house.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.723
He's your fan, he's just
trying to impress you.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.139
Well, he's failing.

11:21.222 --> 11:24.267
I'm gonna go rest before my surprise party.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.604
God damn it, fucking Frank!

11:28.438 --> 11:30.106
Surprise!

11:30.440 --> 11:32.942
Oh, no! No way!

11:33.026 --> 11:34.652
You did this.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.030
Aw.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.992
You guys should know better, you know,
you don't surprise a guy my age.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.276
You'll give me a heart attack.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.456
She looks like a young Jackie O.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.960
I look absurd with her.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.211
Yes, you do.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.592
We have to make her
sign a prenup, don't we?

12:39.676 --> 12:40.844
Yes, we do.

12:46.641 --> 12:50.770
I'm way too old to be putting
this much shit up my nose.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.188
Yes, you are.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.732
Jesus, Frank,

12:53.815 --> 12:56.901
don't give me
all the good stuff at once, will ya.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.863
You're really earning
that 10% tonight, pal.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.489
What do you want me to say?

13:01.573 --> 13:02.866
Oh, no, Danny,

13:02.949 --> 13:06.953
you look perfectly normal
standing next to a coked-up teenager

13:07.037 --> 13:11.416
who can't keep her nipples covered
for more than five minutes.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.252
Prenup? Who needs a prenup?

13:14.336 --> 13:16.588
I mean, sure,
you've gone through three wives already,

13:17.213 --> 13:20.091
but this one seems like the real deal.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.509
Oh, look,

13:21.593 --> 13:23.887
I can see her vagina again.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.598
That's cute.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.017
Thank you, I try.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.270
So,

13:32.562 --> 13:35.690
I know how fanatical you are about Lennon.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.443
So I started futzing
around on the Internet,

13:38.526 --> 13:42.906
and I, uh, get in touch with this one guy.
He's a collector.

13:44.157 --> 13:48.578
I tell him that I'm looking
to get you something special.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.538
Holy shit.

13:52.123 --> 13:55.126
I've been holding onto
this for three months.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.171
No, no, no. Wait, wait. Hang on, wait.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.174
You remember doing an interview
when you were a kid?

14:01.424 --> 14:04.719
Something called, uh, <i>Chime Magazine.</i>

14:04.761 --> 14:05.762
Fella named DeLoach?

14:07.180 --> 14:10.433
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know. Yeah.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.851
Well, I don't know what
you said to the guy,

14:11.935 --> 14:13.937
I mean, you must've mentioned
Lennon or something.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.481
But that doesn't matter, the point is

14:16.564 --> 14:18.441
Lennon read it.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.443
The interview.

14:20.944 --> 14:21.945
And...

14:23.029 --> 14:24.030
He wrote you a letter.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.409
What the hell are you talking about?

14:27.992 --> 14:32.247
John Lennon wrote you a letter, pal,

14:32.330 --> 14:34.249
in 1971.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.711
He sent it to you care of this DeLoach guy.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.129
Now DeLoach smells money,

14:39.212 --> 14:42.507
so he holds onto it, never tells you.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.718
Then DeLoach dies.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.470
But he's not the point, the point is

14:47.846 --> 14:50.265
he sold that letter

14:50.306 --> 14:52.183
to a collector.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.144
Can you believe this shit?

14:54.769 --> 14:56.187
I'm not following this, Frank.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.816
Open the box. Open the box.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.701
John Lennon wrote you
a handwritten letter in 1971.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.370
Can you fucking believe it?

15:12.454 --> 15:13.455
Read it!

15:19.461 --> 15:21.880
"Dear Danny Collins.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.342
"Yoko and I read your interview.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.846
"Being rich and famous
doesn't change the way you think.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.016
"It doesn't corrupt your art.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.352
"Only you can do that.

15:36.019 --> 15:39.898
"So, what do you think about that,
Danny Collins?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.151
"Stay true..."

15:44.194 --> 15:46.029
"...to your music.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.947
"Stay true to yourself.

15:48.823 --> 15:52.035
"My phone number is below.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.829
"Call me, we can discuss this.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.541
"We can help.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.713
"Love, John."

16:05.840 --> 16:07.759
It's crazy, right?

16:08.635 --> 16:11.805
I've been holding onto this for months now.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.065
I'm home!

17:54.824 --> 17:56.493
Whatcha doin'?

17:56.993 --> 17:58.620
- Packing.
- Oh.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.413
Where are we going?

18:01.164 --> 18:02.582
We're not going anywhere.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.876
But I'm going away.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.170
Where you going?

18:08.171 --> 18:09.631
Where?

18:10.006 --> 18:11.007
Where is he?

18:11.675 --> 18:12.801
Who?

18:12.884 --> 18:15.387
Whoever you were just in bed with.
That's who.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.722
Danny, I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.516
Come on, Sophie.

18:20.392 --> 18:22.352
I didn't pull in the way I usually do,

18:22.435 --> 18:25.772
so the kid outside couldn't call you
and stall me.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.858
Okay, listen. I'm not mad, I promise you.
I am not mad.

18:28.942 --> 18:32.654
I just want to know who the fuck
is in my house. That's all.

18:32.696 --> 18:36.950
Hey! Wherever you are, it's okay,
I promise, I'm not mad.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.662
I just wanna see your face.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.038
Jesus, just come out.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.207
It's okay.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.467
Busywork.

18:54.759 --> 18:55.760
Judd.

18:55.844 --> 18:56.845
No, "Busywork."

18:56.928 --> 18:59.723
I'm going to call you Busywork
because she's always doing busywork.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.599
Now, I understand.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.228
Okay, kids, you and Busywork here,

19:05.395 --> 19:07.897
I want you to stay here for a while,
if you wish.

19:07.939 --> 19:10.608
It's fine by me. You're young, have fun.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.611
I'm looking for my address book.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.655
'Cause I need an address
in my address book,

19:15.739 --> 19:17.574
- and I found it.

19:18.742 --> 19:19.743
Sophie.

19:23.496 --> 19:27.208
I was going to make you
sign a prenup anyway.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.462
You know, so you're not
missing out on the big bucks.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.714
If that makes you feel better. Hmm?

19:33.965 --> 19:35.467
I guess it does a little.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.763
Okay, you guys, I'm off.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.765
And, Busywork?

19:43.600 --> 19:44.934
Um...

19:45.018 --> 19:47.103
Take care of her. Okay?

19:48.688 --> 19:51.858
My parents had their first dance
to one of your songs.

19:51.941 --> 19:52.942
- Sir.
- Yeah.

19:54.110 --> 19:57.197
Well, that's fucked up
in all kinds of ways now, isn't it?

19:58.698 --> 20:01.159
Hey, man. Uh, listen.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.119
I need a plane.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.455
Jersey.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.708
<i>Yeah, New Jersey.</i>

20:10.293 --> 20:13.630
<i>Yeah. A car, uh, you know what I like.</i>

20:13.963 --> 20:16.049
<i>Mmm. Make it red.</i>

20:16.216 --> 20:18.968
Yeah. I'm changing shit up.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.978
What are you doing?

20:29.020 --> 20:30.480
It's just dead.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.650
There's a dental convention here this week.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.819
Like four people have been here.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.654
Oh, shit!

20:45.829 --> 20:48.081
Oh, shit!

20:48.373 --> 20:50.250
Oh, nice!

20:51.334 --> 20:53.670
Welcome to the Hilton, Danny Collins.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.631
I mean, Mr. Collins. I mean, uh...

20:56.673 --> 20:58.633
Welcome to the Hilton, sir.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.552
It's good to be here at the Hilton.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.096
You can call me Danny.
And what should I call you?

21:03.304 --> 21:05.056
Uh, Nicky Ernst.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.559
Nicky Ernst. Absolute pleasure to meet you.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.352
You got a great face, Nicky.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.021
May I give you 100 bucks?

21:12.522 --> 21:15.275
Try not to drool on the car, Nicky.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.359
Okay.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.613
Welcome to the Hilton,
do you have a reservation?

21:20.697 --> 21:21.781
No.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.366
But I hope that's not a deal breaker

21:23.450 --> 21:26.494
because I am rapidly falling in love
with this here Hilton.

21:26.536 --> 21:28.038
Holy shit!

21:28.621 --> 21:29.748
Holy shit!

21:30.206 --> 21:32.625
I get that a lot. What's your name?

21:33.001 --> 21:36.171
- Um, uh, Jamie.
- Jamie. I'm Danny.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.048
Yeah, I know who you are.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.291
How about that guy out front?

21:39.382 --> 21:41.843
Nicky Ernst. He's a great guy, great face.

21:41.885 --> 21:45.013
Why don't you let him
take you out for a ride in my car?

21:45.055 --> 21:46.473
- You'll fall in love.
- Oh.

21:46.556 --> 21:47.891
Okay. Okay.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.517
Look at that face.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.895
Why does everybody in here
have such great faces?

21:51.978 --> 21:54.064
And so young. Why are you all so young?

21:54.147 --> 21:58.276
We're just college kids. Just graduated.
I'm off for the summer.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.569
That explains it.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.071
Uh...

22:01.112 --> 22:03.239
How long will you be staying with us,
Mr. Collins?

22:03.281 --> 22:05.742
I don't know. My GPS tells me

22:05.784 --> 22:08.620
that this is not far from
a Hillsdale, New Jersey.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.164
Now, is my GPS lying
or giving me the straight shit?

22:11.581 --> 22:13.958
Straight shit. You're five minutes away.

22:14.084 --> 22:17.212
- Okay, I will stay here. Indefinitely.
- Um...

22:17.504 --> 22:18.838
Hang on. Mary!

22:19.255 --> 22:21.966
Man, if another wonderful face
comes out of there,

22:22.092 --> 22:24.302
I don't think I can handle it.

22:24.928 --> 22:25.929
Oh.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.431
That's it. I definitely can't handle it.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.601
- Look who it is.
- I see.

22:31.685 --> 22:32.727
Hi.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.270
He wants to stay indefinitely

22:34.312 --> 22:35.438
and we can give him the honeymoon suite.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.523
He doesn't want the honeymoon suite.

22:36.815 --> 22:37.816
It's not my honeymoon.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.192
And I'm not very sweet.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.444
Any room will suit me fine.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.572
And what college do you go to, young lady?

22:44.906 --> 22:46.783
Ha!

22:51.121 --> 22:54.457
So, you're staying indefinitely? Here?

22:54.499 --> 22:56.543
I'm a huge fan of this Hilton.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.378
Are you married, Mary?

22:59.295 --> 23:00.338
Oh, I'm sorry?

23:00.463 --> 23:02.090
Are you currently betrothed?

23:02.507 --> 23:03.633
- No.
- Good.

23:03.883 --> 23:04.884
Dinner?

23:05.260 --> 23:06.636
You're asking me to dinner?

23:06.845 --> 23:09.931
Yes. I think so.
Jamie? I asked her to dinner, didn't I?

23:09.973 --> 23:12.308
- Yup, yeah, you did.
- Proof.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.643
I'm sorry, are you on drugs?

23:13.810 --> 23:15.311
Currently or in general?

23:15.520 --> 23:16.521
Currently?

23:16.813 --> 23:18.356
No. Dinner?

23:18.648 --> 23:20.191
No. I'm going to have to decline.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.317
You're not a fan?

23:21.651 --> 23:24.112
- Currently or in general?
- In general.

23:24.195 --> 23:25.989
- No.
- Oh, that's too bad.

23:26.114 --> 23:27.657
But we have good patter.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.827
Don't we? Don't we, Jamie?

23:30.869 --> 23:32.269
You following any of this, are you?

23:32.287 --> 23:34.831
- No.
- Look, I'll check you in, okay?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.667
While you're checking me in,
I'll check you out.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.296
Oh, my God.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.444
Ooh, ooh!

24:06.821 --> 24:11.326
You know, I never actually
saw this being done.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.036
Oh, oh, oh.

24:13.870 --> 24:15.872
Watch the door. Okay.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.907
- Danny?
- Hey.

24:51.574 --> 24:52.784
Frank.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.577
Oh, man.

24:54.619 --> 24:56.329
Come to papa.

24:56.413 --> 24:58.248
Good to see you, buddy.

24:58.289 --> 24:59.541
Oh, what a trip.

24:59.582 --> 25:01.418
I got on the first flight out.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.628
Thanks, Frank. You been here before?

25:03.753 --> 25:07.048
The bar at the Woodcliff Lake,
New Jersey Hilton?

25:07.090 --> 25:08.133
No.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.722
- Oh, man.
- I, uh...

25:14.764 --> 25:18.268
Spoke to Sophie. She said...

25:19.602 --> 25:20.603
I did. I did.

25:20.645 --> 25:21.855
Josh.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.733
You wanna give us ice water

25:24.983 --> 25:27.736
for my handsome young friend here?

25:33.616 --> 25:35.243
Frank, I decided,

25:35.910 --> 25:38.288
uh, to make some changes in my life.

25:40.582 --> 25:43.418
Some of the changes
may come as a bit of a shock.

25:43.460 --> 25:46.379
Some may actually affect you, financially.

25:46.463 --> 25:49.924
I'm here as your friend, Danny.
Not as your manager.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.303
I want to cancel the rest of the tour.

25:54.262 --> 25:55.305
I'm sorry?

25:55.430 --> 25:57.140
I'm not sorry.

25:57.307 --> 25:59.017
I'm done, Frank.

25:59.768 --> 26:00.810
Done.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.979
So, help me, God,

26:03.021 --> 26:06.775
I will never be forced to sing
those songs again.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.693
Danny, you're spiraling.

26:08.818 --> 26:10.820
Are you on something?
What are you taking?

26:10.945 --> 26:13.782
I'm done with all of that shit too.

26:13.823 --> 26:15.075
No more, no more drinking,

26:15.158 --> 26:16.159
no more drugging.

26:16.201 --> 26:18.953
You're drinking right now, Danny.

26:20.163 --> 26:21.664
True.

26:21.706 --> 26:24.000
Let's forget about what
I said about drinking.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.503
I mean, I'm not running for Pope.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.171
And this is because of Sophie?

26:30.465 --> 26:31.966
Frank, please.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.511
Give me a little credit, will ya? Sophie?

26:38.848 --> 26:40.684
Okay. What would have happened

26:40.809 --> 26:43.353
if I got that letter
when I was supposed to?

26:44.062 --> 26:45.689
I would have called him.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.358
For sure as shit, I would have called him.

26:50.068 --> 26:53.029
Maybe my whole life
would have turned out different.

26:53.154 --> 26:54.572
Don't... Don't...

26:54.698 --> 26:57.575
You're too hard on yourself, kid.
You always have been. Now, come on.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.119
Frank.

26:59.703 --> 27:03.790
I haven't written a song in 30 years.
Thirty years.

27:04.749 --> 27:06.626
I'm a fucking joke.

27:08.712 --> 27:10.380
I'm an MC.

27:11.548 --> 27:14.884
A fuckin' court jester with a microphone.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.180
I was the real thing once.

27:19.556 --> 27:22.809
Right. I was the real thing.

27:22.892 --> 27:25.145
One album, my songs didn't sell,

27:25.854 --> 27:29.107
they handed me their songs to sing.
And I sung.

27:29.733 --> 27:31.484
- Mmm.
- I gave up.

27:31.776 --> 27:35.071
Danny, you're having a breakdown.

27:35.196 --> 27:39.242
I hate to tell you, buddy.
I've been breaking down for 40 years.

27:39.284 --> 27:41.578
I'm broken. Ain't nothin' left to break.

27:43.455 --> 27:46.916
I've been abusing my body
for the better part of four decades.

27:49.252 --> 27:51.963
If I'm going to find any
kind of redemption,

27:54.132 --> 27:56.801
I can't waste any more time.

27:59.095 --> 28:01.222
But why the fuck New Jersey?

28:02.766 --> 28:05.101
One shock at a time, Frank.

28:09.481 --> 28:10.774
Hey, Jamie.

28:10.899 --> 28:14.819
You talk to that kid Nicky Ernst
about that ride yet?

28:14.903 --> 28:16.112
Not yet, Mr. Collins.

28:16.446 --> 28:17.906
You got to do it.

28:17.947 --> 28:19.908
Uh, meet me at 7:00 for dinner.

28:19.949 --> 28:21.284
Still going to have to pass.

28:21.409 --> 28:22.744
Mary, you keep passing,

28:22.786 --> 28:25.622
I'll keep making passes
and we'll see who quits first.

28:26.081 --> 28:27.749
Have a nice day, Mr. Collins.

28:27.791 --> 28:31.836
Big day. Big day for me.
I'm meeting someone for the first time.

28:32.295 --> 28:33.797
How do I look?

28:35.131 --> 28:36.758
Honestly?

28:36.841 --> 28:38.677
If this relationship is
going to go the distance, Mary,

28:38.802 --> 28:40.562
I think we should
be honest with one another.

28:40.970 --> 28:43.223
Okay. Well,

28:43.306 --> 28:45.016
you look slightly ridiculous.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.895
Nah. I look sharp.

28:49.646 --> 28:51.940
- See you at 7:00.
- No, you won't.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.109
Hey, Jamie, don't forget about Nicky.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.444
He's a wonderful boy.

28:58.446 --> 28:59.864
Don't say anything to anyone.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.158
Nicky Ernst!

29:02.200 --> 29:03.243
It's ready for you, sir.

29:03.326 --> 29:05.620
Oh, man, I don't know what you did
to that girl inside,

29:05.662 --> 29:09.874
but, wow, all she does is talk about you.
Maybe you should ask her out.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.710
- Jamie?
- That's the one.

29:13.461 --> 29:15.880
Don't go after Mary. Mary's mine.

29:47.162 --> 29:48.538
I like your lawn.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.208
Thank you.

30:05.680 --> 30:06.681
Hello!

30:09.559 --> 30:10.560
Hello.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.979
Hope, you're not to
open the door to strangers.

30:13.063 --> 30:16.983
He's not a stranger, we saw him on TV.

30:17.067 --> 30:19.069
- Told you.
- Whoa!

30:19.152 --> 30:21.738
I told you.

30:21.821 --> 30:25.033
You didn't listen,
but I tried to tell you.

30:25.075 --> 30:28.411
I was unsure of, um, what was appropriate.

30:28.495 --> 30:29.662
He's at work.

30:29.913 --> 30:32.499
I brought bagels.

30:34.918 --> 30:37.754
One, two, three...

30:37.879 --> 30:43.343
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
came up the water spout</i>

30:43.426 --> 30:44.594
Yeah.

30:44.678 --> 30:50.725
<i>Down came the rain
and it washed the spider out</i>

30:51.434 --> 30:56.940
<i>Out came the sun and dried up all the rain</i>

30:57.649 --> 31:02.404
<i>And the itsy-bitsy spider</i>

31:02.445 --> 31:06.783
<i>Climbed up the spout again</i>

31:06.950 --> 31:10.620
That's beautiful.
You have a natural singing voice.

31:12.122 --> 31:13.581
Oh, my God.

31:13.623 --> 31:15.083
Just comes out naturally.

31:15.125 --> 31:16.960
How did you find us?

31:17.752 --> 31:19.045
Oh, well, you know,

31:19.129 --> 31:21.798
I had tracked him down years ago, you know,

31:21.881 --> 31:25.301
just never got the nerve up to,
uh, come see him.

31:27.137 --> 31:28.179
I want a bagel.

31:28.555 --> 31:29.848
Can I have a bagel, Mom?

31:29.973 --> 31:32.726
Yeah. Okay. Let me just...

31:32.809 --> 31:35.645
Wow. On so many levels. Wow.

31:35.729 --> 31:37.772
How far along are you?

31:37.897 --> 31:39.733
With... Oh, um...

31:40.150 --> 31:41.651
- Six months, more or less.
- Oh.

31:42.444 --> 31:44.738
Uh, boy or girl? You know?

31:45.280 --> 31:46.406
It's a boy.

31:46.573 --> 31:49.617
Oh. Boy. Wow.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.453
On so many levels.

31:55.123 --> 31:57.167
I have to call him.
I mean, I have to call him.

31:57.292 --> 31:58.960
Oh, yeah, sure.

31:59.336 --> 32:01.004
Sure. Sure. Sure.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.423
I just finished the first grade.

32:03.673 --> 32:07.010
And my teacher is named Mrs. Williams.

32:07.594 --> 32:11.056
Her aunt died last week,
so we had a substitute.

32:11.348 --> 32:14.184
He had a mustache.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.518
She had a mustache?

32:15.602 --> 32:17.896
- He.
- Oh, it was a he. Oh, okay.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.856
Why are you on TV?

32:19.939 --> 32:21.900
Because I'm a singer.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.569
Are you a good singer?

32:24.652 --> 32:27.947
Well, I don't know, you know, not really.

32:28.031 --> 32:29.282
- I didn't think so.
- Hope.

32:29.366 --> 32:30.367
You didn't think so?

32:31.326 --> 32:35.205
And why didn't you think so?

32:35.288 --> 32:40.543
Because when you were on the TV,
my daddy said, "Shut it off, Samantha!"

32:40.627 --> 32:42.879
And Mommy turned it off really fast.

32:42.962 --> 32:46.966
And Mommy said, "Tom..."
And Daddy said, "N-O."

32:47.050 --> 32:49.427
And that was that.

32:49.761 --> 32:50.762
Wow.

32:50.845 --> 32:53.223
But I thought you were great. Really.

32:53.306 --> 32:54.891
You thought I was good?

32:54.974 --> 32:58.061
Danny Collins showed up at our house.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.145
Mmm-hmm.

32:59.646 --> 33:01.690
He's having bagels in
the kitchen with Hope.

33:01.773 --> 33:03.213
Why don't we take a break from that?

33:03.274 --> 33:04.859
Okay. Let's just color.

33:05.402 --> 33:07.654
Look at this. Startin' to get it.

33:07.737 --> 33:08.988
What was I supposed to do?

33:09.072 --> 33:10.949
Why don't you do it really slow?

33:11.032 --> 33:13.660
I do, yes, I do. Okay.

33:14.411 --> 33:16.538
- Bye, honey.
- Slowly makes it more...

33:16.579 --> 33:17.914
Didn't I already color that?

33:17.997 --> 33:20.375
You did. You told me that.

33:20.458 --> 33:21.501
Well, he's coming home.

33:21.918 --> 33:22.961
Yay!

33:23.044 --> 33:24.462
Daddy's coming home.

33:24.629 --> 33:27.716
That should be, uh, interesting.

33:27.924 --> 33:30.051
This is going to be interesting.

33:30.844 --> 33:34.055
- Mommy, look! It's <i>Yo Gabba Gabba!
</i>-I see it.

33:34.139 --> 33:37.934
The orange alien guy
has one eye just in the middle.

33:38.309 --> 33:40.478
Look, it's on TV!

33:40.770 --> 33:42.897
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hey, Hope. Settle. Calm.

33:44.899 --> 33:46.609
Thank you. Okay.

33:46.901 --> 33:51.364
Uh, she seems a little, uh, energetic.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.409
Or severely hyperactive.

33:54.451 --> 33:56.786
You know ADHD, it's the thing.

33:57.662 --> 34:00.540
Learning issues, behavioral stuff, all of it.

34:00.665 --> 34:04.044
We do the best we can, but it's a battle.

34:05.545 --> 34:07.339
Why are you here?

34:08.590 --> 34:10.091
Well, you know,

34:11.009 --> 34:12.594
I'm just, uh...

34:14.471 --> 34:16.097
Making some changes in my life.

34:17.599 --> 34:19.119
It's a little late for that, isn't it?

34:21.186 --> 34:24.647
Maybe. I don't know. I hope not.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.445
Tom's the best man I've ever met.

34:31.571 --> 34:33.072
He's solid,

34:33.739 --> 34:35.492
kind, funny.

34:35.533 --> 34:39.245
We've had one fight in 12 years,
we've had one serious fight.

34:41.121 --> 34:44.501
A couple years ago I got backstage passes
for one of your shows.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.668
I thought it was...

34:45.710 --> 34:50.340
You know, he should at least
meet you, right? After all this time?

34:51.549 --> 34:52.842
He disagreed.

34:54.260 --> 34:57.222
He disagreed strongly.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.600
So, this is not going to be pretty?

35:00.684 --> 35:02.811
I wouldn't think so, no.

35:02.852 --> 35:03.895
Okay.

35:06.564 --> 35:09.317
So, you think maybe, uh, you know,

35:09.401 --> 35:12.362
you could help grease the wheels a little?

35:12.404 --> 35:14.197
Mr. Collins.

35:15.740 --> 35:18.326
My parents are dead. His mom is, too.

35:18.451 --> 35:22.664
I mean, I would love for our children
to know their one remaining grandparent.

35:22.706 --> 35:26.501
I would love for my husband
to know his father.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.920
In a few minutes, my husband
is going to walk through that door

35:29.004 --> 35:33.842
and when he does, I feel pretty confident
this will be the last time I ever see you.

35:34.217 --> 35:38.930
And despite your celebrity,
and despite what I want for my own family,

35:39.014 --> 35:41.266
I will not try to stop that.

35:41.349 --> 35:43.059
You did this.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.854
You did this to yourself.

35:45.895 --> 35:48.023
Shame on you.

35:50.066 --> 35:51.359
That was good.

35:53.361 --> 35:54.904
Thanks. I've been practicing

35:54.988 --> 35:56.614
- since you gave me the bagels.

35:56.698 --> 35:59.576
It has a certain feel to it.

35:59.659 --> 36:01.077
Oh, he married well.

36:01.453 --> 36:04.748
- He did. I'm great.
- Yeah.

36:04.831 --> 36:06.499
See what you missed out on?

36:07.459 --> 36:09.002
Perfect daughter-in-law.

36:13.423 --> 36:14.632
Well...

36:19.429 --> 36:21.431
Daddy! Daddy!

36:21.765 --> 36:26.186
Look who it is, it's the man from TV!
It's the man from TV that we saw singing!

36:26.269 --> 36:28.271
- And Mommy said...
- Easy...

36:28.355 --> 36:30.940
And he brought bagels. He brought bagels.

36:31.024 --> 36:33.276
Mommy called you. And you're home early.

36:33.318 --> 36:35.445
Hope, your favorite flower is a...

36:35.528 --> 36:36.529
Rose.

36:36.613 --> 36:39.324
To smell it, you breathe through your...

36:40.533 --> 36:42.535
Keep it in, long as you can go.

36:43.119 --> 36:46.122
Then let it out in one big...

36:47.123 --> 36:49.167
...Blow.

36:51.753 --> 36:53.797
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, baby.

36:57.175 --> 36:58.968
Speak to you outside for a second?

36:59.803 --> 37:01.763
Of course. Sure.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.724
Okay.

37:05.392 --> 37:06.393
Um...

37:06.810 --> 37:08.645
If I have,

37:08.728 --> 37:11.439
I am truly very sorry,

37:11.481 --> 37:13.692
that I missed out on you.

37:15.902 --> 37:17.987
Thank you for the bagels.

37:18.363 --> 37:19.364
Okay.

37:19.489 --> 37:21.324
Hope, say goodbye to Mr. Collins.

37:21.408 --> 37:23.159
Goodbye, Mr. Collins.

37:23.201 --> 37:25.328
Mr. Collins, say goodbye to Hope.

37:28.373 --> 37:30.917
Goodbye to Hope.

37:36.006 --> 37:37.549
Come here.

37:45.348 --> 37:47.267
You're so tall.

37:48.518 --> 37:50.562
I'm sorry, what exactly do you want?

37:53.106 --> 37:55.442
- Well, you know...
- Are you sick?

37:55.525 --> 37:57.777
Is that what you're doing here?
Are you dying?

37:57.861 --> 37:59.529
No, I'm not sick.

38:01.865 --> 38:03.366
You have every right to be angry.

38:03.450 --> 38:06.453
No. No. I'm not angry. Really, I'm not.

38:06.536 --> 38:10.248
I'm a little confused,
and strangely, not interested.

38:10.707 --> 38:12.667
So, if you have anything to ask me,
just go ahead.

38:12.709 --> 38:15.712
'Cause this is the last time
we'll see each other.

38:17.964 --> 38:19.257
So, what do you do for a living?

38:19.382 --> 38:23.094
I work construction. Local, residential.

38:23.219 --> 38:25.722
It's not my dream job, but it's steady,

38:25.805 --> 38:28.558
and, you know,
Princeton wasn't exactly in the cards.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.601
What else?

38:29.726 --> 38:31.519
Your mom?

38:31.561 --> 38:32.896
She, uh...

38:32.979 --> 38:34.481
She died of cancer 10 years ago.

38:35.940 --> 38:38.651
Never married, never spoke about you

38:38.735 --> 38:41.404
except to say that it was a wild thing
she did when she was 23

38:41.446 --> 38:43.446
and got drunk backstage
after one of your concerts.

38:43.490 --> 38:45.617
I use her last name. Anything else?

38:45.742 --> 38:47.243
You're clearly angry.

38:47.285 --> 38:48.453
Look, I don't care enough to be angry.

38:48.578 --> 38:51.081
I am wondering what I'm going
to tell my little girl about who you are.

38:51.122 --> 38:53.249
And I'm thinking,
I have to be back at work in 20 minutes.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.085
Are we done here?

38:55.168 --> 38:56.169
I sent checks.

38:56.252 --> 38:57.671
- I ripped them up, okay?
- Okay.

38:57.754 --> 39:00.256
Okay. Nice to meet you. Have a good life.

39:01.591 --> 39:03.093
Are you happy?

39:03.301 --> 39:04.928
Am I happy?

39:05.637 --> 39:06.846
I don't know.

39:08.264 --> 39:10.433
You have a happy life?

39:15.605 --> 39:17.273
I hate my boss.

39:18.817 --> 39:21.277
Fucking Mets break my heart every year.

39:22.654 --> 39:26.032
But I have the most amazing wife
in the history of wives,

39:26.116 --> 39:28.118
and an amazing little girl.

39:28.159 --> 39:30.870
One that I wish I could do more for.
That I really wish I could do.

39:30.954 --> 39:33.081
But you know what,
if it makes you sleep better at night,

39:33.123 --> 39:34.666
yeah, I'm happy.

39:35.959 --> 39:38.628
And fuck you, you selfish prick, I am angry.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.886
Mr. Collins.

40:28.178 --> 40:30.430
- How we doing tonight?
- Oh.

40:31.681 --> 40:34.392
Peachy. Thank you for asking.

40:35.018 --> 40:38.063
Oh, good. I'm really glad to hear that.

40:38.146 --> 40:39.814
Mr. Collins,

40:39.856 --> 40:41.896
I was wondering if you could
help me with something.

40:42.359 --> 40:44.569
- Shoot.
- Okay.

40:44.694 --> 40:48.156
When a famous musician starts getting
fall-down drunk in a hotel bar

40:48.198 --> 40:50.158
and you're the manager of that hotel,

40:50.200 --> 40:53.536
is there a protocol
on how to handle the situation?

40:54.204 --> 40:55.330
Because actually,

40:55.372 --> 40:58.541
we have had a shortage of
famous fall-down drunk musicians lately,

40:58.667 --> 41:00.710
I'm a bit out of my depth.

41:03.588 --> 41:04.881
I see.

41:05.840 --> 41:09.386
Well, you know, I had a bad day.

41:09.511 --> 41:11.888
Oh. Okay.

41:12.013 --> 41:13.598
This is just water.

41:13.723 --> 41:15.225
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

41:15.350 --> 41:17.394
Yeah, that's just because
you drank all the booze

41:17.435 --> 41:18.895
and the ice is melted.

41:19.521 --> 41:22.107
Don't be mean to me.
I really had a bad day.

41:22.232 --> 41:23.233
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:24.901 --> 41:27.821
- Well, I had a bad day too.
- Yeah?

41:29.698 --> 41:31.116
Can I buy you a drink?

41:31.783 --> 41:33.743
Bay Breeze?

41:34.035 --> 41:36.788
Wine spritzer?
Maybe even one of those frozen...

41:36.913 --> 41:42.293
Josh, give me tequila, rocks,
something <i>añejo,</i> and a splash of soda.

41:42.377 --> 41:44.546
Right away, boss.

41:44.879 --> 41:47.549
You're not the only rock
star in this hotel.

41:47.590 --> 41:48.925
Apparently not.

41:50.969 --> 41:53.471
- So, you had a bad day?
- Mmm.

41:53.596 --> 41:55.265
Why'd you have a bad day?

41:57.308 --> 42:00.812
Okay, I work with a bunch of well-meaning...
Thank you.

42:00.937 --> 42:02.731
But remarkably dim twenty-somethings

42:02.772 --> 42:04.983
who are just passing time
until they go back to college.

42:05.108 --> 42:07.068
And one of them
screwed up the computer system

42:07.110 --> 42:11.614
and it took me half the day
to reprogram every reservation manually.

42:14.159 --> 42:16.286
Mmm. Ah.

42:18.288 --> 42:19.456
What about you?

42:21.916 --> 42:25.795
I tracked down my grown son,

42:25.920 --> 42:27.797
who I've never met before.

42:29.257 --> 42:34.179
I met him, his wife, my granddaughter.

42:35.472 --> 42:39.142
And then he told me, quite emphatically,

42:40.310 --> 42:43.772
to fuck off and to die.

42:48.026 --> 42:50.320
Well, it was every reservation,

42:50.445 --> 42:54.991
each one had to be reprogrammed manually.
I hope I made that clear.

42:57.035 --> 42:58.828
Can I ask you a question?

43:00.163 --> 43:04.376
Not if it's about why
I never met my son until today.

43:04.542 --> 43:07.295
Oh, shit. Well, that was my question.

43:19.849 --> 43:21.893
- We lost our patter.
- Mmm.

43:23.687 --> 43:24.688
It's gone.

43:24.813 --> 43:27.899
You know, I saw you in concert once,
about five years ago.

43:27.982 --> 43:31.403
- You did?
- Yeah, my husband... My ex-husband.

43:31.528 --> 43:35.240
He was a big fan. Oh, he loved it.

43:36.658 --> 43:38.034
And you?

43:39.494 --> 43:41.037
I appreciated your zeal.

43:41.705 --> 43:42.872
Oh, shit.

43:42.997 --> 43:45.709
What? Zeal is not awful.

43:45.792 --> 43:46.960
Zeal's not great.

43:48.003 --> 43:51.506
Hear us? "Zeal's not awful.
Zeal's not great."

43:51.548 --> 43:52.549
We got our patter back.

43:53.133 --> 43:56.386
How about that?
We should take this on the road.

43:56.469 --> 43:59.055
You and me. The new Nichols and May.

44:03.476 --> 44:06.229
Well, May and Nichols.
I would want top billing.

44:07.188 --> 44:08.398
You're good.

44:09.691 --> 44:10.692
I want to drink to you.

44:12.402 --> 44:13.695
Toast.

44:14.154 --> 44:15.238
Oh, okay.

44:15.321 --> 44:17.240
You'll have to come a little closer.

44:17.323 --> 44:20.076
- Oh, that was so good.
- See how I work it?

44:21.244 --> 44:23.913
What does that drink need?
It needs a lemon.

44:23.997 --> 44:24.998
No.

44:26.082 --> 44:27.417
<i>Then he writes,</i>

44:27.751 --> 44:30.086
"What do you think of that, Danny Collins?"

44:31.838 --> 44:32.881
John Lennon?

44:32.922 --> 44:35.522
John Lennon writes, "What do you think
about that, Danny Collins?"

44:35.550 --> 44:37.093
Yeah.

44:37.427 --> 44:39.220
Well, you know, John.

44:39.262 --> 44:44.934
I think, maybe, uh,
you should have sent the letter to my house.

44:45.060 --> 44:48.772
And then maybe I could have
avoided living such a bullshit life

44:48.897 --> 44:52.233
for the past 40 years,
that's what I think, John.

44:52.275 --> 44:55.028
Well, I might have that last sip.

44:56.363 --> 44:58.907
- I'm sorry. I'm a little giddy.
- Laughing, no...

44:58.948 --> 45:01.034
No, I just don't...
I usually don't drink this much.

45:01.117 --> 45:02.118
You've emptied it.

45:02.202 --> 45:03.402
I wonder if anyone's noticing.

45:03.453 --> 45:05.580
There's one of those people at the...

45:06.790 --> 45:11.294
No, the girl at the desk.
She's the one that screwed up the computer.

45:11.419 --> 45:13.213
- This is Danny Collins.
- Oh, geez.

45:13.296 --> 45:14.297
He's our guest.

45:14.381 --> 45:15.757
Do you have a name, sir?

45:15.799 --> 45:16.966
Uh, Hiroshi.

45:17.967 --> 45:20.220
That's nice, Hiroshi.

45:20.303 --> 45:21.304
Hiroshi.

45:21.388 --> 45:23.473
This is my daughter. She's 18.

45:23.556 --> 45:24.724
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

45:24.808 --> 45:26.226
- Wow.
- Don't say it like that.

45:28.228 --> 45:29.562
I'm ready.

45:29.646 --> 45:31.815
- Okay.
- Oh, my God!

45:31.940 --> 45:34.275
It just turns me on.

45:34.317 --> 45:36.152
<i>Rick and I split last year.</i>

45:36.486 --> 45:40.198
Most parents, they try to wait
till their kids leave for college.

45:40.323 --> 45:42.492
But we actually did the opposite.

45:42.575 --> 45:46.287
We tried to do it at the time that
it would really screw her up the most.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.169
<i>- Well, did it work?
- Yes. Yeah, perfect.</i>

45:53.294 --> 45:55.046
She's a complete mess, hates us both.

45:55.839 --> 45:57.465
- Guess what?
- What?

45:57.674 --> 45:59.801
She hates him more.

45:59.968 --> 46:02.387
Oh, that's perfect.

46:02.470 --> 46:07.809
My second wife actually was one of
the stars of <i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

46:09.352 --> 46:10.854
- Ginger?
- No.

46:11.354 --> 46:13.189
- Mary Ann?
- Yeah.

46:13.606 --> 46:15.859
- Wait, that's insane.
- I know.

46:15.942 --> 46:17.861
- You were married to Mary Ann?
- Yes.

46:17.986 --> 46:19.029
Oh, my God.

46:19.362 --> 46:20.488
So, what's she like?

46:20.989 --> 46:22.157
I don't remember.

46:23.533 --> 46:26.453
"...doesn't corrupt your art,
only you can do that.

46:27.037 --> 46:30.165
"So, what do you think about that,
Danny Collins?"

46:31.207 --> 46:33.043
- That is unreal.
- Yeah.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.503
You know, you better have something
to play me

46:35.587 --> 46:39.591
because if this is just a lame attempt
to get me to your room then...

46:42.719 --> 46:44.721
- I have something to play you. Yes.
- Oh.

46:45.055 --> 46:46.264
You're really going to play?

46:46.348 --> 46:48.850
Now, I haven't written anything
in a long time.

46:49.726 --> 46:51.770
And piano's not my first language.

46:52.687 --> 46:55.815
Piano's my first love,
but it's not my first language.

46:56.358 --> 46:58.109
- You're nervous.
- Yes.

46:58.193 --> 46:59.944
- I love that.
- So what?

47:00.236 --> 47:01.613
So bear with me.

47:17.629 --> 47:19.422
<i>It's spring</i>

47:19.923 --> 47:22.842
<i>In my mind</i>

47:25.178 --> 47:28.348
<i>But the autumn leaves</i>

47:29.015 --> 47:30.725
<i>They fall...</i>

47:37.273 --> 47:39.609
Oh, keep going. Keep going.

47:39.693 --> 47:41.986
That's it. That's as far as I got.

47:42.070 --> 47:46.533
Honestly, this kind of was just a lame
attempt to get you up to my room.

47:46.616 --> 47:48.284
Jesus Christ.

47:48.368 --> 47:50.870
- No, no, no, don't go now. Stay.
- Good night, Danny.

47:50.995 --> 47:53.873
Come on.
I'm an old man with 10 Scotches in him.

47:53.957 --> 47:55.250
What am I going to do?

47:56.042 --> 47:59.546
Please, I mean the chances of
anything risqué happening

47:59.629 --> 48:02.298
- is so fucking remote.

48:02.757 --> 48:03.800
Good night, Danny.

48:03.883 --> 48:05.510
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.

48:05.802 --> 48:08.805
You know, that song, it's beautiful.

48:08.888 --> 48:10.765
It's just a little short.

48:11.182 --> 48:13.476
But other than that, it's beautiful.

48:13.560 --> 48:14.561
Thank you.

48:14.644 --> 48:17.522
And you know,
what we were talking about before,

48:18.398 --> 48:19.566
you shouldn't give up.

48:19.816 --> 48:21.192
- I agree.
- Yeah.

48:21.276 --> 48:22.485
Dinner tomorrow?

48:22.569 --> 48:23.570
Not that.

48:24.029 --> 48:25.113
Your son.

48:26.114 --> 48:27.657
Oh, yeah. I know.

48:27.866 --> 48:30.326
Okay. But don't give up on dinner either.

48:30.660 --> 48:32.328
Oh, dinner, uh, tonight?

48:35.457 --> 48:37.208
She'll have dinner with me.

48:37.417 --> 48:39.252
That's right. A six-year-old girl.

48:39.336 --> 48:40.712
Well, you know, money's no issue. So...

48:40.795 --> 48:43.965
I'm running my operation
out of the business center.

48:44.424 --> 48:46.343
He said he was sending it to me.

48:46.718 --> 48:48.261
Well, I haven't gotten it yet.

48:48.386 --> 48:50.305
Yeah, it's for my granddaughter.

48:50.680 --> 48:52.432
What's he doing?

48:52.682 --> 48:55.685
He's bitch slappin'
the business center is what he's...

48:55.769 --> 48:58.355
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:58.438 --> 48:59.731
Hey.

49:18.792 --> 49:20.210
Hey, Ray!

49:20.752 --> 49:22.087
Steve, Mr. Collins.

49:22.962 --> 49:24.714
You'll always be Ray to me.

49:24.839 --> 49:26.216
- Ha!
- Fine.

49:32.597 --> 49:33.723
Oh, fuck me.

49:33.807 --> 49:34.808
Language, dear.

49:35.225 --> 49:37.102
We don't want your music!

49:38.103 --> 49:39.729
You don't want my music?

49:39.771 --> 49:42.482
Tom explained to Hope
how you're a musician

49:42.565 --> 49:44.401
and sometimes musicians travel door to door

49:44.901 --> 49:46.236
to sell their music.

49:46.277 --> 49:48.446
- Just like Girl Scouts sell their cookies.
- Yeah.

49:48.571 --> 49:49.948
And sometimes
you don't want Girl Scout cookies,

49:50.073 --> 49:51.241
so we're not being rude 'cause...

49:51.282 --> 49:52.784
Yeah, we're not rude.

49:52.909 --> 49:54.494
Just don't want any.

49:54.661 --> 49:55.745
- I get it.
- Okay.

49:55.787 --> 49:59.624
Possibly more complicated an explanation
than is required for a seven-year-old.

49:59.749 --> 50:02.168
- Possibly.
- You know what, I get it.

50:02.252 --> 50:04.587
Mommy, do you see this?

50:04.629 --> 50:06.381
- Hey, Jimmy!
- Hope.

50:06.423 --> 50:08.258
- Sorry. Hope.
- No, no, it's okay.

50:08.299 --> 50:10.539
- No, no. He's got her. He's got her.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

50:11.261 --> 50:13.346
So, are you just out running some errands?

50:13.430 --> 50:15.974
Yeah, you know.
I was in the neighborhood. So, you know.

50:16.057 --> 50:17.517
Are you fucking kidding me?

50:17.600 --> 50:19.269
Look at this, there's three of us.

50:19.310 --> 50:20.478
You got to be fucking kidding me.

50:20.603 --> 50:23.440
Have you heard of the
New Compass School in Manhattan?

50:23.523 --> 50:24.649
What?

50:24.774 --> 50:28.528
It's the most
progressive private school in the country.

50:28.945 --> 50:33.783
It's got a multi-modal approach

50:33.867 --> 50:37.787
towards treating children
with learning issues, particularly ADHD.

50:38.621 --> 50:40.165
I pulled some strings,

50:40.290 --> 50:43.168
and you have an interview in two hours.

50:43.293 --> 50:46.796
- It has a shower!
- I know.

50:46.838 --> 50:48.465
You can go in there, it doesn't work.

50:48.506 --> 50:51.426
Wait a second, do you really think we
haven't looked into every school there is?

50:51.468 --> 50:53.136
- Not this one.
- How do you know that?

50:53.636 --> 50:55.305
Well, you know, you can't afford it.

50:57.182 --> 50:58.975
Steven, would you mind
your own fucking business, please!

50:59.059 --> 51:00.060
I'm sorry, excuse me.

51:00.143 --> 51:02.395
You mean that we have an interview,
as our family, today,

51:02.479 --> 51:04.356
in two hours at the New Compass School?

51:04.481 --> 51:07.317
People wait two years
for such an interview.

51:07.359 --> 51:09.319
Two years. You have it in two hours.

51:09.986 --> 51:12.864
Just give me a day
to do something good for you.

51:13.365 --> 51:15.992
And then, you know, I'm gone, forever.

51:16.493 --> 51:19.746
And you still go to heaven
because you're so damn tolerant.

51:19.829 --> 51:24.167
And I will still go to hell because, you know,
you can't buy redemption.

51:24.668 --> 51:26.169
Everybody wins.

51:26.503 --> 51:28.088
Let's do this thing. Come on.

51:28.672 --> 51:30.715
Bring your friends, you have friends?

51:31.216 --> 51:32.384
We got room.

51:34.511 --> 51:35.679
Hey!

51:35.720 --> 51:38.181
This school, it's not like
there's a two-year wait.

51:38.223 --> 51:40.642
It's like there's a six-year wait.

51:40.684 --> 51:42.018
What are you saying?

51:42.102 --> 51:46.272
I'm saying I'm gonna get Hope and you
put on a shirt with some fucking buttons.

51:46.356 --> 51:49.484
Hey, Hope. Come here, baby.

51:54.781 --> 51:57.575
Everything is back there!

51:57.701 --> 52:00.203
I love it! It's so cool!

52:00.328 --> 52:02.205
And I love everything in it!

52:02.247 --> 52:03.873
It looks like it could be a house.

52:03.998 --> 52:06.001
And maybe he lives in here!

52:06.042 --> 52:07.585
And I'm sure he really does.

52:07.711 --> 52:11.297
But it's still cool,
and I can't even stop talking!

52:12.549 --> 52:15.468
<i>I wrote him, and then
I talked to him on the phone.</i>

52:15.552 --> 52:17.470
So, do you know Dr. Kurtz?

52:17.554 --> 52:20.140
Sometimes he does
a talk-back thing on his blog.

52:20.223 --> 52:21.224
On his what?

52:21.307 --> 52:23.059
His blog. He writes a blog.

52:23.685 --> 52:24.686
What's a block?

52:24.728 --> 52:25.729
A blog. It's a...

52:25.854 --> 52:26.855
A blog.

52:26.896 --> 52:28.231
I can't believe I'm going to meet him.

52:28.314 --> 52:30.400
Everything is on this bus!

52:39.659 --> 52:42.245
This is a school?

52:42.328 --> 52:44.956
- The blog doesn't do it justice.
- I know.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.750
Sorry to keep you waiting. Sorry.

52:47.375 --> 52:48.835
I'm dressed like Jack LaLanne,

52:48.918 --> 52:50.587
I'm elastic-only on the weekends.

52:50.670 --> 52:51.755
I'm Dr. Kurtz.

52:51.880 --> 52:54.090
Shock-ma-a-lya!

52:54.507 --> 52:56.176
You really are Danny Collins!

52:56.259 --> 52:57.427
- Yes, I am.
- Wow!

52:57.510 --> 52:58.762
You're really Dr. Kurtz.

52:58.887 --> 52:59.888
You really are.

52:59.929 --> 53:00.930
- Tom Donnelly.
- Danny Collins.

53:01.014 --> 53:03.516
- My wife, Samantha. My daughter, Hope.
- It's so good to meet you.

53:03.600 --> 53:05.769
And my balls are in her purse.
In case you want to meet them later.

53:05.810 --> 53:07.437
You're a lot different
than talking on the phone.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.356
Well, I hope so.

53:09.939 --> 53:11.816
You must be Hope.

53:12.776 --> 53:16.237
- I'm Tom.
- Tom. Then you must be Hope.

53:16.279 --> 53:18.948
Hi, Samantha Donnelly.
I follow you on Twitter.

53:19.032 --> 53:20.950
- Well, thank you.
- She reads your blog.

53:21.701 --> 53:23.244
Then who's Hope?

53:23.286 --> 53:27.540
I'm Hope! Over here! That's me!
I'm seven! I'm Hope!

53:27.624 --> 53:30.627
How are you?
Let me show you around.

53:31.461 --> 53:32.962
Come on you, you started all this.

53:33.088 --> 53:34.464
Oh, I did.

53:35.423 --> 53:37.759
Mom, Dad, you're not going to believe it!

53:37.801 --> 53:39.386
Hope! Hope!

53:39.469 --> 53:42.430
She's okay. She'll be all right.
She's fine.

53:42.472 --> 53:46.101
It was in the first grade when we started
to notice that she was having some trouble.

53:46.142 --> 53:47.936
Yeah, we got a tutor for her once a week,

53:47.977 --> 53:50.814
and I do these exercises with her,
every night really.

53:50.897 --> 53:51.898
But she's got trouble with focus.

53:51.981 --> 53:53.316
It's been a real struggle for us.

53:53.775 --> 53:54.901
Really.

53:54.984 --> 53:56.569
Yeah. Yeah.

53:57.153 --> 54:00.824
Most schools try to train children
like Hope to fit into their systems.

54:00.949 --> 54:02.949
We prefer to tailor a program
to the child's needs.

54:02.992 --> 54:04.911
It's like one big IEP here.

54:04.994 --> 54:07.872
Individualized Educational Program?

54:07.956 --> 54:09.249
IEP.

54:10.125 --> 54:11.167
You've been doing your homework,
Mr. Collins.

54:11.292 --> 54:12.544
Got it right here.

54:14.004 --> 54:16.089
Come on, let me show you the rest.

54:16.172 --> 54:18.052
Do you remember
who did the original assessment?

54:18.425 --> 54:19.801
You having fun?

54:19.843 --> 54:22.303
A little, yeah. I'm very excited.

54:23.513 --> 54:25.765
We're only half speed
during our summer programs.

54:25.849 --> 54:27.569
But you can still get a sense of the place.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.519
Oh, yeah, I got a sense of it already.

54:29.602 --> 54:30.603
How about that, huh?

54:30.687 --> 54:34.482
So, is this just K through 5
or all the way K through 8?

54:34.524 --> 54:36.484
No, elementary and middle.

54:36.526 --> 54:37.819
We'd carry her through the 8th grade

54:37.861 --> 54:39.195
and then we'd place her
in one of our accredited...

54:39.279 --> 54:42.323
No, no, no. We live in New Jersey.
We can't come all the way in...

54:42.407 --> 54:44.200
No, she'll have a driver.

54:44.242 --> 54:45.452
Every day.

54:45.577 --> 54:48.246
To and from school.
Every day, through college.

54:50.582 --> 54:53.376
Put that in writing. Guaranteed.

54:54.210 --> 54:56.588
A more formal interview
is required, obviously.

54:56.671 --> 54:59.341
But considering
Mr. Collins' generous donation

54:59.424 --> 55:02.927
and what I see in Hope's records,
I suspect the interview will go well.

55:03.845 --> 55:06.848
You have a lot to discuss,
but trust me, you want this.

55:07.098 --> 55:08.778
This can change the course of Hope's life.

55:09.184 --> 55:11.227
- I'll give you guys a minute.
- Thank you, Doc.

55:11.561 --> 55:12.729
You're a good grandpa.

55:13.396 --> 55:14.397
Thank you, man.

55:14.481 --> 55:17.275
- Thank you so much for... Thank you.
- Yeah.

55:18.943 --> 55:23.281
So, now that the educational
portion of the day is over,

55:23.406 --> 55:25.950
uh, let's get to the fun stuff.

55:26.451 --> 55:29.329
What fun stuff? Like...
No, we're just gonna go back home. Right?

55:29.412 --> 55:30.997
No, you said a day. Remember?

55:31.081 --> 55:32.123
No, I didn't.

55:32.207 --> 55:33.291
- We agreed to it, Samantha.
- Yes, he did!

55:33.375 --> 55:34.417
Yes, he did.

55:34.501 --> 55:36.127
I don't think "agreed" is the word.

55:36.211 --> 55:38.463
- I didn't agree to a day.
- Samantha. For God's sake.

55:38.797 --> 55:39.798
Okay.

55:39.881 --> 55:41.174
Samantha, you were there.

55:41.257 --> 55:42.967
Okay. We agreed. We agreed to a day.

55:43.051 --> 55:45.387
And when I check it,

55:47.097 --> 55:48.431
day ain't over yet.

55:49.641 --> 55:52.310
It's not over, Dad!

55:52.936 --> 55:53.978
Everything he says upsets me.

55:54.062 --> 55:56.742
- Every single thing he says upsets me.
- Let him have this one day.

56:28.972 --> 56:30.223
Stay here, I got her.

56:30.974 --> 56:32.225
Kiss?

56:38.606 --> 56:44.195
I wanna say something,
but I'm afraid I'm going to be too nice.

56:45.697 --> 56:47.198
Good night, Samantha.

56:48.074 --> 56:52.954
Thank you. Thank you.

56:58.168 --> 57:01.004
Jimmy, you wanna help her, please?

57:01.087 --> 57:02.672
Watch your head, honey.

57:03.757 --> 57:06.301
Thank you so much, Jimmy.
Thank you, guys.

57:06.593 --> 57:10.555
Jimmy, give us a minute. Thanks.

57:28.782 --> 57:30.742
You are a ridiculous man.

57:33.286 --> 57:35.705
You know, I've spent my entire life

57:37.040 --> 57:39.834
trying to become the man that you aren't.

57:41.086 --> 57:42.754
I am exhausted.

57:44.130 --> 57:47.133
You have no idea
how exhausting that has been.

57:50.220 --> 57:52.722
You know, when I met your mom,

57:54.140 --> 57:55.975
I was so strung out

57:56.768 --> 57:58.728
on God knows what.

57:58.812 --> 58:00.021
And when I found out,

58:00.480 --> 58:01.856
you know...

58:03.024 --> 58:04.651
I, uh, tried to help.

58:05.402 --> 58:06.653
Send money.

58:07.779 --> 58:11.032
She wouldn't have any of it. Refused it.

58:12.367 --> 58:14.369
But, you know, my life was so extreme.

58:14.452 --> 58:18.081
It was so full of drugs and women...

58:18.456 --> 58:23.336
Traveling. All that rock star shit.

58:24.546 --> 58:26.464
I always thought, whoever you were,

58:26.548 --> 58:30.885
that you'd be better off
with a more normal life.

58:30.969 --> 58:34.014
More normal people.

58:34.097 --> 58:36.307
I don't know

58:36.391 --> 58:41.354
how I allowed it to go on this long.

58:48.111 --> 58:53.283
What you did today,
your slate's clean with me.

58:54.993 --> 58:57.620
But that's as far as this goes, okay?

58:59.372 --> 59:02.417
- I want to be a part of your life.
- It's not a good time right now.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.836
This is not the right time, okay?

59:06.171 --> 59:08.531
- Why is this not the right time?
- It's not the right time.

59:16.556 --> 59:17.682
What's the matter?

59:17.766 --> 59:19.100
I'm sick.

59:22.854 --> 59:23.855
Shit.

59:25.982 --> 59:29.235
You're sick? What do you mean?

59:29.319 --> 59:31.613
It's what Mom died...

59:33.531 --> 59:35.784
It's in the blood.

59:35.867 --> 59:37.327
It's pretty bad.

59:41.498 --> 59:42.957
Fuck.

59:44.959 --> 59:46.670
Fuck, you're kidding me?

59:47.837 --> 59:50.340
I just met you.

59:50.382 --> 59:52.133
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

59:53.426 --> 59:54.928
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

59:55.220 --> 59:59.683
Obviously, that wasn't a great thing,
a great reaction. I'm sorry.

59:59.766 --> 01:00:00.892
No, that's okay.

01:00:00.975 --> 01:00:02.769
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, man. Look...

01:00:02.852 --> 01:00:06.231
Look, I'm the one that should be sorry.
I mean, after all, you're...

01:00:06.314 --> 01:00:08.775
You're Danny Collins, right? I mean, uh...

01:00:08.858 --> 01:00:12.028
Who the fuck am I
to get in the way of your happy ending?

01:00:12.112 --> 01:00:13.279
...Tom, Tom, Tom...

01:00:13.363 --> 01:00:16.574
Let me ask you something.
How did you think this was going to end,

01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:18.493
that little movie
you've got going on in your head?

01:00:18.535 --> 01:00:21.788
What, you thought you'd just show up
out of the blue, out of nowhere, really,

01:00:21.871 --> 01:00:23.957
and fix my little girl,

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.585
and then, what, you and me hold hands
and cry as the music swells, is that it?

01:00:27.669 --> 01:00:28.878
- Don't you fucking touch me.
- If I meant that...

01:00:28.962 --> 01:00:30.005
Don't fucking touch me!

01:00:31.047 --> 01:00:33.299
Look, you want a little bit
of the real world, huh?

01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:35.051
You wanna do, like, normal?

01:00:35.093 --> 01:00:37.679
How's this for normal, superstar?

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:40.181
I got a $200,000 mortgage.

01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:41.808
I got a pregnant wife.

01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:45.603
And, oh, yeah, I got this rare form of
leukemia that's probably going to kill me.

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:47.897
Welcome home, Dad. See what you missed?

01:00:48.898 --> 01:00:50.400
I don't know what to say.

01:00:50.483 --> 01:00:53.820
I don't need you to say anything, man.
I just need you to leave.

01:00:53.903 --> 01:00:55.905
Let me go back inside and talk to my wife

01:00:55.947 --> 01:00:57.574
before she asks me
what the hell we're talking about.

01:00:57.657 --> 01:00:58.950
Wait, hold it!

01:01:00.493 --> 01:01:02.245
She doesn't know?

01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:05.040
Are you crazy?

01:01:08.626 --> 01:01:10.587
That's no good, man.

01:01:10.628 --> 01:01:13.256
Look, I got a great doctor in New York.

01:01:14.924 --> 01:01:19.971
He's talking about three weeks
of this target therapy shit.

01:01:20.055 --> 01:01:21.973
I'm not going to lose my hair.

01:01:22.057 --> 01:01:25.852
Within a month, they know if it's taken.
If it's taken, then maybe I stand a chance.

01:01:25.935 --> 01:01:29.314
And if it doesn't, then it happens quick.

01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:34.611
Sam is six months into a rough pregnancy.

01:01:34.694 --> 01:01:37.280
So I'll tell her after the baby.

01:01:38.323 --> 01:01:43.119
I'm going to Delaware on a job.
That's what she knows.

01:01:43.411 --> 01:01:46.414
I mean, you're going to need help.
You have a friend?

01:01:46.873 --> 01:01:48.500
She's my friend.

01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:54.881
Then, uh... Whatever. I'll be there.

01:01:56.466 --> 01:01:58.468
I mean, what else is there?

01:01:58.551 --> 01:02:00.303
Be where?

01:02:00.345 --> 01:02:01.930
Wherever.

01:02:02.013 --> 01:02:04.516
I mean, you need me, I'll be...

01:02:04.599 --> 01:02:07.268
- No, no, no, I don't need you.
- You do...

01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.687
That's not what this is about.

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:13.191
This is not open for discussion.
This is not open for discussion.

01:02:13.274 --> 01:02:15.902
You're going to have to deal with it.

01:02:15.985 --> 01:02:20.073
Because I'm here to fucking stay.

01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:53.523
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:02:53.565 --> 01:02:55.734
So, how'd it go?

01:02:55.817 --> 01:02:59.612
Well, yeah. You know, it was just...

01:03:00.697 --> 01:03:01.948
You know, yeah.

01:03:02.323 --> 01:03:04.909
No, I get it. I get it.
Family can be messy.

01:03:05.035 --> 01:03:06.286
Right?

01:03:06.369 --> 01:03:09.789
Yeah, that is true.
That is definitely true.

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:11.833
In this case, yes.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:14.836
Exactly, I mean, you're meeting
your grown son for the first time.

01:03:14.919 --> 01:03:17.756
You didn't expect it to be easy, right?

01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:20.717
I thought it'd be
fucking easier than this.

01:03:21.217 --> 01:03:23.595
Right. Yeah.

01:03:25.555 --> 01:03:27.974
You know, every part of me right now

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:31.644
would like to just go in there
and get soused with you.

01:03:32.604 --> 01:03:33.605
But...

01:03:34.689 --> 01:03:36.649
I'm going to go upstairs instead.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.651
That's good, right?

01:03:38.735 --> 01:03:42.030
Yeah, no. There's a piano up there
with your name on it.

01:03:42.447 --> 01:03:43.990
Only if my name is Steinway.

01:03:46.659 --> 01:03:48.161
So we got our patter back.

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:53.416
You're cool.

01:03:55.502 --> 01:03:57.170
I am not cool.

01:03:57.295 --> 01:03:58.880
Yes, you are.

01:03:58.963 --> 01:04:00.423
I am not cool.

01:04:02.717 --> 01:04:07.806
<i>It's spring in my mind</i>

01:04:09.849 --> 01:04:14.229
<i>But the autumn leaves they fall</i>

01:04:17.315 --> 01:04:21.569
<i>As I am walking by</i>

01:04:22.779 --> 01:04:25.281
<i>I collect them all</i>

01:04:25.323 --> 01:04:27.617
Now I have had success
with this in the past.

01:04:27.701 --> 01:04:29.411
But I'm not going to lie to you,
Mr. Donnelly.

01:04:29.452 --> 01:04:32.205
The next several weeks
aren't going to be pretty.

01:04:32.622 --> 01:04:36.292
Most people are a little alarmed
at how awful it can feel.

01:04:36.793 --> 01:04:38.461
And that will get worse.

01:04:43.633 --> 01:04:44.968
This okay?

01:04:54.352 --> 01:04:56.896
Who is Jackie Joyner-Kersee?

01:05:05.905 --> 01:05:07.741
<i>You don't like chicken noodle soup?</i>

01:05:07.866 --> 01:05:09.826
How the fuck do you not like
chicken noodle soup?

01:05:09.868 --> 01:05:12.537
I don't like noodles, okay?

01:05:12.662 --> 01:05:14.831
Makes me think of worms.

01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:23.048
Surprise.

01:05:25.675 --> 01:05:28.178
<i>My uncle took me fishing one time.
He took the worm,</i>

01:05:28.219 --> 01:05:30.722
put it in his mouth and he ate it
just to fuck with me, okay?

01:05:30.847 --> 01:05:32.515
And now, whenever I see a noodle,

01:05:32.557 --> 01:05:36.519
I think of my fat slob of an uncle
eating a worm and it freaks me out.

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:43.485
- Well, look at this.
- This technique...

01:05:43.526 --> 01:05:47.238
- You made the picture.
- I made the picture. Yeah.

01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:49.783
Don't get cocky.

01:05:49.908 --> 01:05:51.993
What kind of uncle screws up a little kid,

01:05:52.077 --> 01:05:54.079
makes him phobic
about chicken noodle soup?

01:05:54.162 --> 01:05:56.539
- That I don't get.
- Get out!

01:06:04.255 --> 01:06:06.383
A, B minor, C sharp.

01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:07.884
I don't know what that means.

01:06:07.967 --> 01:06:10.011
No, no. Listen, let me teach you.

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:13.682
Let me teach you, petulant little fucker.

01:06:16.976 --> 01:06:20.939
Okay, so three weeks from today
we'll go over the test results together,

01:06:21.022 --> 01:06:23.817
and that'll dictate
what our next steps should be.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.487
But for now, let's just hope for the best.
Stay positive, all right?

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:28.697
Yeah, thank you.

01:06:28.738 --> 01:06:30.281
- Thanks, Doc.
- Thank you.

01:06:34.786 --> 01:06:38.415
<i>And I'm walking blind upon this road</i>

01:06:38.498 --> 01:06:41.584
<i>In search of higher ground</i>

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:48.591
<i>I'm walking blind upon this road
in search of higher ground</i>

01:06:49.843 --> 01:06:56.349
<i>Walking blind upon this road
in search of higher ground</i>

01:06:57.267 --> 01:07:00.979
<i>Don't look back</i>

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.818
<i>Don't look back</i>

01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:16.119
<i>Don't look back</i>

01:07:18.204 --> 01:07:20.790
<i>And don't look down</i>

01:07:36.973 --> 01:07:40.810
Come in! It's unbolty thinged.

01:07:42.354 --> 01:07:44.230
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:46.566
Yeah, so, I got your note.

01:07:46.649 --> 01:07:49.486
Yeah, so, what do you think?

01:07:50.987 --> 01:07:54.157
Well, okay, okay.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.160
"Pictures from my life
as I'm walking down the hall.

01:07:57.994 --> 01:08:00.413
"As I'm walking by, I collect them all."

01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:03.083
- What do you think?
- Well...

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:07.253
You're aware that I have no basis
in musical knowledge or theory.

01:08:07.337 --> 01:08:09.005
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:08:09.047 --> 01:08:11.007
- So, you still want my opinion?
- Of course.

01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:16.179
Well, I think I kind of liked it better
the way it was, with the leaves.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.014
Really?

01:08:18.055 --> 01:08:20.350
Yeah, the leaves and... Yeah.

01:08:21.225 --> 01:08:22.227
Me, too.

01:08:26.022 --> 01:08:28.191
I just wanted to get you back
in my room again.

01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:31.861
So now I can ask you
out to dinner, right?

01:08:31.986 --> 01:08:33.363
Play this in a concert, okay?

01:08:33.404 --> 01:08:34.738
Then you can take me to dinner.

01:08:35.073 --> 01:08:36.408
You're a dinner tease.

01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:37.826
I am not a dinner tease.

01:08:37.867 --> 01:08:41.537
You're a huge dinner tease.
I found you out.

01:08:41.662 --> 01:08:43.415
Oh, you're terrible.

01:08:46.001 --> 01:08:50.005
This is my second time
in New Jersey in two months.

01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:52.381
I am not happy about that.

01:08:52.506 --> 01:08:56.845
Frank. Gee, I owed you a call.

01:08:56.886 --> 01:08:59.221
Oh, Frank. I'm so sorry.

01:08:59.264 --> 01:09:01.140
But you know what
it's like when I'm workin'.

01:09:02.725 --> 01:09:04.560
- I've been so busy...
- Yeah, apparently.

01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:07.063
May I...

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:11.818
Oh, yeah, sure. This is Frank Grubman.

01:09:11.901 --> 01:09:14.404
My manager and my best friend.

01:09:14.446 --> 01:09:15.697
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

01:09:15.738 --> 01:09:18.198
This is Mary. She's my new girlfriend.

01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:19.325
Oh, really?

01:09:19.408 --> 01:09:21.286
Well, I'm working on it.
You know, I mean...

01:09:21.703 --> 01:09:24.956
- She's a big dinner tease.
- I'm not. I am not.

01:09:25.081 --> 01:09:28.585
Yes, yes, yes.
She keeps moving the goal post. No?

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:33.298
Mary, would you mind
if I had a word with Danny in private?

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:34.758
Oh, no, of course. Of course.

01:09:34.883 --> 01:09:37.469
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:09:37.594 --> 01:09:39.595
Yeah, I think you've said enough.

01:09:40.388 --> 01:09:42.390
Okay, dinner tonight.

01:09:42.432 --> 01:09:44.225
Yeah, you're ridiculous.

01:09:46.102 --> 01:09:47.103
She's lovely.

01:09:47.145 --> 01:09:48.229
And age appropriate.

01:09:48.645 --> 01:09:49.689
No, not really.

01:09:49.814 --> 01:09:50.814
Baby steps.

01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:54.486
Yeah. All right, sit, sit, sit.
We need to talk.

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:56.654
I know.
There's a lot I want to tell you, pal.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:59.449
Unfortunately,
I have my manager hat on right now.

01:10:02.452 --> 01:10:05.955
Okay. What's up?

01:10:05.997 --> 01:10:09.084
I've been going over things with Bill

01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:12.128
and you're not exactly
where you think you are.

01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:16.466
Okay. Where am I?

01:10:16.549 --> 01:10:20.095
A little ahead when we sell properties.
But only a little.

01:10:20.136 --> 01:10:23.765
I mean, we shouldn't have sold
your publishing rights so early.

01:10:23.807 --> 01:10:27.143
All those properties,
the housing market has collapsed.

01:10:27.185 --> 01:10:30.021
The private plane, your lifestyle.

01:10:30.105 --> 01:10:33.316
The Madoff thing,
that absolutely killed you, as you know.

01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:37.320
But, uh, you're not bankrupt or anything.

01:10:37.987 --> 01:10:42.283
It's just that you need to understand
how serious it is.

01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:46.162
Okay. So what do I do?

01:10:46.287 --> 01:10:47.789
One of two things.

01:10:47.997 --> 01:10:50.667
You start living like a normal human.

01:10:50.792 --> 01:10:54.170
You buy a Prius, you fly Continental,
you know, that kind of shit.

01:10:54.254 --> 01:10:56.089
Or you go back on tour.

01:10:57.132 --> 01:11:00.677
And this last tour
was my retirement plan for you.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.280
- I mean, we had a big piece.
- I know.

01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:03.680
- Concessions!
- I know.

01:11:03.805 --> 01:11:05.515
- Merchandise!
- I know.

01:11:06.474 --> 01:11:08.184
I'm writing, Frank.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.729
- Oh, Danny.
- I'm telling you, it's good.

01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:13.356
Mary thinks it's really good.

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:18.820
Oh, the Woodcliff Lake Hotel manager?
Oh, oh, okay. Well, now I feel much better.

01:11:18.862 --> 01:11:20.697
Just get me a gig.

01:11:20.822 --> 01:11:22.407
- A gig?
- A gig, yeah.

01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:24.826
Something small, not a big arena.

01:11:24.868 --> 01:11:27.662
Just, you know, something
like Springsteen would go do.

01:11:28.121 --> 01:11:30.498
"Like Springsteen would do."

01:11:30.623 --> 01:11:32.500
Yeah, he just pops into these places...

01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:35.545
Danny, Danny, Danny...

01:11:35.628 --> 01:11:37.130
Do you even hear yourself?

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:39.382
This stuff is good.

01:11:39.799 --> 01:11:41.343
Just give it a chance.

01:11:41.718 --> 01:11:44.554
And then, we'll tour.

01:11:46.181 --> 01:11:48.850
And the bonus is that, uh,

01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:52.729
I won't think about killing
myself every night.

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:57.567
Okay?

01:11:59.235 --> 01:12:00.695
Okay.

01:12:02.155 --> 01:12:04.240
Okay,
I'm going to make an announcement.

01:12:04.324 --> 01:12:05.367
- All right.
- All right.

01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:07.285
- Are you ready?
- Yup.

01:12:07.452 --> 01:12:09.037
Uh...

01:12:09.079 --> 01:12:11.247
I'll be playing a gig in a bar.

01:12:11.289 --> 01:12:12.290
Oh, a gig?

01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:14.834
- On Friday night.
- A gig?

01:12:14.918 --> 01:12:16.294
What's a gig?

01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:19.255
A gig. A gig is where
I sing in front of people.

01:12:19.589 --> 01:12:20.840
I wanna hear you sing.

01:12:20.924 --> 01:12:22.164
And I want you to hear me sing.

01:12:22.258 --> 01:12:25.428
I want you to hear me sing
more than anything in the world.

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:30.266
But we have to check it out
with Mom and Pop and see if it's okay.

01:12:30.308 --> 01:12:31.393
It's at a bar, huh?

01:12:31.434 --> 01:12:32.977
I'm going to go to a gig at a bar.

01:12:33.645 --> 01:12:35.689
Oh, it's an upscale bar.
You know, it's got...

01:12:35.772 --> 01:12:37.148
What's an upscale bar?

01:12:37.273 --> 01:12:39.984
Fully appropriate cocktail menu.
Cover charge...

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:41.861
- Cover charge! Really?
- Yes, that's right.

01:12:41.945 --> 01:12:44.114
You're doing things with cover charges now?

01:12:44.364 --> 01:12:47.283
This place big enough for you
to be able to do your moves?

01:12:49.202 --> 01:12:50.704
Man, nothing holds my moves back.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:53.248
That's what we wanna see.
That's what we're looking for.

01:12:53.289 --> 01:12:54.791
Yeah.

01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:57.544
Another Danny Collins?
I think it's called "the Danny Collins."

01:12:57.627 --> 01:13:01.464
<i>Hey, baby doll
What's goin' on?</i>

01:13:01.965 --> 01:13:03.299
I don't want that to start.

01:13:03.717 --> 01:13:06.302
So what do you think? Show starts 7:30.

01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:08.972
- Done by 9:00.
- 9:00?

01:13:09.055 --> 01:13:10.223
- Yeah, it's late.
- That's late.

01:13:10.306 --> 01:13:11.558
- But not too late.
- I don't know.

01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:14.161
You sure your crowd's going to be able
to stay awake until 9:00?

01:13:14.227 --> 01:13:15.812
They going to be conscious?

01:13:15.895 --> 01:13:17.480
We're going to have to call the club

01:13:17.564 --> 01:13:20.316
and let them know that there might be
a whole room full of snoring old ladies.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.444
That's good, I'm gonna give them a call
and give them a heads up,

01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:23.486
make sure they know.

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:25.155
Oh, you're so kind.

01:13:25.864 --> 01:13:28.366
So what are we going to do?
We going to get your permission?

01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:31.327
Are we going to get Mommy and Daddy
to say, "Yes, it's okay"?

01:13:31.369 --> 01:13:33.079
Because it's a big thing for me.

01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:36.207
And it would help if
I had these cheeks there.

01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:38.168
These cheeks will be there.

01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:43.340
There you go. From the cheeksy-mouth.

01:13:44.507 --> 01:13:47.844
Babe? Do you hear this?
It's been going on...

01:13:47.927 --> 01:13:49.888
When are you going to get yourself
to the doctor already?

01:13:49.971 --> 01:13:51.639
- It's just a little bug.
- It's not a little bug.

01:13:51.681 --> 01:13:54.184
It's been happening for weeks,
at least since you got back.

01:13:54.267 --> 01:13:57.604
Hope, is your Daddy
the most stubborn man on the planet?

01:13:57.687 --> 01:14:00.190
Don't be so stubborn, Daddy!

01:14:00.231 --> 01:14:01.274
I'm fine, baby.

01:14:01.358 --> 01:14:02.776
Yeah, don't be so stubborn, Daddy!

01:14:02.859 --> 01:14:05.899
He'd rather walk around like the living
dead instead of just get antibiotics.

01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:07.364
Listen to Mama!

01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:09.847
- Gotta listen to Mama. That's a good idea.
- Listen to Mama.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.534
Stubborn man.

01:14:12.869 --> 01:14:14.537
Stubborn man.

01:14:21.378 --> 01:14:24.964
<i>Hey, baby doll
What's goin' on?</i>

01:14:29.594 --> 01:14:32.097
Yes, all the way. Yes!

01:15:06.923 --> 01:15:10.135
Jesus. You look like Lee Trevino.

01:15:12.679 --> 01:15:14.889
- Samantha took me shopping.
- Oh.

01:15:14.973 --> 01:15:17.642
You ever hear of this place,
the Banana Republic?

01:15:17.726 --> 01:15:19.644
- Yeah, I think so.
- It's an amazing place.

01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:23.940
Yeah, okay. The house is packed.

01:15:24.024 --> 01:15:25.233
Oh, that's good.

01:15:25.316 --> 01:15:26.735
Band's out there, ready.

01:15:26.818 --> 01:15:30.864
Phil can step in on piano
if you need him for the new stuff.

01:15:30.947 --> 01:15:32.741
Family's up front.

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:38.163
And I saved a spot for Mary.
She's with them.

01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:39.664
Speak of the devil.

01:15:40.373 --> 01:15:41.916
Break a leg, kid.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.251
Just tell me whose.

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.130
Go on in. He'll be thrilled to see you.

01:15:47.172 --> 01:15:48.673
- Well, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:15:48.757 --> 01:15:51.134
Okay, bye, see you later out there.

01:15:51.217 --> 01:15:56.973
Oh, my God, thank you for the VIP ticket.
I am right in the front row.

01:15:57.057 --> 01:16:01.603
I thought I'd come back and see
how you're doing, you know. You nervous?

01:16:01.686 --> 01:16:04.689
Mary, you know,
I've done this a zillion times.

01:16:04.773 --> 01:16:08.151
I'm never nervous. Hand to God, not once.

01:16:08.276 --> 01:16:09.444
Not once?

01:16:11.196 --> 01:16:12.989
But I'm nervous now.

01:16:13.156 --> 01:16:15.533
- No, that's nice.
- So this...

01:16:16.993 --> 01:16:21.164
I mean, I guess this means
that finally you'll let me buy you dinner?

01:16:21.831 --> 01:16:23.333
Let's see how you do first.

01:16:24.959 --> 01:16:28.004
Give me a little more pressure.
Just what I need.

01:16:28.088 --> 01:16:30.423
You know, this is kind of weird to say,
I know,

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:35.053
because I really haven't know you very long.
But I am very proud of you, Danny.

01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:36.638
Wow...

01:16:36.763 --> 01:16:39.182
That is fucking weird, Mary.

01:16:39.265 --> 01:16:42.769
- You're sweet and weird. Just how I like 'em.
- There you go.

01:16:42.852 --> 01:16:47.023
Okay. Well, there you go. Have a great time.
You're going to be fantastic.

01:16:47.107 --> 01:16:49.859
Oh, thank you. I love you, Mary.

01:16:50.151 --> 01:16:52.862
Uh, that's a show-business expression,
you know.

01:16:52.946 --> 01:16:56.199
Kind of means I sort of like ya.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:59.369
You still there?

01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:07.127
You look really nice.

01:17:07.836 --> 01:17:09.754
You look really nice, too.

01:17:11.047 --> 01:17:12.549
Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:14.718
Oh, right.

01:17:43.913 --> 01:17:45.999
Hi, Grandpa!

01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:51.629
Grandpa!

01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:00.889
<i>Thank you. Thank you again.</i>

01:18:02.182 --> 01:18:03.308
<i>Thank you three times.</i>

01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:06.895
<i>My granddaughter, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:18:12.192 --> 01:18:13.943
<i>Okay.</i>

01:18:14.027 --> 01:18:16.529
<i>- Baby Doll!
- Baby Doll!</i>

01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:31.878
Come on, Danny, play <i>Baby Doll!</i>

01:18:31.961 --> 01:18:34.547
- Yeah, Baby Doll!
- Whoo!

01:18:34.631 --> 01:18:36.800
Play <i>Baby Doll,</i> Danny!

01:18:36.883 --> 01:18:37.884
Whoo!

01:18:38.677 --> 01:18:41.388
- Play <i>Baby Doll!
- Baby Doll!</i>

01:18:41.471 --> 01:18:42.597
<i>Baby Doll,</i> Danny!

01:18:42.681 --> 01:18:44.724
<i>Baby Doll!</i>

01:18:44.808 --> 01:18:47.143
- Play <i>Baby Doll,</i> Danny!
<i>- Baby Doll!</i>

01:18:47.227 --> 01:18:50.313
- Play <i>Baby Doll,</i> Danny!
- Play <i>Baby Doll!</i>

01:19:05.412 --> 01:19:06.538
Phil.

01:19:07.789 --> 01:19:09.541
Can you just...

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.295
<i>- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, Danny.</i>

01:19:14.379 --> 01:19:17.340
<i>Just working out a little something.</i>

01:19:17.674 --> 01:19:18.675
<i>Uh...</i>

01:19:18.925 --> 01:19:21.803
<i>But I know what you're here for.</i>

01:19:24.347 --> 01:19:25.682
<i>I think you know this one.</i>

01:19:29.644 --> 01:19:31.896
<i>Hey, baby doll</i>

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.481
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:20:32.707 --> 01:20:34.250
Danny!

01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:36.211
Sophie!

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.964
- Danny Collins.
- What are you doing here?

01:20:40.131 --> 01:20:43.051
Well, we heard about the gig and we're like,
"Let's go support our sugar daddy."

01:20:43.134 --> 01:20:44.302
Oh, yeah...

01:20:44.386 --> 01:20:47.681
And I used your credit card for the flight.
I hope that's okay.

01:20:47.764 --> 01:20:49.516
What's up? What do you got on you?

01:20:49.599 --> 01:20:50.600
What do you mean?

01:20:50.684 --> 01:20:52.227
Come on. Come on. What do I mean?

01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:53.436
Come on, babe, he wants to party.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.521
I wanna taste.

01:20:54.604 --> 01:20:58.149
- I got it all, baby. I got it all.
- Okay.

01:21:01.528 --> 01:21:02.570
Mmm.

01:21:02.612 --> 01:21:04.197
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

01:21:08.868 --> 01:21:10.787
Here you go, Danny.

01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:12.831
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

01:21:12.914 --> 01:21:14.499
It's good.

01:21:21.256 --> 01:21:23.508
I fired the pool guy and the gardener.

01:21:23.591 --> 01:21:26.219
I really didn't like the
way he looked at me.

01:21:26.302 --> 01:21:27.622
You know, I decided to start...

01:21:27.637 --> 01:21:29.014
...Grandpa!

01:21:29.389 --> 01:21:30.807
- Grandpa?
- Honey.

01:21:32.142 --> 01:21:34.728
<i>Hey, baby doll</i>

01:21:34.811 --> 01:21:37.105
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

01:21:37.188 --> 01:21:38.481
Come here. Come on.

01:21:38.565 --> 01:21:40.233
- Dad! What you doing?
- Go to Mommy. It's okay.

01:21:40.358 --> 01:21:41.985
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:21:42.068 --> 01:21:44.195
Wasn't doing anything. I didn't know, uh...

01:21:44.279 --> 01:21:46.531
I didn't know... Hi, Samantha. Hi.

01:21:47.198 --> 01:21:52.537
This is my friend Sophie there.
And her friend, Busywork.

01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:54.372
So what's goin' on?

01:21:55.415 --> 01:21:57.417
What's the look?

01:21:58.126 --> 01:21:59.127
Oh.

01:21:59.252 --> 01:22:00.962
You just keep judging me, Tom.

01:22:01.838 --> 01:22:02.839
You just judge me. Go ahead.

01:22:02.922 --> 01:22:05.842
You judge me all you want.
It's fine, that's what you're good at.

01:22:06.676 --> 01:22:08.970
And when you're done,

01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:11.181
you know, being so fucking perfect

01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:13.975
and honorable,

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:16.853
you should talk to your wife
about what you did in Delaware.

01:22:20.607 --> 01:22:24.652
What's that? What's he mean? Tom?

01:22:26.654 --> 01:22:28.531
I'll tell you when we get home.

01:22:35.663 --> 01:22:37.415
Stay the fuck away from my family.

01:22:37.499 --> 01:22:39.834
Tom. Let's go.

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:47.592
Bye, Hope.

01:22:56.976 --> 01:22:58.770
Oh, man.

01:23:31.386 --> 01:23:34.347
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:12.802
Who are you?

01:24:14.721 --> 01:24:17.307
Oh, I'm sorry, I work for the hotel.

01:24:17.349 --> 01:24:18.350
Oh, good. That's good.

01:24:19.309 --> 01:24:21.311
We need more towels. Can you do that?

01:24:21.394 --> 01:24:22.979
Mary!

01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:24.314
- And some beer.
- Oh, Mary.

01:24:24.397 --> 01:24:27.233
I'll get you some towels and some beer.

01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:36.534
Mary, wait, wait, wait.

01:24:36.659 --> 01:24:38.244
Mary, please.

01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:43.583
- It's not...
- What happened last night?

01:24:44.542 --> 01:24:46.169
Well, you know...

01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:50.340
I just... It wasn't right, you know?
It wasn't the right time.

01:24:50.382 --> 01:24:52.509
What are you talking about?

01:24:52.592 --> 01:24:55.512
You've worked so hard
and your whole family was there.

01:24:55.595 --> 01:24:56.596
- I know.
- Come on!

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.056
I just couldn't...

01:24:59.182 --> 01:25:00.266
I lost my nerve.

01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:02.519
Oh, well, you lost your dinner, too.

01:25:03.186 --> 01:25:04.437
Okay...

01:25:04.521 --> 01:25:06.690
You should have played the song, Danny.

01:25:06.773 --> 01:25:09.234
You should have at least played
the one fucking song.

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.705
Take care, Jamie.

01:25:22.789 --> 01:25:24.874
You, too, Mr. Collins.

01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:28.378
You be good to Nicky. He's a good boy.
You got a wonderful face.

01:25:29.713 --> 01:25:32.924
- Yours isn't so bad either, Mr. Collins.
- Oh.

01:25:33.049 --> 01:25:35.719
Look at that. Now we're getting patter.

01:25:40.557 --> 01:25:41.766
Okay.

01:25:45.061 --> 01:25:47.939
You know, for the record, uh,

01:25:49.065 --> 01:25:53.278
Mary Ann from <i>Gilligan's Island,</i>

01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:56.740
her real name was Dawn Wells.

01:25:56.823 --> 01:26:00.410
And she was Miss Nevada
before she got famous

01:26:00.493 --> 01:26:03.496
and she couldn't hold
a fucking candle to you.

01:26:13.131 --> 01:26:14.132
Bye.

01:26:20.889 --> 01:26:23.641
Nicky. Oh, Nicky.

01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.602
What a pleasure it's been.

01:26:25.685 --> 01:26:27.812
Pleasure's definitely been all mine, Danny.

01:26:27.896 --> 01:26:31.441
I'm gonna miss you. Gonna miss you.

01:26:32.567 --> 01:26:34.194
Look at this.

01:26:34.402 --> 01:26:35.695
Ran out of hundreds.

01:26:35.779 --> 01:26:37.989
Don't even worry about it. Come on.

01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:40.283
I'll tell you what.

01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:44.120
I'm in a giving vein today.

01:26:50.168 --> 01:26:51.961
Come on, get outta here.
What are you talking about?

01:26:52.045 --> 01:26:56.257
The second you stop appreciating
this piece of machinery,

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:58.176
then you give it to somebody else.

01:26:58.259 --> 01:26:59.511
Deal?

01:27:00.428 --> 01:27:01.429
Deal.

01:27:03.306 --> 01:27:04.683
Go ahead, man.

01:27:06.101 --> 01:27:07.477
God bless you, Danny Collins.

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:08.895
Back at ya.

01:27:09.145 --> 01:27:10.480
Whoo!

01:27:10.522 --> 01:27:12.607
How much does insurance even cost...

01:27:12.691 --> 01:27:15.026
Fuck it, I don't care. I don't care.

01:27:15.694 --> 01:27:16.778
- Watch your head.
- Okay.

01:27:25.995 --> 01:27:27.288
Okay, Danny.

01:27:28.498 --> 01:27:30.959
I don't want the last thing
I ever said to you to be mean,

01:27:31.042 --> 01:27:33.294
but I don't want to say anything nice.

01:27:33.378 --> 01:27:35.255
So, Mr. Collins,

01:27:35.338 --> 01:27:38.758
on behalf of the Woodcliff Lake Hilton,
we'd like to thank you for your stay.

01:27:39.676 --> 01:27:44.264
And we hope that you will make Hilton
a home wherever your travels take you.

01:27:46.516 --> 01:27:48.852
I'm grabbing a cab.

01:27:49.894 --> 01:27:51.062
I see that.

01:27:51.146 --> 01:27:54.899
I gave Nicky my Mercedes.

01:27:55.942 --> 01:27:59.654
You gave your Mercedes to Nicky?
You are fucking crazy.

01:27:59.738 --> 01:28:02.907
It's been said, yes. I
can afford it, though.

01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:05.785
Frank called me this morning
and we're going back on tour.

01:28:06.161 --> 01:28:09.831
I need the money. I got a family now.

01:28:10.206 --> 01:28:11.708
So...

01:28:11.791 --> 01:28:14.627
They hate my guts, but, uh...

01:28:14.711 --> 01:28:16.504
I'm told that's what families do.

01:28:16.963 --> 01:28:19.424
Yeah, that's right. I've taught you well.

01:28:19.841 --> 01:28:23.845
Yeah. I'm going to play my new songs.

01:28:24.304 --> 01:28:27.474
- Some of them. We'll see what happens.
- Ah.

01:28:28.266 --> 01:28:29.559
I know what will happen.

01:28:29.934 --> 01:28:33.688
- Yeah, they'll throw tomatoes at me.
- Yeah, and onions.

01:28:36.983 --> 01:28:39.819
You know, I'm going to be here
in a couple of months.

01:28:39.903 --> 01:28:42.322
You know, in the area.
We're playing the Garden.

01:28:42.489 --> 01:28:43.490
Oh.

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.533
Yeah, maybe you'll come by, see the show.

01:28:45.575 --> 01:28:49.204
We'll have, uh, dinner afterwards.

01:28:49.287 --> 01:28:51.623
You know what I like about you?
You never give up.

01:28:53.291 --> 01:28:55.502
Some dinners are worth fighting for.

01:29:00.632 --> 01:29:03.885
I left something in the room for ya.

01:29:03.968 --> 01:29:07.263
Yeah? You probably left me a big mess,
is what you left me.

01:29:07.347 --> 01:29:10.475
Well, you know, rock stars.

01:29:13.937 --> 01:29:15.397
So, uh...

01:29:17.524 --> 01:29:19.776
Another life, huh?

01:29:21.403 --> 01:29:23.446
You never know.

01:30:25.091 --> 01:30:27.302
- Oh. Hi.
- Hey.

01:30:27.427 --> 01:30:31.097
Hi, sorry, I don't think we met.
I'm Mary, the hotel manager.

01:30:31.181 --> 01:30:33.141
- You must be Busywork?
- Yeah.

01:30:33.183 --> 01:30:35.435
Uh, I'm Judd.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.688
- Judd, yeah, right. Okay, very good.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:30:38.772 --> 01:30:41.191
- Anyway, checkout's noon.
- Sweet.

01:31:09.886 --> 01:31:13.056
Christ, what, did he send you out here
to check up on me?

01:31:13.139 --> 01:31:15.558
Well, the hotel didn't know what to do
with the damn piano.

01:31:15.642 --> 01:31:17.477
So I thought you might want it.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.729
- I don't want his piano.
- Yeah?

01:31:19.854 --> 01:31:22.357
Well, it took six hours
to move it out of the Hilton

01:31:22.399 --> 01:31:25.068
and I don't know anyone else in New Jersey.
So tough shit.

01:31:26.486 --> 01:31:32.200
Look, it's a $30,000 instrument, Tom.
Sell it, for all I care.

01:31:36.705 --> 01:31:38.248
How's your health?

01:31:39.833 --> 01:31:41.501
I find out in a few days.

01:31:41.710 --> 01:31:42.711
Ah.

01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:45.255
Your age.

01:31:48.258 --> 01:31:51.261
You know, when I was in my 30s,
I started drinking, heavily.

01:31:52.095 --> 01:31:55.098
Ah. Long line of drunks in my family.

01:31:55.557 --> 01:31:57.767
All with the usual bullshit excuses.

01:31:57.892 --> 01:32:00.270
Careful, gentlemen!

01:32:00.395 --> 01:32:02.939
That is a Steinway!

01:32:03.064 --> 01:32:04.607
Yes, sir!

01:32:04.941 --> 01:32:10.238
Anyway, we were on tour in the Bay Area.
I fell asleep at the wheel.

01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.907
Almost killed myself and others.

01:32:12.949 --> 01:32:14.951
Danny bailed me out.

01:32:15.035 --> 01:32:19.122
5:00 in the morning, he shows up
at the San Jose police station,

01:32:19.247 --> 01:32:20.540
wacked out of his skull.

01:32:21.541 --> 01:32:27.464
He drives me six hours
to this Hollywood rehab joint

01:32:27.589 --> 01:32:30.216
drunker than I'd been the night before,
the dumb shit.

01:32:31.051 --> 01:32:34.804
He visited me every
Saturday till I got dry,

01:32:34.888 --> 01:32:37.932
and then once a week for 37 years,

01:32:37.974 --> 01:32:44.356
I get four cases of bottled water,
sent to me wherever I am in the world.

01:32:45.106 --> 01:32:47.108
Always with the same note.

01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:51.071
"Drink as many as you want. On me. Danny."

01:32:55.992 --> 01:32:58.328
Best friend I ever had, your father.

01:33:01.831 --> 01:33:06.086
Yeah, the man saved my life
and got me stone-cold sober.

01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:10.173
And was three sheets to the wind
the whole time he was doing it.

01:33:10.298 --> 01:33:12.842
I'm sorry, but I'm not seeing your point.

01:33:12.926 --> 01:33:15.345
The point, my boy,

01:33:16.179 --> 01:33:18.181
is that he's got a good heart.

01:33:18.807 --> 01:33:21.184
He just keeps it up his ass half the time.

01:33:22.769 --> 01:33:26.106
What you do with that is up to you.

01:33:26.815 --> 01:33:30.026
My waters will keep coming, no matter what.

01:33:30.527 --> 01:33:33.363
All right, boys, let's move that puppy!

01:33:33.446 --> 01:33:35.490
So I can get the fuck out of New Jersey.

01:33:47.335 --> 01:33:50.463
So I'll see you guys in Pittsburgh?

01:33:50.547 --> 01:33:55.885
Yeah. Frank is setting up the other events.
Okay, talk soon.

01:34:02.726 --> 01:34:05.812
Okay. Now let's take a look
at the computer system.

01:34:05.895 --> 01:34:07.731
I still don't know...

01:34:36.676 --> 01:34:38.678
Have fun at the doctor.

01:34:56.446 --> 01:34:58.948
Your favorite flower is...

01:35:00.617 --> 01:35:02.077
Rose.

01:35:02.410 --> 01:35:05.455
To smell it you breathe through your...

01:35:06.623 --> 01:35:11.378
Hold it in as long as you can go,
and let it out in one big...

01:36:39.507 --> 01:36:42.385
Hi. Tom Donnelly for Dr. Silverman.

01:36:42.469 --> 01:36:45.096
Sure. Just have a seat, Mr. Donnelly.

01:37:11.164 --> 01:37:13.541
So, uh, she's pissed?

01:37:13.583 --> 01:37:16.086
Nah, she's thrilled. Thanks for asking.

01:37:18.254 --> 01:37:21.591
Oh, that was such a horrible night for me.
It's no excuse.

01:37:21.716 --> 01:37:24.928
Well, I can assure you
it was a worse night for me.

01:37:30.433 --> 01:37:32.811
So she's not going to come at all?

01:37:38.525 --> 01:37:40.068
She can barely move.

01:37:41.444 --> 01:37:44.656
Doctor's got her on full bed rest now.

01:37:46.074 --> 01:37:48.785
Plus whatever this news is,
I'd rather she heard it from me.

01:37:48.868 --> 01:37:50.120
Not some doctor.

01:37:51.329 --> 01:37:52.706
Mr. Donnelly?

01:38:19.607 --> 01:38:21.651
Listen, if this news is bad...

01:38:22.444 --> 01:38:23.445
Tom...

01:38:23.486 --> 01:38:25.238
No, listen to me. Uh...

01:38:26.489 --> 01:38:28.241
If it's bad,

01:38:29.117 --> 01:38:31.161
Samantha, Hope and the baby...

01:38:31.244 --> 01:38:32.787
They'll be taken care of, Tom.

01:38:33.663 --> 01:38:36.124
- Don't even think about it.
- Okay.

01:38:36.166 --> 01:38:39.294
Okay. Good. Thank you.

01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.302
I am not ready to leave them.

01:38:49.596 --> 01:38:51.014
I'm not ready.

01:38:55.143 --> 01:38:58.938
You know, Tom, I've been thinking.

01:38:59.356 --> 01:39:02.692
I noticed something very interesting.

01:39:03.985 --> 01:39:06.363
Whenever this doctor comes in here,

01:39:07.781 --> 01:39:13.036
he either calls you Mr. Donnelly or Tom.

01:39:13.119 --> 01:39:14.371
You notice that?

01:39:14.954 --> 01:39:16.623
Always one or the other.

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:22.045
Now, when he calls you Mr. Donnelly,

01:39:22.712 --> 01:39:24.381
it's never good news.

01:39:25.006 --> 01:39:29.719
Next thing you know, he's shooting you up
with some stuff that makes you throw up.

01:39:29.844 --> 01:39:31.971
Or he doesn't like your levels.

01:39:32.889 --> 01:39:37.394
But when he calls you Tom,
it's always good news.

01:39:38.895 --> 01:39:44.401
I mean, the time he liked
your white cell count. Remember that?

01:39:44.526 --> 01:39:48.071
He calls you Tom.
It's here, I've been taking notes.

01:39:48.822 --> 01:39:54.536
Literally, every time, it's a good thing
when he calls you Tom.

01:39:55.078 --> 01:39:59.416
So this is what we want right now.

01:40:00.417 --> 01:40:05.422
We want him to come in here,
open that door, call you Tom.

01:40:07.924 --> 01:40:09.592
That's what we want.

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:12.012
You understand?

01:40:12.095 --> 01:40:14.597
So let's... Let's focus...

01:40:16.683 --> 01:40:18.393
On that.

01:40:18.435 --> 01:40:19.769
Okay?

01:40:20.937 --> 01:40:21.938
Okay.

01:40:24.566 --> 01:40:27.277
Everything's going to be all right, son.

01:40:28.528 --> 01:40:29.904
It's going to be all right.

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.365
You promise?

01:40:36.745 --> 01:40:39.539
Have I ever let you down before?

01:40:42.876 --> 01:40:44.794
You're a ridiculous man, you know that?

01:40:44.919 --> 01:40:48.131
I know. I've been told.

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.052
Okay.

01:40:54.304 --> 01:40:59.726
Yeah, he's going to come in here
and he's going to call you Tom.

01:41:03.938 --> 01:41:08.276
And everything's going
to be okay, all right?

01:41:09.611 --> 01:41:11.988
Everything's going to be okay.

01:41:22.165 --> 01:41:25.669
Okay, Tom, so here's where we are.

01:41:51.528 --> 01:41:53.697
<i>What happened was I did an interview</i>

01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:58.451
with a magazine called <i>Zig Zag</i> in 1971.

01:41:58.535 --> 01:42:01.371
Just after I've had my first album out.

01:42:01.454 --> 01:42:04.833
And in it, I was asked by the fellow
who was interviewing me

01:42:04.874 --> 01:42:06.376
whether I thought...

01:42:06.459 --> 01:42:07.877
If I, um...

01:42:09.212 --> 01:42:14.217
If I became, you know, rich
beyond the dreams of avarice, you know,

01:42:14.342 --> 01:42:18.054
whether it would affect my song writing,
you know, detrimentally.

01:42:18.179 --> 01:42:20.390
And I thought... I said I thought it would.

01:42:20.473 --> 01:42:22.684
Anyway, John, for some reason,

01:42:22.726 --> 01:42:25.645
took an exception to this
and wrote a letter in.

01:42:41.077 --> 01:42:43.413
<i>It was a very friendly letter.</i>

01:42:45.081 --> 01:42:49.252
<i>And he finished it with,
"Well, what do you think of that?"</i>

01:42:49.502 --> 01:42:52.213
<i>He had his own home
telephone number in Ascot.</i>

01:42:52.255 --> 01:42:56.092
<i>So, if I had got the letter, you know,
when he sent it, I would have rung him.</i>

01:42:56.176 --> 01:42:57.260
<i>Right, yeah.</i>
