00:02.303 --> 00:02.534
.

00:02.536 --> 00:04.370
- Dad, i messed up. I know it.
- I don't think you do.

00:04.371 --> 00:06.205
I'll see you in four years.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.439
- I don't know how
to get a hold of him.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.241
Just thought that he should know
that i'm...

00:09.243 --> 00:11.010
Well, pregnant.

00:11.012 --> 00:13.112
- Hey, listen,
i got a company on the side,

00:13.114 --> 00:14.346
Security business.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.181
I'm always looking
for off-duty cops.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.282
It's easy money.

00:17.284 --> 00:18.751
- Antonio dawson.
I'm here to...

00:18.753 --> 00:20.486
- Asher. Come in.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.787
This is my wife, layla.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.389
Keep your eye on her.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.501
We need to make a stop.

00:35.503 --> 00:36.802
- It's 4:00 a.M.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.570
- Well, it was
a productive trip,

00:38.572 --> 00:40.506
And i don't want these
in the house.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.104
All canadian-mined...

01:12.106 --> 01:15.107
Vvs-1 clarity,
clear to light gray--

01:15.109 --> 01:17.109
The best.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.677
This is what i bring you.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.146
[cell phone vibrates]

01:22.750 --> 01:24.249
- Easy there, slick.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.457
- [laughing]

01:31.459 --> 01:34.193
You do not get rattled.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.527
- Try not to.

01:35.529 --> 01:38.363
- Could use you
thursday night...

01:38.365 --> 01:40.466
Card game i like to attend.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.667
You have a moral
or ethical problem

01:41.669 --> 01:44.369
With a friendly game
of cards, antonio?

01:44.371 --> 01:46.238
- As long as it stays friendly.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.207
- [laughs]

01:48.209 --> 01:49.475
[kettle whistling]

01:49.477 --> 01:52.311
- Then i found out
i don't like reflexology.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.746
Plus, the instructor
kept looking down my shirt.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.683
So far, physical therapy
seems much more interesting.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.285
- So you and justin,
how long is this going on?

02:00.287 --> 02:02.354
- Nothing was really going on,

02:02.356 --> 02:04.423
But...

02:04.425 --> 02:06.859
I always liked him,
even in high school.

02:06.861 --> 02:09.178
He did his own thing.

02:09.179 --> 02:11.496
He was, like, mysterious,
you know?

02:11.499 --> 02:13.532
-<i> The maltese falcon </i>
is a mystery.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.300
Justin was a pain in the ass.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.802
- I was no walk in the park.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.638
Justin's, um...

02:19.640 --> 02:23.509
Your wife caught me chugging
vodka out of a snapple bottle

02:23.511 --> 02:24.910
At the sophomore dance.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.146
- Old eagle eye.
She turn you in?

02:27.148 --> 02:29.648
- Confiscated it,
gave me a little speech.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.751
- That's another specialty
of hers.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.556
- Justin's on leave
starting tomorrow.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.791
I feel like...

02:39.793 --> 02:41.493
I think we're gonna
be good at this.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.663
We just got to build
a foundation.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.532
- He's got
a four-year service commitment.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.767
- I know, and i feel bad
asking for more money.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.936
It's just--with paying
for classes and everything...

02:50.938 --> 02:52.704
- If it's for the baby,
just say so.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.407
- But that's not why i came.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.576
I really do want
to get to know you.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.512
I mean, we're gonna be
a family.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.314
- Wait here.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.766
You know whose house
you're in right now?

03:20.768 --> 03:22.901
- We know exactly
whose house we're in.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.270
Now open that box back up.

03:25.272 --> 03:26.705
- Why don't you come
and get it?

03:32.279 --> 03:34.880
- [screaming]

03:36.884 --> 03:39.351
- Aah!

03:39.353 --> 03:41.587
- Ugh!

03:45.526 --> 03:47.726
[footsteps running overhead]

03:47.728 --> 03:50.362
- Get the girl.

04:09.416 --> 04:09.648
.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.250
- Whoa.
Look at you.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.751
Rough night?

04:12.753 --> 04:15.020
- I'm not in the mood.
- Your wife called.

04:15.022 --> 04:18.490
- Well, good for her.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.392
- Hey, dawson.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.262
Heard it went good
with mr. Roslyn last night.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.563
- Yeah, he's got
a thursday-night gig

04:24.565 --> 04:25.631
He wants me for.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.266
- Thursday night--
i know it well.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.468
Look, the guy's a piece of work,
but you can handle it.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.037
Oh, also, he, uh--
he tips big when he's drunk.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.972
So, if he wants to stop
at the liquor store,

04:33.974 --> 04:35.807
I'd say stop
at the liquor store.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.347
- Ruzek.
- Yeah.

04:42.349 --> 04:43.715
- Hey.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.284
I left my cell phone
at your place.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.685
- Got it.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.024
- Hey, some guy
from h.Q. Called.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.492
Voight skipped
a com stat meeting.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.027
I tried but it went
straight to voice mail.

04:55.029 --> 04:57.329
- Weird.
I'll try him.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.034
- See?

05:02.036 --> 05:03.368
- I believed you.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.736
- Maybe he's sick.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.638
- He's never sick,
and he's never late.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.939
Jay...

05:10.077 --> 05:12.444
- [sighs]

05:12.446 --> 05:14.046
Oh, you get that?
Oh!

05:14.048 --> 05:17.549
[metallic banging]

05:17.551 --> 05:21.420
- Damn it.
Now she decides to call me.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.389
- He had the flu last year.

05:24.391 --> 05:27.059
No, he didn't.
That was you.

05:27.061 --> 05:29.027
- He gets sick.
Everybody gets sick.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.496
- Car's out front.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.566
[sighs]

05:37.037 --> 05:38.970
- Huh.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.439
- 'cause i'm special, is why.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.341
- Mm-hmm.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.575
- Hank?

05:49.483 --> 05:50.849
- Back door.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.852
- Phone.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.699
Blood.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.395
- Antonio...

06:36.397 --> 06:38.563
Take me off speaker.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.099
- Smashed his phone
so we couldn't track them.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.101
- You figure two guys?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.569
- At least.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.139
Somebody was here.
Coffee's voight, but tea...

06:47.141 --> 06:49.708
- Voight's not the only one
who got snatched.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.181
- What the hell
do you think this was?

06:56.183 --> 06:58.483
- Popcorn machine.
What do you think?

06:58.485 --> 07:01.153
- No, it was a safe.
That's what i think.

07:01.155 --> 07:03.188
So, if this was a safe,
then this is a robbery.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.190
- We don't know
what this was yet.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.592
So screw your head on straight
and get to work.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.461
- Al...

07:09.463 --> 07:10.562
You doing okay, man?

07:10.564 --> 07:12.464
- What'd i just say, huh?

07:14.835 --> 07:18.870
Your boss is missing,
so get to work, patrolman.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.940
- All right.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.157
- Okay.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.159
We don't got to wait on dna

07:41.161 --> 07:42.861
To find out
whose mug that was.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.763
We got it right here on video.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.004
- You sold out
of good & plenty?

07:53.006 --> 07:54.506
- Sold my one box
of good & plenty

07:54.508 --> 07:56.275
At the last district.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.043
- Hey, burgess, you want
to support the bridgeport blues?

07:58.045 --> 08:00.912
Sounds like a wonderful
fictitious basketball team.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.180
- That's profiling.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.248
We're a real team.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.050
I play small forward,

08:05.052 --> 08:07.552
But i don't start 'cause i'm
still developing my left hand.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.221
You want chocolate,
chocolate almonds?

08:09.223 --> 08:10.255
- Um...

08:10.257 --> 08:12.557
Chocolate almonds.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.159
- Is it true you got to buy
your own duty weapon,

08:14.161 --> 08:15.961
Or you just got to buy
the backup?

08:15.963 --> 08:17.262
- Oh, chicago police officers

08:17.264 --> 08:19.130
Are required to pay
for their own sidearm,

08:19.132 --> 08:20.265
Both primary and backup.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.067
- Hmm.
What you carry?

08:22.069 --> 08:23.568
I like a walther ppk.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.504
- You sound like
future police to me.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.855
- Or a hit man.

08:26.856 --> 08:28.205
- Cops make more money
than teachers.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.207
And i heard that.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.742
- Okay, fund-raiser's over.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.977
Chop-chop.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.282
- Hey.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.116
You ever want to do
police explorers

08:39.119 --> 08:41.285
Or have other questions,
call me, okay?

08:41.288 --> 08:42.854
I'm kim.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.121
- Okay.

08:46.593 --> 08:48.560
- Hey, roman.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.761
Sorry i'm late.

08:49.762 --> 08:50.961
I ran into that girl
selling candy.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.297
She's a trip.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.199
- And where's your star,
officer?

08:57.304 --> 09:01.006
- That little bitch--
she stole my badge.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.841
- Hey, she left you your gun.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.844
I'll give you a loner.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.613
- Voight had cameras
at the front and back doors.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.550
Front door, 7:00 this morning,
this girl arrives.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.920
7:30, two unknown offenders
enter the back.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.022
Now, we can't see if voight
or the girl lets them in.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.824
Five minutes later,
this girl is seen leaving.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.027
One of the male subjects
escorts her back inside.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.595
- Ten minutes after that,

09:23.597 --> 09:24.796
They exit the back
with the girl.

09:24.798 --> 09:25.964
They're carrying voight out.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.132
He appears to be unconscious.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.667
- We got to put out
an all-call message

09:28.669 --> 09:30.101
And get a city-wide
search going.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.737
- No, 'cause we don't know
what voight was into.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.972
We're gonna bring him
home safe.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.740
We do it ourselves.
We keep this in-house.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.176
Now, the girl is olive morgan.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.211
It's a girl justin dated
when he was in town.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.080
- Yeah, i remember her
from back in the day.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.882
I wouldn't figure her for this.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.683
- We got to run her
through every database we got,

09:45.686 --> 09:48.053
See if her phone is active,
get her family, credit cards.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.055
She could be connected
to these two, whoever they are.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.623
- "connected"?
She could have set it up.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.857
- For what it's worth,

09:52.859 --> 09:54.593
Ruzek doesn't think
they're local.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.629
So he's figuring
something else out.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.698
- [sighs]

10:06.807 --> 10:08.773
- He's as tough as they come.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.714
- How did they get him
out of the house, al?

10:17.351 --> 10:18.850
- Listen...

10:18.852 --> 10:21.019
We're gonna find him.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.658
- [sniffles]

10:31.732 --> 10:33.298
- [groans]

10:37.237 --> 10:39.337
- He's a used-up copper.
He'll break.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.940
- What about the girl?
She got it done.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.046
- You really think
my team won't find me

10:48.048 --> 10:49.914
Before you crack that box?

10:54.187 --> 10:57.722
- A lot of guys
think they're tough.

10:57.724 --> 11:00.392
Let's see how tough
you really are.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.394
- [groaning]

11:02.396 --> 11:03.695
Ah!

11:03.697 --> 11:06.765
[groaning]

11:07.934 --> 11:09.300
- See?

11:09.302 --> 11:11.036
Not so tough.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.438
Now, what's the combination?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.442
- Okay.
Thanks.

11:17.444 --> 11:20.412
- All right, the little guy--
ian marks.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.047
Lka came back denver.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.115
- I ran his name through
the face the nation database.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.884
His whole family's
nothing but crooks.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.385
No match on the partner.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.821
- The head of this unit's
missing four hours already.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.189
We need more.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.258
- Detective.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.229
Cell phone towers?
- That was fast.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.398
- I flirted with the girl
at u.S. Cellular.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.233
- Over the phone?
- Yeah.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.369
- Idiot pinged a local tower.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.438
Looks like marks called
his family back in denver.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.624
- Can't be that stupid.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.809

of these jagoffs' names now.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.781
- Great. Let's run
the big guy's name.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.488
Right.

23:17.997 --> 23:21.132
- She's at the hospital--
olive?

23:21.134 --> 23:22.633
[door closes]

23:22.635 --> 23:25.136
- Mm.

23:25.138 --> 23:28.005
- You need me to deal
with justin at all--

23:28.007 --> 23:29.039
Delay him or anything,

23:29.041 --> 23:31.976
Walk him through
what's going on?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.548
You don't want my advice,

23:37.550 --> 23:41.485
So i'm just gonna tell you
what i think you would tell me.

23:41.487 --> 23:45.156
Don't blow this.
Lean on your team.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.703
- You can find them now?
- Don't worry about that.

23:59.705 --> 24:02.106
Just--just rest up.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.175
Keep that baby healthy.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.077
- I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.130
- I know.

24:09.131 --> 24:11.182
- A baby's supposed
to be a good thing.

24:11.184 --> 24:14.018
- It's gonna be okay.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.654
[cell phone vibrating]

24:16.656 --> 24:18.722
One second.

24:21.127 --> 24:24.195
Justin, everything all right?

24:24.197 --> 24:27.164
Just travel safe.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.901
We'll see you tomorrow.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.803
- No priors on lukasz gregorie.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.738
We can't even prove this guy
had a sandwich in philly,

24:34.740 --> 24:35.940
Let alone done a double murder.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.475
- We got nothing from the van.

24:37.477 --> 24:40.744
It was torched to the rims--
no prints,<i> nada.</i>

24:42.181 --> 24:45.483
- Look, this maniac
is on someone's list.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.218
I mean, somewhere
he jumped a turnstile,

24:47.220 --> 24:50.721
Ran a red light.
Someone bailed him out.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.224
I mean, i want every phone,
every camera we have

24:53.226 --> 24:56.060
On everyone he knows.

24:56.062 --> 24:59.997
I want leads.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.166
One hour.

25:02.168 --> 25:06.270
- Guess i'm gonna recheck
the pods on voight's block.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.139
- All right.
I find prayer also helps.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.842
- Sergeant voight wanted me to
pick up justin from the airport.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.945
What do i tell him?
- Nothing, absolutely nothing.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.247
- Okay.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.852
- Guy here to see voight.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.587
- Now's really not a good time.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.289
- Says his name is ian marks.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.795
- Hank?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.136
- I got information you want.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.774
Figure the safest place for me
is lockup.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.242
Don't want to end up
like some of the other guys

25:45.244 --> 25:46.844
You dealt with, you know?

25:50.783 --> 25:52.816
- Cuff him.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.285
- That's why i'm here!

25:54.287 --> 25:57.755
I knew we could work
something out.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.024
Hey, you don't got to check it.
It's all there--

26:00.026 --> 26:02.293
I mean, my half at least.

26:02.295 --> 26:04.028
- I got him.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.195
- Ah!

26:05.197 --> 26:07.064
Wait.
Hey, wait.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.166
Wait. Where are we going?
Arrest me, man.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.200
Hey, anybody see this?

26:10.202 --> 26:12.169
Hey, you got witnesses, man.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.072
Hey, you guys are all witnesses,
you sons of bitches!

26:29.989 --> 26:32.790
If this is about your money,
i'll get you the money, i swear.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.325
What do you want from me?
- Get out.

26:34.327 --> 26:35.993
- Gregorie's got
your little pouch.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.061
I don't even know
what's in there.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.062
So, if that's what
this is about,

26:38.064 --> 26:39.063
You got the wrong guy!

26:39.065 --> 26:41.732
You got the wrong guy, i swear!

26:41.734 --> 26:43.801
- Walk.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.903
Walk.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.101
.

27:00.102 --> 27:01.018
- Stop.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.354
- You don't have to do this.
We can still cut a deal.

27:03.356 --> 27:05.089
What do you want from me?

27:05.091 --> 27:07.024
If you kill me,
you'll never find him.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.829
- Bring me lukasz gregorie,

27:11.831 --> 27:14.665
And i let you live.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.033
That's your deal.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.102
- What the hell kind of deal
is that?

27:18.104 --> 27:19.236
[gasps]
okay.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.105
If--if i bring him in--

27:21.107 --> 27:22.573
The guy's got bodies on him.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.040
I want it in writing--
i get witness protection

27:24.043 --> 27:26.076
Before i get
anywhere close to him.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.681
- Nod yes if you're
still interested

27:30.683 --> 27:33.217
In my first and final offer.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.052
- Uh, yes, yes.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.954
- Gregorie goes down,
and you live.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.089
I'd say that's
a pretty good deal, yes?

27:39.091 --> 27:40.991
- Yes.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.793
[whimpering]

27:42.795 --> 27:47.131
- One more question...

27:47.133 --> 27:49.033
Olive morgan...

27:49.035 --> 27:51.168
Is she involved?

27:51.170 --> 27:54.705
Hmm?
- No.

27:54.707 --> 27:55.906
[gun cocks]

27:55.908 --> 27:58.108
- Final answer, ian.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.146
You sure?

28:02.148 --> 28:04.982
- Yes, i'm sure.

28:04.984 --> 28:07.017
- Look at me.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.889
Now you're under arrest.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.257
- Ah!

28:13.259 --> 28:16.026
- We're just trying
to locate her.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.928
The school said monica
lives with her mom.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.547
We went by.

28:19.548 --> 28:21.165
Neighbors told us
she's been staying with you.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.701
- Her mother's house
is unfit for a child--

28:23.703 --> 28:26.336
People coming and going,
drugs and whatnot.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.072
Her father's in prison,

28:28.074 --> 28:30.107
And he don't know the words
"good behavior."

28:30.109 --> 28:33.077
Monica's the best thing
this family ever did.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.445
She's got straight "a"s.

28:34.447 --> 28:36.814
- She's also been absent
from school the past two days.

28:36.816 --> 28:37.815
We checked.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.183
- But she left this morning.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.118
- If she's not at school,
where is she likely to be?

28:41.120 --> 28:43.087
Because she's not at school.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.321
- You think i'm lying?

28:44.323 --> 28:46.790
- We're just looking
for your granddaughter.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.125
She could be in real trouble.

28:51.797 --> 28:54.031
- I don't know where they go.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.800
But she always walks
her little sister home

28:56.802 --> 28:58.902
From the playground
after school.

28:58.904 --> 29:02.139
She--she looks out
for that girl.

29:02.141 --> 29:05.943
- Thank you.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.011
- I don't know
where he's at now.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.047
Deal was, after the house,
we split up,

29:10.049 --> 29:11.782
And we both took half the cash.

29:11.784 --> 29:14.184
- Your contact arranged
for a way out.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.219
- Josie?
No.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.520
Uh, gregorie's people.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.822
We meet up at 3:00
at northerly island.

29:18.824 --> 29:20.891
Some guy i never met
is gonna take us up to ontario.

29:20.893 --> 29:24.061
- You better not be playing us,
because if you are...

29:24.063 --> 29:26.296
- Yeah, yeah,
you work for a psycho.

29:26.298 --> 29:29.066
Guess what?
We all do.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.502
- So how much you think
voight had in that safe--

29:31.504 --> 29:33.170
About half a mil?

29:33.172 --> 29:34.538
- Dude,
didn't you hear antonio?

29:34.540 --> 29:37.908
- Come on, man,
you ain't thought about it?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.143
- I'd say half a mil, easy.

29:39.145 --> 29:42.179
[zipper closes]

29:42.181 --> 29:44.114
Here, put this on.

29:44.116 --> 29:47.084
There's a microphone
behind the belt buckle.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.786
- What if gregorie
checks the bag?

29:48.788 --> 29:50.354
- That's what
the flash roll is for.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.789
Aren't you supposed to be,

29:51.790 --> 29:53.223
Like, a professional crook
or something?

29:53.225 --> 29:54.358
You got any rap at all?

29:54.360 --> 29:55.959
- It's an open concourse.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.462
We'll maintain visual
and audio contact throughout.

29:58.464 --> 30:02.132
And if things go pear-shaped,
we'll drop your partner.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.268
Promise you that.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.839
- You guys are scarier
than the criminals.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.975
- Keep that in mind.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.279
[ferry horn blows]

30:40.306 --> 30:42.272
- Look sharp.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.222
- Any problems on your end?

30:58.224 --> 30:59.389
- We're good.
Boat's waiting.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.325
- It's all there?

31:12.238 --> 31:13.437
- It's getting cold out.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.005
- Gun!

31:15.007 --> 31:18.342
[gunshot,
people screaming]

31:19.478 --> 31:21.211
- Out of the way!

31:21.213 --> 31:22.946
- Chicago police!

31:29.922 --> 31:31.288
- Gregorie!

31:31.290 --> 31:32.656
- Aah!

31:32.658 --> 31:34.591
- Clear out!
Clear out!

31:34.593 --> 31:36.994
Everybody step back!

31:36.996 --> 31:39.062
Out of the way.

31:42.534 --> 31:42.966
.

31:42.968 --> 31:45.202
- Don't move.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.170
I will waste this bitch.

31:47.172 --> 31:49.339
- No one else has to die here.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.908
- That's up to you.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.376
Lose the guns.

31:52.378 --> 31:55.045
Lose the guns right now!

32:02.288 --> 32:03.921
- Move, and i will shoot.

32:03.923 --> 32:07.391
Nice and easy, drop the gun.
Release the girl.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.693
- It's over.
Let her go.

32:09.695 --> 32:10.994
- Do it!
- It's over.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.530
- Do it!

32:13.532 --> 32:15.465
Drop it! Drop it!

32:15.467 --> 32:16.466
- Ugh!

32:16.468 --> 32:18.468
- Put your hands
above your head.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.704
- [growls]

32:25.945 --> 32:28.612
- Where is it?

32:31.550 --> 32:33.450
- Come here.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.059
- Get him up.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.995
Get him up!
- Get up.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.202
- I got him.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.271
- [grunting]

32:58.377 --> 33:01.078
Come on!

33:03.248 --> 33:05.315
- [spits]

33:26.772 --> 33:30.040
[breathing heavily]

33:56.368 --> 33:57.667
- Lukasz gregorie,

33:57.669 --> 34:00.303
These two officers
will now transfer you

34:00.305 --> 34:02.572
To central detention
for processing.

34:02.574 --> 34:03.673
- Hold on.

34:03.675 --> 34:07.077
- [breathing heavily]

34:09.148 --> 34:12.114
One day you're gonna realize
how lucky you got.

34:12.117 --> 34:14.184
- Let's go.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.458
- Hank, you didn't have
to come back here tonight.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.500
It is just really good
to see you.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.436
That's all.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.317
- Principal got five complaints
of monica's little sister

34:47.319 --> 34:50.620
Getting beat up at recess
by some punk.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.089
- That punk?

34:52.091 --> 34:53.757
- I ain't gonna say it again.
Hey!

34:53.759 --> 34:55.391
- Oh, i'm gonna kill her. I am.
Take my gun.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.592
- Wait, wait.
Give her a minute.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.129
- You leave crystal adams alone.

34:59.131 --> 35:02.232
- Excuse me, officer.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.169
- Next time you see me,
i'm putting the cuffs on.

35:06.171 --> 35:08.705
I rule these streets.
Don't you forget.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.474
Now get out of here!

35:16.248 --> 35:18.215
- You know we could arrest
your ass right now?

35:18.217 --> 35:20.383
- I know.

35:20.385 --> 35:21.651
But before my mom passed,

35:21.653 --> 35:23.820
I promised i'd look after
my little sister,

35:23.822 --> 35:25.489
And i do what i got to do
to keep her safe,

35:25.491 --> 35:27.224
Like i said i would.

35:27.226 --> 35:30.494
- Next time you need help,
you call the police.

35:30.496 --> 35:32.129
Don't rob them.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.830
- You don't think
i haven't called the cops?

35:33.832 --> 35:35.499
- Not this one.

35:38.604 --> 35:39.903
- Sorry.

35:39.905 --> 35:43.373
- Hey...

35:43.375 --> 35:44.841
I ever see you
in that uniform again,

35:44.843 --> 35:47.210
You're gonna be a very different
flavor of sorry.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.583
- What flavor would that be?
- I don't know.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.252
- Huh.

35:55.254 --> 35:58.188
- [whistling]

35:59.691 --> 36:01.324
- Hey, ruzek.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.592
- Al.

36:02.594 --> 36:05.595
- Listen, uh,
since you were curious,

36:05.597 --> 36:07.597
The reason i was short
with you earlier

36:07.599 --> 36:10.267
Is because i just found out
that my wife of 20 years

36:10.269 --> 36:12.802
Has been stepping out on me
with a family friend.

36:12.804 --> 36:16.306
So...You wanted to be
in a big-boy conversation.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.275
Now you're in one.

36:18.277 --> 36:21.178
- Yeah.

36:21.180 --> 36:24.781
Jeez.
You know...

36:24.783 --> 36:28.185
I mean, al, you do live
in the garage, you know.

36:28.187 --> 36:29.536
I mean, i know you live there

36:29.537 --> 36:30.886
To be close to your daughter
and everything.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.200
I just thought that--

36:32.201 --> 36:33.512
- Listen, man,
i live in the garage

36:33.513 --> 36:34.824
Because i couldn't give up
on my family.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.693
- What do you
expect her to do?

36:40.199 --> 36:42.632
- You gonna start in on me now?
- No, i'm on your side, al.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.085
But, you know, what,

36:45.086 --> 36:47.537
Is she gonna be frozen in time
for a decade?

36:47.539 --> 36:49.639
You're angry. Be angry.
I'd be angry.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.608
But...

36:51.610 --> 36:53.276
I don't know.

36:53.278 --> 36:55.212
You want her back,

36:55.214 --> 36:57.314
You should fight for her.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.322
Come on, let's go.
I'll get you a beer, all right?

37:05.324 --> 37:06.523
I'm buying.
- Yeah.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.900
- You a big player?

37:19.238 --> 37:21.238
Poker, i mean.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.872
- [sighs]

37:22.874 --> 37:25.542
I play for swedish fish
with my son.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.344
Probably not like your--
- husband?

37:27.346 --> 37:30.280
My husband, asher.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.883
He's really something,
isn't he?

37:33.885 --> 37:35.385
- You'd know better than me.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.258
- What are you?

37:41.260 --> 37:42.859
- I'm loyal.

37:45.364 --> 37:48.865
- [breathes deeply]

37:51.470 --> 37:52.802
To whom?

37:52.804 --> 37:55.672
- Mrs. Roslyn,
your hand is on my leg.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.040
- Call me layla.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.442
- Layla...

37:59.444 --> 38:02.579
Your hand is on my leg.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.547
- [laughs]

38:04.549 --> 38:07.984
Do you know what you
and my husband have in common?

38:09.955 --> 38:11.354
Nothing.

38:11.356 --> 38:13.523
- He bothering you?

38:13.525 --> 38:14.591
- No.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.393
Are you gonna try?

38:16.395 --> 38:17.761
Oh, i can smell it on you.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.396
- What'd i say
when you took this job?

38:19.398 --> 38:22.065
I said to keep an eye
on my wife.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.900
- Okay, you've clearly had
a bad night at the tab--

38:23.902 --> 38:25.652
- No.

38:25.653 --> 38:27.403
I say take her to bed,
make me look like a fool?

38:27.406 --> 38:28.905
Was i unclear in any way?

38:31.777 --> 38:34.644
Go get my coat,
then bring the car around.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.917
- Erin lindsay.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.952
- Steve kot.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.721
Am i in trouble here?

38:44.723 --> 38:48.792
- No trouble.
I want to take you to dinner.

38:48.794 --> 38:52.762
- It's late, i'm beat,
and i don't date lawyers.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.764
I don't even really
like lawyers.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.967
- It's not a date.
It's a job offer.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.337
I'm here on behalf
of the state's attorney.

39:00.339 --> 39:04.774
How does running your own
task force for the feds sound?

39:04.776 --> 39:07.510
- Uh...
[scoffs]

39:07.512 --> 39:09.846
Listen, thanks
for the offer, but...

39:09.848 --> 39:12.265
- Think about it.

39:12.266 --> 39:14.683
If you get hungry and you want
to talk about it, even better.

39:34.773 --> 39:38.108
- Heh.
- Olive's asleep.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.643
She was...

39:40.645 --> 39:44.147
Pretty tired.

39:44.149 --> 39:47.851
- What'd the doctor say?

39:47.853 --> 39:51.688
- He said the baby's
doing real good.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.656
It's a boy.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.861
- A boy.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.797
- Yeah, how about that?

40:00.799 --> 40:02.165
- Oh, well...

40:02.167 --> 40:04.534
[both laugh]

40:04.536 --> 40:05.969
- Yeah.

40:09.141 --> 40:10.440
- You look good.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.644
- I feel good.

40:14.646 --> 40:17.147
I met with a recruiter.
I'm thinking about signal corps.

40:17.149 --> 40:19.849
- Signal corps, that's...

40:19.851 --> 40:21.518
I mean, you need college
for that.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.454
- Yeah, i'm thinking
about college too.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.623
- Got a lot on your mind.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.992
- Yeah, all of a sudden, yeah.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.963
Dad, i didn't know.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.832
Olive just told me
what you went through.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.000
I--
- ah...

40:37.002 --> 40:39.035
- I just--
did you get the guys?

40:39.037 --> 40:41.704
- Yeah, one's--
one's dead.

40:41.706 --> 40:44.207
The other's...

40:44.209 --> 40:46.743
Never gonna see
the outside of a cell.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.081
- I want you to know...

40:52.083 --> 40:55.185
That this is my family,

40:55.187 --> 40:57.520
And i'm gonna keep them safe.

40:59.491 --> 41:03.226
All right,
i'm gonna turn in.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.061
But...

41:05.063 --> 41:07.130
Thank you.

41:12.471 --> 41:14.604
Okay.

41:14.606 --> 41:15.538
- Justin...

41:18.143 --> 41:19.509
Look, there's--

41:19.511 --> 41:21.544
As long as olive's
moving to the base...

41:26.685 --> 41:28.468
You know, maybe you should--

41:28.469 --> 41:30.252
You should think about making
an honest woman of her.

41:36.628 --> 41:39.696
It's your mother's ring.
