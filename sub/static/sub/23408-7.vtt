WEBVTT

00:06.080 --> 00:07.080
Look me in the eye now.
Can you see me?

00:08.320 --> 00:10.720
You're the
best friend ever.

00:10.760 --> 00:11.720
Rubbish, mate.
You are.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.000
I want to hear all about it.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.400
- Formation!

00:19.440 --> 00:20.680
Hold!

00:20.720 --> 00:21.720
What's it for, sir?

00:21.760 --> 00:22.800
Valour.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.960
Bravery in extremis.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.640
When he starts talking,
you come and get me.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.160
Might help
jog his memory.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.240
Get up!
Move!

00:32.280 --> 00:33.400
Getting out of here.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.360
I am Brenna.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.400
The goddess of war?

00:37.440 --> 00:38.640
I need you to lie with me.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.600
Well, I expect
I could spare five minutes.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.280
Kneel!
From this night,

00:42.320 --> 00:45.840
you are Queen Kerra
of the Cantii.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.320
The prophecy tells
that Brenna will be rescued

00:48.360 --> 00:50.560
by a golden-haired mortal.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.520
Islene was killed
by a Roman.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.920
I'll see here again
when I die.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.120
Dad said there's a place
for the ones the gods love most.

00:57.160 --> 00:57.920
Now, listen to me!

00:57.960 --> 00:58.960
You are The One!

00:59.000 --> 01:01.360
It's you!
Now go!

01:21.520 --> 01:22.800
Ah, there you are.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.320
So, how do I look?

01:29.120 --> 01:30.880
Wait there.
I'll be back.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.760
Don't worry.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.880
I'm not going anywhere.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.680
Ah!

01:47.240 --> 01:48.880
What was that thing?

01:48.920 --> 01:50.200
At the citadel?

01:51.120 --> 01:52.080
What thing?

01:52.120 --> 01:53.080
Oh, come on, now.
I may be blind,

01:53.120 --> 01:54.800
but don't tell me
that was a man.

01:54.840 --> 01:55.800
That was something else.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.520
Why was it after you?

01:58.560 --> 01:59.760
It must have been a mistake.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.600
Hey...

02:00.640 --> 02:01.640
Now, keep still.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.400
Why aren't you telling me
the truth, girl?

02:05.440 --> 02:06.600
What is it
you're hiding?

02:10.560 --> 02:11.880
I don't know what it was.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.760
Where are we?

02:17.800 --> 02:20.440
About five miles
from Locerly.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.560
We'll stop the night there.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.000
At least you'll
know your way around.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.560
What is it, child?

02:26.600 --> 02:28.360
Mm?
What's wrong?

02:28.400 --> 02:30.200
Nothing.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.240
Come, now.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.360
I may be blind,

02:32.400 --> 02:33.280
but I can still feel
the weather change.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.360
Spill it, now.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.040
Will we ever be safe again?

02:44.480 --> 02:45.480
Come here.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.720
When I was a boy,

02:48.760 --> 02:51.160
my dad used to row us out
to this tiny island.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.680
If we find a boat,
with the right tide,

02:54.720 --> 02:56.320
we can find
that island again.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.560
I mean, not much there
except some goats,

02:59.600 --> 03:02.120
and an old stone
shack'll need a roof,

03:02.160 --> 03:04.280
but I do know one thing
it doesn't have.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.160
Romans.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.000
I saw you...

03:11.040 --> 03:12.200
at the camp.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.360
Your face was the very
last thing I ever saw.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.280
I'll never forget it.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.040
It's right here.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.080
Forever.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.240
Supper time!

05:21.280 --> 05:22.280
I'm not hungry.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.480
You have to eat.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.680
We have a full day's
travelling tomorrow.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.800
Don't be offended,
but I'm going to pass.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.920
Does my cooking
not please you?

05:35.280 --> 05:36.520
What's that?

05:36.560 --> 05:37.600
That is wind-
willow grass.

05:37.640 --> 05:38.680
It fortifies the blood.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.000
It's not
wind-willow grass.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.880
It's grass...

05:42.920 --> 05:44.800
and this, mm?
What's this?

05:44.840 --> 05:46.400
That is a rare
and precious algae.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.640
It only grows
on the west bank of the river.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.400
Ania, it's not algae.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.400
It's not rare or
precious anything.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.080
It's mud.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.120
This...

05:54.160 --> 05:55.960
this is a beetle.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.040
This is possibly
a piece of flint,

05:59.080 --> 06:00.320
more likely
badger shit,

06:00.360 --> 06:01.840
but mostly mud.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.160
This is a mud pie.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.160
That is Regni food.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.200
It may be Regni.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.400
It's not food.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.240
Did I complain
about that horseshit

06:08.280 --> 06:09.880
you Cantii bastards
fed me in jail?

06:09.920 --> 06:10.880
Those leaves
and twigs

06:10.920 --> 06:12.520
that you boiled up
this morning?

06:12.560 --> 06:14.280
It's called
Bramble-Beard Soup.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.640
Have you noticed

06:15.680 --> 06:18.040
that I am not able
to walk for more than 50 paces

06:18.080 --> 06:19.560
without stopping for a crap?

06:19.600 --> 06:22.000
I haven't crapped so much
in my entire previous life

06:22.040 --> 06:23.400
up until now.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.640
I have doubled my overall
lifetime tally of craps.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.120
It's an acquired taste.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.000
You'll get used to it.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.360
Mmm...

06:37.240 --> 06:40.400
Let me ask you a question,
Princess Ania.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.120
Have you ever cooked before?
Anything, ever?

06:42.160 --> 06:44.960
You don't know
the first thing about me,

06:45.000 --> 06:46.400
Prince Phelan.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.640
Unlike you,
I grew up in the forest.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.400
Besides,
I am not Ania of the Regni.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.720
No, you're Brenna,
the goddess of war.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.320
And destruction,
and dreams, and wells.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.360
Yeah, exactly.
Not cooking.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.840
Not Brenna,
the goddess of dinner.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.120
Let us not
quarrel, my love.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.480
There's another thing.
I'm not your love.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.280
The prophecy said
nothing about love.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.320
I am the fair-haired mortal
who saves you.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.320
That is it.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.640
If you cannot
respect me,

07:08.680 --> 07:11.440
then at least respect
the bounty of the forest.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.280
From its floor to its
highest branches,

07:13.320 --> 07:15.400
the forest is sacred.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.760
I respect the branches.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.400
I respect the forest floor.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.120
I just don't want to eat it.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.960
So where does this prophecy
send us next, anyway?

07:23.000 --> 07:23.960
The gods will guide...

07:24.000 --> 07:25.480
Ugh, the gods.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.000
Patience,
my love.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.400
I'm not your love.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.160
Whoa!

08:33.440 --> 08:34.520
Here.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.280
Not hungry, eh?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.159
How about a
drop of this?

08:44.200 --> 08:45.600
Don't ask me
what it is,

08:45.640 --> 08:46.600
but Philo, old son,

08:46.640 --> 08:48.840
it's got a kick.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.680
All the more for me.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.400
What is this place?

09:27.440 --> 09:28.800
Locerly.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.960
Formerly a thriving
Cantii trading post,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.520
'til the Romans showed up.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.720
Now look at it.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.800
Well, if this
is a village,

09:37.840 --> 09:38.800
there should be
a river,

09:38.840 --> 09:40.440
or a well.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.360
Shouldn't you be
a bit more certain than that,

09:42.400 --> 09:44.680
being Brenna, the
goddess of wells?

09:46.040 --> 09:47.680
Shouldn't you,
above anyone,

09:47.720 --> 09:49.120
know if they've
got one or not?

09:49.160 --> 09:51.880
You really don't understand
how this works, do you?

09:51.920 --> 09:53.080
No, you're right.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.280
I've absolutely no idea
what the job entails.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.520
All I know
is that I'm travelling

09:56.560 --> 09:57.800
with Brenna,
the goddess of wells,

09:57.840 --> 10:00.320
and I'm fucking parched.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.320
I've never been
so thirsty.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.480
Hello, pretty things.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.680
There you go.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.200
Water.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.480
Thank you.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.120
Oh, sweet gods of mercy.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.480
Who is it?

10:56.520 --> 10:57.320
A man and a woman.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.880
Did you
recognize them?

10:58.920 --> 10:59.920
Are they villagers?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.480
No, didn't recognize them.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.560
Did they see you?

11:02.600 --> 11:04.880
No, don't think so.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.240
Two tasty things,
one of each.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.320
I might pop over there later,
see what I can find.

11:10.360 --> 11:11.360
Know what I mean?

11:16.280 --> 11:18.720
Oh, for god's sake, Philo.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.560
Fucking say something!

11:29.480 --> 11:30.360
Back at
the citadel...

11:30.400 --> 11:32.560
what did the Queen say to you,

11:32.600 --> 11:34.120
as we were escaping?

11:35.480 --> 11:37.240
I didn't hear.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.760
I did.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.720
Loud and clear.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.800
She said, "You are The One."

11:44.000 --> 11:45.200
Now, what do you think
she meant by that?

11:46.920 --> 11:48.040
Who knows what she meant?

11:48.080 --> 11:49.440
If I've learned
one thing,

11:49.480 --> 11:51.920
it's that people talk nonsense.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.560
"You are The One."
That's what she said.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.080
She's here.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.440
We can stay here for the night,

12:55.480 --> 12:58.880
travel on to the Druids
at daybreak.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.840
Phelan?

13:04.880 --> 13:06.120
Where are you?

13:06.160 --> 13:09.240
Take a wild guess.

13:10.680 --> 13:11.920
So tell me more
about this prophecy.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.280
What exactly
do you want to know?

13:14.320 --> 13:15.400
How specific
does it get?

13:15.440 --> 13:16.720
In fact,
to avoid confusion,

13:16.760 --> 13:19.200
why don't you just tell me
the whole prophecy?

13:19.240 --> 13:21.520
"In the beginning,
there was only fire.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.080
The fire spread
across the darkness

13:24.120 --> 13:26.160
to the four corners
of the Universe."

13:26.200 --> 13:27.320
You can skip
to the bit...

13:27.360 --> 13:28.960
let's start where
I come in, yeah?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.200
The fair-haired mortal.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.720
In fact...

13:31.760 --> 13:33.600
jump to the bit where
we leave the citadel.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.440
What happens next?

13:35.480 --> 13:39.520
Brenna and her mortal saviour
go to visit the archdruid Veran.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.680
Can I stop you there?

13:44.720 --> 13:46.320
and passed me over
as King of my own tribe?

13:46.360 --> 13:48.000
Veran the Second Man, yes.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.440
The creator
of my every misfortune...

13:50.480 --> 13:51.760
from that bitch wife
he hooked me up with

13:51.800 --> 13:53.840
all the way to watching my dad
get disembowelled

13:53.880 --> 13:55.400
and his entrails
fed to the crows, yeah?

13:55.440 --> 13:57.720
He's my big hope?

13:57.760 --> 13:58.920
Did it cross your mind

13:58.960 --> 14:00.200
that the gods paired you
with your wife

14:00.240 --> 14:02.200
for a larger purpose?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.560
That you were passed over
as King

14:03.600 --> 14:05.480
because the gods had
another plan for you...

14:05.520 --> 14:06.640
a greater fate?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.480
Honestly? No. That
hadn't crossed my mind.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.640
I was too busy having
a fucking terrible time.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.320
And yet, it makes
perfect sense.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.400
Had you been crowned
King of the Cantii,

14:14.440 --> 14:16.080
you would have had
no reason to free me.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.520
We would not be here now.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.680
Right,
and being here now...

14:18.720 --> 14:20.520
that's supposed to be
a good thing, is it?

14:20.560 --> 14:22.720
Being here now,
in this hovel,

14:22.760 --> 14:25.360
with a fucking typhoon
blowing in my bowels,

14:25.400 --> 14:26.800
that's better than being
king of my people?

14:26.840 --> 14:28.800
That's my big break?

14:28.840 --> 14:31.200
When will you accept
the truth, Phelan?

14:31.240 --> 14:34.640
You have been honoured
by the gods.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.520
You are blessed.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.560
It's not as if Veran
isn't aware of the prophecy.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.000
How exactly
is Veran aware of the prophecy?

14:45.480 --> 14:46.760
Because he wrote it.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.400
What?

14:49.440 --> 14:51.120
Every word...

14:51.160 --> 14:54.920
on the face of my great,
great grandfather...

14:56.120 --> 14:58.880
two thousand moons ago.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.720
When I joined up...

15:10.720 --> 15:11.840
I had a dream...

15:11.880 --> 15:14.800
to travel to new
and exotic places.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.640
See, hear, and taste
the unknown.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.640
Experiences
beyond the wildest stretches

15:18.680 --> 15:19.800
of a young man's imagination.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.840
Wonder. Knowledge.
Wisdom.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.400
I would become,
in short, a man.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.040
Last week,

15:33.080 --> 15:35.840
I found myself
alone in a forest,

15:35.880 --> 15:37.840
actually beating myself up.

15:37.880 --> 15:41.440
Now, if the young man
who joined the army

15:41.480 --> 15:44.240
could have seen the future,

15:44.280 --> 15:46.920
could have seen his older self
alone in that forest...

15:51.040 --> 15:53.120
he'd have been confused.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.440
Anyway...

16:04.480 --> 16:07.040
enough about me.

16:07.080 --> 16:10.160
What about you, Philo, old chum?

16:10.200 --> 16:11.880
Why did you join up?

16:27.800 --> 16:28.800
Where did you
and Mum meet?

16:30.040 --> 16:33.480
Over there, down by the river.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.440
She was 13 years old.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.840
I was 15.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.200
You must miss her very much.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.040
If there's one thing
life has taught me,

16:43.080 --> 16:44.360
it's get used
to losing things...

16:45.480 --> 16:46.960
anything
you cherish.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.800
Now, I've decided
something.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.960
You're a smart girl,
smarter than me.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.120
So, from now on,
you make the decisions.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.560
We can discuss everything,
and we can argue,

17:06.599 --> 17:07.599
but if it comes
down to it,

17:07.640 --> 17:09.720
and I want
to take the low road,

17:09.760 --> 17:11.680
and you think
the high road's better,

17:11.720 --> 17:13.119
then, the high road
we shall take.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.040
What if I don't agree?

17:15.079 --> 17:16.400
If I'm in charge,

17:16.440 --> 17:17.440
and I don't agree
to be in charge,

17:17.480 --> 17:18.960
then where does that leave us?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.839
Good point,

17:20.880 --> 17:22.200
and so, young lady,

17:22.240 --> 17:24.079
for the very last time,

17:24.119 --> 17:25.119
do as I say.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.680
So beheading your best mate...

17:47.360 --> 17:49.480
what set you off
down that particular road?

17:52.560 --> 17:53.600
Do you have
any regrets?

17:56.040 --> 17:58.000
Was it hard?

17:58.040 --> 17:58.840
Easy?

17:58.880 --> 18:01.280
Gruesome?
Exciting?

18:01.320 --> 18:03.120
Terrifying?

18:11.960 --> 18:13.160
Just to say,

18:13.200 --> 18:14.840
this thing about your mother
being a whore?

18:14.880 --> 18:16.200
Some of the older guys
back at camp

18:16.240 --> 18:17.200
have been there.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.160
In fact, I've been there.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.040
Me and this monkey,

18:20.080 --> 18:21.720
an actual monkey...

18:21.760 --> 18:23.400
this great big baboon.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.280
Me up one end,

18:24.320 --> 18:25.200
the baboon
up the other,

18:25.240 --> 18:27.680
at the same time.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.080
Speak to me, Philo.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.520
Please.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.200
Speak to me.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.760
Just say one fucking word.

18:35.800 --> 18:36.680
Such...

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
Yes?

18:43.920 --> 18:45.160
Such...

18:45.200 --> 18:46.920
Such what?

18:49.280 --> 18:50.280
Such...

18:50.320 --> 18:51.360
Good.
I've got the "Such."

18:51.400 --> 18:52.360
Such what?

18:52.400 --> 18:53.360
Such...

18:55.640 --> 18:56.600
Excellent.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.480
Good, but...

18:58.520 --> 19:00.720
and this is the crucial part,
Philo...

19:00.760 --> 19:01.720
such what?

19:01.760 --> 19:02.520
Such...

19:02.560 --> 19:03.440
Stay with me.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.200
Such...

19:15.120 --> 19:16.600
Well, let's not
rush things, eh?

19:18.400 --> 19:19.800
Let's take it
one step at a time.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.280
If you feel like
adding anything to that...

19:23.560 --> 19:25.400
I'm right here.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.960
Such...

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
such...

19:41.800 --> 19:43.400
Such...

19:56.960 --> 19:58.720
Such...

20:00.840 --> 20:01.760
Such...

20:23.480 --> 20:24.560
What...

20:24.600 --> 20:25.480
Shh, shh.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.880
Why are you stopping?

20:29.680 --> 20:31.320
Can you hear that?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.040
Such...

20:37.200 --> 20:39.280
Such...

20:39.320 --> 20:41.480
That there. There.
Shh, there.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.200
It's the wind.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.960
Is it?

20:49.880 --> 20:50.840
It's stopped.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.280
It has, hasn't it?

20:54.320 --> 20:56.480
This place
gives me the creeps...

20:56.520 --> 20:57.760
ever since
I was a child.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.040
Really?

20:59.080 --> 21:00.760
Why don't you tell me
all about it?

21:00.800 --> 21:02.960
Oh, do piss off.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.200
Such...

21:12.200 --> 21:14.360
Such...

21:17.240 --> 21:18.960
Such...

21:24.520 --> 21:25.480
You see a key anywhere?

21:25.520 --> 21:26.800
Such...

21:29.480 --> 21:30.360
A key, mate.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.200
Such...

21:34.720 --> 21:35.520
Such...

21:36.680 --> 21:38.800
Such...

21:38.840 --> 21:40.480
Such...

21:44.280 --> 21:45.280
What was that?

21:45.320 --> 21:46.720
A ghost,

21:46.760 --> 21:48.520
come to eat you.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.320
Philo, mate.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.640
Stop what you're doing
and come and see this.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.680
I think we're in
a witch doctor's house,

22:23.720 --> 22:25.920
and we found his stash.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.440
Seriously!

22:29.480 --> 22:32.120
You need to come
and see this.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.800
Such...

22:34.840 --> 22:36.480
horror.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.440
Feel anything yet?

24:26.480 --> 24:29.000
No, me either.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.600
See what this one does.

24:36.480 --> 24:39.640
It's been a funny few weeks,
when you think about it.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.000
Ever since we left Gaul,
I've had this feeling

24:41.040 --> 24:43.720
that we're heading towards
some sort of catastrophe.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.440
I've never had that before,

24:45.480 --> 24:47.360
but I just keep
feeling all the time that...

24:59.040 --> 25:00.080
Whoa.

25:05.560 --> 25:06.520
Whoa.

25:11.560 --> 25:12.520
Whoa...

26:36.440 --> 26:37.520
Are you
still there, mate?

26:59.440 --> 27:01.840
I'm sorry.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.040
Don't mention it.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.280
No, I mean...

27:04.320 --> 27:07.480
I'm sorry
if I've been a bit quiet.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.760
It's perfectly
all right.

27:08.800 --> 27:09.720
I've had a rough few days.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.120
Hey, it's
understandable.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.720
You've been
through it.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.960
We were with this bloke,
this Celt...

27:16.960 --> 27:19.840
and he had this pebble,
this wonderful stone.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.240
It was so smooth.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.320
Smooth?

27:22.360 --> 27:24.160
When you looked at it,

27:24.200 --> 27:27.160
it was like it held
all the secrets of the universe.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.920
You could see
every crevice,

27:28.960 --> 27:30.160
every tiny sparkle...

27:30.200 --> 27:34.640
a million-year-old object,
one in a billion.

27:34.680 --> 27:35.600
How are your legs?

27:38.080 --> 27:38.960
The legs feel good.

27:39.000 --> 27:39.960
And the arms?

27:40.000 --> 27:40.840
The arms
won't move.

27:40.880 --> 27:41.680
The head?

27:45.680 --> 27:46.960
I don't want
to talk about heads.

27:47.000 --> 27:47.960
Understandable.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.280
I didn't mean to bring that up.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.440
I didn't mean to do it.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.800
Mate...
forget it.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.440
These things happen.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.640
There was so much blood.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.640
Leave it.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.640
I had to saw.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.080
Just stop it.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.440
I think we should
do some more.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.040
What do you suppose this is?

28:17.080 --> 28:18.640
Give me a taste.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.120
Well, stick your tongue out.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.360
Whoa, that's a massive tongue.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.920
Something's been bothering me.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.520
I'm all ears.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.680
I've been in this legion
a while now.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.120
Been all over...

29:26.160 --> 29:29.960
Egypt, Trieste, Gaul,
now here.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.120
On my travels,
I've noticed something.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.160
Oh yeah?
What's that?

29:35.200 --> 29:37.840
All those places,
everywhere you go...

29:39.520 --> 29:41.440
the gods are different.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.160
Expand.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.160
I mean,
they have different names,

29:46.200 --> 29:47.800
different numbers
of arms, eyes, heads.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.040
Sometimes they're elephants.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.320
Sometimes nightingales...
trees... virgins...

29:51.360 --> 29:53.240
and I've been thinking,
how can that be?

29:53.280 --> 29:55.000
How can the gods over here
be different

29:55.040 --> 29:56.160
to the gods over there?

29:58.760 --> 29:59.840
You've lost me.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.440
We have gods
for everything, right?

30:01.480 --> 30:02.600
Swords.
-Vulcanus.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.760
-Shields.
-Serapis.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.760
Exactly. Helmet. Pillow.
Tinderbox. Soap.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.640
We have Pino,
god of the boot.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.080
When I put my boot on,
I say a prayer to Pino,

30:11.120 --> 30:13.000
so all day long,
the boot stays on,

30:13.040 --> 30:14.840
the leather doesn't fray,
the buckle snap.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.600
I do the same.
Every morning, every night.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.200
Exactly. So we have Pino,
god of the boot.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.120
All hail to him.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.400
The Egyptians...

30:20.440 --> 30:21.800
The Egyptians,
they didn't know who Pino was.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.560
They didn't even have a god
or goddess of the boot,

30:23.600 --> 30:24.560
but they had boots...

30:24.600 --> 30:25.920
and the Celts have boots,

30:25.960 --> 30:28.120
but I bet you
they don't know who Pino is,

30:28.160 --> 30:29.200
and...

30:29.240 --> 30:31.600
now, this is my point...

30:31.640 --> 30:34.840
why is Pino only interested
in our boots?

30:36.800 --> 30:38.920
Boots are important,
and we give thanks to Pino,

30:38.960 --> 30:39.720
and our boots don't fall apart.

30:39.760 --> 30:40.520
Brutus...

30:40.560 --> 30:41.560
So we say a prayer to him,

30:41.600 --> 30:43.640
and Pino keeps our boots
shipshape.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.480
I mean, look at them.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.080
My boots look great,

30:47.120 --> 30:49.120
and they're really comfy
right now.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.800
You're missing the point.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.040
The Egyptians have Horus,
the god of war,

30:52.080 --> 30:54.640
a falcon-headed man with
a red and white crown.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.080
We have Mars.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.760
Now, all it would take for me
to believe in Horus,

30:58.800 --> 31:00.480
to worship Horus
rather than Mars,

31:00.520 --> 31:01.880
is to be born in Egypt.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.240
If I'm born in Egypt,

31:03.280 --> 31:06.280
I instantly think
that Mars is bollocks,

31:06.320 --> 31:07.680
and even if he's not bollocks,

31:07.720 --> 31:09.600
he's nowhere near as powerful
and amazing as Horus.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.880
Don't you see?

31:11.920 --> 31:15.120
Everywhere we go,
it's different.

31:17.040 --> 31:17.920
I think I know
what you mean.

31:17.960 --> 31:18.960
Good.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.600
Now, if we think
Horus is bollocks,

31:20.640 --> 31:22.000
and they think
Mars is bollocks...

31:23.240 --> 31:25.640
maybe both are bollocks.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.760
Maybe it's all bollocks,

31:27.800 --> 31:29.680
and maybe my boot
is just my boot,

31:29.720 --> 31:30.960
and if it breaks,

31:31.000 --> 31:32.240
it's not because
I've offended Pino.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.000
It's just my boot broke,
and that's all.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.080
Of course there's Pino.
There's always been Pino.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.080
But what if
there hasn't?

31:44.120 --> 31:45.560
There's always
been Serapis.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.720
But what if
there hasn't?

31:46.760 --> 31:48.120
Stop now.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.080
Jupiter!

31:59.120 --> 32:01.520
I slayed my best friend!

32:01.560 --> 32:03.960
I took a blade and severed
his head from his body!

32:04.000 --> 32:06.600
Send a thunderbolt
and strike me dead!

32:06.640 --> 32:09.440
Do it now,
for Brutus to behold!

32:29.720 --> 32:31.560
Whoa.

32:40.880 --> 32:41.960
Do you see?

32:43.440 --> 32:45.160
I want you to stop talking.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.520
Stop talking.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.120
Don't say
another word.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.840
We are alone, Brutus.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.920
We are alone.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.680
You awake?

33:12.720 --> 33:14.640
Mm.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.360
So the fair-haired mortal
rescues the goddess

33:18.400 --> 33:20.680
and takes her
to the druids.

33:20.720 --> 33:21.680
And the goddess Brenna...

33:21.720 --> 33:24.360
Yeah, forget Brenna
for a minute.

33:24.400 --> 33:28.360
What happens
to the fair-haired mortal?

33:28.400 --> 33:29.800
Besides ruling
the heavens,

33:29.840 --> 33:31.480
the fair-haired mortal
lies with the goddess,

33:31.520 --> 33:32.840
and they have a child,

33:32.880 --> 33:34.440
and that child,
and that child's children,

33:34.480 --> 33:36.600
rule the Regni
for aeons.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.480
The Regni?

33:37.520 --> 33:38.640
Yes, the Regni.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.240
I hate the Regni.
The Regni are my enemy.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.840
You don't seem
to mind this Regni.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.440
What are you talking about?
You're a fucking nightmare.

33:43.480 --> 33:47.640
You asked for the prophecy.
That is what is written.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.560
Let's get one thing
clear.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.600
I am never having a child
with you... ever.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.640
It's a bit
late for that.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.280
What did you say?

34:15.600 --> 34:17.960
The fuck am I doing?

35:13.760 --> 35:15.320
I failed you, Cait,

35:15.360 --> 35:16.960
you and your sister.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.960
I didn't protect you.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.040
I told you to run.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.560
If I hadn't done that,
if you hadn't fled,

35:24.600 --> 35:28.200
maybe Islene would
still be alive.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.920
I miss her being here.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.000
I miss her smell,

35:33.040 --> 35:34.880
her smile,

35:34.920 --> 35:37.200
and the sound
of her voice.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.600
I don't miss my eyes.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.040
I miss her.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.040
Don't want my eyes back.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.600
I want her back.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.520
I'd give anything...
anything...

35:49.040 --> 35:50.360
We'll see her again,
Father,

35:50.400 --> 35:52.680
and when we do,

35:52.720 --> 35:55.680
we can tell her
all about our adventures.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.560
Now, get some rest.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.400
We have a long journey
in the morning.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.640
You're very
special, lass.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.640
Very special indeed.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.080
Stop it.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.000
All right, I've stopped.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.640
Is that you?

37:14.680 --> 37:17.080
I've missed you so much.

37:21.560 --> 37:24.480
I've so much
to tell you.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.040
So much has happened.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.720
I saw you die.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.760
Your love
brought me back.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.040
Come to me.
Let me hold you.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.600
You must go.

37:50.640 --> 37:53.200
But I missed you.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.680
Stop.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.560
You're not my sister.

38:00.600 --> 38:01.920
You're not Islene.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.360
Have you forgotten me so soon?

38:05.400 --> 38:08.040
How could I
forget you, Pwykka?

38:08.080 --> 38:10.520
Pwykka?

38:10.560 --> 38:12.680
Who is this Pwykka?

38:12.720 --> 38:14.240
I'm not afraid of you.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.640
Stay away from me,

38:16.680 --> 38:18.240
and stay away
from my family,

38:18.280 --> 38:19.320
or you'll regret it.

38:19.360 --> 38:20.400
Is that so?

38:20.440 --> 38:22.400
At the citadel,

38:22.440 --> 38:24.280
you were afraid
to come near me.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.680
Afraid?

38:25.720 --> 38:27.720
If you're not afraid,
then show your face.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.160
No tricks.
Just you and me.

38:32.680 --> 38:33.600
Show your face.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.360
Come and get me,
you fucking snake!

39:07.320 --> 39:08.320
Sister...

39:10.240 --> 39:12.280
Sister, it's me.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.880
Islene?
Islene!

39:15.600 --> 39:16.480
No, listen to me.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.920
Listen to me, now.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.480
Pwykka came to me.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.720
He tricked me,

39:21.760 --> 39:23.600
but you are strong.

39:23.640 --> 39:27.240
If you follow the path,
then Pwykka cannot hurt you.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.840
Nothing can.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.760
This night,

39:30.800 --> 39:33.280
the legions of the dead
are behind you.

39:33.320 --> 39:37.240
They are chanting
your name, sister.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.800
You are The One.

39:38.840 --> 39:42.800
Only you can guide us
into the light.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.280
They are singing your name,
sister.

39:46.320 --> 39:49.480
The dead
are singing your name.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.400
What is my name?

39:53.920 --> 39:56.160
Cait? Who's there?
Who is it? Who's there?

40:21.280 --> 40:22.640
Pwykka's gone.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.360
How did he find us?

40:33.400 --> 40:34.840
I need to speak
to him alone.

40:34.880 --> 40:35.640
No.

40:35.680 --> 40:36.560
Please, Dad.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.040
No, no.
I don't trust him.

40:38.080 --> 40:39.280
What about
our agreement?

40:39.320 --> 40:40.520
I've changed my mind.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.440
All right.
You're the boss.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.400
Thirsty?

41:05.560 --> 41:06.560
No.

41:14.280 --> 41:15.720
Obviously, this changes things.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.360
I went to the
Underworld.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.000
And?

41:27.040 --> 41:28.920
It seems I was...

41:30.320 --> 41:31.720
it seems
I was wrr...

41:33.840 --> 41:35.160
it seems I was wrr... rrr...

41:38.760 --> 41:41.440
It seems I was
wro... wroff...

41:42.800 --> 41:44.040
I was wrr...

41:44.080 --> 41:45.880
You were...

41:45.920 --> 41:48.720
wrrrong?

41:48.760 --> 41:50.000
Just shut your mouth,
all right?

41:50.040 --> 41:51.280
This is bad
enough as it is.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.320
It turns out

41:52.360 --> 41:54.960
you're not
a pointless, annoying,

41:55.000 --> 41:56.480
interfering little
pain in the ass.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.560
Thank you.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.760
Bad news is...

42:01.800 --> 42:03.680
I think I know
why the Romans came.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.680
I know why
they're here.

42:07.960 --> 42:11.240
Lokka, the Great Earth Demon,

42:11.280 --> 42:14.280
has come to destroy you,

42:14.320 --> 42:16.560
and...

42:16.600 --> 42:17.920
it is my...

42:21.160 --> 42:23.840
It is my mission
to protect you.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.440
Together,

42:30.480 --> 42:34.240
we must destroy Lokka.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.200
Together?

42:39.040 --> 42:40.400
You must destroy Lokka,

42:40.440 --> 42:43.560
but I will be,
you know...

42:43.600 --> 42:45.440
helping.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.440
"Thank you, Divis.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.960
I can't believe you're
doing this for me."

42:56.000 --> 42:57.160
"Don't mention it,
don't mention it.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.840
Really, honestly...
I'm happy to be here.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.040
Just happy to be on board,
really.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.400
Great."

43:07.400 --> 43:10.400
Tell me about this Lokka.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.760
What were we just
talking about?

43:24.400 --> 43:26.440
What?

43:26.480 --> 43:29.120
I was saying something...

43:29.160 --> 43:31.000
something important.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.840
Can't remember.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.000
Something about boots.

43:37.640 --> 43:39.400
That's it.
Boots.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.640
It's gone.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.160
Listen to that.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.080
Nice.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.360
Look at those stars.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.040
So many.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.480
And the moon.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.000
So bright.

44:08.400 --> 44:11.120
All hail Luna.

44:11.160 --> 44:14.040
All hail Luna.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.920
May she watch over us always.
