[cooing]

01:01.687 --> 01:03.897
[bird squawks, screams]

01:05.774 --> 01:10.028
I call you forth! Argante. Lady Pale.

01:10.529 --> 01:13.782
Baba Yaga. Eldritch Queen.

01:15.659 --> 01:19.246
[female voice] I have many names.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.253
I come to trade.

01:26.336 --> 01:30.257
Gunmar's war for the surface lands
has ravaged my village.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.718
I need the power to protect my people.

01:32.801 --> 01:38.932
[female voice] You seek magic,
but what do you bring in return?

01:43.061 --> 01:44.438
[grunts]

01:44.521 --> 01:48.734
Here, my offering,
carved from my own living stone.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.747
Yes! I can... I can feel it!

02:01.830 --> 02:04.207
It is so... It is so...

02:05.834 --> 02:08.586
[groans]

02:08.669 --> 02:10.047
[roars]

02:15.218 --> 02:16.219
[growls]

02:16.303 --> 02:19.431
My soul! You lied to me!

02:19.514 --> 02:21.558
-[growls]
-[giggles]

02:21.642 --> 02:23.477
[female voice] You fool.

02:24.519 --> 02:28.273
Your flesh is worth nothing.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.359
What have you done to me?

02:30.442 --> 02:34.946
Inside, I am so... so...

02:35.030 --> 02:35.864
empty!

02:35.947 --> 02:39.201
[female voice] I gave you what you wanted.

02:39.284 --> 02:42.329
Now, your soul is mine!

02:42.412 --> 02:43.246
[voice echoes]

02:43.330 --> 02:49.586
You will seek Merlin's champions
and bring death to his Trollhunters!

-[groaning]

02:52.089 --> 02:54.216

No!

02:56.218 --> 02:58.428
[screams]

02:59.262 --> 03:00.681
[music playing]

03:35.549 --> 03:37.092
[grunts]

03:41.722 --> 03:43.807
-[grunts]
-Mm...

03:43.890 --> 03:45.559
The Trollhunter.

03:45.642 --> 03:49.688
You have returned
and without your amulet.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.523
I need the Kairosect.

03:51.606 --> 03:56.653
[laughs]
The Kairosect? Dangerous magic.

03:56.737 --> 04:02.659
After what your friends did to me,
why should I let you live?

04:02.743 --> 04:06.037
'Cause this time, <i>I </i> have a riddle for <i>you.</i>

04:06.121 --> 04:08.457
Really? A riddle?

04:08.540 --> 04:09.624
[chuckles]

04:09.708 --> 04:15.213
I am the master of riddles.
I know them all.

04:15.297 --> 04:20.177
-But you don't know this one.
-Willing to bet your life on it?

04:22.095 --> 04:27.017
What do you call cheese that isn't yours?

04:28.727 --> 04:30.395
Hmm...

04:30.479 --> 04:34.441
"What do you call cheese
that is not yours?"

04:34.524 --> 04:36.067
Hmm...

04:36.151 --> 04:38.737
I've got it! "Nacho cheese."

04:38.820 --> 04:41.281
And it's "nacho" day, either. Now!

04:41.364 --> 04:42.532
[sighs]

04:42.616 --> 04:44.534
I said, "Now!"

04:44.618 --> 04:46.661
[yelling]

04:46.745 --> 04:48.413
-Master Jim! [grunts]
-[grunts]

04:48.497 --> 04:50.874
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

04:50.957 --> 04:55.754
-A trick? [grunts]
-Come on! Come on!

04:55.837 --> 04:57.839
[mumbles incoherently]

04:57.923 --> 05:02.761
-Down the hatch!
-[groans] Not again. After them!

05:02.844 --> 05:06.348
Ahh! Ahh!

05:07.432 --> 05:10.310
I miss the simpler days of hunting gnomes.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.270
Hurry! Keep looking!

05:12.354 --> 05:15.690
-[weapons clanging]
-[screams, groans]

05:15.774 --> 05:18.485
Ha-ha! The Kairosect!
Good work, my chum!

05:18.568 --> 05:21.071
Tobias, let's evacuate! Ha-ha!

05:21.154 --> 05:22.614
Uh, poor choice of words.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.782
[weapons clanging]

05:23.865 --> 05:25.283
Hey, over here!

05:25.367 --> 05:28.745
That's right, boys. Your big boss
didn't like those tacos last time?

05:28.829 --> 05:29.913
Well, this is worse.

05:29.996 --> 05:34.251
The Mega Trinidad Scorpion Burrito
with spicy sour cream and pastrami.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.587
If I were you,
I might want to skedaddle.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.672
[grunts]

05:43.093 --> 05:44.261
[gasps]

05:46.096 --> 05:48.682
[laughs]
Uh-oh.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.977
Fire in the hole!

05:53.937 --> 05:54.938
[gasps]

05:55.021 --> 05:56.106
Not again!

05:56.189 --> 05:58.441
[panting]

05:58.525 --> 06:03.321
Ha! Looks like it's "nacho" Kairosect,
either. See ya, suckers!

06:03.405 --> 06:06.491
Well, that was almost a clean getaway.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.788
Curse you, Trollhunter!

06:13.373 --> 06:15.000
-Interesting...
-Ooh.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.543
Fascinating...

06:16.626 --> 06:17.836
Intriguing...

06:17.919 --> 06:21.339
So, how exactly does this thing
get Strickler's ring off?

06:21.423 --> 06:22.591
That is the conundrum.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.468
Perhaps someone should have stolen
the instruction manual as well.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.388
Eh, it doesn't look that com--
Whoa! Where'd Blinky go?

06:28.471 --> 06:31.766
Yes! Yes! Eureka! It works!

06:31.850 --> 06:34.436
-What? What work?
-How did you get up there?

06:34.519 --> 06:37.355
The Kairosect enables its bearer
to step outside of time,

06:37.439 --> 06:40.025
affording the opportunity to do this.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.194
-[laughs]
-[gasps] What just happened?

06:43.278 --> 06:45.155
-I feel so violated.
-[groaning]

06:45.238 --> 06:47.824
-This is amazing!
-Ow!

06:47.907 --> 06:49.075
Do you know what this means?

06:49.159 --> 06:51.953
So, that's how you get a ring off someone
without them knowing.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.748
We'd have so much time on our hands!

06:54.831 --> 06:57.459
I don't have to worry about juggling
two lives at once!

06:57.542 --> 06:59.294
I could live all the lives I want!

06:59.377 --> 07:02.672
We could travel the world in a day!
 We could get PhDs in everything!

07:02.756 --> 07:06.176
Finally learn to play the bagpipes!
Become karate masters!

07:06.259 --> 07:07.844
Dude, we'd be Renaissance men!

07:07.927 --> 07:11.723
Or you could pass Uhl's Spanish test,
unless you want to fail his class.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.184
[groans]
<i>Me olvidé. </i> I forgot!

07:14.267 --> 07:17.437
Ah! Powers of this device
are limited to three rules.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.190
According to the inscription,
if my Salickacious is correct,

07:20.273 --> 07:23.735
the first is that only one person
can step outside of time.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.903
Oh...

07:24.986 --> 07:28.740
Secondly, the time-stopping effect
lasts for precisely 43 minutes

07:28.823 --> 07:30.200
and nine seconds.

07:31.034 --> 07:34.245
-And the third?
-You can only use it, uh... three times.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.914
Well! Now, we know the rules!

07:35.997 --> 07:38.667
Wait! You just used that thing,
like, twice.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.251
Well, the first, to test its ability,

07:40.335 --> 07:42.629
and the second,
to demonstrate it to all of you.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.673
Blink, you wasted our shots!

07:44.756 --> 07:47.759
Now, we've only got one chance
to get the ring off Strickler!

07:47.842 --> 07:50.178
In that case,
I suggest you assure yourselves

07:50.261 --> 07:51.596
of his whereabouts before proceeding.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.474
And I suggest you study
for that Spanish final.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.101
[groans]

07:56.184 --> 07:58.144
[groans]

07:58.228 --> 08:00.563
There's not enough hours in the day,
is there, kiddo?

08:00.647 --> 08:03.900
Thanks, Mom.
Sorry, I'm cramming for a Spanish exam.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.653
I was thinking about reaching out
to your guidance counselor.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.280
-He left so abruptly.
-Uh-huh.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.116
All right. Night, kiddo.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.244
Try to fit some sleep
into your busy schedule, okay?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.328
Sure, Mom.

08:15.412 --> 08:18.039
-[groans]
-[door closes]

08:18.123 --> 08:21.042
-[indistinct chatter in distance]
-[snoring]

08:21.126 --> 08:23.670
-Guillermo, no... no...
-[robotic voice] <i>I am Gun Robot.</i>

08:23.753 --> 08:24.754
-[object clattering]
<i>-I am--</i>

08:24.838 --> 08:27.632
-What? What? It's four in the morning.
-[Toby] <i>Jim! Where are you?</i>

08:27.716 --> 08:30.385
Sleeping. Why are you calling me
in the middle of the night?

08:30.468 --> 08:31.678
<i>Jim, it's 8:30!</i>

08:31.761 --> 08:34.097
[screams, gasps]

08:34.681 --> 08:35.807
I slept through my alarm!

08:35.890 --> 08:38.893
They're gonna carve that
on your tombstone, Jimbo. The test?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.770
[gasps, grunts]

08:40.854 --> 08:43.023
So late! So late!

08:47.944 --> 08:48.987
[gasps, chuckles]

08:49.070 --> 08:52.032
<i>Usted es un hombre muerto, mi amigo.</i>

08:55.076 --> 08:57.662
[grunts, pants]

08:58.663 --> 09:00.623
-Dude!
-I overslept!

09:04.753 --> 09:05.587
[chuckles]

09:06.838 --> 09:10.967
-[clock ticking]
-Hmm...

09:11.968 --> 09:12.886
[sighs]

09:14.220 --> 09:15.305
-[watch beeping]
-[gasps]

09:15.388 --> 09:19.684
[chuckles]
You are out of time, <i>amigo. </i> Pencils down.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.021
-That was dumb.
-[sighs]

09:23.104 --> 09:24.439
That sucked big-time.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.069
Come on, think positive! You never know,
you might have aced the thing.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.196
I didn't get past the first page.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.074
But maybe you impressed him so much
on that first page

09:34.157 --> 09:35.408
'cause you've got good handwriting?

09:35.492 --> 09:37.077
No, yeah. You're going to summer school.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.912
You're definitely going to summer school.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.790
-What am I gonna do, Tobes?
-[Claire] We got a problem!

09:41.873 --> 09:43.333
-Oh, great. Now, what?
-[school bell rings]

09:43.416 --> 09:44.417
I was thinking last night.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.836
Say you go through with the trade
and Angor's free.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.713
-How can we trust him?
-What do you mean?

09:48.797 --> 09:51.925
He kills Trollhunters.
I don't think he's looking to retire.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.177
But I thought if he doesn't
get the ring back to Angor,

09:54.260 --> 09:56.721
-he's dead meat.
<i>-I am Gun Robot--</i>

09:56.805 --> 09:59.099
So, what?
We don't go through with the deal?

09:59.182 --> 10:03.019
-Hello?
-[Bagdwella] <i>An infestation!</i>

10:03.103 --> 10:06.064
Bagdwella? How did you get my number?

10:06.147 --> 10:09.651
Infestation of gnomes in my shop!

10:09.734 --> 10:12.904
I need the Trollhunter!
[gasps]

10:12.987 --> 10:14.948
-[smooching]
-[screams]

10:15.031 --> 10:17.283
I got it! What if <i>you</i>
take the ring and wear it?

10:17.367 --> 10:20.411
You're talking about betraying
a troll assassin.

10:20.495 --> 10:24.124
No. We're talking about controlling
a troll assassin.

10:24.207 --> 10:28.670
Not assassins, dear!
Gnomes! They're revolting!

10:28.753 --> 10:33.800
-I know, gnomes are disgusting.
-No, the other kind of revolting, dear!

10:33.883 --> 10:36.761
They've organized to tear apart my shop!

10:36.845 --> 10:38.805
-So, what are you gonna do?
-Uh...

10:38.888 --> 10:43.143
Spring Fling challenge in one hour,
butt-munch. Textbook stacking.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.645
As my books go up, you go down.

10:45.728 --> 10:49.232
<i>-The Trollhunter cannot refuse the call.</i>
-I can't!

10:49.315 --> 10:52.110
What do you mean, you can't? You either
wear the ring or make the trade.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.655
-I can't stack gnomes!
-Not stacking! Catching!

10:55.738 --> 10:57.323
Poof! Last challenge, Lake!

10:57.407 --> 10:59.033
-Just get the ring--
-No, you have to trade--

10:59.117 --> 11:01.870
-[screams] I'm losing my mind!
-[school bell rings]

11:01.953 --> 11:03.288
[grunts]

11:03.371 --> 11:04.581
[screaming]

11:04.664 --> 11:06.166
-What a freak.
-[sighs]

11:06.249 --> 11:07.959
We could've been Renaissance men.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.503
-[Blinky groans]
-Mm.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.631
-A thousand apologies.
-Oh, please, don't apologize.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.300
I really appreciate you taking the time.

11:15.383 --> 11:19.053
[sneezes] This time, I promise,
you have my undivided attention.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.265
So, about Master Jim--
I mean Jim, your son.

11:22.348 --> 11:27.395
Well, in a way, things have gotten worse,
and I didn't even think that was possible.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.356
-[takes deep breath] Tell me.
-I mean, he just seems so...

11:31.441 --> 11:32.442
preoccupied.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.735
It's almost like

11:33.818 --> 11:36.779
he has this entire secret life
that I don't know anything about.

11:36.863 --> 11:40.575
-[gasps, screams]
-Wait. Oh, my gosh. What is that?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.785
-Mosquito.
-Okay.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.663
I know that teenagers go through
all manner of changes,

11:45.747 --> 11:48.249
but what bothers me is that Jim and I
have always been close.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.544
I mean, I didn't think that we would ever
keep secrets from each other.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.588
[gasps]
Uh...

11:53.671 --> 11:56.007
-Are you okay?
-[chuckles nervously]

11:56.090 --> 11:58.718
I-I truly doubt he's keeping
anything secret from you.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.054
Yeah, what-- what do you think
is going on with him?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.472
Ooh, let me...

12:02.555 --> 12:04.057
[grunts, yelps]

12:04.140 --> 12:05.350
Growing pains?

12:05.433 --> 12:10.355
Oh, um, well, it's been more than that.

12:10.438 --> 12:14.067
He's been defiant.
Jim has always been such a good boy.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.736
Well, perhaps the issue
is that he's no longer a man--

12:16.819 --> 12:18.947
I mean, becoming a troll!
[screams]

12:19.030 --> 12:21.366
[gasps]
A man! Uh...

12:21.449 --> 12:23.993
[chuckles]
My, what a large salad selection.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.121
[chuckles]
Are you sure you're all right?

12:27.205 --> 12:28.623
I've never felt better.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.167

Mr. Blinky, your skin...

12:33.711 --> 12:35.129
You're turning blue.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.883
Now, I don't want to alarm you,
but I think you're having a heart attack.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.301
[chuckles, groans]

12:40.385 --> 12:42.428
And are you smoking?

12:42.512 --> 12:44.806
A filthy habit. I really must quit.
Excuse me.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.976
I-I must use the facilities.
I'll just be a moment.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.560

12:49.644 --> 12:51.938

You don't sound so good.

-Whoa! [coughs]
-[groaning]

13:03.157 --> 13:05.243
-Ew! That's not normal.
-[grunts]

13:05.326 --> 13:08.413
Sounds like you need a doctor, buddy.
Yo, is there a doctor here?

13:08.496 --> 13:09.831
-[screams] Ow!
-Someone sounds like

13:09.914 --> 13:12.000
-they are in a world of pain.
-Oh, dear.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.836
I'm a doctor.
Mr. Blinky, are you okay in there?

13:14.919 --> 13:16.713
[whispering]
Of all the worst possible times.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.673
I'm fine! Really, nothing to see here.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.758
Please, unlock the door. I can help you.

figure out what book stacking is,
so I can win Spring Fling!

13:29.392 --> 13:30.560
Then I can be your duke.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.937
And find the right moment
to take Strickler's ring off.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.648
When you get the ring, you're not gonna
give it back to Angor, right?

13:35.732 --> 13:36.816
You can control him.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.402
If he doesn't get the ring
back to Angor, he's wasted.

I'm reverting to troll form!

13:45.324 --> 13:47.368
That's great! Isn't that what you wanted?

13:47.452 --> 13:50.913
Yes, but not in a public toilet where
your mother is beating down the door!

I'm a doctor, and I need you
to open the door. Okay?

13:57.712 --> 13:58.755
What? How?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.924
Those questions aren't the most pertinent
at the moment. The real quandary is--

14:02.008 --> 14:04.469
Could someone please help me
open this door?

14:04.552 --> 14:05.970
How fast can you get here?

14:06.054 --> 14:08.139
Stay put.
We'll be there as soon as we can.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.892
Blinky's stuck in Arcadia
and he's turning into a troll.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.436
