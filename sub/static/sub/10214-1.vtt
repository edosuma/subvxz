00:11.000 --> 00:12.300
Bad!

00:14.600 --> 00:16.200
Look at you, Bud!
- I can see the mountains!

00:20.100 --> 00:21.900
I haven't felt like this ever!

00:23.600 --> 00:24.900
This is insane! (?)

00:40.800 --> 00:42.700
What a ride! Come here!

00:44.800 --> 00:48.500
Wow! Was that fun?
- My God!

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
You gotta go up there,
it's like another world!

00:51.800 --> 00:53.400
Kiss me.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.000
Take that. Nasty gale. (?)

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Pretty darn intense.

01:01.300 --> 01:05.200
Is it always like that?
- What are you talking about?

01:06.500 --> 01:11.200
You've been married a lot.
- Yeah, but I, you know, I didn't ...

01:15.800 --> 01:18.100
I've got a 28-year-old son, Jeanie.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.100
I haven't seen him since he was four.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.300
Where is he?
- I dunno.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.200
His mother, Mary Jo,
lives in Marfa, Texas.

01:33.900 --> 01:38.100
I do not know what he looks like,
or what he does.

01:40.300 --> 01:44.800
I never taught him to ride a bike
or watch him play baseball. None of that.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.000
Why not?
- I dunno.

01:50.700 --> 01:54.400
I wasn't there,
even when I was.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.500
I couldn't live
if I lost Buddy.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.900
That's the damndest part. I did.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.600
I wanna get away
by ourselves this weekend.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.500
What day is it today?
- Thursday.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.100
I'm not coming back to this city. (?)
- In a while. (?)

02:28.100 --> 02:29.900
Come here now.
Come here!

02:29.900 --> 02:31.400
Don't rip the pretty dress.
Come here!

02:55.300 --> 02:57.600
I gotta go, I gotta go.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.600
I love you.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.200
Where are you going? (?)

03:33.400 --> 03:34.900
I gotta get to the paper.

03:36.600 --> 03:40.300
I'll drop Buddy off at daycare
and call you at about three.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.900
Let him stay here with me.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.200
You don't wanna babysit.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.400
What do you mean?
- Buddy, you wanna see you friends, right?

03:51.100 --> 03:53.300
Come on,
we want to stay here, Mom.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.900
Yes, we want to stay here.
- We do?

03:57.300 --> 03:58.600
Please.
- And do what?

03:59.200 --> 04:01.200
Man stuff.
- Yeah, man stuff.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.100
How will you do that with your ankle?

04:04.400 --> 04:05.900
Come on,
it'll be good for us.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.600
Please, Mom.
- We'll be fine, I promise.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.600
All right.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.400
His lunch box is over there.
I'll get his car seat.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.300
Here, take this.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.200
Can you pick me up some cream of tartar?
I need it for my biscuits.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.400
Some what?
- Cream of tartar.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.700
Do you play cards?
- Yeah.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.400
What do you play?
- Just regular, like (???).

04:32.900 --> 04:34.000
Hey.
- What?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.500
You know what we oughtta do?

04:36.400 --> 04:39.500
We oughtta go and see if we can find
some trouble to get into.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.600
Yeah, big trouble.
- Be kinda fun.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.700
Let's see what's in your box.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.900
There you go!

04:55.400 --> 04:57.600
Put your head back. I got you!

05:02.100 --> 05:03.700
I got you!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.800
Hey, be careful up there,
don't fall down!

05:28.200 --> 05:29.400
Hey, Bud.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.700
I've brought you something.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.500
Bud?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.200
Buddy?

05:47.900 --> 05:49.700
Oh my God.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.100
My god, you scared me.
What time is it?

05:53.200 --> 05:56.300
We had fun. Nobody died.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.100
You taste like chocolate.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.000
Look what I've brought you.

06:24.300 --> 06:28.200
You're my roadie and groupie
all rolled into one.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.300
Set those down there.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.900
Look at that paint job, huh?
That's rust - metal flake rust.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.400
I want you to come to Houston.
Would you do that?

06:44.200 --> 06:45.300
Throw those in there.

06:46.100 --> 06:50.400
I'll be there for four months.
Nights only, so I got my days off.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.800
I took time off for your visit, so
I don't know if I can.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.800
You can take Buddy. There's all kinds of
great stuff for kids...

06:57.000 --> 07:00.500
All right, we'll see.
- that aquarium with a big fountain.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.100
All right, we'll see.

07:03.900 --> 07:07.600
"We'll see." That means no.
- No, it means "we'll see".

07:09.600 --> 07:10.800
All right?

07:12.100 --> 07:14.300
Lotta good stuff to write about in Houston.

07:16.800 --> 07:21.400
And there's me.
- That's more than a visit.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.300
A lot of the good stuff, too.
- Jesus.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.100
I don't wanna hear it, darlin'.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.900
I don't want it around Buddy,
that much I know.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.700
I heard you the first time.
- It's like living with a rattlesnake.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.400
Wait.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.900
I can't see you.

08:54.900 --> 08:55.900
Ayúdame, amigo. Basura, basura.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.900
Ayúdame, vamos a limpiar, okay?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.700
Then I'll teach you some words of English.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.900
Hey, hey!
- Hey.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.500
What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you.

09:10.900 --> 09:15.500
Jesus, Bad. You look like shit, man.
- Yeah, I know...

09:16.100 --> 09:19.500
it's all the toilets I have to play in.
- Yeah?

09:22.700 --> 09:23.500
Good to see you.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.500
Sorry about the wreck,
I heard about that.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.900
Could've been worse.
- Yeah.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.200
How's business?
- Business? What business?

09:38.100 --> 09:42.600
Since you've been on the road, I tell you ...

09:43.000 --> 09:47.800
it's crap.
- Yeah, well if you cleaned this joint ...

09:48.300 --> 09:50.900
maybe you'd figure out how to
get this business running.

09:51.100 --> 09:54.300
If I cleaned it up I might find
out that we're both broke.

09:55.400 --> 09:59.000
I had to git rid of my bartender.
It's just me and old Jesus.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.100
Shit.
- Yeah, just us.

10:01.700 --> 10:05.700
So? How's the road?
- Not getting any shorter.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.700
Makes coming back here look good.

10:08.200 --> 10:12.200
I have a feeling, knowing you, that
something happened. Special.

10:13.600 --> 10:19.700
Yeah, I met a woman in Santa Fe.
- Yeah? Doesn't surprise me.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.000
She's a good one, real good.
- Yeah?

10:23.800 --> 10:26.100
More? No, not any more.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.800
That's it.
- Oh, you sumbitch.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.000
So. Santa Fe's a long way from here, right?

10:31.100 --> 10:32.700
879 miles.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.600
It's a tough trip for a man who
has to work Saturday nights, right?

10:37.800 --> 10:39.100
Yeah.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.500
Yeah, but worth it.
- We'll get you back in shape singing.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.300
I want you to meet somebody.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.500
Oiga, Jesus. Come here.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.800
I want you to meet a legend. Big Bad.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.900
Hi there, what's your name?
- Juan.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.500
Yeah, Juan.
- Juan.

10:52.800 --> 10:53.800
Or Jesus. Whatever.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.400
A good man.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
<i> Hello.</i>

11:54.700 --> 11:55.600
Hi.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.300
Is this Steven Reynolds?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.100
<i> Yeah, who's calling?</i>

12:02.200 --> 12:05.700
Actually I'm on a bit of a hunting trip....

12:05.900 --> 12:07.900
I'm trying to track down a Mary Jo Reynolds.

12:09.100 --> 12:13.800
She lived in Nashville from 1980 to 1985.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.600
Born in Lima, Ohio.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.900
You wouldn't be related, would you?

12:20.900 --> 12:22.100
<i>She was my mother.</i>

12:24.800 --> 12:27.400
<i> Hey buddy, I can't hear you.
Who is this?</i>

12:28.800 --> 12:30.100
Your father.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.100
<i> Who?</i>

12:33.900 --> 12:35.700
I'm Bad Blake.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.900
I'm here in Houston.
I'm your father.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.900
How are you?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.100
<i> What do you want?</i>

12:48.700 --> 12:50.700
I'm kinda shocked
to hear your voice.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.400
You said "was".

12:56.800 --> 12:58.500
Mary Jo's dead?

12:58.800 --> 13:01.200
<i>Two years, come October.</i>

13:03.400 --> 13:04.800
What happened?

13:04.800 --> 13:05.800
<i>Everything.</i>

13:08.200 --> 13:09.600
I'm sorry, Steven.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
<i> Yeah. Well listen, what do you want?</i>

13:14.000 --> 13:15.500
I want to see you.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.500
<i> I don't think so.</i>

13:21.700 --> 13:23.300
Will you think about it?

13:23.300 --> 13:27.100
<i> I'm sorry sir, I probably
won't be able to help you.</i>

13:27.100 --> 13:30.200
Wanna take down my number?

13:30.400 --> 13:31.900
<i> I got your number.</i>

13:36.500 --> 13:37.900
Well ...

13:39.500 --> 13:42.000
Sleep on it, think about it, and ...

13:44.100 --> 13:45.900
I really would like to talk.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.800
<i> Imagine that.</i>

14:49.600 --> 14:52.400
<i> I made the cars go real fast.</i>

14:52.800 --> 14:55.400
<i>And when the collide they go boom! (?)</i>

14:55.400 --> 14:57.500
Oh, you got the cars, huh?

14:57.900 --> 15:00.300
I can make them go faster than
anybody, then they crash!

15:00.500 --> 15:04.800
What he's trying to say is "thank you".

15:05.000 --> 15:09.300
<i> But you gotta stop sending him things.
He thinks you're Santa Claus.</i>

15:09.500 --> 15:11.000
<i> I do think he's Santa Claus.</i>

15:11.100 --> 15:13.800
I want him to know I'm
thinking about him, darling.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.500
Are you thinking about me?

15:15.500 --> 15:17.200
<i> Yes I am.</i>

15:19.100 --> 15:20.300
<i> Are you all right?</i>

15:21.000 --> 15:23.200
I called my son last night, Jeanie.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.300
And?

15:28.500 --> 15:29.800
He wouldn't talk to me.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.800
<i> Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

15:33.700 --> 15:35.300
I don't blame him.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.900
Jeanie ...

15:42.100 --> 15:44.500
I'm not feeling well.
I'll have to call you back.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.100
Bad?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.800
Big Bad, where are you, boy?

16:19.300 --> 16:21.200
No, not again.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.100
We're going fishing, all right?

16:28.100 --> 16:32.800
Let's go. You forget? Let's go.
Get dressed, I'm waiting on you.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.100
Toss me another one of those
barley pops, would you?

16:46.900 --> 16:48.500
Here you go.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.500
I hate to admit it, but
this was a damn good idea.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.700
I just sent what might be
my best song ever to Tommy.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.099
To record?
- Yes.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.700
It's one of those you hate to give up.
- Why'd you do it?

17:10.200 --> 17:12.599
He's paying me awful good.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.900
He's in LA now, recording it.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.400
Well I hope he don't fuck it up.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.300
He can't fuck it up. It's that good.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.800
So your boy won't talk to you?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.600
No..

17:32.600 --> 17:36.100
I don't blame him. I was wrong.
I had no right to call him.

17:36.600 --> 17:40.700
Wait. You were wrong 25 years ago,
and wrong since, but ...

17:40.800 --> 17:42.600
you called him. Now you're not wrong.

17:43.300 --> 17:47.300
You're right, he's wrong.
- I went 25 years without trying to find him.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.000
He's right. Too little, too late.
- No.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.300
It's never too late son, never too late.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.800
You called him, it's done.
All right? It's complete.

17:55.800 --> 18:01.800
Now you're on the right track.
Just keep going. He's your son.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.600
He is all I got.
- Keep after him.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.700
It's what you gotta do.

18:10.100 --> 18:14.300
It reminds me of a song by Billy Joe Shaver.

18:15.100 --> 18:18.400
"I'm gonna live forever. Gonna cross that river.
Gonna catch tomorrow now ."

18:20.700 --> 18:27.100
Goes something like:
"Nobody here will ever find me...

18:27.100 --> 18:32.100
but I'll always be around. Just like
the songs I leave behind me...

18:32.100 --> 18:35.100
I'm going to live forever now."

18:35.600 --> 18:36.600
And listen to this, now:

18:36.600 --> 18:39.600
"You fathers and mothers,
be good to one another...

18:39.600 --> 18:42.600
please try to raise your children right.
Don't let the darkness take them...

18:42.600 --> 18:47.600
Don't make them feel forsaken, just
lead them safely to the light."

18:56.600 --> 18:58.200
Hello.
- Hi.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.400
Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine. Why?

19:02.800 --> 19:06.800
You didn't sound all right yesterday.
Sounded like you were dying.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.700
Must've been food poisoning or something.

19:12.300 --> 19:16.500
Well I'm calling because I got 4 days off
at the end of this month...

19:17.200 --> 19:18.600
<i> And I thought we might come.</i>

19:19.300 --> 19:22.600
<i> But now I'm not sure it's such a good idea.</i>

19:23.200 --> 19:26.100
What do you mean? It's a great idea.
Why would you say that?

19:27.100 --> 19:27.800
Are you sure you're OK?

19:29.100 --> 19:30.700
<i> I'm worried about you.</i>

19:30.700 --> 19:33.700
Don't waste a minute
worrying about me.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.700
There's nothing wrong a visit won't cure.
How's Buddy?

19:37.700 --> 19:39.000
He's fine.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.100
So? You gonna come?

19:57.400 --> 20:01.200
Hey there - oh, you've got you car!

20:08.700 --> 20:10.200
I think he's had it.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.500
All right, Bud?
- He's eating in his sleep!

20:36.800 --> 20:39.000
What do you think of these
big buildings, Bud?

20:39.500 --> 20:41.900
Even Superman couldn't leap over these.

20:43.300 --> 20:49.900
Right here is where Sam Houston and his boys
beat Santa Anna and his Mexicans.

20:51.200 --> 20:56.200
If it wasn't for this spot,
we'd all be speaking Mexican.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.200
That's where Texas got its start, right there.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.600
Do you speak any Mexican, Buddy?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
"Agua" and "adios."

21:03.800 --> 21:05.000
That's pretty good!

21:08.100 --> 21:09.800
Wow, Bud, what do you see there?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Where did he go?

21:13.300 --> 21:15.800
I think there's a watch for that one there. (?)

21:16.900 --> 21:22.500
Are you getting tired?
- He's got so much energy he wears me out.

21:22.900 --> 21:27.600
Why not go back to that park and take a
load off? Let Bud and I fool around...

21:28.000 --> 21:29.900
and we'll come back around noon
and take you out to lunch.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.400
All right.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.000
Okay, you have your wish in your head?

21:36.600 --> 21:38.700
'Cos here's the spot.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.600
Here.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.600
Pick one. Pick some, you
can have a bunch.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.500
There you go, that's good.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.400
Here's mine.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.700
Can't see it.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.500
Hey Bud, wanna go inside where it's cool?

22:03.600 --> 22:05.400
Let's do that.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.500
Come on.

22:11.900 --> 22:16.800
Let's go in this place and wet our whistles
before we pop outta the ground.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.800
Out of the ground? Like that guy on TV?
- What guy?

22:21.900 --> 22:25.200
The one on TV
- Yeah, that guy. Come on.

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
Hi there.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.900
How are you guys today?
- All right.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.700
Take a load off there, Bud.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I'll take a McCure's, if you got it...

22:40.600 --> 22:42.300
Make it a double.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.300
Ginger ale for my pal here.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.700
Also a double.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.700
Mine on the rocks, please.
How about you?

22:49.300 --> 22:50.400
Rocks.

22:53.300 --> 22:56.600
Lookie here. Look at this.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.500
You wanna go explore?
You can.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.400
What did you get?

23:16.300 --> 23:19.900
Wow, Bud, you're getting
all kinds of good stuff.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.300
That's $12.50 altogether.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.500
$12.50?

23:28.600 --> 23:29.900
Jesus!

23:36.900 --> 23:39.000
Does this music drive you crazy?

23:39.900 --> 23:42.500
If I heard it, it probably would.

23:43.100 --> 23:45.300
Bud, come on and get your ginger ale.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.800
Buddy?

23:55.700 --> 23:57.400
He's probably in the restroom.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.200
Buddy!

24:06.100 --> 24:07.400
Come on, Bud.

24:19.300 --> 24:21.600
Did he come back out here?
- No.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.600
Buddy!

24:26.800 --> 24:28.200
What the hell?

24:44.600 --> 24:46.900
Did you see a little boy come in here?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.600
Bud?

24:57.100 --> 24:57.900
No..

25:16.100 --> 25:17.600
I lost my little boy.

25:18.800 --> 25:22.200
He's got brown hair. Four years old
His name's Buddy.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.800
Buddy? What was he wearing?

25:26.800 --> 25:28.600
I don't remember.
- Okay, well, sir...

25:28.900 --> 25:31.900
where did you last see him?
- In a bar.

25:32.900 --> 25:35.500
A bar. Which bar, sir?
- Hell, I don't know.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.500
It was a little dark bar.
- Okay.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.000
All stations, we've got a lost boy...

25:41.100 --> 25:43.000
four years old, brown hair. Name's Buddy.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.000
Report back, please.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.400
Thank you.
- Why don't you stay here with me?

25:49.400 --> 25:51.400
No, I gotta go find him. He's lost...

25:51.800 --> 25:53.700
he's from New Mexico. We're supposed
to be meeting his mother.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
I understand you want to find him,
but I need you to stay here.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.200
All the guys are looking for him.
All right, sir?

25:59.900 --> 26:01.900
Sir, how much have you had to drink today?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.800
I had a drink.
- A drink.

26:05.900 --> 26:09.300
What difference does that make?
- You lost him, sir.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.800
Yeah, I lost him.
I'm gonna go find him.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.900
Bud!

26:24.800 --> 26:26.600
Have you seen a little boy?

26:43.700 --> 26:45.400
What's going on?
- They're gonna find him, hon.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.100
Where's Buddy?
- They got all these guards looking for him.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.200
What?
- No need to worry.

26:50.500 --> 26:54.600
The guards are looking for him?
- I stopped just for a second.

26:54.700 --> 26:55.700
You stopped for a drink?

26:58.100 --> 26:59.800
Please don't touch me. Please
don't touch me. Excuse me...

27:00.200 --> 27:03.700
hi, I'm the momma
of the boy who's lost.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.600
I said, do not touch me!

27:20.600 --> 27:23.100
Bud, come here baby.
-There's my Buddy boy.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.500
You're gonna be fine. There's my Buddy boy.
Everything's gonna be fine.

27:28.900 --> 27:29.600
Shut up.
- We just got our wires crossed.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.900
You can't go now, you don't have a ticket.

27:39.800 --> 27:46.500
I should've trusted my instincts. Every bone in my body
told me not to get on that plane.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.500
Everything's gonna be okay, Jeanie.
- No.

27:49.900 --> 27:56.200
Everything's not okay. He's four years old.
He's scared out of his wits.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.800
I wouldn't do anything to hurt him.
- But you did!

27:59.200 --> 28:02.000
Just like every other man in my life.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.800
Just nothing but self-involved assholes!

28:06.200 --> 28:08.700
Come on, now. Just calm down.

28:09.700 --> 28:10.700
Let me...

28:11.700 --> 28:13.700
Can I have his backpack?
- Jamie...

28:14.900 --> 28:17.700
Can't we talk about it?
- Don't you touch me!

28:18.100 --> 28:19.300
It's too fucking hard! Stop!

28:24.200 --> 28:26.400
Let me drive you to the airport.
- Sorry, Bud.

28:26.700 --> 28:29.000
Let me drive you, at least. Come on.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.900
Come on, babe. I'm sorry, sweetheart.

28:33.300 --> 28:34.800
Let me take that.
- Thank you.

28:35.100 --> 28:36.900
All right, you get your seatbelt on.

28:42.900 --> 28:43.900
Jean.

28:50.900 --> 28:51.900
Jeanie!

30:23.100 --> 30:24.400
Hello.
- Wayne?

30:25.000 --> 30:28.100
Bad?
- I want to get sober.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.200
I'm Bad.

30:56.900 --> 30:59.800
I'm an alcoholic.
- Hi, Bad.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.700
A couple of days ago
I lost a little boy.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.600
I was drunk.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.200
Been drunk most of my life.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.100
I've lost a hell of a lot.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.400
I heard you're an entertainer.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.700
I am.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.500
I'm glad you're here.
We know what a hard step it is.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.400
Look who's here.

32:30.100 --> 32:33.000
Hey, good to see you!

32:34.100 --> 32:37.400
Good to see you! How do you feel?
- I feel great.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.700
Really?
- Oh, man.

32:38.900 --> 32:43.400
Take it from someone who's been there. It don't
last necessarily. It's gonna get rough.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.200
And you'll feel worthless, maybe...

32:47.300 --> 32:48.900
but I'm gonna help you with it.
- Pleased to hear you tell me that.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.100
Grab that, old buddy, I'm gonna help you.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.900
Let's put this in there.
- Yeah.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.900
I think I've got this thing licked.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.600
Let's hope so.

32:59.800 --> 33:02.600
One day at a time, all right?
- Yeah, I heard that.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.800
Get your butt in the truck. Let's go.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.100
We'll see.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.000
Thank you.

35:06.300 --> 35:10.100
Thanks for coming out.
It's so good to be home.

35:47.900 --> 35:51.000
What are you doing here?
- Listen to me.

35:51.700 --> 35:53.500
I'm sorry.

35:54.700 --> 35:57.000
Sorry with all my heart.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.900
I'm sober.
Detox, the whole bit.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.800
It woke me up.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.500
That's good, Bad.
- I'm not Bad.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.700
I'm going back to Otis,
my given name.

36:16.400 --> 36:20.300
No more Bad.
I've changed everything.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.500
That's good.

36:26.900 --> 36:30.800
How's Buddy?
- Sleeping.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.600
He's all right.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.400
Will you ever forgive me?

36:44.700 --> 36:48.500
God, I knew what the risks were with you...

36:50.600 --> 36:55.900
and I took them because...

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
I love you, and...

37:06.700 --> 37:09.500
putting Buddy in your hands...

37:09.700 --> 37:12.500
I don't know if I'll ever be able
to get over that.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.500
I'm different now.
- I am, too.

37:18.700 --> 37:19.800
Let me prove it.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.500
You're not listening to me.
- We can start over.

37:21.600 --> 37:25.500
Listen to me. I am so... I am truly
happy for you...

37:25.800 --> 37:31.200
I hope you make a really nice
life for yourself...

37:32.800 --> 37:35.500
but Buddy and I can't be a part of it.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.900
But I love both of you so much.

37:39.100 --> 37:41.500
If that's true you'll
leave us alone, all right?

37:42.100 --> 37:44.100
Come on, Jean, don't say that.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.600
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

40:32.200 --> 40:34.400
Y'all waiting to hear a song?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.500
How are you holding up?
Good.

40:40.700 --> 40:47.100
This song was written by my
mentor - more a friend.

40:48.400 --> 40:53.700
And well... it kinda speaks for itself.
I sure do hope y'all like it.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.000
That's one hell of a song.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.200
Which reminds me....

41:50.800 --> 41:54.200
They're getting bigger by the day, kid.
- Yeah, I'll say.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.600
See you later Jack.
- Hey Bad...

41:58.600 --> 41:59.900
that was a great show.

42:00.700 --> 42:03.700
And you're doing real good.
Keep it up, I'm proud of you.

42:03.900 --> 42:07.500
Still a little gas left in the tank.
See you now.

42:34.700 --> 42:36.100
Mr. Blake.

42:45.300 --> 42:46.300
Hi.

42:51.300 --> 42:53.400
You were in vintage form today.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.500
Vintage. That's about right.

42:56.700 --> 43:02.400
I heard you might be here. Not working
for the Sun now. What's this?

43:03.700 --> 43:06.300
You can't hold back a good
woman from Enid, Oklahoma.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.200
He's a good guy

43:16.500 --> 43:18.900
Yeah, well, you deserve one.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.800
Wanna see Buddy? He's here.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.400
No..

43:29.300 --> 43:32.400
I'd love to, but I don't know if...

43:33.800 --> 43:36.000
it's the best thing for him.

43:37.100 --> 43:41.400
Look, would you give this to him
on his 18th birthday for me?

43:42.500 --> 43:43.800
What is it?

43:46.100 --> 43:47.700
No, Bad. I don't want this.
- Hey...

43:48.000 --> 43:49.200
I don't want this.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.600
Come on, now. Hey...
- I don't-

43:51.700 --> 43:54.600
there wouldn't be this song if not for you.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.100
That's not money.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.700
That's awfully kind of you.

44:05.900 --> 44:09.600
I'm glad to hear you're doing so well.
- Well, one day at a time.

44:14.700 --> 44:17.000
So you'll give me an interview?

44:18.100 --> 44:20.100
I sure will.

44:20.400 --> 44:24.400
I'd say let's do it on the bus,
but it's much prettier out here, isn't it?

44:25.900 --> 44:29.000
It is.
-My god, look at that.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.400
So you've been all right I guess, huh?

44:34.100 --> 44:37.100
I've been all right.
- Yeah. Me too.
