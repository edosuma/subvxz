00:28.400 --> 00:30.500
It's possible.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.400
Get outta here.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.700
Why, most women at one time or
another faked it.

00:37.735 --> 00:40.700
Well, they haven't faked it with me.

00:40.735 --> 00:44.700
Ohh, right right, I forgot,
you're a man.

00:45.100 --> 00:49.100
You don't think that I could tell
the difference?

00:49.200 --> 00:55.900
Oh, Ohh, Ohh...

00:56.200 --> 00:57.500
Hey, you ok?

00:57.900 --> 01:09.700
Oh, Ohh, Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, Ohh...
Ohh, right there! Yes! Yes!

01:09.800 --> 01:13.900
Ohh, Ohhh...

01:14.500 --> 01:18.500
I want what she's having.
Yeah, we're going to hell.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.200
Fuck me, please.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.500
You're bad.
I'm gonna be late for my flight.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.100
I don't care.

01:54.200 --> 01:58.000
- I can not see you for three whole months.
- Don't be a baby.

01:58.035 --> 02:04.800
- I love you.
- Careful, I may just marry you and ruin your life.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.300
You better...

02:08.000 --> 02:13.100
Fine, go be with your...

02:13.300 --> 02:16.600
dead people, Doctor.

02:16.635 --> 02:20.500
Figuring out how they die is gonna help people.

02:20.535 --> 02:23.000
Your hands are so cold.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.800
Time's gonna feel like nothing ok.

02:29.835 --> 02:32.100
I miss you already.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.900
- Love you.
- And I love you.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.400
T..Ted Gray?

03:50.800 --> 03:54.500
- Ben Stravinsky.
- I am. Ben Stravinsky.

03:54.535 --> 03:58.500
- Take it you'll be showing me around?
- Ted Gray, I'm all over it.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.500
Here we are.

04:01.535 --> 04:05.500
County morgue. Ze real banana.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.900
If you check out from any unnatural or

04:08.935 --> 04:12.900
unexplained cause within the city limits
will end up here.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.500
As resident we get full access.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.600
Ah right. This it Pathology Room No. 1.

04:25.635 --> 04:30.100
It's been pretty slow lately, but holiday season's
around the corner, it should hopefully pick up.

04:32.400 --> 04:36.400
Certain people around here couldn't
possibly be anymore annoying.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.600
Beg your pardon?

04:44.300 --> 04:46.300
- Oh no.
- What?

04:46.335 --> 04:49.800
Some of these guys last year,
they decided that...

04:49.835 --> 04:53.300
...they were gonna be God's
gift to this place.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.400
Hey, you have a girlfriend?

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
As pathologists, we'll learn
the nature of disease and its causes...

05:03.100 --> 05:06.800
its processes, development, consequences.

05:06.835 --> 05:14.100
But far from more than that. I'd like to think that
the pathologists has offered a window to God if you will.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.900
Now, it maybe said...

05:16.935 --> 05:22.400
the pathology is a study in all things
human, save for the soul of course.

05:22.435 --> 05:26.200
But it is in that particular branch of
pathology known as forensics

05:26.235 --> 05:29.900
that we will delve into what it means
to be inhuman.

05:29.935 --> 05:32.700
You will see the perversion...

05:32.735 --> 05:36.700
and the corruption of the flesh
by all means unnatural.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.400
By violence.

05:38.435 --> 05:39.700
By toxins.

05:39.735 --> 05:41.100
By madness.

05:41.135 --> 05:45.100
And then we will work backwards,
always back...

05:45.500 --> 05:52.000
To that original pristine design
to determine the offending cause of death.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.100
Dr. Morris?

06:00.900 --> 06:03.000
- Oh, you're...
- Hi.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.200
Dr. Stravinsky, I want you
to hunt down Jake Gallo.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.700
Tell him, I want to see him chop-chop.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.600
Yes sir.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.300
Ahh... quite a pleasure.
I've heard a great deal about you.

06:14.335 --> 06:16.900
How was Africa?

06:16.935 --> 06:19.800
Was a challenge. Quite humbling though.

06:19.835 --> 06:23.400
- A very privileged year.
- Indeed.

06:23.435 --> 06:27.400
I spoke to your future father-in-law this morning,
he's quite proud of you, you know.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.900
And Gwendolyn.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.300
Have had the chance to see her
since you've been home?

06:34.335 --> 06:38.100
- Only briefly.
- Oh, that's a pity.

06:38.135 --> 06:41.700
I have known that girl since she was
barely out of braces.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.400
She's become quite a woman.

06:44.435 --> 06:48.600
You are indeed privileged
and evidently quite talented.

06:48.835 --> 06:50.800
Dr. Morris.

06:50.835 --> 06:52.700
Dr. Gallo.

06:54.700 --> 06:58.200
I would like you to meet Dr. Gray.

06:58.235 --> 07:01.000
Hello Doctor Gray.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.300
Ted comes to us top of his class from Harvard.

07:04.335 --> 07:08.200
- Eighteen weeks at Bellview in New York city.
- Ohh, patient?

07:08.235 --> 07:13.900
Before being accepted in the UNICEF program in Legos,
where he has been for the past four months.

07:13.935 --> 07:17.900
Bleeding heart. I cut one of those
in half this morning.

07:18.300 --> 07:22.300
Jake is our young... star in residents.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.400
Single-handedly solved the Hordon family murders.

07:25.435 --> 07:30.800
If it weren't for a little student intership,
I think the FBI would still be fingering around.

07:30.835 --> 07:32.700
Damn.

07:35.100 --> 07:39.100
I expect you two would get along quite well.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.900
Doctors, this is a simple case of kidney failure.

07:43.935 --> 07:46.400
Blood in the urine, general swelling.

07:46.435 --> 07:49.800
Hey, look at his skin.
Looks like cheddar cheese.

07:49.835 --> 07:53.000
- Excuse me. Pardon my interject.
- By all means.

07:53.200 --> 07:59.700
- He may interject?
- Given the boy's medical history, I believe
he died during a state of hypoxia and asthma attack.

07:59.735 --> 08:02.200
Fresh out of medical books.

08:02.235 --> 08:06.800
Oh forgive me, that seems more like a hypercondural
conclusion than an answer for the deceased.

08:06.835 --> 08:08.700
11 year old boy, overweight.

08:08.735 --> 08:12.600
This last report, Daniel stated he's
been ridiculed at school for his weight.

08:12.635 --> 08:18.100
The weight he started gaining when he began
taking Pediapred to treat an acute asthma condition.

08:18.135 --> 08:21.700
You'll gonna notice there's no trace
of the steroid in blood or bladder.

08:21.735 --> 08:25.700
- Blah blah blah blah blah.
- Is there a problem?

08:25.735 --> 08:29.700
- Doctor please, continue.
- He stop taking the steroid.

08:29.735 --> 08:34.799
In his mind the abuse he suffered from his peers
for being fat was worse than the asthma itself.

08:34.835 --> 08:40.799
Finally during a field-trip to the zoo,
he died from a severe attack.

08:40.835 --> 08:44.800
One can't disregard psychology
when forming a diagnosis.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.200
Ted Gray! Home Run!
No question about it. Acute asthma.

08:53.400 --> 09:01.000
Uhh... no.
I think it's coagulated nasal mucus.

09:01.335 --> 09:04.800
Death by booger.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.000
Sorry man, I didn't see you there.

09:14.900 --> 09:18.300
You wanted to know if there was a problem?

09:18.335 --> 09:22.300
- There is one. We don't like you.
- That's not a problem.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.400
Yeah, so I met Dr. Morris today.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.900
I think the guy still has a crush on you

09:34.935 --> 09:36.000
or me.

09:36.035 --> 09:39.000
Can't be too sure.

09:39.100 --> 09:43.300
Yeah, yeah I'm st.. of course I'm still excited.
The place is beautiful.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.800
The school's beautiful, everything's beautiful.

09:46.835 --> 09:49.200
You're beautiful.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.400
Hey, I gotta get up in four hours,
you're corrupting me.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.200
Yeah, I love you too.
Bye.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.800
Alright everybody, gather around.

10:18.935 --> 10:21.900
I want you to meet my friend Carl.

10:21.935 --> 10:24.300
- Hello Carl.
- Hey Carl.

10:24.335 --> 10:28.000
Now several weeks back, his doctors
recorded that Carl

10:28.035 --> 10:30.600
was experiencing frequent nauseous,

10:30.635 --> 10:36.000
discomfort while urinating, dizziness.
- You're describing my weekend.

10:36.035 --> 10:40.000
His symptoms increased in severity until
Carl decided it's was time to pay us a visit.

10:43.300 --> 10:47.100
Jesus. You killed him.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.800
Oh ohh Jesus!

10:50.835 --> 10:53.300
Dr. Gray has quite nicely severed
the parametral tract.

10:53.335 --> 10:57.300
Disconnecting Carl's nerve from his brain,

10:57.400 --> 11:00.000
which had momentarily forgotten it was dead.

11:00.100 --> 11:07.900
A decidedly entertaining although unnecessary
display of skill. Thank you, young man.

11:09.600 --> 11:13.300
- Dr. Gray. Dr. Gray.
- Ted.

11:13.335 --> 11:16.400
- Ted Gray
- Ben Stravinsky.

11:16.435 --> 11:19.500
That was pretty over the top today huh?

11:20.600 --> 11:22.300
Yeah.

11:31.100 --> 11:36.000
- I'm sorry, you were saying?
- Oh... no... the whole...

11:36.900 --> 11:42.000
- Take care.
- No, yeah.. of course, of course.
It's just like pap... it's pretty cool.

12:13.100 --> 12:17.100
This is what we like to call the food stand.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.500
You guys haven't even got that cage open yet?

12:28.700 --> 12:31.500
Why are we here?

12:31.535 --> 12:34.200
All of us. In here instead of out there.

12:34.235 --> 12:36.300
Why?

12:36.800 --> 12:39.100
Because we prefer the company.

12:39.135 --> 12:42.100
This kind of company.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.000
Am I right?

12:45.035 --> 12:46.400
Vernish.

12:46.435 --> 12:50.400
When I think about them, you know, out there...

12:51.100 --> 12:58.300
...in their rooms, on the streets,
utilising public transportation...

12:58.600 --> 13:03.500
...downloading pornography,
ordering their lives out of catalogs...

13:03.600 --> 13:07.000
...shitting out processed foods,
cashing welfare checks...

13:07.035 --> 13:13.000
...opining, bitching, moaning, consuming, copulating...

13:13.100 --> 13:17.100
...and multiplying.
It makes me sick.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.400
What we need, brothers and sisters,
is less of them

13:23.435 --> 13:25.000
and more of this.

13:25.035 --> 13:28.200
Don't you agree, Dr. Gray?

13:29.300 --> 13:33.300
I can see your point,
not sure I agree.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.900
Ah well, nobody's perfect.

13:39.935 --> 13:42.900
Not even you, Dr. Gallo.

13:47.700 --> 13:51.700
- Ohh God!
- You don't wanna be cutting into the poop pipe, kid.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.700
That stuff will kill you.

13:56.735 --> 13:59.300
Well, we gotta go at some point right?

13:59.335 --> 14:05.300
In that case, wanna come and join us?
We're heading to Thirteen Stones.

14:09.100 --> 14:14.100
Ohh... doctors' in.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Mother fucker...
Fucking hurts man!

14:34.500 --> 14:36.700
Alright.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.200
Ah ahh...

14:41.800 --> 14:45.800
- To the dead!
- To the dead!

14:48.500 --> 14:52.900
Ok. Guys, let's play tell the truth.
Question.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.800
If you could kill anyone and get away with it,
who would you kill?

14:56.835 --> 14:59.700
The guy who invented condoms.

14:59.735 --> 15:01.300
Fuck that guy.

15:01.335 --> 15:04.900
- Griffin.
- I don't know.

15:04.935 --> 15:07.600
C'mon it's an easy quesiton, Griff.

15:07.635 --> 15:11.600
- You maybe.
- Oh I'm sorry, did you want to fuck me that bad?

15:12.100 --> 15:14.500
Just your skull.

15:14.535 --> 15:18.500
Trust me Dr. Cavenaugh,
it's not as good as it looks.

15:23.300 --> 15:26.400
I am interested in what Dr. Gray has to say.

15:26.435 --> 15:29.000
Yeah, c'mon Teddy.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.000
You guys want the truth or something clever?

15:35.035 --> 15:39.000
- The truth.
- Just something clever.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.000
Truth is ya'll full of shit.

15:43.035 --> 15:45.000
Well go on, elaborate.

15:45.035 --> 15:49.300
I mean, who needs motif, who needs a reason to kill.

15:49.335 --> 15:51.800
Just today, Jake, you opened a 16 year old boy

15:51.835 --> 15:54.900
who was shot in the stomach
because somebody wanted his fucking Ipod.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.200
What kind of reason is that?

15:57.235 --> 16:02.400
We're animals. It's in our nature to kill.
Basic, simple.

16:02.435 --> 16:04.900
You should've all figured that out by now.

16:04.935 --> 16:09.000
And of course, if we were civilized or socialized,
we'll be seating around talking about it over a beer,

16:09.035 --> 16:12.000
we don't actually do it.

16:12.035 --> 16:14.200
But could we really get away with it?

16:14.235 --> 16:19.200
To kill anyone? Anyone at all?

16:19.235 --> 16:25.200
Would you kill anyone? Anyone at all?

16:27.100 --> 16:31.200
Good show! Now that's a man after my own heart.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.600
Griff, waddaya say we get some shots?

16:40.600 --> 16:44.300
I wonder about you.

16:45.100 --> 16:48.400
Quit flirting with Teddy, we have to go soon.

16:48.435 --> 16:51.500
Go play with the boys.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.500
So, where're you from?

16:58.535 --> 17:02.500
Where am I from?
Maybe we should just get past that.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.599
Ok.

17:09.300 --> 17:13.099
Drink up. We're outta here.

17:13.135 --> 17:15.300
Where're we goin?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.900
Oh no, not we.

17:17.935 --> 17:22.200
- We. You can take a cab.
- Cool.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.200
I'm sorry man.

17:34.300 --> 17:38.300
Aww, don't be hurt.
Have another beer.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.700
Tomorrow night, just you and me.

17:44.735 --> 17:46.200
Oh yeah? Doing what?

17:46.235 --> 17:49.600
Nothing too exciting.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.000
- W..Watch out!
- Whoaa!

17:59.035 --> 18:03.100
- What the f...?
- That guy was in my fucking lane.

18:04.300 --> 18:08.000
Hello!
It's dead.

18:08.300 --> 18:11.800
C'mon, I want you to see something.

18:15.300 --> 18:19.000
- Fuck!
- Shhh...

18:29.700 --> 18:32.100
How many?

18:33.600 --> 18:35.700
How many do you see?

18:37.400 --> 18:40.300
- One fitty.
- Fitty?

18:40.335 --> 18:42.900
One fitty!

18:44.400 --> 18:52.800
Look bro, here's 80 bucks.
Last in to walk and talk.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.900
Watch your step!

19:16.000 --> 19:19.200
Hey, how's the herb?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.000
You nervous?

19:25.100 --> 19:28.200
No, but I think it's staying in my pants.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.800
You sure about that?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.900
Hey sport!

19:33.935 --> 19:35.600
Shit!

19:35.635 --> 19:38.100
Is this for real?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.100
Hey sexy!

19:42.800 --> 19:44.800
Fuck!

19:45.700 --> 19:49.700
This is an illustration Dr. Gray
of why I hate doing it.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.500
- This is fucked up man.
- Yeah, you think?

19:54.535 --> 19:56.300
Ok, get me the fuck outta here!

19:56.335 --> 19:59.300
- You sure? I mean we're already paid up.

19:59.335 --> 20:01.700
Ok, let's go!

20:21.900 --> 20:25.800
I want you all to work closely
with me on this one.

20:25.835 --> 20:27.700
Sorry.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.900
You smell like a liquor cabinet.

20:31.935 --> 20:35.600
Doctor Bentwood, will you do the honour?

20:35.635 --> 20:38.000
Harper Johnson, 40.

20:38.035 --> 20:42.000
Convicted murderer, recently paroled,
subject was found...

20:44.000 --> 20:47.100
One fitty!

20:50.100 --> 20:51.800
I have to go out.

20:51.835 --> 20:55.800
Forget to use the little boy's room, Dr. Gray?

21:22.500 --> 21:26.200
All the blood tests are negative.

21:26.235 --> 21:31.200
Alright, we have four scenarios running.
We have to narrow this down.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.800
You want to present first?

21:33.835 --> 21:36.000
Sure!

21:36.035 --> 21:40.000
Simple assignment.
The subject was stabbed, excessively.

21:40.300 --> 21:44.300
A minor struggle ensued, and he was shot
at the back of the head.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.000
Cause of the death,
a gunshot wound to the brain.

21:47.035 --> 21:52.900
The lack of blood from the head and the gradations of color
from the toraxic cavity of the neck, would tell us otherwise.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
He would've lost too much blood to live
by the time he was shot in the head.

21:57.035 --> 22:00.300
I think it was a mark, like a gang sign.

22:00.335 --> 22:03.600
They probably watched him die
and then shot him.

22:03.635 --> 22:05.400
Exsanguination via stab wounds.

22:05.435 --> 22:09.100
Alright, let's discuss the trauma
on the left side of the head.

22:09.135 --> 22:10.600
Any information of the meninges?

22:10.635 --> 22:13.600
It's a domino effect in a trauma
of a gunshot wound.

22:13.635 --> 22:16.400
I don't think so.

22:16.435 --> 22:20.700
You wouldn't find any information
after a fatal wound like this.

22:20.735 --> 22:23.700
The subject was obviously struck in the head
on the left side with a bat or kick

22:23.735 --> 22:26.100
or one hell of a hard punch.

22:26.135 --> 22:31.700
Look, there's a left epidural hematoma which caused injury
to the right temporal lobe from shifting in the skull.

22:32.400 --> 22:36.000
This could've happened in the original confrontation.

22:36.035 --> 22:40.000
What concerns me more, is this discoloration.

22:40.035 --> 22:42.100
Well the blood tests did negative.

22:42.135 --> 22:44.800
Well, a solution of potassium cyanide,
will leave no trace in the blood

22:44.835 --> 22:48.800
or organ tissue sample detectable by standard tests.

22:48.835 --> 22:53.000
Besides the stains on Harper's clothes were 70% plasma.

22:53.035 --> 22:57.000
Most of the blood began coagulation
before exsanguination.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.400
So whether he was moved or not...

22:59.435 --> 23:03.400
majority of the blood remains in the body.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.500
I say we run a post-mortem Chem-7 on his major organs

23:06.535 --> 23:09.200
to evaluate his potassium levels.

23:09.235 --> 23:10.700
You really think he was poisoned?

23:10.735 --> 23:17.000
Six to seven hours before cuts were made to his body
the gunshot, followed shortly after.

23:17.035 --> 23:22.000
You know there was actually gunpowder in the stab wounds.
Didn't anyone else notice?

23:22.035 --> 23:25.000
I agree with Ted.

23:25.035 --> 23:28.700
Signs of livor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis,
in the percede external wounds.

23:28.735 --> 23:34.000
It's possible that the poison was injected directly
into the heart, be it the left axle or subscapular regions

23:34.200 --> 23:40.600
or the lungs, be it the intercostal spaces...
enabling the killer to use less of a solution.

23:40.700 --> 23:46.700
This will allow it to go undetected while
still getting the job done.

23:47.100 --> 23:50.200
Lemme get this straight...
Are you proposing

23:50.235 --> 23:53.500
that the man was poisoned with
potassium cyanide

23:53.535 --> 23:57.500
then the killer waited 7 hours,
stabbed him 18 times

23:57.535 --> 24:00.000
and then shot him in the back of the head?

24:00.035 --> 24:04.700
- I realise this is highly improbable.
- That's an understatement.

24:04.735 --> 24:10.100
However, we will explore it.
I will order Chem-7 and we will re-convene.

24:10.135 --> 24:13.500
Ladies, gentlemen.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.900
Nicely done. Might be onto something here.

24:15.935 --> 24:19.900
Hey, meet me here tonight, 9pm.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.200
You truly have a gift Ted.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Wh..What? You gonna bum-poke me?

24:58.900 --> 25:02.600
- Let's go.
- You're late.

25:20.500 --> 25:24.300
This's where you bring all your dates?

25:33.300 --> 25:45.300
Now this wing is over a 100 years old. Obsolete.
If I'd, I'll tear it out and re-built it someday.

26:14.200 --> 26:18.200
So, impress me.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
You killed him.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.300
Maybe.

26:22.500 --> 26:25.000
The point is, how?

26:25.300 --> 26:26.600
That is this? A game?

26:26.635 --> 26:30.500
Exactly!
It's a game.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.700
I don't fucking believe this.

26:32.735 --> 26:35.500
- C'mon get over it, will you.
- Get over it?

26:35.535 --> 26:39.300
There are 6.5 million people
in this city, Ted, trust me

26:39.335 --> 26:41.600
this asshole will not be missed.

26:41.635 --> 26:43.500
Really?

26:43.535 --> 26:47.700
You can't say he didn't have it coming.
Right?

26:47.800 --> 26:50.800
Yeah, he was not exactly a boy scout.
Is that what you want me to say?

26:50.835 --> 26:56.400
Not exactly a boy scout Ted,
he was irredeemable filth.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.900
That was his grandmother, by the way.

27:02.600 --> 27:06.600
But really, who needs a reason.

27:08.500 --> 27:15.200
We're animals. It's our nature to kill.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.100
Remember?

27:19.300 --> 27:22.600
Why show me this?

27:23.300 --> 27:24.800
I don't know, Ted.

27:24.835 --> 27:28.600
I thought the intellectual challenge
might be of interest to you.

27:28.635 --> 27:32.600
- Was I wrong?
- No. No, I find it extremely fucking interesting.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.100
Good. So, what's your theory?

27:36.135 --> 27:38.200
I stay to my case.

27:38.235 --> 27:40.400
Potassium Cyanide?

27:40.435 --> 27:44.400
What are you? Some kind of serial killer?

27:45.800 --> 27:47.500
Oh...

27:47.800 --> 27:51.800
I obviously misjudged you.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.500
Maybe you should just

27:56.535 --> 28:00.500
run along home before the others get here.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.900
The others?

28:02.935 --> 28:06.900
Seriously man, get the fuck outta here.

29:26.800 --> 29:30.000
- Yes?
- How do you know I won't tell?

29:30.200 --> 29:33.000
Because there so happens to exist,

29:33.035 --> 29:37.600
distinct physical evidence putting you
at the crime scene at the time of death.

29:37.700 --> 29:40.500
I know because I placed it there.

29:40.535 --> 29:46.500
And if I was amind to it I could prove with mathematical certainty
and beyond reasonable doubt that you were the one that did it.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.600
But none of that really matters if
you're the boy I think you are.

29:51.900 --> 29:55.900
You won't tell because
that would mean the game is over.

29:56.600 --> 30:00.300
And you never got to play.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
I don't know if you've heard but we got
the results back on our black male. Negative.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.000
I heard. I'm sorry sir.

30:15.035 --> 30:17.800
No, no, no, priviledged from time to time.

30:17.835 --> 30:22.000
- Interesting theory.
- Thank you.
- Well, carry on.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.000
Teddy!

30:32.600 --> 30:34.300
What're you doin here?

30:34.335 --> 30:41.100
It wasn't potassium cyanide because there was no ragged stippling
in the red blood cells. The blood was hypo or smaller.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.900
It was nitric acid.

30:43.935 --> 30:46.400
You brought him a bottle. A gift.

30:46.435 --> 30:48.100
You shared a drink with him,
but you didn't drink.

30:48.135 --> 30:52.000
You mixed athenol and nitric acid with the alcohol.
Probably a flavor to alcohol

30:52.035 --> 30:55.000
to mask the bitter taste.

30:55.035 --> 31:00.200
Using a needle would've been too dangerous because any first
year fucking med student would know to look for the mark.

31:00.235 --> 31:03.900
You cut him up when he was still alive
but unconscious.

31:03.935 --> 31:05.600
So there was no struggle.

31:05.635 --> 31:07.200
Then you put him in the back of your truck,
drove him to fourth avenue

31:07.235 --> 31:11.700
and shot him in the back of the head.

31:11.735 --> 31:19.300
Mother fucker. Ah, you are good.

31:19.335 --> 31:25.800
Hey, you wanna play the game, you gotta bring
something to the table. Comprendo?

32:16.700 --> 32:19.900
So Jake told you about the game?

32:21.600 --> 32:25.200
It's alright, you can say it.

32:28.700 --> 32:32.100
So, are you in?

32:33.200 --> 32:34.200
I don't know.

32:34.235 --> 32:36.100
- You know what you have to do, right?
- Yeah.

32:36.135 --> 32:39.200
I get the idea.

32:50.700 --> 32:54.000
It's an interesting case.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
You know it's always me that ends up with the dirt.
It's a waste of a goddamn ICU.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.800
Mother fucker shoots his wife
and two kids, execution style

33:23.835 --> 33:25.800
then he shoots himself in the throat

33:25.835 --> 33:29.000
two more in the stomach and
he still couldn't get it done.

33:29.035 --> 33:33.200
Double his morphine.
I'll check back in a couple of days.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.100
- He's strapped in.
- Lot of pain.

33:39.700 --> 33:45.700
He tried to pull out his wires.
He see devil soon I think.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.500
- Oh my God, stop the bus. We need a doctor.
- Someone call 911.

34:06.535 --> 34:09.800
- Is anybody a doctor?
- Is she breathing?

34:29.100 --> 34:33.100
- Teddy?
- Hey baby.
- You alright?

34:33.135 --> 34:35.400
Yeah, I'm great. I'm good.

34:37.400 --> 34:42.400
- I got your message.
- You sounded like someone else.

34:43.100 --> 34:46.800
Anyway, do you miss me?

34:47.199 --> 34:49.100
Of course.

34:50.699 --> 34:53.699
How's the work load goin?

34:53.735 --> 34:57.700
Actually that's one of the things
I wanted to talk to you about.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.500
- It looks like next weekend...
- You're fucked?

35:01.535 --> 35:05.500
I'm sorry. There's this mob trial and...

35:05.900 --> 35:07.800
I understand.

35:07.835 --> 35:11.800
Don't be rational, I'm gonna start crying
right here in the middle of the street.

35:13.600 --> 35:17.100
Baby, to be honest, I have expected it.

35:23.600 --> 35:27.000
Atleast there's Thanksgiving.

35:27.035 --> 35:30.200
Absolutely.

35:30.700 --> 35:34.700
My parents are still expecting
us to stay with them.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.800
Of course.

35:38.400 --> 35:42.400
Are you sure it's alright?
Because it's not too late to change your mind.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.300
It's too late.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.200
How so?

35:52.235 --> 35:53.800
Yeah, no...

35:55.600 --> 35:59.500
your parents are great.
It's beautiful there.

35:59.535 --> 36:02.200
We're gonna have the back house
to ourselves, right?

36:02.235 --> 36:04.200
That's true.

36:04.300 --> 36:14.300
- Then it's settled.
- Ok then. I can't wait.

36:18.900 --> 36:21.700
I'll call you tomorrow.

36:21.735 --> 36:23.300
I love you.

36:23.335 --> 36:24.600
You too.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.600
I know exactly what you're thinking.

36:36.635 --> 36:40.600
You think you feel guilty but it's not that.
There's not such thing as guilt.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.900
There's just the fear of getting caught.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.400
It's the first day after,
so that fear's still fresh.

36:49.100 --> 36:53.100
Your brain is all sick and twisted up.
You're paranoid everyone knows.

36:53.600 --> 36:57.100
You fucked up, you're gonna lose everything.

36:57.800 --> 37:01.800
You wanna throw-up but
there's nothing in your stomach.

37:02.400 --> 37:05.800
You're not gonna sleep tonight.

37:06.600 --> 37:13.000
You'll hit the bottom, you'll watch some TV, and look for
any news that they're on you, but there won't be any.

37:13.900 --> 37:20.900
Tomorrow morning, you're gonna wake up and it's gonna
be the same world. Nothing has changed.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.700
That fear, it will start to creep away and after a few days

37:24.800 --> 37:28.100
you're gonna realise no one knows shit.

37:28.135 --> 37:32.100
That this whole bloody thing,
disadvantage to you, so cataclysmic

37:32.700 --> 37:33.900
has somehow

37:33.935 --> 37:37.200
slipped beneath the notice of the world.

37:37.235 --> 37:38.800
And then...

37:39.100 --> 37:42.100
you'll be a new man.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.300
That sheet

38:00.335 --> 38:04.000
on which she embroiled fantails once

38:04.035 --> 38:08.000
spread it so as to cover her face

38:08.500 --> 38:12.500
If her horny feet protrude,
they come to show how cold she is

38:13.600 --> 38:15.300
and dumb.

38:15.335 --> 38:18.900
Let the lamp affix its beam.

38:18.935 --> 38:22.900
The only emperor, is the emperor of ice-cream.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.400
How did you do it?

38:27.435 --> 38:29.900
Later.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.500
Welcome.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.700
I knew you had it in you.

40:28.735 --> 40:30.900
Had what in me?

40:33.600 --> 40:35.500
C'mon, he was gonna die anyway.

40:35.535 --> 40:38.200
Yeah, we're all gonna die anyway.

40:38.235 --> 40:40.200
Fuck you!

41:01.300 --> 41:03.100
So who is he?

41:03.200 --> 41:17.000
Sort of this great man once. He never might know. He built
'em saved up from nothing. At one point he owned seven stores.

41:17.035 --> 41:24.100
He married his highschool sweetheart.
Started a family.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.900
Didn't last long though.

41:28.400 --> 41:32.000
She left him, took the kids.
His business ran down,

41:32.035 --> 41:35.300
he pissed away most of his money.

41:35.335 --> 41:37.600
Why did she leave?

41:37.635 --> 41:41.300
- The highschool sweetheart?
- Yeah.

41:43.200 --> 41:47.200
I forgot to mention, he likes little girls.

41:48.900 --> 41:52.900
In the worse way.
You wouldn't believe what he does to them.

41:58.100 --> 42:02.000
He should've gone to jail but

42:02.035 --> 42:06.500
you know how it goes, right?
It's easier for everyone to say nothing.

42:06.535 --> 42:09.500
How do you know all this?

42:11.100 --> 42:15.100
Because you never forget your first fuck.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.400
He's my father.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.400
I want you to help me.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.700
Because it's my turn for the game.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.300
- Doesn't seem like your type.
- No?

42:43.335 --> 42:46.900
Clearly not like the usual lost cause
from the tournament award.

42:46.935 --> 42:50.900
Oh he may had a few issues with
alcohol and tobacco.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.400
Don't we all.

42:52.435 --> 42:58.000
But for the most part, he seems to have been in
relatively good health for a man of his age.

42:58.035 --> 43:00.400
That is until you came along.

43:00.435 --> 43:04.400
Could you be anymore hot right now?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.200
I wonder what came over you?

43:07.235 --> 43:10.600
It's as if he dropped his lungs
off the side of a building.

43:10.635 --> 43:13.200
Yet the rest of his organs are pristine.

43:13.235 --> 43:16.000
Donor material.

43:16.035 --> 43:18.500
- No signs of asphyxia.
- He didn't asphyxiate.

43:18.535 --> 43:20.200
How can you be so sure?

43:20.235 --> 43:27.500
Because I know what asphyxiation looks like, dummy!
And it don't turn your lungs to jelly.

43:27.535 --> 43:29.600
No.

43:29.635 --> 43:32.600
I was thinking more along the lines of frostbite.

43:32.635 --> 43:34.400
You're kidding.

43:34.435 --> 43:38.400
The epidermis is healthy,
save for a few batches of sun damage.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.400
Are you suggesting that Juliette
locked him in a freezer?

43:42.435 --> 43:43.700
Because, I do not see it.

43:43.735 --> 43:47.700
You don't?
Well, I see it all quite clearly.

43:47.735 --> 43:50.600
This is some kind of bud baby.

43:50.900 --> 43:54.900
This is really medical marijuana for free?

43:55.400 --> 43:58.100
Well, I am in favor.

43:59.900 --> 44:03.900
It's been proven to naturally alleviate pain.

44:03.935 --> 44:07.000
Why should anyone have to suffer, right daddy?

44:07.035 --> 44:09.600
Ain't that the truth.

44:10.100 --> 44:12.100
That's your boyfriend huh?

44:22.200 --> 44:24.200
What was it you said you was again?

44:24.235 --> 44:26.900
A General Practitioner.

44:26.935 --> 44:30.900
So you can prescribe this shit for me, legal?

44:31.900 --> 44:35.400
Yeah, that's right.
Legal, beagle.

44:36.800 --> 44:40.100
Where do I sign?

44:44.200 --> 44:48.200
- No, let's do some whippets first.
- No shit!

44:50.400 --> 44:54.400
You got a prescription for that too?

44:55.300 --> 44:57.500
Who's first?

44:58.600 --> 45:01.100
Thank you.

45:07.600 --> 45:11.600
Med school has its perks huh?

45:40.900 --> 45:42.600
Liquid Nitrogen.

45:42.635 --> 45:46.600
A mixture of chlorofluoro carbons,
nitrogen and a bit of free on my boy.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.700
He died of anoxia.

45:50.735 --> 45:53.800
It wasn't just that he couldn't breathe,

45:53.835 --> 45:57.500
he couldn't adsorb the oxygen.

46:42.900 --> 46:46.000
More challenging mystery is
how Miss Bath here

46:46.035 --> 46:48.000
forced a 340 pound man

46:48.035 --> 46:52.000
to ingest a canister of -75 degree air

46:52.035 --> 46:53.200
all by herself.

46:53.235 --> 46:56.900
She is a very charming girl.

46:56.935 --> 47:00.000
That's true.
She could convince almost anyone

47:00.035 --> 47:03.400
to do what she wanted them to.

47:03.435 --> 47:08.400
You know, one could almost see a
resemblance between the two of you.

47:09.700 --> 47:13.600
But maybe that's just the temperature.

47:32.700 --> 47:35.000
Question.

47:35.035 --> 47:37.000
Are you playing fair?

47:37.035 --> 47:40.000
Is there such a thing?

47:40.035 --> 47:41.400
No.

47:41.800 --> 47:45.100
But don't you wanna know who's the best?

47:45.135 --> 47:47.800
Aren't you a bit curious?

47:48.000 --> 47:50.800
- That was pretty good last night.
- No idea what you're talking about.

47:50.835 --> 47:52.565
Oh c'mon.

47:52.600 --> 47:55.000
You don't expect me to believe that

47:55.035 --> 47:57.300
our little Juliette,
came up with that one on her own, do you?

47:57.335 --> 47:58.765
I've seen her work.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.965
Oh no, maybe there's more to her
than you thought.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.400
Mmm... No, I don't think so.
But maybe there's more to you.

48:04.435 --> 48:05.365
Me?

48:05.400 --> 48:08.500
I'm an open book, Jake.

48:10.200 --> 48:12.850
Priceless.

48:12.885 --> 48:15.500
I'll catch you later, Dr. Gray.

48:15.535 --> 48:17.400
Oh Teddy?

48:17.800 --> 48:20.065
She didn't give you that whole routine

48:20.100 --> 48:24.600
about how her father raped her
when she was a little lass, did she?

48:25.500 --> 48:27.365
Oh... what an imagination.

48:27.400 --> 48:30.100
No, her father is alive and well.

48:30.135 --> 48:32.765
Paid a visit just last month in fact.

48:32.800 --> 48:36.800
Chairman of an obscenely profitable
banking institution.

48:36.835 --> 48:39.900
And a hell of a guy I might add.

48:39.935 --> 48:42.300
A hell of a guy.

48:49.600 --> 48:52.200
Hey...

48:53.300 --> 48:55.400
Who was he?

48:56.900 --> 48:58.800
Who was he?!

48:59.300 --> 49:02.000
Anyone.

49:06.600 --> 49:10.500
Don't fuck with me.

49:11.100 --> 49:13.265
Doctors?

49:13.300 --> 49:17.300
Let's have a look inside.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.165
Cyanide Pill.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.800
I love that band.

49:43.500 --> 49:45.900
Thanks so much.

49:45.935 --> 49:47.165
Thank you.

49:47.200 --> 49:50.800
You want a smoke?

49:52.300 --> 49:56.300
As he inhales, he'd activates the vapors.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.400
Ohh, genius!

49:59.900 --> 50:02.000
It was genius!

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
You've been doing alot of urine work lately.
Good work.

50:55.900 --> 50:58.300
My bad.

50:58.400 --> 51:01.365
You switched his blood.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.365
You found another patient

51:03.400 --> 51:06.000
with an S.H.N.
Then you switched his blood to John Doe.

51:06.035 --> 51:08.500
Am I right?

51:10.100 --> 51:12.100
Fuck you!

51:12.400 --> 51:13.950
Dr. Gray?

51:13.985 --> 51:15.500
Sir.

51:21.600 --> 51:25.600
Is there anything that you would
like to share with me?

51:28.500 --> 51:31.200
I'm sorry. I don't quite follow, sir.

51:31.235 --> 51:33.065
No doubt.

51:33.100 --> 51:36.700
Look, your work has been beyond
reproach exemplary.

51:36.735 --> 51:39.265
- But what concerns me...
- Thank you, sir.

51:39.300 --> 51:43.300
What concerns me is your
extracurricular life.

51:43.335 --> 51:44.967
I'm sorry?

51:45.002 --> 51:46.565
C'mon!

51:46.600 --> 51:49.465
It is obvious that you are using.

51:49.500 --> 51:51.050
One can experiment from time to time,

51:51.085 --> 51:55.842
I mean, God knows I have done my share.

51:55.877 --> 51:59.200
You should know that I planned on
giving you my highest recommendation.

51:59.235 --> 52:01.700
I appreciate it, sir.

52:01.735 --> 52:03.600
No doubt.

52:06.600 --> 52:08.565
What're gonna be doing for the holidays?

52:08.600 --> 52:11.000
Actually I plan on spending it with
Gwen's family.

52:11.035 --> 52:12.065
That's good.

52:12.100 --> 52:14.700
Opportunity to re-think your priorities.

52:14.735 --> 52:16.565
Yes, sir.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.800
And a little time away from Dr. Gallo
wouldn't hurt either.

52:19.835 --> 52:22.500
No, it wouldn't.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.365
Look...

52:30.400 --> 52:33.000
I know you got it all worked out.

52:33.035 --> 52:35.600
The money, the family with means,

52:35.635 --> 52:37.265
pussy...

52:37.300 --> 52:41.300
It would really be a shame if
you fucked it up.

52:45.300 --> 52:47.200
Sir.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.100
What's up with Morris?

52:52.300 --> 52:54.500
Lonely.

52:56.800 --> 53:01.800
C'mon, let's get the fuck outta here
and get a beer. C'mon.

53:14.800 --> 53:18.300
- Hey, it's me. How are you?
- Hello.

53:18.335 --> 53:20.465
Oh Jesus!

53:20.500 --> 53:24.465
- What're you doing here?
- Are you going somewhere?

53:24.500 --> 53:27.500
I told you. I'm leaving town for the holiday.

53:27.535 --> 53:29.465
Right.

53:29.500 --> 53:31.065
The fiancée.

53:31.100 --> 53:33.300
So you're going through with that?

53:33.335 --> 53:35.465
Why wouldn't I?

53:35.500 --> 53:39.400
What about you and Jake?
Don't you have some sort of arrangement?

53:39.435 --> 53:43.200
Nobody owns anybody.

54:10.500 --> 54:13.400
- Hey.
- Hi. How are you?

54:16.500 --> 54:20.500
- You missed me.
- Of course. How could I go on s'long without you.

54:21.900 --> 54:23.665
Look at you.

54:23.700 --> 54:26.100
Baby, you're working too hard.

54:26.135 --> 54:27.265
Oh I'm ok.

54:27.300 --> 54:30.300
Everything's ok now.

54:42.300 --> 54:43.565
So?

54:43.600 --> 54:46.500
I hear you're kicking ass
with the residency.

54:46.535 --> 54:48.467
It has been an experience.

54:48.502 --> 54:50.301
Quentin Morris is a good man.

54:50.336 --> 54:52.168
I never liked that fruitcake.

54:52.203 --> 54:53.451
He speaks pretty highly of you.

54:53.486 --> 54:56.700
Of course. Why wouldn't he?

54:57.000 --> 55:01.865
Look Ted. Bottom line, this program is the right thing
for you right now. Let's me sell you to the brass.

55:01.900 --> 55:04.300
Working for Acxicom D.C.

55:04.335 --> 55:07.100
it's as good as it gets.

55:07.700 --> 55:09.665
Listen Ted.

55:09.700 --> 55:13.700
This job withstand, whether you
and I liked it or not

55:13.800 --> 55:17.800
- is what you have it.
- Thank you.

55:19.100 --> 55:21.165
So what about Africa?

55:21.200 --> 55:23.665
- Enjoy hunting yet?
- Hunting?

55:23.700 --> 55:26.200
I would say hunting is alot better than the city.

55:26.235 --> 55:29.300
Attaboy, I think.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.065
- Daddy.
- Hey honey.

55:31.100 --> 55:35.200
- I'm stealing my fiancée back now.
- Uh oh.

57:16.300 --> 57:19.250
So I have an early Christmas
present for you.

57:19.285 --> 57:22.200
Hey, can you just get it?

57:22.900 --> 57:23.865
No.

57:23.900 --> 57:26.350
It's better.

57:26.385 --> 57:28.765
Impossible.

57:28.800 --> 57:32.300
I'm gonna come back with you.

57:32.335 --> 57:36.200
Not in two months from now.
But now.

57:37.800 --> 57:43.100
I finished all my work and
I can fly back up to take the bar exam.

57:47.100 --> 57:51.000
Hey, only if it's ok with you?

57:51.600 --> 57:54.600
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

57:58.500 --> 58:01.800
Sounds incredible.

58:02.600 --> 58:04.900
You don't mind?

58:28.200 --> 58:31.300
Wow look at this place.

58:32.900 --> 58:35.800
I didn't know you were coming or
I would've cleaned up a bit.

58:35.835 --> 58:39.100
Baby, it's perfect.

58:50.200 --> 58:53.000
Hey, so what're you gonna wear tonight?

58:57.100 --> 58:58.600
Gwen?

59:03.000 --> 59:05.100
What the fuck is this?

59:05.135 --> 59:07.165
Don't freak out.

59:07.200 --> 59:09.750
I holding it for someone.
A resident.

59:09.785 --> 59:12.265
He's trying to kick it.
I'm helping him out.

59:12.300 --> 59:16.000
- A resident?
- Baby, do I look like a twigger to you?

59:16.035 --> 59:20.300
- Why don't you throw it away?
- Because I ran out here in a flash to see you.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.400
If you need help

59:25.300 --> 59:28.050
now is the time to ask for it.

59:28.085 --> 59:31.800
I'm sorry you had to see this.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.900
That is not mine.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.300
- Look.
- I love you.

59:41.335 --> 59:44.300
I love you too.
Look... Hey, look at me.

59:46.200 --> 59:50.200
I know that this is not the world
that we're used to, ok.

59:51.900 --> 59:55.900
If we're gonna to that party,
we should probably get ready.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.465
- Ben.
- Hey, how are ya?

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.500
- I want to introduce you to my fiancée, Gwen.
- Wow, the one and only huh.

01:00:29.535 --> 01:00:32.800
Well it's a pleasure. Yeah, I've been hearing
all about you from day one.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.250
Oh well, you too. It's nice to meet you, Ben.

01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:40.500
- He's great huh?
- Yeah, he's a cute one.

01:00:40.535 --> 01:00:42.165
- Oh, this is Donnna.
- Hi!

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.700
- Hi, Donna. Oh I love your dress.
- Thank you.

01:00:45.735 --> 01:00:46.965
Oh look at this.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.465
The prodigal son returns.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.000
Ok, ok, we can go now.
It's ok.

01:00:52.035 --> 01:00:58.400
Stravinsky.
Stravinsky, you little turd.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.665
Gwen, I'd like you to meet some
fellow residents of mine.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.500
This is Dr. Jake Gallo and
Dr. Juliette Bath. Gwen Williamson.

01:01:05.535 --> 01:01:07.265
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:11.100
Has Ted told you about all
the people he's killed?

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:14.267
Yes. I hear he cuts 'em up quite well.

01:01:14.302 --> 01:01:17.065
- Well, he's learning.
- Yes, he's learning.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:21.000
Practice makes perfect.
The wonderful thing about the death business

01:01:21.035 --> 01:01:25.665
- Never shortage of cliental?
- Yes Gwen, exactly. Exactly.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.400
Blessful immunity from the sicklecal,
economic avenflow.

01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:30.965
You know, people just keep dying
and dying.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
You mind if I straighten this a little tighter?
I cant...

01:01:36.035 --> 01:01:38.065
Are you a school teacher?

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.800
Eh, no, I'm doing my bar exams in February.

01:01:40.835 --> 01:01:44.065
Wow that's impressive.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.965
You haven't killed any lawyers yet,
have you Ted?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.200
Well, there's still so many.
It's hard to keep track.

01:01:50.235 --> 01:01:53.400
You know, I might've ended up a lawyer
if I hadn't passed my M-CATs.

01:01:53.435 --> 01:01:57.265
Oh that's too bad.
We might've been room-mates.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.065
Oh if you'll excuse us,
Dr. Morris would wanna see Gwen.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.800
Oh yeah. You two have a great time.
I mean this is a party.

01:02:02.835 --> 01:02:06.800
You two enjoy yourselves. We'll be at
the trough assembling our meat plates!

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.200
Sorry about that.

01:02:11.235 --> 01:02:12.800
Was it him?

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.200
Very perceptive, counsellor.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:23.800
- I love you.
- Love you too. C'mon.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.000
Dr. Morris.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.400
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Well, you look very sexual.

01:02:35.035 --> 01:02:38.000
I mean alluring.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.565
Are you fucking kidding me?
Huh?

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:52.900
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Oh what? Huh? You wanna fuck that guy?
You wanna fuck that guy? Go fuck that guy.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.065
Hey we got a fucking whore in the room!

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.000
Go fuck him.
Just remember your ass belongs to me.

01:02:57.035 --> 01:02:59.067
You don't fucking own me.

01:02:59.102 --> 01:03:02.200
Oh, I fucking do!

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.800
Fuck this!

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.500
Shit! I gotta take this.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.200
Yeah?

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.800
What's goin on? Where're ya?
Ok, be right there.

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.765
I gotta go.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.300
It's him, isn't it?

01:03:44.335 --> 01:03:46.400
I'm sorry.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:50.400
I know. Becareful.

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.200
Teddy-boy!

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.600
Hello Jake.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.800
Oh fuck!

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.065
Where're the others?

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:31.900
Those sick-pants! Fuck 'em!

01:04:31.935 --> 01:04:33.800
What happened?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.600
Eh, simple transaction Teddy. I paid my money.
I got my money's worth.

01:04:39.635 --> 01:04:42.267
I got stabbed too.

01:04:42.302 --> 01:04:44.865
Good thing you're a doctor.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.800
- We gotta clean this up!
- Clean this up?

01:04:47.835 --> 01:04:51.800
What? This? You wanna clean... like what?
Like this? Like this?

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.100
You're losing it, Dr. Gallo.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.165
Losing it? Teddy!

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.200
Teddy, I just fucking found it!

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:13.800
This is it.
This... this is it.

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.265
Uh oh, who's that?

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:22.300
That's you. That's me. That's me.
Me. You. Me. You. Me. You're me.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.400
You're fucking killer.

01:05:26.435 --> 01:05:29.200
You're fucking enemy.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:38.065
Huh?
You fucking, fucking golden boy.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.300
Playing ramsey with your
fucking eye-pleat cunt!

01:05:41.335 --> 01:05:43.700
She doesn't know you!

01:05:43.735 --> 01:05:45.800
I know you.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.700
What about the game?

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.065
What about it?

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:57.900
Is that why you called me here?
C'mon, let's play.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.800
This woman here...

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.000
By the bubbles in her mouth,
I could see the subdued dire blood lost.

01:06:10.035 --> 01:06:12.665
She died of suffocation.

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:16.700
Precisely.
She choked on her own blood.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.400
So you pocked this one bloodygade in the
temple with that pipe right there?

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.865
- A near fatal aneurism?
- What?

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.000
Of course you need to crack her head open
to know with mathematical certainty.

01:06:34.035 --> 01:06:38.400
Ermm, waddaya mean near fatal?

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.500
You disemboweled...
Probably while she's still alive.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.000
There's blood on her right hand and
her wrist is broken.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:50.000
So I guess I know who stabbed you,
probably while gutting.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.800
Bravo!

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.600
I failed to see the genius here.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.400
You failed to see?

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.800
You failed to see?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.400
Buzzkill.

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:38.100
Let's go to the incinerator.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.500
Hey!

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.500
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.265
'Coz I missed you.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.100
Do you know where I just was?

01:08:04.135 --> 01:08:06.865
With Jake in the dungeon.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.465
He went ape-shit and thrill
killed three women.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.600
I'm done with Jake.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.050
I think you should leave.

01:08:15.085 --> 01:08:18.200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:25.000
Your fiancée was really beautiful.

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.700
You must be very happy.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.600
This is taken directly from
the center of the seminiferus tubulus.

01:09:52.635 --> 01:09:55.200
The mature sperm is showing
definite signs

01:09:55.235 --> 01:09:58.065
of structural abnormalities.

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.500
Dr. Gallo?
You have a moment?

01:10:01.535 --> 01:10:06.600
Certainly Dr. Gray.
Excuse me.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:14.165
I'm done. I'm out.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.100
The words you're saying right now
are very dangerous.

01:10:18.135 --> 01:10:20.465
You should probably be more careful.

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.565
- Nobody gets out.
- Don't be so fucking dramatic, ok?

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.000
It's not like I can
say anything to anybody.

01:10:25.035 --> 01:10:26.517
I'm up to my eyeballs in this shit.

01:10:26.552 --> 01:10:29.965
Yes you are, Ted.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
- I've got my fiancée.
- Oh yeah, your fiancée. That's right. Gwen?

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.265
Hey, maybe she should come down some night.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:41.300
Hey, how about you don't mention her name again.

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:52.900
I'm sorry. It's just...

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.050
You took me off guard last night.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:11:01.100
- Yeah, that was some crazy shit huh?
- Yeah.

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:06.065
You good then?

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:13.200
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.600
Hey, ermm, we have a meeting tomorrow night.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.865
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.765
That's right. You busy?

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.800
Good 'coz you won't wanna miss this one.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:41.700
So I need to take off for a few hours flat.

01:12:41.735 --> 01:12:43.500
I know but

01:12:43.535 --> 01:12:45.700
I have to.

01:12:45.735 --> 01:12:52.000
- You don't have to.
- It'll be the last time, ok? I promise.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:13:00.500
- I believe you.
- You want one of these?

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.900
Here you are.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:29.600
Whoa, we're contiguously short this evening.

01:13:29.635 --> 01:13:31.900
She's with him.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.300
No.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.400
I don't think so.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.600
I think it's time we get
rid of that cocksucker.

01:13:41.635 --> 01:13:44.900
- I concur.
- And her.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.600
Yeah. Fuck yes, and her.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.800
Well, if we're all in agreement,
let the lamp affix its beam.

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:14.900
- What the fuck.
- What the fuck?

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.200
Alright, let's do this.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.600
Doctors, let's have a look inside.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.200
Oh I get it.

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.900
- What happened?
- Oh my God, you haven't heard?

01:15:52.935 --> 01:15:54.265
Heard what?

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.500
There was a fire here last night,
on the lower level.

01:15:57.535 --> 01:16:00.300
Some of our residents were killed.

01:16:00.335 --> 01:16:02.665
Who?

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.665
Juliette Bath and Griffin Cavenaugh

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:09.700
and there's two bodies yet to be identified.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.900
Wait, you said two bodies?

01:16:13.935 --> 01:16:15.865
Unidentified.

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:19.100
- Plus Julieth Bath. Plus Griffin Cavenaugh.
- Right. That's right.

01:16:19.135 --> 01:16:21.367
Then there were four.

01:16:21.402 --> 01:16:23.600
Correct. Four.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:28.400
- Look, I know that you're upset.
- Excuse me. I'm just gonna step outside.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.400
Fuck!

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:18.100
Hi, you remember me from the party?

01:17:18.135 --> 01:17:21.000
- It's Jake Gallo, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:17:21.035 --> 01:17:23.917
Um, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

01:17:23.952 --> 01:17:27.800
- Ted already left.
- I know.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:15.500
I just spoke to Inspector Vincent
from the homicide division.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.800
He finds Jake Gallo's absence
to be quite suspicious.

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:24.700
He also asked me if there was anyone who
might be able to offer any insight or clues

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:26.850
as to why one of my top doctors

01:19:26.885 --> 01:19:30.000
would have committed such an atrocity.

01:19:30.035 --> 01:19:32.067
I could think of no one.

01:19:32.102 --> 01:19:34.701
Can you think of anyone doctor?

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:38.265
Several names come to mind
but since they're all individuals

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:40.000
who were killed in the fire

01:19:40.035 --> 01:19:45.500
I suspect that questioning them
would prove fruitless.

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:49.065
Concerning Gwendolyn.

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:52.500
I can't tell you how devastated I was
when I got the news,

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.600
compounding what is already a tragedy
for the hospital.

01:19:56.635 --> 01:20:01.900
- I know that you loved her a great deal and I'm truly sorry.
- Thank you.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:08.200
As for the cause of her death, I haven't been able
to come up with a firm conclusion.

01:20:08.235 --> 01:20:12.600
Based on my initial examination,
a full autopsy is gonna be necessary.

01:20:12.635 --> 01:20:13.967
I'm doing it.

01:20:14.002 --> 01:20:15.265
Excuse me?

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:18.965
I don't want anyone else to touch her but me.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.200
- You would have to get the parents' permission.
- I've already spoken to the Williamsons.
They gave me their full blessing.

01:20:25.235 --> 01:20:27.465
- I vehemently disapprove.
- Dr. Morris.

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:32.500
I urge you not to stand in the way of
the parents' wishes and my own.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.100
Alright then. She's yours.

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:37.900
- Dr. Gray, good night.
- Good night, David. Rajeeve.

01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.500
Well?

01:24:12.535 --> 01:24:14.065
Well?

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:18.700
I read something wildly amusing today.
Thought I'd share.

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:21.200
Patient Name: Gwendolyn Marie Williamson.

01:24:21.235 --> 01:24:25.000
Age 28, eyes brown, blah blah blah blah blah.

01:24:25.035 --> 01:24:27.165
Ahh haha!

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.000
Conducting pathologist determines
cause of the death to be due to

01:24:30.035 --> 01:24:33.000
an arrhythmia of the heart!

01:24:33.035 --> 01:24:37.600
A direct consequence of
mitral valve prolapse?

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.400
- That's great shit huh?
- That's right. What the fuck do you care?

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:45.165
Because...

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:52.000
I have composed a poem sublime and you are my critic,
you are my only critic, Teddy.

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:54.565
And have you read carefully
your review of my work,

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:59.100
my conclusion is that it sucks!
- Maybe it's just your clothes.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.600
You know that this one was well above average.

01:25:09.635 --> 01:25:13.600
This one was fucking meticulous.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.100
Oh shit...

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:26.500
She never really knew you, did she?

01:25:26.535 --> 01:25:28.517
- My fiancée?
- Yeah, her.

01:25:28.552 --> 01:25:30.065
Just the good side.

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:32.965
No, I didn't think so.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.300
And there you were... oh boy!
Good little soldier

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.050
ready to march down the aisle.

01:25:40.085 --> 01:25:45.100
Fuck man. Fuck.
I did you a fucking favor huh?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.100
You owe me.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.565
By the way

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.550
Props to you for killing everyone.

01:25:52.585 --> 01:25:54.465
Oh yeah, sorry about that.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:58.500
No, no, no, no, my bad.
I should've seen it coming.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.000
It's in the past.
The important thing is, Teddy

01:26:03.035 --> 01:26:06.800
That in the end... in the end

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.200
I won!

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.565
How so?

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.600
Because I did one that you couldn't figure out.

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.800
I win!

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.565
You like that?

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.100
I don't think so.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.800
I think so.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.265
Mitral valve prolapse bullshit!

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:39.300
It's what I told the parents
so that they won't freak out.

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.400
Aha?

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.900
- I actually do have a theory.
- You have a theory?

01:26:44.935 --> 01:26:49.500
Alright. Impress me.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:51.865
Gwen made a fatal mistake

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:56.900
trying to get back on you and when she did,
you covered her mouth with any of your soaked cloth.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.400
You were careful not to
let her lose consciousness though.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.265
After that

01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:11.300
you injected the potassium into the
basilica vein under her armpit

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.065
to help preserve the body

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:18.900
before dripping nitroglycerin
on her tongue.

01:27:18.935 --> 01:27:24.400
And then, you slowly let her fade
into the after life.

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:33.100
She took approximately 7 minutes,

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:39.100
about the same amount of time it takes
for an average person to fall asleep.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:44.600
She could hear everything
that you said to her.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.700
The last thing she saw on this earth

01:27:49.735 --> 01:27:54.000
was your delightful face.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.300
Time?

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:03.400
Six minutes, thirty seconds.

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:06.000
29... 28...

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.200
Dr. Stravinsky?

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.600
Let's have a look inside.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:36.000
teoman

01:28:37.305 --> 01:28:43.759
