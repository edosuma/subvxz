WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.804
Please, please, please.
Okay, what is this?

00:04.880 --> 00:07.133
We're making sure I'm tall enough
to ride all the rides at Disneyland ...

00:07.216 --> 00:08.684
without having
to spike up my hair.

00:08.759 --> 00:11.308
Buddy,
we are good to go.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.138
- Sweet!
- I have been waiting for this day ...

00:13.222 --> 00:17.022
ever since the doctor pointed to the ultrasound
of your mom's womb and said,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.977
"Either that's a fifth limb"-

00:19.061 --> 00:20.529
Okay, no. Gross.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.982
All right. I want everybody
to eat a lot at home ...

00:23.065 --> 00:25.033
because
The Happiest Place on Earth ...

00:25.108 --> 00:27.486
is also home to the most
expensive churro on earth.

00:27.569 --> 00:31.540
Come on. This is gonna be awesome.
Who doesn't love a day at Disneyland?

00:31.615 --> 00:33.242
Can't you and Mom
go without me?

00:33.325 --> 00:35.623
You're the kid.
I think we need you to get in.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.295
Well, it couldn't come
on a worse day.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.089
The technology sector
is tanking.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.543
We're doing a stock market project
in school, and today's the last day.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.879
We all get a thousand
fake dollars to invest,

00:44.962 --> 00:46.635
and as of
market close yesterday,

00:46.713 --> 00:48.386
I'm in the lead.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.888
I may not be the tallest
or the most athletic,

00:50.968 --> 00:52.891
but someday
I will be the richest.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.143
Which is good,
because the ladies love that.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.146
And I've grown accustomed
to a certain lifestyle.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.478
Do you really want girls
who only want you for your money?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.780
I'd like
to have that option.

01:02.854 --> 01:06.279
Manny, put the stock away
and put your ears on.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.531
Mom, I don't think
you have to wear one of these.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.362
Be a kid! Put them on!

01:10.487 --> 01:13.491
Really? Those shoes? What?

01:13.574 --> 01:16.623
Do you know how much walking
you have to do at Disneyland?

01:16.702 --> 01:19.171
Why do you think they have
so many fat people on scooters?

01:19.246 --> 01:21.340
I like wearing the high heels.
I'm fine.

01:21.415 --> 01:25.045
This is just like that jacket you refuse
to bring when I say, "Take a jacket."

01:25.127 --> 01:27.221
"Don't tell me what to do! I'm fine!"

01:27.296 --> 01:29.549
Huh? And you're not fine.
You're cold and shivering,

01:29.631 --> 01:32.225
and I look like the jerk
who won't give his wife a jacket.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.099
So I do.
And then I'm cold and shivering,

01:34.177 --> 01:35.679
and I brought a jacket.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.390
Are you done with
your boring jacket story?

01:38.473 --> 01:39.975
Because we're going
to hit traffic.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.437
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm not gonna give you my shoes.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.524
Ah! That must be Ethan.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.655
Who's Ethan?
Didn't I tell you?

01:48.734 --> 01:51.157
My friend Bethenny's nephew
is coming with us today.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.113
He moved to town
to go to college.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.949
He's very nice, very smart-
big hockey player.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.748
I know what you're doing.
Really? She was so subtle.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.877
Haley has a thing for bad boys,
which was so me.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.799
Clearly.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.298
So, if she's going to be
leaving the nest soon,

02:07.377 --> 02:09.345
we'd prefer it was not
on the back of a motorcycle.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.137
My college roommate had
a motorcycle. Mmm.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.889
Man, I had some good times
on the back of that thing.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.934
Can't believe you did this.
I'm not gonna babysit Bethenny's nephew.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.479
Alex can have him. Okay, I
don't need your rejects.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.352
Hi, Ethan!
Hi.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.730
I'm so glad you could make it.
Thanks for inviting me.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.856
Sure.
Hi. I'm Al-

02:27.939 --> 02:30.362
My 14-year-old sister.
Ethan, was it?

02:30.442 --> 02:33.036
- Yeah.
- Oh.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.656
# Hey, hey #

02:35.739 --> 02:37.741
# Hey, hey #

02:37.824 --> 02:39.792
# Hey, hey #

02:39.868 --> 02:41.666
# Hey, hey #

02:41.745 --> 02:42.917
# Hey ##

02:45.332 --> 02:47.801
And that's my grandpa
and his wife, Gloria,

02:47.876 --> 02:49.344
and her son, Manny.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.012
Wow. You guys have
a big family.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.511
Big family.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.142
She likes him!
Yeah, who wouldn't?

02:56.218 --> 02:57.891
Where'd you find him,
a Tommy Hilfiger catalog?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.855
He got a 2200 on his S.A.T.'s.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.399
And those eyes.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.147
Okay. Did you get him
for Haley or for you?

03:04.226 --> 03:05.694
Mitchell.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.067
You know, I haven't been here
since Dad brought us when we were kids.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.773
Oh, yeah. Remember?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.858
You cried in
the Abraham Lincoln thing.

03:11.942 --> 03:15.992
Hey, he was a great president,
and it was the first robot I ever saw.

03:16.113 --> 03:19.993
When Claire and Mitchell were young, their mom
and I were gonna take them to Disneyland.

03:20.075 --> 03:23.295
But that morning, Dede and I got in
this huge fight over something or other-

03:23.370 --> 03:24.872
surprise, surprise-

03:24.955 --> 03:27.583
and I ended up
taking them on my own.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.465
Claire's biggest fear
was running into the evil queen.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.764
My biggest fear
was that I married her.

03:33.839 --> 03:38.265
Okay, people over 46 inches,
first stop- Indiana Jones!

03:38.385 --> 03:41.138
- Have fun on the teacups, Lily.
- Okay, let's do this.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.815
Oh, okay, wait.
Just a second here, everybody.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.151
All right.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.563
Is that a leash?
No, it's a child safety tether.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.148
This way, sweetie.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.950
It- it's a leash.
Don't- Don't judge us.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.323
Go on.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.868
We have a runner. Lily is
going through a phase-

03:58.989 --> 04:01.868
At least- Oh, we hope it's a phase.
She bolts every chance she gets.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.748
Lily.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.454
Lily!

04:05.537 --> 04:07.335
Lily!

04:07.414 --> 04:10.042
So we had no choice but to put her
on a child safety tether.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.593
It's a leash.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.012
And we did have a choice.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.557
Lily, sweetie, don't pull.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.767
Lily, heel! Dad.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.437
If I'd have known you guys were gonna
do this, I'd have brought Stella.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.431
It was Cam's idea. So much
for the united front.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.937
I'll have you know,
despite all yourjokes, Lily enjoys it.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.858
Okay, sweetie.
You're not helping.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.938
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You guys- Is that Dylan?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.569
What?  Aw, geez.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.284
Dylan? Oh. Hey!

04:36.359 --> 04:39.158
Uh, what are you-
I didn't even know you were in town.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.081
Either did I ...
know you were in town.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.659
This town. Anaheim.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.619
I thought you were
still in Wyoming.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.377
I was, uh,
but, um-

04:49.456 --> 04:51.879
Oh, shoot. You know, I, uh,
gotta meet up with some friends,

04:51.958 --> 04:53.676
and I'm ...
really late.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.472
It was nice to see you, Haley,
and everybody.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.015
Hi.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.764
- And dude I don't know.
- I'm Ethan. it's nice to meet you.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.937
And polite dude
I don't know.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.022
Did Haley used to date
that guy or something?

05:10.101 --> 05:13.150
Yep. You date her,
that's the club you're joining.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.653
Of course he would
still look amazing.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.860
Does he? I hadn't noticed.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.742
Did you know
that Ethan plays the trumpet?

05:20.821 --> 05:23.745
No great surprise
with those lips of his, huh?

05:23.824 --> 05:26.623
Coo-coo-ca-choo,
Mrs. Robinson.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.703
Okay, buddy,
moment of truth.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.541
Yes! Whoo!
Yes!

05:32.666 --> 05:35.886
This is gonna be so awesome!
Yeah!

05:39.130 --> 05:42.509
In 45 minutes,
this is gonna be so awesome!

05:42.592 --> 05:44.435
Yeah!

05:47.347 --> 05:50.021
Look, Reuben, I have
some underperformers I have to unload,

05:50.100 --> 05:52.148
and I don't have access
to a computer.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.946
Log in as "Money Delgado."
Manny!

05:55.021 --> 05:57.649
By all means, Reuben,
go get a Popsicle while the Nikkei closes.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.447
I want to be a pauper.
Come on.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.403
Mom,
my stocks just took a dive.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.659
Your phone is about
to take a dive.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.365
Come on!
Where do we want to go next?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.576
Oh! Ethan and I want to try
the Haunted Mansion.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.161
There is no
"you and Ethan."

06:09.244 --> 06:11.292
Let's go to the Jungle Cruise.
It's right there.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.998
Why? Tired of walking
in those heels?

06:13.081 --> 06:16.176
No. You tired of being
with a hot wife?

06:18.295 --> 06:21.845
Well, well, well. What do you know? Another
caring parent with a child safety tether.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.550
See? We're not
the only people who use them.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.394
Hi! Aren't they adorable?
Oh, and look at your cutie!

06:26.469 --> 06:28.312
Oh, well, yes.
She just wanted to say hi.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.106
Oh. Sorry.
They're a little feisty today.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.060
- Oh! No problem. She's friendly.
- Oh. Rex, gentle.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.566
- Oh. His name's Rex, huh?
- Yeah.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.522
Okay. Lily. No, sweetie-
Lily, um-

06:37.647 --> 06:39.820
Sorry. He just gets excited.
Oh, yeah, no- Oh, no problem.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.823
Lily, stop moving, sweetie.
Stop moving.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.867
Okay, you got this. Okay. Okay, good girl!
Good girl! Sorry.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.252
You know what the fight
with Dede was about?

06:50.327 --> 06:53.922
I taped a football game
over an episode of Dallas.

06:53.997 --> 06:58.002
Who bails on a family trip to Disneyland
over something like that?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.712
Ironically, Dallas
was playing in the game.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.014
And I remember
pointing that out to her,

07:03.089 --> 07:06.218
and then I remember
a videocassette flying at my head.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.563
You do not' play the cello. I do.
Even geekier- I'm good.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.353
Okay, answer me this-
I will answer you this.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.685
Why do people
carry cellos around?

07:14.768 --> 07:17.021
You know, people aren't expected
to lug a piano around.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.613
What's the cutoff?
I know, right?

07:18.688 --> 07:21.612
Like, go where the cello is.

07:21.691 --> 07:26.447
Oh, look at this. I think I've inadvertently
set up my 14-year-old with a college boy.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.073
The boy was your doing?
Yes.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.330
Yes, and he was perfect,
and Haley was into him,

07:31.409 --> 07:33.036
until, of course,
we ran into Dylan.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.247
I mean, come on, Dad.
What are the odds of that happening?

07:35.372 --> 07:36.874
It's a small world.
Yes, it is.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.501
See what I did there? It's a ride.
I did. Got it. I got it.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.838
It's just so frustrating because
I know I can't run Haley's life for her,

07:42.921 --> 07:46.016
but if she would let me,
I would be so good at it.

07:46.091 --> 07:49.015
Right, 'cause parents
always know what's best for their kids.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.813
You remember that nice girl at the office
I tried to fix Mitch up with?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.390
No offense, Dad,
but I think ...

07:53.473 --> 07:56.477
I probably have a better sense
of what my kids need than you did.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.195
I think it's cute you think that.
Oh.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.524
Mom!
It was so awesome!

08:02.607 --> 08:06.157
The jeep was jerking around, and- and there
was a lot of sharp turns and big drops.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.745
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
It just kept going.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.991
Wow. You okay? Great.
Why wouldn't I be?

08:11.116 --> 08:14.620
Because you're kind of leaning on me.
isn't that what a marriage is?

08:14.703 --> 08:16.956
Oh, Alex,
stop touching him.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.333
You look like hell.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.963
Feel a little dizzy.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.510
I think that ride
did something to me.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.178
Fluid in your inner ear
is thickening.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.138
That's what happens when you get old.
It is?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.182
Yeah,
you can't take the motion.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.681
I gotta pop a Dramamine
to get in my swivel chair.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.808
That is not it.
I'm king of the roller coasters.

08:33.929 --> 08:37.230
I think I just put too big of a whipped
cream smile on my pancake this morning.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.854
You guys wanna go on Matterhorn? Luke, I think
me and your dad are gonna sit this one out,

08:40.937 --> 08:42.438
maybe get one of them
big pickles.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.492
No! You're gonna have to eat
that pickle on your own, Jay.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.490
I still got
a few good years left.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.448
Luke, wait up!
I'll race you there!

08:53.116 --> 08:54.618
I'm good. I'm good.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.670
Okay, everybody's looking at us.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.090
I haven't been judged by this many people
since I forgot my canvas bags at Whole Foods.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.388
Yeah. Well, maybe they're staring
because we have what they want.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.636
Wh- Oh, a pet daughter.
Is that-

09:08.715 --> 09:10.217
You know, I don't care
what people think.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.768
If I thought it would
keep my daughter safe,

09:11.843 --> 09:13.641
I would have a kangaroo pouch
sewn into my midriff.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.564
That's gonna work out
really well for you as a single parent.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.767
Okay, we just got a glare
from Mr. Socks-With-Sandals.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.318
All right. That's it.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.779
Lily, I'm gonna take off this leash.
I think it's a mistake.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.528
But I don't want you to run away,
'cause that would be very, very unsafe.

09:25.607 --> 09:30.078
And if we lost you, you'd be very scared,
and we'd be very sad, okay?

09:30.195 --> 09:31.663
Okay.
All right.

09:31.738 --> 09:35.163
See, Cam? You treat her
like a human being, and she acts like one.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.538
Chip 'n' Dale!

09:36.618 --> 09:39.337
Oh, great.
Now she's chasing squirrels. Lily!

09:39.454 --> 09:41.877
Honey, come on!
Lily! Lily!

09:47.087 --> 09:50.591
- Hey, how was Splash Mountain?
- It was great. Maybe we go again.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.675
No, thanks.
There was no reception in there.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.853
You know how many bars I had?
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.930
Reuben, talk to me!

09:57.013 --> 09:59.937
Must be nice to
get out of those shoes for a minute.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.814
I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.486
Nothing. I'm just
making conversation.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.563
Hey. Check it out.

10:05.647 --> 10:10.403
I bought one of those souvenir photos
with you and Manny on the ride.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.533
Boy, it looks like
you're having a good time.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.614
Wait a minute.
What's that in your hand?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.199
Are those shoes?

10:16.282 --> 10:18.034
I'm not even sure
that that is us, Jay.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.665
Why are you
walking around in pain?

10:19.744 --> 10:21.917
Just admit the shoes
were a bad idea.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.589
I am not in pain.

10:23.665 --> 10:27.260
I just didn't want my favorite
walking shoes to get wet there.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.053
Okay. My bad.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.674
Well, we've gotta meet everybody in
Tomorrowland, so we'd better get movin',

10:32.757 --> 10:34.805
'cause it's all the way
on the other side of the park.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.386
I'm fine.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.892
You just try
to keep up with us.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.522
I can't take this.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.905
Dad, throw your hands up! it's fun!

10:46.980 --> 10:48.948
Oh, yeah, it is fun!

10:49.065 --> 10:51.033
Hey! Yeah!

10:51.109 --> 10:52.110
Whoo!
Hey.

10:52.193 --> 10:56.448
Whoa! Whoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

10:56.531 --> 11:01.162
Reuben, if you heard about that stock
at a birthday party, it's already too late.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.996
Gloria!

11:03.079 --> 11:04.547
Gloria,
sit down for a second.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.042
I'm fine, Jay.
Please?

11:07.167 --> 11:10.421
Look, you may not be in pain.
Okay.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.631
But I'm in pain
just thinking you're in pain.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.510
So humor me for one minute.
What are those?

11:16.593 --> 11:20.097
There wasn't a big selection
at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.682
Are you crazy?

11:21.764 --> 11:25.735
I cannot walk around in public
with these ... things.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.063
They're so yellow
and so ugly.

11:28.146 --> 11:32.401
And- And they're so softy
and so comfortable.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.110
Jay, what is this?

11:35.111 --> 11:37.034
Thank you for
going shopping for me.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.366
Thank you for worrying
about my feet.

11:39.449 --> 11:43.044
Thank you for giving me
your jacket when I'm cold.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.668
Such a good man, Jay.
Thank you.

11:45.747 --> 11:46.873
Mmm.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.001
Wow.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.883
I didn't expect you
to be so-

11:52.962 --> 11:53.963
so nice.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.051
Why are you so surprised?

11:57.133 --> 12:00.808
Now, please, don't go
all Latin on me when I say this.

12:00.887 --> 12:05.814
Is it possible you get angry,
from time to time,

12:05.892 --> 12:08.145
because you're
always wearing ...

12:08.228 --> 12:10.151
uncomfortable shoes?

12:14.317 --> 12:16.160
Maybe.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.330
Can you get me
a couple of more?

12:18.446 --> 12:21.495
Maybe they have purple?
Whatever you want, honey.

12:23.326 --> 12:27.081
All I'm saying is, it seemed like you were
pretty into Ethan until Dylan showed up.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.007
Don't get me wrong.
Ethan's nice, but he's no Dylan.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.585
Maybe that's a good thing?

12:31.668 --> 12:33.591
Why? Because Dylan's
a free spirit?

12:33.670 --> 12:37.049
He's too edgy for you?
He plays by his own rules?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.301
Oh, my God.
What?

12:39.384 --> 12:43.981
I beg of you to turn around and experience
with me the greatest moment of my life.

12:44.055 --> 12:49.607
# Daisy, Daisy
You're the one I adore #

12:49.686 --> 12:51.859
Your rebel boyfriends
a Dapper Dan.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.950
Maybe that's not him.
# I want to be with you more #

12:55.066 --> 12:58.320
Oh! 3 It won't be a stylish- #

12:58.444 --> 13:01.368
Dylan! Uh- Uh, sorry.
Sorry.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.700
Certainly seems like him.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.456
Oh, my God. He looked like those
old pictures of Dad from high school.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.961
Mm-hmm.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.508
I'm really into street art
at the moment.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.335
There's a really great exhibit downtown.
I'll take you.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.306
Oh, on what, your Razor scooter?
Mom wants you. Uh- Uh-

13:18.381 --> 13:21.225
Ethan, I've been looking all over for you!

13:24.387 --> 13:27.311
I remember I was on
Pirates of the Caribbean,

13:27.390 --> 13:30.143
and this whole fight with Dede
was really eating at me.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.696
And there was this angry animatronic
wench with a rolling pin ...

13:33.771 --> 13:35.364
chasing some poor
pirate around.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.034
They were on a track,
running in circles,

13:38.109 --> 13:40.328
so he could never
get away from her.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.121
And I remember thinking,

13:42.196 --> 13:44.699
"I can't save you, buddy,

13:44.782 --> 13:46.784
but I'm getting
off this ride."

13:46.868 --> 13:49.291
A-And we-
A-And we were going around a corner,

13:49.370 --> 13:51.839
and I was screaming,
and I swallowed a bug!

13:51.914 --> 13:54.212
Oh, being tall is everything
that I dreamed it would be.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.462
What should we do next?
Sit down.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.806
Where we gonna sit down? The ground.
Here. This is good. Right here.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.424
Oh!
Are you okay, Dad?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.851
No, I'm not okay.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.645
I hate to say this,
but these rides are killing me.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.937
But you're the king of
roller coasters. I know!

14:10.016 --> 14:12.394
Something happens
when you get older.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.196
Guess you can't take it.

14:15.271 --> 14:19.367
One of my favorite things in the world
is doing stupid fun stuff with you,

14:19.442 --> 14:22.742
like pogo-stick basketball or trying
to get a swing to go all the way around.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.323
Next time, we should sit
on a fire extinguisher.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.167
Yes, or a bottle of Coke
and some Mentos. Ah.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.540
Honestly, though,
the way I'm feeling right now,

14:30.620 --> 14:32.588
I don't know if there's
gonna be a next time.

14:32.663 --> 14:36.634
Dad, we can always
find cool stuff to do.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.053
Even if you're old
and in a wheelchair,

14:39.128 --> 14:41.802
I'll take you to the mall and push you
as fast as you wanna go.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.304
Really? You'd do that?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.853
Heck, yeah.
And we'll pop some wheelies too.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.564
That sounds fun. And I'll take you to
the top of a huge hill and just let go.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.645
Okay, we'll nail down the specifics later,
but that- that's really nice.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.939
So, do you still
wanna talk or-

14:58.064 --> 15:00.487
No, go. Ride Space Mountain.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.694
Hey. Hey, uh, at the end,
when they take a picture,

15:02.777 --> 15:04.404
do something hilarious
for both of us.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.114
You're gonna die.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.038
When you see it, not
'cause you're old. Yup.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.915
Whoo!

15:10.993 --> 15:13.246
Lily! Lily, stop!

15:13.329 --> 15:14.501
Dad! Dad, grab her!

15:14.622 --> 15:17.296
Hey! I got ya, you little monkey!
Thank you.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.003
Hey, Cam, I got her.
We're in Fantasyland. Where are you?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.173
Okay, it's Toontown,
not "Toonton."

15:23.256 --> 15:25.054
You've been watching
too much PBS.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.852
Thank you.
All right, honey. Come here.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.604
I don't like this thing.
Yeah?

15:30.680 --> 15:35.561
Well, I don't like running like a crazy person
through Downton- Downtown Disney.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.234
I don't know what to do.
The leash is not the answer.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.064
- You want my help?
- Yes, please!

15:40.148 --> 15:42.071
'Cause I can fix this for you
in about two minutes.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.869
Come on, baby girl.
Come with me. We'll be right back.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.535
Okay. Where we going?
Oh, this way?

15:50.408 --> 15:51.955
Ugh!

15:52.034 --> 15:55.664
Manny, you don't sound very happy
for a kid that is flying an elephant.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.090
I lost to Durkas.
It's not fair.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.794
He wanted to buy IBM
because he thought it was funny to say.

16:00.877 --> 16:04.347
Well, I'm glad that you lost.
Fake money has changed you.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.972
Where is the Manny that used to stop
to smell the roses?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.144
He took a bath on
a solar start-up in San Jose.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.598
You have been so busy burying
your face in your phone ...

16:13.681 --> 16:15.979
that you barely said hello
to your family,

16:16.058 --> 16:18.652
you gave Winnie-the-Pooh
the cold shoulder ...

16:18.728 --> 16:22.073
and you haven't even noticed
that pretty girl in the blue elephant ...

16:22.148 --> 16:23.946
that has been smiling at you.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.954
Not my type.
But still, nice to be noticed.

16:28.029 --> 16:31.329
You see what happens when you're not
burying your head in business?

16:31.407 --> 16:33.535
You're right.
I'll try to be more present.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.332
What the heck's on your feet?
They're slippers.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.884
They're like pillows.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.803
Attagirl.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.632
You're welcome.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.183
Look. Your dad
got her baby high heels,

16:49.258 --> 16:51.010
which we said we were never
gonna let her wear.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.266
- I love 'em.
- You look gorgeous, sweetie.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.939
Oh, my God.
You thought people judged us before?

16:55.056 --> 16:57.309
Wait till they meet Little Miss Anaheim.
Who cares? Look at her.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.018
She can barely move.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.354
Thank you, Dad.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.281
You know what? She's got
pretty good garns for a 3-year-old.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.403
Cheese!

17:08.528 --> 17:11.372
Got it. Thanks, Little John.
Thank you.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.371
Aw.
Oh! They have corn dogs.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.417
We gotta get one before we go back.
They are legendary.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.538
I'll be right back.
Okay.

17:18.621 --> 17:22.046
Haley!
It's me, Dylan.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.798
I'm in the bear suit.
I borrowed it to talk to you.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.753
Why are you
dancing like that?

17:26.837 --> 17:28.760
This is what
Little John does.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.887
Maybe. I don't know what movie
this dude is from.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.685
I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.512
Well,
I'm not talking to you.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.723
No, you can talk.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.729
I know. But I'm mad.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.731
You came back to town
and didn't even call me.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.562
I was embarrassed.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.821
I lost my job at the dude ranch,
and I wanted to get my act together first.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.776
What, the
four-dweebs-on-a-bike act?

17:48.859 --> 17:53.205
Okay, the Dapper Dans are
a Main Street tradition since 1959.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.783
Hey. What's going on?

17:55.783 --> 17:56.875
Nothing.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.249
I still love her,
Ethan.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.668
Okay, how do you know my name?
it's Dylan.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.170
Look, I don't wanna
harsh your day,

18:04.250 --> 18:07.971
but I've never stopped loving Haley,
and I never will!

18:08.045 --> 18:09.672
I-Is this
some sort of joke?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.725
- Do I look like I'm joking?
- Dylan, let's not do this now.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.929
It has to be now.
I've got a parade at 3:00.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.480
Hey, seriously, dude,
back off.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.274
Okay. That was my face.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.693
And you're the one
who needs to back off.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.815
Oh!
Oh. Ho! You-

18:26.897 --> 18:30.447
Okay. This thing's kinda heavy.
I can't get up.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.871
Ethan? Ethan, what is going on?
What are you doing?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.823
Uh, hi, Mrs. Dunphy.
Help me up.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.034
Oh. No.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.543
If I could get up, I would-

18:44.624 --> 18:47.673
Come on, Lily, sweetie.
Keep up, honey. Come on.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.471
Phil, you don't look like
you're doing very well.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.846
Maybe because I officially became an old
man back there at Thunder Mountain.

18:53.924 --> 18:58.054
Oh. Oh, my goodness. You are burning up.
You might have the flu.

18:59.972 --> 19:04.603
A bunch of guys at work had the flu, and we all
drink orange juice out of the same carton.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.071
We should get cups.
Hmm.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.695
Luke, did you hear that?
I have the flu!

19:09.774 --> 19:11.367
Glad we didn't
share that pickle.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.865
Hey, everybody.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.537
Oh, hey- Hey, guys.
Where's Ethan?

19:15.613 --> 19:17.411
Oh, he's staying.
He ran into some friends.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.164
But Dylan got fired, so-
Don't freak out.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.495
We have to give him
a ride home.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.580
And we're back together.
Yay.

19:25.915 --> 19:29.010
Hey, no one goes home
till we hit the Lincoln thing.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.679
Yawn. Don't even
try to fight it.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.222
Yeah, he made us go
when we were kids.

19:33.297 --> 19:37.393
Come on, people. It's a robotic president.
What's not to love?

19:37.468 --> 19:38.970
The robotic president?

19:39.053 --> 19:41.852
So my plan was,
drive Claire and Mitchell home,

19:41.931 --> 19:46.402
put them to bed,
pour myself a big tumbler of scotch ...

19:46.477 --> 19:48.195
and tell Dede it was over.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.523
But on the way out,
we made one last stop.

19:50.606 --> 19:54.486
If destruction be our lot,

19:54.568 --> 19:59.369
we ourselves must be
its author and finisher.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.918
As a nation of free men,

20:02.993 --> 20:05.416
we must live
through all times-

20:05.496 --> 20:09.217
I don't know what happened. Maybe it's what
robot Lincoln said about a man's duty ...

20:09.291 --> 20:12.090
or keeping
the Union together.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.888
Maybe I just chickened out.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.342
But I realized
that staying with my kids ...

20:17.425 --> 20:20.269
was more impo?ant
than leaving my wife.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.893
Now that's not
the right decision for everyone,

20:22.972 --> 20:25.066
but it' was
the right decision for me.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.769
And in that faith,

20:27.852 --> 20:29.946
let us, to the end,

20:30.020 --> 20:32.523
dare to do our duty ...

20:32.606 --> 20:34.108
as we understand it.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.660
So I stuck it out
until they were grown.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.115
Jay, you want
to join me in the Jacuzzi?

20:40.197 --> 20:43.497
And the universe
rewarded me.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.164
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.749
Hey, Dad,
roller coaster fist bump.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.384
Whoa!
Whoo!

20:53.586 --> 20:56.214
Whoo!
Whoo!

20:56.338 --> 20:59.217
Oh. Oh!

20:59.341 --> 21:00.809
Oh.
What was that?

21:02.762 --> 21:03.854
Whoo!

21:05.347 --> 21:08.567
This is gonna be so awesome!
Whoo! Hey!

21:11.937 --> 21:14.565
Close your eyes.
It makes it more fun.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.275
Oh, yeah. That is more fun.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.487
Ooh. Oh!

21:29.580 --> 21:30.581
