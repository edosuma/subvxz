00:01.632 --> 00:03.416
<i>Paris.
Woo-hoo!</i>

00:03.460 --> 00:04.635
Nicely done.
Great job!
-Guys!

00:04.679 --> 00:06.637
I've barely startedthe presentation.

00:06.681 --> 00:07.638
Sorry, Gloria!

00:07.682 --> 00:08.813
Paris.

00:08.857 --> 00:10.554
City of love!

00:10.598 --> 00:12.817
- City of hunchbacks.
- Hey!

00:12.861 --> 00:14.732
City of... cafés!

00:14.776 --> 00:16.821
Hello. I'm Gloria Sato.

00:16.865 --> 00:18.431
And ever since
I moved to Big City,

00:18.475 --> 00:20.477
I've had one <i>big</i> dream.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.218
To open my own Parisian café.

00:22.261 --> 00:23.567
Now, you're probably wondering,

00:23.611 --> 00:26.048
what qualifies me
to run a French café?

00:26.091 --> 00:27.789
I was wondering that, yes.

00:27.832 --> 00:30.574
Recently, I have worked
many, many jobs.

00:30.618 --> 00:31.938
But none have
prepared me for this

00:31.967 --> 00:34.622
more than working as the
manager of Big Coffee.

00:34.665 --> 00:36.667
I prepped orders,
took care of the store,

00:36.711 --> 00:38.234
and supervised employees!

00:38.277 --> 00:39.888
Wow! You did all that?!

00:39.931 --> 00:42.630
I have the passion, experience,
and now opportunity

00:42.673 --> 00:45.023
to make my dream
finally come true.

00:45.067 --> 00:47.635
Now I say to you,
bankers of Big City,

00:47.678 --> 00:51.682
Will you give me a loan
so I can open my new café?

00:52.553 --> 00:53.553
Now you can clap.

00:55.164 --> 00:57.645
Good luck! The bankers
will see right through you!

00:57.688 --> 00:59.385
Starting a business takes <i>grit,</i>

00:59.429 --> 01:01.649
and you just don't have it!

01:01.692 --> 01:02.824
Now, that's just not true!

01:02.867 --> 01:04.956
I know Gloria can get that loan.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.305
We're here for you, Gloria.

01:06.349 --> 01:07.785
We'll help however we can!

01:07.829 --> 01:10.092
Thanks, guys!
I appreciate you saying that.

01:10.135 --> 01:12.055
You have been like
a second set of parents to me.

01:12.094 --> 01:13.138
I won't let you down!

01:13.182 --> 01:14.444
We know you won't!

01:14.487 --> 01:15.488
All right!

01:15.532 --> 01:17.578
It's time... for Gloria...

01:17.621 --> 01:19.754
to achieve her dreams!

01:25.194 --> 01:26.804
Hark!

01:26.848 --> 01:29.372
Are those the moaning cries
of a wounded animal?

01:29.415 --> 01:30.895
Oh, it's just Gloria.

01:30.939 --> 01:32.767
Gloria, what happened?
Where's your loan?

01:32.810 --> 01:35.683
Are you holding it?
What <i>is</i> a loan?

01:35.726 --> 01:37.728
No, Cricket,
it... it didn't work out.

01:37.772 --> 01:39.730
I won't be able to
rent a café space.

01:39.774 --> 01:42.341
My dream is officially dead!

01:42.385 --> 01:44.561
Aw, don't worry about it,
things come and go.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.564
I'm sure you'll find another
lifelong dream in no time!

01:47.608 --> 01:49.087
I wasn't asking for much!

01:49.131 --> 01:51.046
All I needed was an empty space

01:51.089 --> 01:53.788
I could run a small coffee
joint out of!

01:53.831 --> 01:55.485
Huh.

01:55.528 --> 01:57.356
They must have forgotten
to lock this place up

01:57.400 --> 02:00.577
Wow! The ol' Big Coffee space...

02:00.621 --> 02:02.057
Yeah. A lotta
good memories here.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.668
Man, all this place needs
is a good cleaning,

02:04.712 --> 02:06.583
maybe some chairs and tables...

02:06.627 --> 02:07.758
could be good as new!

02:07.802 --> 02:08.977
Cricket, that's it!

02:09.020 --> 02:10.674
- Wait, what's it?
- This is it!

02:10.718 --> 02:12.937
This is my cafê!
The location is great!

02:12.981 --> 02:15.810
The customers wouldn't know
if I was illegally renting
the space or not

02:15.853 --> 02:17.653
And we can work with
the run-down look as a...

02:17.681 --> 02:20.423
French Revolutionary theme.

02:20.466 --> 02:22.773
<i>With all the business
we'll get, in a few days,</i>

02:22.817 --> 02:25.098
<i>I could make enough money
that I wouldn't even
need a loan!</i>

02:26.951 --> 02:27.996
And best of all,

02:28.605 --> 02:29.713
your mom and dad
won't ever have to know

02:29.737 --> 02:30.931
that I failed in
the first place.

02:30.955 --> 02:32.522
You guys in?

02:32.565 --> 02:34.698
Teaming up to run
a secret underground café?

02:34.742 --> 02:36.134
Oh, we're in.

02:47.798 --> 02:49.147
Guess it's time to open up!

02:49.191 --> 02:50.690
We need to think of a way
to bring customers in

02:50.714 --> 02:52.803
without too many
people noticing.

02:52.847 --> 02:54.370
Leave that to us!

02:54.413 --> 02:55.739
Grabbing people's attention
is my whole thing!

02:55.763 --> 02:57.634
And Tilly's great
at keeping secrets.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.855
Nobody's getting in without <i>
la phrase secréte!</i>

03:00.898 --> 03:03.422
All right then! Get out there,
you little delinquents!

03:03.466 --> 03:05.860
People of Big City!

03:05.903 --> 03:07.862
Aren't you tired
of the same old coffee?

03:07.905 --> 03:10.212
Don't you want your bean juice
experience to be more...

03:10.255 --> 03:12.083
- exclusive?
- I'd like that!

03:12.127 --> 03:13.998
Then you're in luck,
my thirsty friends!

03:14.042 --> 03:15.478
Just follow my instructions,

03:15.521 --> 03:16.784
and keep it hush-hush.

03:18.829 --> 03:21.745
Huh. That little boy said
to come back here...

03:21.789 --> 03:23.007
Halt!

03:23.051 --> 03:24.356
Password, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

03:24.879 --> 03:26.968
The purple dove
flies at midnight.

03:27.011 --> 03:28.839
You are free to enter, <i>
mes enfants!</i>

03:32.016 --> 03:33.626
Ooh! Culture.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.672
- Need a refill?
- Please!

03:35.716 --> 03:38.806
Okay, this is the <i>best</i> café
in Big City, Terry.

03:38.849 --> 03:40.285
- Gloria!
- Ahh!

03:40.329 --> 03:41.765
Just running
a lil perimeter check.

03:41.809 --> 03:44.550
- How's it all goin'?
- Pretty good, actually!

03:44.594 --> 03:46.224
If we can keep this going
for a few more days,

03:46.248 --> 03:48.554
I think I'll be able to
rent this place for real!

03:48.598 --> 03:50.818
We just need to make sure
nothing unexpected happens.

03:50.861 --> 03:51.949
What's going on in here?!

03:52.341 --> 03:53.884
- We heard noises!
- Where's the squatters?!

03:53.908 --> 03:55.823
Wait! What is all this?

03:55.866 --> 03:57.999
Guys, it's okay!

03:58.042 --> 03:59.783
This is... my café!

03:59.827 --> 04:01.002
You got the loan!

04:01.045 --> 04:02.220
You're open already?

04:02.264 --> 04:03.744
Isn't it obvious?

04:03.787 --> 04:05.789
The rustic atmosphere,
the accordion music...

04:05.833 --> 04:08.139
The front door
that should be <i>locked!</i>

04:08.879 --> 04:11.577
This doesn't look anything
like the café in your
presentation!

04:11.621 --> 04:13.797
Why is everything
so old and drabby?

04:13.841 --> 04:15.819
Weren't you able to buy some
new things with your loan?

04:15.843 --> 04:18.759
Oh, no, it's exactly
what I wanted!

04:18.802 --> 04:20.108
Same as I said before!

04:20.151 --> 04:21.805
You don't got the grit for this.

04:21.849 --> 04:23.502
Now, don't listen to her.

04:23.546 --> 04:25.263
Oh! I was gonna save this
for when you were open,

04:25.287 --> 04:26.723
but seeing as that's now...

04:26.767 --> 04:28.812
Where's he going?

04:28.856 --> 04:30.553
Well, whaddya think?

04:30.596 --> 04:33.643
Oh, my gosh...!

04:33.686 --> 04:36.602
It's so eye-catching!

04:36.646 --> 04:39.475
Yup! Now everyone in Big City
will know you're here!

04:39.518 --> 04:41.607
Yes... That is true.

04:41.651 --> 04:43.087
Hey, why don't you guys
head inside

04:43.131 --> 04:44.741
and I'll get you some menus?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.004
No thanks.
You call this a business?!

04:47.048 --> 04:49.311
This whole operation will
collapse in a day!

04:49.354 --> 04:50.791
Mark my wor...

04:50.834 --> 04:52.314
What she means to say is,

04:52.357 --> 04:54.403
we're so proud of you
and you're doing great.

04:54.446 --> 04:56.100
Nice work, big shot!

04:56.144 --> 04:57.580
Thank you!

04:57.623 --> 04:59.103
Cricket.

04:59.147 --> 05:01.540
- Deal with the sign.
- Affirmative.

05:03.064 --> 05:05.849
Hour one of my shift
and I'm already sleepy.

05:05.893 --> 05:08.025
Huh? A new cafe?

05:08.069 --> 05:09.853
A medium cup of joe
would be perfect

05:09.897 --> 05:11.855
for this tall drink of water!

05:13.248 --> 05:14.510
All right!

05:14.553 --> 05:15.859
You're coming with me, sign!

05:15.903 --> 05:17.643
<i>♪ Coffee, coffee
For my tummy ♪</i>

05:17.687 --> 05:19.689
<i>♪ Yum, yum, yum, yummy</i>

05:19.732 --> 05:21.473
Hatchia matchiee!

05:21.517 --> 05:24.215
I'll have a "mac and roon."

05:24.259 --> 05:25.651
Gloria! Gloria!

05:25.695 --> 05:28.480
- We got a Code Keys!
- "Code Keys"?

05:29.003 --> 05:30.178
Gloria!

05:30.221 --> 05:31.788
I'm so sorry.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.878
But the cool thing now for
a cafe is to not have a sign!

05:34.922 --> 05:36.967
Well, if you say so...

05:37.011 --> 05:40.231
Oh, no!

05:41.058 --> 05:42.799
Huh. This place is locked.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.932
And I could've sworn
there was a sign here.

05:44.975 --> 05:46.629
What a mystery.

05:46.672 --> 05:48.892
A mystery too great
for even Officer Keys!

05:48.936 --> 05:51.895
Luckily, Detective Keys
is on the case!

05:51.939 --> 05:53.592
A-ha! A clue!

05:53.636 --> 05:57.205
Time to follow up
with this "Don and Dawn"...

05:57.248 --> 05:59.598
Gloria, aren't you gonna
let that customer in?

05:59.642 --> 06:01.774
No, no, no, this is all
a part of my theme!

06:01.818 --> 06:04.255
The door chains rattling
means its time for, uh...

06:04.299 --> 06:06.040
Everyone to listen up!

06:06.083 --> 06:09.565
Pay close attention as your
participation is mandatory!

06:09.608 --> 06:10.827
Now why'd you bring us down to

06:10.871 --> 06:12.524
one of our empty buildings?

06:12.568 --> 06:14.546
We're about to blow the lid
off the biggest mystery

06:14.570 --> 06:16.789
this town has ever seen!

06:16.833 --> 06:19.270
Ugh! We got out of
our jammies for this!

06:19.314 --> 06:21.838
Open sesame! Wha?!

06:21.882 --> 06:25.102
G-g-g-g-ghost café?!

06:25.146 --> 06:27.017
Oh, my goodness!

06:27.061 --> 06:29.498
This is embarrassing!
You two were right.

06:29.541 --> 06:32.414
A few spectral nuisances,
but nothing out of the ordinary.

06:32.457 --> 06:33.894
Get us out of here!

06:33.937 --> 06:36.461
Ha! You two got
cuddly all of a sudden!

06:36.505 --> 06:40.074
Hmm, there's still something
off about that place.

06:41.510 --> 06:42.467
Phew!

06:42.511 --> 06:43.512
All right, everybody,

06:43.947 --> 06:45.906
the interactive
ghost experience is over!

06:45.949 --> 06:48.343
Now I hope we <i>all</i> understand

06:48.386 --> 06:50.693
what it must have felt like
to be a ghost...

06:50.736 --> 06:52.782
in the French Revolution...

06:52.825 --> 06:54.044
I'm just gonna say it...

06:54.088 --> 06:56.394
This is a strange way
to run a café, right?

06:56.438 --> 06:57.961
Yes! I can't help
but feel like

06:58.005 --> 07:00.268
Gloria just doesn't know
what she's doing!

07:00.311 --> 07:01.660
- Told ya.
- Boy, howdy!

07:01.704 --> 07:03.227
I'd sure love a nice latte

07:03.271 --> 07:05.708
before I hit up
the cell phone store!

07:05.751 --> 07:06.796
Say, fellas,

07:06.839 --> 07:08.406
do you know where
a hipster like me

07:08.450 --> 07:09.538
could find one?

07:09.581 --> 07:10.539
You see? This is what I mean!

07:10.582 --> 07:12.106
We gotta help Gloria!

07:12.149 --> 07:13.629
Well, my good hipster,

07:13.672 --> 07:15.196
you've come to the right place.

07:15.239 --> 07:16.458
Hey there, Gloria!

07:16.501 --> 07:17.850
We found you a new customer!

07:17.894 --> 07:19.113
Ugh! Guys!

07:19.156 --> 07:20.592
Stop using the front door!

07:20.636 --> 07:23.291
Gloria, we're getting
a little concerned.

07:23.334 --> 07:24.988
All of this secrecy...

07:25.032 --> 07:27.121
How are customers supposed to
discover your café?

07:27.164 --> 07:29.732
It's fine! This is the way
I wanna do things!

07:29.775 --> 07:31.342
You. You wanted
coffee, right?

07:31.386 --> 07:34.389
- Oh! Yes!
- It's nothing personal, shug!

07:34.432 --> 07:35.738
We're just trying to give you

07:35.781 --> 07:37.348
a little push
in the right direction!

07:37.392 --> 07:39.829
After all, you worked so hard
to get that loan!

07:39.872 --> 07:40.743
But I didn't get it.

07:40.786 --> 07:42.136
What was that, Gloria?

07:42.179 --> 07:44.529
I said...
I didn't get the loan!

07:44.573 --> 07:46.183
What're you talking about?

07:46.227 --> 07:48.620
I tried to get approved
for the loan, but I failed!

07:48.664 --> 07:50.104
I was so worried
about letting you...

07:50.144 --> 07:52.494
no, letting <i>myself</i> down...

07:52.537 --> 07:54.365
that I risked opening
an illegal café

07:54.409 --> 07:55.801
because I thought that maybe

07:55.845 --> 07:57.586
if I succeeded
at this <i>one</i> thing,

07:57.629 --> 08:00.023
it would prove
I'm not a total loss

08:00.067 --> 08:01.285
Gloria...

08:01.329 --> 08:02.721
Oh, shug...

08:02.765 --> 08:04.027
Well, I'll be.

08:04.071 --> 08:05.681
What a crazy situation!

08:05.724 --> 08:09.293
And it was exactly
what I wanted to hear!

08:09.337 --> 08:10.599
Huh?

08:11.426 --> 08:12.818
Hmm?
Um?

08:13.689 --> 08:15.647
Officer Keys?!

08:15.691 --> 08:17.693
Yes! Undercover me!

08:17.736 --> 08:20.739
I knew something was off
about this <i>ghost</i> café...

08:20.783 --> 08:23.264
But I wasn't quite sure <i>what.</i>

08:23.307 --> 08:26.310
<i>We all know spirits love
abandoned buildings.</i>

08:26.354 --> 08:28.443
<i>And they love to drink coffee!</i>

08:28.486 --> 08:30.227
<i>Everything seemed to be
above board.</i>

08:30.271 --> 08:31.663
<i>But that's when it hit me!</i>

08:31.707 --> 08:33.491
If there's one thing
I know about ghosts...

08:33.535 --> 08:35.972
It's that they
love saying, "Boo!"

08:36.016 --> 08:37.974
And not a single "Boo"
was heard.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.584
Not even a little one!

08:39.628 --> 08:41.804
You would've gotten away
with it, too, Gloria,

08:41.847 --> 08:44.676
if it hadn't been
for a meddling <i>Keys!</i>

08:44.720 --> 08:46.939
And his partner Officer Cuffy.

08:47.984 --> 08:51.031
Woof. The number of times
I've parked on this street.

08:51.074 --> 08:53.511
Thanks for being
so cooperative, Gloria!

08:53.555 --> 08:55.644
The profits from your
illegal coffee stand

08:55.687 --> 08:57.472
were just about enough
to cover all the fines

08:57.515 --> 08:58.864
for your trespassing!

08:58.908 --> 09:00.040
Safe travels!

09:00.605 --> 09:02.694
Well that could've gone
a lot worse, right?

09:03.869 --> 09:05.480
I'll just drive now.

09:08.787 --> 09:11.486
There you are!
I got some words for you!

09:11.529 --> 09:13.401
I can take a guess.
You were right,

09:13.444 --> 09:14.682
and I don't have what it takes.

09:14.706 --> 09:16.795
Nice try, but you
need to hear this!

09:16.839 --> 09:17.883
Gramma!

09:17.927 --> 09:19.407
You lied to all the people

09:19.450 --> 09:20.601
who were tryin' to support ya,

09:20.625 --> 09:22.845
and you ended up
breaking the law!

09:22.888 --> 09:24.760
You couldn't take
no for an answer,

09:24.803 --> 09:26.588
put everything you had
on the line,

09:26.631 --> 09:29.678
and took a huge,
ridiculous risk!

09:29.721 --> 09:32.811
- Kind reminds me of myself.
- Sorry, what?

09:32.855 --> 09:35.249
Well, I probably wouldn't
have gone with the French theme.

09:35.292 --> 09:37.294
Or broken the law, right, Ma?

09:37.338 --> 09:38.687
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

09:38.730 --> 09:40.602
The point is that
I'm real impressed.

09:40.645 --> 09:43.039
It takes a lot of passion and
cleverness to run a business.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.173
And you've proven you got
the grit of a real Green.

09:46.216 --> 09:48.479
Which is why I wanna
make you an offer.

09:48.523 --> 09:51.700
- "Offer"?
- I got a bit of money squared
away for my retirement,

09:51.743 --> 09:54.790
and I'd like to use it
to invest in your business!

09:54.833 --> 09:56.420
Plus I can supply you
with some free labor.

09:56.444 --> 09:57.662
Heyyy!

09:57.706 --> 09:59.534
Alice... I...

09:59.577 --> 10:00.946
Well are ya just gonna
stand there sobbin'

10:00.970 --> 10:02.580
or are ya gonna make a deci...

10:02.624 --> 10:04.147
Thank you...

10:04.191 --> 10:07.063
All right, no need
to get mushy now.

10:08.804 --> 10:11.154
Feels good to be
doing things the right way.

10:11.198 --> 10:13.504
And what a great way
to help out Gloria.

10:13.548 --> 10:15.811
"Help Gloria"?
This ain't no charity!

10:15.854 --> 10:17.117
You hear that, missy?

10:17.595 --> 10:19.423
I expect to make all my money
back and more!

10:19.467 --> 10:20.598
Yes, ma'am!

10:20.642 --> 10:22.426
Ahh, working with Gloria again.

10:22.470 --> 10:24.167
You just don't mess
with a proven formula.

10:24.211 --> 10:26.952
Oh, hey, a new café!
You must be Gloria Green!

10:26.996 --> 10:28.911
No, it's Gloria <i>plus</i> Green.

10:28.954 --> 10:31.000
My name isn't... Oh, forget it.
