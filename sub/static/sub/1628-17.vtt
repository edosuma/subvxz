16:44.087 --> 16:45.918
I'm sorry, what exactly is it you want?

16:47.299 --> 16:48.584
Nothing you can give me.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.346
REGINA: Hello, Kurt?

16:57.434 --> 16:58.924
Mayor Mills.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.805
Good, you're still here.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.772
I would love to see Owen
before you leave.

17:05.942 --> 17:09.275
Would you two
like to come over for dinner tonight?

17:11.281 --> 17:12.691
Great.

17:22.584 --> 17:23.790
(SlGHS)

17:24.628 --> 17:25.868
(WHIMPERS) Where is it?

17:32.427 --> 17:33.542
(SNIFFLES)

17:35.805 --> 17:37.056
(SOBS)

17:37.140 --> 17:38.471
(SCREAMS)

17:41.645 --> 17:42.976
(SOBS)

17:57.744 --> 17:59.075
Thank you, Mommy.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.258
Well, it appears
we just missed our dear Queen.

18:15.387 --> 18:16.923
What is this?

18:20.392 --> 18:21.632
These are Cora's belongings.

18:21.726 --> 18:26.345
Looks like Regina's planning to use
one of her spells on Mary Margaret.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.021
Something's missing.

18:38.076 --> 18:41.068
Chimera blood, and viper's eye.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.069
And what kind of curse
do you need those for?

18:44.082 --> 18:45.822
It's the Curse of the Empty-Hearted.

18:45.917 --> 18:46.952
EMMA: What the hell does that do?

18:47.544 --> 18:49.580
In theory, it has the power
to make someone love you.

18:49.713 --> 18:52.455
Doesn't that break magic laws?

18:52.590 --> 18:56.048
You can't bring someone back to life.
You can't force someone to love you.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.798
Yeah, but this particular spell can
make someone think that they love you.

18:58.930 --> 19:03.219
And if you're as desperate for love
as Regina appears to be,

19:03.310 --> 19:04.800
you mightjust believe it.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.931
She's gonna use it on me, isn't she?

19:08.148 --> 19:09.137
(SlGHS)

19:09.232 --> 19:11.314
Hey, buddy,
why don't you go back upstairs?

19:11.401 --> 19:12.766
-Let us handle this.
-No!

19:13.486 --> 19:16.319
Emma, you said
you were gonna be honest with me.

19:16.406 --> 19:19.443
Now, why is Regina using this curse?

19:19.576 --> 19:22.534
Because it's the only way
she can get everything she wants,

19:22.620 --> 19:24.326
that she can get you.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.620
But if all she wants is me...

19:25.749 --> 19:28.832
Your mother is a complicated woman.
She wants your love, of course.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.661
But she also wants vengeance
on Mary Margaret.

19:33.465 --> 19:35.330
How does the curse give her both?

19:35.425 --> 19:37.962
Because the last ingredient she needs
to enact the curse

19:38.094 --> 19:39.959
is the heart of the person
she hates the most.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.090
You have to stop her.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.173
No, I don't have to do anything.

19:45.185 --> 19:49.269
On the contrary,
I believe warning you fulfills my debt.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.893
Not even close.
This is my wife's life we're talking about!

19:51.983 --> 19:53.689
Not to mention your grandson's.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.104
Yeah, well, wars have costs.

19:56.946 --> 19:57.901
Nice.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.230
Well, this is a blood feud, dearie.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.441
One that goes back
a very, very long time.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.241
And the only way
you can end a blood feud

20:04.329 --> 20:06.285
is by the spilling of more blood.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.656
That is the only way I know
to eliminate your Regina problem.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.784
By what? Killing her?

20:11.961 --> 20:14.373
Is there no other option?

20:14.464 --> 20:15.624
I'm afraid not.

20:15.799 --> 20:19.166
Stop! Listen to yourselves!

20:19.302 --> 20:22.135
You're talking about killing my mom.

20:22.222 --> 20:25.180
You used to be heroes.
What happened to you?

20:28.478 --> 20:29.467
EMMA: Henry.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.730
(SlGHS) No matter how this plays out,

20:34.818 --> 20:36.524
we need to keep him
as far away from it as possible.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.770
She's right.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.821
Cora was dangerous
because she didn't have a heart.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.493
Regina's even more dangerous
because she does.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.371
This is really delicious lasagna,
isn't it, Owen?

20:51.209 --> 20:52.198
Not really.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.125
Owen.

20:55.213 --> 20:58.250
It's okay.
I know I'm not the greatest cook.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.706
(CHUCKLES)

20:59.843 --> 21:01.504
Unless it involves apples.
(CHUCKLES)

21:03.263 --> 21:05.379
Speaking of which,

21:05.849 --> 21:09.341
how would you like to help me
make turnovers for dessert?

21:09.436 --> 21:11.893
There's a bunch of apples
sitting out in the sink.

21:12.689 --> 21:16.352
Why don't you go
pick out some good ones?

21:19.404 --> 21:21.019
(CHUCKLES)

21:23.908 --> 21:28.026
Owen is a bit of a free spirit.
He gets it from his mom.

21:28.204 --> 21:32.868
Is she back in New Jersey?
With the Boss.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.543
With the...

21:35.128 --> 21:36.459
She, uh...

21:38.381 --> 21:40.292
She passed away six months ago.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.214
I'm sorry.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.631
That's why I brought him here, actually.

21:45.722 --> 21:48.634
I thought that camping,
new surroundings,

21:48.725 --> 21:52.217
maybe that'd help him
take his mind off things, but...

21:56.774 --> 21:59.060
I came here looking to start over, too.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.403
It hasn't turned out
quite the way I'd hoped.

22:04.282 --> 22:05.442
Why not?

22:06.784 --> 22:09.696
What good's a new life if you don't
have anyone to share it with?

22:09.787 --> 22:11.914
OWEN: Hey,
I thought we were making dessert!

22:12.081 --> 22:13.287
(CHUCKLES)

22:20.757 --> 22:21.963
Voila.

22:23.426 --> 22:26.259
So, how come you're not a mom?

22:28.765 --> 22:31.131
Just didn't work out that way, I guess.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.224
That's too bad.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.098
You'd be really good at it.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.985
Thank you, Owen.

22:44.656 --> 22:45.645
So, how much longer?

22:45.949 --> 22:47.234
(CHUCKLES)

22:48.785 --> 22:51.071
Patience. They're almost done.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.541
And how are you liking
Storybrooke so far?

22:55.625 --> 22:58.082
lt's way better than New Jersey.

22:58.169 --> 23:01.252
You don't miss your home?
Your friends?

23:03.591 --> 23:05.047
I hate it there.

23:05.134 --> 23:08.501
All the kids at my school
treat me weird now.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.594
Because of what happened
to your mother?

23:14.018 --> 23:16.225
Nobody gets it. It's like...

23:16.312 --> 23:18.974
There's a piece of your heart missing?

23:23.945 --> 23:25.151
How's dessert coming?

23:26.698 --> 23:27.687
REGINA: Great.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.826
Owen and lwerejust talking, and,

23:32.161 --> 23:34.447
I know this might sound crazy,

23:34.539 --> 23:38.077
but how would you two feel

23:38.167 --> 23:41.625
about sticking around town
a little longer?

23:42.255 --> 23:44.962
Uh, "Stick around"? As in?

23:45.383 --> 23:47.169
Move here.

23:47.969 --> 23:52.588
I can get you a job with the city,
and there's a great school for Owen.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.385
Please, Dad. Can we?

23:54.559 --> 23:55.924
(CHUCKLES)

23:56.227 --> 23:58.684
It can be a chance for a new start.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.345
Uh...

24:01.858 --> 24:03.519
(INHALES SHARPLY)

24:05.653 --> 24:08.645
Look, I appreciate everything
you've done for us,

24:08.740 --> 24:11.527
but our life is in New Jersey.

24:12.702 --> 24:13.691
It's not here.

24:15.747 --> 24:17.203
Of course.

24:26.716 --> 24:31.176
Why did you bring me here?
I don't wanna talk to you.

24:32.221 --> 24:33.882
You don't have to.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.721
Hey, buddy! Saved you a seat.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.181
-l'm gonna get a coffee.
-Yeah.

24:39.228 --> 24:43.016
Here you go.
One large sundae, extra everything.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.688
Thanks, Ruby.

24:47.862 --> 24:49.272
Extra everything?

24:50.698 --> 24:51.653
What?

24:51.741 --> 24:54.824
You think I don't know a bribe
when I see one?

24:56.537 --> 24:57.617
(SlGHS)

24:57.705 --> 24:58.740
That obvious, huh?

25:00.249 --> 25:01.625
So, what do you want?

25:01.751 --> 25:04.868
Well, your mom told me
about what's been going on,

25:04.962 --> 25:06.213
and we thought that Storybrooke

25:06.297 --> 25:08.959
might not be the safest place
for you right now.

25:09.092 --> 25:12.255
So I was thinking,
why don't we go to New York?

25:12.387 --> 25:13.593
New York?

25:13.721 --> 25:16.633
Well, Regina can't cast that curse
if you're in New York.

25:16.766 --> 25:17.755
There's no magic there.

25:19.894 --> 25:22.010
Somebody should find a way
to get rid of magic here.

25:22.105 --> 25:24.721
My mom wouldn't be able
to cast the curse.

25:24.816 --> 25:28.149
My family wouldn't wanna kill her.
lt'd solve everything.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.983
Yeah, you know what? You're right.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.231
But until then,
why don't you come with me?

25:39.247 --> 25:40.703
Thanks, Ruby.

25:40.790 --> 25:41.870
Excuse me?

25:41.958 --> 25:44.165
Um, could I get this sandwich
wrapped up to go?

25:46.462 --> 25:47.622
A hike, huh?

25:47.755 --> 25:50.963
Well, Dr. Whale said it'd be good
for me to get on my feet.

25:51.092 --> 25:55.381
And, plus, I'm kind of
a nature photography nerd.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.471
| just thought you'd be back in
Pennsylvania by now.

25:58.641 --> 26:01.053
This town's starting to grow on me.

26:01.144 --> 26:02.930
Thank you very much.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.810
(DOOR CLOSES)

26:13.156 --> 26:14.646
How did it go?

26:14.741 --> 26:15.821
Went good, he said yes.

26:16.451 --> 26:17.486
Seriously?

26:17.618 --> 26:19.950
Yeah, he's in the bathroom
right now, just...

26:20.079 --> 26:21.819
Then we're gonna go home and pack.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.656
Not bad for day three as a dad,
if I do say so myself.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.907
Wait, where's his backpack?

26:27.420 --> 26:28.660
Well, ldon't know. He took it with him.

26:28.796 --> 26:30.502
To the bathroom?

26:30.590 --> 26:33.923
Did you really fall for that?
He's your son.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.676
He's running.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.213
Nice try, dearie.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.504
Did you really think
it was gonna be that easy?

27:17.678 --> 27:20.215
He can't be your guard dog forever.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.310
BILLY: So, what can I do to help,
Madame Mayor?

27:31.400 --> 27:33.061
Kurt Flynn's car.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.892
Yeah, the one you asked me to fix ASAP.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.569
Yes. Plans have changed.

27:37.698 --> 27:41.566
I now need Mr. Flynn and his son
to stay a while longer.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.903
Perhaps you can take
a couple extra days with the repairs?

27:45.039 --> 27:47.655
Yeah, I'm afraid that Mr. Flynn
already picked the car up.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.412
What? When?

27:51.087 --> 27:52.247
Ten minutes ago.

28:00.555 --> 28:04.423
Sheriff, our visitors
are driving out of Storybrooke.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.179
Find them before
they cross the town line,

28:07.270 --> 28:11.183
pull the car over,
and arrest the father for drunk driving.

28:11.274 --> 28:13.105
Then bring the boy to me.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.019
Kun?

28:19.282 --> 28:20.271
Mayor?

28:20.950 --> 28:24.033
That wasn't what it sounded like.

28:24.120 --> 28:28.705
I don't want any trouble.
ljust came by to say thank you, and...

28:28.791 --> 28:32.249
Wait, it was just a misunderstanding.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.791
No, I understood. We're leaving.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.959
I'm not going to hurt him.
Please don't leave.

28:38.092 --> 28:39.628
Whoa, mate, you're not going anywhere.

28:39.719 --> 28:40.708
What are you doing?

28:43.097 --> 28:45.133
I'm afraid you're under arrest
for driving under the influence.

28:45.224 --> 28:49.809
What, drunk? I'm not drunk,
and I sure as hell haven't been driving!

-Don't make this harder on yourself.

28:55.484 --> 28:58.146
I don't know how,
but she had this glowing thing.

28:58.321 --> 29:01.654
It was shaped like a heart.
Don't listen to her.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.239
And you say you haven't been drinking?

29:05.494 --> 29:06.825

-Hey, kid, you all right?

Boy Scout. Trying to get a merit badge.

What are you doing out here?

29:48.496 --> 29:49.986
l'm hiking.

29:50.498 --> 29:53.490
And I'm taking pictures
of Maine's scenic beauty.

30:23.656 --> 30:24.645
He was in here.

30:24.740 --> 30:27.117
NEAL: Why would an 11-year-old kid
run away to the mines?

30:27.201 --> 30:29.362
EMMA: Wouldn't be the first time.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.159
I think I know what he was looking for.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.488
The dynamite the dwarfs use
for blasting.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.959
What the hell
would he want dynamite for?

30:37.753 --> 30:39.163
To get rid of magic.

30:40.256 --> 30:41.496
Wait, what?

30:41.590 --> 30:43.126
At the diner, he said
someone should get rid of magic.
