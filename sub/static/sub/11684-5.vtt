WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:01.950
My name is Michael Westen.

00:01.951 --> 00:04.169
I used to be a spy until--

00:04.236 --> 00:05.370
We got a burn notice on you.

00:05.421 --> 00:07.305
You're blacklisted.

00:07.373 --> 00:09.424
When you're burned,
you've got nothing:

00:09.509 --> 00:11.977
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.044 --> 00:14.362
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.447 --> 00:15.714
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:15.782 --> 00:18.934
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.018 --> 00:21.103
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you:

00:22.238 --> 00:23.488
A trigger-happy girlfriend...

00:23.539 --> 00:24.906
Should we shoot them?

00:24.991 --> 00:27.209
An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:27.293 --> 00:28.210
You know spies.

00:28.294 --> 00:29.678
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.762 --> 00:30.962
Family too.

00:31.013 --> 00:31.847
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:31.931 --> 00:32.981
If you're desperate.

00:33.065 --> 00:33.865
Someone needs
your help, Michael.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.233
And a down-and-out spy

00:35.284 --> 00:36.901
you met along the way.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.470
That's how we do it,
people.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.139
Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,

00:41.190 --> 00:43.007
you're not going anywhere.

00:44.784 --> 00:45.784
It's a deep cover job.

00:45.835 --> 00:46.751
We're going after the leader

00:46.802 --> 00:48.619
of a terrorist network.

00:48.671 --> 00:51.055
You used to work
with this son of a bitch.

00:51.106 --> 00:52.357
You're on a path,
Michael.

00:52.424 --> 00:54.442
All will be revealed
in time.

00:54.527 --> 00:56.077
Two hour notice
to get to Cuba

00:56.162 --> 00:58.296
to bust somebody out
of a Russian black site?

00:58.364 --> 01:00.965
Can you take care of
the guards in here, get her out?

01:01.016 --> 01:02.267
She is all that matters.

01:02.334 --> 01:04.903
It's been an honor, Mike.

01:07.456 --> 01:08.573
Jesus.

01:10.509 --> 01:11.976
Where's Mike?

01:17.650 --> 01:20.552
She's still unconscious,
but--ahh!

01:20.619 --> 01:22.136
No, no, no--
Jesse?

01:22.221 --> 01:23.888
He's all right.
He's breathing.

01:23.956 --> 01:26.390
- She's gone.
- Mike, what do we do now?

01:26.442 --> 01:27.659
Find her.

01:43.275 --> 01:45.276
Tracking someone
in the wilderness

01:45.327 --> 01:46.995
isn't just about
the occasional footprint

01:47.079 --> 01:48.312
or broken branch.

01:48.364 --> 01:50.481
It's about using
what you find

01:50.549 --> 01:53.951
to put yourself in the head
of the person you're hunting.

01:56.405 --> 01:58.556
If your target
isn't completely careless,

01:58.607 --> 02:02.427
most signs you'll find
will be small, almost invisible.

02:02.494 --> 02:06.097
Just a bit of disturbed earth
or a bent branch.

02:06.165 --> 02:07.849
She didn't go east.
It's too dense.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.268
With all that mud,
it would lead us right to her.

02:10.318 --> 02:11.569
This way's a bust too.

02:11.620 --> 02:12.754
She'd have to circle around
to get through.

02:12.838 --> 02:14.589
Take a look at that.

02:14.673 --> 02:17.625
Of course, sometimes you do
find something more obvious,

02:17.710 --> 02:20.011
which makes the trail
that much easier to follow

02:20.078 --> 02:22.647
or that much harder.
Okay.

02:22.698 --> 02:25.867
Now we're on to something.

02:25.951 --> 02:28.986
Okay, check it out.
Looks like she fell right here.

02:29.038 --> 02:30.171
She's getting tired.

02:30.256 --> 02:31.289
She's probably
heading for the road.

02:31.340 --> 02:32.580
Come on, we can catch her.
Wait.

02:32.625 --> 02:33.758
Mike, we can't wait.

02:33.809 --> 02:34.926
Seriously,
she runs like a cheetah.

02:34.977 --> 02:36.394
If she gets to the road--

02:36.445 --> 02:37.862
Look at that.

02:37.913 --> 02:39.831
For two miles,
we don't see a footprint.

02:39.882 --> 02:41.916
Now she leaves tracks
a cub scout could follow?

02:42.001 --> 02:43.200
What are you saying?

02:43.252 --> 02:44.752
I'm saying
I think she's hiding.

02:44.837 --> 02:46.821
Waiting to double back
after we pass.

02:46.906 --> 02:48.072
Mike, we're talking
about someone

02:48.140 --> 02:48.973
who was just tortured
in a black site.

02:49.024 --> 02:50.141
She's still drugged up.

02:50.192 --> 02:51.492
I don't--
then look at that.

02:51.577 --> 02:53.494
The broken branch.

02:53.579 --> 02:55.597
If she went to the road,
who went that way?

02:55.681 --> 02:58.716
Oh, son of a bitch.

02:58.767 --> 03:01.603
I think she's behind us.
We should circle back.

03:01.687 --> 03:03.538
I got a better idea.
You circle back,

03:03.622 --> 03:06.124
Jesse and I keep going,
make her think she fooled us.

03:06.191 --> 03:07.675
Sell it.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.544
Well, there we go,
that branch.

03:09.628 --> 03:11.763
I think that's
the right way here.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.549
Yeah, I think
she's heading for the road.

03:22.908 --> 03:26.311
Drop it, now.

03:26.378 --> 03:28.146
Sonya, you don't
wanna do this.

03:28.213 --> 03:29.314
I'm on your side.

03:29.381 --> 03:32.383
I know who you are,
Michael Westen.

03:32.434 --> 03:35.820
Take off your laces now.

03:35.871 --> 03:38.957
Make a wrong move,
I'll shoot you.

03:39.024 --> 03:40.858
That's a nice trick,

03:40.909 --> 03:42.493
sending your friends
towards the road.

03:42.544 --> 03:45.029
You don't understand.
We're here to rescue you.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.531
Rescue me or take me
someplace worse.

03:47.583 --> 03:50.034
I know the Americans hate me
as much as the Russians do.

03:50.085 --> 03:51.169
I don't know what
you've heard about me,

03:51.220 --> 03:53.037
but that's the past.

03:53.088 --> 03:55.807
I no longer work
for the CIA.

03:55.874 --> 03:57.154
I was working
with Randall Burke.

03:57.209 --> 03:58.760
You worked with Randall?

03:58.844 --> 04:01.512
He found me drinking myself
to death in Santo Domingo.

04:01.563 --> 04:03.014
He cleaned me up.

04:03.065 --> 04:05.266
He gave me a job.

04:05.351 --> 04:07.318
We found the man
who sold you to the Russians,

04:07.386 --> 04:09.437
and then we came after you.

04:09.521 --> 04:12.223
You keep saying "we,"
but I don't see Randall.

04:12.274 --> 04:15.109
Where is he?

04:18.730 --> 04:20.498
He didn't make it out.

04:20.565 --> 04:22.917
He sacrificed himself
to save you.

04:23.002 --> 04:24.252
He's gone.
I'm sorry.

04:24.336 --> 04:26.004
He's dead?

04:26.071 --> 04:27.705
That's convenient for you,
isn't it?

04:27.756 --> 04:29.340
My friend is dead,

04:29.408 --> 04:30.792
and the three of you
can tell any story you want.

04:30.876 --> 04:32.043
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

04:32.094 --> 04:34.045
He was my friend too--

04:34.096 --> 04:37.598
he was more than a friend.
He saved me.

04:37.683 --> 04:40.418
Now I don't have any proof
to offer you,

04:40.469 --> 04:42.887
but I know why I'm here--
because Burke gave me a purpose.

04:42.938 --> 04:44.305
He said I was part
of something,

04:44.390 --> 04:48.359
that I was on a path,
and I chose to believe him.

04:50.095 --> 04:54.932
Now the question is whether
you choose to believe me.

05:07.134 --> 05:08.185
"Hey, Sam and Jesse.

05:08.769 --> 05:09.769
Feel like coming down
to Cuba?"

05:09.820 --> 05:11.804
"Sure, Mike, sounds great.

05:11.855 --> 05:13.375
"Hope we get to hike
through the woods.

05:13.407 --> 05:14.958
Forever."
Not forever, Sam.

05:15.042 --> 05:16.376
The boat should
be just up ahead.

05:16.443 --> 05:18.211
Yeah, assuming
it's still there.

05:18.278 --> 05:20.096
We lost a lot of time
on that little detour.

05:20.180 --> 05:21.347
Hold on.

05:21.398 --> 05:23.416
Looks like the Cuban police
showed up.

05:23.484 --> 05:25.284
Well, I guess the good news
is the boat is still there.

05:25.336 --> 05:27.770
We just can't get to it.

05:27.855 --> 05:29.105
We still have some C4.

05:29.189 --> 05:31.207
We could give the cops
something to investigate,

05:31.292 --> 05:34.344
make it over to the seawall,
and swim for the boat.

05:34.428 --> 05:35.628
Even if we
get past the police,

05:35.646 --> 05:37.063
they've already called in
their position.

05:37.114 --> 05:39.048
Cuban gunships are probably
headed here already.

05:39.133 --> 05:40.433
Burke left you
some clothes.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.801
We could drive up
the coastline,

05:41.852 --> 05:43.236
try to get ahead
of the manhunt.

05:43.304 --> 05:44.603
It won't matter.

05:44.655 --> 05:46.005
They're going to lock down
the entire island.

05:46.073 --> 05:47.707
So I guess your proposal
is to what,

05:47.758 --> 05:51.143
live in the Cuban wilderness
for the rest of our lives?

05:51.195 --> 05:52.879
There's a smuggler I know.

05:52.946 --> 05:54.380
Ruben Hernandez.

05:54.431 --> 05:56.099
He has a cigar shop on
the southern edge of Havana.

05:56.183 --> 05:58.534
He runs guns in and out
of every port in the Caribbean.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.086
Does he move people
as well?

06:00.153 --> 06:03.439
Not usually,
but I can be persuasive.

06:11.531 --> 06:14.834
Okay, it looks like that place
has been closed for years,

06:14.885 --> 06:18.171
so her friend could be dead
or in prison--

06:18.238 --> 06:20.006
Or Sonya's leading us
into a trap.

06:20.073 --> 06:21.207
I know she whacked you
on the head.

06:21.258 --> 06:23.026
No, it's not that--
I mean...

06:23.110 --> 06:24.350
That pissed me off
a little bit.

06:24.395 --> 06:26.145
I'm not gonna lie.
That pissed me off.

06:26.196 --> 06:28.781
But listen, when I was in CIFA,
there was a rumor

06:28.849 --> 06:31.267
about a deep cover Russian mole
working around Arlington.

06:31.352 --> 06:34.320
Blonde hair, in her 20s,
spoke flawless English.

06:34.371 --> 06:35.955
Wait a minute,
I heard about her.

06:36.006 --> 06:37.290
She turned the NSA
inside out.

06:37.341 --> 06:38.708
Yeah, and the information
she sent home

06:38.792 --> 06:39.859
got a lot of good agents
killed.

06:39.927 --> 06:41.594
Now if Sonya's
that operative,

06:41.662 --> 06:43.663
it's only a matter of time
before she stabs us in the back.

06:43.731 --> 06:45.465
Well, then we
won't turn our backs.

06:45.532 --> 06:46.966
Mike, you know what,
maybe it's best

06:47.017 --> 06:48.768
that we just shove her
in the trunk of a car

06:48.819 --> 06:50.520
and call the CIA...
Amen to that.

06:50.604 --> 06:51.604
'Cause I'll tell you
one thing,

06:51.655 --> 06:52.672
the Russians
didn't throw her

06:52.740 --> 06:53.790
in a black site
for shoplifting.

06:53.874 --> 06:55.074
That's not
how this works, Sam.

06:55.142 --> 06:56.542
My mission isn't
to grab one person,

06:56.610 --> 06:58.227
it's to take down
a terrorist network,

06:58.312 --> 07:01.114
and right, now she is
the only link to that network.

07:01.165 --> 07:03.315
Now if you guys want out,
I understand,

07:03.367 --> 07:05.751
but I have to see this through
one way or another.

07:05.803 --> 07:08.271
No, we're in, but after
this is over, Mike,

07:08.355 --> 07:10.823
I want a thank-you note
from the CIA director.

07:10.891 --> 07:13.593
And a fruit basket.

07:13.660 --> 07:14.700
Ruben's still in business.

07:14.728 --> 07:15.849
He'll be here
this afternoon.

07:15.896 --> 07:17.497
Sam, Jesse,
switch out this car

07:17.564 --> 07:18.614
before the police find it.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.366
Michael and I
will wait inside.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.034
Mike, you sure
you wanna split up?

07:22.086 --> 07:23.753
Because if you guys
are seen...

07:23.837 --> 07:26.305
We'll keep a low profile.

07:26.356 --> 07:29.125
It'll be fine, Sam.

07:31.795 --> 07:32.711
Shotgun.

07:38.001 --> 07:41.487
When you've spent too much
time working with spies,

07:41.538 --> 07:43.206
trust doesn't come easy.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.641
Even when you're dealing
with someone you care about,

07:45.726 --> 07:48.060
you're always on the lookout
for signs of deception.

07:48.112 --> 07:49.746
Because you never know

07:49.830 --> 07:51.364
whether you're just
spotting white lies...

07:52.666 --> 07:54.050
or something darker.

07:56.336 --> 07:59.522
What's up?
That's what I wanna know.

07:59.606 --> 08:00.456
What are you talking about?

08:00.541 --> 08:02.208
Why did you tell Lou

08:02.275 --> 08:03.392
we'd take this job
in New Orleans?

08:03.477 --> 08:04.560
The money's not good,

08:04.645 --> 08:07.063
and the trail is two days old.

08:07.147 --> 08:08.614
No, it's not.

08:08.665 --> 08:09.916
Lou just--
Don't lie to me!

08:09.983 --> 08:13.586
- Whoa, whoa.
- I will not be lied to.

08:13.637 --> 08:15.438
No secrets.

08:15.522 --> 08:17.790
Fi...

08:17.858 --> 08:21.010
I-I wasn't lying about anything.
Okay?

08:21.095 --> 08:23.930
I just didn't tell you
the whole story.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.598
Here's the deal.

08:25.649 --> 08:27.984
Ever since Michael came back
you've had this, you know,

08:28.068 --> 08:30.036
this different look
in your eye.

08:30.104 --> 08:32.889
So I figured, I don't know,
trip away for a few days

08:32.972 --> 08:34.774
might help clear your head.

08:34.842 --> 08:36.442
That's all.

08:40.147 --> 08:43.065
It's just when I walked up
you--you hung up your phone.

08:43.150 --> 08:44.049
I was just making
hotel reservations.

08:44.101 --> 08:46.869
You wanna check my phone?

08:48.839 --> 08:51.624
Come on a trip with me.

08:51.675 --> 08:52.625
A few days.

08:52.676 --> 08:56.078
It'll be fun.

08:56.163 --> 08:58.097
Just how much fun?

08:59.466 --> 09:01.567
Lots of fun.

09:05.189 --> 09:06.805
Well, it's just
for a couple of weeks.

09:06.857 --> 09:08.791
Will you and Charlie be okay?

09:08.876 --> 09:10.076
I'm sure, Fiona.

09:10.127 --> 09:11.688
As long as you're here
for his birthday.

09:11.712 --> 09:14.113
We're doing dinosaurs
and trains.

09:15.983 --> 09:18.717
Madeline, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

09:28.462 --> 09:31.297
I didn't see anything in your
file about being a painter,

09:31.365 --> 09:34.016
but I gotta tell you,
this is impressive.

09:34.101 --> 09:35.635
What do you call it?

09:35.686 --> 09:38.404
I call it
"Shoot intruders on sight."

09:38.455 --> 09:40.456
It explores my feelings

09:40.541 --> 09:43.759
about having the CIA break
into my house repeatedly.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.811
Hmm, I was expecting something
a little bit more whimsical.

09:45.879 --> 09:46.946
Get out.

09:47.014 --> 09:48.831
Look, I'll be happy to leave,

09:48.916 --> 09:51.467
but we have to talk first.

09:51.552 --> 09:54.120
I've heard that you're thinking
about getting out of town.

09:54.187 --> 09:55.988
Oh, you're spying on me too.

09:56.039 --> 09:58.624
If by "spying" you mean
monitoring my operative's

09:58.692 --> 10:00.526
closest known associates,
then yes.

10:00.594 --> 10:02.061
Look, here's the deal.

10:02.129 --> 10:04.914
This is a very crucial point
for Michael in his mission.

10:04.998 --> 10:07.133
He's gonna need all the help
he can get going forward.

10:07.184 --> 10:08.467
I need you here.

10:08.535 --> 10:10.369
I don't care what you need.

10:10.437 --> 10:12.822
I don't wanna be involved.

10:12.906 --> 10:14.790
You already are involved.

10:14.875 --> 10:18.060
You kidnapped a Russian
diplomat, for God's sake.

10:18.145 --> 10:20.763
Yeah, well that was for
Michael, not the CIA.

10:20.847 --> 10:22.615
And it was a one-time favor.

10:22.666 --> 10:24.417
You know that, I know that.

10:24.484 --> 10:26.619
The people he's chasing don't.

10:26.670 --> 10:29.822
They think that you're one of
Michael's top assets in Miami.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.440
You're part of his cover now.

10:31.525 --> 10:35.527
Which means we can use you when
Michael comes back to Miami.

10:35.579 --> 10:38.014
Too bad.
I'm not interested.

10:38.098 --> 10:40.683
Get interested.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.535
This is a matter
of national security.

10:42.602 --> 10:47.173
I was hoping that you would
just help us out voluntarily,

10:47.241 --> 10:49.909
but you don't
really have a choice.

10:51.995 --> 10:53.496
You let yourself in.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.114
You can let yourself out.

10:55.165 --> 10:57.049
I have a trip to shop for.

10:57.117 --> 10:59.068
You can't just walk away
from this, Ms. Glenanne.

10:59.152 --> 11:00.886
No?
Watch me.

11:06.493 --> 11:08.261
Forget about it.

11:08.328 --> 11:09.962
They're not letting
even a pineapple

11:10.013 --> 11:12.365
leave the ports without
inspection tonight, all right?

11:12.432 --> 11:14.200
Smuggling four people?

11:14.268 --> 11:15.401
<i>Imposible.</i>

11:15.469 --> 11:16.769
You must have other avenues

11:16.837 --> 11:19.272
out of the country
or other contacts.

11:19.339 --> 11:21.857
Ruben, I want you to remember
a few years back

11:21.942 --> 11:23.626
when U.S. customs somehow

11:23.710 --> 11:26.095
overlooked those shipments
into San Juan.

11:26.179 --> 11:28.881
It happened
because I helped you.

11:28.949 --> 11:31.817
If I decide to hurt you,
things will go differently.

11:31.868 --> 11:34.687
Very differently.

11:38.759 --> 11:40.393
Okay, listen.

11:40.460 --> 11:43.462
There's a freighter
leaving the port tonight.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.132
The cargo's already been loaded.

11:46.183 --> 11:49.535
- If and this is a big if--
- Make it happen.

11:51.738 --> 11:54.040
We might have to put
that escape plan on hold.

11:54.091 --> 11:56.342
Look.

11:57.894 --> 11:59.028
Cops are here.

11:59.112 --> 12:00.033
Those aren't just cops.

12:00.063 --> 12:02.915
That's state security.

12:04.918 --> 12:06.686
Oi, oi, no, no, no, no.

12:06.753 --> 12:08.154
No, not that way.

12:08.221 --> 12:09.522
If you break the window,
they'll know you're here.

12:09.573 --> 12:12.041
I have a hidden room in here.

12:29.743 --> 12:31.711
<i>Buenas.</i>

12:31.778 --> 12:33.963
Mind if we speak English?

12:34.047 --> 12:36.599
My Spanish is not so good.

12:36.683 --> 12:38.884
Of course, of course,
uh, señora...

12:38.935 --> 12:42.488
Colonel Oksana Zhirkov
of the Russian GRU.

12:42.556 --> 12:44.123
Oksana.

12:44.191 --> 12:47.059
She's been after me
since I left Moscow.

12:47.127 --> 12:51.180
We are looking for a woman
you worked with a few years ago.

12:51.264 --> 12:53.999
Sonya Lebedenko.
Sonya?

12:54.067 --> 12:57.069
<i>Si,</i> Sonya, but I haven't
seen Sonya in a long time.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.755
Wasn't she headed
back to Russia?

12:59.840 --> 13:01.757
No, no, no,
give Ruben a chance

13:01.842 --> 13:03.559
to talk his way out of it.
He's good.

13:03.643 --> 13:05.561
This is just in case
she's better.

13:05.645 --> 13:07.997
She is in Cuba
with an American.

13:08.081 --> 13:10.049
They're looking
to get off the island.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.051
Given your past together,

13:12.102 --> 13:14.186
I figure this would be
her first stop.

13:14.254 --> 13:15.921
She's a clever girl.

13:15.972 --> 13:18.107
I'm sure she expected you
to come to me as well

13:18.191 --> 13:20.209
and stayed away.

13:20.293 --> 13:22.795
Or perhaps they did come here
without your knowledge?

13:22.846 --> 13:25.481
They could have
hidden in a crate

13:25.565 --> 13:26.932
due to be shipped out soon.

13:26.983 --> 13:28.484
I doubt that very much

13:28.568 --> 13:31.170
because nobody comes into my
warehouse without me knowing.

13:31.237 --> 13:33.205
I trust you, señor,
but do you mind

13:33.256 --> 13:34.607
if my men look around a bit?

13:34.674 --> 13:35.691
No, no, of course not.

13:58.148 --> 14:00.533
You seem nervous.

14:00.584 --> 14:03.068
No, it's--it's just
the merchandise here

14:03.120 --> 14:04.587
is very valuable.

14:04.671 --> 14:06.472
I'm sure.

14:09.576 --> 14:10.476
Tell me something.

14:10.527 --> 14:12.578
You know Sonya.

14:12.645 --> 14:16.048
If she didn't come here,
where would she go?

14:16.116 --> 14:18.584
When she was in Havana,

14:18.652 --> 14:22.655
she, uh...she knew this guy
at Marina Tarara.

14:22.706 --> 14:24.206
It's east of the city.

14:24.291 --> 14:25.791
A lot of pleasure yachts
dock there.

14:25.859 --> 14:28.828
Do you remember the contact's
name at the Marina?

14:28.895 --> 14:31.897
Eh, Eduardo.

14:31.965 --> 14:34.133
He--he would rent boats
to tourists.

14:38.121 --> 14:39.555
All right.

14:39.639 --> 14:41.540
You've been very helpful.

14:41.591 --> 14:42.975
We'll be on our way.

14:43.042 --> 14:44.810
If I hear anything
I'll contact you.

14:44.878 --> 14:48.113
But please, uh, Colonel,
please take this.

14:48.165 --> 14:49.915
For you.
Thank you.

14:56.590 --> 15:00.159
One more thing,
Señor Hernandez.

15:02.062 --> 15:05.247
I noticed something interesting
while we were talking.

15:05.332 --> 15:08.066
Whenever my associates
walked near that wall

15:08.118 --> 15:10.769
you completely forgot
about your cigar.

15:10.837 --> 15:13.639
In fact, you held your breath.

15:13.690 --> 15:16.358
I wonder why a weapons smuggler

15:16.443 --> 15:18.444
would have a warehouse
with no weapons.

15:18.512 --> 15:20.913
It occurs to me a hidden room

15:20.964 --> 15:26.502
would be very convenient
for hiding guns or people.

15:26.586 --> 15:28.187
Or I just sent a shipment out,

15:28.238 --> 15:31.090
and for the moment
I only have cigars.

15:31.157 --> 15:34.210
Lying is such hard work.

15:34.294 --> 15:36.629
And it's pointless now.

15:36.696 --> 15:41.000
Just tell me the truth,
and this will all be over.

15:41.051 --> 15:44.904
Where is the hidden door?

15:51.077 --> 15:52.811
It's the middle panel.

15:52.862 --> 15:54.496
There's a little latch
on the bottom.

15:54.581 --> 15:57.249
Thank you.

16:02.756 --> 16:05.157
They're behind the wall.
I want them alive.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.658
Move.

16:17.354 --> 16:19.054
Run!

16:32.986 --> 16:34.820
Cover me.

16:41.861 --> 16:43.695
Go.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.186
How's it look out there?

17:02.270 --> 17:03.654
Oh, you know.

17:03.738 --> 17:06.290
Classic cars, good music,
crumbling infrastructure.

17:06.374 --> 17:09.660
Oh, and you two are the stars
of a nationwide manhunt.

17:09.743 --> 17:11.829
Yeah, airports sealed off.

17:11.913 --> 17:13.464
Ports are locked up tight.

17:13.548 --> 17:15.382
Even the hotels
are doing room checks.

17:15.433 --> 17:17.685
Oksana is the agency's best.

17:17.752 --> 17:20.753
Back when I knew her, an
MI6 agent was made in Estonia.

17:20.805 --> 17:22.772
He had a two-day head start
to get out of the country.

17:22.857 --> 17:25.392
Oksana found and killed him
by dinnertime.

17:25.443 --> 17:28.579
There might
be one card we can play.

17:28.663 --> 17:30.898
She hasn't seen me
and Jesse yet.

17:30.965 --> 17:32.799
Maybe we can approach her.
That could work.

17:32.851 --> 17:33.934
We tell her we're hunting
for Mike.

17:33.985 --> 17:35.106
Pitch her on joining forces.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.036
If we can get her to show us

17:36.104 --> 17:37.338
where she's deploying her men,

17:37.405 --> 17:38.672
maybe we can find a hole.
Or create one.

17:38.740 --> 17:40.040
You still have the bug
we used at the black site?

17:40.091 --> 17:41.091
Yeah, I'll just
put it in my watch.

17:41.176 --> 17:42.643
You two are going to walk

17:42.710 --> 17:45.979
into Oksana's headquarters
and lie to her?

17:46.031 --> 17:47.281
Pretty much, yeah.

17:47.349 --> 17:48.632
Let me remind you,

17:48.717 --> 17:51.385
she is the head of
counterintelligence for the GRU.

17:51.436 --> 17:53.553
There's no one better at seeing
through tricks like this.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.406
I know a little bit about
counterintelligence myself.

17:55.490 --> 17:56.824
You don't know Oksana.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.042
You make one wrong move,

17:58.126 --> 17:59.627
and she kills you
and captures us.

17:59.694 --> 18:02.596
Sonya, you saw Oksana
at the warehouse yesterday.

18:02.647 --> 18:04.365
She's reading right out
of your playbook.

18:04.432 --> 18:07.584
If we just try to run, how long
do you think we'll last?

18:07.669 --> 18:09.569
Sending Sam and Jesse in
might be dangerous,

18:09.621 --> 18:11.872
but right now
it's the best move we have.

18:11.923 --> 18:13.357
All right,
keep your heads down.

18:13.441 --> 18:15.776
Let's see what we can do.

18:23.418 --> 18:26.053
When you're trying
to escape surveillance,

18:26.104 --> 18:28.656
the first step is spotting it.

18:28.707 --> 18:31.842
You're on the lookout for people
who won't make eye contact,

18:31.926 --> 18:34.762
figures sitting
in parked cars,

18:34.813 --> 18:37.481
or faces you've seen
more than once.

18:37.565 --> 18:39.900
If you can't determine
how you're being watched,

18:39.951 --> 18:43.304
the best move is to change
locations as soon as possible.

18:43.371 --> 18:45.856
- You all set?
- Yeah.

18:45.940 --> 18:47.441
You okay?
What's wrong?

18:47.508 --> 18:49.843
Nothing, I'm just looking
forward to our trip.

18:49.894 --> 18:50.728
Yeah, me too.

18:50.812 --> 18:51.845
Let's get on the road.

18:51.913 --> 18:52.946
Of course, sometimes

18:52.998 --> 18:54.498
the reason you can't figure out

18:54.582 --> 18:56.884
how they're watching
is that they're done watching.

18:56.935 --> 18:58.635
Fiona Glenanne,
you're under arrest.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.554
What the hell?
What are you talking about?

19:00.605 --> 19:01.772
Un--under arrest for what?

19:01.856 --> 19:03.357
Two counts
of criminal trespassing.

19:03.424 --> 19:05.492
1712 Laguna Way.
What-are you kidding me?

19:05.543 --> 19:07.161
We're chasing
a bail jumper, man.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.829
We work for these guys.
No, it's not what you think.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.214
Well, it looks like your
girlfriend cut some corners--

19:10.298 --> 19:12.649
No, no, no, no.
Let me tell you something, okay?

19:12.734 --> 19:14.814
I was there for that takedown.
She did nothing wrong.

19:14.819 --> 19:16.737
You want to arrest somebody,
you arrest me.

19:16.788 --> 19:18.572
I'll be happy to take you two,
if that's what you want.

19:18.623 --> 19:21.375
Carlos, you don't wanna
get involved in this.

19:21.426 --> 19:22.192
Okay?
Come on.

19:24.779 --> 19:26.980
Hey, this--this has got
to be some kinda mistake, okay?

19:27.032 --> 19:28.449
It's gonna be fine, I promise.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.334
Let's go.

19:33.321 --> 19:35.105
See ya in a bit, okay?

19:39.778 --> 19:41.829
Russia and Cuba
aren't as tight as they were

19:41.896 --> 19:44.398
in the Cold War, but their
law enforcement agencies

19:44.449 --> 19:46.383
still cooperate closely.

19:46.468 --> 19:48.034
If you're looking
for a Russian officer

19:48.086 --> 19:50.421
running a manhunt in Havana,
there's a good chance

19:50.505 --> 19:52.973
they're operating out of
a local police station.

19:53.024 --> 19:55.309
Which means the problem
isn't finding them.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.444
It's that they'll have
an entire country's resources

19:57.512 --> 19:58.645
at their disposal.

20:13.211 --> 20:15.095
Sorry to keep you waiting,
gentlemen.

20:15.146 --> 20:17.297
I'm Colonel Oksana Zhirkov.

20:17.348 --> 20:20.267
My men found the abandoned sedan
that you reported.

20:20.318 --> 20:22.953
Thank you.
No problem.

20:23.037 --> 20:24.621
That car's
not all we can find.

20:24.706 --> 20:26.106
My name's Chuck Finley.

20:26.174 --> 20:27.874
This is my partner,
Virgil Tibbs.

20:27.926 --> 20:29.226
We're bounty hunters.

20:29.310 --> 20:30.177
If there's money
on someone's head,

20:30.228 --> 20:31.829
we track down that head.

20:31.913 --> 20:33.647
We're currently after
one Michael Westen.

20:33.698 --> 20:35.382
I know
who Michael Westen is.

20:35.450 --> 20:36.884
Good. Then you know
he's on the run

20:36.951 --> 20:38.285
with someone you're after.

20:38.336 --> 20:39.753
Sonya Lebedenko?

20:39.804 --> 20:42.906
We're thinking we team up,
help each other out.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.725
I see.
Very interesting.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.377
What other information
do you have?

20:47.462 --> 20:48.846
We're gathering information
all the time.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.347
Just this morning
we tracked down

20:50.432 --> 20:51.849
one of their
discarded burner cells,

20:51.933 --> 20:53.494
found some of the places
they've stayed.

20:53.501 --> 20:56.069
So in other words...
You have nothing.

20:56.121 --> 20:57.070
Excuse me?

20:57.122 --> 20:58.589
You have no useful leads.

20:58.673 --> 21:00.140
No real chance of catching them.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.776
I didn't fly in from Moscow
to do your job for you.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.194
What? No.

21:04.279 --> 21:06.079
No, no, no,
that's not it at all.

21:06.131 --> 21:08.132
See, we've been nipping
at Westen's heels.

21:08.216 --> 21:09.500
We know how he thinks.

21:09.584 --> 21:12.385
I'm sure you do.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.955
My associate will take down
anything else you have to say.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.543
Okay, listen, my Russian
might be a little rusty,

21:19.627 --> 21:21.507
but it sounds like
you're having us worked over.

21:21.529 --> 21:22.779
Call it what you like.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.364
I told you
this was a bad idea.

21:24.415 --> 21:25.899
- Whoa!
- Give me your phone.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.501
- Have you lost your mind?
- You can't just lock us up!

21:27.552 --> 21:28.969
Hold on, that's my phone.

21:29.036 --> 21:30.237
That's my phone.

21:30.304 --> 21:31.137
That could be information
about Westen.

21:32.440 --> 21:33.774
Are you really
gonna pass up a lead?

21:33.825 --> 21:36.543
Let the man answer his phone.

22:12.647 --> 22:14.114
Well, let's hear it.

22:14.182 --> 22:16.200
Oh, now you wanna chat?

22:16.284 --> 22:18.202
Now she wants to chat.

22:18.286 --> 22:20.954
I'm not saying a damn thing
until your buddies back off.

22:21.005 --> 22:23.590
You're bluffing.

22:23.658 --> 22:26.493
There's no way you found
something my men didn't.

22:26.544 --> 22:27.978
I have all the police
in the region.

22:28.062 --> 22:30.147
Well, we have sources
that won't talk to the police,

22:30.231 --> 22:32.432
folks who aren't fans
of the current regime.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.780
Folks who are helping
Westen run.

22:33.835 --> 22:36.119
Exactly. We got
a whole network out there,

22:36.204 --> 22:38.972
and if you want to take
advantage of it, no more goons.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.891
We're partners
on this manhunt.

22:40.975 --> 22:43.310
Fine.

22:43.361 --> 22:45.862
If you offer me
something useful,

22:45.947 --> 22:48.699
I will allow you to assist
with our investigation.

22:51.285 --> 22:52.586
Okay, then.

22:52.637 --> 22:54.688
Michael and Sonya were spotted
at a bodega in Miramar.

22:54.755 --> 22:57.925
Our guy followed them down
the road to an abandoned bunker.

22:57.992 --> 22:59.943
Oh, oh, uh, wow.

23:00.028 --> 23:01.828
Are you sure?
Yep.

23:01.896 --> 23:03.463
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

23:03.531 --> 23:04.748
I'm sure.

23:04.832 --> 23:05.966
Avenida allende.

23:06.033 --> 23:07.217
Right outside of town.

23:18.446 --> 23:20.347
They'll be here
in about five minutes.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.316
Tell me you have a way
to block off this road.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.334
I'm working on it.

23:24.419 --> 23:27.170
If you need to create
a roadblock in a hurry,

23:27.255 --> 23:30.374
the steel frames of old cars
make an excellent barrier.

23:30.458 --> 23:34.327
The challenge is moving that
much metal without a tow truck.

23:34.379 --> 23:36.680
What you need
is a directed explosion.

23:36.764 --> 23:39.399
If you make sure that
the shockwave from your C4

23:39.467 --> 23:41.618
can't head down or sideways,

23:41.703 --> 23:45.105
the only way it can go is up.

23:46.607 --> 23:48.659
You said five minutes.

23:48.743 --> 23:49.993
They drove fast.

23:50.078 --> 23:51.328
Let's go!

23:51.412 --> 23:52.996
And the more contained
the blast,

23:53.081 --> 23:54.965
the higher it will send
a car flying.

24:05.176 --> 24:06.459
There's no way
you're gonna get the--

24:14.124 --> 24:15.875
I stand corrected.

24:18.410 --> 24:20.047
As a spy,
there's nothing better

24:20.048 --> 24:22.040
than gaining access
to your enemy's war room.

24:23.067 --> 24:25.168
You can identify
their weaknesses,

24:25.252 --> 24:27.170
see where they're
deploying their forces,

24:27.254 --> 24:29.122
and if you play
your cards right,

24:29.190 --> 24:31.941
you can even create an
escape route for your friends.

24:32.026 --> 24:33.993
So everything else seems
pretty much locked down tight,

24:34.061 --> 24:36.379
but the airport concerns me.

24:36.464 --> 24:39.349
Now look, if we double up
at the VIP entrance

24:39.433 --> 24:40.934
and the employee entrance...
Yeah.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.569
You might have
a fighting chance there.

24:42.636 --> 24:43.970
No.

24:44.038 --> 24:45.538
I'm not going to play
a guessing game

24:45.606 --> 24:48.675
and risk giving Sonya and Westen
a clear path onto the tarmac.

24:48.743 --> 24:51.978
The airport is secure.

24:52.029 --> 24:54.697
Okay.

24:54.782 --> 24:56.199
Uh, whoa!

24:56.283 --> 24:58.251
Whoa, are those fuel trucks?

24:58.318 --> 24:59.786
Completely unguarded?

24:59.854 --> 25:01.688
Oh, you've seen
Westen in action.

25:01.755 --> 25:04.023
You're basically giving him
a pack of matches here.

25:04.091 --> 25:05.909
I can't devote manpower

25:05.993 --> 25:08.077
to guarding fuel trucks
the entire day.

25:08.162 --> 25:09.662
There's no way
he could even reach them.

25:09.713 --> 25:10.880
He wouldn't have to.

25:10.965 --> 25:11.765
He could just put
an old car in drive

25:11.832 --> 25:13.266
and send it in like a missile.

25:13.317 --> 25:16.953
Or...you borrow some guards
from the perimeter here.

25:17.037 --> 25:19.005
Have 'em hide behind
the trucks, rifles ready.

25:19.072 --> 25:20.774
Sonya and Westen go anywhere
near those trucks,

25:20.841 --> 25:23.843
it's game over.

25:23.894 --> 25:26.746
Fine, we will move some men.

25:33.754 --> 25:35.321
Three policemen
off the perimeter.

25:35.389 --> 25:36.906
That doesn't help us.

25:36.991 --> 25:39.375
Planes are still heavily guarded
and there's no path to them

25:39.460 --> 25:41.461
that doesn't get us cut down
from three directions.

25:41.512 --> 25:43.353
Then we don't head
to the planes on the tarmac.

25:43.430 --> 25:45.098
We try to make it over
to the hangar there

25:45.149 --> 25:47.567
where there's
only a single guard.

25:47.618 --> 25:49.002
I assume you know
that "mantenimiento"

25:49.069 --> 25:50.203
means maintenance.

25:50.254 --> 25:51.638
We'll find
something flyable.

25:51.705 --> 25:52.872
A plane that needs
a little work

25:52.923 --> 25:55.675
might be our only option
right now.

25:55.726 --> 25:56.893
And how are we going
to cross that open field

25:56.977 --> 25:58.444
without the guards spotting us?

25:58.496 --> 25:59.996
We're not.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.082
You see those cargo containers
at the edge of the airfield?

26:03.150 --> 26:05.051
We'll get 'em to come to us.

26:25.072 --> 26:26.322
You're not going to kill him?

26:26.407 --> 26:27.891
It's risky to leave him--
trust me.

26:27.975 --> 26:31.094
We'll be long gone
before anyone finds him.

26:31.178 --> 26:35.114
You know, we studied you
in training.

26:35.182 --> 26:37.083
Everybody thought
you were a monster.

26:37.150 --> 26:38.501
But for somebody
with so many missions

26:38.586 --> 26:40.169
your body count
was abnormally low,

26:40.254 --> 26:41.638
and there were a lot
of theories about why.

26:41.722 --> 26:42.955
Yeah, like what?

26:43.007 --> 26:45.091
My instructor thought
it was a terror tactic.

26:45.142 --> 26:46.593
That you left people breathing

26:46.644 --> 26:48.478
to tell horror stories
and spread your legend.

26:48.562 --> 26:50.029
What did you think?

26:50.097 --> 26:52.982
I realized that you only kill
when it is absolutely necessary.

26:53.067 --> 26:55.418
See, after a while,
I could look at a diagram

26:55.502 --> 26:56.736
of one of your operations

26:56.787 --> 26:58.337
and predict
who you would let live.

26:58.389 --> 27:00.607
So your theory was
that I was noble?

27:00.674 --> 27:03.493
Or just weak.

27:03.577 --> 27:05.411
Let's go.

27:10.834 --> 27:12.502
Glenanne.

27:12.586 --> 27:14.254
Your lawyer's here.

27:14.305 --> 27:17.106
It's about time.

27:19.610 --> 27:21.644
It's you.

27:21.729 --> 27:25.965
I actually have a law degree,
for what it's worth.

27:26.033 --> 27:28.501
We need to talk,
Ms. Glenanne.

27:28.552 --> 27:30.503
I was hoping to resolve this
more quickly,

27:30.571 --> 27:34.006
but you don't
make things easy, do you?

27:34.058 --> 27:38.745
I told you I'm not interested
in helping you or the CIA.

27:38.812 --> 27:40.663
And I told you
you can't run away.

27:40.748 --> 27:42.432
You are either
out there helping me

27:42.516 --> 27:46.152
or you are in here doing
whatever it is you do in here.

27:46.220 --> 27:48.755
My relationship
with Michael is over.

27:48.822 --> 27:51.357
We've talked twice
in the last year.

27:51.425 --> 27:52.959
I want nothing to do with him.

27:53.026 --> 27:54.827
And I want nothing
to do with his mission.

27:54.878 --> 27:56.462
Well, you should.

27:56.530 --> 27:58.064
You know the deal
I made with Michael.

27:58.132 --> 28:00.199
Your freedom
depends on him doing--

28:00.267 --> 28:03.302
Getting exactly what he wanted
in the first place.

28:03.354 --> 28:05.488
Working for the CIA.

28:05.572 --> 28:08.607
I think maybe Michael
left out a few details.

28:08.659 --> 28:10.176
What do you mean?

28:10.244 --> 28:12.946
This is about a lot more than
him getting his old job back.

28:13.013 --> 28:16.766
This deal...
Is mission specific.

28:16.850 --> 28:19.352
If he fails to take down
this terror network

28:19.403 --> 28:22.488
you, your friends,
his mother--

28:22.539 --> 28:26.993
you all go back to prison
for a long, long time.

28:27.061 --> 28:30.964
Now he didn't mention that?

28:31.031 --> 28:32.498
No.

28:32.566 --> 28:34.367
Well, maybe he wanted
to protect you.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.503
Maybe he wanted
to go it alone.

28:37.571 --> 28:39.172
Frankly, it doesn't matter
what he wanted

28:39.206 --> 28:40.506
because he works for me,

28:40.557 --> 28:42.342
and he needs help
with this thing.

28:51.218 --> 28:54.587
When this mission is done,
I want out, free and clear,

28:54.655 --> 28:58.091
no matter what Michael does.

28:58.158 --> 28:59.942
Welcome aboard.

29:08.052 --> 29:11.354
If you have no choice but to
fly a plane in need of repair,

29:11.438 --> 29:14.941
it's better to focus on what's
necessary than what's ideal.

29:15.008 --> 29:17.360
Airplane technology
may be complex,

29:17.444 --> 29:19.328
but the physics
of flying are simple.

29:19.413 --> 29:21.914
If you don't mind throwing
away the safety manual

29:21.965 --> 29:23.966
all you need are wings,
a running engine,

29:24.051 --> 29:25.584
and workable controls.

29:25.636 --> 29:26.673
All right, this plane
is getting us out of here.

29:26.674 --> 29:28.024
This one?

29:28.108 --> 29:29.442
Looks like it's in the middle
of heart surgery.

29:29.510 --> 29:30.977
They're replacing the magnetic
electric generators.

29:31.028 --> 29:32.678
And those are for decoration?

29:32.730 --> 29:34.314
We don't need the backup.

29:34.365 --> 29:36.816
I can have this plane ready
to fly in 30 minutes.

29:36.867 --> 29:38.501
Call the tower,
try to get us clearance.

29:38.586 --> 29:41.621
I'll see what I can do.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.577
Yo.

30:20.661 --> 30:21.861
I don't like
the looks of that.

30:21.912 --> 30:23.079
Yeah, me neither.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.854
We just found Westen
and Sonya at the airport.

30:31.939 --> 30:33.673
What? No, no,
that's impossible.

30:33.724 --> 30:35.642
We just got a tip that
they were spotted in Matanzas.

30:35.693 --> 30:37.443
Your tip is wrong.

30:37.511 --> 30:41.347
I asked the airport tower to
report any unexpected activity.

30:41.398 --> 30:43.399
They just got a request
from a maintenance hangar

30:43.484 --> 30:44.701
that was supposed
to be dark today.

30:44.785 --> 30:46.286
So no one's seen him.

30:46.353 --> 30:47.904
You're basing
all this on a phone call.

30:47.988 --> 30:50.269
It could have come from anyone.
Then tell me why the guard

30:50.291 --> 30:52.024
closest to that hangar
is missing.

30:53.961 --> 30:57.163
They're in there.
I know it.

30:57.214 --> 30:58.665
We leave in five minutes.

30:58.716 --> 30:59.916
She found us.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.534
They're on their way.

31:01.585 --> 31:02.802
Is the plane ready?

31:02.869 --> 31:04.087
Close enough.

31:04.171 --> 31:06.089
We gotta get the doors open.

31:09.226 --> 31:10.310
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:12.813 --> 31:14.314
It's too late.
They're already here.

31:28.581 --> 31:30.749
They'll breach through
the front and the back doors.

31:30.817 --> 31:32.658
The moment they do,
we blow a hole in the wall,

31:32.718 --> 31:34.736
we make a run for it.
It won't work.

31:34.821 --> 31:36.755
I know Oksana.

31:36.822 --> 31:38.656
She'll bring reinforcements,
and they won't breach

31:38.708 --> 31:40.509
until they have an army
surrounding the place.

31:40.526 --> 31:41.693
We need to make it
to the trees.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.528
Once there,
if we can get to our car,

31:43.596 --> 31:45.447
we have a chance.
I won't take that chance.

31:45.531 --> 31:47.832
Sonya, you wanna
stay here and die?

31:48.281 --> 31:49.948
I cannot get captured again.

31:50.032 --> 31:51.299
We wait by the barrels

31:51.367 --> 31:52.934
and when they come in,
we go down fighting!

31:53.002 --> 31:54.152
You don't understand.

31:54.237 --> 31:56.621
No, you don't understand!

31:56.706 --> 31:59.240
They tortured me
for two solid weeks,

31:59.292 --> 32:01.209
and I held out.

32:01.277 --> 32:03.345
I can't do it again.

32:03.396 --> 32:05.346
And if I break
we lose everything,

32:05.398 --> 32:07.832
and I won't betray my friends.

32:15.257 --> 32:17.492
Okay, the whole force
is heading to the airport.

32:17.559 --> 32:19.560
We're gonna be outnumbered by,
like, 50 to 1.

32:19.612 --> 32:20.996
Hold on,
I might have something.

32:21.047 --> 32:22.514
I've been listening
to the radio.

32:22.598 --> 32:24.933
No one's actually seen Mike
and Sonya at the hangar yet.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.634
Maybe we can convince Oksana

32:26.686 --> 32:27.936
they're attacking
this place instead.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.154
- A fake attack?
- Yeah.

32:29.238 --> 32:30.789
I like it.

32:30.873 --> 32:32.407
You think there's enough C4
left in the car?

32:32.458 --> 32:34.709
I hope so.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.177
Buy me some time.

32:36.228 --> 32:38.947
I'm gonna go make
some bad things happen.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.946
When you're simulating
an attack on an enemy,

32:55.031 --> 32:58.566
it's more important to create
fear than to do any real damage.

33:03.105 --> 33:06.825
You can distribute your
explosives for maximum effect.

33:08.711 --> 33:10.712
You wanna use
a variety of weapons

33:10.780 --> 33:13.715
to suggest multiple attackers.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.851
And after that, all you need
is a good place to hide

33:16.902 --> 33:18.837
when the action starts.

33:18.921 --> 33:21.089
Colonel, we need to talk.

33:21.140 --> 33:22.757
Not now.
We are heading out.

33:22.808 --> 33:24.125
This is critical.

33:24.176 --> 33:25.737
Now listen,
when we approach the hangar,

33:25.761 --> 33:27.529
Virgil and I need
the helicopters in--

33:27.580 --> 33:29.114
There are no helicopters.

33:29.198 --> 33:31.158
You're going after Westen
with no eyes in the sky?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.668
The man is like a caged tiger.
You push him into a corner,

33:33.719 --> 33:34.936
he's just gonna
rip our faces off.

33:35.004 --> 33:37.972
I'm confident our faces will--

33:45.598 --> 33:47.298
What the hell was that?

33:48.985 --> 33:51.770
Virgil!
What the hell?

33:51.854 --> 33:53.538
My partner's dead.
They just killed Virgil.

33:53.622 --> 33:54.756
Oh, my God.
Who?

33:54.823 --> 33:56.007
Michael and Sonya.

33:56.092 --> 33:57.572
They're outside
the station right now.

33:57.593 --> 33:58.843
That's not possible.

33:58.928 --> 34:00.979
They are at the airport
trapped in a hangar.

34:01.063 --> 34:02.597
Did you just see
that fireball?

34:02.648 --> 34:05.033
That was my car!
They just blew up my partner!

34:05.084 --> 34:07.552
They're coming for us,
and they're gonna kill us all.

34:07.636 --> 34:09.871
No.
My men have them surrounded.

34:09.922 --> 34:12.306
Your men fell
for some kind of a trick.

34:12.373 --> 34:14.333
I'm telling you, they're
standing on our doorstep,

34:14.376 --> 34:15.656
and we're sitting ducks in here!

34:15.695 --> 34:17.195
You're wrong.

34:17.279 --> 34:19.880
We need to head for the airport.

34:19.947 --> 34:21.649
Attention, attention.

34:21.717 --> 34:24.235
This is Michael Westen.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.187
I need to speak
to Colonel Zhirkov.

34:26.237 --> 34:27.655
They have one of our radios.

34:27.706 --> 34:30.291
- Yeah, I guess they do.
- Are you listening?

34:30.342 --> 34:33.293
I am outside
with an old friend of yours.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.900
Pick up the radio, Colonel.

34:38.967 --> 34:40.402
Don't make me ask again.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.900
What the hell are you doing?

34:56.985 --> 34:59.738
Talk to the man.

35:01.991 --> 35:04.125
This is Colonel Zhirkov.

35:04.176 --> 35:07.479
You want to talk,
let's talk.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.597
All right,
that wasn't so hard.

35:09.648 --> 35:12.617
I want your men to step outside
and lay down their weapons.

35:12.701 --> 35:14.569
I don't think
you're in a position

35:14.620 --> 35:16.537
to make demands, Mr. Westen.

35:16.589 --> 35:18.005
There are two of you.

35:18.057 --> 35:19.691
I have a police station
full of men.

35:19.775 --> 35:21.642
For now.

35:21.694 --> 35:24.746
Get over to the window,
find him, and put him down.

35:24.797 --> 35:25.713
No, no, no.

35:25.781 --> 35:27.015
He's gonna see your sniper.

35:27.082 --> 35:28.683
Do I have to pick off your men

35:28.751 --> 35:30.391
one by one like your sniper
in the window?

35:30.402 --> 35:31.986
I'm done playing games!

35:38.377 --> 35:40.028
Call your men
back from the airport

35:40.095 --> 35:42.614
and buy us some time
until they get here.

35:51.190 --> 35:54.275
Hello?
Is anybody there?

36:02.268 --> 36:05.403
There is no need for further
bloodshed, Mr. Westen.

36:07.289 --> 36:09.357
I'm sure we can make
a deal of some sort.

36:09.408 --> 36:12.326
Just tell me what you want.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.813
It worked.
They're leaving.

36:14.897 --> 36:15.980
What about your friend?

36:18.634 --> 36:21.703
What do I want?

36:21.770 --> 36:24.088
I want the bastard
who tried to catch me.

36:24.173 --> 36:25.790
The one with the chin.

36:25.875 --> 36:26.791
You see?

36:26.876 --> 36:28.176
I told you he was insane.

36:28.244 --> 36:30.445
Send him out the front door.

36:30.513 --> 36:32.847
If he turns around,
shoot him.

36:32.898 --> 36:34.566
How can you do this to me?

36:34.650 --> 36:36.017
I was helping you!
Let's go.

36:36.068 --> 36:38.019
Colonel, don't hand me
off to them.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.154
They'll kill me.

36:39.205 --> 36:41.039
You told me to buy time.

36:41.123 --> 36:43.007
Guys, you don't wanna do this,
believe me.

36:43.092 --> 36:45.210
I got kids and a dog.

36:45.294 --> 36:48.196
- Out.
- Fine.

36:48.263 --> 36:49.981
My blood is on your hands.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.711
Hey, nice fake attack.

37:03.762 --> 37:04.979
Yeah, nothing to it.

37:05.047 --> 37:08.283
All right, let's do it.

37:08.334 --> 37:11.502
Look, I promise you two,
it's--it's nothing personal.

37:11.587 --> 37:12.954
You gotta believe me.

37:13.005 --> 37:15.139
I mean, we're--
we're just doing a job.

37:15.224 --> 37:18.593
Look, if you wanna walk away,
I won't stop you.

37:18.644 --> 37:19.727
Wait, wait.

37:19.778 --> 37:20.745
No. What are you doing?
No, no, please!

37:20.829 --> 37:22.163
Don't--don't kill me!
No--

37:24.717 --> 37:25.667
Bravo.

37:25.718 --> 37:27.502
You're a master thespian.

37:27.553 --> 37:28.803
Let's get to the airport

37:28.870 --> 37:30.305
before the entire
Cuban military shows up.

37:30.372 --> 37:31.356
Nice.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.390
That's a start.

37:32.474 --> 37:35.643
Next I want $1 million U.S.

37:35.694 --> 37:37.378
A million U.S.?

37:37.446 --> 37:38.779
That will take time.

37:38.831 --> 37:40.615
You got 20 minutes.

37:40.666 --> 37:43.001
You'll get your money.

37:43.085 --> 37:44.435
Sounds like
he's keeping her busy.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.970
Still gonna be tight.
Hop in.

37:47.856 --> 37:49.691
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:02.838 --> 38:05.340
Yeah, and one more thing.
We need new passports.

38:05.391 --> 38:09.093
We need them now,
or we unleash hell.

38:09.178 --> 38:11.980
I'm afraid we'll be the ones
unleashing hell, Mr. Westen.

38:12.031 --> 38:14.449
We have your position
completely surrounded.

38:14.516 --> 38:16.484
If you want to negotiate,

38:16.535 --> 38:19.654
hand over Sonya,
and I'll spare you.

38:19.705 --> 38:21.289
Come on, let's go!

38:21.356 --> 38:24.792
Mr. Westen,
live to fight another day.

38:24.860 --> 38:27.045
I'll give you the money,
the passports.

38:27.129 --> 38:28.546
I only want Sonya.

38:28.631 --> 38:30.131
Hand her over to me,

38:30.198 --> 38:32.216
and I'll even give you
the plane.

38:38.974 --> 38:39.891
Sonya.

38:52.655 --> 38:54.722
Tray tables up.
Here they come.

39:05.539 --> 39:07.267
Yeah, uh, hey, Lou, listen.

39:07.268 --> 39:09.218
Uh, something came up, man.

39:09.270 --> 39:10.937
Just a-a slight delay.

39:11.021 --> 39:14.190
It's nothing, all right?

39:14.241 --> 39:16.893
Uh, I gotta call you back.

39:16.944 --> 39:18.862
Hey, what happened?

39:18.913 --> 39:20.330
They wouldn't say anything.

39:20.397 --> 39:21.948
They wouldn't give me
any information.

39:22.032 --> 39:24.667
Well, they dropped
the charges.

39:24.735 --> 39:26.669
It's a long story.

39:26.737 --> 39:29.455
All right, well,
you'll tell me on the road?

39:29.540 --> 39:31.101
Uh, I just bought us
some time with Lou.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.458
As long as we get
to New Orleans by the morning,

39:32.543 --> 39:33.843
the job's still ours.

39:33.911 --> 39:37.180
I'll drive first.

39:37.247 --> 39:38.548
Okay.

39:38.599 --> 39:40.383
You can drive first.

39:40.434 --> 39:42.602
I can't go, Carlos.

39:42.686 --> 39:45.087
I'm sorry.

39:47.090 --> 39:48.892
Why can't you go, Fiona?

39:48.943 --> 39:53.262
You just said
the charges were dropped.

39:53.314 --> 39:56.065
Well, our lawyer
didn't get me out.

39:57.785 --> 40:00.620
Okay, so who did?

40:02.623 --> 40:03.656
The CIA.

40:03.741 --> 40:06.125
The CIA.

40:06.210 --> 40:09.162
So this is about Michael.

40:09.246 --> 40:10.780
He's on his way back
to Miami,

40:10.831 --> 40:12.465
and they're forcing me
to help him

40:12.550 --> 40:13.950
until the mission's over.

40:14.001 --> 40:15.635
I thought we were moving
on with our lives, Fiona.

40:15.719 --> 40:17.954
So did I.

40:18.005 --> 40:20.089
Look, I was hoping
I could put this behind me

40:20.140 --> 40:23.509
like it never happened,
but it did.

40:23.594 --> 40:25.728
Wiping the slate clean's
gonna take some work.

40:25.796 --> 40:28.681
And what do you expect me
to do, hmm?

40:28.766 --> 40:30.633
Sit around and wait?

40:30.684 --> 40:32.301
What about us?
I'm doing this for us!

40:32.353 --> 40:34.103
Don't say that, okay?

40:34.154 --> 40:35.989
Don't you dare say that.

40:36.073 --> 40:38.241
I-I--look, Fiona,
I don't want this.

40:38.308 --> 40:39.826
I don't want this.
Carlos.

40:39.910 --> 40:41.494
What?

40:41.579 --> 40:45.198
Look, until I deal
with my past,

40:45.282 --> 40:48.034
I-I can't be with you.
I--

40:49.987 --> 40:52.705
and I really wanna be
with you.

40:54.375 --> 40:57.677
Please tell me you understand.

40:57.761 --> 40:59.161
No.

40:59.213 --> 41:01.681
I don't understand.

41:04.351 --> 41:06.769
But I trust you.

41:06.837 --> 41:10.223
So if you say this is what you
have to do, then...

41:10.307 --> 41:12.508
Okay.

41:12.559 --> 41:14.444
I'm with you.

41:18.949 --> 41:20.783
Thank you.

41:24.705 --> 41:26.990
You know, I didn't think
air travel could be worse

41:27.041 --> 41:29.191
than my flight out of Bogota
in '94.

41:29.243 --> 41:30.627
I stand corrected.
Yeah, no joke.

41:30.694 --> 41:32.629
I thought the wings were gonna
blow off over Key Largo.

41:32.696 --> 41:34.330
If you wanted a smoother ride

41:34.381 --> 41:36.299
you should have got us into
a hangar with better planes.

41:36.366 --> 41:37.417
I don't wanna sound
high maintenance,

41:37.501 --> 41:38.751
but after squeezing
into that plane

41:38.836 --> 41:40.136
I'm gonna have to insist
that we steal something

41:40.203 --> 41:41.504
with a little more leg room
for the ride home.

41:41.555 --> 41:42.872
We don't need
to steal anything.

41:42.923 --> 41:44.390
What, did you order up
some limo service

41:44.475 --> 41:45.475
you didn't tell us about?

41:45.476 --> 41:48.711
I made arrangements.

41:48.762 --> 41:51.314
Fuzzy dice.

41:51.381 --> 41:53.850
What is this, like some kind
of magic genie thing?

41:53.901 --> 41:55.601
Do I get some wishes too?

41:55.686 --> 41:58.354
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I should take this.

41:58.405 --> 42:00.239
Hello?

42:00.324 --> 42:02.525
Okay, I'll admit she didn't
stab us in the back in Cuba,

42:02.559 --> 42:03.660
but she's trouble.

42:03.727 --> 42:05.048
You swim with
a shark long enough,

42:05.079 --> 42:06.612
eventually it's gonna
take a chunk out of you.

42:06.697 --> 42:08.081
Jesse, I hear you,
but I don't have much choice.

42:08.165 --> 42:09.532
Hey, at least
we're back in Miami.

42:09.583 --> 42:11.233
Home field advantage.

42:11.285 --> 42:12.919
Well, that was interesting.

42:13.003 --> 42:15.171
I just found out
who exposed my identity,

42:15.238 --> 42:16.539
got me captured
in the first place.

42:16.590 --> 42:19.408
- Who?
- Hacker syndicate.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.896
Based in Miami.
Somehow they found out who I was,

42:21.921 --> 42:23.479
sold me to the highest bidder.

42:23.504 --> 42:24.452
What now?

42:24.477 --> 42:26.119
We destroy them, of course.
