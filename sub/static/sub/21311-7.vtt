00:06.440 --> 00:07.141
- Previously, on "Shooter"...

00:08.709 --> 00:10.311
- I've known you
a long time now,

00:10.344 --> 00:12.113
and the woman I see
is not the woman I once knew.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.147
You're jumpy
and you snap at Mary.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.315
- What are you doing?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.549
You're saying I have PTSD.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.784
- Nice gripping, sweetheart.

00:16.817 --> 00:17.818
You mind if I see
how she handles?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.253
- Yeah, actually.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.454
- Don't have to be
a bitch about it.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.623
Move along, sweetheart.

00:22.656 --> 00:23.657
Ouch!

00:23.691 --> 00:25.059
[yelling]

00:25.093 --> 00:26.527
- You were right
about one thing:

00:26.560 --> 00:28.529
a bunch of terrorists
looking to kill some Marines.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.131
- Atlas exists,
and they're coming.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.365
- Martials are pulling up.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.067
Let's move.
- Time to go.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.302
- Aren't we gonna wait
for the Martials?

00:34.335 --> 00:35.503
- No.
We're on our own now.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.804
Zehnder said the cartels

00:36.837 --> 00:38.439
were in bed with
a shadowy organization

00:38.472 --> 00:40.174
called Atlas.
Said they even shared a banker--

00:40.208 --> 00:42.143
some fancy Wharton guy
down in Mexico.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.644
- That's the group Alexi
said Solotov works for.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.079
- Did you talk to Solotov?

00:45.113 --> 00:46.714
- I did.
- Zero out his accounts.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.216
Open it.
- It's time to go.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.118
- What are these?
Accounts, passwords?

00:50.151 --> 00:53.053
Ali, come in.
- He's in the truck with me.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.158
- What the hell?
- He was dead anyway.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.693
[tires screeching]

00:59.727 --> 01:02.096
- If we fight, we die.
Give me your phone

with no wallets this far south.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.350
Most of you get rolled
in Tijuana.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.652
- I told you, we were mugged.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.387
Asshole got everything.

02:33.421 --> 02:36.390
- Looks like
we're being mugged again.

02:36.424 --> 02:39.327
- We can definitely
work this out.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.263
- Oh, we're gonna
work this out, my friend--

02:42.296 --> 02:43.797
one way or another.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.333
- Where are you taking us?

02:46.634 --> 02:48.436
- We have family
that's gonna miss us.

02:48.469 --> 02:52.240
- Everyone has family
that's gonna miss them.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.674
- Yeah, but mine's got money.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.776
- Good.
You're gonna need it,

02:55.809 --> 02:58.512
Mr. Hutchins.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.548
- How much is this traffic stop
gonna cost us?

03:00.581 --> 03:02.950
- Something like this--
no ID,

03:02.983 --> 03:06.186

$5,000.

- Impound.
It'll be charged against

03:27.541 --> 03:29.443
your bill.
- Meaning?

03:29.477 --> 03:31.379
- Meaning you're never
gonna see it again.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.516
- That's a problem for me.
That's my dad's truck.

raised a smarter son.

I couldn't sleep
and I had to do something, so...

04:42.583 --> 04:44.918
- That's one heck
of an apology.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.690
Do you have the Zehnder
discharge papers?

04:50.824 --> 04:53.661
- Uh... [sighs]

04:53.694 --> 04:56.664
You just gotta dig
a little deeper.

04:56.697 --> 05:00.801
I've been through these things
back and forth for months.

05:00.834 --> 05:05.105
- How'd you get these?
- Freedom of Information Act.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.740
- You normally see
reports like this?

05:06.774 --> 05:08.342
- Yeah, all the time.

05:09.543 --> 05:13.080
- Discharge papers
with the psych report attached?

05:13.113 --> 05:15.416
Did you ask for this?
- Um...

05:15.449 --> 05:17.985
I required his personnel file
and that's all.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.554
So, I guess it came with it.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.822
- Uh-uh.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.892
No, Marine Corps wouldn't
send a psych report.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.561
They're trying to discredit him.

You know, my guess,
"Isaac Johnson" is on this line.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.100
He sold out Bob Lee.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.702
He'd do the same thing
to Zehnder.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.969
- Can you prove it?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.972
I don't think the Marines
are gonna confirm it.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.141
- Actually, one might.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.743
[beep]

05:42.776 --> 05:45.112
- Uh, yes,
this is Anthony Dowling,

05:45.145 --> 05:48.682
and my business manager said
that there has been a problem

05:48.716 --> 05:51.084

06:03.664 --> 06:05.999
Could I have the new
account number, please?

06:06.033 --> 06:09.903
The thing is,
he's on vacation in Fiji.

06:11.772 --> 06:15.543
Then...we'll just have
to wait till he returns...

06:35.696 --> 06:37.765
I don't wanna know
what prison looks like.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.568
- Worse, if it's anything
like the jail I was in.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.169
- [chuckles]
You say that like

06:42.202 --> 06:44.171
you did a 20-year stretch
at Alcatraz.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.940
You were locked up for, what,
two days before you escaped?

06:46.974 --> 06:50.143
- Escaped by killing two men
with my bare hands.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.045
- Don't act like
it's haunting you.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.047
We chose our path.
- Nah.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.650
Some of us had our paths chosen.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.452
- We can get
to marriage counseling

06:58.486 --> 07:01.789
after we get out of here.
For now, we need a plan.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.825
- The plan is don't die.
- And how long before

07:04.858 --> 07:07.661
Chief Moustache puts us
at Carlos', huh?

07:07.695 --> 07:09.663
If these assholes don't try
to kill us in here,

07:09.697 --> 07:13.066
Solotov will put it together
when we don't show up in Texas.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.968

- Hey.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.071
You fellas need anything?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.807
- Tell your story walking.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.175
- Don't need to be like that.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.977
Just trying to help.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.513
- You're trying to see
if I'm a bitch,

07:25.546 --> 07:26.847
and you're about to find out.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.216
- All right, dial it down.
- Yeah.

to your daddy?

- That was dumb.
- Hey, I ain't from the 'burbs.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.112
- Yeah, but you gotta
get tactical.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.714
Be smart.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.850
Pretending to be scared
is an advantage.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.184
You gave it up
to the first asshole

08:04.217 --> 08:05.553
that insulted you,

08:05.586 --> 08:07.621
and that asshole has friends.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.959
- You checked Mary's room
three times.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.561
- Yeah, I know.
Sometimes she likes

08:13.594 --> 08:14.995
to play games on it, though.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.296
- Unless it's a game
of hiding it,

08:16.329 --> 08:18.498
I don't think it's in there.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.869
- I'm gonna be late
for picking her up, though.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.237
- You've got over an hour.
- No, I know--

08:24.271 --> 08:25.873
I wanted to stop
by the hardware store

08:25.906 --> 08:29.076
and pick up the paint samples
we picked out.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.144
- Have you checked your bag?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.180
- Uh, no, but I can--uh...

08:33.213 --> 08:34.815
check it.

08:36.183 --> 08:40.220
It's just for protection.
- What else would it be for?

08:40.253 --> 08:41.755
- With everything going on
with Bob Lee,

08:41.789 --> 08:44.792
you just...you know,
can't be too safe.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.099
Of course.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.936
[sighs]

08:56.837 --> 08:58.872
- All right, you're good to go.

09:08.849 --> 09:14.354
Sorry, Julie, but I can't
let you shoot here anymore.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.757
- Gary, come on.
- You discharged your weapon

09:16.790 --> 09:18.225
without regard
to another shooter.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.326
- You saw what he did, right?

09:19.359 --> 09:20.661
- That doesn't matter.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.033
- Gary.
- I'm sorry, Julie.

- Hey, you.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.807
You coming or going?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.577
- Going, unfortunately.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.982

09:43.851 --> 09:47.154
- Yeah, yeah--
I'm just worked up.

How are you?

- Yeah?

- Yeah, you know how it is.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.997
Bob Lee's out of town, huh?

09:57.030 --> 10:00.067
- Yeah, he's hunting
with the boys.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.003
- Yeah, boys start having fun,
we tend to forget everything.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.872
- Mm, don't I know.
- [laughs]

is just a little bit of a drag,

10:08.275 --> 10:09.877
that's all.
- Yeah, you know, my wife says

10:09.910 --> 10:11.378
the same thing.
- Yeah?

10:11.411 --> 10:12.980
- Yeah, she just can't imagine
how wondrous

10:13.013 --> 10:15.683
and glorious the life
of a traveling salesman is.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.117
Right?
- [laughing] Yeah.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.886
- I've had enough bad
continental breakfasts

10:18.919 --> 10:22.255
to know better.
- Oh, I can only imagine.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.125
Hey, you know what?
Mary has her First Communion

10:25.158 --> 10:27.127
this weekend at the church,
and they make

10:27.160 --> 10:28.862
a whole deal of it.
They have breakfast there,

10:28.896 --> 10:30.798
so you're more than welcome
to come.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.666
And Bob Lee wouldn't miss it
for the world,

10:32.700 --> 10:35.135
so, it'll give you
a chance to meet him.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.004
- Well, I wouldn't miss it
either, then.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.172
- Great, I look forward to it.
I'll see you then, okay?

10:39.472 --> 10:40.708

It's like they don't want
a record of anything.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.791
- Yeah, and check out
the guards.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.226
- Two of them still have
their safeties on.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.128
- And one doesn't have
his mag all the way in.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.031

the gate.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.900

do anything to you.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.471
- That's no reason to kill.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.006
- I don't need a reason anymore,

11:13.040 --> 11:14.374
and I'm not asking permission.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.743

We used to have a rules,

- If I ended up sending it, yes.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.761
- Well, that's the difference
between me and you.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.395
When they killed my wife,
they killed my code.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.797
I don't give a shit.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.832
- [grunts]
- [coughing]

11:41.368 --> 11:43.070
- Well, I do give a shit.

11:52.345 --> 11:52.712
.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.448
[indistinct chatter]

12:02.255 --> 12:04.224
- Just like boot camp.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.927
- At least the food
on Parris Island was edible.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.262
- Seems to be working
for these guys.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.398
- [scoffs]
Never thought I'd say this,

12:11.431 --> 12:14.201
but I'd kill
for an MRE right now.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.776
- I see at least
two egress points.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.512
- It's gonna be hard to do
without getting a little bloody.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.816
- As long as it's non-lethal.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.150
- You said you had to
kill those guys

12:30.183 --> 12:31.251
to escape last year.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.385
- After they tried to kill me.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.221
There's a difference.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.389
- Not to me.
- No shit.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.158
But this time,
it's gonna go my way

12:38.191 --> 12:39.459
or not go at all.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.165
- Hey, listen...

12:45.198 --> 12:49.402
about last year.
- When you set me up?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.071
- It wasn't my plan
to send those guys

12:51.104 --> 12:54.107
to kill you in prison.
- Well!

12:54.141 --> 12:57.210
You want some of my food?

12:57.244 --> 12:58.445
You were gonna have
Payne kill me

12:58.478 --> 13:00.213
at the assassination.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.985
- You ever dial in
a long shot...

13:05.018 --> 13:08.288
and at the last moment,
something distracts you?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.590
Maybe the smallest adjustment--
a breath--

13:10.623 --> 13:12.359
can send your ordinance
a hundred feet away

13:12.392 --> 13:14.461
from the target.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.329
- Sounds like a whole lot
of bullshit.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.368
- I made a series
of mistakes, man.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.604
- Was Donny's mom
one of those mistakes?

13:24.637 --> 13:29.076
*

13:29.109 --> 13:32.812
- Yeah, she was.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.184
- That's all you got?

13:37.217 --> 13:40.353
- I think about it every day.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.255
I'm never gonna be
on the right side of it.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.624
- That's 'cause
there is no right side.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.459
She was 70 years old,
living alone,

13:46.493 --> 13:48.261
minding her own business.

13:48.295 --> 13:52.499
- Do you have any idea what
Jack Payne would've done to her?

13:52.532 --> 13:55.635
He would've tortured that woman
and laughed while he did it.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.971
He would've cut her to pieces.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.910
I had to do it.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.014
Yeah, it was wrong.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.284
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life regretting it.

14:13.453 --> 14:17.357
I'm not looking for redemption,
Bob Lee.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.960
I am what I am.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.495
- Well, at least now
you're telling the truth.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.038
- I was surprised
to find you local.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.674
- Well, after all the bullshit
in Frankfurt,

14:34.707 --> 14:37.444
they transferred me
back to the fleet.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.980
Waiting on deployment.
Who's your friend?

14:40.013 --> 14:42.182
- This is Jeffrey Denning.
He's a reporter.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.985
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.020
- Well, brass says I can't
give any statements

14:47.054 --> 14:49.422
about what happened in Germany.
- Oh, um...

14:49.456 --> 14:51.891
Well, that's not why I'm here.
I need your help.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.963
I need proof
that these were faked.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.366
The only way to do that is to

14:59.399 --> 15:02.002
get into the
Marine Records facility here.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.303
- Why do you need me?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.505
- Because I don't want
to file a warrant.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.307
- No offense...

15:07.340 --> 15:08.608
I barely know you,

15:08.641 --> 15:12.412
and I really don't know him.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.014
Okay, shit got weird
after Germany.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.449
It's best if I stay low.
- Look, I get that.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.953
But these documents connect
to Frankfurt.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.455
And to the CIA heroin.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.291
- I gotta go.
- Hey.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.592
Hey!
You know what,

15:25.625 --> 15:26.960
you might be safe here;

15:26.994 --> 15:28.195
Bob Lee isn't.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.063
[soft music]

15:30.097 --> 15:33.166
He's got a wife, a child.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.168
You know you're being hunted.
Don't give me some bullshit

15:35.202 --> 15:37.004
about waiting to be deployed.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.108
You're scared,
and you should be.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.544
- What's this have
to do with that?

15:44.577 --> 15:47.714
- I'll explain on the way.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.654
- A fire will draw a crowd.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.290
- Yeah.
Well, just hang back.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.558
We're not gonna fake our way
out of here.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.027
We need those guns.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.997
- Read about a prison
like this in Argentina,

16:04.031 --> 16:05.498
the guards stand
on the outside.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.400
I never believed it.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.336
- And once the fire burns,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.104
one of 'em is gonna
have to enter.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.639
- What about the chief?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.207
- They shoot,
we shoot back.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.775
We don't need any more press.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.277
Ready?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.639
- I told you,
I don't have any money on me.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.541
If you let me make a call,
I can probably get--

16:48.575 --> 16:51.178
- This is no longer
about paying fines.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.282
I need the contents

16:55.315 --> 16:58.551
of Carlos Cruz's safe.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.587
- Who's Carlos Cruz?

17:00.620 --> 17:02.355
[eerie music]

17:02.389 --> 17:04.191
- He worked for some
very powerful people

17:04.224 --> 17:06.059
who are willing to kill
for what you stole,

17:06.093 --> 17:09.562
and I'm the only person standing
in between you and them.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.364

17:11.398 --> 17:13.566
- Well, I don't know any Carlos.

17:13.600 --> 17:18.105
And...I don't know who that is,
but it's not my friend.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.806
- [sighs]

17:19.839 --> 17:23.410
Give me the contents
of the safe

17:23.443 --> 17:26.846
and you can go free,
right now.

17:26.879 --> 17:31.084
Your amigo has to stay,
but you go.

You're thinking about escape?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.195
Maybe using one
of those cheap knives

17:42.229 --> 17:44.631
that you grabbed off
of one of those prisoners?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.704
I'm not the one

17:51.738 --> 17:55.442
that you have to worry about,
young man.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.111
Everyone
in that holding facility

17:58.145 --> 18:01.514
works for the cartel,
one way or the other.

Pendejo.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.464
Take him back to the yard.

Do you know where

18:23.236 --> 18:25.272
the juice boxes are we got?
Mary wants to have a picnic.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.773
- In the refrigerator,
on the door.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.376
- Oh, of course.
- Mary keeps asking

18:29.409 --> 18:32.212
about Bob Lee.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.413
- Yeah, I'll talk to her.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.548
- Do you know where he is?

18:35.582 --> 18:38.451
- Somewhere in Mexico.

18:38.485 --> 18:41.921
- Somewhere in Mexico?

- Change of plans.
- What happened?

19:01.641 --> 19:04.377
- They got your face
from a security camera.

19:04.411 --> 19:07.547
Moustache showed me a printout.
It's in the system.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.250
- Meaning Solotov will find it.
All right.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.918
Let him come.

do I have to tell you

19:13.820 --> 19:15.688

20:05.338 --> 20:05.705
- [sighs] Okay.

20:06.773 --> 20:07.940
You can access the files,

20:07.974 --> 20:09.342
you just can't remove them.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.677
I'm just looking
for confirmation.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.945
- You really think
it was Johnson?

20:12.979 --> 20:15.715
- I don't know who it is,
but he's a likely candidate.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.552
- And then what?

20:19.586 --> 20:20.953
- Well, if we get someone
on record

20:20.987 --> 20:22.989
breaking the law,
we start there.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.691
Pull enough cards,
and eventually,

20:24.724 --> 20:26.326
the house will collapse.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.702
She seemed off.

to Leavenworth for this.

By tomorrow, the cartels
will have heard of you,

20:50.617 --> 20:53.453
and an hour after that,
you will be released

20:53.486 --> 20:55.955

and never seen again.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.591
Or one of you...

will give me what I requested.

21:00.627 --> 21:04.797
And that person will go free.

another five minutes.

It may not be that easy to find.

Where's your commanding officer?

How can I be of service?

21:44.103 --> 21:45.705

for deployment here.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.707
I need to see a file.
- No can do, ma'am.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.709

and call Miriam Wagner,

I'll be out in one minute.

Director Wagner on the phone.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.534
She says she's
no longer your boss

22:14.567 --> 22:16.135
and you're of violation
of this facility's protocol.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.837
- Is there another way
out of here?

22:17.870 --> 22:20.540

but you won't be using it.

gonna die here,

22:35.121 --> 22:37.790
why don't you give me
a real answer?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.859
- On what?

22:39.892 --> 22:42.495
- Why you sold me out last year.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.467

We served

22:48.968 --> 22:50.470

of assholes.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.138
You weren't one of them.

- You were the best
long gunman in the Corps,

22:58.445 --> 22:59.979
Bob Lee,
so I'm gonna go ahead

23:00.012 --> 23:02.515
and assume that you didn't
spend much time thinking

23:02.549 --> 23:05.485
about your station in life,
like I did.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.856
- So it was about your ego?

23:09.889 --> 23:13.860
- I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.

23:13.893 --> 23:17.797
And not for nothing.
I was good at it.

You know, there were a lot

into the field,
expecting you to get killed.

It's not guys like you and me.

It's always some douche-bag

23:53.900 --> 23:56.536

I just wanted to

38:13.492 --> 38:16.362
I'm not here to arrest you.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.630
Not for being UA, anyway.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.601
- How'd you find me?

38:24.803 --> 38:26.338
The picture.

38:26.372 --> 38:29.341
- Yeah, sentiment
can be a bitch.

Your brother gets out
of Mansfield in four months.

right around the time

38:36.114 --> 38:38.417
you heard the name
Hugh Meachum.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.420

this mortgage.

38:41.453 --> 38:45.090
It's his house.
- It was going to foreclose.

Who asked you to sign your name
to Zehnder's psych evals?

38:54.566 --> 38:57.035
I know it wasn't Johnson.
- Memphis, you have no idea

38:57.068 --> 39:00.772
the shit you just stepped in.
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.974
Start talking...

[dramatic piano music]

39:08.547 --> 39:11.517
- Not here.
- Why?

they can.
