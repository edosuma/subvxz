- Someone needs
your help, Michael.

It starts with me
nearly getting blown up.
You remember that, right?

00:49.183 --> 00:54.088
Well, the way the door was
rigged, I realized the bomber
had to leave from the balcony.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.191
Sure enough, the security camera
down the block
caught him on tape.

- Hold that.
- He was a hard man to find,

Turns out he was a hired gun.
Good guy, really.

on the offshore bank
that paid him.

I tried to follow the money,
but that turned out to be
a dead end.

is paranoid, careful,
and he knows I'm close.

into such a storyteller.

Are you blaming me
for playing this
close to the vest?

01:37.265 --> 01:41.635
It was a leak in your
organization that nearly got me
killed. I need you to back off.

kill you twice,

- Victor.
- I'll see you soon, sport.
I promise.

Tell me what you see, Fiona.
- Old Sam looks sweaty.

- Fi.
- Just trying to cut
the tension, Michael.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.409
[ Fiona ]
Wait, there's Brennen.
He used the southwest approach.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.478
Well, I'm in position.
If he doesn't leave this way--

12:25.545 --> 12:27.981
He'll have to get past me.

12:28.048 --> 12:32.519
"Come alone."
I guess that was
too hard to understand.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.389
- Who's your friend, Sam?
- Call me Chuck.
It'll be less confusing.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.927
I'm just here to make sure
everything goes smoothly.

12:39.993 --> 12:44.264
Well, Chuck, number one,
R.S.V.P. next time,
and number two, shut up.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.267
I was talking to her.
The chip, let's see it.

Where's my son?
Where's Charlie?

12:49.837 --> 12:53.306
Trust me,
I'm not looking to adopt.
I'm looking to retire.

Most black market transactions
tend to go the same way.

First payment is inspected,
then the goods are brought
to the table.

13:04.784 --> 13:09.056
This standard sequence
is meant to ensure both parties
against a blown deal.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.892
- Curley?
- But that doesn't
stop some people...

13:11.959 --> 13:13.827
from bringing a little
extra insurance.

- Charlie!
- Mom!

Come here.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.168
He's fine.
His arm is fine.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.704
Whether it stays that way
is up to you.

13:24.771 --> 13:28.441
- What did they do to you?
- Sam, be careful.
That's not just a cast.

13:28.508 --> 13:32.045
No. See, you can't trot a kid
out in public with a bomb
strapped to his arm,

13:32.112 --> 13:34.647
but I had this nifty idea--

13:34.714 --> 13:38.852
molded plastic explosive under
the fiberglass, radio detonator
with a mile radius.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.820
You can cut it off

to start until I'm safely away.

You gotta let him go.

it's worth lives.

The engineer that built it
is at a conference in Tokyo.

He doesn't get back until
Friday. I figure that's
a pretty good head start.

You want Charlie...

to be mine?

he might be.

Of course, if your target has

If it goes well,
you can go home.

39:50.656 --> 39:54.793
You could sleep in your own bed.
You won't have to pretend
to sleep in mine.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.162
Oh.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.598
I'm sorry.

39:59.665 --> 40:04.035
I-I know I shouldn't have been
eavesdropping last night, and
also I didn't hear everything,

40:04.102 --> 40:07.773
but I still-- I shouldn't--
Mom, it's all right.
I don't give you much choice.

40:09.307 --> 40:12.410
I'm sorry.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.517
Michael?

40:19.651 --> 40:22.621
You picked the right girl.

40:24.189 --> 40:26.858
I just hope you're not waiting
for her to propose too.

[ Beeps ]

40:57.989 --> 41:01.359
Ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah.

41:01.426 --> 41:03.562
What? The metal detector
wasn't enough?

41:03.629 --> 41:08.700
Oh, it's not that I don't trust
you, it's just that, uh,
I don't trust you.

41:15.641 --> 41:18.443
Okay, here's my one-time,
expires immediately offer.

41:18.510 --> 41:22.714
You tell Carla someone else
went after her operatives,
and we're friends--

41:22.781 --> 41:26.818
kind of friends who don't
go bowling, don't go for beers,
don't even really speak,

41:28.053 --> 41:30.155
but also don't
try to kill each other.

41:30.221 --> 41:33.992
Yeah, I was looking for
a little more carrot
and a lot less stick.

41:34.059 --> 41:37.028
I have questions,
and I think you can
answer them.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.064
You're serious.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.999
That was your idea?

41:41.066 --> 41:43.001
All life's mysteries
revealed in the men's john...

41:43.068 --> 41:45.003
of the Miami-Dade City Hall
and Municipal Building?

41:45.070 --> 41:49.040
Actually, yeah.
Uh, that's what I want exactly.

41:49.107 --> 41:52.043
Well, that's not on the menu.
What I'm offering is this.

41:52.110 --> 41:56.381
We're friends on my terms,
or we're enemies.

41:56.447 --> 41:59.084
And I'm asking for answers.

[ Michael Narrating ]
Spend a career in covert ops and
you learn a lot about yourself.

42:29.715 --> 42:32.684
Will you lie to learn
something important? Yes.

42:32.751 --> 42:35.153
Will you betray someone
to serve a higher cause?

42:35.220 --> 42:37.122
Maybe.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.357
Will you trade another man's
life for your freedom?

42:39.424 --> 42:43.328
You don't really know the answer
until you face the question.
