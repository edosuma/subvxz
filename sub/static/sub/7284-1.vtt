00:21.018 --> 00:23.604
Wait, one

00:25.146 --> 00:27.732
Wait, two

00:29.626 --> 00:31.481
Three

00:33.466 --> 00:35.887
Hey. What's up, everybody?

00:35.962 --> 00:38.101
I'm Thurgood Jenkins.
You know, it's funny,

00:38.170 --> 00:43.353
but I can trace the entire path
of my life to one childhood memory.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.240
My last clear memory, really.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.859
You see, it was the summer
before ninth grade.

00:47.930 --> 00:50.483
It was me, Brian, Kenny,
Scarface...

00:50.554 --> 00:53.205
and of course
the loveable Old James.

00:53.274 --> 00:57.300
Oh, hold on. Wait a minute.
Old JamesOld James wasn't there.

00:57.370 --> 01:02.225
I don't even know nobody named
Old James. Shoot. Go on!

01:04.218 --> 01:08.277
Why don't you light it up there, brother?
All right. Here goes nothin'.

01:13.754 --> 01:18.740
I don't remember graduatin'. And my first sexual experience
I don't remember that either.

01:18.810 --> 01:23.447
But, man, I will never forget
the first time I smoked...

01:23.514 --> 01:25.522
that sweet, sweet chiva.

01:25.594 --> 01:29.817
Feel anything?
Yeah, I feel my chest cavin' in.

01:29.882 --> 01:33.199
This stuff didn't even work.
Man!

01:33.274 --> 01:36.373
Come on. Let's get some candy
and get out of here, B.

01:50.810 --> 01:55.447
I've heard people say they don't
get high the first time they smoke.

01:55.514 --> 01:58.197
Not me. Oh, not us.

01:58.266 --> 02:01.332
We were really, really high.

02:01.402 --> 02:03.890
We was toe up!

02:12.122 --> 02:15.122
Do you guys feel different?
A little.

02:15.194 --> 02:17.136
How 'bout you, Scarface?

02:19.642 --> 02:22.708
How you doin', Kenny? Kenny?

02:24.186 --> 02:27.961
I haven't been so thirsty
in my entire life.

02:28.026 --> 02:29.684
Do you guys hear that?

02:29.722 --> 02:34.872
Feels like Jerry Garcia's in my head.
Am I goin' crazy?

02:34.938 --> 02:40.088
We look at that day as the day we met the fifth member of our crew
marijuana!

02:41.178 --> 02:45.335
Oh, Lord, we was hooked!

02:45.402 --> 02:47.823
So, now we all live together
in New York.

02:47.898 --> 02:51.379
I myself am a master
of the custodial arts,

02:51.450 --> 02:54.352
or a janitor if you want
to be a dick about it.

02:54.425 --> 02:58.452
Anyway, I work at this lab,
Frankensense and Burr Pharmaceutical.

02:58.522 --> 03:01.075
They do pharmaceutical testing
for the government...

03:01.145 --> 03:03.120
and big corporations and...

03:03.194 --> 03:06.543
And I am
the happiest custodian alive.

03:09.114 --> 03:11.602
This job... sucks.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.688
Abba-Zabba,

03:16.762 --> 03:18.616
you my only friend.

03:18.682 --> 03:21.681
Ah, it could be worse.
I could have Scarface's job.

03:21.754 --> 03:25.846
Heifer with cheese.
You son of a bitch, I'm right behind you!

03:25.914 --> 03:28.597
Turn around and ask me
for Heifer with cheese, yo!

03:28.666 --> 03:32.278
Why you gotta make me feel inferior
'cause I'm on the grill, B? Damn!

03:32.346 --> 03:36.143
Scarface is kind of a hyper guy for a pothead.
Sorry.

03:36.218 --> 03:38.868
Kenny is probably doin'
the best out of all of us.

03:38.937 --> 03:41.807
He's a kindergarten teacher
at some school downtown,

03:41.882 --> 03:45.744
which I know might scare a lot of parents,
seeing as how he's a weedhead and all.

03:45.818 --> 03:50.574
But let me tell you, man, that guy does
wonders for those children's self-esteem.

03:50.650 --> 03:53.749
Thank you.
Oh, I love you so much, little one.

03:53.818 --> 03:57.811
All of you. All of you. It's so good.

03:57.882 --> 04:00.697
Brian works at a new and used record store.
Hi.

04:00.762 --> 04:04.024
He gets to talk about music all day.
I got a used Kenny Loggins album.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.512
Perfect job for a stoner.

04:06.586 --> 04:10.579
Lady, you want seven bucks
for a used Kenny Loggins record?

04:10.650 --> 04:14.327
I'll give you five.
Uh-uh. He autographed it himself.

04:16.218 --> 04:19.829
All right,
I'll give you four.

04:19.898 --> 04:22.200
Jan, stop it, man.

04:22.490 --> 04:25.905
As far as herb goes, you can
get it all over this town.

04:25.977 --> 04:29.490
I mean, they might call it the city that
never sleeps, but I'll tell you this:

04:29.562 --> 04:34.167
It takes a lot of fuckin' weed naps.
Free!

04:34.234 --> 04:37.495
You can get the stuff at little
corner stores called bodegas.

04:37.562 --> 04:40.561
Say it with me:

04:40.633 --> 04:42.488
Yes, very good.

04:42.553 --> 04:46.350
These places always have incredibly old products.
Como esta, fellas?

04:46.426 --> 04:48.433
Hey-Hey.
But the weed ain't bad.

04:48.506 --> 04:53.907
Let me get four dime bags.
Uh, I don't have no idea what you're talking about.

04:57.082 --> 05:01.359
Jose, you crazy, man. He's crazy.
Come on, man. Let me get them dimes.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.052
See, the problem with bodegas
is they never remember you.

05:04.122 --> 05:07.603
You always have to do something
extreme to let 'em know you're cool.

05:07.674 --> 05:10.608
Hey, fellas. Y'all know me.
Come on, now. Look at this.

05:10.682 --> 05:15.286
Hey, black ass. Why you
didn't moon us earlier, eh?

05:15.354 --> 05:16.914
It was a little degrading.

05:16.986 --> 05:20.783
If you desperate, you can get it from
the Rastas at Washington Square Park,

05:20.857 --> 05:23.574
but their stuff ain't even weed
most the time.

05:23.642 --> 05:25.496
I don't fall
for that shit anymore.

05:28.858 --> 05:32.273
Then there's a delivery service run
by a guy named Samson Simpson.

05:32.346 --> 05:34.647
Now, when you can afford it,
this is the best way.

05:34.714 --> 05:37.714
I mean, you can get anything
you want, from weed to heroin.

05:37.785 --> 05:40.241
Now, I don't do drugs, though.
Just weed.

05:40.313 --> 05:42.168
Coming.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.852
See, all you have to do is call
them up, and a half hour later,

05:44.922 --> 05:47.955
you got a delivery guy
at your house.

05:48.026 --> 05:50.928
What a country!

05:52.537 --> 05:55.287
Hi, you called about your plumbing?
Empty pipes?

05:55.354 --> 06:00.242
Secret code.
Come on in.

06:00.313 --> 06:03.958
You want highs, mediums or lows?
How are the highs, man?

06:04.026 --> 06:08.466
I say they got a piney taste, almost
minty. Notice the little red hairs.

06:08.538 --> 06:09.815
Yeah.
And the rich greenery?

06:09.850 --> 06:14.127
I see those.
And it's definitely the highest grade hydroponics in the city.

06:14.202 --> 06:16.755
What, did you go
to weed college? Damn, nigger.

06:16.826 --> 06:19.509
All right.
Give me a 50 bag of that.

06:21.177 --> 06:23.599
Been a pleasure.
Pleasure's all mine.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.543
Tell Samson I said hello, would ya?
Sure thing.

06:26.618 --> 06:30.098
Now, everybody has their own little
ritual when it comes to smokin'.

06:30.170 --> 06:32.472
Dope has arrived, fellas.
And we were no different.

06:32.538 --> 06:35.767
Break out Billy Bong Thornton.
Yeah.

06:35.833 --> 06:38.005
Whoo!

06:40.058 --> 06:45.044
Billy, good to see you, man.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.676
All right.
Light it up.

06:50.745 --> 06:52.600
Shoes off.

06:54.937 --> 06:57.326
Oh, Brian,
put yours back on, man.

06:57.402 --> 06:59.606
For real, amigo.
Do your sock laundry, yo.

07:02.746 --> 07:07.797
Gentlemen,
assume your positions.

07:07.865 --> 07:10.713
Yeah.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.872
Fire in the hole.

07:14.937 --> 07:18.450
We found it on the corner
So when we say

07:18.522 --> 07:22.134
Bip
Oxygen

07:22.202 --> 07:26.130
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm-
Oh, bip

07:28.314 --> 07:30.485
Th-That's good

07:30.553 --> 07:33.587
Yo, who's on munchies tonight, yo?
Not me.

07:33.658 --> 07:35.959
I guess that'd be me.

07:38.266 --> 07:40.121
What do you guys want?

07:41.146 --> 07:43.317
Get some...

07:43.385 --> 07:46.800
sour cream and onion chips...

07:46.873 --> 07:48.728
with some dip, man.

07:48.793 --> 07:50.833
Some beef jerky.
Some peanut butter.

07:50.906 --> 07:54.288
Get some Haagen Dazs
ice cream bars. A whole lot.

07:54.361 --> 07:56.565
Make sure chocolate.
Gotta have chocolate, man.

07:56.633 --> 07:59.667
Some popcorn. Bread. Popcorn.
Graham crackers.

07:59.738 --> 08:01.593
Graham crackers with the marshmallows,
the little marshmallows.

08:01.658 --> 08:03.959
And little chocolate bars.
We'll make some smores, man.

08:04.026 --> 08:07.342
Yeah, that's what
I was sayin', yo.

08:07.418 --> 08:11.030
Also celery, grape jelly, Captain Crunch
with the little crunch berries.

08:11.098 --> 08:14.643
Pizzas.
We need two big pizzas, man.

08:14.713 --> 08:18.194
Everything on 'em.
With water, whole lot of water.

08:18.265 --> 08:22.194
And... Funyuns.

08:22.266 --> 08:24.120
Yeah.

08:25.370 --> 08:28.305
That's it?
Yeah.

08:28.378 --> 08:30.232
Anything else?
Oh, yeah.

08:30.298 --> 08:34.453
Get me a box of condoms,
and, um, what's that stuff?

08:34.520 --> 08:36.909
We used to eat it all the time
back in the day.

08:36.986 --> 08:39.855
Pussy. That's right.
You got it.

08:39.929 --> 08:43.312
Thanks, man.
Hey, hey!

08:43.385 --> 08:48.917
If I'm not back in ten minutes,
call the police.

08:54.329 --> 08:56.239
If he ain't back
in ten minutes,

08:56.313 --> 08:59.313
we callin' Domino's.

08:59.385 --> 09:01.360
I'm hungry, man.
All right, yo.

09:12.410 --> 09:14.297
Hey, girl.

09:14.362 --> 09:17.395
You hungry?
Fuck you, nigger!

09:17.465 --> 09:21.808
Hey, I'm sorry.
I was talkin' to the horse.

09:21.881 --> 09:24.248
See the trouble
you're gettin' me into?

09:26.138 --> 09:29.105
You're hungry,
aren't ya? Here.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.879
You like popcorn.

09:33.945 --> 09:38.201
It makes your teeth go
pop, pop, pop.

09:38.266 --> 09:41.910
This is Buster Phillips, and coming
in at number eight, like El Nino,

09:41.977 --> 09:46.167
"Samson Gets Me Lifted," by my
main manWho? Sir Smoka Lot.

09:46.233 --> 09:48.088
Ha!

09:51.385 --> 09:55.695
This guy is weed crazy.
Look at that.

09:55.769 --> 10:00.242
What do you want, Master?
Bitch, you know what I want.

10:01.658 --> 10:03.567
I wanna talk to Samson

10:03.642 --> 10:06.511
Fly me to the moon like
that bitch Alice Kramden

10:06.585 --> 10:08.690
'Cause it's hard bein'
black and gifted

10:08.761 --> 10:11.761
Sometimes I wanna throw it
all down and get lifted

10:11.833 --> 10:14.102
That is so cool, man.

10:14.169 --> 10:17.333
He got the same dealer as us.
What you mean?

10:17.401 --> 10:22.486
Samson.
Oh, right.

10:22.553 --> 10:26.034
Everybody knows in my neighborhood
it's the bestest around

10:26.105 --> 10:29.172
Samson's shit is blessed
Got the whole town on lockdown

10:29.242 --> 10:32.405
That's where
I want to live. Right there.

10:32.474 --> 10:34.546
Think about this shit
please

10:34.841 --> 10:37.558
I'm all out.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.211
I'm all out of food.
You ate it all.

10:40.281 --> 10:44.143
Gee, you must've been
so hungry.

10:44.217 --> 10:47.184
Uh-oh.

10:47.257 --> 10:51.600
Buttercup! Buttercup!

10:51.674 --> 10:56.725
I need
an ambulance, now! Officer down.

10:56.794 --> 10:59.347
I repeat:
Officer down!

10:59.418 --> 11:01.687
What the hell
did you give my Buttercup?

11:01.753 --> 11:04.087
I just gave him some candy
and some chips...

11:04.154 --> 11:06.739
and some pink popcorn
and some Funyuns...

11:06.809 --> 11:10.322
This horse is a diabetic!

11:10.393 --> 11:14.549
Buttercup. Buttercup.

11:14.618 --> 11:18.229
Don't you leave me.
Breathe, Buttercup.

11:18.297 --> 11:21.559
Breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.

11:23.385 --> 11:26.963
Why?

11:27.033 --> 11:30.962
Why?
Why?

11:33.274 --> 11:35.129
You're under arrest.
What?

11:35.194 --> 11:38.772
You dumb son of a bitch!
No!

11:38.841 --> 11:41.591
I'm aI'm a peaceful man.

11:41.658 --> 11:45.138
I'm a schoolteacher!
Shut up! You're a cop killer.

11:45.209 --> 11:47.892
Cop killer?
I love horses.

11:47.961 --> 11:50.328
I love horses.
I love horses.

11:50.394 --> 11:52.565
I love buttered stuff.
Buttercup.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.488
Say it.
Butter nuts.

11:54.553 --> 11:57.488
Cup. Cup.
Cup. Cup.

12:05.562 --> 12:08.529
Why must you rage?
Stop the hate, child.

12:08.601 --> 12:14.231
Bail is set at one million dollars for
the crime of killing an officer of the law.

12:14.298 --> 12:17.265
And may God have mercy
on your soul, young man.

12:17.337 --> 12:21.876
Court is adjourned.
Back to your cells. Lockdown.

12:27.642 --> 12:29.616
Good night, Fish.

12:29.689 --> 12:33.781
Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish!

12:33.850 --> 12:36.664
My weed's wearing off.

12:42.586 --> 12:45.488
Guess who?
Yo. Psst. Thurgood.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.168
Hey, nigger, what time is it?
It's 8:30.

12:50.233 --> 12:53.364
Kenny didn't come home last night.
We are worried, man.

12:53.433 --> 12:55.288
Word, yo.
Where the hell is he?

12:57.337 --> 12:59.192
Did he just move?

13:02.233 --> 13:05.714
Kenny called. He's in jail.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.793
He didn't leave
a number.

13:07.865 --> 13:10.516
Sincerely,
The Guy on the couch.

13:13.657 --> 13:17.683
Come on, guys. We gotta get Kenny
out of jail, man.

13:20.665 --> 13:22.967
Hey, Kenny. How they
treatin' you in there?

13:23.033 --> 13:26.928
Let's just say I'm not gettin'
the respect a cop killer deserves.

13:27.002 --> 13:28.911
All right, time's up.

13:28.985 --> 13:33.175
I was up all night
getting harassed.

13:33.241 --> 13:36.853
Hi, there, Fish.
See what I mean?

13:36.921 --> 13:41.394
I think they're mistakin'
my kindness for weakness. I'm scared.

13:41.465 --> 13:45.938
Hey, Kenny, we're gonna get you
out of there, man.

13:46.010 --> 13:49.076
All we gotta do is raise ten percent
of one million, yo.

13:49.145 --> 13:53.236
Which, by our calculations-
Is fucking impossible, man!

13:53.305 --> 13:55.215
Hey!

13:55.289 --> 13:57.526
Sorry, man. I'm sorry.

13:57.593 --> 13:59.895
All my life,
I did everything right.

13:59.961 --> 14:03.790
I never screwed up.
I fed the horse.

14:03.865 --> 14:07.826
I didn't know it was a diabetic.
I'm scared.

14:07.897 --> 14:11.028
Kenny, stop crying.
Stop crying, Kenny. Look at me.

14:11.097 --> 14:13.618
Come on. Don't let them
see you cry in there.

14:13.690 --> 14:15.729
Come on, man. Show me your mean face.
No.

14:15.801 --> 14:17.841
Yes, show me
your mean face, Kenny.

14:20.185 --> 14:23.120
That's good.

14:23.194 --> 14:26.096
I mean, work on it a little bit,
but it's good.

14:26.169 --> 14:30.293
Kenny, how long
can you make it in there?

14:30.361 --> 14:35.250
I don't know.
Maybe 5:00... 6:30.

14:37.817 --> 14:40.687
Come on, man. It's gotta be
a little longer than that.

14:40.761 --> 14:43.990
But-ButBut we'll get you out,
right, guys?

14:44.057 --> 14:48.084
Yeah, you're out. You're out of here.
Free as a bird.

14:48.154 --> 14:50.259
Number nine, time's up!

14:50.330 --> 14:53.177
Time's up, number nine.
That's me.

14:54.489 --> 14:56.344
Let's go.

14:58.521 --> 15:00.376
I love you guys.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.383
Have fun, Ken.

15:02.457 --> 15:04.311
Weed out there, yo.

15:04.377 --> 15:06.711
He looked all right, man.

15:07.002 --> 15:09.336
They gonna kill
him in there, yo.

15:09.401 --> 15:13.558
Hey, lady.
Miss, is this your purse?

15:13.625 --> 15:15.926
Yes.
I'm sexy.

15:15.994 --> 15:18.449
I'm a scholar.

15:18.522 --> 15:22.515
People like me.
Give it to me.

15:22.585 --> 15:25.171
Bye.
Hey, where you goin'?

15:25.242 --> 15:29.104
I'm leaving.
Well, uh, can I leave with ya?

15:29.177 --> 15:31.828
Follow me.

15:32.922 --> 15:34.929
And your name is?

15:35.001 --> 15:37.903
Mary Jane.
Really?

15:37.977 --> 15:40.846
Yes. So what's up
with this?

15:40.921 --> 15:43.888
Is that your work uniform?
Nah, this is my costume.

15:43.961 --> 15:47.409
Tomorrow I'll be a cowboy,
the day after that an Indian.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.815
Every day of the week, I dress up
like a different Village Person.

15:49.881 --> 15:52.751
It's a thing I'm into.

15:52.826 --> 15:56.786
Nah, I'm a custodian.
So, what are you here for?

15:56.857 --> 15:59.956
Possession of narcotics.
Wow.

16:00.025 --> 16:03.254
My father's a drug dealer.
Wow, that must've been the shit.

16:03.321 --> 16:07.380
It ruined his life.
That must've been shitty.

16:07.449 --> 16:09.838
I don't do drugs.
Drugs make me sick.

16:09.913 --> 16:13.174
They're bad for your body.
Up with hope, down with dope.

16:13.242 --> 16:15.892
Thurgood. Come on, man.
We gotta go.

16:15.961 --> 16:18.863
Get on the train.
Toke up before we go to work.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.326
Yo, let's go, B.

16:21.401 --> 16:25.143
What are you doing, man?
Bouncy. Body.

16:25.209 --> 16:27.184
Is that Prell?
Do you use Prell?

16:27.257 --> 16:30.290
Yeah. That's what
I'm talkin' about.

16:31.865 --> 16:35.214
Hey, guys. Meet Mary Jane.

16:35.289 --> 16:37.296
That's what he's sayin'.
We wanna burn one.

16:37.369 --> 16:41.264
No, no.
This is Mary Jane.

16:41.337 --> 16:44.304
Meet her. Say hello to her.
Shake her hand even.

16:44.377 --> 16:46.744
Oh, my fault. What's up?
Hi.

16:46.809 --> 16:49.973
All right.
Hey.

16:50.041 --> 16:53.237
Listen, do you guys need a ride?
I have a car.

16:53.305 --> 16:57.015
You don't have to take the subway.
Wow, you smoke?

16:57.081 --> 17:01.751
No, my grandmother died of lung cancer.
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:01.817 --> 17:05.012
Well, that's all the more
reason to toke up, man. Ease the pain.

17:05.080 --> 17:07.830
Ah! What I'm talkin' about.

17:09.817 --> 17:14.551
You know, I think what they're tryin'
to say is we'd love a ride home.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.722
Great.

17:16.792 --> 17:19.182
What the hell's wrong with y'all?
She looked good.

17:19.257 --> 17:23.348
Mary Jane! What is that about, man?
I hate y'all.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.490
Shotgun!

17:27.608 --> 17:31.471
Hey, thanks for this ride. We really appreciate it.
Sure.

17:31.545 --> 17:36.466
Guys, shut up about the weed for two seconds.
I don't want this girl to know I smoke.

17:36.537 --> 17:38.708
Yeah, it's bad enough
you're a janitor, yo.

17:38.777 --> 17:41.079
Custodian, dick.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.208
Hey!
Hey.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.618
It's really real

17:50.681 --> 17:52.536
It's really real

17:52.601 --> 17:55.284
Said they're lookin'
for brains, guts, looks and skills

17:55.353 --> 17:57.622
Step on up if you think you fit the bill
Yeah

17:57.689 --> 18:00.438
I know what you look like
but looks can be deceivin'

18:00.505 --> 18:03.189
Let me check the brain
so I can justify the reason

18:03.257 --> 18:05.112
Yeah
Mister

18:05.177 --> 18:07.032
This good for ya?

18:07.097 --> 18:10.512
Could you drop me
in the lobby? It's perfect.

18:10.585 --> 18:12.789
I could feel
she wanted me to say something.

18:12.857 --> 18:15.246
I had to make my move
while the guys were asleep.

18:15.321 --> 18:19.511
I'm real bad at this, but you think
sometime we could get together,

18:19.577 --> 18:22.294
maybe go out for some ice cream
or something?

18:24.505 --> 18:27.801
Motherfucker said, "ice cream"!

18:27.865 --> 18:30.036
Damn.
Okay!

18:30.105 --> 18:34.328
All the boys in the car need to get out.
Such a dork, man.

18:34.393 --> 18:36.433
I'm talkin' to you.
Thanks a lot, fellas.

18:36.505 --> 18:39.571
Thanks for the ride.
Thurgood!

18:39.641 --> 18:41.975
I knew it!
You forgot your hat.

18:42.041 --> 18:44.529
I knew it.

18:44.601 --> 18:48.496
You know, I might've came on too strong
with the whole ice cream thing.

18:48.569 --> 18:50.935
Let me just give you my number.
Is that cool?

18:51.001 --> 18:52.856
Okay.
All right.

18:52.921 --> 18:55.888
Now, don't call too late, 'cause you
know I be strippin' in the evenings.

18:55.961 --> 18:57.816
Joking!

18:59.033 --> 19:01.651
Here you go.
You can call me anytime you want.

19:01.721 --> 19:05.779
Maybe.
"Maybe" is an acceptable answer.

19:05.849 --> 19:09.078
It's that "no" thing that gets me.
Maybe I'll hear from you.

19:09.145 --> 19:11.119
Bye.
Be thinkin' about you.

19:15.353 --> 19:18.451
Dr. Kablecki,
please report to Clinical Studies.

19:18.521 --> 19:20.376
Dr. Kablecki.

19:20.441 --> 19:22.776
Janitor? Janitor?

19:22.841 --> 19:24.696
Aaah!

19:24.761 --> 19:27.063
Sorry about that.
What is it, scientist?

19:27.129 --> 19:29.812
Could you, uhI know this
isn't your responsibility,

19:29.881 --> 19:34.136
but would you be a dear and run
this down to the supply department?

19:34.201 --> 19:36.470
It's on the second floor.
Just run this down?

19:36.537 --> 19:39.952
Yes. But make sure you bring
the order right back to me.

19:40.025 --> 19:41.912
I need it A.S.A.P.

19:41.977 --> 19:46.646
Got ya. I know this isn't your responsibility,
but mop the rest of this shit up.

19:46.713 --> 19:48.688
I'll be right back.

19:49.945 --> 19:53.775
What it smell like? Smell like...

19:53.849 --> 19:55.758
No.

19:55.833 --> 19:59.346
No. I smell weed, man.

19:59.417 --> 20:02.613
Hey. Here you go.

20:03.865 --> 20:06.898
This all you need?
I guess. I don't know.

20:07.992 --> 20:09.967
Just a sec.
Okay.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.561
Damn.

20:12.633 --> 20:16.725
Either someone's having a party, or
somebody gotta do their shirt laundry.

20:16.793 --> 20:19.760
Here you go.

20:19.833 --> 20:24.372
One pound of marijuana,
and you can sign for it right here.

20:26.936 --> 20:29.806
II sign for this,
and it's mine?

20:29.881 --> 20:32.117
And I take it?

20:35.001 --> 20:38.034
Oh, yeah.

20:42.296 --> 20:44.718
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

20:44.793 --> 20:47.826
Some good shit.

20:47.897 --> 20:53.364
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank... you.

20:55.801 --> 21:01.300
Look, here'shere's a little
something for your troubles.

21:02.329 --> 21:05.176
Thank you. Thank you.
Shh!

21:05.240 --> 21:08.175
Let's not tell anyone
about it, okay?

21:08.249 --> 21:10.104
Sure. Shh.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.928
Hey, why didn't you tell me
you were into this shit?

21:15.001 --> 21:18.000
We could've been hangin' out months ago.
No, no, no.

21:18.072 --> 21:22.928
The Food and Drug Administration are
having us do a study to determine what,

21:23.001 --> 21:27.060
if any, are the medicinal purposes
of marijuana.

21:27.129 --> 21:29.911
Mmm. Wow.

21:29.977 --> 21:31.864
If you ever need
a guinea pig, let me know.

21:31.929 --> 21:34.482
My grandfather was
in the Tuskegee experiments.

21:34.553 --> 21:36.407
Oh, really?

21:36.472 --> 21:39.734
Anyway, thank you,
janitor. Enjoy.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.648
Thank you, scientist.
Got any papers?

21:46.361 --> 21:49.809
No cocktail party would be
complete without the ice plant.

21:49.881 --> 21:52.848
Hey, fellas.
What's goin' on?

21:52.921 --> 21:54.776
What's up?
Nothin', man.

21:54.841 --> 21:56.750
Bummin', thinkin' about Kenny.

21:56.824 --> 21:59.792
Yeah.

21:59.864 --> 22:02.799
I got some weed at work today,
if y'all wanna try it out.

22:02.873 --> 22:05.328
Nah, yo. We don't feel like
smokin' right now.

22:05.401 --> 22:09.362
Me neither. Me neither.

22:18.169 --> 22:20.689
So, y'all want to smoke?
I'll get Billy Bong Thornton.

22:20.761 --> 22:22.932
That's what I'm talkin' about.
No, Scarface.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.204
No Billy Bong Thornton
without Kenny.

22:25.272 --> 22:30.357
That would not be right, man.
Use Wesley Pipes. Yeah.

22:34.809 --> 22:37.559
Man, they got whole bunch
of this stuff at work.

22:37.625 --> 22:40.145
One of those scientists
gave it to me.

22:40.217 --> 22:44.145
Ain't tried the shit out yet,
but it smells like the bomb.

22:44.216 --> 22:47.697
All right.
Yeah, man. Yeah.

22:47.768 --> 22:49.678
I'll do the honors.

22:49.753 --> 22:52.436
Excuse me.
Please do.

23:05.177 --> 23:07.730
Yo, this shit
must be good, B.

23:07.801 --> 23:10.135
My man ain't coughed like
that since back in the day.

23:15.673 --> 23:18.837
You sure I should
do this, man?

23:21.753 --> 23:24.753
Oh, yeah. That shit made
my head hot.

23:24.825 --> 23:26.680
Oh, man.

23:28.440 --> 23:32.117
Pass it this way.
Don't break the cipher.

23:32.185 --> 23:34.606
Ohhold it.
I gotta give The Guy some of this.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.885
The Guy gotta taste this.

23:36.953 --> 23:39.287
Yeah.
Hey, Guy.

23:39.352 --> 23:44.208
Hey, man. Sorry to wake you,
but you gotta try this.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.466
I'm takin' it slow, man.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.211
Hey, who's
on munchies tonight?

24:00.281 --> 24:03.542
We should make
that lazy bitch, The Guy, go.

24:03.608 --> 24:07.503
For real. I don't know about y'all,
but I can't even move.

24:07.577 --> 24:09.649
Real, B, right?

24:09.720 --> 24:12.371
It's like
I feel stuck here, yo.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.190
I'm glued to the floor.

24:33.112 --> 24:35.501
You guys feel
like you're floating?

24:35.576 --> 24:38.064
Yeah. Yeah.

24:40.057 --> 24:43.024
Wanna go outside?
Yeah.

24:55.001 --> 24:57.389
I don't need to
tell you this, but this weed was...

24:57.464 --> 25:00.115
the shiz-nittle-bam
snip-snap-sack!

25:02.680 --> 25:05.550
Look!
Wow, look at that!

25:05.625 --> 25:07.796
Hey, you guys.

25:07.864 --> 25:10.679
Let's go check in
on Kenny, huh?

25:14.232 --> 25:17.266
You're not a fish. You're a man.

25:17.336 --> 25:21.527
You're not a fish.
You're a man.

25:25.081 --> 25:27.252
Where did that come from?

25:27.320 --> 25:30.484
We've really gotta get
this guy out of jail.

25:30.552 --> 25:35.702
You walk around
on both legs, homo erectus!

25:35.768 --> 25:40.307
Did I say "homo"?
I didn't mean that!

25:40.377 --> 25:43.988
Thurgood!
Thurgood!

25:47.001 --> 25:49.935
I got it! I know how
we could get Kenny out.

25:50.008 --> 25:52.048
How?
Weed, man.

25:52.121 --> 25:54.609
We'll sell weed.

25:54.681 --> 25:56.721
Man, you can't up
and decide to sell weed.

25:56.792 --> 25:59.542
You gotta know people to plug you
into that kind of thing.

25:59.608 --> 26:01.496
I do!
Who you know?

26:01.561 --> 26:04.146
You, yo.
Me?

26:04.216 --> 26:06.583
What, you think I can just walk in
and take this shit?

26:06.648 --> 26:09.104
I gottaI gotta get
a form from a scientist.

26:09.177 --> 26:13.748
Well, how hard can it be, man?
There's gotta be forms laying around.

26:13.816 --> 26:16.882
I mean,
they are scientists.

26:16.952 --> 26:19.603
What the fuck
are you talkin' about, man?

26:19.672 --> 26:24.407
Look, I'm not stealin' weed.
We are not sellin' weed.

26:24.472 --> 26:27.669
We are three
reasonably bright young men.

26:27.737 --> 26:29.592
Bully, man.
Word, yo.

26:29.657 --> 26:33.781
There has got to be a legitimate way
to come up with this money.

26:33.849 --> 26:36.336
We just gotta think.
That's all that is.

26:43.737 --> 26:45.591
Hmm.

26:45.656 --> 26:47.631
Mm-hmm.

26:51.833 --> 26:54.680
Wait. Wait.
I think I got an idea.

26:54.744 --> 26:58.519
Why don't we sell that shit
we smoked the other night, yo?

26:58.584 --> 27:01.006
Yeah.
You suggested that already.

27:01.081 --> 27:04.015
For real, B?

27:04.088 --> 27:06.455
Marijuana affects the memory.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.692
It won't take us
hardly any time, B.

27:09.881 --> 27:12.630
Too risky, man.
Stop bein' such a wussy, yo.

27:12.697 --> 27:15.414
What other choice do we have, right?
Yeah.

27:15.481 --> 27:18.001
Okay, fine. Fine.
We'll do it.

27:18.072 --> 27:22.196
Yeah.
Gonna do it till Kenny's out, and we're done.

27:22.264 --> 27:25.580
We're not drug dealers.
We're fund-raisers.

27:25.656 --> 27:28.558
Of course, B.
Bully, man.

27:28.632 --> 27:30.705
Okay.

27:30.776 --> 27:34.224
Scarface, lay it
on me, brother.

27:34.296 --> 27:36.947
Check it out, yo.
It's like this.

27:37.016 --> 27:39.983
Scarface's plan wasn't that bad.

27:40.056 --> 27:42.707
Hey, good night, Mike.
See you tomorrow.

27:42.776 --> 27:45.459
Good night.

27:45.528 --> 27:50.165
All I had to do was get forms from that
scientist that kept calling me janitor,

27:50.232 --> 27:53.877
forge one of the forms and put
the order in like I did before.

27:53.944 --> 27:57.010
Thank you.
Then we scraped together what little money we had...

27:57.080 --> 28:00.244
and bought bikes
to help us move the product,

28:00.312 --> 28:04.687
then stapled samples of our weed
on the back of our business cards.

28:04.760 --> 28:09.332
Then we called the company Mr. Nice Guy
in honor of our friend Kenny.

28:09.401 --> 28:12.881
Hey, uh, you guys believe
in angels or...

28:12.952 --> 28:15.440
Man, give me
your fruit cocktail.

28:18.424 --> 28:20.279
Well, I can't.

28:20.344 --> 28:22.613
If I did that, then I'd have
to give it to you every day,

28:22.681 --> 28:25.266
and I won't get
all my vitamins.

28:25.336 --> 28:28.882
Do you know who you're dealing with?
Chill, Nasty Nate.

28:28.953 --> 28:32.847
He's my bitch. Anybody gonna
stab him, it's gonna be me.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.571
You got a problem with that?

28:38.616 --> 28:42.839
Watch your back, Fish, 'cause Squirrel Master
ain't gonna be there for you all the time.

28:42.904 --> 28:46.930
'Cause next time I come for you,
I'm gonna want some cocktailfruit.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.455
Take it.

28:53.561 --> 28:55.416
I'm somebody's bitch.

29:00.152 --> 29:04.146
You guys gotta do something. There's this
guy Nasty Nate who's after my cocktail fruit,

29:04.217 --> 29:06.071
and everyone here
likes fresh fish.

29:06.137 --> 29:09.715
And then the Squirrel Master came out
of left field and told me I'm his bitch.

29:09.784 --> 29:13.493
Help!
Ken, listen. We got a plan.

29:13.560 --> 29:18.230
What is it?
It's not the most honest plan. You might not like it.

29:18.296 --> 29:21.908
We gonna sell weed, yo.
Yeah, great. Weed. Good. Go.

29:21.976 --> 29:25.424
All right, man.
Go!

29:25.496 --> 29:27.951
No more window love.
Go and sell it.

29:28.024 --> 29:31.188
We figured the best way to
spread the word was to hit the streets.

29:31.256 --> 29:34.070
And hit the streets we did.

29:34.136 --> 29:37.169
Mary Jane
How y'all feel about Mary Jane

29:37.240 --> 29:41.583
Y'all don't know about Mary Jane
Mary Jane

29:41.657 --> 29:45.039
So listen to what they say
'cause Mary never could trip

29:45.112 --> 29:48.560
Mary very, very necessary
Extraordinary bein' Mary

29:48.633 --> 29:52.146
To the mortuary, One kiss from
her sweet lips and out come a-vision

29:52.217 --> 29:54.638
Three for dinner.

29:55.801 --> 29:57.840
Smoke that
and get back to us.

29:57.912 --> 30:02.135
Mr. Nice Guy has arrived, baby.
He's on.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.975
All right.
I'm in love with Mary Jane I'm not the only one

30:06.040 --> 30:09.171
Oh, yes.
Mary likes to play around

30:09.240 --> 30:11.412
Look at all these people!

30:11.480 --> 30:14.796
All right, guys. Be quick.
Let's just do this and get out of here.

30:14.872 --> 30:18.134
Let's go, man. -
Let's go. It's money.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.055
Mary likes to spread her love

30:20.120 --> 30:22.705
And turn my head around

30:22.776 --> 30:24.816
I'm in love with Mary Jane

30:24.888 --> 30:30.191
She is my main thing
She make me feel all right

30:30.265 --> 30:33.112
She make my heart sing
All right, how'd you guys make out?

30:33.176 --> 30:36.405
Good. I'm all out of cards, B.
Me too.

30:36.472 --> 30:39.156
That would make three of us.

30:39.224 --> 30:41.777
All right.
We did our part, right?

30:41.848 --> 30:43.823
I just hope they smoke it.

30:46.744 --> 30:49.810
If you love me, Mary Jane
Mary Jane

30:49.880 --> 30:51.735
We're talkin' about Mary Jane

30:51.800 --> 30:53.687
How y'all feel about Mary Jane

30:53.753 --> 30:57.298
Mary Jane
She's my main thing

30:57.368 --> 31:00.816
We're talkin' about Mary Jane
Damn, this weed is good.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.043
Y'all don't know about Mary Jane
Mary Jane

31:05.336 --> 31:07.703
She make my heart sing

31:14.040 --> 31:17.007
This is so-
We are in business, man.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.502
Hold on. Hold on.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.655
Mr. Nice Guy.
Oh, I may have the wrong number.

31:25.720 --> 31:28.087
Um, is Thurgood around?

31:28.152 --> 31:31.927
Speaking.
Oh, hey, hey. It's Mary Jane.

31:31.992 --> 31:34.447
Do you remember? I gave you
a ride home from prison?

31:34.520 --> 31:36.375
Well, could you be
a little more specific?

31:36.440 --> 31:38.709
I get so many rides home
from prison.

31:38.777 --> 31:40.882
That was a joke.

31:40.953 --> 31:42.840
Oh.

31:42.904 --> 31:45.009
What happened? I didn't think
you were gonna call me.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.975
Well, I wasn't, but then I decided
I don't care what my friends think.

31:50.136 --> 31:52.144
See, that was a joke.
Get it?

31:52.216 --> 31:54.289
A little joke.
Not funny.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.880
So, you wanna
get together?

31:56.952 --> 32:00.400
Okay. Sure. When?

32:00.472 --> 32:04.214
How 'bout right now? Just meet me
at the place you dropped us off at.

32:04.280 --> 32:07.925
Okay. Can you give me
half an hour?

32:07.992 --> 32:09.901
Yeah, half an hour's cool.
Great.

32:09.976 --> 32:12.365
All right. Okay.
I'll see you there.

32:13.656 --> 32:15.827
Bye.
Bye-bye.

32:23.672 --> 32:26.389
I've got a date with Mary Jane!

32:26.456 --> 32:28.311
Word, yo?
Yes!

32:28.376 --> 32:32.533
All right, man.
Y'all got money?

32:32.600 --> 32:35.055
The date couldn't
have come at a worse time.

32:35.128 --> 32:37.332
I was flat broke.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.214
All my money was tied up
in our drug-dealing venture.

32:40.280 --> 32:44.557
I only had eight bucks. This was gonna
take some careful budgeting and maneuvering.

32:44.632 --> 32:47.632
Hey.
Watch the master at work.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.322
You look great. You look wonderful.
Thank you.

32:50.392 --> 32:53.207
You know what? I was thinkin'
it's so nice out,

32:53.272 --> 32:55.606
wanna go for a walk?

32:55.672 --> 32:58.771
Yeah, sure.
We can go for a walk.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.695
Good. Good. Let's.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.833
So far, so good.

33:02.904 --> 33:08.120
Three hours and 14 miles later,
I hadn't spent one penny.

33:08.184 --> 33:10.159
Damn, I was good!

33:10.233 --> 33:13.266
And then it happened.
I'm hungry too.

33:13.336 --> 33:17.744
Hey, you wanna eat at the Happy Palace?
Uh, how 'bout a hot dog, huh?

33:17.816 --> 33:20.401
Hey, what luck.
Hot dog.

33:20.472 --> 33:25.393
Hey, what can I get you?
Could I have a hot dog with ketchup and sauerkraut?

33:25.464 --> 33:28.181
Sauerkraut's 50 cents extra.
Damn!

33:28.248 --> 33:31.117
I've not had a hot dog
in so long.

33:31.192 --> 33:34.040
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Anything to drink?

33:34.104 --> 33:37.039
You son of a bitch!
Yes. Could I have a Pepsi, please?

33:37.112 --> 33:40.975
Anything for you, sir?
No. I'm fine. Thank you.

33:41.048 --> 33:44.463
Greedy bastard!
Didn't you promise me ice cream the other day?

33:44.536 --> 33:47.286
I know a really
good place uptown.

33:47.352 --> 33:49.392
Great. Let's hoof it.

33:49.464 --> 33:53.239
Um, do you mind if we take
a cab this time?

33:54.264 --> 33:56.119
Sure.

34:01.112 --> 34:03.000
Thanks a lot, buddy.

34:03.064 --> 34:05.071
You should be happy
with the tip I gave you. Damn.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.959
You should be kissing my ass.
You guys are greedy.

34:08.024 --> 34:09.911
Best ice cream in town.

34:09.976 --> 34:13.074
Spare change for some food?
Oh.

34:13.143 --> 34:17.399
Don't mind if I do.
Thanks, young brother.

34:17.464 --> 34:20.050
No, thank you.

34:21.431 --> 34:26.833
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.
Yeah, I mean, I do miss my dad.

34:26.904 --> 34:30.547
But... he deserves
to be where he is.

34:30.616 --> 34:33.300
Drug dealers belong
in jail.

34:33.368 --> 34:35.702
Yeah. Yeah, wow.

34:35.768 --> 34:39.150
Yeah. Um, how long
he been in there?

34:39.224 --> 34:42.092
Four years next month.
Four years.

34:42.168 --> 34:45.397
And what exactly was he sellin'?
Marijuana.

34:45.464 --> 34:48.399
Four years
just for weed? Damn!

34:48.472 --> 34:50.927
Just? No, no, no, no.
Not just.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.099
Marijuana is terrible.
It's a gateway drug.

34:54.168 --> 34:56.143
I mean, everybody knows
that it leads to other stuff.

34:56.216 --> 34:58.671
Yeah, mostly junk food.

35:00.536 --> 35:02.674
You don't smoke weed, do you?

35:04.312 --> 35:06.167
Come on, Mary Jane.

35:06.232 --> 35:10.226
I mean, do I look like somebody
that would smoke... marijuana?

35:10.296 --> 35:12.401
So you swear you don't?

35:12.472 --> 35:14.675
Yeah, sure.

35:14.744 --> 35:19.478
Okay, well, swear on this banana split
that you don't do marijuana.

35:19.544 --> 35:22.293
What? Oh, my God.

35:22.361 --> 35:24.630
Do you swear?

35:26.232 --> 35:29.014
Yes, Mary Jane. I swear.

35:29.080 --> 35:32.048
That you got pretty eyes.

35:32.119 --> 35:33.974
That's good.

35:35.352 --> 35:37.206
That's real good.

35:37.271 --> 35:41.395
I got some booty. I got some booty.
I got some booty.

35:41.464 --> 35:43.373
It was really good too.

35:43.448 --> 35:46.448
Ooh, she was a giver,
a caring nurturer.

35:46.519 --> 35:51.156
She held me in her arms, and it was
like I was 15 years old all over again.

35:51.224 --> 35:54.006
I was hooked on Mary Jane.

35:54.295 --> 35:58.486
The next mornin' the phones blew up like
we were havin' a fuckin' telethon, man.

35:58.551 --> 36:02.196
Everybody in New York was callin'
to get down with Mr. Nice Guy.

36:02.264 --> 36:05.428
We met all kinds of customers,
like this guy here.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.406
He's what we call
an enhancement smoker,

36:07.480 --> 36:11.408
'cause he thinks marijuana
makes every activity that much better.

36:11.479 --> 36:13.552
Mi casa es su casa.
Observe.

36:13.624 --> 36:15.479
You're Scarface, right?
Yeah.

36:15.544 --> 36:17.551
I love Al Pacino, man.

36:17.624 --> 36:20.439
Did you ever see Scent of a Woman?
Yep.

36:22.168 --> 36:26.990
Did you ever see
Scent of a Woman... on weed?

36:27.064 --> 36:31.886
That's the way to see it, man!
It's just whacked! Pow!

36:33.303 --> 36:36.599
Sixty bucks, yo.
That's cool, man.

36:36.664 --> 36:38.519
I got it. I got it.

36:41.048 --> 36:45.423
Did you ever see the back of a $20 bill, man?
Man, I don't know, yo.

36:45.496 --> 36:49.489
Did you ever see the back
of a $20 bill... on weed?

36:49.560 --> 36:51.797
Oh, there's some weird shit
in there, man!

36:51.864 --> 36:53.839
There's a dude sittin' in the bushes.
Does he have a gun?

36:53.912 --> 36:56.051
I don't know, man.
What? What?

36:56.120 --> 36:58.487
Red team go. Red team go.

36:58.552 --> 37:02.065
Just some weird shit, man.
Man, you're fuckin' crazy, yo.

37:02.136 --> 37:04.470
Take your shit.
No, that's cool. Thanks, man.

37:04.535 --> 37:07.732
Hey, yo, wait! Dude, I'm gonna
check out the stars later.

37:07.800 --> 37:12.077
It's really trippy.
Especially on weed, man.

37:12.152 --> 37:15.665
A scavenger smoker is
someone who never has weed of their own.

37:15.736 --> 37:18.224
But as soon as you smoke it,
here they come.

37:18.296 --> 37:20.598
Damn! -
What up? Man!

37:20.664 --> 37:22.769
What's up, dogs? Scoot over.
Let me get in here, man.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.695
What y'all doin'?
Nothin'.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.549
Nothin'?
Yeah, just chillin'.

37:26.616 --> 37:29.266
What's the matter?
Let me inhale it. Let me have some.

37:29.335 --> 37:33.426
All right, man.
Just one hit, you scavenger.

37:33.496 --> 37:35.405
Always come around.

37:41.016 --> 37:42.990
Can't even smoke weed
in peace.

37:44.984 --> 37:47.570
I ain't even into the
motherfucker yet. Back up, brother.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.988
You know we sell this?
I don't know if you knew that.

37:51.063 --> 37:54.380
It's too bad, man.
I just stopped smokin' yesterday.

37:59.576 --> 38:03.089
I'm gonna get up out of here.
Y'all stay up, now. Nice seeing y'all.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.127
Yeah. Look at that shit.
Man.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.055
Then there's the "You
Should've Been There" smoker.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.502
They love talkin' about the old days,
back when weed was grass.

38:11.575 --> 38:14.445
Hell, back in the '60s, we used to
smoke that shit on the street.

38:14.520 --> 38:18.164
Cops didn't say nothin'. Hell, they was
gettin' high too. Everybody was doin' it.

38:18.232 --> 38:20.654
Mm.
It wasn't the thing to do because it was the thing to do, you know?

38:20.727 --> 38:22.832
It was the thing to do
because it got you high.

38:22.904 --> 38:25.718
Can you dig?
I feel ya. That's why I'm doin' it.

38:25.783 --> 38:30.159
I feel it. Man, you're cool
as shit, mister.

38:30.231 --> 38:33.548
I hate to do it, but I gotta
charge you. That's 60 bucks.

38:33.624 --> 38:36.177
Sixty bucks?
Yeah.

38:36.248 --> 38:40.176
Man, I remember when a dime bag
cost a dime, you know what I mean?

38:41.816 --> 38:45.428
You know how much condoms used to cost in them days?
How much?

38:45.496 --> 38:48.049
I don't know.
IWe never used 'em.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.836
We call this kid
the "After School Special" smoker.

38:50.904 --> 38:53.359
He spends all
of his allowance on reefer.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.887
Thanks, little buddy.

38:55.960 --> 38:59.342
Now, in the next room, his father,
an "I'm 40, But I'm Still Cool" smoker,

38:59.416 --> 39:03.344
is tokin' up, trying to figure
out a way to bond with his son.

39:03.415 --> 39:07.027
Isn't that ironic?
Don't you think?

39:07.096 --> 39:10.773
'Course across town, the kid's Nana's
smokin' up, tryin' to ease her glaucoma.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.004
And it's good
for arthritis too.

39:14.072 --> 39:17.138
We made over 20 grand
that first week, man.

39:17.208 --> 39:21.136
And because we were stealin' the weed,
not buyin' it, it was all profit.

39:21.207 --> 39:24.590
But if we were gonna save Kenny,
we had to deliver full-time.

39:24.664 --> 39:27.381
Scarface quit his job.

39:27.448 --> 39:30.066
Still waiting
on that Heifer, Julio.

39:32.696 --> 39:34.736
Fuck you. Fuck you.

39:34.808 --> 39:37.677
Fuck you. You're cool.

39:37.752 --> 39:40.435
And fuck you. I'm out!

39:42.456 --> 39:46.678
Brian was gonna quit,
but they fired him before he could.

39:54.680 --> 39:59.153
Don't worry. Don't worry.

39:59.224 --> 40:02.672
I'm not gonna do what
everyone thinks I'm gonna do:

40:02.743 --> 40:05.874
Flip out, man!

40:05.944 --> 40:10.548
All I wanna know is:
who's comin' with me?

40:13.368 --> 40:16.237
Who's comin', man?
Who's comin' with me?

40:17.368 --> 40:21.329
Huh? Who's comin' with me, man?

40:22.456 --> 40:26.165
I will.
Jan.

40:26.231 --> 40:30.060
Thank you, Jan. Yeah.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.549
That's what
I'm talkin' about.

40:34.615 --> 40:37.397
Bully, man. Yeah.

40:43.224 --> 40:47.566
Jan, will you be
my girlfriend?

40:47.640 --> 40:51.415
I would... but I'm gay,
you know?

40:51.480 --> 40:53.389
Ohh.
I'm a big dyke.

40:53.463 --> 40:55.318
What's that like?

40:55.383 --> 40:57.904
Thank you for calling.
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

40:57.976 --> 41:00.975
We had to hire that girl Jan
'cause she followed Brian.

41:01.047 --> 41:02.935
But it actually worked out.
Mr. Nice Guy.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.131
She was more organized than we were,
and she was willing to work for weed.

41:06.199 --> 41:08.054
All right, then.

41:08.119 --> 41:11.502
Mr. Nice Guy
was blowin' up, man.

41:11.576 --> 41:14.642
We got customers
from all over New York.

41:14.712 --> 41:17.362
We even stole a few from Samson.
Oh, what's up, nigger?

41:17.431 --> 41:20.279
Come on in, man.
Come on, weed man.

41:20.343 --> 41:22.198
Thanks, baby.

41:22.263 --> 41:25.111
Get on. Beat it.
You're scarin' him.

41:25.176 --> 41:28.852
Ha! Sir Smoka Lot.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.059
What can I get you today, Smoka Lot?
Love weed.

41:31.127 --> 41:33.975
Um, let me get a pound
of your sweetest chiva.

41:34.039 --> 41:37.268
Damn. Yes! Somethin' told me
to bring a lot of weed, man.

41:37.335 --> 41:41.808
Aw, shit. Pound
of my sweetest chiva.

41:41.879 --> 41:44.727
Don't get no better than that.
Can smell it through the bag.

41:44.792 --> 41:47.247
That's gonna be
9,600 bucks, bro.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.360
Let's see what I got here.

41:52.439 --> 41:55.123
Come on, man. Hang out
for a minute. Smoke with me.

41:55.192 --> 41:57.581
I got weed. I got my bong out.
Come on, son.

41:57.656 --> 42:00.972
For you, man,
I'll stay for a minute.

42:01.048 --> 42:03.633
But then I gotta be-
gotta be goin'.

42:03.703 --> 42:06.486
I understand.

42:06.551 --> 42:11.505
And Smoka Lot opened up to me like I
was Barbara Walters. It was ridiculous.

42:11.575 --> 42:16.397
He told me about his lawyer.
He had sex with my mama! Why?

42:16.472 --> 42:20.116
His spirituality.
God, if you listenin'... help!

42:20.184 --> 42:22.671
His bad back.
Doctor said I need a backeotomy.

42:22.743 --> 42:26.453
His love life.
I'm impotent, man. Get away from me, bitch!

42:26.520 --> 42:29.553
I mean, talk about a guy with problems.
Tough break.

42:29.623 --> 42:33.485
I can't take it no more.
No wonder he smokes a pound a week.

42:33.559 --> 42:37.137
Somebody?
So now we had a famous clientele and...

42:37.207 --> 42:39.062
Greeneyes gonna miss ya.

42:39.127 --> 42:43.088
And guess what else?
Call me next week... about weed, about weed.

42:43.159 --> 42:46.454
I got more booty!
I got more booty!

42:46.520 --> 42:49.269
I don't mean
to rub it in, folks.

42:49.335 --> 42:51.223
It's just that, you know,
I liked this so much, man.

42:51.288 --> 42:54.070
When I was with her,
I didn't even think about weed.

42:54.135 --> 42:56.274
Didn't have to.
Bye.

42:56.343 --> 42:59.791
She was all the Mary Jane I needed.

42:59.864 --> 43:02.133
When I was young

43:02.200 --> 43:06.128
I never needed anyone

43:06.199 --> 43:10.160
Makin' love
was just for fun

43:10.232 --> 43:12.468
Those days are gone

43:15.415 --> 43:20.118
All by myself

43:34.295 --> 43:38.932
What did I tell you, Nate?
Come on. Come on.

43:38.999 --> 43:41.585
Come on. Come on, Nate.

43:41.656 --> 43:44.306
He had to stay vigilant.

43:44.375 --> 43:48.402
Wash off your hanKenny's
butthole was in constant jeopardy.

43:48.472 --> 43:51.090
But we were makin' money.
Hey, what's up, mates?

43:51.160 --> 43:53.745
What's up, man?
What's up, boy?

43:53.815 --> 43:56.565
What's up, yo?
Nada. I'm just chillin'.

43:56.631 --> 43:59.947
Hey, guys. Why is there a dog
biting The Guy?

44:00.023 --> 44:03.820
'Cause I bought a dog, B.
Bought a dog?

44:03.895 --> 44:06.830
For how much?
Oh, it's cool. Yo, he's used.

44:06.903 --> 44:09.391
Including the house,
it was only 250, yo.

44:09.463 --> 44:12.692
You spent $250
on a used dog?

44:12.759 --> 44:15.410
And a dog house, yo.
Brian bought something too.

44:15.479 --> 44:20.465
For $400, I got Jerry Garcia
in a pouch, man.

44:20.535 --> 44:24.430
Who the hell told you that?
The guy who sold it to me. Barry Garcia.

44:24.504 --> 44:26.642
And what he's supposed to be?
Jerry Garcia's brother?

44:26.711 --> 44:30.989
No. Actually,
it's Andy Garcia's brother.

44:31.064 --> 44:34.992
Why the hell are you guys spendin'
money? We're not drug dealers, remember?

44:35.064 --> 44:39.985
We're fund-raisers. Well, you said
you gave Mary Jane a pearl necklace.

44:40.056 --> 44:42.543
How much did that cost, man?
Ah.

44:42.615 --> 44:46.161
You know, obviously you missed
the point of that story, Brian.

44:46.232 --> 44:48.687
Come on, guys. Return this shit.
We can't, yo.

44:48.760 --> 44:52.654
Why am I tellin' Mary Jane I don't have any money?
'Cause you're a fibber.

44:52.727 --> 44:56.023
No, because we don't
have any money.

44:56.088 --> 44:58.128
The money we do have
is not for spending.

44:58.200 --> 45:02.510
It's for saving Kenny's
sweet virgin ass, man!

45:02.583 --> 45:06.926
If you guys spend one more dime,
I swear I will bitch-slap you.

45:08.119 --> 45:09.974
Gimme that.

45:11.575 --> 45:15.372
Sorry for yelling.
But I'm serious.

45:15.447 --> 45:19.538
We gotta start
bein' more responsible and focused.

45:19.607 --> 45:21.844
All right? Let's be sharp.

45:21.911 --> 45:25.326
Scarface, your dog is mean, man.

45:25.399 --> 45:27.308
I know, all right.

45:27.383 --> 45:30.383
Somebody gotta do somethin'
about this shit right now.

45:30.455 --> 45:32.310
Mmm. Come here, doggie.

45:32.375 --> 45:34.863
Hey, little fella. Smell it?

45:34.935 --> 45:39.758
Hey! Smell it.
Okay. All right. Mm.

45:39.831 --> 45:42.003
Good boy.

45:42.071 --> 45:44.886
He likes it.
He loves it, man.

45:44.951 --> 45:48.366
Of course he loves it.
Yeah, your paws are tingling, aren't they?

45:48.439 --> 45:51.439
Now you're one of us.

45:53.015 --> 45:56.049
Get it, Killer.

45:56.119 --> 46:01.553
He likes it, yo.
Yeah, man, he really likes it.

46:01.623 --> 46:05.168
Good for you, man.
Man, what did you guys do to him, yo?

46:05.239 --> 46:08.535
Nothin', man.
Yo, Killer. Kill! Killer, kill!

46:16.695 --> 46:19.346
This weed is fantastic!

46:23.640 --> 46:25.745
We kept pluggin' away
with the weed deliveries,

46:25.815 --> 46:29.427
and we kept meetin' different kinds
of smokers, like this lady.

46:29.496 --> 46:31.797
She's an "I'm Only Creative If I Smoke" smoker.
Hi.

46:31.863 --> 46:35.693
She believes weed, and only weed,
brings out the artist in her.

46:37.111 --> 46:39.729
Would you like to hear some of my poetry?
Not really.

46:39.799 --> 46:41.709
You really should.

46:43.575 --> 46:47.350
I have killed.
I have helped kill.

46:47.415 --> 46:52.685
I have killed part of myself.
I cannot change this, I.

46:52.759 --> 46:56.272
I must seek Buddha.
I must seek Christ.

46:57.879 --> 47:02.484
You must seek therapy. That's what
I would go with, but that's my own...

47:02.552 --> 47:06.294
The MacGyver smoker
is a very handy guy to have around,

47:06.359 --> 47:08.214
especially when it comes
to reefer.

47:09.303 --> 47:11.507
Hey, man,
we're out of papers.

47:11.575 --> 47:15.470
All right. Then get me a toilet paper
roll, a corkscrew and some tin foil.

47:15.543 --> 47:18.390
We don't have a corkscrew.

47:18.456 --> 47:21.903
All right. Then get me an avocado,
an ice pick and my snorkel.

47:21.975 --> 47:25.521
Trust me, bro.
I've made bongs with less. Hurry up!

47:25.591 --> 47:27.980
And then you got your
straight-up potheads. Ooh!

47:28.055 --> 47:30.990
You can spot these people
by their lack of motivation,

47:31.063 --> 47:35.765
mood swings, forgetfulness and,
of course, the dreaded low sperm count.

47:35.831 --> 47:40.174
I don't know which one of these categories
we fall into, but I'll tell you this:

47:40.247 --> 47:42.353
We ain't no goddamn potheads.

47:42.423 --> 47:44.113
Hmm.

47:44.184 --> 47:46.223
Shit.

47:46.487 --> 47:48.658
Then you have
the avid nonsmoker.

47:48.727 --> 47:52.208
A lot of times they'll get your number
accidentally from one of their girlfriends,

47:52.279 --> 47:55.093
call up and place an order
knowing they don't smoke weed...

47:55.159 --> 47:57.679
and request
that you personally deliver it.

47:57.751 --> 48:02.028
Then when you get there, they're
all mad that it's you sellin' weed.

48:02.103 --> 48:06.838
You smoke weed? At last
we can share everything.

48:06.903 --> 48:10.645
Get off me, you Iying
son of a bitch! What is this?

48:10.712 --> 48:13.013
Looks like some sort
of a business card.

48:13.080 --> 48:16.724
Yeah, with your number on it.
You know, I can't believe this!

48:16.791 --> 48:20.468
I can't believe that I fell for another
one of you lowlife assholes again.

48:20.535 --> 48:23.535
God, what is wrong with me?
Hey...

48:23.607 --> 48:26.029
Hey, Mary Jane, I can explain
everything, all right?

48:26.103 --> 48:28.208
Good-bye, Thurgood.
Wait! Hold up!

48:28.279 --> 48:30.221
Hey, Mary Jane!

48:30.295 --> 48:34.452
Mary Jane, look, the only reason
I lied to you was because I like you...

48:34.519 --> 48:36.373
and I wanted
to be with you.

48:37.399 --> 48:39.254
Mary Jane.

48:49.943 --> 48:51.798
Knight Rider.

48:51.863 --> 48:54.351
A shadowy flight
into the dangerous world...

48:54.423 --> 48:57.423
of a man who does not exist.

49:00.471 --> 49:03.668
Thurgood, why the long face, man?

49:03.735 --> 49:06.223
Mary Jane dumped me.
Shh. Quiet down, yo.

49:06.295 --> 49:09.197
Sir Smoka Lot's on TV.
Cecil?

49:09.271 --> 49:13.069
When life is hard, I pick up
that card with the smiley face

49:13.143 --> 49:16.721
Call him over to my place

49:19.191 --> 49:21.908
Box it
Man, it gets you high

49:21.975 --> 49:24.593
And that's
when things started going wrong.

49:24.663 --> 49:29.519
Samson, it looks like somebody
is cuttin' into your business, baby.

49:29.591 --> 49:33.649
Shit.
Do you like what you see, Samson?

49:33.719 --> 49:35.574
Do I look like
I like what I see?

49:36.599 --> 49:39.349
Who is this
Mr. Nice Guy?

49:39.415 --> 49:42.317
I would imagine he's
some sort of drug dealer.

49:42.391 --> 49:44.366
Go get me this Mr. Nice Guy.

49:44.440 --> 49:47.636
I wanna sit him down
and ask him some questions.

49:51.511 --> 49:53.900
Hey, Squirrel Master.
Kenny.

49:55.255 --> 49:58.931
Listen, uh, I, uh,
just wanted to say thank you...

49:58.999 --> 50:01.333
for protecting me back there.

50:01.399 --> 50:05.141
We didn't mind.
Huh? Did we, Fuzzy Nuts?

50:05.207 --> 50:08.590
I hope there's some way I can pay
you back when we get on the outside.

50:08.663 --> 50:11.729
You better hurry up.
I get out in 11 days.

50:11.799 --> 50:13.839
Is that right?

50:19.031 --> 50:22.773
Kenny, 11 days?
That seems a little stiff, man.

50:22.840 --> 50:26.156
Eleven days, Thurgood,
I'm as good as skewered.

50:26.231 --> 50:29.580
Ever take your clothes off
and run backwards through a cornfield?

50:29.655 --> 50:32.111
Ooh.
Hurry, Thurgood.

50:32.183 --> 50:35.479
I'm countin' on you, man!
Please! Please!

50:35.543 --> 50:38.477
Eleven days wasn't
gonna give us much time.

50:38.551 --> 50:41.999
We really had to hustle, and
that meant takin' on new customers.

50:55.415 --> 50:59.277
Damn, B! I been set up.

51:02.295 --> 51:04.564
We'll get back to that in a second.

51:04.631 --> 51:07.926
But meanwhile I hadn't seen
Mary Jane in, like, a week.

51:07.991 --> 51:11.220
I couldn't stop thinkin'
about her, man. I missed her.

51:11.287 --> 51:15.957
Then I started thinkin' about the fact that she
was the only girl I slept with in five years.

51:16.023 --> 51:19.023
Then I started thinkin' about the girl
I slept with before Mary Jane.

51:20.919 --> 51:23.407
I had to get Mary Jane back.

51:23.479 --> 51:27.221
What do you want?

51:28.311 --> 51:30.864
I want you back, Mary Jane.

51:30.935 --> 51:35.692
I miss you. I'll do whatever
it takes to get you back.

51:35.767 --> 51:38.581
I can't quit sellin' it yet,
but I'll quit smokin' it.

51:38.647 --> 51:41.843
If that's what you want, then-
then I'll change for you.

51:41.911 --> 51:45.075
Heard that before.
Said that before.

51:45.143 --> 51:49.169
But this time I mean it. I'm gonna
come back here. I'm gonna be clean.

51:49.239 --> 51:52.501
I'm gonna be sober.
There's no more weed, no more nothin'.

51:52.567 --> 51:57.040
Mary Jane, you'll see.
I'll be back. I'll be a changed man.

51:57.111 --> 51:59.413
There's a new
Thurgood Jenkins today.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.537
I love you.

52:03.607 --> 52:06.127
Man, that first day
of sobriety sucked.

52:06.199 --> 52:10.956
And I realized something: I was a real
irritable guy when I wasn't smokin' marijuana.

52:11.031 --> 52:13.813
I couldn't stop thinkin'
about gettin' high.

52:13.879 --> 52:16.246
It was time to get help.

52:16.311 --> 52:19.540
Hi, everyone.
My name is Thurgood.

52:19.607 --> 52:23.798
Hi, Thurgood.
Hi.

52:23.862 --> 52:28.336
I'm here today because
I'm addicted... to marijuana.

52:28.407 --> 52:31.920
You in here because of marijuana?

52:31.991 --> 52:33.965
Marijuana?

52:34.039 --> 52:36.690
Man, this is some bullshit!

52:36.759 --> 52:38.646
Marijuana is not a drug.

52:38.710 --> 52:42.289
I used to suck dick for coke.
I seen him!

52:42.359 --> 52:44.213
And that's an addiction, man.

52:44.279 --> 52:46.351
You ever suck dick for marijuana?
Huh?

52:48.631 --> 52:52.243
No. No, I can't say I have.
I didn't think so.

52:52.311 --> 52:55.093
Boo this man!
Boo!

53:04.374 --> 53:06.447
No.

53:06.519 --> 53:11.564
No!

53:11.639 --> 53:13.614
Devil man.

53:13.686 --> 53:17.331
Devil666-
The mark of the beast!

53:17.399 --> 53:20.465
No! Naughty!

53:20.535 --> 53:23.055
Naughty jungle of love!

53:25.783 --> 53:28.598
The man is serious.
Calm down. How serious can it be?

53:28.663 --> 53:31.478
He wants to see Mr. Nice Guy.
He told me.

53:35.511 --> 53:37.365
Oh, man.

53:39.542 --> 53:41.811
No, yo!

53:41.879 --> 53:43.886
They killed Killer, B!

53:45.111 --> 53:47.696
Yo, Samson did this, man.

53:48.727 --> 53:51.477
Yo, he killed Killer, man.

53:51.543 --> 53:54.325
Hey.
He killed...

53:54.391 --> 53:56.846
I'm gonna call Brian.

53:56.919 --> 53:59.669
Let's just give him
a proper burial, all right?

53:59.735 --> 54:02.102
I'm sorry, man.

54:02.167 --> 54:04.022
Jesus Christ.

54:04.087 --> 54:07.731
Oh! I'm sorry.
Watch it, man! You stepped on his head!

54:07.799 --> 54:10.613
I'm sorry.
I didn't even see him.

54:42.391 --> 54:45.326
I gotta smoke.
I have got to smoke.

54:46.359 --> 54:48.660
What happened, man?

54:48.727 --> 54:51.956
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

54:52.023 --> 54:55.252
Samson and his girls
came rollin' up in here lookin' for me.

54:55.319 --> 54:58.483
They was gonna mess me up
if I didn't bring them Mr. Nice Guy.

54:58.551 --> 55:00.973
So they probably
roughed the Guy up,

55:01.046 --> 55:03.534
then they started
goin' to war with the apartment.

55:03.607 --> 55:06.803
They had num-chuks, bolos.
They be doin' Indian burns.

55:06.871 --> 55:09.292
Killer paid the price, yo.

55:09.367 --> 55:13.458
He got the wrath. He got
the wrath of the num-chuks, yo.

55:14.455 --> 55:18.164
I think it's more complex
than that.

55:18.230 --> 55:22.508
More complex than that?
You know what I think happened?

55:22.583 --> 55:25.681
You want to hear
what I think, man?

55:27.607 --> 55:31.469
First of all, to understand
what happened to Killer,

55:31.543 --> 55:35.536
you gotta understand
who Killer the dog was.

55:35.606 --> 55:38.923
Now, Killer was born
to a three-legged bitch mother.

55:38.998 --> 55:41.846
He was always
ashamed of this, man.

55:41.911 --> 55:46.450
And right after that, he's adopted
by this man, Tito Liebowitz.

55:46.518 --> 55:49.104
He's a small-time gunrunner...

55:49.175 --> 55:51.346
and, uh,
rottweiler fight promoter.

55:51.414 --> 55:55.026
So he puts Killer into training.
They see Killer's good.

55:55.095 --> 55:57.135
He is damn good.

55:57.207 --> 56:00.982
But then he had
the fight of his life.

56:01.047 --> 56:04.276
They pit him against
his brother Nibbles.

56:04.343 --> 56:08.020
And Killer said, "No, man, that's
my brother. I can't fight Nibbles!"

56:08.087 --> 56:10.771
And he made 'em fight anyway.

56:10.839 --> 56:13.522
And then Killer,
he killed Nibbles.

56:14.551 --> 56:17.202
And Killer said, "That's it."

56:17.271 --> 56:22.639
He called off all his fights, and he
started doing crack, and he freaked out.

56:22.711 --> 56:26.769
And then in a rage,
he collapsed,

56:26.838 --> 56:28.944
and his heart...

56:29.014 --> 56:31.153
no longer beat.

56:33.143 --> 56:35.282
Wow.

56:35.351 --> 56:37.652
You know, uh,

56:37.719 --> 56:40.533
I never thought I'd say
this to anybody,

56:40.599 --> 56:43.948
but you two smoke
entirely too much reefer.

56:44.022 --> 56:47.056
What if The Guy did it?

56:47.127 --> 56:49.647
No way. You think?

56:49.719 --> 56:51.574
Yo?

56:55.415 --> 56:58.382
Yo, The Guy,
did you kill my dog?

57:03.255 --> 57:06.550
I believe him, yo.
I don't know why, but I do.

57:11.191 --> 57:13.046
Samson did this shit, yo.

57:16.662 --> 57:18.834
Mr. Nice Guy,
Party Accessories.

57:18.903 --> 57:21.292
Well, did you get
my message?

57:21.366 --> 57:25.295
Who is this?
This is Samson, smarty-pants.

57:25.367 --> 57:27.985
Operator with an
emergency breakthrough from your sister.

57:28.055 --> 57:30.640
Samson, this is Sheila. Mama fell...

57:30.710 --> 57:32.565
Shut up, bitch!

57:32.630 --> 57:36.143
You tell Mr. Nice Guy
to get his Jamaican ass...

57:36.214 --> 57:39.084
over to my place
at 3:00 tomorrow!

57:39.158 --> 57:43.250
Now, you don't want me to get ugly.
No, sir.

57:43.319 --> 57:45.872
Shit.
All right. I'll tell 'em.

57:47.159 --> 57:49.363
Oh, my God.

57:49.431 --> 57:52.114
We're in a lot of trouble.

57:52.182 --> 57:56.077
Scarface, perhaps
you could help me.

57:56.151 --> 58:00.461
Why do you think Samson thinks
that Mr. Nice Guy's a Jamaican?

58:00.535 --> 58:03.883
Oh, 'cause I told him
Mr. Nice Guy was Jamaican, yo.

58:03.958 --> 58:09.076
Why?
I just thought he sounded Jamaican inside my head.

58:09.143 --> 58:11.794
We're in a lot
of trouble, guys.

58:11.863 --> 58:16.173
We have a meeting with Samson tomorrow at
3:00. Where are we gonna get a Jamaican?

58:16.247 --> 58:19.662
I'll pretend
I'm Jamaican, man.

58:19.735 --> 58:21.590
Yeah.

58:23.319 --> 58:25.653
You have smoked yourself
retarded.

58:30.007 --> 58:35.374
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Mr. Nice Guy.

58:36.663 --> 58:39.346
Welcome to my lair.

58:39.414 --> 58:43.276
Well, now. Tell me
a little bit about yourself.

58:45.911 --> 58:50.482
Well, you know, I be from
Jamaica, man. Lord have mercy.

58:50.550 --> 58:52.689
What part of Jamaica?

58:52.758 --> 58:55.955
Right near the beach-
Boy

58:56.023 --> 58:59.154
I think
you're bullshitting me.

58:59.222 --> 59:02.517
Samson Simpson,
I stick by my story!

59:02.582 --> 59:04.437
I'm from Jamaica.

59:04.502 --> 59:09.838
If I wasn't Jamaican, then why
would I wear this hat? Hmm?

59:09.910 --> 59:11.951
Delilah,

59:12.982 --> 59:16.146
get me 814.

59:16.214 --> 59:18.800
814.

59:18.871 --> 59:21.685
What the fuck is 814?

59:26.422 --> 59:32.085
Oh! I'm sorry, y'all. I don't want to be
the first nigger to die from a crossbow.

59:32.151 --> 59:35.467
You know, I have been
Iying to you.

59:35.543 --> 59:39.340
I'm sorry.
Samson, I'm sorry. Okay?

59:39.414 --> 59:42.284
WeWe just started this
because our friend got locked up.

59:42.359 --> 59:45.654
Brother, you know how that is.
We had to get him outta jail.

59:45.718 --> 59:48.052
Now this
is what's gonna happen.

59:48.119 --> 59:51.250
You make about 40,000,
50,000 a week.

59:51.318 --> 59:53.707
Shit. I wish.

59:53.783 --> 59:56.336
Well, I want half,

59:56.407 --> 01:00:00.018
$20,000 a week,
or you're dead!

01:00:00.087 --> 01:00:02.159
You understand?

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:06.420
Twenty thousand seems fair.
That seems fair, right guys? It's fair.

01:00:06.486 --> 01:00:08.974
Class dismissed.

01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:13.617
Man, we are
in trouble, man.

01:00:17.334 --> 01:00:22.931
Jerry, I really need
your help, man. Feel us...

01:00:22.998 --> 01:00:27.188
Brian, will you stop praying to
a bag of sand, man? Come on.

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:33.133
You heard the man. If we don't
get this money, we're dead. All of us!

01:00:36.182 --> 01:00:40.011
Yo, Thurgood, why don't you get your
boy, The Guy, to lend you some money?

01:00:40.086 --> 01:00:43.501
You certainly let him stay here long enough.
Man, that's Brian's boy.

01:00:43.574 --> 01:00:47.371
I didn't let him stay here.
I don't know him, man.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.732
Hey, what day is it?
Saturday.

01:00:55.798 --> 01:00:57.653
Is it January?

01:00:57.718 --> 01:01:00.369
No, man, it's August.

01:01:00.438 --> 01:01:03.253
Oh, wow. August.

01:01:03.318 --> 01:01:05.969
Hey, I couldn't help
overhearing you guys.

01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:10.611
You know, if you want to double
your profits, you should rob that lab.

01:01:10.679 --> 01:01:12.883
Tomorrow's Sunday.
There'll be no one in there.

01:01:12.951 --> 01:01:15.798
Just go in and rob
the place blind.

01:01:15.862 --> 01:01:17.717
It'll work, I promise you.

01:01:20.439 --> 01:01:23.700
Hey, uh, seein' as how
we don't know who you are,

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:26.734
are you plannin'
on movin' out anytime soon?

01:01:26.807 --> 01:01:30.669
Thurgood, why don't you just
focus on one thing at a time?

01:01:30.743 --> 01:01:34.834
I'll be fine. The robbery
is what's important now.

01:02:11.574 --> 01:02:13.429
Phase One is complete, yo.

01:02:13.494 --> 01:02:15.698
All right.

01:02:15.767 --> 01:02:19.215
Now all we gotta do is go down this
hatch to the second-floor supply room.

01:02:19.286 --> 01:02:22.003
Grab all the weed you can grab,
and we are outta here!

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.925
Sick, man!
This is it?

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.845
Let's do it.

01:02:25.911 --> 01:02:27.765
Watch your step.

01:02:36.694 --> 01:02:39.760
You didn't say nothin' about no door, yo.
Chill out, man.

01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:43.442
I smoke weed here all the time.
This door's never locked.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.931
I didn't say the alarm would be off.

01:02:46.006 --> 01:02:48.974
I said it never locked.
Well, hurry, yo!

01:02:49.046 --> 01:02:51.217
You guys, wait up!

01:02:53.399 --> 01:02:55.253
Oh.

01:02:55.319 --> 01:02:57.522
Hold up!

01:02:57.591 --> 01:03:01.714
Isn't that Thurgood, the custodian?
Yeah.

01:03:01.782 --> 01:03:05.939
Want me to call the cops?
No. This is too much fun.

01:03:06.006 --> 01:03:08.111
Right over here!
Come on!

01:03:13.878 --> 01:03:15.733
I hope there's some left.

01:03:29.462 --> 01:03:33.139
Maui Wowie!

01:03:46.934 --> 01:03:50.196
I never seen this much weed
in my life! Let's go!

01:03:54.262 --> 01:03:56.401
Come on, man!

01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:13.714
Get down on your knees with
your hands behind your head.

01:04:13.782 --> 01:04:17.099
Yo, I'm gonna make
a run for it, B.

01:04:17.175 --> 01:04:19.062
Just get down, man.

01:04:22.454 --> 01:04:24.658
At least Brian
got away, yo.

01:04:24.726 --> 01:04:29.515
Whoa! My nads! Oh!

01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:33.456
Hey, thank God, man!

01:04:33.526 --> 01:04:36.493
Get down on your knees with
your hands behind your head!

01:04:38.006 --> 01:04:39.861
Move in.

01:04:43.062 --> 01:04:45.396
Breaking and entering.

01:04:45.462 --> 01:04:47.350
You got me?
Open and shut.

01:04:47.414 --> 01:04:49.934
I say we book 'em.
You got me? We book 'em.

01:04:50.006 --> 01:04:53.781
Hey, wait a minute, guys.

01:04:53.846 --> 01:04:57.523
It's not open and shut.
What do you guys do for a living?

01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.979
I'm a detective.
Yeah, we're detectives.

01:05:00.054 --> 01:05:03.371
Oh. Okay then, detect.
Ask us somethin'.

01:05:03.446 --> 01:05:07.603
What do you know about this new Jamaican, this Mr. Nice Guy?
Yeah.

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:10.703
Aw, shit, yo.

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:15.084
Well, I heard he's got great weed,
but that's neither here nor there.

01:05:15.158 --> 01:05:18.060
I mean, we can't bring him down.
Crazy.

01:05:18.134 --> 01:05:20.501
But we can
bring you Samson.

01:05:20.566 --> 01:05:24.014
Just ask me how. Ask me!

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:26.835
How are you gonna
bring Samson down?

01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:29.805
We got a meeting with him
in a couple days.

01:05:29.879 --> 01:05:31.951
I'll wear a wire. Hmm?

01:05:32.022 --> 01:05:36.015
All right, listen to me.
There's $30,000 in this knapsack.

01:05:36.086 --> 01:05:38.420
When you get in there,
give him the 20 grand you owe him,

01:05:38.486 --> 01:05:41.420
and with the remaining ten,
buy whatever narcotics he's got around.

01:05:41.494 --> 01:05:44.593
You got me?
You paying attention?

01:05:44.662 --> 01:05:47.345
No. Sorry, man.

01:05:47.414 --> 01:05:50.448
Unless you say out loud what it
is you're buying, we got nothin'.

01:05:50.518 --> 01:05:54.129
So make sure that you say it, and make
sure that you get Samson to say it.

01:05:54.198 --> 01:05:56.053
No codes. No slang.
Yeah.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:06:00.274
As soon as you got the stuff, or if anything
goes wrong, say the phrase, "Abracadabra."

01:06:00.342 --> 01:06:03.310
Abracadabra.
Abracadabra?

01:06:04.822 --> 01:06:07.953
Okay. Okay.
Make sure that you are relaxed.

01:06:08.022 --> 01:06:09.877
And just act
completely normal.

01:06:09.942 --> 01:06:12.593
That's gonna be a problem.
What do you mean?

01:06:12.662 --> 01:06:15.978
I mean we haven't smoked
any weed today, man.

01:06:16.054 --> 01:06:21.205
If the three of us go in there all
clear-eyed, Samson is gonna know somethin's up.

01:06:23.606 --> 01:06:25.940
Well, if you think
it's gonna help.

01:06:26.006 --> 01:06:28.908
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's
gonna help. You got a light?

01:06:33.558 --> 01:06:36.307
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:06:36.374 --> 01:06:39.091
Thanks, Officer.

01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:45.676
I just wanna say,

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:49.547
that was a great idea,
Thurgood.

01:06:49.622 --> 01:06:54.226
Wow. I mean, where do you even-
Just smoke it, yo!

01:06:55.766 --> 01:06:57.937
If somethin' happens to us,
could you...

01:06:58.006 --> 01:07:01.236
could you give this letter
to Mary Jane Potman?

01:07:01.301 --> 01:07:03.189
Sure thing, kid.

01:07:03.254 --> 01:07:08.721
AndAnd tell our friend Kenny Davis
we love him. He's in prison.

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.659
Let's go. Come on.
All right. Let's move.

01:07:12.982 --> 01:07:14.957
Just remember to speak clearly.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.583
Get him to say what he's sellin' you.
Yeah.

01:07:17.654 --> 01:07:19.509
It ain't always good...

01:07:19.574 --> 01:07:22.574
to get high before you have
important things to do.

01:07:22.646 --> 01:07:27.218
Lucky for us,
the cops had our backs.

01:07:27.286 --> 01:07:31.083
Hello, boys.
Hi, Samson.

01:07:31.158 --> 01:07:34.900
So... where's the money?

01:07:34.966 --> 01:07:36.821
Right here in my bag.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.886
Um, Samson, can I
ask you a question?

01:07:39.958 --> 01:07:42.161
Go ahead.

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:45.939
Do you know where we can score
some cocaine?

01:07:46.007 --> 01:07:49.519
You want some candy?
Uh, no, thanks.

01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:53.998
But it'd be great
if we can get some cocaine.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.365
What's so funny?

01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:59.796
Those guys-
Those guys are doomed!

01:07:59.862 --> 01:08:02.251
I can't feel my hands!

01:08:02.327 --> 01:08:04.181
II can feel them.

01:08:08.022 --> 01:08:10.411
What we have here...

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:12.493
is some Columbian heaven.

01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:14.606
Pure cocaine.

01:08:14.678 --> 01:08:17.973
Candy makes you dandy.
Hmm.

01:08:18.037 --> 01:08:21.715
This is all the cocaine
we get for ten G's, B?

01:08:21.781 --> 01:08:24.334
We have other product.
Oh, like more cocaine?

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.429
And that is?

01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:32.593
Fine China. Babaloo.

01:08:32.662 --> 01:08:36.305
Looks like heroin to me, yo.
Yeah. Is that heroin?

01:08:36.374 --> 01:08:39.790
You've got to be the dumbest dealers
in the history of the dope game.

01:08:39.862 --> 01:08:43.157
You mean the game
that you run, yo?

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.774
Good.
Just call me Jesse Owens.

01:08:45.845 --> 01:08:48.693
Jesse, can we get some cocaine
and get the hell outta here?

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:52.620
Okay.
Can I buy some of your heroin too?

01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:55.595
Okay.

01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:57.676
All right. All right.

01:08:57.751 --> 01:09:00.051
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

01:09:00.118 --> 01:09:02.966
Thank you very much for the heroin
and the cocaine. Here's your money.

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:04.622
All right.

01:09:06.805 --> 01:09:08.660
Abracadabra.

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:11.765
Yeah, man!

01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:16.563
Abracadabra.

01:09:19.957 --> 01:09:22.675
"You're all the Mary Jane
I'll ever need."

01:09:25.943 --> 01:09:29.652
Abracadabra, yo!
Oh, abracadabra, man.

01:09:29.718 --> 01:09:34.028
Abracadabra.
Boy, why do you keep saying that?

01:09:34.102 --> 01:09:36.523
What? Abracadabra?

01:09:36.598 --> 01:09:38.770
Yes. Abracadabra.

01:09:38.837 --> 01:09:41.685
It's the latest thing.
All the kids are saying it, all right?

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:44.205
Abracadabra, my brother.
What's up? Abracadabra.

01:09:44.278 --> 01:09:47.693
Abracadabra.
Slim, take off your shirt.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.858
Samson, Samson,
I hardly know you.

01:09:51.925 --> 01:09:54.129
Ladies.
Abracadabra.

01:09:54.197 --> 01:09:56.270
Abracadabra, man!
Abracadabra, yo!

01:09:56.342 --> 01:09:58.993
Abracadabra! Abra...

01:09:59.062 --> 01:10:03.284
You're dead! All of you!

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:06.317
Hey, fellas,
let's beat these bitches!

01:10:32.822 --> 01:10:34.676
Let's work it out.

01:10:40.662 --> 01:10:43.313
Oh, yo, your titty.

01:10:45.429 --> 01:10:48.746
Now, that's a titty.
Fully, man.

01:10:48.821 --> 01:10:51.855
That is an official fully.

01:10:51.926 --> 01:10:53.682
Aah!

01:10:58.294 --> 01:11:03.215
These are mean people. Mean, mean, man.
Look out!

01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:11.507
This is for Killer, B.

01:11:11.574 --> 01:11:15.829
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

01:11:15.893 --> 01:11:17.780
Look who's walkin'.

01:11:19.093 --> 01:11:21.133
Nigger, I thought
you said you was crippled.

01:11:21.206 --> 01:11:25.198
Well, sweet pea,
we're all crippled in some way.

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:28.117
Put it down!
You win.

01:11:28.181 --> 01:11:30.036
Now...

01:11:30.102 --> 01:11:33.298
this is the way
it's gonna work.

01:11:33.366 --> 01:11:36.181
I'm gonna take your little
Mexican friend with me,

01:11:36.246 --> 01:11:38.101
and I'm gonna kill him.

01:11:38.166 --> 01:11:41.068
I'm Cuban, B.
Yes, Cuban B.

01:11:41.142 --> 01:11:46.095
Now is there anything you want to say to your friends?
Jerry, we need you.

01:11:46.165 --> 01:11:48.653
Abracadabra, B!

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:56.565
Oh, man!

01:11:58.805 --> 01:12:01.456
Oh, wow.

01:12:03.062 --> 01:12:06.323
Sucks to be you, man!

01:12:08.022 --> 01:12:10.542
Oh, man! Oh, man!

01:12:10.613 --> 01:12:14.737
What did I-
I told you he was real, man.

01:12:14.806 --> 01:12:18.701
Jerry... thank you, man.

01:12:18.774 --> 01:12:20.661
You're welcome, Brian.

01:12:20.726 --> 01:12:23.147
Peace.

01:12:29.973 --> 01:12:32.756
Well, abracadabra.
Whoa!

01:12:32.821 --> 01:12:35.821
All right.
What the hell's goin' on here?

01:12:35.894 --> 01:12:40.149
Our job is done. These guys can go home.
You guys are wasted, man.

01:12:40.214 --> 01:12:43.443
Thurgood, Thurgood.
Nice letter.

01:12:43.509 --> 01:12:46.291
Gimme that back.
Queer.

01:12:51.893 --> 01:12:53.780
Everybody, freeze!
Oh, shit!

01:12:53.846 --> 01:12:55.700
Nobody move!

01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:02.383
The cops took all the credit for
bustin' Samson, but that's not important.

01:13:02.453 --> 01:13:06.315
What was important is that we cut
a deal, and Kenny was finally free.

01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:09.205
Hallelujah!

01:13:11.349 --> 01:13:13.324
Which brings me
to the Brooklyn Bridge,

01:13:13.398 --> 01:13:16.016
where I had to make things right
with Mary Jane.

01:13:18.998 --> 01:13:22.675
Hi.
Are you?

01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:24.814
A little bit from yesterday,
you know, when Kenny got...

01:13:24.886 --> 01:13:29.556
But-But-But, Mary Jane, listen.
I'm done. I'm done sellin' it.

01:13:29.622 --> 01:13:32.655
I'm done smokin' it.
This is the last of it, right here.

01:13:32.725 --> 01:13:36.238
I just wanted you to see me
get rid of it.

01:13:38.006 --> 01:13:40.340
Could we just have a-
a moment alone?

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:45.550
Do what you gotta do.
Be strong.

01:13:45.622 --> 01:13:47.476
Thanks, baby.

01:13:50.486 --> 01:13:52.395
Mary Jane,

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:56.496
bein' with you these past
11 years has been wonderful.

01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:58.421
But I gotta move on.

01:13:58.486 --> 01:14:02.577
Come on. Smoke me.
Have a quickie for old time's sake.

01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:05.678
No. She's looking.

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:08.335
She's looking.
All right. Real quick.

01:14:11.349 --> 01:14:14.416
No. No! It wouldn't be right.

01:14:14.486 --> 01:14:16.755
Goddamn you!

01:14:19.382 --> 01:14:22.000
You'll be back!

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:24.884
Everything work out okay?

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:28.049
Yeah. Mary Jane, I love you.

01:14:28.118 --> 01:14:29.972
I love you too.

01:14:34.165 --> 01:14:37.514
I know.
I know what you're thinkin'.

01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:41.485
That old Thurgood sold out, right?
I'm your girl now.

01:14:41.557 --> 01:14:45.780
But let me tell you something.
I love weed, okay? I love it.

01:14:47.126 --> 01:14:50.923
But not as much
as I love pussy.

01:14:50.997 --> 01:14:52.852
The End.

01:14:53.878 --> 01:14:57.936
I get lifted up

01:14:57.973 --> 01:15:01.617
High, high, high, high

01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:06.576
I get lifted up

01:15:06.646 --> 01:15:10.290
High, high, high, high

01:15:10.358 --> 01:15:14.187
Sittin' here together, baby

01:15:14.262 --> 01:15:16.116
We're alone

01:15:18.966 --> 01:15:22.763
Now I can tell ya, girl

01:15:22.837 --> 01:15:24.692
You turn me on

01:15:27.317 --> 01:15:31.692
I get lifted up

01:15:31.765 --> 01:15:35.442
High, high, high, high

01:15:35.509 --> 01:15:40.113
I get lifted up

High, high, high, high

01:15:44.022 --> 01:15:47.153
You've got the love that

01:15:47.221 --> 01:15:49.643
The love I desire, babe

01:15:52.341 --> 01:15:54.708
You've got the match

01:15:54.774 --> 01:15:58.450
Ooh, that lights my life

01:16:00.821 --> 01:16:05.076
I get lifted up

01:16:05.142 --> 01:16:09.004
High, high, high, high

01:16:09.078 --> 01:16:13.420
I get lifted up

High, high, high, high

01:16:34.325 --> 01:16:38.580
I get lifted up

01:16:38.646 --> 01:16:42.508
High, high, high, high

01:16:42.581 --> 01:16:46.957
I get lifted up

01:16:47.029 --> 01:16:50.859
High, high, high, high

01:16:50.933 --> 01:16:53.867
You got the love that

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:56.397
The love I desire, babe

01:16:59.477 --> 01:17:01.419
You've got the match

01:17:01.493 --> 01:17:05.748
Ooh, that lights my fire

01:17:07.733 --> 01:17:12.043
I get lifted up

High, high, high, high

01:18:21.429 --> 01:18:23.338
Hey, everybody,
I'm Dave Chappelle.

01:18:23.382 --> 01:18:26.731
If you want to learn more about
marijuana or other illegal substances,

01:18:26.805 --> 01:18:28.660
go to your local library.

01:18:28.725 --> 01:18:32.620
Remember, the more you read-
The smarter you are.

01:18:32.693 --> 01:18:35.214
Yea!

01:18:35.285 --> 01:18:37.489
All right, man.
