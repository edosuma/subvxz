How do you like
my new litter box?

00:18.384 --> 00:20.318
(sinister laugh)

00:20.386 --> 00:23.988
Halloween-- is it just a date
on the calendar

00:24.056 --> 00:27.759
that people from England
don't know about...

00:27.826 --> 00:30.094
or is it a state of mind...

00:30.163 --> 00:32.664
or is it a state of... being?

00:32.731 --> 00:36.401
I, frankly, don't know...

00:36.469 --> 00:39.671
but come along
on our Halloween journey

00:39.739 --> 00:42.841
and maybe by the end,
we'll all know.

00:42.908 --> 00:44.308
(woman screaming)

00:44.376 --> 00:46.845
Is this lining real satin?

01:24.316 --> 01:26.051
Sabrina, could you
help me pick up

01:26.118 --> 01:27.585
some stuff
this afternoon?

01:27.653 --> 01:29.320
"Water balloons,
toilet paper,

01:29.388 --> 01:30.955
dry ice,
rotten eggs"?

01:31.023 --> 01:32.490
One more thing--
could you find out

01:32.558 --> 01:35.159
where the biology lab gets
those pigs in formaldehyde?

01:35.227 --> 01:37.729
Is your mom on another
one of her crazy diets?

01:37.797 --> 01:38.830
Hey, we only have...

01:38.897 --> 01:41.499
33 hours and 12 minutes left
till Halloween night.

01:41.566 --> 01:44.168
We got to start planning
our pranks and tricks <i>now.</i>

01:44.236 --> 01:45.136
I can't.

01:45.204 --> 01:46.404
Dreama and I are
going to go look

01:46.472 --> 01:48.005
for after-school
jobs today.

01:48.107 --> 01:50.341
We figured the best
time to do it would
be <i>after school.</i>

01:50.409 --> 01:51.942
But this could be
our last hurrah.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.311
My dad says that

01:53.378 --> 01:54.513
the Westbridge
city council's

01:54.580 --> 01:55.680
going to make it illegal

01:55.714 --> 01:57.748
for kids over the age of 17
to trick-or-treat.

01:57.816 --> 01:58.783
That's just wrong.

01:58.851 --> 02:00.585
Huh... and I was
going to march

02:00.653 --> 02:02.754
against sweatshop
labor in the Orient,

02:02.822 --> 02:04.222
but now I've got <i>this.</i>

02:05.691 --> 02:08.092
I can't believe
how few glamorous, high-paying

02:08.160 --> 02:09.627
after-school jobs
there are

02:09.695 --> 02:11.830
for inexperienced teenagers.

02:11.897 --> 02:13.198
Life is so unfair.

02:13.265 --> 02:14.199
So...

02:14.266 --> 02:16.500
have you decided
if you're an existentialist

02:16.568 --> 02:17.769
an idealist or a nihilist?

02:17.836 --> 02:20.338
Actually, currently,
I'm an unemployed-ist.

02:20.405 --> 02:23.007
I thought you were
in my philosophy class. Sorry.

02:23.075 --> 02:24.075
Can you believe it--

02:24.143 --> 02:25.943
a real, live college
student was talking to you?

02:26.011 --> 02:27.646
College is going
to be so great.

02:27.713 --> 02:29.981
We'll get to take classes
like philosophy

02:30.049 --> 02:32.017
and hang out
in places like this

02:32.084 --> 02:33.885
with guys who...
take philosophy.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.287
Why don't you
get a job here?

02:35.354 --> 02:36.120
That'd be great.

02:36.188 --> 02:37.355
This place is so cool

02:37.422 --> 02:38.756
and none of the furniture
matches.

02:38.824 --> 02:40.291
Do you know how
to make coffee?

02:40.359 --> 02:42.627
No, but, if my cat can do it
when he's half-asleep,

02:42.695 --> 02:43.761
how hard can it be?

02:43.829 --> 02:45.930
Oh, excuse me, um...

02:45.997 --> 02:47.265
I'd like to speak
to the manager.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.033
You from
the health department?
No.

02:49.101 --> 02:50.001
Then, I'm the manager.

02:50.068 --> 02:51.836
I'm also the cashier,
the table busser

02:51.904 --> 02:52.970
and the bouncer.

02:53.038 --> 02:55.340
As a matter of fact,
you know what they call me?

02:55.407 --> 02:55.840
What?

02:55.908 --> 02:56.841
Josh.

02:56.909 --> 02:59.110
Oh, well, excuse me,

02:59.177 --> 03:01.112
Mr., Uh, Josh, um...

03:01.179 --> 03:02.713
I'm looking for a job.

03:02.781 --> 03:03.681
You are, huh?

03:03.749 --> 03:05.350
You got any experience?

03:05.417 --> 03:06.518
"Experience"?

03:06.585 --> 03:09.086
I travel with my
own Melitta filters.

03:09.154 --> 03:10.855
So, you've got no idea
how to make coffee?

03:10.923 --> 03:12.223
None.

03:12.290 --> 03:12.857
MAN:
Could I get

03:12.925 --> 03:13.991
a little service?

03:14.059 --> 03:14.558
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:14.626 --> 03:15.526
Oh!

03:16.829 --> 03:18.596
Nice save!

03:18.664 --> 03:20.965
If you can pour as well
as you catch, you're hired.

03:21.033 --> 03:22.166
Fantastic!

03:22.234 --> 03:24.335
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

03:24.403 --> 03:25.904
This is going
to make it hard

03:25.971 --> 03:27.671
to negotiate
salary, isn't it?

03:30.208 --> 03:32.476
So... was the roller
coaster scary?

03:32.545 --> 03:33.811
"Scary"?

03:33.879 --> 03:35.847
They make you sign
an organ-donor form

03:35.915 --> 03:37.148
before letting you on.

03:37.215 --> 03:38.482
We rode upside-down

03:38.550 --> 03:41.353
holding boiling soups
and lawn darts.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.286
HILDA:
And still...

03:42.354 --> 03:43.154
not scary.

03:43.222 --> 03:45.156
Here it is
the Halloween season

03:45.224 --> 03:47.758
and we can't find <i>one thing</i>
to scare us.

03:47.826 --> 03:49.193
Perhaps we should give

03:49.261 --> 03:52.830
that dentist who works
without novocaine another try.

03:52.898 --> 03:54.065
In just a few hours,

03:54.132 --> 03:56.768
people will be mistaking me
for Juan Valdez.

03:56.902 --> 03:58.269
All right...

03:58.336 --> 04:00.171
let me know what you think
and be brutal.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.006
Oh... (gags)

04:02.074 --> 04:03.408
Oh, come on,
it can't be <i>that</i> bad.

04:03.475 --> 04:04.275
You try it.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.112
It's fine...

04:08.180 --> 04:10.114
just a little chewy.

04:11.783 --> 04:12.917
It's been decades

04:12.985 --> 04:15.119
since I've enjoyed
the sweet taste of terror.

04:15.187 --> 04:18.156
Your wait has come to an end,
my fright-craving friend.

04:18.223 --> 04:21.259
Suppose the three of us
go to a graveyard

04:21.327 --> 04:23.227
and I'll read
some of the ghost stories

04:23.295 --> 04:25.129
I've written--
<i>The Tales of Salem.</i>

04:26.398 --> 04:29.567
See? The mere prospect
paralyzes you with fear.

04:29.635 --> 04:33.705
No... but your sad little
suggestion gave me an idea.

04:33.772 --> 04:37.542
You know who writes stories
that are truly scary?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.010
Edgar Allan Poe.

04:39.077 --> 04:40.044
You're right.

04:40.112 --> 04:42.580
Hey, let's make use
of our time-travel clock

04:42.647 --> 04:45.116
and invite him
for a Halloween dinner.

04:45.184 --> 04:47.785
Don't tell me you're scared
by sissy-pants Poe.

04:47.853 --> 04:49.687
Are you implying
that the author

04:49.755 --> 04:51.789
of "The Tell-Tale Heart"
isn't scary?

04:51.857 --> 04:53.091
His stories are scary,

04:53.158 --> 04:55.392
'cause I gave him
all his best ideas.

04:55.460 --> 04:56.894
If it weren't
for old Salem,

04:56.962 --> 05:00.331
you'd be shivering
to "The Tell-Tale Kidney."

05:00.399 --> 05:03.201
Okay, here's the correct way
to bus a table.

05:03.268 --> 05:04.568
First, the trash.

05:04.636 --> 05:07.939
Try to avoid screaming "yuck"
at the top of your lungs.

05:08.007 --> 05:10.442
I once saw my vice-principal
in his boxer shorts.

05:10.509 --> 05:11.675
Not a peep.

05:11.743 --> 05:13.411
Next, the mugs,
all right?

05:13.479 --> 05:14.646
I like to pretend

05:14.713 --> 05:17.247
the half-full ones
mean good luck.

05:17.315 --> 05:20.851
And then,
you reach the mother lode--

05:20.919 --> 05:22.853
a whole quarter tip!

05:22.921 --> 05:24.822
You think you can handle
that table?

05:24.890 --> 05:27.091
Yeah. Just hand me
a germ-laden rag

05:27.159 --> 05:28.426
and I'm on it.

05:28.493 --> 05:30.261
Oh, by the way,
I know it's last minute,

05:30.329 --> 05:31.496
but is there
any chance

05:31.564 --> 05:33.831
you could work the night
shift on Halloween?

05:33.899 --> 05:35.633
You mean, while everyone else
is goofing off,

05:35.701 --> 05:36.934
I get to make coffee

05:37.002 --> 05:38.002
and wash dirty cups?

05:38.070 --> 05:39.203
And clean the spill tray.

05:39.271 --> 05:40.804
All this and minimum wage?

05:40.872 --> 05:42.306
Where do I get my shots?

05:42.374 --> 05:43.675
Great news, Hildie--

05:43.742 --> 05:45.276
Edgar Allan Poe
RSVP'd.

05:45.343 --> 05:47.745
We're on our way to
being truly scared.

05:47.812 --> 05:49.947
Oh... he even wrote it
in <i>blood.</i>

05:50.015 --> 05:51.783
Actually,
I think that's red crayon.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.884
Good-- there's scary
and there's gross.

05:53.952 --> 05:54.919
(chuckles)

05:54.987 --> 05:55.987
Hi, Sabrina.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.555
How's our favorite
coffee maker?

05:57.622 --> 05:59.357
Uh, the correct term
is "barista."

05:59.424 --> 06:00.291
I love my job.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.059
College kids are
so sophisticated.

06:02.127 --> 06:03.762
They talk about art
and literature

06:03.829 --> 06:04.862
and foreign films.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.464
By the way,
who's Jack Kerouac,

06:06.532 --> 06:08.466
what's Cubism
and can I get a futon?

06:08.534 --> 06:10.301
Hey, while you're here,
can you give us a hand?

06:10.369 --> 06:11.869
Edgar Allan Poe is
coming for dinner.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.337
We want the house
to be really scary,

06:13.405 --> 06:14.839
so he'll be comfortable.

06:14.906 --> 06:16.841
I thought the sound of clanking
chains might be nice.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.676
(chains clanking)

06:18.744 --> 06:21.279
I was thinking
more along the lines

06:21.347 --> 06:22.379
of thunder
and lightning.

06:22.447 --> 06:23.380
(thunder crashing)

06:23.448 --> 06:24.948
So much for the toolshed.

06:25.016 --> 06:26.150
Let's get
decorating.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.386
It's my turn
to hang up the skeleton.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.520
You're dreaming.

06:29.588 --> 06:31.589
You always get to
hang up the skeleton.

06:31.657 --> 06:32.990
Well, then, it's tradition--
gimme.

06:33.058 --> 06:35.259
Don't make me
separate you two.

06:35.327 --> 06:36.561
What is it about this holiday

06:36.629 --> 06:38.295
that makes people act
so immature?

06:38.363 --> 06:39.964
Well, she
started it.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.398
Pranks and hokey horror stuff.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.201
You know, lucky for me,
I've got plans for Halloween.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.537
I'm going to be working
at the coffee house.

06:46.605 --> 06:47.705
Sabrina, you're a witch.

06:47.773 --> 06:49.273
Witches can't run away
from Halloween.

06:49.341 --> 06:50.208
Watch me.

06:50.275 --> 06:51.643
I'm done
with all this kid stuff.

06:51.743 --> 06:53.177
(man moaning eerily)

06:53.245 --> 06:54.678
Okay, that was ominous.

06:54.746 --> 06:56.347
Yeah, and it didn't
scare me a bit.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.916
Me, either.

06:57.983 --> 06:59.951
SALEM:
You know, I've been thinking

07:00.019 --> 07:02.453
of revising my will
and leaving <i>you</i>

07:02.520 --> 07:04.722
my entire collection
of Pez dispensers.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.557
What do you want?

07:06.625 --> 07:08.626
A ride to the graveyard tonight,
please?

07:08.694 --> 07:09.427
No can do.

07:09.494 --> 07:10.794
I've got to work.

07:10.862 --> 07:12.230
(eerie moaning)

07:12.297 --> 07:14.031
Oh, that's right.

07:14.099 --> 07:16.867
You've got that nice boss--
real generous guy...

07:16.936 --> 07:19.570
always thinking of others,
giving of himself.

07:19.638 --> 07:20.538
Your point?

07:20.605 --> 07:22.073
Think <i>he'd</i> give me a ride

07:22.140 --> 07:23.107
to the graveyard?

07:23.175 --> 07:24.375
You know, I'm
really surprised

07:24.443 --> 07:26.010
our special pumpkin-
flavored coffee

07:26.078 --> 07:27.145
hasn't been
more popular.

07:27.212 --> 07:29.147
You think it has anything
to do with the fact

07:29.214 --> 07:30.748
that it's a hideous
shade of orange

07:30.815 --> 07:32.083
and it tastes
like pumpkin?

07:32.151 --> 07:33.517
BOTH:
Trick or treat.

07:33.585 --> 07:35.085
None of the above.

07:35.153 --> 07:36.153
Great costumes, huh?

07:36.221 --> 07:37.922
You wouldn't believe
how hard it was

07:37.990 --> 07:39.323
to find ones that fit...

07:39.391 --> 07:41.192
and it's flame-retardant.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.393
Aren't you a little
old for this?

07:42.461 --> 07:44.996
Not until the city council
passes that law.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.264
Tonight is going
to be a Halloween

07:47.332 --> 07:48.633
for the record books.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.068
We're going to warm up
by egging Coach Koch's house,

07:51.136 --> 07:52.370
work in a cow-tip or two

07:52.438 --> 07:54.806
and, time permitting,
wrap things up by streaking

07:54.873 --> 07:56.941
across Old Lady Blankenship's
front yard.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.643
I'm glad to see
you've added subtlety

07:58.710 --> 08:00.111
to your bag of
tricks this year.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.113
Hey, Harv, come on,
why are we still standing here?

08:02.181 --> 08:04.148
We should be out there,
burning poop.

08:04.216 --> 08:05.616
Hey, I know how you
love Tootsie Pops,

08:05.684 --> 08:07.051
so I'll save any
I get for you.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.519
Uh, wash your hands first.

08:11.523 --> 08:12.890
Cute kids.

08:12.958 --> 08:15.526
I guess that's what happens
when pregnant women smoke.

08:15.594 --> 08:17.027
Well, I've got to
get to the library

08:17.095 --> 08:18.963
and finish my essay on
Shakespeare's comedies.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.831
I've compared-- now,
I'm ready to contrast.

08:20.899 --> 08:22.666
Wait a minute--
you're going to leave me here

08:22.734 --> 08:23.867
to run things
by myself?

08:23.935 --> 08:25.737
Yeah, that's why I asked
you to work tonight.

08:25.804 --> 08:27.805
I really need
someone I can trust.

08:27.873 --> 08:30.307
The last guy I left here
rented it out to bikers.

08:30.375 --> 08:31.876
But how do you know
you can trust me?

08:31.944 --> 08:34.510
I've only worked here one day
and I have very shifty eyes.

08:34.578 --> 08:35.846
I'll only be a
couple of hours.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.847
I'll be back in time
to help you close up.

08:37.916 --> 08:39.384
But what if someone comes
in here

08:39.451 --> 08:40.784
and wants
to order something?

08:40.852 --> 08:42.318
You give it to them?

08:42.386 --> 08:43.386
I promise you

08:43.455 --> 08:45.490
Halloween night here
is so easy.

08:45.557 --> 08:47.158
The place is a morgue.

08:47.225 --> 08:49.093
(eerie moaning)

08:55.567 --> 08:56.634
Josh was right.

08:56.702 --> 08:57.835
I can handle this...

08:57.903 --> 08:59.604
and he's depending on me...

08:59.671 --> 09:00.738
(eerie moaning)

09:00.806 --> 09:02.073
and that's not scary.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.841
ZELDA:
<i>You're a witch, Sabrina.</i>

09:03.908 --> 09:05.776
<i>You can't run away</i>
<i>from Halloween.</i>

09:05.844 --> 09:07.845
And that's just the onset
of senility.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.548
Uh...

09:10.615 --> 09:11.649
may I help you?

09:11.717 --> 09:14.384
I want to chop you up
in little pieces.

09:14.452 --> 09:15.553
You want what?

09:15.621 --> 09:17.221
I want a cup of coffee.

09:19.858 --> 09:21.124
Okay, I'm just letting

09:21.192 --> 09:23.026
my imagination get
the best of me...

09:23.094 --> 09:25.128
but if I turn around
and he's got an ax,

09:25.196 --> 09:27.064
he loses the benefit
of the doubt.

09:28.366 --> 09:30.434
Okay, um, well,
would you like

09:30.502 --> 09:32.202
to join
our biscotti-of-the-month club?

09:32.270 --> 09:33.770
(cash register keys clicking)

09:33.838 --> 09:35.506
I-I don't think I'll be back.

09:35.574 --> 09:38.342
This coffee's so strong,
it could wake the dead.

09:38.410 --> 09:41.445
(eerie moaning)

09:44.549 --> 09:45.649
"Wake the dead."

09:45.717 --> 09:47.918
What was that guy talking about?

09:47.986 --> 09:50.488
I mean,
this batch was almost liquid.

10:06.771 --> 10:08.639
See? Everything is fine.

10:08.707 --> 10:10.341
So far, I've served
five or six people

10:10.409 --> 10:11.976
and not a single attempt
on my life.

10:12.043 --> 10:12.944
(loud crash)

10:13.011 --> 10:14.111
(screams)

10:14.179 --> 10:15.178
All right, calm down.

10:15.246 --> 10:16.714
It's just the muffin tray.

10:16.781 --> 10:18.549
Muffins aren't remotely scary.

10:18.617 --> 10:19.917
They're fat-free.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.155
I'm going to die!

10:27.258 --> 10:28.793
Hi, Dreama.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.128
Hilda, I'd like you
to meet Mr. Poe.

10:31.196 --> 10:33.430
It's such a pleasure
to meet you.

10:33.498 --> 10:36.066
Thanks for the ride.

10:36.134 --> 10:38.435
That voice--
it's so scary.

10:38.503 --> 10:41.338
May I take your cape?

10:41.406 --> 10:43.207
No garment
could be scarier.

10:43.274 --> 10:45.476
This is the stuff
of nightmares.

10:47.679 --> 10:49.680
The only thing scary
about that cape

10:49.748 --> 10:52.382
is that he died in it
and never had it cleaned.

10:52.450 --> 10:55.386
Well, if no one wants
to listen to my horror stories,

10:55.454 --> 10:59.357
I'll just go
shred some beloved sweaters.

11:05.096 --> 11:06.330
Apparently, an AA
meeting just let out.

11:06.397 --> 11:07.965
Would you mind giving
me a hand back here?

11:08.033 --> 11:10.534
I've never really made
a cappuccino before.

11:10.602 --> 11:11.869
Oh, well, that's where
good, old-fashioned

11:11.937 --> 11:13.771
American ingenuity
comes in handy.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.572
Okay, and a little magic.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.209
Frothy milk,
nice and hot-tay,

11:18.276 --> 11:19.911
whip me up
two lowfat lattes.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.916
(making steaming noise)

11:24.983 --> 11:27.151
Okay, there you go.

11:40.765 --> 11:42.033
There you are.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.268
Listen, Zelda forgot
to pick up the one thing

11:44.336 --> 11:46.937
that will make Edgar Allan Poe
feel at home.

11:47.005 --> 11:48.573
An open bar?

11:48.640 --> 11:50.341
A black cat.
Forget it.

11:50.408 --> 11:51.642
Fine. Then I'll go
with my second choice.

11:53.311 --> 11:56.580
Quoth the raven, "bite me."

11:58.050 --> 11:59.716
Finally, we get
a moment to relax.

11:59.784 --> 12:01.485
I know. You know,
I have to admit

12:01.553 --> 12:03.954
before you got here,
I was feeling sort of...

12:04.022 --> 12:07.325
(thunder crashing)

12:07.392 --> 12:08.725
afraid.

12:11.997 --> 12:14.031
There's nothing to be afraid of.

12:14.099 --> 12:16.267
It's just a severe thunderstorm.

12:16.334 --> 12:18.435
On a calm,
cloud-free evening.

12:18.503 --> 12:20.371
This has nothing to do
with my aunts trying to warn me

12:20.439 --> 12:21.572
that I couldn't avoid Halloween.

12:21.673 --> 12:22.606
(eerie moaning)

12:22.674 --> 12:23.807
Stop that!

12:23.875 --> 12:26.177
Oh, good.
I thought that was my stomach.

12:26.244 --> 12:28.746
What kind of people
go out for coffee

12:28.814 --> 12:30.248
in weather like this?

12:30.282 --> 12:33.283
(moaning and groaning)

12:33.351 --> 12:36.253
The flesh-eating, zombie kind.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.423
(both screaming)

12:39.491 --> 12:41.625
Mmm! Oh!

12:41.693 --> 12:43.794
Ladies, that was the best meal

12:43.862 --> 12:45.129
I've had in years.

12:45.163 --> 12:48.399
In the afterlife,
they don't cook with salt.

12:50.135 --> 12:52.870
Can you believe how
much roast beef he ate?

12:52.937 --> 12:55.306
Talk about the pig
and the pendulum.

12:55.374 --> 12:56.574
And <i>four</i> desserts.

12:56.641 --> 12:58.576
Well, thatll teach
you to serve rum cake.

12:58.643 --> 12:59.743
Still, we're lucky

12:59.811 --> 13:02.245
to have the scariest
writer of all time

13:02.313 --> 13:03.881
as <i>our</i> Halloween guest.

13:03.948 --> 13:06.183
Mr. Poe,
would this be a good time

13:06.251 --> 13:08.219
for you to read us a story?

13:08.287 --> 13:09.921
Absolutely.

13:09.988 --> 13:12.623
If you don't mind,
I'd like to read something new.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.025
(screams)

13:14.092 --> 13:16.827
I'm just practicing.

13:16.895 --> 13:19.096
(pounding)

13:19.164 --> 13:20.430
I could be wrong,

13:20.498 --> 13:22.065
but I don't think
that lock was built

13:22.133 --> 13:24.068
to withstand an onslaught
from the undead.

13:24.135 --> 13:25.402
What are we
going to do?

13:25.470 --> 13:26.304
I don't know.

13:26.371 --> 13:27.304
Wait a minute.

13:27.372 --> 13:28.606
We're witches.

13:28.673 --> 13:31.108
I don't feel like visiting
with walking corpses today.

13:31.175 --> 13:32.743
Please make
those zombies go away.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.378
(pounding)

13:34.446 --> 13:36.046
Uh-oh.

13:36.114 --> 13:37.214
We're going to have
to get rid of them

13:37.282 --> 13:38.148
the old-fashioned way.

13:38.216 --> 13:39.050
What's that?

13:39.117 --> 13:40.217
Help! Help! Help!

13:40.285 --> 13:41.886
Help! Help! Help! Help!

13:41.953 --> 13:43.887
(thunder crashing)

13:43.955 --> 13:45.990
(chains clanking)

13:46.057 --> 13:47.992
Zelda, would you mind
turning down your thunder?

13:48.059 --> 13:49.660
If you turn down
your clanking chains.

13:49.728 --> 13:50.627
(clearing throat)

13:50.695 --> 13:51.761
Very well.

13:51.829 --> 13:53.830
A poem by Edgar Allan Poe.

13:53.898 --> 13:55.766
(phone rings)

13:55.833 --> 13:57.434
What is that ringing?

13:57.502 --> 13:59.269
A telephone.

13:59.337 --> 14:01.872
That's how we
communicate these days.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.741
Haven't you people
ever heard of e-mail?

14:03.809 --> 14:05.208
Salem, get the phone!

14:05.276 --> 14:07.277
Go ahead
and curdle our blood.

14:07.345 --> 14:09.313
(spitting)

14:09.381 --> 14:13.517
(mimicking Hilda):
Salem, we're too busy
being scared out of our wits

14:13.585 --> 14:14.919
to answer the phone.

14:14.986 --> 14:16.319
(normal voice):
Hello.

14:16.387 --> 14:17.955
Salem, exactly what
did my aunts mean

14:17.989 --> 14:20.224
when they said that
I couldn't avoid Halloween?

14:20.292 --> 14:21.992
I'm fine. How are you?

14:22.060 --> 14:22.893
Salem!

14:22.961 --> 14:24.628
If you run away from Halloween,

14:24.695 --> 14:25.662
Halloween will find you--

14:25.730 --> 14:27.865
and it won't be happy.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.067
Oh! And... and once
Halloween has found you,

14:30.135 --> 14:32.002
how do you get it to unfind you?

14:32.070 --> 14:33.838
That'll require research.

14:33.905 --> 14:35.572
(growling)

14:35.640 --> 14:37.807
Do it, and hurry!

14:37.875 --> 14:40.411
Right. Like I've got
nothing better to do

14:40.478 --> 14:42.813
than save
your anti-Halloween butt.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.318
Of all the ways to go--

14:47.385 --> 14:48.686
death by zombie!

14:48.753 --> 14:50.554
I can't bear to look!

14:53.091 --> 14:53.924
What are they doing?

14:53.992 --> 14:55.559
Are they clawing
at our flesh?

14:55.626 --> 14:57.494
(music playing)

14:57.562 --> 14:59.896
Actually, they're
having a party.

14:59.964 --> 15:02.066
(loud dance music playing)

15:04.336 --> 15:07.071
¶ ¶

15:12.911 --> 15:15.546
(screaming)

15:33.165 --> 15:34.397
(screams)

15:42.007 --> 15:45.375
¶ ¶

16:15.206 --> 16:17.541
¶ ¶

16:26.817 --> 16:28.285
I'm so fired!

16:28.352 --> 16:29.553
Josh is going to
be back any second

16:29.620 --> 16:30.588
and I'm pretty sure

16:30.655 --> 16:32.122
zombies are messier
than bikers.

16:32.190 --> 16:33.123
(phone rings)

16:33.191 --> 16:35.025
Excuse me.

16:35.093 --> 16:38.161
Oh! Oh! Sorry. Ooh!

16:38.229 --> 16:40.397
Ugh! Just because
their bodies are rotting

16:40.465 --> 16:42.867
doesn't mean they can't shower
once in a while.

16:42.934 --> 16:44.167
Hello.

16:44.235 --> 16:45.702
SALEM:
Here's the deal.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.137
To get out of your predicament,

16:47.205 --> 16:49.506
you have to experience
the <i>fun</i> of Halloween.

16:49.573 --> 16:52.876
<i>Fun?</i> I'm up
to my arms in... arms!

16:52.944 --> 16:54.778
If I may suggest some fun,

16:54.880 --> 16:57.447
think of a trip to the graveyard

16:57.515 --> 16:59.616
to listen
to Salem's horror stories.

16:59.651 --> 17:00.717
(dial tone)

17:00.785 --> 17:01.951
Hello?

17:02.019 --> 17:03.287
(growling)

17:03.354 --> 17:04.755
What fresh hell is this?

17:04.823 --> 17:06.123
You don't understand.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.159
My boss trusted me
to keep an eye on this place.

17:09.227 --> 17:10.560
If he comes back and it's not...

17:10.627 --> 17:11.494
(screams)

17:11.563 --> 17:12.963
This is what happens

17:13.030 --> 17:15.265
when you try to reason
with someone who's decaying.

17:15.333 --> 17:16.800
Toilet paper!

17:16.867 --> 17:18.836
Oh, great, just what I need--

17:18.970 --> 17:20.403
more Halloween fun.

17:20.471 --> 17:21.872
Wait a minute.

17:21.939 --> 17:22.906
That <i>is</i> what I need.

17:22.973 --> 17:24.374
It's Harvey and Brad.

17:24.442 --> 17:26.777
Harvey, quit TP'ing the
Christian Science Reading Room

17:26.810 --> 17:28.078
and get over here!

17:28.146 --> 17:31.482
Interesting clientele.

17:31.549 --> 17:32.749
What's that smell?

17:34.186 --> 17:36.186
This is our last year we
can trick-or-treat, right?

17:36.254 --> 17:37.287
So let's make it count.

17:37.355 --> 17:38.655
Gee, Sabrina,

17:38.723 --> 17:40.857
we thought you were
too mature for Halloween.

17:40.925 --> 17:43.026
Oh, stop talking
and start TP'ing.

18:04.549 --> 18:05.315
They're leaving.

18:05.383 --> 18:06.383
Woo-hoo! We broke the spell.

18:06.451 --> 18:08.318
Oh, wait.

18:08.386 --> 18:10.954
Who forgot their foot?

18:11.022 --> 18:13.023
What did I tell you
about Sabrina's pranks?

18:13.091 --> 18:15.192
Her family takes
Halloween very seriously.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.494
And you keep telling
me they're not weird.

18:17.561 --> 18:19.129
Harvey, you were
right, you know?

18:19.197 --> 18:21.198
Why not just loosen up
and enjoy Halloween

18:21.265 --> 18:22.366
as long as little kids

18:22.433 --> 18:24.101
aren't making fun
of us to our faces?

18:24.169 --> 18:25.936
You're the best.

18:27.238 --> 18:28.571
POE:
<i>"I love you enough</i>

18:28.639 --> 18:30.374
"to let you walk,

18:30.442 --> 18:33.777
"but I love you too much
to let you run.

18:33.844 --> 18:35.746
"But you don't want to walk.

18:35.813 --> 18:38.248
"You want to run.

18:38.316 --> 18:40.317
Let's skip."

18:40.385 --> 18:41.718
Part 17.
Excuse me,

18:41.786 --> 18:42.719
Mr. Poe.

18:42.787 --> 18:43.820
I don't mean

18:43.888 --> 18:45.288
to interrupt,
but we thought

18:45.357 --> 18:47.891
that you were going
to read us something less <i>dull.</i>

18:47.959 --> 18:50.594
She means
something scary.

18:50.661 --> 18:51.828
Horror?

18:51.896 --> 18:54.097
I haven't done that tripe
in years.

18:54.165 --> 18:57.701
There's a much bigger market
in inspirational writing.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.169
Is that what this is?

18:59.237 --> 19:00.737
Hilda, he's our guest.

19:00.805 --> 19:02.372
We have to be polite.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.809
"Rainbows and sparkles,
kittens in a box..."

19:05.877 --> 19:08.044
He's going down.

19:08.112 --> 19:08.912
See you guys later.

19:08.979 --> 19:09.880
And, uh...

19:09.948 --> 19:11.181
don't let all
the crickets loose

19:11.249 --> 19:13.450
in Mr. Kraft's house
till I get there.

19:14.952 --> 19:17.254
Okay, a quick cleanup,
and I'm home free.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.788
So I don't get fired
and take a lot of flak,

19:18.856 --> 19:20.524
please help me clean up
before my boss gets...

19:20.591 --> 19:21.558
Sabrina?

19:21.626 --> 19:23.560
Oh... Josh. Hi.

19:23.628 --> 19:25.195
What happened
to this place?

19:25.263 --> 19:27.063
Look at all
this toilet paper.

19:27.131 --> 19:28.298
Oh, you wouldn't believe

19:28.366 --> 19:30.433
how many kids came dressed
as Mr. Whipple this year.

19:31.569 --> 19:32.803
I'm sorry.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.771
I know it's easy
to get behind
on your busing

19:34.839 --> 19:36.540
when you're the
only one here, but...

19:36.608 --> 19:37.908
Am I fired?

19:37.976 --> 19:39.944
I mean, I know I have
to clean up and all,

19:40.011 --> 19:41.345
but after that,
am I fired?

19:41.412 --> 19:43.113
Well, it is Halloween.

19:43.181 --> 19:45.182
People should have fun.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.851
And we <i>are</i> insured.

19:47.919 --> 19:48.886
Hey, what's that?

19:49.487 --> 19:50.921
I don't see any...

19:50.988 --> 19:52.622
(screaming)

19:52.690 --> 19:55.759
Wow, I guess this
<i>was</i> worth $14.95.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.227
Are you okay?

19:57.295 --> 20:00.330
Yeah, as soon as my heart starts
beating again, I'll be swell.

20:00.398 --> 20:03.967
Well, I heard you liked them,
so I brought you a Tootsie Pop.

20:05.437 --> 20:06.870
Thanks.

20:06.938 --> 20:08.905
So really, I'm not fired?

20:10.141 --> 20:12.509
"Though she screamed
as loud as she could,

20:12.577 --> 20:14.277
"not a sound could be heard

20:14.345 --> 20:17.581
"for the water slowly
but inexorably rose

20:17.649 --> 20:19.516
"over her face, and then...

20:19.584 --> 20:21.251
Poor Salem. He was
so determined
to read his stories

20:21.318 --> 20:23.419
whether anyone
listened or not.

20:23.487 --> 20:27.457
"...until, at last,
she was no more."

20:27.525 --> 20:28.959
The end.

20:30.995 --> 20:32.563
See?

20:32.630 --> 20:35.231
I told you they were scary.

20:35.299 --> 20:36.733
My first
mortal Halloween!

20:36.801 --> 20:38.135
I had such
a great time.

20:38.203 --> 20:39.168
Yeah, it was fun.

20:39.236 --> 20:41.104
Your boss, Josh,
he's great.

20:41.171 --> 20:42.873
Yeah, there's just one thing
that bothers me about him.

20:42.941 --> 20:43.674
What?

20:43.808 --> 20:46.143
I have a huge crush on him.

20:52.517 --> 20:56.754
So, what is it we learned
in this week's episode?

20:56.821 --> 20:58.421
That, try as you may,

20:58.489 --> 21:01.191
you cannot run away
from Halloween.

21:01.259 --> 21:04.928
That you never really know
what lurks beneath

21:04.996 --> 21:07.498
your neighborhood sewer grate.

21:07.565 --> 21:09.633
And that...

21:09.701 --> 21:11.935
those zombies were really scary.

21:12.671 --> 21:13.570
(yells)

21:14.538 --> 21:18.175
Oh, right. My coffee.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.876
Hey, where's my biscotti?

21:20.305 --> 21:26.679
