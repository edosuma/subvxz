WEBVTT

00:01.979 --> 00:03.460
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.562 --> 00:04.547
- Hello?
- Scarlett?

00:04.550 --> 00:06.916
Wanted to tell you how impressed
Rayna was with your performance.

00:06.925 --> 00:09.601
She'd like to sign you as
a solo artist to her label.

00:09.645 --> 00:11.062
You just got yourself a record deal.

00:11.097 --> 00:12.480
I wanted to ask you out on another date...

00:12.515 --> 00:14.664
dinner, a movie. Anything you want.

00:14.784 --> 00:16.484
I'm going back out on the road soon,

00:16.519 --> 00:19.771
and you might consider
coming with. Both of you.

00:19.822 --> 00:23.391
This is the first guitar
I ever tried to play.

00:23.409 --> 00:25.660
My mom gave it to me, and now it's yours.

00:25.694 --> 00:27.245
You're dead in this business!

00:27.279 --> 00:28.396
I don't know, man.

00:28.431 --> 00:30.565
I feel more alive than I have in months.

00:33.836 --> 00:36.454
I'm so excited that we're here in New York.

00:36.505 --> 00:38.790
Second leg of the tour with my girls.

00:38.841 --> 00:40.341
Yes! So cool.

00:40.376 --> 00:42.127
I just love that we're having
a little bit of girl time

00:42.178 --> 00:43.762
before spring break's over.

00:43.796 --> 00:45.096
- Yeah. We're gonna go shopping...
- Yes.

00:45.131 --> 00:46.881
We'll go sightseeing.

00:46.915 --> 00:48.967
- Hang out backstage at the Barclays Center?
- Yes.

00:49.018 --> 00:51.219
Talk to Juliette Barnes.

00:51.253 --> 00:52.253
Okay.

00:52.271 --> 00:53.471
And you know, we should go to the MET.

00:53.522 --> 00:55.390
That'd be great. Wouldn't it be fun?

00:55.424 --> 00:56.608
Not really, no.

00:56.642 --> 00:58.643
Oh, my gosh. Look, it's you.

00:58.694 --> 00:59.778
Wow.

00:59.812 --> 01:03.865
Oh, my gosh. Mom, you're huge!

01:03.899 --> 01:05.283
- Thanks, honey. Thank you.
- You're huge. 

01:05.316 --> 01:06.618
Gorgeous shot.

01:06.652 --> 01:08.486
Oh, that's from that
commercial campaign I did.

01:08.521 --> 01:10.288
They're sponsoring the tour.

01:10.322 --> 01:14.542
You are on a 50-foot
billboard in Times Square.

01:14.577 --> 01:16.878
That's a big deal.

01:16.912 --> 01:17.996
You know what's a big deal?

01:18.047 --> 01:19.247
Let's put it in perspective.

01:19.281 --> 01:21.049
The big deal is I got my
girls here in Times Square.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.550
- Yes, that's a big deal.
- That's a big deal.

01:22.585 --> 01:24.002
Perfect deal.

01:24.086 --> 01:26.287
So... what do you think of New York?

01:26.305 --> 01:27.622
I think it's nice.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.391
It's a lot cleaner than
I thought it would be.

01:30.426 --> 01:32.960
Maybe Emily can show you
around a little bit, huh?

01:32.978 --> 01:34.846
Or maybe you and I can
take in a Broadway show?

01:34.897 --> 01:37.732
There's no way. No
chance. I'm way too busy.

01:37.766 --> 01:38.867
She's got her new single launch tomorrow

01:38.901 --> 01:40.368
and a bunch of call-in interviews.

01:40.402 --> 01:42.787
Marshall and his lame
roll-out plan. I swear...

01:42.822 --> 01:43.888
Juliette.

01:43.923 --> 01:45.206
I know.

01:45.241 --> 01:47.976
Serenity to accept the
things that I cannot change.

01:48.010 --> 01:49.127
Got three sold-out shows in the city.

01:49.161 --> 01:50.311
Your mom's getting healthy.

01:50.346 --> 01:51.396
You got a lot to be thankful for.

01:51.430 --> 01:54.482
Yes. I'm zen. I am positive,

01:54.517 --> 01:55.867
I'm focused.

02:02.858 --> 02:04.893
What the hell is that?

02:09.580 --> 02:10.490
What's that?

02:10.548 --> 02:12.975
- A grapefruit.
- I have grapefruit?

02:12.979 --> 02:13.864
Yeah. You do now.

02:13.885 --> 02:16.103
In the last month, I've
seen you eat fruit twice.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.604
I don't want you getting
scurvy when you're on the road.

02:17.622 --> 02:19.423
- On the road. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

02:19.474 --> 02:20.657
Are you really that concerned,

02:20.692 --> 02:22.092
or are you just gonna
miss me a whole lot, huh?

02:23.756 --> 02:26.592
Well, we've hardly spent any
time apart since our first date.

02:26.626 --> 02:29.544
Maybe I'm just not ready to say good-bye.

02:29.579 --> 02:31.763
So don't.

02:31.798 --> 02:34.900
No. Come with me, you
know? Keep me well fed.

02:34.951 --> 02:37.769
Oh. You want me to go on the road with you?

02:39.555 --> 02:41.256
Yeah, I do.

02:41.291 --> 02:44.393
I mean, if you can get away
from the clinic and all.

02:45.578 --> 02:46.545
When were you thinking?

02:46.579 --> 02:48.230
- To get on the plane?
- Yeah.

02:48.264 --> 02:51.350
- Um, today, you know? Before it
takes off. - It's a little last-minute.

02:51.384 --> 02:52.768
Yeah, you could see it like that,

02:52.802 --> 02:54.286
or you could just think
of it as, uh, I don't know,

02:54.320 --> 02:57.656
very romantic, you know? Spontaneous.

02:58.485 --> 03:01.053
Well, I already know that about you.

03:01.105 --> 03:02.105
Yeah?

03:05.726 --> 03:07.076
Am I gonna be in your way?

03:07.515 --> 03:08.678
You sure?

03:08.712 --> 03:10.379
Yeah.

03:10.693 --> 03:11.644
Besides, you know what?

03:11.682 --> 03:13.816
I think you could help me
out here with, uh, Sue...

03:14.459 --> 03:17.606
uh, who I think is gonna have
a lot of separation anxiety.

03:17.888 --> 03:21.235
- So, uh, I'll be all right myself, but, uh...
- Yeah.

03:22.092 --> 03:25.545
I don't think you have any idea
how much that dog'd miss you.

03:31.251 --> 03:32.578
I got you a present.

03:32.584 --> 03:34.142
What did you do?

03:35.018 --> 03:36.206
Oh, no. 

03:36.269 --> 03:37.445
What?

03:37.565 --> 03:38.665
I know how much you love cleaning...

03:38.703 --> 03:40.924
so I thought, you know,
give your hands a treat.

03:41.044 --> 03:43.552
They're awful. Thank you. 

03:43.539 --> 03:44.903
Well, I'm glad you love 'em. 

03:48.569 --> 03:50.572
Um, I just... I heard
some people down here,

03:50.578 --> 03:52.049
and I thought I'd come introduce myself.

03:52.169 --> 03:53.875
Hi. I'm Will. I just moved in upstairs.

03:53.926 --> 03:55.834
Gunnar. Nice to meet you.
This is my girlfriend Scarlett.

03:55.890 --> 03:57.792
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.143
You a cowboy, musician, or both?

03:59.187 --> 04:01.508
Uh, here, musician.

04:01.628 --> 04:03.771
Back in Abilene, I might
have worked a ranch or two.

04:03.986 --> 04:06.901
I'm guessing from the songs I
hear filter up through the floor

04:06.925 --> 04:08.266
y'all musicians, too?

04:08.266 --> 04:09.173
Yeah, you got that right.

04:09.442 --> 04:12.162
Cool. Cool. Maybe you give
the new guy some pointers?

04:12.401 --> 04:13.596
Where to play around town?

04:13.615 --> 04:15.385
Why don't you just come
around for supper tonight?

04:15.429 --> 04:17.613
Can have a little welcome to
Nashville thing, you reckon?

04:18.113 --> 04:19.659
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

04:19.696 --> 04:20.391
7:00 all right?

04:20.452 --> 04:22.587
See you then.

04:22.643 --> 04:24.013
Oh, almost forgot...

04:24.038 --> 04:26.728
um, I got some of y'all's mail by mistake.

04:26.779 --> 04:29.180
Ah, thank you.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.915
Looks like you got something
important from Edgehill Records.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:46.692 --> 04:47.956
Hey, Hailey.

04:47.956 --> 04:49.315
Was hoping to catch you.

04:49.866 --> 04:50.923
Hi.

04:51.192 --> 04:52.381
Sorry for not getting back to you.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.484
- Work's busy.
- Yeah. No problem.

04:54.517 --> 04:56.651
Just wanted to get you
some of my new material.

04:56.669 --> 04:58.963
I still owe songs against
my publishing deal, right?

04:59.021 --> 05:02.667
I got one on here would
be perfect for Eric church.

05:03.860 --> 05:06.865
Avery, your value to us as a songwriter

05:06.878 --> 05:09.218
was in you being a performer
attached to a label.

05:09.236 --> 05:10.438
I know. I know,

05:10.558 --> 05:12.321
but there's more to me
than just being a performer.

05:12.359 --> 05:13.473
Burning your masters?

05:13.616 --> 05:14.899
When Jeannie found out about what you did,

05:14.881 --> 05:16.151
I almost got fired.

05:16.186 --> 05:19.648
And I'm truly sorry that
I put you in that position,

05:19.666 --> 05:21.468
but I... I did what I had to do.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.958
You're in breach of contract
with South Circle Publishing.

05:25.260 --> 05:27.894
Look, you're crazy talented,
and I believed in you.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.046
But you gotta find a new record deal

05:30.446 --> 05:31.554
or pay back the advance.

05:31.585 --> 05:34.138
I can't do that. I mean, I got nothing.

05:34.194 --> 05:36.227
Well, she's not gonna
write you off as a loss,

05:36.752 --> 05:38.629
so you gotta do something.

05:46.094 --> 05:47.339
I am powerful.

05:47.983 --> 05:49.510
I am confident.

05:50.029 --> 05:52.075
- I am centered.
- Good, Jolene.

05:52.838 --> 05:54.047
Juliette.

05:54.082 --> 05:55.478
I'm zen.

05:56.242 --> 05:58.306
I am positive.

05:59.103 --> 06:00.815
I'm really pissed off!

06:00.855 --> 06:02.186
You gotta stop doing that.

06:02.207 --> 06:04.245
I... how can I when I know Rayna's big face

06:04.251 --> 06:05.208
is staring at me?

06:05.208 --> 06:06.679
It should be my face up there.

06:06.799 --> 06:08.705
My single's coming out, not hers.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.064
This is therapy. Can
we please focus inward?

06:11.133 --> 06:13.767
An ad campaign plastering
my face all over the world...

06:13.780 --> 06:16.195
that could make the difference
between my album skyrocketing

06:16.315 --> 06:18.491
- or crashing.
- Honey, you sell millions of records.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.580
You're not gonna crash.

06:19.567 --> 06:21.082
If I wanna stay in this position,

06:21.094 --> 06:23.034
then I need to keep selling albums.

06:23.059 --> 06:26.181
If I just had a big name sponsor behind me,

06:26.206 --> 06:28.152
it would help turn this record platinum.

06:28.890 --> 06:30.592
Come on. You're a businessman.

06:30.780 --> 06:32.500
Or you were before you
blew it all on cocaine,

06:32.481 --> 06:34.071
but you understand what I'm talking about.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.973
You're supposed to accept
the things you can't change.

06:36.973 --> 06:38.531
This one...

06:39.220 --> 06:40.740
you absolutely can.

06:41.423 --> 06:44.387
Now that is the kind of
attitude I need around here.

06:44.744 --> 06:46.959
You get an offer a month ago
and you didn't tell me about it?

06:46.978 --> 06:48.179
You didn't even say you auditioned?

06:48.235 --> 06:49.280
I did not audition. 

06:49.312 --> 06:51.289
I only sang to cover for the
fact that you weren't there.

06:55.042 --> 06:56.985
The reason I have not said anything to you

06:57.032 --> 06:58.414
is because I've been
trying to convince them

06:58.421 --> 07:00.442
that we are better together
than I am as a solo act.

07:00.476 --> 07:02.443
Everybody in this town is
trying to get a contract,

07:02.456 --> 07:03.313
myself included.

07:03.307 --> 07:05.252
And you're... you're looking
for reasons not to sign one?

07:05.264 --> 07:06.485
I'm looking for ways to include you,

07:06.516 --> 07:07.523
- which is the way it should be.
- Oh, yeah.

07:07.548 --> 07:09.300
'Cause not talking to me
for a month about it...

07:09.319 --> 07:11.896
that's really inclusive, Scarlett. 

07:17.002 --> 07:18.457
We love your music.

07:18.485 --> 07:20.781
All right. It's great
to meet y'all. Thank you.

07:20.901 --> 07:23.227
Okay. Let's go get some dinner.

07:23.347 --> 07:25.154
Can't we just eat catering backstage?

07:25.436 --> 07:28.038
No, we're gonna go eat
some good Chinese food

07:28.082 --> 07:28.782
in New York City.

07:28.776 --> 07:29.890
Oh, she just wants to be back

07:29.909 --> 07:31.498
before Juliette Barnes' sound check.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.332
And mom's. It's good experience
for when I start touring.

07:34.452 --> 07:35.540
Say what?

07:35.759 --> 07:36.835
I wanna sing.

07:37.218 --> 07:38.588
Professionally.

07:40.265 --> 07:41.297
Since when?

07:41.316 --> 07:43.392
Since, like... now.

07:43.417 --> 07:44.925
She wants to be a celebrity.

07:45.045 --> 07:46.495
Well, I didn't say that.

07:48.911 --> 07:50.838
Let's go. Come on, Sue.

07:51.257 --> 07:52.158
Deacon!

07:52.158 --> 07:53.572
Hey. Look who's here.

07:53.585 --> 07:55.506
- I didn't know Deacon had a dog.
- Oh, that's sue.

07:55.518 --> 07:56.701
Uh, me, neither.

07:56.821 --> 07:58.434
Is that the niece you
were telling me about?

07:58.447 --> 07:59.610
Nope.

07:59.798 --> 08:00.906
Hi! Hey, how y'all doing?

08:00.906 --> 08:03.214
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is Sue.

08:03.221 --> 08:03.922
Hi. I'm Rayna.

08:03.953 --> 08:05.774
- Oh, I'm sorry. This is Stacey.
- Stacey.

08:05.811 --> 08:07.676
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Tandy.

08:07.676 --> 08:08.170
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:08.170 --> 08:11.255
- Y'all working together?
- No, no. She's, um, uh...

08:11.499 --> 08:13.913
- I'm his girlfriend.
- Girlfriend. She's my girlfriend.

08:13.944 --> 08:15.308
Wow.

08:15.483 --> 08:17.404
- That's nice.
- Yep.

08:19.181 --> 08:21.415
Well, we are gonna go
get some Chinese food.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.854
Y'all take care. See you.

08:22.879 --> 08:24.522
- It's adorable, that doggy.
- Bye.

08:24.543 --> 08:25.990
You, too. Nice to meet you.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.060
- Girlfriend?
- Yep.

08:30.975 --> 08:32.283
Hello?

08:33.020 --> 08:34.703
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:35.366 --> 08:36.780
Let me get that for you.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.878
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:41.149 --> 08:43.770
Now remember, nobody can
know you were here, okay?

08:43.758 --> 08:44.847
Oh, come on, Teddy.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.043
You know I'm a master at keeping secrets.

09:15.466 --> 09:17.262
So you're saying I can't
pursue a career in music?

09:17.325 --> 09:20.133
I... I just don't want
you to do it now, honey.

09:20.358 --> 09:22.579
Right now you should be doing
a lot of different things,

09:22.604 --> 09:24.031
figuring out what makes you happy.

09:24.074 --> 09:25.819
But I already know that
singing makes me happy.

09:25.888 --> 09:27.628
Great. So keep on singing.

09:27.684 --> 09:29.060
But not professionally.

09:29.029 --> 09:30.668
Honey, as soon as you go professional,

09:30.687 --> 09:32.895
people are gonna start trying
to turn you into something.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.541
I don't want you turning into anything.

09:34.791 --> 09:38.400
Now is a time for you to
study and enjoy your childhood.

09:38.425 --> 09:40.339
- But I'm not a child.
- She's a tween.

09:40.358 --> 09:41.747
I'm 13, stupid.

09:41.784 --> 09:44.550
Hey, hey, hey. 

09:44.581 --> 09:46.645
If you don't want me to
become, like, a famous musician,

09:46.658 --> 09:47.765
then why'd you give me this guitar?

09:47.765 --> 09:50.080
That is a very special guitar.
You take good care of it.

09:50.117 --> 09:52.432
I gave you that guitar so
you could write songs on it

09:52.445 --> 09:53.489
and work out your feelings.

09:53.508 --> 09:55.404
Well, you didn't get me anything
and I have feelings, too.

09:55.416 --> 09:57.268
Seriously? Now come on, y'all...

09:57.268 --> 09:57.868
We both wanna be performers, mom.

09:57.893 --> 09:59.339
You can even sign us to your new label.

09:59.357 --> 10:01.472
Nobody is getting signed to anything.

10:01.491 --> 10:03.712
Okay. Big show tonight.

10:03.731 --> 10:07.240
Why don't we let mom have
a little bit of space?

10:07.297 --> 10:08.504
Can we go to craft services?

10:08.485 --> 10:11.157
Yes. Great idea. Go to craft services.

10:13.736 --> 10:15.999
You do realize that they
just wanna be like you?

10:16.119 --> 10:18.283
They can be like anything they want.

10:18.302 --> 10:20.123
I just want 'em to grow up first.

10:20.405 --> 10:23.352
That is the V.I.P. room for afterwards.

10:23.633 --> 10:25.222
- Here's the massage room.
- Wow.

10:25.235 --> 10:26.467
- Yes, we have a massage room.
- Mm.

10:26.486 --> 10:27.406
Gets very stressful.

10:27.443 --> 10:29.333
Yeah, I'm sure it does. 

10:29.652 --> 10:31.322
- That's the, uh, crew right there.
- Okay.

10:31.341 --> 10:33.318
That's Dave. He's stage
manager. Mitch is on drums.

10:33.375 --> 10:35.157
Uh, Paul right there is front of house.

10:35.182 --> 10:36.165
What's...

10:36.215 --> 10:37.585
- Yeah, uh, sound.
- Oh.

10:37.591 --> 10:39.994
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

10:40.282 --> 10:41.389
I have no idea who that guy is.

10:41.427 --> 10:42.334
Hey.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.029
- Hey.
- Who's the new guy?

10:44.149 --> 10:45.900
Uh, that's my mama's sober companion.

10:45.944 --> 10:48.070
- And you must be Stacey.
- I am.

10:48.070 --> 10:50.973
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

10:50.973 --> 10:53.112
Yeah, you, too, and all
good things, of course.

10:53.156 --> 10:54.664
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:54.726 --> 10:56.935
Well, then he must not
have told you everything.

10:57.055 --> 10:58.449
Enjoy the show.

11:01.446 --> 11:04.175
Wow. She is a real firecracker.

11:06.584 --> 11:08.830
I'd love to get back in
here on a weekend night.

11:09.699 --> 11:11.457
We're booked solid on Saturdays

11:11.489 --> 11:13.034
through the next few months, at least.

11:13.065 --> 11:14.191
Any night then.

11:14.410 --> 11:15.962
Or any last-minute cancellations.

11:15.981 --> 11:17.583
I just wanna play, you know?

11:17.703 --> 11:19.980
Truth be told, I could use the money.

11:20.444 --> 11:21.857
- It's gonna be tough.
- Why?

11:21.881 --> 11:23.288
I mean, I packed this place out.

11:23.297 --> 11:24.727
My music's always killed here.

11:24.790 --> 11:27.484
It ain't about the
music. It's about Marilyn.

11:27.535 --> 11:28.819
She put the word out,

11:28.837 --> 11:31.703
and... if we wanna be
in business with her... 

11:31.697 --> 11:33.273
You can't be in business with me.

11:34.137 --> 11:35.582
It'll blow over.

11:35.801 --> 11:37.096
Just give it some time.

11:37.344 --> 11:38.828
Yeah, well...

11:39.154 --> 11:40.718
I'm running out of that.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.898
So how long you two been together?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.486
Personally or professionally?

11:47.013 --> 11:48.145
A few months.

11:49.097 --> 11:50.436
Cut any demos yet?

11:50.673 --> 11:52.400
Um, actually, we... we
got a publishing deal

11:52.425 --> 11:54.277
on our first one. It was really lucky.

11:54.346 --> 11:55.822
She was real lucky.

11:56.354 --> 11:57.837
Don't sell yourself short, Scarlett.

11:57.957 --> 12:00.239
She's just got a recording
contract with Rayna Jaymes.

12:00.359 --> 12:01.084
Whoa.

12:01.779 --> 12:03.243
That's pretty damn quick.

12:03.243 --> 12:05.281
I-I hope some of your luck rubs off on me.

12:05.401 --> 12:07.991
Well, thank you. It's,
uh, it's not settled yet.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.069
I have to finish making dinner.

12:11.374 --> 12:13.453
Uh, maybe you can tell
him about the best clubs

12:13.478 --> 12:14.393
to play around here.

I would love for you
to set up some meetings

13:58.457 --> 14:00.105

while I'm here in New York.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.275
Why?

14:01.395 --> 14:03.940
You've turned down every company
I've sent your way before.

14:04.329 --> 14:06.355
Because I'm not a 15-year-old girl

14:06.355 --> 14:08.220
peddling cheap perfume anymore.

14:08.458 --> 14:09.696
I'm an adult,

14:09.816 --> 14:12.637
and I think it would be good for
any company to have me on board

14:12.681 --> 14:14.414
who's trying to reach
a 20-something audience,

14:14.414 --> 14:16.185
wouldn't you think?

14:17.217 --> 14:19.826
I can arrange a meeting with
Keoh Electronics tomorrow.

14:20.201 --> 14:22.090
They expressed some interest a while back.

14:22.147 --> 14:23.573
Smartphones make you happy?

14:23.693 --> 14:25.594
Who tweets more than my fans?

14:25.832 --> 14:28.528
And you won't have to pitch
me. I-I'll pitch myself,

14:28.535 --> 14:31.619
and they will see how much I've grown.

14:36.813 --> 14:38.683
- Thanks, Danny.
- Hi!

14:38.715 --> 14:40.297
You were so great.

14:40.417 --> 14:43.100
It's so fun to look out
and see you out there.

14:43.863 --> 14:45.171
Mama did good, huh?

14:45.196 --> 14:46.303
- I know.
- Yeah.

14:46.328 --> 14:47.617
I like your new girlfriend.

14:47.642 --> 14:48.718
Oh, thank you.

14:48.937 --> 14:50.583
She seems nice.

14:50.626 --> 14:51.652
Yeah, she is.

14:51.772 --> 14:53.961
Pretty serious, huh? Dog and all?

14:54.774 --> 14:56.426
Might be. Yeah.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.669
You gonna stay up all
night and rock out with us?

15:19.731 --> 15:21.120
I hope so. 

15:21.170 --> 15:23.122
I think y'all need some Shirley Temples.

I pre-ordered your single.

So it downloads tomorrow at midnight.

15:34.796 --> 15:36.479
When she was 12. Duh.

15:36.842 --> 15:38.181
Your mom never stopped you.

15:38.231 --> 15:39.939
Well, nobody could.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.741
You gotta go after what you want.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.480
And don't take "no" for an answer.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.638

- Hey.
- Hey.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.376
I'll see y'all.

15:57.409 --> 15:59.925
Uh, your girls are great.

15:59.959 --> 16:00.910
Thanks.

16:00.944 --> 16:02.801
I bet they can sing real well.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.109
When you getting 'em started?

16:04.153 --> 16:05.880
Oh, I'm... I'm trying to keep 'em

16:05.880 --> 16:07.719
as far away from this business as I can.

16:08.977 --> 16:12.017
They're really lucky to have
a mama watching out for 'em.

16:12.631 --> 16:13.957
More than I had.

16:14.376 --> 16:15.633
Thank you.

16:16.348 --> 16:17.998
You got your mama here now, right?

16:18.118 --> 16:19.484
Yeah.

16:27.058 --> 16:28.410
- Mom!
- My people.

16:28.444 --> 16:29.223
Great show.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.913
- Oh, I'm sorry that took so long.
- It's okay.

16:31.981 --> 16:34.959
So are y'all ready to go up
and have a little slumber party,

16:34.984 --> 16:36.198
get ready for our big day tomorrow?

Uh, mom, we're gonna stay up late

16:37.743 --> 16:39.395
and party like rock stars with Juliette.

16:39.445 --> 16:40.659
Nope. You're not.

16:40.684 --> 16:42.229
Mom, guess what? She
started when she was 12.

16:42.210 --> 16:42.986
I know.

16:43.030 --> 16:44.438
I wanna stay up late with her.

16:44.475 --> 16:45.833
Actually, your mom has a great idea.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.541
Let's go up, get a little room service.

16:47.554 --> 16:48.956
- Can I press the button?
- Go press that button.

16:49.000 --> 16:49.719
- Yes!

- Have fun.
- Thank you.

18:26.760 --> 18:27.430
Bye.

18:27.550 --> 18:29.479
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.211
- Good show.
- Thanks.

18:33.735 --> 18:34.250
Hey.

18:34.551 --> 18:35.883
Can I get you something?

18:35.903 --> 18:37.316
No, I'm okay.

18:38.339 --> 18:39.693
How's it going?

18:40.691 --> 18:42.309
It's going.

18:44.091 --> 18:45.011
You okay?

18:45.062 --> 18:46.947
I...

18:46.981 --> 18:48.978
I'm just a little surprised, you know,

18:48.996 --> 18:50.041
that you would invite me out here

18:50.078 --> 18:52.806
when you've clearly had history
with both of the headliners.

18:53.094 --> 18:54.934
I mean, are you trying to scare me away?

18:55.054 --> 18:57.505
No. Hell, no.

18:58.294 --> 19:00.584
Just... we've been having a lot of fun.

19:00.609 --> 19:01.798
I just didn't want it to end at all.

19:01.804 --> 19:03.756
- Is that what we're doing?
- Not what I meant.

19:03.762 --> 19:05.620
You know what? I... 

19:05.740 --> 19:07.253
Didn't expect to come here

19:07.240 --> 19:09.718
and fit in and feel comfortable, or...

19:10.293 --> 19:12.176
but I did expect for
you to be honest with me

19:12.195 --> 19:14.166
about the most important
relationships in your life,

19:14.178 --> 19:16.005
and not have to hear it from some weird,

19:16.030 --> 19:17.807
kabuki kind of conversation

19:17.832 --> 19:19.428
with a woman you've sung love songs with

19:19.422 --> 19:21.180
- for the last decade.
- Okay, Stacey...

19:21.205 --> 19:22.582
- It's a little...
- Stacey.

19:22.625 --> 19:23.946
- Uh-huh?
- You're right.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.518
You're right. I'm sorry, all right?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.664
I should have explained it all

19:28.701 --> 19:32.511
and told you that, yeah, I
have a history with Rayna,

19:32.911 --> 19:35.007
and it's long and it's complicated.

19:35.501 --> 19:36.821
But...

19:37.960 --> 19:39.155
It is history.

19:39.424 --> 19:40.524
Is it?

19:40.806 --> 19:42.677
'Cause you know, it doesn't
really seem like that.

19:42.797 --> 19:45.398
I don't know what to tell you. It is.

19:48.551 --> 19:49.847
What's bothering you?

19:50.159 --> 19:52.218
Maddie is really struggling.

19:54.251 --> 19:56.084
You know, this divorce, man.

19:56.084 --> 19:58.687
You know, and she's the
same age I was when mom died.

19:58.693 --> 20:00.739
- Yeah.
- I know exactly how she feels.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.503
All I wanna do is just protect her.

20:02.873 --> 20:05.463
And it doesn't feel like having her here,

20:05.494 --> 20:08.335
hanging out with Juliette
Barnes is doing that.

20:08.353 --> 20:09.974
This isn't about Juliette.

20:10.762 --> 20:11.807
They idolize you.

20:11.927 --> 20:13.772
They are not idolizing me right now,

20:13.816 --> 20:15.855
- I'll tell you that much.
- Of course they are.

20:15.886 --> 20:16.731
No.

20:17.427 --> 20:18.344
We all do.

20:18.378 --> 20:19.778
And so for the girls,

20:19.816 --> 20:21.661
if they want to fantasize a little bit

20:21.664 --> 20:24.220
about what it would be
like to be a big star,

20:24.340 --> 20:26.109
if it helps them through this hard time,

20:26.428 --> 20:28.087
what's the harm?

20:28.305 --> 20:30.338
The harm is that I...

20:30.590 --> 20:33.609
have two really, really talented daughters.

20:39.222 --> 20:41.444
And I don't wanna see 'em
messed up by this business.

20:41.494 --> 20:42.939
But they don't understand that.

20:43.352 --> 20:46.249
At their age, all they can
hear you saying is "no."

20:46.837 --> 20:48.927
And from their point of view,

20:48.996 --> 20:51.711
well, it sounds the way
that it sounded to you

20:51.723 --> 20:54.489
when you felt like daddy
didn't support your dreams.

20:54.609 --> 20:55.653
What?

20:58.186 --> 20:59.388
Don't compare me to daddy.

20:59.388 --> 21:00.758
I'm just sayin'...

21:04.049 --> 21:06.845
You should start thinking about
that Keoh Electronics meeting.

21:07.427 --> 21:10.130
I have, and I want you to come with me.

21:10.418 --> 21:13.083
No. No, that's... that's
not what I'm here for.

21:13.565 --> 21:16.092
Come on. You come alive when you strategize

21:16.124 --> 21:17.463
and talk business.

21:17.650 --> 21:19.821
Why deny yourself something
that gives you that rush?

21:19.827 --> 21:21.666
I'm supposed to deny myself the things

21:21.666 --> 21:23.086
that give me that rush. I'm an addict.

21:23.206 --> 21:24.888
Okay, we're not talking about cocaine.

21:24.882 --> 21:26.884
We're talking about a
corporate meeting here.

21:27.335 --> 21:29.718
Please? I'll be better if you're there.

21:30.368 --> 21:32.202
Please? For me? Please?

21:32.836 --> 21:34.353
For you.

21:34.648 --> 21:36.894
Hey. Good night. I know I
haven't seen much of you today,

21:36.912 --> 21:38.420
but the show was really amazing.

21:38.627 --> 21:40.166
Good night, mama.

21:40.286 --> 21:42.049
- So we have to be there at 4:00.
- Okay.

21:42.055 --> 21:44.570
- Um, what... about our therapy?
- Oh...

21:44.614 --> 21:47.164
Uh, you can go to my crew A.A. meeting.

21:47.284 --> 21:48.417
It's good.

21:48.962 --> 21:50.063
Okay. Uh...

21:50.088 --> 21:52.297
Yeah. You... you should
definitely go to that.

21:52.516 --> 21:54.129
All right. I can do that.

21:54.692 --> 21:55.850
'Night.

21:56.989 --> 21:59.416
So I'm thinking when I
walk into the meeting,

21:59.422 --> 22:01.011
- I should sit down...
- No.

22:01.131 --> 22:02.775
You should probably stand.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.214
- I should stand.
- Yeah.

22:04.684 --> 22:06.248
And I'm gonna tell them my stats,

22:06.241 --> 22:08.387
but I'm not gonna be forward about it,

22:08.381 --> 22:10.221
- I'm gonna tell 'em...
- Look, just... just be honest.

22:10.341 --> 22:11.721
I have faith in you.

22:13.386 --> 22:16.138
- Thanks for coming, Deputy Mayor.
- Thank you.

22:19.122 --> 22:21.399
Coleman. 

22:21.850 --> 22:24.491
We celebrated you passing
the bar at this very table.

22:24.459 --> 22:26.424
We did, and that's ancient history.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.407
Look, that stadium...

22:30.458 --> 22:32.008
it's a done deal tomorrow.

22:32.043 --> 22:33.193
Is that what Teddy said?

22:33.227 --> 22:35.145
I know nothing's closed yet.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.747
I'm sure he...

22:36.781 --> 22:38.749
tells you whatever he
thinks you need to hear.

22:38.730 --> 22:41.376
Why don't you just, um... sell the land?

22:41.496 --> 22:42.972
Donate a couple million to charity?

22:43.034 --> 22:44.899
You think I spent all that
time and money on Teddy

22:44.906 --> 22:46.419
so he could put me in this position?

22:46.457 --> 22:47.524
No, no, no.

22:47.558 --> 22:49.309
He's gonna make good on his deal

22:49.353 --> 22:50.544
to build where I say...

22:51.030 --> 22:52.562
or he's gonna wish he had.

22:52.845 --> 22:55.773
Look, Lamar, why don't
you just let this thing go?

22:56.617 --> 22:57.784
Now, uh...

22:58.476 --> 23:00.587
if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.549
You'll see things differently

23:03.587 --> 23:05.777
after Teddy disappoints you

23:06.459 --> 23:07.767
the way he's disappointed me.

23:07.798 --> 23:09.650
And when you do, you come see me,

23:09.957 --> 23:13.511
like in the old days
when you had real power.

23:18.929 --> 23:20.681
Any possibilities there?

23:21.939 --> 23:23.321
Nah.

23:24.434 --> 23:25.829
We'll have to find something else.

23:25.867 --> 23:27.712
Maybe something...

23:27.938 --> 23:29.439
pPersonal.

23:29.508 --> 23:32.949
I just got some information
from a tabloid source.

23:33.188 --> 23:35.439
Not sure how useful it'll be.

23:36.974 --> 23:38.580
We have confirmation

23:38.605 --> 23:41.577
on who leaked Teddy's
divorce to the tabloids.

23:49.366 --> 23:51.168
So you a Texans or Cowboys fan?

23:51.212 --> 23:53.120
Neither. Longhorns.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.906
Hey, what's up with the
Titans? You follow them?

23:56.951 --> 23:58.390
Well, man, they're worth watching.

23:58.421 --> 23:59.929
People go crazy on game day.

23:59.985 --> 24:02.577
But they draft from Texas
Tech, Baylor, Aggies.

24:02.563 --> 24:03.663
Dudes you'd recognize.

24:03.695 --> 24:04.796
How are the cheerleaders?

24:04.799 --> 24:06.467
Hope you don't think me rude,

24:06.500 --> 24:08.056
but I'm gonna call it a night.

24:08.262 --> 24:12.392
Oh. Well... thank you very
much for a lovely dinner,

24:12.461 --> 24:13.925
and I hope we do it again soon.

24:13.950 --> 24:15.245
You're very welcome.

24:19.305 --> 24:20.882
You read my mind.

24:21.002 --> 24:22.427
Thank you. 

24:25.017 --> 24:26.969
Hope you don't mind my asking, but, um...

24:28.489 --> 24:29.866
you and Scarlett live together,

24:30.041 --> 24:31.993
you write together, perform together.

24:32.769 --> 24:35.234
How come she's getting a
contract from Rayna Jaymes,

24:35.222 --> 24:36.205
and you're not?

24:39.926 --> 24:41.327
Sorry. It's none of my business.

24:41.361 --> 24:43.855
Just seemed like it was causin'
some problems for you, is all.

24:48.415 --> 24:52.276
My brother died two
days before the audition.

24:53.515 --> 24:55.817
She wanted to reschedule.
I wouldn't let her.

24:56.011 --> 24:57.857
Then I got drunk and never showed up.

24:58.213 --> 25:00.084
She was right, and I was wrong.

25:02.143 --> 25:03.594
Tomorrow's another day.

25:11.915 --> 25:13.792
Good afternoon, everybody.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.713
How are you?

25:15.933 --> 25:18.291
Thank you all so much for
taking the time to meet with me.

25:18.316 --> 25:20.850
I know you're very
busy, so I appreciate it.

25:21.219 --> 25:23.822
The new album... it's going places.

25:23.942 --> 25:25.762
But that's not why we're here.

25:26.648 --> 25:27.776
And let me guess...

25:27.896 --> 25:29.754
it's not about whether
or not you like my music,

25:29.810 --> 25:32.532
or whether you think my fan
base is gonna buy your product,

25:32.563 --> 25:33.852
because that's a given.

25:34.171 --> 25:36.588
I've got 15 million Twitter followers,

25:36.586 --> 25:38.357
30 million Facebook fans,

25:38.288 --> 25:39.527
and more Tumblr pages

25:39.521 --> 25:41.692
than any country music star on the planet.

25:41.898 --> 25:45.364
But you're worried that
I'm a bit of a loose cannon.

25:47.479 --> 25:50.951
And I'm not gonna deny that
I've had my share of issues.

25:51.377 --> 25:53.185
But I think all of us can admit

25:53.179 --> 25:55.312
that we've had some
heartbreak in our lives.

25:55.863 --> 25:59.028
Mine just happens to be in the public eye.

25:59.285 --> 26:02.032
But I'm taking responsibility
for my mistakes,

26:02.063 --> 26:03.784
and I'm moving forward.

26:04.334 --> 26:06.705
My best days are not behind me.

26:07.256 --> 26:08.864
They're in front of me.

26:15.121 --> 26:16.072
Thank you.

26:16.385 --> 26:18.400
I take requests, folks!

26:19.207 --> 26:21.109
A dollar? 50 cents?

26:21.165 --> 26:24.068
Hell, I'll even take a quarter
if I like the song enough.

26:24.131 --> 26:26.512
Well, how 'bout, uh, "Kiss,"

26:26.546 --> 26:28.680
or "Twist of Barbed Wire"?

26:28.698 --> 26:30.249
You see, I heard you were out here busking,

26:30.262 --> 26:32.721
and I just had to come
see it with my own eyes.

26:32.714 --> 26:35.786
Yeah. Some kind of poetic justice, right?

26:35.906 --> 26:36.920
Hey, it's all right.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.990
You wanna come down
here and gloat? I get it.

26:38.940 --> 26:40.679
No, I'm not in a position to, brother.

26:41.661 --> 26:43.494
I'm going up to Ohio to work for my dad.

26:43.530 --> 26:44.864
What are you talking about, J.T.?

26:44.921 --> 26:46.422
You're a killer bass
player. You can't do that.

26:46.450 --> 26:47.516
Yeah, well, it's like you said,

26:47.529 --> 26:49.385
not everybody can make it here, right?

26:49.887 --> 26:51.495
Maybe you should go home, too.

26:51.615 --> 26:53.410
Get a job working with dear old dad.

26:54.730 --> 26:56.112
I don't know. That's the same guy

26:56.112 --> 26:58.014
who said I was throwing my life away

26:58.134 --> 26:59.612
and I was a waste.

26:59.997 --> 27:01.430
I'm not going back home.

27:01.949 --> 27:02.794
Never.

27:02.794 --> 27:04.595
Then you're just a bullheaded as he is.

27:04.789 --> 27:06.060
Scarlett's moved on.

27:06.629 --> 27:08.418
You can't get gigs here, man.

27:08.681 --> 27:11.021
There is nothing for
you in Nashville anymore.

27:11.221 --> 27:13.171
Music's all I know how to do.

27:16.282 --> 27:17.734
Hey, I don't want your money.

27:17.772 --> 27:19.029
I'm not giving it.

27:19.430 --> 27:20.668
It's for a roadie gig.

27:20.850 --> 27:24.191
Call this guy. He's a good man, all right?

27:24.379 --> 27:25.749
You won't be making any music,

27:25.755 --> 27:27.626
but it sure as hell beats
playing in the street.

27:28.022 --> 27:29.459
Wow.

27:29.904 --> 27:31.749
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

27:32.494 --> 27:33.902
I did it. 

27:33.895 --> 27:37.267
You're looking at the new
Keoh Electronic poster girl.

27:37.265 --> 27:39.789
4,500 billboards nationwide,

27:39.784 --> 27:41.822
and they're gonna
cross-promote the new album.

27:43.023 --> 27:44.906
Heaven sakes,

27:44.919 --> 27:47.622
I am sorry that I stole Dante. I am.

27:47.821 --> 27:49.473
But, mama, I just won

27:49.494 --> 27:51.250
a multi-million dollar endorsement deal.

27:51.257 --> 27:53.380
Can you at least pretend
to be happy for me?

27:53.414 --> 27:55.380
You think that money's all
that matters, don't you?

27:56.068 --> 28:00.047
Uh, no. I think that your
hotel room costs $1,500 a night.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.349
And you haven't complained

28:01.374 --> 28:05.066
- about massages and room service...
- You know, I am not here for that.

28:05.097 --> 28:07.455
You're here because you
have nowhere else to go.

28:07.637 --> 28:09.376
You know what? You're right.

28:10.196 --> 28:11.435
You're all I got.

28:12.135 --> 28:14.894
There's nowhere else I would rather be.

28:16.484 --> 28:18.160
And if you would just figure out

28:18.204 --> 28:19.743
how to feel more for me

28:19.768 --> 28:21.601
than you do for some cell phone deal,

28:21.645 --> 28:23.472
then maybe we...

28:32.425 --> 28:34.321
Please tell my sponsor

28:34.314 --> 28:37.173
that I have gone to the A.A. tour meeting

28:37.205 --> 28:40.171
in case he wants to talk
to me about it at all.

28:55.728 --> 28:56.645
Hey.

28:58.665 --> 29:00.182
Gunnar?

29:01.534 --> 29:02.763
Hello?

29:04.215 --> 29:05.420
You awake?

29:07.212 --> 29:08.569
What time is it?

29:08.869 --> 29:10.208
I gotta go to work in a minute,

29:10.183 --> 29:11.735
but I...

29:12.154 --> 29:14.000
been waiting all day for you to wake up.

29:16.315 --> 29:17.723
I'm not signing this.

29:18.592 --> 29:19.455
What?

29:23.753 --> 29:26.050
Before I met you, I just wrote poems.

29:27.395 --> 29:29.903
And everything since that night

29:29.916 --> 29:30.910
has been 'cause of you.

29:31.718 --> 29:34.621
And you've worked so long and so hard

29:34.652 --> 29:35.778
to get one of those.

29:36.022 --> 29:37.705
I wouldn't be here without you.

29:39.138 --> 29:41.091
And I won't do it without you.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.930
Okay. Is talent ready for sound check?

29:53.917 --> 29:55.638
Oh, yes. Thanks, Buck.

29:56.639 --> 29:57.597
So here's the thing...

29:57.628 --> 30:01.512
your talent is a gift. Both of you.

30:01.632 --> 30:04.098
And me wanting you to take
the time to develop that

30:04.116 --> 30:06.100
isn't me trying to hold you back.

30:06.156 --> 30:07.513
Even though I know it might feel that way.

30:07.551 --> 30:09.787
It's just that I love you so much,

30:09.797 --> 30:11.336
and I want you to have every advantage

30:11.342 --> 30:13.363
that time and experience can give you.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.264
You know what I mean?

30:14.251 --> 30:16.679
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah, I get it.

30:16.704 --> 30:18.406
Well, it's time for sound check.

30:18.406 --> 30:21.008
And, girls...

30:21.886 --> 30:23.820
this is your stage.

30:25.089 --> 30:26.345
You're gonna get up there right now

30:26.414 --> 30:27.233
and do sound check.

30:27.289 --> 30:28.222
Do that song you've been working on.

30:31.429 --> 30:33.777
Uh, Daphne and Maddie, everybody.

30:33.814 --> 30:36.383
Yeah!

Hey, babe. I'm in here.

32:57.091 --> 32:59.248
In my daughter's house, no less.

33:00.318 --> 33:01.776
Question is why.

33:02.564 --> 33:03.747
Teddy's not home yet.

33:03.803 --> 33:05.096
Well, that's fine.

33:05.718 --> 33:08.216
I don't have much left to say to him.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.523
If I did, he wouldn't listen to me.

33:11.353 --> 33:13.138
He would, however, listen to you.

33:14.083 --> 33:15.206
About what?

33:16.073 --> 33:18.807
I want you to change his
mind about the stadium site.

33:19.195 --> 33:21.571
'Cause I remember you being quite creative

33:21.596 --> 33:23.830
with accounting on that cumberland deal.

33:24.406 --> 33:26.489
So seems to me you could
come up with something

33:26.514 --> 33:28.166
to make him see things my way.

33:28.286 --> 33:29.487
I don't think so.

33:30.305 --> 33:33.096
But you do think you're
the only person in town

33:33.146 --> 33:34.810
with friends at the tabloids.

33:38.157 --> 33:39.459
Excuse me?

33:39.796 --> 33:42.312
How do you think Teddy'd
feel if he knew it was you

33:42.432 --> 33:44.639
who leaked all those lies about Rayna

33:44.664 --> 33:46.453
and his divorce to the press?

33:47.010 --> 33:50.001
I can't imagine he'd take too kindly to it.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.261
I don't know what you're suggestin'.

33:53.381 --> 33:56.233
I'm suggesting that you cooperate.

34:06.620 --> 34:08.053
Thank you, Brooklyn!

34:09.128 --> 34:10.636
You guys are awesome.

34:10.755 --> 34:11.875
Thank you, everybody.

34:11.900 --> 34:15.402
My next song is my brand-new single.

34:17.024 --> 34:19.232
I'm really excited to
perform in here tonight

34:19.257 --> 34:21.128
and... and for it to be on my new album,

34:21.141 --> 34:23.217
which you guys are all gonna go online

34:23.248 --> 34:24.551
and pre-order tonight, right?

34:28.617 --> 34:31.014
Okay. No, but the, uh,

34:31.070 --> 34:34.210
the best part about singin'
this song tonight for y'all

34:34.255 --> 34:36.163
is, uh, I get to share it with somebody

34:36.206 --> 34:38.239
who means a lot to me,

34:38.264 --> 34:41.505
and who has been

34:41.706 --> 34:44.047
an amazing influence in my life recently.

34:44.277 --> 34:46.293
Um, and that's my mama.

34:48.367 --> 34:50.315
There she is. 

34:55.206 --> 34:57.291
Thank you for being here tonight, mama.

34:57.278 --> 34:58.543
This is for you.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.669
♪ it must have hit me ♪

35:22.086 --> 35:23.285
Hey.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.835
You need to sign this.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.462
No.

35:30.225 --> 35:31.560
You were wrong.

35:32.578 --> 35:35.197
I wasn't mad because you got
an opportunity that I wanted.

35:35.988 --> 35:38.247
I was mad because you
didn't have enough respect

35:38.272 --> 35:40.017
for what was between
us to tell me about it.

35:41.470 --> 35:42.852
Look, I get it.

35:44.542 --> 35:46.431
Avery's a jealous son of a bitch.

35:46.625 --> 35:48.397
He couldn't handle your success.

35:48.431 --> 35:51.233
But I need you to know
that I am not that guy.

35:52.156 --> 35:53.682
I'm the guy who's proud of you

35:53.720 --> 35:55.271
and excited for you.

35:56.129 --> 35:58.090
You sure about that?

35:58.732 --> 36:01.178
Sure that if I watch you
waitin' tables at the Bluebird

36:01.196 --> 36:02.917
instead of doin' what
you're meant to be doin',

36:03.129 --> 36:04.600
I'll never forgive myself.

36:06.258 --> 36:07.733
I'm sure that I love you.

36:11.295 --> 36:13.409
Sign the damn contract, please.

36:25.828 --> 36:27.786
I love you, too.

36:32.753 --> 36:34.136
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey.

36:34.155 --> 36:35.681
Nice to see you.

36:35.737 --> 36:37.183
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:38.109 --> 36:39.711
Those girls of yours...

36:39.773 --> 36:40.330
I know.

36:40.450 --> 36:42.577
Good luck with that.

36:42.583 --> 36:43.709
What am I gonna do?

36:43.690 --> 36:45.379
They'll be fine. They got you.

36:45.435 --> 36:46.399
Hey.

36:48.315 --> 36:50.184
I really like Stacey.

36:51.216 --> 36:52.449
I'm happy for you.

36:52.569 --> 36:54.357
Thank you.

36:55.027 --> 36:56.310
Yeah.

37:01.878 --> 37:03.734
You know, I've been thinking.

37:03.769 --> 37:05.336
Yeah? About what?

37:05.370 --> 37:06.387
Lamar.

37:06.421 --> 37:08.404
I told you, don't worry about him.

37:08.404 --> 37:10.591
No, I'm not. It's just...

37:11.044 --> 37:12.627
maybe we should spend a little more time

37:12.621 --> 37:14.379
considering his stadium site.

37:14.917 --> 37:17.513
There is a lot more
room for expansion there.

37:18.564 --> 37:19.633
No.

37:19.927 --> 37:22.705
Last thing I need is to
be tethered to that man.

37:23.882 --> 37:27.079
Well, he is the most
influential power broker in town.

37:27.693 --> 37:30.070
I wanna see you in the governor's mansion.

37:30.458 --> 37:31.703
And like him or not,

37:31.823 --> 37:33.974
Lamar can help you make that happen.

37:48.624 --> 37:49.772
So where to?

37:49.892 --> 37:52.550
Downtown. Got a bus to catch.

37:52.575 --> 37:53.601
Where you headed?

37:53.632 --> 37:55.903
New York. Joining up with a tour.

37:56.203 --> 37:57.749
Oh, you're a musician?

37:59.119 --> 38:00.301
Roadie.

38:17.909 --> 38:19.815
Why is that so important to you?

38:22.381 --> 38:24.515
Because it means success.

38:24.550 --> 38:26.384
And you know what success means?

38:27.636 --> 38:28.703
Love?

38:31.690 --> 38:34.155
Thank you for helping me with my meeting

38:34.168 --> 38:35.843
and with my mom.

38:36.527 --> 38:38.641
Seems like there's nothing you can't do.

38:40.243 --> 38:41.669
Well, I wouldn't say that.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.864
No, I can't.

38:57.045 --> 38:59.081
You can unless you don't want to.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.127
I think it's a little
more complicated than that.

39:01.247 --> 39:02.847
You know what I like about you?

39:04.186 --> 39:06.453
You see me for who I really am.

39:08.755 --> 39:10.324
- Who I wanna be.
- Juliette, look...

39:10.330 --> 39:12.383
Look, you told me

39:13.083 --> 39:15.436
sometimes we spend so much time

39:15.742 --> 39:17.006
trying to keep out the bad

39:17.000 --> 39:19.553
that we end up missing out on the good.

40:08.267 --> 40:10.051
Easily recognized by his mane.

40:10.085 --> 40:14.772
The male lion's primary
role is serve as protector

40:14.806 --> 40:17.789
while the lioness hunts for prey.

40:25.272 --> 40:26.534
What time is it?

40:26.987 --> 40:29.287
Oh, it's late.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.772
How was the show?

40:32.530 --> 40:34.308
It was good.

40:34.745 --> 40:37.722
I'm sure Rayna and Juliette
brought the house down.

40:37.842 --> 40:38.980
Yes, they did.

40:39.193 --> 40:40.538
And how were you?

40:41.113 --> 40:42.840
I was amazing.

40:45.768 --> 40:46.943
Oh.

40:47.838 --> 40:49.114
I've been thinkin'...

40:49.148 --> 40:50.799
Oh, yeah? About what?

40:51.342 --> 40:53.163
I've been on the road
a long time, you know?

40:53.200 --> 40:54.736
I just...

40:54.770 --> 40:56.638
been everywhere.

40:56.672 --> 40:58.840
Met a lot of interesting people.

41:02.345 --> 41:03.648
Think I had a good run.

41:03.660 --> 41:04.986
"Had"?

41:05.682 --> 41:07.239
Yeah.

41:08.101 --> 41:09.598
There's a lot of things a musician like me

41:09.619 --> 41:11.425
can do in Nashville, you know?

41:11.963 --> 41:12.970
Off the road.

41:13.090 --> 41:14.015
No, Deacon.

41:14.034 --> 41:16.333
- You don't have to do this for me.
- I know.

41:17.052 --> 41:19.161
Maybe I'm just tired of the whole circus.

41:19.987 --> 41:21.497
Maybe I just wanna go home.

41:24.429 --> 41:27.132
Besides, the road is
no place for a new dog.

41:28.514 --> 41:30.247
Or an old one.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.289
You're not old.

41:34.108 --> 41:37.043
No. You're perfect.

41:44.130 --> 41:46.382
You gave those girls...

41:46.658 --> 41:48.785
The thrill of a lifetime.

41:48.973 --> 41:51.706
Thank you. They were
so great, weren't they?

41:51.742 --> 41:52.676
Oh!

41:52.710 --> 41:53.627
Cheers.

41:53.711 --> 41:56.346
- And I heard what you said.
- Hmm?

41:56.380 --> 41:58.770
Although that part that
you threw in about daddy...

41:59.014 --> 41:59.771
low blow.

41:59.777 --> 42:01.142
I had to get your attention somehow.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.699
I don't think that was necessary.

42:02.699 --> 42:04.068
And as I recall,

42:04.188 --> 42:05.828
you used to think he hung the moon.

42:05.834 --> 42:06.998
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah.

42:07.010 --> 42:09.576

42:09.610 --> 42:11.828
- That's not true.

42:12.811 --> 42:14.719

42:14.719 --> 42:15.651

What about the Peggy Kenter situation?

42:17.748 --> 42:19.187

42:19.519 --> 42:21.070

42:21.088 --> 42:22.728
She's not gonna be a problem.

42:23.073 --> 42:24.088
So she's on board.

42:24.079 --> 42:27.921

42:34.418 --> 42:36.380

42:38.133 --> 42:40.052

42:43.394 --> 42:44.361
