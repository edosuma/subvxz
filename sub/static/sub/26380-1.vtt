00:35.417 --> 00:38.159
Carter? Do you
remember how we begin?

00:41.118 --> 00:43.555
100 backwards by 7.

00:45.732 --> 00:49.649
100, 93...

00:51.476 --> 00:52.739
86...

00:56.133 --> 00:57.961
79...

00:59.876 --> 01:01.835
72...

01:07.275 --> 01:09.732
66...

01:09.756 --> 01:11.671
66...

01:15.587 --> 01:18.001
Wait, what was the question?

01:18.025 --> 01:19.705
Carter, can you tell
me how you're feeling?

01:22.116 --> 01:23.552
I'm fine.

01:35.346 --> 01:38.872
My professional assessment?
He looks like shit.

01:40.525 --> 01:43.374
Yeah, I don't like it. But
his vitals are normal.

01:43.398 --> 01:45.376
He's exceeding our
projected variances.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.509
No, something's not right.
Look at that guy.

01:48.533 --> 01:51.730
He looks all kinds of fucked up.

01:51.754 --> 01:53.538
Do you know where you are?

01:55.671 --> 01:56.846
Yes.

01:58.892 --> 02:00.545
Do you know my name?

02:02.243 --> 02:03.679
Carter.

02:05.637 --> 02:07.204
My name is Carter.

02:10.991 --> 02:13.733
Carter, have you
fallen asleep yet?

02:15.996 --> 02:18.061
The sooner you answer, the
sooner we can finish.

02:18.085 --> 02:19.085
No.

02:21.088 --> 02:22.805
I haven't.

02:22.829 --> 02:24.134
Okay.

02:26.136 --> 02:27.877
Take off your jacket, please.

02:29.531 --> 02:30.880
We'll wrap this up.

03:09.136 --> 03:10.635
All right.

03:10.659 --> 03:12.052
Off you go.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.634
Whoa, whoa. What was that?

03:30.897 --> 03:32.178
He just yawned.

03:32.202 --> 03:33.658
No, he took something.

03:33.682 --> 03:36.835
- Like a pill or something.
- What, seriously?

03:36.859 --> 03:38.794
Can you rewind it?

03:46.651 --> 03:48.064
Mm!

03:48.088 --> 03:49.088
Hey.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.440
Hey.

03:57.010 --> 04:00.206
Hey, man. Hey. Right here.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.885
Hey. My headphones.
Where are they?

04:04.495 --> 04:07.039
Or just fucking ignore me.
Fine, dude.

04:07.063 --> 04:09.383
Look, you were the last to have
them, and I need them back.

04:21.555 --> 04:23.577
Hey, are you okay?

04:23.601 --> 04:25.231
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

04:25.255 --> 04:26.624
Carter, what are you...?

05:16.741 --> 05:19.242
Aaah!

05:19.266 --> 05:20.266
Aah!

05:21.790 --> 05:22.985
You know what? I'll
just go ask him.

05:23.009 --> 05:24.987
No, no. What if he lies?

05:25.011 --> 05:26.336
I don't know. We can't
search the guy.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.686
I swear to Christ, if
he fucked this up...

05:28.710 --> 05:30.122
Okay, it's probably
just an aspirin.

05:30.146 --> 05:33.169
Irrelevant. Everything
has to be cleared.

05:33.193 --> 05:36.022
It's Carter! There's
something wrong!

05:39.460 --> 05:41.264
Carter. Having a
little meltdown?

05:41.288 --> 05:43.831
I get it, buddy. It's
one of those days.

05:43.855 --> 05:46.075
Open up. We'll talk
about it, okay?

05:48.686 --> 05:50.795
Carter? Carter, can you hear me?

05:50.819 --> 05:53.319
I need you to unlock
this door, please.

05:53.343 --> 05:54.277
Get the keys.

05:54.301 --> 05:56.409
Get the keys.

05:56.433 --> 05:58.305
Aah!

06:00.481 --> 06:03.634
Carter. It's okay, man.
Open the door.

06:03.658 --> 06:05.549
Where are the bloody keys?!

06:11.013 --> 06:14.340
Oh, fuck me!

07:16.252 --> 07:19.840
Head contusions,
multiple lacerations,

07:19.864 --> 07:23.105
including a fatal wound
to the jugular vein,

07:23.129 --> 07:27.413
and he gouged out his own eyes

07:27.437 --> 07:30.571
with a piece of a coffee mug.

07:32.094 --> 07:34.986
Mr. Slater, can
you tell me a bit

07:35.010 --> 07:38.753
about Mr. Carter's behavior
these last few weeks?

07:39.971 --> 07:41.688
Erratic.

07:41.712 --> 07:45.257
Typical systems of
prolonged sleeplessness.

07:45.281 --> 07:49.609
Yes. But can you
elaborate on that?

07:49.633 --> 07:52.047
His behavior is...

07:52.071 --> 07:53.961
It's well documented.

07:53.985 --> 07:56.268
There were no red flags,
absolutely no indication

07:56.292 --> 07:58.531
he was a danger to himself.

07:58.555 --> 07:59.793
Go on.

07:59.817 --> 08:03.319
Limited visual and
auditory hallucinations,

08:03.343 --> 08:05.495
irritability, general confusion,

08:05.519 --> 08:08.802
uh, degradation of
hand-to-eye coordination.

08:08.826 --> 08:12.110
A high concentration of
adenosine in his blood work.

08:12.134 --> 08:15.548
Yes, Francine, we have all
of that in our notes.

08:15.572 --> 08:17.357
But how was he behaving?

08:19.620 --> 08:21.230
Uh...

08:23.798 --> 08:27.865
Did he mention suicide at
any point, Mr. Gillman?

08:27.889 --> 08:29.997
Any recurring darker thoughts?

08:30.021 --> 08:31.608
He was an undergrad

08:31.632 --> 08:34.828
at a high-pressure
psychology program.

08:34.852 --> 08:37.222
Of course he talked
about suicide.

08:37.246 --> 08:40.225
So he mentioned suicide?

08:40.249 --> 08:42.880
Well, fuck if I know. I
never talked to him.

08:42.904 --> 08:45.361
I have my own shit
to worry about.

08:45.385 --> 08:47.754
Is there anything else
that you can tell us?

08:47.778 --> 08:50.583
He signed the release form.

08:50.607 --> 08:52.479
We never said it would
be easy, Your Honor.

08:54.220 --> 08:57.286
This isn't a courtroom,
Mr. Gillman.

08:57.310 --> 08:59.834
Then why do I feel
like I'm on trial?

09:01.009 --> 09:03.814
He was a sweet kid.

09:03.838 --> 09:06.425
I-I tried to talk to him.

09:06.449 --> 09:08.123
I tried to talk to all of them,

09:08.147 --> 09:12.083
but, you know, there's...
There's only so much time.

09:12.107 --> 09:13.606
I-I tried to make sure

09:13.630 --> 09:17.349
that everyone was taken
care of and safe

09:17.373 --> 09:20.222
and happy and all that, but...

09:20.246 --> 09:22.267
But you personally didn't
have any indication

09:22.291 --> 09:23.094
that this was gonna happen?

09:23.118 --> 09:25.488
No, not at all.

09:25.512 --> 09:26.924
Anything like that,

09:26.948 --> 09:30.971
we're obligated to
document it immediately.

09:30.995 --> 09:35.237
Look, I'm really
sorry he's dead.

09:35.261 --> 09:38.786
But I don't know if there's
much more I can add, really.

09:44.183 --> 09:47.031
Let me get this
straight, Dr. Whatley.

09:47.055 --> 09:50.382
You're... You're treating
sleep like an illness?

09:50.406 --> 09:52.254
Without bothering you
with the science,

09:52.278 --> 09:54.647
the military has been
developing wakefulness drugs

09:54.671 --> 09:58.042
beyond your normal
amphetamines for decades now.

09:58.066 --> 09:59.217
Our solution...

09:59.241 --> 10:03.743
Your drug, this, uh, "Cognifin"?

10:03.767 --> 10:05.354
Cogniphan.

10:05.378 --> 10:08.008
Rather than addressing
the symptoms,

10:08.032 --> 10:12.012
acts directly on the cerebral
cortex and reticular formation.

10:12.036 --> 10:14.101
I'm sorry, you're what?

10:14.125 --> 10:16.302
We're trying to cure sleep.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.283
And how did Carter's physiology

10:21.307 --> 10:24.677
reflect his reaction
to your drug?

10:24.701 --> 10:25.920
It didn't.

10:27.748 --> 10:30.292
Come again?

10:30.316 --> 10:31.989
Carter never reacted
to the Cogniphan.

10:32.013 --> 10:33.144
He was the control.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.107
He never took the drug.

11:03.174 --> 11:04.174
How's your mum?

11:05.351 --> 11:07.590
Questions about my mom? Really?

11:07.614 --> 11:08.832
Thanks, Freud.

11:15.143 --> 11:18.601
Idiopathic hypersomnia.

11:18.625 --> 11:22.082
Of course, it's not like
anything they've ever seen.

11:22.106 --> 11:25.216
That's the diagnosis they
pulled out of their ass today.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.807
I'm sorry.

11:30.811 --> 11:32.291
So...

11:33.379 --> 11:36.662
I heard you told the board
Carter was the control.

11:36.686 --> 11:37.992
I did.

11:40.342 --> 11:41.450
All right.

11:41.474 --> 11:42.494
Look, I'm fine with
that, you know?

11:42.518 --> 11:43.713
I'm just putting that out there.

11:43.737 --> 11:44.888
Lying to the board,
I'm totally okay...

11:44.912 --> 11:46.368
You know they wouldn't
have understood.

11:46.392 --> 11:47.847
Hey, I'm agreeing
with you, Ella.

11:47.871 --> 11:49.762
They were looking to
throw me to the wolves.

11:49.786 --> 11:51.111
If they could pin his
death on the Cogniphan,

11:51.135 --> 11:52.722
then that's all they would need.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.159
Sure, but you don't think
it was the Cogniphan?

11:55.183 --> 11:56.856
No.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.510
It was whatever else he was
taking with the Cogniphan.

11:58.534 --> 11:59.859
I watched the tapes.
He was tak...

11:59.883 --> 12:02.340
- Trazodone.
- What?

12:02.364 --> 12:04.864
I searched his room before
EMS and the police arrived.

12:04.888 --> 12:07.389
He had a prescription for it.

12:07.413 --> 12:09.695
Lied about his on his
application to the study.

12:09.719 --> 12:11.915
Oh, Jesus.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.656
How long till the board
gets back to you?

12:13.680 --> 12:14.526
I don't know.

12:14.550 --> 12:15.745
Could be tomorrow,

12:15.769 --> 12:16.876
could be before the
fall semester begins.

12:16.900 --> 12:19.139
So it's just indefinite?

12:19.163 --> 12:22.839
That's the exact phrase.
"Indefinite suspension."

12:22.863 --> 12:24.971
Great.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.495
You didn't tell them
about us, did you?

12:26.519 --> 12:28.347
What? No.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.197
Thank you.

12:33.221 --> 12:35.286
You don't have to thank me.

12:35.310 --> 12:36.529
I like you.

12:38.313 --> 12:39.682
So, what now?

12:39.706 --> 12:43.294
Now I have two weeks

12:43.318 --> 12:47.777
to clean out my office,
and that's it.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.822
You have two weeks.

12:49.846 --> 12:51.587
Until June 14th.

12:54.764 --> 12:57.134
And the building will be
completely empty then, won't it?

12:57.158 --> 13:00.117
Yeah. Why?

13:02.424 --> 13:03.967
Okay, call the team, everyone.

13:03.991 --> 13:06.448
Tell them to meet in the
classroom tomorrow morning.

13:06.472 --> 13:07.995
Thank you.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.601
What are you seeing?

13:50.646 --> 13:51.646
What are you looking at?

14:14.844 --> 14:15.844
Hello?

14:26.900 --> 14:29.879
Look, I-I know. I know
you wanted to get rich.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.533
You know, so did I. Yay, money.

14:31.557 --> 14:34.405
But don't they see that we
could really help people?

14:34.429 --> 14:37.060
I mean, we could
really do some good.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.931
I don't want to be mean,
but aren't they just...

14:38.955 --> 14:40.716
Old fuckers with
sticks up their asses?

14:40.740 --> 14:42.848
Yes, they are.

14:42.872 --> 14:44.284
Well, I was gonna
say shortsighted,

14:44.308 --> 14:45.701
but that works too.

14:49.488 --> 14:52.031
I guess I could teach.

14:52.055 --> 14:55.992
Getting my certification
wouldn't be too hard.

14:56.016 --> 14:58.037
Throwing myself off a cliff
wouldn't be too hard either.

14:58.061 --> 14:59.735
Yeah. No shit.

14:59.759 --> 15:03.303
Fuck that. Teaching? Hell no!
Publish or perish!

15:03.327 --> 15:06.959
Look, if... If we don't
finish this thing,

15:06.983 --> 15:09.005
I go back to working
at RadioShack.

15:09.029 --> 15:11.442
And fuck that.

15:11.466 --> 15:13.705
My student loans are maxed.

15:13.729 --> 15:15.838
I'm tapped.

15:15.862 --> 15:18.493
It's not like I can just
start a new dissertation.

15:18.517 --> 15:21.147
I mean, I have a
bachelor's in psychology.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.409
What am I supposed
to do with that?

15:22.433 --> 15:24.977
What if they bring us
up on criminal charges?

15:25.001 --> 15:26.762
Oh, yeah.

15:26.786 --> 15:28.372
Jail? Is that where we're at?

15:28.396 --> 15:31.418
Oh, God. We are so fucked.

15:31.442 --> 15:33.595
- No one's going to jail.
- Oh!

15:33.619 --> 15:35.771
Okay, good, good, good!

15:35.795 --> 15:38.537
'Cause if that's a
possibility, then I'm...

15:40.016 --> 15:43.126
- I'm... I'm going to Mexico.
- I could do Mexico.

15:43.150 --> 15:46.999
I could go to a beach,
margaritas, all that.

15:47.023 --> 15:48.068
Yeah.

15:50.070 --> 15:52.614
Okay. Um, I'll go pack a bag.

15:52.638 --> 15:55.268
We can leave in like 20
minutes if you want to.

15:55.292 --> 15:58.924
No one's going to jail.
We're gonna fix this.

15:58.948 --> 16:00.622
We're close.

16:00.646 --> 16:03.102
We're too close to
just abandon this.

16:03.126 --> 16:05.409
School just let out
for the summer.

16:05.433 --> 16:08.847
Everyone's gone home, even
the janitors for two weeks.

16:08.871 --> 16:11.633
We have the research,
we're all here.

16:11.657 --> 16:13.983
And we have the key to the lab.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.443
Oh.

16:16.792 --> 16:17.943
Oh, wow.

16:17.967 --> 16:20.380
A clandestine experiment?

16:20.404 --> 16:23.906
Okay, but then what?

16:23.930 --> 16:26.454
Well, we don't even know if it
was working properly, right?

16:28.369 --> 16:30.739
Look at the numbers.

16:30.763 --> 16:33.785
At 96 hours without sleep,

16:33.809 --> 16:35.961
we start to see upticks
in brain wave activity,

16:35.985 --> 16:39.835
both in cognitive
tests and in vitals,

16:39.859 --> 16:42.489
all of it statistically
significant.

16:42.513 --> 16:46.276
Based on these projections,
and this is just an estimate,

16:46.300 --> 16:48.626
we will hit the lucidity
point in 8.3 days...

16:48.650 --> 16:50.236
That's roughly 200 hours...

16:50.260 --> 16:52.543
Once the Cogniphan's
administered.

16:52.567 --> 16:54.371
That's the threshold
we need to hit.

16:54.395 --> 16:57.287
That's when we break through.

16:57.311 --> 17:00.899
And the need for
sleep is just gone.

17:00.923 --> 17:03.206
I'm sorry, but
shouldn't we go back

17:03.230 --> 17:04.903
to testing in the second phase?

17:04.926 --> 17:07.906
I mean, I really don't want
to shoot up those monkeys,

17:07.930 --> 17:09.386
but after what
happened to Carter...

17:09.410 --> 17:11.606
You saw the research.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.433
The results from the
simian studies were sound.

17:13.457 --> 17:17.133
- I hate to be callous, but...
- Sure you do.

17:17.156 --> 17:20.223
I hate to be callous, but
Carter was manically depressed

17:20.247 --> 17:22.398
and had you have vetted him
properly, we would've seen that.

17:22.423 --> 17:24.880
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

17:24.904 --> 17:27.709
We're right there.

17:27.733 --> 17:29.885
This is going to work.

17:29.909 --> 17:31.451
I don't know, you guys.

17:31.475 --> 17:33.279
I... I think we should
get another opinion.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.978
All right.

17:36.002 --> 17:39.242
We could take this and get
some grants, go private.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.939
But I don't think any of
you want to hand this over

17:40.963 --> 17:42.123
to a corporation, am I right?

17:43.487 --> 17:46.641
I mean, we worked
too hard on this.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.294
There's no reason to wait
for a big pharmaceutical

17:48.318 --> 17:49.668
to discover this.

17:52.235 --> 17:53.648
Maybe we could wait and
see what the board says,

17:53.672 --> 17:55.432
if they'll let us continue,

17:55.456 --> 17:57.456
but I think we all know
that isn't going to happen.

18:01.244 --> 18:04.484
This isn't about finishing
our degrees, guys.

18:04.508 --> 18:08.532
And, Ella, I'm sorry, but this
isn't even about your job.

18:08.556 --> 18:10.969
This is bigger.

18:10.993 --> 18:13.929
I mean, guys, we joked
about this, right?

18:13.953 --> 18:16.758
About changing the world!

18:16.782 --> 18:19.959
That is exactly what this is.

18:21.177 --> 18:24.287
A world without sleep, right?
Just think about it.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.593
It wouldn't just increase
workforce productivity

18:26.617 --> 18:27.812
and make for a better soldier.

18:27.836 --> 18:29.248
It would give our
best and brightest

18:29.272 --> 18:30.728
a third of their lives back.

18:30.752 --> 18:32.817
Time spent developing new
fuels or curing disease,

18:32.841 --> 18:35.559
eliminating poverty.

18:35.583 --> 18:41.217
Guys, if we're right... And
I think that we are...

18:41.241 --> 18:43.547
We could change the
course of human history.

18:44.810 --> 18:47.160
Okay, no.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.965
No, no.

18:49.989 --> 18:53.011
There... There's no way we can
get undergrad volunteers now.

18:53.035 --> 18:56.798
You're right. That's why
we're the subjects.

18:56.822 --> 19:00.018
Ella... Dr. Whatley...
will monitor.

19:00.042 --> 19:03.630
Because one success
is all we need.

19:03.654 --> 19:06.745
Shit, guys, are you serious?

19:08.572 --> 19:11.726
I mean, you saw that kid, right?

19:11.750 --> 19:14.119
You saw his... his face?

19:14.143 --> 19:17.166
Yeah, okay, I'd rather not
claw my own eyes out.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.689
Pass.

19:18.713 --> 19:22.562
Look, Carter was on trazodone,
250 milligrams per day.

19:22.586 --> 19:23.849
That's a big dose.

19:25.328 --> 19:26.741
He's right.

19:26.765 --> 19:28.525
In the rhesus monkey trials,

19:28.549 --> 19:31.160
there were zero instances of
self-harm or dangerous behavior.

19:33.510 --> 19:36.446
Guys, you've seen the research.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.080
You've got it.

19:39.299 --> 19:40.996
You know it works.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.264
Okay.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.528
I'm in.

19:54.531 --> 19:55.421
Me too.

19:55.445 --> 19:59.014
Ohhh. Shit.

20:01.625 --> 20:05.257
All right. Okay. I'm in.

20:05.281 --> 20:09.218
But wait, um, we need
a control, right?

20:09.242 --> 20:13.396
Okay, I don't mean to sound
like a pussy, but that's me.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.181
I'm the control.

20:16.205 --> 20:17.903
Yeah, man, cool.

20:19.687 --> 20:21.515
Are you sure about this?

20:24.257 --> 20:25.712
Yes.

20:25.736 --> 20:28.280
But we need to start right away.

20:28.304 --> 20:29.673
Yeah.

20:29.697 --> 20:31.501
And it's not gonna be easy.

20:31.525 --> 20:34.833
200 hours without sleep.
We all know that.

20:36.617 --> 20:38.924
We have to be in.

20:41.491 --> 20:42.841
All the way in.

20:45.887 --> 20:47.212
That's what she said.

21:03.252 --> 21:05.927
Camera. Check.

21:05.951 --> 21:08.581
- EEG.
- Yep.

21:08.605 --> 21:10.825
- BP.
- Check.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.632
And is our control ready?

21:15.656 --> 21:17.112
What's in that?

21:17.136 --> 21:18.896
You know how we've had some
trouble with the control

21:18.920 --> 21:20.158
staying involved
and awake, right?

21:20.182 --> 21:22.160
- Yeah.
- Well, this is the answer.

21:22.184 --> 21:24.336
It's an assortment of
vitamins, glucose,

21:24.360 --> 21:26.948
and a dash of
concentrated caffeine.

21:26.972 --> 21:29.472
It's all natural and
should help you keep pace

21:29.496 --> 21:30.777
whenever you're feeling tired.

21:30.801 --> 21:33.345
- Everyone ready?
- Yeah.

21:33.369 --> 21:34.999
Here we go.

21:48.950 --> 21:50.841
So I just have to sit here?

21:50.865 --> 21:54.410
You know how this works.
You've got 45 more minutes.

21:54.434 --> 21:56.891
This will provide us real-time
measurements of all your vitals.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.893
Great.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.286
Wait. Why do we have
a defibrillator?

22:01.310 --> 22:03.095
Can I play with it?

22:04.879 --> 22:06.552
I'd rather you not.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.598
Now, you...

22:08.622 --> 22:10.469
Chimpanzee games.

22:10.493 --> 22:13.777
Yes. Can you do
better than a monkey?

22:13.801 --> 22:15.910
An... An ape.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.389
Of the genus Pan.
Pan troglodyte.

22:17.413 --> 22:20.001
You really need to
work on your taxonomy.

22:20.025 --> 22:21.698
Sorry, I'm nervous.

22:21.722 --> 22:24.159
When I say go.

22:25.726 --> 22:26.833
Go.

22:29.208 --> 22:31.882
So far I've just
started to see smoke.

22:31.906 --> 22:36.017
You know, it's common.
I get that.

22:39.218 --> 22:41.370
Everything's so loud.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.178
It's like I'm...

22:44.658 --> 22:48.768
wading through wet cement.

22:48.792 --> 22:51.597
100, 93,

22:51.621 --> 22:55.253
86, 82...

22:55.277 --> 22:57.279
That's... That's
not right, is it?

22:59.412 --> 23:02.217
Like the volume's
turned all the way up.

23:02.241 --> 23:04.175
Doors closing sound
like gunshots.

23:06.854 --> 23:09.093
I forgot what I was saying.

23:09.117 --> 23:10.877
Hey...

23:10.901 --> 23:13.097
All right, give me
the fucking shot.

23:13.121 --> 23:15.186
Give me the shot.

23:15.210 --> 23:16.927
Okay!

23:16.951 --> 23:18.798
There's the party, right there!

23:18.822 --> 23:20.365
Okay.

23:20.389 --> 23:22.000
Ow.

23:24.393 --> 23:28.136
We're over 50 hours in, and I'm
on my third dose of Cogniphan.

23:34.795 --> 23:36.860
I'm feeling the effects
of going without sleep,

23:36.884 --> 23:40.322
but the edge is taken off.

23:42.020 --> 23:45.173
In between the... the shaking
and the general unsteadiness,

23:45.197 --> 23:47.025
I'm experiencing...

23:52.030 --> 23:54.075
moments of clarity.

23:56.817 --> 23:58.795
That's it.

23:58.819 --> 24:00.473
That's the drug.

24:02.866 --> 24:05.739
There's an immediate effect once
the Cogniphan's administered.

24:06.957 --> 24:09.221
But it also builds
up over time...

24:13.616 --> 24:16.726
based on metabolism and...
and diet

24:16.750 --> 24:18.143
and that sort of thing.

24:20.145 --> 24:23.211
If my projections are correct,

24:23.235 --> 24:27.171
these moments of clarity will
continue up until 200 hours.

24:27.195 --> 24:29.086
Then the shaking,
the hallucinations,

24:29.110 --> 24:31.001
the paranoia will all go away,

24:31.025 --> 24:34.222
cognitive functions
will be fully restored,

24:34.246 --> 24:37.834
and we change the fucking world.

24:37.858 --> 24:39.990
The lucidity point.

25:10.108 --> 25:12.260
You okay?

25:12.284 --> 25:13.739
Uh, oh, yeah.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.785
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

25:15.809 --> 25:18.092
Just sore.

25:18.116 --> 25:20.529
Old cheerleading injury.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.748
You were a cheerleader?

25:22.772 --> 25:24.489
Yeah.

25:24.513 --> 25:25.751
- Don't laugh.
- I'm not.

25:25.775 --> 25:26.970
Yes, you are.

25:26.994 --> 25:28.972
Well, it's just,

25:28.996 --> 25:31.801
you know, you don't really
look like a cheerleader.

25:31.825 --> 25:34.804
Like, in a good way.
It's a good thing.

25:34.828 --> 25:36.177
Thanks.

25:37.396 --> 25:39.374
Not to brag, but, um,

25:39.398 --> 25:42.028
while the jocks were out
there butting heads

25:42.052 --> 25:44.814
and, you know, jerking
each other off,

25:44.838 --> 25:46.468
I learned how to give
one hell of a back rub.

25:46.492 --> 25:49.669
- On who?
- Just mostly my mom.

25:52.324 --> 25:55.694
- Um...
- Do you want to touch me?

26:00.114 --> 26:01.159
Okay.

26:15.390 --> 26:18.804
It's not too late for
Mexico, you know?

26:18.828 --> 26:21.372
Slow down there, gringo.

26:21.396 --> 26:24.070
Still have a few
more days to go.

26:24.094 --> 26:25.942
Oh, I know.

26:25.966 --> 26:28.162
No, I'm just throwing
it out there.

26:28.186 --> 26:30.990
Like, underhanded.

26:31.014 --> 26:33.515
Nice and slow.

26:33.539 --> 26:36.648
Hoping you might want
to, uh, take a swing.

26:47.379 --> 26:49.531
Do you hear that?

26:49.555 --> 26:51.185
Hear what?

26:51.209 --> 26:55.517
Holly, you're such
a fricking weirdo!

26:58.128 --> 26:59.932
I mean, look at you!
You're so gross!

26:59.956 --> 27:01.847
Are you okay?

27:01.871 --> 27:03.438
Pathetic!

27:07.312 --> 27:09.333
You are such a loser!

27:16.669 --> 27:17.974
You okay?

27:21.064 --> 27:23.676
You're really starting
to freak me out.

27:29.334 --> 27:32.356
Frannie? You wanted to see me?

27:32.380 --> 27:35.253
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

27:39.169 --> 27:40.823
Tell me what you see.

27:43.957 --> 27:45.587
I don't know, it's
Carter and that one kid

27:45.611 --> 27:48.111
what's-his-name, uh, Aaron.

27:48.135 --> 27:50.268
Look closer. Right here.

27:55.403 --> 27:58.121
I don't know. What is it?

27:58.145 --> 28:00.297
Just describe it to me.

28:00.321 --> 28:02.201
I need to know that we're
seeing the same thing.

28:04.586 --> 28:06.109
It looks like a...

28:08.068 --> 28:11.134
Kind of looks like
a visual artifact.

28:11.158 --> 28:13.658
But something. Right there.

28:13.682 --> 28:17.619
I guess. I mean, I could kind
of see something, maybe.

28:17.643 --> 28:19.688
Here. What about here?

28:24.345 --> 28:26.236
The same, Frannie. It's just a blur.
It's nothing.

28:26.260 --> 28:28.586
What are you getting at?

28:28.610 --> 28:31.197
Here it is blown up.

28:31.221 --> 28:32.677
Okay, so?

28:32.701 --> 28:36.333
So it's everywhere.
It's all around.

28:36.357 --> 28:38.509
17 different instances.

28:38.533 --> 28:43.122
Frannie, it's just a blur, okay?

28:43.146 --> 28:45.647
I mean, please don't tell
me you think it's a ghost.

28:45.671 --> 28:46.735
But you see it too.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.040
After you told me
to look for it.

28:48.064 --> 28:49.651
It's like hearing
"Paul is dead."

28:49.675 --> 28:51.087
You're seeing patterns
where there are none.

28:51.111 --> 28:54.133
No, you described it before
I planted the suggestion.

28:54.157 --> 28:56.222
Look, Frannie, maybe the lab
screwed these up, okay?

28:56.246 --> 28:57.702
Those cameras are outdated.

28:57.726 --> 29:00.836
Those tapes have been recorded
over dozens of times.

29:00.860 --> 29:04.361
You're getting worked up over
seeing Jesus in a tortilla.

29:04.385 --> 29:06.320
You don't want
this in your head,

29:06.344 --> 29:08.215
but I have to show you.

29:29.802 --> 29:32.737
Whoa, whoa. What the
fuck is that, Frannie?

29:32.761 --> 29:37.568
Joe, it wasn't there
the other day

29:37.592 --> 29:39.440
when I watched it
the first time.

29:39.464 --> 29:41.442
That's... That's not possible.
What, are you fucking with me?

29:41.466 --> 29:42.660
No, no. You know I'm not.

29:42.684 --> 29:45.750
It's like it's
coming into focus.

29:45.774 --> 29:48.840
No. No, Frannie, this is...

29:48.864 --> 29:50.625
This isn't a thing. It can't be.

29:50.649 --> 29:53.236
There is no thing there.

29:53.260 --> 29:54.716
Then what is it?

29:54.740 --> 29:58.676
What's the common denominator?

29:58.700 --> 30:00.591
- The Cogniphan.
- The Cogniphan.

30:00.615 --> 30:01.723
But there's nothing
in the formula

30:01.747 --> 30:05.161
that would kick-start
hallucinations.

30:05.185 --> 30:07.424
Maybe it's just insomnia.

30:07.448 --> 30:08.730
Better than the alternative.

30:08.754 --> 30:11.409
- Which is what?
- That this is real.

30:30.428 --> 30:32.560
Mm. Uh-oh.

30:44.050 --> 30:45.506
Mm-hmm.

30:52.275 --> 30:53.451
There it is.

30:57.193 --> 30:59.433
Hmm.

30:59.457 --> 31:00.675
Too bad.

31:02.503 --> 31:04.525
No, don't stab her in the boob.

31:04.549 --> 31:05.550
No.

31:14.341 --> 31:16.667
Ba-caw! Ba-caw!

31:24.656 --> 31:27.615
Joseph.

31:32.011 --> 31:34.535
Joseph.

32:11.224 --> 32:12.549
Jesus.

32:16.446 --> 32:18.013
Are you seeing it too?

32:34.595 --> 32:36.684
What's all this about?

32:43.648 --> 32:45.582
We all agree we've been
seeing things, right?

32:45.606 --> 32:48.803
- Yeah.
- Uh, sure.

32:48.827 --> 32:50.761
Okay.

32:50.785 --> 32:53.851
Well, draw it.

32:53.875 --> 32:57.028
- Draw what?
- You know what.

33:04.277 --> 33:06.734
Don't show anyone, don't
talk about it, just draw it.

33:06.758 --> 33:08.760
Then fold it over. I
don't want to see it.

34:15.827 --> 34:17.543
Okay. Show us what you've got.

34:17.567 --> 34:20.895
All right, look, I don't
want to be an ass here,

34:20.918 --> 34:25.726
really, but, um, this
doesn't prove anything.

34:25.750 --> 34:28.380
We are not blind participants.

34:28.404 --> 34:30.382
Look, we have been
living with each other.

34:30.406 --> 34:32.820
Look, it's the best we can do.

34:32.844 --> 34:36.411
All right. I'm not going first.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.954
The day my dog died, there
was a thunderstorm.

34:57.782 --> 35:00.001
And he got scared and ran.

35:01.524 --> 35:03.004
And he got hit by a truck.

35:06.791 --> 35:08.706
When it's quiet...

35:10.272 --> 35:11.970
I can hear him screaming.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.277
It was the worst day of my life.

35:30.031 --> 35:32.425
Oh, no. Joe, your mom.

35:34.993 --> 35:36.472
Are you seeing
something like this?

35:38.779 --> 35:41.410
- Kind of.
- Kind of?

35:41.434 --> 35:43.218
What's different? Show me.

35:45.525 --> 35:46.874
Oh. Flip it.

35:48.441 --> 35:49.766
Is that a...

35:49.790 --> 35:51.899
Dick with arms,
drinking a martini.

35:51.923 --> 35:53.944
Yeah.

35:53.968 --> 35:57.774
Really? Goddamn it, Dale!

35:57.798 --> 35:59.733
Why is he drinking a martini?

35:59.757 --> 36:02.257
Well, he had a really tough
day at the office, and, uh...

36:02.281 --> 36:04.912
Seriously? You haven't
seen anything like this?

36:04.936 --> 36:06.198
No.

36:11.769 --> 36:13.640
- Sweetheart...
- Let her finish.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.578
Ella, with the monkey trials,
did you see anything like this?

36:19.602 --> 36:23.844
They didn't draw any monkey
pricks, if that's what you mean.

36:23.868 --> 36:26.803
When you were working with them,
administering the Cogniphan,

36:26.827 --> 36:28.196
did anything like this happen?

36:28.220 --> 36:29.937
The rhesus monkeys were fine.

36:29.961 --> 36:31.503
They were agitated for a while,

36:31.527 --> 36:34.115
but nothing you wouldn't expect
out of sleep deprivation.

36:34.139 --> 36:36.508
Are we in danger?

36:36.532 --> 36:37.969
I'm finished.

36:57.553 --> 36:59.077
She doesn't see it.

37:02.384 --> 37:04.972
I've shown Ella all the footage,
Frannie's photos, everything.

37:04.996 --> 37:06.780
She just doesn't see it.

37:12.394 --> 37:14.832
I still don't even
know if Ihave.

37:17.835 --> 37:19.725
I've heard it.

37:19.749 --> 37:21.945
I think I understand
what it's trying to say,

37:21.969 --> 37:24.905
because when it speaks,

37:24.929 --> 37:28.106
it's, like, inside my brain.

37:31.109 --> 37:33.827
It's, like, there sometimes,

37:33.851 --> 37:38.290
um, moving things
around inside my head.

37:40.596 --> 37:42.120
Makes it hard to think.

37:49.214 --> 37:51.172
It's like it's looking
for something.

37:55.350 --> 37:57.265
I think it wants me to sleep.

37:59.572 --> 38:01.269
I'd like that.

38:03.141 --> 38:04.882
To sleep.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.886
And to not see it anymore.

38:14.717 --> 38:16.328
I know it's there.

38:18.939 --> 38:21.700
See, it's just infrasound, man.

38:21.724 --> 38:23.267
When the human ear
picks up frequencies

38:23.291 --> 38:25.269
between 7 and 19 kilohertz,

38:25.293 --> 38:28.577
it's theorized that it can
cause hallucinations.

38:28.601 --> 38:32.276
So maybe there was a
stray sound in the air

38:32.300 --> 38:35.236
or the rattling of an
air conditioner vent

38:35.260 --> 38:38.848
or the imperceptible
hum of machinery.

38:38.872 --> 38:40.308
But, uh...

38:41.875 --> 38:44.878
it makes us feel like we're
being haunted or some shit.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.794
It's just bad vibes.

38:51.885 --> 38:54.690
It's watching us.

38:54.714 --> 38:57.127
I can feel it.

38:57.151 --> 38:59.129
I keep telling
myself, it's like...

38:59.153 --> 39:02.219
It's like when you think about
spiders all over your body,

39:02.243 --> 39:04.363
and then all of a sudden you
start itching, but I'm...

39:05.594 --> 39:06.702
Um...

39:09.337 --> 39:11.098
See?

39:11.122 --> 39:13.796
Here. See? See? Right there.

39:13.820 --> 39:15.406
It keeps getting clearer.

39:15.430 --> 39:17.713
Every day that we're awake,
it keeps getting clearer,

39:17.737 --> 39:20.348
and it keeps getting closer.

39:26.441 --> 39:28.356
You probably can't even see it.

39:29.879 --> 39:32.186
I don't even know why
I'm showing it to you.

39:52.511 --> 39:54.315
All right, buddy, you've
got about 30 minutes.

39:54.339 --> 39:56.297
I'm gonna get some
fresh air, okay?

41:27.649 --> 41:29.173
Joseph!

42:25.272 --> 42:27.448
Eye of the tiger.

42:53.257 --> 42:54.973
Ella!

43:05.704 --> 43:07.923
Ella! Ella!

43:09.011 --> 43:10.011
Ella!

43:14.408 --> 43:16.193
Ella!

43:29.031 --> 43:30.207
Fuck.

43:37.170 --> 43:38.974
Joe?

43:38.998 --> 43:40.129
Joe?!

43:42.697 --> 43:46.266
Joe? What in heavens
are you doing?

43:50.096 --> 43:52.446
Joe, you're upsetting me.

43:54.405 --> 43:56.470
There's got to be
something in here.

43:56.494 --> 43:59.845
A hammer, a tire iron.
Something.

44:03.327 --> 44:04.652
Explain it to me.

44:04.676 --> 44:07.742
- Please.
- You saw our drawings, right?

44:07.766 --> 44:09.134
Yes.

44:09.158 --> 44:12.312
Then you understand that
I might want something.

44:12.336 --> 44:14.705
A tire iron, a golf
club, or something

44:14.729 --> 44:16.316
so I'm not completely
fucking naked

44:16.340 --> 44:17.447
when that thing comes back.

44:17.471 --> 44:18.666
What thing?

44:18.690 --> 44:21.277
Joe, I need you to
pause for a moment

44:21.301 --> 44:24.237
and realize how erratic
you're behaving right now.

44:24.261 --> 44:25.847
No. No weapons.

44:25.871 --> 44:29.503
No weapons? No weapons?
Fuck you, Ella!

44:29.527 --> 44:31.244
I'm not gonna be
completely unarmed

44:31.268 --> 44:32.549
when that thing comes back!

44:32.573 --> 44:35.335
- I am not!
- There is no thing, Joe.

44:35.359 --> 44:36.466
And there's no boogeyman.

44:36.490 --> 44:37.685
And you're in no condition

44:37.709 --> 44:39.774
to be handling firearms
or knives or...

44:39.798 --> 44:42.994
Or even casual conversation,
for Pete's sake!

44:43.018 --> 44:44.890
You're right.

44:46.413 --> 44:47.869
Why don't we just
smile at the thing

44:47.893 --> 44:50.287
and ask it to sit down and talk?

44:51.984 --> 44:54.484
I can craft some
effective weapons

44:54.508 --> 44:56.356
out of things we'd find
around the kitchen.

44:56.380 --> 44:57.574
No!

44:57.598 --> 44:59.446
I can turn the defibrillator

44:59.470 --> 45:01.665
into a stun gun.

45:01.689 --> 45:03.363
Or I can put together
a potato gun.

45:03.387 --> 45:05.060
Absolutely not, Dale.

45:05.084 --> 45:07.236
Joe, you're getting
everyone worked up.

45:07.260 --> 45:08.629
What did the monkeys do?

45:08.653 --> 45:10.935
What monkeys?

45:10.959 --> 45:12.328
"What monkeys"?

45:12.352 --> 45:15.592
The rhesus monkeys. The
fucking primate trials.

45:15.616 --> 45:17.725
You saw the results.

45:17.749 --> 45:19.379
Are we really getting
into this again?

45:19.403 --> 45:24.016
Okay. Please, please
don't judge me.

45:25.322 --> 45:27.019
But I can't do this anymore.

45:28.237 --> 45:30.152
It's just not worth it.

45:31.371 --> 45:34.045
And you guys can keep going.
I really hope you do.

45:34.069 --> 45:36.221
And I promise I won't tell
the university or anything,

45:36.245 --> 45:38.335
but I need to go home.

45:40.337 --> 45:42.532
It's okay, Frannie.

45:42.556 --> 45:44.012
It's okay.

45:44.036 --> 45:45.036
No way.

45:46.255 --> 45:48.364
What?

45:48.388 --> 45:49.650
No.

45:50.869 --> 45:51.889
No, fuck no!

45:51.913 --> 45:53.282
Dale. Calm down.

45:53.306 --> 45:56.154
No, you calm the fuck down!

45:56.178 --> 45:57.982
She can't leave!

45:58.006 --> 46:01.812
If she leaves, we are done.

46:01.836 --> 46:04.424
It's over.

46:04.448 --> 46:08.863
It's not like we can
just rewind this thing.

46:08.887 --> 46:11.169
This is it, man!

46:11.193 --> 46:13.389
It's not over.

46:13.413 --> 46:16.087
It won't be sound.

46:16.111 --> 46:20.135
But the proof is, at 200
hours, we'll get there...

46:20.159 --> 46:22.659
The lucidity point, the top
of the fucking mountain.

46:22.683 --> 46:24.313
They can't argue with that,

46:24.337 --> 46:26.794
no matter how sloppy
our method is.

46:26.818 --> 46:30.101
This is our only research.

46:30.125 --> 46:32.277
The only option is forward.

46:32.301 --> 46:34.391
With or without Frannie.

46:36.393 --> 46:40.111
You are not leaving, Frannie.

46:40.135 --> 46:42.094
You are not!

46:43.748 --> 46:46.185
I didn't even want
to do this shit.

46:47.404 --> 46:50.252
But you fuckers, you
talked me into it!

46:50.276 --> 46:51.601
I'm sorry, Dale.

46:51.625 --> 46:54.038
Oh, fuck your apology, Frannie!

46:54.062 --> 46:56.345
Come on!

46:56.369 --> 46:58.042
Come on.

46:58.066 --> 47:01.243
We can do this. You know
we can fucking do this.

47:03.202 --> 47:04.875
Goddamn it.

47:04.899 --> 47:07.032
If I leave right now, I
can still catch the bus.

47:14.343 --> 47:15.562
You want to keep going?

47:18.391 --> 47:20.262
I want to keep going.

47:21.525 --> 47:22.613
We're gonna keep going.

47:24.702 --> 47:30.447
The end results might be flawed,
but we're gonna finish this.

47:32.927 --> 47:38.367
Imperfect results are better
than fucking nothing!

47:59.650 --> 48:01.478
How do I look?

48:03.131 --> 48:04.611
It's weird.

48:06.265 --> 48:07.503
Weird how?

48:07.527 --> 48:09.287
I don't know. I can't
really interpret it.

48:09.311 --> 48:13.640
It's just not the brain activity
of a normal, alert person.

48:13.664 --> 48:15.163
It's more like the
brain activity of a...

48:15.187 --> 48:18.103
I don't know, someone
who's dreaming.

48:20.540 --> 48:22.910
Hmm. I don't know.

48:22.934 --> 48:25.347
I mean, maybe I could try some
electroconvulsive therapy

48:25.371 --> 48:26.435
to get you right, you know?

48:26.459 --> 48:27.654
I'll happily administer it.

48:27.678 --> 48:29.743
Shock therapy?

48:29.767 --> 48:31.832
Thanks, man, I'm good.

48:31.856 --> 48:34.748
So, Whatley...

48:34.772 --> 48:37.446
Bet you're doing her.

48:37.470 --> 48:39.013
Are you doing her?

48:39.037 --> 48:41.406
I bet she's a dom. Is she a dom?

48:41.430 --> 48:43.711
You're awfully perky for a
fucking asshole, you know that?

48:47.480 --> 48:49.763
What the fuck is this?

48:49.787 --> 48:51.895
It's the vitamins
Whatley gave me.

48:51.919 --> 48:54.202
I know they just gave me one.
I needed a little bit more.

48:54.226 --> 48:56.160
Man, I'm tired.

48:56.184 --> 48:59.381
No, Dale. The control serum
was in the second drawer.

48:59.405 --> 49:01.296
This is the first drawer.
It's the Cogniphan!

49:01.320 --> 49:03.017
- Shit.
- Fuck, man!

49:04.584 --> 49:07.171
God, first we lose Frannie,
now we've got no control?

49:07.195 --> 49:09.913
Fucking done. We're done!

49:09.937 --> 49:12.612
No. No, we can't stop now.
I need to keep going.

49:12.636 --> 49:16.441
Goddamn it! We need to know
if there's a lucidity point.

49:16.465 --> 49:19.183
This is our only shot.

49:19.207 --> 49:21.185
Hey, man, you got to keep
this between us, okay?

49:21.209 --> 49:23.013
Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

49:23.037 --> 49:24.928
I didn't even know that...

49:24.952 --> 49:27.235
Joe, what's that? Is that...?

49:27.259 --> 49:29.716
That's someone fucking
with us, right?

49:29.740 --> 49:31.916
- Right?
- Shut up. Shut up.

49:40.185 --> 49:41.490
Joe?

49:43.667 --> 49:45.732
It's trying to communicate.

49:45.756 --> 49:48.169
No. No.

49:48.193 --> 49:50.301
No, it's looking for us.

49:50.325 --> 49:52.739
It knows we're here.

49:52.763 --> 49:54.610
Yeah, but can't see us.

49:54.634 --> 49:55.611
Get the camera.

49:55.635 --> 49:58.377
- What?
- Get the camera.

50:05.602 --> 50:07.928
Where is it?

50:07.952 --> 50:09.799
I don't know.

50:09.823 --> 50:11.366
Where is it? I just saw...

50:11.390 --> 50:12.391
I can't see it.

50:26.971 --> 50:28.601
Where is it?

50:28.625 --> 50:31.366
Where is it?! I just saw it!

50:34.674 --> 50:35.893
Come on!

50:42.987 --> 50:44.292
Holly?

50:46.730 --> 50:48.316
Holly?

50:54.085 --> 50:56.280
Come on, Holly.

50:56.304 --> 50:58.282
Just relax, okay?

50:58.306 --> 50:59.786
It touched me.

51:01.745 --> 51:04.245
It was so cold.

51:04.269 --> 51:05.333
Okay.

51:05.357 --> 51:07.707
S-Show me.

51:14.583 --> 51:17.040
- Holly...
- Go get Whatley.

51:25.464 --> 51:27.007
I just want to sleep.

51:27.031 --> 51:29.357
I just want to sleep, I want
to sleep, I want to sleep.

51:29.381 --> 51:31.446
I want to sleep,
I want to sleep.

51:31.470 --> 51:33.254
I've just given you a sedative.

51:34.778 --> 51:36.669
You're gonna be all right.

51:36.693 --> 51:38.366
Okay?

51:38.390 --> 51:41.369
Good girl.

51:41.393 --> 51:42.873
Good girl.

51:50.445 --> 51:53.729
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

51:53.753 --> 51:56.079
And I'd appreciate it if you
didn't ask me that again.

51:56.103 --> 51:57.951
I'm sorry.

51:57.975 --> 52:01.084
It's just quite a lot
for me to process.

52:01.108 --> 52:04.044
What was it doing?

52:04.068 --> 52:05.634
I think it was looking for us.

52:08.681 --> 52:11.181
Joe.

52:11.205 --> 52:14.010
This sort of group
hysteria is not uncommon,

52:14.034 --> 52:16.404
especially in situations
of extreme stress.

52:16.428 --> 52:18.406
Hysteria didn't attack Holly.

52:18.430 --> 52:20.364
Hysteria didn't put
that mark on her arm.

52:20.388 --> 52:21.801
The tissue looked dead, Ella,

52:21.825 --> 52:24.412
like it just sucked
the life out of her.

52:24.436 --> 52:26.588
In extraordinary conditions,

52:26.612 --> 52:28.459
like the one you're
experiencing now,

52:28.483 --> 52:30.592
you know that the
mind can conjure up

52:30.616 --> 52:33.073
physiological changes
that are inexplicable.

52:33.097 --> 52:35.839
No. No, Ella.

52:37.057 --> 52:40.689
I... I don't know what I saw.

52:40.713 --> 52:42.889
But I know I saw something.

52:44.804 --> 52:45.849
She's not asleep yet.

52:47.067 --> 52:49.742
How much did you give her?

52:49.766 --> 52:51.158
Enough.

52:54.292 --> 52:56.773
She should be sleeping
like the dead right now.

54:56.718 --> 54:58.546
I'm tired, but I'm not.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.224
That's not terribly
scientific, I know,

55:04.248 --> 55:07.618
but it's important
that I document

55:07.642 --> 55:10.036
the effects of the Cogniphan
since I'm the only one left.

55:14.301 --> 55:15.539
I want to go to sleep,

55:15.563 --> 55:17.522
but I don't know if
that's just out of habit.

55:22.440 --> 55:26.096
Everything checks out.
I'm healthy.

55:27.619 --> 55:30.119
200 hours really
isn't all that long.

55:30.143 --> 55:32.774
By the time I get there,
I should be fully awake,

55:32.798 --> 55:36.256
like I've had a
full night's rest.

55:36.280 --> 55:37.934
I think it's working.

55:40.588 --> 55:43.026
Yeah, yeah, I fucked up.

55:44.810 --> 55:47.136
But Joe and I figured

55:47.160 --> 55:50.705
we might as well monitor
what's happening with me.

55:50.729 --> 55:53.751
Could be something useful.

55:53.775 --> 55:57.930
Hey, the greatest discoveries
happen by accident.

55:57.954 --> 55:59.129
Right?

56:09.269 --> 56:10.836
That thing...

56:12.446 --> 56:15.512
it circles us.

56:15.536 --> 56:19.821
It's like a shark, and it knows
there's blood in the water,

56:19.845 --> 56:22.587
but it can't quite find us.

56:24.676 --> 56:26.591
It's stalking us.

56:28.897 --> 56:32.399
The longer we stay awake,

56:32.423 --> 56:34.425
the closer it gets.

56:36.601 --> 56:40.059
And it's getting aggressive.

56:40.083 --> 56:43.845
Like it's desperate.

56:43.869 --> 56:45.566
Or hungry.

57:19.644 --> 57:22.449
Hey. Can you come
with me for a minute?

57:22.473 --> 57:24.103
Is everything okay?

57:24.127 --> 57:27.173
Yeah. Everything's fine.
It's fine.

57:47.019 --> 57:48.388
What the hell is that thing?

57:48.412 --> 57:51.434
A gauss meter.

57:51.458 --> 57:54.722
Gauss. It's a funny word.

57:56.159 --> 57:58.485
You want to tell me what
you're doing with it?

57:58.509 --> 58:01.009
Yeah, looking for
electromagnetic fields.

58:01.033 --> 58:03.359
Yeah, no shit, Dale. Why?

58:03.383 --> 58:07.146
Well, there's a
theory that ghosts

58:07.170 --> 58:09.974
either emit
electromagnetic energy

58:09.998 --> 58:14.327
or are just disruptions in
the electromagnetic fields.

58:14.351 --> 58:15.613
So you think we're haunted.

58:16.875 --> 58:18.137
Don't you?

58:21.097 --> 58:22.857
These aren't like any
ghosts I've ever seen.

58:22.881 --> 58:26.556
Yeah. That's because
you've never seen a ghost.

58:26.580 --> 58:29.168
Neither have I.

58:29.192 --> 58:31.474
In movies, I mean.

58:31.498 --> 58:33.215
Oh!

58:33.239 --> 58:36.523
Okay, so you're expecting like a...
like a white sheet, huh?

58:36.547 --> 58:38.133
And some rattling chains.

58:38.157 --> 58:40.962
Because that sure as shit
isn't what I'm seeing.

58:40.986 --> 58:43.162
What are you seeing?

58:44.163 --> 58:45.208
Me.

58:46.687 --> 58:50.580
Joe, I'm seeing me, as a kid.

58:50.604 --> 58:54.347
Seven years old, and I'm crying.

58:56.262 --> 58:59.459
That's what I hear, at first.

58:59.483 --> 59:02.070
And then I think I
see it, kind of,

59:02.094 --> 59:05.291
like moving around
in the shadows.

59:05.315 --> 59:08.709
You know? And, um, I'm, uh...

59:15.281 --> 59:18.217
It's like trying to find
shapes in clouds, you know?

59:18.241 --> 59:22.351
But instead of a dragon, it's...
it's me.

59:22.375 --> 59:24.527
And I'm crying.

59:24.551 --> 59:26.486
And I'm scared.

59:26.510 --> 59:29.010
And I'm hiding from my dad.

59:29.034 --> 59:31.732
Because he used to beat
the shit out of me.

59:34.953 --> 59:38.106
But here's the funny thing.

59:38.130 --> 59:41.457
When I look at it,

59:41.481 --> 59:44.919
like, directly, it's gone.

01:00:20.781 --> 01:00:22.087
Look!

01:01:18.491 --> 01:01:20.730
Shh. Shut up. Shut up!

01:01:20.754 --> 01:01:22.558
- Oh! It's going off like crazy.
- Shut up!

01:01:22.582 --> 01:01:26.388
Go. Open the door,
open the door.

01:01:26.412 --> 01:01:29.043
Open the door.

01:01:52.873 --> 01:01:54.547
No. Wait.

01:01:54.571 --> 01:01:56.897
- It's feeding.
- What?

01:01:56.921 --> 01:02:00.011
This is what it does.
It feeds on our dreams.

01:02:01.882 --> 01:02:06.080
Holy shit. It's a "somnivore."

01:02:13.546 --> 01:02:14.634
Ella!

01:02:15.418 --> 01:02:17.352
What? What is it?

01:02:24.427 --> 01:02:26.777
Dale! Where are you?!

01:02:30.128 --> 01:02:31.477
Little shit!

01:02:32.826 --> 01:02:34.306
Get down here!

01:02:34.654 --> 01:02:36.526
No! No!

01:02:39.877 --> 01:02:41.444
No!

01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:49.365
No!

01:03:10.168 --> 01:03:11.691
What are you doing?

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.279
Oh, shit!

01:03:15.303 --> 01:03:16.846
Holly, stop! Put the knife down!

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.718
Stop! Holly! Holly,
put down the knife!

01:03:18.742 --> 01:03:21.547
Aah! Aah!

01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:22.571
Aah!

01:03:34.932 --> 01:03:37.214
Holly? It's okay.

01:03:37.238 --> 01:03:39.478
Holly? Holly?

01:03:39.502 --> 01:03:42.481
You're awake. It's okay.

01:03:42.505 --> 01:03:43.873
Yeah, you are. You're fine.

01:03:43.897 --> 01:03:45.440
Dale?

01:03:45.464 --> 01:03:47.442
You there? Wake up.

01:03:47.466 --> 01:03:50.619
You're fine. You're fine.

01:03:50.643 --> 01:03:51.992
You're fine.

01:04:01.306 --> 01:04:07.157
She needs a doctor. I'm going
to take her to the ER.

01:04:07.181 --> 01:04:10.683
It's over, guys. We are done.

01:04:10.707 --> 01:04:13.860
What are you gonna tell
them at the hospital, huh?

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:14.991
"Yes, Doctor."

01:04:15.015 --> 01:04:16.645
My friend hasn't been sleeping

01:04:16.669 --> 01:04:19.039
and the monster that
I call Somnivore

01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:20.954
"can't eat her dreams, so it's
draining her fucking soul."

01:04:20.978 --> 01:04:22.259
Is that what you're
gonna tell them?

01:04:22.283 --> 01:04:24.218
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:04:24.242 --> 01:04:26.263
Fuck you, Joe.

01:04:26.287 --> 01:04:28.899
Tell her how I fucked
up everything.

01:04:32.598 --> 01:04:34.600
What's he talking about, Joe?

01:04:36.167 --> 01:04:38.450
It's over.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.103
We have no controlled variable.

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:42.062
Dale accidentally
took the Cogniphan.

01:04:42.086 --> 01:04:44.368
What?

01:04:44.392 --> 01:04:46.240
When were you
planning to tell me?!

01:04:46.264 --> 01:04:48.677
Afterwards.

01:04:48.701 --> 01:04:50.200
I thought if I hit lucidity,

01:04:50.224 --> 01:04:51.506
that's all the proof
we would need.

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:52.749
I'm sorry.

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:16.270
- Hello?
- Hey.

01:05:16.294 --> 01:05:18.098
Did you... Did you hear it?

01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:19.839
- No, not...
- Joe, can hear it right now?

01:05:19.863 --> 01:05:21.580
Listen, Frannie, I
need your help.

01:05:21.604 --> 01:05:24.365
Joe, I can't quit shaking.

01:05:24.389 --> 01:05:26.846
I thought if I came here,
then it would leave me alone,

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:28.543
but it followed me here.

01:05:28.567 --> 01:05:32.155
Frannie, please. Come back.

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:33.679
Holly...

01:05:33.703 --> 01:05:35.985
It's bad.

01:05:36.009 --> 01:05:38.292
Just come back and help me
figure this out, please?

01:05:38.316 --> 01:05:40.207
Okay.

01:05:40.231 --> 01:05:43.210
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:05:43.234 --> 01:05:44.583
Oh, a-and, Joe?

01:05:46.324 --> 01:05:48.544
Don't trust Whatley.

01:06:03.036 --> 01:06:06.146
I'm feeling better now, Dale.

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.693
Good.

01:06:09.086 --> 01:06:12.152
Good. That's good.

01:06:12.176 --> 01:06:14.023
I need you.

01:06:14.047 --> 01:06:16.417
Okay.

01:06:16.441 --> 01:06:18.138
I need you too.

01:06:22.882 --> 01:06:25.469
I need you to cut me.

01:06:25.493 --> 01:06:27.515
What?

01:06:27.539 --> 01:06:29.082
I can't.

01:06:29.106 --> 01:06:30.605
I can't do that.

01:06:30.629 --> 01:06:33.652
No, I... I need you to cut me.

01:06:33.676 --> 01:06:36.480
Don't you want me
to feel better?

01:06:36.504 --> 01:06:39.527
Don't... Don't you
want me to feel good?

01:06:39.551 --> 01:06:42.008
Don't you care about me?

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:43.966
- Please.
- I can't.

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:46.534
- Please, please cut me, please.
- I can't.

01:06:46.558 --> 01:06:49.015
- Please, come on. Please, Dale.
- Please, don't talk like this.

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:52.061
Dale, please, fu...
Fucking cut me, please!

01:06:52.085 --> 01:06:54.324
Please!

01:06:54.348 --> 01:06:57.177
Please. Please.

01:07:28.905 --> 01:07:30.752
Joe! Joe!

01:07:30.776 --> 01:07:32.972
Joe, let me in! I forgot my key!

01:07:32.996 --> 01:07:36.279
Hurry! Hurry! Please! Hurry!

01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:38.218
- Joe!
- Come on!

01:07:42.745 --> 01:07:45.269
- You okay?
- There's more than one.

01:07:54.931 --> 01:07:56.952
Dale and I saw one.

01:07:56.976 --> 01:07:59.413
It was feeding on Whatley
while she slept.

01:08:00.632 --> 01:08:02.828
That's why they're after us.

01:08:02.852 --> 01:08:04.505
They're hungry.

01:08:05.768 --> 01:08:08.771
They're hungry, and we're
not feeding them anymore.

01:08:10.773 --> 01:08:13.708
We're not dreaming, so
they're coming after

01:08:13.732 --> 01:08:18.365
the next-best thing... us.

01:08:18.389 --> 01:08:19.801
We've opened our minds to them.

01:08:19.825 --> 01:08:21.673
Yeah. With the Cogniphan.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:24.066
Yeah.

01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:26.808
It's like they've
always been here,

01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:29.071
around us, around
humanity all along.

01:08:29.095 --> 01:08:32.466
We didn't find them.
They found us.

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:34.511
Let's say they're
feeding on our dreams.

01:08:34.535 --> 01:08:36.948
It's a symbiotic relationship.

01:08:36.973 --> 01:08:38.777
Humanity has evolved
along with them,

01:08:38.801 --> 01:08:41.170
but now with the Cogniphan,

01:08:41.194 --> 01:08:44.260
we're pushing human evolution
past the need for sleep.

01:08:44.283 --> 01:08:48.569
It's like we're in a
liminal state right now,

01:08:48.593 --> 01:08:51.703
not quite sleeping but not
quite free of it, either.

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:53.835
We're a walking dream to them.

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:55.968
But once we hit 200 hours,

01:08:55.992 --> 01:08:58.361
our brains are completely
rewired from the ground up.

01:08:58.385 --> 01:09:02.017
Their food source will
be completely gone.

01:09:02.041 --> 01:09:03.801
Maybe they won't be
able to find us.

01:09:03.826 --> 01:09:07.220
Okay. That is a lot of maybes.

01:09:08.308 --> 01:09:10.591
Why Holly?

01:09:10.615 --> 01:09:12.419
What do you mean?

01:09:12.443 --> 01:09:15.011
Why have they gotten
to her but not to us?

01:09:17.535 --> 01:09:20.383
You remember Rob Paddit
from our biology class?

01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:22.821
He needed three hours of
sleep, and he was fine.

01:09:22.845 --> 01:09:25.953
Me? I need eight hours or I
can't even dress myself.

01:09:25.978 --> 01:09:27.826
Everybody's different.

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:30.698
Some people live closer
to the threshold.

01:09:30.721 --> 01:09:34.180
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:38.358
Dr. Becker, the professor that
collaborated with Whatley

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:40.707
during the rhesus monkey trials?

01:09:40.732 --> 01:09:43.363
He died three years ago.

01:09:43.386 --> 01:09:46.366
There's no way he could've
signed off on that study.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:49.890
Joe, there's something
she's not telling us.

01:09:49.915 --> 01:09:54.113
Oh, my God. Loser.

01:09:59.403 --> 01:10:03.296
You're so gross! And pathetic!

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.863
Cut me again.

01:10:04.887 --> 01:10:07.126
Cut me again, cut me again.
Please, Dale, please.

01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:09.041
- I can't.
- It feels good, it feels good.

01:10:09.065 --> 01:10:11.957
I can't. I can't do any more.

01:10:11.981 --> 01:10:15.787
I need you to cut me again.
Cut me again.

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:19.640
Undo the strap. I'll help you,
I'll help you, I'll help you.

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:22.968
I'll help you. Please. I... I...

01:10:22.992 --> 01:10:25.622
I-I need you to cut me again.

01:10:25.646 --> 01:10:29.104
Okay. It's okay.

01:10:29.128 --> 01:10:30.845
We're gonna go home.

01:10:30.869 --> 01:10:32.804
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.718
We're going home.

01:10:34.742 --> 01:10:37.417
You are so disgusting!

01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:39.288
No. No. I don't want...

01:10:39.312 --> 01:10:41.987
No. No, no. We
can't go any more.

01:10:42.011 --> 01:10:44.511
If we go any deeper, we'll cut
your femoral artery. You'll die.

01:10:44.535 --> 01:10:47.079
I don't want to... I
don't want to do this.

01:10:47.103 --> 01:10:48.950
I don't want to do this.

01:10:48.974 --> 01:10:50.343
Aah!

01:10:50.367 --> 01:10:53.172
Piece-of-shit loser.

01:10:53.196 --> 01:10:56.001
I'll cut myself too. Ohh!

01:10:56.025 --> 01:10:58.612
No! No.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.030
No.

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:04.772
It's quiet.

01:11:07.036 --> 01:11:08.927
I'm going to sleep now.

01:11:08.951 --> 01:11:12.345
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:16.001
Oh, fuck.

01:11:17.002 --> 01:11:18.656
God.

01:11:58.783 --> 01:12:01.264
Here. Here it is.

01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:08.010
Oh, yeah.

01:12:09.881 --> 01:12:10.989
- There it is.
- Yeah.

01:12:11.013 --> 01:12:12.275
This is it.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.298
And that's Dr. Becker's
signature.

01:12:16.322 --> 01:12:17.976
After the day he died.

01:12:19.586 --> 01:12:22.522
What are you doing?

01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:24.828
- You lied.
- About what?

01:12:24.852 --> 01:12:26.787
About the simian tests.

01:12:26.811 --> 01:12:30.336
About Dr. Becker. You
forged his signature.

01:12:31.424 --> 01:12:34.055
And? You would've done the same.

01:12:34.079 --> 01:12:36.405
Maybe.

01:12:36.429 --> 01:12:39.147
It would've been nice to
have a fucking choice.

01:12:39.171 --> 01:12:41.454
Going straight from
rats to humans?

01:12:41.478 --> 01:12:43.151
You've got to be kidding me.

01:12:43.175 --> 01:12:44.544
They shot us down at every turn.

01:12:44.568 --> 01:12:46.502
The primate lab just
wouldn't cooperate.

01:12:46.526 --> 01:12:48.069
They wouldn't budge.

01:12:48.093 --> 01:12:50.202
So you did it anyway.

01:12:50.226 --> 01:12:53.379
You went forward anyway and
showed us falsified results.

01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:55.990
Had I confessed before we
started all of this...

01:12:56.014 --> 01:12:58.123
Which was your idea,
by the way...

01:12:58.147 --> 01:12:59.863
No one would've
gone along with it.

01:12:59.887 --> 01:13:01.387
Yeah, you're goddamn
right we wouldn't have!

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:03.780
It was our decision to make!

01:13:03.804 --> 01:13:05.478
You're putting our
lives at risk here!

01:13:05.502 --> 01:13:07.610
You're fucking putting
our lives at risk!

01:13:07.634 --> 01:13:09.873
I just knew how much this
meant to all of you...

01:13:09.897 --> 01:13:11.136
Don't bullshit me!

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.746
Don't play kindly
benefactor now.

01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:14.487
Are you done?

01:13:14.511 --> 01:13:16.010
Hardly.

01:13:16.034 --> 01:13:17.664
Well, I am.

01:13:17.688 --> 01:13:19.709
I'm pulling the plug
on all of this.

01:13:19.733 --> 01:13:20.733
This is over.

01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:28.022
Did she just break up with you,
or did she stop the experiment?

01:13:28.046 --> 01:13:30.222
I'm pretty sure that was both.

01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:17.182
Dale?

01:14:19.228 --> 01:14:21.230
Dale, are you all right?

01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:28.976
Dale?

01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:41.206
Are you okay? I need
you to talk to me.

01:14:56.395 --> 01:14:58.093
Dale?

01:15:27.905 --> 01:15:30.318
Aah!

01:15:30.342 --> 01:15:31.189
Jesus.

01:15:31.213 --> 01:15:34.801
I'm so sorry!

01:15:34.825 --> 01:15:36.629
I'm so sorry.

01:15:36.653 --> 01:15:38.674
Jesus! Fuck.

01:15:38.698 --> 01:15:40.937
Oh, my God!

01:15:40.961 --> 01:15:42.591
You fuck!

01:15:42.615 --> 01:15:44.376
You fucker!

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.855
No! Stop!

01:15:45.879 --> 01:15:47.683
No!

01:15:47.707 --> 01:15:51.557
Joe, stop it! Stop it, stop it!

01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:53.689
No!

01:15:53.713 --> 01:15:55.909
Stop it! Stop it!

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:02.418
I'm sorry.

01:16:03.636 --> 01:16:06.180
I'm so sorry!

01:16:06.204 --> 01:16:09.052
I thought she was...!

01:16:09.076 --> 01:16:11.620
It was all in my head.

01:16:11.644 --> 01:16:14.232
It was all in my head!

01:16:44.068 --> 01:16:46.786
What are we gonna do?

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:49.856
I mean, they're dead. I mean,
should we call the cops?

01:16:51.815 --> 01:16:53.655
If we call the police,
we're all dead, Frannie.

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.646
How long until lucidity?

01:17:02.304 --> 01:17:04.934
About two hours for me, maybe.

01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:09.548
You missed treatments, so I
don't know how long for you.

01:17:09.572 --> 01:17:12.290
Your body's metabolized a
good 60% of it by now.

01:17:12.314 --> 01:17:15.075
It's irrelevant. We
need to sleep, Frannie.

01:17:15.099 --> 01:17:17.077
Wait. Wait, wait.

01:17:17.101 --> 01:17:18.296
That didn't work for Holly.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.732
Why do you think it
would work for us?

01:17:19.756 --> 01:17:23.866
I gave Holly a sedative.
This is surgical anesthetic.

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.675
Oh.

01:17:26.937 --> 01:17:27.937
Oh, okay.

01:17:31.985 --> 01:17:34.312
So...

01:17:34.336 --> 01:17:37.576
We're just gonna leave them
there, Ella and Holly?

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.840
No. No, no, I'll
think of something.

01:17:40.864 --> 01:17:43.582
But until then, they're
just gonna lie there.

01:17:43.606 --> 01:17:44.974
We need to sleep, Frannie.

01:17:44.998 --> 01:17:46.846
Then we'll talk, we'll
figure everything out.

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:49.327
But we need to protect
ourselves first, all right?

01:17:49.351 --> 01:17:52.460
- All right?
- Okay.

01:17:52.484 --> 01:17:54.375
Hey, I'm gonna count to 10.

01:17:54.399 --> 01:17:58.118
No, I mean, I'm gonna count down from...
from... from 10 to zero.

01:17:58.142 --> 01:17:59.946
I probably shouldn't
even make it to zero.

01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:02.644
I mean, this is good stuff.
I'm just gonna fall asleep.

01:18:02.668 --> 01:18:05.821
Don't worry about me. Just
don't want to roll my vein.

01:18:05.845 --> 01:18:07.562
And, um, don't forgot
to do all the things

01:18:07.586 --> 01:18:10.652
that you're supposed to do when
you give someone an injection.

01:18:10.676 --> 01:18:12.306
You know, and don't
give me an embolism.

01:18:12.330 --> 01:18:14.352
It's a really
horrible way to die.

01:18:14.376 --> 01:18:16.702
You're giving me 20 cc's, right?

01:18:16.726 --> 01:18:18.312
That's how much
you're giving me,

01:18:18.336 --> 01:18:21.731
so I should be able to go
to sleep for a couple days.

01:18:27.824 --> 01:18:29.391
You already did it.

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:36.398
Backwards from 10, Frannie.

01:18:37.834 --> 01:18:39.986
Okay.

01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:41.944
10...

01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:45.450
Joe, I'm... I'm really sorry
about what happened to Ella.

01:18:50.586 --> 01:18:54.566
Nine, eight,

01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:58.831
seven, six,

01:18:58.855 --> 01:19:03.052
five, four,

01:19:03.076 --> 01:19:08.473
three, two, one.

01:20:13.495 --> 01:20:15.342
I'm...

01:20:15.366 --> 01:20:17.499
I'm not afraid of you.

01:20:24.767 --> 01:20:27.291
You can't hurt me.

01:20:30.163 --> 01:20:32.078
This is only a dream.

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.623
And you can't hurt me.

01:21:11.857 --> 01:21:13.555
It didn't work.

01:21:17.167 --> 01:21:19.212
I know.

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.844
20 cc's.

01:21:22.868 --> 01:21:24.629
No, I gave us 40 each.

01:21:24.653 --> 01:21:27.240
What? You shouldn't
have done that.

01:21:27.264 --> 01:21:30.528
- You could've stopped my heart.
- Would it have mattered?

01:21:45.891 --> 01:21:48.415
Wait. Wait, I have an idea.

01:21:59.862 --> 01:22:01.448
This won't work.

01:22:01.472 --> 01:22:03.711
Joe, I need you to believe this,

01:22:03.735 --> 01:22:06.279
'cause if you don't,
then I can't...

01:22:06.303 --> 01:22:09.238
I just... I can't.

01:22:09.262 --> 01:22:10.631
You're just
hypnotizing yourself?

01:22:10.655 --> 01:22:12.067
Yeah, essentially.

01:22:12.091 --> 01:22:13.373
I was part of this group
that was doing this

01:22:13.397 --> 01:22:14.853
a few semesters ago.

01:22:14.877 --> 01:22:16.507
The idea is that when your
brain is in a waking state,

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:17.769
those are beta waves.

01:22:17.793 --> 01:22:19.858
When it is in REM
sleep, those are delta.

01:22:19.882 --> 01:22:23.601
So I may not be able
to fall asleep,

01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:26.342
but maybe I can trick my brain.

01:22:26.366 --> 01:22:27.953
And hopefully them.

01:22:27.977 --> 01:22:29.650
Any other choice if
this doesn't work?

01:22:29.674 --> 01:22:33.219
Electroconvulsive therapy
can alter brain waves.

01:22:33.243 --> 01:22:35.874
I am not putting that shit
to your head, Frannie!

01:22:35.898 --> 01:22:38.050
- It'll kill you.
- Okay, then do this with me!

01:22:38.074 --> 01:22:39.486
I'm close, Frannie.

01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:40.966
I haven't missed a dose.
You have.

01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:42.620
If I quit now and
this doesn't work...

01:22:42.644 --> 01:22:45.057
No, it's going to work!

01:22:45.081 --> 01:22:46.212
Hey, I believe you.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:52.238
If this doesn't, then we can
try a warm glass of milk

01:22:52.262 --> 01:22:54.327
and a bedtime story.

01:22:54.351 --> 01:22:56.092
Deal.

01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:06.687
Hello,

01:23:06.711 --> 01:23:11.126
and welcome to tape one of
the Myers Hypnosis Program.

01:23:11.150 --> 01:23:14.565
Let's start by taking
a few deep breaths.

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:17.524
Focus on that breath.

01:23:17.548 --> 01:23:21.659
In through your nostrils,
out through your mouth.

01:23:21.683 --> 01:23:26.054
In slowly and out slowly.

01:23:26.078 --> 01:23:29.275
Let your mind begin to float.

01:23:29.299 --> 01:23:32.060
My voice will drift away.

01:23:32.084 --> 01:23:35.218
Look deep into the
shadows of your mind...

01:23:43.356 --> 01:23:47.467
as your consciousness...

01:23:47.491 --> 01:23:49.600
Clear your head
and stay focused.

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:50.973
Breathe.

01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:55.194
Breathe.

01:23:56.543 --> 01:23:59.479
Focus on your breath.

01:23:59.503 --> 01:24:01.524
In through your nostrils,

01:24:01.548 --> 01:24:03.788
out through your mouth.

01:24:03.812 --> 01:24:06.791
- Joe?
- Listen to the voice.

01:24:06.815 --> 01:24:08.338
Breathe.

01:24:14.779 --> 01:24:17.018
Holy shit.

01:24:17.042 --> 01:24:20.152
Frannie. Frannie, we can
beat this, Frannie.

01:24:20.176 --> 01:24:24.069
Frannie, listen to me, please.

01:24:24.093 --> 01:24:26.071
Frannie, don't do this.

01:24:26.095 --> 01:24:28.073
Frannie.

01:24:28.097 --> 01:24:30.553
I'm sorry, Joe.

01:24:30.577 --> 01:24:32.468
It wasn't working.

01:24:33.668 --> 01:24:35.558
Frannie!

01:24:35.582 --> 01:24:36.777
Shit.

01:24:36.801 --> 01:24:39.195
Oh, shit.

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:04.457
I think it worked.

01:25:04.481 --> 01:25:06.918
Frannie? Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.957
Aah! Dale, we've got to go!

01:25:25.981 --> 01:25:27.983
We've got to get the
fuck out of here!

01:25:43.999 --> 01:25:45.063
Joseph.

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:02.384
Joseph.

01:26:02.408 --> 01:26:04.759
Joseph.

01:26:55.592 --> 01:26:58.571
Okay, Mr. Slater.

01:26:58.595 --> 01:27:01.206
I'll be back next week to
see if you need anything.

01:27:04.514 --> 01:27:06.318
They're in here.

01:27:06.342 --> 01:27:08.581
They're in here right now.

01:27:08.605 --> 01:27:11.453
There's nothing here, Joe.

01:27:11.477 --> 01:27:13.958
Try and get some rest, okay?

01:27:20.182 --> 01:27:22.551
- How is he?
- The same.

01:27:22.575 --> 01:27:25.056
He never sleeps. He
just screams all night.

01:27:27.537 --> 01:27:30.757
You know, after a lobotomy,
people don't ever fully recover.

01:27:32.107 --> 01:27:34.283
Okay. Thank you.
