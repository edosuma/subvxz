- Hello, Sam.
- Hiya, Marty.

01:39.281 --> 01:41.784
Your kid brother got married Sunday,
huh, Marty?

01:41.909 --> 01:44.620
That's right, Mrs Fusari.
It was a very nice affair.

01:44.745 --> 01:48.833
- The tall fella with the moustache?
- No. No, that's my other brother Freddie.

01:48.958 --> 01:52.712
Freddie got married about four years ago.
He lives on Webb Avenue.

01:52.838 --> 01:55.298
No, the one who got married
Sunday is Nicky.

01:55.423 --> 01:58.969
I thought he was a big, fat fella.
Don't I meet him here one time?

01:59.095 --> 02:01.639
A big, tall, fat fella,
tried to sell me insurance.

02:01.764 --> 02:04.850
Oh, no, that's my sister
Margaret's husband Frank.

02:04.975 --> 02:07.437
Margaret married the insurance salesman.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.898
And my sister Rose
married the contractor.

02:10.023 --> 02:11.941
They moved to Detroit last year.

02:12.067 --> 02:14.944
My other sister Frances,
she got married two years ago

02:15.069 --> 02:17.406
in St John's Church
on Kingsbridge Avenue.

02:17.531 --> 02:19.782
Oh, that was a very nice affair.

02:20.325 --> 02:25.872
Well, let's see now. That'll be $1.79.
How's that with you, Mrs Fusari?

02:25.997 --> 02:27.916
Well...

02:28.041 --> 02:31.295
- Hey, Marty, I'm in a hurry!
- You're next right now, Mrs Canduso.

02:31.420 --> 02:35.132
When you gonna get married, Marty?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

02:35.257 --> 02:39.929
All your brothers and sisters younger than
you. They get married, they got children.

02:40.054 --> 02:45.727
I meet your mother. She say to me "Hey,
you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?"

02:45.852 --> 02:49.397
What's the matter with you? That's
no way. What's the matter with you?

02:49.522 --> 02:51.858
- Mrs Fusari...
- You get married, you hear?

02:51.984 --> 02:55.945
- Mrs Fusari, Mrs Canduso's in a...
- My boy Frank was 19 when he married.

02:56.070 --> 02:58.032
- What's the matter?
- That's swell.

02:58.157 --> 03:00.950
You should be ashamed of yourself!

03:01.076 --> 03:04.829
- Marty, I want a pullet, about four pounds.
- Sure.

03:04.956 --> 03:09.585
- I hear your kid brother got married.
- That's right. It was a very nice affair.

03:09.710 --> 03:12.296
Marty, you oughta be
ashamed of yourself.

03:12.630 --> 03:15.884
All your kid brothers and sisters
married and got children.

03:16.009 --> 03:18.469
When are you gonna get married?

03:28.856 --> 03:32.901
The Giants are gonna wind up
in the cellar! In the cellar!

03:34.320 --> 03:36.822
Hey, Lou, turn on the Dodger game.

03:39.241 --> 03:42.036
- What happened?
- Yanks won both. They murdered 'em!

03:42.161 --> 03:44.621
Any homers? Whoo!

03:46.749 --> 03:50.503
So anyway, Leo and me, we're sittin'

03:50.628 --> 03:53.172
- Angie come in yet?
- So they come to the bar...

03:53.298 --> 03:55.967
- Hey, Ange, you want a beer?
- Yeah, I guess so.

03:56.092 --> 03:59.471
- So I look over at the one next to me...
- Hey, Lou.

03:59.596 --> 04:01.097
- Hiya, Marty.
- Hiya, Ralph.

04:01.222 --> 04:04.810
I'm tellin' these guys about two nurses
Leo and me picked up in a joint.

04:04.935 --> 04:08.939
- Hey, Lou, let me have two beers.
- So let me tell ya about these two nurses.

04:09.064 --> 04:11.024
- Man, oh, man!
- How about that, huh?

04:11.150 --> 04:13.610
- What you readin', Joe?
- Lou, turn the set off!

04:13.735 --> 04:18.574
- They shouldn't sell magazines like this.
- Imagine the effect it has on adolescents.

04:18.699 --> 04:20.535
Now, that's something, huh?

04:20.660 --> 04:23.580
- I went out with a girl like that.
- You should live so long!

04:23.705 --> 04:26.374
Hey, Richie, the Yankees took two today.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.126
Hey, Marty.

04:28.251 --> 04:32.839
Hey, Marty, Leo and me, we got a date
with these two nurses tonight, you know?

04:32.964 --> 04:36.177
So we gotta take 'em somewheres first,
you know what I mean?

04:36.302 --> 04:40.514
So I'm hard up for cash right now and I...

04:40.639 --> 04:42.933
I owe you ten bucks already, don't I?

04:43.851 --> 04:45.895
I'll find it somewhere else.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.980
Hey. Hey, Richie.

04:48.105 --> 04:51.400
That Ralph, boy,
he's always got girls but no money.

05:02.203 --> 05:03.622
- See ya, Ralph.
- See ya, Joe.

05:03.747 --> 05:06.208
So, what do you feel like doin' tonight?

05:07.792 --> 05:10.796
I don't know, Ange.
What do you feel like doin'?

05:11.880 --> 05:15.175
Well, we oughta do somethin'.
It's Saturday night.

05:15.300 --> 05:18.136
I don't wanna go bowlin'
like last Saturday.

05:20.723 --> 05:25.060
Hey, how about callin' up that big girl
we picked up in the movies a month ago

05:25.185 --> 05:27.647
up in the RKO Chester?

05:27.772 --> 05:30.983
- Which one was that?
- That big girl that was in front of us

05:31.108 --> 05:34.403
- with the skinny friend.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:34.529 --> 05:38.950
Her name was Mary Feeney. We took 'em
home all the way out in Brooklyn.

05:39.076 --> 05:42.830
What do you say? Think we oughta
give 'em a call? I'll take the skinny one.

05:42.955 --> 05:46.750
- She maybe got a date already, Ange.
- What can we lose?

05:46.875 --> 05:50.379
I didn't like her.
I don't feel like callin' her up.

05:51.463 --> 05:53.758
Well, what do you feel like doin' tonight?

05:53.883 --> 05:57.344
I don't know, Ange.
What do you feel like doin'?

05:57.469 --> 06:01.766
We're back to that, huh? I say
"What do you feel like doin' tonight?"

06:01.891 --> 06:04.852
You say back to me "I don't know.
What do you feel like doin'?"

06:04.977 --> 06:09.733
Then we wind up sittin' around your
house with a couple of cans of beer.

06:11.443 --> 06:13.904
I'll tell you what I feel like doin'.

06:14.654 --> 06:17.615
I feel like callin' up this here Mary Feeney.

06:18.617 --> 06:20.994
She likes you.

06:21.119 --> 06:23.079
What makes you say that?

06:23.204 --> 06:26.333
- Man, I could see she likes ya.
- Yeah, sure.

06:26.458 --> 06:30.087
- Call her up.
- You call her up yourself. I don't want to.

06:32.924 --> 06:35.635
Well, how about goin' down 72nd Street?

06:37.178 --> 06:39.639
See what we can find down there?

06:40.890 --> 06:45.812
Ralph says you gotta beat 'em off with
clubs. Boy, you're gettin' to be a real drag!

06:45.937 --> 06:48.482
I been lookin' for a girl
every Saturday night.

06:48.607 --> 06:51.151
I'm 34. I'm just tired of lookin', that's all!

06:51.276 --> 06:54.864
I'd like to find a girl!
Everybody's tellin' me "Get married."

06:54.989 --> 06:59.451
Don't you think I wanna get married?
I want to. Everybody drives me crazy.

06:59.619 --> 07:04.790
I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night.
You go somewhere. I don't wanna go.

07:04.915 --> 07:09.128
Boy, my old lady, too. Every word out of
her mouth: "When you gettin' married?"

07:09.253 --> 07:11.964
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.

07:20.682 --> 07:22.517
So...

07:23.810 --> 07:26.896
What do you feel like doin' tonight?

07:29.024 --> 07:31.068
I don't know, Ange.

07:32.820 --> 07:36.114
- What do you feel like doin'?
- Hello. Yeah, he's here.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.493
- Marty, your mother's on the phone.
- My mother?

07:39.618 --> 07:42.038
He's comin' now, Mrs Piletti.

07:42.163 --> 07:46.334
- Hey, Marty. I'm goin' home.
- Listen, Ange, come on over about 7.30.

07:46.459 --> 07:50.339
We'll think of somethin'.
Hello, Ma. What's the matter?

07:50.464 --> 07:56.344
Your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia,
they're here and waitin' to see you.

07:56.469 --> 07:58.681
OK, Ma. I'll be home in two minutes.

07:58.806 --> 08:01.933
Listen, Ma, tell Thomas to stick around.
I wanna see him.

08:02.934 --> 08:06.021
OK. You come on home, huh? OK.

08:10.109 --> 08:11.527
Marty's coming home.

08:11.652 --> 08:15.906
So what happened about this milk bottle
was, my mother-in-law is in the kitchen,

08:16.031 --> 08:19.452
she begins pokin' her head
over my shoulder here and there.

08:19.578 --> 08:24.624
Then she tells me how I waste money, I
can't cook and I'm raisin' my baby wrong.

08:24.749 --> 08:27.502
She got me so nervous
I spilled the milk for the baby.

08:27.627 --> 08:29.796
Tommy, your mother is my sister, but...

08:29.922 --> 08:34.927
So she says "You're spillin' the milk."
She kept talkin' about these drops of milk.

08:35.052 --> 08:39.765
Finally she got me so mad I said "Mama,
you wanna see me really spill milk?"

08:39.890 --> 08:42.518
So I picked up the bottle
and I threw it at the door.

08:42.643 --> 08:45.563
I didn't throw it at her.
That's something she made up.

08:45.688 --> 08:48.358
She tells everybody
I threw a bottle of milk at her.

08:48.483 --> 08:50.777
I didn't throw it anywheres near her.

08:50.902 --> 08:54.072
Anyway, I was sorry,
but she ran out of the house and I...

08:54.197 --> 08:59.786
I don't know what you want me to do, but,
if you want me to, I come and talk to her.

09:00.245 --> 09:02.956
- Well, Aunt Theresa, we...
- Let me tell it, Tommy.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.209
OK.

09:05.334 --> 09:08.838
Aunt Theresa, we want you
to do a very big favour for us.

09:08.963 --> 09:10.172
Sure.

09:10.297 --> 09:12.508
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here.

09:12.633 --> 09:15.344
You got this big house
just for you and Marty.

09:15.469 --> 09:18.765
I thought Tommy's mother
could come and live with you and Marty.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.892
- Well...
- I talked to Tommy's brother

09:21.017 --> 09:26.397
and I said "You gotta take her for
a couple of years!" And he says "Oh, no!"

09:26.522 --> 09:29.901
- I sound terrible...
- No, Virginia. I know how you feel.

09:30.026 --> 09:34.405
I just can't stand it any more! Every
minute of the day! Do this! Do that!

09:34.532 --> 09:38.536
I don't have ten minutes privacy with
my husband. We can't even have a fight.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.704
We don't have any privacy!

09:40.829 --> 09:44.583
- All right, Ginnie. Don't get so excited.
- She's right, Tommy.

09:44.708 --> 09:47.461
A young husband and wife
should have their own home.

09:47.837 --> 09:53.593
And my sister Caterina, well... she's my
sister, but I must say she's an old goat.

09:53.718 --> 09:58.139
And plenty of time in my life I feel like
throw the milk bottle at her myself.

09:58.264 --> 10:04.229
But I tell you right now, if Caterina wants
to come and live here with Marty and me,

10:04.354 --> 10:06.607
it's all right with me.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.860
That's very nice of you, Aunt Theresa.

10:09.985 --> 10:13.071
- Of course, we gotta ask Marty first.
- Sure, sure.

10:13.196 --> 10:16.868
Sit here. I go in the kitchen
and turn a little fire under the cooking.

10:16.993 --> 10:19.370
That's very nice of you, Aunt Theresa.

10:26.711 --> 10:29.297
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?

10:29.422 --> 10:34.468
Oh, he's fine.
You know a nice girl he can marry?

10:34.595 --> 10:36.764
Oh, don't worry. He'll get married.

10:36.889 --> 10:40.809
I don't know.
He sits around the house all the time.

10:41.810 --> 10:44.939
You know a nice place
where he can go to get a bride?

10:47.024 --> 10:50.110
There's the Stardust Ballroom.
That's a big dance hall.

10:50.235 --> 10:53.739
Every Saturday night
it's loaded with girls. It's a nice place.

10:53.864 --> 10:58.161
You pay 77 cents. Well, it used to be 77
cents. Probably a dollar and a half now.

10:58.286 --> 11:00.455
You go in and ask some girl to dance.

11:00.580 --> 11:03.291
It's a respectable...
That's where I met Virginia.

11:03.416 --> 11:07.713
You tell Marty to go to the Stardust
Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.

11:08.046 --> 11:12.009
"The Stardust Ballroom.
It's loaded with tomatoes."

11:12.134 --> 11:12.843
Right.

11:12.968 --> 11:17.056
Aunt Theresa, this is so nice of you.
I want you to know we appreciate it.

11:19.141 --> 11:21.185
He's here.

11:25.565 --> 11:27.609
- Hello, Marty.
- Hello, Ma.

11:28.609 --> 11:30.695
Thomas and Virginia are here.

11:30.820 --> 11:34.074
They just had another big fight
with your Aunt Caterina,

11:34.199 --> 11:36.993
so they ask me if it's OK
Caterina come live here.

11:37.118 --> 11:40.497
I said all right with me,
but we gotta ask you.

11:40.622 --> 11:44.209
Marty, she's a lonely old woman.
Nobody wants her.

11:44.334 --> 11:47.755
Everybody's throwing her out they house.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.759
- Well, sure, Ma. It's OK with me.
- You got a good heart.

11:54.636 --> 11:59.266
- Marty say it's all right she come here.
- Thanks. Takes a load off of my mind.

11:59.391 --> 12:02.937
- We got plenty of room here.
- Oh, it's gonna be nice.

12:03.062 --> 12:07.317
I come over tonight, I talk to Caterina.
Everything is gonna work out all right.

12:07.442 --> 12:10.319
I wanna thank you
because it was becoming impossible.

12:10.444 --> 12:12.280
Sit down, Thomas. Sit down.

12:12.405 --> 12:16.117
Marty, I appreciate what you
and your mother are doing because...

12:16.242 --> 12:18.912
- Oh.
- No, listen. What was happening...

12:19.037 --> 12:21.581
Virginia was makin' milk and my mother...

12:21.706 --> 12:24.293
- I promised the baby-sitter six o'clock.
- OK.

12:24.418 --> 12:28.255
- Before you go, I need some advice.
- Sure. What?

12:28.380 --> 12:33.344
Well, you're the accountant in the family.
My boss wants to sell his shop to me.

12:33.469 --> 12:36.431
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, him and his wife live alone.

12:36.556 --> 12:41.311
They wanna move out to California
and live near their married daughter.

12:41.436 --> 12:45.231
Well, he wants $5,000 down, although
I think I can knock him down to four.

12:45.356 --> 12:47.693
Tommy!

12:47.818 --> 12:51.113
Marty, I gotta run now,
but I'll meet you at mass tomorrow.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.742
Afterwards we'll discuss it.
It sounds like a good proposition.

12:54.867 --> 12:57.912
- OK. He wants an answer by Monday.
- Oh, sure.

12:58.996 --> 13:03.083
We'll work out an arrangement
about my mother. I wanna pay you...

13:03.208 --> 13:05.043
- No, listen...
- Tommy!

13:05.169 --> 13:08.005
We'll talk about it later. Thanks again.

13:08.130 --> 13:10.925
- Goodbye, Marty.
- Goodbye, Virginia. See ya soon.

13:11.050 --> 13:15.764
- Goodbye, Aunt Theresa.
- Goodbye, Aunt Theresa. Thank you.

14:18.371 --> 14:20.999
Hello. Is this Mary Feeney?

14:21.124 --> 14:24.044
Well, could I speak to Miss Mary Feeney?

14:24.169 --> 14:26.630
Just tell her an old friend.

14:33.762 --> 14:35.806
Oh, hello there. Is this Mary Feeney?

14:35.931 --> 14:40.061
Hello there. This is Marty Piletti.
I wonder if you recall me.

14:41.103 --> 14:45.732
Well, I'm kind of a stocky guy. The last
time we met was in the RKO Chester.

14:45.859 --> 14:49.570
You was with a friend of yours and
I was with a friend of mine name of Angie.

14:49.695 --> 14:51.948
This was about a month ago.

14:53.616 --> 14:56.077
The RKO Chester on West Farms Square.

14:57.954 --> 15:02.333
Yeah, you was sittin' in front of us and
we was annoyin' ya and you got mad.

15:02.459 --> 15:05.253
I'm the fella who works in a butcher shop.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.966
Oh, come on, you know who I am.

15:10.634 --> 15:15.139
That's right! And then we went to
Howard Johnson's. You had a milk shake.

15:15.264 --> 15:19.519
Yeah, that's right.
I'm the stocky one, the heavyset fella.

15:21.395 --> 15:26.317
Yeah. Well, I'm glad you recall me,
because I had a pretty nice time that night

15:26.442 --> 15:29.530
and I was wonderin'
how everything was with you.

15:31.322 --> 15:33.784
How's everything?

15:35.744 --> 15:37.787
That's swell.

15:37.912 --> 15:43.043
Yeah, well, I'll tell you why I called.
I was figurin' on takin' in a movie tonight

15:43.168 --> 15:47.255
and I was wonderin' if you and your friend
would care to see a movie tonight

15:47.380 --> 15:49.424
with me and my friend.

15:50.718 --> 15:52.762
Yeah, tonight.

15:54.138 --> 15:59.019
I know it's a little late to call for a date,
but I didn't know myself till...

16:01.937 --> 16:03.981
Yeah, I know.

16:04.816 --> 16:06.860
Yeah, well, what about...

16:07.610 --> 16:11.990
Well, how about next Saturday night?
Are you free next Saturday night?

16:15.202 --> 16:17.872
Well, what about the Saturday after that?

16:20.833 --> 16:22.877
Yeah.

16:24.002 --> 16:26.214
Yeah, I know.

16:26.339 --> 16:28.383
Oh, I mean, I understand that...

16:30.676 --> 16:32.511
Yeah.

16:34.973 --> 16:37.017
Yeah.

17:11.176 --> 17:13.972
So, what are you
gonna do tonight, Marty?

17:14.097 --> 17:17.893
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out.
I may just hang around the house.

17:18.018 --> 17:20.729
Why don't you go to
the Stardust Ballroom?

17:20.854 --> 17:22.064
What?

17:22.189 --> 17:27.694
I say "Why don't you go to the Stardust
Ballroom?" It's loaded with tomatoes.

17:27.819 --> 17:30.573
- It's loaded with what?
- Tomatoes.

17:30.698 --> 17:33.868
Who told you about
the Stardust Ballroom, Ma?

17:33.993 --> 17:38.122
- Tommy. He say it's very nice place.
- Oh, Thomas!

17:38.247 --> 17:42.126
Ma, it's just a big dance hall, that's all.
I been there a hundred times.

17:42.251 --> 17:44.879
Loaded with tomatoes!
Boy, you're funny, Ma.

17:45.005 --> 17:48.217
Marty, I don't want you
hanging around the house tonight.

17:48.342 --> 17:51.845
- I want you go shave and go dance.
- Ma, when are you gonna give up?

17:51.970 --> 17:55.808
- You got a bachelor on your hands.
- You gonna get married.

17:55.933 --> 18:00.271
Ma, sooner or later there comes a point
in a man's life when he's gotta face facts.

18:00.396 --> 18:03.900
One fact I gotta face is
whatever it is women like, I ain't got it.

18:04.025 --> 18:07.278
I chased after enough girls in my life.
I went to enough dances.

18:07.403 --> 18:09.905
I got hurt enough.
I don't wanna get hurt no more.

18:10.031 --> 18:13.452
I just called up a girl this afternoon.
I got a real brushoff, boy.

18:13.577 --> 18:16.495
I figured I was past the point
of bein' hurt, but that hurt.

18:16.622 --> 18:20.458
Some stupid woman who I didn't even
wanna call up. She gave me the brush.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.711
I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom.

18:22.836 --> 18:26.965
All that ever happened to me there
was girls made me feel like I was a bug.

18:27.091 --> 18:30.594
I got feelings, you know.
I had enough pain. No, thanks, Ma.

18:30.719 --> 18:32.430
- Marty...
- No.

18:32.555 --> 18:34.640
I'm gonna stay home tonight.

18:34.765 --> 18:37.518
- You gonna die without a son.
- So I'll die without a son.

18:37.643 --> 18:41.272
- Marty, put on the blue suit, huh?
- Blue suit, grey suit.

18:41.397 --> 18:44.734
I'm just a fat, little man. A fat, ugly man.

18:44.859 --> 18:47.571
- You not ugly.
- I'm ugly! I'm ugly! I'm ugly!

18:47.696 --> 18:50.156
- Marty.
- Ma! Leave me alone!

18:52.117 --> 18:56.371
Ma, what do you want from me?
I'm miserable enough as it is.

18:56.496 --> 19:00.291
All right, I'll go to the Stardust Ballroom.
I'll put on a blue suit and go.

19:00.418 --> 19:05.380
You know what I'm gonna get for my
trouble? Heartache. A night of heartache!

19:20.062 --> 19:23.149
Loaded with tomatoes!

19:23.275 --> 19:25.401
That's rich.

19:53.848 --> 19:56.727
- Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
- Yeah.

19:57.811 --> 20:01.481
There was a nice-lookin' one over there
with the black dress on.

20:01.607 --> 20:03.858
But she's dancin' now.

20:05.193 --> 20:08.739
Hey, there's a nice-lookin',
little short one for you down there.

20:08.864 --> 20:11.993
- Where?
- Down there. That little one down there.

20:15.413 --> 20:17.540
Oh, yeah.

20:17.665 --> 20:20.209
What do you say? Wanna ask 'em?

20:20.334 --> 20:23.421
I'll take the one
with the flowers on her dress.

20:25.214 --> 20:28.176
Well, I think this music's a little fast.

20:28.301 --> 20:30.345
Just a minute.

20:34.807 --> 20:38.354
Yeah, I think it's all right.
Are they still over there?

21:02.713 --> 21:04.965
What do you say? You wanna dance?

21:09.887 --> 21:13.348
Uh, excuse me. Would you care to dance?

21:13.473 --> 21:16.977
- I don't feel like dancin' just yet.
- Sure.

21:48.719 --> 21:51.138
Clara, have you decided about tomorrow?

21:51.264 --> 21:54.433
Millie, I always go to the movies
with Papa on Sunday.

21:54.559 --> 21:59.105
- I know, but you could have a lot of fun.
- I'm gonna get some cigarettes.

22:02.733 --> 22:07.613
Herb, I told you she wasn't especially
attractive, but she had a lot of charm.

22:07.738 --> 22:09.907
Look, Herb, she's a real nice kid.

22:10.034 --> 22:14.329
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get
one Saturday night off every three weeks.

22:14.454 --> 22:16.498
I was expecting somethin' better.

22:16.624 --> 22:20.335
- D'you like him, Clara?
- Yes. He seems very nice.

22:21.212 --> 22:25.216
- Millie's been after me to fix her up.
- All right, I'm having a fair time.

22:25.341 --> 22:30.137
I get one Saturday night off in three weeks
and I wanted to wind up with something.

22:30.262 --> 22:32.306
- OK. So I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

23:01.504 --> 23:04.508
- Herbie, have you ever been here before?
- Hey!

23:04.633 --> 23:06.468
Herbie!

23:06.593 --> 23:10.555
- What are you doing here?
- I came up to dance. What do you think?

23:10.680 --> 23:14.142
- You here with somebody?
- I'm just here with another girl.

23:14.267 --> 23:18.647
- Where you goin' now?
- For some cigarettes. Left 'em in my coat.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.650
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah, I'll see ya.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.741
Oh, that's a... girl I used to know.

23:41.379 --> 23:45.050
- Boy, it's sure packed in here.
- Some of these kids are awfully young.

23:45.175 --> 23:47.468
You might run into one of your students.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.055
I wouldn't think so.
I teach out in Brooklyn.

23:50.180 --> 23:54.143
- Oh, you been here before, Clara?
- Yes. Twice.

23:54.268 --> 23:58.689
You wanna try and get a table and a drink,
or you just wanna start dancing?

23:58.814 --> 24:03.027
Well, Herb... Herb! What do you say?
We grab a table before we dance?

24:03.152 --> 24:07.114
Listen, you people go grab a table.
I'll be back in a minute.

24:07.239 --> 24:09.283
I'll be right back.

24:10.326 --> 24:13.830
What do you say, Clara, huh?
Come on, we'll grab a table.

24:44.236 --> 24:48.700
- You here stag or with a girl?
- You say somethin'?

24:48.825 --> 24:51.912
Yeah. I was askin' you
if you was here stag or with a girl.

24:52.037 --> 24:56.667
- Oh, I'm stag.
- I got stuck on a blind date with a dog.

24:56.792 --> 25:01.130
I just met an old girl I used to know,
so I need to get rid of the girl I'm with.

25:01.255 --> 25:04.091
Somebody to take her home,
you know what I mean?

25:04.216 --> 25:08.513
- I'd pay you $5 if you take her home.
- What?

25:08.638 --> 25:12.516
I'll introduce you as an old army buddy
of mine and then I'll cut out,

25:12.641 --> 25:17.856
because I got this other girl waiting for
me by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you $5.

25:17.981 --> 25:20.692
- Are you kiddin'?
- No, I'm not kiddin'.

25:22.027 --> 25:24.905
You just can't walk off on a girl like that!

26:49.744 --> 26:52.788
As long as she's goin' home alone,
give me the $5 back.

26:52.914 --> 26:55.667
Look, Mac, you paid me the $5.
The $5 is mine.

27:50.933 --> 27:53.977
Excuse me, miss,
but would you care to dance?

27:57.690 --> 27:59.525
Miss?

28:40.359 --> 28:44.531
- You come up here often?
- I was up here twice before.

28:44.656 --> 28:48.035
Once I came up with a friend of mine
and... once alone.

28:49.494 --> 28:51.538
The last time...

28:52.706 --> 28:55.543
You see that girl sitting over there
in the grey dress?

28:55.668 --> 28:56.794
Yeah.

28:56.919 --> 29:00.631
Well, the last time I was here,
that's where I sat.

29:02.049 --> 29:05.887
I sat there for an hour and a half
without moving a muscle.

29:06.930 --> 29:12.394
Now and then some fellow would kind of
come up to me and then change his mind.

29:14.562 --> 29:19.193
I'll never forget just sitting there for an
hour and a half with my hands in my lap.

29:19.318 --> 29:22.154
Then I began to cry.
I had to get up and go home.

29:23.363 --> 29:25.949
I've begun to cry a lot lately.

29:26.074 --> 29:29.286
I cry a lot, too. I'm a big crier.

29:29.411 --> 29:33.957
This is something recent with me, this
bursting into tears at the slightest thing.

29:34.082 --> 29:36.752
I cry all the time, any little thing.

29:36.877 --> 29:41.758
My brothers, my brothers-in-law always
tell me what a good-hearted guy I am.

29:41.883 --> 29:43.926
You're not good-hearted by accident.

29:44.051 --> 29:48.348
You get kicked around long enough,
you get to be a real professor of pain.

29:48.473 --> 29:50.476
I know exactly how you feel.

29:50.601 --> 29:55.688
I also want you to know I'm having a good
time with you and really enjoyin' myself.

29:55.815 --> 29:59.192
So, you see, you're not such a dog
as you think you are.

30:04.156 --> 30:07.201
I'm having a very good time, too.

30:07.326 --> 30:11.705
So there you are. So I guess
I'm not such a dog as I think I am.

30:11.830 --> 30:14.167
No, you're a very nice guy.

30:14.292 --> 30:17.921
I don't know why some girl
hasn't grabbed you off long ago.

30:18.046 --> 30:21.758
Well, I don't know either.
I think I'm a very nice guy.

30:21.883 --> 30:26.096
I also think I'm a pretty smart guy
in my own way. Excuse me.

30:26.221 --> 30:31.184
I figure two people get married and
they're gonna live together 40, 50 years,

30:31.310 --> 30:35.398
so it's gotta be more than
whether they're just good-lookin' or not.

30:35.523 --> 30:37.608
You think you're not so good-lookin'.

30:37.733 --> 30:41.654
Well, my father was a real ugly man,
but my mother adored him.

30:41.779 --> 30:45.783
She told me how she'd get so miserable
sometimes, like everybody, you know?

30:45.908 --> 30:49.996
And she says my father
always tried to understand.

30:50.121 --> 30:54.960
I used to see them sometimes when
I was a kid sittin' in the livin' room talkin',

30:55.085 --> 30:59.089
and I used to adore my old man,
because he was always so kind.

30:59.214 --> 31:03.719
That's one of the most beautiful things I
have in my life - the way my parents were.

31:03.844 --> 31:06.263
And my father was a real ugly man.

31:06.388 --> 31:09.308
So it doesn't matter
if you look like a gorilla.

31:09.433 --> 31:12.895
See, dogs like us,
we ain't such dogs as we think we are.

31:19.026 --> 31:21.696
I'm 29 years old.

31:22.530 --> 31:25.324
How old are you?

31:25.450 --> 31:27.910
I'm 34.

31:47.556 --> 31:51.560
- Oh, hello, Aunt Theresa. Come on in.
- Is Caterina here?

31:51.685 --> 31:54.564
We didn't say anything.
We thought we'd leave it to you.

31:54.689 --> 31:58.985
We thought you'd put it like how you were
lonely and why doesn't she live with you.

31:59.111 --> 32:04.907
That way it looks like she's doing you
a favour, instead of we're throwin' her out.

32:05.034 --> 32:09.996
- You want Tommy and me to stay?
- No. It's better idea if you and Tommy go,

32:10.121 --> 32:13.959
otherwise she's gonna start to fight
with you and everybody be yelling.

32:14.084 --> 32:16.128
- Hello, Aunt Theresa.
- Hello, Thomas.

32:16.253 --> 32:18.672
Who's there? Who's there?

32:18.798 --> 32:22.176
- It's me, Caterina! How you feel?
- Hey, what are you doin' here?

32:22.301 --> 32:24.262
I come to see you. How you feel?

32:24.387 --> 32:27.682
I got a pain on my left side
and my leg throbs like a drum.

32:27.807 --> 32:31.977
- I been getting pain in my shoulder.
- Hah! I got a pain in my shoulder, too.

32:32.104 --> 32:37.150
I got a pain in my hip and
my right arm aches so much I can't sleep.

32:37.275 --> 32:39.612
Ah, it's a curse to be old.

32:39.737 --> 32:43.699
We got a postcard from
my son Nicky and his bride.

32:43.824 --> 32:47.202
They are in Florida in a big hotel
on their honeymoon.

32:47.786 --> 32:51.957
I got a letter from
my husband's cousin in Abruzzi.

32:52.082 --> 32:54.501
- His mother die.
- Oh.

32:54.627 --> 32:58.589
You remember Emilio DiGiorgio,
who own a tavern in Abruzzi?

32:59.090 --> 33:01.300
- He die.
- Oh.

33:01.425 --> 33:05.304
- You know who else die?
- Who?

33:05.430 --> 33:12.228
You know the old man who live upstairs
in this house? Irishman, always drunk.

33:12.353 --> 33:17.692
He get pleurisy. He stay two weeks
in a hospital. Yesterday he die.

33:18.569 --> 33:24.575
I like to visit you, Caterina, because
you always got such cheerful news.

33:24.700 --> 33:28.329
Hey, kids. Why don't you two kids
go to the movies?

33:28.454 --> 33:30.748
Your mother and me, we be baby-sitter.

33:30.873 --> 33:34.627
- Let's go down to the Kaplans'.
- Sure, sure.

33:34.752 --> 33:38.882
Ma, we'll be down at the Kaplans'
if you want us for anything. OK?

33:45.764 --> 33:48.975
I wake up this morning.
I hear the baby cry, so I wake up.

33:49.100 --> 33:53.230
I come in their room, and that girl,
she's shakin' her hand at the baby.

33:53.355 --> 33:58.361
I said "You brute! Don't you strike
that baby! That's my son's baby!"

33:58.486 --> 34:00.947
- It's her baby, too.
- It's my son Thomas's baby.

34:01.072 --> 34:02.698
But it's not your baby.

34:02.823 --> 34:04.867
I tell you she throw a bottle of milk at me?

34:04.992 --> 34:06.911
I know. I know.

34:07.036 --> 34:09.996
She's a witch, that one, I tell you.

34:10.121 --> 34:12.375
- I tell you what she do yesterday?
- What?

34:12.500 --> 34:14.835
- She give me the evil eye.
- Uffa Caterina.

34:14.960 --> 34:20.425
I keep one eye open when I sleep,
because she's gonna stab me in my bed.

34:20.550 --> 34:24.804
Caterina, I want you to come
and live with me in my house.

34:25.181 --> 34:26.598
Hm?

34:26.723 --> 34:30.395
Your son Thomas and his wife,
they come to my house today.

34:30.853 --> 34:33.688
They say things
are no good in this house.

34:33.815 --> 34:36.567
Caterina, your son is married.

34:36.692 --> 34:40.321
Leave him in peace.
He wants to be alone with his wife.

34:40.446 --> 34:43.114
They don't want no old woman
sittin' in the balcony.

34:43.239 --> 34:47.120
My son Thomas
come to see you this afternoon,

34:47.246 --> 34:51.667
and he say to you he's gonna
throw his mother from this house?

34:51.998 --> 34:56.295
Ooh, Caterina,
don't make an opera out of this.

34:56.420 --> 34:59.675
The three of you and a little baby
in three skinny little rooms.

34:59.967 --> 35:04.721
You know this is no good - old woman
living with a husband and wife.

35:04.846 --> 35:07.600
Two women in the same kitchen,
the house burns up.

35:07.725 --> 35:11.395
So I'm an old garbage bag
put in the street, huh?

35:11.520 --> 35:14.398
Caterina, don't make a tragedy.

35:15.358 --> 35:19.737
Come and live in my house where
you know you be more happier yourself.

35:22.157 --> 35:24.451
It pains they should do this.

35:27.204 --> 35:29.915
I know it pains.

35:31.375 --> 35:33.835
These are the worst years, I tell you.

35:34.128 --> 35:37.423
Caterina, you are very dear to me.

35:38.341 --> 35:41.386
We cried lots of times together.

35:41.511 --> 35:46.641
When my poor husband, he die,
I would be crazy if not for you.

35:46.766 --> 35:52.021
I ask you to come to my house,
because I know I can make you happy.

35:52.146 --> 35:54.399
Please come to my house, Caterina.

35:55.316 --> 35:57.987
These are the worst years, I tell you.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.280
It's gonna happen to you.

36:00.405 --> 36:02.449
I'm afraid to look in a mirror.

36:02.574 --> 36:06.996
I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with
white hair, like the old ladies in the park -

36:07.121 --> 36:11.375
little bundles in black shawl,
waiting for the coffin.

36:11.500 --> 36:15.337
I'm 56 years old,
and what I got to do with myself?

36:15.462 --> 36:19.550
I got strength in my hands.
I wanna clean, I wanna cook.

36:19.675 --> 36:22.262
I wanna make dinner for my children.

36:22.387 --> 36:27.017
Am I an old dog to lay near the fire
till my eyes close?

36:27.142 --> 36:31.605
These are terrible years, Theresa.
Terrible years.

36:34.441 --> 36:36.444
Caterina, listen...

36:36.569 --> 36:40.155
It's gonna happen to you.
It's gonna happen to you!

36:41.281 --> 36:44.701
What are you gonna do
if Marty gets married, huh?

36:44.826 --> 36:46.870
What are you gonna cook?

36:46.995 --> 36:51.876
Where's all the children playin'
in all the rooms? Where's the noise?

36:52.001 --> 36:55.713
It's a curse to be a widow. A curse!

36:56.840 --> 36:59.760
What are you gonna do
if Marty gets married?

36:59.885 --> 37:02.137
What are you gonna do?

37:05.390 --> 37:08.060
I'm gonna put my things in a bag,

37:09.603 --> 37:11.897
and I come to you tomorrow.

37:23.076 --> 37:25.453
Don't worry. We'll come right back.

37:25.578 --> 37:27.371
You teach chemistry? What school?

37:27.497 --> 37:30.207
- Benjamin Franklin High School.
- In Brooklyn?

37:30.332 --> 37:33.586
I went to Theodore Roosevelt
on Fordham Road. It's near my house.

37:33.711 --> 37:36.589
I have a cousin who's a teacher.
He teaches Latin.

37:36.715 --> 37:39.425
He was studying to be a priest,
but he gave it up.

37:39.552 --> 37:42.638
I was pretty good in high school.
I sound like a jerk now.

37:42.763 --> 37:44.932
I got an 82 average. That ain't bad.

37:45.057 --> 37:49.102
I was accepted at City College, but
my old man died, so I had to go to work.

37:49.228 --> 37:50.646
Want some cigarettes?

37:50.771 --> 37:53.482
German was my best class.
That was my best language.

37:53.607 --> 37:57.111
Der, die, das. Des, der, des.
There you are, I still remember.

37:58.571 --> 38:01.283
You know what I was
good at in high school? Math.

38:01.408 --> 38:04.869
You know how long ago
I graduated high school? June 1937.

38:04.994 --> 38:09.999
Holy cow! June 1937!
What is that? 15... 17 years ago!

38:10.124 --> 38:14.212
Holy cow! Seven... Let's see, is that right?
Yeah, 17. That's right.

38:14.337 --> 38:19.760
Where'd it all go? I'm gettin' old. I'm
gonna be 35 years old November 8th. 35!

38:19.885 --> 38:22.013
Wow! Time goes on, boy!

38:22.138 --> 38:24.431
Yeah. 19... June 1937.

38:24.556 --> 38:28.644
My old man died December 1937.
Two o'clock in the mornin', he died.

38:28.769 --> 38:32.773
Bell rings. I knew somethin' was wrong
because my room is on the ground floor.

38:32.899 --> 38:36.402
I had to get outta bed to answer the door,
and there was Mr Stern.

38:36.527 --> 38:40.324
He had a house down about a block away
from us. He moved out, though.

38:40.449 --> 38:44.286
My old man played cards with him and
some other guys. He was a Jewish fella.

38:44.411 --> 38:49.374
So he said "Is your mother home?"
So I knew there was somethin' wrong.

38:49.499 --> 38:52.794
I was only 18, exactly 18 years old
just a month before.

38:52.920 --> 38:56.591
So I said "Is something wrong, Mr Stern?"
I was in my pyjamas.

38:56.716 --> 38:59.468
So he said "Marty, your father died."

38:59.593 --> 39:03.013
My father died right in the middle
of playin' cards, at the table.

39:03.138 --> 39:05.850
He had a heart attack.
He had low blood pressure.

39:05.975 --> 39:08.602
He used to faint a lot, you know.

39:08.729 --> 39:10.771
Boy... Boy, am I talkin'!

39:10.898 --> 39:13.859
Excuse me.
I never talked so much in all my life.

39:13.984 --> 39:16.362
Usually everybody tells me their troubles.

39:16.487 --> 39:19.614
Well, I'm gonna shut up now
and let you get a word in.

39:19.739 --> 39:22.326
Yeah, 17 years ago.

39:22.451 --> 39:25.328
What I been doin' with myself
all that time?

39:25.455 --> 39:28.582
Well, there I go again!
I must be drivin' you crazy.

39:28.707 --> 39:31.877
Most of the time I'm with a girl
I... I can't find a word to say.

39:32.002 --> 39:35.799
I'm gonna shut up and let you get a word
in, because usually I'm not like this.

39:35.924 --> 39:37.759
Usually I...

39:37.884 --> 39:40.845
There I go again! I can't stop talkin'.

39:40.970 --> 39:44.098
I'm on a jag, for Pete's sakes!
You'd think I was loaded.

39:44.224 --> 39:47.393
Well, anyway, like... like I started to say...

39:47.519 --> 39:49.563
Ahi!

39:51.648 --> 39:54.944
I can't stop my mouth. Isn't this stupid?

39:56.529 --> 39:58.697
You got a real nice face, you know.

39:59.031 --> 40:01.075
Really, a nice face.

40:02.034 --> 40:03.786
Thank you.

40:55.632 --> 40:59.136
- Hey, Mac. Anything good inside?
- A bunch of dogs.

41:03.348 --> 41:05.392
Hey, Marty.

41:06.310 --> 41:08.353
Marty, you in here?

41:35.925 --> 41:37.551
So I'm in a kneeling position,

41:37.676 --> 41:42.014
and if you ever tried shootin' a BAR in a
kneeling position, you know what I mean.

41:42.139 --> 41:45.977
I can't hold a steady position.
I'm waverin' back and forth.

41:47.437 --> 41:50.356
So the guy next to me,
he's shootin' from a prone position,

41:50.482 --> 41:52.858
and he's cross-eyed, like I told you.

41:56.153 --> 41:58.782
So just then...

41:58.907 --> 42:02.619
So just then I hear five shots go off
from the guy next to me.

42:04.538 --> 42:09.543
My target goes down. A minute later
the flag comes up. I got five bull's-eyes!

42:13.131 --> 42:18.093
That's how I got the reputation of being
the best shot in the whole battalion!

42:32.650 --> 42:36.113
So when I got out of the army,
Clara, I was lost.

42:36.238 --> 42:39.032
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

42:39.158 --> 42:41.327
I was 25 years old.

42:41.452 --> 42:45.081
What was I gonna do?
Go back to my old job, 40 cents an hour?

42:46.207 --> 42:49.835
I thought maybe I'd go to college
under the GI Bill of Rights.

42:51.170 --> 42:57.051
But my brother Freddie wanted to get
married and I had three unmarried sisters.

42:57.176 --> 43:00.304
In an Italian house, that's a terrible thing.

43:00.430 --> 43:03.308
So I just went to pieces.

43:05.227 --> 43:09.481
I used to walk the streets
till three, four o'clock in the mornin'.

43:11.566 --> 43:15.905
My poor mother...
used to be so worried about me.

43:21.410 --> 43:24.247
God forgive me what
I'm gonna say now, but...

43:26.123 --> 43:28.918
I used to think of doin' away with myself.

43:30.503 --> 43:35.675
I used to stand on the subway and,
God forgive me what I'm gonna say, I...

43:36.843 --> 43:39.846
I used to feel the tracks
suckin' me down under the wheels.

43:39.971 --> 43:41.597
Yes, I know.

43:41.724 --> 43:45.853
I'm Catholic, you know. Even
to think about suicide is a terrible sin.

43:46.311 --> 43:48.564
Yes, I know.

43:50.690 --> 43:55.071
So then Mr Otari, he offered me this job
in his butcher shop and...

43:55.196 --> 43:57.948
Everybody pleaded with me to take it.

43:58.073 --> 44:00.117
So that's what happened.

44:01.035 --> 44:03.079
I didn't wanna be a butcher.

44:04.372 --> 44:07.209
There's nothing wrong
with being a butcher.

44:08.876 --> 44:11.797
Well, it's not an elegant profession.

44:11.922 --> 44:15.884
It's in the lower social scale.
People look down on butchers.

44:16.009 --> 44:18.053
I don't.

44:20.514 --> 44:25.061
Well, the point is Mr Otari
wants to sell his shop now because...

44:25.186 --> 44:30.107
It's a nice little shop. I handle his books

44:30.232 --> 44:32.694
which is not unreasonable.

44:33.986 --> 44:38.074
Takes home net
maybe $100, $150 a week.

44:38.199 --> 44:41.494
Point is, of course, you gotta
worry about the supermarkets.

44:41.619 --> 44:47.000
There's two in the neighbourhood and an
A&P comin' in, at least that's the rumour.

44:47.126 --> 44:52.131
Marty, it's my feeling that
you really want to buy this shop.

44:53.465 --> 44:55.592
Well, that's true. I do.

44:55.717 --> 44:59.973
But it means I gotta take a loan
out in a bank of $8,000.

45:00.098 --> 45:02.142
That's a big note to carry.

45:03.977 --> 45:10.608
Marty, I've known you for three hours,
but I know you're a good butcher.

45:11.693 --> 45:15.863
You're an intelligent,
decent, sensitive man,

45:15.989 --> 45:20.494
and... well, I have a feeling about you.

45:20.619 --> 45:26.458
Like, well, like sometimes one of my kids
comes to see me about something,

45:26.583 --> 45:29.753
and some of these kids, Marty,
in my classes, they...

45:29.878 --> 45:34.008
they have so much warmth
and so much capacity.

45:36.427 --> 45:40.724
Well, that's the feeling I have about you.

45:42.350 --> 45:45.102
If you were one of my students,
I'd say to you

45:45.227 --> 45:49.858
"Go ahead and buy the butcher shop.
You're a good butcher."

45:57.366 --> 46:00.995
Well, there's lots of things
I could do with this shop.

46:01.120 --> 46:03.622
I could organise my own supermarket.

46:03.747 --> 46:06.959
Get a bunch of neighbourhood
merchants together.

46:07.085 --> 46:09.712
That's what a lot of them are doin'.

46:12.131 --> 46:13.966
What do you think?

46:14.091 --> 46:17.554
I think anything you wanna do
you'll do well.

46:19.514 --> 46:21.849
I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic?

46:25.103 --> 46:27.147
Yes, I am.

46:31.151 --> 46:36.865
Look, I only got about $3 on me now, but
I only live about eight blocks from here.

46:36.990 --> 46:41.495
Why don't we go back to my house, I'll get
some dough and we can go somewhere?

46:41.620 --> 46:43.330
I... I really should get home.

46:43.455 --> 46:46.376
It's only a quarter of 12.
The clock's right up there.

46:47.043 --> 46:50.171
I... I really should get home.
I told my father...

46:52.632 --> 46:55.552
Well, I... I suppose a little while longer...

46:56.886 --> 47:01.475
Do you suppose there's someplace
around here I could put on some makeup?

47:01.600 --> 47:05.104
Oh. Hey, Mac!
You got a ladies' room around here?

47:05.229 --> 47:07.273
- In the back.
- In the back.

48:14.676 --> 48:17.763
- She told me, at the risk of her life.
- She always had thin hips.

48:17.889 --> 48:22.560
She told me the doctor told her, if she had
more babies, it'd be at the risk of her life.

48:22.685 --> 48:25.313
When she told me that,
she already had six!

48:25.438 --> 48:29.651
Every time I saw her, she was either
goin' to the hospital or comin' from it.

48:29.776 --> 48:33.446
- She was hatchin' 'em out like eggs.
- Her husband's a skinny fella.

48:33.571 --> 48:38.076
Well, I bumped into her on the street
and she was as big as a barrel.

48:38.201 --> 48:40.454
- I said to her "Mary..."
- Lou, seen Marty?

48:40.579 --> 48:43.915
- No, I ain't seen him all night.
- Where's everybody?

48:44.040 --> 48:46.794
"Didn't you say if you
had another it'd kill you?"

48:46.919 --> 48:48.921
And her husband's a little bit of a man.

48:49.046 --> 48:53.426
Well, last week on Tuesday she gave birth
to her baby in St Elizabeth's Hospital.

48:53.551 --> 48:58.431
- A fine, healthy boy. Nine pounds.
- That's fine. So the doctor was wrong.

48:58.556 --> 49:01.184
Oh, no. She died
right there in the hospital.

49:01.309 --> 49:04.395
Oh, that's a sad story.

49:05.063 --> 49:08.692
- And her husband's that little fella?
- That's the one.

49:08.817 --> 49:11.069
That's a sad story.

49:34.469 --> 49:38.848
...moving out to Port Chester.
It's silly to think of commuting.

49:38.973 --> 49:44.021
I'd have to take the subway down to
125th, then take the bus to the railroad,

49:44.146 --> 49:47.607
and then take the New York, New Haven
and Hartford out to Port Chester.

49:47.732 --> 49:51.486
Then I think I have a 20-minute bus ride
out of Port Chester.

49:52.404 --> 49:56.409
Somebody suggested that I buy a car,
but I'm terrified of cars.

49:57.243 --> 49:59.620
I'm always afraid I'll kill someone.

50:01.998 --> 50:05.459
Of course, it is a fine opportunity for me.

50:05.584 --> 50:09.547
I could never hope to be the head of a
department in the New York City system,

50:09.672 --> 50:12.508
especially not in the science courses.

50:14.052 --> 50:17.389
Of course, I'm not sure
I want to be a department head.

50:17.514 --> 50:20.976
It's mostly executive
and administrative work.

50:21.101 --> 50:23.145
On the other hand...

50:24.397 --> 50:28.401
Well, anyway I told you about my father

50:28.526 --> 50:31.028
and, well, he depends on me a great deal.

50:31.403 --> 50:35.575
Well, let me tell ya, Clara.
I think you're kiddin' yourself.

50:35.700 --> 50:38.411
I mean, I used to think about
leavin' home, you know.

50:38.536 --> 50:41.289
And that's what I used to say:
"My mother needs me."

50:41.414 --> 50:45.460
But when you really come down to it,
that ain't it at all.

50:45.585 --> 50:50.173
We're just afraid to go out on our own. It's
a big step when you go out on your own.

50:50.298 --> 50:54.344
And I think you're kiddin' yourself
when you say your father needs you.

50:54.469 --> 50:57.514
Actually, you need your father.
You know what I mean?

50:57.640 --> 50:59.475
Well, you know what I mean.

50:59.808 --> 51:03.437
You're livin' at home now and
you've got your father and mother there.

51:03.562 --> 51:06.649
You could go on like that,
be a little girl all your life.

51:06.774 --> 51:09.110
I'm afraid of being lonely.

51:09.235 --> 51:12.989
You won't be so lonely.
You'll make friends right away.

51:13.114 --> 51:17.953
Well, actually, I don't make friends easily.

51:18.078 --> 51:21.164
What are you talkin' about?
You're a real likeable person.

51:21.289 --> 51:24.210
You'll make friends
in Port Chester one-two-three.

51:24.335 --> 51:27.505
You'll have people visitin' you
all the time. I'll visit you.

51:27.630 --> 51:32.551
I'll get my brother Freddie's car
or you can call me up when you feel blue.

51:32.676 --> 51:34.970
Or I'll call you up and...

51:35.095 --> 51:38.390
It'll be real nice. Don't be so afraid.

51:46.357 --> 51:48.235
Hey, Marty!

51:48.401 --> 51:51.655
Hey, Marty! Hey, over here!

51:52.614 --> 51:55.742
- Hello, Ralph.
- Hey, Marty. Come over here a minute.

51:57.328 --> 51:59.538
- Excuse me a minute.
- Sure.

52:02.165 --> 52:04.668
- You'll like this guy. He's nice.
- Who? Marty?

52:04.793 --> 52:08.172
- Yeah.
- Oh, this guy's a nice guy, this guy.

52:08.297 --> 52:10.799
- Hi, Ralph. Hello, Leo.
- Hiya, Marty.

52:10.924 --> 52:13.052
Hey, Marty, come here a minute.

52:13.177 --> 52:16.597
Hey, Marty, we got an odd squirrel.
You interested?

52:16.722 --> 52:18.809
What do you mean, Ralph?

52:18.934 --> 52:22.436
Hey, Louise, meet Marty Piletti.
Marty, that's Louise Kelly.

52:22.563 --> 52:26.441
- Hiya.
- We just gonna sit around here all night?

52:26.566 --> 52:30.695
Listen, Marty,
these three squirrels are nurses.

52:30.820 --> 52:33.448
Money in the bank, man.

52:33.573 --> 52:37.327
All goin' over to Leo's house later
because there's nobody there.

52:37.452 --> 52:39.747
These are the girls I told you about.

52:40.665 --> 52:44.460
Wanna get in the car?
She's a pretty nice-lookin' doll.

52:44.585 --> 52:49.799
- I'm with a girl, Ralph.
- Get rid of her. This is money in the bank.

52:49.924 --> 52:54.470
I can't do that, because somebody
already brushed her off once tonight.

52:54.595 --> 52:57.057
This is a good deal here, Marty.

53:06.900 --> 53:09.695
I can't do it, Ralph. Thanks anyway, huh?

53:11.196 --> 53:14.116
- Nice seein' you all.
- Come on, let's get outta here.

53:14.241 --> 53:17.453
- Yeah. We might as well get goin'.
- I'll see ya, Leo.

53:17.578 --> 53:19.914
- So long, Ralph.
- So long, Marty.

53:59.330 --> 54:01.583
Wait a minute. I'll find the light.

54:06.922 --> 54:09.049
I guess my mother ain't home yet.

54:09.174 --> 54:14.054
My cousin Thomas and Virginia must be
at the movies, so they won't be home yet.

54:14.179 --> 54:17.516
- This is the kitchen.
- Yes, I know.

54:17.641 --> 54:19.893
Come on in the dining room.

54:25.525 --> 54:27.569
Sit down.

54:30.029 --> 54:32.407
You want somethin' to eat?
We got chicken.

54:32.532 --> 54:34.993
No, thank you.
I don't think I should stay long.

54:35.118 --> 54:38.204
Oh, sure.
Well, just take off your coat a minute.

54:52.553 --> 54:56.557
I was tellin' you my brother Nicky got
married last Sunday. It was a nice affair.

54:56.683 --> 55:00.519
They had a statue of a woman and there
was whisky spoutin' out of her mouth.

55:00.644 --> 55:05.150
I never saw anything so grand
in all my life. And what a meal!

55:05.275 --> 55:09.112
I'm a butcher, so I know
a pretty good hunk of meat when I see it.

55:09.237 --> 55:12.741
This was choice fillet right off
the top of the chuck. $1.80 a pound.

55:13.282 --> 55:16.203
If you want a cheaper cut of meat,
why, get rib steak.

55:16.328 --> 55:20.332
It's got a lot of waste on it, but it comes
to a buck and a quarter a pound,

55:20.458 --> 55:22.502
if it's trimmed.

55:23.502 --> 55:27.589
Listen, Clara... Make yourself comfortable.
You look all tense.

55:28.466 --> 55:30.510
Oh, I'm fine.

55:32.303 --> 55:35.306
You want me to take you home,
I'll take you home.

55:36.766 --> 55:39.227
Maybe it would be a good idea.

55:52.533 --> 55:55.411
- No, Marty.
- I like you. I been tellin' you all night I do.

55:55.536 --> 55:57.162
- Marty...
- All I want is a kiss.

55:57.287 --> 55:58.831
- Please. Please.
- No, Marty.

55:58.956 --> 56:02.085
All right. All right. I'll take you home!

56:02.210 --> 56:03.920
All I wanted was a lousy kiss.

56:04.045 --> 56:08.591
Think I'd try somethin' serious with
my mother comin' home any minute?

56:11.260 --> 56:13.930
I just didn't feel like it, that's all.

56:38.080 --> 56:40.124
Well...

56:42.168 --> 56:44.630
I'm old enough to know better.

56:47.673 --> 56:51.427
Come New Year's Eve,
everybody starts arrangin' parties.

56:53.471 --> 56:55.933
I'm the guy they gotta dig up a date for.

57:01.438 --> 57:04.358
I'll just get a pack of cigarettes and take...

57:12.575 --> 57:14.827
I'd like to see you again...

57:16.037 --> 57:18.081
very much.

57:20.208 --> 57:24.797
The reason I didn't let you kiss me
was because I just didn't know how to...

57:24.922 --> 57:27.382
handle the situation.

57:30.218 --> 57:32.888
You're the kindest man I ever met.

57:36.600 --> 57:40.980
The reason I tell you this is
because I want to see you again...

57:41.105 --> 57:43.149
very much.

57:45.068 --> 57:51.074
I know when you take me home I'm going
to lie on my bed and think about you.

57:54.744 --> 57:57.206
I want very much to see you again.

58:09.969 --> 58:12.596
What are you doin' tomorrow night?

58:15.390 --> 58:17.434
Nothing.

58:18.561 --> 58:21.022
I'll call you up tomorrow.

58:23.024 --> 58:25.568
Maybe we'll go see a movie.

58:25.693 --> 58:28.155
I'd like that very much.

58:32.450 --> 58:35.538
The reason I can't be
more definite now is...

58:37.455 --> 58:41.252
because my Aunt Catherine's
probably comin' over tomorrow.

58:41.377 --> 58:43.421
I may have to help out.

58:45.047 --> 58:47.508
I'll wait for your call.

58:58.269 --> 59:00.730
I better take you home now.

59:01.856 --> 59:05.235
It's gettin' late and the buses
only run about one an hour.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.696
All right.

59:07.821 --> 59:10.032
I'll just get a pack of cigarettes.

59:44.026 --> 59:46.904
What are you doin' New Year's Eve?

59:48.530 --> 59:50.574
Nothing.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.514
Hello! Hello! Marty?

01:00:16.059 --> 01:00:21.023
- Hello, Marty. When you come home?
- We just got here ten minutes ago, Ma.

01:00:21.148 --> 01:00:25.403
Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder.
She's a graduate of New York University.

01:00:25.528 --> 01:00:28.365
She teaches chemistry
in Benjamin Franklin High School.

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:30.700
Sit down. Sit down.

01:00:30.825 --> 01:00:33.536
You want some chicken?
We got chicken in the icebox.

01:00:33.661 --> 01:00:37.206
No, thank you, Mrs Piletti.
We were just going. Thank you anyway.

01:00:37.331 --> 01:00:41.878
Well, sit down just a minute. I just
come in the house. I take off my coat.

01:00:43.338 --> 01:00:49.553
- Did Thomas give you a ride?
- Sure. Is a sad business.

01:00:49.678 --> 01:00:53.057
My sister Caterina,
she no get along with her daughter-in-law,

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:55.435
so she gonna come live with us.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:59.689
- Oh, she's comin', huh, Ma?
- Sure. Sit down. Sit down.

01:00:59.814 --> 01:01:03.484
- Marty, tell her sit down.
- Might as well sit down a minute, Clara.

01:01:03.609 --> 01:01:07.905
- You offer young lady some fruit?
- I offered her, but she don't want nothin'.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:10.074
No, thank you, really, Mrs Piletti.

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:13.912
Is a very sad business, I tell you.

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:18.958
A woman, 56 years old,
all her life she had her own house.

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:24.381
Now she's just an old woman
sleeping on her daughter-in-law couch.

01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:27.593
It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:32.598
Your children grow up
and then what is left for you to do?

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:35.852
What is a mother's life but her children?

01:01:36.227 --> 01:01:41.400
Is a very sad thing when your son
has no place for you in his house.

01:01:41.525 --> 01:01:45.153
Well, couldn't she find
some kind of hobby to fill out her time?

01:01:45.278 --> 01:01:49.616
Hobby. Hobby. What can she do?
She cook and she clean.

01:01:49.741 --> 01:01:54.454
But you gotta have a house to clean
and you gotta have children to cook for.

01:01:56.123 --> 01:02:01.044
These are the terrible years for a mother.
The terrible years.

01:02:01.503 --> 01:02:04.841
You mustn't feel too harshly
against her daughter-in-law.

01:02:04.966 --> 01:02:09.553
She probably also wants to have a house
to clean and children to cook for.

01:02:09.928 --> 01:02:16.686
You don't think my sister Caterina
should live in her daughter-in-law house?

01:02:16.811 --> 01:02:23.485
Well, I don't know them, but, as a rule, a
mother-in-law shouldn't live with a couple.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:27.072
Where you think
a mother-in-law should go?

01:02:27.197 --> 01:02:32.411
I don't think a mother should depend so
much upon her children for her rewards.

01:02:32.536 --> 01:02:38.459
Well, that's what they teach you
in... New York University.

01:02:38.584 --> 01:02:41.754
In real life it no work out like this.

01:02:41.879 --> 01:02:44.131
You wait till you are a mother.

01:02:44.256 --> 01:02:48.887
It's silly of me to argue about it.
I... I don't know the people involved.

01:02:50.054 --> 01:02:54.726
Ma, I better take her home because
the buses only run about one an hour.

01:02:54.851 --> 01:02:55.852
Sure.

01:02:55.977 --> 01:02:59.272
Good night. I'm glad to have met you.
I hope I see you again.

01:02:59.397 --> 01:03:02.192
OK, Ma. I'll be back
in about an hour, an hour and a half.

01:03:02.317 --> 01:03:05.863
- Sure.
- Good night, Mrs Piletti.

01:03:05.988 --> 01:03:08.031
Good night.

01:03:15.916 --> 01:03:17.876
Hey!

01:03:18.209 --> 01:03:19.794
Hey!

01:03:20.086 --> 01:03:21.921
Hey, Marty! Hey!

01:03:22.046 --> 01:03:24.090
Hey, Ange!

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.265
Marty, where you been?
I been lookin' all over for ya.

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:34.018
I looked all over for you,
but I couldn't find you.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.187
Well, I was lookin' all over for you.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.439
We thought we were gonna go for a walk

01:03:38.564 --> 01:03:41.984
and then we thought we were gonna
come back, but we got to talkin'.

01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:44.987
I want you to meet Clara.
Clara, my best friend Angie.

01:03:45.112 --> 01:03:47.532
- I told you about him.
- Yes. How do you do?

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.283
Hello.

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:55.081
- What we gonna do now?
- I'm taking Clara home. It's close to one.

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:58.876
- You want me to ride down with ya?
- What for?

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:02.673
- It's early.
- It must be one o'clock.

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:05.717
It's Saturday night!
There's still plenty of action around!

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:10.263
Listen, by the time I get Clara home
it's gonna be 1.30.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:15.019
By the time I get home it'll be two. I gotta
get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.

01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:21.525
- OK. I'll see ya.
- Hey, well, where you goin'? Hey, Ange.

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:24.361
Hey, I'll see ya tomorrow after mass, huh?

01:04:53.184 --> 01:04:55.228
You got an elevator in this house?

01:04:55.353 --> 01:04:57.397
We only live one flight up.

01:04:58.314 --> 01:05:00.775
OK. So I'll see you tomorrow.

01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:03.027
OK.

01:05:03.152 --> 01:05:07.616
Uh, I'll give you a call about 11, 11.30,
as soon as I get out of mass.

01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:13.830
Well, better make it around 2.30, because
I won't be home from my aunt's till then.

01:05:13.955 --> 01:05:16.124
Oh, OK.

01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:28.387
OK. So... I'll see you tomorrow night.

01:05:29.681 --> 01:05:31.307
OK.

01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:35.561
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:06:58.566 --> 01:07:00.609
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

01:07:01.193 --> 01:07:04.488
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

01:07:06.532 --> 01:07:08.367
Hey!

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.252
Hey, Ma. You know what
I think I'm gonna do?

01:07:57.377 --> 01:07:59.921
I think I'm gonna buy Patsy's shop.

01:08:13.769 --> 01:08:16.356
You hear what I said, Ma?

01:08:16.481 --> 01:08:20.193
This is how I figure. We got
33-odd hundred dollars in the bank,

01:08:20.318 --> 01:08:23.738
so I'm gonna have to take it out
to buy the shop. So what do you think?

01:08:23.863 --> 01:08:25.281
I don't know.

01:08:25.406 --> 01:08:28.368
I'm a good butcher.
I think I'll make out pretty good.

01:08:28.493 --> 01:08:31.580
I wanna ask Thomas about this,
but I got my own ideas.

01:08:31.705 --> 01:08:33.582
Come on, Marty. It's nine o'clock.

01:08:33.707 --> 01:08:38.127
Listen, Ma, you mind comin' home alone
from church because I wanna find Angie?

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:40.839
- I think he's sore at me for somethin'.
- OK.

01:08:40.964 --> 01:08:44.968
Ma, what I wanna ask you is, is Thomas
bringing Aunt Catherine here or what,

01:08:45.095 --> 01:08:47.264
because I wanna see him?

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:51.309
I think Thomas is gonna bring Aunt
Caterina over here, but I don't know.

01:08:51.434 --> 01:08:54.563
Now, please go outside
because I gotta put on my clothes.

01:08:54.688 --> 01:08:57.774
All right. So what are you
gettin' so sore about?

01:09:04.198 --> 01:09:06.783
Marty? Please excuse what I say.

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:08.952
OK, Ma.

01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:18.379
- Don't you think I feel lousy about it, too?
- I don't wanna talk any more about it.

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:22.091
I don't think I got an hour's sleep
the whole night.

01:09:22.216 --> 01:09:25.303
Last night was the first time
I ever heard my mother cry.

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:28.305
- Tommy, I...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

01:09:28.432 --> 01:09:33.603
I know what you're gonna say. A man's
gotta stop bein' his mother's baby.

01:09:33.728 --> 01:09:36.356
She's my mother.
I have some feelin' about her.

01:09:36.481 --> 01:09:40.194
- Why am I always made to be the louse?
- I don't wanna talk about it!

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:44.615
Look, Tommy... Tommy, I love you
and I know you feel lousy right now,

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.327
but we'll never be happy unless we have
a chance to work out our own lives.

01:09:48.453 --> 01:09:53.792
We can't keep talkin' in whispers the rest
of our lives. We gotta have some privacy.

01:09:58.171 --> 01:10:00.966
Ma! Can't you wait five minutes?
I'll drive you over.

01:10:01.091 --> 01:10:03.385
- I just gotta put on a shirt.
- Go to mass.

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:06.305
I got time to go to mass.
I'll go to 11 o'clock mass.

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:08.474
Let me drive you over, will you, Ma?

01:10:08.599 --> 01:10:10.643
Thomas, leave me alone.

01:10:17.774 --> 01:10:21.403
All right, get dressed because
we're gonna drive my mother over.

01:10:21.528 --> 01:10:24.156
Why couldn't you get along with her,
make an effort?

01:10:24.282 --> 01:10:27.119
She's hard to get along with.
All I asked you was to try!

01:10:27.244 --> 01:10:29.829
- Tommy...
- I don't wanna hear any more about it!

01:11:05.408 --> 01:11:07.243
Hello, Aunt Theresa.

01:11:07.368 --> 01:11:09.204
Hello, Tommy. How you feel?

01:11:09.329 --> 01:11:13.291
Ah, my mother... drives me crazy. I had
to beg her to let me drive her over here.

01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:15.961
- Oh.
- She's always gotta be the big martyr.

01:11:16.086 --> 01:11:18.339
Please, go to mass, huh?

01:11:18.464 --> 01:11:22.760
This one, he wake up this morning
with salt in his nose. Do this! Do that!

01:11:22.885 --> 01:11:25.888
Please leave me alone, huh?

01:11:26.848 --> 01:11:28.349
- Hello, Thomas.
- Hiya.

01:11:28.474 --> 01:11:31.394
Hello, Aunt Catherine.
You gonna go to mass with us?

01:11:31.519 --> 01:11:33.563
- I was to mass two hours ago.
- Oh, good.

01:11:33.688 --> 01:11:36.482
Make yourself at home.
The refrigerator's loaded.

01:11:36.607 --> 01:11:38.985
You go upstairs, take any room
you want, OK?

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:41.446
Thomas!

01:11:41.571 --> 01:11:44.407
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Ah.

01:11:45.366 --> 01:11:48.078
Oh, hi, Virginia.
Oh, you brought him over, huh?

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:50.580
Let me hold him for a minute.

01:11:50.705 --> 01:11:56.044
Hey, Petey boy. Yeah.
You're sure gettin' fat. You know that?

01:11:56.169 --> 01:11:59.298
Yeah. You're bigger
than a leg o' lamb now.

01:11:59.423 --> 01:12:02.385
So, Tom, like I was tellin' you
when you was over here,

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:06.806
my boss wants to sell his shop, because
he wants to move out to California.

01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:10.060
- What are you so sore about?
- Shut up. Will you do me a favour?

01:12:10.185 --> 01:12:13.855
So, Tommy, he does about
$12-1300 gross. The rent's $102.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.150
The problem is the supermarkets.
That's what I wanna ask you.

01:12:17.275 --> 01:12:19.528
If I get together with other merchants...

01:12:19.653 --> 01:12:23.616
What about the time she wanted
to make dinner, but you wouldn't let her?

01:12:23.741 --> 01:12:27.536
- Once a month she can't use the kitchen.
- She could use it any time.

01:12:27.661 --> 01:12:30.622
- You had to be the boss.
- She wouldn't use my pots and pans.

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:34.419
- Pots and pans, my foot!
- You want me to buy new pots and pans?

01:12:34.544 --> 01:12:37.755
Tommy... Tommy...
Look, just give me a coupla minutes.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.884
I told Mr Otari I'd let him know tomorrow.
You and Virginia can fight any time.

01:12:42.009 --> 01:12:45.388
Listen, I wanna know
about individualised mark-ups.

01:12:45.513 --> 01:12:49.058
Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli
is the dairyman and the grocer,

01:12:49.184 --> 01:12:51.937
but he works on a...

01:12:52.062 --> 01:12:57.317
- Do you know what you're talkin' about?
- No, I don't. That's why I'm askin' you!

01:12:57.442 --> 01:12:59.277
Why d'you wanna buy a shop?

01:12:59.402 --> 01:13:03.365
You got a good job, no wife,
no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you.

01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:06.535
What do you wanna buy a shop for?
Take the baby, will ya?

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:11.541
If he wants $5,000 down, you'll have
to carry a mortgage: $60, $70 a month.

01:13:11.666 --> 01:13:15.795
You're single with no responsibilities.
Stay that way. Take my advice.

01:13:15.921 --> 01:13:18.172
Why are you yellin'? He's askin' advice.

01:13:18.297 --> 01:13:21.092
Yeah, Tom, but Patsy's shop
is a specialised trade.

01:13:21.217 --> 01:13:25.973
- Supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
- Who buys Italian? Think my wife does?

01:13:26.098 --> 01:13:30.560
She goes to the A&P, gets a lamb chop
wrapped in Cellophane, and that's dinner!

01:13:30.685 --> 01:13:33.647
- All right.
- I know the problem of the supermarkets,

01:13:33.773 --> 01:13:36.817
but I was talkin' to this girl last night...

01:13:36.942 --> 01:13:40.196
Look, Marty, will you see
my mother is nice and comfortable?

01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:43.700
- Oh, sure. But this girl...
- What girl? What does she know?

01:13:43.825 --> 01:13:46.286
Marty, take care of my mother, will ya?

01:14:00.217 --> 01:14:03.678
Hey, Ma, get ready,
cos I'll be down in a minute.

01:14:03.805 --> 01:14:05.848
- Hey, Caterina.
- Huh?

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:12.062
Last night when I come home from
your house, Marty was here with a girl.

01:14:12.187 --> 01:14:14.274
- Who?
- Marty.

01:14:14.399 --> 01:14:15.816
Your son Marty?

01:14:15.941 --> 01:14:19.863
Well, which Marty you think
would be here in this house with a girl?

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:23.115
- Were the lights on?
- Oh, sure.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.077
This girl is a college graduate.

01:14:26.202 --> 01:14:31.792
They're the worst. College girls
are one step from the street, I tell you.

01:14:31.917 --> 01:14:36.296
My son Joseph's wife,
you know, she type on a typewriter.

01:14:36.421 --> 01:14:38.841
One step from the street.

01:14:40.384 --> 01:14:43.638
This is the first time
Marty brang home a girl.

01:14:43.763 --> 01:14:48.643
She look like a nice girl. You know,
I think Marty has a feeling for this girl.

01:14:49.811 --> 01:14:52.813
You heard him sing?
Sing like that all morning.

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:55.858
Well, that's all. You'll see.

01:14:56.526 --> 01:15:00.572
Today, tomorrow, in a week,
he's gonna say to you

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:06.370
"Hey, Ma, I'm tired of running around.
It's no good to be a single man."

01:15:06.495 --> 01:15:10.624
Then he's gonna say to you "Hey, Ma.
Why we need this old house?"

01:15:10.749 --> 01:15:15.421
"Why don't we sell this old house
and move in a nicer part of town?"

01:15:15.546 --> 01:15:17.381
"Nice little apartment."

01:15:17.506 --> 01:15:19.592
I don't sell this house, I tell you that.

01:15:20.468 --> 01:15:24.555
This is my husband's house.
I had six children in this house.

01:15:24.681 --> 01:15:26.599
You'll see.

01:15:26.725 --> 01:15:31.396
In a couple of months you gonna be
an old lady sleeping on a couch

01:15:31.521 --> 01:15:34.942
- in your daughter-in-law's house.
- Ah, Caterina!

01:15:35.192 --> 01:15:37.235
Where you go, rain go!

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.697
Someday you gonna smile,
we gonna have a big holiday.

01:15:40.822 --> 01:15:44.576
Hey, Ma. What do you say, Ma?
It's gettin' a little late, huh?

01:15:44.702 --> 01:15:46.537
Sure.

01:15:49.122 --> 01:15:54.795
Boy, this place is really comin' to pieces.
Ma, I think we oughta sell this place.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.381
The whole joint's goin' to pieces.

01:15:57.506 --> 01:16:02.679
Plumbing's rusty, everything. Now I'm
gonna have to replaster this whole place.

01:16:05.182 --> 01:16:07.476
You know what we oughta do, Ma?

01:16:07.601 --> 01:16:11.396
Get one of those new apartments
they're buildin' on Southern Boulevard.

01:16:11.521 --> 01:16:13.982
A nicer part of town, you know?

01:16:17.319 --> 01:16:19.989
- You all set, Ma?
- I'm set.

01:16:23.575 --> 01:16:26.287
- Goodbye, Aunt Catherine.
- Goodbye.

01:16:49.812 --> 01:16:51.438
We got a couple of minutes yet.

01:16:51.563 --> 01:16:53.732
- Hi, Marty.
- Hi.

01:16:53.858 --> 01:16:56.027
Ma, fix your coat.

01:16:56.152 --> 01:17:01.407
Hey, Marty, we're gonna sit in the back on
account of the baby. See you afterwards.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.120
That was a nice-looking girl
last night, huh?

01:17:06.787 --> 01:17:11.250
She wasn't a very good-looking girl,
but she look like a nice girl.

01:17:13.169 --> 01:17:16.423
I said she wasn't
a very good-looking girl, not pretty.

01:17:16.548 --> 01:17:18.926
I heard you, Ma.

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:24.015
She look a little bit old for you.
About 35, 40 years old.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.975
She's 29, Ma.

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:29.145
She's more than 29 years old.
That's what she tells you.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:32.606
<i>Buongiorno. Che bella giornata.
La messa comincia fra poco.</i>

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:35.193
She looked 35, 40 years old.

01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:39.239
She don't look like Italian girl.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:44.577
- I say, is she Italian girl?
- I don't know. I don't think so, Ma.

01:17:44.703 --> 01:17:47.247
She don't look like Italian to me.

01:17:48.457 --> 01:17:50.917
What family she comes from?

01:17:52.044 --> 01:17:55.339
I don't know.
Something about her I... I don't like.

01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:01.720
It's funny. The first time you meet the girl,
she comes to your empty house alone.

01:18:03.889 --> 01:18:07.352
These college girls,
they all one step from the street.

01:18:07.477 --> 01:18:10.772
What are you talkin' about?
She's a nice girl.

01:18:10.897 --> 01:18:13.358
She don't look Italian to me.

01:18:16.611 --> 01:18:20.782
- I don't like her.
- You only met her for two minutes.

01:18:20.907 --> 01:18:24.160
- Don't bring her home no more.
- What didn't you like about her?

01:18:24.286 --> 01:18:28.749
I don't know. She don't look like Italian
to me. Plenty nice Italian girls around.

01:18:28.874 --> 01:18:30.793
Let's not fight about it.

01:18:30.918 --> 01:18:34.004
Why are you gettin' so worked up?
I only met her last night.

01:18:34.129 --> 01:18:37.007
Probably not gonna
see her again anyhow.

01:18:37.133 --> 01:18:39.176
Come on.

01:18:51.314 --> 01:18:52.983
- Hello, Lou.
- Hiya, Marty.

01:18:53.108 --> 01:18:54.859
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hiya, Marty.

01:18:54.984 --> 01:18:57.028
Lou, let me have a Coke, will ya?

01:18:58.947 --> 01:19:02.660
Marty, I hear you really got stuck
with a dog last night.

01:19:02.785 --> 01:19:07.456
- Who told you that?
- Angie. Said she was scrawny-looking.

01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:09.625
She wasn't so bad.

01:19:10.501 --> 01:19:14.464
- Was Angie here already?
- He was here last night till about two.

01:19:14.589 --> 01:19:16.215
Oh.

01:19:28.603 --> 01:19:32.482
Hey, Ralph, how'd you make out
with those nurses last night?

01:19:32.607 --> 01:19:35.069
Oh, Marty. Man, didn't I tell ya?

01:19:35.986 --> 01:19:39.240
You know that one that was for you,
the one in the back?

01:19:39.365 --> 01:19:43.494
We went over to Leo's house, you know?
So she got loaded drunk.

01:19:43.619 --> 01:19:45.704
You should have seen what she was doin'.

01:19:45.829 --> 01:19:48.958
Even the people downstairs
started bangin' on the walls.

01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:52.295
So in the middle of the whole thing
the landlord comes in.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.215
These crazy girls
are runnin' around drunk.

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.051
So we gotta get rid of her
because of the landlord.

01:19:58.176 --> 01:20:04.266
So Leo's talkin' to the landlord while we're
tryin' to get this crazy girl out the window.

01:20:04.391 --> 01:20:07.519
This crazy girl,
she even left her shoes up there!

01:20:14.359 --> 01:20:16.112
So how'd you make out?

01:20:16.237 --> 01:20:18.697
- I had a nice time.
- Yeah?

01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:25.496
Uh, she's a nice girl.
Oh, I didn't try anything.

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:33.839
I just met her last night, you know.
She's a nice girl. We just talked.

01:20:35.716 --> 01:20:40.096
Uh... uh... We just talked.

01:20:48.437 --> 01:20:53.776
Listen, Ralph, if you see Angie, tell him
I went home. I'll see him after lunch, huh?

01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:08.208
- I wanna talk to you.
- I don't wanna talk right now.

01:21:39.866 --> 01:21:43.245
So the whole book winds up...
Marty. Hey, Marty.

01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:46.915
So the whole book winds up, Mike
Hammer - he's in the room with this doll.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.086
So he says "You rat, you're the murderer."

01:21:50.211 --> 01:21:53.714
So she begins to con him.
She tells him how she loves him.

01:21:53.839 --> 01:21:57.260
Then bam!
He shoots her right in the stomach.

01:21:57.385 --> 01:22:01.765
So she's layin' there, gaspin' for breath,
and she says "How could you do that?"

01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:04.309
He says "It was easy."

01:22:05.226 --> 01:22:08.396
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy,
he could write.

01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:10.357
I read everything he ever wrote.

01:22:10.482 --> 01:22:13.819
Come on! We got a whole pot.
We give you a plate of your own.

01:22:13.944 --> 01:22:16.738
I couldn't eat nothin'.
My mother just fed me.

01:22:16.863 --> 01:22:21.201
What I like about Mickey Spillane
is he knows how to handle women.

01:22:21.327 --> 01:22:25.999
In one book he picks up this tomato. She
was hit by a car and throws a pass at him.

01:22:26.124 --> 01:22:29.794
Then he meets two beautiful twins,
and they throw a pass at him.

01:22:29.919 --> 01:22:33.423
Then he meets a beautiful society dame,
and she throws a pass at him.

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:36.009
That Mickey Spillane,
he could really write.

01:22:36.134 --> 01:22:39.763
Anybody wanna go down Van Courtland
Park, watch the ball games?

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:42.473
It's only a little bit after two o'clock.

01:22:43.808 --> 01:22:47.020
- Where you goin'?
- To call up that girl from last night.

01:22:47.146 --> 01:22:50.232
- Thought I'd take her to a movie.
- You kiddin'?

01:22:52.484 --> 01:22:55.613
Now, listen, Angie,
you were very impolite last night.

01:22:55.738 --> 01:22:58.490
I introduced you to that girl,
you just walked off.

01:22:58.615 --> 01:23:01.660
- Why'd you do that?
- It got me mad, that's why.

01:23:01.785 --> 01:23:04.456
Hey, Jerry, show Marty
that picture, you know.

01:23:04.581 --> 01:23:07.124
Put it away! My mother's out on the porch.

01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:10.878
- I wonder where they find those girls.
- They're Hollywood starlets.

01:23:11.003 --> 01:23:13.047
Put it away. My mother'll walk in.

01:23:13.172 --> 01:23:16.259
Hey, Marty, let's go down
72nd Street area tonight.

01:23:16.385 --> 01:23:20.305
I don't feel like goin', Angie.
I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:22.849
Boy, you must have
made out good last night.

01:23:22.975 --> 01:23:26.520
- We just talked.
- Boy, she must be some talker.

01:23:26.645 --> 01:23:29.064
She must have been about 50 years old.

01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:33.402
The way I figure, a guy oughta marry
a girl 20 years younger than he is,

01:23:33.527 --> 01:23:37.240
so that when he's 40
she's still a real pretty doll of 21.

01:23:37.365 --> 01:23:40.619
That means he'd have to marry the girl
when she was one year old.

01:23:41.035 --> 01:23:43.371
You're right. I never thought of that!

01:23:43.496 --> 01:23:47.334
- She wasn't so bad-lookin'.
- She must have kept you in the shadows.

01:23:47.459 --> 01:23:51.254
You don't wanna hang around with dogs.
It gives you a bad reputation.

01:23:51.379 --> 01:23:54.049
Let's go down to 72nd Street.

01:23:54.174 --> 01:23:57.344
I told this dog I'd call her up today,
about 2.30.

01:23:57.469 --> 01:23:59.555
Brush her!

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.225
You wanna come with me tonight
or go with that dog?

01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:05.811
- Why you gettin' so sore?
- Cos I looked all over for you last night!

01:24:05.936 --> 01:24:10.191
Another book that I read by Mickey
Spillane, I can't remember the name of it,

01:24:10.316 --> 01:24:12.819
but he finds this red-headed doll
on the streets

01:24:12.944 --> 01:24:16.530
and he gives her some dough
because he feels sorry for her.

01:24:16.655 --> 01:24:21.036
Wait a minute. I think that's the same
book I was tellin' you about before.

01:24:22.496 --> 01:24:26.750
- You didn't like her at all?
- A nothin'. A real nothin'.

01:24:26.875 --> 01:24:30.295
You know somethin'.
This Mickey Spillane.

01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:32.881
Boy, he sure can write.

01:25:31.275 --> 01:25:33.779
So, what are you
gonna do tonight, Marty?

01:25:34.988 --> 01:25:37.200
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out.

01:25:37.325 --> 01:25:39.785
I may just hang around the house and...

01:25:45.374 --> 01:25:48.961
Maybe I'll go down and see
what Angie and the boys are doin'.

01:25:49.086 --> 01:25:51.130
I'll see ya later, Ma.

01:25:56.344 --> 01:25:59.556
<i>We had...
I don't wanna talk like that fella.</i>

01:26:01.224 --> 01:26:03.101
<i>We had the extreme privilege...</i>

01:26:03.226 --> 01:26:07.022
<i>of having Jackie Gleason
make his TV debut on our show.</i>

01:26:07.147 --> 01:26:11.026
<i>So tonight on our anniversary show...</i>

01:26:11.151 --> 01:26:13.195
<i>I'm doing it, huh?</i>

01:26:15.656 --> 01:26:17.700
<i>Oh, now, leave me alone, will ya?</i>

01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.038
<i>You know, he scares the life out of me.</i>

01:26:33.384 --> 01:26:36.386
- What time is it?
- It's about eight o'clock.

01:26:36.511 --> 01:26:38.848
You don't feel like goin' to 72nd Street?

01:26:38.973 --> 01:26:42.268
It’ll take an hour and an hour back.
The whole evening's gone.

01:26:42.393 --> 01:26:47.273
What's playin' on Fordham Road? There's
a good picture in the Loew's Paradise.

01:26:47.398 --> 01:26:49.608
Feel like workin' up a game of cards?

01:26:49.733 --> 01:26:54.405
Come on, let's go down to 72nd Street.
We'll wind up with somethin'.

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:58.576
I'll never forgive La Guardia for
cuttin' out burlesque outta New York City.

01:26:58.701 --> 01:27:01.788
There's a burlesque in Union City.
Let's go to Union City.

01:27:01.913 --> 01:27:04.749
You don't even wanna ride
a half-hour on the subway,

01:27:04.874 --> 01:27:07.919
now you wanna go
all the way down to Union City.

01:27:08.044 --> 01:27:12.674
I feel like playin' cards. I saw Richie Rizzo.
That's what he said he felt like doin'.

01:27:12.799 --> 01:27:16.721
I don't feel like playin' cards.
What do you feel like doin', Angie?

01:27:16.846 --> 01:27:20.015
I don't know. What do you feel like doin'?

01:27:20.141 --> 01:27:22.935
I don't know.
George, what are you doin' tonight?

01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:26.648
"What are you doin' tonight?"
"I don't know. What are you doin'?"

01:27:26.773 --> 01:27:28.816
The burlesque! Loew's Paradise!

01:27:28.941 --> 01:27:31.987
Miserable and lonely.
Miserable and lonely and stupid.

01:27:32.112 --> 01:27:35.448
What am I, crazy or somethin'?
I got somethin' good here.

01:27:35.573 --> 01:27:38.326
What am I hangin' around
with you guys for?

01:27:38.452 --> 01:27:42.247
Wait a minute, will you?
What's the matter with you?

01:27:42.372 --> 01:27:47.044
You don't like her. My mother don't like
her. She's a dog, and I'm a fat, ugly man.

01:27:47.169 --> 01:27:52.049
Well, all I know is I had a good time last
night. I'm gonna have a good time tonight.

01:27:52.174 --> 01:27:56.845
If we have enough good times together,
I'm gonna beg that girl to marry me.

01:27:56.970 --> 01:28:00.433
If we make a party on New Year's,
I got a date for that party.

01:28:00.558 --> 01:28:02.768
You don't like her, that's too bad!

01:28:15.908 --> 01:28:19.369
Hey, Ange, when are you
gonna get married?

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:21.663
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

01:28:21.789 --> 01:28:24.875
You're 33 years old.
All your kid brothers are married.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.753
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

01:28:27.878 --> 01:28:30.172
Hello?

01:28:30.297 --> 01:28:31.716
Excuse me, Ange.

01:28:31.841 --> 01:28:33.885
Hello, Clara?

01:28:49.984 --> 01:28:53.531
<i>What happened? What happened?
Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty!</i>

01:28:53.656 --> 01:28:57.785
<i>Hey, Marty, what happened with you?</i>

01:28:57.910 --> 01:29:01.706
<i>Saturday we had a party, a party.</i>

01:29:01.831 --> 01:29:05.751
<i>Frankie and Lou, everybody but you.</i>

01:29:05.876 --> 01:29:09.339
<i>Where was you Thursday?
Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty!</i>

01:29:09.464 --> 01:29:13.300
<i>Hey, Marty, for our bowling game?</i>

01:29:13.427 --> 01:29:17.138
<i>It seems like a year
since we chug-a-lugged the beer.</i>

01:29:17.263 --> 01:29:21.101
<i>Hey, Marty,
you must have a dame, a dame.</i>

01:29:21.226 --> 01:29:24.521
<i>Hey, Marty, you must have a dame.</i>

01:29:24.646 --> 01:29:29.860
<i>Must have a dame!</i>

01:29:30.305 --> 01:29:36.233
