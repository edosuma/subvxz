09:02.751 --> 09:04.753
[laughs]

09:07.172 --> 09:10.426
Well, well, well...

09:10.509 --> 09:13.304
this is rich.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.597
Coriolanus Burt...

09:15.680 --> 09:17.349
I haven't seen you in years.

09:17.433 --> 09:20.311
No? You didn't catch
my turn on SVU?

09:20.394 --> 09:21.812
I must've blinked
and missed it.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.021
Really?

09:23.105 --> 09:26.566
You missed my performance
as the guy who, at the end,

09:26.650 --> 09:27.734
turned out to have done it?

09:27.818 --> 09:28.902
[gasps]

09:28.986 --> 09:30.488
Look at us--

09:30.570 --> 09:33.907
me just passing by on my way
to tape a podcast

09:33.991 --> 09:38.078
and you standing in line
for an open call

09:38.162 --> 09:41.415
for a play directed
by the third Affleck brother--

09:41.499 --> 09:42.541
Myron.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.293
Look, my agent set this up--

09:44.376 --> 09:48.213
Titus, if you're in this line,
you don't have an agent.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.507
[cell phone rings]

09:49.589 --> 09:52.092
Excuse me,
I have to take this.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.635
Hello?

09:53.718 --> 09:58.015
Yes, I am happy
with my long-distance service...

09:58.098 --> 10:00.600
very happy.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.436
[laughing]

10:05.105 --> 10:07.441
[sighs]

10:09.151 --> 10:11.487
[telephone rings]

10:11.570 --> 10:13.613
Wait, the sign says
"Dr. Grant."

10:13.697 --> 10:16.033
Yes, but Sid pronounces
it "Franff."

10:18.243 --> 10:19.870
These people
are already pretty.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.413
Why are they even here?

10:21.497 --> 10:24.082
Look at her hands.

10:29.713 --> 10:30.881
Mm-hmm.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.342
- Would you like a water?
- Yes.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.552
No, thank you.

10:35.553 --> 10:36.928
Plastic surgeons look at feet?

10:37.012 --> 10:38.096
Oh, yes.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.473
Feet are the new butts, Kimmy.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.977
Dr. Franff is here.

10:44.061 --> 10:48.315
Jacqueline, you look fantastic.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.526
Thank you, Sidney.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.903
[talking through teeth]
Would you like TV while we work?

10:52.986 --> 10:56.698
What do you want to watch?
CNN, pornography?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.325
No, Thank you, Sidney.

10:58.409 --> 10:59.784
I don't have time
for the works today.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.120
I just wanted to talk to you
about my toes.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.539
As you know, Julian loves
my feet,

11:03.622 --> 11:05.123
for sex reasons.

11:05.207 --> 11:06.250
[laughs]

11:06.333 --> 11:08.544
I'm just not feeling good
about them for some reason.

11:08.627 --> 11:11.880
Well, we can do
a toenail re-sizing.

11:11.963 --> 11:15.133
You can have a foot face-lift,
or you can toe tuck them.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.676
[snorting]

11:16.760 --> 11:19.721
- Well, which do you recommend?
- I cannot choose.

11:19.804 --> 11:23.517
That's like asking me which
one of my children's placentas

11:23.601 --> 11:25.143
was the most delicious.

11:25.227 --> 11:26.270
[groans]

11:27.563 --> 11:28.564
Hold on.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.774
Who's this?

11:32.401 --> 11:35.404
What interesting skin you have.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.572
- Oh.
- Look at that.

11:36.655 --> 11:37.697
Thank you.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.617
Absolutely no sun damage.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.245
But you've clearly experienced
a tremendous amount of stress.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.622
What?

11:44.704 --> 11:47.541
Are you a coal miner,
submarine captain?

11:47.625 --> 11:49.042
- No.
- Huh.

11:49.126 --> 11:52.421
Because you have
very distinct scream lines.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.257
Where did those come from,
I wonder.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.967
I don't know.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.510
Too many
fun roller coasters maybe?

11:58.594 --> 12:00.262
[both laughing]

12:00.345 --> 12:03.515
Either way, your problems
are easy to fig.

12:03.599 --> 12:05.476
This brow furrow, zap.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.978
And these frown lines,
we'll flump-up, you know.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.355
- Oh, I don't need all that.
- Oh.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.357
Who am I?
Pamela Lee?

12:12.441 --> 12:13.942
What about those
scream lines, Kimmy?

12:14.025 --> 12:15.611
I know they were bothering you.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.656
Those, we can inject
with the R.E.O. cream,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.907
and instantly gone.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.576
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.119
Of course he or she can.

12:24.202 --> 12:27.122
I can do that right now.
[snorting]

12:27.205 --> 12:28.666
Do it.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.920
Oh, Kimmy,
I'm so excited for you.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.797
Joy comes from the outside in.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.383
[mumbling]

12:38.467 --> 12:39.510
- What, dear?
- I'm sorry?

12:39.593 --> 12:41.094
[mumbling]

12:41.178 --> 12:42.721
I'm sorry.
I still don't have it.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.222
Pardon?

12:44.306 --> 12:46.016
I was saying that we now
validate parking,

12:46.099 --> 12:48.435
if that's important
to you guys at all.

12:48.519 --> 12:50.103
[both] Oh.

12:50.688 --> 12:53.315
[Lillian]
Oh, who's that girl?

12:53.398 --> 12:56.610
What? I didn't do anything?
Got some sun but--

12:56.694 --> 12:58.111
I'm not talking to you, dear.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.613
I'm watching Jeopardy!

12:59.697 --> 13:02.491
The category is
"Worst Madonna Songs."

13:02.574 --> 13:05.452
[host]
This 1987 one is terrible.

13:05.536 --> 13:06.745
[dinging on TV]

13:06.828 --> 13:10.457
That was humiliating.
I'm never auditioning again.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.668
Aw, did you screw the pooch?

13:12.751 --> 13:15.337
Know how that expression
originated?

13:15.420 --> 13:17.297
It wasn't anything
clever at all.

13:17.381 --> 13:18.757
There was this guy and a dog--

13:18.840 --> 13:21.801
Lillian,
I'm trying to tell a story.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.388
So there I am, standing in line
for this cattle call,

13:24.471 --> 13:26.390
and I run into Coriolanus Burt.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.058
Oh, no!
Right?

13:28.141 --> 13:30.769
My nemesis,
the man who stole my career.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.396
When I first moved here,
they were doing

13:32.479 --> 13:33.938
an all-black production
of Oklahoma!

13:34.022 --> 13:35.524
called Alabama!

13:35.607 --> 13:37.192
Coriolanus Burt and I went
head-to-head,

13:37.275 --> 13:38.777
down to the final call-back,

13:38.860 --> 13:41.572
for the role
of Sharecropper Number Two/Cow.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.282
Just as I was about to hit
the women's high C

13:44.366 --> 13:46.493
in People Will Say
We's in Love,

13:46.577 --> 13:49.329
Coriolanus runs
on stage and yells,

13:49.413 --> 13:52.499
"Oh, my God.
They shot Versace."

13:52.583 --> 13:54.668
I mean, rude!

13:54.752 --> 13:56.712
- And guess who got the part?
- You?

13:56.795 --> 13:58.505
A third party that wasn't
in the story?

13:58.589 --> 13:59.839
No!

13:59.923 --> 14:01.675
That should have been
my big break.

14:01.759 --> 14:03.719
And now he's walking around
in shoes and socks

14:03.802 --> 14:05.095
like a big shot.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.346
And look at me--

14:06.430 --> 14:10.392
talented, dashing,
transcending,

14:10.475 --> 14:14.730
but no career, no agent,
and just the one sock.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.065
It isn't good to hold on
to things like that.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.150
You have to work
from the outside in.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.945
I mean, if I can get rid
of my scream lines--

14:22.028 --> 14:23.781
Diva, I thought
you looked real rested.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.365
Then anything is possible.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.743
Tomorrow we are going to put
on our fanciest clothes,

14:27.826 --> 14:29.787
go down to the biggest agency,

14:29.869 --> 14:32.330
and do a series
of leg and arm poses

14:32.414 --> 14:34.999
to project confidence
and get you an agent.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.794
All right!
I'll try it.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.504
[telephone ringing]

14:41.632 --> 14:44.175
He's here
to see an agent, please.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.761
What are we doing exactly?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.095
[talking through teeth]
Trust me.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.972
If you're confident
on the outside,

14:49.055 --> 14:50.474
good things will happen.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.892
I don't know.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.561
Why are you keeping
this important man waiting?

14:54.645 --> 14:55.687
Right this way.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.401
[sighs]

15:01.485 --> 15:04.404
- Would you like a water?
- No, thanks.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.947
I hope he does well in there.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.574
He prepared a monologue
from an episode of Maury

15:07.658 --> 15:09.743
where this guy was afraid
of peaches.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.286
[Titus]
No, Maury.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.788
Get them away from me!

We represent Myron Affleck.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.507

for his Spidermen musical.

Try the pay phone first.

where he lives.

but, au bon pain!

You don't.

15:34.726 --> 15:35.769
No, no, no, no, no.
I've seen your face before.

Are you the girl
from The Bachelor

15:37.354 --> 15:38.772

15:38.856 --> 15:40.858
No, I'm not.
You've never seen me.

- Do what?

in haunted B&Bs.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.122
[slurring speech]

18:47.085 --> 18:48.461
I got to go.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.845
Bye.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.015
Mrs. Voorhees?

19:00.098 --> 19:01.641
Oh, Kimmy,
thank God you're here.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.019
I need you to keep this ice
fresh until my toes set.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.855
No.
This isn't about your feet.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.481
You're just Buhbrezing
your problems!

19:08.565 --> 19:09.941
You'll have
to speak up, dear.

19:10.025 --> 19:11.484
They took part of my ear
and put it in my foot.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.153
Listen, outside-in
doesn't work.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.280
You could have the most
beautiful feet in the world...

19:16.364 --> 19:18.116
How? Tell me.
Is it more surgery?

19:18.199 --> 19:21.244
But it wouldn't fix
what's really wrong.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.996
You're unhappy
about your marriage.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.498
You can smile
and pose all you want,

19:25.582 --> 19:27.125
but that's not going to change.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.920
I'm not really here!
I'm not really here!

19:30.003 --> 19:32.255
Yes, you are.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.631
[gasps]
No! I'm not ready.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.009
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Look.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.510
I look so sad.

19:37.594 --> 19:40.055
- What filter is this?
- None.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.515
Hashbrown, no filter.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.808
That's you, Mrs. Voorhees.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.853
That's your real selfie.

19:46.937 --> 19:48.897
I don't know
what to do, Kimmy.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.108
Julian left Tokyo for Beijing.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.902
He won't take my calls.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.820
If you think
your husband's cheating on you,

19:55.904 --> 19:58.322
you have to confront him.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.283
I have to go to China.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.911
Yes, you can do this.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.955
[laughs]

20:05.038 --> 20:07.373
Oh! Oh!

20:07.457 --> 20:08.708
In the morning.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.878
[gasps]
How did the auditions go?

20:11.962 --> 20:13.838
Amazing.

20:13.922 --> 20:14.965
For more information,
press one.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.133
Beep!

20:16.215 --> 20:17.341
I had just completed
my audition,

20:17.425 --> 20:19.970
when the director himself
stood up

20:20.053 --> 20:23.264
and asked me to leave because
I did not get the part.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.724
But who did I see
on my way out?

20:24.808 --> 20:26.517
Just talk to the director.
Please, just--

20:26.601 --> 20:28.227
What are you doing here?

20:28.311 --> 20:29.896
Are you auditioning for this?

20:29.980 --> 20:32.107
[laughing] Please.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.109
I just left something
in my dressing room

20:34.192 --> 20:36.527
from when I starred in this
theater's last production

20:36.611 --> 20:40.949
of Tony Danza's Big Fat Italian
One-Man Christmas Carol.

20:42.784 --> 20:46.287
So that's just your natural
crotch structure?

20:46.370 --> 20:48.706
Titus, wouldn't you like
to know--

20:48.790 --> 20:50.333
[howling]

20:50.416 --> 20:52.043
My balls! My ball--

20:52.127 --> 20:54.129
So you didn't get the part,
but your enemy did,

20:54.212 --> 20:55.296
and you're happy about that?

20:55.379 --> 20:57.090
Yes, don't you see?

20:57.174 --> 20:58.675
If Coriolanus has
to audition

20:58.758 --> 21:00.885
for the same humiliating roles
as I do,

21:00.969 --> 21:03.013
then that part he stole from me
wasn't the big break

21:03.096 --> 21:04.848
that I thought it was.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.100
Which means your big break
still hasn't happened yet.

21:07.184 --> 21:08.643
[Lillian]
I'm so happy for you.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.979
I love you both so much,

21:11.062 --> 21:12.856
even though I don't always
say it.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.316
- Thank you, Lillian.
- Oh, we love you, too.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.609
Huh?

21:16.693 --> 21:18.569
No, no, no.
Wheel of Fortune.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.864
[woman]
I'd like to solve the puzzle, Pat.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.323
"I'm so happy for you.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.034
I love both of you so much,

21:24.117 --> 21:25.785
even though
I don't always pay it?"

21:25.869 --> 21:28.329
Oh, my God, what a moron!

21:42.093 --> 21:44.512
[telephone rings]

21:44.595 --> 21:46.389
- Hello?
- Hi. Yes.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.307
May I please speak
to Cyndee, please?

21:48.391 --> 21:50.977
I'm sorry, but Cyndee's been
missing f--

21:51.061 --> 21:54.522
Oh, wait.
Old habit.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.024
Cyndee, phone!

21:56.107 --> 21:58.068
- Hello?
- It's Kimmy.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.444
I think you should come visit me
in New York.
