01:37.522 --> 01:38.990
For me?

01:40.090 --> 01:42.527
Okay. So, which one do you want?

01:42.561 --> 01:44.660
These ones.

01:44.694 --> 01:47.330
Come here. Which one? This one?

01:47.364 --> 01:48.366
No, these ones.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.732
This one?

01:49.766 --> 01:50.967
Yes.

01:51.001 --> 01:52.369
Other foot, other foot.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.303
Give me that one.

01:54.337 --> 01:56.372
Heels. I think you're
too young to wear heels.

01:56.406 --> 01:59.542
- I know.
- Let me see.

01:59.576 --> 02:01.245
Beautiful.

02:03.313 --> 02:05.382
- Oh.
- It's okay.

02:17.093 --> 02:19.762
Whatever you do, don't smile.

02:19.796 --> 02:23.533
Whatever you do, don't laugh.

02:43.754 --> 02:50.694
You stay young and high for so long

02:50.728 --> 02:53.929
that one day you look back

02:53.963 --> 02:57.635
and you realize you're all alone.

02:57.669 --> 02:59.670
Help gone,

02:59.704 --> 03:01.772
and what's left?

03:01.806 --> 03:03.474
Nothing.

03:05.241 --> 03:08.479
Thank you for sharing, Melissa.

03:08.513 --> 03:10.314
Anyone else?

03:14.953 --> 03:16.921
Hi, I'm Ashley.

03:16.955 --> 03:18.890
Hi, Ashley.

03:20.425 --> 03:22.560
I lost everything too.

03:25.864 --> 03:27.598
Because of meth.

03:31.870 --> 03:33.636
They said I was an unfit mother.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.639
Took away my little girl.

03:38.909 --> 03:40.377
Every time I do it I think,

03:40.411 --> 03:44.181
"This is the last time.
I can control this."

03:44.215 --> 03:49.653
And I do it again and again and again.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.522
I just can't...

03:54.025 --> 03:55.893
I just can't stop.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.596
I like it too much.

04:02.133 --> 04:03.666
<i>Living one day at a time.</i>

04:03.700 --> 04:06.336
Enjoying one moment at a time.

04:06.370 --> 04:09.439
Trusting that You'll make all things right

04:09.473 --> 04:12.242
if I surrender to Your will.

04:12.276 --> 04:13.476
Amen.

04:13.510 --> 04:14.912
Amen.

04:19.684 --> 04:21.152
Ashley.

04:22.185 --> 04:24.688
I haven't seen you in a while. You okay?

04:25.857 --> 04:27.592
You clean?

04:28.826 --> 04:30.427
How long?

04:32.596 --> 04:34.097
A month.

04:36.668 --> 04:38.603
Like, two days.

04:41.538 --> 04:44.007
If I can't do this,

04:45.442 --> 04:47.210
then I don't get my
daughter back and if I...

04:47.244 --> 04:48.377
I know.

04:48.411 --> 04:50.948
It's not easy.

04:50.982 --> 04:53.216
Have you heard of this book?

04:53.250 --> 04:55.485
<i>The Purpose Driven Life?</i>

04:55.519 --> 04:57.220
Oh, yeah. I have.

04:57.254 --> 04:58.855
It can help.

04:58.889 --> 05:00.524
It helped me.

05:01.959 --> 05:04.561
Ashley, you can't do this alone.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.598
If you need me, call.

05:09.634 --> 05:11.134
Thanks.

05:32.923 --> 05:34.591
Come on.

06:02.819 --> 06:04.754
Face the wall, Mr. Nichols.

06:08.925 --> 06:10.594
Eyes front.

06:27.946 --> 06:29.946
Step inside, please.

06:29.980 --> 06:33.382
Don't wanna keep Judge Barnes waiting.

06:33.416 --> 06:36.286
That suit there is
compliments of your attorney.

07:44.154 --> 07:45.922
Officer Hall down, cell block.

07:45.956 --> 07:47.124
<i>Please send a medic.</i>

07:47.158 --> 07:49.727
<i>Prisoner escaped.
10-23 in progress!</i>

07:55.665 --> 07:57.567
Mr. Nichols, what are you doing?

08:23.894 --> 08:25.362
Stop!

08:34.304 --> 08:35.938
Suspect northwest service corridor.

08:35.972 --> 08:37.341
In pursuit.

08:39.643 --> 08:41.044
Stop!

08:43.681 --> 08:45.816
Stop! Out of the way!

10:35.091 --> 10:37.495
Ugh! I hate this car.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.807
Okay.

10:58.215 --> 10:59.649
Gosh!

10:59.683 --> 11:01.217
Love you too!

11:03.019 --> 11:04.855
Come on! Go.

11:09.726 --> 11:11.427
Have a nice day.

11:23.573 --> 11:25.674
<i>Right now the search
is on for a suspect</i>

11:25.708 --> 11:28.043
<i>after a judge, a court reporter</i>

11:28.077 --> 11:31.481
<i>and a deputy are shot dead
at an Atlanta courthouse.</i>

11:31.515 --> 11:33.749
<i>We're following developments
in this breaking story.</i>

11:33.783 --> 11:36.552
<i>Right now, police
looking for this man.</i>

11:36.586 --> 11:38.888
<i>From the CNN Center in
Atlanta, I'm Miles O'Brien.</i>

11:38.922 --> 11:40.090
<i>And I'm Kyra Phillips.</i>

11:40.124 --> 11:42.893
<i>This hour of CNN's</i> Live
Room <i>starts right now.</i>

11:42.927 --> 11:44.561
<i>Let's just bring you up to
date on what's going on.</i>

11:44.595 --> 11:46.428
<i>An intensive manhunt</i>

11:46.462 --> 11:48.097
<i>all throughout the city of Atlanta</i>

11:48.131 --> 11:49.566
<i>as they look for this suspect</i>

11:49.600 --> 11:51.634
<i>involved in this multiple shooting</i>

11:51.668 --> 11:54.303
<i>at the Fulton County
Superior Courthouse.</i>

11:54.337 --> 11:56.605
<i>Brian Nichols is the suspect</i>

11:56.639 --> 11:58.608
<i>and he is apparently at
loose in the city at large.</i>

11:58.642 --> 12:01.311
You're late, Ashley. Third time this week.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.913
If it happens again,

12:02.947 --> 12:04.847
I'm gonna have to put you on weekends only.

12:04.881 --> 12:07.250
Aw, Randy, you wouldn't do that to me.

12:07.284 --> 12:09.152
It'd break my heart.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.488
Hold on.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.257
Lady dropped this off for you.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.601
Lieutenant Chestnut.
Meredith MacKenzie, TV 7 News.

12:25.635 --> 12:26.635
Could you tell us how the shooter

12:26.669 --> 12:28.038
was able to breach courthouse security

12:28.072 --> 12:30.606
and kill three people?

12:30.640 --> 12:32.209
I'm going on a national in two minutes.

12:32.243 --> 12:34.078
Well, good luck with that.

12:41.150 --> 12:42.818
Two deputies called in sick.

12:42.852 --> 12:44.988
Deputy Cynthia Hall was
alone with Brian Nichols

12:45.022 --> 12:46.322
when he attacked her in the holding cell.

12:46.356 --> 12:48.124
I know Cynthia.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.592
How bad was she hurt?

12:49.626 --> 12:51.294
She's in a coma.

12:53.431 --> 12:55.164
He took her gun,

12:55.198 --> 12:56.832
came in here.

12:56.866 --> 12:58.167
One, two.

12:58.201 --> 12:59.435
Where was the bailiff?

12:59.469 --> 13:00.937
On a clerical errand for the judge.

13:00.971 --> 13:02.205
Any priors?

13:02.239 --> 13:04.273
Minor, until a rape charge.

13:04.307 --> 13:06.308
A disorderly and a drug possession.

13:06.342 --> 13:07.576
Played college football.

13:07.610 --> 13:09.178
Two-year degree in electronics.

13:09.212 --> 13:10.980
Had two good jobs.

13:13.317 --> 13:14.384
What kind of time was he looking at?

13:14.418 --> 13:16.186
25 years.

13:19.589 --> 13:21.591
Department's on full tactical.

13:21.625 --> 13:24.327
We have got to get this
guy back into custody.

13:24.361 --> 13:26.395
Not unless one of ours gets to him first.

13:26.429 --> 13:28.597
I know. We've set up
an emergency task force.

13:28.631 --> 13:32.034
Chief wants you to take lead.

13:32.068 --> 13:33.736
Commander, the press is ready for you.

13:33.770 --> 13:35.405
You got to fix this, John.

13:38.475 --> 13:41.244
Let's get started on Nichols right away.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.380
Friends, girlfriends,
former employers, everybody.

14:09.941 --> 14:11.674
<i>Well, he grew up in Baltimore.</i>

14:11.708 --> 14:13.442
<i>He lived in Florida,
he lived in Atlanta.</i>

14:13.476 --> 14:14.878
<i>He knows his way around</i>

14:14.912 --> 14:17.147
<i>if he can get to some of
these other communities.</i>

14:17.181 --> 14:20.549
<i>But my bet right now is that
he stayed in that local area.</i>

14:20.583 --> 14:22.485
<i>He stays in the area that he knows.</i>

14:22.519 --> 14:24.821
<i>Try to let some of
the heat come off.</i>

14:24.855 --> 14:27.490
<i>And this may turn out to not only be</i>

14:27.524 --> 14:28.858
<i>the biggest manhunt in Georgia,</i>

14:28.892 --> 14:31.061
<i>but the biggest manhunt in America.</i>

15:27.250 --> 15:28.718
Yeah, it's okay.

16:01.817 --> 16:03.186
This the rape victim?

16:03.220 --> 16:04.687
No, this is the one he had a child with.

16:04.721 --> 16:06.188
Lynn Campbell.

16:06.222 --> 16:08.491
I can't keep it straight with these women.

16:09.692 --> 16:11.561
Thank God you're here!

16:11.595 --> 16:13.562
Ms. Campbell, Sergeant Carmen Sandoval.

16:13.596 --> 16:15.065
This is Lieutenant John Chestnut.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.166
Has Brian Nichols tried
to contact you in any way?

16:17.200 --> 16:18.667
- No.
- You sure?

16:18.701 --> 16:20.736
Of course I'm sure.

16:20.770 --> 16:24.005
After I found out what he did to his ex,

16:24.039 --> 16:26.309
I have refused to have
anything to do with him.

16:36.919 --> 16:39.422
Look at this little guy.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.257
What's his name?

16:41.291 --> 16:42.524
Christopher.

16:42.558 --> 16:44.193
Hi, Chris.

16:48.566 --> 16:50.633
Did you know any of Brian's friends?

16:50.667 --> 16:53.135
Places where he would go?

16:53.169 --> 16:55.538
He never really opened up to me much.

16:55.572 --> 16:57.606
Other than work and the gym,

16:57.640 --> 16:59.241
I don't know where else he would go.

16:59.275 --> 17:00.409
Any guesses?

17:00.443 --> 17:01.878
I told you, I don't know!

17:01.912 --> 17:03.211
It's just that he might
have divulged information

17:03.245 --> 17:04.481
without meaning to.

17:04.515 --> 17:07.282
Like I said, I don't know.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.218
Look, we're gonna leave these
two officers here with you.

17:09.252 --> 17:10.352
Sound good?

17:10.386 --> 17:12.454
It does.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.992
Is it all right if we look around?

17:15.026 --> 17:16.759
Of course, sure.

17:26.136 --> 17:27.569
Thank you.

17:29.272 --> 17:30.639
Mommy!

17:30.673 --> 17:33.443
Baby girl!

17:33.477 --> 17:35.277
Mommy, guess what?

17:35.311 --> 17:37.679
I took care of the baby ducks in school!

17:37.713 --> 17:40.350
Lucky girl!

17:40.384 --> 17:43.218
I came to drop off the balance
of your first month's rent.

17:43.252 --> 17:44.486
Thank you, Aunt Kim.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.554
You're a sweetheart to do that.

17:45.588 --> 17:46.555
Well, remember, this is a loan.

17:46.589 --> 17:47.591
I expect you to pay me back.

17:47.625 --> 17:49.059
Yeah. I will.

17:49.093 --> 17:50.459
Mmm. Like all the other times?

17:50.493 --> 17:51.761
I said I would.

17:51.795 --> 17:53.795
Mommy, I got a pretty dress

17:53.829 --> 17:55.831
for the Mommy Daughter Show tomorrow.

17:55.865 --> 17:57.934
I bet I'm gonna love it.

18:00.738 --> 18:02.304
Order up.

18:02.338 --> 18:05.574
Can I see your new house, Mommy? Please?

18:05.608 --> 18:06.943
Please.

18:06.977 --> 18:09.244
Hey, sweetie, I'm gonna give you a quarter.

18:09.278 --> 18:12.514
Why don't you run over
and get some gum, okay?

18:12.548 --> 18:15.117
This Mommy Daughter Fashion
Show is important to her.

18:15.151 --> 18:17.320
It's all she's talked about for days.

18:17.354 --> 18:20.590
You need to be there by
9:30, not a minute later.

18:20.624 --> 18:23.590
Don't you roll your eyes at me!

18:23.624 --> 18:25.027
You are her mother and you
need to start acting like it.

18:25.061 --> 18:26.029
You've broken just about every promise

18:26.063 --> 18:27.295
you've ever made to her.

18:27.329 --> 18:29.532
I will be there at 9:30.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.567
Thank you for the loan.

18:35.673 --> 18:37.273
Oh, man! Great.

18:37.307 --> 18:38.842
We'll brush it off.

18:42.479 --> 18:43.745
<i>Reports have come in that</i>

18:43.779 --> 18:45.148
<i>as many as four different vehicles</i>

18:45.182 --> 18:47.583
<i>have been stolen over
the last several hours.</i>

18:47.617 --> 18:49.385
<i>All units, be on the lookout</i>

18:49.419 --> 18:54.190
<i>for a stolen 2004 light
blue Mercury Grand Marquis,</i>

18:54.224 --> 18:59.895
<i>Georgia tags
1-Sam-John-Adam-4-4-George.</i>

19:01.230 --> 19:03.699
<i>Vehicle is currently believed
to be driven by murder suspect</i>

19:03.733 --> 19:05.301
<i>Brian Nichols.</i>

19:05.335 --> 19:06.903
<i>10-4. Appreciate it, Rose.</i>

19:36.866 --> 19:37.933
<i>You look at the actions</i>

19:37.967 --> 19:39.302
<i>of the suspect, Brian Nichols,</i>

19:39.336 --> 19:41.937
<i>in the triple courthouse homicide...</i>

19:41.971 --> 19:44.439
<i>What do you think the
personality profile</i>

19:44.473 --> 19:46.074
<i>of a man like this is?</i>

19:46.108 --> 19:47.177
<i>Well, you know, I've listened</i>

19:47.211 --> 19:48.878
<i>to friends and relatives say</i>

19:48.912 --> 19:50.880
<i>he was really a nice
guy when he grew up.</i>

19:50.914 --> 19:53.515
<i>He was a nice kid, he was
big, nobody messed with him.</i>

19:53.549 --> 19:56.519
<i>But people did mess with
him, the system did.</i>

19:56.553 --> 19:58.955
<i>The system said he couldn't
abuse his girlfriend,</i>

19:58.989 --> 20:00.656
<i>he couldn't tie her up in duct tape,</i>

20:00.690 --> 20:01.925
<i>he couldn't assault her,</i>

20:01.959 --> 20:03.493
<i>he couldn't carry a machine gun.</i>

20:03.527 --> 20:06.328
<i>This is a guy who didn't
like to be told, "No."</i>

20:06.362 --> 20:08.165
<i>And, when the system finally said,</i>

20:08.199 --> 20:09.898
<i>"We're gonna make you pay for this,"</i>

20:09.932 --> 20:12.035
<i>it sounds like this sociopath...</i>

23:04.973 --> 23:06.676
Hey, Aunt Kim.

23:06.710 --> 23:09.645
Ashley, I wanted to apologize for earlier.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.179
I wasn't very nice.

23:11.213 --> 23:13.382
No, it's okay.

23:13.416 --> 23:15.016
<i>No, it's not.</i>

23:15.050 --> 23:17.919
I was rude and unfair.

23:17.953 --> 23:19.054
What's that noise?

23:19.088 --> 23:20.421
<i>Are you at a party?</i>

23:20.455 --> 23:22.824
No, no.

23:22.858 --> 23:26.262
I'm just unpacking, playing my music.

23:26.296 --> 23:27.763
<i>Well, I just wanted you to know</i>

23:27.797 --> 23:29.932
<i>I am proud of you, Ash.</i>

23:30.967 --> 23:32.802
You've been working really hard,

23:32.836 --> 23:35.236
<i>and we're gonna get there.</i>

23:35.270 --> 23:38.107
Thank you, Aunt Kim. That means a lot.

23:39.608 --> 23:44.679
I've got someone here who
wants to talk to her mommy.

23:44.713 --> 23:45.915
<i>Here you go.</i>

23:45.949 --> 23:47.683
Mommy?

23:47.717 --> 23:49.718
Hey, baby girl!

23:49.752 --> 23:51.687
<i>If it's okay, Mommy,</i>

23:51.721 --> 23:55.023
Aunt Kim said we can
come to your new house.

23:55.057 --> 23:56.758
Uh, yeah.

23:56.792 --> 23:58.828
Yeah, baby, that sounds great.

23:58.862 --> 24:01.296
<i>Yay, we're going to go to
Mommy's house tomorrow.</i>

24:01.330 --> 24:02.764
Mommy said it was okay.

24:02.798 --> 24:04.132
Yay.

24:04.166 --> 24:07.035
<i>That's such good news!</i>

24:07.069 --> 24:09.604
Hey, listen, I got a lot to get through

24:09.638 --> 24:12.241
if you're gonna come by,

24:12.275 --> 24:13.877
<i>so I'll see you soon.</i>

24:13.911 --> 24:15.410
<i>I'll say my prayers for you.</i>

24:15.444 --> 24:17.178
I love you.

24:17.212 --> 24:20.049
I love you, too. Bye-bye, sweetheart.

24:23.118 --> 24:24.520
We'll see you in the morning, honey.

24:24.554 --> 24:25.787
<i>Yep. 9:30.</i>

24:25.821 --> 24:27.189
Bye.

24:39.803 --> 24:40.969
Any word on the Mercury?

24:41.003 --> 24:42.338
Nothing yet, sir.

24:43.539 --> 24:46.809
Brian Nichols' mother. Line six.

24:52.749 --> 24:54.984
Hello, Ms. Nichols, thank
you for returning my call.

24:55.018 --> 24:56.453
I called two days ago,

24:56.487 --> 24:58.787
warning the Sheriff's Department about him.

24:58.821 --> 25:00.456
Anyone tell us about this?

25:00.490 --> 25:03.324
<i>I told them what
Brian's friends said.</i>

25:03.358 --> 25:04.627
If things didn't go his way,

25:04.661 --> 25:06.128
how he might act out in
court and hurt someone.

25:06.162 --> 25:08.530
<i>Why didn't anyone listen?</i>

25:08.564 --> 25:11.265
Has he tried to contact you, Ms. Nichols?

25:11.299 --> 25:13.436
He knows better than to call me after this.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.004
Is there anything you could tell me

25:15.038 --> 25:16.938
that will help us find him?

25:16.972 --> 25:18.642
No, sir.

25:20.309 --> 25:23.712
That girl he violated,

25:24.780 --> 25:27.216
he was with her for seven years.

25:27.250 --> 25:29.819
<i>She was like a daughter to me.</i>

25:29.853 --> 25:32.221
<i>I don't want anyone
else getting hurt.</i>

25:35.258 --> 25:37.025
I'll be praying for you.

25:37.059 --> 25:38.927
Thank you for calling, Ms. Nichols.

27:35.944 --> 27:38.347
Help me!

27:41.484 --> 27:43.519
You scream again, and
I will have to kill you.

27:47.923 --> 27:49.491
Please.

28:03.506 --> 28:05.940
- Who else lives here?
- No one.

28:05.974 --> 28:08.010
Get up.

28:12.181 --> 28:13.515
Where's the child?

28:13.549 --> 28:15.884
Lives somewhere else.

28:21.958 --> 28:24.260
What's in there?

28:24.294 --> 28:26.429
Open it. Open it.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.636
You said the child doesn't live here!

28:33.670 --> 28:36.972
It's my surprise for her.
She's coming tomorrow.

28:43.313 --> 28:44.446
Get in the tub.

28:44.480 --> 28:45.747
God, please, no, please.

28:45.781 --> 28:47.282
Get in.

28:49.885 --> 28:51.320
Look at me.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.927
I said, look at me.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.466
You been watching TV today?

29:06.336 --> 29:08.504
- I have a daughter...
- Put your hands out.

29:08.538 --> 29:09.705
She's five years old. If you hurt me...

29:09.739 --> 29:12.408
Put your hands out. Cross your wrists.

29:22.984 --> 29:25.420
Sit down. Sit down!

29:25.454 --> 29:27.622
My name is Ashley Smith. I'm a mother.

29:27.656 --> 29:30.792
Your phone. Where is it?

29:30.826 --> 29:33.363
The landline's not hooked up yet.

29:35.431 --> 29:37.533
I don't trust you.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.467
Do not move.

29:39.501 --> 29:41.637
If you do, I will hurt you.

30:58.114 --> 30:59.582
Your daughter did this?

31:04.519 --> 31:06.755
Kim Rogers.

31:06.789 --> 31:08.257
Who's she?

31:10.092 --> 31:11.527
My aunt.

31:12.628 --> 31:14.529
This where the kid stays?

31:25.441 --> 31:27.408
I can't give you any information.

31:27.442 --> 31:29.077
It's as simple as that.

31:32.682 --> 31:35.850
We're not comfortable with
any of this either, Doctor.

31:35.884 --> 31:38.786
Now, I understand and
appreciate your position,

31:38.820 --> 31:41.857
but if we knew Brian's psychology better,

31:41.891 --> 31:44.360
it would help us immeasurably.

31:44.394 --> 31:46.362
Three people are dead, Dr. Pratt.

31:51.034 --> 31:54.335
Mr. Nichols has episodes of paranoia,

31:54.369 --> 31:56.438
defensiveness, emotional distance,

31:56.472 --> 31:58.407
and he doesn't believe that he actually

31:58.441 --> 31:59.608
committed the rape that he's accused of.

31:59.642 --> 32:01.409
Oh, come on.

32:01.443 --> 32:03.044
Every criminal walks through my door

32:03.078 --> 32:04.879
swears on their mother's
grave they didn't do it.

32:04.913 --> 32:06.348
This man genuinely doesn't believe

32:06.382 --> 32:08.184
he committed the crime.

32:08.218 --> 32:09.818
It shows the depth of his denial.

32:09.852 --> 32:11.820
And you didn't see this coming
when you were examining him?

32:11.854 --> 32:14.790
The man was deeply in denial.

32:25.134 --> 32:27.969
On TV, they said you
played college football?

32:28.003 --> 32:29.471
Get up.

32:42.285 --> 32:44.218
No, no, no, no. No.

32:44.252 --> 32:46.354
No, no, no.

32:46.388 --> 32:48.423
You don't have to do this.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.344
You have any children?

34:53.315 --> 34:54.684
Yeah.

34:57.152 --> 34:59.688
Baby boy.

34:59.722 --> 35:01.490
Newborn.

35:04.027 --> 35:07.429
I didn't know till I found out
from my lawyer three days ago.

35:10.065 --> 35:11.967
They wouldn't even tell me his name.

35:13.668 --> 35:15.737
Why?

35:15.771 --> 35:18.607
Same old stuff.

35:18.641 --> 35:21.342
Always trying to grind me down.

35:21.376 --> 35:23.679
No one wants to listen.

35:23.713 --> 35:25.715
I didn't rape anyone.

35:27.382 --> 35:29.317
What happened?

35:29.351 --> 35:33.121
My lady cheated on me with
a minister from our church.

35:33.155 --> 35:35.458
Can you believe that? A minister.

35:38.393 --> 35:41.964
She was mad because I got
another lady friend pregnant.

35:41.998 --> 35:44.867
But I went to her house to apologize

35:46.735 --> 35:48.871
and I'd had a lot to drink.

35:50.472 --> 35:53.442
But I did not do those
things they say I did.

36:01.150 --> 36:02.484
I loved her.

36:17.833 --> 36:19.702
My husband has some clothes you could wear.

36:27.376 --> 36:29.710
Husband?

36:29.744 --> 36:32.813
He's coming home at 6:00.

36:32.847 --> 36:34.717
He works the night shift.

36:35.985 --> 36:38.719
You said no one else lives here.

36:38.753 --> 36:41.255
No, I said no one else was here now.

36:42.757 --> 36:44.592
Are you lying?

36:45.628 --> 36:47.362
Why would I lie?

36:47.396 --> 36:49.397
Would you prefer I didn't say anything

36:49.431 --> 36:50.865
and then he walks in here?

36:57.507 --> 36:59.275
I guess we'll all have to
get acquainted at 6:00 then,

36:59.309 --> 37:00.776
won't we?

37:03.278 --> 37:05.547
Your husband's clothes, where are they?

37:07.048 --> 37:09.617
In a box in my bedroom closet.

37:23.666 --> 37:25.833
You have my number.

37:25.867 --> 37:27.969
Feel free to call me.

37:35.610 --> 37:37.846
We found the Mercury
Marquis Nichols stole earlier

37:37.880 --> 37:40.315
abandoned up the street.

37:40.349 --> 37:41.650
Can you tell how far the shooter was

37:41.684 --> 37:42.985
from Mr. Wilhelm?

37:44.420 --> 37:46.221
About here.

37:46.255 --> 37:47.723
From the angle of the wound,

37:47.757 --> 37:49.724
Agent Wilhelm was on his knees.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.602
Never got to hit "Send."

38:02.405 --> 38:03.973
What'd she say?

38:05.074 --> 38:07.476
She was bringing him supper
when she found him like this.

38:09.478 --> 38:12.080
Said he always carried
a Glock, even off-duty.

38:12.114 --> 38:14.616
Yeah, we found the holster.

38:14.650 --> 38:17.118
Notify the FBI Field Office.

38:17.152 --> 38:19.020
Let them know Wilhelm was a customs agent.

38:19.054 --> 38:20.288
And while you're at it,

38:20.322 --> 38:21.288
see if you can locate the jail video

38:21.322 --> 38:23.658
of Nichols' attack on Deputy Hall.

38:23.692 --> 38:26.628
Besides her gun, let's see
if he took anything else.

38:41.175 --> 38:43.711
My family doesn't listen to me, either.

38:58.193 --> 39:00.763
They think I'm a liar.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.864
They don't trust me.

39:02.898 --> 39:04.666
That's good to know.

39:17.980 --> 39:22.049
He took her radio. You were right.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.052
I usually am.

39:26.922 --> 39:30.491
<i>Department is offering
a $65,000 reward</i>

39:30.525 --> 39:31.859
<i>for any information that would lead</i>

39:31.893 --> 39:33.761
<i>to the capture of Brian...</i>

39:45.173 --> 39:47.442
<i>Brian Nichols.</i>

39:47.476 --> 39:49.543
<i>This is Lieutenant John Chestnut</i>

39:49.577 --> 39:51.579
<i>from the Atlanta Police Department.</i>

39:53.516 --> 39:56.317
<i>We know you have
Deputy Hall's radio,</i>

39:56.351 --> 39:58.953
<i>and we know you've
been monitoring us.</i>

40:02.791 --> 40:05.027
<i>It's time we had a talk, Brian.</i>

40:08.931 --> 40:11.900
<i>You're an intelligent
man. We can work this out.</i>

40:15.637 --> 40:17.005
Anything?

40:17.039 --> 40:18.874
Nothing yet. Get him talking.

40:22.344 --> 40:24.746
I met your son today.

40:26.614 --> 40:29.384
<i>You know, a son is
something to be proud of.</i>

40:29.418 --> 40:31.854
<i>Truly one of life's blessings.</i>

40:37.291 --> 40:40.228
<i>I know you wanna meet
little Christopher.</i>

40:40.262 --> 40:42.765
<i>I mean, the boy looks just like you.</i>

40:53.943 --> 40:55.611
You hear me, brother?

40:59.914 --> 41:01.817
You are not my brother.

41:03.085 --> 41:05.987
That's right, Brian, I'm not.

41:06.021 --> 41:09.592
<i>I saw you and your posse
at my lady friend's house.</i>

41:11.960 --> 41:13.594
Sorry we missed you.

41:13.628 --> 41:15.962
<i>You've got a $65,000
reward out on me.</i>

41:15.996 --> 41:17.398
Whole damn city's locked down

41:17.432 --> 41:19.634
<i>and you still can't find me.</i>

41:19.668 --> 41:22.904
Yeah, you're right about that, Brian.

41:22.938 --> 41:25.641
Just trying to do our job, you know?

41:25.675 --> 41:28.711
<i>Haven't enough people died today?</i>

41:31.679 --> 41:35.083
<i>Be a tragedy if you
never met Christopher.</i>

41:35.117 --> 41:37.319
<i>Never got to hold him.</i>

41:39.086 --> 41:40.355
<i>Because, truth be told,</i>

41:40.389 --> 41:42.255
<i>you're not getting out of here.</i>

41:42.289 --> 41:44.259
So turn yourself in,

41:44.293 --> 41:47.696
and I promise you, you will meet your son.

41:47.730 --> 41:50.364
<i>You and I both know that's
not the way it goes.</i>

41:50.398 --> 41:53.368
You kill a cop, a cop kills you.

41:53.402 --> 41:55.203
I give you my word,
that's not gonna happen.

41:55.237 --> 41:57.272
Don't lie to me!

41:57.306 --> 41:58.973
<i>Look, Brian, the longer
you stay out there,</i>

41:59.007 --> 42:01.308
the harder it's gonna be
for me to keep that promise.

42:01.342 --> 42:04.246
<i>But the quicker you end this,</i>

42:04.280 --> 42:06.949
<i>the sooner you get
to see Christopher.</i>

42:34.208 --> 42:35.377
<i>How close?</i>

42:35.411 --> 42:36.944
About a three-mile radius,

42:36.978 --> 42:38.913
North Gwinnett to the county line.

42:38.947 --> 42:40.982
Best I can do.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.654
You did good.

42:46.688 --> 42:48.190
Not good enough.

42:51.460 --> 42:53.594
He knows everything we're doing.

42:53.628 --> 42:55.996
He's holed up somewhere with a TV.

42:56.030 --> 42:57.165
Get our people over to Gwinnett

42:57.199 --> 42:59.734
and alert the local P.D.

42:59.768 --> 43:02.403
Beg for as much air support as we can get.

43:07.141 --> 43:09.177
Media still hanging around?

43:10.278 --> 43:11.880
If she's out there, find that reporter,

43:11.914 --> 43:13.181
Meredith MacKenzie.

43:13.215 --> 43:14.382
I wanna talk to her.

43:14.416 --> 43:15.851
Okay.

43:31.333 --> 43:33.101
You got any weed?

43:37.105 --> 43:38.474
Hey.

43:40.009 --> 43:42.143
You got any weed?

43:42.177 --> 43:43.945
I need to relax.

43:45.780 --> 43:47.349
I don't.

43:49.318 --> 43:52.321
Come on, I know you have
something here, party girl.

43:54.155 --> 43:55.824
What you got?

43:57.793 --> 43:59.193
Ashley.

44:00.596 --> 44:03.532
Don't mess with me. What do you got?

44:08.003 --> 44:09.538
I have ice.

44:10.938 --> 44:12.406
What's that?

44:15.277 --> 44:17.012
Meth.

44:20.548 --> 44:22.351
Well, let's break it out.

44:43.105 --> 44:45.007
Ladies first.

45:16.471 --> 45:18.306
Come on, let's go.

45:19.807 --> 45:21.275
No.

45:22.476 --> 45:24.112
What do you mean, "No"?

45:26.014 --> 45:28.617
You go ahead and do it
if you want, but I won't.

46:45.094 --> 46:47.127
Miss MacKenzie.

46:47.161 --> 46:49.230
Please have a seat.

46:54.369 --> 46:57.605
We wanna give you an exclusive.

46:57.639 --> 47:00.440
We need you to broadcast something for us.

47:00.474 --> 47:02.777
You can help us flush Nichols out.

47:02.811 --> 47:04.246
When?

47:06.815 --> 47:08.014
<i>We are being told at this point</i>

47:08.048 --> 47:09.817
<i>that nobody else in the courthouse</i>

47:09.851 --> 47:12.319
<i>knew what was going on
inside that courtroom,</i>

47:12.353 --> 47:14.355
<i>despite the fact that this man</i>

47:14.389 --> 47:16.623
<i>had already shot
the sheriff's deputy</i>

47:16.657 --> 47:18.226
<i>in another part of the complex.</i>

47:18.260 --> 47:19.560
<i>So it's a very disturbing,</i>

47:19.594 --> 47:21.929
<i>tragic, confusing story.</i>

47:21.963 --> 47:24.065
<i>The fact is, three people are dead,</i>

47:24.099 --> 47:25.833
<i>one in the hospital
in critical condition,</i>

47:25.867 --> 47:27.835
<i>and this man, who, if
and when he's caught,</i>

47:27.869 --> 47:30.337
<i>could possibly face the death
penalty here in Georgia,</i>

47:30.371 --> 47:32.172
<i>is still on the loose. Kyra.</i>

47:32.206 --> 47:33.540
<i>Gary Tuchman</i>

47:33.574 --> 47:34.643
<i>outside the courthouse
there, thanks so much.</i>

47:34.677 --> 47:36.277
What time you say your husband was coming?

47:36.311 --> 47:38.580
- 6:00?
- Yes.

47:38.614 --> 47:40.514
Yeah, that's good! That's good.

47:40.548 --> 47:43.183
Gonna be ready. We're in a war.

47:43.217 --> 47:46.121
And I'm a soldier! I am
a soldier for my people.

47:46.155 --> 47:49.924
You can't enslave me! You can't shackle me!

47:49.958 --> 47:52.293
That's right, I am Brian Nichols!

47:52.327 --> 47:53.860
<i>All bus and train stations
will remain closed...</i>

47:53.894 --> 47:56.297
You better shut the
buses and the trains down.

47:56.331 --> 47:57.565
I got it, I got it.

47:57.599 --> 47:59.132
We're gonna go to Mexico.

47:59.166 --> 48:00.234
Gonna get that truck,
we're gonna go to Mexico,

48:00.268 --> 48:01.435
we're gonna rob the banks,

48:01.469 --> 48:02.536
we're gonna pick up Christopher

48:02.570 --> 48:03.670
and we're gonna go to Mexico.

48:03.704 --> 48:04.973
What's your daughter's name?

48:05.007 --> 48:06.540
- Paige.
- Paige, that's right.

48:06.574 --> 48:07.775
We're gonna pick up
Paige and Christopher...

48:07.809 --> 48:10.011
Hey, Brian, I gotta use the bathroom.

48:10.045 --> 48:11.578
Go for it, you use the bathroom.

48:11.612 --> 48:13.147
Everybody's gotta use the bathroom.

48:13.181 --> 48:15.315
We all gotta use the
bathroom. Use the bathroom.

48:15.349 --> 48:16.384
We gotta get that truck, though.

48:16.418 --> 48:18.618
Hey! What are you doing?

48:18.652 --> 48:21.288
I can't go with the door open.

48:22.990 --> 48:24.859
All right, I'll turn
around. I'll turn around.

48:24.893 --> 48:26.460
No, I can't go with you standing there.

48:26.494 --> 48:29.130
I don't trust you, Ashley.

48:29.164 --> 48:30.165
I don't trust you, Ashley.

48:30.199 --> 48:32.000
Okay.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.769
So what are we gonna do?

48:35.336 --> 48:36.871
You're gonna talk, all right?

48:36.905 --> 48:38.505
I'm gonna shut the door and
you're gonna talk. All right?

48:38.539 --> 48:40.040
Yeah, okay.

48:40.074 --> 48:41.475
Hey! Hold on!

48:43.445 --> 48:44.478
I said we're gonna go to Mexico.

48:44.512 --> 48:45.980
We're gonna get that truck.

48:46.014 --> 48:47.882
We're gonna go to Mexico,
gotta rob the bank though.

48:47.916 --> 48:49.449
Understand? Where we going,
Ashley? Where we going?

48:49.483 --> 48:50.719
- Mexico.
- That's right.

48:53.054 --> 48:54.255
The knife!

48:54.289 --> 48:55.690
Give me the knife!

49:00.161 --> 49:02.063
Talk, all right?

49:08.202 --> 49:09.469
Oh, my God.

49:09.503 --> 49:11.338
God, please help me.

49:12.940 --> 49:14.542
I can't hear you!

49:27.789 --> 49:29.156
Ashley, I can't hear you!

49:29.190 --> 49:31.192
Okay.

49:31.226 --> 49:32.560
What do you want me to say?

49:32.594 --> 49:33.994
Should I say the alphabet?

49:34.028 --> 49:35.529
That'll work.

49:35.563 --> 49:38.199
Okay. A, B, C...

49:39.266 --> 49:41.702
D, E, F, G...

49:45.673 --> 49:48.409
H, I, J...

49:50.913 --> 49:52.813
Keep going, Ashley!

49:55.250 --> 49:58.186
K, L, M, N...

50:00.588 --> 50:02.356
Keep going!

50:06.460 --> 50:10.098
It's weird to talk and pee.

50:10.132 --> 50:11.465
Talk about, uh...

50:12.800 --> 50:14.603
Talk about your husband.

50:18.373 --> 50:22.210
He's two years older than
me and we met in high school.

50:25.880 --> 50:28.516
He works at Amalgamated Container.

50:30.652 --> 50:32.354
What else?

50:35.824 --> 50:37.491
How am I supposed to go to the bathroom

50:37.525 --> 50:39.759
if you keep asking me questions?

50:39.793 --> 50:41.829
What's taking so long?

50:44.333 --> 50:46.134
Who have you got in there?

50:46.168 --> 50:47.936
- I can hear people in there.
- What?

50:58.112 --> 50:59.813
What did you...

50:59.847 --> 51:02.549
What did you put in that stuff?

51:02.583 --> 51:03.484
You put something in that stuff.

51:03.518 --> 51:05.220
No.

51:10.625 --> 51:12.226
Why didn't you take it?

51:13.494 --> 51:14.929
Why didn't you take it?

51:14.963 --> 51:16.297
Why didn't you take it?

51:16.331 --> 51:17.898
Uh...

51:17.932 --> 51:21.268
Take it. Come on, take it.

51:21.302 --> 51:22.704
Take it.

51:25.273 --> 51:27.040
No.

51:27.074 --> 51:28.509
What?

51:29.710 --> 51:31.478
Do you want to live?

51:31.512 --> 51:33.080
- Do you want to live?
- I do.

51:33.114 --> 51:34.582
Then take it.

51:38.052 --> 51:39.520
No.

51:42.958 --> 51:44.392
Do it.

53:10.913 --> 53:12.579
What is that? What are you doing?

53:14.014 --> 53:15.583
It's just a book.

53:15.617 --> 53:17.018
What book?

53:19.454 --> 53:21.323
<i>The Purpose Driven Life.</i>

53:23.992 --> 53:25.894
I didn't say you could read.

53:35.103 --> 53:36.604
Read it.

53:43.711 --> 53:45.480
Read it to me.

53:57.791 --> 54:00.127
"It all starts with God.

54:00.161 --> 54:01.962
"It's not about you.

54:01.996 --> 54:03.830
"The purpose of your life is far greater

54:03.864 --> 54:05.900
"than your own personal fulfillment,

54:05.934 --> 54:09.603
"your peace of mind,
or even your happiness.

54:09.637 --> 54:12.540
"It's far greater than
your family, your career,

54:12.574 --> 54:15.676
"or even your wildest dreams and ambitions.

54:15.710 --> 54:17.777
"If you want to know why you
were placed on this planet,

54:17.811 --> 54:19.980
- "you must begin with God..."
- Stop.

54:23.717 --> 54:25.953
That's a bunch of church crap.

54:27.989 --> 54:31.458
Place is full of con artists and hustlers.

54:33.260 --> 54:35.096
My dad went to church every Sunday

54:35.130 --> 54:37.432
and he was a mean drunk.

54:52.612 --> 54:54.748
I've got a demon in me.

55:25.012 --> 55:27.380
Roadblocks north and
south on Duluth Highway.

55:27.414 --> 55:30.851
Peachtree west and east Rogers Bridge.

55:30.885 --> 55:32.152
We miss anything?

55:32.186 --> 55:33.987
Nope. All roadblocks operational.

55:34.021 --> 55:36.089
Aerial surveillance ready.

55:36.123 --> 55:38.558
Get MacKenzie on the phone.
Tell her it's showtime.

55:38.592 --> 55:41.395
I want eyes in the sky.
All choppers up now.

55:41.429 --> 55:42.896
Copy that.

55:44.766 --> 55:46.733
And now, we wait.

55:48.469 --> 55:51.237
<i>He's gonna be sorely missed.</i>

55:51.271 --> 55:53.973
<i>He could teach judges a thing about</i>

55:54.007 --> 55:56.676
<i>how to be a tough judge, but decent.</i>

55:56.710 --> 55:59.714
<i>He did not have what
some lawyers refer to</i>

55:59.748 --> 56:01.114
<i>as "robe-itis," which
is, went to his head.</i>

56:01.148 --> 56:03.384
<i>He was just an approachable,</i>

56:03.418 --> 56:05.286
<i>very, very decent, very smart man.</i>

56:05.320 --> 56:06.587
Brian.

<i>Dennis Scheib,
attorney-at-law</i>

56:07.722 --> 56:09.089
<i>here in Atlanta, Georgia...</i>

56:09.123 --> 56:11.726
I need to leave at 9:00 to see my daughter.

56:12.994 --> 56:15.429
You're not going anywhere.

<i>Next up, Channel 7's

56:20.235 --> 56:21.969
<i>The body of Federal
Agent David Wilhelm</i>

<i>Georgia plate 5PXL456.</i>

56:34.681 --> 56:37.451
We got to get that truck
out of here. Let's go.

56:37.485 --> 56:39.087
Can I at least put on
some warm clothes first?

56:39.121 --> 56:40.453
Hurry up!

56:40.487 --> 56:41.688
<i>...joins us now from the scene</i>

56:41.722 --> 56:43.424
<i>of the shooting of

Hurry up!

56:46.927 --> 56:49.462
<i>Good morning to you,
John. Bring us up to date.</i>

56:49.496 --> 56:51.297
<i>Good morning, Alex. This is
a very active crime scene.</i>

56:51.331 --> 56:53.165
<i>Earlier this morning, we're
not sure exactly when,</i>

56:53.199 --> 56:55.469
<i>Atlanta police got a call that</i>

56:55.503 --> 56:57.772
<i>there was a body of

56:57.806 --> 56:59.040
All I wanted was his truck,

56:59.074 --> 57:00.574
and then he pulled his gun on me.

57:00.608 --> 57:02.342
It was his own fault.

57:02.376 --> 57:03.643
<i>...about eight miles
north of downtown Atlanta</i>

<i>You can perhaps see some of the...</i>

57:07.681 --> 57:09.016
Come on.

57:12.085 --> 57:14.121
I saw some woods down the road.

57:14.155 --> 57:15.455
Know where I mean?

57:15.489 --> 57:17.558
I do.

57:17.592 --> 57:19.561
You drive, I'll follow.

57:21.996 --> 57:23.496
Hey.

57:23.530 --> 57:25.032
I know where the child is.

57:26.333 --> 57:27.902
Don't do anything you'll regret.

57:36.710 --> 57:38.111
God.

58:43.309 --> 58:45.879
No, no, no.

58:45.913 --> 58:47.347
No.

59:03.297 --> 59:05.197
Hey there.

59:05.231 --> 59:06.867
You need some help?

59:09.971 --> 59:11.505
Are you okay?

59:11.539 --> 59:14.075
Yeah, it happens all
the time. I can fix it.

59:29.789 --> 59:31.792
Ma'am, are you sure you're all right?

59:31.826 --> 59:33.326
Yeah, I got it.

59:47.307 --> 59:49.777
Do we know each other from somewhere, man?

59:56.384 --> 59:58.585
Thank you, sir. We appreciate it.

59:58.619 --> 01:00:01.355
Bobby was just following me
to make sure I got home safe.

01:00:10.063 --> 01:00:11.798
You take care of yourself, ma'am.

01:00:12.867 --> 01:00:14.469
Thank you.

01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:01.248
The gate's shut.

01:01:01.282 --> 01:01:02.950
Wait here.

01:01:59.739 --> 01:02:01.241
Let's go.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.028
Why did you do it?

01:02:24.364 --> 01:02:26.299
Why'd you kill all those people?

01:02:35.909 --> 01:02:37.377
No.

01:02:39.514 --> 01:02:41.349
Is this him?

01:02:42.483 --> 01:02:44.819
Mr. Six O'Clock?

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:52.793
Okay, just pull over

01:02:52.827 --> 01:02:55.162
and act like anyone else would.

01:03:12.579 --> 01:03:14.614
Okay, keep driving.

01:03:14.648 --> 01:03:16.951
They're not looking for your car.

01:03:25.025 --> 01:03:27.094
So, what's your husband's name?

01:03:30.164 --> 01:03:31.632
Mac.

01:03:33.067 --> 01:03:35.101
"Big Mac."

01:03:38.039 --> 01:03:41.375
Guess Mac'll be home
in around half an hour.

01:03:45.146 --> 01:03:46.681
No.

01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:51.284
I lied.

01:03:52.719 --> 01:03:55.021
He's not coming home.

01:03:59.126 --> 01:04:00.695
He's dead.

01:04:03.797 --> 01:04:06.599
He was stabbed to death by a drug dealer.

01:04:09.068 --> 01:04:11.639
I should've made him stay home that night.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.177
If I had, he'd still be alive.

01:04:18.913 --> 01:04:20.614
It's all my fault.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.456
I miss him.

01:04:55.548 --> 01:04:57.550
They found Wilhelm's truck.

01:05:01.222 --> 01:05:03.290
He slipped through, John.

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.475
Is this you?

01:05:56.943 --> 01:05:58.278
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:05.952 --> 01:06:09.090
You, uh, want any help with that?

01:06:10.123 --> 01:06:11.524
No.

01:06:14.427 --> 01:06:16.463
Anything I can do around here?

01:06:17.965 --> 01:06:19.300
Well...

01:06:20.967 --> 01:06:24.571
You could hang that mirror
over there, if you want.

01:06:28.208 --> 01:06:29.708
You got any, uh, nails?

01:06:29.742 --> 01:06:31.445
It's right behind you.

01:06:48.594 --> 01:06:49.929
This wall, right here?

01:06:49.963 --> 01:06:51.230
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:48.822 --> 01:07:50.391
Real butter.

01:07:57.965 --> 01:07:59.667
You can read it, if you like.

01:08:03.603 --> 01:08:05.271
Okay.

01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:19.353
Out loud.

01:08:23.256 --> 01:08:25.624
"God deserves your best.

01:08:25.658 --> 01:08:27.160
"He shaped you for a purpose,

01:08:27.194 --> 01:08:28.627
"and He expects you to make the most

01:08:28.662 --> 01:08:29.795
"of what you have been given."

01:08:29.828 --> 01:08:31.832
I haven't been given anything.

01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:38.439
You have a son.

01:08:40.573 --> 01:08:42.643
I'm never gonna see him again, am I?

01:08:46.578 --> 01:08:48.314
If you stop what you're
doing and give yourself up,

01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:49.817
maybe you will.

01:08:54.354 --> 01:08:55.854
Keep reading.

01:09:00.792 --> 01:09:02.261
"He doesn't want you to worry about

01:09:02.296 --> 01:09:04.763
"or covet abilities you don't have.

01:09:04.796 --> 01:09:06.732
"Instead, He wants you to focus on talents

01:09:06.765 --> 01:09:08.402
"He has given you to use.

01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:11.103
"When you attempt to serve God

01:09:11.136 --> 01:09:13.807
"in ways you're not shaped to serve..."

01:09:13.841 --> 01:09:15.774
"Fear is a self-imposed prison

01:09:15.809 --> 01:09:17.243
"that will keep you from becoming

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:19.912
"what God intends for you to be.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:24.484
"You must move against it,
and weapons of faith and love.

01:09:24.518 --> 01:09:29.154
"The Bible says 'well-formed
love banishes fear...'"

01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:33.660
"Job said, 'My life drags
by, day after hopeless day.

01:09:33.694 --> 01:09:36.361
"'And I give up, I'm tired of living.

01:09:36.395 --> 01:09:40.098
"'Leave me alone, my life makes no sense.'

01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:42.835
"The greatest tragedy is not death,

01:09:42.868 --> 01:09:45.072
"but life without purpose."

01:09:47.006 --> 01:09:49.075
"We were made to have meaning.

01:09:49.109 --> 01:09:51.377
"A young man in his twenties wrote,

01:09:51.411 --> 01:09:52.745
"'I feel like a failure,

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:54.246
"'because I'm struggling
to become something

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:56.716
"'and I don't even know what it is.

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:59.651
"'All I know how to do is to get by.

01:09:59.685 --> 01:10:01.788
"'Someday, if I discover my purpose,

01:10:01.822 --> 01:10:04.391
"'I'll feel I'm beginning to live.'

01:10:04.425 --> 01:10:07.928
"When life has meaning, you
can bear almost anything.

01:10:07.962 --> 01:10:09.862
"Without it, nothing is bearable."

01:10:09.896 --> 01:10:12.332
When I heard I had a son...

01:10:19.706 --> 01:10:21.675
I had to break out.

01:10:24.778 --> 01:10:26.880
I don't belong in that place.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:31.051
When I saw what they
were trying to do to me,

01:10:31.085 --> 01:10:33.487
how that judge was trying to enslave me,

01:10:35.989 --> 01:10:38.624
I went into that courtroom

01:10:38.658 --> 01:10:40.561
and I shot him dead.

01:10:41.628 --> 01:10:43.096
You know what?

01:10:46.266 --> 01:10:47.768
It felt good.

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:56.777
If I were the one who killed your husband,

01:11:00.146 --> 01:11:01.914
could you forgive me?

01:11:07.954 --> 01:11:09.722
I don't know.

01:11:14.427 --> 01:11:16.162
Maybe God can.

01:11:44.925 --> 01:11:47.794
<i>Hey, it's Ashley. Leave a message.</i>

01:11:47.828 --> 01:11:49.862
Well, I guess you're in the shower.

01:11:49.896 --> 01:11:51.196
Okay, well, we're leaving the house now,

01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:52.898
so please don't be late.

01:11:52.932 --> 01:11:54.700
All right, we'll see you at 9:30 sharp.

01:11:54.734 --> 01:11:56.703
Aunt Kim, come on, can we go?

01:11:56.737 --> 01:12:00.005
Yeah, let's go meet your
mama at the Fashion Show.

01:12:00.039 --> 01:12:02.074
You look so pretty!

01:12:28.502 --> 01:12:30.237
Brian, it's time.

01:12:31.471 --> 01:12:34.339
I have to leave now.

01:12:34.373 --> 01:12:36.710
I can't be late to see my daughter.

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:26.993
I said, I have to go.

01:13:45.145 --> 01:13:46.880
Okay, I'm leaving.

01:13:49.115 --> 01:13:52.185
Paige needs me. I can't
disappoint her again.

01:14:13.006 --> 01:14:14.574
Wait.

01:14:20.948 --> 01:14:22.816
You'll need this.

01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:34.387
Come on!

01:15:53.239 --> 01:15:55.809
Don't you dare die on me.

01:15:57.610 --> 01:15:59.212
<i>Gwinnett County, 911.</i>

01:15:59.246 --> 01:16:01.312
Yes, my name is Ashley Smith.

01:16:01.346 --> 01:16:03.415
The guy from the courthouse, Brian Nichols,

01:16:03.449 --> 01:16:06.218
he's been holding me hostage
for the past seven hours.

01:16:06.252 --> 01:16:08.088
He just let me go.

01:16:08.122 --> 01:16:09.789
<i>Hold on, let me get
you the hotline number.</i>

01:16:09.823 --> 01:16:14.393
No, this isn't a tip. I
was being held hostage...

01:16:14.427 --> 01:16:17.597
<i>Ma'am, you need to start
from the beginning.</i>

01:16:17.631 --> 01:16:19.731
Brian Nichols is in my apartment,

01:16:19.765 --> 01:16:21.167
Bridgewater Apartments.

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:22.935
<i>Please hold on.</i>

01:16:25.338 --> 01:16:27.472
<i>Miss Smith, this is Sergeant Evans.</i>

01:16:27.506 --> 01:16:28.773
<i>We have your location.</i>

01:16:28.807 --> 01:16:29.808
<i>Stay where you are,
we're sending a...</i>

01:17:30.703 --> 01:17:33.272
<i>There is a man she is identifying</i>

01:17:33.306 --> 01:17:35.307
<i>as Nichols as being
inside her house.</i>

01:17:35.341 --> 01:17:36.676
<i>Now, once again,</i>

01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:38.244
<i>we do not have independent
confirmation...</i>

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:47.820
<i>...is talking about a
woman in Duluth, Georgia</i>

01:17:47.854 --> 01:17:50.123
<i>who has called the
local police to say...</i>

01:18:00.266 --> 01:18:01.901
Visual on them, give me 20 feet.

01:18:01.935 --> 01:18:03.537
You two, the second team.

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.442
So you're saying you
didn't know him at all.

01:18:10.476 --> 01:18:12.078
No.

01:18:12.112 --> 01:18:13.612
I didn't.

01:18:13.646 --> 01:18:15.315
So why'd he pick your apartment?

01:18:15.349 --> 01:18:16.949
I don't know.

01:18:16.983 --> 01:18:18.918
Were there any drugs involved?

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:23.621
Answer the question, yes or no?

01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:26.592
Yeah, there was ice. I didn't do any.

01:18:26.626 --> 01:18:28.560
I don't care what you
did or did not do, ma'am.

01:18:28.594 --> 01:18:30.195
How long ago did Nichols use?

01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:32.231
Um...

01:18:32.265 --> 01:18:34.434
About 4:00 a.m.

01:18:36.368 --> 01:18:38.971
All residents in a two-block radius...

01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:40.940
Paige!

01:18:40.974 --> 01:18:42.842
Paige, stop!

01:18:44.711 --> 01:18:46.479
Stop. Stop!

01:18:51.184 --> 01:18:52.517
<i>They're gonna put a tighter</i>

01:18:52.551 --> 01:18:53.852
<i>circle around the apartment</i>

01:18:53.886 --> 01:18:56.755
<i>where they think
that Nichols may be.</i>

01:18:56.789 --> 01:18:58.658
<i>If it is indeed Brian Nichols</i>

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:00.125
<i>inside of this lady's house,</i>

01:19:00.159 --> 01:19:01.561
<i>is this going exactly the way</i>

01:19:01.595 --> 01:19:03.228
<i>you had just hoped it would not,</i>

01:19:03.262 --> 01:19:04.997
<i>but that you predicted it might?</i>

01:19:07.699 --> 01:19:09.735
<i>This is the worst case scenario</i>

01:19:09.769 --> 01:19:13.638
<i>as far as perhaps him being
in a house with someone else.</i>

01:19:13.672 --> 01:19:16.275
Sir. The landline to the
apartment's up and running.

01:19:18.479 --> 01:19:19.678
<i>If it's him,</i>

01:19:19.712 --> 01:19:21.780
<i>we've got him located someplace.</i>

01:19:21.814 --> 01:19:24.350
<i>This case is breaking so fast, Alex,</i>

01:19:24.384 --> 01:19:25.685
<i>it's hard to get a breath</i>

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:27.253
<i>and it moves to a new phase.</i>

01:19:27.287 --> 01:19:28.954
<i>Hello?</i>

01:19:28.988 --> 01:19:31.557
<i>Hello, Brian Nichols?</i>

01:19:31.591 --> 01:19:33.426
This is Lieutenant John Chestnut again.

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:34.660
<i>The entire area that</i>

01:19:34.694 --> 01:19:36.428
<i>you're showing a shot of right now,</i>

01:19:36.462 --> 01:19:39.398
<i>nobody in, nobody out,
but law enforcement.</i>

01:19:46.338 --> 01:19:47.974
Busy.

01:19:51.543 --> 01:19:54.045
<i>It becomes a road called 141</i>

01:19:54.079 --> 01:19:56.115
<i>which takes you right into Duluth.</i>

01:19:59.985 --> 01:20:02.055
I've got movement.

01:20:05.625 --> 01:20:08.928
Positive I.D. on the suspect.

01:20:08.962 --> 01:20:10.530
Permission to fire.

01:20:12.364 --> 01:20:13.331
<i>This individual,</i>

01:20:13.365 --> 01:20:14.801
<i>Mr. Nichols, sounds like</i>

01:20:14.835 --> 01:20:18.103
<i>he's been somewhat astute
in his observations.</i>

01:20:18.137 --> 01:20:21.240
<i>It sounds to me like he has
stayed off main roads...</i>

01:20:29.682 --> 01:20:31.217
<i>It's very accurate.</i>

01:20:31.251 --> 01:20:32.750
<i>We've got Meredith MacKenzie</i>

01:20:32.784 --> 01:20:36.422
<i>joining us now, reporting live
from Bridgewater Apartments.</i>

01:20:36.456 --> 01:20:38.825
<i>The manhunt during the last 24 hours</i>

01:20:38.859 --> 01:20:40.692
<i>has kept the people
of Atlanta in fear</i>

01:20:40.726 --> 01:20:42.962
<i>from a killer with no conscience.</i>

01:20:44.363 --> 01:20:45.966
He's shooting, take cover!

01:20:47.367 --> 01:20:48.668
What's going on?

01:20:48.702 --> 01:20:50.837
Okay, ma'am, I need you to stay back.

01:20:50.871 --> 01:20:52.170
<i>Brian Nichols!</i>

01:20:52.204 --> 01:20:54.106
<i>Put down your weapon
and come out of there</i>

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.642
<i>with your hands in the air.</i>

01:20:56.676 --> 01:21:00.112
<i>Repeat, come out of there
with your hands in the air!</i>

01:21:00.146 --> 01:21:02.247
All rifles, maintain positions!

01:21:18.731 --> 01:21:20.600
<i>Brian Nichols.</i>

01:21:20.634 --> 01:21:22.534
<i>Time to end this.</i>

01:21:22.568 --> 01:21:24.703
<i>Come out, and give yourself up.</i>

01:21:24.737 --> 01:21:28.408
<i>You're completely surrounded,
no way of winning.</i>

01:21:28.442 --> 01:21:30.476
<i>No need to prolong this situation.</i>

01:21:46.726 --> 01:21:49.194
Go get that Smith woman.
Maybe she could talk him out.

01:22:13.819 --> 01:22:15.387
<i>Sorry I can't come to
the phone right now.</i>

01:22:15.421 --> 01:22:18.990
<i>Leave a message. I will get
back to you as soon as I can.</i>

01:22:19.024 --> 01:22:20.426
Lynn.

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.162
It's Brian.

01:22:24.863 --> 01:22:27.533
I wanted to leave a
message for my little boy.

01:22:27.567 --> 01:22:30.069
For Christopher.

01:22:30.103 --> 01:22:32.405
Please don't erase it.

01:22:32.439 --> 01:22:34.473
Please let him...

01:22:34.507 --> 01:22:38.377
Let him listen to it, when he's old enough.

01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:40.680
Christopher, it's your daddy.

01:22:42.782 --> 01:22:45.351
You're gonna hear some bad things about me.

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:49.422
But, whatever happens,

01:22:49.456 --> 01:22:51.824
whatever people say, I
just want you to know...

01:22:53.193 --> 01:22:54.793
I love you.

01:22:59.131 --> 01:23:00.732
Goodbye, little man.

01:23:12.311 --> 01:23:13.612
What do you want me to say?

01:23:13.646 --> 01:23:15.614
Just say whatever you think is best.

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:20.420
We don't wanna have to
go in there after him.

01:23:26.091 --> 01:23:27.460
<i>Brian.</i>

01:23:29.162 --> 01:23:30.630
<i>It's Ashley.</i>

01:23:34.167 --> 01:23:35.802
<i>I came back.</i>

01:23:40.939 --> 01:23:43.242
<i>It's not too late, Brian.</i>

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:49.582
<i>Brian!</i>

01:23:51.751 --> 01:23:53.920
<i>There is purpose in your life.</i>

01:23:56.288 --> 01:23:57.789
<i>It's time.</i>

01:24:01.493 --> 01:24:03.595
<i>Do the right thing, Brian.</i>

01:24:22.381 --> 01:24:24.250
Thank you for trying.

01:24:25.451 --> 01:24:27.487
Get her to a safe place.

01:24:28.688 --> 01:24:30.323
Officer.

01:24:43.836 --> 01:24:46.172
<i>Okay, Brian, it's over.</i>

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:47.707
<i>Last chance!</i>

01:24:48.841 --> 01:24:51.211
<i>You got exactly 30 seconds!</i>

01:25:19.939 --> 01:25:21.740
He's coming out!

01:25:21.774 --> 01:25:24.076
Hands in the air! Keep it up in the air!

01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:25.276
- Do you see him?
- Affirmative.

01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:26.344
Request permission to fire.

01:25:26.378 --> 01:25:27.745
Stand down!

01:25:27.779 --> 01:25:29.281
Nowhere to go, pal!

01:25:29.315 --> 01:25:31.551
- Show your hands!
- Go, move!

01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:34.053
Go, let's go! Move it, move it!

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:35.686
- In position, right side!
- Faster, come on!

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.422
No civilians behind the building!

01:25:40.894 --> 01:25:43.361
- He's coming out!
- I don't have a visual!

01:25:43.395 --> 01:25:45.798
Come closer, keep walking!

01:25:45.832 --> 01:25:47.132
Keep walking!

01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:49.234
- Get on your knees!
- Get on your knees!

01:25:49.268 --> 01:25:51.736
Get on your knees! Get on your knees!

01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:52.804
On your knees, on your knees!

01:25:52.838 --> 01:25:53.873
Hands behind your head!

01:25:53.907 --> 01:25:55.007
Let's go!

01:25:55.041 --> 01:25:56.275
Get on the ground, now!

01:25:56.309 --> 01:25:57.910
Don't move!

01:25:57.944 --> 01:25:59.111
- Stay down!
- Eyes down!

01:25:59.145 --> 01:26:00.512
Stay down!

01:26:06.019 --> 01:26:07.619
- Get him up, get him up!
- He's clean.

01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:49.495
Team leaders, let's have them check in.

01:27:29.534 --> 01:27:30.970
Ms. Smith...

01:27:33.706 --> 01:27:36.109
I don't know what you went
through in there, ma'am.

01:27:37.176 --> 01:27:39.878
But whatever you did,

01:27:39.912 --> 01:27:41.546
thank you.

01:28:00.498 --> 01:28:03.568
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you can't go in.

01:28:36.903 --> 01:28:39.204
Mommy!

01:28:39.238 --> 01:28:40.673
Paige!

01:28:42.408 --> 01:28:44.743
Ashley!

01:28:44.777 --> 01:28:47.044
I love you so much!

01:28:47.078 --> 01:28:48.646
Darling, are you okay?

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.215
I am now.

01:28:52.318 --> 01:28:53.985
You came.

01:28:54.019 --> 01:28:55.521
Of course we came.

01:28:58.957 --> 01:29:01.826
I'm sorry I wasn't there this morning.

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.162
But from now on, I will be, okay?

01:29:05.564 --> 01:29:07.665
Just you and me.

01:29:07.699 --> 01:29:09.701
I love you.

01:29:09.735 --> 01:29:11.103
I love you, too.

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.641
Oh, thank God.

01:30:13.466 --> 01:30:15.267
I was very nervous. I was scared.

01:30:15.301 --> 01:30:17.436
What have you just done?

01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:19.771
You have just offered the thing

01:30:19.805 --> 01:30:21.272
that has ruined your life

01:30:21.306 --> 01:30:24.109
and made you crazy to a killer.

01:30:24.143 --> 01:30:26.913
- You're dead now.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:30:29.547 --> 01:30:32.918
Yeah, when I read that, I thought, well...

01:30:32.952 --> 01:30:35.121
Jesus loves you, girl.

01:30:36.756 --> 01:30:39.191
Jesus be looking at you.

01:30:39.225 --> 01:30:43.794
Because, to offer crystal
meth to a killer is pretty...

01:30:43.828 --> 01:30:45.864
I thought, I would rather die

01:30:45.898 --> 01:30:48.333
in this apartment tonight,
not doing those drugs.

01:30:48.367 --> 01:30:49.868
I don't care what happens to me

01:30:49.902 --> 01:30:52.870
as long as I make it out of
here alive to see my daughter.

01:30:52.904 --> 01:30:54.405
Were you at that point thinking,

01:30:54.439 --> 01:30:57.308
"I might be able to
live. I think I can live"?

01:30:57.342 --> 01:30:59.844
I was trying to have some hope, yeah.

01:30:59.878 --> 01:31:00.846
He's here, and he wants
to meet you in person.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.646
No way.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:04.016
Please welcome the author of
<i>The Purpose Driven Life,</i>

01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:05.084
Rick Warren.

01:31:16.494 --> 01:31:19.164
Oprah, there are two great
stories in Ashley's life.

01:31:19.198 --> 01:31:20.598
One of them is,

01:31:20.632 --> 01:31:22.700
you don't have to be
perfect to be used by God.

01:31:22.734 --> 01:31:24.636
Yeah.

01:31:24.670 --> 01:31:26.036
If God only used perfect people,

01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:27.338
nothing would get done,

01:31:27.372 --> 01:31:28.574
because none of us are perfect.

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:30.342
I think the other thing is that

01:31:30.376 --> 01:31:32.110
no matter how bad your problems are,

01:31:32.144 --> 01:31:34.012
God's purpose is bigger.

01:31:34.046 --> 01:31:36.048
I think it was Ashley's attitude

01:31:36.082 --> 01:31:37.382
from the whole book

01:31:37.416 --> 01:31:38.984
that actually made the difference,

01:31:39.018 --> 01:31:41.786
in that, everybody's looking for hope.

01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:43.154
Yeah.

01:31:43.188 --> 01:31:44.856
The book's just a book about hope.

01:31:44.890 --> 01:31:47.226
Because when people are
going through a crisis,

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:48.761
they're looking for hope.
