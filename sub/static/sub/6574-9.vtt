15:13.197 --> 15:14.608
Bring him aboard.

15:23.241 --> 15:25.243
[GROANING]

15:25.843 --> 15:29.017
Can't believe we didn't end Superboy
when we had the chance.

15:29.180 --> 15:32.184
Boss Fish still has a soft spot
for his old team.

15:34.285 --> 15:35.923
Do it.

15:36.954 --> 15:38.729
[NORMAL VOICE]:
You sure?

15:39.156 --> 15:40.362
Do it.

[DETONATOR AND BOMB BEEPING]

16:06.933 --> 16:08.276
Oh, no!

16:25.051 --> 16:26.655
Duncan to Watchtower.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.391
Mount Justice is gone.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.036
I mean, there's been an explosion.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.392
A big explosion.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.031
Request immediate assistance.

16:35.195 --> 16:38.108
Get here. Fast.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.977
[ENGINE RUMBLING

16:51.845 --> 16:53.415
Sphere?

[MAL PANTING]

17:19.839 --> 17:21.477
[GASPS]

17:27.079 --> 17:31.620
- Conner. Superboy. Wake up.
- What?

17:31.785 --> 17:35.130
Questions later, man.
Grab Wolf. The S-Cycle's sinking.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.699
Right. Right.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.505
Will Sphere be okay?

17:41.661 --> 17:42.861
Uh, yeah, I think so.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.501
She folds up to heal.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.043
- Can you make it to shore with Nightwing?
- Yeah. I got him.

17:58.745 --> 18:02.887
<i>COMPUTER:
Recognized: Kid Flash, 5-0-3.</i>

18:03.049 --> 18:05.427
What happened?

18:06.219 --> 18:07.721
It was necessary.

18:08.021 --> 18:10.592
It better have been. Spill.

18:11.024 --> 18:15.063
Aqualad needed to find a way
to help us rescue Lagoon Boy.

18:15.228 --> 18:18.607
<i>He'd already injected a microscopic tag
into La'gaan's bloodstream.</i>

18:18.932 --> 18:22.379
<i>And he used the raid on the Cave
to pass essential Intel.</i>

18:23.003 --> 18:27.383
A flash drive with, among other things,
tracking software that can locate the tag.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.110
Like that's all he did.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.016
Wally, he had to make it look good.

18:31.177 --> 18:34.386
He put inhibitor collars on us,
but he knew I'd get us out of them.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.858
He took three more hostages.
Members of your Team.

18:38.018 --> 18:40.692
And we'll rescue them
when we rescue Lagoon Boy.

18:40.854 --> 18:43.596
Dick, he blew up the Cave.
You guys almost died.

18:43.757 --> 18:46.203
No. It's all on the flash drive.

18:46.359 --> 18:50.205
He knew I'd have to pursue to make it look
legit and that's exactly what happened.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.344
He gave us time to get out.
We just...

18:53.500 --> 18:55.878
We got caught in the debris field
from the explosion.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.909
Do you even hear yourself?

18:58.071 --> 19:00.711
What if even one of you
had been left behind, huh?

19:00.874 --> 19:02.251
Why take that risk?

19:02.409 --> 19:04.116
Why go to such extremes?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.718
The drive explains that too.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.424
He needed to cement his position
with the Light...

19:09.582 --> 19:10.890
and the Light's Partner.

19:11.051 --> 19:13.395
Wasn't that why he "murdered" Artemis?

19:13.553 --> 19:16.261
- I guess it didn't convince everyone.
- You guess?

19:16.423 --> 19:18.903
The Cave is...
Was just a place.

19:19.059 --> 19:22.063
Worth sacrificing
if it helps us stop the invasion.

19:22.228 --> 19:25.107
Look, I'm sorry
you lost all your souvenirs.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.939
Are you serious?
I don't care about that junk.

19:28.101 --> 19:31.310
I'm worried about Artemis,
terrified for her.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.678
You've put her right into his hands.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.013
Wally, we're talking about Kaldur here.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.515
I know. Kaldur, our friend...

19:39.679 --> 19:43.821
<i>who, in the space of a few months,
lost the love of his life...</i>

19:43.983 --> 19:47.487
<i>and found out Black Manta
was his father.</i>

19:47.887 --> 19:51.835
Isn't it possible Aqualad
might actually be a traitor?

19:51.991 --> 19:53.993
A triple agent?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.169
He's supposed to be playing them...

19:56.329 --> 20:00.436
but are you absolutely sure
he isn't playing you?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.470
BLACK MANTA:
Come with me.

20:33.600 --> 20:37.673
Please allow me
to officially introduce Kaldur'ahm...

20:37.837 --> 20:39.316
My son.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.385
He has succeeded in every mission
and then some.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.886
Not only did he capture Beetle
as instructed...

20:45.044 --> 20:47.149
But he acquired
two bonus Metas as well.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.854
As for the destruction of Mount Justice,
well...

20:51.017 --> 20:52.217
RA'S AL GHUL:
Indeed.

20:52.318 --> 20:55.231

20:55.388 --> 20:58.335
