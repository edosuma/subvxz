02:10.672 --> 02:12.640
Her mother is dead.

02:14.676 --> 02:18.931
You are her aunt.
I don't know what to do with her.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.067
I'll send more each month.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.835
Before you can even start to miss me...

02:40.911 --> 02:45.382
...I'm going to sail right up that river,
take you back to Africa.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.283
Girls in Africa may not wear shoes...

03:17.864 --> 03:19.537
...but French girls do.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.458
Quietly, Therese.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.958
Your father isn't coming back, Therese.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.294
He'll come back.

04:04.661 --> 04:09.588
My brother has never done a single thing
he said he was going to do.

04:17.257 --> 04:21.307
Therese, your cousin
needs his medicine.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.688
<i>God gives and he takes away.</i>

05:12.854 --> 05:17.826
He took away Camille's health,
but gave him you.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.986
You're his guardian angel.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.224
- Should you be out?
- I escaped.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.947
Kiss me, Camille.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.071
All right.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.819
No, not like that.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.454
Like this?

06:45.697 --> 06:46.823
No.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.255
Well, how?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.460
Never mind.

06:58.627 --> 07:02.803
A letter came for you from Africa.

07:05.884 --> 07:09.184
Your father went down
off the coast of Algeria.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.901
What's going to happen to me now?

07:23.068 --> 07:26.698
Well, there's the small pension
your father left you.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.207
Perhaps...

07:29.366 --> 07:32.711
Perhaps we could use that
to help find our way.

07:36.665 --> 07:40.090
Oh, my son. Oh, my God.

07:40.251 --> 07:43.926
What was I thinking?
You should be inside, it's damp out here.

07:44.089 --> 07:47.389
I'm fine. You're overreacting.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.864
Camille has an announcement
to make.

08:09.364 --> 08:12.459
- We're moving to Paris.
- Paris?

08:12.617 --> 08:15.291
- Such a filthy city.
- Yes.

08:15.453 --> 08:19.299
Through an old friend of mother's,
Inspector Michaud, I have found a job.

08:19.457 --> 08:22.586
In an office. A lowly clerk
in a big company...

08:22.752 --> 08:24.754
...being with my own little desk.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.925
- It sounds wonderful.
- Makes no sense to me whatsoever.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.345
How are we supposed
to look after you if you're gone all day?

08:31.511 --> 08:35.061
The doctor did say I should exert myself
more and you do spoil me.

08:35.222 --> 08:38.773
He's a country doctor with one dead eye.
I hardly believe he knows...

08:38.934 --> 08:40.812
I've let you coddle me all my life.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.607
The least you can do
is allow me a will of my own.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.447
It's time I take control
of our little family.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.116
Well...

08:51.781 --> 08:54.751
I've often dreamed
of having a small shop again.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.126
See? A silver lining.

08:56.286 --> 08:59.711
You know, a few special lace pieces
in the window and...

08:59.873 --> 09:02.797
You let me take care
of everything, you naughty boy.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.678
I wouldn't dream of having it
any other way, Mother.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.805
We can leave right after the wedding.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.637
Whose wedding are we going to?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.137
Well, yours, dear.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.809
Well, but who am I going to marry?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.318
Why, Camille, of course.

09:30.612 --> 09:35.834
Therese, we don't even know
who your mother was.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.081
Illegitimates have been dealt
an unlucky hand.

09:42.665 --> 09:48.172
We should consider ourselves lucky
that you have Camille.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.134
And he is so excited.

09:54.135 --> 09:58.015
Oh, and you will be
Madame Raquin, just like me.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.899
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.108
Amen.

10:56.531 --> 10:57.748
Children.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.126
This way.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.009
Set it there.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.314
"I found the most
wonderful shop," you said.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.895
I saw it in the daylight.

12:05.058 --> 12:09.234
- "An enthralling arcade"?
- But it was enthralling.

12:11.022 --> 12:15.949
Therese, let the young man pass.
He has work to do.

12:18.947 --> 12:24.750
- It's smaller than you said, Mother.
- I adore this house. It's our new home.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.960
- It's dark.
- Oh, well, be fair.

12:28.122 --> 12:31.342
It's late. When the sun streams in,
it's lovely.

12:31.501 --> 12:35.426
- It's mean.
- Oh, don't be silly.

12:37.590 --> 12:42.312
Well, I will be cooped up all day,
content in my new job at the office...

12:42.470 --> 12:45.770
...while you two girls will have each other
to thin the gloom.

12:45.932 --> 12:50.062
- Customers bustling in and out.
- Oh, yes. Won't it be exciting?

12:50.228 --> 12:53.528
Well, even I would admit,
my dear, that it needs a few touches.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.035
Well, there were
financial limitations, of course.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.240
I mean...

12:58.403 --> 13:01.873
But I think we can do wonders
with the place, really.

13:03.825 --> 13:08.046
Flowers on the windowsills
and wallpaper.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.549
Curtains, of course.
Let me show you the upstairs.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.085
Yes.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.300
- We have a generous storeroom.
- Right.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.926
<i>What do you do all day?</i>

13:55.084 --> 13:56.506
You know what I do.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.342
I don't.

13:58.504 --> 14:03.226
- Go to the office.
- And then I come home.

14:03.384 --> 14:07.605
- Are you happy?
- Not at the office.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.601
- Where?
- At the zoo.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.690
The zoo?

14:13.853 --> 14:18.324
By the end of another meaningless
column of figures, my mind is blank.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.319
It feels nice.

14:20.485 --> 14:24.615
I let my feet decide the destination
and the rest of me sort of follows along.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.955
- Your feet decide to go to the zoo?
- Well, yes.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.417
I don't know why,
but four days out of five...

14:32.121 --> 14:35.375
...I find myself outside a cage,
and I watch the bears.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.043
I see.

14:37.919 --> 14:42.140
I get to feel the ground shuddering
under my feet <i>as</i> they move about.

14:44.634 --> 14:49.481
Where's my book?
Oh, I must have left it downstairs.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.937
I'm too tired to read tonight.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.325
Hey.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.909
I might be a bear.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.160
But you're not.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.171
You're my little Therese.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.896
- Candied grapefruit peel?
- No.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.401
Camille is never this late.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.153
Mother!

15:38.604 --> 15:40.982
Finally.

15:41.149 --> 15:45.871
I'll return in a moment, and no cheating.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.655
Therese.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.331
Camille, where have you been?
You've...?

15:53.453 --> 15:54.955
I brought you a present.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.544
Imported from your
long-lost past in Vernon.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.923
You don't remember him.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.883
- Do I?
- It's Laurent.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.638
You must remember Laurent.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.471
His father owned the dairy
beyond the church.

16:07.633 --> 16:14.391
- Oh, my. Yes. Oh, my. Little Laurent.
- Yes.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.939
This is before you came to live with us.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.321
Oh, so long ago.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.241
When I was a girl,
a summer day was just...

16:23.399 --> 16:26.653
Let's not get started on summer days
or we'll die of hunger.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.494
- Can you feed this great ox?
- Well, yes, of course I can.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.125
Oh, little Laurent.
You can stay, can't you?

16:33.284 --> 16:35.002
I would love to stay, thank you.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.664
He works for the company too,
and we never knew.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.831
Oh;

16:38.998 --> 16:42.423
- I thought, "Bring him to dominoes night."
- Well, that's perfect.

16:42.585 --> 16:45.259
Thursday evenings here
are always so exciting.

16:45.421 --> 16:48.470
I mean, the banter,
especially Inspector Michaud.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.601
And his son Olivier. He's fantastic.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.728
Come, come.
You must meet everyone.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.810
Oh, I will.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.441
Therese, put the lights out, dear.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.773
Good evening.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.322
Welcome, Laurent. Olivier.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.779
- Good evening.
- My wife, Suzanne.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.535
Here you go, my friend.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.537
Inspector, very good to meet you.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.416
- Very nice.
- Well done.

17:21.290 --> 17:25.170
Would you open a window, Therese?
I keep smelling an odor like gas.

17:25.336 --> 17:28.556
- Yeah, it's probably me.
- Oh, no, certainly not.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.217
Yes. Owing to an investigation...

17:31.384 --> 17:35.730
...which I'm not at liberty to discuss,
I had to go to the morgue today.

17:36.305 --> 17:40.936
It was rather warm. The aroma clings.

17:41.102 --> 17:45.152
I seem to be having the slightest attack
of the vapors. Excuse me.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.153
- Therese.
- Don't bother, she won't be long.

17:52.947 --> 17:56.668
- Grapefruit peel?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.501
When I was a young police officer
like my son here...

18:00.663 --> 18:04.338
...I wouldn't go down to the morgue at all.
I had to draw a line.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.004
Send me into the nearest den
of thieves, unarmed.

18:08.462 --> 18:12.638
I've been to the morgue myself,
a number of times.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.854
What for? On a bet?

18:17.013 --> 18:19.516
No, no, no. Not at all.
With my artist friends.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.361
- You didn't paint, did you?
- I'm afraid I did.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.316
While my father paid my way
in the mistaken assumption...

18:27.481 --> 18:29.654
...that I was grooming myself
for the law.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.946
- Were you good?
- No, not at all, but I liked the life.

18:33.112 --> 18:37.208
- By "life" you must mean...
- He said life, he meant life.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.035
Let's leave it at that.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.498
But why the morgue?

18:40.661 --> 18:44.336
We'd stand at the public rail
with pad in hand and sketch the bodies.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.342
Wasn't there a supply
of warmer models?

18:47.501 --> 18:50.345
- Obviously not.
- So why did you hang up your brush?

18:50.546 --> 18:54.551
Well, my father
came to my garret one day...

18:55.176 --> 18:57.725
...and my model opened the door
as she was.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.811
My father was so shocked,
he took a step backwards...

19:00.973 --> 19:04.068
...and fell down three flights of steps.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.234
- Was he hurt?
- Oh, not a bit, but I was.

19:07.396 --> 19:12.027
By the time he hit bottom,
he'd cut me off completely without a sou.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.912
I haven't spoken
to the old skinflint since.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.494
You weren't prepared
to starve for your art?

19:17.657 --> 19:21.082
Do I look like a man
who would starve for his art?

19:21.243 --> 19:22.916
I couldn't say you do.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.627
No.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.678
- Therese.
- I have to open a window.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.013
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. The air is close.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.770
- Won't you join us?
- No. My head is splitting.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.478
- Laurent will think you don't like him.
- I don't.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.359
He smells like an animal.
I can smell him from here.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.284
Oh, Grivet, you've won again.

19:57.405 --> 20:00.955
I've tried, but I just can't imagine it.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.585
What?

20:02.743 --> 20:05.246
Standing there
with palette and brush in hand...

20:05.413 --> 20:07.461
...while a woman takes off her clothes.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.341
Can't you?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.469
- Therese!
- I wouldn't know where to look.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.345
There are dozens of places.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.851
- My hand would shake.
- Therese!

20:19.009 --> 20:21.182
- Should you not see...?
- Don't move.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.437
Sorry.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.941
A customer probably
wandered into the shop by mistake.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.519
I'd be hypnotized.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.233
The model is hypnotized too.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.107
Do you look at her face?

20:34.316 --> 20:36.284
And I look at her body.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.119
I listen and try to hear
what the body is saying.

20:40.281 --> 20:44.957
- "I have to go wee"?
- Yeah, maybe.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.337
The body says other things.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.300
"Love me," I suppose.

20:51.459 --> 20:55.134
The first model I ever had
was this beautiful redhead.

20:55.921 --> 20:59.516
Natural red, as I quickly discovered.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.679
With the only hitch being
that this wonderful creature...

21:02.845 --> 21:05.018
...was deaf as a brick.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.559
Couldn't call out
if I wanted adjustments.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.779
I had to mold her like a sculptor...

21:12.605 --> 21:14.699
...part by part

21:16.525 --> 21:21.702
One afternoon,
I wanted her legs to be a bit wider.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.867
So I went to move her knees apart
with my hands...

21:25.034 --> 21:27.332
...but my touch was clumsy.

21:28.537 --> 21:32.713
And then, on a hunch...

21:33.167 --> 21:35.886
...I touched the inside of her thigh...

21:36.921 --> 21:39.390
...with the tip of my brush.

21:44.678 --> 21:49.730
Where the skin
is soft as cream and warm.

21:53.187 --> 21:56.236
Lightest touch of camel's hair.

21:58.067 --> 22:01.287
Did she make the small move
you were after?

22:01.445 --> 22:03.072
She did.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.586
- And what was her body saying to you?
- “Brush me again."

22:12.081 --> 22:16.928
- Did Madame call?
- Yes, five minutes ago.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.931
Is it done?

22:21.090 --> 22:24.936
- It's a painting, Madame, not a roast.
- Great art takes time, Mother.

22:25.094 --> 22:28.348
- Just one small peek.
- Can't be done.

22:28.931 --> 22:32.231
But I could be called away to heaven
before it's completed.

22:32.393 --> 22:33.895
No, I doubt it, Madame.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.610
My guess is you'll see us
all snug in our graves.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.275
What a horrible thought.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.205
Mother, I'm posing.

22:44.905 --> 22:47.283
So handsome.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.161
Therese, now.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.750
Don't move.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.507
I've painted your shadow
into the picture.

23:03.674 --> 23:07.770
Therese, I need my hot water bottle.
My feet are freezing.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.556
Therese, honestly,
I wonder where your head is.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.733
Can you come up here, please?

23:28.657 --> 23:29.909
I look...

23:30.075 --> 23:34.171
- ls "distinguished" the word?
- It's a word.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.832
Thank you.

23:35.998 --> 23:40.674
But it barely resembles you.
It's so blue.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.848
And so gray.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.808
It resembles my soul, Mother.

23:48.594 --> 23:52.144
Is that what you were after? His soul?

23:52.306 --> 23:54.308
I paint what I see, Madame.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.690
- It does grow on one.
- So does mange.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.358
No, don't belittle yourself.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.494
You've given us a glimpse
of something...

24:07.154 --> 24:08.952
...eternal.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.832
Oh, no. Not a customer now.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.369
Let me get a bottle
of champagne to celebrate.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.957
- No, two bottles.
- Yes!

24:15.120 --> 24:17.964
Then we can come back
and marvel at Laurent's masterpiece.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.592
- But hurry.
- Of course.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.221
Marvelous.

24:28.384 --> 24:31.308
It really is an extraordinary thing.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.722
Thank you, dear friend.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.243
Do you like it?

24:48.070 --> 24:49.868
You said you couldn't paint.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.413
Unbutton your blouse.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.253
We don't have time.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.412
- Am I hurting you?
- Yes.

25:33.949 --> 25:38.921
- Don't moan.
- Don't make a sound. Keep quiet.

26:02.269 --> 26:05.148
Well, you're busy
as a little bee this morning.

26:05.314 --> 26:08.113
I slept very well last night.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.843
There?

26:32.508 --> 26:34.727
Show me where.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.892
Show me where.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.771
There. Right there?

26:48.107 --> 26:50.951
- Tomorrow. Don't be late.
- Yes.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.959
Therese, I need you.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.071
Well, we'll save them both for you...

27:32.234 --> 27:35.238
...and you can stop in
once you've given it some thought.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.907
Oh, that's what I'll do. Thank you.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.432
Jesus, Camille,
you scared the hell out of me.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.895
Will you join me for some lunch?
It's not a difficult question.

28:03.056 --> 28:06.185
I'm sorry. The head clerk needs me
to run an errand for him.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.523
I'll see you tonight?

28:07.686 --> 28:09.359
- Tonight?
- It's Thursday.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.944
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
I'll see you tonight.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.905
I'm sorry, I'm late, Camille.

28:14.526 --> 28:18.030
Come over whenever you want.
You're family now.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.060
Your marriage bed?

28:44.223 --> 28:46.317
Madame could come up here
at any minute.

28:46.475 --> 28:49.024
She wouldn't dream
of leaving the shop.

28:49.186 --> 28:53.066
Besides, I have a terrible headache
and need to rest.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.993
You're afraid.

29:07.621 --> 29:13.845
I can't believe that you're the same
lifeless girl who always sat in the corner.

29:15.087 --> 29:18.842
You have no idea
how much they've stolen from me.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.431
I almost ran away twice...

29:22.594 --> 29:25.723
...but she always told me
I couldn't survive without them.

29:27.224 --> 29:29.272
And I believed her.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.687
There is nothing left of me...

29:33.146 --> 29:39.153
...but a bit of burnt wick
and a wisp of smoke.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.448
And look at you now.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.830
So don't be afraid.

29:45.993 --> 29:50.920
Danger passes by those
who look it right in the eye.

29:57.212 --> 30:02.969
He still had her blood under
his fingernails when we found him.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.472
Excuse me.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.442
- Therese.
- She won't be long.

30:10.600 --> 30:14.400
Thou shalt not.
Is it the sixth or the seventh?

30:14.563 --> 30:18.784
- The seventh.
- The sixth and the seventh.

30:18.942 --> 30:22.162
There is nothing but murder and lust.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.746
To be stuffed into her own oven...

30:28.577 --> 30:31.421
Hacked to bloody pieces
and baked in a pie.

30:32.706 --> 30:35.255
Therese, it's your move.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.100
Oh, now.

30:44.593 --> 30:47.597
I had no idea you were such
a skillful player, Therese.

30:47.763 --> 30:52.018
It's always the quiet ones in the corner
that you have to keep an eye on.

30:58.023 --> 31:01.118
- I can't stand not being with you.
- Therese!

31:01.276 --> 31:03.119
Oh, for God's sake.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.530
Therese, are you ill?

31:04.696 --> 31:07.449
I have a terrible migraine, Madame.

31:07.616 --> 31:13.794
- Well, would you like a cup of tea?
- Maybe later. I need to rest.

31:19.878 --> 31:24.475
- You like to lie.
- I do, and I'm good at it.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.182
They made me good.

31:27.344 --> 31:30.393
Thank you for locking me up
in a sickroom.

31:31.640 --> 31:36.362
And thank you for burying me alive.
Oh, thank you.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.648
Oh, thank you.

31:44.986 --> 31:48.581
Therese, is the cat
coughing up fur balls again?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.674
What's wrong?

32:07.676 --> 32:10.145
You dug me up too late.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.269
No.

32:14.516 --> 32:17.019
No, just in time.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.778
Just in time.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.368
Save me.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.330
Please save me.

33:01.062 --> 33:04.566
I was sinking. I was sinking
into something cold and deep.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.735
I couldn't breathe.

33:06.902 --> 33:08.654
You were dreaming.

33:13.366 --> 33:16.540
- What are you doing?
- Listening to the river.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.839
That's just a brick wall, Therese.

33:23.585 --> 33:28.466
- Do you often sit up alone at night?
- Sometimes.

33:29.508 --> 33:34.184
You have secrets from me.
I didn't know.

33:35.889 --> 33:40.770
Sometimes at night
I sit up at the window. That's all.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.438
Come back to bed.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.574
I want to hold you.
I never dream when I hold you.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.461
I hated you.

33:59.329 --> 34:01.127
You hated me?

34:05.752 --> 34:08.426
Before you ever touched me.

34:09.714 --> 34:15.312
I used to walk into a room
and I'd see you there.

34:15.469 --> 34:18.518
And you'd barely look up.

34:19.391 --> 34:23.987
I'd find myself moving around
and around your chair...

34:24.145 --> 34:29.493
...hoping that a small part of my dress...

34:29.650 --> 34:31.779
...or my hand might touch you.

34:35.322 --> 34:36.745
Do you still hate me?

34:38.659 --> 34:40.503
Yes.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.164
Why?

34:43.164 --> 34:45.507
Because you can leave me.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.175
But I won't.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.726
I promise.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.514
I promise.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.069
I promise.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.489
Camille, what are we doing?

35:09.357 --> 35:12.736
- Come to see my bear.
- Why?

35:13.403 --> 35:15.451
Last week,
there was a young boy here...

35:15.614 --> 35:18.117
...with a crust of bread
he'd spread with honey.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.331
He threw it, but his aim was bad.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.962
It hit the bear on the back
and it stuck there.

35:23.371 --> 35:26.966
Poor thing could smell the honey,
but he couldn't quite reach it.

35:29.044 --> 35:33.550
The bear went crazy.
The poor thing mauled itself.

35:34.758 --> 35:39.309
Why dwell on it? It's sad.
Come on, let's go.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.891
I don't know
how to make Therese happy.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.488
Isn't she happy?

35:51.191 --> 35:53.410
I don't even know how to tell anymore.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.663
Just love her, Camille.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.921
It just seemed so much easier
back in Vernon.

36:05.914 --> 36:10.169
Just love her.
See if she comes around.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.012
Come on, let's go.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.475
I want to fall asleep in your arms.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.347
I wish that could happen.

37:05.098 --> 37:08.352
I want to touch your body
while you sleep.

37:09.853 --> 37:13.949
I want to wake up
with your tongue inside me.

37:14.107 --> 37:15.450
Therese.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.656
Therese, I made you
some chamomile tea.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.493
Oh, my God. Get under my skirts.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.913
Therese?

37:24.075 --> 37:25.497
- Open your legs.
- No.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.004
- I can't breathe.
- I don't care.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.424
Were you dozing, dear?

37:31.583 --> 37:35.133
- I thought I heard you muttering.
- Maybe I was. I don't remember.

37:35.295 --> 37:38.014
- Tea?
- Yes, please.

37:38.173 --> 37:42.644
- How's your head? Still agonizing?
- It comes and goes.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.725
Perhaps I should rub your neck.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.890
Oh, you know, I don't think that's...

37:47.056 --> 37:49.434
Oh, it always helped
when you were small.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.646
You know, you've had
so many headaches lately.

37:52.812 --> 37:55.736
Perhaps we should talk to the doctor.

37:55.899 --> 37:59.529
I need you by my side, dear,
down in the shop.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.472
- Is that better?
- Oh, yes.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.009
Thank you.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.398
You should start getting
packing material from Fragnet's shop.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.562
What for?

38:37.190 --> 38:38.692
We're moving back to Vernon.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.288
What?

38:44.447 --> 38:48.873
Paris is so bad for my health.
All the filth and soot.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.588
But your job, the shop?

38:53.289 --> 38:55.917
Both easily replaced in Vernon.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.883
Camille. Camille.

39:01.089 --> 39:03.467
When were you going
to discuss this with me?

39:03.633 --> 39:05.431
I like Paris.

39:06.219 --> 39:09.849
Mother says you've been getting
terrible migraines every afternoon...

39:10.014 --> 39:11.607
...so it's better for you too.

39:11.766 --> 39:15.737
- The air is much cleaner in Vernon.
- What's gotten into you?

39:17.605 --> 39:21.576
I'm the husband. I make the decisions.

39:21.734 --> 39:25.034
Yeah, but we have friends here
and our business.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.493
Therese.

39:26.656 --> 39:30.877
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.795
We will live out our lives together
away from this filthy city...

39:35.957 --> 39:37.334
...and all will be fine.

39:48.469 --> 39:51.473
Therese, it's time for bed.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.982
- Therese?
- Yes.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.071
What are you doing?

40:03.902 --> 40:08.829
- Checking that the door is locked.
- Go to bed this instant. It's late.

40:23.713 --> 40:26.136
Good evening, Monsieur Janoux.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.858
Oh, I can't live without you any longer.

40:51.699 --> 40:56.330
- If only he'd go away...
- Well, people don't just go away.

40:56.496 --> 40:58.715
Sometimes they do.

41:02.627 --> 41:06.302
But it's dangerous...

41:08.341 --> 41:10.810
...for the people they leave behind.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.557
Not if the going away is an accident.

41:17.725 --> 41:21.355
People have accidents every day...

41:22.188 --> 41:25.909
...and sometimes
they just don't come back.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.410
That's all.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.424
I have to go.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.091
Therese.

41:48.548 --> 41:49.765
Do I own you?

41:52.760 --> 41:54.603
Completely.

41:57.056 --> 41:58.273
Do I own you?

42:00.601 --> 42:04.481
Yes. Yes.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.558
For you.

42:41.309 --> 42:43.937
They're supposed
to go into water, Therese.

42:44.103 --> 42:47.653
Oh, and don't tell Mother.
She'll be jealous.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.673
Feels like summer's nearly over.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.334
The leaves will be falling
before we know it.

43:06.501 --> 43:08.094
Why does that happen?

43:08.252 --> 43:09.925
Listen.

43:10.088 --> 43:13.342
- What?
- I hear water.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.476
Maybe it's the leaves drifting down.

43:15.635 --> 43:19.765
It's the river,
beyond those trees over there.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.684
Why don't we rent a boat
and row out into the sunset?

43:22.850 --> 43:25.945
Just let me sit down for a moment.

43:27.146 --> 43:30.525
- Are you tired?
- Oh, I'm exhausted.

43:30.691 --> 43:32.864
I couldn't have trudged another step.

43:33.027 --> 43:36.406
Just let me catch up
with a couple of winks.

43:36.572 --> 43:38.074
Therese.

43:41.494 --> 43:42.620
Notice this, Laurent.

43:44.205 --> 43:47.709
If you get married, you'll find yourself
with a portable pillow.

43:47.875 --> 43:51.129
Don't flaunt your good fortune,
my friend.

43:51.963 --> 43:56.890
- Oh, we must have walked 20 miles.
- Maybe two.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.429
I'm getting old.

44:01.556 --> 44:03.558
What an odd thought.

44:12.567 --> 44:13.739
Are you warm enough?

44:16.737 --> 44:18.205
Camille.

44:20.741 --> 44:21.867
Camille.

44:26.539 --> 44:28.883
- Don't.
- I have to touch you.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.613
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

44:50.771 --> 44:54.116
No, you don't know.
There, clomping through the leaves.

44:54.984 --> 44:59.455
- Isn't that Therese?
- Oh, look, Laurent, Therese.

44:59.614 --> 45:01.537
Laurent!

45:05.286 --> 45:07.414
Oh, sorry.

45:07.580 --> 45:10.129
- Is he sick?
- Oh, no. He's napping.

45:10.625 --> 45:13.219
On the damp ground?
His mother would have a heart attack.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.463
I won't tell if you won't.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.219
What happened to your foot?

45:18.382 --> 45:21.226
- Oh, a blister.
- I got one too.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.262
I told you this walk was too far.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.727
Well, we're leaving now,
aren't we, darling?

45:25.890 --> 45:29.315
Without doing the single thing
we came to do.

45:29.477 --> 45:31.479
If you want to rent a boat, Suzanne...

45:31.646 --> 45:34.490
...and row out into the fading light,
be my guest.

45:34.649 --> 45:37.368
I'm going home. Good afternoon.

45:37.526 --> 45:39.654
Can I tell you something, Therese?

45:40.238 --> 45:42.991
All men are pigs.

45:43.783 --> 45:46.002
Why can't you two
be civil to one another?

45:46.160 --> 45:48.254
- She wants to go on a boat.
- Wait.

45:48.621 --> 45:50.999
She wants to go on a boat.
Last time...

45:51.165 --> 45:54.089
- ...you knocked the oar into the water.
- Olivier, wait. Wait for me!

45:54.252 --> 45:57.631
- Will you control your temper?
- Have a good afternoon.

45:57.797 --> 46:00.346
Might have been able to go on a boat
this summer.

46:00.508 --> 46:03.637
But somebody was taking their time
choosing the right dress.

46:03.803 --> 46:07.228
Let's have a lovely walk by the river.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.234
We should go.

46:10.393 --> 46:12.020
- Where?
- Back.

46:14.730 --> 46:15.856
To what?

46:21.696 --> 46:23.539
- I'd never make a sailor.
- Easy.

46:23.698 --> 46:25.621
I'm terrified of water.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.535
Don't be such a baby.

46:27.702 --> 46:30.080
If God had intended us
to conquer the waves...

46:30.246 --> 46:32.715
...he'd have fitted us
with pontoons, not feet.

46:32.873 --> 46:35.467
Just sit down. Don't stand in the boat.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.128
Sit.

46:42.758 --> 46:47.138
When we were little, remember, Therese,
you'd make me play that game?

46:47.305 --> 46:48.852
Remember?

46:49.015 --> 46:51.564
We'd sit in our room
and the sun would go down...

46:51.726 --> 46:55.401
...and you'd say,
“Don't light a candle yet."

46:55.980 --> 46:57.402
The light would fade...

46:57.857 --> 47:00.906
...but we could still just make out
things in the room...

47:01.068 --> 47:02.945
...the table, the rug, the vase.

47:03.112 --> 47:05.456
Then they lost their color.

47:05.614 --> 47:06.831
Then their edges.

47:08.409 --> 47:09.456
Therese?

47:09.618 --> 47:12.337
- When it was completely dark...
- Get in the boat.

47:12.496 --> 47:17.002
...it'd feel like there was almost
someone else with us there in the room.

47:17.168 --> 47:21.844
I'd want to strike a match,
but you called me a baby. Remember?

47:22.006 --> 47:23.849
I love you.

47:27.053 --> 47:31.900
Well, at least I'm not afraid of boats,
like some babies I could mention.

48:21.482 --> 48:26.158
Is there anything as depressingly calm
as a Sunday afternoon?

49:26.338 --> 49:28.136
- Camille!
- Man over!

49:28.299 --> 49:31.178
Camille! I have to go back in!

49:31.343 --> 49:34.472
- Laurent!
- Camille? Laurent.

49:35.389 --> 49:36.515
Oh, my goodness.

49:36.682 --> 49:38.480
My dear, what's wrong?

49:38.642 --> 49:43.239
- No! No!
- We have to find him! Camille! Camille!

49:43.397 --> 49:45.274
Oh, my God!

49:50.654 --> 49:53.328
Get him up. Help him up.

49:53.699 --> 49:57.329
No! No!

50:05.419 --> 50:08.263
I told him to stop dancing around
in the boat.

50:09.423 --> 50:11.517
I told him.

50:11.675 --> 50:14.269
And then the boat tipped over.

50:14.428 --> 50:16.931
You did all that was humanly possible.

50:17.097 --> 50:18.724
She's got a fever.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.444
He kept shouting, "Save my Therese."

50:24.480 --> 50:27.734
You die just like that,
in the twinkle of an eye.

50:27.900 --> 50:29.618
Horrible, just horrible.

50:30.611 --> 50:33.114
A report will have to be filed.

50:33.280 --> 50:38.127
Certainly someone saw something,
and they will find the body.

50:46.335 --> 50:49.384
No, wait here. You've been
through enough today, dear boy.

50:49.547 --> 50:51.595
We'll take over now.

51:04.895 --> 51:07.148
I should go to Madame.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.793
We have a long way to go.

51:21.287 --> 51:26.509
- You can never leave me now.
- Be strong.

51:33.841 --> 51:36.014
I think you should come in now.

51:37.177 --> 51:40.522
No, no, no!

51:42.057 --> 51:44.560
No, no!

51:53.444 --> 51:56.948
Therese, Madame needs you now.

51:58.407 --> 52:00.330
Oh, no. Oh, no.

52:03.037 --> 52:06.257
Where's my boy? Where's my boy?

52:09.168 --> 52:12.547
No, no, no!

52:19.178 --> 52:22.728
Oh, no, no, no.

52:23.557 --> 52:27.903
My boy! Where's my boy?

52:28.062 --> 52:30.736
Oh, no!

53:43.095 --> 53:44.472
Amen.

53:44.763 --> 53:46.310
Amen.

53:50.644 --> 53:54.319
I'm so sorry, Madame. I'm so sorry.

54:00.779 --> 54:03.077
I'd do it all again if I had to.

54:04.825 --> 54:06.327
I love you.

55:26.198 --> 55:30.294
- Therese, please, let me do it.
- No, I want to keep busy.

55:41.255 --> 55:45.510
I see him sometimes,
breaking the surface.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.599
Have some tea, Madame.

55:47.761 --> 55:51.891
Swelling and bursting apart.

55:52.933 --> 55:55.311
Madame, I beg you.

55:55.686 --> 55:57.859
And other times...

56:05.779 --> 56:09.955
Other times, I see the boat tipping...

56:10.117 --> 56:12.461
...and I see him falling.

56:14.288 --> 56:17.633
And then I see him swimming away.

56:18.125 --> 56:22.972
Flopping up onto a bank,
exhausted but happy.

56:24.464 --> 56:28.219
And I wonder, "Why...

56:28.802 --> 56:30.975
...couldn't it be that way?"

56:37.978 --> 56:39.480
Tea, Madame.

56:41.148 --> 56:43.867
Have my son bring it to me.

57:01.418 --> 57:02.795
Therese...

57:08.800 --> 57:11.804
Madame, you should come inside.

57:21.313 --> 57:24.658
- You did this.
- No, I don't know what you mean.

57:24.816 --> 57:28.662
You... You took your eyes off of him.
You weren't watching.

57:28.820 --> 57:31.664
You were supposed to be
his guardian angel.

57:31.823 --> 57:33.700
Madame, accidents happen every day.

57:33.867 --> 57:39.670
When the boat tipped over,
how did you survive?

57:39.831 --> 57:45.838
How did you survive while my child
sank down into the blackness?

57:46.004 --> 57:51.352
What were you doing? Tell me, tell me.
Oh, God, tell me. What were you doing?

57:51.510 --> 57:54.855
- Madame, I tried.
- No, you didn't.

57:56.014 --> 57:58.517
You let him die.

57:59.518 --> 58:04.194
How'd you manage to live
and not him?

58:05.607 --> 58:07.530
H Ow?

58:07.693 --> 58:11.038
He should be standing
right here beside me.

58:11.196 --> 58:17.078
Not you, not you, not you! Not you!

58:19.579 --> 58:21.581
NOI you!

58:28.463 --> 58:30.136
Madame.

58:37.472 --> 58:41.272
Therese. Oh, my baby girl.

58:41.643 --> 58:45.739
I didn't mean those things I said.
I didn't mean...

58:46.314 --> 58:51.320
Something has reached inside me...

58:51.486 --> 58:55.332
...and destroyed my heart and my mind.

58:57.659 --> 59:00.333
Oh, my sweet girl.

59:47.334 --> 59:49.678
Is she sleeping?

59:51.296 --> 59:52.673
Yes.

59:53.507 --> 59:55.680
Perhaps we should leave.

59:56.843 --> 59:58.595
Please stay.

59:59.679 --> 01:00:05.686
We... We weren't sure whether
to come here even after you invited us.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:09.026
But it's been so long
and we've missed your at-homes.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:13.365
Well, she's missed them too.
Please, stay.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.132
I had to be near you.

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.214
Near whom, Therese?
Did you say something?

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:35.014
No, Mother.
You must have been dreaming.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:43.853
How long does it take to drown?

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.404
To sink down into the murk, how long?

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:55.069
- It's very late.
- We've worn you down.

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:57.237
Oh, no, no.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:02.831
I'm thankful for that.
And please do come again soon.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:09.000
Madame, you must try not to imagine
Camille in bits and pieces.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.220
How should I imagine him?

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:17.011
Gone, just gone.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.510
Gone?

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:23.017
We'll see ourselves out.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.023
Just go.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:35.776
If I make grief an inconvenience...

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:38.786
Perhaps it pains them
to see you suffer.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:42.449
- You have a kind heart.
- Oh, it's nothing, Madame.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.289
No.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:50.207
No, it's not nothing.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:54.378
It's comfort, Laurent,
and you give it gladly.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.805
- Lock up the shop as you leave.
- Of course.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.990
Therese, I need you.

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:28.680
Don't ever do that to me again.

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:33.023
Therese, I can't sleep.
I haven't slept in months.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:38.532
- Let me come to your room tonight.
- No. No, we have to wait.

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:45.868
- Why did we kill him?
- To be together.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:47.248
Exactly.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:55.048
I can't sleep.
I keep having nightmares about it.

01:03:55.707 --> 01:04:01.214
Darling, as soon as we're married
and sleep in the same bed together...

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:05.384
- ...all of the nightmares will stop.
- Let's just leave. We'll leave tonight.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:07.723
- I don't care where we go.
- Therese, stop.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:11.607
If we left right now,
we'd go straight to the guillotine. Soon.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:16.645
- We'll have each other and the shop.
- Oh, I don't care about the shop.

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:20.315
Well, you should care about the shop.
It's yours now.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:23.326
I don't know, Laurent.
Everything is in her name.

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:26.329
Nothing was in his name,
not even a bank account.

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:29.833
- What?
- Yes. Nothing.

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:37.711
Can you grieve a little more?

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:44.965
Therese, have you made any tea?

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:53.015
Therese, what is that sound?

01:04:55.683 --> 01:04:57.356
Therese?

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:02.858
Therese?

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:12.329
- Suzanne.
- My, you scared me.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:15.996
Just making sure
all the doors were locked up tight.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:19.170
I never realized
the shop had a side door.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:23.011
Both doors are secure.

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:27.598
It's heartbreaking. Just heartbreaking.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.636
- Perhaps we should just let them be.
- I should help...

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:34.682
It's a beautiful evening.
Let me walk you home.

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.686
We'll take the long way.

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:42.815
Yes.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:50.072
- How sick is Therese?
- I beg your pardon?

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:53.037
She's as white as a slab of marble,
Madame.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:57.500
Her eyes are empty, her skin is dull,
and either she's sick as a dog or...

01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:58.709
Or what?

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:01.341
Or she's sicker of lying alone
in an empty bed.

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:04.378
- Father.
- Well, wouldn't you be?

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:07.555
I only wonder
if anyone even remembers.

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:09.674
Remembers what, Madame?

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:15.723
That I had a son
who died just eight months ago.

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:19.860
- But shouldn't Therese move on?
- Oh, well, of course she should.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:28.319
I don't... I don't know.
It's as if she's fading away.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.362
I've seen many things in my life...

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:33.031
...and I can tell you
with absolute certainty...

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:35.326
...that woman
is dying of a broken heart.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:39.087
From a bleeding wound
that never heals.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:44.001
- Marriage is the cure.
- Marriage?

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:51.842
No. Oh, no, no, no.
That's not possible, no.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:57.849
- Who would she marry?
- Well, who else but Laurent?

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:00.980
Laurent.

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:10.114
More respectful to Camille's memory
than were she to marry a stranger.

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.946
A stranger.

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:17.792
Oh, no. No.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:21.212
No, not a stranger.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:28.466
Not at this late chapter in my life.
A stranger?

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.303
They're watching us.

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:48.278
- Do you miss me?
- Yes.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.740
That's not very convincing.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.748
Well, sometimes at night when I'm afraid,
I miss you then.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:08:00.661
- Only sometimes?
- Well, sometimes...

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:05.628
...I lie in my great big bed completely
alone for the first time in my life...

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:08.293
...and I feel like a little girl again.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:14.804
Well, once we're married,
it'll be like it used to be.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:18.223
Have you taken a mistress?

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:22.640
No.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.651
I can smell her from here.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:30.319
What does she look like?

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:39.707
- She looks like you, but it's over.
- Really? Why?

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:41.834
Because I couldn't
remember her name.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:45.042
I'd be dreaming
and I'd whisper your name in her ear.

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:47.673
- Does she have red hair?
- Therese...

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:55.679
With the love and support
of our dear friends...

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.015
- ...I'm ready to discuss your marriage.
- Marriage, Mother?

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:02.680
But to whom?

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:07.401
But I love Laurent as a brother.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:12.282
I happily accept, Madame,
if Therese will have me.

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:23.618
Camille slipped from these hands.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:27.417
I will never let that happen to you.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.126
Ever.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.790
<i>Since Therese is the fast of our family“...</i>

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:16.134
<i>...I have decided to change my will
and put it in both of your names.</i>

01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:24.434
Upon my passing, you will receive
the shop and 20,000 francs.

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:29.275
Well, it's hardly a fortune,
but it'll be yours.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:34.985
Bound by a tie
more powerful than love, money.

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:37.401
Shall we go celebrate?

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.548
Madame's really outdone herself
with our room.

01:10:56.711 --> 01:11:00.887
New sheets, fresh flowers.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.179
Therese.

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.482
- Madame has...
- Take it down.

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:15.771
It's only a painting.

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:18.942
If it's only a painting,
why are we whispering?

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.540
That scar on your neck.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:36.209
- It was bright red today at the church.
- Was it?

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.171
- How did you...?
- Don't.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:50.690
We've dreamt of this moment for so long
and now the dream's come true.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:56.734
Remember you said that
you wanted to fall asleep in my arms...

01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:59.399
...and wake up
with me warm beside you?

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:01.735
Did I?

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:06.080
Yes. And now we can.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:09.910
- Now that Camille is gone...
- Oh, no. Why did you say his name?

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:12.579
- What? You say it.
- Oh, I can't.

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:13.917
Therese, say it.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:21.588
- Camille.
- See? What happened?

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:24.841
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.509
Why?

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:31.022
Because he's gone. He's dead.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:35.185
Camille? Camille?

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.900
How badly did he die?

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:55.379
You didn't see?

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.542
I closed my eyes.

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:02.049
When?

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:05.135
Hey, stop it. You're tickling me. No!

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:12.222
I was gentle, Therese.

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:16.810
I lowered him into the water
like it was a bath.

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.978
Show me how.

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:27.115
- He didn't fight?
- No, he was quiet like it was bath time.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.280
Show me.

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:39.124
Don't lie to me.
He didn't go gently, did he?

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:41.509
I closed my eyes.
I couldn't close my ears.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:44.511
I heard him call my name. "Therese!"

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:48.850
Therese! Therese!

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:51.351
- "Therese!"
- Stop it!

01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:00.694
Stop it.

01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:43.521
Do you know what tonight is?

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:47.024
I'd almost forgotten.

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:52.412
It's our wedding night.

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:59.371
We were married the moment
I stepped into that boat.

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:15.307
Madame.

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:20.976
Oh, perhaps Therese
might like a ginger biscuit.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:26.484
Every afternoon since the wedding.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.324
I'm not much for napping myself.

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:49.637
- Do you like the chicken?
- Yes. Thank you for bringing me lunch.

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:55.974
Lunchtime used to mean
something very different for us.

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:02.349
We're settling in.

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:05.478
I have to get back to work.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.906
- Mother.
- When I was a girl, a summer's day...

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:16.414
- Oh, there she goes again.
- Tell us about a summer's day.

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.626
I babble on and on and on...

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.005
...as I drift away.

01:16:26.999 --> 01:16:29.343
How long will it take?

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:34.011
I think I shall turn...

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:38.177
...and see someone I knew.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:43.858
Someone I loved.

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:52.029
A summer's day, spun out like...

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.862
...sugar...

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:02.293
...spun white.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:11.211
- What spun? What?
- You said a day.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:15.473
We thought the cowpats
were stepping-stones...

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:20.182
...and my sister, Amalie,
stepped on one.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:24.144
And screamed again,
and I laughed so hard, I thought...

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.684
<i>Mother.</i>

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:43.042
Madame? Laurent!

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:46.921
- Madame?
- Mother.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:51.171
<i>Try</i> to get her <i>to move unassisted
as often as possible.</i>

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.677
- The smallest movement will help.
- Certainly.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:56.840
And encourage her to talk,
even moan a little.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:59.680
The slightest sound
may help her regain her speech.

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:03.267
- So how can she be able to...?
- You know...

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:07.434
...she's very lucky to have the two of you
to watch over her.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.446
- Good night.
- Good night, doctor.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:17.118
We're all alone now.

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:06.041
Carry her down to the shop
before you leave.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.792
All right.

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.295
Ready, Mother?

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.679
All right.

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:36.443
You need both of our signatures
to get the money.

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:41.152
- Good morning!
- We'll be right down.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:52.709
- Laurent, time to go home.
- Yeah. Just finishing up.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:16.191
You should learn how to cook.

01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:20.532
You should learn how to eat.

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:23.035
If only I was more like Camille...

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:32.211
Well, it's getting late, isn't it?
You should be in bed.

01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:42.380
I don't know who you are sometimes.

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:48.059
Till death do us part, dear.

01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:58.237
- Therese!
- What?

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:01.398
Stop the ticking.

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:05.445
The ticking is the only thing
that drowns you out.

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:13.794
- I'm not saying a word.
- You are. I can hear you.

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:17.749
- What am I saying?
- Exactly what I'm saying.

01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:20.505
You're not saying anything.

01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:23.841
The boat, the afternoon.

01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:27.850
- The sun going down, the fog...
- Shut up. Come here, come here!

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:31.433
The shore is gone, the boat is drifting.

01:21:33.514 --> 01:21:37.519
- We're all alone. He sees my face.
- He starts to shout.

01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:39.778
- I grab his throat.
- “Therese!"

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:41.985
I lift him up and he bites my neck.

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.608
- He screams your name.
- “Therese!"

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:47.654
- I heave him in!
- "Therese!"

01:21:51.865 --> 01:21:53.287
And then he's gone.

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:56.870
That's right, he's gone.

01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:00.882
- You killed him.
- What?

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:04.378
Liar! You liar! Liar!

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:08.341
You wanted him dead!
You begged me to kill him!

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:11.807
- We killed him!
- Then why does he only haunt you?

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:16.270
Are you out of your mind?
You know he comes to you every night.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.686
He slithers into your dreams,
and you wake up screaming.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:25.200
I scream because you hold on too tight
and your nails bite into my skin!

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.708
Oh, God.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:07.154
Go ahead, say something.

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.653
Spit in my face.

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:14.240
Tell me to go to hell.

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:18.377
Where do you think you are now?

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:25.960
Therese!

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:28.424
Therese, where are you going?
Get over here.

01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:30.715
- Let go of me!
- What are you doing?

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:37.781
Tea, Madame?

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:43.503
Six or the two?

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:53.013
Oh, I see. She sparkles at the six
and won't look at the two, so six.

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:58.643
Simple.
My mind over her dead matter.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:02.310
- Then what is she writing?
- Beg your pardon?

01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:08.320
While you were going on,
her fingers were tracing letters. Watch.

01:25:16.153 --> 01:25:17.530
Start over again, Madame.

01:25:24.995 --> 01:25:27.214
- What's that look like?
- I don't know.

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:28.965
- It's a T.
- It's a T, isn't it?

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.546
- Isn't that a T?
- Yeah.

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:38.346
L-I-

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:42.680
- E, "The." The something.
- The...

01:25:42.846 --> 01:25:45.520
- Let me see.
- Darling, just a minute.

01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:47.684
R-

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.897
- E.
- E.

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:55.819
- "There but for the grace..."
- Shut up, Grivet.

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.076
What's the next one?

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:02.074
- S. Is that an S?
- It's an S. That is an S.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.083
- E.
- E. "Therese."

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:06.244
- E. "Therese."
- Thank you, professor.

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.288
She's written "Therese."

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:11.717
"Therese..."

01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:17.214
- "Therese..."
- “And..."

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.554
- "Therese and..."
- “Therese and Laurent!"

01:26:19.716 --> 01:26:22.344
That's what she's written,
"Therese and Laurent."

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:25.806
"Therese and Laurent."

01:26:25.972 --> 01:26:27.019
- A.
- A.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:28.855
A-

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:31.896
- R.
- R.

01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:40.613
- E.
- E. "Therese and Laurent are..."

01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:42.452
What, Madame?

01:26:57.003 --> 01:27:01.008
- She's tired herself.
- No need for her to finish.

01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:03.268
Just look in her eyes.

01:27:03.427 --> 01:27:06.101
"Therese and Laurent are...

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:10.689
...wonderful children
who treat me very well."

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:12.819
Am I right?

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:16.736
- Why is she crying?
- Gratitude.

01:27:17.023 --> 01:27:19.651
No, Mother.

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:22.321
We are the ones
that are grateful to you.

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:34.542
- To the perfect couple.
- Yes.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:38.133
This is a happy home.
Good people live here.

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.194
Are those headaches back?

01:27:58.023 --> 01:28:00.025
I can't take it.

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:06.782
The two of you can't fool me
for another moment.

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:14.124
I predict an addition to this little family
in eight months.

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:19.295
No, Suzanne, I'm...
No, I'm certain. That's not it.

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:42.985
Thank you.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.655
Thank you.

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:54.876
I'm going to go lie down.
My head is throbbing.

01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:57.878
I'll listen for the bell.

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:29.114
I forgot my buttons.

01:29:47.591 --> 01:29:51.767
I've changed my mind.
I have to get out of here.

01:29:59.144 --> 01:30:00.987
Go ahead.

01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:08.157
Might bore a hole right through me.
Right here.

01:30:09.988 --> 01:30:12.832
Who sold me into marriage?

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:18.998
Who would do anything
to keep from being alone?

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:22.251
You.

01:31:11.091 --> 01:31:15.187
Drink up. It's time to go.
The bar closed half an hour ago.

01:31:15.345 --> 01:31:17.689
- Sorry, darling.
- No, don't leave.

01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:19.690
Well, we can't stay here.

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:23.524
- Don't leave. Don't leave. Please stay.
- I'm sorry, darling.

01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:35.540
No, please stay.

01:31:36.032 --> 01:31:38.034
You must stay.

01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:42.038
Can I buy you a drink?

01:31:47.377 --> 01:31:49.050
I have one.

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:50.801
Can I buy you?

01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:54.927
I'm free.

01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:04.319
Get up on this table.
Come on. Lift your skirt.

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.690
For what?

01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:14.495
Come on, you'll see.

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.203
This will make it all better.

01:32:23.163 --> 01:32:25.837
- Hang on.
- Go on. Yeah.

01:32:25.999 --> 01:32:28.297
One second. Hold on.

01:32:32.172 --> 01:32:34.300
I don't want you.

01:33:05.163 --> 01:33:08.167
Prussic acid. Quick as lightning.

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:12.008
Tiniest drop,
you'll never see those rats again.

01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:15.848
Have a good morning.

01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:23.519
Laurent?

01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:29.025
Laurent, come and get her.

01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:18.654
Hello?

01:34:25.618 --> 01:34:27.245
Hello?

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:32.834
Madame?

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:34.840
Hello?

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:52.103
We'll be right down, Suzanne.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:57.192
Careful!

01:34:58.735 --> 01:35:00.408
Suzanne?

01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:23.135
I loved your son. Please.

01:35:24.636 --> 01:35:29.312
And if you could forgive me,
I'd kill myself and end in peace.

01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:33.403
Please, do you forgive me?

01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:37.448
Do you forgive...? Do you forgive me?

01:35:38.983 --> 01:35:41.031
- Get off the? oor.
- Forgive me, please.

01:35:41.194 --> 01:35:42.867
- Oh, get off the? oor!
- Please.

01:35:43.029 --> 01:35:45.452
Yes, she forgives you! Look!
She forgives you!

01:35:45.615 --> 01:35:50.963
She wishes that she had a dozen children
so you could kill them all <i>as</i> well!

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.333
- They've come for us, Therese.
- I'm sorry.

01:35:54.499 --> 01:35:55.967
Go see who it is.

01:35:56.834 --> 01:35:58.177
I want this over.

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:02.807
Therese, go see who it is. Go!

01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:04.639
Go!

01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:23.995
May I help you, sir?

01:36:25.321 --> 01:36:28.621
- Olivier.
- I didn't hear you come down.

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:33.835
- Is Suzanne with you?
- No. No, I was just passing by.

01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:37.672
- We haven't seen you in so long.
- I know. Madame has been very ill.

01:36:37.834 --> 01:36:40.508
- May I say hello to her?
- She's sound asleep.

01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:45.016
- I'll tell her you stopped in.
- Yes, let her know that we send our best.

01:36:47.176 --> 01:36:50.180
Hopefully we'll start
our Thursday evenings very soon.

01:36:50.346 --> 01:36:54.522
- She misses them so much.
- As do we.

01:36:54.851 --> 01:36:56.853
Olivier.

01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:02.408
Your hat.

01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:12.043
Have a good morning.

01:37:43.858 --> 01:37:47.829
Oh, no. The shop is completely empty.
It's been abandoned.

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:52.250
This way? The river.
They were headed this way.

01:38:10.802 --> 01:38:14.397
- Did you ever love me?
- Yes.

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:18.647
When he was alive.

01:38:20.144 --> 01:38:21.817
I love you.

01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:26.655
- After I killed him...
- We killed him.

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:39.001
- Do you want some wine?
- Yes.

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:21.338
I want to kiss you.

01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:25.460
From your neck to your thigh.

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:30.802
- Put my tongue inside...
- We did all that.

01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:52.908
Do it.

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:56.825
No.

01:39:57.825 --> 01:39:59.042
You.

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:19.748
- This way, this way.
- Down there.

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:27.335
Therese!
