00:25.559 --> 00:27.626
(gasping)

00:30.364 --> 00:32.131
I told you to stay away from me.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.199
Jack, don't do it.
I told you
to stay out!

00:34.201 --> 00:35.701
Jack, look at this man.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.572
Look at him.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.208
His name...

00:43.210 --> 00:46.211
is William.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.580
Jack.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.384
You don't have to do this.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.419
Yes, I do!

00:53.421 --> 00:55.220
Yes, I do!

00:58.492 --> 01:00.759
Because he said

01:00.761 --> 01:04.663
we could take the cottage
for two weeks,

01:04.665 --> 01:09.201
'cause they're-they're going
road-tripping out east again.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.571
So, figure we help him
rewire the boathouse.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.074
You know?

01:15.076 --> 01:17.509
That's a pretty
good deal, I figure.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.711
Hmm.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.847
I wanted to show you something.

01:21.849 --> 01:25.150
(sighs)

01:25.152 --> 01:28.153
Just going through some old
stuff in the garage, you know.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.591
I can't remember the name

01:32.593 --> 01:33.859
we gave for this.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.260
Bass-Master.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.497
Bass-Master...

01:38.499 --> 01:41.133
You didn't forget.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.669
A six-pounder
you pulled out of that lake.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.671
Two-pounder.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.806
Two-pounder?
What do you mean?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.408
It was at least
five pounds.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.143
I mean, who's
gonna remember

01:51.145 --> 01:53.212
better-- me or
the six-year old?

01:54.849 --> 01:57.449

02:29.817 --> 02:31.416
Hey, Sally.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.418
New shirt?

02:33.420 --> 02:35.521
You like?

02:35.523 --> 02:36.822
Pink, huh?

02:36.824 --> 02:38.891
The high-risk world
or Internet shopping.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.492
Morning, Sarge.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.760
Hi, Jules.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.329
Hey, we're breaking in
the rookie. Want to watch?

02:44.331 --> 02:46.198
Yeah, yeah. Give me five.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.499
Ten rounds, ten targets.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.201
You don't get to miss.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.836
I don't miss.
Uh-huh.

02:50.838 --> 02:54.406

This week's mockup is
courtesy of Bob the Builder.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.542

men and women of the SRU.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.213

03:01.215 --> 03:02.814
Live ammo, right?

03:02.816 --> 03:05.217
Always.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.386
Hey.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.456
Here we go.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.258
Play nice.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.695

03:16.697 --> 03:18.297

03:19.700 --> 03:21.200
Already started?

03:21.202 --> 03:23.302
Oh, you're just in time.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.437
(trilling)

03:29.843 --> 03:31.310
Pull up a chair.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.779
Sam-tastic.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.515
Mm-hmm.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.451
Not bad.
Faster.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.621
Granny.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.360
WORDY:
Hope no one turns
out the lights.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.294
Nice.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.411
That was good.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.284
Ha!

04:12.286 --> 04:13.252
(beep)

04:18.025 --> 04:20.292
Cool. What else you got?

04:20.294 --> 04:22.261
Are you up for it?

04:22.263 --> 04:23.395
Whoo!

04:23.397 --> 04:25.364
Uh, we're gonna need
the suitcase.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.431
We unpacked it.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.268
Uh, repack it and meet us there.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.269
Hold this, honey.
Okay.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.270
Is the ambulance...?

04:31.272 --> 04:32.471
Uh, no, there's-there's no time.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.307
It would take a half hour
just to get here.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.309
Thanks. Okay, let's go.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.279
Let's go. Let's go.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.914
You okay, Pheebs?

04:42.916 --> 04:44.383
You getting enough air?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.685
Let me check your LP.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.054
It's okay.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.522
(horns honking)
Whoa! Whoa!

04:50.524 --> 04:52.391
(tires squealing)

04:52.393 --> 04:54.293
It'll be okay.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.463
This time tomorrow,
you're gonna be good as new.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.966
(siren wailing)

05:00.968 --> 05:03.468
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:18.452 --> 05:20.319
Officer. Yeah,
I'm sorry.
Sir, get back in your car.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.387
I have an emergency here.
My daughter's very...
Sir!

05:22.389 --> 05:23.555
Get back in
your car, sir.
My daughter is very...

05:23.557 --> 05:24.723
You're not listening to me!

05:24.725 --> 05:25.891
Sir, hands on your car!

05:25.893 --> 05:27.459
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.328
Look, I know I shouldn't
have done it, but we have to...

05:29.330 --> 05:31.029
We have to get to St. Simon's
Hospital right away.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.065
They have a heart.
They have a new heart

05:33.067 --> 05:34.433
for my daughter.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.735
Please, please.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.407
Okay, listen,
follow me close, okay?

05:42.409 --> 05:44.376
Stay on my right bumper.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.378
Okay. Okay.

everything okay?

06:12.639 --> 06:14.139
Oh, yeah.
We got the page.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.407
Oh, that
is awesome.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.075
Thank you.
That is awesome.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.044
Yeah.
Upstairs to
CICU fast!

06:19.046 --> 06:20.645
Thank you. Thank you.

Go!

06:20.647 --> 06:23.548
NURSE:
I'll be right up.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.516
Hey, it's Heather.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.817
Phoebe's on her way in.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.686
Phoebe Swanson,
the heart recipient.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.788
What do you mean?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.759
You've got to be kidding me.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.560
(TV playing indistinctly)

06:35.562 --> 06:38.597
Oh, check it out.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.832
MAN (on TV):
36th on the grid
here at Lowe's Motor...

06:40.834 --> 06:43.502
Mr. Swanson, can I have
a quick word with you?

06:43.504 --> 06:47.439
Yeah. Yeah.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.541
Don't move.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.977
Mr. Swanson,
I'm afraid

06:51.979 --> 06:54.746
we've had a bit of
a miscommunication.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.815
What's up?

06:56.817 --> 06:58.884
Well, the transplant
coordinator...

07:00.087 --> 07:02.487
The recipient list
had been updated.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.489
She had not been
made aware of that.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.493
I know this is
distressing, but
the-the truth is,

07:08.495 --> 07:10.495
another patient
has had to be

07:10.497 --> 07:12.564
given priority.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.005
I'm-I'm sorry. What?

07:20.007 --> 07:21.940
I'm so sorry, Mr. Swanson,

07:21.942 --> 07:24.075
but the next heart
will be Phoebe's.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.746
Uh, may-maybe you
don't know this,

07:27.748 --> 07:29.614
but Phoebe's been
on the waiting list

07:29.616 --> 07:30.949
for 14 months.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.151
I really have to apologize.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.720
She's first in line. She's been
first in line for a month.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.089
This is not a deli counter,
Mr. Swanson, you know that.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.591
Heather, could you please
explain to him?

07:39.593 --> 07:41.526
Look, she was here already
once last week.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.962
She was prepped and everything,
but the heart was flawed.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.664
Do you know what that's like?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.799
Considering the travel time
of this organ...
Yeah?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.468
...the window of survivability
is shorter.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.236
So, then, why are
we standing here?!

07:52.139 --> 07:53.538
In this situation,

07:53.540 --> 07:55.474
the computer selects
the recipient

07:55.476 --> 07:58.143
closer to the hospital.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.811
Closer? The only reason we
were at home is because you,

08:00.814 --> 08:02.981
because the hospital
told us to go home

08:02.983 --> 08:04.583
to prepare ourselves,
to say good-bye.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.585
Did your computer
tell you that?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.387
Mr. Swanson...

08:08.388 --> 08:10.188
And now you're telling me
that if we had just stayed...

08:10.190 --> 08:12.524
I'm telling you that you should
not have been paged today.

08:12.526 --> 08:15.060
I don't care. This is my
daughter. This is<i> my daughter!</i>

08:15.062 --> 08:17.146

Mr. Swanson,
keep your voice down, please.

08:17.147 --> 08:19.231
SWANSON:
No, no, no, I'm very sorry,
I'm very sorry, but screw that.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.966
You are not...
There is no way you are gonna...

08:20.968 --> 08:24.936
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep your voice down.

08:24.938 --> 08:28.540
I'm sorry, Mr. Swanson.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.618
Okay.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.755
Okay.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.991
Okay.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.765
PHOEBE:

08:59.039 --> 09:00.639
Okay, okay,
I'm sorry.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.806
I am sorry.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.208
I'm sorry.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.143

and whimpering)

11:50.777 --> 11:52.277
you'll be my secondary,
tac if required.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.278
You got it.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.913
ED:
Wordy, cover the boss.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.048
Spike, com links, explosives,
if we need 'em.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.283
Copy copy.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.018
A bomb. Make it a bomb.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.286
I never get a bomb.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.787
Explosive entry at least
I would settle for.

12:02.789 --> 12:03.855
ED:
Lou, you're less lethal.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.256
It's a hospital, so no gas.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.257
Less lethal.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.459
(chuckles)

12:07.461 --> 12:08.827
Mr. Braddock,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.930
you may observe
from the command post.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.031
Observe?

12:13.033 --> 12:16.267
Job's not about
being a good shot.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.269
Job's about saving lives.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.505
(sirens wailing)

12:24.411 --> 12:26.277
(tires screeching)

12:40.794 --> 12:41.793
Sergeant Parker?

12:41.795 --> 12:42.827
Yeah.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.329
Floor plans
just came in.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.997
Good. Just one subject?

12:45.999 --> 12:47.031
Male, white.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.032
Where is he?

12:48.034 --> 12:49.300
Uh, here.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.337
Fourth floor, cardiac
intensive care.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.105
Elevator immobilized?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.206
On it.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.808
Keep that outer
perimeter contained.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.209
Our guy carrying
anything else?

12:58.211 --> 12:59.244
Anything else?

12:59.246 --> 13:00.545
Besides your sidearm.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.980
Right. Sorry.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.014
Uh, don't think so.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.282
Hostages?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.151
Surgical team,

13:06.152 --> 13:08.019
heart recipient, uh,
there's critical patients

13:08.021 --> 13:10.155
in ICU rooms,
guy's daughter.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.323
Guy's daughter.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.075
Security room's right here.

13:14.076 --> 13:15.826
Let's make that
the command post.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.163
Wordy, Lou,
get a reccy for the boss.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.898
Morning, gentlemen. SRU.

13:19.900 --> 13:20.965
We need the command post

13:20.967 --> 13:22.167
right here
right now.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.501
MAN:
All right, you
got it. Let's go.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.470
Thank you.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.440
He's moving the patient
into the waiting area.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.909
We need to know
what he's saying.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.011
I'll reverse phone lines.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.284
Establishing inner perimeter
command post at this extension.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.819
Let's cut off distractions.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.487
JULES:
Critical incident.
Multiple hostages taken.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.923
St. Simon's Hospital. 11:01 a.m.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.425
We've been here five minutes,
we don't have a name yet?

13:47.427 --> 13:48.860
Jack Swanson.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.078
This is Heather,
she's a nurse.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.295
JULES:
We need an address
for Jack Swanson--

13:51.298 --> 13:53.464
S-W-A-N-S-O-N--

13:53.466 --> 13:55.433
and detective units
to canvas area friendlies.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.035
His daughter's a patient?

13:57.037 --> 13:58.036
Phoebe.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.237
She was just discharged
to spend

13:59.239 --> 14:01.272
her last days at home,
so she lost her spot

14:01.274 --> 14:02.974
in line for a
heart transplant.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.578
So he's having a bad day, guys.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.513
Where's the heart?

14:08.515 --> 14:09.514
HEATHER:
It's en route.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.482
How long is it viable?

14:11.484 --> 14:13.218
More than an hour
and we run into trouble.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.921
Doesn't leave us
a lot of time, guys.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.057
Sarge, you want to get
an early start, we feed you

14:19.059 --> 14:20.058
on the fly?
Yeah.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.593
Yeah, I'm game.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.127
Heather, do you mind
sticking around?

14:23.129 --> 14:24.529
Lou, Wordy, I'm coming out.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.463
Let's see if we can
get Mr. Swanson home.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.636
JULES (through earpiece):
Jack's a single father,

14:31.638 --> 14:34.505
self-employed handyman.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.341
Do you think he's the type
of guy to fire a gun?

14:36.343 --> 14:38.610
I don't know.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.445
He's a regular guy.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.080
I-I think he just
sort of snapped.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.318
Jack Swanson!

14:47.320 --> 14:49.120
This is the police,
Strategic Response Unit.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.355
How you doing?

14:52.125 --> 14:54.158
(typing)

14:54.160 --> 14:56.961
Okay, three nurses here,
one surgeon.

14:56.963 --> 15:00.031
Immobilized patients
here, here, here and here.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.100
It's fish in a barrel.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.167
Where's the subject?

15:03.169 --> 15:04.569
He's here,

15:04.571 --> 15:07.038
in the CICU.

15:07.040 --> 15:07.972
East hallway
is sterile.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.407
Sterile?

15:09.409 --> 15:12.076
Means subject has no
shot unless he moves.

15:12.078 --> 15:12.977
What if he moves?

15:12.979 --> 15:14.212
(typing)

15:14.214 --> 15:16.614
Everything changes.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.385
(whispering):
No, no, no, no, no.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.986
No.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.264
(beeping)

15:33.266 --> 15:36.000
All right, these guys
are with me.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.435
They don't move unless I say so.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.170
11:07 a.m.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.706
Sergeant Greg Parker
begins negotiation.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.042
It's my job to help you.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.177
And I want to make sure
no one gets hurt.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.512
Want you to back off.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.047
Can't do that, Jack.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.215
We're gonna stay right here.

15:51.217 --> 15:53.084
Is it all right
if I call you Jack?

15:53.086 --> 15:54.085
My name's Greg.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.486
Hey, I mean it!

15:55.488 --> 15:58.122
Let's just talk, okay?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.424
How's his home life?

15:59.426 --> 16:00.692
There's just
the two of them.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.260
Pretty close.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.628
His wife died.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.662
Do you know how?

16:04.664 --> 16:08.299
She was killed
in a car accident.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.968
Jack was driving.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.503
JULES (through earpiece):
He's suffering from

16:12.505 --> 16:14.405
survivor's guilt
over his wife's death.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.208
Sounds like you're pretty upset
about something.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.242
Maybe I can help.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.444
What do you think?

16:19.446 --> 16:22.146
Why don't you turn
the TVs back on.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.649
My daughter was
watching TV, all right?

16:29.155 --> 16:31.055
He wants his daughter's eyes
on the TV, not him.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.290
Let's get something
from him first.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.093
Okay, I'll start
working on that.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.728
In the meantime,
why don't you tell me

16:36.730 --> 16:38.763
why we're all here today.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.365
What's this all about, Jack?

16:40.367 --> 16:42.467
About saving my daughter's life!

16:42.469 --> 16:45.770
All right.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.305
What's your daughter's name?

16:47.307 --> 16:50.308
We've got two civilians
in the OR here

16:50.310 --> 16:52.310
and a group
near the subject here.
(phone ringing)

16:52.312 --> 16:54.145
We already know
why the perp's here.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.646
JULES:
Command post.
He's a subject, not a perp.

16:55.648 --> 16:56.781
He's a guy with a gun.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.349
He's a father in trouble.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.152
Ask questions, Sam.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.787
ED:
You show him that
you're listening.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.490
All right, thanks.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.091
Heart's here.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.893
(whispering):
Yeah, that's fine.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.694
Let's just make sure we keep it
out of the way, okay?

17:10.697 --> 17:13.131
Your daughter's been waiting for
a heart, is that right, Jack?

17:13.133 --> 17:14.132
SWANSON:
Yeah.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.701
She's been waiting over a year.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.236
She can't wait anymore.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.171
I understand.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.806
So let's work together

17:21.808 --> 17:25.243
and see if we can figure
something out, okay?

17:25.245 --> 17:27.545
But, Jack, right now,
I'm sorry,

17:27.547 --> 17:29.480
but I need to ask you
a little favor.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.516
Can you just let me know how
everyone's doing over there?

17:31.518 --> 17:32.951
Because when I talk

17:32.952 --> 17:34.385
to my bosses, they're
gonna want to make sure

17:34.387 --> 17:37.255
everyone's safe, and, uh,
I can't really see too well

17:37.257 --> 17:40.158
from over here, so...

17:40.160 --> 17:41.826
I need to know
that they're okay.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.228
Can you ask them for me?

17:53.206 --> 17:55.540
You okay?

17:55.542 --> 17:56.774
Dad...

17:56.776 --> 17:58.476
I got to do this, sweetheart.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.677
I got to.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.079
You're okay?

18:02.615 --> 18:03.681
Okay.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.218
You guys okay?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.721
Yeah, they're okay.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.523
How about the other patient?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.661
Is the other patient okay?

18:20.333 --> 18:21.866
Hey, uh,

18:21.867 --> 18:23.400
are you-you,
are you okay?

18:29.342 --> 18:30.808
(whispers):
Yeah.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.510
He's okay.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.678
Thank you, Jack.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.179
You did real good.

18:35.181 --> 18:38.816
Harder to hurt someone
you connect to.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.619
'Cause then they're
real people, too.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.454
PARKER:
Everyone's fine.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.655
Jack did a real good job here.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.191
How we doing on those
TVs for Phoebe?

18:47.193 --> 18:48.192
What's your take, Jules?

18:48.194 --> 18:50.361
Think he's doing good.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.131
11:14.
Parker initiates Stockholm.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.366
TV demand granted.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.569
Got to be a less
lethal option.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.404
Let me shoot the gun;
problem solved.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.572
Too risky.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.141
I won't miss.

19:03.143 --> 19:06.144
Gun fragments, civilians--
we don't get away

19:06.146 --> 19:07.311
with collateral
damage here, Sam.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.513
We need to isolate.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.553
(siren whoops)

19:15.554 --> 19:18.221
JULES:
<i> 11:15. Forensic psychologist</i>
<i> arrives on scene.</i>

19:18.224 --> 19:20.324
Good morning.
Luria here.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.777
Morning, Doc.

19:22.778 --> 19:25.229
Subject is Jack Swanson, in
transition from red to yellow.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.831
He's responsive to Stockholm.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.433
No flies on you guys.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.502
No, he's working
the Greg Parker magic.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.171
Let me access meds and mentals.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.239
I'll get right back to you.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.444
They said I should talk to you.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.313
I'm Jack Swanson's home nurse.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.348
Why don't you just
tase his ass?

19:44.350 --> 19:45.850
Muscle spasm-- he'll
pull the trigger.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.418
So we go in hard tactical.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.855
ED:
Yeah, I was just
getting to that.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.257
Look, something
I need you to do.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.692
All right, see
these stairs here?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.227
That's where we
came in, right?

19:56.229 --> 19:57.595
Need you to make
a reverse entry.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.463
Go across this hallway,
these doors here,

19:59.465 --> 20:00.731
I need you to go
through them.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.600
Now, be careful, because
that is a big road.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.834
I want you
to cross it.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.603
I want you to make an
entry into this Timmy's.

20:05.605 --> 20:06.704
I'll have a
double double.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.872
Jules.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.940
Cream, no sugar.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.309
ED:
Spike.
No, I'm good.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.411
You serious?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.479
(typing)

20:21.554 --> 20:23.821
Went all coffee shop on his ass.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.257
(laughs)

20:26.259 --> 20:27.491
LURIA:
<i> Do you think we can talk</i>

20:27.493 --> 20:28.926
a little about the
last few weeks--

20:28.928 --> 20:29.994
what that's been
like for him?

20:29.996 --> 20:31.963
Sure.
Great.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.264
Is that Phoebe's?

20:33.266 --> 20:35.533
Yes.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.702
SWANSON:
And now-now they want

20:37.704 --> 20:39.470
to give her heart
to-to somebody else.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.871
And they expect me
to what, just walk away?

20:40.873 --> 20:43.274
JULES:
Heart's still en route, boss.

20:43.276 --> 20:46.244
She's your daughter.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.311
That's right.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.380
See, you get it, right?

20:49.382 --> 20:51.382
You just want to help her.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.917
You got kids, right?

20:52.919 --> 20:55.386
I can tell
you love her a lot, Jack.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.288
You got kids.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.724
(chuckles lightly)

20:59.726 --> 21:01.892
Yeah, I do.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.494
A boy.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.997
What's he doing?

21:05.999 --> 21:07.632
What?

21:07.634 --> 21:09.967
Negotiating 101--
never lie to the subject.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.336
He's not lying.

21:12.338 --> 21:13.738
He has a kid.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.373
Really?

21:15.375 --> 21:16.774
Before your time.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.975
LURIA:
Jules,

21:17.977 --> 21:20.478
she reckons Jack hasn't
slept in three days.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.847
So we're looking
at impaired cognitive function

21:22.849 --> 21:24.315
and irritability.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.617
Emotional volatility,
impulsiveness.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.353
Hey, any word?

21:29.355 --> 21:31.322
Any word?
Yeah, the heart.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.990
It needs to get up there
or it dies.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.892
Then, you'd better get it
up there-- fourth floor.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.898
Whoa, hey, this area
is still restricted.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.000
That SRU guy
just cleared me.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.570
He's 16.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.005
He's going to be 16
next week.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.808
So you know what it's like.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.477
Come on, you come home
every day to your kids.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.646
They keep you going.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.581
It's true; kids keep you going.

21:57.583 --> 22:00.785
So can you imagine losing that?

22:00.787 --> 22:02.420
Yeah, yeah, I can imagine.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.456
I mean, you'd do anything
for your kid, right?

22:05.458 --> 22:06.590
Uh, what's his name?

22:08.461 --> 22:10.428
(typing)

22:10.430 --> 22:12.463
Dean.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.532
Dean.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.834
what would you do?

22:16.836 --> 22:18.703
Come on, help me out
a little bit here.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.338
What would you do?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.940
What's going on?

22:22.942 --> 22:23.941
We got a breach.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.743
Where'd he go?

22:27.113 --> 22:28.813
Trouble.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.047
That's the heart, right?

22:30.049 --> 22:31.582
That's her heart.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.584
Jack, just stay with me.
That's her heart.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.753
Jack!
Excuse me,
excuse me, I'll take that.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.388
Give it to me,
give it to me!

22:37.390 --> 22:38.456
Okay, okay.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.527
He's got the heart.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.079
How the hell...?

22:45.080 --> 22:46.630
Get those elevators
locked off.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.070
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.673
Out the door you came in, go.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.008
Okay, back off.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.443
PARKER:
Okay, Jack.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.547
Put the gun down, okay?

23:05.852 --> 23:07.485
What do we do now?

23:07.487 --> 23:11.589
Well, I mean, we got the page...

23:11.591 --> 23:12.590
I got the heart,

23:12.592 --> 23:15.493
so I think you
know what we do.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.978
Uh, they've already done
her blood and urine tests,

23:16.979 --> 23:18.462
so they should start
her immunosuppressants.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.664
Now, let's get
this thing done.

23:20.666 --> 23:21.966
Doc, you stay
where you are.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.667
Spike, take over
as secondary.

23:23.669 --> 23:26.404
Jules...
Gotcha.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.606
Needs to be prepped for surgery.
No, he's going nowhere.

23:28.608 --> 23:29.974
Jack, let's just think...
This heart can't go
to waste.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.175
Then it's going to my daughter.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.779
Just calm down, Jack,
think this through.
Stop, stop.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.814
All right,
hold it right there!
No one's hurt yet.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.316
Calm down.
Stop!

23:38.317 --> 23:39.817
We all go home safe.
JULES:
Got the solution.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.485
Jack, Jack,
just listen to me.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

23:41.487 --> 23:43.087
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.755
Safety's on,
safety's on.
Everybody,
stop, stop!

23:44.757 --> 23:45.990
Less lethal go.

23:50.696 --> 23:52.763
(panting):
Stop... stop.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.932
(gunshot)

23:57.437 --> 23:59.203
Shot fired, shot fired,
officer down.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.872
Wordy!

24:06.679 --> 24:07.812
(stammering)

24:07.814 --> 24:09.713
I didn't mean that!

24:09.715 --> 24:10.748
Wordy.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.882
I'm okay.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.685
Vest.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.720
PARKER:
We're holding fire,
we're holding fire.

24:16.722 --> 24:17.822
I'm... so sorry.

24:17.824 --> 24:18.823
Holding fire, Jack.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.224
Holding fire.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.826
Wordy, I'm pulling you back.

24:21.828 --> 24:24.094
(panting and groaning)

24:24.096 --> 24:25.996
Copy.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.998
11:28.
Heart breached the perimeter.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.967
Subject re-escalated to red.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.903
Jack, listen
to me, okay?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.171
That was not
what you meant to do.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.173
ED:
Jules, stay ready.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.977
No, I-I-I didn't mean it.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.612
He's okay, Jack.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.681
You okay, Mr. Wordsworth?

24:43.683 --> 24:45.182
I'm all right.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.617
He's okay, Jack.
You see?

24:46.619 --> 24:49.086
Your bullet hit his vest
and that's a good thing.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.955
And it's a good thing
that I was here

24:50.957 --> 24:53.157
and I saw that you didn't mean
to use that gun on my friend.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.626
Right?
No, yeah, no,
I-I didn't, I didn't mean it.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.628
Okay,
of course you didn't.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.897
And I trust you on that,

24:59.899 --> 25:02.766
so now you got
to trust me, okay?

25:02.768 --> 25:04.502
We're running out of time
on that heart, Jack.

25:04.504 --> 25:05.836
What do you say
we give it to the doc?

25:05.838 --> 25:07.938
I can't do that.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.640
Jack.

25:09.642 --> 25:11.108
Spike.

25:11.110 --> 25:14.144
(typing)
We need to get him out
of the waiting area.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.847
We need an empty room.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.883
Hey, you got to start prepping
my daughter for surgery now.

25:18.885 --> 25:21.369
Okay?

25:21.370 --> 25:23.854
Doc, don't you need
to make tests on the heart

25:23.856 --> 25:25.189
to make sure it's usable?

25:25.191 --> 25:27.291
Yes, we need to examine
the heart for tissue damage

25:27.293 --> 25:28.592
during transport.

25:28.594 --> 25:29.827
Okay, well,
we want to...

25:29.829 --> 25:32.997
see that heart taken care of,
right, Jack?

25:35.935 --> 25:37.935
Yeah, okay,
but I stay with it.

25:37.937 --> 25:38.936
Well...

25:38.938 --> 25:40.671
can you do that, Doc?

25:40.673 --> 25:41.839
Don't you need a...

25:41.841 --> 25:43.173
a sterile environment?

25:43.175 --> 25:44.542
We do.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.127
Then that's
a problem, Jack.

25:46.128 --> 25:47.711
You see, that gun,
that gun isn't sterile.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.647
Remember what we said

25:49.648 --> 25:51.582
about doing everything
we can for our kids?

25:51.584 --> 25:52.816
This is one
of those things.

25:52.818 --> 25:55.819
Okay.

25:55.821 --> 25:58.022
Okay, all right.

26:02.828 --> 26:03.827
No,

26:03.829 --> 26:05.563
he stays right here.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.631
Okay, Jack.

26:09.268 --> 26:12.102
Okay.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.940
HEATHER:
<i> It's not fair.</i>

26:15.942 --> 26:18.042
It was his decision.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.643
What was?

26:19.645 --> 26:22.146
She was dying
and they made him choose

26:22.148 --> 26:24.949
and he chose
to take Phoebe back home.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.685
He must feel
like it's his fault.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.653
Come on,
what's going on, guys?

26:29.655 --> 26:31.255
We can't isolate Jack.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.224
Well, let's keep working
on that, then.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.894
Are these two ORs side by side?

26:37.930 --> 26:39.163
Yes.
Spike, you bring charges?

26:39.165 --> 26:40.598
SPIKE:
Yeah.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.800
We're going to need
rappelling gear, too.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.936
Wordy, you take over
here for Spike.

26:45.938 --> 26:49.840
Boss... this is
what I'm thinking.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.977
We maybe got an option "B."

26:52.979 --> 26:55.079
We got to get Phoebe to OR One.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.848
Spin it to Jack, no promises.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.283
Lewis, you good to go
on my call?

26:59.285 --> 27:00.651
LEWIS:
Copy.

27:00.653 --> 27:01.952
All right,
we're running out of time.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.637
Let's keep up with the intel,

27:03.638 --> 27:05.321
give the boss
something he can work with.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.024
Jack?

27:07.026 --> 27:08.192
Yeah.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.227
They're still doing
some tests on the heart.

27:10.229 --> 27:13.230
Now, nothing's new,
no promises,

27:13.232 --> 27:15.366
but we want to move Phoebe
into the OR

27:15.368 --> 27:18.268
and get her ready just
in case, is that okay?

27:24.143 --> 27:28.345
Yeah.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.982
Yeah, that would...
that would be great.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.418
Okay.

27:36.389 --> 27:38.656
Thank you.

27:39.392 --> 27:42.426
(clattering lightly)

27:46.365 --> 27:47.798
Jules, subject is moving.

27:47.800 --> 27:48.799
Take your white hallway.

27:48.801 --> 27:49.867
Go, go, go.

27:51.737 --> 27:55.272
Meds and mentals:
pretty clean mental history.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.107
Prescription
for SSRI antidepressants

27:57.109 --> 27:58.809
after his wife's death.

27:58.811 --> 28:02.279
Home nurse says
his family is overseas.

28:07.720 --> 28:11.922
You got less than a half hour
on the heart.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.023
We got nowhere to go.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.393
There's civilians
everywhere-- OR, ICU.

28:16.394 --> 28:19.762
Our only solution is lethal.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.932
We saving Jack
or we saving the heart?

28:25.871 --> 28:28.739
Wh-Wh-Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

28:28.741 --> 28:29.740
What are you doing?

28:29.742 --> 28:31.208
Come on, move
him back.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.276
Move him back.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.944
Okay, Jack.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.813
Move him back.

28:35.815 --> 28:36.980
You step away.

28:36.982 --> 28:39.817
Leave him there.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.355
ED:
Sierra One?

28:45.357 --> 28:46.924
In position.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.761
Lou, Jules is on him.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.896
Lewis,
you take a break.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.269
(scoffs)

29:01.774 --> 29:03.407
LURIA:
Keep him on the happy stuff.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.844
Sam.

29:06.846 --> 29:10.047
Sending up the heart--
that was you?

29:10.049 --> 29:11.482
Yeah, it was
running out of time.

29:11.484 --> 29:14.418
I assumed...
Never, never assume, Sam.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.754
If it looks simple,
it's usually not.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.340
You tossed in a lit match

29:19.341 --> 29:21.925
and you left your team
to put out the fire.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.193
Is everyone all right?

29:27.833 --> 29:31.969
In the spirit of fostering
a little mutual trust?

29:31.971 --> 29:34.338
It belongs to the girl?

29:34.340 --> 29:35.906
I should bring it up.

29:35.908 --> 29:36.907
Maybe it would help.

29:36.909 --> 29:40.978
Good idea.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.880
TV ANNOUNCER:
It's rocket time.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.849
Gianni won the poles
for both races here last year.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.786
There's ten laps to go.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.954
(quietly):
Yeah.

29:50.956 --> 29:51.955
Gianni's leading,

29:51.957 --> 29:52.923
but it doesn't mean anything.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.124
Garrity's five back,

29:54.126 --> 29:56.460
but he'll save his juice
for the last two.

29:57.396 --> 30:00.898
Just like Capretti.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.967
Daytona '98.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.103
Did you see it?

30:06.105 --> 30:08.372
I was there.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.007
Oh, yeah?

30:10.009 --> 30:11.742
Yeah.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.476
Yeah, a friend of mine went
to summer camp with Capretti

30:13.479 --> 30:17.314
and, uh, he got us in,
VIP treatment.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.316
So you went with your... son?

30:19.318 --> 30:20.551
Yeah.

30:20.553 --> 30:22.986
Yeah, we got to go down
into the pit.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.289
Capretti gave Dean
one of his race gloves.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.124
Shut up.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.927
You watch with Phoebe?

30:30.896 --> 30:32.963
Oh, yeah.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.135
So is your boy Dean a fan?

30:38.137 --> 30:42.272
(chuckles lightly)

30:42.274 --> 30:43.974
I don't know.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.076
What do you mean you don't know?

30:46.078 --> 30:50.080
I mean I-I don't know.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.516
Uh, I haven't seen my son
in a long time.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.953
I'm sorry.
What?

30:55.955 --> 30:58.055
I haven't seen him
in nine years.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.858
Now, wait a second.

31:00.860 --> 31:03.994
You just said that your...
your kid's your life.

31:03.996 --> 31:05.028
It's true, he is.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.263
Well, you-you
said you

31:06.265 --> 31:07.665
knew what it was like.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.066
That you come home everyday
to your kid.
Not exactly.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.068
What I said was...

31:11.070 --> 31:12.936
I said was...

31:12.938 --> 31:15.072
He said "You come home everyday
to your kids,

31:15.074 --> 31:16.240
it keeps you going."

31:16.242 --> 31:17.908
You said "It's true.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.460
Your kids keep you going."

31:19.461 --> 31:21.011
I said "It's true,
they keep you going."

31:21.013 --> 31:23.046
I didn't say I see him
every day.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.148
I said they keep you going
and that's true.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.150
My wife left with Dean
nine years ago.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.653
And I tried to turn
a lot of things around

31:29.655 --> 31:32.956
so I could be a better guy,
a better dad,

31:32.958 --> 31:34.925
but, uh...

31:34.927 --> 31:36.927
I don't... I don't know if he

31:36.929 --> 31:39.263
still likes
stock car.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.265
(sighs)

31:41.267 --> 31:43.667
I don't know
what his shoe size is, Jack.

31:43.669 --> 31:47.037
I lost my chance.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.106
I lost my chance.

31:51.010 --> 31:54.211
But this thing you're trying
to do for your daughter here...

31:54.213 --> 31:57.247
I understand that.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.349
I really
understand that.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.184
And I can't say
that I wouldn't do

32:01.186 --> 32:03.287
the same thing.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.188
But at the end of the day,

32:05.190 --> 32:08.191
you gotta be there for her.

32:08.193 --> 32:09.693
No, no, you know what?

32:09.695 --> 32:11.194
It d-doesn't matter.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.196
Thing is it doesn't matter
that I'm there for her.

32:13.198 --> 32:15.032
What matters...

32:15.034 --> 32:17.601
is that she has her life,
that's it.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.970
That's important.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.005
So, um, where's

32:22.007 --> 32:24.207
the heart anyway? Why haven't
they taken it in to Phoebe?

32:24.209 --> 32:26.677
Uh...
(clears throat)

32:28.414 --> 32:29.479
Boss, the heart.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.580
We're almost out of time.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.483
There's only 15 minutes left.

32:33.485 --> 32:36.987
All right, I'm breaking a lot
of rules here, Jack.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.989
Okay?

32:38.991 --> 32:40.590
But the truth is...

32:42.094 --> 32:45.462
...they're not going to let
Phoebe have that heart.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.634
No, no, you said that
they were working on it.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.636
That's what...

32:52.638 --> 32:55.706
that's something negotiators do.

32:55.708 --> 32:57.374
We stall for time.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.377
We-we pass the buck, we...
we stretch the truth.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.713
But I don't want to lie to you,
Jack.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.583
What's he doing?

33:06.585 --> 33:08.585
He knows we're at the end
of the line.

33:08.587 --> 33:10.053
Yeah, but
you can't just...

33:10.055 --> 33:12.089
He knows what he's doing.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.391
I could keep asking them.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.727
I can keep asking them,
and asking them.

33:16.729 --> 33:18.762
The thing is that...

33:18.764 --> 33:21.431
they are never going
to let you have that heart.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.532
Yes...

33:22.534 --> 33:24.034
No, no, yes they will.
They will!

33:24.036 --> 33:26.269
Jack, one guy walks into a place
with a gun

33:26.271 --> 33:28.038
and gets what he wants...

33:28.040 --> 33:30.140
next thing you know a whole
bunch of guys are thinking,

33:30.142 --> 33:32.242
"Hey, maybe
I can get the same thing."

33:34.213 --> 33:36.279
Becomes a big problem,
Jack.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.284
I know you're tired,
buddy.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.120
I know you're tired.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.588
There's a chance your daughter

33:44.590 --> 33:46.256
will get another
heart.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.258
You still have
a chance...

33:48.260 --> 33:50.260
if you let him go.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.195
If you let them
do their work.
I'm sorry, man.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.498
I can't.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
(sobbing):
Okay. All right.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.568
Okay.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.708
It's going to be okay. Go.

34:07.312 --> 34:09.312
Thank you, Jack.

34:09.314 --> 34:11.314
Go.

34:11.316 --> 34:14.184
That was a good choice, Jack.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.186
It was a good choice.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.255
(sobbing)

34:20.225 --> 34:23.226
What's your dig, Jules?

34:23.228 --> 34:25.195
Gone from red to yellow.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.264
Now, let's get him
off this...

34:28.500 --> 34:30.167
Get the heart...

34:30.169 --> 34:32.369
Now just put the gun down
on the floor.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.338
(sniffling)

34:35.340 --> 34:37.574
You stay away from me.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.576
Okay.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.244
You said that this
heart wasn't

34:41.246 --> 34:43.713
going to go to waste,
is that right?
Jack...

34:43.715 --> 34:45.849
No solution. No solution.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.851
This is not good.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.219
This is Option B.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.288
Sierra One,
prepare to trade off.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.223
Go! Go! Go!

35:16.381 --> 35:17.581
I told you to stay away from me.

35:17.583 --> 35:18.615
Jack, don't do it.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.150
I told you to stay out!

35:20.152 --> 35:21.485
Jack, look at this man.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.356
Look at him.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.226
His name...

35:29.228 --> 35:32.162
is William.

35:32.164 --> 35:34.331
Jack...

35:36.235 --> 35:38.335
You don't have to do this.

35:38.337 --> 35:41.204
Yes, I do! Yes, I do!

35:41.206 --> 35:43.907
WORDY:
Boss, there's minutes left
on the heart.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.276
You have to do something.

35:46.278 --> 35:49.279
Jack, I'm sorry.

35:49.281 --> 35:50.147
What?

35:50.149 --> 35:52.215
I'm sorry, Jack.

35:52.217 --> 35:54.317
But the tests came back,
and the heart's damaged.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.819
Well, I don't believe you!

35:55.821 --> 35:57.354
Jack, you could
use that gun,

35:57.356 --> 35:59.322
but I'm telling you
it'll be for nothing.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.491
So you can decide

36:01.493 --> 36:04.161
to do something
for nothing.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.729
Or you can go into that
other room over there

36:05.731 --> 36:07.430
and you can be
with your daughter.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.636
Maybe she gets
another chance.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.638
Maybe another heart
comes through.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.641
You gotta believe
it will.

36:17.643 --> 36:20.644
But right not what do you
think Phoebe wants?

36:20.646 --> 36:22.712
Right now.

36:25.751 --> 36:28.418
You want to see your daughter?

36:35.827 --> 36:38.862
Go see Phoebe, Jack.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.398
We'll back off.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.466
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

37:01.286 --> 37:03.520
Is this something you needed?

37:37.456 --> 37:39.856
Spike and Jules, stand by.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.524
<i> Subject moving.</i>

37:41.526 --> 37:43.260
<i> He's still armed.</i>

38:01.847 --> 38:03.446
Police!

38:03.448 --> 38:04.781
Get down!
JULES:
Get the gun!

38:04.783 --> 38:06.483
Get the gun!
Get down!

38:06.485 --> 38:09.452
Don't move! Don't move!
Stay down! Stay down!

38:09.454 --> 38:10.587
Do not move!

38:10.589 --> 38:11.955
Stay down!

38:25.504 --> 38:27.337
I'm sorry.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.439
You said the heart was no good.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.675
Yeah, I wanted to keep you safe.

38:31.677 --> 38:35.412
Said you knew what it was like,
but you don't know.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.480
You don't know what it's like!

38:40.319 --> 38:42.319
You all right, Sarge?

38:42.321 --> 38:44.454
Yeah.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.523
Let's go.
Up.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.536
(exhales heavily)

39:03.408 --> 39:04.841
WORDY:
<i> 11:53 a.m.</i>

39:04.843 --> 39:06.576
Subject contained.

39:06.578 --> 39:07.777
Incident resolved.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.683
You reescalated him.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.655
Wordy,
get those transcripts printed?

39:18.657 --> 39:20.724
You let it
get personal.

39:54.459 --> 39:57.527

40:19.151 --> 40:20.550

40:20.552 --> 40:22.619
Change of plans.

40:34.699 --> 40:37.534
You gave a life today.

40:38.503 --> 40:41.504
Wasn't my turn.
