WEBVTT

01:06.524 --> 01:09.110
I know what you're thinking, Miguel.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.453
Something's going wrong.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.706
This is all very strange.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.501
Yeah...

01:25.710 --> 01:27.003
it is.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.008
Everything's changed.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.977
Is it you?

01:54.906 --> 01:57.200
You remember this place, don't you?

01:59.911 --> 02:01.746
The children loved it here.

02:04.999 --> 02:07.293
They would beg us to come.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.840
And when you found those old bikes...

02:14.467 --> 02:17.846
riding them up and down these hills...

02:20.265 --> 02:21.975
the kids chasing...

02:23.893 --> 02:25.395
dying of laughter...

02:27.230 --> 02:29.440
screaming for you to stop.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.039
They're chasing you, Miguel.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.501
Run.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.382
<i>Run.</i>

02:57.010 --> 02:57.927
<i>Run.</i>

03:00.722 --> 03:03.433
Run!

03:09.105 --> 03:10.690
You have no idea...

03:11.691 --> 03:13.193
what's coming for you.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.863
What you've started.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.288
I don't want to be here.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.958
You haven't gotten far enough away.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.298
I fucked up.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.513
He told you so, didn't he?

03:44.349 --> 03:45.600
Oh, Miguel.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.605
You're too smart not to see it.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.777
There's no going back.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.502
Too slow.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.798
What's wrong with you, asshole?

06:22.673 --> 06:25.718
Grab your shit, Dopey. Let's move.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.729
The fuck you want?

06:37.271 --> 06:38.731
Get in.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.650
Need to get to the hospital and quick.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.111
We're gonna kill some people.

06:45.446 --> 06:48.032
Inside. Room 23.

06:48.950 --> 06:53.246
He's at the end of the hallway,
to the left.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.874
There's two guys guarding him.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.801
My family and I are sorry
for what happened.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.637
My brother had no business
getting tied up in all this.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.765
Life's been hard.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.726
It hasn't been easy.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.446
She just drop a dime
on her fucking brother?

07:28.781 --> 07:31.701
-I'm talking to you.
-That's why we're here.

07:31.784 --> 07:35.329
-To get some fucking answers!
-Fucking answers to what?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.584
Just cover my back.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.562
-Come here.

08:03.065 --> 08:03.900
Quiet!

08:17.830 --> 08:19.957
-Drop it, asshole!
- Lower the gun!

08:20.041 --> 08:21.626
On the ground!

08:21.709 --> 08:25.588
We only want him.
Don't be a hero for a dead man.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.387
Unhook him from all that shit.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.098
Please,
if you unhook him, he'll die.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.226
He's gonna die anyway.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.230
Come on, man.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.429
<i>You were looking for a conspiracy?</i>

09:15.513 --> 09:19.183
<i>Well, we found it. Rubén Zuno Arce.</i>

09:19.267 --> 09:21.602
<i>Your living, breathing grassy knoll.</i>

09:22.436 --> 09:24.146
<i>A bloodline to the throne.</i>

09:24.814 --> 09:28.067
<i>Married to former president</i>
<i>Luis Echeverría's daughter.</i>

09:28.150 --> 09:29.318
<i>Zuno's uncle?</i>

09:29.902 --> 09:31.654
<i>The Minister of Defense.</i>

09:31.737 --> 09:33.364
<i>Couldn't make this shit up.</i>

09:34.282 --> 09:37.827
<i>Besides acting as a go-between</i>
<i>for Mexico City and the narcos,</i>

09:37.910 --> 09:40.079
<i>Zuno fancies himself as a businessman.</i>

09:40.162 --> 09:41.706
Very well.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.709
<i>Sits on the board of several companies.</i>

09:44.792 --> 09:45.793
Sir...

09:46.752 --> 09:47.587
Hi.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.380
<i>Even owns a few himself.</i>

09:53.884 --> 09:57.013
<i>Better put, he inherited a few.</i>

09:57.930 --> 10:00.933
<i>♪ Look at me</i>
<i>Always... ♪</i>

10:01.017 --> 10:02.935
<i>Family has a thing for art.</i>

10:03.019 --> 10:04.895
<i>Generous with their donations.</i>

10:06.063 --> 10:09.609
<i>The Tate in London, the Galleria in Rome,</i>

10:10.318 --> 10:13.988
<i>and two Picassos at the Palacio,</i>
<i>here in Mexico City.</i>

10:14.488 --> 10:16.365
ACQUIRED VIA THE ZUNO ARCE FOUNDATION

10:16.449 --> 10:18.993
<i>But don't let Zuno</i>
<i>and his philanthropic endeavors fool you.</i>

10:19.076 --> 10:20.411
<i>Has a taste for more than just art.</i>

10:22.038 --> 10:24.707
<i>Never met a line of coke he didn't love</i>

10:24.790 --> 10:26.792
<i>or a call girl he didn't want to fuck.</i>

10:27.918 --> 10:30.671
<i>Oh, yeah, and he loves golf.</i>

10:32.089 --> 10:33.299
<i>What's wrong with golf?</i>

10:35.635 --> 10:36.802
Uh...

10:36.886 --> 10:39.805
Nothing. I'm just mentioning
that he likes it.

10:40.681 --> 10:41.891
Arrive at your point.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.686
Zuno owns property. A lot of it.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.316
881 Lope de Vega. Ring a bell?

10:51.734 --> 10:52.902
The house Kiki was killed at.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.946
Yeah, the asshole isn't just connected.
He was fucking there.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.617
All right? Zuno doesn't just link
Félix Gallardo to the Mexican government.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.911
It puts them both at the scene
of Kiki's murder.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.245
So...

11:04.080 --> 11:05.164
how do we get him?

11:05.748 --> 11:08.334
That's, um... sort of a problem.

11:08.918 --> 11:13.798
You know, he heard rumors that we're here,
he spooked and figures he's next.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.508
Zuno's underground?

11:16.008 --> 11:18.511
He's holed up in a compound
in Puerto Vallarta.

11:19.595 --> 11:24.266
Oh, he asked his uncle for support,
and he sent the fucking army.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.646
Oh, fucking Christ.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.944
Guess that's the cost of making noise,
huh, Walt?

11:37.071 --> 11:39.031
Thought you could shoot it out
in the street?

11:39.115 --> 11:40.366
Not draw eyes?

11:41.283 --> 11:43.369
Things didn't go as planned.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.955
We adapted and did what was necessary.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.833
Verdín's in the fucking morgue.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.960
Was that necessary?

11:55.506 --> 11:57.383
I sleep just fine, sir.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.804
I did what I was brought down here to do,
and I'm not gonna apologize for it.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.681
Then don't.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.766
Make it worth something.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.230
We got the green light.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.443
-This is it, fellas.
-Whoo-hoo!

12:15.526 --> 12:16.694
The golden ticket.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.696
The whole reason we're down here.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.283
We know where he is,
so today we go get him.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.077
What about the army?

12:26.287 --> 12:27.163
Not leaving.

12:28.205 --> 12:30.875
We go in guns a-blazing,
we'll get eaten alive, so...

12:31.667 --> 12:33.169
we gotta do this one different.

12:34.044 --> 12:37.256
I don't know. See how this man
handled an assault rifle?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.634
Yeah, seen where that leads?

12:42.887 --> 12:43.971
Kenny's right.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.347
All right? I fucked up.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.476
Shit got loud and a whole lot harder.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.145
We're on their radar, but...

12:51.979 --> 12:54.565
we're in this fight, so let's finish it.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.736
Okay, so...

13:00.070 --> 13:01.322
what's the play?

13:02.406 --> 13:04.450
Well, what do we know?

13:05.367 --> 13:07.620
Target and location.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.997
And we know he's scared.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.250
So, that's our hand.
We play all three of them against him.

13:14.418 --> 13:15.586
Sounds really good, Walt,

13:15.669 --> 13:17.713
but did anybody else see the end
of <i>Butch Cassidy?</i>

13:19.048 --> 13:22.051
The guy's got military positioned
all over the fucking compound.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.386
Well, we get creative.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.472
It's not exactly our style.

13:27.515 --> 13:31.560
Come on, guys. Every smash-and-grab crew's
gotta grow up sometime.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.320
<i>Comandante Sergio Verdín...</i>

14:23.404 --> 14:25.239
<i>Félix, he's dead.</i>

14:25.823 --> 14:28.617
<i>He was at Lope de Vega. That makes two.</i>

14:31.328 --> 14:35.916
I have to see Calderoni.
Tell him to come here today.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.426
<i>Something out there got you guys scared?</i>

14:46.218 --> 14:47.595
What've you heard?

14:48.345 --> 14:49.305
Rumors.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.683
It's an American operation.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.228
Though, officially,
the embassy's denied knowledge.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.773
-So, what are they looking for?
- Well, you.

15:00.774 --> 15:01.984
Can't imagine why.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.612
And what are you doing
to stop this bullshit?

15:06.614 --> 15:09.450
The Americans' identities are unknown.
They are small-scale attacks.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.285
So you're not doing shit?

15:13.454 --> 15:18.125
Look, <i>comandante, </i>in case you forgot,
you work for me.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.878
I own you. Don't play stupid.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.341
They're connecting the pieces.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.761
Anyone who was at Lope de Vega.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.388
You want to know what this is?

15:32.181 --> 15:33.265
Huh?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.725
It's revenge.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.270
Okay.

15:38.354 --> 15:42.066
Zuno's in hiding.
I'd recommend you join him.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.817
You're not safe here.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.571
Not an option.

15:47.655 --> 15:51.659
-Right now, my organization--
-The scumbag business goes on.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.620
Don't like my advice? Stick around.
See how it all plays out.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.748
Do you think I hired you
for your bullshit advice?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.292
Do your job.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.046
Next time I see you, I want a solution.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.091
Now, leave.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.146
Do you trust him?

16:21.605 --> 16:22.773
Hmm.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.608
I don't trust anyone, boss.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.906
-Who else knows about this?
-Just Calderoni.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.326
All right. It stays that way.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.705
The old man and the plazas can't find out,
or everything goes to shit.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.835
Let's hope this blows over
before I sit down with Cali.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.462
Do you think he can get it fixed?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.881
This mess with the Americans?

16:51.093 --> 16:53.137
Have them fuel the plane.
I'm getting my things.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.435
Fucking bastard.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.522
How much longer you wanna be here,
asshole?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.026
Who paid you?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.153
Answer, you fuck!

17:10.112 --> 17:12.531
- Give us names, you fucking bitch!

17:14.491 --> 17:15.868
It was Arévalo.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.707
They paid me.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.128
Said there'd be more work
as soon as it was done.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.759
It was just a job.

17:32.843 --> 17:33.886
Please...

17:35.512 --> 17:37.973
-I have children.
-You think I don't have children?

17:40.601 --> 17:41.852
How much did they pay you?

17:42.895 --> 17:46.398
-Two hundred and fifty thousand pesos.
-Son of a bitch.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.818
You are an idiot!

17:49.902 --> 17:52.071
If you'd come to me, asked,

17:52.154 --> 17:54.281
I'd have paid as much not to kill me.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.867
Now, because of you,
no one gets the money.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.203
Go on, do it.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.001
Give me a warning, asshole.

18:06.627 --> 18:10.714
What's wrong? Did your boots get dirty?

18:10.798 --> 18:12.508
Who the fuck is Arévalo?

18:12.591 --> 18:13.592
Does it matter?

18:14.176 --> 18:16.762
Little shit took a run at me last week.
Out on the highway.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.514
Damn near got me.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.100
Even worse, in a bus full of kids.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.103
What kids?

18:24.186 --> 18:26.939
Who the fuck is Arévalo,
and why does he want you dead?

18:29.483 --> 18:30.442
It's complicated.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.653
Told you it was Fermín.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.615
-Get moving.
-No, wait. Where to?

18:37.741 --> 18:41.078
-Enough with the questions.
-Then give me some answers!

18:41.870 --> 18:44.665
This about that feud, with the rancher?

18:46.875 --> 18:48.752
Time we bring this nonsense to an end.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.213
Before sundown...

18:52.131 --> 18:53.215
one of us dies.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.137
What? How-- Wait, wait.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.221
Pablo.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.974
Let me call in a team. We go in prepared.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.893
Let's not leave this shit
to a fucking psycho like Marco.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.272
-Sound good?
-Marco's involved. Important he be there.

19:08.939 --> 19:12.151
If you knew anything about honor,
you'd understand that.

19:12.234 --> 19:17.739
Don't give me that bullshit about honor.
You wanna kill that guy? Okay, sure.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.242
I'm in, okay? I'll help you.

19:21.118 --> 19:26.665
Just promise me, when this is over,
we go back to Juárez. Okay?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.003
If it goes the way I think it will...

19:32.713 --> 19:34.590
I'll need some rest.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.845
-The fuck are you doing?

19:39.928 --> 19:43.599
Mimi sure knows how to keep me up.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.373
It's fucking hot.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.418
Oh.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.170
Now that's an improvement.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.797
Had you pegged for a city guy.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.342
-Please, you see this tan?
-Is that what it is?

20:21.053 --> 20:24.223
-Oh, man, it's so nice here.
-All right, boys, stick to the plan!

20:24.306 --> 20:25.390
-All right.
-Yep.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.767
All right, I'm up front.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.811
What? Kenny, stick to the goddamn plan.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.898
No cowboy shit, man.
That's the plan. I'm with Danilo.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.193
All right, Amat, you're with me.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.118
You babysitting me now?

20:49.373 --> 20:51.375
This is gonna be so much fun.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.051
No one understands
what you do

21:01.134 --> 21:03.303
for this federation
more than me, Benjamín.

21:03.387 --> 21:08.642
And I need to know action's being taken
to resolve this shit.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.646
<i>They were out of line,</i>
<i>coming into your spot the way they did.</i>

21:12.729 --> 21:15.315
Those manners obviously
won't be tolerated.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.567
It was a disrespect
towards you and Pancho.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.736
<i>I've talked to Palma,</i>
<i>and it's been handled.</i>

21:19.820 --> 21:22.322
<i>But this bullshit between you guys,</i>
<i>it has to stop.</i>

21:22.990 --> 21:26.159
<i>It's not just them. It takes two to tango.</i>

21:26.243 --> 21:29.705
<i>-</i> <i>Félix, no--</i>
-Benjamín, each of you has a plaza.

21:32.249 --> 21:36.086
Jealousy hurts business. Money is lost.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.965
This comes to an end, today.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.601
Sorry, but it's not enough.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.061
The Sinaloans don't show us respect

21:53.145 --> 21:54.855
because you haven't given them
a reason to.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.525
<i>When you first came to my family,</i>
<i>you promised stability.</i>

21:59.026 --> 22:01.236
Growth. A better system.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.572
Listen, Benjamín...

22:04.906 --> 22:07.117
I'd be careful what you're saying.

22:07.701 --> 22:11.288
My family provides the infrastructure,
the transport.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.539
We do the work.

22:13.206 --> 22:18.170
<i>If this is about the money, then give us</i>
<i>an opportunity. We'll make you a lot more.</i>

22:18.837 --> 22:20.505
It's not so simple.

22:21.548 --> 22:25.344
<i>I know</i>
<i>it's getting harder to sell.</i>

22:29.222 --> 22:30.515
You heard about Ramón?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.352
Almost lost his eye in that fight.

22:34.061 --> 22:38.690
Doctor called him lucky. My brother,
in and out of the hospital.

22:43.653 --> 22:45.489
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.283
So, help me out, man.

22:53.413 --> 22:54.498
All right.

22:56.166 --> 23:00.420
A ten percent tax on anything Sinaloa
moves through your plaza.

23:03.715 --> 23:07.844
No more or less. I mean it.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.097
Consider it done.

23:50.804 --> 23:51.847
Pablo.

23:52.806 --> 23:53.807
Pablo!

23:54.474 --> 23:55.600
Wake up, asshole.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.349
I won, pussy!

24:37.017 --> 24:39.478
Lucky for me your aim sucks.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.314
You got me half asleep.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.525
Get over here, Dopey.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.860
Get that down!

24:47.444 --> 24:49.237
You're not going to heaven yet.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.033
Those guys...

24:54.576 --> 24:55.535
they're mine.

24:56.119 --> 24:59.581
We roll out to Fermín's ranch unarmed,
it won't be much of a fight, will it?

24:59.664 --> 25:01.124
What, you don't recognize Paco?

25:01.666 --> 25:02.834
It's me, dude.

25:06.046 --> 25:10.300
Desperate to get back to Juárez
and no idea who's there.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.594
Boy, some leader you'll be.

25:12.677 --> 25:13.803
Hey.

25:13.887 --> 25:16.848
You have any idea how many men
this Fermín guy has with him?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.645
How many guys work for Fermín?

25:22.604 --> 25:23.605
A shitload.

25:24.773 --> 25:25.899
See?

25:25.982 --> 25:28.360
That's why we need the big guns.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.156
This shit is insane, man.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.202
You're gonna go there
with your fucking honor

25:37.285 --> 25:39.204
and get us all killed.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.749
And I'm the idiot that's been
covering for you,

25:42.832 --> 25:45.085
telling Félix you had it
all under control.

25:45.168 --> 25:46.503
But the truth is, Pablo...

25:47.504 --> 25:50.632
you don't have a fucking clue
what you're doing.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.387
You think I give a fuck
what a crook thinks?

25:57.556 --> 26:00.141
-Ask your uncle what that gets you.
-Enough about my uncle.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.228
What happened with Félix,
that's between them.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.438
At least Félix knows who he is.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.234
Oh, yeah? What's that?

26:09.818 --> 26:13.029
You just said it, a crook. Just like you.

26:13.113 --> 26:15.156
We're all crooks. At least he knows it.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.243
I'm a bandit, not a crook.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.080
Like there's some difference.

26:22.914 --> 26:23.915
There is.

26:45.645 --> 26:46.771
My blanket.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.570
Gimme that.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.244
-Cheers, boys.
-Cheers.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.259
Mmm.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.938
...I don't know,
around seven Americans.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.732
Huh?

27:39.157 --> 27:40.450
Who said Americans?

27:44.537 --> 27:46.081
Baby, we're just talking.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.876
Did you or did you not mention Americans?

27:51.086 --> 27:54.297
Well, one of the girls at the club

27:54.381 --> 27:56.216
was telling me
she was with some Americans.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.511
Shit, I am talking!

28:07.435 --> 28:10.271
So, about these Americans...

28:11.189 --> 28:12.732
Baby, don't worry.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.485
You paid up front, so...

28:16.277 --> 28:17.487
we're all yours.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.656
Zuno, man!

28:19.739 --> 28:20.990
Zuno, man!

28:21.449 --> 28:23.368
They're hiding something from you, man.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.413
Not them!

28:26.496 --> 28:29.207
Those assholes over here!

28:29.708 --> 28:31.292
You need to see this.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.299
Holy shit.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.927
What the fuck is this?

28:42.637 --> 28:44.139
Nothing to worry about for now.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.766
We don't know who they are
or why they're here.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.062
How long they been out there?

28:51.146 --> 28:52.230
Two hours.

28:55.483 --> 28:57.402
And you were keeping this from me?

28:57.485 --> 28:59.988
This is bad, man, real bad.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.489
We need to be on this.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.867
I'm going to handle this.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.243
I'm going out there.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.828
Please don't.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.998
-You need to let me do my job.
-Do it then!

29:10.081 --> 29:12.876
-Go back in the pool.
-No, they're circling us, Zuno!

29:12.959 --> 29:15.628
There's more shit they aren't showing you.
Fucking show him, man!

29:15.712 --> 29:17.464
These guys don't respect you.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.342
Holy shit, there's more of them.

29:22.719 --> 29:23.928
They're running surveillance.

29:25.513 --> 29:28.516
Those fuckers are prepping for an assault.

29:29.267 --> 29:33.021
-Maybe or maybe not. We don't know.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.273
They know I'm here, man!

29:35.356 --> 29:36.941
They know I'm here!

29:37.025 --> 29:40.695
Who knows how many Americans
are out there,

29:41.654 --> 29:44.991
waiting to attack me like fucking Indians.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.868
Zuno, what are we gonna do?

29:46.951 --> 29:49.954
I'm gonna make some calls,
get some fucking answers.

29:58.755 --> 29:59.923
What'd he say?

30:04.093 --> 30:05.762
Agreed to a tax.

30:07.597 --> 30:10.767
Ten percent on anything the Sinaloans
move through the plaza.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.188
He flinched.

30:15.730 --> 30:16.773
Yep.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.027
So, what's our next move, Benjamín?

30:22.737 --> 30:24.906
We wait for things to improve.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.660
What do you mean, wait?

30:29.494 --> 30:31.204
That's enough for you?

30:31.913 --> 30:34.207
I just made this family a lot of money.

30:34.290 --> 30:37.502
Oh, yeah? And whose fucking idea was it
to use this as leverage?

30:38.711 --> 30:39.671
Yours.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.256
Hmm.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.592
Ramón's eye? Great touch.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.887
I've got a lot of good ideas.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.144
I can't keep apologizing for the world,
Enedina.

30:56.771 --> 30:57.981
I'm doing my best.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.410
The sister left 40 minutes ago.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.329
No one's come or gone since.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.622
Seen Fermín in there?

31:15.248 --> 31:16.374
Just Antonia.

31:16.916 --> 31:20.295
But... there's no way he left on foot.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.255
All right.

31:23.923 --> 31:26.092
Let me go down there, talk to him.

31:26.175 --> 31:29.596
Hey, hey. Wait, what's to say
this fucker doesn't blow your head off

31:29.679 --> 31:31.139
the second you walk up there?

31:32.640 --> 31:34.100
A hunch.

31:34.601 --> 31:35.727
A hunch?

31:37.562 --> 31:41.482
I'm coming with you.
Gotta make sure you don't get killed.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.193
So we can go back to Juárez?

31:45.653 --> 31:50.033
Tell me something.
Why do you care so much about Juárez?

31:50.116 --> 31:53.202
'Cause I'm not in the pride business
like you.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.789
We get Juárez going,
and I can get the fuck out of there.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.251
Juárez is my way to do what I want.

32:02.420 --> 32:07.050
Pathetic. At least it's finally the truth.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.760
Yeah, there you have it.

32:10.011 --> 32:12.555
Come on, leave that shit over there.

32:37.372 --> 32:41.709
<i>Drug traffickers roaming the halls</i>
<i>of Congress...</i>

32:44.337 --> 32:45.964
What's this republic come to?

32:47.006 --> 32:49.926
You've got a lot of balls walking in here.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.512
I'm doing my job.

32:53.012 --> 32:54.305
Protecting our business.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.766
That doesn't seem to be your priority
any longer.

32:58.184 --> 33:00.186
What are you doing
about the American operation?

33:01.062 --> 33:02.397
I've assigned Calderoni.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.773
It's not enough.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.151
Things are going to shit.

33:07.235 --> 33:10.154
The doctor, the <i>comandante...</i>

33:11.030 --> 33:17.912
The Americans are connecting the pieces.
Anyone tied to that agent is going down.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.290
Perhaps killing him was a mistake.

33:23.584 --> 33:26.796
But, as I recall, it was you who insisted
on returning the body.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.048
This is our mess.

33:30.466 --> 33:34.554
I'm respectfully asking for you
to do your job.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.556
I'd consider your tone.

33:37.348 --> 33:40.518
You're speaking
to Mexico's next president.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.312
That's right.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.942
You don't want this shit hanging
over your head when you're president.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.569
If the Americans--

33:49.652 --> 33:52.030
The Americans don't know
what they're doing.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.575
You think this'll stand?

33:57.952 --> 34:01.414
Kidnapping foreign nationals
from a sovereign country...

34:02.040 --> 34:05.752
this is bigger
than your fucking organization.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.172
My nephew's in hiding.

34:11.758 --> 34:14.635
I suggest you do the same
until this whole thing blows over.

34:15.678 --> 34:16.929
Run off.

34:17.597 --> 34:21.642
Scurry into the hole
rats like you crawled out of.

34:26.606 --> 34:27.690
No.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.695
Things are going to change.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.990
You see, right now my organization

34:36.074 --> 34:38.826
doesn't have the luxury
of going into hiding.

34:41.370 --> 34:44.290
I pay for protection,
and you will provide it.

34:49.212 --> 34:54.592
If you show up here again,
there'll be consequences.

35:02.725 --> 35:05.770
You know anything about ancient Rome?

35:06.521 --> 35:08.314
I guarantee more than you.

35:08.397 --> 35:10.525
I'm sure you do.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.111
It's just amazing, isn't it?

35:13.194 --> 35:15.154
What they did.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.824
Unite all the provinces.

35:18.324 --> 35:20.993
United the barbarians.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.495
And for what?

35:22.578 --> 35:25.706
So that all the money ends up
in one place:

35:25.790 --> 35:26.874
Rome.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.918
Pretty amazing.

35:32.755 --> 35:36.175
I've acquired the Gulf.

35:38.261 --> 35:41.806
Every trafficker in this country
now works for me.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.392
And you're Julius Caesar.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.271
I'd finish that book...

35:49.397 --> 35:51.399
so you know how it ends.

35:56.154 --> 36:00.116
This year,
Pemex earned four billion dollars.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.328
This country's biggest exporter.

36:07.123 --> 36:10.168
My organization made $15 billion dollars.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.046
I pull my money from your banks...

36:15.590 --> 36:17.675
this country crumbles.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.094
Overnight.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.765
I don't think you want to be president
of that country.

36:28.978 --> 36:31.230
You're going nowhere without my money.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.447
Fix this shit with the Americans.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.074
Protect me.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.456
Without me, you're nothing.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.222
Zuno, brother.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.850
Who do you keep calling? Huh?

37:07.934 --> 37:09.393
How can we help you?

37:09.477 --> 37:11.062
These guys are doing nothing!

37:11.687 --> 37:13.731
I'm calling to get some answers.

37:13.814 --> 37:16.192
-That's what I'm doing.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.069
Answer, you fuckers!

37:24.659 --> 37:25.701
He's calling again.

37:27.620 --> 37:28.955
Put him through.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.468
Hotel Américas, how can I help you?

37:42.551 --> 37:44.637
I need to speak to Miguel, now.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.723
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Félix is in a meeting.</i>

37:48.266 --> 37:49.392
Interrupt him.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.811
I'm sorry. That won't be possible.

37:51.894 --> 37:53.771
<i>I've been calling you guys...</i>

37:53.854 --> 37:57.024
I apologize, sir.
I'm happy to take a message.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.484
<i>May I ask who's calling?</i>

37:58.567 --> 38:02.697
Rubén. Rubén Zuno Arce.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.700
Tell him it's very important
that I speak to him.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.411
Rubén! We've been trying to reach you.

38:09.245 --> 38:14.000
No, no, no. Trying to reach me?

38:14.083 --> 38:17.586
No. I've been calling you like crazy!

38:17.670 --> 38:22.758
Yes, sorry. Mr. Félix asked me to pass
a message on to you as soon as you called.

38:22.842 --> 38:23.801
<i>Let's see...</i>

38:23.884 --> 38:27.221
<i>"They have the deed to the house,</i>
<i>Lope de Vega.</i>

38:27.305 --> 38:29.974
<i>The Americans, they know where you are."</i>

38:34.645 --> 38:37.106
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

38:37.606 --> 38:40.192
- What's up, Zuno?

38:40.276 --> 38:41.527
What did they say?

38:43.279 --> 38:44.196
Zuno?

38:45.406 --> 38:46.532
What's up?

38:51.954 --> 38:53.289
I have to go.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.626
I have to get out of here. Right now.

38:57.710 --> 39:01.714
Get the bags. We're fucking leaving.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.593
Let's go, fuckers!

39:08.012 --> 39:11.640
- Daryl, you talk to the boys?
-Yeah. We're good.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.893
Walt, this is Alex.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.562
Alex, this is the guy
I was telling you about.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.148
You clear on what we're asking?

39:20.399 --> 39:22.193
I mean, you think you can handle it?

39:22.777 --> 39:25.863
I've been doing it twice a week
for the past six months.

39:26.405 --> 39:27.448
Don't see why not.

39:29.241 --> 39:31.118
Your boy said there was
some money involved.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.623
You'll be compensated when it's done.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.753
See? I told you he was friendly.

40:19.708 --> 40:21.877
Come here to kill me too, Pablo?

40:24.755 --> 40:27.216
Time we buried the dead, Antonia.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.553
Moved on.

40:32.638 --> 40:33.931
I came here to talk.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.060
Fermín isn't home.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.812
Bullshit.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.565
Tell him to get out here.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.942
It's time we settled this shit.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.819
I told you, he isn't home.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.538
Got some nerve, bringing
that son of a bitch to my house.

40:58.456 --> 41:02.293
-I'm here to explain all that.
-What's to explain?

41:03.127 --> 41:04.753
How you two took my son?

41:06.672 --> 41:12.136
I know you think I had something to do
with killing Lili, but I didn't.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.597
Lili's wife was standing
right there with him.

41:15.181 --> 41:18.642
Saw that motherfucker put two
in my son's chest.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.395
Without my permission!

41:21.896 --> 41:23.564
I've gotten mad about it with him, too.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.068
Lili was stealing from us, Antonia.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.822
Got people killed for his lies.

41:34.742 --> 41:37.286
But he's never coming home, hmm?

41:39.371 --> 41:42.583
So to hell with you,
and all you say he did.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.508
All right then.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.012
If you think it'll help him rest...

42:06.649 --> 42:07.775
...go ahead then.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.194
Kill me.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.281
It's all you gotta do to end this.

42:24.500 --> 42:25.709
Pull the trigger!

42:29.421 --> 42:30.589
End this!

42:35.427 --> 42:36.679
It's not my responsibility, Pablo.

42:41.517 --> 42:44.144
Only you or Fermín can end this.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.524
Otherwise, this will never end.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.656
The hell with it, then.

43:04.206 --> 43:05.958
Guess I'll see you.

43:08.669 --> 43:10.129
No, Pablo.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.591
I don't think so.

43:23.601 --> 43:24.935
He's not inside.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.146
He's out there waiting for us.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.317
He'll try and take us on the road.

43:32.401 --> 43:34.653
So all this shit is because
you murdered their son.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.072
How's your shot?

43:38.324 --> 43:41.201
Need you up top, Marco up front.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.911
Fuck that, why me?

43:44.538 --> 43:46.540
It's your job to protect me, isn't it?

43:49.376 --> 43:51.086
Move that shit over.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.257
Keep your eyes on the horizon.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.550
What am I looking for?

43:57.092 --> 43:58.719
You'll know when you see it.

44:01.847 --> 44:04.892
Sir, I'm asking you
not to leave the premises.

44:06.685 --> 44:09.563
See, if you stay inside,
I can control the situation.

44:10.439 --> 44:11.899
That's bullshit.

44:13.734 --> 44:15.861
I need to go, that's what I need to do.

44:15.944 --> 44:18.238
I need to get the fuck out of here.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.948
Sir, listen to me.

44:21.867 --> 44:22.910
Sir.

44:25.412 --> 44:28.832
If you insist on leaving, at least let me
find out what's happening out there!

44:28.916 --> 44:32.586
Oh, gonna start doing your job? Fuck you!

44:32.670 --> 44:33.754
You wait for my "clear."

44:33.837 --> 44:36.882
Fuck the "clear,"
just start the fucking car!

44:36.965 --> 44:38.425
Useless asshole.

44:40.886 --> 44:42.388
Let's get the fuck out of here.

44:45.057 --> 44:46.725
Man, we got activity.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.311
They're blocking us in.

44:51.271 --> 44:53.399
Don't move! Show me your hands!

44:59.655 --> 45:01.407
Let me see some identification.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.617
Good afternoon,
is there a problem?

45:04.743 --> 45:08.831
They got you now, pussies!

45:22.970 --> 45:24.596
Let's go!

45:25.931 --> 45:27.850
Secure the plane! Fast!

45:27.933 --> 45:29.935
Open the fucking door!

45:30.477 --> 45:32.104
-Do you have a gun?
-Yes.

45:32.187 --> 45:33.397
Sir!

45:33.480 --> 45:35.524
Thank you for nothing.

45:36.316 --> 45:38.819
From now on, my guys take care of things.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.700
Go fuck yourself, corporal.

45:47.035 --> 45:48.412
Let's go, Dani!

45:52.750 --> 45:55.919
-Do you know the itinerary?
-I've got it memorized, sir!

45:56.003 --> 45:57.337
All right, let's go!

46:03.969 --> 46:06.346
All right, here we go.
The honeymooners.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.057
-What are we drinking?
-Whatever you want. You're paying.

46:09.516 --> 46:12.019
-Says the guy who did nothing.

46:12.102 --> 46:13.604
- How are you, cousin?
-Hey.

46:14.146 --> 46:16.231
Thank you for your help, cousin.

46:16.315 --> 46:18.942
Cece, Kenny.
Kenny, my cousin, Cece.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.403
Nice to meet you.

46:21.487 --> 46:24.114
So, uh, did you talk to Walt?

46:24.656 --> 46:25.532
Yeah.

46:26.533 --> 46:28.118
Zuno's on the one-way.

46:29.119 --> 46:30.954
Everything went smoothly.

46:31.830 --> 46:33.123
All right.

46:33.999 --> 46:37.419
Well, to the smash-and-grab crew.

46:38.712 --> 46:39.922
All growed up.

46:41.131 --> 46:42.007
<i>Salud, </i>you guys.

46:42.090 --> 46:44.051
<i>♪ One, two, three, four ♪</i>

47:12.287 --> 47:13.747
How's it going, Amelia?

47:13.831 --> 47:15.749
- Welcome back, sir.
-Any calls?

47:15.833 --> 47:18.502
Yes, Héctor Palma called a few times.

47:18.585 --> 47:19.503
Okay.

47:29.888 --> 47:31.348
Open the door.

47:33.475 --> 47:34.852
Who are they, Zuno?

47:34.935 --> 47:37.563
Where the fuck are we?

47:38.438 --> 47:40.399
The fuck did they take us?

47:41.692 --> 47:43.235
Pilot?

47:43.318 --> 47:44.403
Let's go!

47:44.486 --> 47:45.821
Don't open the door!

47:45.904 --> 47:47.072
Pilot!

47:52.411 --> 47:53.704
Welcome to Texas, boys!

47:58.083 --> 47:59.459
You got a permit for that weapon, son?

48:00.127 --> 48:02.170
Put it on the ground, now!

48:06.758 --> 48:08.302
Put your hands behind your head!

48:09.553 --> 48:10.762
Your head!

48:18.770 --> 48:21.899
Hey, bud. Looks like
they're waiting for you down there.

48:24.693 --> 48:27.738
-You can't do this.
-Yeah, well, I just did.

50:27.774 --> 50:29.901
We have to move, or we're gonna die.

50:31.903 --> 50:35.407
You see that tractor? Get to it.

50:47.586 --> 50:49.379
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

50:57.054 --> 50:58.346
Move, man!

51:23.830 --> 51:24.664
Pablo!

51:26.500 --> 51:27.709
Pablo!

52:33.942 --> 52:36.695
Praying for this asshole?

52:39.990 --> 52:44.578
When I first got into the game,
I was a stupid kid.

52:46.621 --> 52:50.834
Must have been 20 when I got popped
crossing the bridge, over in Tabalaopa.

52:52.669 --> 52:54.462
It was just my second run.

52:56.131 --> 53:01.428
Twelve ounces of heroin,
duct-taped to my arm.

53:03.180 --> 53:05.307
Some genius, huh?

53:07.559 --> 53:12.230
Didn't have a penny. Sure as hell
wasn't paying for a fucking lawyer.

53:15.984 --> 53:17.444
Fermín walks in...

53:18.612 --> 53:20.155
pulls out his wallet.

53:21.990 --> 53:22.991
He says...

53:24.784 --> 53:29.372
"You're not dying in here for 12 ounces."

53:34.169 --> 53:35.921
He gave me my life back.

53:39.633 --> 53:42.302
So you owed him.
What all this was really about...

53:47.432 --> 53:52.229
This nonsense with Fermín, I started it.
Was on me to finish.

53:57.567 --> 54:00.946
Only thing that keeps order
in this game...

54:03.114 --> 54:04.491
it's respect.

54:08.203 --> 54:09.704
Fermín was a father...

54:11.998 --> 54:15.293
a husband,
before he was ever a trafficker.

54:17.462 --> 54:21.216
He deserves to leave this world
with respect.

54:37.315 --> 54:38.441
Hello?

54:38.525 --> 54:39.609
<i>How's it going?</i>

54:40.110 --> 54:41.361
<i>How are they?</i>

54:41.444 --> 54:44.364
They're good. They ask about you.

54:46.992 --> 54:49.202
It's late. They've gone to bed.

54:49.286 --> 54:50.912
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

54:52.956 --> 54:54.791
<i>I'm just calling to...</i>

54:57.168 --> 54:59.921
<i>They got the gifts?</i>

55:00.005 --> 55:02.299
Abril loves her doll.

55:03.300 --> 55:04.342
All right.

55:08.638 --> 55:10.265
Thank you, Manuela.

55:10.348 --> 55:11.725
<i>Good night, sir.</i>

55:12.851 --> 55:14.060
Good night.

55:39.711 --> 55:41.671
It was him again, wasn't it?

55:42.297 --> 55:44.215
Asking about the gifts.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.176
Tell him not to send more.

55:51.931 --> 55:54.392
The next time he calls, you tell him.
