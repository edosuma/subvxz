00:01.960 --> 00:05.230
I'm not goa deal with that right now,so don't call back.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.980
I'm dealing with something extremely important.

00:07.990 --> 00:09.010
Be careful of this one.

00:09.020 --> 00:09.900
He'll make you a ton of money,

00:09.910 --> 00:11.430
and then you'll never want to let him go.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.260
That's right.

00:12.270 --> 00:14.380
I was in love with a man.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.200
Why didn't you tell me?

00:16.210 --> 00:18.480
Ten years ago,you outed my brother.

00:18.490 --> 00:19.850
It devastated him.

00:19.860 --> 00:23.600
Any idealism I had was completely obliterated by what you did.

00:23.610 --> 00:25.060
I don't trust you,david.

00:25.070 --> 00:27.580
You still haven't told me why you suddenly am*,

00:27.590 --> 00:29.710
l no s at my house and my place of business.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.690
Mom,there's no way that.

00:31.700 --> 00:32.729
I mean,he couldn'T.

00:32.740 --> 00:34.220
oh,god,no.

00:34.340 --> 00:38.140
William walker was your father.

00:40.010 --> 00:41.480
how's the hollandaise sauce coming?

00:41.490 --> 00:42.550
Almost done.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.690
Let me taste it.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.870
Oh,sweetheart,that's fabulous.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.690
You're turning into a really good cook.

00:49.700 --> 00:50.680
Well,you did all the cooking.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.390
I just whisked.You know what?

00:52.610 --> 00:54.370
I'm gonna ask kevin to talk to scoy about

00:54.380 --> 00:56.590
gettg you in as a trainee at the restaurant.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.730
Oh,god,not you,too.

00:57.740 --> 00:59.070
You sound like my mom.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.530
She's all over me about finding a direction.

01:01.540 --> 01:04.319
Apparently,everybody thinks I'm an aimless loser.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.060
Hey,aimless loser is my job.

01:06.070 --> 01:07.490
Speaking of jobs,I--

01:07.500 --> 01:08.860
talking about her.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.420
You know what? Photography.

01:11.470 --> 01:14.860
You were carryg around that camera with you all last summeR.

01:14.870 --> 01:16.050
But that's not a job.

01:16.060 --> 01:17.010
That's,like,a hobby.

01:17.020 --> 01:18.630
Photography can be a job.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.850
Know what? This is delicious.

01:21.860 --> 01:23.400
Maybe I should just stick to whisking.

01:23.410 --> 01:24.900
Well,you better be careful.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.950
You don't want to whisk your le.

01:30.060 --> 01:32.240
with the michigan primary only a week ay,

01:32.250 --> 01:35.600
republican front-runner robert mccallister is facing increasing pressure

01:35.610 --> 01:37.650
from dark horse candidate boyd taylor.

01:37.890 --> 01:41.670
Following an onslaught of attack ads airing in michigan this past week,

01:41.680 --> 01:43.700
congressman taylor has pulled to within

01:43.710 --> 01:46.470
a single percentage point of the california senator.

01:51.740 --> 01:53.140
how--how did we not see this coming?

01:53.150 --> 01:54.490
I mean,taylor just pulled up out of nowhere,

01:54.500 --> 01:56.860
and he goes from zero to 90 in-- in less than 2 weeks?

01:56.870 --> 01:59.840
We took a risk-- you know,lay low,let the other guys pick each other off,

01:59.850 --> 02:01.810
and then go after the ones who are remaining standing.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.890
That's how he stole iowa right out from underneath us.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.230
Wait a minute.Let's not forget that we did win wyoming.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.580
Which is a very good indication that we are gonna take the west.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.110
We just need to trust our strategy.

02:10.120 --> 02:10.840
Really?

02:11.090 --> 02:15.400
Because you all told me to focus on adamson and burgess-- ignore the rest of 'em,

02:15.410 --> 02:18.890
those were the two to pay attention to--and then taylor ambushes us in iowa.

02:18.900 --> 02:22.510
We also advised you to reveal the truth about adamson,and you didn't,

02:22.520 --> 02:25.950
which gave taylor the opportunity to reveal it on his own schedule.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.020
And even worse,it let taylor see what kind of campaign you're running.

02:29.030 --> 02:30.270
And what kind of campaign is that?

02:30.280 --> 02:33.580
Robert,taking the high road doesn't always get you where you want to go.

02:33.590 --> 02:36.000
If anybody has any qualms about the way I'm running this campaign.

02:36.010 --> 02:37.010
- Wait a minute,robert.
- Remember that I'm the candidate.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.240
Nobody has any qualms.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.380
We're just all very stressed out.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.290
Now what we need to do is,weeed to change the itinerary.

02:43.300 --> 02:47.360
Michigan's primary is next week,and we just need to focus all of our efforts right there.

02:47.370 --> 02:49.640
No,I already scheduled a huge rally in new york.

02:49.650 --> 02:52.050
Well,reschedule.Taylor is making a big push in michigan,

02:52.060 --> 02:53.640
and I say that we have to push back.

02:53.650 --> 02:55.120
We need to go into super tuesday strong,

02:55.130 --> 02:56.340
not playing catch-up.

02:56.350 --> 03:00.000
And don't forget governor bryant is going to endorse robert,

03:00.010 --> 03:01.570
and we could have a really nice press conference.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.720
Well,bryant is certainly taking is time.

03:04.190 --> 03:05.860
Uh,you sure you can count on him?

03:05.870 --> 03:07.550
Yeah,I've known michael since boot camp.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.380
If he says he's gonna endorse,he's gonna endorse.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.740
Travis,tell the staff we're going to michigan,all right?

03:11.750 --> 03:12.660
We're traveling.

03:12.670 --> 03:16.570
I'll postpone my trip to california,oversee the new initiative.

03:18.910 --> 03:20.690
We just have to keep the faith.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.150
You sound like jason.

03:22.490 --> 03:24.620
He always told me until the last votes are cast,

03:24.630 --> 03:26.450
that I needed to hold on to my faith.

03:27.490 --> 03:32.440
Well,jason happens to be a very,very wise man.

03:33.210 --> 03:35.320
Did you know that I haven't even seen him since he's been back?

03:35.330 --> 03:36.650
I haven't seen my kids since the wedding.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.790
I probably wouldn't even see you if you didn't work for me.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.740
All right,I gotta go pack.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.240
I'm so over it.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.470
It'sike,the nicer the car,the smaller thtip.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.730
Mario is a valet at the beverly hills hotel.

03:53.970 --> 03:55.360
I-I-I love that place.

03:55.370 --> 03:57.040
I take a lot of clients to the polo lounge.

03:57.050 --> 03:58.490
How can you even breathe in that place?

03:58.500 --> 03:59.870
So many stuffed shirts.

04:01.040 --> 04:01.840
Well,where do you want him to go?

04:01.850 --> 04:03.140
He's a lawyer,jordan.

04:03.150 --> 04:05.470
They--they actually do a-a great burger.

04:06.510 --> 04:07.850
gentlemen!

04:07.860 --> 04:09.320
Q.You made it.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.460
Um,quinn,this is kevin.

04:11.470 --> 04:13.410
Oh,the infamous kevin.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.070
Quinn is one of the promors here.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.790
We're doing karaoke night tomorrow.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.730
It is gonna be off the chain.

04:19.769 --> 04:22.460
All righ you know what? I'm--I'm not actually a-a karaoke.

04:22.690 --> 04:23.950

04:32.090 --> 04:32.990
good morning.

04:33.000 --> 04:33.880
Morning.

04:35.130 --> 04:36.490
Do you mind if I.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.040
uh,go right ahead.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.920
Ibuprofen's my favorite.

04:41.930 --> 04:43.480
Did you just take four?

04:44.030 --> 04:46.020
I was trying to,uh,keep with the,

04:46.680 --> 04:48.660
uh,these crazy kids from singapore last night.

04:48.670 --> 04:51.130
Man,these venture capitalists can drink.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.430
they bought themselves a start-up airline,

04:53.720 --> 04:55.440
and they've been thinking about providing healthier meals.

04:55.450 --> 04:59.130
And I thought,well,there might be something in it for ojai.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.990
Are you serious?

05:01.680 --> 05:03.580
what? That's why you brought me on,right?

05:03.590 --> 05:06.060
Help explore new business possibilities,right?

05:06.070 --> 05:09.370
Yes,and if th have anything to do with ojai or the future of ojai,

05:09.380 --> 05:11.290
I would appreciate an invite.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.640
oh,sarah,come on.

05:12.650 --> 05:14.530
Listen,these-- these guys are savages.

05:14.870 --> 05:18.590
The heavy drinking is not optional,and the entertainment is.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.010
you're far too respectable.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.630
How many strip joints did you go to,exactly?

05:24.020 --> 05:25.400
sarah walker?

05:25.890 --> 05:27.280
Thank you.

05:36.350 --> 05:40.900
Oh,it's-- it's just my divorce papers are finally ready for me to sign.

05:41.580 --> 05:44.600
Well,th-that's fairly significant.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.500
It's's not exactly unexpected.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.370
All right.

05:50.380 --> 05:52.030
I'm here if you need me.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.320
Oh,look,I'm stuffing my shirt.

06:13.330 --> 06:15.830
Okay,I know my friends weren't the warmest last night.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.380
I should have worn a parka.

06:17.390 --> 06:18.980
They were just being protective.

06:19.350 --> 06:20.650
From what? Me?

06:20.660 --> 06:23.990
You have to admit,our history has been a little bit checkered.

06:24.470 --> 06:27.270
I'm not solely responsible for the checkering,okay?

06:27.630 --> 06:28.880
You tell 'em any of the good stuff?

06:28.890 --> 06:31.970
Yes.They just happen to remember the other stuff.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.350
They--they'll warm up to you.You're different.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.570
They're more.

06:35.580 --> 06:36.470
bohemian.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.820
Come on,admit it.They just think I'm boring.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.600
No,they just think you're.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.530
uptight.

06:43.390 --> 06:45.040
I am not uptight.

06:45.050 --> 06:46.980
Okay.Whatever you need to tell yourself.

06:47.310 --> 06:49.780
Okay,fine.I'll see you after my long,uptight day at work.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.450
At least they think you're cute.

06:54.980 --> 06:57.000
5:50 A.M.,Waffle emporium.

06:57.010 --> 07:00.190
Construction,trucking and shift workers make up the early morning breakfast crowd.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.500
Hey,where's kitty?

07:01.510 --> 07:02.490
She should be here by now.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.120
She told me she had something to do.

07:04.130 --> 07:06.160
I get very nervous when kitty's vague.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.940
So after breakfast,we head out to the dearborn fair,

07:08.950 --> 07:12.150
and then we're gonna go to the saginaw wildlife field office

07:12.160 --> 07:15.090
for a q&a with a hunters group.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.090
Hey,maybe we can do a photo op-- you know,

07:17.100 --> 07:19.150
you,rifle in one hand,deer or e--

07:19.160 --> 07:20.360
it's--it's too late.

07:20.370 --> 07:21.650
It's small game season.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.310
Squirrels,bobtail rabbits.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.550
Yeah,it's not very manly to kill thumper.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.520
Any luck with scheduling a meeting with the governor?

07:27.530 --> 07:30.540
Oh,his office is checking into available times,or so they claim.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.900
You know what? I'm gonna call him personally.

07:33.450 --> 07:34.760
Finally!

07:35.220 --> 07:36.640
What was so important?

07:37.520 --> 07:39.080
daddy!

07:40.170 --> 07:42.150
Oh,what a great surprise!

07:42.160 --> 07:43.170
Wait a minute.

07:43.180 --> 07:44.730
There's--there's more.

07:45.740 --> 07:46.460
Robbie!

07:46.470 --> 07:48.200
Jason.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.360
not a bad idea,huh?

07:59.430 --> 08:00.130
What?

08:00.140 --> 08:04.320
Kitty,remember his brother being outed during robert's first campaign?

08:04.730 --> 08:05.980
Yeah?

08:09.800 --> 08:11.910
Wh-- that was you?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.530
all right,if I get this one.

08:25.540 --> 08:27.600
Robert's gonna take michigan.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.900
And if I make this one,

08:31.910 --> 08:35.549
it confirms that tossing rings can't predict the future.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.490
all right,I'll stop.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.350
Good idea to bring the kids.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.820
Robert seems more relaxed than he's been for a while.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.650
So when are you headed back to california?

08:45.660 --> 08:46.760
Ah,in couple of days.

08:46.770 --> 08:49.450
Well,good,'cause we need you coordinating the super tuesday push,

08:49.460 --> 08:53.770
and--and I just don't think it's a good idea for you to be here when jason's here.

08:55.090 --> 08:57.250
Robert and I have come to terms with it.

08:58.290 --> 08:59.360
Good.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.650
Are-- are you having a good time?

09:02.660 --> 09:03.730
My head hurts.

09:03.740 --> 09:04.510
Oh,no.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.320
I don't think they're feeling well.

09:05.330 --> 09:06.410
Maybe have a fever or something.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.470
Maybe we should pickp some aspirin on the way to your next appointment,

09:09.480 --> 09:10.760
which we are already 20 minutes late for.

09:10.770 --> 09:12.730
Why don't I just take them back to the hotel?

09:12.740 --> 09:14.550
you know what.Kitty? I'll go with you.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.600
Great.Excellent.

09:15.610 --> 09:17.520
Okay,guys,I'll see you back there.

09:17.530 --> 09:18.980
I love you,daddy.

09:20.020 --> 09:23.610
Okay,well,let's,uh,get you back to the hotel and put you to bed,

09:23.620 --> 09:25.190
and I'll get you some hot chocolate.

09:25.650 --> 09:28.440
I was very surprised that you had time for lunch.

09:28.770 --> 09:29.620
Why?

09:29.630 --> 09:31.230
I always have time for you,saul.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.690
And then a lot of my family and loved ones are not even in the state,so.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.340
you mean isaac?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.710
I remember when you first started dating william,

09:38.720 --> 09:40.650
I didn't see you for many months.

09:40.660 --> 09:41.970
Really?

09:44.790 --> 09:47.880
isaac is very busy,and so we.

09:47.890 --> 09:49.930
have to take it very slow.

09:49.940 --> 09:51.470
I see.

09:51.830 --> 09:53.350
Why are you smiling?

09:53.360 --> 09:56.860
I just thought how much fun it would be to tell mother about your new boyfriend.

09:57.870 --> 09:59.410
I really don't care what anyone thinks.

09:59.420 --> 10:02.680
I only care what I think and what isaac thinks.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.060
And you know what?

10:05.070 --> 10:06.320
What?

10:06.610 --> 10:11.940
I have a family who loves me,and they're happy when I'm happy.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.620
So this is no longer about you and isaac.Right?

10:16.630 --> 10:18.850
No,saul,it isn'T.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.460
I am your sister.

10:20.470 --> 10:23.500
I love you in a very nonjudgmental way.

10:23.510 --> 10:26.450
If there's ever anything you want to talk to me about.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.340
I want to tell you that you are my little sister,

10:32.350 --> 10:34.680
and I do love you,and I want you to have your lunch.

10:45.390 --> 10:46.610
hey,david.

10:46.620 --> 10:47.980
Hey,come on in.

10:47.990 --> 10:48.980
Did you bring your camera?

10:48.990 --> 10:50.690
Yeah,I have it,and thank you so much.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.240
I'm really excited to go out.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.820
Please.My social calendar is humiliatingly empty.

10:54.830 --> 10:56.090
You're doing me a favor.

10:56.460 --> 10:58.480
So what's the sudden interest in photography?

10:58.490 --> 11:00.130
You trying to avoid getting a real job?

11:00.590 --> 11:01.720
Something like that.

11:01.730 --> 11:02.530
Look at this.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.550
It's probably older than you are.

11:07.480 --> 11:11.560
"1998." well,that was a gooyear.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.370
so when did you get into photography?

11:16.380 --> 11:17.420
Who cares?

11:17.430 --> 11:18.800
Come on,let's go.

11:18.810 --> 11:19.870
Where are we going?

11:19.880 --> 11:20.870
We're gonna go take some pictures.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.360
Let me see your camera.

11:26.980 --> 11:29.510
first lesson--you always take it off automatic.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.810
You only shoot manual.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.920
Trust me.It's gonna change the way you see things.

11:32.930 --> 11:34.140
Cool.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.770
and that's just meant to be okay,that you're takingaula?

11:39.310 --> 11:40.670
Look,fine.

11:41.940 --> 11:43.250
Do you think I'm uptight?

11:43.260 --> 11:44.450
Yes.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.060
W-why?'Cause I wear a suit?

11:46.070 --> 11:46.790
Come on,kevin.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.870
I'm not in the mood for one of your neurotic freak-outs.

11:50.260 --> 11:51.890
What's wrong with you?

11:52.610 --> 11:55.600
Joe is taking paula to paris for her birthday.

11:55.610 --> 11:56.400
So?

11:56.410 --> 12:00.580
So I told joe that i wanted to be whisked off to paris for my birthday.

12:01.060 --> 12:02.660
Well,she stole my present.

12:02.670 --> 12:05.010
Or he stole it and gave it to her.

12:05.020 --> 12:06.940
Did you get the divorce papers I sent you?

12:06.950 --> 12:08.360
Don't change the subject.

12:08.370 --> 12:09.640
Did you sign them?

12:10.520 --> 12:11.830
I will.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.250
later.

12:13.620 --> 12:15.070
I've been busy.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.280
- should go out.
- No.

12:19.290 --> 12:20.400
You're uptight.

12:20.410 --> 12:21.740
I'm not going to paris.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.460
This deserves an outing.

12:23.470 --> 12:24.460
You and me,tonight.

12:24.470 --> 12:25.410
We can commiserate.

12:25.420 --> 12:26.480
I don't need to commiserate.

12:26.490 --> 12:28.870
Then watch me commiserate with a bottle of tequila.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.320
You don't need a brother.You need to t lucky.

12:30.330 --> 12:32.320
Oh,come on.It's not my senior prom.

12:32.330 --> 12:36.970
I just--I want to go out,let my hair down and get savage.

12:36.980 --> 12:38.040
Okay,now you're scaring me.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.150
That's because you're uptight.

12:39.160 --> 12:39.830
I am--

12:39.840 --> 12:41.510
come on,kevin.We're walkers.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.960
Let's go do what walkers do best.

12:43.970 --> 12:45.420
Get drunk?

12:46.860 --> 12:47.580
Okay.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.940
But I get to pick the place.

12:51.310 --> 12:52.480
okay,um-- look at this.

12:52.490 --> 12:54.810
You are all over the local news.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.960
Take that,boyd taylor!

12:56.970 --> 12:58.060
You know what? We are winning this thing.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.500
We are gonna kill him in michigan,

12:59.510 --> 13:02.560
and then we're gonna drag his bloody carcass through every primary state

13:02.570 --> 13:05.680
till there's nothing left but a mangled flag lapel pin.

13:05.690 --> 13:06.790
I gotta hand it to kitty.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.800
Bringing the kids was a stroke of genius,

13:08.810 --> 13:10.760
walking petri dishes that they are.

13:10.770 --> 13:12.890
Oh,and are they feeng better?

13:12.900 --> 13:14.340
I spoke to the governor.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.250
He'll see me tonight,late.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.540
Oh,under cover of darkness.Interesting.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.030
Kid update-- fevers are dropping.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.790
Noses are running.Just your run-of-the-mill flu.

13:23.030 --> 13:24.070
How's kitty holding up?

13:24.080 --> 13:26.880
Good now that the cold medicine's kicking in and the kids are getting drowsy.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.320
You know what? I'm gonna catch a couple hours sleep myself.

13:29.670 --> 13:30.990
Wear a face mask.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.140
Hey,put jason to work.

13:33.150 --> 13:33.990
Whatever you need.

13:34.000 --> 13:34.870
Yeah,okay.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.240
"women's baptist group"?

13:38.250 --> 13:39.320
Easy.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.250
All I need is the collar,the smile.

13:41.540 --> 13:43.950
you know,last time I campaigned for robert,I learned how to quilt.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.500
Yeah,but this is the midwest,not california.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.880
You know what? I'm gonna be blunt.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.920
If you want robert to win,you're gonna have to lay low.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.010
Want to run that advice by robert?

13:54.020 --> 13:55.750
Oh,believe me,he doesn't want to know.

13:55.760 --> 13:59.060
But he's willing to make concessions to win,like hiring isaac.

13:59.620 --> 14:01.750
I'm surprised you're being such a good sport about it.

14:02.260 --> 14:03.130
Why wouldn't I be?

14:03.830 --> 14:06.190
You've really got this whole forgiveness thing down,don't you?

14:06.710 --> 14:09.530
I'd want to kill the man who outed me.

14:11.010 --> 14:12.910
Isaac outed me?

14:17.520 --> 14:20.410
Now that is a photo.

14:22.620 --> 14:26.430
They are just like these-- these little angels.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.240
Well,the demons only appear during waking hours.

14:33.030 --> 14:34.800
My,um,my allergies are acting up.

14:34.810 --> 14:36.560
Hey,I can get us a sitter service if you want.

14:36.570 --> 14:39.170
No,no.I don't want to dump 'em with a sitter.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.890
I like being their stepmom.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.900
hey,you don't mind if I get some sleep in the other room,do you?

14:45.910 --> 14:47.050
Uh,no.No,no.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.150
I don't-- I don't want you to get sick.

14:50.370 --> 14:52.180
But you could always come visit me.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.520
What?

14:56.130 --> 14:57.890
Yeah,you are just burning up.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.110
I am?

14:59.120 --> 15:00.220
No,I'm not.I'm totally fine.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.330
I'm just achy and tired from all the travel,

15:02.340 --> 15:05.910
and my allergies are starting to act up because we're in a new place,

15:05.920 --> 15:09.770
and my voice is scratchy because I talk.a lot.

15:09.860 --> 15:13.170
And I'- I've cght their flu.

15:15.670 --> 15:17.050
I'm sorry.

15:20.830 --> 15:21.750
oh,here you go,sweetie.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.550
Oh,thanks.These movies are stupid.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.250
Wait,"pirates.I want to watch "pirates.

15:25.260 --> 15:27.380
No! I don't want to watch that.

15:27.390 --> 15:28.680
I don't care!

15:29.260 --> 15:32.630
Hey,guys,you guys,let's just take turns,okay?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.020
Just watch something,anything.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.060
no,no!

15:46.070 --> 15:47.340
You said we could pick anything.

15:47.350 --> 15:49.790
yeah,I meant anything that was age-appropriate.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.650
Now--now that-- that show is for grown-ups.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.600
It's for grown-ups who love each other and--

15:54.610 --> 15:57.880
and love to watch other grown-ups who love each other.

15:59.110 --> 15:59.830
never mind.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.000
Oh,look,cartoons.

16:01.010 --> 16:02.380
That'll cancel out what you just saw.

16:02.390 --> 16:04.320
No,wa a minute.I'm taking the remote.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.800
I'm going to the bathroom.

16:05.810 --> 16:08.870
I'm going to get some medicine,and I will be right back.

16:08.970 --> 16:10.530
Okay?

16:14.920 --> 16:15.740
hello?

16:15.750 --> 16:16.510
hey,mom.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.000
Sweetheart,you sound terrible.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.220
Oh,I know,I know.

16:19.230 --> 16:20.470
I'm sick.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.560
Well,drink lots of water and get into bed.

16:22.570 --> 16:23.470
I-I am.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.480
It just that,you know,the kids are sick,too,

16:25.490 --> 16:27.660
and they're not letting me get any sleep,and you know what?

16:27.670 --> 16:29.140
I don't know how to make them feel better.

16:29.150 --> 16:34.340
And didn't you tell me once that grandma gave you some brandy or somethi?

16:34.350 --> 16:38.230
Yes,but that was a different era,and she was a terrible mother.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.290
Right,she was.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.280
Okay,fine.So I can't do that.

16:41.890 --> 16:43.350
Where's robert?

16:43.700 --> 16:45.110
everyone is out campaigning.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.460
I know isaac is.

16:46.470 --> 16:48.350
I only got to talk to him for ten minutes today.

16:48.360 --> 16:49.250
Mom,please.

16:49.260 --> 16:50.580
I don't want to talk about isaac.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.770
I just want to talk about me.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.730
Kitty,do you remember when you had the chicken pox?

16:59.220 --> 17:00.450
Yes.

17:00.460 --> 17:04.140
You made me chicken soup,and you put cold compresses on my head,

17:04.150 --> 17:07.790
and you rubbed calamine lotion all over my body.

17:07.800 --> 17:11.670
Yes,but what you don't remember is when you had the chicken pox,

17:12.010 --> 17:13.410
sarah had the chicken pox,

17:13.420 --> 17:14.589
and tommy had the chicken pox,

17:14.599 --> 17:15.760
and kevin had the chicken pox.

17:15.770 --> 17:17.349
And I had a very bad cold.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.450
Your dad was out of town on business.

17:20.170 --> 17:23.990
Sweetheart,I'm saying this to you with as much love as I possibly can.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.420
Sometimes motherhood means sucking it up.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.610
Kitty,go suck it up.

17:29.620 --> 17:30.760
Oh,great.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.760
Well,thank you,mom.

17:31.770 --> 17:33.330
Good night,sweetheart.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.640
I'm sorry.I was expecting milo.

17:52.650 --> 17:54.460
Milo's out of town for a few weeks.

17:54.470 --> 17:56.040
Italy,the lucky dog.

17:56.050 --> 17:58.660
Well,would you tell him that I stopped by,please?

17:58.670 --> 18:00.070
My name is saul.

18:01.310 --> 18:02.040
You're saul.

18:02.050 --> 18:03.070
Yeah,I'm--I'm saul.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.450
Milo told me about you.

18:04.970 --> 18:06.510
I'm evan,by the way.

18:06.930 --> 18:08.730
Milo's just letting me stay herwhile he's gone.

18:08.740 --> 18:09.430
Nice to meet you.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.360
Likewise.

18:10.370 --> 18:11.280
Well,why don't you come in for a minute,

18:11.290 --> 18:13.720
and I'll get you the number of the hotel where he's staying?

18:13.730 --> 18:16.740
Apparently,he managed to drown his cell phone in the trevi fountain.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.590
did he? That's funny.

18:18.840 --> 18:19.770
No,you know what,evan?

18:19.780 --> 18:20.690
I don't want to trouble you.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.650
No,no,it's no trouble.

18:21.660 --> 18:24.890
Just give me a second to sort through the rubble that is my life.

18:24.900 --> 18:25.670
Come on in.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.100
Pour yourself some wine.

18:29.790 --> 18:31.140
These are pretty cool.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.010
Yeah,that's joshua tree.

18:33.020 --> 18:34.030
That would have been,

18:34.040 --> 18:36.490
uh,during my peyote period,which was,um.

18:37.130 --> 18:39.070
1979,according to this.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.190
Yeah.God,I'm old.

18:41.750 --> 18:42.550
drugs are bad.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.700
You know that,right?

18:43.710 --> 18:45.090
Yes,I do.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.340
Look at this-- you and my mom.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.810
That one's 1985.

18:52.820 --> 18:54.240
That was the last hurrah,huh?

18:54.250 --> 18:54.990
Oh,I guess.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.660
The '80s are pretty much a haze for me.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.380
Oh,my god,look.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.440
She looks beautiful.

19:02.450 --> 19:04.340
Yeah,well.

19:06.910 --> 19:08.830
I can't take credit for this one,though.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.170
What,you didn't take it?

19:10.180 --> 19:11.070
Oh,I took it.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.750
I just--you know,trained monkeys couldn't mess up a picture of her.

19:16.460 --> 19:17.530
You want it?

19:17.540 --> 19:18.580
- I can have it?
- Yeah.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.000
Thanks.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.420
I deleted all the bad ones.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.730
How many are left?

19:24.740 --> 19:25.480
2.

19:25.490 --> 19:26.870
What? I took over 100.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.900
Hey,come on.Two good pictures for one day of shooting?

19:28.910 --> 19:30.460
That's great.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.270
Oh,god,I'm just starving.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.250
Hey,you want to take a ride?

19:37.260 --> 19:39.300
I've got the driver taking me to the governor's mansion.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.840
I thought we could look at the lansing skyline.

19:42.070 --> 19:43.150
Maybe you could prep me.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.560
I know about isaac.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.330
And you still put him on your payroll?

19:48.250 --> 19:49.260
That was a long time ago.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.610
No,no,no.You brking my rock 'em sock 'em robots,

19:51.620 --> 19:53.550
okay,that was a long time ago.

19:53.790 --> 19:57.760
Me being outed in the local paper when I was barely 20,that's damn recent.

19:57.770 --> 19:59.620
This is something that we should talk about,

20:00.530 --> 20:01.180
but right now--

20:01.190 --> 20:02.750
it's inconvenient.Is that right?

20:02.760 --> 20:04.660
Unlike when you're campaigning in the bay area,

20:04.670 --> 20:07.250
when-- when having a gay brother is the thing you're most proud of.

20:07.260 --> 20:08.970
I have been complely consistent with you.

20:08.980 --> 20:11.710
I have never hidden or lied about your sexuality.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.850
I couldn't care less whether you're gay.

20:13.860 --> 20:16.020
Would it be easier for me if you weren't?

20:16.030 --> 20:17.030
Yeah.

20:17.410 --> 20:20.360
Yeah,I'm sorry I can't make it any easier for you.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.850
I have to go meet the governor.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.120
Great.Go.

20:28.130 --> 20:29.190
Two patrons,please.

20:29.200 --> 20:29.910
You got it.

20:29.920 --> 20:30.750
Are we're doing shots?

20:30.760 --> 20:32.550
We are having fun.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.190
To hell with joe.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.310
Paris,it's such a cliche anyway.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.360
What are you looking at?

20:37.370 --> 20:38.560
What?

20:38.570 --> 20:39.980
Hey,isn't that scotty?

20:39.990 --> 20:40.900
Where?

20:40.910 --> 20:42.510
It is scotty.Let's go say hi.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.160
No.No,he--he'll come to us.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.610
This is one of those "I'll prove them wrong" nights.

20:49.620 --> 20:50.190
I got it.Got you.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.510
I have no idea what you're talking about.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.980
I'm just here to have fun with my big sister.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.490
that's him over there.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.810
Uh-oh,we've been spotted.

20:55.820 --> 20:56.930
oh,my god.

20:56.940 --> 20:57.760
Quick,have fun.

21:01.580 --> 21:02.860
sarah,hi.

21:04.110 --> 21:05.340
I didn't expect to see you here.

21:05.350 --> 21:07.140
Yeah,we're just having fun.

21:07.150 --> 21:09.690
Sarah wanted a night out,and she loves karaoke,so--

21:09.700 --> 21:10.870
- fanaticaL.
- Perfect.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.110
Actually,kevin and I,we're gonna do.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.450
a big duet.

21:14.460 --> 21:15.090
Really?

21:15.100 --> 21:16.220
- No.
- Yup.

21:16.260 --> 21:17.610
Well,I'm glad that's settled.

21:17.620 --> 21:19.620
I-I would,but my-my-my throat's a little sore,so.

21:19.630 --> 21:21.040
- liar.
- Traitor.

21:21.050 --> 21:22.740
Well,you guys are welcome to come and join us.

21:22.750 --> 21:23.720
You know we will.

21:23.730 --> 21:24.830
later.

21:25.730 --> 21:26.930
Great,now he wants me to sing.

21:26.940 --> 21:28.070
Oh,you're singing,baby.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.720
Do you have any idea how stupid people look when they sing karaoke?

21:31.050 --> 21:32.580
two more patrons,please.

21:32.590 --> 21:34.600
God,you are so uptight!

21:34.850 --> 21:37.140
Do you want scotty's friends to know what a warm,

21:37.150 --> 21:40.480
caring,fun guy kevin walker is?

21:40.490 --> 21:41.590
Yes.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.670
Then drink up and get stupid with me.

21:46.030 --> 21:49.950
so when are we gonna meet the new mrs.Mccallister?

21:51.060 --> 21:53.040
Soon as you come to one of our events.

21:54.650 --> 21:56.270
This week has been hell.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.570
Tell me about it.

21:57.580 --> 21:58.760
Hey,look at you.

21:59.220 --> 22:01.800
You might win this thing.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.600
you know,your endorsement could really make that happen.

22:07.830 --> 22:10.640
Taylor has a reputation of holding a grudge.

22:10.650 --> 22:12.560
If he wins,it's my state.

22:12.570 --> 22:15.160
It's my political future on the line.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.820
Taylor has some serious momentum.

22:16.830 --> 22:18.210
Oh,come on.

22:19.410 --> 22:21.190
I campaigned for you.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.580
And I'm grateful.

22:22.590 --> 22:24.030
And look,this isn't personal.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.490
It is to me.

22:26.370 --> 22:30.180
You have my vote,but a public endorsement,I can'T.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.320
You should have told me sooner.

22:41.420 --> 22:42.290
how about dolly parton?

22:42.300 --> 22:43.360
You love her.

22:43.370 --> 22:44.030
No,I don'T.

22:44.040 --> 22:47.140
Remember in high school,you said she had the only pair of breasts you ever noticed.

22:47.150 --> 22:48.020
"9 to 5"!

22:48.030 --> 22:50.000
No,no,Scotty's friends think I'm obsessed with work.

22:50.010 --> 22:51.170
Something less corporate.

22:51.180 --> 22:52.450
Okay."Freebird."

22:52.460 --> 22:54.550
Yeah,what are we supposed to do for a 3-minute guitar solo,dance?

22:54.560 --> 22:57.250
I don't care.No,we get up,we express ourselves.

22:57.260 --> 22:58.110
Come on.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.670
This is our chance.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.200
- oh,no,no,no!
- What?

23:01.210 --> 23:02.590
I'm not ready.What are you doing?

23:02.600 --> 23:03.410
I'm singing!

23:03.420 --> 23:04.740
No,we're supposed to sing!

23:04.750 --> 23:06.640
We can't even decide on a song.

23:06.650 --> 23:07.390
I hate you!

23:07.400 --> 23:08.580
Oh,go get drunk.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.870
no do you believe in life after love?

24:18.880 --> 24:22.540
Okay,then make me believe,because I can't even bring myself to sign my divorce papers.

24:22.550 --> 24:24.670
What man in his right nd would divorce you?

24:24.680 --> 24:26.120
Okay,I love your friends.

24:26.130 --> 24:27.300
Oh,the feeling is definitely mutual.

24:27.310 --> 24:31.200
Okay,so my soon-to-be ex is about to vacay to paris--

24:31.210 --> 24:32.480
"vacay"?

24:32.490 --> 24:36.250
With his new girlfriend,who happens to be.

24:36.900 --> 24:37.750
his first wife.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.330
Shut.up.

24:39.340 --> 24:41.710
You need to sign those divorce papers and move on.

24:41.720 --> 24:42.980
Where are they now?

24:42.990 --> 24:44.930
They're,um,in the office.

24:44.940 --> 24:46.750
So get someone to bring 'em here.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.260
What,now? I can't do that.

24:48.270 --> 24:49.230
You see this?

24:49.240 --> 24:50.800
It's a little thing called a cell phone.

24:51.230 --> 24:54.170
Get those papers and sign them now.

24:54.180 --> 24:55.130
No,I can'T.

24:55.140 --> 24:56.400
Come on.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.470
do it.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.460
I'll do it.

25:08.460 --> 25:09.590
graham finch.

25:09.670 --> 25:12.030
Graham! It's sarah. what are you doing there?

25:12.110 --> 25:14.230
I can barely hear you. you at a concert or something?

25:14.390 --> 25:15.670
No, I'm in a bar.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.340
Are you drunk-dialing me?

25:17.480 --> 25:20.780
No. Listen, the thing is, i need my divorce papers.

25:20.970 --> 25:23.030
Could you have somebody bring them over to me?

25:23.140 --> 25:26.070
They're in the top, right-hand drawer of my desk.

25:26.170 --> 25:27.710
Yeah, well, uh, what's the rush?

25:27.840 --> 25:31.490
Graham, please, can you, just for once, do what I ask you, please?

25:31.600 --> 25:32.780
Okay, where are you?

25:32.870 --> 25:36.900
I broke up with my boyfriend a month ago, and I needed interim housing, so.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.890
I'm eeping in milo's spare room and drinking through his wine supply.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.480
How long have you known him?

25:42.580 --> 25:44.860
Not as long as you have, but, uh,

25:45.100 --> 25:48.170
a group of us his friends-- helped him through his divorce.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.900
His ex assumed we were the other women.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.700
- Well, she was wrong.
- yeah, the famous elaine.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.840
Well, we encouraged him to leave her, but, uh,

25:56.030 --> 25:59.390
he was horribly horribly faithful to her, right up until he moved out.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.770
Well, I guess he's making up for lost time now.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.620
- Is that jealousy I hear?
- no, i-i

26:03.730 --> 26:06.190
I didn't have that kind of relationship with milo.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.550
I know. he told me.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.560
I think you broke his heart a little bit.

26:14.220 --> 26:17.410
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortablE.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.280
ohh.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.170
This burger's dry.

26:24.470 --> 26:26.270
I thought you were a vegetarian.

26:26.370 --> 26:29.610
- Yeah, like a million years ago.
- Igotta go to the bathroom.

26:29.870 --> 26:31.690
Are you okay, jack?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.610
Jack?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.800
W-- are these your clothes?

26:36.460 --> 26:38.490
yes.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.590
Mom has a dress just like this.

26:41.020 --> 26:43.400
except it's bigger on top.

26:43.930 --> 26:44.700
Great.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.880
Maybe if you get pregnant, you'll get boobs.

26:47.010 --> 26:49.250
One can only hope.

26:49.810 --> 26:52.930
Oh, sophie, please come and rest.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.610
Ple--jack!

26:54.870 --> 26:56.320
What--why are you wet?

26:56.430 --> 27:00.410
Well, behind the toilet, there was this thing sticking out.

27:00.530 --> 27:02.950
- So I turned it just to see, and
- eww!

27:03.100 --> 27:05.960
Toilet water is everywhere! this is disgusting!

27:06.050 --> 27:08.900
Oh jack, Jack, wh-why did you do that?

27:09.020 --> 27:10.890
Mom says yelling's a sign of weakness.

27:11.110 --> 27:13.040
- I'm not yelling, sophie.
- I--I wish mom was here.

27:13.140 --> 27:15.230
You know what? you guys are starting to act like those mean,

27:15.310 --> 27:16.870
spoiled little kids in that fairy tale.

27:16.950 --> 27:20.460
- Remember the ones that fell into the boiling cauldron?
- well that makes you the evil stepmom.

27:20.560 --> 27:24.750
Well, right now i am the evil stepmom, and I want you to listen to me.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.280
There is gonna be no more whining, no more complaining,

27:27.420 --> 27:30.280
no more fighting over what we're gonna watch. now get in bed,

27:30.390 --> 27:32.810
and I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.190
Do you understand me?

27:36.600 --> 27:38.090
Hi, no.

27:38.470 --> 27:40.590
No, sorry.Sorry. no, everything is great.

27:40.670 --> 27:42.150
We're just--you know, we're having,

27:42.270 --> 27:44.360
um a plumbing problem.

27:49.650 --> 27:51.410
yeah.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.590
Oh, my god. is that...

27:55.780 --> 27:57.180
is that your messenger?

27:57.310 --> 27:58.960
He's not a messenger. he's a stuffed shirt

27:59.050 --> 28:00.950
He doesn't seem too button-down to me.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.100
excuse me.

28:04.210 --> 28:06.340
Graham, what are you doing here?

28:06.460 --> 28:08.570
Uh, well, I called a messenger, but he was,

28:08.760 --> 28:11.320
uh, he wasn't comfortae picking out a-- a woman in an unknown bar,

28:11.520 --> 28:14.090
but I can see that wouldn't have been that difficult.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.720
uh, graham finch, these ar my new best friends.

28:18.380 --> 28:20.190
Here you go.

28:21.130 --> 28:22.780
Hmm uh-oh.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.990
- do it, girl. be strong.
- Believe girl.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.860
I will be divorced in.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.300
three.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.590
two.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.770
one.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.210
Congratulations.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.900
Way to go.

28:41.780 --> 28:44.780
so.I'm a divorcee.

28:45.060 --> 28:46.960
Does that make me hotter?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.150
what's new, pussycat?

28:52.270 --> 28:56.580
whoa, whoa, whoa what's new, pussycat?

28:56.720 --> 29:00.550
whoa-oa-oa

29:02.130 --> 29:06.440
pussycat, pussycat I've got flowers and

29:06.580 --> 29:10.610
lots of hours to spend with you--

29:10.680 --> 29:15.540
maybe I didn't love you

29:17.300 --> 29:20.860
quite as often as i could have

29:21.340 --> 29:23.690
your brother's really something.

29:23.900 --> 29:26.940
Maybe I didn't treat you

29:27.030 --> 29:30.320
okay, he's not uptight when he is drunk.

29:30.460 --> 29:33.480
- quite as good...
- girls, I never thought I'd say this--

29:33.670 --> 29:35.840
i don't hate him.

29:36.580 --> 29:38.680
- where are you going?
- this is incredibly sweet,

29:38.800 --> 29:40.980
but I think I should probably put him out of his misery.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.880
Girl, I'm not mmm.

29:49.110 --> 29:51.040
They like you.

29:56.940 --> 29:59.030
I didn't get the endorsement.

29:59.950 --> 30:03.010
It's probably your cosmic payback.

30:03.140 --> 30:04.740
I don't want payback.

30:04.940 --> 30:07.050
Yeah, because you're good.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.940
and forgiving.

30:11.260 --> 30:13.660
I wish I was more ke you.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.910
I feel like we're both doing the same thing.

30:20.010 --> 30:22.380
You know, we're making compromises for a greater purpose.

30:22.590 --> 30:24.090
Is that what I'm doing?

30:24.580 --> 30:26.770
'Cause, boy, I don't know.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.520
It all just seems like a game.

30:29.630 --> 30:32.790
Attack this guy, stay away from that issue,

30:33.310 --> 30:36.280
and in the end, what do you really accomplish?

30:36.400 --> 30:40.470
Well, you didn't get into politics for money or--or power.

30:40.670 --> 30:42.780
A lot easier ways to get that, right?

30:43.730 --> 30:46.360
I think we were both called to serve.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.480
Thank you.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.880
Well, listen.

30:54.010 --> 30:56.550
it could all be over in 24 hours.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.710
- You want a drink?
- hell yes

31:06.490 --> 31:08.630
oh, good. you are up.

31:08.740 --> 31:12.770
Yeah, I have been looking through these beautiful photography books.

31:12.900 --> 31:15.060
- Where'd they come from?
- David.

31:15.410 --> 31:16.620
Beautiful, aren't they?

31:16.820 --> 31:18.370
Mom, he lent me so many things.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.200
He gave me a tripod and filters and--and a light meter.

31:21.490 --> 31:23.090
I mean, uh, he's great.

31:23.430 --> 31:25.760
I don't know how I fl about you seeing david,

31:25.950 --> 31:27.910
but I am thrilled you're so excited.

31:29.910 --> 31:32.400
You know, I might actually be half good.

31:33.510 --> 31:35.110
no, no, no, no.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.420
- I look terrible.
- what? mom?

31:36.510 --> 31:39.530
no, you don't, you look like you, which is beautiful.

31:39.650 --> 31:42.290
Could you just, like, fix some of the lights or something?

31:42.390 --> 31:48.150
He hasn't taught me that yet. but he did show me some old pictures of you.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.690
Oh, no. That must have been embarrassing.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.370
No, no, not at all.

31:53.310 --> 31:56.810
If the way he photographed you means anything,

31:57.260 --> 31:59.750
- he was seriously in love with you, mom.
- no.

31:59.870 --> 32:01.580
So, um,

32:01.710 --> 32:05.760
so you stopped seeing david right when you started dating william?

32:06.250 --> 32:08.900
Becca, i was seeing william,

32:09.010 --> 32:12.450
and then finally he let me know that he was never gonna leave nora.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.120
So I broke it off and I tried to move on.

32:14.310 --> 32:16.380
That's when I met david.

32:16.470 --> 32:17.470
We had fun.

32:17.590 --> 32:19.930
We made a few terrible movies gether.

32:20.010 --> 32:22.580
but it ended in 1985.

32:23.130 --> 32:26.430
I was ill in love with william.

32:26.550 --> 32:30.660
So even though he was married, that's who I wanted to be with.

32:31.260 --> 32:33.520
So william and david never overlapped?

32:33.710 --> 32:37.050
No, they did not.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.700
Oh, that's enough!

32:39.980 --> 32:42.740
Well, thank you. i mean, besides your head shots,

32:42.840 --> 32:44.560
I don't really think I have any pictures of you.

32:44.640 --> 32:47.670
Yeah, well, I want to see all of those.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.000
Sophie, what are you doing?

33:04.310 --> 33:07.600
I was just checking to see if you still had a fever.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.720
I'm okay. How are you feeling?

33:10.800 --> 33:12.920
My throat still hurts.

33:13.130 --> 33:16.050
You know, my mom gives me ice chips to chew on.

33:16.150 --> 33:17.620
Want me to get you some?

33:17.720 --> 33:20.480
Oh, that's really sweet, but I'm okay.

33:22.070 --> 33:24.470
You know, I'm, um.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.650
I'm really sorry I yelled.

33:26.770 --> 33:29.240
I guess I get cranky when I'm sick.

33:29.410 --> 33:31.210
Yeah, me, too.

33:31.680 --> 33:34.210
Does jack hate me?

33:34.450 --> 33:38.100
No.He thinks you're cool.

33:38.970 --> 33:41.680
how do you feel about getting some more sleep?

33:41.860 --> 33:43.380
That'd be good.

33:46.150 --> 33:50.980
I can't believe that you brought my divorce papers to a gay bar.

33:51.120 --> 33:53.900
Now don't you regret not going out with me sooner?

33:55.670 --> 33:57.600
- Can I ask you something?
-  yeah.

33:57.810 --> 34:01.170
Do you have women in every city, or just.

34:01.480 --> 34:02.780
california?

34:02.870 --> 34:05.120
Well, not ever city, no.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.790
You never got married?

34:09.500 --> 34:11.480
Came close a couple times.

34:11.650 --> 34:12.770
What stopped you?

34:12.960 --> 34:15.690
I don'know. too much to get into right now.

34:18.219 --> 34:21.570
a piece of paper to signify my regret.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.530
Well, you won't be on the market long.

34:24.810 --> 34:27.929
A woman like you? i give you...

34:28.219 --> 34:30.330
a year, tops.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.480
Maybe I like being on the market.

34:37.469 --> 34:38.750
- you know what?
- what?

34:39.230 --> 34:42.090
- No, I can'T.
- No, you

34:42.400 --> 34:46.449
- no, we shouldn't do it.
- You cannot play the perfect gentleman right now.

34:46.550 --> 34:49.900
you--you've been coming on to me since the day we met.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.480
Listen--but you're-- you're drunk.

34:51.600 --> 34:55.239
I know, but I'm a grown-up.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.750
and I know what I'm doing, despite the tequila.

34:58.960 --> 35:01.180
Well, when you put it that way.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.550
oh, god.

35:04.660 --> 35:06.670
- Let's get out of here.
- yeah.

35:24.830 --> 35:26.550
no oh, boy.

35:26.670 --> 35:29.140
Not even gonna say good-bye, are you?

35:29.350 --> 35:31.990
- Was I that bad?
- no.

35:32.200 --> 35:36.850
No, you were far from bad.

35:37.180 --> 35:39.610
I think.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.990
so why are you sneaking out?

35:42.090 --> 35:43.660
I'm not sneaking.

35:43.890 --> 35:45.670
I'm just, um.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.260
what? Why are you looking at me like that?

35:50.360 --> 35:54.250
Just... seeing you do the walk of shame.

35:54.590 --> 35:59.630
You... you know, I've been seeing a whole new side to you lately.

35:59.710 --> 36:01.120
No. no,

36:01.300 --> 36:03.000
here-- there's no shame.

36:03.210 --> 36:05.590
I am--I'm gonna strut out of here.

36:05.740 --> 36:08.130
And I'm gonna get in my car,

36:08.290 --> 36:13.590
and i'm going to drive home with pride.

36:13.730 --> 36:16.950
Yeah, well, uh, along with your pride,

36:17.090 --> 36:19.880
you might want to take this.

36:24.090 --> 36:27.220
I knew I should have worn the sexy one.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.360
bye.

36:37.130 --> 36:39.310
I wish you would have called first. i would have cleaned up.

36:39.420 --> 36:41.650
Oh, your place looks fine.

36:41.770 --> 36:43.890
No, I meant me.

36:44.130 --> 36:46.150
you look fine, too.

36:46.220 --> 36:48.050
I wanted to thank you for helping rebecca.

36:48.140 --> 36:50.310
- Heresit down.
- Thanks.

36:50.630 --> 36:52.080
And you don't have to thank me.

36:52.150 --> 36:56.630
Rebecca's a great girl-- a young woman-- eh, whatever.

36:56.870 --> 36:59.370
Yeah, and she's not a bad photographer, you know?

36:59.560 --> 37:01.910
- She's got potential.
- i know. she showed me.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.880
She's actually thinking about enrolling in some college courses.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.270
Oh, that's great.

37:07.370 --> 37:09.000
Did she tell you I showed her these?

37:09.210 --> 37:13.140
Oh, I can't believe you kept those.

37:13.670 --> 37:17.190
oh, Look at us.

37:17.990 --> 37:19.830
Yeah, we were so.

37:20.170 --> 37:21.850
cute?

37:22.460 --> 37:24.650
- wow
- And these.

37:24.930 --> 37:27.210
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.860
Those were the last pictures I ever took of you.

37:39.310 --> 37:42.220
okay, you're gonna have to leave now,

37:42.320 --> 37:44.510
or I'm pretty sure I'm gonna kiss you.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.450
okay

37:47.670 --> 37:51.220
okay--you're gonna leave, or okay, I should kiss you?

37:52.620 --> 37:55.520
I don't know.

38:04.210 --> 38:06.580
You're gonna leave now, aren't you?

39:04.850 --> 39:07.330
jack, you can't put two cards down.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.470
Yes, I can.

39:08.620 --> 39:10.830
D-don't look at me. i'm switizerland.

39:10.910 --> 39:14.030
Yeah, dad, he's allowed to put down two cards if they're the same value.

39:14.120 --> 39:16.560
Well, I'm--I'm just getting completely steamrolled here.

39:16.750 --> 39:19.570
You know, I think the precincts have probably reported by now.

39:19.670 --> 39:22.000
No, listen, if there's some news,  Travis will...

39:22.170 --> 39:24.480
come running in here and tell us, I'm sure.

39:25.110 --> 39:26.060
All right.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.310
All right, well, I suck at this game.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.290
- I know.
- you lost the last six times.

39:30.380 --> 39:32.930
Fives. And guess what? i only have two cards left.

39:33.030 --> 39:34.490
- We all know what that means.
- Uhh!

39:34.620 --> 39:36.260
you forgot to say uno!

39:36.350 --> 39:38.720
You didn't give me a chance to say "uno." Uno! Uno!

39:38.860 --> 39:41.160
All three networks just called it.

39:41.570 --> 39:44.830
- We took michigan!
- Yes! Yes!

39:45.120 --> 39:48.390

39:50.670 --> 39:52.340
- oh, yeah! This rocks.
- This is so cool.

39:52.510 --> 39:54.520
yes, daddy!

39:54.710 --> 39:57.110
Way to go, daddy!

39:57.200 --> 39:58.810
