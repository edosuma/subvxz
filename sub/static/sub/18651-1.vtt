500 of them stark-naked,
screamin' their heads off, all with spears.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.792
Yes, they weren't very nice, those spears.

02:07.875 --> 02:09.509
Well, they say it's much worse now,

02:09.583 --> 02:13.092
but these young fellas nowadays,
they haven't got the stomach for it.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.549
There's not many has when
it comes to a spear.

02:15.625 --> 02:19.880
Talk sense, man. All I say is, if
there is a war, which God forbid,

02:19.958 --> 02:23.668
then you can say goodbye to England,
home and beauty,

02:23.750 --> 02:27.258
because the young chaps
now, they can't fight.

02:27.333 --> 02:28.543
Hello, Drummer.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.177
Well, what about us?

02:30.250 --> 02:33.011
What about
the Duke of Glendon's Light Infantry, eh?

02:33.083 --> 02:35.051
What about the Dogs?

02:35.125 --> 02:38.088
But you said yourself
the Dogs aren't what they were.

02:38.167 --> 02:43.002
It's all this education and machinery
and goin' to the pictures.

02:43.083 --> 02:48.002
It's all right to have a good regiment
but where are the men to fight in it?

02:48.083 --> 02:50.418
That's the point.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.135
Where are they?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.252
There you are. That ought
to warm 'em up a bit.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.885
International crisis.

03:14.958 --> 03:17.376
I tell you, Fred, things
are getting serious.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.883
Do you know what time I got
home last night? Half past ten.

03:20.958 --> 03:24.668
- Winston's having another go at them upstairs.
- Oh, well, that's something.

03:24.750 --> 03:27.926
You know that fellow Westlake,
National Liberal, Bromwich East?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.085
Do you know how long he went on last night?

03:30.167 --> 03:32.170
Hour and 40 minutes solid.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.969
I know. I know. You're dead right.

03:34.042 --> 03:35.713
It's the third time this week.

03:35.792 --> 03:38.293
I tell you, Fred,
my missus is getting proper fed up.

03:38.375 --> 03:41.551
We're going to have a war.
Right. Let 'em start one now.

03:41.625 --> 03:46.046
Let 'em get on with it. Let us get home
early to our suppers for once in a change.

03:46.125 --> 03:50.593
War? Not a chance of it, madam, not this year.
It's not in anybody's interests, is it, really?

03:50.667 --> 03:53.511
- Passage for California?
- Yes. The end counter over there.

03:53.583 --> 03:56.215
Payable to the Agency, sir.
Just "& Co". No "Limited"

03:56.292 --> 03:58.757
You'll arrive in Benghazi on the 20th...

03:58.833 --> 04:01.465
- Are we likely to run into any sandstorms?
- No, madam.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.469
The Italians haven't been very clever
about their publicity.

04:04.542 --> 04:08.251
Libya's the only unspoiled playground
in the Mediterranean.

04:08.333 --> 04:11.048
War, that's the trouble.
It may start at any moment.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.708
We'd like to do lots of repairs,
but our hands are tied.

04:13.792 --> 04:16.719
- Not when it comes to taking the rent!
- If times were normal,

04:16.791 --> 04:19.837
we'd be giving you a bath with a geyser
and new paint.

04:19.916 --> 04:22.465
I don't want a geyser.
I want the guttering put right.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.343
Drip, drip, drip! It drives you mad.

04:24.417 --> 04:27.877
We can't all be thinking of ourselves
in times like these, Mrs Williams.

04:27.958 --> 04:30.720
And with summer coming on,
it won't bother you so much.

04:32.333 --> 04:35.178
I've only had it six months,
now they're talking about a war.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.170
I won't be able to get any spares. Foreign.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.881
- You may not be able to get any petrol.
- Don't talk silly.

04:39.958 --> 04:41.629
How am I going to get home?

04:41.708 --> 04:44.920
- It's nearly quarter past, Jim.
- Won't be a moment.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.799
You're in a bit of a hurry, aren't you?

04:48.875 --> 04:51.885
- Oh, that again.
- I've got to be at the Drill Hall by half past.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.755
Territorials! Look here, Jimmy boy,
I was in the last lot.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.883
At the War Office.
Nearly ruined my health.

04:56.958 --> 04:59.885
Don't start looking for trouble.
If there is going to be a war,

04:59.958 --> 05:03.834
and if they hadn't told us to keep cool after
Munich, I wouldn't have put new pumps up,

05:03.917 --> 05:07.425
but if there is going to be a war,
the whole place goes over to munitions.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.752
With that knack of yours
and my good management,

05:09.833 --> 05:12.002
why, there'll be a packet
in it for all of us.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.382
Enough for you to buy
that place of your own.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.924
And it's patriotic, too. Hello, Mrs Perry.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.968
Hello, Mr Jackson. Coming, Jim?

05:19.042 --> 05:22.088
- I can't go with my buttons like this.
- Buttons! Listen to him.

05:22.167 --> 05:24.928
A man with your husband's brains
playing at soldiers.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.129
It isn't as if he's got any rifles
or machine guns or any real things.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.923
- But they have, haven't you?
- Of course we have. Hurry up.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.674
The trouble is to get them all clean.
They've got so many new guns and tanks.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.677
- Tanks? I thought he was in the infantry.
- Little tanks.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.172
You know, carriers.

05:39.250 --> 05:42.095
Well, the papers say you haven't
got a thing. Not a thing!

05:42.167 --> 05:44.335
You don't want to believe
everything you read.

05:44.417 --> 05:47.214
I wish I could take you to the Drill Hall.
You'd be amazed.

05:47.292 --> 05:49.377
So much stuff there,
we've nowhere to put it.

05:49.458 --> 05:51.296
It'd be a great eye-opener.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.592
Now, this is the 1914 type.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.504
When we get a gun - and
we may any day now -

05:55.583 --> 05:58.261
we shall probably get the 1917 type
with improvements.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.336
I used it myself in 1918.

06:00.417 --> 06:02.882
The main thing is, keep it clean.

06:02.958 --> 06:06.218
Mind you don't drop the magazines,
and remember the eight stoppages.

06:06.292 --> 06:08.674
Get mud in the feed pawls
and you'll have trouble.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.132
- A bent magazine, you got more trouble.
- Hey!

06:11.208 --> 06:14.005
Shan't be a minute, old man.
But it's a good old gun.

06:14.083 --> 06:17.213
In my humble opinion,
the perfect answer to attacks from the air.

06:17.292 --> 06:19.709
So if hostile aeroplanes
try to interfere with you,

06:19.792 --> 06:22.719
all you got to do is touch 'em up a bit
with the old Lewis. Got it?

06:28.000 --> 06:32.835
We ought to have dug trenches at Dunkirk,
let the Germans through,

06:32.917 --> 06:36.377
- then taken them in the rear.
- What can you do with a rifle against a tank?

06:36.458 --> 06:42.219
Oh, we had our troubles, in the Sudan and in
Basutoland, but we got through all right.

06:42.292 --> 06:44.674
- The Dogs always do.
- Ah...

06:44.750 --> 06:46.172
What was you in?

06:46.250 --> 06:49.794
The Dogs. D-O-Gs.
Duke of Glendon's Light Infantry.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.795
You ought to know that, young fellow.

06:51.875 --> 06:54.044
- What you in?
- Parachutes.

06:54.125 --> 06:55.760
Oh, the Umbrella Danglers.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.299
Who does your marching for you?

06:58.375 --> 07:00.259
They could have done with us in Greece.

07:00.333 --> 07:03.924
There's another bungled engagement for you.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.885
Surrounded? All right, form square, same
as what old General McNeill did at Suakin.

07:10.958 --> 07:14.668
- You'd be too old to remember that?
- Mm.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.090
Times have changed, Dad.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.672
He's right, Bobby.

07:17.750 --> 07:22.918
I don't doubt they use bayonets nowadays,
the like of which we've never seen.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.552
Great long beggars.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.426
No, nothing's changed.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.925
Except that life's much
easier than it used to be.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.709
Now all them battle courses.
Lot of nonsense!

07:34.750 --> 07:38.886
Anything to get out of marching.
Cushy, compared to what we had to do.

07:38.958 --> 07:43.628
Up to our knees in water to cross a stream.
No time to take your boots off.

07:43.708 --> 07:46.043
No joke, it was.

07:46.125 --> 07:51.293
Nowadays, they're afraid of getting their feet
wet Might get in a draught and catch cold.

07:51.375 --> 07:52.927
Lot of nonsense.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.049
One sergeant we had used to shout and scream,
just to make it sound like a real battle.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.626
Wouldn't like that sort of caper nowadays.

08:00.708 --> 08:05.259
Too worried about them fancy battle suits
of theirs, these young fellas.

08:05.333 --> 08:08.011
Keeping a crease in their trousers
to go out with a girl.

08:08.083 --> 08:13.216
No buttons to clean like we had.
They don't know what polishing is.

08:13.292 --> 08:19.668
And another thing, we didn't get broke off for a
cup of tea every five minutes like they do now.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.302
We had to keep on marching,

08:21.375 --> 08:25.796
dressing properly by the right
with bayonets gleaming and everything.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.676
Looked lovely it did.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.255
Didn't feel so lovely, though.

08:29.333 --> 08:32.379
No joke when you've got wet feet
and the sergeant's watching you,

08:32.457 --> 08:34.461
specially when it's hot.

08:34.542 --> 08:37.422
Didn't have no feelings,
those old sergeants.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.008
No taking it easy with them -
"left right, left right" -

08:41.082 --> 08:43.299
had to watch your step, you did.

08:43.375 --> 08:49.088
If you made a mistake in the drill,
you all had to go back and do it again.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.553
Much easier.

08:50.625 --> 08:54.631
I don't know why they don't call
some of us up, some of the old Dogs.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.877
We'd show 'em.

08:56.958 --> 08:59.424
No need to, Dad. Look.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.843
- Big new call-up.
- Fat lot of good that'll do.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.595
Duke of Glendon's Light Infantry.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.089
I know it's wrong.

09:07.167 --> 09:11.255
Mr Davenport said so himself. He said
definitely they were going to get me deferred.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.969
I was on the list. He said so himself.

09:13.042 --> 09:17.130
Eat your egg.
I think you rely too much on Mr Davenport.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.425
Oh, you don't know him. He'll do something.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.261
That's one thing about the firm,
they never let you down.

09:22.333 --> 09:26.386
I'm sorry, Parsons, but it's been agreed
that Mr Thyrtle in the bargain basement

09:26.458 --> 09:30.511
will deal with all deferments in future,
so if you'd care to go and see him...

09:30.583 --> 09:33.712
But you must realise, you know,
there's a war on.

09:33.792 --> 09:35.510
Only key men are deferred now.

09:35.583 --> 09:40.300
I understand, but is there a chance that Mr
Thyrtle might do something? You see, my wife...

09:40.375 --> 09:44.132
We've lost Collins from Refrigerators
and Barker from Winter Sports this week.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.342
There was nothing Mr Thyrtle could do.

09:46.417 --> 09:48.301
- I see, sir.
- I'm sorry, Parsons.

09:56.292 --> 09:59.006
Mr Thyrtle, please. Quickly.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.834
No, thank you.

10:05.917 --> 10:09.342
By the way, Parsons,
I think it might be less um...

10:09.417 --> 10:13.505
shall I say, embarrassing
for both of us if we...

10:13.583 --> 10:21.500
forget... disregard any differences in status
which may have existed at the... at the store.

10:21.583 --> 10:22.840
Yes, sir. Thank you.

10:22.917 --> 10:26.544
I must say, I think it very -
to put it mildly - thoughtless

10:26.625 --> 10:30.216
of the powers that be
to allow such a situation to arise.

10:30.292 --> 10:31.844
Oh, I do agree, sir.

10:31.917 --> 10:36.219
After all, it's not as if my activities were
confined to toys. I was in charge of officers' kit.

10:36.292 --> 10:40.131
- Yes, and garden ornaments.
- I know, but it's the officers' kit which makes...

10:40.208 --> 10:42.009
Well, never matter.

10:43.083 --> 10:46.793
- I must say, I think the Ministry are ill-advised.
- About your case, sir?

10:46.875 --> 10:49.293
In general, Parsons. In general.

10:50.375 --> 10:52.425
- This free?
- I believe so.

10:54.583 --> 10:58.341
Confidentially, I took the opportunity
of suggesting to the Managing Director

10:58.417 --> 11:02.340
when I was saying au revoir, that Mr
Thyrtle is no longer pulling his weight.

11:02.417 --> 11:04.633
That should do a lot of good, sir.

11:04.708 --> 11:08.927
At any rate, I have taken the matter out of
the firm's hands and written direct to my MP.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.583
- Who's he?
- I beg your pardon.

11:11.667 --> 11:14.381
- Who's he, your MP?
- Sir Henry Chalmers Thompson.

11:14.458 --> 11:18.417
Oh, old Liverlips. Talked for two hours and
a half on the Brompton sewage scheme bill.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.384
Couldn't hear hisself for snores.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.876
- Do you know Sir Henry?
- I'm in the 'Ouse.

11:23.958 --> 11:26.044
- A member?
- No, I work there on the boilers.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.926
They'll be sorry they let me go.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.757
You wait till the winter. They'll be
asking questions in the 'Ouse, all right.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.587
"Who let Ted Brewer go off to the Army?"

11:33.667 --> 11:36.345
No-one can work them dampers like I can.
They'll freeze.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.502
Are you called up? So are we.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.878
All the same, I don't think you should
refer to Sir Henry in that way.

11:41.958 --> 11:45.004
No? Listen, there's only one good man
ever got into Parliament.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.466
- Who would that be?
- Bleedin' Guy Fawkes.

11:48.667 --> 11:52.257
- I wonder what time we get to Hacklesfield.
- I've no idea.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.218
Three eleven.

11:54.292 --> 11:56.377
- Change at Crewe, don't we?
- Can do. Can do.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.876
Or there's the Derby way.
That's more comfortable.

11:58.958 --> 12:02.253
- Doesn't get you in till five seven.
- We've got to be there by four.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.134
- What, you called up, too?
- Yes.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.756
What, all of you? Go on!

12:06.833 --> 12:10.258
- It's all adventure, isn't it?
- Depends on your previous occupation.

12:10.333 --> 12:13.545
Oh, I was very well situated. Big
travel people. Butlers. Know them?

12:13.625 --> 12:15.509
I suppose you know all the trains, then?

12:15.583 --> 12:17.669
I don't think you'd catch me out in Europe.

12:17.750 --> 12:21.756
Prewar, that is. I'm a bit continental
myself. Swiss grandmother.

12:21.833 --> 12:25.756
- Your job's over for the duration.
- I don't know. People have still got to travel.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.714
Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag,
I always say.

12:28.792 --> 12:31.008
By the way, any of you in the Scouts?

12:33.375 --> 12:35.627
Hurry up. The two-twenty'll
be here in a minute.

12:35.708 --> 12:38.423
All right, I've only got one pair of hands,
haven't I? Yes?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.882
If you're not too busy,
we'd like the same again.

12:41.958 --> 12:45.253
I've had a wonderful life.
I can't grumble. It's all been like that.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.839
- You got a car?
- Yes.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.552
- What make?
- It's a Jowett.

12:48.625 --> 12:51.340
There's a smashing little job.
I've got a Lagonda.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.918
I'll race you,
soon as we get out of this ruddy army.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.761
- Can't last much longer, can it?
- What, the war? I hope not.

12:56.833 --> 13:00.756
- Too much rent control.
- And then I'll buy a new car.

13:00.833 --> 13:03.760
I'll buy a Mercedes. Rooaaar! Smashing.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.381
- Wonder how many more there'll be of us.
- I don't know.

13:06.458 --> 13:10.465
I suppose some will come from London,
poor mutts. What do you think of it all?

13:10.542 --> 13:12.545
- Very little.
- Yes, I think you're right.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.509
I was in two minds about coming at all.

13:14.583 --> 13:18.590
- Here's the two-twenty. Hurry, Maisie!
- All right, all right, don't get all het up.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.511
- Well, anyway, cheers.
- Cheers.

13:21.583 --> 13:26.798
This is Crewe. Crewe Station.
Crewe.

13:26.875 --> 13:34.674
Passengers for Liverpool, Shrewsbury, Chester
and Hacklesfield should change here.

13:35.875 --> 13:38.720
- Have we time for a cup of tea?
- What about it, Mr Beck?

13:38.792 --> 13:41.968
Platform 7. We've got five minutes.
Time for a quick cup.

13:42.042 --> 13:45.502
- Shall I run and get you a cup, Mr Davenport?
- No, no. We'll all go.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.261
Can you tell me,
where does the Hacklesfield train start?

13:52.333 --> 13:55.130
- Platform 7. Over the bridge.
- Are you going there too?

13:55.208 --> 13:58.302
I'll say. Duke of Glendon's Light
footsloggers. Have a cup of tea.

13:59.167 --> 14:02.260
I'm a fellow with a very independent disposition.

14:02.333 --> 14:05.011
Can't stand people telling me what to do.

14:05.083 --> 14:07.252
And if they try it, then I
always want to be rude.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.668
In fact, I usually am.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.339
Here, I'll get 'em.

14:11.417 --> 14:14.261
The Army will have to put up with me
and not me with the Army.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.751
- Stop shoving, mate, will you?
- I'm sorry, old man.

14:16.833 --> 14:17.675
Tea?

14:17.750 --> 14:20.961
- China for me.
- Get used to char. It's all they got in the Army.

14:21.042 --> 14:23.258
Oh, good old Army. The thin red line.
Smashing!

14:23.333 --> 14:26.711
- I don't blame you for getting bottled.
- You going to Hacklesfield?

14:26.792 --> 14:29.293
- Yes. You too?
- Yes.

14:29.375 --> 14:33.298
My name's Stainer. Can I interest any of
you in buying a Rolls-Royce or a Bentley?

14:33.375 --> 14:36.006
- Three teas and a bitter.
- Four teas.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.635
All set for the last lap?

14:37.708 --> 14:40.671
- Looking forward to it, this bloke.
- You can't look back on it.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.753
No. I wonder when we'll be able to.

14:42.833 --> 14:46.626
Mr Davenport was doing very important work
at the time of his call-up.

14:46.708 --> 14:50.927
The Army's full of people who make you suffer
because you're no good at polishing buttons.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.544
It might have gone down with the last
generation and even with some of you,

14:54.625 --> 14:57.340
but it won't go down with me,
because I'm independent.

14:57.417 --> 15:01.044
- And if they don't like it, I'll walk right out.
- Look out what you're doing.

15:02.125 --> 15:06.214
Don't you shout at me like that.
I'm not in the Army yet, you know.

15:07.417 --> 15:09.918
- He didn't do it on purpose.
- That's right.

15:14.792 --> 15:18.466
- There's a nasty piece of work for you.
- That's the way to treat them, see.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.635
Scared stiff, he was. They always
are if you stand up for yourself.

15:21.708 --> 15:23.095
He looked like a regular.

15:23.167 --> 15:26.129
Fancy putting decent civilians
under blokes like that.

15:26.208 --> 15:28.258
Hurry up with that bitter, miss.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.632
You can't eat by numbers
and sleep by numbers.

15:30.708 --> 15:32.877
Have them yelling at
you, day in and day out.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.843
By the left. Quick! Eat!

15:34.917 --> 15:37.334
Shut up, shut up.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.341
Oh, dear.

15:51.833 --> 15:55.128
There you are, you see.
He's ashamed of himself.

15:55.208 --> 15:58.882
- Hurry up with that bitter, miss.
- We haven't time for tea now.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.428
Have a bite?

16:00.500 --> 16:03.083
No, thank you.
I'm rather worried about my digestion.

16:03.167 --> 16:07.006
- I have a very sensitive stomach.
- Always did have, didn't you, Mr Davenport?

16:07.083 --> 16:08.837
- Where are you going?
- To get a seat.

16:08.917 --> 16:12.295
- Good idea.
- We were here before some of these people.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.259
Appalling service.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.419
Last journey without a pass for years.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.421
Ten Gold Flake, please.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.005
Ten Gold Flake!

16:27.083 --> 16:33.459
Passengers for Hacklesfield,
your train is leaving from Platform 7.

16:33.542 --> 16:37.334
Left right, left right, left right,
left right, left right left!

16:46.875 --> 16:49.553
All right, jump down, lads.
I'll be back in a minute.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.755
Doesn't seem such a bad bloke.

16:54.833 --> 16:57.168
They've got to be nice
when you're in civvies.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.921
Look at this.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.343
Breathe natural, that's the idea.

17:02.417 --> 17:04.669
- Barbarian.
- Hey, look.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.132
Keep those knees up.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.590
Nice big strides. Feel the benefit.

17:09.666 --> 17:11.172
Come on! Pick 'em up.

17:11.250 --> 17:14.840
Are you the new intake? That's right.
Nice tall fella should do well at PT.

17:14.916 --> 17:17.963
Stand up, now. Let's see a smile.
Make the best of yourself.

17:18.041 --> 17:20.839
Come on, stand up, son.
And look me straight in the eyes.

17:20.916 --> 17:23.714
That's right. You look a bit weedy
at the moment. So do you.

17:23.791 --> 17:26.174
Too much town life. We'll
soon build you up.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.668
Smile, nice smile. That's right.

17:28.750 --> 17:33.135
Come on, what's the matter with you, lad? Get
a haircut first thing, make you feel better.

17:33.208 --> 17:34.548
And that's an order.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.043
Go on, you've only been four miles.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.677
Ought to feel fresh as a daisy!

17:38.750 --> 17:41.333
Look out, my lucky lads.
I'm coming after you!

17:44.917 --> 17:47.465
Right! Pay attention!

17:47.542 --> 17:52.211
Then after I got back from Dunkirk I was sent to
the training battalion as a Sergeant Instructor,

17:52.292 --> 17:55.919
- then to the Officers Training Unit.
- Our job is to get up to strength again.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.757
We'd hoped for trained men, but we've got
civilians whether we like it or not.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.216
Some came in last week.
30 more expected today.

18:02.292 --> 18:06.428
You'll be looking after them. I expect
you'll get pretty fed up with them at first.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.633
They won't seem as... keen as you are.

18:08.708 --> 18:13.876
Then one day, you'll find you've got a platoon
of some of the finest infantry in the world.

18:13.958 --> 18:16.673
I don't know how it happens, but it does.
Oh, Edwards.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.049
- Sir?
- This is Perry.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.459
- Hello. Very glad to have you.
- Thank you, sir.

18:21.542 --> 18:24.090
You're lucky.
You might have gone to another company.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.252
Perry was in France with
the 12th Battalion.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.922
- NCO?
- Sergeant, sir.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.299
Oh, has the depot sent
you your sergeant yet?

18:30.375 --> 18:33.800
Due this afternoon, sir. Fletcher.
Regular with seven years' service.

18:33.875 --> 18:36.720
- Let me know what you think of him.
- Right, sir.

18:36.792 --> 18:39.589
Right, Perry. I'll leave Captain
Edwards to look after you.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.302
Sir.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.005
- I'm giving him No.9 platoon, sir.
- Fine.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.968
I can feel my rheumatics coming back again.

18:48.042 --> 18:51.087
You'll have to get rid of those
before we start on these courses.

18:51.167 --> 18:54.177
Jumping ditches of broken glass
with bullets whistling by.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.885
- How do you know?
- Picture Post.

18:55.958 --> 18:57.547
I can't understand it.

18:57.625 --> 19:01.050
The Government puts broken glass
on top of walls to protect its property,

19:01.125 --> 19:03.922
then trains blokes to get across it
at its own expense.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.298
At our expense, man. We're just cogs in a
great machine. We pay for our own discomfort.

19:09.375 --> 19:12.136
These living conditions
are most insanitary.

19:12.208 --> 19:14.792
Not if we keep the doors and windows open.

19:14.875 --> 19:17.921
- I can't sleep with the windows open.
- How is your stomach?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.003
- Acute.
- Mm. That'll be the worry.

19:20.083 --> 19:23.674
That's your bowels. Driving my tractor
for a week would put it right for ye.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.595
- What, are you a farmer, then?
- I wouldn't be here if I was.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.136
I worked on a farm, though.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.879
They have a lassie doing my job now.

19:29.958 --> 19:34.177
She's better-looking than me
but not for that kind of work.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.419
What else did it say in Picture Post?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.503
Oh, yes. When you come to the barbed wire,

19:38.583 --> 19:41.546
one fellow lays across it
and all the others run over his back.

19:41.625 --> 19:44.091
- Oh, shut up, can't you?
- I'm only telling them.

19:44.167 --> 19:48.801
Battle training they call it. Just to get you
used to things. Real live bullets they use, too.

19:48.875 --> 19:52.253
Well, I won't be shot at merely to gratify
some oafish, military whim.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.509
Then there are these bayonet charges.
Three miles long, uphill.

19:55.583 --> 19:57.503
They make you run all the way, too.

19:57.583 --> 20:01.423
And then you go swinging from tree to tree
on ropes. You know, Tarzan-fashion.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.585
- Should be interesting.
- Oh, turn it up!

20:03.667 --> 20:05.883
You don't know what you're
talking about, Beck.

20:05.958 --> 20:08.506
What have you got to smile about, Lloyd?

20:08.583 --> 20:10.219
Oh, nothing.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.377
What a tragedy it all is.

20:12.458 --> 20:16.630
I'll get my lumbago back again at this rate. I
didn't ought to be in the Army. Not really.

20:16.708 --> 20:19.007
Any day now. Ha!

20:19.083 --> 20:20.553
Lumbago.

20:21.833 --> 20:24.050
Don't they give us sheets
as well as blankets?

20:24.125 --> 20:26.507
Not in the Army. They do in the RAF.

20:26.583 --> 20:30.257
I'd never have believed that in a civilised
country, doctors would permit...

20:30.333 --> 20:32.585
All right, stop talking.
Now, pay attention.

20:35.792 --> 20:38.126
Now, you're going to be No.9 Platoon.

20:38.208 --> 20:40.756
Mr Perry will be your officer
and I'm your sergeant.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.339
Fletcher's my name.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.502
Sergeant Fletcher. Got it?

20:45.583 --> 20:50.087
Now, I'm used to having the best platoon in
the battalion and I'm going to have it again.

20:50.167 --> 20:54.255
This is the programme. You can take it easy
tonight but no leaving the camp.

20:54.333 --> 20:58.126
There'll be hot supper served for you
at seven. The canteen's open till nine.

20:58.208 --> 21:01.966
Lights out at ten. Corporal Robbins
will tell you about the blackout.

21:02.042 --> 21:06.711
Tomorrow you'll be issued with your kit and get
inoculated. On Monday we start work proper.

21:06.792 --> 21:08.427
Got it?

21:08.500 --> 21:10.420
Right. Let's have your names.

21:11.542 --> 21:13.959
- Davenport.
- Right. Yes?

21:14.042 --> 21:15.879
Parsons, sir.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.925
- Your name?
- Beck, Sergeant.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.050
- And yours?
- Lloyd.

21:26.542 --> 21:27.881
You?

21:28.792 --> 21:29.918
Stainer.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.793
Yes?

21:34.875 --> 21:36.261
Luke.

21:36.333 --> 21:37.720
Yes?

21:37.792 --> 21:38.882
Brewer.

21:38.958 --> 21:40.380
Yes?

21:40.458 --> 21:42.508
Truscott.

21:43.917 --> 21:47.840
Squad will advance! About... turn!

21:49.000 --> 21:51.631
Leave it, leave it. I'll tell
you when to pick it up.

21:51.708 --> 21:54.635
Squad, stand at ease!

21:54.708 --> 21:57.043
That man in the front rank there. Stainer.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.424
Corporal, put him in the
correct ease position.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.676
Feet 12 inches apart, stomach in,
arms straight. Brace yourself.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.421
All right, Corporal.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.834
Squad, 'shun.

22:06.917 --> 22:10.674
As you were! Wake up!
What's your name? Daventry?

22:10.750 --> 22:13.333
- Davenport.
- You're too slow, five minutes behind.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.965
Think what you're doing. And you, too.

22:16.042 --> 22:19.467
And you, Lloyd, wait for the
word of command before you move.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.675
- Look to your front!
- Officer coming.

22:21.750 --> 22:24.002
All right, Corporal. Fall in. Pick it up.

22:24.083 --> 22:25.884
Squad, 'shun.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.752
- Stand at ease, please.
- Sir.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.836
Squad, stand at ease.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.842
- What's your name?
- Truscott, sir.

22:40.917 --> 22:42.635
Stand to attention.

22:42.708 --> 22:45.553
- Take these names for the tailor.
- Sir. Look to your front.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.836
Do you think you're going to
enjoy the Army, Truscott?

22:48.917 --> 22:50.836
Well, I put down for the Navy, sir.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.635
- Your name?
- Lloyd, sir.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.509
Go on. Stand at ease.

22:56.583 --> 22:59.215
This is far too big.
Keep those trousers well hitched up.

22:59.292 --> 23:00.880
Yes, sir.

23:02.708 --> 23:05.174
- What's your name?
- Herbert Davenport, sir.

23:05.250 --> 23:09.386
- What's the trouble with the boots?
- They're a little tight in the toe, sir.

23:09.458 --> 23:13.049
- I've rather a high instep.
- What was your job before you came here?

23:13.125 --> 23:15.093
Rather an important one, actually, sir.

23:15.167 --> 23:19.385
I was in charge of three departments
at Burbages, including officers' kit.

23:20.292 --> 23:21.761
Too big, Sergeant Fletcher.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.548
And the trousers are a
little loose in the seat.

23:24.625 --> 23:26.675
- Your name?
- Parsons, sir.

23:29.167 --> 23:32.841
Filth! What do you think a barrack
inspection is? A joke? Lay it out proper.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.592
You've got another five tons to shift yet.

23:36.667 --> 23:40.045
Come on! You'll do it properly
if I have to keep you here all night.

23:40.125 --> 23:45.091
Six men to scrub out the cookhouse.
You, you, you, you, you. And you.

23:45.167 --> 23:47.928
Eyes right!

23:48.000 --> 23:49.589
Wake up, that man!

23:49.667 --> 23:51.421
No, you can't have 48 hours.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.178
You've only been in a month.
This isn't a holiday camp.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.343
Stand up! Pick up that step!

23:59.208 --> 24:01.425
You six are detailed for
guard tonight. Got it?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.418
This is a life, isn't it, eh?

24:04.500 --> 24:08.672
A child of three doesn't take as much pleasure
in making a noise as Sergeant Fletcher.

24:08.750 --> 24:13.799
It's just like I said. Putting us under guys like
that, it's criminal. Two guards in one week.

24:13.875 --> 24:16.720
- No, 13 days it is.
- Oh, shut up.

24:16.792 --> 24:20.217
Who was it made him turn nasty
in the first place, spilling his tea?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.875
- He'll soon change his tune.
- Who's going to make him?

24:22.958 --> 24:24.878
- I am.
- When?

24:24.958 --> 24:29.260
- Soon as I know my way around a bit.
- When'll that be? Ten years' time?

24:29.333 --> 24:33.505
We've only done six weeks so far.
Will you look at that spud!

24:33.583 --> 24:36.878
- Throw it away.
- Here, don't throw a perfectly good spud away.

24:36.958 --> 24:38.677
You're a nuisance, you are.

24:38.750 --> 24:41.428
I don't see how Fletcher
could have remembered us all.

24:41.500 --> 24:47.343
- I had my back to him.
- It's just like I said in the first place. The Army!

24:47.417 --> 24:51.007
- Hey, that man!
- Hello, what's that?

24:51.083 --> 24:52.470
That man!

24:52.542 --> 24:55.884
Take those hands out of your pockets.
Yes, you!

24:55.958 --> 24:57.961
There's no parade. Hark at him shouting.

24:58.042 --> 24:59.298
Cad.

24:59.375 --> 25:01.757
You'd think he'd know those
letters off by heart.

25:05.042 --> 25:06.796
I don't seem to get any letters.

25:06.875 --> 25:09.590
Come on. You're not getting out of it.
We're saving yours.

25:10.625 --> 25:13.043
I'm going to shoot that rat
the day we get live ammo.

25:13.125 --> 25:14.547
What was all the shouting?

25:14.625 --> 25:17.801
I'm walking back from the lats, quietly,
committing no offence.

25:17.875 --> 25:21.715
All at once I feels my nose running, so my
hand goes to my pocket to get the hankie out.

25:21.792 --> 25:25.715
Next thing I hear is his voice yelling at
me across the square from the other NAAFI.

25:25.792 --> 25:28.754
"Take your hands out of
your pocket, that man."

25:28.833 --> 25:30.718
"That man!"

25:30.792 --> 25:32.629
You wouldn't think we was human beings.

25:32.708 --> 25:34.509
You can't blow your nose now!

25:34.583 --> 25:37.049
- There. I warned you, didn't I?
- You did, Geoffrey.

25:37.125 --> 25:41.178
It would have been the same if we hadn't spilled
his tea. I wish I'd thrown it in his face.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.632
- Golly!
- I'd love to have done it. It was boiling.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.635
You keep on saying that.
I'd like to see you do it.

25:46.708 --> 25:48.260
Well, I would have done it.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.383
- Stainer, you make me sick.
- Oh?

25:52.333 --> 25:54.502
You keep on talking, you
never do a damn thing.

25:54.583 --> 25:56.800
- Well, what can I do?
- Go and see the officer.

25:56.875 --> 25:59.293
- Oh, don't be mad.
- You'd be within your rights.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.880
Yes, and would they ever forget?

26:00.958 --> 26:03.803
I tell you, Lloyd,
they've got you where they want you.

26:04.917 --> 26:06.505
I'm going to see the officer.

26:07.625 --> 26:09.593
- Never.
- Is that wise?

26:09.667 --> 26:11.586
No, but I hate gasbags.

26:12.667 --> 26:14.504
What are you going to say, mate?

26:14.583 --> 26:16.384
I've got plenty to say.

26:16.458 --> 26:20.251
Be careful. Not mutiny.
You know what that leads to.

26:20.333 --> 26:22.218
Look out, look out, here he comes.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.757
All right. When you've done here,
report down to the quartermaster's stores.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.587
He's got some scrubbing for you.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.301
Oh, and by the way,

26:37.375 --> 26:41.547
the next man I catch around camp with his
hands in his pockets will be put on a charge.

26:41.625 --> 26:43.011
Got it? Right.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.802
- Sergeant?
- Yes.

26:44.875 --> 26:46.925
I want to see the officer, please.

26:48.292 --> 26:49.714
What for?

26:49.792 --> 26:51.795
My reasons are private.

26:53.125 --> 26:57.546
All right. Write out an application
in the proper manner and let me have it.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.344
And I'll see if Mr Perry can see you.

26:59.417 --> 27:00.673
Thanks, Sergeant.

27:00.750 --> 27:01.923
Right.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.299
When you all get through,
go down to the stores.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.425
- Look, Lloyd, I'll tell you what to say.
- Go to hell, Stainer.

27:13.042 --> 27:15.009
If there hadn't been this trouble at Crewe,

27:15.083 --> 27:17.880
you think Sergeant Fletcher
might have been easier on you?

27:17.958 --> 27:19.547
Yes, I do, sir.

27:19.625 --> 27:24.129
Now, these extra guard duties. According to the
rosters you've done no more than anybody else.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.543
Do you think that because
of the trouble at Crewe,

27:26.625 --> 27:29.303
you're blaming Sergeant Fletcher
for doing his job?

27:29.375 --> 27:31.212
It isn't only the guards, sir.

27:31.292 --> 27:33.377
You've been in the Army, what, six weeks?

27:33.458 --> 27:37.049
Isn't that a short time to decide
about a soldier like Sergeant Fletcher?

27:37.125 --> 27:40.135
I wouldn't have come to you, sir,
if I hadn't felt justified.

27:40.208 --> 27:44.380
You've made a complaint. I must investigate
it or refer it to the company commander.

27:44.458 --> 27:48.714
Do you want to refer it to Captain Edwards,
make a complaint in front of Sergeant Fletcher?

27:49.833 --> 27:51.339
I'd rather leave it to you, sir.

27:51.417 --> 27:53.550
- Very well, Lloyd.
- Thank you, sir.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.128
Sentries, pass!

27:59.750 --> 28:01.670
Quick march!

28:19.417 --> 28:21.254
Look here, Evan, I've been thinking.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.427
If he didn't actually say nothing,
he must have hinted.

28:24.500 --> 28:28.423
For the 100th time, he said
he'd look into it. That's all.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.135
Now, for goodness' sake, shut up.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.879
I told you it wouldn't do any good.

28:31.958 --> 28:33.926
But if he looks into it,
like what he said...

28:34.000 --> 28:35.719
Brewer, fetch the cocoa.

28:35.792 --> 28:37.510
Right, Sergeant.

28:37.583 --> 28:41.506
Won't be having cocoa at the sergeant's
mess party. Wine, women and song.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.467
Lily Of Laguna

28:52.125 --> 28:54.128
Wait till the competitions. I'll bet...

28:54.208 --> 28:56.046
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.507
- What'll it be? Bitter?
- Have a sandwich, sir?

28:58.583 --> 29:02.257
- What's Sergeant Major betting on?
- No.10 platoon, sir. Used to be his.

29:02.333 --> 29:06.589
- We don't mind taking his money, do we?
- I should hope not, sir.

29:06.667 --> 29:11.585
My old battalion were all Territorials, so I haven't
much experience of these men just called up.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.504
Do they usually make complaints?

29:13.583 --> 29:14.840
Lloyd, sir?

29:14.917 --> 29:16.126
Yes.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.342
All soldiers like a bit of a grumble, sir.

29:18.417 --> 29:21.628
After all, it's not funny to have to run
when you feel like walking,

29:21.708 --> 29:24.256
or stand up
when you feel you could do with a sit down.

29:24.333 --> 29:27.545
Or to have someone shout at you
when you're doing your best.

29:27.625 --> 29:30.587
No, I think it does a man good
to let off steam a bit, sir.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.919
Yes, if that's all it is.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.172
Well, they're new, sir. But there's
some good men there. Lloyd for one.

29:37.250 --> 29:41.007
He hasn't got the hang of it yet, but he
has the knack of handling men all right.

29:41.083 --> 29:44.343
He's a bit of a nuisance at the moment,
but later on he'll make an NCO.

29:44.417 --> 29:47.048
- Now, Luke...
- Got him onto that again, have you, sir?

29:47.125 --> 29:51.261
The adjutant is taking some of his men for the
mortar platoon. The way Fletcher carried on...

29:51.333 --> 29:53.834
Well, you'd think someone
was pinching his watch.

29:53.917 --> 29:57.970
He even said that professor bloke - Davenport -
 said he had the makings of a soldier.

29:58.042 --> 30:01.087
There's nothing wrong with him
that the Army won't put right.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.719
- Stainer?
- Yes, what about him?

30:02.792 --> 30:07.378
Same with him, sir. He was a bit of a mess when
he first came in, but he'll shake down in time.

30:07.458 --> 30:11.132
- We haven't got a dud there, sir.
- See what I mean? Optimistic.

30:15.083 --> 30:16.802
Same thing in France, too.

30:16.875 --> 30:20.798
If we'd only had the guns and planes
and tanks and things, it might all have...

30:20.875 --> 30:22.510
Well, anyway, that was that.

30:24.375 --> 30:27.800
There'll be no more of that nonsense.
There'll be a big change.

30:27.875 --> 30:31.004
- Things are going to be different from now on.
- Yes, sir.

30:31.083 --> 30:33.501
- Good evening, Brewer.
- Good evening, sir.

30:36.250 --> 30:39.212
Here, he's giving it to him.
He's giving it to him proper.

30:39.292 --> 30:41.425
- Who's giving what to who?
- The old screamer.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.380
- Perry's giving him a right dressing down.
- What did he say?

30:44.458 --> 30:49.045
He said things will be different. He wants
no nonsense. There's going to be a change.

30:49.125 --> 30:52.005
- What did the sergeant say?
- He says, "Yes, sir." That's all.

30:52.083 --> 30:55.508
Very slow, with a silly look on his face.
Almost human, he was.

30:55.583 --> 30:57.586
Had all the stuffing knocked out of him.

30:57.667 --> 30:59.504
Good for you, Evan. You're a plucky lad.

30:59.583 --> 31:01.503
- I owe you an apology.
- I don't know...

31:01.583 --> 31:06.467
From now on, he'll be as quiet as a little
lamb. Tomorrow he'll be saying please.

31:06.542 --> 31:08.959
Come on! You're light infantry,
not horse Marines!

31:09.042 --> 31:10.215
Truscott!

31:10.292 --> 31:13.136
Truscott, get that fat side over!

31:14.708 --> 31:17.126
- Parsons!
- Come on. Come on.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.595
Come on! Come on!

31:18.667 --> 31:21.547
Come on! Get out of it! Get out of it!

31:21.625 --> 31:23.758
Come on, Davenport!

31:23.833 --> 31:26.168
- Come on.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.632
- Come on, Davenport!
- Wait a minute.

31:31.833 --> 31:33.339
Oi!

31:37.542 --> 31:41.548
Get on with it, Luke!
What's the matter with you?

31:44.667 --> 31:46.800
Come on, Beck! Hurry up, hurry up!

31:46.875 --> 31:49.720
Come on, come on. Come on, Parsons!

31:49.792 --> 31:52.553
Come on! Come on, the rest of you!

31:52.625 --> 31:54.011
Come on, Truscott!

31:54.083 --> 31:56.501
- Can't you see I'm stuck?
- Well, get unstuck.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.754
Now what have you done?

32:03.333 --> 32:07.505
Don't hang about there, Lloyd!
Go back and take it in your stride!

32:07.583 --> 32:09.835
Quick as lightning you ought to be.

32:09.917 --> 32:12.418
Come on, Brewer, get some of that fat off!
Get over!

32:14.458 --> 32:17.006
Come on, Parsons! You can do it, lad!

32:17.083 --> 32:19.217
Use your brains. What's
the matter with you?

32:19.292 --> 32:21.010
Swing across! Don't fall!

32:25.125 --> 32:27.591
Brewer, double up, double up!

32:31.208 --> 32:33.626
Come on, Parsons.

32:33.708 --> 32:37.133
Right. You can use the mobile canteen.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.129
- What about it, Sergeant Fletcher?
- Not bad, sir. Not bad at all.

32:44.208 --> 32:46.543
Parsons held them up a bit
at the second obstacle.

32:46.625 --> 32:49.173
- What is the matter with him?
- I don't quite know, sir.

32:49.250 --> 32:52.794
Something's wrong. No grousing at all.
As if there was something on his mind.

32:54.250 --> 32:56.087
"Tomorrow he'll be saying please."

32:56.167 --> 32:59.378
- I only said what I heard.
- Well, you heard wrong.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.793
It's like I always said... Oh!

33:01.875 --> 33:04.506
The officer seemed to be enjoying the fun.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.337
Grinning he was. I saw him.

33:06.417 --> 33:09.095
"Things have got to be different."
That's what he said.

33:09.167 --> 33:12.094
- Oh, shut up.
- Well, I've come to a conclusion.

33:12.167 --> 33:14.170
- What's that?
- I don't like the Army.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.088
- Two flans, two teas.
- Razor blades?

33:16.167 --> 33:17.458
Sorry, no razor blades. Yes?

33:17.542 --> 33:19.545
Tea, please. And a piece of Swiss roll.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.214
All right, pay attention.

33:21.292 --> 33:22.678
Go on eating.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.595
Oh, here he comes.
He can't leave us alone for a minute.

33:25.667 --> 33:30.004
I'm supposed to organise this regimental
concert and I shall badly need some help.

33:30.083 --> 33:36.708
So, if any of you can play anything, dance, sing,
pull things out of hats, can I have your names?

33:40.667 --> 33:42.219
I shall need all the help I can get.

33:42.292 --> 33:45.717
- I do recitations. Shall I put my hand up?
- You do and I'll clock you.

33:45.792 --> 33:48.506
Well, think it over and let me know.

33:50.792 --> 33:52.795
Well, I nearly got knocked
down by the rush.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.546
Oh, they'll be all right, sir.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.426
Why don't you want to help him?

33:56.500 --> 33:58.337
He won't help us. Why should we help him?

33:58.417 --> 34:01.925
You don't seem to be having a very good
time. Don't you ever get into town?

34:02.000 --> 34:05.544
Occasionally, but there's only one cinema
and we've seen the film this week.

34:05.625 --> 34:07.047
Why don't you come over to tea?

34:07.125 --> 34:09.803
- Oh, yes, please.
- When?

34:09.875 --> 34:11.261
- Sunday.
- What, all of us?

34:11.333 --> 34:13.253
- Well...
- If we keep it down to seven.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.375
All right.

34:14.417 --> 34:16.467
- What time?
- Four? Half past?

34:16.542 --> 34:18.094
- Four.
- Who do we ask for?

34:18.167 --> 34:19.376
Marjorie Gillingham.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.928
Number 12 Ellmore Street.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.589
12 Ellmore Street.

34:22.667 --> 34:24.005
Right. Fall in.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.797
- All right, we'll find it.
- Goodbye.

34:26.875 --> 34:28.795
See you Sunday!

34:28.875 --> 34:30.130
Ring the bell.

34:30.208 --> 34:32.674
Steady. She may be looking
out of the window.

34:35.917 --> 34:37.505
Oh, hello, chaps.

34:37.583 --> 34:39.005
Mrs Gillingham?

34:39.083 --> 34:41.667
That's right. Come in, boys.
How many of you are there?

34:41.750 --> 34:44.511
- Just the seven, Sergeant.
- Oh, quite a party.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.303
- Last man in, shut the door, will you?
- OK, Sergeant.

34:48.375 --> 34:50.543
Charming house you have here.

34:50.625 --> 34:52.628
Bit of a change after our barrack room.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.130
Less congestion.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.257
Yeah, more room, too.

34:56.333 --> 34:59.344
Sit down anywhere.
Mrs Gillingham will be down in a minute.

34:59.958 --> 35:01.594
How are you liking the Army?

35:01.667 --> 35:03.966
- Need you ask?
- I expect you'll get over that.

35:04.042 --> 35:06.127
Been in long?

35:06.208 --> 35:08.709
- Seven weeks. Seems like years.
- I know.

35:08.792 --> 35:11.044
- What are you in? Bombers?
- No, fighters.

35:11.125 --> 35:13.128
- On leave?
- Sick leave.

35:13.208 --> 35:15.425
- You're lucky.
- We could do with a bit of that.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.633
- How do you wangle it?
- Were you really sick?

35:17.708 --> 35:19.877
Well, shot up a bit.

35:19.958 --> 35:22.506
Oh, but I'm all right now, though.

35:22.583 --> 35:24.302
See this wristwatch?

35:24.375 --> 35:26.592
Amazing. It landed five
miles from where I did.

35:26.667 --> 35:29.250
They told me it was still going
when they picked it up.

35:29.333 --> 35:32.794
Some farmer chap found it. Bit of luck, eh?

35:32.875 --> 35:34.546
Of course, I didn't really mean...

35:34.625 --> 35:37.091
Hello. So, you got here all right.

35:37.167 --> 35:38.838
Mother will be down in a minute.

35:38.917 --> 35:41.595
Come on, Buster.
Hurry or we'll miss the beginning.

35:41.667 --> 35:46.218
Well, so long, boys. Going to see that Merchant
Navy picture. Marvellous job those chaps do.

35:46.292 --> 35:48.295
And they don't wear a uniform. Come on.

35:48.375 --> 35:49.418
Goodbye.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.550
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:57.667 --> 36:01.625
I wish we wore uniforms with a collar and
tie. This makes you feel like a convict.

36:01.708 --> 36:03.546
Well, what do you think you are?

36:04.875 --> 36:07.458
Oh, how do you do?

36:07.542 --> 36:09.011
I'm Marjorie's mother.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.549
I'm so glad she persuaded
you to come along.

36:11.625 --> 36:14.671
The boys in the battalion before you
always used to come.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.339
Oh, thank you so much.

36:16.417 --> 36:20.470
So did the boys from the ack-ack battery,
until they moved.

36:20.542 --> 36:25.674
I always say, if Marjorie can have her canteen,
I don't see why I shouldn't have mine.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.216
Now, do sit down, please, all of you.

36:28.292 --> 36:31.136
There, that's right.
Yes, that's the comfortable chair.

36:31.208 --> 36:33.425
And you can put your plate
on the table there.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.717
This is extremely kind
of you, Mrs Gillingham.

36:35.792 --> 36:38.209
That's right. Oh, dear.

36:38.292 --> 36:43.092
I'm afraid this place is rather untidy,
but this house is really too big for me.

36:43.167 --> 36:45.300
Now, do make yourselves at home.

36:47.042 --> 36:49.459
Well, and how do you like the Army?

36:49.542 --> 36:50.881
We don't.

36:50.958 --> 36:55.296
Oh, dear, what a pity. Now, hands up
for China tea and hands up for Indian.

36:58.875 --> 37:02.668
And then what does he do? He has us
marching till our feet are nearly bleeding.

37:02.750 --> 37:05.511
I tell you he's a proper b...
A very nasty fellow.

37:05.583 --> 37:09.802
And the officer just smiled and then asked
for volunteers for the camp concert.

37:09.875 --> 37:13.466
Both the sergeant and the officer
are as bad as each other, Mrs Gillingham.

37:13.542 --> 37:15.213
That's right, ma'am. It's true.

37:15.292 --> 37:19.168
Oh, dear, it is a shame, isn't it?
Who'd like another chocolate biscuit?

37:19.250 --> 37:21.833
Well, they haven't taken your appetite
away from you.

37:21.917 --> 37:24.548
The food's not good enough for that,
Mrs Gillingham.

37:24.625 --> 37:28.003
Terrible. Since we've been in the Army,
we haven't had a proper bath.

37:28.083 --> 37:30.133
- Well, a shower's quicker.
- Shut up.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.970
You can always have one here
if you bring your towels.

37:33.042 --> 37:36.052
Only, let me know in time.
I have such trouble with the boiler.

37:36.125 --> 37:38.922
Oh? What do you burn?
What sort of boiler is it?

37:39.000 --> 37:43.136
I could probably show you a saving. I'll pop
in sometime and have a look at it for you.

37:43.208 --> 37:46.633
I wish you would. Marjorie's friend Buster
couldn't do anything with it,

37:46.708 --> 37:49.589
and, naturally,
he knows all about engines and things.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.345
You poor lads. Your life
sounds terribly gloomy.

37:52.417 --> 37:55.214
It is, Mrs Gillingham, it is.

37:55.292 --> 37:57.674
But you said just now
you have concerts and things.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.670
Yes, if we do the acting.

37:59.750 --> 38:02.547
There was a boy in the ack-ack
used to recite a lot.

38:02.625 --> 38:05.505
There was one poem -
The Lynching Of Black Maguire.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.503
How did it start?

38:07.583 --> 38:10.594
It was hot that summer in Kicking Horse...

38:10.667 --> 38:12.468
And the earth was parched and dry.

38:12.542 --> 38:15.090
Full of geographical licence,
but exciting stuff.

38:15.167 --> 38:17.881
- Good old Sid. Why don't you volunteer?
- Maybe I will.

38:17.958 --> 38:22.130
- You know what I told you.
- Och, away, Ted. Let him do it if he wants to.

38:22.208 --> 38:24.709
Well, I thought I was joining the Army,
not a circus.

38:24.792 --> 38:26.842
It's time we went. There's
that fire picket.

38:26.917 --> 38:30.093
Do come again next week,
and, don't forget, bring your towels.

38:30.167 --> 38:33.509
- You're not going already, are you?
- They've got to fire-watch.

38:33.583 --> 38:36.464
Now, don't you let the
other boys bully you.

38:36.542 --> 38:39.753
If you want to volunteer for the concert,
you jolly well do.

38:42.667 --> 38:45.049
- Try it again without holding it.
- Right, sir.

38:45.125 --> 38:47.377
Close them.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.177
Now open.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.885
Oh, that's perfect.

38:50.958 --> 38:52.878
Everything all right?

38:52.958 --> 38:57.675
Yes, thank you, sir. We had a lot of trouble
with the curtains, but they're working now.

38:57.750 --> 39:01.045
Old Colonel Walmsley's coming over
and bringing a band,

39:01.125 --> 39:04.503
and he's also going to do some monologues.
He's been very helpful, sir.

39:04.583 --> 39:07.345
Well, the brigadier's coming.
What are our men doing?

39:07.417 --> 39:10.676
Well, Cook Sergeant Trubshaw
is going to do his bird noises, sir.

39:10.750 --> 39:13.595
- Beck in my platoon's going to do something.
- Good.

39:13.667 --> 39:17.294
"It was hot that summer in Kicking Horse,
and the earth was parched and dry."

39:17.375 --> 39:19.592
- Why parched and dry?
- It's parched and dry.

39:19.667 --> 39:21.219
"And the town was full..."

39:21.292 --> 39:24.053
Get on with it, Sid. The
exercise starts tomorrow.

39:24.125 --> 39:26.970
Exercise!
Three days in the open, firing blanks.

39:27.042 --> 39:30.088
Questions ought to be asked
in the 'Ouse about it. Waste of time.

39:30.167 --> 39:34.588
Listen, listen. Look, would you do it like this
just to make the earth seem parched and dry?

39:34.667 --> 39:37.084
"And the earth was parched and dry."

39:37.167 --> 39:38.755
Yes, that's good.

39:38.833 --> 39:40.255
No, it looks absurd.

39:40.333 --> 39:42.585
Make up your minds. I've
got to do it in a minute.

39:42.667 --> 39:45.250
You ought to have thought of that.
Serves you right.

39:45.333 --> 39:48.463
I'll laugh when you forget your words,
with the brass hats there.

39:48.542 --> 39:50.379
I only did it because Mrs Gillingham...

39:50.458 --> 39:52.793
I know, I know. Come on, my lucky lads.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.127
Oh! After you, Mr Barrymore.

39:55.208 --> 39:59.464
Never mind them, son. Carry on.
Black Maguire in town. Coming?

39:59.542 --> 40:01.675
- In a minute.
- Go on, son.

40:01.750 --> 40:03.919
It might be better
if you sing it, Sid.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.423
The first item tonight is a band.

40:17.292 --> 40:19.342
We are lucky to have with
us the six Pollocks,

40:19.417 --> 40:22.297
who have come all the way from Hacklesfield
to entertain us.

40:26.042 --> 40:27.961
The men always like a dance band.

40:37.417 --> 40:39.751
One, two, three.

40:39.833 --> 40:42.417
♪ Gentle pastoral tune

40:56.792 --> 40:58.676
Who are these people?

40:58.750 --> 41:01.002
The Pollocks.

41:11.333 --> 41:13.052
Halt!

41:13.125 --> 41:16.219
Corporal Langley, Military Police,
with prisoner and escort.

41:16.292 --> 41:18.591
Advance, prisoner and escort.

41:22.958 --> 41:26.253
I wonder why I do not care,

41:26.333 --> 41:29.628
For the things that are
like the things that were.

41:29.708 --> 41:31.344
Does...

41:31.417 --> 41:37.295
Does half my heart lie buried there,
down by the Rio Grande?

41:37.375 --> 41:40.172
- All ready, Beck?
- Yes, sir.

41:45.333 --> 41:48.344
- Now, what do I announce?
- The Lynching Of Black Maguire.

41:48.417 --> 41:50.218
Does the applause warrant an encore?

41:50.292 --> 41:53.385
- Well, there's Beck here, sir...
- That's quite all right.

41:53.458 --> 41:55.213
Now, come along, come along.

41:55.292 --> 41:57.211
Yes, that's all right. That's all right.

41:58.667 --> 42:03.716
For an encore, I propose to give you
that well-known dramatic poem,

42:03.792 --> 42:07.501
The Lynching Of Black Maguire.

42:12.292 --> 42:15.421
It was hot that summer...

42:15.500 --> 42:17.752
I'll bet Perry knew this
was going to happen.

42:17.833 --> 42:19.801
The earth was parched and dry.

42:19.875 --> 42:24.094
And the town was full of
the frontier force...

42:24.167 --> 42:27.959
Though nobody seemed to know why.

42:29.042 --> 42:30.926
That was my piece, sir!

42:31.000 --> 42:33.299
- Can you do anything else?
- Nope.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.460
May I have a word with you, sir?

42:35.542 --> 42:37.177
What is it?

42:37.250 --> 42:43.046
Men looked with their eyes,
nor was there a sound...

42:43.125 --> 42:44.168
Oh...

42:44.250 --> 42:46.751
For looks were as hard as knives.

42:46.833 --> 42:50.507
- If what?
For looks were as hard as knives.

42:50.583 --> 42:53.594
For looks were as hard as knives.

42:53.667 --> 42:58.301
The MPs caught him trying to board the
London train. I've got him outside now, sir.

42:58.375 --> 43:01.255
- I'll see him as soon as this thing's over.
- Very good, sir.

43:01.333 --> 43:04.462
As the sun went down, all there could see,

43:04.542 --> 43:11.001
Against the glowing ball of fire,
hanging from the highest tree,

43:11.083 --> 43:15.172
The body of Black Maguire.

43:18.208 --> 43:19.963
Go on, Parsons.

43:21.042 --> 43:25.130
Well, when we were married,
we didn't think about a war and...

43:25.208 --> 43:27.840
and I got all the furniture
on the hire purchase.

43:27.917 --> 43:33.380
Well, I was called up and with the money not
coming in, we got behind with the payments.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.674
They've been bullying the wife.
Lawyers' letters and people at the door.

43:39.958 --> 43:43.253
Now they're going to
take the furniture away.

43:43.333 --> 43:48.085
She's sick with worry, and with the baby coming
and everything, she doesn't know where to turn.

43:49.167 --> 43:52.296
- So you were off home?
- Yes, sir.

43:52.375 --> 43:55.006
How were you going to deal
with all these lawyers?

43:55.083 --> 43:58.378
Well, they don't do that kind of thing
when there's a man around.

43:58.458 --> 44:00.592
It's just because she's a woman.

44:00.667 --> 44:03.298
I don't think a deserter
would be much help to her.

44:03.375 --> 44:05.923
I don't know what I was going to do, sir.

44:07.458 --> 44:09.461
May I see one of these letters?

44:18.583 --> 44:23.881
Being in the Army has a lot of disadvantages,
but there is one compensation.

44:23.958 --> 44:26.044
You're not alone any more against anyone.

44:26.125 --> 44:28.886
Germans or furniture shops.

44:30.542 --> 44:33.339
- Do they know you're in the Army?
- Well, yes, sir.

44:35.375 --> 44:38.136
Well, I can put your mind at rest
about one thing, Parsons.

44:38.208 --> 44:42.759
This is not from a lawyer. It's a cheap debt
collector's letter dressed up to look frightening.

44:42.833 --> 44:44.552
They can't touch your furniture.

44:44.625 --> 44:46.959
- But it says there, sir...
- It's just a trick.

44:47.042 --> 44:49.459
I only wish you'd seen
me about this before.

44:51.083 --> 44:54.710
Well, I'm sorry, sir. You know how...

44:55.833 --> 44:57.588
Yes?

44:57.667 --> 44:59.883
No, nothing, sir.

45:04.750 --> 45:07.084
Well, it's rather out of
my hands now, Parsons.

45:07.167 --> 45:11.836
You'll go before the Colonel in the morning. In
the meantime, you'll remain in close arrest.

45:11.917 --> 45:15.342
- What time is Orderly Room?
- Eight, sir. We march the exercise half past.

45:15.417 --> 45:18.711
Right. I'll be there, Parsons.
I'll do what I can for you.

45:18.792 --> 45:20.877
- All right, Sergeant Fletcher.
- Sir.

45:20.958 --> 45:22.961
All right, Parsons, fall in.

45:47.042 --> 45:49.009
I think Parsons is well out of this.

45:49.083 --> 45:51.169
I'd rather be here than in the glasshouse.

45:51.250 --> 45:53.383
I wonder why he didn't
tell us about it before.

45:53.458 --> 45:56.753
Whatever it is, we won't recognise him
when he gets out of that place.

45:56.833 --> 45:59.132
Persecuted for a few sticks of furniture.

45:59.208 --> 46:01.460
I reckon they'll give him field punishment.

Come down here and I'll tell you!

I bet they slept in that
lorry the last two nights.

Actually, it's not as comfy as a ditch,
if you put a groundsheet down.

46:12.792 --> 46:15.636

- Oh, put a sock in it.

Why don't you look where you're going?

46:43.708 --> 46:48.923
And, remember, Perry, everything depends on your
getting that bridge quickly and holding it.

Out of it already, Corporal?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.382
Umpire ruled us dead.
We got caught in the open.

47:05.458 --> 47:08.173
- They had a Bren gun on us.
- Oh, bad luck.

47:08.250 --> 47:10.134
Good luck, I call it.

47:10.208 --> 47:11.299

We've got to get there without being seen,
so make the best use of the ground.

47:19.875 --> 47:22.174

47:26.125 --> 47:27.595
Not this way. They'll see us.

Stop the section. I'll go round
here to the right and have a look.

47:32.750 --> 47:34.302

I am thinking of them. Why should we stay
out here for hours? Why can't we get back?

47:40.708 --> 47:42.130
Easy said, mate.

47:42.208 --> 47:45.468
Easy done, too. We could get killed.
It often happens on battlefields.

47:45.542 --> 47:48.220
- What, killed intentional? That's not fair.
- Shut up.

47:52.417 --> 47:55.546
- This is all right. Tell them to come on.
- Very good, sir.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.050
Best use of ground.

48:04.917 --> 48:06.718
Lloyd, what do we do?

48:06.792 --> 48:09.340
Follow me. When I give
the word, do as I do.

48:12.875 --> 48:14.712
Now!

48:24.750 --> 48:26.835
- Watch your front.
- There they are, sir.

48:30.875 --> 48:33.553
♪ Loch Lomond

48:35.417 --> 48:37.420
Won't be long now.

48:44.292 --> 48:46.211
Home sweet home. I wonder what's for tea.

48:46.292 --> 48:50.001
I don't care as long as there's pickles,
then a lovely, long pint of beer.

48:50.083 --> 48:51.719
I'll come with you, mate.

48:51.792 --> 48:53.877
- Look who's here.
- Where did you come from?

48:53.958 --> 48:55.380
Did they give you hell?

48:55.458 --> 48:57.544
- Or haven't you been?
- Yes, I've been.

48:57.625 --> 48:59.842
- What did they do to you?
- Gave me 48 hours.

48:59.917 --> 49:00.959
What to do?

49:01.042 --> 49:02.961
Go to London, get things straightened up.

49:03.042 --> 49:07.000
- There, you see.
- I thought you weren't coming back till tonight.

49:07.083 --> 49:10.046
Oh, we did extra special well,
so they said we needn't stay.

49:10.125 --> 49:13.965
We've Evan to thank for that. He should be
the officer. We'd do all right, eh, boys?

49:14.042 --> 49:17.135
You'd better get your wet things off
instead of talking.

49:22.333 --> 49:24.171
What happened with the Colonel?

49:24.250 --> 49:27.959
Of course, I had the wind up at first,
but Perry was there and spoke for me.

49:28.042 --> 49:31.218
The Colonel chewed me up properly,
but it wasn't too bad.

49:31.292 --> 49:35.168
Perry's fixing up about a War Emergency
Grant for me. Hilda's ever so pleased.

49:36.458 --> 49:39.504
- How did you come to get back?
- Influence.

49:39.583 --> 49:43.044
Well, we're home again, anyway.
Oh, you lovely bed.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.585
I wonder what the others are doing.

49:46.667 --> 49:49.464
Probably still capturing bridges,
covered with mud.

49:49.542 --> 49:51.296
Serves 'em right.

49:51.375 --> 49:53.378
Blimey. Look out. Here he is.

50:01.833 --> 50:05.507
Tea's ready in the cookhouse, sir.
Shall I march them down, sir?

50:10.292 --> 50:13.053
Pity we didn't see it through, sir, eh?

50:18.667 --> 50:23.004
When this regiment was formed,
our country was doing pretty badly.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.338
Napoleon's armies were just across
the Channel, getting ready to invade us.

50:28.417 --> 50:32.672
We'd had defeat after defeat and a great
many people thought we were finished.

50:33.917 --> 50:37.010
We weren't, but not because we were lucky.

50:37.083 --> 50:41.385
When the first battalion of this regiment
marched, it was against Napoleon.

50:41.458 --> 50:45.002
Talavera, 1809. That was the first
battle they made their own.

50:45.083 --> 50:48.378
They marched 42 miles in 24 hours
of a Spanish summer,

50:48.458 --> 50:52.085
and every man jack of
them carried a 60lb pack.

50:52.167 --> 50:54.501
Talavera - it's on your cap badges.

50:54.583 --> 50:56.800
The other battles, too
- Barossa, Sabugal...

50:56.875 --> 51:01.758
At Sabugal, with four companies of riflemen,
they defeated five times Napoleon's troops.

51:01.833 --> 51:06.089
Salamanca, Orthez, Waterloo,
Alma, Sebastopol,

51:06.167 --> 51:09.177
Tel el Kabir, Mons, Ypres, Somme.

51:09.250 --> 51:11.668
Those are battle honours.

51:11.750 --> 51:14.595
You're allowed to wear that badge
with those names on it

51:14.667 --> 51:17.250
to show that you belong
to the regiment that won them,

51:17.333 --> 51:20.214
and that when the time comes,
you'll do as well as they did.

51:20.292 --> 51:22.793
Last year, that badge was in France.

51:22.875 --> 51:24.843
This year, in Libya.

51:24.917 --> 51:27.334
It hasn't been disgraced yet.

51:27.417 --> 51:29.467
Now you're wearing it.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.133
I know what went wrong today.

51:35.208 --> 51:37.342
It so happens that Captain Edwards doesn't.

51:37.417 --> 51:39.550
You needn't worry. I'm
not going to tell him.

51:39.625 --> 51:44.295
He's quite depressed as it is to think that it was
his company that let the whole battalion down.

51:44.375 --> 51:46.212
But I just want to tell you this.

51:47.333 --> 51:51.505
If you ever get near any real fighting -
I don't suppose you'll ever be good enough -

51:51.583 --> 51:56.004
but if you do, you'll find that you're
looking to other men not to let you down.

51:56.083 --> 52:00.670
If you're lucky, you'll have soldiers like Captain
Edwards and Sergeant Fletcher to look to.

52:00.750 --> 52:04.341
If they're lucky, they'll
be with another company.

52:06.042 --> 52:08.803
All right, Sergeant Fletcher,
they can have their tea.

52:08.875 --> 52:10.464
Platoon, 'shun!

52:12.917 --> 52:17.005
All right, get the rest of your stuff off
and fall in outside in five minutes.

52:26.125 --> 52:28.009
What's up?

52:28.083 --> 52:30.928
To hear him talk, you'd
think we'd lost the war.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.091
Yes.

52:32.167 --> 52:34.217
He'll be as bad as the sergeant now.

52:40.625 --> 52:44.003
Come on, Johnson! Come on!
Mr Perry's miles ahead! Let's catch him up!

53:01.708 --> 53:04.091
One more go
for the day you missed on the exercise.

53:22.042 --> 53:23.630
Was that any better, sir?

53:25.417 --> 53:27.882
- 17½. Sergeant Fletcher!
- Sir?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.884
- What was it this time, sir?
- 17½.

53:34.958 --> 53:37.459
- That's better than the other platoons, sir.
- Yes.

53:37.542 --> 53:42.176
Hoo! 17½ minutes.
That doesn't sound humanly possible.

53:42.250 --> 53:44.798
You didn't do it in 17½.
You were right behind.

53:44.875 --> 53:47.672
- So was Bert. Weren't you?
- Just in front of you, though.

53:47.750 --> 53:51.341
Ah, what does it matter? He doesn't
care if we break our perishin' necks.

53:51.417 --> 53:54.297
How much better do we have to be
to get a thank-you out of him?

53:54.375 --> 53:55.927
- I don't blame him.
- What?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.715
- Listen who's talking.
- He's been jolly decent to me.

53:58.792 --> 54:01.174
You weren't there, you twerp, so shut up.

54:02.292 --> 54:04.342
We only did it for a joke, anyway.

54:04.417 --> 54:06.799
You'd think he'd be decent
enough to see that.

54:06.875 --> 54:08.001
- Parsons!
- Sergeant.

54:08.083 --> 54:09.256
Over here.

54:12.250 --> 54:17.382
Well, we've asked for it and we've got it.
For the duration.

54:17.458 --> 54:19.508
Cunning little beggar, sucking up.

54:21.250 --> 54:24.260
- If Bill doesn't come soon, there'll be no tea.
- Good. Serve him right.

54:24.333 --> 54:27.095
I wonder what he was sucking up
to Perry and Fletcher for.

54:27.167 --> 54:29.335
Trying to get some more
leave, I should think.

54:29.417 --> 54:31.254
- So long, boys.
- Cheerio, Marjorie.

54:31.333 --> 54:33.716
- Steady on with that sugar.
- Here are the scones.

54:34.833 --> 54:36.883
Isn't Bill down yet?

54:36.958 --> 54:39.092
I do hope the bath water's still hot.

54:39.167 --> 54:41.383
- How's the leg now, Bert?
- Thank you.

54:41.458 --> 54:43.675
It's rather worse since
I put the iodine on it.

54:43.750 --> 54:45.302
It'll be better later, I expect.

54:45.375 --> 54:49.084
You should see my leg, Mrs Gillingham.
It's got a bruise as big as that plate.

54:49.167 --> 54:51.170
Just put those down there to keep hot, Ted.

54:51.250 --> 54:54.296
It's agony to move it.
I did it on that perishing tree obstacle.

54:54.375 --> 54:57.255
Take it slower if you can't do
it without hurting yourself.

54:57.333 --> 55:01.635
I didn't notice you taking it slower. You were
so busy trying to impress our loving officer.

55:01.708 --> 55:03.379
- Look here!
- Shut up, both of you.

55:03.458 --> 55:05.010
Boys, boys!

55:05.083 --> 55:07.086
I don't know what's come over you lately.

55:07.167 --> 55:09.881
- Well...
- Now, stop quarrelling and eat your scones.

55:09.958 --> 55:11.926
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.046
Ah, here's Bill. Now, he's not grumpy.

55:15.125 --> 55:17.459
- Sorry I've been so long.
- That's all right.

55:17.542 --> 55:19.047
Ted, give Bill a scone.

55:19.125 --> 55:20.926
Oh, do have a scone, Lord Fauntleroy.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.968
Oh, I wonder who that can be.

55:23.042 --> 55:25.839
Sure you wouldn't rather sit here, Bill?
It's more comfy.

55:25.917 --> 55:27.718
Thanks, Geoff. Very nice of you.

55:29.167 --> 55:31.170
Oh, it's another soldier.

55:35.458 --> 55:38.090
- It's Fletcher.
- What?

55:38.167 --> 55:39.719
Fletcher.

55:39.792 --> 55:41.842
He asked me about baths at the camp.

55:41.917 --> 55:43.422
So that's what it was.

55:44.958 --> 55:47.803
- And you told him about this place?
- Yes.

55:47.875 --> 55:51.134
You... BF, you.

55:51.833 --> 55:52.875
Listen.

55:52.917 --> 55:54.635
- Mrs Gillingham?
- Yes.

55:54.708 --> 55:58.797
I heard you were kind enough to let
people have baths, and I wondered if...

55:58.875 --> 56:01.838
Oh, yes. Do come in.
It's no trouble at all.

56:01.917 --> 56:05.093
I know how difficult it is
for you boys at the camp.

56:06.167 --> 56:08.798
Perhaps you'd like some tea
while the water heats up.

56:08.875 --> 56:10.759
Oh, thank you very much.

56:10.833 --> 56:13.168
- Er... What's your name?
- Perry.

56:14.917 --> 56:16.967
This is Perry, boys.

56:19.292 --> 56:20.797
Oh, we have met.

56:20.875 --> 56:22.759
You know each other. That's splendid.

56:22.833 --> 56:26.377
I hope you haven't got the same dreadful
officer these poor lads have got.

56:28.875 --> 56:30.427
Same one.

56:30.500 --> 56:33.297
Well, not really dreadful.

56:33.375 --> 56:36.670
- I suppose you find it very trying, too.
- Yes.

56:38.542 --> 56:41.422
I'll pop down and tune up the boiler again.
It's no trouble.

56:41.500 --> 56:44.594
Oh, dear.
He doesn't really understand it very well.

56:44.667 --> 56:46.717
- Sugar?
- Please.

56:46.792 --> 56:50.300
I...I think perhaps I'd better go down
and see what he's doing.

56:52.208 --> 56:54.591
Charming woman, Mrs Gillingham, sir.

56:54.667 --> 56:56.053
Yes, she seems very nice.

56:57.125 --> 57:02.209
Aye. She... She lets us have
baths here every week, sir.

57:02.292 --> 57:04.757
Oh, you're lucky. No thanks, I've got some.

57:04.833 --> 57:08.886
Any truth in the rumour, sir,
that the sergeant major's got bronchitis?

57:08.958 --> 57:10.878
Just lost his voice on parade, I think.

57:10.958 --> 57:13.969
- Shouting, sir?
- Just giving orders, Stainer.

57:14.042 --> 57:15.381
Yes, sir.

57:16.958 --> 57:19.839
- Will you have a cake, sir?
- Oh, thank you.

57:22.167 --> 57:24.217
You shouldn't have bothered, Ted.

57:24.292 --> 57:26.010
- Here, Mrs G?
- Yes?

57:26.083 --> 57:28.549
You know that officer we was talking about?

57:28.625 --> 57:30.593
- Who, the horror?
- That's him.

57:31.667 --> 57:33.385
Perry?

57:34.417 --> 57:36.088
- Oh, what did I say?
- I know.

57:37.167 --> 57:39.217
Oh, my goodness!

57:39.292 --> 57:41.342
I wonder what I'd better do now.

57:41.417 --> 57:44.379
Well, it'll take at least a half an hour
for this to heat up.

57:44.458 --> 57:47.385
- I wonder if we could tell him that...
- That it's going out?

57:47.458 --> 57:49.627
I'm sure the lads would
appreciate it, Mrs G.

57:49.708 --> 57:51.676
Oh, I don't quite like to do that.

57:51.750 --> 57:55.210
Well, you see, it's very awkward.
Him and us don't get on well together.

57:55.292 --> 57:58.468
- Still...
- This'll go out in any case. You see this?

57:58.542 --> 58:00.461
- It don't work.
- No.

58:00.542 --> 58:03.422
I always do... this.

58:05.250 --> 58:07.300
Yes, well, of course you can do that.

58:07.375 --> 58:11.630
Well, of course, if you don't get on together,
perhaps it would be better if he went.

58:11.708 --> 58:13.463
- I'll tell him.
- Thanks, Mrs G.

58:14.958 --> 58:18.336
The thing I never discovered was
who did lynch Black Maguire.

58:18.417 --> 58:21.344
- Well, sir, I was just going to explain.
- Oh, it was suicide.

58:21.417 --> 58:25.174
It was not suicide, sir.
The whole poem is really based on fact.

58:25.250 --> 58:29.007
Actually, a lot of people believe
that Black Maguire was never lynched.

58:29.083 --> 58:31.667
Mr Perry, the water will
be hot in a few minutes.

58:31.750 --> 58:33.302
Oh, thank you.

58:35.917 --> 58:40.053
Well, the next time we have a concert, sir,
I expect Luke could play us the bagpipes.

58:40.125 --> 58:41.879
Certainly. If they'd like it.

58:41.958 --> 58:44.459
As long as he doesn't
practise in the barracks.

58:44.542 --> 58:47.125
- It's a bit near the company office.

58:47.208 --> 58:48.418
I used to study jazz, sir.

58:48.500 --> 58:52.293
If there is another concert, I could
probably do some hot drumming or crooning.

58:52.375 --> 58:53.797
Spare us that.

58:53.875 --> 58:57.253
- What are you doing in the next concert, Ted?
- Concert? Who, me?

58:57.333 --> 58:58.839
Oh, I couldn't do nothing, sir.

58:58.917 --> 59:02.674
We wouldn't want a shambles like last time.
There must be something you can do.

59:02.750 --> 59:05.251
Well, I might... tell a few of my stories.

59:05.333 --> 59:07.550
I don't think the brigadier
would like that.

59:07.625 --> 59:11.963
Maybe he wouldn't like 'em in public, sir, but
if I could get him alone, he'd be delighted.

59:12.042 --> 59:13.712
I don't know. I tried that once.

59:14.833 --> 59:17.511
Captain Edwards seems quite pleased
with the platoon.

59:17.583 --> 59:20.345
- What, with us, sir?
- Apparently, we've improved a lot.

59:20.417 --> 59:22.254
How do we compare with the others, sir?

59:22.333 --> 59:24.834
Oh, they've been at it a good deal longer
than we have.

59:24.917 --> 59:27.216
- Well, we can do anything they can do, sir.
- Yes!

59:28.333 --> 59:29.755
I'll hold you to that.

59:29.833 --> 59:32.844
By the way, I heard something
else that might interest you.

59:32.917 --> 59:34.339
Leave starts next week.

59:34.417 --> 59:36.087
What, for all of us, sir?

59:36.167 --> 59:37.802
Here, sir?

59:37.875 --> 59:42.011
Have you heard that one about the old man
with the long white beard in the nudist camp?

59:44.375 --> 59:47.919
This is Crewe. Crewe Station.
Crewe.

59:47.958 --> 59:49.168
Jim!

59:49.250 --> 59:51.419
Passengers for Liverpool, Shrewsbury...

59:51.500 --> 59:52.673
Jim!

59:52.750 --> 59:55.844
..and Hacklesfield should change here.

01:00:00.542 --> 01:00:01.632
Come on, London train.

01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:04.209
- What will you do when you get home?
- Put slippers on.

01:00:04.292 --> 01:00:07.136
- What after that, Ted?
- Send the kids off to the pictures.

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:08.760
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, sir.

01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:10.967
- Have a good leave.
- Thank you, sir.

01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:12.381
Two whiskies.

01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:14.841
Are those the awful men
you wrote to me about?

01:00:14.917 --> 01:00:17.002
No, that's another lot. Quite different.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:22.218
- So that's his missus, eh? A nice bit of stuff.
- Turn it up, will you?

01:00:22.292 --> 01:00:24.460
- Porter, Cardiff?
- 10.43. This platform.

01:00:24.542 --> 01:00:26.924
- What's happened to the old 10.31?
- Took it off.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.552
Go on! Lovely service, that was.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.794
- Is the Glasgow train over the bridge?
- Yes.

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:32.345
Is that us?

01:00:32.417 --> 01:00:35.676
- Certainly is.
- Kensal Rise, here I come!

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:40.585
- Come on, Ted. Ta-ta, Geoff. Ta-ta, Luke!
- See you down there, eh?

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.378
Home sweet 'ome.

01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:46.047
Workers' Playtime!

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:47.879
- Turn it off.
- I want it on.

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.428
- Turn it off, I say.
- No!

01:00:50.542 --> 01:00:52.592
- Turn it off!
- Ted!

01:00:52.667 --> 01:00:56.294
She's your daughter.
She's got a mind of her own, too.

01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:00.468
All right. Turn it up a bit louder.

01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:04.422
- I suppose the Army's still all potato-peeling.
- No.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.711
You should have joined the Welsh Guards.
They sing beautifully.

01:01:07.792 --> 01:01:10.837
Light Infantry move faster, Mrs Daniels.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.884
- What's this on your cap?
- Badge.

01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:15.921
I know that, Evan, I'm not daft.
But what does it say? Tala...

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.252
There you are. Talavera
was a battle we fought.

01:01:18.333 --> 01:01:21.011
- Did you win it?
- Of course. Those are battle honours.

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:23.418
Look at the rest - Busaco,
Barossa, Sabugal.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:27.506
- You can't fight any war without infantry.
- Infantry stuff's as old as the hills.

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:30.380
Air power, tanks - they're the new weapons.
Engines of war.

01:01:30.458 --> 01:01:33.967
The only engine the infantryman has
is his body, which has limitations.

01:01:34.042 --> 01:01:35.132
I don't agree.

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:36.844
- What I mean is...
- Listen, Sam.

01:01:36.917 --> 01:01:40.544
An infantryman is one of the most
highly-skilled technical men in the Army.

01:01:40.625 --> 01:01:45.010
He has to be a mechanic, a gunner, an explosives
expert and an athlete, to begin with.

01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:48.841
He has a greater variety of weapons
than all the rest of the Army put together.

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:52.591
Then he has to be trained in not just
one sort of tactics, but in every sort.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:55.796
Street fighting, tank hunting,
wood clearing, and all the rest.

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:57.960
That's what we're going
onto when I get back.

01:01:58.042 --> 01:02:01.004
Has the quality deteriorated, Mr Thyrtle?

01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:03.761
Not really, Mr Davenport. It's old stock.

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:09.510
Of course, those cupid birdbaths that used to
be two guineas, they come out at £4.10.0 now.

01:02:09.583 --> 01:02:11.337
Purchase tax, of course.

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:14.427
If I were the public, Thyrtle,
I'd do without a birdbath.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.752
- That's what it does.
- It does?

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:19.085
But the public must be made to buy.

01:02:19.167 --> 01:02:22.047
Has the war completely
deprived us of initiative?

01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:23.334
Watch.

01:02:23.417 --> 01:02:25.467
Yes, madam. What can we show you?

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:31.253
What happened to Betty and Joyce, then?

01:02:31.333 --> 01:02:35.470
Betty's in munitions, Joyce is in the ATS.
Got her commission.

01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:38.339
Should've thought you'd
have got yours by now.

01:02:38.417 --> 01:02:40.882
Oh, they tried to get me to take one.
I didn't want it.

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:45.379
No stripes, no pips, no responsibility.
Just a nice easy life with the boys.

01:02:53.542 --> 01:02:55.710
Ssh, Tracy!

01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:58.968
Mummy, there's an enormous stickleback.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:05.720
- She is sweet.
- It's been such fun, Jim.

01:03:05.792 --> 01:03:07.593
Yes.

01:03:07.667 --> 01:03:09.302
Back tomorrow.

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:12.425
I wonder how much longer it'll last.

01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:25.551
Stands to reason, Rommel or no Rommel.
Attack Italy. That's what I say.

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:27.095
Only, let the Dogs do it.

01:03:27.167 --> 01:03:33.093
Leave it to the Guards, or the Greencoats,
or the Skirts, or the Umbrella Danglers,

01:03:33.167 --> 01:03:34.553
and it ain't worth doing.

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:37.635
But put the old Duke of Glendon's
Light Infantry...

01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:39.130
I daresay, I daresay.

01:03:39.208 --> 01:03:43.594
But the reason why we won't do it, is because
Rommel's going to be in Cairo by Christmas.

01:03:43.667 --> 01:03:48.171
In any case, Hitler intends to synchronise his
Egypt push with a blitzkrieg on Gibraltar.

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:50.218
He'll have to do more than that, eh, Dicky?

01:03:50.292 --> 01:03:53.136
It's all very well for you to laugh.
You'll see.

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:56.633
This time next year, we'll have
our back to the wall, and who's to blame?

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:58.711
The people at the top, what are they doing?

01:03:58.792 --> 01:04:01.423
Sitting back and doing nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.376
♪ If you were the only girl in the world

01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:17.420
♪ And I were the only boy

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:10.425
Are we all here?

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.550
- Come on, Macready.
- Sorry, sir.

01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:16.548
Well, I've called this meeting
because I've got some news for you.

01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:19.677
The information I have is security,

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.713
so I know I can depend on you
to keep your mouths shut about it.

01:05:22.792 --> 01:05:24.462
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

01:05:24.542 --> 01:05:28.251
I don't know very much about it myself,
but we're going abroad.

01:05:28.333 --> 01:05:31.842
The circumstances are rather unusual,
because, for security reasons,

01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:34.714
we're not getting ordinary
embarkation leave. Instead...

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:39.673
- Are they still there, Sergeant Major?
- I don't know.

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.251
It would be something
if we got our marching orders.

01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:44.885
Yes.

01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:49.296
The lads need it. They're fully trained
and fighting fit. They want action.

01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:51.010
I don't blame 'em.

01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:54.129
The papers may have forgotten
Greece and Crete, but I haven't.

01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:57.135
- What do you say?
- Yes, I reckon you've earned it all right.

01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:59.377
- Well, so have you.
- I'm getting on, Ned.

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:01.094
Mobile war's a young man's job.

01:06:01.167 --> 01:06:04.592
Office work's more in my line nowadays.
I can see it in the old man's eye.

01:06:04.667 --> 01:06:08.341
- Ah, you're kidding. Office work, you?
- Well, I've got plenty of it, ain't I?

01:06:08.417 --> 01:06:10.550
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:14.714
- Hello. I thought you'd be in the mess.
- No, sir. Just clearing up one or two things.

01:06:16.667 --> 01:06:18.800
Well, the Colonel's given
us some good news.

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:21.802
Oh, yes, sir? What er...
sort of good news, sir?

01:06:21.875 --> 01:06:25.004
We're going on a two months' course,
towards the end of October.

01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:28.876
- What er... kind of course, sir?
- Something new.

01:06:28.958 --> 01:06:33.177
- Must be. We've done nearly everything now.
- It's important. Leave's been put forward.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.802
I see, sir.

01:06:34.875 --> 01:06:37.885
Everybody has to have their seven days
by the end of September.

01:06:37.958 --> 01:06:41.965
Very well, sir. I'll see the sergeant major
in the morning about the leave roster.

01:06:43.042 --> 01:06:44.630
- Sergeant Fletcher?
- Yes, sir?

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:48.761
When you tell the men...
don't tell them what you're thinking.

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:51.168
- No, sir. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

01:06:52.417 --> 01:06:54.751
♪ And I was the only boy

01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:59.543
- Nothing like a good old sing-song.
- Horrible noise coming from somewhere.

01:06:59.625 --> 01:07:03.133
- I think it was Fletcher's lovely voice.
- It's this lot, harmonising.

01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:07.048
- I used to sing in a choir till my voice broke.
- Aw, then they called you up.

01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:10.005
- Just a moment.
- Ten minutes till lights out, Sergeant.

01:07:10.083 --> 01:07:12.003
All right, I haven't said a word, have I?

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:16.336
Now, listen. I've got
some good news for you.

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:22.171
In October, we're all going off on a
special course of two months' training.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:26.007
And I should say... it's
going to be very tiring.

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:28.715
So the CO has brought all
leave forward a bit.

01:07:28.792 --> 01:07:30.795
That's something, anyway.

01:07:30.875 --> 01:07:34.419
Well, I thought you'd like to know,
so that you can write home and so forth.

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:37.089
That's all.

01:07:37.167 --> 01:07:40.177
The new leave list will be out tomorrow.
Good night.

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:41.590
Good night, sarge.

01:07:41.667 --> 01:07:44.961
- We get our leave early, anyway.
- And the next later, don't forget.

01:07:45.042 --> 01:07:48.171
I wonder what it is.
We've done everything twice already.

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.758
Well, I can tell you what it is.
They've got no real fighting for us to do.

01:07:51.833 --> 01:07:54.511
So somebody says,
"What shall we do with the 9th Dogs?"

01:07:54.583 --> 01:07:58.885
Somebody else says, "Why not give them a bit
of training? That always keeps them quiet."

01:07:58.958 --> 01:08:00.759
Still, leave won't be so bad, will it?

01:08:00.833 --> 01:08:05.669
I read in the paper the other day that we're
not going to open a second front till 1947.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:08.511
If we don't get some action soon,
I want my cards back.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:10.338
Perhaps we're going to be paratroops.

01:08:10.417 --> 01:08:14.553
I'd like to see a battalion of motorised
infantry dropped by parachute.

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:18.546
- Who's room orderly tomorrow?
- I am.

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:21.719
Better clean out the inside of that stove.
It's full of fag ends.

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:22.881
OK.

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:27.759
I wonder why the sergeant was so pleased
with himself.

01:08:27.832 --> 01:08:29.883
He wants to get home to his wife.

01:08:30.957 --> 01:08:32.712
Yes, I suppose that's it.

01:08:32.792 --> 01:08:36.134
She has my sympathy.
Fancy seven whole days with him by numbers.

01:08:36.207 --> 01:08:40.131
It's a funny thing, but there was a time
when I couldn't imagine him having a wife.

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:43.383
Pity seven days is so short, eh?

01:08:46.625 --> 01:08:49.303
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Bill. You'll be back soon.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.010
That's right, Hilda.

01:08:54.375 --> 01:08:57.171
- Hello, Ted.
- Aye, aye.

01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:01.006
- Hello, Bert. Have a nice leave?
- Yes. Fine, thanks.

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:03.584
It's very nice of you
to come and see me off, Thyrtle.

01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:06.250
Pleasure, Davenport.
Pleased to have seen you again.

01:09:06.332 --> 01:09:08.881
Take your seats on the 10.40.

01:09:11.875 --> 01:09:15.667
- Hello, Luke. Have a good leave?
- Oh, grand, Sergeant, thanks.

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:17.800
- Will I take your coat?
- Thanks.

01:09:17.875 --> 01:09:19.629
- Well, goodbye, dear.
- Bye-bye.

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:22.754
Funny sort of war, isn't it?
Here one minute and gone the next.

01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:25.381
That's right. Is that Mr Perry over there?

01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:29.426
- Yes.
- Looks all right.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.585
Good as a regular... almost.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.792
Goodbye, dear.

01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:36.466
It's funny how much of our lives
we seem to spend on platforms.

01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:40.381
Yes, the amount of times we've said goodbye
on this one in the last three years...

01:09:40.457 --> 01:09:42.212
I wonder what we'll look like in 1970.

01:09:47.042 --> 01:09:48.464
Darling, don't wait.

01:09:48.542 --> 01:09:50.591
Jimmy,

01:09:50.667 --> 01:09:53.796
if you should ever go away
without saying goodbye to me...

01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:56.546
..I'd never forgive you, you know.

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:05.298
- You'd better get in, Geoff. We're due out.
- OK, Sid.

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:09.049
Now, don't forget. Any special thing
you want... It's your birthday soon.

01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:12.254
- I'll let you know, Dad.
- Bless you, son. Take care of yourself.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.543
I will.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.968
I won't wait.

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:28.134
Goodbye, darling. See you soon.
Don't be too easy with Phyllis.

01:10:29.542 --> 01:10:33.500
- Goodbye. Take care of yourself.
- I will. See you in a fortnight's time.

01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:35.135
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.

01:10:35.208 --> 01:10:37.377
- God bless you, dear.
- God bless.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.635
Blinds down!

01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:50.875
Goodbye!

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:15.845
She won't half be wild.
"See you in a fortnight," I said.

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:18.797
Don't worry, Ted.
We're going abroad to a nice warm climate.

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:20.464
I can taste the bananas already.

01:11:23.208 --> 01:11:24.630
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

01:11:24.708 --> 01:11:27.423
- Any idea where it is we're going?
- The rumour's Burma.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:30.215
- Jungle fighting.
- They say it takes a year to learn it.

01:11:30.292 --> 01:11:31.761
Oh, not our platoon, sir.

01:11:34.292 --> 01:11:36.544
Perhaps we're going for
a trip round the world.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:40.418
I don't care where we're going. I'm ready
for anywhere, except maybe Iceland.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.719
- We wouldn't go there with all this transport.
- They've made mistakes before now.

01:11:44.792 --> 01:11:47.044
Not that way. Put the ring over the hook.

01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:49.175
I wonder where we are going.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:50.720
Ssh! Listen.

01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:55.713
We're moving.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.754
One, two!

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:05.004
One, two!

01:12:06.125 --> 01:12:09.585
Deep! Get that lovely
fresh air in your lungs!

01:12:10.708 --> 01:12:12.628
Come on, Mr Perry. I can see you.

01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:14.758
Come on, sir. Come on.

01:12:14.833 --> 01:12:16.836
Steady! Break off!

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:20.295
It's going round the ship
that we passed Gibraltar during the night.

01:12:20.375 --> 01:12:22.343
- Is there any truth...?
- I have no idea.

01:12:22.417 --> 01:12:26.505
- I think I saw the outline of the Rock, sir.
- It was the shadow of that ship out there.

01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:29.428
I haven't heard anything.
When I do, I'll pass it on to you.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.005
Where do you think we are, Beck?

01:12:31.083 --> 01:12:34.757
Oh, I should say one...
no er... two days from the Cape, sir.

01:12:36.458 --> 01:12:37.928
All right, sit down.

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:41.960
Well, we've just had some very good news.

01:12:42.042 --> 01:12:46.000
Major Edwards is telling the rest of the
Company and I'm passing it on to you.

01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:50.006
The 8th Army have just won a big victory at
El Alamein and Rommel is in full retreat.

01:12:52.208 --> 01:12:54.377
Whoa! You haven't heard half of it yet.

01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:59.459
Now, we, in this convoy, are part of a big
invasion force, American as well as British,

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.924
that is going to French North Africa

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.876
to remove the enemy from there
and then cut Rommel's only line of retreat.

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:09.424
We land about 40 hours from now.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.843
I can't quite tell you where yet,
but I can tell you this.

01:13:12.917 --> 01:13:15.418
This is the first step
in the great offensive

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:19.636
that's going to make Hitler and Mussolini
put up the shutters and go out of business.

01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:25.211
Now, in the past,
we've all had our ups and downs,

01:13:25.292 --> 01:13:27.626
and many of us have been pretty fed up
at times.

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:30.091
Not people like Brewer and Davenport,
of course.

01:13:31.542 --> 01:13:34.090
However, that's all behind us now,

01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:39.251
and it looks as though all this training we did
is going to come in pretty handy after all.

01:13:39.333 --> 01:13:41.716
Now, I'll just give you what details I can.

01:13:50.667 --> 01:13:52.717
Now, if we land at Phillipville,

01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:55.754
there's a three-star hotel there
with an American bar

01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:57.836
which would doubtless have beer in stock.

01:13:57.917 --> 01:14:02.172
Those who prefer more exotic beverages
will find your curiosity amply satisfied

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:06.422
at the mysterious bazaars and coffeehouses
of the kasbah, or Muslim Quarter.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.669
They ought to make you a corporal for that.

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:12.886
We did a brochure on Algeria in '38. Of course,
it's not the kind of beer we're used to.

01:14:12.958 --> 01:14:16.088
He only started to drink ginger beer
before we left home.

01:14:16.167 --> 01:14:18.419
I can't see us having much time for beer.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:22.008
No, action, eh? With all this equipment.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:24.798
Yes, I shan't be sorry
when we get going with it.

01:14:26.083 --> 01:14:28.880
We won't half have something
to write home about now, eh?

01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:42.883
Jerries are round again.

01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:39.219
- What's that noise, mate? Guns?
- No, depth charges.

01:15:39.292 --> 01:15:42.302
I shouldn't let anyone
catch you smoking in here, if I were you.

01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:52.717
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

01:15:59.458 --> 01:16:01.508
- Good evening, sir.
- Brewer.

01:16:11.458 --> 01:16:13.508
- I'll be glad when...

01:16:40.083 --> 01:16:41.423
Stand still!

01:16:43.042 --> 01:16:45.092
Now, walk to your boat stations.

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:57.461
Do that up, Luke. Rifle, Sidley.
Fletcher, go to the boat station.

01:16:57.542 --> 01:16:59.794
No-one is to go near a
boat till they're told to.

01:16:59.875 --> 01:17:01.843
- All right here?
- What was it? Torpedo?

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:03.126
Yes, on the port side.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:07.047
Fire started in No.4 hold, sir.

01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:11.960
Get that hose along! And
tell the engineers!

01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:30.294
Clear that gear away from the bridge!

01:17:30.375 --> 01:17:32.378
- Hodges?
- Sir!

01:17:32.458 --> 01:17:33.631
- Woodward?
- Sergeant!

01:17:33.708 --> 01:17:34.834
Robinson?

01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:37.002
- Livingstone?
- Sir.

01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:39.715
Call the roll.

01:17:39.792 --> 01:17:41.877
- Stewart?
- Sir.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:43.594
- Jackson?
- Sir.

01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:45.504
- Peters?
- Sergeant.

01:17:48.083 --> 01:17:51.129
Get that hose over here!
That hose! Look out!

01:17:55.917 --> 01:17:58.761
- Are you all right over there?
- OK!

01:17:58.833 --> 01:18:00.220
Mr Mate!

01:18:00.292 --> 01:18:02.674
Yes. What is it?

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:06.045
The cargo's shifting!
Can I have some more hands below?

01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:07.298
Right!

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:10.835
- You fellows there, come with me.
- Leave your rifles here. Follow me.

01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:30.501
Bosun?

01:18:30.583 --> 01:18:32.551
Yes. What is it?

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.675
Starting on the upper twin deck.

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:36.469
Fire on the upper twin deck, sir.

01:18:36.542 --> 01:18:38.959
Get below.
Keep the magazine cool with the hoses.

01:18:39.042 --> 01:18:40.547
You, you three, go with him.

01:18:40.625 --> 01:18:44.631
The rest of you, lose as much weight as
possible from this side of the ship.

01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:48.845
- Start with this transport.
- Over the side with these trucks!

01:18:48.917 --> 01:18:52.425
Unship those rails!

01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:57.594
- Can't we get that stuff out of the magazine?
- 200 tons of it.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.715
Come on, get a bloody move on!

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:07.258
- All our new stuff, eh, sir?
- I know.

01:19:07.333 --> 01:19:09.004
Right, brake off!

01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:27.633
Take this rope! Make it fast there!

01:19:27.708 --> 01:19:32.010
Make it snappy!
Chuck that sling over them rails! Look out!

01:19:36.292 --> 01:19:38.342
Chuck that rope round the back of it!

01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:57.002
Now put a chock in front of that carrier.

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:59.964
Get another hose on that magazine!

01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:08.755
That magazine'll save us
the trouble in a minute!

01:20:21.958 --> 01:20:25.668
- Hold it! Hold it!
- She's going! She's going!

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.382
12 feet of water in No.4!

01:20:54.458 --> 01:20:56.544
No.5 bulkhead's bulging!

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:58.177
Brake off!

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:09.215
Bosun! How's it going? What's the position?

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:12.468
- I can't hold it any longer.
- Right, I'll tell the skipper.

01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:20.007
The fire's out of control down there!
We can't hold it any longer!

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:24.042
Right! Destroyer coming alongside!
Abandon ship!

01:21:25.333 --> 01:21:29.173
Abandon ship! Destroyer on starboard side!

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:31.965
Other side! Abandon ship!

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:50.295
That soldier there!

01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:19.545
Destroyer calling trooper,
am coming alongside.

01:22:19.625 --> 01:22:21.675
Get your men down as fast as you can.

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:24.885
Look out for my heaving lines.

01:22:29.875 --> 01:22:31.380
Let down your nets.

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:39.593
I'm sending some men aboard to help you.

01:22:41.083 --> 01:22:44.212
Come on down, mate.
Want to have a look at the bonfire?

01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:50.048
Don't look down, Bert.

01:22:56.083 --> 01:22:57.589
Keep clear of the nets.

01:23:11.375 --> 01:23:14.718
Take it easy, men. Don't rush. Don't rush.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.754
Get that rope!

01:23:31.417 --> 01:23:33.467
Round the wheel!

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.091
Luke!

01:23:53.375 --> 01:23:56.053
How many more men are there?
Time we were leaving.

01:24:04.375 --> 01:24:06.213
Right!

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:40.634
Come on, sir, it's time we were away.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:52.502
Get your nets adrift. Get down, men.

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:54.882
Keep your heads down.
She may go any minute.

01:25:22.292 --> 01:25:25.302
I knew we needn't have bothered
with them carriers.

01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:27.757
She might have gone up sooner if we hadn't.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.094
A nice lot of transport, that.
The best we've had.

01:25:32.167 --> 01:25:34.881
- All right here, boys?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

01:25:34.958 --> 01:25:36.547
How's the sergeant?

01:25:36.625 --> 01:25:39.920
The doctor says he'll be all
right in a week. He was lucky.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.133
What happened to your hand, Stainer?
A burn?

01:25:42.208 --> 01:25:44.009
It's just a graze, sir. It's nothing.

01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:47.213
- Take care of it. Have you got a dressing?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:47.292 --> 01:25:51.843
I expect the Colonel will be pretty disappointed
when he finds himself with only half a battalion.

01:25:51.917 --> 01:25:55.377
They can't start without us, though,
can they, sir?

01:25:55.458 --> 01:25:57.876
In this ship, we'll get there before them.

01:25:57.958 --> 01:26:00.175
Yes, that's right.

01:26:02.792 --> 01:26:05.470
I'm sorry, boys. I'm
afraid we're out of it.

01:26:06.542 --> 01:26:08.379
We're being taken back to Gibraltar.

01:26:13.458 --> 01:26:14.668
The Hampshire Regiment,

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:18.175
the Lincolnshire Regiment
and units of the Guards.

01:26:18.250 --> 01:26:20.300
I don't know.

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:23.255
They seem to have forgotten all about us,
they do.

01:26:23.333 --> 01:26:26.011
No wonder they've made
no progress in Tunisia.

01:26:26.083 --> 01:26:30.718
There's not a sign of the Dogs anywhere.
Not since Crete.

01:26:30.792 --> 01:26:33.754
Too many Guardsmen up the top,
that's the trouble.

01:26:33.833 --> 01:26:36.299
Still, the 8th Army ain't doing so bad.

01:26:36.375 --> 01:26:40.428
If the government only kept its eyes open
and put the Dogs in when there was trouble,

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:41.886
the war'd be over by now.

01:26:41.958 --> 01:26:44.044
It ain't the government's fault, Bobby.

01:26:44.125 --> 01:26:47.052
That's who I blame.
The government, the men at the top.

01:26:49.417 --> 01:26:51.799
I wonder what they have done with the Dogs.

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:03.002
What does your husband say, Mrs Brewer?

01:27:03.083 --> 01:27:05.133
He says things are still very dull.

01:27:05.208 --> 01:27:07.258
Well, they all say that, don't they?

01:27:07.333 --> 01:27:09.502
I don't care how dull it
is as long as he's safe.

01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:11.302
They're glad they've left the Rock.

01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:14.883
Of course, he couldn't say Gibraltar
because of the censor, but I know.

01:27:14.958 --> 01:27:17.885
They must be either in Algeria or Tunisia,
mustn't they?

01:27:17.958 --> 01:27:19.380
If only we knew.

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.461
- Perhaps it's better we don't know.
- Mm.

01:27:21.542 --> 01:27:24.339
Ted says there's a stripe
going, and old Perry...

01:27:24.417 --> 01:27:26.716
He says your husband's
certain to give it to him.

01:27:26.792 --> 01:27:29.091
You've no more recent news than that,
have you?

01:27:29.167 --> 01:27:32.959
Bill says something about a stripe, too.
He says he has a sporting chance.

01:27:33.042 --> 01:27:35.543
- I wonder whether you...
- I'm afraid I don't know.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.675
All Jim writes about are the flies.

01:28:37.208 --> 01:28:38.299
Where the hell are we?

01:28:38.375 --> 01:28:40.176
- You're driving.
- What a dump.

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:44.007
Not even a flick house with an army picture.
I'd hate to be an Arab in peacetime.

01:28:44.083 --> 01:28:45.423
How about them harems?

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.717
I haven't seen any yet. Nothing but flies.

01:28:53.958 --> 01:28:55.547
Talk about "the mysterious East".

01:28:55.625 --> 01:28:59.678
I reckon Lyons Corner House, Coventry Street's,
got more mystery than what this has.

01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:01.634
This isn't strictly speaking the East.

01:29:01.708 --> 01:29:02.799
What is it, then?

01:29:02.875 --> 01:29:05.838
You could call it the Middle East,
or the Near East, at a pinch.

01:29:05.917 --> 01:29:08.761
Heaven preserve us from the Far East,
that's what I say.

01:29:08.833 --> 01:29:12.626
Perry! That's your area over there.
By Rispoli's cafe.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.173
Right, sir.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:16.506
You come with me.

01:29:16.583 --> 01:29:17.756
Beck!

01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:31.506
Good afternoon.

01:29:31.583 --> 01:29:33.752
Beck, tell him that this
is the platoon area,

01:29:33.833 --> 01:29:36.417
and we hope he'll cooperate with us
while we're here.

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:41.086
Monsieur le Lieutenant dit qu'ici est le
centre de l'Arrondissement de notre platoon

01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:44.627
et qu'il invite votre coopération
pendant notre séjour.

01:29:44.708 --> 01:29:46.546
- Ah, oui!
- He laughs at the idea, sir.

01:29:46.625 --> 01:29:50.583
Tell him we're going to kick the Germans
out of his country. Maybe he'll like that.

01:29:50.667 --> 01:29:54.127
Monsieur le Lieutenant dit que nous voulons
vous désemparer des boches.

01:29:54.208 --> 01:29:57.633
- Et sûrement vous voulez la même chose.
- Je veux qu'on me fiche la paix.

01:29:57.708 --> 01:29:59.095
Says he's a pacifist, sir.

01:29:59.167 --> 01:30:03.255
Monsieur, il y a des batailles qui se déroulent
dans le nord et dans le sud et dans l'est.

01:30:03.333 --> 01:30:06.711
Ici, il n'y a rien. Allez là-bas
dans les grandes villes, à Sutre.

01:30:06.792 --> 01:30:09.636
Je n'ai pas le droit de vous permettre
de rester ici.

01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:13.715
Dites-lui, s'il veut des batailles,
que je peux lui donner des renseignements.

01:30:13.792 --> 01:30:18.426
He says to tell you, sir, that the fighting's in the
north, in the south, in the east, but not here.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:19.886
He's telling us.

01:30:19.958 --> 01:30:22.210
And that he cherishes the
peace in these parts.

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:25.136
He invites us to go to Sutre,
where there are many Germans.

01:30:25.208 --> 01:30:29.131
He says that Sutre's a bigger place than
this. That is a fact, incidentally, sir.

01:30:29.208 --> 01:30:31.294
If you wish, he can give
us an address or two.

01:30:31.375 --> 01:30:34.718
That's very cosy of him. Our orders
are to stay here, and here we stay.

01:30:34.792 --> 01:30:36.795
- Monsieur...
- Je déteste les soldats!

01:30:36.875 --> 01:30:38.594
Je déteste le bruit! Allez vous-en!

01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:40.835
He's not very fond of
noise, sir, or of troops.

01:30:40.917 --> 01:30:43.251
Repeats that he's a pacifist
and invites us to go.

01:30:43.333 --> 01:30:44.590
Allez, filez!

01:30:44.667 --> 01:30:47.712
- He says...
- I've got it. Sergeant Fletcher, we'll move in.

01:30:47.792 --> 01:30:49.261
Very good, sir.

01:31:00.708 --> 01:31:02.379
Rock, nothing but rock.

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:04.627
Fancy having to farm
this stuff, poor devils.

01:31:04.708 --> 01:31:08.501
- Well, it ain't exactly a picnic for us.
- Aye, but we haven't got to live here.

01:31:08.583 --> 01:31:10.717
Why should the enemy
want to take this place?

01:31:10.792 --> 01:31:13.174
No such luck. We won't
even see him from here.

01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:16.130
Now who's worrying?
It couldn't be you, could it, Brewer?

01:31:16.208 --> 01:31:19.503
No, sir, it's Luke here.
He's worrying about how the farmers get on.

01:31:19.583 --> 01:31:22.084
Let's hope we won't be here long enough
to find out.

01:31:22.167 --> 01:31:25.426
- Are we moving, sir?
- Not yet. That's what I'm here to tell you.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.420
- All here, Fletcher?
- Just coming, sir.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.918
At the double, there! Hurry up!

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.920
Are we going to have an ENSA concert, sir?

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.046
No, I think the concert parties
are a little further forward.

01:31:35.125 --> 01:31:36.879
- All here, Fletcher?
- Yes, sir.

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:40.170
I'll give you the full details later,
but the form is roughly this.

01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:42.668
Our battalion's in reserve
in these villages here,

01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:46.093
and a long way out in front,
our troops are in contact with the enemy.

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:48.300
You may see the German
Verey lights at night.

01:31:48.375 --> 01:31:50.259
Well, we're still a long way from them,

01:31:50.333 --> 01:31:53.545
but there's no reason why
we shouldn't keep on our toes, is there?

01:31:54.625 --> 01:31:56.344
Cheer up, Davenport. What's that?

01:31:56.417 --> 01:31:58.633
Some sort of tortoise, sir.

01:31:58.708 --> 01:32:01.340
There's a lot of them.
Some of the men keep them as pets.

01:32:01.417 --> 01:32:03.467
I'm glad somebody in the place is friendly.

01:32:03.542 --> 01:32:06.386
Now, this cafe.
The man there doesn't seem to like us much.

01:32:06.458 --> 01:32:09.220
He may improve with care,
so try not to break the place up,

01:32:09.292 --> 01:32:11.425
and be on your best behaviour, right?

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.750
- Right, sir.
- Very good, sir.

01:32:31.167 --> 01:32:33.419
Nice, friendly country, this.

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:34.840
Look at him. What's up?

01:32:34.917 --> 01:32:37.797
He hasn't read the Beveridge Report,
that's what's wrong.

01:32:37.875 --> 01:32:39.713
I haven't read it myself, come to that.

01:32:39.792 --> 01:32:42.470
He wanted us to leave him alone,
fight somewhere else.

01:32:42.542 --> 01:32:45.635
- I don't blame him. I don't blame us, either.
- Here.

01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:49.084
What about this? Couldn't we have a game?

01:32:49.167 --> 01:32:50.802
Go on, Sid, ask him.

01:32:50.875 --> 01:32:53.838
Ahem! Er... Monsieur le patron!

01:32:53.917 --> 01:32:58.302
Est-ce que vous serez très incommodé
si nous jouons un peu de darts?

01:33:03.208 --> 01:33:06.053
Vous avez de l'objection?

01:33:08.417 --> 01:33:10.052
Go on, put it up and play.

01:33:10.125 --> 01:33:12.673
Come on, Beck. It's time
to go and get orders.

01:33:15.208 --> 01:33:16.630
Och, come on.

01:33:21.167 --> 01:33:23.252
Cor! Look at that!

01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:24.755
Verey lights.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.384
I wonder if they're ours.

01:33:28.458 --> 01:33:30.259
Yeah.

01:33:31.333 --> 01:33:32.625
Pretty near, too.

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:35.344
Kind of creepy, isn't it?

01:33:36.792 --> 01:33:38.510
Come on.

01:33:41.458 --> 01:33:43.378
Nothing like it.

01:33:45.250 --> 01:33:47.300
21.

01:33:47.375 --> 01:33:49.425
39.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.338
Well done. 39.

01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:53.669
Ah, well, it's been a nice game, boys.

01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:55.172
Simple.

01:33:56.250 --> 01:33:57.885
We'll court the audience.

01:33:57.958 --> 01:33:59.084
9.

01:33:59.167 --> 01:34:00.885
Er... 21.

01:34:04.042 --> 01:34:06.507
- How do we stand, Bert?
- You're 19 down.

01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:08.918
- Hey, what's the idea?
- Go on, let him have a go.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.176
- Let him break up the game?
- It doesn't matter. Let him have a go.

01:34:16.708 --> 01:34:20.667
Look, he's taking cover.
Thinks it's a spear.

01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:25.170
Very good! Very good!

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:28.593
Sacré crétin!
Tu veux voir ma maison en ruines?

01:34:28.667 --> 01:34:31.961
Idiot, espèce d'andouille... Un grand trou.

01:34:33.083 --> 01:34:35.133
Méchant.

01:34:50.167 --> 01:34:52.383
- Well played, sir!
- Beautifully played!

01:34:52.458 --> 01:34:54.876
- Why can't you play like that?
- Beginner's luck.

01:34:54.958 --> 01:34:58.336
Vous voyez, il n'est pas nécessaire
de désacrer les maisons d'autres.

01:34:58.417 --> 01:35:00.669
Allez, filez, filez!
C'est très désagréable!

01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:06.095
Et vous, vous vous conduisez comme ça devant
les Anglais... Une honte! C'est terrible, ça!

01:35:09.958 --> 01:35:11.131
Continuez.

01:35:19.375 --> 01:35:23.926
- Come on, George! Come on!
- You can do it easily. That's the stuff.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.880
Not bad, eh?
Here, now what you want is double two.

01:35:26.958 --> 01:35:29.175
- Two, two.
- Two, two.

01:35:31.042 --> 01:35:32.677
- Good job!
- Oh, beautiful, eh?

01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:36.009
What about beginner's luck?
He's played like this for three weeks.

01:35:36.083 --> 01:35:37.553
All right, all right.

01:35:37.625 --> 01:35:40.635
- What's the lecture today, sarge?
- Aircraft recognition.

01:35:40.708 --> 01:35:43.589
..has been as fine
as anywhere in England.

01:35:43.667 --> 01:35:46.547
Yes, it's been a good year all round
in Berkshire.

01:35:46.625 --> 01:35:49.801
The potatoes and sugar beet
look like coming on nicely.

01:35:49.875 --> 01:35:52.885
And other crops are also satisfactory.

01:35:52.958 --> 01:35:58.719
Of course, Michaelmas has been considered for
ages the termination of the farmers' year.

01:35:58.792 --> 01:36:00.297
But things have altered.

01:36:00.375 --> 01:36:04.843
Thousands of boys and girls on holiday from
school have been helping in the fields,

01:36:04.917 --> 01:36:08.128
and working like Trojans
in the harvest camps.

01:36:09.292 --> 01:36:12.551
It warms a farmer's heart
to see a thing like I saw last week

01:36:12.625 --> 01:36:14.675
in the village of Redshaw-by-Farrow.

01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:18.045
A little girl,
she couldn't have been older than five...

01:36:18.125 --> 01:36:20.294
Switch it off. Platoon, 'shun!

01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:24.543
All right, sit down. Smoke if you want to.

01:36:27.458 --> 01:36:28.880
Afternoon.

01:36:32.292 --> 01:36:35.882
I had hoped that we would have seen
rather more enemy aircraft round here,

01:36:35.958 --> 01:36:40.047
so you could have kept up with your aircraft
recognition without using these models.

01:36:40.125 --> 01:36:44.048
However, all we have seen is a couple of
dreary-looking reconnaissance planes,

01:36:44.125 --> 01:36:48.001
so we'll run through the German types,
to make sure you haven't forgotten them.

01:36:48.083 --> 01:36:50.086
We'll start off with a few questions.

01:36:50.167 --> 01:36:52.798
What's this one? Davenport?

01:36:52.875 --> 01:36:55.008
- Messerschmitt 109F, sir.
- That's right.

01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:57.963
This one? Luke?

01:36:58.042 --> 01:36:59.713
- Stuka, sir.
- That's right.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.678
- Brewer?
- Focke-Wulf 190, sir.

01:37:06.167 --> 01:37:08.668
- Stainer?
- Lysander, sir.

01:37:10.708 --> 01:37:14.299
Parsons, what's the difference between
a Lysander and a Henschel 126?

01:37:14.375 --> 01:37:16.343
The wings of the Henschel are swept back,

01:37:16.417 --> 01:37:19.131
and on the Lizzy
they look as if they're swept forward.

01:37:26.708 --> 01:37:29.505
- Steiner, have you got that machine of yours?
- Yes, sir.

01:37:29.583 --> 01:37:33.127
Well, play it. And the rest of
you, for heaven's sake, sing.

01:37:36.375 --> 01:37:38.425
♪ Lily Of Laguna

01:37:48.750 --> 01:37:51.630

01:39:15.542 --> 01:39:17.592
I wonder what's up.

01:39:17.667 --> 01:39:20.168
One hour's notice and then stand-to.

01:39:21.667 --> 01:39:23.089
Look at it now.

01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:28.251
I suppose that's what the
papers call an inferno.

01:39:29.917 --> 01:39:31.754
How many magazines have you got?

01:39:47.792 --> 01:39:50.719
The Jerries have attacked
and broken through up forward.

01:39:56.417 --> 01:39:57.922
- All right here?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:08.171
- Lummy, I could do with a fag.
- Ssh!

01:40:58.375 --> 01:40:59.761
I say, Corporal?

01:40:59.833 --> 01:41:01.801
Quiet, Beck.

01:41:22.708 --> 01:41:23.918
Thank you.

01:42:01.417 --> 01:42:03.088
Watch your front!

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:07.427
Watch your front!

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:13.129
Listen. What's that?

01:42:18.167 --> 01:42:20.335
- Sergeant Fletcher?
- Sir?

01:42:22.875 --> 01:42:25.044
Do you hear that?

01:42:25.125 --> 01:42:26.547
Tanks.

01:42:26.625 --> 01:42:28.959
I'll go over and have a
look at that section.

01:42:45.167 --> 01:42:46.719
Here they come.

01:42:51.042 --> 01:42:53.803
Section! Enemy in front!

01:42:55.875 --> 01:42:57.594
Rapid!

01:43:05.208 --> 01:43:06.844
Come on, come on.

01:43:09.042 --> 01:43:10.428
Fire!

01:43:20.833 --> 01:43:22.006
Change!

01:43:42.208 --> 01:43:44.046
- Your men all right?
- Yes, fine, sir.

01:43:44.125 --> 01:43:45.216
Good. Listen.

01:43:45.292 --> 01:43:49.380
They've broken through behind B Company
and we've been ordered back to the village.

01:44:04.125 --> 01:44:05.926
- Maria, aux caves!
- Mais...

01:44:06.001 --> 01:44:07.127
C'est un ordre!

01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:22.333
Ça y est! Ça y est! Au secours!

01:44:27.833 --> 01:44:30.050
At the double! Davenport, Luke, over here!

01:44:55.208 --> 01:44:56.250
Mortar.

01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:03.467
- Where the hell is it? Can you see it?
- No, sir.

01:45:03.542 --> 01:45:05.461
Let's try down below.

01:45:15.875 --> 01:45:17.261
I think I've spotted it!

01:45:17.334 --> 01:45:21.672
- Where?
- There! Firing from behind that wall.

01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:39.220
Follow me, Beck.

01:45:40.334 --> 01:45:41.756
Brewer, come on.

01:45:46.292 --> 01:45:48.129
Come on, Fletcher! Luke! This way!

01:45:56.833 --> 01:46:01.468
Fletcher, see that six-pounder across the
street? I'm going to try and get it working.

01:46:01.542 --> 01:46:03.545
Luke and Brewer will come with me as cover.

01:46:03.625 --> 01:46:07.252
- I want you too, Beck. You take over.
- Very good, sir.

01:46:09.208 --> 01:46:13.131
- Now, across the street... and run like hell.
- Good luck, chaps.

01:46:19.334 --> 01:46:22.677
See that Vickers? Take it into
Rispoli's and cover us from there.

01:46:22.750 --> 01:46:26.175
If we keep their heads down on that hill
it will be all right. Go on.

01:46:46.125 --> 01:46:48.970
- Venez donc!
- Non, laissez-moi!

01:47:00.708 --> 01:47:02.297
Now, Beck.

01:47:33.208 --> 01:47:35.591
What's the matter with it, Luke?

01:47:36.668 --> 01:47:38.552
Dry. Bone dry.

01:47:38.625 --> 01:47:40.628
And ruddy hot!

01:47:41.708 --> 01:47:44.802
Pass auf! Pass auf!

01:47:48.458 --> 01:47:49.928
Da!

01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:52.923
Come on!

01:47:56.792 --> 01:47:59.423
- Look who's here.
- Attendez! Attendez!

01:48:06.125 --> 01:48:07.251
Down!

01:48:12.167 --> 01:48:15.094
- Ça va aller.
- Here.

01:48:57.001 --> 01:48:58.423
Right, Beck.

01:49:11.708 --> 01:49:13.379
That's the last one, sir.

01:49:22.917 --> 01:49:24.339
One of them gone, anyway.

01:49:30.417 --> 01:49:32.882
- Are you both all right?
- Right, sir!

01:49:32.958 --> 01:49:34.961
Well, come on back with me, quick!

01:50:01.042 --> 01:50:04.336
- Check the ammunition, Lloyd.
- Yes, sir.

01:50:04.417 --> 01:50:07.510
- What have you got, Geoff?
- Four magazines and a bit.

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:11.380
- Luke, how much ammo?
- About 25 rounds.

01:50:11.458 --> 01:50:14.469
- Ted?
- About 20.

01:50:14.542 --> 01:50:16.924
- Davenport?
- Only about ten.

01:50:17.001 --> 01:50:19.051
- Beck?
- About 20.

01:50:19.125 --> 01:50:21.803
Four magazines
and about 20 rounds a man, sir.

01:50:21.875 --> 01:50:23.759
Right, well, go easy on it.

01:50:25.292 --> 01:50:26.963
Something happening over there!

01:50:30.958 --> 01:50:34.798
They've surrendered! Gosh, I didn't
think it would be as easy as that.

01:50:34.875 --> 01:50:36.843
It may be a trick.

01:50:36.917 --> 01:50:38.173
Listen.

01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:44.834
If you resist us more,
you will be destroyed completely!

01:50:44.917 --> 01:50:46.967
If you lay down your arms,

01:50:47.042 --> 01:50:51.842
we promise you good treatment and food!

01:50:51.917 --> 01:50:54.050
Who the hell does he think he's talking to?

01:50:54.125 --> 01:50:55.879
- Yeah, that's right.
- What a nerve!

01:50:55.958 --> 01:50:58.424
I await your immediate reply!

01:50:58.500 --> 01:50:59.922
I'd like to take a pot at him.

01:51:00.001 --> 01:51:02.467
Beck, tell him in German to go to hell.

01:51:03.792 --> 01:51:05.297
Can you hear me?

01:51:05.375 --> 01:51:08.220
Yes! Your answer, quick!

01:51:08.292 --> 01:51:11.717
Wollen Sie so gut sein in Dei...

01:51:12.833 --> 01:51:13.876
In Dei...

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:18.628
Sorry, sir, I've forgotten the German for
hell. I've never had to use it much.

01:51:18.708 --> 01:51:20.048
He knows English.

01:51:20.125 --> 01:51:22.093
Go to hell!

01:51:23.208 --> 01:51:25.674
- Everybody OK?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:27.670
Feeling a bit hungry, sir.

01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:29.883
Breakfast may be a little
late this morning.

01:51:29.958 --> 01:51:32.257
All right, Brewer? Plenty to grumble about?

01:51:32.334 --> 01:51:35.049
- Yes, thank you, sir.
- Good.

01:51:50.292 --> 01:51:52.674
Jimmy, this is what we're going to do.

01:51:58.958 --> 01:52:00.168
- Is that clear?
- Right.

01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:03.841
Lloyd! Lloyd, we're going in!
Start from here when the smoke comes down!

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:05.339
- Did you get that?
- Yes, sir.

01:52:05.417 --> 01:52:07.088
I'll go and see the other sections.

01:52:20.542 --> 01:52:21.928
Here it is.

01:52:40.792 --> 01:52:43.257
I'm sorry I forgot the
German for hell, sir.

01:52:44.583 --> 01:52:46.633
It's Hölle.

01:52:46.708 --> 01:52:48.758
That's all right, Beck.

01:52:57.208 --> 01:52:58.500
Come on, lads.

01:52:58.583 --> 01:53:00.966
Once more for the day
you missed on the exercise.
