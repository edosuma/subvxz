00:00.568 --> 00:03.488
It won't be easy carrying
your dead child to term.

00:03.825 --> 00:06.224
I have to tell James.

00:06.225 --> 00:10.104
I'm just terrified
that I'll lose him.

00:10.105 --> 00:12.704
Don't tell him, not yet.
But I...

00:12.705 --> 00:14.184
I've had a thought.

00:14.185 --> 00:16.024
Say nothing until we've spoken.

00:17.065 --> 00:18.704
Sarah and I won't
be returning with you.

00:18.705 --> 00:22.104
I thought we'd stay in town for
the night to celebrate her success.

00:22.105 --> 00:26.464
Your brother and Mr James...

00:26.465 --> 00:29.584
How is the unfortunate matter
proceeding?

00:29.585 --> 00:32.464
You're sure?
Absolutely.

00:32.465 --> 00:36.264
You'd have known last week if George
hadn't forbidden communication.

00:36.265 --> 00:38.464
And she has no idea?

00:38.465 --> 00:41.745
Isn't it delicious? You've won.

00:44.386 --> 00:50.905

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

00:50.945 --> 00:52.984
I thought
you'd be cock-a-hoop.

00:52.985 --> 00:57.744
I wanted something
that would prove her unfit.

00:57.745 --> 00:59.984
This simply proves her unavailable.

00:59.985 --> 01:01.904
Well, it still sees her gone.

01:01.905 --> 01:06.304
And me far less forgivable.

01:06.305 --> 01:08.664
Perhaps if the news came from you...

01:08.665 --> 01:10.264
I think not.

01:10.265 --> 01:13.784
Well, it's your discovery.
Made on your instructions.

01:13.785 --> 01:17.665
No, I need to be in a position
to pick up the pieces.

01:18.665 --> 01:20.185
He'll forgive you.

01:21.785 --> 01:23.265
Eventually.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.104
As for your being here,

01:26.105 --> 01:28.944
I would rather you leave
once the news is broken.

01:28.945 --> 01:30.704
We struck a deal, remember?

01:30.705 --> 01:32.984
Which I shall honour in due course.

01:32.985 --> 01:35.664
No, you won't, unless you have to.
We both know that.

01:35.665 --> 01:37.304
You'll stay or go as I see fit.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.304
I hope you don't mind if we...

01:39.305 --> 01:43.025
Oh, Reggie!
Surprise, my darling.

01:44.025 --> 01:47.424
Welcome home.
It's marvellous to be home.

01:47.425 --> 01:49.944
Well, we were thinking
of having supper in our room,

01:49.945 --> 01:51.504
but since you're here
I think that...

01:51.505 --> 01:54.304
Oh, please, no fuss, no fuss.
I'm here to stay.

01:54.305 --> 01:56.024
We've plenty of time to catch up.

01:56.025 --> 01:57.704
Nonsense. Grandmother?

01:57.705 --> 02:00.824
Oh, it's been a long day.
We'll talk at breakfast.

02:00.825 --> 02:03.864
Please give my best to Olivia.

02:03.865 --> 02:05.545
I'll see you at breakfast.

02:11.145 --> 02:14.464
James has been getting up to
all sorts of mischief, I hear,

02:14.465 --> 02:16.105
with Amy's brother.

02:17.185 --> 02:18.985
She was most forthcoming.

02:20.185 --> 02:23.745
No, I think you'll
need me here for support.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074

03:00.065 --> 03:02.824
Reggie's back. She's downstairs.

03:02.825 --> 03:05.424
I thought she'd planned
to be away for months.

03:05.425 --> 03:07.424
So did I.

03:07.425 --> 03:11.544
I suspect Grandmother's venting
her spleen about the party.

03:11.545 --> 03:13.904
I was shooed away.

03:13.905 --> 03:17.144
But at least we enjoyed ourselves,

03:17.145 --> 03:21.104
despite your being monopolised
by Andrew Swanson.

03:21.105 --> 03:23.144
He was simply being friendly.

03:23.145 --> 03:26.944
Yes, he was, to you more than most.

03:26.945 --> 03:31.224
James, he feels he can talk to me.

03:31.225 --> 03:35.144
We should invite him
down again. Soon.

03:35.145 --> 03:39.385
Not too soon, and certainly not
while Anna's still here.

03:43.945 --> 03:46.064
Amy, may I have a word, please?

03:46.065 --> 03:48.665
Colleen, will you take the laundry?

03:53.545 --> 03:56.505
This is not a pleasant task for me.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.704
You've been indiscreet.

03:59.705 --> 04:02.424
Oh, Mrs Standish said she knew.

04:02.425 --> 04:04.144
She only suspected.

04:04.145 --> 04:07.264
Unfortunately you have
confirmed those suspicions,

04:07.265 --> 04:09.824
which puts me in
a very delicate position.

04:09.825 --> 04:12.984
I would never do wrong by you
or Mr James, not deliberately.

04:12.985 --> 04:17.543
I know, but I cannot risk
a similar occurrence.

04:17.545 --> 04:20.225
Oh, but...

04:25.345 --> 04:29.104
Ma'am, I miss my sister
and I do remind Mr James...

04:29.105 --> 04:31.184
Yes.

04:31.185 --> 04:33.504
So...

04:33.505 --> 04:35.305
..I think perhaps I should go.

04:36.745 --> 04:40.745
A wise choice. Thank you.

04:41.705 --> 04:44.304
Three months' salary
and a fine recommendation

04:44.305 --> 04:46.184
will be ready for you
within the hour.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.224
Norman will drive you
wherever you wish to go.

04:49.225 --> 04:51.104
I see no point in delaying matters.

04:51.105 --> 04:52.945
Oh, no.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.825
You go with my blessing.

04:57.025 --> 04:59.465
Ma'am, I understand.

05:08.065 --> 05:09.665
Oh...

05:18.145 --> 05:19.665
Ohh...

05:23.705 --> 05:26.865
That's what I thought
we might have lost.

06:17.425 --> 06:19.624
Good morning, Colleen.
Morning, sir.

06:19.625 --> 06:23.585
Where's Amy?
Uh, best ask Mrs Bligh.

06:29.785 --> 06:31.504
Amy's gone.

06:31.505 --> 06:33.584
Oh, apparently
her sister needed her.

06:33.585 --> 06:36.224
We have more pressing matters,
George. Will you sit?

06:36.225 --> 06:37.944
Before you continue, the party

06:37.945 --> 06:39.704
must have dispelled
your doubts about Sarah.

06:39.705 --> 06:41.224
This three-month trial nonsense...

06:41.225 --> 06:43.304
That's something of a moot point
now. Will you sit?

06:43.305 --> 06:46.585
Mother!
George, this is important. Please.

06:52.705 --> 06:54.544
Regina returned last night...

06:54.545 --> 06:57.025
..with information.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.504
Oh, this honestly
brings me no pleasure.

07:00.505 --> 07:02.984
Mother, there's nothing
you can tell me about Sarah

07:02.985 --> 07:04.464
that's worse than I already know.

07:04.465 --> 07:05.945
I'm afraid there is.

07:08.305 --> 07:10.945
This is something
you couldn't possibly know.

07:11.905 --> 07:14.025
Miss Adams doesn't
even know it herself.

07:16.545 --> 07:18.784
Thank you for the bed.

07:18.785 --> 07:21.225
Any time, my darling.

07:26.585 --> 07:28.545
Father.

07:30.425 --> 07:32.145
George!

07:35.385 --> 07:37.505
George!

07:42.905 --> 07:44.904
What's happened?

07:44.905 --> 07:46.624
It doesn't concern either of you.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.105
Not yet.

07:55.065 --> 07:56.545
Hello!

08:01.865 --> 08:03.665
What?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.984
Regina's back.

08:06.985 --> 08:08.544
What has she said?

08:08.545 --> 08:10.584
Mother swears it's true.

08:10.585 --> 08:12.064
George?

08:12.065 --> 08:14.344
She says there's proof.

08:14.345 --> 08:16.225
Of what?

08:17.545 --> 08:19.985
They say your husband's alive.

08:29.825 --> 08:33.183
Ah, my least favourite Bligh.

08:33.184 --> 08:34.744
Regina.

08:34.745 --> 08:37.583
Elizabeth mentioned
you'd relocated.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.864
Did you run out of men in the city?

08:39.865 --> 08:42.104
I came for the country air.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.625
Oh, it's a lot less fresh suddenly.

08:47.145 --> 08:48.864
What have you done?

08:48.865 --> 08:51.385
Saved George
from becoming a bigamist.

08:52.585 --> 08:55.624
Mrs Bligh is asking for you, ma'am.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.745
That's my cue.

09:05.865 --> 09:07.984
Miss Adams
has come for clarification.

09:07.985 --> 09:10.184
I told you that
if you caused any trouble...

09:10.185 --> 09:12.504
If you must shoot the messenger,
George, you must,

09:12.505 --> 09:15.224
but I do hope
you understand in time.

09:15.225 --> 09:16.864
I hope we can do this
without rancour.

09:16.865 --> 09:18.345
Tell me.

09:19.345 --> 09:22.665
I do regret having to do this.
Now!

09:23.665 --> 09:25.704
Given Elizabeth's concerns,

09:25.705 --> 09:28.664
I employed inquiry agents
throughout Europe.

09:28.665 --> 09:31.384
I discovered a number
of disturbing facts -

09:31.385 --> 09:36.144
facts it seems George is aware of,
so we won't even discuss them.

09:36.145 --> 09:37.864
Everything changed, however,

09:37.865 --> 09:40.904
when my man visited
your sister-in-law in Paris.

09:40.905 --> 09:44.864
He sensed an unease when he
questioned her about your marriage.

09:44.865 --> 09:47.384
He dug deeper
and imagine what he found.

09:47.385 --> 09:49.984
Regina.

09:49.985 --> 09:51.865
I apologise.

09:52.865 --> 09:55.704
Madame Duval spends much time
with her invalid brother,

09:55.705 --> 09:59.744
recently discovered alive
in a Jewish repatriation hospital.

09:59.745 --> 10:03.104
The whys and wherefores
of his survival are unclear,

10:03.105 --> 10:05.144
but he was recognised
by a former colleague

10:05.145 --> 10:06.945
who joined the medical staff.

10:07.985 --> 10:12.105
For eight years,
he was a brain-damaged John Doe.

10:13.385 --> 10:18.425
A photograph taken by my man
a week ago.

10:33.665 --> 10:35.505
Yes.

10:37.025 --> 10:39.025
It is him.

10:41.905 --> 10:44.344
Oh, dear God.

10:44.345 --> 10:46.265
Sarah...

10:56.825 --> 10:59.264
Would you mind
waiting outside, please?

10:59.265 --> 11:01.225
Of course.
Thank you.

11:30.465 --> 11:32.705
It's not fair for George
to have to hear this.

11:38.625 --> 11:41.105
Rene was the love of my life.

11:42.905 --> 11:47.225
For some reason, his sister
chose not to tell me he's alive.

11:48.385 --> 11:50.945
Whatever your motives...

11:52.305 --> 11:54.185
..thank you.

11:55.985 --> 11:58.064
Without you, I may never have known.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.025
So noble...
Enough!

12:03.585 --> 12:06.025
Miss Adams, I...

12:07.465 --> 12:09.705
..I wish you well.

12:18.065 --> 12:19.665
Goodbye, Mrs Bligh.

12:26.185 --> 12:29.065
What a sad and pathetic
creature you are.

12:30.425 --> 12:32.625
Not a word.

12:48.305 --> 12:50.065
I must go to him.

12:51.265 --> 12:53.624
I know what he meant to you.

12:53.625 --> 12:57.864
I know... I know what you
went through to survive for him.

12:57.865 --> 13:00.584
I have to tell Jack
and move my things to Roy's.

13:00.585 --> 13:02.064
I'll see to that.

13:02.065 --> 13:04.064
I'll take the train
tomorrow to the city

13:04.065 --> 13:05.864
and stay with Aunt Peg
until I leave.

13:05.865 --> 13:07.344
You have to go by aeroplane.

13:07.345 --> 13:10.144
You need to get there as soon
as possible. I will cover the cost.

13:10.145 --> 13:11.985
You can't.
I can.

13:13.225 --> 13:16.345
Whatever's needed to ease your way.

13:18.905 --> 13:23.024
I'd fight if there was a point,
but there's not.

13:23.025 --> 13:27.025
I know you. He's your husband.

13:28.185 --> 13:30.705
I don't know what I'll find there.

13:32.665 --> 13:35.625
You will be true
to whatever you find there.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.625
That's who you are.

13:42.225 --> 13:44.705
My darling...

13:50.374 --> 13:53.165
Amy left, but I doubt
it's connected to that.

13:53.184 --> 13:55.194
So nothing else
out of the ordinary has happened?

13:55.196 --> 13:57.355
Just Reggie arriving.
What happened at the party?

13:57.356 --> 13:59.915
Father was over the moon.
Sarah carried the day.

13:59.916 --> 14:02.955
Go and see if you can get any more
out of Grandmother than we could.

14:02.956 --> 14:05.596
Anna, I'm sure
we'll know soon enough.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.795
Andrew sent his best wishes,
by the way.

14:09.796 --> 14:13.035
You wouldn't mind if we had him
down again, would you?

14:13.036 --> 14:16.395
Livvy...
He's quite moved on.

14:16.396 --> 14:18.755
Of course I mind.

14:18.756 --> 14:24.716
If Grandmother's done anything to
hurt them I will never forgive her.

14:33.196 --> 14:34.836
George.

14:36.156 --> 14:37.796
What's happened?

14:41.556 --> 14:43.236
Oh...

14:47.676 --> 14:49.155
Right.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.875
I apologise
for leaving you in the lurch.

14:51.876 --> 14:54.716
Well, you've got to go.
Of course you do.

14:56.116 --> 14:57.675
Will you be back?

14:57.676 --> 14:59.316
I don't know.

15:01.396 --> 15:03.156
You never spoke of him much.

15:04.876 --> 15:08.956
It's taken eight years
to hear the words I prayed for.

15:10.036 --> 15:12.276
Well, if it makes you glad,
I'm glad.

15:13.756 --> 15:15.355
How did they get it so wrong?

15:15.356 --> 15:17.035
I really don't know.

15:17.036 --> 15:19.675
Um, I'll come back tomorrow
for goodbyes.

15:19.676 --> 15:21.556
I can't face everyone now.

16:36.316 --> 16:38.075
Colleen will take that.

16:38.076 --> 16:40.355
I feel like some air.

16:40.356 --> 16:42.356
I won't be long.

16:59.516 --> 17:03.675
I'd like to place a long-distance
call to a Sydney number, thank you.

17:03.676 --> 17:05.234
Excuse me.

17:05.236 --> 17:07.994
Sir, Mrs Bligh is on the telephone.
She says it's important.

17:07.996 --> 17:10.635
Elizabeth Bligh?
Mrs James Bligh, ma'am.

17:10.636 --> 17:12.435
Thank you.

17:13.435 --> 17:15.796
I'm simply being a friend.

17:23.915 --> 17:25.474
Hello.

17:25.476 --> 17:28.115
I'm so sorry
to interrupt your dinner.

17:28.116 --> 17:31.755
It's the only time I can telephone
without being noticed.

17:31.756 --> 17:34.155
What you said as we left the party...

17:34.156 --> 17:37.915
We shouldn't discuss this
on the telephone. We should meet.

17:37.916 --> 17:40.235
How can you possibly help?

17:40.236 --> 17:42.395
If you have the courage
for the solution

17:42.396 --> 17:44.276
I can solve your problem.

17:45.276 --> 17:47.915
You can't really come here,
I'm afraid,

17:47.916 --> 17:50.235
but I may have
a good excuse to get away.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.315
Let me know once you've arrived.

17:52.316 --> 17:54.836
I have to go.

18:10.956 --> 18:13.756
It's so tense downstairs.

18:15.556 --> 18:18.315
James, I'm feeling
awfully uncomfortable

18:18.316 --> 18:21.276
being caught up
in the middle of all of this.

18:23.276 --> 18:26.716
Would you mind if I went
to stay in the city?

19:57.556 --> 19:59.555
Thanks.

19:59.556 --> 20:01.555
You get to bed at all?

20:01.556 --> 20:04.036
Oh, I dozed here on and off.

20:05.036 --> 20:06.555
You had a visitor.

20:06.556 --> 20:08.955
George?

20:08.956 --> 20:11.315
You were sleeping.

20:11.316 --> 20:13.716
I don't think he knew what to say.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.115
I wish he'd woken me.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.675
How do you wanna get through today?

20:19.676 --> 20:25.115
Uh, I want to say goodbye
to my patients and the staff.

20:25.116 --> 20:27.515
I could whip you round
in the truck if you'd like.

20:27.516 --> 20:32.476
Thanks. I'll take a late train,
make arrangements from Peg's.

20:33.476 --> 20:36.475
You gonna give old Ma Bligh
a serve before you go?

20:36.476 --> 20:40.636
Whatever pain she's caused,
she's given me something
extraordinary.

20:43.036 --> 20:45.395
I should've felt him alive.
I should've known.

20:45.396 --> 20:47.356
That's enough of that.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.315
Lady Muck or not,

20:51.316 --> 20:53.755
that old girl's gonna get
the sharp edge of my tongue

20:53.756 --> 20:56.515
the next time I see her.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.836
Watch yourself.

20:59.836 --> 21:03.035
Father! Would you like
some company?

21:03.036 --> 21:04.555
Not really. I'm sorry.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.395
Are you going to see Sarah?
Later.

21:06.396 --> 21:08.755
Don't you want to spend as much time
with her as possible?

21:08.756 --> 21:11.395
I want to spend the rest
of my life with her. I can't.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.035
It might not work out
with her husband.

21:13.036 --> 21:15.675
It won't be for want of her trying.
You've gotta fight for her.

21:15.676 --> 21:17.115
Anna!

21:17.116 --> 21:20.476
Alright, I'll stay out of it.

21:21.476 --> 21:24.275
If I know Sarah, she won't leave
without saying goodbye.

21:24.276 --> 21:25.955
Let her come to you.

21:25.956 --> 21:27.676
If there's anything I can do...

21:29.996 --> 21:32.596
Your offering means the world.

21:53.756 --> 21:56.315
It seems the family's
choosing to avoid us.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.835
Hardly surprising.

21:58.836 --> 22:01.595
I'd hoped to see George
before I left.

22:01.596 --> 22:03.355
I've decided you're right.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.755
A discreet withdrawal now
will bear fruit later.

22:05.756 --> 22:09.035
Well, that would be
the decent course of action.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.315
Any indecencies I show
come from your desire

22:11.316 --> 22:14.115
to renege on our arrangement.

22:14.116 --> 22:16.355
I will return.

22:16.356 --> 22:18.515
I hate you both.

22:18.516 --> 22:22.035
No-one would ever had known
if you two hadn't gone poking
around.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.675
I did what I thought
was best, darling.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.875
Would you rather your father
had become a bigamist, Anna?

22:25.876 --> 22:28.475
What if it had come out
after the wedding?

22:28.476 --> 22:30.915
Gino and I have set the date
of our wedding.

22:30.916 --> 22:34.875
It's in six weeks
in the Catholic church.

22:34.876 --> 22:38.196
And you... are not invited.

22:42.116 --> 22:43.756
Fiery.

22:46.396 --> 22:48.436
Tedious.

22:53.556 --> 22:55.716
My dear friend.

22:56.676 --> 23:00.436
You write.
I reckon I won't.

23:01.436 --> 23:03.475
I'm not sure if this is
the right time,

23:03.476 --> 23:07.355
but, uh, I'd like you to know
Carolyn and I...

23:07.356 --> 23:09.235
Yes?

23:09.236 --> 23:10.715
Yeah.

23:10.716 --> 23:14.796
That's the nicest farewell gift
I could imagine.

23:16.516 --> 23:19.395
You ready to face Doris?

23:19.396 --> 23:21.716
As I'll ever be.

23:24.996 --> 23:27.995
Miss Adams, Miss Adams,
when Alma told me you were leaving

23:27.996 --> 23:29.995
I said, "No, dear,
that's quite impossible.

23:29.996 --> 23:31.555
"Miss Adams is one of us."

23:31.556 --> 23:33.795
But she left me with no choice
but to believe.

23:33.796 --> 23:38.075
Your husband, I hear, alive?
Yes.

23:38.076 --> 23:42.395
I mean no disrespect, but how
is it possible to mislay a husband?

23:42.396 --> 23:45.795
I've enjoyed knowing you,
Mrs Collins.

23:45.796 --> 23:47.355
Oh.

23:47.356 --> 23:51.075
You go to him, Miss Adams.
Go to him and bring him home to us.

23:51.076 --> 23:53.635
This is your home now.
I wish I could.

23:53.636 --> 23:56.195
Sensitivity for poor Mr Bligh,
I understand,

23:56.196 --> 23:59.595
but I'm going to say au revoir,
not goodbye,

23:59.596 --> 24:01.595
in the hope that we do meet again.

24:01.596 --> 24:03.355
You can't leave us!

24:03.356 --> 24:06.795
Oh, girls! Now, decorum!

24:06.796 --> 24:08.555
Oh!

24:08.556 --> 24:11.116
Ah.
We've come to say goodbye.

24:12.116 --> 24:16.275
Livvy's relocating to the city
until the tension subsides.

24:16.276 --> 24:18.475
How is your father?

24:18.476 --> 24:20.275
Trying to be strong.

24:20.276 --> 24:22.515
I'll be with him. Don't worry.

24:22.516 --> 24:24.035
Good.

24:24.036 --> 24:26.195
You saved me.

24:26.196 --> 24:27.996
Twice.

24:31.476 --> 24:34.875
Two reasons I'm glad
I came into your lives.

24:34.876 --> 24:36.715
Whatever happens,
I hope it brings happiness.

24:36.716 --> 24:38.195
And to you.

24:38.196 --> 24:40.796
I'm sure you'll be
a wonderful mother.

24:42.156 --> 24:43.915
I hope so.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.875
Take care.

24:45.876 --> 24:48.076
Come on.

25:16.876 --> 25:20.195
You're not to worry.
I can manage on my own.

25:20.196 --> 25:21.915
Are you sure?

25:21.916 --> 25:24.675
I'll do some shopping,
go to the cinema,

25:24.676 --> 25:26.595
perhaps see a show,

25:26.596 --> 25:28.915
and we will talk each night.

25:28.916 --> 25:33.155
It's just best I stay here until
matters at Ash Park have settled.

25:33.156 --> 25:35.035
All will be well.

25:35.036 --> 25:37.035
Go.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.915
I really think
I should stay the night.

25:38.916 --> 25:40.555
James...
I don't like to leave you.

25:40.556 --> 25:42.835
Especially at this stage.

25:42.836 --> 25:46.916
I have weeks yet. Stop worrying!

25:47.876 --> 25:51.915
Your father needs you more than I.

25:51.916 --> 25:54.155
Alright.

25:54.156 --> 25:57.836
Alright. 'Bye.

26:00.276 --> 26:02.716
Bye-bye, little one.

26:07.916 --> 26:10.396
Goodbye, darling.

26:22.476 --> 26:25.516
I wish to place
a person-to-person call.

26:33.316 --> 26:35.515
It seems we shall have
a house guest.

26:35.516 --> 26:37.955
Who?
Olivia Bligh.

26:37.956 --> 26:40.115
She's avoiding
some fracas at Ash Park.

26:40.116 --> 26:42.315
Andrew...
Fear not.

26:42.316 --> 26:45.636
Even I wouldn't assault
the virtue of a mother-to-be.

26:53.396 --> 26:56.156
Oh, I'm so glad you came!

26:57.236 --> 27:00.036
I've got something for you.

27:00.070 --> 27:03.949
It's in six weeks
and it's for two people.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.589
Your wedding.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.589
We'd love you to come.

27:07.590 --> 27:10.309
If anything could bring me back...

27:10.310 --> 27:14.949
I won't say goodbye
because it won't be for long.

27:14.950 --> 27:17.310
I love the way you view the world.

27:18.590 --> 27:21.270
Be happy, both of you.

27:22.870 --> 27:24.389
It wouldn't have
happened without you.

27:24.390 --> 27:26.150
Oh, it just might
have taken longer.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.110
I'm so glad we met.

27:35.150 --> 27:36.989
Jack told me.

27:36.990 --> 27:39.149
It's wonderful.

27:39.150 --> 27:41.429
I'm a lucky girl.

27:41.430 --> 27:43.829
I hope that works its magic.

27:43.830 --> 27:47.870
I'm sorry. I have so much to do.
Please, come back.

27:55.150 --> 27:58.149
I never thought I'd see the day
when that young slip of a girl

27:58.150 --> 27:59.869
would make more sense than you.

27:59.870 --> 28:01.630
I couldn't do it to George.

28:06.270 --> 28:08.150
George.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.750
I'm leaving.

28:14.990 --> 28:17.070
I don't blame you.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.949
You're my only family.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.749
You should have thought of that

28:22.750 --> 28:24.669
before you let Mother
draw you into her schemes.

28:24.670 --> 28:27.989
As you say, drawn in,
which hardly makes me culpable.

28:27.990 --> 28:29.990
Please see that.

28:30.990 --> 28:33.550
You're not welcome to stay again.

28:35.550 --> 28:37.910
But I may visit?

28:45.350 --> 28:47.910
At least that's not a no.

29:07.270 --> 29:09.109
Don't look so worried.

29:09.110 --> 29:13.230
Everything's going
to be alright. You'll see.

29:32.221 --> 29:33.921
Roy.

29:34.010 --> 29:35.810
Mr Bligh.

29:37.730 --> 29:39.529
How is she?

29:39.530 --> 29:41.849
She's not sure
which way's up or down.

29:41.850 --> 29:44.089
Part of her must be happy.
Part.

29:44.090 --> 29:46.409
Part of her is
as miserable as a wet bee.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.850
You being a gentleman is helping.

29:49.930 --> 29:52.170
You'll be seeing her
before she goes, I s'pose?

29:53.170 --> 29:55.169
Of course.

29:55.170 --> 29:58.729
Now, you can tell me to bugger off
if I'm overstepping the mark,

29:58.730 --> 30:00.810
but something needs saying.

30:01.810 --> 30:03.609
She's been doing
the rounds of goodbyes

30:03.610 --> 30:06.369
and it's clear as day
that she'll be missed

30:06.370 --> 30:09.209
and, by crikey, she's gonna miss us,

30:09.210 --> 30:12.329
but there's something
she needs to hear, Mr Bligh,

30:12.330 --> 30:15.130
and I reckon you're
the only one that can say it.

30:26.530 --> 30:28.689
Mr Briggs.

30:28.690 --> 30:30.649
Missy earned more love
in six months here

30:30.650 --> 30:32.449
than you've done in a lifetime.

30:32.450 --> 30:34.249
I reckon a lot of people around here

30:34.250 --> 30:36.529
are gonna be awake up to you
after this,

30:36.530 --> 30:39.530
and it's about time.

30:43.650 --> 30:46.769
You can't be serious.
I am.

30:46.770 --> 30:49.649
I...I couldn't.
Why not?

30:49.650 --> 30:52.569
I couldn't live with the deception.

30:52.570 --> 30:55.250
But if it were to save
your marriage...

30:59.410 --> 31:02.769
How could it possibly work?

31:02.770 --> 31:05.529
More simply than you can imagine.

31:05.530 --> 31:08.409
Tell your obstetrician
you've found a new man,

31:08.410 --> 31:10.689
then meet Dr Jarvis.

31:10.690 --> 31:14.169
A simple transfer of funds
sees the process underway.

31:14.170 --> 31:17.289
Jarvis finds a girl in trouble
with an imminent delivery,

31:17.290 --> 31:20.129
as soon as she goes into labour,
you're induced -

31:20.130 --> 31:23.049
a private clinic, of course,
discretion bought -

31:23.050 --> 31:26.689
and you emerge with a bonny
bouncing babe in your arms.

31:26.690 --> 31:28.609
And the mother?

31:28.610 --> 31:30.409
Will be well compensated

31:30.410 --> 31:32.369
for something she never
wanted in the first place.

31:32.370 --> 31:34.970
You'd be solving her problem too.

31:36.090 --> 31:38.409
It's unthinkable.

31:38.410 --> 31:40.650
You underestimate yourself.

31:45.050 --> 31:50.049
It's true that the last thing
the family needs is more
unhappiness.

31:50.050 --> 31:53.689
New life - what greater happiness?

31:53.690 --> 31:59.090
You can bring joy to everyone
if you're brave enough.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.270
Perhaps.

32:06.348 --> 32:07.868
I'll tell Mother to expect you.*

32:08.305 --> 32:11.784
Are you sure?
I don't mind staying here.

32:11.785 --> 32:14.704
No, you've too much time
alone here to think.

32:14.705 --> 32:17.504
Her prattle at least
serves as a diversion.

32:17.505 --> 32:19.944
I'll get proceedings underway
and hopefully, with any luck,

32:19.945 --> 32:21.864
it will all be over within a week.

32:21.865 --> 32:24.024
What if I change my mind?

32:24.025 --> 32:27.305
That is why I don't
want you here thinking.

32:27.628 --> 32:29.868
But what if I do?

32:30.868 --> 32:34.868
If that's at all possible,
we stop right now.

32:36.828 --> 32:39.467
When I sailed from England

32:39.468 --> 32:42.987
I could never have even
contemplated something like this.

32:42.988 --> 32:44.948
What happened?

32:46.348 --> 32:48.668
I was in love.

32:49.628 --> 32:53.107
I discovered it wasn't
what I thought it to be.

32:53.108 --> 32:55.068
What was it, then?

32:56.068 --> 33:00.187
Love still, but different.

33:00.188 --> 33:03.027
Stronger in a way.

33:03.028 --> 33:06.907
A sort of love I could
never have conceived of.

33:06.908 --> 33:08.627
There it is, then.

33:08.628 --> 33:10.427
A love you couldn't conceive

33:10.428 --> 33:13.107
saved by an act you would
never have imagined -

33:13.108 --> 33:14.748
a certain symmetry.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.221
Yes.

33:19.421 --> 33:20.461
So?

33:27.261 --> 33:29.900
Yes.

33:29.901 --> 33:32.741
Our driver will collect you.

33:53.261 --> 33:54.820
Hello.

33:54.821 --> 33:56.941
I thought you might
need the company.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.700
You will miss her.

34:04.701 --> 34:06.660
Oh, we all will.

34:06.661 --> 34:08.260
Not Mother.

34:08.261 --> 34:11.540
Oh, yes, she will,
possibly more than most.

34:11.541 --> 34:14.260
She hadn't had a crusade since
she got me out of the gutter.

34:14.261 --> 34:17.620
Sarah gave her one.
I hadn't thought of it that way.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.900
She got her fire back.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.860
Now she'll sit up there
with nothing to do

34:21.860 --> 34:23.580
but think about what this cost her.

34:23.581 --> 34:25.219
That's not a happy thought.

34:25.221 --> 34:28.020
George always
forgives her eventually.

34:28.021 --> 34:29.580
She's a tough old thing.

34:29.581 --> 34:32.580
She's nowhere near as tough as she
makes out, and with a crook heart.

34:32.581 --> 34:35.940
I've seen it before.
What?

34:35.940 --> 34:39.380
People like her give up.

34:39.380 --> 34:42.260
You're joking. Surely.

34:42.261 --> 34:47.380
Well, I reckon she's more
at risk here than George.

34:48.661 --> 34:51.179
You did tell Mr Bligh
I wished him to join me?

34:51.181 --> 34:54.179
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Well, then we'll need a second cup.

34:54.181 --> 34:56.580
He, um...

34:56.581 --> 34:58.940
..he said...

34:58.941 --> 35:02.941
Come on, girl. Out with it.
He said he'd better things to do,
ma'am.

35:03.941 --> 35:07.460
I see. Well, you may pour.

35:07.461 --> 35:10.500
Oh, perfect timing,
my darling. James!

35:10.501 --> 35:13.501
We will need
that second cup after all.

35:15.021 --> 35:16.660
Have you seen your father?

35:16.661 --> 35:18.300
Yes, I have.

35:18.301 --> 35:20.780
Look, I accept that
I have broken his heart,

35:20.781 --> 35:23.301
but I have saved him
from far worse in the future.

35:24.781 --> 35:27.980
Come and sit.
No, thank you. I won't.

35:27.981 --> 35:31.380
Surely this doesn't preclude
our taking tea together?

35:31.381 --> 35:34.220
I don't want Father thinking
there may be collusion.

35:34.221 --> 35:36.381
I see.

35:37.381 --> 35:40.420
Well, then I ask just one thing.

35:40.421 --> 35:42.020
Yes?

35:42.021 --> 35:47.101
Any glimmer of softening towards me,
will you encourage it, please?

35:48.381 --> 35:52.661
I will if I see it.
I suspect I won't.

35:58.501 --> 36:00.581
Oh, don't worry.

36:18.421 --> 36:20.061
Oh! Oh!

36:23.341 --> 36:27.020
Call it off!

36:27.021 --> 36:29.660
I suggest you get back in the car.

36:29.661 --> 36:32.980
I'll take to him with
the wheel brace if you don't!

36:32.981 --> 36:35.460
Lucky!

36:35.461 --> 36:38.140
Come here.

36:38.141 --> 36:40.580
Come here! Come here.

36:40.581 --> 36:42.940
Heel. That's it. Heel.

36:42.941 --> 36:46.301
Heel! Heel. Good boy.

36:47.781 --> 36:49.420
There's something you should know

36:49.421 --> 36:51.420
before you try
and malign me to George.

36:51.421 --> 36:53.140
You assume I will.

36:53.141 --> 36:55.260
You won't leave without trying.

36:55.261 --> 36:57.900
I know about James.

36:57.901 --> 37:00.460
I'd hate him to become
the source of rumour.

37:00.461 --> 37:02.620
You'd do that, wouldn't you?

37:02.621 --> 37:05.140
If I hear you've poisoned
George against me.

37:05.141 --> 37:07.980
I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction of warning him.

37:07.981 --> 37:10.380
I want you to know
when George doesn't want you

37:10.381 --> 37:12.500
it's for one reason only -

37:12.501 --> 37:15.741
because he sees you for what you are.

37:18.141 --> 37:20.541
Heel. Heel!

37:21.501 --> 37:24.021
I said I'd see you gone.

37:25.341 --> 37:27.781
Get her.

37:31.661 --> 37:33.141
Good boy.

38:21.326 --> 38:22.845
You all packed?*

38:22.846 --> 38:25.765
I'm on the late train.

38:25.766 --> 38:28.565
Would you like me
to take you to the station?

38:28.566 --> 38:31.006
I think it's best
that we say goodbye here.

38:32.046 --> 38:33.605
Roy is taking me.

38:33.606 --> 38:35.446
Of course.

38:36.766 --> 38:38.445
This should be enough.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.525
I will reimburse you.

38:40.526 --> 38:42.606
If you must.

38:43.766 --> 38:45.926
I wanted to...
Make sure that you...

38:46.926 --> 38:49.046
Please.
No, you.

38:51.326 --> 38:55.965
I won't lie. This breaks my heart.

38:55.966 --> 38:58.006
I'm trying to do what's right.

38:59.126 --> 39:01.406
I will always treasure
having met you.

39:02.406 --> 39:04.446
And me you.

39:05.726 --> 39:08.085
There's enough there
for your return flight

39:08.086 --> 39:10.765
and one back for your husband.

39:10.766 --> 39:15.285
There's something you need to hear
and it must come from me.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.565
You've found a home here

39:17.566 --> 39:20.446
and you shouldn't lose it
because we've lost each other.

39:21.566 --> 39:23.285
My heart would break even more

39:23.286 --> 39:27.245
if what we've had got in the way
of your coming back.

39:27.246 --> 39:31.565
If it seems right,
you bring him home.

39:31.566 --> 39:36.086
I couldn't do that.
If it's right, you have to.

39:48.046 --> 39:49.606
I love you.

39:50.686 --> 39:52.806
I always will.

41:21.886 --> 41:24.966
Olivia, dear,
how lovely to see you.

41:25.698 --> 41:28.313
Thank you so much.
Come on in.

43:32.533 --> 43:35.572
Sarah!

43:35.573 --> 43:37.412
Rene!

43:37.413 --> 43:39.253
No!

44:02.133 --> 44:04.373
Forgive me.

44:10.693 --> 44:12.932
I wanted to spare you.

44:12.933 --> 44:15.333
I know.

44:17.333 --> 44:19.692
Who did find him?

44:19.693 --> 44:22.132
Dr Duvalier.

44:22.133 --> 44:24.692
Etienne?
Two months ago.

44:24.693 --> 44:26.572
His first day on a new post

44:26.573 --> 44:29.292
he sees a man in a ward
for the war damaged.

44:29.293 --> 44:32.052
He thinks, "It cannot be.
He is dead."

44:32.053 --> 44:34.332
But it is Rene.

44:34.333 --> 44:36.773
He had been there for six years.

44:37.773 --> 44:39.652
Brain-damaged, not talking.

44:39.653 --> 44:42.653
Perhaps not wanting to.
They do not know.

44:44.133 --> 44:46.293
Jean Manais saw him shot.

44:47.293 --> 44:52.613
Perhaps a tired guard,
one with a conscience maybe.

44:54.973 --> 44:57.653
I don't care what state he's in.

44:58.653 --> 45:01.132
I need to see him.

45:01.133 --> 45:03.013
Which hospital?

45:04.613 --> 45:07.692
He is with me now.

45:07.693 --> 45:09.493
Here.

45:51.053 --> 45:53.053
Rene.

46:14.971 --> 46:19.134
My Darling... It's me.

46:20.492 --> 46:22.732
It's Sarah!

46:32.817 --> 46:37.739
I'm here Rene.

46:38.982 --> 46:41.109
I'm here.

46:49.693 --> 46:51.693
George.

46:54.573 --> 46:56.453
George?

47:00.133 --> 47:03.693
Wake up. Hmm?

47:05.693 --> 47:08.412
This is the first time he hasn't
managed to take himself to bed.

47:08.413 --> 47:10.252
Where is he?
In the sitting room.

47:10.253 --> 47:12.692
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing that concerns you.

47:12.693 --> 47:14.692
Is it Father? I'll help.

47:14.693 --> 47:17.652
Anna, he doesn't need the added shame
of your seeing him this way.

47:17.653 --> 47:19.612
Don't pretend you care
about his feelings.

47:19.613 --> 47:21.773
It's alright. I'll see to it.

47:23.133 --> 47:25.012
Anna, stop.

47:25.013 --> 47:27.612
Stop! She's right. He'd hate
for you to see him like this.

47:27.613 --> 47:29.252
I told you, I don't need protecting.

47:29.253 --> 47:31.132
I'm thinking about him, not you.

47:31.133 --> 47:33.612
And this war you've declared on
Grandmother is not helping. Anna!

47:33.613 --> 47:36.332
Anna, An...

47:36.333 --> 47:38.212
Go upstairs.

47:38.213 --> 47:41.052
She did this.
Listen to me.

47:41.053 --> 47:44.292
Look, every time you attack her
it feeds his anger

47:44.293 --> 47:47.052
and every night he has to
come down here and drown it.

47:47.053 --> 47:50.813
If you can't control yourself with
Grandmother you need to leave...

47:51.773 --> 47:53.493
..for his sake.

48:00.133 --> 48:02.212
Come on. Time for bed.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.493
Sarah...
Put your arm around me.

48:06.333 --> 48:08.693
Come on.

48:09.773 --> 48:11.612
You fell asleep.

48:11.613 --> 48:13.373
I'm alright.

48:14.333 --> 48:17.212
It's... it's my little girl.

48:17.213 --> 48:18.933
Don't you ever listen?

49:00.853 --> 49:03.773
And so to bed.

49:04.973 --> 49:07.852
Was there a point to sitting here?

49:07.853 --> 49:10.372
I like feeling close to him.

49:10.373 --> 49:13.052
Your brother-in-law?

49:13.053 --> 49:15.453
The worms had Elaine
long ago. Why not?

49:16.413 --> 49:19.612
Don't let me forget
to stay in your good books.

49:19.613 --> 49:23.813
Do what I'm paying you for and
there will be no cause for concern.

49:24.773 --> 49:26.772
Bed for us too, I think.

49:26.773 --> 49:29.852
How many beds are there
at this farm of yours?

49:29.853 --> 49:33.372
Spare me your tawdry innuendo.

49:33.373 --> 49:35.373
Drive!

49:49.053 --> 49:51.772
Duty calls.
Stay!

49:51.773 --> 49:53.893
It's tempting.

49:54.893 --> 49:56.773
Thank you for a wonderful night.

50:01.853 --> 50:04.892
There's an irony
in your concern for Mother's heart

50:04.893 --> 50:07.132
given this week suggests
she doesn't have one.

50:07.133 --> 50:09.613
I'm biting my tongue with Anna.
Don't you start too.

50:10.933 --> 50:14.012
Tell George I'll drop by.
Come now.

50:14.013 --> 50:17.052
I'd rather not rub his nose
in our happiness.

50:17.053 --> 50:19.292
Life goes on. He knows that.

50:19.293 --> 50:21.693
Right at this moment? Not so sure.

51:00.533 --> 51:02.052
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

51:02.053 --> 51:03.652
I'm glad you're both here.

51:03.653 --> 51:06.052
I'm pleased you've
decided to join us.

51:06.053 --> 51:07.932
I won't be staying.

51:07.933 --> 51:10.332
I wanted to apologise
for my behaviour of late.

51:10.333 --> 51:11.772
There's no need.
Please.

51:11.773 --> 51:13.412
There is. It won't happen again.

51:13.413 --> 51:15.052
I'm pleased to hear it.

51:15.053 --> 51:17.892
I'm sorry that you had to
see me like that.

51:17.893 --> 51:19.772
You're not the one
who should be apolog...

51:19.773 --> 51:21.573
Anna!
It's true.

51:22.613 --> 51:27.412
Anna was thinking of moving in
with Aunt Carolyn, weren't you?

51:27.413 --> 51:29.692
I'm happy to stay if you need me,

51:29.693 --> 51:32.012
but things might be better
if I'm not here.

51:32.013 --> 51:33.652
I don't want to drive you out.

51:33.653 --> 51:35.772
It's not you.

51:35.773 --> 51:38.253
Your aunt will be glad
of the company, I'm sure.

51:45.013 --> 51:47.492
A wise choice.

51:47.493 --> 51:49.773
Don't.

51:50.773 --> 51:53.133
Excuse me.

51:57.573 --> 52:01.813
Your father's apology,
Anna's departure, both to the good.

52:05.853 --> 52:07.732
She makes me sick.

52:07.733 --> 52:09.412
You two at it again?

52:09.413 --> 52:11.652
She breaks his heart
and then she just sits there

52:11.653 --> 52:13.212
blaming everyone else
for what's happening.

52:13.213 --> 52:15.132
You're upset. I understand.
But you've got to...

52:15.133 --> 52:17.252
I hate her!
No, no, you don't.

52:17.253 --> 52:18.852
Yes, I do.
You're getting carried away.

52:18.853 --> 52:20.892
I'm not a child, Jack.

52:20.893 --> 52:23.612
Fine, but whatever you're feeling,

52:23.613 --> 52:25.292
just remember your grandmother
hasn't been well.

52:25.293 --> 52:27.132
Go easy on her.
I hope it kills her.

52:27.133 --> 52:28.772
Anna!
We'd all be better off!

52:28.773 --> 52:31.772
Stop it! Stop acting
like a spoilt bloody brat.

52:31.773 --> 52:34.492
You can't talk to me like that.
Well, someone has to!

52:34.493 --> 52:36.412
You've got no right to...
I have every right!

52:36.413 --> 52:37.493
You're not my father!

52:40.133 --> 52:42.892
I'm her doctor

52:42.893 --> 52:45.173
and I'm your friend.

52:53.160 --> 52:56.326
I'm ashamed to admit
that I abandoned you.

52:57.244 --> 53:00.109
I searched for you
for a long time, but...

53:02.141 --> 53:04.159
not long enough.

53:06.949 --> 53:10.359
I don't know if you can forgive me.

53:16.813 --> 53:20.893
If you're in there, my darling,
I won't give up on you again.

53:21.443 --> 53:24.559
I promise you.

54:03.093 --> 54:05.612
Dr Jarvis has found a suitable girl,

54:05.613 --> 54:08.412
the perfect candidate, he says.

54:08.413 --> 54:10.172
Did he say when it might be?

54:10.173 --> 54:11.973
Any time now.

54:13.613 --> 54:17.412
It all feels very real suddenly.

54:17.413 --> 54:19.172
It will be soon.

54:19.173 --> 54:22.052
What will happen to my baby?

54:22.053 --> 54:26.332
It will be taken away.
It will be as if it never was.

54:26.333 --> 54:28.052
A proper burial surely?

54:28.053 --> 54:31.172
What we're doing is illegal.
But I can't just...

54:31.173 --> 54:34.973
As hard as it is,
you have to be strong on that.

54:40.133 --> 54:42.733
I should pack for the hospital.

54:43.693 --> 54:45.333
Be ready.

55:06.813 --> 55:09.892
Everything alright there, Mr Bligh?

55:09.893 --> 55:12.132
Checking the fences.

55:12.133 --> 55:15.452
Have you heard from Missy?
I don't expect to.

55:15.453 --> 55:18.692
You know, if you have a mind to

55:18.693 --> 55:21.492
there's always a cold beer
with your name on it at my place.

55:21.493 --> 55:24.452
No need to mag.

55:24.453 --> 55:27.132
I think I've overdone the alcohol.

55:27.133 --> 55:29.452
I might take you up
on a cuppa, though.

55:29.453 --> 55:31.172
Righto, then.

55:31.173 --> 55:33.093
I brew her up pretty strong.

55:34.933 --> 55:36.893
I'll see you.

55:43.413 --> 55:46.972
Well, it's up.
How about some time away, huh?

55:46.973 --> 55:49.772
No, I have to face
the consequences of my actions

55:49.773 --> 55:51.772
and the only way
to resolve matters with George

55:51.773 --> 55:53.532
is to bring things to a head.

55:53.533 --> 55:55.132
Even if it kills you?

55:55.133 --> 55:57.492
You're being Shakespearean.

55:57.493 --> 56:00.933
Any niggles at all, I want to know.

56:03.373 --> 56:06.812
Do you know
the greatest irony in all of this?

56:06.813 --> 56:11.453
I returned from Sydney with
a new admiration for Miss Adams.

56:12.453 --> 56:14.332
I was close to accepting her.

56:14.333 --> 56:18.852
If not for Regina's discovery,
I would have.

56:18.853 --> 56:20.612
Well, have you told George?

56:20.613 --> 56:25.052
Oh, it would simply sound like
a grovelling plea for forgiveness.

56:25.053 --> 56:27.693
Well, what if in the long run
he doesn't forgive you?

56:29.533 --> 56:33.453
Then I shall have to consider
doing the unthinkable. Hmph.

56:46.613 --> 56:48.612
G'day!

56:48.613 --> 56:50.452
I heard it was sold.

56:50.453 --> 56:52.772
That's right.

56:52.773 --> 56:55.772
I'm Roy Briggs. I've been
looking after the place.

56:55.773 --> 56:59.132
Now, no offence, old mate, but you
look like a bit of a city slicker.

56:59.133 --> 57:02.972
So if you wanna get rid of any
of this stock, just give us a hoy.

57:02.973 --> 57:04.972
I'm not the owner.

57:04.973 --> 57:07.692
Mrs Standish is.

57:07.693 --> 57:10.772
Mr Briggs, I believe.

57:10.773 --> 57:12.853
No doubt Miss Adams mentioned me.

57:13.813 --> 57:15.412
Too right she did.

57:15.413 --> 57:18.052
He's interested in the cows.

57:18.053 --> 57:20.533
Not that one, I'm not.

57:27.773 --> 57:30.373
Warm country welcome.

57:33.053 --> 57:36.492
If you're worried about
getting in the way, then don't.

57:36.493 --> 57:39.013
Jack and I love having you here.

57:40.533 --> 57:44.492
You and Jack,
it all happened very suddenly.

57:44.493 --> 57:46.252
Love can be sudden.

57:46.253 --> 57:48.812
So intense so quickly.

57:48.813 --> 57:50.772
Yes.

57:50.773 --> 57:54.652
I've had the silliest thought.

57:54.653 --> 57:56.453
Yes?

57:57.853 --> 58:01.772
Nothing. It... it feels good
to be away from Grandmother.

58:01.773 --> 58:05.013
I'm sure.

58:07.693 --> 58:10.252
I know what you're gonna ask.
It's gonna have to wait.

58:10.253 --> 58:12.412
You said a week
and it's been a week.

58:12.413 --> 58:14.692
I know...
We need to fill Sarah's position.

58:14.693 --> 58:16.492
We're understaffed.
We're managing.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.172
Just.

58:18.173 --> 58:20.132
We need to face facts.

58:20.133 --> 58:22.332
I'll put the word out.

58:22.333 --> 58:23.853
I will.

58:30.213 --> 58:31.892
Alma!

58:31.893 --> 58:35.492
Dr Duncan, I saw you come...
Are you sick?

58:35.493 --> 58:38.492
Uh, no. I have had a touch
of the collywobbles.

58:38.493 --> 58:41.692
But it's Miss Carolyn
I'm worried about.

58:41.693 --> 58:43.692
It's probably none of my business,

58:43.693 --> 58:47.972
but as a friend of Mrs Bligh's
her concerns are mine.

58:47.973 --> 58:49.492
The point, Doris?

58:49.493 --> 58:51.532
I presume she's ill - Miss Carolyn?

58:51.533 --> 58:53.612
Not that I know of.

58:53.613 --> 58:57.052
You see, I was delivering
pamphlets for the CWA

58:57.053 --> 59:00.412
and I couldn't help but see your car

59:00.413 --> 59:01.972
pulling away from
the cottage so early -

59:01.973 --> 59:03.852
naturally I thought she'd taken ill.

59:03.853 --> 59:06.613
I can't imagine another reason.

59:11.053 --> 59:14.412
I was leaving the cottage
because I stayed the night.

59:14.413 --> 59:17.532
Carolyn and I are seeing each other.

59:17.533 --> 59:20.572
As for Sarah,
I'm guessing she's not coming back.

59:20.573 --> 59:22.532
Anna and Gino
are still getting married.

59:22.533 --> 59:24.252
George is a broken man

59:24.253 --> 59:27.212
and Elizabeth Bligh has more trouble
than she knows what to do with.

59:27.213 --> 59:30.292
Miss anything?

59:30.293 --> 59:34.292
No, that was very thorough,
not that I care to know.

59:34.293 --> 59:36.893
Good. Do us all a favour
and stay out of it.

59:40.533 --> 59:42.373
The last thing
that family needs is gossip.

59:43.373 --> 59:45.173
Indeed.

59:49.333 --> 59:50.972
What was that about?

59:50.973 --> 59:54.773
No-one likes a stickybeak,
Alma, dear.

59:59.053 --> 01:00:01.412
Hello, George.

01:00:01.413 --> 01:00:05.252
I know I'm not welcome,
but as we'll be neighbours...

01:00:05.253 --> 01:00:06.852
Neighbours?

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:09.492
I signed the deed on that
quaint little Walker farm.

01:00:09.493 --> 01:00:11.332
And there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:13.892
George Bligh, Adam Farrell.

01:00:13.893 --> 01:00:16.212
Adam's come to give
his opinion on my purchase

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:18.212
and I've come to value his opinion.

01:00:18.213 --> 01:00:20.412
Mr Bligh.
Mr Farrell.

01:00:20.413 --> 01:00:23.132
We've had a rather whirlwind week,
haven't we, darling?

01:00:23.133 --> 01:00:25.492
We met on the flight home.
I see.

01:00:25.493 --> 01:00:27.052
I'd love your advice on the property

01:00:27.053 --> 01:00:29.492
if at all possible,
the practicalities.

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:31.372
I'm no use on that count.

01:00:31.373 --> 01:00:34.772
I know you love fixing things
and Lord knows it needs fixing.

01:00:34.773 --> 01:00:37.053
I'm surprised
you thought it appropriate.

01:00:38.053 --> 01:00:41.292
I want to be close by,
close to my only family.

01:00:41.293 --> 01:00:44.132
It can be made cosy, I'm sure.

01:00:44.133 --> 01:00:46.972
Nice to meet you, Mr Farrell.

01:00:46.973 --> 01:00:48.933
George, wait.

01:00:50.293 --> 01:00:52.572
I accept you may never forgive me,

01:00:52.573 --> 01:00:55.812
but please don't prevent
my seeing James and Anna

01:00:55.813 --> 01:00:57.813
and the little one when it comes.

01:00:58.813 --> 01:01:00.372
We'll see.

01:01:00.373 --> 01:01:02.652
That gives me hope.

01:01:02.653 --> 01:01:05.052
Would you mind if I freshened up?

01:01:05.053 --> 01:01:06.772
Of course.

01:01:06.773 --> 01:01:08.893
Keep Adam company.

01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:14.813
She regrets deeply what happened.

01:01:16.533 --> 01:01:20.453
I'm glad she has someone
concerned about her. Excuse me.

01:01:23.493 --> 01:01:26.372
You cannot seriously
intend living there.

01:01:26.373 --> 01:01:29.692
It can be made habitable
with George's help.

01:01:29.693 --> 01:01:31.932
It gives me reason to see him.

01:01:31.933 --> 01:01:33.652
And this new man is what?

01:01:33.653 --> 01:01:36.052
Some misguided attempt
to make George jealous?

01:01:36.053 --> 01:01:39.293
I'll be appealing to a far more
potent emotion than that.

01:01:41.213 --> 01:01:44.132
How are things with you two?
Healing the rift?

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:47.532
Would you please leave?
Clearly not.

01:01:47.533 --> 01:01:52.812
Do you have any
idea how completely tiresome this
is?

01:01:52.813 --> 01:01:56.052
How completely tiresome you are?!

01:01:56.053 --> 01:01:58.652
I've softened him more in 10 minutes
than you have in...

01:01:58.653 --> 01:02:00.213
Get out!

01:02:02.173 --> 01:02:05.092
Go on. Did you hear me?

01:02:05.093 --> 01:02:08.453
Leave! Enough!

01:02:11.613 --> 01:02:13.213
My pills...

01:02:15.853 --> 01:02:17.813
Oh...

01:02:39.733 --> 01:02:43.053
It's in your best interests
to support me.

01:03:04.873 --> 01:03:09.672
This, uh, town you wrote of...

01:03:09.673 --> 01:03:11.392
Inverness.

01:03:11.393 --> 01:03:14.792
It seems very special to you.

01:03:14.793 --> 01:03:17.113
It healed my soul.

01:03:18.793 --> 01:03:21.633
What is his name?

01:03:26.513 --> 01:03:28.673
How would you...

01:03:30.713 --> 01:03:33.273
Would you permit me
to take Rene there?

01:03:34.353 --> 01:03:37.353
To Inverness?
To heal.

01:03:40.513 --> 01:03:44.993
Let us hope you have reason to.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:58.086
Sweet dreams. I'll be next to you.

01:04:00.633 --> 01:04:03.873
Shh, you're safe now.

01:05:13.113 --> 01:05:15.033
Thank you, Colleen.

01:05:17.553 --> 01:05:20.853
Livvy.
Good morning, darling.

01:05:20.873 --> 01:05:22.392
You're up early.

01:05:22.393 --> 01:05:24.672
I couldn't sleep.

01:05:24.673 --> 01:05:27.072
Is everything alright?

01:05:27.073 --> 01:05:30.272
I just wanted to hear your voice.

01:05:30.273 --> 01:05:33.192
I'm glad,

01:05:33.193 --> 01:05:35.753
as long as you're enjoying yourself
and relaxing.

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:39.992
Well, you are, aren't you?

01:05:39.993 --> 01:05:43.152
Yes, yes, of course.

01:05:43.153 --> 01:05:45.952
Prudence and I thought
we might go to 'Call Me Madam'.

01:05:45.953 --> 01:05:47.512
It's the newest musical.

01:05:47.513 --> 01:05:50.553
Oh, that sounds fun.

01:05:53.753 --> 01:05:56.712
James...
There is something wrong.

01:05:56.713 --> 01:05:58.712
I'm coming to get you.
No, don't.

01:05:58.713 --> 01:06:01.113
Really, I am fine. I just...

01:06:02.073 --> 01:06:04.272
I miss you.

01:06:04.273 --> 01:06:06.553
I miss you too.

01:06:07.513 --> 01:06:09.552
But it's grim here.

01:06:09.553 --> 01:06:11.553
Better you're somewhere happy.

01:06:13.713 --> 01:06:16.033
I love you.

01:06:17.233 --> 01:06:19.352
More than anything.

01:06:19.353 --> 01:06:21.633
I love you too.

01:06:28.713 --> 01:06:30.473
You've eaten already.

01:06:31.473 --> 01:06:33.192
I couldn't sleep.

01:06:33.193 --> 01:06:35.072
Livvy sends her regards.

01:06:35.073 --> 01:06:38.392
Prudence Swanson
is spoiling her rotten.

01:06:38.393 --> 01:06:40.113
That's good.

01:06:41.513 --> 01:06:43.113
Thank you, son.

01:06:46.113 --> 01:06:51.112
I'd like a word with your father,
if I may, uh, alone.

01:06:51.113 --> 01:06:53.273
I'm expected at the sheds.
Please!

01:07:03.033 --> 01:07:06.512
Oh, George, if you have
something to say, say it.

01:07:06.513 --> 01:07:09.893
This petulant avoidance is
simply prolonging the inevitable.

01:07:09.909 --> 01:07:12.428
If I said what I really wanted to

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:16.309
it would be the last conversation
we ever had.

01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:27.188
Your papa will forget in time.

01:07:27.189 --> 01:07:29.748
Pardon?
Your father.

01:07:29.749 --> 01:07:31.348
What about him?

01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:33.588
Well, that is who
you're thinking about?

01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:36.028
In a way.

01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:39.228
I don't know.
I've had a strange thought.

01:07:39.229 --> 01:07:40.948
What is it?

01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:43.748
It just makes sense
of so many things,

01:07:43.749 --> 01:07:48.788
but if I say it and I'm wrong
they'll feel so stupid.

01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:51.588
I'm off into town!
Need anything?

01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:53.428
No, thank you!

01:07:53.429 --> 01:07:55.549
I'll see you soon.

01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:59.589
Wait. Wait.

01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:02.468
Tell me I'm not crazy.

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:05.428
I'm not, am I?

01:08:05.429 --> 01:08:08.949
Don't make me ask, please.

01:08:09.909 --> 01:08:11.788
Jack?

01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:14.109
Yes.

01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:18.229
He is.

01:08:26.389 --> 01:08:28.749
Well, this is more
than I'd hoped for.

01:08:30.988 --> 01:08:33.309
George.

01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:36.189
I'm glad I caught you.

01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:39.268
I've been thinking
about what you said

01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:41.108
and, uh, you're right.

01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:42.868
The blame does lie with Mother.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:45.627
That means more
than you'll ever know.

01:08:45.629 --> 01:08:48.868
And I... I would never
keep the children from you.

01:08:48.868 --> 01:08:51.508
Thank you.

01:08:51.509 --> 01:08:54.269
If not friends, at least not enemies?

01:08:56.429 --> 01:08:59.108
Tea?
That's all I came to say.

01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:01.268
Nice to see you.

01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:04.948
That's a weight off my mind.
Thank you.

01:09:04.948 --> 01:09:09.868
It's so isolated here.
I worry about her staying alone.

01:09:09.868 --> 01:09:11.787
It's a safe community.

01:09:11.788 --> 01:09:16.709
Even so, I feel better knowing
that you're there if required.

01:09:26.589 --> 01:09:29.349
You really are earning your salary.

01:09:30.589 --> 01:09:32.747
I do not envy you, my dear.
Really, I don't.

01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:35.028
All that endless
kicking and wriggling!

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:38.028
It's like a Mexican pinata
being struck from within.

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:40.308
I couldn't wait to
be rid of Andrew. Oh-ho!

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:43.428
Mmm, does that sound ghastly?

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.388
You understand, of course.

01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:47.188
I'm sure.

01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:48.747
Oh.

01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:50.788
I've got it!

01:09:51.948 --> 01:09:54.829
Swanson residence. Andrew speaking.

01:09:55.829 --> 01:09:57.948
The men never understand, of course.

01:09:57.949 --> 01:10:00.308
Oh, Andrew's father
was quite cavalier.

01:10:00.309 --> 01:10:02.108
I'm sorry?

01:10:02.109 --> 01:10:03.948
He was quite cavalier.

01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:07.228
I can't imagine why
I expected him to be otherwise.

01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:11.588
Oh, I mustn't be
such a dreary cynic.

01:10:11.589 --> 01:10:16.069
Oh, your James
is so adorable and so attentive.

01:10:17.029 --> 01:10:19.668
You know, it's quite charming,
the way he looks at you.

01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:22.388
Ohh!
Oh, my dear.

01:10:22.389 --> 01:10:24.069
Ohh!
Oh.

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:29.908
I'm sure it's nothing.

01:10:29.909 --> 01:10:31.508
I'll send for an ambulance.

01:10:31.509 --> 01:10:33.828
Quicker if I drive.
Oh, darling.

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:36.828
It may be a false alarm
and I don't want to worry anyone.

01:10:36.829 --> 01:10:38.308
Oh, if you're certain.

01:10:38.309 --> 01:10:41.189
I'll telephone from the hospital
if there's anything to report.

01:10:42.269 --> 01:10:44.668
Well done.
There's somewhere I need to go.

01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:46.668
But we're expected.

01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:48.869
It's on the way.

01:11:10.469 --> 01:11:13.588
Dear Heavenly Father,

01:11:13.589 --> 01:11:16.989
I don't know
if you're still listening.

01:11:17.949 --> 01:11:24.148
But if you are,
please bless the soul of our child.

01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:28.588
Take our poor baby into your arms.

01:11:28.589 --> 01:11:33.429
Forgive me for what I am about to do.

01:11:34.589 --> 01:11:37.188
I know it's wrong,

01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:42.189
but it's for James, for our marriage.

01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:45.789
Please understand.

01:11:52.349 --> 01:11:54.349
Amen.

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:08.709
What is it? What's so urgent?

01:12:09.749 --> 01:12:12.429
Two and two's finally
made four, my darling.

01:12:44.378 --> 01:12:49.611
I'm here... It's alright.

01:12:50.094 --> 01:12:55.551
You're safe now, you're safe.

01:12:58.546 --> 01:13:03.145
I'm here.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.560
Rene.

01:13:34.173 --> 01:13:38.012
The young woman has gone into labour
so we're going to induce you now.

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.613
What's going to happen?

01:13:39.676 --> 01:13:42.475
You're going to give birth exactly
as you would to a healthy baby.

01:13:42.476 --> 01:13:45.715
And the girl, does she know
where her child is going?

01:13:45.716 --> 01:13:48.155
Only that the infant
will find a good home.

01:13:48.156 --> 01:13:50.115
She'll be looked after financially.

01:13:50.116 --> 01:13:52.515
It is imperative
this remains a secret.

01:13:52.516 --> 01:13:56.075
Discretion is as important for us
as it is for you.

01:13:56.076 --> 01:13:57.915
Now let's get you
to the labour ward.

01:13:57.916 --> 01:13:59.955
I'll telephone James
at the appropriate time.

01:13:59.956 --> 01:14:01.396
Thank you.

01:14:03.996 --> 01:14:05.595
Thank you for everything.

01:14:05.596 --> 01:14:08.155
Now you must be strong, Mrs Bligh.

01:14:08.156 --> 01:14:11.355
There's rough water
before we make the harbour.

01:14:11.356 --> 01:14:12.676
Good luck.

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:16.956
Don't look when
they take the little one away.

01:14:20.196 --> 01:14:23.155
I would have told you straightaway
if it had been just about us.

01:14:23.156 --> 01:14:25.195
I know.

01:14:25.196 --> 01:14:29.275
Sometimes you have to put other
people's feelings ahead of your own.

01:14:29.276 --> 01:14:30.916
Yes.

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:34.956
Go on.

01:14:35.956 --> 01:14:38.915
No matter what you feel right now
towards your grandmother,

01:14:38.916 --> 01:14:40.555
don't forget you love her

01:14:40.556 --> 01:14:43.275
and you always will.

01:14:43.276 --> 01:14:46.915
I think I just gave you
my first piece of fatherly advice.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.316
I think you did.

01:14:52.156 --> 01:14:54.516
She needed this...

01:14:56.476 --> 01:14:59.036
..to help stop her hating.

01:15:01.356 --> 01:15:02.916
What?

01:15:04.316 --> 01:15:06.395
When we first met, I thought,

01:15:06.396 --> 01:15:09.195
"I know exactly
what she sees in him."

01:15:09.196 --> 01:15:11.116
You're very handsome.

01:15:12.076 --> 01:15:14.315
But you're so much more than that.

01:15:14.316 --> 01:15:18.116
I sold you short. You're a fine man.

01:15:21.916 --> 01:15:23.676
I'm returning to Sydney.

01:15:25.276 --> 01:15:28.915
George came to see me.
He offered an olive leaf.

01:15:28.916 --> 01:15:30.915
I'm sure the branch will come,

01:15:30.916 --> 01:15:34.836
which, sadly, he seems disinclined
to extend to you.

01:15:36.916 --> 01:15:41.355
I'm your only hope, Elizabeth.
You'll see that soon enough.

01:15:41.356 --> 01:15:43.755
I'll see you at Anna's wedding.

01:15:43.756 --> 01:15:48.396
Oh, that's right -
you're not invited.

01:15:56.636 --> 01:16:00.916
Regina informs me you have
softened somewhat towards her.

01:16:01.916 --> 01:16:03.915
George?

01:16:03.916 --> 01:16:06.275
Oh, for goodness sake,
will you talk to me?

01:16:06.276 --> 01:16:08.155
No.

01:16:08.156 --> 01:16:09.795
Oh, so you're just going to drown

01:16:09.796 --> 01:16:11.515
whatever it is you're feeling
with that?

01:16:11.516 --> 01:16:14.316
That will not help you
to forget her.

01:16:16.156 --> 01:16:18.395
I'm not drinking to forget her.

01:16:18.396 --> 01:16:20.155
Please just leave.

01:16:20.156 --> 01:16:22.035
No, not until we've had this out.

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:23.635
Leave!
I'm not going anywhere.

01:16:23.636 --> 01:16:26.555
Please!
No!

01:16:26.556 --> 01:16:28.955
Do you want to know
why I'm drinking?

01:16:28.956 --> 01:16:33.956
I'm drinking because I finally see
who you are and it repulses me.

01:16:34.916 --> 01:16:38.315
I'm drinking, Mother,
to drown my hatred for you.

01:16:38.316 --> 01:16:40.955
What made you like this?

01:16:40.956 --> 01:16:44.675
Did Father not want you?
Did you repulse him as well?

01:16:44.676 --> 01:16:47.395
So you poured
all of your misery into us.

01:16:47.396 --> 01:16:50.795
A mother sacrifices for...
A mother loves!

01:16:50.796 --> 01:16:52.555
She wants joy for her children.

01:16:52.556 --> 01:16:55.315
You? You can't bear
to see us make our own choices...

01:16:55.316 --> 01:16:56.835
That's not true.

01:16:56.836 --> 01:16:58.355
..because if they do make us happy

01:16:58.356 --> 01:17:00.915
it simply highlights
what a desperately unhappy life

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.876
you've made for yourself.

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:20.516
Pardon.

01:17:21.425 --> 01:17:24.412
Some wine?

01:17:24.416 --> 01:17:27.316
Oui, merci.

01:17:34.036 --> 01:17:35.755
He will improve.

01:17:35.756 --> 01:17:38.635
My tears are for you, not him.

01:17:38.636 --> 01:17:41.475
This is what I had feared.

01:17:41.476 --> 01:17:44.236
You are tied to him now.
There is no hope.

01:17:49.476 --> 01:17:54.076
A week ago I thought he was dead.
There's always hope.

01:17:55.876 --> 01:17:59.155
You must face the truth.

01:17:59.156 --> 01:18:02.995
He will never be the man
you loved. Never.

01:18:02.996 --> 01:18:06.035
I won't let you sacrifice
everything out of duty.

01:18:06.036 --> 01:18:08.876
It's not duty. It's love.
Is it?

01:18:09.876 --> 01:18:12.355
Or the memory of love?

01:18:12.356 --> 01:18:17.596
That life, that precious time
with him is gone.

01:18:19.476 --> 01:18:22.475
Please, Sarah, I beg you, go home.

01:18:22.476 --> 01:18:26.635
Go back to your new love,
to your happiness, to your hope.

01:18:26.636 --> 01:18:28.595
Oh...

01:18:28.596 --> 01:18:31.076
Oh, my dear friend.

01:18:36.476 --> 01:18:40.036
You asked my permission
to return with him.

01:18:42.116 --> 01:18:46.316
I give you my permission
to return without.

01:18:54.116 --> 01:18:58.035
Nearly there, Mrs Bligh.
Nearly there.

01:18:58.036 --> 01:19:00.355
Good girl, good girl. One more push.

01:19:00.356 --> 01:19:02.195
And push. One more.

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:04.355
That's it.

01:19:04.356 --> 01:19:06.676
Good girl, good girl. There we are.

01:20:23.029 --> 01:20:25.309
It's Sarah.

01:20:28.429 --> 01:20:31.229
Can you hear me?

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:35.982
Please, Rene. Please.

01:20:38.982 --> 01:20:41.382
Hello. James Bligh.

01:20:42.527 --> 01:20:46.366
Father!

01:20:46.367 --> 01:20:49.047
The baby, it's coming.

01:21:05.167 --> 01:21:07.086
I'm sorry. I would
ask you to come, but...

01:21:07.087 --> 01:21:09.127
Darling, I understand.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:14.127
You go with my blessing.

01:21:33.087 --> 01:21:35.967
No, no.

01:21:38.047 --> 01:21:40.487
I don't know if I can.

01:21:43.567 --> 01:21:45.407
It's alright.

01:22:09.367 --> 01:22:11.926
It's a boy.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.326
Is... is he...

01:22:14.327 --> 01:22:17.607
He's perfect.

01:22:28.927 --> 01:22:31.846
Whoa!

01:22:31.847 --> 01:22:34.126
To the new Bligh!

01:22:34.127 --> 01:22:35.607
Now you're an aunty.

01:22:43.607 --> 01:22:45.646
Congratulations, old man.

01:22:45.647 --> 01:22:47.807
Oh, my darling.

01:23:05.927 --> 01:23:08.807
Your son.

01:23:52.887 --> 01:23:55.687
Good morning, my love.

01:24:10.567 --> 01:24:12.247
Sarah?
