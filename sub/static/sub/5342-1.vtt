01:27.587 --> 01:29.754
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.089
- How's it...
- What?

01:32.091 --> 01:37.293
What's going on... Am I
missing something? What?

01:46.535 --> 01:48.302
Let me take a shower.
Five minutes.

01:48.304 --> 01:50.470
You think about me
getting all wet and soapy.

01:50.472 --> 01:53.539
I'll shower with you.
Ronnie's here.

01:53.541 --> 01:56.041
- Who cares?
- Hey.

01:56.043 --> 02:00.278
I need your help sometimes, and
you need mine. Just ask me...

02:00.280 --> 02:02.913
You want me to tell you
to shut your mouth?

02:02.915 --> 02:04.848
I'll tell you to shut
your mouth.

02:09.219 --> 02:13.121
Get out! Get the fuck
out of here! Go!

02:13.123 --> 02:15.490
Who the fuck do you
think you are?! Go!

02:15.492 --> 02:18.826
Get your shit, and
get out of here! Go!

02:18.828 --> 02:24.597
Go blow your head off... And do it from the
back so that your fucking face disappears...

02:24.599 --> 02:26.632
Get out of here! Go!

02:26.634 --> 02:29.101
Go! Get out! Go!

02:29.103 --> 02:30.635
Go!

03:03.499 --> 03:05.600
Hey... You can't sleep here.

03:11.773 --> 03:13.440
Do you have an outlet?

03:27.954 --> 03:31.056
Whoa, whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

03:31.058 --> 03:32.390
You can't do that.

03:33.558 --> 03:35.058
It's not that serious.

04:14.897 --> 04:16.863
It's completely disconcerting.

04:16.866 --> 04:18.932
You're being ridiculous,
this is, this is ridiculous.

04:18.934 --> 04:22.235
- You're a liar!
- I just wanted to take a shower.

04:22.237 --> 04:24.437
It was an hour before people got
here and we had to leave time

04:24.439 --> 04:27.006
for you to put your socks on
for twenty-five minutes.

04:27.008 --> 04:30.275
No, don't, don't change the conversation.
We're talking about one thing.

04:30.277 --> 04:33.177
Well, what the fuck, I had a lot of
stuff rattling around in my head.

04:33.179 --> 04:35.746
I'm sorry I didn't make
the right expression

04:35.748 --> 04:37.111
when you tried to shoot
cum all over my face.

04:37.137 --> 04:37.881
The right expression?

04:37.883 --> 04:40.717
You swatted my dick away,
like it was a hornet's nest.

04:40.719 --> 04:44.454
Well, don't try to come on my face like
it's something I've suddenly signed off on.

04:44.456 --> 04:49.091
I didn't try to come on your... I pointed... I
pointed it down at your breasts... You said,

04:49.093 --> 04:51.927
"come on my tits",
so I pointed it at your...

04:51.929 --> 04:53.962
You know how I get... When I'm about to
come I would like to look into your eyes

04:53.964 --> 04:56.297
and see that you're feeling
something, you know...

04:56.299 --> 04:59.867
That you're in the moment, just...
Ten minutes of performance.

04:59.869 --> 05:05.872
Lie to me, convince me that you might
possibly be, you know, excited about my dick.

05:05.874 --> 05:08.428
Well, I wasn't in the
moment because you were...

05:08.454 --> 05:09.575
You're not listening.

05:09.577 --> 05:14.246
I have to do a lot of things. You know,
I'm, I'm running around with a list,

05:14.248 --> 05:17.115
I'm vacuuming and buying
fucking limes,

05:17.117 --> 05:22.085
and you're puttering around staring
into shadows like Abraham Lincoln.

05:22.087 --> 05:25.488
What are you doing? Alan!

05:25.490 --> 05:30.625
Alan, you want to look me in the
eyes and shoot cum in them? Look...

05:33.495 --> 05:36.430
When we land tomorrow...

05:36.432 --> 05:41.934
And we get in that nice hotel
you got a great deal on,

05:41.936 --> 05:48.073
I'll draw a hot bath, and... We'll
put on your trip playlist, and...

05:48.075 --> 05:55.513
Light some candles, and you can blow all the
cum you want all over my body, and I'll laugh,

05:55.515 --> 05:57.748
like a fucking lunatic, okay?

05:57.750 --> 06:00.617
You're choosing not to understand.
You could understand.

06:00.619 --> 06:03.987
Give me a break. I'm sorry, babe,
but this is really stupid, okay?

06:11.928 --> 06:17.098
Hey... oh my God.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.167
You're so, you're... Cool.

06:20.169 --> 06:23.470
We wanted to say hi before
we have to get her home.

06:23.472 --> 06:27.874
Oh, you're leaving now? You just got
here, we didn't really get to...

06:27.876 --> 06:29.609
She's tired.

06:45.225 --> 06:46.858
Shit. Cool.

06:46.860 --> 06:48.392
Two blocks down
and two blocks up.

06:48.394 --> 06:49.960
Two blocks that way?

06:49.962 --> 06:51.227
- Yes, sir.
- And then to the left?

06:51.229 --> 06:52.861
Yes.

06:52.863 --> 06:55.063
"He should just grab
me and show me."

06:55.065 --> 06:56.831
"Raise your head, lift
your arm, turn this way."

06:56.833 --> 06:58.899
Yeah, but that's so literal.

06:58.901 --> 07:02.968
Thank you so much for coming,
and bringing the little one.

07:02.970 --> 07:04.803
- Let me just open this for you.
- Oh, sure.

07:06.305 --> 07:09.473
- Alright, bye! See you! See you.
- Bye.

07:11.843 --> 07:13.910
You missed the baby.

07:13.912 --> 07:15.278
I'm heartbroken.

07:16.346 --> 07:18.080
Here, you just gotta...

07:24.653 --> 07:27.254
- Where'd you learn that?
- Law school.

07:43.203 --> 07:45.504
The horn guys were just sort of
staring at the ground, you know,

07:45.506 --> 07:48.673
and then he came up, and
he just rambled on about...

07:48.675 --> 07:51.676
You know, how we have
to be political,

07:51.678 --> 07:54.278
like freedom to do this and that.
It was kind of wild.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.847
- Why, why don't you sit down?
- I'm good, I'm fine.

07:56.849 --> 08:00.716
Well, anyway, so he got up there, and
he drew this out for an eternity

08:00.718 --> 08:02.617
about how we're all one people.

08:02.619 --> 08:04.385
And then some guy just got up

08:04.387 --> 08:06.253
and yelled at him to play
another song...

08:06.255 --> 08:08.855
But, by that time,
the contract had been broken.

08:08.857 --> 08:11.090
The fun was completely over.

08:11.092 --> 08:13.192
- Oh! Shit!
- I'm sorry!

08:13.194 --> 08:16.261
Why did you do that?
You're always spilling things.

08:16.263 --> 08:19.597
- Everything alright?
- Shit. They found me.

08:25.603 --> 08:28.771
Everyone's so fascinated
by that helicopter. -Yeah.

08:28.773 --> 08:31.306
Helicopter.

08:31.308 --> 08:34.732
What about those girls over there?
Are they fussy?

08:34.758 --> 08:36.275
Like fussy ballerinas?

08:36.278 --> 08:40.212
They're women, not girls. -I just wanna
jam my fingers in that bun on her head.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.948
It looks kind of like a
duckpin bowling ball.

08:42.951 --> 08:46.719
You know, the naked yearning coming out of
you is getting a little tough to stomach.

08:46.721 --> 08:50.622
The walls aren't your goddamn journal.
And you can't stick your fingers

08:50.624 --> 08:53.124
- in a duck pin bowling ball.
- Excuse me.

08:53.126 --> 08:55.659
That's asinine.
And now Farrah left.

08:57.261 --> 08:59.228
- Mat's here?
- What?

08:59.230 --> 09:00.896
Mat's on the couch.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.851
Farrah!

09:24.853 --> 09:31.090
Oh! Hi! You guys, you guys, I've
been seeing you from afar...

09:31.092 --> 09:34.359
Hey, nice dress. -Thanks!
A friend made it for me.

09:34.361 --> 09:36.160
Help yourself to drinks!

09:41.599 --> 09:43.866
I think you were wearing that
same shirt

09:43.868 --> 09:46.468
- the last time we saw you.
- I don't know.

09:46.470 --> 09:48.835
It's been three months.
You should change.

09:48.861 --> 09:50.705
Are those fish on your dress?

09:50.707 --> 09:54.008
- You have fish on your dress.
- Sardines.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.109
- They're sardines.
- Sardines... interesting.

09:58.145 --> 10:02.548
Hey, who is that girl
over there, the one with the...

10:02.550 --> 10:06.184
- Like the, uh, cantaloupe on her head?
- Will you hand me those pillows?

10:06.186 --> 10:08.186
I want to make sure
everyone's comfortable.

10:09.221 --> 10:10.788
Do you have scotch?

10:10.790 --> 10:12.389
- Her name is Elinor...
- Elinor.

10:12.391 --> 10:15.558
And she hates her body.
You should be fine.

10:20.730 --> 10:23.298
- Are you behaving?
- I think so! Really?

10:23.300 --> 10:26.134
Excuse me, can you pass me my bag?
That's my bag.

10:26.136 --> 10:28.870
Oh! Sorry.

10:28.872 --> 10:32.306
This is good, I was just
going to say hi. -Hey.

10:32.308 --> 10:35.242
You're back from Chicago?
Are you in New York now?

10:35.244 --> 10:38.645
Huh? -I'm sorry, I'm David.
We've met before.

10:38.647 --> 10:42.882
- I'm an old friend of Alan's.
- Oh yeah. Hey. Hi.

10:42.884 --> 10:47.018
- How's the website?
- Uh, which one?

10:47.020 --> 10:49.386
You forgot. It's okay.

10:52.089 --> 10:55.324
You were going to do this site for me for this
animation class I teach at Columbia prep.

10:55.326 --> 10:57.492
Because I thought it would be fun. We
were e-mailing back and forth about it.

10:57.494 --> 11:00.161
Yeah. -And you went to...
you were in Chicago, right?

11:00.163 --> 11:02.696
- And you didn't have access to something.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

11:02.698 --> 11:06.399
- Sure.
- Yeah. It's fine.

11:06.401 --> 11:10.202
I did put, like, down for it...
It was actually my own money.

11:10.204 --> 11:12.270
- I don't mean to corner you...
- You know, it's not even...

11:12.272 --> 11:14.338
- It's a down payment.
- Yeah.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.841
Yeah, let me send you something.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.643
I don't know if we need it anymore
because I'd kind of given up...

11:19.645 --> 11:22.812
- Hey, hello?
- Okay.

11:22.814 --> 11:25.113
Yeah, how're you doing?

11:26.815 --> 11:28.582
No, not really.

11:32.853 --> 11:38.223
Deep inside, I believe that
this world we live in

11:38.225 --> 11:42.860
is really a big, huge,
monumental,

11:42.862 --> 11:44.728
symphonic orchestra.

11:47.631 --> 11:51.700
What is this music?
Oh goddammit.

11:51.702 --> 11:57.038
And in its primordial form,
all of creation is sound.

12:00.809 --> 12:06.513
It's not just random sound.

12:06.515 --> 12:08.081
It's music.

12:09.483 --> 12:13.819
Who said that? Michael Jackson.

12:13.821 --> 12:17.189
- Is that what you're saying?
- I'm not saying that at all.

12:17.191 --> 12:20.592
Hey! Don't bother people, okay?

12:20.594 --> 12:22.527
I'm not bothering him. I thought
he might have a menthol,

12:22.529 --> 12:24.195
he thought I might have
some cocaine.

12:24.197 --> 12:26.764
Fucking mouse! Goddamn it.

12:26.766 --> 12:29.600
Are you serious? -Mouse? I
thought this dump was clean.

12:29.602 --> 12:32.402
Oh, cause really you know
what clean is, mat.

12:32.404 --> 12:36.038
Let's go in the living room. -Can
I have that cigarette? Thank you.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.940
He's lucky we keep the guns
in our country home.

12:38.942 --> 12:41.108
- I hate mice.
- Yeah, me too.

12:43.411 --> 12:45.111
You mind if I?

12:48.281 --> 12:50.248
Strange air in here.

12:50.250 --> 12:53.918
Yeah, it's a dance company
and some people from work.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.920
Kind of a funny mix. Yeah, I can
definitely tell who your friends are.

12:58.422 --> 13:00.456
- Yeah.
- Hey.

13:00.458 --> 13:06.061
- You guys were fascinating tonight.
- Fascinating?

13:06.063 --> 13:10.365
They ended their season tonight.
This guy Mickey was in this duet

13:10.367 --> 13:13.468
where he was like a wild bronco
being tamed, it was...

13:13.470 --> 13:19.139
- That sounds like torture.
- Yeah.

13:19.141 --> 13:23.042
It's not for everyone. -Yeah,
cause I'm a fucking philistine.

13:23.044 --> 13:25.110
- Are you having fun?
- I'm having so much fun.

13:25.112 --> 13:27.612
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Yes.

13:27.614 --> 13:30.047
- I'm just worried about you.
- Everyone's been so nice.

13:30.049 --> 13:33.050
- Oh, good.
- She seems icy.

13:33.052 --> 13:37.287
Farrah? She's fine. -She's like gritty.
Cracks me up.

13:37.289 --> 13:40.483
Yeah. Well, the timing's
a little unfortunate.

13:40.509 --> 13:42.658
We should be packing right now.

13:42.660 --> 13:45.494
- Yeah, you going somewhere?
- Canada.

13:45.496 --> 13:48.630
- Hiking up in Nova Scotia.
- You getting help?

13:48.632 --> 13:52.867
Quebec... What? No, we're
paying for it ourselves.

14:00.575 --> 14:02.809
It's so I can propose to her.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.844
What?

14:07.413 --> 14:11.282
We both had it sort
of planned out.

14:11.284 --> 14:15.785
The trip was so I could
ask her to marry me.

14:15.787 --> 14:19.788
You arranged it? Together?

14:19.790 --> 14:24.525
Yeah. Yeah. We talked it over.
To death.

14:26.094 --> 14:27.828
Sounds traumatic.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.535
I'm glad you came.
I didn't know if you were...

14:35.537 --> 14:38.538
- I've been here.
- Yeah, well...

14:38.540 --> 14:43.141
I didn't get an e-mail back, so I just
figured you were on some anger loop

14:43.143 --> 14:45.343
for three months
just screaming at the wall.

14:45.345 --> 14:47.211
No.

14:47.213 --> 14:48.712
This place is cozy.

14:55.719 --> 14:59.655
- Hey, do you guys have any cookies?
- Cookies?

14:59.657 --> 15:02.491
- Farrah, do we have any cookies?
- What?

15:02.493 --> 15:05.560
- Do we have any cookies?
- Did you look?

15:05.562 --> 15:08.563
- Do you know if there are any left?
- Did you look?

15:08.565 --> 15:10.364
For the cookies?

15:11.999 --> 15:14.033
I'm just asking if you
happen to know if we...

15:26.512 --> 15:28.746
Sorry. Sorry.

15:28.748 --> 15:32.249
This is John, we lived together in college.
John, mat. My brother.

15:32.251 --> 15:37.486
- You two bond over Jamiroquai?
- The music's good tonight, right?

15:37.488 --> 15:41.556
It's fine for hand-me-down taste. You
resisted my music for so many years.

15:41.558 --> 15:43.190
Your music.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.858
I didn't even know music was
playing.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.693
So, John, were you
on the squash team?

15:46.695 --> 15:50.596
Were you an improve comedian?

15:50.598 --> 15:54.532
- I was in a group that sang madrigals.
- Goddamn right you were.

15:54.534 --> 15:56.567
Yeah, John was a real pussy
magnet.

15:56.569 --> 16:01.003
You gonna sing something for us?
Come on, sing something for us!

16:01.005 --> 16:02.637
- He wants to.
- Yeah he does.

16:10.044 --> 16:14.179
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
No you don't.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.515
Hello? Hello?

16:17.517 --> 16:20.384
Holy shit. Earl, I didn't
know you were coming.

16:20.386 --> 16:25.521
Oh, I love this. I love it.
I'm sorry I missed the show.

16:25.523 --> 16:28.190
- Don't tell Farrah.
- Earl.

16:28.192 --> 16:30.625
Oh, I talked to your mother
yesterday.

16:30.627 --> 16:33.260
Uh, she told me about Sharon... You hear
about your aunt Sharon and her wrists?

16:33.262 --> 16:35.562
Yeah, I did. Did you hear about this?
She tried to kill herself.

16:35.564 --> 16:37.797
- I heard about it.
- You didn't hear about it.

16:37.799 --> 16:41.200
- What, mom doesn't call me about things?
- Ugh, I mean, try paraquat,

16:41.202 --> 16:47.405
Sharon, try a... your aunt has been
crying wolf ever since I was a teenager.

16:47.407 --> 16:51.041
Your dad's side and your mom's side...
you two come from colliding stormfronts.

16:51.043 --> 16:53.376
Hi, mat. -So Earl, you
still pissed at me?

16:53.378 --> 16:56.177
I don't know. Maybe I am. Have
you talked to your dad lately?

16:58.780 --> 17:03.049
Hello, you! I missed your thing.
I'm terrible. Was it amazing?

17:03.051 --> 17:05.785
Yes, it was amazing.
You look so cool.

17:05.787 --> 17:08.763
I'll never be as cool as you.
It's all a charade.

17:08.790 --> 17:10.923
Don't worry about cool.
This is mai.

17:10.925 --> 17:14.826
Hi! She's from Korea. She's
a spectacular filmmaker.

17:14.828 --> 17:18.628
I call her dark and stormy. -Oh,
do you like it when he does that?

17:18.631 --> 17:20.797
No, I don't. -Hey Farrah,
do you have a boys' room?

17:20.799 --> 17:24.500
Yes, of course.
Alan, get mai a drink.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.935
- Uh, yeah, what do you drink?
- No thanks.

17:26.936 --> 17:30.705
- You don't drink? I mean...
- You smoke dope?

17:39.313 --> 17:40.346
Who needs wine?

17:43.750 --> 17:48.620
I dreamt about searching through
my history last night.

17:48.622 --> 17:53.524
The history on my web browser.
That was the whole dream.

17:54.826 --> 17:56.927
You want a good dream tonight?

18:01.097 --> 18:03.031
So this guy over there
he's in this one where

18:03.033 --> 18:05.033
he's like a wild bronco
being tamed...

18:05.035 --> 18:09.203
It was like kinetic, exciting.
I mean, it was amazing.

18:09.205 --> 18:13.707
Then Farrah comes on and they're
all in these gray and black robes.

18:13.709 --> 18:16.509
'A world beyond color
and light.'

18:16.511 --> 18:22.481
I just... I felt like I was watching
some survivalist tract from the future.

18:22.483 --> 18:28.887
- Like post-apocalyptic semaphore.
- I read that.

18:28.889 --> 18:32.523
Is that James Wolcott?
So you can read the Internet.

18:33.558 --> 18:35.258
Yeah, well.

18:38.128 --> 18:39.828
He was right.

18:39.830 --> 18:43.531
When did you read that?
A couple of days ago.

18:43.533 --> 18:47.501
- You read reviews before tonight?
- Yeah, I was curious.

18:47.503 --> 18:50.136
It stuck with me I guess because
he was right, you know.

18:50.138 --> 18:52.538
There was no... It wasn't
exciting.

18:52.540 --> 18:55.340
The technique was... Solid.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.648
You'd know better about
that, but conceptually,

18:57.674 --> 18:59.377
'a world beyond
color and light'...

18:59.379 --> 19:01.846
It just...
It just made me feel hopeless.

19:01.848 --> 19:04.548
Sounds great. I hope there's
a DVD copy.

19:04.550 --> 19:06.349
Well, we don't have a TV, so...

19:06.351 --> 19:08.417
- You don't have a TV?
- No, we don't have a TV.

19:08.419 --> 19:10.552
- So this is bohemia.
- Oh, you know what, you guys,

19:10.554 --> 19:13.521
I have a video of rehearsal
on my phone.

19:13.523 --> 19:18.925
Okay, so it didn't give you that
happy, tingly feeling you paid for.

19:18.927 --> 19:24.263
Come on. Who likes to feel bad? -Okay,
but even happy things just roll off you.

19:24.265 --> 19:27.366
- They do, Alan. They do, they do.
- Okay.

19:27.368 --> 19:32.236
I'm happy you liked Mickey's dance. Even if
you called it exciting, which, by the way,

19:32.238 --> 19:36.273
almost everything you like, you say
you like because it's exciting.

19:36.275 --> 19:40.010
It's just most people pursue art...
they go after it to engage feelings

19:40.012 --> 19:43.346
that they have or don't have...

19:43.348 --> 19:46.615
To clarify emotions and to be
comforted by the fact

19:46.617 --> 19:48.783
that they're not alone in
feeling them.

19:48.785 --> 19:50.985
That's why you pursue art.

19:50.987 --> 19:54.821
I'm gonna eat a bullet if
we keep watching this. -Mat.

19:54.823 --> 19:56.522
It's just,
I could do without...

19:58.791 --> 20:01.292
Without his opinion sometimes.

20:01.294 --> 20:04.695
It could be anything, it could be
like some movie with talking animals

20:04.697 --> 20:07.330
and fart jokes...

20:07.332 --> 20:12.201
And when we see these things, I brace
for it, I brace for your opinion.

20:12.203 --> 20:16.705
It's exhausting. -Well, I will
try to change that about myself.

20:16.707 --> 20:19.407
- Come on, we're just talking.
- How's it going, mai?

20:19.409 --> 20:21.242
I think you would hate
my movies.

20:21.244 --> 20:23.310
- Oh, no, no, no.
- They're not exciting.

20:23.312 --> 20:25.945
Yes they are. -Oh, one
does have talking animals.

20:28.882 --> 20:31.550
- I don't get it.
- Getting out an opinion first

20:31.552 --> 20:33.718
doesn't make it or your more
interesting.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.653
- Do you need a refill?
- It's just defense.

20:35.655 --> 20:38.489
- Do we have any more limes?
- Please don't be mad.

20:38.491 --> 20:40.691
- No, I mean, I forget.
- Alan...

20:40.693 --> 20:43.160
You're still working your stuff
out, your, your opinions.

20:43.162 --> 20:45.695
Some of us who went to college have
already worked this stuff out.

20:45.697 --> 20:48.931
Alan. You're not done working stuff out.
You're nowhere near done.

20:48.933 --> 20:51.199
Yeah, I don't know, maybe...
Can someone settle this?

20:51.201 --> 20:54.001
We can all just drop it and talk
about how right you are...

20:54.003 --> 20:59.872
Because you are so right, I mean you are
like so right, I mean, you are like right.

20:59.874 --> 21:03.609
Listen, just even the way he described
the performance sounds like

21:03.611 --> 21:06.211
it was really great,
I'm so sorry I missed it.

21:06.213 --> 21:08.112
Even he couldn't make it not
sound great.

21:09.848 --> 21:11.181
Earl.

21:19.623 --> 21:21.889
Nice. -Um, how long have
you been dancing for?

21:21.891 --> 21:24.591
- Man, I've been dancing for a while.
- Yeah?

21:24.593 --> 21:27.860
- Yeah, about ten, twelve years.
- And you're gay?

21:27.862 --> 21:30.462
- And I'm gay.
- Cool.

21:30.464 --> 21:32.363
Yeah.

22:46.470 --> 22:49.772
When we were young,
we'd go weeks without showering.

22:49.774 --> 22:53.942
If we stayed dirty enough, we'd
think of it as the essential scent.

22:53.944 --> 22:58.812
True bottom. The smell of your self.
We thought, maybe unwisely,

22:58.814 --> 23:01.948
that smelling like our true selves
would drive the ladies mad.

23:01.950 --> 23:06.018
That our authenticity would lead
to romance... -And handjobs.

23:06.020 --> 23:07.886
Handjobs are romance.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.956
I was living in a studio
near 71st and Columbus

23:12.958 --> 23:15.892
back when you could
get mugged there...

23:15.894 --> 23:22.564
- Sorry, I don't know why this is on there.
- No, keep it, it's good.

23:22.566 --> 23:26.868
It's delicious. So your father visits me...
He's in for a conference...

23:26.870 --> 23:29.704
And he's only in for one night,
so we're going to get dirty,

23:29.706 --> 23:32.239
we're going to layer
on the filth with a trowel...

23:32.241 --> 23:35.375
Until we're dominated,
dominated in black...

23:35.377 --> 23:40.146
Now, so, this is the predictable part...
Yelling at strangers, drugs and women...

23:40.148 --> 23:43.149
- Okay, Earl, just take it easy.
- What?

23:43.151 --> 23:46.919
I don't know most of these people and
you're talking about our father and women.

23:46.921 --> 23:52.690
Your dad fucked other women. He
doesn't anymore. He doesn't now.

23:52.692 --> 23:56.927
- Done. Are you still hurt? Get over it!
- Take it easy. Take it easy!

23:56.929 --> 24:00.764
Your dad is fine, by the way.
He's doing just fine.

24:03.834 --> 24:07.736
So I think we cabbed it down to
Max's, which was in its second phase

24:07.738 --> 24:11.106
then trying to make our way through
that scene for like half an hour.

24:11.108 --> 24:16.544
We felt like a couple of squares, but
we were sure they didn't get it either.

24:16.546 --> 24:20.180
There was a lot more
mingling in the city then.

24:20.182 --> 24:23.682
- Sounds pretty magical.
- It's better now.

24:26.218 --> 24:30.387
I don't know. It's different.

24:30.389 --> 24:35.858
Anyway - you all will never
know! Sorry!

24:35.860 --> 24:40.462
- When was this?
- Uh - oh, ah... probably 78'?

24:40.464 --> 24:43.231
Jesus. Where was I?

24:43.233 --> 24:46.701
You were crapping in a diaper
somewhere.

24:46.703 --> 24:51.404
We met this girl, very earthy and
Jewish, which your dad enjoyed...

24:51.406 --> 24:53.639
Can you just get to the end? This
is like a root canal for me.

24:53.641 --> 24:55.741
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

24:55.743 --> 24:58.543
- Okay, okay! She wanted us both!
- Awh, my God. Oh my God.

24:58.545 --> 25:03.113
No, that was her thing, and,
well... She's who we found.

25:05.549 --> 25:08.717
I'm remembering it all again, we were
in this one room the whole time,

25:08.719 --> 25:14.221
and as I look over to your dad,
who's - he's - he's going on top-

25:14.223 --> 25:17.157
- well, it - it was his turn, so...
- Awh!

25:17.159 --> 25:25.159
So, he raises his arm, and gives this
big, deep sniff of his armpit in and out,

25:25.166 --> 25:30.935
in and out - and he yells at
this girl, "this is me!"

25:30.937 --> 25:34.904
This is me! This is who I am!"

25:37.308 --> 25:40.342
That was the closest your dad
ever got to poetry.

25:40.344 --> 25:44.512
- Oh my God. What did she do?
- Oh, she was into it.

25:54.422 --> 25:58.991
When I look in the mirror,
I change my face immediately.

25:58.993 --> 26:03.861
So I never know what expression I'm making.
It's like a correction.

26:03.863 --> 26:10.801
Now, I have a question. Being that you guys
are French, do you say "9/11" or "11/9?"

26:10.803 --> 26:13.503
Run! Come on, let's go!

26:20.644 --> 26:22.211
No. No, no, no, no, no.

26:22.213 --> 26:24.513
Yes, yeah,
yeah you are the best.

26:24.515 --> 26:26.848
Look at you, seeing us off.

26:26.850 --> 26:30.351
Hey, their mom and me? We love
you, do you hear me? We love you.

26:30.353 --> 26:34.788
Oh. Thanks. -Be good, you two!
Hey Alan. Bye.

26:34.790 --> 26:39.358
- Alright. Bye mai, I enjoyed meeting you.
- Oh, likewise!

26:39.360 --> 26:41.092
Get out of here.

26:43.195 --> 26:44.862
Hey!

26:44.864 --> 26:47.831
- Where's your green dress?
- Which?

26:47.833 --> 26:51.134
- Uh, it hits, like, above your knees?
- The bright green one?

26:51.136 --> 26:53.969
Yeah. I got us a reservation.

26:55.338 --> 26:59.841
At a place.
It has a michelin star.

26:59.843 --> 27:01.475
You did?

27:01.477 --> 27:04.010
- Yeah.
- Already?

27:04.012 --> 27:07.613
Wow. You're funny.

27:22.227 --> 27:26.095
What is this? What happened
to music you can dance to?

27:26.097 --> 27:28.730
Seriously. Change it, please.

27:28.732 --> 27:30.064
Done.

27:30.066 --> 27:31.298
Oh, thank you.

27:34.602 --> 27:36.135
That's nice.

27:39.005 --> 27:41.272
Oh, I like that.

27:51.516 --> 27:52.916
Farrah.

27:59.923 --> 28:03.292
Hey! Dance with us, you lump.

29:34.449 --> 29:36.816
<i>Each with his bonny lass,</i>

29:54.133 --> 29:56.701
hey, Alan! Get up!

29:56.703 --> 29:59.704
The flight's leaving in ninety minutes.
Hey! Wake up!

29:59.706 --> 30:01.706
It's Laguardia?

31:39.571 --> 31:41.138
Fuck, Alan.

32:15.272 --> 32:18.107
Hey, man.
Hey, you have a menthol?

32:18.109 --> 32:20.609
Why do you think
I have a menthol?

32:20.611 --> 32:22.510
I don't think you have a menthol, I
was just hoping you had a menthol.

32:22.512 --> 32:25.479
- You have a cigarette?
- I have a menthol!

32:25.481 --> 32:29.316
<i>- Bacon, egg and cheese on a roll.
- Okay. Turkey bacon is okay?</i>

32:29.318 --> 32:33.786
Turkey bacon. No! Hold on,
never mind. Can I get uh...

32:33.788 --> 32:36.655
Please will you give us...

32:36.657 --> 32:39.524
You want chopped cheese? -Chopped cheese?
What's a chopped cheese?

32:39.526 --> 32:41.526
Chopped cheese
is chopped cheese.

32:41.528 --> 32:44.028
- Alright, I'll get a chopped cheese.
- You like.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.863
You got it. You'll love it,
buddy.

32:45.865 --> 32:49.600
Oh! You guys
have... e-cigarettes?

33:46.124 --> 33:49.025
<i>He-man! Do guys last very long?</i>

33:49.027 --> 33:50.894
<i>No, but you know what, I can</i>
<i>always get them hard again,</i>

33:50.896 --> 33:54.631
<i>and I have fun the second</i>
<i>round.</i>

33:54.633 --> 34:00.470
<i>Hi, Texas man, how are you? I can
come just by having them sucked.</i>

35:00.297 --> 35:02.765
<i>I always wanted</i>
<i>to raise my kids on a farm.</i>

35:02.767 --> 35:05.367
<i>So starting a dairy</i>
<i>was a good way to do that.</i>

35:05.369 --> 35:07.635
<i>So when you say you started a
dairy, what do you mean by that?</i>

35:07.637 --> 35:10.771
<i>We bought fifty cows, learned</i>
<i>how to milk them the night...</i>

35:28.322 --> 35:31.757
Ow! Fuck!

35:31.759 --> 35:33.491
Fuuuck.

35:36.127 --> 35:37.527
Shit!

35:44.634 --> 35:47.802
Hey, man, I'm Alan's brother
from upstairs. -Yeah.

35:47.804 --> 35:50.104
I, you can see I...
Do you have any band-aids?

35:50.106 --> 35:52.239
Alan doesn't have
any fucking band aids.

35:57.010 --> 35:59.511
It's not a trick question, there's
blood all over the stairs.

35:59.513 --> 36:01.212
Do you have any band aids?

36:03.815 --> 36:06.750
<i>It's all grass-fed milk.
And the fat is on top.</i>

36:06.752 --> 36:09.953
<i>And the reason we leave the fat is because
that is where all the benefits are...</i>

36:42.852 --> 36:45.186
The promise of a new day.

37:03.703 --> 37:05.489
You don't have to smoke
those by the window.

37:05.515 --> 37:06.838
That's the point
of those things.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.573
I disagree.

37:11.643 --> 37:13.710
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

37:13.712 --> 37:17.312
They have tuna.
And a fucking nice can opener.

37:19.148 --> 37:23.183
- I don't think I like it here.
- You did last night.

37:23.185 --> 37:25.485
Plus, it's bug-free.

37:25.487 --> 37:28.421
I got up to pee and my mind
went crazy.

37:28.423 --> 37:34.326
I started wondering how Ronnie was
doing at his sleepover with Deshawn...

37:34.328 --> 37:36.728
I was trying really
hard not to text him, but...

37:40.899 --> 37:43.500
What if they come back?
The brother and his girlfriend?

37:43.502 --> 37:46.635
Look, you don't have to stay here if
the energy alignment makes you queasy.

37:48.938 --> 37:53.441
You begged me to come. -I never
beg you to come, sweetie.

37:53.443 --> 37:56.110
Jesus, look, just do
what you want.

37:56.112 --> 38:00.514
He's hurt. How could I abandon
him and his bloody appendage?

38:09.257 --> 38:11.057
I'm gonna take a walk.
Do you want to take a walk?

38:11.059 --> 38:14.860
- What? My foot kills.
- I'm gonna get Ronnie.

38:14.862 --> 38:16.164
I'm gonna surprise him.
I'll see you later.

38:16.190 --> 38:17.229
Where're you going to take him?

38:17.231 --> 38:19.085
Jennifer said that we
can crash at her place.

38:19.111 --> 38:19.956
Maybe we'll do that.

38:24.235 --> 38:26.402
Bring him here.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.003
Bring him here?

38:54.596 --> 38:58.131
This is sixty megahertz? I know about
refresh rates and megahertz...

38:58.133 --> 39:00.500
It's as important as resolution.

39:00.502 --> 39:03.236
I mean, it makes a difference, but
it's not a crucial difference.

39:03.238 --> 39:06.239
The actual amount of time you'll actually
spend watching something at full 1080.

39:06.241 --> 39:08.507
I mean, it's 720. It's great.

39:08.509 --> 39:11.076
So I should just give you my
cash because I'm some deadbeat?

39:11.078 --> 39:15.746
Do you want 240 megahertz? Do you want 600?
They're both a lot more money.

39:15.748 --> 39:19.483
I was thinking about financing. -Oh, right.
Right. Well, you known,

39:19.485 --> 39:22.786
I mean, not everything requires
full resolution.

39:22.788 --> 39:26.489
Do you really need the best TV?

39:26.491 --> 39:30.493
What about just a less shitty one; A
TV that's better than your current TV.

39:30.495 --> 39:33.128
I mean, this TV here, that TV
there, you watch the Mets game,

39:33.130 --> 39:34.796
it's the same Mets,
you know what I mean?

39:34.798 --> 39:39.367
So what is your...
Installment plan?

39:39.369 --> 39:44.705
I'll be honest with you, this isn't a
not good TV and it's almost affordable

39:44.707 --> 39:50.177
as long as your credit's okay, like slightly
okay, you can finance it, you're able man.

40:06.393 --> 40:10.562
Mat! It's a TV.

40:17.803 --> 40:20.638
- It's really heavy.
- You can't pick it up?

40:20.640 --> 40:22.473
- No, I can't.
- Try it.

40:26.543 --> 40:28.210
Oh my God!

40:35.317 --> 40:39.519
<i>The marijuana plant has taken root
in Dugan and Martinez's household</i>

40:39.521 --> 40:41.187
<i>like a weed.</i>

40:41.189 --> 40:43.889
<i>What began as innocent</i>
<i>experimentation</i>

40:43.891 --> 40:47.759
<i>quickly descended</i>
<i>into something far darker.</i>

40:47.761 --> 40:52.017
<i>I began to notice anger
under Martinez's laugh.</i>

40:52.043 --> 40:54.765
<i>Sadness beneath Dugan's smile.</i>

40:54.767 --> 40:59.402
<i>It was clear to me that it was just a
matter of time before their true natures...</i>

42:28.090 --> 42:32.325
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

42:32.327 --> 42:35.494
- Watching TV?
- It's pretty bad.

42:35.496 --> 42:36.628
I think there's a rat inside it.

42:36.630 --> 42:38.096
There is not.

42:41.967 --> 42:44.601
This bed is so comfy, right?

42:44.603 --> 42:46.669
Yeah.

42:46.671 --> 42:50.005
I didn't like it at first;
It's memory foam.

42:50.007 --> 42:51.439
Memory foam?

42:58.480 --> 43:01.348
- Did you brush your teeth today?
- Yes.

43:03.718 --> 43:06.686
- What?
- You are a liar.

43:10.556 --> 43:14.158
You've gotten so good at that.
Aw, man.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.194
You used to be so obvious.

43:17.196 --> 43:19.062
I didn't brush my teeth.

43:21.465 --> 43:27.702
You lie more as you get older, you know.
And then, at some point,

43:27.704 --> 43:32.639
you'll start lying less because you
realize there's not that much point.

43:35.042 --> 43:38.978
That's when we can tell
each other actual secrets.

43:38.980 --> 43:41.680
When?

43:41.682 --> 43:47.318
When you're honest again.
Fifteen, twenty years.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.486
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, I'm not mad.

43:49.488 --> 43:53.656
I'm just turning away because
your breath's so horrible.

43:53.658 --> 43:55.557
I should fart on you. Get even.

43:57.726 --> 44:00.227
<i>Red riding had never</i>
<i>seen a wolf before.</i>

44:00.229 --> 44:02.762
<i>She thought he was the most</i>
<i>beautiful brown dog...</i>

44:08.401 --> 44:12.237
<i>Meanwhile, Mr. wolf ran slyly
through the wood, along the path,</i>

44:12.239 --> 44:15.440
<i>and over the hill, until</i>
<i>he reached grandmother's...</i>

44:21.613 --> 44:25.916
<i>Perhaps granny'd been ill,</i>
<i>with no one to look after her.</i>

44:25.918 --> 44:30.086
<i>'Oh, grandmother, how you've changed!
What long ears you have',</i>

44:32.723 --> 44:35.890
<i>Oh, grand...</i>

44:35.892 --> 44:40.594
<i>Your nose! What a long nose you have!
All the...</i>

45:29.743 --> 45:34.646
<i>Grandmother was ever so grateful to
see red riding hood safe and sound.</i>

45:34.648 --> 45:37.682

proud of his trusty old gun.</i>

46:03.307 --> 46:06.042

46:29.799 --> 46:33.568
What is this? Jesus. Where'd you get this?
Put it back.

46:33.570 --> 46:38.205
Sorry. -Why is your bag
out in the hallway?

46:48.715 --> 46:50.749
Mom, I need to show you
something in the closet.

46:50.751 --> 46:54.152
You can when I'm done.
You wanna show mat?

46:54.154 --> 46:56.220
There's something
you should see in the closet.

46:56.222 --> 46:58.689
- What?
- I'd like to offer him dinner.

46:58.691 --> 47:01.892
- We know, you cooked food.
- Did he call you or anything?

47:01.894 --> 47:04.561
He told me he was going
to be away for two weeks.

47:04.563 --> 47:06.829
- Where's the girlfriend?
- I don't know.

47:06.831 --> 47:09.263
Oh, jeez. Let's just not make
a soap opera out of it, okay?

47:11.899 --> 47:14.200
Ice cream!

47:14.202 --> 47:17.570
Hey, the ice cream truck is here. Hey,
can we go, can we go get ice cream?

47:17.572 --> 47:21.573
Let's go. My treat. Unless you've
got cash because otherwise

47:21.575 --> 47:23.174
I have to go to an atm.

47:23.176 --> 47:25.242
- Should we leave?
- And go where?

47:25.244 --> 47:27.444
I don't know. We could
probably stay with Richard.

47:27.446 --> 47:29.245
I mean, we could.

47:29.247 --> 47:30.779
- Richard?
- What?

47:30.781 --> 47:32.848
- Nothing.
- Is he gonna be mad?

47:32.850 --> 47:35.283
- Richard?
- No, Alan.

47:35.285 --> 47:37.885
Oh, Alan? I don't know. I don't
care, I can stay here if I want.

47:37.887 --> 47:40.287
I don't give a shit what Alan
thinks...

47:49.363 --> 47:51.697
Mind if I have some of this?

47:51.699 --> 47:55.600
What is it, chicken? -It is...
it's chicken. I cooked it.

47:58.704 --> 48:02.039
- Hi, I'm Andrea.
- Alan.

48:11.983 --> 48:16.586
The bridge was like, uh, the bridge was
like floating... Or not floating...

48:16.588 --> 48:21.223
It was suspended over the water...
It was a stunning waterfall...

48:21.225 --> 48:24.359
It was really exciting.

48:24.361 --> 48:27.495
Quebec is... the city of quebec
is really beautiful.

48:27.497 --> 48:32.566
It's interesting. It's got
a really exciting...

48:32.568 --> 48:37.103
Architecture to it. Like it's scaled
for the eighteenth century, you know,

48:37.105 --> 48:40.372
for people who are, like,
half a foot shorter than us.

48:40.374 --> 48:43.074
- Like, have you ever been to France?
- Yeah, I have.

48:43.076 --> 48:45.776
- You went to France?
- Yeah.

48:45.778 --> 48:52.014
Oh, well, I always assumed
that Paris felt like that.

48:53.217 --> 48:54.883
What is that, Delaware?

48:54.885 --> 48:56.117
No, I don't have credit cards
anymore.

48:56.119 --> 48:57.952
So how bad can it be?

48:57.954 --> 49:00.354
Just answer the fucking phone
or turn it off.

49:00.356 --> 49:02.756
- Excuse me.
- He's heard worse.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.994
Hi, this is mat, I'd love
to talk to you right now.

49:10.262 --> 49:12.129
Hello?

49:12.131 --> 49:14.764
I told you I would get
you a sample as soon as...

49:14.766 --> 49:17.633
- Are you okay?
- Uh, no.

49:21.303 --> 49:24.104
I don't want to talk about it.

49:24.106 --> 49:27.440
We're gonna leave.
We would be home now.

49:27.442 --> 49:31.143
Obviously, but our building
has bed bugs.

49:31.145 --> 49:33.879
- They are spraying for it.
- You have bed bugs?

49:33.881 --> 49:36.281
You brought your stuff here?
No, no, we don't, the building.

49:36.283 --> 49:42.386
And my super swears that it's
not bed bugs, but radon.

49:42.388 --> 49:44.321
Wow, those are two really
different things.

49:44.323 --> 49:46.723
I told mat that I would
call Ronnie's dad.

49:46.725 --> 49:52.762
He is a nightmare, but we can
totally stay with him. I will call.

49:52.764 --> 49:57.666
Yeah, um, do whatever... I mean,
stay tonight, if you want,

49:57.668 --> 50:00.869
my house is, you know... stay.

50:05.574 --> 50:09.643
Ice cream! Come on, let's go, I
want to get some goddamn ice cream!

50:17.918 --> 50:21.520
My vanilla ice mama.
Where goes the boy?

50:21.522 --> 50:26.757
- Hey, Ronnie. Wait up!
- Where is the ice cream truck?

50:26.759 --> 50:28.692
It's everywhere.

52:51.968 --> 52:53.568
I'm sorry.

53:00.475 --> 53:03.510
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine.

53:08.449 --> 53:11.484
<i>Hi, this is Farrah.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

53:21.527 --> 53:24.095
So yeah, I just felt like
coming in.

53:24.097 --> 53:28.666
My brother's staying
with me... us,

53:28.668 --> 53:31.869
and it's just,
it's a little, you know,

53:31.871 --> 53:35.472
he's kind of,
he's kind of a lot.

53:35.474 --> 53:41.411
It's kind of nice
to come see you guys, check in.

53:50.987 --> 53:53.388
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:53.390 --> 53:56.690
Hey, Fede, what's up, man?
You look good.

53:58.225 --> 54:00.125
We're talking.

54:00.127 --> 54:03.228
- Yeah, great.
- So did you bring the notices?

54:03.230 --> 54:05.063
I have the notices.
I haven't opened them.

54:05.065 --> 54:07.865
- Why not?
- I'm not opening mail right now.

54:07.867 --> 54:10.033
- Wait, what's the deal?
- We're good here.

54:10.035 --> 54:12.702
No, what happened? -They're evicting
him at the end of the month.

54:12.704 --> 54:14.704
What? Are the girls
with their mother?

54:14.706 --> 54:16.072
Two boys, two boys...

54:16.074 --> 54:17.640
- They're with you?
- Yes.

54:17.642 --> 54:18.974
- How many months are you behind?
- Three.

54:18.976 --> 54:21.009
It's nothing.

54:21.011 --> 54:22.810
I was doing a remodeling gig
with my sister's boyfriend.

54:22.812 --> 54:24.545
- We talked about this already.
- Yeah, I know,

54:24.547 --> 54:26.280
- I wasn't here.
- That's true, you weren't.

54:36.390 --> 54:38.657
I know they know how much
I'm messing up.

54:40.660 --> 54:44.929
I keep thinking about in twenty
years, they'll be saying,

54:44.931 --> 54:48.399
"and then we got kicked out
of our apartment..."

54:48.401 --> 54:50.434
"Cause our dad didn't check
the mail..."

54:52.170 --> 54:55.572
"And that's when things got bad.
I didn't have a home,

54:55.574 --> 54:59.609
and I started sucking cocks
on twelfth Avenue."

54:59.611 --> 55:03.345
I keep thinking about my son sucking
cocks for money on twelfth Avenue.

55:05.748 --> 55:08.216
Well...

55:08.218 --> 55:12.786
You know, in this economy,
any job is a blessing.

55:12.788 --> 55:16.256
Don't make a joke, man. -You
ever do video chats? Like, Skype.

55:16.258 --> 55:20.259
- Yeah, all the time.
- I skyped with my dad last week.

55:20.261 --> 55:22.194
Nice.

55:22.196 --> 55:25.630
Yeah, he's kind of a prick, um,
that's just the way he is.

55:25.632 --> 55:31.034
My brother can't stand him, which I think
is partly why I could never stand him.

55:31.036 --> 55:33.269
I usually just talk to him on
the phone, but my mom was like,

55:33.271 --> 55:35.204
no, no,
it's got to be a video chat...

55:35.206 --> 55:37.906
Alan, we don't need
to talk about this right now.

55:37.908 --> 55:41.242
I think she just wanted me to look at him
shaking, you know... his head, shaking.

55:41.244 --> 55:44.812
I don't even remember what we... Oh yeah we
talked about this e-mail that he printed out,

55:44.814 --> 55:47.815
and I was like, "dad, you don't
have to print out the e-mail",

55:47.817 --> 55:51.952
you can just read it
off the screen."

55:51.954 --> 55:54.788
I don't know. It made me pretty sad.
Maybe it was what my mom wanted...

55:54.790 --> 55:57.757
She wanted me to look at him.

55:57.759 --> 56:00.926
- Your dad was shaking?
- Yeah, he's got Parkinson's...

56:00.928 --> 56:03.027
I said that, did I not say that?

56:04.796 --> 56:06.763
Yeah, I bummed around.

56:06.765 --> 56:10.433
You bummed around brasilia?
Is it a good place?

56:10.435 --> 56:14.069
What is a "good" place?
You know?

56:14.071 --> 56:16.004
Hey, Ronnie, how are ya, kid?

56:16.006 --> 56:20.074
Oh, so, did Ronnie tell you
that he called me from a bodega?

56:20.076 --> 56:22.943
He used his sandwich money.

56:22.945 --> 56:27.647
You called him from a bodega,
Ronnie, you have a phone.

56:27.649 --> 56:30.015
I didn't want you to know
I called, okay?

56:32.151 --> 56:36.687
<i>Hi, this is Farrah,</i>
<i>please leave a message.</i>

56:36.689 --> 56:40.857
Hey, it's me. I'm home...

56:40.859 --> 56:42.925
It's, like, Thursday...

56:44.594 --> 56:47.729
Afternoon. Um, mat's here.

56:49.998 --> 56:53.000
Admit it, be honest,
you're embarrassed.

56:53.002 --> 56:57.137
<i>Your voice... someone should bottle
it up and throw it at terrorists.</i>

56:57.139 --> 57:00.373
<i>- This is inappropriate. It is wrong.
- What's wrong?</i>

57:00.375 --> 57:04.376
I hope you're... You know...

57:06.645 --> 57:09.113
I love you. Call me.

57:09.115 --> 57:14.284
Good for you, you're saving him. Ronnie,
you are so damaged. How does that feel?

57:14.286 --> 57:20.122
Alan, this is Richard, sorry. -Nice
to meet you. Sorry to impose.

57:20.124 --> 57:24.292
It's fine. You're from Rahway,
right?

57:24.294 --> 57:27.461
I'm from Mahwah.
So, you're the brother?

57:27.463 --> 57:30.197
The brother, yeah.
You told me he was from Rahway.

57:30.199 --> 57:33.200
- I said Ronkonkoma.
- Ronkonkoma's long island.

57:33.202 --> 57:36.336
So you're from Mahwah,
but not Rahway or Ronkonkoma.

57:36.338 --> 57:39.806
- You got it.
- Ever been to ho-ho-kus?

57:39.808 --> 57:41.641
- Ho-ho-kus?
- Yeah.

57:41.643 --> 57:43.709
Yeah, you guys are funny.
You ever live there?

57:43.711 --> 57:45.977
Uh, no, but believe it or not,
my mother is from ho-ho-kus.

57:45.979 --> 57:48.179
- It's true.
- Get out of town! She is?

57:48.181 --> 57:51.348
She still live there? -Uh, no,
she's not with us anymore.

57:51.350 --> 57:52.816
She's not!

57:56.253 --> 57:58.020
I'm sorry, it's just...

57:58.022 --> 58:01.656
Look, we'll be out of here
in a second.

58:01.658 --> 58:04.725
- My charger's not charging.
- The power's out.

58:04.727 --> 58:07.194
- What does that mean?
- What does that usually mean?

58:07.196 --> 58:09.429
How are we going
to open cans now?

58:09.431 --> 58:12.071
Look, if you wanna come,
you can come, too, okay.

58:12.097 --> 58:13.232
Katie's fine with it;

58:13.234 --> 58:17.702
I asked. Andrea, you did call me, I
am not leaving here without him.

58:17.704 --> 58:21.205
Give me a break. -When you
are done with this, okay,

58:21.207 --> 58:22.739
call me and we'll work it out.

58:22.741 --> 58:25.742
- Richard! Get out of here, man!
- Guys!

58:25.744 --> 58:28.111
You know, I'm really glad that we could
talk about this here in front of everyone.

58:28.113 --> 58:30.746
He is fine. Ronnie, you're fine,
right?

58:30.748 --> 58:34.182
- You like mat, he's your buddy.
- Ronnie hates me.

58:34.184 --> 58:36.284
- What?
- No I don't.

58:36.286 --> 58:39.620
He wants to leave. Let the
little fucker switch teams.

58:43.391 --> 58:45.158
Can you sit up, please?

58:47.694 --> 58:50.262
If you are uncomfortable, you
come and talk to me about it,

58:50.264 --> 58:52.897
you do not go and call your dad
behind my back.

58:52.899 --> 58:56.233
<i>If you don't tell me you're uncomfortable,
I can't make you feel better.</i>

58:56.235 --> 59:00.536
- So you're an accountant?
- Uh, no, I'm a cpa, why?

59:00.538 --> 59:02.704
Did she say that
I was an accountant?

59:02.706 --> 59:05.239
- I'm a vp.
- Whoa, of what?

59:05.241 --> 59:09.676
Metal sheds, barns, farm buildings, prefab.
We call them "ultra-durable."

59:09.678 --> 59:11.811
I'd buy one.
Did you grow up on a farm?

59:11.813 --> 59:14.547
No. I've been thinking
about incorporating.

59:14.549 --> 59:17.716
- What do you think about that?
- What do you do?

59:17.718 --> 59:20.418
Freelance web design.

59:20.420 --> 59:24.321
- Are you asking me if that's what you do?
- No, that's what I do.

59:24.323 --> 59:29.426
- All there right on that laptop?
- Yeah.

59:29.428 --> 59:34.063
Well, how was your year?
Business? -Shut up.

59:34.065 --> 59:36.665
- Yeah, don't incorporate.
- No?

59:36.667 --> 59:40.368
No, it's fees, headaches. You know,
the money that you save on taxes

59:40.370 --> 59:45.438
isn't worth it if your revenue is, um...
Abbreviated.

59:45.440 --> 59:47.873
<i>Time to get out, Richard!</i>

59:47.875 --> 59:52.277
- So do you, do you, um, have a card?
- Yeah.

59:54.213 --> 59:55.613
Thanks. I got it.

01:00:00.017 --> 01:00:03.386
Of course you can.
Why are you asking?

01:00:03.388 --> 01:00:04.754
Bye, guys!

01:00:06.757 --> 01:00:09.492
Guys, Ronnie's saying bye.

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.796
- Take it easy.
- Bye.

01:00:25.105 --> 01:00:27.940
Gimme that! Give me the phone!

01:00:27.942 --> 01:00:31.910
- It's Farrah. Hello.
- Hello.

01:00:31.912 --> 01:00:35.479
- Hold on.
- Farrah!

01:00:35.481 --> 01:00:37.781
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:00:37.783 --> 01:00:39.182
Hello?

01:00:42.652 --> 01:00:44.185
Farrah!

01:00:57.465 --> 01:01:00.667
Hey... hey, I...

01:01:05.905 --> 01:01:07.939
<i>Enjoy your time with dad?</i>

01:01:07.941 --> 01:01:11.375
<i>I am not mad. Stay with him</i>
<i>as long as you want.</i>

01:01:15.913 --> 01:01:17.813
- I'm going to go.
- What?

01:01:17.815 --> 01:01:20.916
This is imposing.
It's really offensive and tacky.

01:01:20.918 --> 01:01:24.486
No, it's fine.
You can stay another night.

01:01:24.488 --> 01:01:27.288
I'll get some beer. -Yeah,
let's get some fucking beer.

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:28.922
No, you stay here.

01:02:02.556 --> 01:02:04.957
<i>I have to go to the restroom.</i>

01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:08.327
<i>Okay. Wash your hands</i>
<i>after. Don't talk to strangers.</i>

01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:09.895
<i>And don't call your dad</i>
<i>from a bodega.</i>

01:02:20.005 --> 01:02:21.405
Stop, man.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.541
Do you remember that, um,
hurricane myra?

01:02:25.543 --> 01:02:28.544
Was that a hurricane...
Myra... Meera?

01:02:28.546 --> 01:02:30.913
When we turned all the radios up
after the power went out

01:02:30.915 --> 01:02:33.415
so it would be all loud and freak
people out when it came back on?

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:34.549
Do you remember that?

01:02:37.986 --> 01:02:41.188
Where'd you go to buy beer, Albany?
Little beer run to Albany?

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:45.658
- Stop!
- Where's the fucking beer?

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.460
Where is my beer?

01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:51.996
<i>Hey, Andrea?</i>

01:02:53.865 --> 01:02:56.199
<i>- Andrea? Andrea, come here.</i>
- Farrah,

01:02:56.201 --> 01:02:59.235
please... just call me.

01:03:57.826 --> 01:04:00.928
Your brother's taking
a little evening nap.

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:03.830
He's got the biorhythms
of a lion.

01:04:03.832 --> 01:04:06.199
He has an enormous dick.

01:04:09.336 --> 01:04:12.171
- Oh, I'm drunker than I thought.
- No, no,

01:04:12.173 --> 01:04:16.808
I've heard it all before. In high
school they called him "rubber Buster."

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:20.311
Yeah. What side
does that come from?

01:04:20.313 --> 01:04:22.279
What an interesting question.

01:04:22.281 --> 01:04:27.784
Our dad has a medium,
medium-large penis, I think.

01:04:27.786 --> 01:04:30.186
Our mother's dick
is very average.

01:04:30.188 --> 01:04:32.588
And, um...

01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:36.792
Mine, oh it's exactly the same
length as mat's to the millimeter,

01:04:36.794 --> 01:04:42.530
but, uh, it's corkscrewed
and very thin, beet red,

01:04:42.532 --> 01:04:48.902
and it wriggles uncontrollably and
when I get aroused, it turns black.

01:04:51.372 --> 01:04:52.705
Gross.

01:05:29.575 --> 01:05:33.044
- Is this okay?
- Sure.

01:05:55.499 --> 01:05:59.835
Ronnie stares at you. -You said
that last night. I know. I get it.

01:05:59.837 --> 01:06:02.070
He stares at you a lot.

01:06:02.072 --> 01:06:06.607
I love being up early.
More than two hours of sunlight.

01:06:06.609 --> 01:06:08.775
Take it easy.

01:06:08.777 --> 01:06:10.443
Oh, crabby, I don't like to get
out of bed in the morning.

01:06:10.445 --> 01:06:12.711
I want to stay in bed with
my blankies.

01:06:12.713 --> 01:06:14.779
- Fuck off.
- -Fuck yourself!

01:06:14.781 --> 01:06:16.547
- You fuck yourself.
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:18.549
- No, fuck you!
- Fuck you in the eyes and...

01:06:18.551 --> 01:06:20.250
What do you guys wanna
do today?

01:06:20.252 --> 01:06:22.518
This is it. This is what
I'm doing today.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.853
- Jesus.
- -What?

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:29.023
- No, what?
- -You're like a fucking funnel.

01:06:29.025 --> 01:06:31.358
Like a fucking funeral pile.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.860
Funeral pyre?
Is that what you're trying to say?

01:06:33.862 --> 01:06:37.230
Fucking cumulonimbus
with fucking legs.

01:06:37.232 --> 01:06:40.766
- You got a hairball.
- Yeah, I gotta push it down.

01:06:40.768 --> 01:06:46.071
I gotta push it down... I got a hairball
in my throat, and I gotta push it down.

01:06:46.073 --> 01:06:48.540
I got to take a piss.
You guys cover me?

01:07:42.094 --> 01:07:44.762
She left me.

01:07:44.764 --> 01:07:47.464
- She left me.
- We know.

01:07:47.466 --> 01:07:52.101
Don't discuss me with him. -We don't
talk about you, just, come on, we know...

01:07:52.103 --> 01:07:54.803
- I didn't ask her to marry me.
- Oh.

01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:58.840
She started shaking.
I was just holding her hand.

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:01.481
So I let go of her
hand and I walked away.

01:08:01.507 --> 01:08:03.102
You were just scared.

01:08:08.049 --> 01:08:12.017
It was like vomit.
She told me that I was lost.

01:08:12.019 --> 01:08:15.487
That my eyes
don't give enough to her.

01:08:15.489 --> 01:08:19.390
That she doesn't know why
I'm so sad and angry.

01:08:19.392 --> 01:08:25.560
And that it's hurtful to be around.
Me. That she's dried up.

01:08:25.563 --> 01:08:29.897
Well, yes, yeah, I am sad!

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:34.834
I'm very sad! I'm very
fucking sad and angry!

01:08:34.836 --> 01:08:36.702
Why are you angry?
You don't seem so angry...

01:08:36.703 --> 01:08:39.037
I am. I'm enraged!
I don't know how else to be...

01:08:39.038 --> 01:08:41.805
That's silly! You're lucky that
you have someone who knows you

01:08:41.808 --> 01:08:44.241
- and wants to help you.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:08:44.243 --> 01:08:48.144
What did you say? -I grabbed her by
the shoulder and screamed at her.

01:08:48.145 --> 01:08:51.846
I called her terrible things.
I just wanted her to say yes!

01:08:51.849 --> 01:08:54.549
<i>Just yes, I will, I</i>
<i>will marry you!</i>

01:08:57.586 --> 01:09:00.587
So we gonna bomb this bridge
or what?

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:03.957
No!
I'll never see Ronnie again.

01:09:45.567 --> 01:09:51.104
This is insane! Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!

01:09:51.106 --> 01:09:54.640
- Jesus! Save me!
<i>- Shut the fuck up!</i>

01:09:54.642 --> 01:09:56.541
Save me!

01:10:01.646 --> 01:10:04.781
<i>Yeah, it's me. Still here.</i>

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:06.649
Do you love me?

01:10:06.651 --> 01:10:08.550
<i>Ok.</i>

01:10:08.552 --> 01:10:10.218
I love you.

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:13.921
I don't know...
Twenty-four hours.

01:10:13.923 --> 01:10:19.392
- We have food spoiling, so...
- Just tell me. Do you love me?

01:10:19.394 --> 01:10:21.627
I don't know.

01:10:21.629 --> 01:10:24.663
<i>- Should he just call me back?</i>
- Go away.

01:10:24.665 --> 01:10:27.632
Yes, yeah, sure, I'll wait.

01:10:27.634 --> 01:10:30.334
- You can be honest with me.
- Oh, thank you.

01:10:30.336 --> 01:10:36.239
You definitely need me. Right? You have
told me that you love me so many times...

01:10:36.241 --> 01:10:39.108
You told me our first week
together, that you loved me.

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:42.644
You told me when you were crying... crying
in the middle of the fucking night...

01:10:42.646 --> 01:10:46.681
Jesus Christ! Who needs this?! Who
needs this in their fucking life?!

01:10:46.683 --> 01:10:49.150
<i>Yeah, who needs this?</i>
<i>Who needs this?</i>

01:10:49.152 --> 01:10:51.485
<i>You wanna go? You wanna leave</i>
<i>my brother's apartment?</i>

01:10:51.487 --> 01:10:53.453
I can do what I want,
you piece of shit!

01:10:53.455 --> 01:10:55.588
Do you even have some
place to go at this point?

01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:57.590
- God, has he always been like this?
- I don't, I'm not...

01:10:57.592 --> 01:10:59.658
Have I always been like this,
huh?

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.793
Yes! For as long
as I've known you.

01:11:01.795 --> 01:11:04.662
For as long as I've known you,
and how long has that been, huh?

01:11:04.664 --> 01:11:06.797
I don't understand what that
even means.

01:11:06.799 --> 01:11:11.801
Okay, okay, come on, come on,
it's nap time. Come on.

01:11:11.803 --> 01:11:14.804
It's time to take a nap. -No. You're
not just going to lead me away.

01:11:14.806 --> 01:11:20.376
I'm all fucked out today. -I don't
think you can help acting like this.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:29.049
Look at your face. You want to get me off
with that fucking face, well fuck you.

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.885
Fuck you!

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.254
If you want to get me off
then stop.

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:36.890
Stop sweating and running and then
maybe I could fucking get off,

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:38.958
maybe I'll come like a fucking
spindletop.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.327
- Mat! What are you doing?!
- Right now!

01:11:41.329 --> 01:11:47.098
It never stops.
It just never fucking stops.

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:51.869
It never fucking stops.
It never fucking stops.

01:12:11.355 --> 01:12:12.922
Don't you dare.

01:12:19.862 --> 01:12:23.764
I'm sorry. I'm just showing
everybody everything today.

01:12:29.036 --> 01:12:30.903
Call me if you need to.

01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:52.557
Hey, whoa, whoa whoa.
Just fucking leave it, man.

01:12:52.559 --> 01:12:55.426
- I have to charge my phone.
- Just please fucking calm down.

01:13:20.418 --> 01:13:24.254
Hey. Hey, you're in my bed.

01:13:24.256 --> 01:13:28.324
Just kidding. I got food.
I got food from the arabs.

01:13:52.248 --> 01:13:57.851
- What's that?
- Chopped cheese. It's good.

01:13:57.853 --> 01:14:02.221
So. I went up to that bar
on 14th and Amsterdam.

01:14:02.223 --> 01:14:06.624
I think that place is a front
for something, don't you?

01:14:06.626 --> 01:14:11.361
- What do you want to do tonight?
- I don't know.

01:14:11.363 --> 01:14:17.433
What do you think of my lighting set-up?
Did you use all our candles?

01:14:17.435 --> 01:14:19.168
This is not good.

01:14:33.782 --> 01:14:36.750
<i>Mat, hi! This is your mom.</i>

01:14:36.752 --> 01:14:39.419
<i>When you can, please call me.</i>

01:14:39.421 --> 01:14:45.258
<i>Earl is apparently in some kind of bind
in his place in... Chinatown, I think?</i>

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:48.661
<i>I think it's some sort</i>
<i>of physical trouble.</i>

01:14:48.663 --> 01:14:50.629
<i>Needs a big strong man's help.</i>

01:14:50.631 --> 01:14:53.598
<i>I don't know if you're avoiding</i>
<i>us, or what.</i>

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.068
<i>We don't have much right now, but if
you need, like, a hundred dollars,</i>

01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:00.103
<i>we can probably scrape that up.</i>

01:15:00.105 --> 01:15:03.639
<i>Okay, love to hear from you.</i>
<i>Bye, mat.</i>

01:15:13.615 --> 01:15:15.748
- Going somewhere?
- Downtown.

01:15:18.084 --> 01:15:21.352
- Mom call you?
- Mmm, no.

01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:24.687
Okay.

01:16:31.718 --> 01:16:35.921
Hi. Did I call you?

01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:44.762
I've had some painkillers.

01:16:48.232 --> 01:16:50.066
That's okay.

01:16:50.068 --> 01:16:55.170
- Anyone else coming?
- Uh, no, it's just me.

01:16:55.172 --> 01:16:58.840
- Did you need something?
- You two doing alright?

01:16:58.842 --> 01:17:03.210
Oh, we're fine. He couldn't
make it. He's sorry.

01:17:03.212 --> 01:17:09.282
- I think Farrah is great, you know.
- Oh, uh, yeah.

01:17:09.284 --> 01:17:13.019
I think she knows
how to handle you.

01:17:13.021 --> 01:17:17.756
- Tricky business.
- Yeah. So...

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:21.759
My fucking fingers don't work
so I've had a little surgery.

01:17:21.761 --> 01:17:24.261
Oh, Jesus, Earl.

01:17:24.263 --> 01:17:28.631
- Does that hurt?
- Some things hurt, yeah.

01:17:30.367 --> 01:17:32.801
You want something?
I have pills, a few left.

01:17:32.803 --> 01:17:37.138
- Uh, maybe I'll have a drink?
- Oh, yeah, try that stuff.

01:17:39.741 --> 01:17:43.143
Did you need me to, uh,
lift something? -Yes.

01:17:48.448 --> 01:17:49.781
Oh, shit.

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:54.418
Fuck, Earl.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:57.421
It's your dog. Manzanera.

01:17:57.423 --> 01:18:00.223
Manzanera, I know.
I've absorbed it.

01:18:01.892 --> 01:18:03.692
I'll need a new one.

01:18:19.775 --> 01:18:23.477
I'm sorry I had a little
Susan-left-xanadu moment.

01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:31.317
It's very heavy, Earl.

01:18:32.485 --> 01:18:35.086
It's okay, forget about it.

01:18:35.088 --> 01:18:40.157
See those little clementines on the table?
You see where this is going.

01:19:05.483 --> 01:19:07.250
Oh, that's nice. Thanks.

01:19:15.291 --> 01:19:16.724
<i>Hello.</i>

01:19:19.794 --> 01:19:21.261
Hi.

01:19:22.563 --> 01:19:25.298
- Alan?
- Yeah?

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:30.835
Hi. Beatrice? Oh, you wouldn't
remember me.

01:19:30.837 --> 01:19:35.205
Maybe you would. I was
at Lindsay's wedding.

01:19:35.207 --> 01:19:38.708
Oh my God. You might
not remember that either.

01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:41.577
I was sort of a kid, too.

01:19:41.579 --> 01:19:44.212
Not really.

01:19:44.214 --> 01:19:46.713
This is definitely
the quietest I've seen him.

01:19:48.515 --> 01:19:52.517
- He's not "the Earl".
- Won't be gone for long.

01:19:52.519 --> 01:19:55.719
- I hope so.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

01:19:56.987 --> 01:19:59.655
- Okay, which?
- Just a tinkle.

01:19:59.657 --> 01:20:03.558
I can help. -No, it's okay.
I've done this before.

01:20:06.728 --> 01:20:09.863
You know those water pouches they
carry through the desert in westerns

01:20:09.865 --> 01:20:12.565
made out
of a buffalo's intestine?

01:20:12.567 --> 01:20:14.600
Middle of the desert,
some Indian shoots a hole

01:20:14.602 --> 01:20:17.703
in the pouch with his rifle
and it just leaks...

01:20:17.705 --> 01:20:21.673
And leaks and leaks,
and leaks and leaks...

01:20:37.923 --> 01:20:41.792
- Hey, where are you?
- The feast of San Gennaro.

01:20:41.794 --> 01:20:46.296
<i>- Where are you? Are you alive?</i>
- The feast of San Gennaro!

01:20:46.298 --> 01:20:50.199
<i>Jesus, that's awful.</i>
<i>Did you see Earl?</i>

01:20:50.201 --> 01:20:53.402
- Yeah, I saw Earl.
<i>- Is he still breathing?</i>

01:20:53.404 --> 01:20:55.470
Yeah, tell mom he's home,
I guess.

01:20:55.472 --> 01:20:57.805
<i>Michael's here. He's got some,</i>
<i>little... girl with him.</i>

01:20:57.807 --> 01:21:00.974
Michael's there? <i>-Yeah,
he will not stop talking.</i>

01:21:00.976 --> 01:21:03.209
<i>- Get over here. I'm dying over here.
</i> -I guess I can come.

01:21:03.211 --> 01:21:05.544
<i>- They're boring the fuck out of me.
</i> -Alright.

01:21:40.412 --> 01:21:43.781
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- Oh, God, are you okay?

01:21:43.783 --> 01:21:46.817
- Oh, yeah, it's fine, I'm fine.
- Fine? You don't look fine.

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:50.320
- It's really good to see you...
- You look like shit!

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:52.855
- Yeah, you look like shit.
- I'm fine, really...

01:21:52.857 --> 01:21:54.790
He's fine. He's totally fine.
He says he's fine, he's fine.

01:21:54.792 --> 01:22:01.362
I'm Alan.
She's sort of my... thing.

01:22:01.364 --> 01:22:04.298
It's a cash only bar
and I've got a credit card.

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:07.434
It's about the fluidity
of movement...

01:22:07.436 --> 01:22:09.803
Oh, Michael was telling me
a story about Farrah.

01:22:09.805 --> 01:22:12.605
She sounds so cool. She's
a dancer. That's exciting.

01:22:12.607 --> 01:22:15.808
She's an office manager
at a dance company.

01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:18.910
Even if you ignore the storytelling,
which is pretty primitive.

01:22:20.279 --> 01:22:22.546
- What do you do?
- I'm a painter.

01:22:22.548 --> 01:22:26.116
- So do you do like abstract stuff?
- I'm trying to.

01:22:26.118 --> 01:22:29.552
To be honest, I'm kind of
in a crisis right now.

01:22:29.554 --> 01:22:34.023
I want to get
past representation, but...

01:22:34.025 --> 01:22:36.410
I'm sorry, I thought you
were, like, in a crisis.

01:22:36.436 --> 01:22:37.793
I'm sure you'll get past it.

01:22:37.795 --> 01:22:40.729
Uh, did you know your
brother poured a beer on me?

01:22:40.731 --> 01:22:44.299
- What?
- You poured a beer on me.

01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:48.303
I hope you see someone about your issues.
Do you see someone?

01:22:48.305 --> 01:22:50.905
Don't do this. -You are
cruisin' for a bruisin'.

01:23:17.232 --> 01:23:19.366
What is this, some fantasy?
Doing coke off a hood?

01:23:19.368 --> 01:23:22.068
Why are you doing that?
You're snorting bugs and dirt.

01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:27.239
- He's a little drunk.
- I am a little drunk.

01:23:27.241 --> 01:23:29.507
But I'll tell you what. If you
stare at any asshole long enough,

01:23:29.509 --> 01:23:32.343
you're going to want to stick
your tongue in it.

01:23:32.345 --> 01:23:35.813
<i>You got a hairball. -I got a hairball
and I need someone to shove it down!</i>

01:23:44.021 --> 01:23:45.588
Get some of that.

01:23:46.623 --> 01:23:48.190
Babe!

01:24:36.972 --> 01:24:38.205
Fuck!

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:42.008
It's the wrong fucking stop!

01:25:18.145 --> 01:25:20.746
This is perfect.

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:24.583
This is, like, it's like magic.
This is exquisite.

01:25:24.585 --> 01:25:28.819
Don't describe what you're
doing while you're doing it.

01:25:28.821 --> 01:25:31.488
You're, like, killing it
with words.

01:25:49.172 --> 01:25:51.740
Hey, guys? Guys?

01:25:51.742 --> 01:25:54.809
Yeah, if you could hold for just a minute?
We're shooting something.

01:25:54.811 --> 01:25:57.778
- It'll just be a minute.
- What are you shooting?

01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:00.914
- It's a movie.
- Cool.

01:26:00.916 --> 01:26:03.650
<i>- Dave for Jo.</i>
- Go for Jonah.

01:26:03.652 --> 01:26:07.153
<i>- Lock it up. We're gonna roll.</i>
- Copy that. Lookin' it up.

01:26:07.155 --> 01:26:09.955
I got a couple of guys here
but we're holding. They're cool.

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:14.292
- That's cool, man. Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:18.929
Oh, hey, actually if you could do me a favor
and just hold off on lighting that up.

01:26:18.931 --> 01:26:20.931
What? There's fake fucking
fog everywhere.

01:26:20.933 --> 01:26:23.800
Yeah, but, it's just,
I'm allergic to cigarette smoke.

01:26:23.802 --> 01:26:27.069
He's allergic! -It makes me cough.
You'll hear me cough.

01:26:31.607 --> 01:26:34.642
It's actually illegal to smoke
cigarettes in New York City parks.

01:26:34.644 --> 01:26:37.277
Where the fuck are they?
I don't see anyone.

01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:39.112
They're there. It's just we don't
want anyone walking through.

01:26:39.114 --> 01:26:41.547
- There?!
- It's an important scene.

01:26:41.549 --> 01:26:46.885
Oh, shit, I see, mat... Oh, dude,
look, they're right there!

01:26:46.887 --> 01:26:50.388
<i>The thing is you need to be really quiet
because it's a really important scene.</i>

01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:53.724
Yeah, it's an important scene. You wanna
direct, don't you? You got vision!

01:26:53.726 --> 01:26:55.759
It's the real deal, guys.

01:26:58.696 --> 01:27:01.564
Yeah, we're really killing
ourselves for these guys.

01:27:01.566 --> 01:27:03.465
They're really
making it happen.

01:27:03.467 --> 01:27:05.366
I'm just ready to get
some sleep, you know?

01:27:05.368 --> 01:27:07.668
You're ready for some sleep?

01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:10.237
What? -You just said you're
ready for some sleep.

01:27:10.239 --> 01:27:12.906
What are you, four-years-old? You want
me to warm you up a bottle of milk?

01:27:12.908 --> 01:27:16.476
You want your "binky"?

01:27:16.478 --> 01:27:19.078
<i>All clear.</i>-Hey, you guys are good.
Thank you.

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:22.548
You've been patient.

01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:24.416
Have a good night.

01:27:24.418 --> 01:27:27.919
Thanks, man! You have
a good night, too.

01:27:32.490 --> 01:27:36.859
<i>Lock it up! We're gonna roll.</i>

01:27:36.861 --> 01:27:38.593
Goddammit.

01:27:41.496 --> 01:27:44.030
Okay, Roger, copy that!

01:27:44.032 --> 01:27:46.599
Let's take this hill, boys.
Grab your cocks!

01:27:46.601 --> 01:27:49.535
<i>Dave to Jonah. You there?</i>
<i>What was that?</i>

01:27:49.537 --> 01:27:52.593
"Hey guys, this is Jonah.
Some guys took my walkie.

01:27:52.619 --> 01:27:54.264
You gotta stop them! Guys!"

01:27:55.441 --> 01:27:57.175
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:07.650
Scotch!

01:28:10.053 --> 01:28:11.720
Scoooootch!

01:28:11.722 --> 01:28:12.987
<i>Good luck finding it.</i>

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:21.027
Oh, shit! That goddamn mouse!

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:22.761
That goddamn mouse!

01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:26.463
Oh, shit, I got it!

01:28:26.465 --> 01:28:29.432
- What?
- I got it in my hands!

01:28:29.434 --> 01:28:32.868
It's in my hands! Open the window!
Open the window!

01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:34.102
Open the window!

01:28:37.739 --> 01:28:40.107
- What're you going to do?
- What do you mean?

01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:42.909
- What're you going to do?
- What, you want to keep it?

01:28:42.911 --> 01:28:44.477
No!

01:28:52.485 --> 01:28:53.952
Hey, scotch!

01:28:53.954 --> 01:28:56.154
Scotch!

01:28:56.156 --> 01:28:57.654
Whiskey.

01:29:00.391 --> 01:29:03.059
<i>Hello?</i>

01:29:03.061 --> 01:29:06.462
<i>Whoever took this,</i>
<i>you want to return it, please?</i>

01:29:06.464 --> 01:29:10.565
<i>- Is anyone there?</i>
- There's nobody here.

01:29:10.567 --> 01:29:13.734
<i>- Hello? Hey.</i>
- There's nobody on this walkie.

01:29:13.736 --> 01:29:16.336
<i>- I know someone's there.</i>
- But hey,

01:29:16.338 --> 01:29:21.774
if you see that punk kid pa, who told
me I couldn't smoke a cigarette,

01:29:21.776 --> 01:29:25.544
tell him to pop his zits
and go suck a dick.

01:29:29.282 --> 01:29:32.651
<i>You're getting this pa</i>
<i>into a lot of trouble.</i>

01:29:32.653 --> 01:29:34.419
<i>He's very hurt.</i>

01:29:57.642 --> 01:29:59.542
Will she come back?

01:30:01.278 --> 01:30:03.545
I hadn't even thought about it.

01:30:06.448 --> 01:30:08.115
I miss her.

01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.187
I don't want to start over.

01:30:17.623 --> 01:30:19.256
I want to work on it.

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.794
I love her, you know?

01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:47.716
I truly do.

01:30:55.357 --> 01:31:00.360
Hey, hey, put some music on. Come on,
play some music from your phone.

01:31:00.362 --> 01:31:03.896
Let's stay up till
the sun rises. Come on!

01:31:03.898 --> 01:31:06.531
Let's stay up till
the sun... come on.

01:31:06.533 --> 01:31:09.267
Till the sun comes up!
Alan, come on!

01:32:37.488 --> 01:32:38.920
Good morning.

01:32:41.456 --> 01:32:43.957
You've got vomit...

01:32:43.959 --> 01:32:46.425
Oh! Jesus.

01:32:53.799 --> 01:32:57.201
It's jammed! It's jammed shut!

01:32:57.203 --> 01:33:00.103
<i>Would you turn the music off?</i>

01:33:04.975 --> 01:33:07.776
What, do you think Ronnie
did that? Did you do that?

01:33:07.778 --> 01:33:09.577
No I didn't do it.

01:33:16.784 --> 01:33:20.386
This is her goddamn natural
peanut butter.

01:33:20.388 --> 01:33:24.289
- She never picks up a fucking sponge.
- Calm down.

01:33:24.291 --> 01:33:26.424
Don't tell me to calm down.

01:33:40.839 --> 01:33:44.875
Here. Eat a fucking banana.

01:33:47.979 --> 01:33:49.979
Oh, charging, yeah.

01:33:51.915 --> 01:33:53.548
Come on, baby. Charging.

01:34:09.729 --> 01:34:11.162
Can you hand me that pen?

01:34:11.164 --> 01:34:12.495
Hello?

01:34:14.531 --> 01:34:15.731
What?

01:34:17.734 --> 01:34:18.934
Oh.

01:34:37.887 --> 01:34:40.455
You should have a blog, man.

01:34:40.457 --> 01:34:44.892
Or something. You are funny.

01:34:44.894 --> 01:34:47.527
From time to time.

01:34:47.529 --> 01:34:50.596
I do, grandpa.
Here, take a look.

01:34:55.267 --> 01:34:58.602
- Where do you get these pictures?
- Just online.

01:34:58.604 --> 01:35:02.538
"All you need to make a movie
is a gun and a head."

01:35:05.475 --> 01:35:07.274

01:35:09.543 --> 01:35:13.445
- Who was that calling? Andrea?
- Or not.

01:35:20.719 --> 01:35:24.821
"Building collapsed in Mumbai;
Scores missing".

01:35:24.823 --> 01:35:27.824
I'm going to take a shower.
I stink.

01:35:27.826 --> 01:35:34.430
Fucking peanut butter.
Fucking peanut butter.

01:35:34.432 --> 01:35:37.733
You know, if you wash some of
the dishes, the pile goes down.

01:35:37.735 --> 01:35:41.602
I'll look at the door if you want. How
did it lock from the inside anyway?

01:35:41.604 --> 01:35:43.170
It's kind of unsafe.

01:35:47.008 --> 01:35:49.476
Alright, what was that?

01:35:49.478 --> 01:35:52.846
A faberge egg, what do you think it was?
It was a glass. Jesus, I'll pay for it.

01:35:52.848 --> 01:35:56.416
It's more important to me
that you stop breaking things.

01:36:07.728 --> 01:36:09.562
<i>I'm ready to be a better man</i>
<i>for you.</i>

01:36:09.564 --> 01:36:12.364
I'm ready to be a better man
for you.

01:36:26.612 --> 01:36:29.513
I'm getting sick.
I've got phlegm.

01:36:33.617 --> 01:36:36.485
- Something funny over there?
- Just...

01:36:36.487 --> 01:36:41.021
You, being useful. It's, like,
a parody of usefulness.

01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:45.558
It's alright man. I'll do 'em.

01:36:47.661 --> 01:36:49.728
Be my guest.

01:37:02.808 --> 01:37:08.011
Why don't you just keep it? -It's finky,
even if you listen to it ironically.

01:37:08.013 --> 01:37:12.014
I didn't choose it ironically. -Oh, come
on, you listen to everything ironically.

01:37:12.016 --> 01:37:15.417
What did I see in there?
Is that Dennis Wilson?

01:37:15.419 --> 01:37:17.519
- You gave me that!
- Oh, I doubt that.

01:37:17.521 --> 01:37:20.522
Yes, you did. You said, "some
of this stuff is overwrought",

01:37:20.524 --> 01:37:23.191
"but he drowned in a puddle,
blah blah," which he didn't,

01:37:23.193 --> 01:37:25.193
by the way, he drowned
in a marina.

01:37:25.195 --> 01:37:27.862
No, he drowned in a puddle,
and who cares? He was miserable.

01:37:27.864 --> 01:37:31.632
No, it was a Marina. Did you know Longfellow's
wife died when her dress caught fire?

01:37:31.634 --> 01:37:36.636
It was a marina, he was diving. She was sealing
her children's hair in an envelope with hot wax

01:37:36.638 --> 01:37:40.806
when her dress caught fire and he tried
to wrap her up in a rug, but she died.

01:37:40.808 --> 01:37:45.510
Honestly... Oh, fuck! Ah! Shit!

01:37:45.512 --> 01:37:47.612
What is this?
Why is this shit...

01:37:47.614 --> 01:37:49.447
Fuck, I thought I got
everything out.

01:37:49.449 --> 01:37:51.849
Why are you such a useless
fuck-up?

01:37:51.851 --> 01:37:54.985
Like, the only time you go out of
your way is to fuck something up.

01:37:54.987 --> 01:37:57.854
- That's where your effort goes.
- What are you searching for?

01:37:57.856 --> 01:38:01.224
- Band-aids!
- I got band-aids.

01:38:01.226 --> 01:38:06.361
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Get the goddamn band-aids! Ah!

01:38:06.363 --> 01:38:10.565
Ah, fuck. The band-aids
are in the bathroom.

01:38:10.567 --> 01:38:13.501
Fuck!

01:38:13.503 --> 01:38:17.404
Goddammit!

01:38:17.406 --> 01:38:20.974
It's busted. You busted it. You're
like a fucking kodiak bear.

01:38:26.914 --> 01:38:30.449
Fuck! What?

01:38:48.701 --> 01:38:50.935
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:38:50.937 --> 01:38:54.838
Calm down! Hey. Calm down.

01:38:55.873 --> 01:38:57.506
You calm down.

01:38:57.508 --> 01:38:59.241
Fuck you.

01:39:03.746 --> 01:39:06.347
You got a hairball, bro!

01:39:06.349 --> 01:39:10.451
You don't even want me to articulate.
You're lucky I can't fucking string

01:39:10.453 --> 01:39:14.621
a sentence together to tell you about
yourself, your fucking zero, nothing self!

01:39:14.623 --> 01:39:18.332
Yeah? Yeah? You tell me you
want to be a better man?

01:39:18.358 --> 01:39:20.292
Is that true? Is that true?

01:39:20.294 --> 01:39:22.360
Well then whisper it
in my fucking ear, you fuck!

01:39:22.362 --> 01:39:25.262
Get on your knees
and propose it to me!

01:39:25.264 --> 01:39:27.731
I love how you act like I'm not
the only person,

01:39:27.733 --> 01:39:30.600
the only person, who'll put up
with your shit!

01:39:30.602 --> 01:39:35.871
Like I don't have the power to pull the fucking
plug out of your drain! You'd have no one!

01:39:35.873 --> 01:39:40.908
Yeah, that was articulate! Like,
three-quarters articulate!

01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:44.211
You're a marginal figure! -Where
are you going, you leaving?

01:39:44.213 --> 01:39:45.979
You running away?

01:39:45.981 --> 01:39:48.648
I'm calling a nuthouse, asshole,
for guess who! You!

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:50.950
Ah! Haha! Hah, good one!

01:39:55.654 --> 01:39:58.656
Ah, fuck!

01:40:08.466 --> 01:40:12.602
<i>When I recognize you in myself, when
I recognize parts of you in myself,</i>

01:40:12.604 --> 01:40:17.406
<i>I get sick. You're rotten, hopeless,
hypnagogic, you're just...</i>

01:40:20.476 --> 01:40:24.178
<i>You have a black</i>
<i>heart. You're half-awake.</i>

01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:27.481
<i>- What if I turned into you?</i>
<i>- And content to be...</i>

01:40:27.483 --> 01:40:30.851
<i>Half-awake. What if I turned into you?
I see dad.</i>

01:40:30.853 --> 01:40:35.288
<i>I see him in you, and I see him in me, and
everything you hate about him, you have!</i>

01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:40.192
<i>I don't want to reject you,</i>
<i>I don't want to cut you out,</i>

01:40:40.194 --> 01:40:43.227
<i>but all you do</i>
<i>is disappoint me, every time.</i>

01:40:44.963 --> 01:40:46.897
<i>It breaks my...</i>

01:41:04.014 --> 01:41:06.849
Here. Read it.

01:41:10.886 --> 01:41:15.355
What is this, something
you wrote for Farrah?

01:41:15.357 --> 01:41:19.359
- You spelled 'cum' with a 'u'.
- It says what I think of you.

01:41:19.361 --> 01:41:25.163
'Hypna-goggic'? 'Hypna-gaga'... I don't
even know what that fucking means.

01:41:25.165 --> 01:41:28.332
Mat!

01:41:28.334 --> 01:41:30.567
Mat, look at me!

01:41:35.305 --> 01:41:37.205
Mat.

01:41:44.345 --> 01:41:47.580
Mat. Mat!

01:42:26.185 --> 01:42:30.687
He and I shared a fire.
He made the fire.

01:42:30.689 --> 01:42:33.122
His English was terrible.

01:42:33.124 --> 01:42:37.726
Or French, all that crooked
Canadian French.

01:42:37.728 --> 01:42:41.262
And the ceilings were so tall,
it - it - it made it look like

01:42:41.264 --> 01:42:43.731
our reflections were spinning.

01:42:43.733 --> 01:42:49.969
Turning, like leaves
turning in the wind? And...

01:42:49.971 --> 01:42:53.939
I remembered you, crying.

01:43:04.216 --> 01:43:06.817
Huh. Look.

01:43:33.976 --> 01:43:37.344
You okay?

01:43:37.346 --> 01:43:43.750
You're stuffed up.
We might have some nasal stuff.

01:43:43.752 --> 01:43:47.453
I already looked.

01:43:47.455 --> 01:43:49.922
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go get some.

01:44:00.099 --> 01:44:03.668
- Taking your laptop?
- I don't know. Yeah.

01:44:22.354 --> 01:44:24.755
You hot in your coat?

01:44:29.293 --> 01:44:31.727
No. I'm fine.

01:44:34.564 --> 01:44:38.033
- You hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

01:44:41.203 --> 01:44:44.471
Make me a fucking sandwich.
