00:09.166 --> 00:13.166
Professor!
Professor! Professor!

00:13.250 --> 00:16.875
Professor! Professor!

01:14.125 --> 01:15.750
Tell me where you put the gold.

01:18.958 --> 01:19.833
I don't know.

01:21.250 --> 01:22.083
Asshole.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.375
I knew you would say that.

01:28.458 --> 01:29.791
Take a look.

01:31.708 --> 01:33.083
This is what you achieved.

01:40.041 --> 01:41.250
Look the kid in the eye!

01:41.333 --> 01:44.333
And tell him that,
on top of his countless list of crimes,

01:44.416 --> 01:46.625
now he's added the death of five soldiers.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.708
A life sentence. Tell him.

01:49.291 --> 01:50.625
Kid, how old are you?

01:51.208 --> 01:52.041
Twenty-three.

01:52.125 --> 01:55.833
Twenty-three years as a free man,
but not a single day more. Get used to it.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.125
All thanks to this guy.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.291
Same for Stockholm, huh? Look at her.

02:00.375 --> 02:02.375
Look at her, you piece of shit!

02:02.458 --> 02:06.541
By the time she gets out,
her son will be a 45-year-old man.

02:07.333 --> 02:11.708
Do you enjoy causing all that suffering,
you son of a bitch? You enjoy it?

02:12.541 --> 02:15.166
And there's Denver.
What are you gonna say to him?

02:15.250 --> 02:17.708
Tell him that he lost his son,
just like he lost his father?

02:17.791 --> 02:21.333
And both times
the same person was responsible, you!

02:23.625 --> 02:25.083
Did you actually love her?

02:25.166 --> 02:26.500
Well, look at her.

02:26.583 --> 02:30.125
Because I want you to remember that face
every single day you're in prison,

02:30.625 --> 02:32.958
thinking that if you'd only
just stayed away from her,

02:33.041 --> 02:38.125
she would still have a life,
a mother, a daughter.

02:38.208 --> 02:39.916
But now she's got nothing!

02:42.083 --> 02:45.125
And I don't give a shit what you're
planning to do with the fucking gold.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.083
Because I won't even try to find it.

02:54.583 --> 02:57.500
One of them will tell me where it is.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.166
Do you know why?

03:01.250 --> 03:04.958
Because whoever tells me
is gonna get a completely new life.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.500
Prison for life

03:09.041 --> 03:10.458
or life restored.

03:12.833 --> 03:17.791
One of you is gonna make today
the happiest day of your life.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.666
And of my life!

03:24.583 --> 03:27.583
I'm really glad you're so happy right now,
because the storm clouds are coming.

03:29.708 --> 03:31.208
You don't get it, Tamayo.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.625
What you believe to be
the end of the game…

03:36.666 --> 03:38.458
is actually only just the beginning.

03:41.166 --> 03:42.583
On your knees.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.083
The Professor was playing
the biggest poker game in history.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.625
And as crazy as it may seem,
he wasn't bluffing.

04:00.416 --> 04:02.666
Even though he didn't have any cards,

04:02.750 --> 04:06.625
and Alicia, who was looking for them,
didn't know where to start.

05:10.208 --> 05:14.208
PALAWAN, PHILIPPINES

05:14.291 --> 05:17.291
TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST HEIST

05:35.250 --> 05:37.750
After the heist
at the Royal Mint of Spain,

05:37.833 --> 05:40.875
the Professor spent his days haunted
by the guilt of his brother's death.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.916
He felt like he'd pushed Berlin away
from the Bank of Spain heist

05:47.000 --> 05:48.750
so he could pull his own job.

05:48.833 --> 05:49.875
And now he was dead.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.875
So, after sleepless nights,

05:53.958 --> 05:56.083
he found solace in an obsession,

05:57.208 --> 06:00.166
figuring out the impossible heist
at the Bank of Spain.

06:01.250 --> 06:04.250
Maybe Berlin and Palermo
knew how to get the gold out.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.458
But the real impossible challenge

06:08.750 --> 06:09.750
was something else.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.916
We know
how to get the gold out.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.208
But how do you get out

06:17.291 --> 06:19.000
without handcuffs?

06:19.500 --> 06:22.125
For a long period of time,
I've studied this.

06:22.208 --> 06:25.125
And the starting point is very simple.
Step one…

06:29.375 --> 06:30.541
we tell them the truth.

06:30.625 --> 06:33.625
We'll show them
how we got the gold out, with videos.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.708
And we'll do it from Pakistan.

06:43.458 --> 06:44.500
Shakir.

06:47.000 --> 06:47.875
In eight minutes,

06:48.583 --> 06:49.583
the show begins.

06:51.958 --> 06:53.125
STATEMENT FROM THE GANG

06:55.500 --> 06:58.666
To all of our passionate amigos
and fellow lovers of the heist genre

06:58.750 --> 07:02.000
as well as any curious onlookers, welcome.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.458
We're gonna explain to you

07:03.541 --> 07:05.958
how to get the gold out
of a state's national reserve.

07:06.041 --> 07:07.500
In this instance, Spain.

07:08.208 --> 07:11.750
So we invite you to come with us
as we dive into the fascinating journey

07:11.833 --> 07:14.041
through the heart
of the biggest heist of all time.

07:14.125 --> 07:17.041
Hundreds of servers are transmitting
that signal simultaneously.

07:17.125 --> 07:20.291
It's gone viral.
TV stations are already streaming it live.

07:20.375 --> 07:21.375
Breaking news.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.041
The robbers say they emptied
the gold vault of the Bank of Spain,

07:24.125 --> 07:26.958
and they're about to show us live
exactly how they did it.

07:27.041 --> 07:29.083
Spain may have lost its national reserve,

07:29.166 --> 07:31.333
which could lead to
unimaginable repercussions…

07:31.416 --> 07:34.333
…is that the vault would be
flooded with water. What's the solution?

07:34.416 --> 07:37.666
We weld this steel pipe to the vault
so that a diver can get in.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.791
They made it easy…
so everyone in Spain gets it.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.875
…one of the greatest heroes
of this heist. Bogotá, how are you?

07:43.958 --> 07:46.375
Do you have any idea
how many ingots you got out?

07:46.458 --> 07:49.541
Yes, I do… 7,258.

07:49.625 --> 07:52.458
Twelve kilos and a half.
600,000 euros each.

07:52.541 --> 07:55.416
That's about 4 billion, 355 million euros.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.083
-Lots of dough.
-Anything else you wanna say?

07:58.166 --> 08:00.708
-I'd like to say "hi" to my kids.
-Take it away, big guy.

08:00.791 --> 08:05.000
My incredible kids, Emilio in Venezuela,
Julián in Mexico City,

08:05.083 --> 08:07.541
Erik in Iceland. Hanna in Finland…

08:11.916 --> 08:13.625
Now it's airing on CNN.

08:13.708 --> 08:17.291
…Ivanna in Odessa. A kiss to all of you
from your papa.

08:17.375 --> 08:18.666
That was very moving.

08:18.750 --> 08:19.958
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

08:20.041 --> 08:23.708
if you wanna know how we managed to get
90 tons of gold out of the Bank of Spain,

08:23.791 --> 08:27.416
don't touch that dial.
New video coming up soon.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.333
NEW INSTALLMENTS COMING SOON

08:29.916 --> 08:31.291
This could be very bad for us.

08:31.375 --> 08:34.500
They managed to bypass
every security measure in place.

08:34.583 --> 08:37.166
Why are they telling us how they did it?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.583
Why now?
To pressure the Spanish government?

08:41.125 --> 08:42.875
You think I don't know what you're doing?

08:42.958 --> 08:44.875
You're trying to provoke
a financial crisis,

08:44.958 --> 08:48.083
get the country against the ropes,
and then blackmail me with all of that.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.958
Well, bad news for you, because I'm backed

08:50.041 --> 08:53.500
by the Bank of Central Europe.
They'll inject cash or buy debt if needed.

08:53.583 --> 08:56.333
And I can also completely halt
stock exchange trading.

08:56.416 --> 08:57.708
What do you think of that?

08:59.083 --> 09:02.541
You can take your little financial storm
and shove it up your ass.

09:03.708 --> 09:04.708
And step two?

09:10.541 --> 09:11.958
2. THE CASINO

09:12.041 --> 09:15.333
See, financial markets are pretty much
like a gigantic gambling house.

09:15.416 --> 09:16.708
You can bet on anything.

09:16.791 --> 09:19.041
On the New York Stock Exchange rising,
on wheat dropping,

09:19.125 --> 09:21.750
or on a country collapsing.

09:21.833 --> 09:25.000
You can place your bet and win
so much money, and it's perfectly legal.

09:25.083 --> 09:28.250
And what are we going to give
to all those funds

09:28.333 --> 09:32.166
and all those corporations desperately
in search of a victim to profit from?

09:38.125 --> 09:39.291
Assurance.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.666
When we tell them
the gold is outside of the bank,

09:44.500 --> 09:47.208
betting against Spain
will become the market's winning horse.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.750
And at the same time,
all that panic will drive the investors

09:50.833 --> 09:53.125
to massively sell out
Spanish debt and shares,

09:53.208 --> 09:54.333
which will then cause…

09:55.416 --> 09:58.291
the stock market to plummet,
and even more significantly,

09:59.500 --> 10:02.916
the risk premium
will skyrocket over 800 points.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.208
And what does that mean?

10:05.291 --> 10:08.625
That in a matter of hours, Spain won't
be able to get funds from the markets.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.708
It'll become insolvent
and therefore bankrupt.

10:10.791 --> 10:11.625
Exactly.

10:12.208 --> 10:14.375
It'll be like a domino effect,

10:14.458 --> 10:18.791
which will generate colossal pressure
on the government.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.541
And then we will be the only ones

10:25.625 --> 10:27.958
able to stop all of that
with a single gesture…

10:30.666 --> 10:32.041
giving back the gold.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.208
Uh, what?

10:35.916 --> 10:38.375
Uh, just making sure I got this all right.

10:38.875 --> 10:42.416
Are you telling me that my life depends
on placing a fucking bet, Professor?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.750
On the market tumbling or not tumbling?
What if it doesn't?

10:44.833 --> 10:47.708
It always happens this way, Denver.
Like it did in Greece.

10:47.791 --> 10:52.291
It's the very nature of the system.
It's designed to do that automatically.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.416
And it's predictable.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.500
You know what's predictable?
Going through a tunnel.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.958
Because you get in one side
and you get out the other.

10:59.041 --> 11:01.250
That's predictable.
But this is beyond our control.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.416
-Denver, stop--
-No, don't "Denver, stop" me.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.208
He can't play with our lives like that.
Let me tell you something.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.041
It's not gonna work, okay?

11:09.125 --> 11:11.708
You came in here
to make sure no one would talk

11:11.791 --> 11:13.750
so that you could keep blackmailing me.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.541
Great, now that we all know

11:16.625 --> 11:20.125
that this economic scheme
is nothing but a fucking hoax,

11:20.208 --> 11:21.416
do you know what I'm gonna do?

11:23.416 --> 11:26.125
I'm going to question all of you
one by one.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.750
And whoever doesn't tell me anything,

11:29.833 --> 11:32.125
they're gonna go out
through that fucking door,

11:32.208 --> 11:34.416
directly to a new life in a prison cell.

11:35.041 --> 11:36.041
Barefaced,

11:36.125 --> 11:40.125
with all those TV cameras on you,
so that there's no going back.

11:40.208 --> 11:41.833
Each one you take out,

11:41.916 --> 11:43.375
each person, I swear to you,

11:43.458 --> 11:46.208
equals ten tons of gold
you'll never recover.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.375
Son of a bitch.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.375
I told you that was a game
you couldn't play.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.958
-Denver, shut up. The game is on.
-"Shut up"?

11:58.041 --> 11:59.708
-Denver.
-What?

11:59.791 --> 12:00.791
Shut up.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.125
Shut up? Shut up?

12:03.208 --> 12:05.541
We're all here right now,
all on our knees,

12:05.625 --> 12:08.625
with a fucking rifle against our necks!

12:08.708 --> 12:10.625
-Because we listened to this psycho!
-Shut up!

12:10.708 --> 12:12.541
-I won't shut up!
-Denver, shut the fuck up!

12:18.583 --> 12:21.041
Take those two and separate them
from the rest of the gang.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.250
Denver, you're going to be the first one.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.333
Denver. Remember what I said!

12:32.416 --> 12:35.375
Someone stole the gold.
If anyone finds out, it's over.

12:36.208 --> 12:39.000
I swear on our son
that I'll get you out of here.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.708
Denver, don't do anything.

12:41.708 --> 12:42.958
Denver, listen to me.

12:43.041 --> 12:46.083
Denver, remember what I told you!

12:51.625 --> 12:53.875
And while the gang
was up against the ropes…

12:53.958 --> 12:56.541
This pump is used
to suck aggregate from the sea bottom.

12:57.125 --> 13:00.208
With this much driving force,
they could send all the gold upstream.

13:00.291 --> 13:03.291
…Ángel thought he'd finally found
the right thread to pull.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.958
We've been looking
in the wrong direction the entire time.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.291
But that was just part
of Plan Tom Thumb.

13:08.375 --> 13:11.583
I need eight men at the door,
immediately, now. We're leaving.

13:12.791 --> 13:16.541
Where the fuck do you hide
90 tons of gold, Benjamín?

13:16.625 --> 13:18.250
In a… In a forest.

13:18.833 --> 13:22.125
Or in the desert.
Or an abandoned place no one knows about.

13:22.625 --> 13:26.125
We need to think like them,
like an engineer, a graduate of MIT.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.208
Minimize the risks.

13:29.916 --> 13:33.208
And to minimize the risks,
you have to make sure that no moron

13:33.291 --> 13:36.583
will come around looking for coins
with a metal detector someday.

13:36.666 --> 13:38.291
And there's only one way to do that,

13:38.375 --> 13:39.625
limiting the access…

13:40.500 --> 13:41.708
A private property.

13:42.291 --> 13:43.291
Exactly.

13:43.375 --> 13:47.041
A private property, which by the way needs
to be close enough to the stormwater tank.

13:47.833 --> 13:50.208
These people knew the plan perfectly,

13:50.291 --> 13:51.791
but with Berlin dead,

13:51.875 --> 13:55.208
they didn't even imagine
the heist would ever take place, though.

13:57.208 --> 13:58.041
Holy shit!

13:59.083 --> 14:01.458
They started to act
the moment the heist began.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.458
We have to look for any land
that was bought in the last five days.

14:04.541 --> 14:06.916
All roads will lead to the same place.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.291
The land property records.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.333
Then we need to go in fully armed.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.125
This could be your new identity, Denver.

14:23.583 --> 14:24.541
And there's more.

14:25.833 --> 14:29.333
Three million euros for a new start,
financial freedom.

14:29.416 --> 14:32.916
You could buy a house with a jacuzzi,
throw some nice little parties…

14:33.000 --> 14:34.833
In the country of your choosing.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.708
And also a lifetime allowance
of 25,000 euros a month

14:38.791 --> 14:41.000
at the expense of the Government of Spain.

14:43.166 --> 14:45.666
A premium pension.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.416
What do you think?

14:50.875 --> 14:52.958
And, uh, what happens to my family?

14:56.708 --> 14:59.375
We can make an exception.
Two for one.

14:59.958 --> 15:01.416
If you tell me where the gold is,

15:01.500 --> 15:04.166
Stockholm, you, and your kid,
who's hiding out there somewhere,

15:04.250 --> 15:06.375
will be able to start from zero.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.416
Okay, but I don't know
where to find the gold.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.500
It's the truth. I don't know.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.750
Look, Denver, you know something,
and I need an informer

15:18.833 --> 15:20.583
who can give me
all the details of the plan.

15:20.666 --> 15:23.666
I'll find the gold later,
but you'll get your freedom anyway.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.416
I know it's fucking tough,

15:27.500 --> 15:30.333
but you don't even have to
say it out loud if you don't want to.

15:33.291 --> 15:34.541
All you have to do

15:35.166 --> 15:36.708
is write down what it is

15:36.791 --> 15:38.916
that Raquel Murillo
doesn't want you to say.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.000
Just a simple answer

15:58.500 --> 16:00.375
for a life of freedom.

16:05.250 --> 16:08.208
Hm. A fucking life of freedom.

16:20.875 --> 16:24.541
"Add the fingers on your hand
to the toes on your feet…"

16:24.625 --> 16:27.166
"Plus your cock and your balls,
it adds up to 23."

16:27.250 --> 16:29.500
You can
just stick that in your GPS

16:29.583 --> 16:31.416
and it'll take you directly to the gold.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.750
-Get out of here.
-Fine by me.

16:35.416 --> 16:38.833
That was three million. Make sure
it's cash. I don't like going to the ATM.

16:38.916 --> 16:39.791
Get him out!

16:39.875 --> 16:42.333
I want a house
in the Dominican Republic! Got it?!

17:42.625 --> 17:44.000
I love you.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.041
Come on.

18:25.125 --> 18:26.583
This will be your fate.

18:27.083 --> 18:30.625
I'll give you a moment to picture it
and I'll come back for the next person.

18:44.041 --> 18:47.291
MADRID, FIVE YEARS EARLIER

18:56.875 --> 18:59.375
Sergio, I don't understand.
Why are you planning a heist?

19:01.416 --> 19:03.750
My dad I can understand,
you know?

19:03.833 --> 19:05.541
But you, with all that
knowledge you have--

19:10.541 --> 19:12.125
-Thank you.
-Thanks so much.

19:12.208 --> 19:13.750
Why does it suit me?

19:13.833 --> 19:15.625
You're a textbook hedonist.

19:16.625 --> 19:21.208
You need your time to, uh,
to enjoy art, uh, love,

19:22.041 --> 19:25.583
traveling… with all that,
you wouldn't have time to work.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.541
Enjoying life doesn't suit me. I get it.

19:27.625 --> 19:31.041
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What we do is far more than just work.

19:31.125 --> 19:34.416
It's a tradition in our family.
It's our heritage.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.250
It's, uh, really important
that you never forget that.

19:40.916 --> 19:43.791
There are families of doctors, right?
Families of lawyers.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.916
Families who honor a profession.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.708
Your grandfather
inaugurated our family line.

19:53.958 --> 19:55.250
How did it go in Denmark?

19:55.333 --> 19:58.750
The exchange was exquisite.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.083
Where were you when Grandpa was killed?

20:06.250 --> 20:07.333
In the kitchen.

20:07.833 --> 20:11.708
They said on the radio
that a robber, uh, had been shot down.

20:11.791 --> 20:13.333
Your grandma froze.

20:14.041 --> 20:16.875
She left the fridge door completely open.

20:20.416 --> 20:21.250
Suddenly,

20:23.125 --> 20:24.583
she came and hugged me.

20:27.541 --> 20:30.208
That's when I knew
my papa was that robber.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.291
Then, the fridge started to beep.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.583
Did you find out like that as well?

20:42.166 --> 20:43.208
No.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.708
Well, sure you did, Sergio.
You were there.

20:45.791 --> 20:47.166
You'd just been discharged.

20:47.250 --> 20:50.333
In fact, it was one of the few times
you weren't in the hospital.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.583
I was there, but I already knew.

20:56.166 --> 20:57.083
What?

20:58.708 --> 21:00.125
A noise woke me up that morning.

21:01.541 --> 21:03.541
I jumped out of bed,
in my pajamas.

21:03.625 --> 21:07.166
I went to the window, the one that was
facing the courtyard, and I saw Papa.

21:08.791 --> 21:11.208
He was loading the trunk.
I thought, "It's the fishing gear."

21:13.166 --> 21:15.375
Remember he promised,
when I got out of the hospital,

21:15.458 --> 21:16.375
that we'd go fishing?

21:18.958 --> 21:21.875
So I got dressed and chased after him.

21:21.958 --> 21:24.625
I ran down the stairs.

21:24.708 --> 21:25.625
Papa!

21:28.500 --> 21:30.250
I missed him by three seconds.

21:30.958 --> 21:32.291
By three seconds!

21:38.333 --> 21:40.125
So then I grabbed your bicycle.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.375
And I began pedaling as fast as I could.

21:49.458 --> 21:50.416
Papa!

21:50.916 --> 21:53.375
I saw the car in the distance.
I was getting closer.

21:53.458 --> 21:57.041
He stopped at a traffic light,
but as I was about to reach him,

21:58.166 --> 21:59.333
the light turned green.

22:02.416 --> 22:03.500
Papa!

22:03.583 --> 22:04.625
He kept escaping me.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.541
And I saw him in the distance.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.500
He was changing cars.

22:25.250 --> 22:27.041
And after five, six minutes…

22:30.000 --> 22:32.083
I saw the car parked without him in it.

22:33.208 --> 22:34.166
And then…

22:36.708 --> 22:38.083
…I heard two gunshots.

22:40.958 --> 22:41.875
I was scared to death.

22:44.416 --> 22:47.416
And then I saw Papa
coming out of the bank.

22:47.916 --> 22:49.083
-Don't move!
-Freeze!

22:49.583 --> 22:51.083
On the ground, now!

22:51.583 --> 22:52.875
And he saw me.

23:02.666 --> 23:05.125
Then they started yelling at him,
"On your knees!"

23:05.208 --> 23:07.333
-On your knees!
-"On your knees."

23:07.416 --> 23:09.916
On your knees!
Get on the ground right now!

23:10.000 --> 23:11.291
Right now! On the ground!

23:13.041 --> 23:14.541
He didn't do it, Andrés.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.958
Because he was looking at me.

23:25.916 --> 23:26.833
And…

23:49.083 --> 23:54.125
BANK OF SPAIN

24:12.208 --> 24:13.416
That's how I found out.

24:15.833 --> 24:17.208
And what did you do?

24:17.791 --> 24:20.208
Nothing. I just… went home.

24:21.208 --> 24:23.333
Sergio, I… I was there when you got home.

24:23.416 --> 24:24.291
Yeah.

24:24.958 --> 24:26.625
Why didn't you say anything?

24:28.625 --> 24:30.916
Well, because for me, it was like a movie.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.250
Papa would always tell stories about…

24:33.333 --> 24:35.791
about heists and all that
as if they were a movie.

24:37.500 --> 24:38.333
And, uh,

24:39.333 --> 24:41.708
while I was pedaling
on the way home, I thought…

24:43.583 --> 24:44.750
"This is just a movie."

24:45.916 --> 24:47.416
"And if I don't say anything,

24:49.041 --> 24:50.000
it'll always be."

24:53.500 --> 24:55.416
And it worked. It worked,

24:56.583 --> 24:58.041
until I heard the radio.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.750
So when you ask me
why I choose to plan the heists,

25:03.833 --> 25:04.875
the answer is simple.

25:05.666 --> 25:06.833
To talk to him.

25:11.125 --> 25:14.791
The night before, he told me
about his dream to rob the Royal Mint.

25:14.875 --> 25:18.208
And we both
laughed our asses off.

25:18.291 --> 25:22.416
"Can you imagine
a machine that can make money?"

25:27.083 --> 25:28.958
Now I'm the one who's narrating movies.

25:29.041 --> 25:31.875
I ask him, "Papa, what do you think?
How's this or that part of the plan?"

25:31.958 --> 25:34.625
Um… "Do you see any weak points?"

25:38.625 --> 25:39.833
We talk a lot.

25:47.916 --> 25:50.291
More often than I talk
to any other living person.

26:11.666 --> 26:14.208
-Tell me.
-We found the Professor's base.

26:14.291 --> 26:17.708
No sign of the gold.
They burned everything before escaping.

26:17.791 --> 26:19.708
Fuck, Ángel.
Can you give me some good news?

26:19.791 --> 26:22.166
Looks like they melted the gold
back into ingots

26:22.250 --> 26:24.416
maybe so it's easier to carry.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.666
And Colonel, we can
probably trace those trucks.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.000
Go talk to Interpol.

26:29.083 --> 26:30.666
We need to issue an international warrant

26:30.750 --> 26:32.541
and get all those
European satellites looking.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.000
We're going to find them, Ángel.

26:35.083 --> 26:35.916
Okay.

26:36.333 --> 26:39.291
PASAIA PORT, 3:07 A.M.

26:39.791 --> 26:43.916
Those trucks were the breadcrumbs
Marseille was leaving on his path.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.458
Traces on a road that wasn't taken.
Of a loot that wasn't there

26:47.541 --> 26:50.208
whose only purpose
was to drive the police crazy.

27:17.291 --> 27:18.166
And so?

27:25.291 --> 27:27.625
We don't have the backing
of the Bank of Central Europe.

27:29.541 --> 27:31.250
They're very skeptical…

27:33.416 --> 27:35.333
about how to manage the crisis.

27:37.041 --> 27:39.083
And what does… does that mean?

27:39.166 --> 27:40.000
Minister?

27:44.958 --> 27:46.666
They'll let us fall apart.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.708
The stock market
plummeting 14% today in three hours

27:51.291 --> 27:52.500
will be a joke

27:53.375 --> 27:55.875
compared to what will happen
at nine in the morning

27:56.958 --> 27:58.375
when the markets open.

27:59.875 --> 28:02.000
You've got the mastermind
of the operation in there,

28:02.083 --> 28:04.583
on his knees, beaten, and handcuffed.

28:04.666 --> 28:06.666
Tell me what the fuck
you're doing in here!

28:15.708 --> 28:17.125
You, get out of here.

28:20.833 --> 28:21.916
You son of a bitch!

28:22.625 --> 28:23.541
No!

28:24.458 --> 28:25.875
You know, you're wrong about me.

28:25.958 --> 28:29.291
Tamayo, if you cross that red line,
there's no turning back.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.041
You're saying that to me?

28:32.125 --> 28:33.458
Watch this.

28:38.125 --> 28:41.375
I need you to understand one thing,
or I'll smash that little head of yours.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.250
You won't have an autopsy.

28:43.333 --> 28:46.291
I'll tear you apart, punch after punch
in front of your girlfriend.

28:46.375 --> 28:50.291
And I won't stop until you tell me
where the gold is or until you die

28:50.375 --> 28:52.250
because either I win or no one does.

28:52.916 --> 28:54.583
Stop!

29:00.416 --> 29:02.833
And what if you're wrong
about what it means to "win"?

29:04.458 --> 29:08.250
Picture yourself
a few months from now, at home,

29:08.833 --> 29:11.625
listening to the unemployment figures,
the debt maturities.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.208
The whole country

29:14.041 --> 29:17.333
plunging into bankruptcy,
into an unprecedented crisis,

29:17.416 --> 29:19.000
into absolute chaos.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.458
Which Tamayo would have won more?

29:23.291 --> 29:26.791
The one who arrested us?
The one who killed us and lost the gold?

29:27.500 --> 29:31.541
Or the one who got it back and stopped
the biggest financial collapse in history?

29:35.541 --> 29:36.375
Listen to me.

29:38.208 --> 29:39.041
Tamayo…

29:40.083 --> 29:42.708
I know you'll struggle to grasp this.
I really do.

29:44.625 --> 29:47.166
But in this moment,
we both only have one option.

29:47.833 --> 29:48.666
Just one.

29:49.791 --> 29:51.166
Either we both win…

29:53.458 --> 29:54.458
or we both lose.

30:05.791 --> 30:08.208
I don't know where the gold is.
I don't know.

30:09.916 --> 30:12.333
I don't. Lisbon doesn't.
No one in the gang does.

30:14.375 --> 30:15.583
What did you expect?

30:16.291 --> 30:18.083
You think I'd be here
with that information?

30:18.166 --> 30:19.291
I'd never do that.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.916
Tamayo, you bury people in the desert.

30:23.833 --> 30:26.916
Sooner or later, you would've
squeezed it out of one of us.

30:28.875 --> 30:32.500
I couldn't let anyone into the bank
with that information, not even myself.

30:36.458 --> 30:38.041
That's our firewall.

30:41.125 --> 30:42.666
The gold is already out.

30:47.708 --> 30:48.833
It's on the move.

30:57.166 --> 31:00.708
So this is the grand finale,
the last abracadabra, huh?

31:02.083 --> 31:05.041
Ninety tons of gold somewhere out there…

31:07.125 --> 31:08.750
dancing gracefully.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.208
But you are still right about one thing.

31:24.916 --> 31:26.750
I don't really know how I can win.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.333
So maybe both of us have to lose.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.791
Tamayo, you and I are insignificant

31:43.875 --> 31:45.916
compared to the impending
economic tsunami.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.541
Absolutely insignificant.

31:48.750 --> 31:51.041
Tamayo, you know there's only one way out.

31:51.125 --> 31:52.041
I know you do.

32:06.375 --> 32:09.541
LAND REGISTRY, 6:50 A.M.

32:20.541 --> 32:21.375
Buenos días.

32:22.250 --> 32:23.958
The auction has begun.

32:24.041 --> 32:24.875
BACK IN 2 HOURS

32:24.958 --> 32:27.833
Who's been working here
for longer than 15 years?

32:28.708 --> 32:29.791
Longer than 20?

32:30.708 --> 32:32.000
Twenty-two?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
And sold.

32:43.583 --> 32:44.625
Would you come with me?

32:45.125 --> 32:46.416
Today you'll be able to enjoy

32:46.500 --> 32:48.708
the kind of thing
you've been hearing all over the news,

32:48.791 --> 32:50.333
cooperation with an armed group.

32:50.416 --> 32:53.000
You won't be charged though
because we're forcing you.

32:53.083 --> 32:54.166
Thrilling, huh?

32:54.250 --> 32:55.125
Oh. Yeah.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.625
Everyone was after the gold,
like a scavenger hunt.

32:59.708 --> 33:03.250
Sierra knew that the gold was
the only way she could avoid jail.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.250
It's here.

33:05.333 --> 33:06.958
And Ángel was scrambling.

33:07.041 --> 33:10.750
He took the bait so hard
the fishhook was almost in his stomach.

33:11.916 --> 33:12.875
Tell me!

33:12.958 --> 33:16.208
Colonel, we've tracked down the trucks.
They're heading north, on Route 1.

33:16.291 --> 33:17.708
They're at the Pasaia port.

33:17.791 --> 33:19.958
The fucking Professor
won't say a word, Ángel.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.416
Get your ass there right now.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.625
I'm getting on a helicopter.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

33:32.208 --> 33:33.166
Sergio.

33:35.750 --> 33:36.750
Sergio.

33:38.375 --> 33:39.291
Does it hurt?

33:39.375 --> 33:40.291
What?

33:41.291 --> 33:44.583
-Does it hurt? You're bleeding.
-Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

33:45.083 --> 33:47.000
I'm… I'm really good. Really good.

33:47.083 --> 33:48.708
I took a couple of punches, but…

33:50.083 --> 33:51.500
you should see the other guy.

33:53.041 --> 33:55.125
If he stayed here
for two more minutes, I mean--

33:55.208 --> 33:57.083
-You'd kick his ass.
-I'd kick his ass.

34:00.291 --> 34:01.708
I have no doubt.

34:06.666 --> 34:08.000
I'm glad to hear that.

34:09.750 --> 34:13.333
If I'm not wrong, the last time we talked,
you called me a coward or something.

34:16.208 --> 34:18.041
You yelled at me to shut up.

34:18.666 --> 34:19.625
Yeah, I did.

34:20.916 --> 34:22.500
We argue a lot during heists.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.125
Mm. Mm-hmm.

34:24.916 --> 34:26.333
Maybe we should give it up.

34:29.041 --> 34:31.875
Mm-mm. It's not like canceling
your library membership. No, no, no.

34:31.958 --> 34:34.458
You need money.

34:35.291 --> 34:37.916
Not to be on the most wanted list
in 130 countries…

34:38.000 --> 34:39.458
Oh, and a new identity.

34:40.666 --> 34:42.291
And right now, my face

34:42.916 --> 34:45.416
is in no condition for a passport picture.

34:48.291 --> 34:50.500
More importantly, you don't want to stop.

34:53.625 --> 34:54.708
Let me ask you…

34:56.000 --> 34:57.958
After the Royal Mint of Spain heist,

34:58.041 --> 35:00.791
how long did it take you
to start thinking of this one?

35:04.958 --> 35:05.791
Hm.

35:07.916 --> 35:09.000
Forty-eight hours.

35:12.833 --> 35:14.166
Maybe 24.

35:18.291 --> 35:19.708
I owed it to my brother.

35:21.291 --> 35:22.833
Sure, sure, of course, yeah.

35:22.916 --> 35:24.791
Your tribute to dead relatives.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.750
Some people throw ashes into the sea,

35:29.416 --> 35:31.833
others bring flowers to the cemetery…

35:33.791 --> 35:35.791
You rob the national reserve.

35:37.208 --> 35:38.291
But you know what?

35:39.083 --> 35:40.916
You don't do it for your father

35:42.666 --> 35:43.750
or for your brother.

35:45.958 --> 35:47.291
You do it for you.

35:58.958 --> 36:02.458
Um, no, it's my way
of communicating with them.

36:04.333 --> 36:05.625
I mean, how? A Ouija board?

36:06.291 --> 36:07.625
No.

36:10.416 --> 36:12.083
That's just what you tell yourself.

36:12.666 --> 36:15.291
It's easier to say
than to take off your mask.

36:16.833 --> 36:18.833
Because I know you love masks.

36:22.791 --> 36:24.458
You're always…

36:25.000 --> 36:27.333
playing the role of the nerd,

36:28.125 --> 36:31.541
with your glasses, origami…

36:32.583 --> 36:33.875
And in reality…

36:34.958 --> 36:36.500
In reality, you…

36:37.208 --> 36:39.416
walked into the bank with the confidence

36:39.500 --> 36:42.666
of someone that's about to
arm-wrestle the government.

36:45.791 --> 36:49.291
You are the magic trick, Sergio.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.125
Dressed like Clark Kent.

36:56.041 --> 36:58.208
But it's about time you take it off

36:59.666 --> 37:01.583
and accept who you really are.

37:01.666 --> 37:03.000
Will you marry me?

37:07.500 --> 37:09.041
Was it a better proposal this time?

37:09.125 --> 37:10.625
-Fuck. I did it again, I…
-No--

37:10.708 --> 37:12.458
I suddenly spit it out
like at the motor home.

37:12.541 --> 37:14.791
-I just… I can't believe it…
-No. No.

37:14.875 --> 37:16.250
It was good. Yeah.

37:22.083 --> 37:22.916
And?

37:26.125 --> 37:26.958
I will.

37:27.583 --> 37:28.500
I'll do it.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.208
Let's win this.

37:56.583 --> 37:59.500
No matter how tough things get,
they still love each other.

38:03.416 --> 38:07.583
A total of 612 purchases
have gone through in the last five days.

38:08.083 --> 38:12.541
Mr. Anselmo Bueno Gutiérrez…
He sold an urban plot--

38:12.625 --> 38:15.291
Wait, hold on a sec. Let's keep it short.

38:16.208 --> 38:19.083
Give me just the ones bought in cash,
no mortgage.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.125
That does narrow down my search.

38:21.208 --> 38:22.791
But would you please…

38:22.875 --> 38:25.291
would you please
stop pointing a gun at me?

38:25.375 --> 38:27.583
-Benjamín…
-Oops, sorry.

38:30.625 --> 38:36.083
Here, Doña María Flores González
purchased a lot in Robledo de Chavela.

38:36.166 --> 38:40.958
The seller is Rosario Pineda Hernández,
the lot comprising an area of 3,189…

38:41.041 --> 38:45.416
While Alicia Sierra realized she
was running out of time to find the gold,

38:45.500 --> 38:48.041
the police were about to have an epiphany.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.625
PLAN TOM THUMB

38:49.708 --> 38:53.625
Our man in the shadows
will scatter breadcrumbs along his path.

38:53.708 --> 38:58.041
Marseille, go to the stormwater tank.
When you get there, launch Plan Tom Thumb.

38:59.541 --> 39:02.125
At 23:07 on the previous night,

39:02.208 --> 39:05.000
they prepared a crime scene
worthy of an Oscar.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.750
The red trucks then
transported their fake loot.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.916
And at 8:10 in the morning,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.750
Ángel thought he found
something extraordinary.

39:14.833 --> 39:17.166
Colonel, I've got some footage
of a group of guys

39:17.250 --> 39:19.250
loading pallets from trucks
onto a fishing boat.

39:19.333 --> 39:21.833
-What? A fishing boat?
-Breadcrumbs in the sea.

39:21.916 --> 39:24.291
In order to follow them,
they'll need satellites,

39:24.375 --> 39:26.833
so they'll reach out
to NATO for help, to Interpol.

39:26.916 --> 39:29.875
They'll scan all the traffic cameras
in Spain. And all that…

39:31.666 --> 39:32.708
will make them confident.

39:32.791 --> 39:34.250
Could you zoom in?

39:34.333 --> 39:36.291
Zoom in here, on the main screen.

39:37.125 --> 39:37.958
Bastards.

39:38.041 --> 39:41.500
They're loading the gold onto a boat.

39:41.583 --> 39:43.833
Because the harder it is
to follow something

39:43.916 --> 39:45.625
and the more it takes to reach it,

39:45.708 --> 39:49.333
the more you believe
that what you're going after is real.

39:59.458 --> 40:01.500
That's why Tamayo didn't hesitate.

40:01.583 --> 40:05.083
The cornerstone of the investigation
was the Virgen del Carmen IV,

40:05.875 --> 40:09.208
a vessel used for anchovy fishing
in the Cantabrian Sea.

40:10.583 --> 40:12.791
Ángel, where the fuck did that boat go?

40:12.875 --> 40:15.666
I don't know, Colonel.
We lost their GPS signal.

40:15.750 --> 40:18.833
Once they have
absolutely no idea where we're going,

40:18.916 --> 40:21.333
they'll discover another turn of events.

40:22.875 --> 40:24.416
A random kidnapping at sea.

40:25.666 --> 40:28.833
Colonel, the boat showed up in Cantabria,
100 miles away.

40:28.916 --> 40:31.208
The captain and the crew
were tied up in the cabins.

40:31.291 --> 40:32.833
I'm on my way there on the helicopter.

40:32.916 --> 40:35.041
What? What do you mean, "tied up"?

40:35.125 --> 40:38.000
Because we have to make sure
lots of things are happening

40:38.083 --> 40:40.208
so that they won't have any time to think.

40:42.166 --> 40:43.750
Okay, then, tell me what happened.

40:43.833 --> 40:47.541
Well, uh, we were out there sailing
for about three or four hours.

40:47.625 --> 40:50.708
After that, we heard
some noises on the, uh, on the deck.

40:51.208 --> 40:52.958
As if someone was working.

40:53.041 --> 40:53.875
What kind of noises?

40:53.958 --> 40:55.541
The fishing crane.

40:55.625 --> 40:57.958
Like maybe the cargo was being emptied.

40:58.541 --> 40:59.666
Where did they empty it?

40:59.750 --> 41:03.041
The ocean. They were throwing
something into the ocean.

41:04.291 --> 41:05.958
Oh, fuck off, Ángel. It makes no sense.

41:06.041 --> 41:08.375
Why wouldn't they just transfer
the cargo to another boat?

41:08.458 --> 41:11.958
-Why would they throw it into the sea?
-I don't know. They had some reason.

41:12.041 --> 41:13.625
And that question…

41:16.000 --> 41:17.208
the most important one…

41:18.916 --> 41:20.625
will be answered by forensics.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.250
They burned everything.

41:25.916 --> 41:30.041
The few things we were able to restore
are pieces of nautical cartography.

41:31.458 --> 41:33.958
They show the Bay of Biscay,
and it's a very wide radius.

41:34.041 --> 41:36.583
-How wide?
-Thirty, forty miles.

41:37.666 --> 41:40.291
-But there's something else too.
-What's that?

41:40.375 --> 41:41.916
It's a diagram for a depth buoy.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.250
It shows a marking
at 70 meters below the water's surface.

41:47.125 --> 41:50.125
It could be a beacon for something
anchored to the sea bottom.

41:57.625 --> 41:58.500
And then,

41:58.583 --> 42:01.375
once all that information
is spread out on the table,

42:01.458 --> 42:04.208
what had seemed crazy
will suddenly make sense.

42:05.625 --> 42:07.791
Because where is the only place

42:07.875 --> 42:10.958
you're able to leave
tons of gold for centuries

42:11.041 --> 42:12.583
without anyone finding it?

42:13.500 --> 42:19.125
Where can you find
all the lost treasure of Spanish galleons?

42:19.625 --> 42:21.208
The bottom of the ocean.

42:23.416 --> 42:24.750
The bottom of the ocean.

42:25.333 --> 42:26.500
There's that fucking buoy.

42:27.416 --> 42:28.708
We need to mobilize the Navy.

42:28.791 --> 42:30.833
I want frigates,
battleships, aircraft carriers,

42:30.916 --> 42:32.791
every goddamn fucking thing!

42:33.291 --> 42:35.666
We're going to comb the Cantabrian Sea.

42:35.750 --> 42:37.000
CANTABRIAN SEA, 11:54 A.M.

42:37.083 --> 42:38.500
We're changing directions.

42:38.583 --> 42:41.291
New course, the Bay of Biscay.
Tracking service.

42:41.375 --> 42:45.791
Tamayo was desperately trying
to hide that the gold had left the bank.

42:46.458 --> 42:50.625
He thought the best way to do this
was to pretend the war wasn't over.

42:50.708 --> 42:51.916
Fire at will!

42:59.833 --> 43:02.708
We can hear several gunshots
coming from inside the Bank of Spain.

43:02.791 --> 43:04.583
Apparently hostilities are continuing,

43:04.666 --> 43:06.833
although we still don't have
any more information.

43:09.458 --> 43:10.333
Gunshots?

43:14.708 --> 43:16.625
Yes, God damn it. Yes!

43:16.708 --> 43:18.458
-Hey, can you hear that?
-Shut up!

43:18.541 --> 43:20.583
-Know what that means?
-Get down!

43:24.416 --> 43:26.083
It's just a fucking smoke screen.

43:27.041 --> 43:30.166
A smoke screen
or they just executed the Professor.

43:31.916 --> 43:33.416
We gotta be hopeful.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.791
If the Professor's here,
then we'll be able to leave.

43:36.791 --> 43:38.916
Maybe you think too high of the Professor.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.375
We have to think positive.

43:41.041 --> 43:43.875
Here we go,
the classic positivity of idiots.

43:43.958 --> 43:45.500
Take a look around you, Rio.

43:46.875 --> 43:48.583
How many clips do you guys have?

43:49.250 --> 43:51.458
I mean, if you wanna think positive,

43:51.541 --> 43:54.833
I guess we can try to take them down
with some good old kung fu,

43:54.916 --> 43:57.500
then we escape and catch a train home.

43:59.291 --> 44:02.166
Positive thinking is
the downfall of civilization.

44:02.250 --> 44:05.250
I could even kick your ass right now.
I'm that optimistic.

44:05.833 --> 44:07.125
And do you know why?

44:07.208 --> 44:09.333
Because I was
inside a fucking tomb in Algeria.

44:09.416 --> 44:13.125
And all I could think about
was getting out of there, and here I am.

44:13.208 --> 44:16.000
You are here
because I got involved in all this.

44:17.250 --> 44:18.291
And this guy here.

44:19.333 --> 44:20.625
And that guy there.

44:21.208 --> 44:22.208
Understood?

44:22.291 --> 44:23.791
Well, I'm with Rio.

44:24.291 --> 44:26.750
My whole life I've been in fucking wars.

44:27.541 --> 44:28.791
Now I want peace.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.291
So I think about the future,

44:32.041 --> 44:33.125
a positive one.

44:34.750 --> 44:35.833
I, uh…

44:36.833 --> 44:38.291
No one has ever loved me.

44:38.958 --> 44:41.208
I've never had a serious relationship.

44:42.375 --> 44:44.416
I think it's finally my moment.

44:44.500 --> 44:47.500
Are we in jail by any chance,
formally arrested,

44:47.583 --> 44:49.083
waiting to be judged?

44:50.125 --> 44:53.083
Or are we dead inside a plastic bag?
No, right?

44:54.291 --> 44:55.583
And why is that?

44:58.708 --> 45:00.375
What do you know that I don't?

45:04.125 --> 45:06.708
I'm just paying attention
to the signs, my friends.

45:07.541 --> 45:10.333
We've been detained for 24 hours
and we're still alive.

45:11.416 --> 45:12.500
Denver is out there.

45:13.166 --> 45:14.291
He's arrested.

45:15.250 --> 45:16.625
That's the sign that I see.

45:19.041 --> 45:20.208
And it's irreversible.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.166
This guy knows something.

45:26.333 --> 45:29.083
You should try a little
positive thinking, my friends.

45:32.416 --> 45:34.250
The last thing Tamayo needed

45:34.333 --> 45:37.625
was a video that showed the world
everything he was trying to hide.

45:37.708 --> 45:39.708
Ladies and gentlemen,
as promised,

45:39.791 --> 45:42.375
the answer to the question
"How did we get the gold out of here?"

45:42.458 --> 45:44.125
It was thanks to this baby.

45:44.625 --> 45:49.041
This extraction pump propelled the gold
over a distance of 18 kilometers,

45:49.125 --> 45:52.500
to a location where our team outside
collected the nuggets,

45:52.583 --> 45:53.666
melted it down again,

45:53.750 --> 45:55.250
and turned it into gold ingots.

45:55.333 --> 45:56.958
That's the blatant proof now

45:58.166 --> 45:59.916
that we don't have the gold.

46:00.500 --> 46:02.916
…the gold has already left
the Bank of Spain.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.791
In today's treasury auction,

46:04.875 --> 46:07.500
we're going to lose
billions and billions of euros,

46:09.125 --> 46:10.333
week after week,

46:10.416 --> 46:13.000
until we're unable to get any financing.

46:13.083 --> 46:17.125
And after that,
the country will go bankrupt.

46:18.166 --> 46:19.916
I said to stop the exchange.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.875
I don't care if it's been open
for three minutes. Cut off the trading!

46:22.958 --> 46:24.375
The Professor was right.

46:25.500 --> 46:27.458
This is a total shitstorm.

46:28.541 --> 46:31.291
And just when everyone
thought the Spanish economy

46:31.375 --> 46:33.166
couldn't be more discredited…

46:33.666 --> 46:36.000
-Look at this!
-…came the cherry on top.

46:36.583 --> 46:38.583
You could argue that we were lying.

46:38.666 --> 46:41.875
But seeing the Navy combing
the sea in search of the gold

46:41.958 --> 46:44.791
was inarguable proof
of the success of our heist.

46:44.875 --> 46:46.916
Come on, who the fuck
tipped off the press?

46:47.000 --> 46:49.791
Everything I just told you,
multiply it by ten.

46:52.833 --> 46:55.708
That is how we close Plan Tom Thumb.

46:57.166 --> 46:58.416
And then finally…

46:59.416 --> 47:02.041
finally we'll be
in a position to negotiate.

47:06.541 --> 47:10.083
Nothing's been moved around for a while.
The garden is well kept.

47:11.375 --> 47:12.500
How many left?

47:13.666 --> 47:15.708
One. It's seven kilometers away.

47:15.791 --> 47:16.625
Let's go.

47:16.708 --> 47:19.916
It's a stone house built in 1926.
It's rustic.

47:25.458 --> 47:28.041
This one's prefabricated, right?

47:58.291 --> 47:59.708
Check the lawn.

48:52.708 --> 48:53.791
Now what do we do?

48:54.541 --> 48:58.250
Should we go, "One, two, three,"
then we all kill each other?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.166
Very well.

49:21.791 --> 49:23.000
No one can hear us.

49:24.166 --> 49:27.875
-I imagine you've got a plan.
-You're going to give a press conference.

49:28.791 --> 49:31.208
You'll say that after investigation,
the police…

49:32.625 --> 49:33.875
have found the gold.

49:38.083 --> 49:41.166
If I do that, then you'd have me
with my pants down.

49:41.250 --> 49:44.208
If I betray you on this,
you'll stop trusting me.

49:45.583 --> 49:48.166
-That's not good.
-It shouldn't be a matter of trust.

49:48.250 --> 49:50.458
It should be a matter of life and death.

49:50.541 --> 49:52.333
Suárez, Cañizo, proceed.

49:53.041 --> 49:53.875
On your feet!

50:03.541 --> 50:05.041
What the fuck is happening?

50:05.125 --> 50:06.416
No fucking clue, Manila.

50:07.625 --> 50:09.791
Trick me, Professor,

50:09.875 --> 50:12.000
and you'll watch your friends be executed.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.375
-Suárez, you hear me?
-Copy, Colonel.

50:15.791 --> 50:17.958
Now that you know
the game we're playing,

50:18.041 --> 50:21.666
do you really want me to go out there
and have a word with the press? Hm?

50:23.333 --> 50:25.250
I told you, "Either we both win…

50:27.541 --> 50:28.666
or we both lose."

50:30.125 --> 50:33.041
I know the plan of how to steal
the gold from the Bank of Spain.

50:33.666 --> 50:35.666
The little I don't know, I assume.

50:35.750 --> 50:39.041
You wanna give them back the gold
as a bargaining chip, isn't that right?

50:39.125 --> 50:40.916
But I won't let that happen.

50:41.833 --> 50:44.458
Because the true miracle
was to get it out.

50:44.958 --> 50:46.666
And that part is done.

50:47.250 --> 50:49.416
You must be the nephew, right?

50:51.500 --> 50:52.333
Rafael.

50:59.458 --> 51:01.125
Your uncle wrote this for you.

51:11.291 --> 51:12.208
Good morning.

51:12.708 --> 51:15.166
I regret to call you here
on such short notice,

51:15.250 --> 51:17.166
but I have an important announcement.

51:19.958 --> 51:22.416
The investigation by the police
has moved forward.

51:22.500 --> 51:26.125
We've intercepted two trucks carrying
the gold reserve of the Bank of Spain.

51:26.208 --> 51:28.000
Please.

51:28.083 --> 51:29.750
And you'll tell them something else.

51:29.833 --> 51:31.125
That I came into the bank

51:32.083 --> 51:35.875
so I could negotiate the gang's surrender
to prevent any greater harm.

51:35.958 --> 51:38.416
On that matter,
he went down to the bank's basement,

51:38.500 --> 51:39.750
48 meters deep,

51:39.833 --> 51:42.458
where the other robbers
are still entrenched,

51:42.541 --> 51:45.666
fending off the attacks
of the State Security Forces.

51:45.750 --> 51:49.291
And you'll conclude
with a message of trust and transparency.

51:49.375 --> 51:53.000
As soon as you show up on TV, those trucks
will make their way to the bank.

51:53.083 --> 51:55.416
You can escort them along the AP1 North.

51:55.500 --> 51:58.375
And how exactly will you give that order
arrested and handcuffed?

51:58.458 --> 51:59.666
It won't be me.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.125
The order is you.

52:03.208 --> 52:05.291
Your announcement on TV is the signal.

52:05.375 --> 52:08.125
It's all part of the plan.

52:08.208 --> 52:11.208
You'll have won,
and the whole world will see it.

52:36.541 --> 52:38.125
A dramatic turn of events.

52:38.208 --> 52:40.208
The gold returns to the Bank of Spain,

52:40.291 --> 52:42.500
in turn de-escalating
the stock market turmoil.

52:42.583 --> 52:47.958
The government and the economists agree
the debt crisis is now under control

52:48.041 --> 52:50.958
and it can be recovered
as fast as its downfall.

52:51.041 --> 52:53.416
Right this moment,
civil servants from the Bank of Spain

52:53.500 --> 52:56.000
and the State Security Forces
are unloading the gold

52:56.083 --> 52:58.833
from the trucks to get them
all back into the bank's vault.

53:00.250 --> 53:02.166
What trucks are those?

53:03.708 --> 53:05.125
It's part of the plan.

53:05.208 --> 53:06.791
A part of the plan I don't know?

53:06.875 --> 53:10.875
Not every secret should be told in bed.

53:10.958 --> 53:12.916
-What the fuck are you saying?
-Relax.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.916
I can't relax, because I don't know
what's happening right now.

53:17.291 --> 53:18.375
It was necessary.

53:21.625 --> 53:24.416
Maybe you can fool everyone else,
but not me, Sergio.

53:27.208 --> 53:28.208
I don't understand.

53:28.916 --> 53:34.250
You would never go into the Bank of Spain
to later return the gold. Never.

53:34.833 --> 53:36.875
Of course not. I'm doing it to save Rio.

53:36.958 --> 53:39.041
Yeah, yeah, sure.
He's a real fantastic kid.

53:39.125 --> 53:41.666
Why don't you tell me
the last part of the plan?

53:44.500 --> 53:47.583
No one who's going into the bank
can know the last part of the plan.

53:47.666 --> 53:49.125
Well, I can understand that.

53:50.500 --> 53:52.583
However, in that case, I'm out.

53:58.458 --> 53:59.416
Martín.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.208
What is a country's gold?

54:08.916 --> 54:09.958
Its wealth?

54:10.041 --> 54:10.875
No.

54:13.125 --> 54:15.708
It's… an illusion.

54:18.916 --> 54:20.375
It's an illusion.

54:22.500 --> 54:23.833
It's useless.

54:23.916 --> 54:26.583
Spain doesn't pay
for anything with that gold.

54:26.666 --> 54:28.583
Not one transaction. Nothing.

54:28.666 --> 54:30.583
It's…

54:30.666 --> 54:32.458
It's merely psychological.

54:44.250 --> 54:45.625
Gold for brass.

54:48.083 --> 54:51.833
So you'll do to the Bank of Spain
what Berlin did with the Viking treasure?

54:53.208 --> 54:54.833
The exchange was exquisite.

55:13.041 --> 55:14.041
Get out!

55:20.750 --> 55:24.083
The ingots that came in those trucks
are gold-coated brass.

55:24.166 --> 55:25.875
Just gold-coated brass.

55:26.875 --> 55:28.416
I warned you.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.083
-Suárez, Cañizo, weapons ready!
-Raise weapons!

55:35.583 --> 55:36.541
Tamayo, wait a minute.

55:36.625 --> 55:40.833
Those bars have stopped the debt crisis.

55:45.375 --> 55:47.666
Didn't you portray yourself
as a Robin Hood?

55:48.166 --> 55:50.500
Now you want to steal
the gold of an entire country?

56:01.625 --> 56:02.750
I'm a thief.

56:04.291 --> 56:05.541
Son of a thief.

56:07.625 --> 56:08.791
Brother of a thief.

56:16.500 --> 56:18.458
I hope someday
to be the father of a thief.

56:22.541 --> 56:24.708
No one can reject their nature, Tamayo.

56:25.541 --> 56:27.416
I'm leaving you an honorable way out.

56:28.958 --> 56:30.375
Think about it, Colonel.

56:33.625 --> 56:34.583
It's almost funny.

56:35.166 --> 56:37.958
You know perfectly well
it fits with the Spanish tradition.

56:38.458 --> 56:42.083
Which other country could have
a national reserve of fake gold

56:43.708 --> 56:47.250
and still be one of the most
important economies in the world?

56:48.583 --> 56:50.750
It's the Spanish picaresque.

56:51.250 --> 56:54.750
The Lazarillo de Tormes,
it wasn't written in English.

56:55.333 --> 56:56.375
Isn't that right?

56:56.958 --> 56:57.958
Tamayo,

56:59.000 --> 57:00.583
you will be a hero.

57:01.708 --> 57:02.541
A hero.

57:03.041 --> 57:05.041
And this small difference of metals

57:06.250 --> 57:08.083
will be just another state secret.

57:08.875 --> 57:12.458
It'll pass down from president
to president for the next 50,

57:13.250 --> 57:15.333
60, 70 years, but at the core…

57:17.875 --> 57:19.791
nothing is going to change.

57:21.708 --> 57:23.291
-Load them.
-Load!

57:24.666 --> 57:26.416
No, Tamayo. No!

57:27.875 --> 57:30.416
Did you really think
you'd get out of here that easily,

57:30.500 --> 57:33.375
leaving me a national reserve
made of brass?

57:33.458 --> 57:35.250
Tell me where to find the gold.

57:35.333 --> 57:36.458
-Ten.
-Ten!

57:38.916 --> 57:41.625
The brass reserve is the best
of your options right now, Tamayo.

57:41.708 --> 57:43.708
-Nine!
-You can't do this, Colonel.

57:43.791 --> 57:45.041
You can't do this.

57:45.125 --> 57:46.250
-Eight!
-Eight!

57:47.250 --> 57:50.500
If they shoot, I'll prove that all you
have out there is nothing more than junk!

57:51.375 --> 57:53.583
-Seven.
-I've got videos, I've got documents.

57:53.666 --> 57:55.625
-Everything will go public at once.
-Six.

57:55.708 --> 57:58.250
Do you know what that means?
The debt will skyrocket.

57:58.333 --> 57:59.708
The stock market will plummet.

57:59.791 --> 58:01.250
-The country will be broke.
-Five!

58:01.333 --> 58:03.375
It'll be total bankruptcy.
You won't have a plan B!

58:03.458 --> 58:04.666
-Four!
-Four!

58:04.750 --> 58:06.791
That brass will be
the best of both worlds! Tamayo!

58:06.875 --> 58:08.125
-Three!
-Three!

58:08.208 --> 58:09.125
Sergio!

58:11.708 --> 58:13.541
Accept it. All the markets accepted it.

58:13.625 --> 58:16.375
The rest of the world accepted it.
Only you have to accept it.

58:16.458 --> 58:17.666
-It's your only option.
-Two.

58:17.750 --> 58:18.833
Two!

58:20.250 --> 58:21.958
You'll never get the gold, you hear me?

58:22.041 --> 58:24.333
It's not even up to me.
The plan carries on.

58:24.416 --> 58:28.250
The gold is our protection,
the ones inside and the ones outside.

58:28.333 --> 58:30.125
-It'll never be returned.
-One!

58:31.166 --> 58:34.166
If you shoot, you'll only have
the dead bodies and bankruptcy.

58:34.250 --> 58:36.250
I told you and I'll say it again,

58:36.333 --> 58:38.875
either we both win or we both lose!

58:42.875 --> 58:43.791
Colonel,

58:45.541 --> 58:47.083
it's time for you to face it.

58:48.750 --> 58:50.583
This is checkmate.

59:06.583 --> 59:07.708
Good morning.

59:11.166 --> 59:12.916
The heist is officially over.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.875
The Army's Special Forces
have managed to gain access

59:16.958 --> 59:19.458
to the bank's basement
with the use of explosives,

59:19.541 --> 59:21.583
releasing the final hostages.

59:29.416 --> 59:31.791
HOSTAGES RELEASED FROM THE BANK OF SPAIN

59:44.500 --> 59:47.541
During the operation,
due to strong resistance,

59:47.625 --> 59:50.416
the following gang members
have been taken down.

59:53.708 --> 59:55.750
Aníbal Cortés, alias Rio.

59:58.416 --> 1:00:00.625
Santiago López, alias Bogotá.

1:00:02.666 --> 1:00:04.583
Julia Martínez, alias Manila.

1:00:06.750 --> 1:00:08.083
POLICE TAKE DOWN ROBBERS

1:00:08.166 --> 1:00:10.791
Matías Caño, alias Pamplona.

1:00:13.458 --> 1:00:15.625
Mirko Dragic, alias Helsinki.

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.333
Mónica Gaztambide, alias Stockholm.

1:00:27.791 --> 1:00:29.791
Martín Berrotti, alias Palermo.

1:00:35.083 --> 1:00:37.000
Raquel Murillo, alias Lisbon.

1:00:41.416 --> 1:00:44.500
And Sergio Marquina, alias the Professor.

1:01:10.750 --> 1:01:14.708
The police investigation that led
to the recovery of the national reserve

1:01:14.791 --> 1:01:20.000
was decisively aided by the cooperation
of Daniel Ramos, alias Denver,

1:01:20.083 --> 1:01:23.166
who will now be part
of our witness protection program

1:01:23.250 --> 1:01:25.958
until all legal actions are concluded.

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.083
No one chases
a dead man, Colonel.

1:02:19.708 --> 1:02:21.541
The real gold is our hostage.

1:02:22.625 --> 1:02:25.541
If you don't want
the biggest state secret to be revealed,

1:02:26.416 --> 1:02:28.708
this chase ends here and now.

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:30.958
Forever.

1:03:08.250 --> 1:03:10.458
THE DREAM ISN'T OVER

1:03:36.500 --> 1:03:38.750
Now,
what you're really wondering is,

1:03:38.833 --> 1:03:40.750
"What happened to the real gold?"

1:03:44.333 --> 1:03:45.875
He'd have wanted this.

1:03:46.541 --> 1:03:48.666
Are you sure
he'll give you your share?

1:03:49.166 --> 1:03:50.125
Yeah.

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:52.583
It's a matter of family.

1:04:02.250 --> 1:04:05.458
24 HOURS LATER

1:05:09.500 --> 1:05:10.541
We actually made it.

1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:26.000
-You gotta believe, brother.
-Always.

1:05:48.750 --> 1:05:49.958
Thank you.

1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:11.625
I almost blew it, huh?

1:06:21.958 --> 1:06:23.916
This man always has a double twist, right?

1:06:25.041 --> 1:06:26.000
You fuckers.

1:06:26.583 --> 1:06:28.708
I didn't say a word,
by the way.

1:06:37.791 --> 1:06:41.000
It didn't all work out the way we wanted.

1:06:46.541 --> 1:06:47.666
We're not all here.

1:06:50.916 --> 1:06:51.750
But…

1:06:54.916 --> 1:06:56.750
Well, we did achieve something.

1:07:01.250 --> 1:07:03.166
-Come on.
-Okay, okay.

1:08:09.708 --> 1:08:11.666
Professor, you have something for me.

1:08:20.875 --> 1:08:21.750
Lucía?

1:08:24.875 --> 1:08:26.083
And Victoria.

1:08:48.375 --> 1:08:49.375
And the gold?

1:08:52.125 --> 1:08:53.708
The gold's already in Portugal.

1:08:54.791 --> 1:08:56.000
It's in a little house.

1:08:57.208 --> 1:08:58.583
The little treasure house.

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.041
Nobody could've imagined
when this story began

1:09:32.333 --> 1:09:36.333
that we'd end up being escorted
to safety by an elite military team.

1:09:37.166 --> 1:09:40.875
And that we'd fly into our new life
without anyone knowing the truth.

1:09:41.916 --> 1:09:44.708
A new life, a free life,

1:09:45.541 --> 1:09:47.041
filled with gold.

1:09:48.875 --> 1:09:52.291
So that no one in the gang
would ever have to rob a bank again.

1:13:48.958 --> 1:13:52.583
OUR LEGACY CONTINUES THANKS TO ALL OF YOU,
THE REAL RESISTANCE
