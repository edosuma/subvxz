00:13.762 --> 00:15.740
After we made contact
with a few people,

00:15.776 --> 00:17.785
we knew that
there were more out there.

00:17.821 --> 00:20.970
So we picked up more trucks
so we could cover more ground.

00:21.046 --> 00:22.730
We'll find a place
to call home.

00:22.807 --> 00:25.624
Eventually.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.610
- We seem to have run out of gas.
- Hey.

00:27.687 --> 00:30.071
Tell me where
the damn oil fields are.

00:30.147 --> 00:33.132
- You with, uh, Logan?
- Look at that.

00:33.209 --> 00:35.392
Look, whatever you came here
for, you're not gonna find.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.995
Had a feelin'
you'd say that.

00:40.975 --> 00:43.334

to talk about,

now, do we, me and you?

01:42.961 --> 01:46.305

You wanna talk?

Let's talk.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.541
Hey.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.086
You okay,
young lady?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.803
W-What's your name?

04:23.881 --> 04:26.298
Charlie.

04:27.718 --> 04:30.478
Pleased to meet ya,
Charlie.

04:33.966 --> 04:35.566
I'm Rabbi Jacob Kessner.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.269
And, uh,

04:39.346 --> 04:42.105
welcome to
Temple B'nai Israel.

04:51.742 --> 04:54.752
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

04:57.581 --> 04:59.957
Thank you.

05:01.994 --> 05:04.586
I'm sorry.
I saw the light.

05:04.663 --> 05:08.507
Don't be sorry,
and, uh, it's not a light.

05:08.518 --> 05:11.510
It's Ner tamid.
Ow.

05:11.521 --> 05:14.021
The flame of truth,

05:14.098 --> 05:16.682
the, uh,
presence of God.

05:16.692 --> 05:19.518
She led you here.

05:19.529 --> 05:22.104
I like to think of God
as, uh...

05:22.180 --> 05:24.940
Well, seems God
needs new batteries.

05:25.017 --> 05:28.610
So, uh, why don't we get you
something to eat

05:28.687 --> 05:30.195
and maybe a towel?

05:55.347 --> 05:58.564

06:45.781 --> 06:49.074
Let's get these puppies
fueled up.

07:07.544 --> 07:09.086
Locked up tighter

07:09.096 --> 07:10.804
than fireman's sphincter
on the Fourth of July.

07:10.881 --> 07:13.474
We're runnin' 'em ragged,
June-bug.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.968
Took twice as long
to set up camp as yesterday.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.479
Well, we've got 12 hours
until sunset.

07:18.555 --> 07:20.814
Travelin' by night,
keepin' watch by day...

07:20.891 --> 07:22.566
it's really
takin' its toll.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.312
Logan's out there.

07:27.323 --> 07:29.981
And it's gonna take
Morgan, Al, Alicia, and Strand

07:29.992 --> 07:31.316
a couple days
to get to us.

07:31.327 --> 07:32.818
So we just keep moving
until then.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.653
How's the reserves?

07:34.664 --> 07:37.114
About 1,000 gals of unleaded
is all that separates us

07:37.190 --> 07:39.500
from stumblin' around
like the skinbags.

07:39.576 --> 07:41.085
So we'll do
another run.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.089
This isn't
just about the gas.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.175
I know.

07:48.252 --> 07:50.552
Why won't you just stop
and take a breath?

07:52.122 --> 07:54.840
This isn't the right place
to do it.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.142
Okay.

07:58.229 --> 08:00.521
Chow down and rest up,
baby face.

08:00.597 --> 08:02.189
Headin' for tank town
at 0800.

08:02.266 --> 08:04.808
We're gonna have to wait.
Uh, the headcount's off.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.694
No, everyone was accounted for
when we packed up.

08:06.770 --> 08:08.353
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

08:08.430 --> 08:10.147
Uh,
someone's missin'.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.533
Who?

08:48.479 --> 08:51.021
I can help.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.906
Oh, she's awake.

08:52.983 --> 08:54.733
Don't worry.

08:54.744 --> 08:57.745
You're not the first person
to fall asleep in my schul.

08:57.821 --> 09:00.748
I've been mostly sleeping
in cars lately.

09:00.824 --> 09:03.250
Oh, hard to rest without
a proper roof over your head.

09:09.425 --> 09:12.426
Yeah, well,
I'm used to it.

09:15.506 --> 09:17.422
Why are all these dead ones
following you?

09:18.842 --> 09:20.217
I was looking for something
last night,

09:20.293 --> 09:22.603
and I got separated
from my group.

09:22.679 --> 09:25.272
Walkers found me first.

09:25.349 --> 09:27.483
You have a group?

09:28.569 --> 09:30.444
We have to get you
back to them.

09:34.691 --> 09:38.160
Do you really think
that God led me here?

09:39.196 --> 09:41.497
Come here.

09:45.702 --> 09:48.295
You don't?

09:48.372 --> 09:50.288
Why would he?

09:50.299 --> 09:51.632
Why <i>wouldn't</i> he?

09:51.708 --> 09:53.801
Do you answer every question
with a question?

09:53.877 --> 09:55.135
Do I?

09:55.212 --> 09:57.462
In two minutes,
you figured out the secret

09:57.473 --> 10:00.132
it took me eight years
at Yeshiva to understand.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.759
Maybe there's something
you need here.

10:02.836 --> 10:06.522
Maybe you're here because
you're finally going to find it.

10:10.185 --> 10:11.652
Excuse me.

10:11.728 --> 10:14.479
Hashem calls.

10:35.678 --> 10:38.503
What happened
to all your people?

10:38.514 --> 10:41.348
Uh, same thing that happened
to most people.

10:41.425 --> 10:43.675
I used to talk
to my congregation

10:43.686 --> 10:46.303
about a thing called
t'chayth hameitim,

10:46.379 --> 10:49.139
that the souls of the dead
would rise

10:49.215 --> 10:50.858
and be reunited
with their bodies

10:50.934 --> 10:53.184
at the end
of this world.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.696
I suppose
I got it half right.

11:00.777 --> 11:04.371
Why do you still do that
if no one's here?

11:05.949 --> 11:07.708
It works for me.

11:07.784 --> 11:10.035
And because
of tradition.

11:10.045 --> 11:13.663
Tradition is
very important,

11:13.740 --> 11:15.549
more now than ever.

11:19.796 --> 11:21.379
Again?

11:25.802 --> 11:28.178
No, no, no.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.180
This is
the last battery.

11:34.144 --> 11:35.569
It can't go dark.

11:35.646 --> 11:37.905
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

11:37.981 --> 11:39.356
Right now.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.524
I need to find
some batteries.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.693
Wait.

11:45.438 --> 11:48.415
I know
where we can get some.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.759
It's Charlie.

11:58.835 --> 12:00.585
Does anybody copy?

12:00.662 --> 12:02.596
Charlie,
are you alright?

12:02.673 --> 12:04.589
Yeah,
I'm o... I'm okay.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.933
I'm so sorry
this happened.

12:06.009 --> 12:07.384
We thought everyone
was accounted for

12:07.460 --> 12:08.769
when we left
last night.

12:08.845 --> 12:10.938
It's not your fault,
June.

12:11.014 --> 12:12.940
You didn't leave
without me.

12:13.016 --> 12:14.265
I...

12:15.945 --> 12:17.236
I ran away.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.827
Why would you
do that?

12:27.014 --> 12:29.122
I can't keep living
the way we have.

12:29.199 --> 12:32.617
I just wanted to find someplace
that we could settle down.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.962
I checked some places last night.

12:35.038 --> 12:38.966
None of them were right, but now...

12:39.042 --> 12:42.794
now I think I may have found
a place that we could call home.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.254
Where are you,
Charlie?

12:44.330 --> 12:45.797
We'll come get you,
bring you back to the convoy.

12:45.808 --> 12:48.475
You need to come see this place
for yourself.

12:48.552 --> 12:51.186
Oh, and bring some car batteries
with you.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.997
Where are
they coming from?

13:10.073 --> 13:11.999
Must be a gap
in the fence somewhere.

13:12.075 --> 13:13.450
I'll find it.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.503
My friends are coming
with your batteries.

13:16.580 --> 13:17.996
They can help.

13:18.007 --> 13:21.508
Keeping the flame lit
is a mitzvah unto itself.

13:21.585 --> 13:23.010
I can take care
of the fence.

13:23.086 --> 13:25.762
Wait inside.
Make yourself at home.

15:11.477 --> 15:16.623
Yiskadal,
v'yis kadash sh'may raboh...

15:16.700 --> 15:19.793
B'alma di v'ra chirutei,

15:19.870 --> 15:23.580
v'yamlich malchutei.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.800
Behayekhon uvyomekhon.

15:42.151 --> 15:44.276
That should do it.

15:46.137 --> 15:49.147
I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

15:49.158 --> 15:50.481
Well,
you kept Charlie safe here.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.783
That's the least
we could do.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.739
So, this convoy of yours,
how many people are there?

15:57.815 --> 15:59.657
Uh, we're up
to 36 now.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.661
Tzadikim Nitsarim.

16:03.672 --> 16:07.457
The mystics believe that
there are 36 righteous people

16:07.533 --> 16:09.292
in the world
at any given time.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.012
Maybe I've come across
three of them today.

16:12.088 --> 16:13.755
Well,
we do what we can.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.465
Um...

16:15.541 --> 16:17.851
We really should be getting back
to the rest of our people.

16:17.928 --> 16:19.853
No.

16:19.930 --> 16:22.856
The rabbi...
I told him that we would stay

16:22.933 --> 16:24.357
and help him
fix his fence.

16:24.434 --> 16:29.196
Oh, I... you've done
more than enough already.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.273
You helped me.

16:32.350 --> 16:34.576
Let us help you.

16:35.687 --> 16:38.246
I'll go with her.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.715
Oh, hey,
I got somethin' for ya.

16:48.792 --> 16:51.551
Here. It's tasty.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.714
I'm just checking.

16:58.376 --> 17:01.135
Oh, I have something
for you, too.

17:01.212 --> 17:03.396
Aw.

17:04.942 --> 17:07.559
Put it on.

17:07.569 --> 17:08.893
Not for me.

17:08.904 --> 17:10.228
For Hashem.

17:10.239 --> 17:12.280
Hashem?

17:13.391 --> 17:15.407
Ah.

17:15.484 --> 17:17.151
Yep.

17:17.228 --> 17:19.746
How do I look?

17:19.823 --> 17:21.321
Goyish.

17:21.398 --> 17:23.741
- Kinda like the pope.
- Oh.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.211
But not bad.

17:35.413 --> 17:37.806
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

17:49.427 --> 17:53.029
We should pull
the van inside.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.108
We try, it might bring
the whole thing down.

17:57.119 --> 18:00.194
Charlie, I know you wanna find
a place to settle down.

18:00.271 --> 18:01.446
We all do.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.448
But I'm not sure
that this is it.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.199
Why not?

18:05.276 --> 18:06.868
'Cause it's not
big enough.

18:06.944 --> 18:08.962
There's not a water source
for miles.

18:09.039 --> 18:10.630
- The fence isn't strong enough.
- We can fix it.

18:10.707 --> 18:12.790
- Charlie.
- I know it may not be perfect,

18:12.801 --> 18:14.125
but it's better
than stopping

18:14.136 --> 18:16.136
in a different place
every day.

18:16.212 --> 18:18.379
It's better
than going out on a run

18:18.456 --> 18:19.797
and not even knowing
if your home

18:19.808 --> 18:21.474
is still gonna be there
when you get back.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.979
I've lived like that before,
June.

18:26.056 --> 18:27.480
We both have.

18:27.557 --> 18:29.432
I don't wanna
go back to that.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.225
Is that
what this is about?

18:35.681 --> 18:37.398
Who we used to be?

18:41.071 --> 18:43.496
Is it really
that different?

18:45.575 --> 18:48.242
<i>We're</i> different.

18:48.319 --> 18:52.830
We may have been in a caravan,
but that was...

18:52.841 --> 18:54.916
that went bad.

18:54.992 --> 18:56.668
This won't.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.837
Yeah.

18:59.848 --> 19:03.132
I thought
the same thing then.

19:08.857 --> 19:11.641
That tanker truck
is unprotected.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.435
This place,
I know what you want it to be,

19:14.512 --> 19:15.853
but it just isn't.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.939
We need to get back
to the convoy.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.449
That's not bad.

19:28.526 --> 19:29.992
Seriously?

19:30.069 --> 19:32.662
I think Dan the Man
mighta nicked your taste buds

19:32.738 --> 19:34.664
when he was trimmin' up
your face pubes.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.139
Any sign
of ol' Swatty?

19:51.215 --> 19:53.641
No,
not yet.

19:53.718 --> 19:55.893
He'll be back.

19:57.388 --> 19:59.739
Here's to the road.

19:59.816 --> 20:03.151
Hard to remember
anything but.

20:03.227 --> 20:05.370
I hear that.
Hm.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.866
Wen and I have been
poundin' the pavement

20:09.942 --> 20:12.743
since before munchers
started munchin'.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.004
At least
you had each other.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.302
How long
you been hoofin' it solo?

20:22.347 --> 20:23.921
I don't know.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.923
I, uh...

20:25.934 --> 20:28.718
I just s-sorta
lost track of time.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.512
I think I'd have
gone off the deep end.

20:31.589 --> 20:35.024
That long,
nobody to talk to?

20:36.427 --> 20:39.028
I almost did.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.075
But your gal kept you goin',
the idea of her?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.527
Yeah.

20:46.604 --> 20:48.738
And the walkers,
too.

20:48.814 --> 20:52.792
Yeah, I remember
just watchin' 'em, you know,

20:52.869 --> 20:56.579
when I was sleepin' in cars
or whatever,

20:56.656 --> 20:59.373
just sorta
wanderin' around.

20:59.450 --> 21:02.543
You know, who knows
how far they came from

21:02.620 --> 21:04.879
or where
they're goin'?

21:04.956 --> 21:06.547
They're just wanderin',
you know?

21:06.624 --> 21:09.434
It's a life
on the road forever.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.979
I say to hell with that.

21:15.466 --> 21:17.400
Yeah, I did.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.396
Shit.

21:22.473 --> 21:24.899
What?

21:24.976 --> 21:26.400
Logan's guys.

21:26.477 --> 21:27.944
They found us.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.124
Did you
make that yourself?

21:33.201 --> 21:35.785
Mogen David's not so easy
to come by anymore,

21:35.861 --> 21:38.412
so I started keeping
a small vineyard

21:38.489 --> 21:39.789
in the back garden.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.250
Always had
a bit of a Green thumb.

21:47.498 --> 21:50.758
You said that God led me here
for a reason.

21:50.835 --> 21:52.977
I think
you may be right.

21:54.523 --> 21:58.015
Well, you do look better
than when you got here,

21:58.026 --> 22:00.601
and the eternal flame
is looking better,

22:00.678 --> 22:03.488
so I think she left us
with a win/win.

22:05.683 --> 22:08.150
I wanna live here.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.443
We all can.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.205
I don't think
that's a good idea.

22:13.783 --> 22:16.117
What?

22:16.193 --> 22:17.994
Why not?

22:19.322 --> 22:22.456
Charlie...

22:22.533 --> 22:24.375
we really need
to get going.

22:27.913 --> 22:31.048
You can go,
but I'm staying.

22:31.059 --> 22:33.634
No, Charlie, you should be
with your people.

22:33.711 --> 22:36.053
But this place,
you're all alone here.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.847
So we could stay
and live with you

22:37.923 --> 22:39.724
and help make sure
the lamp always stays lit.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.902
I appreciate everything
you've done for me, really,

22:42.979 --> 22:45.238
but I think
you should probably...

22:45.315 --> 22:47.240
June, John, you copy?

22:47.317 --> 22:49.317
She's breaking
radio silence.

22:50.895 --> 22:53.321
Sarah,
what's wrong?

22:55.441 --> 22:58.910
Dick squad
tracked us down.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.494
What?

23:00.571 --> 23:02.496
How did they
find us?

23:02.573 --> 23:03.873
I got
no Goddamn clue.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.499
Sent everybody else
to the rendezvous,

23:05.576 --> 23:07.260
but we gotta get
the hell outta here,

23:07.337 --> 23:10.096
and we're gonna need
that Swatty pronto.

23:10.173 --> 23:11.422
We're on our way.

23:24.595 --> 23:26.562
The fence.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.363
Get back inside.

23:35.439 --> 23:37.531
I don't understand.
Did we do something?

23:37.608 --> 23:38.783
How did they
get in here?

23:38.793 --> 23:40.117
They're not here
because of you.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.628
They're here
because of me.

23:41.704 --> 23:43.796
What are you talking about?
Who are they?

23:45.375 --> 23:47.884
My congregation.

23:55.051 --> 23:57.885
When the world
started to change,

23:57.962 --> 24:00.429
my congregants came here
for help.

24:00.506 --> 24:01.814
We put up fences.

24:01.891 --> 24:04.600
We gathered all the food
and water we could.

24:04.677 --> 24:07.228
We managed in here
for weeks,

24:07.304 --> 24:10.439
but we started
to run low on supplies.

24:10.516 --> 24:16.278
I left to go find some,
and when I came back...

24:16.355 --> 24:19.824
You found them
like this?

24:21.836 --> 24:24.003
- Sorry.
- No, <i>I'm</i> sorry.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.998
You're only here
because you're helping me.

24:27.008 --> 24:29.667
And we ain't
done yet.

24:29.678 --> 24:33.421
We go inside,
and we'll stay quiet.

24:33.497 --> 24:35.348
They'll go away.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.351
It could take days.

24:38.428 --> 24:42.188
I'm afraid we're on
a tighter timetable than that.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.937
I got an idea.

24:55.695 --> 24:56.828
You ready?

24:56.904 --> 24:58.204
Ready.

24:58.281 --> 25:00.781
You say a prayer
for us?

25:13.704 --> 25:15.722
I think it's good.

25:15.798 --> 25:17.214
Okay.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.155
Got it?

25:41.232 --> 25:42.531
Okay.

25:42.608 --> 25:44.492
Good job.

25:55.671 --> 25:58.547
- Slow and steady.
- Okay.

26:01.177 --> 26:04.762
Good job.

26:17.101 --> 26:19.902
Alright,
we can do this.

26:29.113 --> 26:30.788
Alright,
I'm gonna give it a try.

26:30.799 --> 26:32.748
- Alright, yep, got you.
- You comin'?

26:38.831 --> 26:42.049
Alright.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.324
I got you.

27:04.073 --> 27:07.616
Good. Good.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.178
Everybody, stay ahead.
We'll meet up at the rendezvous.

27:19.255 --> 27:20.847
They just want
what we got in the tank,

27:20.923 --> 27:22.506
so we'll make sure
they don't get it.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.175
Easier said than done,
sweetheart.

27:24.185 --> 27:26.176
Who the hell
is this?

27:26.187 --> 27:28.855
Ask your copilot.
He'll tell ya.

27:28.931 --> 27:31.691
Shoulda taken the shot
when he had the chance.

27:31.767 --> 27:33.851
You know this dick?

27:33.862 --> 27:36.645
I had him,
and I, uh...

27:36.722 --> 27:38.197
I let him go.

27:38.274 --> 27:40.649
Thought I was doin'
a good thing.

27:40.726 --> 27:43.027
No good deed,
right?

27:43.037 --> 27:45.446
How we doin'
on the Swatty?

27:45.522 --> 27:47.540
Could really use the assist
right about now.

27:47.617 --> 27:50.159
Workin' on it.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.039
Got it.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.048
- Got it?
- Come on over.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.589
Come on.

28:43.914 --> 28:45.172
John!

29:08.698 --> 29:11.448
You're almost there.

29:33.523 --> 29:35.556
What's wrong?

29:35.632 --> 29:38.100
What happened?

29:39.678 --> 29:41.645
We're not
gonna make it.

29:41.656 --> 29:44.481
Sarah, it's gonna take longer
than you think.

29:44.492 --> 29:47.326
They might be
on their own.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.339
How'd you know
this was gonna happen?

30:00.416 --> 30:01.623
I didn't.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.176
You knew
this wasn't the right place.

30:04.253 --> 30:06.345
If I could
explain it...

30:09.300 --> 30:11.058
I suppose
you probably would.

30:14.505 --> 30:16.022
It's okay.
It's okay.

30:16.098 --> 30:18.524
We can pick them off
one by one.

30:18.601 --> 30:20.860
How many bullets
do you have?

30:20.936 --> 30:24.146
No, I can't use bullets,
not on them.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.898
I'm sorry.

30:25.974 --> 30:28.034
No, Charlie, I don't
think there's enough time,

30:28.110 --> 30:30.202
and I think it's just gonna
draw more of them past.

30:36.527 --> 30:38.952
Charlie,
you know how we fix this.

30:39.029 --> 30:41.172
How?

30:42.533 --> 30:45.176
Same as we used to.

30:49.540 --> 30:51.057
No.

30:51.133 --> 30:54.301
I'm not
giving this place up.

30:56.755 --> 30:58.347
Charlie,
it's okay.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.900
No, it's not okay.
It's not okay.

31:00.976 --> 31:02.684
This is where
I'll be safe.

31:02.761 --> 31:04.186
I saw that light,

31:04.263 --> 31:06.688
and you even said that
God led me here for a reason.

31:06.765 --> 31:08.908
I should never
have told you that.

31:08.984 --> 31:10.576
- Why?
- Because I don't believe it.

31:12.154 --> 31:13.412
I don't understand.

31:13.489 --> 31:15.081
I don't
believe in God.

31:15.157 --> 31:16.749
I haven't
in a long time.

31:16.826 --> 31:19.868
Is it because of
what happened to them?

31:21.497 --> 31:23.923
When I left the synagogue,
when I left them...

31:25.284 --> 31:26.926
...it wasn't to get supplies
like I said.

31:27.002 --> 31:30.337
It was because I'd already
started to lose faith.

31:30.414 --> 31:33.099
I saw what was happening
to the world.

31:33.175 --> 31:35.008
I saw what people were doing
to each other.

31:35.085 --> 31:37.010
So, then,
why did you go?

31:37.087 --> 31:39.438
How could I lead them
if I didn't believe?

31:39.515 --> 31:41.723
I wandered around
for weeks on my own,

31:41.800 --> 31:44.726
looking for something
to change my mind.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.228
I didn't find it.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.521
So you came back?

31:47.598 --> 31:49.523
They were
already dead...

31:51.268 --> 31:55.737
...already locked
inside that building.

31:55.814 --> 31:59.366
Whatever happened to them
while I was gone,

31:59.443 --> 32:01.577
it wasn't pleasant.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.245
But that
doesn't mean...

32:03.322 --> 32:05.464
It does.
I'm alive because I left.

32:05.541 --> 32:08.134
I'm alive because
I didn't believe in God.

32:08.210 --> 32:10.043
If that isn't
a clear message,

32:10.120 --> 32:11.470
I don't know
what is.

32:11.547 --> 32:13.472
So the prayers,
the lamp, the...

32:13.549 --> 32:15.141
It's all
I have left...

32:15.217 --> 32:17.759
the rhythms of a life
I'm trying to hold on to.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.555
And now... now I've put you
and your friends at great risk

32:21.632 --> 32:23.432
because I couldn't even
let go of that.

32:23.508 --> 32:24.892
Don't do the same,
Charlie.

32:24.968 --> 32:28.395
Don't lose your people
because you can't let go

32:28.472 --> 32:30.990
of what you thought
this place could be.

32:42.745 --> 32:45.171
June.

32:45.247 --> 32:47.456
Yeah, Charlie?

32:52.871 --> 32:54.922
You're right.

32:54.998 --> 32:57.424
We can fix this.

33:07.269 --> 33:09.102
Okay.

33:11.181 --> 33:13.866
Do you have anything
that makes a lot of noise?

33:20.232 --> 33:22.708
John,
this may not be it,

33:22.785 --> 33:25.044
but some
of the others?

33:25.120 --> 33:26.620
Maybe they were.

33:26.697 --> 33:28.214
Maybe we already
missed it.

33:28.290 --> 33:30.165
Hey, don't go gettin'
all introspective on me

33:30.242 --> 33:31.550
at a time
like this.

33:31.627 --> 33:33.385
I'm the one that's kept us
on the move this long.

33:33.462 --> 33:36.222
Thought it was
the right thing.

33:36.298 --> 33:39.225
Maybe just
every time I settle down...

33:39.301 --> 33:41.635
Yeah, just... just didn't
turn out the way you hoped.

33:41.712 --> 33:44.063
Yeah.

33:44.139 --> 33:45.397
Well, unfortunately,
that just may be

33:45.474 --> 33:46.848
the world we live in,

33:46.925 --> 33:49.068
whether we're on the move
or stationary.

33:49.144 --> 33:51.237
Current circumstances...
exhibit "A."

33:52.982 --> 33:55.741
Ah.

34:25.514 --> 34:26.938
Charlie.

35:38.286 --> 35:40.754
I'm sorry
it didn't end up

35:40.831 --> 35:44.091
being a place
that you could call home.

35:56.054 --> 35:58.364
It's okay.

36:04.688 --> 36:07.614
Hashem calls.

36:32.307 --> 36:34.224
Turd in
a toilet bowl.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.684
What?

36:35.760 --> 36:37.403
I'm running' outta gas.

36:37.479 --> 36:39.980
We're drivin'
the tanker. What...

36:40.056 --> 36:42.574
This ain't
bottomless mimosas, chief.

36:42.651 --> 36:44.076
Tank's not connected.

36:52.068 --> 36:54.420
Ugh!

36:54.496 --> 36:57.205
Shit.

37:26.528 --> 37:31.114
We go down,
we go down with the ship.

37:31.125 --> 37:34.618
Even if we end up
crispy critters.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.123
Yeah, it's been fun
ridin' with ya.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.132
You, too, baby face.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.484
Where the hell
are they goin'?

38:07.495 --> 38:10.111
Somethin'
scared 'em off.

38:22.343 --> 38:26.461
Good ol' Swatty.
Oh!

38:31.001 --> 38:32.518
We're lucky
you ran into the rabbi

38:32.594 --> 38:33.802
and not someone else.

38:33.879 --> 38:35.521
I'm sorry.

38:35.597 --> 38:38.524
If I hadn't
run away, then...

38:38.600 --> 38:40.192
No.

38:40.269 --> 38:42.435
You don't need
to apologize.

38:42.512 --> 38:45.197
Think I've just been
pushing everyone too hard.

38:45.274 --> 38:47.983
I know I keep saying we're
gonna find the right place,

38:48.059 --> 38:50.527
but maybe I'm just holding on
to an idea

38:50.538 --> 38:51.912
that isn't out there.

38:53.207 --> 38:55.707
Can I ask you a question?

38:55.784 --> 38:58.377
- Rabbi?
- Um...

38:58.453 --> 39:01.755
what makes you think
it's out there?

39:04.459 --> 39:07.210
I don't know.

39:07.221 --> 39:09.555
I just feel it.

39:09.631 --> 39:11.890
Hmm.

39:11.967 --> 39:13.341
That's faith.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.552
Don't underestimate it.

39:15.563 --> 39:17.220
I don't know about you,

39:17.231 --> 39:20.223
but I'm gonna start
looking again

39:20.234 --> 39:23.852
for what
I need to find,

39:23.929 --> 39:25.979
and I won't stop
till I find it.

39:26.056 --> 39:27.689
Well, we got gas.

39:27.766 --> 39:31.151
As much as we need
after a run to the oil fields.

39:33.229 --> 39:35.581
- So we'll keep driving...
- Mm-hmm.

39:35.657 --> 39:38.825
...we'll keep helping,

39:38.902 --> 39:41.828
and we'll find the place
we're meant to be.

39:41.905 --> 39:45.874
Yeah, we will.

39:54.018 --> 39:55.925
We haven't yet
had the pleasure.

39:55.936 --> 39:57.260
I'm Sarah.

39:57.271 --> 39:59.054
Rabbi Jacob Kessner.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.222
Good to have you
with us, Rabbi.

40:01.299 --> 40:02.774
Say, you wouldn't
happen to know

40:02.851 --> 40:04.851
how far out we are from
Yom Kippur, would ya?

40:04.928 --> 40:07.112
I got a few things
to atone for.

40:07.189 --> 40:09.114
You've got
some time yet.

40:10.350 --> 40:12.943
You're Jewish?

40:12.953 --> 40:14.953
Rabinowitz.

40:15.030 --> 40:16.905
Card-carrying member
of the tribe.

40:16.982 --> 40:19.449
I was about to do
the Ma'ariv.

40:19.460 --> 40:20.867
Care to join me?

40:20.944 --> 40:22.410
You ever say kiddush
with a Saison?

40:22.487 --> 40:23.870
No need.

40:23.947 --> 40:25.872
I make
my own wine.

40:25.949 --> 40:27.207
My kinda rabbi.

40:27.283 --> 40:29.343
Come on.

40:30.446 --> 40:32.471
Well, at least we got
Logan's crew off our backs.

40:32.547 --> 40:34.473
For the time bein'
anyway.

40:34.549 --> 40:36.091
Yeah?

40:36.167 --> 40:38.810
Um, burned through
a lot of gas

40:38.887 --> 40:41.429
just to turn
and drive away.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.098
I imagine
they didn't count on

40:43.174 --> 40:45.225
the cavalry showin' up
when it did, yeah?

40:45.301 --> 40:47.102
Maybe.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.979
From what I've seen
of Logan so far...

40:49.990 --> 40:51.657
I mean,
these guys,

40:51.733 --> 40:54.567
they don't... they don't
do anything by accident.

41:06.581 --> 41:08.790
Go for Desert Fox.

41:08.867 --> 41:10.625
Those assholes
and their panzer

41:10.702 --> 41:12.678
are as far away
from you as possible.

41:12.754 --> 41:14.012
You're all clear.

41:14.089 --> 41:16.923
That's what
I like to hear.

41:21.596 --> 41:24.097
We're almost outta gas.

41:25.434 --> 41:26.933
No, we're not.

41:42.617 --> 41:44.951
We're lookin' for oil,
not rocks.

41:45.028 --> 41:48.830
Well, Polar Bear always did have
a sense of humor.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.166
Hang on
to your hat, Doris.

41:51.242 --> 41:54.720
We're about to buy ourselves
a ticket to the promised land.
