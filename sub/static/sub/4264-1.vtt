01:45.770 --> 01:47.290
It's almost new.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.800
Three hundred cartridges.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.640
The guy who
gave it to me said...

01:57.750 --> 02:03.150
you can hit
as far as three kilometers.

02:10.090 --> 02:11.790
How much are you asking
for all of this?

02:12.160 --> 02:13.820
One thousand dirhams.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.860
One thousand dirhams?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.160
I'll give you five hundred.

02:26.910 --> 02:28.030
And a goat.

02:37.150 --> 02:42.490
With this rifle, your sons
will kill plenty of jackals.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.160
Here, let one of your boys try.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.630
Let Yussef shoot.

02:52.170 --> 02:53.500
Dad, I want to shoot first.

03:02.380 --> 03:05.780
This is the safety.
Push it in when you're ready.

03:09.850 --> 03:13.620
If he doesn't hit the jackals,
at least he'll scare the shit out of them.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.190
Your turn Yussef.

03:28.870 --> 03:31.460
He shoots better than you.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.050
Good luck,
have a good day.

03:41.150 --> 03:42.140
God bless you.

03:42.250 --> 03:45.220
Kill at least three jackals.

03:46.090 --> 03:50.580
Make sure no one
sees you with the rifle...

03:50.690 --> 03:54.560
if you see someone coming, hide it.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.800
What are you doing?

04:37.310 --> 04:38.830
I told you,
don't spy on her.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.500
What do you care?

04:40.610 --> 04:42.270
Move it.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.360
Five to two.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.600
There's a jackal.

05:08.700 --> 05:09.670
Where?

05:10.510 --> 05:11.490
Over there.

05:16.340 --> 05:18.710
What are you doing,
you idiot?

05:37.500 --> 05:39.330
Zohra doesn't mind.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.660
She doesn't, but I do.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.480
This is between her and me.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.840
You're both pigs.
Next time I'm going to tell Dad.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.840
Stay out of this.

05:55.950 --> 05:59.480
If you want me to stay out of it,
don't do it.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.240
What are you doing?

07:03.690 --> 07:06.480
Hassan said this bullet
could reach three kilometers.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.990
That rock didn't move.

07:09.090 --> 07:11.490
You don't know how to shoot.
Give me the rifle.

07:19.970 --> 07:20.960
See.

07:21.070 --> 07:23.800
Yeah, but that's not
three kilometers.

07:36.950 --> 07:39.440
I bet the bullet
can't hit that far.

07:43.490 --> 07:45.290
These bullets are lame.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.820
You're not aiming right.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.600
What'll you give me
if I hit that car?

07:54.770 --> 07:56.130
I'll shoot.

08:02.310 --> 08:04.280
You see? Nothing.

08:04.410 --> 08:05.670
Let me shoot.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.570
Shoot at it.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.690
See... nothing.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.230
You're right, they're useless.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.460
Where are these kids?

08:55.730 --> 08:58.260
Where are you?

08:58.870 --> 09:01.330
I'm coming to get you...

09:01.440 --> 09:02.730
Base!

09:04.570 --> 09:06.560
You win.

09:06.970 --> 09:08.670
<i>- Yes?
- Amelia?</i>

09:09.010 --> 09:10.140
Yes, sir.

09:11.180 --> 09:12.270
<i>Hi. How's everything?</i>

09:12.380 --> 09:14.350
Everything is okay, sir.

09:14.820 --> 09:18.450
Mrs. Rachel told me.
I am very sorry, sir.

09:18.820 --> 09:20.380
How's Mrs. Susan?

09:20.560 --> 09:24.490
<i>She's better now.
They're going to have to operate, but...</i>

09:24.830 --> 09:27.320
<i>Look, Rachel's flying in tonight.</i>

09:27.460 --> 09:30.520
<i>She's gonna find someone to
take care of the kids so you can go.</i>

09:30.630 --> 09:34.120
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.900
<i>So, look after them, okay?
Don't tell them anything.</i>

09:37.000 --> 09:39.500
No, no, no. Don't worry, sir.
Don't worry. Okay.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.630
<i>- Put Mike on, please.
- Yes, sir.</i>

09:41.980 --> 09:44.210
Mike? Your dad is calling.

09:47.950 --> 09:50.510
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?</i>

09:50.620 --> 09:54.490
Good. Dad, guess what? Today
they brought hermit crabs to class.

09:54.590 --> 09:55.720
<i>Oh, really?</i>

09:56.420 --> 10:01.090
I held one in my hands. It bit me.
It really didn't bleed, but...

10:01.900 --> 10:04.060
Dad? Are you okay?

10:04.230 --> 10:06.100
<i>I'm okay. Everything's fine.</i>

10:06.200 --> 10:09.000
Mariana wanted to take one home.
But the teacher didn't let her. She was...

10:09.140 --> 10:10.930
I don't want to go to sleep.
I don't want to go to sleep.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.970
Mike. Mike.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.370
Did you brush your teeth?

10:26.290 --> 10:28.450
Sleep with angels, my darling.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.490
Sleep well, sweetie.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.230
Amelia?

10:44.240 --> 10:45.600
Amelia?

10:50.080 --> 10:51.740
Could you leave the light on?

10:51.850 --> 10:53.610
You are already sharing a room...

10:53.710 --> 10:56.910
didn't we agree
to sleep with the lights off?

10:57.020 --> 10:58.320
But I'm scared.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.440
There's nothing to be scared of.

11:00.590 --> 11:04.580
But I'm scared that what happened
to Sam is going to happen to me.

11:06.330 --> 11:10.020
No, that won't happen to you.

11:11.130 --> 11:13.160
Sam died while he was sleeping.

11:13.270 --> 11:15.000
No, baby, no, no.

11:15.370 --> 11:19.830
That only happens to some babies
when they're really, really little.

11:20.610 --> 11:23.740
Your brother is already
high in heaven, baby.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.870
I'll sit here with you.
But you can't talk anymore, okay?

11:29.550 --> 11:30.950
Go to sleep.

12:01.850 --> 12:04.220
But today is my son's wedding, sir.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.080
<i>Cancel your son's wedding.
I'll pay for another one,</i>

12:06.190 --> 12:09.380
<i>I'll pay for a better one.
I need you to do this, Amelia.</i>

12:09.490 --> 12:11.480
Everything is ready, sir.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.920
Can't anyone come to take care
of the kids? It's just one day, sir.

12:16.030 --> 12:17.220
<i>How do you expect me to find someone
from here?</i>

12:17.330 --> 12:20.320
<i>Susan's still recovering, and Rachel
can't make it to take care of the kids.</i>

12:20.430 --> 12:22.160
<i>Can't do it. Hold on.</i>

12:24.010 --> 12:27.570
<i>We're really counting on you, Amelia.
I'm sorry, but you have to do this.</i>

12:27.680 --> 12:29.270
<i>- But...
- Goodbye.</i>

12:38.820 --> 12:41.620
How can I be
in two places at once?

12:41.790 --> 12:44.620
I'm just asking you
to take them for today.

12:45.490 --> 12:48.220
I can't, the mister is still home.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.890
And they aren't going out?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.970
No, I don't think so.

12:53.270 --> 12:56.630
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.510
I can't Amelia.

13:02.710 --> 13:04.340
Please, it's my son's wedding.

13:04.850 --> 13:08.510
Just for the day, Lucia.
I'll be back for them tonight.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.850
And what do I say to Mrs. Catherine?

13:11.950 --> 13:15.620
I don't know.
Tell her they're your nephews.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.780
Right, because they look
so much like me...

13:17.890 --> 13:19.860
with my American looking face!

13:21.400 --> 13:22.950
Are we going to see your house?

13:23.060 --> 13:25.930
Yes. You are going to see my house.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.470
Is it far?

13:27.870 --> 13:29.530
No, no.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.350
What's up?

13:45.390 --> 13:46.480
Hi Auntie.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.560
Great to see you, Santiago.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.450
Mike. Debbie.

13:52.690 --> 13:53.720
Hello!

13:54.360 --> 13:55.800
Hello, hello.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.630
They're really shy.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.600
What? These kids
are coming with us?

13:59.700 --> 14:01.900
I couldn't find anyone to watch them.

14:02.140 --> 14:03.830
Their parents won't return tonight.

14:03.940 --> 14:05.840
Why bring them?
They'll drive you crazy.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.140
Don't worry,
they're very good kids.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.480
Don't you want to
leave them with somebody?

14:11.580 --> 14:12.940
I know a girl who
can take care of them.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.850
Are you crazy?
I have to take them with me.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.680
I can't leave them
with just anybody.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.680
Are you sure, Auntie?

14:39.210 --> 14:40.500
You want to order?

14:41.680 --> 14:45.840
Yeah, I'll have the chicken couscous
and a Coke.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.780
What do you have
that doesn't have fat in it?

14:49.880 --> 14:51.180
Everything is delicious.

14:52.490 --> 14:55.420
I'll have the fried eggplant
and a Diet Coke.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.290
Sorry, we don't have Diet Coke.

14:57.390 --> 14:59.760
- Then a regular Coke.
- Two Cokes.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.650
Richard, why did we come here?

15:22.820 --> 15:24.110
What do you mean, why?

15:24.220 --> 15:27.650
Really. Why are we here?

15:33.730 --> 15:35.250
To be alone.

15:39.670 --> 15:40.960
"Alone."

15:53.750 --> 15:55.940
- Throw out the ice.
- The Coke's hot.

15:56.050 --> 15:59.540
Yeah, but you don't know
what kind of water is in there.

16:12.130 --> 16:16.300
Jesus Christ. Why can't you just relax?
Why are you so stressed?

16:16.400 --> 16:20.030
You are the reason I'm stressed.
You're the reason why I can't relax.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.970
You could if you tried.

16:25.710 --> 16:27.680
You don't think I tried?

16:36.460 --> 16:39.050
You're never gonna forgive me,
are you?

16:49.900 --> 16:52.170
You know what I'm talking about.

16:54.310 --> 16:56.280
Hey. I'm not gonna argue.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.950
Okay.

17:08.590 --> 17:11.460
You just let me know
when you're ready to argue.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.460
If you're not gonna run away again.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.580
- Honey? What happened?
- I'm okay.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.310
Honey, what happened?
What happened?

19:22.420 --> 19:24.050
You're bleeding, you're bleeding.

19:25.590 --> 19:27.490
- Oh, my God!
- She's been shot!

19:27.590 --> 19:29.030
Jesus. What happened?

19:29.130 --> 19:31.760
You're bleeding. Oh, my God!

19:33.370 --> 19:35.030
Stop the bus!

19:36.970 --> 19:38.400
- What happened?
- Stop the bus!

20:17.210 --> 20:18.870
The ball was out.

20:23.720 --> 20:24.840
That was out.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.720
No, it was good.

20:26.950 --> 20:27.920
That was out.

20:31.260 --> 20:33.280
I'm deaf, not blind.

20:34.630 --> 20:35.720
You're out.

20:54.880 --> 20:59.950
You shouldn't have lost your temper.
We lost the game.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.790
It wasn't my fault,
it was the ref.

21:04.060 --> 21:08.500
If you hadn't been thrown out,
we would've won the game.

21:11.130 --> 21:13.220
Why are you
in a bad mood?

21:14.570 --> 21:18.370
She's always in a bad mood
because nobody's fucked her yet.

21:19.440 --> 21:22.380
I'm gonna fuck your dad
to get rid of my mood.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.550
I'll see you at the J-Pop.

21:49.870 --> 21:52.340
What do you want to eat?

21:53.970 --> 21:57.270
I said I'd meet my friends
from the team at J-Pop.

21:58.310 --> 22:01.800
Didn't you tell me
we would have lunch together?

22:01.980 --> 22:04.610
Dad, I told you I was
going to eat with them.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.580
You never pay attention to me.

22:17.160 --> 22:20.830
My mother always
paid attention to me.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.600
Why do you want to fight?

22:35.080 --> 22:40.610
I miss your mother too.

22:47.790 --> 22:51.160
I'm doing the best I can.

23:09.050 --> 23:11.920
Don't forget
the dentist at three.

23:17.090 --> 23:18.420
Take care.

23:52.590 --> 23:53.750
Do you have a table?

24:07.240 --> 24:09.440
Why all the way in the corner?

24:12.810 --> 24:14.580
Isn't the view nice?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.700
Do you like him?

25:06.330 --> 25:07.530
Hello.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.800
Hello.

25:19.850 --> 25:21.180
Can I play with you?

25:22.820 --> 25:24.810
Or you can
have a drink with us?

25:27.550 --> 25:29.350
Tell him to speak slowly.

25:29.890 --> 25:32.790
Can you say that
a little slower?

25:47.240 --> 25:49.900
You assholes,
how embarrassing.

26:10.530 --> 26:11.830
What's the matter?

26:13.530 --> 26:16.760
They look at us
like we're monsters.

26:16.870 --> 26:18.600
Oh, come off it.

26:33.620 --> 26:34.880
What are you doing?

26:35.220 --> 26:38.350
Now they're going to meet
the real hairy monster.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.210
<i>Don't forget your appointment
with the dentist. Papa.</i>

27:38.020 --> 27:39.350
I have to go.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.220
I'll see you at your place, then.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.190
What are you doing here?

28:25.030 --> 28:27.060
Something we ate
gave us a stomach ache.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.530
The goats will die
if they don't eat.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.660
Wash your face
and take them out again.

28:31.770 --> 28:33.200
My stomach hurts.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.870
There are other
chores to do then.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.410
Move it. Let's go.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.770
God bless. Bye, bye.

29:14.310 --> 29:16.710
Thank you,
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.380
Tell your mother
to prepare dinner.

29:40.310 --> 29:42.210
Did you kill any jackals?

29:42.540 --> 29:45.670
We shot at them,
but didn't hit any.

29:46.150 --> 29:49.410
You have to kill them.
If not, they're going to eat all the goats.

29:49.820 --> 29:51.480
Why did you come home late?

29:52.490 --> 29:55.750
They closed the road,
we took the long way.

29:58.060 --> 30:01.760
Apparently some terrorists
killed an American tourist.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.630
An American?

30:03.860 --> 30:06.490
Yes, the terrorists attacked
a tour bus on the road.

30:07.900 --> 30:10.170
No, there aren't any terrorists here.

30:11.300 --> 30:12.290
You never know.

30:18.140 --> 30:19.940
How do you know
the American died?

30:20.050 --> 30:24.450
That's what they were saying.
The police are looking for the culprits.

31:23.710 --> 31:25.870
You see how easy it is
to get into paradise?

31:25.980 --> 31:27.210
Is this Mexico?

31:27.380 --> 31:29.040
Yes, this is Mexico.

31:29.250 --> 31:32.380
My mom told me
that Mexico is really dangerous.

31:32.590 --> 31:35.350
Yeah... it's full of Mexicans.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.720
Don't talk like that.

31:37.390 --> 31:38.450
It's not true.

31:43.630 --> 31:46.000
I mean, yeah, it's full of Mexicans, but...

33:18.360 --> 33:22.760
How wonderful, you made it.

33:23.630 --> 33:25.500
You decided to bring them?

33:25.730 --> 33:26.960
Hey, what's up?

33:30.470 --> 33:33.700
Oh, son, look how handsome.

33:34.170 --> 33:36.300
You look like Julio Preciado.

33:36.410 --> 33:40.370
Forget Julio Preciado,
he looks like Luis Miguel.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.570
Debbie. Mike.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.710
These are the kids
I take care of.

33:46.820 --> 33:48.310
Say hi to Luis.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.750
Lucio, come here.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.120
This is Mike and Debbie.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.750
He's called Lucio.
He's gonna take care of you, okay?

33:56.860 --> 33:59.060
Take them to play.

34:07.670 --> 34:11.340
Mom, I don't know how you did it,
but it zipped up perfectly.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.670
And it's been 15 years
since I wore this dress.

34:14.150 --> 34:15.980
You haven't changed a bit, Ma.

34:16.080 --> 34:19.420
Working dear, hard work...
that's what keeps you young.

34:21.550 --> 34:22.920
What are you guys laughing about?

34:23.020 --> 34:24.720
Nothing Ma, nothing.

34:40.110 --> 34:43.560
I'll give a buck to the first
who catches a chicken.

34:45.410 --> 34:47.540
Careful with the 'huevos.'

34:56.760 --> 34:58.380
Very good, Debbie got one.

35:01.630 --> 35:02.820
Debbie's the winner.

35:02.930 --> 35:05.090
Okay, now we need another five.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.060
So we have five chickens here.

35:07.470 --> 35:09.400
Okay, now who's going to help me?

35:10.940 --> 35:13.060
You? Okay, come.

35:13.470 --> 35:15.100
Hold it tight, like this.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.010
Grab it right.

35:21.110 --> 35:25.850
Everyone back up...
give me some room.

35:41.970 --> 35:43.530
Someone, help!

35:59.420 --> 36:01.650
Is anybody a doctor? Please, a doctor!

36:08.060 --> 36:11.390
- Where's the nearest hospital?
- It's far away. About four hours.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.490
- Is there anything closer?
- There's a clinic.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.800
But on the south. In the bus
it will take us an hour and a half.

36:16.900 --> 36:20.600
- Away from Ouarzazate?
- Yes. It's the closest thing we've got.

36:22.740 --> 36:24.370
Get down!

36:24.940 --> 36:26.740
- Put that there.
- Okay.

36:30.180 --> 36:33.020
Stop! Stop!

36:34.790 --> 36:36.910
We need your help.
My wife's been injured.

36:37.620 --> 36:40.790
I need your help. Help. Hospital.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.720
Help, come here.
Tell him we need his help!

36:42.830 --> 36:47.430
No, wait! Wait! Wait!
Stop him! Stop him!

37:01.210 --> 37:03.980
Ouarzazate isn't this way.
They're going to start shooting at us.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.310
- Turn the bus around, Anwar!
- It hurts.

37:06.420 --> 37:08.980
- Turn back. Turn the bus around!
- It really hurts.

37:10.890 --> 37:14.520
We got to get somewhere closer.
Is there anywhere else we can take her?

37:14.630 --> 37:16.090
We can take her to my town.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.960
It's near here, and there is a doctor.
We can call Erfoud for an ambulance.

37:21.770 --> 37:23.200
Okay. Okay.

39:08.540 --> 39:10.370
Watch her shoulder!
Watch her shoulder!

39:10.480 --> 39:11.530
Okay. Okay.

39:15.580 --> 39:18.180
- Turn this way.
- No, no.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.950
Through the next door. Come on.

39:35.430 --> 39:37.770
We got to call an ambulance.
I need to call my embassy.

39:37.870 --> 39:40.270
Okay. If you have the number
of your embassy, I can go call.

39:40.370 --> 39:41.500
Where are you going?

39:41.610 --> 39:43.540
I'll make the call.
Okay, I got to go make a call.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.630
- Please don't leave me here alone.
- You're going to be all right.

39:45.750 --> 39:46.730
- Can she help?
- Yeah, yeah.

39:46.850 --> 39:48.280
Where are you going? Please
don't leave me here alone.

39:48.380 --> 39:49.470
- Can she help?
- Yes.

39:49.580 --> 39:51.910
Listen, listen. It's gonna be all right.
I'm just gonna go make a call.

39:52.020 --> 39:54.920
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Tell her
she has to keep pressure right here.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.610
She cannot let go.
Does she understand?

39:56.720 --> 39:57.710
Yes.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.760
I'm just gonna make sure help's
on the way. I'm coming right back.

39:59.860 --> 40:01.990
- Please don't leave me.
- Does she understand?

40:02.090 --> 40:03.860
- I'll be right back.
- Richard, no, don't leave me here.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.800
- I'll be right back.
- Richard, don't. Richard!

40:06.900 --> 40:09.770
I'll be back, sweetheart.
Just gonna make the call.

40:11.670 --> 40:14.370
- How's your wife?
- It's bad. I can't stop the bleeding.

40:14.470 --> 40:16.870
- Get her out of there and let's go.
- Where? Where do I take her?

40:16.980 --> 40:19.810
In Egypt in a town like this
they slit 30 German tourists' throats.

40:19.910 --> 40:21.240
- They might do the same to us.
- No, sir, not here.

40:21.350 --> 40:23.510
What do you know? We've got to get
out of here as soon as possible.

40:23.620 --> 40:24.610
It's unbearably hot.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.980
- We have to get back for our children.
- Look, you can't leave us here.

40:27.090 --> 40:28.820
- What is the point in our staying?
- In case we need the bus!

40:28.920 --> 40:29.910
He can drop us off
and come back for you.

40:30.020 --> 40:31.110
- No.
- I'll stay with you if you need me.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.820
Please just wait. Let me figure this out.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.520
We're not gonna risk our lives, so hurry.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.070
I need your phone.
I will pay.

41:14.670 --> 41:17.190
Rachel? Rachel? It's Richard. Listen.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.240
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

41:19.340 --> 41:22.470
We're still... Listen, listen.
There's been an accident.

41:22.580 --> 41:26.170
Your sister's been shot.
She's been shot.

41:26.780 --> 41:28.770
I don't know. I don't know.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.440
<i>- She's hit in the neck.
- Oh, my God!</i>

41:30.550 --> 41:32.950
Listen, listen, I need you
to call the embassy

41:33.050 --> 41:37.180
and tell them what happened.
And call Mark, okay? Call Mark.

41:37.590 --> 41:39.060
<i>Where are you?</i>

41:39.330 --> 41:40.690
Where are we?

41:41.160 --> 41:44.030
Tazarine. Three hours
southwest of Erfoud.

41:44.130 --> 41:48.230
Tazarine. T-A-Z-A-R-I-N-E.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.860
Three hours southwest of Erfoud.

41:52.100 --> 41:53.730
It's in the desert. It's a village.

41:53.840 --> 41:57.000
<i>- How are we supposed to find you?
- Listen, listen, listen!</i>

41:57.110 --> 41:58.270
<i>- This is urgent, okay?
- Okay.</i>

41:58.380 --> 42:00.970
Call the embassy. They will help us.
And call James!

42:10.690 --> 42:12.350
This is the doctor.

42:32.750 --> 42:33.940
Easy.

42:46.060 --> 42:48.290
Easy, easy. Easy! Easy!

42:48.390 --> 42:49.760
I can't, I can't.

42:52.160 --> 42:53.630
Tell him, easy.

42:53.730 --> 42:55.760
The bullet didn't
touch her spine.

42:56.500 --> 43:00.770
If she stays like this,
she will bleed to death.

43:00.870 --> 43:01.900
What did he say?

43:02.010 --> 43:03.500
He says

43:04.310 --> 43:05.540
she will be fine.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.640
Don't you fucking lie to me.
You tell me what he said.

43:07.750 --> 43:09.580
Tell me what he said!

43:11.220 --> 43:13.120
Hospital. Hospital.

43:13.220 --> 43:14.520
I know, hospital! What can you do?

43:14.620 --> 43:16.380
Is there anything
we can do?

43:16.490 --> 43:18.920
I have to stitch up the wound
to stop the bleeding.

43:19.020 --> 43:21.420
He says he need to sew up the wounds.

43:21.530 --> 43:23.090
What did he say?

43:25.160 --> 43:27.790
He said you need some stitches, honey.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.460
Stitches? What do you mean, stitches?

43:32.570 --> 43:34.800
- What kind of doctor is he?
- He's a veterinarian. But he is good.

43:34.910 --> 43:37.430
And tell him
her clavicle is broken.

43:38.340 --> 43:41.800
He says she has a broken bone
and he has to put a splint on it.

43:41.910 --> 43:45.610
If he doesn't sew up her wound,
she might bleed to death.

43:45.720 --> 43:47.550
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- Richard.

43:49.920 --> 43:50.910
No, no, no, Richard.

43:51.020 --> 43:53.120
We have to
hold her down.

43:53.230 --> 43:56.680
- Richard. Richard. No, no, no, no.
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.990
- Richard, don't let him.
- Honey, we have to do this.

44:06.970 --> 44:09.670
It's still bleeding. We got to stop
the bleeding. You gotta do this.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.300
- We have to do this.
- No, no, don't let him.

44:11.410 --> 44:12.540
- Listen to me.
- No, no, no, please.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.770
No, no, no, no. Richard, don't.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.110
- No!
- You got to be still.

44:18.220 --> 44:21.310
- Richard, don't let him! No.
- You got to be still.

44:22.090 --> 44:24.060
Be strong, be strong.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.110
Here are the sterilized drill bits.

44:56.920 --> 44:59.120
You have cavities
in two molars.

45:24.150 --> 45:25.380
What are you doing?

45:36.800 --> 45:37.820
What's wrong with you?

45:49.980 --> 45:50.960
Get out.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.080
Get out right now.

46:37.360 --> 46:39.290
Yes, I'll let him know.

46:42.430 --> 46:44.990
That's Mr. Wataya's daughter.

46:45.560 --> 46:46.860
Thank you.

46:51.540 --> 46:54.230
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

46:54.870 --> 46:57.670
She's deaf-mute...

46:57.840 --> 47:02.680
Face her when you speak
so she can read your lips.

47:05.550 --> 47:07.850
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

47:10.590 --> 47:16.290
We are Yoshjo Hamano and Kenji
Mamiya of the Metropolitan Police.

47:18.830 --> 47:20.890
We would like
to see your father.

47:33.580 --> 47:40.250
No, it's nothing bad.
We just want to talk to him.

47:40.590 --> 47:42.710
Do you know
where he is?

47:45.020 --> 47:48.890
Please tell him to call.

47:51.660 --> 47:54.900
Don't be scared.
We just want to talk to him.

47:58.600 --> 47:59.630
Thank you.

48:10.120 --> 48:14.480
<i>Chieko, I waited for you.
I have a meeting so I'll be back late.</i>

48:14.620 --> 48:16.020
<i>I left you a bento box. Papa.</i>

48:21.830 --> 48:25.820
<i>I'm on my way to your place.</i>

48:26.600 --> 48:28.430
Where are you?

48:31.600 --> 48:33.130
Hurry up!

48:51.990 --> 48:55.260
<i>Moroccan officials
are investigating suspects...</i>

48:55.360 --> 48:58.020
<i>in the shooting of
an American tourist.</i>

48:58.130 --> 49:01.930
<i>Officials said the shooting
took place...</i>

49:11.280 --> 49:12.300
Are you ready?

49:12.480 --> 49:14.140
Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag.

49:20.950 --> 49:22.580
The cops came again?

49:23.290 --> 49:26.690
Yeah. They hadn't come in nine months.
But these were different cops.

49:26.790 --> 49:28.990
Did they come to ask
about your mother's death?

49:29.260 --> 49:33.320
No, but they're probably going
to ask my dad about the same things.

49:33.430 --> 49:35.300
They're just not convinced,
are they?

49:42.370 --> 49:45.540
Believe it or not,
I liked one of the cops.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.270
Idiot.

49:48.910 --> 49:50.850
Did you put on some panties?

50:54.110 --> 50:55.700
Are you sure
it was here?

50:56.250 --> 50:58.610
An American stopped me.

50:58.750 --> 51:03.050
I was scared.
He was covered in blood.

51:04.660 --> 51:05.990
Where was the bus stopped?

51:06.090 --> 51:07.220
Over there.

51:08.030 --> 51:10.360
<i>Captain Alarid... Captain Alarid.</i>

51:11.660 --> 51:12.650
<i>I found cartridges.</i>

51:18.970 --> 51:21.840
We found four.
Here's one.

51:29.950 --> 51:31.070
Did you search all over?

51:31.420 --> 51:32.610
Yes, the whole mountain.

51:52.100 --> 51:53.300
They're from around here.

51:54.570 --> 51:56.630
Find out who has
a .270 caliber rifle.

52:23.970 --> 52:24.990
Hassan Ibrahim?

52:25.100 --> 52:26.470
- Yes.
- Drop your weapon.

52:26.570 --> 52:27.600
I don't have a weapon.

52:27.710 --> 52:28.700
Drop it now.

52:28.810 --> 52:29.900
I told you to drop
your weapon.

52:30.010 --> 52:31.100
This is just my knife.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.240
Get on the ground.

52:33.350 --> 52:34.330
What did we do?

52:34.450 --> 52:35.780
Get down on the ground...
face down.

52:38.420 --> 52:39.480
Don't look at me.

52:40.590 --> 52:41.880
What did we do?

52:47.490 --> 52:50.690
Take these skins to Najib,
see if he wants to buy them.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.710
Why did you shoot at the bus?

53:13.550 --> 53:15.780
I didn't shoot at anyone.

53:17.060 --> 53:18.180
Then who?

53:25.460 --> 53:27.160
It wasn't me.

53:31.500 --> 53:33.300
That was your rifle.

53:37.380 --> 53:39.280
I sold it yesterday.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.680
Who did you sell it to?

54:11.380 --> 54:13.870
Do you know where
Abdullah Adboum lives?

54:15.180 --> 54:16.670
Yes.

54:16.920 --> 54:19.180
You have to go over those mountains.

54:23.990 --> 54:25.550
Who lives
in this area?

54:25.660 --> 54:28.990
We live here with our mother.
Abdullah lives on the other side.

54:32.700 --> 54:37.900
If you're lying, I'm going to
come back and cut your balls off.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.270
You can come back
anytime you like.

54:49.380 --> 54:51.370
Don't walk
between the graves.

55:14.110 --> 55:15.630
Papa... Papa...

55:15.740 --> 55:16.760
What happened?

55:16.910 --> 55:19.000
The police...
they're looking for you.

55:19.110 --> 55:20.310
Me? Why?

55:20.580 --> 55:22.950
No, not for you...
they're looking for us.

55:23.080 --> 55:24.410
Looking for you?
Why?

55:25.220 --> 55:26.950
Because of the tourist.

55:27.450 --> 55:28.510
What tourist?

55:28.650 --> 55:30.420
The American...
Yussef killed her.

55:30.590 --> 55:31.650
Liar, we both did.

55:31.990 --> 55:33.150
What are you saying?

55:33.360 --> 55:35.190
Yussef started shooting
at the cars...

55:35.560 --> 55:37.030
because Hassan said
that the bullet could go far.

55:37.130 --> 55:38.960
Liar, you started shooting at the cars.

55:39.100 --> 55:40.120
But you killed her.

55:40.230 --> 55:41.600
What are you saying?

55:41.700 --> 55:44.530
Yussef killed the American
and he spies on Zohra naked...

55:44.640 --> 55:46.430
and Zohra lets him watch her.

55:46.770 --> 55:47.930
That's garbage.

55:48.270 --> 55:51.540
It's not garbage.
She's a street girl and he spies on her.

55:59.180 --> 56:01.310
Time to drink!

56:28.650 --> 56:33.110
This song is dedicated
from Luis to Patricia...

56:33.220 --> 56:35.190
the most beautiful bride
in the world.

57:08.920 --> 57:13.860
I think Aunt Amelia has to dance.

58:02.470 --> 58:05.030
Amelia, can I have this dance?

58:05.940 --> 58:08.210
I don't think your wife
would like that.

58:08.310 --> 58:13.050
Ohh, she passed away 10 years ago.
Come on Amelia.

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:03.110
Let's go dance... You have
something white on your face.

1:01:03.220 --> 1:01:05.450
Don't get excited,
it's only cake.

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:22.200
<i>Today, near Tazarine,
there was an incident.</i>

1:01:22.310 --> 1:01:24.070
<i>An American was shot.</i>

1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:29.040
<i>Authorities say it
could have been a robbery.</i>

1:01:29.150 --> 1:01:32.910
<i>But, the American government was
quick to suggest a terrorist link.</i>

1:01:33.020 --> 1:01:35.180
<i>Minister Hassan Hazal
has said...</i>

1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:39.760
<i>that terrorist cells have been
eradicated in our country...</i>

1:01:39.860 --> 1:01:43.090
<i>and one act
of vulgar banditry...</i>

1:01:43.190 --> 1:01:48.060
<i>followed by superficial evaluations
the U.S. places on it...</i>

1:01:48.170 --> 1:01:50.460
<i>cannot ruin our image
or the economy.</i>

1:01:56.980 --> 1:01:58.570
I want to call the kids.

1:02:00.210 --> 1:02:02.270
Richard, I want to talk to the kids.

1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:03.940
We can't move you right now.

1:02:04.050 --> 1:02:06.880
- We'll call them later.
- I want to talk to the kids.

1:02:08.390 --> 1:02:10.080
I got to talk to them.

1:02:22.730 --> 1:02:24.700
I got to talk to the kids.

1:03:55.090 --> 1:03:58.760
You have to turn on the
air-conditioning, my husband is ill.

1:03:58.860 --> 1:04:01.920
No air-conditioning,
no gasoline near. I'm sorry.

1:04:02.030 --> 1:04:05.970
Please, it's too hot.
We can get dehydrated.

1:04:06.070 --> 1:04:07.040
What did he say?

1:04:07.170 --> 1:04:08.500
He says we can't turn on
the air-conditioning

1:04:08.610 --> 1:04:10.470
because it uses the gas.

1:04:11.140 --> 1:04:13.610
Oh, fuck that. Come on.

1:04:15.910 --> 1:04:17.210
Fuck you.

1:04:22.790 --> 1:04:24.080
Tom, where are you going?

1:04:24.190 --> 1:04:26.990
Get back. Wait there. Get back.

1:04:32.460 --> 1:04:34.860
- Look, we're leaving.
- You're not leaving us.

1:04:34.970 --> 1:04:37.300
There's old people here.
The heat is really getting...

1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:38.460
Wait for the ambulance,
and then you can leave.

1:04:38.570 --> 1:04:40.000
There's a man in the bus
who almost fainted,

1:04:40.100 --> 1:04:42.570
and there's a woman who needs to
get back in time to take her medication.

1:04:42.670 --> 1:04:45.140
- We can't leave him here.
- Well, let him come, then.

1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:46.940
His wife's in no condition to travel.

1:04:47.050 --> 1:04:48.770
There's people in no condition
to be kept waiting.

1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:50.010
Can't you see that?

1:04:50.110 --> 1:04:53.450
Please wait. The ambulance
is gonna be here any minute, right?

1:04:53.550 --> 1:04:55.180
It's gonna be here any minute.

1:04:55.290 --> 1:04:57.810
So I'm asking you all to please wait.

1:05:01.190 --> 1:05:04.360
Thirty minutes.
We're giving you thirty minutes.

1:05:45.740 --> 1:05:47.070
Who are they?

1:05:48.110 --> 1:05:49.440
My cousins.

1:05:49.540 --> 1:05:50.940
Is he deaf-mute
like us?

1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:53.100
No, but he understands some.

1:05:59.250 --> 1:06:01.120
What is your name?

1:06:10.430 --> 1:06:11.860
Chieko.

1:06:12.770 --> 1:06:15.530
My name's Haruki.

1:06:32.650 --> 1:06:34.710
It's whisky.

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:53.100
Do the cops come around here?

1:06:54.380 --> 1:06:55.840
Sometimes.

1:09:31.570 --> 1:09:33.040
You smell good.

1:14:34.350 --> 1:14:36.940
Welcome home... may I help you?

1:14:47.300 --> 1:14:51.030
Are you sure
you want him to come now?

1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:09.380
Is this Detective Mamiya?

1:15:10.720 --> 1:15:14.990
The deaf-mute girl you met this
afternoon asked me to call.

1:15:15.090 --> 1:15:17.250
Yes, her.

1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:23.700
She says she needs to talk to you,
alone... about her father.

1:15:25.670 --> 1:15:27.000
Why did you do this?

1:15:28.410 --> 1:15:29.770
Why did you do this?

1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:33.870
Answer me, damn it!

1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:37.480
We were testing the rifle.

1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:40.650
Are you idiots?

1:15:41.050 --> 1:15:43.540
You killed a woman.

1:15:44.790 --> 1:15:46.150
And you...

1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:49.260
You got naked
so your brother could watch?

1:15:51.290 --> 1:15:54.320
Zohra got naked lots of times
so Yussef could watch her.

1:15:54.570 --> 1:15:56.030
Is it true or not?

1:16:00.340 --> 1:16:01.830
Is it true or not?

1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:19.350
Why did you do this to us?

1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:22.880
Where's the rifle?

1:16:24.860 --> 1:16:25.960
Where's the rifle?

1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:28.860
I told you,
a hunter gave it to me.

1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:30.530
What hunter?

1:16:32.810 --> 1:16:39.040
A Japanese hunter...
gave it to me.

1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:43.610
I've got a picture.
She can get it.

1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:45.180
Go get it.

1:17:09.580 --> 1:17:13.910
He's holding the rifle
he gave me.

1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:41.270
We're going to Najib's house.

1:17:41.410 --> 1:17:44.470
If the cops come,
tell them we went south.

1:18:03.070 --> 1:18:05.530
This Abdullah doesn't live
in the area you told us.

1:18:05.670 --> 1:18:06.660
Are you playing with us?

1:18:07.900 --> 1:18:10.130
He lives in the area
he told you.

1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:12.230
He lives there?

1:18:12.710 --> 1:18:15.180
You're going to take us.

1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:55.950
They're over there.

1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:01.860
The police, the police.

1:19:02.290 --> 1:19:03.620
Run... run.

1:19:30.460 --> 1:19:31.510
Get down.

1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:41.220
Mom, stay here tonight.

1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:45.320
I can't, I have to get these kids home.
It's almost dawn.

1:20:45.530 --> 1:20:47.530
But this fucking guy
is really drunk.

1:20:47.770 --> 1:20:52.000
Drunk my ass. I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:54.670
Stay a little while,
the party's just starting.

1:20:54.780 --> 1:20:57.800
I would like to, but these kids
have soccer practice tomorrow.

1:20:57.910 --> 1:20:58.970
See you soon, Son.

1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:01.170
Congratulations, my darling.

1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:06.150
Take care of my grandchild.
I'm dying to be a grandmother.

1:21:06.290 --> 1:21:07.690
Seriously, you're not drunk man?

1:21:07.790 --> 1:21:11.230
Drunk my ass.
I'm fine. I'll be back.

1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:15.320
Remember, they got you once already
and you got in a lot of trouble.

1:21:16.270 --> 1:21:17.530
Bye, Ma...

1:21:17.670 --> 1:21:21.200
If things don't work here,
I'll meet you with the 'gringos.'

1:21:53.470 --> 1:21:55.170
Hey, be careful.

1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:04.610
I'll cross the border
through Tecate...

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:07.520
that will get us to
San Diego super fast.

1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:27.830
Papers?

1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:33.540
- Where you coming from?
- From Mexico.

1:22:36.650 --> 1:22:38.520
From a wedding.

1:22:40.020 --> 1:22:41.320
Where you from?

1:22:41.620 --> 1:22:43.520
From Valle de Guadalupe.

1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:48.030
Valle de Guadalupe.

1:22:48.630 --> 1:22:49.990
Where you headed today?

1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:53.500
To San Diego. We're going...
I'm taking them.

1:22:56.200 --> 1:22:58.170
- Who are they?
- Her nephews.

1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:00.740
Her nephews.
They don't look like you, ma'am.

1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:03.670
No, no, no, no. I'm in charge of them.

1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:06.400
- Do you have their passports?
- Yes.

1:23:21.630 --> 1:23:23.330
Is there a problem?

1:23:26.770 --> 1:23:28.290
Should there be one?

1:23:35.510 --> 1:23:37.380
Wait right here just a minute.

1:23:43.550 --> 1:23:46.580
Don't say anything.
Let me do the talking.

1:23:46.890 --> 1:23:48.910
But you're provoking him.

1:23:49.030 --> 1:23:50.790
I was just kidding.

1:23:52.730 --> 1:23:54.700
Can you open your trunk, sir?

1:23:55.330 --> 1:23:56.990
- What?
- Open your trunk.

1:23:57.100 --> 1:23:58.400
Yes, yes, yes.

1:24:25.630 --> 1:24:27.060
Close it up.

1:24:30.370 --> 1:24:32.100
Get back in the vehicle.

1:24:34.910 --> 1:24:36.870
Glove compartment, ma'am.

1:24:43.980 --> 1:24:45.310
Purse?

1:25:08.540 --> 1:25:09.740
All right.

1:25:14.850 --> 1:25:18.580
What now?
Motherfucker...

1:25:25.690 --> 1:25:26.720
Ma'am?

1:25:26.830 --> 1:25:28.490
- You said you were in charge of them?
- Yes.

1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:31.460
We need the parents' letters
of permission.

1:25:31.970 --> 1:25:33.490
Parents' letters?

1:25:34.030 --> 1:25:35.560
What's that?

1:25:54.690 --> 1:25:55.950
Hey there, sweetie.

1:25:56.390 --> 1:25:58.590
Tell me, is this lady here your auntie?

1:25:59.230 --> 1:26:01.130
No, she's not my auntie.

1:26:03.060 --> 1:26:04.500
She's in charge.

1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:06.120
- Are you drunk, sir?
- Me?

1:26:06.230 --> 1:26:08.330
- Are you intoxicated?
- No.

1:26:08.740 --> 1:26:10.760
Sir, I'm gonna ask you
to step out the vehicle.

1:26:10.870 --> 1:26:13.740
- Why?
- I need you to step out the vehicle now.

1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:15.970
I need you to step out the vehicle now!

1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:18.010
- Sir, can I explain?
- No, you cannot explain!

1:26:18.110 --> 1:26:20.880
I'm telling you
that you will step out the vehicle!

1:26:20.980 --> 1:26:23.080
Don't make me ask you again!

1:26:23.190 --> 1:26:25.350
Wait, sir. Get back into the vehicle.

1:26:25.450 --> 1:26:27.150
What you're gonna do now
is you're gonna follow me

1:26:27.260 --> 1:26:28.420
to the secondary inspection area.

1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:29.820
- Can I explain?
- No, you cannot explain.

1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:31.550
Sir, you will shut your mouth
and you will follow me...

1:26:31.660 --> 1:26:34.290
I heard you... stop shouting.

1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:36.230
You will park your vehicle
and you will get out.

1:26:36.330 --> 1:26:37.460
Don't shout at me.

1:26:37.570 --> 1:26:40.330
You will shut your mouth and you will
do as you're told. Follow me!

1:26:40.470 --> 1:26:41.940
Stop shouting at me.

1:26:42.810 --> 1:26:44.500
Step out of the vehicle as told.

1:26:44.610 --> 1:26:46.470
Easy Santiago, please.

1:26:49.550 --> 1:26:53.410
Upon passing this van, you'll turn to
the right and park your vehicle.

1:27:09.930 --> 1:27:11.770
I got a port runner.

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:13.330
What are you doing?

1:27:14.410 --> 1:27:18.430
I got a port runner! Tecate border!
Officer Brigg, Tecate border!

1:27:22.250 --> 1:27:24.940
What are you doing, Santiago?
What are you doing!

1:27:25.050 --> 1:27:28.320
See, I told you!
You shouldn't have brought them.

1:27:28.420 --> 1:27:32.020
Santiago, stop acting like a
madman and stop the car.

1:27:33.060 --> 1:27:34.150
Please, Santiago, stop!

1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:37.290
Shut those kids up!
Shut them up!

1:27:59.390 --> 1:28:01.150
Sweetie, everything is okay.

1:28:04.220 --> 1:28:05.280
Don't cry.

1:28:05.390 --> 1:28:07.520
Please stop, Santiago.

1:28:12.930 --> 1:28:18.170
Motherfuckers, fucking gringo assholes,
here they come.

1:29:02.990 --> 1:29:04.010
Get out. Get out.

1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:05.310
Are you crazy? Where?

1:29:05.450 --> 1:29:08.720
Get out. If they catch us,
we're all screwed...

1:29:08.860 --> 1:29:11.420
I'll lose them,
then come back for you.

1:29:11.530 --> 1:29:12.690
Get out, for Christ sake!

1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:15.020
Santiago, calm down.

1:29:15.430 --> 1:29:19.930
Aunt Amelia, get out...
for the love of God!

1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:22.330
Get out, kids.

1:29:28.780 --> 1:29:30.800
Come on, come on, get out!

1:29:43.260 --> 1:29:46.090
Santiago is going to
come back soon and...

1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:48.760
the sun is going to rise.

1:29:55.910 --> 1:29:58.000
I want to go home now.

1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:01.270
Be careful, baby.

1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:51.460
Thank you.

1:31:04.340 --> 1:31:05.780
Is that your daughter?

1:31:06.610 --> 1:31:09.140
Yes. The third of five.

1:31:12.550 --> 1:31:15.250
- Do you have kids?
- Yeah.

1:31:38.350 --> 1:31:41.080
- Just two?
- Yeah.

1:31:43.820 --> 1:31:45.510
You should have more.

1:31:56.600 --> 1:31:59.190
What about you?
How many wives you have?

1:32:00.240 --> 1:32:02.100
I can only afford one.

1:32:15.650 --> 1:32:17.450
Come on! Find another ambulance!
Do something!

1:32:17.550 --> 1:32:19.350
Why can't you call
another ambulance?

1:32:19.460 --> 1:32:21.860
They just told me
the ambulance isn't coming.

1:32:21.960 --> 1:32:24.290
And you know we don't
have another ambulance.

1:32:26.330 --> 1:32:28.160
There isn't another ambulance.

1:32:28.270 --> 1:32:30.530
What do you mean, there's no
other ambulance? What do you mean?

1:32:30.630 --> 1:32:34.070
Fucking move! Fucking find me
an ambulance! Find me an ambulance!

1:32:34.170 --> 1:32:36.470
He wants to know how
he will get his wife out of here.

1:32:36.570 --> 1:32:39.510
Tell him they said
his embassy will deal with it.

1:32:39.980 --> 1:32:42.310
- Your embassy will deal with it.
- What can my embassy do?

1:32:42.410 --> 1:32:45.350
This is your fucked-up country! It's your
responsibility! You do something!

1:32:45.450 --> 1:32:48.180
The Americans
stopped the ambulance.

1:32:48.290 --> 1:32:51.150
They want to send a helicopter,
but there are problems.

1:32:51.260 --> 1:32:53.280
He says it's your embassy
who stopped the ambulance

1:32:53.390 --> 1:32:54.820
and they will send a helicopter.

1:32:54.930 --> 1:32:58.830
Now I'm supposed to wait for
a helicopter? Fucking do something!

1:32:59.400 --> 1:33:01.370
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1:33:05.170 --> 1:33:06.730
- How's your wife?
- We can't stay here any longer.

1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:08.670
- Stay away from me.
- It's gonna get dark soon.

1:33:08.770 --> 1:33:11.300
People are not feeling well.
It's dangerous.

1:33:11.410 --> 1:33:13.210
Don't you push me!

1:33:13.310 --> 1:33:15.210
Fuck that! We're leaving!

1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:19.840
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1:33:19.990 --> 1:33:21.280
Take it easy!

1:33:21.390 --> 1:33:23.680
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Calm down. Come here.

1:33:24.790 --> 1:33:26.380
- Get off me!
- Calm down!

1:33:26.790 --> 1:33:29.660
If you leave, I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

1:33:30.260 --> 1:33:32.200
Come with us. Come with us.

1:33:32.300 --> 1:33:33.700
Are you all right?

1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:38.970
No, we need help now.
We need help now. Do you understand?

1:33:39.070 --> 1:33:41.470
<i>I'm doing everything I can do.
I've got the State Department</i>

1:33:41.570 --> 1:33:42.940
<i>on the other line right now.</i>

1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:44.240
<i>They're doing everything they can do.</i>

1:33:44.340 --> 1:33:46.210
<i>Due to some political problems
that are being resolved...</i>

1:33:46.310 --> 1:33:48.840
I don't give a shit about
political problems. I need help now.

1:33:48.950 --> 1:33:53.210
<i>Everybody is doing everything they can.
Okay? I don't know what else I can do.</i>

1:33:53.320 --> 1:33:54.750
<i>It's all over the news.</i>

1:33:54.850 --> 1:33:59.120
<i>Everybody is paying attention
and doing everything that they can.</i>

1:33:59.230 --> 1:34:00.280
<i>Richard...</i>

1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:17.670
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1:35:11.030 --> 1:35:12.090
Good evening.

1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:15.430
The doorman called to say
you wanted to talk to me.

1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:16.630
I don't understand.

1:35:16.740 --> 1:35:19.270
Could you speak slowly?

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:22.300
I'm sorry.

1:35:23.810 --> 1:35:27.250
What was it
you wanted to tell me?

1:35:42.070 --> 1:35:44.260
Do you have tea?

1:36:15.530 --> 1:36:19.160
<i>"My father had nothing to do
with my mother's death."</i>

1:36:22.610 --> 1:36:23.740
What's this?

1:36:43.930 --> 1:36:49.270
When your mother jumped off the
balcony, your father was asleep?

1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:41.020
You saw her jump?

1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:52.460
You've already told the other officers?

1:38:06.820 --> 1:38:08.680
What are you talking about?

1:38:53.930 --> 1:38:57.370
Does your father still hunt?

1:39:14.150 --> 1:39:18.610
There was an incident involving a rifle
in your father's name.

1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:22.530
That's why we want to talk to him.
Understand?

1:40:03.740 --> 1:40:10.440
Your father isn't going to jail.
We just need to talk to him.

1:40:19.190 --> 1:40:20.380
I have to go.

1:40:23.890 --> 1:40:25.360
I really have to go.

1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:35.230
What are you doing?

1:41:46.850 --> 1:41:48.540
What are you doing?

1:41:57.520 --> 1:41:58.550
Please stop.

1:42:00.530 --> 1:42:04.220
No, this is wrong.
You're just a girl.

1:42:10.770 --> 1:42:12.290
Enough, stop it!

1:43:00.790 --> 1:43:02.090
Give me that rifle.

1:43:02.190 --> 1:43:03.180
They're going to kill us.

1:43:07.830 --> 1:43:09.020
They're going to kill us.

1:44:16.100 --> 1:44:21.440
I killed the American. I was the
only one who shot at you.

1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:30.010
They did nothing... nothing.

1:44:34.750 --> 1:44:40.920
Kill me, but save my brother, he did
nothing... nothing.

1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:54.300
Save my brother...
he did nothing.

1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:48.660
Help!

1:45:50.770 --> 1:45:52.390
Help!

1:45:53.300 --> 1:45:54.790
Help!

1:46:02.810 --> 1:46:03.940
Help!

1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:27.430
What's happening?

1:46:28.470 --> 1:46:32.100
Why are we hiding
if we didn't even do anything wrong?

1:46:32.210 --> 1:46:36.910
Because they think
we did something wrong, baby.

1:46:37.610 --> 1:46:41.180
That's not true. You're bad.

1:46:43.050 --> 1:46:46.420
No, sweetie. No, I'm not.

1:46:47.490 --> 1:46:50.290
I just did something stupid.

1:48:30.630 --> 1:48:34.070
Sweetie, I have to go look for help.

1:48:34.170 --> 1:48:38.660
- Stay here and don't move, please.
- I'm not staying here alone.

1:48:40.170 --> 1:48:43.870
Honey, you have to take care
of Debbie, baby.

1:48:45.250 --> 1:48:46.980
I'm going with you.

1:48:48.220 --> 1:48:51.910
I won't be long. I promise. Stay here.

1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:54.420
Don't move. Okay?

1:48:54.890 --> 1:48:56.860
I won't be long, baby.

1:49:56.850 --> 1:49:57.820
Drink.

1:50:52.210 --> 1:50:56.650
I have to go and get two kids
I left behind in the desert. Please?

1:50:59.090 --> 1:51:00.750
They're Americans.

1:51:00.850 --> 1:51:04.020
- When did you cross?
- I didn't cross. I live here.

1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:07.720
Please, please, help me find those kids.

1:51:07.830 --> 1:51:09.460
Stand here. Don't move.

1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:17.870
Attention, Dispatch.
I think I got the suspect.

1:51:27.150 --> 1:51:29.480
Ma'am, you're under arrest.
You want to turn around

1:51:29.580 --> 1:51:32.350
and put your hands
behind your head, please.

1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:35.350
I live with those kids, I swear!

1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:38.820
- Turn around.
- Please, sir, those kids will die!

1:51:39.460 --> 1:51:40.660
Thank you.

1:51:54.440 --> 1:51:55.470
Then we'll get you some water.

1:51:55.580 --> 1:51:58.550
They're alone.

1:52:00.350 --> 1:52:02.940
They are children,
they will die.

1:52:04.150 --> 1:52:06.210
You're gonna take me to them, okay?

1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:39.910
Ma'am, are you with them?

1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:14.980
<i>Richard?</i>

1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:21.530
What?

1:53:23.770 --> 1:53:27.600
If I die, you take care of the kids.

1:53:30.110 --> 1:53:31.970
Especially Mike. He really needs you.

1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:35.380
You're not gonna die. You can't die.
You just can't.

1:53:36.450 --> 1:53:38.750
Don't you ever leave them again.

1:53:41.450 --> 1:53:43.350
I will never leave them.

1:53:53.800 --> 1:53:56.600
- I peed my pants.
- What?

1:53:58.540 --> 1:54:02.200
I couldn't hold it in and I peed.

1:54:12.350 --> 1:54:14.220
I've got to pee again.

1:54:20.530 --> 1:54:24.090
Do you have a pan we could use?
A pan?

1:54:30.910 --> 1:54:33.000
Could you give us
a few moments alone?

1:54:33.110 --> 1:54:34.670
Yeah, of course.

1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:49.750
There.

1:54:49.860 --> 1:54:51.160
Now sit.

1:54:53.130 --> 1:54:54.430
I can't.

1:54:59.870 --> 1:55:02.340
Yep. Yeah, I can.

1:56:02.530 --> 1:56:04.360
Forgive me, my love.

1:56:07.110 --> 1:56:08.800
When Sammy died,

1:56:11.010 --> 1:56:12.240
I didn't...

1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:19.780
I ran.

1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:31.150
- I was scared.
- I was scared, too.

1:56:33.100 --> 1:56:35.470
- It wasn't my fault.
- It wasn't your fault.

1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:37.760
- It wasn't my fault.
- It wasn't your fault.

1:56:37.870 --> 1:56:39.860
He wasn't breathing.

1:56:39.970 --> 1:56:41.440
I couldn't...

1:56:44.840 --> 1:56:46.540
I love you so much.

1:56:56.920 --> 1:56:58.860
I'm forgetting his face.

1:57:00.730 --> 1:57:02.530
<i>Hello? Richard Jones?</i>

1:57:02.660 --> 1:57:04.490
<i>I'm very sorry about
what happened to your wife,</i>

1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:06.620
<i>but you can be sure that the culprits
will be punished.</i>

1:57:06.730 --> 1:57:08.170
<i>What the fuck is taking so long?</i>

1:57:08.270 --> 1:57:10.570
<i>Well, the Moroccan government
wouldn't let us use their airspace.</i>

1:57:10.670 --> 1:57:13.040
<i>They refused to acknowledge
that this was an act of terrorism.</i>

1:57:13.140 --> 1:57:14.770
<i>What about the ambulance?</i>

1:57:14.880 --> 1:57:17.340
<i>Taking your safety into consideration,
Mr. Jones, we didn't believe</i>

1:57:17.450 --> 1:57:19.970
<i>it would be appropriate
to send a Moroccan ambulance.</i>

1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:22.810
<i>Stay put. We settled the matter.
A helicopter should arrive soon.</i>

1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:24.110
<i>- How long?
- Soon.</i>

1:57:24.220 --> 1:57:25.520
<i>No! How long?</i>

1:57:32.530 --> 1:57:34.790
There's no need to apologize.

1:59:39.730 --> 1:59:41.690
It's a miracle
we found those kids, ma'am.

1:59:41.800 --> 1:59:46.100
I don't know how you could have left
them alone like that out in the desert.

1:59:47.400 --> 1:59:50.560
- How are they, sir?
- That's none of your business.

1:59:52.070 --> 1:59:55.940
You know how many kids die every year
trying to cross this border?

1:59:59.480 --> 2:00:02.710
I raised these kids since they were born.

2:00:03.420 --> 2:00:06.390
I take care of them day and night.

2:00:06.750 --> 2:00:10.020
I feed them breakfast
and lunch and dinner.

2:00:10.660 --> 2:00:12.630
I play with them.

2:00:13.660 --> 2:00:16.650
Mike and Debbie
are like my own children.

2:00:16.770 --> 2:00:19.360
But they are not your children, ma'am.

2:00:20.700 --> 2:00:23.900
Plus, you've been working
in this country illegally.

2:00:31.550 --> 2:00:34.180
What about my nephew, Santiago?

2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:36.790
I don't have any information on him.

2:00:37.590 --> 2:00:39.490
We located the father in Morocco.

2:00:39.590 --> 2:00:42.890
He was very angry,
but decided not to press charges.

2:00:43.790 --> 2:00:44.850
Thank you.

2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:46.930
Nevertheless the government
of the United States

2:00:47.030 --> 2:00:49.360
has deemed that you are
seriously breaking the law,

2:00:49.470 --> 2:00:52.920
and is determined to immediately
and definitively deport you.

2:00:55.470 --> 2:00:59.430
Sir, I've been here for 16 years.

2:01:00.980 --> 2:01:04.910
I have my things here. I rent a house.

2:01:05.450 --> 2:01:07.640
I made a life here, sir.

2:01:07.750 --> 2:01:10.620
You should have thought
about that beforehand.

2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:18.790
I want to talk to a lawyer.

2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:23.200
If you attempt to take this to trial,
I can assure you,

2:01:23.800 --> 2:01:26.640
you'll only be prolonging the inevitable.

2:01:27.770 --> 2:01:30.740
I recommend you accept
voluntary deportation.

2:05:30.420 --> 2:05:32.590
<i>The sources of the attack
are not yet known.</i>

2:05:32.690 --> 2:05:37.630
<i>But it is clear that Moroccan
and US government officials</i>

2:05:37.730 --> 2:05:42.070
<i>are working quickly
to secure the area for all citizens.</i>

2:05:42.170 --> 2:05:46.730
<i>Locals reported Susan Jones,
an American mother of two...</i>

2:05:47.480 --> 2:05:50.270
Mr. Jones, I'm Ken Clifford,
the US ambassador.

2:06:08.460 --> 2:06:11.490
We will find these people.
Whoever they are, we will find them.

2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:14.760
Thank you very much.
That's all I have to say now.

2:06:38.300 --> 2:06:39.660
Mr. Jones?

2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:44.090
I'm going to have to
operate immediately.

2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:45.670
Is she gonna be all right?

2:06:46.600 --> 2:06:49.570
It's probable.
We're gonna try to save her arm.

2:06:50.010 --> 2:06:53.000
She's been bleeding internally
and there's been some clotting,

2:06:53.110 --> 2:06:55.440
so there's a high risk of gangrene.

2:06:57.050 --> 2:06:59.180
But is she gonna be all right?

2:07:01.720 --> 2:07:03.190
Excuse me, sir.

2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:21.370
<i>- Yes?
- Amelia?</i>

2:07:22.470 --> 2:07:23.810
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

2:07:23.910 --> 2:07:25.810
Hi, how's everything?

2:07:25.910 --> 2:07:27.810
<i>Everything is okay, sir.</i>

2:07:27.910 --> 2:07:31.580
<i>Mrs. Rachel told me.
I am very sorry, sir.</i>

2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:33.610
<i>How's Mrs. Susan?</i>

2:07:33.720 --> 2:07:37.350
She's better now.
They're going to have to operate, but...

2:07:37.860 --> 2:07:40.550
Look, Rachel's flying in tonight.

2:07:40.690 --> 2:07:44.250
She's gonna find someone to
take care of the kids so you can go.

2:07:45.600 --> 2:07:48.760
<i>Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I really appreciate it.</i>

2:07:51.340 --> 2:07:54.070
So, look after them, okay?
Don't tell them anything.

2:07:54.170 --> 2:07:56.610
<i>No, no, no. Don't worry, sir.
Don't worry.</i>

2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:57.830
Okay.

2:07:58.380 --> 2:08:00.540
Put Mike on, please.

2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:03.610
<i>Mike? Your dad is calling.</i>

2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:11.120
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?</i>

2:08:11.230 --> 2:08:15.250
<i>Good. Dad, guess what? Today
they brought hermit crabs to class.</i>

2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:16.450
Oh, really?

2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:22.030
<i>I held one in my hands. It bit me.
It really didn't bleed, but...</i>

2:08:23.240 --> 2:08:25.210
<i>Dad? Are you okay?</i>

2:08:26.840 --> 2:08:28.970
I'm okay. Everything's fine.

2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:31.940
<i>Mariana wanted to take one home.
But the teacher didn't let her. She was...</i>

2:08:32.210 --> 2:08:35.050
<i>I felt sad for her 'cause
she went to the principal's office.</i>

2:08:35.150 --> 2:08:37.980
<i>You know what she did?
She started crying.</i>

2:08:38.090 --> 2:08:41.390
<i>She was really crying.
And the teacher had to send her</i>

2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:45.820
<i>to the principal's office
'cause she was really crying.</i>

2:09:08.180 --> 2:09:13.420
Mr. Wataya, this officer
has been looking for you.

2:09:17.060 --> 2:09:21.460
Good evening, I'm Lieutenant Mamiya.

2:09:22.470 --> 2:09:24.660
Good evening, how can I help you?

2:09:27.300 --> 2:09:30.140
Sir, there was an incident and...

2:09:31.340 --> 2:09:33.240
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

2:09:33.410 --> 2:09:37.070
do you own a .270 caliber
Winchester M70 rifle?

2:09:38.450 --> 2:09:40.250
Registration number...

2:09:42.790 --> 2:09:45.190
UK-9023.

2:09:45.990 --> 2:09:49.480
I don't remember the number,
but I did have a rifle like that.

2:09:50.290 --> 2:09:53.130
Is it true that you gave that rifle
to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim...

2:09:53.260 --> 2:09:54.890
who lives in Morocco?

2:09:55.200 --> 2:09:56.220
Hassan Ibrahim?

2:09:58.140 --> 2:10:00.800
He says he was
your guide in a hunt.

2:10:01.070 --> 2:10:03.100
Hassan? Yes,
I remember him well.

2:10:03.210 --> 2:10:08.870
He was a good guide and a very
good man, I gave him the rifle in thanks.

2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:12.550
Did anything happen?

2:10:13.750 --> 2:10:16.950
That rifle was used
in an attempted murder...

2:10:17.060 --> 2:10:21.120
and the Moroccan police want
to confirm it's not off the black market.

2:10:21.230 --> 2:10:23.790
No, I gave it to him.

2:10:25.660 --> 2:10:28.160
Is Hassan OK?

2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:31.430
I don't know about that.

2:10:35.910 --> 2:10:38.070
Am I legally involved?

2:10:38.440 --> 2:10:43.540
Not for the moment, but can you
come down to the station tomorrow?

2:10:43.780 --> 2:10:45.410
I have a few questions.

2:10:47.620 --> 2:10:48.640
Can I leave now?

2:10:49.920 --> 2:10:51.410
Good night.

2:10:55.600 --> 2:10:56.720
Excuse me.

2:10:58.730 --> 2:11:03.640
I heard from your daughter...
about your wife on the balcony.

2:11:04.810 --> 2:11:06.170
I'm very sorry.

2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:08.410
What balcony?

2:11:10.310 --> 2:11:14.250
About how your wife killed herself
by jumping off the balcony.

2:11:22.190 --> 2:11:26.790
My wife never jumped off a balcony.
She shot herself in the head.

2:11:26.900 --> 2:11:29.090
My daughter was the first to find her.

2:11:31.130 --> 2:11:33.790
I've explained it
to the police many times.

2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:38.110
Don't bother us with that anymore.

2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:41.870
I'm very sorry sir, we won't
bother you anymore.

2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:43.470
Good night.

2:12:36.070 --> 2:12:37.660
Another shochu.

2:13:15.970 --> 2:13:19.030
<i>Susan Jones, who was wounded

2:13:19.140 --> 2:13:23.080
