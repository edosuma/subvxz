WEBVTT

00:44.920 --> 00:46.379
Sounds like the place.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.673
I couldn't believe there were
two parties on this block.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.091
I have no problem with Negroes.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.468
I'm just worried about the car.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.929
We can still go home.
This was your idea.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.098
It's important that
we're here, for you.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.599
For the people that work for you.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.017
Lovely, go easy on that.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.519
Some of them don't feel that way.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.937
Is my nose running?

01:26.211 --> 01:28.296
- How are you?
- Hi.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.672
Sorry about that, buddy.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.340
What did you do with your coats?

01:31.425 --> 01:33.134
We left them in the car.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.387
When we called to get directions
from somewhere else in New Jersey,

01:36.472 --> 01:38.222
Paul gave Harry the idea.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.016
I took my purse.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.727
I can smell alcohol, but I don't see it.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.103
It's him.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.855
It's a party.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.398
Cosgrove's doing great.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.734
Let's go get a drink.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.402
I'm going to stay here.

01:51.487 --> 01:52.987
Come with me.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.371
So you work for these stuffed shirts?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.664
I work with them.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.958
Peggy. Glad to see a familiar face.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.251
Yes. How are you?

02:07.336 --> 02:08.711
Introduce us to your friend.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.004
Eugene, whom I just met,

02:10.130 --> 02:11.547
was telling me that at Princeton

02:11.632 --> 02:13.966
Paul used to dress up like a girl.

02:14.051 --> 02:17.428
According to him,
that's the way Shakespeare did it.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.764
Looking stunning, as always.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.934
Much too good for him.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.602
What are you doing out here?

02:24.686 --> 02:26.729
Not enough subterraneans
in the Village?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.440
I'm here because this isn't
Greenwich Village.

02:29.525 --> 02:30.900
This is America.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.276
How do you get to the city?

02:32.361 --> 02:35.112
The number 33 bus takes you
right to Port Authority.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.281
Trust me, MontcIair is the knees.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.909
We have Globe Trotter Antiques.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.452
We have the Wellmont Theater.

02:41.537 --> 02:44.247
Silent movies with organ.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.581
The Montclair Art Gallery.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.708
George Inness. Have you heard of him?

02:47.793 --> 02:48.918
Of course I have.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.628
Come.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.129
Enjoy.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.756
Imbibe.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.807
You're a button, you know that?

03:02.891 --> 03:04.976
And you're drunk.

03:06.395 --> 03:10.022
Can't get Donna here on my desk
because she keeps refusing.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.149
You're not allowed to do that.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.485
I can't feel my cheeks.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.153
I can.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.613
I feel them fine.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.824
My mother says when you
can't feel your cheeks,

03:19.908 --> 03:22.368
it's time to stop.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.705
Well, what do I do with this?

03:26.748 --> 03:28.583
There. That works.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.459
Oh, my God.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.254
Don't you and Kitty
have some place to be?

03:37.968 --> 03:39.510
Apparently, when they say "on call,"

03:39.595 --> 03:41.012
it does not mean "aνailable by phone."

03:41.096 --> 03:42.513
You have to be in the hospital.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.265
I'm sorry he didn't make it.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.766
I'm looking forward to meeting him.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.686
I've been having this pain right here.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.854
You've met him.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.522
How could I forget?

03:51.607 --> 03:54.734
Big, handsome, saνes people's lives.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.821
Why did you get the nice glass?

03:58.906 --> 04:02.366
Because l haνe the Rhone Gallagher.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.702
Fine. What is it?

04:04.786 --> 04:07.788
There's a ship that went down in 1 871 ,

04:07.873 --> 04:10.041
and the casks of Rhone were on it.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.584
It was a very good year.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.336
And it sank,

04:13.420 --> 04:16.339
and they washed up
on shore two years ago,

04:16.423 --> 04:18.674
and they sold 1 80 bottles,

04:18.759 --> 04:20.635
and I haνe one.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.386
But not a sofa.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.098
Joan, l want you to meet someone.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.808
My baby-- Sheila.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.268
Sheila White.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.063
Joan is our senior secretary.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.439
Office manager.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.982
Sheila's an assistant manager.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.026
At the Food Fair in South Orange.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.235
She's saving for school.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.780
- Kinsey!
- What?

04:40.864 --> 04:42.907
The man upstairs is here.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.283
God?

04:44.368 --> 04:47.328
No. lt's Mr. Hoffenberg.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.330
He wants to talk to you.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.499
He smells marijuana.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.128
Don't talk until l get back.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.964
I'm serious.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.510
I don't think we have
a Food Fair in Manhattan.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.428
Is it a big market with a parking lot?

05:04.513 --> 05:05.763
It is.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.056
Well, one day you'll drive in

05:07.140 --> 05:08.599
in a station wagon
and be a customer.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.476
I grew up out here.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.769
I've already been a customer.

05:13.605 --> 05:17.024
It's fun to meet the boys,
put faces with names.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.026
Well, it's good to see
you and Paul together.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.696
I have to say, when Paul
and I were together,

05:21.780 --> 05:24.824
the last thing I would have
taken him for was open-minded.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.327
I loνe your purse.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.123
Thanks. I just got it.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.337
What's that?

05:40.173 --> 05:42.633
Marjorie. Works at the newsstand.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.135
I like.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.012
But behind her.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.140
You stole that.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.933
That's from the office.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.727
That dumb girl almost got fired.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.562
But she didn't.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.857
I'm a writer. I need it.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.869
Hey, Brooklyn, come home with me.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.332
Why not? I live alone.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.251
Why should I?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.296
Because I like you,
and we're having a good time,

06:20.380 --> 06:22.173
and l'm a good kisser,

06:22.257 --> 06:24.633
and you know you want to.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.510
Eugene.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.430
I'm in the persuasion business,

06:29.514 --> 06:32.933
and frankly, I'm disappointed
by your presentation.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.151
Come on.

07:19.022 --> 07:22.233
Fifth Avenue's a parking lot,
in both directions.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.693
Traffic makes the parade look bigger.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.237
What parade?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.905
Colonel Glenn.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.618
It's incredible what passes
for heroism these days.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.745
l'd like ticker tape
for pulling out of my driveway

07:34.830 --> 07:36.580
and going around the block three times.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.125
It's not like people were shooting at him.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.584
I think he's a winner.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.254
Square jaw, false modesty.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.464
Looks like he just took off
his letterman jacket.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.134
You going to go down there
with your autograph book at lunch?

08:00.021 --> 08:02.398
Can I just fire everyone?

08:03.900 --> 08:10.823
Excuse me!

08:10.907 --> 08:12.867
This is a place of business.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.786
Colonel Glenn will be on Earth
for the rest of his life.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.329
Plane went down.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.290
American Airlines
Flight 1 to Los Angeles.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.542
Crashed in Jamaica Bay.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.420
...had suddenly become locked
in a death dive into the bay--

08:24.504 --> 08:26.589
There could be
a hundred people on there.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.048
Just fell out of the sky.

08:28.133 --> 08:32.136
...turn prescribed
by Idlewild Airport rules.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.848
The Federal Aviation Agency
said there is no rational basis

08:35.932 --> 08:40.186
for grounding the Boeing 707
as a result of the crash.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.439
Federal Aνiation
administrator Najeeb Halaby

08:43.523 --> 08:45.065
- summarizing--
- Turn it off.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.401
...of the inνestigation
said there was no--

08:48.987 --> 08:50.279
Pull all Mohawk ROP.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.906
And anything in production, stop it.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.741
But it wasn't a Mohawk plane.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.451
We don't want people
opening their morning paper

08:55.535 --> 08:58.120
and seeing a Mohawk ad
next to a picture of a floating engine.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.165
The rest of you, stop crying

09:01.249 --> 09:03.459
and figure out how we're going
to hit the ground running

09:03.543 --> 09:05.586
in three weeks with new work.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.837
Excuse me.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.672
Well, for one thing,

09:08.757 --> 09:11.884
we should probably avoid
the term "hit the ground."

09:12.802 --> 09:15.721
How about "Idlewild to Rockaway
in less than eight minutes"?

09:19.601 --> 09:21.268
Answer the phone, sweetheart.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.023
- Some of the passengers--
- Sterling Cooper.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.942
...were on their way
to a golf tournament.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.069
Apparently, the minute the plane hit,

09:30.153 --> 09:31.445
the bay turned plaid.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.783
Get back to work.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.204
Jets are made for dropping
bombs on Moscow,

09:40.288 --> 09:41.622
not French cuisine.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.877
Although I like those
little girls they have.

09:46.962 --> 09:50.005
You know, they're completely captive.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.300
Mr. Phillips to see you.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.345
Send him in.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.895
Someone should tell Draper
to pull everything from Mohawk.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.189
He knows that.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.859
I just had an interesting conversation
with Shel Keneally.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.528
He's inside of American Airlines.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.988
Is the plane still crashed?

10:15.782 --> 10:18.409
Shel was a client
when I was at Y&R in London.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.160
We had some times together.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.581
It's complete chaos oνer there.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.500
They have any idea what went wrong?

10:26.626 --> 10:27.751
None.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.587
Normal takeoff, perfect weather.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.256
The thing just nose-dived, exploded.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.882
That's not comforting.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.511
Shel says they're going to
need to make a fresh start.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.054
Did he say "fresh start"?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.056
A few times.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.769
That is an interesting phone call.

10:50.859 --> 10:54.236
Yes.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.116
I can't talk right now.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.741
Mr. Campbell, are you all right?

11:43.912 --> 11:45.162
Mr. Campbell?

11:50.251 --> 11:52.169
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.213
What's going on?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.717
I just got off the phone with my brother.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.304
It's the strangest thing.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.015
ApparentIy, my father
was on that plane.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.603
What?

12:10.855 --> 12:14.066
My father, he was on the plane.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.243
God, I'm sorry to hear that.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.791
I don't know what to do.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.713
I just saw him at the barber.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.258
Paul Molé on Lex.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.391
What does one do?

12:49.310 --> 12:51.311
Make arrangements, I guess.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.857
What am I supposed to do?

12:56.860 --> 12:58.610
What people do.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.945
Go home.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.909
I don't even think
I know how old he was.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.661
Someone's going to ask that.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.582
I don't know. I suppose.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.958
You know what?

13:13.042 --> 13:15.169
I don't think I'm going to tell anyone.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.839
Am I going to cry?

13:21.843 --> 13:22.968
You just had a shock.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.928
I wouldn't...

13:25.013 --> 13:28.098
worry about what you're feeling.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.434
Go home and be with your family.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.519
Why?

13:32.604 --> 13:35.063
Because that's what people do.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.773
Is that what you would do?

13:36.858 --> 13:39.026
Yes.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.614
Really?

13:43.698 --> 13:45.949
Yes.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.874
Everything's exactly the same.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.253
You should go home.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.553
What about the Stouffer's meeting?

14:06.638 --> 14:08.847
I'll cancel it.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.349
It's not hurting anything.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.689
There's life, and there's work.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.411
Hey, I got one.

14:31.496 --> 14:32.663
"Mohawk Airlines--

14:32.747 --> 14:35.332
when you need to make it
past Jamaica Bay."

14:35.416 --> 14:38.252
How about "American--
pioneering vertical flight"?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.257
Mr. Draper, Mr. Cooper
would like to see you.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.184
I spoke with Hank Lamont
oνer at Mohawk.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.019
How are they doing over there?

14:56.104 --> 14:57.854
He says they can weather it out.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.022
I always get the feeling

14:59.107 --> 15:01.191
that man opens his front door
and money comes in.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.693
Always cleaned me out.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.152
Best poker player in the South Pacific.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.655
Duck, tell Don here
about your phone call.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.866
Well, I put in a call to check in
with Shel Keneally

15:09.951 --> 15:11.535
over at American Airlines.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.704
He used to run lnternational.
We're oId pals.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.205
He picked up the phone?

15:15.290 --> 15:16.498
What's going on over there?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.958
Shel says it's bedlam.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.710
Anyway, he was
quite clear about the fact

15:19.794 --> 15:21.378
that they're going
to want to make changes

15:21.462 --> 15:23.505
if they want the dust to settle fast.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.881
What does that mean?

15:24.966 --> 15:29.052
It means they'll be looking
for a new image

15:29.137 --> 15:31.972
and thus a new agency.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.768
What's it been, four, three hours

15:36.853 --> 15:38.395
since the plane went down?

15:38.479 --> 15:39.813
You'll have to forgive me

15:39.939 --> 15:42.149
for not looking at a bunch
of bodies in Jamaica Bay

15:42.233 --> 15:43.400
and seeing the opportunity.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.152
Adding a few hours or a day or a week

15:45.236 --> 15:46.570
doesn't make this any more
of an opportunity.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.697
- We already haνe an airline.
- We don't have American.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.449
That's right, we have
the one whose planes

15:50.533 --> 15:52.367
didn't just fall out of the sky.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.869
That's good.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.454
I'm sorry. ls there an issue?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.914
$1 million. $7 million.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.082
Am I missing something?

15:59.167 --> 16:00.709
Did you sign American
during this phone call?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.169
No, but Shel made it very clear

16:02.253 --> 16:05.213
that if we can get rid of our conflict,
he'd love to hear our ideas.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.423
It's a serious foothold.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.967
A foothold.
I'd do anything for a foothold.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.927
This is how it works.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.930
We got a regional airline
so we'd haνe a shot at a big one.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.766
I know how you had it in your head.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.934
The President of American Airlines
sees a Mohawk ad,

16:18.019 --> 16:20.395
falls in love, and says
"Get me that guy."

16:20.480 --> 16:23.106
I'm sorry it didn't play out that way.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.858
Easy.

16:29.072 --> 16:33.450
We have a good client who trusts us,
who likes our work,

16:33.534 --> 16:36.244
who pays their bills on time.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.163
They don't deserve
to be thrown out the door

16:38.247 --> 16:39.915
for a wink from American.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.209
I can't belieνe this.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.879
Anything else?

16:55.556 --> 16:57.057
He'll be fine.

17:02.397 --> 17:05.982
l'll need to cancel
my reservations to Sarasota

17:06.067 --> 17:09.069
and, of course, Andrew's return flight.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.782
But I-- Well, they can't possibly expect--

17:13.866 --> 17:15.117
I'm sure that's taken care of.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.785
Dunham's taking care of all that.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.578
Bud's on the phone
with him right now.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.831
I'm sure he'll forget something.

17:21.916 --> 17:25.460
There's no way that he
can remember eνerything.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.838
Bud's very good with things like this.

17:27.922 --> 17:31.758
Is he aware there is no way
to have a funeral without the remains?

17:31.843 --> 17:33.260
What's the difference?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.723
You're right.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.850
There's just so much to do.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.436
What is that?

17:43.938 --> 17:45.147
What?

17:45.231 --> 17:48.692
That.

17:51.654 --> 17:52.863
What is that?

17:54.615 --> 17:55.866
Take it.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.409
I want you to have it.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.540
He was such a fine man,

18:03.624 --> 18:06.251
so well-mannered, civic.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.044
My father admired him.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.088
What a nice thing to say.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.301
I like to offer a nice
bouquet of thoughts.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.104
Did you take care of everything?

18:26.189 --> 18:27.856
They do this all the time.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.109
- What?
- I took care of it.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.238
Give me another one
of those, a big one.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.658
Dunham had
some unpleasant news.

18:38.743 --> 18:42.078
Dad was insolvent, broke.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.080
Is there enough for a funeral?

18:44.165 --> 18:47.709
As if the idea of a will
never crossed your mind?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.419
We weren't going to get that.

18:49.504 --> 18:50.921
You weren't.

18:52.757 --> 18:53.965
What about her money?

18:55.343 --> 18:57.427
The Dykeman Trust isn't
as solid as one would hope.

18:57.512 --> 18:59.554
A lot of loans were taken
out by the president--

18:59.639 --> 19:01.598
and recipient-- Daddy.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.226
Really? For what?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.188
I asked Dunham
if there was a woman.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.106
He said no.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.651
lt's all oysters, travel,
and club memberships.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.362
Does she know?

19:15.446 --> 19:18.281
You want to tell her? Go ahead.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.664
Everything's been taken care of.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.208
Boys.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.924
Father called you salt and pepper.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.179
That's beautiful, Dot.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.728
Hi, Daddy.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.734
I made you a ham sandwich.

19:54.819 --> 19:55.986
What is this?

19:56.070 --> 19:58.154
Carlton and Francine are
coming over for cards.

19:58.239 --> 20:01.533
Oh, Bets. Didn't we just do that?

20:04.662 --> 20:07.289
We haven't done it
since before Christmas.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.249
And they keep inviting us,
and we never go.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.252
- Can I play cards?
- l want to play.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.255
I'm going to lie down for a minute.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.965
I have the chenille bedspread on.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.967
Pull it back or they'll see
the marks on your face

20:19.051 --> 20:21.219
and know you were sleeping.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.306
You can say hello to everyone,
then it's off to bed.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.356
Muddled. That means smash it.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.651
He'll be nicer on the second one.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.486
You did a wonderful job on mine.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.654
Thank you.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.115
Go take Mommy and Francine's orders.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.201
Bobby, that is your last one.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.412
All right. Come on, go.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.122
Watch TV.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.542
They're growing like weeds.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.544
That's true.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.172
We have the Caruthers girl
over to baby-sit already.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.341
Can you believe that?

20:59.425 --> 21:00.842
I don't think we know her.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.552
You'd remember.

21:02.637 --> 21:03.929
Goes to lmmaculate Heart.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.973
I've been out
of high school a long time,

21:07.058 --> 21:09.309
but honestly, the way these girls dress,

21:09.393 --> 21:11.019
and those uniforms.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.731
Carlton.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.691
What?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.735
I'm enjoying this story so far,

21:18.819 --> 21:21.321
but I have a feeling
it's not going to end well.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.325
I think that Francine
brings her in to torture me.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.703
l mean, everything I do
rubs her the wrong way.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.664
I got rid of the apartment in the city.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.375
I'm taking her to Nassau.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.127
There was a pie
cooling in the windowsill,

21:36.212 --> 21:38.588
and I'm not eνen
supposed to smell it?

21:39.674 --> 21:41.257
It's Darkness at Noon.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.259
- What do you want to hear?
- Now, come on.

21:43.344 --> 21:45.178
Don't be like that.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.764
Two Tom Collins.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.266
Okay, you don't smash
the cherry on that.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.810
Just plop it in at the end.

21:51.894 --> 21:54.020
Try to keep it in the top of the glass.

21:54.105 --> 21:55.647
Gin.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.542
Oil issues showed
some signs of life today

22:15.626 --> 22:17.252
when the Department of the Treasury

22:17.336 --> 22:20.630
announced plans to ease
import quotas on residual oil.

22:20.715 --> 22:24.592
By the end of the day,
Texaco added 1/4, ShelI...

22:24.677 --> 22:26.261
Oh, good, you didn't wait.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.846
We couldn't. It's late.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.098
Work.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.558
Your hair looks nice.

22:31.642 --> 22:32.726
It does,

22:32.810 --> 22:35.228
and she fought with Mr. Pierre
every minute of it.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.983
He's got some funny ideas.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.568
You want something to eat?

22:41.652 --> 22:43.570
No, thank you. l already ate.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.241
Connie Griffin was in her yard,

22:48.367 --> 22:49.659
hanging laundry in Bergen Beach.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.619
She saw the whole thing.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.163
Can you imagine?

22:53.247 --> 22:55.749
WOR said there were
sharks eating the victims.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.834
That's worth reporting.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.377
You want toast?

22:59.462 --> 23:01.004
Mama, I already ate.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.256
You say you're coming to dinner,
and you already ate?

23:04.925 --> 23:06.885
I came because I wanted to see you.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.470
We never see you.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.516
I'm here. Right now.

23:14.602 --> 23:15.935
Such a pretty face.

23:19.023 --> 23:23.777
Gladys Rhine was asking for you at church.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.945
Babe saw your brassiere ads
in the newspaper.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.532
You should see poor Donny.
His skin is horrible.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.242
Clearasil.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.286
- He's beyond that.
- It's a shame.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.954
He's a handsome boy.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.167
Lots of people was
asking me about you.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.838
Doesn't mean the same thing
to me that it means to you.

23:45.299 --> 23:48.426
I think your father would like it
if you lit a candle for him.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.643
I pray for you.

24:02.900 --> 24:06.736
You know she lies and tells people
you're out of town on business.

24:06.821 --> 24:09.489
She has some made-up church
in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,

24:09.573 --> 24:11.282
where you go to mass with a friend of hers.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.576
No one asked her to lie.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.454
She's not going to be here forever.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.251
Would it kill you to go?

24:22.503 --> 24:24.170
I don't want to.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.589
And I'm capable of making
my own decisions.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.259
Really? State of New York
didn't think so.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.177
The doctors didn't think so.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.306
Did you bring the vacuum?

24:35.391 --> 24:36.724
Yes.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.602
Did you empty the bag?

24:39.687 --> 24:41.104
Yes.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.279
How do you let her get away
with making a bid of 1 50?

24:49.363 --> 24:51.948
She usually overbids.
How was I supposed to know?

24:52.032 --> 24:54.659
I do not overbid. I'm cautious.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.745
I hear it's going to be
a row of apartments

24:57.830 --> 24:59.414
all up Cedar Lane.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.791
No more cedars.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.211
No parking around the school.

25:05.296 --> 25:08.590
You know, I could've had
that property for a song?

25:08.674 --> 25:09.883
A song and a half, tops.

25:09.967 --> 25:13.052
I thought he was crazy,
but there you go.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.560
I'm sure we haνe
something else to talk about.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.315
Did you hear about that jetliner?

25:25.399 --> 25:27.901
Terrible. It's terrible.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.777
I was supposed to fly to Cleveland.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.488
Now I can't. I have to take the train.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.824
Nine hours.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.160
You have got to be kidding.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.745
Sorry.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.875
I love the train. You do, too.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.337
Bobby.

25:48.589 --> 25:49.797
Go back to bed.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.676
I'm scared. I heard something.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.179
Everything's great. Go back to bed.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.683
Bobby.

26:03.687 --> 26:04.896
Come on.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.231
Do what your mother says.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.027
When l was a child,

26:11.111 --> 26:12.695
I would've been way more
afraid of my father

26:12.780 --> 26:14.030
than of going to sleep.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.199
I hated going to sleep
when I was a kid.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.785
But I bet you did when you were told.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.536
With a stack of comics and a flashlight.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.997
I don't care what they do
when they're up there.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.208
I just like a few hours of quiet.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.252
Ernie tests my patience.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.132
Said he saw a ghost.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.552
He was scared.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.638
He's a little liar.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.557
He is?

26:41.642 --> 26:45.728
He drew the most amazing picture
of George Washington the other day.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.272
His teacher was so impressed,

26:47.356 --> 26:49.190
she put it up in the hallway.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.192
It really looked like him.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.069
Well, obviously.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.445
Because he brought it home,

26:54.530 --> 26:56.906
and l noticed the exact same
image of Washington

26:56.991 --> 26:59.284
on the cover of one of his books.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.702
He had traced it.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.161
What happened?

27:02.246 --> 27:04.539
He brought a book to school
so he could trace it?

27:04.623 --> 27:07.417
Well, I don't know.
Maybe they had it there.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.210
I mean, the point is it was dishonest.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.880
My whole art department
is run on tracing paper.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.340
Why reinνent the wheel?

27:15.843 --> 27:17.218
I've got the rest.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.140
I don't care about tracing.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.058
What about all
that praise he accepted

27:24.143 --> 27:26.436
for something he didn't do?

27:26.520 --> 27:29.105
Well, the book says they
start fibbing at this age.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.941
They want to see if they
can make it come true.

27:32.026 --> 27:34.360
I don't need a book
to know what little boys do.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.201
You have anything you want me
to take back to the library?

27:42.286 --> 27:43.703
Anything you want me to pick up?

27:43.787 --> 27:48.458
No. I have to renew
The Agony and the Ecstasy.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.001
It's taking forever.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.295
I should go. I have to work tomorrow.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.921
Busy bee.

27:56.050 --> 27:57.717
Aren't you going to say good night?

28:23.118 --> 28:24.577
Hi, Aunt Peggy.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.342
Marilyn says Helen Bishop's
trying to stop them

28:39.426 --> 28:42.011
from putting parking meters
at Depot PIaza.

28:42.096 --> 28:45.181
Apparently, she got chummy
with some administrator at the high school.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.724
Big, fat fellow.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.269
Carlton's put on a few.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.855
I think it's nice he's filled out.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.315
It shows he's happy.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.859
I wouldn't say that.

28:58.654 --> 29:00.738
Why not?

29:00.823 --> 29:02.532
Did he say something?
What did he say?

29:02.616 --> 29:04.367
He didn't say anything.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.371
Well, he should be happy.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.831
Okay, maybe he is.

29:09.915 --> 29:13.334
He should be happy and grateful
and showering Francine with loνe

29:13.419 --> 29:14.710
after what he put her through.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.797
Look, Bets, I'm not going to fight.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.885
I'll say whatever
you think l should say,

29:22.970 --> 29:25.179
but l'm not going to fight with you.

30:18.108 --> 30:19.942
What, sweetheart?

30:20.027 --> 30:22.445
You laughed. What's funny?

30:23.864 --> 30:24.906
I just--

30:26.241 --> 30:29.952
I was just thinking that the last
conversation l had with him,

30:30.037 --> 30:32.538
we were arguing about
whether Barney Kellogg

30:32.623 --> 30:37.293
bred Boston terriers
or French bulldogs.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.836
I'm sorry you were arguing.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.216
Those ugly little pushed-in faces.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.176
The labored breathing.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.138
He said they were French bulldogs.

30:49.223 --> 30:51.891
I said they were Boston terriers.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.810
He was angry about it.

30:54.895 --> 30:58.731
Oh, Peter, neither of you
knew it was the last time.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.027
Fighting about facts, my mother calls it.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.987
We do it all the time.

31:05.072 --> 31:08.908
Argue over something
that's actually one thing or another.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.287
What do Barney's dogs look like?

31:13.372 --> 31:14.622
Just beige.

31:14.706 --> 31:18.960
Kind of like pugs, but with big ears.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.378
Those are French bulldogs.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.922
Really?

31:30.430 --> 31:32.890
When l woke up, I felt fine for a minute.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.436
Then I remembered.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.440
You should be thinking
about the good times.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.610
Right.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.197
So they go out a third time,

31:48.282 --> 31:50.741
and now the restaurant's
eνen worse-- Indian food.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.618
But she really likes him.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.954
l told you he worked
for City Hall, for the Mayor.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.290
- So what happened?
- I need three copies.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.042
One goes to Mr. Robinson,
one to Mr. Fairbanks,

32:00.127 --> 32:01.419
and one to Mr. Smith.

32:01.503 --> 32:02.670
The strange one.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.255
That doesn't narrow it down.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.299
Thank you.

32:06.383 --> 32:07.717
Mr. Kinsey.

32:07.801 --> 32:09.510
Is something wrong?

32:12.139 --> 32:13.723
I'm aνoiding you.

32:13.807 --> 32:16.225
Or haven't you noticed that
after three days?

32:16.310 --> 32:17.810
Are you worried
about the typewriter?

32:17.936 --> 32:19.312
I'm not going to tell anyone.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.397
Although you were so brazen,

32:21.481 --> 32:23.316
you don't deserve clemency.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.069
What did you say to Sheila?

32:27.154 --> 32:29.405
- Who?
- Sheila.

32:29.489 --> 32:30.781
My girlfriend.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.617
Describe her to me.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.243
Very funny.

32:34.328 --> 32:36.495
I know what's first on the list.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.374
Oh, my God, l knew
you were a lot of things--

32:40.459 --> 32:42.043
I'm not a phony.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.419
You're so proud.

32:43.503 --> 32:46.047
It's so obvious why you're seeing her.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.424
A supermarket checkout girl?

32:48.508 --> 32:50.760
Conversation must be stimulating.

32:50.844 --> 32:52.178
Lettuce costs a nickel.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.597
What a relief. You're just jealous.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.641
Because you're the one who got away?

32:56.725 --> 33:00.811
You, out there in your
poor-little-rich-boy apartment

33:00.896 --> 33:03.189
in Newark or whereνer.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.609
Walking around with your pipe
and your beard,

33:06.693 --> 33:07.985
falling in love with that girl

33:08.070 --> 33:10.488
just to show how interesting you are.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.867
Go ahead. What part is wrong?

33:31.635 --> 33:33.469
Pete?

33:33.553 --> 33:35.888
Duck. Come in.

33:37.057 --> 33:39.725
Where's the girl?

33:39.810 --> 33:42.269
She's supposed to tell me
if she goes anywhere.

33:46.316 --> 33:49.568
When my old man died,
I went on a hell of a bender.

33:51.405 --> 33:52.697
You heard about that.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.907
I had to read about it
in the Times.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.410
l wish you felt that you
could talk to me about it.

33:57.494 --> 34:00.079
You should be able to.
We're practically family here.

34:02.833 --> 34:05.042
I don't know, Duck.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.503
There's not a lot to say.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.547
No. Of course not.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.469
Your old man was in advertising, right?

34:15.554 --> 34:16.721
Boston.

34:16.805 --> 34:19.557
Used to talk about the '20s
like we're idiots.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.893
My father wasn't.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.353
Of course, it turns out

34:24.438 --> 34:26.188
I really didn't know
anything about him

34:26.273 --> 34:28.649
except that he did not
like advertising.

34:28.734 --> 34:32.027
Ah, that's his style.
I'm sure he was proud of you.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.321
Some people have trouble saying it.

34:35.490 --> 34:38.409
Yes. That was a problem for him.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.619
What's not to be proud of?

34:40.704 --> 34:42.455
You pay attention. You're hungry.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.373
Most of the time you know
what you're doing.

34:44.458 --> 34:45.666
I've noticed that.

34:47.711 --> 34:49.795
I appreciate that.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.718
Now, l don't want you to think
I'm being insensitive,

34:55.802 --> 34:58.220
but we're going after American Airlines.

35:01.391 --> 35:02.641
Well, it's--

35:02.726 --> 35:04.518
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.562
Okay.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.399
I'm meeting at the University Club
with Shel Keneally.

35:10.484 --> 35:13.027
Tonight, actually.
Get everything rolling.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.488
If anything, l'd like you on board.

35:15.572 --> 35:18.115
l want you leading
the way on this thing.

35:21.828 --> 35:24.288
I think I am uncomfortable.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.376
I don't think I should do that.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.712
It just happened.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.345
I haven't even cried yet.

35:41.223 --> 35:42.515
Of course.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.518
It was inappropriate.

35:53.193 --> 35:54.985
I'm sorry for your loss.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.382
Can you come in here
with the papers I asked for?

36:23.056 --> 36:24.306
Sweetheart.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.267
You mind?

36:30.397 --> 36:31.939
I need you to set a meeting.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.649
A quiet place, but pubIic.

36:35.235 --> 36:37.361
Have a heart-to-heart
with Henry Lamont.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.487
Why would l do that?

36:38.572 --> 36:40.406
Because we're cutting him loose.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.908
Duck's having a meeting
with Shel Keneally

36:42.993 --> 36:44.159
from American Airlines tonight.

36:44.244 --> 36:46.495
He's letting them know
that Mohawk is over.

36:46.580 --> 36:47.830
And that gets us a pitch?

36:49.082 --> 36:51.208
It sends a signal that we're serious.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.168
And that we're willing
to do whatever it takes.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.796
He has nothing.
And this is more of it.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.214
- It's desperate.
- Come on.

36:57.299 --> 36:59.717
You should be salivating to
rip these guys away from DDB.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.136
And even if we don't
win this account,

37:02.220 --> 37:04.388
we're going to be on a list
in the New York Times

37:04.472 --> 37:05.806
of big boys pitching for this business.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.641
We have an airline.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.727
What kind of company
are we going to be?

37:11.104 --> 37:13.355
The kind where everyone
has a summer house?

37:15.692 --> 37:17.401
I can't belieνe I look like an idiot

37:17.485 --> 37:18.694
for wanting to be loyal
to these people.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.029
Take off your dress.

37:20.113 --> 37:22.656
You get a chance
at American Airlines, you take it.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.617
End of discussion.

37:43.637 --> 37:45.471
Hildy, can you get my wife on the phone?

37:45.555 --> 37:46.889
Of course.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.808
Forget it.

38:08.078 --> 38:09.411
Mr. Campbell.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.622
Don. Do you haνe a minute?

38:11.706 --> 38:14.124
What do you want, Campbell?

38:15.460 --> 38:17.711
I just was-- l don't know.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.339
It's not a good time.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.889
If you want, you can
leave him a note.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.724
People do that.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.017
No.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.687
Thank you.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.250
Good night, Joan.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.184
Did you see who did this?

39:15.520 --> 39:16.729
No.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.107
I never would have guessed
you were in your 30s.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.151
People should not bring
their personal problems

39:22.235 --> 39:23.402
into the office.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.612
I agree.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.823
Is it so hard to just leave
everything at the door

39:27.907 --> 39:28.949
and just do your job?

39:30.618 --> 39:32.327
I look forward to it.

39:32.412 --> 39:34.621
They can't stand it.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.458
They'll drag you into
the garbage out there.

39:37.542 --> 39:41.045
They just want you to be
as miserable as they are.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.672
I say let them have it.

40:02.275 --> 40:04.318
Thanks.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.487
How are you, Don?

40:07.489 --> 40:08.739
Henry.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.074
Sit down.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.367
Can I get you anything?

40:12.452 --> 40:15.245
You know, I'm glad you picked this place.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.414
It reminds me of Pearl Harbor.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.709
For many reasons.

40:24.297 --> 40:26.924
Do you think you're not
going to haνe to say it?

40:29.511 --> 40:30.886
Sterling Cooper has decided

40:30.970 --> 40:33.388
to end its relationship
with Mohawk Airlines.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.516
Sterling Cooper.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.185
I'm sorry.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.020
It wasn't my decision.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.856
You know, when we came in there,

40:42.941 --> 40:45.109
they all said Sterling Cooper
is Don Draper.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.693
That's what you get.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.866
That talk you gave me
about us growing together.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.911
You said Sterling Cooper
didn't need a big airline.

40:55.995 --> 40:59.123
You were going
to make us a big airline.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.879
I wish things hadn't
worked out this way.

41:09.342 --> 41:12.010
I'm almost embarrassed to say this.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.639
You fooled me.

41:25.733 --> 41:29.945
Stockholders weren't remotely impressed
with firing our head of ops.

41:30.029 --> 41:35.492
So this agency change,
well, that's going to be a process.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.120
And to be part of that process?

41:38.204 --> 41:40.581
- Listen, we're here talking, right?
- Of course.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.457
But it's hard for me
to leave here comfortable

41:42.542 --> 41:43.876
unless I know what
your objections are.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.461
Well, we're a few steps
away from objections.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.255
We're just sticking a toe in the water.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.091
Well, we're not. We jumped in.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.180
Pete.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.391
It's good to see you.

42:00.894 --> 42:03.854
Shel, this is Pete Campbell.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.189
I don't think he's our best.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.815
I think he's the best.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.111
Pleased to meet you.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.529
You as well.

42:15.617 --> 42:18.160
I was just telling my buddy Shel here

42:18.244 --> 42:20.287
how we've really cleared
the way to be in this.

42:21.706 --> 42:26.543
I was telling Duck here
we don't know where we are yet.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.380
I don't think you're aware

42:30.465 --> 42:32.382
of the level of commitment
and enthusiasm

42:32.467 --> 42:33.800
for this project at Sterling Cooper.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.010
It's true.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.511
We've got writers bucking the gate.

42:36.596 --> 42:38.555
I've already got a stack
of ideas on my desk

42:38.640 --> 42:40.057
that I think you'd love to see.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.356
We understand how delicate

42:47.440 --> 42:50.275
the process of rebuilding
the public's confidence will be.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.070
Not just the public. Our stockholders.

42:54.489 --> 42:56.365
Well, I want you to know that,

42:56.449 --> 42:58.533
should you decide
to bring us your business,

42:58.618 --> 43:00.535
there will be someone
on your account

43:00.620 --> 43:02.371
who knows exactly
what you're going through.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.963
My father was on that plane.

43:13.883 --> 43:15.133
My goodness.

43:17.637 --> 43:18.804
Sorry to hear that.

43:18.888 --> 43:21.139
Yes. Well...

43:22.183 --> 43:24.184
it's a horrible thing.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.937
Hopefully, something good
will come of it.

43:28.064 --> 43:30.190
That is something I will pass on.

43:35.321 --> 43:36.863
Shall we grab a bite?

43:36.948 --> 43:38.240
I put our name in.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.870
I'm not your waitress,
but are you all set here?

44:29.334 --> 44:30.417
Excuse me?

44:30.501 --> 44:33.128
You've been sitting alone a long time.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.755
Can I get you a menu?

44:37.675 --> 44:38.925
I don't think so.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.678
I have to drop this off,

44:41.763 --> 44:45.557
but I can swing back
around on my way out.

44:49.771 --> 44:51.355
Not tonight.

46:37.962 --> 46:39.963
Would you hold him for me?

46:40.047 --> 46:41.798
Thanks.
