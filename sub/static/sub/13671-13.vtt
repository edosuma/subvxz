WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.280
Previously,
on St Elsewhere...

00:03.280 --> 00:07.280
You're a lucky man, Fiscus.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.680
We shouldn't
keep seeing each other.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.920
It's three years since I've seen
my husband.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.240
To our new life
together here.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.480
When is my licence approved?

00:16.480 --> 00:18.360
I said you'd get it, didn't I?

00:18.360 --> 00:22.360
Your surgical
licence was denied.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.840
It's Steven Craig.
Mark's son.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.880
How's Steven?  He's dead.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.800
Let's swing.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.800
Too, too good.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.480
Fiscus. Good to see you back.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.000
You look healthy.
Doing all right?

02:25.000 --> 02:25.880
Great.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.560
Great.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.040
If you get a chance,
come up and visit.

02:29.040 --> 02:33.040
I will. I'll make sure
I find you, OK?

02:37.480 --> 02:38.920
Columbia Banks?

02:38.920 --> 02:40.360
I'll take her, Elliot.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.240
Wayne! Hi! Don't you want
to take off your jacket?

02:43.240 --> 02:46.760
Later. I'm psyched
to jump in.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.200
I smell gas.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.640
Don't blame me.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.560
I mean gasoline. Low-lead.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.440
After the jerk
punched me,

02:53.440 --> 02:55.840
he poured premium
over my head.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.240
He chased me around,
flicking his Bic.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.800
Got an unusual sense
of humour, that Jorge.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.960
Any dizziness,
loss of consciousness?

03:02.960 --> 03:06.160
Nah. I just came in
for this sore throat.

03:06.160 --> 03:10.160
Oh, let me take a look.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.400
Hm. Let's try
and culture that.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.480
So, how you feeling?

03:18.480 --> 03:21.120
Three wonderful weeks
recuperating,

03:21.120 --> 03:23.000
Mom waiting on me
hand and foot.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.800
Baseball, basketball,
football,

03:24.800 --> 03:27.240
all on TV
at the same time.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.680
Batteries recharged!
Who's she?

03:28.680 --> 03:31.760
Jean Crain.
Pat Crain's sister.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.720
The good-looking nurse
in Ophtho.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.840
Throat culture in two.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.760
You Crain girls
really knock me out.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.600
After being shot, when you left,
you were so depressed.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.040
Post-op blues.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.000
Now, I'm back
with a vengeance.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.360
Patrick Killarney.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.520
Maintenance men
took forever

03:51.520 --> 03:53.680
to patch up
the bullet holes in the wall,

03:53.680 --> 03:56.560
but they did
a good job.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.000
So long.
See you later.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
See ya.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.800
Oh, for crying out loud,
they're still in the sack!

04:15.800 --> 04:17.000
I wanted to give them the good news.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.560
Knock first, Mark.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.839
She's supposed to be our maid. She
spends more time between the sheets

04:21.839 --> 04:24.440
than changing them.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.280
Good morning.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.200
Yuri. This will start
your day off right.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.440
That's my robe.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.560
Your old robe.
Go on, tell him.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.360
I just got off the phone

04:34.360 --> 04:35.600
with Josiah Bartlett.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.200
He's a member of the Board
of Registration in Medicine.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.680
Thanks to my appeal,

04:39.680 --> 04:43.480
your medical licence has
finally been approved.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.520
Approved?

04:44.520 --> 04:47.320
Well, as a resident
under my supervision.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.480
Masha...

04:48.480 --> 04:52.480
(IN RUSSIAN)

04:54.200 --> 04:55.800
Oh, Dr Craig!

04:55.800 --> 04:57.760
Dr Craig. Thank you.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.200
Thank you so much.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.600
Oh, it's so wonderful.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.080
Thank you.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.080
Thank you.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.920
Oh, for the love
of Mike!

05:08.920 --> 05:10.840
Let's get
to the hospital.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.240
Yes, I will...
I'll shower.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.680
I'll fix breakfast.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.160
Mm-hmm.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.160
Hit this room with
an extra blast of Lysol.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.240
Elliot!

05:31.240 --> 05:33.560
Bought your ticket yet to
the Sweetbriar Orphanage dinner?

05:33.560 --> 05:34.640
Money goes to a good cause!

05:34.640 --> 05:37.080
Gee, I'd love to see you pick up
the Oliver Twist award

05:37.080 --> 05:38.520
tomorrow night, but I'm on call.

05:38.520 --> 05:42.240
Anyway, when I asked you to give
money to my pet charity the ASPCA,

05:42.240 --> 05:43.760
you told me I was barking up
the wrong tree.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.680
The cheque'll be
in the mail today.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.480
Come on... Hey, hey, hey!

05:47.480 --> 05:49.720
Who's the magic marker?

05:49.720 --> 05:53.720
Oh, I guess Wayne's
up to his old tricks.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.880
Oh, Victor Van Ehrlich!

05:56.880 --> 05:58.280
Cute.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.520
Hey, Lucy...

05:59.520 --> 06:02.160
No. Can't go to
the Lost Souls Soiree.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.600
But I'm being honoured by my fellows.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.520
What could possibly
be more important?

06:05.520 --> 06:07.920
Woolite night. Wringing out
my delicates.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.320
Good thing. Last I saw,
they're starting to sag.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.200
I heard that!

06:13.200 --> 06:15.600
You go along
with my diagnosis?

06:15.600 --> 06:17.840
I wouldn't wait for final cultures.
I'd go straight to Westphall.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.520
Westphall's pretty
busy right now.

06:20.520 --> 06:24.040
In other words, you're having
a hard time dealing with him

06:24.040 --> 06:27.600
since the two
of you broke up.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.600
Dr Auschlander.
We got a problem.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.160
We have two teenage girls
admitted this morning.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.040
They're toxic,
with headache, fever,

06:35.040 --> 06:36.520
and meningeal signs.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.600
One presented with
a petechial trunk rash.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.720
Did you get
lumbar punctures?

06:39.720 --> 06:42.080
Reviewed the preliminary
gram stains.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.680
Looks like meningococcal
meningitis.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.640
Then let's notify the
public health department.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.200
You better get the young ladies
into isolation

06:49.200 --> 06:53.200
before we have an epidemic
on our hands.

06:53.480 --> 06:57.480
Yuri, on this side of the Iron
Curtain, we don't skimp on the suds.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.360
Howdy doody.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.440
You're late, Ehrlich.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.280
Mrs Ziffle's bypass surgery

07:03.280 --> 07:05.080
isn't scheduled
for another 20 minutes.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.680
If I'm here before you,
you're late.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.800
Besides, there's
been a change.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.600
Meet Dr Yuri
Peltrovich.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.680
My pleasure.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.560
Along with performing
a conventional bypass,

07:14.560 --> 07:16.480
we'll be demonstrating
the Yag laser's ability

07:16.480 --> 07:19.040
to remove arterial
blockages.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.080
Love to see that.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.480
Who's performing
the angioscopy?

07:21.480 --> 07:24.680
Dr Peltrovich,
you dopeski.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.760
Mark, I want to observe.

07:26.760 --> 07:27.720
Just stay
out of the way.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.480
Just stay
out of the way.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.200
By the way, sir,
did I mention...

07:31.200 --> 07:33.480
That stupid
orphan fundraiser!

07:33.480 --> 07:35.280
You've done everything

07:35.280 --> 07:37.400
but tattoo the date
on my buttocks.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.840
Did you ever contribute

07:38.840 --> 07:40.920
to the Cushing Society's

07:40.920 --> 07:42.720
alcoholic research centre
like I asked?

07:42.720 --> 07:45.240
I'll have the donation there
by Friday.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.400
I'm not going.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.640
That's final.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.560
You're being honoured?

07:50.560 --> 07:53.200
The Oliver Twist award's
the high-water mark of my life.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.600
Next to operating
with Dr Craig, of course.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.960
And seeing Mrs Craig
in the stirrups.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.080
I'm so embarrassed.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.000
I fainted over my morning bagel.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.600
Had any change in diet?

08:04.600 --> 08:08.160
No, that's what I always
have for breakfast.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.160
Of course, I don't usually
throw up between halves.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.520
God, what a wreck.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.880
I usually look much
better than this.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.360
Under any stress
at work?

08:20.360 --> 08:22.920
No, not since
pollination time.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.200
Allergies?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.720
No, I work at the Franklin
Park greenhouses.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.400
Assistant supervisor
of horticulture.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.160
Tough year with the rose hybrids.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.840
Miss Chever, I'd like to
keep you for observation.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.080
What did you find?

08:35.080 --> 08:38.080
Nothing yet, but when those
tests get back, I'll know more.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.600
Vomiting blood
is serious enough to keep you.

08:40.600 --> 08:44.000
The begonias haven't been doing
very well. Can I say no?

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
I wouldn't advise it.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.920
Louie, how about
a lift to admissions?

08:57.280 --> 08:59.160
Louie, Louie...

08:59.160 --> 09:03.160
guess we got to go now.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.360
Everyone should have
eye protection.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.040
Check everyone has the goggles.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.560
Yes, Dr Peltrovich.
No problem.

09:09.560 --> 09:13.560
Thank you.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.160
These goggles,
it's like 3-D.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.120
Pay attention, Ehrlich.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.520
Having placed the patient

09:19.520 --> 09:21.320
on the heart-lung machine,

09:21.320 --> 09:23.600
I've exposed the anterior
descending artery.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.600
At this point, I turn things
over to Dr Peltrovich,

09:26.600 --> 09:29.480
who'll shed some light
on the Yag laser.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.880
Ha ha ha!

09:31.880 --> 09:33.320
That's excellent,
Dr Craig.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.600
I caught that.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.520
Shed some light,
laser... Ha ha!

09:37.520 --> 09:38.920
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:38.920 --> 09:42.800
I'll do my best to explain
this exciting procedure.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.640
As you know,
I come from Russia.

09:45.640 --> 09:49.640
However, I'm not a spy here
to steal technological secrets.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.240
Hello, Nicolai,
can you read?

09:53.240 --> 09:54.480
LAUGHTER

09:54.480 --> 09:56.120
Can we get on
with the angioscopy?

09:56.120 --> 09:58.280
Of course.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.440
First, I'll ask Dr Ehrlich

09:59.440 --> 10:01.800
to make a small distal
incision in the artery.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.160
Thrill and a half.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.600
The Yag uses a crystal

10:04.600 --> 10:07.960
to amplify light
at specific wavelengths.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.560
Properly focused,
the burst of laser energy

10:10.560 --> 10:13.800
will vaporise obstructions
of the artery.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.280
The use of the laser in cardiac
surgery is still in its infancy,

10:16.280 --> 10:17.960
but it's growing fast.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.680
While I'm threading

10:19.680 --> 10:21.800
the optical fibre
into the vessel,

10:21.800 --> 10:25.800
please make sure all the safety
goggles are in place.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.600
Without them,
the laser light could blind.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.440
I'd like to allow you both
more freedom,

10:45.440 --> 10:47.800
but you'll have to remain
in isolation

10:47.800 --> 10:50.200
until this meningitis
gets under control.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.640
You can take off your masks.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.120
I feel horrible,

10:53.120 --> 10:55.520
but guess
it's not so bad.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.320
I get to skip French
and there's room service.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.960
Hey, and me and Juanita get to
watch the soaps, right, Juanite?

11:00.960 --> 11:02.400
What will happen to us?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.960
You'll be given
penicillin through an IV

11:04.960 --> 11:07.160
in your arm that will
fight the bacteria

11:07.160 --> 11:08.840
and speed up your recovery

11:08.840 --> 11:10.120
How did we get this disease?

11:10.120 --> 11:13.560
You took a class bus trip
to Mystic Seaport?

11:13.560 --> 11:15.480
A schoolmate
carrying the bacteria

11:15.480 --> 11:17.480
must've passed the little bugger
round to you.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.880
There goes the
homecoming dance.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.480
Patricia, we haven't been able
to contact your parents.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.880
They're visiting my brother
in Winston-Salem.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.520
They're supposed to be
driving back tonight.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.640
Have you reached
my mother in Mexico City?

11:29.640 --> 11:31.280
A little while ago,
but the connection was bad.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.320
Couldn't hear each other.
We'll try again later on.

11:34.320 --> 11:38.280
Rest up, both of you.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.280
OK, I've located
the occlusion.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.400
I will trigger
the beam now.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.680
Direct hit.
This  is  the future!

11:48.680 --> 11:51.520
How far have you come
with laser angioscopy?

11:51.520 --> 11:55.080
In Russia, it is our hope
that soon this procedure

11:55.080 --> 11:57.440
will completely eliminate
open-heart surgery.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.920
That's a lot of nonsense.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.160
Of course,
among the old school,

12:01.160 --> 12:04.720
there's been much resistance
to the technological change.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.400
Dr Craig, you and I could
soon be obsolete!

12:08.400 --> 12:10.640
Good thing I'm young enough
to learn another field.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.160
Using a laser isn't difficult.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.960
I can teach you, Dr Ehrlich...

12:14.960 --> 12:16.400
and Dr Craig.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.280
Sounds fantastic.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.760
Ehrlich, zip up.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.240
Zipping.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.240
Zipping.

12:24.720 --> 12:28.560
BEEP

12:28.560 --> 12:30.720
Oh, boy...

12:30.720 --> 12:31.880
Ooh! Darth Vader! Sorry.

12:31.880 --> 12:35.880
When it comes to Star Wars,
you're a black hole.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.640
Elliott, have you seen
the woman in that bed?

12:53.640 --> 12:57.640
Try the waiting room.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.120
Elaine...

13:05.120 --> 13:08.000
This poor geranium's
been sitting here neglected.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.680
It's much too big
for the pot it's in.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.120
And since the coleus
in this pot's dead...

13:13.120 --> 13:14.840
We need to talk.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.120
What you mean is,

13:16.120 --> 13:17.560
you're going to talk,

13:17.560 --> 13:19.000
and I should listen.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.520
I got your
blood tests back.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.000
And you, uh...

13:23.000 --> 13:24.720
You're very ill.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.800
&lt; That is...

13:27.800 --> 13:29.360
You have leukaemia.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.200
I know.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.200
Oh, look, what
beautiful roots.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.840
Why didn't you tell me
down in ER?

13:35.840 --> 13:38.080
Leukaemia's not
a part of my life any more.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.200
Have you been
on chemotherapy?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.840
I was, for a while.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.840
Until my hair fell out.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.480
I puked and ached all over. &gt;

13:46.480 --> 13:48.160
It's no way to live.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.760
So I quit. And I'm not
going to start again.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.520
Your disease has entered
the acute phase.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.240
Without chemo
you probably won't survive a year.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.680
That's what the doctors at
Springfield College told me

13:59.680 --> 14:01.280
seven years ago.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.920
Here we are.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.920
Plenty of room to grow.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.040
Someone's giving Victor
a hard time.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.000
Are you going
to that dinner?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.280
I invited Victor
to a fundraiser once,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.880
for the crisis centre
suicide hotline.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.880
Know what he told me?
"Go jump off a roof."

14:36.680 --> 14:39.560
In Russia, if you show up
for work early,

14:39.560 --> 14:41.880
you're a saboteur.

14:41.880 --> 14:45.440
If you show up late, you're
the enemy of socialism.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.840
If you come on time...

14:47.840 --> 14:49.880
"where did you
get the watch?"

14:49.880 --> 14:51.800
LAUGHTER

14:51.800 --> 14:53.480
Funny.  Thank you.

14:53.480 --> 14:57.480
That is if world domination and
repression of human values is a joke.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.640
I appreciate Dr Peltrovich's
sense of humour.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.080
A survival instinct.

15:02.080 --> 15:06.080
Necessary where there's fear
and little freedom of speech.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.160
Like rounds with Mark!

15:08.160 --> 15:10.680
Excuse me -
no pepper at my table.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.360
How about salt, too?

15:12.360 --> 15:14.040
SALT II. Quick.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.360
May I say, you're quite a whiz
in the OR as well.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.240
You should have seen
Peltrovich work.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.240
Yeah, Ehrlich. We all know.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.680
Congratulations,
orphan-of-the-year.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.680
Thanks. Will you be attending?

15:23.680 --> 15:25.520
I'll be taking care of Tommy, sorry.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.520
I'm preparing for
the arrival of my husband.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.360
And you, sir?

15:30.360 --> 15:31.520
Oh, I...

15:31.520 --> 15:35.360
It's bake night at the Women's
Auxiliary Luncheon.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.320
I'm buttering
Katharine's muffins.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.200
I understand.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.520
An orphan becoming
a heart surgeon.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.920
Such an American fable.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.920
You know a lot about America,
huh, Yuri?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.120
It's a wonderful country

15:52.120 --> 15:55.000
which sometimes ignores
its faults.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.400
Not much we can do
about the San Andreas.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.800
Faults?

15:58.800 --> 16:01.400
What about World War II?

16:01.400 --> 16:05.400
The US had to jump in and rescue
your collective butt from the Nazis.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.600
So then you take over
Eastern Europe,

16:07.600 --> 16:10.160
and we're left
standing at the Yalta.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.400
Perhaps Roosevelt
misjudged Stalin.

16:12.400 --> 16:16.400
The communists are only interested
in running the whole show.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.200
As I saw in Vietnam,

16:18.200 --> 16:20.120
socialism just
filled in the vacuum

16:20.120 --> 16:22.440
created by
the misuse of power.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.680
Oh, please. South Vietnam,
South Korea...

16:25.680 --> 16:27.960
No national character.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.120
Neither one of you
had enough pride

16:30.120 --> 16:34.040
to fight off the Reds.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.320
Whatever the reason,

16:35.320 --> 16:38.960
both superpowers have
to keep their finger
off that button,

16:38.960 --> 16:41.280
start healing and feeding
people who need help.

16:41.280 --> 16:45.280
Let's not start with
We Are The World.

16:46.640 --> 16:50.640
One tragedy after another
since December 7, 1941.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.960
Some think it was
the bombing of Hiroshima

16:53.960 --> 16:55.880
that was the turning
point.

16:55.880 --> 16:59.800
Then there are the incursions,
like Afghanistan.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.360
You Russians think you
can waltz in and get pushy

17:02.360 --> 17:04.839
with people who spend their whole
lives building up the place.

17:04.839 --> 17:07.560
And you have the right to order
everyone around, right?

17:07.560 --> 17:11.560
Not only the right, but
the firepower to back it up.

17:11.720 --> 17:15.720
I've got patients to see.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.760
Perhaps it would be best

17:17.760 --> 17:20.160
to keep politics
out of the hospital.

17:20.160 --> 17:24.160
'He's looking for a raise on top of
a salary we're all admiring already!

17:24.440 --> 17:26.880
'Mark, thanks for the call.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.440
'Says here, John wants to have
his own show some day.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.640
'I think you got this information
from the other source.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.760
'I do have a fantasy...

17:34.760 --> 17:36.960
Last period.
Chemistry with Mr Crampton.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.960
Yeah, I'd be in French with
Mrs Dumas and her fat, white arms.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.120
Ou est la bibliotheque?

17:45.360 --> 17:49.040
Boy, I feel like crap.

17:49.040 --> 17:52.360
We've reached your folks
and they're on their way.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.600
Are they going to be mad?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.400
Why would they be mad?

17:55.400 --> 17:57.680
Cos we're sick?
Hey, my parents are cool.

17:57.680 --> 17:58.680
They trust me.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.720
We're still trying
to reach your mom.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.160
Down near Mexico City where we live

18:03.160 --> 18:05.600
was destroyed by the earthquake
last year.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.080
I saw that on the news.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.160
Yeah, Juanita's house
was totally demolished.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.600
That's why my mother
sent me to the United States.

18:12.600 --> 18:16.040
As an exchange student.
Nowhere for all of us to live.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.720
Mama says we'll build
a new house.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.920
But how?
There is no money.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.960
I feel terrible.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.560
Actually, the earthquake's
made it possible

18:26.560 --> 18:29.200
for me to have a wonderful life
in the US with your family.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.000
No, I mean
I really feel terrible.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.560
I'm going to lose my...

18:33.560 --> 18:34.800
Take it easy.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.760
(VOMITS) &gt;

18:38.760 --> 18:41.840
How come I never see you in
your room? You should be in bed.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.800
For that matter, so should I.

18:43.800 --> 18:47.160
I took this sweet older woman
back to her room.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.000
I had her out for a spin
in the walker.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.840
Oh, look - as long as I'm stuck
here, I may as well keep busy.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.800
That's a classic case
of denial.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.720
You can't face
your disease and accept treatment,

18:57.720 --> 19:01.120
so you turn your attention
everywhere else.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.840
Waiting for Godot.
College production.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.240
Director had
a weird concept...

19:06.240 --> 19:10.240
I played the tree.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.360
No lines...

19:13.360 --> 19:15.920
plenty of time
to think onstage.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.920
This was a year after
I'd been diagnosed
and had started chemo.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.240
I was a little out of things,

19:22.240 --> 19:24.560
but I was really
into this part -

19:24.560 --> 19:27.240
thinking like a tree.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.480
And one night, it hits me.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.240
I'm deciduous.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.360
Well, trees have
their seasons.

19:34.360 --> 19:37.680
There's death
followed by life.

19:37.680 --> 19:41.680
So, instead of accepting the
miserable terms leukaemia offers -

19:42.680 --> 19:44.800
letting the disease
run my life -

19:44.800 --> 19:47.000
I've chosen to let my life
run the disease.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.840
You're being
totally unrealistic.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.880
Doctors want patients
to accept one role -

19:51.880 --> 19:54.840
passive, obedient,
unstimulated bodies

19:54.840 --> 19:58.040
lying in beds under
fluorescent lights.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.040
If you knew what
that was like...

20:00.040 --> 20:01.480
you'd know how
counterproductive that is.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.400
I've been a patient.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.360
Three weeks ago I was working
in the ER,

20:05.360 --> 20:08.280
and a woman came in gunning for
her husband and shot me instead.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.920
I was dead for an hour
while they cut me open.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.400
OK, you were dead.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.080
But now you're alive.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.160
Big deal!

20:20.160 --> 20:22.080
The world is a cesspool,

20:22.080 --> 20:24.480
a pit, where maggots
greet you with gunfire,

20:24.480 --> 20:27.160
and scumball drunks
cross over the centre line.

20:27.160 --> 20:31.160
The whole place stinks.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.640
Smile.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.880
Shouldn't you be at home resting up
for tomorrow's Orphan Annie award?

21:01.880 --> 21:04.280
Please, I'm tired
of the cruel jokes.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.160
Especially these.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.360
Especially these.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.600
This one's
kinda flattering.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.040
Ha ha.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.000
Oh, come on, Victor.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.520
You're the king
of insensitive jokes.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.800
Doesn't mean I like them.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.640
You wouldn't understand.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.120
You Greeks have
a strong sense of family.

21:20.120 --> 21:24.120
I read the Iliad. Everyone's
on a first-name basis.

21:28.240 --> 21:32.240
You know, I was seven when
my parents died in the car accident.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.000
Closed-casket funeral.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.880
I never even saw them
to say good-bye.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.760
Separated from
my brother and sister.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.600
Raised by
my Aunt Charice.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.480
I thought you liked her.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.400
I didn't have a choice.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.560
She drank, she was never there
when I needed her.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.240
She's not even coming
tomorrow night.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.680
It's bad enough
that the people you care about

21:57.680 --> 21:59.720
aren't around
when you're growing up.

21:59.720 --> 22:03.720
But tomorrow night,
nobody I care about
will be there either.

22:04.720 --> 22:08.000
Oh, what the heck.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.960
My delicates can wait.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.840
Will you still take me?

22:12.840 --> 22:14.800
Lucy, honey bunny.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.200
You're the greatest!

22:16.200 --> 22:18.160
Oh, while we're on the subject,

22:18.160 --> 22:20.560
would you unload some of
these tickets, please?

22:20.560 --> 22:22.000
Thank you!

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
But...

22:26.640 --> 22:29.320
This is a mistake, Ellen.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.200
I think it'll be fun
to see old home movies.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.760
Masha and I found these
cleaning out closets for goodwill

22:34.760 --> 22:36.680
and she wants to see them.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.080
I hope you didn't give away
any of my clothes.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.200
Well, I did pull a few things
for Yuri.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.320
Great. He's practically taking
the clothes off my back.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.080
Here, let me - you need to get
the film right on the sprockets.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.800
Why are you such
an old bear today?

22:48.800 --> 22:51.720
Oh, good.
Yuri, right over there.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.120
I'm so excited
seeing home movies.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.560
OK, I'm ready.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.560
Ellen, get the lights, please.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.200
Mrs Craig, is that you?

23:03.200 --> 23:05.600
The hats we wore then!

23:05.600 --> 23:08.480
Look at the fins
on that Buick, huh?

23:08.480 --> 23:11.040
A car was a car in 1956.

23:11.040 --> 23:14.960
America was in the midst
of incredible prosperity.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.120
Helen and I
were just married.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.560
Started with nothing.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.000
Listen. My dowry was...

23:20.000 --> 23:21.240
Peanuts.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.720
We realised how darn lucky we were

23:23.720 --> 23:26.080
to be a young couple
starting our life in this country.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.840
Which is the way you should feel.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.040
What does that mean?

23:29.040 --> 23:32.640
It means remember who
helped you get this far.

23:32.640 --> 23:36.640
You know, I'm getting sick of you
treating me as a bad child!

23:38.040 --> 23:40.680
You've tried to show me up
from the word go.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.160
I opened the door for you.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.400
You slammed it in my face!

23:45.400 --> 23:46.520
You're ungrateful!

23:46.520 --> 23:48.440
And you are a petty little dictator,

23:48.440 --> 23:51.160
corrupted by your own
illusion of power!

23:51.160 --> 23:52.840
OK! That does it, get out!

23:52.840 --> 23:54.040
Mark, please.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.320
They both have jobs.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.560
They can pull
their own wagon.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.960
As of now, Masha no longer
works for you!

23:59.960 --> 24:02.680
Come!

24:02.680 --> 24:06.680
And I expect that den
to be as clean as an OR!

24:08.400 --> 24:12.400
An American OR!

24:13.560 --> 24:16.920
Aw, now. Come on.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.120
Come on, Ellen.
Don't cry.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.880
Hey, they'll be fine.

24:20.880 --> 24:24.880
That's my baby!

24:33.160 --> 24:36.360
One dish, two dish,
red fish, blue fish.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.280
Look, Barbara.
Here's Masha.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.840
I'm so glad to see you.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.400
I've been worried sick.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.800
Where did you two go
last night?

24:44.800 --> 24:47.200
Howard Johnson's.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.120
I'm just furious
with Mark.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.000
I apologise
about last night, Masha.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.200
No. No. No.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.320
What are you doing?

24:56.320 --> 24:58.720
It's my job to clean house.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.200
No, no, no, no.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.600
Yuri's right.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.520
You shouldn't work for us any more.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.000
We're friends.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.320
When Dr Craig and Yuri left house
yesterday, they friends. Happy!

25:08.320 --> 25:10.880
Then they come back
yesterday afternoon - boom!

25:10.880 --> 25:14.200
What could have happened?
Yuri say nothing.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.640
Well, Yuri wandered
into Mark's barnyard,

25:15.640 --> 25:17.680
and Mark feels threatened.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.360
Dr Craig is great surgeon.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.000
There's plenty of room for both.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.200
But not in his spotlight.

25:23.200 --> 25:27.000
Men are so territorial, you know?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.440
Mark's father taught him

25:28.440 --> 25:31.360
never to back down
from a challenge.

25:31.360 --> 25:35.360
Yuri is moskvich - proud of
his heritage. Never conquered.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.320
Male pride.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.240
We gals would never act like that,
would we, Barbara?

25:40.240 --> 25:42.280
I wish we could
bring them together.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.840
If we don't do it,
nobody else will.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.800
Hmm.

25:46.800 --> 25:50.800
Ooh. There we go.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.520
You know, all the pressures
put on my son, Steven -

25:58.520 --> 26:01.080
to achieve, to be the best,
to be a man.

26:01.080 --> 26:05.080
Eventually,
that's why he died.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.800
We mothers just want our children
to grow up safely.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.400
Last night Patricia's parents
brought us robes, pyjamas.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.320
Many nice things.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.680
I only wish
Patricia felt better.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.080
Dr Auschlander says
you're recovering fast.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.960
That's why he ordered
another chest X-ray.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.720
Well...

26:28.720 --> 26:31.120
back to bed!

26:31.120 --> 26:33.560
Clear!

26:33.560 --> 26:35.800
Another hundred of lidocaine,
then let's go again

26:35.800 --> 26:36.840
Get her out of here!

26:36.840 --> 26:37.640
What happened?

26:37.640 --> 26:40.160
Infection involved the heart.
She coded.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.360
Go!

26:41.360 --> 26:44.680
Clear!

26:44.680 --> 26:45.920
BEEPING

26:45.920 --> 26:48.080
Sinus tach.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.080
She'll be fine.

26:50.080 --> 26:52.400
A measly 15 bucks!

26:52.400 --> 26:54.760
This means
so much to Victor.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.240
If you could have
seen him yesterday,

26:56.240 --> 26:58.760
heartsick because nobody's
coming, in tears.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.520
heartsick because nobody's
coming, in tears.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.960
Or the ticket.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.400
I've got rounds.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.320
All right. This is on me,

27:05.320 --> 27:07.720
but you better show up.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.640
I don't believe it.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.720
Hope your acceptance speech
is good.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.480
Hey, hey. All right!

27:13.480 --> 27:14.920
Selling like hot cakes!

27:14.920 --> 27:18.200
Yeah! (And I'm
greasing the griddle).

27:18.200 --> 27:20.360
# Old King Cole
was a merry old... #

27:20.360 --> 27:21.640
Man.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.080
Man. OK!

27:23.080 --> 27:26.440
# Old King Cole
was a merry old man... #

27:26.440 --> 27:28.320
Man doesn't rhyme
with Cole.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.760
What rhymes with man?

27:29.760 --> 27:31.160
Stan.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.960
Stan! Great!

27:32.960 --> 27:35.520
# Old King Stan
was a merry old man

27:35.520 --> 27:37.600
# And a merry old man was he

27:37.600 --> 27:39.040
# He called for his pipe

27:39.040 --> 27:40.480
# And he called for his bowl

27:40.480 --> 27:42.720
# And he called for his fiddlers...

27:42.720 --> 27:43.400
To shut up.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.680
To shut up.

27:45.680 --> 27:49.040
# Old King Stan
was a merry old man

27:49.040 --> 27:50.720
# And a merry old man was he

27:50.720 --> 27:52.600
# He called for his pipe

27:52.600 --> 27:54.040
# And he called for his bowl

27:54.040 --> 27:58.040
# And he called for
his fiddlers to shut up. #

28:02.080 --> 28:05.000
There's also
a pulmonary flow murmur.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Pulmonic stenosis?

28:07.000 --> 28:10.920
No, it's more like
an atrial septal defect.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.000
Possible.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.320
The cardiac ECHO
will pin it down.

28:16.320 --> 28:20.320
There's nothing to worry about,
Mr Freed.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.320
Dr Peltrovich, how did you
make that diagnosis

28:27.320 --> 28:30.120
just by listening
through a stethoscope?

28:30.120 --> 28:32.600
In our country,
there are few machines

28:32.600 --> 28:34.480
for the number of patients.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.640
We learn to evaluate cases
without the aid of technology.

28:36.640 --> 28:39.480
Well, in this country,
we  have  the technology.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.680
So don't jump
to conclusions.

28:41.680 --> 28:45.680
Rounds are over.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.640
&lt; ..whether you
like it or not!

28:48.640 --> 28:51.280
It's gonna be boring
and I don't like him anyway.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.200
Like isn't the problem here,
I don't care...

28:53.200 --> 28:55.120
I don't  want  to go!

28:55.120 --> 28:56.560
(SLAP) How about this, huh?

28:56.560 --> 28:57.400
You gonna buy a ticket?

28:57.400 --> 28:58.200
You gonna buy a ticket?

28:58.200 --> 28:59.280
You gonna buy a ticket?

28:59.280 --> 29:00.720
Give me that ticket!

29:00.720 --> 29:02.360
All right, twerp,
you  better  be there,

29:02.360 --> 29:03.400
that's all I gotta say.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.480
If you're not,
there'll be hell to pay.

29:05.480 --> 29:08.560
Have a good time(!)

29:08.560 --> 29:11.600
Ah, Luther, you're next.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.040
Hi, Wayne. What can
I do for you?

29:13.040 --> 29:14.760
Lab for Elaine Cheever.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.120
Remember me?

29:16.120 --> 29:17.360
Sore throat,

29:17.360 --> 29:19.760
turned out to be
peritonsillar abscess.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.520
Your boyfriend likes
playing with fire.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.560
Yeah, see that's what
I wanted to tell the nurses.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.160
If a big guy
comes looking for me,

29:26.160 --> 29:27.880
don't tell him
my room number.

29:27.880 --> 29:31.880
He tried to set me on fire once.
I know he'll try again.

29:32.400 --> 29:36.400
Sound like a fun couple(!)

29:39.200 --> 29:41.600
These results
got to be wrong.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.360
Bad news?

29:43.360 --> 29:47.360
I admitted a girl yesterday
with acute leukaemia,

29:47.480 --> 29:49.680
refused chemo,
and according to this,

29:49.680 --> 29:51.440
she's in complete remission.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.280
That's impossible.
Come on.

29:54.280 --> 29:58.280
Unless she really is
deciduous.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.680
OK?  OK.

30:02.680 --> 30:04.920
What is it you want?

30:04.920 --> 30:08.000
Yuri, give Mark
another chance.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.840
He insulted me.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.600
Treats me like inferior.

30:13.600 --> 30:17.040
I know. Just like
everybody else.

30:17.040 --> 30:20.240
But really,
Mark can be very sweet.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.800
Besides, if you want
to work at St Eligius,

30:22.800 --> 30:26.080
you have to
get along with Mark.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.640
I can help, Yuri.

30:27.640 --> 30:31.160
I know him better
than anyone else.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.240
He thinks you're
a fine surgeon.

30:33.240 --> 30:37.240
He wants to be friends.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.240
You think that
aortic aneurysm here

30:39.240 --> 30:41.440
is large enough to affect
the renal arteries?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.520
It could explain
the man's hypertension.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.920
No. That aneurysm's
much too low.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.680
Practically
at the bifurcation.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.200
Yeah. You're right.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.720
I know I'm right.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.560
Good thing you've cut back on
your administrative duties.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.000
You need practice.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.240
You know, Mark - one of these days,

30:56.240 --> 30:58.200
somebody's going to punch you
right in the snout.

30:58.200 --> 31:01.000
Fat chance! They better hope
they knock me out if they do.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.600
Once, it could've been me.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.080
Where did you
learn to box?

31:05.080 --> 31:07.480
From a priest
that used to work here.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.920
KNOCK ON DOOR

31:08.920 --> 31:10.320
KNOCK ON DOOR

31:10.320 --> 31:12.400
Excuse me.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.960
What do you want?

31:13.960 --> 31:16.760
Please accept my apologies
for Yuri.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.480
I should never
have let you con me

31:19.480 --> 31:20.880
into helping him immigrate.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.880
Yuri is very important surgeon
in Soviet Union.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.240
It is hard for him
to need your help.

31:27.240 --> 31:29.480
Over here,
he has little choice.

31:29.480 --> 31:29.920
KNOCK ON DOOR

31:29.920 --> 31:30.960
KNOCK ON DOOR

31:30.960 --> 31:32.960
Is Donald here?

31:32.960 --> 31:34.240
Yeah, he's under the desk.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.920
Ally ally oxen free,
you can come out now, Donald.

31:36.920 --> 31:40.920
Cet homme est incroyable!

31:41.040 --> 31:43.520
I have cleaned
house for you.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.120
I know you like order.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.400
At hospital, too.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.600
It will help put things
back in order

31:49.600 --> 31:52.080
if you give Yuri
another chance.

31:52.080 --> 31:56.080
He think you very great surgeon.
He wants to be friends.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.640
Want to watch TV?

31:59.640 --> 32:02.360
No.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.600
Ladies...

32:04.600 --> 32:06.640
Rough morning for you.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.360
How are you feeling?

32:09.360 --> 32:11.200
What if my heart
stops beating again?

32:11.200 --> 32:13.200
That's why you're here.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.120
So that we can help you.

32:15.120 --> 32:18.160
That's not much comfort.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.800
Juanita...

32:20.800 --> 32:23.200
You mother and I spoke
a few minutes ago.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.120
Was she upset?

32:24.120 --> 32:26.080
Was she upset?

32:26.080 --> 32:27.560
She wants you to fly home.

32:27.560 --> 32:28.640
No!

32:28.640 --> 32:31.280
Your mother wants
to take care of you.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.720
There's nothing for me
in Mexico City.

32:33.720 --> 32:37.720
No nice place to live, no school
like here. Nothing.  Please...

32:38.040 --> 32:41.120
She's your legal guardian.
And you're well enough to go.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.680
There's little I can do.

32:42.680 --> 32:43.840
I'm very sorry.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.440
I spoke to the Kimballs.

32:45.440 --> 32:49.440
They're arranging for you
to leave tonight.

32:57.480 --> 32:58.840
I don't want to go home.

32:58.840 --> 33:02.840
I don't want to go home.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.720
..We'll finish going through
resident evaluations tomorrow.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.200
Next year will be too soon!

33:10.200 --> 33:11.680
(TANNOY) Code red. Third floor.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.000
Code red means
there's a fire.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Aah! Somebody help me!

33:24.280 --> 33:27.440
I knew he'd come.

33:27.440 --> 33:31.440
&lt; Get the gauze ready.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.280
Some scissors.

33:33.280 --> 33:37.280
Here you go, Doctor.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.160
You're not even excited.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.880
Always knew I'd be fine.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.800
I've had your results checked
and re-checked.

33:50.800 --> 33:53.640
Yesterday was my first day back
since I got shot.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.240
Telling everybody I'm OK.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.400
But the truth is,
I'm out of my mind.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.360
Terrified it could happen again.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.760
Since I got
your results back...

34:02.760 --> 34:04.200
Maybe you're right,

34:04.200 --> 34:05.800
positive attitudes,

34:05.800 --> 34:07.800
the world doesn't have to be
such a lousy place.

34:07.800 --> 34:11.000
Hey! Be careful!

34:11.000 --> 34:11.960
You OK?

34:11.960 --> 34:13.760
Yeah.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.719
You all right?

34:16.719 --> 34:20.719
E equals MC squared?

34:21.840 --> 34:25.840
Or did I hear
that somewhere?

34:25.880 --> 34:29.280
Bang. You're dead!

34:29.280 --> 34:33.280
Can't kill me.
I'm invincible.

34:36.400 --> 34:40.400
Hi.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.639
Miss your friend?

34:42.639 --> 34:46.040
Seeing her jump around
made me feel even worse.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.320
You're responding differently
to the antibiotics than she did.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.040
Yeah, by going downhill.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.679
Recovery can take time.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.600
But I could keep sliding and
never fully recover, right?

34:55.600 --> 34:57.400
Yes.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.960
And die?

34:58.960 --> 35:02.240
Very unlikely.

35:02.240 --> 35:03.600
It's not fair,

35:03.600 --> 35:06.240
and Juanita expects me
to give a damn

35:06.240 --> 35:08.680
just because she has to
go to Mexico City.

35:08.680 --> 35:12.320
How can this happen?
She gets to blow out of here,

35:12.320 --> 35:15.200
and my life is totally screwed up.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.240
It's the luck of the draw.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.720
You have money, a good home,

35:19.720 --> 35:21.800
good parents who understand you,
but you're very sick.

35:21.800 --> 35:25.720
Juanita's well, but she
has nothing in Mexico City.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.920
Life's all tradeoffs.

35:27.920 --> 35:31.920
That's not good enough.

35:33.120 --> 35:37.120
I agree.

35:37.840 --> 35:41.320
Barbara's down for the night.
I put the intercom next to her.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.320
Breathing softly.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.800
We're having guests?

35:45.800 --> 35:48.720
My grandmother's coin silver
is on the table,

35:48.720 --> 35:51.000
and you're serving
take-out Chinese?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.440
No more Masha to cook,
remember?

35:52.440 --> 35:54.400
All of a sudden
you've forgotten how to cook?

35:54.400 --> 35:56.280
I wanted something neutral.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.040
Then we should serve
Swiss chard.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.640
KNOCK ON DOOR

35:59.640 --> 36:00.920
Mark, please, try.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.920
I'll be the perfect host.

36:03.920 --> 36:07.920
Masha, Yuri,
welcome, welcome.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.080
Finish your
post-op rounds OK?

36:10.080 --> 36:11.120
Yes. Fine.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.720
Good. Ellen has a nice
dinner for us,

36:13.720 --> 36:15.160
but why don't we start out

36:15.160 --> 36:17.400
with a glass of Moet
in the living room?

36:17.400 --> 36:18.640
We'll be right there.

36:18.640 --> 36:22.640
Come on, Yuri.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.480
Boy, when I
see Chandler...

36:32.480 --> 36:34.960
Smart guy. I didn't know
anything could be this boring.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.720
I would've paid 30 bucks
not to come.

36:36.720 --> 36:39.560
Hearing the orphanage choir
singing Poor Little Lamb,

36:39.560 --> 36:40.800
it was kind of heart-warming.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.440
So's the defibrillator.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.720
MICROPHONE FEEDBACK

36:45.720 --> 36:47.200
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.800
Sweetbriar Orphanage
has been caring for the wayward

36:50.800 --> 36:53.920
and homeless waifs of Boston
since 1932.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.840
Every year since then,
we've sought to bestow

36:56.840 --> 36:59.720
the Oliver Twist award
upon an orphan

36:59.720 --> 37:02.640
for his or her
outstanding achievement

37:02.640 --> 37:05.320
in the fields
of letters, science,

37:05.320 --> 37:06.400
and in the arts.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.840
This year's recipient,

37:08.840 --> 37:12.000
for his work as a dedicated
surgical resident

37:12.000 --> 37:14.680
and one-time local
television personality...

37:14.680 --> 37:18.680
Dr Victor Ehrlich!

37:18.800 --> 37:22.800
Thank you.

37:25.400 --> 37:29.400
Please, I'd like some more!

37:31.280 --> 37:33.760
Thank you.
You're too kind.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.120
Um...

37:36.120 --> 37:37.720
When I was a child,

37:37.720 --> 37:39.600
I remember reading
Oliver Twist.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.520
Maybe I just
saw the movie, but...

37:42.520 --> 37:43.800
I got to tell you,

37:43.800 --> 37:47.800
it scared the Dickens
out of me.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.640
No, seriously, being an orphan
is really kind of terrifying.

37:51.640 --> 37:54.720
You don't know
who you are.

37:54.720 --> 37:57.320
No father's after-shave
to try on.

37:57.320 --> 38:01.320
No mother to let you
lick the spoon.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.640
We begin life
outside of the litter.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.360
PAGER BEEPS

38:05.360 --> 38:07.720
People are constantly
reminding us that we're deprived,

38:07.720 --> 38:11.360
we're starting out
on the short side,

38:11.360 --> 38:13.720
but what are the rules
for a, quote, great life,

38:13.720 --> 38:16.360
and who decides them?

38:16.360 --> 38:19.720
We all have handicaps,
we're all missing something.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.480
I see people struggle
to overcome loss

38:22.480 --> 38:24.400
every day around St Eligius.

38:24.400 --> 38:27.800
The life we have
is the life we have.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.040
Certainly, orphans
aren't lesser people.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.400
Look at Romulus and Remus,

38:33.400 --> 38:37.400
though I'm not recommending
that you be suckled by wolves!

38:38.600 --> 38:41.200
Fellow orphans...

38:41.200 --> 38:43.280
..always remember
that you're never alone.

38:43.280 --> 38:47.280
Thank you. Thank you.

38:51.880 --> 38:52.920
Hi.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.960
Hi.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.880
I haven't seen much
of you lately.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.680
Oh, busy. You know.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.800
Everything OK?

38:59.800 --> 39:00.920
Yeah.

39:00.920 --> 39:04.920
Good.

39:06.120 --> 39:10.120
Well, I've got to go.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.920
How is she?

39:25.920 --> 39:27.000
No.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
She returned from
the children's ward,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.520
she told the nurse she hit her head
and wanted something for pain.

39:31.520 --> 39:35.520
By the time the nurse got back
with an aspirin, Elaine was dead.

39:42.960 --> 39:46.600
The leukaemia left her
with a low platelet count,

39:46.600 --> 39:49.200
so her blood
wasn't clotting.

39:49.200 --> 39:50.560
Blow to the head

39:50.560 --> 39:54.560
probably caused
a cerebral haemorrhage.

40:06.120 --> 40:09.000
She changed the way
I looked at things.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.200
Taught me not
to be afraid.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.640
Made me believe

40:12.640 --> 40:16.640
we had a fighting chance
in the universe.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
Let's go, Wayne.

40:25.720 --> 40:29.720
You made me believe.

40:30.160 --> 40:34.160
You gave me hope.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.240
Damn you!

40:37.240 --> 40:41.240
Wayne...

40:47.320 --> 40:49.320
Come on. Let's, uh...

40:49.320 --> 40:52.320
Let's go take a drive.
Up to Vermont.

40:52.320 --> 40:54.000
See the leaves turn.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.920
It's too late.
They're dead.

40:57.920 --> 41:01.920
We'll go anyway.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.480
KNOCK ON DOOR

41:10.480 --> 41:12.040
KNOCK ON DOOR

41:12.040 --> 41:14.040
Hi. Got a minute?

41:14.040 --> 41:16.040
Please. Come in.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.440
I saw Patricia Kimball
a little while ago.

41:18.440 --> 41:19.760
How is she?

41:19.760 --> 41:22.240
She's bugged, she's not
getting any better.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.680
Understandable.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.000
I didn't know
what to tell her.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.720
What, fate deals the cards,
it's the hand you get?

41:29.720 --> 41:32.480
We all have
to accept limitations.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.680
I agree with Patricia.
It's not fair.

41:34.680 --> 41:36.800
Believe me, watching many
of my contemporaries

41:36.800 --> 41:38.320
cruising along at 70

41:38.320 --> 41:40.640
while I fight
this liver cancer

41:40.640 --> 41:42.080
hardly seems fair.

41:42.080 --> 41:46.080
Every time Ed Havenhurst jogs past
my front door in the pink...

41:47.120 --> 41:51.120
..I wish I had a rifle.

41:52.120 --> 41:55.960
I was born Italian,
Catholic,

41:55.960 --> 41:57.400
lower class...

41:57.400 --> 41:59.120
female.

41:59.120 --> 42:02.280
My life was programmed
by repression -

42:02.280 --> 42:06.280
repressed thought,
repressed sex.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.400
I watched Donald walk out
of our relationship

42:09.400 --> 42:13.400
because I feel
ambiguous about sex.

42:14.520 --> 42:18.520
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
make you feel uncomfortable.

42:18.840 --> 42:20.760
I worked
with Helen Rosenthal

42:20.760 --> 42:22.680
through three
of her divorces.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.920
Shocked every time!
I thought she was a floozy.

42:24.920 --> 42:28.920
Now I realise
all along she was right.

42:30.800 --> 42:34.800
What am I trying to preserve
that's so precious?

42:36.520 --> 42:38.480
I'm ready for a change.

42:38.480 --> 42:41.000
You've already changed a lot.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.520
You started as a nurse,

42:42.520 --> 42:45.080
now becoming a doctor.

42:45.080 --> 42:48.880
Career, love, happiness.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.000
I want the works.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
I hope you get it.

42:54.680 --> 42:58.680
You'd be the first.

42:59.720 --> 43:01.680
Fortune cookies -

43:01.680 --> 43:04.080
my favourite thing
about eating Chinese.

43:04.080 --> 43:08.080
Here, Masha. Yuri.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.640
Let's see...

43:11.640 --> 43:15.040
"You will never have to worry
about a steady income."

43:15.040 --> 43:16.080
LAUGHTER

43:16.080 --> 43:18.120
That is if Yuri doesn't
put me out of business

43:18.120 --> 43:21.160
with his laser.

43:21.160 --> 43:22.760
It's not in my intention.

43:22.760 --> 43:24.240
Oh, of course.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.120
You don't believe me.

43:26.120 --> 43:30.120
Let's just say I've been waiting
for an apology all night.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.440
You?

43:31.440 --> 43:33.400
I've been waiting.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.040
What do I have to apologise for?

43:35.040 --> 43:37.320
You're the one that tossed down
the gauntlet.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.720
Mark, hush.

43:38.720 --> 43:41.560
I thought
we could have dinner

43:41.560 --> 43:43.400
and resolve our differences,

43:43.400 --> 43:45.560
but it is clear

43:45.560 --> 43:49.560
that you will never apologise
for your behaviour.

43:50.040 --> 43:54.040
And I will not submit
to your authority.

43:55.280 --> 43:57.960
Therefore, I decide
to take the offer

43:57.960 --> 44:00.320
made to me
by Josiah Bartlett

44:00.320 --> 44:03.560
to become head of laser research
at Boston General.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.120
You what?

44:05.120 --> 44:06.440
I'm a grown man,

44:06.440 --> 44:10.000
and I have to follow
my own desires, my own wishes.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.080
Isn't that what you say
America is all about?

44:12.080 --> 44:14.840
Fine. You want
Independence Day?

44:14.840 --> 44:16.400
Here's a declaration -

44:16.400 --> 44:20.400
beat it.

44:22.400 --> 44:23.560
(Good-bye.)

44:23.560 --> 44:27.560
Masha! &gt;

44:32.000 --> 44:33.760
Benedict Arnold.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.680
Do you really blame him

44:35.680 --> 44:37.800
after the way you've behaved?

44:37.800 --> 44:39.000
Oh, here we go.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
That's what
I'm talking about.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.280
Who do you think
you are,

44:44.280 --> 44:46.200
inflicting your
point of view

44:46.200 --> 44:48.160
and your concerns
on the rest of the world?

44:48.160 --> 44:49.280
You can be such a bully!

44:49.280 --> 44:51.720
I've never wanted
to believe this before,

44:51.720 --> 44:54.240
but you are a confused
and insecure man,

44:54.240 --> 44:55.400
and I think you need help.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.520
What are you talking about?

44:57.520 --> 44:59.040
I want you to start therapy.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.240
My hand's fine.

45:00.240 --> 45:04.240
I  mean  a psychiatrist.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.520
I gotta be honest, Ehrlich,

45:25.520 --> 45:26.960
you were sincere, moving.

45:26.960 --> 45:29.360
And you hardly even
noticed his lisp.

45:29.360 --> 45:33.360
Whatever you guys dish out,
I can take. I'm a happy man.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.240
Excuse us, Victor.

45:35.240 --> 45:38.560
That was...quite
a speech you made up there,

45:38.560 --> 45:39.720
about being an orphan.

45:39.720 --> 45:42.040
Thank you.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.840
I don't really know
how to tell you this, but...

45:44.840 --> 45:46.600
Victor...
