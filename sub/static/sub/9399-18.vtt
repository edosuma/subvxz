00:38.050 --> 00:39.150
Let me take this part.

00:58.650 --> 01:00.550
You're a cute kid.
Thank you.

01:00.650 --> 01:01.450
You're welcome.

02:19.350 --> 02:20.150
Hey, you.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.950
Whatcha got there?
What's that?

03:53.250 --> 03:55.250
I think you drank too much.

03:55.950 --> 03:57.250
I think you're right.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.250
Nathan: damn.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.750
Think somebody got thrown
through a plate-Glass window.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.250
Dude, it seriously smells
like ass in here.

04:04.650 --> 04:05.950
And rotten cheese.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.450
Go away.

04:07.650 --> 04:09.250
Ew, and bad breath.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.050
I said, "go away."

04:11.450 --> 04:13.250
Ho...
holy crap.

04:13.450 --> 04:14.250
What?

04:14.550 --> 04:15.650
Have you
seen your head?

04:15.950 --> 04:16.950
Not lately.

04:17.350 --> 04:19.250
You have a mohawk.
I do?

04:21.649 --> 04:24.450
Awesome.
Can i get one, daddy?

04:24.550 --> 04:26.950
Sure, if you want to look goofy
like your uncle lucas.

04:27.150 --> 04:30.150
Kind of like he has a tail...
just on his head.

04:30.850 --> 04:33.350
Jamie, why don't you go get luke
a bottle of water, huh?

04:33.750 --> 04:34.750
Okay.

04:34.950 --> 04:36.950
I thought
we were gonna see you
at that school-Board hearing.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.050
Yeah.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.350
They suspended you, luke.
10 games.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.050
There's only 11 left.

04:45.550 --> 04:46.550
Not for you.

04:48.550 --> 04:49.550
Here you go!

04:51.050 --> 04:52.550
All right, jamie.
Let's get going.

04:53.050 --> 04:53.950
Okay.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.550
Bye, uncle lucas.
Cool hair.

05:00.350 --> 05:01.750
Wait for me right there,
okay?

05:03.750 --> 05:04.750
Look, luke...

05:05.450 --> 05:07.050
I know from experience

05:07.250 --> 05:08.950
Whatever answers
you're looking for...

05:09.450 --> 05:11.850
You're not gonna find them
like this -- Trust me.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.550
I know it sucks
that lindsey's dating,

05:14.750 --> 05:17.450
And it sucks that you grabbed that player,
but don't make it worse.

05:19.050 --> 05:21.150
The darkness doesn't
have any answers, luke.

05:32.550 --> 05:34.350
Okay, you silly rabbit.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.250
We're going to the beach.

05:36.650 --> 05:40.250
Yes, we are.
Just me and my funny bunny.

05:40.750 --> 05:41.550
Did you hear that?

05:41.750 --> 05:44.950
Did you hear what i called you?
Did you hear what mama --

05:51.150 --> 05:51.850
Hello?

05:52.950 --> 05:54.150
Yes, this is she.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.750
But...
there must be some mistake.

05:59.850 --> 06:01.150
She has eight days left.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.750
But she's recovering
from surgery, so...

06:08.450 --> 06:09.650
No, i understand.

06:10.950 --> 06:13.350
Okay. Bye-Bye.

06:17.150 --> 06:19.050
They want you to go home today.

06:19.950 --> 06:21.350
But that can't happen.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.350
Oh, well, well.

06:36.150 --> 06:38.350
What...what is all this

06:39.250 --> 06:40.150
Not sure.

06:41.450 --> 06:43.750
I would laugh if this whole
thing wasn't such a mess.

06:44.650 --> 06:45.550
What whole mess?

06:45.650 --> 06:48.450
You, your head --
All of it.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.350
You and i
are going for a drive.

06:52.450 --> 06:55.750
But, first, we're gonna fix
the ferret above your face.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.950
Why?
We're taking a drive

06:58.050 --> 06:59.950
Because i'm your best friend
and you need me.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.250
And we are fixing your...

07:03.350 --> 07:06.150
Very punk-Rock haircut

07:06.650 --> 07:07.750
Because i have
a 5-Year-Old son

07:07.850 --> 07:11.450
Who unfortunately wants to look
just like his uncle lucas.

07:17.850 --> 07:19.650
So,
how's the comeback going?

07:20.850 --> 07:21.950
It's not a comeback.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.150
Quentin says it is.

07:24.550 --> 07:25.750
Quentin's wrong.

07:26.250 --> 07:26.750
And, by the way,

07:26.850 --> 07:28.950
Nobody's sporting
the faux hawk anymore, dude.

07:29.350 --> 07:31.150
I'm bringing it back.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.250
So, what team do you think
you're gonna play for in the nba?

07:44.650 --> 07:46.150
Jamie, come here.

07:50.550 --> 07:52.950
I know you're
really excited about this, but...

07:53.750 --> 07:55.950
I'm probably
never gonna play in the nba.

07:56.450 --> 07:57.650
Sure, you will.

08:00.150 --> 08:01.750
Geez, kiddo.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.150
You're playing
with rolled-Up socks?

08:04.250 --> 08:05.350
What happened
to your ball?

08:05.750 --> 08:07.050
I lost it.

08:07.550 --> 08:09.250
I got to go feed chester

08:19.150 --> 08:20.550
I got to ask you
something.

08:20.650 --> 08:23.050
Did you tell peyton
that you hated her?

08:23.950 --> 08:25.950
Maybe.
I was a little wasted.

08:26.050 --> 08:28.450
Luke, you can be
such a jackass sometimes.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.650
She is in love with you.

08:30.850 --> 08:31.850
You probably broke her heart.

08:31.950 --> 08:33.950
Oh, i didn't break her heart.
You're being dramatic.

08:34.049 --> 08:36.750
<i>I'm being dramatic.
Stop here.</i>

08:37.850 --> 08:39.350
The light's green.
Just stop.

08:43.450 --> 08:43.950
All right.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.650
We're sitting at a green light.
Now what?

08:48.250 --> 08:49.050
Just wait for it.

08:49.150 --> 08:51.350
Haley, the light's green!
Wait for what?!

08:55.550 --> 08:57.450
Kind of like peyton's heart,
don't you think?

09:00.550 --> 09:03.650
I'll be right back.
You shouldn't stay here.

09:04.950 --> 09:05.550
Okay.

09:15.250 --> 09:15.950
Hey.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.650
You said
it made you feel better.

09:23.850 --> 09:25.150
It's gonna be okay.

09:38.930 --> 09:41.330
All right.
All clear, you goof.

09:43.230 --> 09:44.230
No peyton?

09:44.830 --> 09:47.130
No. You need to apologize
to her.

09:47.730 --> 09:51.230
Hey, remember all the water-Balloon battles
we used to have up here?

09:51.730 --> 09:53.530
Don't change the subject.

09:54.130 --> 09:55.530
Actually,
now that you mention it,

09:55.630 --> 09:58.430
It was junior year,
the boy-Toy auction.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.230
We had that water-Balloon
fight up here,

10:00.330 --> 10:03.730
And you saw my tattoo
of nathan's jersey number for the first time.

10:03.830 --> 10:06.130
You mean your
slutty little tramp stamp.

10:07.230 --> 10:09.630
<i>I am so barely your friend
right now.</i>

10:10.130 --> 10:10.930
Sorry.

10:11.730 --> 10:14.430
The point is,
i was so scared that night.

10:15.130 --> 10:17.230
I was falling in love
for the first time,

10:17.630 --> 10:19.430
And i was so unsure.

10:19.930 --> 10:20.830
But i did it.

10:21.630 --> 10:23.530
And while
it hasn't been easy,

10:23.830 --> 10:25.730
It has bn everything.

10:27.730 --> 10:29.630
We're not kids anymore, luke.
You know...

10:30.630 --> 10:33.730
It really hurts me
to wat what you're doing.

10:35.230 --> 10:37.130
Lindsey said no, hales

10:37.230 --> 10:38.330
I said yes.

10:38.630 --> 10:39.830
Don't give me that, luke.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.330
I'm being honest with you
right now,

10:41.430 --> 10:43.130
And you need to be honest
with yourself.

10:43.630 --> 10:45.030
What do you want?

10:45.130 --> 10:46.830
If lindsey's the girl
that you're in love with, great.

10:46.930 --> 10:47.930
If it's peyton, great.

10:48.030 --> 10:49.930
If it's brooke, just please...

10:50.430 --> 10:52.230
Stop hiding your heart.

10:54.530 --> 10:55.430
I mean it.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.030
Hi. How's your day?

11:06.330 --> 11:08.830
Well, i cleaned the bathroom,
washed the news van,

11:08.930 --> 11:10.730
Returned some shoes
for the weather lady

11:10.830 --> 11:13.030
Because apparently the straps
cut into her "cankles,"

11:13.130 --> 11:17.030
And they hired
a new sports guy -- Steve.

11:17.730 --> 11:19.230
How about
i buy you some lunch?

11:19.630 --> 11:20.230
Come on.

11:26.330 --> 11:28.130
Reverend howard carter.

11:29.330 --> 11:30.930
I did a little research.

11:32.130 --> 11:35.630
Man of faith, lived a good life.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.930
Tough run, though.

11:38.730 --> 11:40.630
Diabetes, stroke.

11:42.230 --> 11:44.630
You know, it's not
exactly benevolent of you

11:44.730 --> 11:47.630
To lie there and take a heart
that could be put to better use.

11:48.830 --> 11:51.630
In fact,
it's really quite selfish.

11:52.730 --> 11:53.930
Don't you agree?

11:56.330 --> 11:57.930
"Yeah, i agree.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.130
Yes, i do."

12:02.230 --> 12:03.030
Morning.

12:03.430 --> 12:04.330
Good morning.

12:05.030 --> 12:06.830
The reverend was looking
a little uncomfortable.

12:07.230 --> 12:08.430
Would you like to give him
this pillow?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.430
Actually...

12:13.730 --> 12:15.030
I just might.

12:18.830 --> 12:20.330
Hey, look.

12:20.530 --> 12:22.530
It's my mom
doing the walk of shame.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.430
<i>Maybe we should hire
a nanny for you.</i>

12:28.730 --> 12:30.330
Out with a guy
you met on a porn site.

12:30.430 --> 12:32.830
Not porn -- Erotica.

12:53.030 --> 12:54.830
Hey, buddy. Thought you
might want to go for a swim.

12:54.930 --> 12:56.530
No, thanks.

12:56.630 --> 12:57.430
It's been a while.

12:57.530 --> 12:59.630
I don't think i've seen you in the pool
since your accident.

13:00.130 --> 13:02.130
It's okay.
I have to feed chester.

13:03.530 --> 13:06.030
Jamie, are you afraid?

13:06.430 --> 13:08.130
No.
I just don't want to.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.030
Are you sure?
It might be fun.

13:11.030 --> 13:12.030
No, thank you.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.030
Well,
i think i found the problem.

13:31.830 --> 13:32.430
Brooke: you did?

13:32.630 --> 13:34.830
Yes. Uh, you have
an incredibly cute baby here,

13:34.930 --> 13:36.330
And you don't
want to send her home.

13:36.730 --> 13:38.130
But are you sure
she's well enough?

13:38.430 --> 13:41.030
Brooke, angie's tough days
are over, okay?

13:41.130 --> 13:42.630
And she was very brave
about them.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.530
It's time
for you to be brave.

13:45.730 --> 13:48.030
But i was supposed to have
eight more days with her.

13:49.030 --> 13:50.730
We were supposed to go
to the beach.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.630
Well, that's
how the program works.

13:52.730 --> 13:54.230
They take
the first flight available.

13:57.030 --> 13:58.430
Anyway, look, um...

13:59.330 --> 14:01.330
When the silence sets in...

14:01.730 --> 14:02.630
And it will --

14:02.930 --> 14:04.130
Be proud of this.

14:04.930 --> 14:06.930
Okay? You've done
a great thing here, brooke.

14:07.630 --> 14:09.930
But it's time for angie
to go home...

14:10.430 --> 14:11.430
Today.

14:15.530 --> 14:16.330
Yeah.

14:19.330 --> 14:20.430
So you got something for me, man?

14:20.630 --> 14:22.130
Just shut up
and check the ball, "q."

14:27.530 --> 14:28.430
Oh.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.230
Crossover's
a little rusty, son.

14:34.130 --> 14:36.230
Huh? Fake this guy.
Ha ha ha.

14:36.730 --> 14:38.730
Where that a.C.C. Game at,
nate? Hmm?

14:39.030 --> 14:40.330
First-Team
all-American?

14:40.830 --> 14:42.230
Nba lottery? Huh?

14:43.130 --> 14:44.330
Ugh,
up out of here, man.

14:45.430 --> 14:46.330
Damn it!

14:46.430 --> 14:49.930
The fadeaway, nate?
Really? Are you serious?

14:50.130 --> 14:52.630
The fadeaway is weak,
man! Weak!

14:55.330 --> 14:56.130
Come on, man.
Let's go again.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.330
No, man. I'm not feeling today.
I'm done.

15:02.730 --> 15:03.530
Hey, j. Scott...

15:05.930 --> 15:07.630
Why don't you run out in the hallway
and get us some waters?

15:09.030 --> 15:10.030
Okay.

15:10.230 --> 15:10.830
Hey.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.130
You see any hot
psycho nannies out there,

15:14.230 --> 15:15.630
You run back in here,
okay?

15:15.930 --> 15:16.930
Not funny.

15:21.730 --> 15:22.630
What's going on, nate?

15:25.830 --> 15:26.730
I'm just out of shape.

15:26.830 --> 15:29.130
<i>No, man. That ain't it.
That is not it.</i>

15:29.730 --> 15:31.830
Now, every day we do this,
and every day you play soft.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.230
Well, maybe that's because
i can't do this anymore.

15:34.330 --> 15:37.730
Really? Maybe you
just scared to, right? Huh?

15:37.930 --> 15:40.030
Easier to have your dream
taken away than give it a shot and fail, right?

15:40.130 --> 15:40.930
I'm not scared.
Right?

15:41.030 --> 15:42.730
You not scared?
Well, you playing scared.
I'm not scared.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.330
<i>You playing scared!
I am not scared, man!</i>

16:10.130 --> 16:13.730
I'm -- I'm afraid to go
in the pool, daddy.

16:20.030 --> 16:21.230
Yeah, but, uh...

16:22.330 --> 16:23.530
You went in the pool
all the time

16:23.630 --> 16:26.430
Before your accident, jamie,
and you loved it.

16:27.730 --> 16:29.030
You know
you can still do it.

16:30.030 --> 16:33.530
I know.
I'm just...scared.

16:41.230 --> 16:43.730
It's okay
if you don't play anymore.

16:47.830 --> 16:48.930
Thanks, son.

16:59.930 --> 17:01.130
Haley:
i'm dying here.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.329
You okay?
Huh? Yeah.

17:04.430 --> 17:07.530
Uh, i-I just got
a weird e-Mail from mia

17:07.630 --> 17:09.829
Saying she met
this guy out on tour that

17:09.930 --> 17:12.530
Said he knew ellie. So it just caught me
off guard.

17:14.430 --> 17:15.530
How come you're dying?

17:16.030 --> 17:18.030
Oh, because i'm having trouble
writing lyrics

17:18.130 --> 17:19.430
For this melody
that you liked.

17:19.530 --> 17:20.930
Okay, what do you got
so far?

17:21.030 --> 17:23.030
So far i've got nothing.

17:23.730 --> 17:24.430
All right.

17:24.930 --> 17:26.230
How about...

17:26.630 --> 17:28.030
"I hate you, bitch.
You ruined my life"?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.530
Does that
do anything for you?

17:30.330 --> 17:31.030
You know what?

17:31.230 --> 17:34.430
I do have some words for you,
even though they're not mine.

17:35.030 --> 17:37.430
Lucas and i, we used to write
our predictions every year

17:37.530 --> 17:39.430
Before the school year
started.

17:39.930 --> 17:42.630
Sort of what we hoped
would happen.
Lame.

17:42.830 --> 17:45.130
You know
you're jealous.
Kind of.

17:45.430 --> 17:48.430
Anyway, i'm gonna violate
my friendship rule here

17:48.530 --> 17:50.130
Because you're at,
like, code red.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.430
"Peyton sawyer
will become peyton scott."

17:54.530 --> 17:55.730
That was, like,
eighth grade.

17:57.030 --> 17:59.330
He got a little cocky
sophomore year.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.630
"Make out with peyton sawyer
or more."

18:03.730 --> 18:06.130
And, "this year,
i'll talk to peyton sawyer."

18:06.830 --> 18:09.030
"Try again with brooke --
Brooke davis."

18:09.130 --> 18:09.930
Well, that...

18:10.330 --> 18:12.130
But, you know, this is
how much he doesn't hate you.

18:12.230 --> 18:14.530
It's a whole lifetime's
worth.
I know. I know.

18:14.630 --> 18:15.730
That's --
That's what he writes.

18:15.830 --> 18:18.430
But what he says
is a totally different story.

18:19.430 --> 18:22.030
Sometimes people write
the things that they can't say.

18:28.630 --> 18:30.330
Come on in.
It's open.

18:35.530 --> 18:36.230
Hi.

18:38.830 --> 18:39.430
Hi.

18:47.350 --> 18:48.650
This is nice, luke.

18:49.050 --> 18:50.350
Lindsey,
what are you doing here?

18:51.550 --> 18:52.250
Uh...

18:53.150 --> 18:55.750
I needed to talk to you
about something, but...

18:56.650 --> 18:58.250
You wouldn't answer
your phone.

19:00.050 --> 19:01.150
You look good.

19:03.550 --> 19:04.650
You look hung over.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.950
Yeah, well...

19:07.750 --> 19:10.650
There's a girl i almost married
started dating again.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.050
And after that, well,
things just kind of went dark.

19:17.550 --> 19:18.450
The book's done.

19:19.850 --> 19:22.650
Oh, come on.
The -- The ending needs work.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.650
I haven't even written
a dedication yet.

19:24.850 --> 19:26.750
You can e-Mail
the dedication.

19:33.450 --> 19:35.650
The book's done, luke.

19:35.850 --> 19:36.950
It's perfect.

19:42.850 --> 19:43.550
So...

19:45.750 --> 19:47.450
I think this is goodbye.

19:49.350 --> 19:51.650
And goodbye shouldn't happen
over the phone.

20:02.450 --> 20:02.950
Lindsey...

20:05.550 --> 20:07.050
Do you ever miss me?

20:09.550 --> 20:10.650
I should go.

20:44.450 --> 20:45.250
What you doing, buddy?

20:45.550 --> 20:47.150
Looking at your trophies.

20:48.350 --> 20:50.350
You know, someday, you're
gonna have your own trophies.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.050
Think so?
Oh, yeah. I know so.

20:53.350 --> 20:56.450
Trophies, awards --
Maybe even a monument.

20:57.450 --> 21:00.750
And then maybe someday
you'll have a son of your own

21:00.850 --> 21:03.350
That's even greater than
any award or accomplishment.

21:04.250 --> 21:04.950
Come here.

21:11.050 --> 21:13.550
Don't be afraid
to be great, son. Okay?

21:13.650 --> 21:14.550
'Cause you are.

21:15.250 --> 21:18.050
And the world isn't strong enough
to beat james lucas scott.

21:20.050 --> 21:21.650
I promise.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.150
We love you.

21:32.650 --> 21:35.150
Hi, i'm steve,
the new sports guy.

21:35.450 --> 21:36.650
Hi, steve.

21:37.350 --> 21:38.850
That's
the better sports guy.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.550
The truth is, i'm scared, okay?

21:56.250 --> 21:57.550
The countdown's on.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.350
And i've got to wait for this damn beeper to go off
before i can get a heart...

22:02.550 --> 22:03.950
<i>After you get one.</i>

22:04.950 --> 22:06.350
You're the one
who's lived a good life.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.750
I'm the one who needs time
to make amends.

22:08.850 --> 22:10.650
So why don't you just take one
for the team, huh?

22:13.750 --> 22:14.850
And if you do...

22:16.650 --> 22:18.450
I'll use my time for redemption.

22:20.650 --> 22:21.550
Okay?

22:27.050 --> 22:28.250
You suck, carter.

22:46.350 --> 22:47.950
I love you, little girl,

22:48.950 --> 22:50.650
And i always will, okay?

22:51.850 --> 22:53.650
You're gonna have
a great life.

22:59.350 --> 23:00.750
Don't forget me, okay?

23:15.650 --> 23:17.350
I'm james lucas scott!

23:51.450 --> 23:52.650
You got my message.

23:54.150 --> 23:55.350
I told you not to come.

23:56.150 --> 23:57.050
I know.

23:58.750 --> 23:59.950
She's gone, luke.

24:01.650 --> 24:02.450
I know.

24:53.850 --> 24:56.150
You did it, buddy.
I knew you could. Come here.

24:57.650 --> 24:59.050
All right, you ready?
Yeah!

24:59.150 --> 24:59.950
One...

25:00.050 --> 25:01.750
Both:
two, three.

25:23.850 --> 25:24.950
Okay, carter...

25:27.950 --> 25:28.850
It's up to you.

25:31.550 --> 25:34.350
But sometimes a guy just needs a
sign there's some hope for him,

25:34.750 --> 25:35.450
You know?

25:43.250 --> 25:44.250
Hope.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.500
???

26:01.600 --> 26:03.500
And telling the new sports guy off.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.200
But i should pbably
get back to being shunned.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.800
I'm sorry
it's so hard for you now.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.400
You know something?
I stand by what i did.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.600
Luke was really hurting,

26:14.700 --> 26:18.400
And it just felt insidious
somehow to broadcast that pain.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.600
Mouth, how many men's basketball
championships has ucla --

26:21.700 --> 26:22.700
11.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.500
I don't know
what to do now.

26:28.000 --> 26:28.900
Omaha.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.700
Not without you.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.500
Then i'll go, too.

26:34.700 --> 26:37.500
Really?
U'd go with me?

26:37.700 --> 26:38.700
Yes.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.500
I'd go anywhere with you,
marvin mcfadden.

27:24.900 --> 27:27.400
Jamie, you're tracking water
all over the house!

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
I can't get him
out of that pool now.

27:31.100 --> 27:33.000
Dude, dry off
and get your jersey on.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.000
We're going
back to the gym.
We are?!

27:35.400 --> 27:38.500
Yeah.
Nathan and jamie scott.

27:40.900 --> 27:41.800
Oh, jamie!

27:49.000 --> 27:49.900
You know what?

27:51.900 --> 27:53.500
You still make
my heart race.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.700
You do. I'm serious.
Feel this.

27:58.300 --> 28:01.200
????And love and joy right now

28:01.300 --> 28:02.300
Because of you.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.700
It's my other boy.

28:08.100 --> 28:10.700
All right. I'll see you.
I love you.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.500
Hey.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.500
Wow. Very peyton.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.900
Lindsey
stopped by today.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.400
She's here?

28:24.500 --> 28:26.100
Uh, not anymore.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.400
I had to go see brooke.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.600
The trifecta.
How nice.

28:34.700 --> 28:35.700
What did lindsey want?

28:37.100 --> 28:38.900
She wanted to tell me
that my book's done.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.600
Well, everything
except the dedication.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.400
She said i could
e-Mail that to her.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.300
I'm thinking about...

28:51.200 --> 28:53.600
Taking off for a little while,
you know?

28:56.800 --> 28:58.700
Lucas,
please stop running.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.700
Come on --
You got to let go of this dark weight you're carrying around.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.200
This morning...

29:08.800 --> 29:11.700
Nathan told me the darkness
doesn't have any answers.

29:12.200 --> 29:12.900
He's right.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.500
You saw him
after his accident.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.200
And look at him now.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.100
Yeah.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.300
You know
that romantic notion

29:24.400 --> 29:26.300
That all the garbage
and the pain

29:26.400 --> 29:29.400
Is actually really healing
and beautiful

29:29.500 --> 29:30.700
And sort of poetic?

29:32.400 --> 29:33.800
It's not.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.500
It's just garbage,
and it's pain.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.500
You know what's better?

29:41.900 --> 29:43.000
Love.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.600
The day that you start thinking
that love is overrated

29:48.100 --> 29:49.700
Is the day that you are wrong

29:55.800 --> 29:57.300
The only thing wrong

29:57.800 --> 29:59.900
With love and faith
and belief...

30:01.200 --> 30:03.100
Is not having it.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.800
Woman: hey, they want to do
a conference call about the lucas scott galleys.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.500
Okay, just, uh,
have them call my cell.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.700
And then you should
take off. Thanks.

30:15.100 --> 30:16.600
Hey, lindsey,
did you tell him?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.600
No. Bye.

30:25.200 --> 30:30.100
???

30:43.600 --> 30:44.600
Hi, luke.

30:44.800 --> 30:48.100
Just got
your dedication...and...

30:50.100 --> 30:53.200
I guess i'm one
of those lost souls because...

30:54.600 --> 30:55.600
I lied to you.

30:57.700 --> 31:00.300
I said i was seeing someone,
and i wasn't.

31:02.800 --> 31:03.900
The truth is...

31:05.600 --> 31:09.600
I was afraid of the immensity
of your love, and i thought...

31:12.700 --> 31:14.200
Well, i just wanted you to know.

31:19.700 --> 31:21.900
You asked me if i miss you.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.000
Of course i miss you.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.100
That's all i do.

31:53.550 --> 31:54.850
Hi.
Hi

31:55.850 --> 31:58.050
They're supposed to call me
as soon as angie's home safe.

31:58.550 --> 31:59.550
Where's peyton?

32:00.850 --> 32:02.550
I don't know.
Probably at work.

32:03.250 --> 32:05.450
I didn't tell her
angie was leaving for sure.

32:05.950 --> 32:08.450
And you told me not to come
to the airport. Why?

32:09.850 --> 32:12.050
I don't like you guys
to see me like this --

32:13.750 --> 32:14.550
Vulnerable.

32:15.950 --> 32:17.550
That's how i always see you,
brooke.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.550
And i think
it's kind of beautiful.

32:23.950 --> 32:25.050
You know, um...

32:26.050 --> 32:28.750
I've been thinking about
all the things you've done for...

32:28.850 --> 32:31.250
Angie and rachel
and me and...

32:31.950 --> 32:33.350
All kinds of people.

32:35.050 --> 32:36.850
You save people,
brooke davis.

32:37.850 --> 32:38.850
It's what you do.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.750
Thanks for letting me
share that.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.550
You call me
when she's home safe, okay?

32:52.750 --> 32:53.850
Hey, luke.

32:57.350 --> 32:59.450
We've been through a lot --
Me and you.

33:01.750 --> 33:03.050
I wouldn't have made it
through today

33:03.150 --> 33:05.050
Or a couple other days
without you.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.350
So, thanks.

33:06.950 --> 33:07.850
You're welcome.

33:13.950 --> 33:14.950
This is for you.

33:21.450 --> 33:23.250
I love you, lucas scott.
You know that?

33:25.950 --> 33:27.450
I love you, too,
brooke davis.

33:30.150 --> 33:31.750
Okay, come on, guys!
Let's go! Let's go!

33:31.850 --> 33:34.150
Come on, come on, come on!
Rick, where are your pants?!

33:34.250 --> 33:36.050
Coffee accident.
Well, we can get them
at the break.

33:36.150 --> 33:38.050
Jerry, we're gonna lead
with the ucla signing.

33:38.150 --> 33:38.650
Where is it?
Right here.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.050
All right.
Let's get it done.

33:41.450 --> 33:42.250
You're all set.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.050
I'm good.
I got the prompter.

33:44.150 --> 33:44.850
Uh, you sure?

33:45.150 --> 33:46.850
Watch and be amazed.

33:46.950 --> 33:48.650
Okay, guys.
Countdown begins.

33:48.950 --> 33:53.350
In 5, 4, 3, 2...

33:53.650 --> 33:54.650
Cue music.

33:54.850 --> 33:55.850
Go, camera one.

33:56.250 --> 33:59.450
Graphic out.
And cue anchor.

34:00.050 --> 34:01.350
Good evening.
I'm rick hunter.

34:01.450 --> 34:04.050
And this is
the channel 11 evening news.

34:04.250 --> 34:08.650
It's national letter of intent day
for big-Time college basketball programs.

34:08.750 --> 34:13.150
Aneve gold is here with news
of a local signing. Steve.

34:13.350 --> 34:15.449
That's right, rick,
big news out of masonboro,

34:15.550 --> 34:17.550
Where local phenom shane dorset

34:17.650 --> 34:21.350
Has committed????On the west coast at ucla.

34:21.550 --> 34:24.449
Could have been you.
Obviously the local poweouses are disappointed,
