WEBVTT

01:22.332 --> 01:24.500
Kids, time to go!

01:24.585 --> 01:26.419
Coming, Carla.

01:36.013 --> 01:38.473
And I said l liked her name.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.225
Cocoa's a nice name. Isn't it?

01:41.310 --> 01:42.810
Yes. It is.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.022
Come on, Bobby. Let's go.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.655
All right. Let's go.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.120
Good morning.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.789
- Peggy.
- Good morning, Don.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.207
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.333
Hollis.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.005
You hear about Marilyn? Poor thing.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.674
It's very upsetting.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.218
I can't say I'm surprised.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.887
The few things l know about her.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.139
You just don't imagine her
ever being alone.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.557
She was so famous.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.143
Some people just hide in plain sight.

02:25.938 --> 02:29.732
My mother and sister keep calling.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.568
Suicide is disturbing.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.321
I keep thinking about Joe DiMaggio.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.288
We're lucky Playtex didn't go
for that Jackie/Marilyn campaign.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.415
We'd have to pull everything indefinitely.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.000
Yes, that's true.

02:57.219 --> 03:01.013
I've never taken pills,
even when I had a headache.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.188
Mr. Draper, good morning.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.439
Would you like coffee?

03:10.524 --> 03:11.732
I already had some.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.485
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

03:14.570 --> 03:15.778
Do you need to go home?

03:15.863 --> 03:18.281
No. Of course not.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.372
I have Warren, and I have Todd.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.541
Todd is a mail boy.
Why do you have him?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.084
I'm paying him.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.253
I'm sorry.
I don't understand this stupid blood drive.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.130
You just hate that Media wins every year.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.549
Wins what? How do you win a blood drive?
What do you win?

03:36.633 --> 03:39.635
I don't know.
You're the best or something.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.929
I'll be lucky if Accounts
can get eight people.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.472
Well, Campbell's afraid of needles,

03:43.557 --> 03:44.807
Duck doesn't give two craps.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.726
Good morning.

03:46.810 --> 03:47.977
Good morning, fellas.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.520
Is this program already in progress?

03:49.605 --> 03:52.064
We're expecting our most
successful blood drive ever.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.358
Yes. Tell me everything.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.027
I think we're very organized.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.653
Creative, our department,

03:57.738 --> 04:00.573
will be at 75 to 80%¤ participation.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.491
Of course, I'm assuming you are in.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.701
I am.

04:03.785 --> 04:07.121
Do Kurt and Smitty count as one person?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.998
Why don't you bore me with the details?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.167
We're gonna take the lockers
out of the break room,

04:11.251 --> 04:12.668
put 'em in the hallway in the morning.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.670
There will be two litters, three nurses,

04:14.755 --> 04:16.964
at least one old lady serving refreshments,
and plenty of chairs.

04:17.049 --> 04:19.675
Kinsey, I want you to pull
every intern and lackey--

04:19.760 --> 04:21.636
switchboard, elevator men.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.638
Find out who wants to be
a copywriter for the day.

04:23.722 --> 04:24.722
Dollar a head.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.890
That's not fair.

04:25.974 --> 04:29.268
You're in Accounts.
You should have thought of it.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.728
Just to be clear,

04:30.812 --> 04:34.690
do l get the dollar for each person I get,

04:34.775 --> 04:36.275
or do they get it for giving blood?

04:36.360 --> 04:37.777
The people giving blood.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.904
This is for mankind, Kinsey.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.740
That's the money they'd make
actually being in the art department.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.241
So what is the prize?

04:44.326 --> 04:45.993
Helping another human being.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.995
Also, there will be women fainting.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.580
I'd think you'd like that.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.708
If this was a flat-out athletic competition,

04:52.793 --> 04:54.919
Accounts would win,
without a doubt.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.420
What an elegant surrender.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.880
And put up more posters.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.632
I can't believe I have to say that
to you people.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.509
Apparently, if we get 100%¤ participation,

05:01.593 --> 05:03.094
which Media will do its best to aid,

05:03.178 --> 05:04.762
they're going to put us in the Times.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.263
I booked a photographer, just in case.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.765
Good.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.934
NBC's having the Mitch Miller
concert on Thursday.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.186
Any chance I could show
you and Mrs. Draper off?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.354
We'd love to, but--

05:14.690 --> 05:16.232
...my kid is sick.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.150
You'll know what that means soon enough.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.570
Shot down.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.709
That was quick.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.754
What do we have today?

06:19.838 --> 06:24.008
The 1 0:00 with Miss Holloway
to go over traffic for new business,

06:24.092 --> 06:26.719
4:00 with Ron Venincasa
from Ace Hardware,

06:26.803 --> 06:30.014
and Mr. Sterling moved the meeting
with Boston Edison to 5.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.475
I assume to have it bleed
into the cocktail hour.

06:34.853 --> 06:35.895
May I?

06:44.654 --> 06:47.239
There was a bit of confusion last night.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.366
I think I made a terrible mistake.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.327
What happened?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.953
Your daughter called and asked

06:53.038 --> 06:54.830
when you would be back
from your business trip

06:54.915 --> 06:57.249
because her mother wasn't sure.

07:01.254 --> 07:05.049
You don't have to tell me anything,
but I didn't know what to say.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.886
I said Wednesday.
I know I should have said I don't know.

07:08.970 --> 07:12.223
Mrs. Draper is working out some things.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.058
I understand.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.851
I'm sure it won't come up again.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.104
I thought it would be over by now,

07:18.188 --> 07:20.147
I guess, and there'd be no need to--

07:22.067 --> 07:23.234
I'm sorry about that.

07:23.318 --> 07:27.071
It goes without saying that this is personal,

07:27.155 --> 07:29.115
and l'd appreciate your keeping it that way.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.908
Of course.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.161
I'd also avoid giving me concerned looks.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.414
Mr. Draper, I hope you've noticed
I'm a discreet person.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.707
I don't know you at all,

07:38.792 --> 07:39.917
and this is personal,

07:40.001 --> 07:41.502
and it's not up for discussion.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.714
Of course.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.925
If you need anything,
I'm right out there.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.266
I'm at the Roosevelt
if there's an emergency.

08:15.579 --> 08:18.247
In an interview just weeks before her death,

08:18.331 --> 08:20.833
Miss Monroe angrily protested to a reporter

08:20.917 --> 08:22.751
about attacks on stars.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.421
"We're what's okay with
the movie business," she said.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.840
"Management is what's
wrong with the business."

08:50.071 --> 08:53.157
Mr. Campbell, Miss Olson,
and Mr. Romano are here.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.658
Send them in.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.539
My oldest just turned 30,

09:00.624 --> 09:02.374
and she's had a string of bad beaux.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.335
It's very upsetting.

09:04.419 --> 09:05.878
Can I get you kids anything?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.588
- I'm fine.
- I'll have something.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.548
They're probably walking over.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.050
Dress rehearsal, Freddie.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.844
I'll do introductions.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.512
Jeff Hartung's wife just had a baby.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.348
Boy or girl?

09:17.432 --> 09:19.183
That's good.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.851
Then I talk about Volkswagen.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.020
No. Don said we only
bring up Volkswagen

09:23.104 --> 09:24.563
if they don't like what we've presented.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.148
Okay. Then I throw it to you, Freddie.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.608
Thank you, Freddie.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.906
"I just got a brand-new
Samsonite Silhouette,

09:33.990 --> 09:35.115
"and I hate it.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.325
"Don't get me wrong.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.327
"I love the shape, the size, the color,

09:38.411 --> 09:41.163
"and I love the Silhouette
because it's a Samsonite,

09:41.248 --> 09:43.707
so I know we're gonna go
lots of places together,"

09:43.792 --> 09:45.376
see lots of things,

09:45.460 --> 09:47.628
collect a lifetime of memories.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.714
I hate my Silhouette because it's empty.

09:50.799 --> 09:51.966
Then Sal.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.220
Shouldn't the artwork come first?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.264
What about unveiling it?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.057
You know how excited they get.

10:03.645 --> 10:04.645
Freddie?

10:09.651 --> 10:11.277
What the hell, Freddie?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.736
What--

10:12.821 --> 10:14.446
What were we talking about?

10:14.531 --> 10:16.240
Two types of travelers.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.953
Freddie, do you have
another pair of trousers here?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.998
Why?

10:24.082 --> 10:29.628
Jesus.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.049
I'll fix this.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.844
I'm gonna-- I need a minute.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.347
I gotta think.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.398
Freddie?

10:54.404 --> 10:55.529
Is he dead?

10:56.781 --> 10:59.450
No, he's not dead. He passed out.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.244
He's fine.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.997
The Hartungs are at reception.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.376
We'll be right there. Thanks, Abigail.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.504
He can't leave this room.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.507
They're all from Colorado.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.385
I guess I could push it until tomorrow,

11:18.470 --> 11:21.305
book them another night at the Carlyle.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.806
Should I just cancel it?

11:22.891 --> 11:24.308
I should talk to Don.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.517
That's not necessary.
I can handle this.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.769
Fine.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.104
Jesus. It's a suitcase.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.357
Peggy, you can do it, right?

11:31.441 --> 11:33.108
You think it's gonna be better tomorrow?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.651
Shit.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.362
It'll be fine.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.323
We'll tell them Freddie's sick. lt's true.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.117
I'll go to reception.
You two go to the conference room

11:42.202 --> 11:44.370
and act like you've been waiting,
but don't look mad.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.163
Someone tell Freddie's girl it's cancelled.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.831
I don't want him wandering in.

11:50.877 --> 11:51.835
It's disgusting.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.837
There's no need for that.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.106
Can I speak to you for a minute?

12:24.828 --> 12:26.578
Carla?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.816
I forgot you were coming by.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.317
Are you okay?

12:59.487 --> 13:01.572
I haven't been feeling well.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.198
Oh, no, Betty.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.242
You and Don are still
coming tonight, I hope.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.743
We'd love to.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.704
I just don't think I'll be up to it.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.164
That ruins things.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.917
Well, you wanted to borrow
the black chiffon, right?

13:14.002 --> 13:15.002
Come upstairs.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.211
Are you sure?

13:16.296 --> 13:17.421
I don't know who l'm gonna talk to.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.006
Raymond has to work these things.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.555
And I got you out of bed?
I am so sorry.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.432
Give me the black one, and I'll go.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.516
Nonsense.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.899
I think my waist is higher than yours.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.776
What do you have that's generous?

13:39.861 --> 13:41.236
I don't know.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.532
How about this?

13:45.617 --> 13:48.160
You'll look like sherbet.
Long white gloves.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.579
I can't wear those after Gypsy.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.707
Think you'll be better
by lunch on Thursday?

13:55.460 --> 13:57.669
I'm looking forward to it.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.048
This is youthful.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.178
It doesn't matter. I'm invisible.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.765
That's not true.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.936
Raymond's sweet about it,
but he's so easy to please.

14:15.730 --> 14:16.813
That's sweet.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.649
It is.

14:18.733 --> 14:23.278
I think, what did I do to deserve him?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.405
Then I spend his money on Dr. Weinberg.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.658
I got my diagnosis the other day.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.034
I'm bored.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.828
That's too bad.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.498
I saw Arthur have a fight with Tara,

14:34.582 --> 14:38.168
and I have been having
ridiculous dreams since.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.920
I wish you'd come ride with us again.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.380
It really takes the pressure off.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.383
Think you can carry this?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.010
No, ma'am.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.722
You shouldn't talk to him so much.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.558
I know. It's embarrassing.

14:55.937 --> 14:59.022
It's a switch you can flip
on and off, you know.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.566
Really?

15:02.068 --> 15:04.194
You don't even think about this, do you?

15:05.613 --> 15:07.114
Don's perfect.

15:13.663 --> 15:14.871
Can we talk at lunch?

15:14.956 --> 15:16.832
I'm really not feeling well.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.167
Take them all.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.795
No. Just these two.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.627
That's it for today.

16:25.068 --> 16:28.403
Many's the time I've dreamed
of finding you like this.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.280
What are you doing here?

16:30.365 --> 16:32.074
You're right.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.241
I'll just get all my belongings,

16:33.326 --> 16:34.451
- and l'll leave.
- It's 4:30.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.078
You're supposed to be
sitting in a bar somewhere

16:36.162 --> 16:37.621
waiting for Boston Edison.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.498
How often do you come in here?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.501
Not that often.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.716
What's wrong, Red?

16:49.801 --> 16:51.009
Do you miss me?

16:53.638 --> 16:55.222
She was so young.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.767
Not you, too.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.312
Yes, I'm just another frivolous secretary.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.772
It's a terrible tragedy,

17:03.856 --> 17:06.566
but that woman's a stranger.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.318
Roosevelt--

17:08.403 --> 17:10.320
I hated him, but I felt like I knew him.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.656
A lot of people felt like they knew her.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.324
You should be sensitive to that.

17:14.409 --> 17:17.411
Hey. You're not like her.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.790
Physically, a little,

17:21.874 --> 17:23.750
but don't tell me that makes you sad.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.335
It's not a joke.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.379
This world destroyed her.

17:27.463 --> 17:31.967
Really? She was a movie star
who had everything and everybody,

17:32.051 --> 17:33.719
and she threw it away.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.558
But, hey, if you want to be sad.

17:39.642 --> 17:43.687
One day you'll lose someone
who's important to you.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.480
You'll see.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.607
It's very painful.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.543
Are you feeling better, Mommy?

18:06.627 --> 18:09.588
Yes. I'll join you next time.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.009
I'm surprised Daddy let you in the car.

18:16.387 --> 18:17.888
You kids should go to bed.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.557
Wash your face and brush your teeth.
I'll tuck you in.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.311
Good night.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.398
You just came back.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.902
Now you're leaving again?

18:31.986 --> 18:34.946
It'll go by like that.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.157
Come here.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.001
It won't be that long, Salamander.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.670
Go.

18:57.595 --> 19:00.263
Listen, she called my office.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.892
She did? When?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.102
Monday.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.896
What do you want me to say?

19:07.980 --> 19:10.440
I think she expected you
over the weekend.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.611
You said you didn't want me here,
and then you do.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.071
I didn't want them involved in this.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.281
Obviously, that's impossible.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.576
What do you want to do?

19:21.661 --> 19:24.621
I mean, how long is this going to go on?

19:24.705 --> 19:26.081
We have to tell them something.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.165
Like what?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.295
Okay. How about...

19:32.380 --> 19:33.588
I'm working on an account.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.006
They're putting me up in Philadelphia,

19:35.091 --> 19:36.675
but l'll be home every weekend.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.677
Jesus. Did you just think that up?

19:38.761 --> 19:41.263
Or I could just come home.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.477
Bets, what do you want?

19:51.858 --> 19:52.983
Listen, if your mind's made up,

19:53.067 --> 19:54.484
I'm not gonna talk you into it.

19:54.569 --> 19:57.070
I thought you can talk
anyone into anything.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.201
Good night.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.219
Would you like coffee?

20:21.304 --> 20:22.596
And a bear claw.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.686
What's this?

20:29.770 --> 20:32.981
I thought you could use
a few more shirts in your rotation.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.696
Thank you. Submit your receipt.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.699
Your correspondence is on your desk.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.327
Let me get you breakfast.
l'll be right back.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.246
And Mr. Kinsey said
that I have to drag you,

20:48.331 --> 20:49.915
if necessary, to the blood drive.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.752
You're not a fainter, are you?

20:55.171 --> 20:57.881
I don't faint, but I might cry after.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.397
Peggy.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.482
Hello, Freddie.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.733
How'd it go yesterday?

21:16.817 --> 21:18.610
I left word with Abigail. They loved it.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.236
Good. Good.

21:20.321 --> 21:23.365
I was thinking about
letting you talk anyway.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.371
I have to apologize
for putting you in that spot.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.956
Freddie, it's over.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.624
There's no reason to talk about it.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.918
Of course.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.836
Did they ask about me?

21:36.921 --> 21:38.254
We told them you were sick.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.757
That's good.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.301
So on Monday,
when they get back to Colorado,

21:43.386 --> 21:45.470
I'll give them a call and sew things up.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.013
That's a great idea.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.291
Bobby.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.169
Mrs. Draper. I'm sorry to bother you.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.921
It's okay, Carla.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.591
It's a beautiful day.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.386
I'm going to take the children out again.
Is that good?

22:27.555 --> 22:29.180
Whatever they want.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.601
Can I do anything for you?

22:33.686 --> 22:35.311
If you want, I can draw a bath.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.355
No, thank you.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.156
I've been married
almost 20 years, you know.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.701
I really don't want to talk about this.

22:49.785 --> 22:53.913
I'm sorry.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.500
Carla....

22:57.585 --> 23:01.337
I haven't been sleeping very well.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.131
You know what helps?

23:03.215 --> 23:05.341
Splash cold water
on your face and go outside.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.844
You'll notice things
are right where you left them.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.238
I'm usually part of the meeting
before the meeting.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.115
Relax, Don. Sit down.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.659
This is all being done in the right way.

23:35.623 --> 23:36.790
Campbell.

23:39.251 --> 23:42.504
Well, Don, I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.548
We were on the launch pad
yesterday for Samsonite,

23:45.633 --> 23:47.967
and Freddie Rumsen pissed his pants.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.345
What?

23:50.429 --> 23:51.721
He's not talking about nerves here.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.224
He's talking about a wet pair of pants.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.185
Really?

23:57.269 --> 23:59.229
How'd the presentation go?

23:59.313 --> 24:01.523
Don, it's conduct unbefitting.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.108
Of Freddie Rumsen?

24:03.192 --> 24:05.068
We're lucky Campbell here
grabbed the controls.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.278
He locked Rumsen up
and threw Peggy Olson in.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.863
We're lucky the bench is deep.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.741
We have to cut him loose.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.827
Is that necessary?

24:13.911 --> 24:15.370
The man is a train wreck.

24:16.831 --> 24:18.581
We at least need to get him
off this account.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.291
They called already.
They're thrilled with Peggy.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.418
No. I don't want him
on any of my accounts.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.087
This could have happened in a meeting.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.089
But it didn't.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.885
That'll be all, boys.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.054
Thank you for bringing this
to our attention.

24:36.517 --> 24:39.144
We're not doing him any favors
keeping him around.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.566
Duck's a teetotaler.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.192
He's been gunning
for Freddie since day 1 .

24:46.277 --> 24:47.652
He's got a point.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.112
We can't even tell Cooper about this.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.739
You know his whole thing with germs.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.283
I don't think it's in my contract

24:53.367 --> 24:55.118
that Duck can fire someone
in my department.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.452
You don't have a contract.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.205
And I can fire anyone I want to.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.457
We really don't have a choice.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.210
You can still get him to give blood.

25:04.295 --> 25:06.296
The agencies will laugh about this,

25:06.380 --> 25:10.091
but the clients,
they already think we're all like that.

25:12.553 --> 25:16.514
We'll say it's a six-month leave of absence
so he can go for the cure.

25:16.599 --> 25:19.475
He'll know what that means.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.227
You don't want to throw him away.

25:23.439 --> 25:26.065
Your loyalty is starting
to become a liability.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.027
Let's do this before he finds out.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.236
We don't need any more accidents.

25:30.321 --> 25:31.905
Dinner tonight.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.616
You need to call the missus?

25:34.700 --> 25:36.075
I'll make it.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.281
Mr. Case.

26:17.368 --> 26:18.451
Betty.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.661
How are you?

26:20.788 --> 26:22.789
It's a beautiful day.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.794
Have you just ridden,
or are you about to ride?

26:27.878 --> 26:29.712
I can never tell whether
you're before or after.

26:29.797 --> 26:30.880
I'm on my way out.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.174
It's good to see you.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.009
How are your children?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.302
They're wonderful.

26:39.682 --> 26:41.474
Have you seen Sara Beth lately?

26:41.558 --> 26:43.101
I think so. Monday, maybe?

26:43.185 --> 26:44.352
That's good news.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.104
I'm glad she came.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.897
Why?

26:47.982 --> 26:49.774
Nothing.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.609
I had noticed she seemed distracted.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.153
I shouldn't have said anything.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.531
Is there anything I can do?

26:56.615 --> 27:00.118
No. But she'd be glad
to know you're concerned.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.786
I think you make her feel better.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.539
She talks about you a lot.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.582
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.168
You know what?

27:09.253 --> 27:11.796
The three of us should go to lunch
and have some fun.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.214
It would cheer her up.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.924
It's a great idea.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.217
Thursday?

27:16.302 --> 27:18.303
Café Soleil in Old Town.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.387
1 :00.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.680
I'll pick up the check.

27:20.764 --> 27:21.848
See you then.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.069
That was nothing.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.946
I'm thinking of doing it again.

27:37.031 --> 27:38.781
You should smoke a cigarette right now.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.283
I know they said not to,

27:40.367 --> 27:41.951
but I'm telling you,
my knees buckled.

27:42.036 --> 27:45.079
I thought I was gonna perform
a fuIl Freddie Rumsen.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.831
Jesus.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.418
Hello, Don. We're in the lead.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.878
Turns out Hollis has a novel.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.338
Good.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.922
Too bad Freddie made
his donation yesterday.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.300
He's a real wizz in advertising.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.927
Jesus.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.429
What are you doing?

28:01.513 --> 28:02.972
What do you mean?

28:04.308 --> 28:06.142
That's none of your business.

28:07.311 --> 28:08.811
Freddie had a bad day.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.521
Can't you find something else to do

28:10.606 --> 28:13.066
besides dining on the drama
of other people's lives

28:13.150 --> 28:14.692
like a bunch of teenage girls?

28:16.320 --> 28:19.280
Sorry, Don. It's funny.

28:20.699 --> 28:21.908
Sure.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.868
It's just a man's name, right?

28:32.294 --> 28:34.337
Could you leave us alone for a moment?

28:36.423 --> 28:38.257
Truth to tell, I was a little nervous.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.426
I'd never given one of those
funny speeches before

28:40.511 --> 28:42.678
where you say what you don't mean.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.555
Freddie, we've reached a decision.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.392
You're gonna take
a six-month leave of absence.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.353
Is that necessary?

28:50.437 --> 28:52.313
The door will be open.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.357
It was a snafu.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.651
Isn't the embarrassment enough?

28:56.735 --> 28:59.112
Full salary. You dry out, come back,

28:59.196 --> 29:00.446
we'll see where we are.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.951
Clients love me. l keep up with them.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.661
We have laughs.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.246
Monday morning, I'll be good as new.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.330
I promise.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.624
There's a line, Freddie,

29:11.708 --> 29:13.334
and you wet it.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.212
You see? We're laughing about it.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.047
What's the big deal?

29:18.132 --> 29:20.842
You remember Bob Peebles?
How mean he was?

29:20.926 --> 29:23.261
He fired his secretary,

29:23.345 --> 29:25.430
and he threw all her things
out the window,

29:25.514 --> 29:26.597
including her keys.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.307
That was good for morale.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.147
What is this about?

29:34.231 --> 29:36.566
Duck Phillips?

29:36.650 --> 29:38.151
He's as dry as a bone.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.819
He doesn't understand this business.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.113
Freddie, my father would
have fired you for this.

29:42.197 --> 29:45.450
Your father drank more
than the two of you put together.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.578
He used to come in
with his shirt on inside-out.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.413
He admired you.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.207
I, however, had different
feelings at the time.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.042
When we first met,

29:55.127 --> 29:57.170
Bonny Prince Sterling here
thought I was a coward

29:57.254 --> 29:58.796
because I was in the Signal Corps.

29:58.881 --> 30:01.674
I didn't know it was only
for his last six months.

30:01.758 --> 30:02.884
I thought he was a typist.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.760
Turns out before that,

30:04.845 --> 30:06.554
he was in charge of killing people--

30:06.638 --> 30:08.055
and by people, l mean Germans.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.557
It was a long time ago.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.892
Come on. Be proud.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.393
What was it? Like 1 5 of them.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.604
That's impressive.

30:16.106 --> 30:20.401
Look, I can be completely in control.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.236
My podiatrist went to Hazleton.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.655
Came back a new man with great stories.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.282
Only drinks beer now.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.706
It's the best thing, Freddie.

30:36.585 --> 30:40.963
WeIl, l guess you get dealt
the hand you get dealt, right?

30:44.134 --> 30:45.676
I can pull myself together.

30:45.761 --> 30:48.346
I got a great book.

30:48.430 --> 30:53.392
Maybe I'll head to Philly or Boston.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.603
They're all dying to do what we do here.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.939
You know I'll recommend you.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.066
Fantastic. So this could be good.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.318
There's a lot of great towns.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.113
My father sold greeting cards.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.949
He used to come into the kitchen,

31:08.033 --> 31:09.825
unroll this map on the table,

31:09.910 --> 31:12.245
and put a finger on a spot
and say something like,

31:12.329 --> 31:15.248
"Memphis. Who wants
to live in Memphis?"

31:15.332 --> 31:16.707
I'd say, "Not me."

31:16.792 --> 31:19.001
We had only been in Springfield
for nine months.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.714
Meanwhile, here we are.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.132
To New York.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.552
Come on. Let's make a night of it.

31:29.179 --> 31:30.179
Really?

31:30.264 --> 31:31.764
Absolutely.

31:34.768 --> 31:35.977
To Monday morning.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.229
It'll be here faster than you think.

31:40.274 --> 31:41.399
Hold off on the menus.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.192
We're going to take another lap first.

31:43.277 --> 31:44.777
Bring some bread.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.243
Give me 5 bucks.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.953
No. Sorry. Don.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.834
Can I help you gentlemen?

31:59.918 --> 32:01.544
Swordfish.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.338
And who are you here to see?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.048
You can't do that now.

32:06.133 --> 32:07.592
I just gave you the money.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.802
Come on. Do we look like cops?

32:09.886 --> 32:11.596
Sir?

32:13.724 --> 32:15.308
I have a very good friend--

32:15.392 --> 32:17.059
I can't remember the guy's name.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.312
How about if l give you our names?

32:19.396 --> 32:20.563
I'm Dick Dollars,

32:20.647 --> 32:22.273
this is Mike Moneybags,

32:22.357 --> 32:23.858
and this--

32:23.942 --> 32:25.067
Tilden Katz.

32:29.489 --> 32:30.948
Fine.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.700
Here.

32:32.784 --> 32:33.826
That's a 20.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.788
Gentlemen.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.350
Is it Milwaukee?

32:57.434 --> 32:58.434
Yes, it is.

32:58.518 --> 32:59.894
Son of a bitch.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.830
The Chuck-a-luck.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.383
Going to need some cocktails.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.637
Hey, isn't that the champ back there?

33:34.721 --> 33:37.306
For another couple of months.

33:37.391 --> 33:38.391
You're crazy.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.476
Nobody's gonna beat him.

33:42.896 --> 33:44.021
Hey, loosen up.

33:44.106 --> 33:45.856
Everything's gonna be okay.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.443
Just in time.

33:49.528 --> 33:53.280
Canadian Club neat,
Wolfschmidt Gibson,

33:53.365 --> 33:54.990
Granddad rocks.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.828
Pete Campbell.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.372
I would have never thought
I was in his way.

34:05.836 --> 34:07.795
You know, you bet badly.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.046
Obviously.

34:09.131 --> 34:10.506
No. l mean you win a few times,

34:10.590 --> 34:12.174
you got to start really putting it out there.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.592
You kept betting the same thing.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.803
You're so good at this,
why don't you quit your job?

34:19.057 --> 34:21.851
See? He's having a great time.

34:25.731 --> 34:26.856
Hello, there.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.692
Are we winners or losers?

34:31.194 --> 34:34.238
Losers tonight,
but winners in general.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.616
You know, BBDO hired a colored kid.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.702
What do you think of that?

34:39.786 --> 34:41.620
I think I'm glad I'm not that kid.

34:46.626 --> 34:49.253
I'm sorry.
Can we get you a drink or something?

34:49.337 --> 34:50.379
No.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.220
I'm sorry. Were you interested?

34:58.305 --> 35:00.055
No, l'm fine. Thank you.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.391
I know what's going on.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.351
You come in too early.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.061
You got dry cleaning
moving in and out.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.772
I can't remember the last time it was

35:07.856 --> 35:09.064
you went out spur of the moment.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.567
Send off Freddie,
I had to send off Freddie.

35:11.651 --> 35:12.818
Come on.

35:12.903 --> 35:15.738
I've been in your particular situation.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.656
I heard you chaired the blood drive.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.116
Where are you, the Stanhope?

35:19.201 --> 35:20.284
The Biltmore?

35:20.368 --> 35:22.369
- Roger.
- Did she kick you out? You leave?

35:22.454 --> 35:23.579
There's nothing to talk about.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.539
Look, people make mistakes.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.750
You feel bad about it.
You think things over,

35:27.834 --> 35:31.253
and in the end,
you do the grand gesture for her.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.464
It'll be easy for you. You're creative.

35:33.548 --> 35:34.924
Roger, will you stop?

35:35.008 --> 35:37.092
All I'm gonna say is
do you want to be right,

35:37.177 --> 35:38.427
or do you want to be married?

35:38.512 --> 35:40.971
I know marriage isn't a natural state,
but you do it.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.097
Why?

35:42.182 --> 35:43.849
I don't know.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.144
The kids.

35:47.229 --> 35:48.562
Again!

35:50.190 --> 35:52.274
And don't fool yourself.
There are other things.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.193
Think about when you met her.

35:57.197 --> 35:58.781
Okay. I'm sorry.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.825
You're so secretive.

36:01.868 --> 36:02.952
Hey, Don.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.038
Look who's here.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.165
lf it isn't the man
in the gray flannel suit.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.549
What the hell was that for?

36:18.301 --> 36:19.969
We're gonna go.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.303
Don't worry about it.

36:21.388 --> 36:24.306
I'm sure it's not the first time
he's been punched in the face.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.019
Hey, Floyd.

36:30.730 --> 36:31.981
How'd I do?

36:38.446 --> 36:41.156
I'm sure there are 20 people
who want to thank you for that.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.158
It wasn't exactly a fair match-up.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.744
I think that's gonna do it for me.

36:45.829 --> 36:47.496
Yeah. Me, too.

36:47.581 --> 36:49.915
It's getting late.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.209
- This was a nice evening.
- Hold on.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.879
Don and I are going to the East Side.
You take it.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.214
Absolutely.

37:05.098 --> 37:07.391
I'd like to stay and get
all sentimental with you,

37:07.475 --> 37:11.353
but I got to go and give
a Chinaman a music lesson.

37:11.438 --> 37:14.481
Want to watch how I do it,
unzipping the fly and everything?

37:14.566 --> 37:16.233
Yeah. Go to hell.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.277
Take him to McCann.

37:24.784 --> 37:25.868
This was fun.

37:25.952 --> 37:26.952
Good.

37:27.037 --> 37:29.705
I'm gonna miss you.

37:29.789 --> 37:30.956
You're talented.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.960
I don't know.

37:35.045 --> 37:37.046
Thank you, Freddie.

37:37.130 --> 37:39.006
It means a lot.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.926
What am I gonna do?

37:42.010 --> 37:43.761
What am I going to tell Violet?

37:45.764 --> 37:48.182
I don't know.
It sounded like you had a plan.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.353
I'm not kidding, Don.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.104
What am I gonna do?

37:55.398 --> 37:57.399
It's not an ending.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.776
It's a fresh start.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.740
If I don't go into that office every day,

38:04.824 --> 38:06.325
who am I?

38:11.164 --> 38:12.998
Where do you live, Freddie?

38:14.834 --> 38:16.919
1 52 Riverside Drive.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.296
Apartment 604.

38:20.590 --> 38:24.551
No matter what he says,
take him there.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.725
Good night, Freddie.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.062
Good-bye, Don.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.164
See, I find if I stick
with the clear liquors--

38:54.249 --> 38:56.542
vodka, gin-- I know where I stand.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.712
I'm the opposite.

39:01.715 --> 39:03.382
So what do you think,
because you gave blood,

39:03.466 --> 39:05.342
the whiskey made you a little angry?

39:06.886 --> 39:09.221
That was a real
Archibald Whitman maneuver.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.431
Who's that?

39:10.515 --> 39:12.474
This hothead drunk I used to know.

39:12.559 --> 39:15.352
Jimmy Barrett's a weasel. Enjoy.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.193
So what's going on with you?

39:27.490 --> 39:28.741
I'm at the Roosevelt.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.326
See? That wasn't so hard.

39:31.411 --> 39:33.328
I really don't want to discuss it, Roger.

39:33.413 --> 39:35.998
Why? Because you feel so bad?
I've been there.

39:38.418 --> 39:41.086
No, l don't feel bad at all.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.382
I mean, sometimes.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.387
Mostly, I'm just relieved.

39:50.472 --> 39:51.597
Really?

39:53.767 --> 39:55.684
Did you fall in love?

39:57.562 --> 39:58.604
No.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.857
That'd be easier.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.484
Then I'd know what to do.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.360
Easier--

40:05.445 --> 40:07.863
There's some incredible woman,

40:07.947 --> 40:11.033
and someone's gonna end up with her,
but it can't be you.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.326
Why not?

40:14.954 --> 40:16.538
'Cause we're married.

40:25.006 --> 40:27.007
I don't know.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.217
It's your life.

40:30.053 --> 40:31.553
You don't know how long it's gonna be,

40:31.638 --> 40:33.305
but you know it's got a bad ending.

40:34.474 --> 40:36.934
You have to move forward.

40:38.812 --> 40:40.687
As soon as you can
figure out what that is.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.440
Two coronaries.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.327
Gotta move forward.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.289
It's your life.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.044
I mean, this can't be it, right?

41:07.465 --> 41:09.133
We're in it together.

41:19.519 --> 41:20.644
That's true.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.277
You wanted to see me?

41:28.361 --> 41:30.195
Close the door.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.042
That was quite a presentation you gave.

41:44.127 --> 41:46.670
The Samsonite people are thrilled.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.755
That's good to hear.

41:48.840 --> 41:53.510
They've requested that you be reassigned
as the copywriter on their account.

41:53.595 --> 41:56.346
What about Freddie?

41:56.431 --> 41:58.807
Freddie's decided
to take a few months off.

41:58.892 --> 42:01.310
He did? When's he coming back?

42:01.394 --> 42:03.145
It doesn't matter.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.647
You'll be taking over all of his business.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.485
Are you sure?

42:10.570 --> 42:12.112
You know, I really don't like

42:12.197 --> 42:15.240
walking into an ambush
from Duck and Pete Campbell.

42:15.325 --> 42:18.076
I don't know why anyone
had to know about that.

42:18.161 --> 42:20.329
Even me?

42:20.413 --> 42:21.413
No, of course you,

42:21.497 --> 42:23.081
but...

42:23.166 --> 42:24.374
I just thought that--

42:26.044 --> 42:27.502
I love Freddie.

42:27.587 --> 42:29.963
What's your point?

42:30.048 --> 42:32.799
Don't feel bad about
being good at your job.

42:35.345 --> 42:38.055
I wish it hadn't happened this way.

42:40.266 --> 42:41.934
That's the way it happened.

42:44.145 --> 42:45.604
Congratulations.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.383
- Miss Olson--
- ln a minute.

43:14.467 --> 43:16.468
You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.636
Mr. Campbell.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.805
Do you know what you did
to Freddie Rumsen?

43:19.889 --> 43:20.973
For just cause.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.391
You didn't have to tell Don.

43:22.475 --> 43:23.600
You told on Mr. Rumsen?

43:23.685 --> 43:24.810
Do you mind?

43:29.148 --> 43:30.524
It would have gotten out anyway.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.485
Right, and he'd be some legend
in one of those stupid stories.

43:33.569 --> 43:36.238
Remember the guy who wet his pants
before the big meeting?

43:36.322 --> 43:37.406
Instead, he's finished.

43:37.490 --> 43:39.157
Why do you feel bad for him?

43:39.242 --> 43:42.119
Those people always blame
their problems on society.

43:42.203 --> 43:44.746
He did it to himself.
Those people have no self-control.

43:44.831 --> 43:46.748
If it wasn't for him,
I'd still be a secretary.

43:46.833 --> 43:49.668
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be a junior copywriter.

43:51.504 --> 43:54.840
I refuse to feel bad.
We're going to get raises.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.216
You could get his office.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.804
Now, l'll go first.

44:00.888 --> 44:02.973
Congratulations, Peggy.

44:06.352 --> 44:07.811
Congratulations, Pete.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.405
Good to see you.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.782
This is me.

44:20.867 --> 44:23.118
It's nice to see you.

44:23.202 --> 44:24.619
What are you doing here?

44:24.704 --> 44:26.163
Betty invited me for lunch,

44:26.247 --> 44:28.373
but we're gonna need
another place setting.

44:31.210 --> 44:32.669
We're gonna be three.

44:36.257 --> 44:38.133
Betty didn't say you'd be joining us.

44:38.217 --> 44:40.135
I hope I'm not intruding.

44:40.219 --> 44:41.595
She thought it'd be fun.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.805
It will be.

44:43.890 --> 44:47.017
It's just gotten infinitely more fun.

44:49.145 --> 44:50.979
I think I need whatever you're having.

44:52.023 --> 44:53.732
It's a gin and tonic.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.484
Nothing special.

44:55.568 --> 44:57.152
It's perfect.

45:04.494 --> 45:05.702
Keep stirring.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.459
Bobby, go get two spoons.

45:27.975 --> 45:30.185
So with Indian Point open now,

45:30.269 --> 45:33.146
we should be able to use
even a modest safety record.

45:33.231 --> 45:35.899
We were spitballing about a cartoon turtle.

45:35.983 --> 45:40.195
Kids. Keeps it friendly and nature-loving,

45:40.279 --> 45:41.905
and then we just hammer
the Ravenswood area

45:41.989 --> 45:43.532
until they're ready for the next plant.

45:44.784 --> 45:45.992
You on board with that?

45:49.163 --> 45:50.372
Yes.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.417
I want to see schedules,

45:53.501 --> 45:55.627
and l want to see this turtle.

46:03.928 --> 46:06.304
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

46:09.434 --> 46:10.600
Hello, Don.

46:10.685 --> 46:12.686
Hello, Mona. Jane, it's okay.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.734
Just stop.

46:19.819 --> 46:20.902
What?

46:23.072 --> 46:24.531
I don't even know what to say to you.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.032
About what?

46:26.117 --> 46:28.702
Don't act innocent.

46:28.786 --> 46:31.955
He's leaving me for his secretary.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.206
Roger?

46:33.291 --> 46:36.460
He's in love,
and you said it was great.

46:36.544 --> 46:38.086
Mona, I didn't say anything.

46:38.171 --> 46:42.632
"It's your life.
You have to move forward."

46:45.303 --> 46:46.887
Mona, I didn't mean it that way.

46:46.971 --> 46:48.847
25 years of marriage.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.395
I want you to caIm down.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.814
Don't make me make a scene.

46:57.899 --> 46:59.691
We should talk about this.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.693
You can talk to Margaret.

47:25.259 --> 47:28.553
Listen, Don, l can explain.

47:28.638 --> 47:30.597
I want her off my desk.

47:36.229 --> 47:39.689
