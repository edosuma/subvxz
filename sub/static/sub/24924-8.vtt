00:06.380 --> 00:08.621
[theme music playing]

00:30.570 --> 00:33.642
[Andy] Seeing Hannah like that,
it was surreal.

00:34.610 --> 00:37.192
The only thing that can bring
a grown man to his knees.

00:37.740 --> 00:38.980
I felt privileged.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.652
Privileged that this fragile,
little thing would trust me

00:42.750 --> 00:44.820
before she knew to trust anything else.

00:45.750 --> 00:49.629
And that I'd get to spend
the rest of my life getting to know her.

00:53.590 --> 00:56.081
-I'm sorry.
-[Dennis] No. Don't be.

00:57.180 --> 00:59.637
It's perfectly fine
to be emotional up there today.

01:02.350 --> 01:03.886
-[both sniffing]
-[Olivia] God.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.265
I remember he couldn't stop crying
that day.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.396
-[Andy laughs]
-He cried more than I did.

01:11.940 --> 01:13.817
[chuckles, sniffles]

01:14.110 --> 01:17.273
You were so strong, I think the nurses
were more concerned about me.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.021
You were scared. We both were.

01:22.910 --> 01:24.446
Turns out we were right to be.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.706
[Olivia] No, no, don't do that
to yourself.

01:29.250 --> 01:32.629
Andy, you were an amazing father
from day one.

01:32.710 --> 01:35.793
[Dennis] Look, it's natural to ask
yourselves these questions.

01:36.090 --> 01:39.173
But what the jury needs to hear today
is how much you loved Hannah,

01:39.510 --> 01:42.502
and how much trust you placed
in Liberty High School to protect her.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.979
Well, there's lots of chatter online
about Hannah's tapes.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.516
People are worried
it's going to affect the trial.

01:52.610 --> 01:53.816
[Dennis] I'm not concerned.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.391
It still doesn't serve the school
to admit them into evidence

01:56.490 --> 01:57.479
any more than it does us.

01:57.570 --> 01:59.947
But couldn't it work in our favor?

02:00.280 --> 02:02.942
To have Hannah's story out there
in her own words?

02:03.030 --> 02:05.032
Or will it bias the jury against us?

02:05.120 --> 02:08.408
How? How could it do that?
To hear what happened to her.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.990
It's a complicated story, Liv.

02:13.670 --> 02:15.251
[cell phone buzzing]

02:27.140 --> 02:29.267
-[door shuts nearby]
-[footsteps approaching]

02:33.730 --> 02:36.142
[door opening and closing]

02:37.320 --> 02:40.232
[Justin] Ho. Today is gonna suck.

02:43.490 --> 02:45.867
What, you mean, because of...?

02:45.950 --> 02:48.612
It's like the first day of school
or something.

02:49.330 --> 02:52.322
But, like, in some weird,
alternate universe where, like,

02:52.420 --> 02:54.911
everyone's been talking about me
for months.

02:55.710 --> 02:58.543
Uh, yeah, that's surreal.

03:01.090 --> 03:02.671
[indistinct chatter]

03:07.970 --> 03:12.395
[Andy] Hannah was the kind of person
that made you want to be better.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.314
The kind of person who left an impression
on everyone she met.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.158
Listen, this is weird, right?

03:23.780 --> 03:24.906
Um...

03:26.450 --> 03:27.280
Yeah.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.790
[Justin] This is about me, isn't it?

03:43.380 --> 03:44.927
Yeah, must be.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.847
[boy 1] Can't believe he'd show up here.

03:46.930 --> 03:48.921
[students murmuring]

03:58.610 --> 04:00.487
Hate to say I told you so, but...

04:01.280 --> 04:03.145
Or did we just not think
this part through?

04:03.240 --> 04:08.689
I'm curious, what happens to Jessica now?
Or Alex, or Justin, or you?

04:12.410 --> 04:15.243
Clay, did you not get any of my texts?

04:16.830 --> 04:20.948
-[stammering] My ringer must be off.
-[Clay's phone rings]

04:24.970 --> 04:27.507
Slqe? Hey, hello?

04:27.930 --> 04:32.674
Hey, Justin. I'd say welcome back,
but kind of shitty timing.

04:32.770 --> 04:35.557
-What do you mean?
-I mean about the tapes.

04:35.850 --> 04:37.056
What about the tapes?

04:37.860 --> 04:38.929
Did Clay not tell you?

04:40.190 --> 04:41.270
Maybe he doesn't even know.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.896
-Know about what?
-They're out.

04:42.990 --> 04:45.606
Someone posted them online.
Everyone listened all last night.

04:45.700 --> 04:46.564
-What?
-Yes.

04:46.660 --> 04:47.866
Are you fucking serious?

04:49.280 --> 04:52.283
Jensen, did you know about this?

04:54.460 --> 04:55.279
I, um...

04:57.330 --> 05:00.914
Yeah. I kind of, I guess I knew, but...

05:03.340 --> 05:05.217
-Look, I gotta go.
-But--

05:05.760 --> 05:09.423
Jensen. Hey, Clay!
The fuck are you going?

05:13.890 --> 05:15.721
We're having a meeting, by the way.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.314
[Andy] She always saw the best in people,
even if they couldn't see it themselves.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.897
But when she walked through those doors
at Liberty High,

05:24.650 --> 05:26.606
that's not the girl
they made her out to be.

05:26.700 --> 05:29.658
My future is at stake here.
What if Harvard finds out?

05:29.740 --> 05:32.903
What happened between you and Hannah
shouldn't keep you out of Harvard, Marcus.

05:32.990 --> 05:35.197
You don't know that.
This could blow up my entire life!

05:35.290 --> 05:38.327
-We'|l figure out a strategy when we meet.
-[cell phone buzzes]

05:38.420 --> 05:41.992
Everyone's confirmed.
Except... I didn't tell Jessica.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.751
I didn't know what to say to her.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.373
Tell her that there's somebody out here
trying to fuck up our lives.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.303
[Andy] When people looked at Hannah,
they saw what they wanted to see.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.518
They made assumptions. They spread rumors.

05:55.810 --> 05:57.380
-Hey, Jess.
-Hey.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.931
The hell is wrong with everyone today?

06:00.020 --> 06:02.397
-Shit. You haven't heard?
-Heard what?

06:03.400 --> 06:05.937
Maybe we should get out of here.
You want to skip school?

06:06.030 --> 06:07.315
Why? What's going on?

06:08.280 --> 06:11.238
-Tell me.
-The tapes. They're out.

06:12.120 --> 06:12.939
What?

06:15.750 --> 06:16.569
Oh, my God.

06:17.790 --> 06:21.419
I know. I'm so sorry.
This is-- it's so fucked up.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.162
[Andy] When I think of her
walking the halls with those kids...

06:24.250 --> 06:26.548
-[Bryce] Yeah, the ribbon-cutting.
-...those eyes on her...

06:26.630 --> 06:28.791
[Scott] So, with a giant pair of scissors
and all that?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.508
[Bryce] How the fuck else
do you cut ribbon, Scotty?

06:31.590 --> 06:34.058
[Scott] What? I don't know. I've never
been to something like this.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.131
[Bryce] Not that big a deal.
But bring your appetites.

06:36.220 --> 06:37.596
My dad promised food trucks.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.090
-Oh, hell, yes.
-Cool.

06:40.020 --> 06:44.013
-[Bryce] Hey, you're coming today, right?
-[Zach] What? Yeah, no. Totally.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.349
-Yeah.
-All right.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.560
Hey! Who did this?

06:49.860 --> 06:53.944
-Get the fuck back here!
-Hey, relax. It's fine. It'll come off.

06:55.990 --> 06:59.778
-Just a stupid fucking prank, right?
-Dude, that's pretty fucked up.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.820
-Should we do something?
-What would we do?

07:03.380 --> 07:05.871
-It's messed up.
-I'm not worried about it.

07:06.550 --> 07:08.791
[Bryce's voice over speaker]
You wanna call it rape, call it rape.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.620
She wanted me. Me.

07:11.050 --> 07:12.711
She was practically begging me
to fuck her.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.427
If that's rape,
then every girl at school--

07:14.510 --> 07:15.966
Where the fuck did you get that?

07:16.060 --> 07:18.301
-[playback stops]
-[Scott] What the hell was that?

07:19.140 --> 07:20.937
-Was that you?
-Yeah, it was me.

07:21.020 --> 07:23.090
[Scott] What do you want us to do?
Want me to go after them?

07:24.650 --> 07:26.060
How the fuck did this happen?

07:26.940 --> 07:28.521
Someone posted the tapes online.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.139
Last night.

07:30.900 --> 07:31.730
Someone?

07:33.700 --> 07:36.362
-Anonymously.
-[Scott] That's fucked up.

07:36.450 --> 07:37.530
What are you gonna do?

07:39.290 --> 07:40.245
Um...

07:43.000 --> 07:45.992
Uh, I, uh-- Ijust--
I need to think for a minute.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.086
I should call my dad.

07:50.010 --> 07:50.874
[sighs]

07:55.600 --> 07:58.307
Get off! Fucking let go!

07:59.810 --> 08:01.630
[boy] I knew you were a fucking pervert!

08:02.190 --> 08:03.475
Hey! Hey!

08:04.770 --> 08:06.510
Hey, you fucking assholes! Come on!

08:07.230 --> 08:09.721
But even if Hannah
couldn't trust her classmates,

08:09.820 --> 08:12.357
she should have been able
to trust the school itself,

08:12.450 --> 08:14.315
especially since we'd chosen Liberty

08:14.700 --> 08:18.739
specifically because of their emphasis
on safety and support.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.536
So when you enrolled Hannah at the school,

08:20.620 --> 08:23.248
did you ask about their policies
regarding bullying?

08:23.790 --> 08:24.745
Explicitly.

08:24.830 --> 08:28.163
We let them know that Hannah
had some problems at her previous school.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.371
Girls being mean, that sort of thing,

08:30.460 --> 08:33.213
and we didn't want her
to have to go through that again.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.757
And when you asked about those policies,
what were you told?

08:35.840 --> 08:38.092
They said they had
a zero-tolerance policy,

08:38.180 --> 08:40.967
that they took that kind of thing
extremely seriously,

08:41.060 --> 08:42.345
and that she was in good hands.

08:42.680 --> 08:46.434
But then they just stood back
and let everything happen.

08:47.980 --> 08:50.392
If the school had just stepped up
and paid attention,

08:50.480 --> 08:53.313
then things never would've gone
as bad as they did for her.

08:54.530 --> 08:59.479
And she'd still be that same
happy, hopeful kId she always was.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.827
[girl 1] I know. Did you hear what he said
on the last tape?

09:01.910 --> 09:04.617
[girl 2] Okay, but how could she
be dating him if he really did it?

09:04.710 --> 09:05.950
[girl 1] Unless she didn't know.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.620
Chle. Hey.

09:13.050 --> 09:15.291
The ribbon-cutting today, I might be late.

09:15.380 --> 09:18.213
-Are you still going?
-Yeah.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.255
-Why wouldn't I be?
-Okay.

09:21.010 --> 09:22.307
Well, we'll see you later.

09:22.390 --> 09:23.379
-Okay.
-Bye.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.339
[sighs]

09:33.400 --> 09:34.480
[sighs]

09:55.260 --> 09:56.875
[panﬁng]

09:58.550 --> 09:59.676
[stall door opens]

10:40.220 --> 10:41.175
[door opens]

10:45.350 --> 10:46.260
Here you are.

10:47.220 --> 10:49.097
I was starting to think
you were avoiding me today.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.384
What? No!

10:51.150 --> 10:52.139
No, I, uh...

10:53.480 --> 10:55.641
-Actua|ly, I got locked in.
-I know.

10:56.650 --> 10:57.605
I had to move the chair.

10:59.610 --> 11:00.565
You don't know why.

11:02.490 --> 11:03.525
I kind of do.

11:05.870 --> 11:06.939
Kind of everyone does.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.319
Oh.

11:10.710 --> 11:15.079
Well, I understand if you change your mind
about the movies.

11:16.170 --> 11:16.989
I didn't.

11:19.010 --> 11:21.467
You promised me a date.
You're not getting out of it that easily.

11:23.390 --> 11:25.961
Well-- Well, can't you tell Warren
to handle it faster?

11:26.060 --> 11:27.596
It's a shit show around here.

11:29.430 --> 11:31.261
I-- Hey, I gotta go.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.219
I heard your confession.

11:38.730 --> 11:40.140
You feeling okay, brother?

11:41.070 --> 11:44.028
-You didn't look so good the other day.
-You're going down, Bryce.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.862
How do you see that happening, exactly?
Without you going with me?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.860
I will do whatever I have to...

11:53.170 --> 11:54.569
to make you fucking pay.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.622
I'm not gonna pay
for a goddamn thing, Justin.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.877
I've got a legal team working for me
around the clock.

12:02.130 --> 12:03.677
I've got state fucking senators

12:03.760 --> 12:06.217
that will talk about
what a fine citizen I am.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.630
What have you got?

12:08.220 --> 12:10.597
A junkie mom and a deadbeat dad?

12:16.270 --> 12:17.430
You never met the guy.

12:17.730 --> 12:19.891
You're just a white trash
piece of shit, Justin.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.606
Nobody's gonna listen to your truth.

12:22.990 --> 12:25.151
Nobody in this world gives a shit
about you.

12:26.740 --> 12:29.117
You've got nothing and nobody.

12:43.420 --> 12:44.250
[Justin] Hey, Jess.

12:46.220 --> 12:49.007
Yeah, I'm just... Yeah, I'm at home.

12:51.720 --> 12:52.880
Yeah, I had to split.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.897
My mom called me super early.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.681
She got in a fight with Meth Seth, so...

13:04.780 --> 13:05.599
Are you...

13:07.530 --> 13:08.360
okay?

13:09.160 --> 13:12.197
I mean,
you were pretty out of it last night.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.991
I mean, we both were. [chuckles]

13:22.090 --> 13:23.125
Huh? Uh...

13:23.920 --> 13:26.002
Yeah, we did.

13:27.930 --> 13:28.828
Do you not...?

13:30.760 --> 13:31.840
Do you not remember?

13:34.850 --> 13:37.387
Shit, yeah, we were both pretty trashed.

13:38.020 --> 13:39.089
Sorry, I mean...

13:39.560 --> 13:43.189
Yeah, you seemed like
you were pretty into it last night.

13:46.780 --> 13:49.442
Oh, we must've just both passed out after.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.616
Yeah, it was a fucking great party.

14:08.340 --> 14:09.500
-You sick fuck!
-What the hell?

14:11.050 --> 14:12.756
-I will destroy you.
-[Cyrus] Hey, back off, man.

14:12.850 --> 14:14.135
-Get the fuck off!
-[Cyrus] Hey!

14:16.100 --> 14:17.806
-You took pictures of my sister?
-What?

14:17.890 --> 14:19.938
You followed her
and took fucking pictures of her?

14:20.020 --> 14:21.146
-No.
-Yes.

14:21.230 --> 14:22.561
You took them
and put them in my locker.

14:22.650 --> 14:25.778
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-This isn't me. I didn't fucking do this.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.566
-It's fucking you, isn't it?
-What?

14:27.650 --> 14:29.140
You put the rat in my locker,
now this?

14:29.240 --> 14:31.481
-What do you want from me?
-You got a rat in your locker?

14:31.820 --> 14:33.902
-Someone's fucking with you, too?
-Yeah, you.

14:36.330 --> 14:38.457
Fuck, it's got to be Bryce.
It's fucking Bryce.

14:38.540 --> 14:41.373
He's trying to keep us quiet, okay?
It happened to me, too.

14:43.130 --> 14:44.415
It's not me, I swear.

14:47.970 --> 14:48.789
Zach.

14:51.260 --> 14:54.252
You come near my sister
and I'll murder you, you hear me?

15:15.030 --> 15:16.110
[sighs]

15:16.200 --> 15:17.747
So, what do you want, an eighth?

15:18.040 --> 15:21.999
-I got a really great hybrid right now.
-No, no, I need something stronger.

15:23.460 --> 15:24.666
You got any Oxy?

15:25.590 --> 15:28.548
Shit, man. I can get you Ow.
It's bucks, dude.

15:29.130 --> 15:32.509
-They got the supply choked off.
-Okay, what can I get right now?

15:33.390 --> 15:36.302
I need to get really fucking high,
and I've got 20 bucks.

15:37.930 --> 15:41.559
I got some H. If you really wanna
get blind, you got to shoot it.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.470
I...

15:44.810 --> 15:49.065
-I mean, I don't got works or anything.
-I can hook you up.

15:53.320 --> 15:57.233
[Sonya] Mr. Baker, you're currently dating
someone by the name of Valerie Hampton,

15:57.330 --> 15:58.319
is that correct?

15:59.700 --> 16:01.748
Yes, my wife and I...

16:03.290 --> 16:04.166
we're separated.

16:04.250 --> 16:08.584
Is it not true that you first began dating
Ms. Hampton in April of last year?

16:08.920 --> 16:12.253
Prior to Hannah's death
and prior to your separation?

16:13.220 --> 16:14.426
It's not something I'm proud of,

16:14.510 --> 16:17.047
but, yes, we saw each other
for about a month, then I ended it.

16:17.390 --> 16:20.598
Uh, we didn't reconnect
until after Hannah's death,

16:20.680 --> 16:22.261
after my separation.

16:22.350 --> 16:25.433
But if Hannah was alive
when you first started dating Ms. Hampton,

16:25.520 --> 16:27.476
isn't it possible she knew
about the affair?

16:27.560 --> 16:29.187
[Dennis] Objection, speculation.

16:29.270 --> 16:31.238
Your Honor,
it's necessary to establish a timeline

16:31.320 --> 16:33.561
so that we can_take into account
all possmle effects

16:33.650 --> 16:34.730
on Hannah's mental state.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.617
Overruled. Proceed.

16:36.700 --> 16:42.115
Mr. Baker, is it not possible
that Hannah knew, given the timeline?

16:42.660 --> 16:45.288
Regardless of whether the two of you
ever discussed it.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.580
Unless you...

16:51.170 --> 16:52.296
You did discuss it.

16:55.590 --> 16:56.636
[car alarm chirps]

17:04.980 --> 17:06.049
Okay. Okay.

17:09.360 --> 17:10.600
I'll call you when I can.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.734
[engine starts, car departs]

17:44.980 --> 17:45.799
Hannah?

17:50.060 --> 17:51.812
-How could you do that?
-I love your mother.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.686
I love her with all my heart,
I swear to you.

17:53.980 --> 17:58.349
But a marriage, honey...
Honey, a marriage is a complicated thing.

18:00.700 --> 18:05.364
It's a terrible moment when you realize
that your, your parents aren't perfect.

18:05.450 --> 18:07.702
Don't try and turn this
into a life lesson for me.

18:07.790 --> 18:08.609
I'm-I'm...

18:09.500 --> 18:10.455
I'm sorry.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.997
Look, I'll end it.

18:14.340 --> 18:15.796
I'll end it tonight.

18:17.010 --> 18:19.638
And you'll tell Mom, okay? Or I will.

18:34.270 --> 18:36.852
I told my wife about Valerie immediately.

18:38.360 --> 18:42.239
We dealt with it, and afterwards,
it wasn't a problem anymore.

18:42.410 --> 18:43.229
Hannah knew that.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.651
[Sonya] She also knew that you had cheated
on her mother

18:45.740 --> 18:48.573
and she committed suicide
less than six months afterward.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.036
No, we moved forward as a family--

18:50.120 --> 18:51.951
[Sonya] Thank you, Mr. Baker.
No further questions.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.201
No, her problems were with the school.

18:54.290 --> 18:56.508
With us, she was always a happy girl,
she was hopeful.

18:56.590 --> 18:58.660
-She was upbeat--
-[judge] The witness can stand down.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.751
Why can't we explain
what actually happened?

19:04.850 --> 19:06.920
-Why can't we make a statement?
-It's not the time.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.636
When is the time? Everyone knows
what she had to say about it.

19:09.730 --> 19:13.302
You wouldn't_want_it to sound like
you were attacking this gIrl to the press.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.607
I just don't want people to think
I'm hiding from this.

19:15.690 --> 19:18.932
-I want them to hear my side.
-They will as soon as you testify.

19:19.030 --> 19:21.351
In the meantime, just block out the noise.

19:22.110 --> 19:23.987
Now, let's try and enjoy
this damn thing, shall we?

19:24.070 --> 19:25.697
We got a lot of eyes on us today.

19:26.450 --> 19:28.611
You have some fans, dear.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.702
[kids chattering]

19:34.380 --> 19:36.416
This other girl, are we worried about her?

19:37.670 --> 19:41.754
-The girlfriend? No, she seems harmless.
-No, not that Chle.

19:42.760 --> 19:43.795
She's a trifle.

19:44.090 --> 19:46.923
The girl on the tape. At the party?

19:47.010 --> 19:49.843
We don't even know if there was anyone
at any party. It's just a story.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.183
Is that the position you're taking,
or something you truly believe?

19:56.650 --> 19:57.810
These kids, Nora...

19:59.030 --> 20:00.645
they want what Bryce has.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.862
You don't think your son
could do these kinds of things?

20:05.200 --> 20:06.155
Of course not.

20:07.330 --> 20:08.228
Jesus, do you?

20:11.080 --> 20:12.650
I know the boy we raised.

20:14.080 --> 20:14.910
Are you sure?

20:24.510 --> 20:27.343
-Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Walker?
-[Barry] Hi.

20:27.430 --> 20:29.557
What do you have to say for yourself?
And your son?

20:29.640 --> 20:30.959
[Barry chuckles] Excuse us.

20:31.060 --> 20:33.187
[Jackie] Everybody knows what he did
to Hannah Baker.

20:33.270 --> 20:35.397
How can you let him
be celebrated like this?

20:35.480 --> 20:36.890
We have everything well contained.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.141
[Jackie] You should be ashamed
of yourself, Mr. Bolan.

20:39.820 --> 20:42.357
[Olivia] The school is at fault.
The school.

20:42.990 --> 20:45.777
These are children in their care.

20:47.530 --> 20:50.579
If they know something is wrong,
they should take action.

20:57.250 --> 20:58.126
Zach.

20:58.670 --> 21:01.332
Hey. Did anything...

21:01.960 --> 21:03.916
Did anything happen to you
at school today?

21:04.420 --> 21:05.330
Like what?

21:05.840 --> 21:10.846
The field looks great.
And the news is here. What an occasion!

21:12.600 --> 21:13.510
We're not staying.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.009
Why not?

21:17.520 --> 21:21.775
Do you know why the news vans are here?
Do you know about the tapes?

21:23.110 --> 21:25.066
I know that she didn't say anything
about you

21:25.150 --> 21:26.447
that you hadn't already said--

21:26.530 --> 21:28.316
-That's not it, Mom.
-And at a time like this,

21:28.410 --> 21:30.571
your friend Bryce needs you
to stand by him.

21:34.000 --> 21:34.819
Let's go, May.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.281
Zachary Dempsey, if you are not here,
what are people gonna say?

21:40.170 --> 21:41.956
[Olivia] These kids are going through
so much.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.507
And parents don't know.

21:59.690 --> 22:00.600
Good afternoon.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.431
I'm Marcus Cole, student body president.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.066
[crowd cheers, whistles]

22:08.530 --> 22:09.519
Happy to be here.

22:10.910 --> 22:12.070
Happy to be here today.

22:13.950 --> 22:16.327
Since 1913,
Liberty High has been committed

22:16.410 --> 22:18.867
to helping students achieve
academic excellence

22:18.960 --> 22:21.838
in a safe, supportive environment.

22:24.460 --> 22:27.714
But in recent years, our values have...

22:30.640 --> 22:31.538
gone to shit.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.097
[low murmurs]

22:34.350 --> 22:35.669
I'm part of the problem.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.727
I lead a group called EnGUYtened,

22:38.810 --> 22:41.552
which is supposed to be
for enlightened guys.

22:44.150 --> 22:48.940
But today, I'm...
officially resigning from that group.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.195
Because I'm a hypocrite.

22:51.700 --> 22:54.988
How can I say
that I care about protecting girls

22:55.080 --> 22:56.490
when I've been protecting...

23:03.500 --> 23:05.832
a rapist like Bryce Walker?

23:05.920 --> 23:07.126
[crowd murmuring]

23:07.460 --> 23:09.462
[Jackie] Bryce Walker should pay
for what he's done!

23:10.090 --> 23:12.968
Hannah Baker was a victim of Bryce Walker.

23:13.510 --> 23:15.558
Liberty needs to change
the culture of their school.

23:15.640 --> 23:18.427
-[Bolan] Okay, okay. All right. Uh...
-[Jackie] It does not protect a child.

23:18.890 --> 23:22.724
[Bolan] Well, our students are playing
some sort of prank.

23:22.810 --> 23:24.937
[Jackie] We must protect children
like Hannah Baker.

23:25.020 --> 23:26.681
[Bolan] One that's in poor taste,
obviously.

23:27.110 --> 23:29.237
But let's move ahead with our program.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.407
What the hell is going on at this school?

23:32.490 --> 23:34.697
The young man clearly felt burdened
by something.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.407
He needed to make a confession.

23:36.490 --> 23:38.902
It's blackmail. _
Someone's got something on hIm.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.706
[Bolan] We are so thrilled to be he--

23:41.040 --> 23:43.918
Excuse me._
Can we have some quret, please?

23:44.500 --> 23:45.330
Thank you.

23:45.540 --> 23:46.837
We're thrilled to be here.

23:48.340 --> 23:51.798
-Would you please join me... [indistinct]
-You know this is all bullshit, right?

23:52.760 --> 23:56.218
-It's all lies.
-Yeah, of course, I know.

23:56.430 --> 23:59.342
...the parents of our team captain,
Bryce Walker.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.357
[Tyler] I can't believe
he actually fucking did it.

24:12.530 --> 24:14.600
We're like the fucking puppet masters
of the school.

24:16.070 --> 24:18.231
We can get anyone to do anything.

24:21.080 --> 24:21.899
All right.

24:27.710 --> 24:32.795
-Mmm! Nice. You're getting good.
-Well, success builds confidence.

24:36.470 --> 24:37.755
Pranking the president...

24:40.350 --> 24:41.510
pulling the ladies.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.511
And by ladies, I mean my sister.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.971
Kenzie told me you guys
are going on a little date this weekend.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.062
I was gonna tell you about it, you know.

24:49.150 --> 24:51.641
I just, I don't want it to be weird.
I just wanna--

24:51.860 --> 24:55.352
No, it's all good. I mean, I trust you.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.362
As long as you're not actually
some crazy stalker

24:58.450 --> 25:00.361
who follows girls around with a camera.

25:04.830 --> 25:06.570
[crow cawing]

25:16.590 --> 25:17.830
Holy shit!

25:24.600 --> 25:25.555
Shit.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.766
Hey! Yo, dude.

25:29.150 --> 25:30.310
Dude, come look at this.

25:32.150 --> 25:33.026
Did you hit it?

25:41.870 --> 25:42.689
Shit.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.069
Dude.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.785
Look at it, it was like...

25:48.120 --> 25:51.032
It was, like, flying, like,
30 seconds ago, and now it's just...

25:53.050 --> 25:53.869
I mean...

25:58.930 --> 26:01.967
[Olivia] Parents don't know
what happens at school.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.681
Damn it, Clay, pick up the phone.

26:10.150 --> 26:12.220
Do you have any idea what you fucking did?

26:12.480 --> 26:14.311
And where the hell are you right now?

26:20.120 --> 26:21.690
What the fuck did you just do?

26:21.780 --> 26:24.692
Hey! Look, I came to you for help
and you didn't do shit, man!

26:24.790 --> 26:26.496
They're blackmailing me.
They made me say that!

26:26.580 --> 26:29.322
-Who the fuck is "they"?
-I don't know! How do I know?

26:29.580 --> 26:34.085
Look, if that video gets out, man,
it's out forever, okay?

26:35.010 --> 26:38.798
And I still have a future.
But for you, the tapes are out.

26:39.630 --> 26:41.928
I didn't say anything
that hasn't been said already.

26:42.010 --> 26:45.013
Big mistake. Big fucking mistake.

26:55.690 --> 26:58.568
[Olivia] There are limits to what
we can do to help another person,

26:59.320 --> 27:01.311
no matter how much we wish there weren't.

27:01.990 --> 27:04.026
We need to take these tapes to the police.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.441
We need to get these boys
that did this to her.

27:07.410 --> 27:09.651
Noelle, I don't care what she wants.

27:10.580 --> 27:12.207
She's here. I'll call you back.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.292
Yes, I promise. I'll call. Love you.

27:15.380 --> 27:17.371
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, baby girl.

27:17.670 --> 27:18.625
Let's talk.

27:19.720 --> 27:23.429
-[sighs] Look, I don't want to talk.
-Honey.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.750
Your mom and I wanna be there for you.

27:25.850 --> 27:27.556
-Whatever you need.
-I'm fine.

27:28.060 --> 27:30.597
I just... I have a lot of homework, okay?

27:30.980 --> 27:33.050
Mrs. Baker called for you
a little while ago.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.145
What did she want?

27:40.740 --> 27:42.947
To check in on you,
see how you're doing.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.658
I just... I need to be alone, okay?

27:50.750 --> 27:54.208
[Olivia] So there's a limit
to what we can do to protect them.

27:55.040 --> 27:59.329
And there are some things
you just can't protect them from.

28:00.380 --> 28:04.339
I couldn't be there every time
someone judged her or shamed her.

28:04.930 --> 28:06.807
I didn't always have the answers.

28:08.010 --> 28:10.922
I didn't always know
all the right things to say.

28:11.310 --> 28:12.516
[Jessica sighs]

28:18.610 --> 28:20.987
After everything that happened
at Liberty High...

28:22.990 --> 28:25.311
Well, I think it was just too much
for Hannah.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.907
After all that, it was just too much.

28:28.990 --> 28:35.372
[Dennis] And did anyone at Liberty inform
you of the issues happening on campus?

28:35.460 --> 28:40.796
The Hot or Not List being circulated,
the suicidal poem being read aloud,

28:40.880 --> 28:44.919
the anonymous question,
specifically about suicide?

28:45.300 --> 28:47.507
No. No, they never...

28:47.800 --> 28:51.429
I mean, had they sent out some kind
of notification to all the parents,

28:51.520 --> 28:54.978
we could have talked to Hannah,
we could have started a conversation,

28:55.060 --> 28:58.302
but they never informed us
about any of it.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.643
So the administration was either ignorant
of the problems under their own roof,

29:02.740 --> 29:05.561
or they were aware and did nothing?

29:05.660 --> 29:06.524
Exactly.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.269
Thank you, Mrs. Baker.

29:12.370 --> 29:15.533
Mrs. Baker, were you aware
that Hannah knew about

29:15.620 --> 29:17.497
-your husband's affair?
-I--

29:19.840 --> 29:21.205
No, I was not aware, but I--

29:21.300 --> 29:25.088
You never picked up on any signs from her
that she may have known

29:25.180 --> 29:27.637
or might have been in distress?

29:31.470 --> 29:33.097
[Olivia sobbing]

29:39.020 --> 29:40.351
[shop door opening]

29:45.610 --> 29:48.352
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, sweetheart.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.151
-Are you okay?
-Oh, yeah.

29:51.240 --> 29:54.789
Your father and I just had
a little argument, that's all.

29:55.750 --> 29:58.412
Nothing serious. [blows nose]

29:59.500 --> 30:01.912
-How was school?
-School was school.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.413
But here, I, um, got you something.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.000
Inses?

30:10.510 --> 30:11.636
They're my favorite.

30:13.180 --> 30:14.636
What's the occasion?

30:14.720 --> 30:16.676
Nothing, I just saw them
in the window on my way home

30:16.770 --> 30:19.682
-and remembered how much you like irises.
-Aww.

30:19.770 --> 30:22.182
I know I never give you anything
unless it's, like,

30:22.270 --> 30:23.396
Mother's Day or something,

30:23.480 --> 30:27.940
but I just wanted to say thank you
for being a great mother every day.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.986
Hannah, honey...

30:35.200 --> 30:36.440
You're so thoughtful.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.546
No, I never noticed anything.

30:46.710 --> 30:50.043
So, even you didn't notice the signs
that Hannah was in distress,

30:50.130 --> 30:52.007
and yet you expect the school
to have done so?

30:52.100 --> 30:54.466
-[Dennis] Objection. Argumentative.
-[Sonya] Withdrawn.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.769
Mrs. Baker, you say that you didn't notice
whether Hannah was in distress.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.431
But is there anything
in your family history

31:01.520 --> 31:04.148
to suggest that Hannah
may have had a predisposition

31:04.230 --> 31:06.141
to any mental health problems?

31:06.820 --> 31:10.779
There have been some issues with anxiety
on my side of the family,

31:10.860 --> 31:15.479
but nothing serious,
and Hannah never showed any signs.

31:15.790 --> 31:19.362
And were any of these issues
ever serious enough to require treatment?

31:20.000 --> 31:23.959
Well, yes, I've seen a therapist
on and off over the years

31:24.040 --> 31:25.166
during stressful periods--

31:25.250 --> 31:28.083
So you've received treatment
from a mental health care professional,

31:28.170 --> 31:30.582
but you never thought that your daughter
might require similar care?

31:30.680 --> 31:34.002
She was just a child and, again,
she never showed any signs.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.718
Did you or did you not take Hannah
to see a therapist, Mrs. Baker?

31:41.640 --> 31:42.846
No, I never did.

31:51.490 --> 31:52.946
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:53.030 --> 31:54.110
You made it.

31:54.620 --> 31:55.735
Yeah, I did.

31:56.450 --> 31:57.986
-Hi. [chuckles]
-Hi.

32:00.370 --> 32:04.204
[stammering] It's so good to see you.
You look great.

32:04.540 --> 32:06.531
For a person in a mental health facility?

32:07.050 --> 32:12.625
No. No, just for a person in the world
who always looks great.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.540
[laughs] Stop. I'm kidding.

32:15.800 --> 32:16.630
And thank you.

32:17.510 --> 32:21.674
I was, um, really glad you called back.

32:22.140 --> 32:26.179
Oh, I just got my phone privileges.
I haven't been dodging you.

32:26.270 --> 32:28.101
Wait, so you just got
all those messages at once?

32:28.320 --> 32:30.777
-I hope you skipped some.
-I listened to every one.

32:30.860 --> 32:33.602
Okay, guys, we're starting yoga in here
in a few minutes

32:33.700 --> 32:37.693
for whoever's_ interested
and who won't be making fun of the poses.

32:37.780 --> 32:39.736
Then we've got our small group sessions.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.361
Bring your share journals
or pay the price.

32:45.790 --> 32:47.621
-Cool.
-[both chuckle]

32:50.000 --> 32:50.830
This, uh...

32:51.630 --> 32:55.293
-This place seems really nice.
-Come on, I'll give you the VIP tour.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.216
[Slqe] Like, everyone's brain chemistry
is different,

32:59.310 --> 33:01.676
so it might take them a few tries

33:01.770 --> 33:04.227
before they can find
the right combination of meds.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.357
Wait, is this too much right now?

33:09.400 --> 33:11.527
No, no, no. It's just...

33:14.450 --> 33:16.020
Look, are they sure it's bipolar?

33:17.410 --> 33:18.775
It feels like kind of a blurry line

33:18.870 --> 33:24.035
between someone being manic and also just,
you know, being in a really good mood.

33:24.370 --> 33:29.160
[chuckles] Clay, I tried to jerk you off
in front of your parents.

33:30.130 --> 33:32.837
I mean, that wasn't just a "good mood."

33:34.590 --> 33:35.420
[Clay] Yeah.

33:36.340 --> 33:39.889
[chuckles] Yeah, point taken.
That was pretty fucked up.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.881
But the meds and everything...

33:46.440 --> 33:48.510
What if that all, like, changes you?

33:50.400 --> 33:51.810
I hope it does.

33:53.320 --> 33:58.189
Look, the person that I was,
it wasn't really working for me.

33:58.950 --> 34:01.487
Like, the good moods,
they could be amazing, but...

34:02.370 --> 34:03.234
I was like...

34:05.200 --> 34:07.828
dancing on the edge of a really high cliff

34:08.540 --> 34:13.045
and the fall
was just really fucking hard and far.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.178
-I'm sorry.
-Wait.

34:22.350 --> 34:24.136
You know it's not your fault, right?

34:26.600 --> 34:27.635
No, I-- I know.

34:30.440 --> 34:31.646
I don't know if you do.

34:43.910 --> 34:45.229
All this time...

34:46.870 --> 34:49.998
-How could you keep that from me?
-I'm sorry, Olivia.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.872
I thought I fixed it. I didn't wanna
make things worse for you or Hannah.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.871
-I just wanted to move on.
-Clearly.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.257
-I didn't know how to talk to you anymore.
-[scoffs]

35:01.970 --> 35:04.052
I didn't know how to tell you
that I needed to...

35:04.970 --> 35:05.925
[stammers]

35:06.560 --> 35:10.519
...feel loved and held,
and I needed to be needed.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.476
Oh.

35:12.480 --> 35:15.392
-Oh, so this is my fault?
-It's not your fault.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.062
I'm not blaming you, I'm blaming us.
We should have communicated.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.277
We should have noticed
that our baby girl was suffering.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.770
We should have done something.

35:21.860 --> 35:23.691
Don't you dare, okay?

35:23.780 --> 35:26.692
Don't you dare make me feel
like I failed my daughter.

35:27.370 --> 35:29.577
Okay?
If we lose this trial, it's your fault.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.879
If we win this trial, it's my fault.
How can you not see that?

35:32.960 --> 35:35.201
How can you not feel that
sitting on that stand?

35:35.290 --> 35:36.291
That's all it took?

35:36.590 --> 35:40.299
This lawyer gets in your head,
and suddenly we're on trial?

35:41.800 --> 35:44.883
I never wanted to, but deep down,
I thought we had a case.

35:44.970 --> 35:47.677
I believed that the school,
the bullies, that monster

35:48.270 --> 35:52.229
were responsible for our losing Hannah,
but we're in this, too, Liv.

35:55.610 --> 35:57.146
We're part of it too, Liv.

36:00.110 --> 36:03.489
And if you can't see that now,
I don't think you ever will.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.200
I don't want to fight anymore.

36:16.960 --> 36:17.870
I don't wanna fight.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.588
I don't wanna fight with you
and not in this courtroom.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.887
I think this case
is better off without me.

36:30.810 --> 36:31.799
And so are you.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.446
So, when do you come home?

36:48.120 --> 36:51.078
The thing is, my mom doesn't want me
to go back to Liberty.

36:52.620 --> 36:54.576
She wants me to transfer schools.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.492
Like East County?

36:59.460 --> 37:00.757
Like another state.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.961
I'm going to live with my aunt and uncle.

37:05.510 --> 37:06.499
Wait, you...

37:08.180 --> 37:09.420
You're never coming back?

37:10.970 --> 37:14.519
-I need to hit the reset button.
-The reset button.

37:14.770 --> 37:17.477
-To delete everything that came before?
-No, not whatI mean.

37:18.520 --> 37:25.141
Not delete, not you, not our friendship,
but I need to move on.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.026
-They're making you do that?
-No.

37:27.910 --> 37:29.025
I'm doing it.

37:31.040 --> 37:36.489
I can't keep pretending like I'm okay,
like I don't need to work to get well,

37:36.580 --> 37:39.458
like it's everyone's fault but mine.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.877
I wanna live a better life than that.

37:56.980 --> 38:00.108
-You're gonna forget me.
-Oh, my God, I never could.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.976
I'm just gonna be this one guy
you knew one time.

38:07.950 --> 38:10.020
I can let you go and still love you.

38:13.950 --> 38:15.781
I'll always love you.

38:20.670 --> 38:21.625
I'm gonna miss you.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.297
I'm gonna miss you, too.

38:27.720 --> 38:28.675
[sniffles]

38:54.450 --> 38:55.940
You're a good person, Clay.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.246
And you can help people.

38:59.420 --> 39:03.242
Just maybe not how you think
they need to be helped.

39:23.810 --> 39:24.640
Clay?

39:28.190 --> 39:29.020
Clay!

39:31.200 --> 39:32.656
Hey, I need to talk to you.

39:36.990 --> 39:39.117
Clay, why aren't you answering your phone?

39:40.660 --> 39:41.490
Justin.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.701
Hey, dickhead, where's Clay?

39:45.670 --> 39:46.910
Justin, I said--

39:50.130 --> 39:50.960
Justin.

39:52.260 --> 39:53.079
Fuck.

39:57.260 --> 39:59.342
Justin! Hey, wake up.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.089
Wake the fuck up!

40:01.390 --> 40:02.550
-Hey, wake up.
-[groans]

40:02.810 --> 40:03.640
Justin!

40:04.940 --> 40:05.759
Roll over!

40:07.570 --> 40:09.731
-Come on, Justin. _I can't roll you!
-[gagg|ng]

40:11.360 --> 40:12.486
[yells]

40:15.490 --> 40:16.366
Fuck!

40:16.450 --> 40:17.940
[gurgles]

40:21.540 --> 40:22.416
Fuck!

40:22.500 --> 40:24.456
I won't fucking let you die.

40:27.130 --> 40:27.994
Fuck!

40:29.840 --> 40:31.796
[gasps, coughing]

40:34.930 --> 40:35.749
Oh, fuck.

40:37.220 --> 40:38.676
[panﬁng]

40:40.810 --> 40:41.629
Hey.

40:42.060 --> 40:43.516
[coughs]

40:47.900 --> 40:49.936
[Olivia] We don't always get
second chances...

40:51.650 --> 40:52.696
to help people.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.275
To be there...

40:57.320 --> 40:58.321
in the right way.

40:59.910 --> 41:00.820
To love them.

41:01.120 --> 41:01.939
[doorbell chimes]

41:05.920 --> 41:06.739
Hi.

41:08.540 --> 41:09.586
My dad said you called.

41:09.960 --> 41:12.417
And I heard what happened
in court today and...

41:13.050 --> 41:15.041
I don't know, I just wanted
to reach out, you know,

41:15.130 --> 41:16.631
to see if there's anything I could do.

41:19.100 --> 41:19.919
Come in.

41:22.100 --> 41:25.228
I think it's a tolerance thing.
I don't know.

41:26.520 --> 41:30.012
-I've only ever shot up a couple times.
-You could've fucking died.

41:30.110 --> 41:31.099
[scoffs]

41:31.530 --> 41:33.600
Like anyone would even care
at this point.

41:33.860 --> 41:35.441
Dude, don't joke about that.

41:37.660 --> 41:38.558
Shit.

41:40.620 --> 41:41.530
Sorry.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.570
Hey, hey.

41:46.540 --> 41:47.359
Drink this.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.595
Where's the scar?

42:06.440 --> 42:07.304
Oh, it's...

42:08.810 --> 42:09.890
There's scars.

42:10.900 --> 42:13.892
But they're under my hair.
That's why I grew it out.

42:16.610 --> 42:18.316
Yeah, I remember how it used to be.

42:19.820 --> 42:21.868
When you first started at Liberty,

42:22.620 --> 42:26.408
some of the guys were like,
"That hair makes him a fag."

42:26.830 --> 42:31.415
But I was like, "That's fucking stupid."

42:33.630 --> 42:35.416
Well, that's super kind of you.

42:36.760 --> 42:37.670
Yeah, well...

42:40.640 --> 42:41.504
Whatever.

42:47.180 --> 42:49.398
You're still in love with Jessica,
aren't you?

42:51.940 --> 42:53.066
It doesn't matter.

42:54.020 --> 42:56.272
Look at you. It clearly does.

42:58.030 --> 42:59.019
[door opens]

43:01.950 --> 43:03.156
What the hell happened?

43:04.080 --> 43:07.072
He shot up and then he almost choked
on his own puke.

43:07.660 --> 43:10.322
What the fuck is wrong with you, Justin?
You were just clean--

43:10.420 --> 43:11.910
Leave him alone, okay?

43:12.630 --> 43:14.120
What? Now you're defending him?

43:14.210 --> 43:16.917
Yeah, what the hell were you thinking
with the tapes, Clay?

43:17.010 --> 43:18.875
You have any idea
what you did to Jessica?

43:18.970 --> 43:21.131
Yeah, I was trying to get justice
for Hannah.

43:21.470 --> 43:23.426
And I'm sorry if it hurt Jessica,

43:23.510 --> 43:25.671
but maybe it's time for her truth
to come out, too.

43:25.760 --> 43:29.139
What the fuck gives you the right
to decide what needs to come out?

43:31.650 --> 43:35.063
Look, I've done everything I can,

43:36.820 --> 43:39.027
everything I can think of
to make things right.

43:40.610 --> 43:42.237
But I can't do it alone.

43:45.160 --> 43:45.979
Okay?

43:46.660 --> 43:48.196
Look, I'm sorry about the tapes.

43:48.700 --> 43:50.656
But it's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

43:52.330 --> 43:53.410
And I need you guys.

43:55.340 --> 43:57.376
[Caleb] Turn your hands.
There you go, good hit.

43:58.590 --> 43:59.409
Yeah.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.078
Wow!

44:02.470 --> 44:05.291
-You did need to come in.
-Yeah. I feel better already.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.512
Ah. Well, the night is young.
It could get even better.

44:08.600 --> 44:09.476
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.595
What you got in mind?

44:11.100 --> 44:11.930
Oh!

44:12.600 --> 44:15.307
Hey! Hey, I didn't know
you were coming in today.

44:16.070 --> 44:18.220
Lucas, this is Tony. Tony, this is Lucas.

44:18.530 --> 44:20.566
Oh, hey, man. Good to meet you.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.272
Yeah, man. It's good to meet you, too.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.115
I'll talk to you later.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.498
I should get out of here anyway.
I'm pretty tired.

44:32.120 --> 44:32.950
Hey.

44:33.710 --> 44:35.371
Have we trained together before?

44:36.170 --> 44:38.707
No, I don't, uh, I don't think so.

44:40.590 --> 44:41.579
Have a good night.

44:44.890 --> 44:46.209
[Olivia] We don't always know

44:47.470 --> 44:49.210
everything a kid is going through.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.339
[knock at door]

44:51.230 --> 44:53.596
Hey, buddy. We agreed. Door open, yeah?

44:53.980 --> 44:56.141
-It was open.
-No, it was almost closed.

44:56.230 --> 44:59.108
We agreed 45 degrees open
all the time, all right?

44:59.480 --> 45:01.937
Then last month,
we negotiated down to 30.

45:02.030 --> 45:05.602
It was at three just now,
so keep it open, all right?

45:06.280 --> 45:07.190
Wait, Dad?

45:07.700 --> 45:11.613
I'm really sorry about last night.
I didn't mean to ruin the party.

45:13.080 --> 45:14.069
Oh, buddy.

45:18.460 --> 45:21.873
You didn't.
And I feel like I owe you an apology.

45:22.630 --> 45:25.793
Because I think
I've been pushing you too hard.

45:26.510 --> 45:29.297
No, I think maybe it's a good thing.

45:30.350 --> 45:33.672
Because today I, like,
I really pushed myself

45:33.770 --> 45:35.180
and it kind of turned out okay.

45:35.600 --> 45:38.262
-That's great.
-Yeah, and my memory's getting better.

45:39.900 --> 45:42.642
Good, well, the doctor didn't say
you were stuck, right?

45:42.730 --> 45:46.689
He said that your recovery
would be unpredictable,

45:46.780 --> 45:48.566
but there's always hope.

45:48.660 --> 45:49.866
-Yeah, I know.
-Yeah.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.652
Um, so, last night, with that video game,

45:53.750 --> 45:57.208
it actually started making me remember
this other one, Desert Duty.

45:57.880 --> 46:02.374
So, I was thinking, um,
just maybe if I play that one again,

46:02.460 --> 46:04.291
it would actually help me remember more.

46:05.170 --> 46:08.333
-That's a shooter game, Desert Duty ?
-Yeah, I know, Dad.

46:08.430 --> 46:10.341
But it's not like that. I just...

46:11.930 --> 46:13.966
There's something that I gotta remember.

46:17.190 --> 46:20.148
Yeah, buddy, I don't know.

46:22.570 --> 46:23.605
Yeah, no, I know.

46:25.190 --> 46:29.103
I get it. It was probably stupid anyway.

46:31.910 --> 46:34.231
-I should probably get some sleep.
-All right.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.821
-Night.
-Night.

46:41.380 --> 46:46.158
[Olivia] But, kids, they don't always
tell you everything they're feeling.

46:56.770 --> 47:01.184
"I'm saying that the house is on fire,
and all I know how to do is write poems.

47:01.270 --> 47:05.525
All I know how to do is arrange flowers
on the table of a burning home.

47:05.730 --> 47:09.143
I am pressing against the frame.
I am chanting the right words.

47:10.570 --> 47:12.947
I am gripping my fists
and letting them go."

47:14.080 --> 47:15.069
Wow.

47:16.750 --> 47:17.865
Hannah wrote that?

47:18.250 --> 47:19.706
I must have read it a million times.

47:19.790 --> 47:22.247
The whole time,
I thought it was about that school.

47:22.750 --> 47:25.799
The suffocating, oh, my God,
it's right there in front of me.

47:26.300 --> 47:29.212
The burning home, the flowers...

47:31.260 --> 47:32.830
It was about her dad's affair.

47:34.350 --> 47:35.669
There she was, trying to comfort me,

47:35.760 --> 47:37.307
when I should've been
trying to comfort her.

47:37.390 --> 47:38.880
I mean, why didn't I see it?

47:38.980 --> 47:41.551
Olivia, you can't blame yourself.
This is Andy's fault.

47:41.650 --> 47:44.266
Jackie, please don't tell me
how to feel right now.

47:49.360 --> 47:51.021
-I'm sorry.
-You're right.

47:51.280 --> 47:55.159
No, I'm sorry. It just--
It's more complicated than that.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.616
I didn't mean to overstep.

47:59.160 --> 48:01.708
You know,
I think maybe I should head to bed.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.201
-No, no, no.
-No, it's been a long day.

48:04.460 --> 48:06.496
Really, I need to get some rest.

48:07.630 --> 48:09.200
It was nice meeting you, Jessica.

48:22.480 --> 48:23.299
Well...

48:26.770 --> 48:27.680
[sighs deeply]

48:29.690 --> 48:31.271
You must think I'm an idiot,

48:31.360 --> 48:33.658
wanting to protect a man
who doesn't deserve it.

48:35.370 --> 48:36.234
I get it.

48:37.740 --> 48:40.368
I mean, I really get it.

48:41.910 --> 48:42.956
You love him, right?

48:43.290 --> 48:47.579
Despite everything, and it's crazy,
but you love him.

48:50.050 --> 48:50.869
I do.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.671
Even though he hurt you so bad.

49:05.940 --> 49:07.476
You know, Jessica, if there's...

49:09.400 --> 49:11.777
If there's anything
you ever wanna talk about...

49:14.700 --> 49:17.237
Sometimes I think
if Hannah would have come to me,

49:20.080 --> 49:21.991
maybe things would have been different.

49:24.960 --> 49:27.702
Maybe it was too painful for her
to talk about it.

49:31.550 --> 49:34.087
Maybe she kept it all in
to protect herself.

49:37.550 --> 49:39.177
I'm not good at that.

49:40.470 --> 49:44.634
The more I think about it,
she was really brave.

49:45.060 --> 49:48.689
Oh, but, honey,
we both know that didn't work.

49:49.520 --> 49:50.646
Keeping it in,

49:52.110 --> 49:53.179
that's not brave.

49:53.780 --> 49:56.408
Feeling the pain, facing it...

49:57.910 --> 49:59.366
that takes courage.

49:59.700 --> 50:01.361
It's okay to let it out.

50:05.960 --> 50:06.995
It's okay.

50:11.420 --> 50:12.296
[sobs]

50:20.430 --> 50:22.716
[Olivia] Not a day passes
during this trial...

50:23.140 --> 50:24.050
It's okay.

50:24.140 --> 50:26.096
...in the months it took to get here

50:26.180 --> 50:29.559
that I don't wish I could have wrapped
my arms around her

50:29.650 --> 50:31.561
and told her it would be okay.

50:32.770 --> 50:34.351
But I never had that chance.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.390
Why didn't you tell us he was on drugs?

50:38.240 --> 50:39.901
He was getting better, okay?

50:40.530 --> 50:43.158
Anyway, I didn't even know about the drugs
when I first brought him here.

50:43.240 --> 50:45.242
-Should we call social services?
-No. Dad!

50:45.330 --> 50:48.538
Call social services, he disappears
into the system, he doesn't testify.

50:48.620 --> 50:50.030
Jesus, is that what we care about?

50:50.130 --> 50:52.030
No, I care about keeping the kids safe,

50:52.130 --> 50:54.246
which is hard to do
when they're both fighting us.

50:54.340 --> 50:56.968
-How am I fighting you?
-The Register called me today, Clay.

50:57.050 --> 50:58.870
Those audio files were watermarked.

50:59.090 --> 51:00.717
You stole them from my computer.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.631
You told me you weren't working
on the case.

51:02.850 --> 51:04.841
-That's no excuse.
-You told Sonya.

51:05.180 --> 51:07.592
About Zach texting Hannah.
That's how they knew everything.

51:07.850 --> 51:08.726
Is that true?

51:08.810 --> 51:11.517
She's a colleague.
I pointed her in a direction.

51:11.610 --> 51:13.726
-It's hardly the same thing.
-It's worse.

51:13.820 --> 51:17.028
You endangered my job,
my license, our livelihood.

51:17.110 --> 51:18.236
You ruined my fucking life!

51:18.320 --> 51:21.483
Jesus, you sound like children.
And there's just one child here.

51:21.570 --> 51:24.983
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Clay needs us to be his parents now.

51:25.080 --> 51:27.537
-I don't need anything from you guys.
-Clay, go to your room.

51:27.620 --> 51:28.450
What?

51:29.160 --> 51:31.537
-How is that fair?
-Go to your goddamn room!

51:32.040 --> 51:32.995
Now!

51:38.420 --> 51:40.752
[Matt] Enough is enough.
This family will not be destroyed.

51:40.840 --> 51:44.003
Not for any case, not for any other
parents' kid, not by drugs.

51:44.100 --> 51:46.842
We will not let this happen.
I get it, you're mad.

51:46.930 --> 51:49.012
I'm mad at him, too, but he is a child!

51:55.520 --> 51:58.489
[Olivia] How can you fix something
if you don't know what's broken?

52:00.860 --> 52:02.157
Hannah didn't tell us.

52:05.950 --> 52:06.780
[Hannah] Clay.

52:10.750 --> 52:11.569
No.

52:13.290 --> 52:16.168
You don't talk.
You don't get to say anything.

52:16.500 --> 52:20.163
This is your fucking fault, Hannah.
This mess started with you.

52:20.260 --> 52:23.923
I put out the tapes, and that was stupid,
but you made them.

52:24.640 --> 52:26.676
-You fucked up people's lives!
-I know.

52:27.060 --> 52:29.096
-I'm sorry.
-Are you?

52:30.060 --> 52:31.129
Are you sorry?

52:31.230 --> 52:34.188
That doesn't do a fucking bit of good
because you are gone!

52:34.730 --> 52:38.439
You killed yourself
and you didn't fucking care.

52:38.530 --> 52:41.101
-I did!
-No, or you never would've done it.

52:41.360 --> 52:45.273
I was hurting,
and I didn't think about who I might hurt.

52:45.370 --> 52:47.656
You did an evil thing.

52:52.870 --> 52:53.916
Get the fuck out.

52:59.800 --> 53:01.506
["Watch Me Bleed" plays]

53:12.560 --> 53:15.802
Heaven comes to he who waits

53:18.650 --> 53:21.892

53:24.070 --> 53:27.028
And all the deeds of yesterday

53:27.120 --> 53:30.283
Have really helped to pave my way

53:30.740 --> 53:33.709
Though there's no one near me now

53:36.750 --> 53:38.991
How come everyone can touch me

53:39.090 --> 53:39.954
Hi, Mom.

53:42.130 --> 53:47.966
You see the torture on my brow
Relates to neither here nor now

53:48.510 --> 53:51.058
Watch me bleed

54:03.610 --> 54:06.773
But still the hate lives in my mind

54:09.570 --> 54:12.539
I'll make no noise
I'll hide my pain

54:12.620 --> 54:15.703
I'll close my eyes
I won't complain

54:15.790 --> 54:18.497
I'll lie right back
And take the blame

54:18.580 --> 54:24.621
And try to tell myself I'm living
And when it's all been said or done
