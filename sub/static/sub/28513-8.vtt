01:11.987 --> 01:13.152
Jonas.

01:13.154 --> 01:14.854
That room of yours is a mess.

01:14.856 --> 01:16.656
I'm in the middle of my lesson.

01:16.658 --> 01:19.258
- It's been over an hour.
- N-No, it hasn't.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.094
Don't sass me.

01:21.096 --> 01:24.530
No justice in this world. None at all.

01:28.103 --> 01:29.402
How you been?

01:29.404 --> 01:31.871
Still angry.

01:31.873 --> 01:33.539
Sorry to hear that.

01:43.550 --> 01:46.719
Something wrong? At home?

01:46.721 --> 01:49.622
Now you want to hear about my life?

01:49.624 --> 01:52.024
I was unkind last week.

01:52.026 --> 01:54.259
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.

01:54.261 --> 01:56.561
No. Really. I'm sorry.

02:04.972 --> 02:08.039
My son came home covered
in blood last night.

02:09.208 --> 02:11.909
U-Uh... the older one?

02:11.911 --> 02:13.244
Charles.

02:13.246 --> 02:14.712
Whose blood?

02:18.118 --> 02:20.084
You know, I-I think it might be safer

02:20.086 --> 02:21.986
to do this sort of
thing back at my place.

02:21.988 --> 02:24.822
What is it with men?

02:24.824 --> 02:26.257
Exactly how do you mean that?

02:26.259 --> 02:29.127
Well, y'all want to control everything.

02:29.129 --> 02:31.929
And if you can't
control it, you shoot it.

02:31.931 --> 02:33.931
Well, now, I never shot anybody.

02:33.933 --> 02:36.333
I-I never even thought about it.

02:36.335 --> 02:38.335
Well, you're a rarity.

02:44.810 --> 02:46.310
You know, I hear talk.

02:48.414 --> 02:51.615
What really happened
to the García family?

02:51.617 --> 02:53.817
Don't ask me about all that.

02:53.819 --> 02:55.786
You own their land now.

02:58.157 --> 03:00.357
I own nothing.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.661
You could always leave.

03:03.663 --> 03:05.962
Where would I go?

03:05.964 --> 03:07.665
Would I run away?

03:07.667 --> 03:08.932
With you?

03:11.604 --> 03:14.638
Don't look scared.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.174
My place is here with my kids.

03:26.351 --> 03:29.052
- You know, I really do have a lesson...
- I don't care.

03:57.882 --> 04:00.182
Oh, Jesus!

04:00.184 --> 04:03.018
Jeannie!

04:03.020 --> 04:05.020
Honey, where are you?!

04:06.724 --> 04:09.024
Jeannie!

04:50.821 --> 04:52.346
May I offer you gents a drink?

04:53.482 --> 04:55.149
Mm. Get yourself a glass.

04:55.151 --> 04:56.684
The sheriff's on duty.

04:58.555 --> 05:00.354
Uh...

05:04.326 --> 05:07.861
What are we raising our cups to today?

05:07.863 --> 05:09.262
Friendship.

05:10.899 --> 05:13.934
I was wrong to cut you loose.

05:13.936 --> 05:18.271
I allowed the love
for my son to blind me

05:18.273 --> 05:20.540
as to who my real friends are.

05:21.777 --> 05:23.276
I regret that.

05:24.713 --> 05:26.880
And I ask for your forgiveness.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.551
So that's how it is.

05:31.553 --> 05:36.746
You've come here to reacquire
the love of a lost friend.

05:36.749 --> 05:38.015
That I have.

05:39.521 --> 05:43.622
A man of more cynical bent
might see it differently.

05:43.625 --> 05:45.863
Such a man might say that you're trying

05:45.866 --> 05:50.235
to remove a dangerous enemy
from the playing field.

05:50.237 --> 05:51.737
Such a man might suggest

05:51.739 --> 05:54.873
that you underestimated
ol' Niles Gilbert.

05:56.276 --> 06:00.378
I'll give you one-sixteenth
straight off the top.

06:00.380 --> 06:02.881
Everything that comes
out of the García land.

06:02.883 --> 06:05.283
Oh. Oh-oh.

06:05.285 --> 06:07.152
That is audacious.

06:08.589 --> 06:12.791
That's quite a fortune
you're proposing, Colonel.

06:12.793 --> 06:14.559
Tell me, Sheriff,

06:14.561 --> 06:17.495
do you know what
one-sixteenth of zero is?

06:18.766 --> 06:20.132
No.

06:20.135 --> 06:23.703
I guess your kind
don't get schooled much.

06:23.706 --> 06:28.810
See, in the end, you're
gonna lose that land.

06:28.813 --> 06:30.111
You think so?

06:30.114 --> 06:32.782
You're going up against Roy Endicott.

06:32.785 --> 06:34.618
He's one of the titans.

06:34.621 --> 06:36.120
He's right up there, boy,

06:36.123 --> 06:39.759
alongside the Rockefeller and Doheny.

06:39.762 --> 06:44.756
Whereas you, sir, are a novelty act.

06:44.758 --> 06:47.592
A costume pony show.

06:47.594 --> 06:50.094
Well, now...

06:50.096 --> 06:52.330
you're the one underestimating me.

06:52.332 --> 06:54.832
Regardless...

06:54.834 --> 06:57.059
I've chosen a side.

06:58.771 --> 07:01.339
I intend to see it through to the end.

07:02.741 --> 07:05.443
Stop jackassing around, Niles.

07:05.445 --> 07:07.178
Now tell me where she is,

07:07.180 --> 07:10.481
or I swear I'll beat
the truth out of you.

07:10.483 --> 07:13.484
Say the word, Colonel.
It'll be my pleasure.

07:14.988 --> 07:18.856
As terrifying as that prospect may be,

07:18.858 --> 07:21.192
it won't work...

07:21.194 --> 07:23.094
as I do not know.

07:33.171 --> 07:37.474
But even if I did, I would not tell you.

07:38.843 --> 07:41.444
Your treatment of
those below your station

07:41.446 --> 07:44.514
portends a hard fall to come.

07:48.353 --> 07:50.153
The bottle is on the house.

07:53.358 --> 07:55.658
You go drink it someplace else.

08:15.179 --> 08:17.513
How'd it go?

08:17.515 --> 08:21.150
Well... pretty much like we thought.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.819
The Pinkertons can have a
dozen men here by Tuesday.

08:23.821 --> 08:25.922
Tuesday's too late.

08:25.924 --> 08:28.724
The minute Monahan fails to check in,

08:28.726 --> 08:30.725
Roy Endicott will come for us.

08:32.229 --> 08:34.356
We got to get to Maria García first.

08:36.067 --> 08:38.267
Niles knows where she is.

08:38.269 --> 08:42.504
We'll just wait him
out, see where he goes.

08:42.506 --> 08:44.773
And if he gets between us and the girl?

08:46.444 --> 08:48.343
Do what feels right.

09:06.563 --> 09:07.862
'Scuse me.

09:07.864 --> 09:10.131
You from around here?

09:10.133 --> 09:12.266
I seem to have gotten
myself good and lost.

09:13.870 --> 09:15.322
Where you trying to get to?

09:15.325 --> 09:17.559
Well, I'm trying to find the
main road to San Antonio...

09:18.742 --> 09:20.541
...but I can't seem to wind around

09:20.543 --> 09:22.376
these enormous damn ranches.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.146
Judson Merrill.

09:27.117 --> 09:28.617
Jeanne Anne McCullough.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.987
I heard the stories about
what happens to trespassers

09:31.989 --> 09:34.255
who take wrong turns in these parts.

09:36.593 --> 09:37.993
Those ain't just stories.

09:42.064 --> 09:43.430
What's in San Antonio?

09:43.432 --> 09:44.898
Uh, I'm a salesman,

09:44.900 --> 09:47.141
and I have an appointment
there tomorrow.

09:49.338 --> 09:52.572
So, do... do you know
your way around this place?

09:52.574 --> 09:54.975
It's called McCullough Springs.

09:54.977 --> 09:56.944
Oh, so they named it after you, then?

09:56.946 --> 09:59.179
They named it after my grandaddy.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.749
That makes you the queen, then.

10:01.751 --> 10:05.185
I'm just saying, it looks
like you might have airs.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.520
I do not have airs.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.189
There they are, coming up already.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.424
So, tell me, Your Royalness, what...

10:11.426 --> 10:14.294
what is it like living in a
town that's got your name on it?

10:14.296 --> 10:16.129
It's fine.

10:17.599 --> 10:20.033
No, you don't like it.

10:20.035 --> 10:22.469
Come on. Admit it.

10:22.471 --> 10:24.943
What do you hate about
living in a place like this?

10:28.477 --> 10:30.644
I got a family full of liars.

10:32.281 --> 10:35.448
Families. Yeah.

10:35.450 --> 10:37.317
You live here your whole life?

10:37.319 --> 10:39.018
Since I was born.

10:39.020 --> 10:42.055
You never wanted to see anything else?

10:42.057 --> 10:45.958
Well, I-I've wanted to. Sure.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.859
Just haven't had much of a chance.

10:47.861 --> 10:50.962
Well... what's keeping you here?

10:50.964 --> 10:51.997
You married?

10:53.701 --> 10:56.235
What? My cousin was about
17 when she got married.

10:56.237 --> 10:57.960
Figure that's about how old you are.

11:00.208 --> 11:02.474
Well, I'm not married.

11:02.476 --> 11:04.310
Yet.

11:07.348 --> 11:09.181
What about you?

11:09.183 --> 11:11.016
Where's your wife live?

11:13.321 --> 11:15.921
You don't miss a thing,
do you, Jeanne Anne?

11:19.527 --> 11:22.360
Some of these, uh, smaller towns

11:22.362 --> 11:24.429
only respect a family man.

11:26.065 --> 11:28.032
Oh, so you're not married.

11:28.034 --> 11:30.167
Almost was, once.

11:30.169 --> 11:33.338
Evelyn Wheeler.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.106
But, uh, I had to establish my career.

11:35.108 --> 11:38.443
I had to improve my prospects.

11:38.445 --> 11:40.545
What happened to her?

11:40.547 --> 11:43.114
She up and married my cousin.

11:43.116 --> 11:45.516
Probably for the best.

11:47.086 --> 11:50.255
Hey. Where are you
going after San Antonio?

11:50.257 --> 11:52.357
Waxahachie and then on to Fort Worth.

11:54.093 --> 11:55.793
Take me to Fort Worth,

11:55.795 --> 11:57.794
and I'll show you the way out of here.

11:59.298 --> 12:03.267
Queenie, you got yourself a deal.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.564
_

12:48.762 --> 12:49.888
_

12:50.514 --> 12:52.641
_

12:53.485 --> 12:55.974
_

12:56.061 --> 12:58.115
_

13:01.014 --> 13:03.998
We won't last through winter.

13:04.001 --> 13:05.983
_

13:05.985 --> 13:09.853
We can join with them,
head west instead of north.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.522
Did you tell that to Toshaway?

13:13.025 --> 13:16.659
I tried. Doesn't want to hear it.

13:16.661 --> 13:19.095
Not from me, anyway.

13:19.097 --> 13:21.164
Fathers and sons fight.

13:22.534 --> 13:26.002
Not like this. This is different.

13:26.004 --> 13:29.372
He hasn't talked to me since
we left the Yaparuhka camp.

13:29.374 --> 13:33.176
He's... He's just being... stupid.

13:34.779 --> 13:36.012
He's right.

13:37.282 --> 13:38.415
I have no excuse.

13:40.289 --> 13:42.685
A Lotta good people died because
of what me and Ingrid did.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.956
Not you. Just her.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.210
_

13:50.213 --> 13:52.547
- I can hear you.
- Good!

13:57.772 --> 13:59.711
_

14:01.372 --> 14:03.606
You should talk to him.

14:58.550 --> 14:59.759
_

15:00.686 --> 15:02.002
_

15:02.396 --> 15:06.360
_

15:07.888 --> 15:10.611
_

15:11.238 --> 15:12.717
_

15:14.116 --> 15:15.701
_

15:16.410 --> 15:17.995
_

15:18.783 --> 15:21.224
_

15:22.666 --> 15:23.792
_

15:26.086 --> 15:27.470
_

15:28.422 --> 15:30.549
_

15:32.426 --> 15:37.777
_

19:15.832 --> 19:18.132
He's turning around.

19:22.205 --> 19:23.538
Hyah!

19:23.540 --> 19:25.206
Sheriff.

19:33.449 --> 19:35.483
Get around 'em!

19:38.020 --> 19:39.653
You pieces of shit!

19:39.655 --> 19:42.523
Mind that phraseology, boy.

19:42.525 --> 19:44.725
I'll make you eat that badge.

19:48.664 --> 19:51.632
You're making a mistake, Niles.

19:51.634 --> 19:53.534
I was saddened to hear
about your troubles

19:53.536 --> 19:56.336
in Austin, Phineas.

19:56.338 --> 19:58.338
Back when we were an
independent republic,

19:58.340 --> 20:01.875
do you know what the
penalty for sodomy was?

20:06.749 --> 20:09.082
Thank the Lord.

20:09.084 --> 20:11.418
We live in enlightened times.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.854
Good day, gentlemen.

20:19.327 --> 20:21.361
Hyah!

20:29.571 --> 20:31.771
Jeannie's missing.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.474
She ran off this afternoon.
Have you seen her?

20:34.476 --> 20:36.242
Not since this morning.

20:36.244 --> 20:37.743
Maybe she's with Pete.

20:37.745 --> 20:40.280
He hasn't been around. He
was out of the house early.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.914
Jeannie knows this land.

20:41.916 --> 20:44.451
Hell, she knows it better
than most of the hands.

20:44.453 --> 20:45.952
It's almost dark.

20:47.822 --> 20:49.789
She'll be back, Sal.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.824
What if she's not thinking straight?

20:54.128 --> 20:57.262
Do you have reason to think
she might not want to come home?

21:01.069 --> 21:03.435
All right. Let's go.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.427
The injunction is going to continue.

21:31.098 --> 21:33.999
I'm not running away.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.669
Once Endicott's men get here,
we'll hit back at your father.

21:39.873 --> 21:41.305
You know that, right?

21:42.876 --> 21:45.944
This won't get any easier for you.

21:45.946 --> 21:47.211
It'll get worse.

21:49.116 --> 21:51.983
It's gonna hurt your entire family.

21:51.985 --> 21:54.052
Like my brother.

21:54.054 --> 21:55.620
What about him?

21:58.124 --> 22:01.125
Monahan said you were the one
who told him about Phineas...

22:01.127 --> 22:02.459
and his inclinations.

22:05.831 --> 22:07.064
Yes.

22:08.634 --> 22:12.169
I suggested Monahan look into
your brother's private life.

22:12.171 --> 22:14.171
You ruined him.

22:14.173 --> 22:16.006
You know that, right?

22:16.008 --> 22:17.875
He's still breathing, isn't he?

22:20.913 --> 22:22.713
Come on, Peter.

22:24.917 --> 22:29.153
If you haven't noticed,
I'm fighting a war.

22:29.155 --> 22:32.689
If you can't handle this fight,
get out now. I don't want you.

22:32.691 --> 22:34.090
I'm not going anywhere.

22:34.092 --> 22:36.059
I wish I believed that.

22:36.061 --> 22:38.928
- What?
- In the end, you'll leave me.

22:38.930 --> 22:40.863
God damn you.

22:40.865 --> 22:43.233
Last summer, I publicly
denounced my father.

22:43.235 --> 22:45.101
I called him a thief and a cheat.

22:45.103 --> 22:47.204
And then I took up arms against him.

22:47.206 --> 22:50.773
I fought alongside your
family against my own.

22:50.775 --> 22:53.443
I saved your life.

22:53.445 --> 22:56.045
You betrayed me in Mexico.

22:56.047 --> 22:57.714
I forgave you.

22:57.716 --> 23:00.049
I'm standing here right now with you.

23:00.051 --> 23:03.886
You're hiding me in the woods
while you lie to your family.

23:03.888 --> 23:06.523
- Do you want a parade for that?
- I'm doing the best I can.

23:06.525 --> 23:08.107
This is not even your cabin.

23:08.110 --> 23:09.675
All you're doing here is stalling...

23:09.678 --> 23:10.893
I'm guarding, not stalling!

23:10.895 --> 23:12.294
...waiting for somebody
else to take action...

23:12.296 --> 23:14.063
I've taken plenty of
action on your behalf.

23:14.065 --> 23:16.432
...so you can do what you always
do and avoid taking a side!

23:16.434 --> 23:19.568
I'm not! I chose! I
chose you! I wanted you!

24:01.245 --> 24:04.346
Jeannie?!

24:04.348 --> 24:07.149
Jeanne Anne!

24:07.151 --> 24:08.984
Jeannie!

24:10.656 --> 24:13.323
Jeanne Anne!

24:16.427 --> 24:18.660
You need to tell me what happened.

24:21.298 --> 24:23.464
This is not the time
for keeping secrets.

24:25.368 --> 24:28.103
Just...

24:28.105 --> 24:31.339
She saw me with the piano teacher.

24:31.341 --> 24:34.309
Aw, Jesus, Sal.

24:34.311 --> 24:36.377
Do not judge me.

24:36.379 --> 24:37.779
Jeannie!

24:37.781 --> 24:40.882
There's nothing to be
done about past mistakes.

24:40.884 --> 24:43.051
We need to fix what's in front of us.

24:43.053 --> 24:44.119
Fix this family.

24:44.121 --> 24:45.287
Jeanne Anne!

24:45.289 --> 24:47.823
What family? Eli, we're coming apart.

24:47.825 --> 24:49.858
Nobody can stand talking to each other.

24:49.860 --> 24:51.693
My son is coming home covered in blood.

24:51.695 --> 24:53.795
And Maria García's
coming to take everything.

24:53.797 --> 24:56.831
Maria García is going to be dead.

24:56.833 --> 24:58.232
Very soon.

25:00.092 --> 25:01.168
What?

25:01.170 --> 25:02.804
Pete will come home.

25:02.806 --> 25:04.806
And this family will abide.

25:07.176 --> 25:12.580
If you do anything to hurt
her, you know he won't stay.

25:12.582 --> 25:14.849
You have to know.

25:14.851 --> 25:17.184
He will stay.

25:17.186 --> 25:19.186
But only if you and I work together.

25:22.024 --> 25:24.492
Can I count on you?

25:24.494 --> 25:26.059
Can I, Sal?

25:27.863 --> 25:31.097
Let's find my daughter.

25:31.099 --> 25:32.599
Jeannie!

25:35.203 --> 25:38.705
So, what you gonna do
when we get to Fort Worth?

25:38.707 --> 25:42.041
I don't know. Haven't decided yet.

25:42.043 --> 25:45.211
Queenie, I think you
ought to do some traveling.

25:45.213 --> 25:46.747
Think so?

25:46.749 --> 25:49.383
It's the only thing I
actually like about the job.

25:49.385 --> 25:54.020
See, most people got to
stay tied down, but I'm free.

25:54.022 --> 25:57.357
I can go anywhere.

25:57.359 --> 26:00.760
Where's the one place
you want to go most?

26:00.762 --> 26:02.395
Mm...

26:02.397 --> 26:03.963
I've always wanted to see Wyoming.

26:05.633 --> 26:08.067
Wyoming?

26:08.069 --> 26:09.302
Yeah.

26:09.304 --> 26:11.137
What? They have grasslands out there

26:11.139 --> 26:13.239
that go on forever, big as the ocean.

26:13.241 --> 26:15.474
Wyoming.

26:15.476 --> 26:17.443
You got the whole world at your feet,

26:17.445 --> 26:19.212
and you want to go to the one place

26:19.214 --> 26:21.414
that looks exactly like Texas.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.245
Slow down a bit.

26:53.247 --> 26:56.148
You look beautiful in the moonlight.

26:56.150 --> 26:57.482
- I'm serious.
- Shh.

26:57.484 --> 26:59.251
Shh. Shh. Shh.

27:01.755 --> 27:02.988
Stop!

27:04.925 --> 27:07.191
Little Queenie's just
itching to spread her legs,

27:07.193 --> 27:09.260
but no, not for me.

27:09.262 --> 27:12.096
That right?

27:12.098 --> 27:16.600
Are you waiting for some
prince, not some stewpot salesman

27:16.602 --> 27:18.269
who sleeps in his truck every night

27:18.271 --> 27:21.005
with shit to show for it?

27:21.007 --> 27:22.840
Doesn't matter how hard you scrap...

27:22.842 --> 27:25.642
the world's gonna tear you down.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.379
Tore down my daddy.

27:28.381 --> 27:31.648
He couldn't even feed us.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.719
Rich girl like you just wouldn't get it.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.888
All the chances in the world.

27:49.916 --> 27:50.910
Stop.

27:50.913 --> 27:52.179
Stop!

27:52.278 --> 27:53.470
Stop!

27:57.675 --> 28:00.410
You bitch tease!

28:00.412 --> 28:01.738
Bitch!

28:20.969 --> 28:23.437
Ingrid.

28:23.439 --> 28:25.672
Ingrid.

28:32.781 --> 28:33.859
Come on.

28:36.619 --> 28:39.585
Come on. Come on. Lean on me.

28:42.123 --> 28:44.156
Eli!

28:44.158 --> 28:45.491
Eli, help!

28:48.275 --> 28:49.994
Help!

29:00.441 --> 29:03.207
_

29:17.992 --> 29:19.524
I'm sorry.

29:21.195 --> 29:23.962
I'm sorry!

29:33.307 --> 29:35.874
She stopped bleeding.

29:35.876 --> 29:38.410
That's good, Tiehteti.

29:38.412 --> 29:40.578
And the wound's not that bad.

29:40.580 --> 29:42.714
She's very lucky.

29:44.542 --> 29:46.074
What about the baby?

29:49.112 --> 29:50.879
I don't know.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.958
You should rest.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.494
I had a dream about her.

30:33.493 --> 30:38.591
_

30:41.841 --> 30:45.308
I want to teach her how to ride.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.943
She'll learn how to ride.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.646
Men taught me how to ride.

30:51.116 --> 30:55.118
I want to be the one to teach her.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.819
You're a terrible rider.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.755
Better than you.

31:07.265 --> 31:09.199
I know her name.

31:12.247 --> 31:14.548
Sokobi.

31:14.551 --> 31:16.985
S...

31:16.988 --> 31:18.154
"Land"?

31:21.040 --> 31:23.103
_

31:26.484 --> 31:28.385
What was your mother's name?

31:31.122 --> 31:33.355
It's not good to talk about this.

31:33.357 --> 31:35.958
- It's not our way.
- No. I want to know.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.200
Her name was Natalia.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.971
Natalia.

31:52.710 --> 31:55.210
Tell me a story about your mother.

31:58.215 --> 32:00.830
She had this hymn book.

32:00.833 --> 32:05.299
And every night after dinner,
she would let Lizzie pick one,

32:05.302 --> 32:07.502
and they would sing it.

32:07.505 --> 32:08.837
Lizzie?

32:11.600 --> 32:13.701
She was my sister.

32:17.100 --> 32:20.001
Sing me one of her hymns.

32:20.003 --> 32:23.739
It's been too long.
I can't remember now.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.680
My mother...

32:28.883 --> 32:31.150
...she taught me a song.

32:34.785 --> 32:37.952
When we lived with the Penatekas.

32:37.954 --> 32:40.856
She used to sing it
so I could go to sleep.

Prairie Flower?

34:36.569 --> 34:38.212
_

34:40.474 --> 34:41.706
Wake up!

34:43.610 --> 34:44.976
Please!

35:46.387 --> 35:47.886
Ilsa Midkiff called.

35:47.888 --> 35:49.988
Miss Jeannie showed
up at their doorstep.

35:49.990 --> 35:51.790
They are driving her home now.

35:53.327 --> 35:55.627
She's been gone all night.

35:57.831 --> 35:58.897
But she's okay?

35:58.899 --> 36:00.465
Sí. Sí.

36:00.467 --> 36:01.833
Where's the Colonel?

36:01.835 --> 36:03.501
He and Mrs. Sally went out searching.

36:03.503 --> 36:05.985
Gus went to go fetch them.

36:05.988 --> 36:08.455
Inez.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.058
Have you seen Pete?

36:20.420 --> 36:21.719
I'll do it.

36:26.927 --> 36:28.560
Do what?

36:31.230 --> 36:33.431
They both told me they bribed
Judge Thaddeus Killborne

36:33.433 --> 36:37.168
to falsify your daddy's tax records.

36:37.170 --> 36:39.504
It's true, and I'll say that under oath.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.113
You wouldn't be able to go home again.

36:50.951 --> 36:52.716
No.

36:52.718 --> 36:53.784
I wouldn't.

36:59.391 --> 37:01.859
Did this happen because
you wanted me to testify?

37:08.233 --> 37:09.766
I don't know.

37:28.887 --> 37:31.721
Thank God you're okay.

37:31.723 --> 37:34.304
Oh, my. Thank God.

37:34.307 --> 37:35.506
Oh!

37:35.509 --> 37:37.326
Honey.

37:37.329 --> 37:41.264
Don't ever scare me like that again.

37:41.266 --> 37:42.499
I'm sorry.

37:48.740 --> 37:50.806
Jeanne Anne McCullough.

37:53.678 --> 37:55.245
I'm an old man.

37:57.282 --> 37:58.648
No, you're not.

37:58.650 --> 38:00.917
It's true.

38:00.919 --> 38:03.486
As old as the hills.

38:03.489 --> 38:07.791
I don't mind most days,
but I heard you'd gone...

38:09.761 --> 38:12.528
...I felt every minute of my age.
