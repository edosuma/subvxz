WEBVTT

00:11.245 --> 00:12.311
Previously on "Claws"...

00:12.313 --> 00:13.979
We set the Coombses
up to be killed.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.714
No, we set them up
to go to jail.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.117
Listen, You guys, we didn't know any
of this was gonna happen, okay?

00:18.119 --> 00:19.318
But it did.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.320
Okay, and now Jenn
has to live with the fact

00:21.322 --> 00:24.256
that her husband is a murderer.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.158
He killed my foster parents.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.761
Okay, but Jenn doesn't know that.
Right.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.829
And she better never find out.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.331
How is your boyfriend, Desna?

00:33.034 --> 00:34.700
His name is Roller, right?

00:34.702 --> 00:36.068
I didn't know you knew him.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.636
Look, listen to me.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.271
You gotta go to your art show.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.874
I shall go to Art South Beach,

00:41.876 --> 00:44.877
Mr. Emerson,
with you as my muse.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.312
Miss Honeychurch, I...

00:48.382 --> 00:51.250
Des! What?

00:51.252 --> 00:52.017
Shit.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.819
Detective Arlene Branch.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.254
Nice to meet you.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.955
That's those realestate people?

00:56.957 --> 00:58.290
Why'd you do that?

00:58.292 --> 00:59.958
They... they hurt me
when I was little.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.194
Desna said one day
karma was gonna get them,

01:02.196 --> 01:03.796
and karma did.

01:09.470 --> 01:14.640
Clay... Bryce is doing
a wonderful job

01:14.642 --> 01:15.941
running the clinic,

01:15.943 --> 01:17.643
and... and Toby
can launder your money

01:17.645 --> 01:19.578
through my old salon.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.414
All I ask is that you let me out

01:22.416 --> 01:24.049
to run the new one.

01:24.051 --> 01:28.120
Dear Lord,
please give Uncle Daddy

01:28.122 --> 01:30.556
grace and wisdom to say yes.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.057
And if he doesn't,

01:32.059 --> 01:35.761
toss his crazy redneck ass
into a pit of fire.

01:35.763 --> 01:39.064
Des... Des, III need your help.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.899
My... The answer is yes.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.468
You need to put some clothes on.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.636
No, my... my performance piece
at Art South Beach

01:44.638 --> 01:45.904
dictates that I be nude,

01:45.906 --> 01:47.739
and... and so
I need to know if my body

01:47.741 --> 01:49.308
is up to artistic standards.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.511
Are my pectorals symmetrical?
Your what?

01:52.513 --> 01:53.679
Des, my chest.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.614
But... Yes, Dean, it's fine.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.783
It... It's fine? Yes, now
put some clothes on.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.818
Yeah, no. What about my glutes?

01:59.820 --> 02:02.654
Yes, all your shit is poppin',
now cover it up!

02:02.656 --> 02:04.356
Okay, okay.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.791
Are you all packed
for your trip?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.192
Yeah, I won't be needing you

02:07.194 --> 02:08.660
to drive me
to my performance piece

02:08.662 --> 02:11.029
because II'm gonna go with
my girlfriend, Virginia.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.132
Your what? She's not your...

02:13.134 --> 02:14.867
Dean!

02:16.237 --> 02:17.503
Dean!

02:20.241 --> 02:22.875
Hey.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.276
I made waffles.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.344
Sorry, what?

02:25.346 --> 02:26.879
You heard me. I made waffles.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.981
I can't. Yeah?

02:28.983 --> 02:30.883
I think you can.

02:30.885 --> 02:31.950
Come on. You think I can?

02:31.952 --> 02:33.285
I think you can. You do?

02:33.287 --> 02:34.052
Come on.

02:34.054 --> 02:36.588
I think you could...

02:36.590 --> 02:38.423
stay home today,

02:38.425 --> 02:40.392
and I'll drop the kids off
at Wanda's,

02:40.394 --> 02:42.794
and we can go see a movie
or something.

02:43.564 --> 02:44.530
I can't.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.098
Why?

02:46.100 --> 02:48.133
I got a job.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.968
Baby, you know you need a break

02:49.970 --> 02:51.837
from all that Uncle Daddy shit.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.706
I know I do. And you do, too.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.642
I gotta go.

02:56.644 --> 02:59.378
He's got some heavy hitters

02:59.380 --> 03:01.947
coming down to check out
the pill operation.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.716
Why don't we go out
this weekend?

03:04.718 --> 03:07.853
Seriously, I'll take you
to that place you like, and...

03:07.855 --> 03:09.988
Jenn, come on, okay?

03:09.990 --> 03:13.025
What does it matter
what day we see a movie?

03:13.027 --> 03:14.927
It's not about the movie.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.962
It's about us losing each other,

03:16.964 --> 03:18.897
and you not giving a shit.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.938
Have a nice day.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.923 --> 03:44.423
Thank you.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.857
Stop me right before

03:45.859 --> 03:47.059
I strangle the stupid
out of Miss Thang.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.560
Right before.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.598
What the hell is wrong with you?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.732
What? What's the problem?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.033
You told Dean

03:55.035 --> 03:56.168
you would go with him
to South Beach?

03:56.170 --> 03:57.569
I love South Beach.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.805
He thinks you're his girlfriend,
dumbdumb.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.773
That's so sweet.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.575
No, it's not sweet.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.943
It's dangerous.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.245
Dean is innocent,

04:06.247 --> 04:07.779
and you could break his heart.

04:07.781 --> 04:08.947
Okay, I'll make it clear

04:08.949 --> 04:10.949
we're only going as friends.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.252
I know he has issues, girl,
but dang.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.487
You don't know what he has,
little girl.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.555
What you gonna do

04:16.557 --> 04:18.190
if he stops
in the middle of the street

04:18.192 --> 04:20.192
to draw the "20% off" sign
from Bed, Bath, and Beyond?

04:20.194 --> 04:22.761
Get your damn hand off your hip
when I'm talking to you!

04:22.763 --> 04:25.397
What you gonna do if he's balled
up in a knot on the ground

04:25.399 --> 04:27.666
'cause people keep bumping
into him on the sidewalk?

04:27.668 --> 04:29.501
I think he's capable of
a lot more than you do.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.503
Maybe you need to let him
off his leash or something.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.273
Let me tell you what
about... Okay, okay!

04:34.275 --> 04:36.475
All right, let's go
outside and enjoy the sun

04:36.477 --> 04:38.310
on what may be
your last day on earth.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.544
I got you. This little bitch.

04:39.546 --> 04:42.814
Come here. Have a seat.
Have a seat.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.049
Have a seat.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.350
Where's Jenn?

04:45.352 --> 04:47.319
She called in sick again?

04:47.321 --> 04:49.288
I can't...

04:49.290 --> 04:52.424
I'm not gonna make it, Ann.
I'm not gonna make it.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.626
<i>The revelations
that Keith and Sandy Coombs</i>

04:54.628 --> 04:56.295
<i>were drug dealers
continues to shock</i>

04:56.297 --> 04:58.096
<i>many in their
affluent community.</i>

04:58.098 --> 05:01.266
<i>The police continue to search
for clues into their murder.</i>

05:01.268 --> 05:02.601
<i>The Coombs had been known</i>

05:02.603 --> 05:04.403
<i>as successful realestate agents</i>

05:04.405 --> 05:07.706
<i>who had just relocated

05:46.880 --> 05:49.815
Hello? Hey.

05:56.423 --> 05:57.889
Dean's here. Gotta go.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.792
All right.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.060
Hi, Dean.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.730
Hey, Virginia.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.964
This is yours.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.199
That's beautiful.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.800
III made it myself.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.669
- Thank you.
- Dean?

06:10.671 --> 06:12.037
Yeah. Come here.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.473
Come right here and
listen to me, okay? Okay.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.274
I want you to make sure
you keep your phone charged

06:16.276 --> 06:18.910
so that I can reach you
at all times.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.412
Okay. You understand?

06:20.414 --> 06:22.748
I do not want you giving money
to homeless people.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.082
Look at me.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.717
Even if they have a dog
that looks sad.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.153
And don't wander off
after strangers, baby,

06:28.155 --> 06:30.856
who... who have a funny
scifi tshirt on.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.391
OOOkay, Desna, okay.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.792
II'll take that.
Thank you, Dean.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.194
I just want you to be safe.
Okay.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.430
You, Rainbow Brite.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.464
Three rules.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.298
Number one,

06:40.300 --> 06:41.533
you make sure you tell him

06:41.535 --> 06:43.869
that you are not his girlfriend.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.537
Number two, you do not lose him.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.073
Number three,
you don't lose him.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.208
You got that? Okay.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.978
You are gonna sleep in this,

06:52.980 --> 06:55.080
period, point, blank,
end of story.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.581
He has the same urges
as any man,

06:56.583 --> 06:59.618
and I don't want him tempted
by your kibbles and bits.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.653
Okay. I got this.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.088
You can trust me, Des.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.023
I'll take good care of him.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.126
See you later, bye. Okay, okay.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.394
Bye, ladies.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.062
You ready, Dean? Yeah.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.431
Okay.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.231
Dean?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.200
Yeah? I love you, okay?

07:15.202 --> 07:16.535
Okay, okay, Desna.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.104
IIIII'll get you
a souvenir, Des,

07:19.106 --> 07:20.305
that... that... that showcases

07:20.307 --> 07:21.540
the... the local flavor of S...

07:21.542 --> 07:23.074
Of the South Beach area, okay?

07:23.076 --> 07:25.010
Okay? Okay.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.379
Keep your phone charged.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.547
Okay.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.355
He's gonna be okay.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.624
I spent my whole life
raising him,

07:39.626 --> 07:42.894
and he picks Gang Bang Wang
as his first girlfriend.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.030
I agree Virginia's not ideal,

07:45.032 --> 07:46.898
you know,
being a half idiot and all,

07:46.900 --> 07:48.099
but you have got to remember,

07:48.101 --> 07:50.802
you did a great job
raising Dean.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.070
You did.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.572
And we will
beat her ass to death

07:53.574 --> 07:55.440
if anything bad happens to him.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.142
Truth.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.176
We got you.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.711
Hey, Polly.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.179
What the...?

08:01.181 --> 08:03.748
Hey, Marnie,
what's the haps, girl?

08:03.750 --> 08:04.816
What's going on?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.151
My mom got busted,

08:06.153 --> 08:08.887
and Slick
ghosted to Jacksonville.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.188
DCF was sniffing around

08:10.190 --> 08:12.290
to toss me
into foster care, so...

08:12.292 --> 08:14.326
I was wondering
if you could drive me

08:14.328 --> 08:15.794
to the bus station.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.163
Slick said he could find me
some dates.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.603
Yeah, yeah, girl.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.239
Well, let's go. Are you hungry?

08:27.241 --> 08:29.708
Come on, I'll get you
something to eat.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.311
No, no, no!

08:33.313 --> 08:34.645
I can't! I can't do it!

08:34.648 --> 08:36.681
I can't go to Art South Beach.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.283
Yes, you can.
You're doing great, Baby G.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.818
Eye on the prize.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.419
No, the critics will destroy me.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.321
Please, let's go back
in the house. No!

08:43.323 --> 08:45.323
No.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.192
Listen to me,
we're gonna take this car,

08:47.194 --> 08:49.294
we're gonna hit the road,
get out of this swamp,

08:49.296 --> 08:50.662
go to Art South Beach... Okay.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.430
And we're gonna
show these critics

08:52.432 --> 08:53.732
what it is and what it will be.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.166
Let's go.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.302
Here, take... take these
for the road.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.871
It'll help you sleep. Why you gotta
keep thinking I'm gonna run.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.207
It's a long drive, baby.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.542
How I'm gonna keep
that kitty purring

09:03.544 --> 09:04.876
if this tongue is dozin'?

09:04.878 --> 09:07.312
I love you more than
the moon and the stars,

09:07.314 --> 09:10.215
but if you try to leave me,
I will put you down.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.619
Come on.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.863
Okay.

09:31.805 --> 09:35.173
So, you know,
I'm getting my new salon,

09:35.175 --> 09:37.576
and it got me
thinking about my career.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.711
You ever thought about
having a career?

09:39.713 --> 09:41.112
You mean besides water ballet?

09:41.114 --> 09:42.914
That's more of a hobby.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.951
I saw those amazing miniatures
you paint for Juanda

09:45.953 --> 09:47.018
when you do her nails,

09:47.020 --> 09:48.320
and these?

09:48.322 --> 09:49.821
Honey.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.290
You know my whole crew
is going over to Glint,

09:52.292 --> 09:53.658
and, I was thinking

09:53.660 --> 09:56.227
maybe you wanted to run
Nail Artisans?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.797
Desna, you're...
You're too sweet,

09:58.799 --> 10:01.333
but, um, no.

10:01.335 --> 10:02.634
No, running the salon

10:02.636 --> 10:04.402
would mean too much time
away from Uncle Daddy.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.004
Come on, you know Clay.

10:06.006 --> 10:10.408
He's a man of big appetites
and a wandering eye.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.210
Okay, I happen to know

10:12.212 --> 10:14.145
that this himbo act is bullshit.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.647
You graduated magna cum laude

10:15.649 --> 10:17.515
from Brandenton Community,
right?

10:17.517 --> 10:20.385
If all you are to Uncle Daddy
is a piece of ass,

10:20.387 --> 10:22.921
you right,
he <i> is</i> gonna get bored.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.389
I don't know.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.859
Well, you remember
that Liberace movie,

10:27.861 --> 10:29.094
the one where Matt Damon

10:29.096 --> 10:31.296
did all that shit to look like
Michael Douglas,

10:31.298 --> 10:33.431
and in the end,
he still threw him out

10:33.433 --> 10:35.367
like a piece of white trash,

10:35.369 --> 10:36.935
If you run the salon,

10:36.937 --> 10:39.504
you will have
Uncle Daddy's respect.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.272
There'll be no dropping.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.742
Well...

10:43.744 --> 10:45.377
it always has been
a dream of mine

10:45.379 --> 10:46.845
to make people beautiful.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.380
Right.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.415
Let's do it.

10:50.417 --> 10:53.852
Toby leanin' in! Yes!

10:53.854 --> 10:56.721
So, the most important thing
in running Artisans

10:56.723 --> 10:58.623
is that you want
to make the money look legit

10:58.625 --> 11:00.892
coming out of Uncle Daddy's
pill clinic. Right.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.394
You gotta get
somebody you trust.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.195
Jenn is that person for me.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.064
She's with me everywhere I go.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.533
Well, not lately 'cause she called
in sick a couple days, but...

11:08.535 --> 11:09.801
She didn't look sick
this morning

11:09.803 --> 11:11.736
when I saw her drop the kids off
with Juanda.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.538
What?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.940
Her car was fill of bags
from Fendi and Gucci.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.878
Don't let me spill the tea.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.255
In my next life, Lord,

11:30.257 --> 11:32.791
let me come back
as a white hillbilly.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.869
Jenn? Are you in?

11:45.939 --> 11:48.473
Can you hear me?

11:48.475 --> 11:50.875
I'm worried about you.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.844
Well, I...

11:52.846 --> 11:55.947
Jenn, open the door if
you can hear me.

11:57.584 --> 12:01.019
Open the door,
or I'll open it with my car!

12:35.355 --> 12:36.621
What are you doing here?

12:36.623 --> 12:38.189
Can I talk to her for a minute?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.691
Yeah, of course.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.096
What do you want?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.898
What is going on?

12:46.900 --> 12:49.601
I mean,
Hank is cool and all that,

12:49.603 --> 12:51.736
but you're a married woman.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.571
This is a dosidon't.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.240
Well, what I do
and who I do it with

12:55.242 --> 12:56.307
is none of your business.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.609
It's absolutely my business

12:57.611 --> 12:59.677
when I'm the one
taking over your clients

12:59.679 --> 13:01.513
'cause you keep
calling out sick.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.515
What... what's going on?

13:03.517 --> 13:06.151
Shit's been real stressful
around here lately.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.485
Well...

13:07.487 --> 13:09.521
Wait, is something going on
with Bryce?

13:09.523 --> 13:11.689
You mean other than him
murdering people?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.626
I'm sorry.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.262
I know that that has to be hard,

13:17.264 --> 13:19.230
but Glint is about to open,

13:19.232 --> 13:20.999
and I need you by my side.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.335
You know what?
The only thing that doesn't suck

13:24.337 --> 13:25.737
about Bryce
working at the clinic

13:25.739 --> 13:27.906
is all that money's
he's pulling down.

13:27.908 --> 13:32.110
I don't even
have to work anymore.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.079
You're saying you quit?

13:36.283 --> 13:37.482
Come on.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.716
Maybe you just need some time.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.151
I don't. I'm done.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.260
Okay.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.177
Before my mom met Slick,
she had this regular

14:06.179 --> 14:07.378
who used take us
to the water show

14:07.380 --> 14:08.513
in time to watch the mermaids.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.881
They were amazing.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.816
They do all these tricks
with their tails.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.151
I got this autograph
from this one,

14:13.153 --> 14:14.285
and she said
I could be a mermaid.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.154
That would be so sick.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.489
It looks so peaceful.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.460
Girl, you can be
whatever you want to be.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.828
Not likely.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.330
I have this thing
where I get water up my nose

14:25.332 --> 14:26.564
when I go underwater.
No, no, no...

14:26.566 --> 14:28.733
Ladies, may I join you?

14:28.735 --> 14:30.068
Sure.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.803
Marnie, this is Dr. Ken.

14:31.805 --> 14:33.872
Dr. Ken, this is Marnie,
my neighbor.

14:33.874 --> 14:37.141
Well, any friend of fair Polly's

14:37.143 --> 14:39.210
is a friend of mine. Aww.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.416
Anybody want any water?

14:45.418 --> 14:46.985
No, thank you. Ice?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.557
Thanks, sugar.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.759
You should totally smash that.

14:54.761 --> 14:58.263
My mom said doctors
make the perfect husbands.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.398
Lots of cash
and too tired to screw.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.599
No, no, no, no.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.868
I'm working on my career
these days.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.037
Thanks for lunch.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.039
Can you take me
to the bus station now?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.374
Um...

15:09.376 --> 15:11.276
you know,
until your mom makes bail,

15:11.278 --> 15:12.644
and all this shit,

15:12.646 --> 15:14.445
I was thinking maybe, you know,

15:14.447 --> 15:16.414
you could...
You could hang with me.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.716
Really? Yeah.

15:21.655 --> 15:23.388
Yeah, I don't have a car,

15:23.390 --> 15:25.857
so I'm gonna have to, like,
walk you to the bus and stuff.

15:25.859 --> 15:27.425
Hey. You smoke?

15:28.194 --> 15:30.762
Yes, little mermaid.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.408
The event manager at
the, Palmetto Surf Hall

15:43.410 --> 15:45.310
is not a dependable man!

15:45.312 --> 15:47.011
That's a... that's a shame.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.614
Had my anniversary party
there tonight,

15:49.616 --> 15:51.249
and renew
with my sweet angel Juanda,

15:51.251 --> 15:53.918
he has a little fire
and cancels the whole shebang!

15:53.920 --> 15:55.186
Happy anniversary.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.622
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.191
Did I tell you boys
to cessate that activity?

16:00.193 --> 16:01.559
I believe I did!

16:01.561 --> 16:04.128
I need this shit
like a frog needs titties.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.068
I know some people
who do events.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.438
If, if I help you out
with the party,

16:13.440 --> 16:15.173
ccan we maybe talk later?

16:16.676 --> 16:19.410
My goodness, Miss Desna.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.512
I would be forever in your debt.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.381
Money is...
Is of course, no object.

16:23.383 --> 16:27.318
And the theme
is "Gone with the Wind."

16:37.030 --> 16:40.698
My God, this is fantastic, too.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.467
You're gonna make
an incredible wife.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.973
So, where'd you learn
to cook like that?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.442
No, answer the question.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.978
No.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.048
I've told you
everything about me.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.551
You know I almost got fired
for getting a DUI,

17:00.553 --> 17:01.719
I hate ketchup,

17:01.721 --> 17:02.920
I had my first orgasm

17:02.922 --> 17:05.089
to AnnMargret
in "Bye Bye Birdie."

17:05.090 --> 17:07.759
And you've told me nothing.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.993
Where are you from?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.400
Do you have
any brothers or sisters?

17:17.203 --> 17:19.404
What were you like in high school?
Why?

17:19.406 --> 17:20.872
Because if this
is gonna go anywhere,

17:20.874 --> 17:22.406
II need to know more about you

17:22.409 --> 17:24.075
than how you like
your pussy licked.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.083
I was born here.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.624
Brother... nerd.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.729
Thank you.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.741
The secret
to selling this much Oxy

17:56.743 --> 18:00.278
is looking legit
to law enforcement...

18:00.280 --> 18:01.879
The three L's.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.949
Our MRI truck
is central to that.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.551
Yeah, 'cause I mean,
you take anybody

18:06.553 --> 18:07.852
and twist 'em right, all right?

18:07.854 --> 18:09.687
They look tweaked enough
that they need pills.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.390
So when the DEA comes in,
you show 'em the picture,

18:12.392 --> 18:13.691
and you say, "Suck a dick."

18:13.693 --> 18:15.660
Well,
since I got Emma Watson here

18:15.662 --> 18:17.562
for my emotional support,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.997
I flushed all my anxiety pills.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.333
She's a beautiful animal.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.939
So, what do you think?

18:29.943 --> 18:31.008
Hey, Clay.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.810
Excuse me,
I don't mean to interrupt,

18:32.812 --> 18:34.512
but I just wanted
to let you know

18:34.514 --> 18:36.547
that me and my girls
are working really hard.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.516
We got entertainment, food,

18:38.518 --> 18:39.917
and a line on a perfect venue

18:39.919 --> 18:41.219
for your party tonight.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.753
You're a miracle worker.

18:42.755 --> 18:43.721
Miss Desna! Ha ha!

18:43.723 --> 18:45.022
Boys, this is Miss Desna.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.757
Miss Desna, these are
my business associates,

18:46.759 --> 18:48.359
Lamont and this is Circus.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.961
Miss Desna here,

18:49.963 --> 18:51.796
she's a... she's an integral
part of our operation.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.364
You know, we, marshal our cash

18:53.366 --> 18:54.665
through her nail salon.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.335
If we come in
on this here expansion,

18:57.337 --> 18:58.870
II'd like you to come

18:58.872 --> 19:00.738
and show me
all the ins and outs.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.673
Whatever you need.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.575
Miss Desna's gonna be
at the party tonight.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.097
Actually, the girls... No, you're
gonna be at the party tonight.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.883
Boys, let's go check out
the new place, all right?

19:11.885 --> 19:13.645
It's an old firehouse,
still got the pole up.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.891
Dean! D...

19:21.361 --> 19:22.660
I'm sorry. Are you mad?

19:22.662 --> 19:23.928
No. Sorry.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.663
I'm gonna be with you
at the show, okay?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.365
Hey, beautiful!

19:27.367 --> 19:30.134
So if you start to feel like
you're going to freak out... Yeah.

19:30.136 --> 19:33.037
You look right at me.
You want to party with us?

19:33.039 --> 19:36.674
Just pretend
it's you and me, okay?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.843
Okay, just you and me.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.244
What kind of brain damage
I gotta get

19:40.246 --> 19:42.113
to get a tightass
lil' nurse like you?

19:42.115 --> 19:43.948
Is this your man?

19:43.950 --> 19:46.317
It looks like you're the one
full up on brain damage.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.785
I understand.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.288
Sexual frustration,
it can drive a honey crazy.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.455
Can you go?

19:51.457 --> 19:52.657
Geez, what a bitch.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.791
You... you have to apologize!

19:53.793 --> 19:54.992
No, no, no, wait, Dean.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.294
No, no, you're... you're a lady,

19:56.296 --> 19:58.496
and... and... and you're
being disrespectful.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.018
You... you have to apologize right now!
That's not gonna happen.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.501
My God! You have to
apologize to her!

20:03.503 --> 20:04.835
Dean, we have to go. My God.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.337
Dean, come on, we have to go.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.406
We... we gotta go, come on.
II... Virginia.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.507
I'm back!

20:09.509 --> 20:10.575
Desna, ready for the party?

20:10.577 --> 20:12.476
Y'all come on in.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.812
Whoaho!

20:14.814 --> 20:16.080
Don't you clean up nice.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.949
Twirl around,
let me get a load of you.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.885
Not you, Ann.
I'm talking to the baby.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.521
Polly got it for me.
Did she, now?

20:26.459 --> 20:27.592
Hey.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.127
Yeah, I'll take the call.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.862
Hi, mom.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.364
Yeah. I'm good.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.536
Ooh, Casablanca lilies.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.838
Dr. Ruval knows his flowers.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.340
Yes, he does.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.608
Roller's idea of romance

20:43.610 --> 20:45.876
was biting my neck
after he came.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.846
This is your time, girl.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.282
<i>If</i> Uncle Daddy lets me out.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.416
Will he, though?

20:52.418 --> 20:54.685
Hopefully this party'll
put him in a good mood.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.820
It's now or never.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.889
Hey, Bryce, come on.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.127
What's up?

21:03.129 --> 21:07.498
Um, Jenn wanted me
to give these back to you.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.100
She said she's not coming back.

21:09.102 --> 21:12.169
She couldn't give them to me
herself?

21:12.972 --> 21:15.673
I'm just the messenger.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.545
Ladies.

21:21.547 --> 21:22.647
Bye, Bryce.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.617
She's had a difficult life, Des,

21:26.619 --> 21:28.552
you know that
better than anyone.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.254
We all know what it's like

21:30.256 --> 21:33.824
to have trouble accepting
that we deserve good things.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.527
Mnhmnh, this is not
the same thing, Pol.

21:36.529 --> 21:39.864
I have wanted a place like Glint
my whole life.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.098
How could I do this

21:41.100 --> 21:43.601
without people around me
that I trust?

21:43.603 --> 21:45.369
Des.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.138
I...

22:07.627 --> 22:10.227
Roller is alive.

22:10.229 --> 22:11.462
He's not here.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.364
Find him.

22:21.074 --> 22:23.040
All right, baby,
time to join the herd

22:23.042 --> 22:25.176
and have some apple toddies
with your people.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.911
Mr. Emerson,
I have missed this world.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.446
Yes, let's.

22:28.448 --> 22:31.382
You know, I can't do anything
with my wings clipped.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.818
Lord, here.

22:35.288 --> 22:37.054
- I can't believe she came back.
- Is that her?

22:37.056 --> 22:39.023
- She looks crazy.
- No!

22:41.227 --> 22:42.226
They're here.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.894
Who dat? The critics.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.529
Plotting against me,
I know they are.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.598
Pay them bitches no mind, come on.
No, no, no.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.133
They're here to destroy me.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.068
Listen to me. Listen. You...
You... you're here to consecrate

22:51.070 --> 22:52.370
your return
back to your throne, babe.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.438
No, no, we have to go.
We have to go.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.674
No, no, no, You didn't call
that pussy here for nothing.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.008
We here to consecrate

22:58.010 --> 22:59.610
your return back to your throne.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.011
No, no.!

23:01.013 --> 23:02.847
Let's go over there
and talk yourself.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.917
Thank you for sticking up
for me earlier.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.619
No one's ever done that before.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.055
Well, that's what boyfriends do.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.594
Ready to go in? Yeah.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.762
Okay.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.902
Listen. Yeah.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.670
You can do this. Yeah.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.839
We'll do it together, okay?

23:28.841 --> 23:30.074
Yeah. You'll be fine.

23:33.679 --> 23:36.647
<i>You are not worthy,
but you have been chosen.</i>

23:36.649 --> 23:40.651
<i>Today, you will be transformed
from flesh and blood</i>

23:40.653 --> 23:42.420
into the most
metaphoric art piece.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.121
South Beach has ever known.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.657
May I see your lines, please?

23:46.659 --> 23:48.192
Go. Yeah.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.428
<i>Front left,
right here, thank you.</i>

23:53.232 --> 23:54.732
<i>Please reveal my canvases.</i>

24:05.778 --> 24:07.378
What is your name, child?

24:07.380 --> 24:09.713
That's impressive. Dean.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.048
You can do it.

24:11.984 --> 24:15.352
Everyone, behold my star, Dean.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.701
What's got you so tickled,
Clay Husser?

24:32.438 --> 24:35.506
You look as happy as a puppy
with two peckers.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.475
It looks like Lamont and Circus

24:37.477 --> 24:41.645
might throw in
on our clinic expansion.

24:41.647 --> 24:46.016
Baby boy Bryce will press
the tar out of those boys.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.651
Can you believe
it's been 30 years

24:47.653 --> 24:50.221
since we said our I do's?

24:50.223 --> 24:52.122
Seems like we're
the only couple we know

24:52.124 --> 24:54.158
that's gone the distance.

24:55.061 --> 24:58.229
Well, you know the secret
to a great marriage.

24:58.231 --> 25:00.231
Picking the right woman.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.033
Virginia?

25:36.035 --> 25:37.468
Are... are you mad at me?

25:38.404 --> 25:40.271
No. Why would you think that?

25:40.273 --> 25:42.106
Well, because you've been quiet,

25:42.108 --> 25:44.441
and quiet means mad,
or... or quite means shy,

25:44.443 --> 25:46.076
but you're... you're not shy,

25:46.078 --> 25:47.678
so your quiet must mean mad.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.179
No, I'm not mad.

25:49.181 --> 25:52.383
Here, come sit with me.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.185
Okay.

25:56.689 --> 25:57.988
I...

26:04.096 --> 26:05.362
Was that okay?

26:05.364 --> 26:06.630
Yeah.

26:06.632 --> 26:09.600
IIII'd be interested
in doing more of it.

26:09.602 --> 26:10.901
Okay.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.636
Yeah. Go ahead.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.372
Okay.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.416
What do I do now?

26:26.719 --> 26:28.118
What do you want to do?

26:36.996 --> 26:38.329
It's okay.

26:38.331 --> 26:39.563
Okay.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.554
They invited me here
to destroy me.

27:03.556 --> 27:06.190
The critics are part
of the Deep State.

27:06.192 --> 27:09.126
They're all part of it!

27:09.128 --> 27:12.062
You're part of it, too.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.331
You made me come here.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.799
Come on, baby.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.368
Hotel art!

27:19.205 --> 27:20.671
Baby, it's just
a little bit of nerves.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.139
Everybody gets a little nervous.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.974
Shit, I'm nervous.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.509
I'm a fool...

27:25.511 --> 27:28.345
Baby, put the gun... for
loving you so... so much.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.081
Mr. Emerson, our bloody bodies

27:31.083 --> 27:34.551
will be my magnum opus.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.588
Baby, stop. Listen to me.

27:37.590 --> 27:40.591
You're gonna make every one
who disrespected you repent.

27:40.593 --> 27:43.594
All right, when you reveal
that masterpiece, okay?

27:43.596 --> 27:46.263
You're gonna make
a pussy hair tsunami

27:46.265 --> 27:49.133
and make those
jealous hoass artists...

27:49.135 --> 27:50.668
When you reveal
that masterpiece...

27:50.670 --> 27:52.436
They'll be choked,
they'll be whipped.

27:52.438 --> 27:53.937
They're gonna wanna
be violated, baby.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.105
That's it.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.609
Okay?

27:59.545 --> 28:00.878
Say you want to change.

28:02.882 --> 28:06.283
Move to the side.
Move to the side.

28:06.285 --> 28:07.284
Yeah, babe.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.720
Yeah! Yeah!

28:14.260 --> 28:16.427
I finished it for you.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.595
Thank you.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.135
You're a special person, Dean.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.904
I'm on the autism spectrum.

28:26.906 --> 28:30.374
That's...
That's not what I meant..

28:30.376 --> 28:34.745
What I meant was,
you're a good person.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.948
And I had sex with you

28:37.950 --> 28:39.750
because I care about you,

28:39.752 --> 28:42.853
and I wanted your first time
to be special.

28:45.858 --> 28:50.561
And... I know this might not
be easy to understand,

28:50.563 --> 28:53.831
but at this point in my life,

28:53.833 --> 28:55.866
I'm not looking for a boyfriend.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.001
Yeah, II understand.

28:58.003 --> 28:59.503
Yeah? Yeah.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.804
Okay.

29:00.806 --> 29:02.773
It would be weird for you
to look for a boyfriend

29:02.775 --> 29:04.308
when you have me.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.155
Hey, hey, hey,
make sure you tell them

29:18.157 --> 29:19.757
to keep these oysters on ice.

29:19.759 --> 29:22.326
If Uncle Daddy gets
a whiff of a bad oyster,

29:22.328 --> 29:24.595
somebody gonna lose body parts.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.098
You lost.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.633
I'm gonna tell you right now,

29:29.635 --> 29:31.835
somebody ask me to birth a baby,

29:31.837 --> 29:33.403
they gettin' cut.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.440
Hell no.

29:40.146 --> 29:42.646
No, ma'am. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

29:42.648 --> 29:44.515
Keeping you from being stupid.

29:44.517 --> 29:45.983
Who do you think you are?

29:45.985 --> 29:47.284
You're not my mama.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.852
I used to wish you were my mama,

29:48.854 --> 29:50.487
but my mama was just a whore.

29:50.489 --> 29:51.688
You're a murderer.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.525
Jenn.

29:54.527 --> 29:56.293
The Coombses
were your foster parents.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.896
I saw a picture in Dean's room.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.764
Bryce didn't avenge
Roller's death.

30:00.766 --> 30:03.100
He killed those two people
because of you.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.039
Yeah, really good.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.741
I need to talk to you.

30:10.743 --> 30:13.310
Boys, you know my boy's gal,
Jenn, right?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.245
You okay, darling?

30:15.247 --> 30:18.949
No, I'm not okay. Hey,
how is, everybody doing?

30:18.951 --> 30:19.917
We're doing good.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.451
Jenn here is just gonna tell us

30:21.453 --> 30:22.719
what was bothering her.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.458
Never mind.

30:37.069 --> 30:40.003
Get off me!

30:41.040 --> 30:43.073
Please, let me explain.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.441
You were my best friend,

30:44.443 --> 30:46.577
and you destroyed my family
to save yourself.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.111
I only wanted
the Coombses arrested.

30:48.113 --> 30:50.681
Yeah, well, Roller's dead,
and Bryce is a murderer.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.217
He is gonna be haunted
by killing those people

30:53.219 --> 30:54.451
for the rest of his life,

30:54.453 --> 30:56.720
and what about my girls?

30:56.722 --> 30:58.822
You're the only one who hasn't
paid a price for what you did!

30:58.824 --> 31:01.725
If you tell Uncle Daddy or Bryce
any of this, Jenn,

31:01.727 --> 31:03.560
they will kill her on the spot!

31:03.562 --> 31:06.630
Well, maybe I will,
or maybe I'll do it myself!

31:06.632 --> 31:08.432
What is wrong with you?

31:08.434 --> 31:09.800
- No, no, no!
- Listen.

31:09.802 --> 31:12.603
I know you're upset,
but we are a family!

31:12.605 --> 31:14.071
We love each other!

31:14.073 --> 31:15.572
We are all we have!

31:20.346 --> 31:21.746
Y'all really think
she'll tell them?

31:27.152 --> 31:29.987
Before you came into my life,
I was an empty vessel.

31:29.989 --> 31:36.526
I am not worthy of the love
that you fill me with.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.397
You are my life.

31:48.841 --> 31:51.074
Let's hear it for this
inspirational couple, everybody,

31:51.076 --> 31:53.410
mom and daddy. Thank y'all.

31:54.647 --> 31:57.981
I didn't say anything to you
about Roller and the Coombses

31:57.983 --> 32:00.550
'cause I didn't want you
caught up in all this mess.

32:00.552 --> 32:03.420
You need something
taken care of,

32:03.422 --> 32:05.255
you come to me.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.359
That's what I'm here for.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.365
Now, the days of billboard ads
are over, all right?

32:15.367 --> 32:16.967
Digital outreach has given us

32:16.969 --> 32:20.070
a younger, more affluent
patient pool, right?

32:20.072 --> 32:21.338
I'm so proud of my boy,

32:21.340 --> 32:23.073
talkin' all business and shit.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.943
My business is up 40%

32:25.945 --> 32:28.178
since this man was in charge,
you know that?

32:28.180 --> 32:29.713
This... This brain right here

32:29.715 --> 32:31.915
is... is a moneymaking machine.

32:31.917 --> 32:33.884
Brains are all well and dandy,

32:33.886 --> 32:36.053
but the reason
we're investing in these clinics

32:36.055 --> 32:39.556
is know Bryce here
can drop a body when need be.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.826
- Hell yeah, he can.
- Nice work on them Coombses.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.861
Your boy Chip sent me
the crimescene photos.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.530
Easy now, easy now,
put that away.

32:46.532 --> 32:47.898
- Put that away.
- All right.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.466
Nothing like seeing
the spark of life

32:49.468 --> 32:50.734
leaving the son of bitch's eyes.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.336
Yeah.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.603
All right, let's toast.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.771
Let's toast to this deal here.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.206
Come on now.
To our new business idea.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.442
We are bad. We are nationwide.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.711
- Nationwide.
- Nationwide.

33:02.047 --> 33:03.313
Whoo!

33:04.917 --> 33:07.317
You lookin' a little pekid, boy.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.019
Here you go. I, see...

33:09.021 --> 33:11.254
No, he's good.
I'll hit that turtle, though.

33:11.256 --> 33:12.489
Give me that.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.894
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Whoo!

33:17.896 --> 33:20.364
Boys from Georgia
got some good shit right there.

33:24.737 --> 33:26.870
I remember you liked crab cakes,

33:26.872 --> 33:28.805
so I grabbed some
before the Confederate Army

33:28.807 --> 33:30.607
ate them all.
Why, thank you, Ken.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.977
What a good person.

33:33.979 --> 33:36.747
Look at the motor on Dr. Ken.

33:36.749 --> 33:39.082
I've been taking dance lessons..

33:42.354 --> 33:44.321
Shit. Um, can you hold that?

33:44.323 --> 33:45.756
Excuse me for a moment.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.761
Hey, Jenn is drinking,
go find Desi.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.429
Shit.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.498
What are you doing?

33:55.134 --> 33:57.367
No... nothing.
I'm just taking...

33:57.369 --> 33:59.603
just taking the edge off,
you know,

33:59.605 --> 34:02.606
because of the... the, um...

34:02.608 --> 34:04.341
'Cause of me, the Georgia guys

34:04.343 --> 34:06.176
are coming in
on the new clinics,

34:06.178 --> 34:08.110
so I thought
I deserved a reward.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.413
Said the crackhead.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.049
To the alcoholic.

34:12.051 --> 34:14.784
I get you a big house,

34:14.786 --> 34:16.420
more money
than you ever dreamed of,

34:16.422 --> 34:18.088
and you're treating Desna
like shit?

34:18.090 --> 34:19.623
What's your problem?

34:21.994 --> 34:23.226
Desna killed Roller.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.362
She set up the Coombses
to take the fall,

34:25.364 --> 34:26.897
and you killed the wrong people.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.234
Jenn!

34:53.792 --> 34:56.659
Big house, more money than
you could ever dream of,

34:56.661 --> 34:58.161
and you're treating Desna
like shit.

34:58.163 --> 34:59.196
What's your problem?

35:08.807 --> 35:11.341
Jenn, please,
let me just talk to you.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.742
What, Des? Listen to me.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.277
What could you possibly say?

35:14.279 --> 35:17.547
Listen, Roller kept
treating me like shit,

35:17.549 --> 35:18.849
telling me to stop asking him

35:18.851 --> 35:20.550
for the money
that he promised me,

35:20.552 --> 35:22.185
and I snapped.

35:22.187 --> 35:24.888
I can't believe you killed him.
I thought I did,

35:24.890 --> 35:26.289
and the next thing I know,

35:26.291 --> 35:28.725
he was on top of me,
beating the life out of me.

35:28.727 --> 35:31.294
And Virginia shot him
to save my life.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.231
And... and... and I knew
if Uncle Daddy found out,

35:34.233 --> 35:35.765
he would kill both of us,

35:35.767 --> 35:37.968
and he was getting closer
every day.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.536
So you just set up
two innocent people.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.105
They were monsters.

35:42.107 --> 35:43.373
Dean was...

35:43.375 --> 35:49.513
He was a sweet, weird,
innocent kid.

35:49.515 --> 35:53.083
And the shit they did to him?

35:53.085 --> 35:54.684
He let them do it to him

35:54.686 --> 35:57.220
so they wouldn't do it to me.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.456
He was protecting me,
and he didn't tell me.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.458
I didn't know. Yeah, but
after all we been through,

36:01.460 --> 36:03.260
you could have told me.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.794
You're supposed to trust me.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.663
I didn't want you to live
the rest of your life

36:06.665 --> 36:09.533
lying to Bryce over what I did.

36:09.535 --> 36:12.002
I'm sorry.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.203
I love you.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.071
Honey, please,

36:15.073 --> 36:17.908
please tell me
you can forgive me.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.011
I don't know, Des.

[ Classical music plays ]

36:30.856 --> 36:34.157
Listen, um, I got you this.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.994
It's one of those,
nose clamps, you know,

36:37.996 --> 36:40.463
'cause all
the bestdressed mermaids

36:40.465 --> 36:41.965
in Weeki Wachee
are wearin' 'em, girl,

36:41.967 --> 36:43.366
come on now.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.102
Thanks.

36:46.104 --> 36:49.072
You know I can't be a mermaid,
right?

36:50.209 --> 36:52.275
I know that life can be hard,

36:52.277 --> 36:55.045
and having a dream can pull
you through the worst of it.

36:55.047 --> 36:57.047
Is that why you pretend
to be other people?

36:57.683 --> 37:00.684
You need to remember something,

37:00.686 --> 37:02.219
when you get older,

37:02.221 --> 37:05.288
you deserve a good person

37:05.290 --> 37:07.991
who treats you
with love and respect.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.693
So do you.

37:13.532 --> 37:16.800
All right.

37:29.181 --> 37:31.681
Excuse me? Shall we?

37:50.602 --> 37:52.869
We need to recommit
to our sobriety.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.771
We've got too much to lose.

37:57.442 --> 38:00.043
We'll go to a meeting
in the morning.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.746
And I'm gonna reconnect.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.748
I'm not gonna let
all this Uncle Daddy shit

38:04.750 --> 38:06.850
get in the way of us.

38:06.852 --> 38:08.685
And, hey, you have to talk to me

38:08.687 --> 38:10.587
if you have something
you need to.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.399
Excuse me, Clay?

38:22.401 --> 38:25.302
Is now a good time
for us to talk?

38:25.304 --> 38:27.137
I mean, maybe we could...

38:29.741 --> 38:32.142
What's on your mind?

38:39.251 --> 38:41.418
You and me,

38:41.420 --> 38:45.055
we spent our whole lives
being told we were nothing,

38:45.057 --> 38:47.691
that we would never be nothing,

38:47.693 --> 38:48.992
And that we should be happy

38:48.994 --> 38:52.062
with our little piece
of nothing?

38:52.064 --> 38:55.832
We both had to scrape, fight,
and pray our way

38:55.834 --> 39:00.070
to creating better lives
for our family.

39:00.072 --> 39:00.904
You did that.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.906
And I want to do the same.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.908
I want to create a better life
for me and Dean.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.643
I just...

39:06.645 --> 39:09.479
I want to stop
washing your money.

39:10.716 --> 39:16.152
Well, if you ain't gonna do it,
who's gonna do it?

39:16.154 --> 39:17.654
Toby.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.957
You know he's got
the brains for it.

39:23.662 --> 39:25.295
Well, it would give him
something to do

39:25.297 --> 39:27.864
other than ask me how his
titties look all the time.

39:32.204 --> 39:33.837
You got it.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.475
You know, just remember that,

39:38.477 --> 39:40.877
new businesses fail
all the time,

39:40.879 --> 39:45.081
so if things don't work out,

39:45.083 --> 39:46.316
I'm here for you.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.657
Okay, okay.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.493
Just 'cause he said no this time

39:56.495 --> 39:58.661
doesn't mean that he won't
say yes the next time.

39:58.663 --> 39:59.796
That's true.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.799
I'm out.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.534
What? He let me out.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.637
Yes!

40:08.173 --> 40:11.141
Can y'all believe that? My God.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.030
Yeah.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.137
I'm scared.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.172
What are you scared of? Critics.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.808
Get up there
and demand your respect.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.211
Yeah? Yeah, cowboy
up and get it.

Um...

41:36.461 --> 41:38.027
Thank you all for coming.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.129
I'm... I'm a little nervous.

41:46.571 --> 41:49.372
Okay, um...

41:49.374 --> 41:50.540
All right, quiet!

41:52.644 --> 41:56.746
Um, using pubic hair
as my medium

41:56.748 --> 42:01.551
manifests the Earth Mother
who stands astride our culture

42:01.553 --> 42:04.320
and demands we...

42:04.322 --> 42:05.922
You know, honestly,

42:05.924 --> 42:08.191
I bet you're tired of
hearing that kind of talk.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.492
I am.

42:09.494 --> 42:11.794
I can't say that stuff anymore.

42:11.796 --> 42:16.933
Um, My name is
Gladys Coleman Pirette.

42:18.403 --> 42:20.904
the pubic hair
of incarcerated women

42:20.906 --> 42:24.007
not because it's controversial,

42:24.009 --> 42:26.242
not because it was a comment on

42:26.244 --> 42:31.247
the, patriarchy desiring
to police female sexuality,

42:31.249 --> 42:34.551
but, because
I thought it was pretty.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.320
And curly.

42:38.657 --> 42:40.256
And III liked the way

42:40.258 --> 42:43.693
that it...
It catches the light, so...

42:58.743 --> 43:00.910
I'll be right here, okay?

43:00.912 --> 43:02.211
Right here.

43:02.213 --> 43:03.379
Okay.

43:08.753 --> 43:09.852
Earth!

43:15.527 --> 43:17.360
Fire!

43:29.307 --> 43:31.674
Let the elements be at rest.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.431
Hey, I know it's late,
but I texted

43:55.433 --> 43:56.866
because I just...

44:04.442 --> 44:06.709
You did great. You did so great.

44:06.711 --> 44:08.177
I did, didn't I?

44:08.179 --> 44:10.847
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

44:20.392 --> 44:22.558
- Amazing.
- Whoa.

44:24.929 --> 44:26.095
Mr. Emerson?!

44:26.097 --> 44:27.530
I was blown away by your piece.

44:27.532 --> 44:29.966
I stand humbled. It's amazing.

44:33.938 --> 44:35.738
Can... can we go get Desi
a souvenir?

44:35.740 --> 44:37.607
Yeah, of course. Okay.

44:45.216 --> 44:46.683
My God. Shit. My God.

44:46.685 --> 44:48.918
What's the matter, Virginia?
Nothing.

44:48.920 --> 44:51.487
Look how cool
this painting is, look.

44:51.489 --> 44:52.989
It's that one?

44:57.862 --> 44:58.995
Wait, wait, wait.

44:58.997 --> 45:01.931
Just hold on, hold that thought.

45:03.568 --> 45:05.735

45:05.737 --> 45:07.036
Don't look at me like that.

45:07.038 --> 45:08.771
I'll be right back, I promise.

45:11.109 --> 45:14.010
What? And you better not
tell me you lost him.

45:14.012 --> 45:16.412

He's here at South Beach.

45:16.414 --> 45:17.947
Girl, what are you smoking?

45:17.949 --> 45:19.282
Put Dean on the damn phone.

He's here.
I can see him right now.

45:21.586 --> 45:23.953
Hey, Dean, let's go get that souvenir for
your sister. There are a lot of people.
