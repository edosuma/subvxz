00:45.770 --> 00:48.230
Daddy

00:54.560 --> 00:56.230
Daddy

00:56.810 --> 00:57.980
Tangerine

00:58.520 --> 01:00.480
Daddy

01:01.190 --> 01:02.060
Tangerine

01:44.480 --> 01:45.850
Nothing's changed

01:46.650 --> 01:47.980
As soon as my eyes close

01:48.230 --> 01:49.900
I dream about Tangerine

01:51.100 --> 01:52.600
And that city

01:53.400 --> 01:54.940
It gets more and more vivid

01:55.730 --> 01:57.350
In the city...

01:58.900 --> 02:01.020
There was a...

02:07.100 --> 02:09.229
There was a...

02:55.560 --> 02:56.520
Hold on

03:19.900 --> 03:20.770
Yu Changhai

03:31.850 --> 03:32.650
Stop

03:32.980 --> 03:33.560
Stop!

03:33.730 --> 03:34.560
Enough

03:34.770 --> 03:35.230
Stop

03:36.440 --> 03:37.350
You're killing him

03:37.350 --> 03:38.650
Stop it

03:45.520 --> 03:46.150
Look at this

03:46.810 --> 03:47.940
Look!

03:48.230 --> 03:48.940
Six years ago

03:50.020 --> 03:51.230
In Liaoyuan

03:51.900 --> 03:53.650
You kidnapped her

03:54.100 --> 03:55.190
Where is she?

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
Tell me

03:57.190 --> 03:58.310
Where?

03:58.650 --> 03:59.440
Speak!

04:09.850 --> 04:10.650
Let's move

04:14.520 --> 04:15.650
Yu Changhai

04:37.440 --> 04:38.400
Tangerine

04:41.350 --> 04:41.770
Tangerine

04:42.350 --> 04:42.940
No

04:43.480 --> 04:44.230
Not her

04:44.480 --> 04:44.770
Tangerine

04:45.100 --> 04:45.850
Tangerine

04:46.600 --> 04:47.020
Tangerine

04:47.600 --> 04:48.060
Tangerine

04:49.400 --> 04:50.020
Tangerine

04:50.600 --> 04:51.400
Not her

04:51.650 --> 04:52.560
Tangerine

04:55.150 --> 04:56.600
She's not here

05:27.060 --> 05:27.900
Arrest him!

05:27.900 --> 05:28.770
Rescue the kids!

05:45.440 --> 05:46.310
Base,

05:46.310 --> 05:47.190
this is squadron two, over

05:47.350 --> 05:48.150
Intelligence confirmed

05:48.270 --> 05:49.100
Kidnapper detained, over

05:54.730 --> 05:56.350
Little Tangerine

05:56.690 --> 05:58.600
Oh little Tangerine

05:59.520 --> 06:01.940
Soon you'll grow tall

06:04.150 --> 06:05.770
Little Tangerine

06:06.310 --> 06:08.100
Oh little Tangerine

06:08.650 --> 06:12.310
To grow pretty I must eat my fill

06:12.850 --> 06:16.810
Give me the red-braised ribs mommy made

06:16.810 --> 06:18.850
Give them to me!

06:18.850 --> 06:21.020
Nom nom, all gone

06:36.900 --> 06:37.520
Xiaoyu

06:38.690 --> 06:39.310
Tangerine

06:46.270 --> 06:47.940
Daddy

06:48.440 --> 06:49.270
Tangerine

06:49.350 --> 06:50.020
Officer Wu

06:50.440 --> 06:51.520
Are you coming back to HQ?

06:51.520 --> 06:52.150
Should we save you some dinner?

06:52.230 --> 06:52.940
Sure

06:53.150 --> 06:55.150
We're bringing the suspect back

06:55.650 --> 06:56.350
We got lucky today

06:56.350 --> 06:57.190
Picked up a big one

06:58.600 --> 06:59.520
What happened?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.310
Six kids in one van

07:02.310 --> 07:04.100
These child traffickers are crazy

07:04.440 --> 07:05.560
We'll get them all!

07:05.560 --> 07:06.480
These trafficker bastards!

07:06.480 --> 07:08.400
Okay. See you soon

07:16.270 --> 07:17.400
Give the photo back

07:18.480 --> 07:19.730
Hey, behave!

07:20.020 --> 07:21.100
Give it back!

07:21.100 --> 07:21.770
Let go

07:23.350 --> 07:24.400
What are you doing?

07:25.520 --> 07:26.520
Give me the photo!

07:26.520 --> 07:27.270
You're insane

07:27.270 --> 07:28.440
Give me the photo!

07:30.230 --> 07:31.060
Sit back

07:32.270 --> 07:33.100
Let go

07:34.900 --> 07:35.400
Let go

07:35.400 --> 07:36.060
Stop it!

07:36.310 --> 07:37.270
You prick!

07:42.310 --> 07:42.900
Open up

07:43.520 --> 07:44.230
Sit back

07:45.600 --> 07:46.400
Officer Wu

07:48.020 --> 07:48.940
Don't you dare

07:49.690 --> 07:50.350
Open the door

07:52.440 --> 07:52.980
Officer Wu

07:53.440 --> 07:54.100
The car lock

07:56.690 --> 07:57.350
Wu!He's getting away!

07:58.060 --> 07:58.900
The key is broken

08:02.600 --> 08:03.310
Freeze!

08:04.600 --> 08:05.480
Freeze!

08:23.100 --> 08:24.060
Don't overthink it

08:24.770 --> 08:26.020
You don't know me

08:26.850 --> 08:27.850
And you...

08:28.230 --> 08:30.440
You're our valued business partner

08:31.850 --> 08:32.980
You've got the wrong guy

08:33.730 --> 08:34.730
Your name's Guan Ning

08:35.440 --> 08:36.150
From Liaoyuan

08:36.559 --> 08:38.020
Used to work in a bank

08:38.440 --> 08:40.020
Six years ago your daughter went missing

08:40.190 --> 08:41.559
And you've been looking for her since

08:41.559 --> 08:42.600
Sold your house

08:42.809 --> 08:43.809
Divorced your wife

08:44.730 --> 08:45.650
Six years

08:46.270 --> 08:47.230
Nice going

08:47.730 --> 08:49.440
Anyone else would've given up ages ago

08:50.400 --> 08:51.600
You don't sleep well, do you?

08:51.900 --> 08:53.440
That's none of your business

08:54.770 --> 08:55.810
Because you don't dare sleep

08:55.810 --> 08:57.150
You're scared of having nightmares

08:57.350 --> 08:59.520
You'll dream about your daughter

08:59.730 --> 09:03.020
And a massive city

09:09.190 --> 09:10.150
Yeah

09:10.150 --> 09:11.020
You're the one

09:11.850 --> 09:12.770
Stop the car

09:13.980 --> 09:15.060
Stop the car!

09:24.940 --> 09:26.150
That's right

09:27.480 --> 09:29.150
The police are looking for you

09:29.350 --> 09:30.850
I'll go turn myself in then

09:31.400 --> 09:32.650
Everything can be explained

09:33.190 --> 09:34.520
Go back and you can clear your name

09:34.520 --> 09:37.020
But you may find your daughter if you come with me

09:40.270 --> 09:41.310
The choice is yours

09:46.650 --> 09:48.190
What did you say?

11:09.600 --> 11:10.480
Leave him alone

11:28.480 --> 11:29.480
Go west

11:29.730 --> 11:30.730
Run for your life!

11:30.940 --> 11:31.690
Sis

11:35.560 --> 11:36.310
Good boy

11:36.980 --> 11:38.190
Go

12:37.850 --> 12:38.850
Sister

12:58.900 --> 12:59.600
Sis

13:00.190 --> 13:01.770
Go west

13:02.400 --> 13:03.600
Run...

13:16.730 --> 13:17.810
Sis

13:20.600 --> 13:21.520
Sis

13:22.400 --> 13:23.690
Go

13:23.900 --> 13:25.350
Quick

13:26.900 --> 13:29.230
Do as I say

13:39.310 --> 13:42.850
By order of Lord Redmane

13:43.560 --> 13:46.600
Your heads are to be removed

13:49.520 --> 13:51.440
The dead cannot be resurrected

13:52.020 --> 13:53.150
My condolences

13:53.560 --> 13:54.730
Kid

14:01.690 --> 14:03.020
Ouch, it hurts!

14:04.480 --> 14:05.600
Come

14:07.310 --> 14:08.940
Cut off this girl's head

14:09.940 --> 14:12.060
And take me to a doctor

14:12.600 --> 14:14.690
I'll give you a good death

14:26.480 --> 14:28.150
Don't you dare kill me

14:30.650 --> 14:32.900
I bear the mark of Lord Redmane

14:55.730 --> 14:56.600
Sister

14:58.940 --> 15:00.850
We've been running for years

15:02.850 --> 15:05.060
Should I really keep running?

15:10.150 --> 15:12.440
Just listen to your sister, kid

15:17.440 --> 15:20.900
Let's see how far you get

15:31.060 --> 15:31.980
Hey!

15:34.600 --> 15:36.850
Once Lord Redmane claims your life

15:36.850 --> 15:38.980
You're as good as dead

15:39.310 --> 15:43.480
Your head will hang outside the citadel

15:44.060 --> 15:46.150
The girl will be exhumed

15:46.150 --> 15:47.940
And her head will hang with yours

15:48.150 --> 15:52.600
Knocking each other in the wind

15:52.980 --> 15:55.980
Two big round meatballs

15:58.520 --> 16:00.060
Don't even think about it

16:00.560 --> 16:04.100
He's godlike!

16:04.440 --> 16:05.940
You don't stand a chance

16:06.480 --> 16:07.310
Sis

16:07.310 --> 16:08.400
I can't keep running west

16:08.690 --> 16:10.230
I must seek justice for you

17:09.400 --> 17:11.849
That old man's blood stinks

17:11.849 --> 17:13.480
Unbearable

17:13.480 --> 17:16.020
Sent me to sleep for forty years!

17:16.400 --> 17:17.020
You're not like that

17:17.020 --> 17:18.480
No

17:19.440 --> 17:20.770
Want to scoop my eyeballs out?

17:21.310 --> 17:22.599
Don't even think about it

17:23.770 --> 17:25.400
You really are

17:25.400 --> 17:26.599
A juicy meatball!

17:26.810 --> 17:28.349
Yes, juicy and tender

17:31.480 --> 17:33.600
A mere mortal

17:34.020 --> 17:36.060
Who wants to slay a god

17:38.190 --> 17:39.350
How fascinating!

17:39.940 --> 17:41.190
Take me with you

17:41.560 --> 17:43.520
I love a bit of fun

18:04.440 --> 18:05.600
Do you see that?

18:06.270 --> 18:08.190
That's where Redmane is

18:08.900 --> 18:10.770
Go take your revenge

18:11.940 --> 18:13.150
Go

18:22.020 --> 18:23.310
Seven years ago

18:24.230 --> 18:26.350
I went across the city

18:26.730 --> 18:28.350
To eat crab meat dumplings

18:28.560 --> 18:30.520
To eat crab meat dumplings

18:30.940 --> 18:32.560
It was a two-hour drive

18:32.560 --> 18:33.770
And then I had to queue

18:33.770 --> 18:35.520
You only need one traffic jam

18:35.520 --> 18:37.480
And that's two hours

18:37.480 --> 18:38.480
Gone!

18:38.940 --> 18:39.730
Time

18:40.100 --> 18:41.480
It's so precious

18:41.900 --> 18:42.900
Time

18:43.270 --> 18:45.440
The final problem for humanity

18:46.560 --> 18:48.350
At Aladdin Group

18:48.810 --> 18:52.150
Our goal is to give you more time

18:53.020 --> 18:55.560
Today, we use the Lamp app to pay bills

18:55.850 --> 18:58.440
Play games, chat, shop

18:58.730 --> 19:02.230
You can even see a doctor or report a crime

19:03.600 --> 19:06.020
Not to mention eat dumplings

19:07.270 --> 19:10.810
In the past we took two hours to do one thing

19:10.980 --> 19:14.690
Now in two hours we can do ten things

19:15.400 --> 19:16.600
Because we are...

19:16.770 --> 19:18.520
resculpting time

19:26.650 --> 19:27.730
You can really talk shit

19:28.810 --> 19:29.850
And my daughter?

19:34.690 --> 19:36.650
I'm the CIO of Aladdin Group

19:36.810 --> 19:38.100
Chief Information Officer

19:38.520 --> 19:39.100
Tu Ling

19:39.310 --> 19:40.690
Cut the crap

19:41.150 --> 19:43.020
You said you'd help me find her

19:43.520 --> 19:44.850
We've already found her

19:56.980 --> 20:00.480
Well, maybe not found her

20:01.020 --> 20:04.100
But narrowed the search as much as possible

20:05.560 --> 20:07.310
One of these five girls

20:08.190 --> 20:09.440
Is your daughter

20:11.350 --> 20:12.600
Can you tell which?

20:25.100 --> 20:26.310
I can't

20:27.270 --> 20:29.810
Can't even recognize my own kid

20:30.310 --> 20:31.100
It's not your fault

20:31.350 --> 20:33.230
Years have passed

20:43.560 --> 20:44.650
Don't worry

20:45.100 --> 20:47.270
Once we run a DNA analysis

20:47.600 --> 20:49.440
We'll know instantly

20:50.850 --> 20:53.150
When is the DNA analysis?

21:05.400 --> 21:07.060
What will it cost me?

21:11.350 --> 21:12.810
Just in time

21:15.940 --> 21:17.060
Hi everyone

21:17.190 --> 21:19.440
Let's continue with my novel

21:20.690 --> 21:21.980
From where we left off

21:22.810 --> 21:24.100
The sister holds the blade

21:24.100 --> 21:26.060
-This is a live stream -Supporting her exhausted body

21:26.060 --> 21:26.940
Yes

21:27.850 --> 21:30.100
-She looks up at Kongwen -The novel is being streamed live

21:30.400 --> 21:32.810
The sister forces a smile

21:32.940 --> 21:33.690
Run

21:34.150 --> 21:35.520
Go west, quick...

21:35.810 --> 21:36.850
Before finishing her words

21:37.190 --> 21:38.560
A foot

21:38.560 --> 21:40.980
Kicks her onto the ground

21:41.270 --> 21:43.520
It's the old monk

21:44.480 --> 21:46.400
A black sabre in his right hand

21:46.400 --> 21:50.020
Pierces the sister's back

21:50.480 --> 21:51.730
The life

21:51.730 --> 21:53.230
Slowly leaves her face

21:56.940 --> 21:58.230
In front of Kongwen

21:58.400 --> 21:59.560
Towards the northeast

21:59.560 --> 22:01.100
Several hundred miles away

22:01.100 --> 22:03.150
A light gleams in the distance

22:04.060 --> 22:05.940
Kongwen looks towards it

22:06.480 --> 22:07.600
And sees

22:08.560 --> 22:09.520
A city?

22:10.350 --> 22:11.480
A city

22:14.350 --> 22:16.020
Sunlight shines through the clouds

22:16.270 --> 22:18.150
And envelopes the city

22:18.480 --> 22:21.270
A massive ancient citadel

22:21.520 --> 22:22.690
There it is

22:22.900 --> 22:25.600
The capital of the Ranliang Kingdom

22:26.600 --> 22:27.850
City of Clouds

22:28.350 --> 22:29.310
Your dream

22:31.230 --> 22:32.150
At that moment

22:32.400 --> 22:35.980
Up on the hill, deep within the palace

22:35.980 --> 22:39.690
Redmane felt something

22:42.980 --> 22:43.940
The Lamp app

22:44.400 --> 22:46.400
Will bring you a better life

22:46.560 --> 22:49.230
Time and distance

22:49.230 --> 22:50.520
Are no longer problems

22:50.520 --> 22:51.940
The young man's eyes

22:52.150 --> 22:53.350
Persevered

22:53.350 --> 22:54.100
Aladdin...

22:54.350 --> 22:55.520
Is by your side

22:55.850 --> 22:56.690
I...

22:57.730 --> 22:58.850
Am by your side

22:59.520 --> 23:01.690
As he gripped the blade

23:08.270 --> 23:09.480
Tightly in his hand

23:09.480 --> 23:12.230
Redmane in his hilltop palace

23:12.230 --> 23:14.730
Suddenly had a splitting headache

23:15.440 --> 23:16.850
It was an old wound

23:17.060 --> 23:20.730
Which had somehow burst open

23:23.020 --> 23:26.650
The intense pain caused his great body

23:26.650 --> 23:27.690
To tumble down

23:30.310 --> 23:31.440
What happened?

23:33.690 --> 23:34.480
Just now

23:34.480 --> 23:35.810
Aladdin Group President, Li Mu

23:35.810 --> 23:37.600
Suddenly fainted during his talk

23:37.600 --> 23:40.480
What began as a small life sciences company

23:40.480 --> 23:43.440
Has grown into dozens of sectors

23:43.440 --> 23:45.060
A large multinational conglomerate

23:45.310 --> 23:45.940
For many years

23:45.940 --> 23:48.350
Li Mu has led Aladdin's development

23:56.060 --> 23:56.900
Sir

23:59.150 --> 24:00.400
What's he writing now?

24:01.310 --> 24:02.560
The young man Kongwen

24:04.060 --> 24:05.440
Decided to go to the capital

24:05.810 --> 24:07.480
Redmane sensed it

24:08.020 --> 24:09.940
Caused his old head wound to act up

24:21.100 --> 24:22.980
Are you sure it's him?

24:22.980 --> 24:25.980
He's the only right option for me

24:26.270 --> 24:28.310
He managed to lose his own child

24:28.730 --> 24:30.230
Yet has no shame

24:31.440 --> 24:32.690
Tu Ling,

24:33.400 --> 24:34.980
Your parents abandoned you

24:35.520 --> 24:37.270
Your parents abandoned you

24:37.810 --> 24:38.980
Not Guan Ning

24:39.400 --> 24:41.980
Don't confuse personal life with work

24:42.810 --> 24:43.480
Yes, sir.

24:49.730 --> 24:51.190
What is the price?

24:53.020 --> 24:54.230
What are you willing to pay?

24:54.520 --> 24:55.690
To get your daughter back

24:55.690 --> 24:56.650
Anything

24:56.810 --> 24:57.810
Good

24:58.350 --> 24:59.350
Good

25:00.980 --> 25:02.020
You have to kill someone

25:04.190 --> 25:04.980
Kill?

25:05.310 --> 25:06.520
Just give him a push

25:07.060 --> 25:08.560
Using your special powers

25:09.730 --> 25:10.730
We've done our research

25:12.730 --> 25:14.560
You're not the only one with such powers

25:14.980 --> 25:15.980
Some feel no pain

25:16.650 --> 25:17.650
Others can produce electricity

25:19.020 --> 25:20.150
And then those like you

25:21.150 --> 25:21.980
You throw stones

25:22.600 --> 25:25.350
With unusual power and accuracy

25:25.850 --> 25:26.650
Look at that

25:28.060 --> 25:29.520
You can even change its direction

25:30.150 --> 25:32.020
Would killing someone really be so difficult?

25:33.900 --> 25:35.150
You've been spying on me

25:40.650 --> 25:43.770
Every day we sift through an ocean of information

25:44.480 --> 25:46.770
Looking for what's useful

25:48.060 --> 25:49.190
I mean

25:50.270 --> 25:51.850
How else do you think we found your daughter?

26:06.400 --> 26:08.060
Who are you going after?

26:08.940 --> 26:10.100
A novelist

26:10.600 --> 26:12.230
The novel you just heard live

26:12.480 --> 26:13.980
Is called "Godslayer"

26:13.980 --> 26:15.350
The author's name is Lu Kongwen

26:16.560 --> 26:17.730
Here's the thing

26:18.020 --> 26:19.270
My boss believes

26:19.270 --> 26:21.270
That novel is affecting his health

26:22.020 --> 26:22.940
What the heck?

26:23.230 --> 26:25.440
There's a character called Redmane

26:25.770 --> 26:27.560
Every time

26:27.810 --> 26:29.350
Redmane gets sick or hurt

26:30.230 --> 26:31.850
My boss faints like today

26:31.850 --> 26:32.980
That's the third time now

26:33.190 --> 26:36.600
We've tried every "legal" means

26:36.940 --> 26:37.900
To stop him from writing

26:38.020 --> 26:38.770
But nothing has worked

26:38.900 --> 26:40.190
And the writer has announced

26:41.310 --> 26:43.520
That he'll finish the novel in three days

26:43.520 --> 26:45.270
Given the way the plot is developing

26:47.810 --> 26:49.060
Redmane will die

26:52.900 --> 26:54.440
You're all insane

26:56.900 --> 27:00.600
Your boss fears being written to death?

27:03.020 --> 27:04.310
I know you don't believe it

27:04.600 --> 27:05.310
Do you?

27:05.730 --> 27:07.060
What matters is my boss believes it

27:10.940 --> 27:11.600
Never mind

27:12.350 --> 27:13.770
If you're not interested

27:14.270 --> 27:15.520
Then you may leave

27:27.650 --> 27:28.980
Where's the writer?

27:29.560 --> 27:30.440
In the Twin River City

27:31.150 --> 27:32.480
I'll kill him

27:32.650 --> 27:33.730
To get my girl back

27:34.690 --> 27:35.900
You only have three days

27:36.350 --> 27:37.520
If you want to find your daughter

27:37.690 --> 27:39.560
This is your last chance

27:40.980 --> 27:42.350
Record your dreams

27:42.730 --> 27:43.520
And send them to me every day

27:44.190 --> 27:45.600
Don't let us down

27:50.350 --> 27:52.600
Young Kongwen descended Sacred Wood Peak

27:53.060 --> 27:54.190
Left Mount Di

27:54.600 --> 27:56.730
And went north to the City of Clouds

27:57.600 --> 28:00.150
The first two hundred miles were hard

28:01.310 --> 28:02.810
Kongwen was travelling on foot

28:03.810 --> 28:05.650
Upon reaching the Luoshui River port

28:06.100 --> 28:08.520
He boarded a freighter bound for the capital

28:16.100 --> 28:18.310
The strange waves and water beasts

28:18.980 --> 28:20.850
Frightened Kongwen

28:21.350 --> 28:23.150
But luckily he avoided getting seasick

28:23.810 --> 28:24.940
What was to come

28:25.350 --> 28:26.770
Kongwen didn't know

28:27.730 --> 28:29.230
All he knew was

28:29.230 --> 28:31.600
That if he didn't look for Redmane

28:32.310 --> 28:33.060
Then there was no need

28:33.850 --> 28:35.190
For him to continue living

28:35.940 --> 28:37.980
Redmane

28:37.980 --> 28:40.060
Was the only soul in the world

28:40.440 --> 28:42.940
Who awaited Kongwen

28:45.100 --> 28:45.980
Redmane

28:46.600 --> 28:48.730
Could sense Kongwen's presence

28:49.440 --> 28:51.480
He remembered Kongwen's father

28:53.310 --> 28:54.940
Once a friend

28:55.520 --> 28:59.100
And the only man he ever feared

28:59.690 --> 29:00.850
Very well

29:01.940 --> 29:03.400
Thought Redmane

29:04.060 --> 29:05.190
He'd been lonely

29:05.190 --> 29:07.440
For far too long

29:23.480 --> 29:24.350
Hey Kongwen

29:24.350 --> 29:25.560
What's up?

29:26.310 --> 29:27.230
Damn kid

30:03.980 --> 30:05.270
How did he score?

30:05.270 --> 30:06.350
What were you thinking?

30:06.520 --> 30:07.400
Are you a moron?

30:07.900 --> 30:09.270
What is this?

30:13.600 --> 30:14.730
You're a grown up

30:14.940 --> 30:16.150
Pick on someone your own size!

30:17.850 --> 30:18.900
Pass it to me

30:18.900 --> 30:19.730
Come on

30:19.900 --> 30:20.690
Pass it!

30:28.900 --> 30:30.650
Time for lunch Kongwen

30:31.230 --> 30:33.060
He comes every day to scrounge food

30:33.060 --> 30:34.350
I can't stand the sight of him

30:34.350 --> 30:36.480
Almost thirty years old

30:36.480 --> 30:37.190
No job

30:37.190 --> 30:38.100
No income

30:38.480 --> 30:39.980
He's the definition of a parasite

31:56.440 --> 31:57.480
What are you looking at?

31:58.480 --> 31:59.770
Why are you following me?

32:00.060 --> 32:00.940
Huh?

32:10.190 --> 32:12.350
I saw you when I was eating lunch

32:12.810 --> 32:15.100
And when I was playing soccer

32:15.440 --> 32:17.100
Why are you following me?

32:19.850 --> 32:21.310
I'm...I'm a fan of yours

32:22.980 --> 32:24.100
A fan?

32:35.190 --> 32:36.690
You're my fan?

32:39.440 --> 32:40.690
So you followed me?

32:43.560 --> 32:44.440
Where are you from?

32:45.730 --> 32:47.270
I'm from Liaoyuan

32:47.400 --> 32:48.770
And you came all that way to see me?

32:49.440 --> 32:50.690
Don't be stupid

32:51.520 --> 32:52.270
What?

32:52.400 --> 32:53.190
How did you get here?

32:53.650 --> 32:54.190
By plane?

32:54.770 --> 32:55.230
Train?

32:55.440 --> 32:55.900
Boat

32:56.060 --> 32:56.980
Married?

32:58.150 --> 32:58.940
Divorced

32:58.940 --> 33:00.480
It takes ages by boat

33:02.900 --> 33:04.900
Which of my novels is your favorite?

33:08.060 --> 33:08.850
Godslayer

33:11.440 --> 33:12.900
Godslayer, huh?

33:16.100 --> 33:18.230
Who's your favorite character?

33:19.100 --> 33:21.560
The young Kongwen, of course

33:22.060 --> 33:24.650
So you like the Kongwen storyline better

33:29.350 --> 33:30.270
It seems

33:31.270 --> 33:32.480
The one from Baihan Fang

33:32.650 --> 33:34.230
Is not interesting enough

33:35.900 --> 33:36.600
What?

33:38.650 --> 33:39.730
What is "Beihanfeng"?

33:41.730 --> 33:43.650
I'm developing a new character

33:45.310 --> 33:46.980
Someone who's been blinded

33:47.440 --> 33:49.310
And can't see the truth

33:49.690 --> 33:52.520
But I haven't worked out how to write it

33:53.150 --> 33:54.440
Redmane

33:55.100 --> 33:58.190
Sensed Kongwen's presence

34:03.100 --> 34:03.560
Hello

34:05.190 --> 34:06.440
Why are you speaking to Kongwen?

34:07.060 --> 34:07.810
Just do your job!

34:08.560 --> 34:09.600
You're listening in?

34:09.940 --> 34:11.400
Is that strange?

34:11.400 --> 34:13.020
Of course it's strange!

34:27.730 --> 34:28.650
Stop talking to him

34:28.650 --> 34:29.520
Finish the job

34:29.730 --> 34:31.190
Stop ordering me around

34:31.600 --> 34:32.440
Tell me

34:32.810 --> 34:36.600
What does Kongwen mean by "Beihanfeng"?

34:36.600 --> 34:38.310
I didn't see this in the novel

34:38.900 --> 34:40.400
Didn't you show me the entire novel?

34:40.560 --> 34:41.980
I'm helping you kill someone

34:42.190 --> 34:43.770
And still you hide things from me?

34:44.400 --> 34:46.440
What difference does it make?

34:47.150 --> 34:48.060
Fine

34:48.270 --> 34:49.560
I'll ask Lu Kongwen myself

34:49.770 --> 34:50.650
Who is calling me?

34:57.730 --> 34:58.980
My fan

35:01.600 --> 35:04.650
I forgot to ask your name

35:05.230 --> 35:06.060
I'm Guan Ning

35:06.270 --> 35:07.150
Guan Ning

35:07.690 --> 35:08.400
What's up?

35:11.650 --> 35:14.270
You mentioned a "Beihanfeng"

35:14.940 --> 35:15.770
In your novel

35:15.770 --> 35:16.650
No it's Baihan Fang

35:16.940 --> 35:17.690
Who's that?

35:28.400 --> 35:29.190
Are you okay?

35:31.400 --> 35:33.020
You almost killed me

35:33.480 --> 35:34.190
Oh sorry

35:34.350 --> 35:35.480
I was just dozing off

35:35.770 --> 35:36.600
Are you okay?

35:38.850 --> 35:39.560
Sorry

35:39.770 --> 35:40.650
I just called the police

35:41.020 --> 35:42.020
They'll be here any minute

35:42.230 --> 35:43.100
Hang on

35:51.150 --> 35:51.940
Guan Ning?

35:52.900 --> 35:53.980
Guan Ning

36:08.690 --> 36:10.520
I didn't dream about my daughter last night

36:11.440 --> 36:12.400
Which is weird

36:13.440 --> 36:15.100
But I went into that city

36:15.810 --> 36:16.940
It was so big

36:18.060 --> 36:19.230
There were armed men

36:19.850 --> 36:22.060
Something crimson wrapped on my head

36:22.770 --> 36:23.980
I couldn't see anything

36:24.690 --> 36:25.980
I just kept running

36:26.520 --> 36:27.940
Someone was chasing me

36:29.150 --> 36:30.730
But I couldn't tell who

37:23.520 --> 37:24.900
This is the capital

37:25.940 --> 37:27.310
What a city

37:29.100 --> 37:31.270
Is this some kind of carnival?

37:33.850 --> 37:36.150
You'll find out soon enough

37:42.190 --> 37:43.560
Kid

37:44.400 --> 37:45.400
Are you alright?

37:45.400 --> 37:46.230
Grandpa

37:47.020 --> 37:48.400
I can see you're well prepared

37:48.730 --> 37:50.480
With all this equipment

37:55.770 --> 37:56.310
Sir!

37:56.850 --> 37:58.020
What lies ahead?

37:58.230 --> 37:59.690
Why is everyone scrambling to get there?

38:00.270 --> 38:02.150
To worship Lord Redmane

38:31.100 --> 38:33.770
Lord Redmane

38:34.310 --> 38:36.850
Lord Redmane

38:38.600 --> 38:39.770
Kneel down

38:39.770 --> 38:41.690
Bless all sentient beings

38:42.190 --> 38:44.690
Bless all sentient beings

38:45.150 --> 38:47.440
Where the dragon soars

38:47.730 --> 38:49.940
Where the dragon soars

38:50.480 --> 38:52.690
All enemies fall

38:52.980 --> 38:55.270
All enemies fall

38:55.770 --> 38:57.980
Lord Redmane

38:59.230 --> 39:00.400
Who's this guy?

39:01.020 --> 39:02.560
Redmane

39:03.770 --> 39:05.600
He's no mortal like you

39:06.020 --> 39:07.850
Where the dragon soars

39:08.100 --> 39:09.940
Where the dragon soars

39:10.230 --> 39:14.900
All enemies fall

39:18.900 --> 39:23.900
The dragon rises, Baihan falls

39:24.150 --> 39:25.350
Steal the paintings

39:25.480 --> 39:26.810
Snatch the silks

39:26.810 --> 39:28.980
The dragon rises, Baihan falls

39:29.100 --> 39:30.150
Steal the paintings

39:30.190 --> 39:31.060
This is no festival

39:31.850 --> 39:32.980
Of course not!

39:33.310 --> 39:35.480
This City of Clouds had 18 districts

39:35.480 --> 39:38.810
Now only the dragon district and Baihan remain

39:39.060 --> 39:39.730
How come?

39:39.730 --> 39:43.150
Redmane ordered everyone to fight each other

39:43.560 --> 39:44.900
Until they were no more, haha!

39:53.350 --> 39:54.850
It really is a war

39:55.150 --> 39:56.730
Why does everyone look so happy?

39:57.020 --> 39:59.520
This is a world of chaos and madness

39:59.520 --> 40:01.230
And it's all because of Redmane

40:01.770 --> 40:02.650
But you...

40:03.270 --> 40:05.060
Do you really think you can kill him?

40:05.400 --> 40:06.520
Snatch the silks

40:06.520 --> 40:08.560
The dragon rises, Baihan falls

40:08.730 --> 40:10.730
Steal the paintings, snatch the silks

40:28.980 --> 40:31.270
Archers forward

40:34.940 --> 40:36.310
Archers forward

40:55.440 --> 40:58.520
Release!

41:17.650 --> 41:20.270
Shuan Zi !

41:23.690 --> 41:25.230
Release!

41:28.850 --> 41:30.100
Kill them!

41:30.770 --> 41:32.270
Kill them!

41:33.440 --> 41:34.560
Kill them all !

42:06.400 --> 42:09.650
Dragons!

42:19.600 --> 42:22.350
Release!

42:56.270 --> 42:57.350
Tar

42:57.350 --> 42:58.400
It's hot tar!

43:08.850 --> 43:12.850
Burn!

43:15.560 --> 43:19.150
Burn them to death

43:26.770 --> 43:28.600
Lord Redmane

43:28.600 --> 43:30.690
Bless all sentient beings

43:30.690 --> 43:32.900
Where the dragon soars

43:32.900 --> 43:34.900
all enemies fall

44:16.060 --> 44:17.310
No!

44:18.270 --> 44:19.270
Want to run away?

44:19.980 --> 44:20.520
No you don't!

44:20.520 --> 44:21.440
Let go of me

44:29.440 --> 44:31.350
Amid the coming calamity

44:32.270 --> 44:33.940
There will be parched lips and dry throats

44:34.850 --> 44:36.690
But in the joy of today

44:37.310 --> 44:38.940
Everything is pleasant

44:43.480 --> 44:45.480
As summer fades to winter

44:47.060 --> 44:49.980
So Baihan's image will fade

44:59.310 --> 45:00.600
This can't be real

45:02.150 --> 45:03.190
You're frightened

45:03.770 --> 45:05.690
What's wrong with this city?

45:42.810 --> 45:45.650
By order of Lord Redmane

45:45.770 --> 45:48.940
Your heads are to be removed

45:57.400 --> 45:58.350
Move

45:58.350 --> 45:59.310
It's getting dark

45:59.310 --> 46:00.850
Don't miss the curfew

46:35.810 --> 46:37.060
The car that hit me yesterday

46:37.600 --> 46:38.980
You set that up, didn't you?

46:39.150 --> 46:40.730
Your behavior yesterday was terrible

46:41.520 --> 46:43.770
I guess you no longer want to find your daughter

46:45.520 --> 46:47.900
And she probably doesn't want to see you either

46:48.100 --> 46:49.310
Bullshit !

46:50.310 --> 46:52.020
You know nothing about losing a child

47:31.480 --> 47:32.810
Pull him out

47:39.060 --> 47:40.060
Tu Ling

47:41.560 --> 47:42.350
Tu Ling!

47:44.690 --> 47:46.400
Daddy, come and find me!

47:46.690 --> 47:48.560
You can do it if you try

47:48.810 --> 47:51.400
If not the monster will get me

47:51.900 --> 47:53.600
Daddy will beat the monster

47:54.230 --> 47:55.230
And rescue you

48:03.810 --> 48:04.940
I said pull him out!

48:10.440 --> 48:11.810
You're a tough one

48:15.150 --> 48:16.600
I won't die

48:16.770 --> 48:18.520
I will bring Tangerine home

48:19.020 --> 48:20.560
She's waiting for me

48:28.440 --> 48:29.190
Hello sir

48:29.650 --> 48:31.150
This is reception

48:31.230 --> 48:33.310
There's a Mr. Lu here looking for you

48:36.440 --> 48:37.810
I'll be right down

48:41.980 --> 48:43.230
You dropped this

48:45.600 --> 48:46.900
A room card was inside

48:46.900 --> 48:48.060
That's how I found you

48:57.440 --> 48:58.650
Can you show me around?

48:59.230 --> 49:00.690
You know, somewhere not so crowded

49:13.100 --> 49:13.980
Have you read it?

49:18.520 --> 49:18.940
Read what?

49:18.940 --> 49:20.060
Godslayer

49:20.520 --> 49:22.520
I updated it last night

49:25.650 --> 49:26.690
It's not loading

49:26.900 --> 49:28.730
Your phone's a piece of junk

49:29.980 --> 49:31.560
My words were flowing last night

49:31.730 --> 49:33.060
All thanks to your little notebook

49:33.190 --> 49:34.150
It really inspired me

49:34.520 --> 49:35.230
So thanks

49:35.350 --> 49:36.100
You're welcome

49:37.690 --> 49:38.600
My little notebook

49:39.230 --> 49:39.730
Wait

49:40.650 --> 49:41.810
Why were you reading my notebook?

49:43.190 --> 49:45.190
I know, I should've asked

49:45.440 --> 49:47.600
But I've been stuck in this rut so long

49:47.600 --> 49:49.060
And it was driving me crazy

49:50.600 --> 49:52.020
Those ideas in your notebook

49:52.520 --> 49:53.900
How did you come up with them?

49:54.060 --> 49:55.270
None of your business

49:58.150 --> 49:59.440
I dreamt them, that's all

50:00.980 --> 50:02.440
Sorry

50:02.850 --> 50:04.770
I didn't mean to upset you

50:06.020 --> 50:07.520
You know

50:07.770 --> 50:08.600
In the past

50:09.230 --> 50:10.650
I wasn't such a nerd

50:10.980 --> 50:12.270
I was really outgoing

50:12.400 --> 50:13.730
Even had a girlfriend

50:15.730 --> 50:16.560
But this one time

50:19.900 --> 50:21.520
I read a novel

50:22.020 --> 50:23.230
From the library

50:25.520 --> 50:26.810
It was called "Seesaw"

50:28.560 --> 50:29.980
And it really touched me

50:31.650 --> 50:33.480
That's how I fell in love with novels

50:34.940 --> 50:36.350
Once I started writing

50:36.850 --> 50:38.150
Nothing else mattered

50:39.310 --> 50:41.230
Nothing

50:41.520 --> 50:43.060
At all

50:44.310 --> 50:45.230
Enough bricks

50:45.600 --> 50:46.150
Let's go

50:49.480 --> 50:51.690
Writing and writing...

50:52.310 --> 50:54.060
And by the time I realized it

50:55.770 --> 50:57.230
My girlfriend had gone

50:58.520 --> 51:00.100
My diploma had been cancelled

51:01.810 --> 51:03.310
I couldn't find a job

51:04.690 --> 51:05.900
But I felt fine

51:06.150 --> 51:07.900
I had my novel to write

51:08.980 --> 51:10.400
Though I felt bad for my mother

51:11.350 --> 51:12.690
Now it's been six years of writing

51:13.060 --> 51:14.520
Now it's been six years of writing

51:16.100 --> 51:16.900
Six years?

51:17.480 --> 51:18.900
Yeah, and it doesn't exactly pay well

51:19.190 --> 51:20.480
Yeah, and it doesn't exactly pay well

51:22.810 --> 51:24.230
I live off my mother

51:25.480 --> 51:27.600
Six years and you still haven't made it

51:27.770 --> 51:28.900
Just...

51:29.650 --> 51:30.730
Stop writing

51:32.060 --> 51:33.270
It's hopeless

51:35.060 --> 51:36.980
No matter what people say about me

51:39.650 --> 51:41.190
I always believe

51:42.440 --> 51:43.810
I can do it

51:45.690 --> 51:47.600
As long as I keep writing

51:48.600 --> 51:49.850
My existence...

51:50.400 --> 51:51.900
Has meaning

52:00.520 --> 52:01.730
Did you hear that?

52:06.020 --> 52:06.980
No?

52:24.900 --> 52:26.650
On a deserted street

52:26.900 --> 52:29.770
Kongwen recklessly chased the crimson cavalrymen

52:30.020 --> 52:32.940
That talking armour hasn't spoken in a while

52:33.310 --> 52:36.150
Maybe he's fallen asleep

52:42.770 --> 52:44.650
Come on, let's go home

52:45.310 --> 52:46.270
You're so heavy

52:51.600 --> 52:52.400
Go away

53:01.190 --> 53:01.900
Go away

53:11.520 --> 53:12.650
You've lost him

53:14.900 --> 53:15.770
He's already cold

53:21.520 --> 53:22.900
Is this your brother?

53:23.190 --> 53:24.350
You could say that

53:29.560 --> 53:30.650
Prized from the dead people's mouths

53:31.100 --> 53:32.350
They can be traded for food

53:37.150 --> 53:38.400
Those cavalrymen

53:39.020 --> 53:39.900
Who were they?

53:40.560 --> 53:42.100
When they blew their horns

53:42.400 --> 53:43.770
Why did everyone scatter?

53:45.190 --> 53:46.850
You're not local?

53:49.480 --> 53:50.190
No wonder

53:50.900 --> 53:53.150
Those are Redmane's personal troops

53:53.350 --> 53:55.270
When there's no fighting a curfew is imposed

53:55.440 --> 53:58.150
They come out and blow their horns before sunset

53:58.400 --> 53:59.230
After dark

54:00.150 --> 54:01.400
No one is allowed out

54:02.770 --> 54:04.230
What happens if they do?

54:05.520 --> 54:06.440
They'll die

54:11.690 --> 54:12.600
If not for you

54:13.230 --> 54:14.940
I'd have been dead ten times over

54:55.480 --> 54:57.150
This crimson stuff

54:58.100 --> 54:59.730
I can't see anything

55:00.520 --> 55:02.020
Little girl

55:16.100 --> 55:16.770
What's up?

55:17.900 --> 55:18.650
Not good

55:18.810 --> 55:19.650
The sun

55:20.900 --> 55:21.650
The sun?

55:22.730 --> 55:24.190
I forgot the time

55:45.560 --> 55:46.310
Don't worry

55:47.520 --> 55:48.350
Run quickly

56:10.940 --> 56:12.100
This way, quickly

56:14.900 --> 56:15.650
This way,

56:24.350 --> 56:25.190
Over here

56:39.350 --> 56:40.270
Dead end!

56:45.600 --> 56:47.060
Up to the roof!

56:55.060 --> 56:55.770
Get up

57:03.560 --> 57:04.440
Come on

57:12.560 --> 57:13.730
You can't run fast carrying me

57:55.650 --> 57:56.060
Here

57:57.060 --> 57:57.730
Over here

57:58.190 --> 57:59.270
Come on, hurry up

59:27.650 --> 59:28.810
Stop!

59:43.600 --> 59:44.900
Run

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.400
Run

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:53.270
Do you hear it?

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.940
It's coming again

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.230
Guan Ning

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.270
Guan Ning

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:17.230
Guan Ning

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.310
Guan Ning

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:25.900
Guan Ning, help!

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.650
Little Tangerine

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.150
Oh little Tangerine

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.730
Soon you'll grow big

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:23.060
Boing boing boing

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.810
Little Tangerine

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:26.770
Oh little Tangerine

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.400
Soon you'll grow tall

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:36.810
Boing boing boing

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.900
Little Tangerine

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.060
Oh little Tangerine

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:45.060
To grow tall you must eat your fill

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.150
Little Tangerine

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:50.020
Oh little Tangerine

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.770
Soon you'll grow tall

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.060
Little Tangerine

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.310
Oh little Tangerine

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:03.650
To grow tall you must eat your fill

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:07.560
Teehee it's me, lovely little Tangerine

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:11.730
Daddy says I'm the best little lady on earth

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:15.900
But my daddy's a fool

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:18.900
Please forgive him, mummy

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:26.770
This song

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.600
Who taught it to you?

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.480
Where did you hear it?

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.730
Tell me, tell me!

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.560
Where did you learn this song?

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.730
Tell me where you learnt this song!

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:37.810
Speak!

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:38.730
Yu Changhai!

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:47.020
Get him!

01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:48.600
Get him!

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:50.100
Bastard!

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.520
Stop beating me!

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.560
Where is my daughter?

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.440
Where is my daughter?

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:22.520
Tangerine?

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:24.850
Little Tangerine?

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.650
Yes

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.270
Tangerine

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.940
Little Tangerine

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:33.980
Where is she?

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.900
Man...

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.690
Just listen to me

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.980
I didn't do it on purpose

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:41.440
But I put your kid...

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:43.940
In a sack...

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:46.020
And locked her in the trunk

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.600
I was scared she'd make a noise

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:51.480
So I drugged her

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:53.440
That was my first time

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.270
I was an amateur

01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:59.600
I didn't know the right dose

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.270
So I gave her a bit too much

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.650
When I checked her later

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.770
She...

01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:11.310
She didn't wake up

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:16.190
This is rain, don't you know?

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.100
It's called " rain"

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:21.100
Raining

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.060
You haven't played in the rain before

01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:25.690
Want to try?

01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:26.520
Let's go

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.770
I really didn't mean to

01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:31.520
I have money

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:32.730
Really

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:33.900
I can pay you

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.650
Man, I'll pay you

01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:19.850
Go back to the hotel

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:21.689
I'm going to kill him

01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:23.350
Didn't you hear what I said?

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:24.270
Move!

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.229
He's awake

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:44.850
Take care of Guan Ning

01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:46.729
We need him

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:55.020
Yu Changhai said

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.729
My daughter is dead

01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:59.189
He must be mistaken

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:02.350
Or is lying

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.560
You have to be certain

01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:05.399
You have to reassure him

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.729
Those five girls

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:10.810
Was any one of them actually my daughter?

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.270
There's no hope

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:28.600
There never was

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.149
You're in a fragile emotional state

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:37.020
I'll get someone else to do this

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.310
You should stand down

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:41.060
Tu Ling!

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:42.100
What did you say?

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:43.729
We can't let him go

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.979
We need him to kill Lu Kongwen

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:50.020
Where's Yu Changhai?

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:51.520
We have him

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.060
I'll find a way to turn him in to the police

01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:56.350
He'll get the punishment he deserves

01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:58.190
Punishment

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:03.270
Hand him over to me, not the police

01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:04.900
One life for another

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.810
That's what we agreed

01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:08.600
There's no going back

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.600
I'll trade Lu Kongwen's life

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.850
For Yu Changhai's

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:16.810
Tomorrow is the last day

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.560
Wait for my call

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:46.310
Just now...

01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:48.350
You really wanted to let him go

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:50.520
Those five girls...

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:54.270
Were all fake, weren't they?

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.350
Of course

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.400
Guan Ning spent six years trying to find his daughter

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.230
How do you think I could find her?

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.350
You used his dead daughter

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:02.770
You're feeling sorry for him

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:06.020
Guan Ning is just like your parents

01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:08.190
Threw his kid away like a piece of garbage

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.400
Discarded

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:10.350
Or misplaced

01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:12.310
You're a piece of discarded trash, too

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.730
And yet you feel sorry for him

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.690
Why must it be Guan Ning who kills Kongwen?

01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:20.850
It just has to be him

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.480
It's essential

01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:41.400
Go, go

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:42.810
Long ago

01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:45.980
The emperor had two favorite generals

01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:47.770
One was called Redmane

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.100
The other Jiutian

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:51.150
They were sworn brothers

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:53.900
But for a long time, the emperor didn't attend court

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.770
And Redmane ruled on important matters

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.650
People said the emperor was dead

01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:02.900
Redmane had them rounded up and beheaded

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.270
After Jiutian heard

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.520
He returned with his soldiers to see the emperor

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.060
Redmane said to Jiutian

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.190
Go home my good brother

01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:13.190
Go home my good brother

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.980
Obey me and I'll make you prime minister

01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:17.940
Jiutian refused

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:19.560
And started a fight with Redmane

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:21.230
What happened then?

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.810
Jiutian was killed

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.730
And declared a traitor

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.150
His whole clan was wiped out

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:30.190
Redmane resented the citizens who helped Jiutian

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:33.690
So he turned the 18 districts against each other

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.600
Time passed

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.100
And it turned into a war

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:38.810
Whenever fighting starts

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.650
Redmane lets off fireworks

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:43.150
I guess he likes war

01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:49.100
Dad

01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:50.400
Mum

01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:52.270
I'm home

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:00.980
A few years ago

01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:03.940
My parents went out for food

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.690
And must have missed the curfew

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.690
They never came back

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.600
My dad painted this

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:16.060
My mum in her childhood

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.440
It's beautiful!

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.850
Such art was the most precious thing in Baihan

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.770
All of the paintings in the district were looted

01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:26.190
It will be light soon

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.480
They'll come to take my mum's paintings

01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:30.400
And kill me as well!

01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:31.520
Run away with me

01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:33.310
There's nowhere to run

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.400
The world belongs to Redmane

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.900
Kill them all!

01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:42.440
Wipe them out!

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.150
The door's locked

01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:45.350
Over the hedge!

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.150
Open the gate!

01:13:58.190 --> 01:13:59.270
This way

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.400
Search this place

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.770
Look for paintings

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.770
Nothing's left

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:06.900
Not a piece

01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:12.770
Damn it! Someone's been here

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:13.980
There's nothing left

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:16.440
Let's kill these two brats and be on our way

01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:22.810
I won't let you tie my head to a tree

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.230
Really?

01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:49.850
So this is how you're going to die?

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:51.310
How boring

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:04.310
Hello

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:05.310
It's Guan Ning

01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:06.480
Where are you?

01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:09.940
You were right yesterday

01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:12.480
For so many years...

01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:16.060
I have kept writing

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.940
Without any success

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.560
And at the expense of my mother

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.810
I've been too reckless

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.850
Yesterday,some madman was throwing rocks at me

01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:30.060
I thought I was going to die

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.770
I could hear my heart

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.810
Racing in my chest

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.480
It was so clear

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.060
For a moment

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:41.560
I thought...

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.650
Dying would be easier

01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:47.060
I'd be at ease

01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:49.310
So at ease

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.440
I understand

01:15:57.690 --> 01:15:59.770
All our lives we live on hope

01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:02.730
But that hope...

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.230
Is never forthcoming

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.900
Just think of my father

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.230
One day he was fine

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.520
And gone the next

01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:17.310
If somebody pushed me off right now

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:21.310
It would solve everything

01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:25.810
I would sincerely thank that person

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.270
Unfortunately...

01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:35.810
I still haven't finished...

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.520
Writing your character

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:47.400
What do you mean, "my character"?

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.650
I told you

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:52.440
In your notebook

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.940
The warrior

01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:57.100
With something crimson on his head

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.100
I can't see anything

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:01.060
That was so cool

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:03.350
I put you in the novel

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:04.980
Yesterday

01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:08.310
I hurriedly wrote it in your notebook

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.980
Well, technically speaking

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.520
It wasn't you I wrote

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.900
More like...

01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:17.810
A crimson warrior

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.100
That grew out of you

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:38.600
Run

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.060
The wound on the warrior's head

01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:50.900
It's exactly the same as yours

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.900
Identical

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.650
From what you wrote

01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:08.310
The warrior doesn't seem to be chasing Kongwen

01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:10.560
But chasing the girl

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.440
I think...

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.690
He was after the girl's flute

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:14.980
A flute?

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.730
I don't know

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.440
But the warrior...

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.730
He was enchanted by Tangerine's flute playing

01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:30.690
Tangerine?

01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:32.900
Who's that?

01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:36.150
The girl in the story

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.270
That ten-year-old girl

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.810
The one from Baihan Fang

01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:42.690
She lost her parents

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:53.520
Every time this Redmane gets sick or hurt

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.440
My boss faints like today

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.190
That's the third time now

01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:59.060
I guess the one in Baihan...

01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:00.600
Isn't interesting enough

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.980
So I wrote you into the novel

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.400
And because of your dream

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.520
My boss has determined it's you

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.770
He thinks this is fate

01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:07.190
Bring Tangerine home

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.350
She's waiting for me

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.150
Daddy, come and find me!

01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:13.100
You can if you try

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:16.400
If not the monster will get me

01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:18.520
Daddy, come and find me!

01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:20.900
You can if you try

01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:24.020
If not the monster will get me

01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:32.350
Your novel

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.440
Can it change reality?

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.350
That's a strange question

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:39.770
A novel changing reality

01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:41.730
I don't know...

01:19:42.850 --> 01:19:43.900
But I do believe

01:19:44.230 --> 01:19:46.020
That the novel's world and people

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.310
Exist

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:49.730
Somewhere...

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.650
They are just like us

01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:53.400
Living

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.190
For real

01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:00.350
Although they evaded the crimson warrior

01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:04.900
Kongwen and Tangerine were surrounded by a mob

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.230
How do they escape?

01:20:12.230 --> 01:20:13.560
Well you're the one writing it

01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:16.060
Then you can decide what happens next

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:20.060
Tell me

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.020
That talking armour

01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:23.440
Who's side is it on?

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.600
The armour feeds on Kongwen's blood

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:29.190
So those two have this...

01:20:30.230 --> 01:20:31.650
Weird symbiosis

01:20:31.810 --> 01:20:32.520
Well that's clear

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.560
I get it!

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.100
They're going to kill Tangerine

01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:25.560
And take her parents' paintings

01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:29.060
Your heart is racing, young man

01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:31.600
I'll kill anyone who lays a hand on this girl

01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:34.350
Ah yes, the taste of blood

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.310
Kill them!

01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:42.310
Hang their heads on a tree

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.270
Monsters

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:03.060
Cockroaches

01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:05.900
Come

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.440
Let me crush you

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.850
Run Tangerine!

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.400
My meatball

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.230
Stop!

01:24:06.690 --> 01:24:08.020
Enough!

01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:14.650
Hurry!

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:15.810
Run!

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.350
It's you

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:56.850
No

01:24:57.810 --> 01:24:58.520
No

01:24:58.730 --> 01:24:59.190
No

01:25:02.150 --> 01:25:02.900
No

01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:05.060
Impossible

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:07.270
How could it...

01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:08.600
What's this for?

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:15.850
Get up

01:25:18.850 --> 01:25:19.770
Are you okay?

01:25:26.850 --> 01:25:27.810
Done yet?

01:25:28.270 --> 01:25:29.270
I've had enough

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.520
What are you sighing for? I really...

01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:47.230
What the...

01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:50.440
Hey

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:51.520
Ah!

01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:53.900
No! Please!

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.600
I didn't think...

01:25:57.230 --> 01:25:58.690
That you would be so...

01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:01.150
Mean

01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:06.730
What else do you want?

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:07.600
Kneel

01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:09.310
Never!

01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:17.850
For four hundred years

01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:20.770
I never expected that

01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:21.560
A mortal

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:23.770
Controlling me

01:26:28.150 --> 01:26:30.310
You drank too much of my blood

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.810
So what? Your blood is tasty!

01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:33.520
I've held back for four hundred years...

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.730
Return

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.310
Bastard

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:43.020
Bastard

01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.650
You bastard!

01:26:58.150 --> 01:26:59.020
Tu Ling

01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:00.480
I know you're listening in

01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:01.810
I quit

01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:04.520
I won't let Lu Kongwen die

01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.060
Once he finishes the novel

01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:08.060
I'll turn myself in to the police

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:09.350
Tangerine

01:27:09.690 --> 01:27:10.850
Wherever you are

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.690
Even if you can't come back

01:27:12.690 --> 01:27:14.100
Even if you're only in the story

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.520
I will make you live on

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:18.560
Who on earth are you?

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.900
I've come to kill Redmane

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:25.350
I know the way

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:26.730
To the mountain palace

01:27:27.730 --> 01:27:28.770
I'll take you there

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:56.730
You're so full of ideas

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.400
Perhaps you could do me a favor

01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:00.480
And help me to finish the novel

01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:02.350
You'll be the first to read it

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:06.100
This guy

01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:08.940
My dad

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:10.810
I mean the man next to him

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.020
That's a friend of my dad's

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:12.850
It's...

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.690
Yes

01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:16.770
The famous Li Mu

01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:18.310
They went to medical school together

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:19.850
My dad

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.810
Founded a company with him

01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:24.520
Then one day they were in an accident

01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:26.480
And my dad died

01:28:36.810 --> 01:28:37.850
Take a break

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:39.100
Let's find somewhere quiet

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.600
You knew Lu Kongwen all along

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.600
He's your business partner's son

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.690
Why did you hide that from me?

01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.810
How did his father die?

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:50.810
What else are you keeping from me?

01:28:51.190 --> 01:28:52.480
I didn't tell you

01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:54.230
For your own good

01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:55.560
Do you really believe his novel can kill you?

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:56.940
Or you just want kill them all?

01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:58.690
I believe in karma

01:28:59.310 --> 01:29:01.020
After Lu Kongwen and Guan Ning

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.770
I'm next, right?

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:06.690
So I'm quitting

01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:07.560
With immediate effect

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.150
Mr. Li

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.480
We checked a few days ago

01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:15.100
And all of your levels were good

01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:18.150
Today there are a few abnormalities

01:29:18.730 --> 01:29:20.100
Yet still within the safe range

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.810
If you're still concerned about it

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.190
Then please come back without delay

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.150
And we'll do another thorough check

01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.810
Ma'am

01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:35.350
Is this your car?

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:37.980
Please move it out of the unloading zone

01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:00.560
Cool, huh?

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:02.020
There's a lithium battery inside

01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:03.270
With a very powerful current

01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:04.230
Want to try?

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.480
I actually thought you were generating power yourself

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.190
You've seen too many sci-fi movies

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.770
I'm just harder to electrocute than most people

01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:14.150
As a kid I was always touching power sockets

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.350
To charge myself

01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:17.310
And then shock the girls at school

01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:18.480
It was so much fun

01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:30.940
Sorry

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:32.400
I'm bothering you again

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:34.400
It's okay

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:36.810
You can use this place whenever you want

01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:38.060
Keep the key

01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:38.940
Okay

01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:56.850
For some reason

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:00.190
The path was not patrolled by Redmane's guards

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:01.850
When it should have been

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:07.560
So Tangerine and Kongwen made it to the palace easily

01:31:09.690 --> 01:31:10.560
Don't risk your life

01:31:10.690 --> 01:31:11.600
Go home

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:13.100
I've heard that...

01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:15.190
Many who disappear end up in the palace

01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:17.520
As disciples of Redmane

01:31:17.850 --> 01:31:19.560
My parents might be there

01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:21.230
I must go and find them

01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:47.060
Kongwen

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:49.100
Come back

01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:11.560
Kongwen

01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:41.940
I know why Redmane has imposed a curfew

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.690
His soldiers can't move at night

01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:46.650
Redmane doesn't want people to find out

01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:47.600
Let's go

01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:03.400
I'm going down for a walk

01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:05.060
I'll be back later

01:33:43.190 --> 01:33:44.150
Here

01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.940
Take this!

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.400
Where is he?

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.560
Where is he?

01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:45.940
Let's split up and search

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:47.850
Let's split up and search

01:34:53.770 --> 01:34:55.350
Still making progress?

01:34:55.730 --> 01:34:57.060
You must yearn for death

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.520
Help me get vengeance

01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:00.020
When Redmane is dead

01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:01.310
I'll let you go

01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:02.520
Don't take me for a fool

01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:05.440
I'm the one who killed your sister

01:35:05.650 --> 01:35:07.150
My real enemy is Redmane

01:35:07.770 --> 01:35:09.020
I already killed you once

01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:10.980
I have no hatred for you

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.480
All along...

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.560
I've treated you as my buddy

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.100
Come on, one more!

01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.900
Come on

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:51.560
Come on

01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:56.020
Have a look

01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.940
Running out?

01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:58.350
Look carefully

01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:04.270
I'll switch myself to the highest current

01:36:04.770 --> 01:36:05.270
Really

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.190
You won't feel a thing

01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:07.850
Trust me

01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:09.270
It feels good

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.100
Come on, try it

01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:12.600
Come on

01:36:27.730 --> 01:36:28.770
Rubber glove

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:30.150
Wooden floor

01:36:31.150 --> 01:36:31.980
Insulation

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:35.400
How could you be so evil?

01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:47.480
The drumming is getting much louder

01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:51.400
But there's no sight of the drummer

01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:54.480
Hey

01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.770
What?

01:36:56.150 --> 01:36:57.650
Armour, what does Redmane look like?

01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:59.850
I've never seen him, no one has

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.060
You should go back

01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:07.060
Redmane

01:37:07.230 --> 01:37:07.770
Show yourself!

01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:09.060
You're scaring me

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:10.190
My name is Kongwen!

01:37:11.650 --> 01:37:12.900
I've come to kill you!

01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:14.440
Nobody's home

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.810
Take my advice and leave

01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:23.230
That's not drumming

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:30.850
Not from drums

01:37:31.230 --> 01:37:32.190
It's his heartbeat

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.150
Redmane

01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:32.310
You damn fool

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:44.060
Alright, that's enough

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.520
Just give up

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:47.650
You should go to the hospital

01:41:18.690 --> 01:41:21.020
I knew this face

01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:29.480
Unmistakeably

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:31.810
Of the same breed

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.980
What are you talking about?

01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:37.730
You really don't know?

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.230
The year you were born

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.150
I went to see you

01:41:42.650 --> 01:41:44.350
Your name is Kongwen

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.600
You're the son of my sworn brother

01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:48.980
Jiutian

01:41:51.650 --> 01:41:52.520
From the start...

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:56.310
I should never have let you and your sister live

01:41:58.100 --> 01:41:59.980
That is true karma!

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:03.480
But it's fine

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:06.190
I've been alone

01:42:07.230 --> 01:42:09.270
For way too long now

01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:11.400
This Jiutian you speak of

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.350
My father...

01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:18.900
Was killed by you, too?

01:42:25.650 --> 01:42:26.730
I'll take you

01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:29.150
To see your father

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.480
Don't try to run away

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.940
You know

01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:40.520
You can't escape

01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:57.940
Did you see that?

01:42:58.190 --> 01:42:59.600
Between his eyebrows

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.190
There was a sword stuck in there

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:07.020
It seems Redmane isn't so invincible

01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:11.020
Let's do it

01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:12.650
I'll cover you

01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:15.150
Your father is here

01:43:16.150 --> 01:43:17.480
Killed beneath this tree

01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:19.980
And buried here too

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.440
Before I became a god

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:42.310
He was my best friend

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:44.650
We fought battles together

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.520
Drank together

01:43:47.650 --> 01:43:48.810
Chatted

01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:53.900
I miss him dearly

01:43:55.650 --> 01:43:56.770
You killed him!

01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:58.980
Right

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:02.100
Sadly mortals cannot escape death

01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:06.150
It would bring me such joy

01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:11.190
To kill him a few more times

01:44:17.730 --> 01:44:18.400
Tangerine

01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:19.730
Stay back

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:25.230
How do we fight him?

01:44:25.650 --> 01:44:26.650
Chop off his feet

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:34.480
Go get him

01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:16.690
Watch out!

01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:40.270
A mere mortal

01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:43.060
Daring to slay a god

01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:45.190
You don't deserve to be a person

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.980
You're a demon!

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.100
Go get him!

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:56.480
When I held your father in my hands

01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:59.190
He struggled for quite a while

01:47:00.190 --> 01:47:01.940
Now I'm wondering

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.650
How long could you last?

01:47:09.810 --> 01:47:10.900
Take this!

01:47:19.730 --> 01:47:22.770
Let go of me

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.810
Meatball!

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:01.150
I shall kill you, slowly...

01:48:19.230 --> 01:48:20.190
Girl

01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:22.440
What tune is that?

01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:24.850
It's one my father taught me

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.310
He said

01:48:26.850 --> 01:48:28.270
Whenever I play this tune

01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:30.770
He will come to rescue me

01:48:34.350 --> 01:48:36.150
Your father lied to you

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:42.230
Enough!

01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.850
It's getting on my nerves

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:52.350
Tangerine!

01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:58.480
My fault, my fault

01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:05.480
The novel is behind schedule

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:08.440
I have to finish it

01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:16.310
Stay here overnight for observation

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.440
Sorry

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:30.310
I've come late

01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:32.150
It seems

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:33.810
this Lu Kongwen...

01:50:35.150 --> 01:50:36.400
Won't make it

01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:40.270
My original plan...

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:41.310
Was for the police...

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:42.980
To think you'd killed yourself

01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:44.690
The police would also have discovered...

01:50:45.230 --> 01:50:46.810
Tangerine's name in the novel

01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:49.060
And that she's so similar to my daughter

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:49.940
Also...

01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:51.520
Remember the dream diary you sent us?

01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:53.230
Remember the dream diary you sent us?

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:54.400
I um...

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.190
forged your handwriting...

01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:57.770
And livend up your dreams

01:50:57.980 --> 01:50:59.310
This proves my suspicions

01:50:59.310 --> 01:51:01.190
Kongwen is linked to Tangerine's disappearance

01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:03.270
That's why I wanted to kill him

01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:06.350
You hacked my phone

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.100
So I wouldn't read the parts about her

01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:11.350
What a coincidence!

01:51:11.690 --> 01:51:14.230
That your daughter is also called Tangerine

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:16.270
That's why you chose me as the fall guy

01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:17.850
Once I died...

01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:19.190
This case would be closed...

01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:21.270
And no one would suspect you

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:24.100
You'd both better leave now

01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:25.650
You'll get your compensation

01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:26.980
Five million each

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.350
You think you can sweep this under the rug

01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:32.310
But the death of Kongwen's father

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:33.940
Is enough to bring you down

01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.600
Don't like the taste of losing?

01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:44.310
Call the police

01:51:45.690 --> 01:51:47.060
We're accomplices

01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:49.560
Want to go down together?

01:51:50.850 --> 01:51:52.400
Just move on with your life

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:55.100
Alright

01:51:55.650 --> 01:51:56.600
I'll need the computer

01:51:58.560 --> 01:51:59.350
Guan Ning

01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:00.150
Be quiet

01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:02.350
I need to finish the novel

01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:06.310
Is this a joke?

01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:07.270
You don't know how to write

01:52:07.650 --> 01:52:08.560
All you can do is throw rocks

01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:10.150
I realize now

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.190
I wasn't sent to kill Lu Kongwen

01:52:14.690 --> 01:52:16.560
I am here to help him finish the story

01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:18.520
I had those dreams

01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:20.940
Because Tangerine was calling me

01:52:21.730 --> 01:52:23.190
From the other world

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.310
He's really lost it

01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:26.270
You've really lost it

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:27.940
You think you can write her back to life?

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:29.600
You don't have that power

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.310
Yes I do

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:35.730
Because I believe

01:52:38.690 --> 01:52:39.940
You're insane

01:52:41.770 --> 01:52:42.560
Give it to me

01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:45.980
Tu Ling

01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:49.350
I'm really curious...

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:52.400
To see if this novel can write you to death

01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:56.520
I'm Tangerine, loved by all who set eyes on me

01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:03.310
Mummy says I'm the best little lady on earth

01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:11.150
To grow tall I must eat my fill

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:14.020
I believe...

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:18.100
I can write this

01:53:28.190 --> 01:53:29.940
Give Tangerine back to me!

01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:51.310
Such a stubborn girl

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:52.520
Tangerine

01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:56.650
It's useless

01:53:57.150 --> 01:53:59.520
No one is coming to save you

01:54:04.810 --> 01:54:07.600
How vain the hopes of mortals!

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.150
Tangerine!

01:54:28.770 --> 01:54:30.150
Daddy's here!

01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:43.980
Say hello to my big pal, you ape!

01:54:46.810 --> 01:54:48.980
Dad, I'm here

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:50.940
Quick! Save me!

01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:13.900
Take this! I'll kick your ass!

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:41.650
Having fun?

01:55:41.650 --> 01:55:44.310
Who's the boss now?

01:55:48.230 --> 01:55:49.100
Tangerine

01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.730
Your dad really came

01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.350
Reload

01:56:09.230 --> 01:56:12.400
In the name of the moon, I'll punish you!

01:56:26.690 --> 01:56:28.850
Human cannon!

01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:52.560
That blade on his forehead

01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:23.770
You're alive?

01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:30.690
Dad

01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:51.810
What the... I must help him

01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.520
Dad!

01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:01.900
Tangerine!

01:58:02.690 --> 01:58:04.060
Daddy's here!

01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:27.810
You can't pull it out!

01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:30.980
Return my father's blade

01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.100
Stop!

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:40.310
Return my father's blade

01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:43.480
I don't want to die

01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:48.400
There's so much more I have to do

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:50.020
I ...

01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:51.940
need more time

01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:55.400
I ...

01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:58.230
can surpass everyone

01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:00.060
And become ...

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:01.520
a true...

02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:03.190
God

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:04.770
God

02:00:04.770 --> 02:00:07.100
Beat the monster for me, daddy!

02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:11.400
As you wish!

02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:53.310
If my parents were like you

02:00:54.190 --> 02:00:55.690
I wouldn't have met Li Mu

02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:57.480
The doctors asked me to tell you

02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:58.650
Lu Kongwen is stable

02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:03.690
Li mu

02:01:03.690 --> 02:01:05.100
The cops are on their way

02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:11.150
Guan Ning!

02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:32.400
Oh my sweet Tangerine

02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:34.810
Little Tangerine

02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:38.100
Soon you'll grow big

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:40.230
Boing boing boing

02:01:40.810 --> 02:01:42.400
Oh my sweet Tangerine

02:01:43.190 --> 02:01:44.770
My sweet little Tangerine

02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:47.810
If you want to grow tall

02:01:50.650 --> 02:01:52.310
Then you must eat your fill

02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:56.900
I'm Tangerine, loved by all who set eyes on me

02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:59.020
Mummy said

02:01:59.650 --> 02:02:01.730
I'm the best little lady on earth

02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:03.940
My daddy

02:02:05.770 --> 02:02:06.940
Is a fool

02:02:07.730 --> 02:02:10.770
Forgive him, mummy

02:02:20.650 --> 02:02:21.850
Dad

02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:24.350
What took you so long?

02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:26.650
Daddy

02:02:39.650 --> 02:02:41.100
Don't cry

02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:58.520
Dad

02:02:58.520 --> 02:02:59.480
Let's go home

02:02:59.770 --> 02:03:00.600
Let's go home

02:05:27.150 --> 02:05:28.350
Is it dawn?
