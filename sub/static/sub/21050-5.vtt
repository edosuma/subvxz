♪♪

00:09.492 --> 00:12.860
Oh, man, that is
classic cinema.

00:12.927 --> 00:14.269
So good!

00:14.327 --> 00:15.706
Oh, and remember
when the surgeon

00:15.764 --> 00:17.237
tried to cut
the mole queen in half

00:17.320 --> 00:19.480
but then she multiplied
into a million mole babies

00:19.547 --> 00:20.630
and then they ate him?

00:25.650 --> 00:26.993
Aah!

00:27.235 --> 00:29.332
You said this was
an educational film.

00:29.390 --> 00:30.668
Suitable for all ages.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.002
Uh, it's a cautionary tale

00:32.060 --> 00:33.543
about the dangers
of mole monsters.

00:33.610 --> 00:34.900
And everyone
could use a lesson

00:34.967 --> 00:36.717
on chainsaw safety.

00:40.060 --> 00:41.349
Lame!

00:41.407 --> 00:43.428
Where was the drama, the heart,

00:43.518 --> 00:46.271
the needlessly expensive
car crash mayhem?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.833
Even if mole men
did exist,

00:47.900 --> 00:49.702
why attack someone
in the shower?

00:49.811 --> 00:51.012
With the water running
there wouldn't be

00:51.070 --> 00:53.294
enough traction to attack
anyone above the knee.

00:53.352 --> 00:54.547
Totally phony.

00:54.618 --> 00:56.294
What is with you guys?

00:56.454 --> 00:57.820
It says
right on the poster:

00:57.887 --> 01:01.045
Based on an Actual
True Novel.

01:01.256 --> 01:03.453
This is the only book
I trust.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.833
If it's not in the
Junior Woodchuck guidebook,

01:05.900 --> 01:06.980
then it's not a thing.

01:07.047 --> 01:08.400
What about
were-ducks?

01:08.467 --> 01:09.663
- Nope.
- Tri-clopses?

01:09.730 --> 01:11.183
- Not a thing.
- Well, what about

01:11.241 --> 01:13.440
the legendary
Terra-Firmians of Duckburg?

01:13.805 --> 01:14.953
Let's see.

01:15.011 --> 01:17.636
Pterodactyl, terror-dactyl,
terrible twos.

01:17.738 --> 01:18.738
Nope.
No Terra-Firmians.

01:18.797 --> 01:21.027
Must not exist.

01:21.136 --> 01:22.867
What? Terra-Firmians,

01:22.925 --> 01:24.238
the mythical
underground race

01:24.305 --> 01:25.955
that live below
our very city?

01:26.377 --> 01:27.778
No. That's ridiculous.

01:27.845 --> 01:29.198
No, you're ridiculous.

- Stop, Launchpad. No!

01:46.308 --> 01:48.671
It's just an ad.

someone where we're going

- Okay, don't wait up.
- Ah, much better.

03:05.020 --> 03:07.079
I apologize

03:14.345 --> 03:16.671
Anyone could be a mole monster.
Anyone.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.778
Could be him or her
or that baby.

03:18.957 --> 03:21.340
Even him.

03:21.957 --> 03:24.559
All right, let's go

Advertise your product or brand here

03:45.238 --> 03:47.448
Hmm.
Now what's behind here?

03:47.515 --> 03:49.591
The old 818 train line.

03:49.658 --> 03:51.158
Famous for
Terra-Firmian sightings.

03:51.225 --> 03:52.791
That's why
it's closed off.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.091
The signs say
"closed for renovations."

03:55.158 --> 03:56.738
That's what they
want you to think.

03:56.805 --> 03:57.853
Who is they?

03:57.939 --> 03:59.267
Exactly.

03:59.814 --> 04:00.842
What?

04:10.318 --> 04:13.238
Well, we can't not go in
at this point.

04:13.305 --> 04:15.541
Hello?!

04:19.132 --> 04:20.846
These old tunnels.

04:20.978 --> 04:23.738
You can hear train
vibrations from miles away.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.955
That was no
subway train.

04:33.818 --> 04:36.028
The Terra-Firmians
are an ancient race

04:36.095 --> 04:37.778
built of two warring tribes.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.939
The Terries
and the Firmies.

04:40.103 --> 04:42.869
They were once united
under a proud king.

04:43.032 --> 04:45.095
After the king's
untimely death,

04:45.173 --> 04:49.345
an epic battle began over
who would assume control.

04:55.142 --> 04:57.256
But one day the
rightful prince

04:57.314 --> 04:58.892
will reunite
the two tribes

04:58.950 --> 05:01.994
and put an end to
their bitter conflict.

05:02.895 --> 05:03.975
And what's that?

05:04.033 --> 05:05.725
Oh, just a drawing

05:05.783 --> 05:06.988
of a candy
I wish they made.

05:07.055 --> 05:08.908
- Webbi-dings.
- And that?

05:09.189 --> 05:11.147
Me as a superhero.
Look, can we just focus

05:11.205 --> 05:12.595
on all the exciting
stuff I just said?

05:12.728 --> 05:14.479
So these Terra thingies

05:14.642 --> 05:16.012
are responsible
for that tremor?

05:16.095 --> 05:17.835
According to the JWG,

05:17.906 --> 05:20.062
earthquakes are shifting
tectonic plates.

05:20.175 --> 05:21.607
Science fact.

05:21.763 --> 05:23.330
No reason for any of us
to go in there.

05:23.388 --> 05:24.398
The book knows
everything.

05:27.184 --> 05:28.818
Did the book know
I was gonna do that?

05:28.924 --> 05:30.249
Hmm.

05:39.070 --> 05:42.265
Oh, I can't wait to meet
a real Terra-Firmian!

05:42.359 --> 05:44.324
I'm totally gonna
sacrifice myself

05:44.382 --> 05:45.632
in the name of
the rebellion.

05:45.690 --> 05:47.906
Oh, and then I can
hunt down your attackers

05:47.965 --> 05:49.948
- and avenge your death.
- Aww!

05:50.015 --> 05:52.658
That's sweet.
There!

05:53.372 --> 05:54.895
Claw marks!

05:54.953 --> 05:56.358
Proof they were here.

05:56.425 --> 05:57.510
Even better!

05:57.568 --> 05:58.791
The tremors exposed

05:58.858 --> 06:00.068
three kinds of rock.

06:00.135 --> 06:02.448
Schist, marble,
and gneiss.

06:02.515 --> 06:05.132
Ooh, do I spy
some shale?

06:05.195 --> 06:07.113
How is that better
than subway monsters?

06:07.171 --> 06:08.291
'Cause my thing's real.

06:08.358 --> 06:10.358
How can you dismiss this
after all the stuff

06:10.425 --> 06:12.001
we've seen
with Mr. McDuck?

06:12.068 --> 06:14.068
Most of that is actually
logged in the guidebook.

06:14.135 --> 06:15.778
Even the headless
man-horse?

06:15.837 --> 06:18.593
It's a big book.
Anything new, I add myself.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.007
Now help me
with the shale rock.

06:20.070 --> 06:21.566
Need it
for my geology badge.

06:21.624 --> 06:23.163
Why don't you ask
your best friend,

06:23.249 --> 06:24.999
the guidebook,
to help you?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.867
Oh, wait, you can't.
It's a book.

06:27.124 --> 06:30.238
"How to properly handle
rock samples in the field."

06:30.343 --> 06:33.608
Hmm. Ahem.
Mm-hmm.

06:48.986 --> 06:50.028
What was that?

06:56.238 --> 06:58.567
Um, after you.

07:07.419 --> 07:09.198
Terra-Firmian!

07:12.528 --> 07:14.333
Sorry, couldn't resist.

07:19.948 --> 07:21.381
Just more subway junk.

07:21.481 --> 07:22.988
Now, if you're all done,

07:23.055 --> 07:25.106
I have some rock
samples to collect.

07:25.896 --> 07:27.411
Aah!

07:29.630 --> 07:31.067
Oh! Hey, watch it!

07:31.140 --> 07:32.387
Louie?

07:34.158 --> 07:35.270
Granny?

07:35.419 --> 07:37.801
Aah! Those are moles!

07:37.927 --> 07:40.137
Launchpad, it's
just the guys.

07:40.348 --> 07:42.223
Uh, you would say that.

07:42.551 --> 07:44.973
Have there always been
three of them?

07:45.265 --> 07:46.541
I can explain.

07:46.608 --> 07:48.318
You are all
in big trouble.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.512
I assume this was
your idea.

07:51.027 --> 07:52.961
Sure, blame
the mysterious rebel

07:53.028 --> 07:54.331
playing by her own rules.

07:54.398 --> 07:55.881
No back talk!
You made me come

07:55.948 --> 07:58.028
all the way down here,
drag two more children

07:58.095 --> 08:00.398
and one man-child
right into danger.

08:00.465 --> 08:02.065
Man-child? Where?

08:02.979 --> 08:04.622
Easy, LP. Easy.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.348
One monster at a time.

08:06.473 --> 08:08.961
Aren't you supposed to be
crazy adventure family?

08:09.028 --> 08:11.108
This is like an afternoon
field trip for you people.

08:11.183 --> 08:13.996
Well, there won't be anymore
afternoon field trips for you.

08:14.055 --> 08:15.421
I can assure you that.

08:15.488 --> 08:16.988
Granny, Lena didn't
mean to...

08:18.608 --> 08:20.041
Terra-Firmians!

08:20.108 --> 08:22.231
Naturally occurring
tectonic shifts!

08:35.246 --> 08:37.188
Splendid.
We're stuck.

08:37.511 --> 08:39.392
It looks like the only
safe way out of here

08:39.450 --> 08:40.619
is to get
this train moving.

08:40.677 --> 08:42.136
Launchpad, get to
the control room.

08:42.261 --> 08:44.801
No, Mrs. B.
I can't leave you alone with...

08:47.614 --> 08:49.969
I mean, uh...

08:50.028 --> 08:51.676
I don't know if I can.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.626
I've never crashed
a train before.

08:53.684 --> 08:55.262
Well, maybe you can
drive the train

08:55.372 --> 08:57.059
without crashing it.

08:57.840 --> 08:58.961
Huh?

08:59.879 --> 09:01.243
Just get
to the control room

09:01.301 --> 09:02.556
and see what you can do.

09:02.614 --> 09:05.528
Fine. Hey, Dewey,
come with me.

09:05.595 --> 09:09.590
I need someone to help me
for some reason.

09:10.028 --> 09:11.291
Just in case.

09:11.358 --> 09:13.001
I'm going to the rear
to see if I can

09:13.059 --> 09:15.270
- detach us from the cave in.
- You, with me.

09:15.328 --> 09:16.665
You've caused us
enough grief.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.421
Aye aye,
Colonel Crumpet.

09:18.488 --> 09:20.961
We'll stay here and be on the
lookout for Terra-Firmians.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.898
It must be about halftime
at The Great Games,

09:22.965 --> 09:24.648
so it'll be easier
to spot one.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.765
Okay.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.107
Just stay put.

09:31.412 --> 09:32.906
After you help us
get out of here

09:32.965 --> 09:34.488
you're never
seeing Webby again.

09:35.023 --> 09:36.222
Ugh, okay, lady,

09:36.280 --> 09:38.233
you are real bad
at asking for help.

09:38.936 --> 09:40.711
Please talk
some sense into Webby.

09:40.778 --> 09:42.528
You don't really believe
that rock monsters

09:42.595 --> 09:44.211
are playing
earthquake games.

09:44.278 --> 09:46.554
Huey's usually right
about nerd stuff.

09:46.631 --> 09:49.174
Not this time.
Those aftershocks

09:49.265 --> 09:51.001
are actually a revolt

09:51.068 --> 09:53.591
led by the lost
Terra-Firmian prince.

09:53.658 --> 09:55.398
He's using the games
as a distraction

09:55.465 --> 09:57.212
to storm the
Califermy Citadel!

09:57.274 --> 09:59.509
It's all in this
artist rendering.

09:59.962 --> 10:01.599
Ooh, that all
sounds awesome.

10:01.658 --> 10:03.032
I want that to be true.

10:03.090 --> 10:04.290
Earthquakes
are a result

10:04.368 --> 10:06.318
of shifting
tectonic plates.

10:06.837 --> 10:09.131
But who's pushing
the plates, Huey?

10:09.198 --> 10:11.076
Who's pushing
the plates?!

10:11.134 --> 10:12.743
Other plates are
pushing the plates.

10:12.954 --> 10:14.727
Now who sounds
ridiculous?

10:14.907 --> 10:16.669
Louie, whose side
are you on?

10:16.727 --> 10:17.791
Oh, neither.
This is just

10:17.858 --> 10:19.398
way more entertaining
than that movie.

10:21.531 --> 10:23.241
What? I got a refill
on the way out.

10:23.299 --> 10:24.789
It's encouraged.

10:25.068 --> 10:27.448
Hmm, probably just some left
over rubble from the cave in.

10:29.149 --> 10:30.818
I'm coming,
Your Highness!

10:32.595 --> 10:33.888
Webby, no!

10:33.946 --> 10:35.171
Please, it's not safe!

10:35.238 --> 10:36.396
Oh, this could be it.

10:36.454 --> 10:37.544
This could be the prince.

10:37.602 --> 10:39.693
This could be...
a rock?

10:39.751 --> 10:42.238
Oh, see? Just a boulder
from the cave in.

10:45.318 --> 10:47.196
Can we go back inside
before we're crushed?

10:47.307 --> 10:49.552
No. Just because
this is only a rock

10:49.610 --> 10:51.876
doesn't mean there aren't
Terra-Firmians still out there.

10:51.934 --> 10:55.188
So we're supposed to examine
every rock in this tunnel?

10:55.470 --> 10:56.990
That actually sounds
pretty fun.

10:57.118 --> 10:58.318
Wait, that's not the point!

11:00.278 --> 11:02.415
Looking good, Tea Time.
Keep it up.

11:02.473 --> 11:03.778
to an accurate analysis,

11:03.840 --> 11:04.961
would be impossible.

11:06.488 --> 11:09.171
This would go a lot faster
if you would give me a hand.

11:09.238 --> 11:11.040
Well, the sooner
I help you, the sooner

11:11.098 --> 11:13.318
I never get to see
my friends again, so...

11:13.385 --> 11:14.446
Ugh.

11:14.509 --> 11:16.454
Want me to go get

11:16.489 --> 11:18.403
one of the more
trustworthy kids to help,

11:18.500 --> 11:20.437
or am I still not allowed
to talk to them?

11:20.602 --> 11:22.063
Do not mouth off to me.

11:22.135 --> 11:24.118
It's your fault
we're in this mess.

11:24.196 --> 11:25.766
Who raised you,
anyway?

11:26.087 --> 11:28.431
I know a bad influence
when I see one.

11:28.782 --> 11:31.204
Those are good children
with bright futures.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.673
Yeah? And what
does that make me?

11:34.112 --> 11:35.821
I don't know.

11:40.454 --> 11:42.891
If you're gonna vandalize,
at least do it right.

11:53.988 --> 11:57.095
So, Dew, it's nice
down here, huh?

11:57.165 --> 11:59.290
Kinda natural for you.

12:00.063 --> 12:01.291
Know what I like?

12:01.431 --> 12:03.641
Dirt. Dirt's pretty
cool and comfy, huh?

12:03.720 --> 12:05.068
No grass to eat
without dirt.

12:05.126 --> 12:08.083
- I guess.
- But I hate the sun.

12:08.141 --> 12:09.232
Not into that.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.238
Gets into your
beady, little eyes.

12:11.305 --> 12:12.921
Makes everything all hot.

12:12.988 --> 12:15.751
Plus, it makes it a lot
harder to possess people.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.236
No, thanks.
Am I right?

12:18.858 --> 12:21.525
Launchpad, do you think
I'm a mole monster?

12:21.752 --> 12:24.791
What? No, no.

12:25.064 --> 12:27.721
Can't believe my best friend
is a mole monster.

12:27.822 --> 12:29.211
I'm your best friend?

12:29.278 --> 12:30.885
Oh, no, it can
hear my thoughts.

12:30.955 --> 12:32.119
Keep it together,
Launchpad.

12:32.189 --> 12:33.697
Gotta change
the subject somehow.

12:33.799 --> 12:35.738
Hey, you know what
we should talk about?

12:35.805 --> 12:38.041
- Another subject.
- Sure.

12:38.314 --> 12:40.799
He doesn't suspect a thing.

12:43.485 --> 12:44.954
- I say one thing.
- You have a very

12:45.017 --> 12:47.186
- active imagination, Webby.
- You are ridiculous!

12:49.674 --> 12:50.991
But this is a rock.

12:51.049 --> 12:52.369
Not a Terra-something.

12:52.427 --> 12:54.453
A stupid rock!

12:54.538 --> 12:55.748
That suddenly disappeared.

12:55.806 --> 12:57.822
Ooh, nice twist.

12:57.970 --> 12:59.988
Um, anything could've
happened to that rock.

13:00.055 --> 13:02.108
- Could've rolled off.
- Rolled off up?

13:02.212 --> 13:03.439
And out of this dent?

13:03.504 --> 13:04.771
I don't think so.

13:04.898 --> 13:06.318
Uh, maybe it disintegrated

13:06.385 --> 13:07.831
or a sudden wormhole.

13:07.898 --> 13:09.548
They're always good for an
unexplained disappearance.

13:09.606 --> 13:11.243
Or we could all be
seeing things

13:11.301 --> 13:12.957
because of a methane gas leak.

13:13.015 --> 13:14.723
Let me check the JWG.

13:16.367 --> 13:18.231
Are we all seeing that?

13:20.746 --> 13:22.258
That? That's, uh,

13:22.318 --> 13:24.129
sparks from
faulty wiring.

13:24.187 --> 13:26.786
Or maybe a crazed sewer
killer with a flashlight?

13:32.716 --> 13:34.747
And I'm still not counting out
a methane gas leak.

13:34.817 --> 13:36.957
Not everything is
a methane gas leak!

13:40.685 --> 13:43.615
- It's gone.
- Oh, that's way creepier.

13:48.658 --> 13:50.130
Aah! My eyes.

13:50.357 --> 13:52.568
Aah! I knew it. Mole man!

13:53.207 --> 13:55.263
Everything I've ever seen
in a movie is real!

14:05.990 --> 14:07.698
Launchpad,
let me in!

14:07.765 --> 14:10.005
Not on your life,
mole man.

14:11.076 --> 14:13.662
Hmm. I suppose you're
good for something.

14:13.732 --> 14:16.131
Ugh, don't hurt yourself with
the compliments, Abbey Road.

14:16.198 --> 14:18.318
- I'm just trying to help.
- All right, I've had it

14:18.385 --> 14:20.474
up to here with your
horrid behavior!

14:35.937 --> 14:37.146
Come on!

15:02.738 --> 15:04.448
This can't be happening!

15:04.675 --> 15:06.050
Down here!

15:18.964 --> 15:20.238
Aah!

15:32.778 --> 15:34.541
- Aah!
- Oh!

15:44.534 --> 15:46.421
Phew! Crashed it.

15:48.818 --> 15:49.992
Back, mole monster!

15:50.050 --> 15:51.238
You can't take me, too!

15:51.305 --> 15:53.331
Mr. McD won't
give me the time off!

15:53.705 --> 15:56.550
Launchpad, it's me, Dewey.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.037
Aah!

15:58.620 --> 15:59.870
Your best friend?

15:59.956 --> 16:01.091
They could be anyone.

16:01.158 --> 16:02.534
They are everywhere.

16:02.659 --> 16:04.858
Yes, anyone could be
a mole monster

16:04.925 --> 16:07.091
in the movie.
This is real life.

16:07.269 --> 16:08.501
Classic mole monster

16:08.568 --> 16:10.308
saying he's "not"
a mole monster.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.511
Ugh! By that logic
how do you know

16:12.573 --> 16:13.625
you're not
a mole monster?

16:13.683 --> 16:15.120
'Cause I'm not.

16:15.667 --> 16:18.550
Which is exactly
what a mole monster would say.

16:19.206 --> 16:22.362
Wait, am I a mole monster?

16:22.728 --> 16:24.331
But I'm a good guy.

16:24.496 --> 16:28.784
Then that means mole monsters
can also be good guys.

16:29.066 --> 16:30.501
Come, mole brother.

16:30.568 --> 16:32.526
This is a new day
for our people.

16:32.584 --> 16:35.597
We will show the world
that we can be good.

16:39.488 --> 16:41.091
Leave her, Lena.

16:41.158 --> 16:42.751
She'll never trust you.

16:42.818 --> 16:44.568
She's keeping you
from them.

16:44.635 --> 16:46.858
Leave her and we'll
be better off.

17:33.730 --> 17:34.987
Aah!

17:40.150 --> 17:41.417
You.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.158
Yeah, me.
Let's go.

17:48.737 --> 17:50.448
- Huey!
- Where are you?

17:50.515 --> 17:51.730
Huey?!

17:59.272 --> 18:01.347
Huey, come on.
We gotta go!

18:01.409 --> 18:03.541
Can't.
Need to stay near the light.

18:03.608 --> 18:05.818
I can still see.
The Junior Woodchuck guidebook

18:05.885 --> 18:07.691
says I'm statistically
safer this way.

18:07.870 --> 18:09.608
If you stay here
you'll be crushed.

18:09.675 --> 18:11.478
At least I'll know
what's crushing me.

18:11.536 --> 18:12.718
Who knows what's out there.

18:13.948 --> 18:15.441
We know what's out there.

18:15.534 --> 18:16.591
Terra-Firmians!

18:16.673 --> 18:18.698
But if they're real,
then what other crazy things

18:18.756 --> 18:20.589
are out there just waiting
for me in the dark?

18:20.725 --> 18:22.015
The only way to know

18:22.073 --> 18:23.925
is to find out together.

18:29.714 --> 18:32.714
Uh, okay,
I didn't see that coming.

18:33.464 --> 18:36.183
Really came together
in the third act.

18:49.808 --> 18:51.276
Mm.

18:51.644 --> 18:53.354
Everyone here?
Everyone okay?

18:53.421 --> 18:55.537
Oh, yeah.
We're A-okay.

18:55.698 --> 18:58.972
Just a couple of
normal non-monster folk

18:59.112 --> 19:00.644
eager to help out.

19:01.534 --> 19:02.672
A way out?

19:02.887 --> 19:03.971
There's a way out!

19:06.652 --> 19:08.480
Huey, wait!

19:08.815 --> 19:10.021
Aah!

19:16.385 --> 19:17.980
Huh?

19:28.675 --> 19:30.425
I told you
they were real.

19:30.557 --> 19:31.753
He must be the prince.

19:31.831 --> 19:34.011
And the others
are his rebel force.

19:34.198 --> 19:36.108
They must've gotten
trapped down here.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.601
This must be the prince

19:37.659 --> 19:40.448
of the bill-faced creatures
of the land above.

19:40.515 --> 19:42.792
And the others
are his rebel force.

19:42.894 --> 19:45.292
I told you
they were real.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.869
Huey!

20:03.785 --> 20:05.026
Boop.

20:11.247 --> 20:12.930
That was interesting.

20:13.050 --> 20:14.615
We still need
to find a way out.

20:15.122 --> 20:16.565
Look!

20:18.958 --> 20:20.974
They smashed us
an exit.

20:25.115 --> 20:27.974
Thank you, fellow
underground creatures.

20:28.326 --> 20:29.751
Sorry I doubted you.

20:29.974 --> 20:31.286
I'm proud of you, Huey.

20:31.388 --> 20:33.898
Facing your fears,
embracing the unknown...

20:34.013 --> 20:36.908
And... loved it!
No longer unknown.

20:36.966 --> 20:39.091
They exist.
Science fact.

20:39.958 --> 20:41.278
That feels
so much better.

20:41.345 --> 20:42.738
Ugh.

20:45.693 --> 20:47.911
I really could get
used to being down here.

20:48.122 --> 20:51.755
I love being
a mole monster!

20:51.911 --> 20:54.326
Launchpad, you are
not a mole monster.

20:54.543 --> 20:57.301
Oh, well, all right.
Makes sense.

21:00.669 --> 21:03.057
Why didn't you leave
the big purple one?

21:03.115 --> 21:05.294
She's getting in the way
of our plans.

21:05.380 --> 21:06.982
Lena.

21:07.167 --> 21:10.247
Listen, dear, I may have been
a bit quick to judge you.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.646
Would you... like to join us
at the mansion for pancakes?

21:13.776 --> 21:15.268
Now, when you say "pancakes"

21:15.326 --> 21:16.872
do you mean like actual pancakes

21:16.951 --> 21:19.898
or English muffins
covered in maple syrup?

21:20.997 --> 21:22.708
I mean actual pancakes.

21:22.943 --> 21:23.990
Then yes.

21:24.107 --> 21:25.637
Lena, you're welcome

21:25.695 --> 21:27.927
at the mansion any time.

21:29.935 --> 21:31.146
That's why.

21:31.318 --> 21:32.948
Gotta play the long game.

21:33.116 --> 21:34.505
Hey, wait up!
