WEBVTT

00:00.072 --> 00:01.188
God, so at first I thought,

00:01.274 --> 00:02.823
do I have, like, a long butt hair?

00:02.909 --> 00:04.275
And then I realized, no.

00:04.360 --> 00:06.527
- It's my head hair.
- Yeah.

00:06.612 --> 00:08.579
- Fall down my back and in my butt crack.
- Yeah! Duh!

00:08.614 --> 00:10.247
- I don't know.
- Okay, we have to go back to the fact

00:10.283 --> 00:14.835
that you are finally going to
vagina-swallow Jeremy tonight.

00:14.921 --> 00:16.420
It's really more of, like, a get-together,

00:16.456 --> 00:18.422
hang out sesh at his apartment.

00:18.458 --> 00:20.040
You know, it's not really
an official date-date.

00:20.126 --> 00:23.427
Yeah, yeah, not official, but yeah.

00:23.463 --> 00:25.012
There's just so much I want
to know about him, like,

00:25.097 --> 00:26.597
I don't know where he went to college,

00:26.632 --> 00:27.848
how many sisters he has.

00:27.934 --> 00:29.216
Oh, he definitely has sisters.

00:29.302 --> 00:31.218
He also definitely doesn't wear underwear.

00:31.304 --> 00:34.054
He's got his junk rolling around
in there all smelly and stuff.

00:34.140 --> 00:35.473
I just want to take it slow, you know?

00:35.525 --> 00:37.641
I really feel like this
can, like, be something.

(Whispering) Sorry to wake you.

09:31.036 --> 09:32.419
Oh...

09:32.454 --> 09:34.287
I volunteered to teach
some underprivileged kids

09:34.373 --> 09:36.456
how to do some woodworking today.

09:36.508 --> 09:37.791
I'm running a little bit late.

09:37.876 --> 09:39.509
Wow, that's beautiful.

09:39.595 --> 09:42.095
Listen, stay as long as you want.

09:43.966 --> 09:44.965

- Okay.
- We know.

10:32.181 --> 10:35.065
Oh, your mom is so
broken up over this loss.

10:35.150 --> 10:36.233
Poor mommy.

10:36.318 --> 10:38.602

10:38.687 --> 10:41.071

right into Bloomberg's pocket.

10:41.156 --> 10:42.606
Bloomberg isn't mayor anymore.

That's what he wants you to think!

10:55.454 --> 10:57.954

11:00.209 --> 11:03.710

You tried to wash a dildo in a dishwasher?

11:21.697 --> 11:22.979
I did indeed.

11:23.065 --> 11:24.531
Well, I don't think you're
here for a staring contest.

11:24.566 --> 11:25.949
- Can I see it?
- Okay.

11:26.034 --> 11:27.734

Whoo, you a pegga!

12:53.876 --> 12:54.825
Okay.

12:54.910 --> 12:56.076
Pega-Seuss!

12:56.128 --> 12:57.410
- Maybe we can talk about it...
- That's you.

12:57.496 --> 12:58.879
Let's talk about it at my house, later.

12:58.914 --> 13:01.047
- Abbi!
- Hi.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.250
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, hi, sweetheart, thanks for coming.

13:03.302 --> 13:04.301
Look at you.

13:04.386 --> 13:05.969
She's glowing, Ilana, look at her.

13:06.054 --> 13:07.470
Oh, my God.

13:07.556 --> 13:09.256
- Ooh, this is a nice bag.
- Thank you so much.

13:09.341 --> 13:11.007
- Italian leather?
- Yeah, I think so.

13:11.093 --> 13:12.592
- Yeah, how's the lining?
- Oh, it's a great lining.

13:12.678 --> 13:14.928
Let me see... I'll be the judge of that.

13:14.980 --> 13:16.096
No, trust me. Trust me.

13:16.181 --> 13:18.231
Abbi Anna Abrams! My mother's freshly dead!

13:18.267 --> 13:19.900
Now let me look at this lining!

13:19.935 --> 13:20.817
Abbi, give it to her.

13:20.903 --> 13:22.686
Ooh, waterproof, love that.

13:22.771 --> 13:23.937
Uh-huh.

13:24.022 --> 13:25.989
Nice backstitch.

13:26.074 --> 13:28.775
You really are a high-class
jewess, let me tell ya.

13:28.861 --> 13:30.193
I told you.

13:30.279 --> 13:33.780
Beautiful, beautiful. Where'd you get this?

13:33.966 --> 13:36.466
Um, you know, it's... um...

13:36.552 --> 13:39.636
You know, that is a... ahem.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.271
Do I need to keep going?

13:41.306 --> 13:42.556
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

13:42.641 --> 13:43.974
No, no, hold on. Peg?

13:44.026 --> 13:45.142
What's peg?

13:45.194 --> 13:47.944
Pegging is when a woman with a strap-on,

13:47.980 --> 13:50.147
with a dildo, penetrates a man.

13:50.232 --> 13:53.366
Oh, but wouldn't that be
more like a gay thing, Elliot?

13:53.452 --> 13:56.036
No, I mean, how would I put
a dildo on top of my dick?

13:56.121 --> 13:57.404
That's true.

13:57.489 --> 14:00.707
Straight men and gay men alike
both enjoy prostate stimulation.

14:00.793 --> 14:02.626
And it's very popular with married couples.

14:02.661 --> 14:03.794
- Oh.
- Is it?

14:03.829 --> 14:04.828
Probably.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.962
(Bobbi) We were at the Millers' once.

14:05.998 --> 14:07.714
It turned out it was a swingers party.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.965
- No!
- Oh, wow.

14:09.001 --> 14:10.667
Yeah, but we didn't have
sex with anybody, just...

14:10.753 --> 14:12.552
you know, but we stayed
'cause the food was incredible.

14:12.638 --> 14:14.971
Yes, and we also stayed
because the owner's child

14:15.007 --> 14:17.224
had died of an overdose and
we wanted to be supportive.

14:17.309 --> 14:18.892
Out of support.

14:18.977 --> 14:20.560
But Abbi, good for you
for trying something new,

14:20.646 --> 14:21.895
that is terrific.

14:21.980 --> 14:24.181
I can't really believe
that we're talking about it,

14:24.233 --> 14:27.017
because, you know, Ilana was
telling me about grandma Esther

14:27.069 --> 14:29.519
and how she... she lived with no regrets.

14:29.605 --> 14:32.689
And it made me think, we all
need to live more like that,

14:32.741 --> 14:34.658
you know, like, I kind of feel like I...

14:34.693 --> 14:35.659
Yeah, I pegged.

14:35.694 --> 14:37.194
Yeah, I pegged,

14:37.246 --> 14:40.080
<i>but I kind of did it for
Grandma Esther, you know?</i>

14:40.165 --> 14:41.865
In a way.

14:41.950 --> 14:43.533
(Sobbing) Oh, it's okay.

14:43.619 --> 14:45.368
Oh, it's all right.

14:45.420 --> 14:46.670
Mom, feel something!

14:46.705 --> 14:49.206
I'm feeling the inside of this bag, okay?

14:52.127 --> 14:54.928
I promise I will never, ever
tell anybody about your fart.

14:55.013 --> 14:55.962
I love you.

14:56.048 --> 14:57.964
Elliot, come on, we gotta get out of here.

14:58.050 --> 14:59.516
- (Phone alert)
- Gotta get the car.

14:59.551 --> 15:01.051

- (Dad) Don't dawdle.

15:01.136 --> 15:02.135
- _
- Say hi to the dog.

15:02.221 --> 15:04.437
I got somewhere, I, um, need to be.

15:04.523 --> 15:06.056
All right, don't forget to wear a condom.

15:06.108 --> 15:08.558
Or not... I don't know what's
appropriate in this situation.

15:08.644 --> 15:09.693
I don't know, either.

15:09.728 --> 15:11.611
Listen to me: Get that ass.

15:11.697 --> 15:14.396
- Maybe I will.
- Bye, Ab.

15:14.448 --> 15:15.814
All I am calling it.

15:15.899 --> 15:17.199
(Phone vibrating inside suitcase)

15:17.234 --> 15:20.068
God damn it, I must've left
it in one of the friggin' bags.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.169
Why would you do that?

15:21.255 --> 15:23.171
All right, let's open this up.

15:23.257 --> 15:24.089
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:24.174 --> 15:25.173
Don't put 'em on the filthy floor!

15:25.225 --> 15:26.475
Where's the pashmina?

15:26.510 --> 15:28.844
Get the pashmina out.

15:28.896 --> 15:30.846
- I put this pashmina around my neck!
- It doesn't matter.

15:30.898 --> 15:34.099
- Bags, bags, bags. Lots of bags!
- Bags, bags, bags!

15:34.184 --> 15:36.184
One bag, two bag, three bag, four.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.519
Bags, bags, bags.

15:37.571 --> 15:39.354
Five bags, six bags, seven bags, more.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.822
(Both) Jesus Christ.

15:43.364 --> 15:44.797
(Both women shouting)

15:44.882 --> 15:46.131
Clearly, I'm gonna be
late to pick up my spread

15:46.217 --> 15:47.683
from Zabar's for Shiva tomorrow!

15:47.768 --> 15:49.051
I think the real crooks down on
Wall Street should be arrested!

15:49.136 --> 15:50.469
Reverse Robin Hoods who take from the poor

15:50.554 --> 15:51.770
and give to their rich friends...

15:51.806 --> 15:53.105
I guess I'm gonna use
my call to call Zabar's,

15:53.140 --> 15:54.306
'cause if you don't pick your order up...

15:54.392 --> 15:55.607
You get on their (Bleep) list...

15:55.643 --> 15:59.427
Ivy League grad/Harvard...

15:59.513 --> 16:01.095
You can bet your ass
I'm gonna sue the NYPD!

16:01.181 --> 16:02.847
... and little boy prostitutes!

16:02.933 --> 16:05.683
Guess we're being let off easy
'cause we're extremely white.

16:05.769 --> 16:07.986
Yeah, that's the prison
industrial complex for you.

16:08.021 --> 16:09.521
Wanna get back in the car?

16:09.573 --> 16:12.023
We just want to make
sure our voices are heard.

16:12.108 --> 16:13.274
They were... you're very loud.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.359
Yeah, thank you.

16:14.444 --> 16:15.944
Now we'll just take our handbags and go.

16:16.029 --> 16:17.328
We can't give you the bags.

16:17.364 --> 16:19.247
They're evidence in an ongoing
counterfeit investigation.

16:19.332 --> 16:21.165
- Enjoy your new handbags!
- "Ongoing".

16:21.201 --> 16:22.200
Yeah!

16:23.453 --> 16:26.120
Hello, Zabar's? It's Bobbi Wexler.

16:26.206 --> 16:27.789
Don't you yell at me!

16:34.798 --> 16:35.797
(Whispering) Wait.

16:35.882 --> 16:38.299
Hold on, I'll be right back.

16:49.896 --> 16:51.896
Wait, what is that?

16:51.948 --> 16:53.648
It... it's a dildo.

16:55.735 --> 16:58.570
Um... it's not my dildo.

16:58.622 --> 17:00.655
Okay, so it's stupid.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.240
When you left yesterday,

17:02.292 --> 17:05.326
I put yours in the dishwasher
and it... it melted it.

17:05.412 --> 17:06.828
So I was like, I gotta get you a new one

17:06.913 --> 17:09.547
'cause I ruined your thing
and I went to the sex store,

17:09.583 --> 17:11.465
and I got one that looks just like yours,

17:11.550 --> 17:13.084
except this one's brand new.

17:13.169 --> 17:16.588
I really appreciate you doing that, I do,

17:16.640 --> 17:20.391
but mine was a shinjo.

17:20.426 --> 17:23.227
And that's, like, a cheap knockoff.

17:23.262 --> 17:27.265
$79, I feel it could get the job done.

17:27.317 --> 17:31.736
Um, it's just that a shinjo
is custom-made for my body,

17:31.771 --> 17:34.772
and it's made out of
all-natural materials...

17:34.858 --> 17:36.441
Totally, totally. I know that you love

17:36.493 --> 17:37.859
to be, like, particular about your stuff,

17:37.944 --> 17:39.494
- I was just, like, gonna go...
- Wait, wait.

17:39.579 --> 17:40.778
What does that mean?

17:40.864 --> 17:42.497
No, it's just, like, your whole thing.

17:42.582 --> 17:45.249
You like your stuff to
be specialty and curated.

17:45.285 --> 17:46.117
I get it.

17:46.169 --> 17:48.786
Like what?

17:48.872 --> 17:51.289
Like, the cider beer, the cardamom?

17:51.341 --> 17:53.257
You have a kimono area.

17:53.293 --> 17:54.626
I mean, look at this apartment.

17:54.711 --> 17:56.628
Jeremy, I feel like we're in a magazine.

17:56.713 --> 17:57.845
In a good way.

17:57.931 --> 17:59.213
It's what I like about you.

17:59.299 --> 18:00.465
I guess I just didn't
realize you were judging me

18:00.550 --> 18:01.766
based on my stuff.

18:01.801 --> 18:03.217
I'm not judging you,

18:03.303 --> 18:05.520
I mean, I pegged you last
night without any judgment.

18:05.605 --> 18:06.854
Why would you judge that?

18:06.940 --> 18:08.139
I didn't.

18:08.191 --> 18:09.273
And I did it on the first night.

18:09.309 --> 18:10.525
I'm cool.

18:10.610 --> 18:12.560
Abbi, bragging about not judging something

18:12.646 --> 18:14.395
just means that you
think it should be judged.

18:14.481 --> 18:16.481
No, I don't... I'm not...

18:16.566 --> 18:19.951
bragging about not judging or judging.

18:19.986 --> 18:21.619
I'm not bragging or judging.

18:21.655 --> 18:22.654
This is silly.

18:22.706 --> 18:23.821
I had fun last night.

18:23.873 --> 18:25.156
I liked it.

18:25.241 --> 18:27.659
Can we just begin this again?

18:27.711 --> 18:29.994
And do it again with that cheap knockoff?

18:30.080 --> 18:31.212
I'll probably get a rash.

18:31.297 --> 18:32.997
79 bucks!

18:33.049 --> 18:35.383
Did you seriously think that
you were just gonna stick that

18:35.468 --> 18:39.170
inside of me and I wouldn't
feel the difference?

18:39.222 --> 18:40.171
Yeah.

18:40.223 --> 18:44.258
(Sighing) Now you're just being childish.

18:44.344 --> 18:45.727
<i>I'm being childish?</i>

18:45.812 --> 18:47.061
Yes.

18:47.147 --> 18:50.348
I (Bleep) you in the ass

18:50.400 --> 18:53.601
the first night that we did anything, okay?

18:53.687 --> 18:56.354
I think that's pretty (Bleep) mature.

18:56.406 --> 18:58.606
Plus, you're throwing,
like, a temper tantrum

18:58.692 --> 19:02.276
'cause you don't have your
specialty leather-blown dildo

19:02.362 --> 19:03.277
or whatever.

19:03.363 --> 19:04.412
You're being an idiot right now.

19:04.497 --> 19:05.863
Leather is tanned!

19:05.949 --> 19:07.365
It's not blown, like glass.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.200
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not a leathersmith.

19:09.285 --> 19:10.334
You know what?

19:10.370 --> 19:13.037
The only reason I pegged
you in the first place

19:13.089 --> 19:15.039
is because Ilana's grandmother died

19:15.091 --> 19:16.424
and she (Bleep) Little Richard.

19:16.509 --> 19:17.542
Cool!

19:17.627 --> 19:18.676
It's really cool.

19:18.712 --> 19:19.711
Real mature.

19:19.763 --> 19:22.180
You know what, Abbi?

19:22.215 --> 19:23.631
I... I think you should go.

19:23.717 --> 19:24.549
<i>Well, I think that I should go.</i>

19:24.634 --> 19:26.300
Also, maybe you want to do me a favor

19:26.386 --> 19:28.302
and try to keep the Alanis Morissette down?

19:28.388 --> 19:30.471
I mean, who... who blasts "thank you"?

19:30.557 --> 19:34.892
Now who's judging other people
based on their... their stuff?

19:34.944 --> 19:36.611
Real mature!

19:36.696 --> 19:40.398
Also, a (Bleep) ton of people
play that song and love it!

19:40.450 --> 19:41.566
Headphones.

19:45.205 --> 19:46.571
If we get to Chinatown
in the next ten minutes,

19:46.623 --> 19:47.739
we can make it.

19:47.791 --> 19:48.706
What... why?

19:48.742 --> 19:49.907
I... I need more bags.

19:49.993 --> 19:51.576
Mom, we just got arrested!

19:51.628 --> 19:53.544
You don't understand...
I have to have the bags!

19:53.580 --> 19:55.580
- If I don't have them, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
- Mom!

19:55.632 --> 19:56.631
- Mom, mom, mom, mom...
- What, what?

19:56.716 --> 20:00.418
The bags are gone. Let it go.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.921
I never got to say goodbye.

20:03.973 --> 20:05.723
The bags know, mom. They know.

20:05.759 --> 20:08.259
Hey, you're blocking the
whole (Bleep) sidewalk!

20:08.311 --> 20:09.510
(Both women shouting)

20:09.596 --> 20:11.145
Who the hell are you, you
disrespectful mother(Bleep)?

20:11.231 --> 20:12.597
So walk around us, you
patriarchal mother(Bleep)!

20:12.649 --> 20:14.265
Who do you think you are,
talking to us that way?

20:14.350 --> 20:15.600
What is wrong with you?

20:15.685 --> 20:16.851
You move around us, (Bleep) face!

20:16.936 --> 20:18.102
I'll (Bleep) murder you, you little bitch!

20:18.188 --> 20:19.771
You cross the street!

20:19.823 --> 20:21.773
- I love you so much.
- You are my world.

20:21.825 --> 20:23.668
You are my everything, I think
about you all day, every day.

20:26.282 --> 20:27.730
I'm gonna have to, like,
jump out the window.

20:27.850 --> 20:29.732
You know, this is a good
thing that this all happened.

20:29.818 --> 20:32.769
Your crush on Jeremy was holding
you back and now you're free.

20:32.854 --> 20:34.020
You're right.

20:34.105 --> 20:35.071
I'm wild.

20:35.156 --> 20:36.239
- Yeah.
- I'm a wild lady.

20:36.324 --> 20:37.523
Ugh!

20:37.609 --> 20:39.158
You know what? I'm gonna delete his texts.

20:39.194 --> 20:41.160
There's only four, but they're gone.

20:41.196 --> 20:42.662
You're gonna find someone else to peg.

20:42.697 --> 20:45.498
There are infinite holes in the sea.

20:45.533 --> 20:48.868
Maybe even, I don't know...

20:48.920 --> 20:50.336
Girl holes?

20:50.372 --> 20:52.288
I'm not pegging you, dude.

20:52.374 --> 20:54.540
You gotta stop bringing it up.

20:54.626 --> 20:56.926
I think I want to master regular sex first.

20:57.012 --> 20:59.178
At least you found a
good use for that dildo.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.463
Right?

21:00.548 --> 21:02.048
It's perfect.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.549
I want one.

21:03.635 --> 21:04.717
It was 79 bucks.

21:04.803 --> 21:05.852
Ugh!

21:05.887 --> 21:07.969
I could find it cheaper in Chinatown.

21:14.070 --> 21:16.632
Oh, and also, I'm back
on ***. I like them again.

21:16.633 --> 21:18.633
Oh, my God. That's so good.

21:19.634 --> 21:20.620
So...

21:22.501 --> 21:23.573
did you give it any more thought?

21:23.574 --> 21:25.622
Uh, weel, yeah, as a
matter of fact, I did...

21:25.823 --> 21:29.245
and... well, I haven't
changed my mind, so...

21:29.746 --> 21:32.246
Just open up your mind,
Arthur, just open up.

21:32.247 --> 21:35.845
My mind is very open. My
asshole, I'm not so sure about it.

21:36.446 --> 21:37.979
Forgot about precious asshole.

21:37.980 --> 21:40.745
But my asshole is fair game, of course!

21:43.946 --> 21:46.076
Fine, I'll pick one up
at the mall tomorrow.

21:46.077 --> 21:47.177
Thank you.

21:48.078 --> 21:50.290
Lot of condolences emails to answer.
