You saved my ass.
I owe you one.

That's me.

02:32.265 --> 02:34.233
You ride the circuit?
Bulls. You?

02:34.301 --> 02:36.360

at the grounds.

02:36.436 --> 02:39.928
Nah. No more rodeo for me.
Pop's into oil up in Alaska.

02:42.409 --> 02:44.639
Thinks we're going
to strike it rich.

02:44.711 --> 02:46.576
Yeah, you're gonna freeze
your ass off up there.

02:46.913 --> 02:47.902
Yeah, probably.

Yeah, you too.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.974
Well, how'd he do?

04:58.144 --> 04:59.702
He's kinda lazy.

05:06.953 --> 05:08.978
Looks like
he's falling asleep.

When is the race?

05:11.992 --> 05:13.619
Sunday.

05:16.363 --> 05:17.830
You know, maybe, uh...

05:17.897 --> 05:19.865
Maybe try some
of those vitamins.

a bowed tendon, and our
biggest owner walking away...

more horses to train,
we gonna be out of business.

05:40.854 --> 05:43.345
Well, we got four running
this week.

05:43.423 --> 05:44.981
Should be favored
on a couple of 'em.

05:45.892 --> 05:48.190
We're 0 for 28 this meet.

05:55.735 --> 05:57.259
We got three seconds.

05:58.738 --> 06:01.366
See... What don't you
understand, huh?

06:02.809 --> 06:05.744
Owners don't wanna run second.

06:05.812 --> 06:07.643
They want their picture taken.

06:08.848 --> 06:11.043
That'd be
in the winner's circle.

06:18.525 --> 06:20.288
Give me another one, Gus.

06:21.861 --> 06:23.829

tight around here.

So, Chip, you got
any long shots for us?

06:56.396 --> 06:59.422
Oh, you're kidding.
That's all he's ever got.

06:59.499 --> 07:02.900
Last time he won a race,
my wife was a virgin.

07:03.303 --> 07:04.964
(LAUGHING)
Oh.

07:05.038 --> 07:08.007

07:38.338 --> 07:41.273

next week, Miguel. Sorry, man.

07:50.850 --> 07:52.112
Hey, there, boys.

07:53.686 --> 07:55.119

Where'd that come from?

08:05.565 --> 08:08.056
That... That right there

08:08.134 --> 08:11.035
is evidence of some
serious card sharking.

08:11.104 --> 08:13.698
Those boys down at Gus's,
they don't know what hit 'em.

08:13.773 --> 08:17.800
I drew two flushes,
two on the river,

08:17.877 --> 08:20.573
and I wiped them suckers out.

08:21.381 --> 08:24.111
Well, we got a race tomorrow
and you can barely stand up.

08:24.184 --> 08:27.381
God! Stop your bitching, Bill!

08:28.121 --> 08:30.089

is over. You?

better than me.

Kelly's gotta take a leak,
so he gets up.

so I start pissing all over
the back of Kelly's jeans.

13:02.495 --> 13:03.484
No, no, no, no, no.

13:03.563 --> 13:06.896

as hell until he turns around.

Sorry to call so late,

quarter horses. I got no
interest in thoroughbreds.

He's all American,
bred in Kentucky.

15:48.361 --> 15:51.159
He can't run the big races
in Canada as a three-year-old.

Welcome, Mr. Woolley.
Please, make yourself at home.

16:41.380 --> 16:42.472
Thank you.

16:48.521 --> 16:51.217
Can I get you anything
to drink before we take off?

16:53.659 --> 16:55.627
Mmm-hmm.

16:58.331 --> 17:01.596
Bird's been real special
for me. He's real special.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.862
Knew what he was supposed
to do from the word go.

17:03.969 --> 17:06.961
I saw you picked him up
at auction for only $9500.

17:07.039 --> 17:10.202
We stole him that night.
Thought he'd go
for a lot more.

17:10.976 --> 17:13.205
Never know where that next
jewel shows up.

17:13.979 --> 17:16.174
Told you he won three stakes
in a row, eh?

17:16.382 --> 17:19.249
Well, not many two-year-olds
put that on their resume.

17:19.318 --> 17:20.683
Then why are you selling him?

17:20.752 --> 17:23.813
Buy low, sell high.
That's what I do.

17:29.929 --> 17:31.123
Uh...

17:31.197 --> 17:32.596
He does this
from time to time.

17:37.503 --> 17:39.698
He usually doesn't go too far.

17:45.544 --> 17:46.602
WOMAN:
Easy, Bird.

17:47.213 --> 17:48.237
MAN:
Come on, you dope.

17:51.917 --> 17:53.009
WOMAN: Easy.

17:53.152 --> 17:54.244
That's it. Come on, Bird.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.753
Kinda small, ain't he?

17:57.390 --> 17:59.221
And a little crooked up front.

17:59.992 --> 18:01.550
So was Seabiscuit.

18:02.161 --> 18:03.150
Come on, buddy.

18:03.229 --> 18:04.287
MAN: Come here, boy.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.665
(WHINNYING)

18:15.875 --> 18:17.604
Sure got a mind of his own.

18:23.149 --> 18:24.673
You seen him
on the track yet?

18:25.351 --> 18:28.218
I don't think
it's worth it, Mark.
<i>Well, you made the trip.</i>

18:28.287 --> 18:30.915
Yeah, but I just...
I don't think
he's what you're after.

18:32.391 --> 18:34.222
He walks funny, for one.

18:36.328 --> 18:39.923
Hey, look, I had braces
on my legs as a kid
'cause I walked funny, too.

18:39.999 --> 18:41.296
Let's give him a try.

18:41.434 --> 18:42.731
Okay.

19:16.435 --> 19:18.232
That was a 46 flat.

19:18.370 --> 19:20.133
What'd I tell ya?

19:21.440 --> 19:22.532
What changed?

19:22.608 --> 19:24.473
<i>You don't even notice</i>
<i>he's crooked when he runs.</i>

19:24.543 --> 19:26.477
<i>The little shit</i>
<i>barely touches the ground.</i>

19:26.545 --> 19:29.810
He's got perfect action,
real professional and

19:30.683 --> 19:31.911
he's fast.

19:32.117 --> 19:33.379
<i>Yeah, but a gelding?</i>

19:34.086 --> 19:36.680
CHIP: Oh, forget about
breeding. This one's a runner.

19:38.023 --> 19:39.820
You sure he's sound?

19:39.892 --> 19:41.951
<i>There's not a pimple</i>
<i>on him, Mark.</i>

19:42.161 --> 19:44.789
Hey, you want this horse.

19:48.901 --> 19:51.631
All right, sit tight.
I'm on my way to Doc's.

19:52.972 --> 19:55.304
MARK: <i>Come on, we always</i>
<i>talked about owning</i>
<i>a thoroughbred together.</i>

19:55.374 --> 19:58.036
Breeders' Cup
is in California in 10 days.

19:58.511 --> 20:00.376
If we wanna do this,
we gotta get moving.

20:00.446 --> 20:02.778
Four hundred seems
like a lot of money.

20:02.848 --> 20:05.442
Hell, if he just runs second,
we got our money back.

20:05.518 --> 20:07.816
And if he don't run second,

20:07.920 --> 20:10.684
we bought ourselves
a very expensive pony.

20:12.057 --> 20:15.584
You know I don't like taking
leaps like this, sight unseen.

20:15.661 --> 20:17.492
He's already won $300,000.

20:18.163 --> 20:19.221
I don't know.

20:20.633 --> 20:23.261
I'll tell you what then.
I'll buy him.

20:24.803 --> 20:28.466
I'll buy him myself.
You like what you see,
I'll cut you in.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.433
(CHUCKLING)

20:32.578 --> 20:34.136
Ah, shit. I'm in.

(SLOSHING)

20:36.081 --> 20:37.981
(LAUGHING)

20:53.966 --> 20:55.991
CHIP: There he is, No. 9.

20:56.702 --> 20:58.294
That's all of him, huh?

20:59.104 --> 21:01.095
He's only two.
He'll grow some.

21:03.108 --> 21:07.306
Well, he'd better hurry up
'cause he's not looking
too good at 24 to 1.

21:08.180 --> 21:11.980
Don't you worry, Doc.
He's gonna do great.

21:12.051 --> 21:14.849
If Chip says he can run,
he can run.

21:16.522 --> 21:20.549
Baffert and the sheik
got the favorite, Midshipman.

21:23.028 --> 21:24.017
Howdy.

21:33.639 --> 21:36.301
DOC: I guess we're gonna
find out what we got
pretty quick.

21:37.209 --> 21:40.645

21:51.090 --> 21:53.422

<i>Here's Mine That Bird</i>

21:55.794 --> 21:57.625

21:57.696 --> 22:02.133
<i>Then we come back to Terrain.</i>
<i>Gallant Son has to go</i>
<i>a little wide into the turn.</i>

22:02.201 --> 22:04.192
<i>In behind there</i>

22:04.269 --> 22:06.169
<i>and Munnings races</i>
<i>towards the rear.</i>

22:06.238 --> 22:09.105
<i>The pace is good,</i>
<i>12 lengths from first to last.</i>

22:09.174 --> 22:12.075
I mean, he's in there.
He's doing good.

22:12.144 --> 22:13.168
Yeah.

22:13.245 --> 22:16.373
ANNOUNCER: <i>Now they've settled</i>
<i>in with Mine That Bird</i>
<i>a comfortable fifth,</i>

22:16.448 --> 22:18.348

<i>Then back</i>

22:20.753 --> 22:22.380
<i>Bushranger is on the far side.</i>

22:22.454 --> 22:25.651
<i>Terrain giving them</i>
<i>eight lengths start</i>
<i>and then comes Gallant Son.</i>

22:25.724 --> 22:29.490
<i>Behind that Azul Leon,</i>

<i>the rear.</i>

22:29.561 --> 22:34.021
<i>Into the far turn they go.</i>
<i>And it's Midshipman</i>

23:01.694 --> 23:04.822
<i>Then came Terrain, behind</i>
<i>that Pioneer of the Nile,</i>

23:04.930 --> 23:07.797
<i>and Mine That Bird</i>
<i>finished last.</i>

23:09.168 --> 23:10.635
I'm getting too old for this.

23:10.769 --> 23:12.236
Where's the bar?

23:12.404 --> 23:13.666
Whoo!

23:14.106 --> 23:15.471
(LAUGHING)

23:15.541 --> 23:16.667
Come on!

23:31.757 --> 23:33.418
Why'd you hire him?

23:36.462 --> 23:38.453
Doc, he's only had the horse
a week.

23:41.633 --> 23:46.093
We bought ourselves a champion
and he run dead last.
What's that tell ya?

23:47.139 --> 23:49.664
Bird's never run
on synthetic track before.

23:50.342 --> 23:52.367
It ain't the track, Mark.

23:53.378 --> 23:56.779
This guy's going nowhere.
He's got a terrible record.

23:56.849 --> 23:58.646
Yeah, maybe.

24:00.853 --> 24:03.151
But he's got a great record
with me.

24:07.493 --> 24:10.485
This can't be personal.
We're running a business here.

24:10.562 --> 24:11.722
I know that.

24:12.397 --> 24:15.696
And we've got some
hard decisions to make.

24:16.969 --> 24:19.961
I'm saying three strikes
and he's out.

24:22.841 --> 24:24.570
That's a bit harsh, Doc.

24:31.717 --> 24:32.945
So is losing.

Good luck to you, Case.

27:14.046 --> 27:15.035
Thanks, Doc.

27:15.113 --> 27:17.172
Listen up,
he's a one run horse.

27:17.249 --> 27:20.650
You need to keep him covered
up till the three-eighths
pole, then let him roll.

27:20.719 --> 27:22.778
I don't want him on the lead
till ya hit that wire.

Casey made his move

Bird didn't have nothing left.

He shoulda. Ain't like he was
running against much.

28:23.281 --> 28:24.839
Yeah, well, at least
we got second.

Mr. Woolley.
Yes, sir.

32:04.002 --> 32:05.970
Your brother came through
surgery just fine.

32:06.338 --> 32:08.135
But the breaks in his leg
are very serious.

32:08.673 --> 32:11.801
There's a plate and 12 screws
holding the bones together.

32:11.876 --> 32:15.141
So he's got to stay off
that leg or it won't
heal properly.

32:15.547 --> 32:19.313
He'll be in recovery another
half an hour.
You can visit with him then.

32:19.384 --> 32:20.851

That's all he's got.

32:37.602 --> 32:39.502
We'll move him to my place.

32:41.072 --> 32:43.438
I got plenty of folks
that'll help him out.

32:53.885 --> 32:56.046
Sorry, this one didn't go
through either.

32:57.022 --> 33:01.083
Maybe try to put half
on this card

33:01.159 --> 33:02.820

and I'm a dead man.

33:38.163 --> 33:40.324
Yeah, had me
a little accident.

33:43.401 --> 33:46.234
Thought for a minute
I might not see you again.

33:49.841 --> 33:50.967
I know...

33:52.310 --> 33:55.802
I know things ain't exactly
worked out so far,
Bird, but...

33:56.614 --> 33:59.174
Yeah, that ain't your fault.
It's mine.

34:00.752 --> 34:02.242

this to wake me up.

to run in the Kentucky Derby!
