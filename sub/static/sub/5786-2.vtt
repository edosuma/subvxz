00:00.961 --> 00:02.587
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.796 --> 00:04.422
This is all we have.
One dose of the cure.

00:04.631 --> 00:05.799
<i>You turned me
into a zombie.</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:08.969
- Rather than watch you die.
- You let me check myself into
a mental hospital.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.845
You let me think I was crazy.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.889
- Whatever happens now,
I hope you can forgive me.
- Liv?

00:13.098 --> 00:14.432
I get it. You're not
talking to me.

00:14.641 --> 00:15.809
I just need some time.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.978
What do I need to
replicate the cure?

00:18.186 --> 00:20.814
Ah, yes. The tainted
Utopium from the night
of the boat massacre.

00:21.022 --> 00:21.648
Hey, Dad!

00:21.815 --> 00:24.609
<i>I showed up
to train a new client today,
and he was a zombie.</i>

00:24.818 --> 00:26.403
We've solved
the zombie problem.

00:26.611 --> 00:28.113
<i>We've located the instrument
of their destruction.</i>

00:28.321 --> 00:29.155
<i>There are zombies
living among us.</i>

00:29.364 --> 00:30.907
You want me to kill them?

00:31.116 --> 00:32.325
- Yes.
- You've got the wrong
man for the job.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.244
We do know of one zombie,
Liv Moore.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.413
I've got you over a barrel,
big guy.

00:36.621 --> 00:39.541
- Hey, roomie. How was work?
- You would not believe
the guy we hired.

00:39.749 --> 00:40.667
Ahh!

00:45.588 --> 00:47.966
<i>My father has been missing
for two days now.</i>

00:48.174 --> 00:50.760
<i>He's six-feet tall with brown
hair and brown eyes.</i>

00:53.513 --> 00:59.436
<i>If you've seen him, or heard
of anything at all, please
contact the Seattle Police.</i>

00:59.644 --> 01:01.896
<i>Please help us find our dad.</i>

01:02.105 --> 01:04.983
<i>We love him so much
and we just want
him to come home.</i>

01:05.191 --> 01:08.069
<i>Verna,
Verna, over here.
I have a question.</i>

01:14.743 --> 01:18.663
Friends, Romans, countrymen,

01:18.872 --> 01:23.168
lend me your beers!

01:23.376 --> 01:28.798
Four score and seven years
ago, and something,
something... Hail Caesar!

01:33.344 --> 01:34.679
Yo! What up, furry?

01:42.687 --> 01:45.065
Party foul!

02:21.226 --> 02:23.228
What happened to Caesar?

02:23.436 --> 02:26.022
Oh, he came, he saw,
he was stabbed several times
in quick succession

02:26.231 --> 02:28.566
with a sharp
cylindrical object.

02:28.775 --> 02:31.152
Likely an ice pick.
This is Chad Wolcoff.

02:31.361 --> 02:33.279
He was the pledge captain
for Zeta Beta Theta.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.240
Wait, don't move.

02:40.036 --> 02:42.038
These look like
the exact vials
from the boat party

02:42.247 --> 02:44.124
that contained
the tainted Utopium.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.417
Ravi, I'm pretty sure that
all Utopium comes
in vials like that.

02:46.626 --> 02:50.463
- Oh.
- And FYI, if you find the cure
for zombie-ism on this floor,

02:50.672 --> 02:52.757
I may opt
to keep eating brains.

02:52.966 --> 02:55.969
Room packed with people,
a guy gets stabbed
multiple times,

02:56.177 --> 02:57.804
and no one saw anything.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.098
- Seriously?
- I'm really gonna need
a hand with this,

03:00.306 --> 03:02.392
so let me know when things
get extrasensory.

03:04.936 --> 03:07.772
Well, I hope you like
Jager bombs
and homoerotic subtext.

03:16.948 --> 03:18.575
<i>- Can you meet me upstairs?</i>
- Yes.

03:22.954 --> 03:23.997
And so it begins...

03:29.043 --> 03:32.088
- You know what I fear
more than death?
- Love?

03:32.297 --> 03:35.049
Unrealized potential.

03:35.216 --> 03:39.804
I am overflowing with
potential, and I'm tapping
every last drop.

03:40.013 --> 03:43.808
How about you, Speedy?
You realizing your potential?

03:44.017 --> 03:47.145
I don't know if I'm
overflowing but, yeah.

03:47.353 --> 03:51.191
- All that stuff you said.
- That self-doubt?
That's Mr. Boss talking.

03:51.399 --> 03:54.944
We always said we wanted
more. More responsibility,
more money.

03:55.153 --> 03:57.197
I wanted to be alive to really
get to enjoy those things.

03:59.199 --> 04:02.160
He's not gonna take too
kindly to us moving in
on his Utopium trade.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.162
Hey, this is our time.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.748
Our product is better than
that glorified ecstasy he sells.

04:06.915 --> 04:07.832
Higher highs.

04:08.041 --> 04:08.958
Lower lows.

04:10.335 --> 04:11.461
Just saying.

04:11.669 --> 04:14.505
We're going to undercut
Mr. Boss' prices.

04:14.714 --> 04:18.509
Four dealers.
Four of the hottest clubs.
Opposite ends of the city.

04:18.718 --> 04:20.887
By the time Mr. Boss
knows what hit him,

04:21.095 --> 04:22.931
customers are gonna be
knocking down our door.

04:23.139 --> 04:26.768
And I've got
a big-ass roll of Benjamins.
Boys answering to me.

04:26.935 --> 04:28.519
Yes. Now...

04:28.728 --> 04:30.688
Our sales staff, did you find
what we were looking for?

04:30.897 --> 04:33.191
Upscale types, like you said.

04:33.399 --> 04:36.819
Rich kids whose daddies
cut them off.
Not the usual creepers.

04:37.028 --> 04:39.989
I don't want to know anything.
I'm just the little man
behind the curtain.

04:40.198 --> 04:44.494
No one needs to know I exist.
This is your show, okay?

04:44.702 --> 04:46.829
A year from now,
we'll be running this city.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.207
Your lips to God's ears.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.709
- Go. Go get 'em.
- Yeah.

04:57.048 --> 04:58.341
Sounds like a risky plan.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.637
Oh, and what?
You're the plan guy?

05:02.845 --> 05:06.557
Now, any progress finding
that guy who cut
the tainted Utopium?

05:06.766 --> 05:10.603
- Got a couple leads.
- Allow me to light
a fire under you.

05:10.812 --> 05:13.273
Do you know why
your brother was
institutionalized?

05:13.481 --> 05:18.111
Because he was crazy.
He heard voices.
He saw things.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.656
And the loony SOB
thought there were zombies
running around Seattle.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.157
That's just silly.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.829
Sometimes they just loiter.

05:28.037 --> 05:30.957
Chief, did I say
you could lick the bowl?

05:35.378 --> 05:38.089
It's, like, unthinkable that
someone murdered Chad.

05:38.298 --> 05:40.425
No, like, seriously,
I can't even think it.

05:40.633 --> 05:46.514
He was more than just
a frat brother. He was, like,
a brother-brother, bro.

05:46.723 --> 05:48.182
For real.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.560
Oh, hey, I think
we killed that.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.647
- What are you doing?
- Coaxing the flow to the hose.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.823
Did Chad have any enemies
that you know of?

06:04.032 --> 06:06.743
No way, man.
Chad was the freaking best.

06:06.951 --> 06:08.911
- Everybody loved him.
- Well, not everybody.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.621
I mean, someone
stabbed him to death.

06:11.706 --> 06:12.665
No disrespect, bro.

06:12.874 --> 06:14.250
No, no, bro. I feel you.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.003
Valid point.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.547
That person might be
a complete knob,
but they're out there.

06:19.756 --> 06:23.134
I don't know, like, who do you
guys know who totally sucks?

06:23.343 --> 06:25.178
Actually,
that's not important.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.971
Seems like
a solid jumping-off point,
bro.

06:27.180 --> 06:30.308
Guys, who you think sucks is
not helpful information.

06:30.516 --> 06:34.312
Hey! Hey! Did Chad ever
fight with anyone?

06:34.520 --> 06:37.648
Well, I mean, sometimes
dudes from other frats
would get pissed

06:37.857 --> 06:40.610
- because he crushed
so hard at pong.

06:40.818 --> 06:44.322
He was just a great guy.
He invented Stripper
Car Wash Sunday.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.325
Which sounds degrading,
but all the proceeds
went to charity.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.993
Dude, no, they didn't.

06:49.202 --> 06:51.204
Bro, that's why he didn't have
to pay the strippers.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.289
It all went to, like,
dyslexia research.

06:54.457 --> 06:55.500
The best was Chunk.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.210
Chunk! Ah!

06:57.418 --> 07:00.171
Chad buttered this fat guy's
floor while he was asleep.

07:00.380 --> 07:03.341
So dude gets up in
the morning, all naked, and
he's slipping around like

07:03.549 --> 07:05.760
a freaking walrus on ice.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.845
It's on YouTube.
You guys gotta see it.

07:08.054 --> 07:10.223
- Oh, yeah.
- See, that's just the kind of
guy Chad was, you know.

07:10.431 --> 07:14.060
You pass out drunk,
shave the eyebrows.
Maybe snap a ball-drag pic.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.813
Sounds like he might have
made some people upset.

07:17.021 --> 07:18.731
Maybe the victims
of these pranks?

07:18.940 --> 07:21.651
I guess like a little.
To everyone else it was
just super funny.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.528
Look, Chad wasn't just
pranks and stuff.

07:23.736 --> 07:25.530
Like, he was always there
for his brothers.

07:25.738 --> 07:28.032
When you're doing
your fourth funnel, and
you're not gonna puke,

07:28.241 --> 07:29.325
but you might still give up,

07:31.160 --> 07:36.707
he was the guy yelling,
"Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug!"

07:38.709 --> 07:40.670
- Ready, bro?
- Let's do this, bro!

07:40.878 --> 07:42.213
- Chug! Chug!
- One, two, three.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.677
You ruined my life, man!
You ruined my life.

07:50.388 --> 07:51.347
Chug.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.016
I lost my champion, bro.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.394
I lost my champion.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.733
Hey, you. How did Chad
ruin your life?

08:06.404 --> 08:07.697
Damn!

08:14.120 --> 08:18.374
It was pledge week.
Chad made me streak.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.376
I didn't know I was streaking
by an elementary school

08:20.585 --> 08:22.253
till I heard the kids
start laughing.

08:22.462 --> 08:25.006
Not only was I arrested,

08:25.214 --> 08:27.216
I had to register
as a sex offender.

08:27.425 --> 08:28.926
So why stay with
the fraternity?

08:29.135 --> 08:33.264
Chad convinced me to.
My career prospects are
limited now.

08:33.473 --> 08:36.684
Chad assured me that
the Zeta Beta Thetas
take care of their own.

08:36.893 --> 08:39.437
As long as I'm a brother,
I have a future.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.647
Where were you at the time
of the murder?

08:41.856 --> 08:45.401
I was in the back room,
talking to some girl
in a sexy unicorn costume.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.487
We heard screams
and ran inside.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.571
I'll need the girl's name.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.865
She was just a random chick.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.201
Wait. I saw a photo on
the party's Instagram feed.

08:56.579 --> 08:57.914
Are these
all from the party?

08:58.122 --> 08:59.540
Yeah, look that is me
in the curtain.

08:59.749 --> 09:01.334
How am I supposed
to know that's you?

09:01.542 --> 09:03.503
A pterodactyl could be inside
there and no one would know.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.756
But it's me.
Look, I have the costume.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.634
All that tells me is
you have the costume that
an unidentified person

09:09.842 --> 09:11.802
- was wearing in this photo.
- But it's me.

09:12.011 --> 09:13.554
Okay, Brody will tell you.

09:17.058 --> 09:20.561
You know, these must've
been taken from
the top of the staircase.

09:20.770 --> 09:23.397
All right, there's Chad,
right?

09:23.606 --> 09:28.861
Still there, still there,
still there, gone.
Right? Let's go back.

09:29.070 --> 09:31.113
See this furry blue thing?

09:31.322 --> 09:33.658
You can see Chad as Furry Blue
is heading over,

09:33.866 --> 09:37.245
but look at this one of
Furry Blue walking away.
Chad's down.

09:37.453 --> 09:40.206
- Furry Blue is probably
who stabbed him.
- Okay...

09:40.414 --> 09:42.208
He doesn't remember
what I was wearing, but...

09:42.416 --> 09:44.293
Who wore
the Furry Blue costume?

09:45.878 --> 09:47.588
Yeah, I don't know
who the blue guy is,

09:47.797 --> 09:50.007
- but how huge are
Megan Reilly's cans?

09:50.216 --> 09:52.969
Oh, that's not Megan Reilly,
bro. Her cans are
more teardrop.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.095
Okay!

09:56.389 --> 09:57.431
Thank you for your time.

10:00.935 --> 10:05.398
- So, if I remember anything,
should I call you, or...
- You can call me.

10:05.606 --> 10:10.361
I'm the detective on the case.

10:10.570 --> 10:12.488
You're like that box of
chocolates from <i>Forrest Gump,</i>

10:12.697 --> 10:13.948
I never know
what I'm gonna get.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.117
You're getting chocolate, bro.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.078
I'll start calling
the local costume shops.

10:19.287 --> 10:22.415
See if I can
find the ones that stock that
blue furry costume.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.041
Find out who rented it.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.755
Chakrabarti! Where you at?

10:29.964 --> 10:32.592
I have been doing
some thinking,

10:32.800 --> 10:36.804
and I'm pretty sure
what this morgue needs
is a foosball table.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.940
I know you can't fully
control your actions
when you're on a brain,

10:48.149 --> 10:51.527
but I really need you to try
and rein in the bro.

10:51.736 --> 10:54.530
We would be in serious trouble
if someone came in
and saw how you arranged

10:54.739 --> 10:56.699
the medical skeletons.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.744
And this,
this is unacceptable.

11:01.537 --> 11:03.539
What if someone came in to
identify their loved one

11:03.748 --> 11:06.667
and the medical examiner
had "fart" written
on his forehead?

11:06.876 --> 11:09.378
It isn't funny.

11:09.587 --> 11:11.255
- It's pretty funny.
- It really isn't.

11:11.464 --> 11:13.966
- It kinda is.
- I can assure you
it isn't funny.

11:17.303 --> 11:19.221
It isn't funny.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.557
You're lucky you're receiving
a suspension and
not an expulsion.

11:21.766 --> 11:23.809
Okay.
But it's kind of funny.

11:24.018 --> 11:28.147
No. No, it's not.
It's not funny.

11:28.356 --> 11:33.402
- Were you contemplating your
actions or having a vision?
- If you had to guess...

11:33.611 --> 11:37.239
I take back every bad thing
I ever said about frat boys.

11:37.448 --> 11:39.283
These brains are fun as hell.

11:39.492 --> 11:42.453
I can't stop chillaxing.
Everything is hilarious.

11:42.662 --> 11:46.290
Dude, the guy who killed Chad
is a total dick,
and I demand...

11:46.499 --> 11:47.792
<i>Babineaux.</i>

11:48.000 --> 11:49.835
Wazzup? Just had a vis.

11:50.044 --> 11:53.172
Yeah, it was, like,
a discipline
hearing-type thing.

11:53.381 --> 11:56.425
This kid looked like he wanted
to murder Chad, bro.

11:56.634 --> 11:58.219
We've gotta find
this other student.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.887
Pronto.

12:00.096 --> 12:01.847
Brain fart.
Whole new level.

12:06.102 --> 12:08.312
So I finally found out
the blue bear is a character

12:08.521 --> 12:11.148
from a Swedish kids' show
named <i>Captain Wozzles.</i>

12:11.357 --> 12:13.359
He did look Nordic.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.404
I called every costume shop
here in Seattle.
So far, no one carries it.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.698
I'll move on to shops
in the surrounding area.

12:18.906 --> 12:22.201
But first, I spoke to the dean
of Pacific West University
about your vision.

12:22.410 --> 12:23.994
He wouldn't give me details
about the grievance filed

12:24.203 --> 12:26.205
against Chad
without a warrant,

12:26.414 --> 12:29.125
but said I was welcome to see
if the student was open to
discussing it.

12:29.333 --> 12:32.169
He's on his way in now.
And you'll never guess
what his name is.

12:32.378 --> 12:33.796
Chad Wolcoff.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.715
Like the murder victim.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.675
Can you tell us why
you filed a grievance
against Chad?

12:37.883 --> 12:39.969
Chad and I often got each
other's mail back at school.

12:40.177 --> 12:43.431
I got invited to speak
at a high school about
the dangers of drunk driving.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.307
Chad got my invitation
by mistake.

12:45.516 --> 12:50.187
He thought it would
be a hoot to get wasted
and go in my place.

12:50.396 --> 12:52.648
He basically gave a tutorial
on how to drink and drive

12:52.857 --> 12:56.444
to 200 high school seniors
before school security
dragged him off stage.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.821
Oh, hey,
I get why that's awful,

12:59.029 --> 13:01.574
but I think Chad was just
trying to be funny, you know.
I...

13:01.782 --> 13:05.077
Thirty people per day
are killed in
drunk driving accidents.

13:05.286 --> 13:07.496
Can you tell us
where you were last night,
around 10 p.m.?

13:09.498 --> 13:11.709
Uh...
I was in my room, studying.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.127
Anyone who can verify that?

13:15.755 --> 13:17.840
Doubtful. It's just...

13:18.048 --> 13:21.761
Look, I took the appropriate
actions with Chad, okay?

13:21.969 --> 13:24.013
I met with the dean.
I filed a complaint.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.850
Chad was a buffoon,
but I don't think
he deserved to die.

13:28.058 --> 13:33.022
All right. I'll contact you
with any further questions.
Don't leave town.

13:38.486 --> 13:42.531
Tightly wound,
but he didn't give me
a premeditated murder vibe.

13:42.740 --> 13:45.367
I'm guessing he lost
someone close to him in
a drunk-driving accident.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.703
Chad making light of that
could've made him snap.

13:47.912 --> 13:49.538
A sideways glance could've
made him snap.

13:49.747 --> 13:51.290
That dude has zero chill.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.085
Your blood pressure is
a bit higher than it's been.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.295
It might not be cure-related.

13:56.504 --> 13:57.588
Still feeling okay?

13:58.380 --> 14:00.007
Yeah.

14:00.216 --> 14:03.427
So, I know you're a student
of men's lifestyle magazines.

14:03.636 --> 14:06.388
Beard glitter.
Is this a trend
I should know about?

14:06.597 --> 14:07.807
It was an accident.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.059
Involving a My Little Pony?

14:10.267 --> 14:12.770
I had some makeup on before
that was surprisingly
difficult to wash off.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.064
Been there.
So, you know I'm
referring to your beard

14:15.272 --> 14:17.149
as Princess Sparkles
from now on though, right?

14:17.358 --> 14:18.818
Why would you be
referring to my beard?

14:19.026 --> 14:20.694
"You've got some crumbs
stuck in Princess Sparkles."

14:20.861 --> 14:23.572
Or, "Princess Sparkles
could use a trim."

14:26.617 --> 14:28.452
So, how's work going
on the cure?

14:28.661 --> 14:30.663
I can't make any progress
without tainted Utopium.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.499
I've run tests on regular
Utopium, but, to be honest,

14:33.707 --> 14:35.417
I know very little about
how the drug works.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.837
I mean, it's relatively new,
there aren't studies.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.381
Have you, you know,
ever tried any?

14:40.589 --> 14:42.174
You know hugs are
my drug of choice.

14:42.383 --> 14:44.009
I've been mulling it over,

14:44.218 --> 14:45.886
and I think it would be
beneficial for me to try some.

14:46.095 --> 14:47.471
You know, so I can better
understand its effects.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.223
Isn't that kind of like
smacking a bear

14:49.431 --> 14:51.684
- to better understand
being mauled to death?
- No.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.812
It's like smacking a bear to
better understand physical
exertion and adrenaline.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.189
Field research is
incredibly helpful.

14:57.398 --> 15:01.610
Experiencing how Utopium
works in the body could help
my research immeasurably.

15:01.819 --> 15:03.529
Would you come to
a club with me?

15:03.737 --> 15:05.197
I could use someone
to monitor me while
I'm on the drug.

15:05.406 --> 15:07.074
You know, make sure I'm safe,
help record data.

15:07.283 --> 15:09.034
Ravi, can't I just help you
move a couch or something?

15:09.243 --> 15:12.621
I'm really not up for the,
like, "Watch me do drugs"
favor.

15:12.830 --> 15:15.875
Sorry. I didn't realize there
were limits to our friendship.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.962
Oh, don't bat those
big brown eyes at me,

15:20.170 --> 15:23.674
you manipulative bastard.
All right. I should get going.

15:23.883 --> 15:26.552
- I do not want to
run into Liv...
Too late.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.736
How are you doing?

15:43.944 --> 15:45.321
Hanging in there.

15:45.529 --> 15:49.742
- No, really.
- You know,
let's not do this, okay?

15:49.950 --> 15:52.369
No let's-get-real talk.
Not yet.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.121
I'm great. All's well.

15:54.288 --> 15:55.789
Sorry, bro, just asking.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.667
- Bro?
- I'm on frat boy brains
at the moment,

15:58.876 --> 16:01.170
and everything's getting
filtered through
the bro-zone layer.

16:02.588 --> 16:05.382
"I'm on frat boy brains.
No big whoop."

16:05.591 --> 16:08.260
Just like you're
doing a cleanse.
Eating dead people brains.

16:08.469 --> 16:11.639
It's just a fact of
my life right now.
Look past it, please.

16:11.847 --> 16:13.098
I wanna catch up.

16:13.307 --> 16:15.059
Sorry, bro. No can do.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.579
Ahh.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.124
Bad day?

16:39.333 --> 16:40.709
I got smacked down by someone
I used to be tight with.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.378
It was harsh.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.964
Hey, I'm happy you're
a drink-through-the-pain type.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.758
Not the sad-girl-surrounded-
by-empty-ice-cream-pints
type.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.051
You want in on this?

16:49.259 --> 16:51.053
How about we go get
a real drink?

16:51.261 --> 16:53.597
I kind of felt like
ordering in hot wings
and watching <i>Entourage.</i>

16:57.142 --> 16:59.895
- Yo! Who?
<i>- Brody!</i>

17:00.104 --> 17:02.731
- Brody?
- From Zeta Beta Theta?

17:02.940 --> 17:05.275
I got your deets from
a Jamaican dude
at the morgue.

17:05.484 --> 17:08.237
So, listen, we're hosting
this memorial thing
for Chad tonight.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.531
<i>It's like, a party.</i>

17:10.739 --> 17:14.743
I thought you might wanna
come by, you know.
Just, like, hang or whatever.

17:14.952 --> 17:17.621
You wanna come with me
to a frat party tonight?
It's kind of a work thing.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.166
- Yeah, cool.
<i>- There's a dress code.</i>

17:21.375 --> 17:24.837
Dress code? A dress code
for a frat party?

17:25.045 --> 17:26.672
- Chad...
- I remember this one time,

17:26.880 --> 17:29.758
me and Chad were kayaking
in the San Juans.

17:29.967 --> 17:33.512
He told me,
"If I ever die, bro,

17:33.721 --> 17:35.514
"I don't want it to be lame."

17:35.723 --> 17:38.600
He said that he wanted
his death to be like his life.

17:40.102 --> 17:43.355
An epic party,
where anything goes,

17:44.189 --> 17:45.441
but clothes!

17:49.194 --> 17:50.696
Chad! Chad! Chad! Chad!

18:00.122 --> 18:01.915
Remind me again
how this is for work.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.877
- Oh, it's hard to explain.
I'm trying to be bro-active.
- Oh.

18:05.419 --> 18:06.503
Ladies!

18:06.712 --> 18:08.505
No, I don't do
Mardi Gras beads.

18:08.714 --> 18:11.091
- Well, uh...
- And, yes, I know I'm wearing
a garbage bag.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.385
- Hey, girl!
- Hey!

18:13.594 --> 18:16.388
- Hey, make sure
she gets the red, bro.
- Oh, yeah.

18:16.597 --> 18:19.141
Red is for "date."
It's this "Do, Date, Delete"
game we play.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.310
Actually, I made
a website for it.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.730
So, like, okay...
Do, date, delete, Tom Hardy,
Tom Brady, Tom Cruise.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.732
Do you still get to do
the one you date?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.442
Yeah. But you gotta
keep doing them.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.611
- So you're, like,
locking yourself in.
- Got it.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.362
- Date Hardy.
- Yeah.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.281
Wait, I kind of want to
delete Brady and Cruise.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.699
Makes you think, right?

18:36.825 --> 18:38.744
Yeah!

18:38.952 --> 18:41.705
Yeah, there's no way
I'm drinking something
I didn't pour myself,

18:41.914 --> 18:43.290
and there's no way
I'm not drinking,

18:43.499 --> 18:46.043
so I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

18:49.838 --> 18:53.050
- So, you wanna see my room?
- Maybe later, bro.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.888
<i>Right now, I've got one word
in my bro-cabulary,</i>

18:58.097 --> 19:03.185
<i>and that word is "justice."
I am going on the vision
quest of all vision quests.</i>

19:03.393 --> 19:05.521
<i>I will not rest till I find
the bastard who...</i>

19:07.189 --> 19:10.692
Beer pong! Time to get
your balls wet, bros!

19:22.496 --> 19:24.915
I was wrong about
the bathroom being
the place to score drugs.

19:25.124 --> 19:26.959
There's definitely
some transactions
going on in there,

19:27.167 --> 19:29.545
but not the kind
we're looking for.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.005
- How you holding up?
- Everyone looks like
a drug dealer

19:32.214 --> 19:35.008
in this lighting.
I have to say,
I'm disappointed.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.136
I thought
you'd be better at this.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.972
Because everything about
me says I'd be awesome
at scoring drugs?

19:40.180 --> 19:42.182
You bought a grenade out
of the trunk of a car.

19:42.391 --> 19:44.476
How can you not
figure out how to buy drugs
at a nightclub?

19:44.685 --> 19:46.728
It's a different skill set.
If you want a bazooka,

19:46.937 --> 19:49.773
I can get you a bazooka
in 15 minutes, at cost.

19:49.982 --> 19:52.317
That isn't very helpful
right now, is it?

19:52.526 --> 19:53.986
Looking to score some U?

19:54.194 --> 19:56.738
Maybe. I don't know.

19:56.947 --> 19:58.740
How do I know
you're not a cop?

19:58.949 --> 20:01.785
- How do I know he's not a cop?
- How do you know
I'm not a cop?

20:01.994 --> 20:03.954
I'm strangely offended.

20:04.163 --> 20:05.581
Frankly, I'm fairly certain
I'm the closest to
law enforcement here.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.916
- How much do you want?
- Oh, two, please.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.169
One to take now, and one to
take in a controlled
environment at a later date.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.381
Later, dude.

20:14.548 --> 20:17.843
Okay. So, once one
purchases the drugs,
where does one do them?

20:23.223 --> 20:24.892
Yes!

20:25.100 --> 20:27.311
Are you not entertained?

20:27.519 --> 20:30.647
Your friend is so great.
Is she always like this?

20:31.773 --> 20:32.900
She wasn't yesterday.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.824
I feel amazing.

20:41.033 --> 20:45.495
I'm so present, so in my body,
but I'm also floating,

20:45.704 --> 20:51.251
like watching the experience
be experienced,

20:51.460 --> 20:54.713
like I literally don't have
a care in the world!

20:54.922 --> 20:57.841
I'm just floating on goodness.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.637
When did everything
get so beautiful?

21:13.106 --> 21:15.275
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

21:17.903 --> 21:19.780
Yay!

21:22.616 --> 21:26.495
Hey! I know you're going
for gold in the bro-lympics,

21:26.703 --> 21:29.248
- just wondering how
that's a work thing?
- Right.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.375
My bad. Time to focus.

21:37.089 --> 21:40.425
You got this, bro.
You got this.

22:02.656 --> 22:05.492
Dude, we need to
get more of this.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.035
What?

22:07.244 --> 22:09.413
Utopium. I want more.

22:30.058 --> 22:35.355
"Zeta Beta Theta Dog Fight
2015 Champion
Chad Wolcoff."

22:35.564 --> 22:40.027
- Hey!
You made it upstairs.
- You guys fight dogs?

22:40.235 --> 22:43.739
Huh? Oh, hells no.
No, that's disgusting.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.491
No, the Dog Fight is,
like, this party
where all the frat bros,

22:46.700 --> 22:48.785
they invite the homeliest girl
they can find,

22:48.994 --> 22:51.455
and then the champion is
the one whose date is

22:51.663 --> 22:53.999
the last dog you'd want
to throw a bone.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.209
Oh, no, but it's not,
like, mean or anything.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.919
I mean, the girls know
they're ugly, right?

22:58.128 --> 23:00.672
Who did Chad bring to the
party the night that he won?

23:00.881 --> 23:02.924
Uh... This girl Paulette.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.260
- Why do you want to talk
about ugly girls so much?

23:05.469 --> 23:09.598
Come on, let's go get naked
and cuddle. Just kind of
see what's what.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.850
- Major?
- Hey, I found you under
"In Case of Emergency"

23:12.059 --> 23:13.226
on this guy's phone.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.395
<i>You should probably
come get him.</i>

23:15.604 --> 23:16.980
Where are you?

23:17.189 --> 23:20.192
<i>- Billy Club, downtown.</i>
- Okay, I'm on my way.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.502
I got you, bro. I got you.

24:02.067 --> 24:03.985
217 Emerson Street.

24:04.194 --> 24:07.989
You guys are the best.
And can I just say

24:08.198 --> 24:12.285
just how glad I am that
we're all in the know over
the whole zombie thing.

24:15.163 --> 24:16.498
Not cool, bro.

24:16.706 --> 24:17.958
I am your bro.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.334
Let's go! Move it!

24:19.543 --> 24:20.794
And I'm your bro.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.005
And I'm your bro.

24:24.214 --> 24:26.633
And I'm a bro to
whoever is texting you.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.222
What the hell?

24:32.431 --> 24:35.267
They can hear you.
They're always listening.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.686
Guys, guys...

24:39.020 --> 24:41.148
We should get
matching tattoos.

24:49.156 --> 24:52.659
Am I that messed up,
or are you wearing
police tape?

24:54.578 --> 24:55.871
You're that messed up.

24:58.248 --> 25:02.836
Aspirin. Water. Electrolytes.

25:03.044 --> 25:06.131
And I thought paper towels
were a good idea.

25:06.339 --> 25:09.509
You're not gonna want to,
but you should try
to drink lots of fluids.

25:14.973 --> 25:17.017
I'll leave you to it.
Good luck.

25:19.895 --> 25:21.021
Can you stay?

26:06.942 --> 26:09.402
I won't let anything
happen to you.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.950
And I won't shave
your eyebrows.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.967
So I checked into
that Dog Fight winner,
like you suggested.

26:32.175 --> 26:33.760
Paulette Mosley.
She's on her way in.

26:34.553 --> 26:36.471
Oh, damn.

26:36.680 --> 26:40.684
- What?
- What if she doesn't know
about the Dog Fight?

26:40.892 --> 26:42.394
They probably don't
tell them, right?

26:42.602 --> 26:44.980
If you tell her,
you could destroy
this poor girl.

26:45.188 --> 26:46.606
I have to ask her.
It's motive.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.483
It's why we're
bringing her in.

26:48.692 --> 26:50.569
You're on your own, bro.

26:50.777 --> 26:53.947
Tragedy needs
the "plus time" for funny.
This needs "plus time."

26:54.155 --> 26:56.366
You know it's probably
irrelevant anyway.

26:56.575 --> 26:59.494
Based on the photos from
the frat party, the killer had
to be over six-feet tall.

26:59.703 --> 27:00.954
Are you Babineaux?

27:24.853 --> 27:26.688
I don't think she knew.

27:32.861 --> 27:37.824
<i>11:52 p.m. Heart rate
is... Oh, hey.</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

27:38.033 --> 27:40.201
<i>- I love you!</i>
<i>- You what?
Huh?</i>

27:40.410 --> 27:43.204
<i>- I love you!
- You love me?</i>

27:43.413 --> 27:46.833
<i>That's so amazing.
Uh-huh. I love you.</i>

27:48.877 --> 27:52.547
<i>Bubbles are magical.</i>

27:54.549 --> 27:57.344
<i>♪ I'm lagging, swagging,
high on the wagon
that she dragging</i>

27:57.552 --> 27:59.846
<i>♪ Blow her brain out the back
with the goods I'm packing</i>

28:00.013 --> 28:02.766
<i>♪ Weezy... ♪</i>

28:02.974 --> 28:07.395
<i>Major, you know
what we need for the house?
Velvet.</i>

28:07.604 --> 28:10.857
<i>Major. Major. Major.</i>

28:11.816 --> 28:12.901
<i>Major. Major.</i>

28:13.109 --> 28:15.236
Hey. Hi.

28:15.445 --> 28:18.782
Oh, no, I was... I was
just listening to a thing
a friend sent. A jokey bit.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.910
I hope it was funny 'cause
things are getting ready to
get gruesome.

28:22.118 --> 28:23.578
Prepare yourself.

28:23.787 --> 28:25.330
- It's pretty gnarly.
- Trust me,
I'm more than used to...

28:28.917 --> 28:31.127
You never get used to it.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.254
I'll be right back.
I've got three
more just like this one.

28:41.221 --> 28:44.516
He knocked off all four
dealers. Tortured them.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.310
There's no way that
he'd give me up.
There's no way!

28:47.519 --> 28:49.187
<i>Speedy, take it easy.</i>

28:49.396 --> 28:50.980
- He's coming after me.
<i>- Speedy.</i>

28:51.189 --> 28:52.857
You know he's coming after me.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.318
That's why you have
to lay low, Speedy.
You hear me?

28:55.527 --> 28:57.696
<i>You don't talk to anyone.
I'll handle this.</i>

28:57.904 --> 28:59.406
- Okay.
- You call me anytime.

28:59.614 --> 29:01.908
It's us against them, brother.
I got you.

29:03.326 --> 29:04.994
Is everything okay?

29:07.914 --> 29:09.040
Fine and dandy.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.961
All four victims are
missing teeth and fingernails.

29:13.169 --> 29:15.547
The detective on the case
thinks someone was
sending a message.

29:15.755 --> 29:18.925
And this is the guy who sold
you and Major Utopium
at the club?

29:19.134 --> 29:24.431
I buy drugs one time, purely
for research purposes,
and this is what happens.

29:24.639 --> 29:27.225
How bad must my karma be?

29:27.434 --> 29:29.102
Ever think it was his karma?

29:29.310 --> 29:32.105
Hey, I haven't been able
to reach you.

29:32.313 --> 29:33.773
Oh. Someone ran over my phone.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.445
I found a shop in Tacoma that
carries our elusive costume.

29:38.653 --> 29:41.030
Got a name for the girl
who rented it the night
of the frat party.

29:41.239 --> 29:43.992
Apparently, she rented it
for her boyfriend.
They're on their way in.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.994
Let's go.

29:46.202 --> 29:48.705
Captain Wozzles is awesome.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.915
Um, why do you want to
talk about the costume?

29:51.124 --> 29:52.917
I swear, it wasn't damaged
when we returned it.

29:53.126 --> 29:54.502
Are they saying
that it was damaged?

29:54.711 --> 29:56.880
A student was murdered
at a Pac West frat party.

29:57.088 --> 29:59.799
We have reason to believe
the killer wore
a Captain Wozzles costume.

30:00.008 --> 30:02.635
Wow, I didn't see any blood
on it or anything.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.597
The murder happened
while you were in possession
of the costume.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.140
I haven't been able to
locate another one.

30:07.348 --> 30:09.726
Wait, I don't understand.
You think it was me?

30:09.934 --> 30:13.271
- 'Cause I haven't been to
a frat party ever in my life.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.315
We just moved here from
Spokane a few months ago.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.525
Can you tell us
where you were two
nights ago? Around 10 p.m.?

30:17.734 --> 30:21.362
I was at home with Becky.
We were just
hanging out at home.

30:21.571 --> 30:23.948
He was with me all night.
I swear.

30:24.157 --> 30:26.993
So, you rented the costume,
and then just stayed home
and didn't use it?

30:28.119 --> 30:30.830
No, like...

30:31.039 --> 30:33.625
I used it. I used it.
I just...

30:35.001 --> 30:36.836
I wore it at home.

30:37.045 --> 30:39.422
You just wore
a Captain Wozzles costume
in your living room?

30:39.631 --> 30:43.635
Uh... I'm a furry.

30:43.843 --> 30:46.971
- A what?
- I'm into costumes that look
like stuffed animals.

30:48.848 --> 30:51.351
Like sexually.

30:51.559 --> 30:52.977
It's a fetish, okay?

30:54.229 --> 30:57.023
I was not expecting that.

30:57.232 --> 31:00.610
Here's what I'm going to need.
I'm going to need
details, photos.

31:00.819 --> 31:03.196
We don't need details
or photos.

31:03.404 --> 31:05.490
Unless you have them,
and they're hilarious.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.992
We definitely don't need
details or photos.

31:09.410 --> 31:11.621
Yes, we do.

31:11.830 --> 31:15.834
What would be more shocking,
that sweet-faced kid
as a murderer,

31:16.042 --> 31:18.962
or that kid
getting his freak on
dressed as a stuffed animal?

31:19.170 --> 31:21.005
Sonny doesn't appear to
have any connection to Chad,

31:21.214 --> 31:24.551
or the frat, or even
the college.
Where's the motive?

31:24.759 --> 31:27.720
There has to be
another Captain Wozzles
costume out there.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.640
I haven't been able to locate
another anywhere.

31:30.849 --> 31:33.059
Maybe it was the actual
Captain Wozzles?

31:35.854 --> 31:36.855
Blaine!

31:39.274 --> 31:40.316
Wait.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.570
I wasn't finished.

31:43.778 --> 31:45.655
Okay.
Don't go too far this time.

31:45.864 --> 31:48.074
More milky Tilda Swinton,
less Casper's ass.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.286
- Yeah? Good.
- Yeah.

31:52.161 --> 31:54.330
Sir.

31:54.539 --> 31:56.833
There's a man outside
says he wants to see you.
Doesn't have an appointment.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.335
What do I care, Nina?
Send him away.

31:59.544 --> 32:01.045
Uh, he scares me.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.810
Send him in.
Take an early lunch.

32:19.772 --> 32:24.527
Stacey Boss
controls narcotics,
bookmaking, prostitution,

32:24.736 --> 32:28.323
smuggling, trafficking,
murder for hire,
DVD late fees.

32:28.531 --> 32:31.659
People in Seattle can't get
mugged without him
getting his beak wet.

32:31.868 --> 32:34.996
One in eight cops and
one in three judges
are on his payroll.

32:35.204 --> 32:36.331
I worked for the guy.

32:36.539 --> 32:38.708
Tell me
something I don't know.

32:38.917 --> 32:41.961
That I don't want to die?
Because if you're really
asking me to use the powers

32:42.170 --> 32:43.922
of the DA's office
to bring down Mr. Boss...

32:44.130 --> 32:46.257
First, you're already dead.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.677
Get over it.

32:49.886 --> 32:53.431
Second, once you hold
a press conference declaring
him public enemy number one

32:53.640 --> 32:56.893
and that you, Floyd Baracus,
Eliot Ness-like
paragon of virtue

32:57.101 --> 32:59.979
will be the public servant
who puts him in jail,

33:00.188 --> 33:03.399
you'll be...
What's the word?
Ah, yes.

33:03.608 --> 33:06.986
Untouchable.
Next stop, mayor's office.

33:07.195 --> 33:09.238
No one cares about Mr. Boss
anymore.

33:09.447 --> 33:13.159
He's an institution around
here. He's like the monorail
or salmon tossing.

33:13.368 --> 33:14.661
- We're used to him.
- That was yesterday.

33:14.869 --> 33:16.204
Today's a bit different.

33:16.412 --> 33:17.705
- Don't you read the papers?
- I saw it.

33:17.914 --> 33:19.916
More dead drug dealers.
It won't change things.

33:20.124 --> 33:21.709
Sure about that?

33:21.918 --> 33:23.503
Take a look at these kids.

33:23.670 --> 33:26.881
Attractive. Well-to-do.
Good families.

33:27.090 --> 33:29.717
Nobody cared
when he was killing
the unwashed masses.

33:29.926 --> 33:34.013
But now he's moved to new
territories, where people
register to vote.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.849
Protecting rich white kids
is your job.

33:37.016 --> 33:39.394
You've just been
handed the political will
to take him down.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.562
You know how risky it would be
to take on Mr. Boss?

33:41.771 --> 33:43.481
I bet you wish
you had the choice, huh?

33:45.024 --> 33:46.192
I'll need cash.

33:46.401 --> 33:48.528
You get paid in brains.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.822
I'll have to grease a lot of
palms in order to get any
movement on this case.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.825
One in eight cops.
One in three judges.
Remember?

33:55.034 --> 33:56.536
I'll get you the cash.

33:56.744 --> 33:58.037
Do you have any idea
what you're starting here?

33:59.163 --> 34:00.164
I believe I do.

34:08.548 --> 34:10.967
Wakey-wakey, Speedy.

34:11.175 --> 34:13.845
- No. No. No!
- Mr. Boss sends his regards.

34:21.310 --> 34:25.773
And Alexander wept
when he realized there were
no more worlds to conquer.

34:25.982 --> 34:27.650
Did you weep, Angus?

34:27.859 --> 34:30.486
Let me guess, business
has been so bad

34:30.695 --> 34:32.196
you're reduced to making
your own deliveries.

34:32.405 --> 34:35.742
No. The only brains I brought
today are right up here.

34:35.950 --> 34:37.827
And wouldn't you love
a bite of those bad boys.

34:38.036 --> 34:40.580
No need. I've read <i>Oedipus.</i>

34:40.788 --> 34:45.835
Oedipus requires
a living mother, but, hey.

34:46.044 --> 34:48.129
How could you have seen
the warning signs?

34:48.337 --> 34:51.841
Don't all wives lock
themselves alone in their room
for weeks at a time,

34:52.050 --> 34:54.052
claiming they want to die?

34:54.260 --> 34:56.846
And why would it even occur to
you to lock up your Beretta?

34:57.055 --> 34:59.390
You're a whiny bitch.

34:59.599 --> 35:01.476
So obvious that you
didn't get that from me.

35:01.684 --> 35:05.980
What was it Madonna said?
"Papa, don't preach."

35:06.189 --> 35:10.193
And business is booming,
thank you for asking.
My client list keeps growing,

35:10.401 --> 35:13.529
but don't worry.
You never forget
your first customer.

35:13.738 --> 35:16.616
Son turns father
into a member
of the undead.

35:16.824 --> 35:22.121
Gee. Why did Oedipus
even cross my mind?
What is it you want?

35:22.330 --> 35:26.876
What does anyone ever want
from you, Angus? Money.

35:27.085 --> 35:29.212
Lots of it.

35:29.420 --> 35:32.381
On top of the 25k
a month for brains? Whoo!

35:32.590 --> 35:34.926
You should learn to
live within your means.

35:35.134 --> 35:39.806
If you don't mind,
what shortcut are you
taking this time, huh?

35:40.014 --> 35:45.061
It's always the same for you,
isn't it? Always looking for
the easy way out.

35:45.269 --> 35:49.023
Least amount of
talent required.

35:50.608 --> 35:53.319
Least amount of effort.

35:53.528 --> 35:57.115
What does the PowerPoint look
like for your inspirational
climb up the ladder?

35:57.323 --> 36:01.285
Step one. Have your father
who built the company
institutionalized.

36:01.494 --> 36:03.955
Step two. Move
into his office.

36:04.163 --> 36:06.916
Your Horatio Alger story
was a phone call.

36:11.754 --> 36:17.343
The strings I pulled to
get my party boy son
into Wharton.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.222
You couldn't make it
one semester.

36:23.349 --> 36:27.520
"Dad. Dad, Dad,
Dad, Dad, Dad...

36:27.728 --> 36:31.315
"This widget's gonna
revolutionize the way
we listen to music,

36:31.524 --> 36:33.943
"rent apartments, hook up.

36:34.152 --> 36:37.446
"I just need some
startup capital."

36:37.655 --> 36:40.449
I always knew
the request was coming,
because you'd manage

36:40.658 --> 36:46.038
to hide your hate for me
for a few weeks
leading up to the pitch.

36:46.247 --> 36:51.002
And I would just give in.
I guess that's
how this story ends.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.546
No.

36:53.754 --> 36:58.593
This story ends with me taking
this chair, this desk, this
office, your entire company.

36:58.801 --> 37:01.512
The only thing that means
anything to you.

37:01.721 --> 37:06.309
I'll watch you walk out of
here with a cardboard box
full of paperclips and K-Cups.

37:06.517 --> 37:09.270
It's the dream that gets me
out of bed each day.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.647
And after I watch
that play out,

37:11.856 --> 37:14.775
I'm gonna stick you
in the same hellhole
where you stuck Grandpa.

37:16.194 --> 37:19.071
- He babied you.
- He loved me.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.823
You just don't know
the difference.

37:28.956 --> 37:30.791
Make it out for
half a million.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.835
Look at me.

37:33.044 --> 37:35.671
Chip off the old block.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.882
Katy Perry.
Kate Upton.
Kate Middleton.

37:38.090 --> 37:41.427
I mean, all three
doable and datable.
This game is impossible.

37:43.471 --> 37:45.473
By the time I got the Captain
Wozzles costume from the shop,

37:45.681 --> 37:47.266
it had already been laundered.

37:47.475 --> 37:48.851
I was hoping Forensics could
still get something off of it.

37:49.060 --> 37:50.186
I'm kind of glad
they couldn't,

37:50.394 --> 37:52.521
after what our furry
friends told us.

37:54.315 --> 37:57.860
Hmm... Do
Dylan McDermott.
Date Bob Dylan.

37:58.069 --> 37:59.487
Delete Dermot Mulroney.

37:59.695 --> 38:01.405
Really? Did you not see
his turn on <i>New Girl?</i>

38:01.614 --> 38:03.449
- I found him delightful.
- Oh, I thought
Dylan McDermott was

38:03.658 --> 38:05.451
from <i>My Best Friend's Wedding.</i>

38:05.618 --> 38:08.246
- Mmm-mmm, that's
Dermot Mulroney.
- I deleted the wrong Dermot!

38:09.455 --> 38:11.624
Wait a minute.

38:11.832 --> 38:14.877
- What if...
- What if the wrong guy
got killed?

38:15.086 --> 38:18.464
I couldn't find a connection
to you and the murder victim

38:18.673 --> 38:20.132
because there wasn't one.

38:20.341 --> 38:22.593
But I've got some bad news
for you, son.

38:22.802 --> 38:24.804
This Chad Wolcoff,
the one you killed,

38:25.012 --> 38:27.640
he's not who ran over
your father in
a drunk-driving accident.

38:27.848 --> 38:28.808
No, that would be

38:30.059 --> 38:32.019
this Chad Wolcoff,

38:32.228 --> 38:33.896
from your hometown of Spokane.

38:34.105 --> 38:35.690
You murdered an innocent man.

38:35.898 --> 38:39.193
Chad Wolcoff of Spokane,
the one you believed
you were killing,

38:39.402 --> 38:41.404
has spent the past five years
speaking at high schools

38:41.612 --> 38:43.406
about the dangers
of drunk driving.

38:43.614 --> 38:45.491
He was trying to make amends
for what he did
to your family.

38:58.087 --> 39:03.968
My dad was working
up on Highway 2,
putting in a guardrail.

39:04.176 --> 39:10.057
This drunk 15-year-old kid
doing 95 skids right into him.

39:12.560 --> 39:16.480
All I knew about the guy
who killed Dad was he was
a few years older than me

39:19.108 --> 39:21.861
and his name was Chad Wolcoff.

39:22.069 --> 39:25.448
Every once in a while,
I would google
this Chad Wolcoff.

39:25.656 --> 39:28.701
Until I finally
got a hit last year.
He was the right age.

39:29.910 --> 39:30.953
I had to see him,

39:32.580 --> 39:35.624
the guy who destroyed
my family.

39:35.833 --> 39:38.586
And when I did,
he was just this idiot drunk,

39:38.794 --> 39:40.421
and he didn't care
that he killed my dad.

39:43.132 --> 39:45.217
He didn't have
a care in the world.

39:45.426 --> 39:51.891
And now you're saying that
this wasn't him?

39:52.099 --> 39:55.269
That this is just some guy?
And he didn't do anything?

39:56.437 --> 39:57.438
He didn't do anything?

39:59.190 --> 40:00.232
He didn't do anything.

40:01.150 --> 40:03.486
Oh, no.

40:07.114 --> 40:10.326
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:10.534 --> 40:14.246
Anything you say can
and will be used against
you in a court of law.

40:14.455 --> 40:17.291
<i>Our lives are
a collection of choices.</i>

40:17.500 --> 40:19.960
<i>Sonny chose to
avenge his father.</i>

40:20.169 --> 40:23.506
<i>I chose to not tell my
fiance I'm a zombie.</i>

40:23.714 --> 40:25.841
<i>We make our own beds.</i>

40:26.050 --> 40:28.427
<i>Seems beneath our dignity
to whine when we're
forced to sleep in them.</i>

40:30.554 --> 40:32.348
<i>But Major held me...
Held me and told me</i>

40:32.556 --> 40:35.559
<i>he wouldn't let anything
happen to me.</i>

40:35.768 --> 40:38.979
<i>Maybe,
just this once,
there's a do-over.</i>

40:40.564 --> 40:42.650
- Hey.
- Major left a message.

40:42.858 --> 40:45.277
He wanted me to come
pick up the replacement
cell phone he bought for me.

40:45.486 --> 40:47.738
The phone. Yeah.
Of course. Here.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.743
Oh. I thought he'd be home.

40:52.952 --> 40:54.537
Oh, no, he is.
He is. He's...

40:54.745 --> 40:57.915
It's fine.
I just want to go say "Hi."

40:58.124 --> 41:00.709
We're back on speaking terms.
Baby steps, I know.

41:08.634 --> 41:09.677
Major? It's me.

41:11.429 --> 41:12.680
I left the phone with Ravi.

41:13.764 --> 41:15.182
I just wanted to say "Hi."

41:16.892 --> 41:18.102
Kinda busy.
