02:28.816 --> 02:31.051
THE FOUNDATION
FOR WHOM I WORK

02:31.084 --> 02:34.121
SUPPORTS A BOTANIST
NAMED ROBERT CAMPBELL,

02:34.154 --> 02:36.324
ONCE OF SOME NOTE.

02:36.357 --> 02:39.993
BUT ON SEPARATING FROM HIS WIFE
AND LONGTIME RESEARCH PARTNER,

02:40.027 --> 02:43.331
HE'D WITHDRAWN HIS STATION
DEEPER INTO THE BUSH.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.666
AND UNTIL LAST MONTH'S MESSAGE,

02:45.699 --> 02:48.402
NO ONE HAD HEARD
FROM HIM IN THREE YEARS.

02:48.436 --> 02:52.072
HE ASKED FOR AN ASSISTANT
AND A GAS CHROMATOGRAPH,

02:52.105 --> 02:56.344
AND POINTEDLY REFUSED
TO SAY WHY.

02:56.377 --> 03:00.180
I'M SURPRISED
THAT THEY SENT A WOMAN...

03:00.214 --> 03:03.417
FOR DR. CAMPBELL.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.486
PLEASE DON'T LOSE IT.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.187
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.689
AREN'T YOU COMING WITH ME?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.724
I'M AFRAID
HE WAS ADAMANT ABOUT THAT.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.660

FROM HERE.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.225

WHO AM I?
WHO ARE YOU?

07:23.143 --> 07:25.278
I ASKED YOU FIRST.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.980
YOU'RE DR. CAMPBELL, RIGHT?

07:27.014 --> 07:28.582
I KNOW WHO THE HELL I AM.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.584
I'M ASKING WHO YOU ARE.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.152
CRANE.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.787
NO, NO, TOUCAN.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.789
NO, THAT'S MY NAME.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.626

HOW ODD.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.128
CRANE.
DR. RAE CRANE.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.364
I DO WISH
YOU'D MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.133
NOW WHERE DID YOU GO?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.636
MAYBE IT'S BEST WE TALK
IN THE MORNING, DOCTOR.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.271
THIS IS FROM ORNEGA.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.374
HOW ABOUT A PLACE TO SLEEP?

07:54.407 --> 07:58.111
ORNEGA?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.814
YOU FROM ASTON?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.616
THEY SENT YOU?

08:02.650 --> 08:05.285
I TELL YOU THEY SEND A GIRL.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.687
THEY SENT A GIRL?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.455
YES.
[chuckles]

08:08.488 --> 08:09.790
I'M NOT A GIRL!

08:09.823 --> 08:11.124
THE HELL YOU'RE NOT.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.626
I'M YOUR RESEARCH ASSISTANT.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.628
THE HELL YOU ARE.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.129
AND WHERE'S YOUR MASK?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.031
I DON'T HAVE A MASK.
I JUST GOT HERE.

08:18.065 --> 08:21.234
NO ONE COMES IN HERE
WITHOUT A SURGICAL MASK.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.004
GOD KNOWS WHAT BUGS
YOU'RE CARRYING.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.205
JAHAUSA, GET HER A MASK.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.339
HEY, RELAX.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.741
THIS IS AS CLOSE
AS WE GET, TONTO.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.342
NOT FOR ME, YOU HUSSY!

08:36.183 --> 08:37.751
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHOTS?

08:37.784 --> 08:40.352
WHAT ABOUT A PLACE
TO SLEEP, GOD DAMN IT?

08:40.386 --> 08:42.489
TO SLEEP?!
SLEEP!

08:42.522 --> 08:44.592
OH.

08:44.625 --> 08:48.261
UM, SLEEP...WELL...

08:48.295 --> 08:52.065
YES, OF COURSE.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU
TO LEAVE TILL TOMORROW.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.369

08:56.403 --> 08:58.405
I MUST TELL YOU
HOW GRATEFUL I AM.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.273
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THESE.

09:00.307 --> 09:04.444
THEY GET LOST IN THE FOREST,
YOU SEE?

09:04.477 --> 09:08.015
THE FOREST IS SO VAST AND--

09:08.048 --> 09:10.083
AND WE'RE JUST SO VERY SMALL.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.452

10:57.224 --> 10:59.192
AH, NO, NO, NO, PALALA.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.161
BACK TO THE BOAT.
BACK, BACK.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.063
HEY!

11:03.096 --> 11:05.065
BACK IT UP.
BACK IT UP.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.400
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO UNPACK THAT EQUIPMENT.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.202
WHERE YOU GOING?
NO, NO, NO.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.071
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S LOADING THE BOAT.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.305
NO, NO BOAT.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.741
PALALA, ONLY
THOSE BOXES ARE STAYING.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.342
NO, NO, COME ON.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.011
COME ON.
UP, UP.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.247
UP, DOWN.
LUGGAGE DOWN.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.414
COME ON, PUT IT DOWN.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.016
HEY, WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR

11:23.050 --> 11:27.054
AND ASK HIM
TO PUT MY LUGGAGE DOWN?

11:27.087 --> 11:29.089
[speaks foreign language]

11:30.390 --> 11:32.092
SORRY.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.995
I FORGOT WOMEN LIKE
TO CARRY THEIR OWN NOW.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.430
I THINK I SHOULD
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.432
WELL, YOU'RE THE SO-CALLED
RESEARCH ASSISTANT

11:39.466 --> 11:41.268
FROM ASTON, HMM?

11:41.301 --> 11:43.436
HUH, YOU REMEMBER LAST NIGHT?

11:43.470 --> 11:46.173
DO I APPEAR SENILE?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.440
DRUNK.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.276
INTOXICATED, YES.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.444
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.614
THE PEACH PALM FESTIVAL
IS THE RELIGIOUS CEREMONY.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.284
ARE THOSE BAGS TOO HEAVY?

11:57.317 --> 11:58.451
SHALL I CALL PALALA BACK?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.087
NO.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.421
I'M NOT GETTING ON A BOAT.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.456
NO BOAT.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.558
I'M AFRAID IT'S
THE ONLY AVAILABLE TRANSPORT,

12:05.592 --> 12:07.527
AND YOU CERTAINLY
CAN'T REMAIN HERE.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.797
WHY, BECAUSE I'M NOT A MAN?

12:09.830 --> 12:12.766
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT ONE OF THREE MEN.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.434
I REQUESTED DR. ALAN SEALOVE,

12:14.467 --> 12:17.070
AND IF HE WAS UNAVAILABLE,
DR. GREGORY HOFFMAN.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.438
[scoffs]

12:18.471 --> 12:21.775
I'M PUBLISHED MORE EXTENSIVELY
THAN DR. SEALOVE.

12:21.809 --> 12:26.446
I HOLD DEGREES FROM CCNY,
BERKELEY, AND CAMBRIDGE.

12:26.479 --> 12:30.483
I'M THE RECIPIENT
OF THE THURMAN AWARD...

12:30.517 --> 12:32.452
IN '82 AND '86.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.454
THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME
IT'S EVER BEEN GIVEN

12:34.487 --> 12:36.489
TO THE SAME PERSON TWICE.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.626
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT ME?

12:39.659 --> 12:41.561
DO THOSE BOOTS COME
WITH A MANUAL?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.297
NO.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.434
I THOUGHT OF SNAKES.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.470
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU DID FIELD RESEARCH?

12:50.503 --> 12:52.539
OR WHEN'S THE FIRST TIME?

12:55.342 --> 12:58.178
I DID A MONTH IN LA SALVE.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.313
A WHOLE MONTH?

13:00.347 --> 13:02.015
PALALA?

13:02.049 --> 13:04.651
[speaks foreign language]

13:13.560 --> 13:16.296
YOU DIDN'T NEED ME.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.431
YOU NEEDED A CADDY.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.367
PALALA WILL CADDY YOUR BAGS
TO THE BOAT.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.204
HUH, YOU SEND ME BACK
ON THE BASIS OF MY GENDER.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.306
IT'S CALLED SEX DISCRIMINATION.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.309
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR RESERVATIONS.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.377
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.644
MY WIFE?

13:31.678 --> 13:33.480
[scoffs]
GOOD GOD.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.115
SHE LEFT ME.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.349
I WISH YOU'D
FOLLOW HER EXAMPLE.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.617
ARE WE FINISHED?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.286
YOU HAVE A BOAT TO CATCH.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.354
NO BOAT!

13:41.388 --> 13:43.356
I WANT A MEAL AND A BATH!

13:43.390 --> 13:45.125
THIS ISN'T A HOTEL.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.493
I'LL LEAVE
WHEN I'M DAMN WELL READY.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.361
I KNOW.
AFTER A MEAL AND A BATH.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.563
I'M NOT A 19-YEAR-OLD
GRAD STUDENT

13:50.597 --> 13:53.333
WORKING UP A RESUME,
AND I DON'T EXPECT

13:53.366 --> 13:57.370
TO BE TREATED
AS IF I WERE.

13:57.404 --> 14:00.507
I'M HUNGRY, I'M TIRED...

14:00.540 --> 14:05.312
AND I'VE BEEN IN THESE CLOTHES
FOR MORE THAN ONE DANCE.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.681
PALALA WILL SEE
THAT YOU GET SOME BREAKFAST.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.218
I SAID, "AND A BATH."

14:14.521 --> 14:16.356
UNBUTTON YOUR SHIRT.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.258
EXCUSE ME?

14:18.291 --> 14:21.094
YOU WANT TO BATHE
IN THEIR WATER SUPPLY,

14:21.128 --> 14:23.363
YOU'LL TAKE A MEDICAL FIRST.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.398
SIT DOWN, HERE.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.636
[sighs]

14:33.140 --> 14:34.674
IS HE GONNA WATCH?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.443
DON'T YOU WANT
A NURSE PRESENT?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.111
I'LL RISK IT.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.212
WELL, I WON'T.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.447
AH!

14:40.480 --> 14:42.249
DEEP BREATH.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.185
NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'VE BEEN SO SECRETIVE

14:45.218 --> 14:46.353
ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH HERE.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.687
AGAIN.

14:47.720 --> 14:53.360
YOU'VE FOUND THE CURE
FOR THE COMMON HANGOVER.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.395
AH!

14:58.665 --> 15:00.467
LOOK UP.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.702
LEFT...RIGHT.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.737
[sighs]

15:06.273 --> 15:07.374
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.376
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH ME.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.311
SAY, "AHH."
AHH!

15:14.147 --> 15:15.382
SEE YOUR CONNECTOR.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.284
MY WHAT?

15:17.317 --> 15:18.451
IT'S IN YOUR PASSPORT.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.220
YOUR VACCINE CARD.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.388
OH, GOD.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.757
THIS IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.427
THE PRINCIPLE CAUSE
OF DEATH AMONG ABORIGINALS

15:27.460 --> 15:29.462
IS IMPORTED DISEASE.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.303
[electronic beeping]

15:36.336 --> 15:39.472
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

15:39.506 --> 15:41.474
I THOUGHT WE DID
THE EYE EXAMINATION.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.743
COME ON.
YOU WON TWO THURMAN AWARDS.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.179
SHOW OFF.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.615
WHAT AM I ANALYZING?

15:48.648 --> 15:52.585
DID YOU RUN A BASELINE?

15:52.619 --> 15:55.322
NO.

15:55.355 --> 15:59.292
NEXT TIME, RUN A BASELINE
TO CALIBRATE THE MACHINE.

15:59.326 --> 16:02.295
THERE'S A GLUCOSE SOLUTION
SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.631
IS THAT THE SUBSTANCE
YOU'RE ANALYZING?

16:04.664 --> 16:06.666
YES.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.337
[computer beeps]

16:10.370 --> 16:12.605
WHAT IS IT,
A PLANT EXTRACT?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.341
AH, FULL MARKS.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.476
CONTINUE.

16:16.509 --> 16:20.213
OKAY.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.348
[computer beeps]

16:21.381 --> 16:24.317
WE'RE LOOKING AT, UH...

16:24.351 --> 16:25.785
49 COMPOUNDS.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.987
[rain begins to fall,
thunder rumbles]

16:35.828 --> 16:39.799
OKAY, WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS--

16:39.832 --> 16:42.469
WHERE WAS I?
OKAY, 49 COMPOUNDS.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.572
NO, NO, NOPE.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.641
NEARLY ALL OF THESE
ARE IDENTIFIABLE.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.677
IN SHORT, NOTHING NEW.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.647
IS THIS WHY YOU WANTED
THE CHROMATOGRAPH?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.717
YOU SAID,
"NEARLY ALL IDENTIFIABLE."

16:57.750 --> 16:58.751
YEAH.

16:58.785 --> 17:04.357
JUST THIS ONE, UH, PEAK 37.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.759
LOOKS LIKE AN ACID DERIVATIVE.

17:06.792 --> 17:10.329
ALTHOUGH THOSE SIDE--

17:10.363 --> 17:13.433
YOU MUST HAVE REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE ONTO SOMETHING.

17:13.465 --> 17:14.501
I'M SORRY.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.404
CAN IT BE SYNTHESIZED?

17:17.436 --> 17:18.704
UH-UH.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.739
THIS ONE'S
MOTHER NATURE'S KITCHEN.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.541
END OF STORY.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.077
WHY?

17:24.111 --> 17:25.412
WHAT IS IT YOU THINK
YOU'VE GOT?

17:25.444 --> 17:28.748
I DON'T THINK.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.284
I KNOW.
SHARE IT.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.719
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

17:32.752 --> 17:35.388
EVEN AS A CHILD,
HE DIDN'T LIKE TO SHARE.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.056
IT'S DEEP-SEATED, I SUPPOSE.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.591
WHAT IS IT, A SECRET?

17:38.625 --> 17:41.361
I'LL CROSS MY HEART
AND SPIT ON THE FLOOR.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.397
YOU SAID BREAKFAST
AND A BATH, HUH?

17:44.431 --> 17:46.599
PALALA?
[speaking foreign language]

17:46.633 --> 17:49.269
HEY, YOU SAVING IT
FOR SEALOVE?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.471
DON'T.
HE'S NOT COMING.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.412
THEN I'LL SETTLE
FOR ROBINSON.

17:59.446 --> 18:03.082
YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GOT ME
AND LAST YEAR'S CHROMATOGRAPH.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.621
I GIVE UP.

18:08.655 --> 18:13.092
I BELIEVE OUR DEAL WAS BATH,
BREAKFAST, AND BOAT.

18:13.126 --> 18:16.629
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO MAKE DEALS!

18:16.663 --> 18:19.332
THEN WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

18:19.366 --> 18:22.001
I'LL LEAVE THE CHROMATOGRAPH
FOR THE TIME BEING.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.336
I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION.

18:23.370 --> 18:26.105
YOU HAVE NO IDEA, HAVE YOU?

18:26.139 --> 18:28.608
ASTON'S CONSIDERING
PULLING YOUR FUNDS

18:28.641 --> 18:30.443
AND SHIPPING YOU OUT.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.412
I'M YOUR JUDGE AND JURY.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.980
WINSLOW WOULD NEVER
PERMIT THAT.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.982
AH, WINSLOW!

18:36.015 --> 18:40.587
WINSLOW RETIRED LAST YEAR.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.323
IF YOU HADN'T CUT OFF INCOMING,
YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.458
WHO REPLACED HIM?

18:45.492 --> 18:48.761
ME.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.531
YOU DON'T GIVE PROGRESS REPORTS!

18:51.564 --> 18:53.766
YOU MOVE YOUR DAMN
STATION WHEREVER

18:53.800 --> 18:56.102
AND WHENEVER YOU LIKE!

18:56.135 --> 18:59.005
YOU KNOW, WE NEED
A RECORD OF EXPENSES!

18:59.038 --> 19:02.342
OH, AND YOU DON'T RESPOND

19:02.375 --> 19:07.046

19:07.079 --> 19:09.015
SO HERE I AM!

19:10.817 --> 19:13.152
SO HERE I AM!

19:13.186 --> 19:16.356

19:28.201 --> 19:30.503
PUT THIS ON.
I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.138
I'VE SEEN IT.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.740
PUT IT ON!

19:33.773 --> 19:36.008
PLEASE.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.547
FOLLOW ME.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.991
[speaking native language]

19:52.024 --> 19:54.060
THIS IS KALANA...

19:54.093 --> 19:57.630
WIFE OF JAHAUSA,
MOTHER OF IMANA.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.105
[speaking foreign language]

20:06.138 --> 20:07.640
[speaking foreign language]

20:14.481 --> 20:16.483
PALPATE HER THROAT.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.586
I'M NOT A MEDIC.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.454
GOOD GOD, WOMAN.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.357
MUST EVERYTHING BE A FULL-SCALE
DEBATE WITH YOU?

20:24.391 --> 20:27.093
JUST DO IT.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.102
FEEL ANYTHING?

20:36.135 --> 20:37.570
NOTHING.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.706
AH, SIX MONTHS AGO
SHE CAME TO SEE ME.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.441
COUPLE OF LUMPS IN HER THROAT.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.711
I SENT HER DOWNRIVER
WITH A FRANCISCAN MISSIONARY

20:44.744 --> 20:47.980
TO THE HOSPITAL THERE,
AND SHE MADE HER OWN WAY BACK.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.616
TOOK HER A MONTH.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.751
AND THE NODES WERE
ALMOST DOUBLE THE SIZE.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.754
DEPSWA.

20:54.787 --> 20:58.458
TWO INJECTIONS
OF THAT SAMPLE YOU JUST TESTED,

20:58.491 --> 21:01.594
AND THE LUMPS DISAPPEARED
WITHIN A WEEK.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.464
NO BOOSTERS.
NO SIDE EFFECTS.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.233
THAT'S JUST SWELL.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.236
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO REPORT
TO THE FOUNDATION?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.739
DR. CAMPBELL
SHOWED ME A CURED PATIENT

21:12.772 --> 21:16.008
WHO CLAIMS A HISTORY
OF UNDIAGNOSED,

21:16.042 --> 21:18.177
UNDOCUMENTED LUMPS
IN HER THROAT?

21:18.210 --> 21:20.079
HEY!
OW!

21:20.112 --> 21:22.014
LOOK, I'M TIRED--

21:22.048 --> 21:24.116
HERE IT IS.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.652
A SCAN REPORT.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.454
SHE BROUGHT IT BACK
FROM MANICOBE.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.522
THAT'S DELIGHTFUL.

21:29.556 --> 21:32.191
I'LL BRING IT WITH ME IF YOU'LL
CONTACT DR. ORNEGA--

21:32.224 --> 21:35.662
"STAGE TWO: ANTERIOR
AND POSTERIOR LYMPHOMAS."

21:35.695 --> 21:37.196
[grunts]
HERE.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.165
CHECK HER BIOPSY REPORT.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.467
WHAT FOR?

21:40.500 --> 21:43.135
IT COULD BE ANYBODY'S.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.637
OKAY.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.473
YOU THINK I'M LYING?

21:46.506 --> 21:48.007
I THINK YOU'RE
A MAN WHO'S ALLOWED

21:48.040 --> 21:49.642
HIS PERSONAL PROBLEMS
GET IN THE WAY

21:49.676 --> 21:51.444
OF HIS CLINICAL JUDGMENT.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.813
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.549
STAY.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.117
STAY?

21:58.150 --> 22:00.186
STAY?
HE TALKS TO ME LIKE A DOG.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.522
500,000 SCIENTISTS
IN THIS WORLD,

22:02.555 --> 22:05.191
AND I END UP WITH DR. MENGELE
WITH A PONYTAIL.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.795
NOW WHAT?!

22:08.828 --> 22:10.997
GOOD GOD.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.473
FEEL THAT?

22:20.507 --> 22:22.008
WHAT IS IT?

22:22.041 --> 22:24.677
A SUPRACLAVICULAR NODE.
MALIGNANT.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.078
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

22:26.112 --> 22:27.647
I GAVE IT TO HIM.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.215
TRANSPLANTED TISSUE.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.683
I GAVE IT TO THEM ALL.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.752
YOU WILL BIOPSY THE LOT.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.487
I INSIST.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.656
THAT IS YOUR CONTROL GROUP.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.091
AND THIS LUCKY BUGGER
GETS AN INJECTION

22:39.125 --> 22:42.061
BY NIGHTFALL AND TOMORROW,
IN THE MORNING,

22:42.094 --> 22:43.530
YOU WILL EXAMINE HIM.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.166
OH, COME ON!

22:47.199 --> 22:48.735
I'M NOT PROPOSING MARRIAGE.

22:48.768 --> 22:52.038
I'M ASKING YOU TO BIOPSY
A FAMILY OF RODENTS.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.741
SPEND 12 HOURS IN A PERFECTLY
LUXURIOUS HAMMOCK.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.509
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

22:56.543 --> 22:57.710
JUST NOD.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.320
[guinea pigs squeal]

23:27.640 --> 23:30.643
[children speaking
native language]

24:28.635 --> 24:30.603
WHERE'S THE BALL?

24:30.637 --> 24:31.771

24:31.804 --> 24:33.339
NO BALL.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.208
WHAT WAS IN THE TIN?

25:42.241 --> 25:44.076
HMM?

25:44.110 --> 25:45.745
THE BOYS,
YOU WERE GIVING THEM

25:45.778 --> 25:47.346
SOMETHING FROM THE TIN.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.181
AH, CANDY-COATED ANTS.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.416
OH.

25:50.449 --> 25:52.084
YOU WANT SOME?

25:52.118 --> 25:54.420
THE TIN IS INSIDE
ON THE TABLE.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.422
I'LL PASS.

25:56.455 --> 25:58.390
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

25:58.424 --> 26:00.092
WHAT IS IT?

26:00.126 --> 26:02.094
FREEZE-DRIED ICE CREAM.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.129
I'LL PASS.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.230
COME ON.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.265
THE ASTRONAUTS EAT IT.

26:13.472 --> 26:16.075
DOESN'T TASTE LIKE ICE CREAM.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.443
[scoffs]

26:17.476 --> 26:20.312
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD A DOUBLE DIP?

26:20.346 --> 26:23.249
THE PALATE REMEMBERS.

26:23.282 --> 26:26.318
THAT WOMAN, KALANA?

26:26.352 --> 26:28.454
SHE CALLED YOU SOMETHING.

26:28.487 --> 26:30.322
"DEPSWA."

26:30.356 --> 26:32.759
"DEPSWA"?

26:32.792 --> 26:36.228
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

26:36.262 --> 26:38.097
"MEDICINE MAN."

26:38.130 --> 26:40.332
THAT'S ME.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.134
DON'T THEY HAVE ONE
OF THEIR OWN?

26:42.168 --> 26:44.103
WHAT?

26:44.136 --> 26:48.007
MEDICINE MAN.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.410
I GAVE ALKA-SELTZER
TO A KID WITH A BELLY ACHE.

26:51.443 --> 26:55.114
YOU DID WHAT?

26:55.147 --> 26:57.750
ALKA-SELTZER CURED
HIM WITH ONE BELCH.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.086
BUT IT WAS THE,
"PLOP, PLOP, FIZZ, FIZZ,"

27:00.119 --> 27:01.453
THAT REALLY DAZZLED THEM.

27:01.487 --> 27:05.124
THE MEDICINE MAN WAS
UNDERSTANDABLY PISSED OFF.

27:05.157 --> 27:08.160
I HAD TAKEN HIS STICK.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.296
STICK?

27:10.329 --> 27:12.464
HIS SELF-RESPECT.

27:12.498 --> 27:14.366
HIS PLACE.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.336
SO HE JUST TOOK OFF.

27:17.369 --> 27:22.141
MY INTENTIONS WERE WELL MEANT,

27:22.174 --> 27:24.543
BUT...

27:24.576 --> 27:27.113
YOU TAKE THE HAMMOCK.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.515
I'LL SLEEP IN THE GREENHOUSE.

27:29.548 --> 27:33.119
WELL, IF I NEED ANYTHING,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.722

I'M FROM THE BRONX.

28:01.547 --> 28:05.251
OH, WELL, THE BRONX.

28:05.284 --> 28:09.555

29:05.644 --> 29:08.314
YOU'RE STARING AT ME.

29:08.347 --> 29:11.217

OH, I UNDERSTAND.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.518
A GIRL HAS TO DRAW

COME ON, OLD DEAR.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.458
SWEET DREAMS.

29:52.491 --> 29:55.294
GO TO HELL.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.496
PROBABLY.

30:12.244 --> 30:15.081
NO, DO YOU?

30:22.088 --> 30:23.522
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

30:26.558 --> 30:29.561

YOU KNOW?

31:16.608 --> 31:19.245
YOU KNOW.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.113
YOU'VE FOUND
THE CURE FOR CANCER

31:21.147 --> 31:25.584
AND ALL YOU CAN SAY IS,
"I KNOW"?

31:38.730 --> 31:40.566
WHAT IS IT?

31:40.599 --> 31:42.201
BROMELIAD.

GET DRESSED.

31:49.608 --> 31:52.478
OKAY.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.483
I CAME HERE SIX YEARS AGO.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.218
WHY?

A FREAK TRIBE.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.121
NO CANCER.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.256
WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN

32:04.290 --> 32:07.459
NO, JAHAUSA MARRIED
OUTSIDE THE TRIBE.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.661
KALANA'S AN EXOTI.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.463
THEN IT'S GENETIC.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.232
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S ENVIRONMENTAL.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.568
THE TRIBES HAVE ALWAYS
INTERMARRIED.

32:16.602 --> 32:20.606
BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THE BROMELIAD

32:20.639 --> 32:23.442
DOESN'T GROW ANYWHERE
EXCEPT HERE.

32:23.475 --> 32:26.645
SO THE EXOTI DON'T USE IT.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.281
KALANA STILL DOESN'T
PUT IT IN THEIR FOOD.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.450
SHE SAYS IT TASTES BAD.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.752
SO THEY EAT THIS FLOWER?

32:33.785 --> 32:36.322
INGEST IT.

32:36.355 --> 32:40.292
SNUFF AND, UH,
SOMETIMES CHEWING TOBACCO.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.628
WELL, IT'S IN MOST
OF THEIR FOOD.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.597
GROWS WILD, A HUNDRED FEET UP
IN THE CANOPY.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.466
TEN STORIES UP?

32:47.499 --> 32:49.135
MMM, ON THE TOP SHELF

32:49.168 --> 32:52.371
OF THE PHARMACOLOGICAL
SUPERSTORE.

32:52.404 --> 32:55.674
LIVES OFF A TREE.

32:55.707 --> 32:58.277
I'D SEEN THE OLD MEDICINE MAN
UP THERE

32:58.310 --> 33:02.314
GATHERING FOR HIS JUJU KIT.

33:02.348 --> 33:06.385
AND THERE IT WAS.

33:06.418 --> 33:11.323
THERE'S ONLY ONE FLY
IN THE SERUM.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.359
I CAN'T REPRODUCE IT.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.466
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

33:20.499 --> 33:23.502
NONE OF THE NEW
SAMPLES WORK.

33:23.535 --> 33:27.473
AND I HAVE VERY LITTLE
OF THE ORIGINAL SERUM LEFT.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.242
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY
I CAN'T REPRODUCE IT.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.644
WAIT A MINUTE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.714
WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?!

33:35.747 --> 33:37.716
I FOUND A CURE
FOR THE FUCKIN' PLAGUE

33:37.749 --> 33:40.252
OF THE 20th CENTURY,
AND NOW I'VE LOST IT!

33:40.286 --> 33:42.754
HAVEN'T YOU EVER LOST ANYTHING,
DR. BRONX?

33:42.788 --> 33:44.823
YOUR PURSE, YOUR CAR KEYS?

33:44.856 --> 33:46.325
WELL, IT'S RATHER LIKE THAT.

33:46.358 --> 33:47.993
NOW YOU HAVE IT.
NOW YOU DON'T.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.528
YOUR NOTES ARE GONE?

33:49.561 --> 33:51.397
I HAVE MY NOTES.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.233
I FOLLOWED MY NOTES.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.434
YOUR NOTES MUST BE WRONG.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.436
THEY'RE NOT.

33:57.469 --> 34:01.740
THEN EXPLAIN IT.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.975
I--I CAN'T.

34:07.479 --> 34:11.350
OKAY.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.051
THE FIRST THING I DO
WHEN I GET TO L.A.

34:13.085 --> 34:14.453
IS I GET DR. CROWSON.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.755
HIS PEOPLE CAN SET
UP A REAL LAB DOWN HERE.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.690
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THIS LAB.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.391
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.460
LOOK...

34:22.494 --> 34:24.295
THIS IS MAJOR LEAGUE.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.264
YOU NEED HELP.

34:26.297 --> 34:30.068
I PROMISE YOU WILL GET
FULL CREDIT.

34:30.101 --> 34:31.603
DO YOU THINK
I GIVE A DAMN

34:31.637 --> 34:34.739
ABOUT THE IMMORTAL
TEXTBOOK QUOTE?

34:34.773 --> 34:37.376
DARE I INSULT YOU
WITH A HISTORY LESSON?

34:37.409 --> 34:41.447
NO, BETTER STILL,
HOW ABOUT SUBTRACTION?

34:41.480 --> 34:44.983
9 MILLION INDIANS
IN THE AMAZON.

34:45.016 --> 34:48.754
WHITE MEN BRING MEASLES, FLU,
POLIO, AND CHICKEN POX.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.422
NOW YOU'VE GOT 200,000 INDIANS.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.757
WITHOUT USING YOUR FINGERS,

34:52.791 --> 34:54.993
JUST HOW MANY DID WE SHOVE
IN THE HOLE?

34:55.025 --> 34:56.728
IT'S NOT THEY'LL
BE UNVACCINATED.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.797
THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE
WORKING FOR ASTON.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.632
ALL PRECAUTIONS WOULD BE TAKEN.

35:00.666 --> 35:06.305
YOU DON'T REMEMBER MOCARA,
DO YOU?

35:06.338 --> 35:09.107
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.443
SOME OVEREAGER
SON OF A BITCH

35:11.477 --> 35:13.779
FOUND A GREAT LITTLE PAINKILLER
IN THE JUNGLE.

35:13.812 --> 35:17.649
$0.15 TO MAKE A $5 BOTTLE.

35:17.683 --> 35:20.085
ASTON WAS ONTO IT
LIKE A FLY TO DUNG.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.587
ALL VERY SCIENTIFIC.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.756
ALL PRECAUTIONS TAKEN.

35:24.790 --> 35:29.127
SWINE FLU KILLED
THE ENTIRE VILLAGE.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.797
MUCH REGRET.
SO SORRY.

35:31.830 --> 35:35.467
BUT THE EAGER BEAVER STILL ENDED
UP WITH HIS $0.10 ON THE DOLLAR.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.102
THIS ISN'T A PAINKILLER.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.704
THIS IS THE CURE FOR CANCER.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.806
THESE PEOPLE DON'T
NEED A CURE FOR CANCER.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.474
ASK THEM.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.343
THERE'S A ROAD
COMING INTO THE AREA.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.111
YOU'RE FINISHED.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.679
ASTON CAN STOP THAT.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.147
ASTON WILL NEED THE ROAD.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.549
THEY'LL MAKE SURE
THAT IT LEADS

35:50.582 --> 35:51.817
RIGHT UP TO MY PALAPA.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.452
HOW CAN I GO--

35:53.485 --> 35:55.554
HOW CAN YOU GO BACK
WHEN I NEED YOU HERE?

35:55.587 --> 35:57.155
WHAT?

35:57.189 --> 35:59.157
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.627
I'M A DAMN GOOD BIOCHEMIST.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.495
I'M NOT A FIELD RESEARCHER.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.996
I HAVEN'T DONE
THIS WORK FOR YEARS.

36:05.030 --> 36:07.065
I'M NOT QUALIFIED.

36:07.098 --> 36:08.166
I KNOW.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.168
TOO MANY FOUNDATION FUNDRAISERS.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.404
TOO MANY SUBCOMMITTEES.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.806
TAKE TWO GUINEA PIGS
AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.409
WELL,
WHEN YOU'RE OLD AND GRAY,

36:17.443 --> 36:22.013
YOU'LL PUT LILIES ON MY GRAVE
AND WISH YOU COULD THANK ME.

36:22.047 --> 36:23.815
YEAH, WELL,
I'LL THANK YOU NOW,

36:23.849 --> 36:25.551
BUT I'M STILL LEAVING.

36:25.584 --> 36:28.487
[chuckles]

36:28.520 --> 36:31.657
HOW?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.725
CAMPBELL...

36:33.759 --> 36:35.661
I'M NOT YOUR PRISONER.

36:35.694 --> 36:39.097
NO, YOU'RE
MY RESEARCH ASSISTANT.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.633
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF HEIGHTS,
ARE YOU, BRONX?

37:09.127 --> 37:11.162
RIGHT FOOT.
AND UP.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.502
[grunts]

37:21.239 --> 37:23.609
THERE YOU ARE.

37:27.479 --> 37:31.617
YOU GIVE THE CUTAWAY
A GOOD YANK...

37:31.650 --> 37:33.452
AND UP YOU GO.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.220
EH?

37:35.253 --> 37:37.456
WELL, COME ON.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.190
I WANT YOU TO SEE.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.000
WHOO!

37:49.034 --> 37:51.036
OH!

37:59.811 --> 38:02.247
COME ON.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.250
OOH.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.185
OH.

38:07.218 --> 38:09.621
ALL RIGHT.

38:09.655 --> 38:12.558
DR. BRONX.

38:15.226 --> 38:18.296
LEFT LEG FIRST.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.531
THERE.

38:19.565 --> 38:23.469
NOW THE RIGHT.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.203
[grunts]

38:25.236 --> 38:26.772
THERE YOU ARE.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.007
THIS UP HERE.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.145
OH!

38:34.179 --> 38:36.181
ALL RIGHT?

38:42.153 --> 38:43.622
COME ON.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.724
OH, GOD.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.993
THINK OF NEIL ARMSTRONG.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.759
ALL RIGHT.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.729
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE WEEK.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.665
DID YOU HEAR ME?

40:33.699 --> 40:35.300
THEY'RE NOT IN ABUNDANCE.

40:35.333 --> 40:38.737
IF YOU FIND ONE,
PLOP IT IN THE BAG.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.806
OH!

40:40.839 --> 40:43.642
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE?

40:43.675 --> 40:45.611
YES.

40:45.644 --> 40:49.280
LIKE THIS.

40:49.314 --> 40:52.017
WHATEVER THIS FLOWER NEEDS
TO FERTILIZE,

40:52.050 --> 40:54.620
IT GETS IT UP HERE.

40:54.653 --> 40:58.089
WHETHER IT'S A AN AIR STREAM
BEING TRANSFERRED

40:58.123 --> 41:01.627
BY AN INSECT FOR THE POLLEN,
OR GOD KNOWS WHAT

41:01.660 --> 41:03.328
LEAKING OUT OF THE TREE--

41:03.361 --> 41:05.096
COULD BE ANYTHING.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.331
IT COULD BE EVERYTHING.

41:06.364 --> 41:07.699
THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF THIS SYSTEM.

41:07.733 --> 41:11.002
YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.

41:11.036 --> 41:13.004
YOU CAN ONLY WIPE IT OUT.

42:22.040 --> 42:27.212
IS THAT THE ROAD?

42:27.245 --> 42:29.681
YOU SEE THE RIVER?

42:29.715 --> 42:34.419
NO ONE CAN REMEMBER IT
EVER BEING THIS LOW.

42:34.452 --> 42:36.254
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE RAIN?

42:36.287 --> 42:38.356
EVERY YEAR IT RAINS LESS.

42:38.389 --> 42:42.360
LESS RAINFOREST
MEANS LESS RAIN.

42:42.393 --> 42:48.266
THE INDIANS HAVE ASKED ME
TO PRAY FOR A DELUGE.

42:48.299 --> 42:53.238
DO YOU PRAY, BRONX?

42:53.271 --> 42:55.073
THERE'S SO MUCH SMOKE.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.407
I DIDN'T KNOW THE ROAD
WAS SO CLOSE.

42:56.441 --> 42:59.444
YES, WELL,
DEATH IS INEVITABLE, DR. BRONX.

42:59.477 --> 43:01.747
BUT IT'S CONSIDERED BAD FORM
TO DISCUSS IT

43:01.780 --> 43:03.749
OVER A MAN'S SICK-BED,
ALL RIGHT?

43:03.782 --> 43:05.651
YEAH, WELL,
CLOSING YOUR EYES

43:05.684 --> 43:07.318
WON'T MAKE IT DISAPPEAR.

43:07.352 --> 43:09.154
NEITHER WILL TALK.

43:09.187 --> 43:11.356
LET'S GO.

43:34.345 --> 43:35.747
YOU'RE A LUNATIC.

43:35.781 --> 43:38.183
I'LL SHOW YOU A SHORTCUT!

43:40.451 --> 43:42.287
WOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

43:42.320 --> 43:44.990
WHOO-HA-HA-HA!

43:45.023 --> 43:48.093
OH, GOD, OH, GOD.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.460
WHEN WAS IT MADE?

43:49.494 --> 43:51.362
WHAT?

43:51.396 --> 43:54.132
THE EIGHTH SAMPLE,
WHEN WAS IT MADE?

43:54.165 --> 43:57.102
UH, DATA SHEETS.
GREEN NOTEBOOK, TOP LEFT.

43:57.135 --> 43:58.469
YOU DON'T SMOKE, DO YOU?

43:58.503 --> 44:00.371
NO, I QUIT.

44:00.405 --> 44:02.207
GOOD GOD.
WHY?

44:02.240 --> 44:04.309
THEY'VE BEEN MISSING FROM
THE LAST THREE SHIPMENTS.

44:04.342 --> 44:07.245
I SUSPECT JAHAUSA'S GOT
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

44:11.582 --> 44:15.220
YOUR OTHER LEFT.

44:18.156 --> 44:20.158
LAST ONE.

44:26.397 --> 44:29.034
HMM.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.336
OKAY, LOOK.

44:31.369 --> 44:34.472
HERE'S THE ORIGINAL EXTRACT,
THE ONE THAT WORKS.

44:34.505 --> 44:39.144
HERE'S THE EIGHT SUBSEQUENT ONES
THAT DON'T WORK.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.813
YOU NOTICE ANYTHING?

44:41.847 --> 44:44.482
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

44:44.515 --> 44:49.054
IT'S MISSING
FROM EVERY FAILED SAMPLE.

44:49.087 --> 44:51.823
PEAK 37.

44:51.857 --> 44:53.358
DID YOU VARY THE SOLUTION?

44:53.391 --> 44:55.994
NO.

44:56.027 --> 44:59.197
YOU THINK THE BROMELIAD
CHANGES CHEMISTRY

44:59.230 --> 45:01.266
DURING ITS LIFE CYCLE?

45:01.299 --> 45:03.434
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

45:03.468 --> 45:05.203
BUT ALL THESE SAMPLES ARE DATED

45:05.236 --> 45:08.439
WITHIN TWO WEEKS
OF EACH OTHER.

45:08.473 --> 45:10.541
MAYBE THE FIRST BATCH
WAS CONTAMINATED.

45:10.575 --> 45:13.244
MAYBE PEAK 37 IS A FUNGUS.

45:13.278 --> 45:16.114
NO, I SCREENED EVERY SAMPLE,

45:16.147 --> 45:18.249
INCLUDING THE FIRST ONE.

45:18.283 --> 45:21.352
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE YOU USED
A DIRTY TEST TUBE.

45:21.386 --> 45:22.587
WHO KNOWS?

45:22.620 --> 45:24.555
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A THOUSAND VARIATIONS

45:24.589 --> 45:27.225
ON THIS PLANT EXTRACT
AND WE'VE GOTTA MAKE AND TEST

45:27.258 --> 45:29.227
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

45:29.260 --> 45:32.263
I TELL YOU, WE NEED HELP.

45:35.133 --> 45:38.069
WE'RE LOOKING AT
TOO MANY POSSIBILITIES.

45:38.103 --> 45:39.570
ISN'T THAT WHAT SCIENCE
IS ALL ABOUT?

45:39.604 --> 45:42.473
ELIMINATING POSSIBILITIES?

45:45.110 --> 45:48.146
[speaking native language
indistinctly]

46:47.672 --> 46:49.474
WELL?

46:49.507 --> 46:52.210
YOU SAID YOU NEEDED HELP.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.482
OKAY, JAHAUSA,
CAN YOU TELL THEM

46:57.515 --> 47:00.151
THAT I NEED THEM
TO BREAK IT FROM THE ROOT?

47:00.185 --> 47:01.452
KEEP THAT ROOT.

47:01.486 --> 47:03.621
[speaking native language]

47:03.654 --> 47:05.656
HOW WE DOING?

47:10.495 --> 47:13.698
TELL HER IF SHE BREAKS
THE LEAVES, IT'S EASIER.

47:13.731 --> 47:15.400
IF SHE BREAKS THEM--

47:15.433 --> 47:16.701
SEE, THEY'RE TOO BIG.

47:16.734 --> 47:19.304
IMANA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY WAY?

47:19.337 --> 47:20.571
HOW YOU DOING?

47:20.605 --> 47:22.407
GOOD.

47:22.440 --> 47:23.474
THIS IS EXCELLENT.

47:23.508 --> 47:26.477
[speaking native language]

47:26.511 --> 47:29.680
[laughs]

47:29.714 --> 47:32.250
HI, ARE YOU BREAKING THEM
FROM THE ROOTS?

47:32.283 --> 47:34.652
YOU GOTTA BREAK 'EM
FROM THE ROOTS, OKAY?

47:34.685 --> 47:36.621
UH, IT'S KALANA.
HI.

47:39.124 --> 47:41.126
OKAY.

48:51.196 --> 48:54.265
[speaking native language]

48:57.668 --> 49:00.638
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M SORRY.

49:00.671 --> 49:03.574
DEPSWA!
[speaking native language]

49:03.608 --> 49:08.346
[replies in foreign language]

49:08.379 --> 49:11.349
[laughter]

49:13.351 --> 49:15.286
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.521
HE JUST WANTS TO KNOW IF
YOU HAVE A DATE FOR THE PROM,

49:16.554 --> 49:18.656
EUPHEMISTICALLY SPEAKING.

49:22.693 --> 49:24.762
WHY ARE THEY STARING AT ME?

49:24.795 --> 49:28.633
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN
A VIRGIN OF YOUR MATURITY.

49:28.666 --> 49:30.001
WHAT?

49:30.035 --> 49:32.337
I HAD TO GIVE THEM
SOME EXCUSE.

49:32.370 --> 49:33.471
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID,

49:33.504 --> 49:35.206
"SHE'S ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED."

49:35.240 --> 49:36.507
REALLY?

49:36.541 --> 49:38.309
OH, IT'S TO BE MRS. BRONX?

49:38.343 --> 49:41.012
IT WILL BE NEXT WINTER.

49:41.046 --> 49:42.547
I DON'T APPROVE
OF LONG ENGAGEMENTS.

49:42.580 --> 49:44.682
WE WOULDA LIKED TO HAVE
GOTTEN MARRIED EARLIER,

49:44.715 --> 49:46.351
BUT IT WASN'T CONVENIENT.

49:46.384 --> 49:48.453
AH, A MARRIAGE
OF CONVENIENCE.

49:48.486 --> 49:52.723
YOU PROBABLY KNOW HIM,
OR AT LEAST HIS FAMILY.

49:52.757 --> 49:56.461
TOM FALLON?

49:56.494 --> 49:58.463
TOMMY FALLON?

49:58.496 --> 50:00.665
GOOD GOD, HE'S ABOUT
95 YEARS OLD.

50:00.698 --> 50:03.234
YOU'LL INHERIT
BEFORE THE HONEYMOON'S OVER.

50:03.268 --> 50:06.671
I TAKE MY HAT OFF
TO YOU, GIRL.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.706
HIS SON.

50:08.739 --> 50:10.375
OH, HIS SON?

50:10.408 --> 50:11.742
NO, I DON'T KNOW THE SON,

50:11.776 --> 50:13.744
BUT I CAN WELL IMAGINE.

50:13.778 --> 50:15.546
GOOD STOCK.

50:15.580 --> 50:17.382
GOOD CONTRIBUTOR.

50:17.415 --> 50:19.217
MET AT A FUNDRAISER, DID WE?

50:19.250 --> 50:21.386
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
WHERE I MET HIM?

50:21.419 --> 50:24.222
DON'T GET YOUR KNICKERS
IN A TWIST, MRS. BRONX.

50:24.255 --> 50:28.759
JUST REMEMBER, BREEDING IS
NO SUBSTITUTE FOR INTELLIGENCE.

50:28.793 --> 50:33.731
OFTEN THE DEATH OF IT.

50:33.764 --> 50:35.600
WHAT DO YOU HAVE,
AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY

50:35.633 --> 50:37.735
OF THAT STUFF?

50:40.238 --> 50:45.276
THE SALIVA SPEEDS UP
THE FERMENTATION PROCESS.

50:45.310 --> 50:47.345
PASS.

50:47.378 --> 50:48.713
WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL.

50:48.746 --> 50:51.349
YOU CAN'T TEST THIS LOT
FOR ANOTHER 72 HOURS.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.084
IT'LL GO BY JUST AS FAST

50:53.118 --> 50:55.253
IF WE'RE TESTING
THE LOCAL FUNGUS.

50:55.286 --> 51:01.092
I TOLD YOU
I SCREENED EVERY SAMPLE.

51:01.126 --> 51:03.694
WELL, THERE IS ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY.

51:03.728 --> 51:05.530
WHICH IS?

51:05.563 --> 51:08.299
A SIX-PACK
OF PEACH "PEAR-NOD,"

51:08.333 --> 51:09.634
AND YOU WERE DRUNKER
THAN A SKUNK

51:09.667 --> 51:11.035
WHEN YOU DID THE TEST.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.537
PERNOD.

51:12.570 --> 51:14.305
THE "D" IS SILENT.

51:14.339 --> 51:16.241
IF YOU'RE GONNA HANG AROUND
WITH THE FALLONS,

51:16.274 --> 51:17.742
YOU BETTER GET IT RIGHT, KID.

51:17.775 --> 51:20.044
PERNOD.
MM-HMM.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.246
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

51:21.279 --> 51:22.980
SHALL I WRITE
IT DOWN FOR YOU?

51:29.320 --> 51:32.457
WHAT IF THE MISSING STEP
ISN'T HERE IN THE LAB?

51:32.490 --> 51:35.760
YOUR MEDICINE MAN,
THE FIRST DAY YOU SAW HIM

51:35.793 --> 51:38.629
COLLECT THE BROMELIADS,
WHAT IF HE DID SOMETHING?

51:38.663 --> 51:40.465
I DON'T KNOW.

51:40.498 --> 51:42.500
SOMETHING YOU INSTINCTIVELY
COPIED THAT FIRST TIME

51:42.533 --> 51:44.569
AND HAVEN'T DONE SINCE.

51:44.602 --> 51:47.272
WHAT IF IT'S IN THE HARVESTING?

51:47.305 --> 51:50.341
I COUNTED AT LEAST
THREE WHAT-IFS.

51:50.375 --> 51:53.411
YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T START
AN INVESTIGATION

51:53.444 --> 51:54.745
WITH, "ONCE UPON A TIME,"
DO YOU?

51:54.779 --> 51:56.614
EXACTLY WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO INVESTIGATE?

51:56.647 --> 51:58.483
NOT WHAT, WHO.

51:58.516 --> 52:02.620
YOUR MERRY MEN MUST KNOW
WHERE THE MEDICINE MAN IS.

52:02.653 --> 52:05.590
WE SHOULD GO AND QUESTION HIM.

52:05.623 --> 52:08.459
AS YOU YOURSELF POINTED OUT,
YOU'RE SCARCELY

52:08.493 --> 52:10.495
A QUALIFIED FIELD RESEARCHER.

52:16.667 --> 52:19.370
AND AS YOU'VE POINTED OUT,

52:19.404 --> 52:21.806
RESEARCH IS A PROCESS
OF ELIMINATION.

52:21.839 --> 52:25.009
DON'T YOU PRESUME
TO TELL ME HOW TO FOLLOW UP.

52:25.042 --> 52:27.111
"QUESTION THE MEDICINE MAN."
GOOD GOD.

52:27.144 --> 52:30.147
DON'T YOU THINK I QUESTIONED
THE SON OF A BITCH?

52:42.026 --> 52:44.128
[children chattering]

52:44.161 --> 52:46.364
OCUPADO.
OCUPADO!

52:46.397 --> 52:49.033
UH, UH,
[speaks foreign language]

52:49.066 --> 52:51.068
UH, SOMEWHERE ELSE!

52:51.101 --> 52:53.571
RELAX.
RELAX.

52:53.604 --> 52:56.140
THEY KNOW NOT TO URINATE
IN THE WATER.

52:56.173 --> 52:58.142
THAT'S NOT MY CONCERN.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.477
WELL, IT SHOULD BE.

52:59.510 --> 53:01.679
URINE ATTRACTS
THE SPIKY CANDIRU.

53:01.712 --> 53:03.548
IT'S A RELATIVELY TINY FISH

53:03.581 --> 53:05.015
THAT ENTERS
ANY AVAILABLE ORIFICE.

53:05.049 --> 53:06.651
LOOK, CAN'T YOU BLOW
A WHISTLE?

53:06.684 --> 53:09.420
MAYBE THEY'D LIKE
TO FETCH SOME GOLF BALLS?

53:09.454 --> 53:11.155
THE SPIKES
ARE ANGLED BACKWARDS

53:11.188 --> 53:12.757
AND HAVE
TO BE SURGICALLY REMOVED.

53:12.790 --> 53:14.659
IT'S A HELL OF A PROCEDURE.

53:14.692 --> 53:16.494
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

53:16.527 --> 53:17.728
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

53:17.762 --> 53:19.096
I LOST MY TEMPER.

53:19.129 --> 53:20.598
ABOUT THE SPIKES?

53:20.631 --> 53:22.367
NO, ABOUT THE MEDICINE MAN.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.701
GOD DAMN IT, CAMPBELL.

53:23.734 --> 53:25.069
THE SPIKY CANDIRU.

53:25.102 --> 53:27.004
GOOD GOD, WHERE?

53:27.037 --> 53:30.040
HEY!
[speaking foreign language]

53:33.110 --> 53:35.446
MUST ADMIT I'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY SEEN ONE

53:35.480 --> 53:37.715
THIS FAR UPRIVER,
BUT IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA

53:37.748 --> 53:38.749
TO KEEP YOUR KNICKERS ON.

53:38.783 --> 53:41.085
OH!

53:41.118 --> 53:43.354
WELL, ALL GONE.

53:43.388 --> 53:46.424
SATISFIED?

53:46.457 --> 53:51.729
I DIDN'T MEAN TO JUMP DOWN
YOUR THROAT THIS AFTERNOON.

53:51.762 --> 53:54.632
WELL, THEN I ACCEPT
YOUR APOLOGY.

53:54.665 --> 53:56.767
LET'S FORGET IT.

53:56.801 --> 53:58.769
THE, UH--THE MEDICINE MAN,

53:58.803 --> 54:00.705
HE WOULDN'T
ANSWER MY QUESTIONS

54:00.738 --> 54:06.076
UNTIL I GOT UP TO LEAVE,
AND THEN HE SPOKE ONE WORD.

54:06.110 --> 54:07.445
MOCARA.

54:07.478 --> 54:10.581
THE SWINE FLU EPIDEMIC?

54:10.615 --> 54:12.417
YOU TOLD ME.

54:12.450 --> 54:13.651
AH, YEAH.

54:13.684 --> 54:15.753
WELL, THEY, UH--

54:15.786 --> 54:19.457
HE WAS AFRAID, YOU SEE,
BECAUSE IN MOCARA,

54:19.490 --> 54:23.994
THEIR MEDICINE MAN HAD SHARED
FORBIDDEN JUJU MAGIC

54:24.028 --> 54:27.131
WITH THE EAGER BEAVER...

54:27.164 --> 54:31.636
AND SWINE FLU WAS
THE GODS' PUNISHMENT

54:31.669 --> 54:33.103
FOR THAT INDISCRETION.

54:33.137 --> 54:34.639
ALL RIGHT.

54:34.672 --> 54:35.773
HE WOULDN'T TALK.

54:35.806 --> 54:37.642
HE MIGHT TALK TO ME.

54:37.675 --> 54:39.444
A WOMAN?

54:39.477 --> 54:41.078
LOOK, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

54:41.111 --> 54:42.613
SIT ON YOUR HANDS
FOR THREE DAYS

54:42.647 --> 54:46.016
AND PRAY FOR PEAK 37?

54:46.050 --> 54:47.452
WE COULD TAKE JAHAUSA.

54:47.485 --> 54:48.619
HE COULD PLEAD OUR CASE.

54:48.653 --> 54:52.089
YOU COULD SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

54:52.122 --> 54:55.225
I DON'T THINK
HE KNOWS IT WAS ME.

54:57.828 --> 55:04.168
I MEANT SORRY
FOR THE ALKA-SELTZER.

55:04.201 --> 55:07.338
THOUGHT YOU MEANT MOCARA.

56:09.767 --> 56:11.702
AAH!

56:17.708 --> 56:20.511
DEPSWA.

56:20.545 --> 56:22.179
[speaking native language]

56:22.212 --> 56:23.614
IMANA.

56:23.648 --> 56:25.583
[speaking native language]

56:25.616 --> 56:27.184
IMANA.

56:27.217 --> 56:30.054
[speaking native language]

56:33.257 --> 56:35.225
IMANA.

56:35.259 --> 56:38.295
[speaking native language]

56:50.140 --> 56:54.979
SAME STORY AS THE MOTHER.

56:55.012 --> 56:58.649
SUPRACLAVICULAR NODE,
NON-TENDER...

56:58.683 --> 57:04.221
AND ADHERING
TO THE SURROUNDING TISSUES.

57:04.254 --> 57:06.123
HOW BIG WOULD YOU SAY?

57:06.156 --> 57:09.293
ONE CENTIMETER.

57:09.326 --> 57:11.662
THEN GIVE IT TWO.

57:21.271 --> 57:23.608
YOU CAN'T AND YOU KNOW IT.

57:23.641 --> 57:25.743
IT'S SO CLOSE
TO HIS WINDPIPE

57:25.776 --> 57:28.278
HE'LL CHOKE TO DEATH BEFORE
THE CANCER KILLS HIM.

57:28.312 --> 57:29.780
IT'S NOT A WEED.
IT'S A TUMOR.

57:29.814 --> 57:31.281
IT CAN WAIT.

57:31.315 --> 57:33.017
IT'S NOT A TUMOR.
IT'S A CHILD.

57:33.050 --> 57:35.620
THE CHILD CAN WAIT TOO.

57:35.653 --> 57:38.288
YOU USE UP THE LAST BIT
OF THE WORKING SERUM,

57:38.322 --> 57:39.757
AND WE HAVE NOTHING.

57:39.790 --> 57:41.626
YOU CAN'T USE THE LAST OF IT.

57:41.659 --> 57:42.760
WE KNOW THE MOLECULE.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.094
A PICTURE!

57:44.128 --> 57:45.162
A GHOST IN THE MACHINE!

57:45.195 --> 57:46.363
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, CAMPBELL,

57:46.396 --> 57:48.265
USE YOUR HEAD!

57:48.298 --> 57:51.669
THE BOY WON'T DIE
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

57:51.702 --> 57:56.006
LOOK, ONE OF THOSE BEAKERS
SPROUT PEAK 37,

57:56.040 --> 57:58.108
YOU CAN GIVE SAMPLES AWAY
FOR CHRISTMAS.

57:58.142 --> 58:00.678
I'LL HELP YOU WRAP.

58:00.711 --> 58:05.149
SUPPOSE THE NEW SERUMS
DON'T WORK?

58:05.182 --> 58:07.652
YOU SAID YOURSELF
YOU FOUND THE CURE

58:07.685 --> 58:09.654
FOR THE PLAGUE
OF THIS CENTURY.

58:09.687 --> 58:11.455
IT BELONGS TO THE HUMAN RACE,

58:11.488 --> 58:13.490
NOT TO ONE SICK KID.

58:18.663 --> 58:22.066
DEPSWA?

58:22.099 --> 58:25.135
COME ON,
GIMME THAT SYRINGE.

58:25.169 --> 58:28.005
IT'LL BE MY SLEEPLESS NIGHT.

58:44.221 --> 58:47.224
[speaking foreign language
indistinctly]

58:52.462 --> 58:55.432
JAHAUSA'S TAKING HIS SON
TO THE MEDICINE MAN.

58:55.465 --> 58:58.202
WHEN SHE WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
THEY WERE BOTH GONE.

58:58.235 --> 59:00.270
SHE WANTS ME
TO BRING THEM BACK.

59:00.304 --> 59:01.739
MEDICINE MAN?

59:01.772 --> 59:03.407
KALANA,
WHERE'S THE MEDICINE MAN?

59:03.440 --> 59:05.009
[speaking native language]

59:05.042 --> 59:06.443
WHAT IS SHE SAYING?

59:06.476 --> 59:08.278
SAYING JAHAUSA'S A FOOL--

59:08.312 --> 59:11.115
WHO CAN SHOW US WHERE
THE MEDICINE MAN IS?

59:11.148 --> 59:12.449
PALALA.

59:12.482 --> 59:15.085
PALALA?
PALALA CAN SHOW US.

59:15.119 --> 59:17.021
CAN'T HEAR YOU!

59:17.054 --> 59:18.422
LOOK, GET OUT OF THERE!

59:18.455 --> 59:21.091
IF WE LEAVE NOW,
WE CAN CATCH UP TO JAHAUSA!

59:21.125 --> 59:22.459
CAN'T HEAR YOU!

59:22.492 --> 59:24.428
YOU GOT SOME HISTORY--

59:24.461 --> 59:26.196
FINE, IT'S HISTORY.

59:26.230 --> 59:27.431
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

59:27.464 --> 59:29.734
DRAG IT AROUND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

59:29.767 --> 59:32.402
IF THAT MAN HAS ANSWERS,
WE NEED THEM!

59:32.436 --> 59:34.071
I CAN'T HEAR--

59:34.104 --> 59:36.240
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:23.287
[gasps]

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.454
WHAT IS IT?

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:26.323
HEADACHE.

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:27.457
KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THE GROUND,

01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:28.759
YOU WON'T CHANGE FOCUS,

01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:30.294
YOU WON'T GET A HEADACHE.

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:32.429
YOU MIGHT HAVE
MENTIONED IT EARLIER.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.264
OH, DIDN'T I?
I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT I DID.

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:36.333
PALALA?
[speaking foreign language]

01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:43.307
OH, NO.
I GOT SOMETHING BETTER.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.775
GIVE IT.

01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:48.345
NO, NO.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.681
[sighs]

01:00:50.715 --> 01:00:52.116
WHAT IS IT?

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:53.217
YOKO TREE.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.319
THE BARK IS 3% PURE CAFFEINE.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:57.054
CURES HEADACHES, FATIGUE,

01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:59.289
ACHES, PAINS,
NEURITIS, NEURALGIA.

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:00.991
DRINK IT.

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:02.459
IT'LL KEEP YOU ON YOUR FEET
TILL DINNERTIME.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.128
PASS.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.730
DRINK IT.
PASS.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:07.732
DRINK IT...

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:09.299
OR PALALA WILL
FORCE YOU ON YOUR BACK,

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:12.069
CLOSE YOUR NOSE, WHILE I
POUR IT DOWN YOUR GULLET.

01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:13.470
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PALALA?

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:16.140
[chuckles]
UH-HUH, "GULLET."

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.175
GO AHEAD.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:27.184
[gags]

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:28.352
WHOA!

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:30.320
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS BARK?

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:32.189
IT'S CALLED YOKO.

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:33.490
YOKO.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.092
YOU KNOW, THIS WOULD KNOCK
MAXWELL HOUSE

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:37.327
RIGHT OFF THE SHELF...

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:40.330
IF THE NARCS WOULDN'T STOP ME
AT THE BORDER.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:41.732
[gasps]

01:01:41.766 --> 01:01:43.968
OOH.

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:55.579
THIS ISN'T
A HALLUCINOGEN IS IT?

01:10:25.489 --> 01:10:27.691
* BUT WHAT COULD I DO

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:30.193
* I HEAR YOUR NAME

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:34.097
* I'M IN A FLAME

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:37.200
COME ON, SING IT.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.202
GET SOME SLEEP, RAE.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.071
DON'T!

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:44.608
WHAT?

01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:47.311
DON'T CALL ME
BY MY GIVEN NAME.

01:10:47.344 --> 01:10:52.215
DON'T YOU LIKE IT?

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.483
[sighs]

01:10:53.517 --> 01:10:55.652
YEAH, I LIKE IT.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:36.159
[gasps]

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.522
CAMPBELL?

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:07.557
READY FOR VISITORS?

01:12:10.193 --> 01:12:13.062
UGH.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:14.998
THE MEDICINE MAN?

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:16.800
HE'S IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:20.203
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

01:12:20.236 --> 01:12:22.171
CALL IT A HUNCH.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:30.480
WE MIGHT BE
IN THE WRONG GORGE.

01:12:30.514 --> 01:12:32.516
OH, SOMEHOW I DOUBT THAT.

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:37.153
I MEAN, ARE YOU SURE PALALA
KNOWS WHERE HE LIVES?

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.488
OH, YEAH.

01:12:38.522 --> 01:12:39.689
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?

01:12:39.723 --> 01:12:44.494
WHAT DO WE DO THEN?

01:12:44.528 --> 01:12:46.530
[moans]

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:56.640
I THOUGHT I WAS DREAMING.

01:13:01.244 --> 01:13:03.246
CAMPBELL, I THOUGHT--

01:13:05.649 --> 01:13:08.752
[speaking native language]

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:20.063
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:23.066
IT SEEMS THERE'S GOING
TO BE A FIGHT.

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:24.734
BETWEEN YOU AND HIM?

01:13:24.768 --> 01:13:27.737
MM-HMM.

01:13:27.771 --> 01:13:31.074
HE'S THREE FEET TALL,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:13:31.107 --> 01:13:33.076
YOU WANTED
TO PICK HIS BRAINS.

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:35.344
NOT OFF THE SIDEWALK.

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:39.749
EVER MOUTH OFF
TO THE DEAN,

01:13:39.783 --> 01:13:42.719
AND THEN NEED A GRANT?

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.621
OH.

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:47.156
THIS IS A EAT-CROW,
KISS-ASS CONTEST?

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:48.625
EXACTLY.

01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:52.061
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
ABOUT TAKING HIS STICK?

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:54.397
I THINK THIS IS
ABOUT GIVING IT BACK.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.600
SO HE'S GOTTA WIN?

01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:57.634
MM-HMM.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.135
OKAY.

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:00.336
BEND OVER,
TAKE THREE WHACKS,

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.305
AND LET'S CUT TO THE INFO.

01:14:02.338 --> 01:14:04.608
IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK
THAT WAY.

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:06.776
[speaking native language]

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:07.777
THE TRICKY PART IS--

01:14:07.811 --> 01:14:09.613
IS WHAT?

01:14:09.646 --> 01:14:14.317
NOT GETTING MY SKULL CRACKED
IN THE PROCESS.

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:16.319

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:29.032
[speaking native language]

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:36.372
TELL HIM HIS MOTHER
EATS ARMY BOOTS.

HE'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN COUSINS MARRY!

01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:53.222
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE--

01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:54.624
AH!

01:14:54.658 --> 01:14:56.993
[speaking native language]

01:14:57.026 --> 01:14:58.461
I WAS HELPING.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.129
WELL, DON'T!

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:02.065
[speaking native language]

01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:06.402
I DON'T NEED
A BLOODY INTERPRETER.

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:09.005
I DO.

01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:10.740
[grunts]

01:15:10.774 --> 01:15:12.809
DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK, RUNT.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:15.011
CAMPBELL.

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.349
[speaking foreign language]

01:15:24.387 --> 01:15:26.322
OH, YEAH.
NICE KISS.

[speaking native language]

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:02.225
WHAT?

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:04.127
WHAT'D HE SAY?
WHAT'D HE SAY?

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.162
AH!

01:16:09.733 --> 01:16:12.135
WHAT'D HE SAY?
WHAT'D HE SAY?

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:40.463
BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:42.398
WHERE DID I GO WRONG?

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.467
THE EATING CROW
OR THE KISSING ASS DEPARTMENT?

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:48.271
HMM?

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:50.306
IT WASN'T A TOTAL LOSS.

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:59.482
[speaking native language]

01:17:39.756 --> 01:17:42.992
[speaking native language]

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:04.380
MY, MY.

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:08.517
ISN'T IT ALL BRIGHT AND SHINY?

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:11.020
I CLEANED UP A LITTLE,
THAT'S ALL.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:20.029
THESE FIRST FOUR EXTRACTS
WILL BE READY TO TEST BY 7:00.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:24.333
I'LL SET MY ALARM CLOCK
FOR 6:30.

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:29.105
INCIDENTALLY,
THE BLUE DOESN'T COME OFF.

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:31.440
GET DRUNK SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:34.243
HEY, I LIVE HERE.

01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:38.181
GET SANCTIMONIOUS
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:40.183
I TRIED TO GET DRUNK
AT JAHAUSA'S,

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:42.051
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

01:18:42.085 --> 01:18:44.287
BUT I SOON TIRED
OF HEARING HIM PRAY

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.023
OVER HIS ONLY SON.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:49.793
SO I SAID TO MYSELF,
"WHY NOT VISIT DR. BRONX

01:18:49.826 --> 01:18:55.598
AND HER TABERNACLE
OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE?"

01:18:55.631 --> 01:18:57.466
I'M NOT A MONSTER, CAMPBELL.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.435
NO, YOU'RE NOT A MONSTER.

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:04.440
AND IF I HAVE IN ANY WAY
LABELED YOU MONSTROUS

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:10.413
BY GESTURE OR MANNER,
I SINCERELY BEG YOUR PARDON.

01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:12.615
I'D LIKE TO GO
TO SLEEP NOW.

01:19:12.648 --> 01:19:14.617
I HAVE AN EARLY MORNING.

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:20.123
I WOULDN'T BOTHER SETTING
THAT ALARM, MONSTER BRONX.

01:19:20.156 --> 01:19:24.160
HE WON'T MAKE IT
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:26.562
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:32.435
HEY, I PICTURE YOU
AT IMANA'S AGE...

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:37.173
SITTING IN BED, AWAKE,
ARMS CROSSED, WHISPERING,

01:19:37.206 --> 01:19:42.245
"I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS."

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.514
WHERE WAS I WHEN YOU WERE
SIX YEARS OF AGE

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:48.317
AND ARMED AGAINST THE DARK?

01:19:48.351 --> 01:19:51.620
PROBABLY HIDING,
LIKE YOU ARE NOW.

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:53.622
IN THE JUNGLE
OR IN THE BOTTLE?

01:19:53.656 --> 01:19:57.326
TO WHICH HIDEOUT
ARE YOU REFERRING?

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.430
DOES IT MATTER?

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:04.633
IT'S NOT AS DIFFICULT
AS YOU MIGHT THINK

01:20:04.667 --> 01:20:08.304
WATCHING SOMEONE DIE.

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:13.342
AFTER 70 OR 80
MEN, WOMEN, INFANTS...

01:20:13.376 --> 01:20:18.114
YOU BEGIN TO FEEL QUITE NUMB.

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.649
WHEN I LEFT JAHAUSA'S HUT,
I WAS COMING HERE

01:20:20.683 --> 01:20:24.453
TO GET THE MAGIC SERUM.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:26.322
TO SAVE MYSELF, OF COURSE.

01:20:26.355 --> 01:20:30.059
NOT THE BOY.

01:20:30.093 --> 01:20:32.561
WHICH MAKES ME THE MONSTER.

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:36.032
YOU, AT LEAST,
WOULD SAVE THE WORLD.

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:38.467
AND THE WORLD
IS NOT ONE CHOKING BOY

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:41.237
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DISAPPEARING FOREST.

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:44.073
EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS
THAT WAY HERE IN THE DARK,

01:20:44.107 --> 01:20:49.312
AGAINST WHICH YOU ARE
SO WELL ARMED...

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:52.381
AND I HAVE ONLY THIS.

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:56.685
ENOUGH.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:58.354
GIMME THAT BOTTLE.

01:20:58.387 --> 01:20:59.588
YOU'RE NOT A MURDERER.

01:20:59.622 --> 01:21:01.557
THAT'S NOT WHY SHE LEFT YOU.

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.493
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:07.563
SHE LEFT ME...

01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:15.671
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
ALLOW HER TO FORGIVE ME.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:21.610
SHE VERY MUCH
WANTED TO DO SO.

01:21:21.644 --> 01:21:24.580
BUT I COULDN'T FORGIVE MYSELF.

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:29.118
UNTIL I DO,
NO ONE--

01:21:29.152 --> 01:21:31.254
NO ONE'S ALLOWED.

01:21:31.287 --> 01:21:33.122
DEPSWA.

01:21:33.156 --> 01:21:36.359

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:40.096
OH.

01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:44.100
WE'VE BEEN INVITED
TO A PRAYER MEETING.

01:21:44.133 --> 01:21:46.135
I'LL MAKE YOUR EXCUSES.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:57.246

01:22:13.796 --> 01:22:17.000

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:42.311
OH, HI.

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:48.251
KALANA!
KALANA!

01:24:48.284 --> 01:24:50.453
KALANA!

01:24:50.486 --> 01:24:52.588
YES, YES, HE'S OKAY.
HE'S OKAY.

01:24:52.621 --> 01:24:54.089
HE'LL BE FINE.

01:24:54.123 --> 01:24:55.424
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:57.460
WHY IS EVERYONE RUNNING?

01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:05.634
[indistinct yelling]

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:29.124
TIME'S UP.

01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:38.501
[indistinct chatter]

01:25:58.354 --> 01:26:02.057
A MIRACLE WITHOUT PROOF
IS ONLY A MIRACLE.

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:04.460
IT DO NOT STOP BULLDOZERS.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:06.729
LOOK, ORNEGA,
I INJECTED HIM MYSELF.

01:26:06.762 --> 01:26:08.331
I'M NOT DOUBTING IT.

01:26:08.364 --> 01:26:10.399
THIS BROMELIAD,
I'VE NEVER

01:26:10.433 --> 01:26:12.335
SEEN IT GROWING ANYWHERE ELSE.

01:26:12.368 --> 01:26:14.403
YOU CAN'T TRANSPLANT IT
TO THE LAB.

01:26:14.437 --> 01:26:15.638
CHRIST, I COULDN'T
BRING IT DOWN

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.473
100 FEET FROM ORIGIN.

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:19.041
NOW YOU MOVE
YOUR ROAD THROUGH HERE,

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:20.476
AND WE'VE LOST IT.

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:22.578
COME ON, ROBERTO.
IT'S NOT MY ROAD.

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:24.079
WE NEED TIME.

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:26.148
WE'RE TESTING NEW SAMPLES.

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:29.718
SENOR REYES,
HE HAS ALREADY BEEN INSTRUCTED

01:26:29.752 --> 01:26:32.388
TO MOVE THE VILLAGERS.

01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:36.525
IF A TEST IS SUCCESSFUL IN,
SAY, NEXT 24 HOURS--

01:26:36.559 --> 01:26:38.093
[whispers]
24 HOURS?

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:40.128
THE BULLDOZERS ARE RUNNING
NIGHT AND DAY NOW.

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:19.435
I'M GONNA RETEST.

01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:21.203
IT DIDN'T WORK, RAE.

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:22.738
IT'S NOT HERE.

01:27:22.771 --> 01:27:25.040
BUT YOU PROMISED ME A WEEK.

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.609
YOU GAVE ME A WEEK.

01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:30.413
PACK YOUR BAGS, RAE,
BEFORE THE ROAD GETS HERE.

01:27:30.446 --> 01:27:31.747
[chuckles]

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:33.749
YOU'RE ALWAYS THROWING ME OUT.

01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:35.984
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:40.623
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

01:27:40.656 --> 01:27:43.091
QUITE A BIT.

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:46.462
YOU DON'T SMOKE, DO YOU?

01:27:46.495 --> 01:27:49.164
THERE'S GOTTA BE A CIGARETTE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:05.614
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ME?

01:28:05.648 --> 01:28:08.150
SUPPOSED TO BE?

01:28:08.183 --> 01:28:10.986
I THINK IT'S
A VERY GOOD LIKENESS.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:15.090
TAKE IT IF YOU WANT.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:19.528
NO, I'D RATHER YOU KEPT IT.

01:28:19.562 --> 01:28:21.764
WELL, I CERTAINLY
FLATTERED YOU A BIT

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:26.168
BY IDEALIZING YOUR FOREHEAD,
BUT A MAN IN LOVE

01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:30.172
WOULDN'T NOTICE THE DISPARITY.

01:28:30.205 --> 01:28:32.140
A MAN IN LOVE?

01:28:32.174 --> 01:28:35.277
YEAH, TOMMY FALLON,
THE YOUNGER.

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:38.614
GIVE IT TO HIM.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:42.718
I'M SURE HE SEES YOUR FOREHEAD
EXACTLY AS I'VE DRAWN IT.

01:28:42.751 --> 01:28:46.188
AND HE PROBABLY NEVER NOTICED
THAT YOUR LEFT EAR

01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:48.156
IS LOWER THAN YOUR RIGHT EAR.

01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:54.196
WHEN ONE IS SMITTEN,
THOSE ARE THE DETAILS--

01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:56.665
WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING?

01:28:56.699 --> 01:28:58.233
BASELINE.

01:28:58.266 --> 01:29:00.068
WHAT ARE YOU USING?

01:29:00.102 --> 01:29:03.572
SUGAR SOLUTION.

01:29:03.606 --> 01:29:07.175
THE SAME SOLUTION
YOU'VE USED EACH TIME?

01:29:07.209 --> 01:29:09.812
NO.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:13.081
I RAN OUT.
WHY?

01:29:13.115 --> 01:29:16.118
WHERE'D YOU GET THE SUGAR?

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:42.044
WHOA!

01:29:43.245 --> 01:29:45.247
CAMPBELL!

[indistinct dialog]

01:30:30.158 --> 01:30:32.160
CAMPBELL!

01:30:34.630 --> 01:30:36.632
CAMPBELL!

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:41.704
CAMPBELL!
CAMPBELL!

01:30:46.141 --> 01:30:47.776
CAMPBELL!

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:52.014
IT'S A DAMN POOR TIME
FOR HAVING AN IRONMAN CONTEST.

01:30:52.047 --> 01:30:54.049
OW.

01:34:50.118 --> 01:34:53.321
HAVE YOU EVER
LOST ANYTHING, ORNEGA?

01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:57.492
YOUR CAR KEYS, YOUR WALLET?

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:00.228
IT WASN'T THE BROMELIADS.

01:35:00.262 --> 01:35:02.430
IT WAS THE ANTS.

01:35:02.464 --> 01:35:05.100
YOU'RE CERTAIN?

01:35:05.133 --> 01:35:08.470
I SEEM TO HAVE LEFT
THE EVIDENCE IN MY OTHER SUIT.

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.142
CAMPBELL?

01:35:39.334 --> 01:35:41.336
ROBERTO.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:47.242
ROBERTO?

01:35:50.645 --> 01:35:52.447
IT'S ME, MIGUEL.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:56.084
AH, MIGUEL.

01:35:56.118 --> 01:35:58.453
WE CAN GO
WHENEVER YOU ARE READY.

01:35:58.486 --> 01:36:00.288
NO, NO, NO.

01:36:00.322 --> 01:36:02.157
I KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR NOW.

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:04.559
IF THOSE LITTLE ORANGE BASTARDS
EXIST SOMEWHERE ELSE...

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:06.428
ROBERTO...
I'LL FIND THEM.

01:36:06.461 --> 01:36:08.296
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:10.398
IT'S TIME OUT, MY FRIEND.

01:36:10.432 --> 01:36:14.636
SIX YEARS
AND ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT.

01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:16.304
ASTON ISN'T GOING--

01:36:16.338 --> 01:36:18.240
ASTON WILL REPLACE IT,
ALL OF IT.

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:22.310
AND PROVIDE WITH A RESEARCH
ASSISTANT, PER HIS REQUEST.

01:36:22.344 --> 01:36:27.682
DR. SEALOVE, IF I REMEMBER,
WAS YOUR FIRST CHOICE.

01:36:29.651 --> 01:36:31.653
THANK YOU.

01:36:34.289 --> 01:36:36.291
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:36:41.229 --> 01:36:44.232
IF YOU ARE READY,
WE SHOULD GO.

01:36:58.146 --> 01:37:00.715
GOOD LUCK.

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:02.350
THANKS.

01:37:02.384 --> 01:37:04.386
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:12.660
YOU'LL BE IN TOUCH.

01:37:14.096 --> 01:37:17.099
[indistinct chatter]

01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:27.675
THEY WON'T RELOCATE WHERE
THE GOVERNMENT HAS INDICATED.

01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:32.180
SOONER OR LATER,
THEY'LL HAVE NO PLACE LEFT,

01:37:32.214 --> 01:37:34.649
THEN THEY'LL GO
WHERE THEY'RE TOLD.

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:39.354
HE SAYS THE MEDICINE MAN
HAS FOUND A PLACE UPRIVER.

01:37:39.387 --> 01:37:42.490
MEDICINE MAN?
YOU MEAN CAMPBELL?

01:37:42.524 --> 01:37:45.527
NO, THAT SMALL ONE OVER
BY THE TREES.

01:37:50.465 --> 01:37:52.567
GIMME A MINUTE.

01:38:37.679 --> 01:38:41.283
RIGHT.

01:38:41.316 --> 01:38:43.151
I'LL TELL HIM.

01:38:56.498 --> 01:39:00.668
HE SAID THIS WAS YOUR STICK.

01:39:00.702 --> 01:39:02.604
HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

01:39:02.637 --> 01:39:05.273
HE'S FOUND A GOOD PLACE.

01:39:05.307 --> 01:39:09.511
AND IF YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF,
YOU CAN GO WITH THEM.

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:14.382
HE SAID HE'LL TEACH YOU
BIG MAGIC.

01:39:18.353 --> 01:39:22.224
HE SAID HE'S NEVER MET
A MAN LIKE YOU BEFORE...

01:39:25.327 --> 01:39:27.695
AND MAYBE HE NEVER WILL AGAIN.

01:39:35.337 --> 01:39:40.442
I'M GONNA NEED IN ADDITION
TO A NEW CHROMATOGRAPH,

01:39:40.475 --> 01:39:43.211
MORE SCOPES, CALIPERS--

01:39:43.245 --> 01:39:46.281
I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET
EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:50.518
WHEN I REACH THE CITY,
I'LL CONTACT DR. SEALOVE.

01:39:52.387 --> 01:39:55.523
WELL, I'VE RECONSIDERED.

01:39:55.557 --> 01:39:58.560
UH, DR. SEALOVE
IS MY SECOND CHOICE NOW.

01:40:04.266 --> 01:40:05.733
OH, COME ON, BRONX.

01:40:05.767 --> 01:40:08.536
YOU THINK TOM FALLON'S GONNA
WALK DOWN THE AISLE

01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:10.305
WITH A WOMAN
WHO HAS SOMETHING BLUE

01:40:10.338 --> 01:40:15.377
AS A TATTOO
ON HER FOREHEAD, HUH?

01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:19.347
I WANT JOINT PUBLICATION.

01:40:19.381 --> 01:40:21.383
YOU CAN HAVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

01:40:26.254 --> 01:40:28.556
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.363
A MEAL AND A BATH.

01:40:40.235 --> 01:40:42.970
