I raise my glass a lot,
I know.

11:07.261 --> 11:10.178
But I raise it tonight

11:10.178 --> 11:12.387
to my amazing daughter
and her A-plus.

11:12.387 --> 11:14.303
[Jenny] Oh, boy.

11:14.303 --> 11:16.345
[doorbell rings]

11:16.345 --> 11:18.345
Who the hell's that?

11:18.345 --> 11:19.887
Sit. Eat. I got it.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.512

11:23.970 --> 11:26.387
[doorbell, banging on door

11:27.595 --> 11:29.387
What the fuck
are you doing here?

11:29.387 --> 11:31.011
You didn't fucking
call me.

11:31.011 --> 11:32.679
You can't come
to my motherfucking--

11:32.679 --> 11:33.720
Jackie.

11:34.512 --> 11:36.220
I'm pregnant.

11:36.220 --> 11:38.011
-Jackie, what's going on?
-Nothing, no, no.

11:38.011 --> 11:39.637
She's-- she's just someone
that came to me for help.

11:39.637 --> 11:41.553
-She's confused.
-He wants to kill our baby.

11:41.553 --> 11:43.887
No, no, no. Shh, shh.
Let's go. Come here. Come here.

11:43.887 --> 11:45.637
-Hon, c'mere, it's okay.
-Hey, what are you doing?

11:45.637 --> 11:47.428
No, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.

11:47.428 --> 11:48.679
No, no, she's not
coming in here.

11:48.679 --> 11:50.553
No, you can't--
She can't come--

11:50.553 --> 11:52.178
You fucking scumbag
son of a bitch.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.595
-What?
-Ma knew.

11:53.595 --> 11:55.178
She tried to warn me.
I didn't listen.

11:55.178 --> 11:57.845
How the fuck could you
bring your shit to my doorstep?!

11:57.845 --> 11:59.929
-We were just having a nice--
-Get out now!

11:59.929 --> 12:01.303
I don't have any clothes!

12:01.303 --> 12:04.762
Yeah? Then go fucking naked!

12:23.428 --> 12:26.261
FBI man Jackie Rohr.

12:26.261 --> 12:27.553
No bags?

12:27.553 --> 12:29.136
Not staying long?

12:29.136 --> 12:30.762
Not up to me at present.

12:30.762 --> 12:32.512
The usual?

12:32.512 --> 12:33.929
Sure.

12:36.762 --> 12:38.261
No. Uh...

12:38.261 --> 12:40.762
no, you know,
not tonight.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.679
No brunettes.

12:43.679 --> 12:44.970
[laughs]

12:52.845 --> 12:54.595
Do I know you?

12:54.595 --> 12:57.136
You look familiar.
Where are you from?

12:57.136 --> 12:58.970
North Shore.

12:58.970 --> 13:01.136
I could have got that
from the hoops. What part?

13:01.136 --> 13:02.679
Fuck do you care?

13:02.679 --> 13:04.387
Just thought I knew you.

13:04.387 --> 13:06.428
No, you don't.

13:06.428 --> 13:07.929
I don't talk to reporters.

13:07.929 --> 13:10.261
Well, you would be the only cop
in the city

13:10.261 --> 13:12.387
-not willing to talk to me.
-Well, maybe that's because

13:12.387 --> 13:14.637
I'm not interested in a kneeler
out beyond the fens.

13:17.679 --> 13:19.720
One broad to another here?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.261
You got yourself
a nice little job

13:21.261 --> 13:23.053
being an investigator
on this grand jury.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.887
Now, I understand why the county
and the state are involved,

13:25.887 --> 13:27.970
but what makes this
a federal case?

13:27.970 --> 13:30.053
Why is the FBI all over
some four-year-old

13:30.053 --> 13:31.637
missing person bullshit?

13:31.637 --> 13:33.428
No clue what
you're talking about.

13:33.428 --> 13:35.679
No, you know what I'm talking
about when I say Jackie Rohr?

13:38.595 --> 13:40.637
I am done with you.

13:40.637 --> 13:42.011
Look, I respect
what you're doing.

13:42.011 --> 13:43.720
Keeping your mouth shut.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.387
It's your own version
of the code of silence.

13:45.387 --> 13:47.136
But the Boston FBI
is the most corrupt

13:47.136 --> 13:49.804
law enforcement body
in the history of this country.

13:49.804 --> 13:52.970
And think, Jackie Rohr
is their John Wayne?

13:54.845 --> 13:56.470
Wait a minute.
Are you fucking him?

13:58.804 --> 14:00.804
Are you? Have you?

14:02.220 --> 14:04.679
[laughs]

14:04.679 --> 14:07.011
Oh, that's what this is, huh?

14:07.011 --> 14:08.887
Jackie would mow
over his own feet

14:08.887 --> 14:10.595
if he thought there was
something in the grass

14:10.595 --> 14:12.804
that he could trade
for something better.

14:12.804 --> 14:15.470
Get ready, Sheriff Benham,
you could be next.

14:15.470 --> 14:17.595
Aw, jeez.
[laughs]

14:17.595 --> 14:19.136
Look at that.

14:19.136 --> 14:20.845
It's fuck-you o'clock
already.

14:20.845 --> 14:22.095
[laughs]

14:22.095 --> 14:23.887
You know the president
of the Senate

14:23.887 --> 14:25.929
said the same thing to me?

14:25.929 --> 14:28.053
[whispering]
And I'm still here.

14:35.220 --> 14:39.178
That reporter bitch
Michaela Freda,

14:39.178 --> 14:41.553
she says that Jackie's gonna
derail us for his own good.

14:41.553 --> 14:43.512
Does she know something
that we don't?

14:45.970 --> 14:48.261
Now I got to sell
all my hoops.

14:48.261 --> 14:49.804
Why?

14:49.804 --> 14:51.929
Because I saw the same ones
on her.

14:51.929 --> 14:53.595
Wait, wait.

14:53.595 --> 14:55.553
Where's the inventory
from the raid?

14:55.553 --> 14:57.428
Uh...

15:04.512 --> 15:07.095
An M16, an M231.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.095
The National Guard armory
in Macon, Georgia,

15:10.095 --> 15:13.553
reported a cache of weapons
stolen this winter.

15:13.553 --> 15:15.261
M16s and M231s.

15:15.261 --> 15:17.679
Hopefully, they match the serial
numbers of what we seized.

15:17.679 --> 15:19.428
There's no AK on the list.

15:21.095 --> 15:23.136
Time to go
to the gun store.

15:23.136 --> 15:24.804

I-I can't live with it.

conversation.

Rosa, I think you and I
got off on the wrong foot.

17:52.011 --> 17:53.762
From the day we met.

17:53.762 --> 17:56.845
Well, and I take
all the blame here...

17:56.845 --> 17:59.053
I presented a grossly false
image of myself,

17:59.053 --> 18:00.720
and then I poured on the charm

18:00.720 --> 18:03.053
and I threw money around
like William Randolph Hearst.

18:03.053 --> 18:04.387
It was all bullshit.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.804
But my intentions
were honest.

18:07.804 --> 18:10.261
Honest Jackie Rohr, hmm?

18:10.261 --> 18:12.136
I was nervous. I...

18:12.136 --> 18:15.720
I was afraid that you and Joe
wouldn't give consent,

18:15.720 --> 18:17.303
and by-- by that I mean
you wouldn't bless

18:17.303 --> 18:19.470
me and Jenny
being together.

18:19.470 --> 18:21.637
You didn't have
Joe or me fooled.

18:21.637 --> 18:23.470
I know that.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.887
And that's why I'm here
to tell you that you were right.

18:26.887 --> 18:28.470
You were right all along.

18:30.387 --> 18:32.136
I'm not good enough
for your daughter.

18:33.512 --> 18:36.136
Which you prove
on a daily basis.

18:53.804 --> 18:56.011
I want to make my girl happy.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.053
I want to come home.

18:58.053 --> 19:01.136
And you could help me
do that.

19:04.053 --> 19:06.512
I want my driver's license back.

19:08.470 --> 19:09.929
I'm a fed.

19:09.929 --> 19:11.512

What can I do?

19:12.970 --> 19:15.303
I want to drive again.

19:15.303 --> 19:16.845

school bus.

19:16.845 --> 19:19.178
And I want more port.

19:21.345 --> 19:23.345
Deputy Chung, you're acting
like I'm asking

19:23.345 --> 19:25.679
for the keys
to your house here.

19:25.679 --> 19:27.929
Look, we raided a tenement
in Roxbury.

19:27.929 --> 19:30.887
We seized guns,
guns which match weapons

19:30.887 --> 19:34.095
stolen from a federal armory,
right?

19:34.095 --> 19:37.345
Now, all I want to do
is find out if my case

19:37.345 --> 19:41.220
wing-mans any ongoing operations
the ATF may possibly have

19:41.220 --> 19:43.345
that pertain to AK-47's.

19:43.345 --> 19:46.970
You know? And we can all,
you know, share the wealth.

Here's the ugly truth,

I will share

19:55.053 --> 19:57.470
with any agency
in Suffolk County.

19:57.470 --> 19:59.136
Why?

19:59.136 --> 20:01.303
There are so many fucking leaks
in Boston,

you don't even get puddles
when it rains.

20:04.053 --> 20:07.053

of my agency.

20:22.261 --> 20:25.261

FLETC down in Glynco, huh?

Now, listen,

20:39.970 --> 20:41.470
you don't want me
calling him

20:41.470 --> 20:44.261

is aiding and abetting

20:44.261 --> 20:46.261

asshole.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.470
Do you swear
there will be no leaks?

20:57.470 --> 20:58.970
Yeah.

20:58.970 --> 21:01.762
How'd you know the lead
FLETC instructor?

21:01.762 --> 21:04.762
I don't. I looked up his name
before we came.

and commands obedience.

have a job.

a good provider.

talk to him?

21:35.303 --> 21:37.345
What, me?
No, I hate the bastard.

21:37.345 --> 21:39.428
So, then why the pressure
to take him back, huh?

21:39.428 --> 21:42.762
Because you're not using
that brain of yours.

21:42.762 --> 21:45.428

and you don't see.

21:45.428 --> 21:48.387

on your brain.

21:48.387 --> 21:50.720

in a divorce?

21:50.720 --> 21:53.136
Jackie's got
the bank accounts.

21:53.136 --> 21:56.178
