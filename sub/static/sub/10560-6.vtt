01:02.776 --> 01:03.982
What?

01:17.157 --> 01:18.465
Mr. Wallensky!

01:19.459 --> 01:20.938
Mr. Wallensky!

01:28.435 --> 01:32.406
Mr. Wallensky, I just
saw the strangest thing.

01:40.147 --> 01:41.683
The housekeeper discovered the body

01:41.748 --> 01:43.284
shortly after 9:30, sir.

01:43.317 --> 01:45.194
Our initial assumption is suicide.

01:45.252 --> 01:46.788
It wasn't suicide.

01:46.820 --> 01:49.858
The rope he was suspended from is 3/4 inch.

01:49.923 --> 01:54.099
But as you can see, the
bruising is much thinner.

01:55.762 --> 01:57.366
Excellent work, Doctor.

01:57.431 --> 01:59.843
He was strangled then.

02:03.470 --> 02:05.848
That's Ivan Wallensky.

02:05.872 --> 02:07.852
You know him?

02:07.874 --> 02:12.721
Yes, I met him last year
at a battery exhibit.

02:12.779 --> 02:15.020
Mr. Wallensky had developed
a new type of battery

02:15.048 --> 02:16.823
using nickel and cadmium.

02:16.850 --> 02:18.659
Fascinating.

02:20.220 --> 02:21.824
Excuse me, Doctor.

02:25.659 --> 02:28.538
Sir, when you're ready, I think you'll find

02:28.562 --> 02:31.873
what the housekeeper has
to say quite interesting.

02:34.901 --> 02:36.744
Murdered?

02:36.803 --> 02:38.483
Do you know of anyone who may have wanted

02:38.505 --> 02:41.076
to harm Mr. Wallensky?

02:41.141 --> 02:42.916
Good Lord, no.

02:42.976 --> 02:44.717
He didn't have an enemy in the world.

02:44.745 --> 02:48.192
I mean, the man spent all
his time in his workshop.

02:50.317 --> 02:53.696
Although, yesterday, I did
see him arguing with a man

02:53.720 --> 02:55.222
just as I was leaving.

02:55.255 --> 02:56.529
What time was this?

02:56.556 --> 02:58.593
Just after supper, about 7:00.

02:58.659 --> 03:00.900
- Did you know this person?
- Um...

03:00.927 --> 03:03.373
I've never seen him before in my life.

03:03.397 --> 03:05.570
Mm.

03:05.599 --> 03:07.340
Oh, my goodness. I didn't even see that.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.074
What kind of housekeeper am I?

03:09.102 --> 03:13.949
Mrs. Chalmers, I... I'd
like to keep that, if I may.

03:14.007 --> 03:15.247
Evidence.

03:15.275 --> 03:16.913
Oh.

03:16.943 --> 03:18.945
Did Mr. Wallensky smoke?

03:19.012 --> 03:21.515
No, it must've belonged to one
of his business acquaintances.

03:21.548 --> 03:22.856
Uh...

03:22.883 --> 03:24.624
Do you recall any of their names?

03:24.685 --> 03:26.358
Um...

03:26.386 --> 03:28.195
one was called James.

03:28.221 --> 03:29.461
I don't know his last name.

03:29.523 --> 03:32.868
But he smoked cigars.

03:32.893 --> 03:34.566
That's all I know, I'm afraid.

03:34.594 --> 03:36.540
Mrs. Chalmers,

03:36.563 --> 03:38.907
tell the detective about the spaceship.

03:42.602 --> 03:45.139
More of a bright light
flying above the road.

03:45.205 --> 03:47.310
It came at me faster than a speeding train.

03:47.374 --> 03:49.149
I don't know what it was,

03:49.209 --> 03:51.746
but I am certain it was not of this world.

04:01.955 --> 04:03.992
Sir, I spoke to some of the neighbors.

04:04.057 --> 04:06.970
A Bert Hawksworth up on Concession Five

04:06.993 --> 04:08.734
says he saw bright lights

04:08.762 --> 04:10.503
moving through the fields last night.

04:10.564 --> 04:13.477
He thought they looked extraterrestrial.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.740
His words, sir.

04:14.768 --> 04:16.247
So it's your feeling

04:16.269 --> 04:17.976
that this is the work of Martians, George?

04:18.004 --> 04:19.312
No, no, no, sir.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.012
Venusians.

04:21.074 --> 04:23.987
Venusians, sir, have a motive for invasion.

04:25.345 --> 04:26.983
And what would that motive be?

04:27.013 --> 04:29.619
Well, sir, Venus is permanently beclouded.

04:29.649 --> 04:31.151
Clearly, they have somehow managed

04:31.184 --> 04:32.492
to sully their own atmosphere

04:32.519 --> 04:34.294
and now covet our clear blue skies,

04:34.321 --> 04:36.824
such as they are.

04:36.857 --> 04:39.463
Now, George, why go to the trouble

04:39.493 --> 04:41.097
of killing Ivan Wallensky

04:41.128 --> 04:43.005
and faking his suicide

04:43.029 --> 04:48.308
when they could easily
dispatch him with a death ray?

04:48.335 --> 04:50.679
Yes, death rays, well, that's a good ques... 

04:50.704 --> 04:52.479
Sir, are you mocking me?

04:54.708 --> 04:56.119
No, George.

04:56.143 --> 04:58.145
It's just that your spaceship has left

04:58.178 --> 05:00.715
some decidedly terrestrial tracks.

05:00.781 --> 05:02.192
It rained here last night, George,

05:02.215 --> 05:04.217
and we need to find out
at exactly what time.

05:04.284 --> 05:05.820
Come on.

05:08.622 --> 05:09.828
Whoa.

05:09.856 --> 05:11.130
Mavis!

05:15.328 --> 05:17.399
Alexander.

05:17.464 --> 05:19.034
Alexander, this is Detective Murdoch.

05:19.065 --> 05:20.738
He's investigating your father's death.

05:20.801 --> 05:22.075
Mr. Wallensky,

05:22.135 --> 05:23.842
I'm terribly sorry for your loss.

05:23.870 --> 05:25.975
Thank you, Detective.

05:26.006 --> 05:27.417
Do you know of anyone

05:27.474 --> 05:30.717
who may have wanted your father dead?

05:30.744 --> 05:33.554
No. He was completely harmless.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.924
A little lacking in the
social skills, perhaps.

05:35.982 --> 05:38.428
The only thing he cared
about were his batteries.

05:40.153 --> 05:41.860
Perhaps money was a motive?

05:41.888 --> 05:43.333
Money?

05:43.356 --> 05:45.029
Your father was an important inventor.

05:45.058 --> 05:47.197
He held a number of
patents, as I understand.

05:47.227 --> 05:49.207
None of which were worth a dime.

05:49.229 --> 05:52.210
And any money he did
make went into his work.

05:52.232 --> 05:55.577
We lived in poverty here, as you can see.

05:55.602 --> 05:58.879
Well, surely his battery ideas...

05:58.905 --> 06:02.182
there must have been some
commercial potential there.

06:02.209 --> 06:03.745
I don't know anything about that.

06:03.777 --> 06:05.882
I was never involved in my father's work,

06:05.912 --> 06:08.552
much to his disappointment.

06:08.582 --> 06:09.890
I'm sorry.

06:09.916 --> 06:13.625
I... I wish I could be of more help.

06:13.687 --> 06:15.792
It's quite all right, Mr. Wallensky.

06:15.856 --> 06:17.767
If you think of anything else,

06:17.791 --> 06:21.705
please don't hesitate to contact me.

06:21.728 --> 06:23.969
I will. Thank you.

06:37.978 --> 06:40.288
Sir, it's mostly diagrams and equations.

06:40.313 --> 06:41.917
Don't worry about those, George.

06:41.948 --> 06:43.586
I'm more interested in Ivan's letters... 

06:43.617 --> 06:45.096
who was writing to him,

06:45.118 --> 06:46.995
what was the nature of the correspondence.

06:47.053 --> 06:49.431
You think the killer may have written him?

06:49.456 --> 06:51.163
Murder is usually a last resort.

06:51.224 --> 06:53.397
If the killer had a
problem with Mr. Wallensky,

06:53.426 --> 06:55.167
chances are it was communicated to him.

06:55.228 --> 06:56.639
Murdoch.

06:56.663 --> 06:57.937
A word.

07:02.736 --> 07:04.272
Progress on the case?

07:04.304 --> 07:06.011
Not much so far, sir.

07:06.072 --> 07:08.279
Constable Higgins is taking finger marks,

07:08.308 --> 07:10.345
Constable Crabtree is looking into motive,

07:10.410 --> 07:12.481
and I'll be checking with Dr. Grace shortly

07:12.512 --> 07:15.186
to see if she's
established a time of death.

07:15.248 --> 07:16.750
Good, good.

07:16.783 --> 07:18.421
Sounds like you have this well in hand.

07:21.821 --> 07:23.198
Is there anything else, sir?

07:23.256 --> 07:25.031
No.

07:25.091 --> 07:27.162
Yes.

07:27.193 --> 07:28.968
Bloody hell, Murdoch.

07:28.995 --> 07:30.633
It's Margaret.

07:30.664 --> 07:32.302
Your wife.

07:32.332 --> 07:33.675
Shut the door.

07:35.502 --> 07:37.277
She's been going out every Tuesday

07:37.304 --> 07:39.614
for the past few weeks.

07:39.639 --> 07:41.710
She's been going to visit Alex Boddings.

07:41.775 --> 07:44.016
Oh, her consumptive friend.

07:44.044 --> 07:46.183
Taken a turn for the worse, apparently.

07:46.212 --> 07:47.452
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.686
Well, don't be.

07:48.715 --> 07:50.490
It's a lie.

07:50.517 --> 07:52.190
I bumped into her husband.

07:52.218 --> 07:54.892
Alex Boddings has been at
a retreat in Niagara Falls

07:54.955 --> 07:56.400
for the past two weeks.

07:56.456 --> 07:57.992
She's doing just fine.

07:58.024 --> 07:59.901
Oh.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.702
"Oh," indeed.

08:02.729 --> 08:06.871
Oh, it's all my fault, Murdoch.

08:06.900 --> 08:09.676
Margaret saw me kiss Rosa
Hamilton the other week.

08:09.703 --> 08:11.376
What, the opera diva, sir?

08:11.404 --> 08:13.406
I thought she kissed you.

08:13.473 --> 08:14.747
And I kissed her right back.

08:14.808 --> 08:16.310
There's no point in denying it.

08:17.577 --> 08:18.817
Margaret and I, we just... 

08:20.347 --> 08:23.658
we just don't have that passion anymore.

08:23.683 --> 08:25.754
I suppose that happens in a marriage.

08:25.819 --> 08:27.594
There's nothing you can do about it.

08:32.692 --> 08:37.539
Sir, perhaps I could suggest
a private investigator

08:37.563 --> 08:39.874
if only to allay your suspicions.

08:39.899 --> 08:42.674
I don't want to do that, Murdoch.

08:42.702 --> 08:45.239
It's so tawdry.

08:45.271 --> 08:48.912
Well, sir, I'm sure
it's not what you think.

08:48.942 --> 08:51.218
I took two rectal thermometer readings

08:51.244 --> 08:53.224
spaced half an hour apart

08:53.246 --> 08:56.056
and found that the rate
of cooling in Ivan's corpse

08:56.082 --> 08:58.062
was in accordance with
what would be predicted

08:58.084 --> 09:00.530
by the glacier equation.

09:00.553 --> 09:02.260
I then determined the amount of digestion

09:02.288 --> 09:03.596
from his last meal,

09:03.623 --> 09:05.193
which, according to the housekeeper,

09:05.225 --> 09:07.762
was consumed between 5:10 and 5:20.

09:07.794 --> 09:09.432
Comparing the two estimates-

09:09.462 --> 09:12.306
Doctor, I'm sure your
methodology is quite sound,

09:12.365 --> 09:14.868
but all I require is the time of death.

09:14.901 --> 09:17.313
What I'm trying to tell
you is that both methods,

09:17.370 --> 09:20.579
digestion and algor mortis, agree exactly.

09:20.607 --> 09:22.450
And?

09:22.475 --> 09:25.115
Assuming a ten-degree
ambient temperature drop

09:25.145 --> 09:27.125
from the time of death
to when I first arrived,

09:27.147 --> 09:29.457
I am confident in asserting
that the death occurred

09:29.482 --> 09:31.894
between 7:30 and 8:00.

09:33.203 --> 09:34.910
Very good. Thank you, Doctor.

09:36.873 --> 09:38.216
Sir.

09:38.241 --> 09:40.084
I spoke to Mr. Wallensky's neighbors.

09:40.110 --> 09:41.612
Apparently, it rained between 7:00

09:41.678 --> 09:43.385
and quarter past last evening.

09:43.413 --> 09:45.053
So the tire tracks were made after that.

09:45.081 --> 09:46.458
Also, I've gone through

09:46.516 --> 09:48.086
all of Mr. Wallensky's correspondences

09:48.118 --> 09:49.358
for the last year.

09:49.386 --> 09:50.729
And?

09:50.754 --> 09:52.234
Well, there were a couple of letters

09:52.255 --> 09:53.632
from a Henry Lord in Detroit,

09:53.690 --> 09:55.294
the first of which was gracious enough.

09:55.358 --> 09:57.395
The last was somewhat threatening.

09:57.427 --> 09:59.532
"Dear Ivan, I will be in Toronto next week.

09:59.562 --> 10:01.564
I urge you to accept my offer.

10:01.598 --> 10:05.637
I fear you will regret the alternative."

10:05.702 --> 10:07.204
Then in another correspondence,

10:07.237 --> 10:09.217
it seems there was a dispute over a patent

10:09.239 --> 10:10.809
for one of Ivan's batteries.

10:10.874 --> 10:12.285
Who was the dispute with?

10:12.308 --> 10:14.982
A numbered company located in Willowdale.

10:15.045 --> 10:17.889
Coincidentally, the same
address has another correspondent

10:17.914 --> 10:20.053
who simply went by "James."

10:20.083 --> 10:22.290
Hmm, perhaps the smoker of this cigar.

10:22.318 --> 10:23.592
Mm.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.224
"Ivan, your stubbornness and greed

10:25.255 --> 10:27.326
are destroying everything
we've worked for.

10:27.390 --> 10:28.951
I will not let you pull this house down

10:28.958 --> 10:32.428
on both our heads."

10:32.462 --> 10:37.502
George, let's take a
little trip to Willowdale.

10:47.343 --> 10:49.846
Looks like somebody doesn't
want us snooping around, sir.

10:49.913 --> 10:53.861
It certainly does, doesn't it, George?

11:05.495 --> 11:06.701
Whoa!

11:09.499 --> 11:12.776
- All set?
- Sir.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.282
Sir, can I tell you
something in confidence?

11:15.305 --> 11:16.648
Of course, George.

11:16.673 --> 11:18.050
Now, it can't get back to the person

11:18.108 --> 11:19.985
to which this pertains that I told you.

11:20.009 --> 11:22.546
Well, yes, I believe that's
what "in confidence" means.

11:22.612 --> 11:24.319
Oh. Yes, of course.

11:24.347 --> 11:28.523
Well, sir, a certain somebody
has asked me to engage

11:28.551 --> 11:32.055
in a sort of act of espionage.

11:32.122 --> 11:33.965
Would this certain
somebody be the inspector

11:33.990 --> 11:35.196
at Station Number 4, George?

11:35.225 --> 11:36.533
- Yes, sir.
- Mm.

11:36.559 --> 11:38.232
And did the inspector ask you

11:38.294 --> 11:40.831
to surreptitiously look in
on his wife this evening?

11:40.864 --> 11:42.844
Yes, sir.

11:42.866 --> 11:44.573
I don't see a problem with that, George.

11:44.634 --> 11:46.705
Well, sir, except...

11:46.736 --> 11:48.647
what if she's being unfaithful to him?

11:48.671 --> 11:50.207
I mean, I'm not saying that she would,

11:50.240 --> 11:51.913
but she could.

11:51.975 --> 11:53.181
Right.

11:53.209 --> 11:54.711
Come to me first.

11:54.744 --> 11:56.382
I'm aware of the inspector's concerns,

11:56.412 --> 11:59.154
and I'll deliver the bad news if need be.

11:59.182 --> 12:00.388
Well, yes, I will.

12:01.718 --> 12:03.026
Stop right there!

12:03.052 --> 12:04.258
Get off the road.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.526
Identify yourself, please.

12:05.555 --> 12:06.863
Get off the road now!

12:06.890 --> 12:09.336
I don't think you understand.

12:09.359 --> 12:10.565
Sir, look out!

12:17.667 --> 12:19.271
James Pendrick.

12:19.335 --> 12:20.905
Detective Murdoch.

12:20.937 --> 12:22.507
We meet again.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.297
I knew our paths would cross again.

12:30.330 --> 12:33.800
Detective, this is Douglas Meadows.

12:33.833 --> 12:37.440
Mr. Pendrick, your vehicle has a lamp.

12:37.470 --> 12:38.813
Indeed it does.

12:38.838 --> 12:41.819
500 watts.

12:41.841 --> 12:43.821
Did this vehicle happen to be at the home

12:43.843 --> 12:46.790
of Ivan Wallensky last night?

12:46.813 --> 12:49.259
Yes, it was. Why?

12:49.282 --> 12:50.784
Around what time?

12:50.817 --> 12:53.855
9:30 or thereabouts.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.696
And what was the purpose of your visit?

12:56.756 --> 12:58.667
It was personal.

12:58.691 --> 13:00.500
What's going on here, Detective?

13:00.526 --> 13:03.439
Ivan Wallensky was found
murdered in his home

13:03.463 --> 13:05.170
shortly before 10:00 last night.

13:05.198 --> 13:06.506
Ivan.

13:06.532 --> 13:07.772
Oh, God, that's terrible.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.006
Douglas.

13:09.035 --> 13:10.605
I can't believe it.

13:10.637 --> 13:14.710
What was the nature of your relationship?

13:14.774 --> 13:17.516
We were partners in a business venture.

13:17.543 --> 13:19.454
I'm sorry, Detective.

13:19.479 --> 13:22.153
It was Ivan's battery that made
the Pendrick Bullet possible.

13:22.181 --> 13:24.354
- Without him...  The Pendrick Bullet.

13:24.384 --> 13:28.332
Yeah, the name of this vehicle.

13:28.354 --> 13:30.857
I appreciate your loss, Mr. Pendrick,

13:30.890 --> 13:33.564
but I'm trying to reconcile that

13:33.626 --> 13:38.006
with the tone of your latest
letter to Mr. Wallensky.

13:39.699 --> 13:41.007
It's true.

13:41.034 --> 13:43.071
We had a falling-out.

13:43.136 --> 13:44.342
It was my fault.

13:44.370 --> 13:47.351
I wounded his pride.

13:47.373 --> 13:48.977
That's why I was at his house last night.

13:49.008 --> 13:51.181
I was attempting to make amends.

13:51.210 --> 13:52.689
Did you speak with him?

13:52.712 --> 13:54.919
No. He wouldn't come to the door.

13:54.981 --> 13:58.019
This was at about 9:30.

13:58.051 --> 14:00.588
Where were you between 7:30 and 8:00 then?

14:00.653 --> 14:03.099
I was hosting a dinner
for potential investors.

14:03.156 --> 14:06.763
Douglas can vouch for that. He was there.

14:06.826 --> 14:08.737
Very well.

14:11.664 --> 14:16.010
This is your latest venture, I take it.

14:16.035 --> 14:19.676
I can see you're impressed.

14:19.706 --> 14:23.415
Prepare to be astounded.

14:23.443 --> 14:25.116
Get in.

14:28.614 --> 14:32.357
You know you want to, Detective.

14:32.385 --> 14:34.296
George, meet me back at the station.

14:34.354 --> 14:35.594
Yes, sir.

14:44.897 --> 14:46.877
Your acceleration pedal is on the left.

14:46.899 --> 14:48.242
Your brake is on the right.

14:48.267 --> 14:49.610
This is your velocity gauge.

14:49.635 --> 14:51.740
Do not exceed 40 miles per hour

14:51.771 --> 14:54.149
until you hit the asphalt.

14:54.207 --> 14:56.244
This will go 40 miles an hour?

14:56.275 --> 14:58.653
Put your left foot down and see.

15:58.137 --> 15:59.878
Welcome to Pendrick Headquarters.

16:05.178 --> 16:07.658
I had it up to 55 miles per hour!

16:07.680 --> 16:10.183
It's been clocked at 62.

16:10.216 --> 16:11.559
Ho!

16:11.617 --> 16:13.358
What's this?

16:13.386 --> 16:14.626
Photovoltaic cells.

16:14.654 --> 16:16.031
We own the patent for that as well.

16:16.055 --> 16:17.693
Ultimately, we want the Pendrick Bullet

16:17.723 --> 16:18.963
to run on solar power.

16:18.991 --> 16:20.616
I foresee a time when... 

16:22.630 --> 16:23.458
Solar power.

16:23.528 --> 16:25.673
Yeah, there'll be a time when
you'll see cells like this

16:25.698 --> 16:27.143
on the roof of every house.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.077
Free energy.

16:29.185 --> 16:31.927
It's a wonderful future we have before us.

16:31.954 --> 16:33.228
Yes.

16:36.192 --> 16:38.433
This is what makes the
Pendrick Bullet possible.

16:40.907 --> 16:43.012
Oh. Ivan Wallensky's battery.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.283
Yes.

16:44.344 --> 16:45.584
Poor Ivan.

16:45.612 --> 16:47.717
The man was a genius.

16:47.747 --> 16:51.593
It's lightweight, powerful,
and completely interchangeable.

16:51.618 --> 16:53.962
So while one set of batteries is in use,

16:54.020 --> 16:55.294
the other can be... 

16:55.355 --> 16:56.561
Charged. Exactly.

16:56.589 --> 16:58.125
They connect in a series

16:58.191 --> 17:00.228
so that each battery is
small enough to be removed,

17:00.260 --> 17:01.967
even by a woman.

17:02.028 --> 17:03.735
When we take the company public,

17:03.763 --> 17:06.209
we hope to produce vehicles
for the single driver,

17:06.232 --> 17:07.643
the couple, and the family.

17:07.701 --> 17:09.146
For long-distance travel,

17:09.202 --> 17:10.806
batteries could be exchanged or charged

17:10.869 --> 17:12.281
at roadside service stations

17:12.305 --> 17:14.944
which will double as hotels and eateries.

17:14.973 --> 17:17.386
Well, you appear to have
thought of everything.

17:17.410 --> 17:19.720
It's only the beginning, Murdoch.

17:19.746 --> 17:22.920
The Pendrick Bullet will
change the face of the nation.

17:22.949 --> 17:24.587
With limitless transportation,

17:24.617 --> 17:26.926
people will no longer be
confined to downtown squalor.

17:26.953 --> 17:29.627
Every man will own a
house and a piece of land.

17:29.656 --> 17:32.136
Cities will be connected
both internally and externally

17:32.158 --> 17:37.130
by vast highways as wide
as the Champs-Elysées.

17:37.163 --> 17:39.074
Cigar?

17:39.099 --> 17:41.340
Has he been bending your ear
on his vision of the future?

17:41.401 --> 17:43.608
It all sounds fascinating.

17:43.636 --> 17:45.274
Well, we're not there yet.

17:45.305 --> 17:47.148
Much still needs to be done.

17:47.173 --> 17:49.779
We hope to make a public
stock offering next week.

17:49.809 --> 17:52.085
At which point we should
have the capital necessary

17:52.112 --> 17:54.319
to begin mass-producing these vehicles.

17:54.347 --> 17:56.827
We're in a race with the
internal combustion engine.

17:56.850 --> 17:59.126
Whoever gets there first
will dominate the market.

17:59.152 --> 18:01.792
In fact, if you're
looking for Ivan's killer,

18:01.821 --> 18:04.028
you might start with our competitors.

18:04.090 --> 18:06.434
One of them is in Toronto at this moment.

18:06.459 --> 18:08.200
There you are.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.502
He's here to compete against
me in the Pendrick Challenge.

18:10.530 --> 18:13.340
The Pendrick Challenge? What's that?

18:13.366 --> 18:15.471
It's a road race I'm sponsoring.

18:15.502 --> 18:18.813
The internal combustion engine
against the Pendrick Bullet.

18:18.838 --> 18:20.146
Mm.

18:20.173 --> 18:23.017
And who's your competitor?

18:23.042 --> 18:24.715
Henry Ford.

18:26.045 --> 18:27.353
Oh, I apologize, sir.

18:27.380 --> 18:29.189
It really did look like "Henry Lord."

18:29.215 --> 18:30.558
That's quite all right, George.

18:30.617 --> 18:31.823
I'm sure it's the same man.

18:31.851 --> 18:33.057
Let's bring him in.

18:33.119 --> 18:34.826
Well, I can't right now, sir.

18:34.854 --> 18:37.130
I have to attend to my off-duty
duties for the inspector.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.727
Oh, yes, of course.

18:38.792 --> 18:41.398
Well, before you go, ring Mr. Ford's hotel

18:41.461 --> 18:43.463
and request his presence for an interview.

18:43.496 --> 18:45.567
- Sir.
- Thank you.

18:45.632 --> 18:47.737
Mr. Wallensky. How can I help you?

18:47.801 --> 18:51.010
I know who killed my father.

18:51.037 --> 18:53.916
I've just come from a visit
to Sam Roland's office.

18:53.973 --> 18:55.475
- Who is?
- My father's lawyer.

18:55.508 --> 18:56.885
I wanted to inform him of his death

18:56.910 --> 18:58.253
and to arrange matters of estate.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.551
Of course.

18:59.579 --> 19:01.559
Mr. Roland informed me that my father

19:01.581 --> 19:03.720
had just filed a lawsuit against a company

19:03.750 --> 19:05.024
owned by a James Pendrick.

19:05.051 --> 19:06.325
Have you heard of him?

19:06.352 --> 19:07.695
Yes, I have.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.393
Well, apparently, this man Pendrick

19:09.422 --> 19:11.527
was about to make something
called a public offering.

19:11.558 --> 19:12.866
Do you know what that is?

19:12.892 --> 19:14.371
When a company needs to raise money

19:14.394 --> 19:15.896
and sells a portion of its shares

19:15.929 --> 19:17.670
directly to the public.

19:17.697 --> 19:19.870
Yes, and apparently this
whole public offering thing

19:19.899 --> 19:21.173
had been planned for months.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.545
I would imagine, yes.

19:23.570 --> 19:26.779
According to Mr. Roland,
my father's lawsuit

19:26.840 --> 19:29.081
would have stopped it in its tracks.

19:30.844 --> 19:32.790
And now that he's dead,

19:32.846 --> 19:34.519
the lawsuit is dropped,

19:34.547 --> 19:37.255
and the initial public
offering goes ahead as planned.

19:37.283 --> 19:40.628
Detective, I think this Pendrick fellow

19:40.687 --> 19:43.099
may have killed my father.

19:45.725 --> 19:47.363
I ask you once again, Mr. Pendrick,

19:47.393 --> 19:49.066
what was the nature of your disagreement

19:49.095 --> 19:51.371
with Mr. Wallensky?

19:51.397 --> 19:52.705
I already told you.

19:52.732 --> 19:54.473
I wounded his pride.

19:54.534 --> 19:56.241
How so?

19:56.269 --> 19:58.875
Ivan got it into his head
that he'd been cheated.

19:58.905 --> 20:00.942
So that's when he launched his lawsuit.

20:00.974 --> 20:03.045
Groundless, of course.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.885
Nothing more than legal blackmail.

20:04.911 --> 20:06.754
That's why I went to his
house the other night,

20:06.779 --> 20:09.953
because I-l was willing
to agree to his terms.

20:09.983 --> 20:12.259
Or did it occur to you
that it would be cheaper

20:12.285 --> 20:13.821
to simply kill him?

20:17.490 --> 20:20.232
What is it about me that
offends you, Murdoch?

20:20.260 --> 20:21.466
Mr. Pendrick... 

20:21.494 --> 20:22.939
Every time we meet,

20:22.962 --> 20:24.600
you accuse me of the most heinous crimes.

20:24.631 --> 20:28.272
Every time, your own
investigations absolve me.

20:28.301 --> 20:30.281
We should be friends, you and I.

20:30.303 --> 20:31.646
We're men of science,

20:31.671 --> 20:33.014
men of vision.

20:33.072 --> 20:35.484
And yet I sit here once again

20:35.508 --> 20:37.988
under your accusing stare.

20:38.011 --> 20:39.991
What will it take, Murdoch,

20:40.013 --> 20:43.517
to convince you once and for all
I'm not a cold-blooded killer?

20:43.583 --> 20:46.325
A persuasive alibi would be a good start.

20:46.352 --> 20:48.423
I already told you.

20:48.454 --> 20:50.092
One that isn't being corroborated

20:50.123 --> 20:51.693
by a suspected accomplice.

20:51.758 --> 20:55.171
Now I'm being accused?

20:55.194 --> 20:58.607
I was hosting a dinner
for over 100 investors,

20:58.631 --> 21:00.440
many of whom will be at
the Pendrick Challenge

21:00.466 --> 21:02.002
tomorrow afternoon.

21:02.035 --> 21:05.505
Will 100 corroborations be enough?

21:14.847 --> 21:17.225
Thank you, Constable.

21:17.283 --> 21:20.389
Mrs. Chalmers, thank you for
coming on such short notice.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.330
Do you recognize either of these men?

21:24.123 --> 21:25.898
The one on the left is that James fellow

21:25.959 --> 21:27.563
I told you about.

21:27.627 --> 21:29.971
Is either one of them
the man you saw arguing

21:29.996 --> 21:31.202
with Mr. Wallensky?

21:31.230 --> 21:32.470
No. I'm afraid not.

21:33.733 --> 21:35.178
Are you quite sure?

21:35.201 --> 21:37.044
Yes.

21:37.070 --> 21:40.505
He was the same age thereabouts,
but it's neither of them.

21:56.322 --> 21:59.895
I'm here to see a Detective Murdoch.

21:59.926 --> 22:01.667
That's him.

22:01.694 --> 22:04.334
That's the man I saw
arguing with Mr. Wallensky.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.839
Hello, Detective.

22:09.869 --> 22:11.780
I'm Henry Ford.

22:16.009 --> 22:18.683
Yes, I was at Mr.
Wallensky's farm yesterday.

22:18.711 --> 22:21.851
And what was the nature of your visit?

22:21.881 --> 22:25.351
I was trying to convince
him to join my company.

22:25.385 --> 22:28.298
According to his housekeeper,
the two of you were arguing.

22:28.354 --> 22:31.597
Ivan took umbrage at my suggestion

22:31.624 --> 22:34.070
that his shares in Pendrick's
company were worthless.

22:34.093 --> 22:35.629
Worthless?

22:35.695 --> 22:38.073
I told him that the
electric car had no future.

22:38.097 --> 22:39.440
I told him that his patent

22:39.465 --> 22:40.967
would be wasted in Pendrick's company

22:41.034 --> 22:42.445
and that he should bring his battery

22:42.468 --> 22:43.776
and come and work for me.

22:43.803 --> 22:45.874
Mr. Ford,

22:45.905 --> 22:48.545
why would a car that uses a gasoline engine

22:48.574 --> 22:50.212
need a battery?

22:50.243 --> 22:53.122
At present, the engine
needs to be hand-cranked.

22:53.146 --> 22:55.786
It's a problem, especially
for the weaker sex.

22:55.815 --> 22:57.658
Wallensky's battery was just what I needed

22:57.717 --> 23:00.220
for an electrical ignition.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.096
So it's just a coincidence then

23:02.121 --> 23:03.725
that by depriving Mr. Pendrick

23:03.756 --> 23:06.259
of Mr. Wallensky and his battery,

23:06.292 --> 23:08.966
you would also be crushing
your main competitor?

23:13.166 --> 23:15.112
I'm an engineer, Detective.

23:15.134 --> 23:17.444
I build cars.

23:17.470 --> 23:19.190
If I thought the electric
car were superior,

23:19.238 --> 23:20.979
I would build electric cars.

23:21.007 --> 23:25.285
But the fact is, the
gasoline engine is superior.

23:25.311 --> 23:27.917
I've driven Mr. Pendrick's bullet.

23:27.947 --> 23:29.517
It was very impressive.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.084
I've no doubt of that.

23:31.117 --> 23:32.790
I'm sure it's lightweight, streamlined?

23:32.819 --> 23:35.459
- Yes, very much so.
- It has to be.

23:35.488 --> 23:38.492
But the gasoline-powered
car, on the other hand,

23:38.524 --> 23:40.765
can weigh a ton and look like an egg crate,

23:40.793 --> 23:42.136
but it can be driven 1,000 miles,

23:42.161 --> 23:43.697
because all it takes to keep it going

23:43.763 --> 23:45.765
is another tank of gasoline,

23:45.798 --> 23:48.369
and gas is cheap, always will be.

23:48.434 --> 23:51.506
There's an ocean of oil
under the Texan desert.

23:53.473 --> 23:56.283
Does this Henry Ford
fellow look good for it?

23:56.309 --> 23:59.188
I'm not convinced he has a
strong enough motive, sir.

23:59.212 --> 24:02.125
Find out who stands to gain,
and you'll find your killer.

24:02.148 --> 24:03.650
What do I always say, Murdoch?

24:03.683 --> 24:04.889
Follow the money.

24:04.951 --> 24:06.157
Exactly.

24:06.185 --> 24:09.361
Sir.

24:09.388 --> 24:10.662
Right.

24:10.690 --> 24:12.226
Crabtree, in my office.

24:12.291 --> 24:13.702
Uh...

24:21.000 --> 24:24.174
Well, Crabtree,

24:24.203 --> 24:25.546
give it to me straight.

24:29.142 --> 24:32.851
Is my wife seeing someone?

24:32.879 --> 24:35.359
Sir, I'm afraid it
could be worse than that.

24:35.381 --> 24:37.258
Worse?

24:37.316 --> 24:40.092
Sir, I think Mrs. Brackenreid-

24:40.153 --> 24:43.760
I think your wife is seeing a gigolo.

24:43.823 --> 24:45.029
A what?

24:45.057 --> 24:46.331
A gigolo, sir!

24:46.359 --> 24:47.861
A man who is paid to have... 

24:47.894 --> 24:50.932
I know what a bloody gigolo is, Crabtree!

24:50.997 --> 24:52.840
What exactly did you see?

24:52.865 --> 24:54.867
Well, sir...

24:54.901 --> 24:58.280
your wife arrived at
the house of another man,

24:58.337 --> 25:01.443
and she gave him money and went inside.

25:01.507 --> 25:03.783
And moments later, another woman showed up,

25:03.843 --> 25:05.720
and she did the same thing.

25:05.745 --> 25:07.725
Your wife hadn't even left yet.

25:07.747 --> 25:09.454
She's not seeing a gigolo.

25:09.515 --> 25:11.927
Well... well, what then?

25:11.951 --> 25:14.761
One... one of her charity things probably.

25:14.787 --> 25:17.563
Well... well, why lie about it then?

25:17.590 --> 25:18.864
Why, indeed?

25:21.694 --> 25:22.968
Bloody hell.

25:24.764 --> 25:26.471
It's a gambling den.

25:26.532 --> 25:27.772
She's bloody gambling.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.412
Well, then, I suppose
that's a good thing, sir,

25:31.437 --> 25:32.916
relatively speaking.

25:32.939 --> 25:34.577
I mean, at least she's
not paying a man to...

25:34.607 --> 25:37.247
Yes, yes, yes, Crabtree.

25:37.276 --> 25:39.586
She gave me such a hard
time about my drinking...

25:39.612 --> 25:41.558
Temperance League preaching and all that... 

25:41.581 --> 25:44.323
and here she is sneaking
around and breaking the law.

25:44.383 --> 25:45.953
Mm.

25:45.985 --> 25:47.430
Crabtree,

25:47.453 --> 25:50.059
take two constables and arrest them.

25:50.089 --> 25:52.126
- Sir?
- The lot of them.

25:52.158 --> 25:53.796
What, even your wife?

25:53.826 --> 25:56.306
Especially the wife.

26:00.499 --> 26:02.501
So what's all this?

26:02.568 --> 26:05.981
Ah, sir, I've been looking
into James Pendrick's company.

26:06.005 --> 26:08.611
Pendrick has been working
on his electric carriage

26:08.641 --> 26:10.279
for the past two years.

26:10.309 --> 26:13.421
He found out about Wallensky's
battery back in the fall

26:13.446 --> 26:15.016
and offered him a stake in the company

26:15.081 --> 26:16.651
in exchange for the patent.

26:16.682 --> 26:17.990
But he still needed capital

26:18.017 --> 26:20.156
to develop and build the prototype,

26:20.186 --> 26:22.689
and that's where Douglas Meadows comes in.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.496
Meadows found four private investors

26:24.523 --> 26:26.434
to put in $20,000 each.

26:26.459 --> 26:27.995
That gave him the capital necessary

26:28.027 --> 26:29.768
to build the prototype.

26:29.795 --> 26:32.469
Pendrick now wants to
take his company public

26:32.498 --> 26:35.104
in hopes that he will be
able to raise enough capital

26:35.134 --> 26:37.705
to build and sell the vehicles en masse.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.807
How much are they hoping to raise?

26:39.839 --> 26:43.678
$1 million.

26:43.709 --> 26:45.655
There's a lot of money
riding on this, Murdoch.

26:45.678 --> 26:47.385
It is, indeed.

26:47.446 --> 26:50.290
And Pendrick has gone into
considerable personal debt

26:50.316 --> 26:51.818
to finance this launch, sir.

26:51.851 --> 26:54.354
He's invited 100 potential investors

26:54.387 --> 26:57.163
from all over the continent,
wined and dined them,

26:57.189 --> 26:59.362
and put them all up at the Queen's Hotel.

26:59.392 --> 27:02.498
So if this public offering
didn't go off on schedule...

27:02.528 --> 27:05.202
Pendrick would be ruined.

27:05.231 --> 27:07.973
Hard to find a stronger motive
than that for killing someone.

27:11.504 --> 27:12.915
Oh, excuse me, Murdoch.

27:16.208 --> 27:17.710
There's no need to be upset.

27:17.743 --> 27:19.723
The inspector just wants to have a word.

27:19.745 --> 27:23.818
So, ladies, I understand
you've been gambling.

27:23.849 --> 27:25.760
I can see that some of you

27:25.818 --> 27:28.196
are members of the Temperance League.

27:28.220 --> 27:29.995
Yet here you are

27:30.022 --> 27:32.161
on the wrong side of the law.

27:32.191 --> 27:34.535
I've half a mind to lock
you all up for the night.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.507
Oh, Thomas, stop this nonsense right now.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.942
In this station, you refer to
me as Inspector Brackenreid.

27:41.267 --> 27:42.871
Crabtree, release them,

27:42.902 --> 27:44.245
except you.

27:45.905 --> 27:47.578
Follow me, Mrs. Brackenreid.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.253
This is absurd.

27:51.277 --> 27:52.915
We were playing a simple game of lotto.

27:52.945 --> 27:55.391
It's fun. There's nothing wrong with it.

27:55.414 --> 27:58.858
Nothing wrong with it?

27:58.884 --> 28:01.364
We've been eating potato
and beans for the last month.

28:01.387 --> 28:03.526
A man needs meat, damn it, red meat!

28:03.556 --> 28:05.058
Well, if that's your concern,

28:05.091 --> 28:06.764
you can have all the meat you want now.

28:06.792 --> 28:08.897
- How's that?
- I won.

28:08.928 --> 28:11.033
I won the jackpot.

28:11.063 --> 28:12.371
How much?

28:12.398 --> 28:14.878
$786.

28:14.900 --> 28:16.140
Good God.

28:16.202 --> 28:18.045
So what do you have to say now?

28:18.070 --> 28:19.743
Bloody hell.

28:19.772 --> 28:22.116
- Do stop swearing.
- We can't keep the money.

28:22.141 --> 28:24.485
- It's ill-gotten gains.
- What?

28:24.543 --> 28:26.113
You broke the law, Margaret,

28:26.145 --> 28:28.455
a law that I'm sworn to uphold.

28:28.481 --> 28:30.757
Ll didn't think of it that way.

28:30.783 --> 28:32.503
I've never been on the
other side of the law

28:32.551 --> 28:34.588
from you, Thomas.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.122
Inspector.

28:36.155 --> 28:38.795
Yes. Inspector.

28:38.824 --> 28:42.067
So does this make me a criminal now?

28:42.094 --> 28:44.074
It does make me look at
you in a different way.

28:44.096 --> 28:45.473
Me too.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.246
James Pendrick isn't
the only one with a stake

28:52.271 --> 28:54.581
in this initial public offering.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.018
We need to get statements

28:56.075 --> 28:58.988
from each of these four private investors.

28:59.011 --> 29:02.322
Also, interview all of
the potential investors

29:02.348 --> 29:03.952
that were at Mr. Pendrick's dinner.

29:03.983 --> 29:05.929
Many of them will be at the race tomorrow.

29:05.951 --> 29:08.031
We need to find out if any
of them saw James Pendrick

29:08.087 --> 29:11.159
between 7:30 and 8:00 on
the night of the murder.

29:18.030 --> 29:19.475
Everything all right, sir?

29:19.498 --> 29:22.502
Bloody hell.

29:22.535 --> 29:23.946
Everything's all right, Murdoch.

29:29.775 --> 29:32.221
That, gentlemen, is called aerodynamics,

29:32.278 --> 29:34.451
and this, what you'll notice here-

29:34.480 --> 29:36.221
the lines on this thing, all right?

29:36.282 --> 29:38.193
Now, compare that with the blunt instrument

29:38.217 --> 29:40.629
that Henry Ford would drive.

29:40.653 --> 29:43.190
I hope you don't mind
a little shade, mister.

29:43.222 --> 29:45.395
Oh. Not at all.

29:45.458 --> 29:48.564
I tend to get sweaty in the midday sun.

29:48.627 --> 29:51.870
In short, more streamlined
than other vehicles.

29:51.897 --> 29:53.899
Like this here...

29:53.966 --> 29:56.469
Sarsaparilla.

29:56.502 --> 29:58.379
Ooh.

29:58.404 --> 30:00.077
No, thank you.

30:00.139 --> 30:02.085
Leslie Barnes.

30:02.141 --> 30:03.347
William Murdoch.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.321
Are you an investor?

30:05.344 --> 30:08.382
Well, let's just say that
I'm an-an interested party.

30:08.414 --> 30:10.052
Perhaps you'll see them in the future.

30:10.082 --> 30:11.755
Shall we take a photo, gentlemen?

30:11.817 --> 30:14.661
It's a great pleasure to
have you here with me today.

30:14.687 --> 30:15.995
Great. Wonderful.

30:16.021 --> 30:17.728
Thank you so much. Okay, thank you.

30:19.024 --> 30:20.264
Thank you for coming by.

30:20.326 --> 30:22.067
Here he comes now. Hello.

30:33.205 --> 30:35.276
Thank you for joining us, Mr. Ford.

30:35.341 --> 30:38.288
Gentlemen, you're about to witness

30:38.344 --> 30:40.290
a defining moment in history!

30:40.346 --> 30:42.849
We all know the automobile is coming.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.021
But what kind of automobile will it be?

30:45.050 --> 30:49.192
A clean, silent, electric motor

30:49.221 --> 30:52.031
or a noisy, belching, gasoline engine?

30:52.057 --> 30:55.061
Henry Ford has said the
electric car can't compete,

30:55.094 --> 30:57.267
that it can't go far enough,

30:57.296 --> 30:59.298
can't go fast enough.

30:59.365 --> 31:00.810
So today we're gonna race our cars

31:00.866 --> 31:02.971
the 20 miles to Markham and back.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.275
May the best car win.

31:10.476 --> 31:14.219
So who do you think's gonna
win this race, Mr. Murdoch?

31:14.246 --> 31:16.419
Well, I would have to say Mr. Pendrick.

31:16.448 --> 31:17.950
Course it's gonna be Pendrick.

31:17.983 --> 31:20.987
This whole race is a show
for would-be investors.

31:21.053 --> 31:24.557
He's not gonna host a race he can't win.

31:24.590 --> 31:27.127
Then why would Mr. Ford agree to race?

31:27.159 --> 31:31.437
Well, Henry Ford is incapable
of refusing a challenge.

31:31.463 --> 31:33.966
It's a failing, really...

31:33.999 --> 31:35.672
one that I admire.

31:43.576 --> 31:45.852
Mr. Pendrick, what's wrong?

31:45.911 --> 31:49.757
We've all heard the story
of the tortoise and the hare.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.125
Well, today the hare wins.

32:08.133 --> 32:09.703
What have you, George?

32:09.768 --> 32:11.941
Sir, I spoke to all four private investors.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.315
I think we can remove them from suspicion.

32:14.340 --> 32:16.149
They all have alibis?

32:16.175 --> 32:17.813
They no longer have motive, sir.

32:17.843 --> 32:19.845
They all sold their stakes
in Pendrick's company

32:19.878 --> 32:23.621
two weeks ago to a man named Barnes.

32:23.649 --> 32:25.026
Leslie Barnes?

32:25.050 --> 32:26.324
You've heard of him?

32:30.022 --> 32:32.127
Excellent work, George.

32:32.157 --> 32:34.398
Now interview all of
the potential investors

32:34.460 --> 32:35.905
that were at Pendrick's dinner.

32:35.961 --> 32:37.201
Sir.

33:05.920 --> 33:08.799
Yeah, I bought 'em out.

33:08.823 --> 33:10.530
For what purpose?

33:10.592 --> 33:12.799
Well, I'm trying to take
over Mr. Pendrick's company.

33:12.827 --> 33:14.773
Why?

33:14.796 --> 33:17.606
Well, it's a good product,
but Pendrick's a dreamer,

33:17.632 --> 33:20.203
wants to make the world a better place.

33:20.268 --> 33:23.977
A company like this needs a
profit-minded man at the helm.

33:24.005 --> 33:26.645
But you only have 45%.

33:26.674 --> 33:28.847
To control the company, you
would've had to have bought

33:28.877 --> 33:30.379
Ivan Wallensky's shares.

33:30.445 --> 33:32.482
Mm, that was my intention.

33:32.514 --> 33:35.222
I offered Ivan $50,000 for his shares.

33:35.283 --> 33:37.126
And what did he say?

33:37.152 --> 33:38.688
He said no.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.529
So I offered him $100,000.

33:40.555 --> 33:42.398
Said he'd think about it.

33:42.457 --> 33:43.731
When did this happen?

33:43.792 --> 33:45.897
About two weeks ago.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.997
Did James Pendrick know?

33:48.029 --> 33:50.635
Well, if he didn't know, he'd be a fool.

33:50.665 --> 33:52.906
Pendrick is no fool.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.594
Higgins!

34:14.656 --> 34:16.033
'Sir?

34:16.056 --> 34:17.536
Run out and get me a bottle of scotch.

34:17.559 --> 34:19.061
Oh, none of that low-end piss.

34:19.092 --> 34:21.094
Get me something from the Isle of Islay.

34:21.161 --> 34:23.005
That's spelt I-S-L-A-Y.

34:23.031 --> 34:24.772
- Mm?
- Oh, yeah.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.277
Oh, bloody hell.

34:26.333 --> 34:27.574
Hang on a sec.

34:32.907 --> 34:34.580
What happened to the petty cash?

34:34.609 --> 34:37.920
You spent it on the last bottle, sir.

34:37.946 --> 34:39.219
Oh.

34:48.790 --> 34:50.030
Hmm.

34:50.058 --> 34:51.799
Sir!

34:51.860 --> 34:53.703
Have you heard this?

34:53.728 --> 34:56.231
Apparently, Pendrick stopped
at the Markham lunch wagon...

34:56.264 --> 34:57.868
completely stopped, got out of the car,

34:57.899 --> 34:59.401
ordered the soup of the day.

34:59.434 --> 35:02.540
He was only at the halfway mark.

35:02.570 --> 35:04.709
Mr. Pendrick appears to
be putting on quite a show

35:04.739 --> 35:06.218
for his potential investors.

35:06.241 --> 35:07.982
Have you canvassed them?

35:08.042 --> 35:10.420
Uh, Worseley and I took
statements from everybody, sir.

35:10.445 --> 35:13.255
They all concur that Pendrick
was at the investors' dinner.

35:13.281 --> 35:14.658
I see.

35:14.716 --> 35:16.127
However, the dinner ended at 7:30.

35:16.150 --> 35:18.721
No one recalls seeing Pendrick after that.

35:18.753 --> 35:20.824
Mr. Pendrick knew that Ivan Wallensky

35:20.889 --> 35:22.891
could collapse his deal.

35:22.924 --> 35:24.597
So in his electric car,

35:24.626 --> 35:26.435
he could've made it to Wallensky's house

35:26.461 --> 35:29.305
and killed him before 8:00.

35:29.330 --> 35:31.833
Motive and opportunity, George.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.107
Here they come!

35:34.135 --> 35:36.081
Ford's in the lead!

35:45.914 --> 35:47.587
Here comes Pendrick!

36:17.278 --> 36:20.157
We did it. We did it.

36:20.181 --> 36:21.524
Out of the way.

36:21.549 --> 36:22.789
- Yes.
- Excuse us.

36:22.817 --> 36:24.854
Out of the way.

36:24.886 --> 36:26.832
Congratulations, Mr. Pendrick.

36:26.854 --> 36:28.128
Thank you, Detective.

36:28.156 --> 36:29.567
I'm placing you under arrest

36:29.624 --> 36:31.331
for the murder of Ivan Wallensky.

36:41.636 --> 36:43.356
Am I to understand an arrest has been made

36:43.371 --> 36:44.873
in my father's murder?

36:44.906 --> 36:47.011
Yes, I believe they've
arrested James Pendrick.

36:47.041 --> 36:48.987
You're making a mistake, Murdoch.

36:49.010 --> 36:50.853
You bastard!

36:50.878 --> 36:53.154
You think that you could kill
my father and get away with it?

36:53.181 --> 36:54.819
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Mr. Wallensky...

36:54.849 --> 36:56.829
I'm gonna ruin you, Pendrick.

36:56.851 --> 36:59.832
I'm selling my father's shares
to man named Leslie Barnes!

36:59.854 --> 37:01.094
Ever heard of him?

37:01.155 --> 37:02.566
Get him out of here.

37:02.590 --> 37:05.594
I'm gonna see you ruined!

37:05.660 --> 37:07.867
Right this way, Mr. Pendrick.

37:11.999 --> 37:14.809
You are aware of Barnes'
offer to buy Ivan's shares?

37:17.259 --> 37:18.602
Mr. Pendrick?

37:18.627 --> 37:20.402
For God's sakes, I have an alibi!

37:20.429 --> 37:22.204
No one at the dinner recalls seeing you

37:22.231 --> 37:24.074
after 7:30, Mr. Pendrick.

37:24.100 --> 37:25.977
And as you demonstrated today,

37:26.035 --> 37:27.605
you had more than enough time to make it

37:27.636 --> 37:29.616
to Ivan Wallensky's house before 8:00

37:29.638 --> 37:32.881
in your electric car.

37:32.908 --> 37:35.252
Detective, please.

37:35.277 --> 37:36.756
I have to attend to business

37:36.779 --> 37:38.816
before Ivan's son does irreparable damage

37:38.881 --> 37:40.417
to my company.

37:40.449 --> 37:44.488
If you keep me in custody,
I could lose everything.

37:44.553 --> 37:48.091
The only person who's lost
everything in this matter,

37:48.124 --> 37:51.799
Mr. Pendrick, is Mr. Wallensky.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.847
Hmm.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.008
You owe it to yourself,
Thomas S. Brackenreid.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.250
Sod it.

38:21.857 --> 38:23.803
Bloody hell.

38:34.503 --> 38:36.005
Sir, as per your request,

38:36.038 --> 38:37.949
I looked into Leslie
Barnes' recent dealings.

38:37.973 --> 38:39.475
And?

38:39.508 --> 38:41.351
It was all very obscure, but I did discover

38:41.377 --> 38:43.323
he's the president of a holding company.

38:43.345 --> 38:44.847
What do they have holdings in?

38:44.880 --> 38:46.826
Mostly assets in the transportation sector

38:46.849 --> 38:50.695
including a stake in the
Detroit Automobile Company.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.221
That's Henry Ford's company.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.528
Very interesting.

38:53.556 --> 38:55.058
Well, I thought so as well, sir.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.502
I've taken the liberty of asking him in.

39:01.864 --> 39:03.866
When I was an engineer at Edison,

39:03.899 --> 39:07.244
we needed investors for our
gasoline-powered automobile.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.840
Barnes was one of the
people who showed interest.

39:09.872 --> 39:12.352
At the time, he was working
for an oil consortium.

39:12.374 --> 39:14.650
- Oil.
- Makes sense.

39:14.677 --> 39:16.816
My automobiles need gasoline.

39:16.846 --> 39:18.519
The oil companies would only be too happy

39:18.547 --> 39:20.686
to see my cars on every
street in this continent.

39:20.716 --> 39:25.563
So why then invest in an electric car?

39:25.588 --> 39:27.455
Perhaps he's hedging his bets.

39:31.093 --> 39:33.266
Mr. Pendrick.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.502
You're aware that Leslie
Barnes was attempting

39:35.531 --> 39:39.069
to take a controlling
interest in your company,

39:39.101 --> 39:42.605
but do you know who Mr. Barnes represents?

39:42.671 --> 39:46.778
Private clients looking to get rich.

39:46.842 --> 39:49.254
Oil companies, Mr. Pendrick,

39:49.278 --> 39:51.758
some of the biggest.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.851
Oil.

39:53.883 --> 39:55.885
Now, why would an oil consortium

39:55.918 --> 39:59.388
want to take a controlling
interest in your company?

40:04.927 --> 40:06.201
Stop!

40:08.097 --> 40:09.303
Pendrick!

40:42.798 --> 40:44.004
No.

40:44.066 --> 40:45.272
No! Come on!

40:45.301 --> 40:47.941
Come on! Come on!

41:04.954 --> 41:06.160
I have to stop them.

41:06.188 --> 41:08.930
Ooh. Mr. Pendrick.

41:08.958 --> 41:11.837
An oil consortium won't want
to build my electric car.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.464
They want to destroy it.

41:26.041 --> 41:28.043
E.U, Douglas?

41:28.110 --> 41:30.852
This whole time, you were working for them?

41:30.879 --> 41:32.825
Sorry, James.

41:32.848 --> 41:34.452
It's just business.

41:34.483 --> 41:35.689
Ah.

41:35.718 --> 41:37.129
Mr. Pendrick.

41:37.152 --> 41:39.462
Put down the gun.

41:39.488 --> 41:41.195
And allow this travesty to proceed?

41:41.223 --> 41:42.725
I think not.

41:42.791 --> 41:45.203
You so much as put a mark on that contract,

41:45.227 --> 41:47.036
I will stain it with your blood.

41:47.062 --> 41:48.507
Ironic, isn't it?

41:48.530 --> 41:50.168
If you hadn't killed my father,

41:50.199 --> 41:52.475
these shares wouldn't be mine to sell.

41:52.501 --> 41:55.505
As it is...

41:55.537 --> 41:56.743
Touché.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.011
No! No!

41:59.508 --> 42:00.748
Enough!

42:05.468 --> 42:09.712
Mr. Pendrick, a man has
already been murdered.

42:09.739 --> 42:11.810
And I believe his killer is in this room.

42:11.874 --> 42:14.150
I swear by God, I didn't kill Ivan.

42:14.210 --> 42:16.156
No, Mr. Pendrick, and I believe you.

42:16.212 --> 42:17.418
What?

42:17.447 --> 42:18.926
Ivan Wallensky

42:18.948 --> 42:21.827
wouldn't sell his shares to Mr. Barnes.

42:21.884 --> 42:23.295
Instead, he tried to sue you

42:23.319 --> 42:24.923
for a larger stake in the company.

42:24.954 --> 42:26.456
Isn't that right, Mr. Pendrick?

42:26.489 --> 42:28.093
Yes.

42:28.124 --> 42:30.104
So then why kill the man who wouldn't sell

42:30.126 --> 42:32.572
when his shares would've been inherited

42:32.595 --> 42:34.233
by the son who would

42:34.263 --> 42:39.235
unless you were the buyer?

42:39.268 --> 42:40.770
Now, hold on a second.

42:40.803 --> 42:42.578
Are you suggesting... 

42:42.605 --> 42:45.017
Mr. Barnes, you told me the
last conversation you had

42:45.074 --> 42:47.145
with Ivan Wallensky was two weeks ago.

42:47.176 --> 42:49.087
That is the absolute truth.

42:49.112 --> 42:51.023
Where did this conversation take place?

42:51.080 --> 42:52.616
In his workshop.

42:52.648 --> 42:54.594
And that was the last
time you spoke with him.

42:54.617 --> 42:56.324
That's right.

42:56.352 --> 42:57.854
Well, then, Mr. Barnes, tell me,

42:57.920 --> 43:00.867
why did I find your brand
of cigar in the ashtray

43:00.923 --> 43:04.666
in Ivan Wallensky's house two weeks later?

43:04.694 --> 43:06.537
Oh, my goodness. I didn't even see that.

43:06.596 --> 43:08.132
What kind of housekeeper am I?

43:08.164 --> 43:09.507
Mrs. Chalmers.

43:09.532 --> 43:10.840
Evidence.

43:13.202 --> 43:15.614
You were there the night
Ivan Wallensky was murdered,

43:15.638 --> 43:17.982
weren't you?

43:18.007 --> 43:19.486
I was.

43:19.509 --> 43:22.353
But I did not speak to Ivan.

43:22.378 --> 43:24.380
Well, then.

43:24.447 --> 43:26.449
Who did you have a conversation with?

43:31.888 --> 43:33.492
Yes, we met!

43:33.523 --> 43:35.560
What of it?

43:35.625 --> 43:38.697
What was the conversation
about, Mr. Barnes?

43:38.728 --> 43:41.641
I was trying to convince
Alexander to persuade his father

43:41.664 --> 43:44.645
to accept my offer.

43:44.667 --> 43:46.374
Well.

43:46.402 --> 43:48.643
Strange, then, that when we first spoke,

43:48.671 --> 43:50.173
you told me you knew nothing

43:50.206 --> 43:53.881
about your father's business affairs.

43:53.910 --> 43:56.356
You did try to convince him, didn't you?

43:56.379 --> 43:57.585
Listen to me.

43:57.647 --> 43:59.718
$100,000.

43:59.749 --> 44:02.093
That's a lot of money.

44:02.151 --> 44:03.528
You would've inherited all of it.

44:03.553 --> 44:06.227
You would've been a rich man.

44:06.255 --> 44:10.670
But your father refused to sell.

44:17.099 --> 44:19.079
He was my friend.

44:19.101 --> 44:22.344
That's enough, Mr. Pendrick.

44:26.409 --> 44:28.252
At least Alexander won't be able to profit

44:28.277 --> 44:30.052
from his father's death.

44:30.079 --> 44:31.683
Doesn't matter.

44:31.714 --> 44:34.752
The deal he signed with
Leslie Barnes is still valid.

44:34.784 --> 44:39.028
What about your company's
initial public offering?

44:39.055 --> 44:40.728
Barnes and his oil consortium

44:40.756 --> 44:42.793
own a controlling interest in my company.

44:42.859 --> 44:44.930
There won't be a public offering.

44:44.961 --> 44:47.965
All they wanted was Ivan's battery patent,

44:48.030 --> 44:50.738
which they'll now let collect dust.

44:50.766 --> 44:54.213
Until the internal combustion
engine reigns supreme.

44:57.373 --> 44:59.614
They ruined me, Murdoch.

44:59.642 --> 45:01.952
They won, and I've lost everything.

45:01.978 --> 45:04.982
I'm so sorry, Mr. Pendrick.

45:05.047 --> 45:08.221
So am I.

45:08.251 --> 45:10.322
It would've worked, Murdoch.

45:12.755 --> 45:15.258
It would've changed the future.

45:21.664 --> 45:23.905
I've yet to crack the seal.

45:23.933 --> 45:25.310
Sir, just replace the difference

45:25.334 --> 45:26.677
from your earnings

45:26.736 --> 45:28.181
and send the money to City Treasury.

45:28.237 --> 45:29.614
I don't want to do that.

45:29.639 --> 45:31.744
Margaret won that money fair and square,

45:31.774 --> 45:33.654
and I'll be damned if
I'm gonna see it disappear

45:33.676 --> 45:35.781
in some ledger book at City Hall.

45:35.811 --> 45:37.347
It's what's required by law.

45:37.413 --> 45:38.687
Bugger the law.

45:38.748 --> 45:40.284
I'm gonna put the money into a fund

45:40.316 --> 45:42.193
for the widows and orphans
of the Constabulary.

45:42.251 --> 45:43.628
Any objections?

45:43.653 --> 45:45.257
No, that seems like a fair compromise.

45:45.288 --> 45:46.528
Ah, Crabtree.

45:46.589 --> 45:48.296
Sir, here's a list of stocks

45:48.324 --> 45:50.304
that I've invested a few
of my extra pennies with.

45:50.326 --> 45:52.272
I've added Mr. Ford's
company and Standard Oil.

45:52.295 --> 45:54.172
I think they'll both do quite well.

45:54.196 --> 45:57.177
You're investing the money
from the widows and orphans fund

45:57.199 --> 45:58.644
in the stock market?

45:58.668 --> 46:00.272
Coca-Cola.

46:00.303 --> 46:02.613
Oh, very refreshing,
sir. I suggest you try it.

46:02.638 --> 46:04.379
George, you're investing in the fortunes

46:04.440 --> 46:06.147
of a soft drink company

46:06.175 --> 46:09.384
over the security of a
Canadian government bond?

46:09.445 --> 46:11.391
That's folly, George.

46:11.447 --> 46:15.556
"Business Machines, Bell
Telephone, General Electric?"

46:15.618 --> 46:17.188
These are gambles.

46:17.219 --> 46:20.393
Yes, but it's legal gambling, isn't it?

46:20.456 --> 46:22.402
Well, I'll stick with my bonds.

46:22.458 --> 46:23.869
I'll stick with my stocks for now.

46:23.893 --> 46:25.372
We'll see how it pans out.

46:25.394 --> 46:27.567
Invest how you think best, Crabtree.

46:27.630 --> 46:29.075
Right.

46:29.131 --> 46:30.906
I'm off to meet Margaret for dinner.

46:30.967 --> 46:32.810
How do I look?

46:32.835 --> 46:34.872
How do you look?

46:34.904 --> 46:37.350
How do I look?

46:37.373 --> 46:38.909
Uh, positively dashing, sir.

46:38.975 --> 46:40.318
Ah. Very good.

46:40.343 --> 46:42.721
Well, good evening, gentlemen.

46:47.216 --> 46:48.422
Dashing.

46:48.484 --> 46:49.724
Good one, George.
