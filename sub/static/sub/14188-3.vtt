Come on, wake up! Come on, Bubble,
try and concentrate!

00:27.480 --> 00:29.391
I've got important information to tell you.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.795
I am going to be in France
for nearly a whole week,

00:32.000 --> 00:33.718
and I'm counting on you to cope.

00:33.920 --> 00:38.118
You only have to concentrate on one
thing-the refurbishment of Bettina's flat.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.311
The refurbishment of Bettina's flat.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.829
I promised it would be finished this week.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.237
When she said "Third World Chic"
I was hoping she would stick to it,

00:46.440 --> 00:51.958
but it took me hours to get that fly-blown
mud hessian for her kitchen walls.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.072
There's a nomadic tribe
in the North African desert

00:55.280 --> 00:59.398
that's going to be travelling rather light
this winter, thanks to Bettina.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.716
When the wood arrives
for the kitchen surfaces

01:01.920 --> 01:03.717
remember to stamp it
"Greenpeace Approved".

01:03.920 --> 01:07.276
- "Greenpeace Approved".
- If the silk for the cushion doesn't arrive,

01:07.480 --> 01:10.358
then fax Calcutta
and tell them to weave faster.

01:10.560 --> 01:14.030
What can they be doing?
Squatting inside the room, making chapattis?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.071
Poor Bettina.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.399
Bonjour. Oui, oui.!

01:19.600 --> 01:23.479
Also, I'll try and phone you
from my mobile,

01:23.680 --> 01:26.069
but I'm not sure it'll work from France.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.272
I'd understand what you were saying.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.677
- Oh, darling...
- You do speak French, don't you?

01:32.880 --> 01:37.635
Of course I speak French.
Someone has been stealing from me.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.116
- Saffy.
- Morning, dear.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.313
- What are you doing here?
- Keeping Saffron company while you're away.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.239
- No, you're not. Is she, sweetie?
- I don't mind.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.797
Saffy doesn't want you here cramping
her style. She wants a little freedom.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.515
She wants to have parties and
have boys around and play loud music.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.551
- And have orgies.
- Yes, and snogging.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.433
Smash the place up a bit
and crash out on the floor.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.029
- In a pool of sick.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.470
- I don't.
- Why not, darling?

02:08.680 --> 02:10.955
Why not try it just once, sweetie?

02:11.160 --> 02:13.833
You're not like your mother
in that respect, are you, Saffron?

02:14.040 --> 02:17.350
She spent most of her teenage years
sitting on a large bean-bag,

02:17.560 --> 02:19.676
cigarette in one hand, joss-stick in the other

02:19.880 --> 02:23.236
with a large-lipped youth
suctioned onto her face.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.149
Come here, darling. Come away
from that woman. I want to speak to you.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.999
Nice cup of tea.
Where would one find the tea bags?

02:30.200 --> 02:33.112
We don't have tea bags.
We happen to have tea.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.470
Come over here, sweetie.
I want to talk to you.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.878
Something has been stolen
from my room.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.868
- What?
- A certain something precious to me.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.231
- Have you seen this pot?
- Where? What? Oh.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.157
It's a sort of space-age teapot,
isn't it, dear?

02:56.360 --> 02:59.557
A teapot to boldly go
where no teapot has been before

02:59.760 --> 03:02.274
to seek out new life forms.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.711
- I hid your stash.
- Where?

03:05.920 --> 03:07.876
- Down the toilet.
- Ah!

03:08.080 --> 03:10.389
What might one use
to put the tea in the pot with?

03:10.600 --> 03:13.319
A teaspoon,
a bloody, buggery teaspoon!

03:13.520 --> 03:17.274
Oh! A bloody, buggery teaspoon.
That sounds rather clever.

03:17.480 --> 03:21.917
And what did one fill the kettle from?
The bloody marvellous tap, I suppose?

03:22.120 --> 03:25.635
We happen to have
a filter here, alright?

03:25.840 --> 03:28.400
God, you come around here
and make endless fuss.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.114
It's my house
where I should be able to do what I want.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.232
If only people
would let me get on with it.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.069
So, I have been busted
by my own daughter, have I?

03:38.280 --> 03:41.272
- What am I supposed to do now?
- What were you planning to do?

03:41.480 --> 03:43.152
Slide it into
the lining of your handbag,

03:43.360 --> 03:46.750
or insert it into some orifice
for some dog to sniff at?

03:46.960 --> 03:49.076
I can't believe you were taking it with you.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.716
I don't mind if you have to have
the odd joint at home, in your bedroom.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.037
Oh, sweetie, thank you.
How kind, darling!

03:56.240 --> 03:59.312
It was for personal use.
You're allowed it for personal use.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.957
- Yes, but they would send you to prison.
- Not someone like me. Not any more.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.630
- Pathetic.
- This filtered water boils very fast.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.195
- That's because there's less of it.
- Ah.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.960
I mean, they are illegal drugs.

04:13.160 --> 04:16.310
You use them like people have
after-dinner mints, to round off a meal

04:16.519 --> 04:20.035
You sniff something to make you speedy
or smoke to make you jelly-brained.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.312
Either way, you end up more boring
than you can imagine.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.034
That's rich from someone who lives
a life that's so boring

04:26.240 --> 04:30.597
it would make a battery chicken
take up an evening class.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.679
Mum, you are supporting
a criminal, corrupt, evil system.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.713
- Is she insisting on voting Labour again?
- Oh, shut up!

04:38.560 --> 04:41.472
You're no different
to a junkie on the street, to a dealer.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.752
As long as people like you go on
doing it, giving it a hint of respectability,

04:44.960 --> 04:46.279
the evil will continue.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.472
Governments will be undermined,
countries kept poor, children corrupted,

04:49.680 --> 04:53.832
individuals will be killed,
intimidated and tortured.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.192
God, you've overdosed on bloody
John Craven's Newsround again!

04:59.280 --> 05:01.111
That'll be Patsy.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.629
Oh, I'll go.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.478
Bonjour, sweetie.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.958
- Oh, Patricia!
- Oh, hello.

05:12.160 --> 05:17.439
How nice.
Oh, still no ring on that finger, then.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.200
- Still no husband?
- No one special Eddy!

05:20.400 --> 05:23.790
Well... And you were always
the one with the boys.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.515
It seems so strange to me that
Edwina should have been married twice,

05:27.720 --> 05:29.278
and you still a spinster.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.072
Oh, I don't know.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.798
- Still blonde?
- Yes.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.560
- Still managing to keep that up?
- Yes. Is Eddy here?

05:36.760 --> 05:40.912
- Yes, she is. Lovely old Patsy is here, dear.
- Come on, Eddy.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.590
No, no. Patsy, here's Saffy.
Saffy, here's Auntie Patsy.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.711
- Bye-bye, Auntie Patsy.
- Come on, Eddy.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.353
- Bye, Mum.
- Goodbye.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.118
- Take care.
- I will

05:50.320 --> 05:53.995
- Be careful Passport, tickets, condoms...
- Yes, darling.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.678
You! Remember to cancel
my aromatherapy, psychotherapy,

05:59.880 --> 06:03.111
my reflexology, osteopath, homeopath,
naturopath, crystal reading, shiatsu,

06:03.320 --> 06:06.756
my organic hairdresser and see if I can
be rebirthed next Thursday afternoon.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.190
Consider it done.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.794
- Du vin rouge.?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.195
- And those two vodkas.
- De la vodka.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.709
- This...
- Ça c'est du parfum, madame.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.433
Oui.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.110
- And two champagnes.
- Du champagne.?

06:24.320 --> 06:26.356
- Thank you. What's in there?
- La poubelle, madame.

06:26.560 --> 06:30.519
- Yeah, we'll have two of those.
- Vous desirez des cacahouettes.?

06:30.720 --> 06:33.792
- No.
- Oi, peanuts!

06:34.000 --> 06:37.151
Sullen, stingy, bloody French bitch.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.757
- Madame...
- Mademoiselle.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.030
I'm going to have a healthy week, Pats.
I'm not eating and not drinking.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.514
Right.

06:49.720 --> 06:54.874
I'm just eating fruit.
Just eating fruit and not drinking.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.310
You can't go to France and not drink.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.557
We're staying in the middle of a vineyard.
The area alone is 15% proof.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.432
Oh well, I'll drink just wine.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.712
Eat just fruit, drink just wine
and not smoke. That's good.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.229
And I'm not having sex.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.590
- Are you sure, darling?
- Yes, positive.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.237
Alright, then. OK.
Are we starting now or when we land?

07:16.240 --> 07:18.310
I think I can safely start now.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.755
No, let's say when we land.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:32.600 --> 07:36.070
Wake up, Pats, look at this.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.316
 Mm...

07:38.520 --> 07:40.351
 Hang on,
let's cope with this corner.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.757
 Oh, it's gorgeous.
 Look, it's a little town.

07:43.960 --> 07:48.829
 This is it, isn't it.? Look.
Wake up, Pats.! Is this the house.?

07:49.040 --> 07:53.750
 Oh, God.!
Eddy, we've been down this road before.

07:53.960 --> 07:58.397
 That is the same village
we are going back into.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.397
 What's wrong.?

08:03.040 --> 08:04.314
 Wake up.!

08:05.520 --> 08:09.149
Am I on the right side of the road?
I can't go on until I'm sure.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.590
Keep driving, Eddy.
You haven't hit anything yet.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.598
This is here. I should be
on the right-hand side of the road.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.995
- Do you want me to drive?
- Oh, so speaks the woman

08:17.200 --> 08:22.433
whose head has been lolling like a bladder
on a stick the whole way. Get the maps.

08:25.840 --> 08:30.118
This is Spain.
Read the instructions.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.232
"Leave airport, turn right..."
Blah, blah, blah.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.351
Right. Now get in, Pats.

08:35.559 --> 08:38.518
I shouldn't have gone left, should I? I mean...

08:44.560 --> 08:50.032
 Going back to that
bloody airport, we'll never find it.

08:50.240 --> 08:55.030
Oh, God.! I hate France, I hate it.!

08:57.200 --> 09:01.478
 Oh, God.!
Eight hours, Pats, it has taken us.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.231
That knocks your idea of wild nightlife
in St Tropez on the head, doesn't it.?

09:09.840 --> 09:15.312
 Eight hours,
eight bloody hours. If you hadn't...

09:15.520 --> 09:19.115
 We went in so many bloody circles
we might be ten minutes from St Tropez.

09:19.320 --> 09:24.758
 I don't think so. The sky lost that
comforting orange glow a long way back.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.556
Oh, it's gorgeous.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.836
After eight hours
in that bloody car with you, Patsy,

09:33.040 --> 09:36.919
the local pissoir
looked rather gorgeous. But this?

09:37.120 --> 09:39.918
Oh, shut up, Eddy.
We want something to eat and drink.

09:40.120 --> 09:45.638
Oh, God! To eat, Patsy,
I can see four pieces of dried-up pasta

09:45.840 --> 09:50.436
and half a packet of French toast
which defies eating at the best of times.

09:50.640 --> 09:55.316
A cockroach, a cockroach,
a dead cockroach!

09:55.520 --> 09:58.910
Don't kill it! I'm a Buddhist,
I could come back as one of those.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.390
- Oh!
- I think it had a coronary, sweetie.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.831
Oh, God! Insects, insects!

10:06.040 --> 10:08.110
They followed me,
those bloody insects.

10:08.320 --> 10:11.995
Insects follow me everywhere,
from Tuscany to the Caribbean.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.395
Insects, insects, insects!

10:14.600 --> 10:18.309
I usually see pictures of glamorous
houses in Marrakesh, for God's sake.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.080
You don't see spiders
scuttling into the corner.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.956
You never see a picture of Jane Seymour
with a centipede dangling from her tiara!

10:26.160 --> 10:28.355
No, they just follow me,
they bloody follow me.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.835
A mosquito has never bitten you,
for God's sake!

10:31.040 --> 10:34.953
The last mosquito that bit me
had to book in to the Betty Ford Clinic.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.515
Exactly!

10:38.840 --> 10:41.070
Oh, God, I hate France!

10:42.720 --> 10:45.314
I'm having a little trouble
finding the BBC, dear.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.353
I flicked through about 15 channels.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.951
You've got it on satellite.
Press that one.

10:51.160 --> 10:56.951
No wonder! I kept seeing these
Italian housewives taking their bras off.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.596
I thought,
"This can't be Challenge Anneka."

11:00.800 --> 11:02.836
Can I help myself to a sherry, dear?

11:03.720 --> 11:06.029
Oh, or shall I have a Japanese beer?

11:07.880 --> 11:09.313
No.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.158
 Straw dogs!
 It's alright.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.193
 I've got a lighter.
 That's typical, isn't it?

11:14.400 --> 11:18.678
When you go abroad, all the lights go out
at the slightest suggestion of a thunderstorm.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.519
That's typical, isn't it?
Oh, let's all join Europe

11:21.720 --> 11:25.952
so the lights can bloody go out
everywhere. Sieg heil, the Federal State!

11:26.160 --> 11:29.789
What's the matter with you?
You need a joint, we both need a joint.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.788
I haven't got any. Saffy flushed all mine,
the lot. I thought you had something.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.072
I was counting on you. I've only got
some coke and some ecstasy.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.319
Are you mad?
No one's taking that any more.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.318
- Well, I'm going to bed.
- Just leave me here, stranded.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.159
Darling, there's only
one candle, sweetie.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.238
 Careful here, we could
come across a corpse.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.475
I'm very sorry about
the bloody ozone layer,

12:01.680 --> 12:04.717
but this is a matter
of human survival here.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.079
Pats, go down to the village.
You know what we need.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.317
- I don't know what we need.
- Yes, you do, darling!

12:12.520 --> 12:18.197
You know, milk and bread and cheese
and little French things. Go on.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.995
- Why don't you go?
- I'll write it down for you. Hang on.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.872
Look, come on, sweetie.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.629
Look, we need bread... pan...

12:29.000 --> 12:33.391
...some bakery
...pa-pa-pa... painerie.

12:34.440 --> 12:38.991
- Blancmangerie.?
- And a few little vegatables from the grocerie.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.115
A few little things, anyway.
Go on, off you go.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.914
- Look, Eddy, you do it.
- Oh, no!

12:45.120 --> 12:48.954
OK, but you have to call Saffy and
Bubble and let them know we're here.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.639
I tried. I don't know the code.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.434
- Isn't it the same as from LA?
- It doesn't work!

12:53.640 --> 12:56.632
- Anyway, there isn't a book.
- We'll just phone the operateur.

12:56.840 --> 13:01.391
- And say what?
- Well, the code for Englaterre.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.751
- For Londra, for God's sake!
- I'll do it when you've gone.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.748
- Oh. Have you got some money, darling?
- Yes, I've got lots.

13:11.680 --> 13:12.954
Well, well, well...

13:15.360 --> 13:18.909
- Is that enough?
- That's about 500 pounds...

13:21.040 --> 13:23.270
I've got cards.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.876
Alright... See you later.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.637
Oh, God!

13:45.240 --> 13:49.756
et puis, qui vous-êtes, vous.?
Le château est à 400 mètres.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.836
Vous ne comprenez pas.?
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici.?

14:03.800 --> 14:06.917
J'espère que vous passerez
de bonnes vacances.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.756
They must be getting closer now.

15:09.960 --> 15:14.397
If you get through, I'll ask Saffy
to come and bring food, shall I?

15:14.600 --> 15:17.956
We don't want her down here.
Get her to phone up in French,

15:18.160 --> 15:20.754
order the food from Paris
and have it sent down.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.390
Zero, one, four...

15:36.360 --> 15:38.078
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici.?

15:39.240 --> 15:41.993
Pats, Pats!
Come here, quickly!

15:42.200 --> 15:44.270
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici.?
- Oh, God!

15:44.480 --> 15:46.869
Le château est à 400 mètres.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.389
- Phoosh!
- Err!

15:49.600 --> 15:52.034
Ab-ab-ab... See you!

15:56.280 --> 15:59.158
- Has she rung?
- No, what's the matter?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.590
It's urgent.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.873
A very angry man called
to say that she's to sign this,

16:06.080 --> 16:09.117
or the work won't be finished on...

16:13.240 --> 16:16.232
...doings' flat.
- Can't it wait?

16:16.440 --> 16:20.069
It's cutting it really, really fine
if I leave it 'til she gets back.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.477
In fact, I think he wants it
tomorrow morning.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.717
This sort of thing's
never happened to me before.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.876
Well, you've never
done anything before.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.312
I know. I don't know why she wants
to do this interior design thing.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.114
There's just so much work!

16:36.320 --> 16:40.871
She never would be told. She's always
had her own ideas about decorating.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.709
How she could live in that room
of hers at home, I don't know.

16:44.920 --> 16:51.029
Since she left, it has had two coats
of paint and three different wallpapers,

16:51.240 --> 16:57.475
and when the light's right, I can still
see Jimi Hendrix's face staring at me.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.752
♪ Purple haze, all in my brain...

17:02.800 --> 17:04.392
♪ Never the same...

17:04.599 --> 17:06.238
 Oh, dear...

17:07.079 --> 17:09.719
Hello? Mum?

17:09.920 --> 17:14.152
No. How can you have malnutrition?

17:24.640 --> 17:28.076
He likes you, darling.
He fancies you. You go.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.709
Thank God!

17:38.000 --> 17:39.638
Wine!

17:39.840 --> 17:43.230
Eddy, Rosemary's baby
has arrived with food!

17:43.440 --> 17:46.750
Oh, sweetie!
Food, wine! Hurrah!

17:46.960 --> 17:49.155
Oh, God! Hello, darling.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.715
- It's not really what I imagined.
- Horrible, isn't it?

17:51.920 --> 17:54.036
- I like it.
- It's been a nightmare.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.753
- Have you eaten?
- No.

17:55.960 --> 17:59.396
Oh, good. I'll do one of my specials.
I'll throw some tomatoes and olive oil

17:59.600 --> 18:01.033
and garlic into a pan.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.356
- A sandwich would do.
- No, I'll do my special

18:03.560 --> 18:06.313
Come on, can you hand me
a frying pan?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.238
Saff, give me a little frying pan.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.908
- Argh!
- Bonjour.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.715
Anyone fancy a game of table tennis?

18:23.360 --> 18:26.079
I'm sorry there's nothing to do, darling.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.396
What do you mean?
There's plenty to do.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.070
You could walk, or paint,
or play a game of table tennis.

18:32.280 --> 18:37.229
I suppose that's alright if you're some
deprived kid at its first youth club.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.193
Or in prison at Cell Block H.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.709
- Bubble?
- Oh, yeah!

18:43.640 --> 18:46.393
I hope I can remember how to play.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.753
Shh, shh, shh!

18:56.960 --> 18:59.076
Bubble, have you moved?

18:59.280 --> 19:01.840
You'll be a bush anyway,
I've got my green mixed up.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.395
I've done you, Patsy. You can go.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.272
It's lovely here.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.429
It's lovely, yes.

19:27.640 --> 19:32.031
How can you not be enjoying it?
It's so peaceful and relaxing.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.959
Just walking, reading
and playing games.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.913
- It's fun.
- Fun?

19:38.120 --> 19:44.150
Hm. I can see it should be fun,
I know it should be fun, sweetie. It's...

19:45.400 --> 19:50.394
It's like a secret no one's let me in on.
It's your sort of fun.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.591
Mm? Yeah.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.713
Yes. Well, I think I'll go
and have a stroll in the village.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.434
I won't come.

20:01.600 --> 20:06.833
Pats! You know that chateau
at the station that we passed?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.632
What do you think?

20:21.440 --> 20:25.433
Oh... Fabulous. Fantastique.

20:25.640 --> 20:30.589
 Now, which one? We've tried this one.
 I like this one.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.314
It's this one...
This is the one, Pats.

20:33.520 --> 20:39.277
- This one... This is the one, sweetie.
- We've tried this one.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.869
 This one, have you tried this one?
- What's this?

20:42.080 --> 20:44.913
What's this? We haven't tried this one.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.031
We'll try this one!

20:48.280 --> 20:51.033
- This is the one.
- No, this is the one.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.834
That's the one we like.
This is the one we like.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.828
This is the one we didn't want,
the empty one. We didn't want this one,

20:58.040 --> 21:01.191
but this is the one...
This is the one we wanted.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.673
That is the one that... we don't want.

21:10.920 --> 21:15.471
Right, this was one, this was one
and this was one.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.035
 We haven't tried this one.
- This one.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.152
 And that box.
We're having the box as well, aren't we?

21:48.840 --> 21:52.594
Shit! Someone's taken
the steering-wheel!

22:04.680 --> 22:06.272
Thanks, Ed.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.277
Right, so...

22:09.800 --> 22:14.191
Right, if you do the sky,
I'll do the grass.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.197
Alright.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.675
Fancy a game of doubles?

22:27.400 --> 22:29.038
No, I don't play.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.629
I'm only going to play
if I can play with Eddy.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.035
In a minute.

22:36.360 --> 22:41.912
It's so stupid! They've made the holes
the wrong shape for the pieces.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.313
Come on, Patsy!

22:51.320 --> 22:53.754
 At least you're not playing with
a liquorice all-sorts...

22:53.960 --> 22:55.279
 She's very good.

22:55.480 --> 22:59.314
I'm in the game as well
You could hit it to me sometimes.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.669
- Pats, Pats.
- Darling, wipe it, wipe it, wipe it.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.839
Look, look. Let's stop and think about
the rules for a second. I'll keep score.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.758
- First service.
 Hit it to me!

23:10.960 --> 23:12.996
- To Bubble.
 No, to me!

23:14.760 --> 23:17.035
Oh, well done! Lovely!

23:18.920 --> 23:22.310
 Everybody stop it.
You're not allowed to play until I'm ready.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.956
 I want you two to keep
an eye on the score. Hand me that ball

23:28.080 --> 23:31.311
- Yes!

23:33.760 --> 23:35.637
Oh, I'm broke.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.751
Take another mortgage. Don't give in.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.997
- What, on a "get out of jail free" card?
- Well, try.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.713
I thought you were broke.
Where did you get all that money from?

23:45.920 --> 23:48.195
- Don't question me.
- Where did you get it?

23:48.400 --> 23:50.755
I borrowed it from the bank.

23:51.560 --> 23:55.678
- You can't do that. That's cheating!
- Listen, you little stoat. I own Park Lane.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.633
I can borrow
as much bloody money as I like.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.592
Come on. Honestly, Saffy!

24:00.800 --> 24:04.031
Try and get into
the spirit of the thing, sweetie.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.516
Oh, jeepers creepers!

24:17.720 --> 24:19.950
- Go and give it to her now. There's still time.
- No.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.912
- Go on.
- You.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.429
Don't be silly. Go on!

24:31.400 --> 24:33.231
Get me to that phone!

24:35.080 --> 24:37.389
Ingleterra, Ingleterra.!

24:38.040 --> 24:39.314
Jesus!

24:40.240 --> 24:42.276
Pronto.!

24:49.760 --> 24:52.558
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez
dans cette baraque.?

24:53.520 --> 24:56.717
He says he's wondering
why we've been staying at the cottage.

24:56.920 --> 24:59.912
Enfin, le château est à 400 mètres,
le personnel vous attend.

25:00.120 --> 25:05.592
The staff have been expecting us
at the chateau half a mile down the road.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.837
J'espère que vous passerez
de bonnes vacances, va.!

25:09.040 --> 25:12.589
Ahh...
He hopes we had a pleasant stay.

25:13.960 --> 25:17.919
Listen, you little gonk. If you tell
anyone what he said, I'll kill you.

25:20.040 --> 25:24.318
Drive, just drive!
Get in the car, get in the car!

25:24.520 --> 25:27.159
Drive, drive!

25:32.560 --> 25:35.711
Leave her, leave her. She's not
quick enough. Come on, sweetie!

25:40.320 --> 25:43.471
It's absolutely ridiculous stopping me.

25:43.680 --> 25:48.310
Look at the people they're letting through.
Stoned Chinese hippies with backpacks!

25:49.800 --> 25:51.279
Prescription.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.436
There is someone waiting
just out by that barrier there

25:53.640 --> 25:57.189
to get this piece of paper
to save my reputation and career.

26:02.400 --> 26:06.075
If he finds anything, Pats,
you're on your own.

26:10.080 --> 26:14.631
- Whose bag is this?
- This is my case.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.910
It's not my sponge bag.

26:18.560 --> 26:22.269
- Who packed this case?
- They did.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.551
You'd better come with me.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.239
- You don't have to say anything.
- I know.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.470
If you had given me this paper sooner,
I would have rushed home

26:40.680 --> 26:42.910
and I wouldn't be standing here now!

26:43.120 --> 26:45.714
It's not her fault we're here now.

26:45.920 --> 26:50.994
I don't think anyone quite appreciates
the scale of what is happening here!

26:51.200 --> 26:54.988
It means that of course
Bettina's apartment won't get decorated.

26:55.200 --> 26:59.079
It's the end of my career in
interior design before it's even begun.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.352
Buildings everywhere
might heave a sigh of relief.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.311
I don't know why I don't sack you.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.350
Don't be silly.
Where else are you going to find someone

27:10.560 --> 27:13.233
who makes doing nothing
into an art form?

27:13.440 --> 27:15.670
I'm sorry. I had to say that.

27:15.880 --> 27:20.431
It's alright.
I didn't quite understand what you meant.

27:23.920 --> 27:27.196
- Is no one going to speak to me?
- Shh!

27:27.400 --> 27:30.039
After all, I'll be the one
who'll be going to prison.

27:30.240 --> 27:33.949
At least you've got
your table tennis practice in.

27:35.680 --> 27:39.150
I must be allowed that telephone call

27:39.360 --> 27:42.113
before my freedom
is finally snatched away from me.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.709
That won't be necessary.
The powder we found

27:44.920 --> 27:47.150
was a perfectly harmless substance.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.033
- Oh!
- You're all free to go.

27:50.240 --> 27:53.277
- I beg your pardon?
- You're free to go.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.789
Be a bit more careful next time.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.040
Just hang on there.
I demand that you retest it.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.800
Come back!
I paid a huge amount of money for that stuff.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.309
Don't tell me it was talcum powder.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.874
So you've been diddled.
It's happened to us all

28:38.080 --> 28:40.389
- But it's not the money.
- What is it?

28:40.600 --> 28:46.470
It's the horrible realisation that
I must have enjoyed playing ping-pong.
