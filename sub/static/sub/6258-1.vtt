17:30.680 --> 17:34.810
but I may have
a, uh, situation.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.481
Hey, man,
tell me what's up.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.641
Maybe I can help you.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.165
I wish I could,
but with all due respect,

17:40.320 --> 17:43.210
your tiny brain is a lot safer
with my problems inside it.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.328
Hey, man, I seen a lot
between Honduras and here.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.448
- Try me.
- Honduras?

17:47.600 --> 17:48.601
You said you were from New Jersey.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.331
Oh, did I?
I am-- was from there.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.527
Anyway, hey, look,
it's a terrible thing

17:52.680 --> 17:53.681
that you're leaving right now

17:53.880 --> 17:56.008
because I just got
my upstairs neighbor hired.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.686
That's one more person
to look out for you, you know,

17:58.840 --> 18:01.161
like, when you take your naps
or you come in late

18:01.320 --> 18:02.367
or don't come in at all.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.171
Well, I do love
a partner in crime.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.527
Where is he?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.330
Right there.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.170
Right there. Aisle three.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.681
Ash:
Sweet musical Jesus!

18:13.840 --> 18:15.604
That's your friend?

18:15.760 --> 18:19.685
Aw, she's filthy--
and fine.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.604
She's very attractive, I know.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.888
Hey, I try not
to look at her like that.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.844
- That must be difficult.
- It is.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.203
She haunts my dreams.
Just kidding.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.521
She does, though.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.364
Well, I should say my good-byes.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.249
( Light bulbs popping )

18:40.040 --> 18:42.361
Nice day, huh?

18:42.520 --> 18:45.683
Just wanted to say I'm sorry
I have to leave you so soon.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.888
I don't even know you.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.611
And now you never will...

18:50.760 --> 18:52.046
which is fine,

18:52.200 --> 18:54.567
because you really never
could have had me anyway.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.403
Had you?

18:57.560 --> 18:58.607
Are you out of your mind?

18:58.760 --> 19:00.285
( laughs )
I know.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.408
It sounds crazy, doesn't it?

19:02.560 --> 19:04.847
I'm old, graying,
10 pounds overweight.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.729
- 10?
- Okay, 30 pounds overweight,

19:06.880 --> 19:08.086
but It doesn't matter.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.401
At some point,

19:09.560 --> 19:12.609
the thought would have
occurred to you.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.730
Do me a favor, will you?
Thank your mother for me.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.367
She passed her genes down to you
in all the right places.

19:20.560 --> 19:24.610
My mother died in a car accident
six months ago.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.927
Wow. Phew.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.445
Um, you know, in the future,

19:32.600 --> 19:35.604
you might want to just say
"Sure, I'll tell her."

19:35.760 --> 19:37.603
Because a bomb like that
on somebody you just met

19:37.760 --> 19:38.761
is downright rude.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.844
But you know what?
You're young.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.161
You'll figure it out.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.604
Good-bye forever, Kelly.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.201
Touch me again,

19:51.360 --> 19:52.771
and you're going to need
another wooden hand.

19:52.960 --> 19:53.961
Okay, wait.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.963
Another wooden hand
in place of my real hand?

19:56.120 --> 19:57.610
Or another wooden hand
in place of my wooden hand?

19:57.760 --> 19:59.842
- Your real hand!
- ( grunts )

20:00.000 --> 20:01.604
( groans )

20:04.960 --> 20:06.450
Touchy.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.681
( Door chime tinkles )

20:14.840 --> 20:17.161
( police radio chatter)

20:17.360 --> 20:18.646
Morning, GUYS-

20:18.800 --> 20:19.801
- Hey.
- Good morning.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.803
( Police radio chatter continues )

20:21.960 --> 20:23.325
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.164
Sure.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.845
( Chattering )

20:27.000 --> 20:30.322
(whispering )

20:34.800 --> 20:37.167
Amanda.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.800
I can't imagine
what you're going through,

20:39.960 --> 20:42.327
but you'll be back to work
before you know it.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.847
Yeah, maybe,

20:45.000 --> 20:49.847
if I can clear and Internal Affairs
homicide inquest,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.731
plus or minus a psych evaluation.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.087
( Sighs )

20:55.240 --> 20:59.290
I don't know.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.368
( Ghostly rumble )

21:11.400 --> 21:12.561
( gasps )

21:19.240 --> 21:21.891
(whispering )

21:26.520 --> 21:27.885
Are you all right?

21:29.200 --> 21:30.725
Yeah, I, um--

21:30.880 --> 21:34.566
I just--
just thought I saw something.

21:34.720 --> 21:38.406
But I can't really trust
my eyes these days.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.164
There's nothing wrong
with your eyes.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.203
Sometimes
what you think you saw

21:42.400 --> 21:44.767
is exactly what you saw.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.965
( Bell on door rings )

21:57.520 --> 21:58.726
( clattering )

21:58.920 --> 22:00.081
Mr. Roper:
Hey, William!

22:00.240 --> 22:02.083
Bing those bulbs back here!

22:02.240 --> 22:04.402
( Squeaky voice )
Okay, Mr. Roper!

22:09.760 --> 22:13.367
Hey! Man working here!
Lights on!

22:13.560 --> 22:15.244
( Giggle echoes )

22:16.240 --> 22:17.401
Who's there?

22:20.760 --> 22:22.922
( Giggle echoes )

22:27.760 --> 22:29.285
Who's there?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.602
Hmm.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.131
( Clicks )

23:02.800 --> 23:04.290
Hmm.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.800
Hmm.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.367
Hiyah!

23:16.520 --> 23:17.851
(grunting )

23:18.040 --> 23:19.769
Ah!

23:20.800 --> 23:22.928
Get off me!
Get off me!

23:23.080 --> 23:24.366
( Squeaking )

23:26.160 --> 23:27.366
Aah!

23:30.000 --> 23:32.321
(grunting )

23:39.720 --> 23:40.881
( laughs )

23:42.680 --> 23:43.681
( groans )

23:44.760 --> 23:47.889
( gasps )

23:49.400 --> 23:51.243
( squeals )

23:51.400 --> 23:53.004
Little Lori hate you!

23:53.200 --> 23:55.362
Aah!

23:57.520 --> 24:00.285
( Sobbing )

24:00.440 --> 24:01.521
( mock sobbing )

24:01.680 --> 24:03.967
You going to be okay?

24:04.120 --> 24:06.043
( Roars )

24:06.200 --> 24:09.044
Little Lori hate you!
Little Lori kill you!

24:09.200 --> 24:11.043
(grunts)

24:12.920 --> 24:15.207
Aah!

24:15.360 --> 24:17.362
No, no! No! No!

24:24.600 --> 24:25.601
Hi.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.649
<i>He'! '</i>

24:27.800 --> 24:29.370
What the hell was that?

24:40.600 --> 24:43.410
Let me
ask you something, Pablo.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.564
Do you believe
in the existence of evil?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.563
A force of nature
capable of giving rise

24:48.720 --> 24:50.404
to all things wicked?

24:51.920 --> 24:53.922
My uncle is a shaman.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.923
We called him El Brujo.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.641
And when I was kid
he would say,

24:59.800 --> 25:02.087
"Pablito, fear the evil.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.926
The devil is always waiting
in the shadows."

25:06.080 --> 25:08.447
Man, I always thought
it was the mescal talking,

25:08.600 --> 25:12.321
but after seeing this,
I think he was right.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.922
I'm going to tell you something
I've never told anyone.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.924
30 years ago my friends and I
spent the night at a cabin.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.600
We found a book--

25:23.760 --> 25:26.604
"Necronomicon Ex Mortis"--

25:26.760 --> 25:29.286
"The Book Of The Dead."

25:31.600 --> 25:34.126
Certain passages were recited.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.442
It awoke something
in the woods--

25:37.600 --> 25:41.650
something dark, evil.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.644
It got into my hand
and it went bad,

25:44.800 --> 25:47.644
and so... I lopped it off
at the wrist.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.282
It possessed my friends.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.321
My girlfriend, Linda, she--

26:02.640 --> 26:05.166
I was the only one to escape,

26:05.320 --> 26:08.324
and for the past 30 years,
I've been hiding out.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.642
And now,
because I screwed up,

26:10.800 --> 26:13.849
read from that book
one lousy time,

26:14.000 --> 26:15.445
evil has found me.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.843
That's why I'm taking off,
like, right now.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.729
Catch you flip-flop,
good buddy.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.008
El Brujo said something else,

26:23.160 --> 26:25.845
that only one man would rise
to stand against it.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.684
He called him El Jefe.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.527
I think it's you, Ash.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.364
You got the wrong guy.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.162
What?
I don't believe that.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.361
And neither do you.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.521
Woman on TV:
...at the Woodsman bar...

26:40.680 --> 26:42.364
Woodsman bar?

26:42.520 --> 26:44.170
That's where I was last night.

26:44.320 --> 26:48.211
...where a large sinkhole
has suddenly opened up.

26:48.360 --> 26:51.330
Don't you see that
it's happening all around you?

26:51.480 --> 26:53.209
You got the wrong jefe, chief.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.725
Hey, come on.
You fought this thing before.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.843
Maybe you just got to finish
what you started.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.207
You listen to me.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.522
Whatever I was,
that was a long time ago.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.529
Let it choose somebody else now.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.722
Me, I'm cutting out.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.689
You can't outrun evil, Ash.

27:07.840 --> 27:12.402
- Watch me!
- ( thunder rumbling)

27:22.240 --> 27:23.765
( engine starts )

27:27.840 --> 27:30.446
( tires squeal )

27:31.440 --> 27:33.408
Dad? Dad?
Are you okay?

27:33.560 --> 27:34.925
You're-- cutting in and out.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.411
- Something...
- What?

27:36.560 --> 27:39.404
- ...happened, okay?
- Dad, are you okay?

27:39.560 --> 27:41.244
It's just that, well,

27:41.400 --> 27:42.561
I came downstairs this morning,

27:42.760 --> 27:44.250
and you know that book
that your mom gave me?

27:44.400 --> 27:47.404
That god awful French historical novel
that I never got through?

27:47.600 --> 27:48.601
It was the table.

27:48.760 --> 27:49.761
And then later,

27:49.920 --> 27:51.410
when I came downstairs
after my shower,

27:51.600 --> 27:55.082
then the whole place was, like,
smelling like pancakes.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.967
Oh, my God.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.205
Someone's there.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.761
- Jesus.
- Who?

28:08.280 --> 28:10.123
- She's here.
- Dad, who?

28:10.280 --> 28:12.123
Who is there?

28:12.280 --> 28:15.011
_ Dad?
. ( knocking )

28:15.160 --> 28:16.969
Dad? Dad?

28:17.120 --> 28:19.441
She's-- she's at the door.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.444
( Door opens )

28:22.600 --> 28:24.602
Oh, my God,
she's coming inside.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.130
Oh, God.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.886
- She's here.
- Dad? Da--

28:31.880 --> 28:33.166
( gasps )

28:36.280 --> 28:38.487
What did you see?

28:38.640 --> 28:40.802
My-- my mother.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.962
But she died sixth months ago.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.322
She-

28:48.480 --> 28:51.165
- I got to get to my Dad's.
- Um...

28:51.320 --> 28:53.322
I'm-- I'm going to take you.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.007
Start the bike.
I'm right behind you.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.047
What are you doing?

29:04.200 --> 29:05.201
I'm leaving?

29:05.360 --> 29:07.840
No, you're not.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.331
( Gasps )

29:16.280 --> 29:18.521
( engine sputters )

29:19.680 --> 29:22.729
(whooshing )

29:22.880 --> 29:25.121
- ( cranking )
- ( grunting )

29:27.520 --> 29:30.000
Aah! Aah!

29:30.200 --> 29:32.202
Shit!

29:32.360 --> 29:34.044
Hey! I got this!

29:36.560 --> 29:38.608
( Engine roars )

29:42.040 --> 29:43.530
Hold on!

29:44.880 --> 29:46.041
Hey! Hey!

29:46.200 --> 29:48.043
You haven't finished
your fucking shift!

29:48.200 --> 29:52.250
Aah!

29:52.400 --> 29:54.926
(tingling )

30:19.600 --> 30:22.080
( door opens )

30:39.920 --> 30:42.161
( floor creaking )

30:57.600 --> 30:59.284
Carson's shirt.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.762
It did happen.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.766
( Tires squeal )

31:11.920 --> 31:14.002
Hey, I said I need
to get to my Dad's.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.161
What are we doing here?

31:15.320 --> 31:16.651
We're here to see someone.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.643
He's the only guy
I think can help us.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.689
- Okay.
- I just hope that he will.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.766
Oh, this idiot?
Are you kidding?

31:25.920 --> 31:27.809
- He can't help with anything.
- Relax, sweetheart.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.485
I'm not sticking my neck
out for anybody.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.325
In fact, I'm just about
to haul noogies.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.651
( Groans )

31:44.960 --> 31:46.485
All right, I'm out of here.

31:53.160 --> 31:56.403
( Ghostly rumble )

31:56.600 --> 31:58.807
( sighs )

31:58.960 --> 32:00.166
What is that?

32:00.320 --> 32:04.689
- ( Skittering )
-( rumbling )

32:04.840 --> 32:07.366
(thump)

32:07.520 --> 32:09.488
What the hell?

32:10.880 --> 32:12.644
(thump)

32:15.680 --> 32:17.682
(thump)

32:17.840 --> 32:22.084
( thumping, skittering )

32:22.240 --> 32:25.050
( thumping continues )

32:29.000 --> 32:32.368
Well, whatever this thing is,
it's found you.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.329
There is no more running.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.529
Are you going to own up
to who you are or not?

32:41.200 --> 32:42.929
I guess we'll find out.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.481
Kelly!

32:53.640 --> 32:55.369
( laughter)

32:55.520 --> 32:56.601
Pablo:
Let her go!

32:59.480 --> 33:01.721
Ash! Ash!

33:01.880 --> 33:04.451
- Do something, please!
- ( choking )

33:04.600 --> 33:06.443
(grunting )

33:06.600 --> 33:08.364
( Kelly gasping )

33:08.520 --> 33:10.602
Help me.
Help me, please.

33:16.240 --> 33:20.404
Whoa!

33:23.400 --> 33:26.370
( Monster shrieks )

33:36.920 --> 33:38.160
Aah! Damn it!

33:38.320 --> 33:39.481
( POps )

33:43.120 --> 33:45.122
Just leave us alone!

33:45.280 --> 33:47.601
Leave us all alone!

33:58.480 --> 34:00.050
Are they gonna get in?

34:00.200 --> 34:03.807
Oh, they're coming in, all right,

34:03.960 --> 34:07.521
and it ain't for Shabbos dinner.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.808
I need this.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.928
Yah!

34:16.960 --> 34:19.360
( Gibbering )

34:19.520 --> 34:22.444
(laughing)

34:34.639 --> 34:36.483
Mommy should have
taught you to knock.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.891
Thought I could hide.
What a joke.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.685
Who are you?

34:47.159 --> 34:50.164
You seem so... different.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.123
I told you
it would cross your mind.

34:53.280 --> 34:54.850
( Scoffs )

34:55.000 --> 34:57.002
Okay, but can we go
to my dad's now?

34:57.160 --> 34:59.208
Because I think he's
in some serious shit.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.522
Sorry, but your old man's
gonna have to wait.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.684
First thing I got to do
is a see a guy about a book.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.205
There must be
some spell I can say

35:06.360 --> 35:08.283
to undo all this.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.205
The other first thing
I got to do is some cardio,

35:11.360 --> 35:12.361
because my heart
is jackhammering

35:12.520 --> 35:13.851
like a quarterback
on prom night.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.081
You don't understand.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.208
My mom was dead,
and now--

35:17.360 --> 35:19.169
And now a whole lot more
people will die

35:19.320 --> 35:22.324
if I don't get to the bottom
of what's in this little baby.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.244
Please.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.890
Sorry, kiddo.
This ain't a charity.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.566
What we're up against
only understands one thing--

35:48.760 --> 35:50.364
- Vivian.
- ( shrieks )

35:53.000 --> 35:55.526
Aah!

35:55.680 --> 35:57.808
- Bitch!
- ( growls )

35:59.600 --> 36:01.921
We found you, Ash.

36:02.080 --> 36:04.970
It is time to test

36:05.120 --> 36:08.124
the mettle of man.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.806
We await...

36:10.960 --> 36:12.121
Await what?

36:12.280 --> 36:14.248
YOu!

36:25.400 --> 36:27.767
( Shrieks )

36:38.840 --> 36:40.649
- Aah! Aah!
- No! No!

36:40.840 --> 36:42.763
No!No!No!

36:44.560 --> 36:46.164
Pablo!

36:47.640 --> 36:51.122
No! Get away from her,
you fucking old bitch!

36:51.280 --> 36:53.328
(laughing)

36:53.520 --> 36:57.844
- ( groans )
- ( mock whimpers)

37:11.840 --> 37:13.888
Ash! Ash, wake up, jefe!

37:14.080 --> 37:16.481
_ Ash!
- ( groans )

37:16.640 --> 37:20.008
Aw, stop fussing, muffin.

37:20.160 --> 37:24.643
I just want to put these
through your eyes.

37:25.720 --> 37:28.405
- ( laughing )
- Jefe, wake up!

37:32.160 --> 37:33.571
Ash, the chainsaw!

37:33.720 --> 37:35.688
Ash! Ash!

37:42.600 --> 37:44.841
(grunts)

37:54.360 --> 37:56.283
- Aah!
- ( latch clicks )

37:56.440 --> 37:59.887
( rock music plays )

38:04.440 --> 38:05.487
( Kelly groans )

38:05.640 --> 38:07.085
Yo, Granny.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.241
( Hisses )

38:08.400 --> 38:10.368
Hope you took your Geritol.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.126
- ( Engine revs )
- Because it's time to dance!

38:13.280 --> 38:14.691
( Music continues )

38:16.400 --> 38:18.164
Aah!

38:21.160 --> 38:23.766
(laughing)

38:27.280 --> 38:30.443
Aah!

38:46.920 --> 38:49.241
( Rock music fades )

38:55.080 --> 38:56.923
You were right.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.411
No more running.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.251
It's good to see you, jefe.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.761
It's good to be back.

39:04.920 --> 39:06.445
How does it feel?

39:07.680 --> 39:08.681
Groovy.
