WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:13.767
Narrator: Coming up,
will Q be the hero

00:13.767 --> 00:16.033
of a special four

00:17.500 --> 00:19.667
Why is Murr keeping it
under wraps?

00:19.667 --> 00:21.233
It's cold out,
so I wore a blankie.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.967
And which losing joker
will be caught off guard

00:24.967 --> 00:28.833
in tonight's spur-of-the-moment
punishment?

00:28.833 --> 00:31.667
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:31.667 --> 00:32.733
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:34.433 --> 00:36.067
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:37.867 --> 00:40.600
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:40.600 --> 00:42.633
Joe: Larry!

00:46.333 --> 00:47.567
For the first time ever,

00:47.567 --> 00:49.733
all four of us will be competing
at the same time.

00:49.733 --> 00:52.000
We'll be sitting in a waiting
room among strangers,

00:52.000 --> 00:53.867
secretly trying to
make each other laugh.

00:53.867 --> 00:55.533
If you laugh,
you're eliminated.

00:55.533 --> 00:58.167
And the last man standing
will win.

00:58.167 --> 01:00.200
**

01:26.133 --> 01:27.433
2...

01:28.967 --> 01:29.900
...4...

01:29.900 --> 01:32.333
Representative.

01:32.333 --> 01:34.433
Representative.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.100
Erectile dysfunction.

01:44.533 --> 01:46.700
Erec--

01:46.700 --> 01:48.567
Erectile dysfunction.

01:50.067 --> 01:51.700
Call back.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.233
I'm sorry.

02:09.167 --> 02:11.767
Hmm.

02:11.767 --> 02:14.667
Hmm.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.400
Ah.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.133
Hmm.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.933
Sorry about that.

02:27.700 --> 02:30.200
Sexy selfie.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.300
[ Camera shutter clicks,
camera whirs ]

02:33.300 --> 02:35.067
Multiracial selfie.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.433
[ Camera shutter clicks,
camera whirs ]

02:46.300 --> 02:49.700
Excuse me.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.367
You guys all waiting
for a photo shoot, too?

03:16.367 --> 03:18.333
-Yeah.

03:18.333 --> 03:19.900
Uh, I write.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.167
What do you do?

03:21.167 --> 03:23.633
If anybody
wants my card.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.300
I'm a  doctor.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.600
I'm a good gyne.

03:37.933 --> 03:40.700
" doctor."

03:42.233 --> 03:44.100
And my whole bag of props
useless now

03:44.100 --> 03:46.267
'cause he pulled out
" doctor."

03:46.267 --> 03:47.700
Damn it.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.200
Have you been at your craft
a long time?

03:50.200 --> 03:52.233
Six years now.
I'm 40, so it took a while.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.433
There was a lot of school.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.233
It's been my experience,

03:55.233 --> 03:58.467
you never end up
where you started off at.

03:58.467 --> 04:00.300
Yeah, my degree
was finance.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.200
Finance?

04:03.867 --> 04:05.567
Sorry?
I had an accounting degree
coming out of college,

04:05.567 --> 04:07.267
but I don't do it anymore.

04:08.467 --> 04:10.300
I was a CPA for a while.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.633
Then I got into sales.

04:11.633 --> 04:13.833
-It's great.

04:20.167 --> 04:22.100
Q: There you go. Sal's out.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.300
Come on down!

04:27.700 --> 04:30.067
Damn it. Two dogs humping?
I thought it was --

04:30.067 --> 04:31.367
First of all, your ponytail

04:31.367 --> 04:33.367
almost eliminated me
from the walk in.

04:33.367 --> 04:34.667
I know. I saw that.

04:34.667 --> 04:38.200
Sal:
And then there were two.

04:39.433 --> 04:40.900
Uh-oh.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.067
Man: Hey.
Are you all right?

04:45.067 --> 04:46.800
Yes. I slipped
on the stupid pencils.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.333
Q:
Oh, you've got to get up and --

04:52.633 --> 04:53.867
Oh, Murray's out!

04:53.867 --> 04:57.100
Gatto takes it
with an ass to the face!

04:57.100 --> 04:58.800
What an ending!

05:01.067 --> 05:03.433
Narrator: Joe was the
"laugh" man standing,

05:03.433 --> 05:06.133
so he's safe
from the loser board.

05:06.133 --> 05:07.800
Today we're going
up to park-goers

05:07.800 --> 05:09.767
and asking them if they
agree or disagree.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.167
The catch is the weird thing
we're trying to convince them

05:12.167 --> 05:14.367
to agree with has been
given to us by the other guys.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.267
If the stranger doesn't agree,
you lose.

05:16.267 --> 05:17.667
You got kids?

05:17.667 --> 05:19.333
Oh, yeah.
I need this job.

05:19.333 --> 05:23.100
Narrator: It's Murr and Q
in a Joker vs. Joker challenge.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.833
Q: Ah.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.233
Sal: All right, Q, let's go.
Here we go.

05:27.233 --> 05:29.200
Hey, they drained
that fountain, huh?

05:29.200 --> 05:31.433
Usually, like,
there's, like, a fountain

05:31.433 --> 05:33.867
with all sorts of water flowing
in it and stuff like that.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.067
That's the
definition of a fountain.

05:36.067 --> 05:38.067
Let me ask you something.
Agree or disagree?

05:38.067 --> 05:40.067
Sal: Three best words
in the English language.

05:40.067 --> 05:42.133
Three best words
in the English language.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.733
"Mangle,"
"ding-dong," "turd."

05:45.733 --> 05:49.300
"Mangle,"
"ding-dong," "turd."

05:49.300 --> 05:50.700
Agree or disagree?

05:53.067 --> 05:56.567
But I feel like you can get
any point across

05:56.567 --> 05:58.400
with mangle, ding-dong,
and turd.

05:58.400 --> 06:04.133
What sort of ding-dong mangled
this fountain by draining it?

06:04.133 --> 06:06.067
My day's now a turd.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.633
-Yeah.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.667
You agree?

06:15.933 --> 06:18.600
Some ding-dong
mangled your day?

06:18.600 --> 06:20.533
Yeah.
-Yeah.

06:20.533 --> 06:21.800
So those are the three
best words, right,

06:21.800 --> 06:23.133
English language --
you agree with me?

06:23.133 --> 06:24.900
I'd say so.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.133
-Yeah.

06:26.133 --> 06:28.367
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Well done.

06:28.367 --> 06:30.067
All right, ding-dong,
I got to go drop a turd.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.167
I'll mangle you later.

06:32.167 --> 06:33.933
-All right.
-All right, buddy. Thank you.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.633
Sal:
Why is he in that?

06:38.633 --> 06:40.667
He looks like
a homeless superhero.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.067
I underestimated the weather.
It's cold out.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.467
So you brought a blanket
instead of a jacket?

06:45.467 --> 06:47.733
I have a T-shirt on.

06:47.733 --> 06:51.067
I look like Bon Jovi
in the "Steel Cowboy" video.

06:51.067 --> 06:53.667
Sal:
Yeah, but you're not a steel
cowboy. It's a steel horse.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.067
Do you even know
what a steel horse is?

06:55.067 --> 06:56.633
It's a horse, right?

06:56.633 --> 06:58.100
It's a motorcycle, dope!

06:58.100 --> 07:00.167
Ohh.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.067
Do you like
this afghan?

07:07.900 --> 07:10.200
Anyways,
agree or disagree?

07:10.200 --> 07:13.233
Gift cards are the dry hump
of Christmas presents.

07:13.233 --> 07:17.533
Gift cards are the dry humps
of Christmas presents, right?

07:19.600 --> 07:21.733
Nobody's really
satisfied, right?

07:21.733 --> 07:23.200
Do you agree or disagree?

07:24.300 --> 07:26.500
You disagree?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.167
-Oh.
-Oh.

07:28.167 --> 07:30.667
I see what you're saying --
like, right time, right place,

07:30.667 --> 07:33.433
right person --
dry hump's great, but --

07:33.433 --> 07:35.067
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.167
Don't you think
that gift cards

07:38.167 --> 07:40.367
are like the dry hump
of Christmas gifts?

07:40.367 --> 07:42.700
Who raises their hand
if you agree?

07:42.700 --> 07:44.067
Just  Okay.

07:44.067 --> 07:46.233
Forget it.
Thanks. Have a great lunch.

07:48.567 --> 07:50.933
It's cold out,
so I wore a blankie.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.933
Agree or disagree?

07:52.933 --> 07:55.067
She be stanky.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.167
She be stankin'.

07:57.167 --> 07:58.267
Right?

08:00.567 --> 08:02.200
Sure? Great.
See you later.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.167
Q: Wow.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.933
Narrator:
Everyone was in agreement,

08:08.933 --> 08:12.067
so Murr and Q are safe
from the loser board.

08:12.067 --> 08:13.800
Today we're at
Artevino Studio

08:13.800 --> 08:15.867
teaching a "mommy and me"
art class.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.600
While leading the class,
you'll have to do and say

08:17.600 --> 08:18.967
whatever the other guys
tell you.

08:18.967 --> 08:21.733
If you refuse any of it,
any of it at all, you lose.

08:21.733 --> 08:25.067
Hopefully, it's a-parent
that we're kid-ing.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.533
-That's not good.
-That --

08:26.533 --> 08:28.667
-You tried, though.
-Let's just leave it.

08:28.667 --> 08:33.200
**

08:33.200 --> 08:34.700
Sal, turn around,
turn around.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.500
-Yeah, back to the class.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.333
Just be seated there with
your head in your hands

08:38.333 --> 08:40.133
when the class comes in.

08:46.967 --> 08:50.433
Sal:
You can just sit anywhere.

08:50.433 --> 08:53.700
Joe: Get up, do that big sigh,
and compose yourself.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.867
Look at this little girl
looking at him!

08:58.567 --> 08:59.700
How is everybody?

08:59.700 --> 09:03.067
Sal, you are the teacher,
they are the students.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.533
They must bow
with respect.

09:07.933 --> 09:10.933
Is that gonna be
a rainbow?

09:10.933 --> 09:14.833
As a sign of respect,
we'll bow.

09:15.967 --> 09:18.600
-Yeah!
-Yeah! All right!

09:18.600 --> 09:20.900
Q: Sal, feel the front
apron pocket there.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.200
We put a little something
in there for you.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.867
Just offer some
to the kids.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.933
Loose candies?

09:32.333 --> 09:33.567
Oh, you're getting looks.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.367
Loose candies?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.900
Oh, this is definitely a heart.
Very good.

09:39.900 --> 09:42.067
Joe: Sal, you've been
talking about that extra
ticket to Burning Man.

09:42.067 --> 09:44.100
See if any of these
little kids want to go
to Burning Man with you.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.467
Murr: Here it comes.

09:49.467 --> 09:52.333
Any interest in going
to Burning Man?

09:52.333 --> 09:54.333
With me?

09:56.633 --> 09:57.733
Oh.

09:57.733 --> 09:59.267
So that's a hard no?

10:00.833 --> 10:03.067
So that's --
that's a hard no, then?

10:05.367 --> 10:08.000
Any interest at all
in going to Burning Man?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.033
No.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.733
-"No."

10:10.733 --> 10:13.567
-All right.
-Good.

10:13.567 --> 10:14.700
Loose candies?

10:16.500 --> 10:18.100
Hi, guys!

10:18.100 --> 10:20.267
This is your canvas, okay,

10:20.267 --> 10:22.633
and Mom's gonna be drawing
on her canvas, okay?

10:22.633 --> 10:26.500
Remember, don't eat the paint.
Don't. Eat. The paint.

10:29.833 --> 10:33.133
Don't. Eat.
The paint.

10:35.067 --> 10:38.167
Don't eat it. It's no good.
Don't eat it.

10:38.167 --> 10:40.767
I no eat paint!

10:40.767 --> 10:44.000
Oh, my God.
This kid is adorable.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.267
Do you think you're gonna
draw anything up here?

10:46.267 --> 10:48.533
Oh, oh, excuse me.
I got to take this call.

10:48.533 --> 10:50.467
Give me one second.
I'm sorry. My phone.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.333
It's your boss, Dora.
You're trying to get a raise.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.733
You're just not
getting paid enough.

10:53.733 --> 10:56.700
Yes. Hi, Dora. How are you?
Well, I got my check.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.267
First of all, the rate was too
low than what we agreed on.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.233
You know, I'm barely
making minimum wage.

11:01.233 --> 11:02.633
You're killing me, Dora.

11:02.633 --> 11:04.500
Good job.
Good job, buddy.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.800
No, you know what it is?

11:05.800 --> 11:07.367
It's just three years
I've been an employee here.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.533
You know, my middle name
is "Artevino."

11:10.533 --> 11:12.733
You know that. That's how much
I love this company.

11:12.733 --> 11:14.067
I don't want to go
this route.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.267
I don't want to go
this route.

11:15.267 --> 11:18.500
I have a competing offer
from Arte Whiskey.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.233
Listen. I don't want
to do this, okay?

11:24.233 --> 11:25.800
But I have
a competing offer.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.467
Yeah. You've heard
of Arte Whiskey?

11:30.333 --> 11:32.833
Look into it
and get back to me, okay?

11:32.833 --> 11:34.200
Bye.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.500
Great job. Who's drawing
another rocket ship?

11:39.500 --> 11:43.067
Sal: Oh, my God. The kid's
giving you the evil eye.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.333
Joe: Oh, I thought
you only had one here.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.067
Did you pay
for this one, too?

11:46.067 --> 11:47.100
I'm done!

11:47.100 --> 11:49.167
-So you have two kids.
-I'm done!

11:49.167 --> 11:50.833
You only paid for one?

11:52.667 --> 11:55.500
Oh, yeah. I didn't know that
they were doing it for free.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.467
Call Dora. Ask her why she's
giving away free classes.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.100
Give me one second.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.767
Hey, Dora. It's James.

12:02.767 --> 12:04.833
Yeah, I just found out that all
these people are here for free?

12:07.600 --> 12:09.167
Why you giving away
free classes?

12:09.167 --> 12:10.700
I work on commission.

12:12.567 --> 12:15.200
Sal:
Joe, strike a pose right now.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.933
All right.
When someone walks in,

12:16.933 --> 12:20.667
just go,
"Who vants to paint?!"

12:20.667 --> 12:22.633
All right.

12:22.633 --> 12:24.867
Hold it.

12:24.867 --> 12:27.167
Who likes to paint?!

12:28.367 --> 12:29.933
Ha ha ha-ha!

12:29.933 --> 12:34.633
Every time somebody comes in,
you say, "Who vants to paint?!"

12:36.167 --> 12:37.867
Who vants to -- No.

12:39.867 --> 12:41.533
That wasn't a student.

12:41.533 --> 12:44.967
Sal: All right. Oh.
Joe, strike a pose.

12:44.967 --> 12:47.933
Who vants to paint?!

12:52.200 --> 12:55.833
Yes, yes. First mommy and me.
I do the advanced.

12:55.833 --> 12:58.067
Oh.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.833
Keep having them look
all around.

13:15.067 --> 13:18.733
Sal: Joe, say to the mother
right there, her painting,

13:18.733 --> 13:21.500
"Oh, person with deformity?"

13:26.667 --> 13:29.967
Person deform--
deformed?

13:29.967 --> 13:31.267
Huh?

13:31.267 --> 13:33.233
The -- This person --

13:33.233 --> 13:34.600
Oh, this person deformed?

13:36.867 --> 13:39.433
No.
It's a dolphin, dolphin.

13:40.667 --> 13:42.800
Anyone have toothpick?

13:42.800 --> 13:45.467
Anyone have toothpick?
Toothpick?

13:45.467 --> 13:46.567
Huh?

13:46.567 --> 13:48.433
I have piece of gabagool.

13:48.433 --> 13:52.300
I have piece of gabagool
in my teeth.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.567
No.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.767
Use the wood side of a
paintbrush to get it out.

13:55.767 --> 13:59.367
Toothpick? No. Ah!
Gabagool.

13:59.367 --> 14:00.967
Teethpick.

14:02.567 --> 14:05.400
Gabagool. Gabagool.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.600
Toothpick, gabagool.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.567
Gabagool gone.

14:11.567 --> 14:14.600
Joey, go over to the fridge
and get your head stuck in it.

14:21.067 --> 14:24.067
Joe: Stuck. Stuck.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.700
Stuck.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.600
Gabagool.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.367
Gabagool!

14:31.367 --> 14:33.833
Q: She just gave the crazy
sign to the little girl.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.500
Gabagool!

14:35.500 --> 14:37.133
Here we go.
They're coming to help you.

14:37.133 --> 14:38.400
Stuck!

14:38.400 --> 14:40.700
Make it open so easily,
like she just opens it.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.633
Ga-- Oh, yeah.

14:47.533 --> 14:51.200
Hi, everybody.
Ready to do this?

14:51.200 --> 14:54.367
Aw. Excellent.
This is what I like to see.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.400
Q, go up behind the kid
in the green shirt.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.267
What's your name, buddy?
Matthew.

14:59.267 --> 15:01.667
Lean in
and just go softly,

15:01.667 --> 15:03.067
"You think you're
better than me?"

15:03.067 --> 15:04.733
-Hey.
-Yeah.

15:04.733 --> 15:07.067
What, do you think
you're better than me?

15:08.667 --> 15:10.200
Everybody thinks
they're better than me.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.067
Now, Q, there's a blow dryer
plugged in on the table.

15:13.067 --> 15:15.067
Go and blow your hair out.

15:15.067 --> 15:16.467
People ask me
all the time,

15:16.467 --> 15:18.633
"What's it like to
spend your days painting?"

15:18.633 --> 15:20.067
I got to tell you.
I love it.

15:25.067 --> 15:26.900
Go talk in one direction

15:26.900 --> 15:28.567
while the hair dryer's
pointing in another direction.

15:29.967 --> 15:32.733
Yeah, I just want you guys
to enjoy painting, you know?

15:32.733 --> 15:34.900
Joe: It's blowing
right in her face!

15:34.900 --> 15:36.300
Q: I like your use
of colors, honey.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.167
-She's pissed.
-I like it.

15:38.167 --> 15:39.867
It looks like
the honey bear.

15:39.867 --> 15:41.833
-Oh, my gosh!
!

15:41.833 --> 15:43.533
Oh.
It's on "cool," right?

15:43.533 --> 15:45.167
It's like a nice breeze.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.867
To your right, there's a cup
filled with red paint.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.467
Nice.

15:52.467 --> 15:55.133
And then grab
a big paint brush.

15:55.133 --> 15:57.900
And then I just want you
to pick any canvas you want,

15:57.900 --> 16:02.833
and draw a huge "X"
from corner to corner.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.100
I mean, it's not doable.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.500
I wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't do it.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.300
Oof. I think I'm just gonna
draw a red "X" on my head.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.067
You know what I'm saying?

16:13.067 --> 16:14.500
Oh, that's interesting

16:14.500 --> 16:16.367
because we just checked
the score board, buddy.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.067
You lost this episode.

16:18.067 --> 16:20.967
Murr: Ahh!

16:20.967 --> 16:23.233
Here's your
punishment, bud.

16:23.233 --> 16:26.500
Draw an "X" on every canvas
in the room.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.233
Look at
all these canvases!

16:30.700 --> 16:32.633
Murr: Welcome to your
punishment, jerk!

16:32.633 --> 16:34.633
Oh, my God.

16:34.633 --> 16:38.333
This is basically the w--
impossible.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.933
So what if someone pulls
the painting away?

16:41.933 --> 16:43.600
He's crushing dreams.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.700
Just answer me.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.367
-I don't know!

16:46.367 --> 16:47.933
These all sound
like Q's problems.

16:47.933 --> 16:50.800
This is basically impossible.
You know what I'm saying?

16:50.800 --> 16:52.400
Ooh.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.400
Everybody's looking good.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.733
Let's see each painting.

16:56.733 --> 16:58.433
All right. We're gonna --

16:58.433 --> 17:02.400
Oh, I like your cat.
Oh, I love your little cat.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.200
Oh, this is tough.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.200
What --

17:06.200 --> 17:07.967
Murr: Here we go.

17:07.967 --> 17:11.567
Sal: Oh, dear.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.600
No!

17:15.600 --> 17:17.400
Finished!

17:17.400 --> 17:19.900
-Oh!
-Oh!

17:19.900 --> 17:21.800
That's good.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.133
Murr: No!

17:23.133 --> 17:25.733
All right, bud, keep going.

17:27.633 --> 17:29.867
Sal: Oh, God.

17:29.867 --> 17:31.433
Murr:
Look at their faces.

17:31.433 --> 17:33.367
This does not feel right.

17:33.367 --> 17:35.400
That's two.
Six more to go.

17:37.633 --> 17:39.633
What do we got here?

17:39.633 --> 17:42.867
Joe:
Aww. How cute.

17:44.300 --> 17:47.067
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.067
Murr: Oh, no!

17:50.067 --> 17:51.267
Oh, there you go.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.467
Murr: No!

17:57.467 --> 17:58.733
No!

18:00.067 --> 18:03.500
Oh, that's a cute bear.
That's --

18:03.500 --> 18:05.333
Oh, my God.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.067
Oh, no!

18:09.067 --> 18:11.867
-Not the pig! Not the pig!

18:11.867 --> 18:13.433
Not the pig!

18:16.967 --> 18:18.333
Sal: Oh, my God.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.567
Oh, boy.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.933
Murr: Here's number five.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.533
Joe: Now they know
it's coming.

18:25.533 --> 18:27.067
Oh, my God.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.200
Murr: Oh!

18:28.200 --> 18:29.467
No!

18:32.800 --> 18:34.333
My life is horrible.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.533
Ugh!

18:46.433 --> 18:47.700
I've gotta --

18:50.100 --> 18:51.133
We got to --

18:51.133 --> 18:52.267
-Oh, my God.
-You get that "X" on!

18:52.267 --> 18:54.100
-You have to do it.
-You get that "X" on.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.533
It's a punishment.
You have to.

18:55.533 --> 18:57.067
You get that "X" on!

19:04.600 --> 19:08.067
Murr: Oh, no!

19:08.067 --> 19:10.100
Oh.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.833
Ohh!

19:12.833 --> 19:14.667
I can't even watch this.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.200
Murr:
This is the last one, Q.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.067
Oh, I got the fat sweats.
I got the fat sweats.

19:23.067 --> 19:25.633
I got the fat sweats!

19:25.633 --> 19:27.600
I got the fat sweats!

19:33.333 --> 19:35.567
I don't like me right now.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.733
Murr: That refusal
was a big mistake.

19:38.733 --> 19:40.267
You only would have
had to do one, buddy.

19:42.633 --> 19:45.267
Oh, I got to go puke.

19:46.767 --> 19:48.100
Hello, everybody.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.533
Was that the weirdest art class
you've ever been to?

19:50.533 --> 19:52.333
-Yeah.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.600
It's 'cause you were
just on that TV show called
"Impractical Jokers."

19:57.067 --> 19:58.333
What?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.167
Q: God.
That was the worst thing

20:02.167 --> 20:04.333
I've ever had to do
in my entire life.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.700
I still hate you.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.300
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.867
Oh, man.

20:14.233 --> 20:18.967
Ooh. So I guess anything can
happen on "Impractical Jokers"

20:18.967 --> 20:21.900
'cause Q just had
a surprise punishment.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.900
And I guess we're gonna
show you behind the scenes,

20:23.900 --> 20:25.833
although we were
not prepared for this.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.033
Oh.

20:27.033 --> 20:29.033
Here's your
punishment, bud.

20:29.033 --> 20:32.333
An "X" on every canvas
in the room.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.467
Welcome to your
punishment, jerk!

20:34.467 --> 20:38.767
Okay. I guess we're gonna do
an "Impractical Insider."

20:38.767 --> 20:40.667
Murr: Here we go.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.167
Sal: Oh, God.

20:42.167 --> 20:44.433
Oh, no!

20:44.433 --> 20:45.867
Q!

20:45.867 --> 20:48.067
Oh, that's
uncomfortable.

20:48.067 --> 20:49.633
So now I have to
go in here

20:49.633 --> 20:51.933
and explain to these people
what's going on.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.533
Oh!

20:55.533 --> 20:57.467
-Q, you get that "X" on!
-Oh, my God.

20:57.467 --> 20:58.600
You get that "X" on!

20:58.600 --> 21:00.533
It's a punishment.
You have to.

21:00.533 --> 21:03.233
Oh. Ohh!

21:03.233 --> 21:05.100
-Oh, my God.
-Oh.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.767
Q, you only would have
had to do one, buddy.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.567
It's enjoyable
to see you in this,

21:10.567 --> 21:11.867
but right now
it's past the point.

21:11.867 --> 21:13.433
Dude, that was the worst.
I feel like --

21:13.433 --> 21:15.367
I literally feel like
I'm gonna throw up right now.

21:15.367 --> 21:18.300
-Hello, everybody.
-Hi.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.400
I know, and I'm gonna
explain to you why.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.400
Because you were just
on that TV show called
"Impractical Jokers."

21:23.400 --> 21:25.533
We are gonna offer you
a real class.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.333
-Oh, my God!
-We got some things for you.

21:27.333 --> 21:28.700
We got some
art kits for you.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.233
How do you guys like
the surprise punishment?

21:30.233 --> 21:31.667
-Yeah, you're welcome.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.200
Isn't it fun
on this side?

21:33.200 --> 21:35.167
Yeah, yeah,
it's fun on this side.
It's not?

21:35.167 --> 21:38.067
No, it is, but I still
am mad about mine.

21:38.067 --> 21:39.633
We'll do it again.
Don't worry about it.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.533
I mean, we can make an audible
of this whole thing,

21:41.533 --> 21:42.900
just make this
a punishment for Sal

21:42.900 --> 21:44.700
and make the kids
keep  up the whole day.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.900
Oh, my --
Oh, my God.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.267
Stick 'em up!

21:48.267 --> 21:50.067
Don't -- Wait, wait.

21:50.067 --> 21:51.467
When we came here today?

21:51.467 --> 21:53.067
-It was not a punishment.
-It was not a punishment.

21:53.067 --> 21:55.667
Oh, God.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.067
Q: Oh, my God.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.267
That was the worst thing

21:58.267 --> 22:01.900
I've ever had to do
in my entire life.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.633
Oh, please. I hate me.

22:03.633 --> 22:06.667
Maddie.
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.500
Thank you for
no one punching me.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.600
Oh, here you go, buddy.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.367
Did you guys have any
suspicions that it was weird?

22:13.367 --> 22:15.433
I thought he was
just really artistic

22:15.433 --> 22:17.867
and having some, like,
inner turmoils going on.

22:17.867 --> 22:19.067
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:19.067 --> 22:20.800
But, yeah, no, I had no idea
what was going on.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.433
What about you?
What did you think?

22:22.433 --> 22:24.433
I thought he had
angerment issues.

22:24.433 --> 22:27.133
Well, I mean,
that might be it, too.

22:27.133 --> 22:29.400
Are you okay with it?
Are you guys friends?

22:29.400 --> 22:30.700
Yes.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.967
But you're a little mad
at him?

22:32.967 --> 22:34.567
No.

22:34.567 --> 22:35.667
Okay, good. That's good.

22:35.667 --> 22:39.367
All right. Wow.
I'm gonna go throw up.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.800
Joe: Right there, from there.
Go under the table.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.300
Just be like,
"I got to get this."

22:46.300 --> 22:47.867
Murr: I got to get this.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.600
Joe:
Just stay there for a second.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.300
And now just crawl to the back
table to see what they're doing.

22:52.300 --> 22:55.200
"Here I come!"
