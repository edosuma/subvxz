00:32.333 --> 00:33.500
René!

00:37.541 --> 00:38.916
René!

00:47.875 --> 00:49.125
No!

01:05.541 --> 01:07.333
René!

01:32.000 --> 01:35.541
Three people were killed
after an attempted bank robbery.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.208
According to early reports,

01:37.291 --> 01:40.833
at least one of the robbers
was able to escape.

01:40.916 --> 01:44.125
The suspect is a woman
between 25 and 30 years of age.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.583
According to witnesses…

01:45.666 --> 01:47.625
Sergio, come look at this!

01:47.708 --> 01:49.416
…despite the large police presence.

01:50.333 --> 01:53.625
Two of the deceased
were security guards at the bank.

01:53.708 --> 01:56.000
The third was one of the robbers,

01:56.083 --> 01:59.458
an unidentified 30-year-old male.

01:59.541 --> 02:03.000
The police are looking for a young female
of average height,

02:03.083 --> 02:05.416
brown hair, and thin build.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.708
The state security and police forces

02:07.791 --> 02:11.541
have set up roadblocks
on all roads leaving Madrid.

02:11.625 --> 02:15.250
They warn that the suspect
is armed and dangerous.

02:22.875 --> 02:26.250
We must find her.
She's got the talent we need.

02:26.750 --> 02:27.791
Our battering ram.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.708
She's the most wanted person
by the police.

02:30.791 --> 02:33.375
We shouldn't involve
someone so high profile.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.500
Four armed people. Three die, one doesn't.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.583
What more do you need to know?

02:42.666 --> 02:44.291
That woman is a survivor.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.291
And now she's a killer, too.

02:48.708 --> 02:50.041
That heist was a botched job.

03:02.875 --> 03:05.500
She clung to the ceiling like Spider-Man.

03:05.583 --> 03:06.708
Who does that?

03:18.041 --> 03:20.458
Instead of tying up
the officers in the parking lot,

03:20.541 --> 03:22.208
she took them in the patrol car

03:22.291 --> 03:24.541
and passed all the roadblocks
with the sirens on.

03:24.625 --> 03:27.458
She escaped like a queen,
with the police's blessings.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.583
That's art, isn't it?

03:30.666 --> 03:34.666
There's no information about the operation
set up by the authorities

03:34.750 --> 03:36.208
in pursuit of the woman.

03:37.125 --> 03:38.125
Look, Sergio.

03:38.666 --> 03:40.208
I just got out of prison,

03:40.291 --> 03:43.375
and I can assure you
I only met dumbasses in there.

03:44.666 --> 03:48.541
Brain-dead people. People with no talent.

03:49.833 --> 03:51.083
Not everyone has

03:51.958 --> 03:53.125
what we just saw.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.750
It's not easy to find.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.583
That may be.

03:58.416 --> 04:02.416
She may be talented. She is talented.
But that girl is a lost cause.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.708
That's exactly why.

04:06.916 --> 04:09.083
And she's got nothing to lose.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.500
That's exactly what we need.

04:20.666 --> 04:24.125
ROBBERY SUSPECT AT LARGE
THREE CASUALTIES

04:25.625 --> 04:28.958
If they haven't found her in 72 hours,
we'll start looking for her.

04:32.416 --> 04:34.291
-I'm going to the library.
-Okay.

04:35.625 --> 04:38.000
Get some pastries from San Onofre!

04:43.083 --> 04:44.458
Silene Oliveira.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.166
That was my name when this story began.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.125
When I was convinced
you could outrun pain,

04:54.208 --> 04:55.625
just like the police.

04:59.291 --> 05:00.416
Run,

05:01.291 --> 05:02.458
close your eyes,

05:03.291 --> 05:04.291
and resist.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.041
But inevitably, at some point, you stop.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.208
And all that pain runs through you.

05:24.083 --> 05:27.125
And you feel like there's nothing
you can do to escape it again.

05:35.916 --> 05:37.541
I spent ten days in hiding.

05:38.458 --> 05:42.416
Playing the images of my life with René
over and over again in my head.

05:45.583 --> 05:48.625
Thinking about how he never liked banks.

05:49.791 --> 05:51.791
And when we decided to rob one.

05:53.750 --> 05:54.625
And just like that,

05:55.208 --> 05:57.750
my pain got worse.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.125
And so did my sense of guilt.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.625
For leaving him there, all alone.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.208
Lying on the wet ground, under the rain,

06:12.541 --> 06:14.125
as if René could still feel it.

06:17.666 --> 06:21.000
And then I thought
I had to run faster than before.

06:22.541 --> 06:24.958
So that grief wouldn't catch up with me.

06:27.625 --> 06:28.750
And I didn't stop.

06:29.416 --> 06:31.625
Not even when I arrived at that dead end,

06:31.708 --> 06:34.583
where an army commando
was determined to kill us.

06:35.166 --> 06:36.666
At this point in my life,

06:37.166 --> 06:40.375
I was miles away from standing down
and making it easy for them.

06:40.458 --> 06:41.625
Take cover!

06:45.375 --> 06:46.458
Fire!

06:49.625 --> 06:51.666
This is a fucking rat trap.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.166
We have to block the door!

06:53.250 --> 06:55.041
How the fuck do we do that?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
The stove top!

07:01.250 --> 07:02.875
Tokyo, cover us!

07:07.625 --> 07:08.791
Fire!

07:24.583 --> 07:26.250
Arteche, destroy that door!

07:27.333 --> 07:28.458
Hurry up!

07:41.750 --> 07:43.333
Fucking hell!

07:46.875 --> 07:48.250
We have to lift the stove top.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.708
Three.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.000
-Two.
-Two.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.583
One. Now!

07:59.666 --> 08:00.708
Tokyo!

08:02.250 --> 08:03.375
Tokyo!

08:03.458 --> 08:04.375
Wait!

08:11.458 --> 08:13.375
Grenade!

08:22.541 --> 08:23.583
Up!

08:35.291 --> 08:37.583
Hey, chefs!

08:38.666 --> 08:43.125
Put it inside a piece of cheese next time!

09:46.541 --> 09:49.666
LISBON, PORTUGAL
FOUR YEARS UNTIL D-DAY

09:49.750 --> 09:53.250
When I was little
and summer vacation ended, I thought,

09:54.250 --> 09:57.833
"When I grow up, I won't have
to go back to school anymore."

09:59.875 --> 10:03.166
Now I don't go back to school.
I go back to something worse.

10:09.666 --> 10:11.750
Why do we have to give this up?

10:12.833 --> 10:14.916
Because vacation always ends, baby.

10:16.791 --> 10:19.958
But I also smile when I see you
in our neighborhood.

10:20.541 --> 10:24.500
And I'm happy when we stroll around
the streets of Madrid

10:24.583 --> 10:26.541
and have a beer in the square.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.375
We live like royalty.

10:28.458 --> 10:31.375
We spend our days trying to make a living,

10:32.333 --> 10:34.875
wondering if we can afford
to turn the heat on.

10:35.583 --> 10:38.833
You spend all day breaking your back
with those gas bottles.

10:39.416 --> 10:40.375
I don't care.

10:40.458 --> 10:43.958
And I spend all day
looking for another shitty job.

10:45.541 --> 10:47.541
I want to be with you all the time.

10:53.083 --> 10:55.291
So we need to rob bigger things.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.291
Because you don't want
to have money to buy things.

11:00.666 --> 11:02.375
You want it to be free,

11:02.458 --> 11:04.000
and that's very expensive.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.125
That's what I want.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.041
To be free.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.666
Why do we need to settle?

11:14.625 --> 11:16.958
If we don't steal,
our life is stolen from us.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.166
What do you think?

11:25.458 --> 11:27.583
I want to travel the world with you.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.416
I want to see you on a desert island,

11:33.125 --> 11:34.708
in the middle of nowhere,

11:35.208 --> 11:37.541
with a mojito in each hand

11:38.458 --> 11:41.375
and think, "Fuck, I'm so lucky."

11:42.083 --> 11:43.791
So if we're that lucky,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.625
we should make the most of it.

11:48.958 --> 11:49.833
Name a city.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.166
Very far away.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.958
I promise to take you there.

11:56.833 --> 11:57.750
Tokyo.

12:00.916 --> 12:02.458
Get ready, Japan.

12:04.666 --> 12:06.166
The first time I chose Tokyo

12:06.250 --> 12:09.666
was to travel with René
to the farthest city in the world.

12:11.041 --> 12:15.000
I'd learned that loving him
in different cities made me happy.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.416
Saint Anthony.

12:19.583 --> 12:20.583
You beautiful thing!

12:21.166 --> 12:24.541
The second time I chose Tokyo
was to change one life for another.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.500
They're using the stove top as cover.

12:50.625 --> 12:52.416
They've got a good shooting angle.

12:56.416 --> 12:57.708
And aim.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.583
Cañizo, Sagasta speaking.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.291
They're in the kitchen.

13:05.375 --> 13:07.500
Find a shooting angle from the outside.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.791
Sniper unit in position.

13:16.583 --> 13:17.791
Let's throw grenades,

13:17.875 --> 13:20.000
blow up their fortification and go in.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.333
Screw it.

13:21.416 --> 13:23.958
Anyone who gets close to that corridor
is a dead man.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.250
We won't accomplish anything
with a grenade.

13:26.333 --> 13:29.625
That stove top is made with cast iron
and I'm sure they fortified it.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.125
And what do you suggest?

13:31.208 --> 13:33.750
Sit here and see if they come out
to use the bathroom?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.541
We're going to drill through the wall.

13:40.250 --> 13:44.333
We'll drill a hole
and attack from the pantry.

13:44.416 --> 13:48.708
It'll take us at least ten minutes,
and time is the only thing on our side.

13:48.791 --> 13:51.750
We need to go in now,
before they come from the museum.

13:51.833 --> 13:52.958
Negative.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.583
Push harder.

13:58.666 --> 14:00.416
Get it in there, damn it!

14:03.458 --> 14:04.791
I got it!

14:06.458 --> 14:07.416
Done.

14:08.041 --> 14:09.750
Rio, can you hack this shit?

14:09.833 --> 14:11.375
I can. It's cracking the codes.

14:11.458 --> 14:14.416
It'll take at least 30 minutes.
Realistically, one hour.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.500
One hour?

14:15.583 --> 14:17.125
What? No, there's no time.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.333
We need the foundry workers up here now.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.333
Come on.

14:23.958 --> 14:24.833
First-aid kit.

14:24.916 --> 14:27.833
Bogotá. How long would it take
to cut through the door?

14:28.458 --> 14:30.708
At least 11 minutes,
if there's enough gas.

14:30.791 --> 14:31.666
We need to decide.

14:31.750 --> 14:35.333
When we cut, the system will block,
and I won't be able to do anything.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.208
Bogotá, go with the foundry workers.

14:38.291 --> 14:39.125
Copy.

14:39.208 --> 14:40.583
-You good alone?
-Of course.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.416
Come on, Helsinki. You can do it.

14:48.375 --> 14:49.208
God.

14:49.708 --> 14:52.458
Tokyo, how long can you resist?

14:52.541 --> 14:53.916
As long as it takes.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.791
Start drilling. Canalejas, help him out.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.625
Major, you've got no fucking clue
what you're doing.

15:03.708 --> 15:07.166
Captain, do you know
what we're going to do?

15:07.250 --> 15:10.416
Exactly what I say.
And you're going to zip it.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.666
What's going on?

15:11.750 --> 15:13.208
They're arguing, Professor.

15:13.291 --> 15:16.500
The boss wants to drill the wall
and come in through the pantry.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.875
Gandía wants to attack
through the corridor.

15:18.958 --> 15:22.583
Gandía is questioning orders.
Tokyo, that's his weak point.

15:22.666 --> 15:25.291
-You know him. Can you do something?
-Of course.

15:25.375 --> 15:26.333
Then do it.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.666
Hello, Gandía.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.500
How are you, sweetie?

15:36.208 --> 15:37.500
Did you miss me?

15:40.750 --> 15:42.333
Only at night.

15:42.416 --> 15:44.416
But you didn't come back for me, did you?

15:44.500 --> 15:47.166
You're back
because you felt like a traitor.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.833
You were an ally to the robbers
through a walkie-talkie.

15:50.916 --> 15:54.083
You lied to the CNI,
and thanks to that, Lisbon got in.

15:55.166 --> 15:56.458
That's why you're back.

15:57.875 --> 16:01.208
Because you don't have the balls
to go home

16:01.291 --> 16:04.083
and look your wife
and your son Juanito in the eyes.

16:04.166 --> 16:05.916
Shut up, you little rat.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.125
I'll come in
and wash your mouth out with soap

16:09.208 --> 16:10.875
if you talk about my family.

16:10.958 --> 16:11.916
No.

16:12.916 --> 16:16.208
They saw you come out alive on TV.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.500
I'm sure they cried, hugged each other,

16:20.208 --> 16:22.458
and thought you'd be home for dinner.

16:23.625 --> 16:24.458
But nope.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.833
You didn't even call them, did you?

16:27.916 --> 16:28.750
Of course not.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.250
What would you say?

16:31.791 --> 16:34.208
"I killed a defenseless woman,

16:34.291 --> 16:37.416
and then betrayed myself and my people
because I'm a coward"?

16:37.500 --> 16:39.375
Gandía, calm down.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.666
"Hi, Juanito. Do you know what, son?"

16:43.458 --> 16:44.833
"Daddy's a piece of shit."

16:45.958 --> 16:49.541
"Why? Because I'd rather get myself killed

16:49.625 --> 16:52.041
than stay with you and read you a story."

16:52.125 --> 16:53.166
What are you doing?

16:53.250 --> 16:54.833
Don't, Captain.

16:54.916 --> 16:56.416
Captain, did you hear me?

16:56.916 --> 16:58.000
"And tell Mom…"

16:58.083 --> 16:59.458
That's an order, Captain!

16:59.541 --> 17:02.166
"…I was always late
because I didn't want to fuck her."

17:02.250 --> 17:04.083
I'm talking to you. Captain!

17:06.875 --> 17:07.916
Gandía!

17:11.916 --> 17:13.000
Grenade!

17:28.583 --> 17:30.000
Take cover!

17:40.875 --> 17:41.833
What was that?

17:47.458 --> 17:48.791
-Rio.
-Rio!

17:49.416 --> 17:51.250
-Come back!
-Where are you going?

17:51.333 --> 17:53.958
Bogotá, we need you here now!

17:54.041 --> 17:57.083
We'll be there in two minutes, Lisbon.
Move, fuck!

17:57.166 --> 18:00.083
Everyone against the wall!
Come with me, move!

18:01.083 --> 18:04.291
Hang in there.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.333
It's okay.

18:09.708 --> 18:10.833
I've got it.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.458
Stockholm, status? Do you copy?

18:14.541 --> 18:15.583
I'm trying!

18:17.000 --> 18:18.416
I'm fucking trying!

18:23.125 --> 18:25.750
-Ramiro, are you okay?
-Yes, sir.

18:27.000 --> 18:27.958
Hernando?

18:32.500 --> 18:33.541
Canalejas?

18:39.708 --> 18:41.916
Torrecilla and Tosco, injured, Major.

18:56.541 --> 18:57.875
You got him killed.

19:00.291 --> 19:01.458
You got him killed!

19:04.000 --> 19:05.583
One casualty, Professor.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.333
It was an accident.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.208
These things happen.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.250
-Not here.
-Arteche.

19:19.333 --> 19:21.458
-What's going on?
-They're fighting.

19:21.541 --> 19:24.166
That buys us a few minutes,
but not much more.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.250
Arteche, calm down.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.416
Cañizo speaking.
We can shoot one of the kitchen windows.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.333
Visibility isn't good,
but one of the pantries is within range.

19:32.416 --> 19:33.916
-Stay in position.
-Roger that.

19:36.791 --> 19:37.708
Arteche.

19:47.708 --> 19:48.708
I got him, didn't I?

19:48.791 --> 19:51.208
-Did I get him or not?
-You got his vest.

19:51.875 --> 19:52.875
Congrats.

19:53.458 --> 19:56.083
Arteche! Two members of your team
have been wounded.

19:56.166 --> 19:57.333
Go look after them.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.500
Arteche! That's an order.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.250
You're doing great.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.416
Maybe the same thing
will happen to you two.

20:14.958 --> 20:16.166
Shut your little mouth.

20:16.250 --> 20:19.166
Because of what happened earlier,
on the rooftop.

20:23.250 --> 20:26.750
I understand that people say things
they don't mean under pressure.

20:26.833 --> 20:27.833
No worries.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.625
Not really. I was being honest.

20:30.708 --> 20:34.333
Well, I think now is not the time to talk
about these things.

20:35.916 --> 20:39.041
I decided to start being honest
a long time ago.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.708
What's gotten into you?

20:40.791 --> 20:43.916
Nothing. It's how I feel.
I want to be clear, Dani.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.708
Let me be clear, Manila.
This is a fucking war.

20:46.791 --> 20:49.583
I'm with Stockholm.
I can't be clearer than that.

20:52.666 --> 20:54.208
Are you in love with her?

20:57.041 --> 20:58.166
I'll cover you.

21:14.875 --> 21:19.083
Disobey me again and I'll put you
on your knees and shoot you in the head.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.583
-You're not answering me.
-I'm madly in love.

21:29.666 --> 21:31.250
-Come on.
-"Come on" what?

21:31.333 --> 21:32.833
We know each other.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.791
I know who you are, what you like.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.083
I know your dreams.

21:36.166 --> 21:39.833
The huge, three-floor techno nightclub
you wanted to open.

21:39.916 --> 21:41.750
You've got more than enough dough now.

21:41.833 --> 21:46.500
Listen, the thing is, Spanish-style clubs
aren't popular in Indonesia,

21:46.583 --> 21:49.333
but I can tell you
I've danced a ton with Stockholm.

21:49.416 --> 21:51.208
We even danced in a vault.

21:51.291 --> 21:54.083
Okay, what about the martial-arts gym?

21:54.166 --> 21:57.541
That's popular in Indonesia,
you can't say it isn't…

21:57.625 --> 22:00.166
But I can't spend my life kicking asses.

22:02.791 --> 22:04.125
I wanted to grow up.

22:08.083 --> 22:09.208
Tell me something.

22:10.291 --> 22:13.083
You've been in Indonesia
for two fucking years.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.000
In all that time,
have you ever had any doubts?

22:17.083 --> 22:18.000
Never.

22:22.666 --> 22:25.375
I get up in the morning,

22:25.916 --> 22:27.750
and I see Stockholm asleep,

22:27.833 --> 22:30.250
rays of sunlight
coming through the window and…

22:30.333 --> 22:32.666
my life looks like a fucking commercial.

22:34.333 --> 22:36.083
A commercial for cologne.

22:38.625 --> 22:39.500
That's not you.

22:40.666 --> 22:41.916
That's not your life.

22:43.375 --> 22:47.291
It's a different life, but it's his
just as much as the previous one was.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.291
One life can be made up of several.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.041
There's no need for this.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.541
Shut it.

22:56.791 --> 22:58.166
Keep walking.

23:12.750 --> 23:13.750
Is anyone here?

23:14.833 --> 23:15.750
No.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.833
Are you living with grandma?

23:22.875 --> 23:25.958
Well, it's just a safe place.

23:33.083 --> 23:33.958
Who are they?

23:34.458 --> 23:37.583
People in same situation as you.

23:37.666 --> 23:41.500
Potential members for our gang.
You're the first recruit.

23:42.625 --> 23:43.458
Good.

23:45.416 --> 23:48.083
I'll stop you
from making a fool of yourself.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.916
If you want to steal 2.4 billion euros,

23:53.291 --> 23:55.000
you'll get shot in the head.

23:56.166 --> 23:57.458
So stop talking about it.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.458
You get shot when you don't think.

24:02.208 --> 24:06.791
When you go into a bank barefaced
and act without thinking.

24:06.875 --> 24:10.041
But this plan is many years in the making.

24:10.125 --> 24:11.333
How many years?

24:12.833 --> 24:13.958
Twenty years.

24:15.958 --> 24:17.833
I'm offering you freedom.

24:21.291 --> 24:22.375
I'm already free.

24:23.208 --> 24:25.541
I can go out that door right now
and vanish.

24:35.958 --> 24:37.416
Why don't you?

24:38.333 --> 24:41.958
Because out there,
nothing, no-one, is waiting for you.

24:42.541 --> 24:45.458
Your life ended in the last robbery.

24:45.541 --> 24:47.541
I can bring you back to life.

24:49.791 --> 24:50.625
A second life.

24:50.708 --> 24:54.208
Or you can just linger on the memories
of the first one.

24:55.583 --> 24:57.625
What do you know about me and my life?

24:59.083 --> 25:00.791
Or how much I've given up to be free?

25:01.583 --> 25:04.541
All I need to know,
and I'm going to find out right now, is…

25:05.375 --> 25:07.375
whether you're brave enough

25:08.166 --> 25:09.875
to be born again.

25:12.166 --> 25:15.750
To live again, find love again, a family.
It's a yes-or-no question.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.458
Today is the day to decide.

25:18.083 --> 25:18.916
Now.

25:19.833 --> 25:22.625
Wouldn't he want you to be happy again?

25:35.458 --> 25:36.750
Who are you?

25:39.916 --> 25:40.916
Welcome.

25:46.250 --> 25:47.166
Come on!

25:47.250 --> 25:49.791
Hurry up!
Three lives are at stake. Let's go!

25:50.291 --> 25:52.833
The foundry workers are in the museum.
We're cutting.

25:52.916 --> 25:53.916
Good.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.291
Come on! Now!

26:16.541 --> 26:18.208
I need the jackhammer.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.166
Where's the jackhammer?

26:26.958 --> 26:29.166
Stockholm! Where's the jackhammer?

26:30.333 --> 26:31.166
Over there.

26:37.416 --> 26:38.583
Morphine.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.458
Give me morphine. Please.

26:43.125 --> 26:44.750
I know that look.

26:45.333 --> 26:46.375
First dead.

26:47.583 --> 26:50.083
Always stays in head. Turning and turning.

26:50.166 --> 26:52.833
It'll pass. It's the shock.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.083
Morphine. Please.

27:17.416 --> 27:20.500
Get ready, Tokyo, freshen up.
I'm on my way.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.500
People think true love
only happens once in a lifetime.

27:25.791 --> 27:29.708
What people don't know
is that you can live several lives.

27:53.375 --> 27:54.541
Rio, right?

27:54.625 --> 27:55.500
Yes.

27:56.291 --> 27:57.291
What are you doing?

27:58.208 --> 27:59.416
Stargazing.

28:05.875 --> 28:06.958
What is it?

28:08.166 --> 28:09.458
That doesn't seem like you.

28:09.541 --> 28:10.666
You don't know me.

28:11.666 --> 28:13.791
Look, that's the Big Dipper.

28:15.416 --> 28:17.250
That's the Ursa Major

28:18.458 --> 28:20.041
and that's the Ursa Polaris.

28:25.708 --> 28:27.708
Hacker and astronomer. How about that?

28:29.375 --> 28:31.708
The Professor has it all covered.

28:33.458 --> 28:36.041
Some people can read
the future in the stars.

28:38.291 --> 28:39.416
Do you know how?

28:40.250 --> 28:42.416
Well, I mean, kind of.

28:44.166 --> 28:45.375
Tell me my future.

28:46.916 --> 28:47.916
Really?

28:48.583 --> 28:49.416
Okay.

28:56.166 --> 28:59.083
Okay, so, from the star alignment…

29:02.541 --> 29:04.416
it looks like you're going to meet a guy.

29:06.000 --> 29:06.875
Is he cute?

29:07.375 --> 29:09.958
We'll have to check
with Andromeda's angle.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.583
Look. There it is. 

29:14.666 --> 29:16.083
-What?
-The constellation.

29:16.166 --> 29:17.000
Where?

29:17.750 --> 29:20.041
Look. Right there.

29:23.291 --> 29:24.125
Oh, yeah.

29:25.625 --> 29:26.875
What is it?

29:26.958 --> 29:28.375
He's a normal guy.

29:31.208 --> 29:32.625
A bit of a loner too.

29:34.791 --> 29:35.958
An average guy,

29:36.041 --> 29:37.208
but a good guy.

29:41.791 --> 29:44.000
I don't know how I'll meet him

29:44.083 --> 29:46.375
locked up in here,
attending Professor's classes.

29:46.458 --> 29:48.291
I bet Cassiopeia knows.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.666
Let's ask her.

29:51.666 --> 29:53.583
-Wow, that's weird.
-What?

29:53.666 --> 29:55.916
Cassiopeia says you'll meet him dancing.

30:20.208 --> 30:21.333
Can I have this dance?

31:35.333 --> 31:37.583
It's okay. We've lost one of the lances.

31:37.666 --> 31:39.333
How much time do we have?

31:39.416 --> 31:40.916
No less than six minutes.

31:48.291 --> 31:50.875
Professor, what was that?

31:53.916 --> 31:55.916
I've got to tell you something.

31:57.250 --> 32:00.833
There's one more of us
in the stormwater tank.

32:00.916 --> 32:03.708
Inspector Alicia Sierra
gave birth to a baby,

32:03.791 --> 32:08.083
a beautiful girl
weighing around three and a half kilos,

32:08.583 --> 32:10.500
and she's in great health.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.625
Congratulations.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.333
A baby is always a joy and…

32:17.833 --> 32:20.625
there's no surplus of joy
around here lately.

32:21.125 --> 32:22.541
What's her name?

32:30.541 --> 32:31.541
Well…

32:34.333 --> 32:36.666
I was thinking of Germán,
after her father.

32:37.250 --> 32:40.375
But since she's a girl, I've gone blank.

32:41.041 --> 32:42.250
What about Danica?

32:43.708 --> 32:47.333
In my country it means "morning star."

32:48.125 --> 32:50.208
You're a true poet, Marseille.

32:50.791 --> 32:52.250
If you're accepting ideas,

32:52.333 --> 32:55.500
I've always liked Lucía for a girl.

32:59.416 --> 33:01.541
I don't know if she looks like a Lucía.

33:06.208 --> 33:08.041
She looks more like a Victoria.

33:12.083 --> 33:13.250
Victoria.

33:14.916 --> 33:17.625
I'm going to name her Victoria.

33:17.708 --> 33:18.541
That's beautiful.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.666
That's it, Victoria.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.708
Because she's going to be
as strong as a bombshell, and so will I.

33:26.166 --> 33:27.125
And so will I.

33:28.250 --> 33:29.166
Take her.

33:30.791 --> 33:31.833
Victoria.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.791
Everything you bought is pink.

33:34.875 --> 33:37.000
Pink, because she's a girl.

33:37.083 --> 33:40.458
And? First of all,
there are no colors for girls or for boys.

33:40.541 --> 33:43.041
And second, you're conditioning her.

33:43.125 --> 33:47.291
You don't know if she'll feel like a girl,
a boy, or God knows what.

33:48.125 --> 33:51.458
She's not even a day old,
and you're already traumatizing her.

33:51.541 --> 33:54.583
Even the rattle you bought is pink.
Give me the baby.

33:54.666 --> 33:58.500
No. She gave me the baby.
You've lost your mind.

34:16.708 --> 34:17.916
Cover the door.

35:17.166 --> 35:18.333
The lance is out!

35:18.416 --> 35:20.166
We've got two lances left.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.625
Come on, hurry up!

35:42.541 --> 35:44.791
Cañizo, they're in the pantry.

35:44.875 --> 35:45.791
Tokyo, run!

35:47.916 --> 35:49.041
Fire!

35:56.125 --> 35:58.166
Tokyo!

36:16.500 --> 36:17.708
Tokyo!

36:29.041 --> 36:30.416
Tokyo, no!

36:36.708 --> 36:39.333
The day I killed Gandía,
the odds were against me.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.791
I was like a puppet riddled with bullets.

36:44.875 --> 36:46.625
And with five bullets in my body,

36:47.708 --> 36:49.250
I thought about my samurai.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.875
Open it. Don't worry, it's not a ring.

37:09.250 --> 37:10.833
It's a Japanese samurai.

37:12.958 --> 37:14.416
I found it in a shop window.

37:16.750 --> 37:17.958
It's a sign.

37:20.625 --> 37:22.541
I know what you're thinking.

37:23.416 --> 37:25.791
You can read my mind with a snow globe?

37:26.375 --> 37:29.375
You don't want to live the high life
and leave your mom behind.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.708
I already thought about that.

37:33.416 --> 37:35.125
We're going to give her a gift.

37:36.125 --> 37:38.291
A male stripper to spice up her life?

37:41.750 --> 37:43.375
We'll pay off her mortgage.

37:45.583 --> 37:48.333
If we go to Polynesia, she can go to Rome,

37:48.833 --> 37:51.000
or Paris or wherever she wants,

37:51.083 --> 37:52.416
so she can enjoy life.

37:53.791 --> 37:55.458
She deserves it too.

37:56.541 --> 37:57.875
And you need it.

38:00.958 --> 38:03.000
Where will we get all that cash?

38:05.666 --> 38:08.750
Ask it. Rub it a little
and see what it has to say.

38:10.250 --> 38:11.291
Let's see.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.250
It says that…

38:19.708 --> 38:22.791
It says you've already thought
about how we'll do it.

38:33.250 --> 38:34.166
Banks.

38:35.375 --> 38:37.791
We've already pulled off 15 clean heists.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.166
We understand each other.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.291
-We're good.
-The best.

38:43.375 --> 38:44.916
Let's go after the banks.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.750
You know it's higher risk, don't you?

39:07.291 --> 39:09.125
Hang in there.

39:09.708 --> 39:11.500
Tokyo is injured, Professor.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.333
She took bullets in her arms and legs.

39:20.708 --> 39:22.458
Fuck! The lance is out.

39:23.041 --> 39:25.583
Enough. Guys, go down to the foundry.

39:37.833 --> 39:38.666
Hang in there.

39:44.416 --> 39:46.875
Professor, we're out of gas.

39:46.958 --> 39:48.291
Help me, Lisbon.

39:51.750 --> 39:52.666
Denver, listen.

39:52.750 --> 39:55.000
We need more time to open the museum.

39:55.500 --> 39:58.916
Set up a defensive position
to cover any possible entry.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.041
As long as you're covered,
you stand a chance.

40:03.541 --> 40:06.250
We'll resist.

40:07.375 --> 40:08.333
Ready.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.125
Now.

40:21.083 --> 40:22.333
Fuck!

40:24.875 --> 40:27.708
You're not going in,
you're benched. Follow me.

40:28.958 --> 40:30.583
You lot, set up the explosives.

40:46.708 --> 40:49.083
Shoot anyone who comes through that door.

40:50.333 --> 40:52.041
Everyone else, take cover.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.041
Can you shoot?

42:01.125 --> 42:03.250
Until my arms fall apart.

42:11.833 --> 42:15.416
Manila, come on. Let's go!

42:25.250 --> 42:29.208
Professor, we're behind the trench,
and there's no fucking way out.

42:29.708 --> 42:34.875
There's no way out.

42:35.750 --> 42:36.583
Denver?

42:37.166 --> 42:38.666
Denver, the hole.

42:39.375 --> 42:40.958
Denver, there's a hole.

42:41.625 --> 42:42.916
The dumbwaiter.

42:43.708 --> 42:45.833
The dumbwaiter from the office, Denver.

42:46.416 --> 42:49.375
Denver, the dumbwaiter…

42:50.041 --> 42:51.458
from the office, Denver.

42:54.125 --> 42:55.791
It's right here.

43:15.583 --> 43:16.541
What?

43:17.375 --> 43:19.083
It's at least six floors.

43:23.291 --> 43:24.791
Fucking hell!

43:35.625 --> 43:38.291
Come on. Go down.

43:38.375 --> 43:40.125
-What?
-You have to go.

43:40.208 --> 43:41.791
Both of you, come on.

43:41.875 --> 43:43.125
Go down now.

43:43.208 --> 43:44.791
-What about you?
-I'm staying.

43:44.875 --> 43:46.083
-What?
-I can't go down.

43:46.166 --> 43:48.291
Manila, listen to me. Manila!

43:48.375 --> 43:50.666
I can't hold on to the ropes, okay?

43:50.750 --> 43:53.666
I need you to go down really fucking fast,

43:53.750 --> 43:57.041
and put cushions, curtains,
cardboard boxes, anything, at the bottom.

43:57.125 --> 43:59.750
Anything, you hear me?
Okay? And I'll jump.

43:59.833 --> 44:01.125
-Manila.
-No.

44:01.208 --> 44:02.458
Go! Now!

44:02.541 --> 44:05.500
Manila, go down! Come on! Go down!

44:11.500 --> 44:12.375
I won't leave you.

44:12.458 --> 44:15.250
You're coming with me.
I'm not leaving you here.

44:15.333 --> 44:16.833
-No, Denver!
-Let's go.

44:16.916 --> 44:19.000
-Leave me here. You're hurting me.
-Tokyo.

44:20.083 --> 44:22.375
Listen to me, please.

44:23.583 --> 44:25.375
My dad died in a heist.

44:27.291 --> 44:28.916
I won't let my sister die.

44:30.958 --> 44:31.833
I won't.

44:33.666 --> 44:34.583
Sweetie,

44:35.708 --> 44:38.083
I need you to save my life.

44:40.250 --> 44:42.166
-Everything's going to be fine.
-Okay.

44:42.250 --> 44:43.125
Okay?

44:44.083 --> 44:45.625
Go.

44:46.625 --> 44:47.500
I'm okay.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.708
-Explosives ready.
-Connect the detonator.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.333
Tokyo!

45:28.250 --> 45:29.666
Detonators ready.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.500
Tokyo.

45:42.458 --> 45:44.458
Tokyo. I'm here with you.

45:45.791 --> 45:46.625
I'm here.

45:46.708 --> 45:47.666
Ramiro?

45:48.750 --> 45:51.041
Hold on. I'm going to get you out, okay?

45:51.875 --> 45:55.166
-You're good at construction too?
-I'm full of surprises.

45:55.250 --> 45:56.208
Take cover!

45:58.458 --> 45:59.541
Tokyo, what is it?

46:01.708 --> 46:02.583
What's going on?

46:03.500 --> 46:06.166
Rio, they're here.

46:06.250 --> 46:07.125
We're going in!

46:08.250 --> 46:09.250
Manila, hurry up!

46:13.666 --> 46:16.041
-I'll open the gap.
-Rio.

46:17.458 --> 46:18.583
There's no time.

46:25.458 --> 46:26.416
There's no time.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.666
Don't say that, and don't smile like that.

46:29.625 --> 46:31.750
It's because I'm happy you're here.

46:40.458 --> 46:41.291
No.

46:42.791 --> 46:44.000
Tokyo.

46:49.333 --> 46:50.375
Come on.

46:59.208 --> 47:01.125
Do you know what I'm thinking about?

47:03.625 --> 47:05.291
Our first night in Toledo.

47:13.250 --> 47:14.666
When we danced together.

47:22.208 --> 47:23.208
Now!

47:35.750 --> 47:37.541
Professor, we're downstairs.

47:38.333 --> 47:39.875
Tokyo, they're downstairs.

47:41.291 --> 47:43.000
Resist 30 seconds.

47:43.083 --> 47:44.500
Mónica!

47:44.583 --> 47:46.250
Mónica! Fuck!

47:46.333 --> 47:48.666
Come on! Hurry up!

47:49.833 --> 47:50.958
Fire!

47:53.583 --> 47:54.583
Tokyo.

47:56.375 --> 47:57.375
Rio.

48:00.500 --> 48:01.666
Don't be sad.

48:03.333 --> 48:05.208
-Something is ending today.
-No.

48:05.291 --> 48:07.750
But it's the first day of your next life.

48:15.375 --> 48:17.458
You've got a lot of lives to live.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.083
-No.
-Lots of them.

48:25.791 --> 48:26.833
Advance!

48:29.333 --> 48:30.416
You need to leave…

48:32.750 --> 48:34.041
because it's party time.

48:39.458 --> 48:41.333
No!

48:41.416 --> 48:42.416
Tokyo!

48:42.500 --> 48:43.458
Fire, Arteche!

48:45.458 --> 48:46.500
No!

48:53.041 --> 48:54.000
Canalejas!

48:56.583 --> 48:57.583
Fucking shit!

49:00.333 --> 49:01.458
Fire, Gandía!

49:09.333 --> 49:10.208
Tokyo, jump!

49:10.833 --> 49:11.875
Tokyo!

49:11.958 --> 49:13.375
Tokyo!

49:17.500 --> 49:18.541
Can you hear me?

49:18.625 --> 49:20.541
Tokyo, there's no time. Jump now.

49:22.208 --> 49:23.208
Tokyo!

49:25.166 --> 49:26.916
You're out of time. Jump now.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.458
It's going to be hard.
How will you manage without me?

49:29.541 --> 49:31.541
I won't, Tokyo. Jump now!

49:31.625 --> 49:33.625
You've always been my guardian angel.

49:36.291 --> 49:38.083
Now it's my turn to be yours.

49:46.791 --> 49:49.000
No!

50:21.541 --> 50:23.708
I'm not the type to rot in prison.

50:25.333 --> 50:26.791
I'm more of the runaway type.

50:28.500 --> 50:30.291
And if my body can't run away,

50:32.041 --> 50:33.500
at least my soul can.

50:42.833 --> 50:44.041
Get back!

50:49.500 --> 50:51.291
Tokyo!

53:20.416 --> 53:22.583
