03:38.865 --> 03:40.254

03:40.254 --> 03:43.087
(woman screaming)

03:48.007 --> 03:51.424
(intense drumming music)

03:57.500 --> 04:00.083
(man grunting)

04:17.600 --> 04:21.333
- Pain is the only real
truth left in this world.

04:22.261 --> 04:24.432
(camera buzzing)

04:24.432 --> 04:27.432

(radio beeping)

05:35.853 --> 05:38.441
(dial beeping)

05:38.441 --> 05:40.538
Echo Base to Echo Leader.

05:40.538 --> 05:41.872
Come on.

05:41.872 --> 05:42.705
Over.

05:43.930 --> 05:45.143
Come in, goddamn it.

05:46.690 --> 05:48.780
- This is Echo Leader, over.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.510
- You boys are supposed to
protect my land from intruders,

05:51.510 --> 05:53.870
not become intruders!

05:53.870 --> 05:56.810
Apparently, one of your
highly trained soldiers

05:56.810 --> 06:00.440
has wandered into the perimeter.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.160
He's about to step on Havoc's toes.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.770
Oh, Jesus!

06:05.770 --> 06:06.900
- Yes, sir.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.540
I'll get him out of
there right away, over.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.243
(radio beeping)

06:11.243 --> 06:12.440
(man groaning)

06:12.440 --> 06:14.380
- Don't bother.

06:14.380 --> 06:16.040
The lion needs to feed.

06:20.247 --> 06:23.609
(chains rattling)

06:23.609 --> 06:26.276
(fire cracking)

06:32.622 --> 06:35.289
(ominous music)

06:53.777 --> 06:56.527
(metal creaking)

07:04.140 --> 07:05.840
- Echo leader, you're breaking up.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.940
I can barely hear you.

07:08.837 --> 07:10.065
(radio beeping)

07:10.065 --> 07:12.815
(Havoc grunting)

07:15.115 --> 07:17.070
So where do I go, east?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.490
Over.

07:18.490 --> 07:20.130
- Affirmative, go due east.

07:20.130 --> 07:22.000
Go fast and go quiet.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.367
Hurry, before he sees you!

07:23.367 --> 07:24.279
Over.

07:24.279 --> 07:25.671
(intense music)

07:25.671 --> 07:27.610
(man groaning)
(gunshots popping)

(woman gasping)

07:31.687 --> 07:34.526

07:34.526 --> 07:37.193
(jaw crunching)

07:45.022 --> 07:49.168
(man gagging)
(blood squelching)

07:49.168 --> 07:52.585
(suspenseful beat music)

08:03.102 --> 08:05.685
(gentle music)

08:37.866 --> 08:40.699
(camera snapping)

08:41.960 --> 08:44.793
(camera snapping)

08:53.152 --> 08:54.069
- Yes, sir.

08:54.904 --> 08:55.737
Okay.

09:07.132 --> 09:09.075
- What can I get you?

09:09.075 --> 09:09.908
- Diet soda?

09:09.908 --> 09:10.903
- Sure.
- Thanks.

09:12.540 --> 09:15.200
Hey, do you know a Mrs. Wallace?

09:15.200 --> 09:16.033
- No.

09:25.487 --> 09:27.559
(door clicking)

09:27.559 --> 09:30.960
(ominous music)

09:30.960 --> 09:32.303
- Hello, miss?

09:44.553 --> 09:45.940
- Hi, Miss--
- No names.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.300
No details.

09:47.300 --> 09:48.710
We'll converse outside.

09:48.710 --> 09:49.543
Follow me.

09:51.241 --> 09:52.074
- Okay.

10:05.835 --> 10:08.752
(foreboding music)

10:25.589 --> 10:28.236
(engine rumbling)

10:28.236 --> 10:31.486
(dramatic piano music)

10:54.420 --> 10:57.587
(motorcycle rumbling)

11:03.499 --> 11:05.323
(engine rumbling)

11:05.323 --> 11:08.240
(tires screeching)

11:29.640 --> 11:30.473
Follow me.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.710
- Where are we going?

11:33.710 --> 11:36.331
- We're about ready to
head up to the compound.

11:36.331 --> 11:39.748
(distant motor rumbling)

11:47.090 --> 11:48.380
- Who is this?

11:48.380 --> 11:49.540
- He's here to collect your phone

11:49.540 --> 11:52.760
and any other electronic
devices you may have.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.910
- I think for safety reasons
I should hang on to my phone.

11:55.910 --> 11:57.540
- If you wanna interview my client,

11:57.540 --> 12:00.913
you will follow his instructions.

12:00.913 --> 12:02.270
- Okay.

12:02.270 --> 12:03.490
Can I at least keep my tablet?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.980
It's a basic device reporters use.

12:05.980 --> 12:08.350
- And it's a perfect tracking device

12:08.350 --> 12:10.140
for any law enforcement agency

12:10.140 --> 12:13.010
to finally find out this location.

12:13.010 --> 12:15.380
- Okay, look, I get that
you have to protect him.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.213
Okay, I do.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.046
All right, I get that.

12:17.046 --> 12:19.490
But I'm just here to tell the story.

12:19.490 --> 12:22.080
I mean, you should know
that I'm no threat.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.470
- It's obvious to me that
you would like to propel

12:24.470 --> 12:27.540
your career into high gear by interviewing

12:27.540 --> 12:29.573
one of the FBI's most wanted.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.680
- Okay, but I'm a known reporter

12:32.680 --> 12:34.300
and I know that your
people investigated me

12:34.300 --> 12:36.750
before offering me this interview.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.950
- We did, however, we
weren't able to be certain

12:39.950 --> 12:42.600
whether you contacted the FBI

12:42.600 --> 12:44.730
or any other law enforcement agency

12:44.730 --> 12:48.350
that would love to take
my client into custody.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.870
I never wanted this
interview, Miss Weaver,

12:51.870 --> 12:54.430
but my client insisted on it.

12:54.430 --> 12:57.230
So I'm looking for any
reason, any reason whatsoever,

12:57.230 --> 12:58.920
to tell him we had to
cancel this interview

12:58.920 --> 13:00.083
and send you home.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.920
- So you give me no choice.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.470
- It all depends on how
much you value your career.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.033
Ambitious girl.

13:22.950 --> 13:24.423
Collect her electronics.

13:25.924 --> 13:29.174
(dramatic piano music)

13:35.540 --> 13:37.460
Echo Siren to Echo Leader.

13:37.460 --> 13:41.250
I'll be driving into grid
46 with the reporter.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.300
Do not shoot.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.460
I repeat, do not shoot, over.

13:44.460 --> 13:45.830
- Copy that.

13:45.830 --> 13:47.683
I'll alert all sentries, over.

13:49.660 --> 13:53.230
- And make sure the asset
is nowhere near us, over.

13:53.230 --> 13:55.020
- Don't worry about that.

13:55.020 --> 13:56.400
Havoc is occupied.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.567
(sinister beat music)

14:20.190 --> 14:22.857
(keys clanking)

14:28.676 --> 14:31.343
(woman huffing)

14:34.522 --> 14:37.189
(lock clanking)

14:42.974 --> 14:45.891
(woman whimpering)

14:52.533 --> 14:55.174
(metal banging)

14:55.174 --> 14:57.841
(woman huffing)

15:03.991 --> 15:06.741
(metal thudding)

15:07.969 --> 15:10.802
(woman screaming)

15:12.185 --> 15:14.852
(door creaking)

15:16.552 --> 15:19.552
(suspenseful music)

15:37.316 --> 15:39.816
(eerie music)

15:59.338 --> 16:02.319
(woman huffing)

16:02.319 --> 16:05.069
(metal thudding)

16:28.354 --> 16:31.187
(Havoc breathing)

16:40.360 --> 16:43.191
(suspenseful music)

16:43.191 --> 16:46.108
(woman whimpering)

16:47.150 --> 16:49.817
(woman yelping)

16:55.370 --> 16:58.203
(woman screaming)

17:00.485 --> 17:01.318
(Havoc grunting)

17:01.318 --> 17:04.235
(blood squelching)

17:19.647 --> 17:22.314
(ominous music)

17:56.352 --> 17:59.685
- Echo Siren, incoming with the package.

18:08.432 --> 18:11.265
(birds squawking)

18:40.670 --> 18:42.853
- We're gonna have to
change your clothing.

18:46.140 --> 18:46.993
- Excuse me?

18:47.940 --> 18:50.490
- My client is very eccentric

18:50.490 --> 18:54.070
and he expects you to
dress for the occasion.

18:54.070 --> 18:56.970
- Haven't we had enough
weirdness already today?

18:56.970 --> 18:59.623
- I'm sure there's something
in here that will fit you.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.940
- Okay, I am trying to
comply with your rules here,

19:05.940 --> 19:08.150
but I feel like I'm being
toyed with on this one.

19:08.150 --> 19:11.760
- If you want to interview
the extremely wealthy,

19:11.760 --> 19:14.670
you're gonna have to get
used to being toyed with.

19:14.670 --> 19:17.420
Now get changed and we'll
take you to see him.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.740
- Okay, well I insist on
having a video camera.

19:19.740 --> 19:21.680
Any small one will do.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.390
- You're pushing your luck, Miss Weaver.

19:23.390 --> 19:24.470
- And you've played your hand

19:24.470 --> 19:26.400
one too many times, Mrs. Wallace.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.370
Okay, I have complied with
every safety regulation

19:29.370 --> 19:31.190
and I am even willing to wear one

19:31.190 --> 19:33.789
of those ridiculous
costumes for him, okay,

19:33.789 --> 19:36.564
but when I leave here with my story,

19:36.564 --> 19:39.730
I'm gonna need proof that
I interviewed this man.

19:39.730 --> 19:41.683
Video proof.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.300
- I'll be outside.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.340
- And?

19:46.340 --> 19:50.213
- And I'll allow for a small
mini reorder but that's it.

19:54.060 --> 19:54.893
- Understood.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.970
(door creaking)

20:14.528 --> 20:17.111
(somber music)

20:23.390 --> 20:24.963
I guess I could get all dolled up.

20:26.114 --> 20:28.464
This interview's gonna
make me a star reporter.

20:38.186 --> 20:39.600
(Ellen chuckling)

20:39.600 --> 20:40.463
Let me guess,

20:42.680 --> 20:43.530
for security reasons,

20:43.530 --> 20:46.470
one of your men has to watch me undress?

20:46.470 --> 20:47.870
No.

20:47.870 --> 20:48.703
No.

20:50.485 --> 20:53.152
(Ellen sighing)

20:56.328 --> 20:58.490
Just deal with it, Ellen.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.937
Small price to pay for
an express ticket to CNN.

21:03.867 --> 21:06.450
(somber music)

21:43.717 --> 21:46.384
(intense music)

22:21.762 --> 22:22.595
(phone dial beeping)

22:22.595 --> 22:25.595
(dial tone beeping)

22:33.561 --> 22:36.978
(rapid gunshots popping)

22:58.993 --> 23:01.826
(solder groaning)

23:04.271 --> 23:07.188
(gunshots popping)

23:16.697 --> 23:19.614
(gunshots echoing)

23:27.241 --> 23:30.074
(bullet whizzing)

23:34.946 --> 23:37.779
(gunshot booming)

23:41.316 --> 23:44.066
(exciting music)

23:45.361 --> 23:46.502
(gunshot popping)

23:46.502 --> 23:49.419
(solider groaning)

23:52.374 --> 23:54.063
(gunshot booming)
(soldier grunting)

23:54.063 --> 23:57.230
(exciting beat music)

24:03.371 --> 24:06.204
(crows squawking)

24:09.700 --> 24:10.903
- What is this place?

24:16.260 --> 24:17.563
Have you seen this girl?

24:23.600 --> 24:25.073
Talk, you son of a bitch!

24:26.144 --> 24:28.977
(solider gagging)

24:31.080 --> 24:31.913
Shit.

24:36.026 --> 24:39.193
(exciting beat music)

24:45.189 --> 24:47.856
(door creaking)

25:08.470 --> 25:09.353
- Hello?

25:12.070 --> 25:13.420
I'm here for the interview.

25:17.271 --> 25:18.104
(man clapping)

25:18.104 --> 25:20.937
(lights fizzling)

25:35.850 --> 25:37.653
- That dress is fabulous.

25:45.492 --> 25:50.159
You look beautiful in it.

25:57.063 --> 25:59.250
- I think I look like a fool but

26:00.348 --> 26:01.330
it was the only one that fit me

26:01.330 --> 26:04.152
out of those ridiculous
choices I was given.

26:04.152 --> 26:04.985
(man chuckling)

26:04.985 --> 26:07.410
Your Mrs. Wallace is quite a spitfire.

26:07.410 --> 26:09.350
- Oh, Mrs. Wallace.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.210
She's special.

26:11.210 --> 26:13.233
Please, have a seat.

26:30.302 --> 26:34.840
- I gotta say, I'm happy
to see it's really you.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.893
- I can't remember the last
time someone said that to me.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.480
- It's just that I was unsure

26:41.480 --> 26:43.580
if the offer to interview you was genuine.

26:45.860 --> 26:47.043
- I'm not famous.

26:48.260 --> 26:50.340
- Not to the public, no,

26:50.340 --> 26:53.490
but to law enforcement
agencies and reporters,

26:53.490 --> 26:54.483
you're Elvis.

26:55.580 --> 26:56.507
Once your story gets out,

26:56.507 --> 26:59.840
you're gonna be headline
news all over the world.

26:59.840 --> 27:03.233
- And so will the investigative
reporter who found me.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.390
- Got my fingers crossed on that one.

27:13.728 --> 27:16.400
(camera electronic chiming)

27:16.400 --> 27:18.900
This is Ellen Weaver
reporting for Ottawa Iowa's

27:18.900 --> 27:22.170
leader in breaking news,
Channel Four Action News.

27:22.170 --> 27:24.840
Please excuse my attire,
it will all be self evident

27:24.840 --> 27:27.740
once you see the man
I'm about to interview.

27:27.740 --> 27:30.520
He just made the FBI's
Top 10 most wanted list

27:30.520 --> 27:33.120
and his identity is
shrouded in such mystery,

27:33.120 --> 27:36.543
he'sonly known to law enforcement
agencies as The Voyeur.

27:40.347 --> 27:43.280
Sir, thank you so much for
allowing me to interview you.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.370
- Thank you for allowing
me to explain my work.

27:46.370 --> 27:48.630
I'd like to take this opportunity

27:48.630 --> 27:52.343
to clear up any misconceptions.

27:53.190 --> 27:54.550
- I'll cut to the chase.

27:54.550 --> 27:56.960
Several law enforcement
agencies all over the world

27:56.960 --> 27:59.120
have issued warrants for your arrest.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.970
They claim you've
invested a fortune on what

28:01.970 --> 28:04.713
they described as macabre experiments.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.583
- That's true in a way.

28:08.490 --> 28:11.663
I did inherit my family's fortune.

28:12.660 --> 28:16.013
Their wealth was vast.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.260
- There's even a report
stating you used that money

28:21.260 --> 28:23.540
to stage the filming of snuff films,

28:23.540 --> 28:25.793
where actresses were actually murdered.

28:26.910 --> 28:29.333
- There were deaths involved,

28:31.773 --> 28:34.180
but I refuse to call my work something

28:34.180 --> 28:37.113
as loathsome as snuff films.

28:38.370 --> 28:42.590
They were true pieces of art.

28:42.590 --> 28:44.950
More than that, together they were

28:44.950 --> 28:49.017
the most honest expression of
humanity that I've ever seen.

28:50.420 --> 28:52.295
And of nature, too.

28:52.295 --> 28:55.695
(camera buzzing)

28:55.695 --> 28:57.287
(intense music)
(woman gasping)

28:57.287 --> 29:00.037
(sinister music)

29:01.219 --> 29:02.690
(blood squelching)

29:02.690 --> 29:05.080
(woman screaming)

29:05.080 --> 29:07.208
(Havoc grunting)

29:07.208 --> 29:10.079
(bone crunching)

29:10.079 --> 29:10.912
(camera buzzing)

29:10.912 --> 29:12.480
(woman screaming)

29:12.480 --> 29:14.980
(eerie music)

29:17.414 --> 29:20.301
(woman screaming)

29:20.301 --> 29:23.560
(hammer thudding)

29:23.560 --> 29:26.310
- So you're confirming your
involvement in the snuff...

29:27.520 --> 29:28.353
Excuse me,

29:29.270 --> 29:31.250
performance pieces

29:31.250 --> 29:33.683
where actresses were
actually murdered on film?

29:34.641 --> 29:37.792
- There may be some that
could see it that way.

29:37.792 --> 29:41.350
- Look, I didn't come all
this way and risk everything

29:41.350 --> 29:43.260
just for vague answers.

29:43.260 --> 29:45.620
But you said you wanted
your story to be told

29:45.620 --> 29:47.541
and I'm here to tell it.

29:47.541 --> 29:49.823
But I'm gonna need straight answers.

29:49.823 --> 29:53.820
- Oh, so you want to do surface reporting?

29:53.820 --> 29:55.340
That's not gonna work.

29:55.340 --> 29:58.350
If you want someone to believe
you, you have to dig deep.

29:58.350 --> 29:59.743
I have a question for you.

30:01.358 --> 30:02.673
- That's not why I'm here.

30:02.673 --> 30:05.633
I came a long way to ask you questions.

30:05.633 --> 30:07.373
- What do you want out of life?

30:11.090 --> 30:12.360
- Happiness?

30:12.360 --> 30:14.530
Is that what I'm supposed to say?

30:14.530 --> 30:15.660
- Sure.

30:15.660 --> 30:17.830
Doesn't everyone want happiness?

30:17.830 --> 30:18.663
- Suppose so.

30:20.829 --> 30:22.867
- Almost everyone.

30:22.867 --> 30:24.300
- Let me guess.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.753
Everyone but you, right?

30:26.810 --> 30:28.550
What do you want?

30:28.550 --> 30:29.383
- Truth.

30:30.894 --> 30:33.543
But there isn't much
happiness in the truth.

30:34.850 --> 30:37.640
- Okay, we can go down this road.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.823
Why not strive for happiness
like the rest of us?

30:41.950 --> 30:43.153
- Truth is cold.

30:46.140 --> 30:48.550
It's fear, pain.

30:48.550 --> 30:52.470
Truth is knowing that we all
are going to die someday.

30:52.470 --> 30:54.550
And that light at the end of the tunnel

30:55.390 --> 30:57.473
is not a gateway to heaven.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.930
It's a hallucination

31:01.360 --> 31:02.660
that is caused

31:03.700 --> 31:05.740
by a flood of endorphins

31:07.400 --> 31:12.400
created to help us give up the fight.

31:14.640 --> 31:19.523
And to help us give in
the the sweet goodnight.

31:21.210 --> 31:25.260
Truth is realizing that if God did exist,

31:25.260 --> 31:26.880
he would be ashamed of us

31:26.880 --> 31:30.960
for being a bunch of self-serving apes

31:30.960 --> 31:34.340
that only care about accumulating wealth.

31:34.340 --> 31:36.830
The fact of the matter
is, those young women

31:36.830 --> 31:39.123
that participated in our films,

31:40.000 --> 31:44.043
they experienced something
that few of us ever will.

31:45.110 --> 31:48.060
They saw and they knew

31:48.060 --> 31:51.240
the truth to our existence.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.913
The real truth before they died.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.040
They were able to see

31:59.920 --> 32:03.450
the fury of nature itself
and because of that,

32:03.450 --> 32:05.863
they were edified to the fullest.

32:07.190 --> 32:09.753
- But they had to die to
receive that edification?

32:11.270 --> 32:13.901
How do you lure these actresses
to your film shoots anyway?

32:13.901 --> 32:15.067
(radio buzzing)

32:15.067 --> 32:17.734
(ominous music)

32:19.520 --> 32:20.980
I'm assuming they're not made aware

32:20.980 --> 32:22.823
of the reality of the situation.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.693
- Most of them wanted to be celebrities.

32:28.239 --> 32:30.989
(water dripping)

32:34.073 --> 32:36.740
(ominous music)

32:41.520 --> 32:44.874
Not really artists, if
you know what I mean.

32:44.874 --> 32:45.707
(electrical fizzling)

32:45.707 --> 32:47.070
- I wanted to congratulate you all

32:47.070 --> 32:49.090
for being chosen for Terror Mountain.

32:49.090 --> 32:52.580
It is the ultimate horror reality TV show

32:52.580 --> 32:54.370
and whoever wins this show

32:54.370 --> 32:56.915
gets the million dollars cash prize.

32:56.915 --> 32:58.240
(foreboding music)

32:58.240 --> 33:02.493
There are cameras everywhere
and they're constantly rolling.

33:03.469 --> 33:06.219
(sinister music)

33:15.440 --> 33:17.690
(liquid trickling)

33:17.690 --> 33:19.545
(unsettling music)

33:19.545 --> 33:21.435
(bone crunching)

33:21.435 --> 33:24.567
(woman whimpering)

33:24.567 --> 33:27.091
(Havoc grunting)

33:27.091 --> 33:29.674
(woman crying)

33:33.008 --> 33:35.100
- And since they only
wanted fame and fortune

33:35.100 --> 33:37.795
it was easy to convince them.

33:37.795 --> 33:40.149
(foreboding music)

33:40.149 --> 33:40.982
(slice squelching)

33:40.982 --> 33:43.565
(woman crying)

33:47.673 --> 33:50.423
(camera buzzing)

33:53.706 --> 33:55.749
(Havoc grunting)

33:55.749 --> 33:58.666
(blood squelching)

34:08.130 --> 34:11.063
Greed and pride are deadly sins.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.060
- So is murder.

34:14.060 --> 34:15.093
- You mean wrath.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.813
And one day I will pay for
my sins in the same way.

34:21.140 --> 34:24.270
The point is, we offered them money,

34:24.270 --> 34:29.270
we made sure they didn't
have any fathers or husbands.

34:30.720 --> 34:31.853
It was easy.

34:34.610 --> 34:37.570
- You mention fathers.

34:37.570 --> 34:40.120
Do you think your father turned
you into the type of person

34:40.120 --> 34:41.680
who would do these things?

34:41.680 --> 34:43.123
- Are you a reporter?

34:44.370 --> 34:46.953
Or are you a psychotherapist?

34:48.430 --> 34:49.853
- Maybe a little of both.

34:50.950 --> 34:52.680
Tell me about your father.

34:52.680 --> 34:53.583
About his wealth.

34:54.580 --> 34:55.900
- I will.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.390
But if we are going to get personal,

34:58.390 --> 35:00.927
I need you to tell me about yours first.

35:00.927 --> 35:02.790
- I don't have one.

35:02.790 --> 35:05.950
- Do you want to get
personal with this interview

35:06.910 --> 35:09.040
that's gonna make your career?

35:09.040 --> 35:12.300
If you do, do it, get personal.

35:12.300 --> 35:17.300
We all know that the subject
of fathers can get complicated.

35:17.530 --> 35:19.680
When was the last time
you saw your father?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.967
What was your strongest memory of him?

35:34.560 --> 35:35.600
- When my parents divorced,

35:35.600 --> 35:38.170
I went from having a
father to wanting one.

35:38.170 --> 35:42.610
Okay, I would wait every day
for a phone call from him.

35:42.610 --> 35:44.560
His calls were so rare
it was like Christmas

35:44.560 --> 35:46.310
when he finally did bother to call.

35:47.294 --> 35:49.794
I grabbed that phone like
I was opening a present.

35:51.140 --> 35:53.383
For a moment, I was happy.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.850
But then the disappointment set in because

35:57.850 --> 36:00.120
he would just complain about how my mom

36:00.120 --> 36:03.010
was the reason we were
apart, how horrible she was,

36:03.010 --> 36:05.823
very little about me until,

36:07.340 --> 36:10.270
as time passed, the calls
became less frequent until

36:10.270 --> 36:12.263
they finally stopped all together.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.613
I heard he started a new family.

36:21.530 --> 36:22.363
How's that?

36:25.360 --> 36:27.830
Personal enough for you?

36:27.830 --> 36:29.563
Tell me about your father.

36:30.460 --> 36:31.793
- He was always there.

36:33.020 --> 36:37.912
He showed me that most people
are as worthless as cattle

36:37.912 --> 36:39.983
and could be treated as such.

36:44.780 --> 36:48.090
- On the topic of fathers,
you said you lure in actresses

36:48.090 --> 36:50.660
who don't have fathers or husbands.

36:50.660 --> 36:51.880
Hell, I'm not married

36:51.880 --> 36:54.073
and you knew I didn't
have a father, didn't you?

36:55.500 --> 36:59.430
- We were very thorough in
our investigation of you

36:59.430 --> 37:03.543
before we offered the interview.

37:07.628 --> 37:10.860
- When was the last time one
of these films were made?

37:10.860 --> 37:12.423
- There is no last time.

37:15.350 --> 37:18.440
In fact, we have a couple
of aspiring actresses

37:18.440 --> 37:23.363
right now on the compound
waiting to be stars.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.803
- So you admit to these things?

37:29.920 --> 37:33.310
- About a decade ago, I
found myself in a prison cell

37:34.870 --> 37:39.690
in some godforsaken place in this world.

37:39.690 --> 37:42.033
And before I even knew
what I was looking at,

37:43.930 --> 37:46.600
in a cell across from mine

37:48.610 --> 37:49.583
I found it.

37:50.910 --> 37:52.600
- Found what?

37:52.600 --> 37:54.973
- It was just pacing in its cell.

37:55.820 --> 37:57.820
Back and forth.

37:57.820 --> 38:02.443
It didn't even understand
why it wasn't allowed out.

38:03.300 --> 38:06.270
It was just pacing back and forth

38:06.270 --> 38:09.343
and I watched and I was consumed by it,

38:11.884 --> 38:13.980
and its eyes were black,

38:13.980 --> 38:16.790
all black, like a shark's,

38:16.790 --> 38:19.140
but I knew there was
something else in these eyes

38:19.140 --> 38:21.540
and so I just waited and watched.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.213
And then I saw it.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.023
It was the truth.

38:26.940 --> 38:31.010
There is no lying in these eyes.

38:31.010 --> 38:32.280
It simply...

38:34.350 --> 38:35.183
was.

38:36.580 --> 38:37.663
Like a storm.

38:38.960 --> 38:43.960
And suddenly everything
in my life made sense

38:44.610 --> 38:48.620
and I was able, at the
moment, to start seeing

38:51.240 --> 38:54.550
the truth in our existence

38:55.580 --> 38:57.023
and of what we are.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.360
- You keep saying it.

39:00.360 --> 39:03.063
Are you referring to a creature or a man?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.260
- It was just a force of nature.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.720
Still is.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.493
I used to be afraid of
death, but now, with Havoc,

39:11.950 --> 39:13.956
I control death.

39:13.956 --> 39:15.832
(sinister music)

39:15.832 --> 39:18.332
(man moaning)

39:20.340 --> 39:23.764
(meat crunching)

39:23.764 --> 39:25.588
I am its master.

39:25.588 --> 39:28.588
(chainsaw rumbling)

39:31.731 --> 39:34.231
(man yelling)

39:36.403 --> 39:39.140
(blood squelching)

39:39.140 --> 39:43.100
Like Beethoven was able to create

39:43.100 --> 39:45.530
such works with great beauty,

39:45.530 --> 39:50.491
Havoc can destroy with the same finesse.

39:50.491 --> 39:51.352
(ominous music)

39:51.352 --> 39:53.590
(blood squelching)

39:53.590 --> 39:54.463
- Havoc?

39:56.830 --> 40:00.250
Are you being poetic or is
that the prisoner's name?

40:00.250 --> 40:02.150
- No, that's just what the guards

40:02.150 --> 40:04.390
here at the compound call it.

40:04.390 --> 40:08.590
It's prisoner number A-Y-O-8-8-6.

40:08.590 --> 40:10.880
I don't know anything more than that.

40:10.880 --> 40:14.270
All I knew was that I
needed to set him free.

40:14.270 --> 40:18.020
So as soon as my lawyer
got me out of prison,

40:18.020 --> 40:21.600
I went right back, bribed
the Warden to release

40:21.600 --> 40:24.990
prisoner number A-Y-O-8-8-6

40:26.490 --> 40:27.633
into my custody.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.313
- And?

40:31.290 --> 40:34.010
- And Havoc came with me.

40:34.010 --> 40:36.927
And he has escaped from
me from time to time.

40:36.927 --> 40:38.790
(water trickling)

40:38.790 --> 40:39.623
(rock thudding)

40:39.623 --> 40:42.540
(gunshots popping)

40:43.524 --> 40:45.364
- No!
(machete slicing)

40:45.364 --> 40:48.197
(blood trickling)

40:50.127 --> 40:51.560
(electrical fizzling)

40:51.560 --> 40:54.227
(ominous music)

40:58.247 --> 41:00.997
(Havoc groaning)

41:06.890 --> 41:10.740
- As of now and over
the last several years,

41:10.740 --> 41:12.203
he's been under my care.

41:17.190 --> 41:21.570
- Does Havoc star in your snuff films?

41:21.570 --> 41:24.880
- Oh there you go with the
same slip of the tongue.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.913
I'm starting to take offense.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.570
- No offense intended.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.553
- It's my life's work!

41:35.490 --> 41:38.763
To answer your question,
Havoc is the star of my films.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.833
- Is he the executioner?

41:46.210 --> 41:49.063
Does he kill the actresses?

41:50.150 --> 41:53.853
- Havoc kills anything in its path.

41:55.631 --> 41:57.500
(foreboding music)

41:57.500 --> 41:59.100
I carry a gun.

41:59.100 --> 42:03.833
I sleep with one under my
pillow at night just in case.

42:09.727 --> 42:12.180
- I think I have everything I need.

42:12.180 --> 42:14.310
Thank you so much, I should be going.

42:14.310 --> 42:16.150
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:16.150 --> 42:17.963
We have so much more to talk about.

42:19.014 --> 42:21.750
- I think I have everything,
thank you so much.

42:21.750 --> 42:25.711
- You don't even know my
deepest darkest secret.

42:25.711 --> 42:28.910
(ominous music)

42:28.910 --> 42:31.360
- And what is that?

42:31.360 --> 42:32.373
- I should warn you.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.413
A storm is coming.

42:37.413 --> 42:38.830
(dial beeping)

42:38.830 --> 42:41.497
(steam hissing)

42:42.675 --> 42:45.425

42:54.373 --> 42:57.690

42:57.690 --> 43:00.440
(birds chirping)

43:17.049 --> 43:19.549
(eerie music)

43:36.367 --> 43:39.617
(dramatic piano music)

43:58.500 --> 43:59.933
- Where is this girl?

44:01.770 --> 44:02.920
- Who the hell are you?

44:05.119 --> 44:08.036
(foreboding music)

44:09.455 --> 44:13.540
This is a private compound,
do you have a search warrant?

44:13.540 --> 44:15.570
- One last time.

44:15.570 --> 44:17.646
Where is this girl?

44:17.646 --> 44:20.313
(ominous music)

44:24.063 --> 44:27.549
(gunshot popping)
(man groaning)

44:55.475 --> 44:58.392
(gunshots popping)

44:59.981 --> 45:02.731
(Havoc grunting)

45:11.860 --> 45:13.185
- Oh my God!

45:13.185 --> 45:14.018
Help!

45:15.703 --> 45:16.536
Oh my God!

45:17.730 --> 45:18.592
Fuck!

45:18.592 --> 45:19.425
Help me!

45:22.709 --> 45:23.542
Oh my God.

45:28.891 --> 45:31.808

(woman screaming)

46:22.153 --> 46:25.712
(foreboding music)

46:25.712 --> 46:27.067
Wait.

46:27.067 --> 46:28.825
No, don't touch her!

46:28.825 --> 46:31.492
(woman gasping)

46:42.563 --> 46:44.943
(woman crying)

46:44.943 --> 46:49.943
No, no, no, please.
(Ellen crying)

46:51.999 --> 46:53.168
No.

46:53.168 --> 46:54.851
(woman screaming)

46:54.851 --> 46:55.972
(blood squelching)

46:55.972 --> 46:56.805
No!

46:56.805 --> 46:58.130
No!

46:58.130 --> 46:59.796
(woman screaming)

46:59.796 --> 47:02.546
(drill creaking)

47:04.553 --> 47:07.220

47:21.565 --> 47:22.398
No.

47:39.584 --> 47:42.834
(dramatic piano music)

47:51.746 --> 47:54.040
(Ellen whimpering)

47:54.040 --> 47:55.207
Help me, help.

47:57.994 --> 47:59.294
Get away.

47:59.294 --> 48:01.044
You get away from me!

48:02.940 --> 48:03.773
Oh my God.

48:07.130 --> 48:09.447
(ominous music)

48:09.447 --> 48:12.114
(Ellen gagging)

48:21.635 --> 48:23.098

(Ellen coughing)

48:33.111 --> 48:34.629

51:15.776 --> 51:18.693

51:37.193 --> 51:42.193
(gunshots popping)
(man grunting)

52:09.093 --> 52:11.793
- Drop your weapon and put
your hands above your head.

52:15.768 --> 52:18.131
(Ellen crying)

52:18.131 --> 52:20.131
- Please just let me go.

52:21.233 --> 52:23.483
I won't tell anyone
about this place, please.

52:31.864 --> 52:33.326
Oh my God.

52:33.326 --> 52:34.993
Oh my God, you're a cop.

52:34.993 --> 52:36.743
Oh my God, thank God.

52:37.767 --> 52:40.170
I thought you were one of them.

52:41.100 --> 52:42.910
- Have you seen this girl?

52:42.910 --> 52:44.720
- Do you have any other police with you?

52:44.720 --> 52:45.980
Any other backup?

52:45.980 --> 52:47.597
- This girl, have you seen her?

52:51.463 --> 52:52.296
- What?

52:56.680 --> 52:59.760
- No, no, I haven't seen anyone like that.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.403
Officer, can you call in backup?

53:04.590 --> 53:06.210
Hello?

53:06.210 --> 53:08.390
Are you listening to what I am saying?

53:08.390 --> 53:12.593
There are multiple crimes
happening here, okay, murder!

53:15.850 --> 53:16.683
- Okay.

53:17.610 --> 53:18.710
Tell me what you know.

53:20.173 --> 53:22.200
- I was brought here to interview a man

53:22.200 --> 53:24.460
accused of murder, okay?

53:24.460 --> 53:26.213
He lures people in by telling them

53:26.213 --> 53:28.650
that they're gonna be on
a TV show, in reality,

53:28.650 --> 53:31.650
they're snuff films.

53:31.650 --> 53:34.083
He really kills the actors.

53:35.830 --> 53:36.663
- Actors?

53:39.400 --> 53:40.653
She's an actress.

53:47.550 --> 53:51.150
- This man has a killer here, okay?

53:51.150 --> 53:53.453
Something like you have never seen.

53:54.370 --> 53:56.360
They call him Havoc.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.760
- Keep talking until I understand.

53:58.760 --> 54:01.270
- I'll tell you everything
you need to know but not here.

54:01.270 --> 54:03.550
Okay, because if you have like a SWAT team

54:03.550 --> 54:06.203
or something with you,
they're gonna kill us both.

54:09.190 --> 54:11.350
- Can you drive a motorcycle?

54:11.350 --> 54:12.183
- No.

54:15.300 --> 54:16.133
- Come with me.

54:17.464 --> 54:20.464
(eerie tempo music)

54:36.258 --> 54:39.425
(exciting beat music)

54:49.026 --> 54:51.776
(motor rumbling)

55:29.184 --> 55:31.851
(motor revving)

55:39.957 --> 55:41.933
You know how to drive a car, right?

55:43.090 --> 55:43.923
- Yeah.

55:45.010 --> 55:45.843
Yeah, of course.

55:47.530 --> 55:50.100
- My cell phone doesn't
have reception up here.

55:50.100 --> 55:50.933
Take my car and--

55:50.933 --> 55:52.460
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're
not gonna come with me?

55:52.460 --> 55:53.930
- I can't.

55:53.930 --> 55:56.320
When you're in phone reception, call 911.

55:56.320 --> 55:59.283
- You want me to go by myself?

56:00.330 --> 56:02.820
- Tell them there's a detective on site.

56:02.820 --> 56:04.100
Give them my badge number.

56:04.100 --> 56:06.970
- Okay, but wait, why don't
you just come with me?

56:06.970 --> 56:07.843
- I can't leave.

56:09.410 --> 56:10.243
- Wait, wait.

56:11.150 --> 56:12.040
Wait.

56:12.040 --> 56:14.180
Because of the girl in the picture?

56:14.180 --> 56:15.360
- Yes.

56:15.360 --> 56:17.510
- I told you, I don't
even think I saw her.

56:19.160 --> 56:22.620
- Based on what I observed,
she's most likely here.

56:22.620 --> 56:25.010
- Okay, but you realize if she
is here she's being guarded

56:25.010 --> 56:27.530
by those men and their
machine guns, right?

56:27.530 --> 56:30.000
I mean, you're willing
to be killed for her?

56:30.000 --> 56:31.560
- Yes,

56:31.560 --> 56:33.610
and I'd kill the whole world to save her.

56:34.992 --> 56:36.442
- What kind of a cop are you?

56:37.367 --> 56:39.157
What is she, your kid or something?

56:39.157 --> 56:42.240
(gentle piano music)

56:53.018 --> 56:53.851
Shit.

56:56.851 --> 56:58.351
I should've known.

57:08.075 --> 57:10.742
(ominous music)

57:20.162 --> 57:21.401
Hey!

57:21.401 --> 57:22.633
Hey!

57:22.633 --> 57:24.490
Is that your car?

57:24.490 --> 57:25.637
- Yeah.

57:25.637 --> 57:26.470
- Okay.

57:30.140 --> 57:31.363
Okay, so when they
leave, we run over there

57:31.363 --> 57:33.343
then drive the hell outta here, right?

57:35.210 --> 57:36.043
- Only you.

57:36.998 --> 57:39.665
(ominous music)

57:50.783 --> 57:54.033
(dramatic tempo music)

58:28.412 --> 58:31.245
- Goddamn it, what are they doing?

58:32.880 --> 58:35.073
Waiting to see who comes back for the car?

58:36.100 --> 58:36.933
- Probably.

58:42.356 --> 58:45.439
(gentle piano music)

58:48.260 --> 58:49.103
- Hey, look.

58:50.040 --> 58:52.380
I'm sorry I gave you a hard time earlier.

58:52.380 --> 58:55.060
Okay, I understand she's your daughter.

58:55.060 --> 58:57.660
She's really lucky to have
a policeman for a father.

58:58.800 --> 59:00.103
- She never thought so.

59:01.873 --> 59:03.643
- When was the last time you saw her?

59:06.070 --> 59:07.643
- It's been over 10 years.

59:08.880 --> 59:09.713
- What?

59:11.830 --> 59:13.903
- I haven't even spoken to her.

59:15.383 --> 59:17.253
- How do you suspect she's even here?

59:18.920 --> 59:21.350
- My ex-wife reported her missing.

59:21.350 --> 59:22.703
I'm a detective.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.123
All clues point to here.

59:26.860 --> 59:28.920
- Well, I hope you find her.

59:28.920 --> 59:30.420
She'll be so happy to see you.

59:31.330 --> 59:35.353
- She hasn't been happy to
see me since she was eight.

59:39.230 --> 59:42.430
- Trust me, if she's in this nightmare,

59:42.430 --> 59:44.563
no matter what has happened in your past,

59:45.480 --> 59:46.830
she'll be happy to see you.

59:49.730 --> 59:51.917
- She's probably forgotten me by now.

59:54.937 --> 59:56.881
(gunshots popping)

59:56.881 --> 59:59.631
(metal clinking)

1:00:02.136 --> 1:00:03.548
(tire air hissing)

1:00:03.548 --> 1:00:06.271
- You don't happen to have
two spare tires, do you?

1:00:06.271 --> 1:00:08.771
(air hissing)

1:00:18.463 --> 1:00:21.046
(gun cranking)

1:00:24.035 --> 1:00:26.868

1:00:51.985 --> 1:00:54.568
(woman crying)

1:00:57.355 --> 1:00:58.188
- No!

1:01:03.467 --> 1:01:04.967
Somebody, help me!

1:01:06.340 --> 1:01:07.673
Please, stop it!

1:01:09.309 --> 1:01:12.388
(woman crying)

1:01:12.388 --> 1:01:13.221
Please!

1:01:20.005 --> 1:01:21.611
Stop touching me!

1:01:21.611 --> 1:01:23.056
Don't do this!

1:01:23.056 --> 1:01:24.889
I can't do it anymore!

1:01:27.522 --> 1:01:30.272
(dramatic music)

1:01:39.752 --> 1:01:42.335
(woman crying)

(Ellen gasping)

1:02:10.285 --> 1:02:13.035
(metal creaking)

1:02:36.277 --> 1:02:38.610
- Responding to shots fired.

1:02:53.500 --> 1:02:54.333
Go! Go!

1:03:02.436 --> 1:03:04.937
(gunshot booming)

1:03:04.937 --> 1:03:09.030
(rapid gunshot popping)

1:03:09.030 --> 1:03:11.613
(man groaning)

1:03:13.451 --> 1:03:15.951
(eerie music)

1:03:22.975 --> 1:03:25.642
(Ellen gasping)

1:03:34.533 --> 1:03:37.151
(Havoc grunting)

1:03:37.151 --> 1:03:39.901
