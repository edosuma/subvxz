00:43.747 --> 00:47.386
Gracious Mama, it's not like you to
meet a train.

00:47.387 --> 00:49.867
My dear, I'm taking you STRAIGHT to
the house.

00:50.336 --> 00:52.975
We'll go back and change and return
for dinner.

00:52.976 --> 00:55.775
Do you know what time she left
yesterday? Not precisely.

00:55.776 --> 00:57.976
The rest of us were at the
point-to-point.

00:57.977 --> 01:00.775
We heard when we got back. What are
we going to say now?

01:00.776 --> 01:05.015
I've been awake the whole night.
There's only one thing we can say.

01:05.016 --> 01:07.176
We have to tell Cora.

01:07.176 --> 01:09.256
Well, isn't that rather a betrayal?

01:09.257 --> 01:12.176
If anything happens to Edith and Cora
learns later

01:12.176 --> 01:14.536
we knew all along, she would never
forgive us.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.655
And I wouldn't blame her.

01:17.656 --> 01:20.056
You see, as a mother, it is her
right.

01:20.056 --> 01:22.136
But you don't plan to tell Robert?

01:22.137 --> 01:24.455
He is Edith's father.
He's a man.

01:24.456 --> 01:26.456
Men don't have rights.

01:28.896 --> 01:32.655
They telephoned Lady Rosamund last
night. She's on her way here now.

01:32.656 --> 01:35.215
It seems very hard they should have
guests staying

01:35.216 --> 01:37.456
and more coming for dinner with this
going on.

01:37.456 --> 01:39.936
They couldn't put them off without
telling them why.

01:39.937 --> 01:41.896
It'll make for a funny evening.

01:42.976 --> 01:46.295
We still don't know anything.
We know she's in London.

01:46.296 --> 01:49.935
She bought a ticket for King's
Cross. But where can she be hiding?

01:49.936 --> 01:53.695
It seems a terrific imposition for
us to be here. Should we just leave?

01:53.696 --> 01:58.096
Why? We've got Dicky Merton, the
Sinderbys and their son arriving.

01:58.096 --> 02:01.056
We could put them off. Please don't.
They're looking forward to it.

02:01.057 --> 02:02.855
You are. I don't think we should.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.255
We have to give the impression Edith
has gone away to stay somewhere.

02:06.256 --> 02:09.335
How terribly worrying this is for
you. I'm so sorry.

02:09.336 --> 02:12.535
Why the song and dance? Edith's gone
away. So what?

02:12.536 --> 02:15.295
We three should go for a walk and
leave them to talk.

02:15.296 --> 02:18.295
Tony can be our guide. He must know
the gardens pretty well.

02:18.296 --> 02:21.696
Maybe we should take some air.
I think we might emulate the others

02:21.696 --> 02:25.336
and let Cora show us the garden. I'm
not sure what good that'll do.

02:25.337 --> 02:28.736
When I say we need some air, we need
some air. Cora.

02:28.736 --> 02:32.216
If it's what you want. Mary, you can
manage the children when they get here.

02:32.217 --> 02:33.895
Of course.

02:33.896 --> 02:36.215
There's a person downstairs, M'Lady.

02:36.216 --> 02:40.135
A Mrs Drewe from Yew Tree Farm.
She's very anxious to see you.

02:40.136 --> 02:43.855
Oh. Well, you'd better show her in
my sitting room.

02:43.856 --> 02:47.455
I'm sorry, Mama. You go ahead
without me.

02:47.456 --> 02:49.655
I can take you for a walk if you
like.

02:49.656 --> 02:52.296
Why would I want to walk?

02:57.216 --> 03:02.015
I'm going in to change. I'll sneak
upstairs so I don't disturb them.

03:02.016 --> 03:05.376
See you at dinner. Not if I see you
first.

03:08.456 --> 03:12.335
I don't understand. You're so
well suited.

03:12.336 --> 03:15.735
And you're much more relaxed with
her than you are with Mary. Yes.

03:15.736 --> 03:19.175
You must admit it's odd - Mary is
trying to break off

03:19.176 --> 03:21.255
and Mabel is dying for love of you.

03:21.256 --> 03:24.815
I know. But I can't break it off
with Mary. Not now.

03:24.816 --> 03:26.895
Why not?

03:26.896 --> 03:31.175
Well, I won't explain it but suffice
to say, it wouldn't be honourable.

03:31.176 --> 03:34.815
You are an old dear if you think I
don't know what you're talking about.

03:34.816 --> 03:37.456
But isn't it up to Mary?
It's not what she wants.

03:38.936 --> 03:42.255
Not really. Did she look like a
woman today

03:42.256 --> 03:44.256
trying to rid herself of a suitor?

03:45.296 --> 03:48.735
You're muddling her instinct, which
is to hold every man in thrall,

03:48.736 --> 03:50.896
and her wish, which is to break up.

03:51.976 --> 03:54.096
I'm not convinced.
I wish you would be.

03:55.296 --> 03:57.296
For everyone's sake.

04:00.296 --> 04:03.455
Who was that letter from?
Mr Brook.

04:03.456 --> 04:06.735
He's got a new job in Salford so he
doesn't want to renew the lease.

04:06.736 --> 04:08.735
We need to find another tenant.
Damn it.

04:08.736 --> 04:11.375
Don't be ungrateful. I've blessed
your mother every day

04:11.376 --> 04:14.535
for leaving us the house. When you
have property, you have choices.

04:14.536 --> 04:19.975
What should we do? After he's gone,
let's ask for time off together.

04:19.976 --> 04:22.696
Go down. See what condition he has
left it in then we can plan.

04:24.336 --> 04:28.415
Why are you smiling?
Because whenever I see a problem,

04:28.416 --> 04:30.816
you see only possibilities.

04:31.976 --> 04:33.655
Did you both know?

04:33.656 --> 04:37.695
Mrs Drewe told me Rosamund knew you
went to see the child with Edith.

04:37.696 --> 04:41.215
Yes. And you never thought to tell
me I have a third grandchild.

04:41.216 --> 04:42.856
Edith didn't want me to.

04:42.856 --> 04:47.336
It makes sense of that bewildering
trip to Switzerland. What was I to do?

04:47.337 --> 04:50.495
She wouldn't get rid of it.
Get rid of it? It was her idea.

04:50.496 --> 04:53.015
But she wouldn't go through with it
in the end.

04:53.016 --> 04:57.016
And what did you know? Well, not
quite as much.

04:58.616 --> 05:00.976
I knew why they were in Switzerland.

05:00.976 --> 05:04.576
I thought she'd left the baby there.
That was the idea.

05:04.577 --> 05:08.335
Edith didn't stick to it. And you
never thought to involve me?

05:08.336 --> 05:13.135
Her OWN mother. You, Rosamund, you
looked at that little girl

05:13.136 --> 05:15.175
and you never thought it was my
business too?

05:15.176 --> 05:18.295
Well, we wanted to contain it.

05:18.296 --> 05:21.535
To make as little noise abroad as
possible.

05:21.536 --> 05:25.375
So what changed? What tipped her
over the edge and into running away?

05:25.376 --> 05:28.495
Well, I suppose we all knew Mr
Gregson was dead

05:28.496 --> 05:31.495
but the confirmation must have been
very upsetting.

05:31.496 --> 05:33.975
And Mrs Drewe was being difficult.

05:33.976 --> 05:36.896
Clearly the child couldn't stay
there indefinitely.

05:38.136 --> 05:40.215
So, we thought...

05:40.216 --> 05:43.135
What did you think? That it would be
better and safer

05:43.136 --> 05:45.535
if the girl was sent abroad. Now, we
have it.

05:45.536 --> 05:48.295
Edith was told her child would be
taken away.

05:48.296 --> 05:51.615
Are you going to say anything to
Robert?

05:51.616 --> 05:55.495
No. I agree with one thing -
the secret is not ours to tell.

05:55.496 --> 05:58.256
Somehow we must find Edith...

05:59.496 --> 06:01.896
..and we must hear from her what SHE
wants.

06:10.696 --> 06:12.495
M'Lady.

06:12.496 --> 06:15.415
I'm sorry to bother you. What is it,
Mrs Hughes?

06:15.416 --> 06:17.576
It may have slipped your mind,
M'Lady,

06:17.576 --> 06:20.016
but do you remember I gave you a
train ticket

06:20.017 --> 06:22.495
when we came to London for Lady
Rose's ball?

06:22.496 --> 06:25.175
It was a return ticket that I found
in the pocket

06:25.176 --> 06:28.055
of Mr Bates' overcoat.
Of course I remember.

06:28.056 --> 06:31.935
I don't suppose you put it anywhere
for safekeeping?

06:31.936 --> 06:35.575
Why? Because we were wrong.

06:35.576 --> 06:39.495
Far from proving Mr Bates went
to London on the day Mr Green died,

06:39.496 --> 06:42.775
it proved he didn't. He bought the
ticket in York

06:42.776 --> 06:46.495
but changed his mind and that's why
it was never given in.

06:46.496 --> 06:49.335
So it was proof of his innocence not
his guilt?

06:49.336 --> 06:51.175
That's about the size of it.

06:51.176 --> 06:55.456
I'm afraid I burnt it, Mrs Hughes.

06:58.496 --> 06:59.976
Atticus.

07:05.136 --> 07:09.855
Hello. Lord and Lady Sinderby.
Hello. Rose.

07:09.856 --> 07:13.375
Oh, you know my cousin. We were in
awe of your courage yesterday.

07:13.376 --> 07:17.296
Well, courage or foolhardiness. Come
and see Mama and Papa.

07:20.856 --> 07:23.855
To be honest, we're in the middle of
rather a drama.

07:23.856 --> 07:28.176
Which I'll tell you about but you
mustn't let on. Our first secret.

07:28.896 --> 07:32.535
This is cold so it can go up now but
cover it till it's served.

07:32.536 --> 07:35.895
Shall we work on Vanity Fair when
you've finished tonight? I dunno.

07:35.896 --> 07:38.495
Well, I'll ask you later.

07:38.496 --> 07:40.855
Lord Merton's arrived so everyone is
here.

07:40.856 --> 07:44.456
I'll announce it when you're ready.
I will be by the time you say it.

07:45.496 --> 07:47.575
You're very glum. Am I?

07:47.576 --> 07:50.735
Don't tell me your enthusiasm for
learning is drying up.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.935
Maybe. Have you read the papers
lately?

07:52.936 --> 07:55.215
I wish I had the time!

07:55.216 --> 07:58.375
Mr MacDonald seems to limp from
crisis to crisis.

07:58.376 --> 08:00.895
They were going to do so much when
they came in.

08:00.896 --> 08:04.655
The first Labour Government. Now, I
doubt they'll last the year.

08:04.656 --> 08:06.895
Don't take it personally. But I do.

08:06.896 --> 08:09.615
When I think about it, it seems to
me that we're trapped.

08:09.616 --> 08:13.575
Held fast in a system that gives us
no value and no freedom.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.975
Oi. Speak for yourself! I am. I do.

08:15.976 --> 08:19.255
And now I'm wondering. Is it worth
it me trying to better myself?

08:19.256 --> 08:20.815
What's the point?

08:20.816 --> 08:23.176
That's it. They're coming in.

08:35.655 --> 08:37.775
Miss Baxter.

08:37.775 --> 08:41.615
I'm afraid you think I've got you
both into trouble.

08:41.616 --> 08:44.655
I don't know what you mean. Yes, you
do.

08:44.656 --> 08:48.015
I said I had no proof. I gave them
nothing that would stand up.

08:48.016 --> 08:51.135
Why did you have to say anything?
I was in a difficult position.

08:51.136 --> 08:55.896
So now you've put us in one.
I'm very sorry. I am. Truly.

08:57.816 --> 09:00.296
I have to clean some shoes.

09:10.776 --> 09:15.336
Are you enjoying Yorkshire? Well,
first, we and Yorkshire

09:15.336 --> 09:18.255
have to get used to each other. But
you haven't come up against

09:18.256 --> 09:21.975
too many impassable barriers. Lord Grantham,
we both know what we're up against.

09:21.976 --> 09:24.856
Happily, we're used to it. You won't
have any trouble with us.

09:24.857 --> 09:28.815
Lady Grantham's father was Jewish.
That isn't a guarantee of tolerance.

09:28.816 --> 09:30.776
So it's a relief to hear you say it.

09:31.936 --> 09:34.736
Atticus seems to be very taken with
your niece.

09:35.456 --> 09:36.656
And I must say...

09:37.736 --> 09:39.896
..I find her quite
charming.

09:39.896 --> 09:45.095
Does Lord Sinderby approve? Well, you
know, he needs time

09:45.096 --> 09:47.015
to settle into things.

09:47.016 --> 09:49.455
Your mother never considered
converting.

09:49.456 --> 09:52.015
I don't believe so.

09:52.016 --> 09:56.455
Was it difficult? Having a different
religion from your father's?

09:56.456 --> 09:58.535
Not that I recall.

09:58.536 --> 10:00.575
Hm.

10:00.576 --> 10:04.095
And you're not ashamed of him? Lord
Sinderby, I would point out

10:04.096 --> 10:06.375
that we never changed our name.

10:06.376 --> 10:09.655
Hm. It was my grandfather's
decision.

10:09.656 --> 10:12.895
I thought of changing it back but
the family felt they were English

10:12.896 --> 10:14.575
now and they wanted to stay...

10:14.576 --> 10:15.935
English.

10:15.936 --> 10:18.655
Have you decided at last whether you
are leaving?

10:18.656 --> 10:20.255
'At last' is the right phrase

10:20.256 --> 10:23.015
but I want to make sure I do the
right thing.

10:23.016 --> 10:26.176
I don't want to disrupt Sybbie's
life and then regret it.

10:26.176 --> 10:28.136
You know they all want you to stay.

10:29.176 --> 10:31.176
That only makes it more difficult.

10:32.376 --> 10:36.216
Lord Grantham was saying Gregson
left Lady Edith his publishing company.

10:36.217 --> 10:38.935
Yes. Then shouldn't someone
telephone the office?

10:38.936 --> 10:42.575
Won't she go there? They must know
where to find her.

10:42.576 --> 10:46.095
Of course. How clever you are.

10:46.096 --> 10:48.976
Why? It seems rather obvious to me.

10:50.136 --> 10:54.815
Your mother and Robert are hitting
it off. She's not the problem. Oh?

10:54.816 --> 10:56.935
My father's the tough nut.

10:56.936 --> 11:00.975
My people are the other way round.
My father's a darling

11:00.976 --> 11:04.176
and my mother's the nut. Then we
shall crack them against each other.

11:06.416 --> 11:10.295
Strange how some people get married
and married and...

11:10.296 --> 11:12.375
we can't manage it once.

11:12.376 --> 11:15.616
Dogs barking in wrong trees spring to
mind.

11:17.216 --> 11:20.575
Tony, I'm sorry if you feel
I'm tracking you round the country,

11:20.576 --> 11:24.175
but I can't give up just yet.
We would be so happy if you'd let us.

11:24.176 --> 11:26.215
And I won't be if I don't?

11:26.216 --> 11:29.975
I remember my mother telling me, that
in the end,

11:29.976 --> 11:32.055
happiness is a matter of choice.

11:32.056 --> 11:35.775
Some people choose to be happy and
others select a course

11:35.776 --> 11:38.295
that leads only to frustration and
disappointment.

11:38.296 --> 11:41.335
And I'm one of the latter.
I terribly hope not.

11:41.336 --> 11:43.896
For my sake.

11:46.696 --> 11:48.855
I have a little announcement.

11:48.856 --> 11:51.056
Are you sure? I am.

11:53.216 --> 11:56.695
You might like to know that Lord
Merton and I have decided

11:56.696 --> 11:59.375
that we should get married.

11:59.376 --> 12:01.295
How lovely.

12:01.296 --> 12:04.175
Well, this calls for a toast.

12:04.176 --> 12:06.215
I give you, Mrs Crawley.

12:06.216 --> 12:08.976
Or should I say, the future Lady
Merton.

12:10.416 --> 12:14.215
The future Lady Merton!
The future Lady Merton.

12:14.216 --> 12:18.535
Naturally, it was the last thing I
ever thought would happen.

12:18.536 --> 12:21.135
I forced her into it.

12:21.136 --> 12:24.416
He wooed me into it and I'm terribly
pleased he did.

12:25.936 --> 12:28.256
Well...

12:29.656 --> 12:33.095
What's the matter, granny? I was
worried about Edith.

12:33.096 --> 12:35.616
I can't think why.

12:35.616 --> 12:39.695
My dear, a lack of compassion can be
as vulgar

12:39.696 --> 12:41.256
as an excess of tears.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.505
Ah, Daisy. Have you decided?

12:48.506 --> 12:51.266
Shall we discuss the vices of Miss
Becky Sharp?

12:51.266 --> 12:54.066
I'm tired. I'm going up. Good night,
Mrs Patmore.

12:55.186 --> 12:57.265
What's that about?

12:57.266 --> 13:01.266
She had such hopes of the Labour
Government, she feels let down.

13:01.266 --> 13:04.465
But she mustn't give up. I don't
recall you being this keen

13:04.466 --> 13:06.546
when Miss Bunting was teaching her.

13:06.547 --> 13:10.665
I wouldn't interfere with
a professional but now she's gone,

13:10.666 --> 13:12.425
I'd like to help if I can.

13:12.426 --> 13:15.385
Sounds to me as if you've missed out
on your vocation.

13:15.386 --> 13:17.745
Tell Daisy. Perhaps you can change
her mind.

13:17.746 --> 13:22.305
She wouldn't listen to me.
Well spotted. What about Mr Mason?

13:22.306 --> 13:25.305
Funnily enough, Mr Barrow might be
right for once.

13:25.306 --> 13:28.906
How do we get him to speak to her?
Let me think on it.

13:35.266 --> 13:38.665
I'm sorry if I seem distracted
but I'm truly so happy for you both.

13:38.666 --> 13:41.945
I thought I'd give a dinner so she
could meet my sons.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.545
Well, she has met Larry before.
Let's hope she's forgotten!

13:45.546 --> 13:48.705
Why don't we do it here? We could
invite Granny and everyone.

13:48.706 --> 13:52.945
You are my godfather and Isobel is
the grandmother of my child.

13:52.946 --> 13:55.505
Oh, please let's. It seems only
right, Mama.

13:55.506 --> 13:57.985
Of course. If you'd like. Oh, that
would be very kind.

13:57.986 --> 14:00.505
A signing of the bond between our
families.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.225
I wish we didn't know the anguish
lurking around.

14:03.226 --> 14:05.265
You love other people's secrets.

14:05.266 --> 14:07.585
Not these days.

14:07.586 --> 14:09.985
I can't tell you why I can't leave
Mary but...

14:09.986 --> 14:13.305
you'd understand if I did.
Just promise me it's a struggle.

14:13.306 --> 14:15.266
More than you know.

14:16.506 --> 14:19.865
We must go but it's been such fun.
I hope you come to us next time.

14:19.866 --> 14:24.345
We should love it. I suppose we just
have to wait and see what happens.

14:24.346 --> 14:27.786
No need to hurry them into anything.
They're both very young.

14:29.066 --> 14:32.065
Well, I would be delighted
if something were to come of it.

14:32.066 --> 14:34.746
Good night, Lady Grantham. Lady
Rosamund.

14:35.746 --> 14:38.025
The door, please, Molesley.

14:38.026 --> 14:40.625
They're so easy in each other's
company. Anyone can see.

14:40.626 --> 14:42.705
But he won't let me go.

14:42.706 --> 14:45.625
Because you refuse to make it clear
that you want him to.

14:45.626 --> 14:47.985
Just as he's moving off, you tug his
strings.

14:47.986 --> 14:50.665
Send a clear message and he'll go.
I promise.

14:50.666 --> 14:52.626
What is that message?

14:53.506 --> 14:55.466
We'll think of something.

14:57.226 --> 14:59.785
Atticus says the London office of
the magazine must know

14:59.786 --> 15:01.865
how to get in touch with Edith.

15:01.866 --> 15:05.505
I thought we weren't going to tell
anyone. He's not anyone, is he?

15:05.506 --> 15:10.025
Of course not. We could ring them
tomorrow but maybe I should go.

15:10.026 --> 15:12.065
Mr Aldridge is leaving.

15:12.066 --> 15:14.026
Oh.

15:16.066 --> 15:19.105
I'll train up in the morning.
I'm coming with you. I'm not going.

15:19.106 --> 15:22.705
I'll have a horrible day worrying.
Trust me.

15:22.706 --> 15:25.066
How can you imagine I'll ever trust
you again?

15:29.226 --> 15:31.145
She doesn't mean it. On the
contrary.

15:31.146 --> 15:34.386
It's the most honest thing she's
ever said to me.

15:37.106 --> 15:39.026
There you are.
Thank you.

15:47.826 --> 15:49.786
Is our life overcomplicated?

15:51.426 --> 15:55.425
In what way? Mrs Patmore is buying a
house up here.

15:55.426 --> 15:57.985
Why don't we sell the London house
and do the same?

15:57.986 --> 16:00.585
We could rent it out as long as we
want to work out Downton.

16:00.586 --> 16:04.225
And then live in it when we retire.
We had a dream once.

16:04.226 --> 16:07.025
Of a small hotel in the area.

16:07.026 --> 16:10.585
A London house, even a little one,
would buy something substantial here.

16:10.586 --> 16:12.546
I hate to say his name...

16:14.146 --> 16:17.466
..but do you feel the whole business
of Mr Green might be over?

16:18.186 --> 16:21.065
For us, I mean. Well, they seem to
have accepted the fact

16:21.066 --> 16:24.065
that I spent the day in York and
Miss Baxter has given them

16:24.066 --> 16:27.385
nothing new to go on. So we can dare
to plan our future again.

16:27.386 --> 16:30.425
Like normal people. Does that mean
what I hope it means?

16:30.426 --> 16:33.545
Mr Bates, I thought you'd decided to
believe me

16:33.546 --> 16:36.145
when I said that device was Lady
Mary's? I do believe you.

16:36.146 --> 16:39.665
I don't know why she wanted it but
I believe you. Well, then...

16:39.666 --> 16:42.865
You don't suppose there's anything
wrong with us, do you?

16:42.866 --> 16:44.945
No.

16:44.946 --> 16:47.625
I think it takes some people longer
than others.

16:47.626 --> 16:48.825
That's all.

16:48.826 --> 16:50.946
What would I do without you?

16:55.706 --> 16:59.146
Did they get away? Just about. The
train was late, thank heaven.

17:00.306 --> 17:03.665
And it isn't going to be Tony?
I don't think so.

17:03.666 --> 17:06.984
Nor Charles. He decided that before
I did. Well, well.

17:06.986 --> 17:12.145
I don't suppose your ancient
father's opinion carries much weight.

17:12.146 --> 17:15.705
'Fraid not. And I've just remembered
I said I'd go and see granny.

17:20.705 --> 17:24.505
So, I don't think Tony is going to
be my next son-in-law.

17:24.506 --> 17:27.226
I don't believe he is.

17:28.306 --> 17:31.265
Pity. I'd have been so pleased but
there we are.

17:31.266 --> 17:34.625
You're really not yourself, are you,
old girl?

17:34.626 --> 17:37.465
And what about you? We don't want
you to be on your own forever.

17:37.466 --> 17:40.665
Just to pick someone who shares the
family's values.

17:40.666 --> 17:44.305
Someone who feels friendly towards
us is not the same thing. No.

17:44.306 --> 17:49.465
You're right. And I don't blame you
for the departure of Miss Bunting.

17:49.466 --> 17:52.305
I didn't want to spend my life in a
bare knuckle fight.

17:52.306 --> 17:54.465
But something's changed. I feel it.

17:54.466 --> 17:56.426
I may as well tell you.

17:57.746 --> 17:59.825
I've written to my cousin in Boston.

17:59.826 --> 18:02.826
He's done well there and I'd like
his advice. I see.

18:05.066 --> 18:08.065
I apologise if my bad manners have
brought this on.

18:08.066 --> 18:12.025
No need to apologise. I am what I am
and you are what you are.

18:12.026 --> 18:14.305
Never the twain shall meet!
I wouldn't say that.

18:14.306 --> 18:16.345
I do love you all, you know.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.785
It'll be hard to go.

18:18.786 --> 18:20.626
On both sides.

18:22.346 --> 18:25.786
But we have no way of knowing
if Lady Edith will come in today.

18:25.787 --> 18:28.985
It's already tea-time and we close
the office at six.

18:28.986 --> 18:32.426
Then we'll wait until six. And we'll
come back in the morning.

18:32.426 --> 18:36.866
And every day till she either turns
up or contacts you with her whereabouts.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.905
It wouldn't be enough to give her
a message that you want to see her?

18:39.906 --> 18:42.146
No, it would not be enough.

18:47.306 --> 18:49.265
You've told her, haven't you?

18:49.266 --> 18:51.465
You've broken your word.

18:51.466 --> 18:54.825
No. I've... Mrs Drewe came to the
house.

18:54.826 --> 18:58.585
What did she want? She felt you had
used her badly.

18:58.586 --> 19:00.625
I confess it was a feeling we
shared.

19:00.626 --> 19:04.225
I'm not coming back, you know. Let's
not talk about it here.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.666
Come to me for dinner. No.

19:08.226 --> 19:11.265
Very well, we'll discuss it now in
front of your new employees

19:11.266 --> 19:13.226
and give them something to chew on.

19:14.346 --> 19:16.426
There is a tea room at the end of
the street.

19:23.906 --> 19:25.985
How are you, Spratt? Well, I hope.

19:25.986 --> 19:30.025
Everyone has their troubles, M'Lady.
Oh, dear.

19:30.026 --> 19:32.905
Spratt has been helping to train my
new maid. Denker.

19:32.906 --> 19:36.385
I'd say she takes
after the dachshund, M'Lady.

19:36.386 --> 19:39.585
In what way?
She's QUITE untrainable.

19:39.586 --> 19:43.386
Spratt. Will there be anything else,
Your Ladyship?

19:49.026 --> 19:51.025
Sounds like trouble to me.

19:51.026 --> 19:53.105
Are you certain Denker is worth it?

19:53.106 --> 19:55.945
Oh, you must put dinner on Friday
into your diary.

19:55.946 --> 19:58.505
That's when Dicky Merton is coming
with his sons.

19:58.506 --> 20:01.825
Yes. I wonder if it is a good idea.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.825
Isobel has got to meet them some
time.

20:04.826 --> 20:08.345
And Larry won't make trouble for Tom
again. Not with Sybil dead.

20:08.346 --> 20:10.306
Let us hope not.

20:12.066 --> 20:14.905
Granny, I know why you're finding
this difficult.

20:14.906 --> 20:19.265
Do you? Yes, but you mustn't give in
to it.

20:19.266 --> 20:22.465
What? Give in to what? Isobel has
always been your protege.

20:22.466 --> 20:26.305
She looks up to you and you have
kept her from harm in return.

20:26.306 --> 20:28.385
Have I?

20:28.386 --> 20:31.945
Yes. So of course it's difficult
that she is to take her place

20:31.946 --> 20:34.505
among the leaders of the county.
Why?

20:34.506 --> 20:37.385
Why is it difficult? You needn't
pretend.

20:37.386 --> 20:42.065
Your positions have changed - you
the widow in the Dower House,

20:42.066 --> 20:46.105
Isobel a great lady presiding over a
great house.

20:46.106 --> 20:48.746
But you simply have to be bigger
than that.

20:52.346 --> 20:54.425
Is that what you think of me?

20:54.426 --> 20:57.665
That I care about her change of
rank?

20:57.666 --> 21:00.585
Well, you're not exactly pleased,
are you?

21:00.586 --> 21:04.746
No. But that is not the reason.

21:05.386 --> 21:07.625
Then what is?

21:07.626 --> 21:09.586
If you must know...

21:11.106 --> 21:13.546
..I have got used to having a
companion.

21:15.666 --> 21:18.625
A friend. You know, someone to talk
things over with.

21:18.626 --> 21:21.905
Well, you'll still have us. You have
your own lives.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.866
And so you should.

21:25.666 --> 21:29.545
But Isobel and I had a lot in
common.

21:29.546 --> 21:31.506
And...

21:32.466 --> 21:34.425
..I shall miss her.
Granny,

21:34.426 --> 21:38.465
you're quite dewy-eyed.
I never think of you as sentimental.

21:38.466 --> 21:40.426
Nor am I.

21:41.106 --> 21:44.185
You've made me regret my confidence.
Do have some cake.

21:44.186 --> 21:46.425
And for your information...

21:46.426 --> 21:51.146
I don't think Isobel has EVER looked
up to me.

21:53.306 --> 21:56.505
Now, we drop the sticks in together
when I say.

21:56.506 --> 21:58.466
Ready? Go!

22:01.986 --> 22:04.585
Where are they?

22:04.586 --> 22:07.385
There it is. It's me! It's me!
Yes.

22:07.386 --> 22:09.346
Now make a wish.

22:11.986 --> 22:15.985
Darling, you know Aunt Edith has
gone to London? Yes.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.065
Well, I was thinking...

22:18.066 --> 22:22.265
I wonder what if we were to leave
here and go and live

22:22.266 --> 22:24.345
in a place far away across the sea?

22:24.346 --> 22:26.666
What would you say?
Why?

22:28.186 --> 22:30.146
Well, because...

22:31.226 --> 22:34.266
..it might be better for us to start
a new life there. Why?

22:36.346 --> 22:38.306
Because...

22:40.226 --> 22:42.865
Because I hope to God I'm doing the
right thing.

22:42.866 --> 22:45.425
That's the stable clock.

22:45.426 --> 22:47.386
WE had better get back.

23:02.026 --> 23:06.785
I've got an idea and I've told Mrs
Hughes but I want you to know it.

23:06.786 --> 23:10.345
I could swear the train ticket
hadn't been used. I would swear it.

23:10.346 --> 23:14.785
What? I saw the ticket in Mrs Hughes'
hand when she found it in the coat.

23:14.786 --> 23:17.745
It hadn't been torn in half. It was
whole. I saw it.

23:17.746 --> 23:19.785
Did you? Indeed.

23:19.786 --> 23:21.865
Things have moved on, Miss Baxter.

23:21.866 --> 23:24.265
They know Mr Bates was in York on
that day.

23:24.266 --> 23:26.105
I just wanted to be helpful.

23:26.106 --> 23:29.585
We know how you like to be helpful,
Miss Baxter.

23:29.586 --> 23:32.385
By talking to the police about us.

23:32.386 --> 23:35.905
Excuse me, I couldn't help
overhearing.

23:35.906 --> 23:40.505
Miss Baxter won't say it but she's
in a difficult position.

23:40.506 --> 23:44.465
On the contrary, Miss Baxter keeps
saying it.

23:44.466 --> 23:47.025
She says nothing else.

23:47.026 --> 23:50.466
Mr Molesley, can you remove
the baize from the tables, please?

23:54.466 --> 23:56.505
I'm ready to go up.

23:56.506 --> 23:58.466
I'll come with you.

24:03.146 --> 24:06.745
Ignore them. I can't. I feel sorry
for them.

24:06.746 --> 24:09.905
Then tell them why you had to talk
to the police.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.266
I'd feel ashamed.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.825
You're in luck. I'm only just back.

24:18.826 --> 24:23.226
Listen carefully. Today, I learned I've been
posted on a trade delegation to Poland.

24:23.227 --> 24:26.265
I'll be gone for months. Some people
have all the fun.

24:26.266 --> 24:28.585
I want you to come up to London
tomorrow.

24:28.586 --> 24:31.785
I've things I can't get out of
in the morning. That doesn't matter.

24:31.786 --> 24:35.065
I just need you from about seven
o'clock on. What for?

24:35.066 --> 24:38.305
Mabel's given me an idea of
how to settle it once and for all.

24:38.306 --> 24:41.545
Just be here. What sort of clothes?

24:41.546 --> 24:45.185
Rags. We're going to the Kinema. Ring
me when you get to London.

24:45.186 --> 24:47.386
Your wish is my command. Bye.

24:52.626 --> 24:55.465
I'm worried about Isis.
Why? What's the matter with her?

24:55.466 --> 24:59.105
She's not looking too clever. Did you
manage to get hold of Mr Stapeley?

24:59.106 --> 25:02.345
I spoke to his wife, My Lord. He's
away until Friday.

25:02.346 --> 25:04.425
Do you want me to try to find
someone else? No.

25:04.426 --> 25:07.945
I'll take her there myself on Friday
afternoon. Has the gong been rung?

25:07.946 --> 25:11.105
Just. Why do we bother to change?
It's you, me, Mary and Tom.

25:11.106 --> 25:13.665
Don't let Aunt Violet hear you.
Where have you been?

25:13.666 --> 25:16.185
I went to have tea with Atticus. We
met halfway in Ripon.

25:16.186 --> 25:19.665
It's getting quite serious then?
Fingers crossed.

25:19.666 --> 25:23.145
But darling, you don't want to rush
into anything. Oh, but I do.

25:23.146 --> 25:25.305
I want to rush in like billy-o.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.745
Rose, it's a big thing you're
contemplating.

25:27.746 --> 25:30.025
Bigger still because of the
circumstances.

25:30.026 --> 25:33.065
You sound like Lord Sinderby. I can
see he wasn't keen.

25:33.066 --> 25:36.225
He doesn't want Atticus to marry out
of the faith. He minds.

25:36.226 --> 25:39.345
Why shouldn't he mind? He's an
important figure in that community.

25:39.346 --> 25:42.025
But you're not against it, are you?
Of course not.

25:42.026 --> 25:45.706
Still, I think you ought to write to
your parents. Daddy won't stop me.

25:45.706 --> 25:49.346
I don't believe he will. And Mummy
hates everyone so what's the difference?

25:49.411 --> 25:54.146
Even so, it's best not to pretend
it'll be plain sailing.

25:59.177 --> 26:03.097
Where's Marigold? The hotel arranges
a baby-sitter when you need one.

26:03.098 --> 26:05.855
May I see her? I don't think so.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.655
Not tonight. So what are you going
to do?

26:08.656 --> 26:11.216
I was toying for a while with the
idea of going to America.

26:11.301 --> 26:14.781
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Why is it
ridiculous? She's half American.

26:14.782 --> 26:18.739
I thought I'd drop my title and
invent a dead husband.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.900
Then I'd be Mrs Thing in Detroit or
Chicago.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.559
Where I wouldn't run into anyone I
knew. So, is that your plan?

26:25.560 --> 26:29.399
I don't want the magazine business
to fall into ruin.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.440
How could I keep an eye on it
overseas?

26:32.600 --> 26:36.159
And I would like Marigold to grow up
English. What is the alternative?

26:36.160 --> 26:40.439
An invented dead husband here? I'd
never get away with it in London.

26:40.440 --> 26:43.239
I thought I'd make her my orphaned
godchild.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.200
Well, I have a different plan.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.359
I'd like you to bring her home.
No.

26:49.360 --> 26:52.719
I won't be the county failure. Poor
demented Lady Edith

26:52.720 --> 26:54.839
who lost her virtue and her reason.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.760
Just listen to my plan.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.959
The Drewes would reach a reluctant
conclusion

27:02.960 --> 27:06.440
that they can't afford to raise
their friend's child.

27:06.441 --> 27:10.199
You've grown so fond of the girl,
you ask if she might join

27:10.200 --> 27:13.839
the others in the Downton nursery.
The Drewe plan was mad enough.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.359
But this is COMPLETELY ludicrous.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.519
How could it possibly work?
Papa must never know the truth.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.680
I've thought about it and don't
agree.

27:21.680 --> 27:25.320
It would take time for him to get
used to the idea, he would make it.

27:25.321 --> 27:29.039
He'd never look at me in the same
way again. Very well.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.119
If that's how you feel, he doesn't
have to know. Nor Mary.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.040
I couldn't have her queening
it over me.

27:34.040 --> 27:38.240
No-one has to know who doesn't know
- your grandmother, Rosamund, you and me.

27:38.241 --> 27:40.679
Everyone else will be told the
story.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.199
And how would we execute this
insanity?

27:43.200 --> 27:46.399
A farmer's foster child turns up in
the Downton nursery?

27:46.400 --> 27:50.079
People adopt babies all the time
from all kinds of backgrounds.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.919
So you're going to do this?
I'll telephone Mr Drewe tonight

27:52.920 --> 27:55.999
when we get back to Belgrave Square
and I'll ask for his help.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.479
And what about his wife?
Let him manage her.

27:58.480 --> 28:02.439
Edith and I will go home tomorrow.
I'll ask Mr Drewe to meet the train

28:02.440 --> 28:07.679
and take Marigold, then
we'll discuss the Drewes' situation.

28:07.680 --> 28:13.279
At last, Edith will fetch the girl
and bring her back in broad daylight.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.920
Time to call it a day, ladies.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.800
I couldn't agree more.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.040
And one for you, Mr Moseley.

28:25.760 --> 28:29.439
I'm going out with Lady Mary this
afternoon but only for the night.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.599
You didn't have much warning. I know.
Something has come up.

28:32.600 --> 28:36.519
I suppose there's no point in you
looking in on the house. Not now.

28:36.520 --> 28:39.159
Leave it till Mr Brook's left and we
can both go.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.999
Ooh, it's an invitation from Mr
Mason. What? My Mr Mason?

28:43.000 --> 28:47.039
Your Mr Mason. He wants us to come
to the farm tomorrow for luncheon.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.000
If we can get the time off.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.279
Why don't you go with them? I'm sure
Her Ladyship wouldn't mind.

28:53.280 --> 28:58.239
What is it to you? You did me a good
turn when I'd done you a bad one.

28:58.240 --> 29:01.399
So I think you deserve a treat. He's
right. It'll do you good.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.479
But I've not been asked.

29:03.480 --> 29:08.039
Mr Mason would be glad to see you
but would Mr Carson let us go?

29:08.040 --> 29:10.759
Ooh, I think he will if you allow me
to handle it.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.319
He won't like it when we've got a
big dinner on.

29:13.320 --> 29:17.439
Just let me tell him. I'm the one
with the extra work.

29:17.440 --> 29:21.200
Would Miss Baxter be able to come
with us? As Mr Barrow says.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.520
Well, I don't see why not as long as
you're back in time. You can go early.

29:24.521 --> 29:27.759
I still don't understand why he'd
write to Mr Moseley.

29:27.760 --> 29:31.119
I might have mentioned he's been
helping you with your books.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.080
I write to him now and then.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.199
Can you see him? Not yet.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.600
Oh, my God. There's Mary.

29:50.600 --> 29:54.480
What? There's Mr Drewe. What shall
we do? Leave it to me.

29:55.600 --> 30:00.440
Mr Drewe. Can you help my mother
with her suitcases?

30:05.440 --> 30:09.319
My sister Mary is on the platform.
Go to the next station and come back.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.280
I'll cover the cost.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.640
Come on you. That's it. Come on,
darling. It's just a game.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.000
So, you found her. I did.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.360
I don't know what the fuss was
about. I wanted a day or two in London.

30:39.361 --> 30:42.280
I knew it. I said that's all it was.
What a nonsense they made.

30:42.280 --> 30:46.399
Why are you here? I'm catching the
first train to London. It's due any minute.

30:46.400 --> 30:49.400
When will you be back? I'm not sure.
Tomorrow, I think.

30:49.401 --> 30:51.480
Don't forget the dinner on Friday.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.880
We have a duty to protect Isobel
from Larry Grey.

30:53.881 --> 30:55.879
I don't think he'll try anything,
do you?

30:55.880 --> 30:58.400
Well, have a lovely time. I'm sure I
will.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.960
That was close.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.319
Have I met your younger son? I
remember the elder one.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.679
I should think you do.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.320
After his outburst the last time.

31:17.320 --> 31:20.720
But Larry was fond of Sybil and not
about to welcome the man who'd won her.

31:20.721 --> 31:24.679
Let us hope the years since have made
him more forgiving.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.559
I'm looking forward to it and think
we should make no reference

31:27.560 --> 31:29.839
to the earlier meeting. How lucky I
am in you.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.480
I know it every time you speak.
Flatterer.

31:33.480 --> 31:37.679
I should be going. I'll see you on
Friday. I can't wait.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.120
Thank you so much for my lovely tea.
Not a bit.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.800
Spratt will see you out.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.919
Spratt still looks rather down in
the mouth.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.680
I'm afraid the battles with Denker
are far from resolved.

31:58.160 --> 32:01.239
It's good to have a moment alone to
say how much I appreciate

32:01.240 --> 32:04.279
your kindness to Dicky. I know you
don't approve.

32:04.280 --> 32:07.999
Which makes you all the more
generous. It's too late to stop it.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.199
How is Prince Kuragin?

32:10.200 --> 32:13.839
I haven't heard from him lately. Why?

32:13.840 --> 32:17.319
I was wondering how you were going
to manage when the Princess arrives.

32:17.320 --> 32:20.799
Will you receive her here? Well, I'm
not sure.

32:20.800 --> 32:25.199
Since Shrimpie hasn't found her yet,
I've got time to plan.

32:25.200 --> 32:28.039
- Ah.
- Oh!

32:28.040 --> 32:31.319
What is it now, Spratt?

32:31.320 --> 32:35.399
I'm sorry to bother Your Ladyship.
Especially when you have company.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.119
I'm afraid I must...
hand in my notice.

32:38.120 --> 32:42.679
I have suffered as much as anyone
can expect to suffer

32:42.680 --> 32:44.719
in the course of their duties.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.759
I can take no more, M'Lady.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.440
I can take no more.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.559
Typical Spratt.

32:55.560 --> 32:58.519
He's as touchy as a beauty losing her
looks.

32:58.520 --> 33:04.199
You don't think he meant it? If he
did, he'd have given it quietly.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.959
For a good reference in return. No.
No.

33:06.960 --> 33:12.479
It's a demonstration of discontent.
So you'll forgive his outburst?

33:12.480 --> 33:16.480
Anything rather than find a new
butler.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.559
Why did we have to rush out? Come
and stand here.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.679
I still don't understand. You will.

33:36.680 --> 33:40.039
Do exactly as I tell you and you
will. Kiss me.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.440
What? Kiss me. Now!

33:47.320 --> 33:49.759
Mary.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.759
What are you doing here? So what did
you think of the film?

33:52.760 --> 33:55.159
There was no need to stage a
tableau.

33:55.160 --> 33:58.279
If you'd just told me I was allowed
to walk away, I'd have gone.

33:58.280 --> 34:01.639
Without any silly games. But I DID
tell you. Often.

34:01.640 --> 34:05.279
And you didn't go. Well, I'm going
now.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.799
I know. And I wish you both such
happiness, Tony.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.319
I do. I don't want to hurry anyone
but can we bring this to an end?

34:12.320 --> 34:16.159
I've had quite enough sentiment from
John Barrymore and I'm starving.

34:16.159 --> 34:19.000
Goodbye, Mary. And good luck to you.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.039
I'm glad to have engineered a
resolution

34:24.040 --> 34:27.199
even if I should have thought of it
long ago. He said we didn't need to.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.839
But I know we did. It's funny. I
feel quite sad in a way.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.639
But not sad enough to change my
mind.

34:33.639 --> 34:38.120
She's nice, you know. She'll suit him
very well. Good. I'm glad.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.918
So, what now? Shall
we find ourselves some dinner too?

34:42.920 --> 34:44.998
Let's. We'll toast the fun we've had.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
And whatever the future may bring
us.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.879
When are you off to Poland? I catch
the boat train on Monday.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.719
So I'm scrambling around trying to
get everything done.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.559
When are you back? Oh, not for
months or even a year.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.560
You'll be married by then.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.200
There. Are we all finished?

35:05.240 --> 35:08.519
How lovely, Daisy, to have such a
beautiful place to come to.

35:08.520 --> 35:13.439
She's always welcome is Daisy. I've
not been here enough lately.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.119
You've been busy I know. With your
books.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.999
That takes up time. I think I'll
stop it now.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.599
So I'll be able to visit more.

35:20.600 --> 35:24.999
Do you think she's right to give up
her studies, Mr Mason? I do NOT.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.079
Don't you want to see more of me?
You know I do.

35:28.080 --> 35:31.559
But education is power. Don't forget
that.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.239
There's no limit to what you can
achieve

35:34.240 --> 35:38.839
if you'll just give a year or two to
mastering those books. I agree.

35:38.840 --> 35:43.359
There are millions out there who
could have done so much

35:43.360 --> 35:46.199
if they'd only been given an
education.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.159
I'm one of 'em. I could have made
something worthwhile of my life

35:49.160 --> 35:53.279
if I'd had the chance. Don't talk as
if your life were not worthwhile...

35:53.280 --> 35:57.359
when I know it is. I think
the system is slanted against us.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.159
The men in charge will always be the
men in charge.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.639
How can you say that with a Labour
Government in power?

36:02.640 --> 36:06.399
I doubt they'll last the year. Next
time, when they're elected,

36:06.400 --> 36:08.479
it'll be for longer, and soon

36:08.480 --> 36:11.000
a Labour Government might seem
ordinary.

36:12.160 --> 36:15.119
Do you think I should stick at it?
I do!

36:15.120 --> 36:18.239
And now, we ought to think
about getting you back to the bus.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.159
Let me take these. No. No.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.199
Daisy and I are your hosts.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.200
Thank you. Well, thank you.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.919
He's made a daughter out
of his widowed daughter-in-law.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.920
I like it when good things come from
bad.

36:40.320 --> 36:43.679
Have you thought of explaining to
Mr Bates why you had to speak out?

36:43.680 --> 36:45.759
He'd understand if anyone would.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.800
He's troubles enough
without burdening him with mine.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.599
We should go. We must be back in
good time for Mrs Crawley's dinner.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.999
Mr Carson says there was trouble
the last time

36:55.000 --> 36:58.359
Lord Merton's elder son came to
Downton. What happened?

36:58.360 --> 37:02.479
Alfred told me if Mr Branson hadn't
been too drunk to stand

37:02.480 --> 37:04.560
we'd have had fisticuffs on the
table.

37:05.680 --> 37:09.080
And here's my thinking life
in a great house must be dull work.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.360
Walk on.

37:15.449 --> 37:17.769
Do Mr and Mrs Drewe really want you
to take her?

37:17.900 --> 37:20.739
Or is it just a way of keeping her
here till they have her back?

37:20.740 --> 37:24.099
I don't think so. They simply can't
afford another child.

37:24.100 --> 37:27.420
And there aren't any prior claims?
Apparently not.

37:27.421 --> 37:30.099
That's why they took her in the
first place.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.700
What did he say? Is she carrying
puppies?

37:33.700 --> 37:36.580
I don't see how that could have
happened. It's not that.

37:36.581 --> 37:39.299
She's got cancer. Poor old thing.

37:39.300 --> 37:43.179
Oh, no. Oh, how I hate that word.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.259
He said it won't take long now.

37:45.260 --> 37:49.979
He offered to put her down there and
then but I couldn't let him.

37:49.980 --> 37:52.980
Oh, Papa. I'm so, so sorry.

37:52.980 --> 37:55.100
Of course, it was stupid to mind so
much.

37:55.101 --> 37:57.819
She doesn't even know who I am beyond
the hand that feeds her

37:57.820 --> 37:59.779
but even so...

37:59.780 --> 38:02.699
We'll keep her right here. This is
her spot.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.819
She'll know she's back at home.

38:04.820 --> 38:09.659
I suppose we can't stop this ghastly
dinner tonight.

38:09.660 --> 38:12.619
I don't see how. Dicky's sons have
come from London.

38:12.620 --> 38:16.379
And Atticus was on the same train.
No, of course we can't put it off.

38:16.380 --> 38:19.059
I wasn't thinking. Why don't we say
that you're ill?

38:19.060 --> 38:22.539
I could watch her. I don't have to
go to the dinner. I think you do.

38:22.540 --> 38:25.340
To lay the ghost of the last time
Larry Grey was here.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.459
I asked them to bring them down
early.

38:30.460 --> 38:32.899
Hello, Daddy. Come to Mama, darling.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.580
Hello, my darling.

38:36.580 --> 38:39.859
So, how should I answer?

38:39.860 --> 38:43.699
What's this about? The child at the
Drewe's house.

38:43.700 --> 38:46.739
Oh. It seems idiotic to me.

38:46.740 --> 38:50.459
And me. What about if you want to
start a family of your own?

38:50.460 --> 38:54.379
But I dote on her. If they send her
to some horrid orphanage,

38:54.380 --> 38:57.699
I'd never forgive myself. Can't you
just give them some money?

38:57.700 --> 38:59.820
So they can keep her.
I think...

39:00.900 --> 39:05.539
..Mrs Drewe finds it too much. It
isn't only the money.

39:05.540 --> 39:08.860
It seems a bit feeble. Does it?
Looking at these two.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.139
So, should I take her?

39:13.140 --> 39:15.300
Papa?

39:19.220 --> 39:22.139
I'll leave it to your mother.
Well...

39:22.140 --> 39:24.659
I believe we should offer little
Marigold a home here.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.620
Do you really, darling?

39:30.460 --> 39:32.780
Well, then, I suppose that's
settled.

39:38.740 --> 39:42.299
Have all the guests arrived?

39:42.300 --> 39:46.539
I think so. I should tell
Mrs Patmore it won't be long now.

39:46.540 --> 39:48.499
What are these?

39:48.500 --> 39:51.979
Mr Carson's got a notion he and I
might buy a place

39:51.980 --> 39:56.619
as an investment and maybe run it as
a guesthouse or rent it out.

39:56.620 --> 39:58.699
How strange.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.219
Mr Bates was talking about doing
something similar.

40:01.220 --> 40:04.539
I suppose we're all beginning
to think of a different future

40:04.540 --> 40:06.860
whether we want to or not.

40:08.060 --> 40:11.539
The other day, Mr Drewe was on the
platform.

40:11.540 --> 40:14.539
When Lady Mary and I were waiting
for the London train.

40:14.540 --> 40:19.299
Oh, yes. Then her Ladyship and Lady
Edith arrived.

40:19.300 --> 40:22.859
And he got into their carriage. He
helped lift their bags out.

40:22.860 --> 40:25.300
But then he just stayed there.
In first class?

40:26.900 --> 40:29.420
That'll have cost him a pretty
penny.

40:29.420 --> 40:33.420
When the train moved off, I thought
for a moment he had a child on his lap.

40:33.421 --> 40:38.219
I may have been wrong. Anna, you
shouldn't involve yourself

40:38.220 --> 40:40.019
in any speculation of that sort.

40:40.020 --> 40:44.379
The child is safe and the child is
loved.

40:44.380 --> 40:46.420
And that's all we need to be sure
of.

40:51.820 --> 40:55.379
I've been hearing about Edith's
plan. How marvellous of her.

40:55.380 --> 40:57.699
If you ask me, it's absolutely
crackers.

40:57.700 --> 41:00.860
Cora seems pleased. What idea is
this?

41:00.860 --> 41:05.060
Edith has taken in a motherless
child and is giving her a home here.

41:05.061 --> 41:08.419
I should have thought an orphan an
uncomfortable piece of baggage

41:08.420 --> 41:09.899
for an unmarried woman.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.300
You mean a man might not want
to take the child on?

41:13.700 --> 41:15.300
Well, I wouldn't.

41:16.780 --> 41:20.940
Rose, have you written to your mother
about Mr Aldridge? I have now.

41:20.940 --> 41:25.779
And will she approve? Don't be
disappointing, Aunt Violet, please.

41:25.780 --> 41:29.419
I promise you we know difference in
religion is a big thing.

41:29.420 --> 41:33.899
Quite right. How would you bring up
any children, for example? Children?

41:33.900 --> 41:37.659
When did this happen? Talking
hypothetically.

41:37.660 --> 41:40.419
The fact is, most marriages that
fail,

41:40.420 --> 41:42.859
founder for precisely this kind of
reason.

41:42.860 --> 41:47.499
An irreconcilable difference.
Or maybe they just don't get on.

41:47.500 --> 41:50.179
No, I'd agree with Larry.
It's usually more than that.

41:50.180 --> 41:53.779
It might be different beliefs, or
different nationalities

41:53.780 --> 41:55.859
or a huge age gap.

41:55.860 --> 41:58.659
It the end, they cannot see
eye-to-eye.

41:58.660 --> 42:02.379
I don't see what you're getting at.
You mean to marry Mrs Crawley.

42:02.380 --> 42:06.259
She seems very nice and I wish you
both every happiness.

42:06.260 --> 42:07.739
Thank you.

42:07.740 --> 42:12.579
But that doesn't prevent me from
seeing the wide disparity in class

42:12.580 --> 42:15.019
and background may prove your
undoing.

42:15.020 --> 42:18.699
What did you say? Only that Mrs
Crawley, a decent middle class woman

42:18.700 --> 42:22.180
with neither birth nor fortune
is expecting to fill another's shoes

42:22.180 --> 42:24.340
as one of the leaders of the county.

42:25.380 --> 42:27.459
Is she capable of it?

42:27.460 --> 42:31.139
Or will her inevitable failure prove
a source of misery to them both?

42:31.140 --> 42:34.579
Do you know Mrs Crawley's late son
was my heir?

42:34.580 --> 42:38.059
What does that prove? Everyone has
distant cousins who are odd.

42:38.060 --> 42:40.780
How dare you?! Will you GO, Larry?

42:42.340 --> 42:44.980
I had to make excuses for your
rudeness the last time

42:44.980 --> 42:48.620
you sat at this table. It is tiring
to think I should be called upon

42:48.621 --> 42:51.580
to do so AGAIN. I know the choice of
in-laws is eccentric.

42:51.580 --> 42:55.300
In this family, you already boast a
chauffeur and soon you can claim a Jew -

42:55.301 --> 42:57.380
Why don't you just get out, you
bastard?!

42:57.380 --> 42:59.940
And suddenly we've slipped into a
foreign tongue.

43:03.220 --> 43:07.019
Well, if that is how you feel?

43:07.020 --> 43:10.740
I do not endorse Tom's language but
that is certainly how we all feel.

43:13.180 --> 43:16.220
Then, Lady Grantham, goodbye.

43:18.100 --> 43:20.220
And thank you for a delightful
evening.

43:31.020 --> 43:32.980
What did you imagine?

43:34.500 --> 43:36.860
That we would welcome you with open
arms?

43:41.020 --> 43:44.459
He actually called him that? He did.
Right to his face.

43:44.460 --> 43:48.220
Mr Moseley, please.
I think he was right to say it.

43:48.220 --> 43:51.780
He may have been right but I will not
have bad language in front of the maids.

43:51.781 --> 43:54.860
I feel sorry for Mrs Crawley. Why
should she be humiliated?

43:54.860 --> 43:58.019
They're leaving early.
No wonder.

43:58.020 --> 44:01.899
Mr Moseley, why are you
down here? Not gossiping I hope?

44:01.900 --> 44:04.660
Oh, no, no, Mr Carson, no.

44:06.420 --> 44:08.499
Golly, what an evening.

44:08.500 --> 44:12.419
We won't forget it in a hurry. Let
us remember it for two reasons.

44:12.420 --> 44:15.899
One bad, one good. What's the good
one? I hope it is good.

44:15.900 --> 44:19.619
I'm listening. See, the thing is, it
occurs to me

44:19.620 --> 44:22.499
that we're already having to defend
ourselves. Yes.

44:22.500 --> 44:27.339
Let's have a real reason to.
That is, if you feel equal to it.

44:27.340 --> 44:30.259
I'm not going to give you an answer
until you say it properly.

44:30.260 --> 44:33.099
Do I have to kneel down?
Of course.

44:33.100 --> 44:35.419
But you don't have to stay kneeling
for very long.

44:35.420 --> 44:38.940
Rose, darling Rose...

44:39.700 --> 44:42.419
..will you marry me?

44:42.420 --> 44:44.499
Oh, you can get up now. Come on.

44:44.500 --> 44:48.979
We ought to be serious. The truth is
we haven't known each other long.

44:48.980 --> 44:53.459
And they're right. There are bound
to be problems. The way I see it,

44:53.460 --> 44:56.099
we both know we're going to get
married in the end.

44:56.100 --> 44:58.139
We know we're right together.
Yes!

44:58.140 --> 45:01.819
I suppose we do.
That's all I need to hear.

45:01.820 --> 45:03.419
I'll telephone tomorrow

45:03.420 --> 45:06.740
and we'll settle who tells what
to whom and when. Oh, darling.

45:18.460 --> 45:22.179
I'm going to wait in the car. Take
as long as you like.

45:22.180 --> 45:25.220
We'll laugh about this one day.
The sooner, the better.

45:26.820 --> 45:28.780
Night. Good night.

45:29.860 --> 45:33.539
Tell me it won't change your mind.
I can't talk about this tonight,

45:33.540 --> 45:35.699
nor for some time to come.

45:35.700 --> 45:38.019
And I think Rose and her young man
will take up

45:38.020 --> 45:40.739
every scrap of attention we have for
weddings.

45:40.740 --> 45:43.219
Please don't say that.
Papa!

45:43.220 --> 45:45.739
Larry's been in the car since he
left the dining room.

45:45.740 --> 45:49.379
I'm just coming. I'll say good
night, Mrs Crawley.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.380
Good night.

45:54.900 --> 45:58.019
Don't blame Larry. He was close to
his mother

45:58.020 --> 46:00.779
and hates the thought
of a replacement. They both do.

46:00.780 --> 46:02.859
You don't need to remind me.

46:02.860 --> 46:06.020
The boys take after their mother in
every possible way.

46:19.460 --> 46:22.059
I'm going to sleep in the dressing
room tonight.

46:22.060 --> 46:24.660
I'm not cross. I just want to have
her with me.

46:24.660 --> 46:26.739
Stay here.

46:26.740 --> 46:30.739
The thing is, I'm pretty sure she
won't last till morning

46:30.740 --> 46:32.740
and I don't want her to be
frightened.

46:34.060 --> 46:36.139
Then lay her here between us.

46:36.140 --> 46:39.500
And she'll know she has someone who
loves her very much next to her.

46:43.460 --> 46:47.420
Two people who love her and each
other very much on either side.

46:49.620 --> 46:52.180
I only hope I can say the same when
my time comes.

47:00.700 --> 47:04.019
Love may not conquer all but it can
conquer quite a lot.

47:04.020 --> 47:08.139
Mummy, Daddy, can you try to behave like
a happy couple? Wouldn't that be dishonest?

47:08.140 --> 47:11.459
I could get a job in London, I know
I could. I'm sure you could.

47:11.460 --> 47:13.760
We have our memories, you and I.

47:13.769 --> 47:16.328
I feel as if our household is
breaking up, Carson.

47:16.329 --> 47:20.009
He's trying to bully it out but it's
best not to stand in his way.
