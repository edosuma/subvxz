I'm fine. I'm just trying

08:06.752 --> 08:08.417
to see under this door.

08:08.459 --> 08:09.938
I was up all night

08:09.939 --> 08:11.417
wondering what's behind it.

08:11.459 --> 08:13.334
- I only got 12
- hours of sleep.

08:14.751 --> 08:15.876
The struggle is real.

08:16.918 --> 08:18.480
Meanwhile, leave

08:18.481 --> 08:20.042
that door alone.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.480
Morgan and Christina

08:21.481 --> 08:22.876
told me two things when

08:20.083 --> 08:22.876
I came to work here.

08:22.918 --> 08:24.709
One, Zuri's a biter.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.000
And two,

08:27.042 --> 08:30.375
never, ever go in that room.

08:30.417 --> 08:31.730
You're not at all curious

08:31.731 --> 08:33.042
about what's behind this door?

08:33.082 --> 08:35.042
No way.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.230
And if you'd walked in on

08:36.231 --> 08:37.375
as many weird things

08:35.082 --> 08:37.375
as I have in this penthouse,

08:37.417 --> 08:38.542
you wouldn't be either.

08:38.583 --> 08:39.792
Three words.

08:39.793 --> 08:41.000
Lacy lizard lingerie.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.876
Dude, why didn't you

08:47.877 --> 08:49.667
tell me they have a whole

08:46.083 --> 08:49.667
room at school

08:49.709 --> 08:51.001
full of books

08:51.002 --> 08:52.292
you can borrow for free?

08:52.334 --> 08:53.834
Perhaps because

08:53.835 --> 08:55.334
the only time you ever

08:52.334 --> 08:55.334
picked up a book,

08:55.375 --> 08:57.000
it was to kill a spider.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.042
- Actually, it
- only had six legs.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.542
So obviously,

09:02.543 --> 09:04.000
it was an arilus cristatus.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.292
I hate you.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.334
Hey, Jessie, I finished

09:09.335 --> 09:10.584
my book report.

09:10.626 --> 09:12.834
You know, up until today

09:12.835 --> 09:15.042
I thought Wuthering Heights

09:10.626 --> 09:15.042
was where Jay Z grew up.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.876
You also thought Beowulf

09:16.877 --> 09:18.667
was fan fiction about

09:15.083 --> 09:18.667
Beyonce and Wolverine.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.042
Mmm.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.042
- You know, ever since
- I found out I was smart,

09:22.083 --> 09:23.688
I've been kicking butt

09:23.689 --> 09:25.292
in my classes.

09:25.334 --> 09:27.188
Looks like I just stole

09:27.189 --> 09:29.042
your seat at the

09:25.334 --> 09:29.042
Periodic Table, son!

09:29.083 --> 09:30.292
(CHUCKLES)

09:32.500 --> 09:33.959
Mocked by a man who once

09:33.960 --> 09:35.417
lost a game of tic tac toe

09:35.459 --> 09:36.459
to a chicken!

09:38.083 --> 09:39.709
Ravi, I'm worried about you.

09:39.751 --> 09:40.959
You're not yourself.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.376
Of course I am not myself!

09:42.377 --> 09:43.751
Luke is myself!

09:43.792 --> 09:45.417
And I am beside myself.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.876
- Which means I am
- beside Luke.

09:46.918 --> 09:48.393
- Which is better than
- being behind him,

09:48.417 --> 09:50.058
- But still not great.
- Storming off now!

09:52.375 --> 09:54.042
Jessie, you have to help me.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.059
- People at school - are calling me
- Zuri's Sister.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.667
You are Zuri's sister.

09:58.709 --> 10:00.042
I feel like Zuri

10:00.043 --> 10:01.375
is stealing my identity.

10:01.417 --> 10:02.751
Okay. Emma,

10:02.792 --> 10:04.105
I know not being named

10:04.106 --> 10:05.417
New York It Girl was a blow,

10:05.459 --> 10:06.709
but Zuri is not

10:06.710 --> 10:07.959
stealing your identity.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.042
Absolutely, Donatella,

10:10.083 --> 10:12.059
- just send your spring line
- over to the penthouse.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.355
I'm sure it'll be

10:13.356 --> 10:14.626
totes adorbs.

10:16.792 --> 10:18.459
- Yeah, you should
- totes be worried.

10:21.876 --> 10:25.042
Darn, I can't see anything!

10:25.083 --> 10:26.792
Luke says this snake

10:26.793 --> 10:28.500

10:25.083 --> 10:28.500
under Jessie's door.

10:29.834 --> 10:31.334
(MRS. KIPLING SCREECHING)

10:32.667 --> 10:34.542

10:34.584 --> 10:36.042
Mrs. Kipling?

10:36.083 --> 10:37.334
Please tell me you're having

10:37.335 --> 10:38.584
a playdate in there.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Ahhh!

10:45.083 --> 10:46.500
Pork rind me.

10:48.459 --> 10:51.459
Ravi! Ravi's friend!

10:51.500 --> 10:53.560
- There are creatures behind
- the secret door in there!

10:53.584 --> 10:55.542
- I think I just made
- one of them angry.

10:56.918 --> 10:58.042
Oh, Emma.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.709
- I'm sorry, I didn't
- recognize you.

10:59.751 --> 11:01.000
Also, yeesh!

11:03.500 --> 11:04.584
Why do you not just

11:04.585 --> 11:05.667
ask Luke to help you?

11:05.709 --> 11:06.793
He seems to have

11:06.794 --> 11:07.876
all the answers.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.293
Yeah, and if that doesn't

11:09.294 --> 11:10.667
work, ask Zuri.

11:10.709 --> 11:12.375
- Everyone totes
- adores her.

11:14.125 --> 11:16.084
Actually, I think it's

11:16.085 --> 11:18.042
even scarier in here.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.063
You know, it is one thing

11:20.064 --> 11:22.042
for Luke to have discovered

11:18.083 --> 11:22.042
his ability to think.

11:22.083 --> 11:24.042
- But to steal
- my manner of dress,

11:24.083 --> 11:25.167
My witty repartee,

11:25.209 --> 11:27.167
and lord his smarts over me?

11:27.209 --> 11:29.042
Too far, sir, too far!

11:29.959 --> 11:31.000
Yeah!

11:31.042 --> 11:32.185
And now Zuri is going to make

11:32.209 --> 11:33.605
every girl in New York

11:33.606 --> 11:35.000
sick with jealousy.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.876
- I wanted to make those
- girls sick!

11:38.542 --> 11:41.042
My life is over!

11:41.083 --> 11:43.584
No, it is not!

11:43.626 --> 11:44.709
You have the chance

11:44.710 --> 11:45.792
to be on top again!

11:46.542 --> 11:47.542
Really?

11:48.209 --> 11:49.397
You think so?

11:49.398 --> 11:50.584
Of course!

11:50.626 --> 11:52.313
You simply cannot see

11:52.314 --> 11:54.000
the trees through the forest

11:50.626 --> 11:54.000
on your forehead.

11:55.125 --> 11:56.792
You are right.

11:56.834 --> 11:57.959
I'm going to take back

11:57.960 --> 11:59.083
my identity.

11:59.125 --> 12:01.000
To my make-up mirror!

12:01.042 --> 12:02.271
You might want to give it

12:02.272 --> 12:03.500
a little warning.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.125
It is in for a shock.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.876
- Luke, are you
- hoarding food?

12:09.918 --> 12:11.189
Oh, don't tell me

12:11.190 --> 12:12.459
you're taking Bertram's

12:09.918 --> 12:12.459
identity too.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.167
- No, it's for
- a science project.

12:15.209 --> 12:17.500
I gotta keep my straight A's.

12:17.542 --> 12:18.793
I'm trying to decide

12:18.794 --> 12:20.042
between Harvard or

12:17.542 --> 12:20.042
Yale as my safety school.

12:21.834 --> 12:23.147
Wow, two weeks ago you

12:23.148 --> 12:24.459
couldn't even spell school.

12:25.792 --> 12:28.500
Yeah, that "h" is tricky.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.000
- Anyway, after
- I finish my project,

12:32.042 --> 12:33.542
I think I'll calculate

12:33.543 --> 12:35.042
how many times per hour

12:32.042 --> 12:35.042
I can tell Ravi he's wrong.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.626
(CHUCKLES)

12:36.667 --> 12:37.814
Well, I should probably

12:37.815 --> 12:38.959
tell you not to do that,

12:39.000 --> 12:40.834
but you are voluntarily

12:40.835 --> 12:42.667
doing math, so I'm torn.

12:42.709 --> 12:45.209
You know, getting that

12:45.210 --> 12:47.709
perfect SPAT score

12:42.709 --> 12:47.709
really changed my life.

12:47.751 --> 12:49.147
You're changing your life,

12:49.148 --> 12:50.542
and I'm so proud of you.

Uh, okay, thank you.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.938
I just found out Luke

13:08.939 --> 13:10.792
and Ravi's SPAT

13:07.083 --> 13:10.792
scores were switched.

13:10.834 --> 13:11.939
It was Luke who only

13:11.940 --> 13:13.042
scored a 50.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.418

how much I care,

my score is zero.

I have some news and

we have to keep it

13:35.292 --> 13:37.626
a secret from Luke.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.626
- The only news I want
- to hear about Luke

13:39.667 --> 13:41.147
Is that he is not really

13:41.148 --> 13:42.626
a genius after all.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.042
Actually...

13:44.083 --> 13:46.292
- Oh, how I would rub it
- in his smug, befreckled face.

13:46.334 --> 13:48.188
I would make him rue

13:48.189 --> 13:50.042

Ravi,

14:12.292 --> 14:14.106
just because Luke is smart

14:14.107 --> 14:15.918
doesn't make you

14:12.292 --> 14:15.918
any less intelligent.

14:15.959 --> 14:16.980
In fact, you

14:16.981 --> 14:18.000
should be happy.

to share your interest

So, maybe instead of viewing

14:22.148 --> 14:24.042
Luke as a competitor,

14:24.083 --> 14:25.393
- you should see him
- as a friend.

16:03.585 --> 16:05.375
of a ring tone, Vera.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.834
TTYL.

16:08.876 --> 16:10.000
Mmm-hmm.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.918
- (SOFTLY) Keep going.
- Keep going.

16:13.959 --> 16:15.292
Yes! Happy face.

16:15.334 --> 16:17.334
Sad face. Indifferent face.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.397
Oh, Zuri,

16:19.398 --> 16:21.417
you are my everything!

16:21.459 --> 16:23.459
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, Zuri,

16:23.460 --> 16:25.459
you are my everything!

16:25.500 --> 16:26.792
(CAMERA CLICKING)

16:30.292 --> 16:32.500
Hey, you're stealing my light!

16:32.542 --> 16:34.459
- Well, you're
- stealing my life!

16:35.459 --> 16:37.959
Awkward. Okay!

16:38.000 --> 16:39.876
- Now let's try some shots
- with the wind fan.

16:39.918 --> 16:42.250
Five, six, seven, work!

16:47.083 --> 16:49.375
How's this? And this?

16:49.417 --> 16:51.310
- If I could describe
- this moment in emojis it'd be

16:51.334 --> 16:52.584
Red heart, green heart,

16:52.585 --> 16:53.834
kissy face, top hat!

16:55.083 --> 16:57.959
Top hat seems a little strong.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.209
Zuri, keep this up and it

16:59.210 --> 17:00.417
won't be long

17:00.459 --> 17:02.313
before you're running our teen

17:02.314 --> 17:04.166
fashion department in Paris!

17:04.209 --> 17:05.250
What?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.000
That's my dream!

17:16.917 --> 17:18.751
I can't believe you ruined

17:18.752 --> 17:20.584
my photo shoot.

17:20.626 --> 17:22.291
Thanks a lot, Emma!

17:27.083 --> 17:30.918
Uh-oh! Drama!

17:30.959 --> 17:33.001
Super sad face considering

17:33.002 --> 17:35.042
all the nice things

17:30.959 --> 17:35.042
she said about you.

17:35.083 --> 17:37.083
What do you mean?

17:37.125 --> 17:39.272
Zuri said she gets all of her

17:39.273 --> 17:41.417
style and social skills from

17:37.125 --> 17:41.417
her awesome big sister Emma.

17:41.459 --> 17:43.022
Do you have another,

17:43.023 --> 17:44.584
awesomer sister named Emma?

17:46.125 --> 17:47.376
Why would two sisters have

17:47.377 --> 17:48.626
the same name?

17:48.667 --> 17:50.000
I have two dogs named Cat.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.314
All right, you filthy animals,

17:55.315 --> 17:56.626
I'm coming in there.

17:56.667 --> 17:59.042
- I've already had to
- share this place with a zebra,

17:59.083 --> 18:01.209
A reindeer, a tiger,

18:01.210 --> 18:03.334
a baby giraffe,

17:59.083 --> 18:03.334
and a diva lizard.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.375
So, unless you're

18:04.376 --> 18:05.376
another kid,

18:05.417 --> 18:07.083
you don't scare me.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.000
(GRUNTING)

18:14.626 --> 18:16.334
What are you... Oh!

18:20.417 --> 18:22.542
Bertram, what are you doing?

18:22.584 --> 18:24.584
Me? What are you doing

18:24.585 --> 18:26.584
in the secret room

18:22.584 --> 18:26.584
with all those wild animals?

18:26.626 --> 18:28.506
- What do you mean?
- The kids are all upstairs.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.042
Oh. Oh, right.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.417
Wild animals, yes.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.813
Very scary stuff, but

18:33.814 --> 18:35.167
someone has to feed 'em.

18:35.209 --> 18:37.042
- Do I hear the
- cheese delivery truck?

18:37.083 --> 18:38.709
Nice try.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.876
Everyone knows my

18:39.877 --> 18:41.000
cheese gets delivered

18:38.751 --> 18:41.000
on Wednesdays.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.042
Tell me what you're hiding

18:44.083 --> 18:45.542
or I'll wash your

18:45.543 --> 18:47.000
underwear with Luke's.

18:48.751 --> 18:51.000
(SCOFFS) Okay.

18:54.209 --> 18:56.042
Welcome to my lady cave.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.375
Whoa!

18:58.417 --> 19:00.459
- This is the only room I can
- relax in and not be

19:00.500 --> 19:01.584
Constantly bombarded by

19:01.585 --> 19:02.667
the kids and their needs.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.063
I can't believe you have

19:04.064 --> 19:05.417
a place to hide from the kids

19:05.459 --> 19:07.083
- and you didn't let
- me in on it.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.584
To be fair, I was hiding

19:08.585 --> 19:10.042
from you, too.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.126
So there was

19:11.127 --> 19:12.167
a monster in here.

19:12.209 --> 19:13.417
You!

19:13.459 --> 19:15.042
- Wait, no, no, no.
- Please, please!

19:15.083 --> 19:16.459
Don't tell the kids.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.083
Okay, but it'll cost you.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.793
One night a week in here.

19:20.794 --> 19:22.459
Plus robe privileges!

19:22.500 --> 19:24.709
(SCOFFS) Deal.

19:24.751 --> 19:26.209
- But nobody sits
- in mama's throne.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.500
Oh, hey, Ravi.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.417
- If you've come looking
- for more chips...

19:31.459 --> 19:32.626
I think you ate them all.

19:34.083 --> 19:36.042
No, Luke,

19:36.083 --> 19:37.563
I have come to tell you

19:37.564 --> 19:39.042
I am sorry for being envious

19:36.083 --> 19:39.042
of your intelligence.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.042
- I have been looking at
- this all wrong.

19:41.083 --> 19:43.042
- You have?
- Indeed.

19:43.083 --> 19:45.042
I am glad you are smart.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.876
Jessie pointed out that

19:46.877 --> 19:48.667
I finally have a family member

19:45.083 --> 19:48.667
I can relate to.

19:48.709 --> 19:49.876
All the things

19:49.877 --> 19:51.042
I used to do alone,

19:51.083 --> 19:53.000
we can now do together.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.626
Uh...

19:55.667 --> 19:58.000
What do you mean?

19:58.042 --> 20:00.355
Well, I will not have

20:00.356 --> 20:02.667
to watch The Real Bacteria

19:58.042 --> 20:02.667
of Mold County alone anymore.

20:02.709 --> 20:04.855
And, you can be my plus one

20:04.856 --> 20:07.000
to Gertie, the lunch lady's

20:02.709 --> 20:07.000
50th b-day bash.

20:08.167 --> 20:09.334
Everyone at school

20:09.335 --> 20:10.500
will be calling us

20:10.542 --> 20:11.647
two pisum sativums

20:11.648 --> 20:12.751
in a pod.

20:14.584 --> 20:15.814
Oh, no, that is what

20:15.815 --> 20:17.042
they'll call us, isn't it?

20:17.083 --> 20:18.334
Uh, yes!

20:18.375 --> 20:19.397
Oh, I even made

20:19.398 --> 20:20.417
you a gift!

20:22.167 --> 20:23.292
It is a monogrammed

20:23.293 --> 20:24.417
pocket protector!

20:26.083 --> 20:27.083
Ah!

20:29.083 --> 20:30.355
You stay away

20:30.356 --> 20:31.626
from me with that!

20:31.667 --> 20:33.855
Just because I'm smart

20:33.856 --> 20:36.042
doesn't mean I like

20:31.667 --> 20:36.042
reality mold television!

20:36.083 --> 20:37.459
I wish I'd never scored

20:37.460 --> 20:38.834
so high on that stupid test.

20:38.876 --> 20:40.168
Oh, I am really glad

20:40.169 --> 20:41.459
to hear you say that.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.522
Boys, your SPAT scores

20:43.523 --> 20:45.542
were switched.

20:45.584 --> 20:46.792
BOTH: What?

20:46.834 --> 20:48.210
Yeah. Ravi, you got

20:48.211 --> 20:49.584
a perfect score.

20:49.626 --> 20:50.813
Luke, you filled in your

20:50.814 --> 20:52.000
bubbles with chocolate.

20:53.751 --> 20:54.897
Huzzah!

20:54.898 --> 20:56.042
I am smart again!

20:56.083 --> 20:57.584
(SIGHS)

20:57.626 --> 20:58.668
What a relief!

20:58.669 --> 20:59.709
That homework was

20:57.626 --> 20:59.709
getting annoying.

20:59.751 --> 21:01.042
(CHUCKLES)

21:01.083 --> 21:02.810
- I have two weeks of
- video games to catch up on.

21:02.834 --> 21:05.209
Oh, no you don't.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.667
You've shown that

21:06.668 --> 21:08.083
when you make an effort,

21:05.250 --> 21:08.083
you can get straight A's.

21:08.125 --> 21:09.501
I expect nothing

21:09.502 --> 21:10.876
less from you in the future.

21:10.918 --> 21:12.042
Aw, man!

21:12.083 --> 21:14.042
That's a lot of pressure.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.126
Ravi, is this how

21:15.127 --> 21:16.167
you feel all the time?

21:16.209 --> 21:17.876
Pretty much.

21:17.918 --> 21:18.959
I recommend a night guard

21:18.960 --> 21:20.000
for the constant

21:17.918 --> 21:20.000
teeth grinding.

21:25.292 --> 21:26.876
Zuri?

21:26.918 --> 21:28.167
Are you in there?

21:28.209 --> 21:30.042
ZURI: No!

21:30.083 --> 21:31.209
Okay, I'll go look for

21:31.210 --> 21:32.334
you in the kitchen.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.000
Wait a second...

21:37.959 --> 21:40.083
Zuri, please come out.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.626
I need to talk to you.

21:42.918 --> 21:44.709
What do you want, Emma?

21:44.751 --> 21:45.897
I'm all out of thunder

21:45.898 --> 21:47.042
for you to steal.

21:47.083 --> 21:50.042
Actually, I came to apologize.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.209
I should have just been

21:51.210 --> 21:52.334
happy for you.

21:52.375 --> 21:53.709
But instead, I was

21:53.710 --> 21:55.042
jealous and pretty.

21:55.083 --> 21:56.834
You mean "petty."

21:56.876 --> 21:58.125
That too.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.563
Look, I know you gave

22:00.564 --> 22:02.042
me credit for your style,

22:02.083 --> 22:03.647
and that was

22:03.648 --> 22:05.209
really nice of you.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.085
But the truth is,

22:07.086 --> 22:08.918
you have a great style

22:05.250 --> 22:08.918
of your own

22:08.959 --> 22:10.147
and you deserve to be

22:10.148 --> 22:11.334
the New York It Girl.

22:11.375 --> 22:13.083
You really think so?

22:13.125 --> 22:14.125
Absolutely.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.417
You are

22:16.459 --> 22:18.876
ah-may-zing.

22:18.918 --> 22:20.189
(GIGGLES)

22:20.190 --> 22:21.459
Thank you, Emma.

22:26.584 --> 22:28.480
And I promise to be a much

22:28.481 --> 22:30.375
better big sister

22:26.584 --> 22:30.375
on your next photo shoot.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.375
- (GASPS)
- They're coming back?

22:32.417 --> 22:34.459
Yep.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.310
- I called Pepper and - convinced her
to reshoot - The magazine spread.

22:36.334 --> 22:37.667
Don't worry, this time

22:37.668 --> 22:39.000
I'll stay out of your way.

22:39.042 --> 22:40.667
But you're my inspiration.

22:40.709 --> 22:41.980
I need my

22:41.981 --> 22:43.250
big sister there.

22:43.292 --> 22:44.417
Just maybe dress

22:44.418 --> 22:45.542
down a little.

22:45.584 --> 22:46.752
Okay. I'll wear

22:46.753 --> 22:47.918
my casual tiara.

22:47.959 --> 22:49.710
Oh, good, it will look great

22:49.711 --> 22:51.459
with your black eye.

22:53.417 --> 22:54.959
- Jeans it is.
- (CHUCKLES)

22:58.125 --> 22:59.147
(DINGING)

22:59.148 --> 23:00.167
Oh.

23:00.209 --> 23:01.500
- Your turn.
- Ah!

23:02.542 --> 23:04.751
Ah. This is the life.

23:04.792 --> 23:07.042
- You're right. I'm so relaxed,
- I'm not even bothered

23:07.083 --> 23:09.292
- By the fact that you brought
- cheese-scented candles.

23:10.042 --> 23:12.500
KIDS: Ow! Jessie!

23:12.542 --> 23:14.334
- You should probably
- do something.

23:14.375 --> 23:15.375
You're right.

23:16.292 --> 23:18.083
