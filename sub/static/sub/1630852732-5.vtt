WEBVTT

00:21.021 --> 00:23.106
Hey! I told you to get up.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.734
They're expecting you
in the lab in ten minutes.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.527
Okay, okay.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.252
What? How did you get in here?

00:44.335 --> 00:45.712
I'm in your head.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.300
-Who are you?
-You don't remember me?

00:53.428 --> 00:55.972
You're the kid who was at Dion's school?

00:56.056 --> 00:56.890
Keep going.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.105
We-we don't know each other.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.192
You don't remember me, but I remember you.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.444
You took my dad!

01:09.527 --> 01:11.362
Go!

01:30.006 --> 01:31.216
No, watch out!

01:31.299 --> 01:32.884
That thing, it's coming!

01:33.468 --> 01:34.636
No!

01:34.719 --> 01:35.762
-Brayden.
-Daddy!

01:36.763 --> 01:38.431
-Brayden!
-Daddy!

01:41.392 --> 01:42.227
No!

01:43.144 --> 01:44.521
That's what I remember.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.025
That… That wasn't me. That…

01:49.859 --> 01:51.111
That's not who I am.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.197
People always say that
after they do something awful!

01:54.864 --> 01:56.074
But it was you!

01:56.741 --> 01:58.660
You killed my dad. You killed my aunt.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.203
<i>And that’s not all!</i>

02:04.332 --> 02:05.250
Oh my God.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.756
You have the Crooked Energy.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.263
Okay, okay. Just please, please,

02:19.139 --> 02:20.265
don't give into it.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.101
Fight it, okay?

02:23.184 --> 02:27.147
It feeds on your darkest impulses,
y-y-your jealousy and-and hate.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.983
It-It'll take over your life,
and you don't want that.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.110
You want it!

02:32.944 --> 02:33.903
No, I don't.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.030
I can see inside your head!

02:36.114 --> 02:39.242
The Crooked Energy ruined my life!
Don't come near me!

02:39.325 --> 02:41.619
I told you, I'm in your head!

02:41.703 --> 02:43.163
Well, get out!

02:43.246 --> 02:46.166
Okay. I have to finish
what we came here to do.

02:46.249 --> 02:50.461
If you tell anyone about me,
I'm coming back for you!

03:20.408 --> 03:21.242
We're here!

03:23.453 --> 03:25.914
Complete and total isolation in the woods.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.373
Yay.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.046
Hey, Tevin, guess what?

03:33.129 --> 03:35.965
My granddad built this
with his own hands only.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.592
Yeah? That's pretty cool, man.

03:38.468 --> 03:42.472
That's why everything's so old.
Except those windows. <i>Those</i> are new.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.556
You know how to fish?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.767
We can eat the wildlife
fresh out of the water.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.438
We can also eat Bumblebee Tuna.
Fresh out of the can.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.899
But that's not as fun.
Come on, Tevin.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.486
-Uh--
-Tevin, make sure you two stay together.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.822
Don't worry, Aunt Kat.
It's just the woods. Race ya.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.617
Yeah, with monsters
crawling around Atlanta.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.620
Don't worry.
I got his back.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.026
So I'm looking at Powered DNA?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.069
Well, yes.

04:38.152 --> 04:41.698
So that's a rendered animation
of what's on that slide, yes.

04:41.781 --> 04:46.369
And-- And Powered people,
like Dion, have a triple helix of DNA,

04:47.120 --> 04:49.205
unlike, say, you and I, who have a--

04:49.289 --> 04:52.667
A normal double helix.
Take the mansplaining down a notch?

04:53.626 --> 04:55.128
Sorry, yes. Um…

04:56.129 --> 05:01.134
So my plan is to unwind
Dion's P-DNA strand,

05:01.217 --> 05:04.637
and use it to create a gene therapy
that will neutralize your infection.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.389
That sounds like it could work.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.474
Yeah, I mean, in a weird way,

05:08.558 --> 05:11.352
it's a version of-of what I did
as the Crooked Man.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.563
Come again?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.357
I mean, it's not the same, um, at all.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.358
It's just, uh…

05:17.984 --> 05:18.901
Yeah, no, uh…

05:19.527 --> 05:22.780
What I meant is that it's…
There's, um, uh, just a parallel,

05:22.864 --> 05:26.451
because I needed, uh,
Dion's powers, and now you need--

05:26.534 --> 05:28.369
You should… Just don't. Don't.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.706
You almost killed a child
to save yourself.

05:31.789 --> 05:35.084
That's not the <i>same</i> thing
as using a <i>sample</i> of his DNA.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.420
Yes, okay. Yeah, I know.
I know… You're right.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.298
-I'm not the bad guy here.
-Well, that's to be determined.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.675
-Code Five, coming in.
-Secure the corridor.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.968
-Go!

05:44.052 --> 05:46.429
Get that thing
to the medical lab immediately.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.848
Tranquilize it so we can test it.
Out of the way! Move.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.308
-Suzanne?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.979
Hey, you. Get back in the lab.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.272
Checkpoint, clear.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.691
<i>Prisoner detained.</i>

05:59.692 --> 06:01.069
-Suzanne?

06:01.152 --> 06:04.906
-Get it under control!
-Keep it clear. Steady, steady.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.991
-What's going on?
-Hold up.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.870
They captured this…
This creature from the sinkhole.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.916
Is this what attacked you?

06:17.001 --> 06:18.503
It looked like that, but

06:19.587 --> 06:20.588
mine was way bigger.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.342
You're saying there's more than one?

06:34.477 --> 06:36.896
-It's beautiful out here.
-Yeah, whatever.

06:36.979 --> 06:41.317
There's a stream down there with rocks
and bugs, and sometimes frogs.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.535
Tevin, what's wrong?

06:52.495 --> 06:53.329
Nothing.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.374
Uh, let's head back. Get to work.

06:56.958 --> 06:57.792
Okay.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.049
All right, Di,
up here's gonna be the starting line.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.847
Tevin, I don't wanna play tag.
Tag is for little kids.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.141
It's part of your training, all right?

07:13.641 --> 07:15.143
Come on, race me to the cabin.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.187
Fast as you can.
I'll even give you a head start.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.773
-I don't need a head start.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.776
Confident, huh? It's gonna be
even better when I dust you.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.196
Three, two, one.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.197
Go!

07:34.120 --> 07:34.954
Psych!

07:36.831 --> 07:38.249
You can't catch me!

07:40.793 --> 07:41.752
We'll see.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.379
Ha.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.842
No victory lap till you get to base.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.427
-Where's base?
-Your Auntie Kat.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.137
-Look out for the wall.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.140
<i>Your walls are too slow, bro.</i>

07:56.142 --> 07:57.268
Whoa!

08:04.192 --> 08:05.193
Hey.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.572
-Gotta watch where you're landing.

08:10.990 --> 08:11.824
Didn't see the log?

08:11.908 --> 08:14.660
-I was trying to outrun you.
-Here's lesson number one.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.663
Don't let me or anyone else
knock you off your game.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.416
Otherwise, you'll make mistakes.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.835
-Got it?
-Yeah.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.379
Come on.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.763
<i>Your team any closer to a cure?</i>

08:34.263 --> 08:36.557
I'm on my way to check on Pat's work now.

08:36.641 --> 08:40.603
<i>Excuse me? Pat's working on this too?</i>
<i>Please don't tell me you trust that man.</i>

08:40.686 --> 08:43.606
Nicole's infection is connected
to Pat's Crooked Energy,

08:43.689 --> 08:46.025
and somehow Pat feels what it feels.

08:46.108 --> 08:49.195
<i>-That doesn't raise any red flags for you?</i>
-Of course it does.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.323
But it means he can tell us instantly
what's working and what's not.

08:52.406 --> 08:53.449
<i>He's not a doctor.</i>

08:53.533 --> 08:56.661
<i>Tell him, from a medical standpoint,</i>
<i>he has a few curative options.</i>

08:56.744 --> 09:00.122
He can either neutralize the illness
using the creature's antibodies,

09:00.206 --> 09:01.415
or maybe he could use--

09:01.499 --> 09:04.627
<i>Stop, I'll put you on the phone</i>
<i>with him and you can tell him yourself.</i>

09:04.710 --> 09:07.421
Oh, no, no, no.
I have zero desire to talk to that man.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.551
Yeah, well, we're all working
under less than ideal circumstances,

09:11.634 --> 09:12.802
but this is for Nicole.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.686
-Dr. Neese.
<i>-You figure anything out yet?</i>

09:22.645 --> 09:25.523
Nice to see you too.
Uh, no, I'm still, uh, working on it.

09:25.606 --> 09:29.443
<i>Based on research I did as a resident,</i>
<i>you have a few curative options here.</i>

09:29.527 --> 09:33.447
Okay, th-thank you, Kat, but,
um, I'm working with Powered DNA,

09:33.531 --> 09:36.701
which is significantly more complicated
than anything you studied at med school--

09:36.784 --> 09:39.370
<i>You know what's not complicated?</i>
<i>Your fragile ego.</i>

09:39.453 --> 09:40.663
Kat.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.250
<i>Pat, Nicole is my dearest family,</i>

09:44.333 --> 09:47.003
<i>and you are everything</i>
<i>that has gone wrong in her adult life.</i>

09:47.086 --> 09:50.006
<i>So</i> <i>unless you know</i>
<i>how to cure her at this exact moment,</i>

09:50.089 --> 09:51.841
<i>I suggest you pipe down and listen.</i>

09:51.924 --> 09:55.177
Maybe I'm just having a hard time
hearing over your self-righteousness.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.805
This-- This whole thing's
been pretty hard on me too.

09:57.888 --> 10:02.977
I got possessed, I lost my best friend,
I got rejected, I… I was dead there--

10:03.060 --> 10:05.521
<i>You put down any more</i>
<i>of that "I'm the real victim" crap,</i>

10:05.605 --> 10:08.441
<i>and I will reach through this screen</i>
<i>and end you.</i>

10:09.025 --> 10:12.111
-Okay, why don't we stick to the science?
-<i>Yeah, why don't we?</i>

10:13.487 --> 10:16.407
<i>I think that this case</i>
<i>calls for an antibiotic approach.</i>

10:17.575 --> 10:18.868
Nope. Been there.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.747
My idea is stem-cell therapy
using Powered DNA.

10:24.081 --> 10:27.001
<i>-What power?</i>
I'm still figuring that out.

10:27.084 --> 10:30.087
<i>There is research</i>
<i>with antibiotic therapy using nickel.</i>

10:31.005 --> 10:33.341
You're suggesting I use metal
as an antibiotic?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.384
<i>The metal works as a magnet in the blood.</i>

10:35.468 --> 10:38.763
<i>If you can find a Powered person</i>
<i>with metal manipulation abilities,</i>

10:39.263 --> 10:40.640
<i>you might have an antidote.</i>

10:41.641 --> 10:42.642
That's pretty good.

10:43.934 --> 10:44.769
Um…

10:45.311 --> 10:47.063
<i>Auntie Kat, I'm hungry.</i>

10:47.563 --> 10:50.232
Call me when you have an update. Hi, guys.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.653
<i>-Ass--</i>
Oh, okay. That's… rude.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.697
-Looks like you have your orders.
-Yeah.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.116
We all know how much she loves orders.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.165
That thing used to be human?

11:07.708 --> 11:13.255
I've run blood tests. The sequencing scans
indicate that that creature has human DNA.

11:13.756 --> 11:14.590
Human?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.051
What was that?

11:17.551 --> 11:18.636
As far as I can tell,

11:18.719 --> 11:21.514
those are parasitic spores
that infect the host,

11:21.597 --> 11:24.934
feed off their matter and energy,
and reproduce.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.646
Meaning they're responsible
for turning this man from a human into…

11:28.729 --> 11:29.730
Whatever the hell that is.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.900
Exactly.
And whatever the hell that is

11:32.983 --> 11:35.945
means to make more of itself
by spreading spores.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.948
I'm gonna turn into that.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.325
-You have to lock me away.
-Nicole.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.828
I don't want to make anyone else sick.

11:45.871 --> 11:46.706
Suzanne.

11:47.623 --> 11:48.624
Set up a quarantine.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.376
Okay. I'm on it.

12:08.144 --> 12:08.978
Cut.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.396
Um, uh…

12:13.899 --> 12:14.942
Uh…

12:16.694 --> 12:18.362
Cut. I said, cut.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.574
Ms. Bonnie, that means
cut the accompaniment too.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.289
Esperanza.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.373
Yes?

12:30.374 --> 12:32.501
To understand
your character's motivation,

12:32.585 --> 12:35.379
you must understand
her given circumstances.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.297
Okay.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.883
And what does that mean?

12:38.966 --> 12:39.800
Oh!

12:41.051 --> 12:42.261
You're playing Effie.

12:42.803 --> 12:46.557
One of the most iconic parts
ever written for the musical stage.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.476
Effie has suffered.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.228
She's much more talented
than everybody else.

12:51.854 --> 12:52.938
She's special.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.484
She's plagued by everyone's jealousy.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.736
They call her a diva.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.905
Everyone wants her to go

13:00.988 --> 13:04.074
so they don't have to deal
with her specialness.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.995
It's a curse.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.997
Psst, save me.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.582
Mr. Kwame.

13:11.665 --> 13:16.128
You wanna see a drawing of the stage?
I have all the pyrotechnics in position.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.588
And what is that?

13:17.671 --> 13:19.465
Those are the flame shooters.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.926
You're not gonna
set those off in here, are you?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.221
I mean, this carpet,
it looks very flammable.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.097
I am not presenting my revue

13:27.181 --> 13:31.060
in the drab confines
of this community center, Ms. Bonnie.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.438
Hopefully, the school will be open by then
and we will have a proper stage

13:34.522 --> 13:35.689
on which to perform.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.692
-There's still a fire code.
-Nobody cares about that.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.278
All they care about
is seeing a great show.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.780
And people like fire.

13:43.697 --> 13:44.532
Approved.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.704
Hello there. I'm Effie.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.457
I'm Effie, and, boy, are you lucky.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.502
I'm, like, awesome,
and I'm here to sing for you tonight.

13:56.585 --> 13:57.419
What?

13:57.503 --> 14:00.089
What? You can't handle how special I am?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.341
Well, you're gonna
have a bad day, because…

14:05.344 --> 14:06.971
I'm… great.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.142
Can I tell you something? I'm not great.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.563
I sing a lot at home and my dad likes it,

14:15.646 --> 14:18.232
and I thought he'd like it
if I was on the show,

14:18.315 --> 14:21.151
but now he can't be here,
and I'm really scared,

14:21.235 --> 14:24.280
and everyone expects me
to do this big, amazing thing--

14:24.363 --> 14:26.907
Esperanza, five-minute warning.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.495
I just want to go home.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.884
<i>We're on break, finally.</i>

14:45.384 --> 14:47.261
<i>Mr. Kwame's intense.</i>

14:47.344 --> 14:51.473
Dion, I expect to see results
from your stay-at-home rehearsal.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.516
<i>Okay.</i>

14:54.560 --> 14:57.021
I don't think I can do this, Dion.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.024
<i>-Yes, you can.</i>
-You don't know that.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.777
<i>Remember when you knew</i>
<i>I had superpowers all along?</i>

15:04.278 --> 15:06.405
<i>Well, here's what I know. You got this.</i>

15:07.573 --> 15:08.908
-Okay.
-<i>That's the spirit.</i>

15:09.533 --> 15:11.201
<i>Oh, and also tickets.</i>

15:11.285 --> 15:14.830
<i>Mr. Kwame says that we each get</i>
<i>one free ticket to the show.</i>

15:14.914 --> 15:17.917
Cool. That means your dad
can sit in the front row with my mom.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.753
<i>He's gonna be out of town working.</i>

15:20.836 --> 15:24.465
What? No! He's gonna miss your song?
Can you invite someone else?

15:24.548 --> 15:26.467
Nobody else really cares.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.386
<i>What about… </i><i> Mr. Gary?</i>

15:30.012 --> 15:31.805
<i>Yes! I'll ask Mr. Gary.</i>

15:31.889 --> 15:34.683
And we're back, people.
Look alive.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.601
Thank you.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.520
Dion. These sandwiches
aren't gonna eat themselves.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.147
-Coming!

15:47.821 --> 15:50.783
Why do Black people vacation
in the country anyway?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.744
There could be something out there
lurking in the woods.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.788
Why? Did you see something?

15:56.455 --> 15:59.541
No. I'm just saying,
if horror movies have taught us anything,

15:59.625 --> 16:02.294
there's always something bad
lurking in the woods.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.379
Like zombies?

16:03.462 --> 16:04.588
Or rednecks.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.966
I think we're safe out here.

16:09.343 --> 16:14.181
So my nephew's trainer
is the most eligible Black man on Earth?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.685
Uh, I wouldn't say all that.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.312
I'm not exactly the <i>most </i>eligible.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.648
Way to not answer the question.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.818
Nicole said your superpower
was putting up walls.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.862
I just don't like talking about myself.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.824
-I call that a man with a past.
-I know what you're talking about.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.369
Auntie Kat, I thought you were gay.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.789
-Uh--
-I know it's a spectrum, but still.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.917
I'm not asking for myself, nosy.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.877
I'm just making an observation.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.963
Whatever. You guys are boring.

16:46.588 --> 16:47.589
Uh-uh. Dion.

16:48.966 --> 16:49.800
Line of sight.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.223
-So, what's your deal?
-Deal?

16:57.349 --> 17:00.978
Um… Uh, I'm actually
in a deal-free zone right now.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.604
Sure you are.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.733
All I'm saying is
Nicole is dealing with a lot.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.652
A superkid, a sinkhole monster.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.321
She doesn't have time for the foolishness.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.616
So if you're interested in her,
don't talk about it, be about it.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.621
-Understood.
-Good.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.338
Zombie or redneck?

17:29.631 --> 17:30.466
Uh…

17:31.175 --> 17:35.054
I'm sure it's nothing.
Keep an eye on Dion for me for a second.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.099
Uh, am I the only person
who's seen a horror movie?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.227
Black people
should not walk into the woods.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.202
-<i>Please leave a message.</i>
-Hi, Mom.

17:58.786 --> 18:02.247
I know you're really busy at work,
so I just wanted to call to say hi.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.125
Uh, I didn't really tell you
about my day yesterday.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.419
<i>You know, Brayden,</i>
<i>that kid I hang out with?</i>

18:07.503 --> 18:09.338
<i>He's kind of…</i>

18:11.090 --> 18:11.924
<i>I don't know,</i>

18:12.841 --> 18:14.218
<i>complicated, and…</i>

18:16.512 --> 18:18.806
We'll talk about it
when you call me back.Bye.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.725
Dion. Come over here
where I can see you, buddy.

18:21.809 --> 18:22.893
Okay.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.147
Parasitic infection?

18:28.148 --> 18:29.566
That's worse than I thought.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.402
Who knows how many other people
have been infected by now.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.446
That's why we need to hurry, Pat.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.990
Have you been able to isolate
the gene that controls metal?

18:37.074 --> 18:37.950
Suzanne, I…

18:39.701 --> 18:42.538
I can't even separate
the third strand yet.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.290
Until I do that,
we don't have anything, okay?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.167
So I'm…

18:57.845 --> 18:59.972
Sweetie, I thought
you'd already gone home.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.392
I was grabbing a cookie for the road.
They have some in the kitchen.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.186
-You want one?
-No, thanks. I just have to finish this.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.688
Oh, what is it?

19:08.272 --> 19:11.942
It's an invitation for Mr. Gary
to go see the musical revue.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.277
Oh.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.114
-Mr. Gary, the security guard?
-Mm-hmm.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.116
We're friends. We talk about flowers.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.659
Thus, the flowers.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.870
That's nice.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.208
And there.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.004
Now, all I have to do
is drop it off at the school office.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.340
Oh, sweetie,
the school's closed, remember?

19:35.424 --> 19:36.550
That's why we're here.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.261
Oh, I forgot about that.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.264
How am I supposed
to get this to Mr. Gary now?

19:42.764 --> 19:47.060
I don't know his phone number
or his email address or his Instagram.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.687
Does he even have an Instagram?

19:48.770 --> 19:49.897
Give it to me.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.816
I'll drive it by his house
and put it in his mailbox.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.776
You know where Mr. Gary lives?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.236
Oh.

19:56.820 --> 20:01.366
We carpool to salsa lessons
every Wednesday night.

20:03.744 --> 20:04.578
Oh, what?

20:04.661 --> 20:07.039
We aren't allowed to have lives
outside of school?

20:08.749 --> 20:09.583
Give it.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.087
Thank you.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.006
You're welcome.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.346
-He'll love it.
-Really? You think so?

20:22.429 --> 20:23.263
Mm-hmm.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.101
<i>He's kind of,</i>

20:28.977 --> 20:29.811
<i>I don't know,</i>

20:30.812 --> 20:31.647
<i>complicated.</i>

20:32.564 --> 20:35.108
<i>We'll talk about it</i>
<i>when you call me back. Bye.</i>

20:35.192 --> 20:36.151
There she is.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.404
-Hey, girl. How you doing?

20:40.072 --> 20:40.906
Hanging on.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.659
Did you bring me lunch?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.453
-Tassili's?
-Mm-hmm.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.497
Janelle found that place on her phone.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.917
Said, "We gotta get Ms. Warren
something decent to eat."

20:52.000 --> 20:54.962
I'm like, "Vegan?"
She's like, "Get with Afroism, Mom."

20:56.213 --> 20:57.965
Man, I'm all about Dat Ish Wrap.

20:58.715 --> 21:02.552
So Janelle has gone 12 whole hours
without breaking anything.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.346
I'm not breaking things.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.265
Oh, don't start, Janelle.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.100
Like I don't have eyes.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.435
The sooner she gets control
over these powers,

21:10.519 --> 21:12.396
the sooner we can go home.

21:13.272 --> 21:17.484
Oh, don't worry, baby.
Whatever's going on, I got you.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.237
You don't get me. Nobody does.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.242
We couldn't talk like that
back in the day, huh?

21:25.325 --> 21:26.910
What don't people get about you?

21:29.454 --> 21:30.455
Talk, baby.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.877
Maybe once you figure out
all you can do with your powers…

21:36.545 --> 21:39.881
Apparently, the only thing
I can do is just blow stuff up.

21:43.802 --> 21:49.016
Well, if you could do something different,
what would that look like?

21:53.020 --> 21:55.522
I can see it, but I can't say it.

21:56.106 --> 21:56.940
Try.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.779
It's like I'm inside of it,

22:03.572 --> 22:07.492
and everything is clear and singular,

22:08.035 --> 22:09.494
and I understand.

22:11.830 --> 22:12.789
And I'm part of it.

22:19.796 --> 22:20.714
I believe you.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.974
I'm sure a lot of Powered people
feel how you feel.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.185
Misunderstood.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.440
Maybe you could be their voice.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.484
What do you mean?

22:41.109 --> 22:42.444
BIONA asked me

22:42.527 --> 22:45.364
to speak for the Powered people
on the Advisory Board,

22:45.447 --> 22:47.949
but they should be represented
by one of their own.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.829
Decisions get made
and it matters who's in the room.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.460
Would you agree to representing them?

22:59.503 --> 23:01.630
Assuming it's okay with your mom?

23:01.713 --> 23:02.839
It's up to her.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.219
Yeah.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.136
Good.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.140
-I'll talk to them.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.476
Nicole, hey. Excuse me,
I just need to, um…

23:15.227 --> 23:17.604
So I-I-I've been trying everything.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.858
Everything. I tried
to jury-rig a centrifuge,

23:22.359 --> 23:25.404
to isolate the P-DNA strands
on a molecular level.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.947
I-I have tried and,

23:28.573 --> 23:29.658
I… I can't do it.

23:31.159 --> 23:35.080
Because none of this has ever
been done before, so I-I-I tried, but I…

23:35.831 --> 23:38.750
Maybe I could engineer something
in a week or a month, but…

23:39.376 --> 23:41.920
Maybe if I… If I had the tools, but we…

23:42.879 --> 23:46.299
Oh my God, your infection…
Oh, it's so much worse.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.678
I-I wanna stop that thing from…

23:51.388 --> 23:53.140
I just… I… I need more time.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.400
I-I can't fix it. I'm sorry.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.569
I'm so sorry. I…

24:17.414 --> 24:19.166
Janelle, where are you going?

24:25.589 --> 24:26.882
Janelle, wait!

24:29.301 --> 24:32.262
-Janelle, stop!
-Don't… Don't touch anything!

26:00.559 --> 26:01.434
She…

26:02.269 --> 26:05.146
She did it.
She separated the P-DNA strand. I-I…

26:05.897 --> 26:07.857
I have what I need to make the cure.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.361
Is this what you were trying to do?

26:22.497 --> 26:24.624
Come on,
there's nothing out there.

26:26.960 --> 26:27.794
Okay, Tevin.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.714
You know what this is.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.842
It's just your anxiety, okay?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.553
Get it together.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.514
<i>Kill him. Kill Dion.</i>

26:40.181 --> 26:41.266
<i>He's dangerous.</i>

26:41.766 --> 26:43.852
<i>Kill Dion before he kills you.</i>

26:44.394 --> 26:46.354
<i>He's not who you think.</i>

26:46.438 --> 26:47.272
What?

26:47.355 --> 26:49.691
<i>Dion! He'll kill us all.</i>

26:50.400 --> 26:53.528
<i>He is not what you think.</i>
<i>I have to destroy him.</i>

26:53.612 --> 26:55.363
Tevin!

26:58.408 --> 26:59.367
Dion?

27:00.493 --> 27:02.787
<i>He is not who you think.</i>

27:02.871 --> 27:05.624
Tevin? Dude, are you coming?

27:07.375 --> 27:08.209
Tevin?

27:10.003 --> 27:11.504
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.778
Mom, I didn't know where you went.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.615
So they're still working on a cure.

27:39.157 --> 27:39.991
No news yet.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.037
What you doing?

27:47.374 --> 27:50.085
My daddy never could understand
how he got a daughter

27:50.168 --> 27:51.878
who didn't care about science.

27:53.171 --> 27:57.092
He was an engineer in the Navy,
he taught high school chemistry.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.428
Then I had you.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.847
You loved everything he loved.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.728
He bought me a little science kit
when I was four years old.

28:08.812 --> 28:12.273
It had a microscope and everything.
You remember?

28:13.441 --> 28:16.778
He showed me how to make
a little volcano with baking soda.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.363
Of course I remember.

28:18.446 --> 28:21.032
I cleaned up that mess so many times.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.160
You two were buddies.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.871
He was so proud of you.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.333
So when he asked if he and Mama

28:30.417 --> 28:34.671
could take you to visit his old Navy base
in Iceland to see the Northern Lights,

28:34.754 --> 28:38.591
I said, "Sure,
take my six-year-old to Iceland."

28:40.343 --> 28:42.804
-Well, I wanted you to come too.
-No.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.473
I don't do airplanes.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.769
I was scared to death
every day you were gone.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.398
But not just because it was so far away,

28:55.024 --> 28:55.900
but because

28:56.860 --> 28:57.986
I felt like you were

28:59.654 --> 29:00.780
passing me by.

29:01.614 --> 29:02.449
No.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.659
I was afraid
that trip would change you.

29:06.786 --> 29:07.620
And it did.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.928
The night of the meteor shower

29:25.054 --> 29:27.390
was so beautiful.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.685
And I started crying.

29:31.352 --> 29:36.441
You know, Grandpa told me not to be scared
and it was okay, but I wasn't scared.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.740
I just wanted <i>you</i>
to see what <i>I</i> was seeing.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.998
I don't understand what's happening.

29:52.832 --> 29:54.292
I don't know what to do.

29:54.375 --> 29:57.003
Well, do what you always do.
You're my mom.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.922
Baby, I can't help you with any of this.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.050
So help me with other stuff.

30:02.133 --> 30:02.967
Like what?

30:03.760 --> 30:06.262
Driving you around,
cleaning up the volcanoes?

30:07.597 --> 30:09.140
Well, there's this boy--

30:09.224 --> 30:10.600
Oh, Lord, Janelle.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.436
-What?
-Boys? Really, now?

30:14.229 --> 30:16.105
-I'm almost 16.
-I know, but…

30:17.023 --> 30:19.442
Can we deal with one thing
at a time, please?

30:20.860 --> 30:23.780
I-I just found out
you're some kind of genius.

30:23.863 --> 30:26.574
-And Nicole is sick--
-You know, it's fine. Never mind.

30:27.283 --> 30:28.117
It's cool.

30:29.869 --> 30:31.871
We can talk about it another time, okay?

30:35.250 --> 30:36.709
I'm gonna go check on Nicole.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.092
I love you.

30:53.643 --> 30:57.730
Okay, Dion, lesson number four.
Focusing on elements in your surroundings.

30:58.398 --> 31:01.150
So if you can't do a good skip,
you just throw overhand, like that.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.612
What's the point of this?

31:05.363 --> 31:08.241
Uh, let's just call it
spatial intelligence.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.578
I saw <i>The Karate Kid</i>, okay?

31:12.495 --> 31:14.789
You're supposed to be training me
for something cool.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.459
-Not all super powers are supernatural.
-They're not all super good either.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.045
-What do you mean?

31:21.129 --> 31:21.963
Nothing.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.550
You wanna tell me what's going on?

31:31.848 --> 31:34.726
I want to be good,
but what if I did something that wasn't?

31:37.562 --> 31:38.396
Okay.

31:40.899 --> 31:41.733
I'm listening.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.486
Yesterday, this kid from school
got me to break all my mom's rules.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.407
-This kid got a name?
-Brayden.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.162
Anyway, I wanted to tell my mom,
but she never came home.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.457
I keep calling her,
but she hasn't called me back yet.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.128
It's just… I made a mistake.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.130
I let him knock me off my game,

32:04.213 --> 32:06.925
and now Mom's gonna be so mad,
she's gonna give me the look.

32:07.550 --> 32:08.676
The look?

32:09.469 --> 32:11.054
Damn.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.847
-That is a look.

32:13.473 --> 32:14.515
Tell me about it.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.728
Everyone makes mistakes, Dion.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.355
Not my dad.

32:21.022 --> 32:24.734
-I'm sure he made some before--
-You don't know! You didn't know him.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.655
You're right.

32:29.572 --> 32:31.950
But from what I've heard,
he was an amazing guy.

32:34.786 --> 32:38.790
So let me just speak on myself.
I have made a lot of mistakes.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.794
But I try to learn from 'em
and make different choices.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.296
It's never too late.

32:46.589 --> 32:47.882
What if I'm a bad guy?

32:50.301 --> 32:53.930
-I don't really believe in bad guys.
-What? Of course there are bad guys.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.348
Darth Vader.

32:56.182 --> 32:59.852
Darth Vader turned away
from the dark side before he died,

33:00.436 --> 33:02.939
which shows you
he always had the power to be good.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.780
What exactly happened with this kid?

33:12.448 --> 33:14.409
He kind of got in my head or something.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.912
That's peer pressure.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.251
Come sit.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.970
Look, just because
you get in with the wrong kid

33:34.053 --> 33:35.471
doesn't mean you gotta stay there.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.974
You get to choose.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.392
But I chose wrong.

33:40.018 --> 33:40.977
Then choose again.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.522
<i>Kill him.</i>

33:44.605 --> 33:45.773
-You all right?
-Yeah.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.067
-<i>Do it, Tevin.</i>
Argh.

33:49.068 --> 33:49.902
Tevin?

33:50.486 --> 33:51.863
<i>He's evil.</i>

33:51.946 --> 33:54.949
Argh.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.368
-<i>Destroy him.</i>
-What are you doing?

33:57.452 --> 33:59.662
<i>Before he destroys us all.</i>

34:00.246 --> 34:02.165
<i>You have to do it now!</i>

34:02.248 --> 34:03.166
No!

34:03.249 --> 34:05.585
<i>He wants you dead, Tevin!</i>

34:05.668 --> 34:08.129
-<i>Do it now!</i>

34:08.212 --> 34:09.172
Run!

34:09.255 --> 34:10.715
Run!

34:42.538 --> 34:45.208
<i>P-DNA serum trial dose</i>
<i>now administered.</i>

34:49.295 --> 34:50.963
Is that supposed to happen?

34:52.173 --> 34:54.050
You mean with the serum we just made up

34:54.133 --> 34:56.219
that's never been tested
on anything before?

35:01.682 --> 35:03.267
<i>Blood pressure's stabilizing.</i>

35:03.851 --> 35:04.936
<i>Check C4s.</i>

35:05.019 --> 35:06.771
<i>Heart rate stable.</i>
<i>Run all vitals.</i>

35:06.854 --> 35:07.855
<i>Running vitals.</i>

35:07.939 --> 35:09.774
<i>I'm seeing</i>
<i>a decline in the infection.</i>

35:10.274 --> 35:11.692
<i>Do you see the blood gas levels?</i>

35:12.985 --> 35:16.614
<i>My goodness, I think it's working.</i>
<i>He's regaining consciousness.</i>

35:20.618 --> 35:23.204
Help me, please.

35:23.704 --> 35:25.581
I need to tell you…

35:33.965 --> 35:35.174
<i>Ah, he's gone.</i>

35:38.886 --> 35:39.720
No.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.140
No.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.101
No.

36:18.718 --> 36:19.552
Get off!

36:20.178 --> 36:21.554
Get off me!

36:21.637 --> 36:22.555
Get…
