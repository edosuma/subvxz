WEBVTT

00:06.621 --> 00:08.087
Did you get any sleep?

00:08.089 --> 00:11.491
Oh, a couple minutes
here and there. You?

00:11.492 --> 00:14.461
No, I kept waking up from
nightmares about Russia

00:14.462 --> 00:16.229
infiltrating the top
levels of our government.

00:16.230 --> 00:18.064
- Mm.
- More coffee?

00:18.065 --> 00:19.766
Sure.

00:19.767 --> 00:21.902
I'm already on my second pot.

00:21.903 --> 00:25.872
So have you found any reason
not to suspect the Gang of Eight?

00:25.873 --> 00:28.408
Besides the fact that they're
the most powerful members

00:28.409 --> 00:30.877
of Congress and it would be
treason for any one of them

00:30.878 --> 00:33.313
to share our secrets with Russia? Nah.

00:33.314 --> 00:36.149
I've had my team working
on it all night, too.

00:36.150 --> 00:37.250
Eggs?

00:37.251 --> 00:40.654
No. I'm feeling carby.

00:40.655 --> 00:44.524
You'll want rock-solid proof

00:44.525 --> 00:46.359
before you take it up the chain.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.195
Yeah, I was thinking that
I would brief the committee

00:49.196 --> 00:51.097
on a fake op in Afghanistan.

00:51.098 --> 00:53.133
See if there was any Taliban response.

00:53.134 --> 00:54.434
A drip test.

00:54.435 --> 00:55.702
Right, drip test.

00:55.703 --> 00:58.470
I like it.

01:01.274 --> 01:02.876
But I don't like this.

01:02.877 --> 01:05.779
"White House. Now."

01:05.780 --> 01:07.212
Fresh nightmares.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.907
CDC just finished
tabulating overdose deaths

01:10.908 --> 01:11.974
from last year.

01:11.975 --> 01:13.075
How bad?

01:13.076 --> 01:14.510
Record-breaking.

01:14.511 --> 01:16.379
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,

01:16.380 --> 01:18.681
but shouldn't you have called
in a different cabinet member?

01:18.682 --> 01:19.782
The president already had

01:19.783 --> 01:22.185
the secretary of Health
and Human Services

01:22.186 --> 01:24.286
in the Oval this morning.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.990
Russell?

01:27.991 --> 01:30.393
Harrison's back in rehab.

01:30.394 --> 01:31.794
Oh, no.

01:31.795 --> 01:33.196
Ah, he's okay.

01:33.197 --> 01:35.759
Checked himself in last
week before he spiraled.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.560
Even managed to keep it out of the news,

01:37.561 --> 01:40.864
but when Conrad saw the CDC report...

01:40.865 --> 01:42.365
it became a busy morning.

01:42.366 --> 01:44.600
Do you know what he wants from me?

01:45.368 --> 01:47.502
Revenge.

01:49.539 --> 01:51.306
Good morning, Mr. President.

01:53.810 --> 01:55.578
Do you know how many American servicemen

01:55.579 --> 01:56.980
died in Vietnam, Bess?

01:56.981 --> 02:00.750
Uh, 58,000...

02:00.751 --> 02:02.685
58,220.

02:02.686 --> 02:04.521
In a war that lasted
more than ten years.

02:04.522 --> 02:06.356
Do you know how many Americans

02:06.357 --> 02:07.957
died of drug overdoses last year?

02:07.958 --> 02:09.859
- Well...
- 64,000.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.895
Mostly from opioids.

02:11.896 --> 02:14.697
It's the worst public
health crisis in a century.

02:14.698 --> 02:18.067
And it's happening on my watch.

02:18.068 --> 02:21.270
So I'm going to do something about it.

02:22.438 --> 02:25.341
Sergio Macias. You familiar?

02:25.342 --> 02:28.011
He's head of the Puebla
Cartel in Southern Mexico.

02:28.012 --> 02:30.013
He's in prison in Jalisco,

02:30.014 --> 02:32.816
but he's running things from his cell.

02:32.817 --> 02:34.384
That's why I want him
extradited to the U.S.

02:34.385 --> 02:35.718
and put into supermax.

02:35.719 --> 02:38.221
I'm not sure that's the right play, sir.

02:38.222 --> 02:39.656
Why the hell not?

02:39.657 --> 02:41.558
More than 90% of our
heroin comes from Mexico,

02:41.559 --> 02:43.560
and most of that from Macias.

02:43.561 --> 02:45.795
We extradite him, it'll
cripple his empire.

02:45.796 --> 02:48.565
And some new drug lord takes his place.

02:48.566 --> 02:51.167
If you want to focus on Mexico,

02:51.168 --> 02:53.570
we should focus on
government corruption.

02:53.571 --> 02:56.272
So you are content to let
Macias keep killing Americans?

02:56.273 --> 02:59.309
State's been holding talks

02:59.310 --> 03:04.480
with Mexico about new
anti-corruption measures,

03:04.481 --> 03:06.349
but it's delicate.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.852
If we push them to give up Macias,

03:08.853 --> 03:11.487
they won't want to cut any other deals.

03:11.488 --> 03:13.389
Fighting corruption is a noble goal,

03:13.390 --> 03:15.992
but I want Macias out of the equation.

03:15.993 --> 03:19.729
Opioid deaths are a systemic problem,

03:19.730 --> 03:21.631
a tragic one.

03:21.632 --> 03:24.234
So it's understandable
to want to find...

03:24.235 --> 03:27.136
We've known each other
a long time, Bess.

03:27.137 --> 03:28.605
You can talk to me straight.

03:28.606 --> 03:34.110
Russell told me about
Harrison, and I am, I'm so sorry

03:34.111 --> 03:36.878
for what you and Lydia
are going through.

03:38.681 --> 03:40.350
I'm worried that maybe

03:40.351 --> 03:41.951
it's clouding your judgment.

03:41.952 --> 03:43.519
Well, I understand your concern,

03:43.520 --> 03:46.189
but this isn't just about my son.

03:46.190 --> 03:47.724
I meet with families

03:47.725 --> 03:50.293
who've lost loved ones to
drugs almost every week.

03:50.294 --> 03:52.362
I can't keep giving them platitudes.

03:52.363 --> 03:54.197
I want decisive action today.

03:54.198 --> 03:56.399
Are we clear?

03:56.400 --> 03:59.235
Yes, Mr. President.

03:59.236 --> 04:00.637
- Morning.
- Good morning, ma'am.

04:00.638 --> 04:02.702
Uh, your call with the Mexican
secretary of foreign affairs

04:02.703 --> 04:05.408
- is in five minutes.
- Thanks. Are you okay?

04:05.409 --> 04:07.176
Yes. Why?

04:07.177 --> 04:09.379
Well, your blazer is unbuttoned.

04:09.380 --> 04:10.513
Oh, God.

04:10.514 --> 04:11.748
I'm so sorry.

04:11.749 --> 04:13.082
- No, that's not what I...
- It's, uh...

04:13.083 --> 04:14.284
...mean. It's, um, I'm just all...

04:14.285 --> 04:16.452
My parents are flying
into D.C. tomorrow.

04:16.452 --> 04:18.588
- Oh! Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:18.589 --> 04:20.589
That's... always a little challenging.

04:20.591 --> 04:22.547
- Yeah. Look, I-I love them
- I mean, I'm sure.

04:22.548 --> 04:23.593
More than anyone in the world.

04:23.594 --> 04:26.195
It's just... oh, sometimes
they make me so mad

04:26.196 --> 04:28.798
I want to rip the skin off my own face.

04:28.799 --> 04:31.467
Does that make sense?

04:31.468 --> 04:34.170
Yeah, I try not to
think about what my kids

04:34.171 --> 04:36.873
- think of me sometimes.
- Well, I doubt that you question

04:36.874 --> 04:39.409
their career and relationship
choices at every turn,

04:39.410 --> 04:41.911
- so I'm sure you're fine.
- How can they question your career choice?

04:41.912 --> 04:42.944
Well...

04:42.945 --> 04:45.548
You are literally
helping save the world.

04:45.549 --> 04:47.817
My parents are private sector people.

04:47.818 --> 04:50.954
They... To their mind, leaving finance

04:50.955 --> 04:53.957
to go work for the government
was like blasting a fire hose

04:53.958 --> 04:56.893
full of money off a
cliff into the abyss.

04:56.894 --> 04:59.529
Well, if they saw what you did,

04:59.530 --> 05:01.754
they'd be bragging to all your friends,

05:01.755 --> 05:02.465
- Well, I...
- all their friends.

05:02.466 --> 05:03.641
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on.

05:03.642 --> 05:04.934
You know what, bring 'em in.

05:04.935 --> 05:06.699
What? Oh, no. Thank you.

05:06.700 --> 05:07.879
- That's very kind of you. I...
- Yeah. No.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.405
We have been in this
relationship for years.

05:09.406 --> 05:13.141
It's time I met your parents, Blake.

05:15.511 --> 05:18.081
You are aware that Macias is in prison

05:18.082 --> 05:20.249
in Jalisco, Madam Secretary?

05:20.250 --> 05:21.517
Of course you are.

05:21.518 --> 05:23.519
You just don't trust our justice system.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.788
Secretary Gomez, I assure you

05:25.789 --> 05:29.459
this request is solely about
the U.S. justice system.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.829
Macias is wanted in seven states.

05:32.830 --> 05:35.498
He has indictments from nine

05:35.499 --> 05:36.466
federal courts.

05:36.467 --> 05:38.534
He is also a Mexican citizen,

05:38.535 --> 05:41.004
convicted by the Mexican judiciary.

05:41.005 --> 05:43.139
But why should you
respect our sovereignty?

05:43.140 --> 05:45.475
We have great respect for Mexico.

05:45.476 --> 05:49.445
In fact, I can guarantee
we will honor your laws

05:49.446 --> 05:51.781
and Macias won't face the death penalty.

05:51.782 --> 05:52.982
That is a start.

05:52.983 --> 05:55.118
But to even consider this deal,

05:55.119 --> 05:58.688
President Zaragoza wants
new trade provisions.

05:58.689 --> 06:01.924
Lift the restrictions on
cybersecurity software.

06:01.925 --> 06:04.660
Well, the Pentagon
doesn't give cyberweapons

06:04.661 --> 06:06.796
to any foreign country.

06:06.797 --> 06:08.664
I'm not talking about your military.

06:08.665 --> 06:10.166
Private companies.

06:10.167 --> 06:13.336
You have many burdensome
regulations around cyber trade

06:13.337 --> 06:14.337
with Mexico.

06:14.338 --> 06:15.805
Well, for good reason.

06:15.806 --> 06:17.840
Do you have any idea how hard it is

06:17.841 --> 06:20.443
to keep cyberweapons
away from bad actors?

06:20.444 --> 06:24.881
That is a rather galling lack
of faith for a close ally.

06:24.882 --> 06:27.784
It is a well-documented
fact that American guns

06:27.785 --> 06:29.952
have made their way to cartel hands.

06:29.953 --> 06:33.956
And a gun is a lot easier to
keep safe than a string of code.

06:33.957 --> 06:37.126
Once again, you know
what is best for Mexico.

06:37.127 --> 06:40.163
Can you just knock that off?

06:40.164 --> 06:42.632
I assure you that I am negotiating

06:42.633 --> 06:44.735
- in good faith.
- But we have nothing to negotiate.

06:44.736 --> 06:46.402
President Dalton wants Macias.

06:46.403 --> 06:48.438
Cyber is a priority
for President Zaragoza.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.740
You need to make it work. Or no deal.

06:50.741 --> 06:53.676
And tell your anti-corruption
unit to stand down.

06:53.677 --> 06:55.745
My government is no longer in the mood

06:55.746 --> 06:58.281
to be educated by your bureaucrats.

06:58.282 --> 06:59.649
Sec...

06:59.650 --> 07:01.950
...retary.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:36.119 --> 07:37.920
Great news, ma'am.

07:37.921 --> 07:39.956
Uh, it's more like insanely
amazing news. Go ahead.

07:39.957 --> 07:42.358
Kat found some ironclad
security guarantees for

07:42.359 --> 07:43.868
- our cyberweaponry.
- Cyberweaponry.

07:43.869 --> 07:44.886
President Zaragoza will sign

07:44.887 --> 07:46.363
the extradition
agreement within the hour.

07:46.364 --> 07:48.331
Apologies. I promise this is
enthusiasm, not impertinence.

07:48.332 --> 07:50.038
- Understood.
- That is great.

07:50.039 --> 07:53.169
And insanely amazing.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.938
Ma'am, Miguel Briseño from
the Washington Chronicle is here

07:55.939 --> 07:57.440
- for your interview.
- Mexican bureau chief?

07:57.441 --> 07:59.809
I'll be there in a second.

07:59.810 --> 08:00.810
Details.

08:00.811 --> 08:03.112
- It was all Ms. Sandoval.
- Oh.

08:03.113 --> 08:04.413
Well, let's hear it.

08:04.414 --> 08:06.749
No, I just, uh, asked INR to find

08:06.750 --> 08:08.784
the American cybersecurity
firm that Mexico wants

08:08.785 --> 08:10.887
to contract, Kizlet
Programming, and then I made

08:10.888 --> 08:13.523
a super solid deal with
their CEO, Kenny Fisk.

08:13.524 --> 08:15.791
He guaranteed that
any tech Kizlet shares

08:15.792 --> 08:18.828
will be completely traceable
and can be disabled remotely

08:18.829 --> 08:20.396
at a moment's notice.
CYBERCOM signed off

08:20.397 --> 08:22.398
in, like, five seconds.
It was barely even a thing.

08:22.399 --> 08:25.635
Usually, those private
sector guys, they hate working

08:25.636 --> 08:27.270
- with the government.
- Tell me about it.

08:27.271 --> 08:29.205
So I Facebooked Fisk.

08:29.206 --> 08:31.374
Found he's deep into Neal Stephenson.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.109
That doesn't ring a bell.

08:33.110 --> 08:34.409
Yeah. No. Sci-Fi author.

08:34.410 --> 08:35.678
He wrote Cryptonomicon.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.346
- No.
- Anathem?

08:37.347 --> 08:40.216
- Mm.
- Um, Seveneves.

08:40.217 --> 08:41.250
Wow.

08:41.251 --> 08:43.186
Still no bells? Okay.

08:43.187 --> 08:44.921
Now I know your Christmas gift.

08:44.922 --> 08:48.324
Anyway, Fisk and I were
way in the weeds about

08:48.325 --> 08:50.426
the reconstructed society aboard
the Cloud Ark in Seveneves.

08:50.427 --> 08:54.296
So, now he's pretty much
my little nerd buddy.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.100
It's all about relationships, right?

08:59.835 --> 09:02.438
Good job, Kat.

09:02.439 --> 09:04.939
Thank you, ma'am.

09:05.575 --> 09:07.777
I actually have

09:07.778 --> 09:09.378
some breaking news for you.

09:09.379 --> 09:10.746
Hmm.

09:10.747 --> 09:13.149
President Zaragoza is moments away

09:13.150 --> 09:15.785
from signing an extradition agreement.

09:15.786 --> 09:19.388
Sergio Macias is coming
to the United States.

09:19.389 --> 09:22.191
Did Mexico demand any concessions?

09:22.192 --> 09:24.893
Yes, of course.

09:26.195 --> 09:29.298
We've agreed to relax some of our...

09:29.299 --> 09:31.934
trade provisions around...

09:31.935 --> 09:33.502
cybersecurity software.

09:33.503 --> 09:35.671
Defensive software or cyberweaponry?

09:35.672 --> 09:38.474
I'm not really prepared to
comment about that yet...

09:38.475 --> 09:41.711
Are you concerned that if Mexico
obtains American cyberweapons,

09:41.712 --> 09:44.981
they might fall into
the hands of bad actors?

09:44.982 --> 09:48.484
No, we have faith in
the Mexican government.

09:48.485 --> 09:49.752
Really?

09:49.753 --> 09:51.320
You've had guarantees before,

09:51.321 --> 09:52.755
and yet American guns

09:52.756 --> 09:54.724
have still got into the
hands of cartel members.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.592
Other than trade provisions,

09:56.593 --> 10:00.496
does the U.S. have any
solutions to fight the cartels?

10:00.497 --> 10:02.765
I mean, after all, it is...

10:02.766 --> 10:05.968
government corruption
that allows them to thrive.

10:05.969 --> 10:09.438
We've been advising President Zaragoza

10:09.439 --> 10:12.475
to pursue anti-corruption measures.

10:12.476 --> 10:14.442
And, off the record...

10:21.151 --> 10:23.918
You're not wrong.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.855
Excuse me?

10:27.657 --> 10:29.592
We're never gonna beat the cartels

10:29.593 --> 10:32.995
as long as Mexican government
officials stay on their payroll.

10:32.996 --> 10:35.031
What more can the U.S. do?

10:35.032 --> 10:36.666
Mexico is our neighbor

10:36.667 --> 10:40.169
and one of our most reliable
allies and trade partners.

10:40.170 --> 10:42.071
We can't just...

10:42.072 --> 10:45.441
force them into rooting out corruption.

10:45.442 --> 10:49.111
It's like having a best friend
who won't stop robbing banks.

10:49.112 --> 10:52.782
We are doing everything we can,

10:52.783 --> 10:54.817
but...

10:54.818 --> 10:58.521
thankfully, there are
tough reporters like you

10:58.522 --> 11:01.223
who are holding the Mexican
government accountable.

11:01.224 --> 11:02.825
Because ultimately,

11:02.826 --> 11:05.394
I think it just might
be the Fourth Estate

11:05.395 --> 11:07.762
that brings about change.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.890
_

11:21.405 --> 11:23.287
_

11:23.288 --> 11:26.264
_

11:26.694 --> 11:28.348
_

11:30.071 --> 11:31.279
_

11:31.521 --> 11:33.160
_

11:33.161 --> 11:35.290
_

12:29.745 --> 12:36.024
Subtitle sync and corrections by

12:40.086 --> 12:41.785
The extradition was rushed.

12:41.786 --> 12:43.935
All due respect, President Zaragoza,

12:43.936 --> 12:46.171
but I don't see how more
time would have stopped

12:46.172 --> 12:47.823
a helicopter loaded with RPGs.

12:47.824 --> 12:50.142
Well, then perhaps it
never should have happened.

12:50.143 --> 12:53.142
21 Federales were killed in the attack.

12:53.143 --> 12:54.910
I am sorry.

12:54.911 --> 12:57.046
Their loss is a tragedy.

12:57.047 --> 12:59.915
I pledge our full support in
bringing Macias to justice.

12:59.916 --> 13:03.653
We're already coordinating
with your DEA in Mexico City.

13:03.654 --> 13:06.956
I have instructed them to
provide whatever resources

13:06.957 --> 13:10.226
you need for the search,
but... our cyberweapons deal

13:10.227 --> 13:13.628
is suspended until the
extradition is back on track.

13:14.897 --> 13:19.235
The cartels undermine
our relationship, Conrad.

13:19.236 --> 13:21.971
In many ways. I regret that.

13:21.972 --> 13:23.406
So do I.

13:23.407 --> 13:26.841
But I'll feel a lot better
when Macias is back in prison.

13:27.576 --> 13:29.445
We will keep you apprised.

13:29.446 --> 13:31.279
Thank you, Mario.

13:33.517 --> 13:35.450
That was awkward.

13:36.452 --> 13:38.321
After a deep investigative dive

13:38.322 --> 13:41.023
into each member of the Gang of Eight,

13:41.024 --> 13:43.259
we have three winners for
most Russia connections:

13:43.260 --> 13:46.362
Senate Majority Leader Beau Carpenter,

13:46.363 --> 13:47.863
Representative Drew Emerick,

13:47.864 --> 13:49.065
Senator Carlos Morejon.

13:49.066 --> 13:51.667
An all-star list of D.C. powerhouses.

13:51.668 --> 13:53.736
Nothing illegal

13:53.737 --> 13:55.771
vis-à-vis Russia, but connected enough

13:55.772 --> 13:58.007
that it could point to something more.

13:58.008 --> 13:59.742
Our plan is to send

13:59.743 --> 14:01.644
a classified brief to each congressman

14:01.645 --> 14:04.046
saying high-level
intelligence agents are meeting

14:04.047 --> 14:06.215
in Afghanistan day after tomorrow,

14:06.216 --> 14:07.350
4:00 Afghan time.

14:07.351 --> 14:08.384
We give each congressman

14:08.385 --> 14:09.952
a different location for the meeting.

14:09.953 --> 14:11.319
So for Emerick...

14:12.221 --> 14:13.689
...it's in Kunar Province.

14:13.690 --> 14:15.925
Morejon...

14:15.926 --> 14:17.693
Parwan.

14:17.694 --> 14:19.128
Carpenter...

14:19.129 --> 14:21.097
Nimruz.

14:21.098 --> 14:23.095
We'll fly surveillance
drones over each location.

14:23.096 --> 14:26.035
- If we see a Taliban presence...
- We'll have our Judas Iscariot.

14:26.036 --> 14:28.069
Let's go ahead, see what we get.

14:31.574 --> 14:34.176
What gorgeous walnut paneling.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.811
Imagine it with something brighter.

14:35.812 --> 14:37.580
That'd just open it right up.

14:37.581 --> 14:40.249
Oh, so, does State have anything to do

14:40.250 --> 14:42.284
with catching this cartel guy, Macias?

14:42.285 --> 14:44.320
I can't answer any
classified questions, Dad.

14:44.321 --> 14:45.788
- Ah.
- That's a yes.

14:45.789 --> 14:48.057
Okay,

14:48.058 --> 14:50.860
- here's a D.C. insider question for you.
- Mm-hmm?

14:50.861 --> 14:52.128
What do you think of Shaw?

14:52.129 --> 14:53.396
Is that an up-and-coming neighborhood?

14:53.397 --> 14:54.430
Oh, it's arrived.

14:54.431 --> 14:56.432
The streets are lined with gastropubs.

14:56.433 --> 14:59.101
Ah. We're thinking
of, uh, buying a condo

14:59.102 --> 15:00.169
- as an investment.
- What?

15:00.170 --> 15:02.938
The real estate market
here is very spicy.

15:02.939 --> 15:04.340
Oh. Uh, well, yeah.

15:04.341 --> 15:05.708
I mean, Shaw's fantastic.

15:05.709 --> 15:07.676
It's... This is my
desk, by the way. Mom.

15:07.677 --> 15:09.545
- Oh.
- Um, yeah, Shaw's really pretty,

15:09.546 --> 15:12.148
um, it's close to the metro, it's...

15:12.149 --> 15:13.516
Yeah, it's great.

15:13.517 --> 15:15.418
Well, how would you...

15:15.419 --> 15:16.952
like to live there?

15:16.953 --> 15:20.456
Why, I'd love to, but...

15:20.457 --> 15:22.591
Are you buying me a condo?

15:22.592 --> 15:24.293
Like a PlayStation for my birthday?

15:24.294 --> 15:25.628
Oh, we're buying it anyway.

15:25.629 --> 15:27.763
- Yeah, don't touch.
- Now, if you want

15:27.764 --> 15:30.900
to contribute, you can just
give us what you pay in rent now.

15:30.901 --> 15:32.701
Yeah, the open house is tomorrow.

15:32.702 --> 15:34.837
Okay, this is feeling like charity.

15:34.838 --> 15:36.038
Well, you're the one who said

15:36.039 --> 15:37.506
your apartment was a "postage stamp."

15:37.507 --> 15:39.408
Y-Yeah, but it's my postage stamp.

15:39.409 --> 15:42.645
- And I pay fair-market value for it.
- We just thought

15:42.646 --> 15:44.713
you would like a
thousand-square-foot...

15:44.714 --> 15:45.748
- Two-bedroom.
- ...two-bedroom

15:45.749 --> 15:47.016
with a walk-in closet.

15:47.017 --> 15:48.684
- Yeah.
- Hardwood floors.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.921
When's the open house?

15:51.922 --> 15:53.422
Well, there's no mistaking it...

15:53.423 --> 15:54.790
you must be Fred and Edie Moran.

15:54.791 --> 15:56.158
- Yes?
- Mom, Dad, this is, um,

15:56.159 --> 15:57.660
Elizabeth... Secretary McCord.

15:57.661 --> 15:59.728
- So nice to meet you. Elizabeth...
- Madam Secre... something.

15:59.729 --> 16:00.577
Secretary McCord.

16:00.578 --> 16:02.932
We've heard so many
wonderful things about you.

16:02.933 --> 16:04.633
Oh. Well, thank you. I've...

16:04.634 --> 16:06.235
Oh. Kat?

16:06.236 --> 16:09.038
Kat Sandoval, my new policy advisor.

16:09.039 --> 16:11.006
- And Matt Mahoney, my speechwriter.
- Hi.

16:11.007 --> 16:12.341
- Hi.
- My parents.

16:12.342 --> 16:14.276
- Oh. Hello.
- Hi, Blake's mom.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.445
I'm amazed at how large this place is.

16:16.446 --> 16:18.380
How many employees?

16:18.381 --> 16:19.682
I think 30,000.

16:19.683 --> 16:22.618
Well, Kat just joined us, so 30,001.

16:22.619 --> 16:23.510
Ah.

16:23.511 --> 16:24.927
That's a lot of pension
and health plans.

16:24.928 --> 16:26.422
No wonder you can't pay much up front.

16:26.423 --> 16:27.356
Dad.

16:27.357 --> 16:28.724
What? What? Sh-She's aware.

16:28.725 --> 16:30.226
Oh, well, it's a living wage.

16:30.227 --> 16:33.262
But you're absolutely right...
it doesn't nearly match

16:33.263 --> 16:34.697
the value of our employees.

16:34.698 --> 16:35.764
Yup.

16:35.765 --> 16:36.732
I mean, uh...

16:36.733 --> 16:38.467
uh, yeah, it's a shame.

16:38.468 --> 16:40.803
- But it's a good stepping-stone, right?
- Yeah, stepping-stone.

16:40.804 --> 16:42.605
All right, let's go...
let's go, uh, this way.

16:42.606 --> 16:44.507
- This way...
- You know, I just wanted to say

16:44.508 --> 16:46.675
that Blake is one of
the most capable people

16:46.676 --> 16:47.810
I've ever worked with.

16:47.811 --> 16:50.779
The sky is the limit for a guy like him.

16:50.780 --> 16:53.115
So in-in D.C. terms,
that's low six figures?

16:53.116 --> 16:55.317
All right, nice to meet you.
Here we go. Going this way.

16:56.820 --> 16:58.521
- That's Jay. My parents.
- Hi. Great to meet you.

16:58.522 --> 16:59.755
- Sorry, I have to...
- Yep.

16:59.756 --> 17:01.156
There's something you need to see.

17:01.157 --> 17:03.191
What's going on?

17:04.313 --> 17:05.441
_

17:07.248 --> 17:10.517
_

17:13.335 --> 17:15.503
Two-thirds of our continent
is looking for this guy,

17:15.505 --> 17:17.873
and he gives an interview
to an American newspaper.

17:17.874 --> 17:19.508
Well, I don't think
too many cautious types

17:19.509 --> 17:21.909
end up becoming drug lords.

17:27.117 --> 17:29.485
Hell of a scoop.

17:29.486 --> 17:32.421
Briseño's more
impressive than I thought.

17:32.422 --> 17:34.123
Um, this interview

17:34.124 --> 17:36.492
isn't even all of it...
he wrote this long exposé

17:36.493 --> 17:38.260
on corruption in the drug war.

17:38.261 --> 17:39.862
He names Mexican
politicians on the take,

17:39.863 --> 17:42.164
U.S. border agents
who look the other way.

17:42.165 --> 17:44.833
He even lays out how
Macias gets American guns.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.136
Macias can't be too happy about that.

17:47.137 --> 17:48.938
Yeah.

17:48.939 --> 17:50.439
Yeah, Macias and his ilk

17:50.440 --> 17:53.309
are only happy when
inflicting pain and suffering.

17:53.310 --> 17:55.511
They kill and rape without compunction,

17:55.512 --> 17:57.880
they wreak generations of trauma

17:57.881 --> 17:59.014
wherever they gain influence.

17:59.015 --> 18:02.685
And if I told you of
the grotesque crimes

18:02.686 --> 18:04.954
that the cartel's committed
in the idyllic little...

18:04.955 --> 18:07.222
Oaxacan town where my father grew up,

18:07.223 --> 18:09.358
we would all be lying on the floor,

18:09.359 --> 18:11.293
huddled in the fetal position,

18:11.294 --> 18:13.728
weeping like frightened toddlers.

18:17.733 --> 18:20.169
Buy me a drink, and I'll
tell you how I really feel.

18:20.170 --> 18:23.105
Ma'am. The president wants to see you.

18:26.742 --> 18:28.877
How many more times can Sergio Macias

18:28.878 --> 18:30.579
stick his thumb in my eye?

18:30.580 --> 18:33.082
The Justice Department will
get into it with this reporter,

18:33.083 --> 18:34.350
shake something loose.

18:34.351 --> 18:37.052
I wouldn't count on him
giving up his sources.

18:37.053 --> 18:39.205
Well, maybe a contempt
citation will make him rethink

18:39.206 --> 18:42.124
- his principles.
- It won't. I've met him.

18:42.125 --> 18:43.826
Then we fight him in court.

18:43.827 --> 18:45.094
He can't invoke reporter's privilege

18:45.095 --> 18:46.295
if it's a criminal case.

18:46.296 --> 18:49.765
And by the time we get a
ruling, it'll be too late.

18:49.766 --> 18:51.166
Let me talk to him.

18:51.167 --> 18:53.836
- I think I can get him to cooperate.
- And why is that?

18:53.837 --> 18:56.170
We bonded.

18:59.174 --> 19:01.377
Look, I couldn't tell
you where he was hiding

19:01.378 --> 19:02.611
if I wanted to.

19:02.612 --> 19:04.913
They blindfolded me and
put headphones over my ears.

19:04.914 --> 19:06.515
Well, you could...

19:06.516 --> 19:09.418
give me the device you recorded him on.

19:09.419 --> 19:12.888
It is not my job to make things
easier for powerful people.

19:12.889 --> 19:14.089
That's true.

19:14.090 --> 19:16.458
But your principles won't save you

19:16.459 --> 19:19.261
when you're arrested
for contempt of court.

19:19.262 --> 19:21.764
AG could have you on an FBI plane

19:21.765 --> 19:23.399
back to Washington tonight.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.768
No, I-I... I need more
time before that happens.

19:25.769 --> 19:27.502
More time to do what?

19:28.203 --> 19:29.805
I can't say.

19:29.806 --> 19:34.242
But it's the kind of reporting
that could really change things.

19:44.987 --> 19:47.122
You're living dangerously.

19:47.123 --> 19:49.224
Excuse me?

19:49.225 --> 19:52.294
Leaving a girl alone at a bar like this?

19:52.295 --> 19:54.296
I've already turned down two drinks

19:54.297 --> 19:56.799
and a weekend in Atlantic City.

19:58.334 --> 20:00.669
Well, sorry, I-I got hung up at work,

20:00.670 --> 20:02.905
and then the metro was slow, and...

20:02.906 --> 20:04.973
Never mind that. You look beautiful.

20:04.974 --> 20:06.308
Uh, what are you drinking,

20:06.309 --> 20:08.544
and how do you like Atlantic City?

20:10.080 --> 20:11.613
Nice recovery.

20:11.614 --> 20:12.948
A-plus.

20:12.949 --> 20:14.917
So, uh, what was... what was happening

20:14.918 --> 20:16.251
at the war college?

20:16.252 --> 20:18.687
Did my... did my dad keep
you after class, or...?

20:18.688 --> 20:21.290
No, just... stuff.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.392
Oh. Well, stuff. Wow.

20:23.393 --> 20:25.927
Sounds important.

20:28.397 --> 20:31.065
Is everything okay?

20:33.602 --> 20:35.037
This...

20:35.038 --> 20:37.506
is-is probably a bad idea.

20:37.507 --> 20:40.075
I was gonna tell you that up front,

20:40.076 --> 20:42.244
but then you were... you are...

20:42.245 --> 20:45.613
funny and... beautiful.

20:46.915 --> 20:50.652
Are you worried about this
because you work with my dad?

20:50.653 --> 20:51.854
Yes.

20:51.855 --> 20:54.089
Okay, look...

20:54.090 --> 20:55.390
Um, here.

20:55.391 --> 20:57.559
Both my parents work for the government,

20:57.560 --> 21:00.696
so if I avoided everyone
that they work with,

21:00.697 --> 21:02.798
I would have to leave town

21:02.799 --> 21:05.200
to date, and...

21:05.201 --> 21:09.004
just, you know, live life in general.

21:09.005 --> 21:12.908
If you're really worried,
I know how to do this.

21:12.909 --> 21:14.243
Date?

21:14.244 --> 21:15.444
Sneak.

21:15.445 --> 21:17.846
I mean, at least until we figure out

21:17.847 --> 21:19.414
what this is gonna be.

21:19.415 --> 21:22.250
And what do you want this to be?

21:22.918 --> 21:25.420
Fun?

21:25.421 --> 21:28.390
I just got my heart broken, so
I'm not really up for anything

21:28.391 --> 21:31.226
that involves family, negotiations

21:31.227 --> 21:34.730
or long discussions about validation

21:34.731 --> 21:36.765
and personal space.

21:36.766 --> 21:39.535
So, you know, if you want
to keep it casual and...

21:39.536 --> 21:41.170
secret,

21:41.171 --> 21:43.238
I'm your girl, Alexander.

21:43.239 --> 21:44.812
Unless you're married or something.

21:44.813 --> 21:47.009
No. Not... No.

21:47.010 --> 21:49.111
- Not married.
- Okay, good.

21:49.112 --> 21:50.779
Feel like we should probably
know things like that

21:50.780 --> 21:52.147
about each other.

21:52.148 --> 21:54.750
Okay, well, ask me anything.

21:54.751 --> 21:56.552
I'm an open book.

21:56.553 --> 21:58.854
Hmm, okay.

21:58.855 --> 22:01.156
Where are you from, originally?

22:01.157 --> 22:03.025
Baltimore.

22:03.026 --> 22:04.326
That was a joke.

22:04.327 --> 22:06.195
Oh.

22:06.196 --> 22:08.430
Okay.

22:08.431 --> 22:10.065
You got me.

22:10.066 --> 22:11.233
Do you want a drink?

22:11.234 --> 22:12.701
Oh, no, I-I don't.

22:12.702 --> 22:14.970
Uh, just club soda.

22:14.971 --> 22:17.506
A Russian who doesn't drink?

22:17.507 --> 22:20.676
Yeah. That's, uh, that's
why they kicked me out.

22:20.677 --> 22:22.277
Really?

22:22.278 --> 22:25.113
No! Damn it.

22:25.114 --> 22:27.783
So you said "I need more time,"

22:27.784 --> 22:29.852
and she just said "Okay"?

22:29.853 --> 22:31.820
Well, first, she warned me again

22:31.821 --> 22:34.189
that I might get grabbed by the FBI.

22:34.190 --> 22:36.124
That's nice of her.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.760
Our budget for bail
money is pretty strained.

22:38.761 --> 22:40.796
Yeah, well, I don't think the FBI

22:40.797 --> 22:42.297
would let me bail out.

22:42.298 --> 22:44.533
All right, pedal to the metal, and, uh,

22:44.534 --> 22:45.901
whatever resources you need.

22:47.003 --> 22:48.936
Thanks, Marc. Good night.

23:05.632 --> 23:07.633
That's, I mean, I guess.

23:07.634 --> 23:08.801
- But I don't know.
- No. Okay.

23:08.802 --> 23:10.169
Breakfast cereal, disgusting.

23:10.170 --> 23:12.037
Sweetened iced tea, disgusting.

23:12.038 --> 23:13.105
- That's fair, that's fair.
- In fact,

23:13.106 --> 23:14.840
everything you call tea here,

23:14.841 --> 23:16.275
- disgusting.
- Mm.

23:16.276 --> 23:18.844
But the worst, the worst:

23:18.845 --> 23:20.913
peanut butter.

23:20.914 --> 23:22.781
Peanut butter?

23:22.782 --> 23:24.850
You don't like peanut butter?

23:24.851 --> 23:27.753
That's like the best American idea

23:27.754 --> 23:31.423
since, um...

23:31.424 --> 23:32.524
jazz.

23:32.525 --> 23:34.093
I... but, probably before jazz.

23:34.094 --> 23:35.296
- That's, that's w...
- You get the idea.

23:35.297 --> 23:36.395
No, that's weird.

23:36.396 --> 23:39.698
Why would you spread peanuts on bread?

23:39.699 --> 23:41.133
It's delicious.

23:42.268 --> 23:44.169
I mean, I don't know what else to say.

23:45.672 --> 23:46.905
Aw...

23:46.906 --> 23:50.442
I should probably go home.

23:50.443 --> 23:52.111
But, um...

23:52.112 --> 23:55.781
You know, maybe next time,
you can... ask me out.

23:55.782 --> 23:58.082
What do you think?

23:59.518 --> 24:01.253
What?

24:01.254 --> 24:03.655
Are you serious?

24:03.656 --> 24:07.659
We just had one of the
all-time greatest first dates.

24:07.660 --> 24:10.062
Didn't we?

24:10.063 --> 24:11.296
We did.

24:11.297 --> 24:13.432
My dad is not gonna fire
you for going out with me.

24:13.433 --> 24:15.267
- It's more complicated than that.
- He's a very rational person.

24:15.268 --> 24:16.402
All I can say

24:16.403 --> 24:18.370
is that it's been a wonderful night,

24:18.371 --> 24:20.105
and I wish...

24:20.106 --> 24:23.207
It's not that complicated.

24:35.422 --> 24:37.688
Okay.

24:38.323 --> 24:40.292
Miguel was always

24:40.293 --> 24:44.063
the first one in the
newsroom and the last one out.

24:44.064 --> 24:47.099
On a few occasions, I
found him asleep on his desk

24:47.100 --> 24:49.468
in the middle of a story.

24:49.469 --> 24:51.870
He was a rare breed, uh,

24:51.871 --> 24:54.306
old-school, relentless

24:54.307 --> 24:58.776
and unwaveringly principled.

25:00.479 --> 25:05.050
The world is a poorer place
without Miguel Briseño.

25:05.051 --> 25:07.352
I've lost count how many reporters

25:07.353 --> 25:10.289
were killed in Mexico this year.

25:10.290 --> 25:11.423
Eleven?

25:11.424 --> 25:13.459
Fourteen.

25:14.627 --> 25:16.929
They guarantee you freedom of the press.

25:16.930 --> 25:19.263
If you kill a reporter
for doing his job...

25:20.332 --> 25:22.367
There hasn't been a single
prosecution, not one.

25:22.368 --> 25:24.103
Miguel is an American citizen.

25:24.104 --> 25:26.772
We're not gonna let his killers go free.

25:26.773 --> 25:28.874
But I need your help to catch them.

25:31.311 --> 25:33.078
You still want his notes?

25:33.079 --> 25:35.213
Anything you're willing to give.

25:36.348 --> 25:39.651
I keep thinking, even now,
Miguel wouldn't have helped you.

25:39.652 --> 25:41.954
Even to solve his own murder,

25:41.955 --> 25:43.355
he would've stuck to his guns

25:43.356 --> 25:45.623
and told you no.

25:47.726 --> 25:50.428
But I am not that principled.

25:52.731 --> 25:55.000
And this is

25:55.001 --> 25:56.235
the second bedroom.

25:56.236 --> 25:58.270
Kind of perfect to start a family.

25:58.271 --> 26:00.038
That's a little cart before the horse.

26:00.039 --> 26:01.507
You'll find someone.

26:01.508 --> 26:03.876
Blake is bisexual, so,
twice the playing field.

26:03.877 --> 26:05.344
Oh, my God.

26:05.345 --> 26:08.447
So, is this a load-bearing wall?

26:08.448 --> 26:09.882
I'll check.

26:09.883 --> 26:12.217
Oh, imagine what you
could do in that kitchen.

26:12.218 --> 26:14.920
I'm sure, but, guys, don't you
think this is a little much?

26:14.921 --> 26:16.555
- Ah.
- It's a modest two-bedroom apartment

26:16.556 --> 26:18.056
for a young professional.

26:18.057 --> 26:19.958
- I knew this was gonna happen.
- What?

26:19.959 --> 26:22.094
Well, you've been an
assistant for too long.

26:22.095 --> 26:23.395
It got up in your head.

26:23.396 --> 26:25.464
You don't think you're
worthy of bigger things.

26:25.465 --> 26:27.099
What is so shameful

26:27.100 --> 26:28.700
about wanting to live within my means?

26:28.701 --> 26:31.103
Well, I'm not just
talking about an apartment.

26:31.104 --> 26:34.173
You used to want to do
things and change things.

26:34.174 --> 26:37.009
You know, some would view
the morning that I spent

26:37.010 --> 26:39.478
preparing a binder on
global water shortages

26:39.479 --> 26:41.580
so we don't have a catastrophe
in sub-Saharan Africa

26:41.581 --> 26:43.215
as doing more to help the world

26:43.216 --> 26:46.151
than balancing a spreadsheet
for some mutual fund.

26:46.152 --> 26:48.453
No one is doubting
the work you're doing.

26:48.454 --> 26:51.523
We just want you to reach
for more for yourself.

26:51.524 --> 26:53.098
I've been talking to
my friend Tim Williams.

26:53.099 --> 26:54.059
Oh, Tim...

26:54.060 --> 26:58.363
His cousin runs a political
consulting firm, and they think

26:58.364 --> 27:02.067
a guy with your experience
would be a great asset for them.

27:02.068 --> 27:04.236
Dad, there is nothing,
nothing more insufferable

27:04.237 --> 27:07.539
than spending all day with
some overpaid policy bro.

27:07.540 --> 27:09.841
You would be doing the
same work you're doing now,

27:09.842 --> 27:12.377
with a chance to advance,
to move up in the world.

27:12.378 --> 27:14.079
We're just asking you to consider it.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.347
That's all we're asking.

27:19.251 --> 27:21.887
Oh.

27:21.888 --> 27:23.855
I... I get it.

27:23.856 --> 27:25.357
You're buying me an apartment

27:25.358 --> 27:27.793
so you can leverage me
into doing what you want.

27:27.794 --> 27:29.895
- Leverage? No one is leveraging you.
- No, we just want...

27:29.896 --> 27:31.821
Guys. Come on, guys.
No, come on. Come on.

27:31.822 --> 27:32.778
- Please.
- I am happy.

27:32.779 --> 27:34.433
Can't you see that I'm happy?

27:34.434 --> 27:36.301
I have a... I have a great life.

27:36.302 --> 27:37.603
I have a great job.

27:37.604 --> 27:39.738
I have a... small studio apartment

27:39.739 --> 27:41.673
that gets way too hot
in the summer, but...

27:41.674 --> 27:43.475
We think that you should...

27:43.476 --> 27:45.843
- Probably want...
- I know what you think.

27:47.980 --> 27:50.616
I know what you think, and I respect it.

27:50.617 --> 27:53.218
I'm sorry you don't respect me.

27:53.219 --> 27:55.087
- No, that's... Look...
- Blake, that's ridiculous.

27:55.088 --> 27:56.255
How could you even...?

27:56.256 --> 27:58.123
But good luck with the
investment, all right?

27:58.124 --> 28:00.192
I love you.

28:00.193 --> 28:02.227
I'll call you later.

28:05.197 --> 28:06.832
- Good news, ma'am.
- No, not good.

28:06.833 --> 28:08.734
Ridiculously amazing. Go ahead.

28:08.735 --> 28:10.469
Miguel's Briseño's notes
are a treasure trove.

28:10.470 --> 28:12.604
You figured out where Macias is?

28:12.605 --> 28:14.039
Oh, no, not at all.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.607
That would've been amazing, too.

28:15.608 --> 28:17.042
However, when Briseño told you

28:17.043 --> 28:19.311
that his next story could change
things... big understatement.

28:19.312 --> 28:20.479
Huge, actually.

28:20.480 --> 28:22.347
He learned that-that
Macias has a friend high up

28:22.348 --> 28:23.515
in the Mexican government.

28:23.516 --> 28:24.983
Like nosebleed high up.

28:24.984 --> 28:27.486
We're figuring deputy
level in the judiciary,

28:27.487 --> 28:28.720
something like that.

28:28.721 --> 28:31.189
Which would explain why
Macias is always one step ahead

28:31.190 --> 28:32.591
- of the Federales.
- Exactly.

28:32.592 --> 28:34.726
Now, we don't have a name
yet, but we do have an alias.

28:34.727 --> 28:36.395
- El A guila.
- The Eagle.

28:36.396 --> 28:38.297
Pretty good, right? As
in "sees everything"?

28:38.298 --> 28:39.831
Anyway, Briseño thought
that he was only days

28:39.832 --> 28:41.166
from tracking down this
guy's actual identity.

28:41.167 --> 28:43.502
So you think we can finish the job?

28:43.503 --> 28:45.203
Yes, ma'am.

28:45.204 --> 28:48.006
Miguel discovered the names of
some offshore dummy corporations

28:48.007 --> 28:49.641
that launder El A guila's money.

28:49.642 --> 28:51.943
We have an army of INR
agents, accountants...

28:51.944 --> 28:53.145
basically the whole department...

28:53.146 --> 28:54.646
sorting out ownership as we speak.

28:54.647 --> 28:56.548
Once we trace the money to a name,

28:56.549 --> 28:58.717
El A guila will be el atrapado.

28:58.718 --> 29:00.352
Encarcelado.

29:00.353 --> 29:02.654
All right.

29:02.655 --> 29:06.190
And DEA just located Macias.

29:10.929 --> 29:13.772
You are aware this is a
remote intelligence office,

29:13.773 --> 29:15.705
and a U.S. Senator
can't just barge in here.

29:15.706 --> 29:17.336
I don't need you scolding me, Professor.

29:17.337 --> 29:18.637
I came here in an unmarked car

29:18.638 --> 29:19.838
with no security.

29:19.839 --> 29:21.273
Why?

29:21.274 --> 29:24.176
My staff heard about these shady
characters posing as reporters,

29:24.177 --> 29:26.411
asking my PAC donors how
they make their money.

29:26.412 --> 29:28.547
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

29:28.548 --> 29:29.715
Oh, of course not.

29:29.716 --> 29:32.184
Why would you admit to
doing oppo research on me

29:32.185 --> 29:33.251
to help your wife's career?

29:33.252 --> 29:34.886
Well, that's a hell of an accusation.

29:34.887 --> 29:36.254
I don't hear you denying.

29:36.255 --> 29:38.890
Of secret things, I am silence.

29:38.891 --> 29:40.425
You always quote the
Bible when you're backed

29:40.426 --> 29:42.461
- into a corner?
- That's the Bhagavad Gita, actually.

29:42.462 --> 29:43.995
Go with smug. Fine.

29:43.996 --> 29:46.498
I cannot discuss classified matters

29:46.499 --> 29:48.033
outside proper channels.

29:48.034 --> 29:50.669
That's not smug. That's the law.

29:50.670 --> 29:52.904
It's also the law that the CIA is barred

29:52.905 --> 29:55.841
from spying on American citizens.

29:55.842 --> 29:58.909
I'm getting the attorney
general into this.

30:04.282 --> 30:08.086
So, we heard all of that.

30:08.087 --> 30:09.688
Are we blown?

30:09.689 --> 30:11.656
Is there something you need to tell me?

30:11.657 --> 30:13.158
Not a chance.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.227
We only used real freelance reporters

30:15.228 --> 30:17.529
who have no idea who
they've been working for.

30:17.530 --> 30:18.997
It's a total firewall.

30:18.998 --> 30:21.466
So you're telling me the senator
just made a really good guess?

30:21.467 --> 30:24.503
Or this is one of many stops
on a guilty conscience tour.

30:24.504 --> 30:26.037
Except he's right.

30:26.038 --> 30:29.007
Well, the drones go online tomorrow.

30:29.008 --> 30:30.742
Then we'll know for sure.

30:30.743 --> 30:33.378
Macias's hideout is in rural Veracruz.

30:33.379 --> 30:34.880
It's a remote home,

30:34.881 --> 30:39.651
but sources say there's a large
bunker underneath the residence.

30:39.652 --> 30:41.586
Cameras are at the entrance,

30:41.587 --> 30:43.588
at least 20 guards in rotation.

30:43.589 --> 30:45.056
If we raid the compound,

30:45.057 --> 30:46.525
you think we can pull him out alive,

30:46.526 --> 30:48.560
Admiral? Yes, I believe we can.

30:48.561 --> 30:51.630
Good. Organize a raid immediately.

30:51.631 --> 30:53.465
President Zaragoza will

30:53.466 --> 30:55.167
want a Mexican Marine presence, as well.

30:55.168 --> 30:56.902
I'm sure he would, but we are not

30:56.903 --> 30:59.237
telling President Zaragoza about this.

30:59.238 --> 31:01.506
Violating their sovereignty.

31:01.507 --> 31:03.208
It's a surgical strike.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.610
We got bin Laden without Pakistan.

31:05.611 --> 31:07.612
Mexico isn't Pakistan, sir.

31:07.613 --> 31:09.948
We're all concerned

31:09.949 --> 31:13.652
about cartel moles inside
Zaragoza's administration.

31:13.653 --> 31:16.688
My team at State is working
at uncovering one as we speak.

31:16.689 --> 31:21.159
But are we really willing
to risk our relationship

31:21.160 --> 31:24.262
with one of our strongest
allies over a cartel leader?

31:24.263 --> 31:26.865
I want Macias in supermax
as much as you do, sir,

31:26.866 --> 31:28.867
but we don't know how
Mexico's gonna react to this.

31:28.868 --> 31:31.069
Mexico wants Macias locked up, too.

31:31.070 --> 31:33.205
If their feathers do get
ruffled, they'll come around.

31:33.206 --> 31:35.255
We're talking about a lot
more than ruffled feathers.

31:35.256 --> 31:37.129
What if they were to pull
out of our trade agreements?

31:37.130 --> 31:39.110
It could send our economy
into a death spiral.

31:39.111 --> 31:41.847
Do you really think that they
would commit economic suicide?

31:41.848 --> 31:44.616
This whole affair has
proven one thing to me:

31:44.617 --> 31:47.586
we can't trust Mexico
when it comes to Macias.

31:47.587 --> 31:49.821
And I refuse to let
that monster get away

31:49.822 --> 31:51.256
while he destroys American lives.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.357
Something needs to be done.

31:52.358 --> 31:54.059
We're raiding his compound.

31:54.060 --> 31:56.060
We're doing it alone.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.495
Got something you need to talk about?

32:12.496 --> 32:13.730
Why do you ask?

32:13.731 --> 32:16.333
Well, there's no milk in that coffee.

32:22.740 --> 32:25.676
Special Forces are moving
into Mexico later today.

32:25.677 --> 32:28.512
Covertly.

32:28.513 --> 32:30.080
Conrad has this...

32:30.081 --> 32:32.349
hawkish streak.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.418
I mean, I get it. The man was a Marine,

32:34.419 --> 32:37.221
head of the CIA.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.990
But you can usually count
on him to put his guns down

32:39.991 --> 32:41.859
and talk when the time is right.

32:41.860 --> 32:43.360
You still think this is about Harrison?

32:43.361 --> 32:44.994
I do.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.699
Well, I can see where he's coming from.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.468
I mean, look at Dmitri.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.270
He was this ramrod
straight military kid.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.505
He comes to the U.S.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.906
and within a matter of months,

32:55.907 --> 32:58.008
he's addicted to oxycodone.

32:58.009 --> 33:00.077
Something needs to be done.

33:00.078 --> 33:04.213
That's exactly what Conrad
said when he ordered the raid.

33:05.415 --> 33:08.552
There isn't a phrase that scares me more

33:08.553 --> 33:10.487
than "something needs to be done."

33:10.488 --> 33:11.889
Why?

33:11.890 --> 33:14.191
It means no one really knows

33:14.192 --> 33:16.692
what to do.

33:21.132 --> 33:22.499
Love you.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.734
Hello.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.569
Hey, we have eyes on all three targets.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.404
Uh, we should have
results in a few hours.

33:27.405 --> 33:30.207
Good. Be sure to report
any suspicious movement.

33:30.208 --> 33:33.143
Okay, I'll keep an eye out.

33:33.144 --> 33:36.280
Should I cancel your
roundtable in Palo Alto?

33:36.281 --> 33:37.548
Yeah, probably.

33:37.549 --> 33:40.083
If we do this raid in Mexico,

33:40.084 --> 33:42.920
I'm gonna need a solid week
to deal with the fallout.

33:42.921 --> 33:44.488
Meetings with Gomez,

33:44.489 --> 33:45.956
Zaragoza.

33:45.957 --> 33:48.325
You know what? Can we take five?

33:48.326 --> 33:51.295
I've never had to actually
plan for a diplomatic crisis.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.897
And it is giving me a massive headache.

33:53.898 --> 33:56.834
Of course.

33:56.835 --> 34:00.437
Oh, hey. How did the,
uh, the open house go?

34:00.438 --> 34:03.307
I decided the place wasn't for me.

34:03.308 --> 34:05.309
Really? Why not?

34:05.310 --> 34:09.079
Turns out it was part of a larger plan

34:09.080 --> 34:11.681
to turn me into a sleazy
political consultant.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.550
They want you to quit State?

34:13.551 --> 34:16.386
It's a much larger conversation,

34:16.387 --> 34:19.523
but, essentially, they want me
to be more than an assistant.

34:19.524 --> 34:22.224
Well, I can understand that.

34:23.627 --> 34:26.063
Blake, you are way too smart
to remain at this level.

34:26.063 --> 34:29.433
Come on, I always imagined

34:29.434 --> 34:31.435
you had a larger goal, right?

34:31.436 --> 34:34.371
Uh, well, I mean,

34:34.371 --> 34:38.375
in-in my first year here, I
kind of wanted to be a policy guy

34:38.376 --> 34:41.143
like Jay or Jay-adjacent.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.846
And now?

34:42.847 --> 34:46.250
I would like to try

34:46.251 --> 34:48.385
something in planning,

34:48.386 --> 34:50.420
more the organizing... I don't know.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.357
- I don't know. I feel like...
- Blake, I'm gonna do you a favor.

34:53.358 --> 34:56.326
In one year I'm gonna fire you.

34:57.528 --> 34:58.662
No, I'm serious.

34:58.663 --> 35:01.431
And you can use that time

35:01.432 --> 35:03.767
to consider what you want to do next.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.135
If it's at State,

35:05.136 --> 35:06.770
I'll do everything I
can to get you that job.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.238
But if it's not at State,

35:08.239 --> 35:11.675
I will write you the most
glowing recommendation

35:11.676 --> 35:15.345
in human history.

35:15.346 --> 35:17.614
Wow. That's very sweet of you, ma'am.

35:17.615 --> 35:22.052
And as momentarily
terrifying as that was,

35:22.053 --> 35:25.889
uh, I-I really appreciate that.

35:25.890 --> 35:27.624
Good.

35:27.625 --> 35:31.895
Do I put you firing
me into your calendar?

35:31.896 --> 35:32.996
Yeah, please do.

35:32.997 --> 35:34.197
- Okay.
- Sorry to barge in again, ma'am.

35:34.198 --> 35:36.500
But we just identified El Aguila.

35:36.501 --> 35:37.668
And...?

35:37.669 --> 35:40.203
Goes even higher than the nosebleeds.

35:40.204 --> 35:42.706
It's the secretary of
foreign affairs, Pedro Gomez.

35:42.707 --> 35:43.941
What?

35:43.942 --> 35:45.175
Macias was right.

35:45.176 --> 35:47.311
He really does run Mexico.

35:59.576 --> 36:01.642
Special Forces have been deployed?

36:01.643 --> 36:03.805
They're in the air, ma'am, ten
minutes from Mexican airspace.

36:03.806 --> 36:05.139
Good.

36:06.908 --> 36:10.045
Sir, you need to cancel this raid.

36:10.046 --> 36:11.446
We've been over this, Bess.

36:11.447 --> 36:13.281
I can't trust Mexico to arrest Macias.

36:13.282 --> 36:16.184
I completely agree, you can't.

36:16.185 --> 36:18.487
This is definitive proof

36:18.488 --> 36:20.355
that the Mexican foreign
secretary, Pedro Gomez,

36:20.356 --> 36:24.192
- is a paid lackey of Sergio Macias.
- What?

36:24.193 --> 36:25.827
Where'd you find all this?

36:25.828 --> 36:28.263
Miguel Briseño's
editor gave me his notes

36:28.264 --> 36:30.999
after he was murdered, and
I would bet everything I own

36:31.000 --> 36:32.834
that Gomez ordered that hit.

36:32.835 --> 36:34.002
Then why stop the raid?

36:34.003 --> 36:37.372
Because we have a real
opportunity here, sir.

36:37.373 --> 36:39.441
If we get Gomez out of power,

36:39.442 --> 36:42.344
and we use our Intel
on Macias as leverage,

36:42.345 --> 36:44.846
we can get an anti-corruption measure

36:44.847 --> 36:46.781
and Macias, with Mexico's help.

36:46.782 --> 36:51.086
Do you know who Briseño's sources were?

36:51.087 --> 36:54.189
Diplomats. High-level
government officials

36:54.190 --> 36:56.424
who were outraged by Gomez

36:56.425 --> 36:58.793
and fighting for a just government.

36:58.794 --> 37:00.395
And with Gomez out of the picture,

37:00.396 --> 37:02.596
they'll have their chance.

37:04.566 --> 37:08.236
If we don't raid now, Macias
could leave the country.

37:08.237 --> 37:12.339
We both know Macias
isn't the real problem.

37:16.177 --> 37:17.312
Admiral Parker,

37:17.313 --> 37:18.380
abort the raid.

37:18.381 --> 37:20.448
Omega Team, abort.

37:20.449 --> 37:23.184
Immediate abort.

37:23.185 --> 37:25.387
Return to base.

37:25.388 --> 37:27.521
Nicely done.

37:43.438 --> 37:46.541
What do you want, McCord?

37:46.542 --> 37:48.777
Beau Carpenter's leaking secrets
to the Russian government.

37:48.778 --> 37:50.812
- What?
- My team has uncovered

37:50.813 --> 37:53.448
an intelligence leak
implicating the Gang of Eight.

37:53.449 --> 37:55.350
Obviously, I couldn't read you in

37:55.351 --> 37:56.851
until we knew who was guilty,

37:56.852 --> 37:59.254
but now we're confident
it's the majority leader.

37:59.255 --> 38:01.923
Beau and Russia, why?

38:01.924 --> 38:05.093
I have no idea, but it
doesn't really matter why.

38:05.094 --> 38:07.562
Once POTUS gives the order,
he'll be under investigation

38:07.563 --> 38:10.131
by a lot of assiduous people.

38:10.132 --> 38:13.134
In the meantime, I need your help.

38:13.135 --> 38:14.302
With what?

38:14.303 --> 38:16.204
Look,

38:16.205 --> 38:17.600
we haven't exactly made it a secret that

38:17.601 --> 38:19.569
we don't like each
other, but I also know

38:19.570 --> 38:21.498
that you love this country
and you would do anything

38:21.499 --> 38:23.233
in your power to keep our secrets.

38:23.234 --> 38:26.636
As chair of the Senate
Intelligence Committee,

38:26.637 --> 38:29.105
you can block information
from reaching Carpenter's desk.

38:29.106 --> 38:32.108
My team is standing by to brief you.

38:32.109 --> 38:34.276
How about it, Senator?

39:04.127 --> 39:07.209
We appreciate you sharing
your intelligence with us.

39:07.210 --> 39:08.577
Frankly, Mr. President,

39:08.578 --> 39:11.413
well, after you agreed to
arrest Gomez, we were happy to.

39:11.414 --> 39:13.916
This is the first significant step

39:13.917 --> 39:16.018
toward eliminating corruption, yes,

39:16.019 --> 39:17.653
but I fear

39:17.654 --> 39:19.688
there will be many more painful steps

39:19.689 --> 39:21.290
before we achieve all our goals.

39:21.291 --> 39:23.692
I think your government
anti-corruption bill

39:23.693 --> 39:25.773
will also have a big impact.

39:25.774 --> 39:27.963
God willing.

39:27.964 --> 39:30.299
And now if you'll excuse
me, I have to get back

39:30.300 --> 39:31.500
to Mexico City.

39:31.501 --> 39:33.168
- Buenosuerte, Mario.
- Presidente, gracias.

39:33.169 --> 39:34.970
Thank you so much.

39:34.971 --> 39:37.705
Mr. President, pleasure. Señora.

39:41.076 --> 39:44.012
Well, it's 11:00 a.m.

39:44.013 --> 39:45.781
and we have put away a drug lord

39:45.782 --> 39:48.016
and a corrupt foreign minister.

39:48.017 --> 39:49.284
That's efficiency.

39:49.285 --> 39:51.653
You should take the rest
of the day off, Russell.

39:51.654 --> 39:53.222
Maybe catch a yoga class.

39:53.223 --> 39:55.357
That's...

39:55.358 --> 39:57.992
the funniest thing
you've ever said to me.

39:59.094 --> 40:00.929
Thank you, Mr. President.

40:00.930 --> 40:03.231
Please, stay a minute, Bess.

40:05.667 --> 40:09.171
I, uh...

40:09.172 --> 40:11.607
I know when I get up a head
of steam about something,

40:11.608 --> 40:15.411
it can be tough to get me off it.

40:15.412 --> 40:17.146
Well,

40:17.147 --> 40:20.282
I mean, it turns out
our goals weren't...

40:20.283 --> 40:22.518
mutually exclusive.

40:22.519 --> 40:23.819
They weren't.

40:23.820 --> 40:27.389
And I'm proud of the work we did today.

40:27.390 --> 40:29.458
But somehow...

40:29.459 --> 40:32.194
it all feels... small.

40:32.195 --> 40:34.730
It's just...

40:34.731 --> 40:37.933
there are so many people in this country

40:37.934 --> 40:39.435
who are addicted and desperate.

40:39.436 --> 40:41.670
No matter what we do,

40:41.671 --> 40:43.739
thousands of them are gonna die

40:43.740 --> 40:46.440
before the opioid crisis gets better.

40:53.549 --> 40:56.118
I've spent...

40:56.119 --> 40:58.654
I can't tell you how many nights,

40:58.655 --> 41:01.590
wide awake... thinking,

41:01.591 --> 41:05.694
I'm going to get a call
from the Secret Service.

41:05.695 --> 41:08.163
They're gonna be in some
town I've never heard of.

41:08.164 --> 41:11.532
And they're going to
tell me my son is dead.

41:13.101 --> 41:15.536
Conrad, I'm so sorry.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.310
But Harrison is, he's in rehab.

41:21.311 --> 41:23.045
He's getting help.

41:23.046 --> 41:25.814
But that demon will
always be inside him.

41:25.815 --> 41:28.450
It can get him anytime.

41:28.451 --> 41:32.453
And that scares me...
more than anything.

42:09.258 --> 42:11.393
Late again?

42:11.394 --> 42:13.428
Is this gonna be your thing?

42:13.429 --> 42:16.865
- Uh, maybe.
- Mmm.
