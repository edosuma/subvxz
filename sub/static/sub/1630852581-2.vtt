WEBVTT

00:11.720 --> 00:13.960
And a bag of scraps for
the cat, please, Mr Fredericks.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.280
Certainly, Miss Nellins.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.880
If she takes much longer, that lamb
will've turned into mutton.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.040
See you tomorrow.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.000
Mrs McCarthy.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.840
Haven't seen you around
Ruby's Cafe Americano yet?

00:29.840 --> 00:32.560
You must come and try one
of my "hot dogs".

00:32.560 --> 00:36.280
You won't catch me eating a dog,
hot or otherwise.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.280
Even during the war,
we never had to sink that low.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.800
Mrs McCarthy.
And what'll it be today?

00:44.800 --> 00:48.000
Pork chops. Fresh,
if you wouldn't mind.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.360
I'm afraid last week's were almost
on the turn.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.320
Good day, Mr Penmark.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.800
And you know what day it is?

00:57.800 --> 01:01.000
Yes. About the rent.
I just need to go to the bank.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.600
I'll have that for you by
closing time.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.360
Make sure you do.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.400
Mrs McCarthy.
See you at Mass tomorrow.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.440
Thank you.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.240
Help...help!

01:15.240 --> 01:16.840
The Presbytery's on fire.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.920
Could everybody stay back,
please?

01:24.920 --> 01:27.440
For your own safety's sake,
please. Father Brown is in there!

01:27.440 --> 01:30.120
Mrs McCarthy, Don't. Father!
Mrs McCarthy, please.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.200
Father.

01:34.840 --> 01:37.200
Father?! Father Brown.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.520
Hello?

01:38.520 --> 01:41.200
Surprise.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.000
Happy birthday, Mrs McCarthy.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.360
SHE COUGHS

02:17.120 --> 02:19.440
So I put the cake in the oven,

02:19.440 --> 02:21.440
nipped down to the Red Lion for
a swift half,

02:21.440 --> 02:22.760
completely lost track of time.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.320
Well, at least one
of us hasn't changed, Sid.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.760
Yeah. When did you become a
fireman? Last time I saw you,

02:28.760 --> 02:31.240
you were lugging
a wheelbarrow around.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.560
Finished my training
a couple of months back, yeah.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.640
Uniform helps with the ladies?

02:35.640 --> 02:36.920
I wish.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.840
The Landlady's got a strict "no
guests" rule.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.040
Especially female ones.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.080
This is delicious, sir.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.880
You should try some.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.000
No thank you, Sergeant.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.200
Since my last medical,
Mrs Mallory's got me on

02:50.200 --> 02:55.400
a strict diet.
She has spies everywhere.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.800
Happy birthday, Mrs McCarthy.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.040
Oh, Miss Nellins.
What a pleasant surprise.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.760
Miss Nellins offered to help
with the catering.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.800
No dogs were harmed.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.080
Now your move from America
is permanent,

03:08.080 --> 03:10.600
will we be seeing you at Mass again?

03:10.600 --> 03:14.600
I always remember you and your
sister belting out the hymns.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.800
Not really my cup
of tea nowadays, Father. Sorry.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.040
Told you. It's the uniform.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.000
No shame. Just like her sister.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.760
Mrs Langdon.

03:32.760 --> 03:37.040
Frances Penmark was a sweet,
God-fearing young woman.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.320
On the surface.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.640
Before her accident,

03:42.640 --> 03:46.360
she was carrying on behind
Walter Penmark's back.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.040
Oh, that's poppycock.

03:48.040 --> 03:53.120
Frances barely left the house except
to go to church or the shops.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.160
You're not suggesting it was that
dreadful butcher?

03:56.160 --> 03:58.440
FATHER BROWN CLEARS HIS THROAT

03:58.440 --> 04:01.800
Either way, I'm not one to gossip.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.160
Especially as poor Frances is not
there to defend herself.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.240
In the current climate,
I think you'll find...

04:14.240 --> 04:18.680
My properties are not for sale,
Mr Belcroft.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.960
You cannot stop progress,
Mr Penmark.

04:21.960 --> 04:25.840
No. But I can stop you.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.320
I'll show myself out.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.240
Good morning.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.240
Good morning,
Father.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.480
Morning. Father. Hello.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.480
Good morning. Morning.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.360
Sorry I'm late.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.000
Mr Belcroft?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.960
I understood that you worshipped at
St John's in Hambleston?

05:29.960 --> 05:33.480
I was raised an Anglican, Father,
but I keep an open mind.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.560
I wish to get to know
Kembleford better.

05:35.560 --> 05:39.600
One must understand a place in order
to improve it, don't you think?

05:41.680 --> 05:44.840
I hear he's been buying up property
all over Kembleford.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.640
Heaven only knows what for.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.680
Father.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.480
I have a case for you.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.960
A case?

05:52.960 --> 05:55.320
Seen you doing your investigating.

05:55.320 --> 05:59.000
Someone has written
the word "Grando" on my lawn.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.800
In paint.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.080
And there's a dagger
with wings on it.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.720
Grando? Sounds like some comic
book character.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.960
Probably just mischievous children.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.920
Well, I want the little
guttersnipe caught.

06:11.920 --> 06:16.200
Well, I'm afraid, Mrs Langdon,
just now it is time for Mass.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.800
We'll talk later.

06:20.600 --> 06:27.040
ORGAN PLAYS

06:31.840 --> 06:37.080
# All ye who seek a comfort sure

06:37.080 --> 06:41.920
# In trouble and distress

06:41.920 --> 06:47.960
# Whatever sorrow vex the mind

06:47.960 --> 06:54.040
# Or guilt the soul compress. #

06:55.720 --> 06:59.160
I'll see you at choir practice. I'll
see you later.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.160
Pub? And where have you been,
Sidney Carter?

07:04.160 --> 07:05.680
Overslept. Sorry.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.960
Anyone seen Walter Penmark?

07:07.960 --> 07:09.720
No. Not since yesterday.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.360
I can't remember
the last time he missed Mass.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.320
Perhaps I should visit?

07:15.320 --> 07:18.200
I don't like to think
of him alone in that big house.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.680
Walter Penmark likes to be alone.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.840
Apparently he barely spoke
a single word

07:22.840 --> 07:25.160
to his poor wife,
may-she-rest-in-peace.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.160
Even so...
In any case,

07:27.160 --> 07:29.600
there's a far more urgent matter
to attend to.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.440
Someone has been vandalising
church property.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.360
Probably the same little miscreants
who painted

07:36.360 --> 07:38.400
Peggy Langdon's back garden.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.520
"Fames"?

07:40.520 --> 07:42.360
I know that look.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.920
Yeah, so, do I? It means no pub.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.920
The door and window were locked from
the inside.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.720
There's no open fireplace.
No sign of electrical fault.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.280
No smoking paraphernalia.
There's not even a box of matches.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.680
So he just sat at his desk
and burst into flames?

08:13.680 --> 08:16.120
The fire investigator's on his way
down now.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.840
Might be able to tell us more.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.520
KNOCK AT DOOR

08:20.520 --> 08:22.480
Padre. Let me guess,
you saw the smoke

08:22.480 --> 08:26.280
and thought they were announcing
the next Pope?

08:26.280 --> 08:28.560
Walter Penmark was
a member of my flock.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.360
Can't you give us five minutes?

08:30.360 --> 08:32.600
He's not going anywhere.

08:33.560 --> 08:36.320
Can anyone else smell Scotch?

08:36.320 --> 08:41.520
Well, Mr Penmark was fond of a
drink, even at this early hour.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.160
Have you considered
"spontaneous combustion"?

08:45.160 --> 08:47.400
I read about it in
Modern Wonder magazine.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.920
It's a rare and natural phenomenon.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.800
Some people have been known
to suddenly burst into flames.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.480
Feel free to demonstrate.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.440
If you don't mind.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.200
What the flaming Nora does
"Ignis" mean?

09:07.640 --> 09:09.560
It means it's murder.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.520
Are you saying the drawing in the
hymnal is some kind of threat to me?

09:18.520 --> 09:22.080
Ecclesiasticus 39:35.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.400
Ignis, grando, fames, et mors,

09:25.400 --> 09:28.480
omnia haec ad vindictam creata sunt.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.840
My Latin's a little rusty.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.600
"Ignis" - fire.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.920
"Grando" - hail.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.400
"Fames" - famine.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.280
"Mors" - death.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.120
All of these were created
for vengeance.

09:41.120 --> 09:45.840
We think the winged dagger
symbolises an "avenging angel".

09:45.840 --> 09:48.360
And they've already claimed their
first victim.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.960
An avenging angel? Well, that would
explain how they set fire

09:50.960 --> 09:53.160
to someone inside a locked room.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.120
We need a list of anyone in
Kembleford

09:56.120 --> 09:58.480
that you may have upset or offended.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.400
I've never offended anyone in
my life.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.320
Nonetheless, Mrs McCarthy,

10:03.320 --> 10:06.320
if there's anybody at all that
you can think of.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.560
Yeah. Just in case.

10:08.560 --> 10:13.120
Well, I suppose Mrs French
from the haberdashery.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.800
But that was just a misunderstanding
with the Sewing Circle.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.080
It's a start.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.240
And Mr Begley,

10:20.240 --> 10:22.760
the music teacher from
the primary school.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.320
Mr Begley. Right.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.400
Well, it was hardly my fault that he
was tone-deaf.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.520
Oh, and there was that
new veterinarian,

10:30.520 --> 10:32.160
Mrs Barrington.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.080
I had to ask her to leave the choir.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.600
And Miss Cleary from
the Salvation Army.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.120
Well, she's just
a difficult woman.

10:43.480 --> 10:47.000
Should've asked her to list
the people she hasn't offended.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.920
Where do we start, Inspector?

10:48.920 --> 10:51.360
Peggy Langdon.
We'll warn her about the threat

10:51.360 --> 10:55.240
and see if any of her nemeses
overlap with Mrs McCarthy's.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.520
Mrs McCarthy?

10:57.520 --> 10:59.000
What?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.880
We think you should stay at
the Presbytery for

11:00.880 --> 11:03.640
the moment,
so we can keep an eye on you.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.240
Yeah, until this thing is sorted,

11:05.240 --> 11:07.680
you consider me your own
personal bodyguard.

11:07.680 --> 11:11.360
Oh, Sidney. Thank you.
You're both very kind.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.960
Father?
Argh.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.040
Something the matter?
You tell me, son.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.480
Sid. How can we help, Mr Belcroft?

11:19.480 --> 11:21.920
I heard the terrible news about
Mr Penmark.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.520
Please do pass on my condolences
to any surviving family members.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.320
I don't think there are any,

11:27.320 --> 11:30.560
apart from his sister-in-law,
Miss Nellins.

11:30.560 --> 11:35.400
Mr Penmark's wife died before they
were blessed with children.

11:35.400 --> 11:40.600
Such a pity. I must be getting on.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.240
What's his game?

11:42.240 --> 11:45.400
He's surely not after
Mr Penmark's properties?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.240
The man's body's barely cold.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.400
Perhaps we should see who else stood

11:50.400 --> 11:52.960
to gain from Walter
Penmark's death?

11:52.960 --> 11:55.560
And go to the shops.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.720
Well, you said "Fames" means famine.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.800
And if someone's trying
to starve me to death,

12:00.800 --> 12:02.720
well, they'll have another thing
coming.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.400
Because I am going to bake like I
have never baked before.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.800
Things are looking up.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.400
Did you hear what we said,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.720
Mrs Langdon?
Someone's threatening to.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.880
What could anyone possibly have
against me?

12:19.880 --> 12:23.560
Mrs Langdon. Just because somebody
barbecued that joyless

12:23.560 --> 12:26.880
snake of a man
doesn't mean I'm in danger.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.920
The message was probably meant
for one of my guests.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.280
Anyone in mind?

12:32.280 --> 12:34.600
We had someone stay last
week.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.680
Foreign, he was.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.480
Definite shiftiness about
the eyes. Probably meant for him.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.840
Do you have a name?

12:41.840 --> 12:47.440
I'd have to look it up.
It was something foreign.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.680
I think we're done.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.800
What about my garden?

12:51.800 --> 12:55.000
We will do our best to apprehend
the culprit, Mrs Langdon.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
Too right. Hail, indeed.
You can kill a person with fire,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.920
yes, but hail in
the middle of summer?

13:04.920 --> 13:07.000
She does have a point, sir.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.680
You've let your imagination get
the better of you, Inspector.

13:10.680 --> 13:14.320
Someone's imagination has got
the better of me.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.240
I should never have listened
to Father Brown.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.400
Thank you, Miss Nellins.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.960
Ruby, please.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.760
After being in the States for
so long,

13:31.760 --> 13:33.960
I can't get used
to all of this formality.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.640
Ruby, then. How's business?

13:36.640 --> 13:39.560
Picking up. Got a few regulars now.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.560
I like the place. It's new,
different.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.440
If you ever decide to sell.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.640
Talking of which,
I was wondering who will inherit

13:50.640 --> 13:54.560
your late brother-in-law's
properties?

13:54.560 --> 13:56.800
I wouldn't know, I'm afraid.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.200
If you'll excuse me.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.800
You sure you won't have anything
to eat, Mrs McCarthy?

14:03.800 --> 14:06.600
Well, if I could decipher this menu.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.240
"Over Easy"?
What's that supposed to mean?

14:09.240 --> 14:11.320
No, no,
I'll be quite content with

14:11.320 --> 14:15.080
a bowl of soup when I get home,
thank you.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.480
Enjoy.
Oh, I am.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.600
My condolences, by the way.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.840
Thanks, but I hardly knew Walter.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.480
He and my sister married after
I moved away.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.080
What made you decide
to come back to Kembleford?

14:27.080 --> 14:29.160
I came back for Frances' funeral.

14:29.160 --> 14:34.440
Seeing the place again, I guess
Kembleford still felt like home.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.240
Do they know how the fire started?

14:36.240 --> 14:37.280
Not yet.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.800
But someone sent Walter Penmark
a note.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.480
It was a threat.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.880
Would you know anyone who?

14:44.880 --> 14:46.520
No.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.600
I mean, I know Walter raised the
rents

14:48.600 --> 14:51.200
of some of his tenants recently.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.960
Mr Fredericks wasn't
so happy about it.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.960
But I can't imagine that
anything would...

14:54.960 --> 14:57.760
Where is she? Where is she?

14:57.760 --> 15:01.040
Can you spare any change?

15:01.040 --> 15:02.560
The old dears have wiped me out.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.040
Of course. How much do you need?

15:04.040 --> 15:08.000
I'm so sorry. I just...
I am going home.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.280
COIN CLINKS

15:41.800 --> 15:47.200
Subvenite, Sancti Dei, occurrite,
Angeli Domini...

15:47.200 --> 15:48.360
Thank you, Mrs Cottrell.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.920
We'll give you a knock if we have
any further questions.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.160
What's happened? Is that...?

15:53.160 --> 15:54.960
Your landlady. Blow to the head.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.760
Probably killed instantly.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.960
Mind telling me your whereabouts
this evening?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.800
I was at the station,
on duty.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.920
Then Ruby's Cafe for a bite
to eat.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.640
Inspector. Found something, sir.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.840
Please say it's
a signed confession.

16:08.840 --> 16:12.920
Not exactly, sir.
It was on the kitchen table.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.400
Richard Belcroft?

16:14.400 --> 16:16.720
He came to see Mrs
Langdon yesterday.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.920
He wanted to buy the guesthouse.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.720
She told him where to go.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.000
Check Mr Belcroft's whereabouts
for this evening.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.080
As for you,
this is a crime scene, so scram.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.680
Only footprints in
the flower-bed belong to the victim.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.800
No sign of a weapon.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.520
And yet somehow she has had her
skull caved in.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.440
Like she was struck by
a deadly blow from on high, sir.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.080
Ice.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.520
Ice?

16:47.520 --> 16:50.800
Well, look. The lawn is dry except
for a wet patch

16:50.800 --> 16:53.120
by the victim's head.

16:53.120 --> 16:57.880
She was struck on the head by a
large block of ice from above.

16:57.880 --> 17:01.240
Like a giant hailstone.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.400
Here we go again.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.840
It's probably thrown from
the roof, or a window.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.560
And the coin in her hand was

17:08.560 --> 17:10.640
a lure to get her into
the right position.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.560
Why bother when you could simply
walk up

17:12.560 --> 17:13.920
and smack her over
the head?

17:13.920 --> 17:16.720
To make it appear like
an unsolvable crime.

17:16.720 --> 17:21.040
That could only be committed by
an avenging angel.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.680
Like a man burnt to death in
a locked room.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.120
We don't even know that was murder.

17:27.120 --> 17:30.000
Until we get the fire report
and postmortem.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.280
Ignis is fire. Grando is
hail.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.880
Murders, trust me.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.360
The only problem is,

17:40.360 --> 17:45.040
where did someone get a large block
of ice in Kembleford

17:45.040 --> 17:46.600
on a hot summer's day?

17:57.360 --> 17:59.840
Wakey-wakey, sleepyhead.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.360
Cabbages.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.320
You must've dozed off.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.120
I've brought you a cup of tea.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.560
You should've woken me.
I'm supposed to be on guard.

18:07.560 --> 18:11.200
Well, I'm still alive,
no thanks to you.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.600
Poor Peggy Langdon.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.360
An acquired taste,
no doubt,

18:15.360 --> 18:19.240
but she didn't deserve what happened
to her.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.720
Argh!
Argh!

18:35.720 --> 18:38.160
What are you sneaking around for?

18:38.160 --> 18:40.640
I thought you might still
be asleep.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.000
Ah, not me. Wide awake,
reporting for duty.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.960
Good. I've been doing some research.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.520
There are three
deep freeze making machines

18:49.520 --> 18:52.920
in Kembleford capable of making a
large block of ice.

18:52.920 --> 18:56.720
One in Mr Fredericks' shop,
one in Ruby's Cafe,

18:56.720 --> 19:00.160
and one in the private residence
of Mr Richard Belcroft.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.680
Which of those three have you
cheesed off?

19:02.680 --> 19:04.440
None of them.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.040
If you have,

19:06.040 --> 19:09.440
now would be a very good time
to make amends.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.720
The chops fresh enough for you,
Mrs McCarthy?

19:20.720 --> 19:22.720
Very satisfactory, thank you.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.480
I can vouch for that. Delicious.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.720
What's on the menu today?

19:26.720 --> 19:28.280
An apology.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.760
Is that so? And for what exactly?

19:31.760 --> 19:33.120
That letter to the council?

19:33.120 --> 19:36.440
Suggesting you had
an infestation of rodents?

19:36.440 --> 19:38.920
That was me. And I'm very sorry.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.960
I knew it. You see,

19:40.960 --> 19:42.840
I've never had a single rat in
this shop.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.840
In Mrs M's defence, she did have
several people talk about rats...

19:45.840 --> 19:47.960
But did you ever see one
for yourself?

19:47.960 --> 19:49.600
Well, not exactly.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.120
I was already struggling
with my rent.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.840
And now half my best customers are
staying away from my shop.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.280
And for that Mrs McCarthy is
truly sorry.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.280
Very much so.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.040
I know why you're apologising.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.800
You think it was me, don't you?

20:05.800 --> 20:10.400
Excuse me? I was in church with
you when Mr Penmark got roasted.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.680
As for Mrs Langdon,
I was here mopping my floor

20:13.680 --> 20:16.240
with half of Kembleford walking past
my window.

20:16.240 --> 20:20.160
Well, perhaps if you sliced your
bacon to a reasonable width

20:20.160 --> 20:24.640
and refrained from bulking out your
sausages with breadcrumbs...

20:24.640 --> 20:26.120
How dare you?

20:26.120 --> 20:27.880
Why don't we all calm down?

20:27.880 --> 20:29.480
You're barred.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.880
I beg your pardon?
You get out my shop. You're barred.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.480
Perhaps...
OUT.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.200
I think we should do as he says.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.080
You organised a petition?

20:50.080 --> 20:52.160
Well, I was concerned that your
cafe

20:52.160 --> 20:55.800
might damage
Kembleford's traditional character.

20:55.800 --> 21:00.640
But now, of course, I realise that
it's an invaluable asset

21:00.640 --> 21:02.640
and I'm very sorry.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.960
Apology accepted.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.240
After all, my sister often wrote
to me saying

21:07.240 --> 21:09.560
how kind you were to her.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.040
She said that you were always there
to help out

21:12.040 --> 21:13.960
or give a word of advice.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.920
I was very fond of Frances.

21:15.920 --> 21:19.200
So, now that we've made up,

21:19.200 --> 21:22.520
you must try one of my hot dogs.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.200
Oh, I'm not sure that I...

21:24.200 --> 21:25.800
I insist.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.520
I've got to get me one of those.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.840
If it helps,
the Queen Mother has tried one.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.640
At a picnic with Eleanor Roosevelt.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.280
Well, can I at least have
a knife and fork?

21:45.280 --> 21:47.600
When in Rome, Mrs McCarthy.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.040
Was the cafe open
yesterday night?

22:02.040 --> 22:03.840
Until eight, yes.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.880
Many customers?

22:05.880 --> 22:08.800
Not really.
Some kids in for ice cream.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.280
And a couple from the campsite up
the road. Why do you ask?

22:12.280 --> 22:16.360
I was wondering if anyone else had
access to your deep freeze?

22:16.360 --> 22:19.840
Just me. It's in the storeroom.
I have the only key.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.040
With hindsight,

22:34.040 --> 22:37.240
being starved to death might
have been preferable.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.800
Speak for yourself.
I could have gone again.

22:41.280 --> 22:44.680
Ah, Mrs McCarthy.
The lab tests are back.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.360
Mr Penmark was drugged.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.840
Barbiturates, probably.

22:48.840 --> 22:52.600
No sign of smoke inhalation, though,
so likely he died before the fire.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.800
I just wanted you to know,
cos it means he wasn't...

22:55.800 --> 22:58.320
Well, you know...

22:58.320 --> 22:59.440
Burned alive?

22:59.440 --> 23:01.040
Exactly.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.600
Some consolation.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.040
Oh, great.

23:05.040 --> 23:08.520
So there's a chance
the murderer might drug me first.

23:08.520 --> 23:12.040
And we still have no idea who's
behind all this.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.320
Not true.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.920
Gideon Fredericks and Ruby Nellins
might have had the means to make ice

23:16.920 --> 23:20.040
but both of them had an alibi
for Peggy Langdon's murder.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.240
So that just leaves Mr Belcroft.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.080
Who, it seems,

23:24.080 --> 23:27.720
was trying to purchase properties
from both of the victims.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.560
Properties they were not keen
to sell.

23:30.560 --> 23:33.080
That still doesn't explain why he'd
want to kill me.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.560
I barely know the man.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.960
Except...

23:39.400 --> 23:41.440
Peggy Langdon said that
Frances

23:41.440 --> 23:44.920
was having an affair before she
died.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.920
What if the man she was seeing was
Richard Belcroft?

23:47.920 --> 23:51.680
Well, I don't see how that connects
to you.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.400
A few weeks before her death,
Frances came to see me.

23:55.400 --> 24:01.840
She wanted to know if it was always
a sin to end a marriage.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.120
What was your response?

24:04.120 --> 24:08.320
Well, I explained that marriage is
very often difficult

24:08.320 --> 24:10.960
and that she'd made
a commitment before God.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.320
And that she should
try to make it work.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.560
What if she ended her relationship
with Mr Belcroft

24:17.560 --> 24:21.160
because of my advice? And now...

24:21.160 --> 24:25.200
Now he's hellbent on wreaking
his revenge.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.760
Sid, go back to the Presbytery
with Mrs McCarthy

24:27.760 --> 24:29.040
and look after her.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.680
I'm going to should speak
with Richard Belcroft alone.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.840
Are you sure that's a good idea?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.360
I know a safe place.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.640
Mr Belcroft.
Thank you for your punctuality.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.520
Your message said it was important.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.360
A matter of death or life.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.480
Isn't that a matter for the police?

24:56.480 --> 24:57.960
Humour me.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.680
The properties you are buying in
Kembleford,

25:01.680 --> 25:03.240
what do you want them for?

25:03.240 --> 25:06.600
Holiday cottages, guest-houses.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.680
Local industry is dying

25:08.680 --> 25:10.560
and tourism is the future.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.760
Walter Penmark and Peggy Langdon

25:12.760 --> 25:15.480
stood in
the way of your business plans.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.360
And Mrs McCarthy, as it turns out,

25:18.360 --> 25:22.560
inadvertently got in
the way of your amorous intentions.

25:22.560 --> 25:27.560
I can assure you I have no amorous
intentions towards Mrs McCarthy.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.800
Frances Penmark?

25:29.800 --> 25:33.160
What led you to the misguided
opinion that I might be involved?

25:33.160 --> 25:34.880
Your deep freeze.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.720
It's an extravagance, I know,

25:36.720 --> 25:39.280
but part of my quest
to drag Kembleford

25:39.280 --> 25:41.000
into the modern world.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.080
Or it would be if the blasted thing
wasn't on the blink.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.240
It's not working?

25:45.240 --> 25:46.880
Keeps cutting out.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.160
Sent it away to be repaired
last week. Weighs a tonne,

25:49.160 --> 25:52.720
I had to pay my old gardener
to pick it up in his van.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.440
You see, Father,

25:54.440 --> 25:57.000
I don't have to murder people
to solve my problems.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.800
I have money for that.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.360
Why are they doing this to me?

26:08.360 --> 26:12.280
We'll get to the bottom of this.
This was left on the doorstep.

26:12.280 --> 26:15.720
Looks like a pig's tongue.
With artistic embellishment.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.240
I've had enough of this.

26:18.240 --> 26:22.280
Father, you'd better go after him.
No, I'll be fine.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.720
Lock the door after me.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.480
I will.

26:29.600 --> 26:33.400
Sid...

26:33.400 --> 26:35.760
Sid. Where are you going?

26:35.760 --> 26:38.600
To end this.
But we don't know who sent it.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.080
Who else has pig tongues
lying around?

26:41.080 --> 26:43.840
And he's stopped her buying food in
his shop.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.520
Famine, remember?

26:45.520 --> 26:47.280
We need to talk about this.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.120
I've done talking.

26:49.120 --> 26:52.680
Look, me and Mrs M,
we haven't always seen eye-to-eye.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.120
But whenever I've needed a hot meal,
a nice cup of tea,

26:55.120 --> 26:57.240
a place to stay, whenever
I have needed someone

26:57.240 --> 26:59.360
to tell me I am being an idiot,

26:59.360 --> 27:01.120
she was there.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.480
So if someone wants to mess
with Mrs M,

27:03.480 --> 27:05.240
they're gonna have to deal with me.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.800
What're you playing at?

27:12.800 --> 27:15.760
Excuse me?
This tongue.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.640
You sent that to Mrs McCarthy,
didn't you?

27:17.640 --> 27:20.520
Why would I send her free meat when
she's barred from my shop?

27:20.520 --> 27:23.640
Don't get clever with me, or I'll
shove that tongue down your throat.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.560
That came out wrong.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.800
Sid. Don't pick a fight with
a man holding a meat cleaver.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.680
You should listen to
the good Father.

27:30.680 --> 27:33.040
You killed them, didn't you?
Not guilty.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.200
Why should I believe you?

27:34.200 --> 27:36.920
Peggy Langdon has been
a customer of mine for years.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.120
As for Mr Penmark,

27:38.120 --> 27:40.240
I won't pretend I'll shed
a tear over him.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.920
He was a cruel man.

27:41.920 --> 27:45.440
And I was not surprised when I heard
about his wife's "accident".

27:45.440 --> 27:47.360
How do you mean, Mr Fredericks?

27:47.360 --> 27:49.760
I know the mechanic who pulled that
poor woman's car

27:49.760 --> 27:52.120
out the river at Fernley Bridge.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.720
It was a dry day,
no skid marks,

27:54.720 --> 27:56.760
and the brakes were working fine.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.760
If she went over the side,

27:58.760 --> 28:01.480
it's because she meant to.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.720
Here to quote more Latin at
me, Padre?

28:09.720 --> 28:12.400
As a matter of fact,
I came to give you this.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.720
Very generous but next time

28:18.720 --> 28:20.720
a bottle of single malt
would suffice.

28:20.720 --> 28:25.240
It was left at the Presbytery,
addressed to Mrs McCarthy.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.240
I see. Log that, will you?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.680
And make sure you wrap it in
something or it'll stink out

28:30.680 --> 28:34.040
the evidence room.
Yes, sir.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.760
We'll be in touch if there's any
more news.

28:41.600 --> 28:46.240
Hope you weren't divulging details
of an ongoing investigation?

28:46.240 --> 28:48.080
Course not, sir.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.880
Here you go.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.240
Don't worry. It'll be our secret.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.080
Been thinking...

29:07.080 --> 29:09.960
Seeing as how the culprit can pass
through locked doors,

29:09.960 --> 29:12.080
leave no footprints
and what-have-you,

29:12.080 --> 29:15.680
you don't think that Frances Penmark
has come back from beyond the grave

29:15.680 --> 29:18.160
to avenge herself on those that
wronged her?

29:18.160 --> 29:19.920
BOTH: No.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.880
Anything?

29:21.880 --> 29:24.040
On the day Frances Penmark died

29:24.040 --> 29:27.120
Walter Penmark was away on business.

29:27.120 --> 29:30.280
With her sister already in
the United States,

29:30.280 --> 29:33.600
the body was identified by their
gardener.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.640
Only there's no name.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.560
Well, maybe have a word with
the neighbours,

29:37.560 --> 29:39.440
see if they knew who it was?

29:39.440 --> 29:41.040
No need.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.480
KNOCK ON DOOR

30:14.200 --> 30:16.000
Father.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Mrs Langdon's sister's coming up
from Devon

30:19.000 --> 30:22.680
to sort the place.
I said I'd make a start.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.760
You worked for Mr and Mrs Penmark,
didn't you?

30:29.840 --> 30:32.640
Did a bit of gardening for them,
if that's what you mean?

30:34.760 --> 30:39.000
That's how you knew about
Walter Penmark's drinking.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.480
He was a proud man.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.520
He worked hard to keep that a
secret.

30:46.120 --> 30:51.280
You handed in your notice
when Frances Penmark died.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.880
It must have been difficult
for you to go back there.

30:56.800 --> 31:00.680
I left to train to be a fireman,
Father. Serve my community.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.680
How long were you
and Mrs Penmark in love?

31:12.600 --> 31:16.680
She was trapped in
an unhappy marriage.

31:20.440 --> 31:23.520
Her husband locked himself in
his study,

31:23.520 --> 31:26.160
working long hours.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.880
And there were you,
just outside her window.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.680
Your landlady cottoned on,
didn't she?

31:39.040 --> 31:43.160
And when Frances discovered
Mrs Langdon was spreading rumours

31:43.160 --> 31:45.440
of her infidelity,

31:45.440 --> 31:48.120
she went to an old friend
for advice.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.080
Mrs McCarthy told her to stay
with her husband,

31:52.080 --> 31:53.120
which she did.

31:55.080 --> 31:59.680
But she couldn't crush
the guilt or the loneliness.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.880
The police report was inconclusive

32:05.880 --> 32:09.120
but you must have known
it was suicide.

32:09.120 --> 32:14.240
You don't know what you're saying.
I was their gardener, that's all.

32:14.240 --> 32:20.240
You wanted revenge on
the husband who made her miserable,

32:20.240 --> 32:23.520
on the gossip who forced her into
a corner,

32:23.520 --> 32:28.680
and on the friend who convinced her
to turn her back on you.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.600
She was like the sunlight on
a Spring morning.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.280
And she loved me, I know she did.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.520
We could've been happy, Father.

32:41.520 --> 32:45.120
So you delivered the note
to Walter Penmark.

32:45.120 --> 32:51.520
And you went back later,
drugged him and set him on fire.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.840
The first on the scene,

32:54.840 --> 32:58.680
it was easy for you to slip
the key back in the lock on

32:58.680 --> 33:01.200
the inside of the door.

33:03.400 --> 33:07.720
Then you killed Peggy Langdon.

33:07.720 --> 33:12.000
The block of ice from
Richard Belcroft's deep freeze.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.720
That freezer went straight
to the workshop.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.640
And as for Mr Penmark,
well, check the fire report.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.120
Alcohol was an accelerant.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.680
He would've gone up in a flash.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.360
But I was in church for a whole hour

33:30.360 --> 33:32.600
before anyone even saw a wisp of
smoke.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.880
You had an accomplice.

33:42.480 --> 33:46.080
Someone who had
a deep freeze of their own.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.960
Someone who could give you
an alibi

33:47.960 --> 33:50.760
for the time of Peggy Langdon's
death.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.720
Who loved Frances Penmark as much
as you.

33:55.720 --> 34:00.120
Someone who travelled halfway around
the world to get revenge.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.520
May I?

34:04.520 --> 34:08.840
Oh, please.
Now help yourself to my scones.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.120
As many as you like.

34:10.120 --> 34:13.000
I'm afraid I got
a bit carried away this morning.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.840
You do seem to have rather a lot.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.440
I actually came to offering my
catering services

34:18.440 --> 34:21.320
at the next church fete.
Oh, really?

34:21.320 --> 34:24.800
I didn't think you were exactly fond
of the church.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.800
I'm fond of Kembleford.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.720
And I spent a lot of time in
the church as a girl.

34:29.720 --> 34:34.960
Sunday school.
Learning right from wrong.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.360
Oh? I mustn't have rinsed

34:37.360 --> 34:40.280
the pot out properly,
it tastes funny...

34:41.760 --> 34:45.000
It was all nonsense,
of course,

34:45.000 --> 34:46.920
but Frances swallowed every word
of it.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.120
Miss Nellins...

34:48.120 --> 34:52.920
So when a stupid old woman told her
that she would rot in hell

34:52.920 --> 34:59.400
unless she stayed with her
cold-hearted, abusive husband,

34:59.400 --> 35:00.920
Frances believed her.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.760
I had no idea what she was
going through.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.240
Well, let me inform you.

35:06.240 --> 35:09.400
Because she told me in her letters.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.880
She feared for her life.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.920
Every. Single. Day.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.040
Stupid woman.

35:30.040 --> 35:33.360
You're making it worse. Leave it.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.880
Get out!

35:36.280 --> 35:37.800
Please,

35:39.880 --> 35:42.440
I was only trying to help.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.160
I really don't want to die.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.040
I don't want you to die.

35:47.040 --> 35:50.200
Not yet.
Not here, anyway.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.760
But come on, chop chop. You've only
got a few more moments

35:52.760 --> 35:56.080
of consciousness left
and I'd hate to have to carry you.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.760
All right.

35:58.760 --> 36:00.840
I'll do whatever you say.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.480
Smile and walk, that's all.

36:03.480 --> 36:07.440
Call out or try to run
and I'll just change my plans

36:07.440 --> 36:10.360
and kill you on the spot.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.920
Now move.

36:18.160 --> 36:22.360
You were in pain.
You lost the woman you loved.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.080
But this ends now.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.840
What are you planning to do
to Mrs McCarthy?

36:36.280 --> 36:40.000
Don't make me run, Mick.
Don't make me...

36:46.240 --> 36:48.800
Nice try.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.720
What are you planning?
You'll see.

36:51.720 --> 36:55.160
Father. That smoke's
coming from the Presbytery.

36:55.160 --> 36:56.760
What about him?!

37:09.120 --> 37:12.160
What have you given me?

37:12.160 --> 37:14.920
Just a little something I brought
over from the States.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.760
It's all the rage over there.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.720
In small doses, it helps you to lose
weight, allegedly.

37:20.720 --> 37:24.120
Too much, though, and your blood
sugar drops through the floor,

37:24.120 --> 37:26.000
you lose consciousness,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.280
fall into a coma,

37:27.280 --> 37:28.440
and die.

37:30.520 --> 37:34.240
Very much like starving to death.
But quicker.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.960
Please, Father.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.200
Mrs M? Mrs M?
Are you in here?

37:46.200 --> 37:48.520
Hello? Mrs M?

37:55.200 --> 37:56.440
No sign of her.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.600
Nor Miss Nellins.
The cafe's locked.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.880
Do you think the smoke was
a distress call?Probably.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.320
Then where is she?!
I'll check her house.

38:03.320 --> 38:06.400
Wait, Walter Penmark and Peggy
Langdon both died

38:06.400 --> 38:08.760
where they
received their messages.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.800
Him in his study,
her in her garden.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.640
Mrs M got hers in...

38:15.440 --> 38:18.760
Sweet dreams. Must dash.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.400
Mr Belcroft has offered
to buy my cafe.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.160
I'm returning to America.

38:25.640 --> 38:29.560
I was going to get the doctor.
Mrs McCarthy is unwell.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.800
Mrs McCarthy? Can you hear me?

38:34.800 --> 38:37.120
What've you done?
Me? Nothing.

38:37.120 --> 38:40.440
Don't lie, Ruby.
You're in a house of God.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.320
It always comes back to God.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.200
Fetch an ambulance.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.480
Hold on. Please.

38:49.480 --> 38:53.720
She can't hear you.
It's appropriate that it ends here.

38:53.720 --> 38:58.720
Where it all began.
The hypocrisy. The petty malice.

38:58.720 --> 39:02.280
Do you blame God
for your sister's death?

39:02.280 --> 39:03.800
I blame people.

39:03.800 --> 39:07.200
For making Frances feel ashamed
and afraid.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.800
That's why the winged dagger is
so appropriate.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.200
A symbol of violence

39:12.200 --> 39:15.280
and fear masquerading
as righteousness.

39:15.280 --> 39:19.520
Do not sully your sister's memory

39:19.520 --> 39:22.560
by speaking of this as
an act of love.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.400
What do you think your sister would
feel

39:28.400 --> 39:32.360
seeing you destroying the lives
of others in her name?

39:34.080 --> 39:36.720
Destroying your own life?

39:36.720 --> 39:38.800
I don't care what happens to me.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.560
You will.

39:40.560 --> 39:44.720
When the dust settles
and the grief is still there.

39:45.880 --> 39:50.400
When you realise your vengeance has
achieved nothing,

39:50.400 --> 39:53.040
solved nothing.

39:54.440 --> 39:59.600
And this will haunt you for
the rest of your life.

39:59.600 --> 40:03.280
Ambulance is coming,
but it'll be a while.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.960
What have you given her.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.440
It's too late.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.920
Not if I wring your neck, it's not.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.040
Sid.

40:13.320 --> 40:16.160
Bridgit, God is with you.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.680
He will help you to fight this.

40:18.680 --> 40:21.280
Why? Ruby?

40:21.280 --> 40:23.800
If it hadn't been for Mrs McCarthy,

40:23.800 --> 40:25.480
Frances would have left Walter.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.320
She could have been happy.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.800
Listen to your heart.

40:29.800 --> 40:33.160
Frances would not have wanted this.

40:33.160 --> 40:36.160
And what about what I want?

40:36.160 --> 40:38.240
I want my sister back.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.520
I want this pain to stop.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.080
This pain?

40:46.080 --> 40:47.360
It's guilt.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.400
Guilt, that you weren't there.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.320
Guilt, that you couldn't save her.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.160
But you can save her friend.

41:00.680 --> 41:04.280
Because whatever advice
Mrs McCarthy gave,

41:04.280 --> 41:07.000
she was her friend.

41:08.840 --> 41:11.800
And she's my friend, too.

41:13.640 --> 41:16.640
And I am begging you,

41:16.640 --> 41:20.160
don't let my friend die.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.600
Chemist. Activated charcoal.

41:39.320 --> 41:41.760
I just want my sister back.

41:48.040 --> 41:51.600
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum.

41:51.600 --> 41:54.440
Benedicta tu in mulieribus,

41:54.440 --> 42:00.360
et benedictus fructus ventris tui,
Iesus. Christos.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.440
Mick Bidley didn't get far.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.560
We nabbed him trying to get on
a bus in Hambleston.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.960
Put up a bit of a fight
but nothing my men couldn't handle.

42:20.960 --> 42:24.160
And Ruby Nellins has made
a full confession.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.680
I shall pray for them both.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.600
Poor Frances.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.400
I only wish she'd told
me everything.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.600
Maybe I could have done more
to help her.

42:32.600 --> 42:35.320
Your words came with
the best intentions.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.600
Still, I'll be more careful about
what advice

42:38.600 --> 42:41.120
I offer in the future.

42:41.120 --> 42:44.560
And after what happened
to Peggy Langdon,

42:44.560 --> 42:47.480
I certainly won't be listening
to any more idle gossip.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.680
Glad to hear it, Mrs M.

42:49.680 --> 42:52.320
By the way,
I had a word with Mr Fredericks

42:52.320 --> 42:54.280
and he's agreed
to let you back in the shop.

42:54.280 --> 42:58.200
Reckons, under the circumstances,
you've been punished enough.

42:58.200 --> 43:02.080
Oh, that's very civil of him.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.960
We'll leave you to rest.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.720
That's the third gentleman caller
she's had today.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.320
What?
Nothing.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.320
I wasn't casting aspersions.

43:24.320 --> 43:27.120
We're just really glad that you're
on the mend, Mrs M.
