everything I can.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.277
Listen, Tom, you don't have to do this.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.530
-I do have to.
-You said you wanted out.

40:56.746 --> 40:59.954
Out of the secrets and the lies
and the risk.

41:00.249 --> 41:02.035
I don’t wanna drag you back into this.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.293
-You're not. You haven't.
-Listen, Tom, you don't understand.

41:06.089 --> 41:08.125
I have done...

41:11.511 --> 41:14.423
-I have hurt so many people.
-I don't care what you've done.

41:14.639 --> 41:15.879
Liz, I know who you are.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.925
I took that for granted for a long time,
but I don't now.

41:20.103 --> 41:22.594
You're right. I do have plans.
I'm coming to save you.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.437
-Tom. Listen--
-lt's too late.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.265
-Because I'm already in.
-In where?

41:27.485 --> 41:29.350
Where are you? What have you done?

41:29.529 --> 41:31.065
I gotta go. I love you.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.400
[w]

41:43.710 --> 41:45.450
So, what's good around here?

41:47.880 --> 41:49.541
Follow me.

41:57.098 --> 41:59.089
[w]
