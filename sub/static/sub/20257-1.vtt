00:31.366 --> 00:32.843
Do you realize
what's happening in the market?

00:32.867 --> 00:34.000
You're dreaming, Tony.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.868
You know it's a fair offer,

00:35.903 --> 00:37.748
and you get to look like a hero
presenting it to your client.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.238
Fiona, I know you.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.272
Then you know
you should listen to me.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.540
I don't know.

00:41.576 --> 00:44.388
Another few weeks on the market,
who knows what my client'll get.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.645
My guess?

00:45.680 --> 00:47.360
Some shaky offers
and an angry co-op board.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.294
Come on, what's it going to take
to close this deal

00:50.318 --> 00:52.358
and give a nice grandma
and her pekinese a new home?

00:58.092 --> 00:59.425
We've got a deal,

00:59.460 --> 01:01.795
and you have got a rooftop
apartment by the river!

01:02.930 --> 01:04.241
Well, they must have had
a hundred offers, Fiona!

01:04.265 --> 01:05.498
How did you do it?

01:05.533 --> 01:08.100
Just a little creative financing
and a whole lot of begging.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.568
Thank you.

01:09.604 --> 01:10.814
Location is everything.
You're going to love the place.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.439
You are amazing.
Let's celebrate!

01:13.474 --> 01:15.509
I can't, I'm sorry,
but congratulations.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.676
Thank you.

01:16.711 --> 01:17.711
Really happy for you.

01:20.515 --> 01:23.560
Nate, hi. Listen, I'm grabbing
an uber, and I'll be there.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.884
Okay. See you soon.

01:26.521 --> 01:27.787
Andy?

01:27.822 --> 01:29.655
Hi, so are we done
for the night?

01:29.691 --> 01:31.602
What... no, no, no!
They can't leave town tonight.

01:31.626 --> 01:33.592
I am showing them
the two-bedroom tomorrow.

01:33.628 --> 01:35.788
The location's amazing.
It's right by the kids' school.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.897
Now?

01:37.965 --> 01:39.765
I just told Nate
I would meet him.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.413
You know what?
Sure. I can do both.

01:42.437 --> 01:43.437
Okay, see you soon.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.375
Hey, can I...
Can I get a drink?

01:52.246 --> 01:53.379
Nate!
Nate, I am so sorry.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.047
Fiona.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.415
Finally.

01:56.451 --> 01:57.895
I know, my schedule was
just timed to the minute,

01:57.919 --> 01:59.618
and the uber I was in
clipped a food truck,

01:59.654 --> 02:02.288
so I had to get out and jog
the last eight blocks, and...

02:02.323 --> 02:03.956
Listen, I know
this was important to you.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.169
Yeah, the partners
only meet twice a year.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.537
And I'll make it up
to you, I promise.

02:06.561 --> 02:09.127
My schedule this time of year
is just a blitz.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.263
We are a great couple
when we see each other,

02:11.299 --> 02:13.265
but I'm not dating
your schedule,

02:13.301 --> 02:16.302
and lately, it seems like
you never have time for me.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.336
So I'll make time.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.472
Fiona, we are who we are.

02:22.110 --> 02:24.877
I just think that maybe...

02:24.912 --> 02:27.079
Maybe we want different things.

02:28.816 --> 02:29.749
What are you saying?

02:29.817 --> 02:33.352
Well, that I'm tired of being
just one more ball in your juggling act.

02:33.421 --> 02:36.455
Yes, I may be
juggling, but I've...

02:36.524 --> 02:37.757
I've never dropped you.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.027
Are you dropping me?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.798
I think I'm just doing
what's best for both of us.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.605
You're doing great, just great.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.140
I'll see you in two weeks.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.142
Thank you, doctor.
I feel much better.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.617
Please tell me
that you have good news.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.319
I have been listening
to sad stories all day long.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.054
Nate dumped me last night.

03:09.090 --> 03:09.922
<i>What?</i>

03:09.991 --> 03:12.124
Honey.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.959
I know, I'm just in shock.

03:13.995 --> 03:15.161
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

03:15.196 --> 03:19.832
You know what they say.
Men are like melons.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.044
It's tough to pick a good one.

03:21.068 --> 03:25.571
But he was a good one, and I thought
we were destined to be together.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.907
I guess destiny
fell asleep on the job.

03:27.942 --> 03:30.209
<i>Ange, what am I doing wrong?</i>

03:30.244 --> 03:31.744
Nate and I had something
so special.

03:31.813 --> 03:33.145
<i>Well, why don't we meet up?</i>

03:33.181 --> 03:36.115
You know, there's no problem that
a good chocolate mousse can't fix.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.795
What, did you learn that
in advanced psych?

03:37.819 --> 03:39.418
<i>No, I'd love to,</i>

03:39.453 --> 03:41.353
but Irwin lanheim
is about to stop by,

03:41.389 --> 03:43.556
so who knows,
that could be trouble.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.292
<i>Well, you are you,
and you can handle anything.</i>

03:46.327 --> 03:48.928
Fiona, try to...

03:48.963 --> 03:51.197
Schedule some time
for your feelings.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.865
I will.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.060
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

03:56.037 --> 03:57.037
Thank you.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.071
Fiona!

03:58.105 --> 03:59.305
Hi!

03:59.373 --> 04:01.373
It's been too long.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.142
Yes. I read about the merger.
Well done.

04:03.177 --> 04:04.076
Yes!

04:04.145 --> 04:06.423
Quite the compliment from the
toast of New York Real Estate.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.091
Well, it sounds better
than just being toast.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.982
Yes, it certainly does.

04:10.051 --> 04:11.550
How are the newlyweds?

04:12.653 --> 04:14.353
Kimberly left me.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.308
In fact, the papers
were just filed this morning.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.557
I'm so sorry.

04:18.593 --> 04:19.959
No, it is what it is.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.171
We're kind of in the same boat.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.195
You and Nate?

04:22.230 --> 04:24.230
Yeah, we're on a...
We're on a bit of a break.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.030
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:25.066 --> 04:28.167
Unfortunately, when you work
as hard as you and I do,

04:28.202 --> 04:30.135
sometimes relationships
tend to be...

04:30.171 --> 04:31.470
A little bit difficult.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.873
Yeah, my parents somehow
found a way to make it work.

04:33.908 --> 04:36.442
Hey, how is your father?
Is he still in Vermont?

04:36.477 --> 04:38.244
He's still running the Inn
with my stepmom.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.745
What's it been,
like, five years?

04:39.780 --> 04:43.349
I have to say, the city's a lot
less fun without my old rival.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.316
Yeah.

04:44.352 --> 04:47.887
I actually passed our old apartment
on the way over, and...

04:47.955 --> 04:51.423
I just can't believe
my dad up and left the city.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.691
I'm sorry.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.137
You did not come here
to listen to me lament.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.061
Fiona, this city
is your passion.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.797
You take after your mother,
and it's that passion

04:58.833 --> 05:01.834
that helped you build such a great
business, but you could do better.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.870
In fact,
with the merger complete,

05:04.906 --> 05:07.873
I want you to run the new real
estate arm of my banking interests.

05:07.942 --> 05:11.310
Irwin, I'm honored, but
my business is great as it is.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.544
I'm my own boss.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.246
- Why would I want to change that?
- Because you've got a problem.

05:14.282 --> 05:16.215
- I do?
- There's only one of you.

05:16.250 --> 05:20.452
Can you imagine what you could do
with a staff of ten, or a hundred?

05:20.488 --> 05:24.556
You can craft the Manhattan skyline
like it's your own set of tinkertoys.

05:26.394 --> 05:29.362
Okay.
Just think about it...

05:30.298 --> 05:31.298
But...

05:32.733 --> 05:34.900
Not for too long?

05:47.748 --> 05:49.326
I shouldn't have come.
I'm not brunch-ready yet.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.083
Sure you are.

05:51.118 --> 05:55.087
You've been working nonstop for...
What's it been now, three weeks?

05:55.122 --> 05:56.922
What, since Nate?

05:56.958 --> 06:00.159
22 days and 13 hours,
but, I mean, who's counting?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.795
I'm so glad you're not obsessing.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.863
You remind me
of a patient that I have.

06:04.899 --> 06:08.400
Every session,
he obsesses about his cat.

06:08.436 --> 06:11.103
Isn't there something called
"patient confidentiality?"

06:11.138 --> 06:13.906
Don't be boring,
and don't block your feelings.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.475
I just can't believe
that Nate dumped me!

06:16.544 --> 06:18.544
If I could just pay
for my feelings to go away...

06:18.579 --> 06:19.957
How do you think
I paid for my condo?

06:19.981 --> 06:21.814
Never mind.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.349
You know what your problem is?

06:23.417 --> 06:26.485
You never slow down long enough
for you to actually have feelings.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.120
Wait, hold that thought.

06:28.189 --> 06:29.722
My point exactly.

06:31.359 --> 06:32.970
You know, Nate and I
used to love this place.

06:32.994 --> 06:34.660
Yeah, he would get
the Reuben on Rye.

06:34.729 --> 06:35.461
It was his favorite.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.296
Fiona?

06:37.365 --> 06:38.542
You're going to have to move on.

06:38.566 --> 06:42.167
But every relationship that I'm in,
it just falls apart.

06:42.203 --> 06:44.036
Angela, what if I'm
alone permanently?

06:44.105 --> 06:46.405
Really, what if I'm like
that half duplex

06:46.440 --> 06:47.880
that just sits on
the market forever?

06:49.176 --> 06:51.043
You need a fresh perspective.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.846
You know, I think we could both
use a holiday out of town.

06:53.881 --> 06:54.925
What, you mean like a vacation?

06:54.949 --> 06:55.949
Yeah.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.583
It'll shake things up
a little...

06:57.618 --> 06:58.829
You know, get your mind
off of Nate.

06:58.853 --> 07:01.086
We could come back here
with a fresh start.

07:01.155 --> 07:03.122
I know just the place.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.456
We should go visit your dad.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.824
I've always wanted
to see the Inn.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.459
The Inn?

07:07.495 --> 07:08.727
I don't know.

07:08.763 --> 07:12.197
My stepmom is still upset with me
for not visiting since last summer, and...

07:12.233 --> 07:14.299
Well, you know
my dad and I have issues.

07:14.335 --> 07:16.235
You need a change of scenery.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.737
I mean, let's face it...

07:18.773 --> 07:22.307
Manhattan is ground-zero
for happy couples.

07:22.343 --> 07:23.854
I mean, holding hands
through Central Park,

07:23.878 --> 07:27.413
shopping along Fifth Avenue,
brunching at places like this...

07:27.448 --> 07:30.416
I mean, look. Look!
Don't you see my point?

07:30.451 --> 07:32.317
My point exactly.

07:34.155 --> 07:36.288
You sold me.
When do we leave?

07:40.528 --> 07:42.361
<i>Inn at Swan Lake.
May I help you?</i>

07:42.396 --> 07:44.730
- Hi, it's Fiona.
- Fiona!

07:44.799 --> 07:47.966
Hi, honey.
How are you doing?

07:48.002 --> 07:49.212
Listen, Delia, first,
before you say anything,

07:49.236 --> 07:51.737
I'm sorry it's been so long
since I visited.

07:51.772 --> 07:55.774
Honey, it's understandable.
I just miss you. Well, we all do.

07:55.810 --> 07:56.987
<i>Well, that's actually
why I'm calling,</i>

07:57.011 --> 07:58.811
'cause Angela and I
thought it would be nice

07:58.846 --> 08:01.013
to come up
and see you guys for a few days.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.651
<i>Oh, good!</i>

08:04.685 --> 08:06.485
So I take it you're excited?

08:06.520 --> 08:07.986
Yes, yes.

08:08.022 --> 08:10.789
Listen, we'll just stay four or five
days, but only if you have the room.

08:10.825 --> 08:13.525
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course we have room...

08:13.561 --> 08:15.338
And Fiona, your timing
couldn't be more perfect.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.262
Maplefaire kicks off this weekend!

08:18.466 --> 08:19.743
Okay, great,
then we'll see you tomorrow.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.067
Love you, and...
Send my love to dad.

08:22.103 --> 08:23.068
Thanks.

08:23.104 --> 08:24.636
- Fiona.
- Irwin!

08:24.672 --> 08:27.272
Hi, I wasn't expecting
to see you.

08:27.308 --> 08:29.608
And I wasn't expecting
to have to chase you down.

08:29.643 --> 08:33.111
I'm sorry. I...
I really have to apologize.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.013
Am I detecting
a bit of hesitation?

08:35.049 --> 08:36.482
No.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.183
I'm just going up to visit
my dad in Vermont, and...

08:39.253 --> 08:41.587
This is an offer of a lifetime.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.455
You'll be the queen
of New York Real Estate.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.491
What more could you want?

08:45.526 --> 08:47.126
Just a few more days
to clear my head.

08:47.161 --> 08:48.427
All right.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.629
- Give your father my best.
- I will.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.198
- We'll talk soon.
- Absolutely. Thank you.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.775
It is so pretty here.

09:03.811 --> 09:07.012
Fun fact, did you know Vermont
has more cows per capita

09:07.047 --> 09:08.213
than any other State?

09:08.282 --> 09:10.482
And apparently,
it snows in the springtime.

09:10.518 --> 09:12.050
It's beautiful.

09:12.086 --> 09:14.664
Yeah, can you check my phone and
see if we have service yet, please?

09:14.688 --> 09:16.255
No, no, no more work!

09:16.323 --> 09:18.490
What, just because I'm out of town
doesn't mean my clients need to know that.

09:18.526 --> 09:19.491
Okay, you've got to let it go.

09:19.527 --> 09:22.162
- You are here to relax and enjoy.
- And forget.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.631
You know, I am nervous
about seeing my dad.

09:25.666 --> 09:29.301
Well, you've got five whole days
of heartfelt healing ahead.

09:29.336 --> 09:33.772
And some heartfelt grilling from my
stepmom about why Nate and I broke up...

09:33.807 --> 09:34.807
And we're here.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.551
Well...

09:45.586 --> 09:48.987
Welcome to paradise...
Or Siberia.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.455
It's like the frozen tundra.

09:50.491 --> 09:52.424
This is adorable!
I love it.

09:52.459 --> 09:56.795
Well, Vermont is beautiful, but, I mean,
this only cost me my childhood home.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.230
Oh, you poor thing.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.101
Who's that?

10:03.137 --> 10:05.003
Is that a groundskeeper
or something?

10:05.039 --> 10:07.807
I don't know.
He's cute, though.

10:08.576 --> 10:09.576
I have service.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.478
What part of "I'm on vacation"
do you not understand?

10:15.282 --> 10:18.016
This is definitely
not Manhattan.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.219
That's gross.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.088
Hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:23.123 --> 10:24.156
What are you doing?

10:24.191 --> 10:26.369
I'm just... I'm just getting rid
of these mushrooms.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.638
I mean, eyesores like that can
really decrease the property's value.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.696
They're not just mushrooms.

10:30.731 --> 10:34.266
- They're oyster mushrooms.
- Okay. Oyster mushrooms. Sorry.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.001
They're really delicious,

10:36.070 --> 10:38.048
and they're extremely rare
for this early in the season.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.105
Well, I didn't mean
to interrupt your harvest.

10:40.174 --> 10:42.941
I've still got to take
mushroom soup off the menu.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.476
Menu?

10:44.511 --> 10:45.644
Wait, menu for what?

10:46.814 --> 10:47.713
Fi!

10:47.748 --> 10:48.547
What menu?

10:48.582 --> 10:49.414
Brandon!

10:49.450 --> 10:50.349
Hey!

10:51.252 --> 10:52.252
Hey.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.689
- Hey, Brandon.
- Angela.

10:58.626 --> 10:59.958
The trouble twins return.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.461
What, are you still sore
about those sno-cones?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.329
Sno-cones
that ended up on my head?

11:04.365 --> 11:08.133
Okay, from how I recall it,
I was ten.

11:08.202 --> 11:09.301
You pulled my hair first.

11:09.370 --> 11:10.936
Fi, back me up on this.

11:11.005 --> 11:12.482
Me? No, no, I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.939
Wait, are you still living here?

11:13.974 --> 11:17.909
It's only temporary...
Just like it was last summer.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.723
And the summer before that,
and the summer before that.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.547
I know, but you know what?
I won't knock it.

11:22.583 --> 11:24.449
Helping dad
keep this place running

11:24.485 --> 11:27.119
is a better workout
than I ever had at any gym,

11:27.154 --> 11:29.288
although I do miss being
in the center of things.

11:29.323 --> 11:32.257
I'm sure your tech-wizard
side will rise again.

11:32.293 --> 11:33.992
I hope you're right.

11:34.028 --> 11:35.827
You guys get inside.
I'll grab your bags.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.429
Thanks.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.331
He's working out now?
He looks good.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.900
The place looks great.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.502
They're here!

11:45.172 --> 11:47.606
Hello! Hi!

11:48.575 --> 11:50.909
Hi! Delia, hi.

11:50.944 --> 11:51.743
Hi!

11:51.779 --> 11:52.577
Hello, Angela!

11:52.613 --> 11:53.912
My gosh,

11:53.981 --> 11:55.814
it's been so long
since I've seen you!

11:55.849 --> 11:57.215
I know. It's my fault.

11:57.251 --> 11:58.628
I mean, it only has been
since last summer, though.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.219
Well, when you run an Inn,
that's 200 bookings ago,

12:01.255 --> 12:03.155
so for me,
it feels like forever.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.856
I'm just so glad that you're home.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.992
Do we have to call it "home?"

12:07.027 --> 12:08.427
Yes.

12:08.462 --> 12:12.998
You and your father are going to leave
this little tiff behind you on this trip. Okay?

12:13.033 --> 12:15.133
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.668
The towels are out of the dryer,

12:16.704 --> 12:19.271
but we better get 'em folded
before the new check-ins arrive.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.573
Well, some of the new check-ins
are already here.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.608
Dad.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.510
Welcome home.

12:25.546 --> 12:27.379
Er... welcome... here.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.981
So...

12:30.017 --> 12:32.484
- How's life in the Big Apple?
- Great.

12:32.553 --> 12:34.419
This might refresh your memory.

12:34.455 --> 12:35.732
Got you a bottle
of your favorite perfume

12:35.756 --> 12:37.222
from Fifth Avenue.

12:37.291 --> 12:38.190
You didn't have to do that.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.524
No, it's nothing.

12:39.593 --> 12:40.492
Well, thank you.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.760
And Harris,

12:41.795 --> 12:42.627
some real bagels from zabar's.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.730
Oh ho ho ho!

12:44.765 --> 12:47.199
Thank you both.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.601
There he is.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.337
Fiona, this is Derek.

12:52.373 --> 12:53.638
Studied in Paris.

12:53.707 --> 12:56.708
He's a culinary genius,
and the Inn's pride and joy.

12:56.744 --> 12:58.176
The wise-guy groundskeeper?

12:59.179 --> 13:00.045
He's our new head chef,

13:00.114 --> 13:01.446
and fingers crossed,

13:01.482 --> 13:03.815
soon to be the first
Michelin Star chef in Vermont.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.985
I believe we've met before,

13:07.020 --> 13:10.489
and mushroom soup
is still off the menu.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.068
Yeah, he's very protective
over his mushrooms.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.425
Yeah,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.727
and a true artist
who needs to focus.

13:17.398 --> 13:18.330
I've persuaded some
of the top restaurant bloggers

13:18.365 --> 13:19.231
in New England

13:19.299 --> 13:20.265
to come later this week,

13:20.300 --> 13:23.602
so he needs to be in prime form.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.270
Bookings have been down
a little bit,

13:25.305 --> 13:26.571
and we could use the press.

13:26.607 --> 13:28.907
Tomorrow,
we have more guests arriving,

13:28.976 --> 13:31.710
and thanks to Brandon,
we've updated our web site,

13:31.745 --> 13:34.146
and we're starting to market
to the hip millennial crowd.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.714
"Hip millennial crowd?"

13:35.749 --> 13:38.149
That just does not sound right
coming out of your mouth, dad.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.452
Which reminds me...

13:40.487 --> 13:41.487
Oh, yeah.

13:41.522 --> 13:42.421
Let me get you girls

13:42.456 --> 13:43.422
all settled up
in your rooms, okay?

13:43.457 --> 13:44.589
Great.

13:44.625 --> 13:45.924
You can relax,

13:45.959 --> 13:47.392
and enjoy yourself,

13:47.428 --> 13:48.693
and then later on,

13:48.729 --> 13:50.649
you can tell me all about
your breakup with Nate.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.798
Right this way.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.833
Yay. Can't wait.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.589
Come on.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.633
I'm trapped in farmville.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.688
Um, are you aware
it's not even 6:00 a.m.?

14:51.225 --> 14:52.524
Well, then I'm late.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.593
This should've been done
by 5:30.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.995
Isn't it a little early
for all this racket?

14:57.064 --> 15:02.400
If I don't get this birch cut,
there'll be no smoked salmon for dinner.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.835
New York Princess.

15:03.871 --> 15:05.504
Vermont lumberjack.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.479
- Can I help you?
- No, thanks.

15:14.515 --> 15:17.682
You were already helpful enough
with the wake-up call.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.452
It's my kitchen,
so what can I get for you?

15:22.322 --> 15:24.834
We got off on a rocky start, but
why don't you just do your thing,

15:24.858 --> 15:27.637
and I'm going to grab some food,
and I will just go for a run.

15:27.661 --> 15:28.727
Again...

15:29.796 --> 15:30.796
My kitchen.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.665
Fine, have it your way.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.420
I'm on a gluten-free,
no-soy, no-dairy diet.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.302
Food allergies?

15:37.337 --> 15:39.082
No, my nutritionist has
this amazing food blog...

15:39.106 --> 15:40.106
What are you doing?

15:40.140 --> 15:41.907
Don't worry.
I've got breakfast covered.

15:41.942 --> 15:42.942
You're going to love it.

15:44.511 --> 15:45.977
I am?

15:46.013 --> 15:47.112
Maybe I don't drink coffee.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.680
You? Please.

15:54.588 --> 15:55.588
That's good.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.291
You should know,
I'm actually, um...

15:59.326 --> 16:01.037
Actually usually just
steering clear of carbs.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.961
Well, until now.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.435
We are literally
watching paint dry.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.037
Just give me a second.

16:16.910 --> 16:18.944
My cell gets
really bad reception here.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.323
Do you know
where there's better service?

16:20.347 --> 16:22.881
The world can't function
for a day without your input?

16:22.916 --> 16:25.383
That wasn't the question.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.319
Try outside.
A high place...

16:27.354 --> 16:28.653
A hill?

16:28.689 --> 16:30.121
A barn? A horse?

16:30.157 --> 16:32.490
Thank you.
You've been so helpful.

16:35.729 --> 16:36.729
Well?

16:37.898 --> 16:39.531
It's not terrible.

16:50.611 --> 16:52.477
Oh, my goodness.
So good...

17:00.854 --> 17:02.420
Ho.
Not terrible.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.300
Hey!

17:20.773 --> 17:23.775
Good morning to you too.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.578
C'mon, signal...
Signal, signal...

17:26.613 --> 17:28.012
Signal! Signal! Yes!

17:29.249 --> 17:30.715
Hi.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.150
Hi, Andy!
Andy, listen.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.596
I've gotta talk fast
'cause I may lose signal,

17:33.620 --> 17:35.231
but I need you to check
the kovacs escrow because...

17:35.255 --> 17:36.454
Andy? Andy, Andy, Andy?

17:37.424 --> 17:38.556
No Andy.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.266
Hi, swatch.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.936
Help me out a second.
I'm late on brunch.

17:51.972 --> 17:53.416
Wait, is this where
this rooster lives?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.973
'Cause he and I
are having a talk.

17:55.008 --> 17:57.275
Yeah, I named him "swatch".

17:57.310 --> 17:58.576
He thinks he's a clock.

17:58.612 --> 18:01.312
I mean, do you think he knows
how to get a cell phone signal?

18:01.348 --> 18:02.714
This is Vermont.
It's not Timbuktu.

18:02.783 --> 18:05.283
Signal's pretty sketchy up here.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.852
Anyway, aren't you supposed
to be relaxing

18:07.888 --> 18:09.488
after that nasty little breakup
of yours?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.769
Staff gossips.
Probably wise you learn that now.

18:12.793 --> 18:13.658
Well, you know what?

18:13.694 --> 18:17.208
It's no wonder, considering there's
absolutely nothing to do up here.

18:17.764 --> 18:18.930
There's plenty to do out here.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.031
Really?

18:20.067 --> 18:21.077
What, like growing your own herbs?

18:21.101 --> 18:22.178
'Cause that looks real entertaining.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.668
Exactly.

18:23.704 --> 18:26.805
Everything I serve
is locally sourced,

18:26.840 --> 18:29.708
and what I can't grow,
I buy from local farms...

18:29.743 --> 18:33.044
- Well, mostly.
- Mostly?

18:33.113 --> 18:35.447
Sometimes I can't get the
vegetables I really need,

18:35.482 --> 18:37.615
but I'm working on a solution.

18:37.651 --> 18:39.451
And what's that?

18:39.519 --> 18:42.654
The neighbor is selling off one of the
fields on his farms, the fella up the road?

18:42.689 --> 18:45.417
Yeah, the kind of cranky guy
who favors plaid?

18:46.526 --> 18:47.959
That's him.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.228
Only problem is, old Chauncey
refuses to sell to me.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.498
I'm... shocked that you would
rub someone the wrong way.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.068
Thank you.
I have a brunch to prepare.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.118
If your old pals on Wall Street
could see you now.

19:21.728 --> 19:22.728
Look around.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.932
This place holds more value to me
than any portfolio ever could.

19:27.968 --> 19:30.735
I could not be happier here.

19:30.771 --> 19:33.037
I think maybe you could be happy
here someday too.

19:33.073 --> 19:34.606
You think that's possible?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.853
Dad, I would have been happy
with our old place by the park,

19:36.877 --> 19:39.577
but... we both know
that ship's sailed.

19:41.815 --> 19:44.215
Why do you always have
to bring up the past?

19:44.251 --> 19:45.884
Why do you always
want to forget it?

19:45.919 --> 19:47.886
I mean, I know you
deserved a fresh start,

19:47.954 --> 19:49.921
but that was my history too.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.891
Just would have been nice
to know you were selling.

19:52.926 --> 19:55.693
You were in college,
and besides, it had to be done.

19:55.729 --> 19:59.798
Look... I've got a million things
I've got to do.

19:59.833 --> 20:02.600
We've got a beautiful weekend
shaping up.

20:02.636 --> 20:06.004
Brandon's online promotions
are starting to pay off.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.839
It's going to be
a beautiful weekend.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.008
- Let's get some coffee.
- Okay.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.215
Okay, there's French press
in the kitchen.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.683
All right?

20:18.718 --> 20:22.720
Hey, you made it! I heard
about the mess on the mass pike?

20:22.756 --> 20:25.790
Hang on, I gotcha here.

20:25.859 --> 20:26.859
There we go.

20:30.997 --> 20:34.399
There you are! You know, you could
sleep through an explosion.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.568
Not an explosion of flavor.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.703
Fi, this omelette is amazing.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.871
The chef here is a genius.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.506
He sure thinks so.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.740
Listen...

20:42.776 --> 20:45.109
We've got to get out of here.
This place is infested!

20:46.046 --> 20:48.146
- With what?
- With couples!

20:48.181 --> 20:50.515
We left the Big Apple,
and we ended up in Mayberry.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.816
Look around you.

20:51.852 --> 20:54.285
We got lovebirds over here
dressed for hiking,

20:54.321 --> 20:56.199
and mustache-Mike and blondie,
they're checking in,

20:56.223 --> 20:57.856
and this happy couple over here,

20:57.891 --> 20:59.669
they're probably celebrating
the first time they kissed!

20:59.693 --> 21:02.293
I mean, where is the subway noise
when I need it?

21:02.329 --> 21:04.062
Okay, honey, we just got here!

21:04.097 --> 21:05.274
Yeah, and we can be home by dinner.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.598
Are you kidding me?

21:06.633 --> 21:08.833
No, there's lots of great stuff
for us to do here!

21:08.869 --> 21:11.536
You need to open yourself up
to new experiences.

21:11.605 --> 21:12.770
I've got one word for you...

21:12.806 --> 21:14.072
Maplefaire.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.107
Yeah, I've heard about it.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.609
Some local ritual
involving trees.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.011
I've managed to avoid it
all these years.

21:20.046 --> 21:23.047
Yup, "five days of rustic
festivities around town".

21:23.116 --> 21:24.616
Look, this looks super fun!

21:24.651 --> 21:27.719
And it starts today.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.655
Fine. Whatever.
Just... anywhere but here.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.426
You have to try this.

21:56.683 --> 22:00.551
Hey, did you know you can get
a maple sugar scrub facial here?

22:00.587 --> 22:02.231
You're not going Vermont
on me already, are you?

22:02.255 --> 22:05.924
Well, hey, country life
sure looks good on your little bro.

22:05.959 --> 22:07.625
You've played before,
haven't you?

22:07.661 --> 22:09.294
Yeah!
Congratulations!

22:09.362 --> 22:10.895
He's not so little anymore.

22:11.865 --> 22:12.997
Here you go.

22:13.033 --> 22:14.866
Congratulations.

22:14.935 --> 22:16.167
Great.
Look who's here.

22:16.202 --> 22:19.537
Yes, Derek's doing
a cooking demonstration.

22:19.572 --> 22:21.739
The great thing about
a small community

22:21.775 --> 22:24.543
is that you can run into familiar
faces everywhere you turn.

22:24.611 --> 22:27.512
And the great thing about New York
is you can lose yourself in a crowd.

22:27.580 --> 22:28.791
So with the scallops
golden brown,

22:28.815 --> 22:31.215
we add in some of Vermont's
finest maple syrup...

22:32.385 --> 22:34.052
Reduce that down.

22:34.087 --> 22:37.488
The maple actually brings out
the natural sweetness in the scallops...

22:38.758 --> 22:41.960
And voila,
maple-glazed sea scallops.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.028
I thought you said
you only cooked

22:44.064 --> 22:45.308
with locally sourced
ingredients.

22:45.332 --> 22:49.378
Vermont has no coast, so I'm guessing
you went rogue with the sea scallops?

22:49.402 --> 22:52.337
I see we have a heckler.
This might interest you.

22:52.372 --> 22:56.541
At one time, Vermont was claimed
by both New York and New Hampshire

22:56.609 --> 22:59.177
until the green mountain boys
defended our land claims.

22:59.245 --> 23:02.714
These scallops are from New Hampshire,
so how about we make peace

23:02.749 --> 23:05.483
and just call them
"Vermont-adjacent scallops"?

23:05.518 --> 23:07.151
And how do you know all that?

23:07.187 --> 23:09.020
My mother is
eighth-generation Vermonter.

23:09.089 --> 23:10.221
And that's a good thing?

23:10.256 --> 23:12.557
Excuse me. Marilyn!

23:16.529 --> 23:17.829
Pardon the interruption.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.497
City folk.

23:19.532 --> 23:22.066
He is so annoying.

23:22.102 --> 23:23.446
Come on, Fi, let's at
least have some fun.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.036
Ladies!

23:25.071 --> 23:28.206
Step up and take a shot!
One dollar gets you one dart.

23:28.274 --> 23:31.642
Hit a balloon, and win
some sweet, sweet prizes!

23:31.711 --> 23:33.411
Yes! Yes!
We should play!

23:33.446 --> 23:35.646
It'll be a healthy
release of aggression.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.849
No, I'm not in the mood.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.118
This whole thing reminds me
of coney island, and...

23:40.153 --> 23:41.397
Remember
when Nate won me that bear?

23:41.421 --> 23:44.000
Fi, come on, we're here to relax
and have a good time.

23:45.258 --> 23:48.493
And there's no $200 mani-pedi
places up here.

23:48.528 --> 23:51.429
By the way,
you're my ride back to the Inn.

23:51.464 --> 23:52.964
Lucky me.

23:53.033 --> 23:54.298
Can't wait.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.334
You know what?
Actually, ange... Why not?

23:56.369 --> 23:57.468
Yes!

23:57.504 --> 23:59.470
All right, let's do this.
I'll take one, please.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.640
Here you go.
Thank you.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.674
All right, let's go!

24:03.943 --> 24:05.910
Let me think about it.
I'm just going to walk around a bit.

24:05.945 --> 24:06.811
Thank you.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.379
- Whoa!
- Hey, is that...

24:10.050 --> 24:11.949
Nate?

24:11.985 --> 24:13.618
Fiona!

24:13.653 --> 24:14.886
I knew it.
You know what?

24:14.921 --> 24:18.322
He must have called my office,
and he followed us up here.

24:18.358 --> 24:21.325
- I knew he would change his mind.
- That is so romantic!

24:21.361 --> 24:22.361
Nate!

24:22.429 --> 24:23.429
Nathaniel!

24:24.531 --> 24:25.963
- Hi.
- Fiona?

24:26.032 --> 24:28.232
Hey!
What are you doing here?

24:28.268 --> 24:29.828
Well, I could ask
the same thing of you.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.581
This place is so much fun,
isn't it, Nate?

24:32.605 --> 24:33.905
Yeah.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.109
I'm just so surprised
to see you here.

24:38.178 --> 24:40.311
Nate, honey, what's up?

24:40.346 --> 24:42.513
Well, I just, um...

24:42.582 --> 24:44.215
I ran into an old friend.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.251
That's one way of putting it.

24:47.287 --> 24:48.352
What's going on?

24:48.388 --> 24:52.623
Well, this is Haley...
My... My new girlfriend.

24:59.099 --> 25:02.433
I'm sorry, I just...
It's so funny.

25:02.469 --> 25:03.909
I thought
you just said "girlfriend"!

25:04.104 --> 25:04.936
He did.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.238
Wow, that was...

25:07.307 --> 25:09.574
That was fast.
How did you two meet?

25:09.609 --> 25:11.342
Actually, she's
a friend of my sister's.

25:11.377 --> 25:12.777
Haley!

25:12.812 --> 25:14.145
Haley Summit, it is you!

25:14.180 --> 25:15.880
Hi, Mrs. Rangely.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.281
You two know each other?

25:17.317 --> 25:19.984
Haley's family's been
coming to the Inn for years,

25:20.019 --> 25:21.363
and I have
your family's reservation

25:21.387 --> 25:22.720
for this evening.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.066
Your two favorite rooms,
as usual.

25:24.090 --> 25:27.125
It's not for my family.
It's for my boyfriend and I.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.862
I always loved coming
to Maplefaire growing up,

25:30.897 --> 25:32.377
and I wanted to show
Natey my Vermont.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.199
"Natey?"

25:35.368 --> 25:37.101
Hi, Mrs. Rangely.

25:38.138 --> 25:39.337
Oh my.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.905
Wait, are you staying
at the Inn?

25:40.940 --> 25:42.540
What am I missing here?

25:42.575 --> 25:46.477
It's a really small world
that just got a whole lot smaller.

25:46.513 --> 25:47.812
I'm Fiona.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.180
Hi, Fiona.

25:50.083 --> 25:51.349
Yeah.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.351
Hey.

25:53.386 --> 25:54.997
Tick-tock.
I've got to get dinner started.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.521
One sec.

25:56.589 --> 25:59.223
This is the last place on earth
I expected you to be.

25:59.259 --> 26:01.893
- At her dad's?
- Away from the city.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.794
Look, I had no idea
it was your dad's place.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.696
We could stay at another Inn.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.565
It's Maplefaire.

26:07.600 --> 26:11.068
I doubt there's any vacancies
between here and Montpelier.

26:11.104 --> 26:12.436
I'm so sorry, Fiona.

26:12.505 --> 26:13.649
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.339
It's fine!

26:15.375 --> 26:16.307
Really?

26:16.342 --> 26:19.777
Yeah, it's totally fine,
because I am actually...

26:19.812 --> 26:21.379
I'm, I'm...

26:21.414 --> 26:23.714
I'm also actually
seeing someone new.

26:23.750 --> 26:24.649
You are?

26:24.684 --> 26:25.616
Yeah.

26:25.652 --> 26:30.221
Yeah, you know, he's... Well,
he's the executive chef at the Inn...

26:31.958 --> 26:34.358
And he's just a great guy.

26:34.394 --> 26:35.493
You guys would love him.

26:35.528 --> 26:37.862
He's just...
He's really talented.

26:37.931 --> 26:41.933
Hey! Come on!
Who scratched my crepe pan?

26:43.369 --> 26:46.971
He's a little temperamental, but you
know what, that comes with being a genius.

26:47.006 --> 26:50.942
He sources everything locally.
Can you believe that?

26:50.977 --> 26:52.376
Well, I mean...

26:52.412 --> 26:53.652
Everything except me, of course.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.488
I don't get it.

27:04.524 --> 27:05.756
I mean, what were you thinking?

27:05.792 --> 27:07.058
I wasn't, okay?

27:07.093 --> 27:08.571
I mean, I clearly have
maple syrup on the brain,

27:08.595 --> 27:10.494
but I have the perfect
fix for all this.

27:10.530 --> 27:11.862
We leave!

27:11.898 --> 27:13.864
I mean, you're welcome to stay
if you want,

27:13.933 --> 27:16.901
but, you know, the universe is clearly
telling me Vermont and I do not mix.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.236
Fi...

27:18.271 --> 27:19.403
Don't you see?

27:19.439 --> 27:22.351
If you leave now, it's going
to look like you still care.

27:22.375 --> 27:26.143
I know, but...
I just, I can't do this.

27:26.179 --> 27:29.058
Look, it's just one night until Delia
finds someplace else for them to stay.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.548
Yeah, that's one night too many,

27:30.583 --> 27:33.451
so if you're coming with me,
I'll meet you by the car.

27:42.895 --> 27:43.995
You going somewhere?

27:44.030 --> 27:45.696
No, why would you think that?

27:47.133 --> 27:50.234
So listen,
I'm sorry about all this.

27:50.270 --> 27:51.380
It's just going to be
for one night.

27:51.404 --> 27:53.738
Yeah, please...
It's, it's fine.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.172
It's whatever.
It's...

27:56.209 --> 27:58.670
I mean...
You sure did meet Haley fast.

27:59.612 --> 28:00.745
Yeah, yeah.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.608
The timing
just sort of worked out.

28:05.318 --> 28:07.184
You too with that chef?

28:07.253 --> 28:11.389
Yeah, Derek.
Derek and... Yeah, that was...

28:11.424 --> 28:12.356
Same with me, I mean,
that was...

28:12.392 --> 28:13.891
That was just a lightning bolt!

28:13.926 --> 28:16.494
Great.
That... that is great.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.296
Yeah.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.867
Anyways, you know,
it's really good to see you.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.505
I, um...

28:29.175 --> 28:31.876
I've got to meet Haley down
at the lake, so I'll just...

28:31.911 --> 28:33.544
I'll just see you around.

28:33.579 --> 28:34.912
Yeah.

28:40.386 --> 28:41.786
Fiona?

28:45.391 --> 28:46.391
A word?

28:47.694 --> 28:49.160
Yeah.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.897
So...

28:52.932 --> 28:56.634
- I hear we're an item.
- You overheard that.

28:56.669 --> 28:58.035
Okay, listen, I am so sorry.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.036
It just slipped out,

28:59.105 --> 29:01.684
but Nate and I, we just broke
up, like, a few weeks ago,

29:01.708 --> 29:02.873
and he's already...

29:02.909 --> 29:04.320
He already has
a new girlfriend up here.

29:04.344 --> 29:06.243
A few weeks?

29:06.312 --> 29:08.779
Well, 23 days
and seven hours... ish.

29:08.815 --> 29:11.716
Pretty quick for a rebound.
Not much of a gentleman.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.951
You know what, though?
I think we just had a moment.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.788
- A moment of delusion?
- No, no, a moment of spark.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.892
I need your help.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.339
Pretend to be my
boyfriend for the week.

29:23.363 --> 29:25.029
Let me think about that.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.564
No.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.132
Well, what if...

29:28.167 --> 29:30.634
Just please let me save
a little dignity here.

29:30.670 --> 29:33.938
No, I've got Maplefaire this week,
and the food bloggers are coming,

29:33.973 --> 29:37.375
and even if I was as delusional
as you are, which I'm not,

29:37.410 --> 29:38.709
there's nothing in it for me.

29:38.745 --> 29:40.044
Well...

29:40.113 --> 29:43.447
How about a quid pro quo?

29:43.483 --> 29:45.683
You, you want that field
for your organic farm, right?

29:45.718 --> 29:46.718
Of course.

29:46.753 --> 29:49.653
I'd have vegetables farm to table
in minutes instead of days.

29:49.689 --> 29:51.422
It'd be a dream,
but a pipe dream.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.258
Chauncey'll never go for it.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.071
Your dream is farm to table?
I can get that for you.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.228
Not likely.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.530
See, Chauncey
is a classic New Englander.

29:59.565 --> 30:00.965
He hates change

30:01.000 --> 30:02.511
and the city people he thinks
this Inn is attracting.

30:02.535 --> 30:05.202
He's just positioning himself
for a better offer.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.537
No, no, no.

30:06.572 --> 30:10.007
Look, up here, money isn't
always the deciding factor.

30:10.042 --> 30:13.611
Chauncey isn't some Wall Street
type buying up co-ops in soho.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.713
Okay, listen.

30:15.748 --> 30:17.188
I have sold a closet
with no windows.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.183
I bought a Tribeca loft
for a song.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.763
You want that field?
I'll get it for you.

30:20.787 --> 30:22.186
Impossible.

30:22.221 --> 30:25.122
- Not in my vocabulary.
- You're serious.

30:25.158 --> 30:26.390
- Yeah.
- For the field?

30:26.426 --> 30:27.426
Yep.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.411
Well, I guess you've got yourself
a pretend boyfriend for the week.

30:51.784 --> 30:54.418
Good morning, kiddo.
You look nice.

30:54.454 --> 30:55.319
Thanks, dad.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.255
Listen. I've been
on the phone all morning.

30:58.291 --> 31:01.559
Every hotel, motel,
Inn in the county...

31:01.594 --> 31:03.961
Everybody's booked solid.
I'm sorry, honey.

31:03.996 --> 31:09.100
Look, if you want me to ask
Haley and Nate to leave, I will.

31:09.135 --> 31:10.367
It's fine, it's fine.

31:10.403 --> 31:12.303
It's fine.
That's what I figured, yeah.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.371
Listen, has Nate been down yet?

31:14.440 --> 31:16.674
Yeah, he and Haley went out
for a morning walk in the woods.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.375
- Why?
- No reason.

31:18.411 --> 31:21.512
- So... you're okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.646
Okay.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.954
You missed breakfast, but
there's still some brioche left.

31:30.022 --> 31:30.855
Never mind that.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.857
They're on a romantic stroll,
which means we are too.

31:32.892 --> 31:34.036
- But the dishes...
- They can wait!

31:34.060 --> 31:37.161
- Meet me outside in five minutes.
- Yes, dear.

31:42.235 --> 31:44.870
I thought this was supposed to be
a romantic stroll, not a sprint.

31:44.904 --> 31:47.382
Yeah, but at this pace, they'll be
back before we've even started.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.672
Those shoes.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.908
- What's wrong with my duck boots?
- Where do I even start?

31:50.943 --> 31:51.909
Hey, this is Vermont.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.844
You know, I've got a pair for you
if you want them.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.145
No thanks.

31:55.181 --> 31:56.592
I'm trying to win him back,
not scare him away.

31:56.616 --> 31:57.656
You're going to regret it.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.251
For crying
out loud... Here.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.952
No, no... Aah!
What are you doing?

32:02.021 --> 32:03.131
- Put me down.
- Quit wiggling.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.088
You're going to put
us both in the mud.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.156
- Put me down!
- Okay.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.626
I didn't mean
put me down right here!

32:08.661 --> 32:09.927
What did you want me to do?

32:09.962 --> 32:12.297
- You having some trouble there?
- No!

32:12.365 --> 32:16.300
No, no, no, no, no, we're fine.
Hi!

32:16.335 --> 32:18.769
We were just out for a walk.

32:18.804 --> 32:20.137
We haven't formally met.

32:20.172 --> 32:23.274
Sorry, sorry.
Nate, Haley, this is Derek.

32:25.545 --> 32:27.511
That's...
Quite the grip you got there.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.783
You two are so cute together.
How'd you two meet?

32:33.085 --> 32:34.385
We...

32:34.420 --> 32:38.522
I was up visiting the Inn,
and we sort of...

32:38.591 --> 32:41.659
- Just bumped into each other.
- Literally.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.727
City drivers, right?
Always speeding.

32:43.763 --> 32:47.197
Yeah, well, I mean, he was driving
dangerously under the speed limit.

32:47.233 --> 32:50.267
Well, you know how hard it is
to get Fiona to slow down.

32:50.303 --> 32:51.713
Well, maybe
I don't need to slow down.

32:51.737 --> 32:52.777
Maybe you need to speed up.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.141
And it just came together
in a Fender-bender of love.

32:58.644 --> 33:02.446
Well, we're off for a nice,
relaxing walk in the woods.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.882
Isn't that right, Fiona?
She loves to slow down now.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.717
Isn't that right, honey?

33:06.752 --> 33:08.852
- Yeah, I really do.
- Yeah, take it slow.

33:08.888 --> 33:11.255
Okay, well...

33:11.290 --> 33:12.935
Maybe we'll see you
at the Maplefaire, then.

33:12.959 --> 33:13.959
Yeah.

33:14.794 --> 33:15.794
Nice to meet you.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.361
- You too.
- Bye.

33:18.798 --> 33:20.765
- What are you doing?
- I thought that was good.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.466
No, it was a little too much.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.934
Here, you want a hand?

33:23.970 --> 33:25.610
No, thank you.
You've been helpful enough.

33:26.772 --> 33:27.772
Thanks for the help.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.107
Where's Derek?

33:31.310 --> 33:33.611
The kitchen's a mess.
That's so unlike him.

33:33.646 --> 33:36.714
I believe that he's out
on a stroll with Fiona.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.482
What? Why?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.618
Because they're
dating now, dear.

33:40.653 --> 33:42.853
Mock dating.

33:45.524 --> 33:48.692
Well... thank you.
I will see you later.

33:48.728 --> 33:50.168
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, that's it?

33:50.997 --> 33:53.575
Well, yeah. I've got contracts
to look at this morning.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.599
Well, you don't want to seem like
you're hiding out away from Nate.

33:55.635 --> 33:57.568
- No, of course not.
- Good.

33:57.603 --> 34:00.205
Everybody in town is going to
Maplefaire today, including us.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.708
I guess I'm just going to enjoy
myself on this trip, or die trying.

34:04.744 --> 34:05.744
Let's go.

34:06.946 --> 34:08.045
Angela, Brandon!

34:08.080 --> 34:10.094
We are going to go to Maplefaire.
Do you guys want to join us?

34:11.484 --> 34:12.516
Yeah, sure.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.097
- Yeah, I'll grab my coat.
- Yeah, I'll go get my stuff.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.453
Wait!

34:16.522 --> 34:19.590
- What is going on here?
- Spring is in the air.

34:24.697 --> 34:26.797
I love the smell
of maple syrup in the morning.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.234
So, you grew up in Manhattan?

34:30.268 --> 34:32.670
Let me guess...
Hell's kitchen?

34:32.705 --> 34:37.174
No, upper West Side near the park.
More like hell's breakfast nook.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.409
Chauncey.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.811
Hi. Hi, sir.

34:42.882 --> 34:44.982
That man is allergic to hellos.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.428
Just don't forget
our end of the bargain.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.985
I know, I know.

34:50.723 --> 34:52.188
Ex-boyfriend sighting,
one o'clock.

34:53.525 --> 34:54.891
They're having a candied apple?

34:56.962 --> 34:58.796
Well, two can play that game.

35:05.705 --> 35:07.049
You sure do know
how to spoil a girl.

35:07.073 --> 35:08.972
What kind of fake boyfriend
do you take me for?

35:09.909 --> 35:11.175
Okay, so...

35:11.210 --> 35:16.480
We've got pickled jalapenos,
capers, and peppers, or...

35:16.515 --> 35:18.449
You could do some apple bobbing.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.417
How about a little country
karaoke right up there?

35:20.453 --> 35:22.786
You must really enjoy putting me
in awkward situations.

35:22.822 --> 35:24.662
Yeah. It's part of the fun
of this whole thing.

35:26.926 --> 35:28.158
Did you see that?

35:28.194 --> 35:29.626
What?

35:29.662 --> 35:31.606
Nate just peeked over at us.
That is called a "tell".

35:31.630 --> 35:33.464
It's when a buyer takes
that one last look

35:33.532 --> 35:34.732
back at the house...

35:34.767 --> 35:36.166
You know
you've nearly hooked 'em.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.835
All right,
then we need to up our stakes.

35:37.870 --> 35:38.702
You want
to make him jealous, right?

35:38.771 --> 35:40.471
Yeah, of course.

35:40.506 --> 35:44.074
Then we need to look like we're
having more fun than they are.

35:46.278 --> 35:48.045
That's such a good point.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.157
All right, we've got
to do something else.

35:49.181 --> 35:51.081
We'll save it for
after, take a break.

35:52.084 --> 35:55.233
I know!
I hope you brought your appetite.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.823
Let's do this thing.
You know, French crepes,

35:59.859 --> 36:04.161
Indian dosas, Ethiopian injera,
even blinis in Russia,

36:04.230 --> 36:07.112
they all fall under
the same delightful banner...

36:07.147 --> 36:08.232
Pancakes.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.747
Save your mouth
for eating, honey.

36:11.003 --> 36:14.204
I'm mayor Sloane,
and I'd like to welcome you all.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.206
Okay, maple lovers...

36:16.242 --> 36:19.543
You each got
a plate of 11 pancakes

36:19.578 --> 36:21.445
topped
with the finest Vermont syrup.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.381
Whoever can eat the most
in 60 seconds

36:24.416 --> 36:29.186
will be crowned
our pancake king or queen!

36:29.221 --> 36:30.621
No.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.589
Ready, steady... Eat!

36:42.535 --> 36:45.135
Go, go, go, go!

36:45.171 --> 36:47.070
Go!

36:47.106 --> 36:49.406
- What are you doing?
- I'm eating!

36:49.441 --> 36:50.974
At the pace of a field mouse?

36:51.010 --> 36:54.978
Food is meant to be savored,
not endured.

36:55.014 --> 36:55.946
Stop rushing me.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.748
- It's a contest!
- I can't do this.

36:57.783 --> 37:00.017
Maybe with a little more syrup.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.251
Are you kidding me?
Budge out.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.153
Scoot over.
Watch out.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.769
Disqualified from
a pancake-eating competition?

37:18.804 --> 37:20.037
Oh, you're blaming me, huh?

37:20.072 --> 37:21.483
You were the one
who stole my pancakes.

37:21.507 --> 37:22.639
What choice did you leave me?

37:22.675 --> 37:25.008
We just obviously have different
approaches to problem-solving.

37:25.044 --> 37:27.556
Yeah, you're "left brain", as in you
left your brain at cooking school,

37:27.580 --> 37:30.347
and I'm "right brain"
'cause you know I'm right!

37:30.382 --> 37:31.181
Oh no, they're staring at us!

37:31.217 --> 37:32.217
So?

37:32.251 --> 37:33.261
So we can't be seen arguing.

37:33.285 --> 37:34.852
Do something, please.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.555
What are you doing?

37:38.591 --> 37:39.723
I panicked!

37:39.758 --> 37:41.358
Let's... let's go.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.326
I should just give up

37:42.361 --> 37:44.061
and go back to New York.

37:44.129 --> 37:45.028
You still owe me
that field, remember?

37:45.097 --> 37:47.097
Yes, how could
I possibly forget...

37:47.132 --> 37:49.200
And I will get it for you,
the sooner, the better.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.502
You even kiss too fast.

37:53.706 --> 37:55.172
Mr. Chauncey.

37:55.207 --> 37:58.709
Hi, I'm Fiona.
Here's my card.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.078
That's a really great cow
you have there.

38:01.113 --> 38:04.481
- It's a steer, actually.
- Well, it's an amazing one.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.684
Flattery will get you nowhere...

38:07.753 --> 38:10.854
And I know who you are.
Your father runs the Inn.

38:10.890 --> 38:12.522
Yeah, we're neighbors!

38:12.558 --> 38:14.035
I was hoping we could talk
neighbor-to-neighbor

38:14.059 --> 38:14.958
about your property for sale?

38:14.994 --> 38:18.206
- What's your interest in it?
- I'm actually inquiring for Derek.

38:18.230 --> 38:21.565
Ho, he's bringing in
the big New York guns, is he?

38:21.600 --> 38:25.402
Well, I don't know about that,
but he's offered you a really fair price.

38:25.471 --> 38:28.405
Well, you can tell that fella
that I am still selling to him,

38:28.440 --> 38:30.874
not now, not ever,
and that's that.

38:30.910 --> 38:33.744
But... sir,
maybe we could...

38:46.859 --> 38:48.659
Well, that morning
could have gone better.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.928
Yeah, that much we agree on.

38:50.963 --> 38:51.895
You ever slow down?

38:51.931 --> 38:52.931
Do you ever speed up?

38:52.965 --> 38:55.699
You know, a lot of good things
can come from slowing down.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.334
Name one.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.169
Art, for one.
The Russian novelists.

38:59.204 --> 39:02.940
All they needed
was a pen and a long winter.

39:02.975 --> 39:04.586
Why do you feel the need
to constantly distract yourself?

39:04.610 --> 39:06.476
No, no, no.
Just give me one second.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.659
- What are we doing here?
- I want to show you something.

39:10.683 --> 39:11.581
No, no, no.

39:11.617 --> 39:12.783
Come on.

39:12.818 --> 39:14.029
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

39:14.053 --> 39:15.485
Just taking a little field trip.

39:15.521 --> 39:19.022
No, no, after our last walk, I think
I just need a hot bath and a book.

39:19.058 --> 39:21.291
I promise it's going to be
worth it this time,

39:21.327 --> 39:22.993
but you may want to wear these.

39:25.898 --> 39:27.397
Fine.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.266
Almost there.

39:29.301 --> 39:30.600
Almost where?

39:30.636 --> 39:32.302
We're going tree-tapping.

39:32.338 --> 39:34.805
The first syrup of the season's
always the sweetest.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.373
Why are you bring me
along for this?

39:36.408 --> 39:37.574
To make a point.

39:37.643 --> 39:38.963
Can't you just
tell me your point?

39:41.347 --> 39:44.448
There she is.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.782
Beauty?

39:45.851 --> 39:47.818
What's so special
about this tree?

39:47.853 --> 39:51.088
My great-grandfather planted
this tree when he was a boy

39:51.123 --> 39:51.955
among these evergreens.

39:51.991 --> 39:53.390
Come on, really?

39:53.425 --> 39:54.558
Yep...

39:54.593 --> 39:58.228
And then, when it grew,
my grandma helped him tap it,

39:58.263 --> 40:00.531
and then my parents,
and now me.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.235
Well, it is really
pretty out here.

40:05.270 --> 40:06.910
And you haven't even tasted
the syrup yet.

40:07.773 --> 40:08.872
This tree is special.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.475
It's got the lightest...

40:11.510 --> 40:13.310
The most golden...

40:13.345 --> 40:17.948
See, a tree like this, it takes
years and years to grow.

40:21.987 --> 40:22.987
And we hold it still.

40:23.022 --> 40:24.502
Don't worry,
I'm not going to hurt it.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.190
Tap it in.

40:30.629 --> 40:32.662
Where's the syrup?

40:32.698 --> 40:34.709
I think our tree is broken.
Do we have a broken tree?

40:34.733 --> 40:37.034
It's not a syrup faucet.

40:37.069 --> 40:38.568
See, that's my point.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.849
A bucket like this, it could take
a couple days to fill.

40:40.873 --> 40:44.841
My point is,
is that good things...

40:44.910 --> 40:45.910
Are worth waiting for.

40:51.316 --> 40:52.449
Sweet?

40:53.552 --> 40:54.684
It's not bad.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.486
Yeah, we haven't even
boiled it down yet.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.355
You really do love it out here?

40:59.358 --> 41:00.424
Yeah.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.326
I love being part
of a tradition.

41:03.362 --> 41:05.429
Like my recipes.

41:05.464 --> 41:07.297
A lot of those are
handed down generations.

41:07.332 --> 41:10.067
Some people keep photo albums.

41:10.102 --> 41:11.968
I have this cookbook
I keep by the stove.

41:12.004 --> 41:13.470
It's full of recipes...

41:13.505 --> 41:15.672
And then, when I make
something my grandma made,

41:15.741 --> 41:17.707
it helps me remember her.

41:17.743 --> 41:20.844
It's like she's almost there.
Does that make any sense?

41:20.879 --> 41:22.479
Yeah, I...

41:22.514 --> 41:26.283
Yeah, I get
the remembering part, but...

41:26.318 --> 41:28.530
I don't know, for me, sometimes,
remembering can be hard.

41:28.554 --> 41:30.220
What do you mean?

41:31.857 --> 41:34.391
Let's just say
some memories are like syrup...

41:34.460 --> 41:37.127
- They stick.
- But hopefully sweet?

41:39.898 --> 41:41.098
All right.

41:42.568 --> 41:43.568
Say goodbye.

41:44.870 --> 41:45.870
Goodbye, tree.

41:50.142 --> 41:53.009
Listen, I think maybe we
got off on the wrong foot.

41:54.046 --> 41:55.011
Look, I'm sorry.

41:55.047 --> 41:57.948
It's just between my career
and some issues with my dad,

41:57.983 --> 41:59.649
and then this whole
thing with Nate,

41:59.718 --> 42:01.918
it's just... I've been
under a lot of stress, and...

42:01.954 --> 42:04.554
I get it. I do.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.923
If you don't mind me asking,
why'd you and Nate break up?

42:08.460 --> 42:12.729
Something about being tired
of trying to fit into my juggling act.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.164
I thought so.

42:15.634 --> 42:20.137
You know, if you really want
to get Nate's attention, just...

42:20.172 --> 42:22.839
Slow down.
Smell the maple syrup.

42:24.343 --> 42:26.103
Okay, maybe don't ever say that
again, but...

42:28.747 --> 42:31.248
You know what?
I have just the event for that.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.593
And what brings us here?

42:43.662 --> 42:44.828
All in good time.

42:47.833 --> 42:49.933
So what is this about?

42:49.968 --> 42:51.568
We're maple syrup tasting.

42:51.603 --> 42:53.403
It's like wine-tasting,
but with syrup.

42:53.438 --> 42:55.450
What, is this payback
for the pancake competition?

42:55.474 --> 42:57.440
That's right.

42:57.476 --> 42:59.443
Incoming, incoming.
Stay in character.

43:04.349 --> 43:05.515
We meet again.

43:07.286 --> 43:08.985
So what have you two
been up to today?

43:09.021 --> 43:13.089
Well, we went to a yoga class,
we tried out snowshoeing,

43:13.125 --> 43:16.092
and then we hit
this great little antique shop.

43:16.161 --> 43:17.460
What about you guys?

43:20.032 --> 43:25.001
Well, we had a really busy
morning planned, and then we...

43:25.037 --> 43:28.805
Just ended up talking
for hours and hours.

43:28.840 --> 43:29.840
Yeah, just hours.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.175
Hours.

43:32.244 --> 43:34.411
Well, I thought
Nate had to try this.

43:34.446 --> 43:37.747
The syrup tasting was always one
of my favorite events growing up.

43:37.816 --> 43:42.118
My wine-tasting palate
is first-rate, but... syrup?

43:42.154 --> 43:43.386
I think I'll sit this one out.

43:43.422 --> 43:46.056
Aww, come on,
what are you afraid of?

43:46.091 --> 43:47.057
It'll be a blast.

43:47.092 --> 43:48.458
Actually...

43:48.493 --> 43:49.459
Haley...

43:49.494 --> 43:50.494
It's on.

43:50.529 --> 43:51.461
All right.

43:51.496 --> 43:52.295
Great.

43:52.331 --> 43:53.331
Have fun.

44:02.941 --> 44:05.742
Yoga?
He doesn't do yoga.

44:05.777 --> 44:07.043
She is really pretty, though.

44:09.014 --> 44:09.879
Okay, folks!

44:09.948 --> 44:11.348
She's okay.

44:11.383 --> 44:13.783
You each have
five samples in front of you.

44:13.819 --> 44:18.255
As you try each one, fill out
your card with your guess,

44:18.323 --> 44:23.793
and then we'll really see
who knows their syrup.

44:23.829 --> 44:25.128
Okay, drink up.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.863
Are you serious?
Come on.

44:26.898 --> 44:28.710
You want me to find the perfect
brownstone in Brooklyn,

44:28.734 --> 44:30.800
I'm your girl, but this?

44:30.836 --> 44:33.437
- It's just like wine tasting.
- It's maple syrup.

44:35.307 --> 44:37.574
Yeah, but what we call "maple"
is a combination

44:37.609 --> 44:40.543
of a hundred different sugars
and amino acids.

44:40.579 --> 44:42.779
They all combine differently,
depending

44:42.814 --> 44:44.814
on how that particular tree
woke up from winter.

44:44.850 --> 44:47.595
Okay, so, Mr. Tree man, you're
the expert, you do the tasting.

44:47.619 --> 44:48.785
Close your eyes.

44:48.854 --> 44:51.354
I don't want to close my eyes,
so I can see what they're doing.

44:51.390 --> 44:52.656
Yeah, that's a, that's a...

44:52.691 --> 44:53.990
Forget about Nate for a second,

44:54.026 --> 44:57.027
and just clear your mind
for once in your life.

44:59.398 --> 45:00.530
Is your mind clear?

45:00.565 --> 45:02.232
No, because you're still talking
to me.

45:02.301 --> 45:03.533
All right, shut your eyes.

45:03.602 --> 45:05.502
All right, now,
give me your hand.

45:05.570 --> 45:08.371
What would you do
if this was wine?

45:08.407 --> 45:11.141
Um, if this were wine,
I would drink it.

45:11.176 --> 45:14.277
If this was wine,
I would swirl it around.

45:14.313 --> 45:15.313
That's right.

45:16.315 --> 45:17.781
Check for unique tones.

45:18.884 --> 45:20.550
Yeah, it seems smooth and...

45:24.156 --> 45:25.622
Kind of a hint of vanilla.

45:25.657 --> 45:27.724
Yeah, exactly.

45:27.759 --> 45:29.070
Depending
on how the sap is heated,

45:29.094 --> 45:31.528
it can bring out
different vanillin in the flavor.

45:31.563 --> 45:32.962
Okay.

45:32.998 --> 45:34.342
What about this one?
What about the color of it?

45:34.366 --> 45:35.498
Try this one.

45:37.569 --> 45:38.569
I'm counting on you here.

45:38.603 --> 45:41.705
And I think
I remember you saying

45:41.740 --> 45:42.884
the later the season,
the darker the color?

45:42.908 --> 45:45.875
That's right.

45:45.944 --> 45:47.410
So we'll Mark it "Late Season".

45:47.446 --> 45:48.756
You know, you're better at this
than you thought.

45:48.780 --> 45:49.780
Thanks.

45:51.583 --> 45:53.850
And I would call that a "tell".

45:55.787 --> 45:56.787
Try this one.

45:59.558 --> 46:00.590
Okay, number three.

46:05.230 --> 46:05.962
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

46:05.997 --> 46:07.530
Not bad for a newcomer!

46:07.599 --> 46:08.498
Thanks!

46:08.567 --> 46:11.245
And don't forget your prize, two
tickets to Tuesday's maple dance!

46:11.269 --> 46:12.168
Great!

46:12.204 --> 46:14.704
I cannot believe we won.
Five for five!

46:16.108 --> 46:18.843
- Hey, no hard feelings, Nate?
- No, not at all.

46:20.412 --> 46:21.756
Well, we'll see you guys
back at the Inn.

46:21.780 --> 46:23.980
We're off for a sunset stroll.

46:24.015 --> 46:26.216
Great.

46:27.919 --> 46:29.419
A sunset stroll?

46:29.454 --> 46:31.121
Okay, someone's
getting competitive.

46:31.156 --> 46:32.555
See, what did I tell you?

46:32.591 --> 46:34.691
I'd say he's intrigued
by Vermont Fiona.

46:34.726 --> 46:35.892
I think we're making progress.

46:38.630 --> 46:39.941
Hey, you want to make
him jealous, right?

46:39.965 --> 46:41.464
Yes, seething.

46:41.533 --> 46:43.400
I'm training a new sous chef
on tonight's dinner.

46:43.435 --> 46:47.303
Would Vermont Fiona like
to join me for a dinner for two?

46:47.339 --> 46:49.172
Vermont Fiona would love that.

46:49.241 --> 46:50.974
There is one thing
I have to do first, though.

46:51.009 --> 46:52.009
Okay.

46:53.044 --> 46:55.011
Mr. Chauncey.

46:55.046 --> 46:56.880
Hi.

46:56.915 --> 46:57.814
Well...

46:57.849 --> 47:00.417
If good fences mean good neighbors,
we've got a long way to go.

47:01.420 --> 47:02.819
Right.

47:02.888 --> 47:04.988
I was hoping we could talk
a little more privately.

47:05.023 --> 47:08.491
How about you get to the point?
I got hungry sheep waiting.

47:08.527 --> 47:09.492
Right.

47:09.528 --> 47:13.363
I wanted to discuss my client's
offer to buy your field.

47:13.398 --> 47:14.398
Never going to happen.

47:15.600 --> 47:19.636
But you're growing weeds,
and I've asked around town,

47:19.671 --> 47:22.071
and this has been sitting here
for a while on the market.

47:22.107 --> 47:24.407
It's a solid offer.
Why not sell to Derek?

47:24.443 --> 47:28.244
'Cause he's attracting the wrong
element with his fancy cooking...

47:28.313 --> 47:30.313
Turnip tartines,
or whatever they are.

47:30.348 --> 47:34.262
You and your type are changing this
valley, and it's not for the better.

47:34.286 --> 47:35.385
Me?

47:35.420 --> 47:37.420
Sir, you have me pegged
all wrong.

47:39.524 --> 47:42.459
Your fancy scarf
is snagged on the fence there.

47:54.973 --> 47:57.207
- You look beautiful, honey!
- Thanks, dad.

47:58.510 --> 48:01.978
So, tell me, what is this
charade with you and Derek?

48:02.013 --> 48:04.447
Are there no secrets
in the State of Vermont?

48:04.483 --> 48:07.584
Come on, if it impacts the Inn,
it's my business.

48:07.619 --> 48:10.286
We've got those food bloggers
coming in a couple of days,

48:10.322 --> 48:12.589
and Derek has to be focused.

48:12.624 --> 48:14.791
The future of the Inn
could be at stake here.

48:14.826 --> 48:16.192
I know, of course.
The Inn.

48:17.696 --> 48:21.342
All right, look, I've got a raccoon
situation down at the carriage house,

48:21.366 --> 48:22.366
so...

48:23.134 --> 48:24.334
Hey, Fi.

48:24.402 --> 48:25.869
You ready to eat?

48:25.904 --> 48:27.624
Yeah, you know, dad,
do you want to join us?

48:29.708 --> 48:32.509
No, that's okay. You lovely
ladies have a nice dinner.

48:34.913 --> 48:37.747
- What was that all about?
- It's ancient history.

48:37.782 --> 48:40.416
You and your dad really need
to have a heart-to-heart.

48:40.485 --> 48:42.118
You think I haven't tried?

48:42.153 --> 48:44.687
He has this amazing gift
for changing the subject.

48:44.756 --> 48:46.656
Speaking of...

48:46.725 --> 48:47.790
How was your day?

48:47.859 --> 48:49.192
It was great.

48:49.227 --> 48:50.338
Your father had Brandon and I

48:50.362 --> 48:53.329
handing out flyers for the
bloggers' dinner all over town.

48:53.365 --> 48:54.631
Wait, he put you to work?

48:54.666 --> 48:56.277
Angela, you're supposed
to be on vacation!

48:56.301 --> 48:57.467
I'm sorry.

48:57.536 --> 48:58.568
I'll have a word with him.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.570
No, don't you dare.
It was fun.

49:01.506 --> 49:02.705
Ladies!

49:02.741 --> 49:04.875
There's been a slight change
in the seating plan for tonight.

49:04.943 --> 49:07.310
Angela, you're going to be
right over here by the fireplace.

49:07.379 --> 49:09.546
I like this.

49:09.581 --> 49:11.180
And Fiona, your date is waiting.

49:11.216 --> 49:12.015
Yes!

49:12.050 --> 49:12.982
Hello.

49:13.018 --> 49:14.018
Hello!

49:14.052 --> 49:16.953
Well, if Fiona gets to mock date,
then maybe we can as well.

49:20.425 --> 49:22.058
Voila.

49:27.966 --> 49:28.932
Good evening.

49:28.967 --> 49:29.933
Hi!

49:29.968 --> 49:32.235
No duck boots tonight?

49:32.270 --> 49:35.638
These loafers turn back
into duck boots at midnight.

49:35.674 --> 49:36.472
Fair warning,

49:36.508 --> 49:38.519
I may have to duck back
into the kitchen occasionally

49:38.543 --> 49:42.078
just to make sure my sous chef
has everything running smoothly.

49:43.715 --> 49:45.181
Did you just hear a can opener?

49:45.216 --> 49:47.450
If we're playing happy couple,

49:47.485 --> 49:49.130
you need to pay attention
to me, and not the kitchen.

49:49.154 --> 49:51.588
Okay, well, then,
you have to look at me as well.

49:51.623 --> 49:55.525
All right, well, I guess this
little fake relationship of ours

49:55.560 --> 49:56.993
can use a little give and take.

49:57.028 --> 49:59.896
Okay.
Let's just do our best.

49:59.931 --> 50:01.331
Just admit it,
you love being a chef

50:01.366 --> 50:04.101
because you get to torture
everyone with your perfectionism.

50:05.904 --> 50:06.904
Is that what you think?

50:08.073 --> 50:11.741
Look, you know...
The best dishes of my life?

50:11.776 --> 50:16.946
My grandma's wedding meatballs.
My dad's Shepherd's pie.

50:16.982 --> 50:19.782
Maple torte
on my aunt's birthday.

50:19.818 --> 50:22.285
To me,
food isn't about perfection.

50:22.354 --> 50:24.520
It's about...

50:24.556 --> 50:26.189
It's about love,

50:26.224 --> 50:27.357
and...

50:27.392 --> 50:30.893
And family, and tradition.

50:33.999 --> 50:34.999
Anyway...

50:37.168 --> 50:39.902
I'd say by the look on Nate's
face, our plan is going rather well.

50:40.939 --> 50:41.804
How are things on your end?

50:41.873 --> 50:45.008
Tracked down Chauncey today.
He is one tough nut.

50:45.043 --> 50:46.743
Yeah, tell me about it.

50:46.811 --> 50:48.144
But don't worry, I'm tougher.

50:48.179 --> 50:50.813
I actually have a little mission
planned for tomorrow.

50:50.849 --> 50:53.149
- Are you in?
- Sure.

50:53.218 --> 50:56.152
Here's to solving
all our problems.

50:56.187 --> 50:59.582
I told Robin if her brother was
going to act like that, then...

51:00.325 --> 51:01.658
Nate?

51:01.726 --> 51:02.792
Are you listening?

51:02.827 --> 51:04.727
Yeah, yeah, I just...

51:04.763 --> 51:06.029
I think it's odd

51:06.064 --> 51:07.997
that Fiona didn't bring
her cell phone to dinner.

51:08.033 --> 51:09.033
That's a first.

51:11.469 --> 51:12.802
Nate, what's come over you?

51:14.572 --> 51:15.672
What?

51:15.707 --> 51:18.675
So what's the deal
with you and your dad?

51:18.710 --> 51:22.011
That's the one answer the staff
rumor mill can't grind out.

51:23.114 --> 51:24.114
It's just...

51:25.917 --> 51:28.351
When I was 20,
my mom passed away, and...

51:28.386 --> 51:29.797
Well, my life was turned
upside down.

51:29.821 --> 51:30.987
Sorry.

51:31.022 --> 51:35.124
Hey, you think I love the city?
My mom loved it even more.

51:35.193 --> 51:38.327
She lived life at a gallop,
and, well, I take after her...

51:39.197 --> 51:40.563
And growing up,

51:40.598 --> 51:42.576
we had this amazing apartment
overlooking Central Park.

51:42.600 --> 51:46.903
It was the perfect location,
and we would...

51:46.938 --> 51:48.683
I mean, we'd open the windows
at night in the winter,

51:48.707 --> 51:51.607
and you would smell
chestnuts roasting,

51:51.643 --> 51:53.476
and you'd hear cars driving by
all night.

51:53.511 --> 51:55.278
In the summer,
mom and I would sit out there

51:55.313 --> 52:00.049
and just watch hansom cabs
trotting by, and...

52:00.085 --> 52:02.919
My dad always thought
it was so loud and busy...

52:04.322 --> 52:05.722
But mom and I loved it.

52:07.692 --> 52:08.825
Sounds great.

52:10.061 --> 52:12.361
Yeah, it really was, um...

52:12.430 --> 52:14.263
And after my mom passed away,

52:14.299 --> 52:16.766
my dad actually just...
He sold it...

52:16.801 --> 52:17.867
With no warning.

52:17.902 --> 52:20.303
Sold it, moved up here,
and, um...

52:20.338 --> 52:23.039
Just really put our past
behind him.

52:23.108 --> 52:25.682
Well, things have been a little strained
between my dad and I ever since.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.411
That explains quite a bit.

52:28.446 --> 52:33.015
You know, for you, you have
a recipe to keep a memory alive.

52:33.051 --> 52:35.985
For me, I guess...

52:36.020 --> 52:39.455
I guess it's a place.

52:39.524 --> 52:42.692
You know, the city
is my tie to our past,

52:42.727 --> 52:44.961
and... to my mom.

52:49.868 --> 52:51.734
I sound like the last soldier
of my family,

52:51.803 --> 52:54.337
just, you know, clinging
to this island of Manhattan.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.560
Well, that's a tough battle
to fight on your own.

52:58.576 --> 53:00.136
I think
they probably need you in there.

53:05.183 --> 53:07.583
You know what?

53:07.619 --> 53:08.985
I think it can wait.

53:30.942 --> 53:32.041
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

53:33.077 --> 53:34.155
You might want
to tighten those laces,

53:34.179 --> 53:37.613
'cause I hit a patch of ice
as I jogged that last turn.

53:37.649 --> 53:40.283
Thanks, but I actually think I'm
going to walk the rest of the way.

53:40.351 --> 53:41.684
You are going to walk?

53:41.719 --> 53:44.320
Yeah, sure.
Walking.

53:44.355 --> 53:46.489
What, did you sprain an ankle or
something?

53:47.792 --> 53:52.061
No, I just think I want
to take in the scenery.

53:52.096 --> 53:56.365
You know, you...
You seem different out here.

53:56.434 --> 53:57.434
Chalk it up to Vermont...

53:59.170 --> 54:01.537
But I actually have been
discovering a few things lately.

54:03.007 --> 54:04.807
Yeah, yeah, I guess you have.

54:06.177 --> 54:08.644
You know, I saw you and Derek
at dinner last night.

54:09.781 --> 54:11.091
I hope you don't mind
me asking, but...

54:11.115 --> 54:13.115
What do you two have in common?

54:15.854 --> 54:17.134
Guess I get
to discover that too.

54:18.523 --> 54:19.789
See ya.

54:25.830 --> 54:27.496
Hey!

54:27.532 --> 54:28.532
I'm here to recruit you.

54:29.334 --> 54:31.868
Fiona texted about putting some
sort of secret mission together.

54:32.904 --> 54:34.237
What is it?

54:34.272 --> 54:38.140
Who knows, but, you know,
Fiona always has a nice way

54:38.176 --> 54:39.176
of shaking things up.

54:41.412 --> 54:43.546
So, how's the whole
"moving back home" thing going?

54:43.581 --> 54:45.648
Are you enjoying living out here?

54:45.683 --> 54:46.849
Yeah...

54:46.885 --> 54:48.284
For now.

54:48.319 --> 54:50.319
I wouldn't mind getting
back into the action,

54:50.355 --> 54:53.890
but, first, I wanted to make sure
dad's Inn is a success, so...

54:56.728 --> 54:58.895
Such a nice guy.
No wonder I always liked you.

54:58.963 --> 55:01.097
You know, when we were kids,

55:01.132 --> 55:04.200
I didn't chuck my sno-cones
at just anyone.

55:04.235 --> 55:06.969
Well, I only pulled the hair
of girls that I liked.

55:08.172 --> 55:09.505
Do you want
to have a break later

55:09.540 --> 55:11.118
and we can go into town,
put up some more flyers,

55:11.142 --> 55:13.542
maybe find a place
that sells sno-cones?

55:13.578 --> 55:14.578
You're on.

55:16.581 --> 55:18.314
It's Fiona.

55:18.349 --> 55:19.649
The mission's a go.

55:19.684 --> 55:21.450
Tell me again
how I got roped into this?

55:21.486 --> 55:23.953
I had some inspiration.
You know what?

55:23.988 --> 55:25.566
I didn't get to where I am
by being timid.

55:25.590 --> 55:26.667
So what are we
doing here, anyways?

55:26.691 --> 55:29.892
We're mending fences, literally,
and apparently cow-sitting.

55:31.095 --> 55:33.629
I want to show Chauncey
we can be a good neighbor.

55:33.665 --> 55:35.631
So he's ploughing his
south field right now,

55:35.700 --> 55:37.333
so we probably
have a couple hours.

55:37.368 --> 55:39.368
Looks like we've got
our work cut out for us.

55:39.404 --> 55:41.771
All right, let's get started.

56:33.992 --> 56:35.024
Steady down there.

56:38.629 --> 56:41.397
Not bad.

56:41.466 --> 56:44.967
What's that noise?
A tractor?

56:45.003 --> 56:47.403
He's coming!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

56:47.438 --> 56:49.338
Bye, Bessie!

56:52.744 --> 56:54.343
Thanks!

56:54.379 --> 56:57.313
I just wish I could see the look on
Chauncey's face when he sees our work.

56:57.382 --> 56:59.415
Got to hand it to you, you know
how to think outside the box.

56:59.450 --> 57:00.750
You have to.

57:00.785 --> 57:02.985
I mean, you have to
to succeed in my business.

57:04.455 --> 57:06.355
Haven't you ever wanted
more for yourself?

57:06.424 --> 57:10.292
I mean, a chef of your talent
would just be in such high demand

57:10.361 --> 57:11.861
in New York.

57:11.896 --> 57:13.863
Nah, I got everything
I need right here.

57:13.898 --> 57:15.931
Really, so you're
content with all this?

57:15.967 --> 57:17.666
Just small town life forever?

57:20.104 --> 57:22.872
When I was growing up,
I couldn't wait to get away,

57:22.907 --> 57:25.174
but then I went
to culinary school in Paris,

57:25.209 --> 57:26.609
and...

57:26.644 --> 57:29.745
I had this apartment
overlooking the city,

57:29.781 --> 57:33.549
French girlfriend, different
amazing restaurant every night...

57:33.584 --> 57:38.087
And then one day, I was sitting
on the banks of the Seine,

57:38.122 --> 57:41.457
and I realized that...

57:41.526 --> 57:43.025
I missed home.

57:45.129 --> 57:47.530
This place, it just...

57:47.598 --> 57:49.265
It grows on you.

57:52.103 --> 57:53.147
What have you two been up to?

57:53.171 --> 57:55.304
We're just...

57:55.339 --> 57:57.440
Doing a little work.

57:57.475 --> 57:58.774
Why are you so dressed up?

57:58.810 --> 58:00.876
It's for the dance tonight.

58:00.912 --> 58:02.244
Last night of Maplefaire
and all.

58:03.448 --> 58:06.849
Yeah, I'd better get cleaned up too,
'cause we're also going to the dance.

58:06.884 --> 58:08.150
Yeah.

58:08.186 --> 58:10.219
Right, we don't want to
waste our free tickets.

58:10.254 --> 58:12.054
But don't you have
to cover dinner?

58:12.090 --> 58:13.789
No, my sous chef can handle it.

58:13.858 --> 58:15.691
Letting go of control?
I like it.

58:15.726 --> 58:18.427
Yeah, I'd better go check on him
just to make sure.

58:18.463 --> 58:20.143
It's not a control thing,
it's just... Yeah.

58:22.100 --> 58:24.178
Well, I better go get ready,
so... We'll see you there.

58:24.202 --> 58:25.334
Yeah, yeah.

58:25.369 --> 58:26.469
Hey, Fiona...

58:26.504 --> 58:28.437
I need to talk to you.

58:30.308 --> 58:32.508
Hey, that was fast.

58:32.543 --> 58:34.376
Hey. See you later.

58:34.412 --> 58:35.511
Yeah.

58:44.155 --> 58:45.321
Honey...

58:45.356 --> 58:47.456
- Can I have a word?
- Sure. What's up, dad?

58:47.492 --> 58:48.492
Yeah, well...

58:50.428 --> 58:52.428
I just got a phone call
from Chauncey.

58:52.463 --> 58:53.996
Was he excited?

58:54.031 --> 58:56.665
Not exactly.
He was furious.

58:56.701 --> 59:00.136
You didn't by any chance
rebuild his fence?

59:00.171 --> 59:03.939
Wait, he wasn't happy?
What is wrong with this place?

59:04.008 --> 59:07.443
Honey, people up here
are proud and self-reliant.

59:07.478 --> 59:10.579
It's best
not to burn any Bridges.

59:10.615 --> 59:12.581
I was hoping that some day

59:12.617 --> 59:14.383
maybe you'd want
to spend more time up here.

59:14.418 --> 59:16.252
You do seem to be
taking to the place.

59:16.320 --> 59:19.955
Dad, don't forget that this whole
Vermont thing is just an act.

59:21.826 --> 59:25.161
Right.
I've got a plumbing thing I...

59:25.196 --> 59:26.262
Yeah.

59:32.436 --> 59:34.047
Are you and your dad
ever going to really talk?

59:34.071 --> 59:35.938
I'm not holding my breath.

59:36.007 --> 59:38.541
Well, cinderella,
you'd better hurry up.

59:38.609 --> 59:40.976
You have a dance to get to.

59:41.012 --> 59:42.012
Right.

59:45.816 --> 59:48.484
I wish I'd packed
more evening-wear options.

59:48.553 --> 59:51.620
Okay.
It's almost time.

59:51.689 --> 59:52.521
Come on out.

59:52.557 --> 59:53.557
Okay.

59:55.927 --> 59:57.126
Fiona!

59:57.161 --> 59:58.894
You look amazing.

59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.030
Really?
Are you sure?

01:00:01.933 --> 01:00:03.232
Almost ready?

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:04.833
Come and have a look
at my handwork.

01:00:07.138 --> 01:00:09.171
You're perfect. But...

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.507
But?

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:12.942
I have one slight addition
for you.

01:00:18.249 --> 01:00:19.249
It was my mother's.

01:00:21.686 --> 01:00:23.419
I know I'm not your mom,

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:25.554
and I could never
take her place, but...

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:31.560
This is really special.

01:00:31.596 --> 01:00:33.662
Just... thank you.

01:00:33.698 --> 01:00:34.863
Hey, hey!

01:00:34.899 --> 01:00:36.065
Watch the hair!

01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:38.534
Sorry!

01:00:38.603 --> 01:00:42.871
You ready? Let's go. Your fake
boyfriend will be here any minute.

01:00:42.907 --> 01:00:44.240
Right, okay.

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:13.869
Your hansom cab awaits.

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:16.372
I never expected all this.

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:20.009
The bells were the horse's idea.

01:01:21.112 --> 01:01:23.045
You have gone above and beyond.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.780
Like you said...
A deal's a deal.

01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:28.050
Well, it's not exactly Central Park,
but it's not bad.

01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:31.021
It's beautiful.

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:34.556
It's the moonlight.

01:01:34.592 --> 01:01:35.958
In Vermont.

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.236
It's so beautiful.

01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:49.638
Yeah, it's amazing what
a few twinkly lights can do.

01:01:53.244 --> 01:01:55.077
You know, if I were Nate,

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:58.414
and I walked in here
and found you dressed like this,

01:01:58.482 --> 01:01:59.848
dancing with some other guy...

01:02:01.152 --> 01:02:02.872
Well, that just might send me
over the edge.

01:02:04.322 --> 01:02:05.421
Are you asking me to dance?

01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:08.424
Well, if the duck boot fits...

01:02:10.461 --> 01:02:13.295
I'm just...
Staying in character.

01:02:13.331 --> 01:02:14.331
Is that what it is?

01:02:17.501 --> 01:02:19.535
I hope a slow song
won't be a problem.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:20.570
I think I'll manage.

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:28.877
Are you kidding me?

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:36.485
I've had it.

01:02:36.554 --> 01:02:37.619
What are you doing?

01:02:37.688 --> 01:02:38.932
You're clearly
still in love with her!

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:40.923
You want my opinion?

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:44.126
Do I have a choice?

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:45.728
Maybe Nate was just
one more thing

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.629
for you to check off
your to-do list.

01:02:49.834 --> 01:02:52.634
Do you want my opinion?

01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:56.071
You are a surprisingly
good dancer.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:03:01.210
Well, working in a kitchen
is a dance all on its own.

01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:05.647
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks.

01:03:07.718 --> 01:03:09.752
This is such a beautiful song.

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:11.186
Yeah, I love this song.

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.946
You know,
I've got to hand it to you.

01:03:37.982 --> 01:03:42.551
You're pulling off
your Vermont act surprisingly well.

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:45.821
Can I tell you a secret?

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:47.523
Maybe it's not an act.

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:53.507
You know, when I said that I
had everything I needed up here,

01:03:53.531 --> 01:03:55.697
that wasn't entirely true.

01:03:55.733 --> 01:03:57.032
What was missing?

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:01.637
- Derek?
- Mayor Sloane.

01:04:01.672 --> 01:04:02.749
There are some people
from the governor's staff

01:04:02.773 --> 01:04:03.872
that I'd love you to meet.

01:04:03.908 --> 01:04:05.240
Come on.

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:08.343
- I'm sorry, Fiona.
- It's okay.

01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:24.493
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Hi.

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:26.962
I've been wanting
to talk to you all night.

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:27.930
Okay.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:30.466
Look...

01:04:30.501 --> 01:04:34.269
I know that Derek is a nice guy
and all...

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:36.538
But, I mean, it's not serious
between you two, is it?

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:39.808
I don't know. Why?

01:04:39.844 --> 01:04:42.644
Don't you see it, Fiona?

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:46.021
We both rebounded, and we bounced
right back into each other.

01:04:47.685 --> 01:04:48.884
It's destiny.

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:53.055
- Nate, what about Haley?
- She stormed off.

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.724
She's headed back to New York.
It's over.

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:58.060
I was going to tell her
how I feel about you,

01:04:58.128 --> 01:04:59.761
but apparently,
she figured it out.

01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:03.465
Look, let's go back to the city.

01:05:03.534 --> 01:05:06.568
We'll pick up where we left off.

01:05:08.005 --> 01:05:10.305
It's always been us, Fiona...

01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:11.440
At any speed.

01:05:14.545 --> 01:05:15.944
I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:25.787
You sure are quiet tonight.

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:27.189
Just thinking.

01:05:27.224 --> 01:05:31.960
- So I guess you got Nate back.
- What do you mean?

01:05:31.996 --> 01:05:33.762
I saw you two holding hands.

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:38.133
No...
He just grabbed my hand.

01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:39.968
I'd call that a "tell".

01:05:40.004 --> 01:05:42.771
Does this mean you're
headed back to the city?

01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:45.607
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

01:05:45.643 --> 01:05:48.343
Because I haven't held up
my end of the bargain yet.

01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:51.213
I think we can consider
our deal complete.

01:05:51.282 --> 01:05:54.750
No, I haven't got you your field,
and I never break a promise.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:03.091
It's okay.
I'm letting you off the hook.

01:06:03.127 --> 01:06:04.393
What if I don't want you to?

01:06:04.428 --> 01:06:05.761
And...

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:07.829
What about what you said to me
tonight at the dance?

01:06:07.865 --> 01:06:10.966
Maybe we both got swept up
in the moment,

01:06:11.001 --> 01:06:13.079
but my feet are planted here,
and yours are in New York.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:15.337
That's just who we are, right?

01:06:15.406 --> 01:06:17.439
Of... course, but...

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.841
And you deserve everything
you've worked so hard for.

01:06:19.877 --> 01:06:22.811
Yes, young man,
I completely agree.

01:06:22.846 --> 01:06:24.947
Irwin? What are you
doing up here?

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:26.915
Okay,
I'll be the first to admit,

01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:29.585
I don't usually have to work
this hard to recruit top talent,

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:32.454
and I'm also someone who
doesn't give up so easily,

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:37.259
so I thought perhaps you and I can
discuss the terms of our contract

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:38.527
over a late dinner?

01:06:39.863 --> 01:06:41.496
I'll get something
started for you.

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:45.601
Shall we?

01:06:47.271 --> 01:06:48.271
I'm famished.

01:07:15.633 --> 01:07:17.866
Returning to the scene of the crime?

01:07:17.935 --> 01:07:20.302
- At least you didn't tear it down.
- I thought about it.

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:23.372
Darn thing's too well built.

01:07:24.842 --> 01:07:26.453
Honestly, sir, we were just
trying to do something nice.

01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:29.611
I'm really sorry, though,
if we overreached.

01:07:29.647 --> 01:07:33.515
I'm actually headed
out of town soon, but...

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:34.683
I've got to hand it to you,

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:37.186
you're on a very, very short list
of sellers who I couldn't budge.

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:38.787
That so?

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:39.822
Yeah.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:42.624
Let's just call it even.

01:07:42.693 --> 01:07:44.493
You know what?

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:47.396
There's a big dinner
at the Inn tonight. I...

01:07:48.866 --> 01:07:51.733
I'd love for you to check it out.
You could just...

01:07:51.769 --> 01:07:54.369
Tell my dad that you're
stopping by, and it's my treat.

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.274
Don't you owe it to yourself
to at least give it a try?

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:03.211
Bye, Bessie.

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:18.393
Hey, how was your run?

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:20.796
Kind of turned
into more of a walk.

01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:24.633
I sort of wanted to just look around
and, you know, have one last look

01:08:24.702 --> 01:08:27.301
before I headed back
to the city later today.

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:30.839
Is something wrong, dear?

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:35.243
Irwin sent over a draft
of the contract, and it's...

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:37.813
I mean, this job is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:40.349
Well, where's the smile, then?

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:42.984
I just...

01:08:43.053 --> 01:08:45.720
Between Nate and the job and...

01:08:45.756 --> 01:08:47.033
I don't know
what I want anymore...

01:08:47.057 --> 01:08:51.193
And he wants me to sign, you know,
right when I get back to the city.

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:54.261
Well, don't rush a decision.

01:08:54.298 --> 01:08:56.231
In your heart,
you'll know what's best.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.365
No, I've already decided.

01:08:57.401 --> 01:09:00.035
I told Irwin
that I accept his job offer,

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:03.772
so he's just tweaking some terms of
the contract, and, it'll be time to sign.

01:09:05.743 --> 01:09:07.509
You know, I better go pack.

01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:10.845
We have a problem.

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:16.085
- Derek?
- What is it?

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:22.823
A truck jackknifed, and the road's
closed between here and Montpelier.

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:24.203
There's nothing getting through
for hours,

01:09:24.228 --> 01:09:26.906
including half my ingredients, and
all the extra kitchen staff I hired.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:29.096
Okay, so what are we looking at?

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:32.600
Well, I've got no sous chef,
I got no extra staff,

01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:36.438
half of my ingredients
are stuck in traffic...

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:39.006
I'm sorry, Harris.
I think we've got to cancel.

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:42.377
Cancel?
No, we can't cancel!

01:09:42.446 --> 01:09:44.912
We've got half the food bloggers
in New England upstairs,

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:46.228
and they're going
to want dinner!

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.818
And with Irwin here,
my humiliation would be complete.

01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:51.185
No one's canceling anything.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.698
I thought you were headed
back to the city.

01:09:52.723 --> 01:09:55.635
I am, but first, I think
we have a dinner to pull off.

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:56.659
"We?"

01:09:57.461 --> 01:10:00.997
Yes! Me, you... Delia,
Angela... We'll all help out.

01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:03.476
Fiona, that's sweet, but none
of you have any real experience.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.734
You're good with details,
I'm good with speed.

01:10:05.769 --> 01:10:06.902
You're going to need both.

01:10:06.937 --> 01:10:07.803
What about all my ingredients?

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:10.250
Forget the menu, and we'll work
with what we have.

01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:11.684
Yeah, the general store
is going to have things.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:12.874
Exactly!

01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:14.320
They'll have things,
and we'll just improvise,

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:15.789
and what about your
family's famous recipes?

01:10:15.813 --> 01:10:17.145
You can use those.

01:10:17.181 --> 01:10:20.182
Okay.

01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:21.897
You know, Fiona,
you don't have to do this.

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:23.819
It's the least I can do...

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:27.088
And then
we'll call our deal even.

01:10:27.124 --> 01:10:28.223
Okay.

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:36.476
All right, Delia, we'll have you
working front of house.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.812
Brandon, Angela, after you're
done with salads and prep,

01:10:38.836 --> 01:10:39.846
we'll move you over to serving,

01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:41.536
if you think
you can work together.

01:10:41.572 --> 01:10:42.971
We do.

01:10:43.006 --> 01:10:44.840
Fiona and Harris,
we'll have you on the line.

01:10:44.875 --> 01:10:45.707
Okay.

01:10:45.776 --> 01:10:47.809
Okay, now, for the menu...

01:10:47.845 --> 01:10:49.945
Ooh, tourtiere would be good.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.746
- What's tourtiere?
- Meat pie.

01:10:51.782 --> 01:10:54.015
French settlers brought it over
from Quebec.

01:10:54.051 --> 01:10:55.717
It's very delicious,
very Vermont.

01:10:55.786 --> 01:10:57.519
My grandma had an amazing one.

01:10:57.588 --> 01:10:58.420
What about anadama bread?

01:10:58.455 --> 01:10:59.821
Yes...

01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:01.356
And fiddlehead ferns.

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:02.869
You know,
I think this might just work.

01:11:02.893 --> 01:11:05.493
Pure Vermont home-cooking
raised to fine dining.

01:11:05.529 --> 01:11:07.195
Yes, it's like
the yankee credo...

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:08.163
Make do with what you have.

01:11:08.198 --> 01:11:09.664
Let's bring it in.

01:11:10.968 --> 01:11:12.234
Go, team, go!

01:11:15.172 --> 01:11:16.605
Work together, everyone.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.306
We have to sync up
like an assembly line.

01:11:18.342 --> 01:11:19.674
If we get behind
on even one item,

01:11:19.743 --> 01:11:21.109
it will back up
the next 50 dishes.

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:23.545
Us cooking together?

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.480
Kind of takes me back.

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:28.250
Remember
Sunday barbecues on the balcony?

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:32.153
Your steaks, mom's potatoes,
my brownies.

01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:33.455
How could I forget?

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:35.724
Okay, we've got two hours
till the guests arrive.

01:11:35.759 --> 01:11:36.958
Let's get prepping.

01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:40.956
Delia, I've been
looking all over for Fiona.

01:12:40.991 --> 01:12:43.158
Okay, well, she's helping her dad
with something right now,

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:44.793
so why don't you sit with Irwin?

01:12:44.828 --> 01:12:46.528
Do you mind if I sit him
with you here?

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:48.596
Yeah, I thought my eyes
were playing tricks on me.

01:12:48.665 --> 01:12:49.564
You're a long way from Chelsea.

01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:50.777
You're a long way
from Wall Street.

01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:53.202
- Are you ready, Fiona?
- Yes!

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:56.372
It's just perfect.

01:12:57.574 --> 01:13:00.408
- And go!
- Thank you.

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:03.745
All right, team,
let's keep up the work.

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.413
How's it going out there?

01:13:05.449 --> 01:13:07.860
Okay, but you'll never guess
who just showed up.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:08.884
Chauncey.

01:13:10.087 --> 01:13:11.353
What? Why?

01:13:11.388 --> 01:13:13.254
I...

01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:16.558
I went over to apologize for the field,
and I invited him to be our guest.

01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:19.327
I can't believe he said yes.

01:13:19.363 --> 01:13:21.963
He's a thrifty New Englander,
and a free meal's a free meal.

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:27.636
Brandon?

01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:34.809
How do you think it's going?

01:13:34.845 --> 01:13:37.946
Well, I don't know,
but maybe we survived?

01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:42.150
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:45.086
To... speed.

01:13:45.122 --> 01:13:47.255
And yet, taking the time
to do things right.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.426
Excuse me.

01:13:51.495 --> 01:13:53.962
Chauncey is insisting
on having a word with you.

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:57.499
- Be my guest.
- You invited him!

01:13:57.567 --> 01:13:58.733
Come on.

01:13:58.769 --> 01:14:00.869
Okay, fine, we're
in this together.

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:02.137
All right.

01:14:02.172 --> 01:14:03.805
Where's my hockey helmet
when I need it?

01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:09.377
We're in for it.

01:14:09.413 --> 01:14:11.579
Mr. Chauncey?
Was everything okay?

01:14:11.615 --> 01:14:12.981
Okay?

01:14:14.818 --> 01:14:18.053
It was...
Delicious.

01:14:18.088 --> 01:14:19.754
Best meal I've had in years.

01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:22.323
Really?

01:14:22.359 --> 01:14:27.195
Anyone who can cook a dinner
like that is okay in my book...

01:14:27.264 --> 01:14:28.630
Keeping Vermont traditions
alive.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.267
I...
Thank you.

01:14:36.673 --> 01:14:38.673
Someone said to me
recently that...

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:43.211
Good fences make good neighbors.

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:46.681
That might be true.

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:48.950
That field?

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:50.418
It's yours if you still want it.

01:14:52.122 --> 01:14:53.122
Yes!

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:58.893
You can bring by
the papers tomorrow.

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:05.900
- Did that just happen?
- I think so!

01:15:09.473 --> 01:15:11.272
Excuse me?

01:15:11.308 --> 01:15:13.041
My compliments to the chef.

01:15:13.076 --> 01:15:14.209
To both of them.

01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:17.412
I have to say, that dinner
was worth the extra day.

01:15:18.615 --> 01:15:22.217
Now I intend to beat my old rival
at a game of bridge.

01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:23.418
Harris?

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:25.854
You're on.

01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:27.355
I'll bid seven no trump,

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:29.824
and you'll go back to the city
with an empty wallet.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:31.037
Yeah, good luck with that, pal.

01:15:31.061 --> 01:15:34.507
Okay, Fiona, I'm leaving
first thing in the morning,

01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:36.030
so you, young lady,

01:15:36.066 --> 01:15:38.133
have a contract to sign
at my office tomorrow.

01:15:38.168 --> 01:15:39.100
I'll be there.

01:15:39.136 --> 01:15:40.201
Good.
It's gonna be great.

01:15:41.605 --> 01:15:44.239
I guess we both
got what we wanted.

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:45.274
Yeah.

01:15:45.342 --> 01:15:47.075
Thanks again
for your help tonight.

01:15:47.144 --> 01:15:48.209
It's my pleasure.

01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:50.979
I'll...

01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:54.449
I'll leave you to it.

01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:57.185
So, I was thinking,

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.386
if we start back early enough,

01:15:58.455 --> 01:15:59.455
we'll beat the traffic.

01:16:00.323 --> 01:16:02.223
Nate, I need to tell you...

01:16:02.259 --> 01:16:03.791
We both need to move on.

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:06.995
Move on?

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:09.697
Yeah, I'm headed back
to the city with a fresh start,

01:16:09.733 --> 01:16:12.200
and this new job, it's going
to be twice the juggling.

01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:14.802
Yeah.

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:15.737
We'll make it work.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:20.542
No, Nate, I...
I'm sure of this.

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:23.144
I came up here to clear my head,
and I did.

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.513
You were right, and
you deserve the right girl...

01:16:28.818 --> 01:16:30.138
But I'm afraid
that girl isn't me.

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:48.436
- Hey.
- Hey! Are you packed?

01:16:48.505 --> 01:16:52.607
I have to meet Irwin at his office first
thing tomorrow morning to sign the contract.

01:16:52.642 --> 01:16:55.476
You know what? I'm glad we came
up here. It was the right call.

01:16:55.545 --> 01:16:56.911
Yeah, it shook
things up a little.

01:16:56.947 --> 01:16:57.947
Yeah, it did.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:02.483
Fiona, would you mind if, um...

01:17:02.519 --> 01:17:04.452
If I stayed up a little longer?

01:17:04.487 --> 01:17:06.154
Brandon wants to show me around.

01:17:06.223 --> 01:17:10.024
Angela, my brother and my
best friend? Of course not.

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:12.721
I'm happy for you.
I mean, it's a little weird, but...

01:17:14.531 --> 01:17:16.331
Have you had a chance
to say goodbye to Derek?

01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:20.401
He didn't give me a chance to.

01:17:20.437 --> 01:17:22.670
No, he'd already taken off
early this morning.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.907
I've got to go
say bye to my dad.

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:26.942
Good idea.

01:17:29.379 --> 01:17:32.180
I can't believe
we pulled last night off.

01:17:32.215 --> 01:17:34.716
I know.
What a night!

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:36.951
It was just a roaring success.

01:17:36.987 --> 01:17:40.355
Well, we'll have to see
what the bloggers say, but...

01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:42.690
In large part,
I've got you to thank.

01:17:42.726 --> 01:17:44.792
Dad, come on.
It was a team effort.

01:17:44.828 --> 01:17:46.594
I think it was more than that.

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:48.129
Well...

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.430
I should probably head out.

01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:56.015
Promise me you'll come
and visit more often.

01:17:56.039 --> 01:17:57.672
I'll try, dad.

01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:59.741
I really will,
and you know what?

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:01.687
You and Delia should meet me
in the city sometime,

01:18:01.711 --> 01:18:03.071
as much as
you don't like it there.

01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:05.780
Is...
Is that what you think?

01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:11.386
Well, yeah, look how far
you moved just to get away...

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:15.556
From everything.
From our apartment...

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:18.926
The past...
Our lives together.

01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:23.231
Honey...

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:25.833
I know how much
you loved the apartment,

01:18:25.869 --> 01:18:27.168
but I got a secret for you...

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:29.971
So did I,
noise and all.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.440
So then why did you sell it
the first chance you got?

01:18:35.312 --> 01:18:37.512
It was your mom's idea to sell.

01:18:37.547 --> 01:18:40.982
She wanted to move up here
eventually.

01:18:41.051 --> 01:18:43.851
She even found this place.

01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:46.954
But mom...
Mom loved the city.

01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:50.491
Yeah, she did,
and you want to know why?

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:53.028
Because we were there.

01:18:55.065 --> 01:18:58.599
Look...

01:18:58.635 --> 01:18:59.934
When your mom passed away...

01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:04.172
I knew it was time
to live that dream...

01:19:04.207 --> 01:19:06.341
For both of us,
since she was gone.

01:19:08.011 --> 01:19:10.445
My only wish is that
we had done it sooner.

01:19:13.616 --> 01:19:15.183
Why have you never
told me this before?

01:19:17.821 --> 01:19:21.956
I know how much
you loved the old place, and...

01:19:21.991 --> 01:19:24.592
I guess I'm just not very good
dealing with emotions.

01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:27.462
Yeah...

01:19:27.497 --> 01:19:29.263
That runs in the family.

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:35.336
When I was on Wall Street,

01:19:35.372 --> 01:19:38.673
satisfaction was outfoxing Irwin
in some kind of business deal.

01:19:38.708 --> 01:19:41.142
I never imagined

01:19:41.177 --> 01:19:45.713
that running an Inn in Vermont
could be so much more satisfying.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:49.817
I guess
you can surprise yourself.

01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:54.922
Dad, how did you know you'd
end up being happy up here?

01:19:57.694 --> 01:19:59.961
Sometimes...

01:19:59.996 --> 01:20:02.096
You just have a feeling.

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:08.669
I think I know what you mean.

01:20:14.978 --> 01:20:17.678
Fiona...

01:20:17.714 --> 01:20:20.114
I thought you would've been
halfway back to Times Square by now.

01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:22.183
I couldn't leave without
checking on our tree.

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:26.587
It's funny, I used to think the most
important thing was the building...

01:20:26.623 --> 01:20:29.590
The city, the location.

01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:31.819
I think it's part of the reason
I got into Real Estate.

01:20:32.162 --> 01:20:33.528
Yeah?

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:35.941
I've realized something up here.

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:37.064
What's that?

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:41.169
It doesn't matter
if it's Manhattan or Vermont.

01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:43.004
It's not the place
that's important.

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:45.106
It's...

01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:46.641
It's the people.

01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:49.644
It's the memories
that make a place truly special.

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:55.583
I think I could be happy
up here.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:00.521
What about Nate?

01:21:01.724 --> 01:21:04.625
He went back to the city.

01:21:04.661 --> 01:21:05.661
Alone.

01:21:11.034 --> 01:21:12.567
Hey, that's a pretty good haul.

01:21:12.635 --> 01:21:13.868
Yeah.

01:21:13.937 --> 01:21:16.604
I told you good things
come with time.

01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:19.540
They certainly do.

01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:36.324
Honey! Honey!

01:21:36.359 --> 01:21:37.625
What's all the hubbub about?

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.728
The reviews are in.
It's "a tour de force".

01:21:40.763 --> 01:21:45.466
"Vermont traditions with a new spin".
The bloggers are raving!

01:21:45.502 --> 01:21:50.271
- Derek, you did it!
- No, no, we did it.

01:21:50.306 --> 01:21:54.075
I am so happy for the Inn,
but I'll be sad to see you leave.

01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:56.444
Don't be sad, dad.

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:58.145
You'll still have
one of your kids around.

01:21:58.181 --> 01:22:01.349
Yeah. Where is Brandon?

01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:04.051
Dad, I wasn't talking about Brandon.
I was talking about me.

01:22:05.522 --> 01:22:06.954
You tell him the news yet?

01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:08.990
Um, yeah, Brandon's going to
move into my apartment in New York

01:22:09.058 --> 01:22:11.726
and get back into the game,
and...

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:14.729
Well, I'm going
to stay up here for a while...

01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:15.997
Maybe a long while.

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:16.964
Wait.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.766
You're... you're staying?

01:22:18.801 --> 01:22:21.569
I told Irwin no.

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:24.505
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:25.541
Honey!

01:22:26.776 --> 01:22:28.042
That'll be great!

01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:32.547
I mean, who knows, maybe
I can lure some clients up here.

01:22:32.582 --> 01:22:34.342
After all, this place
worked its magic on me.

01:22:35.919 --> 01:22:37.818
That's fantastic!

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.892
Okay.

01:22:46.329 --> 01:22:49.530
- Here it is, straight from the tree.
- To the table.

01:22:49.599 --> 01:22:52.600
New England bread pudding,
and my...

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:54.502
And our maple syrup.

01:23:01.711 --> 01:23:03.311
Don't hold your breath.

01:23:03.379 --> 01:23:05.179
It's okay.

01:23:05.214 --> 01:23:07.081
Some things are
worth waiting for.
