Arson?
What the hell is going on?

00:05.657 --> 00:08.617
-Put a stop to it.
-It'’s out of my hand now.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.445
I'’m calling in that favor.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.142
How will your program survive

00:12.186 --> 00:13.622
if you can'’t afford
to plant next season.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.189
I mean, it wasn'’t a total loss.

00:15.232 --> 00:16.538
You forced people
to work in a hurricane.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.540
You cost two men their lives.

00:18.583 --> 00:21.282
I'’ve lost...
my family.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.979
And I ask you to help...

00:23.023 --> 00:25.112
Charley, Ralph Angel,

00:25.155 --> 00:26.374
and bless Nova.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.811
You keep her safe.
Amen.

[cries]

00:33.250 --> 00:35.513
You all right, ma'’am?

00:35.557 --> 00:36.775
Yeah.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.603
You sure you don'’t want
to take a break?

00:38.647 --> 00:42.607
Get a coffee? Clear your head
from what'’s bothering you?

00:44.131 --> 00:46.263
Well, clearing my head isn'’t...

00:47.438 --> 00:49.527
isn'’t exactly
what I want to do.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.053
Because then
I'’d have to think.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.620
And I don'’t want to think.

00:57.318 --> 01:00.277
I got man problems.

01:00.321 --> 01:02.671
Mill problems.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.107
Kid problems.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.891
Sister problems.

01:05.935 --> 01:11.071
Oh, yeah, and I'’m frigging
running for office.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.768
[laughs]

01:12.811 --> 01:13.769
In New Orleans?

01:15.336 --> 01:16.293
No.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.253
No. But still...

01:19.296 --> 01:20.863
genius, right?

01:22.125 --> 01:24.475
-You'’re running for office.
-Mm-hmm.

01:24.519 --> 01:27.348
And when you leave here,
if you'’re not careful,

01:27.391 --> 01:29.263
you'’re going to see
a lot of people out there

01:29.306 --> 01:30.699
who might recognize you.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.267
And the later
in the morning it gets,

01:33.310 --> 01:34.790
the more packed it gets.

Miss Martha.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.377
Thank you for
allowing me to come.

02:40.421 --> 02:44.164
I don'’t fool with folks unless
their soul'’s been cleansed.

02:44.207 --> 02:48.255
Which means I don'’t fool
with folks in general too often.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.518
But we'’re family, Nova.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.085
[laughs] Oh!

02:54.696 --> 02:58.221
You are the spitting image
of your mama.

02:58.265 --> 03:01.050
And those eyes.

03:01.093 --> 03:04.749
I see nothing but
Lavoisier blood in those eyes.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.449
This is for you.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.798
Oh.

03:13.802 --> 03:14.759
Oh!

03:14.803 --> 03:17.632
Oh, Africa'’s sacred herb.

03:17.675 --> 03:21.288
Trudy used it in most
of her medicinals and smudges.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.725
It was a favorite of hers.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.297
I had a hard time
finding your place.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.255
But it all feels
so familiar.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.474
Well, it should.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.564
I'’ve been here before?

03:36.607 --> 03:38.305
When you were about
three years old

03:38.348 --> 03:41.656
you ran all over this yard,
wearing out your poor mama.

03:41.699 --> 03:42.961
Wow.

03:44.441 --> 03:47.749
I don'’t remember that.
At all.

03:47.792 --> 03:53.624
I'’m sure there are many things
you don'’t quite remember.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.191
Come on.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.367
I'’ll make us some tea.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.938
What?

04:02.981 --> 04:04.287

04:04.331 --> 04:06.420
Country ham,

04:06.463 --> 04:08.987
grits, scrambled eggs,
fancy biscuits,

04:09.031 --> 04:12.948
and that rhubarb strawberry jam
you like so much.

04:12.991 --> 04:15.342
You ain'’t got
to tell me twice. Yes!

04:15.385 --> 04:16.908
[laughs]

04:16.952 --> 04:18.606
So, may I ask,

04:18.649 --> 04:20.260
what'’s the occasion?

04:21.565 --> 04:22.523
Got something on my mind

04:22.566 --> 04:25.395
that I think
I should tell you.

04:25.439 --> 04:28.180
Well, you know,
you can tell me anything.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.707
It'’s about Jimmy Dale.

04:32.750 --> 04:36.014
I know you was protecting me.

04:38.452 --> 04:42.456
But I can'’t get the image
of you beating him

04:42.499 --> 04:43.674
out of my head.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.548
You went somewhere that day.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.900
And the look in your eyes, I...

04:55.425 --> 04:57.819
-I--
-I scared you.

04:59.603 --> 05:00.952
[sighs]

05:00.996 --> 05:03.085
But you'’re right, Vi.
I was protecting you.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.521
I know.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.567
And I know...

05:06.610 --> 05:09.004
that you would
never hurt me.

05:09.047 --> 05:12.573
But the first time
I saw Jimmy Dale get violent,

05:12.616 --> 05:14.401
it wasn'’t with me.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.578
It was with this fool of a man

05:17.621 --> 05:21.233
who was trying to talk to me
in the streets.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.413
That'’s how all this started.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.763
-Vi, if somebody coming at you--
-I know, I know.

05:28.806 --> 05:31.896
Baby I'’m just trying
to get back to us.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.204
I'’m trying to fix this.

05:36.814 --> 05:41.993
And I know that what
I'’m saying right now ain't fair.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.391
but I can'’t shake it.

05:49.697 --> 05:52.526
Okay, well, how do I
fix this?

05:52.569 --> 05:54.658
It'’s not for you to fix.

05:58.401 --> 06:01.143
I think I got some work

06:01.186 --> 06:04.886
I need to do on myself
when it comes to Jimmy Dale.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.412
I never dealt with it.

06:09.456 --> 06:15.113
And I'’m learning things
don'’t go away...

06:17.812 --> 06:20.205
just because you ignore them.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.387
-Morning, Pops.
-Morning, Blue.

06:27.430 --> 06:30.477
Okay, let'’s make a deal here.
No granola today, please.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.695
Today'’s granola day.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.654
[Blue] Yeah, but can I just have
a little bit

06:33.697 --> 06:35.003
of the Sugar Stars mixed in?

06:35.046 --> 06:37.440
Joie has Sugar Stars every day.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.920
That'’s what she tell you.

06:38.963 --> 06:41.662
But I doubt her mama
letting it go down like that.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.577
Did you call Joie'’s mom
and set up a playdate?

06:43.620 --> 06:46.667
Not yet.
Been a lot going on.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.451
-Pops--
-I'’m going to call today.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.235
I promise.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.629
Joie is all he could talk about
all night.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.676
If you'’re too busy,
I can call her mom

06:55.719 --> 06:57.329
and set up a playdate.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.983
What'’s her name?

06:59.027 --> 07:00.507
Oh, Miss Deesha,
she'’s really nice, Mom.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.552
You'’ll like her.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.467
[Ralph Angel] That granola
waiting for you inside.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.338
-[Blue] Okay.
-[Ralph Angel] Ain'’t got time.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.606
Deesha is Joie'’s mom?

07:14.912 --> 07:16.610
You didn'’t tell me.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.481
It'’s not a big deal, Darla.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.004
It'’s a big deal to me.

07:21.789 --> 07:24.313
When I saw you two together...

07:27.098 --> 07:30.275
Deesha knew that I was
Blue'’s mother and your ex...

07:31.581 --> 07:32.800
but I didn'’t know

07:32.843 --> 07:35.193
that she'’s not only
both your new woman,

07:35.237 --> 07:37.152
but the mother
of Blue'’s best friend.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.762
I mean...

07:38.806 --> 07:41.678
why wouldn'’t I want
to know this?

07:41.722 --> 07:43.724
You said you don'’t want
to talk about

07:43.767 --> 07:46.378
those kind of things
with each another.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.554
So I didn'’t.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.558
Look, I know things different.

Just... just got to know I ain'’t
never going to do something

08:00.349 --> 08:01.655
just to hurt you.

Hey, Prosper. Genevieve.

08:13.449 --> 08:16.191
-Your table'’s available.
-[Prosper] Yeah, not this time.

We'’re just picking up lunch
for the campaign office.

08:18.759 --> 08:19.760

08:19.803 --> 08:21.457

Mr. Prosper.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.589
Thank you, Rhonda.

08:24.155 --> 08:26.331
Oh, no, she ain'’t
come by yet.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.595
Yeah, she hasn'’t been
at the office either.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.292
She'’s usually
the first one in.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.989
Yeah, well, she probably
just slept in.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.644
God knows she could do
with a little TLC.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.341
We could all use
a little TLC.

08:36.385 --> 08:39.170
This place feels like
a wake in here.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.651
Yeah, well, after what happened
here and the fire at the mill,

08:41.695 --> 08:43.784
everybody'’s in a bad way.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.046
But you know what I feel?

08:45.089 --> 08:46.569
You get knocked down,
you get back up.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.354
Yeah, well, this was one hell
of a knockdown,

08:49.398 --> 08:51.705
so I'’m not even sure
what the get-up looks like.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.490
Well, I do.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.796
-You do?
-Yeah.

08:55.839 --> 08:56.840
I got an idea.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.363
Idea for what?

08:58.407 --> 09:02.716
Let me talk it over
with Miss Genevieve.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.538
Sorry, I know I should have
texted first.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.192
No, you don'’t got
to text first.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.760
You can come through
whenever you want.

09:46.803 --> 09:49.501
I was just cramming.

-Mm-hmm.

about you.

10:03.211 --> 10:05.648
You'’re always on my mind.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.406
Where'’s your mom?

10:24.449 --> 10:26.713
Oh, between the mill stuff
and the campaign office,

10:26.756 --> 10:29.019
she usually leaves
pretty early.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.021
That'’s what I thought.

of Lavoisier women

11:12.889 --> 11:14.717

11:15.805 --> 11:17.024
Were all the women
in our family

11:17.067 --> 11:18.286
called to be healers?

11:18.329 --> 11:22.377
Yes, but not all
accepted it.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.554
Some of us were coerced
into ignoring our gift.

11:25.597 --> 11:29.558
My own papa wanted me
to reject my calling,

11:29.601 --> 11:31.734
and when I refused, he...

11:31.778 --> 11:34.345
he banished me
from the family.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.739
What did you do after that?

11:36.783 --> 11:41.788
Oh, well, I spent many years
in Haiti and Africa,

11:41.831 --> 11:43.833
becoming a better student.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.707
I came back around
the time you were born,

11:47.750 --> 11:50.622
and I settled in this nice,
peaceful place

11:50.666 --> 11:51.972
where no one bothered me.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.451
[laughs]
Oh!

11:53.495 --> 11:57.586
But your mama'’s visits
were treasures.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.153
And at my request,

11:59.196 --> 12:03.766
she kept my return a secret
until her transition.

12:03.810 --> 12:07.988
But now you did not come here
to look at old pictures

12:08.031 --> 12:09.467
and hear about
my traveling.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.687
Come on, sit down.
Sit down.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.689
When I found out
about you,

12:13.733 --> 12:15.778
I knew I had to meet you.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.739
You came here
because you were led to.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.787
Oh.

12:24.831 --> 12:28.835
Your gift is as strong
as Trudy'’s.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.185
Felt it ever since
I was a kid.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.708
Did you heed the call?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.536
In my own way.

12:34.579 --> 12:35.798
[laughs]

12:35.842 --> 12:37.931
You are Trudy'’s daughter.

12:37.974 --> 12:41.325
She did things
in her own way too.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.863
Okay, hold on.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.476
I love you, Micah.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.912
I love you too.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.827
But you'’re my first everything.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.307
I know.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.178
And I want to respect that.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.225
Your first time
is a big deal.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.618
Are you sure you haven'’t
been with anybody else

13:13.662 --> 13:14.968
since you'’ve been
in St. Jo'’s?

13:15.011 --> 13:16.883
No. I met you
the first month I got here,

13:16.926 --> 13:19.581
and it'’s been us
ever since.

13:19.624 --> 13:20.800
I'’m glad.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.194
Listen, I know we...

13:25.500 --> 13:27.371
I know we were talking
about after prom...

13:29.199 --> 13:31.854
but there'’s a lot going on.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.682
We got exit exams.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.989
Our college admission letters
are going to drop soon.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.642
Graduation.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.863
So I'’m totally cool

13:40.907 --> 13:44.780
if you want
to take more time.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.955
Seriously.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.133
What?

13:51.613 --> 13:53.136
Just the fact
that you'’d say that

13:53.180 --> 13:56.052
makes me that much more sure.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.968
This... us...

13:59.012 --> 14:01.492
it feels like
the real thing.

14:01.536 --> 14:02.798
Doesn'’t it?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.104
Yeah.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.716
[sighs]

14:10.023 --> 14:11.676
[cell phone rings]

14:17.247 --> 14:18.901
Hey, Mom. What'’s up?

14:18.945 --> 14:20.381
Hey.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.950
Making sure you got
to school okay.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.778
Yeah. Yeah, I'’m good.

14:26.822 --> 14:32.219
I need some hands at the
mill office when you'’re off.

14:32.262 --> 14:35.178
Okay, okay. I'’ll stop by
right after last period.

14:35.222 --> 14:38.051
You'’re such a good person.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.096
I don'’t deserve you.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.490
I don'’t.

14:43.708 --> 14:44.927
You okay, Mom?

14:44.971 --> 14:46.711
Yeah. I'’m fine.

14:48.975 --> 14:52.804
Go on back. I'’ll...
I'’ll see you a little later.

14:52.848 --> 14:53.980
Okay?

14:55.198 --> 14:56.373
All right.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.999
-[Ralph Angel] What'’s up, Wood?
-What'’s happening?

15:13.042 --> 15:14.652
Picking up
some supplies,

15:14.696 --> 15:17.003
figured I'’d pop in,
see how you was holding up

15:17.046 --> 15:18.830
without your full team.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.006
Making do.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.313
Shutting down
my re-entry program.

15:23.357 --> 15:26.012
-Say what?
-Further notice, they said.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.450
Oh, I'’m sorry, brother.

15:29.493 --> 15:32.975
I was just trying to do
something good, you know?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.629
I know, man.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.065
I know.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.154
I'’ve been feeling empty, Wood.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.332
I don'’t know why.
I just...

15:44.639 --> 15:47.076
Ain'’t nothing
been feeling right.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.296
Look, man, you...

15:49.339 --> 15:51.559
you'’re just in the fire
right now, that'’s it.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.910
Nova'’s book got you feeling
some kind of way.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.739
You in a new relationship
that ain'’t even on its feet yet.

15:57.782 --> 16:01.090
Your workers are all scattered
all over the place.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.700
That'’s why.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.616
It'’s normal, brother.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.577
Yeah, maybe.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.843
Look here, man,
my boys Irvin and Owen

16:14.886 --> 16:16.932
are going to stop by
later on tonight.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.412
Why don'’t you come by?

16:18.455 --> 16:20.631
Oh, man, I'’m one step
ahead of you.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.373
I'’m going to kick back.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.332
My acres are ready
for my soybeans.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.988
It'’ll take a while
without all my workers.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.644
All right, brother.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.124
After a while,
all right?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.694
Man, I appreciate you
stopping by.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.054
-I'’ll take it on back
to the walk-in.
-Okay, baby.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.273
Thank you.

16:56.754 --> 16:57.842
What'’s that?

16:57.886 --> 17:01.281
It'’s a Mexican chocolate
pepper pie.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.109
My mom wanted you
to have it...

17:04.458 --> 17:07.156
as a thank-you for giving me
a second chance.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.290
Rhonda, baby...

17:10.333 --> 17:12.248
take that.

17:12.292 --> 17:16.078
There'’s a list on
the chalkboard in the hallway.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.167
I expect you to complete
everything on it

17:18.211 --> 17:19.255
by the end of your shift.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.778
Yes, ma'’am.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.957
Thank you again.

17:27.655 --> 17:28.873
Okay.

17:38.622 --> 17:42.452
[Ms. Blanche] So, Trudy'’s been
visiting you in your dreams.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.325
At first it was
just a feeling.

17:45.368 --> 17:47.457
Her presence.

17:47.501 --> 17:50.808
But recently, the dreams
have become different.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.116
I almost see her.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.815
I reach out to touch her,
and...

17:59.339 --> 18:01.297
that'’s when the dream ends.

18:09.305 --> 18:12.047
This belonged to your mama.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.136
Her remedy book.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.399
Notes she was taking

18:16.443 --> 18:19.489
when she was studying
to be a healer.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.405
She gave it to me
when she left this life

18:22.449 --> 18:24.494
and chose another path.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.497
You mean when she turned away
from her calling

18:27.541 --> 18:29.847
because she accidentally
got pregnant with me?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.327
Accidentally?

18:31.371 --> 18:33.547
Oh, no, no.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.897
It took her a while,
but she came to realize

18:35.940 --> 18:38.247
that nothing in her life
was an accident.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.249
Not Ernest,

18:40.293 --> 18:42.599
and certainly not you.

18:42.643 --> 18:46.777
But Mama gave up what she loved
for what she had to do, right?

18:46.821 --> 18:51.478
Oh, my goodness,
you have it twisted, child.

18:53.088 --> 18:54.220
Know this.

18:57.048 --> 19:00.182
You and Ralph Angel

19:00.226 --> 19:04.273
were a source of great joy
to Trudy.

19:05.883 --> 19:08.973
She'’s visiting you
in your dreams

19:09.017 --> 19:12.412
because she wants you to know
she misses you.

19:13.413 --> 19:14.892
She loves you.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.940
She'’s watching over you.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.291
She wants to remind you

19:22.335 --> 19:24.206
to be you.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.341
You should go see her
more often.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.472
See her?

19:29.516 --> 19:31.648
What do you mean?
Mama was cremated.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.999
After she died, Daddy
scattered her ashes in the wind.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.871
[laughs]
No.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.307
No, chère.

19:38.351 --> 19:41.267
Your father buried your mother
on the family farm.

19:41.310 --> 19:44.357
That was her last gift to him,

19:44.400 --> 19:45.836
to you and to your brother.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.323
[sighs]

19:58.284 --> 20:00.199
All I'’m saying, though,
is this, man.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.591
The Saints'’ coach,
he act like, you know,

20:01.635 --> 20:03.680
good defense is optional.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.421
Man, ain'’t nothing wrong
with their defense.

20:05.465 --> 20:06.683
Ain'’t that right,
Hollywood?

20:06.727 --> 20:08.903
All I know is if the refs
can throw a flag

20:08.946 --> 20:11.297
with a man who'’s getting abused
out of bounds,

20:11.340 --> 20:12.733
we get that championship.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.430
Speaking of the Super Bowl,

20:14.474 --> 20:15.692
you make it to the big game,

20:15.736 --> 20:17.694
maybe you take
some of that green you got

20:17.738 --> 20:20.480
and charter a plane for all
of us, make it a big party.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.134
[laughs]
See? That'’s how I know
y'’all ain't married.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.788
Think Vi would put up
with that foolishness?

20:24.832 --> 20:26.616
-You do what Violet says?
-Hell yeah.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.750
What am I going to do?
Lay up with your rusty ass?

20:29.793 --> 20:31.926
-[laughs]
-Speaking of Vi, though,

20:31.969 --> 20:34.320
I heard that you had
a little run-in with her ex.

20:34.363 --> 20:35.321
[chuckles]

20:35.364 --> 20:36.713
Oh, yeah?
Where you hear that at?

20:36.757 --> 20:38.324
[Irvin]
Hey, man, small town.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.064
You know people ain'’t got
nothing better to do

20:40.108 --> 20:41.457
than talk about
other people'’s business.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.111
[laughter]

20:44.547 --> 20:47.681
I heard that old boy
showed up uninvited,

20:47.724 --> 20:49.465
and then you showed him
his way out...

20:49.509 --> 20:50.814
headfirst.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.294
[Irvin]
That man had it coming too.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.904
He lucky to still be walking.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.384
Ain'’t that right,
Hollywood?

20:55.428 --> 20:56.994
[laughter]

20:57.038 --> 20:59.475
You know, maybe I could have
handled it a little bit better.

20:59.519 --> 21:00.737
Kept a cooler head.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.783
I know this:
a man put a hands on my woman,

21:02.826 --> 21:04.306
he'’s going to be
six feet under.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.003
[laughs]

21:06.047 --> 21:07.614
I don'’t know, O.

21:07.657 --> 21:10.094
You know, it'’s a little bit
more complicated than that.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.705
Hey, man, ain'’t nothing
complicated, man,

21:11.748 --> 21:13.402
about protecting your wife.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.491
[both laugh]

21:15.535 --> 21:16.971
[Irvin]
Damn right.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.670
So I'’m handling the drinks,

21:20.714 --> 21:23.717
and Prosper'’s taking care
of the music.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.719
Violet, you'’re handling...?

21:25.762 --> 21:27.677
Food and decorations.

21:27.721 --> 21:30.071
It'’s going to be
a great event.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.594
Micah? You okay, baby?

21:31.638 --> 21:34.336
Hey, auntie. I'’m good.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.077
How are you?

21:36.120 --> 21:37.426
I'’m good.

21:37.470 --> 21:40.690
Hello, Mr. Prosper.
Ms. Genevieve.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.170
Have any of you
seen my mom?

21:42.213 --> 21:44.520
I'’ve been trying to get
a hold of her all day.

21:44.564 --> 21:45.826
Yeah, me too.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.393
When'’s the last time
you saw her?

21:47.436 --> 21:49.960
Last night,
before we went to bed.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.485
But this morning she calls me
and tells me

21:52.528 --> 21:53.790
to meet her
at her mill office,

21:53.834 --> 21:56.924
but she never showed.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.448
I don'’t know, it's probably
not a big deal, but...

21:59.492 --> 22:01.537
Can you try and track her
on that phone thing of yours?

22:01.581 --> 22:03.452
Yeah, I'’m trying now.

22:03.496 --> 22:04.714
[cell phone chimes]

22:04.758 --> 22:07.500
Actually, I think
I'’m getting something.

22:07.543 --> 22:10.938
It says that
she'’s in New Orleans...

22:10.981 --> 22:12.200
on Poydras.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.071
She'’s, like,
near the convention center.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.596
[Violet]
What'’s she doing way down there?

22:16.639 --> 22:18.424
[Prosper]
Good question.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.428
[exhales]

22:22.471 --> 22:23.820
[playing upbeat
bluesy music]

22:28.347 --> 22:30.087
Hold up, guys.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.263
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.613
Guys, this is Darla.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.441
-Hi, guys.
-[woman] Hey, Darla.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.747
-[man] Hey, what'’s up?
-Let'’s take a break,
everybody.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.575
Just need a minute.

22:42.448 --> 22:46.321
This is a truly
a great surprise.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.541
I was hoping to get to hear

22:48.584 --> 22:51.587
a couple of minutes
of your rehearsal.

22:55.765 --> 23:00.248
And I brought you
and the guys some beignets.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.513
Appreciate that. I do.
But...

23:05.601 --> 23:07.168
we need to talk.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.955
I read Nova'’s book.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.611
Right.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.005
Of course.

23:18.048 --> 23:19.267
I was...

23:19.310 --> 23:21.661
I was wondering
why you hadn'’t been

23:21.704 --> 23:23.402
returning my calls and texts.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.446
I was going to,

23:24.490 --> 23:27.797
as soon as I could
find a way--

23:27.841 --> 23:31.975
You know, you could have
at least faced me in person,

23:32.019 --> 23:35.414
rather than ghosting me
like a teenager.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.807
I'’m not ghosting you, Darla.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.374
And I'’m not judging you.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.203
But I do have a problem

23:42.246 --> 23:43.509
with what I read, and--

23:43.552 --> 23:46.686
My past is more important to you
than right now.

23:48.383 --> 23:49.906
And I thought...

23:49.950 --> 23:54.171
I thought you of all people
would understand.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.305
But, I mean, it'’s fine.
I get it.

23:57.348 --> 23:58.828
I don'’t think you do.

23:58.872 --> 24:01.614
My issue isn'’t with the book
or what'’s inside it.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.790
I don'’t care
about your past.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.879
I care about your future.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.535
And mine.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.537
What'’s that supposed to mean?

24:14.322 --> 24:16.629
I think you'’re two minutes away
from relapsing,

24:16.672 --> 24:18.369
and you'’re not doing anything
about it.

24:18.413 --> 24:19.719
What?

24:19.762 --> 24:21.590
I'’m fine, Leo.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.679
When'’s the last time
you called your sponsor?

24:23.723 --> 24:26.029
I don'’t know.
A couple weeks ago?

24:26.073 --> 24:28.771
I know the signs of a relapse.
I'’ve had several.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.904
And there'’s no way that my past

24:30.947 --> 24:32.340
can be made public
like yours was,

24:32.383 --> 24:35.256
and it not have a bad effect
on me.

24:35.299 --> 24:38.041
That'’s you. I feel fine.
And in control.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.261
I'’m still working
my steps.

24:42.611 --> 24:43.786
What do you want to do?

24:44.918 --> 24:47.355
For the sake
of my own sobriety...

24:49.923 --> 24:54.580
I need to pump the brakes on our
relationship for a little while.

24:56.843 --> 24:59.846
Listen, we got a gig later

24:59.889 --> 25:02.239
and need to get back
to rehearsing.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.242
I'’ll call you
in a couple days.

25:07.593 --> 25:08.942
Maybe we can talk.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.820
All right, y'’all,
let'’s get back to it.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.760
The bill, please.

25:49.939 --> 25:51.767
Why are you here?

25:56.642 --> 25:58.992
Your son is concerned about you.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.430
He called me.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.389
Told me where to look.

26:06.347 --> 26:07.740
Let'’s get out of here.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.098
No.

26:18.141 --> 26:19.752
Not-- Not with you.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.019
I know you'’re still angry
with me.

26:27.498 --> 26:30.589
I understand why
more and more each day.

26:32.112 --> 26:35.202
But right now,
you also need to be safe.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.293
You'’re running for office.

26:40.816 --> 26:41.730
Come on.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.559
You'’re going home.

26:48.911 --> 26:50.609
Please.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.614
Come on.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.498
Hey-hey.

27:12.718 --> 27:13.632
Hey.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.340
You mad at me?

27:27.646 --> 27:28.951
No.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.518
No, baby.

27:30.561 --> 27:33.086
Just got a whole lot
on my mind right now.

27:38.526 --> 27:41.703
Owen and Irvin was over
from the rig.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.313
How they doing?

27:43.357 --> 27:46.795
They heard about the beating
I put on Jimmy Dale.

27:46.839 --> 27:49.537
They was glad about it.
Gave me props.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.888
Well, you guys
like that kind of talk.

27:52.932 --> 27:56.239
You know, usually I'’d enjoy it,
but I don'’t know.

27:56.283 --> 27:58.024
It must have been
something you said

27:58.067 --> 28:00.417
that made me realize

28:00.461 --> 28:02.463
that most times, when me
and the fellas get together,

28:02.506 --> 28:04.987
all we doing is keeping
the jokes

28:05.031 --> 28:06.946
and the sports talk coming.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.295
Something wrong with that?

28:08.338 --> 28:10.906
Well, it is if that'’s
the only thing we doing.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.039
Seems like the only time
I ever talk about any real stuff

28:13.082 --> 28:14.518
is when I'’m with you.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.697
Like today, when I really
didn'’t even know

28:18.740 --> 28:21.177
what to say to Ralph Angel
when he was down.

28:22.788 --> 28:26.792
Well, we women have had lots of
practice talking to each other.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.402
[chuckles]

28:31.057 --> 28:32.754
Look at this.

28:34.364 --> 28:38.455
Now how come us men don'’t do
things in groups like y'’all do?

28:38.499 --> 28:39.935
All these different
support groups

28:39.979 --> 28:43.286
for women in St. Jo'’s,
and not one for men.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.204
Maybe if we had one,

28:48.248 --> 28:50.206
we wouldn'’t scare the women
we love so much

28:50.250 --> 28:52.252
with the way we act
sometimes.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.386
Maybe you'’re right.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.738
That'’s all the lights I got.

28:59.781 --> 29:00.782
Ooh.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.218
That going to be enough?

29:02.262 --> 29:03.742
Man, this is more
than enough.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.831
Aunt Vi'’s going to be
super happy, man.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.007
Ain'’t no thing.
Ain'’t no thing.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.835
All right.

29:13.534 --> 29:14.883
Yo, can I ask you
something?

29:14.927 --> 29:17.016
Anything and always.

29:17.059 --> 29:18.582
What'’s going on?

29:18.626 --> 29:20.584
It'’s about relationships.

29:20.628 --> 29:21.977
You and Keke all right?

29:22.021 --> 29:24.763

...we'’re ready to take it
to the next level.

29:31.204 --> 29:32.422
Ah.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.815
It'’s her first time,

29:33.859 --> 29:35.861
and I'’m not too far
behind myself.

29:35.904 --> 29:37.863
Just...

29:37.906 --> 29:39.952
it'’s a big deal
for both of us.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.910
It'’s important you do right
by her.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.391
Yeah. I mean, things are great
between us now,

29:44.434 --> 29:47.089
but with college,
I don'’t know.

29:47.133 --> 29:48.569

You know, change is always
going to come.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.882

is that you got love for her.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.318
Yeah.

29:58.361 --> 30:00.102
I think I do.

30:00.146 --> 30:02.539

all the time.

30:02.583 --> 30:05.064
-Yeah, you in there.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.507
But how do you know
it'’s for real?

30:13.550 --> 30:15.422
Like, my dad told my mom
he loved her,

30:15.465 --> 30:16.815
and look how that
turned out.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.773
Don'’t worry
about all that.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.906
You ain'’t your daddy, Micah.

30:20.949 --> 30:23.386
The real question is,
what'’s your gut saying?

30:23.430 --> 30:25.519
I don'’t know.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.131

if I stop tripping about

30:29.175 --> 30:31.090

might not happen

30:31.133 --> 30:34.267
and just be with her.

-[laughs]
-What?

30:59.814 --> 31:01.860

to say good night.

a hundred times.

31:22.271 --> 31:24.012
I'’m sorry.

31:26.449 --> 31:27.842
How was school?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.626
School was just okay.

31:29.670 --> 31:32.238
But recess was amazing.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.022
Oh, yeah?
Tell me why.

31:34.066 --> 31:36.155
Joie made this really
cool model space rocket

31:36.198 --> 31:38.940
with Miss Deesha,
and they brought it to school.

31:38.984 --> 31:42.944
And all recess we pretended
that we were astronauts.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.467
And guess what?

31:44.511 --> 31:46.295
I was the one
who got to walk on the moon.

31:46.339 --> 31:49.472
Just like you taught me
when we played astronauts.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.953
-What? Wow, that'’s amazing.
-Yeah.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.477
Joie wanted to do the moonwalk,

31:54.521 --> 31:57.045
but we drew straws
and I won.

31:57.089 --> 31:58.568
You should have seen me, Mom.

31:58.612 --> 32:01.354
I was walking in slow motion

32:01.397 --> 32:04.661
like those astronauts
in those old moonwalk videos.

32:04.705 --> 32:09.318

gave us all cupcakes
