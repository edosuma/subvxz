WEBVTT

00:01.433 --> 00:04.200
My sister says
it's almost time

00:04.266 --> 00:07.433
for you to fly back
to the Temple.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.300
We're coming with you.
[laughs]

00:09.366 --> 00:11.666
[Mack]
Who did this to you?

00:11.733 --> 00:13.233
[chokes] "Moth."

00:14.300 --> 00:16.133
Moth? I'll kill him.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.433
Not him.

00:17.900 --> 00:18.866
Her.

00:21.533 --> 00:23.366
[Catrina]
Who do you pray to?

00:23.866 --> 00:25.600
I heard Konnan praying

00:25.666 --> 00:28.866
as the life drained from him
in that casket.

00:28.933 --> 00:31.300
Maybe it will be you
to make a sacrifice

00:31.366 --> 00:33.266
in honor of your master.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.266
[Striker]  The match is over.
Puma is victorious.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.966
Will Puma break
Pentagon's arm?

00:39.433 --> 00:40.866
But he chose not to.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.000
[speaking in Spanish]

00:42.066 --> 00:43.466
He wanted to humiliate me.

00:43.566 --> 00:44.700
Give me that battle.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.733
[Catrina]
You want Prince Puma?

00:50.800 --> 00:51.833
You can have him.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.300
Just be warned.

00:53.366 --> 00:55.133
Putting your hands on me

00:55.200 --> 00:57.533
Was the biggest mistake
you ever made.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.666
You took the title,

00:59.733 --> 01:02.533
but did not
destroy the man.

01:03.033 --> 01:06.000
Kill the Fenix
once and for all.

01:06.933 --> 01:08.266
[Striker]  Oh, shit.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.233
[bell dings]

01:10.300 --> 01:12.000
[King Cuerno]
The Fenix won't die.

01:12.066 --> 01:14.166
I'm officially claiming
my title match.

01:14.466 --> 01:17.300
You'll be defending
that title against Fenix.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.500
I know the Fenix can fly,
and I hope you can, too.

01:21.166 --> 01:22.300
It's a ladder match.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.066
[Catrina]
You've summoned me?

01:44.366 --> 01:47.433
You let
them fight each other,

01:48.466 --> 01:50.466
But don't let them
fight me?

01:51.200 --> 01:55.133
I should have sent them
into the darkness weeks ago.

01:55.966 --> 01:59.333
But I listened to you!

02:00.866 --> 02:04.433
I've known you
since you were a little boy.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.800
A scared little boy
as I recall.

02:08.466 --> 02:11.000
If it wasn't for me,

02:11.333 --> 02:13.433
Pascual Mendoza...

02:15.833 --> 02:18.233
[exhales deeply]

02:18.766 --> 02:20.400
...You would have never

02:20.466 --> 02:22.533
have found yourself

02:22.600 --> 02:25.400
out of that tomb
the gods put you in.3

02:26.433 --> 02:27.966
[grunts]

02:28.033 --> 02:30.000
[breathing heavily]

02:31.233 --> 02:35.266
If I could bury you right now,
I would.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.166
Give me Pentagon and Puma.

02:40.466 --> 02:42.666
I'll bury them instead.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.000
No.

02:53.333 --> 02:57.700
[screams]

03:06.266 --> 03:07.800
[theme music playing]

03:21.466 --> 03:25.500
[crowd chanting "lucha"]

03:26.533 --> 03:28.266
[Striker]  What's up,
ladies and gentlemen?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.333
This is "Lucha Underground,"

03:30.400 --> 03:32.633
and tonight is huge.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.833
We have two main event-caliber
matches for you tonight.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.133
Matt, I'm noticing

03:39.200 --> 03:41.400
that Mil Muertes
is not on his throne.

03:41.466 --> 03:44.000
I'm wondering
where our champion could be.

03:44.066 --> 03:46.700
Well, thank heavens
Melissa Santos showed up.

03:46.766 --> 03:48.900
Melissa, let's lucha.

03:48.966 --> 03:50.466
[bell dings]

03:50.533 --> 03:53.566
[Santos]   The following lucha
is scheduled for one fall.

03:53.633 --> 03:54.700
Introducing first,

03:54.766 --> 03:57.466
From Monterrey,
Nuevo León, Mexico,

03:57.866 --> 04:01.433
she is Sexy Star.

04:01.933 --> 04:07.333
[Striker]  Last year,
this young lady took
Lucha Underground by storm,

04:07.400 --> 04:10.666
getting in the ring
with anyone

04:10.733 --> 04:12.966
that our former boss,
Dario Cueto,

04:13.033 --> 04:14.333
would put
in front of her.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.766
And through that fight,

04:15.833 --> 04:20.566
Sexy Star has inspired
and influenced a generation,

04:20.633 --> 04:24.500
and she is back here
in Lucha Underground.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.166
And her opponent,

04:28.233 --> 04:31.466
from Tuxla Gutiérrez,
Chiapas, Mexico,

04:32.200 --> 04:34.966
she is Kobra Moon.

04:35.033 --> 04:37.433
[Striker]
Ooh, another new face
here in the Temple.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.933
We were introduced to
Kobra Moon a few weeks ago.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.466
From what we saw in that
small little sample size,

04:44.533 --> 04:47.533
very serpentine,
very slick movements.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.766
How that will translate
into a fight with Sexy Star,

04:50.833 --> 04:52.266
Vamp, your thoughts.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.500
[Vampiro]  Sexy Star
is the new generation.

04:54.566 --> 04:57.233
She stood up,
she showed what
women today can do.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.333
She's a warrior.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.566
But Kobra Moon,
let's not forget,

05:00.633 --> 05:03.233
she comes from one of
the oldest tribes in Mexico.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.833
So we've got something
extremely evil and ancient

05:05.900 --> 05:07.900
against something
heroic and new.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.300
Kobra Moon has a victory
over Bengala,

05:11.366 --> 05:13.033
but with all due respect,

05:13.466 --> 05:15.900
Sexy Star is
an entirely different animal.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.333
Evilness...

05:18.400 --> 05:21.000
- [bell dings]
-...I dig it so much, Matt,
so much.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.333
There's something
psychologically seductive

05:24.400 --> 05:25.933
about Kobra Moon,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.500
as she gets set
to square off with Sexy Star.

05:28.566 --> 05:29.866
[Striker]
Sexy's hands are high.

05:29.933 --> 05:32.800
Kobra trying to get her head
lower than her opponent's.

05:34.266 --> 05:35.400
Here we go now.

05:35.466 --> 05:37.933
Go-behind, trying to manipulate
the hips here.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Kobra Moon
in control of Sexy Star.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.700
Nice break there
and switches.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.133
-Whoa.
-Oh, very slick there.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.433
[Striker]  Ow!

05:50.033 --> 05:52.733
For two new luchadoras
feeling each other out,

05:53.500 --> 05:56.400
you feel that this is gonna
combust at some point.

05:56.466 --> 05:57.800
Oh, hang on.

05:57.866 --> 06:00.700
Looks like The Mack
has joined us here.

06:02.700 --> 06:05.466
[Vampiro]  What the hell
is he doing?

06:06.466 --> 06:08.633
-[Striker]  Kobra Moon
slowing now.
-Ooh.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.633
[Striker]  Nice venomous strike.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.533
[Vampiro]  Bro, I'm feeling it.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.433
[Striker]  Oh, nice knee
to the gut there.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.466
Kobra set the pace
nice and slow.

06:17.533 --> 06:20.500
Once sexy changed the pace,
Kobra attacked.

06:21.733 --> 06:22.766
[Vampiro]  Good.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.133
[Striker]  Kobra Moon
to the arm.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.466
- [Vampiro]  Look at that.
-Wise strategy.

06:25.533 --> 06:26.666
- [Striker]  Length.
-Nice.

06:26.733 --> 06:28.700
- [Vampiro]
Pressure on the elbow.
-Hyper-extending. Good.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.833
[Vampiro]
Willie Mack trying to be
like Mickey from "Rocky."

06:33.900 --> 06:34.966
[Striker]  Seems like the Mack

06:35.033 --> 06:38.266
is leading the crowd
to cheer for Sexy Star.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.333
Whoa,
slap across the face.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.366
And now Sexy Star

06:42.433 --> 06:44.600
with the spirit
of Selena and Celia Cruz

06:44.666 --> 06:45.866
rolled into one,

06:45.933 --> 06:46.833
here she comes!

06:46.900 --> 06:48.033
[Mack] Stay on her!

06:48.100 --> 06:49.400
That's what
I'm talking about.

06:49.466 --> 06:51.000
[Vampiro]  Well, let's just say

06:51.066 --> 06:54.600
that finally somebody's
standing up to Sexy Star,
maybe.

06:54.666 --> 06:57.000
-[crowd "whoos"]
-Ooh.

06:58.933 --> 07:00.433
I can't get what the Mack's
doing out here.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.500
I'd like to know.

07:01.566 --> 07:03.233
[Mack] oh, come on, man.

07:04.900 --> 07:08.600
[Striker]  And now Kobra Moon
has sexy wrapped up.

07:08.666 --> 07:10.033
-Ooh.
-Ooh, nice.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.633
- [Vampiro]  Yes.
-Nice submission here.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.833
[Vampiro]
Oh! God, could have separated
her shoulder right there.

07:15.066 --> 07:16.166
There you go.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.666
-[Striker]  No.
-Ooh.

07:23.133 --> 07:24.333
[Vampiro]  Fans are feeling it.

07:24.933 --> 07:27.400
[Striker]
I like how close Kobra Moon
stays to her opponent.

07:27.700 --> 07:28.900
Let's not forget.

07:28.966 --> 07:31.500
Sexy is familiar
with the atmosphere
here in the Temple.

07:31.566 --> 07:32.666
Kobra is not.

07:32.733 --> 07:34.133
[Vampiro]  I don't think
Sexy's familiar

07:34.200 --> 07:35.866
with a boot in the lung
on the back.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.433
[crowd chants
"let's go, sexy"]

07:37.500 --> 07:38.833
[crowd chants
"Kobra Moon"]

07:38.900 --> 07:41.833
-All the believers
are firmly behind Sexy Star.
- [Vampiro]  Yeah.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.466
[man]
Sexy Star! Sexy Star!

07:44.533 --> 07:46.266
[Striker]  On the move now.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.766
Body scissor, roll up.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.466
Could we see it here?

07:50.533 --> 07:52.833
This modified
pendulum surfboard.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.400
Vicious,
vicious submission.

07:55.466 --> 07:57.300
If sexy can stand up,

07:57.366 --> 08:00.766
all the pressure now
on the knees and the back.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.833
But...
look, look. "The Moth."

08:02.900 --> 08:04.766
That's Marty the Moth.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.166
Sexy took her eyes
off the prize,

08:07.233 --> 08:10.733
And now Kobra Moon
into the dragon sleeper

08:10.800 --> 08:12.066
with the body scissors.

08:12.133 --> 08:13.833
This is what Kobra used

08:13.900 --> 08:16.866
to lead herself to a victory
a couple of weeks ago.

08:16.933 --> 08:18.700
-The submission hold.
-[Vampiro] Sexy tapped!
Sexy tapped!

08:18.766 --> 08:20.633
[Santos]
Here's your winner.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.100
Kobra Moon!

08:23.166 --> 08:24.833
- [Striker]  Vamp...
-She tapped, bro.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.366
[Striker]  I've never seen
Sexy Star tap out.

08:27.433 --> 08:28.466
Never.

08:30.333 --> 08:34.066
Listen, albeit Marty the Moth's
slight distraction,

08:34.133 --> 08:37.266
take nothing away from
Kobra Moon's victory here.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.600
And we're not done

08:39.666 --> 08:42.066
because we are going
to a much darker place.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.933
Not only will we bring you
Pentagon Jr. Vs Prince Puma,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.433
we also have a ladder match

08:48.500 --> 08:51.266
for the Gift of the Gods
Championship.

08:51.333 --> 08:55.800
Two of the most athletic,
inspired individuals
in Lucha Underground,

08:55.866 --> 08:58.866
Fenix, the Challenger,
King Cuerno, the Champion.

08:58.933 --> 09:01.866
It comes you way tonight
on "Lucha Underground."

09:03.300 --> 09:05.233
Hi, I'm Famous B.

09:05.300 --> 09:08.066
And how exactly
did I get a name like that?

09:08.933 --> 09:09.933
Because I'm famous.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.700
I've dominated the world
of underground fighting.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.166
[tink]

09:17.233 --> 09:19.500
And I want to pass my knowledge
on to you.

09:19.866 --> 09:21.866
So are you tired
of the same old life?

09:22.233 --> 09:25.000
Do you want to become
a famous fighter just like me?

09:25.700 --> 09:26.533
Well, now you can.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.166
Just pick up the phone,

09:28.233 --> 09:32.233
call the number 423-get-fame.

09:34.266 --> 09:37.433
That's 423-get-fame.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.633
[pow!]

09:39.700 --> 09:40.633
[tink]

09:40.700 --> 09:41.866
So call me now

09:41.933 --> 09:46.466
and let Famous B
help you become famous.

09:52.233 --> 09:54.066
Hey, I was watching that.

10:00.966 --> 10:02.466
There's no time for TV.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.933
Your training is the most
important thing right now.

10:05.666 --> 10:07.266
We have to get you ready.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.266
[panting]

10:18.333 --> 10:19.700
Ready for what?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.800
Your destiny.

10:28.766 --> 10:29.833
[grunts]

10:41.366 --> 10:43.133
[King Cuerno]
Hunting pleases me.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.266
I am not
the bloodthirsty killer,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.366
but I don't deny

10:47.433 --> 10:49.966
that the ultimate goal
of a hunter

10:50.033 --> 10:51.466
is the death of your prey.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.866
I embrace the hunt
with anticipation.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.533
And in the event
the kill is successfully made,

11:02.066 --> 11:04.366
I feel absolutely no remorse.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.333
[Striker]
The thrill of the hunt.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.066
[King Cuerno]
Only a sense of....

11:09.733 --> 11:11.100
Satisfaction.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.866
And tonight,

11:19.933 --> 11:22.066
when I climb that ladder
to the heavens

11:22.133 --> 11:24.000
and retrieve my prize,

11:24.466 --> 11:27.700
King Cuerno will no longer be
just a hunter.

11:29.066 --> 11:30.533
I will be a god,

11:32.233 --> 11:36.400
and soon, the next
Lucha Underground champion.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.466
[crowd chanting "lucha"]

11:53.533 --> 11:55.100
[bell dings]

11:55.166 --> 11:58.033
The following lucha
is scheduled for one fall.

11:58.266 --> 11:59.633
Introducing first,

11:59.700 --> 12:03.000
he is the former
Lucha Underground champion,

12:03.066 --> 12:06.266
from Boyle Heights,
Los Angeles, California,

12:06.900 --> 12:09.866
Prince Puma!

12:09.933 --> 12:12.300
[Striker]  Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome back to
"Lucha Underground."

12:12.366 --> 12:14.000
The first
of our two main events.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.133
As you see that man,

12:15.200 --> 12:18.133
the first ever
Lucha Underground champion,

12:18.200 --> 12:21.900
Prince Puma makes his way
amongst the believers

12:21.966 --> 12:23.133
into the Temple.

12:23.566 --> 12:25.866
Vamp, last year,
this was a fighter

12:25.933 --> 12:29.966
that really put
Lucha Underground on the map.

12:30.033 --> 12:32.533
Everyone that has ever
seen this man compete

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
all say
the same thing about him:

12:34.766 --> 12:36.200
That he's absolutely
exceptional.

12:36.266 --> 12:37.533
Your thoughts.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.266
[Vampiro] He not only put
Lucha Underground on the map,

12:39.500 --> 12:40.566
he put Boyle Heights,

12:40.633 --> 12:41.800
he put himself,
Prince Puma on the map.

12:41.866 --> 12:43.900
He changed the face
of wrestling last year,

12:43.966 --> 12:45.933
not just in the united states,
but worldwide.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.033
He brought what is lucha libre
to the forefront.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.300
The weight of the shoulders
was on this man last year,

12:51.366 --> 12:52.933
and I'm hoping
it's not too much,

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
and he can continue on

12:54.066 --> 12:55.866
with the success
that he's had worldwide.

12:55.933 --> 12:57.133
Only good things can come

12:57.200 --> 12:59.200
if he keeps his feet
planted on the ground.

12:59.433 --> 13:02.600
[Striker]
Now, Puma's rivalry
with Pentagon.

13:03.266 --> 13:04.700
How does this affect

13:04.766 --> 13:07.466
both trajectories
of both men's careers?

13:07.533 --> 13:08.766
[crowd chants "cero miedo"]

13:08.833 --> 13:10.400
[Vampiro]
Listen to the fans, man.

13:10.466 --> 13:12.100
I can say from experience,

13:12.733 --> 13:15.066
Pentagon Jr.
is on dark path,

13:15.133 --> 13:17.666
he's been through a lot,
he can go the distance.

13:17.733 --> 13:19.266
Man, these two young men

13:19.333 --> 13:21.700
are at the pinnacle of time
right now.

13:21.766 --> 13:23.066
What happens tonight

13:23.133 --> 13:25.233
is gonna determine tomorrow,
bro.

13:25.466 --> 13:26.766
[Santos] And his opponent,

13:27.533 --> 13:30.866
from Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico,

13:31.466 --> 13:34.600
Pentagon Jr.!

13:35.200 --> 13:36.733
[Striker]  Vampiro,
I can't think of anyone

13:36.800 --> 13:39.400
that could educate
the first-time viewer

13:39.466 --> 13:41.233
on that man, Pentagon Jr.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.433
[Vampiro]  Well, I've heard
a lot of things being said,

13:43.500 --> 13:45.866
you know, since
"you know when,"
that I'm trying to forget.

13:45.933 --> 13:47.966
But you seem to kind of
pull me back into it

13:48.033 --> 13:49.800
every time we got to talk
about him.

13:49.866 --> 13:52.533
Now, yes, passed the torch?
Maybe.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.800
Has he taken the dark path?
Definitely.

13:54.866 --> 13:57.000
Is he the right one to do that?
Hell, yeah.

13:57.066 --> 13:58.366
Will he back down? No.

13:58.433 --> 13:59.833
Will he bring it? Yes.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.700
Is he a warrior?
Definitely.

14:01.766 --> 14:03.533
Should Puma be worried?
Hell, yeah.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.866
How was that, Matt?

14:04.933 --> 14:06.766
[Striker]  That's why
you are the man.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.066
The last time
I saw these two men,

14:09.133 --> 14:11.633
Puma almost broke
Pentagon's arm,

14:11.700 --> 14:13.633
but chose not to.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.300
Perhaps
that softness of heart

14:16.366 --> 14:18.966
will come back to haunt
Prince Puma.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.900
-[bell dings]
-Referee Rick Knox
sounds the bell.

14:21.966 --> 14:23.066
Here we go.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.400
These two
were forced to team together

14:27.466 --> 14:29.166
several weeks back.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.633
Then they were in a fight
against one another.

14:31.933 --> 14:33.500
That fight
continues here tonight.

14:33.566 --> 14:37.700
[crowd chanting
"Puma! Puma!]

14:38.233 --> 14:39.500
In that match,

14:39.566 --> 14:41.866
Pentagon thought
that he defeated Puma,

14:41.933 --> 14:43.800
but Puma got his shoulders up
at the last second,

14:43.866 --> 14:47.100
so Pentagon has
a bit of motivation here.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.600
Wow.

14:51.133 --> 14:52.833
-Nice.
- [Vampiro]  Definitely.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.666
What I like most about this,
Matt,

14:54.733 --> 14:56.166
Is I feel like
I'm at your house,

14:56.233 --> 14:57.500
and we're watching wrestling,

14:57.566 --> 14:59.966
having a couple a beers
just like two best friends.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.500
I'm enjoying this so much.

15:01.566 --> 15:04.000
I wouldn't rather
hang anywhere else
except our house,

15:04.066 --> 15:05.666
which is the Temple here.

15:05.733 --> 15:07.466
Matt,
thank you for everything.

15:09.433 --> 15:10.433
Boom!
Beautiful!

15:10.500 --> 15:11.966
[Striker]  Crushing that back!

15:12.966 --> 15:15.300
[Vampiro]
That right there is a photo
for a poster.

15:15.933 --> 15:18.100
[Striker]
Now back to the wrestling.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.466
Puma on the move.

15:20.533 --> 15:22.100
Oh!

15:22.166 --> 15:25.733
Puma's knees caught Pentagon
right on the top of the head.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.300
I only pray
that Puma doesn't fall for this

15:30.366 --> 15:32.100
and he doesn't
listen to the fans too much.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.200
Pentagon is waiting.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.533
Don't forget
he's a monster.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.700
Watch out, brother.

15:36.766 --> 15:38.666
[Striker]
To your point right there,

15:38.733 --> 15:43.133
Puma wasting precious time,
locking eyes
with the believers.

15:43.866 --> 15:46.166
[Vampiro]
But then again, hey, man,
he's from Boyle Heights.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.966
He can enjoy this.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.633
[Striker]  Prince Puma. Ooh.

15:52.033 --> 15:53.566
Very close to the ropes.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.600
No. Wow.

15:56.233 --> 15:57.500
[Vampiro]
I'm telling you right now.

15:57.566 --> 16:00.366
Pentagon Jr. Is only
gonna turn it up.

16:00.566 --> 16:03.666
[Striker]  The believers are
pretty much split right
down the middle here.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.900
Oh! Ho! Ho! Ho!

16:06.300 --> 16:09.100
[Vampiro]  Excuse me
while kiss the sky.

16:09.433 --> 16:10.666
Oh, man.

16:10.733 --> 16:13.233
Talk about getting your lungs
knocked out of your ears.

16:13.633 --> 16:16.800
[Striker]
Smart kick there to
the lower rib, diaphragm area.

16:16.866 --> 16:19.200
-It makes it
very difficult to breathe.
- [Vampiro]  Look it.

16:19.666 --> 16:21.700
Focused,
not even breathing hard,

16:21.766 --> 16:24.000
taking his time
like a shark.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.633
Took the first bite,

16:25.700 --> 16:28.033
he's gonna circle around
and around and come back.

16:28.366 --> 16:30.466
Now the gloves come off.
You know what that means.

16:30.533 --> 16:33.666
[Striker]  Let's just listen
to the natural sound.

16:36.233 --> 16:38.300
[thumps, crowd "whoos"]

16:38.366 --> 16:40.433
[Vampiro]  Closest thing
to a gunshot.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.366
The auditory delight
of Pentagon.

16:44.266 --> 16:47.233
That leaves a mark
on the insides, man.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.166
That hurts so much.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.133
[Striker]
Oh, hang on a second here.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.266
Shoulders are down.

16:54.333 --> 16:55.366
No.

16:55.900 --> 16:56.833
Puma is very quick.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.500
It's Puma's quickness

16:58.566 --> 17:00.700
that may be the "x" factor
in this match.

17:00.766 --> 17:02.200
[Vampiro]
And that's his mistake.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.600
[Striker]  Ooh. Anger.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.833
[Vampiro]
He's got to learn humility,
this kid,

17:05.900 --> 17:06.966
I'm telling you.

17:07.033 --> 17:08.466
As soon as he starts
yelling at the referee,

17:08.533 --> 17:09.633
he loses focus.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.066
[Striker]
Talking about Pentagon Jr.,

17:11.133 --> 17:13.933
who now is caught
in the clutches of Prince Puma.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.966
We've seen this
from Puma before,

17:16.333 --> 17:18.533
showing his power,
his core strength.

17:18.933 --> 17:20.700
Should have went
for a pin there, no?

17:20.766 --> 17:22.466
[Vampiro]
I would have to say "yes"...

17:22.533 --> 17:24.366
-[Striker] He'd rather go
for that.
-...Being Prince Puma.

17:25.433 --> 17:28.033
[Vampiro]  Too worried about
being a video game,
go for the win.

17:28.099 --> 17:30.533
But Puma's got--
he's pissed off.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.700
He's gonna fight.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.666
[Striker]
Well, I think Pentagon
is very smart--

17:37.733 --> 17:39.333
Coming up onto all fours,

17:39.400 --> 17:40.566
keeping his shoulders
off the mat.

17:40.633 --> 17:42.066
It tells me as an analyst

17:42.133 --> 17:44.966
that Pentagon has
a lot of fight and
wherewithal left in him.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.133
[Vampiro]
You think Pentagon's plan?

17:47.666 --> 17:50.566
[Striker] I just believe
that his instincts
are in a good place.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.933
-In a good place?
-May be coming
right out of his body

17:54.000 --> 17:56.133
right now, though,
if Puma can hit this.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.033
No,
Puma lands on his feet.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.933
A lot space
between the two fighters now.

18:00.066 --> 18:01.400
Pentagon
goes to make it up.

18:01.466 --> 18:03.200
Puma catches,
puts him on the turnbuckle,

18:03.266 --> 18:05.266
and slaps the taste
out of his mouth.

18:07.266 --> 18:08.366
[Vampiro]  Matt.

18:08.433 --> 18:09.666
Matt.

18:10.266 --> 18:12.733
Look at
the top of the Temple.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.366
It's our champion
Mil Muertes...

18:16.433 --> 18:20.400
descending the steps
of the Temple slowly...

18:21.066 --> 18:22.533
- [Striker]  Cover here!
-Watching these two.

18:22.766 --> 18:25.933
[Striker]
No! Mexican destroyer
from Pentagon was not enough.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.633
And there is our
Lucha Underground champion,

18:29.700 --> 18:33.133
Dark Destro himself,
Mil Muertes.

18:33.933 --> 18:35.200
[Vampiro]  This is too much.

18:35.933 --> 18:38.200
You got violence
all around you.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.266
I feel like
a kid at Christmas time.

18:40.466 --> 18:43.533
[Striker]
Of course the broken arm,
a product of Pentagon.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.866
[crowd chants "cero miedo"]

18:44.933 --> 18:47.066
So Mil has that beef
with Pentagon.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.200
Mil defeated Puma
for the title.

18:49.266 --> 18:50.666
- [Vampiro]  Wait a second.
-There's that beef.

18:50.733 --> 18:52.200
[Striker]
And the sling just came off.

18:52.433 --> 18:55.466
I can only assume
that the champion
is fully healed.

18:55.866 --> 18:57.666
Mil is furious.

18:57.733 --> 18:59.233
Mil is pissed.

18:59.300 --> 19:03.433
[crowd chanting
"Mil Muertes!"]

19:03.500 --> 19:05.900
[Striker]
I don't think Pentagon
even realizes

19:06.200 --> 19:08.300
the presence of death
behind him

19:08.366 --> 19:10.166
as he hooks Puma up for
the package piledriver.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.400
[Vampiro]
Oh, yeah, turn around.

19:11.466 --> 19:13.533
[Striker]
Now Pentagon notices.

19:14.566 --> 19:15.833
Ooh.

19:16.033 --> 19:17.733
-Hang on.
-[bell dinging]

19:18.300 --> 19:20.633
Contact made.
Outside interference.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.800
Referee calls
for the disqualification.

19:22.866 --> 19:24.600
Ooh!

19:25.700 --> 19:26.833
[Vampiro]  Bad move.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.000
Oh. Ouch.
Straight right hand.

19:30.066 --> 19:31.366
Spear.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.766
Our champion
looks dominant right now,

19:34.833 --> 19:37.933
taking out
what may very well be

19:38.000 --> 19:41.133
his two most dangerous
challengers.

19:41.966 --> 19:47.633
[Vampiro]
Matt, when has Mil Muertes
not looked devastating?

19:48.900 --> 19:51.066
[bell dinging]

19:52.633 --> 19:55.033
[Striker]
If you're gonna break
Mil Muertes' arm,

19:55.833 --> 19:57.933
you better be ready
for the repercussions.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.866
Double flatliner!

20:01.200 --> 20:04.233
[theme music plays]

20:05.833 --> 20:09.066
[Vampiro]
I'm sorry to say it,
the champ is home.

20:09.466 --> 20:12.166
[Striker]
This is the Lucha Underground
champion.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.033
This is his Temple.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.833
Mil Muertes looks
as if he's fully healed

20:16.900 --> 20:18.600
and out for some revenge

20:18.666 --> 20:20.566
against Puma and Pentagon.

20:20.633 --> 20:22.433
The champion
has made a statement tonight.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.900
And, Vamp, it's hard to imagine
that his title is safe

20:25.966 --> 20:28.500
from either Puma or Pentagon

20:28.800 --> 20:31.533
or the two men
competing in our main event.

20:31.833 --> 20:34.300
We're talking about
Fenix and King Cuerno.

20:34.366 --> 20:37.366
It's a Gift of the Gods
ladder match.

20:37.433 --> 20:40.200
Carnage, destruction,
violence

20:40.266 --> 20:43.900
when we come back
here on "Lucha Underground."

20:44.200 --> 20:45.600
[Vampiro]  I'm sorry to say it,
brother,

20:45.700 --> 20:48.900
But that title looks
pretty safe to me
right about now.

21:04.933 --> 21:06.100
See?

21:06.166 --> 21:08.500
All you needed
was a little motivation.

21:09.066 --> 21:11.733
What I did tonight
was nothing.

21:11.800 --> 21:15.066
Next week,
I will defend my Championship

21:15.133 --> 21:16.800
against both of them.

21:16.866 --> 21:20.366
This is my Temple.

21:22.266 --> 21:25.200
And no one can stop

21:26.800 --> 21:28.800
Mil Muertes.

21:29.766 --> 21:31.233
[exhales deeply]

21:33.600 --> 21:34.733
[chuckles]

21:37.366 --> 21:40.233
[crowd chanting "lucha"]

21:40.300 --> 21:41.266
[Striker]
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:41.333 --> 21:43.033
welcome back
to "Lucha Underground."

21:43.100 --> 21:45.133
We are moments away
from our main event

21:45.200 --> 21:47.300
for the Gift of the Gods
Championship,

21:47.366 --> 21:48.833
Fenix versus King Cuerno.

21:48.900 --> 21:49.900
But before we get there,

21:49.966 --> 21:52.633
we have breaking news
that we can announce
for you right now.

21:52.933 --> 21:54.600
The invitations
have been sent out

21:54.666 --> 21:56.566
by Mil Muertes and Catrina.

21:56.633 --> 21:57.900
In three short weeks,

21:57.966 --> 22:01.000
20 of the greatest fighters
in the world

22:01.066 --> 22:04.633
will converge on this Temple
for Aztec Warfare.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.400
Now,
the rules are simple.

22:06.466 --> 22:08.233
Two luchadores
will start the match.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.900
Every 90 seconds,
a new luchador will enter.

22:10.966 --> 22:12.633
The only way to be eliminated

22:12.700 --> 22:15.100
is by pinfall or submission.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.666
Whomever is
the last luchador left

22:17.733 --> 22:21.066
will then earn
the number-1 contender spot

22:21.133 --> 22:24.266
to Mil Muertes'
Lucha Underground Championship.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.600
Last year's Aztec Warfare
was groundbreaking.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.866
This year's promises
to be darker, more disturbed,

22:31.933 --> 22:33.233
and even more violent.

22:33.300 --> 22:34.866
In three short weeks,

22:34.933 --> 22:37.000
Aztec Warfare comes your way

22:37.066 --> 22:39.433
Right here
on "Lucha Underground."

22:40.433 --> 22:43.700
[crowd cheers]

22:44.033 --> 22:45.433
[bell dings]

22:45.500 --> 22:48.366
The following lucha
is the main event

22:48.433 --> 22:51.800
and is for the Gift of the Gods
Championship.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.833
The only way to win

22:54.900 --> 22:57.466
is be the first luchador
to climb the ladder

22:57.533 --> 22:59.966
and retrieve
the Gift of the Gods.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.100
Introducing first,
the challenger.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.333
From Mexico city, Mexico,

23:05.833 --> 23:07.800
Fenix.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.800
[Striker]
This young man is a former
Gift of the Gods champion.

23:11.866 --> 23:14.666
This young man
has Aztec Warfare experience,

23:14.733 --> 23:16.400
and in the last year,

23:16.466 --> 23:20.266
this young man
has absolutely electrified

23:20.333 --> 23:21.633
the wrestling world.

23:21.700 --> 23:22.866
We are talking about Fenix,

23:22.933 --> 23:25.200
but Vamp,
you told me off the air

23:25.266 --> 23:27.133
that you think
this type of match

23:27.200 --> 23:29.533
-could end
this young man's career.
-[Vampiro] Exactly, Matt.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.033
You said he's done
all those things,

23:31.100 --> 23:33.500
but stepped
into the face death.

23:33.566 --> 23:35.233
This is a different
kind of match.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.666
You're coming out of this match
beaten up, hurt,

23:37.733 --> 23:39.000
maybe you might be
carried out.

23:39.066 --> 23:40.166
This is something different.

23:40.233 --> 23:41.933
There are no applause
in this arena

23:42.000 --> 23:43.866
that's gonna get you
through this easily.

23:43.933 --> 23:47.266
[Striker] Well, this young man
did survive grave
consequences.

23:47.466 --> 23:49.866
Can he survive
a ladder match

23:50.266 --> 23:52.400
for the Gift of the Gods
Championship.

23:52.466 --> 23:55.066
If you've never seen
a ladder match before,

23:55.133 --> 23:57.233
let your imagination run wild

23:57.300 --> 24:00.666
with the things
that these athletes will do.

24:00.733 --> 24:02.433
[Vampiro]  Is that fear?
Is that adrenaline?

24:02.500 --> 24:04.666
-Is that confidence?
- [Striker]  That's just Fenix.

24:04.733 --> 24:07.366
[Vampiro]  That's just Fenix.
Good call.

24:07.433 --> 24:09.900
[theme music plays]

24:09.966 --> 24:12.366
Hey, man,
what would you do

24:12.433 --> 24:14.000
walking down the stairs
of the Temple

24:14.066 --> 24:16.600
knowing no matter
what you do tonight,

24:17.000 --> 24:18.266
your career could end?

24:20.700 --> 24:22.133
And his opponent,

24:22.666 --> 24:25.266
from the highlands
of Guerrero, Mexico,

24:25.600 --> 24:28.200
he is the Gift of the Gods
champion,

24:28.433 --> 24:31.900
King Cuerno!

24:32.200 --> 24:34.700
[Striker]
Last year at Ultima Lucha,

24:34.766 --> 24:37.533
Fenix won the Gift of the Gods
Championship.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.200
A mere six weeks ago,

24:39.266 --> 24:40.966
he lost that coveted title

24:41.033 --> 24:43.633
to the man that is about
to enter the Temple.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.133
He is known as "the hunter."

24:45.200 --> 24:48.600
He is known as the surveyor
of all that he sees.

24:48.666 --> 24:51.233
He is indeed
the Gift of the Gods champion,

24:51.300 --> 24:52.400
King Cuerno.

24:55.766 --> 24:57.400
Now, Vamp,
in this type of match,

24:57.466 --> 24:59.700
you need to incapacitate
your opponent enough

24:59.766 --> 25:02.866
for you to climb a ladder
and unhinge the Championship

25:02.933 --> 25:05.500
that hangs perilously high
above the ring.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.366
Who do you give
the advantage to?

25:08.433 --> 25:09.733
- [Vampiro]  Definitely Cuerno.
-Why?

25:09.800 --> 25:13.200
He's played Fenix into this
like a mouse in a trap, bro.

25:13.266 --> 25:14.566
You got to remember--

25:14.633 --> 25:16.300
In order to get that belt
up there,

25:16.366 --> 25:18.366
you're gonna have to be willing
to almost die.

25:18.433 --> 25:19.900
In order to do that,

25:19.966 --> 25:22.800
is he willing to go the step
and maybe even kill someone?

25:22.866 --> 25:24.766
I don't think so.
It's that serious.

25:24.833 --> 25:26.066
That's what's on the line.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.400
[Striker]
Both of these men

25:27.466 --> 25:29.733
own victories
over one another.

25:29.933 --> 25:32.733
You have to believe that
that's going through
their mind.

25:33.033 --> 25:35.300
There you see the empty throne

25:35.666 --> 25:38.233
of our Lucha Underground
champion, Mil Muertes.

25:38.300 --> 25:41.133
This match
has direct implications

25:41.200 --> 25:43.166
on Mil Muertes'
title reign.

25:44.233 --> 25:46.466
[Vampiro]  Speaking of,
here comes our champion.

25:46.533 --> 25:48.266
Mil Muertes in his throne,

25:48.600 --> 25:49.900
overlooking the Temple

25:49.966 --> 25:51.833
like an overlord
of the dark world.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.233
I'm so much digging that.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.733
-What?
- [Striker]  Ladies
and gentlemen,

25:54.800 --> 25:56.900
when we return
here on "Lucha Underground,"

25:56.966 --> 25:59.533
"The hunter" takes on
"the bird of war"
in a ladder match

25:59.600 --> 26:02.466
with the Gift of the Gods
Championship on the line.

26:02.533 --> 26:04.466
That Championship
guarantees its holder

26:04.533 --> 26:06.566
a Lucha Underground
Championship match.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.233
These two fighters
will have to do

26:08.300 --> 26:09.300
anything and everything

26:09.366 --> 26:10.400
in order
to climb that ladder

26:10.466 --> 26:12.066
and be the first
to retrieve the title.

26:12.133 --> 26:13.633
This one
should be a classic.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.200
Fenix, King Cuerno,

26:15.266 --> 26:16.733
Gift of the Gods
ladder match.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.866
It happens next.

26:21.300 --> 26:22.733
[Striker]  Welcome back
to "Lucha Underground."

26:22.800 --> 26:25.600
It's main event time.
Here we go.

26:26.033 --> 26:27.366
[bell dings]

26:27.866 --> 26:29.833
[Vampiro]  Cuerno not even
paying attention to Fenix.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.133
He's looking up
at that belt.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.766
He knows
what he's got to do.

26:33.100 --> 26:35.500
[Striker]  I asked you
to whom you give the advantage.

26:35.566 --> 26:37.833
-You gave it to Cuerno.
-Yep.

26:38.033 --> 26:41.000
[Striker]
Fenix busting out some
unique offense from the start.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.133
[Vampiro]  Hey, man,
with a match like this,

26:43.200 --> 26:44.533
where you're gonna get
an ass whupping,

26:44.600 --> 26:46.400
you better be careful
with that high-flying stuff.

26:46.466 --> 26:48.300
It'll take its toll
before it needs to.

26:48.366 --> 26:49.900
[Striker]  Now, these two
know each other very well.

26:49.966 --> 26:51.733
They know they're gonna have
to wear each other down

26:51.800 --> 26:54.133
before they go
to incapacitate one another.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.166
Although,
Fenix looks like he's ready

26:56.233 --> 26:57.733
to pull out his ace card
right away.

26:57.800 --> 26:58.900
[Vampiro]
I think Fenix has got

26:58.966 --> 27:00.466
a little bit of aggression
in him tonight.

27:00.533 --> 27:02.400
He looks like
he hates Cuerno.

27:04.366 --> 27:06.866
[Striker]
Well, they do say
familiarity breeds contempt.

27:09.133 --> 27:11.933
The steel jungle
that Cuerno lords over.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.700
Fenix flies
from the skies!

27:15.233 --> 27:19.800
[crowd chants "lucha"]

27:20.433 --> 27:23.033
[Vampiro]
Would you go for the victory
early on something like this?

27:23.100 --> 27:24.300
Well, it's something
to point out.

27:24.366 --> 27:25.500
All of the ladders,

27:25.566 --> 27:28.533
all of your tools
are outside of the ring.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.766
Therefore, it behooves you
to take the fight outside,

27:31.833 --> 27:34.833
incapacitate your opponent,
and start to maneuver in.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.866
That's what Fenix
is doing early on.

27:38.266 --> 27:39.466
Ooh, god.

27:41.833 --> 27:44.166
Well, this may be easier
than we thought.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.366
Fenix is setting up
the ladder.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.166
The placement of the ladder
is crucial.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.133
Fenix. Fenix.

28:00.966 --> 28:02.300
Cuerno in.

28:02.466 --> 28:05.033
-[Vampiro] Cuerno smart.
-Fenix down.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.266
[Vampiro]
Two weeks ago, these two guys

28:06.333 --> 28:08.500
had to beat the living hell
out of each other, Matt.

28:08.566 --> 28:09.666
Well, you remember that.

28:10.233 --> 28:11.466
Hatred.

28:11.533 --> 28:13.300
I don't even think
they had time to heal up.

28:14.633 --> 28:17.066
[Striker]  Adrenaline
is a wonderful thing
in our sport.

28:17.133 --> 28:18.700
[Vampiro]
It's my favorite drug.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.233
Built a career on it,
you know.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.200
[Striker]
Now, Cuerno could have opted
to use the ladder there,

28:25.266 --> 28:26.733
but instead,
it looks like Cuerno's

28:26.800 --> 28:29.666
gonna use the ladder
for offense against Fenix,

28:29.733 --> 28:31.733
-which is all legal,
by the way.
-Sure it is.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.133
[Vampiro]
And this ain't home depot.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.633
You see,
this is the Temple, man.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.333
These are full of
all kind of vermin.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.033
It's dirty,
you get cut, hurt,

28:39.100 --> 28:41.300
and blood and guts,
and all that kind of stuff.

28:42.666 --> 28:44.833
[Striker]
Powerbomb onto the ladder.

28:44.900 --> 28:46.066
[Vampiro]  Nasty.

28:46.900 --> 28:49.933
[applause]

28:50.000 --> 28:51.466
I like when Cuerno
does that, man.

28:51.533 --> 28:52.733
He just takes his time.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.733
Just like, "you really,
really want to do this?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.200
Do you really
want to push me?"

28:56.266 --> 28:57.466
[crowd chants "Cuerno"]

28:57.533 --> 29:00.900
[Striker]  As Cuerno drags
his hand along the
perimeter of the ring,

29:00.966 --> 29:02.900
the hunter now outside.

29:02.966 --> 29:04.000
[Vampiro]
I can't understand it.

29:04.066 --> 29:05.200
He's got the ladder
in the ring.

29:05.266 --> 29:06.300
I can't understand

29:06.366 --> 29:08.600
why they don't go
for the kill, man.

29:08.666 --> 29:10.700
I understand
that he likes the trophy.

29:10.766 --> 29:12.066
I understand he likes
the thrill of the hunt.

29:12.266 --> 29:13.433
I get it.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.766
Ulterior motives?

29:15.266 --> 29:16.833
[Striker]  Speculation.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.100
What is Cuerno building here?

29:21.766 --> 29:23.033
[Vampiro]
Well, I don't know, man,

29:23.100 --> 29:25.400
but he can't leave Fenix out
too long before he recoups.

29:25.466 --> 29:27.266
You got to remember
he's a warrior, bro.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.333
[Striker]  Perhaps a steel altar

29:29.400 --> 29:31.766
on which Fenix
will be sacrificed.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.366
[Vampiro]
Yeah, you can feel it
in the Temple,

29:37.433 --> 29:38.266
like, mice running around.

29:38.333 --> 29:39.766
Everybody's feet,
standing up.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.833
Everybody wants to watch
the beating.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.300
Sick.

29:45.433 --> 29:48.533
[Striker]
Block there by Fenix,
dropping down to a knee.

29:51.866 --> 29:54.033
Fenix still kicking.

29:54.866 --> 29:56.700
Putting his weight
on the bottom half of his body

29:56.766 --> 29:59.200
makes it difficult for Cuerno
to get Fenix up.

29:59.833 --> 30:00.933
Ooh.

30:02.066 --> 30:03.566
You know, it's interesting.

30:03.633 --> 30:06.033
Cuerno sensed that there
was still a lot of strength
and fight in Fenix

30:06.100 --> 30:08.566
and knew that he had to inflict
more punishment.

30:08.633 --> 30:10.133
We've talked about it
week in and week out

30:10.200 --> 30:13.366
about how cerebral,
how psychological Cuerno is.

30:13.433 --> 30:15.433
That was very smart
in my opinion.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.566
[Vampiro]  Psychological?

30:17.633 --> 30:19.266
How about psychotic?

30:20.966 --> 30:22.300
Ooh!

30:29.133 --> 30:30.533
Maybe like a mouse
in a trap here,

30:30.600 --> 30:32.166
he's setting the bait?

30:33.500 --> 30:34.800
What's he doing?

30:36.100 --> 30:38.133
[Striker]
That is Catrina's office.

30:38.633 --> 30:40.633
I'm sure Cuerno
would love for Catrina

30:40.700 --> 30:44.366
to hear the thumps and thuds
of bodily harm.

30:44.766 --> 30:47.600
[crowd chants
"Cuerno! Cuerno!"]

30:47.666 --> 30:48.966
- [Vampiro]  He wants--
-Let's not forget

30:49.033 --> 30:50.600
in the last luchador standing
match...

30:50.666 --> 30:52.266
This is deja vu
right here,

30:52.333 --> 30:54.433
and it ended up
biting Cuerno in the ass.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.100
[Fenix screams]

30:59.833 --> 31:00.900
[Vampiro]  That's got to hurt.

31:00.966 --> 31:03.066
[Striker]  You can hear those
primal screams from Fenix.

31:03.133 --> 31:05.533
-Oh.
- [Vampiro]  That's got to hurt.

31:07.633 --> 31:08.833
[crowd chants
"let's go, Cuerno"]

31:08.900 --> 31:10.400
[crowd chants
"let's go, Fenix"]

31:10.466 --> 31:11.566
[crowd chants
"let's go, Cuerno"]

31:11.633 --> 31:12.733
[crowd chants
"let's go, Fenix"]

31:12.800 --> 31:14.633
[Vampiro]  We've been waiting
for this.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.366
It was
only a matter of time

31:16.433 --> 31:18.000
before the faithful
in the Temple woke up.

31:18.066 --> 31:19.200
[crowd chants
"let's go, Fenix"]

31:19.266 --> 31:20.433
[crowd chants
"let's go, Cuerno"]

31:20.500 --> 31:22.666
[Striker]  Fenix can't even
get to his feet.

31:22.733 --> 31:24.066
[crowd chants
"let's go, Cuerno"]

31:24.133 --> 31:26.333
[crowd chants
"let's go, Fenix"]

31:26.400 --> 31:29.266
Cuerno now
with the elephant gun,

31:29.900 --> 31:31.866
seeking his prey.

31:33.966 --> 31:36.766
[Vampiro]  Man, he's got Fenix
where he wants him.

31:36.833 --> 31:39.466
I don't understand
his methodology here.

31:40.866 --> 31:44.400
[Striker]  Slowly placing
the ladder down,
Cuerno creeps.

31:47.033 --> 31:48.600
[crowd "ohhs"]

31:48.666 --> 31:51.400
[Vampiro]
That football kick to ribs
just about did it for me.

31:51.866 --> 31:53.066
He's done.

31:55.433 --> 31:56.433
[Striker]  Hold on here,

31:56.500 --> 31:58.933
as we look through
the steel ladder.

31:59.166 --> 32:00.866
Someone's coming your way.

32:00.933 --> 32:02.233
Ooh, the agility.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.133
Nicely done by Cuerno.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.933
[applause]

32:06.400 --> 32:07.766
[Vampiro]  Very smart.

32:07.833 --> 32:10.833
[Striker]
This may very well be
our next challenger

32:10.900 --> 32:12.700
for the Lucha Underground
Championship.

32:12.766 --> 32:14.566
And I think Cuerno is at
the height of his game.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.033
[Vampiro]  I think that Fenix
is just desperate,
trying to reverse,

32:17.100 --> 32:18.133
trying to do anything
to hang on.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.966
Cuerno's fresh.
He's too smart.

32:20.033 --> 32:21.800
He's aware of it.
He sees it like "the matrix."

32:21.866 --> 32:22.866
He just took his time,

32:22.933 --> 32:24.866
knocked him
off his feet again.

32:27.366 --> 32:29.600
[crowd "ohhs"]

32:31.300 --> 32:33.366
I know that corner
all too well.

32:33.433 --> 32:35.700
[Striker]  Into the sea
of believers.

32:35.766 --> 32:40.166
[crowd chants "lucha"]

32:40.233 --> 32:41.633
-Vamp?
-Yeah.

32:42.066 --> 32:45.400
Earlier, you said Cuerno
should just go for the title.

32:45.466 --> 32:47.266
But now Cuerno
is using his environment

32:47.333 --> 32:49.866
to try to truly incapacitate
his opponent.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.900
Is this a smart strategy?

32:55.500 --> 32:58.300
[Vampiro]
I think he's on a mission
to destroy Fenix.

32:58.366 --> 32:59.500
This isn't a tactic.

32:59.566 --> 33:01.900
This is hate. This is hurt.

33:02.333 --> 33:03.733
This isn't about win.

33:04.266 --> 33:05.766
He's hurting him.

33:11.133 --> 33:13.000
He's got him
where he wants him,
wouldn't you say?

33:15.400 --> 33:17.333
[Striker]  I would,
but maybe Cuerno knows Fenix

33:17.400 --> 33:18.866
better than you and I do

33:18.933 --> 33:20.466
sitting behind this table.

33:20.533 --> 33:22.033
Cuerno has fought Fenix.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.833
He understands what kind of man
is underneath that mask.

33:26.266 --> 33:27.866
And perhaps this tells you

33:27.933 --> 33:30.400
how much Cuerno
truly fears Fenix,

33:30.466 --> 33:32.400
how much Cuerno
respects Fenix,

33:32.466 --> 33:34.900
how much Cuerno
wants to end Fenix.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.833
[Vampiro]  It just shows
how much Cuerno

33:36.900 --> 33:39.066
is a hunter
toying with his game

33:39.133 --> 33:40.400
before he kills it.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.133
Don't you think?

33:42.966 --> 33:44.933
[Striker]  High above
the canopy here.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.800
Cuerno has Fenix
hooked up.

33:48.133 --> 33:50.366
-[Vampiro]  Whoa.
-Only one place to go.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.800
[Striker]  Fenix now
rising from the ashes,

34:02.866 --> 34:04.933
still has some fight
left in him.

34:05.233 --> 34:07.300
We talked about
this young man's tenacity.

34:07.366 --> 34:09.100
We talked about
this young man's ability,

34:09.166 --> 34:10.533
but how about his heart?

34:10.600 --> 34:12.166
What does Fenix have left?

34:12.233 --> 34:15.266
[crowd clapping rhythmically]

34:17.199 --> 34:20.633
-[crowd "ohhs]
- [Vampiro]  Oh!

34:23.300 --> 34:25.666
Damn. I'm standing up.

34:25.733 --> 34:28.033
[crowd chants "holy shit"]

34:28.100 --> 34:31.133
[crowd chants
"this is awesome"]

34:32.333 --> 34:35.533
[Striker]
But now it begs the question,
at what price?

34:36.166 --> 34:38.233
How much did Fenix
have to exert

34:38.300 --> 34:40.800
to pull
that amazing maneuver off?

34:40.866 --> 34:42.500
[Vampiro]  You really think
with the hatred involved,

34:42.566 --> 34:44.533
they're even thinking
about that belt right now,

34:44.600 --> 34:46.199
-honestly?
-Yes, I do believe

34:46.266 --> 34:48.133
that in the back
of their minds,

34:48.199 --> 34:49.966
the Gift of the Gods
Championship

34:50.033 --> 34:53.166
is an extremely valuable prize
to both of these fighters.

34:53.233 --> 34:54.966
They wouldn't be putting
their careers on the line

34:55.033 --> 34:56.066
if it were not.

34:59.033 --> 35:00.900
[Vampiro]
Do you agree with me,
when this match is done,

35:01.200 --> 35:03.500
both of these men
are never gonna be
the same again?

35:03.566 --> 35:05.000
[Striker]  100%.

35:07.033 --> 35:09.600
Because one of them
will be in line

35:09.666 --> 35:11.900
for the Lucha Underground
Championship.

35:11.966 --> 35:15.166
The other must go back
and re-evaluate their career

35:15.233 --> 35:16.400
here in the Temple.

35:19.500 --> 35:22.433
[Vampiro] I think the mental
and emotional scar tissue

35:22.500 --> 35:23.533
that's gonna be here

35:23.600 --> 35:25.300
is gonna be causing
some serious

35:25.366 --> 35:27.833
Post traumatic stress disorder,
brother.

35:30.566 --> 35:31.766
[Striker]
Fighting into the crowd.

35:31.833 --> 35:33.633
If you can get
to Boyle Heights, Los Angeles,

35:33.700 --> 35:34.866
come down to the Temple

35:34.933 --> 35:37.633
and experience
Lucha Underground firsthand

35:37.700 --> 35:38.966
like that guy.

35:39.033 --> 35:40.366
[crowd chants
"let's go, Fenix"]

35:40.433 --> 35:41.500
[crowd chants
"let's go, Cuerno"]

35:41.566 --> 35:43.066
[Vampiro]  Dude...

35:43.133 --> 35:44.500
But do it at your own risk,
man.

35:44.566 --> 35:45.900
[crowd chants
"let's go, Fenix"]

35:45.966 --> 35:47.466
[crowd chants
"let's go, Cuerno"]

35:47.533 --> 35:48.700
[crowd chants
"let's go, Fenix"]

35:48.766 --> 35:50.633
[crowd chants
"let's go, Cuerno"]

35:51.200 --> 35:52.266
I'm sorry to say it,

35:52.333 --> 35:54.500
but the fans in Boyle Heights,
kind of gruesome.

35:54.566 --> 35:56.033
They like blood.

35:57.966 --> 36:01.333
[Striker]
It's a special kind of fan
here at Lucha Underground.

36:01.566 --> 36:04.333
[Vampiro]  Yeah, tattooed,
rock 'n' roll,
criminal-esque.

36:04.666 --> 36:05.900
What are you trying to say?

36:07.700 --> 36:10.733
[Striker]  A unique breed.
There you go.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.933
Not just the fans,
but the fighters, as well,

36:13.000 --> 36:14.833
and the lengths
that they will go.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.133
Now that Aztec Warfare
has been announced,

36:18.200 --> 36:21.733
I do believe
that the locker room intensity

36:21.800 --> 36:24.266
will certainly
have to be on high alert.

36:24.333 --> 36:25.600
Oh, god!

36:26.800 --> 36:29.833
[Vampiro]
That head just about
came through my monitor.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.566
He's got to go.

36:35.633 --> 36:37.200
You got to go, man.

36:39.300 --> 36:42.133
[Striker]  Fenix realizes
that Cuerno is trapped.

36:43.733 --> 36:45.333
Oh!

36:50.466 --> 36:51.866
[Vampiro]  He broke his ass.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.100
[Striker]  And with a bum leg,

37:02.766 --> 37:04.166
you have to believe now

37:04.233 --> 37:06.266
that Fenix
is behind the eight ball.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.500
If Cuerno can smell
the blood in the water,

37:10.466 --> 37:11.966
this match maybe over.

37:14.133 --> 37:15.566
Oh.

37:15.866 --> 37:18.166
[Vampiro]  Damn, damn,
damn, man.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.733
This is some serious
five-star hate beating

37:24.800 --> 37:26.200
that I'm seeing
right here.

37:26.266 --> 37:27.766
[Striker]  Fenix
is a wounded animal.

37:27.833 --> 37:29.100
The hunter
going for the kill.

37:29.166 --> 37:30.666
Oh!

37:32.866 --> 37:36.133
The ladder reverbed
off the steel post,

37:36.200 --> 37:39.600
and it ended up sticking Cuerno
in his right arm.

37:39.666 --> 37:41.733
He's clutching
his bicep right now.

37:43.633 --> 37:46.133
[Vampiro]  Matt, Matt,
will either of these two guys

37:46.200 --> 37:48.166
even be able
to win this match?

37:49.033 --> 37:50.366
[Striker]  Someone has to.

37:53.933 --> 37:55.200
Oh!

37:56.500 --> 37:58.200
[applause]

37:58.733 --> 38:00.933
[Vampiro]  I can't-- I can't--
I can't take it.

38:02.066 --> 38:05.333
Fenix is just rising
from the flames once again.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.000
[Striker]  Yeah, we alluded
to it earlier.

38:07.066 --> 38:08.100
This is exactly where

38:08.166 --> 38:10.800
the last luchador
standing match ended.

38:10.866 --> 38:12.766
[crowd chants "Fenix"]

38:12.966 --> 38:15.633
Perfect poetic justice
here for Fenix

38:16.333 --> 38:20.366
as the bird of war
ascends high above the Temple.

38:20.633 --> 38:21.933
The hunter is up.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.433
[Vampiro] Whoop !

38:25.500 --> 38:26.800
Oh!

38:27.500 --> 38:28.500
Jesus.

38:29.666 --> 38:30.766
Well,
I'm looking at the fans,

38:30.833 --> 38:32.166
and everybody's starting
to get freaked out here.

38:32.233 --> 38:34.633
This is a little
bit too violent,
even for my taste.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.666
[Striker]  No such thing
here at the Temple.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.800
And your tastes?
Come on.

38:39.866 --> 38:41.600
[Vampiro]
Okay, I just told a lie.

38:41.666 --> 38:43.866
But still,
you know what I'm saying?

38:44.900 --> 38:46.266
-Finally.
- [Striker]  Here we go now.

38:46.333 --> 38:47.900
Cuerno setting up
the ladder.

38:47.966 --> 38:49.600
Let's not forget
the objective of this match:

38:49.666 --> 38:50.966
Climb the ladder

38:51.033 --> 38:53.400
and unhook the Gift of the Gods
Championship,

38:53.466 --> 38:55.033
and you are victorious.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.733
[Vampiro]
I just don't understand it.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.133
I don't understand it.

38:59.433 --> 39:01.033
[crowd chants
"let's go, Cuerno"]

39:01.100 --> 39:02.100
[crowd chants
"let's go, Fenix"]

39:02.166 --> 39:03.333
[Striker]
Don't understand what?

39:03.400 --> 39:05.400
[Vampiro]
Man, then again, I do
'cause I've been there.

39:05.466 --> 39:07.566
-I just hate to see it...
- [Striker]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:07.633 --> 39:08.666
Oh!

39:09.766 --> 39:11.666
[Vampiro]  ...When hate
takes over.

39:13.466 --> 39:15.766
[Striker]
We've talked about hatred.
We've talked about pride.

39:15.833 --> 39:17.800
We've talked about
all these emotions,

39:17.866 --> 39:19.133
but at the end
of the day,

39:19.200 --> 39:22.366
it's about becoming
the Lucha Underground champion.

39:22.433 --> 39:24.133
And that's what these two
are fighting for.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.500
[Vampiro]
Well, and I will say it now,
and I know you agree with me.

39:26.566 --> 39:28.133
I would just give the belt
to both of them,

39:28.200 --> 39:29.533
but I hate to see this.
You know what I mean?

39:29.600 --> 39:32.133
Unfortunately, one has to
go home empty-handed.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.700
[Striker]  Yeah, that's now
how we do things here.

39:33.766 --> 39:35.533
[crowd chants
"this is awesome"]

39:35.600 --> 39:38.166
And throughout all this carnage
and all this destruction,

39:38.233 --> 39:40.266
you have to believe
that Mil Muertes

39:40.333 --> 39:41.866
must be enjoying this.

39:43.566 --> 39:46.366
-[Vampiro] Is he enjoying it?
-Sure, why not?

39:46.433 --> 39:49.500
-His two, perhaps,
greatest rivals...
-[Vampiro] Oh, no.

39:49.566 --> 39:51.300
are just destroying
one another.

39:51.366 --> 39:55.033
We just saw Puma and Pentagon
do the same to each other.

39:55.333 --> 39:58.233
It looks pretty rosy for
the Lucha Underground champion.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.466
So, close.

40:02.533 --> 40:03.866
Oh, boy!

40:06.033 --> 40:07.466
[Vampiro]  What the hell
are we seeing?

40:07.533 --> 40:10.633
[Striker]  The expressions
of the believers
tell a story!

40:12.433 --> 40:13.933
[Vampiro]  Damn!

40:15.300 --> 40:16.700
I got to go.

40:16.766 --> 40:19.633
[Striker]  As Vampiro
joins the believers,

40:19.700 --> 40:21.900
both fighters
flat on their back

40:22.333 --> 40:24.666
as far way from their goal
and objective

40:24.733 --> 40:26.533
as they could possibly be.

40:31.066 --> 40:33.000
Cuerno,
the first to his feet.

40:33.533 --> 40:36.266
He has enjoyed most of
the offense in this match.

40:36.333 --> 40:37.833
And look at that look.

40:38.166 --> 40:40.100
That's a look of respect.

40:47.266 --> 40:49.133
[Vampiro]  Thrill of the hunt
position.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.966
There it is.

40:53.966 --> 40:55.466
His plan almost backfired,

40:55.533 --> 40:57.133
would it be safe
to say on this one?

40:57.200 --> 40:59.000
[Striker]  Well,
we have to wait and see.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.566
[Vampiro]  I mean,
he had to have known

41:02.633 --> 41:04.400
that Fenix
was not gonna lie down.

41:04.466 --> 41:07.566
[Striker]
Well, very few get up from
the thrill of the hunt.

41:07.933 --> 41:10.500
Fenix in the corner
of the ring.

41:10.566 --> 41:11.833
[Vampiro]
Very few get up from
getting their head

41:11.900 --> 41:14.266
beaten through the floor
with a ladder, Matt.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.966
[Striker]  Every good hunter
wants to go for the kill.

41:23.366 --> 41:25.100
And that seems to be

41:25.166 --> 41:29.400
what Cuerno has running through
his sick, twisted mind.

41:29.966 --> 41:31.133
[Vampiro]  Cuerno?

41:31.200 --> 41:33.333
How about these fans
and their sick, twisted mind

41:33.400 --> 41:34.700
calling for a table?

41:34.766 --> 41:36.400
You see the tables,
and all of a sudden,

41:36.466 --> 41:38.500
standing ovation
for the violence.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.200
I want to invite
every single one of them

41:41.266 --> 41:42.900
to my next
birthday party.

41:43.333 --> 41:46.366
[crowd chants
"we want tables"]

41:54.633 --> 41:56.600
The last time
I saw something like that,

41:56.666 --> 41:58.066
nothing good came of it,

41:59.900 --> 42:01.133
if you know what I mean.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.333
[Striker]
What does Cuerno
have in mind here?

42:11.133 --> 42:13.166
And if Cuerno can hit this,

42:14.200 --> 42:17.433
-Fenix may never
rise from the ashes again.
-No way.

42:17.500 --> 42:20.733
-No way, dude. No way.
-Under the watchful eye
of Mil Muertes.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.800
-[Vampiro] Forget about it.
-It looks like
the thrill of the hunt

42:23.866 --> 42:25.466
from the second rope.

42:25.533 --> 42:27.733
Fenix senses the danger.

42:28.166 --> 42:31.366
Fenix switches his position,
gets out of harm's way.

42:31.433 --> 42:34.366
[Vampiro]  Oh!
Leaping palm strike.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.400
Oh, my god.  [chuckles]

42:37.333 --> 42:39.366
[Striker]  Fenix knows
his tools so well.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.066
Both these fighters
fatigued.

42:42.133 --> 42:44.333
Oh!

42:49.433 --> 42:50.866
And now Fenix scrambles.

42:50.933 --> 42:52.200
Fenix!

42:52.966 --> 42:55.400
-[Vampiro]  No way. No way.
-He has four rungs
to cover.

42:55.466 --> 42:57.666
Three, two,

42:57.866 --> 43:00.333
Fenix's hand
is on the top rung.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.466
Pulling himself
with everything he has.

43:02.533 --> 43:04.266
Can this young man do it?

43:04.333 --> 43:06.966
Can he reach the pinnacle?

43:07.033 --> 43:08.500
- [bell dings]
-Fenix is the Gift of the Gods
champion!

43:08.566 --> 43:09.900
[Santos]  Here's you winner

43:09.966 --> 43:13.066
And new Gift of the Gods
champion,

43:13.133 --> 43:15.200
Fenix!

43:15.733 --> 43:18.100
[Striker]  After everything
Fenix has been through,

43:18.166 --> 43:21.866
after every single fight
from last year to this year,

43:21.933 --> 43:25.733
this young man
is now the number-1 contender

43:25.800 --> 43:29.433
to Mil Muertes'
Lucha Underground Championship.

43:30.033 --> 43:33.066
When that match
will happen remains to be seen,

43:33.133 --> 43:36.666
but when it does,
it's gonna be a damn good one.

43:39.466 --> 43:43.633
Ladies and gentlemen,
for Vampiro, I am Matt Striker.

43:43.900 --> 43:46.033
This has has been
an incredible night.

43:46.100 --> 43:49.066
We are well on our way
to Aztec Warfare.

43:49.133 --> 43:51.400
We'll see you
right back here next week.

43:51.466 --> 43:53.800
Who knows
what's gonna happen?

43:54.033 --> 43:57.166
Join us and find out
on "Lucha Underground."
