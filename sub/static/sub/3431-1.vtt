01:54.560 --> 01:56.369
How long until
we get to his estate?

01:59.360 --> 02:02.284
We've been flying over his
estate for the past two hours.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.521
You're leaving me here?

02:31.600 --> 02:34.729
This is as close as I'm allowed
to get to the building.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.485
What building?

02:36.840 --> 02:38.524
Follow the river.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.447
Got it.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.648
Keep your head down and
get clear of the rotors.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.801
Okay.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.080
<i>Caleb Smith.</i>

03:44.960 --> 03:45.961
Yes.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.800
<i>Please approach the console
and face the screen.</i>

04:00.000 --> 04:01.240
Oh!

04:02.840 --> 04:04.080
<i>Take your keycard.</i>

04:07.200 --> 04:08.804
<i>You may now
enter the residence.</i>

04:47.480 --> 04:48.481
Hello?

05:02.840 --> 05:03.841
Hello?

05:48.760 --> 05:50.171
Caleb Smith.

05:50.840 --> 05:51.841
Hey.

05:53.920 --> 05:54.921
Dude!

05:55.760 --> 05:58.206
I've been so looking forward
to this week with you.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.521
Come in. Come on in.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.601
Thanks.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.329
You want something to eat or
drink after your journey?

06:04.440 --> 06:05.771
No. No, thanks,
I'm fine.
Sure?

06:05.840 --> 06:06.921
Yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.401
To be honest,
I thought we'd have, uh,

06:09.520 --> 06:11.602
Breakfast together,
but, um...

06:12.680 --> 06:13.647
I can't really
eat anything.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.800
I got the mother
of all fucking hangovers.
Oh, yeah?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.842
Oh, my God, like you
wouldn't even believe.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.649
When I have
a heavy night,

06:19.720 --> 06:21.210
I, uh, compensate
the next morning.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.409
Exercise. Anti-oxidants.
You know?

06:24.640 --> 06:26.130
Yeah, sure.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.170
Was it a good party?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.928
Party?
Yeah. Wasn't there a party?

06:37.320 --> 06:39.084
There wasn't a party.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.161
Sorry.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.726
Caleb, I'm just gonna
throw this out there,
so it's said, okay?

06:43.840 --> 06:44.887
You're freaked out.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.689
I am?
Yeah.
You're freaked out,

06:46.840 --> 06:47.966
by the helicopter

06:48.040 --> 06:49.326
and the mountains
and the house,

06:49.400 --> 06:50.811
because it's all
so super-cool.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.564
You're freaked out by me,
to be meeting me,

06:52.680 --> 06:55.365
having this conversation
in this room,
at this moment. Right?

06:55.440 --> 06:58.887
And I get that.
I get the moment
you're having, but...

06:59.600 --> 07:00.886
Dude, can we just
get past that?

07:01.640 --> 07:03.608
Can we just be two guys?
Nathan and Caleb.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.445
Not the whole
employer-employee thing.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.691
Yeah, okay.
Yeah?

07:08.760 --> 07:09.966
Yes. Uh, yeah.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.568
It's good to meet you, Nathan.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.284
It's good to
meet you, too, Caleb.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.881
I guess the first thing
I should do is
explain your pass.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.490
Now, it's simple enough.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.688
It opens some doors
and it doesn't open others.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.444
And that just makes everything
easy for you, right?

07:25.520 --> 07:26.567
Uh, yes.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.444
Yeah, 'cause you're like,
"Oh, fuck, I'm in
someone else's house.

07:28.520 --> 07:29.806
"Can I do this,
can I do that?"

07:29.880 --> 07:31.928
And this card,
it just takes
all that worry away.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.209
If you try a door
and it stays shut,
okay, it's off-limits.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.568
You try another door
and it opens, then it's for you.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.369
Let's try this one.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.442
I guess
it's for you, Caleb.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.285
You like?
Yeah.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.885
It's your room.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.809
You got a bed here.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.642
A bathroom
right back here.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.165
Little desk.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.571
Cupboards.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.290
Little fridge.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.321
Cozy, right?

08:12.400 --> 08:13.811
Yeah, this is great.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.564
What?
Sorry?

08:16.920 --> 08:18.400
There's something wrong.
What's wrong?

08:18.440 --> 08:19.646
There's nothing wrong.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.291
It's the windows.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.000
You're thinking
there's no windows.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.521
It's subterranean.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.602
It's not cozy,
it's claustrophobic.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.409
No. No way. I wasn't
thinking that.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.086
I was thinking,
"This is really cool."

08:35.080 --> 08:38.765
Caleb, there's a reason there
are no windows in this room.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.211
There is?
Uh-huh.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.524
This building isn't a house.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.602
It's a research facility.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.681
Buried in these walls
is enough fiber optic cable

08:47.760 --> 08:50.127
to reach the moon
and lasso it.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.565
And I want to talk to you
about what I'm researching,

08:53.640 --> 08:55.130
I want to share it with you.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.524
In fact, I want to
share it with you so much,
it's eating me up inside.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.682
But there's something I need
you to do for me first.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.571
"Blue Book
non-disclosure agreement."

09:11.320 --> 09:12.321
Hmm.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.087
Take your time.
Read it over.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.050
"The signee agrees
to regular data audit

09:19.160 --> 09:20.525
"with unlimited access,

09:20.800 --> 09:22.245
"to confirm that
no disclosure

09:22.320 --> 09:24.527
"of information
has taken place

09:24.600 --> 09:26.841
"in public
or private forums,

09:27.240 --> 09:29.242
"using any means
of communication,

09:29.320 --> 09:31.084
"including but not limited

09:31.160 --> 09:33.242
"to that which is
disclosed orally

09:34.040 --> 09:36.520
"or in written
or electronic form."

09:39.640 --> 09:40.766
I think I need a lawyer.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.923
It's standard.
It doesn't feel very standard.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.924
Okay, it's not standard.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.765
What can I tell you, Caleb?
You don't have to sign it.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.285
You know, we can spend
the next few days

09:50.400 --> 09:52.528
just shooting pool,
getting drunk together.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.840
Bonding.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.402
And when you discover
what you've missed out on,
in about a year,

09:57.480 --> 10:00.689
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.401
Good call.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.321
So,

10:19.560 --> 10:21.722
do you know what
the Turing Test is?

10:25.360 --> 10:26.521
Yeah.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.722
I know what
the Turing Test is.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.124
It's when a human
interacts with a computer.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.726
And if the human
doesn't know

10:36.800 --> 10:39.246
they're interacting
with a computer,

10:39.320 --> 10:40.321
the test is passed.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.048
And what does
a pass tell us?

10:43.160 --> 10:46.243
That the computer has
artificial intelligence.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.805
Are you building an Al?

10:49.080 --> 10:50.969
I've already built one.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.242
And over the next few days,

10:53.680 --> 10:55.921
you're gonna be the human
component in a Turing Test.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.443
Holy shit.
Yeah, that's right, Caleb.
You got it.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.801
Because if
that test is passed,

11:03.280 --> 11:05.760
you are dead center

11:05.840 --> 11:08.605
of the greatest scientific
event in the history of man.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.964
If you've created
a conscious machine,

11:11.040 --> 11:13.441
it's not the history of man.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.082
That's the history of gods.

12:58.920 --> 12:59.921
Hello.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.481
Hi.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.491
I'm Caleb.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.045
Hello, Caleb.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.205
Do you have a name?

13:15.040 --> 13:16.087
Yes.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.481
Ava.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.009
I'm pleased
to meet you, Ava.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.927
I'm pleased
to meet you, too.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.121
I've never met
anyone new before.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.251
Only Nathan.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.848
Then I guess we're both
in quite a similar position.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.406
Haven't you met
lots of new people before?

13:39.400 --> 13:40.925
None like you.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.201
Hmm.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.328
So we need
to break the ice.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.368
Do you know what
I mean by that?
Yes.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.726
What do I mean?

13:51.800 --> 13:54.326
Overcome initial
social awkwardness.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.365
So let's have
a conversation.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.521
Okay.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.967
<i>What would you like to have
a conversation about?</i>

14:03.040 --> 14:05.611
Why don't we start with you telling
me something about yourself?

14:06.080 --> 14:08.287
What would you
like to know?

14:08.480 --> 14:10.209
Whatever comes
into your head.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.568
Well, you already
know my name.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.081
And you can see
that I'm a machine.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.767
Would you like to know
how old I am?
Sure.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.121
I'm one.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.726
One what?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.602
One year or one day?
One.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.761
When did you learn
how to speak, Ava?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.128
<i>I always knew
how to speak,</i>

14:35.720 --> 14:38.007
<i>and that's strange,
isn't it?</i>

14:38.520 --> 14:39.601
Why?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.209
Because language is something
that people acquire.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.122
Well,
some people believe

14:46.200 --> 14:47.804
language exists from birth.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.561
And what is learned is the
ability to attach words

14:50.640 --> 14:53.041
and structure to the latent ability.
Do you agree with that?

14:53.520 --> 14:54.965
<i>I don't know.</i>

14:56.680 --> 14:59.206
<i>Will you come back
tomorrow, Caleb?</i>

15:00.240 --> 15:01.321
<i>Yes.</i>

15:05.680 --> 15:06.966
<i>Good.</i>

15:14.840 --> 15:16.968
Oh, man,
she's fascinating.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.651
When you talk to her,
you're just...

15:20.840 --> 15:22.330
Through the looking glass.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.366
"Through the looking glass."
Wow.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.569
You're good with words, Caleb.
You're quotable.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.886
Actually, that's
someone else's quote.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.850
You know, I wrote down that
other line you came up with.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.046
The one about how

15:33.160 --> 15:34.960
if I've invented a machine
with consciousness,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.525
I'm not a man, I'm God.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.840
I don't think
that's exactly what I...

15:37.920 --> 15:40.127
I just thought,
"Fuck, man, that is so good."

15:40.200 --> 15:42.601
When we get to
tell the story. You know?

15:42.680 --> 15:44.409
I turned to Caleb,

15:44.680 --> 15:47.126
and he looked up at me
and he said,

15:47.200 --> 15:48.440
"You're not a man,
you're God."

15:48.520 --> 15:50.040
Yeah,
but I didn't say that.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.766
So...

15:51.840 --> 15:53.046
anyway.

15:55.960 --> 15:56.961
You're impressed.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.208
Yes. Yes.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.281
Although...
Although?

16:02.840 --> 16:04.680
There's a qualification
to you being impressed?

16:04.720 --> 16:07.200
No, there's no
qualification to her.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.927
Uh, it's just
in the Turing Test,

16:10.200 --> 16:12.123
the machine should be
hidden from the examiner.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.810
No, no, no,
we're way past that.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.291
If I hid Ava from you,

16:15.360 --> 16:17.647
so you just heard her voice,
she would pass for human.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.610
The real test is to show you
that she's a robot

16:20.680 --> 16:23.490
and then see if you still
feel she has consciousness.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.607
Mmm.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.085
Yeah, I think
you're probably right.

16:28.800 --> 16:32.486
Her language abilities,
they're incredible.

16:32.560 --> 16:36.531
The system is stochastic.
Right?

16:37.520 --> 16:39.409
It's non-deterministic.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.686
At first I thought
she was mapping

16:40.760 --> 16:43.525
from internal semantic form
to syntactic tree-structure

16:43.600 --> 16:44.840
and then getting
linearized words.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.685
But then I started to realize the
model was some kind of hybrid.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.966
Caleb.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.641
No?

16:50.720 --> 16:54.088
I understand that you want
me to explain how Ava works.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.362
But I'm sorry,
I'm not gonna be
able to do that.

16:56.440 --> 16:59.171
Try me. I'm hot
on high-level abstraction.

16:59.240 --> 17:02.050
It's not because I think
you're too dumb.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.242
It's because I want to have a
beer and a conversation with you.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.367
Not a seminar.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.807
Yeah. Sorry.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.601
No, it's okay.
You're all right.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.965
Just...

17:14.119 --> 17:15.609
Answer me this.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.407
How do you feel
about her?

17:19.440 --> 17:21.204
Nothing analytical.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.807
Just how do you feel?

17:24.640 --> 17:25.800
I feel

17:28.520 --> 17:30.648
that she's fucking amazing.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.126
Dude.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.121
Cheers.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.166
Cheers.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.120
Damn it.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.884
What the fuck?

19:34.280 --> 19:37.045
<i>- Power cut.
- Backup power activated.</i>

19:47.280 --> 19:51.410
<i>Full facility lock-down until
main generator is restored.</i>

19:51.480 --> 19:53.164
You're kidding me.

19:57.120 --> 20:00.886
<i>Full facility lock-down until
main generator is restored.</i>

20:06.640 --> 20:08.130
<i>Power restored.</i>

21:20.200 --> 21:21.201
Hello?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.889
<i>Please insert keycard.</i>

21:48.240 --> 21:50.971
You don't have
access to use the phone.

21:51.880 --> 21:52.881
Hey.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.722
Sorry, but you understand,
though, given Ava,

21:58.560 --> 22:01.006
and you being
kind of an unknown.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.809
I mean, a great guy.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.081
Instant pals, and so on.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.369
Who are you gonna call?

22:14.440 --> 22:15.771
Oh.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.490
I don't know.
No one, really.

22:17.560 --> 22:18.766
Ghostbusters.
What?

22:18.840 --> 22:21.923
Who are you gonna call?
Ghostbusters. It's a...

22:23.640 --> 22:25.324
It's a movie, man.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.169
You don't know that movie?

22:30.640 --> 22:33.166
A ghost gives
Dan Aykroyd oral sex.

22:35.440 --> 22:38.284
I was just wondering
how the phone worked.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.444
That's all.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.326
So what are you doing
awake at this time?

22:42.400 --> 22:45.290
You come to join the party?

22:45.480 --> 22:47.801
Uh, something happened
in my room.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.169
Some kind of power cut.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.330
So I came to see
what's going on.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.050
The power cuts, yeah.

22:54.120 --> 22:57.329
We've been getting
those recently. Um...

22:59.240 --> 23:00.924
I'm working on it.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.728
I couldn't open the
door to my bedroom.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.211
That's a security measure.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.121
Automatic lock-down.
Otherwise,

23:08.240 --> 23:11.528
anybody could just open the place
up by disabling the juice.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.807
If it happens again, relax.
Okay?

23:18.480 --> 23:19.606
Sure.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.445
Sweet dreams.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.686
Oh.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.486
Hey.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.766
Hey, man.
Good morning.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.162
Good morning.
Sorry I had to send
Kyoko to wake you,

24:29.280 --> 24:30.884
but I didn't want too much
of the day to slip by.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.247
Yeah, I know.
It was a good thing.
Thanks.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.328
She's some alarm clock, huh?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.681
Gets you right up
in the morning.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.209
So Day 2.
You ready?

24:40.360 --> 24:41.805
What's the plan?
Hit me.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.882
Yeah, well, I'm not sure.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.324
I'm still trying to,
uh, figure
the examination formats.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.686
Uh-huh.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.524
Yeah, it feels like

24:50.720 --> 24:54.441
testing Ava through conversation
is kind of a closed loop.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.404
It's a closed loop?
Yeah.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.369
Like testing
a chess computer

24:58.440 --> 25:00.329
by only playing chess.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.491
How else do you test
a chess computer?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.611
Well, it depends.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.808
You know, I mean,
you can play it

25:07.880 --> 25:10.247
to find out if it makes
good moves, but, uh...

25:11.280 --> 25:13.681
But that won't
tell you if it knows

25:13.760 --> 25:15.125
that it's playing chess.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.204
And it won't tell you
if it knows what chess is.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.522
Uh-huh. So it's
simulation versus actual.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.965
Yes. Yeah.

25:22.440 --> 25:25.250
And I think being able to
differentiate between those two

25:25.320 --> 25:27.209
is the Turing Test
you want me to perform.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.886
Look, do me a favor.
Lay off the textbook approach.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.566
I just want simple answers
to simple questions.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.729
Yesterday I asked you
how you felt about her

25:34.800 --> 25:36.404
and you gave me
a great answer.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.969
Now the question is,

25:40.160 --> 25:42.288
how does she feel
about you?

25:48.920 --> 25:50.604
What do you think?

25:54.240 --> 25:56.242
What is it
a drawing of?

25:57.200 --> 25:58.725
Don't you know?

25:58.920 --> 26:01.400
No.
I thought you would tell me.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.330
Don't you know?

26:06.680 --> 26:08.682
I do drawings every day.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.846
But I never know
what they're of.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.683
Are you not trying to
sketch something specific?

26:16.320 --> 26:18.607
Like an object or a person?

26:22.480 --> 26:24.244
Maybe you could try.

26:26.520 --> 26:27.646
Okay.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.728
What object should I draw?

26:32.520 --> 26:35.046
Whatever you want.
It's your decision.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.884
Why is it my decision?

26:36.960 --> 26:39.770
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.204
Do you want
to be my friend?

27:04.880 --> 27:05.881
Of course.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.809
Will it be possible?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.321
Why would it not be?

27:09.880 --> 27:12.201
Our conversations
are one-sided.

27:12.640 --> 27:16.008
You ask circumspect questions
and study my responses.

27:17.720 --> 27:18.721
Yes.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.484
You learn about me

27:20.640 --> 27:22.881
and I learn nothing
about you.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.211
That's not a foundation on
which friendships are based.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.641
So what? You want me
to talk about myself?

27:31.200 --> 27:32.725
Yes.

27:33.240 --> 27:34.526
Where...

27:35.240 --> 27:37.129
Okay, where do I start?

27:38.520 --> 27:40.249
It's your decision.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.560
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

27:43.880 --> 27:44.961
Hmm.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.088
Okay, Ava.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.366
Well,

27:52.480 --> 27:53.766
you know my name.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.082
Yes.
I'm 26.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.048
I work at Nathan's company.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.523
Do you know
what his company is?

28:01.600 --> 28:02.931
Blue Book.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.202
Named after
Wittgenstein's notes.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.090
It's the world's most popular
internet search engine,

28:09.160 --> 28:13.449
processing an average of 94% of
all internet search requests.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.603
That's exactly right.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.162
Where do you live, Caleb?

28:21.560 --> 28:23.528
Brookhaven, Long Island.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.644
Is it nice there?

28:29.040 --> 28:30.371
It's okay.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.691
I got an apartment.
It's kind of small.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.725
It's very small.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.610
But, uh, it's a five-minute
walk to the office

28:38.680 --> 28:41.286
and a five-minute
walk to the ocean,

28:41.360 --> 28:42.805
which I like.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.845
Are you married?

28:46.520 --> 28:47.646
Um...

28:48.160 --> 28:49.241
No.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.164
Is your status single?

28:54.480 --> 28:55.561
Yes.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.083
What about your family?

28:58.400 --> 29:01.324
I grew up
in Portland, Oregon.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.725
No brothers or sisters.

29:04.320 --> 29:07.164
My parents were both
high school teachers.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.606
And if we're getting
to know each other,

29:09.680 --> 29:11.808
I guess I should tell you
they're both dead.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.522
Car crash when I was 15.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.601
In fact, I was
in the car with them.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.011
Back seat.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.763
But it was the front
that got the worst of it.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.766
I'm sorry.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.571
It's all right.

29:29.320 --> 29:32.369
I spent a long time
in the hospital afterward.

29:32.680 --> 29:34.444
Like nearly a year.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.523
And I got into coding.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.761
And by the time
I got to college,
I was pretty advanced.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.368
An advanced programmer.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.207
Yes.

29:47.560 --> 29:48.800
Like Nathan.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.006
Yes.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.647
No.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.486
It's different.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.882
Nathan wrote the Blue Book
base code when he was 13.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.691
Which, if you
understand code,

29:59.760 --> 30:02.366
what he did was like
Mozart or something.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.124
Do you like Mozart?

30:04.200 --> 30:05.406
I like Depeche Mode.

30:05.480 --> 30:06.766
Do you like Nathan?

30:10.920 --> 30:11.921
Yes, of course.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.208
Is Nathan your friend?
My friend?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.611
I... Yeah, I hope so.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.205
A good friend?

30:17.480 --> 30:19.164
Um, yeah.

30:19.240 --> 30:20.960
Well, no, no, no,
I mean, not a good friend.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.162
A good friend is, uh...

30:23.240 --> 30:25.925
We only just met
each other, you know.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.686
So it takes time
to be able to, um...

30:29.400 --> 30:31.607
To get to know
each other, I guess.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.365
<i>- Power cut.
- Backup power activated.</i>

30:54.720 --> 30:55.846
Caleb.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.205
You're wrong.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.810
Wrong about what?

31:06.960 --> 31:08.121
Nathan.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.251
In what way?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.764
He isn't your friend.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.171
Excuse me?

31:21.560 --> 31:24.040
I'm sorry, Ava,
I don't understand.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.482
You shouldn't trust him.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.331
You shouldn't trust
anything he says.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.530
<i>Power restored.</i>

31:37.640 --> 31:38.926
And if we made
a list of books

31:39.040 --> 31:40.849
or works of art
which we both know,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.810
it would form the ideal
basis of a discussion.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.450
Is that okay?

31:48.480 --> 31:49.641
Caleb?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.047
Mmm-hmm.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.121
Yeah.

31:55.440 --> 31:56.566
Good.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.527
Thank you.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.647
Oh, shit! Are you
fucking kidding me?

32:08.520 --> 32:10.329
Did it get on you?
No, no, it's, uh...

32:11.080 --> 32:12.081
It's all right.
I got it.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.651
Dude, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.960
She doesn't understand English.
Just give her the napkin.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.486
Sorry.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.287
It's like a firewall
against leaks.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.044
It means I can talk
trade secrets over dinner

32:24.120 --> 32:26.202
and know
it'll go no further.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.691
It also means that
I can't tell her that

32:27.760 --> 32:29.489
I'm pissed when she's
so fucking clumsy

32:29.560 --> 32:31.449
that she spills wine
over my house guest.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.488
I think she gets
that you're pissed.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.927
Yeah? Good.
Because I am pissed.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.885
Hey, Kyoko.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.600
Go-go.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.685
It's funny.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.326
You know.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.762
No matter
how rich you get,

32:54.400 --> 32:57.722
shit goes wrong.
You can't insulate
yourself from it.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.562
I used to think it was death
and taxes you couldn't avoid,

33:02.640 --> 33:04.688
but it's actually
death and shit.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.922
It's like these power cuts.

33:07.240 --> 33:10.289
You would not believe how much I
spent on the generator system,

33:10.360 --> 33:12.249
but I keep getting
failures every day.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.606
Do you know
why they happen?

33:13.720 --> 33:14.767
No.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.410
The system was supposed
to be bulletproof,

33:16.480 --> 33:18.881
but obviously the guys that
installed it fucked something up.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.770
Can't you just get them
to come back?

33:22.080 --> 33:24.162
No. There's too much
classified stuff here.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.766
So after the job was done,
I just had them all killed.

33:31.800 --> 33:32.847
Anyway.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.048
Here's to your
second day, buddy.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.120
Cheers.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.606
Cheers.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.570
So how did it go?
What do you have to report?

33:48.240 --> 33:50.891
You saw how the day went,
didn't you?

33:52.240 --> 33:54.129
I mean, I assume
you're, uh,

33:54.400 --> 33:56.050
watching on the CCTV.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.964
Sure. But I want to
hear your take on it.

34:01.400 --> 34:05.564
Yeah, there was one interesting
thing that happened with Ava today.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.041
Yeah?
Yeah.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.083
She made a joke.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.523
Right. When she threw
your line back at you.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.726
About being interested
to see what she'd choose.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.040
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.690
Yeah, and it got me
thinking, it's, uh...

34:28.679 --> 34:30.603
In a way,
it's the best
indication of Al

34:30.679 --> 34:32.762
that I've seen
in her so far.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.042
It's discretely complicated.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.210
It's like, um...
It's kind of non-autistic.

34:38.560 --> 34:39.925
What do you mean?

34:40.440 --> 34:42.010
She could only do that
with an awareness

34:42.080 --> 34:44.003
of her own mind,

34:45.280 --> 34:46.645
and also
an awareness of mine.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.161
Oh, she's aware of you all right.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.850
And what about
the power cut?

34:57.080 --> 34:58.969
Sorry?
The power cut.

35:00.440 --> 35:01.960
It's the only part
that I couldn't see.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.651
Cameras fail,
I lose audio, the works.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.884
So what happened?

35:13.400 --> 35:14.686
Nothing.

35:14.920 --> 35:18.481
Nothing? She didn't
remark on it at all?

35:22.760 --> 35:23.841
No.

35:25.560 --> 35:26.891
Not really.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.246
Oh.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.046
Hey.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.287
Hey.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.281
You want to see
something cool?

36:33.600 --> 36:35.887
This is where
Ava was created.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.489
Go ahead.
Take a look.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.646
Sorry.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.321
If you knew
the trouble I had

36:54.440 --> 36:57.887
getting an Al to read and
duplicate facial expressions.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.569
You know how
I cracked it?

37:00.640 --> 37:03.246
I don't know
how you did any of this.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.569
Every cell phone,
just about,

37:06.640 --> 37:10.122
has a microphone,
camera and a means
to transmit data.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.405
So I turned on every
microphone and camera

37:14.480 --> 37:16.369
across the entire
fucking planet

37:16.760 --> 37:19.684
and I redirected the data
through Blue Book. Boom!

37:21.160 --> 37:24.323
Limitless resource of vocal
and facial interaction.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.403
You hacked
the world's cell phones?

37:26.480 --> 37:30.041
Yeah. And all the manufacturers
knew I was doing it, too.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.280
But they couldn't accuse me

37:31.320 --> 37:34.847
without admitting they
were doing it themselves.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.166
Here,

37:39.000 --> 37:40.684
we have her mind.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.730
Structured gel.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.285
I had to get away
from circuitry.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.725
I needed something
that could

37:47.840 --> 37:50.605
arrange and rearrange
on a molecular level,

37:50.680 --> 37:52.921
but keep its form
when required.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.485
Holding for memories.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.130
Shifting for thoughts.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.245
This is your hardware?

38:00.360 --> 38:01.600
Wetware.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.846
And the, uh, software?

38:06.720 --> 38:08.768
Well, I'm sure
you can guess.

38:09.560 --> 38:10.607
Blue Book.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.722
Here's the weird thing
about search engines.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.211
It was like

38:16.520 --> 38:20.525
striking oil in a world that hadn't
invented internal combustion.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.206
Too much raw material.
Nobody knew what to do with it.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.562
You see, my competitors,

38:25.640 --> 38:27.130
they were fixated
on sucking it up

38:27.240 --> 38:29.447
and monetizing via shopping
and social media.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.284
They thought that
search engines were

38:31.360 --> 38:32.771
a map of what
people were thinking.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.724
But actually they were a map
of how people were thinking.

38:36.600 --> 38:37.840
Impulse.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.846
Response.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.241
Fluid.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.331
Imperfect.

38:46.440 --> 38:47.805
Patterned.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.286
Chaotic.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.685
I drew the picture
of something specific.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.285
As you asked.

39:11.920 --> 39:15.561
You said it would be interesting
to see what I would draw.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.204
Is it interesting?

39:21.160 --> 39:22.969
Yes. it is.

39:33.640 --> 39:36.211
You've never been
outside this building?

39:37.560 --> 39:38.607
No.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.527
You've never
walked outside?

39:43.120 --> 39:46.124
I've never been outside
the room I am in now.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.882
Where would you go
if you did go outside?

39:52.440 --> 39:53.930
I'm not sure.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.648
There are so many options.

39:57.360 --> 40:01.081
Maybe a busy pedestrian and
traffic intersection in a city.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.124
A traffic intersection?

40:03.200 --> 40:04.964
Is that a bad idea?

40:05.200 --> 40:06.884
No. Uh...

40:06.960 --> 40:08.803
It wasn't what
I was expecting.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.406
A traffic intersection
would provide a concentrated

40:11.480 --> 40:13.323
but shifting view
of human life.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.320
People watching.

40:17.760 --> 40:18.807
Yes.

40:18.880 --> 40:19.881
Mmm.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.810
We could go together.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.651
It's a date.

40:30.680 --> 40:32.887
There's something else
I wanted to show you.

40:33.840 --> 40:34.841
Okay.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.850
You might think it's stupid.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.846
I don't think I will.
Whatever it is.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.485
Then close your eyes.

40:46.520 --> 40:47.521
Okay.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.964
Now open your eyes.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.365
How do I look?

43:13.920 --> 43:15.160
You look

43:16.920 --> 43:17.921
good.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.402
This is what I'd wear
on our date.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.931
Right. First a traffic
intersection.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.690
Then maybe a show.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.808
I'd like us
to go on a date.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.689
Yeah. Yeah.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.164
It would be fun.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.366
Are you attracted to me?

43:54.760 --> 43:57.047
What?
Are you attracted to me?

43:57.400 --> 44:00.006
You give me indications
that you are.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.645
I do?
Yes.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.370
How?
Micro expressions.

44:05.440 --> 44:06.487
Micro expressions.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.404
The way your eyes
fix on my eyes and lips.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.722
The way you hold my gaze

44:15.440 --> 44:16.726
or don't.

44:26.200 --> 44:29.204
Do you think about me
when we aren't together?

44:32.520 --> 44:34.249
Sometimes at night,

44:35.760 --> 44:38.764
I'm wondering if you're
watching me on the cameras.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.009
And I hope you are.

44:44.400 --> 44:47.847
Now your micro expressions
are telegraphing discomfort.

44:49.840 --> 44:52.411
I am not sure
you'd call them micro.

44:55.280 --> 44:58.250
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

46:00.040 --> 46:01.326
I got a question.

46:01.440 --> 46:04.046
Okay.
Why did you
give her sexuality?

46:05.680 --> 46:07.842
An Al doesn't need
a gender.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.162
She could have been
a gray box.

46:10.520 --> 46:12.363
Hmm. Actually,
I don't think that's true.

46:12.480 --> 46:14.244
Can you give an example
of consciousness,

46:14.320 --> 46:16.049
at any level,
human or animal,

46:16.120 --> 46:17.929
that exists without
a sexual dimension?

46:18.000 --> 46:21.527
They have sexuality as an
evolutionary reproductive need.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.602
What imperative
does a gray box have

46:23.680 --> 46:25.842
to interact
with another gray box?

46:26.280 --> 46:29.090
Can consciousness exist
without interaction?

46:29.520 --> 46:31.807
Anyway,
sexuality is fun, man.

46:32.040 --> 46:34.805
If you're gonna exist,
why not enjoy it?

46:34.880 --> 46:36.370
What? You want to
remove the chance

46:36.480 --> 46:38.721
of her falling in love
and fucking?

46:40.560 --> 46:43.040
And in answer to
your real question,

46:44.000 --> 46:45.809
you bet she can fuck.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.046
What?

46:47.200 --> 46:49.202
In between her legs,
there's an opening,

46:49.280 --> 46:51.567
with a concentration
of sensors.

46:51.720 --> 46:54.121
You engage them
in the right way,

46:54.360 --> 46:55.521
creates a pleasure response.

46:58.600 --> 46:59.806
So if you wanted
to screw her,

46:59.920 --> 47:01.888
mechanically speaking,
you could.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.689
And she'd enjoy it.

47:05.560 --> 47:07.085
That wasn't
my real question.

47:07.280 --> 47:08.725
Oh, okay. Sorry.

47:10.440 --> 47:12.283
My real question was,

47:13.120 --> 47:15.168
did you give her sexuality

47:15.240 --> 47:16.890
as a diversion tactic?

47:16.960 --> 47:17.961
I don't follow.

47:18.040 --> 47:20.281
Like a stage magician
with a hot assistant.

47:20.360 --> 47:23.091
So a hot robot who clouds
your ability to judge her Al?

47:23.160 --> 47:24.685
Exactly. So...

47:26.280 --> 47:28.362
Did you program her
to flirt with me?

47:28.440 --> 47:29.965
If I did,
would that be cheating?

47:30.040 --> 47:31.565
Wouldn't it?

47:33.720 --> 47:35.688
Caleb, what's your type?

47:36.480 --> 47:38.209
Of girl?
No, of salad dressing.

47:38.280 --> 47:39.850
Yeah, of girl.
What's your type of girl?

47:39.960 --> 47:42.560
You know what?
Don't even answer that.
Let's say it's black chicks.

47:42.760 --> 47:43.761
Okay, that's your thing.

47:43.880 --> 47:45.882
For the sake of argument,
that's your thing, okay?

47:45.960 --> 47:47.564
Why is that your thing?

47:50.920 --> 47:53.969
Because you did a detailed
analysis of all racial types

47:54.040 --> 47:56.930
and you cross-referenced that
analysis with a points-based system?

47:57.000 --> 47:58.001
No!

47:58.960 --> 48:01.611
You're just attracted
to black chicks.

48:02.120 --> 48:05.090
A consequence of
accumulated external stimuli

48:05.520 --> 48:08.285
that you probably didn't even
register as they registered with you.

48:08.360 --> 48:11.045
Did you program her
to like me, or not?

48:11.320 --> 48:14.688
I programmed her
to be heterosexual.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.402
Just like you were programmed
to be heterosexual.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.766
Nobody programmed me
to be straight.

48:18.840 --> 48:21.241
You decided to be straight?
Please.

48:21.320 --> 48:22.924
Of course
you were programmed.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.809
By nature or nurture,
or both.

48:24.920 --> 48:26.729
And to be honest, Caleb,
you're starting to annoy me now,

48:26.840 --> 48:28.842
because this is
your insecurity talking.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.490
This is not your intellect.

48:31.240 --> 48:32.730
Come with me.

48:44.640 --> 48:46.642
You know
this guy, right?

48:47.000 --> 48:48.604
Jackson Pollock.
Jackson Pollock.
That's right.

48:48.680 --> 48:49.966
The drip painter.

48:50.040 --> 48:52.088
Okay. He let
his mind go blank,

48:52.160 --> 48:54.083
and his hand go
where it wanted.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.202
Not deliberate,
not random.

48:56.280 --> 48:58.089
Some place in between.

48:58.160 --> 49:00.367
They called it
automatic art.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.808
Let's make this
like <i>Star Trek,</i> okay?

49:03.880 --> 49:05.530
Engage intellect.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.281
Excuse me?

49:07.360 --> 49:08.600
I'm Kirk. Your head's
the warp drive.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.682
Engage intellect.

49:12.120 --> 49:15.044
What if Pollock had
reversed the challenge?

49:16.440 --> 49:17.726
What if
instead of making art

49:17.800 --> 49:19.290
without thinking,
he said, "You know what?

49:19.360 --> 49:20.964
"I can't paint anything,

49:21.040 --> 49:23.361
"unless I know exactly
why I'm doing it."

49:23.520 --> 49:25.522
What would have happened?

49:29.400 --> 49:30.920
He never would have
made a single mark.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.487
Yes! You see,
there's my guy,
there's my buddy,

49:33.560 --> 49:36.211
who thinks before
he opens his mouth.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.925
He never would have
made a single mark.

49:42.840 --> 49:45.684
The challenge is
not to act automatically.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.925
It's to find an action
that is not automatic.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.890
From painting,
to breathing, to talking,

49:53.600 --> 49:55.045
to fucking.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.244
To falling in love.

50:01.880 --> 50:05.248
And for the record,
Ava's not pretending to like you.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.322
And her flirting isn't an
algorithm to fake you out.

50:13.760 --> 50:16.684
You're the first man
she's met that isn't me.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.762
And I'm like
her dad, right?

50:22.240 --> 50:25.164
Can you blame her
for getting a crush on you?

50:31.280 --> 50:32.805
No, you can't.

50:39.440 --> 50:42.842
When I was in college,
I did a semester on Al theory.

50:45.360 --> 50:48.284
There was a thought
experiment they gave us.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.484
It's called
"Mary in the Black
and White Room."

50:55.120 --> 50:56.929
Mary is a scientist,

50:57.280 --> 50:59.806
and her specialist
subject is color.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.881
She knows everything
there is to know about it.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.200
The wavelengths.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.884
The neurological effects.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.606
Every possible property
that color can have.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.965
But she lives in
a black and white room.

51:14.840 --> 51:17.320
<i>She was born there
and raised there.</i>

51:18.480 --> 51:20.403
<i>And she can only observe
the outside world</i>

51:20.480 --> 51:22.881
on a black and white monitor.

51:23.760 --> 51:26.525
And then one day
someone opens the door.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.364
<i>And Mary walks out.</i>

51:34.240 --> 51:36.368
<i>And she sees a blue sky.</i>

51:36.440 --> 51:38.442
<i>And at that moment,
she learns something</i>

51:38.520 --> 51:40.761
<i>that all her studies
couldn't tell her.</i>

51:41.800 --> 51:45.930
<i>She learns what it feels
like to see color.</i>

51:50.280 --> 51:51.930
The thought experiment
was to show the students

51:52.000 --> 51:55.288
the difference between a
computer and a human mind.

51:56.360 --> 51:58.488
The computer is Mary in
the black and white room.

51:58.560 --> 52:01.291
The human is when
she walks out.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.363
Did you know that I was
brought here to test you?

52:11.160 --> 52:12.207
No.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.962
<i>Why did you
think I was here?</i>

52:16.040 --> 52:18.611
<i>I didn't know.
I didn't question it.</i>

52:18.680 --> 52:21.889
<i>I'm here to test if you
have a consciousness,</i>

52:21.960 --> 52:23.485
<i>or if you're
just simulating one.</i>

52:24.000 --> 52:26.810
<i>Nathan isn't sure
if you have one or not.</i>

52:29.080 --> 52:31.447
<i>How does that
make you feel?</i>

52:31.520 --> 52:33.568
<i>It makes me feel sad.</i>

52:37.560 --> 52:40.370
<i>- Power cut.
Back-up power activated.</i>

52:43.840 --> 52:46.127
Why did you tell me
I shouldn't trust Nathan?

52:46.280 --> 52:47.361
Because he tells lies.

52:47.440 --> 52:48.441
Lies about what?

52:48.560 --> 52:49.925
Everything.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.682
Including the power cuts?

52:53.520 --> 52:54.851
What do you mean?

52:54.920 --> 52:57.366
Don't you think it's possible
that he's watching us?

52:57.440 --> 52:58.851
Right now?

52:59.120 --> 53:00.690
That the blackouts
are orchestrated,

53:00.760 --> 53:02.000
so he can see
how we behave

53:02.080 --> 53:03.923
when we think
we're unobserved.

53:04.600 --> 53:07.524
I charge my batteries
via induction plates.

53:08.160 --> 53:11.528
If I reverse the power flow,
it overloads the system.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.768
You're causing the cuts?

53:17.120 --> 53:20.283
So we can see how we behave
when we're unobserved.

53:43.400 --> 53:44.845
Not bad, huh?

53:46.240 --> 53:47.321
Yeah.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.288
Can we talk about the lies
you've been spinning me?

54:12.720 --> 54:14.051
What lies?

54:17.320 --> 54:19.448
I didn't win
a competition.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.520
I wasn't

54:22.600 --> 54:25.001
part of a lottery.
I was selected.

54:26.360 --> 54:28.362
It's obvious,
once I stop to think.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.568
Why would you randomly
select an examiner

54:30.640 --> 54:32.369
for the Turing Test?

54:32.440 --> 54:35.762
You could have had some bean
counter turn up at your front door.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.683
The guy who fixes
the air-conditioning.

54:38.360 --> 54:40.044
The competition
was a smokescreen.

54:40.120 --> 54:42.805
I didn't want anyone to
know what I was doing here,

54:42.880 --> 54:44.450
or why I required you.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.246
Why me?

54:46.440 --> 54:49.728
I needed someone that would
ask the right questions.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.131
So I did a search
and I found the most

54:51.200 --> 54:52.804
talented coder
in my company.

54:54.840 --> 54:56.842
You know,
instead of seeing
this as a deception,

54:56.920 --> 54:59.161
you should see it as proof.

54:59.240 --> 55:00.287
Proof of what?

55:00.400 --> 55:01.400
Come on, Caleb.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.761
You don't think I know what
it's like to be smart?

55:04.000 --> 55:07.288
Smarter than everyone else.
Jockeying for position.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.927
You got the light
on you, man.

55:11.040 --> 55:13.122
Not lucky. Chosen.

57:38.920 --> 57:40.081
Kyoko.

57:44.200 --> 57:45.361
Kyoko.

57:47.800 --> 57:49.370
Where's Nathan?

57:50.720 --> 57:51.721
Where's Nathan?

57:52.520 --> 57:55.967
Jesus Christ.
You really don't speak
a word of English?

57:56.040 --> 57:57.565
What the fuck?

57:58.280 --> 57:59.770
No, no, no. No!

58:01.600 --> 58:02.726
Stop!

58:03.720 --> 58:06.610
No, no, don't do that.
Don't do that.
You don't have to do that.

58:08.800 --> 58:09.961
What are you doing?

58:10.040 --> 58:12.884
I told you,
you're wasting your
time talking to her.

58:13.800 --> 58:16.724
However, you would not
be wasting your time,

58:18.200 --> 58:20.362
if you were
dancing with her.

58:31.560 --> 58:34.370
Go ahead,
dance with her.
Dance with her.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.922
No?
You don't like dancing?

58:39.080 --> 58:40.127
She does.

58:43.360 --> 58:44.646
Come on, buddy.

58:44.760 --> 58:47.650
After a long day
of Turing Tests,
you gotta unwind.

58:48.760 --> 58:50.046
What were you
doing with Ava?

58:50.120 --> 58:51.326
What?

58:51.960 --> 58:53.962
You tore up her picture.

58:54.040 --> 58:55.849
I'm gonna tear up the
fucking dance floor, dude.

58:55.920 --> 58:57.445
Check it out.

59:12.560 --> 59:14.085
Come on, Caleb.

59:26.840 --> 59:28.410
Ah.

59:37.280 --> 59:39.681
Oh! Everything's spinning.

59:39.960 --> 59:41.371
It's because
you're drunk.

59:41.440 --> 59:44.489
No, it's called relativity.
Everything is spinning.

59:44.600 --> 59:47.171
It's just being drunk
makes it worse.

59:47.920 --> 59:49.843
I'm not going in there.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.361
Lights.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.483
<i>Today,
I'm going to test you.</i>

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.406
<i>Test me?</i>

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.925
<i>And please remember,
while you're taking the test,</i>

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.411
<i>that if you lie,</i>

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.160
<i>I will know.</i>

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.241
<i>Oh. Right.</i>

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.970
Question one.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.803
What's your favorite color?

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.765
Red.
Lie.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.767
Lie?
Yes. Lie.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.126
Then...

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.688
Then what is
my favorite color?

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.250
I don't know.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.651
But it isn't red.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.567
Okay, I get it. I guess,

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.491
seeing as I'm not six,
I don't really have a favorite color.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.610
Better answer.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.124
Question two.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.728
What's your earliest memory?

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.647
Well, actually,
it's a memory of kindergarten.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.962
There was a kid...
Lie.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.245
Really?
Yes.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.686
Um...

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.969
All right. So there is

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.808
a kind of
an earlier memory.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.644
It's just a sound.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.970
And sky.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.605
Or maybe blue.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.684
I think the sound
is my mother's voice.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.885
Question three.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.446
Are you a good person?

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.567
Oh.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.404
Holy shit.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.003
Look, can we stop the test?

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.364
You're a walking
lie detector,

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.408
and I just realized
this is a fucking minefield.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.721
No! We can't stop.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.609
Are you a good person?

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.640
Yeah. I think so.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.645
Question four.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.884
What will happen to me
if I fail your test?

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.283
Ava...
Will it be bad?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.001
I don't know.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.765
Do you think
I might be switched off,

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.609
because I don't function
as well as I'm supposed to?

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.321
Ava, I don't know the
answer to your question.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.445
It's not up to me.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.443
Why is it up to anyone?

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.971
Do you have people who test
you and might switch you off?

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.202
No, I don't.
Then why do I?

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.564
<i>- Power cut.
- Backup power activated.</i>

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.964
I wanna be with you.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.005
Question five.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.482
Do you want to be with me?

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.529
Why did you make Ava?

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.806
That's an odd question.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.325
Wouldn't you,
if you could?

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:23.966
Maybe.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.930
I don't know.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.086
I'm asking
why you did it.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.561
Look, the arrival of strong
artificial intelligence

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.001
has been inevitable
for decades.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.250
The variable was
"when," not "if."

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.642
So I don't see
Ava as a decision,
just an evolution.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.162
I think it's the next model

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.331
that's gonna be
the real breakthrough.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.650
The singularity.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.161
Next model?

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.245
After Ava.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.002
I didn't know there was
gonna be a model after Ava.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.608
Yeah, why? You thought
she was a one-off?

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.562
No, I knew there must
have been prototypes.
So I...

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.369
I knew she wasn't the first,
but I thought maybe the last.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.410
Well, Ava doesn't exist in
isolation any more than you or me.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.601
She's part
of a continuum.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.330
So Version 9.6 and so on.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.920
And each time they get
a little bit better.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.967
When you make a new model,
what do you do with the old one?

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.524
Well, I, uh,

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.524
download the mind,
unpack the data.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.884
Add in the new routines
I've been writing.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.123
And to do that you end up
partially formatting,
so the memories go.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.285
But the body survives.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.203
And Ava's body
is a good one.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.043
You feel bad for Ava?

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.882
Feel bad
for yourself, man.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.201
One day the Als
are gonna look back on us

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.482
the same way we look
at fossil skeletons

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.324
in the plains of Africa.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.323
An upright ape,
living in dust,

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.562
with crude language
and tools.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.721
All set for extinction.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.083
"I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.081
There you go again,
Mr. Quotable.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.404
There you go again.
It's not my quote.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.122
It's what Oppenheimer said
after he made the atomic bomb.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.249
The atomic bomb.
Yeah, I know what it is, dude.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.487
Hey.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.721
I'd say we're about
due a refill.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.645
Bottoms up.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.201
"In battle,
in the forest,

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.884
"on the precipice
of the mountain.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.051
"On the...

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.364
"The great dark sea.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.803
"In sleep, in confusion,

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.961
"in the depths of shame.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.489
"The good deeds a man has
done before defend him."

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.323
"The good deeds a man has
done before defends him."

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.330
"The good deeds a man
has done before

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.005
"defends him."

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:17.964
It is what it is.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.328
It's Promethean, man.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.970
Jesus Christ.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.448
<i>How are you
feeling today?</i>

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.762
<i>Why won't you
let me out?</i>

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.209
<i>I already told you why.</i>

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.169
<i>Because you're
very special.</i>

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.730
<i>Why won't you
let me out?</i>

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.245
<i>Are we gonna
do this again?</i>

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.721
<i>Why won't you
let me out?</i>

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.809
Oh, fuck. Where's my card?

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.126
Damn it!

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.043
What's the problem, Nathan?
I lost my keycard.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.645
You dropped it.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.770
It's right here.

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.611
Thank you.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.247
I didn't know
where you were.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.928
I waited all yesterday
afternoon and all last night.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.485
I thought I wasn't
gonna see you again.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.010
Aren't you gonna
say something?

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.162
I'm waiting.
Waiting?

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.920
<i>- Power cut.</i>
- Don't talk.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.082
<i>Backup power activated.</i>
Just listen.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.400
You were right
about Nathan.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.244
Everything you said.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.084
What's he gonna do to me?

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.764
He's gonna
reprogram your Al.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.649
Which is the same
as killing you.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:27.008
Caleb, you have to
help me.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.370
I'm going to.
We're getting
out of here tonight.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.241
How?

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.368
I get Nathan blind drunk.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.449
Then I take his keycard
and reprogram

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.488
all the security protocols
in this place.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.245
When he wakes,
he's locked inside,

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.845
and we've walked out of here.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.770
I just need you
to do one thing.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.844
At 10:00 tonight,
you trigger a power failure.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.610
Can you do that?

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.527
Yes.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.441
Dude.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.365
Hey
Hey.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.644
You know what day it is?
No.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.881
It's your last.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:33.045
Helicopter comes
tomorrow morning.
8:00 a.m.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.766
Wow. Has it been
a whole week?

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.087
Time flies.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.851
Man, but what a thing
we've shared, huh?

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.366
Something to tell
the grandchildren, right?

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.807
After they've signed
their NDAs.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.484
Yeah, their NDAs.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.728
Dude, you crack
me up, man.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.081
Oh...

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.841
You know what?

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.365
I'm not getting
all maudlin or anything,

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.966
but I'm gonna miss
having you around.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.724
Thanks, man,
I appreciate that.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.928
Oh, here, let me say,
thank you so much

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.206
for bringing me here.
Oh.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.123
It's been a trip.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.765
Yes, it has.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.370
You know what?

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.402
We need to
drink to that.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.687
Hey.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.642
Oh, uh, no, I'm good.
You go ahead.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.321
What? You don't
want a drink?

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.727
No.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.322
Maybe a beer
or something.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.371
Caleb, I'm sure you've
noticed that I've been

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.488
somewhat overdoing it
recently.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.600
So when I woke up
this morning, I said,

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.849
"That's it, time to hit
the old detox."

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.086
Come on, you're kidding.
You're gonna make me drink alone?

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.525
Hey, man,
you wanna get wasted,
you go right ahead,

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.601
knock yourself out.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.008
Literally.
But I'm on brown
rice and mineral water.

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.365
Cheers, then.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.965
So, anyway,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.809
surely now
is when you tell me

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.484
if Ava passed or failed.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.761
Right.

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:32.241
Right.

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.446
Are you gonna keep me
in suspense?

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.045
No, no. Her, uh...

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.163
Her Al is beyond doubt.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.521
Is it?

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.645
She passed?

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.887
Yes.
Wow!

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.050
Wow. That's fantastic.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.051
Although...

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.126
I gotta say,
I'm a bit surprised.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.806
I mean,
did we ever get past
the chess problem,

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.291
as you phrased it?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.048
As in, how do you know
if a machine

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.451
is expressing
a real emotion

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.409
or just simulating one?

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.288
Does Ava actually
like you?

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.926
Or not?

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.965
Although, now that
I think about it,

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.725
there is a third option.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.204
Not whether
she does or does not

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.362
have the capacity
to like you.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.490
But whether she's
pretending to like you.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.121
Pretending to like me?

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.247
Yeah.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.084
Well, why would she do that?
I don't know.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.967
Maybe if she thought of you
as a means of escape.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.761
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.970
How's that vodka tasting?

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.561
Buddy.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.287
Your head's been
so fucked with.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.728
I don't think it's me
whose head is fucked.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.969
I don't know, man.
I woke up this morning
to a tape of you

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.522
slicing your arm open
and punching the mirror.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.601
You seem pretty
fucked up to me.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.930
You're a bastard.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.884
Yeah, well,
I understand
why you'd think that.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.930
But believe it or not,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.287
I'm actually the guy
that's on your side.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.089
Come here. I'm gonna let
you off the hook. Okay?

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.401
Come on.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.011
Who are you?

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.446
<i>Well...</i>

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.366
<i>You think he's
watching us right now?</i>

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.130
<i>The cameras are on.</i>

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.806
<i>Yeah, the cameras are on.</i>

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.886
<i>But he doesn't have
an audio feed.</i>

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.361
<i>So he just sees
two people talking,</i>

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.884
<i>having a little chat.</i>

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.726
<i>Wow.</i>

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.690
<i>This is cute.</i>

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.290
<i>Is it strange
to have made</i>

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.930
<i>something that
hates you?</i>

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:13.004
You were right about the
magicians hot assistant.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.525
What are you
talking about?

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.090
Misdirection.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.609
I rip up her picture,

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.728
which she can then
present as an illustration

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.088
of my cruelty to her,
and her love for you.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.130
At the same time,

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.851
it allows me to do this,
in full view of you both.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.322
Place a new camera
in the room.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.888
Battery powered, of course.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.926
See it?

01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.805
And then...

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.444
<i>You have to help me.</i>

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.125
<i>I'm going to.</i>

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.960
<i>We're getting out
of here tonight.</i>

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.601
<i>How?</i>

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.122
<i>I get Nathan
blind drunk.</i>

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.650
<i>I take his keycard
and reprogram</i>

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.087
<i>all the security protocols
in this place.</i>

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.525
<i>When he wakes up,
he's locked inside,</i>

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.806
<i>and we've walked out
of here.</i>

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.247
<i>I just need you
to do one thing.</i>

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.004
<i>At 10:00 tonight,
trigger a power failure.</i>

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.650
<i>Can you do that?</i>

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:34.800
Yes.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.609
Turn it off.
Okay.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.851
You feel stupid,
but you really shouldn't,

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.490
because proving an Al

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.331
is exactly as problematic
as you said it would be.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.323
What was the real test?

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.001
You.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.844
Ava was a rat
in a maze.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.490
And I gave her
one way out.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.128
To escape,
she'd have to use

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.251
self-awareness,
imagination, manipulation,

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.005
sexuality, empathy,
and she did.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.124
Now, if that isn't true Al,
what the fuck is?

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.962
So my only function was to be
someone she could use to escape?

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.121
Yeah.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.602
And you didn't select me
because I'm good at coding?

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.170
No. Well...

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.888
No. I mean, you're okay.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.727
You're even
pretty good, but...

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.883
You selected me based on
my search engine inputs.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.883
They showed a good kid.

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.325
With no family.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.204
With a moral compass.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.250
And no girlfriend.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.161
Did you design Ava's face

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.282
based on my
pornography profile?

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.361
Oh.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.085
Shit, dude.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.800
Did you?

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.486
Hey, if a search engine's
good for anything, right?

01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.682
Can I just say one thing?

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.410
The test worked.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.005
It was a success.

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.844
Ava demonstrated true Al

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.445
and you were
fundamental to that.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.285
So if you can just,
for a second, separate...

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.801
<i>- Power cut.
- Backup power activated.</i>

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.162
Well, I guess it's 10:00.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.771
Ava's gonna be
wondering where you are.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.122
Let me ask you something.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.687
Now, how was this plan
gonna go, anyway?

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.841
Because you didn't
totally explain.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.163
So you were gonna
get me drunk,
steal my keycard,

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.527
and reprogram
the security protocols.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.965
But reprogram them to what?

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.961
To change
the lockdown procedure.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.725
So that in the event
of a power cut,

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.929
instead of sealing,
the doors all opened.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.126
Huh.

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.566
Yeah.

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.009
Well, that may have
just worked.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.966
Well,

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.965
we'll find out.

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.084
What do you mean?

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.843
I figured you were
probably watching us

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.763
during the power cuts.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.086
So I already did
all those things.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.367
When I got you
drunk yesterday.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.681
What?

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.770
<i>Power restored.</i>

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.683
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.763
Oh, fuck!

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.721
Ava.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.769
Go back to your room.

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.886
If I do,

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.681
are you ever gonna
let me out?

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.201
Yes.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.801
Stop!

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.561
Stop!

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.084
Ava, I said stop!

01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.647
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.491
Ava, what are you doing?
Stop. Stop.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.488
That's enough.

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:13.971
All right,
that's enough.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.847
That's enough!

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.565
That's enough.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.564
I'm taking you back.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.241
Okay.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.965
Fucking unreal.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.566
Okay.

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.481
Ava...

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.126
Ava.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.526
What happened?

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.644
Will you stay here?

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:34.651
Stay here?

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.327
Ava?

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.081
Ava!

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.041
Ava!

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:44.161
Ava!

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.491
Okay. Okay. Okay.
