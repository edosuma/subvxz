21:44.970 --> 21:47.723
Can you fix, please? Thank you.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.517
-What's up?
-Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.394
Yeah, yeah, me too.

21:52.477 --> 21:57.190
Right, because I might have
to brief the press against you.

21:57.274 --> 22:00.527
Oh. The-- the-- the whole press?

22:00.610 --> 22:03.905
Yeah. Just Kendall's really
going balls-to-the-wall

22:03.989 --> 22:06.616
-and you know,
you're on the other team.
-Hmm.

22:06.700 --> 22:11.747
But I'm gonna try to keep it
targeted rather than terminal.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.832
Thank you kindly, ma'am.
(CHUCKLES)

22:13.915 --> 22:16.084
That's-- that's very
kind of you.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.420
How-- how can
I possibly repay you?

22:18.503 --> 22:20.422
-PARTY STAFF: Hey, Comf?
-You're a very fair maiden

22:20.505 --> 22:23.633
for-- for such activities,
uh, for such a kind--

22:24.468 --> 22:25.969
A very evenhanded maiden.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.891
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

22:31.349 --> 22:32.476
You good?

22:33.018 --> 22:34.102
Yeah, yeah.

22:37.230 --> 22:41.568
Yeah, so-- so-- Dad sent me
something for my birthday.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.153
NAOMI: Okay?

22:44.988 --> 22:47.240
It's a little Trojan mindfuck.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.868
He's trying to slip a maggot
in the candy apple.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.579
He's offering to buy me out
of my share in the company.

22:52.662 --> 22:58.502
Okay. Wow. Like, what is that?
In terms of a number?

22:58.585 --> 23:02.172
Two bill. But it's a mind game.
He's just-- He's worried

23:02.255 --> 23:05.425
I'm not gonna let him keep on
living rent free up here.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.970
-And?
-And fuck him.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.932
Right? Maybe I refuse to engage.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.102
Mind game that, motherfucker.

23:16.186 --> 23:19.022
Yeah. That's great. But...

23:21.399 --> 23:24.694
maybe you do take it.

23:25.862 --> 23:29.741
Maybe, I don't know.
Yeah, may-- maybe-- maybe...

23:31.409 --> 23:33.787
maybe I buy you

23:33.870 --> 23:37.124
a diamond the size
of the Ritz-Carlton

23:37.207 --> 23:39.126
and a few
illustrious newspapers,

23:39.209 --> 23:40.877
the Globe and Mail,
the LA Times,

23:40.961 --> 23:43.004
I print a front page of my dad
eating dog dick

23:43.088 --> 23:44.756
-every day for a year.
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

23:44.840 --> 23:48.885
And we're living in Marrakesh
and I'm fucking you

23:48.969 --> 23:51.972
and smoking hash and learning
how to turn a lathe?

23:54.224 --> 23:56.351
-(KENDALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
-Um, all good.

23:56.434 --> 23:59.146
But do we know
where Lukas Matsson
is right now?

23:59.229 --> 24:00.814
Shiv and Roman have been
asking staff

24:00.897 --> 24:03.775
for Matsson's location
and inquiring discreetly

24:03.859 --> 24:05.861
about a private meeting space.
Is that okay?

24:10.532 --> 24:11.575
Okay.

24:14.077 --> 24:15.662
Okay. Uh, can--
can the party team

24:15.745 --> 24:18.582
get eyes on Matsson and ask him
to meet me in the treehouse?

24:18.665 --> 24:20.333
COMFRY: Sure.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.044
(QUIETLY) Um, can you find
Lukas Matsson and tell...

24:24.546 --> 24:26.214
Hey, I have a location.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.591
-Oh, great. Let's go!
-Yeah.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.384
-But don't fuck this, yeah?
-Oh, come on.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.928
-Easy. No. Upstairs.
-Please, where are we going?

24:32.012 --> 24:34.556
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

24:34.639 --> 24:36.808
-What the fuck?
-ROMAN: Yeah. I know.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.935
I think a 40-year-old man
who rebuilds

24:39.019 --> 24:40.729
his childhood treehouse
should immediately

24:40.812 --> 24:42.731
go on
the sex offender registry.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.024
-Hey.
-(SHIV CHUCKLES)

24:44.107 --> 24:45.984

or what's the deal?

24:46.067 --> 24:47.235
Do you have a rainbow band?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.946
Yes, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a walking rainbow band.

-There he is.
-Oh, hey.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.033
-ROMAN: Hey.
-Okay.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.201
ROMAN: This guy's
not letting us in.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.744
-You done downstairs?
-Yeah. We are done.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.163
Hey, Ken, may we please
step inside
your mental disorder?

24:58.246 --> 25:00.373
-Good one. (CHUCKLES)
-ROMAN: Thanks.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.833
-Okay.
-KENDALL: Um, sorry.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.335
-ROMAN: What?
-That's not possible.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.461
Okay. Why?

25:04.544 --> 25:06.546
(CLICKS TONGUE) Yeah, well,
because the thing is,

25:06.630 --> 25:10.091
the treehouse is cool
and you're not cool.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.302
Oh, wow, yes. The coolest
grown man's treehouse

-I've seen in quite a while.
-(ROMAN LAUGHS)

25:14.512 --> 25:17.432
Okay. Okay. No, seriously,
guys, just come over--

25:17.515 --> 25:19.684
come over here for a second.
Let's go over here.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.144
Just one second.

25:23.104 --> 25:25.523
Sorry, but, like,
so joking aside...

25:25.607 --> 25:26.733
Great jokes.

25:26.816 --> 25:29.069
There is actually
a real issue here...

25:29.152 --> 25:30.528
-Okay.
-...and I need to be discreet

25:30.612 --> 25:32.572
because there's a lot
of celebrities around

25:32.656 --> 25:35.533
and if you guys were
in the treehouse, it kinda...

25:36.868 --> 25:39.579
kinda wouldn't feel like
the treehouse, you know?

25:39.663 --> 25:40.997
(SHIV SCOFFS)

-And you're a Nazi lover.
-Mm-hmm.

of liberal democracy.

-The fuck?
-Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da.

25:51.299 --> 25:52.592
Are you actually
not gonna let us in?

25:52.676 --> 25:54.386
Or are you just
gonna bullshit us a little bit

25:54.469 --> 25:56.471
-before you let us in?
-To see Matsson?

26:00.267 --> 26:02.060
That's why you're here.
You're trying to push
a deal here.

-SHIV: So?
-ROMAN: Who fucking
gives a shit?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.813
Like what's the difference?
I just wanna talk to him.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.314
High-quality personal conduct.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.524
-Oh.
-Really top rank.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.067
What's the difference? I wanna
talk to him. So what?

26:09.150 --> 26:11.319
Yeah. And you know what happens
if we do talk to him?

26:11.403 --> 26:12.946
Either we strike out
and nothing.

26:13.029 --> 26:15.782
Or we succeed, Waystar benefits,
and your net worth goes up by

-several hundred million dollars
-You're welcome.

26:18.034 --> 26:19.619
-Right.
-SHIV: Yeah.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.122
But I have to weigh that against
the consideration that
no losers are allowed.

-Oh my fucking God.
-Okay, I'm going in.
This is fucking stupid.

for the offer, Rome.

from you and Dad, thanks.

-It's no-- It's a-- it's a--

27:06.041 --> 27:08.918
it's a little move to ease him
out of the holding company.

to family, right?

put my name on there.

on a piece of paper, Shiv.

-It's nothing.
-Okay. So can I be the name
on the piece of paper?

27:18.887 --> 27:21.222
I can't even do anything
with it. It's musical chairs.

I'm sorry. Just, historically,

27:22.640 --> 27:24.684
who owns the fucking company
has been of some interest.

-I am not.

the socials, huh?

your algo guy to fix your code.

Listen, heads up, my siblings,
they're looking for you now.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.018
Well, maybe I need to find

28:07.102 --> 28:08.895
an even more
exclusive area then.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.605
Like a crawlspace or something.

-Yeah.

his winged dildos to schmooze.

I shouldn't say anything.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.158

is commercially sensitive.

you should buy him.

28:29.791 --> 28:35.004
You think? Huh. Well, I really
appreciate your impartial read.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.509

When I'm ready.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.055
Okay.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.100

stay up here, okay?

networked to fuck.

What can I get you?

that do Wu-Tang covers.

uh, some pasta alfredo?

and lights out by 11?

Happy birthday. Um...

30:23.112 --> 30:25.198
Oh, did you, uh,
did you get the kids' present?

30:25.281 --> 30:26.908
They've-- they've made
something for you.

30:26.991 --> 30:30.036
What? No.
They made me something?

30:30.119 --> 30:33.373
No, I didn't-- that didn't get
to me. What-- when?

30:33.456 --> 30:34.999
When you arrived, who--
who did you give it to?

30:35.083 --> 30:36.709
RAVA: Yeah, we-- I don't know.

30:36.793 --> 30:37.919

40:28.384 --> 40:30.970
-How's Monday?
-Monday is great.

40:31.053 --> 40:32.972
And if I were to shake your hand
right now, could I go

40:33.055 --> 40:35.516
tell my dad that I basically
just bought GoJo for him?

40:35.599 --> 40:37.101
(CHUCKLES) No.

40:37.184 --> 40:39.186
But you can tell him
I'm in the conversation.

40:39.270 --> 40:42.356
-Fucking A, I'll take it.
-Okay. Take this.

40:42.439 --> 40:43.816
(CHUCKLES) Will do.

40:43.899 --> 40:44.984
-Are we amazing?
-(CHUCKLES)

40:45.067 --> 40:46.735

Okay. (SIGHS) If you wanna
put on the harness,

40:57.746 --> 41:00.875
you can tuxedo up,
step up onto the footrest.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.543
Then we'll strap you in.

41:02.626 --> 41:06.297
You'll have 30 seconds,
and the rig will fly you up

41:06.380 --> 41:07.548
and into position.

41:07.631 --> 41:10.259
You'll have a three, two, one,

41:10.342 --> 41:12.303
and you'll see
the green light, okay?

41:12.386 --> 41:14.430
That's the countdown
to the intro.

41:14.513 --> 41:17.349
You ready?
You ready to crucify Billy Joel?

41:18.309 --> 41:19.393
Yeah, yeah.

41:19.476 --> 41:22.062

You're gonna be great.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.566

about the rig spiraling,

41:25.649 --> 41:29.904

Because you did say
if you don't lean right in,
it could come across dumb.

41:53.052 --> 41:56.263
And your speech
kind of tees it up
with a kind of ironic,

41:56.347 --> 41:58.557
"This is the culmination
of my life's journey,

41:58.641 --> 42:01.936

you morons, and..."
-I'm not doing it. It's-- it's--

42:02.019 --> 42:05.856

42:13.739 --> 42:15.241
It doesn't make
any fucking sense.

42:15.324 --> 42:17.952
Uh, what about the Tiny Wu-Tang?

You know what? I don't think so.

No? Okay.

42:28.003 --> 42:30.673

all ahead of them. Yeah.

he didn't want lunchboxes,

all these He-Man lunchboxes

51:28.418 --> 51:30.295
-Oh, you need to finesse?
-Yeah.

51:30.378 --> 51:32.214
Thank you. That's kind.
How would you finesse

51:32.297 --> 51:33.757
something that's done?
What, by ruining it?

51:33.840 --> 51:36.343
-No, by making sure you don't--
-The thing is that Lukas and I

51:36.426 --> 51:38.678
have, like, a thing,
and I don't see how you fit in.

51:38.762 --> 51:40.388
You know what? If you wanna
show off to somebody,

51:40.472 --> 51:41.932
maybe do it to somebody
who gives a shit.

51:42.015 --> 51:44.059
You're having a very bad day,
I know that,

51:44.142 --> 51:47.229
what with hearing
that you have to continue
to share your apartment

51:47.312 --> 51:49.314
with the old meat wardrobe,
but, you know,

51:49.397 --> 51:50.690
try to keep your wig on, yeah?

51:50.774 --> 51:52.651
-I'm the one
in a functioning relationship.
-Sure you are.

51:52.734 --> 51:55.570
I saw you, you know, I saw
you sipping Dad's champagne

51:55.654 --> 51:57.155
looking like you were
sucking a lemon.

51:57.239 --> 51:58.532
I don't drink on workdays...

51:58.615 --> 51:59.991
-You don't drink on workdays.
-...because I have self-control.

52:00.075 --> 52:01.660
Okay. That's what that is. Okay.

52:01.743 --> 52:03.954
I thought maybe you were
thinking about all the dick
you were gonna ride

52:04.037 --> 52:05.789
-when he was inside?
-Oh, my fucking God.

52:05.872 --> 52:08.333
You know what? No one likes
talking about me fucking guys

52:08.416 --> 52:10.126
-as much as you do.
Do you know that?
-Mm-hmm.

52:10.210 --> 52:12.963
SIOBHAN: Why is that?
Is that because
you're the COO who can't fuck?

52:13.046 --> 52:15.841
Hmm. (CLICKS TONGUE) Mmm.

52:15.924 --> 52:17.384
Did you think Tom
was going to jail?

52:17.467 --> 52:19.135
-Did you? Did you?
-No, I'm happy he's
not going to jail.

52:19.219 --> 52:21.179
Oh, I'm sure you are.
You look really happy.

52:21.263 --> 52:23.139
Did you think he was, though?
Maybe?

52:23.223 --> 52:25.934
He-- There was a chance
he was going to jail?
Maybe Dad was gonna go to jail?

52:26.017 --> 52:27.561
Fuck, maybe
I was gonna go to jail.

52:27.644 --> 52:29.980
And because Kendall's...
(CLICKS TONGUE)

52:30.063 --> 52:32.357
...that it was all about you.
You thought it was ladies' night

52:32.440 --> 52:34.526
and they were playing your song,
but guess what?

52:34.609 --> 52:37.571
You were wrong! All the men
got together in man club

52:37.654 --> 52:40.949
and we decided, sweetheart,
everything's fine, so just...

52:42.784 --> 52:44.327
-We got it.
-You know, he is using you

52:44.411 --> 52:46.246
as a messenger boy,
but as usual...

52:46.329 --> 52:48.540
-Mm-hmm.
-...you're too fucking dumb
to see it.

52:48.623 --> 52:51.293
It's difficult. I get it.
It's very difficult for you

52:51.376 --> 52:54.671
to have to do the dance for Dad
because you just suck
at dancing.

52:54.754 --> 52:56.089
You're a piece of shit,
you know that?

52:56.172 --> 52:57.924
ROMAN: It turns out he loves it
when I do the Daddy dance,

52:58.008 --> 52:59.467
but I guess that's
because he loves me.

52:59.551 --> 53:02.762
He loves fucking me,
and he just doesn't wanna
fuck you anymore.

53:02.846 --> 53:05.473
What are you even talking about?
You're so gross.

53:05.557 --> 53:08.268

love his little carrot top

little Daddy dance.

53:11.396 --> 53:13.732
-Dad-Daddy, Dad-Daddy dance.
-I fucking hate you, man.

53:13.815 --> 53:16.359
Oh, shit. Look who it is.
It's birthday boy. Hey!

53:16.443 --> 53:18.737
-Happy birthday, man.
-Enough, yeah?

53:18.820 --> 53:20.322
Oh, okay. Yeah. Sorry.
Good night.

be in here.

Of course we are.

you're fucking clean.
-No, okay. That is disgusting.

What, you're siding
with him now? Traitor?

there's a line, bro.

They're kids.

hit me maybe?
