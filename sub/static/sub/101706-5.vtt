you change your mind.

how hard I'm going,

they're gonna go
that much harder.

asked me to see you.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.639
Step in here?

04:53.118 --> 04:55.730
It's a sensitive
subject, and I'd like

04:55.773 --> 04:57.775
to ask you respectfully.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.822
Okay.

05:00.865 --> 05:03.694
You remember after
the '92 riots, the LAPD tried

05:03.738 --> 05:05.522
to improve relations
with the Black community,

05:05.566 --> 05:08.525
made a big push to recruit
more Black officers?

05:08.569 --> 05:10.527
I remember that it was
a PR stunt that didn't do much

05:10.571 --> 05:12.050
to improve the gap
between Black and blue.

05:12.094 --> 05:13.704
And there's a reason
that Black recruitment

05:13.748 --> 05:15.489
fell back down
after that initial push.

05:15.532 --> 05:16.925
'Cause people didn't see
any real change

05:16.968 --> 05:18.927
in how the LAPD
approached the community.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.190
No arguments here.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.627
In any case, turns out,
if you hire all at once...

05:23.671 --> 05:25.412
They retire all at once.

05:25.455 --> 05:26.848
The number of Black officers

05:26.891 --> 05:29.198
will drop 50%
in the next five years.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.939
And considering recent events,
that's not a good look.

05:30.982 --> 05:34.072
Or good policing.So now the mayor wants my help.

they can make with a career

permanent, it's a stop-gap.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.296
after his reparations op-ed
came out.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.124
But it's still a big step fora bunch of keyboard gangsters

10:03.167 --> 10:05.169
to mail an actual pipe bomb. Imean, who would take that leap?

10:05.213 --> 10:08.346
There's one group that keeps me
up at night. Fairly new.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.174
Branches all over
Southern California.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.742
A more radical, more
militant offshoot of the KKK.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.831
They call themselves
"the Imperial Dukes."

10:14.875 --> 10:16.746
This thread was
created on their forum

10:16.790 --> 10:18.835
moments after the news of
the Gates bombing broke.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.837
We're still working
to verify its legitimacy.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.360
"Gates got what was his.
I've done my part

10:22.404 --> 10:24.058
"to protect
what's rightfully ours.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.973
Who has the courage to join me?"

10:26.016 --> 10:28.236
Let's hope nobody.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.066
RHD sent a name?STREET:Security camera

10:32.109 --> 10:34.372
at the TransSend parking lotcaught a suspect

10:34.416 --> 10:36.026
exiting his vehiclewith the package in hand.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.854
They ran the plates.
Car's registered

10:37.898 --> 10:40.030
to Ronald Coogan from
Scottsdale, Arizona.

10:40.074 --> 10:43.207
Ron's son, Harry, is
an engineering student at USC.

10:43.251 --> 10:45.732
Address?RHD's still working.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.385
Scratch that.
Just came in.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.866
He rents a house
in University Park

10:49.910 --> 10:51.302
about a half milefrom the TransSend store.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.956
All right, I'll tell
Hicks and Hondo.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.784
You two grab Chris
and Stevens.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.264
Let's be ready
when that warrant comes in.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.358
LAPD!
Don't move!LAPD! Two, two, two, two!

11:03.401 --> 11:04.881
Clear!Hands on your head!Clear right!

11:04.925 --> 11:06.883
Closet only, clear.What's-what's going on?

11:06.927 --> 11:08.058
Deac.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.278
Look.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.888
Doesn't really scream

11:11.932 --> 11:13.585
Klan member, does it?Klan member?

11:13.629 --> 11:15.065
Does this have something to do
with Shawna?

11:15.109 --> 11:16.414
Can somebody please tell me
what's going on?

11:16.458 --> 11:18.068
HONDO [over radio]:
Upstairs is clear.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.809
Roommates aren't home.
No sign of explosives.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.202
CHRIS:
Same. Rest of the house
is clean.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.072
Where'd you stash
the explosives, Harry?

11:22.116 --> 11:24.553
Ex-Explosives?LAPD has you

11:24.596 --> 11:27.077
on camera delivering
a package bomb

11:27.121 --> 11:29.384
to Gates Realty Group.
You want to explain?Package bomb?

11:31.038 --> 11:33.040
Oh, no, no, no.Easy.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.129
I work for Choreable--
the app--

11:35.172 --> 11:37.174
doing odd jobs and errands.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.480
Two nights ago
I got a gig.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.221
I met up
with this weird guy.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.049
He was rambling,
he was panicked.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.529
He paid me a hundred dollars
just to drop off some packages,

11:44.573 --> 11:46.270
no questions asked.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.358
I-I figured they were
just drugs...

11:47.402 --> 11:48.272
Hold on, hold on.
Packages?

11:48.316 --> 11:49.491
There was more than one?

11:54.148 --> 11:55.932
The Choreable customer
instructed Harry

11:55.976 --> 11:58.413
to drop off the second package
to a separate TransSend store.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.284
Luckily, he kept the receipt
with the tracking number.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.503
The package was delivered
this morning

12:01.546 --> 12:02.896
to the office
of a defense attorney,

12:02.939 --> 12:04.593
Megan Brown.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.987
We tried calling her office,
but the machine picked up.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.553
The rest of the team is en route
with Davis and the bomb squad.

12:08.597 --> 12:09.990
Patrol will meet you there.

12:10.033 --> 12:12.122
Tan, work with them
to set up a perimeter

12:12.166 --> 12:13.820
while Hondo finds the package.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.343
Meanwhile, we'll track down
Megan Brown's cell number

12:15.386 --> 12:17.519
and try to reach her.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.303
Just get there quick.Roger that!

12:19.347 --> 12:20.522
[siren wailing]

12:24.221 --> 12:26.441
Mom, you got something.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.617
Oh, probably those new
business cards I ordered.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.968
Finally. You mind
opening it for me?

12:32.012 --> 12:34.318
Just need to grab
those papers,

12:34.362 --> 12:36.494
and then we can grab
some dinner.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.495
Howlin' Ray's?

12:37.539 --> 12:38.496
You got it, kiddo.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.368
[phone ringing]

12:42.196 --> 12:43.545
We're closed.

12:51.205 --> 12:51.901
[tires screech]

12:54.121 --> 12:56.384
Set the perimeter.Start clearing civilians.On it!

12:59.474 --> 13:00.867
Hey, little man.
I'm a police officer.

13:00.910 --> 13:01.998
I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.173
I need you to be
extremely careful

13:03.217 --> 13:04.435
with that box
in your hands.

13:04.479 --> 13:05.523
Jack, are you talking
to somebody?

13:05.567 --> 13:06.916
Ma'am, ma'am,
stay right there.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.570
I'm LAPD.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.572
Jack.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.226
Listen to me,
all right?

13:12.269 --> 13:13.662
That box
you're holding

13:13.705 --> 13:16.926
is very dangerous,
and I need you to put it down.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.145
Jack, listen
to the officer.

13:18.188 --> 13:20.625
No. No, no, slowly,
Jack, Jack, slowly.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.410
Slowly.

13:22.453 --> 13:25.065
Okay, watch my hand.
I'm gonna lower my hand

13:25.108 --> 13:26.718
And I want you to match
my speed, okay?

13:26.762 --> 13:28.024
Let's do it together.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.243
Slowly, Jack.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.680
Slowly. Really slow,
really slow. Slow, slow.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.378
Keep going,
keep going.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.293
Slow. There you go.

13:36.337 --> 13:37.555
Almost there. Come on.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.079
Slow, slow, slow.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.384
There you go.

13:40.428 --> 13:41.472
Good job.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.734
Is anyone else
in there?

13:42.778 --> 13:44.171
Uh, just the cleaning crew.Okay, grab them,

13:44.214 --> 13:46.129
head out the back entrance.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.392
I'll send someone
for you. Go!
Okay.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.101
Package is secure,

14:01.144 --> 14:02.450
with robot moving
to containment vessel.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.253
Package delivered.

14:30.391 --> 14:31.435
DAVIS:
Three,

14:31.479 --> 14:33.568
two, one--
fire in the hole!

14:36.136 --> 14:37.137
[steam hisses]

14:41.445 --> 14:43.186
Code 4.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.145
Bomb successfully neutralized.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.279
HONDO:
Davis and the bomb squad
are pulling an all-nighter,

14:49.323 --> 14:51.455
piecing together
as much of the bomb as they can

14:51.499 --> 14:52.500
to see what they can find.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.110
Commander, why does it feel

14:54.154 --> 14:55.459
like this has nothing to do
with guys in white hoods?

14:55.503 --> 14:57.113
Maybe 'cause it doesn't.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.289
Lynch and the FBI traced
the comments this morning

14:59.333 --> 15:00.987
to an IP address in Pushkin.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.597
It's nothing more
than Russian trolls

15:02.640 --> 15:04.338
trying to incite violence.All right,
so if it's not

15:04.381 --> 15:06.427
the Imperial Dukes,
who is behind these bombs?

15:06.470 --> 15:08.168
What about college
stoner dude?

15:08.211 --> 15:09.517
He dealt with the bomber
directly.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.214
RHD get anything from him?

15:11.258 --> 15:12.781
HICKS:A description.
But it looks like

15:12.824 --> 15:14.565
the suspect used a fake name
and a Visa gift card

15:14.609 --> 15:16.002
for his Choreable account.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.307
Meanwhile, Burrows is looking

15:17.351 --> 15:19.135
into any connection

15:19.179 --> 15:21.181
between the intended victims:
Jeff Gates, Megan Brown.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.834
Nothing so far.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.706
A tech just pulled
this voice mail

15:24.749 --> 15:26.403
off Gates'
destroyed office phone.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.058
The call was made last week
from a pay phone.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.408
MAN [recorded]:
I know what you're doing.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.019
I see right through you.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.456
Your-your "friend" on the radio.The woman on the bus.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.501
What did she tell you about me?

15:37.545 --> 15:39.808
You only sent them because...

15:39.851 --> 15:42.158
I knew what you did
with my phone.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.333
Following me.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.596
Always following me!

15:45.640 --> 15:47.598
But I know, you-you and Brown

15:47.642 --> 15:49.731
and the others, I know
exactly what you're doing.

15:49.774 --> 15:52.342
Either you stop it, or I will.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.214
Guy's off his nut.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.780
"You, Brown and
the others."

15:55.824 --> 15:57.434
Sounds like
he's far from finished.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.480
Stoner dude said
the guy who hired him

15:59.523 --> 16:02.265
to deliver the package
was rambling, paranoid.

16:02.309 --> 16:05.094
It could be mental illness.
Disorganized speech.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.269
Persecutory delusions.
It all tracks

16:06.313 --> 16:07.270
with schizophrenia.

16:07.314 --> 16:08.663
If he targeted
Gates and Brown

16:08.706 --> 16:10.447
based on delusion,
that means his next target

16:10.491 --> 16:11.709
could be absolutely anybody.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.368
Officer Alonso, ready?

16:18.412 --> 16:20.631
Welcome to the 38th annual
master gunner competition.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.590
This is a time trial.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.331
Fastest time wins.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.767
Each target
is either a suspect,

16:25.810 --> 16:27.638
a suspect holding a hostage,
or a civilian.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.205
Assess the threats.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.728
Eliminate the suspects.

16:30.772 --> 16:33.340
There are 14 suspects
on this course.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.776
Use your primary
for the first six,

16:34.819 --> 16:36.125
reloading after three.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.692
Switch to your secondary.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.694
Dominant hand after six. Reload.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.304
Nondominant
for the last two.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.523
You will receive
time penalties

16:42.566 --> 16:44.133
for any of the following:

16:44.177 --> 16:45.091
reloading too early,

16:45.134 --> 16:46.353
reloading too late,

16:46.396 --> 16:47.571
hitting targets
outside critical zones,

16:47.615 --> 16:48.746
and improper technique.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.139
You hit a civilian

16:50.183 --> 16:51.445
or a hostage, automatic DQ.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.621
You got it? Time starts
on the buzzer and ends

16:53.664 --> 16:54.796
when you hit the last target.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.319
Good luck.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.582
And remember... smooth is fast.

have told you that.

and Street and Stevens?Well, I can't
say much.

18:48.605 --> 18:49.954

they went this morning,

18:49.998 --> 18:51.521
and Street's up
in the evening group.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.349
But that was damn
near perfect,

18:53.393 --> 18:55.743

for anyone to beat that time.

This have anything to do with
the voice mail from the bomber?

19:25.381 --> 19:27.731
Hondo mentioned you seemed
a little rattled by it.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.864
Yeah, it brought back
some old memories.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.431
My dad...

19:34.390 --> 19:36.914
got diagnosed with schizophrenia
just after I was born.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.917
Oh, man. I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.702
That must have been
really tough.It was under control

19:41.745 --> 19:43.791
most of the time;
other times, it wasn't.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.097
And hearing that guy
on the call, his anger,

19:46.141 --> 19:50.101
his paranoia, reminded me
of some of those other times.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.364
I don't mean
to dump this on you.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.540
No, no, it's all good.
And if you want to talk

19:53.583 --> 19:55.585
about it more,I'm around.I appreciate it.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.761
I just want to get
my mind off it.

for the location

19:59.937 --> 20:02.375
of that mail bomber,
I was, uh...

20:02.418 --> 20:04.681
gonna go pound a bag.
If you think it'll help,

20:04.725 --> 20:06.422
I could use a sparring partner.

Yeah. I'll meet you in the ring.

interesting talk

20:20.915 --> 20:23.091
with Lieutenant Lynch
about a recruitment campaign

20:23.134 --> 20:25.311
to try and pull in
more Black cops.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.748
I was hoping to get your opinion
about whether I should do it.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.967
[sighs]Wow.
What?

20:30.011 --> 20:33.057
She already asked
you, didn't she?

20:33.101 --> 20:35.973
Yeah, and it looks like
she's going down the list.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.975
[laughs]: Which
is not very long.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.499
Why'd you say no?

20:41.544 --> 20:44.112
[takes deep breath]

20:44.155 --> 20:46.636
Honestly?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.725
Because I'm exhausted.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.427
Where were you in '92
when things popped off?

20:55.689 --> 20:57.691
Um, we were still living
in Houston.

20:57.734 --> 20:58.996
I'd just turned six.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.563
Hmm.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.391
I remember my parents were glued

21:02.435 --> 21:03.697
to the TV that whole week.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.047
Well, I was right here
in South L.A.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.918
And I didn't have
to turn on my TV,

21:07.962 --> 21:10.051
'cause I could watch it all
from my backyard.

21:10.094 --> 21:13.359
And this summer it was like
I was watching a rerun.

21:13.402 --> 21:16.013
Watts and Rodney King,

21:16.057 --> 21:19.060
and now George Floyd,
Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.367
It's the same old show,
and it doesn't stop.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.107
And the gap between Black

21:23.151 --> 21:24.805
and blue is even wider now.

21:26.589 --> 21:29.505
Erika, I turned down Lynch

21:29.549 --> 21:32.421
because I don't know how I can
look a Black kid in the eye

21:32.465 --> 21:33.857
and tell them
they can make things change

21:33.901 --> 21:35.903
by joining the LAPD.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.774
Because it's not true.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.864
What is the truth, then?

21:44.041 --> 21:47.001
That your friends
might stop talking to you.

21:47.044 --> 21:50.526
Even your own father
might be ashamed of what you do.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.181
Or there could be days when
you don't feel like wearing

21:53.224 --> 21:54.922
this uniform
because it's the same color

21:54.965 --> 21:57.098
that some bastard wore
in Louisville and Minneapolis.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.149
Before I joined SWAT,

22:05.193 --> 22:07.630
I read this article.

22:07.674 --> 22:10.720
It was a profile
about Raymont Harris.

22:10.764 --> 22:14.115
It talked about how his life
was spiraling out of control

22:14.158 --> 22:17.161
until a SWAT sergeant
named Daniel Harrelson

22:17.205 --> 22:18.728
pulled him out of it

22:18.772 --> 22:21.122
and got him back
on the right track.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.037
Where's Raymont now?

22:23.080 --> 22:25.561
He's a junior at UCLA.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.737
Chemical engineering major.

22:27.781 --> 22:30.914
See, I remember reading
that article and thinking,

22:30.958 --> 22:34.265
" Thatis the kind of cop
that I want to be."

22:34.309 --> 22:37.007
And I get it. You've been
fighting all of this

22:37.051 --> 22:38.966
a lot longer than I have.
But what is the alternative?

22:39.009 --> 22:40.620
We just throw up our hands?

22:40.663 --> 22:42.709
Let the number of Black cops
drop to zero?

22:42.752 --> 22:45.059
What does the world
look like then?

22:45.102 --> 22:48.497
Who's there
for the next Raymont?

22:52.022 --> 22:54.503
[phone buzzes]

22:57.724 --> 22:59.769
Looks like RHD has a lead
on our bomber.

22:59.813 --> 23:02.250
I got to run.Yeah, go get him.

23:08.343 --> 23:09.953
BURROWS:
Davis

23:09.997 --> 23:11.781
and the bomb squad
managed to piece together

23:11.825 --> 23:14.871
enough bomb fragments
to pull a partial print.

23:14.915 --> 23:17.221
Charles Pierce.
We rushed a subpoena

23:17.265 --> 23:20.311
for his medical records
from L.A. Regional Hospital.Well, Tan was on the money.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.835
Pierce has been
in and out of treatment

23:21.878 --> 23:23.619
for schizophrenia
for several years.

23:23.663 --> 23:24.925
A whole host
of paranoid delusions,

23:24.968 --> 23:26.796
but no priors,
no history of violence.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.624
Well, then, what triggered him
to mail a bunch of pipe bombs?

23:28.668 --> 23:29.669
He was living with his brother,

23:29.712 --> 23:31.975
Leo, and Leo's wife, Brenda.

23:32.019 --> 23:34.325
Seems like the only family
that he had.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.979
Leo Pierce died six months ago.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.633
DEACON:
Up until two
months ago, he was

23:37.677 --> 23:39.722
still living in their garage,
and then he just vanished.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.289
Brenda Pierce
filed a missing persons report,

23:41.332 --> 23:42.812
but still no sign of him.HONDO:
Let's pay

23:42.856 --> 23:43.857
the sister-in-law a visit.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.641
See if she knows anything.No need.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.121
She's already on her way over.

23:48.339 --> 23:50.254
When Leo and I got married,

23:50.298 --> 23:52.343
Charlie was such a happy guy.

23:52.387 --> 23:55.651
He was, like, carefree.

23:55.695 --> 23:59.133
But I guess he hasn't been
that Charlie in a long time.

23:59.176 --> 24:01.135
When did you noticesomething off?Just after

24:01.178 --> 24:03.006
his 24th birthday. We couldn't
reach him for three days.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.182
And it turned out Charlie had...

24:05.226 --> 24:08.534
um, destroyed the battery
in his phone.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.014
He swore the mailman
was using it

24:11.058 --> 24:13.930
to gather evidence
against him.Evidence of what?

24:13.974 --> 24:16.716
Nothing.
He never did anything wrong.

24:16.759 --> 24:19.849
He was... He was hearing voices.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.634
He was seeing things
that weren't there.

24:21.677 --> 24:24.332
But he absolutely refused

24:24.375 --> 24:26.247
to see someone.Well, asking for help,

24:26.290 --> 24:28.118
that can be the hardest part.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.642
BRENDA:
Yeah, I mean, I wish that
were true for Charlie.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.078
Eventually, he
missed so much work

24:31.121 --> 24:33.602
that he lost his job,
so Leo let him move in

24:33.646 --> 24:35.299
to the garage on the condition
that he see a doctor,

24:35.343 --> 24:36.997
so he finally agreed.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.955
The diagnosis was schizophrenia.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.957
And the doctor
put him on medication,

24:41.001 --> 24:43.569
and a-actually,
it helped for a little while.

24:43.612 --> 24:44.961
Eventually,
he would go off the meds,

24:45.005 --> 24:47.094
and then we'd repeat
the whole cycle.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.052
And that's been our lives
for the last seven years.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.054
And then Leo got sick.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.360
How did Charlie react
to your husband's death?

24:52.403 --> 24:54.841
He was devastated.

24:54.884 --> 24:57.191
But, I mean, he seemed
to be holding it together.

24:57.234 --> 25:00.411
He was even making some money
through an app.

25:00.455 --> 25:01.891
He was shopping for people,

25:01.935 --> 25:04.938
and, you know,
he was running errands.

25:04.981 --> 25:05.939
That kind of thing.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.723
Choreable.Yeah.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.333
The whole thing started
again. The delusions,

25:09.377 --> 25:11.335
the paranoia.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.773
Um...

25:17.124 --> 25:19.735
I-I promised Leo
that I would look after Charlie,

25:19.779 --> 25:22.259
but, um...

25:22.303 --> 25:25.262
It just wore me to the bone.Mrs. Pierce,

25:25.306 --> 25:28.048
is there anywhere that you can
think of that Charlie might be?

25:28.091 --> 25:29.745
Or anyone that he might have
reached out to for help?

25:29.789 --> 25:32.095
BRENDA:
I have no clue.

25:32.139 --> 25:34.097
After he disappeared, I put
all of his things in boxes.

25:34.141 --> 25:36.186
There's...
They're in the back of my truck.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.798
Maybe you'll find
something there.

25:41.322 --> 25:43.454
She sounded like
she's had a rough go of it.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.108
For some time now.

25:45.152 --> 25:46.719
This thing can tear
families apart.

25:46.762 --> 25:47.981
Almost destroyed mine.

25:48.024 --> 25:50.418
Dad had trouble
holding down a job.

25:50.461 --> 25:53.377
Mom was working three gigs
just to make ends meet.

25:53.421 --> 25:55.075
Lot of times, it was up to
me and my brother, Jacob,

25:55.118 --> 25:58.078
to look after him. Towards
the end, it was just me.

25:58.121 --> 26:00.950
How old were you?When he passed? 16.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.213
Jacob was 20. He
was at college.

26:03.257 --> 26:06.086
Visited Dad three
times in two years.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.262
Found any excuse to
avoid seeing him.

26:08.305 --> 26:11.482
My father and I
have got our issues,

26:11.526 --> 26:14.181
but I can't imagine
cutting him out like that.

26:14.224 --> 26:16.313
Yeah, I never held my dad's
worst days against him.

26:16.357 --> 26:17.967
He was just sick.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.317
But Jacob
would never look past it.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.493
It's a big reason we
don't talk anymore.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.670
DEACON:
It's crazy to think
that's the same person

26:24.713 --> 26:26.497
that we heard
on that voice mail last night.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.456
It's like a switch
just flipped.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.459
Here we go.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.243
A burner phone.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.028
Probably thought his cell
was being tracked again.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.246
Yeah, well, the number's

26:36.290 --> 26:37.857
still listed
on the SIM card.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.252
Burrows. Hey, it's Deacon.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.907
Hey, listen, I think I know
how we can find Charlie.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.826
Just finished going through
the patient information

26:50.870 --> 26:52.132
in Charlie's medical
history. Unfortunately,

26:52.175 --> 26:53.437
it sounds like
the one person who might have

26:53.481 --> 26:55.004
gotten through to him
died six months ago.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.311
His brother, Leo.
If we do find him,

26:57.354 --> 27:00.488
how do we resolve
this nonlethally?[phone vibrating]

27:00.531 --> 27:02.446
Excuse me. Yeah?

27:02.490 --> 27:04.492
I mean, I guess we try

27:04.535 --> 27:06.450
to convince Charlie
it's all in his head, right?

27:06.494 --> 27:08.539
No, that's only gonna
aggravate him more.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.846
Charlie might be hearing
things, seeing things,

27:10.890 --> 27:12.152
but in his mind,

27:12.195 --> 27:14.023
those things are as real
to him as you and me.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.025
For whatever reason, he's
convinced that Jeff Gates,

27:16.069 --> 27:17.505
Megan Brown and the others
are out to get him.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.072
Best way to buy his trust?

27:19.115 --> 27:21.248
We make him feel safe.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.729
That was Burrows. RHD's been
camping on that phone number

27:23.772 --> 27:26.035
we found from Charlie's burner.
He briefly turned it on.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.385
They tracked it to an apartment
in North Hollywood. Bad news.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.474
He used it to contact Choreable.

27:30.518 --> 27:33.260
He's gonna mail another bomb.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.568
LAPD!LAPD!

27:37.612 --> 27:39.440

CHRIS: Perimeter's clear.20-David to Command. It looks
like Charlie already left

27:48.797 --> 27:51.060
to drop off the package
to the Choreable worker.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.888
Anything in here to
tell us where he went?

27:52.932 --> 27:55.151
Hold on a second.

27:57.980 --> 27:58.938
Guys, check this out.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.983
CHRIS:
24-David to 20-David.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.593
Patrol just found something
at the bus stop down the block

28:02.637 --> 28:04.291
you might want to look at.
Sending photos now.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.424
TAN:
That's why Charlie thought
he was being watched.

28:07.468 --> 28:09.557
So, Megan Brown is staring
at him through his window.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.385
Jeff Gates is
at his bus stop.

28:11.428 --> 28:12.908
HONDO:
All right, split up.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.214
Collect any images,
any ads,

28:14.257 --> 28:15.781
anything Charlie would see
on a daily basis

28:15.824 --> 28:17.783
that could point us
to his next target.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.828
HICKS:
Command to 20-David.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.177
Burrows just got off the phone

28:21.221 --> 28:23.310
with the Choreable worker
who met up with Charlie.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.529
When he saw
a suspicious-looking package,

28:25.573 --> 28:27.793
he tried to stall, call police.

28:27.836 --> 28:30.447
Charlie must have realized.
He ran off with the bomb.

28:30.491 --> 28:33.276
Charlie might be looking
to deliver the package himself.HONDO: Did the worker

28:33.320 --> 28:35.931
mention where Charlie
wanted him to mail the package?HICKS: Negative.

28:35.975 --> 28:38.281
But he did give us a description
of Charlie's clothing.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.109
Sending it over now.Roger that.

28:40.153 --> 28:43.112
Hey. Found something.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.549
This was in the trash.

28:45.593 --> 28:48.117
Valdez Brothers Auto Repair.HONDO:
I think

28:48.161 --> 28:50.032
I saw a stack of these by
the mailboxes when we entered.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.425
Hey, Tan! Let's roll!

28:51.468 --> 28:52.948
This is 20-David to Command.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.297
We might've found
Charlie's next target.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.142
CHRIS:
24-David. Just got
to the repair shop.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.144
Cleared out civilians.Hold up. You see this guy?

29:20.976 --> 29:22.543
but he's holding something.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.327
Possible eyes on our suspect
at the shopping plaza

29:24.371 --> 29:26.068
on Alamo.

29:28.027 --> 29:29.463
That's Charlie.
He's got the package.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.204
25-David. Confirmed sighting
of suspect at our location.

29:49.570 --> 29:50.701
[both grunt]

29:50.745 --> 29:52.051
[clattering]

29:52.094 --> 29:53.530
Check it out.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.361
MAN:
Whoa.

29:58.405 --> 30:00.537
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Whoa.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.370
Is he back there?

30:07.414 --> 30:09.329
All right. Get out of here, man.
Get out. Go, go, go.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.418
LAPD.

30:11.461 --> 30:13.550
Hey. You need to leave now.No, my coworker
Sophie's down there.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.030
We'll get her out. Go, go, go.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.205
Stop! I got a bomb!

30:16.249 --> 30:18.033
You come one step closer,

30:18.077 --> 30:20.035
I'll open the box,
and we all get blown to hell.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.080
And the girl, too.

30:24.997 --> 30:27.086
Charlie's got himself barricaded
in the service hallway,

30:27.129 --> 30:28.565
and he's got a woman
trapped with him.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.045
He's threatening to open the box
if we come any closer.

30:30.089 --> 30:32.047
Spoke to the manager
of the shopping plaza.

30:32.091 --> 30:33.396
There's a staircase
that can get us close

30:33.440 --> 30:34.528
to where Charlie's
barricaded himself.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.051
Said we can access
it from the roof.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.748
Hey, won't he see you coming?

30:37.792 --> 30:39.446
Not if he ain't looking our way.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.230
Even if we can get down
those stairs

30:41.274 --> 30:43.754
without him noticing, he's got
eyes 15 feet in every direction.

30:43.798 --> 30:46.061
You got any idea how to diffuse
a bomb from that far?

30:46.105 --> 30:49.064
Yeah, the Disruptor Jet.
It'll shoot a bolt of water,

30:49.108 --> 30:50.500
soak the explosives
in an instant,

30:50.544 --> 30:52.502
neutralize the bomb if
I can get close enough.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.417
Hey, hey, hey.
Slow your roll, tough guy.

30:54.461 --> 30:55.592
Ain't nobody
getting close but us.

30:55.636 --> 30:57.159
Can you teach me?Yeah.

30:57.203 --> 31:00.075
It's basically a Super
Soaker on steroids.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.211
Set.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.342
Roger that.
Just made entry.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.651
TAN:
Charlie.Stop!

31:10.694 --> 31:12.435
Leave me alone.

31:12.479 --> 31:15.090
Please, just leave me alone.

31:15.134 --> 31:16.091
We're not here to hurt you.

31:16.135 --> 31:17.092
You're lying!

31:17.136 --> 31:18.615
TAN:
I promise.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.400
Okay?
I'm just here to listen.

31:34.762 --> 31:36.720
I didn't want to do this.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.679
I swear I didn't,

31:38.722 --> 31:40.159
but they wouldn't
leave me alone.

31:40.202 --> 31:41.638
They wouldn't stop staring.

31:41.682 --> 31:43.640
I told them to stop.

31:43.684 --> 31:46.687
Tan, we need him
to lower the package.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.471
Hondo needs a clear shot.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.125
I get it, Charlie.
It must be scary.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.648
I'd be scared, too.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.783
You know what I do
when I'm scared?

31:57.132 --> 31:58.786
I listen to music.

31:58.829 --> 32:01.397
Charlie, it calms
me right down.

32:01.441 --> 32:03.486
[panting]

32:03.530 --> 32:05.271
You play guitar, right?

32:06.272 --> 32:08.578
Yeah.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.319
I saw a picture of you
and Leo playing together.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.495
You looked real happy.

32:17.544 --> 32:20.416
Charlie, what would you play?

32:20.460 --> 32:23.071
Clapton.

32:23.115 --> 32:26.031
He loved... Clapton.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.510
Clapton.

32:27.554 --> 32:29.512
He's good.

32:30.905 --> 32:33.212
Which song was his favorite,
huh?

32:36.432 --> 32:38.347
[voice breaking]:
I miss him so much.

32:40.871 --> 32:43.700
[crying]

32:43.744 --> 32:47.095
I miss him so much.

32:51.926 --> 32:55.538
You lied!Stop!

32:55.582 --> 32:57.627
TAN:
On your stomach!
Give me your hands!

32:57.671 --> 32:59.716
Give me your
hands, now!

32:59.760 --> 33:01.196
[grunts]

33:05.200 --> 33:07.072
[Charlie panting]

33:08.334 --> 33:10.075
HONDO:
Lieutenant?

33:10.118 --> 33:12.555
Are you busy, or do
you have a minute?

33:12.599 --> 33:14.340
Sure thing.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.561
It's about
our conversation yesterday.

33:18.605 --> 33:20.215
Any chance you've
changed your mind?

33:20.259 --> 33:21.695
No, not even a little bit.

33:21.738 --> 33:24.219
But you asked me
if I had another solution.

33:24.263 --> 33:26.613
I think I might.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.398
Hit me.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.748
A series of recruitment meetings
throughout the county--

33:31.792 --> 33:33.576
South L.A., Inglewood,
Ladera Heights

33:33.620 --> 33:35.491
and other Black communities,

33:35.535 --> 33:38.190
hosted by Black officers,
where we can speak openly

33:38.233 --> 33:40.801
and honestly about the
challenges of being a Black cop.

33:40.844 --> 33:43.673
Lieutenant, the people who
come out to these meetings--

33:43.717 --> 33:45.806
they're taking
a big first step.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.416
They want to make
a difference,

33:47.460 --> 33:48.635
but they want to
hear us be honest

33:48.678 --> 33:50.376
about the mistakes we've made,

33:50.419 --> 33:52.508
and if we're committed
to really doing it better.

33:52.552 --> 33:55.294
And if all we do is give
them a glossy pony show,

33:55.337 --> 33:57.296
then we've lost yet
another generation

33:57.339 --> 34:00.125
of potentially good cops
because they know it ain't real.

34:00.168 --> 34:02.823
They want the truth.And what's the truth?

34:02.866 --> 34:04.651
It's tough being a Black cop.

34:04.694 --> 34:07.697
Real tough. And some days,
it feels impossible.

34:07.741 --> 34:11.484
But then, there's other days,
you win these little victories,

34:11.527 --> 34:14.704
and you actually get
to make a difference.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.576
Those little victories--
they mean something.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.843
Let me run it up the flagpole,

34:22.886 --> 34:24.714
see if I can't pull together
some funding for you.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.325
All right,
and I'll put together a list

34:26.368 --> 34:27.804
of potential venues
and officers.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.589
You'll have it first thing
in the morning.

34:32.505 --> 34:35.377
You know, Hondo?

34:35.421 --> 34:37.162
Sometimes I think
you're underutilized

34:37.205 --> 34:38.641
as just a SWAT sergeant.

34:38.685 --> 34:40.948
I'll take that as a compliment.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.255
It was meant to be.

34:43.298 --> 34:44.952
Good night.

34:49.304 --> 34:51.350
All right, bring it in.
Let's go! Bring it in.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.396
Just finished the last
run on the course.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.964
Final results are in.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.445
The 38th annual
master gunner is...

35:07.235 --> 35:09.411
Come on, Deac. Hurry it up.

35:09.455 --> 35:11.457
All right, all right.
With an official time

35:11.500 --> 35:13.981
of 49.37 seconds,

35:14.024 --> 35:16.026
Jim Street!

35:16.070 --> 35:17.550
[applause, cheering]

35:17.593 --> 35:19.291
Oh!

35:24.078 --> 35:25.645
Suck it, Stevens.

35:25.688 --> 35:26.907
Get you next year, wiseass.

35:41.269 --> 35:42.923
Hey, what's up?

35:42.966 --> 35:44.881
Hey.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.753
Hope you're not still
beating yourself up.

35:46.796 --> 35:48.885
You did good today.
With Charlie.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.757
How'd you know
he'd let go of that package?

35:50.800 --> 35:52.454
I didn't.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.587
But it's something
that worked with my dad.

35:55.979 --> 35:58.417
One time, I found him in
the kitchen holding a knife,

35:58.460 --> 36:00.332
threatening to hurt himself.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.290
Refused to put it down till
I started talking about cameras.

36:02.334 --> 36:03.552
He loved photography.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.902
I figured
if we could get Charlie

36:05.946 --> 36:07.948
thinking about
what made him feel safest,

36:07.991 --> 36:10.907
about music,
about his brother...

36:10.951 --> 36:12.605
He wouldn't think about the
bomb in his hand. That's smart.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.871
Actually, it's a...
trick I picked up from Jacob.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.655
So I guess your brother
wasn't all bad, huh?

36:21.744 --> 36:24.747
Well, me and Jacob, uh--
we were only kids.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.793
Maybe he was scared,
didn't know how to deal with it,

36:26.836 --> 36:28.751
but, uh...

36:28.795 --> 36:30.840
I don't know.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.451
I was scared, too.

36:33.756 --> 36:35.062
I never once
left my dad's side, though.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.803
Yeah, but you're
a SWAT officer.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.674
And he makes money
sitting behind a desk.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.546
You don't run
when things get dicey.

36:40.589 --> 36:41.721
Not everybody's built that way.

36:47.596 --> 36:51.078
Look, maybe it's not my place,
but before, you said

36:51.121 --> 36:53.428
that you never held your dad's
worst days against him.

36:53.472 --> 36:54.951
Well, maybe you ought to think

36:54.995 --> 36:56.649
about extending that same
benefit to your brother.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.959
Everybody can use a little
forgiveness in their lives.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.112
Jacob.

37:25.155 --> 37:27.810
Hey, it's me.

37:27.854 --> 37:30.117
It's just been a while
since we talked.

37:36.036 --> 37:37.603
Sorry it didn't work out.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.126
It's good.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.954
I'm happy for him.

37:40.997 --> 37:42.651
Chris...

37:42.695 --> 37:44.827
.18 seconds.

37:44.871 --> 37:46.829
That's it.
That was the difference.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.875
Mm.Going over it
in my head now,

37:48.918 --> 37:51.660
and-and I... I should have
beat him. Just...

37:51.704 --> 37:54.010
[sighs]
I am happy for him.

37:54.054 --> 37:55.490
But?

37:55.534 --> 37:58.188
[sighs heavily]
But...

37:58.232 --> 38:00.843
when I first met Street,
he was the guy

38:00.887 --> 38:02.889
with the crazy mom
who then got kicked out of SWAT

38:02.932 --> 38:04.586
and barely made it back.

38:04.630 --> 38:06.545
And now,
he's got it all figured out.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.417
With SWAT, with Molly.

38:09.461 --> 38:13.073
And I'm in my 30s and still
living in my uncle's garage.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.553
Feels like

38:14.596 --> 38:16.511
we swapped places somehow,
and...

38:16.555 --> 38:17.730
he left me behind.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.210
Were you two ever a thing?

38:20.254 --> 38:22.038
No. Of course not.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.692
Really? 'Cause it seems
like Street has a special way

38:23.736 --> 38:25.085
of getting under your skin.

38:25.128 --> 38:27.653
There were feelings once.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.698
Ah, called it.
Going which way?

38:29.742 --> 38:32.440
It was mutual.
We're on the same team.

38:32.484 --> 38:34.399
We shut it down.

38:34.442 --> 38:37.924
Well, look, I don't know how
to help you with him, but

38:37.967 --> 38:40.187
as far as living in your uncle's
garage, I've been looking around

38:40.230 --> 38:42.232
for a new place.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.496
Might be able to lock down
something swanky with a roommate

38:44.539 --> 38:46.106
to shares costs.I thought you were
living with your sister.

38:46.149 --> 38:48.456
Yeah. She's an EMT, she works
nights, which worked great

38:48.500 --> 38:51.459
when I was on late shift, but
now that I'm on Rocker's team,

38:51.503 --> 38:52.591
we are at each other's throats.

38:52.634 --> 38:54.767
So, what do you say?

38:54.810 --> 38:56.986
Are you kidding?
Hell yeah!

38:57.030 --> 38:58.640
All right. I'll send
over some listings.

38:59.815 --> 39:02.601
Hey, um, thanks for everything.

39:02.644 --> 39:03.950
I don't think
I would have done half as well

39:03.993 --> 39:05.995
as I did today
without your help.

39:06.039 --> 39:08.433
Any time.

39:12.132 --> 39:15.614
Last year, Lila
started gymnastics,

39:15.657 --> 39:18.878
and, uh, I went
to one of her meets,

39:18.921 --> 39:20.923
and there were these older
girls on the balance beam.

39:23.056 --> 39:26.189
It's funny. It's-it's
such a narrow beam,

39:26.233 --> 39:28.844
and they're just
launching themselves

39:28.888 --> 39:30.933
three, four feet
in the air.

39:30.977 --> 39:32.761
And for a split second,
you're not sure

39:32.805 --> 39:36.243
if they're gonna land
on it or... fall off.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.943
I mean, they may not
even know themselves.

39:43.816 --> 39:47.515
This Charlie guy,

39:47.559 --> 39:49.212
he was...

39:49.256 --> 39:52.607
he was managing, you know?

39:52.651 --> 39:56.089
And then... his brother died.

39:56.132 --> 39:58.308
Something completely
out of his control.

39:58.352 --> 40:00.136
What Charlie's
been going through

40:00.180 --> 40:01.573
and what you've gone through

40:01.616 --> 40:03.009
are completely different.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.880
No, I know. I know. It's...

40:06.621 --> 40:08.971
It's just that...

40:10.669 --> 40:13.672
Not that long ago,
I was in a really dark place.

40:17.153 --> 40:20.592
What if something comes along
and launches me off the beam,

40:20.635 --> 40:22.594
and-and I don't stick
the landing?I'd be lying

40:22.637 --> 40:25.640
if I said you're never
gonna go back to that place.

40:25.684 --> 40:28.077
But that's why
we do these sessions.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.992
If you do fall off that beam,

40:30.036 --> 40:32.168
you're gonna have the confidence
to jump right back on.

40:34.170 --> 40:36.129
Yeah, I know.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.176
I know.

40:44.224 --> 40:47.096
So what'd you decide?

40:47.140 --> 40:48.358
About Lynch's offer?Mm-hmm.

40:48.402 --> 40:50.535
Well, I was about
to take her up on it,

40:50.578 --> 40:52.580
but then she mentioned your idea
for the recruitment meetings,

40:52.624 --> 40:54.016
and I told her
I'd rather help out with that.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.671
Erika, I don't know if
it's gonna fix the problem,

40:56.715 --> 40:58.804
but I'm not ready
to throw my hands up.

40:58.847 --> 41:00.240
But if you're serious
about helping out,

41:00.283 --> 41:01.807
planning starts
tomorrow morning.

41:01.850 --> 41:03.548
Yeah, tell me when and where.Okay, good.

41:03.591 --> 41:05.550
'Cause if we don't fix
the problem, who will?

41:05.593 --> 41:07.682
At least that's what
some young fool told me.

41:07.726 --> 41:10.206
[laughs]Thank you.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.121
Thanks for waking me back up.

41:12.165 --> 41:14.776
No, Hondo. Thank you.

41:14.820 --> 41:16.909
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:16.952 --> 41:18.998
Good night.
