WEBVTT

00:34.826 --> 00:36.203
You got to sit up.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.832
So when did this start?

00:40.916 --> 00:43.377
- Just as I pulled...
- Just as you pulled through the gate?

00:44.211 --> 00:45.587
I ain't never been to jail!

00:45.671 --> 00:47.548
I don't like this!

00:47.631 --> 00:48.715
Lean your head back.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.094
You can pass out if you want to.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.555
It ain't going to make a difference,
she'll still be in jail.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.983
Turn around,
put your back on the board.

01:06.066 --> 01:06.984
Look in camera one.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.321
Oh man...

01:11.405 --> 01:14.992
When I first walked through those doors,
I was scared.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.662
<i>It seems like you're in
some third world shithole.</i>

01:20.122 --> 01:24.501
You know what you get from being in jail?
You turn cold. You turn into an animal.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.796
Please let me go home.
Please, I want to go to my son.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.258
Bitch, I'm about to get out!

01:33.260 --> 01:35.345
I've been counting down for days now.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.056
<i>Walking out of here,</i>

01:38.181 --> 01:40.183
<i>it's the best feeling in the world.</i>

01:40.267 --> 01:42.436
- Take care of yourself and do good.
- I will, baby.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.648
<i>You walk out that front door
and you don't turn back.</i>

01:47.024 --> 01:48.483
<i>You just put it behind you.</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:51.820
<i>Never thought this fucking moment
would fucking happen!</i>

01:51.903 --> 01:54.031
<i>Being incarcerated,
it changes you.</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:58.368
<i>Just have a complete 360.
Your whole view of the world changes.</i>

02:33.028 --> 02:35.656
- Alexander, you been here before?
- No, ma'am.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.991
Look straight ahead for me. Face the U.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.994
What does it say above your eye?

02:41.078 --> 02:43.121
My mom's name. LaShonda.

02:43.664 --> 02:47.793
Here's your ID until you get a wristband.
When they do a count, pull this paper out.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.503
Go around the other side

02:51.630 --> 02:52.506
To your right.

02:57.135 --> 03:00.222
Bullshit! Damn!

03:08.021 --> 03:09.398
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

03:10.023 --> 03:12.484
<i>That's my first thought.
What am I going to do?</i>

03:14.319 --> 03:18.073
<i>You know, it's not good no matter
even if it's my first offense or what.</i>

03:18.699 --> 03:21.910
Just looks really bad.
You got a car full of three black people.

03:21.993 --> 03:27.207
Two weapons, all the drugs, all the
everything. Like, it just don't look good.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.087
I was just going to get my hair done
and come home.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.841
<i>Dontrell, he picked me up to my house,
you know.</i>

03:36.299 --> 03:38.552
I was going to his house,
his wife does hair.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.929
I was just going to get my dreads
redone, or something.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.598
But he said he had to pick up
one of his friends real quick,

03:43.682 --> 03:45.976
the other guy with the small hair.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.563
I wasn't thinking nothing. Got into the
car, take me to get a money order.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.398
I live right up the street
from the store.

03:51.940 --> 03:56.862
Um, we got pulled over for my tint
on the car being too dark.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.657
When they started searching the car
thoroughly and they found a bookbag,

04:00.741 --> 04:03.785
and they just start pulling
all this... all this shit out.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.455
And they found guns and drugs
in the vehicle.

04:07.247 --> 04:11.251
And they charged everybody. I know
nothing wasn't mine. So I'm not guilty.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.586
I'm completely innocent.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.171
You've got an innocent man
sitting here.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.507
Even though I'm innocent,
it's going to be hard.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.263
Yeah, bro, listen.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.767
The only thing we got a chance
of now is going to court.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.478
I'm just letting you know
what's going on, bro.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.980
Trell, I've been here before.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.150
I already know what goes on in Gwinnett.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.067
You know what I'm saying?

04:46.828 --> 04:49.748
The Gwinnett County Jail is located
in Gwinnett County, Georgia.

04:50.916 --> 04:54.044
That's just outside the city limits
of Lawrenceville,

04:54.127 --> 04:57.214
which is approximately 30 miles north
of the city of Atlanta.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.887
The jail right here is one
of the largest in the country.

05:05.138 --> 05:09.226
The size of this facility is roughly
just under a million square feet.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.312
You could take
20 full size football fields

05:12.395 --> 05:14.564
and put them inside
the square footage of this place.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.280
This facility is classified
as a pre-trial detention center.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.158
In the course of a year,

05:25.242 --> 05:28.453
35 to 37,000 inmates
come through these doors.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.789
It's a massive operation.

05:40.382 --> 05:44.386
<i>All right, ladies, there's
going to be free time at this time.</i>

05:45.220 --> 05:47.597
<i>You have free time at this time, ladies.</i>

05:51.017 --> 05:53.270
<i>Been here 78 days.
Tomorrow will be 79.</i>

05:54.646 --> 05:56.189
<i>I've been here six times.</i>

05:57.440 --> 05:59.776
<i>I don't wanna be here no more.
That's for sure.</i>

06:00.861 --> 06:03.780
<i>It's hard, but at the same time
it actually helped me.</i>

06:03.864 --> 06:06.575
If I was out on the streets, honestly,
I'd probably be dead right now.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.460
<i>I don't have a license. Abuses of drugs
actually took them from me.</i>

06:17.544 --> 06:21.006
<i>I drove more than once
on a suspended license,</i>

06:21.089 --> 06:24.009
<i>and I'm a habitual violator
which caused me to be a felony.</i>

06:27.345 --> 06:29.556
I'm really nervous and scared to go home.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.473
Why?

06:31.892 --> 06:32.726
I don't know.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.103
I know I miss my mama.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.230
I haven't been home in so long!

06:37.314 --> 06:41.026
Well, it's new, you know?
Actually, I'm going home... this time.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.737
Not on the streets, not homeless.
I'm going home.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.946
Home. To a real home.

06:45.030 --> 06:45.947
That'll be great.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.574
Like somebody
that actually cares, you know?

06:47.657 --> 06:48.491
Yeah.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.993
Haven't had that in a long time.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.244
I'm happy for you.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.997
I'm trying to figure out
how I've lost everything.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.501
<i>My family say I chose men and drugs
over them, which is true.</i>

07:01.838 --> 07:03.590
<i>My mama's been clean for 27 years.</i>

07:03.673 --> 07:05.675
<i>I asked if I could come stay
with her when I get out.</i>

07:06.301 --> 07:07.469
<i>She said that would be great.</i>

07:07.552 --> 07:10.805
She would like to start over because
she's missed all the years in my life.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.557
And now she's trying to make up for it.

07:15.727 --> 07:19.731
I'm going to have the great experience of
being able to experience my family again.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.651
<i>And now they're actually trying
to help me...</i>

07:23.109 --> 07:26.404
<i>you know, have a normal life again,
which is going to be hard.</i>

07:26.488 --> 07:28.073
<i>It's going to be a struggle for real.</i>

07:30.450 --> 07:32.077
Struggle, Struggleville.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.372
I'm nervous. I'm scared to go home.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.376
You know, I'm scared
that I'm going to fuck up again.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.470
Mr. Russom, if you'll come out, sir.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.266
Mr. Russom, come on down.
Stand in that yellow square.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.072
Why are you messing around with this
stuff? You're too young for all this mess.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.865
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.492
- Is that what it was?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.537
I hope that that's the case.
You're too young to be in all this mess.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.998
You need to be in school,
getting you an education.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.333
Doing good for this world.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.420
- I'm going to college next month.
- Are you? Okay!

08:25.422 --> 08:27.632
All right, you've got two felony charges.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.761
Possession with intent to distribute
marijuana is one of them.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.847
The other one is possession of a gun.
What you got a gun for?

08:34.931 --> 08:37.558
- Wrong place, wrong time.
- I know, wrong place, wrong time.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.568
$11,400 is your total bond.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.322
In order to bond out, you can pay cash.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.366
That would be the entire amount.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.579
You can go through a bonding company.
Bonding companies charge 12 to 15 percent.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.665
Uh, what would be
12 to 15 percent of this?

09:04.711 --> 09:08.798
$1,710 is 15 percent.
So that's the high side.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.385
So, you're looking at about $1,700
or less at a bonding company.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.263
- Okay? Any other questions?
- Uh, no, ma'am.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.315
What they do with lil' bro?

09:25.690 --> 09:28.234
They're keeping him separated
for some reason, bro.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.988
Somebody's gonna have to
take the charge, bro,

09:32.072 --> 09:33.948
when they're charging all three of us
for the same shit!

09:35.450 --> 09:38.536
Only thing I'm thinking about right now
is my fucking kid, man.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.581
Well, my girl's tired of this shit, bro.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.291
He ain't got none of that going, do he?

09:44.626 --> 09:46.586
I got a lot to fucking lose, bro.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.465
- I'm not going down for no case.
- So what you want him to do?

09:51.049 --> 09:52.425
He gotta 'fess up.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.095
On his first fucking charge.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.305
Don't forget you're on the mic.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.766
- What?
- Don't forget you're on a mic.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.769
So? He still need to fucking 'fess up
to doing shit.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.104
Yes, he does.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.482
Whenever the fuck you see him,
you need to talk to him.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.734
- If you see him again, bro.
- You too, bro.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.861
Take your fucking charge.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.905
That's what he needs to do.
Take your charge.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.658
'Cause me being charged with distribution
ain't going to look good.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.493
Yeah, he's gotta take his charge.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.960
At the scene of a crime,
if there are multiple, uh, perps,

10:27.043 --> 10:31.506
we are very careful to keep those inmates
apart in our facility.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.885
We actually are more likely
to get to the facts of the case

10:35.969 --> 10:37.470
if we can keep them separated.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.355
Mom, I need you to bond me out.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.108
<i>- Why, what did you do?</i>
- I did nothing!

10:50.191 --> 10:53.611
He was supposed to drop me off
this morning and we got pulled over.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.904
And he had all of it on him.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.031
- Please, Mom.
<i>- How much is the bail?</i>

10:57.115 --> 10:59.784
- $1500.
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

10:59.868 --> 11:01.077
Please, Mom. I cannot...

11:01.161 --> 11:02.287
<i>I don't have money.</i>

11:02.370 --> 11:04.372
Ask... Ask Grandma.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.791
<i>Grandma doesn't have $1500 laying around!</i>

11:06.875 --> 11:09.961
Mom, I can't stay here, Mom.
I'm going to lose it, Mom.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.880
I'm... I'm... This is real jail.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.340
This is real jail
and I'm in here for a weapons charge.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.010
<i>I'll ask around, but nobody is
going to give me that much.</i>

11:17.093 --> 11:19.304
Please, Mom.
You have to get me out, Mom.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.639
I cannot stay here. I will not last, Mom.

11:21.723 --> 11:22.599
<i>Oh my God.</i>

11:22.682 --> 11:25.143
Mom, I'm going to diein here
if you don't help me.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.409
I think I've been to jail four times.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.746
This time it's going to be different.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.250
Feels like I've been locked up forever,
way more than 45 days.

11:50.084 --> 11:53.254
Woke up from my nap, I was like,
"Only got a couple of more hours!"

11:53.963 --> 11:56.716
Yeah, I'm very excited. I can't wait.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.221
My <i>oma, </i> she's here visiting from Germany.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.764
<i>Oma</i> means Grandma in German.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.059
I haven't seen her
in, like, six, seven years.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.602
So I'm so excited.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.146
It's going to be so deep. I can't wait.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.817
Your first time getting in trouble?

12:14.901 --> 12:16.319
- You got possession?
- Yeah.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.072
I've been locked up 45 days.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.408
Well, I'm here for violation of probation,
non-reporting.

12:22.992 --> 12:23.993
Petty shit.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.163
When you going home, tomorrow?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.540
In the morning, one o'clock.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.752
- So excited!
- What'll you do when you get home?

12:33.795 --> 12:36.464
- Uh, try not to get high.
- I hear you.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.175
Try to leave the methylenes alone.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.846
<i>I guess you could say I've been an addict
since I was six.</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:46.849
When I was born, my...

12:47.392 --> 12:51.938
my mom was only 15 and she wasn't
really, like, ready to be a parent.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.400
Mom would go to these parties,
make me go with her...

12:56.025 --> 12:59.279
and she would be like,
"Make me a shot! Make me a drink."

12:59.362 --> 13:01.698
I was like the bartender, and...

13:02.699 --> 13:04.617
every time I made them a drink,
I made me a drink.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.287
The first couple of times I was doing it
because I was thirsty.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.665
And then after a while,
like, I was just like...

13:11.332 --> 13:12.292
I liked the buzz.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.506
My mom didn't give a fuck 'cause
she was doing her thing, you know.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.800
Having her little parties and shit.

13:21.467 --> 13:25.722
It made me growing up kind of difficult
'cause I had to be the mom,

13:25.805 --> 13:29.058
and I really didn't get to be the...
the child.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.830
Oh...

13:51.956 --> 13:53.624
And it's all fucked up because...

13:55.543 --> 13:58.546
now I'm not here for my kids
and I bet they feel the same way.

14:19.942 --> 14:23.529
- I'm thirsty.
- Carlos Lopez?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.366
- Brown?
- Okay.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.036
Mr. Brown, come on down, sir.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.913
Do I have a bond?

14:31.996 --> 14:36.584
You've got four felony charges, all
no bond, because you're on probation.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.669
Possession of cocaine,

14:38.753 --> 14:41.756
possession with intent
to distribute marijuana,

14:42.382 --> 14:44.884
possession of a gun
during the commission of a crime,

14:45.510 --> 14:48.471
and possession of a firearm
by a convicted felon.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.309
<i>Now I can't get out of here, no bond.</i>

14:54.143 --> 14:56.020
<i>It's 'cause I'm on probation.</i>

14:56.729 --> 14:59.148
Probation is a whole other field.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.735
They can do whatever they want.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.154
Whether I'm guilty or not.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.410
Sir, you're here on two felony charges.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.205
One is manufacturing, selling,
or distributing marijuana,

15:14.288 --> 15:16.165
possession of a weapon
during a crime.

15:16.249 --> 15:20.044
Your total bond, $12,700.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.214
- I didn't have none of this stuff on me.
- That's up to a judge.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.676
<i>Charging three people for one crime.</i>

15:27.635 --> 15:33.724
<i>My plan for Slim is to get him to confess,
admit to his guilt and sign an affidavit.</i>

15:33.808 --> 15:37.812
I'm getting a lawyer once I get out and
I'm going to fight the case all the way,

15:37.937 --> 15:39.272
and I'm going to win.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.357
Where the boy at?

15:41.816 --> 15:44.152
Slim? You didn't see him in his room?

15:44.235 --> 15:45.945
He's in that last cell.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.748
The phones in the admissions area
are free.

15:57.832 --> 16:02.795
So that allows the inmates to be able to
make those phone calls and bond out.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.256
Because we encourage them
to try to bond out.

16:05.339 --> 16:10.178
We hold that inmate for up to
48 hours. If they're unable to bond out,

16:10.261 --> 16:13.764
we begin to process them
for general population.

16:13.848 --> 16:18.102
Mom, I have to get out. This is
the only night I can bail out, Mom.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.188
This is the only night
or I have to stay here.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.273
<i>You won't. You're innocent.</i>

16:22.356 --> 16:26.027
<i>You were there as just a bystander.
He was dropping you. This gun is his.</i>

16:26.110 --> 16:27.487
I can't snitch on him.

16:28.613 --> 16:33.367
I don't want that guy to hurt me. I don't
want him to come to my house or anything.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.746
Can you... can you call Grandma?

16:37.455 --> 16:39.499
<i>- I did, I just called her.</i>
- What did she say?

16:40.208 --> 16:43.920
<i>Well, she... she said
she doesn't have that money.</i>

16:46.214 --> 16:47.340
Oh, my God.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.591
Oh, my God.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.843
<i>- Alex. Alex.</i>
- What am I gonna do?

16:50.927 --> 16:54.096
- Oh, my God...
<i>- You're gonna be okay.</i>

16:54.180 --> 16:55.431
I don't know, Mom.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.433
I don't know, Mom.

17:04.565 --> 17:08.069
<i>It's just me and my mom. You know,
she's all I got. Just me and my mom.</i>

17:08.152 --> 17:09.694
<i>So we look out for each other.</i>

17:12.240 --> 17:16.243
<i>I'm from the east side of Atlanta, so...
it's not in the best area.</i>

17:16.327 --> 17:17.787
Russom, come on.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.665
<i>When you're in a neighborhood like that,
you go outside</i>

17:20.748 --> 17:23.000
<i>and see folks fighting,
shooting and all that.</i>

17:23.084 --> 17:25.252
That is just what you see.
It's what you know.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.799
I mean, when I was nine years old,
my brother was shot on my doorstep.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.094
Killed on my doorstep, and...

17:33.928 --> 17:34.845
I seen it.

17:34.929 --> 17:38.057
That's... that's what happened,
Eugene was killed.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.522
The more people that you got around you,

17:44.605 --> 17:47.567
more shit, more things can go wrong,
if you feel me?

17:47.650 --> 17:50.236
So I just... don't do that.
I just stay in the house.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.656
I just do my own thing,
but there's only so much you can do.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.996
<i>Obviously, I'm wrong place, wrong time.
That's any time.</i>

18:07.295 --> 18:09.839
Dearest Heavenly Father,
we thank you for this day, Lord.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.382
Watch our friend as she leaves here.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.884
Guide and protect her.
Send your angels to cover around her.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.262
Father, God, in Jesus' name, amen.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.305
Amen.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.850
No crying!

18:20.933 --> 18:23.436
That was beautiful.
That was beautiful.

18:25.146 --> 18:28.190
<i>These girls are amazing. They really
inspire me to really do good.</i>

18:28.649 --> 18:31.819
It's the only thing, you know,
that has kept me wanting to be here.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.697
- She said wrap it up.
- All right.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.116
It's hard. It's real, girl.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.120
Just the experience for these girls
and me leaving them. I don't want to.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.622
We'll be praying for you.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.916
<i>I brought myself to this place
and it was like it was the end.</i>

18:46.000 --> 18:50.171
- <i>I told you to pick it up.</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.799
When I first got here, I slit my wrist
from here to here on both sides.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.637
With a razor. I broke it apart,
and I cut my wrists.

18:58.596 --> 18:59.889
I bled really bad.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.725
Something triggered in my mind.
I can't do this.

19:04.435 --> 19:05.978
And now I'm ready to go back.

19:06.937 --> 19:07.897
And have it all.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.024
I'm ready for it all to come back.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.568
Especially my kids, my mother...

19:13.319 --> 19:14.278
my life.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.033
It's something that I... didn't think
was going to be hard,

19:19.116 --> 19:20.534
but it's going to be really hard.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.708
On any given day,
we release 85 to 100 inmates.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.920
The release process here starts
in the wee hours of the morning,

19:31.003 --> 19:33.172
mostly because it's easier to...

19:33.255 --> 19:35.800
get those people ready
early in the morning

19:35.883 --> 19:37.677
before we start our day,
because it gets busy.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.681
Once an inmate is ready to be released,

19:41.764 --> 19:44.016
the first process is to
collect all the belongings

19:44.100 --> 19:45.601
they've gathered while they're here.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.856
They have to make sure all the belongings
that they came in with...

19:51.399 --> 19:52.483
they're taking with them.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.406
Love you, too!

20:00.741 --> 20:02.159
<i>The officer gets them ready.</i>

20:02.660 --> 20:04.995
Now they have to be escorted
to a release area.

20:05.579 --> 20:09.125
They have to be put right back into
those temporary holding cells

20:09.208 --> 20:10.626
they started on the first day.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.341
<i>They say, like, relapse is real easy,</i>

20:17.883 --> 20:20.302
<i>like a devil's way of saying,
you know, I want you back.</i>

20:22.346 --> 20:25.266
<i>But the sponsor in the NA meetings
in jail,</i>

20:25.349 --> 20:27.727
<i>she said, I will support you
through it all when you get out.</i>

20:31.147 --> 20:34.817
My grandma, she's been back in Germany,
I think maybe 10 years.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.404
<i>But she comes back every year
or every other year.</i>

20:39.029 --> 20:43.033
<i>And right when she gets here I get locked
up so I don't never get to see her.</i>

20:44.535 --> 20:45.870
<i>She raised me.</i>

20:46.287 --> 20:49.915
<i>And she's like one of the main reasons
why I wanna go straight.</i>

20:49.999 --> 20:51.792
<i>She's... my backbone.</i>

20:54.378 --> 20:55.379
I can't wait.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.840
I just want to smell the fresh air.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.010
I can imagine it's beautiful outside.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.478
My old lady, bro.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.273
She gonna chew my ass out.
I'm like, no, I really wasn't doing shit.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.484
I was trying to catch a ride
to pay my rent.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.028
And that was it.
She know my car fucked up.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.072
Shit. I'm just living life
trying to maintain, man.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.117
- Hello.
<i>- Hello?</i>

21:25.618 --> 21:27.036
This is what I'm trying to tell you.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.831
I've got some money in my wallet.
Take that, deposit it in my bank account,

21:30.915 --> 21:33.042
and see if you can swipe me out.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.252
<i>Okay, if I cannot swipe you out...</i>

21:35.336 --> 21:36.587
Go get the money.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.172
You got me out of jail before, Shonda.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.508
Why you acting like you don't know
what the fuck you doing?

21:40.591 --> 21:42.092
<i>I'm trying to figure out if I...</i>

21:42.176 --> 21:45.471
<i>I gotta go to work... I have to go
to work this morning. Yes, I do.</i>

21:45.554 --> 21:46.514
Oh, my God.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.768
Man, I'm dead to you.
At least consider me dead to you.

21:50.893 --> 21:54.980
You actually went to work tonight, not
concerned about what the fuck is going on.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.190
And then you plan on going to work again?

21:56.273 --> 21:58.567
<i>No! Wait. Let me cut you the fuck off!</i>

21:58.651 --> 22:00.736
<i>I'm fucking doing shit
I ain't gotta fucking do!</i>

22:01.362 --> 22:03.280
The relationship I have with my girl...

22:04.031 --> 22:06.033
it ain't the best, but...

22:06.534 --> 22:10.079
I'm not faulting her for what I do
with this situation right now.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.122
I gotta depend on her because I'm in jail.

22:13.249 --> 22:16.252
My girl makes... more money than me.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.755
No, you just told me you're doing shit
that you ain't...

22:20.381 --> 22:22.716
<i>Man... listen! Stop calling me!</i>

22:22.800 --> 22:24.635
<i>I gotta fucking work
in the fucking morning</i>

22:24.718 --> 22:26.053
<i>and you fucking bothering me!</i>

22:26.136 --> 22:27.263
So I'm bothering you now?

22:27.346 --> 22:29.431
<i>I'm fucking tired. I gotta go
to fucking work in the morning.</i>

22:29.515 --> 22:30.391
<i>Good night!</i>

22:50.786 --> 22:52.663
They got a piece of paper
on the wall...

22:53.122 --> 22:55.958
saying that I need to stay away
from the other boy.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.129
He's scared of me, I guess.

23:01.046 --> 23:05.426
I ain't taking no charge for nobody
and I ain't doing no time about nobody.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.970
I'm going to tell him
to 'fess up to his shit.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.349
Don't make me pull everybody out of here.
Where is Mr. Adams?

23:13.851 --> 23:17.605
Bald-headed black guy. Adams. Is that him?
Tap him. This one right here.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.440
- Nah, that's a white dude.
- A white dude?

23:19.523 --> 23:20.399
He's a white dude.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.322
All right, everybody up!

23:26.405 --> 23:29.575
Set the phones down, set the phones down.
No, don't hang up, you'll be right back.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.660
Everybody come out,
'cause I can't find my guy.

23:32.536 --> 23:33.370
Go down.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.373
I'm looking for a person.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.334
And I can't find him.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.680
Take your fucking charge!
Take your charge, nigga.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.099
Take your charge.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.353
You're scaring him.
That's what's going on.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.731
I'll put hands on that boy.
I'll get him fucked up!

24:00.814 --> 24:02.900
I got this. Trust me, I got this.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.196
You gotta tell that man not to do
the bullshit. He gonna do the bullshit.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.823
You know that shit wasn’t his.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.368
You know that... as well as I know that.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.879
I'm like, "Oh my God,"
my heart dropped.

24:24.380 --> 24:28.008
I don't want to say something that's
going to make somebody else look bad.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.804
This is some shit that people
go away for, for life.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.656
All right, grab your bin.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.244
Right. Yep.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.580
Go and see this gentleman up there.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.457
Thank you.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.545
Ow, I'm so excited!
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

25:06.630 --> 25:08.090
<i>I'm not going to the streets.</i>

25:08.841 --> 25:11.885
<i>I'm not going to use,
I'm going to my family.</i>

25:13.804 --> 25:17.307
<i>'Cause I can't go to the streets
and stay clean. It's not going to work.</i>

25:23.772 --> 25:26.442
- Clip that tag to the top of your shirt.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.443
<i>I'm anxious.</i>

25:27.985 --> 25:30.195
<i>I guess, nervous and scared
at the same time.</i>

25:31.363 --> 25:32.197
Freedom.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.700
<i>I'm really worried
that it's not going to go well.</i>

25:42.708 --> 25:44.918
- Hey, Shantee!
- Hey!

25:46.003 --> 25:46.879
Hey!

25:47.713 --> 25:48.839
Aww...

25:52.176 --> 25:53.427
Hey, Tamaya!

25:54.136 --> 25:55.971
Aww, hey!

25:56.055 --> 25:58.390
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Fine.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.601
Pretty shoes!

26:00.684 --> 26:02.686
How you doing? You excited?

26:07.357 --> 26:10.444
- How long were you in jail?
- I was in jail 45 days.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.238
I don't think that's
long enough time there.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.783
What you mean?
How long do you want me to do, a year?

26:15.908 --> 26:17.242
Or two, or three.

26:17.326 --> 26:18.410
Good night!

26:18.994 --> 26:20.370
Why would you wish that on me?

26:20.454 --> 26:23.457
I just want this to be it.
Like, can this be it?

26:23.540 --> 26:26.460
Can this time be the last time,
like, please?

26:28.587 --> 26:29.421
It is.

26:32.633 --> 26:33.675
I hope so.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.703
I love you. It's like I lost a part of you
when you got locked up.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.208
You don't know how long
I've waited for this day.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.795
Really, you don't.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.965
I'm so glad you're out.

27:23.433 --> 27:26.270
Oh, I'm so glad to be out.
I'm so glad to go home.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.860
- Ain't that where you had a heart attack?
- Yes, ma'am.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.904
- They let me go there.
- You weren't but, what, 19, 20?

27:35.988 --> 27:36.864
Yes, ma'am.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.075
- Remember you took me to the hospital?
- I remember.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.932
<i>To accept this free call,
press one.</i>

28:04.016 --> 28:05.601
<i>Thank you for using Securus.</i>

28:05.976 --> 28:06.935
Hello?

28:07.728 --> 28:08.562
<i>Yeah?</i>

28:09.521 --> 28:11.690
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.819
Shonda, I love you,
as the mother of my child.

28:16.695 --> 28:21.366
I just need you to... I just need you
to just try to bond me out tonight.

28:21.450 --> 28:25.037
<i>Dre, I'm taking off work early
to get your ass out of jail.</i>

28:25.120 --> 28:26.997
Thank you, thank you, Shonda.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.082
Thank you, Shonda.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.001
<i>I'm fucking tired of this.</i>

28:31.084 --> 28:32.002
Thank you, Shonda.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.045
<i>I'm fucking tired of this shit.</i>

28:33.128 --> 28:34.129
Thank you, Shonda.

28:37.507 --> 28:41.803
As a brother, I worry 'bout how mine gonna
feel just 'cause we weren't on good terms.

28:41.887 --> 28:45.891
You know what I'm saying, like, yeah,
you my baby mama and all of that shit

28:45.974 --> 28:48.268
but, at the same time,
I need you to handle shit like this.

28:48.352 --> 28:51.104
Like, put all your feelings to the side,
and get this defense going.

28:51.188 --> 28:54.274
Now I got to prove I ain't no dope nigga,
you know what I'm saying?

28:58.320 --> 28:59.446
Hey, listen up.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.991
Mr. Thomas, Andre.
Thomas, Andre.

29:05.619 --> 29:08.497
Go through that door there.
Have a seat on the bench to your left.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.166
<i>Yeah, I'mma get a good lawyer.</i>

29:11.291 --> 29:13.543
<i>I'mma fight the case,
plead not guilty,</i>

29:13.627 --> 29:16.213
<i>and I'm not thinking negative.
I'm going to beat it.</i>

29:16.296 --> 29:18.674
<i>You know,
I'm going to worry about myself.</i>

29:19.341 --> 29:20.217
<i>That's all.</i>

29:24.137 --> 29:25.097
Dre!

29:26.348 --> 29:28.100
The least you could do is give me a hug.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.019
The least you could do is give me a hug.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.147
So what?

29:36.108 --> 29:36.942
Hiya.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.153
- You all right?
- No.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.530
Okay, come on.

29:42.698 --> 29:45.284
I thank you a lot for this
and I love you for this, Shonda.

29:45.367 --> 29:46.618
Okay, you're welcome.

29:47.327 --> 29:49.246
- I really appreciate it.
- Okay.

29:54.334 --> 29:57.004
- Oh, good gracious!
- Hey!

29:59.840 --> 30:00.841
I'm super fat.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.551
- Hey!
- I'm fat.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.470
Look at those thighs!

30:09.725 --> 30:12.060
- Biggie, oh my!
- You said biggie?

30:12.144 --> 30:13.103
Hell, yeah!

30:16.148 --> 30:17.733
Hey!

30:24.781 --> 30:25.866
Ohhh...

30:26.366 --> 30:27.784
I love you.

30:27.868 --> 30:28.994
I love you, too.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.331
.You look different.

30:32.748 --> 30:33.832
Like what?

30:34.082 --> 30:35.042
Different.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.880
Oma, how long has it been
since you've seen Shantee last?

30:39.963 --> 30:42.758
Last time she saw me was in jail,
I was behind the glass.

30:44.593 --> 30:48.263
It's true! Every time she comes,
Shantee is either in jail

30:48.347 --> 30:50.724
or gets locked up
before she gets to see her.

30:51.308 --> 30:52.934
- So it's been three years?
- Five.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.603
- Five.
- Five, really?

31:07.616 --> 31:09.951
Hey! I missed you!

31:10.410 --> 31:11.244
Yeah!

31:12.287 --> 31:14.581
Hey! Where's the baby?

31:16.625 --> 31:17.876
What is it, Rosie?

31:18.543 --> 31:19.878
This is my mother's home...

31:20.337 --> 31:21.421
in Barrow County.

31:21.505 --> 31:23.757
I intend to stay here
and don't intend to leave...

31:24.257 --> 31:25.634
as long as they'll accept me here.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.974
Just being clean 79 days
is a miracle.

31:33.058 --> 31:36.019
Honestly, if they tried to hand it to me,
I'd probably knock it out of their hand.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.563
Meth is no joke, but...

31:39.106 --> 31:41.066
the thought of wanting it so bad...

31:41.149 --> 31:42.692
it's just... I can taste it.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.405
It's not just in my home or my family,
it's everywhere.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.075
I'm ready to have my kids back.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.370
Determined to get them back in my life.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.005
Listen up.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.758
Do not touch anything on my cart,
do not talk to my unit workers.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.510
Grab your food and come back in this room.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.055
Appreciate it.

32:27.404 --> 32:30.490
Alex, you know, he's young,
but he knows...

32:31.533 --> 32:34.744
what I have, what I'm facing,
what I have going on.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.456
He should own up to it.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.667
He just needs a little guidance, you know.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.545
He need to know,
like, you gotta be a man about yours.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.131
Eyes on me! Hey!

32:46.506 --> 32:48.884
Pay attention, bro.
Pay attention to me, bruh.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.596
You do that, I can get you out.

32:52.679 --> 32:53.763
I can't get out.

32:54.931 --> 32:55.765
You feeling me?

32:56.433 --> 32:57.267
Right.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.896
- How much your bond is?
- $11,400.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.483
$11,400 is his bond.

33:06.610 --> 33:07.694
Have a seat on the bench.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.655
Roger Deeds!

33:12.532 --> 33:13.909
Deeds! Roger Deeds!

33:23.043 --> 33:24.211
Keep calling Kia.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.506
That’s how we’ll get in touch.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.549
Garcia!

33:30.425 --> 33:32.969
They’re gonna keep us separate.
Shit, man.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.389
Hell, you know, that's my boy.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.475
They ain't got to do all that.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.192
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

33:47.275 --> 33:48.235
Girl.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.529
We need to get Slim out.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.907
- Remember what Trap did with your shit?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

33:53.990 --> 33:55.867
That's what needs to go on right now
with Slim.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.118
That's our only way out.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.458
Trell told me to call you.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.459
<i>Hello. Yeah.</i>

34:04.543 --> 34:06.253
<i>Keep your head up and we'll try
to work everything out,</i>

34:06.336 --> 34:08.004
<i>see if we can get you out of there.</i>

34:11.424 --> 34:13.092
You talked to, um, Slim?

34:13.217 --> 34:14.928
<i>Yeah, I talked to him.</i>

34:15.344 --> 34:17.264
His bond is $11,400.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.975
That's like $1100.

34:20.433 --> 34:21.434
You feeling me?

34:24.646 --> 34:26.398
<i>- You talk to your mama?</i>
- Yeah.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.275
<i>'Cause I got to go pick up some money.</i>

34:28.358 --> 34:31.277
<i>and I can give her some or whatever
so she can put it on your bond and shit.</i>

34:31.360 --> 34:32.320
All right.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.739
<i>When you go to court, what, you gonna
take your charges and all or what?</i>

34:39.411 --> 34:40.370
Yeah, yeah.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.291
Did you talk to him about
what I asked you to talk to him about?

34:44.373 --> 34:46.585
<i>Man, he say he's gonna take his charges.</i>

34:47.002 --> 34:49.004
Repeat what you just said
one more time.

34:49.670 --> 34:53.049
<i>I said that he said
he was going to take his charges.</i>

34:58.346 --> 35:01.558
In the back of my mind, I’m thinking,
I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna bond out.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.353
Because me, sitting in jail, telling them,
"I don't got nothing to do with this.

35:05.437 --> 35:08.315
I was just... I was just there."
They hear that all day.

35:09.232 --> 35:14.195
Coming outside, you know, out of jail,
it's easier for me to plead my case,

35:14.279 --> 35:15.488
than it is in here.

35:18.908 --> 35:19.868
Mr. Russom?

35:20.535 --> 35:21.494
You're being released.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.498
<i>It was hard, to make your way
out of a situation</i>

35:25.582 --> 35:29.669
<i>where you're automatically seen as,
"Okay, he's one of the suspects too."</i>

35:30.754 --> 35:34.549
<i>Just, you know, keep my head down
and just wait till my court date.</i>

35:35.216 --> 35:36.051
Make a left.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.054
<i>It is what it is, though.
Stuff happens all the time.</i>

35:43.224 --> 35:45.894
Alex bonded out
and Andre bonded out.

35:46.853 --> 35:50.148
I'd have had a bond, too, if I wasn't
on probation. I would've been out.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.360
It's the way the law works, though.

35:54.027 --> 35:57.781
Just got to go through...
you know, the process.

36:05.914 --> 36:10.669
If you don't make bond, or if they don't
have a bond, and that 48 hours is up,

36:10.752 --> 36:12.587
now you have to be dressed in.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.090
You'll have to give up
the only possessions that you have

36:15.173 --> 36:16.383
or the clothes on your back.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.387
Go all the way down to holding cell 3.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.097
<i>You'll be given an inmate uniform.</i>

36:24.432 --> 36:27.477
- So, now you know you're in jail.
- Hands behind your back.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.650
I'm not in here forever.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.568
I'm not a murderer. I'm not a killer.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.153
Not anything like that.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.282
But I hope for the best
and I expect the worst.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.798
Ah, it feels so good to be free!

37:01.094 --> 37:02.053
Thank you!

37:02.721 --> 37:04.389
- You're welcome.
- Hot!

37:05.640 --> 37:06.891
We are...

37:07.684 --> 37:08.935
extremely tired.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.313
You're in and out and in and out.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.859
What is...? What are your plans?

37:16.568 --> 37:17.485
To go to rehab.

37:18.027 --> 37:20.405
You want to go to rehab
for sure this time?

37:20.488 --> 37:21.322
Mm-hm.

37:23.616 --> 37:24.451
It's just...

37:25.910 --> 37:27.162
...it's just awful.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.376
Is it so hard to get away from it?

37:34.043 --> 37:35.295
Is it...? What...?

37:36.045 --> 37:38.173
How strong is that feeling?

37:39.132 --> 37:39.966
To do it?

37:40.717 --> 37:42.093
Is it strong?

37:46.848 --> 37:49.225
Sometimes your body gonna shut down.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.853
Don't do this to yourself.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.565
And your children.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.361
You want her to get clean too, don't you?

38:01.780 --> 38:02.822
Tell her.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.992
That's all she talks about, is her mama.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.789
We can have a ball,
we can go cruising again.

38:10.872 --> 38:12.665
We can go to Germany, you know.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.177
Oh...

38:28.097 --> 38:29.516
Oh...

38:29.682 --> 38:32.727
You're from a strong family,
you can do this.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.482
You can do this, baby.

38:40.527 --> 38:41.986
You just gotta want to.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.197
You gotta want to do it.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.450
Okay?

38:49.744 --> 38:53.248
If you don't do it for me, do it for
yourself, do it for your children.

39:17.438 --> 39:18.356
Agh...

39:21.609 --> 39:25.780
There was a written affidavit
from Alex that was presented in court...

39:26.364 --> 39:29.409
saying that everything was his,
he claimed responsibility,

39:29.492 --> 39:31.327
and they still didn't let me go home.

39:59.564 --> 40:00.982
This is Christian Masiah.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.693
Martin, this is my 10-year old.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.323
He lives in Stone Mountain
with my brother.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.450
You're in fourth grade? Fifth?

40:10.533 --> 40:12.452
- Going to fifth.
- Going to fifth. Okay.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.537
It's new to me.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.999
<i>It's a new start for me, I know.</i>

40:18.416 --> 40:21.878
<i>The only thing I thrive for now
is the love of my family, you know.</i>

40:23.171 --> 40:24.088
Want an ice cream?

40:24.505 --> 40:25.965
- Yeah, I'll go with you!
- Yes!

40:26.507 --> 40:29.719
It's about time for an ice cream.
I ain't had one in a while.

40:49.530 --> 40:50.657
I was a superstar.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.911
I'm a good person.
I give out good energy.

40:55.578 --> 40:59.832
I should show confidence,
so good energy's going to come back to me.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.460
- That's my lucky dollar. Can...?
- Now.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.547
I hate these stupid ass fucking pigs.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.885
That fuckin' badge don't mean shit!
You don't even have a gun.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.553
You're not a real cop.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.639
Even though what I do is wrong...

41:14.722 --> 41:16.391
These people have a book.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.810
...I do it for the right reasons.
