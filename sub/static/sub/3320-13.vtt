WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:04.134
Previously onMom...

00:04.221 --> 00:06.441
Alvin and I were in love
35 years ago,

00:06.528 --> 00:09.574
and we were in love
the day he died.

00:09.661 --> 00:10.575
Are you done?

00:10.662 --> 00:12.577
Not yet.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.194
Now I'’m done.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.025
Christy, start the car.

00:27.201 --> 00:30.030
So, I'’m trying to say all
the right things to this woman,

00:30.117 --> 00:33.120
you know, be courteous,
but God as my witness,

00:33.207 --> 00:37.341
her baby was the ugliest
creature I'’ve seen in my life.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.735
I mean, they say
all babies are beautiful,

00:39.822 --> 00:42.912
but this kid could be used in
the hospital to induce vomiting.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.437
Ooh, I almost forgot.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.702
Remember how I told you

00:50.789 --> 00:52.704
your boys came through
with a big check for us?

00:52.791 --> 00:54.228
Well, we spent
the last of it yesterday

00:54.315 --> 00:55.794
paying off the credit cards.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.187
We'’re no longer poor
and in debt.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.145
We'’re just poor.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.800
Which, as you know,
is the new middle class.

01:01.887 --> 01:04.019
[laughs]

01:04.107 --> 01:06.022
Aw, this is nice.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.157
What are you looking at?

01:10.244 --> 01:12.072
Your grandmother went

01:12.159 --> 01:14.422
into Alvin'’s old apartment,
like, an hour ago.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.641
Yeah. So?
Don'’t you think
that'’s a little weird?

01:16.728 --> 01:18.339
She'’s the building manager.

01:18.426 --> 01:19.644
Maybe she'’s fixing
something in there.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.081
Have you met
your grandmother?

01:24.127 --> 01:26.042
Big Bird'’s walkin'’.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.742
Hey.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.396
Hey! Where you been?

01:32.483 --> 01:34.050
Apartment upstairs.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.312
Upstairs, you say?

01:37.314 --> 01:38.881
[clears her throat]
Which apartment?

01:38.968 --> 01:39.882
2G.

01:39.969 --> 01:40.883
Joanne Wickie?

01:40.970 --> 01:42.145
Wickie'’s 3B.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.016
Who'’s 2G?Dieter.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.018
Black body builder?Gay flight attendant.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.717
What was the problem?

01:48.804 --> 01:49.979
Door was jammed.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.068
You were up there a long time.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.418
He'’s got boyfriend trouble,
and he wanted to talk about it.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.420
What kind of trouble?

01:56.507 --> 01:57.856
You really want to know?

01:57.943 --> 01:58.988
I really do.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.383
Okay. Dieter travels a lot,

02:02.470 --> 02:04.515
and his boyfriend wants to
settle down and have kids.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.082
He even found a surrogate--

02:06.169 --> 02:07.431
a Mormon school
teacher from Fresno--

02:07.518 --> 02:09.346
but I think the
real issue is,

02:09.433 --> 02:11.261
Dieter'’s not sure what
kind of dad he'’d be

02:11.348 --> 02:12.915
'’cause he had such a
traumatic childhood.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.701
Anything else?

02:18.094 --> 02:21.750
No. That covers it.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.926
Mm.
Okay, I'’m gonna
go take a shower.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.059
Did Dieter paint your nails?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.627
And waxed my lip.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.675
Incredible.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.764
Wow.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.506
I thought I was a good liar.

02:38.593 --> 02:41.639
Oh, honey, you'’re not even
the second-best in this house.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.124
1A, 1A, 1A...

02:48.211 --> 02:50.126
Here we go.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.482
Oh, my mommy'’s broken.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.198
[sighing]: Oh...

03:18.285 --> 03:19.416
How was your shower?

03:19.503 --> 03:20.591
It was okay.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.289
I keep slipping in there.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.378
We need to put down a rubber mat
or something.

03:24.465 --> 03:27.511
Wouldn'’t be a problem if you
scrubbed more and rubbed less.

03:27.598 --> 03:31.602
Says the woman who named
the pulsating shower head.

03:31.689 --> 03:35.650
I should never have told you
about Joey.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.652
Ready to go to sleep?

03:37.739 --> 03:39.088
Mm, let'’s call it.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.657
[sighs, groans]

03:42.744 --> 03:44.833
Remember when
us sharing a bed was weird?

03:44.920 --> 03:46.051
Don'’t kid yourself.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.618
It'’s still weird.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.972
Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

03:54.059 --> 03:56.018
Sure.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.194
How you doing
with Alvin being gone?

03:58.281 --> 04:00.588
'’Cause I'’m still struggling.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.198
I'’m okay.

04:02.285 --> 04:03.982
Really?

04:04.069 --> 04:06.028
I'’m a mess.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.509
A lot of nights,
I can'’t sleep.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.424
You know what might relax you?

04:10.511 --> 04:12.426
Have a little visit with Joey.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.690
No, I think I need
to see a professional.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.692
I was thinking
that therapist

04:18.779 --> 04:20.695
at the free clinic
who helped Violet.

04:20.781 --> 04:21.913
Helped her how?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.175
She'’s mean as a snake.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.829
She has her good moments.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.483
Wow. If you'’re in
that much denial,

04:26.570 --> 04:27.963
you really do need a shrink.

04:30.139 --> 04:33.360
Hey, would you maybe be
interested in going with me?

04:33.447 --> 04:35.927
You know, for moral support?

04:36.014 --> 04:37.625
Sure, be happy to.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.844
Thanks.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.717
And while we'’re in there,
you should certainly feel free

04:42.804 --> 04:45.328
to talk about anything
that might be bothering you.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.591
I'’m good, thanks.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.201
Okay.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.203
'’Cause you know, what was...

04:51.291 --> 04:52.814
You know, being chatty in bed
might be why

04:52.901 --> 04:54.206
you can'’t hold on to a man.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.343
So, it'’s good
to see you both again.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.736
Good to see you, too.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.912
Your therapist
drinks chocolate milk?

05:05.087 --> 05:07.219
He'’s a growing boy.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.047
So what'’s been going on?

05:09.134 --> 05:10.658
Go ahead, honey.
It'’s okay.

05:10.745 --> 05:11.920
Thank you.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.661
She'’s nuts.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.097
Excuse me?

05:15.184 --> 05:16.925
I'’m sorry, but
you need help.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.754
Help with what?
I saw it.
I saw the shrine!

05:19.841 --> 05:21.756
You know about that?Why do you think
we'’re here?

05:21.843 --> 05:23.453
You said
you were struggling.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.543
I am, but not enough
to talk to this clown.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.111
So, you lied to me?

05:29.198 --> 05:30.939
If I told you the truth,
would you have come?

05:31.026 --> 05:33.550
And spend an hour
with Howdy Doody? Not a chance.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.988
Help me out here, Doc.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.991
After my father died, she got
into a fight with his widow,

05:40.078 --> 05:42.516
broke into this woman'’s
house, stole his ashes,

05:42.603 --> 05:45.780
and now she'’s built a shrine
in his empty apartment.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.912
And how does that make you feel?

05:47.999 --> 05:49.871
Forget how I feel.
Ask her how she feels.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.829
How do you feel, Bonnie?

05:51.916 --> 05:54.397
I miss the man, and it'’s very
comforting to surround myself

05:54.484 --> 05:56.094
with things
that remind me of him.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.879
That'’s nice.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.663
Nice?

05:59.750 --> 06:01.535
There'’s candles and incense

06:01.622 --> 06:03.406
and a half-used
stick of deodorant.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.103
The smell reminds me of him.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.801
I totally get it.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.456
I have one of my nana'’s
nightgowns in my closet.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.283
When did she pass?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.546
Oh, she'’s not dead.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.813
Okay, we'’re losing
the thread here.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.077
She is not dealing with
this death in a normal way.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.426
What'’s normal, Christy?

06:23.513 --> 06:24.862
Oh, for God'’s sakes.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.908
You cry, you yell at God,

06:26.995 --> 06:28.997
you do a lot of secret eating,
and then you move on.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.477
Boy, I got to tell you,

06:30.564 --> 06:32.783
"secret eating"
is a real red flag.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.481
Oh, yeah?

06:34.568 --> 06:37.309
What color flag is
Nana'’s nightgown.

06:39.877 --> 06:43.228
You see how
she lashes out?

06:44.926 --> 06:46.841
I know what you'’re doing.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.625
You two are in cahoots.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.497
It'’s okay, baby.

06:50.584 --> 06:53.021
We'’re getting you some help.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.588
I'’m gonna give you the number

06:54.675 --> 06:56.546
of someone
who can put you on medication.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.852
[shouting]:
You don'’t get it!

06:57.939 --> 06:59.680
I'’m not the crazy one!

07:01.290 --> 07:03.161
Hey, what kind
of medication?

07:09.472 --> 07:11.561
You know, I got to admit,

07:11.648 --> 07:14.042
I was pretty dubious
about that therapist,

07:14.129 --> 07:15.478
but he really
knows his stuff.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.219
Oh, please.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.482
His retainer fell out
halfway through the session.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.616
So, you think
you'’re gonna try

07:22.703 --> 07:25.575
that art therapy
he suggested?

07:25.662 --> 07:28.448
I said it before,
I'’ll say it again.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.275
I am not the one
with the problem!

07:30.362 --> 07:32.800
Shh. Draw your feelings,
don'’t shout them.

07:32.887 --> 07:33.975
I'’m not shouting.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.193
[loudly]:
This is shouting!

07:35.280 --> 07:36.456
[thudding]

07:36.543 --> 07:37.935
What the hell?!

07:38.022 --> 07:39.546
I-I think you got a flat.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.678
[sighs]

07:41.765 --> 07:43.637
Great.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.814
Way to go!

07:50.252 --> 07:51.862
Please tell me
you have a spare.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.560
Course I do.

07:53.647 --> 07:56.737
It'’s right there.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.652
Who drives around
without a spare?

07:58.739 --> 08:01.045
People who blow all their money
feeding their children.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.004
You'’re shouting again.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.530
Finally.

08:07.617 --> 08:08.575
Wow!

08:08.662 --> 08:09.837
What?

08:09.924 --> 08:11.621
The tow truck driver.

08:11.708 --> 08:12.927
What about him?

08:13.014 --> 08:14.406
Don'’t you see it?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.060
He looks just
like your father.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.673
Oh, Mom, is this like
when you took peyote

08:19.760 --> 08:21.979
and saw Jesus
in a tortilla?

08:22.066 --> 08:23.764
Are you the folks
with the flat?

08:23.851 --> 08:25.679
Yup.
You got a spare?

08:25.766 --> 08:28.333
Hey look, I have a growing child
who needs to eat,

08:28.420 --> 08:30.466
so everybody
just back off.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.990
Don'’t mind her.
She'’s in therapy.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.948
I need to see a
membership card.

08:35.035 --> 08:36.732
Hang on.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.953
Hi. Bonnie.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.215
Hello.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.739
And you are... Bill.

08:42.826 --> 08:45.046
Yes, ma'’am.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.264
Call me "Bonnie."

08:46.351 --> 08:48.440
Call me "Bill."

08:48.528 --> 08:52.270
I sure will, Bill.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.924
Does it have
to be valid?

08:54.011 --> 08:56.579
Yup.
Mm, let me look
in the glove compartment.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.237
So how long you been
driving a tow truck?

09:02.324 --> 09:04.456
Tonight, or in general?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.807
[laughs]

09:06.894 --> 09:09.636
Is there a Mrs. Tow Truck?

09:09.723 --> 09:11.855
Not yet.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.728
Here you go.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.207
All right. Be right back.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.166
Hurry.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.950
What are you doing?

09:20.037 --> 09:23.127
Did you not see the
crazy chemistry we had?

09:23.214 --> 09:25.695
I saw the crazy.

09:25.782 --> 09:28.176
Christy, we didn'’t just
break down by accident.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.178
I was meant to
meet that man.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.396
Okay, that'’s it.

09:31.483 --> 09:32.789
Soon as the tire'’s changed,

09:32.876 --> 09:34.530
we are driving back
to the therapist,

09:34.617 --> 09:37.141
and you are gonna tell him
about the tow truck driver

09:37.228 --> 09:38.708
you'’re convinced
is my dead father.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.405
I never said he was
your dead father.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.190
Well, that'’s reassuring.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.409
But with a little work,
he could be.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.768
You know, I'’ve been
thinking about it, and

09:54.855 --> 09:57.422
I decided that it'’s a good thing
that you'’re going on this date.

09:57.509 --> 09:58.685
What changed your mind?

09:58.772 --> 10:00.382
Who am I to say that this

10:00.469 --> 10:02.123
tow truck driver
isn'’t right for you?

10:02.210 --> 10:04.038
I mean, what do I know?

10:04.125 --> 10:06.083
I'’m in an exclusive relationship
with a shower head.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.783
[muttering]:
Not that exclusive.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.352
When you think about it,

10:14.439 --> 10:16.528
it'’s actually kind of
a meet-cute.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.269
We get a flat tire, and...

10:18.356 --> 10:20.141
you meet the man

10:20.228 --> 10:23.100
who looks like the man
who died between your legs.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.407
I'’m glad you feel that way.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.148
Yeah, me too.

10:27.235 --> 10:28.976
Except I don'’t.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.849
This is how I feel!

10:32.936 --> 10:36.070
That is so going
on the refrigerator.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.902
Hello.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.947
Hi, Bill. Come on in.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.906
Whoa.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.431
Fancy place.

10:49.518 --> 10:52.086
You'’re kidding, right?

10:52.173 --> 10:53.217
Why would I kid about something
like that?

10:53.304 --> 10:55.176
Look at all these windows.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.965
I should tell you that my
mom doesn'’t drink alcohol.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.750
Okay.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.795
I got a bag of oranges
in the truck.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.058
I suppose I could give her that.

11:08.145 --> 11:11.235
What gal doesn'’t want
a bag of oranges?

11:13.237 --> 11:16.458
I should also tell you that,
uh, she just lost my dad.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.416
Well, that'’s too bad.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.810
Yeah, it is. But, um,
here'’s what you need to know:

11:20.897 --> 11:23.813
She'’s still pretty
raw about it.

11:23.900 --> 11:28.209
Hmm. So I got a grieving woman
who doesn'’t drink.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.776
Yeah.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.212
Well, looks like
my sense of humor'’s

11:31.299 --> 11:33.083
gonna come in handy.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.261
Hello, Bill.

11:37.348 --> 11:38.262
Hello.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.788
Oh, the hooch ain'’t for you.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.138
All right.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.226
Ready to go?

11:45.313 --> 11:46.923
You bet.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.969
Good night, dear.

11:50.971 --> 11:53.625
So a guy'’s in bed
with a one-legged hooker...

11:53.713 --> 11:55.627
Wait, she'’s
got one eye.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.891
And the thing is
she'’s keeping an...

11:59.501 --> 12:01.808
Your usual, Bill?Thank you, honey.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.027
Mm-hmm. Know what you want?

12:04.114 --> 12:05.725
Might need a minute.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.988
FYI, people come here
for our chicken wings.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.859
Yeah, I don'’t think that'’s why.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.428
Tell you what, just give me
the cheeseburger salad.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.430
Oh, a health nut.

12:17.475 --> 12:20.174
I take it you'’re a regular here.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.045
Well, the food'’s nothing
to write home about,

12:22.132 --> 12:23.699
but every girl that works here,

12:23.786 --> 12:26.833
they have the big boobies.

12:26.920 --> 12:31.402
Well, your bumper sticker
does say, "I honk for honkers."

12:33.448 --> 12:36.930
So, your daughter says
your husband recently passed.

12:37.017 --> 12:39.671
We actually weren'’t married,
but, yes.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.064
Well, condolences.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.587
Thank you.

12:42.674 --> 12:45.025
Was it a car crash?
Maybe I towed him.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.159
Sorry. Heart attack.

12:49.246 --> 12:52.772
Aw. Sad either way.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.948
You ever think about letting
the hair around the sides

12:55.035 --> 12:56.253
grow out a little?

12:56.340 --> 12:58.168
Would you like that?I would.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.562
I'’m growing it now.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.043
Great.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.001
You know what else
would look good on you,

13:05.088 --> 13:06.829
a-a leather jacket.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.049
Ooh, I'’ll buy one tomorrow.
Brown?

13:09.136 --> 13:10.615
Black.
Oh, and you like jazz now.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.356
Hmm.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.228
Sort of sounds like
you'’re trying to turn me

13:14.315 --> 13:15.533
into some other guy.

13:15.620 --> 13:16.926
You have a problem with that?

13:17.013 --> 13:18.275
Well, it depends.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.625
This "other guy..."

13:20.712 --> 13:22.758
would you sleep with him?

13:28.851 --> 13:29.765
Hey.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.027
Hey.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.507
What you doing?

13:32.594 --> 13:34.596
Mm... paying bills.

13:34.683 --> 13:37.686
I'’m embarrassed to tell you how
much we owe the water company.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.780
I think I'’m gonna have
to break up with Joey.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.783
Want an orange?

13:50.394 --> 13:52.309
No, thank you.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.920
How'’d it go?

13:54.007 --> 13:55.008
So far, so good.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.052
We'’re taking it slow.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.880
Well, that'’s a relief.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.360
I don'’t want
to rush into anything.

13:59.447 --> 14:00.840
Very smart.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.145
When are you gonna
see him again?

14:02.232 --> 14:03.407
Tomorrow. I'’m helping him move

14:03.494 --> 14:05.061
into Alvin'’s old apartment.

14:05.148 --> 14:06.976
What?

14:07.063 --> 14:09.196
Well, someone'’s got to rent it.
And as I told Bill,

14:09.283 --> 14:11.024
there comes a time
in every man'’s life

14:11.111 --> 14:13.330
when he needs to move out
of his mother'’s house.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.637
Oh, my God, that'’s so pathetic.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.334
He lives with his mother?

14:17.421 --> 14:19.380
You live with yours.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.208
This isn'’t about me.

14:21.295 --> 14:23.863
This is about you not dealing
with Alvin'’s death,

14:23.950 --> 14:26.430
and I can'’t believe
you don'’t see it!

14:26.517 --> 14:29.912
And yes... this is
pathetic as well!

14:34.482 --> 14:36.571
Let'’s talk about the tongue.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.660
You'’re not trying
to lick an envelope.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.314
Yeah.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.055
It'’s more like a dance.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.144
Okay, let me try it again.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.450
Mm... a slow dance.

14:48.496 --> 14:51.412
Hey, how come you'’re not wearing
the cologne I got you?

14:51.499 --> 14:53.718
I didn'’t like it.Well, it'’s not for you.
It'’s for me.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.372
Well, why don'’t you wear it?

14:55.459 --> 14:57.679
Okay, I think we'’re
done for tonight.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.681
Aw, fudge!

15:00.769 --> 15:02.031
Don'’t get discouraged.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.424
You'’re doing great.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.816
You'’re just saying that.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.296
Bup-bup-bup.
Don'’t do the sad puppy.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.602
Nobody sleeps
with the sad puppy.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.734
Sorry.And don'’t apologize.

15:09.821 --> 15:12.433
It'’s okay, every once
in a while, for you
just to tell me off.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.696
All right. I'’ve had it
with you bossing me around!

15:14.783 --> 15:16.567
Not now!Sorry.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.091
I'’ll see you tomorrow.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.048
Oh...

15:20.702 --> 15:23.792
Oh, God. I made him sign
a two-year lease?

15:25.141 --> 15:27.796
Well, maybe he'’ll die, too.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.758
This is
a very upsetting picture.

15:33.845 --> 15:38.981
It'’s a way for Mommy to express
what'’s inside of her.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.636
[knocking on door]BONNIE:
I'’ll get it.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.986
This is inside of you?

15:46.206 --> 15:48.208
It'’s Bill.
Tell him I'’m not here.

15:48.295 --> 15:49.426
What? Why?

15:49.513 --> 15:50.950
I made a mistake.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.777
He'’s not the guy
I thought he was.

15:52.864 --> 15:53.953
[knocking on door]

15:54.040 --> 15:55.041
You think maybe because the guy

15:55.128 --> 15:56.172
you thought he was is dead?

15:56.259 --> 15:57.957
Hey, that is totally unc...

15:58.044 --> 15:59.523
You know what,
maybe you'’re right.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.443
ROSCOE:
Thank you.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.755
Oh. Hey, Bill.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.278
Lookin'’ good.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.888
I know.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.542
Is your mom home?

16:18.629 --> 16:20.980
No, she is not.Isn'’t that her coat?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.851
Oh, um, no.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.287
That'’s mine.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.636
Really? I'’m pretty sure

16:25.723 --> 16:27.638
she was wearing it
the other night.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.901
No, no, no. No.
This is, uh...

16:37.083 --> 16:38.736
Looks a little big.

16:38.823 --> 16:41.696
This is how they wear them
in Europe.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.698
Bonjour.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.398
Can I give her a message?

16:48.485 --> 16:50.139
Yeah, just tell her
I need to talk.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.446
You got it.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.058
[sighs wearily]

16:56.145 --> 16:57.581
The things that I do...

17:02.064 --> 17:03.326
Thanks.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.546
You'’re welcome.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.852
What happened to you?You'’re what happened to me.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.506
What did he want?

17:09.593 --> 17:12.031
I don'’t know.
He wanted to talk to you.

17:12.117 --> 17:13.771
Oh, God!

17:13.858 --> 17:16.078
I have a feeling
he'’s gonna ask me to marry him.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.166
Why would you think that?

17:18.253 --> 17:21.040
Come on.

17:21.127 --> 17:24.521
Sure. What monkey doesn'’t want
to climb that tree?

17:24.608 --> 17:26.435
So what'’s the plan?

17:26.522 --> 17:28.308
I don'’t know.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.092
Before I got sober,
it'’d be easy to get rid of him.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.747
Just plant some drugs in his car
and make a phone call.

17:32.834 --> 17:36.011
But now I have a conscience.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.318
That'’s what you call it, right?

17:38.405 --> 17:40.276
I guess.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.671
[sighs]
I must'’ve
been crazy

17:43.758 --> 17:45.368
to drag him into my life.

17:45.455 --> 17:48.023
Aha! You finally admit it.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.590
Okay.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.853
I miss Alvin
more than I can bear.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.768
You happy?

17:53.855 --> 17:55.813
No.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.252
But it'’d be nice if you
told the therapist.

17:59.339 --> 18:00.905
I'’m not the one
with the problem.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.821
Wow. You are desperate
for approval.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.783
I guess I better go
cut Bill loose.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.741
Guess you better.

18:10.828 --> 18:14.093
How would you feel
about comin'’ with me?

18:26.627 --> 18:28.846
That'’s what I thought.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.600
Oh. Hey, Bonnie.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.124
Glad you stopped by.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.604
Well, stick a pin in "glad."
We need to talk.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.389
WOMAN:
Who'’s at the door, baby?

18:49.476 --> 18:51.869
It'’s my ex-girlfriend.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.089
Hi, Cheeseburger Salad.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.569
You gotta be kidding me.

18:55.656 --> 18:56.657
Yeah, I tried
to tell you earlier,

18:56.744 --> 18:58.267
but you were avoiding me.

18:58.354 --> 18:59.616
Well, I didn'’t want
to break your heart.

18:59.703 --> 19:00.922
That'’s ironical.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.882
I'’m sorry, Bonnie.
I just...

19:04.969 --> 19:07.755
I couldn'’t be the guy
you wanted me to be.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.626
You know what, Bill?

19:09.713 --> 19:11.237
Nobody could.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.195
On the bright side,
thanks to you sprucing me up,

19:13.282 --> 19:15.023
Selene here finally took notice.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.634
I love the leather jacket.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.159
Terrific.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.856
She'’s also the nice lady
that taught me how to kiss.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.945
Oh, did you also teach him...No, no, no, no.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.425
Just kissing.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.603
Okay, well, I hope
you'’ll be very happy.

19:29.690 --> 19:30.865
How can I not be?

19:30.952 --> 19:34.216
Look at these boobies.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.959
All right,
I-I'’m gonna go now.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.613
Hey, Bonnie?

19:39.700 --> 19:40.831
Are we good?

19:40.918 --> 19:41.832
Yeah, of course we'’re good.

19:45.053 --> 19:48.361
Screw it.
I'’m putting drugs in his car.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.283
How'’d it go?

19:57.370 --> 19:58.327
How do you think?

19:58.414 --> 20:00.851
He was devastated.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.679
Oh. Sorry.
Yeah.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.291
[sighs, sputters]

20:05.378 --> 20:07.597
Good thing he has that hot chick
to comfort him.

20:07.684 --> 20:08.685
[yells]

20:14.430 --> 20:16.867
I forgot to tell you: I ran
into Bill'’s new lady friend

20:16.954 --> 20:18.347
in the laundry room
the other day.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.088
Oh, yeah? What'’d you think?

20:20.175 --> 20:23.831
She made me feel
like a boy.

20:23.918 --> 20:27.008
That'’s nothing.
She made me feel like a lesbian.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.925
But you'’re doing okay
though, right?

20:31.012 --> 20:33.710
I'’m fine. Just got to learn
to process my grief over Alvin

20:33.797 --> 20:36.191
and move on.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.584
Good for you.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.063
This seat taken?

20:43.154 --> 20:45.069
