WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.047
- Previously on The Originals...
- When the spell is over,

00:02.049 --> 00:03.399
you got to get away from each other,

00:03.401 --> 00:05.031
and you have to stay away from Hope.

00:05.034 --> 00:06.726
We got water turned into blood.

00:06.729 --> 00:08.630
We got snakes fleeing the river.

00:08.632 --> 00:10.312
If the Mikaelsons come together,

00:10.315 --> 00:12.716
it will signal darkness
like we've never known.

00:12.719 --> 00:14.364
Now, if there's anybody who can cause

00:14.367 --> 00:15.503
the collapse of New Orleans,

00:15.505 --> 00:18.496
- it's Klaus Mikaelson.
- This isn't about Klaus at all.

00:18.499 --> 00:19.661
It's about his daughter.

00:19.664 --> 00:21.409
Hope Mikaelson will be our downfall.

00:21.411 --> 00:23.311
Oh, my God. Henry.

00:24.614 --> 00:26.081
I'm not going anywhere with you.

00:26.083 --> 00:28.216
We are your family.

00:28.218 --> 00:30.293
I don't care about any of you.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.676
Elijah Mikaelson is dead.

00:35.759 --> 00:37.292
I may need your help waking her up.

00:37.294 --> 00:38.940
Hope was boasting
about a cloaking spell,

00:38.943 --> 00:40.075
a sleeping spell.

00:40.078 --> 00:41.129
Hayley?

00:42.632 --> 00:44.766
Where is she?

00:44.768 --> 00:46.234
Oh, my God.

00:46.236 --> 00:48.303
I'll find your mother, and I swear...

00:48.305 --> 00:49.738
I'll return her to you.

00:56.346 --> 00:59.580
New Orleans is a survivor.

01:00.984 --> 01:03.418
She's faced down countless tragedies:

01:03.420 --> 01:06.087
fires, floods, war.

01:06.089 --> 01:09.724
Where another city would buckle,

01:09.726 --> 01:12.927
New Orleans turns misery into magic.

01:12.929 --> 01:15.203
And each year,

01:15.206 --> 01:17.656
the greatest tradition of all endures...

01:20.236 --> 01:22.270
Mardi Gras.

01:22.272 --> 01:24.703
In spite of all our differences,

01:24.706 --> 01:27.406
the whole city celebrates
Carnival season together.

01:27.409 --> 01:30.144
- David, I like this fabric.
- You like it?

01:30.146 --> 01:31.679
I think it's good, too.

01:31.681 --> 01:33.239
There are more than 80 groups

01:33.242 --> 01:34.615
that join the party in the weeks

01:34.617 --> 01:36.684
leading up to Fat Tuesday,

01:36.686 --> 01:41.789
each krewe more unique than the last.

01:41.791 --> 01:44.525
There's something for everyone.

01:44.527 --> 01:48.729
Looking for love or
hungry for a good time?

01:48.731 --> 01:50.865
There's no better mistress

01:50.867 --> 01:52.778
than New Orleans during Mardi Gras,

01:52.781 --> 01:56.187
as long as you can stand the heat.

01:57.373 --> 01:59.240
So, what exactly are you implying?

01:59.242 --> 02:00.908
Hope hid her mother
with a cloaking spell.

02:00.910 --> 02:03.023
Someone found her.
That requires a witch.

02:03.026 --> 02:05.045
So that means it was one of mine?

02:05.048 --> 02:06.881
I don't think so.

02:06.883 --> 02:09.413
You witches always plead virtue,

02:09.417 --> 02:10.728
but if history's to be prologue,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.126
you're the most rotten of the bunch.

02:12.128 --> 02:14.129
As soon as Freya told me
that Hayley had gone missing,

02:14.131 --> 02:16.524
there were a dozen of us
witches out there on them streets

02:16.526 --> 02:18.593
performing locator
spells, trying to find her.

02:18.595 --> 02:20.828
Because Hayley is actually
a friend to us, okay?

02:20.830 --> 02:22.431
Hayley, unlike you,

02:22.434 --> 02:23.959
has earned our respect.

02:23.962 --> 02:25.099
And out of respect to her,

02:25.101 --> 02:27.201
I'm only gonna say this
to you one time, Klaus:

02:27.203 --> 02:29.137
we had absolutely nothing to do

02:29.139 --> 02:30.972
with her disappearance.
I promise you that.

02:30.974 --> 02:33.841
A witch's promise is
as slippery as snake oil

02:33.843 --> 02:35.143
and as effective.

02:35.145 --> 02:37.111
You want peace and prosperity?

02:37.113 --> 02:39.814
Prove your innocence and find her.

02:39.816 --> 02:41.751
Why would the werewolves

02:41.754 --> 02:43.086
take down their own Alpha?

02:43.089 --> 02:44.651
That's a valid question. Perhaps one

02:44.654 --> 02:46.587
of your fellow swampmates
can shed some light.

02:46.589 --> 02:49.079
We are the victims here.

02:49.082 --> 02:50.825
A bloodsucker killed Henry

02:50.828 --> 02:51.973
just for being a hybrid.

02:51.976 --> 02:53.801
No, you wolves saw the boy

02:53.804 --> 02:55.337
as an abomination, as well.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.833
Who's to say the same disgust
didn't extend to Hayley?

02:58.835 --> 03:02.370
A guilty wolf could just
point fingers at vampires

03:02.372 --> 03:03.738
to cover their tracks.

03:05.542 --> 03:08.742
If you didn't take her, I
suggest you find out who did.

03:08.745 --> 03:11.447
Do you really think my
guys would be that stupid?

03:11.450 --> 03:14.348
They know that if they even
laid a finger on Hayley,

03:14.350 --> 03:15.731
they'd be answering to me.

03:15.734 --> 03:17.450
Well, was it you who
ordered the vampires

03:17.453 --> 03:19.086
to antagonize the wolves and string up

03:19.088 --> 03:21.856
that hybrid boy? No.

03:21.858 --> 03:23.858
I didn't think so.
Perhaps your royal status

03:23.860 --> 03:26.043
has wilted along with
your marital prospects.

03:26.046 --> 03:27.293
All right, all right.

03:27.296 --> 03:29.329
Easy. The vampires

03:29.332 --> 03:32.582
like Hayley... everyone
does. We didn't touch her.

03:32.585 --> 03:34.841
Well, I suggest you amp up your
efforts to retrieve her, then.

03:34.843 --> 03:36.801
Because if my daughter is not reunited

03:36.804 --> 03:38.105
with her mother by sundown,

03:38.107 --> 03:39.809
then your entire faction will face

03:39.812 --> 03:41.264
the wrath of my disappointment.

03:41.267 --> 03:43.043
Close proximity of just two Mikaelsons

03:43.046 --> 03:44.245
turned rain to blood.

03:44.247 --> 03:45.829
Imagine what would happen

03:45.832 --> 03:47.993
if I were to turn to
my siblings for help.

03:47.996 --> 03:49.549
Our little family reunion

03:49.552 --> 03:52.322
would cause hellfire to devour us all.

03:52.325 --> 03:56.845

04:02.398 --> 04:05.233
Compelling NOLA's finest, I see.

04:05.235 --> 04:06.743
If that's the city's finest,

04:06.746 --> 04:08.703
then it will wither
from its own mediocrity.

04:08.705 --> 04:12.001
Now, what are humans gonna do
that the other factions can't?

04:12.004 --> 04:14.650
They have the numbers.
I need eyes everywhere.

04:14.653 --> 04:16.820
Whoever did this can't hide from me.

04:19.082 --> 04:21.616
- What?
- Mm.

04:21.618 --> 04:23.618
Clear eyes, focused demeanor.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.275
You know, for Klaus Mikaelson,

04:25.278 --> 04:26.886
I'd say you're acting pretty normal.

04:26.889 --> 04:29.690
If you've got a point,
Marcel, spit it out.

04:29.692 --> 04:31.392
There's chatter you're unhinged.

04:31.394 --> 04:32.994
I'm just making sure you're not poised

04:32.996 --> 04:34.686
to do something that we'll all regret.

04:34.689 --> 04:36.290
Well, if the suicidal simpletons

04:36.293 --> 04:38.227
who took my daughter's
mother return her unharmed,

04:38.229 --> 04:41.002
I won't have to do something
we'll all regret, will I?

04:41.004 --> 04:44.138
What happened when you went
to go visit Elijah in France?

04:44.140 --> 04:47.108
Nothing. He wasn't there.

04:47.110 --> 04:49.048
No? You two didn't come face-to-face?

04:49.051 --> 04:50.217
Because last I heard,

04:50.220 --> 04:51.142
Hope's picking maggots

04:51.145 --> 04:52.407
out of her cafeteria food.

04:52.410 --> 04:54.147
You seem to forget
that my other siblings

04:54.150 --> 04:55.316
carry this curse.

04:55.318 --> 04:57.285
So this is because Kol and Rebekah

04:57.287 --> 04:58.853
had an impromptu reunion?

04:58.856 --> 05:01.688
Well, she's certainly
not with you, is she?

05:01.691 --> 05:03.423
This city isn't gonna stand

05:03.426 --> 05:05.292
for the kind of retribution
you're threatening,

05:05.295 --> 05:06.460
and neither am I.

05:06.462 --> 05:08.162
Well, then, I suggest

05:08.164 --> 05:11.132
you take all of this as an incentive.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.564 --> 05:31.686
Your brother has got a
very interesting approach

05:31.688 --> 05:33.150
to motivational speaking.

05:33.153 --> 05:35.455
Look, I know there's
no love between you two,

05:35.458 --> 05:39.115
but as insane as he seems,
Klaus's tactics always work.

05:39.118 --> 05:41.415
Just ride out his bad
mood as best as you can.

05:41.418 --> 05:42.565
Yeah, if he keeps messing with me,

05:42.567 --> 05:43.772
I'm gonna show him a bad mood.

05:43.775 --> 05:45.166
Tell me, did you make contact?

05:45.168 --> 05:46.801
"Make contact"?

05:46.803 --> 05:49.295
We talking about my
niece or a secret agent?

05:49.298 --> 05:50.404
Freya.

05:50.406 --> 05:52.025
I know that this is
hard for you to hear,

05:52.028 --> 05:53.827
but Ivy's cards
predicted that your niece

05:53.830 --> 05:55.497
might, in fact, be
the devil in disguise,

05:55.500 --> 05:56.966
so you cannot be soft on her.

05:56.969 --> 05:58.368
She's 15.

05:58.371 --> 06:00.438
Her future isn't written in stone.

06:00.441 --> 06:01.816
That's why I'm here.

06:01.818 --> 06:03.384
To make sure of it.

06:03.386 --> 06:05.386
Good luck.

06:05.388 --> 06:07.088
You, too.

06:17.233 --> 06:19.689
W-What happened?

06:19.692 --> 06:21.202
Uh, oh, no, nothing.

06:21.204 --> 06:22.903
Uh, no, your...

06:22.905 --> 06:25.506
your father has search parties
scouring every inch of the city.

06:25.508 --> 06:27.174
We'll find her.

06:27.176 --> 06:29.343
I just...

06:29.345 --> 06:33.240
When I saw you, I
thought that she... yeah.

06:33.243 --> 06:35.249
So, wait, if she's still missing,

06:35.251 --> 06:36.684
then why are you here?

06:36.686 --> 06:39.387
Care package.

06:39.389 --> 06:41.389
Thought you could use a taste of home.

06:41.391 --> 06:45.868
So you drove all this
way to bring me beignets?

06:45.871 --> 06:48.128
You know, I figured
with everything going on,

06:48.131 --> 06:49.615
you could use a friend.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.867
- Thanks, but I'm really fine.
- Mm-hmm.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.792
You know, I could be wrong, but, um,

06:55.795 --> 06:58.806
I think this is the part
where you invite me in.

06:58.808 --> 07:02.076
Yeah. Yeah.

07:03.913 --> 07:05.913
Yeah.

07:14.223 --> 07:16.725
Locator spells in 12 ancient languages?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.352
Thought you weren't allowed to do magic

07:18.355 --> 07:19.756
outside of the classroom.

07:19.759 --> 07:21.084
Catch-up reading.

07:21.087 --> 07:23.289
I'm trying to make up
for being suspended.

07:23.292 --> 07:25.659
- Mm-hmm.
- Keep my grades up.

07:31.540 --> 07:33.840
I got to get back to work, Aunt Freya.

07:33.843 --> 07:37.678
Sure. Sure, I mean, I could just leave

07:37.680 --> 07:41.382
after an excruciating 11-hour drive

07:41.384 --> 07:43.284
to see my only niece.

07:43.286 --> 07:45.519
Or...

07:45.521 --> 07:47.521
we could get comfy,

07:47.523 --> 07:50.658
stuff our faces with deep-fried glory,

07:50.660 --> 07:53.093
and you could tell
me about that cute boy

07:53.095 --> 07:55.584
you had hidden in your room last week.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.502
Have you considered
this might be a trap?

08:02.505 --> 08:06.006
I could have 30 vampires
here in five minutes.

08:06.008 --> 08:08.476
I can't help you if you won't let me.

08:08.478 --> 08:10.611
If your assistance requires
psychological evaluation,

08:10.613 --> 08:12.022
allow me to make this easy for you:

08:12.025 --> 08:14.247
psychopath on a mission,
no time for chitchat.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.617
Look, you want to shed blood today?

08:15.619 --> 08:17.214
Get in line. I care about Hayley, too.

08:17.217 --> 08:19.545
So be a dick to everyone else,
but watch your tone with me.

08:20.556 --> 08:22.790
We're here.

08:26.575 --> 08:28.529
Wait.

08:28.531 --> 08:32.366
What do you hear?

08:32.368 --> 08:34.400
- Absolutely nothing.
- Hmm.

08:46.456 --> 08:48.326
Klaus.

09:05.368 --> 09:08.035
Wolfsbane and vervain.

09:08.037 --> 09:10.568
She was here.

09:11.162 --> 09:12.576
_

09:27.590 --> 09:29.868
So, which one is he?

09:29.871 --> 09:32.671
The hot one that sweats diamond dust.

09:34.242 --> 09:35.875
All right, all right.

09:35.877 --> 09:38.544
Uh-huh.

09:38.546 --> 09:40.079
Hey! Hey!

09:40.081 --> 09:41.743
Go, go, go, go, go!

09:44.018 --> 09:45.845
Yeah!

09:54.087 --> 09:55.394
Oh, God.

09:55.396 --> 09:56.517
Keep-keep walking.

09:57.899 --> 10:00.733
Wait, you're not gonna wave back?

10:00.735 --> 10:02.959
No, pretty sure, uh,
his ego can handle it.

10:06.598 --> 10:08.307
Hey, so...

10:08.309 --> 10:10.876
that stuff you were studying earlier.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.412
Alchemy of the Iberian Peninsula?

10:13.414 --> 10:16.782
Magic of the Middle East?

10:16.784 --> 10:18.454
I'm examining

10:18.457 --> 10:20.223
regional magic as it relates

10:20.226 --> 10:24.255
to sociopolitical and economic statuses.

10:24.258 --> 10:28.194
So, what exactly are the
sociopolitical implications

10:28.196 --> 10:30.629
of breaking powerful cloaking spells?

10:33.434 --> 10:35.201
What do you want me to say?

10:35.203 --> 10:36.769
My mom's missing.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.728
Trying to break every possible spell

10:39.731 --> 10:43.441
in those books by yourself
would take a thousand years.

10:43.444 --> 10:46.979
This is exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

10:46.981 --> 10:48.353
And guess what?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.682
You and the witches
haven't gotten anywhere.

10:50.685 --> 10:52.651
I'm coming at it from a different angle.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.887
Okay.

10:54.889 --> 10:56.368
I'm the one that

10:56.371 --> 10:58.423
put the cloaking spell
on her in the first place.

10:58.426 --> 11:00.959
Maybe I can find a way to lift it

11:00.962 --> 11:03.362
without being in the room with her.

11:03.364 --> 11:06.132
And the fact that that's never been done

11:06.134 --> 11:09.564
in the history of witchcraft
isn't going to deter you.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.767
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.103
All right, then.

11:19.347 --> 11:20.970
Let's get to work.

11:23.251 --> 11:25.251
Why does Marcel have us wasting time

11:25.253 --> 11:27.019
trudging through the bayou?

11:27.021 --> 11:28.368
Well, you know, technically,

11:28.371 --> 11:30.905
you can't waste time if you're immortal.

11:30.916 --> 11:33.000
You know what I mean, Josh.

11:34.295 --> 11:36.095
This is how we honor Poppy's memory?

11:36.097 --> 11:39.751
Okay, look, Marcel wants
Klaus out of town ASAP.

11:39.754 --> 11:41.866
Finding Hayley makes that happen.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.314
Just trust me, okay?

11:44.317 --> 11:46.751
Klaus gone is good for everyone.

11:46.754 --> 11:48.286
Fair enough.

11:48.289 --> 11:50.475
But what about when
what's good for everyone

11:50.478 --> 11:52.711
isn't good for vampires?

11:55.864 --> 11:57.964
I'll head down to the water.

12:01.642 --> 12:02.922
Joshua.

12:02.924 --> 12:05.157
And here I thought we were friends.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.960
Okay, okay, fine. You
caught me bad-mouthing you.

12:08.963 --> 12:12.236
But I was bad-mouthing while
also doing what you asked,

12:12.239 --> 12:15.673
so I'm thinking they kind
of cancel each other out, no?

12:24.177 --> 12:27.745
Oh, wow, a hostage situation.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.114
How creative.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.540
You might call it that.

12:30.543 --> 12:32.985
I call it gentle encouragement.

12:32.987 --> 12:35.721
Now,

12:35.723 --> 12:39.811
lovely Colette, be a dear,
and enclose your new roommate

12:39.814 --> 12:40.845
in a barrier spell.

12:40.848 --> 12:43.515
I would so hate for
anyone to steal you away.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.780
I won't do magic for you.

12:49.753 --> 12:53.204
Josh, tell her how this goes.

12:54.809 --> 12:57.697
Actually, allow me to speak for you.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.800
If you don't do as I
say, I will hunt down

12:59.803 --> 13:02.280
anyone you love, and then blood, gore,

13:02.283 --> 13:05.918
screaming, death... I win.

13:07.932 --> 13:09.332
Did I do it justice?

13:28.442 --> 13:31.477
Referte mini quid sa yo mi te wé.

13:31.554 --> 13:35.681
Referte mini quid sa yo mi te wé.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.211
Referte mini quid sa yo mi te wé.

13:38.319 --> 13:41.570
Referte mini quid sa yo mi te wé.

13:41.648 --> 13:44.590
Referte mini quid sa yo mi te wé.

13:44.592 --> 13:46.058
Hayley has definitely been in here.

13:46.060 --> 13:50.062
I can't sense who took her, but, um,

13:50.064 --> 13:52.851
fear is just dripping off the walls.

13:55.820 --> 13:57.429
Are you 100% sure

13:57.432 --> 13:59.071
no one in your ranks did this?

13:59.073 --> 14:01.206
I'm 100% sure, are you?

14:01.208 --> 14:04.109
Seven years ago, I
would've said absolutely,

14:04.111 --> 14:08.272
but now, I seem to be getting
more attitude than allegiance.

14:08.275 --> 14:10.809
I'm gonna tell you something, Marcel.

14:10.812 --> 14:12.711
I appreciated this city
a hell of a lot more

14:12.714 --> 14:15.286
when it ran like a democracy
and not like a monarchy.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.247
Truth be told, none
of y'all were missed.

14:19.128 --> 14:20.304
He took Colette.

14:20.307 --> 14:21.807
- What?
- Klaus.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.430
He took a member of each faction.

14:24.432 --> 14:25.922
Colette, David...

14:25.925 --> 14:27.320
Who's one of Lisina's wolves...

14:27.323 --> 14:29.501
That vampire who runs Rousseau's...

14:29.504 --> 14:30.837
Josh?

14:31.757 --> 14:34.173
He said if we don't turn
Hayley in by sundown,

14:34.175 --> 14:35.908
he'll slaughter them.

14:44.741 --> 14:46.412
It's over and over again.

14:46.415 --> 14:49.065
Over and over, it's
the exact same story.

14:49.068 --> 14:51.245
I give that family the
benefit of the doubt,

14:51.248 --> 14:53.303
I do magic for them...

14:53.305 --> 14:56.076
and then in the end,
it's just the same thing.

14:56.079 --> 14:57.541
And the only thing that I know right now

14:57.543 --> 14:59.256
is that I got to get Colette back.

14:59.259 --> 15:01.211
You're letting rage drown reason.

15:01.213 --> 15:03.146
Look, I get it.

15:03.148 --> 15:05.112
Witches do the spells,

15:05.115 --> 15:07.009
protect the land, keep the peace,

15:07.012 --> 15:08.745
but who looks out for us, right?

15:08.748 --> 15:11.003
We all know how the story goes.

15:11.006 --> 15:13.159
But that doesn't mean
we can risk their lives.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.597
If we attempt a rescue,
Klaus will kill them all.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.683
You know that.

15:16.686 --> 15:19.362
That's the thing: I don't know that.

15:19.365 --> 15:21.198
I have absolutely no way of predicting

15:21.200 --> 15:23.400
what that man is going to do.

15:23.402 --> 15:25.102
When it comes to war,

15:25.104 --> 15:26.904
there is absolutely no strategist

15:26.906 --> 15:28.739
that is as great as Klaus Mikaelson,

15:28.741 --> 15:30.340
but he needs his brother
as his co-captain.

15:30.342 --> 15:32.576
He's got to have Elijah
there to rein him in.

15:34.413 --> 15:36.480
I got to get Colette back.

15:36.482 --> 15:40.317
Then let's ask the
cards for guidance, huh?

15:40.319 --> 15:44.554
If Klaus steps out of line,
we'll be the first to know.

15:56.584 --> 15:58.154
Let him out.

15:59.805 --> 16:01.272
- Now.
- I'm afraid Josh

16:01.275 --> 16:03.272
is far more useful in here.

16:03.275 --> 16:04.970
Is that what I'm supposed
to tell my guys? Huh?

16:04.972 --> 16:06.473
They already think I'm toeing your line.

16:06.475 --> 16:08.712
Your "guys," Marcel.

16:08.714 --> 16:10.448
The words scrawled on
the wall of that house

16:10.451 --> 16:12.441
apply to you just as much as they do me.

16:12.444 --> 16:14.718
Freak. Crossbreed.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.214
Perhaps that's why the vampires
are deaf to your demands,

16:17.217 --> 16:20.261
or are you still pretending
to be one of them?

16:20.264 --> 16:22.527
Those words also apply

16:22.530 --> 16:23.727
to your daughter, or did
you forget about that?

16:23.729 --> 16:25.864
All of this...

16:25.867 --> 16:27.901
is for my daughter.

16:30.747 --> 16:33.402
They took Hayley by force.

16:33.405 --> 16:36.166
They tied her down like an animal,

16:36.169 --> 16:37.522
because she's different,

16:37.525 --> 16:40.378
because they were scared of
her. See, that's their language.

16:40.381 --> 16:42.446
Fear.

16:42.448 --> 16:43.914
Now they'll listen.

16:43.916 --> 16:45.980
Josh, I will get you out of here.

16:45.983 --> 16:46.928
All right? I promise.

16:46.931 --> 16:48.818
How sentimental. Do your job

16:48.821 --> 16:50.620
and deliver my next message.

16:59.431 --> 17:01.365
Pretty.

17:02.468 --> 17:04.534
In a creepy,

17:04.536 --> 17:07.246
"don't get caught alone
here at night" kind of way.

17:07.249 --> 17:10.050
The Saltzman twins found
it, like, two years ago.

17:10.053 --> 17:12.705
Pretty sure it's their
evil Mean Girl lair.

17:12.709 --> 17:16.099
Or they share their
father's love for the bottle.

17:17.316 --> 17:19.049
All right.

17:19.050 --> 17:20.384
You want to find your mom,

17:20.386 --> 17:22.219
I got to start with

17:22.221 --> 17:24.791
how she was taken in the first place.

17:24.795 --> 17:27.269
I already told you, I don't know.

17:27.271 --> 17:28.859
Someone followed me.

17:31.208 --> 17:34.808
Or there was a problem
with your cloaking spell.

17:34.811 --> 17:37.567
Maybe you missed a step...

17:37.569 --> 17:38.802
left a loophole open.

17:38.804 --> 17:41.204
No, of course I didn't.

17:41.206 --> 17:42.603
Fine.

17:42.606 --> 17:43.839
You were followed.

17:43.842 --> 17:46.245
Then we retrace every step you took.

17:46.248 --> 17:49.076
A deconstructing spell will
magnify that the cup of blood

17:49.079 --> 17:51.114
in each bowl will give us that.

17:51.116 --> 17:53.842
I know how it works, Aunt Freya.

18:11.737 --> 18:12.936
Don't stop.

18:15.307 --> 18:16.606
Dammit.

18:16.608 --> 18:18.208
It wasn't enough.

18:18.210 --> 18:21.115
It's healing faster than I'm bleeding.

18:21.118 --> 18:22.857
Maybe you shouldn't have picked a spell

18:22.860 --> 18:24.526
that involved me bleeding out.

18:30.722 --> 18:34.224
Which you knew couldn't happen.

18:34.226 --> 18:36.487
You don't want to do this spell.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.861
Not particularly, no.

18:37.863 --> 18:39.963
Why? Because it isn't going to work.

18:41.166 --> 18:42.959
If there was even a
chance of it working,

18:42.962 --> 18:45.761
don't you think one
of the hundred powerful

18:45.764 --> 18:47.956
New Orleans witches would
have thought of it by now?

18:47.959 --> 18:51.100
Then why are we wasting time?

18:51.103 --> 18:53.737
There's something you're not telling me.

18:56.841 --> 19:00.290
Vincent and Ivy think
they've learned something.

19:02.221 --> 19:04.421
About you.

19:09.311 --> 19:11.528
Good-bye letters?

19:11.530 --> 19:14.014
- The hell is Klaus trying to prove?
- Look, I don't

19:14.017 --> 19:15.932
like his methods any more
than you do, all right?

19:15.934 --> 19:18.301
But let's not lose
sight of the goal here.

19:18.303 --> 19:20.089
To get Hayley back home safely.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.059
Why do we care about Hayley?

19:22.062 --> 19:23.761
She's not one of us.

19:23.764 --> 19:26.261
I'm sorry, "us"? Look,
I've only seen your face

19:26.264 --> 19:28.097
three times in my
entire life, all right?

19:28.100 --> 19:30.581
So let's not start throwing
stones about who's who.

19:30.584 --> 19:32.482
You might not know me,

19:32.484 --> 19:35.285
but I know you.

19:35.287 --> 19:37.687
You're a self-made legend.

19:37.689 --> 19:39.977
Marcel Gerard,

19:39.980 --> 19:43.448
the vampire with werewolf
toxin in his fangs.

19:43.451 --> 19:46.394
But perhaps your loyalties

19:46.397 --> 19:49.250
aren't what they used to be.

19:49.253 --> 19:51.253
Fangs that will shut you up

19:51.256 --> 19:54.089
permanently in less than six seconds

19:54.092 --> 19:55.971
if you don't fall in line.

19:55.974 --> 19:58.441
It all started when that hybrid

19:58.443 --> 20:00.217
killed an innocent vampire.

20:00.220 --> 20:02.377
And how did the vampires respond?

20:02.380 --> 20:03.646
By murdering him.

20:03.648 --> 20:04.819
He was a threat.

20:04.822 --> 20:06.822
He was a kid!

20:06.825 --> 20:08.458
What will it take

20:08.461 --> 20:10.995
to get you two to understand, huh?

20:12.390 --> 20:14.272
If Josh dies because of you two,

20:14.275 --> 20:16.275
I will bury you both with him.

20:19.698 --> 20:21.998
Now get out there and find her!

20:33.646 --> 20:37.915
I used to hear all kinds of wild
tales about Vincent Griffith.

20:37.917 --> 20:40.551
I could never figure out what
was fact and what was fiction.

20:40.553 --> 20:43.387
Well, what did you hear?

20:44.693 --> 20:47.660
Strong man full of fire.

20:49.295 --> 20:50.861
A good friend.

20:50.863 --> 20:53.463
Vicious enemy.

20:53.465 --> 20:56.200
A great husband.

20:56.202 --> 20:57.801
Whose wife lost her way.

20:59.877 --> 21:02.011
That's before my time. I don't judge.

21:02.014 --> 21:03.640
I do.

21:03.780 --> 21:06.476
I do.

21:06.478 --> 21:09.079
Long and short of that is

21:09.081 --> 21:10.681
I got us both into some dark magic.

21:10.683 --> 21:13.217
I got out of it, she did not.

21:18.057 --> 21:20.757
I took my ex-husband to a burlesque club

21:20.759 --> 21:22.826
on our fifth anniversary.

21:22.828 --> 21:26.396
Should I blame myself because he
left me for one of the dancers?

21:26.398 --> 21:27.928
Well, how'd you get over that?

21:27.931 --> 21:30.378
What, the humiliation? The rage?

21:30.381 --> 21:32.035
The grief.

21:34.373 --> 21:36.906
I tell my friends he was a fool

21:36.909 --> 21:39.943
and I'm a strong woman
who deserves better.

21:39.945 --> 21:41.877
But in truth,

21:41.880 --> 21:44.548
I read up on vengeance spells.

21:44.551 --> 21:46.784
I cried every night for a year.

21:46.787 --> 21:50.153
And then I took up yoga so
I could feel beautiful again.

21:50.155 --> 21:51.811
Huh.

21:53.842 --> 21:55.826
Oh, man.

21:55.828 --> 21:57.160
What?

21:57.162 --> 21:59.092
The idea that you would spend so much

21:59.095 --> 22:01.564
as a single second feeling

22:01.567 --> 22:05.269
like you're anything other than...

22:05.271 --> 22:07.615
beautiful...

22:10.897 --> 22:12.709
This...

22:12.711 --> 22:15.112
is fleeting.

22:15.114 --> 22:18.348
This needed some self-care.

22:18.350 --> 22:20.784
So I let go of my rage,
I said some prayers,

22:20.786 --> 22:22.787
and now here we are.

22:24.089 --> 22:25.889
Shall we?

22:44.006 --> 22:45.809
Now.

22:45.811 --> 22:48.111
Turn them over.

22:53.701 --> 22:55.519
Battle.

22:59.358 --> 23:01.525
Cunning.

23:04.730 --> 23:05.862
Loss.

23:07.932 --> 23:10.733
Klaus is grieving, desperate, but...

23:10.736 --> 23:13.804
he's not erratic. He
knows if he pushes us,

23:13.806 --> 23:15.350
we'll revolt.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.152
Hayley will be lost.

23:17.155 --> 23:20.977
But Klaus is playing a
larger game here. He's...

23:20.979 --> 23:22.879
walking a fine line.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.783
But he's on the right side of it.

23:26.785 --> 23:28.639
For now.

23:36.525 --> 23:38.792
I sent your hotline squad
back to the precinct,

23:38.795 --> 23:39.930
where they belong.

23:39.932 --> 23:41.465
They won't remember a thing.

23:42.484 --> 23:44.150
They were useful,

23:44.153 --> 23:45.953
unlike the rest of you.

23:45.956 --> 23:47.722
They were your playthings.

23:47.725 --> 23:50.140
And I think you have enough
of those in your dungeon.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.477
Your good-bye letters
didn't do any good.

23:53.479 --> 23:56.446
And now, instead of searching,
the vampires and the werewolves

23:56.448 --> 23:58.936
are back in their corners, paranoid.

23:58.939 --> 24:00.516
It was your motivational speaking

24:00.519 --> 24:02.097
that failed, not my letters.

24:02.100 --> 24:04.788
Hey, look, I don't know what
happened between you and Elijah.

24:04.790 --> 24:07.424
And if he were here, he would
know exactly what to say,

24:07.426 --> 24:09.292
but he's not. I am.

24:09.294 --> 24:11.995
And I'm saying you misplayed this.

24:11.997 --> 24:13.997
Let the prisoners go.

24:13.999 --> 24:17.176
You think I should be weak,

24:17.179 --> 24:19.713
just give in to my enemy.

24:19.716 --> 24:23.519
If keeping Hayley alive
makes you weak, yes.

24:23.522 --> 24:25.336
Don't presume to lecture me.

24:25.339 --> 24:28.712
For centuries, I have bent
the will of countless fools

24:28.714 --> 24:31.110
to do my bidding because they feared me.

24:31.113 --> 24:33.417
I know how to protect this family.

24:33.419 --> 24:35.619
This is my family. For
the last seven years,

24:35.621 --> 24:38.282
I have been a phone call
away whenever Hope needed me.

24:38.285 --> 24:39.823
I am trying

24:39.825 --> 24:42.659
to talk you out of making the
biggest mistake of your life.

24:42.661 --> 24:44.561
To protect you from yourself.

24:44.563 --> 24:45.969
So you don't have to tell Hope that

24:45.972 --> 24:47.369
you're the reason that
her mother is dead.

24:47.371 --> 24:49.232
He knew!

24:49.234 --> 24:51.701
Okay?

24:51.703 --> 24:54.504
Elijah knew who he was, and
he still told me to leave.

24:54.506 --> 24:55.705
I begged him.

24:57.110 --> 24:59.456
He didn't want anything
to do with any of us.

25:03.582 --> 25:05.615
He's gone, Marcellus.

25:05.617 --> 25:07.191
He's gone.

25:09.623 --> 25:11.610
I understand.

25:11.613 --> 25:14.414
I do. Look, I understand the pain.

25:14.417 --> 25:17.494
But you got to move through it, okay?

25:17.496 --> 25:19.362
You can't let it cloud your judgment.

25:19.364 --> 25:21.565
Not with Hayley's life on the line.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.053
_

25:44.056 --> 25:46.441
What's in the box?

25:54.633 --> 25:56.582
They mutilated her.

25:59.428 --> 26:01.194
Something's changed.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.607
The death card.

26:03.609 --> 26:05.175
Oh, God, no.

26:07.712 --> 26:09.178
Klaus, wait.

26:09.181 --> 26:11.538
They're goading you. And they will pay.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.742
If you kill those hostages,
then what do you think...

26:18.771 --> 26:20.854
Klaus, I am telling you right now,

26:20.857 --> 26:22.323
I am the only friend you've got.

26:22.326 --> 26:25.161
Marcel, please, I'm
going out of my mind here.

26:25.163 --> 26:27.998
Look at what they've done to Hayley.

26:28.001 --> 26:30.868
I don't do well without Elijah.

26:35.474 --> 26:37.040
Just let me help.

26:42.881 --> 26:45.148
If I break the barrier spell,
we can get out here and...

26:45.150 --> 26:47.266
And then he can make a game
out of hunting his prey.

26:47.269 --> 26:48.518
Not interested.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.754
I bet the three of us
could get a jump on him.

26:50.756 --> 26:53.423
Said the guy whose last
words will be "Oops."

26:54.626 --> 26:56.893
I'm sorry, I can't just
sit here and wait to die.

27:15.013 --> 27:16.246
Klaus,

27:16.248 --> 27:17.761
don't do this.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.853
I warned you, Klaus.

27:24.856 --> 27:27.207
All the good people
that you've feasted on,

27:27.210 --> 27:29.858
all that innocent blood
that you've spilled,

27:29.861 --> 27:31.795
it's time you gave that back.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.372
Are you okay?

27:57.951 --> 28:00.118
Where the hell were you?

28:01.580 --> 28:03.647
You said you'd stop him.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.582
Look, I didn't want any of this.

28:05.584 --> 28:07.984
What you wanted w-was
to slide back into town

28:07.986 --> 28:10.454
a-and run things like you used to.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.656
And while you were out
there stomping around,

28:12.658 --> 28:15.246
alienating everyone, I had your back.

28:19.496 --> 28:21.398
And now look.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.652
Josh.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.310
Well,

28:33.312 --> 28:36.213
I have a witch to bury.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.351
You can take care of that mess.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.039
So I'm, like, cursed?

28:52.042 --> 28:54.984
Predicted to be the
downfall of what, my family?

28:54.987 --> 28:56.453
New Orleans?

28:56.456 --> 28:58.289
The world?

28:58.292 --> 29:00.237
I...

29:00.239 --> 29:03.273
I have no idea.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.476
But you deserve to know what's going on.

29:06.478 --> 29:10.133
And we both need to prepare
for the possibility that...

29:10.136 --> 29:12.816
things might not work out
the way we want them to.

29:12.818 --> 29:15.418
You mean for my mom to die?

29:17.022 --> 29:20.657
For what happens inside of you

29:20.660 --> 29:22.692
any time tragedy strikes.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.664
For when your emotions
are tested in ways

29:27.667 --> 29:29.432
you couldn't even imagine.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.363
How can anyone prepare for that?

29:34.139 --> 29:37.908
You aren't just anyone, Hope.

29:37.910 --> 29:41.878
You're a firstborn
Mikaelson witch with...

29:41.880 --> 29:44.381
a terrifying amount of power,

29:44.383 --> 29:46.446
even without the darkness

29:46.449 --> 29:48.752
that your family is
keeping you away from.

29:48.754 --> 29:51.094
So, what? I'm so sensitive,

29:51.097 --> 29:53.423
everyone's afraid I'm
just gonna flip out?

29:53.425 --> 29:57.149
Well, when people like
you and me flip out,

29:57.152 --> 29:59.963
entire villages can burn.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.606
Look...

30:09.608 --> 30:13.310
I know what it's like
to have your family

30:13.312 --> 30:15.258
thrust you into a situation

30:15.261 --> 30:18.782
where the world is on
your shoulders and...

30:18.785 --> 30:22.019
you're not at all sure if you
have the strength to carry it.

30:23.652 --> 30:25.855
And how's that working for you?

30:27.394 --> 30:29.559
Not well.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.529
It's why I'm not with the woman I love.

30:34.082 --> 30:37.750
So then why don't you just... go back

30:37.753 --> 30:41.771
and deal with that and leave
me to go try and find my mother.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.407
Hope, stop.

30:43.410 --> 30:45.118
Why? So you can keep stalling me?

30:45.121 --> 30:47.177
You can't shut down, or
it'll eat you up inside.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.612
- Leave me alone.
- Hope...

30:48.614 --> 30:51.314
I said leave me alone!

30:52.617 --> 30:54.183
Hope!

30:54.186 --> 30:55.542
Stop it!

31:00.519 --> 31:02.933
Are you ready to talk now?

31:17.708 --> 31:19.942
You're a fool.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.845
Why?

31:21.847 --> 31:24.814
Because I fell for your
sob story about Elijah?

31:24.816 --> 31:26.616
That even true?

31:26.618 --> 31:28.585
Every word of it.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.954
Even at our most estranged,
there was always a trace

31:30.956 --> 31:34.691
of the brother I loved, but not anymore.

31:34.693 --> 31:38.561
Every part of him was unfamiliar.

31:40.866 --> 31:44.401
I promised Hope I'd bring
her mother home safely.

31:44.403 --> 31:47.488
And instead, you turned
the city upside down.

31:47.491 --> 31:49.538
That was always the plan.

31:49.541 --> 31:52.597
Put the pressure on and
see how the factions react.

31:54.846 --> 31:56.977
Vincent and the witches worked with us.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.368
The wolves were prepared
to die for their Alpha,

31:59.371 --> 32:00.950
but the vampires...

32:03.050 --> 32:05.121
They did nothing but resist.

32:05.123 --> 32:07.090
They were always
threatened by the freaks

32:07.092 --> 32:09.092
and the crossbreeds like us.

32:11.558 --> 32:13.797
A vampire took Hayley,

32:13.799 --> 32:16.700
so that those who care
for her would suffer.

32:19.152 --> 32:21.504
They're keeping her alive for now.

32:21.506 --> 32:24.074
This is a game, and they're enjoying it.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.196
Yeah, and you're playing
right into that game.

32:26.199 --> 32:28.178
You may have gotten the
answers that you needed,

32:28.180 --> 32:29.579
but you didn't get Hayley back,

32:29.581 --> 32:31.881
and now you've alienated an entire city.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.550
Why would you do that?

32:33.568 --> 32:37.636
I can't save her if they don't fear me.

32:40.027 --> 32:42.092
And neither can you.

32:50.225 --> 32:54.193
The king has spoken,
and we all come running.

32:54.196 --> 32:56.897
Yeah, well, he said he
had news about Klaus.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.900
Personally, I'd like a
front row seat for this one.

33:07.627 --> 33:09.268
All right.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.956
Now, I know that most of you feel

33:12.958 --> 33:15.992
that I have been mistaken in
some of my decisions lately.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.895
You feel that I've
been living in the past,

33:18.897 --> 33:20.363
in the days when I was king,

33:20.365 --> 33:22.465
calling the shots, and my word was law.

33:22.475 --> 33:26.277
And I have to admit... you're right.

33:27.550 --> 33:29.372
I wanted to rule through trust,

33:29.374 --> 33:31.852
and through goodwill and consent.

33:31.855 --> 33:33.977
But as I said, I made a mistake.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.147
I lost control of you,

33:37.149 --> 33:39.149
but...

33:39.158 --> 33:41.191
no more.

33:42.893 --> 33:45.988
Until I can trust all
of you to fall in line,

33:45.991 --> 33:49.235
and until Hayley Marshall is
found, I am changing the rules.

33:49.238 --> 33:51.027
First,

33:51.029 --> 33:52.896
I'm restricting your movements.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.414
No more daylight rings.

33:54.417 --> 33:56.733
You have no right to do that.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.301
You're not one of us anymore.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.507
That's right.

34:04.509 --> 34:06.509
We're not.

34:06.518 --> 34:09.820
What we are... is in charge.

34:12.971 --> 34:14.817
Break the rules, defy our orders,

34:14.820 --> 34:17.687
no more head garden. Just your head.

34:21.092 --> 34:23.065
Any questions?

34:37.743 --> 34:39.768
Is it just me, or is this room

34:39.772 --> 34:42.005
starting to get a reputation?

34:44.350 --> 34:48.252
Henry jumped, and you
look like you might.

34:51.362 --> 34:53.623
I had kind of a day.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.760
Your mom?

34:58.088 --> 35:00.154
No sign of her.

35:00.157 --> 35:02.865
And according to my aunt,

35:02.868 --> 35:05.816
all of the witches in New Orleans think

35:05.819 --> 35:09.320
that I'm gonna melt the city
if she doesn't come home.

35:09.323 --> 35:12.391
You can do that?

35:13.613 --> 35:15.946
Probably.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.148
I don't know.

35:18.150 --> 35:23.153
I think I'm just tired of
everyone being so scared of me.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.489
That's understandable.

35:30.162 --> 35:33.227
Now's the part that you're
supposed to say that you're not.

35:34.608 --> 35:37.276
Oh, I'm terrified.

35:37.279 --> 35:39.612
But I'm kind of a risk-taker.

35:48.833 --> 35:50.466
That's my cue.

35:59.392 --> 36:03.060
A private audience with
the boy who sweats diamonds.

36:03.062 --> 36:04.667
Nice.

36:06.966 --> 36:11.035
I'm sorry... for exploding like that.

36:11.037 --> 36:14.438
No. You shouldn't be.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.696
Look, you didn't ask for any of this.

36:16.699 --> 36:18.876
You didn't start it.

36:18.878 --> 36:21.312
But I'm the end of it.

36:21.314 --> 36:24.114
Right? One way or another?

36:30.523 --> 36:32.457
So what do we do now?

37:27.269 --> 37:30.279
Our krewe has been
part of Carnival season

37:30.282 --> 37:32.649
since this city's earliest days.

37:32.651 --> 37:37.821
Through every tragedy, we uphold
the tradition of celebration.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.324
Tonight, we parade in Colette's honor.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.626
We will lead her down our streets,

37:42.628 --> 37:45.529
and we will remember
what we all stand for.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.564
The spirit.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.566
The earth.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.602
This city.

37:51.604 --> 37:53.404
Together as one.

37:53.406 --> 37:56.207
Together as one!

37:56.308 --> 37:58.509
Together as one!

37:58.511 --> 38:02.050
Together as one! Together as one!

38:02.181 --> 38:05.149
Together as one! Together as one!

38:05.238 --> 38:08.863
Together as one! Together as one!

38:42.788 --> 38:46.256
War has been declared on our people.

38:46.258 --> 38:48.324
First, the vampires kill a boy

38:48.327 --> 38:50.621
at the beginning of his journey.

38:50.624 --> 38:54.264
And then someone abducts our Alpha.

38:54.266 --> 38:57.234
And now our fate is in the
hands of Klaus Mikaelson,

38:57.236 --> 39:01.438
a madman who denies his
roots to our community,

39:01.440 --> 39:03.847
killing an irreplaceable friend.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.380
We are on our own.

39:10.383 --> 39:13.952
And we need to be ready to fight.

39:43.282 --> 39:45.849
I knew you weren't gonna
stay down for too long.

39:46.919 --> 39:48.952
What do you want?

39:48.954 --> 39:52.383
You can take your time
commemorating your dead,

39:52.386 --> 39:55.649
but when you're done,
Marcel and I need your help.

39:55.652 --> 39:57.172
We know that it was a vampire

39:57.175 --> 39:58.795
who took Hayley, and with your magic...

39:58.797 --> 40:00.292
You must be out of your mind, Klaus.

40:00.295 --> 40:02.629
I'm not doing any magic for you.

40:02.632 --> 40:04.566
Matter of fact, I
must be out of my mind,

40:04.569 --> 40:06.621
because I thought you had it in you.

40:06.624 --> 40:08.576
I really thought that
you had the potential

40:08.579 --> 40:09.940
to be a better man.

40:12.912 --> 40:14.378
But after this?

40:18.450 --> 40:20.394
No, sir.

40:20.397 --> 40:23.152
The witches are done
being on call for you.

40:23.155 --> 40:24.922
All you know how to do is use and abuse.

40:24.925 --> 40:27.156
You treat us like we're pawns.

40:27.159 --> 40:28.402
Like we're pawns

40:28.405 --> 40:31.753
in your family's endless
self-defeating schemes.

40:33.886 --> 40:35.958
No more.

40:35.961 --> 40:37.795
But congratulations.

40:37.798 --> 40:40.899
You made it back to the
top of the food chain.

40:40.902 --> 40:43.307
But let me tell you something.

40:43.309 --> 40:46.143
If you come after my witches
again, it is going to be a war,

40:46.145 --> 40:48.211
and I don't mean a war
between you and the covens.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.980
I mean a war between you and me.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.777
And I hope you get that.

40:56.021 --> 40:58.292
Yeah.

41:11.474 --> 41:12.940
Where's Vincent?

41:12.943 --> 41:15.110
- We're on our own.
- None of this makes sense.

41:15.113 --> 41:17.707
What could Hayley have
done to deserve this?

41:27.486 --> 41:29.496
What is that?

41:29.499 --> 41:33.022
A message...

41:33.025 --> 41:36.277
from enemies I thought
I buried long, long ago.
