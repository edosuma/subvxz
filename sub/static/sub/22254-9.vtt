WEBVTT

00:09.610 --> 00:11.862
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.

00:11.863 --> 00:13.697
I can do whatever I want.

00:13.698 --> 00:17.493
I'm president of the goddamn
United States of America.

00:17.494 --> 00:19.119
Isn't that right, Checkers?

00:19.120 --> 00:21.473
That's what it says
on your business cards.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.376
There are going to be riots
in the streets.

00:25.377 --> 00:26.793
I'm Secretariat.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.004
You think I'm afraid
of a few rioting hippies?

00:29.005 --> 00:31.941
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

00:31.966 --> 00:34.051
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

00:34.052 --> 00:35.886
Please, I'll do anything.

00:35.887 --> 00:38.055
You gotta send someone else
in my place.

00:38.056 --> 00:44.078
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...
arranged.

00:46.147 --> 00:50.942
I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.
My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.

00:50.943 --> 00:53.070
He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam,

00:53.071 --> 00:56.073
which is necessary
to protect our way of life.

00:56.074 --> 00:59.284
And another hero is President Nixon.

00:59.285 --> 01:02.722
He is one groovy dude.

01:04.290 --> 01:06.100
Groovy.

01:09.712 --> 01:11.755
What the hell are you doing?

01:11.756 --> 01:12.940
Sorry, Mommy!

01:12.965 --> 01:14.508
Don't you dare put that out.

01:14.509 --> 01:18.596
That is a perfectly good cigarette,
and you are going to finish it.

01:18.597 --> 01:19.763
But I don't wanna.

01:19.764 --> 01:22.057
And I don't want to be
the mother of a quitter.

01:22.058 --> 01:23.767
Finish it.

01:25.061 --> 01:27.605
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke
a cigarette right.

01:27.606 --> 01:30.982
Don't you dare cry,
don't you ever cry.

01:30.983 --> 01:32.150
You wanted this.

01:32.151 --> 01:35.654
Are you punishing me for smoking
or for stealing?

01:35.655 --> 01:38.174
I'm punishing you for being alive.

01:43.580 --> 01:44.930
Ugh.

01:45.415 --> 01:48.041
Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw
a lit cigarette off the...

01:49.085 --> 01:51.730
Fine. I'll call 911.

02:48.060 --> 02:50.395
The fire department got
everything under control,

02:50.396 --> 02:52.314
but the cable's out
for the neighborhood.

02:52.315 --> 02:54.483
I don't understand
what started the fire.

02:54.484 --> 02:56.360
Nobody knows where fires come from,
it's a mystery.

02:56.361 --> 03:00.155
Anyway, I am fired up
about my first day back on set.

03:00.156 --> 03:02.073
We're gonna finish
that big Nixon scene.

03:02.074 --> 03:04.743
We were just one shot away
before we went on hiatus.

03:04.744 --> 03:06.828
Yeah, I know.
You told me at breakfast.

03:06.829 --> 03:07.847
Why did you call me?

03:07.872 --> 03:09.789
Usually I talk to Diane
on the way to work,

03:09.790 --> 03:12.710
but she abandoned me to teach piano
in Cordovia or something.

03:12.711 --> 03:16.296
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me
because Diane wasn't available.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.275
You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill
in this Nixon scene.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.968
BoJack gonna be in "da" house.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.696
In da White House.

03:24.472 --> 03:27.558
What happened to da house set?
Da White House set?

03:27.559 --> 03:29.976
- Things changed a little.
- You cut the Nixon scene?

03:29.977 --> 03:32.270
The Nixon scene is the core
of the whole movie.

03:32.271 --> 03:34.773
Where we see Secretariat
be morally corrupted

03:34.774 --> 03:37.192
and get to look
into the real darkness of his soul.

03:37.193 --> 03:39.528
It's still all that,
except now it happens

03:39.529 --> 03:41.655
while you give a Christmas present
to your nieces

03:41.656 --> 03:43.990
and they hug you
while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.784
Is one of the nieces Nixon?

03:45.785 --> 03:47.578
Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

03:47.579 --> 03:49.889
People don't want
all that controversial stuff.

03:49.914 --> 03:53.041
But we were supposed to make
a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.

03:53.042 --> 03:55.711
- Warts and all.
- Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

03:55.712 --> 03:58.213
That's why they took the gay stuff
out of A Beautiful Mind.

03:58.214 --> 04:00.382
Know that guy who spent 12 years
as a slave?

04:00.383 --> 04:03.361
They don't talk about the 60 years
he spent as a jerk.

04:03.386 --> 04:05.220
- Kelsey, you're okay with this?
- Eh...

04:05.221 --> 04:06.346
That's showbiz.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.932
See, BoJack,
that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.

04:08.933 --> 04:10.660
Good shrugging, kid.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.105
Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...

04:15.106 --> 04:16.940
That's the end of your name.
We need to talk.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.442
We'll meet in the supply closet
in one minute. Break!

04:19.444 --> 04:20.795
Oh, okay.

04:21.279 --> 04:22.404
Ooh, ow.

04:22.405 --> 04:26.408
Carolyn, when you're in the throes
of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

04:26.409 --> 04:30.454
along with all that pain and degradation
comes a certain perfect clarity,

04:30.455 --> 04:35.626
and right now that clarity is telling me
that you and I should get out of here.

04:35.627 --> 04:38.128
Well, what do you mean,
"get out of here"?

04:38.129 --> 04:42.716
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,
and I want you to be my partner in crime.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.903
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.

04:44.927 --> 04:46.511
I've been here 20 years.

04:46.512 --> 04:48.096
Who's gonna water the plants?

04:48.097 --> 04:49.765
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

04:49.766 --> 04:51.391
I started doing it as an intern,

04:51.392 --> 04:54.311
but then no one told me to stop,
so it's still kind of my job.

04:54.312 --> 04:56.980
Carolyn,
you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

04:56.981 --> 04:59.065
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.443
Things are so crazy
for me right now. I...

05:01.444 --> 05:05.196
Don't give me that, you want crazy.
"Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song

05:05.197 --> 05:07.365
and your second favorite
Gnarls Barkley song.

05:07.366 --> 05:08.492
I don't want crazy.

05:08.493 --> 05:12.078
I've got five episodes
of The Good Wife piled up on my DVR,

05:12.079 --> 05:14.581
and I just want a night off
to enjoy them.

05:14.582 --> 05:18.460
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess
I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.

05:18.461 --> 05:21.963
- Gekko?!
- But I'd rather look at you all day.

05:21.964 --> 05:25.944
You're an amazing agent.
And you're bright, and you're fun.

05:25.968 --> 05:29.596
And I think we could make something
really special.

05:29.597 --> 05:32.850
We weren't doing anything!
We were just looking for closet supplies.

05:32.851 --> 05:36.311
Are you the person to talk to
about unclogging the toilet?

05:36.312 --> 05:37.855
Stuart, I'm your boss.

05:37.856 --> 05:41.065
Okay, but you're the one
in the janitor's closet, so...

05:41.066 --> 05:43.586
What, I'm the idiot?

05:47.031 --> 05:49.616
The first thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

05:49.617 --> 05:51.284
is that he speaks in paragraphs.

05:51.285 --> 05:53.829
Even I can't believe
how much good we've done here,

05:53.830 --> 05:55.413
and I'll believe almost anything.

05:55.414 --> 05:58.375
In the last six weeks,
we dug a new well, built a school,

05:58.376 --> 06:01.378
and next month
the community center is doing Seussical.

06:01.379 --> 06:02.587
There we go.

06:02.588 --> 06:04.506
In his previous life,
Sebastian owned

06:04.507 --> 06:06.216
a chain of high-end department stores.

06:06.217 --> 06:07.986
I want to stock up on muffs.

06:08.010 --> 06:11.489
We're going to sell a lot of muffs
this winter. Huzzah!

06:12.014 --> 06:14.683
Diane, I lived a life
of power and luxury,

06:14.684 --> 06:16.643
and then my picture
was in the newspaper.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.436
- A real-life newspaper!
- Uh-huh.

06:18.437 --> 06:20.313
But I knew my life was empty.

06:20.314 --> 06:23.316
At night I heard the cries
of children sick and dying.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.109
And I would scream into the night.

06:25.110 --> 06:27.696
Shut up! Shut up, children!

06:27.697 --> 06:30.657
But the phantom cries would not abate.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.409
And so I began my travels,

06:32.410 --> 06:34.912
with little more than a compass,
a yearning for adventure,

06:34.913 --> 06:36.788
and several crates full of unsold muffs.

06:36.789 --> 06:40.166
I knew there were people out there
just waiting for my help.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.210
Diane, this is Kinko.

06:42.211 --> 06:43.378
I am Kinko.

06:43.379 --> 06:44.796
In his language, it means,

06:44.797 --> 06:47.549
orphan whose parents were murdered
by rebels and will die young,

06:47.550 --> 06:49.092
probably from malaria.

06:49.093 --> 06:50.778
Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.

06:50.803 --> 06:53.555
It means,
my parents liked the show Cheers.

06:53.556 --> 06:57.935
Cheers! Oh, you're good.
You're very good.

06:57.936 --> 06:59.978
When Sebastian St. Clair says
you're good,

06:59.979 --> 07:01.855
you want to believe
that you really are.

07:01.856 --> 07:05.483
That you, like Sebastian, are part
of something bigger than just yourself.

07:05.484 --> 07:08.904
And for a moment,
you feel like you are.

07:08.905 --> 07:10.756
Oh, Kinko made a mess.

07:12.408 --> 07:17.287
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is
way more valuable than a Triple Crown.

07:17.288 --> 07:19.330
And cut. Neat.

07:19.331 --> 07:21.475
- Let's break for lunch.
- Oh!

07:23.502 --> 07:24.878
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.923
I had to touch three children today,
and one of them was sticky.

07:27.924 --> 07:30.258
Yeah, it was you.
Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

07:30.259 --> 07:33.112
- BoJack, there's nothing we can do.
- No, this isn't you.

07:33.137 --> 07:34.763
I've seen everything you've done.

07:34.764 --> 07:37.348
Your films are challenging and gritty,
and they're great.

07:37.349 --> 07:39.726
I'm not just saying that
because they're full of lesbians.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.228
Look, even if I wanted to finish
that Nixon scene,

07:42.229 --> 07:44.355
we don't have an Oval Office set.

07:44.356 --> 07:46.357
There's one at the Nixon Library
in Yorba Linda.

07:46.358 --> 07:48.318
Why on earth do you know that?

07:48.319 --> 07:50.695
In season three of Horsin' Around,
the horse got elected president

07:50.696 --> 07:52.071
and we shot on location.

07:52.072 --> 07:55.033
We can sneak into the library
and get the shot, guerilla-style.

07:55.034 --> 07:56.618
Once Turteltaub sees it,
he'll love it,

07:56.619 --> 07:59.179
and we can make the movie
we both want to make.

08:00.289 --> 08:03.500
- Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.
- All right!

08:03.501 --> 08:05.961
Did they really make
your character president?

08:05.962 --> 08:07.045
Only for season three.

08:07.046 --> 08:09.422
In season four, it turned out
it was all a dream.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.675
They called my airplane Air Horse One.

08:11.676 --> 08:14.445
And the vice president was
a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.

08:14.470 --> 08:16.304
- Come on.
- It wasn't our best season.

08:16.305 --> 08:18.699
But on the bright side,
was not our worst.

08:19.183 --> 08:22.560
Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...

08:22.561 --> 08:24.604
and steal the scale model.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.773
Welcome to my library.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.043
I'm Nixon..

08:29.735 --> 08:32.736
Yeah, you know,
some people say I look like Nixon.

08:32.738 --> 08:36.533
Not because he's my dad or anything.
That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.

08:36.534 --> 08:40.119
But if you have any questions about Nixon,
I'd be happy to answer them.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.706
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

08:42.707 --> 08:46.334
Is that the lighted exit sign
from Nixon's boyhood home?

08:46.335 --> 08:49.170
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

08:49.171 --> 08:50.588
- Is that...
- Here we go.

08:50.589 --> 08:53.758
...the handicapped drinking fountain
he used in the White House?

08:53.759 --> 08:55.510
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

08:55.511 --> 08:56.695
- Hang on.
- One more.

08:56.721 --> 08:59.138
- Is that the smoke alarm...?
- No.

09:02.267 --> 09:04.978
So the Oval Office is right here,
next to the men's room.

09:04.979 --> 09:08.065
I remember because season three
of Horsin' Around was a big cocaine year.

09:08.066 --> 09:09.858
All the pressures of being president.

09:09.859 --> 09:13.277
- I don't see how we'll pull this off.
- We're gonna need a crack team.

09:13.278 --> 09:16.280
First, we gotta get
the best lock-pick in the city.

09:16.281 --> 09:18.867
- Not interested.
- Okay.

09:18.868 --> 09:20.744
The second best lock-pick in the city.

09:20.745 --> 09:22.721
- No way I'm doing that.
- Got it.

09:22.747 --> 09:23.830
A lock-pick.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.248
Todd, can you pick locks?

09:25.249 --> 09:27.333
- Kind of.
- Great. You're in.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.960
We'll need an expert cat burglar.

09:28.961 --> 09:31.254
All right, Good Wife,
let's see what you got.

09:31.255 --> 09:32.881
Hey, Princess Carolyn!

09:32.882 --> 09:35.675
Kelsey and I are gonna break
into the Nixon library

09:35.676 --> 09:38.362
to steal a shot
for our Secretariat movie.

09:38.387 --> 09:43.349
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper
that stands to benefit you in no way.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.517
Are you in?

09:44.518 --> 09:46.352
Hey! Shut up down there!

09:46.353 --> 09:47.938
- You shut up!
- Make me!

09:47.939 --> 09:50.440
Hey, you got a problem?
Take it up with my agent,

09:50.441 --> 09:52.525
your downstairs neighbor
Princess Carolyn.

09:54.112 --> 09:56.195
We'll need someone to play Checkers.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.907
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.

09:58.908 --> 10:02.368
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.121
BoJack, I'd love to help you out,

10:04.122 --> 10:05.956
but I'm super-busy recording promos

10:05.957 --> 10:08.166
for television's
highest-rated new game show.

10:08.167 --> 10:11.377
- We can probably do it without you.
- This next one's for Seattle.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.547
Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.

10:14.548 --> 10:18.093
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Rain.

10:18.094 --> 10:21.488
It's too bad though because I could
really bring a lot to this project.

10:21.513 --> 10:24.766
The more I think about it,
Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

10:24.767 --> 10:26.434
It's just a single on Secretariat.

10:26.435 --> 10:30.354
Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.
What does Ethan Hawke know?

10:30.355 --> 10:33.817
- We'll find out tonight. So sorry.
- You know what? Forget I even asked.

10:33.818 --> 10:36.503
- Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.
- Okay.

10:37.113 --> 10:39.114
Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.

10:39.115 --> 10:42.492
Character actress Margo Martindale,
you've been a model prisoner.

10:42.493 --> 10:44.285
I'm glad I served my time.

10:44.286 --> 10:46.346
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

10:46.371 --> 10:48.123
and get back to doing small roles

10:48.124 --> 10:50.768
in critically-acclaimed films
and television shows.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.671
Watch, purse, lipstick,

10:54.672 --> 10:57.482
Emmy Award
for Best Guest Actress.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.889
I need your help with a break-in.

11:04.890 --> 11:07.892
BoJack, I've been out of prison
for two minutes.

11:07.893 --> 11:09.703
What took you so long?

11:13.232 --> 11:16.317
Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I
are gonna break into the library.

11:16.318 --> 11:19.403
But the problem is,
the place is crawling with cops.

11:19.404 --> 11:20.822
They're on high alert

11:20.823 --> 11:24.075
because some idiot
stole this model last night.

11:24.076 --> 11:26.410
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

11:26.411 --> 11:30.540
Who am I kidding?
I can't stay mad at you. You're adorable.

11:30.541 --> 11:34.418
Look at your big saucer eyes.
I can go swimming in them!

11:34.419 --> 11:36.963
- Totally.
- Now, we need to lose the cops.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.882
The rest of you will create a diversion

11:38.883 --> 11:42.969
by breaking into the only other place
in Yorba Linda of cultural significance:

11:42.970 --> 11:45.489
the Discount Fine Art Gallery
in the strip mall,

11:45.514 --> 11:47.891
between the tanning salon
and the adult bookstore.

11:47.892 --> 11:50.476
Once you set off the alarm,
all the cops will go there.

11:53.355 --> 11:57.234
Now, things could get ugly.
One of you is very likely to die.

11:57.235 --> 12:00.070
- Possibly Alan.
- Why possibly Alan?

12:00.071 --> 12:02.321
Well, you are the guy
none of us knows that well.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.157
I just came to fix your cable.

12:04.158 --> 12:07.410
Alan, you already know too much.
You're a part of this now, like it or not.

12:07.411 --> 12:09.954
- But...
- Hey, you think you could keep it down?

12:09.955 --> 12:12.874
I'm reading a script
and I'm having trouble focusing,

12:12.875 --> 12:15.210
so now my notes are
gonna be confusing and vague.

12:15.211 --> 12:16.127
We're almost done.

12:16.128 --> 12:18.088
I know you're having fun
with your police cars,

12:18.089 --> 12:21.465
I just wish you would have asked
before you invited these people over.

12:21.466 --> 12:23.801
- I live here, too.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

12:23.802 --> 12:26.637
And can you at least let Alan
fix the cable before he dies?

12:26.638 --> 12:30.242
I can't die. I'm endangered!

12:30.809 --> 12:33.853
"And the truffle-infused gnocchi
was the star dish

12:33.854 --> 12:36.981
at this up-and-comer that will please
the pickiest of Brooklynites

12:36.982 --> 12:38.691
and the less discerning Staten Islander."

12:38.692 --> 12:41.569
When I grow up, I can be food critic
for New Yorker?

12:41.570 --> 12:43.696
You can do anything you want in life.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.477
Not everyone can write for The New Yorker,

12:45.490 --> 12:47.450
but there's always The Atlantic.

12:47.451 --> 12:48.826
Diane,

12:48.827 --> 12:52.330
I'm concerned you're spending
a lot of time with this sickly child.

12:52.331 --> 12:55.458
Remember, you're supposed
to be writing about me.

12:55.459 --> 12:58.295
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?
To help these people?

12:58.296 --> 13:00.255
I'm here to help these people.

13:00.256 --> 13:03.716
You're here to help me help them
by writing a book about me

13:03.717 --> 13:06.928
so people back home will give money
to my foundation.

13:06.929 --> 13:08.239
Great.

13:09.932 --> 13:13.911
Okay, come on. Over here. Get it.

13:16.814 --> 13:19.190
We're in. It's too late to turn back now.

13:19.191 --> 13:23.069
One of us isn't going
to come out of this alive.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.862
Why do you all keep saying that?

13:24.863 --> 13:28.283
Why can't we all assume we're gonna
make it out alive and go from there?

13:28.284 --> 13:31.786
Alan, we've got enough problems without
worrying about your imminent death.

13:31.787 --> 13:33.663
Can't we just all shut up and do this?

13:33.664 --> 13:37.041
Why does everything have to be
a big, complicated mess?

13:37.042 --> 13:39.169
Like,
look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.

13:39.170 --> 13:40.628
It's simple.

13:40.629 --> 13:44.299
And serene. And... pleasant.

13:47.386 --> 13:49.929
I think that the vest
makes me look kind of chunky.

13:49.930 --> 13:53.325
I don't do CrossFit five days a week
to not look sweet in this uniform.

13:53.351 --> 13:56.311
I swear to God,
if you don't shut up about CrossFit...

13:56.312 --> 13:58.271
Break-in at the Discount

13:58.272 --> 13:59.897
Fine Art Gallery at the strip mall.

13:59.898 --> 14:03.609
Let's roll!
That's a thing we say at CrossFit.

14:18.917 --> 14:21.752
Remember when my character
on Mr. Peanutbutter's House was

14:21.753 --> 14:25.006
- elected president?
- Let me guess, it was all a dream?

14:25.007 --> 14:27.258
No, I served half a term,
then resigned

14:27.259 --> 14:29.510
because when Zachary
had a bad time with peer pressure,

14:29.511 --> 14:31.762
I realized I was spending
too much time being president

14:31.763 --> 14:33.491
and not enough time being a dad.

14:33.515 --> 14:35.451
It's like you didn't even watch my show.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.186
Okay, I'd like you here.

14:38.187 --> 14:40.438
And then you are going to be over here.

14:40.439 --> 14:42.399
- Freeze!
- I'm union.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.359
- Playing dead.
- Breaking and entering?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.861
That is against everything
Nixon stood for.

14:46.862 --> 14:50.073
We didn't mean to cause trouble.
We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.

14:50.074 --> 14:53.659
Yeah? What, another leftist screed
about how corrupt he was?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.036
- Uh...
- Or is it about how he had

14:55.037 --> 14:56.096
an illegitimate son,

14:56.121 --> 14:59.707
and the son never knew who his dad was,
but always had a hunch it was Nixon,

14:59.708 --> 15:03.521
and then that son grew up to be
the security guard at the Nixon Library?

15:03.962 --> 15:05.046
The second one?

15:05.047 --> 15:08.799
Well, if that's true, how come you don't
have an actor here to play Nixon?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.509
Because...

15:10.510 --> 15:14.805
we couldn't find anyone who could
appropriately capture his magic.

15:14.806 --> 15:16.908
You know, I do a pretty good Nixon.

15:16.934 --> 15:18.893
You? No way.

15:18.894 --> 15:20.437
Hello, I'm Nixon.

15:20.438 --> 15:24.648
I can't be at your soccer game, but I am
your father and I love you very much.

15:24.649 --> 15:26.234
Oh, my God. He's perfect.

15:26.235 --> 15:27.777
We've found our Nixon.

15:27.778 --> 15:29.820
I can be ready in five.

15:29.821 --> 15:31.298
Uh. Did we get the shot?

15:33.242 --> 15:35.594
It's so peaceful.

15:36.412 --> 15:38.204
- Okay, folks.
- Aah!

15:38.205 --> 15:40.790
Party's over.
That's something we say at CrossFit.

15:40.791 --> 15:43.251
Ugh. Wait a sec... I know you!

15:43.252 --> 15:45.753
You were in Justified.
You were amazing.

15:45.754 --> 15:47.088
Okay, you caught me.

15:47.089 --> 15:49.882
I am kind of
a well-known character actress.

15:49.883 --> 15:52.885
I am such a huge fan, Miss, uh...

15:52.886 --> 15:54.196
What...? What's your name?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.013
Sure, of course.

15:56.014 --> 15:58.617
Everyone loves my work,
but apparently not enough

15:58.642 --> 16:01.018
to watch the credits
and find out what my name is.

16:01.019 --> 16:04.397
The important thing is that we enjoy
your great performances, right?

16:04.398 --> 16:07.585
- How about you enjoy this? Aah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:07.651 --> 16:09.986
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.

16:09.987 --> 16:13.239
Oh, is that what we agreed to?
I thought we said "no gum."

16:13.240 --> 16:15.283
But you're also chewing gum.

16:15.284 --> 16:17.469
I'm a wild card.

16:18.329 --> 16:20.037
- Aah!
- Return fire!

16:20.038 --> 16:21.432
Watch out!

16:21.873 --> 16:24.041
Oh, no! Alan's dead!

16:24.042 --> 16:26.710
No, I'm fine.
The bullet hit my cell phone.

16:26.711 --> 16:29.922
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead!

16:29.923 --> 16:33.134
Nope, phone's fine, too.
Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.

16:33.135 --> 16:36.053
She's going into labor.
Guys, I'm gonna be a dad!

16:36.054 --> 16:37.514
See you later!

16:42.478 --> 16:45.229
Die, you chunky assholes!

16:45.230 --> 16:47.524
See, Jeff?
This is what I'm talking about.

16:49.026 --> 16:50.544
Shoot!

16:54.698 --> 16:56.258
Oh.

17:00.496 --> 17:04.999
- How could this be any more perfect?
- Yoo-hoo.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.502
Vanessa Gekko.
How did you get in this painting?

17:07.502 --> 17:09.002
I'm your servant, of course.

17:09.003 --> 17:11.839
In your infinite generosity,
you gave me this job

17:11.839 --> 17:14.425
when it became clear
that I don't have what it takes

17:14.425 --> 17:16.426
to be a "Hollywoo" power-agent.

17:16.428 --> 17:17.928
Also, my husband left me.

17:17.929 --> 17:21.516
And my children married each other
in an unholy incestuous union.

17:21.517 --> 17:24.202
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.

17:24.228 --> 17:26.896
How appropriate!
Fetch me drink, wench.

17:26.896 --> 17:28.873
- Right away, ma'am.
- Ah.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.568
Diane...

17:31.569 --> 17:34.695
The second thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

17:34.696 --> 17:36.780
is how much he talks about himself.

17:36.781 --> 17:38.366
This way is the library I built.

17:38.367 --> 17:41.035
And over there is the statue
of me building the library.

17:41.036 --> 17:44.247
And on that wall is a painting
of me posing for the statue.

17:44.248 --> 17:47.584
- Put a chapter in your book about that.
- Uh-huh.

17:47.585 --> 17:51.295
The only respite
from his constant bombast is sleep,

17:51.296 --> 17:53.106
and even then, sometimes...

17:58.470 --> 18:00.846
Everybody...
Those of you who can walk, I mean.

18:00.847 --> 18:04.326
...let's drag these corpses
to the mass grave behind the playground.

18:04.351 --> 18:07.228
We need to make room
for my new hospital.

18:07.229 --> 18:10.440
- Where's Kinko? Is he okay?
- Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.

18:10.441 --> 18:12.858
See, Diane,
I told you not to make friends.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.319
Jesus, you don't care
about any of these people.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.656
You're just using them as props
for your big-shot superhero act.

18:18.657 --> 18:21.325
Diane, the dead will not benefit
from our grief,

18:21.326 --> 18:25.955
but the survivors need a new hospital
and we need to build it.

18:25.956 --> 18:27.164
This is too much.

18:27.165 --> 18:29.292
If you're going to survive,
you'll need to harden up.

18:29.293 --> 18:32.211
I asked you to join me
because I thought you could handle it.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.648
- But if you can't, you can go home.
- I...

18:35.466 --> 18:36.674
I can handle it.

18:36.675 --> 18:39.944
Great! Let's drag some bodies!
Kinko! Oh, never mind.

18:40.804 --> 18:44.682
Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line
and I don't get a line?

18:44.683 --> 18:46.850
We only gave him a line
so he wouldn't call the police.

18:46.851 --> 18:51.397
- If I call the police, will I get a line?
- No, we won't use it in the movie.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.107
We only need the one-shot of me.

18:53.108 --> 18:55.693
I just think if he gets a line,
I should get a line.

18:55.694 --> 18:59.822
- Ugh. Actors.
- Okay, positions everyone. And... action.

18:59.823 --> 19:00.948
I'm Nixon.

19:00.949 --> 19:03.784
The way you're feeling
about your dead brother is how I feel

19:03.785 --> 19:06.054
about the son I'll never know.

19:06.079 --> 19:11.417
But I look at the moon and so does he.
That's how I know we're connected.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.876
And I'm Checkers.

19:12.877 --> 19:14.462
All right, so, BoJack,

19:14.463 --> 19:16.880
you've been told
that your brother, Jeffretariat,

19:16.881 --> 19:20.510
the one Nixon sent to Vietnam
in your place, is dead.

19:20.511 --> 19:22.553
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

19:22.554 --> 19:25.031
And the tears start to flow.

19:25.849 --> 19:27.391
And the tears start to flow.

19:27.392 --> 19:29.745
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

19:29.769 --> 19:33.147
Well, you need to.
This is the emotional climax of the movie.

19:33.148 --> 19:36.609
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front
of other people. I can't.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.901
Really, never? Come on.

19:37.902 --> 19:40.196
What if someone tells you
they'll take you to the park,

19:40.197 --> 19:42.865
and they keep talking about the park
and all the fun you'll have,

19:42.866 --> 19:44.116
but then...

19:44.117 --> 19:47.286
But then they don't take you to the park.
I need a second.

19:47.287 --> 19:51.290
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.
I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.268
Can you give us the room, please?

19:54.628 --> 19:56.879
There's a park right outside
we can hang out at.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.632
- Oh!
- Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

19:59.633 --> 20:00.776
Ah.

20:02.927 --> 20:07.783
Well, another beautiful, serene day
in magical fantasy-painting world.

20:09.434 --> 20:12.412
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may,
I have some exciting news.

20:12.437 --> 20:14.104
I just landed a new client.

20:14.105 --> 20:15.523
- The mill owner!
- Huh?

20:15.524 --> 20:18.108
We're doing a three-picture deal
about his waterwheel.

20:18.109 --> 20:20.152
- Wait, you're making deals here?
- I'll say.

20:20.153 --> 20:24.156
I'm now the biggest agent
in the entire idyllic New England village.

20:24.157 --> 20:27.410
It's like you don't even read
the idyllic New England village trades.

20:27.411 --> 20:28.661
What? No!

20:28.662 --> 20:32.289
You're polluting my perfect serene
dream life. Why is this happening?

20:32.290 --> 20:33.874
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

20:33.875 --> 20:36.835
But if you ask me, I don't think
you want perfect and serene

20:36.836 --> 20:39.129
and enough time to catch up
on The Good Wife.

20:39.130 --> 20:41.048
Stop kidding yourself,
Princess Carolyn.

20:41.049 --> 20:45.052
If you really wanted the simple life,
you'd have a simple life.

20:45.053 --> 20:47.471
Oh, my God. I gotta get out of here.

20:47.472 --> 20:49.658
Bye!

20:50.225 --> 20:53.370
Hey. Yeah, I got rid of her.
Now this place is all mine.

20:53.395 --> 20:55.187
Get your demo guys together.

20:55.188 --> 20:58.958
Let's tear this old Tudor down
and put up some condos!

20:59.484 --> 21:01.151
Okay.

21:03.988 --> 21:05.573
This isn't just for me.

21:05.574 --> 21:08.576
It's for John Carroll Lynch,
C.C.H. Pounder,

21:08.577 --> 21:13.080
and all the other character actors
who live in lucrative obscurity.

21:13.081 --> 21:15.708
The blood I spill today is for us all!

21:15.709 --> 21:19.897
I'm character actress Margo Martindale!

21:21.214 --> 21:24.592
Yeah, I'm going to go
with Princess Carolyn.

21:27.679 --> 21:28.988
Hmm.

21:30.849 --> 21:32.600
- Hello?
- Hey.

21:32.601 --> 21:35.245
There you are!
I've been trying to call you all week.

21:35.270 --> 21:37.814
- Yeah, the coverage in Cordovia is...
- Diane, Diane.

21:37.815 --> 21:39.440
Listen, I gotta tell you:

21:39.441 --> 21:42.234
I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about your trip.

21:42.235 --> 21:45.655
The truth is,
I really am so proud of you.

21:45.656 --> 21:47.281
A lot of people talk big,

21:47.282 --> 21:49.617
but you're actually out there
helping people.

21:49.618 --> 21:51.076
You're the real deal, Diane.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.621
- Yeah...
- How is it there? Is it amazing?

21:53.622 --> 21:55.766
It's... good.

21:56.291 --> 21:59.877
It's hard, but it's good.

21:59.878 --> 22:00.961
I miss you.

22:00.962 --> 22:03.130
I miss you, too, but I promise,

22:03.131 --> 22:05.675
these six months are gonna fly by.

22:05.676 --> 22:08.427
Yeah. How's the game show going?

22:08.428 --> 22:12.348
Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed
to be hosting a game show right now.

22:20.148 --> 22:21.249
I gotta go.

22:21.859 --> 22:23.400
And that's when you realize

22:23.401 --> 22:26.069
that the book you've been writing
in your head

22:26.070 --> 22:30.467
is never actually going to be a book,
so you stop...

22:33.953 --> 22:35.454
I know what you're gonna say.

22:35.455 --> 22:38.791
I'm a dumb sitcom actor
who's in over his head.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.502
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.

22:41.503 --> 22:43.546
And I'm sorry I made you come here.

22:43.547 --> 22:46.215
I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know what I'm doing.

22:46.216 --> 22:47.925
BoJack, sit down.

22:49.636 --> 22:53.597
You've just been told your brother is dead
and that it's your fault.

22:53.598 --> 22:55.349
But this moment is bigger than that.

22:55.350 --> 22:58.686
This is the moment
that Secretariat stops running.

22:58.687 --> 23:01.331
Because this is the moment you realize

23:01.356 --> 23:06.962
something inside you is broken,
and it can never be fixed.

23:09.573 --> 23:10.656
We got it.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.157
Really? I didn't cry.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.827
You didn't have to.
Turteltaub's gonna love this.

23:14.828 --> 23:18.455
- Oh. All right.
- Thanks for talking me into this.

23:18.456 --> 23:23.043
Just so you know, I'm really glad
we're making this movie together.

23:23.044 --> 23:27.024
- Didn't know I had it in me, did you?
- No, I knew.

23:27.382 --> 23:28.566
Huh.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.712
- Hold the elevator, please.
- Coming in?

23:49.153 --> 23:51.214
- I'm all in.
- Whoa!

23:55.368 --> 23:58.370
Mommy, it's nearly Christmas.
Where's Uncle Secretariat?

23:58.371 --> 24:01.457
He had to go win a race
against the Russians.

24:01.458 --> 24:04.543
But maybe, if he runs really fast...

24:04.544 --> 24:06.879
- Hey, where's Kelsey?
- Oh, yeah, funny story.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.298
Turns out you two knuckleheads
snuck out last night

24:09.299 --> 24:11.801
and got that shot
I told you not to get for the scene

24:11.802 --> 24:13.761
- that's not in the movie anymore.
- Uh...

24:13.762 --> 24:16.597
Silly me, I didn't like that.
So I fired her ass.

24:16.598 --> 24:18.515
- What?
- We got a movie to finish, okay?

24:18.516 --> 24:19.892
So, go get in costume,

24:19.893 --> 24:22.227
get your butt up that chimney,
and do your thing, Hamlet.

24:22.228 --> 24:27.291
Just maybe,
all we have to do is believe!

24:36.827 --> 24:38.076
What are you doing here?

24:38.077 --> 24:42.039
Hey, is it cool if I crash here
for a couple nights?

24:42.040 --> 24:44.976
I didn't know where else to go.

25:30.964 --> 25:34.151
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

25:35.305 --> 25:41.884
