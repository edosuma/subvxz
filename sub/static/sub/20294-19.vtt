07:17.500 --> 07:19.433
-Officer Roberts: I GREW UP

SO BY THE TIME I BECAME
A POLICE OFFICER,

07:25.067 --> 07:27.233
I WAS COMING TO THE JOB

07:27.333 --> 07:30.067
ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE ABLE
TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE

07:30.167 --> 07:33.667
ON A LEVEL WHERE I THINK
WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE.

07:34.933 --> 07:37.233
WE'RE HEADING OVER TO CHECK OUT
A SUSPICIOUS VEHICLE.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.667
A PEDESTRIAN SAID
THEY WERE WALKING BY

07:39.767 --> 07:41.933
AND THERE WERE
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE INSIDE

07:42.933 --> 07:45.467
-RIGHT HERE.

07:45.567 --> 07:47.067

08:04.600 --> 08:06.967

08:13.233 --> 08:15.400
-HI, LACEY.
THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL,

08:15.500 --> 08:18.067
BUT THE REASON
WE GOT CALLED HERE

08:18.133 --> 08:20.900
WAS BECAUSE THEY TOLD US
THAT YOU GUYS WERE DOING
SOME DOPE IN THE CAR,

08:21.067 --> 08:23.067
NOW YOU'RE SITTING THERE,
YOU'VE GOT A METH PIPE
IN YOUR HAND,

AND THEN YOU'VE GOT
YOUR BUTANE RIGHT THERE,

08:25.333 --> 08:26.800
AND BAG OF DOPE,

08:26.900 --> 08:30.133
SO, WHAT IS

08:45.300 --> 08:46.700

09:07.233 --> 09:08.733
STEP BACK THIS WAY.
-YEAH.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.267
-SEPARATE YOUR FEET FOR ME.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.367
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON YOU
THAT I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT?

09:12.467 --> 09:15.067
-NO. NO.

OF THIS CAR THAT'S YOURS?

09:15.133 --> 09:16.833

09:16.933 --> 09:18.433

09:25.733 --> 09:28.233
-MY DOG.
-I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOUR DOG OUT.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.667
STEP TO THE RIGHT
AND I'LL SHUT THAT DOOR
FOR YOU IMMEDIATELY.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.167
SO, THIS IS HIS CAR?

09:33.267 --> 09:35.067
-YES.
-WHY ARE YOU SITTING
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT?

09:36.067 --> 09:38.267
-JUST VISITING.
I'VE BEEN OFF AND ON
WITH HIM FOR FIVE YEARS.

09:38.367 --> 09:39.867
-SO HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND
OR WHATEVER?
-YES, HE IS.

09:39.967 --> 09:41.733
-OKAY. AND WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS SMOKING RIGHT NOW?

09:41.833 --> 09:44.167
JUST A LITTLE METH IN THAT CAR?
I SEE SOME BROWN IN THAT BAG.

09:44.267 --> 09:46.600
-SMOKING SOME.
JUST A LITTLE.
-OKAY.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.800
OKAY. COME SIT OVER THIS WAY.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.567
I'M GONNA PUT YOU IN THE BACK
OF THIS POLICE CAR OVER HERE.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.067
GO AHEAD AND HAVE A SEAT.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.167
SO, PRETTY MUCH WHAT
WE HAVE IS THE METH PIPE

09:58.267 --> 10:00.933

10:01.033 --> 10:03.600
AND AS MUCH
AS SHE WAS TELLING ME
SHE WAS SMOKING METH,

10:03.700 --> 10:05.167
THAT'S HEROIN.

10:05.267 --> 10:07.267
THIS GUY WAS SITTING HERE
WITH A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL
ON HIS LAP,

10:07.367 --> 10:09.333
AND THIS IS A SCALE.

10:12.033 --> 10:14.333
SO, MY GUESS IS
THAT THEY'RE SELLING
DOPE TOGETHER.

10:14.433 --> 10:17.067
AT THIS POINT,
SHE'S CAUGHT RED-HANDED.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.833
WE'LL SEE IF HE'S WILLING
TO LET HER TAKE THE RAP
FOR THE WHOLE THING

10:19.933 --> 10:26.067
OR IF HE'S GONNA MAN UP
AND ADMIT WHY HE'S GOT
THAT MONEY IN HIS LAP.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.500
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE
IN THIS PARKING LOT RIGHT NOW?

10:28.600 --> 10:30.567
-WE'RE ABOUT
READY TO GO AND PLAY
VIDEO POKER RIGHT THERE.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.967

THERE'S TWO MESSAGES
SITTING HERE RIGHT ON THE FRONT.

10:41.067 --> 10:43.233
I'M NOT OPENING UP THE PHONE.
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

10:43.333 --> 10:44.733
WHEN I LOOK AT THE PHONE.
-YEAH, I HEAR YOU.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.767
-WHAT DOES THAT SAY?
-"HOW MUCH FOR A 'G'?"

10:46.867 --> 10:48.600
-AND WHAT DOES
THE NEXT ONE SAY?
-"I GOT 10."

10:48.700 --> 10:51.100
-OKAY. WHAT DOES
THAT SOUND LIKE TO YOU?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.367
-I DON'T KNOW.
SHE DON'T HAVE A PHONE HERSELF.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.900
SHE'S BEEN USING MY PHONE ALSO.
-OKAY, SO THIS IS YOUR PHONE?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.467
-YEAH. BUT SHE DON'T
HAVE A PHONE.

10:57.567 --> 11:00.667
-"HEY, THANK YOU, BRO.
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU."
-YEAH.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.333

-"YO, I GOT FIVE BUCKS."
-UH-HUH.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.633
-"CAN YOU DO
ANYTHING WITH THAT?"
"I GOT 10... BRO."

11:21.067 --> 11:24.067
-MAN, I'M NOT USING,
I'M NOT SELLING DRUGS, MAN.
YOU DON'T HAVE A PHONE--

11:24.133 --> 11:25.867
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WITH A CELLPHONE, OKAY?

11:25.967 --> 11:28.967
AND THEY KNOW
HOW TO GET-- THEY--
-BRO? BRO? BRO?

11:29.067 --> 11:30.667

AND (bleeps).

11:32.333 --> 11:33.967
-OKAY, SO YOU'RE
ASSISTING HER DOING IT.

11:34.067 --> 11:36.133
-I'M NOT ASSISTING NOBODY.
-I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS

11:36.233 --> 11:39.733
YOU'RE SAYING PEOPLE
ARE CALLING YOU SO THAT
SHE CAN SELL THEM DOPE.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.933
YOU'RE NOT BEING HONEST
WITH ME. BRO IS YOU.

11:43.067 --> 11:46.233
YOU'RE THE BRO.
OTHERWISE THEY'D SAY
"LADY," OR "CHICKIE,"

11:46.333 --> 11:48.600
OR WHATEVER LINGO
THEY WANNA USE.

11:48.700 --> 11:52.367
YOU'RE IN THE CAR. COME ON.
YOU THREW A THING OF FOIL
RIGHT BEHIND YOUR SEAT

11:52.467 --> 11:54.633
AND THEN YOU THREW
A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL
UNDERNEATH YOUR SEAT.

11:54.733 --> 11:56.967
-NO. NO. NO. NO.
-AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
YOU'RE GETTING THIS MONEY

11:57.067 --> 11:59.467

12:06.600 --> 12:08.400

12:08.500 --> 12:11.200
DOING HEROIN THE WHOLE TIME,
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN IN.

12:11.300 --> 12:15.100
AND I NEVER REALLY
DID THAT (bleeps) BEFORE.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.700
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A TWEAKER.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.600
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
IT'S IN MY FILES,
IT'S IN MY M.O.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.067
-OKAY. I'M GONNA
BRING YOU BACK TO THE CAR.
I'M GONNA CHAT WITH HER.

12:24.167 --> 12:25.167
-OKAY.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.500
WE GOT A PHONE CALL
FROM A CITIZEN

12:27.600 --> 12:29.667
WHO WAS WALKING BY YOUR CAR
WHILE YOU GUYS WERE SMOKING UP.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.633
BUT WHEN I WALKED UP ON YOU,
CLEARLY YOU HAD A BAG
OF DOPE IN YOUR HAND

12:32.733 --> 12:35.567
AND YOU HAD A METH PIPE,
BUT I DIDN'T FIND ANY METH.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.867

OUT OF THAT PIPE?
-NO.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.800

ANOTHER BAG OF HEROIN,
AND A CELL PHONE THAT'S GOT
A BUNCH OF TEXT MESSAGES

12:51.200 --> 12:52.767
FROM PEOPLE ORDERING UP
DOPE ON IT.

12:52.867 --> 12:56.300
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU GUYS ARE SELLING DOPE
TOGETHER TO SUPPORT YOUR HABIT.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.533
DOES THAT SOUND
ABOUT ACCURATE? YES?

12:58.633 --> 13:02.167
OKAY. ARE PEOPLE
ORDERING UP ON HIS PHONE

13:02.267 --> 13:04.067
AND YOU'RE CARRYING THE DOPE?

13:07.233 --> 13:11.067
-NO.
-NO? SO WHERE--
WHO'S CARRYING THE DOPE?

13:11.167 --> 13:15.933
-TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THIS IS
ONLY THE SECOND DAY WE EVER
HAD THAT MUCH, SO...

13:16.067 --> 13:18.767
-SO YOU GUYS WEREN'T OVER HERE
TRYING TO MAKE HAND-TO-HANDS
IN THE PARKING LOT?

13:18.867 --> 13:21.100
-THAT WASN'T PART
OF THE PLAN, NO.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.667
-DID IT HAPPEN ACCIDENTALLY?
-YEAH, BUT IT WASN'T--

13:23.767 --> 13:25.767
-SOMEBODY JUST WALKED UP TO YOU?

13:26.867 --> 13:30.467
-SOMEBODY... THAT...
YEAH. I'M SO SORRY.

13:30.567 --> 13:31.933
-NO, IT'S FINE.

13:32.067 --> 13:34.400
-SO LAME.
-LISTEN. HERE'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.633
YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO JAIL
FOR POSSESSION OF THE HEROIN

13:36.733 --> 13:38.667
AND YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO JAIL
FOR THE DELIVERY OF THE HEROIN.

13:38.767 --> 13:42.167
WE'LL HELP YOUR DOG OUT.
WE'LL HELP MAKE SURE YOUR CAR
GETS TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO.

13:42.267 --> 13:44.767
WE'VE GOTTA MAKE
SOME BETTER DECISIONS.
-ABSOLUTELY.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.800
-LET THIS BE THE EVENT
THAT CHANGES YOUR LIFE.
-ABSOLUTELY.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.933
-Officer Cornelius:
I'VE BEEN WITH THE CITY
OF ATLANTA POLICE DEPARTMENT

13:54.067 --> 13:55.800
FOR EIGHT YEARS NOW.
I REALLY ENJOY WORKING
IN THIS CITY.

13:55.900 --> 13:59.233
IT HAS A LOT TO OFFER.
IT'S GOT DIFFERENT SPORTS TEAMS,

13:59.333 --> 14:01.167
IT'S VERY DIVERSE.

14:01.267 --> 14:02.833
I REALLY ENJOY WORKING HERE,

14:02.933 --> 14:06.867
AND I LOOK FORWARD
TO FINISHING OUT MY CAREER
WITH THE CITY OF ATLANTA.

14:06.967 --> 14:09.433
-WE JUST SAW A VEHICLE
PULLING OUT OF A GAS STATION.

14:09.533 --> 14:11.467
THE GAS STATION'S KNOWN
FOR HIGH DRUG USAGE.

14:11.567 --> 14:14.300
THE VEHICLE ALSO
HAS A BRAKE LIGHT
THAT'S MALFUNCTIONING,

14:14.400 --> 14:15.800
SO WE'RE GONNA
INITIATE A TRAFFIC STOP

14:15.900 --> 14:18.067
AND THEN INFORM THE DRIVER
OF THE INFRACTION.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.767
-JEEP CHEROKEE ORVIS, 1-9.
-WHAT'S UP, FELLAS?

14:22.867 --> 14:24.233
-HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
-I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

14:24.333 --> 14:26.067
-OFFICER CORNELIUS. THE REASON
WHY WE PULLED YOU OVER--

14:26.167 --> 14:27.933
YOU GOT A BRAKE LIGHT OUT.
-I JUST TRIED TO FIX THAT.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.233
-IS THAT WHAT
YOU WERE TRYING TO FIX?
-YEAH, IF YOU TURN IT,

14:30.333 --> 14:31.967
IT'LL TURN BACK IN.
-OH, OKAY.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.400
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT YOUR LICENSE ON YOU.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.500
-NO, I DO NOT. I HAVE A TICKET
FROM AN OFFICER YESTERDAY--

14:36.600 --> 14:38.500
HE GOT ME
WITH NO LICENSE.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.500
-DO YOU HAVE A LICENSE?
-YEAH, I DO HAVE A LICENSE.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.400
-OKAY. DO ME A FAVOR.
JUST STEP BACK HERE.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.300
WE'LL GET YOUR INFO
AND WE'LL GET YOU
RAN REAL QUICK.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.833
-WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR LEFT ARM?

14:46.933 --> 14:49.700
-(speaks indiscernibly)
-I SAW THAT.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.067
-(radio chatter)

14:52.167 --> 14:53.767
-THIS IS WHERE I SHOT.

14:53.867 --> 14:56.900
-I'M SORRY? WHAT'S THAT?
-I SHOT UP AND I-- THIS IS
THE OTHER DAY WHEN I MISSED.

14:57.067 --> 14:58.533
-YOU GOTTA SPEAK UP.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU. I'M SORRY.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.067
-I SHOT UP THE OTHER DAY
AND I MISSED.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.833
-YOU SHOT UP THE OTHER DAY?
-I'MA BE HONEST WITH YOU.

15:01.933 --> 15:04.333
-OKAY, THAT'S WHY I DON'T SEE
ANY NEEDLES IN THE CAR.
-NO, I DON'T HAVE ANY,

15:04.433 --> 15:05.867
BUT THIS IS NOT MY CAR.
-THIS IS NOT YOUR CAR.

15:05.967 --> 15:07.533
ARE THERE ANY NEEDLES
IN THE CAR THAT YOU KNOW OF?

15:07.633 --> 15:09.667
-NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
-HOW LONG YOU BEEN IN THE CAR?

15:09.767 --> 15:12.800
-HE PICKED ME UP FROM MY TRAILER
PARK ON CLEVELAND, RIGHT BEHIND

15:12.900 --> 15:14.600
THAT STRIP CLUB.
-OKAY.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.433
IF YOU DON'T MIND, MISS,
HOP OUT OF THE VEHICLE FOR ME

15:16.533 --> 15:18.833
AND STAND AT THE FRONT
OF THE CAR, OKAY?
-YES, SIR.

15:21.267 --> 15:22.867
-I DON'T HAVE MY--
I TOLD YOU I DON'T HAVE--

15:22.967 --> 15:24.933
-I'M JUST MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT THIS RIGHT HERE

15:25.067 --> 15:26.467
ON YOUR ARM.
-I KNOW. I WANNA STOP.

15:26.567 --> 15:29.800
-I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND.
SO WHY WAS THERE DRIED
BLOOD ON IT?

15:29.900 --> 15:32.900
-IT WAS... I DON'T KNOW.
-'CAUSE THAT'S A FRESH
NEEDLE MARK.

15:33.067 --> 15:36.100
-NO, IT WAS DRIED BLOOD. IT WAS.
-YEAH. THAT'S FROM
EARLIER TODAY.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.967

15:43.200 --> 15:44.967
-OKAY. WHAT DID YOU USE?

15:45.067 --> 15:47.167
-I USE ICE.
-WHAT'S THAT?

15:47.267 --> 15:48.300
-ICE.
-ICE?

15:48.400 --> 15:50.167
-I SHOT...
-METHAMPHETAMINE?

15:50.267 --> 15:54.200
-HOW ABOUT THE DRIVER?
DOES HE USE ICE TOO?

15:54.300 --> 15:55.967
-YES, HE DOES.
-YES, HE DOES?

15:56.067 --> 15:58.267
-I MEAN, I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT HIS BUSINESS,
BUT I WANNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.

15:58.367 --> 16:00.233
-YOU GOTTA WORRY
ABOUT YOURSELF, RIGHT?

THE DOG'S GONNA ALERT 'EM.

16:12.167 --> 16:15.167
-I KNOW.
-SO I'M GONNA WORK WITH YOU GUYS
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

16:15.267 --> 16:18.767
-THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO DO WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.
-OKAY, WHERE'S IT AT IN THE CAR?

16:18.867 --> 16:21.100
-IN THE FRONT.
-WHERE'S IT AT IN THE CAR?

16:21.200 --> 16:22.500

-IN THE FRONT?

16:22.600 --> 16:25.133
-I KNOW RYAN KEEPS THE STUFF--
-WHO'S RYAN? THIS--

16:25.233 --> 16:27.867
THE DRIVER?
-THE DRIVER. YEAH,
THE NEEDLE'S IN MY PURSE.

16:27.967 --> 16:30.500
-YOU GET YOUR NEEDLES
OUT OF PURSE.
-HE ACQUIRED--

16:30.600 --> 16:33.967
HE PURCHASED A HALF A GRAM.
-HALF A GRAM?

16:34.067 --> 16:38.300
-YEAH, HE PUT IT IN MY
PURSE, 'CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE...
-HE PUT IT IN YOUR PURSE?

16:38.400 --> 16:40.633

"HERE, WE'LL PUT IT--"
I PUT IT IN MY PURSE, 'CAUSE--

16:40.733 --> 16:43.400
-SO WHEN Y'ALL GOT IN THE CAR,

16:43.500 --> 16:45.667
-WE HAVEN'T GIVEN IT BACK.
WE JUST PULLED OUT.

16:45.767 --> 16:47.800
-I APPRECIATE YOU BEING
HONEST WITH ME, OKAY?

16:50.067 --> 16:51.767
-Ryan: ALL RIGHT,
AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN,

16:51.867 --> 16:53.767
I HAVE A RIGHT
TO A PRIVATE LIFE,

16:53.867 --> 16:58.300
AND A RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
NOT TO BE SEARCHED OR SEIZED,

16:58.400 --> 16:59.800
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.667
I MEAN, WEAPONS CHECK?
YEAH, MORE POWER TO YA.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.433
YOU GUYS ARE
ALL GOOD ON THAT.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.267
-OKAY.
-BUT I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT FOR MYSELF.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.933
-ALL RIGHT. LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU REAL QUICK.
-YES, SIR.

17:08.067 --> 17:10.600
-I WAS AT THAT
GAS STATION, OKAY?
-YES, SIR.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.833
-I WAS AT MANY
OTHER PLACES TONIGHT.

17:12.933 --> 17:15.133
-WE ALSO HAVE
UNDERCOVER OFFICERS
IN THE AREA TONIGHT.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.833
-YES, SIR.
-OKAY?

17:17.933 --> 17:20.133
SO WE DIDN'T JUST STUMBLE
UPON YOUR VEHICLE.

17:20.233 --> 17:24.533
-YES, SIR.
-I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT
THERE IS AT LEAST HALF A GRAM

17:24.633 --> 17:28.433
OF METHAMPHETAMINE
IN YOUR VEHICLE RIGHT NOW, SO...

17:28.533 --> 17:31.567
-I CAN PROMISE YOU THERE'S NOT.
-OKAY, YOU PROMISE ME
THERE'S NOT.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.900
-I DO NOT DO ANY SORT OF--
-LISTEN TO ME, LISTEN TO ME,

17:34.067 --> 17:37.400
-YES, SIR.
-THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY
CHANCE TO BE HONEST WITH ME.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.667
-YES, SIR.
-IF IT'S IN THERE...

17:39.767 --> 17:42.200
-YES, SIR.
-...AND I FIND IT,
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

17:42.300 --> 17:45.733
-MR. CORNELIUS, I HAVE
NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY DRUG
IN THAT CAR WHATSOEVER.

17:45.833 --> 17:47.967
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
HANG TIGHT FOR ME.
-ALL RIGHT.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.467
-(dog barks, panting)

17:49.567 --> 17:53.300
-ALL RIGHT, THE DOG HAS ALERTED
ON THE VEHICLE NOW.

17:56.900 --> 18:00.067
SO THIS IS GONNA BE
THE SANDWICH BAGGIE.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.667
THIS LOOKS LIKE
IT'S GONNA BE POSSIBLY HEROIN.

18:05.433 --> 18:06.800
EVEN THOUGH...

18:09.067 --> 18:11.067
THE PASSENGER TOLD US
IT WAS CRYSTAL METH.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.800
-ALL RIGHT, WHAT I'VE LOCATED
UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT
IS A METAL SPOON.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.167
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN USING IT
TO MIX UP THE HEROIN.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.933
WHAT I'M GONNA DO NOW
IS USE A FIELD TEST KIT...

18:24.467 --> 18:28.433
JUST TO TEST AND MAKE SURE
THAT IT COMES BACK HEROIN,

18:28.533 --> 18:31.533
MAKE SURE WE GET
A POSITIVE REACTION BEFORE
WE TURN IT IN AS EVIDENCE.

18:32.600 --> 18:36.667
YOU CAN SEE WE'RE STARTING
TO GET A DARKER GREEN COLOR
IN THERE, FLOATING AROUND.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.133
SO THAT'S GONNA BE
A POSITIVE REACTION FOR HEROIN.

18:39.233 --> 18:40.733
-I JUST SPOKE
WITH OFFICER BASURTO,

18:40.833 --> 18:42.500
HE WAS SPEAKING
WITH THE BACKSEAT PASSENGER.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.433
HE WAS SAYING HE DOESN'T
SPEAK ENGLISH AT ALL.

18:44.533 --> 18:47.767
HE WAS SAYING THAT THE DRIVER
WENT TO THAT GAS STATION

18:47.867 --> 18:51.767
WHERE WE SAW HIM AT,
AND HE WENT TO GO PURCHASE
THE HEROIN FROM THE GAS STATION.

18:51.867 --> 18:54.133
AND THEN HE WAS GONNA
SHOOT IT UP RIGHT THERE AS WELL,

18:54.233 --> 18:56.667
BUT THEN HE SAW US.
-THE FEMALE PASSENGER

18:56.767 --> 18:59.067
SHE ALSO MENTIONED WHEN I WAS
ASKING HER WHO PURCHASED IT,

18:59.133 --> 19:01.967
SHE SAID THAT
THE DRIVER DID, SO...

19:02.933 --> 19:05.067
-WE'RE GONNA TAKE 'EM BOTH?
-YEAH, THEY'RE BOTH
GONNA GO TO JAIL.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.200
WE FOUND THE SPOON
UNDER YOUR SEAT,

19:09.300 --> 19:11.700
PERFECTLY PLACED,
WHERE Y'ALL HEATED IT UP,

19:11.800 --> 19:14.167
SO IT'S IN YOUR WINGSPAN,
IN YOUR CONTROL,

19:14.267 --> 19:17.167
SO YOU'RE GONNA
GO FOR THE TICKET.
YOU'RE GONNA GET CHARGED

19:17.267 --> 19:20.567
WITH THE BRAKE LIGHT
AND THE POSSESSION OF HEROIN.

19:22.067 --> 19:25.067
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL
WHO YOU LET IN YOUR CAR
NEXT TIME, YOU KNOW?

19:25.100 --> 19:28.500
BE CAREFUL WHO
YOU HANG AROUND WITH,
WHO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.067
ALL RIGHT,
I HOPE YOU GET HELP.

19:32.133 --> 19:33.367
-RIGHT, THANK YOU.
-OKAY?

19:33.467 --> 19:35.967
-AND YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A HARD DRUG
TO GET OFF OF,

19:36.067 --> 19:39.633
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
BUT HOPEFULLY YOU TAKE
THIS AS A LESSON.

19:39.733 --> 19:43.400
-FOR ONCE,
I'M TALKING ABOUT REHAB
'CAUSE I'M SCARED.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.067
-HOPEFULLY YOU'LL USE THIS
AS A LEARNING TOOL

19:46.167 --> 19:47.733
AND JUST START
MAKING THE RIGHT MOVES

19:47.833 --> 19:49.500
TO GET THE HELP
YOU NEED, OKAY?
-YEAH.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.533
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.200
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.967
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:55.067 --> 19:56.067
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:56.100 --> 19:59.067
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.100 --> 20:07.033
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:07.133 --> 20:08.633
-(theme music playing)
