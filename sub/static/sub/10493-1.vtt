01:59.949 --> 02:03.034
Tier Four. First bed.
Come on, move it.

02:17.123 --> 02:19.833
Fear will kill you.

02:19.916 --> 02:22.459
I'm not afraid.

02:22.584 --> 02:25.127
Good. Right after chapel.

02:26.586 --> 02:28.587
It's goin' down in the yard.

04:34.728 --> 04:36.938
Not in here, motherfucker!

05:33.213 --> 05:35.589
Get on the ground!
Facedown! Don't move!

05:38.341 --> 05:40.633
You, get down!
Facedown!

05:41.884 --> 05:43.885
Put that head down!
Put that head down!

05:44.010 --> 05:46.344
Give me your arm!

05:46.386 --> 05:48.512
Don't move, buddy!
Don't move!

05:50.596 --> 05:52.180
Come on, move it.
Move it!

05:52.347 --> 05:53.973
Just stay down!

06:29.072 --> 06:31.032
Keep the change.

06:50.874 --> 06:53.167
Hi. I'm looking for the courtroom
where Mr Edward J. Dodd...

06:53.292 --> 06:55.293
is defending a Mr Nevins.

06:55.293 --> 06:57.794
<i>That's the Edward J. Dodd.</i>

06:59.086 --> 07:03.213
<i>Part 73, room 1113.
The room 1113.</i>

07:12.509 --> 07:16.802
...negotiated both to purchase
and to sell this dangerous drug.

07:16.844 --> 07:19.679
In a moment, you will hear
from counsel for the defence.

07:21.054 --> 07:25.723
As the People rest this case,
I leave you with this word of warning.

07:25.807 --> 07:29.475
Edward Dodd is an inventive lawyer.

07:29.558 --> 07:31.893
I'm sure he'd like you to believe...

07:31.934 --> 07:34.852
that the pound of pure cocaine
found in his client's apartment...

07:34.936 --> 07:37.895
was intended
for personal, recreational use.

07:38.771 --> 07:42.189
But just bear in mind,
only you can insure...

07:42.272 --> 07:44.357
that the defendant, who is...
let's be honest...

07:44.482 --> 07:48.567
a vermin, a vulture...
that he will pay a penalty.

07:48.609 --> 07:50.818
Thank you.

07:50.943 --> 07:54.737
Thank you, Miss Jessum.
Mr Sweeny, may I have a word with you?

07:57.279 --> 07:59.906
Roger Baron. Hi.
Sorry I'm late.

08:00.864 --> 08:03.657
It's such an honour
and a thrill to meet you.

08:04.366 --> 08:05.617
Really?

08:12.661 --> 08:15.830
So, what are you accused of?

08:15.913 --> 08:18.372
All sorts of things.
How about you?

08:18.497 --> 08:21.040
No, I'm a lawyer.
I just...

08:21.124 --> 08:25.167
I got into town today.
I'm working with Mr Dodd.

08:26.543 --> 08:29.919
Mr Dodd, would you care
to make your closing argument?

08:29.961 --> 08:33.087
- You're in good hands with this guy.
- I would, Your Honour.

08:40.466 --> 08:43.384
Cocaine...

08:43.426 --> 08:45.343
is evil.

08:45.426 --> 08:48.845
Selling cocaine is evil.

08:49.011 --> 08:51.513
Dislike this wicked merchant,
if you will.

08:53.472 --> 08:56.015
Loathe him, if you must.

08:56.056 --> 08:57.599
I do!

09:00.600 --> 09:04.519
But despise the tactics the police
employed to snare Brian Nevins...

09:04.644 --> 09:06.978
because we mustn't lose sight...

09:07.103 --> 09:09.688
of what this trial
is really about:

09:09.729 --> 09:12.981
our most basic personal freedoms.

09:13.064 --> 09:15.565
For when we condone the bugging
of our citizens' bedrooms...

09:15.649 --> 09:19.275
when we allow the police to enter
our homes without warrants...

09:19.359 --> 09:21.693
or with specious warrants,
at best...

09:21.776 --> 09:24.945
when we invade our citizens' privacy
in a frenzied quest...

09:25.028 --> 09:27.487
for a wicked white powder,
aren't we, in fact...

09:27.487 --> 09:29.655
capitulating to the evil?

09:29.780 --> 09:33.407
Aren't we surrendering to the drug?

09:33.490 --> 09:36.533
Aren't we saying that cocaine
is more powerful...

09:36.575 --> 09:40.035
than the Constitution
of the United States of America?

09:41.202 --> 09:44.829
Wow! What a speech.
It was beautiful.

09:44.829 --> 09:47.997
- Amazing horse shit.
- Amazing client.

09:50.081 --> 09:51.665
Eddie Dodd.

09:54.375 --> 09:55.667
Everybody should own one.

10:04.921 --> 10:07.631
Sorry about the mix-up back there.
I never actually saw your photo.

10:07.631 --> 10:09.715
- I read every civil liberties brief...
- It was nice meeting you.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.842
- I gotta get back to the office.
- you ever filed in the '60s.

10:15.843 --> 10:19.344
Roger Baron.
Overland undergrad, Michigan Law.

10:19.428 --> 10:23.138
None of this rings a bell?
You hired me to clerk for you.

10:23.221 --> 10:26.806
Remember my letter? "Top 5%, Harvard
Law Review, salary is no object"?

10:26.848 --> 10:28.891
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

10:29.057 --> 10:31.308
- Let me help you with some of that.
- Thanks.

10:31.308 --> 10:33.351
Here, I got it.

10:34.351 --> 10:36.394
- You comin'?
- Yeah.

10:36.477 --> 10:39.896
I was a sixth-year law student
when I read...

10:39.979 --> 10:42.022
your "Chase Manhattan Bombing"
case summation...

10:42.147 --> 10:44.273
in a '71 leftist law anthology.

10:44.398 --> 10:47.899
I know this sounds dorky,
but it kind of changed my life.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.944
- So, this is Greenwich Village, huh?
- Yes, Roger, you've arrived.

11:01.906 --> 11:04.532
Anyway, I got a hold
of a trial transcript.

11:04.574 --> 11:07.908
Your cross-examination of the cops
was like an indictment of the system.

11:08.075 --> 11:09.951
You were my age
when you defended that case.

11:10.076 --> 11:12.327
I was never your age.
Billy, this is Reggie.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.578
He's our new social conscience
on Sheridan Square.

11:14.578 --> 11:16.954
What about my court date?
What if we plead insanity?

11:17.121 --> 11:20.164
Both of us?
Okay, princess, you're next.

11:20.206 --> 11:23.165
- Billy, what is this thing?
- It's a sculpture.

11:26.542 --> 11:29.502
Now, what kind of pills
were you busted with?

11:29.585 --> 11:31.961
Mr Dodd needs to know.

11:34.254 --> 11:36.130
Is that an upper or a downer?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.353
Gabe! I'll take care of it.
Just park it on the bench.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.271
Park your ass on the bench and wait!
Gabe, you got a minute?

12:12.396 --> 12:14.522
I had a minute before the hearing,
but couldn't get you on the phone.

12:14.689 --> 12:18.524
I had reason to believe the judge had
heard of a concept called "entrapment."

12:18.649 --> 12:20.567
Gruner was busted with
three pounds of methedrine.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.818
Judge refused to exclude
the evidence. No deal.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.569
I'm deeply disturbed about
Detective Cedar's conduct.

12:25.569 --> 12:28.028
I may demand an investigation.
Can you imagine the headlines?

12:28.028 --> 12:29.696
I imagine the headlines,
I drool.

12:29.696 --> 12:32.656
"Undercover Cop Busts
East Village Speed Factory."

12:32.781 --> 12:35.907
Eddie, you're out of step.
Detective Cedar's a hero.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.449
He's a scumbag.

12:38.408 --> 12:41.201
Detective Cedar went undercover, huh?
So did Judas.

12:41.243 --> 12:44.744
Detective Cedar used his wiles
to insinuate himself...

12:44.786 --> 12:48.246
into the bosom of Clyde Gruner's life,
his home, his loved ones.

12:48.288 --> 12:49.538
Can't I take a simple piss...

12:49.622 --> 12:52.123
Detective Cedar broke bread
with Clyde Gruner.

12:52.290 --> 12:54.332
He was a guest
at Clyde Gruner's wedding.

12:54.374 --> 12:58.668
And, yes, Gabe, Detective Cedar
used drugs with my client.

12:58.668 --> 13:01.127
Not once, but many times.

13:01.169 --> 13:05.129
- You're gonna drag out that crap?
- Only if I have to.

13:06.463 --> 13:08.630
Be a mensch.

13:13.549 --> 13:15.167
Brian Nevins stopped by.
It's on your desk.

13:15.358 --> 13:16.900
Good.

13:18.109 --> 13:20.610
We pleaded out Clyde Gruner
to five years' probation.

13:20.652 --> 13:23.320
Score another point
for truth and justice.

13:26.154 --> 13:29.948
The last struggle for constitutional
rights is being waged over drugs.

13:30.156 --> 13:32.490
And we...

13:32.616 --> 13:35.492
are in the ring, Roger,
doing battle with Big Brother.

13:44.246 --> 13:46.247
Where are you goin'?

14:04.714 --> 14:06.673
Edward Dodd, please.

14:15.385 --> 14:18.470
I'm Roger Baron, Mr Dodd's assistant.
May I help you?

14:18.553 --> 14:20.554
Mrs Kim needs a lawyer.

14:20.721 --> 14:23.264
Her son killed a man
in self-defence in prison.

14:28.725 --> 14:30.851
He didn't belong there
in the first place.

14:31.017 --> 14:34.811
Eight years in jail
for the murder he didn't commit.

14:34.936 --> 14:36.937
I'm her neighbour's daughter.

14:37.020 --> 14:39.855
- Please, come in.
- Hi, I'm Eddie Dodd. What's up?

14:42.231 --> 14:45.399
Her son didn't shoot anybody.
He's the wrong guy.

14:47.108 --> 14:48.900
You meet him.

14:49.026 --> 14:52.027
You see he wouldn't go around
stabbing guys just for fun.

14:53.569 --> 14:55.612
This guy really shot a guy
and stabbed a guy?

14:55.737 --> 14:58.613
He didn't shoot anyone. Eight years
in jail for the murder he didn't commit.

14:59.989 --> 15:01.990
He's a good boy.

15:02.115 --> 15:04.991
And he comes from a fine home
in Seoul, Korea.

15:05.033 --> 15:06.534
- Shu Kai Kim.
- Shu Kai Kim?

15:06.700 --> 15:08.660
That's his name, Shu Kai Kim.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.579
I bet he is a wonderful boy.

15:16.997 --> 15:19.748
I mean, l...
I can't take this case.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.668
I have a specialty.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.794
Lawyers specialize.

15:31.128 --> 15:34.255
These days, I mostly do, like,
drug... narc...

15:35.255 --> 15:37.131
Anyway, I couldn't
even go see your son...

15:37.381 --> 15:39.340
without having a look
at the files from his case.

15:39.424 --> 15:42.633
So it's really out of the question...
Those are the files. Great.

15:46.427 --> 15:48.428
How did you hear about me, anyway?

15:50.054 --> 15:52.305
She went to all the court-houses.

15:53.430 --> 15:56.015
They all speak of you,
and they all say the same thing.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.974
Oh, wow.
What do they say?

16:02.934 --> 16:04.602
You do cases cheap.

16:13.856 --> 16:16.524
My associate and I
will review this material...

16:16.566 --> 16:19.734
as soon as possible,
and we will get back to you.

16:19.859 --> 16:23.069
In the meantime, I wanna thank
you ladies very much for stopping by.

16:23.110 --> 16:24.569
Thank you.

16:24.611 --> 16:26.195
Thank you for helping my son.

16:36.450 --> 16:38.576
Talk about a hard sell.

16:38.659 --> 16:41.494
"Thank you for helping my son."

16:41.661 --> 16:43.953
Attila the Hun had a mother, okay?

16:59.377 --> 17:00.711
Hit?

17:04.921 --> 17:08.548
That was close, huh? Almost
defended somebody who wasn't a dealer.

17:08.589 --> 17:11.049
Who knows?
He might even have been innocent.

17:11.132 --> 17:13.425
We have a full caseload.
Don't start.

17:13.508 --> 17:15.718
You're right. I forgot.
We're pledged to protect...

17:15.759 --> 17:17.719
every mid-level drug dealer
in the tristate area.

17:17.801 --> 17:20.053
It's an awesome responsibility.

17:20.136 --> 17:24.512
I don't venerate drug dealers.
To the contrary.

17:25.638 --> 17:27.640
- Of course.
- What we're attempting to do here...

17:27.682 --> 17:29.933
is check the government's attempt
to abridge our civil liberties...

17:30.016 --> 17:31.767
I know that.

17:31.808 --> 17:35.102
through informants, eavesdropping,
unreasonable searches and seizures...

17:35.227 --> 17:36.602
Right. You're right.

17:36.686 --> 17:38.562
Damn right I'm right.
Okay?

17:38.728 --> 17:42.855
It's just that I left behind
family and friends...

17:42.897 --> 17:46.023
and a couple good job offers
in Chicago.

17:46.107 --> 17:49.317
And in three dizzying weeks,
I've helped to acquit a coke dealer...

17:49.400 --> 17:52.068
- a speed dealer...
- I specialize, Roger.

17:52.151 --> 17:54.194
- an angel dust dealer...
- I'm not a kid any more.

17:54.319 --> 17:55.819
a speed manufacturer!

17:55.903 --> 17:58.946
So get a job on Wall Street.
I'm sure your rich daddy can arrange it.

17:58.988 --> 18:03.115
Look, don't tell me where to work.
I came here to work for Edward Dodd.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.991
But I just can't believe that
Edward Dodd has nothing better to do...

18:06.116 --> 18:09.909
than invoke exalted legal issues
to get off guilty little pricks.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.580
You wanna be
a criminal defence attorney?

18:18.705 --> 18:21.206
Then know this going in.

18:22.207 --> 18:24.749
Everybody's guilty.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.667
Everybody.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.631
You wouldn't have said that
ten years ago.

18:38.714 --> 18:40.840
Ten years is a long time.

18:45.384 --> 18:47.343
I'm tired, man.
I'll see you in the morning.

19:06.185 --> 19:07.936
A long time.

20:25.972 --> 20:28.181
- We're late. Let's get going.
- Where?

20:28.181 --> 20:30.474
Ossining Correctional Facility.
Sing Sing.

20:30.557 --> 20:33.100
Everybody's innocent there, man.
Just ask 'em.

20:34.517 --> 20:35.768
What was Kim in for?

20:35.809 --> 20:39.019
Killing a young Chinese gang leader
named Jimmy Chin.

20:39.061 --> 20:41.354
Prosecution said he did it
to get into a rival gang...

20:41.395 --> 20:43.271
the Pell Street Dragons.

20:43.313 --> 20:45.731
Kim admitted the gun was his.
He got 25 to life.

21:39.797 --> 21:41.048
Thank you, Officer.

21:45.842 --> 21:49.968
Mr Kim, my name's Eddie Dodd.
I'm a lawyer.

21:50.052 --> 21:52.803
This is Roger Baron, my associate.
He's also a lawyer.

21:54.345 --> 21:57.555
- My mother find you?
- That's right.

21:57.639 --> 21:59.890
Figures.

22:00.015 --> 22:02.099
You wanna tell me exactly
what went down here?

22:03.475 --> 22:05.642
Racist pig came at me.

22:05.684 --> 22:07.351
Exactly what happened then?

22:08.936 --> 22:10.353
I killed the motherfucker.

22:12.020 --> 22:15.230
Let's talk about what got you here
in the first place.

22:15.272 --> 22:16.940
Let's talk about Chinatown.

22:17.778 --> 22:21.363
The night Jimmy Chin was shot to death,
you were where?

22:21.529 --> 22:25.990
At the trial, you said you were
at your apartment that night, alone.

22:26.031 --> 22:27.574
Remember?

22:36.369 --> 22:39.454
It was eight years ago.
Long time.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.166
A real long time.

22:55.962 --> 22:57.963
God, I feel like I've been mugged.

22:58.004 --> 23:00.464
- That guy was so cold.
- He's a killer.

23:00.505 --> 23:03.465
What do we claim?
He stabbed the Nazi in self-defence?

23:03.507 --> 23:06.800
With knives taped to his hands?
We're taking the other case.

23:06.925 --> 23:09.301
- What other case?
- Chinatown, eight years ago.

23:09.468 --> 23:11.927
A gang leader gets wasted
in front of the tourists.

23:12.011 --> 23:14.554
The cops pressure the rival gang,
the Pell Street Dragons.

23:14.595 --> 23:17.888
They give up Shu Kai Kim, the kid
who's been trying to get in their gang.

23:17.972 --> 23:20.098
- You really think that's what happened?
- No.

23:20.139 --> 23:22.140
But it'll make one hell
of an opening statement.

23:22.224 --> 23:24.350
- Easy as that, huh?
- No, it's not easy.

23:24.391 --> 23:27.810
We gotta find some evidence that's been
buried to open this sucker up again.

23:27.893 --> 23:29.852
Christ, Eddie,
if the guy's really guilty...

23:29.936 --> 23:32.854
Only God and Shu know if he's guilty,
and neither one of them is talking.

23:32.937 --> 23:35.355
Besides, the guiltier he is,
the more he needs us.

23:35.438 --> 23:39.315
He's a victim. He deserves
to see the sun again, breathe the air.

23:39.398 --> 23:41.816
He's been in prison
too goddam long.

24:06.077 --> 24:08.578
Okay, come on.
Come on, man.

24:37.467 --> 24:40.760
So this was Shu back in '79.
Jesus.

24:42.552 --> 24:45.887
- It's the murder weapon.
- Alleged murder weapon.

24:46.012 --> 24:48.138
They found four of Shu's
fingerprints on it.

24:48.347 --> 24:50.973
When did you start moonlighting
for the D A? Put it down.

24:51.014 --> 24:53.641
God. I don't know about this.

24:55.558 --> 24:57.101
Neither do I.

24:59.602 --> 25:01.603
Wait, listen.
Thanks.

25:02.812 --> 25:04.771
"November 5, 1979.

25:06.230 --> 25:09.106
Cecil Skell
walked in the 5th Precinct.

25:09.148 --> 25:13.150
<i>Said he witnessed Chin's shooting.
Saw suspect's picture in Post.</i>

25:13.233 --> 25:15.276
Said Shu Kai Kim is wrong man."

25:17.068 --> 25:18.402
Cecil Skell?

25:18.527 --> 25:21.195
I didn't see his name on any
of the affidavits or the police reports.

25:21.237 --> 25:23.488
He wasn't on any witness lists.
How could they miss this guy?

25:25.697 --> 25:27.823
Also says he knows
who killed Kennedy.

25:28.948 --> 25:31.033
Keep lookin'.
Something will turn up.

25:39.537 --> 25:41.871
Boys, it's cleanup time.

25:41.954 --> 25:43.330
Jesus.

25:43.372 --> 25:45.456
Ten minutes, Tom, okay?

25:46.665 --> 25:48.582
Um, that DD-5.

25:48.666 --> 25:50.750
The one about the maniac who...

25:50.875 --> 25:53.585
Cecil Skell.
Find it.

26:04.798 --> 26:06.007
Hi, Kitty.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.968
Roger Baron, Kitty Greer.
Private investigator.

26:12.093 --> 26:15.220
Roger's my new associate.
Top of his class at Michigan Law.

26:15.261 --> 26:19.096
Eddie's "Chase Manhattan Bombing"
summation kind of change your life?

26:19.138 --> 26:22.473
- You told her about that?
- Yeah. So, what have you got?

26:22.515 --> 26:25.641
My skip-trace turned up
two Cecil Skells.

26:25.766 --> 26:29.351
One's in Butte, Montana. The other's
at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.

26:29.435 --> 26:32.853
- I take odds on Cecil two.
- What'd he do? Snitch off a dealer?

26:34.312 --> 26:37.355
- Murder witness.
- You're doing a murder case?

26:37.438 --> 26:40.481
<i>It hasn't been that long.</i>

26:40.606 --> 26:42.899
Cecil Skell's one of three eyewitnesses
who came forward.

26:42.982 --> 26:45.025
You gotta start looking
for the other two right away.

26:47.151 --> 26:49.527
- I'm not working on this case.
- Yes, you are.

26:49.694 --> 26:52.737
You boys have fun.
I have business back on Planet Earth.

26:52.820 --> 26:56.280
Let me guess. Some corporate VP
is banging his secretary over lunch...

26:56.364 --> 26:58.573
and you gotta focus your camera
and plug in your tape recorder.

26:58.740 --> 27:01.741
Beats getting paid in 20s by slime dogs
selling angel dust to high school kids.

27:01.866 --> 27:05.785
Where do you put your microphone to get
the most incriminating moans and sighs?

27:05.868 --> 27:07.827
You know, a law degree's
a terrible thing to waste.

27:07.994 --> 27:11.871
- Do your parents know you're here?
- You can't pick on him.

27:11.912 --> 27:14.622
You've just blown your chance
to participate in this case.

27:14.664 --> 27:17.540
- I'm sorry.
- I'm kicking myself right out of here.

27:20.458 --> 27:22.709
We got her.

27:37.924 --> 27:40.425
The head nurse said that...

27:40.509 --> 27:42.426
you guys needed to talk to me.

27:43.677 --> 27:45.303
Cecil?

27:52.056 --> 27:56.474
I'm Eddie Dodd. I'm a lawyer.
This is Roger Baron, also a lawyer.

27:56.516 --> 27:58.392
Why don't you sit down?

28:01.060 --> 28:04.311
Mr Skell,
a young man named Jimmy Chin...

28:04.353 --> 28:07.063
was shot and killed
eight years ago in Chinatown.

28:07.104 --> 28:09.189
Do you remember talking
to the police?

28:09.230 --> 28:14.191
That guy that they arrested,
he was the wrong guy.

28:14.358 --> 28:16.525
Cecil, we wanna reopen this case.

28:16.650 --> 28:19.944
But we can't do it
without your testimony.

28:20.902 --> 28:24.279
I wanna use what you have
to say so badly.

28:24.321 --> 28:28.797
But I must add that I think
you're fucking full of shit, all right?

28:29.675 --> 28:33.010
I think what Eddie means to say is...

28:33.052 --> 28:35.428
No, no, no.
They got the wrong guy.

28:35.428 --> 28:38.429
I saw it.
The killer wasn't Chinese.

28:38.596 --> 28:41.139
Oh, come on.
Not Chinese.

28:41.347 --> 28:44.223
The Chinese have an energy field...

28:44.390 --> 28:47.767
that vibrates
at a particular frequency.

28:49.643 --> 28:52.144
Oh, right. Right.

28:53.311 --> 28:55.979
Cecil, what is all this
about the Kennedy assassination?

28:59.814 --> 29:03.607
You guys... you're from the company.
I should've known.

29:03.732 --> 29:05.275
What, CIA?

29:05.400 --> 29:09.152
- No, man, the telephone.
- What?

29:09.152 --> 29:12.111
I suppose you don't know that
the phone company killed Kennedy...

29:12.236 --> 29:16.280
because he was trying to break it up,
and they'll never let that happen.

29:16.447 --> 29:18.489
They control everything.

29:18.531 --> 29:20.532
What you say in the mouthpiece...

29:20.699 --> 29:24.075
is never exactly
what comes out the other end.

29:24.117 --> 29:26.368
<i>The phone company
was broken up.</i>

29:26.493 --> 29:28.494
And you believe that?

29:28.535 --> 29:32.371
<i>The phone company broke up in 1981.
I can get a back issue of Business Week.</i>

29:32.371 --> 29:35.038
Excuse me, fellas.
What, are you kidding?

29:51.671 --> 29:53.630
Are you what heroes are made of?

29:55.715 --> 29:58.007
I did two tours in 'Nam.

29:59.675 --> 30:03.468
Are you willing to testify
that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin...

30:03.510 --> 30:05.886
was not the man
the police arrested?

30:09.054 --> 30:11.305
They got the wrong guy.

30:11.472 --> 30:13.931
That's right.

30:13.931 --> 30:16.474
When the D A gets wind of this,
he's gonna send somebody out here...

30:16.557 --> 30:21.726
claiming to be a journalist or maybe
a phone company representative.

30:21.768 --> 30:25.186
He's gonna ask you
a lot of questions.

30:25.353 --> 30:27.813
You just be truthful.

30:27.896 --> 30:30.897
Okay? To all of us.

30:30.939 --> 30:33.857
I always tell the truth.

30:33.899 --> 30:36.733
That's why I'm here.

30:39.776 --> 30:41.986
Very good, Mr Skell.
And you told the desk sergeant...

30:42.027 --> 30:44.987
you were certain that Shu Kai Kim
wasn't the killer.

30:45.029 --> 30:46.988
Is that right?

30:47.071 --> 30:49.031
It's important to give
a vocal response.

30:49.197 --> 30:52.782
- Yes, sir.
- You left your telephone number.

30:52.866 --> 30:56.576
Did the police attempt to phone you
or to follow up in any way?

30:58.743 --> 31:00.077
No, sir.

31:00.244 --> 31:03.662
- Thank you, Mr Skell.
- Mr Rabin, you may cross-examine.

31:03.787 --> 31:06.330
How long have you been
a patient at...

31:06.372 --> 31:09.415
Objection. The fact the witness is
a patient at any hospital is immaterial.

31:09.540 --> 31:11.166
Sustained.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.959
All right. How long have you resided
at the Riverhead...

31:14.084 --> 31:16.543
This is the same question
in sheep's clothing.

31:16.668 --> 31:20.462
Mr Rabin, you're out of line.
Next question.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.671
Thank you.

31:22.713 --> 31:25.214
Mr Skell.

31:25.214 --> 31:29.883
You're under oath to tell the truth,
Mr Skell...

31:29.966 --> 31:32.259
and nothing but the truth.

31:32.384 --> 31:34.552
Who killed President John F. Kennedy?

31:34.635 --> 31:37.094
Objection. This witness is not
an expert in political assassinations.

31:37.219 --> 31:39.721
- The question relates to...
- He wasn't on the Warren Commission!

31:39.804 --> 31:42.597
Do you think he was on the grassy knoll
with a pair of binoculars?

31:42.764 --> 31:47.349
- I'd like to answer the question.
- We're talking about competency...

31:47.349 --> 31:51.809
Mr Rabin has no right to ask
this question! Don't answer it!

31:57.354 --> 31:58.437
Lee...

32:00.689 --> 32:02.564
Harvey...

32:05.441 --> 32:06.650
Oswald.

32:08.984 --> 32:10.735
Never mind, Your Honour.

32:12.194 --> 32:14.153
Objection withdrawn, Your Honour.

32:19.405 --> 32:22.699
Shu, the judge has ordered a retrial
in the Chinatown murder case.

32:22.782 --> 32:25.742
If we can prove reasonable doubt
on your imprisonment eight years ago...

32:25.825 --> 32:29.077
we feel sure that the D A will drop
the charge in the prison knifing.

32:30.327 --> 32:33.787
- Do I have to be in the courtroom?
- There's probably not gonna be a trial.

32:33.829 --> 32:36.246
The State's not gonna wanna retry
an eight-year-old murder case.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.581
Neither are we.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.332
At the pretrial conference,
an offer will be made.

32:41.374 --> 32:45.126
Odds are we'll cut some kind of deal.
Maybe, just maybe...

32:45.251 --> 32:47.085
we'll get you out of here
much sooner.

32:47.168 --> 32:49.544
You've done enough time.

32:49.669 --> 32:53.338
Mr Dodd would like to help you
in such a case, but...

32:53.421 --> 32:55.547
- Kitty.
- Hi, Billy.

32:55.630 --> 32:59.257
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not entirely sure.

32:59.382 --> 33:01.216
Oh, excuse me.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.551
The cops tell their experts,
"Don't sweat it.

33:03.676 --> 33:05.677
We got three people
who saw this guy fire the gun."

33:05.760 --> 33:07.719
Meanwhile, they're telling
their eyewitnesses...

33:07.803 --> 33:10.220
"Don't doubt your I.D. Our experts
can tie the suspect to the gun."

33:10.345 --> 33:12.430
- It's a game, Roger.
- Thanks a lot.

33:12.513 --> 33:14.431
What do you got?

33:14.472 --> 33:17.724
One of the prosecution's
three eyewitnesses passed away.

33:17.807 --> 33:19.891
- Another one moved to Canada.
- Same thing.

33:19.975 --> 33:22.226
They still have Laura Gayley,
the computer programmer.

33:22.393 --> 33:25.769
She was the closest one.
Like, 21 feet from the killer.

33:26.936 --> 33:29.146
Do you have to do that?

33:29.187 --> 33:32.772
- Do you?
- Have to? No.

33:34.398 --> 33:36.607
- Start lookin' into Shu's gang.
- The Pell Street Dragons?

33:36.691 --> 33:39.234
Yeah. Billy!
Yo, babe!

33:41.068 --> 33:43.402
See what rank did the hits
back in '79.

33:43.486 --> 33:45.945
Your extensive law enforcement contacts
should be of some help.

33:46.028 --> 33:48.738
I was never politically correct enough
for Comrade Dodd.

33:48.863 --> 33:51.906
Yeah, law offices
of Edward J. Dodd.

33:52.031 --> 33:55.324
Who? Sure.
Yeah, put him through.

33:59.368 --> 34:01.869
Yes, I can.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.870
Okay. Thank you.

34:07.997 --> 34:10.123
That was Robert Reynard.

34:10.206 --> 34:11.623
Robert Reynard?

34:11.665 --> 34:13.166
The Manhattan D A?

34:35.676 --> 34:38.636
- Excuse me. May I help you, sir?
- Robert Reynard, please.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.719
Would you like to check the coat, sir?

34:40.762 --> 34:43.804
- No, it's fine.
- Right this way.

34:43.929 --> 34:47.306
- What do we make? Lawyers.
- Do you think that's the root of it?

34:47.431 --> 34:49.516
It all boils down
to goods versus services.

34:51.433 --> 34:54.310
Excuse me, Mr Reynard.

34:54.476 --> 34:55.976
Edward J. Dodd.

34:56.018 --> 34:59.062
Robert Reynard.
Thank you, George.

34:59.145 --> 35:02.522
Of course, you know Dean Rabin,
one of my assistant D As.

35:02.522 --> 35:06.023
Dean generally handles
the nuisance cases, like the, uh...

35:06.023 --> 35:07.441
What's the man's name?

35:07.566 --> 35:09.984
- Sh...
- Shu Kai Kim.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.110
His name is Shu Kai Kim.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.611
You won't remember this,
but in '72...

35:15.695 --> 35:17.779
I was one of several
prosecutors assigned...

35:17.862 --> 35:20.030
to the police-Black Panther
shoot-out.

35:20.155 --> 35:24.324
You walked into court by yourself
and kicked our collective butt.

35:25.783 --> 35:27.783
- What have you been up to since then?
- This and that.

35:27.992 --> 35:31.410
My staff tells me
it's mostly been drug pushers.

35:31.410 --> 35:33.411
I said, "That can't be
the same Edward Dodd."

35:33.453 --> 35:36.746
It's in narcotics that the government
tramples on the 4th Amendment.

35:36.604 --> 35:41.065
Well, let's not drag
the Constitution into this.

35:41.231 --> 35:44.775
You used the testimony
of a paranoid schizophrenic...

35:44.816 --> 35:46.776
to overturn a murder conviction...

35:46.901 --> 35:49.027
that's withstood challenge
for over eight years.

35:49.068 --> 35:51.153
And until we get
the death penalty reinstated...

35:51.278 --> 35:53.946
we depend on our ability
to make long sentences stick.

35:54.071 --> 35:56.363
And the hell with my client's
civil rights?

35:56.447 --> 35:58.072
Your client...

35:58.114 --> 35:59.823
is guilty.

36:02.449 --> 36:05.659
I know a little something
about street gangs, Ed.

36:05.909 --> 36:08.160
Back in the '70s,
I spent years putting away kingpins...

36:08.244 --> 36:10.245
in a Colombian crime syndicate.

36:10.328 --> 36:14.497
If we can't protect this city
from incorrigible street assassins...

36:14.580 --> 36:16.706
then my office isn't worth a damn.

36:18.749 --> 36:21.166
What's on your wish list, Ed?

36:21.291 --> 36:24.084
Pleading Kim out to "man one"
in both homicides?

36:24.293 --> 36:27.044
- What are you looking for here?
- Sentences to run concurrent?

36:27.086 --> 36:29.670
- Fifteen to life, both counts.
- Fifteen is insulting.

36:29.837 --> 36:32.088
Friday's the drop-dead date
on the offer.

36:33.088 --> 36:35.089
Don't bullshit me,
okay, Mr Reynard?

36:35.131 --> 36:37.132
You got witness problems,
you got proof problems.

36:37.174 --> 36:41.009
You're my only problem. What's it
gonna take to make you go away?

36:41.134 --> 36:44.010
Eight-and-a-third, both counts to run
concurrent, credit for time served.

36:44.135 --> 36:46.011
Yeah.

36:46.053 --> 36:48.554
And your man walks out next month.

36:48.721 --> 36:50.680
What are you doing?
You joking here?

36:50.763 --> 36:52.639
Joking?

36:52.681 --> 36:55.265
I never joke about waving a client's
Sixth Amendment right to trial.

36:55.432 --> 36:57.308
You're starting to piss me off.

36:58.934 --> 37:00.935
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day.

37:00.976 --> 37:04.019
My client's had
a tough eight years behind bars.

37:04.103 --> 37:06.854
Why don't you sleep on that?
Then make me an offer.

37:09.105 --> 37:11.356
After Friday, no deal.

37:19.068 --> 37:22.403
The Japanese shellac us
month after month...

37:22.569 --> 37:24.946
Excuse me.

37:32.032 --> 37:35.325
<i>Len Davis, Daily News. Looks like
you've wriggled up Reynard's ass.</i>

37:35.409 --> 37:37.326
Sorry, no comment.

37:38.827 --> 37:40.911
I'm not saying
it was a conspiracy exactly.

37:40.953 --> 37:42.954
Law enforcement is
too disorganized for that.

37:42.996 --> 37:46.122
I suspect sloth is the culprit.
Lassitude.

37:47.748 --> 37:49.373
"Edward J. Dodd,
retained to defend Mr Kim...

37:49.457 --> 37:53.667
has disclosed that a witness
will corroborate Mr Kim's alibi."

37:53.709 --> 37:55.418
- I embellished.
- "Dodd also reports that...

37:55.668 --> 37:58.503
<i>- his team of private investigators...
- I embroidered.</i>

37:58.544 --> 38:01.004
are actually close to naming
the man they believe...

38:01.087 --> 38:04.089
- actually killed Jimmy Chin."
- I lied.

38:04.255 --> 38:06.965
You should've used the one about Shu
being the bastard son of Mother Teresa.

38:07.007 --> 38:09.007
I actually like that.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.968
I'm tired.
I'm gonna go home and go to bed.

38:14.051 --> 38:16.844
- Thanks for the drinks, kids.
- Good night.

38:17.053 --> 38:19.304
Good night, Danny.
Thank you.

38:37.729 --> 38:39.730
Hey, bro.

38:41.689 --> 38:43.440
- Can you spare a quarter, man?
- Yeah.

38:45.441 --> 38:47.817
I'm real hungry, man.

39:01.323 --> 39:04.366
Gook lover!
Race traitor!

39:19.415 --> 39:21.707
Enemy of the Aryan people!

39:21.874 --> 39:25.209
Commie faggot!
Motherfucker!

39:25.251 --> 39:26.626
Jew!

39:26.668 --> 39:29.253
Only half.

39:29.378 --> 39:31.754
Aryan Army say:

39:31.795 --> 39:34.755
Chink go to trial, you die.

39:43.009 --> 39:45.760
<i>Dodd, you take on a client
who wasted a Nazi in prison...</i>

39:45.927 --> 39:48.511
you gotta expect the Nazis
are gonna come back at ya.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.095
Oh, Eddie deserved this?

39:50.220 --> 39:52.597
I guess rape victims
wanna be laid at gunpoint?

39:52.763 --> 39:54.389
Well, it's a fact of life.

39:54.514 --> 39:57.015
These folks just don't
spray swastikas on synagogues.

39:57.015 --> 39:58.891
They take care of their own.

40:00.350 --> 40:04.144
Those teardrop tattoos,
they're like notches on a gun.

40:04.185 --> 40:06.311
One for every enemy they kill.

40:22.027 --> 40:24.028
Listen, I'm...

40:24.153 --> 40:27.071
I think I'm gonna look
some more tomorrow.

40:27.279 --> 40:29.197
I'm seeing double here.

40:35.116 --> 40:37.492
- Ow! God!
- Sorry.

40:37.617 --> 40:40.243
His name's Chuckie Loeder.
Something's very weird.

40:40.327 --> 40:44.412
- You saw his mug shot?
- Those tears, they weren't real.

40:46.121 --> 40:50.873
I can't believe we're going to see
a bunch of Nazis at night.

40:50.915 --> 40:52.916
There's no one else to talk to.
The tattoos are phoney.

40:52.958 --> 40:54.875
- So?
- So no upstanding member...

40:54.958 --> 40:57.084
of the Aryan Army
would paint them on.

40:57.126 --> 40:59.085
They take those tear-drops
very seriously.

40:59.127 --> 41:01.461
They're badges of honour,
of courage.

41:01.587 --> 41:05.213
Only their most vicious, sadistic,
cruel, killer elite get to wear them.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.381
I feel much better now.

41:09.423 --> 41:12.008
Clyde Gruner sold these guys
a pound of crystal meth at cost.

41:12.050 --> 41:14.426
I mean, we're Clyde's buddies.

41:46.732 --> 41:49.233
Hi. Is your daddy home?

42:14.203 --> 42:16.121
We're friends of Clyde Gruner.

42:17.038 --> 42:19.205
We know who you are.
You're the race traitor...

42:19.372 --> 42:21.582
who's defending the gook
that murdered Duane.

42:21.582 --> 42:24.875
- You got a lot of balls coming here.
- What the hell you want?

42:29.085 --> 42:31.795
I'm real sorry about Duane.

42:31.878 --> 42:35.046
I got jumped by a man earlier tonight.
He said he was Aryan Army.

42:35.171 --> 42:37.756
- His name's Chuckie Loeder.
- "Chuck" rhymes with "suck."

42:37.881 --> 42:39.381
Right.

42:39.548 --> 42:42.299
Chuckie Loeder's no longer a brother
in the resurrection of our nation.

42:42.341 --> 42:44.425
We expelled that faggot junkie
a year ago.

42:44.509 --> 42:47.218
- Do you know where he might be found?
- Hanging with his tongue out...

42:47.302 --> 42:50.595
and a sign around his neck that says,
"I betrayed my race..."

42:50.637 --> 42:53.805
along with the rest of society's scum
on the Great Day of the Rope."

42:57.265 --> 43:00.599
Prior to the Great Day of the Rope,
where can he be found?

43:00.683 --> 43:02.600
Mixing with mongrel races.

43:02.684 --> 43:05.893
Anything along the lines
of an address or a job?

43:06.060 --> 43:07.686
Art supplies, right?

43:12.855 --> 43:15.981
Now, get the fuck out of here.

43:16.107 --> 43:17.982
I wanna hear it real clear.

43:19.108 --> 43:21.734
Chuckie Loeder is not Aryan Army...

43:21.859 --> 43:24.277
and you guys aren't behind this,
is that right?

43:24.402 --> 43:27.904
If we were,
you wouldn't be standing here.

43:49.328 --> 43:51.329
We can go in now.

44:06.252 --> 44:07.670
Who did that to you?

44:07.795 --> 44:11.671
A soldier in the Aryan Army with
black tear-drops painted on his face.

44:11.713 --> 44:14.965
Painted? That wasn't
an Aryan soldier.

44:15.090 --> 44:18.591
Why would a guy do that?
Paint black teardrops on his face?

44:18.633 --> 44:21.634
I guess he wanted you to think
he was somebody he wasn't.

44:21.718 --> 44:24.886
- Why?
- Maybe because someone's afraid.

44:25.886 --> 44:28.262
- Afraid of what?
- I don't know.

44:28.387 --> 44:31.180
- The truth, maybe.
- The truth about what?

44:31.264 --> 44:34.432
About Chinatown.
What went down.

44:34.474 --> 44:37.267
What went down?
What happened in Chinatown?

44:37.433 --> 44:40.893
- You tell me.
- No, you tell me. Tell me.

44:41.018 --> 44:43.144
How could I tell you
what I don't know?

44:43.269 --> 44:45.270
You can't, so tell me what you do know.
Come on, say it.

44:45.312 --> 44:46.813
I don't know shit, man.

44:46.854 --> 44:49.647
Quit lying!

44:49.814 --> 44:54.608
I know that you're innocent,
even if you've forgotten.

44:57.859 --> 44:59.693
The D A's talking a deal.

44:59.860 --> 45:02.445
A little negotiating, I can get you
out of here in five years.

45:02.611 --> 45:04.696
- Five years?
- Maybe.

45:04.737 --> 45:07.655
With a little luck.
We take the deal, that's it.

45:07.739 --> 45:09.740
I don't find the guy
who did this to me.

45:09.865 --> 45:11.866
I don't go after the fuck
who put him up to it...

45:11.866 --> 45:14.284
the fuck who did the crime
and let you do the time.

45:14.450 --> 45:16.409
We take this deal, we walk away...

45:16.493 --> 45:18.494
never find out
what happened in Chinatown.

45:18.661 --> 45:22.912
Never get a shot at nailing
some guilty bastard's balls to the wall.

45:24.038 --> 45:25.080
No.

45:25.205 --> 45:29.207
"No" what?
I gotta hear you say it.

45:31.208 --> 45:33.292
Fuck the D A's deal.

45:56.511 --> 45:58.762
Jimmy Chin crossed north on Pell.

46:01.180 --> 46:03.890
At the last instant,
he must have sensed something...

46:05.098 --> 46:09.684
because he turned
and he was shot dead, right here.

46:13.686 --> 46:16.687
Laura Gayley stood
where you're standing right now.

46:16.687 --> 46:20.189
There was no telephone booth,
bus stop or stop sign in the way.

46:20.230 --> 46:22.815
Christ, she had a perfect view
of the killer's face.

46:22.815 --> 46:24.941
But she couldn't have, could she?

46:25.024 --> 46:27.025
Because she thinks she saw Shu.

46:27.067 --> 46:29.360
We know now she didn't see Shu.

46:29.526 --> 46:33.236
I'm stalking you.
I'm right behind you.

46:33.278 --> 46:37.363
There's a rage in the air. You can feel
the rage, like an electrical charge.

46:37.488 --> 46:39.864
You turn.
Time contracts...

46:39.864 --> 46:43.241
space explodes,
perceptions can't be trusted.

46:43.324 --> 46:44.992
As I pull out a loaded gun and...

46:45.659 --> 46:47.826
The guys in the field
will try to bullshit you...

46:47.910 --> 46:50.536
that comparison microscopy
is an exact science.

46:50.578 --> 46:53.787
Powder residue, grease stains,
skin fragments.

46:53.871 --> 46:56.622
It's all subject to interpretation.
You know what I'm saying?

46:56.705 --> 46:58.581
- Not exactly.
- I'm saying...

46:58.665 --> 47:00.666
we need to finesse a little,
we'll finesse.

47:00.707 --> 47:03.459
I told you, we don't need
to finesse this one.

47:03.500 --> 47:07.544
That's Shu's gun. Shu didn't
commit the crime. No finessing.

47:07.669 --> 47:10.712
Jesus! Jump back.

47:10.754 --> 47:13.505
You wanna hang out? I'll have something
preliminary in about an hour.

47:15.839 --> 47:19.049
My associate will wait. I got
some good news of my own to deliver.

47:29.846 --> 47:32.639
Excuse me.
Edward J. Dodd to see Mr Reynard.

47:32.680 --> 47:34.640
Could you wait
just a moment, please?

47:34.640 --> 47:37.432
Uh, yes, I'm sorry,
but it's a matter of policy...

47:37.474 --> 47:39.725
that Mr Reynard not attend
any political fund-raisers.

47:42.393 --> 47:45.186
Yes. Well, thank you.

47:49.480 --> 47:52.273
- Is he expecting you?
- This'll only take a minute.

47:52.314 --> 47:55.691
Well, I'm sorry. He's running
about an hour behind schedule.

47:55.691 --> 48:00.193
Just tell him Mr Dodd and Mr Kim
plan to proceed with trial.

48:08.613 --> 48:10.614
Did my girl
hear your message correctly?

48:10.781 --> 48:13.491
I guess so, or you wouldn't
be standing there. Am I right?

48:15.283 --> 48:17.659
Why did I think
I could deal reasonably...

48:17.659 --> 48:20.661
with a man who defends
coke pushers for free?

48:20.702 --> 48:23.078
Coke pushers pay cash.

48:23.162 --> 48:25.746
That subsidizes the pot
possession cases. They're free.

48:25.913 --> 48:29.873
But now you've strayed from
your area of expertise... dope...

48:29.915 --> 48:32.499
into street assassins.

48:32.624 --> 48:34.667
A subject of which
you are dangerously ignorant.

48:34.750 --> 48:37.001
Yeah, but I'm a quick study.

48:37.043 --> 48:40.044
I'll see your assistant D A,
Rabin, in court.

48:40.211 --> 48:41.420
No, Mr Dodd.

48:42.796 --> 48:45.047
You'll see me in court.

48:45.088 --> 48:47.006
I'm prosecuting this case.

48:48.465 --> 48:51.800
Why am I surprised? Colombians,
Koreans. What's the difference?

48:51.842 --> 48:54.343
You've built your career on putting
non-Whites behind bars, haven't you?

48:54.384 --> 48:57.969
I'll prosecute anyone
who fucks up.

48:58.094 --> 49:00.887
And if that makes me look racist...

49:01.012 --> 49:03.347
it's a trade-off
that I'll live with, Ed.

49:03.430 --> 49:07.307
That's big of you, Bob.

49:07.432 --> 49:09.350
See you in court.

49:14.102 --> 49:17.103
You should've taken the deal.

49:19.438 --> 49:21.230
You're probably right.

49:25.524 --> 49:27.400
Thanks.

49:27.483 --> 49:30.568
That was the ballistics guy, Howard.

49:30.568 --> 49:33.569
His tests showed that Shu's gun
fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.

49:33.694 --> 49:36.195
Well, Howard's
a fuckin' burn-out case.

49:36.279 --> 49:38.821
I wouldn't put him on the stand anyway.
Get more names from Billy.

49:38.863 --> 49:42.323
There's a sociology professor
at Columbia University.

49:42.365 --> 49:46.075
- He's an expert on street gangs.
- I talked to him.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.909
Apparently, doing a hit was the way
to get into the Pell Street Dragons.

49:49.076 --> 49:50.577
- Shit.
- There goes your theory...

49:50.660 --> 49:53.036
about them fingering Shu
instead of the trigger man.

49:53.078 --> 49:56.329
I like that theory. And since I'm not
putting Professor Twerp on the stand...

49:57.499 --> 49:59.750
and since I don't have another theory,
I'm gonna stick with it.

49:59.792 --> 50:03.918
I wouldn't need a goddam theory if you
could find that son of a bitch Loeder.

50:04.002 --> 50:08.504
I have phoned every art supply wholesale
and retailer in a 100-mile radius.

50:08.587 --> 50:11.714
- No one has heard of Chuckie Loeder.
- Here's a news flash.

50:11.755 --> 50:13.798
Maybe he's not calling himself
Chuckie Loeder these days.

50:13.923 --> 50:15.882
Maybe he's got an alias.
Biff Loeder.

50:16.049 --> 50:18.634
Can you guys just stop being
the prophets of doom?

50:18.759 --> 50:21.593
Every time I ask a question I get
an answer, but it's the wrong answer.

50:21.760 --> 50:24.761
You're on the bus or you're off the bus.
I can do this shit myself.

50:24.803 --> 50:26.429
That's not fair.

50:26.554 --> 50:30.055
We're all committed to the case.
We all believe it's a good fight.

50:34.141 --> 50:36.058
A good fight?

50:37.976 --> 50:40.519
You think I'm going into court
to make a fucking statement?

50:40.644 --> 50:44.312
You think Shu gives a shit
if we go down, but go down nobly?

50:44.395 --> 50:47.563
This is a man looking at
40 years of hard time!

50:47.688 --> 50:51.940
He could've had a deal and been out
in five, but he bet it all on me!

50:51.982 --> 50:55.025
Don't give me that liberal,
yuppie bullshit about a good fight.

50:55.067 --> 50:57.443
This isn't fucking Yale.

50:57.485 --> 50:59.736
A good fight is one you win!

51:04.029 --> 51:07.239
So you wanna bail out now, Eddie?
The door's over there.

51:11.908 --> 51:14.534
Kitty and I have work to do.
We're gonna be in court tomorrow.

51:30.667 --> 51:33.710
In the matter of
the People versus Shu Kai Kim...

51:33.793 --> 51:36.503
the Honourable Justice
Marcus Quealy presiding.

51:36.669 --> 51:38.212
All rise.

51:49.050 --> 51:51.051
Where's Eddie?

51:51.093 --> 51:54.052
He'll be here.

52:17.480 --> 52:21.773
You will hear the classic tale
of the immigrant in New York.

52:23.024 --> 52:26.776
It's the tale of a young Sicilian
in Little Italy...

52:26.942 --> 52:31.069
who slits a merchant's throat
as an entree into the Mafia.

52:31.194 --> 52:34.821
Or the Russian Jew
who reaches Brooklyn...

52:34.988 --> 52:38.739
and bludgeons a witness on behalf
of Murder, Incorporated.

52:38.823 --> 52:43.658
Shu Kai Kim is a part
of that ugly tradition.

52:45.409 --> 52:47.827
A stranger...

52:47.869 --> 52:50.620
Iooking for his place
in a new world...

52:50.703 --> 52:54.705
would turn the American dream...

52:54.747 --> 52:57.123
into an American nightmare.

52:59.999 --> 53:02.959
Why did Mr Kim...

53:03.042 --> 53:06.544
fire a bullet through the brain
of Jimmy Chin...

53:06.711 --> 53:08.753
a boy he never even knew?

53:13.130 --> 53:16.006
To get into a gang.

53:16.006 --> 53:19.341
Eight years ago,
gang war raged in Chinatown.

53:20.800 --> 53:23.051
No one felt safe.

53:23.135 --> 53:26.053
Tourism was down.

53:26.094 --> 53:29.471
Local businessmen pleaded
with the mayor.

53:29.596 --> 53:32.347
The mayor pressured
the police commissioner.

53:32.556 --> 53:34.890
And the police commissioner
told his men...

53:35.057 --> 53:40.184
"This time, arrest somebody."

53:42.602 --> 53:44.436
But whom?

53:44.603 --> 53:46.937
Well...

53:46.979 --> 53:49.939
the outsider, of course.

53:50.022 --> 53:52.523
The stranger.

53:52.648 --> 53:55.066
The immigrant.

53:55.233 --> 53:58.026
So what that he's not in a gang?

53:58.192 --> 54:00.485
So what that he's not even Chinese?

54:00.569 --> 54:03.487
I mean, who can tell
one Asian face from the next?

54:03.612 --> 54:07.572
So what that he didn't even
commit the crime?

54:07.655 --> 54:10.740
"This time, arrest somebody.

54:15.075 --> 54:17.993
Anybody."

54:19.244 --> 54:22.495
And so, Detective Montell, having
brought in Mr Kim for booking...

54:22.537 --> 54:26.122
you arranged for a line-up
with six other Asian males.

54:26.247 --> 54:27.748
That's right.

54:27.789 --> 54:30.332
<i>We brought in
six other Asian males...</i>

54:30.499 --> 54:33.000
<i>of the same approximate age...</i>

54:33.125 --> 54:36.085
<i>and had the eyewitnesses
view them from every angle.</i>

54:39.045 --> 54:42.088
And the results of that lineup?

54:42.129 --> 54:45.339
All the eyewitnesses picked Kim.

54:45.381 --> 54:47.715
But isn't it true
the six other Asian males...

54:47.882 --> 54:50.758
were of the classic
Mongoloid type...

54:50.925 --> 54:54.677
whereas Shu Kai Kim has the distinctive
facial bone structure of a Korean?

54:54.718 --> 54:58.012
Objection. The witness is not
an expert in racial classification.

54:58.178 --> 55:00.221
Sustained.

55:02.263 --> 55:05.223
<i>This banner headline appeared
in the Daily News...</i>

55:05.265 --> 55:09.767
October 25, 1979,
one week before Jimmy Chin's murder.

55:09.809 --> 55:13.810
"Mayor Rips Police Commish.

55:13.852 --> 55:17.062
Fed Up With Chinatown Violence."

55:17.104 --> 55:21.856
You were aware of the pressure,
weren't you, Detective Montell?

55:22.023 --> 55:26.233
<i>I'm sorry, Mr Dodd,
but I read the Post.</i>

55:33.361 --> 55:35.779
Detective Sklaroff...

55:35.946 --> 55:38.238
exactly what information
led you to arrest my client...

55:38.405 --> 55:40.906
just two and a half hours
after the shooting took place?

55:42.032 --> 55:43.532
We had a description
of the suspect.

55:43.574 --> 55:48.034
A description. Asian, male,
18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes.

55:48.201 --> 55:49.744
- That kind of thing?
- Argumentative.

55:49.827 --> 55:51.203
Overruled.

55:51.244 --> 55:52.787
We had intelligence.

55:52.828 --> 55:55.871
You had...

55:55.996 --> 55:57.539
intelligence.

56:00.624 --> 56:03.625
We had information bearing
on Mr Kim's desire...

56:03.667 --> 56:05.876
to gain admission
into the Pell Street Dragons...

56:05.918 --> 56:07.919
by assassinating a member
of a rival gang.

56:08.044 --> 56:10.628
Didn't that information
come from the Dragons themselves?

56:10.670 --> 56:13.671
Didn't they, the Pell Street Dragons,
a Chinese gang...

56:13.838 --> 56:16.422
all but hand you Shu Kai Kim,
a Korean, a foreigner...

56:16.589 --> 56:19.132
Objection, Your Honour.
This isn't a cross-examination.

56:19.174 --> 56:23.467
It's Mr Dodd's opening statement again,
and again it's pure fabrication.

56:23.634 --> 56:24.843
- Didn't they?
- Sustained.

56:26.969 --> 56:29.137
Please continue, Detective Sklaroff.

56:30.471 --> 56:33.514
<i>We proceeded to the suspect's address
and discovered him there.</i>

56:37.265 --> 56:40.308
<i>While my partner restrained
and arrested Mr Kim...</i>

56:40.350 --> 56:43.852
<i>I made a thorough search
of the premises...</i>

56:46.811 --> 56:49.271
<i>and recovered a.38-calibre handgun.</i>

56:50.563 --> 56:54.065
Isn't it unusual for a man who committed
a murder to bring the weapon home?

56:54.148 --> 56:56.649
- Calls for speculation.
- Sustained.

56:56.691 --> 56:59.651
- Are you implying I planted a gun?
- We'll let the jury decide that.

56:59.692 --> 57:03.194
Kim's prints were all over it.
He admitted it was his gun!

57:03.319 --> 57:09.197
The witness' answer is non-responsive.
I ask you to strike it from the record.

57:09.363 --> 57:14.908
You opened this line of questioning.
The testimony will remain in the record.

57:17.492 --> 57:20.952
- No more questions.
- You may step down, Detective Sklaroff.

57:27.330 --> 57:31.082
- I am dying out there.
- It's okay, Eddie.

57:31.457 --> 57:34.875
The People call
retired detective Vincent Dennehy.

57:43.587 --> 57:46.172
A fucking wheelchair?

57:47.673 --> 57:52.925
Detective Dennehy, you were the first
officer to arrive at the murder scene?

57:52.967 --> 57:56.635
Yes, sir,
I was the first one there.

57:57.719 --> 58:00.512
<i>And what did you do then?</i>

58:00.679 --> 58:04.139
<i>I secured the scene,
rerouted traffic...</i>

58:04.222 --> 58:06.890
<i>and searched the area
for physical evidence.</i>

58:06.973 --> 58:10.308
<i>There was a lot of confusion
down there that night.</i>

58:11.767 --> 58:14.685
<i>After that, I questioned
all the eyewitnesses...</i>

58:14.810 --> 58:17.311
<i>who remained
at the murder site.</i>

58:19.396 --> 58:23.481
<i>At 10:30 p.m., I proceeded,
with the decedent's body...</i>

58:23.564 --> 58:25.815
<i>to the office
of the county coroner.</i>

58:28.191 --> 58:32.026
<i>I left the crime scene
about 10:30.</i>

58:33.402 --> 58:36.070
<i>Thank you.
No further questions.</i>

58:37.154 --> 58:41.072
Detective, you reached the morgue
and delivered Jimmy Chin's body when?

58:52.953 --> 58:54.828
11:30.

58:54.995 --> 58:58.497
You expect us to believe
that from ten...

59:04.208 --> 59:07.292
from 10:10 to 11:30
that you had the time...

59:08.084 --> 59:11.461
- You okay?
- I get this pain.

59:23.425 --> 59:25.926
No more questions.
That's all right.

59:28.135 --> 59:33.388
Mr Dodd has yet to successfully
challenge any testimony given so far.

59:33.429 --> 59:36.306
- A fucking wheelchair?
- I didn't put him in it; Reynard did.

59:36.431 --> 59:40.266
He had a spinal injury. All he needs
is a cane. It was in Kitty's report.

59:40.308 --> 59:43.434
I don't have the time to read
every single line in every report.

59:43.517 --> 59:46.352
I'm too busy getting my ass
pulverized in the courtroom.

59:46.477 --> 59:49.645
Meanwhile, my crackerjack investigator
cannot find the art supply store...

59:49.729 --> 59:51.104
where Chuckie Loeder works.

59:51.229 --> 59:53.230
I'd love to chat,
but I'm meeting a cop for drinks.

59:53.272 --> 59:57.232
He's bringing the Dragons'
1979 mug book.

59:57.274 --> 59:59.691
I need an expert witness
on the Dragons.

59:59.775 --> 01:00:02.068
Eddie, stick this up your ass.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.071
Tall order.

01:00:09.196 --> 01:00:13.406
- "Art's Supplies"
- "Everything for the plumber."

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:47.088
- Is Art around?
- Is he expecting you?

01:00:47.088 --> 01:00:49.298
Yes, he is.

01:00:49.381 --> 01:00:52.174
I'm Maraquilla Esparza,
Art's wife.

01:00:52.299 --> 01:00:55.467
- Maraquilla. That's a lovely name.
- Thank you.

01:00:55.467 --> 01:00:58.343
- He's probably back in the factory?
- You're not supposed to go in there.

01:00:58.343 --> 01:01:03.137
Yeah, I know, but we called and said
we wanted to talk about that PVC tubing.

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:06.722
- He just said to come back.
- We'll just be a minute.

01:01:11.516 --> 01:01:13.183
Excuse me.

01:01:13.225 --> 01:01:16.435
- Art Esparza. What can I do for you?
- Eddie Dodd. This is Roger Baron.

01:01:16.477 --> 01:01:19.853
- You can't come back here.
- We're lawyers, and we're renovating.

01:01:19.853 --> 01:01:23.522
- There's metal grinding, open flames.
- Roger, is this toilet me?

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:28.274
- Something high-tech. The Lowboy.
- Do you have a demo of one of those?

01:01:28.315 --> 01:01:30.441
We're not a showroom.

01:01:30.566 --> 01:01:35.610
Isn't it healthier to sit lower on
a toilet so you can get your knees up?

01:01:35.819 --> 01:01:38.112
Makes a smooth move.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:39.737
Where's your friend?

01:02:06.041 --> 01:02:09.251
Loeder!

01:02:14.628 --> 01:02:16.796
I just wanna talk to you!

01:02:33.304 --> 01:02:36.055
Move, man, move!

01:03:04.443 --> 01:03:06.944
- Damn it!
- Get him off of me!

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:12.947
- You all right?
- Damn it.

01:03:12.988 --> 01:03:16.740
It's all right, fellas. I got it.
It's cool. I'm sorry.

01:03:16.907 --> 01:03:21.576
Didn't I tell you not to come back here?
Come with me. Talk to me.

01:03:21.742 --> 01:03:24.577
Nice meetin' ya.

01:03:24.702 --> 01:03:26.453
I'm a lawyer.

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.121
That gives you the right to run wild
in my place of business?

01:03:29.246 --> 01:03:32.122
Every man here has done
hard prison time.

01:03:32.247 --> 01:03:34.707
These people need to know
I can protect them.

01:03:34.707 --> 01:03:37.291
What gives you a perfect understanding
of "these people"?

01:03:37.333 --> 01:03:38.875
Five years in Attica.

01:03:38.917 --> 01:03:41.126
In the joint I met
a lot of cons I trusted...

01:03:41.293 --> 01:03:43.169
but I never met
a lawyer I trusted.

01:03:43.294 --> 01:03:47.504
Art's Supplies is founded on trust.
It's for ex-cons, not lawyers.

01:03:47.629 --> 01:03:51.131
Chuckie Loeder is a material witness
in a murder trial.

01:03:51.173 --> 01:03:53.465
I need to get him on the stand.

01:03:53.507 --> 01:03:56.133
If you'd been straight with me,
I could have helped you...

01:03:56.258 --> 01:03:58.551
but now you probably
scared him off for good.

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.844
You're leaving now, aren't you?

01:04:03.053 --> 01:04:05.387
- You okay?
- Fine.

01:04:05.429 --> 01:04:09.097
I lost Chuckie and got a lecture from
the jailhouse saint of Long Island City.

01:04:09.181 --> 01:04:13.183
- Where the hell were you?
- 1050 Amsterdam Avenue.

01:04:13.224 --> 01:04:14.725
- What?
- Chuckie's address.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.435
I sneaked a peek
at the Rolodex.

01:04:17.476 --> 01:04:20.478
Sneaked a peek at the Rolodex,
Counsellor? Nice.

01:04:41.988 --> 01:04:44.822
Kitty, Chuckie Loeder's
most recent address...

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:48.282
just happens to be
a hole in the ground.

01:04:48.324 --> 01:04:52.117
When they demolish a residential hotel,
the city has to relocate the tenants.

01:04:52.242 --> 01:04:54.618
The Housing Authority
will have records of...

01:04:54.785 --> 01:04:58.412
You taught me that? So why am I
wasting my breath? Get on it.

01:07:04.136 --> 01:07:07.262
I guess you found him
after all, didn't you?

01:07:10.472 --> 01:07:12.807
He had no family.

01:07:12.932 --> 01:07:16.058
I have to ID him.

01:07:16.225 --> 01:07:18.142
I'm his family.

01:07:28.939 --> 01:07:33.983
So, you won't be able
to use him now, will you?

01:07:34.066 --> 01:07:36.067
Eddie, let's go.

01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:38.402
It's goddam tragic, ain't it?

01:07:38.485 --> 01:07:40.861
Get out of here, Dodd!

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:49.907
Chuckie Loeder was murdered.
It's simple.

01:07:49.949 --> 01:07:52.908
Chuckie Loeder OD'd.
He was a junkie.

01:07:53.033 --> 01:07:57.160
The coroner found
120 track marks on him.

01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:59.912
Isn't it possible Loeder
beat you up on his own...

01:07:59.953 --> 01:08:02.121
to get back in good
with the Aryans?

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:03.747
Wrong!

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:09.166
The last of the ballistics experts
says Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin.

01:08:09.249 --> 01:08:11.584
That's why I hate experts.

01:08:11.667 --> 01:08:14.793
We have to go to Reynard
and cut a deal.

01:08:14.877 --> 01:08:18.837
I'm gonna fall on my knees and whimper
before that stooge of the ruling class?

01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:21.587
- Right.
- This isn't about you, it's about Shu.

01:08:21.671 --> 01:08:24.423
- If we can plead him out...
- We plead out guilty people!

01:08:24.506 --> 01:08:27.091
- Shu is innocent.
- Only Shu and God know that.

01:08:27.131 --> 01:08:30.466
I know that! How? Because Reynard says
he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit!

01:08:30.591 --> 01:08:33.301
Look. That's not
the face of a killer.

01:08:34.219 --> 01:08:37.511
You're carrying that around
like it's a picture of your girlfriend.

01:08:37.595 --> 01:08:40.721
- Your heart'll break if this case folds.
- It's not gonna happen.

01:08:40.805 --> 01:08:43.765
Ballistics says it's Shu's gun.
All the facts...

01:08:43.807 --> 01:08:48.142
"All the facts."
I'm gonna put the facts on trial.

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:51.477
Without Loeder,
we don't have a single witness.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.687
Then go find me one.
There's Chinatown.

01:08:56.187 --> 01:09:00.564
That's weird. I always pictured
the morgue being way uptown.

01:09:00.648 --> 01:09:04.149
<i>And that is the fatal bullet
that was fired that night in Chinatown.</i>

01:09:04.233 --> 01:09:06.067
Yes, sir.

01:09:07.651 --> 01:09:10.152
According to your analysis...

01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:13.694
can this bullet be linked
to Mr Kim's weapon?

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:19.490
Given that every gun barrel leaves a
distinct mark on the bullet it fires...

01:09:19.615 --> 01:09:24.408
we must conclude that this bullet was
fired by Mr Kim's.38-calibre handgun.

01:09:24.492 --> 01:09:25.743
Thank you, sir.

01:09:25.951 --> 01:09:27.743
No more questions.

01:09:27.868 --> 01:09:31.578
Forensic ballistics...

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.996
is not really
an exact science, is it?

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.331
It most certainly is, Mr Dodd.

01:09:36.497 --> 01:09:38.832
Like tarot cards or astrology
or something?

01:09:38.915 --> 01:09:44.126
Tarot cards and astrology are not
sciences. Ballistics is a science.

01:09:44.209 --> 01:09:47.669
- But it has a 10-15% margin of error.
- Absolutely not.

01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:50.379
- No more than seven percent.
- Seven percent.

01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:53.464
Out of every hundred cases,
based on your testimony...

01:09:53.546 --> 01:09:56.006
seven innocent men go to prison.

01:09:56.132 --> 01:09:57.716
Is that the idea?

01:09:58.716 --> 01:10:02.509
- Objection.
- Sustained.

01:10:02.551 --> 01:10:05.261
Withdrawn.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.222
Miss Gayley, please tell us exactly
what you remember seeing that evening.

01:10:11.305 --> 01:10:16.766
I don't think I'll ever forget it.
I was walking east on Pell Street.

01:10:17.891 --> 01:10:20.143
<i>I had come from dinner
with friends...</i>

01:10:20.309 --> 01:10:22.769
<i>and I noticed a man
walk past me.</i>

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:29.438
<i>He was walking very fast, and his hand
was shoved inside his jacket.</i>

01:10:29.563 --> 01:10:31.898
<i>Something told me to turn.</i>

01:10:43.695 --> 01:10:46.738
The man whom you saw
murder Jimmy Chin...

01:10:46.738 --> 01:10:48.822
is he in this courtroom?

01:10:49.031 --> 01:10:52.241
That's him sitting over there.

01:10:52.241 --> 01:10:55.909
Let the record show that Miss Gayley
indicated Shu Kai Kim.

01:10:59.661 --> 01:11:02.120
Your witness, Mr Dodd.

01:11:08.706 --> 01:11:11.291
I looked at these photo
and diagrams.

01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:14.334
I visited the murder scene,
heard your testimony.

01:11:14.501 --> 01:11:18.503
I look at the distance between us now
and keep coming to the same conclusion.

01:11:18.544 --> 01:11:23.588
I hate to say this... I don't understand
how you could've seen the killer's gun.

01:11:23.755 --> 01:11:27.757
- Does Mr Dodd have a question?
- Yes. Did you see the gun?

01:11:27.799 --> 01:11:31.884
- Yes. I can describe it.
- Really?

01:11:31.925 --> 01:11:36.302
It was silver, with a stubby barrel.
Snub-nosed, I believe they call it.

01:11:36.344 --> 01:11:40.138
It was not an automatic.
It had one of those cylinders.

01:11:40.179 --> 01:11:42.930
After eight years,
how can you remember that?

01:11:43.056 --> 01:11:47.391
- I could see the hammer. It was cocked.
- How could you possibly remember this?

01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:51.643
- Because I never took my eyes off it.
- She never took her eyes off the gun.

01:11:51.726 --> 01:11:54.186
- Thank you.
- Not the entire time.

01:11:54.352 --> 01:11:56.437
No further questions.

01:11:56.478 --> 01:12:00.147
- Look, I would like to...
- No further questions. Thank you.

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:06.775
You may step down, Miss Gayley.

01:12:15.904 --> 01:12:19.656
Your Honour, we wish to call a witness
whose name is not on the witness list.

01:12:19.781 --> 01:12:22.407
- Objection. This is trial by ambush.
- We just discovered him.

01:12:22.532 --> 01:12:25.325
He occupies the cell adjacent
to the defendant at Sing Sing Prison.

01:12:25.367 --> 01:12:27.951
This case has nothing to do
with events at Sing Sing Prison.

01:12:28.118 --> 01:12:33.203
Your Honour, I assure you the witness
has information specific to this case.

01:12:33.245 --> 01:12:37.622
Mr Dodd, you will be granted time
to prepare your cross-examination.

01:12:37.706 --> 01:12:40.123
In the absence of substantial prejudice
to your client...

01:12:40.207 --> 01:12:42.791
I will permit
the witness to testify.

01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:44.334
With objection, Your Honour.

01:12:44.417 --> 01:12:47.085
- So noted.
- Thank you.

01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:51.587
As their final witness,
the People wish to call Richard Ortega.

01:12:54.588 --> 01:12:57.089
Who is Richard Ortega?

01:13:09.053 --> 01:13:12.638
Mr Ortega,
what is La Fraternidad?

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:16.974
A Cubano prison gang, basically.

01:13:18.182 --> 01:13:20.975
And its purpose?

01:13:21.142 --> 01:13:26.019
Fighting the Aryan Army
and the Black Avengers, basically.

01:13:26.144 --> 01:13:28.562
Fighting.

01:13:30.563 --> 01:13:32.481
For what?

01:13:32.564 --> 01:13:36.316
To live.
We protect our own.

01:13:38.608 --> 01:13:41.276
I understand.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:45.362
In the course of protecting your own,
is it often necessary to commit murder?

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:48.905
Objection. The witness is being
asked to incriminate himself.

01:13:48.905 --> 01:13:52.907
The witness has been granted immunity
from prosecution for criminal acts...

01:13:53.032 --> 01:13:54.949
he may disclose
on the stand today.

01:13:55.074 --> 01:13:58.826
You must answer the question,
Mr Ortega.

01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:04.495
Are members of La Fraternidad
ever called upon to commit murder?

01:14:04.662 --> 01:14:07.497
Yeah, sometimes.

01:14:07.622 --> 01:14:10.123
All right.

01:14:10.165 --> 01:14:12.666
Now...

01:14:12.749 --> 01:14:16.042
isn't Shu Kai Kim,
who is Asian...

01:14:16.167 --> 01:14:18.252
a member of La Fraternidad?

01:14:18.418 --> 01:14:21.962
- Objection. Irrelevant.
- Overruled. Answer the question.

01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:24.463
Yeah, Shu's a member.

01:14:25.505 --> 01:14:26.714
Why?

01:14:26.756 --> 01:14:30.466
Why was Shu Kai Kim
recruited by La Fraternidad?

01:14:30.507 --> 01:14:32.633
- I can't answer that.
- Your Honour...

01:14:32.842 --> 01:14:36.385
It's a secret matter within
the organization. I ain't no snitch.

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:40.053
Mr Ortega, you must answer
under threat of contempt.

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:44.805
Why was Mr Kim, an Asian,
recruited by a Cubano prison gang?

01:14:44.889 --> 01:14:47.765
- Fuck you.
- Mr Ortega.

01:14:47.807 --> 01:14:52.184
I can sentence you to more years
than you've already served.

01:14:52.226 --> 01:14:56.061
I repeat: Why was Mr Kim
recruited by La Fraternidad?

01:14:56.102 --> 01:14:57.978
- Chinatown.
- Chinatown?

01:14:59.229 --> 01:15:02.188
How do you know
what Mr Kim did in Chinatown?

01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:05.232
Did Shu Kai Kim tell members
of La Fraternidad...

01:15:05.315 --> 01:15:07.399
that he murdered Jimmy Chin?

01:15:07.441 --> 01:15:09.859
Man, they got me
all fucked up here!

01:15:10.025 --> 01:15:13.235
Did Mr Kim confess to you
that he killed Jimmy Chin?

01:15:13.319 --> 01:15:16.528
- He mentioned it!
- He mentioned it!

01:15:18.904 --> 01:15:22.031
Or did he, in fact,
boast about it...

01:15:22.073 --> 01:15:24.407
to any inmate who would listen?

01:15:25.324 --> 01:15:27.450
- Objection.
- Sustained.

01:15:28.951 --> 01:15:32.286
Withdrawn.
The People rest.

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:42.957
Mr Dodd, how much time will you
require to prepare your cross?

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:47.751
Your Honour, we move that
the witness' testimony be stricken.

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:50.502
He's obviously been manipulated
by the prosecution.

01:15:50.627 --> 01:15:53.795
Mr Baron, you are not
the attorney of record here.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.922
Mr Dodd,
do you wish to cross-examine?

01:15:58.006 --> 01:16:00.423
Ask for 72 hours, Eddie.

01:16:02.966 --> 01:16:06.718
Court is hereby adjourned
until 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:34.272
Listen to me. Eddie.

01:16:38.733 --> 01:16:41.025
Eddie, where are you going?

01:16:42.443 --> 01:16:45.486
Look, I heard Ortega
say that Shu confessed.

01:16:45.569 --> 01:16:47.945
I didn't see any evidence.

01:16:48.029 --> 01:16:51.405
We're gonna ask the judge
for a continuance of 48 hours...

01:16:51.489 --> 01:16:55.532
and we'll find an inmate who will
testify that Shu said he didn't do it!

01:16:55.532 --> 01:16:58.784
The guiltier he is,
the more he needs us.

01:16:58.825 --> 01:17:01.326
- You said that.
- Get lost.

01:17:25.504 --> 01:17:27.797
There was quite a bit
you didn't tell me.

01:17:27.922 --> 01:17:30.465
When I joined,
I took a oath of secrecy.

01:17:30.506 --> 01:17:32.591
I told you
what you needed to know.

01:17:32.757 --> 01:17:37.051
I didn't need to know you bragged about
killing Chin? What was that knifing?

01:17:37.134 --> 01:17:41.095
- Aryans cutting in on your crack trade?
- That was self-defence.

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:44.555
Jimmy Chin.
Was that self-defence too? Huh?

01:17:54.684 --> 01:18:00.437
I'm sorry, it's just that for a while
I thought there was this, like...

01:18:00.437 --> 01:18:05.898
You'll laugh, but I thought we were two
sorry assholes who needed each other...

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:08.482
who could help each other.

01:18:08.566 --> 01:18:11.775
- How could I help you?
- By trusting me.

01:18:11.859 --> 01:18:14.777
I got my face kicked in
because I trusted you.

01:18:14.943 --> 01:18:19.737
No expert would say it wasn't your gun
that killed Chin, but it didn't matter.

01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:23.072
I went up against the D A himself,
but I didn't care...

01:18:23.072 --> 01:18:26.115
because I trusted you,
because I believed in you...

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.284
because I thought
there was a bond between us.

01:18:30.284 --> 01:18:32.743
You're out there
and I'm in here.

01:18:32.827 --> 01:18:35.620
My bond, my trust...

01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:38.287
is with the guys in here
that cover my back.

01:18:39.455 --> 01:18:42.623
When you leave this place,
you go out to dinner...

01:18:42.623 --> 01:18:45.124
see a movie, get laid.

01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:48.959
I'm going back to my cell
and wait to die.

01:18:50.418 --> 01:18:52.169
So you tell me...

01:18:52.211 --> 01:18:54.753
where is our bond?

01:18:55.754 --> 01:19:01.006
For a while we had this dream
we were innocent.

01:19:01.131 --> 01:19:03.507
That was our bond.

01:19:05.883 --> 01:19:08.385
Then we woke up.

01:19:09.719 --> 01:19:13.304
- I want to hear everything.
- What do you mean, "everything"?

01:19:13.345 --> 01:19:17.555
The truth.
Tell me about Chinatown, Shu.

01:19:17.639 --> 01:19:19.473
Tell me the truth.

01:19:21.724 --> 01:19:23.850
Just tell me the truth!

01:19:49.862 --> 01:19:51.654
Are you sleeping?

01:19:58.908 --> 01:20:03.243
You know, I haven't gotten stoned once
since this trial started.

01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:07.120
Come on in. We'll talk in the morning.
In the meantime, you can get some sleep.

01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:09.288
I don't need sleep.

01:20:09.454 --> 01:20:13.414
- Do you believe in luck, Kitty?
- Luck.

01:20:13.456 --> 01:20:16.166
No. Why?

01:20:16.249 --> 01:20:19.584
'Cause after ten years
of defending nothing but scumbags...

01:20:19.751 --> 01:20:24.294
this kid, this Roger,
came along out of nowhere.

01:20:24.294 --> 01:20:28.421
Suddenly I find myself
fighting to free an innocent man.

01:20:30.506 --> 01:20:33.799
An innocent man, Kitty.

01:20:33.882 --> 01:20:38.468
You don't find too many of those
in my line of work.

01:20:38.509 --> 01:20:41.219
For a minute, I thought...

01:20:44.012 --> 01:20:46.513
the kid brought me luck.

01:20:48.681 --> 01:20:50.932
And it felt good.

01:20:51.015 --> 01:20:53.224
Oh, it felt good.

01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:56.851
Yeah, well, my minute is up.

01:20:58.268 --> 01:21:01.478
Come on, Eddie. A guilty client's
not the end of the world.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.813
Exactly.

01:21:03.854 --> 01:21:05.855
It's a new beginning.

01:21:06.022 --> 01:21:08.565
I'm going back
to defending scumbags.

01:21:08.606 --> 01:21:11.274
Not just dope peddlers any more.

01:21:11.316 --> 01:21:13.900
Porno merchants.
Child-molesters.

01:21:13.942 --> 01:21:16.068
Repeat drunk drivers.
I'll get 'em all off.

01:21:16.193 --> 01:21:19.778
Hit men. "Send Eddie Dodd
your contract killers."

01:21:20.904 --> 01:21:23.905
None of'em ever does time again.

01:21:23.905 --> 01:21:27.657
Eddie, just go home.
Get some sleep.

01:22:07.133 --> 01:22:11.218
- What do you want?
- Roger Baron. I work with Eddie Dodd.

01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:14.011
Why were you at Shu's trial
this afternoon?

01:22:14.136 --> 01:22:17.972
- What trial?
- I followed you from the courthouse.

01:22:18.055 --> 01:22:20.348
Listen, I knew Jimmy Chin.

01:22:20.348 --> 01:22:24.558
- You were concerned Shu would go free?
- That's right.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:28.601
Now, did you have Chuckie Loeder
try to scare Eddie off the case?

01:22:28.601 --> 01:22:32.228
- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
- He OD'd. He's dead.

01:22:33.354 --> 01:22:35.396
Art didn't tell you?

01:22:35.396 --> 01:22:37.522
- Look, mister...
- Roger.

01:22:37.564 --> 01:22:41.149
You mustn't tell Art
you saw me at the trial.

01:22:41.274 --> 01:22:44.400
You had a right to be there, especially
if you and Jimmy Chin were friends.

01:22:44.567 --> 01:22:46.610
Friends?

01:22:46.651 --> 01:22:50.611
Oh, my God.
You don't know anything.

01:23:25.753 --> 01:23:29.171
Roger, go home.
Take a job on Wall Street.

01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:31.505
- It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit.
- Yeah, right.

01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:35.257
Eddie, Art Esparza's wife
and Jimmy Chin were lovers.

01:23:35.299 --> 01:23:37.425
She just about told me.

01:23:37.466 --> 01:23:40.926
Great. You phoned Art Esparza's wife?
What, are you nuts?

01:23:41.051 --> 01:23:43.177
No, I followed her
from the courthouse.

01:23:47.262 --> 01:23:49.847
Esparza's wife
was at Shu's trial?

01:23:49.972 --> 01:23:52.640
Yeah, and she was scared
I'd tell Art.

01:23:56.308 --> 01:23:58.434
Art Esparza.

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:02.228
What do we know about
that self-righteous son of a bitch?

01:24:15.901 --> 01:24:18.985
- Dodd, you got 15 minutes.
- Right.

01:24:21.236 --> 01:24:23.946
Check this out.
The man's a prince.

01:24:24.071 --> 01:24:27.906
"Queens businessman honoured for
his efforts to employ ex-convicts."

01:24:28.073 --> 01:24:32.408
Security clearance for Esparza to go
into jails for parole board hearings.

01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:35.368
Wonderful work this man does.

01:24:35.451 --> 01:24:40.495
Skipping two years back... his real work.
He's being watched by Narco.

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:43.872
"Suspected of using his warehouse
as drug drop.

01:24:43.997 --> 01:24:46.164
Surveillance terminated."

01:24:49.416 --> 01:24:51.417
Going back four years.

01:24:51.459 --> 01:24:56.461
"Arthur Esparza charged with assault.
Dismissed."

01:24:56.544 --> 01:25:00.213
"Accessory to extortion.
Dismissed."

01:25:00.254 --> 01:25:01.963
"Dismissed."

01:25:03.506 --> 01:25:06.090
You get the feeling
this prick is protected?

01:25:06.215 --> 01:25:08.425
I'm outta here.
You owe me one.

01:25:08.508 --> 01:25:10.300
"Dismissed."

01:25:11.801 --> 01:25:14.469
"Dismissed for lack of evidence."

01:25:27.892 --> 01:25:29.684
Shit.

01:25:35.395 --> 01:25:37.229
Jesus Christ.

01:25:37.313 --> 01:25:38.897
What?

01:25:40.481 --> 01:25:43.732
I've seen this picture before.

01:25:54.029 --> 01:25:58.531
No wonder the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
They could've been brothers.

01:25:58.573 --> 01:26:02.116
Esparza killed Jimmy Chin.

01:26:05.076 --> 01:26:07.535
The killer wasn't Chinese.
Cecil Skell was right!

01:26:07.618 --> 01:26:11.787
Everybody else was wrong.
The one fucking lunatic was right.

01:26:11.912 --> 01:26:13.288
Come on.

01:26:13.413 --> 01:26:15.997
Does this mean
the phone company killed Kennedy?

01:26:18.207 --> 01:26:21.291
Shu's gun is an absolute match.
How could it be?

01:26:21.333 --> 01:26:23.667
Not here, Roger.

01:26:23.751 --> 01:26:25.668
Jesus!

01:26:29.670 --> 01:26:33.547
At least we'd already be
at the morgue. Goddam.

01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:36.924
We'll make
a citizen's arrest of Esparza.

01:26:37.049 --> 01:26:40.508
But we'll need some backup. Who's the
meanest motherfucker you ever got off?

01:26:40.592 --> 01:26:43.927
Just give me a name.
Any client who owns a Magnum.

01:26:55.099 --> 01:26:57.433
The broken-down detective
in the wheelchair.

01:26:57.516 --> 01:26:58.892
Dennehy.

01:26:58.934 --> 01:27:02.477
He said he left Chinatown
with Jimmy Chin's body at 10:30.

01:27:02.477 --> 01:27:06.479
And didn't reach the morgue for an hour.
That's why I thought it was way uptown.

01:27:06.562 --> 01:27:09.313
- Fill in for me in court today.
- What?

01:27:09.438 --> 01:27:11.773
I need you in court.

01:27:29.906 --> 01:27:33.366
- Who the hell is it?
- Come on, open up.

01:27:33.366 --> 01:27:35.951
Sorry to bother you
at this hour.

01:27:35.951 --> 01:27:38.118
I'm Edward J. Dodd.
Are you Mrs Dennehy?

01:27:38.202 --> 01:27:40.328
I'm Ms. Dennehy,
Vin's sister.

01:27:40.369 --> 01:27:44.454
- I have to talk to your brother.
- No! You gotta be crazy at this hour!

01:27:44.538 --> 01:27:47.372
Can you step back from the door,
please?

01:27:47.539 --> 01:27:48.915
Thank you.

01:27:50.290 --> 01:27:52.208
- Where are you going?
- Stay.

01:28:12.009 --> 01:28:13.926
Dennehy.

01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:17.053
Do I know you?

01:28:17.219 --> 01:28:19.929
I'm Eddie Dodd.
I cross-examined you.

01:28:20.012 --> 01:28:23.014
But not very well.

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:25.557
What did you do
with Jimmy Chin's body?

01:28:25.598 --> 01:28:27.849
Please, I need to sleep.

01:28:28.016 --> 01:28:31.810
What did you do
with Jimmy Chin's body?

01:28:31.893 --> 01:28:35.353
- I brought it to the coroner.
- An hour after you picked it up.

01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:37.104
Yeah, an hour later.

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:40.272
From Chinatown, which is right
down the street from the morgue?

01:28:40.355 --> 01:28:42.940
What did you do
with Jimmy Chin's body?

01:28:43.106 --> 01:28:46.233
You're fishing.
You don't know shit.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.234
I know about Art Esparza.

01:28:49.276 --> 01:28:52.194
- It wasn't Vin's idea.
- Connie.

01:28:52.236 --> 01:28:56.446
- Go to bed. This is official business.
- You were pressured. Tell the man.

01:29:00.323 --> 01:29:03.782
- Go back to bed.
- Come on, talk to me.

01:29:03.949 --> 01:29:05.742
Come on.

01:29:09.327 --> 01:29:13.620
We thought it would work
if it was a through-and-through.

01:29:13.745 --> 01:29:15.913
What's a "through-and-through"?

01:29:16.038 --> 01:29:18.623
I got this chronic pain.

01:29:18.789 --> 01:29:21.791
What is a "through-and-through"?

01:29:21.874 --> 01:29:26.460
You know, eight years I been waitin'
for some genius to notice...

01:29:26.626 --> 01:29:31.087
it took me an hour
to drive seven blocks.

01:29:36.172 --> 01:29:39.924
<i>I drove Chin's body
to the Manhattan Bridge.</i>

01:29:39.966 --> 01:29:42.967
<i>Under the bridge.</i>

01:29:43.009 --> 01:29:48.011
<i>Montell and Sklaroff were already there
with Shu Kai Kim's gun.</i>

01:29:50.262 --> 01:29:53.180
<i>We only had three hours.</i>

01:29:53.264 --> 01:29:58.224
<i>After that, with the body
cooling and clotting...</i>

01:29:58.266 --> 01:30:01.642
<i>it wouldn't look right
to the pathologist.</i>

01:30:03.393 --> 01:30:10.396
<i>Chin had been hit once in the forehead
by Esparza's.32.</i>

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:13.815
<i>The bullet exited clean.
That's a through-and-through.</i>

01:30:15.899 --> 01:30:19.150
<i>So, all Sklaroff
had to worry about was...</i>

01:30:21.026 --> 01:30:24.153
<i>aiming Kim's.38
at the same angle.</i>

01:30:35.533 --> 01:30:39.243
We pulled the bullet
out of the mattress...

01:30:40.619 --> 01:30:42.745
and that was it.

01:30:42.786 --> 01:30:44.745
An airtight case.

01:30:44.787 --> 01:30:48.831
Why? All this
to protect Art Esparza? Why?

01:30:50.373 --> 01:30:53.541
That nasty little bastard!

01:30:53.625 --> 01:30:57.209
He steps in shit,
we gotta lick his boots clean.

01:31:01.795 --> 01:31:03.337
He was your snitch.

01:31:03.462 --> 01:31:05.880
The Colombian connection.

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.964
Colombian?

01:31:08.131 --> 01:31:11.716
Three years
of ball-busting detective work.

01:31:13.008 --> 01:31:16.427
We put a lot of bad guys in jail.

01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:18.928
And one good guy.

01:31:22.471 --> 01:31:27.056
Demerol? What is your problem, man?
You wanna die? Huh?

01:31:27.098 --> 01:31:29.516
I am dead.
We're both dead.

01:31:29.683 --> 01:31:33.018
Nobody dies
until I hear the truth.

01:31:33.101 --> 01:31:36.477
Who put the frame on Shu?

01:31:39.145 --> 01:31:41.480
Stay awake, Dennehy.

01:31:42.188 --> 01:31:44.189
Shit.

01:31:44.314 --> 01:31:48.316
Come on, talk to me, man.
I didn't say snort. I said talk.

01:31:48.358 --> 01:31:51.026
- I need you to live.
- Where are we going?

01:31:51.193 --> 01:31:53.402
We're going to the hospital.

01:31:55.028 --> 01:31:56.862
Oh, shit.

01:31:58.071 --> 01:32:00.989
Why did you have to come here,
you hippie-dippie fuck?

01:32:01.072 --> 01:32:04.115
Vinnie's really sick.
He needs a hospital.

01:32:04.115 --> 01:32:06.616
That makes two of you.

01:32:08.117 --> 01:32:09.826
Move it!

01:32:19.664 --> 01:32:22.082
- Stand up!
- Goddam it, Art!

01:32:23.457 --> 01:32:25.708
- Get back in the car!
- Just give me...

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:28.293
Get back in the fucking car!

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:32.045
I'm warning you, man!

01:32:32.086 --> 01:32:34.462
What did you tell the lawyer?

01:32:35.713 --> 01:32:38.881
- Lou?
- I'm right here, Vin.

01:32:38.923 --> 01:32:40.674
So's Dave.

01:32:40.715 --> 01:32:44.300
But we need to know
what you told the lawyer.

01:32:47.010 --> 01:32:49.136
I came clean.

01:32:59.349 --> 01:33:01.558
Vinnie told him everything.

01:33:01.642 --> 01:33:06.310
- You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit.
- Let's snuff this low-life.

01:33:06.477 --> 01:33:10.020
The fact you popped Jimmy Chin in public
proves it wasn't premeditated.

01:33:10.104 --> 01:33:11.938
The jury will sympathize.

01:33:12.021 --> 01:33:15.440
- Dude was banging your wife, right?
- Shut your... Get off me!

01:33:15.565 --> 01:33:17.399
Cool it!

01:33:17.524 --> 01:33:20.150
- You're dead.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

01:33:20.317 --> 01:33:23.360
Kill me in the middle of a trial.
Wouldn't be clean, though, like Chuckie.

01:33:23.443 --> 01:33:26.611
What, did you treat him
to a match head of pure smack?

01:33:26.653 --> 01:33:30.196
- That's right. I'm a generous guy.
- Who'd you waste now, Art?

01:33:30.988 --> 01:33:36.157
- Goddam you.
- Do it, Lou, so we can go home.

01:33:36.199 --> 01:33:38.325
Still letting your snitch
run you?

01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:39.992
Lou, we have to.

01:33:41.201 --> 01:33:44.328
Waste him.
The man will take care of it.

01:33:44.453 --> 01:33:47.663
- He's right.
- Come on.

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:50.539
- Come on.
- Do it, you pussy!

01:33:51.873 --> 01:33:54.082
All right,
I'll blow the scumbag away.

01:34:04.545 --> 01:34:07.046
I should've done that
eight years ago.

01:34:20.261 --> 01:34:21.678
You see that?

01:34:24.388 --> 01:34:27.139
You wanna be like that? Huh?

01:34:28.473 --> 01:34:30.766
You gonna keep
your mouth shut?

01:34:30.891 --> 01:34:34.434
- We can't trust him.
- Are you gonna keep quiet?

01:34:37.185 --> 01:34:40.353
- I can't.
- Shoot him, for Christ's sake!

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.938
I can't do it, Lou.

01:34:46.898 --> 01:34:50.150
That's the motherfucker
that shot Jimmy Chin!

01:34:51.150 --> 01:34:52.859
It's justice!

01:34:52.943 --> 01:34:56.861
I got a client in prison eight years.
Where's the justice in that?

01:34:58.737 --> 01:35:01.697
My guy's gotta walk.

01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:05.031
I can't keep my mouth shut.
I can't.

01:35:06.907 --> 01:35:08.158
It's over.

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:12.035
Your lies...

01:35:12.076 --> 01:35:16.036
my lies, all the bullshit.

01:35:16.161 --> 01:35:17.871
It's enough.

01:35:20.038 --> 01:35:22.456
You sorry bastard.

01:35:24.332 --> 01:35:26.666
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:35:36.796 --> 01:35:38.797
I gotta go now.

01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:42.132
I gotta be in court.

01:35:48.468 --> 01:35:50.344
Freeze!

01:35:58.014 --> 01:35:59.640
Freeze!

01:36:01.807 --> 01:36:03.600
Where is Mr Dodd?

01:36:03.683 --> 01:36:06.726
Your Honour, if I may.

01:36:09.436 --> 01:36:13.146
I don't know where Mr Dodd is,
but if he does not appear in due time...

01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:16.773
I am ready to proceed
on Mr Kim's behalf.

01:36:16.898 --> 01:36:20.983
- I don't find this amusing, Mr Baron.
- Neither do I, Your Honour.

01:36:23.609 --> 01:36:25.943
Good morning, Mr Dodd.

01:36:25.943 --> 01:36:30.529
You think you might be up to
presenting your case this morning?

01:36:30.571 --> 01:36:33.864
You looked pretty good up there.

01:36:33.989 --> 01:36:35.781
Your Honour...

01:36:37.949 --> 01:36:41.826
I suppose I could find
some inmate at Sing Sing...

01:36:41.909 --> 01:36:43.910
who would say that Shu boasted...

01:36:44.118 --> 01:36:46.411
about killing Jimmy Chin
to survive in prison...

01:36:46.578 --> 01:36:49.121
though he didn't really do it.

01:36:49.162 --> 01:36:51.122
But would we be any closer
to understanding...

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:54.040
what really happened
in Chinatown eight years ago?

01:36:54.165 --> 01:36:55.624
You have no witnesses?

01:36:55.874 --> 01:36:59.209
If it please the court,
the defence calls...

01:36:59.334 --> 01:37:00.834
Mr Robert Reynard.

01:37:05.170 --> 01:37:08.421
I would ask opposing counsel
to make an offer of proof...

01:37:08.505 --> 01:37:11.589
that this is anything more
than a desperate tactic.

01:37:11.673 --> 01:37:13.924
Will you both
approach the bench, please?

01:37:18.634 --> 01:37:21.094
As a prominent assistant D A
at the time...

01:37:21.177 --> 01:37:25.387
he had knowledge of external pressures
that led to my client's arrest.

01:37:25.471 --> 01:37:28.889
More nonsense about pressure
from the mayor's office.

01:37:28.931 --> 01:37:32.307
A man's freedom is at stake here.

01:37:32.391 --> 01:37:36.726
I urge you to give me
the benefit of the doubt. Please.

01:37:38.977 --> 01:37:42.479
As the defence has
no other witnesses...

01:37:42.604 --> 01:37:44.896
I'm inclined to permit this,
Mr Reynard.

01:37:45.063 --> 01:37:47.481
It's a last-ditch ploy,
Your Honour.

01:37:47.523 --> 01:37:50.149
The defence hopes
my presence on the stand...

01:37:50.232 --> 01:37:52.567
will create the opportunity
for a mistrial.

01:37:54.067 --> 01:37:56.568
The defence is mistaken.

01:37:58.486 --> 01:38:00.153
Thank you, Your Honour.

01:38:01.779 --> 01:38:06.865
Let's discuss your involvement
in the original Shu Kai Kim case.

01:38:07.031 --> 01:38:09.283
My "involvement"
was marginal, at best.

01:38:09.366 --> 01:38:11.867
I wasn't assigned
the original Kim case.

01:38:11.909 --> 01:38:16.036
Right. Weren't you busy investigating a
Colombian crime syndicate at that time?

01:38:16.119 --> 01:38:17.328
Yes, Mr Dodd.

01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:21.621
That case, with its attendant publicity,
led you into the office you now hold.

01:38:21.705 --> 01:38:24.956
If I were sitting where I normally sit,
I'd say, "Calls for speculation."

01:38:25.123 --> 01:38:27.499
But you aren't sitting
where you normally sit.

01:38:27.624 --> 01:38:32.710
So, did you have a hands-on role,
or did you just supervise from on high?

01:38:33.794 --> 01:38:36.045
I was personally involved...

01:38:36.170 --> 01:38:39.296
with all phases and principals
of the investigation.

01:38:39.338 --> 01:38:41.756
- Your Honour, I see no connection...
- And who...

01:38:41.839 --> 01:38:45.716
were the three detectives who assisted
you in the Colombian case, please?

01:38:47.884 --> 01:38:51.343
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Dennehy
and Dave Montell.

01:38:51.385 --> 01:38:54.595
The same three detectives
in the Shu Kai Kim case.

01:38:54.637 --> 01:38:58.847
That's right, Mr Dodd. In those days
they often worked as a team.

01:38:59.639 --> 01:39:01.015
Who was Arturo Esparza?

01:39:02.807 --> 01:39:04.891
I don't know that name.

01:39:04.933 --> 01:39:09.018
You just said you were involved with
all principals of the investigation.

01:39:09.018 --> 01:39:13.020
But I can't be expected to remember the
name of every informant 8 years later.

01:39:14.146 --> 01:39:17.272
I didn't say he was an informant,
did I?

01:39:17.314 --> 01:39:22.149
But since you mentioned it, he was your
key informant, your primary informant.

01:39:22.233 --> 01:39:25.276
Without him, you had no investigation
in the Colombian case, did you?

01:39:25.317 --> 01:39:27.360
Showboating can cost lives.

01:39:27.485 --> 01:39:30.070
You're trespassing
into witness protection.

01:39:30.195 --> 01:39:31.695
Witness protection.

01:39:31.737 --> 01:39:35.322
That's when the State grants favourable
treatment in exchange for information.

01:39:35.364 --> 01:39:37.323
Like yesterday with Mr Ortega.

01:39:37.365 --> 01:39:41.950
A necessary compromise to serve
a greater good. It's a trade-off.

01:39:42.158 --> 01:39:43.326
Trade-off?

01:39:44.368 --> 01:39:46.911
How far does it go, Mr Reynard?

01:39:47.077 --> 01:39:51.246
Protecting a key informant
by covering up a murder he's committed?

01:39:51.413 --> 01:39:53.747
Or does it go even further?

01:39:53.872 --> 01:39:57.124
I think you're a dangerous man,
Mr Dodd.

01:39:58.458 --> 01:40:00.792
I hope so, Mr Reynard.

01:40:03.793 --> 01:40:06.169
On the night
of November 2, 1979...

01:40:06.211 --> 01:40:08.212
the night Jimmy Chin
was murdered...

01:40:08.295 --> 01:40:12.464
didn't your key informant Art Esparza
phone you in a panic and say...

01:40:12.547 --> 01:40:15.090
"I just shot a man in Chinatown.
People saw me do it."

01:40:15.215 --> 01:40:17.800
- No.
- Yes! And what did you say?

01:40:17.883 --> 01:40:20.468
- Objection! Badgering!
- Sustained.

01:40:20.509 --> 01:40:24.511
Didn't you say, "Don't worry, we'll
make it look like a Chinatown gang hit"?

01:40:24.511 --> 01:40:27.929
- That is a slanderous accusation.
- Your team combed through mug books.

01:40:28.096 --> 01:40:30.180
Found a patsy. Framed him!

01:40:30.264 --> 01:40:32.265
The objection was sustained.

01:40:32.306 --> 01:40:34.516
We can't let Esparza's crime
spoil everything.

01:40:34.599 --> 01:40:36.725
That wouldn't serve
the greater good!

01:40:36.725 --> 01:40:40.894
Your Honour, Counsel is recklessly
exposing privileged information...

01:40:40.977 --> 01:40:43.270
from a classified case.

01:40:43.395 --> 01:40:47.230
That case has been over for years.
Art Esparza is dead.

01:40:50.481 --> 01:40:53.149
Can't my client go free now?

01:41:05.738 --> 01:41:10.032
Mr Dodd, this is an improper forum
for these allegations.

01:41:10.074 --> 01:41:13.367
I understand.
You had to protect your case.

01:41:13.492 --> 01:41:18.161
You made a lot of arrests.
You maybe even saved some lives.

01:41:26.164 --> 01:41:29.082
You make that sound trivial.

01:41:29.124 --> 01:41:31.125
Trivial?

01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:33.751
No, not trivial.

01:41:33.835 --> 01:41:37.670
Your Honour, my apologies. I withdraw
these questions for the record.

01:41:37.753 --> 01:41:40.129
But I must know one thing.

01:41:42.797 --> 01:41:45.757
How could you do it?

01:41:49.342 --> 01:41:51.968
It was a trade-off, Mr Dodd.

01:41:56.011 --> 01:41:58.179
I'd do it again.

01:42:04.849 --> 01:42:06.683
Your Honour...

01:42:08.559 --> 01:42:11.060
the defence rests.

01:43:03.167 --> 01:43:06.460
Looks like you've become
a symbol for your community.

01:43:09.045 --> 01:43:12.963
- Think I could get a ride with you guys?
- Go ahead, Shu.

01:43:13.047 --> 01:43:14.798
Be important.

01:43:28.554 --> 01:43:29.554
Thanks.

01:43:32.139 --> 01:43:35.599
Go on, get out of here.
Your mother's waiting for you.

01:44:11.490 --> 01:44:14.283
So what about you?

01:44:14.283 --> 01:44:16.784
Still thinking
about that job on Wall Street?

01:44:16.909 --> 01:44:19.077
What, now that things
are going well?

01:44:19.202 --> 01:44:22.037
Hope this doesn't mean
you're gonna ask for a raise.

01:44:22.162 --> 01:44:26.080
- Raise? I haven't even been paid yet.
- You haven't? Good. I was worried.

01:44:26.205 --> 01:44:29.623
All the publicity from this oughta
get us a decent bunch of clients.

01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:31.458
Decent? Roger.

01:44:31.541 --> 01:44:34.876
The most grievous injustices
in history...

01:44:34.876 --> 01:44:36.835
have been perpetrated
in the name of decency.

01:44:36.877 --> 01:44:38.378
Sorry I asked.

01:44:38.586 --> 01:44:41.671
This case shows we must support
the indecent, the indefensible...

01:44:41.837 --> 01:44:44.130
the wretched, the disreputable.

01:44:44.422 --> 01:44:47.632
