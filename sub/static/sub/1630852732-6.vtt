WEBVTT

00:11.845 --> 00:14.431
No, get… Get off!

00:14.514 --> 00:16.891
Brayden, what are you doing? Brayden!

00:30.321 --> 00:32.198
Hey, Brayden, looking for someone?

00:32.699 --> 00:34.117
How did you get in here?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.452
I remember the way.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.954
-You can't do that.
-Sometimes I make up a new power.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.249
No! Dion! This is my place!

00:43.209 --> 00:45.795
You can't come here
unless I bring you here!

00:50.675 --> 00:51.634
Dion!

00:54.137 --> 00:54.971
Dion!

00:58.141 --> 00:59.809
Brayden, is that you?

01:01.603 --> 01:02.896
Brayden?

01:02.979 --> 01:05.648
-I want my mama.
-We gotta get you out of here!

01:05.732 --> 01:06.649
Brayden?

01:06.733 --> 01:09.569
You're scared.
That's why Brayden's acting like this!

01:09.652 --> 01:12.072
-Let's get you to your mom.
-Brayden, where are you?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.158
I want my mama.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.494
We've gotta get you
out of here!

01:17.577 --> 01:20.121
Get away from him! You can't be here!

01:23.291 --> 01:24.709
-Stop it!
-Come on!

01:24.793 --> 01:26.503
-Stop it! No!
-Come on.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.088
-Let's go. Run!
-No!

01:28.171 --> 01:29.380
Where are you?

01:31.299 --> 01:32.675
Mommy!

01:33.718 --> 01:35.386
-Brayden! Come here.
-Mommy.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.431
-Thank goodness.
-I was scared, Mommy.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.059
Stop it! Stop it!

01:41.142 --> 01:42.477
No!

01:42.560 --> 01:44.104
<i>Get out!</i>

01:55.031 --> 01:55.865
Is he gone?

01:56.991 --> 01:58.952
Dion. Come on. We gotta go.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.750
Stop, Brayden! Come back!

02:05.834 --> 02:08.419
Don't go! Stop! Wait!

02:08.503 --> 02:09.963
Wait, stop!

02:11.506 --> 02:12.882
Brayden!

02:14.050 --> 02:15.844
-Stop!

02:19.973 --> 02:21.307
What the hell is going on?

02:23.393 --> 02:24.519
Vacation's over.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.251
I have a choice to present you.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.421
Our best estimates.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.885
At the rate your infection is moving,

02:56.968 --> 02:59.888
your body will be completely transformed
in less than two days.

03:03.892 --> 03:04.726
Okay.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.279
So what's my choice?

03:23.536 --> 03:26.164
I had a lab
run further tests on the serum,

03:26.247 --> 03:29.709
and we've realized that…
well, among other things,

03:30.251 --> 03:33.171
it suppresses the parasite's
ability to reproduce.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.716
And by "among other things,"

03:36.799 --> 03:40.136
you mean that the last time
you put that stuff in a guy, he died?

03:40.220 --> 03:44.515
Yes. It's toxic to the parasite,
but also the patient.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.894
We think that in a case like yours,

03:47.977 --> 03:50.313
where the infection
hasn't fully transformed you,

03:50.396 --> 03:54.025
that if you were
to administer very small doses,

03:54.108 --> 03:56.653
it would suppress
its ability to make spores.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.279
You wouldn't be contagious.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.615
As long as I keep injecting myself.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.575
It's a limited proposition.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.870
The serum <i>will</i> be killing you.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.164
But you could go home.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.917
Spend what time you have left with Dion.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.138
How… How much time?

04:26.140 --> 04:27.976
Three doses, 12-hour intervals.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.353
Thirty-six hours?

04:31.688 --> 04:32.522
More or less.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.738
-What?
-I'll be back.

04:40.822 --> 04:41.656
Sure.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.373
-Is everyone okay?
-Yeah. Thanks to Dion.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.126
How many rogue Powered people
do you have running around?

04:53.209 --> 04:54.043
No idea.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.920
Where's my mom? I wanna talk to my mom.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.673
Your mom isn't feeling well.
We're making sure she's okay.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.300
-I want to see her!
-Of course.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.761
I'll take you in a few minutes,
but first, about this kid--

05:03.845 --> 05:07.890
-His name is Brayden.
-Okay, Brayden. Let's game this out.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.976
BIONA has a team
that could approach Brayden.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.311
Like a SWAT team?

05:11.394 --> 05:13.855
A team that could maybe
convince him to come in and--

05:13.938 --> 05:14.772
He's just a kid.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.567
Who tried to scramble Tevin's brain
and make him hurt you.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.568
It's not SWAT.

05:18.651 --> 05:22.071
It's just scientists
trained in de-escalation

05:22.155 --> 05:25.199
who could explain what he's going through
and maybe get him to come in.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.827
So any information
you have about Brayden--

05:27.910 --> 05:30.580
Yeah, I was able to see the license plate
before they drove off.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.334
That helps. What about his parents?
You know their names?

05:34.917 --> 05:36.961
No, but he goes to my school.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.339
We'll call,
get an address and approach him.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.841
I'll go. I know what the kid looks like.

05:41.924 --> 05:44.802
I know what the car looks like.
I can protect the team.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.474
Let's go see your mom.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.769
Now they're gonna
send this team to his house.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.270
Like a SWAT team?

05:54.937 --> 05:56.814
They said no, but I'm worried.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.318
Di, that kid tried to hurt you.

06:01.402 --> 06:04.280
That doesn't mean he's bad.
I went into his memory palace.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.948
M-Memory palace?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.408
This place in his mind.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.536
I saw him.
He was little and crying out for his mom.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.747
She died when he was four.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.666
I don't want them to hurt him.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.672
Di, you're such a kind kid, but--

06:21.756 --> 06:23.383
I… I can feel him, Mom.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.259
I don't understand it yet,

06:25.343 --> 06:27.720
but I went into his head
and now I can feel him.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.931
He's really scared.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.604
How long do you have to stay in here?

06:38.064 --> 06:40.191
Until they can be sure I'm not contagious.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.653
I wanna go home.

06:46.948 --> 06:47.782
So do I.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.582
Hey, do me a favor.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.420
-Tell Auntie Kat I'm coming home.
-Yes!

07:01.754 --> 07:03.881
-I'll go meet you outside. Okay?
-Okay.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.776
You said we were going home!
You didn't say I'd have to do homework!

08:05.860 --> 08:08.404
I got a text saying
school's opening tomorrow, Di.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.866
You're gonna have classes
and a show to rehearse for, so go on.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.957
Now do you want to tell me
what's going on here?

08:35.848 --> 08:37.391
I have two more shots.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.061
It'll slow the spread.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.941
And I won't be contagious for 36 hours.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.610
And what happens after that?

08:53.866 --> 08:54.700
It's all over.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.496
What?

08:59.497 --> 09:00.331
No!

09:01.415 --> 09:04.418
BIONA has all that technology
and this is the best they could do?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.212
It's a miracle I'm even alive.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.257
And they gave me 36 good hours.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.552
No! I'm gonna go down there. We're gonna
figure this out. I cannot lose you.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.053
And find a cure by tomorrow?

09:17.181 --> 09:19.100
I'm not going down as a lab rat.

09:21.185 --> 09:24.146
Dion has healing powers.
Maybe he can fix this.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.190
Last time he did it, it almost killed him.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.233
He's older.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.403
Nic, h-he's strong.
He's stronger than he was.

09:33.447 --> 09:36.659
I'm not gonna risk
my son's life for my own.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.412
Why are you just giving up?
Why aren't you fighting?

09:39.495 --> 09:40.663
I'm… not.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.333
Don't you get it?

09:45.376 --> 09:46.794
This is the end of the line.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.423
Because I messed up, Kat.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.302
I should have never
gone down to that sinkhole, but I did.

09:54.385 --> 09:59.432
And now I won't get to do the thing
that I want to do more than anything else,

09:59.515 --> 10:00.975
and that's raise my son.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.112
If you… If you take that, then you die?

10:18.784 --> 10:19.619
I can't…

10:20.202 --> 10:21.037
But if I don't…

10:22.038 --> 10:23.998
I'll become a <i>thing.</i>

10:25.166 --> 10:28.878
A mindless, not even human <i>thing.</i>

10:36.594 --> 10:37.428
No.

10:37.511 --> 10:41.891
I-I am choosing
to give Dion the perfect day.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.477
Okay?

10:45.353 --> 10:48.648
And he's gonna go to school,
and he's gonna have his musical.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.277
And we'll be in the audience,

10:53.361 --> 10:57.239
and he'll look out
and he'll see how proud I am of him.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.826
I can't lose you.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.040
I can't.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.135
<i>We're gonna go around back.</i>
<i>Gonna check the perimeter.</i>

11:18.219 --> 11:19.053
That's the car.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.314
Hello? Anybody home?

11:33.317 --> 11:34.276
Can we come in?

12:03.055 --> 12:03.889
Sir?

12:08.018 --> 12:09.061
Ma'am, can you hear me?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.063
Can you hear me?

12:15.526 --> 12:16.777
Let's get 'em in the van.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.377
No! I don't wanna see you!
I don't wanna hurt anybody else!

13:15.461 --> 13:18.005
What you want
is irrelevant.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.716
No! You need me or you will die!

13:20.800 --> 13:24.678
You fed me well, and now I am strong.

13:24.762 --> 13:25.846
You are lying!

13:27.765 --> 13:32.311
Use your mind control and you will finish
what we came here to do!

13:32.394 --> 13:33.395
No!

13:33.979 --> 13:36.732
I wasn't asking!

13:56.710 --> 13:59.713
Wait, so you wanna make
a cloud out of Legos?

13:59.797 --> 14:04.218
Yeah, so our Bermuda Triangle
has a storm that eats ships.

14:04.301 --> 14:09.139
What kind of storm are we talking about?
A hurricane, monsoon, tropical depression?

14:12.726 --> 14:14.812
Hey, Di?
Hey, buddy, are you okay?

14:15.312 --> 14:16.146
He's gone.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.066
-Who's gone?
-Brayden.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.652
It's like he just vanished.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.153
But it hurts like he's--

14:25.531 --> 14:26.365
Is he dead?

14:29.034 --> 14:29.869
I don't know.

14:30.786 --> 14:31.620
He's just…

14:34.832 --> 14:35.666
gone.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.544
Come here.

14:40.629 --> 14:41.755
Aw.

15:24.506 --> 15:29.428
<i>Gone to BIONA. I finally remember</i>
<i>why I wanted to be a doctor. Love you.</i>

16:32.616 --> 16:33.450
Mom?

16:35.577 --> 16:36.412
Hey, Bug.

16:37.037 --> 16:37.871
Are you okay?

16:38.414 --> 16:39.289
Yeah.

16:39.873 --> 16:42.751
You know those famous pancakes
I make that you love so much?

16:42.835 --> 16:45.879
-You're gonna make pancakes?
-No, you are.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.298
-I'm gonna teach you.
-Really? Race ya.

17:12.906 --> 17:16.827
<i>After an avalanche</i>
<i>of complaints from busy working parents,</i>

17:17.369 --> 17:20.956
<i>the district superintendent</i>
<i>has cleared McKoy Elementary to reopen.</i>

17:21.040 --> 17:24.668
<i>A gas leak caused by a nearby sinkhole</i>
<i>closed the school--</i>

17:24.752 --> 17:26.128
-Morons.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.758
Thirty-six hours.
That's the best you could do?

17:30.841 --> 17:32.634
Send Nicole home with a death sentence?

17:32.718 --> 17:36.555
-We are doing everything we can.
-Did you try neutralizing the disease?

17:36.638 --> 17:39.600
-With antibodies from the creature? Yeah.
-What about antibiotics?

17:39.683 --> 17:40.976
Try the metallic complexes?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.562
I have lab teams
working every medical avenue.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.814
Everything you've suggested and more.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.234
I promise you, our best people are on it
and more are on the way.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.696
-I can't lose her.
-We are not going to.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.825
Now you're gonna
fluff up the flour.

17:56.909 --> 18:01.663
-Fluff it, grab it, level it, drop it.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.001
On the table.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.880
Nice and light.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.425
Sorry! All the way filled?

18:13.509 --> 18:15.511
-Now give me two of those.
-Okay.

18:25.687 --> 18:27.022
Good job.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.400
-My Mind Mover breakfast!

18:50.754 --> 18:51.588
It's Esperanza.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.383
Hey, what's up?

18:54.466 --> 18:55.801
<i>I need help.</i>

18:56.426 --> 18:57.386
What's going on?

18:57.886 --> 19:01.056
<i>It's Mr. Kwame. He's a lot.</i>

19:01.140 --> 19:03.433
<i>Any chance your mom could help me?</i>

19:04.017 --> 19:05.394
Hi, Esperanza. I can help.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.563
-Go get changed.
-Got it.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.899
<i>Mr. Kwame</i>
<i>cannot know that I called you.</i>

19:10.983 --> 19:13.777
<i>He says that the show is his vision.</i>

19:14.528 --> 19:17.865
Kwame wouldn't mind. He knows you guys
are just supposed to be having fun.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.826
<i>Does he? Please don't tell him.</i>

19:20.909 --> 19:23.871
Okay, I won't.
Well, when do you want to get together?

19:23.954 --> 19:25.497
-<i>Now.</i>
-Now?

19:32.629 --> 19:33.881
Let's do this thing.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.012
This is an exposure radius
of patient zero's whereabouts

19:40.095 --> 19:41.096
before he was brought in.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.433
We're monitoring local hospitals
for any uptick in symptoms.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.936
The hospitals haven't reported anything
yet, but it's only a matter of time.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.396
Time's up.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.024
He was my patient.

19:52.608 --> 19:56.653
So whatever this infection is,
it's out there and it's multiplying.

19:56.737 --> 19:59.364
I called the top epidemiologists
who specialize in outbreaks.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.407
They're on their way.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.201
Do any have medical experience

20:02.284 --> 20:04.286
-working with Powered people?
-No.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.664
How many have tracked the progression
of this infection in real time?

20:08.415 --> 20:09.958
<i>I </i>need to be in that lab.

20:20.552 --> 20:25.557
Oh, uh, Kat, you're… here. Uh…

20:26.433 --> 20:28.185
Uh, sh-shake hands or

20:29.478 --> 20:30.312
hug it out?

20:30.896 --> 20:31.855
Tell me what's going on.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.860
So it looks like this is
a protozoal infection

20:36.944 --> 20:40.656
that infiltrates the bloodstream
and multiplies fast.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.491
The serum we made stops the infection,

20:42.574 --> 20:45.410
but doesn't stop the patient's
immune system from breaking down.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.039
-We still don't know why.
-So what's your new strategy?

20:49.122 --> 20:52.209
Well, we were able to isolate
Powered strands of DNA.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.127
<i>You </i>isolated Powered DNA?

20:54.211 --> 20:57.256
No. A young woman named Janelle did.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.509
She has the power of breaking things down
into their elemental blocks.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.760
Okay, whatever.

21:01.843 --> 21:05.013
So I thought, if this parasite
is infiltrating cell walls

21:05.097 --> 21:06.723
and disrupting its functions,

21:06.807 --> 21:11.895
what if we targeted these cells
and replaced them with Powered strands?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.939
Like super-powered gene therapy.

21:14.022 --> 21:18.568
Whoa, "super-powered gene therapy."
I like the sound of that.

21:18.652 --> 21:22.698
Yeah. And so would my sister.
You know, the one who's dying.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.117
Sorry. Please, carry on.

21:27.035 --> 21:30.372
So, the Powered strands
could give a regular human the ability

21:30.455 --> 21:33.250
to fight a super parasite
on a cellular level.

21:33.333 --> 21:37.087
Now, it's just a matter of finding
the right combination of Powered DNA.

21:37.170 --> 21:40.382
Reproducible gene therapy
made from strands of Powered DNA.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.676
This could be
the growth industry of the century.

21:42.759 --> 21:43.969
Yeah, I'm sorry.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.722
Suzanne, could you
ask him to leave, please?

21:47.306 --> 21:48.265
No, she can't.

21:49.057 --> 21:52.144
She no longer has authority over me.
Isn't that right, Suzanne?

21:54.146 --> 21:54.980
I'm sorry.

21:56.023 --> 21:56.857
Okay.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.736
Well, while you're counting dollar signs,

22:00.819 --> 22:03.363
I'm counting the minutes
I have left with my sister.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.908
We're running out of time.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.078
I'll take a step back.

22:16.543 --> 22:20.172
Okay, I asked Dion
to give us some privacy.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.050
Tell me what's going on.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.386
Mr. Kwame expects me
to sing this huge song

22:26.470 --> 22:28.305
and it's all gonna be garbage.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.182
No, it's not.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.435
Why don't you show me what you got so far?

23:01.755 --> 23:02.798
Okay.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.841
Let's pause for one moment.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.885
I told you it was bad.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.720
Hey, I didn't say that.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.430
You got some pipes on you, girl.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.809
It's just the song
doesn't sound like you yet.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.560
I don't know what to do with my hands.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.814
Your hands, they're not the problem.
Well, not the main problem.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.317
-Do you know what this song is about?
-No.

23:22.401 --> 23:27.948
Okay, well, you're playing Effie,
who is really talented,

23:28.448 --> 23:31.243
but really difficult,
and so she ends up getting kicked out

23:31.326 --> 23:34.329
of her own singing group
and her fiancé breaks up with her.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.706
Why are we doing this musical?

23:36.790 --> 23:37.999
That's a great question.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.252
But that ship has sailed.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.004
So,

23:44.131 --> 23:49.261
some of the best performances
are when you use the song

23:49.886 --> 23:51.430
to tell us about you.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.349
I'm ten years old. I don't have a fiancé.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.436
See, but all this emotion here,
you need to put that into the song.

23:58.061 --> 24:02.774
Just don't even think about the words.
Just let <i>that</i> emotion come through.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.193
I'm gonna be terrible.
Everyone's gonna laugh at me.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.904
Hey, no.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.158
When you share
your feelings with the audience,

24:11.241 --> 24:13.952
they'll feel it too,
and they'll love you for it.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.545
What am I supposed to do?

24:27.215 --> 24:30.177
Don't think about anything
but the moment. Okay?

24:30.886 --> 24:32.095
Just show your heart.

24:34.639 --> 24:35.474
Try again?

24:43.523 --> 24:46.067
-Thanks for the coffee.
-Thanks for meeting me.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.445
Dion's school is just down the street,

24:48.528 --> 24:50.989
so I wanted to be there today
for when the bell rang.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.616
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

24:54.493 --> 24:58.121
Well, uh, I'm flattered to be your coffee…

24:58.663 --> 25:00.582
Date. You can call it a coffee date.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.833
So… So this is a date?

25:02.834 --> 25:03.668
Sure.

25:05.837 --> 25:09.216
So, all things being normal,
you would say that this is a thing?

25:10.550 --> 25:13.845
Usually it takes a few dates
before you can call it a thing,

25:15.639 --> 25:17.557
but sure.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.476
I think it would be.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.484
So, about Dion…

25:29.736 --> 25:34.866
I know you just started coaching him,
but he has really taken to you.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.329
All he ever talks about
is your training sessions.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.792
I know Kat will take care of him…

25:45.961 --> 25:48.380
but she's not Powered and--

25:48.463 --> 25:51.508
Nicole. You don't have to ask.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.135
I <i>will</i> protect him.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.931
I will be there for him, no matter what.

25:58.807 --> 25:59.641
I promise.

26:04.854 --> 26:07.274
Thank you… so much.

26:15.407 --> 26:20.036
We should do something
to commemorate the moment.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.498
I don't think I'll forget it,
but what'd you have in mind?

26:23.582 --> 26:24.416
Well,

26:25.333 --> 26:28.336
um, these donuts are incredible.

26:30.046 --> 26:33.967
And the fact that I'm sharing it with you,
I mean, that's a moment in itself, so…

26:34.050 --> 26:35.010
Wow.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.929
-Cheers.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.480
Next trial, healing power chromosomes

26:47.564 --> 26:49.941
with added strands
of mental manipulation DNA.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.112
Side note, that's probably
one of the coolest things I've ever said.

26:54.195 --> 26:55.113
Pat?

26:55.196 --> 26:57.240
Yeah, no. Uh, right. Focus.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.831
-Damn it.
-The parasite cell is too aggressive.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.292
Whoa.

27:07.375 --> 27:11.212
Wait a second. It looks like the healing
and mental manipulation powers are

27:12.297 --> 27:13.131
bonding?

27:13.214 --> 27:16.676
That's impossible.
Those chromosomes shouldn't match.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.766
It's like the P-DNA strands
are able to adapt

27:22.849 --> 27:26.227
and bond with each other,
no matter who they came from.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.813
Does that mean we can
fuse different powers together?

27:28.897 --> 27:31.608
-Create new ones that could be--
-Injected into the body.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.525
Yes.

27:32.609 --> 27:35.445
Theoretically, you could
give someone powers they didn't have,

27:35.528 --> 27:37.322
or-or change the ones they have.

27:37.405 --> 27:39.032
Will this help Nicole?

27:39.783 --> 27:41.868
Keep running as many trials as you can.

27:41.951 --> 27:44.371
I'm gonna go back to the drawing board
on Pat's antidote.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.750
-Pat?
-Yup. Yes.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.798
What were you like in school?

27:56.007 --> 27:58.593
Uh, middle school, okay.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.514
High school, hot mess.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.434
-No.
-College, so much worse.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.478
-Okay.

28:08.561 --> 28:09.396
Yeah.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.231
I mean, what about you?

28:11.314 --> 28:14.317
I bet you were on the honor roll,
and president of the student body.

28:14.401 --> 28:15.402
Uh,

28:16.277 --> 28:17.112
nah.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.739
I was way too nervous
for that kind of thing.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.242
You, nervous? Really?

28:22.867 --> 28:23.702
Yeah.

28:24.703 --> 28:29.082
The, uh, proper diagnosis
is anxiety disorder.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.960
But we didn't know that then.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.131
My parents worked a lot.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.927
I had younger siblings, so when
I was old enough to take care of them,

28:42.512 --> 28:43.388
I, uh…

28:44.305 --> 28:46.683
I would… I would be so scared that…

28:48.101 --> 28:50.061
that they would just get lost or hurt.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.732
I had this overwhelming fear
that I would let them down.

28:56.651 --> 28:59.988
To the point I had this tightness
in my chest where I couldn't even breathe.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.907
It sounds like a panic attack.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.868
I'm sure they were.

29:06.953 --> 29:10.582
Mental health really
wasn't a conversation in my family.

29:13.168 --> 29:17.046
I sort of had to learn
how to internalize it,

29:18.256 --> 29:20.133
convince myself that it wasn't there.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.260
By putting up walls?

29:23.386 --> 29:24.220
Yeah.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.515
It's actually the reason
I started running.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.685
Because, you know, out there, it's just…

29:32.854 --> 29:35.857
It's just me, and I get to clear my head.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.360
And it worked for a while.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.696
Until I got my powers.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.116
Yeah, well, that couldn't have helped.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.075
No.

29:47.869 --> 29:48.953
No, it, um…

29:51.039 --> 29:53.208
It set everything off again.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.668
You know, the fear, the…

29:57.712 --> 29:58.546
worry.

29:59.255 --> 30:02.509
The scariest part was that I didn't know
what was happening to me.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.011
I didn't know what to do.

30:06.137 --> 30:10.767
Literally, it felt like I was drowning,
and I didn't know how to ask for help.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.477
Not even from my wife.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.314
Ex-wife.

30:18.525 --> 30:19.359
Hmm.

30:19.442 --> 30:20.610
I shut her out.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.489
The relationship just fell apart.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.577
But it did lead me to get help.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.246
Too little, too late.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.457
I just want to make sure
I don't make the same mistakes again.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.460
No more walls.

30:37.544 --> 30:40.463
I like that. No more walls.

30:41.714 --> 30:44.008
-No more emotional walls.

30:44.884 --> 30:47.428
Where, force fields…
I can do that all day long.

30:52.016 --> 30:56.104
I wish we had
a few more of these, because…

30:58.690 --> 31:00.275
it definitely would be a thing.

31:05.196 --> 31:10.034
I mean, we could just,
you know, go ahead and…

31:10.702 --> 31:11.536
Call it?

31:13.288 --> 31:14.122
Why not?

31:22.505 --> 31:24.215
-Are you okay?

31:27.468 --> 31:28.303
Yeah.

31:29.679 --> 31:30.597
-Oh.
-Oh.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.019
-Uh… I need to go home.
-All right, let's go.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.274
A lot of Atlanta's
Civil War battlefields have disappeared

31:41.357 --> 31:43.735
because buildings
were built on top of them.

31:43.818 --> 31:46.738
-Like our school.

31:46.821 --> 31:51.284
But just because we can't see something
doesn't mean it's not--

31:55.288 --> 31:56.122
Jonathan?

31:58.791 --> 32:00.585
What's going on?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.593
Brayden? I thought you were gone.

32:09.510 --> 32:13.306
Not until I take out
everyone you care about.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.437
No!

32:25.735 --> 32:29.030
Jonathan, the TOJ needs you. Wake up!

32:38.247 --> 32:40.792
Dion!
You can't get away from me!

32:47.423 --> 32:48.257
What?

32:49.133 --> 32:53.304
<i>Am I really</i>
<i>here, Dion? Or am I inside your head?</i>

33:00.228 --> 33:03.940
<i>You can't fight us if you don't know</i>
<i>which one of us is real.</i>

33:11.906 --> 33:15.952
-Why are you doing this, Brayden?
-<i>You have everything.</i>

33:16.452 --> 33:20.373
<i>A home, a mom, friends.</i>

33:21.040 --> 33:25.670
<i>Now you're going to know</i>
<i>how it feels to be all alone.</i>

33:33.386 --> 33:34.762
Triangle power!

33:42.562 --> 33:44.105
Give it up, Brayden!

33:47.442 --> 33:50.403
-<i>You. You're on my side now.</i>
Nope.

33:50.486 --> 33:53.698
<i>I said, you're on my side.</i>

33:53.781 --> 33:56.701
Oh, I heard you.
I'm just not listening to you.

33:57.744 --> 34:00.288
You can't beat
the Triangle of Justice.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.300
This isn't working.

34:12.383 --> 34:16.262
We just haven't found the right
combination of Powered strands yet.

34:16.345 --> 34:19.223
So I'm throwing them all in.
One of these has to work.

34:19.307 --> 34:22.685
-That's way too many variables.
-Well, we have to try.

34:22.769 --> 34:25.063
Guys, I think I found something.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.524
I figured out how Pat's antidote works.

34:28.608 --> 34:32.904
You mixed healing P-DNA with an inactive
pathogen contained in the parasite, right?

34:33.404 --> 34:34.739
Yes, to trigger the immune system

34:34.822 --> 34:37.116
into recognizing
and destroying the invading cells.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.660
And the healing DNA
is able to revert the mutated cells

34:39.744 --> 34:41.412
back to their pre-infected form.

34:41.496 --> 34:44.957
But they continue to attack those cells,
even once they're healthy again.

34:45.958 --> 34:49.003
Attacking healthy cells,
like really aggressive chemotherapy.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.590
Right. The body is turning on the cells
that were previously infected,

34:52.673 --> 34:54.634
so the more infected cells
the patient has--

34:54.717 --> 34:57.512
The faster they die.
That's what's happening to Nicole.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.639
And that's why
our patient died so quickly.

34:59.722 --> 35:03.142
The P-DNA isn't working.
We need a different strategy.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.685
Specialist team is here.

35:05.394 --> 35:06.979
But before they come in,

35:07.063 --> 35:09.190
you and I need to have
a private conversation.

35:09.273 --> 35:12.151
In a minute.
Uh, please escort Pat back to his cell.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.779
-Yes, ma'am.
-What? No, I'm working lead on this.

35:14.862 --> 35:19.033
You helped us during a crisis,
but now the experts are here.

35:19.117 --> 35:22.787
Wait, y-y-y-you can't do this.
This is my research. That's my antidote!

35:22.870 --> 35:24.580
Hold on. Just everybody calm down.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.166
Didn't you say this was
an all-hands situation?

35:27.250 --> 35:29.544
Pat's trials have failed.

35:30.044 --> 35:33.005
-Uh--
-The experts can explore his ideas.

35:33.089 --> 35:36.050
But we are working with
highly sensitive information.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.885
We need to be able to trust our team.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.637
Are you… Are you kidding me?

35:41.347 --> 35:44.392
How much <i>more</i> do I need to <i>do?</i>

35:44.475 --> 35:47.478
I mean, I… At some point,
I deserve to be forgiven.

35:47.562 --> 35:48.646
Deserve?!

35:50.648 --> 35:52.316
You haven't changed one bit.

35:53.401 --> 35:57.488
You killed a lot of people, Pat.
What did you expect?

35:57.572 --> 35:59.782
That you would find a cure
and suddenly be the hero?

36:01.617 --> 36:03.828
So you're just gonna keep me
locked in L5 forever?

36:04.829 --> 36:07.331
We are going to do
what we were always going to do.

36:07.415 --> 36:10.543
Find a way to extinguish
every last spark of power inside of you

36:10.626 --> 36:12.545
so you can't hurt anyone else.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.130
But until then…

36:19.594 --> 36:20.595
Okay, let's go.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.349
You just took
a valuable asset off the team.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.684
Cutler is gonna be pissed.

36:26.767 --> 36:27.977
I don't care.

36:28.060 --> 36:28.895
Look around.

36:29.395 --> 36:32.982
We are all trying to stop a parasitic
outbreak that could end all of us.

36:33.065 --> 36:36.819
So stop worrying about your career
and show the specialists in.

36:45.536 --> 36:46.537
I'm sorry.

36:49.457 --> 36:52.668
Listen up. This is what we know
about the infection.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.271
-Dion.
-No sign of Brayden anywhere.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.314
It doesn't seem like anybody
saw what happened.

37:55.398 --> 37:58.150
We're lucky we cleaned everything up
before they woke up.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.486
Sorry I didn't tell you guys
about Brayden having powers.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.030
Dude, sorry your friend
turned out to be a demon.

38:03.990 --> 38:07.535
We've been through a lot,
but the Triangle stayed strong.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.245
Invisible Girl.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.372
Mind Mover.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.499
Admiral Annihilation.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.210
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah, he's earned it.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.255
Three become one.
We're stronger together.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.674
Triangle of Justice!

38:23.092 --> 38:24.010
There you are.

38:24.093 --> 38:24.969
Tevin.

38:25.469 --> 38:27.346
Brayden came back, but we defeated him.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.141
We gotta get you home. Come on.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.073
What… Mom?

38:47.825 --> 38:48.826
What's going on?

38:49.910 --> 38:51.829
Dion, your mom is sick.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.459
-No--
-She didn't want you to worry, buddy.

38:56.542 --> 38:57.918
-Didn't want you to worry.
-Let me--

38:58.002 --> 38:59.086
Okay.

39:01.255 --> 39:02.298
Mom?

39:03.966 --> 39:05.217
Why didn't you tell me?

39:06.344 --> 39:07.303
I can heal her.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.682
Mom, wake up. Wake up!

39:11.766 --> 39:14.226
Dion, please back away from her.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.937
Dion… no.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.648
I'm older now. I can heal you.

39:25.404 --> 39:26.322
Oh.

39:31.118 --> 39:32.244
Dion, stop!

39:37.291 --> 39:40.461
-Come on, please.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.131
Mom, no. Are you…?

39:48.260 --> 39:49.804
You can't heal me now.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.099
No!

39:55.768 --> 39:57.436
No!

39:58.562 --> 40:00.898
No, no, no, no.

40:00.981 --> 40:02.608
No.
