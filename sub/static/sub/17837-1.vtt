.

00:08.509 --> 00:08.842
[wind blowing]

00:15.083 --> 00:17.185
- A bullet will kill you
three ways.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.087
The first way: extremities.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.255
Miss a major artery
and you got ten to 20 minutes

00:21.289 --> 00:23.491
before you bleed out.
[gunshot]

00:23.524 --> 00:27.095
The second way: anywhere
in the tens, center chest.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.497
The bullet will tumble,
lots of bone to splinter,

00:29.530 --> 00:31.132
the heart
or the arteries get hit,

00:31.165 --> 00:34.135
blood pressure drops to zero.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.236
[gunshot]

00:35.269 --> 00:37.605
The final way is the kill shot.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.574
Middle of the skull,
any angle.

00:40.608 --> 00:44.112
Like a marionette
with the strings cut,

00:44.145 --> 00:47.181
you're dead before your brain
can process what happened.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.483
Guns change everything,

00:49.517 --> 00:52.620
and a bullet is forever.

I'm not here to hurt you.

*

02:41.395 --> 02:43.531
[quietly]
Yeah, there you go.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.436
Just a little something
in case you get an infection.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.705
Be good to go in a day.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.709
[approaching laughter]

03:02.583 --> 03:03.751
- Hey, that wolf is ours.

03:03.784 --> 03:07.255
- She might have
a different opinion.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.556
- What did you do to it?

03:08.589 --> 03:12.493
- Tranquilizer,
so I could get that trap off.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.828
What you got there?

03:14.862 --> 03:16.730
- What the hell are you doing?

03:16.764 --> 03:18.566
*

03:18.599 --> 03:20.568
- Let me guess, dentist?

03:20.601 --> 03:21.835
- Orthodontist.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.504
What does that have to do
with anything?

03:23.537 --> 03:26.307
- .223 Remington.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.545
55 grain?

03:31.579 --> 03:33.781
You guys have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

03:33.814 --> 03:35.583
The kid at Walmart
who sold you this crap

03:35.616 --> 03:36.784
should've told you.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.752
This bullet isn't
powerful enough

03:38.786 --> 03:40.821
to take down anything bigger
than a squirrel.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.590
- How 'bout this one?

03:42.623 --> 03:46.394
You think it has enough
stopping power for you?

03:48.362 --> 03:51.499
- Washington State doesn't allow
trap hunting of wolves.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.367
But, even if it was legal,

03:53.401 --> 03:55.869
it's a bullshit way
to kill an animal like that.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.472
If you're gonna hunt, at least
give the animal a chance.

03:58.506 --> 04:02.343
- Well, we ain't giving out
chances today, asshole.

when you can't move.

about you squaws *

04:39.780 --> 04:41.615
- Daddy!

04:41.649 --> 04:44.485
Mama, Daddy's home!

- * I'm getting hit
by wild squalls *

04:45.619 --> 04:46.887
- He's home?
- Yeah.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.656
- Yeah?

[car door opens]

04:51.525 --> 04:52.660

04:52.693 --> 04:54.528
- You save me any dinner
kitten-mouse?

04:54.562 --> 04:57.798
- Mom said you were
supposed to be bringing dinner.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.868
Mom, Dad didn't get dinner.
- What?

05:00.901 --> 05:02.836
Do you think maybe
he's pulling your leg?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.472
- I don't know.
Maybe?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.640
- Yeah, let's hope so.
[both chuckle]

05:09.142 --> 05:10.778
- I found it.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.112
Come on down and get it
for your mom.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.881
- Go grab it.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.851
- I gotta put my tools away.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.887
- Okay, honey.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.442
I got it all, right?

05:41.475 --> 05:43.577
Your orange chicken, egg rolls,

05:43.611 --> 05:45.946
and extra sweet and sour sauce.
- Yeah.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.148
I did see that.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.550
I'm surprised though.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.619
I know you went hunting all day,

05:51.652 --> 05:54.722
and all you shot me was
Chinese takeout, huh?

05:54.755 --> 05:57.758
- I had something,
but I missed.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.560
- Bullshit.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.730
You don't miss, Bob Lee.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.565
- Missed you.
- Mm.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.167
- Bless us, oh, Lord,
for these thy gifts,

06:07.200 --> 06:08.869
which we're about to receive,

06:08.902 --> 06:11.705
from thy bounty
through Christ our Lord.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.007
both: Amen.
- Good job, honey.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.710
I think that was
your best grace yet.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.512
- You say that every night.
- [laughs softly]

06:18.546 --> 06:19.747
- He does, doesn't he?

06:19.780 --> 06:22.550
- 'Cause you keep
getting better.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.817
- There you go.
- Don't you get bored

06:23.851 --> 06:25.753
all alone up there?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.588
- Bored?

06:27.621 --> 06:30.491
How could I get bored
in all that beautiful nature

06:30.524 --> 06:32.926
and animals and plants and...

06:32.960 --> 06:34.828
there's a million things
to do out there.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.797
- But there's no internet.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.599
- [laughs softly]
- Exactly.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.200
That's the whole point.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.969
That's why it's
Daddy's happy place.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.771
- [laughs]

06:45.539 --> 06:47.508
- Up the wooden hill,

06:47.541 --> 06:49.710
and it is time for bed.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.913
- No, Daddy.
- Yes, Mary.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.482
Ready?
[grunts]

06:54.515 --> 06:56.450
Boom.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.652
Here, get under.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.853
- Story first.

06:59.887 --> 07:03.557
- Oh, I'm--
you know what?

07:03.591 --> 07:05.859
Your mommy really wants me
to spend some time with her.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.461
Can we do story tomorrow?

07:07.495 --> 07:09.763
- Please, please, please, Daddy.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.666
- Okay.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.835
What do you wanna hear?
- Kandahar!

07:14.868 --> 07:17.738
- Oh, honey,
Kandahar takes too long.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.740
- Tikrit?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.609
Fine, Basrah.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.810
- [quietly]
Oh, Basrah.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.678
You've heard this one,
like, six times.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.781
- Then this will make seven.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.250
- All right.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.820
So we're going after
Basan Al Amini.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.822
We got a small squad.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.590
Donny and I were on recon.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.692
- Night vision?

07:38.726 --> 07:41.695
- We don't need night vision.
We're Marines.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.998
- Semper fi.
- Semper fi.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.906
- Why don't you just use
your kung fu to break it?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.843
- It's not called kung fu,
Mouse.

07:55.876 --> 07:56.977
It's not for cutting wood.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.112
[car approaches and stops]

07:59.146 --> 08:01.582
- Who's that, Daddy?

08:01.615 --> 08:03.551
[car door opens]
Will you go get Daddy an OJ?

08:03.584 --> 08:04.852
Please?

08:04.885 --> 08:06.720
Go on.
[car door closes]

08:10.924 --> 08:13.794
You've been parked up at
the turnout for about an hour,

08:13.827 --> 08:15.963
trying to make me nervous?
- [chuckles]

08:15.996 --> 08:17.998
I thought snipers
didn't get nervous?

08:18.031 --> 08:20.033
- I said trying.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.673
It's good to see you, Gunny.
- You too, Captain Johnson.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.708
- Even though
you were hard to track down.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.543
Couldn't find any place
more remote?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.078
- I don't mind people.
I just like to see 'em coming.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.881
- [chuckles]
You look good, Bob Lee.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.749
How's the hip?

08:35.783 --> 08:38.018
- Don't think I'll be in
Cirque du Soleil anytime soon,

08:38.051 --> 08:40.754
but getting by.

08:40.788 --> 08:44.625
Is this a friendly call
or Secret Service business?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.126
Your lapel pin.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.828
That's color of the day, right?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.597
- [chuckles]

08:49.630 --> 08:51.799
Damn, you really don't
miss a thing, do you?

08:51.832 --> 08:54.034
Turns out a guy who ran snipers
for the Corps

08:54.067 --> 08:56.036
actually has some value.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.038
I'm on the president's
advance team.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.640
- All right.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.642
- You got a place we could talk,
privately?

09:01.675 --> 09:04.544
- Yeah, it's down here.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.722
- [chuckles]

09:16.824 --> 09:19.059
I see you are still
a bleeding heart liberal.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.928
- You never know when shit's
gonna get weird.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.630
- [chuckles]

09:22.663 --> 09:24.598
- What can I do for you,
Captain?

09:24.632 --> 09:26.700
- This is gonna be one of those
conversations we never had.

09:26.734 --> 09:27.935
[zipper rasps]

09:27.968 --> 09:30.671
Ten days ago,
a CIA agent was killed

09:30.704 --> 09:32.673
in Seneca State Forest,
Virginia.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.941
He was shot by a sniper.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.110
We found the hide
1,400 yards away.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.080
- Damn.
- No evidence of multiple shots.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.851
- Damn, 1,400 yards.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.819
One shot,
so he couldn't afford to miss.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.821
He had lots of trees.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.824
Three steps and the target would
be behind the canopy, right?

09:50.858 --> 09:53.827
[dramatic music]

09:53.861 --> 09:56.396
*

09:56.429 --> 09:58.098
That doesn't look like
a .50 cal.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.668
- .338 based on the slug.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.002
- All right, so...

10:02.035 --> 10:04.638
3/4-mile shot through the woods.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.674
You got humidity, vegetation,

10:06.707 --> 10:10.644
hell, even the rotation
of the Earth could be a factor.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.713
Boy's a shooter.

10:12.746 --> 10:13.981
[gunshot]

10:14.014 --> 10:16.016
*

10:16.049 --> 10:18.686
- Oh, yeah,
he's a shooter all right.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.089
This was written
to the president.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.958
It states that in 21 days
he'll be executed

10:24.992 --> 10:27.194
at Seattle Science
and Robotic Center.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.429
The letter says, and I quote,

10:29.462 --> 10:33.266
"I am the angel of death.
No one can stop me."

10:33.300 --> 10:36.136
We believe
this is from T. Solotov.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.205
*

10:38.238 --> 10:40.140
- Solotov?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.876
Are you f---ing kidding me?

10:42.910 --> 10:45.713
- No.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.849
- What the hell is a Chechen
sniper doing in Virginia?

10:48.882 --> 10:51.151
- I don't know
and right now I don't care.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.253
My job is to protect
the president.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.755
That's why I'm here.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.890
- I gotta check on my daughter.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.759
*

10:58.792 --> 11:00.961
- There's only a handful
of shooters in the world

11:00.994 --> 11:03.096
who would take a shot
from 3/4 of a mile away,

11:03.130 --> 11:05.165
much less a headshot,
and make it,

11:05.198 --> 11:06.767
and you're one of 'em.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.869
That's why I need your help
to stop him.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.070
- You got plenty of smart guys
around you.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.872
- You gotta understand.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.907
We get hundreds of threats a day
against the president.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.043
I don't have the resources
to scout a shot

11:16.076 --> 11:19.212
taken 500 yards outside
of our tier-three perimeter.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.982
Yeah, I got a handful of guys,
but no one like you.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.184
- Daddy,
we gotta finish the porch

11:24.217 --> 11:25.786
before Mommy gets home.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.255
- Yeah, I'll be right there,
honey.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.992
As you can see,
I'm kind of busy.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.828
- What happened to you,
Gunny?

11:34.862 --> 11:36.263
I'm asking for your help.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.299
The president is asking.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.134
Look, man...

11:41.168 --> 11:44.104
nobody blames you
for Donny getting shot,

11:44.137 --> 11:45.839
but you gotta put that shit
behind you

11:45.873 --> 11:48.341
and move on.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.044
- I've moved on, Captain.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.313
- Your country needs you,
Bob Lee.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.756
- What did he want?

12:02.790 --> 12:05.025
- Ah, nothing, baby.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.267
.

12:14.301 --> 12:14.802
[electronic music]

12:15.869 --> 12:18.405
- [speaking Russian]

12:24.577 --> 12:27.247
[woman moaning]
[man laughing]

12:27.280 --> 12:28.315
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.518
[man speaking Russian]
[woman moaning]

12:33.253 --> 12:36.223
[dramatic music]

12:36.256 --> 12:39.292
*

12:39.326 --> 12:42.462
- Go get him.
Quietly.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.297
- All right, gentlemen,
that's a green light.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.299
- Copy that.
[engine starts]

12:46.333 --> 12:50.237
*

12:50.270 --> 12:51.538
- Come on, Mikey,
how much longer?

12:51.571 --> 12:53.006
- This is not
as easy as it looks.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.943
- Well, I need it to be.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.310
[tumbler clicks]
- Got it.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.546
[cell phone vibrates]

12:59.579 --> 13:04.818
*

13:04.852 --> 13:07.821
[suspenseful music]

*

13:25.072 --> 13:28.241
[man speaking Russian]

13:30.510 --> 13:34.447
- FBI, everybody down!

13:34.481 --> 13:37.450
[indistinct chatter]

13:37.484 --> 13:39.419
What the hell are you guys
doing here?

13:41.354 --> 13:42.856
Dimitri...

13:42.890 --> 13:43.991
[speaking Russian]

13:44.024 --> 13:45.926
Hey, Dimitri!

13:45.959 --> 13:46.960
*

13:46.994 --> 13:47.961
Dimitri!

13:47.995 --> 13:49.329
[both grunt]

13:49.362 --> 13:51.865
- What the hell you doing here?
- FBI!

13:51.899 --> 13:54.501
- Homeland, we got here first.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.370
Could you point that thing
somewhere else?

13:57.404 --> 13:59.372
- [grunting and breathing heavy]

13:59.406 --> 14:00.974
- [speaking Russian]

14:01.008 --> 14:03.010
- Shut up.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.981
- What?

14:08.015 --> 14:09.516
Oh, come on,
that's six months of work

14:09.549 --> 14:10.918
you're loading into that van.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.519
- What's your name, Agent?

14:12.552 --> 14:14.421
- Oh, my God, you Homeland guys
are unbelievable.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.523
I mean, at least let me
talk to him first.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.659
- I assume you called the
Washington State Fusion Center,

14:19.692 --> 14:21.929
got your ops plan
on the war-board?

14:21.962 --> 14:24.965
So that no other federal agency
would step on your toes?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.499
Isaac Johnson, Secret Service.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.935
Let me get the admin on call.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.502
I'm having
a jurisdictional issue.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.371
- Wait, wait, I did have time
to get it on the war-board.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.406
Regardless, he's my asset.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.009
At least tell me
why you took him.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.611
- Why do you want him?

14:38.645 --> 14:40.347
- He told me he had
time-sensitive intel.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.982
- Intel on what?

14:42.015 --> 14:46.053
- Voydian runs
an illegal import business.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.488
You know what?
I got a novel idea...

14:48.521 --> 14:50.023
I mean, why don't we
work together, you know?

14:50.057 --> 14:52.492
FBI, Secret Service,
Homeland,

14:52.525 --> 14:54.027
we're all on the same side,
right?

14:54.061 --> 14:56.429
- No.
Let me see your shield.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.072
Agent Memphis.

15:05.105 --> 15:08.575
So you cowboy into a known
Russian mob establishment

15:08.608 --> 15:11.644
over illegal imports?

15:11.678 --> 15:14.047
Oh, you thought
it was something bigger?

15:14.081 --> 15:18.351
- Yeah, well, guess I was right
since you just snatched him up.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.020
You gonna tell me why?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.488
- No.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.656
Nice to meet you.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.494
- [exhales]

15:31.098 --> 15:33.733
- She went down like a rock.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.503
- Well, we worked hard today.
- Yeah.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.671
Deck looks good.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.678
- Hey, I was gonna tell you.
- About?

15:45.712 --> 15:48.481
- About Captain Johnson
coming by.

15:48.515 --> 15:52.085
She just beat me to it.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.021
- She said he offered you a job.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.623
- Yeah, he said,
uh, some sniper

15:56.656 --> 15:59.159
made a crazy threat
against the president.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.593
Wanted me to help him clear it.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.396
- Sniper who?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.767
Solotov?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.503
Jesus.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.106
[exhales]
Listen...

16:13.140 --> 16:16.509
I know that you don't like
to talk about this stuff,

16:16.543 --> 16:19.179
but what happened to Donny,

16:19.212 --> 16:22.482
I know that it still hurts you.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.617
Just let me in.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.654
[Gillbanks' "Anxious?"]

16:27.687 --> 16:30.157
- * I'm always wondering

16:30.190 --> 16:33.526
* How you put up
with it *

16:33.560 --> 16:38.131
* I'm just a kid,
I promise I'm okay *

16:38.165 --> 16:39.532
*

16:39.566 --> 16:43.070
* I'm not gonna take you out

16:43.103 --> 16:44.671
* Surprise

16:44.704 --> 16:48.541
* 'Cause I don't really
care enough *

16:48.575 --> 16:53.446
* About you

16:53.480 --> 16:55.548
- We've been going over
this plan for a week, sir.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.716
We're ready to get after it.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.551
- Status change
on the Chechen sniper?

16:58.585 --> 17:00.587
- He could be everywhere
or nowhere.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.289
Either way, we're good to go.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.591
- You know they brought that
asshole here to nail you, right?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.659
- If he's keeping me
from getting behind my rifle,

17:06.693 --> 17:09.062
he already has.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.598
I'm not doing anybody any favors
PT'ing all day.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.267
- You're not doing any favors if
you get yourself killed either.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.702
- Yes, sir.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.470
- You and Donny ready
for the green light?

17:17.504 --> 17:19.106
- 100%, sir.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.174
- Consider it lit.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.842
Hey, stay dangerous.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.245
- Yes, sir!

17:25.278 --> 17:27.514
Time to hunt, Pork.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.082
- Damn, finally.

17:29.116 --> 17:30.550
What's the plan?

17:30.583 --> 17:31.818
- Overwatch for Delta.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.686
We got a four klick hump
to our number one.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.855
- Four, that's all?
Thought this was gonna be hard.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.590
At this rate,
I'ma die of old age.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.259
- That's the best way to die.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.094
All right, get your shit
in one bag and let's go.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.495
- All right, all right.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.497
It's about damn time,
gentlemen.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.166
- Pork gonna get some.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.101
Donny had a saying:

17:48.135 --> 17:50.703
"A bullet is forever."

17:50.737 --> 17:52.739
And one day I'm like,

17:52.772 --> 17:55.675
"What the hell is that
supposed to mean?"

17:55.708 --> 17:59.646
And he just smiles and says,
"You'll see."

18:02.815 --> 18:07.120
So we're in this shitty pile
of rocks outside of Kandahar.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.355
[gravel crunching]

18:08.388 --> 18:09.722
Slow down, Donny.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.658
We heard Solotov was nearby,

18:11.691 --> 18:15.228
but we'd been camped out
for, like, a week and nothing.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.597
- Could have exited
from either side of the compass.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.532
Besides, there's been nothing
on the infrared for a week.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.234
No man lays still for that long.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.370
- Yeah, you wanna
bet your life on that?

18:23.403 --> 18:26.239
- I'm a Marine.
I'm already betting my life.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.275
- Donny wanted to go south.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.244
It was faster.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.213
My gut said we go north.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.881
All right, go north.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.649
- You're the Nailer.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.618
- I told you not
to call me that.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.820
- I'd love it if somebody
would call me something cool.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.256
- You don't like Pork?
Pork's cool.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.925
- You've had three spotters.
You called all of them Pork.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.661
- It's easy to remember.

18:48.695 --> 18:49.929
- I don't even like bacon.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.199
All right, going first.
- No, no, no.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.367
I'm not making that call
to your mama.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.269
After me, Pork.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.770
[soft dramatic music]

18:57.804 --> 18:59.372
I heard it before I felt it.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.907
[gunshot]

19:00.940 --> 19:03.276
Ah!
[grunts]

19:03.310 --> 19:06.879
Solotov misjudged the wind,
but he...

19:06.913 --> 19:08.848
recalculated for a second shot.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.918
[distant voice]
Donny, no!

19:11.951 --> 19:13.853
[gunshot]

19:13.886 --> 19:15.588
He was dead before he fell.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.924
*

19:17.957 --> 19:19.826
Donny!

19:19.859 --> 19:26.633
*

19:26.666 --> 19:28.935
Donny was right.
[exhales deeply]

19:28.968 --> 19:32.905
A bullet is forever.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.942
He died
because I trusted my gut.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.747
- No, he didn't.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.982
He died
because Solotov shot him.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.418
That wasn't your fault.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.254
*

19:47.287 --> 19:48.955
Look...

19:48.988 --> 19:50.923
I love you,

19:50.957 --> 19:53.826
and I would never tell you
how to live your life,

19:53.860 --> 19:58.298
but maybe the best way
to put this behind you...

19:58.331 --> 20:00.233
is payback the favor.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.002
Punch Solotov's ticket.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.804
- And what if my instincts
are wrong?

20:04.837 --> 20:08.875
- Then you adjust your dope
and you fire again.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.879
*

20:12.912 --> 20:15.882
- I love it
when you talk sexy.

20:29.829 --> 20:29.996
.

20:30.029 --> 20:30.630
- Jack Payne, Bob Lee Swagger.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.968
Payne's Counter-terrorism.
He's our Solotov expert.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.671
Your paperwork is still moving,
but I don't wanna lose a day.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.441
We consider this a real threat.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.277
Motorcade stops there.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.846
Dignitaries and special visitors
at the rope line.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.348
- He'll shake a few hands?

20:48.381 --> 20:49.716
- Yeah, but we got that covered.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.318
Agents around him
and in the crowd.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.986
Consider it 15 seconds
from the Beast to the podium.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.389
- How are you protecting
his six?

20:56.423 --> 20:58.858
- Triple thick bulletproof
backdrop behind him.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.793
It'll stop anything.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.729
- He presents with
the Ukrainian president,

21:02.762 --> 21:04.297
then they take a tour inside.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.699
- Since Solotov warned you,
why not cancel?

21:06.733 --> 21:08.401
- [chuckles]
If we cancelled

21:08.435 --> 21:09.702
every credible threat we got,

21:09.736 --> 21:11.304
he'd never leave
the White House.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.072
They schedule him, I secure him.
That's the drill.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.676
- Even if we could move it,
we want Solotov,

21:16.709 --> 21:19.646
so if he's gonna be here,
let's figure out where.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.481
Now, Flashlight's route
won't be made public

21:21.514 --> 21:23.350
till the day before, so...

21:23.383 --> 21:24.751
- He doesn't need
to know the route.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.486
He knows where it ends.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.087
He's not gonna take a shot
at the president's limo.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.089
It might as well be a tank.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.025
Solotov's not gonna
take any chances.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.894
If he's hunting,

21:34.927 --> 21:37.364
he's gonna wait for his shot
and it'll be perfect.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.066
- And that's exactly why
I need you Bob Lee.

21:40.099 --> 21:42.469
You're the only one
who can neutralize him.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.371
I need a complete workup.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.105
Distances,
location possibilities,

21:46.138 --> 21:47.807
everything.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.041
We've got some nice range tech,
too.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.410
I can set you up.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.778
- Without firing his rifle,

21:51.811 --> 21:53.746
most of it'll be
educated guessing.

21:53.780 --> 21:54.981
- [scoffs]
Shit, Bob Lee,

21:55.014 --> 21:57.049
you're educated guess is
better than most.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.118
- We got these 12 hours ago.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.488
[soft dramatic music]

22:01.521 --> 22:04.123
Say hello to T. Solotov.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.359
That's the only known photo
of him,

22:06.393 --> 22:08.094
taken from a drone
over the Sudan.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.896
- Drone wasn't even

22:09.929 --> 22:11.431
The pilot was taking
the scenic route home,

22:11.464 --> 22:13.866

22:15.134 --> 22:17.804

22:17.837 --> 22:20.940
- Damn.
- We rebuilt it from the photo.

22:23.142 --> 22:25.812
We'll ship it to you.

and start shooting right away.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.416

Bob the Nailer, huh?

22:38.458 --> 22:42.028
He don't seem like much.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.997
- There was this, uh,
girls' school in Afghanistan,

22:45.031 --> 22:47.567
three miles south of Jupar.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.570
Bob Lee and his spotter were
alone doing recon when they saw

22:50.603 --> 22:53.105
a platoon of Taliban
bearing down on the school.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.908
We know what the Taliban does
to young girls in Afghanistan

22:55.942 --> 22:57.977
trying to get an education.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.580
Bob Lee and his spotter
could have simply moved on.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.114
No one would have ever known
they were there.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.850
Instead,

just hunted.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.862
all command level.

23:15.895 --> 23:16.996
And that girls' school?

23:17.029 --> 23:18.765
It's still there to this day.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.867
[chuckles]
Taliban won't go near it.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.570
They say it's cursed.

23:23.603 --> 23:27.474
Underestimate Bob Lee Swagger
at your own peril.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.542

he was Russian FSB?

24:25.898 --> 24:29.936
Sent over this morning
courtesy of Homeland.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.504
Russia said he was disavowed

24:31.538 --> 24:33.205
right around the time
you two met.

24:33.239 --> 24:36.509
He was handling security
for a small sect of the Bratva

Nadine, if it got out that the
FBI was helping a Russian spy...

24:42.982 --> 24:44.216
Homeland did us a favor.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.118
- Look, Voydian called me,

24:46.152 --> 24:48.655
said he had information
that was gonna get him killed.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.222
He said he would only
give it to me.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.091
He was desperate.

- Kissing ass.

Oh, and since you're so happy
to work with the Secret Service,

25:21.020 --> 25:23.222
they sent this.

and some .338 bullets too.

then make his way to the podium

where he'll speak for
approximately seven minutes.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.490
Might as well be seven years

32:04.523 --> 32:06.525
Knowing exactly where
the president will be standing

gives Solotov an advantage
that's almost unbeatable.

It's gonna have your team
doubling, tripling security,

32:12.198 --> 32:14.266
covering every angle of attack,

32:14.300 --> 32:16.502
which is why he's not gonna
take the shot there.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.037
He's gonna take the shot here,

32:18.070 --> 32:19.371
the moment
he gets out of his limo.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.407
- No, Swagger, that--
that's not possible.

22 inches in circumference.

32:28.414 --> 32:31.150
The gap from his limo
to the rope line is 3 yards.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.185
President's gait makes that
2 1/2 steps.

32:33.219 --> 32:36.288
At 1,000 yards, the shooter has
almost two full seconds

32:36.322 --> 32:37.523
to make that shot.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.026
It is the best location
hands down.

[bullet whistles]

32:41.327 --> 32:43.062

32:43.095 --> 32:45.264

take that shot.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.167

32:56.275 --> 32:58.277
- The same way Solotov will,

32:58.310 --> 33:00.212
by doing my homework.

33:00.246 --> 33:04.183
On top of this parking garage,
at 1,400 yards,

33:04.216 --> 33:06.185
he has not obstructions
to the motorcade stop,

33:06.218 --> 33:08.354
but he's gotta shoot fast.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.389
He can pre-rig the mount
to the exact height

33:10.422 --> 33:13.192
as long as he stops
in the right spot.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.433
- No way he's getting away.
We've got air, ground.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.801
He wouldn't get ten feet.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.804
- And Solotov has no history
of mobile hits.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.339

about Solotov,

he knows ten times about you.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.445
he's a master sniper.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.381
The guy has worked
in the worst conditions

33:35.414 --> 33:37.783
mankind has ever created,
under all kinds of heavy fire

33:37.816 --> 33:39.451
with one goal:

33:39.485 --> 33:41.487
kill his target.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.389
He knows the window
around the event,

33:43.422 --> 33:44.623
he knows
the Secret Service schedule,

33:44.656 --> 33:46.358
he knows the perimeters,

33:46.392 --> 33:48.327
and he knows the exact moment
to take the shot,

33:48.360 --> 33:50.062
and he's gonna
take it from here.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.835
line of sight to the president
for a full three seconds,

33:56.868 --> 33:59.838
wide enough so the wind won't be
a surprise.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.108
Got Solotov here shooting low,

34:02.141 --> 34:04.210
sunlight behind him
so the target's well lit.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.378
He'll be out the door
before you hear the shot.

34:06.412 --> 34:09.081
- But he won't shoot
through glass.

34:09.115 --> 34:11.117
It'll screw with trajectory.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.519
- Small wired charges...

34:13.552 --> 34:16.088
will break the window
timed to the shot.

34:16.122 --> 34:18.524
No one'll hear the glass
until it's too late.

34:18.557 --> 34:21.660

34:28.567 --> 34:30.636
That's how it's gonna go down.

34:34.273 --> 34:37.143
- The president appreciates
you jumping in.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.845
If you're available, I know he'd
like to thank you personally.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.647
- That won't be necessary,
Captain.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.315
I'm happy to help.
- Trust me,

34:43.349 --> 34:44.550
He won't take "no"
for an answer.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.618
Payne, get your team ready.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.588
You guys can prep here.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.890
I'm gonna get
the man who shot you, Bob Lee.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.659
- Yes, sir.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.903
- Something wrong?

35:04.936 --> 35:07.539
- No, I must have
left the light on.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.575
Here.

35:09.608 --> 35:13.111
- Yep.
- I'm gonna go turn it off.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.706
- Hey, did you get
my Charlie list?

36:14.740 --> 36:17.743
- Three names.
Passed 'em on last night.

36:19.945 --> 36:21.247
Something wrong?

36:21.280 --> 36:23.482
- Yeah, there was one guy
on the list,

36:23.515 --> 36:25.484
ex-Marine, seemed off.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.653
- I didn't see any marine.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.255
- It's just that he was--

36:29.288 --> 36:31.323
it was odd that he was
being considered a Charlie.

36:31.357 --> 36:34.860
His record was completely clean,
sparkling.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.895
- Yeah.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.665
- Anyway,
you going to this thing?

36:39.698 --> 36:41.833
- No, I've met the president.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.736
Um, they say they need bodies
on the outer perimeter.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.905
You wanna help out?
- I have a bunch of stuff--

36:46.938 --> 36:49.708
- I'll forward this to you,
okay?

36:49.741 --> 36:52.344
You can close the door
on the way out.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.040
- Try to relax a little.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.042
It's exciting just to be here.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.444
*

37:25.477 --> 37:27.546
- Let's move back a little.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.780
- If we do that,
we're gonna be sitting

37:28.814 --> 37:31.383
on our front porch watching.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.319
- I think we can see better
from over there.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.820
Come on.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.529
- Nah, something's wrong.

Hello?
- It's Payne.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.770
He's not here.
- What?

38:24.803 --> 38:26.004
- He's not here.

38:26.037 --> 38:29.074
No Solotov, no gun, no nothing.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.542

- What?

38:39.451 --> 38:40.552
- Go, just go!
- No, Bob Lee,

38:40.586 --> 38:42.554
where are you going?

38:42.588 --> 38:46.024
[suspenseful music]

38:46.057 --> 38:47.593
- I made a mistake.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.895
He's gonna use charges
to drop the flag.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.063
He's in location "A."
You gotta call Johnson.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.832
