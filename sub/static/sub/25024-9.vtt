00:15.015 --> 00:16.474
[theme music playing]

00:24.733 --> 00:25.775
[roars]

00:40.790 --> 00:42.250
[roaring]

00:52.802 --> 00:56.139
All this time,
she was beneath our very feet.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.349
Eldritch Queen,

00:58.433 --> 01:01.853
you will be freed
from this wretched prison.

01:03.021 --> 01:07.484
And together, we will bring forth
the Eternal Night.

01:08.026 --> 01:13.531
[in Trollish]
Make the day night, the sun darkness,

01:13.615 --> 01:18.912
and me King.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.165
[grunting]

01:25.668 --> 01:26.669
[Usurna] My lord!

01:26.753 --> 01:28.004
[grunting continues]

01:36.095 --> 01:39.224
"Only human hands may wield."

01:39.307 --> 01:44.062
But how are we to find a human
who can speak the Trollish incantation?

01:44.729 --> 01:47.607
Find me an Impure!

01:50.860 --> 01:53.947
Mm. Fascinating.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.159
Mm.

01:58.993 --> 02:02.539
But how do you know the light goes out
when you close the door?

02:04.415 --> 02:06.793
I never expected Merlin to be in my house.

02:06.876 --> 02:10.839
[Claire chuckles] You've had trolls,
goblins, and changelings here.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.424
-Why not a wizard?
-Merlin, the Immortal.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.218
What an honor. [gasps]

02:15.301 --> 02:18.388
Allow me to introduce myself.
Waltolomew Stricklander.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.722
Well, Strickler for short.

02:19.806 --> 02:23.226
-I've been mentoring the Trollhunter.
-Spare me the life story.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.479
Now and forever, changeling.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.899
So Gunmar stole your staff.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.236
Isn't that all he needs
to make the, um, the, the--?

02:33.319 --> 02:34.904
-The Eternal Night, Mom.
-[sniffs]

02:34.988 --> 02:36.906
Yes, the Eternal Night.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.867
Fear not, Mother of Jim.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.162
When I designed my staff,
I put in a safeguard.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.122
See? We're in good hands.

02:44.205 --> 02:47.792
[chuckles] Then again,
no safeguard is a guarantee.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.753
It's been centuries since I've eaten.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.090
Metalface here was lucky
I didn't eat him back in the cave.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.177
[chuckling] He's joking, right?

02:58.261 --> 03:01.389
Mm, not really. Time is of the essence.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.850
Take me to the nearest blacksmith at once.

03:04.809 --> 03:08.897
We have a couple of tools
and some old Christmas decorations.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.940
Will that work? Or...

03:11.024 --> 03:14.652
-What are you making, exactly?
-It's none of your concern now.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.697
No forge? No grindstone?

03:17.780 --> 03:20.033
-Not even a bellows?
-No.

03:20.116 --> 03:23.703
But Jimbo has a garage door. Check it out!

03:24.120 --> 03:25.038
[Toby] Open.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.040
Close.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.458
Open.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.627
What's it do next? Close.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.546
[sighs] This will have to do.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.049
Well, when you said
you put in a safeguard,

03:36.382 --> 03:39.302
how long do safeguards
typically guard... safely?

03:39.385 --> 03:41.846
-Yeah, are we talking weeks? Years?
-[metal clicking]

03:41.930 --> 03:43.973
[Jim grunts]

03:44.057 --> 03:47.685
Depends on Gunmar's cleverness.
A few hours.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.229
But you can stop him, right?

03:49.771 --> 03:52.148
-I have lost most of my magic.
-[Jim sighs]

03:52.232 --> 03:55.193
But this old bucket knows a few spells.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.321
I need you to acquire a few items first.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.781
[Jim] What sort of items?

03:59.864 --> 04:02.492
I'm sure nothing too difficult to gather.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.453
Lend me your quill.
I shall write you a list.

04:05.536 --> 04:09.374
-[chuckles] We're fresh out of quills.
-Can you text it?

04:09.540 --> 04:10.583
Eh...

04:11.000 --> 04:11.876
[school bell rings]

04:11.960 --> 04:14.545
Blinky and Aaarrrgghh!!!
are collecting a bunch of these,

04:14.629 --> 04:16.130
which leaves three things for us.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.384
-'Kay. What's first on Merlin's list?
-An Antramonstrum shell.

04:19.466 --> 04:21.594
Strickler thinks he has one
in his old office.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.014
Ugh, I'm having flashbacks
of Fart Cloud McDoomsday.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.099
Let's make this quick.

04:26.724 --> 04:27.600
[Mary] C-bomb!

04:27.684 --> 04:28.977
Where have you been?

04:29.060 --> 04:31.396
The Battle of the Bands
is right around the corner

04:31.479 --> 04:33.398
and you've missed, like, every rehearsal.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.442
[sighs] I know. It's been super crazy.

04:36.734 --> 04:40.446
And what's this I hear about your parents
in a play with Darci's dad?

04:40.738 --> 04:42.490
-I thought theater was your bag.
-Shh.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.034
It's a real crazy story.
But here's what happened...

04:46.077 --> 04:47.912
Uhl's not much for redecorating.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.041
-Got the key?
-Strickler fixed it so we can use it.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.876
Abracadabra.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.634
[thudding on door]

05:01.718 --> 05:02.760
-[shuddering]
-Hide!

05:06.389 --> 05:09.058
-What are you doing in my office?
-Señor Uhl!

05:09.267 --> 05:12.895
I mean, uh, Interim Principal Señor Uhl.
[laughs, inhales]

05:12.979 --> 05:17.775
Ah, it's so hard to keep track.
I'm just, uh, looking for... guidance!

05:18.234 --> 05:21.529
Ah. Oh, well, I'm glad you came to see me.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.906
I'm worried about your attendance.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.035
-You've missed 43 days.
-Shut the door!

05:27.118 --> 05:28.328
Forty-three days, you say?

05:28.411 --> 05:31.581
[Señor Uhl] I am afraid
because of this lack of commitment,

05:31.664 --> 05:34.042
you may have to repeat
your sophomore year.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.419
Hold me back. Wait, what?

05:36.502 --> 05:37.837
He's gonna hear that...

05:38.254 --> 05:40.673
is what my mom will say about my father.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.426
Whom I never see. That bum.

05:45.428 --> 05:49.265
You never thought you could be separated
from your peers, did you, Mr. Lake?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.809
But actions have consequences.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.688
Isn't there anything I can do?
Like play the piano or sing a song?

05:56.230 --> 05:59.734
♪ Please, Uhl, I want to stay in school ♪

05:59.817 --> 06:01.944
♪ School, Uhl ♪

06:02.028 --> 06:04.614
♪ I'm such a fool, Uhl ♪

06:04.697 --> 06:07.241
You cannot sing your way out of this,
Mr. Lake.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.412
-But there is one thing you can do.
-Phew. I mean, there is?

06:11.496 --> 06:14.082
We have two students
who are not from these parts.

06:14.165 --> 06:17.627
They're having some difficulty fitting in.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.338
They are a little strange.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.467
We'll fake illness.
I've seen it work for others in gym class.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.844
Aah. My leg. It hurts.

06:26.928 --> 06:31.766
Oh, my stomach hurts. [coughs]
My throat hurts. [coughs, grunts]

06:31.849 --> 06:33.184
Feeling better? Hmm?

06:33.267 --> 06:34.560
[Señor Uhl grunts]

06:34.936 --> 06:38.606
Show them around,
make them feel more at home in Arcadia.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.275
And I could be compelled
to look the other way

06:41.359 --> 06:43.569
regarding your absences.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.029
Maybe.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.950
[chuckles] If there's anyone that wants
you to look the other way, it's me.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.161
Jim! You made it out okay.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.957
And with two strangers
I've never met before.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.625
[Toby] Wait, are they on the list?

06:57.708 --> 07:01.254
Meet Aja and Krel.
I think they're foreign exchange students.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.840
Principal Uhl says,
if I want to pass "sophomore year,"

07:03.923 --> 07:05.341
I have to show them around

07:05.424 --> 07:09.345
this wonderful, ordinary world of Arcadia.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.764
You do know
Arcadia is not a world, right?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.058
-[metal clanging]
-It is barely a municipality.

07:14.142 --> 07:18.020
Amazing! You have robot teeth.
Can I touch them?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.272
-Aah.
-Hmm.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.273
Fascinating.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.650
Uh, who are these people, Jimbo?

07:22.733 --> 07:24.902
Better yet, where did they come from?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.946
-[both] Cantaloupia.
-[Claire] Cantaloupia?

07:27.029 --> 07:30.825
Yeah, Can-ta-loupia.
From the Latin conjugation cantaloupali.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.536
It is a very small island
off the coast of Santo Puerco.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.790
-What? You didn't learn that at school?
-Uh, guess I missed that day.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.293
-Mm. That much is clear.
-[grunts]

07:40.376 --> 07:43.838
Don't you remember we have
some important errands to run? ASAP?

07:43.921 --> 07:47.884
Yeah, but I also remember
I need to graduate sometime this century.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.803
So let's show them
our totally normal town. [gasps]

07:50.887 --> 07:53.222
Lively! [laughs]

07:53.848 --> 07:58.728
You know, lively.
Cool. Awesome. Outstanding.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.731
-Lively!
-Lively. Totally.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.567
-And very odd.
-[school bell ringing]

08:04.650 --> 08:06.903
[indistinct chattering]

08:07.570 --> 08:09.822
Nice to have you back, Miss Nomura.

08:21.751 --> 08:25.004
-[classical music plays]
-[Nomura humming]

08:35.972 --> 08:37.015
[grunts]

08:37.975 --> 08:39.268
Hello, Nomura.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.811
What do you want?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.563
I want what Gunmar wants.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.650
Fortunately for you, he wants you alive.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.778
I'm not going back to him
to be tortured for entertainment.

08:48.861 --> 08:52.782
Oh, well, this is different.
Now Gunmar needs you.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.910
Only human hands
can wield the Staff of Avalon.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.995
And he has chosen you for that honor.

08:58.079 --> 09:01.040
Come quietly,
and you shall be rewarded greatly.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.960
I was never one to go quietly. [grunts]

09:06.128 --> 09:07.880
-[pants]
-Capture her!

09:08.089 --> 09:09.465
Alive!

09:11.509 --> 09:12.677
[growling]

09:12.760 --> 09:14.762
[grunting]

09:20.893 --> 09:22.144
[grunting]

09:32.572 --> 09:33.406
Just imagine.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.741
Morgana freed by your hand.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.327
You would be the greatest changeling
who'd ever lived.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.453
Never!

09:40.288 --> 09:41.289
[yelling]

09:43.624 --> 09:45.459
[grunts]

09:48.504 --> 09:50.798
Impures were made to serve.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.221
[grunts] Stop, you fools!

09:57.305 --> 09:58.639
[both grunting]

09:58.723 --> 10:01.225
Tell them to let the chains go!

10:01.309 --> 10:05.521
I won't. Even if you kill me,
they will never let you escape.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.440
There's nothing you can do.

10:07.523 --> 10:08.524
[Nomura grunts]

10:09.400 --> 10:11.277
There is one thing.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.822
Now, let's not be hasty.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.533
You're a bright changeling.
You would never--

10:17.617 --> 10:19.535
You're right. I wouldn't.

10:20.661 --> 10:21.912
[grunts]

10:31.339 --> 10:34.008
No! No! No!

10:34.800 --> 10:38.679
Amazing. We love rooms that move.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.097
Don't we, little brother?

10:40.181 --> 10:42.975
I am so bored.
[exhales] Where are we going again?

10:43.059 --> 10:46.479
Someplace not boring! A...

10:46.562 --> 10:50.066
A super-secret teen center! [chuckles]

10:50.149 --> 10:51.609
Five stories underground?

10:51.692 --> 10:54.153
Yeah, 'cause teens
are so loud and crazy here.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.572
No parents allowed.
So no telling, you two.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.158
No. No, no, no, no. [laughs]

10:59.241 --> 11:01.869
We are excellent at keeping secrets.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.829
You have no idea.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.295
[gasps] What are those?

11:11.379 --> 11:14.173
Ooh! Looks like human bones
with bite marks.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.759
[chuckles]
Now things are getting interesting.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.552
-Teen center?
-Let's see you justify

11:18.636 --> 11:20.221
how we're supposed to be collecting

11:20.304 --> 11:23.557
the femur of a changeling
and everything else on Merlin's list.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.477
We, uh, raged here pretty hard last time.

11:26.769 --> 11:30.564
Guess we haven't cleaned up
from the Halloween party. Oops!

11:30.648 --> 11:32.066
[Toby chuckles]

11:32.858 --> 11:36.654
You do realize your teen center
does not have any teens in it, right?

11:36.737 --> 11:39.782
-Where is the house music?
-[blows]

11:39.865 --> 11:43.035
-That's not a harmonica, you know.
-Oh, we just love music!

11:43.119 --> 11:47.415
-Krel is a totally lively disc jockey.
-Oh, you don't say?

11:54.505 --> 11:58.092
[gasps] Ay, yai, yai.
Finally! Something not boring!

11:58.175 --> 12:00.094
[keyboard beeping]

12:04.849 --> 12:07.143
-Got the bones. What's left?
-Just the last thing.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.729
-"Lightning in a bottle"?
-You mean like in a metaphor, right?

12:10.813 --> 12:14.233
-It would be impossible to catch.
-Ha! You think that's hard?

12:14.316 --> 12:16.235
You should see the ones I gave Blinky.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.236
[growling]

12:17.319 --> 12:19.196
Just a drop.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.114
[gas burbles]

12:20.197 --> 12:22.199
-Oh.
-Careful.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.617
-[squeaking]
-Ew.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.871
Careful. [straining] Careful.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.914
[forceful gas burbling]

12:28.998 --> 12:31.167
[gagging, retching]

12:31.250 --> 12:33.753
-[groans]
-Guys, we're down one.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.337
Aja, where's Krel?

12:35.421 --> 12:37.047
-Krel?
-Krel?

12:37.131 --> 12:39.133
[lively music playing]

12:53.731 --> 12:55.774
You people really should be moving it.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.123
How did he turn the Janus Order
into a rave?

13:11.207 --> 13:13.125
Ah, Cantaloupia tech.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.211
Man, Europe gets all the cool tech first.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.762
[grunting]

13:24.845 --> 13:25.763
No, no, no.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.558
-I so enjoy moving picture stories!
-[Toby] Turn it off, Jimbo!

13:29.642 --> 13:32.228
I'm trying. [grunts]

13:32.311 --> 13:33.229
Try harder.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.648
Huh, looks scary. What is it called?

13:35.731 --> 13:37.024
-Gun Robot.
-Trollhunters.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.150
I mean, Trollhunters.

13:40.027 --> 13:43.697
Here's an idea. Who wants to see the house
of Arcadia's very own councilwoman?

13:43.781 --> 13:46.242
-Yeah, we should go.
<span style="style_2"/>-Ay, yai, yai. [sighs]

13:48.577 --> 13:50.746
[clattering]

13:50.829 --> 13:54.041
[Merlin] Ow! This infernal contraption!

13:54.625 --> 13:55.751
Shut the door, please.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.296
Ugh! You'll clean that mess up
when you're done.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.923
[laughs] No.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.633
[Nomura] You've reached my cell.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.093
-You know what to do.
-[sighs]

14:04.176 --> 14:05.636
Nomura still isn't answering?

14:05.719 --> 14:08.764
[grunts] I should have gone with her.
It's dangerous to be alone.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.725
-Uh, maybe she turned off her phone.
-I have to find her.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.646
Wait, wait. Uh, I'll drive.
You said it's dangerous alone.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.106
We're in this together.

14:19.024 --> 14:19.942
[clears throat]

14:21.819 --> 14:24.613
And this is where the leader of our town,

14:24.697 --> 14:26.866
Councilwoman Nuñez, makes enchiladas.

14:26.949 --> 14:27.867
Fascinating.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.744
Hmm. Does that make you
a council-princess?

14:30.828 --> 14:33.080
They won't tell you this
on the normal tour,

14:33.163 --> 14:36.083
but I hear she likes spinach
with salsa verde and--

14:36.166 --> 14:37.668
A question if I may.

14:37.751 --> 14:41.046
How do you know the light goes off
when you close the door?

14:41.922 --> 14:45.676
Fascinating. Intriguing.
But I do not trust it.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.469
-You and Merlin both.
-[both] Who?

14:47.553 --> 14:48.387
Uh...

14:48.804 --> 14:52.766
How's it going up there?
I'm really running out of things to show.

14:52.850 --> 14:53.893
[Toby] A little longer.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.896
Who wants to count how many books
Councilwoman Nuñez has?

14:56.979 --> 15:00.858
Tobes, this is ridiculous.
There's not a cloud in sight.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.235
[Toby] Weather says
two-percent chance of drizzle.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.987
You just gotta believe, dude.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.240
Son of a-- [grunts]

15:08.324 --> 15:10.159
This is my fifth phone.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.952
Jim, this is never gonna work!

15:12.036 --> 15:15.456
It has to. Unless you have a better way
to capture lightning in a bottle?

15:15.539 --> 15:19.251
Did I hear you say you're trying
to capture lightning in a bottle?

15:19.335 --> 15:21.754
Oh! [chuckles] We used to play
that game as children.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.298
No, no, you don't understand. Lightning.

15:24.381 --> 15:27.509
Like, a thousand volts
of electricity in a jar.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.305
Actually, it's closer
to several hundred million volts.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.932
And that's not the way you do it.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.768
Seriously,
you know how to catch lightning?

15:36.852 --> 15:39.772
Sí. You obviously don't, but we do.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.943
So that's some sort of super capacitator?

15:44.026 --> 15:46.528
Capacitor. I made it from the microwave.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.447
It can hold sudden bursts of energy.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.574
Have you never been to physics class?

15:50.658 --> 15:53.953
-Well, I've missed 43 days.
-Uh, we're more into Earth sciences.

15:54.036 --> 15:57.081
Anyway, how we gonna get
a bajillion volts of lightning in there?

15:57.164 --> 15:58.082
[murmuring]

15:58.165 --> 15:59.416
Are you seeing this?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.044
I think she just hacked
into the Arcadia power grid.

16:02.127 --> 16:05.005
Of course. That's where the locals
store their power.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.634
Hmm. Do you think 200 million volts
will be enough?

16:08.717 --> 16:09.927
[both] Um...

16:10.010 --> 16:11.428
-Sounds good.
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.473
-Yeah, that's about right.
-Is this technically legal?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.184
Define "legal."

16:18.102 --> 16:22.439
They're geniuses, Jimbo.
Weirdo geniuses. That's the best kind.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.944
-Mm, boop. We're all set.
-[computer beeping]

16:27.027 --> 16:30.781
I've redirected the power
to one corner at longitude 36 degrees.

16:30.864 --> 16:34.243
Uh, fifth and Main in T-minus 15-- minutes

16:34.326 --> 16:36.245
and 30 seconds

16:36.328 --> 16:39.206
-and approximately 71 milliseconds.
-[laughs]

16:40.082 --> 16:42.751
All we need now is a metal
to act as a conductor.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.087
Toby, I need your robot teeth.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.672
[chuckles]

16:47.172 --> 16:49.633
[inhales] Jim? Stop these weirdo geniuses.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.261
I think I have something else we can use.

17:00.060 --> 17:04.397
-Something's wrong. Stay close.
-What happened here?

17:05.190 --> 17:06.525
[screams]

17:13.781 --> 17:14.616
[clears throat]

17:15.075 --> 17:19.829
Curious. First, metal teeth.
Now, metal clothes.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.708
And you always tell me
we are the ones who have to be normal?

17:23.083 --> 17:24.542
Lively.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.421
What is the power source?

17:27.628 --> 17:30.758
Um, I don't know.
Just a standard safety suit.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.926
Uh, yeah. Safety first.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.473
Safety? [scoffs]
You're wearing metal in a lightning storm.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.477
-Hup-two. Better hurry.
-Good luck.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.943
Redirect in T-minus ten seconds.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.323
Yep, just another boring day
in our perfectly normal town.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.451
And three...

17:58.160 --> 18:00.412
two, one!

18:11.507 --> 18:14.176
-[all] Oh.
-No, that's not good.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.304
-Nomura.
-Where is she? Is she okay?

18:18.222 --> 18:19.098
I don't know.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.767
But we're not. We need to go.

18:25.687 --> 18:27.689
-[screams]
-Run!

18:36.156 --> 18:36.990
Walt?

18:38.575 --> 18:41.203
Hang on to me and take off your glasses.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.456
-[stammers] Why? What are you going to do?
-This!

18:50.295 --> 18:51.880
-Oh!
-It's all right.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.465
-I've got you.
-[gasps]

18:53.549 --> 18:58.303
-Walter, you can fly?
-Yes, I'm a keen swimmer, too.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.473
We need to warn Jim!

19:02.516 --> 19:05.352
[Stalkling growling, screeching]

19:06.770 --> 19:10.065
-What is that?
-Trouble. Hold on!

19:10.149 --> 19:11.567
What do you think I'm doing?

19:12.484 --> 19:13.485
[Strickler] Aah!

19:36.258 --> 19:38.093
[Barbara screams]

19:38.468 --> 19:40.012
Hold on!

19:42.222 --> 19:43.056
[grunts]

19:43.140 --> 19:45.893
[car alarm blaring]

19:46.935 --> 19:49.396
-Lose him in the forest.
-Doctor's orders.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.199
It's working! Aah!

20:09.082 --> 20:10.500
Take them to Gunmar.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.170
The changeling will serve him once more.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.132
[Claire] Don't drop it.
If that jar breaks, we're all fried.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.468
-Do you wanna hold it?
-This is us.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.012
You want us to walk you home?
Jim can light the way.

20:22.095 --> 20:25.807
It is completely unnecessary.
Our domicile is but a few blocks away.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.560
Thank you for the tour. It was--

20:28.644 --> 20:31.688
-[all] Lively!
-I was going to say "legal."

20:31.772 --> 20:34.441
And we'd like to thank you.
You really helped us out.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.860
-You guys are out of this world.
-Precisely.

20:36.944 --> 20:41.949
-Maybe we'll see you around this summer.
-Sure, maybe at the "teen center."

20:45.661 --> 20:49.081
We're home, Mom! Merlin?
Got the stuff you needed.

20:49.164 --> 20:52.209
-[sniffs] What's that smell?
-[Blinky] We're in the garage!

20:52.751 --> 20:54.711
Ah, Master Jim.

20:54.795 --> 20:58.090
It appears your little excursion
was just as fruitful as our own.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.801
My Vespa? Aah!

21:01.176 --> 21:04.012
[groaning]

21:04.096 --> 21:06.223
-Oh. [retches]
-What did you do?

21:06.306 --> 21:09.726
I put it to much better use.
This one is for Tobias.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.689
[Toby] What?! We get armor, too?

21:13.772 --> 21:17.693
I've been waiting my whole life for this!
So cool! So cool! Look how shiny it is.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.987
Oh, my gosh! Is that a shield?
Totally a shield.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.614
[Merlin] And this one is for Lady Claire.

21:27.869 --> 21:28.704
Oh. [chuckles]

21:29.246 --> 21:30.330
Wow.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.293
-Holy guacamole.
-I like mine better. [chuckles]

21:34.376 --> 21:38.588
-That's surprisingly nice of you, Merlin.
-Quick query.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.717
If we've been collecting items
for a spell to thwart Gunmar,

21:41.800 --> 21:44.261
then why would they require armor?

21:44.344 --> 21:45.470
A spell?

21:45.554 --> 21:49.516
You thought we would stop Gunmar
and Angor Rot without going to war?

21:49.599 --> 21:51.476
Do you have sand for brains?

21:51.560 --> 21:52.811
[Jim] Wait, a war?

21:52.894 --> 21:57.899
Once freed, Morgana will attempt
to bring forth the Eternal Night.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.318
We must prepare.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.987
Sounds like you're saying
you're not going to stop Gunmar

22:02.070 --> 22:03.196
from freeing that witch.

22:03.280 --> 22:08.577
Oh, did I not make myself clear?
I'm not here to stop Gunmar.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.496
I'm here to kill Morgana.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.250
