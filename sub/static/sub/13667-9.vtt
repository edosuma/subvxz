Fiscus, I can't tell you how
to live, but I can sure as hell
tell you this.

27:00.487 --> 27:02.689
If I see you carrying that
gun around this hospital again,

27:02.756 --> 27:04.691
you're not gonna finish
your residency here.

27:04.758 --> 27:06.994
Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.029
Get rid of it.

27:21.508 --> 27:23.811
So, was he a genuine cowboy?
Oh, yeah.

27:23.877 --> 27:25.979
From lubbock, texas.
Needless to say,

27:26.046 --> 27:29.283
he was very happy
when I told him that
he wasn't damaged for life.

27:29.349 --> 27:33.587
And he said that from now on,
all he ever wants
is a woman doctor.

27:33.654 --> 27:36.824
Ooh. You must've handled him
very gently.

27:36.890 --> 27:39.960
Hot, hot, hot, Hot.
Careful.

27:40.027 --> 27:42.429
Dr. Craig gave me this lecture
about being careful
with my hands.

27:42.496 --> 27:45.365
He wants me to stop
playing handball.
I love handball.

27:45.432 --> 27:48.602
I've been playing handball
since I was 10 years old.

27:48.669 --> 27:50.637
It's the only sport
I can really call my Own.

27:50.704 --> 27:54.641
Dr. Kaplan told me the other day
that if I was really serious
about becoming a surgeon,

27:54.708 --> 27:56.777
I'd give up
my carpentry work.

27:56.844 --> 28:00.948
I didn't know
you were into carpentry.
Yeah. My husband and I both.

28:01.014 --> 28:03.016
Let me ask you something.

28:03.083 --> 28:05.753
What kind of a doctor
would you be if you
couldn't be a surgeon?

28:05.819 --> 28:07.755
[ chuckles ]
I wouldn't want to be a doctor.

28:07.821 --> 28:09.790
I'd go back to california
and Get my M.B.A.

28:09.857 --> 28:12.292
You're kidding.
No. I want to be a surgeon.

28:12.359 --> 28:14.428
I just really hate
giving up handball.

28:14.495 --> 28:17.898
You could do it on the Sly.
Not with Craig around.
He'd know.

28:17.965 --> 28:21.568
So every time
Ralph's tray comes back,
the food hasn't been touched?

28:21.635 --> 28:24.671
Not only that,
the plastic Silverware's
always missing.

28:24.738 --> 28:28.909
And the paper cup
and the milk carton
and the place mats.

28:28.976 --> 28:31.845
What's Ralph doing
with All that garbage?

28:31.912 --> 28:34.982
He's eating it.
Ohh.

28:37.384 --> 28:39.386
Give her to me.
She swallowed
some Mothballs.

28:39.453 --> 28:41.955
Come on.
I'll take care of her.
[ whining ]

28:43.624 --> 28:45.559
White's kid.
She ate some Mothballs.

28:45.626 --> 28:49.830
Get her vitals,
Get 15 C.C.'s serum of ipecac
and a ton of fluid.

28:49.897 --> 28:52.032
I don't know how many she ate
or how long ago.

28:52.099 --> 28:54.635
Did you bring
the box with you?
No, I didn't have time.

28:54.701 --> 28:56.670
Do you know what kind
of mothballs they were?

28:56.737 --> 28:59.973
I think the box was red.
No, it was green.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.609
I don't re--
Okay, okay,
listen to me, Myra. Listen.

29:02.676 --> 29:05.679
Any of your neighbors
have the key?
Uh, mrs. Kelk Does.

29:05.746 --> 29:09.116
Fine. I want you to call her.
Luther. You call her, okay?
Uh-Huh.

29:09.183 --> 29:11.118
Luther, go with her.
She's gonna call her neighbor.

29:11.185 --> 29:15.055
You get the toxin
on the side of the box, okay?

29:18.292 --> 29:20.427
Let's see here.
Did you get it down?
Not yet.

29:20.494 --> 29:22.696
Okay, let me have this here.
Come on, honey.

29:22.763 --> 29:24.698
You're gonna have to take this
if you want it to stop hurting.

29:24.765 --> 29:27.401
It's on the floor
in the closet.
What happened?

29:27.468 --> 29:29.470
She got into some mothballs.
What?

29:29.536 --> 29:31.505
I was upstairs lying down
for a few minutes.

29:31.572 --> 29:33.474
Come on now.
I know.

29:33.540 --> 29:35.709
Get a set of Vitals.
Get an n.G. Tube down her.

29:35.776 --> 29:37.711
We're flushing with Ipecac.
Start the I.V.

29:37.778 --> 29:40.314
Wait. You stay right there.
I said we're getting a flush.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.416
<i>I want an n.G. Tube.
We don't need it.</i>

29:42.483 --> 29:44.418
There could be naphthalene
in those things.

29:44.485 --> 29:47.521
She's gonna throw up either way.
I've already gone this way,

29:47.588 --> 29:49.990
So just go sit down somewhere
and take it easy.

29:50.057 --> 29:51.992
The neighbor found the box,
and it was parad--

29:52.059 --> 29:54.695
dichlorobenzene?
Okay, fine.
Right.

29:54.762 --> 29:56.730
<i>Not napthalene.</i>

30:04.972 --> 30:07.474
Here we go now.
One more big gulp.

30:07.541 --> 30:09.510
There we go.

30:11.211 --> 30:13.213
Peter?
She's gonna be all right.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.182
Oh!

30:17.284 --> 30:21.922
<i>[ Ralph ] I'll be right out.
Take your time, Ralph.
Take your time.</i>

30:32.332 --> 30:34.635
What did you want
to see me about, Hugh?

30:37.471 --> 30:40.074
Ah, I see you found
my compost Heap.

30:42.876 --> 30:46.980
Why are you saving
all this stuff?
Look around.

30:47.047 --> 30:50.117
You'd have to be blind not
to see the mounds of garbage.

30:50.184 --> 30:53.020
The Public gardens
look like a dump.

30:53.087 --> 30:56.423
For years,
people have been talking about
what a mess the ecology is.

30:56.490 --> 31:00.561
But if they really tasted
some trash, they'd see.

31:00.627 --> 31:03.497
- See what?
- When I was small,

31:03.564 --> 31:07.568
the air was clean,
and when it rained like this,
green things grew.

31:07.634 --> 31:11.572
Now the leaves are covered
with a white coat of acid,
and the soil can't breathe.

31:11.638 --> 31:14.374
<i>Pollution's making us
all sick, Hugh.</i>

31:14.441 --> 31:17.177
<i>It's not only us.
The fish are full of mercury.</i>

31:17.244 --> 31:19.947
You go to any pond,
they'll tell you.

31:20.013 --> 31:23.617
- and dying. We're dying.
- Ralph, this has--

31:23.684 --> 31:26.520
No, no, I've seen it.
I've seen it from the sky.

31:26.587 --> 31:29.823
Cities the size of an eyeball
staring at me and winking...

31:29.890 --> 31:32.259
and crying
big drops of Tears.

31:32.326 --> 31:36.897
Ralph, you gotta Stop
eating garbage.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.635
Do you think it's best?

31:42.669 --> 31:45.739
- All right then. I will.
- Good.

31:49.410 --> 31:54.848
- I'll get someone
to clean this up.
- No, no, no. I'll do it myself.

31:54.915 --> 31:56.884
Don't bother.

31:58.719 --> 32:02.890
You know how the turkey vulture
deals with her young?

32:02.956 --> 32:06.593
She leads them with her beak
to the edge of the nest...

32:06.660 --> 32:10.230
and then, quite literally,
shoves them off.

32:10.297 --> 32:13.834
The strong ones fly up
into the sun.

32:13.901 --> 32:17.971
â™ª Off we go into
the wild blue Yonder â™ª

32:18.038 --> 32:22.309
â™ª climbing high into the sun â™ªâ™ª

32:22.376 --> 32:25.345
â™ªâ™ª [ humming ]

32:35.155 --> 32:37.091
Oh, hi, Jack.

32:37.157 --> 32:39.426
Megan's gonna be okay.
Oh, good.

32:39.493 --> 32:43.263
She's been vomiting,
which I guess is what
they wanted to happen.

32:43.330 --> 32:45.966
Phil says I can take her home
in a little while.

32:48.268 --> 32:50.671
She was home with a cold,

32:50.738 --> 32:55.743
and I'd been picking up
after her and Timothy all day.

32:55.809 --> 32:58.512
I got so tired,
just exhausted.

32:58.579 --> 33:02.416
So I sat Megan down
with a puzzle,
and I put Timothy in his crib,

33:02.483 --> 33:06.620
and I went upstairs
to take a nap for 20 minutes.

33:06.687 --> 33:09.289
Just 20 minutes.
That was all.

33:10.858 --> 33:13.727
I know.

33:13.794 --> 33:15.729
Will you tell that to Peter--

33:15.796 --> 33:18.799
that I sat her down
with a puzzle?

33:19.900 --> 33:22.503
He won't talk to me.

33:22.569 --> 33:26.073
Oh, this kid's a champ.
Oh, honey.

33:26.140 --> 33:28.575
We talked it over in there,
didn't we, Megan?
Yeah.

33:28.642 --> 33:32.279
Next time she gets hungry,
she's gonna eat a hippopotamus.
[ laughs ]

33:32.346 --> 33:35.382
Thanks, Phil.
I can't believe
I let this happen.

33:35.449 --> 33:38.419
Oh, listen, kids are always
eating everything.

33:38.485 --> 33:41.755
Safety pins, erasers.
When I was eight,
I used to eat Paste.

33:42.990 --> 33:45.626
- I know, but still--
- Don't worry about it.

33:45.692 --> 33:48.228
Listen, she's gonna be fine.

33:48.295 --> 33:50.431
Her stomach May be sore
for a little while,

33:50.497 --> 33:53.467
but she'll be able
to eat all her dinner,
including dessert.

33:55.702 --> 33:58.038
Come on, honey.
Let's go see your brother.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.944
Thanks.
Okay.

34:09.750 --> 34:12.319
Hey, where have you been
the last five hours?

34:12.386 --> 34:15.621
I took a long,
therapeutic walk.
Mmm.

34:15.688 --> 34:17.658
Mind if I turn on
some lights?

34:25.899 --> 34:29.268
Oh, boy.
[ sighs ]

34:29.335 --> 34:32.272
heard about
What happened today.

34:32.339 --> 34:34.274
Today is not important.

34:34.341 --> 34:38.344
September 12, 1968.
That's when it all started.
Mm-Hmm.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.748
My first day of high school.
By lunchtime,

34:40.813 --> 34:43.016
I realized they were gonna
force me to be educated,

34:43.083 --> 34:46.253
so I rolled a bowling ball down
the MAIN classroom corridor.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.889
I wasn't gonna make it
easy for them--
Wait a minute.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.391
What are you talking about?
You having a nervous breakdown?

34:51.458 --> 34:55.161
I wish I was.
A nervous breakdown would be
a breeze compared to this.

34:55.228 --> 34:58.065
To what?
Thinking about my life.

34:58.132 --> 35:01.535
I'm beginning to think
maybe I got off the bus
a few stops early.

35:01.602 --> 35:04.004
Do you know I was the only kid
in my boy scout troop,

35:04.071 --> 35:07.808
maybe the whole B.S.A.,
that never tried
to get a merit badge?

35:07.875 --> 35:10.711
I took an "F" In Chaucer
rather than apologize
to my professor...

35:10.778 --> 35:15.682
for saying he didn't
speak middle english
very well.

35:15.749 --> 35:18.919
I don't know.
Maybe I am having
a nervous breakdown.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.921
You're just having
a bad day. That's all.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.923
No, when westphall
was chewing me out,

35:22.990 --> 35:25.559
it was like the principal
was taking my bowling ball away.

35:25.626 --> 35:27.561
I don't like authority.

35:27.628 --> 35:30.697
Like it or not,
westphall is right.
Doctors don't carry guns.

35:30.764 --> 35:32.933
That's easy to say.
You're not going into
emergency Medicine.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.137
Don't give me that.
I've been in E.R.
Just as long as you have.

35:37.204 --> 35:39.506
I've been knocked around
down there.
I didn't go out and buy a gun.

35:39.573 --> 35:41.942
Phil, I'm gonna spend
my life down there.

35:42.009 --> 35:44.912
I've always only wanted
to work in the emergency room.

35:44.978 --> 35:47.314
It's got excitement.
You know, vitality, chaos.

35:47.381 --> 35:50.050
There's nothing like it
anywhere else in the hospital.

35:50.117 --> 35:52.586
A guy can be a bandit down there
and still do some Good.

35:52.653 --> 35:56.123
What am I gonna do now?

35:56.190 --> 35:59.626
I'm scared.
I'm scared to go back in there.

35:59.693 --> 36:01.628
Listen to me.

36:01.695 --> 36:05.866
We're all scared, Wayne.
Scared of one thing or another.

36:05.933 --> 36:09.536
You know, sometimes I go
into a restaurant
or any room anywhere...

36:09.603 --> 36:11.538
and every face I see is white.

36:11.605 --> 36:13.607
There's people
who hate me right off the bat...

36:13.674 --> 36:15.943
just for being black,
who would wanna kill me.

36:16.009 --> 36:18.412
I don't even know who for sure.

36:18.479 --> 36:20.914
But I gotta be prepared
for a wisecrack...

36:20.981 --> 36:23.784
or a fistfight.

36:23.851 --> 36:25.919
But you know what I do?

36:25.986 --> 36:28.155
I stand in that doorway,

36:28.222 --> 36:30.390
I suck it in,

36:30.457 --> 36:32.426
and I keep walking
right to my table.

36:59.253 --> 37:01.922
Wanna buy a gun?

37:14.902 --> 37:16.837

Hello. Mr. Lukovic.

37:49.803 --> 37:53.107
<i>No, I can't.
I'm in the middle
of my dinner.</i>

37:54.975 --> 37:58.979
Mr. Lukovic, I can't come over
every time one of your friends
has a problem.

37:59.046 --> 38:02.583
<i>Either bring him to the hospital
or find yourself a regular g.P.</i>

38:02.649 --> 38:04.651
Okay? I'm hanging up now.

38:04.718 --> 38:06.754
Bye.

38:06.820 --> 38:08.789
Good-Bye.

38:21.835 --> 38:23.837
Well?

38:23.904 --> 38:26.006
Well, your friend is very Old.

38:26.073 --> 38:28.041
His heart is failing.

38:28.108 --> 38:30.911
He should be in the hospital
so we can watch him.

38:30.978 --> 38:32.913
You know about medicine,
Dr. Morrison,

38:32.980 --> 38:37.050
but what you don't know
about people could
fill up fenway Park.

38:37.117 --> 38:40.888
He wants to die in the same bed
he's slept in for 40 years.

38:40.954 --> 38:43.390
Sit down.
Have a cup of coffee.

38:43.457 --> 38:46.693
It'll warm you up before
you go into all that rain.

38:49.163 --> 38:52.299
There's a fellow two blocks
around the corner
needs you to look in on him.

38:52.366 --> 38:55.235
I can't.
I'm on call tonight.

38:56.437 --> 38:58.772
It'll take you a minute
or two, tops.

38:58.839 --> 39:02.443
I can't be late.
I'm covering for another doctor.

39:03.677 --> 39:06.413
This man's in a wheelchair,
paralyzed.

39:06.480 --> 39:09.049
Mr. Lukovic,

39:09.116 --> 39:12.219
I think it's a terrific thing
that you're so concerned
about your neighbors.

39:12.286 --> 39:16.123
But I can't make any more
house calls for you.

39:16.190 --> 39:20.327
They're dangerous
for the patient
as well as for the doctor.

39:20.394 --> 39:23.730
In the time it takes for me
to get through traffic
and get over here,

39:23.797 --> 39:25.999
I could be seeing five or six
people in the hospital.

39:26.066 --> 39:29.737
Used to be,
people went to the hospital
because they had to.

39:29.803 --> 39:33.207
Now they get a sliver
in their big toe,
and they're lying in traction.

39:33.273 --> 39:37.678
Do you know
who that man is in there?
He drove the coal wagon.

39:37.745 --> 39:41.749
He'd come to your home,
open the chute, and the coal
would fall down into the cellar.

39:41.815 --> 39:45.519
It was filthy work,
but every home
was warm in the wintertime.

39:45.586 --> 39:48.722
Coal Wagons.
Before your time.

39:48.789 --> 39:50.724
Things used to be different.

39:50.791 --> 39:54.128
The fish man
would come around to each block
with that day's freshest catch.

39:54.194 --> 39:56.764
No frozen fish sticks.
And the vegetable man...

39:56.830 --> 39:58.766
with the big voice,
yelling, "Strawberries!"

39:58.832 --> 40:01.869
and the bread man,
they came to your home.

40:01.935 --> 40:06.106
They were people you knew,
people you could rely on.

40:06.173 --> 40:10.177
Forget about fancy tests
and little green Pills.

40:10.244 --> 40:12.880
Give your patients a little
attention, some compassion.

40:12.946 --> 40:15.883
That's what they need.
We do that
at the hospital.

40:15.949 --> 40:18.218
All over this city
there are shut-Ins, old people,

40:18.285 --> 40:20.220
sick people,
people who live alone.

40:20.287 --> 40:23.757
They don't have a lot
of money or INSURANCE
or unions to protect them.

40:23.824 --> 40:26.827
They don't have cars
to get around.
And some of them are afraid...

40:26.894 --> 40:28.829
to go outside,
of what's wrong with them.

40:28.896 --> 40:30.831
Afraid to even admit
that they're sick.

40:30.898 --> 40:33.734
That's a lot of people, Doctor.
Who's going to
take care of them?

40:33.801 --> 40:38.005
I don't know.
But I can't.

40:38.072 --> 40:43.343
In my time,
men became doctors because
it was a calling from God.

40:43.410 --> 40:46.613
But, no,
you doctors today,

40:46.680 --> 40:49.883
you're spoiled,
you're selfish.

40:49.950 --> 40:51.919
You might as well be a lawyer
or an accountant.

40:54.121 --> 40:56.523
Mr. Lukovic, I've got
to get to the hospital.

41:00.894 --> 41:04.598
Please, don't call me again.

41:14.608 --> 41:16.510
Ah!

41:18.245 --> 41:20.180
Who wants to try it?
Dr. Ehrlich?

41:20.247 --> 41:22.382
No, I can't.
Oh, no, it's easy.
Go ahead.

41:22.449 --> 41:24.952
No, really. My hand.
I can't.
Oh.

41:25.018 --> 41:26.987
Somebody--

41:44.371 --> 41:46.807
god!

41:46.874 --> 41:50.978
The vessels
through the PERICARDIUM
should look like this.

41:51.044 --> 41:55.082
Dr. Craig, I wanna be a surgeon.
I'm gonna be a surgeon.
The best surgeon.

41:55.149 --> 41:57.418
I appreciate all the time
you've taken with me,
and if you wanna stop,

41:57.484 --> 42:00.354
that's fine too, but I'm
gonna keep playing handball.

42:00.421 --> 42:02.356
I'm gonna be more careful.
I'll use more common sense,

42:02.423 --> 42:05.959
but tomorrow morning
at 6:30, I'm gonna be out there
on the court, same as always.

42:06.026 --> 42:08.595
Do you understand?
And I surf too.

42:08.662 --> 42:10.597
What do you want me to do,
Ehrlich, applaud?

42:10.664 --> 42:14.067
I just wanted you to know,
because after we had
our talk this morning,

42:14.134 --> 42:18.105
I started going a little flaky,
and that's definitely not
the direction I intend to go.

42:18.172 --> 42:21.308
And I'm sorry
to have bothered you,
but I'm glad I did.

42:21.375 --> 42:23.343
Good night.

42:25.145 --> 42:29.016
What can I tell you?
He's from california.

42:33.220 --> 42:35.222
Sorry I'm late, Peter.
No problem.

42:35.289 --> 42:37.658
It's been real slow
in here tonight.

42:37.724 --> 42:40.327
How's Megan?
She's fine.

42:40.394 --> 42:42.863
She's gonna be all right.

42:42.930 --> 42:44.932
Look, I know it's none
of my business--

42:44.998 --> 42:48.235
You're right. It isn't.

42:48.302 --> 42:51.739
It was an accident, Peter.
It could've happened to anyone.

42:51.805 --> 42:55.242
I've been calling home
in the middle of the afternoon
every day for a year now,

42:55.309 --> 42:58.245
and I've been wishing that
Myra wouldn't answer the phone.

42:58.312 --> 43:00.314
I've been wishing
she wasn't even there.

43:00.380 --> 43:03.517
I've been wishing this
whole thing was just a dream,
but it's not.

43:03.584 --> 43:05.953
I mean,
she does answer the phone.

43:06.019 --> 43:07.955
And the next thing I know,
we get to arguing.

43:08.021 --> 43:10.491
Usually about money.
Yesterday, she was upset...

43:10.557 --> 43:12.593
because there was a sale
on sneakers at Jordan Marsh,

43:12.659 --> 43:14.595
and I didn't have enough
for Megan to get a pair.

43:14.661 --> 43:16.997
Listen, man, I want Megan
to have sneakers too.

43:18.665 --> 43:21.535
I can remember
when Myra couldn't wait
for me to get home at night.

43:21.602 --> 43:25.672
And now she can't stand
for me to touch her.

43:25.739 --> 43:28.475
Uh, just the sound of my voice--

43:31.678 --> 43:34.181
We haven't made love since
She was pregnant with Timothy.

43:35.949 --> 43:37.885
Jack, there's a call
for you on 51.

43:37.951 --> 43:40.821
Mr. Lukovic.
[ sighs ]

43:40.888 --> 43:43.557
tell him I'm not here.
All righty.

43:45.726 --> 43:48.262
I guess I'd better be
getting on home.

43:48.328 --> 43:52.132
<i>[ Thunderclap ]</i>

44:00.240 --> 44:02.209
<i>[ door opens ]</i>

44:10.250 --> 44:12.519
Megan ate all her supper.

44:12.586 --> 44:14.588
She went right to sleep.

44:14.655 --> 44:16.623
All the excitement, I guess.

44:17.791 --> 44:20.194
You hungry?

44:20.260 --> 44:22.229
There's meat loaf
on the counter.

44:24.198 --> 44:26.967
Did you hear me?

44:27.034 --> 44:29.770
I said, there's meat loaf!
Did you hear me?

44:31.872 --> 44:34.541
Pick that up.
Pick it up yourself!

44:34.608 --> 44:37.578
<i>[ Objects clattering ]
you don't give me
anything but trouble.</i>

44:37.644 --> 44:39.613
You give me nothing
but trouble and pain.

44:39.680 --> 44:42.082
Our little girl--
don't even talk
to me about that!

44:42.149 --> 44:44.384
Because you're upstairs
in the middle of the
afternoon taking a nap!

44:44.451 --> 44:46.386
You're damn right!
I was exhausted!

44:46.453 --> 44:48.388
Exhausted from what?
From you.

44:48.455 --> 44:50.524
From being saddled with the life
of two children and dead Air.

44:50.591 --> 44:52.826
'cause that's what you are!
You are dead air!

44:52.893 --> 44:55.662
Shut up! Shut up!
Dead Air! That's--

44:59.433 --> 45:03.170
I'm sorry. Okay.
Listen to me. Listen.

45:07.341 --> 45:11.545
Uh, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna get outta here
for a little bit.

45:11.612 --> 45:13.680
No, you're not, Peter.

45:13.747 --> 45:16.884
This time, I'm leaving.

45:16.950 --> 45:19.887
For once,
you stay and you deal with it.

45:41.442 --> 45:43.377
Mr. Lukovic?

45:43.444 --> 45:45.412
He stopped breathing.

45:53.287 --> 45:55.322
[ chattering, indistinct ]

46:01.495 --> 46:06.733
- We give him
some intracardiac epi?
- Epi.

46:34.895 --> 46:37.231
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

46:37.297 --> 46:39.266
One more time.
Stand Clear.

46:44.505 --> 46:46.774
[ chattering ]

46:48.776 --> 46:54.014
<i>Mr. Lukovic, your friend's
gonna be all right.</i>

46:54.081 --> 46:57.251
You bastard!
I said he'll be okay.

46:57.317 --> 46:59.753
He could've died
because you didn't come!

46:59.820 --> 47:02.156
He went through all this pain
just now because of you.

47:02.222 --> 47:04.191
Because you didn't come
when I called.

47:04.258 --> 47:06.760
You selfish, lazy--
That's enough, all right?

47:06.827 --> 47:08.796
I've heard enough.

47:09.830 --> 47:11.799
When am I gonna learn?

47:11.865 --> 47:15.436
Every time I stick my neck out,
I end up regretting it.

47:19.573 --> 47:23.577
Don't you see,
if you hadn't brought him in
here, he'd be dead now?

47:25.979 --> 47:27.948
So don't give me that...

47:28.015 --> 47:31.185
about how rotten I am
and how this world stinks!

47:31.251 --> 47:35.722
It was different in your time.
I know it's changing.

47:35.789 --> 47:38.559
It's changing too fast.

47:38.625 --> 47:41.562
And I know it's terrifying
for you.
It terrifies me too.

47:41.628 --> 47:44.331
I'm gonna be a father.
I have to bring my children
into this world.

47:44.398 --> 47:47.835
I don't wanna be left behind
any more than you do.

47:49.470 --> 47:53.607
But it's not my fault,
so don't lay it on my shoulders.

47:56.477 --> 47:58.412
Okay.

47:58.479 --> 48:01.281
I won't call you again.

48:44.825 --> 48:45.993
