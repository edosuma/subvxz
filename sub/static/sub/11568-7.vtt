VETERINARIAN:
<i>Okay, here's the deal.</i>

02:37.858 --> 02:40.058
We've cleaned the bird up,
we've noticed
a lot of lacerations,

02:40.060 --> 02:42.761
one would require stitches
to close, but the, um...

02:42.763 --> 02:44.763
The larger issue
is the broken wing.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.266
The radius was shattered
and the ulna
has two fractures in it.

02:47.268 --> 02:50.836
Now, I can set the bone
and put what is essentially
a cast on the wing,

02:50.838 --> 02:53.238
and there's a decent chance
at a full recovery.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.274
But that is going to run you
about $650.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.277
-So, most people just elect
to euthanize the animal.

say that's worth it,

this is just a pigeon, so...

03:05.019 --> 03:06.652

03:52.666 --> 03:54.833
Yeah, it got my attention too.

03:54.835 --> 03:58.470
"Bring cash," it said.
Obviously, a whore.

03:58.472 --> 04:04.276
But I love large labias
so, what was I supposed to do?

04:04.278 --> 04:07.613
So, I got a room
at a shitty motel,
got real drunk.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.748
I hear a knock at the door,
I open it.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.484

see my cell phone

09:23.396 --> 09:25.030
(EXCLAIMS)

09:25.032 --> 09:26.598
(SIGHS)

09:26.600 --> 09:29.935
Okay, (BLEEP) it.
Worse comes to worse,
I commit suicide.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.439
(SCREAMING)

09:34.441 --> 09:35.941
Oh!

09:37.109 --> 09:39.678
Oh, my God! I'm flying!

09:40.112 --> 09:43.014
I'm free!

09:43.016 --> 09:45.317
(INDISTINCT TALKING
OVER RADIO)

09:47.687 --> 09:49.654
(SIREN BLARING)

09:51.390 --> 09:52.757
You saved our lives, Pigeon.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.694
Now let's get the (BLEEP)
out of here.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.562
Aren't you coming?

09:57.564 --> 10:01.199
(LAUGHS) You know,
the old me would make a joke
about ejaculating.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.903
But the new me,
the one who's mind and body
are in harmony,

10:04.905 --> 10:06.838
will just answer the question.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.040
No, I am not coming...

10:09.042 --> 10:10.742
In the van.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.945
(CHUCKLES) Oh, God,
that already sounds
like an ejaculation joke.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.682
No, no, no.
I'm not getting in the van
with you

10:17.684 --> 10:21.086
because I'm flying!

10:21.088 --> 10:23.655
I'll see you
back at the house.

10:23.657 --> 10:27.258
Hey, I love you guys!

10:29.228 --> 10:32.664
I wonder if Pigeon sees
that red-tail hawk
flying towards him?

10:32.666 --> 10:34.699
(HAWK SCREECHES)

10:34.701 --> 10:36.301
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

10:38.137 --> 10:40.071
$825?

10:40.073 --> 10:43.642
Then I think maybe this time
we just put him down.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.877
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

10:53.586 --> 10:55.053
This is an awesome bird.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.821
You're holding me
too tight, man.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.923
-Female, huh?
-What?
