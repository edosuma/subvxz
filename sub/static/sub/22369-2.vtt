[MIRANDA] Wait, what the heck is that?

01:12.781 --> 01:15.617
Why is there a taco covering
my knees? That's the best part!

01:15.700 --> 01:17.619
Patrick, do something!
Break the computer!

01:17.702 --> 01:19.579
No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

01:19.662 --> 01:21.831
Listen, I know why we
didn't get to New York.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.874
Because you weigh too much.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.960
- No. The suitcase adds 20 pounds.
- Okay.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.588
No, it's because we didn't have a plan.

01:28.671 --> 01:33.760

us into my new Five Phase Plan

Voilà.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.560
[MIRANDA] Ooh, very nice.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.854
First, we get paid
for this advertisement.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.525
Then we take that money
and we make merchandise,

01:48.608 --> 01:51.319
which we then sell for more money.

01:51.402 --> 01:56.991
Then we take that money and
we build a Miranda theme park.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.994
- Then we buy a bank.
- Well, yeah.

02:00.078 --> 02:04.624
Then we get the money from inside the
bank and fly first class to Broadway.

So, how long till we get money?

02:33.736 --> 02:37.365
All we have to do is go
to our local Taco Ta-go

to you about some things, too.

For instance, I never got
my alimony check last month.

call it alimony if we're still married.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.861
Why are you so interested
in Emily all of a sudden?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.572
Because she's cool now. When
I left, she was annoying.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.240
She was a baby.

10:16.324 --> 10:20.578
I know. But she grew
out of that. Who knew?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.705
There's something special about her now.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.417
In fact, she reminds me a lot of me.

Oh. Listen, I don't know
what your angle is here,

10:32.173 --> 10:33.841
but I want to make something very clear.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.552
Emily is my daughter, she's my family.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.597
And I'm not gonna leave here
without her. Do you understand that?

10:39.680 --> 10:42.767
- [LAUGHS] Yeah.
- What?

10:42.850 --> 10:46.687
I've never seen you act like
that before. So assertive.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.606
Oh, no.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.566
Come on, Bethany. What happened to us?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.568
We used to have something
really good together.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.737
You left me. Twice.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.906
Bethany, you know I used
to be in a bad place.

10:56.989 --> 11:00.493
I had a wife that was a total nag,
a daughter who would never shut up

11:00.576 --> 11:02.411
and an annoying baby.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.747
But now I've changed.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.965

Yeah. But the point is, with
all those things considered,

11:18.886 --> 11:20.596
I am ready to be a dad.

11:21.639 --> 11:26.143
And besides, you have the other
daughter. So why are you being so selfish?

recognition that she deserves.

and they kicked her to the curb.

push you around anymore.

I was gonna have with Miranda at home.

12:34.295 --> 12:38.007
Yeah, 'cause I stand up to her.
All the time, I stand up to her.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.927
She'd say something like, "I'm gonna
do something annoying to Emily."

12:42.011 --> 12:44.096
And then I'd say, "No way, Jose."

12:44.180 --> 12:46.765
Her name is Miranda, not Jose.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.560
No. No. Jos... It's an expression.

having fun with Dad.

art of hot water to soften noodles.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.989
Oh. Well, that's perfect.

13:02.072 --> 13:07.369

- I knew that.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.770

abused diet pills through my 20s?

- See? I'm full of surprises.

my daughter and a great artist.

Oh, I don't know about that.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.427
Oh, no, it's true. We
had a paternity test done.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.472
Now, Emily, I've seen a
lot of great art in my day.

I know you've got what it takes.

there. You get into a real art gallery.

art with some of my connections?

14:30.995 --> 14:32.621

There is this famous Realtor and
he's on all of the bus benches.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.419
He comes in sometimes.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.379
Maybe he would buy one.
