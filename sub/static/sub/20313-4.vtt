09:37.494 --> 09:39.579
This is in preparation
for our big match

09:39.579 --> 09:41.789
coming up next week.

09:41.789 --> 09:45.168
Ha! That should shut
Ms. Galka's fat catty mouth.

09:45.168 --> 09:48.088
She is such a know it all.
I just can't stand it.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.215
Ah, you want me to go ahead

09:50.215 --> 09:52.300
and turn that mic off of ya?

09:52.300 --> 09:56.596
-Here we go.
-Oh my god.

09:56.596 --> 10:00.350

Okay, a few more minutes.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.082
[Leung] Hello. Coach.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.251
-What are you doing?
-Oh, I just wanted to check

10:26.251 --> 10:27.961
the air pressure I put
in these volleyballs

10:27.961 --> 10:29.629
was up to your standards.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.757
And why would I car...

10:35.718 --> 10:37.512
Yeah, that's great.
They look great.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.098
So that's perfect.
Thank you Mr. Leung.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.600
And the water bottles?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.767
What about them?

10:42.767 --> 10:47.063
Would you like water
in them again?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.649
Yes, that would be great,
if you did that.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.278
Thank you so much for coming by.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.988
I know what you're doing.

10:57.532 --> 11:01.286
It's not gonna
bother me anymore.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.121
So thank you. If there's
nothing else you need,

11:03.121 --> 11:04.914
we'll see you soon.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.374
Nicely played.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.502
Now it's my turn.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.384
Weirdo.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.969
Well, he's a weirdo. Sorry.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.225
-[Lisa] Hey Simon.
-Hi.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.228
-Hi there.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.317
-How ya doing?
-Fine.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.068
-Good!
-Yeah good.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.530
Super. So, uh, are we fine?

11:36.530 --> 11:38.072
Oh sure, we're fine.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.534
-[Lisa] Oh great. Oh good.
-[Bobbi] We're great.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.826
Yeah. Oh, except for the comment

11:41.826 --> 11:44.204
about the catty mouth thing.

11:44.204 --> 11:48.625
Right, ah, about that, I um...

11:48.625 --> 11:51.085
I was totally joking.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.712
-That's a joke?
-Yeah, see? Watch this...

11:53.712 --> 11:55.382
Hey Simon.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.676
Ya big fat head.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.887
-What?
-Ya big fat head.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.309
Simon.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.810
Okay, I didn't know before,

12:07.810 --> 12:09.979
but now I do, that's a joke.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.731
-Yeah.
-Yeah, super fun.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.317
Yeah.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.445
Oh, I'm not good at this.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.199
What are you doing,
starting with out me?

12:21.199 --> 12:23.159
Well, I just thought I would
call the girls in early so,

12:23.159 --> 12:24.827
they're warmed up for
when you arrive.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.081
Oh, well.
Very kind of you, Mr. Leung.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.249
But please don't do that again.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.291
And please don't teach them

12:30.291 --> 12:32.919
the incorrect technique.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.255
Now, Kira, I'm going to show
you how to serve today.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.631
It's okay sir.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.634
Coach Leung already
went over it with me.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.470
-Assistant Coach.
-Coach Leung helped me as well.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.763
Okay, again,
Assistant Coach Leung.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.267
Coach Leung said I need to keep

12:47.267 --> 12:48.851
my weight on my back foot more.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.145
-That's true.
-[Gerry] Is that what he said?

12:51.145 --> 12:53.398
-He's a great coach.
-Oh.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.774
Yeah, great assistant coach.

12:55.774 --> 12:58.152
Well, come on in everybody.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.862
What should we work
on now Coach?

12:59.862 --> 13:02.616
-[Leung] Well...
-I will tell you, Kira.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.910
First, understand that
I am the head coach.

13:05.910 --> 13:09.080
So, we call me
Coach Duncan,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.832
or Coach D.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.793
Girls, Mr. Duncan is right,
he is the coach.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.589
I am the assistant.
Now, let's bring it in

13:17.589 --> 13:19.549
and we'll do our little cheer
we came up with this morning.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.509
What do you mean, cheer?
We don't have a cheer. We
don't...

13:21.509 --> 13:24.845
[Girls and Leung]
Goooo Coach Leung!

13:27.932 --> 13:30.769
Cute, cute.

13:30.769 --> 13:34.897
Well then, I guess
if you're coach, then...

13:34.897 --> 13:36.857
You should demonstrate
how we pass the ball.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.276
Come on, I'll serve it to you

13:38.276 --> 13:39.653
-and you can pass it. Come on.
-No, we don't...

13:39.653 --> 13:40.903
[Gerry] Yeah, we want to see
that.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.363
This is what a coach does.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.365
-So get yourself...
-[Leung] Yeah, but maybe...

13:44.365 --> 13:46.200
In your ready position.
Coach Leung?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.619
-[Leung mumbles] ...This...?
-Yeah, come on.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.663
Here we go.
I will hit the ball to you

13:49.663 --> 13:51.205
and you will pass it.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.166
Show them how it's done.
Here we go...Ready?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.793
-[Leung mumbles] Yeah.
-All right.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.128
Oh, that was a good one.
Arms out.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.714
Oh, that's not going to help.
Legs bent.

13:59.714 --> 14:03.092
Remember. Wow, you gotta
get an arm on it.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.386
Maybe just try
to touch the ball.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.348
Oh no! Bend the legs,

14:08.348 --> 14:09.974
just like you told them, right?

14:09.974 --> 14:13.353
Oh no! What happened there?

14:13.353 --> 14:16.356
Come on, Coach. Come on. Huh?

14:16.356 --> 14:19.192
Be ready please.
Here we go, come on.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.235
Oh, we're not done yet.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.738
Wasn't so easy, was it? Come on.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.282
Oh wow, come on.
-[Leung grunts]

14:26.282 --> 14:29.869
-You want to be the coach.
-Mr. Duncan!

14:29.869 --> 14:31.746
Can I speak to you for a second?

14:31.746 --> 14:33.581
[Leung groans]

14:33.581 --> 14:35.291
-[Gerry whispers] Get up!

14:50.390 --> 14:52.266
[Callaghan] This is you
working together Duncan?

14:52.266 --> 14:53.601
This is you
being the good coach

14:53.601 --> 14:55.102
and working through
your differences?

14:55.102 --> 14:58.565
-I was using him as an example.
-Of what?

14:58.565 --> 14:59.858
How to get pummelled?

14:59.858 --> 15:02.485
It's true sir.
It was an exercise.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.986
-It was?

15:03.986 --> 15:06.865
Yes, Mr. Duncan, Coach,

15:06.865 --> 15:09.868
was teaching the kids about
unsportsmanlike conduct.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.203
-You agreed to this?
-Yes, sir.

15:12.203 --> 15:15.498
Mr. Duncan's technique's
are unorthodox, but...

15:15.498 --> 15:17.667
I'm learning so much from him.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.835
Really?

15:18.835 --> 15:20.294
Yup.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.380
Alright.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.841
-Don't get hurt.
-Thank you sir.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.801

apologize for interrupting?

handle the arrangements?

16:39.791 --> 16:42.543
If you could... perform it.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.212
Do you think you could bury
Feather facing the east?

16:45.212 --> 16:49.049
So that he or she can see
the sunrise every single day.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.553

I'll take care of it all.

head on home? Okay?

Why'd you bail me out back
there?

17:33.344 --> 17:35.763
Well, I realized, that

17:35.763 --> 17:38.933
if he found out the truth
he might split us up.

17:38.933 --> 17:42.896
And... I wouldn't get
to coach with you anymore.

-Yeah,

an announcement now.

I have to.

Xavier Academy.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.295
This is Ms. Mason speaking.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.965
As some of you might have heard.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.969
Earlier I said some things
about Ms. Galka that...

18:55.969 --> 18:58.972
Were a little mean and hurtful.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.390
I just wanted to say,
I was hurt

19:01.390 --> 19:03.893
and I truly didn't
mean any of it.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.270
I mean sure, Ms. Galka

19:06.270 --> 19:09.356
can be hard on me at times.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.692
Most of the time, actually,

19:11.692 --> 19:13.861
she's pretty hard on me.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.488
And you know,

19:15.488 --> 19:18.324
I've been nothing but supportive

19:18.324 --> 19:21.035
and kind to her,
so that's really weird

19:21.035 --> 19:22.870
that she'd be like that to me.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.873
'Cause I am a good friend.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.166
You know, last year...

19:27.166 --> 19:29.585
I went out of my way to find her

19:29.585 --> 19:32.088
a very special birthday gift.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.381
And what did she get me?
Absolutely nothing.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.467
She didn't even say hi
to me on my birthday.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.512
Let alone get me a gift.
So I don't take any of it back.

19:39.512 --> 19:45.434
I stand by what I said.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.520
So there.

to replace the bag.

on the contents
