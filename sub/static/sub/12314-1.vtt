Is it recording?

00:33.848 --> 00:34.775
Yeah.

00:34.872 --> 00:36.497
All right.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.251
All right.
Can we clear this area, please?

00:41.175 --> 00:42.157
See that?

00:42.263 --> 00:44.401
I talk, people listen.

00:44.503 --> 00:45.364
Hi, babe.

00:45.463 --> 00:47.318
- Hi, babe.
- How are you?

00:47.415 --> 00:48.528
I'm good.
How are you?

00:48.630 --> 00:50.386
I'm good.
You having fun?

00:50.487 --> 00:51.894
Yeah. Are you having fun?

00:51.991 --> 00:53.846
- You look mighty tan.
- Hey!

00:53.942 --> 00:56.626
Oh, my God!

00:56.726 --> 00:57.675
Do it again.

00:57.782 --> 00:58.643
Do it again. Ready?

00:58.742 --> 01:00.466
Hold on.

01:03.158 --> 01:04.271
Hey, dude.

01:04.373 --> 01:05.935
- Zachy poo.
- What's up, baby?

01:06.038 --> 01:08.405
Hi, Zachy poo.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.738
I see.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.212
You want to get in on this, Lauren?

01:12.310 --> 01:14.165
Come here. Come on.

01:14.262 --> 01:15.210
Who loves you, baby?

01:15.318 --> 01:16.179
You do.

01:16.278 --> 01:17.423
Of course.

01:17.526 --> 01:18.639
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.

01:18.741 --> 01:21.261
Shut up.

01:21.366 --> 01:22.740
Are you a little jealous, Zach?

01:22.837 --> 01:24.015
A little jealous?

01:24.117 --> 01:25.939
I thought your girl was throwing me
some rhythm there.

01:26.037 --> 01:27.346
What do you mean "my girl"?

01:27.445 --> 01:28.557
Yeah, what do you mean "his girl"?

01:28.661 --> 01:30.003
Come on, you two.

01:30.101 --> 01:31.181
I ain't nobody's girl.

01:31.285 --> 01:32.300
Enough with the charade.

01:32.405 --> 01:34.445
All right.
Why are you still here?

01:34.549 --> 01:36.175
Because nobody's following me.

01:36.276 --> 01:37.170
Where are we, by the way?

01:37.269 --> 01:38.130
Does anybody know?

01:38.229 --> 01:39.855
El Matador, homey.

01:39.957 --> 01:41.135
El Matador.

01:41.236 --> 01:42.611
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:42.709 --> 01:44.170
You guys are my best friends.

01:44.276 --> 01:45.487
No shit.

01:45.588 --> 01:46.668
Okay.

01:46.773 --> 01:47.634
Hi, guys.

01:49.588 --> 01:51.115
I'm totally gonna puke.

01:51.221 --> 01:53.009
Guys, do you think...
Guys, do you think

01:53.108 --> 01:54.995
we're gonna know
each other forever?

01:55.092 --> 01:56.368
- Nah!
- Shut up.

01:56.468 --> 01:57.777
I fucking hope not.

01:57.876 --> 02:00.265
Let's create some memories.

02:00.372 --> 02:01.899
Come on.

02:02.004 --> 02:04.207
Nice, Zach.

02:04.308 --> 02:07.472
I can't drink, man.
I gotta do this to get high.

02:07.572 --> 02:09.610
Oh, be careful.
Come on.

02:09.716 --> 02:11.090
Hey!

02:14.195 --> 02:16.203
Holy shit.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.450
Pretty fucking funny, Zach.

02:21.555 --> 02:24.489
- Give me the camera.
- My fucking arm.

02:30.386 --> 02:32.753
Hey, man.
You all right?

02:34.163 --> 02:36.301
Do I look all right?

03:01.554 --> 03:03.244
He's over me.

03:03.345 --> 03:04.360
Oh, that I don't believe.

03:04.465 --> 03:05.326
Whatever.

03:05.425 --> 03:06.919
No way any man could ever
get over you.

03:07.025 --> 03:08.934
- Because I'm great in bed, right?
- Funny. Boy.

03:09.041 --> 03:11.407
Wow. When's the last time
you saw these guys?

03:11.505 --> 03:13.032
5 years.

03:13.136 --> 03:15.340
If you don't behave...
Oh, boy.

Nice touch.

04:45.805 --> 04:47.234
Damn.

04:47.341 --> 04:48.551
Boy toys.

04:48.653 --> 04:50.857
Hey, Lauren.

04:50.956 --> 04:51.818
Amy!

04:51.916 --> 04:54.087
- Hey!
- Wow!

04:55.404 --> 04:58.699
What you got there?
Hi.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.121
Wow. You have a family.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.042
- Wow.
- Can you take her for a sec?

05:04.140 --> 05:05.220
Okay.

05:05.324 --> 05:08.520
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.864
You and Zach came together.

05:09.964 --> 05:11.393
He just picked me up
at the bus station.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.834
<i>My butt's still dizzy. Whoa!</i>

05:13.931 --> 05:16.233
There you go.
Back to mom.

05:16.332 --> 05:18.154
Wow, she's heavy.
Cute kid.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.746
Thank you.

05:19.851 --> 05:22.273
And where's the birthday boy?

05:22.379 --> 05:24.070
Hey, mom.

05:24.171 --> 05:25.415
Wow.

05:25.515 --> 05:26.824
Hi. Who's this?

05:26.923 --> 05:28.035
This is Sarah.

05:28.139 --> 05:29.993
Hi.

05:30.091 --> 05:31.618
I'm uncle Zach.

05:31.722 --> 05:32.835
Yes. Oh!

05:32.939 --> 05:34.499
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

05:34.602 --> 05:35.911
So good to see you.

05:36.010 --> 05:37.025
I'll second that.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.592
James. Heard a lot about you.

05:38.698 --> 05:40.422
Likewise.

05:40.522 --> 05:42.246
Okay, let's go see this thing, huh?

05:42.346 --> 05:43.459
Yeah.

05:43.562 --> 05:44.839
<i>Which one's the Godspeed?</i>

05:44.938 --> 05:46.629
I don't think it will be hard to spot.

05:46.730 --> 05:48.868
Go on.

05:48.970 --> 05:49.897
It's okay.

05:49.994 --> 05:51.271
I promise.

06:16.105 --> 06:19.421
Marco.

06:19.529 --> 06:22.528
Polo.

06:22.633 --> 06:23.811
Marco!

06:23.912 --> 06:26.301
You're always cheating.

06:26.409 --> 06:27.837
I'm only cheating if you lose.

06:36.904 --> 06:38.180
Yo, dickhead.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.716
Come on, Amy.
You can do it.

06:56.615 --> 06:57.892
I'm right here, honey.

07:03.687 --> 07:05.148
There you go.

07:05.255 --> 07:08.069
Easy as pie. See?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.693
Danny always said he'd be
a millionaire by 30.

07:09.798 --> 07:10.846
Even back in high school.

07:10.950 --> 07:12.511
You said the same thing.

07:12.614 --> 07:13.475
Yeah, but I was kidding.

07:13.574 --> 07:14.784
Let's give ourselves the tour.

07:14.886 --> 07:16.511
Where the hell is he?

07:16.614 --> 07:17.956
I don't know about you guys,

07:18.054 --> 07:20.062
but I gotta pee.

07:21.638 --> 07:22.751
Watch your step, babe.

07:22.854 --> 07:24.829
Hey, Lauren, I think I found...

07:24.934 --> 07:26.178
I guess not.

07:28.998 --> 07:30.754
Classic Dan.

07:30.853 --> 07:32.097
He's having breakfast.

07:32.198 --> 07:33.791
Well, it's about time.

07:33.893 --> 07:35.748
Who's next?

07:37.221 --> 07:38.399
This little vixen is Michelle.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.483
Say hi.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.313
It's nice to meet you guys!

07:42.918 --> 07:44.608
See you in, like, two minutes.

07:44.709 --> 07:45.691
That's all it takes.

07:46.789 --> 07:47.650
Happy birthday.

07:47.749 --> 07:48.676
- Thank you.
- Great.

07:48.773 --> 07:50.115
Our daughter is scarred for life.

07:50.213 --> 07:51.642
She'll either grow up
to be oddly attracted

07:51.749 --> 07:52.764
to Popeye or a lesbian.

07:52.869 --> 07:54.298
Yo. Where's my gift?

07:54.404 --> 07:55.931
My presence is your present.

07:56.037 --> 07:57.182
Awesome.

07:57.284 --> 08:00.154
Do you have the receipt?

08:01.701 --> 08:04.734
<i>Jeez.</i>

08:04.836 --> 08:06.397
I wonder what this is.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.355
# For he's a jolly big asshole #

08:08.452 --> 08:09.913
# For he's a jolly big asshole #

08:10.020 --> 08:12.802
# For he's a jolly big asshole #

08:12.900 --> 08:14.972
He's 30 fucking years old.

08:17.283 --> 08:18.144
Who modeled for these?

08:18.243 --> 08:19.421
"Breast wishes."
Very clever.

08:19.524 --> 08:20.385
Can't wait to taste them.

08:20.483 --> 08:22.588
I wanted to get you real ones.

08:22.691 --> 08:24.251
Okay.

08:58.466 --> 09:00.189
# Yo ho ho #

09:00.290 --> 09:02.199
# It's a pervert's life for me #

09:02.305 --> 09:05.305
This is a nice fucking boat,
Mr. Rockefeller.

09:05.410 --> 09:06.490
Business must be good.

09:06.594 --> 09:07.739
- You like, huh?
- Yeah.

09:07.842 --> 09:10.711
Me, too.
I like very much.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.476
And I want to keep it that way.

09:12.577 --> 09:14.912
No smoking on board, birthday boy.

09:15.009 --> 09:15.903
Are you fucking kidding me?

09:16.001 --> 09:17.823
Baby's brand-new.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.360
How long you been running drugs?

09:22.465 --> 09:24.668
I prefer to make my fortune
the old fashioned way.

09:24.769 --> 09:25.630
How's that?

09:25.729 --> 09:27.071
With other people's money.

09:27.169 --> 09:29.535
All right, so, this is just what...

09:29.633 --> 09:31.772
Your getaway vehicle?

09:31.872 --> 09:33.399
I like it fine where I am.

09:34.688 --> 09:35.735
Hey, Sarah.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.783
You want to take a nap?

09:39.168 --> 09:41.590
There we are, huh?

09:41.696 --> 09:45.471
Are you having fun
on this big ole bed?

09:45.568 --> 09:46.615
Who's my girl?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.662
You are.
Aren't you?

09:53.343 --> 09:56.660
Now let's see if mommy can relax.

09:56.767 --> 09:58.742
You've already done the hard part.

09:58.847 --> 10:00.636
- You think?
- Sure.

10:00.735 --> 10:04.827
You got on board.
You scaled the wall.

10:04.927 --> 10:07.349
<i>Your mommy's crazy, sweetheart.</i>

10:07.455 --> 10:09.048
I hope you'll come
visit me in the madhouse

10:09.151 --> 10:10.427
when you're older.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.822
No. Your mom's acting human.

10:18.846 --> 10:20.788
Party time, people!

10:20.895 --> 10:22.585
Nothing like starting the day

10:22.686 --> 10:24.475
with a screaming orgasm,
isn't that right, baby?

10:24.574 --> 10:25.719
I don't know, you tell me.

10:25.822 --> 10:26.683
Look at that ass, Lauren.

10:29.950 --> 10:33.463
It's time for you to stop being
the perfect, caring husband,

10:33.566 --> 10:35.027
because I'm fine.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.956
No more talk.

10:42.078 --> 10:43.507
Time to get our groove on.

10:47.869 --> 10:49.495
Are we getting old?

10:49.597 --> 10:50.546
Not yet.

10:50.653 --> 10:52.660
Good.

10:58.717 --> 11:01.302
It's been one major
adrenaline rush for us

11:01.405 --> 11:02.582
ever since we met.

11:02.685 --> 11:04.692
So, uh, how many hours
has it been exactly?

11:04.797 --> 11:07.644
For your information,
not that it's any of your business,

11:07.741 --> 11:11.036
we've known each other
for exactly... um, babe?

11:13.692 --> 11:18.678
Two weeks, one day,
and 41/2 hours.

11:20.668 --> 11:24.563
She can tell time.
I'm impressed.

11:24.668 --> 11:28.148
The natives are thirsty.
Must feed the natives.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.772
Quench your thirst with a nice shot.

11:30.876 --> 11:33.297
The cleavers have arrived.

11:33.404 --> 11:34.647
And just in time.

11:34.747 --> 11:37.169
Screaming orgasm, June?

11:37.275 --> 11:39.380
I think your mother
may have dropped you

11:39.483 --> 11:40.890
on your head one
too many times, Dan.

11:40.987 --> 11:42.678
She's breast-feeding, you fool.

11:42.779 --> 11:44.917
No shit.
It's just O.J.

11:45.019 --> 11:46.841
Oh, thank you.

11:46.939 --> 11:49.044
Why are you wearing one of those?

11:52.826 --> 11:55.215
To cover my monster boobs.

11:57.114 --> 11:58.641
Monster boobs.

12:00.634 --> 12:02.195
That wasn't very funny.

12:02.298 --> 12:03.226
Yeah, I know.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.046
All right, no, seriously.

12:05.146 --> 12:07.535
I'd first like to thank you all
for coming out here

12:07.642 --> 12:11.155
and accepting my most humble
of invitations after all these years.

12:11.258 --> 12:12.436
I appreciate it.

12:12.538 --> 12:14.839
And I would like
to propose a toast

12:14.938 --> 12:18.996
to our dear friend,
with a great ass, I might add...

12:19.097 --> 12:20.341
Zach.

12:20.442 --> 12:21.968
Happy birthday, old man.

12:22.073 --> 12:23.861
Thank you.

12:23.961 --> 12:25.903
Whoa. Whoa.

12:26.010 --> 12:29.043
I dub thee captain for a day.

12:30.809 --> 12:31.954
Hang on, hang on.

12:32.057 --> 12:34.424
I'm not done with my toast yet.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.368
Here's to staying single,
seeing double,

12:37.465 --> 12:38.326
and sleeping triple.

12:40.824 --> 12:41.839
No disrespect.

12:41.944 --> 12:43.286
None taken?

12:44.601 --> 12:45.877
- Salute!
- Cheers.

12:45.976 --> 12:46.870
Salut.

12:46.968 --> 12:48.594
Salut!

12:54.008 --> 12:56.244
Come on, everybody.
Let's dance.

12:57.976 --> 12:59.983
Baby.

13:00.088 --> 13:03.830
Water's over there.

13:03.927 --> 13:05.105
Let's do it.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.477
Okay.

13:07.575 --> 13:09.517
Very impressive boat, Dan.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.340
Yacht, Jimmy.
It's a yacht.

13:22.550 --> 13:25.201
So, you still cruising the world...

13:25.303 --> 13:28.117
Aspen in the winter,
Maui in the summer?

13:28.214 --> 13:31.563
Last winter, Japan.
Yeah. Instructing.

13:31.670 --> 13:32.532
That was fun.

13:32.630 --> 13:34.321
You can snowboard in Japan?

13:36.150 --> 13:38.517
Yeah. Up north. Hokkaido.

13:38.614 --> 13:40.076
Lots of Australians.

13:40.182 --> 13:41.076
Cool.

13:41.174 --> 13:42.734
Man, this is wild.

13:42.838 --> 13:45.969
Ah, careful.
Easy, easy.

13:46.070 --> 13:46.964
You all right?

13:47.061 --> 13:48.622
Relax.

13:52.342 --> 13:54.284
Where are all
the fucking dolphins?

13:54.389 --> 13:56.178
What are you talking about?

13:56.277 --> 13:57.870
Remember Flipper?

13:57.973 --> 13:59.249
Fall in, they'll save you.

14:02.197 --> 14:03.888
Unless you save me first.

14:10.485 --> 14:12.340
Let me guess.
You're the king of the world, right?

14:12.436 --> 14:13.298
Very original.

14:13.396 --> 14:15.501
Zach, shut up.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.609
There it is.

14:39.155 --> 14:41.806
Thanks.

14:41.908 --> 14:43.500
See, that life raft seats 8,

14:43.603 --> 14:46.123
and there are only
6 of us, Amy, so we're set.

14:46.227 --> 14:48.015
Don't forget Sarah.

14:48.115 --> 14:50.482
I'm sorry.
So, 61/2.

14:53.459 --> 14:57.353
Actually, I think the orange
Kind of suits you.

15:13.586 --> 15:15.179
I'm hot.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.387
Yes. You are.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.374
I want to go swimming.

15:26.738 --> 15:29.356
You boys want to take a dip?

15:32.113 --> 15:34.830
I got masks and a knife.
Who wants?

15:34.929 --> 15:36.238
- Ooh, yeah.
- We do.

15:36.337 --> 15:38.093
We do.

15:38.193 --> 15:39.720
Oh, cute.

15:39.824 --> 15:41.679
Any special requests
for dinner, my captain?

15:41.777 --> 15:44.013
Yeah. Two mermaids on a stick.

15:44.113 --> 15:46.862
And now for the piece de resistance.

15:48.432 --> 15:50.188
I love her!

15:50.288 --> 15:51.368
I'm gonna name her Delphine.

15:51.472 --> 15:52.487
Told you we'd see a dolphin.

15:52.593 --> 15:53.454
Oh, wow.

15:53.552 --> 15:54.796
You coming, Dan?

15:54.896 --> 15:56.390
I'll be right with you.

15:57.872 --> 15:59.595
You want one, right?

16:01.104 --> 16:01.997
Duty calls.

16:02.096 --> 16:04.682
Go enjoy yourself, please.

16:04.783 --> 16:05.765
You're sure?

16:05.872 --> 16:07.399
- Fair.
- Mommy.

16:09.456 --> 16:10.349
Gee, thanks.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.375
All right.
Let's get wet.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.195
Should I take my cigarettes with me?

16:13.295 --> 16:15.270
Wow. It looks deep.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.441
Just kidding.

16:18.543 --> 16:21.031
That's funny.

16:21.135 --> 16:22.957
I'm coming, sweet girl.

16:25.103 --> 16:26.477
See you ladies in the water.

16:26.575 --> 16:29.095
Last one in is the last one in.

16:46.062 --> 16:47.971
I love it!

16:50.254 --> 16:52.393
Let's go.

16:52.494 --> 16:54.152
You and Amy seem really happy.

16:54.253 --> 16:56.392
We are.

16:56.494 --> 16:59.276
That's nice.

16:59.373 --> 17:01.828
You know what they say...

17:01.933 --> 17:03.362
You gotta kiss a lot of frogs

17:03.469 --> 17:04.396
to find your prince.

17:06.574 --> 17:08.548
I think Amy's still kissing.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.108
Ribbit.

17:11.213 --> 17:12.457
Ribbit.

17:15.532 --> 17:18.281
Well, you seem like a very nice frog.

17:18.381 --> 17:20.617
So do you.

17:21.933 --> 17:23.078
I don't mean a frog.

17:23.181 --> 17:25.896
I mean, just pretty good.

17:25.996 --> 17:28.713
I mean, just...

17:28.812 --> 17:30.786
Good. I mean, you're pretty,

17:30.892 --> 17:33.259
- You're good.
- Thank you.

17:33.356 --> 17:34.632
Yeah.

17:34.732 --> 17:36.706
She's beautiful.

17:36.812 --> 17:38.153
Thank you.

17:38.252 --> 17:39.746
I want kids, Amy.

17:39.852 --> 17:40.866
You know...

17:40.972 --> 17:43.044
one day, when the time's right.

17:43.148 --> 17:45.995
With Barbie?

17:46.091 --> 17:48.546
What's wrong with having a little fun?

17:48.652 --> 17:49.862
Nothing.

17:49.964 --> 17:53.029
If I was single and a guy...

17:53.131 --> 17:55.913
You don't need to be
a guy to have fun.

17:57.611 --> 17:58.788
In your dreams.

17:58.891 --> 18:01.509
And to think, if I hadn't been
such an ass in high school,

18:01.611 --> 18:02.920
It could have been
me instead of James.

18:03.018 --> 18:06.695
Yeah. Like I was
the only girl in your life, right?

18:09.931 --> 18:11.338
Why don't we head upstairs?

18:12.970 --> 18:14.464
Why not?

18:40.009 --> 18:41.089
Take that off.

18:41.193 --> 18:42.055
Why?

18:42.153 --> 18:43.746
Just, just come on.
Take it off.

18:43.849 --> 18:45.093
All right.

18:47.849 --> 18:49.507
Okay. Now close your eyes.

18:49.609 --> 18:51.975
- No.
- Come on. Close your eyes.

18:57.128 --> 18:59.648
Okay. Open 'em.

19:03.848 --> 19:04.928
Yeah.

19:08.168 --> 19:09.183
It's cool.

19:11.368 --> 19:13.278
Yeah. Let's go.

19:13.384 --> 19:15.359
Okay.

19:19.336 --> 19:20.546
So that's how it is, huh?

19:22.087 --> 19:26.146
Oh, my gosh.
That's no fair.

19:26.247 --> 19:28.516
It's so stupid and so long ago.

19:28.615 --> 19:29.825
I lost my top.

19:29.927 --> 19:31.552
Oh, my God, I feel so exposed.

19:31.655 --> 19:33.510
Most people are afraid of spiders

19:33.607 --> 19:36.062
or afraid to fly or scared of...

19:36.167 --> 19:37.574
Scared of clowns?

19:38.983 --> 19:40.063
Stop!

19:40.167 --> 19:41.509
Hey!

19:44.807 --> 19:48.701
Um, it's gotten worse
since I had Sarah.

19:48.807 --> 19:51.262
I don't want her to end up worrying
about stuff like that

19:51.366 --> 19:52.959
because of my paranoia.

19:53.062 --> 19:55.745
You know, my buddy Brad,

19:55.846 --> 19:57.504
He was afraid of circus clowns.

19:57.606 --> 19:59.547
- Was?
- Yep.

19:59.654 --> 20:01.345
What'd he do?

20:01.445 --> 20:03.103
Well, we...

20:03.206 --> 20:04.700
We took him to the circus.

20:04.806 --> 20:06.300
No! You let me down, Dan!

20:06.405 --> 20:07.354
The water looks great.

20:07.461 --> 20:09.119
Let me down!
Let me down... No!

20:09.221 --> 20:10.563
- No, no, no!
- Amy, trust me.

20:44.484 --> 20:46.372
Daddy, what's wrong?

21:00.771 --> 21:04.000
- Marco.
- Polo.

21:04.099 --> 21:05.026
Marco.

21:05.123 --> 21:06.617
You're always cheating.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.665
I'm only cheating if you lose.

21:28.962 --> 21:30.303
Daddy!

21:50.081 --> 21:51.674
No!

21:51.777 --> 21:53.086
Daddy!

21:57.696 --> 21:58.940
Amy?

21:59.041 --> 22:00.863
Amy, what the hell happened?

22:00.961 --> 22:02.138
What the hell happened?

22:02.241 --> 22:04.445
How did she get in the water?

22:04.545 --> 22:05.690
Are you okay?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.418
You're gonna be okay, Amy.
We're gonna get you out.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.014
You did this?
Did you do this, Dan?

22:09.120 --> 22:09.981
Are you all right?

22:10.080 --> 22:11.738
We just jumped in the water.

22:11.841 --> 22:13.018
What's wrong with her?

22:13.120 --> 22:14.462
Is she gonna be all right?

22:14.560 --> 22:16.054
You're gonna be okay, Amy.
We're gonna get you out.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.654
Where's the ladder?

22:17.760 --> 22:19.701
Where's the ladder?
The ladder?

22:19.808 --> 22:21.335
Should be...

22:22.911 --> 22:24.700
Where's the fucking ladder, Dan?

22:24.800 --> 22:26.523
I think it's on the other side.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.232
It's not on the other side.

22:30.335 --> 22:31.229
Or the back.

22:31.327 --> 22:33.083
There's no fucking ladder.

22:44.415 --> 22:45.724
Get out and help me up.

22:47.678 --> 22:49.501
Any second.

22:49.598 --> 22:51.092
We're gonna get you back in the boat.

22:51.199 --> 22:52.060
Real fast.

22:52.159 --> 22:53.981
Relax.

22:54.079 --> 22:56.664
We're gonna get back on that boat
real fast, okay?

23:06.717 --> 23:08.059
We gotta find the lowest point.

23:08.158 --> 23:09.085
There!

23:09.182 --> 23:10.676
No?

23:13.918 --> 23:15.161
Fuck!

23:16.477 --> 23:18.004
We gotta get to
the lowest point.

23:18.109 --> 23:19.003
Higher, come on!

23:19.101 --> 23:20.530
<i># Frere Jacques #</i>

23:20.637 --> 23:22.645
<i># Dormez-vous? #</i>

23:22.749 --> 23:25.138
<i>- Come on, Zach!
- # Dormez-vous? #</i>

23:25.245 --> 23:27.350
<i>- # Sonnez les matines #
- Hey, let's try...</i>

23:27.453 --> 23:28.565
<i># Sonnez les matines #</i>

23:28.669 --> 23:30.524
- Maybe...
- # Ding, dang, dong #

23:30.621 --> 23:31.416
Zach, what about that?

23:31.517 --> 23:32.411
Damn it!

23:32.509 --> 23:33.970
Zach?

23:34.077 --> 23:35.254
We got a rudder right there
where the line is.

23:35.357 --> 23:36.601
How's that look, Dan?

23:38.237 --> 23:40.954
Fuck!

23:41.053 --> 23:42.459
- It's too high!
- Come on, Dan!

23:42.556 --> 23:45.240
<i># Dormez-vous? #</i>

23:45.340 --> 23:47.064

# Ding dang dong,
ding dang dong #

23:53.692 --> 23:55.634
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.534
How are you?

24:01.595 --> 24:02.937
Using what? Water?

24:03.036 --> 24:04.530
At least we're trying
to think of something.

24:04.635 --> 24:05.563
I'm thirsty.

24:06.876 --> 24:08.217
I want to get back on.

24:08.315 --> 24:10.486
We'll find a way.

24:18.075 --> 24:19.089
Fuck!

24:19.195 --> 24:21.496
Sar... Sarah?

24:21.594 --> 24:22.804
Oh, she'll be fine.

24:22.906 --> 24:24.848
She could sleep
through a hurricane...

24:24.955 --> 24:26.515
And my crappy singing.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.235
You know that.

24:44.474 --> 24:45.718
A little higher!

24:52.313 --> 24:54.931
I want to get out now, Dan!

24:55.034 --> 24:56.440
I'm getting cold.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.175
Dan, help me!

25:01.273 --> 25:02.418
Don't leave me alone.

25:05.273 --> 25:07.247
I'm tired and I'm cold

25:07.353 --> 25:09.491
and I don't want to drown.

25:09.592 --> 25:11.250
Come here.
Come here.

25:11.353 --> 25:12.847
That better?

25:12.953 --> 25:14.196
You all right?

25:16.153 --> 25:17.494
You look pretty silly with that thing.

25:18.552 --> 25:20.275
L... I know.

25:22.712 --> 25:24.916
I'm gonna have to
take it for a bit, okay?

25:29.432 --> 25:30.447
Come on, bro.

25:30.552 --> 25:31.479
Push!

25:34.328 --> 25:35.735
Too fucking slippery, man!

25:35.831 --> 25:37.489
I'm holding it the best I can, bro.

25:37.591 --> 25:38.769
Do it again.
Come on.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.530
Yes! Yes!

25:40.631 --> 25:42.453
Yes! Yes!

25:43.671 --> 25:45.493
The air, bro.
We're losing the air.

25:45.591 --> 25:46.998
Fuck.

25:59.670 --> 26:02.256
This was supposed to be fun.

26:02.358 --> 26:03.787
I'm sorry.

26:05.270 --> 26:07.244
Well, there's a way.

26:07.350 --> 26:08.910
There must be.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.564
I don't believe it!

26:11.670 --> 26:13.012
How could you be so stupid?

26:13.110 --> 26:14.571
Would you get off my back?!

26:14.678 --> 26:15.725
I said I was sorry!

26:15.829 --> 26:16.844
Oh, you did?

26:16.949 --> 26:18.772
All right, everybody
just fuckin' relax.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.008
Okay, it can't be this hard.
We'll get on this fucker.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.571
All right?

26:23.669 --> 26:25.163
What you got?

26:25.270 --> 26:26.611
Might be able to grab this.

26:26.709 --> 26:28.116
Hell, yeah, you can reach that!

26:34.389 --> 26:35.883
Gotta time it with the wind.

26:35.988 --> 26:37.395
You're really close.

26:41.236 --> 26:42.349
Yes!

26:48.788 --> 26:49.649
Yes! Nice!

26:49.748 --> 26:51.025
Nice, nice!

26:51.124 --> 26:52.531
Yes, yes, yes!

26:56.564 --> 26:57.491
Damn it!

26:57.588 --> 26:58.832
Damn it!

27:02.867 --> 27:04.428
I don't deserve this.

27:17.108 --> 27:18.449
Fuck it.

27:18.547 --> 27:20.270
We'll think of something.

27:32.147 --> 27:33.324
Hey, girl.

27:33.427 --> 27:35.794
Glad to have you back.

27:38.386 --> 27:40.906
It would be funny
if it weren't so serious, huh?

27:43.666 --> 27:44.681
How's she doing?

27:44.786 --> 27:45.735
She's all right.

27:45.842 --> 27:47.086
Give me your mask.

27:47.186 --> 27:49.324
How are you doing?

27:49.426 --> 27:50.833
Okay, good.

27:52.146 --> 27:53.869
We'll get you out of this water.

27:59.985 --> 28:01.807
Hey.

28:01.905 --> 28:03.399
Any of you guys got a cigarette?

28:05.425 --> 28:08.207
Listen, I smoke,
like, 40 packs a day.

28:08.305 --> 28:09.646
My lungs are trash.

28:09.745 --> 28:10.923
You don't see me going under.

28:11.024 --> 28:13.326
Right?

28:13.425 --> 28:15.726
It's a lot harder to
drown than you think.

28:15.824 --> 28:17.963
You'll be okay.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.723
Michelle, we'll be fine.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.068
Thank you.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.048
Come on.

28:28.145 --> 28:29.159
Let's move around a little.

28:29.264 --> 28:30.125
What was that for?

28:30.224 --> 28:31.085
We'll get the blood flowing.

28:31.184 --> 28:32.045
That'll warm us up.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.158
For being here.

28:33.264 --> 28:35.086
We should look
for some other boats.

28:35.184 --> 28:37.158
There must be
some around, right?

28:37.264 --> 28:38.441
Absolutely.

28:38.544 --> 28:39.405
Somebody will find us.

28:53.583 --> 28:55.143
You all right?

28:57.743 --> 28:59.150
Not really.

29:00.463 --> 29:02.023
I'll make it up to you.

29:08.238 --> 29:09.100
Something just touched my leg!

29:09.198 --> 29:10.627
What the fuck was it?

29:10.735 --> 29:11.596
What?

29:12.655 --> 29:14.061
I don't know.
There it is again!

29:14.158 --> 29:15.402
There it is!

29:15.502 --> 29:16.909
A shark!
I know it's a shark!

29:19.662 --> 29:20.523
Okay. Okay.

29:20.622 --> 29:21.483
Just calm down, okay?

29:55.341 --> 29:56.584
What do you see?

29:58.860 --> 30:01.478
Maybe we should
kick our legs...

30:01.580 --> 30:03.074
Scare it away.

30:03.180 --> 30:04.741
Or piss it off!

30:34.795 --> 30:36.486
All right, nobody's bleeding.

30:36.586 --> 30:38.015
It ain't a shark.

30:39.339 --> 30:40.353
How do you know?

30:40.459 --> 30:41.636
We're still here, aren't we?

30:41.738 --> 30:43.396
Yeah, that's the problem, Dan.

30:43.499 --> 30:44.676
I didn't plan for this.

30:44.778 --> 30:45.639
No shit.

30:45.738 --> 30:48.455
Don't you do some sort of
pre-flight check, like a pilot...

30:48.554 --> 30:50.277
Have some sort of
emergency backup plans?

30:50.378 --> 30:51.654
Obviously not.

30:51.754 --> 30:52.998
Isn't that standard?

30:53.098 --> 30:54.440
Hey...

30:54.538 --> 30:56.392
Who died and made you
captain fucking Nemo?

30:56.489 --> 30:58.856
You didn't notice either.

30:58.954 --> 31:00.263
None of you did.

31:01.257 --> 31:02.435
It's your boat, Dan,

31:02.538 --> 31:04.993
not mine.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.715
If it weren't for you, Dan,
Amy would be up there,

31:07.817 --> 31:09.159
and we wouldn't
be here right now.

31:09.257 --> 31:10.719
Look...

31:10.825 --> 31:13.160
I said I was sorry, okay?

31:13.257 --> 31:14.916
I should have checked.

31:15.017 --> 31:16.359
I should have checked.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.504
I should have checked!

31:17.608 --> 31:18.917
What do you want me to say?

31:19.017 --> 31:20.643
I didn't think.
I made a mistake!

31:20.744 --> 31:23.614
You spend millions on a boat,
but you don't think?

31:25.577 --> 31:27.103
I need some space.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.353
Well, that's great!

31:28.457 --> 31:30.431
We got loads of it out here, man!

31:30.537 --> 31:32.195
You're MacGyver.

31:32.296 --> 31:34.271
Why don't you build something?

31:34.377 --> 31:37.060
Yeah. Why not pull
a 747 out of your ass

31:37.160 --> 31:38.337
and fly us all out of here?

31:45.896 --> 31:50.173
There has to be a way,
'cause Sarah's still up there.

32:10.855 --> 32:12.033
I feel cold.

32:12.134 --> 32:13.695
I can't move my legs anymore.

32:16.134 --> 32:18.239
Whoa! Whoa!

32:18.342 --> 32:19.203
Please! Please!

32:19.302 --> 32:20.512
Help!

32:20.614 --> 32:24.192
Listen!

32:24.294 --> 32:25.309
You give me a minute?

32:25.414 --> 32:26.591
I need some time to think.

32:40.614 --> 32:41.955
Jesus!

32:42.053 --> 32:43.068
What are you doing?

32:43.173 --> 32:45.475
Michelle, what are you doing?

32:45.573 --> 32:48.475
I'm just trying to stay afloat!

32:48.581 --> 32:50.075
Why does she get the jacket?

32:50.181 --> 32:51.391
I need it, too!

32:51.493 --> 32:52.354
Stop it!

32:52.453 --> 32:53.881
We can...
We can share it!

32:53.989 --> 32:55.483
Michelle!

32:55.589 --> 32:56.898
Get ahold of yourself!

33:01.284 --> 33:03.226
What is this?

33:03.332 --> 33:05.471
Best friends stick together forever?

33:08.932 --> 33:10.459
I'm a person, too.

33:16.772 --> 33:18.746
I just don't want to die out here!

33:18.852 --> 33:20.827
I don't... I don't want to die!

33:20.932 --> 33:22.110
I don't want to die!

33:22.211 --> 33:24.186
It's okay. It's okay!

33:24.291 --> 33:25.469
It's okay. Come on.

33:25.572 --> 33:27.230
- I can't!
- Come on!

33:27.331 --> 33:29.470
It's fine.
Trust me.

33:29.572 --> 33:30.848
Come on, Michelle.
Trust me.

33:30.947 --> 33:32.354
Okay.

33:32.452 --> 33:33.793
Now breathe.

33:33.891 --> 33:34.752
Breathe with me, okay?

33:36.771 --> 33:38.593
Breathe.

33:38.691 --> 33:39.868
There you go.

33:39.971 --> 33:41.313
There you go, see?

33:41.410 --> 33:42.905
See, you're gonna be fine.

33:43.011 --> 33:44.026
Trust me.

33:44.130 --> 33:46.269
Okay, now, I want
you to breathe, Michelle.

33:46.370 --> 33:48.193
Just breathe.

33:48.290 --> 33:49.697
Breathe with me.

33:52.930 --> 33:54.490
You're gonna be okay.

33:56.130 --> 33:57.374
There you go.

34:05.730 --> 34:07.388
Our father,

34:07.490 --> 34:09.791
Who art in heaven,

34:09.889 --> 34:12.344
Hallowed be thy name...

34:15.650 --> 34:18.367
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

34:18.465 --> 34:20.853
On Earth as it is in Heaven...

34:25.569 --> 34:28.667
Give us this day
our daily bread...

34:32.128 --> 34:34.746
And forgive us our trespasses,

34:34.849 --> 34:38.143
As we forgive those
who trespass against us,

34:38.239 --> 34:41.469
And lead us not
into temptation...

34:44.128 --> 34:46.495
But deliver us from ev... evil.

34:49.888 --> 34:51.295
For thine...

34:55.007 --> 34:56.415
Is the kingdom...

34:58.848 --> 35:00.342
The power...

35:02.847 --> 35:04.407
And the glory.

35:05.887 --> 35:07.294
Amen.

35:08.927 --> 35:10.814
Save your breath, Michelle.

35:14.207 --> 35:15.767
It doesn't hurt to ask.

35:17.406 --> 35:18.268
Yeah.

35:18.366 --> 35:21.148
Blessed are those
who ask for nothing...

35:21.246 --> 35:23.134
For they shall never
be disappointed.

35:25.406 --> 35:26.421
What?

35:26.526 --> 35:28.021
He lets millions of
people die every day.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.784
Children die.

35:29.886 --> 35:31.609
What makes you think
he's gonna save us?

35:34.046 --> 35:35.606
Well, I ain't no saint...

35:36.926 --> 35:38.900
But I'd like to think
that there's something...

35:39.006 --> 35:42.421
Something bigger out there...
I don't know.

35:42.525 --> 35:45.460
Because if there isn't...

35:45.565 --> 35:46.972
we're all fucked.

35:48.893 --> 35:50.748
Mothers lift cars off their children

35:50.845 --> 35:52.950
when they get into an accident.

35:53.053 --> 35:56.763
And people, they cure themselves
of terminal illness.

35:56.861 --> 35:58.322
It happens, okay?

35:59.805 --> 36:01.943
Maybe it can happen to us.

36:02.045 --> 36:03.223
It has to happen!

36:17.404 --> 36:19.292
I'm so fucking cold!

36:20.764 --> 36:22.651
My hands are totally numb.

36:29.403 --> 36:32.502
"Water, water everywhere, and...

36:32.603 --> 36:34.578
not a drop to drink."

36:34.684 --> 36:36.822
A 75-foot nautical wet dream.

36:36.923 --> 36:38.417
Shit!

36:38.523 --> 36:39.701
Lucky me.

36:39.803 --> 36:41.842
I'm just going to the Bahamas, man!

36:41.947 --> 36:43.856
I'm so thirsty.

36:43.963 --> 36:46.167
Boats are bound
to come by sooner or later.

36:47.803 --> 36:49.526
Somebody will find us.

37:30.361 --> 37:32.248
It's coming from the other side!

37:48.761 --> 37:50.516
That's my phone!

37:50.616 --> 37:51.860
That's my phone!

37:51.960 --> 37:53.040
Get it!

37:53.144 --> 37:54.093
Get it, get it, get it!

37:54.200 --> 37:55.215
Answer it!

37:55.320 --> 37:56.597
Answer the phone!

37:56.695 --> 37:57.557
Careful, don't let it get wet!

37:57.655 --> 37:58.735
- I can reach that.
- Answer it.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.366
Answer the phone!

38:05.655 --> 38:08.525
Answer it!
Answer it!

38:08.631 --> 38:11.086
- Ring, baby!
- Quick!

38:13.431 --> 38:14.892
Erica!

38:14.999 --> 38:16.373
Happy birthday, baby brother.

38:16.471 --> 38:18.413
# For he's a jolly good fellow... #

38:18.519 --> 38:19.697
Erica!

38:19.799 --> 38:20.976
# Which nobody can deny #

38:21.079 --> 38:23.534
Erica? Anybody?
Can you hear us?

38:23.638 --> 38:25.067
Help! We're drowning!
Please!

38:25.175 --> 38:26.036
Shut up!

38:26.135 --> 38:27.215
Erica?

38:27.318 --> 38:28.463
- Zach, can you hear me?
- Erica, hello?

38:28.567 --> 38:29.777
Zach, can you hear me?

38:29.879 --> 38:32.148
Erica! Erica?

38:33.238 --> 38:34.732
- Help us!
- Hello?

38:34.839 --> 38:36.148
What did you do?

38:36.246 --> 38:37.108
Nothing!

38:37.206 --> 38:38.100
You hung up on her!

38:38.198 --> 38:39.856
I did not!

38:39.958 --> 38:42.740
- What happened?
- Give it to me!

38:42.838 --> 38:44.015
Try to call her back.

38:44.118 --> 38:45.230
Bullshit!
Call 9-1-1!

38:45.334 --> 38:46.894
Come on.
Come on.

38:46.998 --> 38:48.492
Please!
God damn it!

38:48.597 --> 38:49.775
Fuck!

38:49.878 --> 38:51.284
No!

38:54.677 --> 38:56.084
Zach.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.860
We might have been able to fix it.

39:05.716 --> 39:07.058
It was soaking wet, Dan.

39:07.157 --> 39:08.499
It was fucking fried.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.484
Are you sure about that?

39:18.676 --> 39:19.691
Maybe she heard something.

39:19.797 --> 39:21.836
Heard what? "Hello?"

39:23.476 --> 39:25.778
How's that supposed to help?

39:25.876 --> 39:27.763
You didn't even tell her
where we were!

39:32.755 --> 39:34.316
I'm serious!

39:37.876 --> 39:39.599
We're gonna drown out here.

39:41.235 --> 39:42.729
How come nobody's
listening to me?

39:42.836 --> 39:44.330
We're gonna fucking die out here!

39:44.435 --> 39:45.645
Fucking die, you idiot!

39:45.747 --> 39:46.729
Michelle, shut up!

39:46.836 --> 39:48.177
No, you shut the fuck up!

39:48.275 --> 39:49.322
Hey, come on!

39:49.427 --> 39:50.888
Hey! Hey!

39:50.995 --> 39:52.172
Knock it off!

39:52.275 --> 39:53.933
Let's keep it together!

39:54.035 --> 39:54.983
It's bad enough out here.

39:55.091 --> 39:55.952
We don't need to be

39:56.051 --> 39:57.457
starting in on each
other every second.

40:14.194 --> 40:15.852
Leg cramp!

40:15.954 --> 40:16.815
Which one?

40:16.914 --> 40:17.775
The left.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.532
Hold it up, hold it up.

40:19.633 --> 40:21.608
Okay?

40:23.633 --> 40:25.291
That's better.

40:25.393 --> 40:26.800
Thanks.

40:49.233 --> 40:50.662
I have an idea.

40:50.768 --> 40:52.492
What?

40:52.592 --> 40:53.934
Let's make a rope.

40:54.033 --> 40:55.210
Come on.

40:55.312 --> 40:56.937
Nude up, everybody.

40:58.992 --> 41:00.518
Nude up.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.085
Another one of your perverted stunts?

41:02.192 --> 41:04.014
Give me some credit, Lauren.

41:04.112 --> 41:05.453
We make a rope...

41:05.552 --> 41:06.501
out of our shorts.

41:06.608 --> 41:07.688
Toss it up there,

41:07.791 --> 41:09.766
we'll hook it onto something.

41:09.871 --> 41:11.213
I hate to say it, but...

41:11.312 --> 41:12.327
It might actually work.

41:12.431 --> 41:14.089
Chop chop, people.

41:14.192 --> 41:15.501
I'm just...

41:15.600 --> 41:17.290
I'm so cold.

41:17.391 --> 41:19.049
You're wearing dental floss, sweetheart,

41:19.151 --> 41:20.492
not a ski parka.

41:20.591 --> 41:21.998
Would you rather drown?

41:35.886 --> 41:37.195
Oh, shit!

41:40.238 --> 41:41.448
Hey!

41:46.350 --> 41:47.594
Hey, stop!

41:47.693 --> 41:49.635
Stop!

41:57.549 --> 41:58.564
Over here!

41:58.669 --> 41:59.847
Hey! Stop!

41:59.950 --> 42:01.608
- Oh, god!
- Stop!

42:01.709 --> 42:03.848
Stop!

42:03.949 --> 42:04.811
No!
Come on!

42:09.069 --> 42:11.370
Stop!

42:11.469 --> 42:13.803
Stop. Please.

42:22.508 --> 42:23.817
She'll be awake soon.

42:28.044 --> 42:29.605
I need the knife.

42:29.708 --> 42:30.569
Okay.

42:30.668 --> 42:32.490
Here, I'll hold that.

42:32.588 --> 42:34.890
- Careful.
- Yeah.

42:34.988 --> 42:36.646
Okay.

42:36.748 --> 42:37.609
Should I start tying?

42:37.708 --> 42:38.952
Yes.

42:41.707 --> 42:43.365
Is there any way to
get in from below?

42:43.468 --> 42:44.875
How should I know?

42:46.348 --> 42:47.362
You own a boat like this,

42:47.467 --> 42:48.482
you don't know anything about it?

42:48.587 --> 42:49.765
It's a fucking yacht, Jimmy.

42:49.867 --> 42:50.882
Remember?

42:50.987 --> 42:52.810
If it looks good, I buy it, okay?

42:52.907 --> 42:54.249
Is that the answer you're looking for?

42:54.347 --> 42:55.907
'Cause it's the only one I got right now.

42:58.667 --> 43:00.227
I need the mask.

43:03.946 --> 43:05.353
Thanks.

43:13.546 --> 43:14.407
Hey, Zach.

43:14.506 --> 43:16.961
You done with the knife?

43:17.067 --> 43:19.368
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

43:19.466 --> 43:20.960
Let's tie this.

43:21.066 --> 43:21.959
Tie it here.

43:22.058 --> 43:23.520
Yeah.
It looks good.

43:23.626 --> 43:24.968
Hello.

43:25.066 --> 43:27.204
I am James Cousteau,

43:27.306 --> 43:28.483
explorer of the deep.

43:28.586 --> 43:29.764
Is it a good knot?

43:29.865 --> 43:31.043
You gotta make sure
it's a good knot.

43:31.146 --> 43:32.160
I'm gonna go take
a peek below.

43:32.266 --> 43:33.760
Is it strong?

43:33.865 --> 43:35.043
It's gotta be able to hold me.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.007
You all right?

43:36.106 --> 43:37.928
I'll be fine.

43:39.146 --> 43:41.120
Give me the bikini top.

43:44.105 --> 43:46.406
Tie knots... lf you can.

43:46.505 --> 43:48.032
I may have dropped something.

43:48.137 --> 43:50.144
This is strong.

44:20.776 --> 44:22.085
Wring it out.

44:22.184 --> 44:25.151
We have to wring it... Yeah.

44:25.255 --> 44:27.044
Go to your left.

44:29.063 --> 44:30.405
Back me up.

44:30.503 --> 44:31.518
You okay?

44:31.623 --> 44:32.484
Wait... wait...

44:32.583 --> 44:33.444
Here, pass it to Lauren.

44:33.543 --> 44:34.558
Lauren?

44:34.663 --> 44:35.678
Someone hold it here.

44:35.783 --> 44:37.125
I got it.

44:37.223 --> 44:38.237
Thank you so much.

44:38.343 --> 44:39.520
Wait... Wait.

44:39.623 --> 44:42.078
Oh, that's it.
One...

44:43.622 --> 44:45.989
Two, three!

44:49.862 --> 44:51.204
Give me a "one, two, three."

44:51.302 --> 44:52.163
Okay.

44:52.262 --> 44:53.439
Just a straight "one, two, three."

44:53.542 --> 44:55.517
Okay.

44:55.622 --> 44:56.483
Fuck!

44:56.582 --> 44:57.597
Here, wring it out a little.

44:57.702 --> 44:59.677
Wring it out.

44:59.782 --> 45:01.124
You're getting this too wet.

45:01.222 --> 45:02.465
It's too wet, look.

45:11.621 --> 45:13.443
It seems so easy.

45:13.541 --> 45:15.035
Okay, you can do it.

45:15.141 --> 45:16.483
On three.
You can do it, Zach.

45:16.581 --> 45:17.759
One...

45:17.861 --> 45:18.876
To the left a little.

45:18.981 --> 45:19.843
Come on, come on.

45:19.941 --> 45:23.007
One, two, three.

45:25.701 --> 45:26.945
Yeah!

45:45.700 --> 45:48.155
You can do it.
You can do it.

45:48.260 --> 45:49.405
Come on, Zach.

45:49.507 --> 45:51.198
You can get it, man.

45:51.300 --> 45:53.023
Take it slow.

45:59.779 --> 46:01.339
Careful...

46:18.978 --> 46:20.472
Son of a bitch!

46:20.578 --> 46:22.171
- Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes!

46:22.274 --> 46:24.030
Oh, my God!

46:43.810 --> 46:44.671
God damn it.

46:50.657 --> 46:52.315
Yo, man.

46:52.417 --> 46:54.239
What's that?

46:54.337 --> 46:56.311
I don't know.

46:56.417 --> 46:59.002
There's a square cut in the side
of your boat, bro.

46:59.105 --> 47:01.472
James!

47:30.496 --> 47:32.951
What happened? Wh...

47:33.055 --> 47:33.916
What are you...

47:34.015 --> 47:35.837
Are you all right?

47:35.935 --> 47:37.429
Lauren!

47:39.295 --> 47:41.596
Lauren!
What happened?

47:45.214 --> 47:46.392
James.

47:46.495 --> 47:49.113
Hey, James...
Lauren?

47:49.214 --> 47:50.709
Is he okay? James?

47:50.814 --> 47:51.829
Is he okay?

47:51.934 --> 47:54.389
- James?
- What happened?

47:54.495 --> 47:56.153
Support his head.

47:56.254 --> 47:57.116
What happened?

47:57.214 --> 47:58.873
Support his head.

47:58.974 --> 48:00.054
Keep it supported.

48:04.734 --> 48:08.279
I think he has a skull fracture.

48:08.382 --> 48:09.276
Jesus Christ.

48:09.374 --> 48:12.789
He needs a hospital
and he needs it fast.

48:12.893 --> 48:14.900
Enough of this bullshit.

48:15.006 --> 48:16.794
James!
James.

48:16.893 --> 48:18.137
Give me the knife.

48:33.916 --> 48:35.378
No!

48:39.164 --> 48:41.106
Dan! What is wrong with you?

48:41.212 --> 48:42.423
No!

48:42.524 --> 48:44.313
Buy yourself a new toy
when we're out of this mess!

48:44.413 --> 48:45.427
What the hell are you doing?

48:55.483 --> 48:56.825
No!

49:09.467 --> 49:10.711
Oh, my God!

49:12.251 --> 49:13.909
Couldn't you just leave him alone?

49:16.250 --> 49:17.745
Give me some of the rope.

49:17.851 --> 49:18.712
God damn it, Dan, now!

49:18.811 --> 49:20.883
Christ, I'm... I'm sorry...

49:20.987 --> 49:22.067
What did you do?

49:22.170 --> 49:23.185
It's just a stupid fucking boat!

49:23.290 --> 49:24.697
What's wrong with you?

49:28.090 --> 49:30.457
This is gonna attract
everything, isn't it?

49:41.530 --> 49:43.602
He was just trying
to get us out of here.

49:50.329 --> 49:51.988
Sarah...

49:52.089 --> 49:53.747
Sarah, I'm here!

49:53.849 --> 49:56.500
Mommy and daddy are here!

49:56.601 --> 49:58.543
Sarah!

49:58.649 --> 49:59.510
I'm here!

49:59.609 --> 50:02.423
Mommy and daddy
are here! L...

50:06.424 --> 50:07.831
I'm sorry.

50:10.008 --> 50:11.023
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

50:11.128 --> 50:12.754
Easiest thing in the world.

50:12.856 --> 50:14.449
It means nothing!

50:15.768 --> 50:17.175
Where's Michelle?

50:18.489 --> 50:20.790
Michelle!

50:26.520 --> 50:27.730
Oh, my God.

50:30.648 --> 50:31.509
Michelle.

52:31.122 --> 52:32.529
How you doing?

52:38.002 --> 52:39.889
I feel cold.

52:45.969 --> 52:47.879
Well, we are at sea.

52:50.642 --> 52:52.202
Hold your head up, babe.

53:03.761 --> 53:04.938
It's fine.

53:05.041 --> 53:07.659
Maybe 20 years from now...

53:07.761 --> 53:09.964
we'll look back on this and laugh.

53:24.721 --> 53:26.543
It's too bad...

53:26.640 --> 53:29.423
that Dan forgot his camera.

53:29.520 --> 53:30.927
His video camera.

53:33.360 --> 53:34.767
Yeah.

53:36.399 --> 53:39.661
Remember...
El Matador beach?

53:39.760 --> 53:42.280
Of course.

53:42.383 --> 53:44.139
You were so...

53:44.239 --> 53:45.962
So sexy that day.

53:51.599 --> 53:53.487
Now I know you're delirious.

53:56.399 --> 53:58.821
How much seawater did you drink?

54:03.119 --> 54:05.323
I should've told you that then.

54:08.719 --> 54:13.475
You can tell me
when we get back to shore, okay?

54:15.086 --> 54:16.035
Okay?

54:18.958 --> 54:20.365
Okay.

54:27.277 --> 54:28.684
Zach?

54:33.677 --> 54:35.172
Zach, breathe!

54:35.277 --> 54:36.771
Zach, wake up!

54:36.877 --> 54:38.665
Help me, Amy!

54:38.765 --> 54:40.620
Zach, breathe!
Breathe!

54:40.717 --> 54:43.335
Wake up!
Breathe!

54:43.437 --> 54:44.484
Oh, no!

54:48.237 --> 54:49.960
No!

54:50.957 --> 54:52.779
God damn it!

54:52.877 --> 54:54.186
No!

54:59.724 --> 55:03.237
Is the boat worth more to you
than your friends?

55:05.356 --> 55:07.014
He's dead!

55:07.116 --> 55:08.774
Zach's dead!

55:08.876 --> 55:10.152
Michelle's dead!

55:10.252 --> 55:12.619
But you still got your boat, right?

55:12.715 --> 55:14.439
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

55:14.540 --> 55:15.816
It's a yacht!

55:15.916 --> 55:17.574
It's a fucking yacht, isn't it?

55:17.675 --> 55:18.690
No!

55:18.796 --> 55:20.770
It's a fucking yacht!

55:20.876 --> 55:22.053
It's a fucking yacht!

55:22.155 --> 55:23.170
Fucking yacht!

55:23.275 --> 55:25.414
Stop it!

55:27.915 --> 55:29.573
You're on his side.

55:29.674 --> 55:31.497
No, no!
Of course not.

55:31.594 --> 55:33.798
That's what it looks like to me.

55:33.899 --> 55:35.328
After everything he's done?

55:37.739 --> 55:40.902
Old fires always burn, right?

55:41.002 --> 55:42.912
James... I'm just...

55:43.018 --> 55:45.157
I'm just worried about you.

55:58.473 --> 56:01.255
Most likely to succeed.

56:08.073 --> 56:10.342
I was voted "most likely to succeed"
our senior year.

56:10.441 --> 56:11.237
You guys remember that?

56:11.337 --> 56:15.331
Dan...

56:15.433 --> 56:18.368
I didn't want Zach to hurt it, l...

56:18.473 --> 56:20.677
I couldn't let him hurt it because...

56:24.233 --> 56:26.273
Because it isn't mine.

56:28.073 --> 56:29.447
The boat...

56:30.953 --> 56:32.294
This isn't... This isn't my boat,

56:32.392 --> 56:35.010
This isn't my life.

56:35.112 --> 56:37.250
I couldn't...

56:37.352 --> 56:39.872
I couldn't rent something like this,
let alone buy it.

56:39.976 --> 56:41.405
What?

56:41.512 --> 56:44.382
I don't... I don't invest anything
for anybody.

56:45.832 --> 56:47.806
I'm a fraud.
I'm a...

56:47.912 --> 56:49.089
I'm a monkey in a mailroom.

56:49.192 --> 56:51.264
I'm an errand boy.
I'm nothing.

56:54.311 --> 56:57.028
I told Michelle I was a millionaire.

56:57.127 --> 57:00.356
I told a hundred Michelles
the same thing.

57:02.151 --> 57:05.412
I walk into their bars
in my $2,000 suit

57:05.511 --> 57:08.446
with a picture of my boss' yacht
in my pocket, and l...

57:08.550 --> 57:12.445
I promise to sail
them around the world,

57:12.550 --> 57:14.208
and they always believe me.

57:14.310 --> 57:16.132
You believed me.

57:16.230 --> 57:19.775
And for once, just once...

57:19.878 --> 57:22.114
I wanted to believe it myself.

57:24.390 --> 57:28.351
L... I'm... I'm so sorry.

57:31.430 --> 57:33.950
No!

57:35.558 --> 57:37.729
Jesus Christ, I killed him.

57:44.549 --> 57:46.109
I killed them.

57:52.069 --> 57:53.792
Oh, God,
it's all my fault.

58:12.708 --> 58:16.024
I loved him
and I never got to tell him.

58:16.132 --> 58:18.368
He knew.
He knew.

58:18.468 --> 58:19.329
Let him go.

58:19.428 --> 58:21.403
No, no!

58:21.507 --> 58:23.809
Okay.

58:23.907 --> 58:24.955
Okay.

58:29.028 --> 58:30.915
God, no!

59:24.705 --> 59:27.902
Guys, do you think we're going to
know each other forever?

59:51.104 --> 59:53.886
Is Sarah still asleep?

59:53.983 --> 59:55.544
I think so.

59:59.712 --> 01:00:01.719
She'll be getting up
pretty soon, won't she?

01:00:01.823 --> 01:00:03.317
Probably.

01:00:03.423 --> 01:00:05.561
We'll be back
on board by then.

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:16.926
I'll check
on her before I go to bed.

01:00:17.022 --> 01:00:18.583
Okay.

01:00:22.462 --> 01:00:24.055
She's a good girl, isn't she?

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:27.964
Just like her mom.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.922
I think I'm gonna...

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.541
I'm gonna go for a little... swim.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.955
To see if I can
make it back to shore.

01:01:20.059 --> 01:01:22.034
It's too far.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.765
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

01:01:26.939 --> 01:01:29.078
I'm not gonna die
treading water, man.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.586
That's just not me.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.906
It's James, he's just...

01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:36.432
There's pressure on his brain, Amy.

01:01:36.539 --> 01:01:37.783
Just...

01:01:47.739 --> 01:01:49.048
See you soon.

01:02:12.857 --> 01:02:13.872
You're gonna make it.

01:02:13.977 --> 01:02:16.595
Yeah, so are you.

01:02:16.697 --> 01:02:18.737
- Okay.
- Take care, okay?

01:02:23.737 --> 01:02:26.159
You look after them
while I'm gone, yeah?

01:02:26.265 --> 01:02:27.377
Yes, ma'am.

01:02:29.977 --> 01:02:31.538
Wish me luck then.

01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:34.577
You won't need it.

01:03:16.535 --> 01:03:17.942
Sarah!

01:03:20.215 --> 01:03:21.163
Baby girl!

01:03:23.094 --> 01:03:24.687
Sarah...

01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:26.100
Can you hear me?
I'm here.

01:03:28.694 --> 01:03:30.450
Your mommy's here,
l... can you hear me?

01:03:33.079 --> 01:03:35.795
Please stop crying,
you hear me?

01:03:38.134 --> 01:03:40.022
I'm here, I just... I can't...

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:54.508
I thought I heard
Sarah crying.

01:03:58.613 --> 01:04:02.028
She's hungry.

01:04:03.253 --> 01:04:04.267
How are you...

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.616
How are you doing?

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.053
I'm all right.

01:04:13.972 --> 01:04:15.019
Dan?

01:04:17.972 --> 01:04:20.012
I can't move my legs anymore.

01:04:30.835 --> 01:04:33.552
The square cut on
the side of your boat.

01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:36.205
He was just
trying to get us out of here.

01:04:49.971 --> 01:04:50.986
What are you doing?

01:04:51.091 --> 01:04:53.546
L... I want...

01:04:53.651 --> 01:04:56.018
Try to find the knife.

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:00.432
Do you know how far we've drifted?

01:05:00.531 --> 01:05:03.313
I got... I gotta do something.

01:05:03.411 --> 01:05:05.385
No.

01:05:05.491 --> 01:05:07.694
You don't. I do.

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:11.856
I'll find it.

01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:16.272
Okay.

01:06:05.008 --> 01:06:07.147
James.

01:06:17.647 --> 01:06:19.207
I feel tired.

01:06:23.407 --> 01:06:25.130
Really tired.

01:06:29.487 --> 01:06:31.559
My head hurts.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:45.453
I think I'm gonna
go to bed, all right?

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:51.693
Don't go to sleep yet.

01:06:53.806 --> 01:06:56.010
You wait up for me, okay?

01:06:57.261 --> 01:06:58.723
You stay awake.

01:07:00.686 --> 01:07:01.863
Sure.

01:07:01.965 --> 01:07:02.892
Okay.

01:07:02.989 --> 01:07:05.509
Pretty sure...

01:07:07.405 --> 01:07:09.380
I'll wait up for you any day.

01:07:09.485 --> 01:07:10.564
Okay.

01:07:17.645 --> 01:07:19.783
Yeah.

01:07:19.885 --> 01:07:20.900
Yeah.

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:42.247
Don't cry.

01:07:43.724 --> 01:07:45.447
I'm sorry.

01:07:50.443 --> 01:07:52.745
Don't cry.

01:07:52.843 --> 01:07:54.566
It's okay.

01:08:32.682 --> 01:08:34.340
James!

01:08:35.721 --> 01:08:37.216
Drink.

01:08:37.321 --> 01:08:38.728
It's raining.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.600
James.

01:10:14.917 --> 01:10:18.779
It's okay.
It's okay.
