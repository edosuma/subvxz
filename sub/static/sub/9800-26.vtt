00:13.758 --> 00:15.457
I'm so excited, Marlene.

00:15.507 --> 00:17.118
This'll solve all your problems.

00:17.168 --> 00:20.194
Um, not sure what problems I'm having, but okay.

00:21.813 --> 00:24.813
Meet the love-u-lator 3000.

00:26.439 --> 00:28.217
Using scientifically proven methods,

00:28.267 --> 00:32.659
it will scientifically locate your ideal match according to science.

00:32.803 --> 00:33.964
Yeah, good.

00:34.389 --> 00:35.765
Real quick, one thing...

00:35.815 --> 00:36.813
What?

00:36.814 --> 00:38.130
I mentioned science, right?

00:38.729 --> 00:40.811
It willll find your dream date, Marlene.

00:40.812 --> 00:42.190
You'll be lonely no more.

00:42.191 --> 00:43.517
Who said I was lonely?

00:43.518 --> 00:46.281
You didn't have to.
We're sensitive.

00:46.807 --> 00:47.613
Mostly.

00:47.663 --> 00:50.890
We just figured a single otter in the big city

00:50.940 --> 00:51.832
is...

00:51.882 --> 00:56.266
lonely!
The crushing solitude is eating you alive.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.227
Um, no.
No, I'm... I'm good.

00:59.277 --> 01:03.168
And why are you guys suddenly interested in my social life anyway?

01:04.843 --> 01:09.292
All right, we needed a guinea pig, and you were the closest species.

01:09.342 --> 01:10.441
Genetically speaking.

01:10.491 --> 01:14.544
Kowalski's invention works.
Think of all the defense applications.

01:14.545 --> 01:17.908
Defense applications? Of the love-u-lator?

01:17.958 --> 01:20.961
Limitless.
Rico, spit-fishing time.

01:20.962 --> 01:22.826
W-wait, spit wha-ah...

01:30.117 --> 01:35.237
Now that we have a saliva sample, DNA cross-referencing will do its thing.

01:36.666 --> 01:39.383
Your new ??? is... is...

01:39.433 --> 01:40.986
is not in the zoo.

01:40.987 --> 01:43.320
Adjust sensitivity.
Expand search perimeter.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.100
And, uh, try that knob.

01:49.006 --> 01:51.004
There he is. Iin the park.

01:52.414 --> 01:55.314
The lady walks on the wild side.

01:56.130 --> 01:58.144
Okay, let's roll, men.

01:59.737 --> 02:01.849
Guys, I am not looking for a date.

02:01.850 --> 02:05.797
Marlene, this is a scientifically engineered hookup.

02:07.283 --> 02:09.394
Respect the science.

02:10.937 --> 02:12.881
Move out, men. Double time.

02:13.846 --> 02:16.819
I can't wait to meet Marlene's new boyfriend.

02:17.610 --> 02:22.115
Maurice. Those penguins are going to meet Marlene's new boyfriend.

02:22.790 --> 02:23.779
Good for her.

02:23.829 --> 02:25.234
No, not good for her.

02:25.284 --> 02:27.081
She already has a boyfriend.

02:27.131 --> 02:28.140
She does?

02:28.190 --> 02:30.280
Yes, silly. it's me!

02:30.281 --> 02:32.339
You? Let me guess.

02:32.389 --> 02:35.148
Marlene doesn't know you're her boyfriend, right?

02:35.327 --> 02:38.129
Well, I have been meaning to mention it to her.

02:38.130 --> 02:41.338
But, I can see now, I must step up my wooing.

02:41.994 --> 02:45.423
All right. We'll need flowers, candy and...

02:45.458 --> 02:46.889
No, no, no, Maurice.

02:46.890 --> 02:51.462
The only way to win this competition is to eliminate the other competition.

02:52.343 --> 02:55.646
All right. We'll need a sack, clubs and rope.

02:55.696 --> 02:59.416
Yes, Maurice.
Now you are thinking romantically.

03:00.093 --> 03:02.389
He's near. Very near.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.368
In fact, he's here.

03:04.418 --> 03:08.080
Gentlemen, Marlene's perfect match.

03:08.292 --> 03:09.366
Hello.

03:09.515 --> 03:12.367
Oh, no. Not that guy.

03:12.368 --> 03:13.634
What guy?

03:13.797 --> 03:15.572
It's what the love-u-lator says.

03:15.573 --> 03:17.930
Well, maybe Fred is the one.

03:17.931 --> 03:21.639
Private, come on.
Marlene is smart. Fred is...

03:24.355 --> 03:27.774
Yes, but, um... Opposites attract?

03:29.664 --> 03:32.028
Folksy wisdom. Must be true.

03:33.724 --> 03:35.037
Penguins are ridiculous.

03:35.313 --> 03:37.967
Like I need them to set me up.
Come on.

03:38.062 --> 03:39.186
Hello, Marlene.

03:39.792 --> 03:42.819
You guys, hello? I told you, I don't want

03:42.869 --> 03:47.597
Marlene, I am begging you in a hushed whisper, please, do this for me.

03:47.598 --> 03:51.490
I am losing faith in science, and if I don't have science...

03:51.567 --> 03:54.033
I dton't have... I'm sorry.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.836
Okay, Kowalski, Relax.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.275
I will do this for you, but you owe me.

03:59.276 --> 04:02.689
Marlene, this is Fred.
He's a squirrel.

04:02.690 --> 04:05.205
Yeah, yeah. The tail's a giveaway.

04:05.206 --> 04:06.864
Hey, Fred. What's up?

04:07.794 --> 04:11.327
Sky... A few clouds...

04:11.328 --> 04:14.019
Oh, I get it. Up. Yeah.

04:14.069 --> 04:15.481
Well, he's got a sense of humor.

04:15.798 --> 04:18.628
All righty, Fred. Let's get to know you.

04:18.629 --> 04:22.232
What makes Fred tick? 
What does Fred like? What does he dislike?

04:22.233 --> 04:25.982
Oh, I like a lot of things, except the things I don't like.

04:25.983 --> 04:28.548
Stupid things I don't like.

04:29.047 --> 04:31.935
You are really funny.

04:32.256 --> 04:35.872
And... Kind of, sort of cute.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.324
Is this actually working?

04:38.325 --> 04:42.439
Oh, science, I never should have doubted you.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.919
Let's give these lovebirds some alone time.

04:44.920 --> 04:45.941
Roll out.

04:49.065 --> 04:50.421
Oh, Fred.

04:51.389 --> 04:55.730
I so didn't expect this, but I feel like we're...

04:55.731 --> 04:58.293
I don't know, I feel like we're clicking.

04:58.294 --> 04:59.412
Okay.

04:59.462 --> 05:02.408
Hey, when I look in your eyes, you know what I see?

05:02.637 --> 05:03.422
What?

05:03.423 --> 05:04.410
Me.

05:05.490 --> 05:08.516
That is the sweetest thing anyone has ever

05:08.783 --> 05:10.097
ะกould you hold still?

05:10.098 --> 05:12.355
I got some lettuce in my teeth.

05:13.179 --> 05:16.076
Stop, you joker.
I'm being serious.

05:16.077 --> 05:19.092
Okay. Okay, big question.

05:19.385 --> 05:23.509
How do you feel about spanish guitar?

05:24.425 --> 05:27.020
You've got a... a thing on your face.

05:27.070 --> 05:30.576
It's a mole, or... No, maybe a chipmunk or...

05:32.260 --> 05:34.137
I'm a distraction.

05:35.867 --> 05:38.975
Fred? Fred?

05:39.025 --> 05:42.374
And now to check on my little love experiment

05:42.409 --> 05:46.399
and see if the subjects are "digging" each other.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.912
Lemurs stole my date!

05:50.687 --> 05:53.028
Whoa. Where... where are we?

05:53.029 --> 05:55.382
This is the reptile house.

05:55.432 --> 05:58.394
I selected it for, you know, mood.

05:58.777 --> 06:01.363
Mood? Very nice.

06:01.364 --> 06:03.985
No, not nice. Savage.

06:03.986 --> 06:07.652
We are here to fight for Marlene's paw.

06:07.653 --> 06:09.152
It think, she can keep her paw.

06:09.153 --> 06:11.028
I already have four of my own.

06:12.706 --> 06:16.742
Might as well sit down.
This is gonna take a while.

06:17.751 --> 06:19.617
What is it she sees in you?

06:19.667 --> 06:21.551
It cannot be the bushy tail.

06:21.601 --> 06:24.022
My tail is the bushiest.

06:24.023 --> 06:25.936
The shiny fur? No.

06:25.937 --> 06:28.419
This I have as well, you can see.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.019
What do you have that I do not?

06:30.020 --> 06:31.501
Big teeth.

06:31.814 --> 06:33.436
The teeth.

06:34.339 --> 06:36.060
Mine are puny.

06:36.061 --> 06:38.186
They lack pearly magnificence.

06:38.187 --> 06:41.352
Mort, Maurice, give to me your teeth.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.465
Okay.

06:46.373 --> 06:48.719
Now get up on the lemur habitat.
No one's there.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.796
Okay, this... this is crazy.

06:50.797 --> 06:53.889
What could the lemurs possibly want with my boyfriend?

06:53.890 --> 06:55.336
Boyfriend.

06:56.034 --> 06:59.408
Who knows what sick and twisted things they're doing to him.

06:59.409 --> 07:01.114
Rico, tracking mode.

07:09.022 --> 07:11.493
Ooh, he's got something. This way, men.

07:21.626 --> 07:22.897
??? with this.

07:25.684 --> 07:28.699
Um, I'm supposed to do what with this again?

07:29.131 --> 07:30.216
Hit me.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.528
But you're already doing that to yourself.

07:32.529 --> 07:33.257
But...

07:34.325 --> 07:35.165
I told...

07:36.105 --> 07:37.054
Listen to...

07:40.641 --> 07:42.843
Hurry. We've got to find Boo Boo.

07:42.903 --> 07:43.872
Boo Boo?

07:45.297 --> 07:47.194
That's my cute nickname for Fred, you know.

07:47.596 --> 07:49.671
Not that it's any of your business.

07:49.672 --> 07:53.322
Cutesy nicknames. Fantastic.

07:55.575 --> 07:58.790
Come on, you lollygagger.
You're not even trying.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.979
Just put your back into it and swing.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.542
Do what now?

08:02.821 --> 08:04.010
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:04.011 --> 08:07.229
No, that is what you are supposed to be doing.

08:07.230 --> 08:08.666
Nice shot.

08:08.667 --> 08:09.952
Thanks.

08:13.105 --> 08:15.603
We're coming, Fred! We're coming!

08:15.604 --> 08:19.688
I've cracked the love code. Oh, baby!

08:19.689 --> 08:24.416
I will take those showy-offy teeth right out of your nut face.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.852
When I find julien, I am gonna rip him limb from limb,

08:33.903 --> 08:37.208
sew him back together, then rip him apart all over again.

08:38.888 --> 08:40.961
Sounds like someone beat you to it.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.630
Einstein's mullet.

08:46.897 --> 08:50.615
What in the name of all that is decent and good have you done to him?

08:50.616 --> 08:53.168
Nothing. He did it to himself.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.351
Sadly, this is true.

08:55.512 --> 08:58.394
You win, Fred the squirrel.

08:58.395 --> 09:01.140
You may have the paw of the lovely Marlene.

09:01.788 --> 09:04.225
You... you guys were fighting over me?

09:04.226 --> 09:06.268
Julien, I am not some prize.

09:06.318 --> 09:07.113
Yes.

09:07.163 --> 09:10.738
Now that I look you over,
especially from this unflattering angle,

09:10.788 --> 09:13.918
I have decided, you are right.
You are no prize.

09:13.919 --> 09:15.157
Wait, wait, wait. Wh-what?

09:15.207 --> 09:17.335
Maurice, cart me away.

09:21.542 --> 09:24.675
Gently, Maurice. Gently.

09:24.676 --> 09:28.387
So, Fred, how about you show me the town?

09:28.553 --> 09:30.322
It's right over there.

09:30.816 --> 09:32.619
You kidder.

09:33.257 --> 09:34.960
You are kidding, right?

09:38.833 --> 09:41.175
I wonder how the rest of Marlene's date went.

09:41.176 --> 09:44.349
I'm sure it was a many-splendored day.

09:44.399 --> 09:48.679
Well, it had to be.
It was scientifically guaranteed.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.623
Hey, guys.

09:50.673 --> 09:54.258
So, uh, Fred... yeah... Not happening.

09:54.259 --> 09:54.921
What?

09:54.971 --> 09:57.703
Yeah, it turns out what I thought was him being funny

09:57.753 --> 10:00.220
was actually him just being, uh...

10:00.670 --> 10:02.681
Dumb as a sack of hammers?

10:02.682 --> 10:06.981
Let's just say I did not hear spanish guitar when we were together.

10:07.465 --> 10:09.889
But science led us right to him.

10:09.939 --> 10:12.230
Science said he was perfect.

10:12.231 --> 10:15.448
Science! Why have you forsaken me?

10:26.745 --> 10:28.979
Fred, amigo, where have you been?

10:28.980 --> 10:33.167
Hey, Antonio.
I met this girl, but it didn't work out.

10:33.168 --> 10:35.776
She kept laughing at me for no reason.

10:36.167 --> 10:39.944
Oh, sorry to hear that, Fred.
It's hard to find that special lady.

10:39.994 --> 10:43.948
Just ask me, the otter bachelor of Central Park.

10:43.949 --> 10:46.884
What's odder about being a bachelor?

10:47.899 --> 10:50.105
You and that sense of humor.

10:50.180 --> 10:54.051
Anyway, I'm going to play my spanish guitar now.
