WEBVTT

00:00.890 --> 00:02.198
- I'M NOT PREGNANT!
- OKAY.

00:02.240 --> 00:03.753
- I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR
FOUR MONTHS.

00:03.790 --> 00:06.099
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED
"INTRAUTERINE SCARRING.â€˜l

00:06.140 --> 00:07.061
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:07.110 --> 00:08.828
- I REALLY WANTED
TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.622
- YOU WERE UP ALL NIGHT
WRITING.

00:10.660 --> 00:14.141
- YOUR MOTHER HAS WRI'I'I'EN
A PLAY, AND IT'S FANTASTIC.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.455
- GILLIAN T. BLOUNT.
- DO YOU WANT TO BE A WRITER?

00:16.490 --> 00:18.833
- YES.
- I MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.802
- TELL ME WHY YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN GOING TO BERKELEY.

00:20.840 --> 00:21.807
- IT'S A GREAT SCHOOL.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.149
- I SPOKE TO THE DEAN
OF ADMISSIONS TODAY,

00:24.190 --> 00:26.078
AND YOU DgDHN'T GET IN.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.052
- WHAT YOU DID TO ME
MAKES ME SICK.

00:27.090 --> 00:29.320
WHAT YOU DID TO
OUR FAMILY MAKES ME SICK.

00:29.370 --> 00:31.713
- WE ARE A FAMILY,
AND I WILL DO ANYTHING

00:31.750 --> 00:34.025
TO GET YOU
TO FORGIVE ME, I SWEAR.

00:37.890 --> 00:40.825
WE MET AT A WEDDING...

00:40.860 --> 00:45.445
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT--

00:45.490 --> 00:48.414
I MEAN, I GUESS EVERYONE
GETS LUCKY AT A WEDDING.

00:48.460 --> 00:51.179
- IF I COULD WRITE OUT
MY OWN DREAM

00:51.220 --> 00:53.802
- THEN THIS
ADORABLE FIVE-YEAR-OLD

00:53.840 --> 00:55.569
SHOWS UP ON MY DOORSTEP.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.228
YOU KNOW, THIS TALL...

00:58.260 --> 01:02.708
AND BIG, HUGE EYES,
AND THIS FUNNY SMILE.

01:02.750 --> 01:03.842
SO WHEN I ASKED HER
TO MARRY ME,

01:03.890 --> 01:06.529
ALL I HAD WAS THIS
PLASTIC SPIDER RING.

01:06.580 --> 01:09.094
SO APPARENTLY,
THERE'S A RIGHT AND WRONG WAY

01:09.130 --> 01:11.644
TO LOAD A DISHWASHER.
AND THEN SHE STARTS IN WITH,

01:11.690 --> 01:13.134
"YOU DON'T EVER
WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS,"

01:13.170 --> 01:14.580
OR, "YOU'RE NOT
A TEAM PLAYER,"

01:14.620 --> 01:16.508
OR, "YOU CAN DISCIPLINE
YOUR KID"--MY KID!

01:16.550 --> 01:19.758
HER HAIR ALWAYS SMELLED
LIKE CHAMOMILE AND VANILLA

01:19.800 --> 01:21.415
FROM HER SHAMPOO.

01:21.460 --> 01:25.794
SO I BOUGHT A BOTTLE
SO I COULD SMELL HER.

01:27.290 --> 01:30.453
THIS GIRL WORKED FOR MY BROTHER
AND ALL I REMEMBER

01:30.500 --> 01:32.877
IS ORANGE JUICE
FLYING EVERYWHERE.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.876
SHE WON'T TALK TO ME,
WON'T TAKE MY CALLS,

01:34.920 --> 01:37.912
WON'T ANSWER EMAILS.
IF IT WEREN'T FOR JABBAR,

01:37.950 --> 01:40.293
I DON'T THINK
SHE WOULD EVEN...

01:40.340 --> 01:41.716
DEAL WITH ME.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.160
I JUST WANT TO
MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.883
I WANT TO GET MY FAMILY BACK,

01:44.930 --> 01:48.582
AND I WANT TO BE FORGIVEN
AND MAKE A HOME FOR US

01:48.620 --> 01:50.440
SO WE CAN ALL LIVE IN IT
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

01:52.870 --> 01:54.861
- WHAT ARE THESE?
LIKE, DOOR PRIZES OR SOMETHING?

01:54.900 --> 01:57.141
- THEY'RE STARS, AND
THEY'RE GONNA HANG AND TWINKLE.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.863
IT'S GONNA BE ROMANTIC.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.140
THE THEME
IS MIDNIGHT IN PARIS.

02:01.190 --> 02:03.499
- [French accent]
AW, BUT OF COURSE, PAREE.

02:03.530 --> 02:07.603
- YEAH.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.848
[giggIeSJ
DO YOU WANT TO GO?

02:10.880 --> 02:11.812
- GO WHERE?
PARIS?

02:11.850 --> 02:15.365
- UM...
TO PROM.

02:16.920 --> 02:17.955
- OH.

02:17.990 --> 02:21.574
- MM.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.928
- I JUST--

02:22.970 --> 02:25.928
I DON'T THINK
I'M A PROM GUY.

02:25.970 --> 02:27.790
- I THINK IT'S
GONNA BE REALLY FUN.

02:27.830 --> 02:32.449
AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
LOOK REALLY CUTE IN A TUXEDO.

02:32.490 --> 02:35.311
DOES THAT SOUND STUPID?

02:35.360 --> 02:39.319
- HADDIE, I WOULD BE HONORED
TO BE YOUR PROM DATE.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.920
- OKAY.
- MM-HMM.

02:41.950 --> 02:43.565
- GREAT.
- SO.

02:43.610 --> 02:45.566
- [giggIeSJ

02:45.610 --> 02:50.434
[phone ringing]

02:50.480 --> 02:51.924
- [laughing]

02:51.960 --> 02:53.404
YES, JULIA,
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.475
- HI.

02:54.510 --> 02:55.681
- WOW.
- I KNOW.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.891
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
THANK YOU.

02:56.930 --> 02:58.579
- YOU'RE A REALLY LOUSY
ICE SKATER.

02:58.620 --> 02:59.655
- NO, I'M A GOOD SKATER.

02:59.690 --> 03:00.918
I JUST HAD AN INCIDENT.

03:00.970 --> 03:01.994
- I'M SORRY, DOES IT HURT?
- ANYWAY.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.894
NO, IT'S FINE.
ANYWAY, OKAY.

03:03.940 --> 03:05.658
THESE ARE FOR YOU.
- OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.315
I GO THROUGH PAPER
VERY QUICKLY NOW.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.284
- GOOD, SO WHAT'S
THIS PRODUCER GUY DO?

03:09.320 --> 03:11.595
- OH, MY GOSH,
HE GIVES DEADLINES AND SUPPORT

03:11.630 --> 03:13.700
AND MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE
THE WHOLE THING IS FOR REAL.

03:13.740 --> 03:15.560
YOU KNOW?
- THAT'S GOOD.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.919
- WE'LL SEE.
SO, HOW DOES THIS WORK

03:16.950 --> 03:18.941
WITH BABY-MAKING, HMM?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.881
- [giggIeSJ
UM, so FAR IT'S BEEN FUN.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.808
[both giggling]

03:24.850 --> 03:26.545
- BUT...

03:26.580 --> 03:29.333
ACTUALLY, SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT
UP, I TALKED TO THE DOCTOR.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.644
AND IT'S GOING TO BE
DIFFICULT FOR ME

03:31.690 --> 03:32.714
TO CONCEIVE AGAIN.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.648
- THEY ALWANYg SAY THAT.

03:34.690 --> 03:36.578
IT'S REALLY
NOT IN THE CARDS.

03:36.630 --> 03:37.699
SO...
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:37.730 --> 03:38.958
EVE R?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.238
- IT'S OKAY.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.623
- OH, JULIA.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

03:42.670 --> 03:44.558
IT'S TOTALLY FINE.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.454
I WAS SAD WHEN
I FOUND OUT, OF COURSE.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.946
BUT I'M SO BLESSED.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.845
I HAVE THE MOST
AMAZING DAUGHTER

03:50.880 --> 03:52.609
AND THE MOST
AMAZING HUSBAND.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.916
AND I'M JUST GONNA
FOCUS ON THE EVERY DAY

03:55.950 --> 03:57.463
THAT I HAVE WITH THEM.
- YEAH.

03:57.510 --> 03:59.364
WELL, YES.

03:59.410 --> 04:00.889
FOCUS ON EVERY DAY,
'CAUSE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

04:00.930 --> 04:03.785
THEY ARE APPLYING TO COLLEGE
AND ALL GROWN UP.

04:03.820 --> 04:05.299
- RIGHT!
OH, MY GOD, HOW'S AMBER?

04:05.340 --> 04:07.308
- GOOD. SHE'S GOOD.

04:07.350 --> 04:08.203
OKAY, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.414
I KNOW HOW HARD
SHE WAS TAKING BERKELEY.

04:15.010 --> 04:16.693
OH...

04:23.880 --> 04:25.916
- WOW.
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

04:25.950 --> 04:28.430
I THINK JASMINE

04:28.470 --> 04:29.914
- MM-HMM.

04:29.950 --> 04:32.714
- HOW MUCH IS IT?
- THEY JUST CUT THE PRICE.

04:32.750 --> 04:33.956
THEY BOUGHT ANOTHER HOUSE

04:33.990 --> 04:36.504

05:15.620 --> 05:17.827
AND THAT MAKES THAT
"NOSTALGIA" HERE.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.420
- OH, GOD, IT'S SO HARD.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.509
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

05:24.970 --> 05:28.007

05:40.440 --> 05:42.408

HOW TO BRING IT UP WITH YOU.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.919
[sighs]

05:43.960 --> 05:45.848
- BRING WHAT UP?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.059
- I DIDN'T
GET INTO BERKELEY.

05:54.210 --> 05:56.132
- DID YOU
THINK I WOULD BE MAD?

05:56.180 --> 05:59.525
- I WAS JUST...

05:59.560 --> 06:03.109

[sighs]

06:03.150 --> 06:05.835
SAD ABOUT IT, SO I
KNEW YOU'D BE DISAPPOINTED.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.598
AND I JUST--
- I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED...

06:07.640 --> 06:10.564

I'M DISAPPOINTED FOR YOU.

FIGURE OUT WHAT'S NEXT.

06:13.990 --> 06:15.844

06:15.890 --> 06:17.539
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

06:17.580 --> 06:18.922
BECAUSE...

06:18.960 --> 06:21.758
I'M NOT READY TO MAKE A PLAN
FOR WHAT TO DO NEXT.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.781
I'M NOT READY
TO THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY.

06:23.830 --> 06:27.539
I'M FEELING VULNERABLE
AND UPSET

06:27.590 --> 06:28.750
AND SENSITIVE ABOUT IT

06:28.800 --> 06:30.756
AND I DON'T
WANT ADVICE OR IDEAS.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.892
YOU KNOW,
I JUST WANT YOU TO LISTEN.

06:31.940 --> 06:35.068
AND I JUST CAN'T
TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT

06:35.110 --> 06:36.805
THIS WAY YET, OKAY?

06:36.840 --> 06:38.876
'CAUSE I'M STILL
TOO HURT, OKAY?

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

07:45.050 --> 07:45.971
- I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS,
OKAY?

07:46.010 --> 07:48.114
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
- HONEY, IT'S PROM.

07:48.150 --> 07:49.731
EVERYBODY
WANTS TO GO TO PROM.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.113
I DIDN'T THINK ALEX WOULD
BECAUSE HE'S OLDER,

07:52.160 --> 07:53.946
BUT IT'S--
- YEAH, I WAS COUNTING ON THAT.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.184
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

07:55.230 --> 07:57.198
- HONEY,
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

07:57.230 --> 07:58.265
IT'S PROM.

A PARENT AND SCHOOL-SANCTIONED

- REALLY?

08:03.690 --> 08:05.021
- YEAH, YOU KNOW IT,
I KNOW IT,

08:05.070 --> 08:06.822
EVERYBODY WHO'S EVER BEEN
TO A PROM KNOWS IT

08:06.860 --> 08:08.066
AND I THOUGHT
WE DODGED THIS BULLET.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.306
- WELL,
WE NEED TO TRUST HER.

08:09.350 --> 08:10.203
- HONEY,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT TRUST.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.276
THIS IS ABOUT
A ROOM FULL OF TEENAGERS

08:12.310 --> 08:14.653
AND RUNAWAY HORMONES
CAUSING THEM TO LOSE CONTROL.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.009
- I KNOW.
I WENT TO PROM.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.043
- YEAH, I KNOW
YOU WENT TO THE PROM.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.324
- OH, WHAT ABOUT THIS?
THIS IS A LOVELY COLOR.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.112
DO YOU LIK|\IIEOTHIS ONE?

08:28.160 --> 08:29.604
- THAT WAS A TEST. YOU PASSED.
- THANK YOU.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.289
- DO YOU WANT TO SHOW YOUR LEG
OFF LIKE THIS?

08:31.330 --> 08:33.298
- THEY'RE ALL BAD.
- WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO WEAR?

08:33.340 --> 08:35.092
THIS IS KINDA COOL.
- YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

08:35.130 --> 08:36.984
- IT'S A LITTLE FROUFY,
ISN'T IT?

08:37.030 --> 08:38.748
- LOOK AT YOU,
FASHIONISTA.

08:38.790 --> 08:40.064
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR DRESS?
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING TO PROM?

08:40.100 --> 08:42.091
- I WOULD NOT BE
CAUGHT DEAD GOING TO PROM.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.721
BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR
ASKING.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.558
- WHY ISN'T SHE GOING?
IT'S ACTUALLY YOUR PROM.

08:46.590 --> 08:47.966
YOU'RE A SENIOR.
- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT MY...

08:48.010 --> 08:49.238
- I COULDN'T TELL YOU.
- VIBE.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.201
- COME ON.
- WE COULD ALL GO

08:50.250 --> 08:51.694
AND WATCH MATCHING SUITS.
- SHE'S SCARED.

08:51.730 --> 08:53.698
- WHAT AM I SCARED OF?
- DANCING.

08:53.740 --> 08:54.968
- AND YOU THINK
THAT'S WHY I WOULDN'T GO?

08:55.010 --> 08:56.216
BECAUSE
I'M SCARED TO DANCE?

08:56.250 --> 08:57.182
- WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO GO?

08:57.220 --> 09:00.087
- DANCING AT PROM
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY?

09:00.120 --> 09:02.042
- SHE'S SCARED THAT
WE'RE ALL GONNA REALIZE

09:02.090 --> 09:05.150
HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE DOESN'T
WANT US TO KNOW THAT SHE IS.

09:05.190 --> 09:06.361
- MM, GREAT
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.368
FLATI'ERY, I LIKE IT.
- I'M JUST SAYING.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.289
IT WOULD BE FUN TO GO...
WITH YOU.

09:11.340 --> 09:13.308
- THAT IS PRETTY
NICE OF YOU TO SAY,

09:13.340 --> 09:14.682
AND I APPRECIATE IT.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.233
BUT I JUST--
- SO YOU'LL COME?

09:16.270 --> 09:18.033
- WHAT, SO IT'LL
JUST BE THE THREE OF US?

09:18.070 --> 09:19.139
I CAN, LIKE, POP
IN BETWEEN YOU GUYS

09:19.170 --> 09:20.899
WHILE YOU'RE SLOW DANCING?
- NO, YOU BRING A DATE.

09:20.930 --> 09:22.067
- YEAH.
- BRING A DATE?

09:22.110 --> 09:24.965
LET'S SEE, WHICH ONE OF
MY ANGRY, TATTOOED FRIENDS...

09:25.010 --> 09:26.978
- OLDER, MALE FRIENDS.
- CAN I CONVINCE

09:27.010 --> 09:29.626
TO COME WITH ME TO PROM?
- I MEAN, BRANDON'S AVAILABLE.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.695
- YEAH, BRANDON!
OH, FROM COMMUNITY CENTER!

09:31.740 --> 09:34.140
- IS HE HOMELESS?
- NO, HE'S NOT HOMELESS.

09:34.190 --> 09:35.805
- HE'S GOT
CUTE BLONDE HAIR.

09:35.850 --> 09:36.919
YOU'D LIKE HIM.
HE'S FUNNY.

09:36.950 --> 09:38.019
I THINK IT'LL BE FUN.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.084
I THINK WE SHOULD
ALL GO TOGETHER

09:39.130 --> 09:42.054
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME
AND TAKE STUPID PICTURES.

09:43.340 --> 09:44.671
IT'LL BE REALLY FUN.

09:44.720 --> 09:45.982
- [whispers]
RIGHT.

09:46.030 --> 09:47.850
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT,
IS THAT OKAY?

09:47.890 --> 09:49.687
IS THAT ENOUGH?

09:49.720 --> 09:51.335
- YEAH.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.348
- THEY ONLY TOOK
THREE AMERICANS EVERY YEAR,

09:53.380 --> 09:55.132
SO IT WAS A BIG HONOR,
YOU KNOW?

09:55.180 --> 09:56.727
- IT IS.
- I'M DOING MY FIRST INTERNSHIP

09:56.760 --> 09:58.387
AT THE ROYAL
SHAKESPEARE COMPANY, OKAY...

09:58.420 --> 09:59.387
- UNBELIEVABLE.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.411
- WITH SIR PETER HALL
DOING HAMLET.

10:01.460 --> 10:04.759
AND EVERY NIGHT,
HE WOULD COME TO THE BOX OFFICE,

10:04.810 --> 10:06.732
AND HE WOULD
ASK FOR THE RECEIPTS

10:06.770 --> 10:08.089
FOR THAT NIGHT'S
PERFORMANCE.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.294
SO ONE NIGHT,
I TOOK A DEEP BREATH,

10:11.330 --> 10:14.083
LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE,
AND SAID...

10:14.130 --> 10:16.746
"WHY DON'T
YOU CUT THE SOLILOQUY?"

10:16.780 --> 10:19.340
- WHAT?
WAIT, WHAT?

10:19.370 --> 10:21.099
YOU TOLD HIM HE SHOULD CUT...

10:21.130 --> 10:22.757
both: "TO BE OR NOT TO BE."
- RIGHT.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.950
- OUT OF HAMLET?
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.069
- [laughing]

10:25.100 --> 10:26.829
- WELL, NOW THINK ABOUT IT.
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.339
IT STOPS THE ACTION OF THE PLAY.

10:28.380 --> 10:30.132
I'LL BET YOU A $1,000

10:30.180 --> 10:32.387
IT WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL
PRODUCTION,

10:32.420 --> 10:36.174
BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH THE REST OF THE STORY.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.176
AND I SAID, "TAKE IT OUT,

10:38.220 --> 10:40.666
"AND THE SCENE MOVES
LIKE A RAILROAD TRAIN.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.258
THINK ABOUT IT."
AND HE SAYS,

10:42.290 --> 10:43.461
"YOU'RE FIRED."
- [glggleSJ

10:43.500 --> 10:45.183
I BET HE DID.
- HE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

10:45.230 --> 10:48.085
AND...
BUT A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER,

10:48.130 --> 10:51.190
HE COMES DOWN
AND HE LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS,

10:51.230 --> 10:54.119
"YOU MAY BE RIGHT."
- [gasp5]

10:54.170 --> 10:58.231
- AND THAT'S THE WAY
I GOT MY FIRST DIRECTING JOB.

10:58.270 --> 11:00.067
- OH, WOW.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.852
WOW.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.174
SO WHAT? WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

11:05.210 --> 11:08.384
- BECAUSE I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO
CUT THE FIRST TWO SCENES

11:08.420 --> 11:09.899
OF THE SECOND ACT.

11:09.940 --> 11:12.044
AND YOU'RE
GONNA WANT TO FIRE ME.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.422
- YOU'RE CRAZY.
YOU'RE FIRED.

11:13.460 --> 11:16.111
NO WAY. THAT IS--THAT IS
THE WHOLE SECOND ACT.

11:16.150 --> 11:17.139
- THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT.

11:17.190 --> 11:19.283
CUT THE FIRST TWO SCENES,
READ IT,

11:19.330 --> 11:21.912
AND YOU'LL SEE EVERYTHING
YOU NEED IS IN THERE.

11:21.950 --> 11:23.121
- BUT THERE'S--YOU
DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.843
I'D HAVE TO REWS%R)K THE END OF--

11:24.890 --> 11:26.710
SO?
REWORK IT.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.365
OKAY.
WHAT IS THAT, THREE DAYS?

11:28.410 --> 11:29.718
- NO.
[scoffs]

11:29.750 --> 11:31.126
FOR YOU, MAYBE.

11:31.170 --> 11:32.307
- SARAH...

11:32.340 --> 11:35.924
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY
THAT HAS ARISEN

11:35.970 --> 11:40.725
THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU
A STAGED READING

11:40.760 --> 11:43.103
AT THE BERKELEY
TH EATER COMPANY.

11:43.150 --> 11:45.175
- NO.
- YEP.

11:45.220 --> 11:46.448
- [chuckles]
OKAY.

11:46.490 --> 11:48.936
THAT'S REALLY COOL,
BUT IT'S NOT READY.

11:48.980 --> 11:51.119
I SHOULD WAIT UNTIL
IT'S IN BETTER SHAPE.

11:51.150 --> 11:53.152
- YOU COULD DO THESE CHANGES
IN THREE DAYS.

11:53.190 --> 11:56.159
- I COULD IF I DIDN'T
HAVE A FAMILY AND A JOB.

11:56.190 --> 11:58.841
AND IT'S CLOSE, BUT--
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP

11:58.890 --> 12:00.437
BUT THINK
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

12:00.470 --> 12:02.859
IF YOU PUT ALL THAT
ENERGY YOU HAVE

12:02.890 --> 12:05.950
INTO THIS PLAY.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.820
SARAH...

12:07.860 --> 12:10.408
I HATE TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL YOU.

12:10.450 --> 12:13.510
YOU HAVE A GIFT.
YOU REALLY DO.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.893
THIS IS A GREAT PLAY.
THIS PLAY IS YOU.

12:16.940 --> 12:20.034
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE,
LET YOURSELF COME FIRST.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.088
[doorbell rings]

12:28.360 --> 12:29.770
- HEY.
- HEY.

12:29.810 --> 12:31.368
- YOUR DAD HOME?
- YEAH.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.428
- HEY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:37.480 --> 12:39.050
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?

12:39.100 --> 12:41.568
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
PROBABLY SICK OF ME SAYING IT,

12:41.620 --> 12:44.271
BUT I'M SO SORRY.

12:44.310 --> 12:46.164
AND I HATE
THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING.

12:46.210 --> 12:47.279
- OKAY.
IS THAT IT?

12:47.310 --> 12:49.517
YOU DONE?
- NO, UM...

12:49.560 --> 12:51.243
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT

12:51.280 --> 12:53.032
BUYING A HOUSE.
- GREAT.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.139
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
YOU WANT TO BORROW SOME MONEY?

12:55.180 --> 12:56.386
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.
SO YOU CAN GO.

12:56.430 --> 12:58.591
- NO, I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO BORROW MONEY.

12:58.630 --> 13:01.212
I KNOW YOU'RE PISSED
AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND,

13:01.260 --> 13:03.046
BUT YOU KNOW...

13:03.090 --> 13:04.227
NORMALLY,
YOU WOULD'VE SAID MAYBE,

13:04.260 --> 13:06.228
"THAT'S INTERESTING,
WHY NOW?

13:06.260 --> 13:08.296
YOU DON'T HAVE
A FIANCEE OR A SON ANYMORE."

13:08.330 --> 13:10.059
- MM-HMM.
- TO WHICH I WOULD REPLY,

13:10.090 --> 13:12.194
"THAT'S HOW I'M GONNA
WIN THEM BACK."

13:13.370 --> 13:15.372
- OKAY.
WELL, YOU REALLY ARE AN IDIOT.

13:15.410 --> 13:17.139
- YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA?

13:17.170 --> 13:19.058
- NO, I DON'T.
YOU'RE BEHAVING LIKE A CHILD.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.988
YOU CHEATED ON YOUR FIANCEE,
AND NOW YOU THINK THAT

13:21.040 --> 13:23.031
GOING AND BUYING A HOUSE
IS GONNA MAKE IT ALL BETTER?

13:23.070 --> 13:26.142
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY?
THAT'S YOUR PLAN?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.626
- ACTUALLY, YEAH, THAT'S
THE PLAN AS OF RIGHT NOW.

13:28.660 --> 13:30.139
- WELL, THAT'S
A STUPID PLAN, OKAY?

13:30.180 --> 13:31.112
AND IT'S
FURTHER PROOF TO ME

13:31.150 --> 13:33.038
THAT YOU ARE IMMATURE
AND IRRESPONSIBLE.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.217
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I SCREWED UP.

13:34.260 --> 13:35.079
I CHEATED ON MY FIANCEE

13:35.120 --> 13:36.564
AND I RUINED THINGS
HERE FOR YOU.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.976
- YOU SURE DID.
- AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

13:38.020 --> 13:39.328
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN EVERY SINGLE DECISION

13:39.370 --> 13:42.055
I MAKE NOW IS STUPID
OR IMMATURE, ALL RIGHT?

13:42.090 --> 13:43.193
HAVE YOU EVER NIOADE A MISTAKE?

13:43.230 --> 13:45.403
NO, I HAVEN'T, ACTUALLY.
I NEVER HAVE MADE A MISTAKE.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.123
NOT LIKE THAT,
OKAY?

13:47.170 --> 13:48.546
SO GO BUY YOUR HOUSE
AND MAKE YOUR LIFE ALL BETTER.

13:48.580 --> 13:50.548
- OKAY, I'LL BUY THE HOUSE.
- GOOD, GO BUY IT.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.956
- GREAT.
- OKAY.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.069
- FINE.
- LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.476
- YEAH.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.511
THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.250
- PERFECT.
- [glggleSJ

14:07.290 --> 14:09.178
- I WENT TO SCHOOL FOR IT.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

14:09.220 --> 14:10.972
OH, HEY THERE,
TONYA HARDING.

14:11.020 --> 14:12.351
- I'M A REALLY GOOD SKATER.
- UH-HUH.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.424
- AM I NOT
A REALLY GOOD SKATER?

14:13.470 --> 14:15.153
- NO, YOU ARE
A GOOD SKATER.

14:15.190 --> 14:16.987
YOU ONLY FELL ONCE.
- I ONLY FELL ONCE!

14:17.020 --> 14:18.669
AND IT WASN'T EVEN
A BAD FALL.

14:18.710 --> 14:20.598
IT WAS JUST
SOME FREAK ACCIDENT.

14:20.650 --> 14:22.993
I GOTTA GET CHECKED OUT
FOR OSTEOPOROSIS.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.476
HEY, DID MY DAD CALL
ABOUT MY OLD GOLF CLUBS FOR SYD?

14:25.510 --> 14:26.989
- I HAVEN'T HEARD.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.999
- WELL, SYD, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
WE ARE DOING TODAY?

14:30.040 --> 14:32.099
- TODAY'S MY PLAYDATE
WITH CHLOE.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.279
- MAYBE JUST THIS ONCE
WE CAN RESCHEDULE CHLOE,

14:34.320 --> 14:37.073
BECAUSE I HAVE
SOMETHING SO SPECIAL

14:37.110 --> 14:38.179
PLANNED FOR YOU AND ME.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.381
- WELL, I THOUGHT
WE HAD SPECIAL TIME YESTERDAY.

14:40.430 --> 14:43.456
AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT.
- RIGHT.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.661
WELL, TODAY
WE'RE GOING TO THE ZOO

14:45.710 --> 14:47.985
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
BABY KOMODO DRAGONS.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.226
- COOL!

14:49.260 --> 14:50.943
- GET YOUR BAG, LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.432
- [chuckles]

14:59.070 --> 15:00.571
- IT'S A FACT THAT THINGS
GET OUT OF CONTROL

15:00.620 --> 15:02.099
ON PROM NIGHT,
AND I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO

15:02.140 --> 15:03.960
REALLY TALK TO HER, THAT'S ALL.
- I DID TALK TO HER.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.103
WE WENT OVER THE RULES
FOR PROM NIGHT,

15:05.140 --> 15:06.653
AND HER CURFEW'S
GONNA BE AN HOUR LATER,

15:06.690 --> 15:08.271
WHICH IS TOTALLY FINE.
- HONEY--

15:08.320 --> 15:09.719
- IF SHE WANTS TO GO
TO AN AFTER-PARTY, LET HER.

15:09.770 --> 15:11.032
- "IF" SHE WANTS
TO GO TO AN AFTER-PARTY?

15:11.080 --> 15:12.035
HONEY, THAT'S BEING NAIVE.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.002
- IT'S NOT BEING NAIVE.
- IT IS BEING NAIVE.

15:14.050 --> 15:15.187
HONEY, OF COURSE SHE'S
GONNA GO TO AN AFTER-PARTY.

15:15.220 --> 15:17.632
- I LAID OUT THE RULES.
- I HAD SEX WITH MICHELLE MCCANN

15:17.670 --> 15:19.285
ON PROM NIGHT.
- I KNOW YOU DID, OKAY?

15:19.330 --> 15:20.399
- OKAY.

15:20.430 --> 15:21.226
- BUT I HATE TO POINT
IT OUT TO YOU.

15:21.260 --> 15:22.352
KIDS ARE GONNA HAVE SEX
NO MATTER

15:22.400 --> 15:23.219
IF IT'S PROM NIGHT OR NOT.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.057
- NO, NO, NO, HONEY.
- YES, THEY ARE.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.159
- IT'S DIFFERENT. NO, IT'S NOT.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.428
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER
ABOUT MY PROM NIGHT?

15:27.470 --> 15:29.051
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.362
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

15:30.410 --> 15:32.059
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HER DRESS LOOKED LIKE.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.499
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT COLOR IT WAS.

15:33.550 --> 15:35.199
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HER PARENTS LOOKED LIKE.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.162
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHERE I PUT THE CORSAGE.

15:37.210 --> 15:39.098
- OH, MY GOD, OKAY.
- HONEY, I WAS LIKE A ZOMBIE

15:39.140 --> 15:40.300
WITH ONE DIRECT IVE--

15:40.350 --> 15:41.965
TO GET
MICHELLE MCCANN'S DRESS OFF.

15:42.010 --> 15:44.149
- GREAT.
- I DO REMEMBER ONE THING.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.624
SHE HAD A DRESS
WITH A SLIT UP TO HERE.

15:45.660 --> 15:46.763
- I KNOW, I REMEMBER.
- UP TO HERE, HONEY.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.903
- I SAW THE PICTURES, I KNOW.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.521
- I'M DOWN ON MY KNEES,
TAKING OFF HER GARTER BELT.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.970
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS
RIGHT NOW.

15:51.010 --> 15:52.045
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.661
STOP.
- I WANT TO MAKE A POINT.

15:53.710 --> 15:55.086
I WANT YOU TO
REALLY TALK TO OUR DAUGHTER.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.348
- HADDIE
IS NOT MICHELLE MCCANN,

15:56.400 --> 15:58.186
AND I WILL TALK TO HER.

15:58.230 --> 16:01.984
- THANK YOU.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.406
[footsteps approaching]

16:03.440 --> 16:04.532
- HEY.
- HI.

16:04.580 --> 16:06.059
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

16:06.100 --> 16:07.988
- AH.
I WOULD LOVE TO

16:08.030 --> 16:09.713
BUT I'M WORKING,

16:09.760 --> 16:13.230
AND I'VE BEEN INSTRUCTED
TO PUT MYSELF FIRST.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.726
- OKAY, COULD YOU
PUT YOURSELF FIRST

16:15.760 --> 16:17.728
IN, LIKE, TWO MINUTES
AFTER WE TALK?

16:17.760 --> 16:21.002
I TRIED TO TALK TO ADAM,
BUT HE HATES MY GUTS.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.416
- SORRY, CROS.

16:22.460 --> 16:24.735
YOU DID SLEEP WITH
HIS CHILD'S BEHAVIORAL AIDE.

16:24.770 --> 16:26.761
- YEAH, IT SOUNDS SO SCANDALOUS
THE WAY YOU SAY IT.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.118
- NO, I KNOW.
IT'S DEFINITELY

16:28.150 --> 16:30.084
THE WAY IT SOUNDS
THAT WAS SCAN DALOUS

16:30.120 --> 16:31.257
'CAUSE DOING IT,
NO BIG DEAL.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.814
- SARAH, I'M NOT DENYING
WHAT A JERK I AM.

16:33.850 --> 16:36.398
I TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.091
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
YOU'D LIKE ME TO SAY.

16:39.130 --> 16:42.122
- I'M SORRY.
IT JUST PISSES ME OFF.

16:42.170 --> 16:45.025
- WELL, I--

16:45.070 --> 16:47.061
I CAME OVER BECAUSE

16:47.100 --> 16:48.203
I'M GONNA
SELL THE HOUSEBOAT,

16:48.240 --> 16:50.720
AND I'M GONNA USE THAT MONEY
TO PUT A DOWN PAYMENT

16:50.760 --> 16:52.762
ON A HOUSE
IN HOPES THAT

16:52.800 --> 16:55.075
JASMINE WILL WANT TO
COME LIVE IN IT WITH ME.

16:55.110 --> 16:56.759
- WHAT?

16:56.800 --> 16:59.803
YOU'RE GONNA BUY A HOUSE
SHE'S NEVER SEEN

16:59.840 --> 17:01.660
TO TRY TO WIN HER BACK?
- LOOK, I DON'T--

17:01.710 --> 17:03.086
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO.

17:03.120 --> 17:03.939
I WOULD DO ANYTHING.

17:03.980 --> 17:05.629
IF I THOUGHT
SHE WANTED AN AIRPLANE,

17:05.670 --> 17:07.490
I WOULD FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET HER AN AIRPLANE.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.747
SO I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU COULD COME BY

17:09.780 --> 17:12.089
AND GIVE ME, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
A FEMALE'S PERSPECTIVE

17:12.130 --> 17:14.678
ON WHETHER SHE'LL THINK
IT'S CUTE OR NICE,

17:14.720 --> 17:16.688
AND YOU KNOW,
IF SHE WOULD LIKE IT.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.859
- I'VE NEVER BOUGHT A HOUSE,

17:18.890 --> 17:20.778
BUT I AM A FEMALE.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.821
SO YES, I CAN DO THAT.

17:22.860 --> 17:24.487
- THANK YOU.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.067
- I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'LL WORK, BUT IT'S--

17:26.110 --> 17:28.203
IT'S A GRAND GESTURE.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.286
- IT'LL BE GREAT TOO
IF MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

17:30.320 --> 17:32.481
JULIA AND JOEL--
- YEAH, AND ADAM.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.389
- I DON'T THINK
ADAM'S EVER GONNA COME OVER.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.220
- WELL, I'LL BE THERE.

17:50.620 --> 17:53.509
- HEY, HONEY, I THINK WE SHOULD
TRY ON THE GREEN ONE FIRST.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.778
- I'M TRYING
ON THE PURPLE ONE.

17:54.830 --> 17:56.548
- FOUND A LITTLE BLUE ONE
THAT MIGHT WORK.

17:56.590 --> 17:58.581
- OKAY.
- IT'S A LOT SHORTER,

17:58.620 --> 18:00.247
BUT IT'S STILL
KINDA CUTE AND FLIRTY.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.202
IT'S A LITTLE SHORT,
THOUGH.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.798
HEY, HONEY, DID YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT YOUR PLANS

18:04.840 --> 18:06.728
FOR AFTER PROM?

18:06.770 --> 18:08.522
- NO, I SAID
I WOULD CALL YOU, RIGHT?

18:08.570 --> 18:10.117
- I KNOW, BUT I JUST--
I NEED TO KNOW

18:10.150 --> 18:11.526
IF ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS
ARE GETTING HOTEL ROOMS,

18:11.570 --> 18:13.117
SO I KNOW WHERE TO
PICK YOU UP.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.730
- MOM, NO,
THEY'RE NOT, OKAY?

18:14.780 --> 18:16.771
- [gasp5]

18:16.810 --> 18:18.459
HONEY, YOU LOOK STUNNING.

18:18.510 --> 18:19.909
- NO.
- IT IS SO PRETTY.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.359
- I LOOK LIKE--
- I DIDN'T THINK THE PURPLE

18:21.410 --> 18:22.786
WOULD WORK,
BUT IT WORKS WITH THE JEWELS,

18:22.820 --> 18:24.469
AND IT'S LIKE
A YOUNG ELIZABETH TAYLOR.

18:24.510 --> 18:25.818
- NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

18:25.860 --> 18:29.091
- ARE YOU AND ALEX
TALKING ABOUT SEX?

18:30.210 --> 18:31.370
I JUST HAD TO ASK.

18:31.420 --> 18:33.559
- NO, MOM.

18:33.590 --> 18:34.796
- OKAY.

18:34.830 --> 18:36.889
OKAY, I JUST WONDERED.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.864

18:39.910 --> 18:41.241
- I AGREE.
HONEY, AS A MOM, I JUST

18:41.290 --> 18:42.837
HAVE TO ASK THESE

18:46.260 --> 18:49.491
I MEAN, I'M NOT KIDDING.
YOU LOOK STUNNING.

18:49.540 --> 18:50.700

19:16.430 --> 19:19.354
- MEDIOCRE PIZZA

19:19.390 --> 19:21.460
- OOH, CHINESE, 'CAUSE
IT'S THE TONGUE TWISTER.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.637
- [chuckles]

19:22.670 --> 19:23.944
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

19:23.990 --> 19:26.458

19:37.480 --> 19:39.721
- YOU'RE KIDDING!
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.967
I CAN EXPLAIN,
SO IF YOU'LL HOLD

19:42.000 --> 19:44.275
YOUR HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER
UNTIL THE END.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.891
HADDIE AND HER BOYFRIEND ARE,
LIKE, BEGGING ME TO GO,

19:46.940 --> 19:50.626
AND SO I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO GO.

19:50.670 --> 19:52.945
AND YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.
- WHO IS YOUR DATE?

19:52.980 --> 19:54.971
- I DON'T KNOW.
SOME GUY THAT ALEX KNOWS

19:55.020 --> 19:56.840
FROM THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.871
- YOU'RE GOING TO PROM
ON A BLIND DATE!

19:58.920 --> 20:01.741
IT'S, LIKE, 1954.

20:09.890 --> 20:13.235
BUT IT'S A STORY
YOU'LL ALWAYS TELL.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.659
IT'S AN EXPERIENCE
YOU WON'T BE SORRY YOU HAD

20:16.690 --> 20:17.964
NO MATTER
IF IT'S GOOD OR BAD.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.834
AND IT'S JUST
A BEAUTIFUL, SENTIMENTAL WAY

20:21.870 --> 20:22.859
TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO HIGH SCHOOL

20:22.910 --> 20:24.662

20:52.560 --> 20:54.824
AND I'D KEEP THE MUSIC DOWN,

20:54.870 --> 20:56.906

I'M A PERSON WHO'S A MOM

21:52.650 --> 21:53.992
WHO'S TRYING

22:16.050 --> 22:17.802
I'M KILLING MYSELF

22:17.850 --> 22:19.363
I'VE NEVER WORKED SO HARD.

DID YOU TALK TO CROSBY,
BY THE WAY?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.876

34:38.380 --> 34:39.790
- WAS EVERYTHING
OKAY WITH THE DATE?

34:39.830 --> 34:42.105
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

34:42.140 --> 34:45.143
IT WAS FINE.
IT'S JUST...

34:45.180 --> 34:47.455
THIS WHOLE...

34:47.490 --> 34:49.458
THIS WHOLE THING
IS NOT WORKING.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.799
LIKE...
YOU KNOW,

34:52.840 --> 34:55.775
GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL
AND BEING A GREAT STUDENT

34:55.810 --> 34:58.438
AND GOING TO PROM
AND HAVING A NICE DATE

34:58.470 --> 34:59.323
AND GOING TO COLLEGE.

34:59.370 --> 35:01.292
LIKE, THAT'S JUST NOT
WORKING FOR ME.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.568
- OH, HONEY,
YOU'RE SO SMART.

35:02.610 --> 35:04.817
IT'S GONNA LOOK
DIFFERENT TOMORROW, YOU KNOW?

35:04.860 --> 35:06.782
IT'S JUST GONNA FEEL--
- MOM, CAN YOU JUST LISTEN!

35:06.820 --> 35:09.687
REALLY LISTEN TO WHAT
I'M SAYING, PLEASE!

35:09.720 --> 35:13.133
I AM TRYING TO COMMUNICATE
WITH YOU HONESTLY HERE, OKAY?

35:13.180 --> 35:17.412
I DID THE BEST I COULD
TO DO WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.452
I DID THE BEST THAT
I COULD TO BE GOOD IN SCHOOL,

35:20.490 --> 35:24.597
TO GO TO COLLEGE AND TAKE
PART IN THIS HIGH SCHOOL LIFE.

35:24.630 --> 35:26.279
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING
FOR ME.

35:26.330 --> 35:28.469
SO I'M SORRY,
BUT I NEED TO START DOING

35:28.500 --> 35:31.537
WHAT FEELS GOOD FOR ME
AND TRYING TO SEE IF THAT WORKS.

35:31.570 --> 35:33.299
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE THING

35:33.330 --> 35:34.911
OF DOING WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO DO

35:34.960 --> 35:36.404
AND WHAT YOU SUGGEST ME TO DO

35:36.440 --> 35:37.668
AND YOU TRYING
TO FIX MY PROBLEMS,

35:37.720 --> 35:38.880
IT'S NOT WORKING.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.854
IT'S NOT YOUR LIFE.
IT'S MY LIFE.

35:40.890 --> 35:42.687
AND I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THAT I'M GONNA START

35:42.720 --> 35:45.405
MAKING MY OWN DECISIONS,
WHETHER YOU LIKE THEM OR NOT.

35:45.450 --> 35:46.678
AND THAT HAS
TO BE OKAY WITH YOU,

35:46.730 --> 35:49.176
BECAUSE IT'S WHO I AM.

35:49.210 --> 35:50.620
OKAY?

36:10.440 --> 36:13.853
- ALEX.
- YES?

36:13.890 --> 36:16.927
- REMEMBER WHEN
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT,

36:16.960 --> 36:20.373
LIKE, TIME?

36:20.410 --> 36:23.516
- YEAH?
- AND, LIKE, UM...

36:23.560 --> 36:28.623
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, THEN--
THAT WE'LL KNOW.

36:28.660 --> 36:31.424
- YEAH?

36:31.460 --> 36:37.945
- I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW
IS THE RIGHT TIME.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.845
- HADDIE, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO FEEL PRESSURE

36:39.880 --> 36:41.495
JUST BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, IT'S PROM NIGHT

36:41.540 --> 36:43.326
AND YOUR FRIENDS GOT ROOMS.

36:43.370 --> 36:44.337
- NO, I DON'T.

36:44.370 --> 36:47.225
I FEEL--I FEEL LIKE
THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME.

36:47.270 --> 36:50.922
I FEEL GOOD.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.645
- I FEEL GOOD.
- OKAY.

36:53.690 --> 36:56.682
- MM-HMM.

37:19.990 --> 37:21.878
- HONEY, I'M REALLY
STARTING TO WORRY.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.547
- WHY?
- BECAUSE SHE--

37:23.580 --> 37:25.377
LOOK, IT'S FOUR MINUTES
UNTIL CURFEW.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.549
- SHE HAS FOUR MINUTES.
- I'M GONNA GIVE HER A CALL.

37:27.590 --> 37:28.545
JUST GONNA MAKE SURE SHE'S--
- HONEY.

37:28.590 --> 37:30.034
- WHAT?
- STOP PANICKING.

37:30.070 --> 37:31.685
- I'M NOT PANICKING.
- YOU ARE PANICKING.

37:31.730 --> 37:33.652
- I'M NOT.
- YES, YOU ARE.

37:33.690 --> 37:35.487
[door opens]

37:35.520 --> 37:37.693
- AH.

37:37.730 --> 37:40.733
- SEE?

37:46.710 --> 37:48.940
HEY.

37:48.990 --> 37:50.366
- HEY.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.709

37:52.750 --> 37:53.842
- YEAH.

37:53.890 --> 37:56.029
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

37:56.060 --> 37:58.711
JENNA WAS PROM QUEEN

37:58.750 --> 38:01.617
AND THE DECORATIONS
LOOKED REALLY NICE, SO...

38:02.690 --> 38:04.544
YEAH, I'M GONNA GO TO BED.
- GREAT.

38:04.590 --> 38:06.376
- I'M TIRED.
- OKAY.

38:06.420 --> 38:07.626
- YOU CAN SLEEP IN
TOMORROW IF YOU WANT.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.458
- HEY, THANK YOU
FOR MAKING CURFEW.

38:10.490 --> 38:12.936
- UM...THANKS FOR
THE DRESS.

38:12.980 --> 38:15.426
both: YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:21.980 --> 38:23.390
- FEEL BETTER?

38:23.430 --> 38:24.636
- YES.
YES, I DO.

38:26.780 --> 38:29.749
SHE'S A GOOD GIRL.
- YES, SHE IS.

38:55.540 --> 38:58.498
- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH...

38:58.540 --> 39:02.579
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO PLAY GOLF WITH YOU.

39:02.610 --> 39:03.838
- [sighs]

39:03.890 --> 39:07.576
- SOMEONE

39:07.620 --> 39:09.576
- [crying]

39:09.620 --> 39:13.545
- REACHING FOR ME NOW

39:13.590 --> 39:16.821
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

39:18.520 --> 39:24.664
- THROUGH THE DARK

39:24.700 --> 39:27.703
REACHING FOR ME NOW

39:34.440 --> 39:37.466
YOU NEED

39:37.510 --> 39:39.717
SOMEONE

39:39.750 --> 39:43.470
TO HEAR YOU WHEN YOU SIGH

39:43.510 --> 39:44.829
[door closes]

39:49.620 --> 39:53.454
SOMEONE

39:53.490 --> 39:58.666
TO WIPE AWAY THOSE TEARS
YOU CRY

40:04.850 --> 40:07.080
- WOW, SOMEBODY
REALLY LIKED CATS.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.747
- MOLDY, EVEN.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.668
CLEARLY, THE WINDOWS
HAVE TO COME OUT.

40:10.710 --> 40:11.813
- YEAH.

40:11.850 --> 40:13.477
- THAT'S NOT TOO HARD,
THOUGH, IS IT?

40:13.510 --> 40:15.671
- NO, I MEAN,
IT'S NOT TOO HARD,

40:15.720 --> 40:18.883
BUT WHEN YOU ADD THAT
TO THE KITCHEN CABINETS

40:18.930 --> 40:22.058
AND THE TILES AND
THE AROMA OF ALLEGED HOMICIDE,

40:22.100 --> 40:24.068
IT'S NOT NOTHING, MAN.
- ALL RIGHT.

40:24.110 --> 40:25.247
- CROS,
HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT

40:25.280 --> 40:27.032
THIS LITTLE HOUSE
ACROSS THE STREET?

40:27.070 --> 40:28.651
IT'S REALLY CUTE.
- YEAH.

40:28.700 --> 40:30.691
OBVIOUSLY, IF I COULD
AFFORD THE PERFECT HOUSE

40:30.730 --> 40:32.459
ACROSS THE STREET,
I WOULD'VE GOT THAT ONE.

40:32.490 --> 40:34.697
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

40:34.740 --> 40:36.708
- CROS, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS SAYING AT ALL.

40:36.740 --> 40:39.629
THIS IS A REALLY SWEET IDEA.
- SUCH A NICE IDEA.

40:39.670 --> 40:40.944
- IT'S JUST
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY

40:40.990 --> 40:42.946
AND A LOT
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

40:42.990 --> 40:45.015
- WELL, I ALREADY
BOUGHT THIS HOUSE, SO...

40:48.580 --> 40:51.549
- THIS ONE?

40:51.580 --> 40:53.024
- OH.

40:53.070 --> 40:55.709
OH, MY GOD.

40:55.760 --> 40:59.992
OH, MY GOD, I DO NOT
KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.508
I MEAN, ACTUALLY I DO.
I WAS THINKING,

41:02.560 --> 41:04.039
"YOU KNOW,
I ALREADY WRECKED MY LIFE,

41:04.080 --> 41:06.002
"SO I DON'T REALLY CARE
IF I WRECK IT WORSE

41:06.040 --> 41:09.589
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY
WRECK IT WORSE THAN TOTALLY."

41:09.630 --> 41:11.598
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- THERE'S CONTINGENCIES HERE.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.210
- YEAH, THE INSPECTION
MIGHT NOT GO THROUGH.

41:13.260 --> 41:14.113
- NOT A CHANCE.
- YEAH.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.492
YOU CAN WIGGLE
OUT OF IT DURING ESCROW.

41:16.540 --> 41:19.703
- YEAH, WELL, I ALREADY
SOLD THE HOUSE BOAT.

41:21.680 --> 41:22.886
- HE DID.

41:22.920 --> 41:24.615
- WOW.

41:24.650 --> 41:28.711
- IT SEEMED LIKE A GROWN-UP
THING TO DO AT THE TIME.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.853
- WELL, IT WAS.

41:30.900 --> 41:32.856
I MEAN, WHAT KIND
OF A GROWN-UP GUY

41:32.900 --> 41:36.791
LIVES ON A HOUSE BOAT?

41:36.830 --> 41:39.833
- THANKS FOR COMING.

41:41.630 --> 41:44.144
- I MEAN, NOT THAT
THIS PLACE ISN'T A DUMP.

41:44.190 --> 41:45.839
- AWFUL.
- [chuckles]

41:45.880 --> 41:49.043
- [laughing]

41:49.090 --> 41:50.876
YOU THINK I CAN FIX IT?

41:52.880 --> 41:55.189
- NO.
- OKAY. GREAT.

41:55.230 --> 41:58.222
- I THINK WE CAN FIX IT.

42:05.790 --> 42:07.542
- SORRY.

42:09.690 --> 42:10.827
- YEAH, YEAH.

42:10.870 --> 42:12.076
- I BOUGHT A BAD HOUSE.

42:12.110 --> 42:14.908
[indistinct chatter]
