I thought I wrote you back.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.915
Oh, maybe it got stuck
in my outbox.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.417
It happens.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.502
Ah, yep.
It did.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.670
- Okay.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.297
- Here.
Just sent it!

- I--I did.
- Great.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.650
- Hey, so what did
you guys think

10:51.734 --> 10:53.152
of your first day
of classes?

10:53.235 --> 10:54.653
Like, was it easier
than you expected,

10:54.737 --> 10:56.739
or harder,
or, like, way harder?

10:56.822 --> 10:57.823
- Easier.
- Easy.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.450
- Easier, not harder?

10:59.533 --> 11:01.243
both: Easier.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.079
I thought this place
was supposed to be hard,

11:03.162 --> 11:05.664
but my public school education
definitely prepared me for it,

11:05.748 --> 11:06.916
definitely.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.584
Like, I'm gonna go
do my homework,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.461
and I'll probably be done in,
like, four seconds.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.755
But, you know, you've
just got to laugh, right?

11:12.838 --> 11:14.924
Like, it's just--it's funny.

- Hmm?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.598
Oh, I wasn't really listening.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.901
- Uh, Miss Murray,
can I talk to you

11:33.984 --> 11:35.611
about yesterday's
assessment test?

11:35.694 --> 11:37.154
- Before you say anything,
you should know

11:37.238 --> 11:39.615
that my father did pay
for this building.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.409
- Okay. Uh, noted.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.160
What I was going to say
is that you got

11:43.244 --> 11:46.247
the highest score
in the class.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.623
- Wait, really?

11:47.706 --> 11:49.417
I did the best?
- Yeah.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.503
- Wow. I mean, I would have
thought everyone did well.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.463
It was so stupid and easy.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.340
- Mm, okay. Well,
that's kind of insulting.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.802
Regardless, you need to be
in a much higher-level class.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.263
Also, I want to increase
the number of women

12:02.346 --> 12:03.639

I just thought college would be

I mean, two weeks ago,

13:45.950 --> 13:49.703
I was in Ohio, and tonight
I'm going to a naked party.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.413
Not many of those in Akron.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.625
- I'm sorry, what?
- Oh, Akron is a city in Ohio.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.086

the detail that I want!

It's looking so good!

is contouring my body.

enhance my banging bod.

These are

I bought gently used on eBay.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.526

doing this?

14:20.609 --> 14:23.571
- Because I'm going
to a naked party!

- Huh?
- To a what?

- No, no, no. It's not an orgy!

to this party?

Bela!

Kimberly, it's just us two.

if not hundreds of years.

on our couch?

why aren't there four?

- No, I'm--[scoffs]

I'm sorry. How is that
any of your business?

16:20.729 --> 16:22.606

I'm just surprised.

- Did I upset you?
- Uh, no.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.826
No, it's just you have no idea
what you are talking about.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.121
When did you come out?
- In high school.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.498
- So for someone like you,
I'm sure coming out

16:39.581 --> 16:41.041
probably made you
more interesting,

16:41.125 --> 16:42.793
but, for me,
I was popular,

16:42.876 --> 16:44.670
so I actually
have something to lose.

to come out, but it's worth it.

- Well...

20:20.761 --> 20:23.805
- Same time?
- Same time.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.486
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.904
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

20:38.987 --> 20:42.074
[laughter]

20:44.242 --> 20:46.411
- No, he went down the way!
- He went down the whole way.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.704
- Holy--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.498
Guys, stop.
Hey, Leighton.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.458
- Oh, hey.
- What's up?

20:51.541 --> 20:54.336
Are you, like, alone?
- Yeah.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.422
- But it's a Friday night.
- Yeah, I know it's Friday.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.174
Maybe I'm going
somewhere really fun.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.843
- Are you?
- No.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.137
- Look, Leight,
just because those girls

21:04.221 --> 21:07.099
don't want to live with you
doesn't make you a loser.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.434
- Yo, what they did
was not cool.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.145
- You told them?
- Well, yeah. Of course I did.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.897
I mean, that was
really fucked up.

21:13.981 --> 21:18.026
- Yeah, for what it's worth,
we all felt so bad for you.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.320
- Okay.
Well, this was horrible,

21:20.404 --> 21:22.656
and I am, uh,
I'm going to go drink

21:22.739 --> 21:24.741
until I forget this
conversation ever happened.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.201
- Leighton, Leighton.

21:26.284 --> 21:27.995
You're gonna make friends soon.
I know it.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.247
- Everything you're saying
is making it worse. Thank you.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.457
- Damn, she must be
really hurting.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.292
Want to go
throw knives at trees?

21:34.376 --> 21:35.377
- Yep.
- Let's fucking go.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.379
- Let's go!

you realize it,

21:47.806 --> 21:50.934
but you're aggressively
cupping your breasts in shame.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.895
- Yes. You're right.
I am doing that.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.733
I'm fixing it now.
Here we go.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.484
Ah!

21:59.568 --> 22:01.278
- I'm proud of you.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.405
Ready to mingle?
- Yeah.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.532
Which group of butts
looks more approachable:

22:05.615 --> 22:07.409
the right or the left?

22:07.492 --> 22:09.077
- The right butts look kinder,

22:09.161 --> 22:10.620
but I don't know
what I'm basing that on.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.748
- Yeah, no, I agree.
Right butts, for sure.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.624
- Uh-huh.
- Let's go.

22:16.334 --> 22:18.128
- Hey, Emma is on the lit mag?

22:18.211 --> 22:20.714
- Hello, everybody!

22:20.797 --> 22:23.884
- So embarrassing that we all
wore the same outfit, right?

22:23.967 --> 22:25.427
- Is this
your first naked party?

22:25.510 --> 22:27.929
- No.
Why would you say that?

22:28.013 --> 22:31.016
- Because you looked down at
everyone's junk multiple times.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.602
- Naked parties are about
being comfortable in your skin,

22:33.685 --> 22:35.187
not objectifying
and catching a peek.

22:35.270 --> 22:38.440
- Oh, no doubt. No doubt.
I know that.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.400
I just looked down again,
didn't I?

22:40.484 --> 22:41.651
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.073
- So we're not even
supposed to look?

22:46.156 --> 22:48.617
What is this, a naked party
under Taliban rule?

22:48.700 --> 22:51.620
- Why are you two hanging out
alone like a bunch of creeps?

22:51.703 --> 22:53.163
People think you're cops.

22:53.246 --> 22:54.915
- [gasps]
- Maybe we should just go.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.084
I thought this would be the
amazing, unforgettable party

22:57.167 --> 23:00.796
I've been waiting for, but
that's obviously not the case.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.631
- No, we are gonna stay,

23:02.714 --> 23:04.674
and we are gonna
make the most of it together.

23:04.758 --> 23:07.135
Jocelyn, you seem
so comfortable.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.595
How can we be more like you?

23:08.678 --> 23:11.640
- I pregamed a lot,
so I'm crazy drunk.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.892
- Okay.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.659
- Okay. Well, there's
a gift receipt in the basket.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.619
You have 14 days.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.164
Are you okay?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.041
- My fucking boyfriend
just broke up with me.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.292
- Okay.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.294
- He can't handle
our soccer schedule.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.964
He says I'm never around,
like my life should revolve

23:44.047 --> 23:45.632
around hanging out
in his frat basement

23:45.715 --> 23:47.759
while he and his friends
flick each other in the nuts.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.302
- Sounds like a real winner.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.721
- You don't fucking know him.
His dog just died.

23:51.805 --> 23:54.224
- I should not have said that.

23:54.307 --> 23:57.561
- It's okay.
He does suck.

23:57.644 --> 24:01.189
It's just, not like guys
are lining up for me, so--

24:01.273 --> 24:03.275
- Jena, what?
You're so pretty.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.985
- Oh, fuck you.
- You are!

24:05.068 --> 24:06.319
You're tall,
you're ripped,

24:06.403 --> 24:08.488
and you're, like,
so good at soccer.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.490
That's why it kills me
that you don't like me.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.868
So, look, if this guy
doesn't get that, fuck him.

24:12.951 --> 24:17.038
Move on. There's
plenty of guys out there.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.749
- Thanks.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.376
- So are we good now?

24:21.459 --> 24:23.587
'Cause I'd love it
if you stopped kicking the shit

24:23.670 --> 24:25.547
out of me on the field.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.883
- Yeah, we're good.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.551
But you're wrong
about one thing:

24:29.634 --> 24:30.886
There aren't many guys our age

24:30.969 --> 24:32.679
who can handle
being with girls like us,

24:32.762 --> 24:35.223
so good luck finding one.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.105
- I mean, come on.
It's a naked party!

24:42.189 --> 24:43.565
Everybody looks at everybody.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.984
You just can't look
like you're looking.

24:46.067 --> 24:49.196
Like, right now, I just glanced
at your boobs three times.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.281
- No, you did not!
You were looking at my eyes.

24:51.364 --> 24:54.576
- I micro-glanced.
The left one is bigger.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.787
- Holy hell, she's right.
Your left one is bigger.

24:57.871 --> 25:01.917
- Hey, do any of you know
where a girl named Sarah is?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.585
- No.
- Sorry.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.670
- I don't.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.714
- Did you see that?
- Wow!

25:07.797 --> 25:08.965
- Micro-glance!

25:09.049 --> 25:10.592
[laughter]

25:10.675 --> 25:12.385
- I'm gonna get a drink.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.935
- What the hell?!

25:20.018 --> 25:23.438
Ugh, of course it's you.
- You know what? No.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.941
- You spilled my drink.
- And I'm sorry about that,

25:26.024 --> 25:27.442
but I already know
where this is going.

25:27.525 --> 25:28.818
You're gonna
say something mean to me

25:28.902 --> 25:30.237
and make me feel bad
about myself.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.613
I'm a good person!

25:31.696 --> 25:33.990
Did I jerk
your boyfriend's dick? I did!

25:34.074 --> 25:35.450
But if I knew
he had a girlfriend,

25:35.533 --> 25:36.952
I wouldn't have done it.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.787
Please stop being mean to me.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.206
I'm sorry!

25:41.289 --> 25:42.582
- Come over here.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.630
I know I've been...
less than kind.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.925
It's because I fought super
hard for you in the first cut.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.468
Staff was split
about your submission,

25:53.551 --> 25:55.178
and people preferred this guy,

25:55.262 --> 25:58.556
but I thought your stuff was
funny, so I pushed for you,

25:58.640 --> 26:00.141
which then made me
look like an idiot

26:00.225 --> 26:02.018
when everyone found out
that the girl I supported

26:02.102 --> 26:04.604
had a jack-fest with my boyf
the night before.

26:04.688 --> 26:05.981
- You liked my submission?

26:06.064 --> 26:08.358
- It was pretty solid.
- Pretty solid?

26:08.441 --> 26:10.568
- You're a first-year.
Take it easy.

26:10.652 --> 26:14.197
- So, wait, can we just
please be good now?

26:14.281 --> 26:16.199
I don't want you to hate me.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.867
- Yeah, we can be good.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.912
- I think I need to hug you.
- Oh!

26:23.581 --> 26:25.625
- Oh, jeez, my abs
rubbed off on you.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.669
- Mm, my boob contour
got on you too.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.671
- Ah! We both contoured?!

26:29.754 --> 26:31.464
I love us!

26:40.307 --> 26:42.684
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.062
- This will be quick.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.648
- Oh, shit.
You're wasted.

26:48.732 --> 26:52.402
- Nico, at the naked party,
I had an epiphany.

26:52.485 --> 26:57.324
You are going
to French tutor me...

26:57.407 --> 26:58.992
in French, please.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.745
- You're asking me to tutor you
at 1:00 in the morning?

27:01.828 --> 27:02.912
- Mm-hmm.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.748
- [chuckles]

27:04.831 --> 27:06.875
Sure, I'll tutor you.

27:06.958 --> 27:11.171
- Oh, excellent,
and I appreciate.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.548
Good night.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.717
- That's it?
- That'll be all, Tutor.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.053
Thank you!

27:18.136 --> 27:19.512
- What?

27:29.105 --> 27:31.566
- Hello, John.
Your hat looks stupid,

27:31.649 --> 27:34.569
and the school
you founded sucks.

27:34.652 --> 27:37.906

you died in the snow.

- Who?

27:43.244 --> 27:45.580
- You had my nipples in
your mouth in a minivan today?

27:45.663 --> 27:47.165
- What do you want?

27:47.248 --> 27:49.334
Look, did you not sufficiently
lecture me in your car?

27:49.417 --> 27:51.086
- I'm just calling
to check in on you.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.921
I could tell you're
in a really bad place

27:53.004 --> 27:54.672

27:54.756 --> 27:56.383
it gets better.

"It Gets Better-ing" me?

28:00.595 --> 28:02.013
Yeah, no, I am fine.
