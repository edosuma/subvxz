00:18.706 --> 00:21.766
Come back onto this leg. Weight on this leg.

00:23.010 --> 00:25.945
Pull your weight back onto this....
Off that leg.

00:26.347 --> 00:29.145
Onto this leg. Weight back, there you go.

00:30.017 --> 00:32.247
Okay, just take with your arm.

00:32.453 --> 00:35.616
You wanna slide forward...

00:36.290 --> 00:38.315
and reach with your arm.

00:40.161 --> 00:42.686
And slide back, step back.

00:42.763 --> 00:45.630
-Arnold, do it behind me.
-Reach back with your arm.

00:46.167 --> 00:47.998
And forward.

00:49.236 --> 00:53.002
I'll do this twice, and then I'll come
and look at you and correct you.

00:53.341 --> 00:56.538
And back. Now what you want is mobility.

00:56.611 --> 01:01.310
So you want a pass-through position
that will keep showing the body, right?

01:01.382 --> 01:03.282
-So where are your arms?
-Like this.

01:03.351 --> 01:05.751
Start, I would think, with the focus up.

01:05.820 --> 01:07.788
-Looking up?
-Looking up.

01:07.855 --> 01:10.756
That would help.... That'll make a nice....

01:10.825 --> 01:13.157
lf your eye line goes up there....

01:13.227 --> 01:14.694
-Right.
-Yeah.

01:16.931 --> 01:18.489
That's the idea.

01:18.566 --> 01:21.729
What you have to realize....
Okay, take it a little bit slower.

01:21.802 --> 01:25.670
What you have to realize
is that people are watching you all the time.

01:25.740 --> 01:28.300
They're not just watching
you there and there.

01:28.376 --> 01:29.707
Keep it up.

01:31.946 --> 01:33.709
And....

05:31.385 --> 05:34.047
<i>Gold's Gym, Venice, California...</i>

05:34.455 --> 05:38.357
<i>Where many of the best bodybuilders
in the World come to train.</i>

05:40.861 --> 05:42.453
Jesus Christ!

05:45.566 --> 05:47.295
-That's a sick guy.
-You're back.

05:47.368 --> 05:49.563
-How are you doing?
-All right.

05:49.637 --> 05:51.036
-Big Mac.
-How are you?

05:51.105 --> 05:53.198
-All right.
-Good.

05:53.507 --> 05:55.304
-How you doing?
-You remember Joey?

05:55.376 --> 05:56.707
How you doing?

05:57.344 --> 05:59.812
-Paul.
-I thought you'd forgotten all about me.

05:59.880 --> 06:03.179
I thought you liked me as well.
Thought you'd forgotten all about me.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.810
-I'm sorry.
-No, you're the greatest.

06:08.088 --> 06:10.488
Big Tony, how you doing?

06:10.557 --> 06:12.650
-This is for me?
-Yeah.

06:12.726 --> 06:16.025
-Kenny.
-How you been? Just got back?

06:16.096 --> 06:19.998
Can I sign up here?
I want to start gaining some muscles.

07:02.596 --> 07:03.824
Come on.

07:49.676 --> 07:51.303
Pumped up, you know.

07:52.345 --> 07:55.007
<i>Arnold Schwarzenegger, 28 years old...</i>

07:55.081 --> 07:57.879
<i>6'2'', 240 pounds.</i>

07:58.284 --> 08:00.809
<i>Mr. Olympia for the past five years.</i>

08:00.920 --> 08:04.321
<i>He is preparing to defend his title
this year for the last time.</i>

08:04.524 --> 08:08.085
All Mr. Universes
from the past five years or so...

08:08.161 --> 08:12.996
get together in one contest to find out
who is the best of all the Mr. Universes.

08:13.066 --> 08:16.502
So they created the Mr. Olympia contest,
which is then the top contest.

08:16.569 --> 08:19.094
And whoever wins that
is the top bodybuilder.

08:19.172 --> 08:21.231
-And you are the top bodybuilder.
-Right.

08:21.307 --> 08:23.241
How long have you been the top?

08:23.309 --> 08:26.574
I've not been beaten for the last seven years.

08:27.113 --> 08:28.273
And...

08:28.648 --> 08:31.674
I won the Mr. Olympia contest
five years now.

08:31.751 --> 08:33.342
This is now the sixth year.

08:33.419 --> 08:35.683
-They score on points?
-Yeah, on points.

08:35.755 --> 08:40.317
lt's like judging the body
by muscularity, and by proportion...

08:40.493 --> 08:42.518
symmetry, the whole thing.

08:42.828 --> 08:45.354
Do you visualize yourself
as a piece of sculpture?

08:45.432 --> 08:47.059
Yeah, definitely.

08:47.867 --> 08:51.234
Good bodybuilders have the same mind...

08:51.304 --> 08:53.829
when it comes to sculpting,
than a sculptor has.

08:53.907 --> 08:56.842
lf you analyze it,
you look in the mirror and you say:

08:56.910 --> 09:01.313
''I need more deltoids, more shoulders,''
so you get the proportions right.

09:01.381 --> 09:03.576
So what you do is you exercise...

09:03.650 --> 09:05.743
and put those deltoids on.

09:05.819 --> 09:09.812
Whereas an artist
would just slap on some clay on each side.

09:09.889 --> 09:12.824
Does it, maybe, the easier way.
We go through a harder way...

09:12.892 --> 09:15.360
because you have to do it on a human body.

09:15.428 --> 09:17.794
I mean, obviously a lot
of people look at you...

09:17.864 --> 09:20.765
and they think it's kind of strange,
what you're doing.

09:20.834 --> 09:23.894
But those are the people
who don't know much about it.

09:23.970 --> 09:26.734
As soon as you find out
what the whole thing is about...

09:26.806 --> 09:28.637
then it's just like another thing.

09:28.708 --> 09:32.542
lt's not any stranger as going into a car...

09:32.612 --> 09:36.070
and trying to go in a quarter mile,
five seconds.

09:36.182 --> 09:37.843
I mean, that's, for me, strange.

10:03.276 --> 10:05.540
<i>The greatest feeling you can get in a gym...</i>

10:05.612 --> 10:09.708
<i>or the most satisfying feeling
you can get in a gym, is the pump.</i>

10:10.450 --> 10:12.577
<i>Let's say you train your biceps.</i>

10:12.652 --> 10:16.383
<i>Blood is rushing into your muscles,
and that's what we call the pump.</i>

10:16.456 --> 10:18.788
<i>Your muscles get a really tight feeling...</i>

10:18.858 --> 10:21.452
<i>like your skin is going to explode
any minute.</i>

10:21.528 --> 10:24.861
<i>It's really tight, it's like somebody
blowing air into your muscle.</i>

10:24.931 --> 10:28.867
<i>It just blows up and it feels different.
It feels fantastic.</i>

10:35.975 --> 10:38.842
<i>It's as satisfying to me as coming is.</i>

10:38.912 --> 10:41.881
<i>As having sex with a woman and coming.</i>

10:43.082 --> 10:45.346
<i>So can you believe
how much I'm in heaven?</i>

10:45.752 --> 10:50.018
I'm getting the feeling of coming in the gym.
I'm getting the feeling of coming at home.

10:50.089 --> 10:53.058
I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage
when I pump up...

10:53.126 --> 10:56.562
when I pose out in front of 5,000 people,
I get the same feeling.

10:56.629 --> 11:00.190
I'm coming day and night.
I mean it's terrific, right?

11:01.167 --> 11:03.294
So, you know, I'm in heaven.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.412
All right, got to do that.

11:17.750 --> 11:21.777
This girl maybe didn't have a kiss for years.
I may as well give her a break.

11:22.188 --> 11:24.418
<i>Terminal Island, California...</i>

11:24.624 --> 11:27.058
<i>a federal prison for men and women.</i>

11:29.362 --> 11:31.023
I wanna get me a kiss.

11:43.376 --> 11:45.776
I heard about those guys in here.

11:47.747 --> 11:49.840
Yeah, we got a few of them.

11:50.650 --> 11:53.551
Come over here and I'll give you your kiss.

12:06.833 --> 12:08.664
Yes, I got this pose.

12:08.735 --> 12:11.033
He's got a beautiful body, man.

12:11.971 --> 12:15.372
First time I ever seen
somebody's arms 23 inches.

12:17.010 --> 12:19.240
He's a big dude, all the way big dude.

12:26.185 --> 12:30.588
<i>I started reading about gaining weight
and weightlifting in some magazines.</i>

12:30.657 --> 12:32.955
<i>And I saw Arnold's picture.</i>

12:33.159 --> 12:35.923
<i>And when I saw him from all those angles...</i>

12:35.995 --> 12:38.793
<i>every angle those shots were taken from,
he looked good.</i>

12:38.865 --> 12:41.595
<i>And I said, ''That's the way I wanna look. ''</i>

12:41.968 --> 12:44.493
My father's real tall and I'm short,
so at least...

12:44.570 --> 12:47.556
if I can't get as talI as he is,
I wanna be as wide as he was.

12:47.556 --> 12:48.386
if I can't get as talI as he is,
I wanna be as wide as he was.

12:48.624 --> 12:51.718
Make one line. Try to make one line straight.

12:51.793 --> 12:54.626
So you always remember
that you have to have a line.

12:54.997 --> 12:57.090
Yeah, see now there's your line.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.791
And look where you point.

13:00.969 --> 13:02.061
Yeah.

13:03.438 --> 13:04.598
Great.

13:07.175 --> 13:09.541
<i>I like what you had in Ironman.</i>

13:14.082 --> 13:16.277
Yeah, that's good.

13:17.019 --> 13:19.613
Again, raise up the hand.

13:21.256 --> 13:23.281
Remember one thing, when you pose...

13:23.358 --> 13:26.088
a lot of little guys have one habit.

13:26.161 --> 13:28.152
And they hide away when they pose.

13:28.230 --> 13:31.222
When they do an arm pose, they do like this.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.928
The big guy will come right out
with his arm.

13:34.002 --> 13:37.938
Never do that, never hide away.
Like right now, you did like this.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.632
You know, show them.
Show them the whole thing.

13:41.743 --> 13:44.371
Make the move, open up the whole body.

13:46.148 --> 13:47.877
Do the same thing again.

13:47.949 --> 13:49.348
Yeah, great.

13:50.152 --> 13:51.949
Look confident, yeah.

13:52.354 --> 13:53.378
Good.

14:42.070 --> 14:43.537
Yeah, do it!

15:01.857 --> 15:03.757
Just pose slowly, good.

15:04.259 --> 15:05.749
They'll go nuts.

15:05.827 --> 15:08.159
Crowd's good tonight. ls it?

15:10.932 --> 15:13.059
Close that arm more. Good.

15:15.103 --> 15:16.331
<i>Mike Katz.</i>

15:16.405 --> 15:20.034
<i>31 years old, 6'1'', 240 pounds.</i>

15:20.275 --> 15:22.937
<i>One of the top amateur bodybuilders
in the world.</i>

15:26.481 --> 15:30.611
<i>Mike lives in North Branford, Connecticut,
and is a junior high school teacher.</i>

15:31.319 --> 15:33.879
Show them the back,
turn around for the back.

15:34.623 --> 15:35.954
Good girl.

15:36.391 --> 15:39.292
How about a ''most muscular''
in the front, like this, Michelle?

15:39.361 --> 15:40.919
Like this, hands down.

15:40.996 --> 15:43.658
Michael, show her the most muscular.
Good girl.

15:46.201 --> 15:47.691
That's a girl.

15:47.769 --> 15:49.896
-Can you do that?
-I can do that one, dad.

15:49.971 --> 15:52.769
All right, you do that one.
Go ahead, one arm.

15:52.841 --> 15:55.071
That's a boy, it's hard.

15:55.143 --> 15:57.634
Feel this muscle, how hard that is, Michelle.

15:57.712 --> 15:59.270
Feel up here, right here.

15:59.781 --> 16:01.772
lsn't that hard? Yeah.

16:01.850 --> 16:03.545
-Feel mine.
-Feel yours?

16:03.618 --> 16:06.610
She wants you to feel yours,
don't jump on me now. Come on.

16:06.688 --> 16:08.053
Feel yours.

16:08.190 --> 16:10.954
-Nothing, no muscle.
-Nothing? How about daddy's?

16:14.930 --> 16:17.023
-Daddy got a big muscle?
-Yeah.

16:17.098 --> 16:20.158
Come on, Mike, ripped,
come on get up, come on.

16:20.702 --> 16:21.930
Come on.

16:24.539 --> 16:25.631
Good.

16:28.009 --> 16:29.101
Get up.

16:29.678 --> 16:30.736
Up.

16:31.513 --> 16:32.673
Come on, up.

16:35.150 --> 16:38.051
<i>I can remember back in my life...</i>

16:38.119 --> 16:42.283
<i>When I would be picked on quite often.
I'm sure every kid's gone through it.</i>

16:42.357 --> 16:46.293
<i>But it just affected me more than,
I think, it would affect other people.</i>

16:47.429 --> 16:49.522
<i>''Hey, four eyes, hey, cross-eyes. ''</i>

16:49.865 --> 16:52.629
<i>''You got rusty fenders on your bicycle. ''</i>

16:52.701 --> 16:54.828
<i>''Your bike isn't as good as our bike. ''</i>

16:54.903 --> 16:56.268
<i>''Hey, Jew boy. ''</i>

16:56.338 --> 16:59.273
<i>Or, ''You're not Catholic,
so you're no good. ''</i>

17:00.742 --> 17:04.371
<i>I can remember times
when kids would be going to dances...</i>

17:04.445 --> 17:07.711
<i>and I would leave a dance,
like, 11:00 at night.</i>

17:07.781 --> 17:11.273
<i>I'd leave a dance for no reason
and say, ''I'll show them. ''</i>

17:11.353 --> 17:14.720
<i>And go and run on a track
for two or three hours.</i>

17:14.789 --> 17:16.915
<i>Or go home and lift weights.</i>

17:17.925 --> 17:21.919
<i>I got involved in all the peewee sports
most kids play, hockey and so forth.</i>

17:21.997 --> 17:23.828
<i>Then when I got into high school...</i>

17:23.898 --> 17:26.527
<i>and I made all-state
and all-American in football.</i>

17:28.870 --> 17:32.397
<i>I was doing very well with the Jets
until I got injured.</i>

17:33.842 --> 17:37.278
<i>That was my biggest thing, to go
on a football field and be so feared.</i>

17:37.345 --> 17:41.145
<i>I wanted to be put in a cage
and rolled out, like in a circus.</i>

17:41.650 --> 17:45.711
<i>Big bars with chains and everything.
And then just hope like hell...</i>

17:45.787 --> 17:48.813
<i>that everybody would run off the field
when they saw me coming.</i>

17:48.890 --> 17:51.620
<i>Let's give him a big welcome, Mike Katz.</i>

18:19.054 --> 18:21.750
<i>In every contest I ever won...</i>

18:22.557 --> 18:24.957
<i>or ever lost, I always got
the most applause...</i>

18:25.026 --> 18:27.551
<i>and the people were most for me.</i>

18:31.566 --> 18:35.229
<i>When I went to the Mr. Universe
contest in '72...</i>

18:35.303 --> 18:38.033
<i>and in '73 and in '7 4...</i>

18:38.106 --> 18:40.802
<i>I knew, even though
I didn't win the contest...</i>

18:40.875 --> 18:44.538
<i>When I go to South Africa this year,
I'm sure the same thing is gonna happen.</i>

18:44.613 --> 18:46.274
<i>The crowd is gonna be for me.</i>

19:00.462 --> 19:03.397
<i>The contests in South Africa, in Pretoria...</i>

19:03.598 --> 19:08.297
are the most important or prestigious
amateur contests in the world...

19:08.370 --> 19:10.804
the lFBB Mr. Universe contest...

19:10.872 --> 19:13.739
which is amateur, open to amateur athletes.

19:13.808 --> 19:16.402
Sort of along the guidelines
of the Olympics.

19:16.478 --> 19:18.946
And the other contest
is a professional contest...

19:19.014 --> 19:22.780
open to professionals,
because there's money prizes involved...

19:22.851 --> 19:24.751
and that's called the Mr. Olympia.

19:24.819 --> 19:28.778
So I'll be competing in the Mr. Universe,
since I am an amateur.

19:29.057 --> 19:30.217
And...

19:30.525 --> 19:34.552
as I see it, from all of the people
who I know who are gonna be there...

19:34.629 --> 19:36.654
and the best in the world will be there...

19:36.731 --> 19:40.633
I feeI it's gonna be between
me and Ken Waller...

19:40.869 --> 19:43.064
for the overall championship.

19:45.907 --> 19:48.501
I told you boys, I'm the quarterback.

19:56.886 --> 20:01.220
I don't worry about Mike Katz, anyway.
The only one guy I worry about is Robbie.

20:03.293 --> 20:05.488
He's good, but he lacks too many things.

20:05.695 --> 20:08.163
His arms aren't big enough
to match his chest.

20:08.231 --> 20:10.392
His thighs are too big for his calves.

20:11.134 --> 20:12.533
He hits one pose.

20:12.802 --> 20:14.793
ln that, he looks like a big spider.

20:14.904 --> 20:18.772
What I'm gonna do when I get to Africa?
I'm gonna take Katz's shirt and hide it.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.606
I'm gonna take everything I can find
of his and hide it.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.475
Mess his mind up a little bit.

20:34.257 --> 20:37.249
<i>Gonna be according to countries
in alphabetical order.</i>

20:40.663 --> 20:41.994
<i>Australia.</i>

20:44.033 --> 20:47.434
We need Australia.
Will you get your clan together, please?

20:47.604 --> 20:50.038
Baghdad, Bahamas.

20:50.507 --> 20:53.533
Tall man calls Mike Katz, USA.

20:53.643 --> 20:57.374
I don't think there's much doubt.
Mike? All right.

21:52.969 --> 21:54.561
<i>Ken Waller, USA.</i>

22:03.313 --> 22:06.077
You didn't see a blue T-shirt around?

22:10.153 --> 22:13.179
Paul, you see a blue T-shirt
around with my crusher?

22:14.057 --> 22:15.490
-Waller had it.
-He had it?

22:15.558 --> 22:17.048
-Yeah.
-Where did he put it?

22:17.126 --> 22:19.390
I don't know where he put it, Mike.

22:39.983 --> 22:43.510
<i>Number 89,
from the United States of America...</i>

22:45.855 --> 22:47.220
<i>Mike Katz.</i>

23:10.346 --> 23:13.338
<i>It took me five years to win Mr. Connecticut.</i>

23:13.917 --> 23:16.715
<i>It took me four years to win Mr. America.</i>

23:16.953 --> 23:20.912
<i>This is my fifth year
that I've been trying to win Mr. Universe.</i>

23:21.524 --> 23:23.185
<i>I'm not a quitter.</i>

23:23.593 --> 23:28.223
<i>It's like a dog. You can kick a dog so long
and it will do two things.</i>

23:28.298 --> 23:30.926
<i>It's either gonna roll over and die...</i>

23:31.267 --> 23:33.895
<i>or it's gonna bite you and attack you.</i>

23:34.037 --> 23:38.337
<i>And I'm the kind of person who's
the type of a dog who would bite back.</i>

23:38.541 --> 23:40.736
<i>I wasn't gonna roll over and quit.</i>

23:55.191 --> 23:59.059
19, 16, 1 7, 16, 1 7.

24:00.897 --> 24:02.057
85.

24:02.665 --> 24:07.193
<i>Next one, 18, 18, 17, 18, 18.</i>

24:07.303 --> 24:10.670
<i>-83.
-83? That can't be right.</i>

24:17.246 --> 24:18.873
<i>It's a nine, yes.</i>

24:21.651 --> 24:25.382
<i>17, 13, 16, 14, 1 1.</i>

24:27.290 --> 24:28.655
<i>That's a four.</i>

24:28.992 --> 24:32.428
<i>Yes, 13, 16, 14, 1 1.</i>

24:33.029 --> 24:34.690
<i>-Total.
-62.</i>

24:51.381 --> 24:53.872
<i>Will the folloWing gentlemen step forward?</i>

24:53.950 --> 24:57.386
<i>They are the three finalists,
not necessarily in order.</i>

24:57.787 --> 24:59.379
<i>Ken Waller, USA.</i>

25:06.796 --> 25:08.457
<i>Paul Grant, Wales.</i>

25:15.004 --> 25:16.972
<i>Roger Walker, Australia.</i>

25:24.447 --> 25:26.244
<i>And for your information...</i>

25:26.315 --> 25:29.614
<i>the fourth-place winner
was in fact Mike Katz.</i>

25:36.559 --> 25:38.857
<i>Can you believe the tension
with these fellas?</i>

25:38.928 --> 25:41.362
<i>It's bad enough for you,
how must it be for them?</i>

25:41.431 --> 25:44.332
<i>So far, they made it, they made the big one.</i>

25:44.667 --> 25:46.567
<i>They won the 1975...</i>

25:47.136 --> 25:48.797
<i>IFBB Mr. Universe.</i>

25:58.147 --> 26:01.344
I wonder what time it is back
in the States, do you know?

26:01.417 --> 26:03.385
I've gotta call my wife.

26:05.688 --> 26:07.588
-lt's about 5:00.
-Good.

26:08.558 --> 26:11.584
The kids ought to be playing,
driving her crazy.

26:14.163 --> 26:16.757
<i>Third place in the tall man category...</i>

26:16.833 --> 26:19.301
<i>IFBB, Mr. Universe...</i>

26:22.405 --> 26:24.305
<i>from Wales, Paul Grant.</i>

26:33.583 --> 26:35.175
<i>Second place...</i>

26:38.955 --> 26:41.549
<i>from Australia, Roger Walker.</i>

26:47.497 --> 26:50.557
<i>And the winner of the 1975
tall man category...</i>

26:50.767 --> 26:53.759
<i>from the United States of America,
Ken Waller.</i>

26:55.838 --> 26:57.897
Kenny won. Great.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.137
Terrific.

27:00.443 --> 27:01.967
How about that?

27:02.178 --> 27:04.043
Boy, that's fantastic.

27:06.783 --> 27:08.114
Fantastic.

27:11.187 --> 27:13.485
I can imagine how he must feel.

27:13.856 --> 27:15.221
lncredible.

27:16.392 --> 27:20.021
Probably like I did when I was 16
and won my first trophy.

27:20.730 --> 27:23.597
ln its own way,
it's probably just as satisfying.

27:25.101 --> 27:28.366
I gotta go shake his hand,
that's fantastic, great.

27:29.806 --> 27:31.535
And get my T-shirt.

27:36.579 --> 27:39.980
<i>Suffice to say the other two gentlemen won
their height categories...</i>

27:40.049 --> 27:41.311
<i>made the finals...</i>

27:41.384 --> 27:44.376
<i>and our overall winner for 1975,
Ken Waller...</i>

27:44.453 --> 27:46.444
<i>United States of America.</i>

28:12.381 --> 28:15.214
-Want another pose?
-Yeah, just keep going.

28:22.558 --> 28:24.278
Wait a second.

28:41.395 --> 28:44.592
<i>My parents in the beginning,
when I started bodybuilding...</i>

28:44.665 --> 28:47.065
<i>they didn't know really what it is...</i>

28:47.134 --> 28:49.659
<i>until I introduced my father
to bodybuilding...</i>

28:49.737 --> 28:51.671
<i>and I took him to all the gymnasiums.</i>

28:51.739 --> 28:56.403
<i>And he then started picking up weights,
and making his arms strong and so on.</i>

28:56.543 --> 28:59.535
And then they started liking what I did.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.810
Especially after I won
the first international competition...

29:02.883 --> 29:05.078
<i>Which was the first contest I ever entered...</i>

29:05.152 --> 29:08.178
<i>the Junior Mr. Europe in Stuttgart, Germany.</i>

29:08.722 --> 29:12.715
<i>So when I came home with my trophy,
my parents were very proud of me...</i>

29:12.793 --> 29:16.229
<i>and they said, ''My son, that's my son. ''</i>

29:17.297 --> 29:20.960
<i>My father was a police chief in Austria...</i>

29:21.035 --> 29:23.026
<i>in a town called Graz.</i>

29:24.104 --> 29:28.370
<i>We had a very strict upbringing
because of him being With the police force.</i>

29:28.442 --> 29:30.433
<i>We had to be the perfect example.</i>

29:30.511 --> 29:32.536
<i>We couldn't do anything bad.</i>

29:32.613 --> 29:35.912
<i>And it was kind of an uptight
feeling at home because of it.</i>

29:38.752 --> 29:42.552
<i>I always felt like my place is America.
And when I was 10 years old...</i>

29:42.623 --> 29:45.888
<i>I only dreamed of coming
to America and being the greatest.</i>

29:45.959 --> 29:49.258
<i>And just being different
than everybody else.</i>

30:08.182 --> 30:10.707
I never experienced anything like it.

30:10.784 --> 30:13.275
-Open your legs wide, Arnold.
-Open my--

30:13.353 --> 30:15.321
Get a little more power.

30:15.656 --> 30:18.716
-Open your legs a little more.
-Little bit to the right.

30:18.792 --> 30:21.158
Don't strain looking up at him.

30:21.228 --> 30:24.220
Just put your face, just hug him,
kind of sexy.

30:25.766 --> 30:27.529
Crush it, Arnold.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.597
Bend the exerciser.

30:34.808 --> 30:36.935
I thought you were strong.

30:37.010 --> 30:39.604
Put your legs behind his back a bit,
could you?

30:39.680 --> 30:41.443
Play with his hair a little.

30:41.515 --> 30:43.540
Sandy, why don't you get down lower...

30:43.617 --> 30:46.142
so that your head is down
closer to the floor.

30:46.220 --> 30:48.051
That's it, right.

30:48.122 --> 30:50.056
Okay, here we go.

30:51.525 --> 30:52.890
Good, hold.

30:53.861 --> 30:56.659
-You drink skim milk, don't you?
-No, I drink no milk.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.221
-You don't drink any milk at all?
-No milk.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.762
Milk is for babies.

31:01.835 --> 31:04.303
When you grow up, you have to drink beer.

31:06.006 --> 31:09.271
<i>I was always dreaming about
very powerful people.</i>

31:10.010 --> 31:12.308
<i>Dictators and things like that.</i>

31:12.779 --> 31:15.976
<i>I was just always impressed
by people who could...</i>

31:16.283 --> 31:18.808
<i>be remembered for hundreds of years.</i>

31:20.120 --> 31:23.521
<i>Even like Jesus,
being for thousands of years remembered.</i>

32:04.131 --> 32:06.622
-I dreamt about Arnold last night.
-Really?

32:06.700 --> 32:09.828
I told him, ''Arnold, you're making
a big mistake going to Africa.''

32:09.903 --> 32:12.269
He says,
''Why do you say that, Mr. Ferrigno?''

32:12.339 --> 32:15.672
I said, ''Louie is waiting for you,
in the shadows.''

32:25.919 --> 32:30.185
<i>Lou Ferrigno, 24 years old,
a former sheet metaI worker.</i>

32:30.891 --> 32:33.189
<i>Mr. America, and twice Mr. Universe.</i>

32:33.327 --> 32:37.525
<i>He's turned professional this year,
and is a contender for the Mr. Olympia title.</i>

32:38.932 --> 32:41.765
<i>Lou lives with his parents
in Brooklyn, New York.</i>

32:54.081 --> 32:57.016
<i>At 6'5'' and 275 pounds...</i>

32:57.417 --> 32:59.578
<i>Lou is the largest bodybuilder ever.</i>

32:59.653 --> 33:02.884
<i>And he thinks he can take the title
from Arnold this year.</i>

33:03.056 --> 33:04.785
<i>So does his father, Matty...</i>

33:04.858 --> 33:09.124
<i>Who retired from the New York City Police
Department to oversee Lou's training.</i>

33:10.764 --> 33:14.757
<i>The first time Arnold came to America,
I took Louie backstage.</i>

33:14.835 --> 33:17.235
<i>And when Arnold went by us,
I'll never forget...</i>

33:17.304 --> 33:21.263
<i>I looked at Louie's face,
and he just looked at Arnold with awe.</i>

33:21.341 --> 33:23.400
<i>I thought God just passed us.</i>

33:23.477 --> 33:26.708
<i>And I looked at Louie, I said,
''What do you think, Louie?''</i>

33:26.913 --> 33:29.905
<i>And he looked at me,
he said, ''Gee, Dad, he's big. ''</i>

33:30.884 --> 33:35.253
<i>And I would say that from that moment on
when he first saw Arnold...</i>

33:35.756 --> 33:37.883
<i>he wanted to be Mr. Olympia.</i>

33:38.325 --> 33:42.159
<i>It was in his eye, in his heart,
and in his mind.</i>

33:42.229 --> 33:44.493
<i>And it became part of his entire body.</i>

33:44.564 --> 33:45.690
Okay.

33:46.433 --> 33:49.231
-Right, let me complete a full rep.
-Okay.

33:51.305 --> 33:52.465
-One.
-Right.

33:52.539 --> 33:53.471
-Two.
-Right.

33:53.540 --> 33:54.564
Up!

34:00.914 --> 34:02.245
Five.

34:02.783 --> 34:04.148
Six.

34:04.384 --> 34:05.681
Seven.

34:05.752 --> 34:06.912
Eight.

34:06.987 --> 34:08.284
Nine.

34:10.556 --> 34:12.286
-Okay, Dad.
-Okay, come on.

34:12.359 --> 34:14.156
Up, come on.

34:14.226 --> 34:16.252
Make it harder. All right.

34:16.330 --> 34:17.797
Come on.

34:19.466 --> 34:20.864
All the way.

34:20.967 --> 34:22.297
All right.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.938
-That was easy.
-Easy?

34:39.052 --> 34:40.417
You do one.

34:41.987 --> 34:46.288
<i>Louie was only an infant in the crib,
and he developed this ear infection.</i>

34:46.726 --> 34:48.888
<i>We didn't knoW it at the time...</i>

34:49.029 --> 34:53.022
<i>until Louie was about three years old,
we found out that he was hard of hearing.</i>

34:53.400 --> 34:55.868
<i>That's why he never took
an interest in things...</i>

34:55.936 --> 34:58.564
<i>other kids would take an interest in,
like television.</i>

34:58.638 --> 35:01.334
<i>He was late
learning to speak and everything.</i>

35:01.408 --> 35:03.740
<i>Louie would become a lip reader.</i>

35:06.380 --> 35:07.938
<i>Louie was a real skinny kid.</i>

35:08.014 --> 35:11.313
<i>He couldn't make the football team
because he was too skinny.</i>

35:11.385 --> 35:13.615
<i>Then he started to buy Muscle Magazine.</i>

35:13.787 --> 35:15.982
<i>I remember I would take him
to a bookstore...</i>

35:16.056 --> 35:18.524
<i>and he would buy up all
the old muscle books.</i>

35:18.592 --> 35:21.152
<i>And he would read for hours. I remember...</i>

35:21.228 --> 35:24.061
<i>2.:00, 3.:00 in the morning,
I would find his light on...</i>

35:24.131 --> 35:26.429
<i>and he would be reading the muscle books.</i>

35:27.300 --> 35:29.928
<i>So Louie decided
to do a little bodybuilding.</i>

35:30.003 --> 35:34.030
<i>I had an old weightlifting set in the cellar.
I used to do a little bit of it myself.</i>

35:34.107 --> 35:36.735
<i>Never knowing at that time that someday...</i>

35:36.810 --> 35:41.440
<i>Louie would be on the stage against Arnold,
in Pretoria, South Africa.</i>

35:45.585 --> 35:47.018
You just keep after him.

35:47.087 --> 35:50.215
Wherever he goes,
you pose down with him, right next to him.

35:50.290 --> 35:53.589
Let the judges make a comparison.
You're 6'5''.

35:53.660 --> 35:58.393
You'll be the biggest thing that ever went
out on that platform, at 275 pounds.

35:58.565 --> 36:02.194
They know that, and he knows it.
This is for the big baby, Louie.

36:02.335 --> 36:05.532
This is for all the marbles.
And we're gonna go after it, right?

36:05.605 --> 36:10.338
One year of training, all wrapped up
in one night, Louie, remember that.

36:10.544 --> 36:12.205
When you step out there, boy...

36:12.279 --> 36:15.612
remember all those grueling nights
and mornings in the gym.

36:15.682 --> 36:18.549
And this is it, this is the reward.
And we want it.

36:18.618 --> 36:20.882
We want it so bad that we can taste it.

36:20.954 --> 36:23.013
Remember that when we're on that stage.

36:23.089 --> 36:26.820
We gotta get so excited, when we're there
we have only one thought in mind.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.520
That's the Olympia, we'll win.

36:51.798 --> 36:55.256
-How long is Arnold sleeping?
-He's been here for a couple days now.

36:55.335 --> 36:56.927
Yeah, a couple days?

36:57.003 --> 36:59.198
The reason why I woke you up
was because...

36:59.272 --> 37:02.503
I am gonna go to New York tonight.
I did wanna say goodbye.

37:02.576 --> 37:04.942
And I'm gonna see Ferrigno there.

37:05.011 --> 37:08.640
We're gonna train for two, three weeks.
And everything...

37:10.083 --> 37:11.675
that I learned from you...

37:11.751 --> 37:14.652
that you stole from me, I'm gonna give him.

37:14.855 --> 37:18.791
I figure the combination's gonna be
very hard to beat, Arnold, very hard.

37:19.526 --> 37:21.824
I'll see you when you get back.

37:23.497 --> 37:26.330
What should I tell Louie
when I get to New York?

37:26.399 --> 37:29.266
I mean, I am gonna train with him
for a few days.

37:29.336 --> 37:31.167
TelI Louie...

37:32.038 --> 37:33.903
-that I said hi.
-Yeah?

37:34.508 --> 37:36.908
Say to his father that I said hi.

37:37.744 --> 37:41.180
And I'm looking forward
to seeing him in South Africa.

37:43.283 --> 37:44.910
-Okay?
-AlI right.

37:44.985 --> 37:47.180
ln other words, you want me to be very nice.

37:47.254 --> 37:48.846
-Be very nice to him.
-Okay.

37:48.922 --> 37:51.220
Because he needs a lot of help.

37:51.758 --> 37:54.659
-See, the king of the hilI can only go down.
-That's right.

37:54.728 --> 37:57.219
-The king of the hilI can only go down.
-Or stay up.

37:57.297 --> 37:59.527
-Or stay on that hill.
-Right.

37:59.766 --> 38:01.631
That's the other possibility.

38:02.536 --> 38:04.936
But the wolf on the hill--

38:05.005 --> 38:06.996
The wolf on the hill, right...

38:07.073 --> 38:10.372
is not as hungry
as the wolf climbing the hill.

38:10.544 --> 38:14.571
That's true, he's not as hungry.
But when he wants the food, it's there.

38:19.653 --> 38:22.486
Biceps, the back, trapezius another thing.

38:23.123 --> 38:27.423
Also, in fact, this evening I'm gonna jog
about a mile and a half, two miles.

38:28.328 --> 38:30.421
I think that's a good idea.

38:35.035 --> 38:38.266
-You think we need more weight, Hank?
-Couple more pounds.

38:38.338 --> 38:40.772
AlI right, good.

38:43.143 --> 38:45.270
Here, we got 10 right here.

38:51.985 --> 38:54.579
Come on, let's do 10 good reps, Lou.

38:55.088 --> 38:56.988
10 good reps, come on.

39:01.928 --> 39:03.953
-Come on, Lou.
-Come on, Louie.

39:04.030 --> 39:05.258
Come on!

39:07.167 --> 39:09.567
-No more.
-Come on, more!

39:10.904 --> 39:12.064
Good boy. Come on.

39:12.138 --> 39:14.606
-AlI right, good boy.
-That's the boy, Lou.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.243
Not enough.

39:24.351 --> 39:26.342
One more, same weight, Hank?

39:26.419 --> 39:29.388
-I'm not satisfied. I'lI put more weight.
-Let's go.

39:29.456 --> 39:31.083
I wanna beat him!

39:32.025 --> 39:33.151
I need 10 pounds.

39:33.226 --> 39:34.921
-10 pounds on each side?
-Yeah.

39:37.597 --> 39:39.690
-How many, Hank?
-Come on, I wanna see ten.

39:39.766 --> 39:42.098
-Ten!
-You're gonna do them, too.

39:43.536 --> 39:45.731
-You're gonna wipe 'em out!
-I'lI do it.

39:48.074 --> 39:50.872
Come on, Lou, push. Drive 'em up.

39:51.244 --> 39:52.768
That's it, man.

39:53.179 --> 39:55.306
You're gonna do it, come on.

39:56.349 --> 39:58.078
Arnold!

40:00.353 --> 40:01.411
Six.

40:02.088 --> 40:04.454
Seven. Goddamn, eight.

40:04.658 --> 40:06.592
Come on, nine.

40:06.726 --> 40:09.786
Suppose you get laid last night.
Keep going, ten. Come on.

40:10.530 --> 40:12.657
Force them out, there's eleven.

40:13.466 --> 40:14.899
Come on, Arnold.

40:14.968 --> 40:16.060
Five.

40:16.736 --> 40:17.760
Six.

40:18.605 --> 40:20.232
Seven. Come on now. One.

40:21.341 --> 40:22.899
Yeah. Two.

40:24.711 --> 40:26.178
Three. Come on.

40:26.713 --> 40:27.805
Four.

40:29.149 --> 40:30.741
-Five.
-Harder!

40:35.689 --> 40:39.853
-Come on, you can do it now.
-I can't concentrate with girls pushing.

40:43.029 --> 40:44.121
Push.

40:44.664 --> 40:46.894
AlI right, that's it, no more.

40:47.100 --> 40:49.193
-Here's a present.
-What, are you crazy?

40:49.269 --> 40:51.032
-Here, come on.
-God.

40:53.907 --> 40:55.932
Make those arms grow, man.

40:56.476 --> 40:58.569
Stick them out, stick it out, Louie.

40:58.645 --> 41:00.374
Come on, get it up.

41:00.613 --> 41:02.205
You do the work.

41:02.582 --> 41:03.810
Come on!

41:17.063 --> 41:18.553
Okay, take it.

41:19.199 --> 41:20.564
Oh, my God.

41:21.601 --> 41:23.592
-Good boy.
-Nice training.

41:23.703 --> 41:24.965
Good boy.

41:26.773 --> 41:28.673
Boy, what a workout.

41:29.943 --> 41:31.308
Too hot.

41:32.445 --> 41:34.936
-How do you feel, Lou?
-Pretty good.

41:35.582 --> 41:37.743
Don't ever feeI sorry for yourself.

41:37.817 --> 41:41.480
Remember, if you're training hard,
he may be training twice as hard.

41:41.554 --> 41:44.352
You just gotta keep coming back stronger.

41:45.325 --> 41:46.349
Right.

41:46.426 --> 41:49.884
AlI the way, Louie,
you'lI never get this chance again.

41:50.063 --> 41:51.325
AlI the way.

42:14.354 --> 42:17.551
Look like a road map back here
with fingers alI over it.

42:17.624 --> 42:18.716
Yeah?

42:30.170 --> 42:32.297
Yeah, that's getting closer.

42:52.025 --> 42:53.117
Four.

42:54.694 --> 42:55.786
Five.

42:57.497 --> 42:58.555
Six.

42:59.999 --> 43:01.159
Seven.

43:21.023 --> 43:22.285
Two more.

43:25.094 --> 43:26.152
One.

43:27.263 --> 43:28.321
Two.

43:30.066 --> 43:31.226
Three.

43:32.802 --> 43:34.702
Four. Keep going.

43:35.304 --> 43:37.101
Five. Keep going.

43:38.007 --> 43:39.065
Six.

43:40.943 --> 43:42.103
Seven.

43:46.883 --> 43:48.043
Eight.

43:48.684 --> 43:49.912
Come on.

43:50.853 --> 43:52.514
Let's get serious.

43:57.493 --> 43:58.721
Two more.

43:59.128 --> 44:01.460
Two more, no matter what.

44:08.771 --> 44:12.229
One more, Eddie. Flex when you come up.

44:12.341 --> 44:13.569
Goddamn.

44:17.113 --> 44:18.512
That's good.

44:56.552 --> 45:00.283
<i>The body that isn't used to
maybe the ninth, tenth...</i>

45:00.356 --> 45:03.052
<i>eleventh, and twelfth rep
with a certain weight.</i>

45:03.125 --> 45:06.925
<i>So that makes the body grow, then.
Going through this pain barrier.</i>

45:06.996 --> 45:10.432
Experiencing pain
in your muscles and aching...

45:10.499 --> 45:13.195
and just go on and go on.

45:13.269 --> 45:16.136
And this last
two or three or four repetitions...

45:16.205 --> 45:18.332
that's what makes the muscle then grow.

45:18.407 --> 45:22.741
And that divides one from a champion
and one from not being a champion.

45:22.812 --> 45:26.304
lf you can go through this pain barrier,
you may get to be a champion.

45:26.382 --> 45:28.407
lf you can't go through, forget it.

45:28.484 --> 45:31.817
And that's what most people lack,
is having the guts.

45:32.488 --> 45:36.720
The guts to go in and just say, ''I'lI go
through and I don't care what happens.''

45:36.792 --> 45:41.058
lt aches, and if I falI down....
I have no fear of fainting in a gym...

45:41.130 --> 45:43.291
because I know it could happen.

45:43.366 --> 45:45.994
I threw up many times
while I was working out.

45:46.068 --> 45:49.162
But it doesn't matter,
because it's alI worth it.

46:06.656 --> 46:08.283
<i>Franco Colombu.</i>

46:08.391 --> 46:11.849
<i>The premier bodybuilder
in the world under 200 pounds.</i>

46:12.028 --> 46:14.997
<i>Five times a contender
for the Mr. Olympia title...</i>

46:15.064 --> 46:17.760
<i>he plans to win it this year from Arnold.</i>

46:18.567 --> 46:21.092
<i>Once the featherweight
boxing champion of Italy...</i>

46:21.170 --> 46:24.105
<i>Franco comes from
a smalI village in Sardinia.</i>

46:24.173 --> 46:27.506
Here, when you want to say,
''Where are you going?''

46:27.576 --> 46:30.443
Somebody says, ''Go to helI''
when they get upset.

46:30.513 --> 46:32.947
There they say, ''Go to California.''

46:33.015 --> 46:35.950
lt's like a place where you never get there.

46:36.185 --> 46:39.120
And then finally I came to California, really.

46:39.755 --> 46:43.282
And now when I go back there
and they ask me, ''Where you live?''

46:43.359 --> 46:45.156
I say, ''ln California.''

46:45.227 --> 46:48.287
They're not sure if I mean it or if I'm joking.

47:01.577 --> 47:04.137
<i>When I first started doing sports...</i>

47:04.380 --> 47:06.405
<i>my mother used to scream at me.</i>

47:06.482 --> 47:08.780
<i>She used to say, ''You don't want to work.</i>

47:08.851 --> 47:11.081
<i>''You're just trying to punch people...</i>

47:11.153 --> 47:15.055
<i>''trying to make a living without working. ''
And she was very much against that.</i>

47:15.858 --> 47:19.817
<i>But right now,
after everything went so good...</i>

47:20.629 --> 47:24.827
<i>and I won in sports and I made money...</i>

47:26.435 --> 47:28.562
<i>they are very proud about that.</i>

48:13.449 --> 48:16.885
<i>I'm the strongest bodybuilder
that ever lived, I think.</i>

48:18.220 --> 48:19.619
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

48:19.688 --> 48:23.419
<i>the strongest man in the world
is blowing up a hot-water bottle.</i>

48:23.893 --> 48:26.293
<i>That takes 600 pounds of pressure.</i>

48:28.264 --> 48:29.663
lt's gonna pop.

48:51.387 --> 48:53.617
-Okay, Franco.
-Lazy bastards.

48:53.689 --> 48:54.815
Look.

49:11.540 --> 49:12.973
I missed it.

49:14.176 --> 49:15.234
Okay.

49:24.386 --> 49:26.149
<i>I met Arnold in Germany.</i>

49:26.522 --> 49:29.889
<i>He came to United States,
I came to United States, also.</i>

49:30.226 --> 49:32.751
<i>We went through many things together.</i>

49:33.629 --> 49:37.929
<i>And now, I wilI be competing
in the Mr. Olympia with Arnold.</i>

49:38.534 --> 49:40.832
<i>Of course, I think I'm gonna win.</i>

49:40.970 --> 49:43.165
<i>I have more definition...</i>

49:43.506 --> 49:45.565
<i>and I'm more muscular.</i>

49:46.175 --> 49:50.202
<i>But Arnold's taller than me,
and that can be one advantage for him.</i>

49:50.679 --> 49:52.840
I think I can show the best out there.

49:52.915 --> 49:56.612
The only problem now is matter
of the judges' opinion, too.

49:57.186 --> 50:00.121
You never really know
what's going to happen.

50:12.342 --> 50:13.741
Okay, Louie.

50:18.081 --> 50:19.605
No, listen.

50:20.217 --> 50:23.084
When you come out here
and you're out here....

50:23.353 --> 50:25.548
Right? They're alI waiting for you, Louie.

50:25.622 --> 50:28.489
They wanna see what you got,
they've never seen you before.

50:28.558 --> 50:30.321
You tense your legs, right?

50:30.393 --> 50:31.917
Then you look at the crowd.

50:31.995 --> 50:34.793
They're alI looking at you.
Flashbulbs going off and all.

50:35.332 --> 50:37.391
Then you put your arms like this.

50:37.467 --> 50:40.868
You look at your arms
like you're admiring, right?

50:40.937 --> 50:44.168
You're admiring what you're gonna
show them. And then you go....

50:44.241 --> 50:45.708
Boom! Like you're saying:

50:45.775 --> 50:47.572
''Take a look at this hunk of man.''

50:47.644 --> 50:49.669
Something like that. You try it now.

50:54.017 --> 50:56.008
Look up, that's right.

50:56.386 --> 50:59.253
That's it. No, down here, Louie.

50:59.322 --> 51:02.018
I told you, look at your arms down here.

51:02.192 --> 51:03.318
Look at both arms.

51:03.393 --> 51:04.883
-Both arms?
-Right.

51:04.961 --> 51:06.485
That's it.

51:06.630 --> 51:07.824
Atta boy.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.195
Now hold that pose.

51:09.266 --> 51:11.860
Because remember,
your arms are bigger than Arnold's.

51:11.935 --> 51:13.596
They wanna see them, right?

51:13.670 --> 51:16.298
They have never seen your arms.
They've seen Arnold's.

51:16.373 --> 51:17.840
So hold that pose a while.

51:17.908 --> 51:20.900
And I say, this pose,
just tilt your body a little...

51:20.977 --> 51:23.275
because people on this side of the theater...

51:23.346 --> 51:25.780
and people on this side wanna see you.

51:25.849 --> 51:29.615
So tilt your body just slightly like this.
Try that, Lou.

51:31.988 --> 51:32.920
Atta boy.

51:32.989 --> 51:37.483
<i>You have to do everything possible to win.
You know, no matter what.</i>

51:38.662 --> 51:41.426
The day of the contest,
if he comes in his best shape...

51:41.498 --> 51:43.466
and he's equally as good as I am...

51:43.533 --> 51:46.525
or if, let's say,
he's a few percent better than I am...

51:47.804 --> 51:50.898
I spend with him one night.

51:51.675 --> 51:54.838
I go downstairs
and book us together in a room...

51:56.479 --> 51:59.039
to help him for tomorrow's contest.

51:59.649 --> 52:00.809
And...

52:02.953 --> 52:04.443
that night...

52:05.822 --> 52:07.517
he wilI never forget.

52:10.093 --> 52:11.754
I wilI mix him up.

52:12.228 --> 52:15.755
He wilI come so ready
to South Africa, so strong.

52:15.832 --> 52:18.733
But by the time the night is over,
the next morning...

52:18.802 --> 52:20.793
he wilI be ready to lose.

52:20.870 --> 52:24.670
I mean I wilI just talk him into that,
it's no problem to do.

52:25.675 --> 52:28.667
So, alI those things are available.

52:29.012 --> 52:32.004
And if they're available,
you might as welI use them.

52:32.082 --> 52:34.915
So it doesn't matter
if he comes in shape, or out of shape.

52:34.985 --> 52:38.682
lf he comes out of shape,
at least it's less hassle for me.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.790
And if he's in shape....

52:41.458 --> 52:43.892
Fine, I hope he is.

52:45.862 --> 52:49.263
But you couldn't pulI this with Franco.
Franco's pretty smart.

52:49.332 --> 52:52.426
Franco is pretty smart, but Franco is a child.

52:54.704 --> 52:58.435
When it comes to
the day of the contest, I'm his father.

52:59.109 --> 53:01.134
He comes to me for advices.

53:02.278 --> 53:05.406
So, it's not that hard for me to give him...

53:07.617 --> 53:09.107
the wrong advices.

53:22.098 --> 53:23.998
<i>Pretoria, South Africa.</i>

53:32.842 --> 53:36.505
Probably in an hour or two,
we have a chance to see our room.

53:38.148 --> 53:39.740
10 minutes.

53:41.551 --> 53:43.678
I promise.

53:43.753 --> 53:46.984
Can I just ask you one question?
The usuaI we ask.

53:47.924 --> 53:49.585
What must your...

53:51.061 --> 53:53.052
speciaI woman look like?

53:56.466 --> 53:58.331
lt really doesn't matter.

53:59.335 --> 54:02.304
I like them with black hair,
with brown hair, with red hair.

54:02.372 --> 54:06.536
With big breasts, with little breasts,
with big ass, with a little ass.

54:06.609 --> 54:09.635
lf the personality is great
and if they're charming....

54:09.712 --> 54:12.545
Wonderful, nothing to do,
just lay out in the sunshine.

54:12.615 --> 54:15.550
Can't wait to get into the sun.
Look at that sun out there.

54:15.618 --> 54:16.949
We ordered it for you.

54:18.321 --> 54:20.016
Watch out now, Lou.

54:21.791 --> 54:24.487
-This is good.
-Get ready.

54:26.062 --> 54:27.723
Holy cow.

54:28.731 --> 54:30.392
He likes the oil.

54:30.900 --> 54:34.597
Hold it up, that a boy, Lou.
Tense your muscles, Louie.

54:35.972 --> 54:37.234
PulI in your stomach.

54:40.076 --> 54:42.442
Sometimes when people ask you advice...

54:42.512 --> 54:46.915
if you think that they're being arrogant,
or misusing the sport of bodybuilding...

54:46.983 --> 54:49.247
you give them kind of pranksterish advice.

54:49.319 --> 54:52.447
And that's once happened
in a Mr. Munich contest, I believe.

54:52.722 --> 54:55.384
I think it was eight years ago...

54:56.092 --> 54:58.856
when some fella came to me
in the gym and said:

54:59.529 --> 55:02.965
''I want to win Mr. Munich.
I am a perfect poser...

55:03.633 --> 55:06.124
''and I have a fantastic body.

55:06.402 --> 55:10.168
''And I just want to learn
a new posing routine, a new style.

55:10.540 --> 55:13.270
''Something way out
which nobody expects.''

55:13.610 --> 55:17.239
So I said, ''Let me see
your posing routine you have right now.''

55:17.313 --> 55:20.646
When the guy took his clothes off
and posed for me...

55:22.018 --> 55:25.044
he looked like nothing, number one,
and his posing was bad.

55:25.121 --> 55:28.215
So I mean, he was just....
I think he was crazy.

55:28.591 --> 55:31.958
So I thought, okay,
if he thinks that he's the best poser...

55:32.028 --> 55:35.486
I'm gonna pulI a little trick on him.
And so that's what I did.

55:35.565 --> 55:39.228
I said, ''Listen, I have a new posing routine
from America.

55:39.302 --> 55:43.295
''I'm in correspondence with
alI the top athletes in America.'' And so on.

55:43.373 --> 55:46.035
And I told him that the new thing is...

55:46.109 --> 55:48.839
that he has to scream while he's posing.

55:50.046 --> 55:51.741
And he looked at me and he says...

55:51.814 --> 55:54.612
''That's a new idea.
That wilI really come out impressive.

55:54.684 --> 55:57.812
''When you go out on stage and scream,
people can't miss you.

55:57.887 --> 56:00.287
''They'lI alI look at you screaming, that's it.''

56:00.590 --> 56:02.820
So I taught him how to scream.

56:02.892 --> 56:04.519
First of all, I oiled him up.

56:04.594 --> 56:06.960
His body, with really heavy oil
and everything.

56:07.030 --> 56:09.089
We're standing there in the shower room.

56:09.165 --> 56:11.395
And I taught him how to do it.

56:11.668 --> 56:15.604
The higher your arms go up,
the higher you make a screaming noise.

56:15.672 --> 56:19.369
And the lower your arms come down,
the lower the noise.

56:20.843 --> 56:22.401
This kind of a thing.

56:22.478 --> 56:25.106
I practiced with him for around two hours.

56:25.181 --> 56:28.776
Spent a lot of time on developing
his new posing routine.

56:28.851 --> 56:31.217
And he mastered it very well.

56:31.287 --> 56:34.984
He was screaming really loud
and high and low.

56:35.725 --> 56:38.421
And he went to the Mr. Munich contest.

56:38.528 --> 56:42.328
I told him when he walks out,
he has to scream loud, run out.

56:43.466 --> 56:44.797
And so he did.

56:44.867 --> 56:47.335
And obviously people weren't ready
for that at all.

56:47.403 --> 56:49.598
And so, he went out there, screamed loud.

56:49.672 --> 56:52.232
Went through three or four poses
with loud screaming.

56:52.308 --> 56:54.776
They carried him off the stage
and threw him out.

56:54.844 --> 56:56.903
They thought the guy was totally nuts.

57:56.750 --> 57:58.513
I'm shaking, really.

58:03.490 --> 58:07.620
But when I get there,
I think I'lI forget about it.

58:09.630 --> 58:11.530
-Forget about it?
-Yeah.

58:11.698 --> 58:14.758
When I get there, I'm even more nervous.

58:16.069 --> 58:17.969
I'm not nervous at all.

58:19.339 --> 58:20.704
Thank you.

58:21.008 --> 58:22.498
Jesus Christ.

58:22.909 --> 58:25.173
-Take it easy.
-What can I say?

58:25.412 --> 58:28.381
You guys are psyching me out here
early in the morning.

58:29.883 --> 58:33.080
-The only way to do it.
-Lay down in the bus in the back.

58:33.153 --> 58:36.452
Hey, Lou. ls this the master plan
here this morning?

58:36.523 --> 58:38.457
Right, be on guard.

58:38.525 --> 58:42.552
I'm here now for six days
and nobody invited me for breakfast.

58:42.629 --> 58:47.191
This morning they say, ''Come for breakfast
with us, Arnold, have a nice breakfast.''

58:48.068 --> 58:51.367
He's talking about pumping up.
He's talking about psyching me out.

58:51.471 --> 58:53.462
She's talking about my mother.

58:54.641 --> 58:56.802
You're the king of kings, Arnold.

59:00.380 --> 59:02.940
Shit. He's rubbing it in.

59:07.120 --> 59:08.678
How are you doing, Lou?

59:08.755 --> 59:10.279
-How you doing?
-Good.

59:10.357 --> 59:12.450
Look kind of worried today.

59:12.793 --> 59:15.125
Just a little tired, gotta wake up.

59:15.195 --> 59:18.028
-They don't come nicer than you, Arnold.
-I'm a nice guy.

59:18.098 --> 59:22.501
I wouldn't turn my back on you, Arnold,
within 500 yards.

59:24.438 --> 59:26.235
You don't trust me, why's that?

59:26.306 --> 59:30.174
They should have the Olympia early on
so we could relax, enjoy the country.

59:30.243 --> 59:33.474
They should have it in a month for him.
He isn't even in shape yet.

59:33.547 --> 59:36.641
He didn't get the timing right,
I'm telling you.

59:36.983 --> 59:39.451
A month from now would have been
perfect for you.

59:39.519 --> 59:42.147
But then I'd get bigger, too, again...

59:42.589 --> 59:45.888
so doesn't matter, what the hell.
Let's get it over with.

59:47.294 --> 59:50.286
And if you retire this year,
you just never had the Olympia.

59:50.363 --> 59:52.661
But you had twice the Universe,
what the hell.

59:52.733 --> 59:54.223
That's not too bad, either.

59:54.301 --> 59:56.531
You could go on and win the next five years.

59:56.603 --> 01:00:01.006
lt's amazing. Can you imagine
the feeling I have? Six times Mr. Olympia.

01:00:01.074 --> 01:00:04.134
I told you,
you've found the fountain of youth.

01:00:04.878 --> 01:00:06.505
You could go on forever.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.606
-lt blows my mind when I think about it.
-People are so tired--

01:00:09.683 --> 01:00:12.379
I called my mother yesterday already
and I said, ''I won.''

01:00:12.452 --> 01:00:14.682
She says, ''Congratulations, Arnold.''

01:00:15.422 --> 01:00:18.016
Anyway, listen, guys, why don't we go?

01:00:18.358 --> 01:00:20.485
You go and help him pump up.

01:00:21.728 --> 01:00:25.960
Calm him down, help him. Okay?
Don't screw him up this time.

01:00:26.032 --> 01:00:28.466
I don't want you in our pumping room.

01:00:32.973 --> 01:00:34.167
<i>Judges.</i>

01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:39.111
<i>FinaI attention,
you alI understand our strict code and rule.</i>

01:00:39.746 --> 01:00:42.442
<i>No talking whilst adjudicating.</i>

01:00:42.616 --> 01:00:46.450
And that also means, photographers,
please do not speak to the judges.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.351
I'lI simply wilI have to remove....

01:00:48.421 --> 01:00:52.653
<i>Most of the judging at an international
competition takes place during the day...</i>

01:00:52.726 --> 01:00:56.287
<i>before the crowds and distractions
of the nighttime show.</i>

01:00:56.363 --> 01:00:57.955
<i>This is called the prejudging.</i>

01:00:58.131 --> 01:00:59.894
Double biceps, rear.

01:01:00.734 --> 01:01:02.725
<i>The judges look for three things.:</i>

01:01:02.803 --> 01:01:07.103
<i>symmetry, proportion and the size
and clarity of each muscle group.</i>

01:01:08.141 --> 01:01:11.133
<i>Olympia contestants
are judged in two classes.</i>

01:01:11.211 --> 01:01:13.805
<i>Those over 200 pounds and those under.</i>

01:01:14.181 --> 01:01:18.379
<i>At night, the two class winners
wilI pose off for the overalI title.</i>

01:01:18.652 --> 01:01:22.315
<i>Each class poses first as a group,
for comparison judging.</i>

01:01:23.023 --> 01:01:26.959
<i>Then they come on one at a time
to perform the six compulsory poses...</i>

01:01:27.027 --> 01:01:28.892
<i>that show every part of the body.</i>

01:01:30.597 --> 01:01:32.087
He's so crazy.

01:01:32.465 --> 01:01:34.023
What a monster.

01:01:34.201 --> 01:01:35.600
Oh, my God.

01:01:36.436 --> 01:01:38.734
These guys are like animals, man.

01:01:38.805 --> 01:01:41.205
I can't believe it. Look at this one now.

01:01:41.308 --> 01:01:44.072
See, this is the hard part right here,
look at that.

01:01:49.316 --> 01:01:51.375
And your lats from the rear.

01:01:52.352 --> 01:01:54.343
What's he got? Let's see.

01:01:57.057 --> 01:01:59.423
You can calI him ''the bat'' from now on.

01:01:59.526 --> 01:02:02.154
-''Franco the bat.''
-He could fly with that.

01:02:05.699 --> 01:02:08.099
Finish with the left side chest...

01:02:09.035 --> 01:02:10.969
and your optionaI routine.

01:02:15.342 --> 01:02:17.037
Nice shot, goddamn it.

01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:19.943
That guy....
lt gives you chills when you watch that guy.

01:02:20.013 --> 01:02:22.914
I know. lsn't it unbelievable?

01:02:26.019 --> 01:02:27.452
Look.

01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:32.249
<i>Ed Corney, a 44-year-old nightclub owner
originally from Hawaii.</i>

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:36.626
<i>He is Franco's chief competition
in the under-200-pound class.</i>

01:02:38.164 --> 01:02:39.893
Can you believe that?

01:02:41.434 --> 01:02:44.767
I mean, that's what I calI posing.

01:02:49.943 --> 01:02:52.673
Okay, turn to your right,
Serge, face that way.

01:02:54.614 --> 01:02:57.105
Turn right on. Look straight ahead.

01:02:58.151 --> 01:03:00.415
That's it. That's the position we want.

01:03:00.487 --> 01:03:04.287
<i>An unexpected entry
in the talI class of the Olympia contest.</i>

01:03:04.391 --> 01:03:07.189
<i>Serge Nubret, 4 1 years old.</i>

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.191
<i>Six feet, 200 pounds.</i>

01:03:09.763 --> 01:03:13.130
<i>Mr. France,
and a movie and television star in Europe.</i>

01:03:30.884 --> 01:03:34.081
Don't lean back too much,
you get wrinkles in the back.

01:03:35.755 --> 01:03:37.848
-Don't go back too much.
-AlI right.

01:04:34.318 --> 01:04:35.649
Okay, thank you.

01:04:51.235 --> 01:04:52.930
Your back was out of sight.

01:04:54.171 --> 01:04:55.798
Your back, fantastic.

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:01.268
Do I need more arm?

01:05:01.545 --> 01:05:04.241
Louie, you should've
did this one for your arms.

01:05:04.715 --> 01:05:07.275
They called it. I didn't wanna look small.

01:05:07.685 --> 01:05:09.312
You mean this one?

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:10.951
No. You're wrong.

01:05:11.021 --> 01:05:13.182
-Okay.
-Look, looks like nothing.

01:05:13.257 --> 01:05:17.091
The arms are important. You've got arms,
and he's got spaghetti arms, Louie.

01:05:31.742 --> 01:05:33.710
<i>I don't have any weak points.</i>

01:05:35.546 --> 01:05:37.980
<i>I had weak points a few years ago.</i>

01:05:38.249 --> 01:05:42.049
<i>But my main thing in mind is....</i>

01:05:42.119 --> 01:05:45.316
<i>My goaI always was to even out everything...</i>

01:05:45.389 --> 01:05:48.483
<i>to the point that everything is perfect.</i>

01:05:48.792 --> 01:05:52.319
<i>Which means if I want to increase
one muscle a half inch...</i>

01:05:52.396 --> 01:05:54.330
<i>the rest of the body has to increase.</i>

01:05:54.398 --> 01:05:57.595
<i>I would never just
make one muscle increase or decrease.</i>

01:05:57.701 --> 01:06:00.067
<i>Because everything fits together now.</i>

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:04.106
<i>And alI I have to do now is get
my posing routine down more perfect...</i>

01:06:04.174 --> 01:06:06.574
<i>Which is almost impossible to do.</i>

01:06:07.478 --> 01:06:09.309
<i>It's perfect already.</i>

01:06:09.446 --> 01:06:12.074
Yeah, it's down to a point.

01:06:12.249 --> 01:06:14.012
Wait when you see it.

01:07:15.279 --> 01:07:16.439
Relax.

01:07:29.627 --> 01:07:31.288
Thank you, Arnold.

01:07:36.066 --> 01:07:37.533
lf you want to be a champion...

01:07:37.601 --> 01:07:41.970
you cannot have any kind of an outside
negative force coming in and affect you.

01:07:42.573 --> 01:07:46.976
Let's say before a contest,
if I get emotionally involved with a girl...

01:07:47.044 --> 01:07:49.638
that can have a negative effect on my mind...

01:07:49.713 --> 01:07:53.706
and therefore destroy my workout.
So I have to cut my emotions off...

01:07:53.784 --> 01:07:57.777
and be kind of cold, in a way,
before a competition.

01:07:57.855 --> 01:08:00.380
That's what you do
with the rest of the things.

01:08:00.457 --> 01:08:04.359
lf somebody steals my car
outside of my door right now...

01:08:04.561 --> 01:08:07.121
I don't care. I can't be bothered with that.

01:08:07.197 --> 01:08:11.657
I would only have my secretary call
the insurance agency and laugh about it.

01:08:11.735 --> 01:08:15.262
Because I cannot be bothered with it.
I trained myself for that.

01:08:15.372 --> 01:08:18.808
To be totally cold
and not have things go into my mind.

01:08:18.908 --> 01:08:22.174
And it was, in a way, a sad story...

01:08:23.046 --> 01:08:24.844
when my father died.

01:08:25.783 --> 01:08:29.344
Because my mother called me
on the phone, and she said:

01:08:30.953 --> 01:08:32.386
''Your dad died.''

01:08:32.456 --> 01:08:35.448
And this was exactly two months
before a contest.

01:08:35.559 --> 01:08:38.790
She says, ''You come home to the funeral?''
I said, ''No.

01:08:38.862 --> 01:08:42.059
''lt's too late, he's dead,
there's nothing to be done.

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:46.693
''And I'm sorry, I can't come.''

01:08:46.804 --> 01:08:50.205
And I didn't explain to her
really the reasons why.

01:08:50.274 --> 01:08:54.540
I had other excuses to her,
because how do you explain a mother...

01:08:54.611 --> 01:08:57.478
whose husband died, you know, your trip?

01:08:57.648 --> 01:08:59.444
I didn't bother with it.

01:08:59.515 --> 01:09:03.782
And that actually caused
one of the greatest conflicts...

01:09:05.022 --> 01:09:07.923
with my girlfriend.
Because she just looked at me and said:

01:09:07.991 --> 01:09:09.652
''lt doesn't bother you?

01:09:09.727 --> 01:09:12.457
''I mean, your father died.''

01:09:13.831 --> 01:09:15.924
I never talk about it again.

01:09:22.639 --> 01:09:25.233
<i>The finals of the Mr. Olympia contest.</i>

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:28.837
<i>First to be judged
is the under-200-pound class.</i>

01:09:59.076 --> 01:10:01.567

01:10:08.018 --> 01:10:10.543
-Take your time, you got alI the time.
-Yeah.

01:10:16.193 --> 01:10:19.959
<i>Second place
in the under-200-pound category...</i>

01:10:20.597 --> 01:10:23.122

<i>Ed Corney!</i>

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:34.727
<i>And the winner...</i>

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:39.538
<i>of the 1975 Mr. Olympia,
under 200 pounds...</i>

01:10:41.242 --> 01:10:44.370
<i>from the United States of America, via Italy...</i>

01:10:44.712 --> 01:10:46.270
<i>Franco Columbu!</i>

01:10:58.693 --> 01:11:00.661
What did you say, Louie?

01:11:01.796 --> 01:11:03.855
-What did you say?
-I'm training, Arnold.

01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:06.798
-Gotta get a good pump.
-You make too much noise.

01:11:07.368 --> 01:11:10.166
Supposed to be very quiet here,
like in a church.

01:11:20.915 --> 01:11:22.212
TelI him.

01:12:07.962 --> 01:12:10.760
-I can take you.
-Keep looking.

01:12:12.466 --> 01:12:14.593
-Thanks a lot.
-You've got a better neck.

01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:15.863
I know.

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:44.928
-I watch you.
-I watch you, too.

01:12:45.967 --> 01:12:49.767
There's a barbelI above my head,
I better watch it here.

01:12:54.275 --> 01:12:55.367
Okay.

01:12:56.811 --> 01:12:59.143
We don't want no accidents here.

01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:07.087
What symmetry you've got. You look
like something Michelangelo cut out.

01:13:08.322 --> 01:13:11.018
More oil, more. That's not good oil.

01:13:18.332 --> 01:13:20.425
-Lou, relax.
-Would you?

01:13:21.736 --> 01:13:24.330
-TelI them that we're ready.
-We are ready.

01:13:25.773 --> 01:13:28.401
<i>And now we come to the heavyweights...</i>

01:13:29.043 --> 01:13:30.635
<i>over 200 pounds.</i>

01:13:31.746 --> 01:13:33.771
<i>We have three contestants.</i>

01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:37.642
<i>From the United States of America...</i>

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.787

<i>Now we'lI calI on alI three contestants...</i>

01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:31.930

and Arnold Schwarzenegger...</i>

01:14:32.006 --> 01:14:35.134
<i>for a pose-down
for the finaI decision from the judges.</i>

01:15:25.793 --> 01:15:28.591
<i>Louie goes through his posing,
and you watch every pose.</i>

01:15:28.662 --> 01:15:31.324
<i>You sort of help him out, easy now.</i>

01:15:31.532 --> 01:15:34.933
<i>Each pose he goes through,
you're living it with him.</i>

01:15:40.374 --> 01:15:44.208
<i>I mean, you just have to try
to understand what I'm trying to telI you.</i>

01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:46.678
<i>That you're actually
out there with your son...</i>

01:15:46.747 --> 01:15:50.012
<i>because you trained with him
and you're posing with him.</i>

01:15:50.084 --> 01:15:53.019
<i>The only thing you're not doing with him...</i>

01:15:53.087 --> 01:15:55.385
<i>you're not getting
the reward of the applause.</i>

01:15:55.456 --> 01:15:58.823
<i>He's the one that's getting that,
and he deserves it.</i>

01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:01.557
<i>And you just hope
the audience gives him more.</i>

01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:03.790
<i>You wanna shout out,
''It's my son out there!</i>

01:16:03.864 --> 01:16:07.800
<i>''Give him just a few more handshakes,
a few more applause. ''</i>

01:16:07.868 --> 01:16:11.167
<i>And you just hope
that he's the winner, that's all.</i>

01:16:44.071 --> 01:16:47.734
<i>Third place, from United States of America...</i>

01:16:48.943 --> 01:16:50.376

<i>Second place, from France, Serge Nubret.</i>

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.141
<i>And the winner...</i>

01:17:28.215 --> 01:17:31.241
<i>the one and only, Arnold Schwarzenegger!</i>

01:17:41.028 --> 01:17:44.191
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the two body-weight winners...</i>

01:17:44.465 --> 01:17:46.456
<i>Franco and Arnold.</i>

01:17:47.935 --> 01:17:50.233
Come on, Franco, give him hell.

01:17:51.939 --> 01:17:54.703
-This little guy he's talking about.
-Where is he?

01:18:26.406 --> 01:18:27.737
Turn around.

01:18:30.844 --> 01:18:32.004
Let's go.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.947

01:19:32.372 --> 01:19:35.569
Louie, you're a baby, Lou.
These guys are alI veterans.

01:19:35.642 --> 01:19:39.134
You're just growing.
This takes years and years.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.709
ln two years, Louie,
they'lI have never seen anything like you.

01:19:43.883 --> 01:19:46.784
They'lI think you were carved out of stone.

01:19:48.388 --> 01:19:50.788
Just gives you
the motivation to train harder.

01:19:50.857 --> 01:19:52.381
Your day wilI come, Louie.

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:55.758
Someday you'lI have a back,
Louie, nobody ever seen.

01:19:55.829 --> 01:20:00.061
So it's no more, because it was
my last year of competition.

01:20:00.633 --> 01:20:05.195
I would like to announce officially
I'm retiring from bodybuilding competition.

01:20:05.438 --> 01:20:08.373
I would like to thank you all
for supporting me.

01:20:08.441 --> 01:20:10.432
I would like to thank the judges.

01:20:10.643 --> 01:20:13.134
Bodybuilding has been
a beautifuI experience for me.

01:20:13.213 --> 01:20:15.704
And I wilI continue it for the rest of my life.

01:20:15.782 --> 01:20:18.945
I only stop competing,
but I'm not stopping bodybuilding.

01:20:19.019 --> 01:20:21.544
lt's the greatest sport. Thank you.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.663
<i>I want to have everybody sing
Happy Birthday to Lou...</i>

01:20:36.736 --> 01:20:38.829
because it's Lou's birthday today.

01:20:38.905 --> 01:20:41.237
