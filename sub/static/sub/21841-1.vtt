- Or crying, or worse,
and you know, I mean,

01:13.374 --> 01:15.643
that's when I knew
I had to end things with her.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.711
You know?
So cut to five months later.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.213
I moved out, right?

01:19.247 --> 01:20.814
Same woman I broke up with

01:20.848 --> 01:22.883
shows up
at my door wearing heels

01:22.916 --> 01:24.718
and not much else, Dr. Jen.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.421
- And was this visit expected?

01:27.455 --> 01:28.489
- Hell, no.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.890
I mean, my new girlfriend,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.825
also an ex now,
opened the door.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.661
Yeah.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.663
She opened the door
to my admittedly hot,

01:35.696 --> 01:38.299
nearly nude ex-girlfriend.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.900
The thing is, Dr. Jen,

01:39.933 --> 01:42.270
I can't seem the find
the whole package.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.705
- I mean, being clear
on what you want

01:44.738 --> 01:46.140
is gonna help to figure out

01:46.174 --> 01:47.841
what is gonna fit into your life

01:47.875 --> 01:50.344
and what isn't.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.545
Look, let's try this.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.814
Why don't you tell me,

01:53.847 --> 01:56.417
what are the traits
of your perfect person?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.885
You know, what is she like?

01:57.918 --> 01:59.620
What does she look like?

01:59.653 --> 02:02.323
- Well, she's got to be smart,
educated,

02:02.356 --> 02:04.225
have a successful career
of her own.

02:04.258 --> 02:07.695
You know, actually, Dr. Jen,
now that I think of it,

02:07.728 --> 02:09.363
you are what I'm looking for.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.564
You're together.

02:10.598 --> 02:11.865
You're a relationship expert.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.467
You are the whole package.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.536
Hey, how about dinner sometime?

02:15.569 --> 02:19.540
- Kyle, I am--I'm so flattered,
and thank you so much.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.376
But I'm taken.

02:22.410 --> 02:26.514
I do wish you so much luck
in this quest,

02:26.547 --> 02:30.551
and remember, you create
the love that you deserve.

02:30.584 --> 02:34.555
Up next, we have
Lilith on line six.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.923
Hello, Lilith.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.958
- I'm here.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.628
- My screener said you had
a question about siblings.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.664
- That's right.
But why would I ask you?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.533
You think you're such an expert?

02:45.566 --> 02:48.569
A little birdie told me
your family's a total mess.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.772
Isn't that right?

02:51.805 --> 02:56.344
- You know, the family dynamic
is complex,

02:56.377 --> 02:58.879
mine included.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.949
It's how you handle these
situations that really matter.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.685
- Why don't you
talk about deadbeat dads

03:04.718 --> 03:07.321
or moms with endless streams
of boyfriends?

03:07.355 --> 03:09.890
Or how about commitment-phobic
career women?

03:09.923 --> 03:10.991
Huh?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.726
Huh?
[chuckles]

03:12.760 --> 03:14.395
- You sound
really angry, Lilith.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.896
- You think you're some expert.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.631
Well, you're no expert.
You're just a fake.

right after this.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.455
- It's for my mom, Georgina.
- Aww.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.357
- So is it true you're
working on another book?

03:43.391 --> 03:44.725
- Yes.
It comes out this Christmas.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.660
- Is there anything you could
tell us about it?

03:46.694 --> 03:48.329
- I can't say too much quite
yet, but if you keep listening,

03:48.362 --> 03:49.563
I promise there'll be
some sneak-peeks.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.564
- Oh, we will.
- Thank you.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.400
Nice to meet you guys.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.501
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Thank you.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.835
- Thanks, Dr. Jen.
- Hey, look.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.704
- It's so good.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.038
- You're a liar.
- Oh, my--

do you think you're doing?

- I hate--let me go.
Let me go.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.345
- What do you think
you're doing?

04:04.378 --> 04:05.679

You're a fake.

You're a fake!
I hate you! Let me go.

chill, chill.

- All right, we're taking her in
to process and arrest.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.495
- No, no, no. But why does
she have to be arrested?

04:21.529 --> 04:22.730
- It was an assault.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.598

- Right.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.634
But I'm not pressing
criminal charges.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.702
- Jen, why not? She's dangerous.
She might hurt somebody else.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.971
- She assaulted you.
- She needs mental care,

04:31.004 --> 04:32.906
not to be caged up
like an animal.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.444
- You got no say over me,
bitch.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.046
- She seems like
a total nut job, Jen.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.549
- [sighs]

04:41.582 --> 04:43.651
She's my sister, Gail.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.655
- Wait.
That's Cassie?

04:51.425 --> 04:55.095
- She needs psychiatric care.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.097
- It's your call, doctor.
- You can't do this to me.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.866
What about my girls?

04:58.899 --> 05:01.669
What's gonna happen to my girls?

05:01.702 --> 05:04.572
- I'll make arrangements with
social services, get my nieces.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.039
They can stay with me.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.875
I'm next of kin.

- Listen.
I need to warn you.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.139
It's pretty bad in there.

Quite the decorating job,

considering they've only
been here four months.

you can never find them.

in any place long enough.

You're both so grown up,
I can't even tell you apart.

to pack your things.

It's best we get
to your aunt's house soon.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.966
- How long do we have
to be with her?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.103
- You know, your mother is
with the best doctors.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.939
She's getting the best care
that there is.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.675
You just have to stay with me
until she's better.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.777
In the meantime, we get to spend
some time together

07:23.811 --> 07:25.513
and get to know
each other again.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.150
I missed you both so much.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.522

- Well, the nice news is that
you guys have summer break.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.639
You know, we get
a nice long visit.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.674
Plus, I have a pool.
Do you guys like to swim?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.709
- Why can't we just
stay at our house?

07:55.743 --> 07:58.712
I mean, we're old enough
to take care of ourselves.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.114
- I'm sorry.
So you're Quinn, right?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.652
Okay. look.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.286
I know that this is all new,

08:06.319 --> 08:12.159
and this is sort of
a difficult time,

08:12.192 --> 08:13.961
but I think it's gonna
be really important

08:13.994 --> 08:16.163
to just stay busy at the house.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.866
You know, I have a pool.
You guys can swim.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.634
I even bought you guys
some new bikes.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.035
- Oh, bikes.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.937
That's great.
That'll fix everything.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.116
- Wow, you live around here?

08:36.149 --> 08:38.952
- I think you guys might learn
to really like it around here.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.064
Come on in.

09:42.049 --> 09:46.186
- This place looks like
some movie.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.188
- You must
be loaded.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.658
Mom said you were rich,
but not this rich.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.626
- Well, uh,

09:52.660 --> 09:55.228
I guess all the hard work
has paid off.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.031
Come on.
Let's go see your rooms.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.266
They're upstairs.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.369
Do you need help with your bag?

10:02.402 --> 10:03.771
- Mm-mm.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.982
- They're just down the hall.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.056
So the room's
just right here.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.962
So?

10:33.901 --> 10:36.670
I put up a couple things,
but I had no idea

10:36.704 --> 10:38.371
what a teenage girl
would put on her wall.

10:38.405 --> 10:42.676
So you guys feel free
to put up whatever you'd like.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.012
- There's only one bed?

10:45.045 --> 10:48.716
- That's because you guys
get your own rooms.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.417
- But we've always
shared a room.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.319
- I'm sorry.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.954
You're gonna have to help me
with this for a while.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.055
You're--

10:55.088 --> 10:57.157
- All Quinn wants to know

10:57.190 --> 11:00.994
is why you keep trying
to split up our family.

11:01.028 --> 11:04.364
- You know, Olivia, why don't
we go, check out your room?

11:04.397 --> 11:06.333
Give it a try.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.936
You might find that you
like your own space.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.337
Okay?

11:32.793 --> 11:35.362
You know, if you guys promise
to share it, you can keep it.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.164
- We had one.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.333
Mom pawned our microwave
to get it.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.401
It broke.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.907
- Well, this one's yours.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.441
- We're kind of starved.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.310
How about some of those chips?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.312
- Of course.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.247
I just--I keep them up there
because they are so addicting.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.183
So I like to keep them
out of reach.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.851
- We noticed.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.987
- So what are you
discovering on there?

12:00.020 --> 12:00.854
Anything cool?

12:27.314 --> 12:29.349
- Hmm.

That's weird.

your mom and I

went to horse camp
when we were younger.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.984
That was the first time
that we were away from our mom.

13:06.486 --> 13:10.157
It was the first time we really
felt like we had broken through.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.159
- Broken through what?

13:12.192 --> 13:14.027
- You know,

13:14.061 --> 13:18.465
our mom was really hard
on your mom

13:18.498 --> 13:20.333
when we were growing up,

13:20.367 --> 13:23.570

like about it?

- Not really.

You can stop.

with you, Jen.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.275
I'm Quinn.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.950
If you really need to know,
we come to places like this

15:16.984 --> 15:20.253
when we need to shut people
like you out.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.190
When everybody's
prying into our minds,

15:23.223 --> 15:25.725
we'll do anything
to make you go away.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.261
- I love you guys.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.264
When you love someone, you will
do anything to help them.

15:33.266 --> 15:37.370
- Nice try,
but that's psycho talk.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.007
- I can't imagine
how it must feel

15:40.040 --> 15:41.374
to suddenly feel like someone

15:41.408 --> 15:42.742
who you thought
didn't care about you

15:42.775 --> 15:46.146
for so long finally cares.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.248
You must wonder where I've been
all these years.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.451
- Maybe we didn't need you
in our life.

15:51.484 --> 15:55.255
Maybe our mom got away
from you on purpose.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.591
- All that stuff
is in the past,

15:58.625 --> 16:01.995
and I know I want you guys
to give this a chance

16:02.029 --> 16:05.532
and give us a chance,

16:05.565 --> 16:09.669
because I know
that I really want to.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.115
- How long have you
been a teacher?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.250
- Hmm.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.717
[laughs]
It's--

16:24.751 --> 16:27.454
Gosh, it's almost
been ten years.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.688
It seems like yesterday,
though.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.323
- He's really good too.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.159
Kevin's classes
always fill up.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.062
- So what grades
do you teach?

16:35.095 --> 16:37.064
- I teach science
to mostly seniors

16:37.097 --> 16:39.732
at a small
private school.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.435
- So how come you guys
aren't married?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.137
- Yeah.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.206
You afraid Jen's whacked,
like our mom?

16:46.239 --> 16:48.775
- Girls--
- It's okay.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.511
I'd be happy to answer that.

16:51.544 --> 16:56.183
Your aunt is the most
amazing woman I've ever known.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.818
And someday,
if I'm lucky,

16:58.851 --> 17:01.588
she will marry me.

17:01.621 --> 17:05.392
Now, what I want to kn is how
are you girls liking it here?

17:07.460 --> 17:10.363
- We'd feel better
if we could see our mom.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.365
- Well, I have some news.

17:12.398 --> 17:13.665
We're actually
scheduled

17:13.700 --> 17:15.734
for a visit
with your mom tomorrow.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.738
- Tomorrow?

17:18.771 --> 17:21.374
- But I need to explain
a little something to you first.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.843
I think she is planning on
being there a little bit longer

17:23.876 --> 17:26.779
than we all
originally thought.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.848
- Like, for how long?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.518
- Well, her doctor
has suggested

17:31.551 --> 17:33.820
long-term treatment.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.489
It's about three months.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.591
- So she's gonna be alone
in some creepy place

17:38.625 --> 17:40.493
for three months?

17:40.527 --> 17:43.296
- I know that it's longer
than we all thought,

17:43.330 --> 17:44.797
but she's agreed to this,

17:44.831 --> 17:46.633
and she's actually
told her doctors

17:46.666 --> 17:48.601
that she's happy about this.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.403
This is a really
good sign.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.605
- She wouldn't.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.242
- Look, I know this is
really hard to hear,

17:55.275 --> 17:56.309
but your mom needs
all the support--

17:56.343 --> 17:58.178
[glass shatters]

17:58.211 --> 17:59.446
- Quinn.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.760
- A little wine,
a little relaxation time--

18:13.793 --> 18:16.129
- Yes.
- It's gonna be okay.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.407
[glass crunching]

18:27.440 --> 18:29.276
- Ow, oh--

18:29.309 --> 18:30.910
- What?

18:30.943 --> 18:34.214
- It's glass.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.782
Oh, my God,
there's glass in my hand.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.385
- Oh, my God.
- Mm!

18:38.418 --> 18:40.453
- Come on.
Let's clean that up.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.155
- Oh, my God.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.924
[suspenseful music]

18:44.957 --> 18:51.798
*

18:58.471 --> 19:00.173
- You sure it doesn't hurt?

19:00.207 --> 19:01.774
- Yeah. It's fine.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.909
- Are you lying to me?

19:02.942 --> 19:04.777
- Yes. It hurts.

19:08.748 --> 19:09.782
- What happened?

19:12.452 --> 19:14.221
- Did we wake you guys up?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.922
- What's going on?

19:15.955 --> 19:19.392
- Oh, there was some glass
on the seat cushion outside.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.261
I cut my hand.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.662
It's nothing to worry about.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.198
- It was probably
from Quinn's glass.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.533
- How was I supposed to know?

19:26.566 --> 19:28.668
It's not like
I d it on purpose.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.902
- Okay.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.605
- I should probably
head home.

19:32.639 --> 19:33.640
- Yeah.

19:36.809 --> 19:37.810
- Good night, girls.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.817
- Okay, look.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.219
There's no sense
in blaming each other

19:46.253 --> 19:47.220
for something like this.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.588
This is an accident.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.456
- Good night.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.527
- Good night.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.800
I'm gonna go to bed,
and I think you should too.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.602
We have a big day tomorrow,

20:02.635 --> 20:04.704
and we've had enough excitement
for one night.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.839
Besides, you get
to see your mom.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.242
- Okay.
Good night, Jen.

20:09.276 --> 20:09.909
- Good night.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.625
[indistinct chatter]

20:51.784 --> 20:52.752
Thank you.

20:52.785 --> 20:53.620
- Here you go.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.368
- Ah, we finally
meet in person.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.702
I've listened
to your show for years.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.404
- Oh.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.572
- I see you got
the record you requested?

21:45.605 --> 21:47.073
- Yes, I do.
Thank you.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.841
- Hey, Doc!

21:48.875 --> 21:50.076
If she's such an expert,

21:50.109 --> 21:53.980
why am I here?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.382
Oh, I know.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.616
It's your fault I'm here.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.984
- Cassie.

21:58.017 --> 21:58.918
- You think you can
take my babies?

21:58.951 --> 22:00.520
- Nurse.

22:00.553 --> 22:01.588
- You think you can take
what's mine?

22:01.621 --> 22:02.922
They're my babies.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.557
- No. Come on.
- They're my babies.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.058
They're mine!

22:06.092 --> 22:07.727
- Okay. Relax.
- Don't escalate, Cassie.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.128
Keeping calm is important.
- My babies--let me go.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.398
They're my babies.
Girls--they're mine.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.433
- No one is taking your girls.
- They're mine. They're mine!

22:13.466 --> 22:14.534
- It's okay.
- Okay. Fine.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.051
- Okay.
What'd I miss?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.453
- The kid's
freaking out again.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.755
- He is?
- He's crazy!

23:42.789 --> 23:44.123
He's going too fast!

23:44.156 --> 23:45.992
[indistinct shouting on TV]
- [laughs]

23:46.025 --> 23:48.995
[engine revving, wheels squeal]

23:49.028 --> 23:50.530
Come on, get him!
Get him!

23:50.563 --> 23:51.764
He's just--he's over there.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.834
What are you doing?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.903
Go!

23:56.936 --> 23:59.238
[indistinct chatter on TV]

23:59.271 --> 24:00.640
- [gasps, moans]

24:05.011 --> 24:07.046
I have to go
rinse this off.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.215
Oh, I don't know
what's happening.

24:09.248 --> 24:12.151
[suspenseful music]

24:12.184 --> 24:19.025
*

24:19.058 --> 24:20.560
- How's your breathing?

24:20.593 --> 24:22.995
- It's fine, but my skin
is on fire.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.864
- Well, have you noticed any
difference in your breathing?

24:24.897 --> 24:27.567
I have your EpiPen right here.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.769
- Babe, no. It's, like,
a reaction to that cream.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.939
It hurts so bad.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.807
- Cold, cold, cold water--
cold water.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.108
That's it.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.013
You can do it.
Keep your arm in there.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.616
It's okay.
Hold still.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.586
Let the water cool the burn.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.155
- Ow.
[moans]

24:49.188 --> 24:50.957
- There you go.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.692
Give it some time.

25:22.288 --> 25:25.124
[phone buzzing]

25:33.766 --> 25:35.902
- Hey, Gail.
It's Jen. Listen.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.804
I hate to do this last-minute,

25:37.837 --> 25:40.907
but I just--I can't host
the show this week.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.275
I just got--truthfully,
it's the girls.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.912
They just--they need
more attention right now.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.815
They're really having
a hard time, and it's hard.

25:48.848 --> 25:51.117
Okay? Just run a show
from last year.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.952
Cole knows which ones
that I liked.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.354
Oh, and can you call Dr. Frank

25:55.387 --> 25:57.857
and ask if he can make
a house call today?

25:57.890 --> 26:00.326
I got a weird reaction
I want him to take a look at.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.161
All right, and Gail, thank you.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.296
I don't know
what I would do without you.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.866
Bye.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.842
Dr. Frank, thank you so much

26:15.875 --> 26:17.109
for coming out
on such short notice.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.678
- Of course.
No problem.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.980
Now, you wanted me
to look at your arm.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.381
- I know I had
a bad allergic reaction

26:22.414 --> 26:24.717
to a new moisturizer.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.753
- Yes.
Well--

26:26.786 --> 26:28.220
[chuckles]

26:28.254 --> 26:33.092
Oh, that is not
an allergic reaction, Jen.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.360
That's a burn.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.228
It's a chemical burn.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.864
It's bad too.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.799
That could've caused
severe nerve damage.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.133
- Well, needless to say,

26:41.167 --> 26:45.004
I am not gonna use
that moisturizer anymore.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.773
- Make sure to keep your arm
away from any heat,

26:46.806 --> 26:48.340
and it'll be fine.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.809
- Thank you so much
for coming out again.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.243
- Any time.
- I really appreciate it.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.144
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.126
- What you doing?
- [gasps]

28:14.160 --> 28:15.895
Don't do that.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.130
- Whoa.
What got into you?

28:18.164 --> 28:20.199
- Nothing.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.768
- Okay.
You're totally lying.

28:21.801 --> 28:22.701
What's going on?

28:26.205 --> 28:28.240
- It's my arm.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.910
Dr. Frank was right.
It's a chemical burn.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.044
- You know that for sure?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.815
- I tested it.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.417
It has pool acid in it.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.186
- Oh, my God.
- Mm-hmm.

28:40.219 --> 28:44.323
- Jen,
this is getting nuts.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.392
You could be
in real danger.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.294
You have to do something
about the girls.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.929
I mean, there's two of them,
and together, they could--

28:49.962 --> 28:51.463
- No, they're not gonna
do anything serious.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.365
They're just--

28:53.399 --> 28:55.434
They're acting out the anger
of their mother on me.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.236
- I used to act out
when I was a kid too,

28:57.269 --> 29:00.006
but it didn't involve
giving people chemical burns.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.541
What are you gonna do?

29:02.574 --> 29:05.277
- I don't know.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.246
I've also noticed
that there've been

29:07.279 --> 29:09.849
a couple things missing
around the house--

29:09.882 --> 29:11.383
some valuable things.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.319
- Well, this just keeps
getting better, doesn't it?

29:13.352 --> 29:16.856
- Mm-hmm.
And I can't accuse them.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.891
Not right now.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.326
I need them to trust me.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.061
- Well, I want them
to trust you too, Jen,

29:22.094 --> 29:23.195
but I also don't want them
running around,

29:23.229 --> 29:25.898
setting up traps for us
in the house.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.800
What if you get
some of those nanny cams?

29:27.834 --> 29:28.868
- Gail--
- Yeah.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.336
You know, the little ones.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.238
You could just hide them
in a corner, and that way,

29:32.271 --> 29:33.906
you could see what's going on
without asking them.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.308
Look. Jen, I know
that you want to trust them.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.945
But this is starting
to get scary.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.512
I mean, they've never
had a role model.

29:40.546 --> 29:43.883
We have no idea
what they're gonna do.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.853
- I knew this was
gonna be difficult.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.454
It's just gonna
take some time.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.522
- I still think that it
would be good for everyone

29:50.556 --> 29:54.927
if you knew a little bit more
about what they were up to,

29:54.961 --> 29:57.063
you know,
for their own sakes.

29:57.096 --> 29:57.964
- Yeah.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.102
- Get the nanny cams.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.555
[suspenseful music]

30:23.589 --> 30:30.462
*

31:24.050 --> 31:26.618
- Olivia, can we talk
for a second?

31:26.652 --> 31:28.087
Would you mind?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.589
- Sure.
Just me?

31:30.622 --> 31:33.292
- Do you mind?

31:33.325 --> 31:34.526
- Sure.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.439
- So what's up?

31:47.473 --> 31:50.409
- Well, one thing that

31:50.442 --> 31:54.480
I have always
admired about you,

31:54.513 --> 31:58.550
good or bad,
is that you speak your mind,

31:58.584 --> 32:03.022
and Quinn is not
always like that.

32:03.055 --> 32:06.993
You know, she holds
in her feelings,

32:07.026 --> 32:09.628
and I'm a little concerned.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.663
- What do you want me
to do about it?

32:11.697 --> 32:13.532
- Well, I was hoping you could
give me some ideas

32:13.565 --> 32:16.168
on how to talk to her.

32:16.202 --> 32:17.369
- That's it?

32:17.403 --> 32:19.438
- That's a lot.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.441
It's not easy to
share your feelings

32:22.474 --> 32:25.177
when you're not used
to being that way.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.478
You know, you guys are twins,

32:26.512 --> 32:29.348
but you're
very different people.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.483
- You're way off.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.685
Quinn agrees with me
on everything.

32:33.719 --> 32:38.057
If I say something,
she's already thinking it.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.625
We're just unhappy
that our mom's locked up

32:39.658 --> 32:42.594
and she's away from us.

32:42.628 --> 32:47.566
- I need you guys to trust
that this is the right thing.

32:47.599 --> 32:51.037
Maybe you can help Quinn
to understand that too,

32:51.070 --> 32:53.539
that I just want
what's best for your mom.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.174
We all do.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.276
Everyone is just
trying to do what's right.

33:07.753 --> 33:11.157
- Hello. It's me.
Morning!

33:11.190 --> 33:13.659
- Morning, Gail.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.628
- Hello.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.197
- There's coffee.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.199
- Oh, coffee.
I so need it today.

33:20.232 --> 33:23.269
It smells amazing.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.537
You make the best, Jen.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.615
Hey, I have an idea.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.650
What do you think
about a day off?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.452
I have a feeling
we could use a beach day.

33:40.486 --> 33:43.622
- Oh, um...I--

33:43.655 --> 33:45.424
Yeah, I think
that's a great idea.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.094
- Yeah?
What do you guys think?

33:48.127 --> 33:49.161
Beach day?

34:04.643 --> 34:06.578
- All right.
So 20 minutes, I'll be back.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.281
Is that okay?
Girls, is that all right?

34:09.315 --> 34:11.449
- We'll hold down the fort.
Have a good run.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.293
- This feels awesome.

34:22.328 --> 34:25.364
- So do you and Jen
come here often?

34:25.397 --> 34:26.565
- Not enough.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.400
- You get in.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.475
- You guys just discovered

34:36.507 --> 34:39.445
my number one favorite thing
to do at the beach.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.447
- You get in.
You get in.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.547
- Okay.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.358
[sighs]

34:52.391 --> 34:54.293
I like to bury myself

34:54.326 --> 34:56.895
like a warm, squishy cocoon.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.132
- Jen! Jen, come look!

35:00.166 --> 35:01.233
- Oh, hon,
she can't hear you.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.668
She's way too far.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.231
- Thanks.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.699
- Sure.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.502
- Quinn, you're going
to hold us up.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.171
Mom's waiting.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.206
- It's okay.
I'll finish.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.440
- Okay.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.577
- Why FaceTime?

35:45.611 --> 35:47.813
Why can't we go
and see her like last time?

35:47.846 --> 35:50.416
- Well, you know,

35:50.449 --> 35:53.252
the last visit was
really hard on your mom.

35:53.285 --> 35:56.522
The nurse thought
that this was better.

35:56.555 --> 35:59.825
I mean, this is a good step.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.193
Come on.
Let's check.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.228
Let's see if she's on there.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.200
- Hi, guys.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.469
Can you see me okay?
- Yes.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.204
- I'll be monitoring your visit.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.606
It just means I can hear you.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.907
If the call
becomes unmanageable,

36:15.941 --> 36:18.310
I'll end it immediately.
Okay?

36:18.344 --> 36:20.312
both: Okay.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.748
- You can stop the call anytime
by pushing the eject button

36:22.781 --> 36:24.616
at the top right of your screen.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.951
You got that?

36:31.623 --> 36:34.560
- Oh, God.
I miss my girls.

36:34.593 --> 36:35.627
[laughs]

36:35.661 --> 36:36.795
Olivia...

36:36.828 --> 36:39.431
- Hi, Mom.
I miss you.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.633
- And my Quinn.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.001
- Hi, Mom.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.571
- [laughs]
I missed my girls.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.773
So have you girls
been being good

36:47.806 --> 36:51.643
and being very careful
with your aunt's nice things?

36:51.677 --> 36:53.479
- Yeah. Yeah.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.581
We've totally been
good and careful and all that.

36:55.614 --> 36:57.449
- [laughs]
I knew you would be.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.851
Oh, I miss you so much,

36:59.885 --> 37:05.424
and I'm so glad you both get
to stay in her beautiful house.

37:05.457 --> 37:06.592
You're very lucky girls.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.027
- Yeah, yeah.
It's huge.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.530
And Jen gave us, like,
our own separate bedrooms,

37:11.563 --> 37:15.734
and we each get our own tub
and shower and closet.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.636
- I wish you were here, Mom.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.405
- Yeah.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.506
- Mom?

37:20.539 --> 37:21.540
- What's wrong, honey?

37:21.573 --> 37:23.609
You sound so sad.

37:23.642 --> 37:24.810
- We just want you back.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.379
We want
our old lives back.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.848
Do you really need to be there
for three months?

37:29.881 --> 37:31.617
- I do.

37:31.650 --> 37:34.286
I really do, sweetie.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.788
Being here longer
is a good thing.

37:36.822 --> 37:40.559
The best thing you two can do
is be patient.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.437
Good things come
to those who wait.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.640
[laughs]

37:54.673 --> 37:55.507
I love you.

38:04.082 --> 38:06.918
[mysterious music]

38:06.952 --> 38:13.825
*

38:43.389 --> 38:44.723
- Hey, Sissy,

38:44.756 --> 38:46.057
should we take this?

39:53.925 --> 39:56.127
"My commitment to Kevin
seems less important

39:56.161 --> 39:58.029
than helping the girls."

39:58.063 --> 40:00.532
So dramatic.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.067
The shrink needs a shrink.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.590
- I think I found it.

40:33.599 --> 40:35.901
Take a picture.

40:49.815 --> 40:54.019
- Remember, you create
the love that you deserve.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.754
- Mom's not in it.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.756
Neither are we.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.491
Everything goes to
some stupid charity.

40:59.525 --> 41:03.962
That's how much she cares
about us, Quinn.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.664
- That's all the time
we have today.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.699
I'm Dr. Jen,
and thank you for listening.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.572
- And we're off.
Great show, ladies.

41:13.605 --> 41:14.640
- Thank you, Cole.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.277
- Another day, another show.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.179
- Is the mic off?

41:21.212 --> 41:22.714
- You guys want sodas?

41:24.816 --> 41:25.817
- No, thank you.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.088
- Okay.
- It's been really bugging me.

41:30.121 --> 41:32.257
You caught them
red-handed?

41:32.290 --> 41:33.992
Well, what did they say
when you busted them?

41:35.594 --> 41:37.028
- Okay.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.867
- I didn't.
- What?

41:41.900 --> 41:44.670
Why don't you
just confront them?

41:44.703 --> 41:47.673
- What are you doing, Olivia?

41:47.706 --> 41:49.274
- They'd never understand,

41:49.307 --> 41:50.676
and they're not
taking things anymore.

41:50.709 --> 41:52.544
They were just--

41:52.578 --> 41:54.045
- Honestly, Jen, I know
you don't want to hear this,

41:54.079 --> 41:57.783
but I think they belong back
with social services.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.985
I just get a really bad
feeling about all this.

42:04.990 --> 42:06.658
- What are you doing?

42:06.692 --> 42:08.560
- Shutting her up.

42:08.594 --> 42:10.596
- Shouldn't we tell Mom?

42:10.629 --> 42:11.863
- Mom's not here.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.867
- Jen?

42:15.901 --> 42:16.868
- What is going on?

42:16.902 --> 42:18.303
- I keep feeling like

42:18.336 --> 42:20.639
Mom's going to be
abandoned by us,

42:20.672 --> 42:21.940
and I can't
deal with it knowing

42:21.973 --> 42:23.575
that we're living
in a nice house,

42:23.609 --> 42:25.944
and she's in the hospital.

42:25.977 --> 42:29.681
- Your mother does not
feel abandoned by you.

42:29.715 --> 42:31.817
She's happy that you guys
are taken care of.

42:31.850 --> 42:33.251
She wants you to have fun.

42:33.284 --> 42:36.688
- I feel bad for her.

42:36.722 --> 42:39.124
It's like we don't know
what's right anymore.

42:39.157 --> 42:41.760
- Olivia, you deserve
to be happy.

42:41.793 --> 42:44.029
- I guess.
But--

42:47.332 --> 42:49.968
Hey.

42:50.001 --> 42:52.070
what about
beach day therapy?

42:55.774 --> 42:59.377
- I think that sounds
like a great idea.

42:59.410 --> 43:02.914
- I think we could all use one
and Gail too.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.786
- I wouldn't
miss it.

43:23.869 --> 43:26.705
[waves crashing]

43:37.348 --> 43:38.917
- I'm gonna give you our stuff,

43:38.950 --> 43:40.752
and I'm gonna get
a quick run in.

43:40.786 --> 43:42.654
Okay?
- Yeah. Sounds good.

43:42.688 --> 43:44.956
- You all right with the girls?
- Oh, yeah. Have a good one.

43:58.436 --> 44:00.739
- Olivia,
why are we over here?

44:00.772 --> 44:02.373
You're leaving me out again,
aren't you?

44:07.445 --> 44:09.247
- Hey, guys.
- it's cool, isn't it?

44:09.280 --> 44:11.883
It's kind of like
our own private beach.

44:11.917 --> 44:13.151
- Yeah.

44:14.853 --> 44:16.187
- Hey, what if we have

44:16.221 --> 44:18.389
our own private spa day?

44:18.423 --> 44:22.160
Come to Private Rock Spa.

44:22.193 --> 44:25.463
- Okay.
I'll have the regular, please.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.998
- Exactly what we thought.

44:27.032 --> 44:30.101
One full-body deluxe,
your regular.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.812
We are here to please.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.380
- I see that.

44:42.413 --> 44:45.817
[laughter]

44:45.851 --> 44:47.986
- Now we just need
some sun protection.

44:51.990 --> 44:53.959
Your treatment bed awaits.

44:53.992 --> 44:56.294
- Ah, thank you.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.832
Ah.

45:00.866 --> 45:02.267
[sighs]

45:02.300 --> 45:04.135
Ah.

45:04.169 --> 45:05.771

Ah, that feels fabulous.

45:19.484 --> 45:22.854
- Now, if I could just
get some help from Quinn.

45:22.888 --> 45:25.223
Like I said, Gail's gonna need
some sunblock.

45:31.296 --> 45:33.398
Sorry.
We don't want wrinkles.

[waves crashing]

46:00.225 --> 46:01.860
- Hey, Olivia,

46:01.893 --> 46:03.194
I think we better pack it in.

46:03.228 --> 46:05.230
The tide's coming in
pretty fast.

46:09.267 --> 46:11.102
Olivia.

46:11.136 --> 46:12.503
Hey!

46:12.537 --> 46:13.538
Earth to Olivia.

46:16.574 --> 46:17.542
Hey!

46:22.213 --> 46:23.448
Olivia!

46:25.016 --> 46:26.284
Come on.
This isn't fun anymore.

46:29.955 --> 46:31.489
- It kind of is.

46:38.363 --> 46:41.332
- Olivia, help
dig me out, please.

46:41.366 --> 46:42.500
Olivia,
what are you doing?

46:42.533 --> 46:44.602
This isn't funny.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.237
- No.

46:46.271 --> 46:48.339
It's not fun, is it?

46:48.373 --> 46:49.975
Neither is
putting crazy ideas

46:50.008 --> 46:52.410
in Jen's head,
like sending us back.

Come on.
I didn't mean that.

46:58.316 --> 47:00.185
Help me out, please?

I need your help
to get out of here, please.

Olivia.

Olivia.

47:07.292 --> 47:08.493
[grunts]

47:08.526 --> 47:10.862
[waves crash]

47:10.896 --> 47:12.964
[grunting]

47:12.998 --> 47:14.332
Quinn!

47:14.365 --> 47:15.867
- [laughs]

47:15.901 --> 47:18.636
She can't hear you.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.505
No one can hear you.

47:20.538 --> 47:21.539
- Olivia.

47:21.572 --> 47:23.074
Olivia, please. Come on.

47:24.342 --> 47:26.611
Help!

47:26.644 --> 47:29.080
Please, Olivia--

47:29.114 --> 47:31.016
Stop.

47:31.049 --> 47:32.417
[coughs]
Help me--

47:32.450 --> 47:33.618
- [laughs]

47:33.651 --> 47:35.620
- Help!

47:35.653 --> 47:38.123
Quinn!

47:38.156 --> 47:39.624
Jen!

47:39.657 --> 47:42.327
[grunts]
Help!

47:42.360 --> 47:45.563
[waves crash]

47:45.596 --> 47:47.265
Help me!

47:47.298 --> 47:49.567

47:49.600 --> 47:52.470
Please, help!

47:55.606 --> 47:58.043

47:58.076 --> 47:59.410
Help me!

47:59.444 --> 48:02.247
[dramatic music]

48:02.280 --> 48:07.352
*

48:07.385 --> 48:10.188
[waves crash]

48:27.572 --> 48:28.940
- Where's Gail?

48:39.717 --> 48:42.620
[plaintive music]

48:42.653 --> 48:47.358
*

48:47.392 --> 48:50.428
- Hey, are you guys
having fun?

48:50.461 --> 48:52.263
- Yeah.

48:54.565 --> 48:57.368
- Where's Gail?

48:57.402 --> 48:59.137
- I don't know.

48:59.170 --> 49:00.271
- Huh.

49:03.474 --> 49:06.577
Well, we should probably
head back soon.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.613
What do you think?
- Hey, it's Gail.

49:08.646 --> 49:09.981
You know what to do.

49:12.250 --> 49:14.119
- That's not really like her.

49:14.152 --> 49:15.420
Why don't we head
back to the car?

49:15.453 --> 49:17.355
Maybe she's waiting
for us there.

49:17.388 --> 49:18.456
- Okay.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.359
- Quinn!

49:21.392 --> 49:22.360
Come on.

49:22.393 --> 49:23.594
Let's go!

49:42.580 --> 49:45.383
[phone ringing quietly]

49:48.219 --> 49:51.022
[phone continues ringing
quietly]

49:52.390 --> 49:55.393
[phone ringing]

49:55.426 --> 49:56.794
- Hey, it's Gail.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.329
You know what to do.
[line beeps]

50:02.567 --> 50:06.071
- I couldn't have been running
longer than 30 minutes.

50:06.104 --> 50:08.306
- You girls didn't see anything,
see anyone else?

50:08.339 --> 50:10.241
- No.
Nothing.

50:10.275 --> 50:11.742
- You know, this beach is
usually pretty dead

50:11.776 --> 50:14.412
during the week, like today.

50:14.445 --> 50:17.115
- One of the girls pointed
towards Pirate Rock,

50:17.148 --> 50:19.184
said she saw her
walk there.

50:19.217 --> 50:22.253
- Gail's not a good swimmer.

50:22.287 --> 50:23.788
I think you need
to check the water.

50:26.657 --> 50:29.494
Please, please,
go check the water, please.

50:29.527 --> 50:31.762
- Requesting Coast Guard assist,
Pirate Rock. Over.

50:33.498 --> 50:36.367
- [sobbing]

50:42.773 --> 50:45.543
- All right.
The coastline is clear.

50:48.513 --> 50:49.680
- Sit tight.

50:52.550 --> 50:55.520
Check on the south beach too.

50:55.553 --> 50:57.122
- Sheriff, hurry!

50:57.155 --> 50:58.823
There's something
out by the water.

50:58.856 --> 51:00.591
- All right.
Hey, guys, we got her.

51:00.625 --> 51:01.659
- Oh, no, no.

51:01.692 --> 51:03.594
- Oh, Gail--
- No, no--

51:03.628 --> 51:05.096
[sobbing]

51:05.130 --> 51:08.233
- Everybody, down here now.

51:08.266 --> 51:10.268
All right.
Secure the perimeter.

51:10.301 --> 51:12.603
- Oh, no, no.
[sobbing]

51:12.637 --> 51:18.176
[indistinct police radio
chatter]

51:18.209 --> 51:21.078
[waves crashing]

51:50.441 --> 51:51.742
- I think that's it.

51:54.412 --> 51:55.613
- Thank you.

51:58.316 --> 52:02.253
I just can't believe she's gone.

52:02.287 --> 52:05.190
I keep thinking that she's just
gonna walk in the door

52:05.223 --> 52:07.792
any minute
all happy and cheery.

52:11.262 --> 52:13.498
Just--

52:13.531 --> 52:15.866
I can't imagine
what her family's going through.

52:17.535 --> 52:19.204
- Hey.

52:20.871 --> 52:23.140
This is a rough time
for you too.

52:27.212 --> 52:29.280
I'll just put this
in the garage.

52:31.416 --> 52:32.650
- Thank you.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.528
- I bet it's rough
on the girls too.

52:56.341 --> 52:59.810
First the trauma with
their mother, and now this.

53:05.950 --> 53:07.685
- She wanted to send us away,
Quinn.

53:07.718 --> 53:09.254
Didn't you hear her?

53:09.287 --> 53:10.421
- It's wrong.
This is all wrong.

53:10.455 --> 53:12.490
- What's wrong is Jen's will.

53:12.523 --> 53:13.958
That's wrong, Quinn.

53:13.991 --> 53:16.561
We need to go
see Mom right away.

53:16.594 --> 53:18.663
I need you with me
on this, Sissy.

53:18.696 --> 53:21.532
We need to be together.

53:21.566 --> 53:24.435
- You killed someone, Olivia.

53:24.469 --> 53:26.003
- My commitment is to you

53:26.036 --> 53:27.972
and Mom, Quinn.

53:28.005 --> 53:29.874
I'm committed
to saving our family.

53:29.907 --> 53:31.208
Are you?

53:38.883 --> 53:40.685
See, we're like this bee.

53:40.718 --> 53:43.488
One little bee
can't hurt me,

53:43.521 --> 53:44.922
but a swarm--

53:44.955 --> 53:47.792
[faint buzzing]

53:49.460 --> 53:52.330
[loud buzzing]

53:54.765 --> 53:57.702
[ominous music]

53:57.735 --> 54:02.973
*

54:05.576 --> 54:08.513
[delicate music]

54:08.546 --> 54:15.420
*

55:04.435 --> 55:05.570
- Girls?

55:05.603 --> 55:06.971
[knock at door]

55:17.782 --> 55:18.816
Girls?

55:27.758 --> 55:30.761
I think we probably
could've talked about this.

55:30.795 --> 55:32.563
If you guys feel like this is

55:32.597 --> 55:33.998
gonna make
the adjustment easier,

55:34.031 --> 55:37.435
then we can stick to one room
for right now.

55:37.468 --> 55:39.637
But we're gonna
talk about things, okay?

55:39.670 --> 55:41.338
No subject
is off-limits.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.810
- We want to see our mom.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.612
With everything that's
going on, Aunt Jen,

55:47.645 --> 55:48.746
we need to see her.

55:51.982 --> 55:53.818
- I will talk to Dr. Martine.

55:55.486 --> 55:56.487
Okay?

56:19.477 --> 56:21.712
- Here.
Let me show you our selfies.

56:21.746 --> 56:23.147
- Oh, yes.

56:23.180 --> 56:24.482
Show me everything.

56:36.727 --> 56:39.697
This shot would be
so much better if I was in it.

56:39.730 --> 56:40.931
Don't you think?

56:40.965 --> 56:42.533
- Yeah.

56:42.567 --> 56:43.901
Quinn and I
aren't in it either.

56:45.603 --> 56:47.872
- Although
this looks promising.

56:57.848 --> 57:00.651
I have
the game-changing word.

57:00.685 --> 57:02.453
- I know.

57:03.888 --> 57:06.056
- [laughs]

57:09.560 --> 57:10.995
It's a new game.

57:18.603 --> 57:19.870
Get it?

57:19.904 --> 57:21.639
- No.

57:21.672 --> 57:23.007
- Quinn, honey,
just watch Olivia.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.642
She knows what to do.

57:34.685 --> 57:36.487
- What was
all that about?

57:38.122 --> 57:39.757
- It means, dummy,

57:39.790 --> 57:41.992
that we need to
get adopted by Jen.

57:42.026 --> 57:43.861
- Adopted?

57:43.894 --> 57:45.796
But why do we want that?

57:45.830 --> 57:47.131
- So that we inherit everything.

57:47.164 --> 57:50.200
Get it?
You, me, and Mom.

57:52.069 --> 57:53.470
- Take care.
- Thank you.

57:58.676 --> 58:00.244
Okay.

58:00.277 --> 58:02.112
Well, did you guys
have a nice visit with your mom?

58:04.849 --> 58:06.884
- Hey, Jen?
- Yeah?

58:06.917 --> 58:08.786
- Thank you so much
for helping us.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.055
Quinn and I
really appreciate it.

58:11.088 --> 58:13.290
- Of course.

58:13.323 --> 58:16.226
You know you girls
mean the world to me.

58:16.260 --> 58:17.862
Come on.
Let's go home.

58:25.770 --> 58:28.973
- Aunt Jen, can we talk to you?

58:29.006 --> 58:30.808
It's been real hard,
Aunt Jen.

58:30.841 --> 58:33.077
CPS came to the house
six times--

58:33.110 --> 58:36.080
- Seven times, Quinn.

58:36.113 --> 58:37.715
Each time we would move,

58:37.748 --> 58:39.550
but it would just
happen again.

58:41.351 --> 58:45.322
- I am so glad you girls
are finally opening up to me.

58:45.355 --> 58:49.994
Look, I need you girls
to know your mom isn't bad.

58:50.027 --> 58:51.629
Okay?
She's sick.

58:51.662 --> 58:53.197
And she needs help.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.769
- We're afraid of her, Jen.

58:58.803 --> 59:00.871
Look, Mom's scary
when she gets crazy.

59:00.905 --> 59:03.240
Did you see our house?

59:03.273 --> 59:04.875
- I did.
Yeah.

59:04.909 --> 59:06.176
- You say that we're safe,

59:06.210 --> 59:08.245
but what happens
when she gets out?

59:08.278 --> 59:11.015
Are we supposed
to go back with her?

59:11.048 --> 59:14.084
- Are you really afraid?

59:14.118 --> 59:15.185
- [sniffles] Yeah.
We both are.

59:17.387 --> 59:19.023
We just can't go back to her.

59:21.325 --> 59:24.829
- What do you guys, um...

59:24.862 --> 59:26.964
what do you guys think
about coming here

59:26.997 --> 59:29.600
and living with me?

59:29.634 --> 59:31.769
- You can do that?

59:31.802 --> 59:33.237
- We can talk to your mom

59:33.270 --> 59:35.840
and try to
make her understand

59:35.873 --> 59:38.242
that we want to help her.

59:38.275 --> 59:39.977
You know, due to her
long-term treatment,

59:40.010 --> 59:41.912
it could be that a guardianship

59:41.946 --> 59:45.750
or even an adoption
could be an option.

59:47.184 --> 59:49.286
- An adoption?

59:49.319 --> 59:50.755
- Yeah, I mean,

59:50.788 --> 59:52.022
you guys and your mom
would have to agree,

59:52.056 --> 59:54.759
but yeah.

59:54.792 --> 59:56.961
- So well, what do you--
what do you mean?

59:56.994 --> 59:59.129
Like, what would that--
what would happen?

59:59.163 --> 01:00:04.669
- We would become
a new kind of family.

01:00:04.702 --> 01:00:07.772
We would have an open
and honest relationship,

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:10.941
and you would start school
in the fall.

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:15.112
For the first time
in a long time,

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:18.148
you guys would have a place
to call home.

01:00:18.182 --> 01:00:19.917
- [sniffles]

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.619
- What's mine would be yours.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:31.261
I mean, the attorney said
considering Cassie's history,

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:34.364
I have a real chance.

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:36.901
The girls even told me
that they're afraid of her.

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:39.904
They don't want
to go back to her.

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:42.239
The minute that a children's
court hears that,

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:44.108
they're gonna want to
push this through quickly.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.277
What?

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:52.249
Baby, come on.
What are you thinking?

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:55.119
- I don't know, Jen.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:58.155
It just seems that

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:00.958
they're too close. You know?

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.192
It's like they need--
- They're--

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:03.761
- It's like they need

01:01:03.794 --> 01:01:07.698
to be together to survive,
to breathe.

01:01:07.732 --> 01:01:12.169
Those two girls are never apart.

01:01:12.202 --> 01:01:13.971
And I know
you're the doctor here,

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:17.842
but I don't think that's healthy
for them or for you.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:19.176
- [sighs]

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.245
I worry about it too,
you know? And--

01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:26.350
- Look, I'm just gonna
go out and say it,

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:29.019
because I've been thinking
about this, and I'm--

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:30.287
- What?

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.924
- I'm wondering if adopting them

01:01:33.958 --> 01:01:36.093
is such a great idea.

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:38.462
- [sighs]

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:41.265
I know--I know
that they're troubled.

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:43.400
Okay?

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:44.401
But they've been better.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.272
Kevin, I mean,

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:50.775
those girls are my family.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:52.943
- I know.

01:01:52.977 --> 01:01:55.846
But I'm pretty sure they were
behind the glass in the lounger.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.216
I know they
stole from you.

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:01.051
You know that
they put acid

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:02.286
in your lotion,
for God's sakes.

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:03.520
What's next?

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.889
- I know
they've been acting out.

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:06.891
Okay?

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:09.493
But they're getting better.
They're happy, even.

01:02:09.526 --> 01:02:13.163
I mean, I have a real shot at
putting my family back together.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:17.334
- I know that's
really important to you.

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.369
- It is.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:23.874
- But something about them
doesn't feel right.

01:02:23.908 --> 01:02:26.210
And...

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:28.846
I think you should
reconsider the option

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:30.414
until everything's
ironed out.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.459
- Girls, I'm gonna head
to the store.

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.461
Do you need anything else?

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:46.063
- Don't forget pasta.
- Yeah.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.531
We're making dinner
tonight.

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:49.333
- Oh.

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:51.568
- Is Kevin still coming over?

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.237
- Yes. He's very excited.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.947
See you guys later.

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:23.968
- Come on, Quinn.

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:26.003
- Do we even know
where we're going?

01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:28.138
- Mom says this is
the best place to go.

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:30.107
- Go for what?

01:03:50.995 --> 01:03:52.262
[dog barks]

01:03:58.168 --> 01:03:59.169
- Hello.

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:00.470
- Good morning.

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:04.174
- Don't let
your sister eat those.

01:04:09.113 --> 01:04:11.481
Those are death caps.
They're poisonous.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:29.599
- What did she want?

01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:32.202
- Nothing.

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:38.475
[water bubbling]

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:41.478
[knife chopping]

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:44.448
[suspenseful music]

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:51.355
*

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:54.992
- Just keep
slicing your carrots

01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:56.526
and don't do
anything stupid.

01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:07.404
- Stop it.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.079
- What's wrong?

01:05:17.714 --> 01:05:19.583
You don't think
I'd hurt you, do you?

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.553
[timer buzzing, dings]

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:51.448
Good evening,
Ms. Burgess and Kevin.

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:52.616
- Mmm.

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.718
- [laughs]
both: Oh.

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:57.988
- Kevin gets the big plate,
because he's a big man.

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:02.326
- Wow.
This is a big helping.

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:04.461
- Girls,
this was very sweet.

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:07.331
Thank you.
It looks really good.

01:06:07.364 --> 01:06:09.133
- Just think.

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:11.101
Soon we'll be a family...

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:15.339
all of us.

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:16.606
You too, Kevin.

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:23.780
- Okay.
Cheers.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:24.981
- Bon appÃ©tit.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:37.427
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:38.695
- You know,

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:42.266
I didn't get
very many mushrooms.

01:06:42.299 --> 01:06:43.200
- You want some of mine?

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:44.268
- Yeah.

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.136
That would be great.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:48.038
Thank you.
- Have plenty.

01:06:48.072 --> 01:06:50.207
- Thank you.
Thank you.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.475
Q?

01:06:58.148 --> 01:06:59.183
- Quinn,

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:00.650
On't-day eat-ay.

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:04.688
On't-day ea-tay
ha-tay.

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:05.589
Quinn.

01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:09.126
Quinn.

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:10.660
Quinn, can I talk to you
for a second

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:11.628
in the other room?

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:14.698
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:21.105 --> 01:07:22.772
- Why did you do that?

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:24.441
- What do you--

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:25.742
- Quinn, you need
to go to the bathroom.

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:26.810
You need to make the mushrooms
come up now.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.578
Please, just do it.

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:30.614
- Why, Olivia?

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.082
You wanted to kill just Kevin?

01:07:32.116 --> 01:07:33.350
Is that it?

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:40.857
- So you knew the mushrooms
were poisonous.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.327
You switched them.
Quinn.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:48.098
Look, you think what you
did was right, but it's not.

01:07:48.132 --> 01:07:50.600
- And what you did
to Gail was right?

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:54.871
- He is putting the idea

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.574
of stopping the adoption
into Jen's head.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:59.776
He's going to mess this up.

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:03.247
I am looking out
for Mom and us.

01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:08.418
Quinn.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:57.167
- So happy to see you
up close.

01:08:57.201 --> 01:09:00.837
It's been so long.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.139
I missed you so much, Sis.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.926
Thank you for seeing me.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.395
I'm so happy you've been
so open to getting better

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:30.234
and just making
your life easier.

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:32.368
- Yeah.
Well, I tend to mess things up.

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:33.803
Don't I?

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:36.305
- Getting better--
that's all that matters.

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:45.682
I want to talk to you
about something,

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:48.518
something that's gonna
help you and the girls.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.319
- Well, I'm no mother
of the year,

01:09:50.354 --> 01:09:53.857
but I certainly want
what's best for my girls.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:56.660
Lately, it's dawned on me

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.263
[scoffs]

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:00.897
I'm not doing
such a bang-up job.

01:10:02.266 --> 01:10:03.367
- [chuckles]

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.472
This is gonna be
a sensitive subject,

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:10.006
and I want you
to just hear me out.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.775
Okay?

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:13.443
I've gone back and forth

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:15.612
in my mind so many times,

01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:18.348
and I've weighed--and
I've weighed all the options

01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:20.650
about what would be
the best thing

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:22.919
for you, for the girls,

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:26.656
and they're doing so well
with me, Cassie.

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:32.662
- They do seem better.

01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:34.230
- They really are.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.901
I'm wondering how you
would feel about

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:40.304
if they stayed
with me

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:42.539
permanently.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:45.675
I think it would be
a really good thing for you.

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:47.844
I think you could focus
on your healing.

01:10:47.877 --> 01:10:50.614
You could stop
worrying about them.

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:54.484
I actually spoke to the girls
about it already, and...

01:10:54.518 --> 01:10:57.421
you know,
they're such sweet girls.

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:59.956
They're really worried
about your feelings,

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:05.028
how you're gonna feel
about all of this.

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:06.830
But I think
it's what they want too.

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:17.474
You know, the legal--
the legal course of action,

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:19.909
I think, would be going through
with an adoption,

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.679
so I could--I could enroll them
in the school by my house,

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:26.015
and they would start
in the fall,

01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:27.351
and get them ready for college,

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:28.552
which I would be--

01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:30.754
I would be
so happy to pay for.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:38.628
Everything is, um--

01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:40.764
it's outlined here
in these papers.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:43.700
Take a look at it,
and see if you--

01:11:43.733 --> 01:11:48.438
- If I even consider this,
I want you to promise me

01:11:48.472 --> 01:11:51.541
I won't lose my girls forever.

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:54.744
- Cassie, I promise.

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:57.514
Nothing is forever.

01:11:57.547 --> 01:11:58.982
You are gonna finish
your treatment.

01:11:59.015 --> 01:12:00.484
You are gonna get back
on your feet,

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:02.652
and with a little time
behind you,

01:12:02.686 --> 01:12:05.054
you're gonna come back to us.
Okay?

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:08.592
You're gonna live with me
and the girls.

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:11.495
You are always gonna
be their mother.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:15.432
- You got that right.

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:22.472
But what I can't quit
thinking about is how--

01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:25.975
is how you think
you're saving my girls from me.

01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:29.446
It's how--

01:12:29.479 --> 01:12:32.882
how you think
you're saving my girls from me.

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:39.055
Jen, Jen, Jen,
Mommy's favorite.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:42.058
Little Jenny always
saves the day.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.026
- Cassie!

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:48.532
- [sighs]

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:50.734
Who am I kidding?

01:12:50.767 --> 01:12:54.538
I'm ruining their lives.

01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:57.574
They're better off with you.

01:12:57.607 --> 01:12:59.509
Even I know it.

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:06.850
I'll sign your papers.

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:27.070
- Hey.
So...

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:28.204
we're right
on schedule.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:29.673
We're the next
case up.

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:30.740
- Thanks.

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:54.864
- The judge is ready
to make a decision.

01:13:54.898 --> 01:13:56.600
He's encouraged by the paperwork
we've provided,

01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:58.735
and even more encouraging
is that Cassie

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.237
willingly signed
the adoption contract

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.706
and refused independent counsel.

01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:04.541
It's a really good sign.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:07.143
- I think Cassie's
in agreement that

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:10.113
this is the right thing
to do for the girls.

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:11.848
- Ms. Murphy,

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.783
the judge will want to
ask you a few questions.

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:16.786
- Sure.

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:20.123
- All rise.

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:27.764
- Please, be seated.

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.770
Ms. Cassandra Murphy,

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:36.740
you're the biological mother
of Olivia and Quinn Murphy,

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:38.207
twins, age 15.

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:41.678
- Yes, your honor.

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:43.146
- And Ms. Murphy,

01:14:43.179 --> 01:14:45.515
did you willingly sign
a contract relinquishing

01:14:45.549 --> 01:14:48.251
all parental rights to Olivia
and Quinn Murphy,

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:50.620
your biological daughters,

01:14:50.654 --> 01:14:52.822
to Ms. Burgess,
your biological sister,

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:54.958
to fully adopt
the aforementioned daughters?

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.526
- I did.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.666
- As a family court judge,

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:05.301
it is very important that
I am convinced a birth mother

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.770
is a willing participant

01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:08.672
when relinquishing
parental rights.

01:15:08.705 --> 01:15:10.206
Do you understand me,
Ms. Murphy?

01:15:15.879 --> 01:15:17.714
- Yeah.

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:19.215
Yeah, I get it.

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:21.317
So I can't even put
my kids up for adoption

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.987
without messing that up?

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.590
I'm crazy and completely
unfit to be a mother,

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:29.258
and she sits here,
perfect.

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:31.961
She gets everything
she wants.

01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:33.096
Everything!
- Bailiff--

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:34.330
- Let me go!

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.765
- Take her
out of my courtroom.

01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:37.100
- Yeah, I am
the perfect mother.

01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:39.268
- Bailiff, get her
out of my courtroom now.

01:15:39.302 --> 01:15:41.037
- I want my kids back.

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:42.672
I want my kids back.
I want them back.

01:15:42.706 --> 01:15:44.974
I want my babies back.
I'm the perfect mother.

01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:46.576
Let me go.

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:47.944
I want my babies back.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:49.278
I'm sorry.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:50.313
I'm sorry.

01:15:50.346 --> 01:15:51.715
I'm sorry!

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:04.060
[plaintive music]

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:10.967
*

01:16:23.647 --> 01:16:26.349
- So the judge
is granting the adoption.

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:31.888
See, after the violent outburst,
he felt it better for the girls.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:36.726
So congratulations, all of you.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.662
I hope this is
a healing time for you all.

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:40.930
I wish you all of the best.

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:00.116
- I love you, Sis.

01:17:05.922 --> 01:17:07.623
Okay.
Let's go.

01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:23.272
Well, it's official.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:26.109
Girls, I just have to tell you
I'm so happy--

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:29.879
happy for our futures,
and I'm happy for your mom too.

01:17:29.913 --> 01:17:33.282
I just--I love you both so much.

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:35.819
- We're happy too.

01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:37.687
- We're gonna be a great family.

01:17:55.471 --> 01:17:58.241
I have some good news
for you girls.

01:17:58.274 --> 01:18:03.847
Your mother's doctor approved
her for a free day tomorrow.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.985
So tomorrow, we are gonna
all go on a picnic together.

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:11.054
What do you guys
think about that?

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:12.856
- Cool.

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:14.357
Where are we going?

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:16.459
- There is a great little
mountain location

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:18.227
that your great-grandfather

01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:20.997
used to take your mom and I
to when we were kids.

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.899
It's really beautiful.

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:30.740
- Olivia, come on.
We have to go and get Mom.

01:18:41.918 --> 01:18:43.186
What are you doing?

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:45.822
- Stay out of it.

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:47.056
- You and Mom
are up to something.

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.257
I know it.

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:51.294
Please, tell me.

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:52.261
What is it?

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:56.432
Who's that for?

01:18:56.465 --> 01:19:00.937
- Something for Mom from me.

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:02.772
- Okay.
Just you.

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:07.777
What is it?

01:19:07.811 --> 01:19:09.512
- I can't trust you.

01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:22.125
[loud buzzing]

01:19:30.867 --> 01:19:32.035
- Okay.

01:19:32.068 --> 01:19:33.169
You guys, we're gonna be late.

01:19:33.202 --> 01:19:34.203
Where's your sister?

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:36.539
Quinn?

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:56.325
[portentous music]

01:19:56.359 --> 01:20:03.199

01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:34.964
[eagle cries]

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:42.505
[mysterious music]

01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:48.011
*

01:20:48.044 --> 01:20:49.979
- Girls, your grandfather
used to take

01:20:50.013 --> 01:20:52.181
your mom and I
up this same road,

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:54.483
except for we would drive in
the back of his pick-up truck.

01:20:54.517 --> 01:20:56.219
Mom used to come with us
too sometimes.

01:20:56.252 --> 01:20:57.286
Right?

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.888
- Maybe.

01:20:58.922 --> 01:21:00.256
She had better things to do,

01:21:00.289 --> 01:21:03.559
usually with someone
named Rocko or Bud.

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:05.294
- She wasn't all that bad.

01:21:05.328 --> 01:21:06.562
- Easy for you to say.

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:08.064
She was a lot nicer to you.

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:09.032
- Mom, I got you something.

01:21:09.065 --> 01:21:10.033
- Can't you wait?

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:13.369
- You know, we don't
have to talk about this.

01:21:13.402 --> 01:21:15.204
We can--we could talk about
something else.

01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:17.306
- No, no.
It's okay.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:18.607
I can talk about it all.

01:21:18.641 --> 01:21:20.476
I'm telling you, Jen.

01:21:20.509 --> 01:21:23.146
I can see clearly now.

01:21:23.179 --> 01:21:25.982
It dawned on me
just the other day

01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:29.318
how much Mom came between us.

01:21:29.352 --> 01:21:31.054
- She was troubled.
She was unstable.

01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:32.621
- Unstable?

01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:34.223
[laughs]

01:21:34.257 --> 01:21:37.293
Mom was crazy
as a jaybird.

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:39.328
Come on.
You can admit it.

01:21:39.362 --> 01:21:45.001
Jen Burgess, great radio shrink,
had a crazy mom.

01:21:45.034 --> 01:21:46.435
[laughs]
- You know what, girls?

01:21:46.469 --> 01:21:48.071
It's a long way
to the top of the mountain.

01:21:48.104 --> 01:21:49.538
Does anyone need
a bathroom break?

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:50.639
- You girls can hold it.
Right?

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:52.008
- We're fine.

01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:53.576
Do you want to open
your gift now?

01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:56.579
- No, hon.
Let's save it.

01:21:56.612 --> 01:21:57.680
Let's just
enjoy the view.

01:22:18.734 --> 01:22:20.736
Are you okay, sweetie?

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.171
- Yeah.

01:22:22.205 --> 01:22:23.172
- [laughs]

01:22:23.206 --> 01:22:24.707
- Cass--

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.409
- What's it like, Jen,

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.711
to get everything
you want?

01:22:28.744 --> 01:22:30.679
Because you do, right?

01:22:30.713 --> 01:22:33.516
[laughs]
You got me locked up.

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:36.185
You adopted
both of my girls.

01:22:36.219 --> 01:22:37.653
I'm just curious what's next.

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.222
- All right.
- I know what you think is next.

01:22:39.255 --> 01:22:41.290
- Okay, Cassie--

01:22:41.324 --> 01:22:43.993
- You think you're in control
of everything, don't you?

01:22:44.027 --> 01:22:45.394
- Okay. We're done.
You know what?

01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:46.762
I think we should just go back.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.731
- [laughs]
No, no.

01:22:48.764 --> 01:22:52.501
Seriously,
this is therapeutic for me.

01:22:52.535 --> 01:22:55.371
In fact, I think I'm about
to feel so much better.

01:22:55.404 --> 01:22:56.572
- You know what?
We're gonna go--

01:22:56.605 --> 01:22:59.342
- Olivia, let me
have that present.

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:01.144
- We are just gonna
do this another day. Okay?

01:23:01.177 --> 01:23:03.512
- Thanks, sweetie.
No, no, no, no.

01:23:03.546 --> 01:23:04.580
This is the perfect gift...

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:06.449
- What is that?
- [laughing]

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:10.053
- For the perfect family.

01:23:10.086 --> 01:23:11.387
- Olivia, what is that?

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:13.589
- You're gonna love it.
[laughter]

01:23:13.622 --> 01:23:15.758
- What are you doing?

01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:18.361
- [laughing]
- Cassie, what are you doing?

01:23:18.394 --> 01:23:21.197
- [laughing]

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:23.766
- [gasps] Surprise.

01:23:23.799 --> 01:23:25.268

01:23:25.301 --> 01:23:27.570
[both screaming]

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:29.305
- No!
Cassie!

[tires squeal]

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.242

01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:41.717
- [laughs]

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.086
Get it.
Whoo!

01:23:43.119 --> 01:23:45.188
[loud buzzing]

01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.090
Oh, they got you.

01:23:47.123 --> 01:23:49.325
They got you, didn't they?
[laughs]

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:51.194
Oh, are they in your hair?

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:53.696
Oh, yeah.
Oh, oh--

01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:56.232
- Cassie, you know I'll die--

01:23:56.265 --> 01:23:57.600
- What?

01:23:57.633 --> 01:23:59.602
She deserves it,
Quinn.

01:23:59.635 --> 01:24:00.703
She left us alone.

01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:02.838
She's ashamed of her own family.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:07.576
Well, you're not looking
so pretty now, are you, Sissy?

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:10.479
No. You're looking
kind of heinous.

01:24:10.513 --> 01:24:12.648
Isn't it funny, Jen?

01:24:12.681 --> 01:24:16.452
You won every damn time.

01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:18.421
Well, look at me.

01:24:18.454 --> 01:24:21.624
I get to live with my babies

01:24:21.657 --> 01:24:25.094
in your fancy house

01:24:25.128 --> 01:24:28.464
without you there
to judge me.

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:30.566
I won the big one.

01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:32.468
I won the big one!

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:34.737
Whoo!

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:37.173
I won the big one!

01:24:37.206 --> 01:24:38.307
Hoo-hoo!
[laughs]

01:24:38.341 --> 01:24:39.775
- Let's go.

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.377

- [laughing]

01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:45.581
- Our lives are gonna change.

01:24:50.553 --> 01:24:51.754
Whoo!

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:52.821

01:26:16.305 --> 01:26:17.673
- What, Quinn?

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:19.608
What, Quinn?
What is wrong?

01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:21.910
- She's just mad because
we kept her out of our plan.

01:26:23.979 --> 01:26:25.781
- You think you don't need me,

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:28.384
that I don't matter
to either of you.

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:29.818
- No, honey.
We don't think that.

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:30.853
- You do!

01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:32.621
You always have.

01:26:32.655 --> 01:26:34.957
You're more Mom's twin
than mine, Olivia.

01:26:37.793 --> 01:26:39.662
It doesn't matter.
It's too late.

01:26:39.695 --> 01:26:41.697
- What's too late?

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:45.668
What's too late, Quinn?

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:47.370
What did you do, Quinn?

01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:48.604
- Stop it, you two.

[tires squeal]

01:26:50.439 --> 01:26:52.007
- She did something!

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.576
[screaming indistinctly]
- Stop it.

01:26:53.609 --> 01:26:57.012
[tires squealing]

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.647
- No!

01:26:58.681 --> 01:26:59.948
- You're going to ruin it!
- Stop it.

01:26:59.982 --> 01:27:02.751
- She did something!
- Stop it.

01:27:02.785 --> 01:27:03.952
Olivia, sit down.

Stop it.

Olivia, wake up!

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:47.630
- You have to
get out of the car.

01:27:47.663 --> 01:27:48.697
- No, no!
- Come on.

01:27:48.731 --> 01:27:50.333
I'm gonna come back for her,

01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:52.368
but you've got
to get away from the car.

01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:54.503
Olivia?

01:27:54.537 --> 01:27:55.638
Honey?

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.907
Come on, you've got to
get out of the car.

01:28:04.813 --> 01:28:06.682
It's gonna be okay.

01:28:06.715 --> 01:28:08.050
[grunts]

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:11.420
Olivia?

01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:12.955
Olivia, can you hear me?

01:28:12.988 --> 01:28:15.057
Olivia?
Olivia?

01:28:18.527 --> 01:28:21.497
[somber music]

01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:28.404
*

01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:08.544
- Quinn has progressed
dramatically

01:29:08.577 --> 01:29:09.545
since she's been here.

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:11.747
She has really blossomed

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:13.582
and has come to realize
that you and Kevin

01:29:13.616 --> 01:29:16.118
are the only really
healthy people in her life.

01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:20.789
Now, Olivia, as you know,
is another matter.

01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:24.927
[plaintive music]

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:31.834
*

01:29:40.008 --> 01:29:41.810
Her disturbance
is severe

01:29:41.844 --> 01:29:43.111
and deep.

01:29:43.145 --> 01:29:44.547
Now, criminally,

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.615
she may have benefited
for being a minor.

01:29:46.649 --> 01:29:48.751
But she still faces
years of treatment,

01:29:48.784 --> 01:29:51.086
as she remains
resistant and hostile.

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:54.056
[plaintive music]

01:29:54.089 --> 01:30:01.497
*

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:04.467
[hopeful music]

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:11.173
*

01:30:19.548 --> 01:30:22.485
[ominous music]

01:30:22.518 --> 01:30:29.157
*

01:30:40.536 --> 01:30:42.037
Quinn!

01:30:43.639 --> 01:30:45.207
Quinn!

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.176
[sobs loudly]
Quinn!

01:30:48.210 --> 01:30:50.579
No!
Quinn!

01:30:52.014 --> 01:30:54.249
No!
Quinn!

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:58.521
[screaming indistinctly]
No!

01:30:58.554 --> 01:31:00.022
No!

01:31:00.055 --> 01:31:02.991
[somber music]

01:31:03.025 --> 01:31:09.865
*

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:24.146
[both sobbing]

01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:32.154
- Well, that's all the time
we have for today.

01:31:32.187 --> 01:31:34.857
This is Dr. Jen,
and thank you for listening.

01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:36.959
Remember, you create the love
you deserve.

01:31:38.861 --> 01:31:41.797
[mysterious music]

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:48.704
