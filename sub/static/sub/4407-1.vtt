02:13.210 --> 02:16.628
? Mon ami Pierrot

02:16.715 --> 02:18.424
? Prête-moi ta plume

02:18.510 --> 02:20.550
? Pour écrire un mot

02:20.638 --> 02:22.680
? Ma chandelle est morte

02:22.767 --> 02:24.808
? Je n'ai plus de feu

02:24.895 --> 02:26.937
? Ouvre-moi ta porte

02:27.025 --> 02:29.066
? Pour l'amour de Dieu

02:29.154 --> 02:31.194
? Ma chandelle est morte

02:31.282 --> 02:33.322
? Je n'ai plus de feu

02:33.409 --> 02:35.451
? Ouvre-moi ta porte

02:35.538 --> 02:37.579
? Pour l'amour de Dieu

02:42.341 --> 02:46.127
? Au jardin de mon pére
les lauriers sont fleuris

02:46.890 --> 02:50.391
? Au jardin de mon pére
les lauriers sont fleuris

02:53.359 --> 02:55.733
- Bonsoir, monsieur.
- Bonsoir, madame.

02:55.821 --> 02:57.650
Combien coûte le cidre là-bas?

02:57.742 --> 02:59.783
- Ça, cidre?
- Oui, oui.

02:59.871 --> 03:03.787
- Cinq francs.
- Oh, c'est trop cher. Bonsoir, monsieur.

03:03.877 --> 03:05.337
Bonsoir, madame.

03:08.426 --> 03:10.169
? Auprés de ma blonde

03:10.261 --> 03:12.670
? Qu'il fait bon fait bon fait bon

03:12.764 --> 03:15.221
? Auprés de ma blonde

03:19.778 --> 03:21.570
Enfin, ma belle.

03:22.699 --> 03:25.702
Let go of me! How dare you, you brutes!
Let go of me.

03:25.787 --> 03:27.497
You didn't get away this time, huh?

03:27.583 --> 03:31.285
- She's English.
- What's she doing here?

03:31.380 --> 03:34.833
- Stealing.
- It's a lie! Keep your dirty hands off me!

03:34.927 --> 03:37.301
How dare you touch me!

03:37.390 --> 03:41.390
I can buy thousands of bottles of your filthy wine.
I'll show you who I am.

03:41.480 --> 03:45.267
Ah, I didn't recognise you. Forgive me, my lady.

03:45.362 --> 03:47.271
My lady is right, you pig.

03:47.364 --> 03:48.775
Qu'est-ce que vous...

04:10.110 --> 04:12.020
Here, dearie, it'll do you good.

04:20.043 --> 04:22.084
Thank you, dear.

04:22.171 --> 04:23.998
You've all been very kind.

04:25.134 --> 04:27.009
I didn't mean to get you into trouble.

04:27.095 --> 04:28.923
No trouble at all.

04:29.015 --> 04:32.434
I always wanted to kick that swine in the pants,
anyhow. I'm glad I done it.

04:32.521 --> 04:34.599
I'm English, too.

04:34.692 --> 04:38.443
My name's Smith - Mary Smith.
What's yours, dearie?

04:38.531 --> 04:40.572
- Emma.
- Emma.

04:40.660 --> 04:44.196
I knew a girl whose name was Emma.
Emily Burrows.

04:44.290 --> 04:46.331
What's yours?

04:46.418 --> 04:48.460
My name?

04:48.548 --> 04:51.005
My name is Emma Lady Hamilton.

04:52.471 --> 04:54.513
Oh...

04:54.600 --> 04:56.641
That's one on me.

04:56.729 --> 04:59.482
It serves me right. I shouldn't be so nosy.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.438
Well, darlin',
if you don't want to tell me your name,

05:02.529 --> 05:05.734
I'd be the last one to poke my nose
in anybody's secrets.

05:05.826 --> 05:12.034
I remember my mother telling me Lady Hamilton
was the most beautiful woman in the world.

05:13.964 --> 05:15.792
Have you got a mirror?

05:15.884 --> 05:17.462
Yes.

05:18.972 --> 05:20.764
Better you didn't, dearie.

05:22.018 --> 05:23.597
Oh, well.

05:27.780 --> 05:29.358
I know it.

05:29.449 --> 05:31.490
I know that face.

05:31.578 --> 05:35.115
For ten years it has looked back at me
from different mirrors.

05:36.376 --> 05:38.204
It must be me.

05:39.339 --> 05:44.549
But I always wait for the miracle,
that one time, just once more,

05:44.638 --> 05:47.511
when it will be another face
that looks at me again.

05:47.602 --> 05:50.309
A face I knew before.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.312
But that face must be dead.

05:57.035 --> 05:59.409
Go on, tell us all about it.

05:59.497 --> 06:01.990
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.

06:02.085 --> 06:04.126
True or not.

06:05.257 --> 06:07.298
I don't know it myself.

06:07.385 --> 06:11.219
It's so long ago, I don't know it anymore.

06:15.565 --> 06:18.901
My life really began when I was 18

06:21.783 --> 06:23.613
I was beautiful then

06:23.705 --> 06:25.745
Coach from London!

06:25.833 --> 06:28.954
One day I arrived in Naples

06:30.924 --> 06:35.387
At the palace of His Excellency
the British Ambassador

06:35.472 --> 06:37.015
How's London, Gavin?

06:37.100 --> 06:41.018
- How's my nephew? Did he send everything?
- It's all here, Your Excellency.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.821
Give me a hand with this chisel!

06:45.907 --> 06:49.609
- Mr Greville sends his regards.
- Don't bother me about Mr Greville now!

06:49.704 --> 06:53.704
- Give me a hammer and chisel.
- It's most important, sir.

07:05.815 --> 07:07.144
Exquisite.

07:07.234 --> 07:09.274
Come and look at this.

07:13.159 --> 07:16.364
- Enchanting. Whose work is it?
- George Romney.

07:16.456 --> 07:19.128
If he could paint reality, he would be a master.

07:19.211 --> 07:21.253
Isn't that reality?

07:21.340 --> 07:24.177
The ideal an artist dreams of.

07:24.262 --> 07:28.260
No woman ever lived with such colouring,
such god-like simplicity.

07:28.350 --> 07:30.391
I thought so too till I met her.

07:30.478 --> 07:31.891
You've met her?

07:31.982 --> 07:36.113
In London, last year. And if you're patient,
you may see her in Naples one day.

07:36.197 --> 07:39.366
- Your Excellency.
- Oh, not now, Gavin. I'll see you presently.

07:39.452 --> 07:41.493
But I must tell you.

07:41.580 --> 07:44.252
Very well, if you must, but tell me quickly.

07:53.935 --> 07:58.684
Mum? Mum? Look, it's lovely.

07:58.777 --> 08:00.652
It's a real palace.

08:00.738 --> 08:02.447
Oh, I do hope Sir William will like us.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.775
Don't worry, darling. Of course he'll like you.

08:04.869 --> 08:08.571
I'll do all the talking. Charlie told me exactly what
to answer to everything.

08:08.666 --> 08:11.834
Why on earth didn't you tell me?
Where are they?

08:11.921 --> 08:13.832
Sshh. Here he comes.

08:15.177 --> 08:17.420
You must forgive me. It's disgraceful.

08:17.514 --> 08:19.722
I'd no idea you'd come.

08:19.810 --> 08:23.098
- How do you do, Miss er...
- Emma Hart, if it pleases Your Excellency.

08:23.191 --> 08:25.980
- How could I forget?
- This is my mother, Your Excellency.

08:26.070 --> 08:30.783
Welcome to Naples, madam.
This is my friend the French Ambassador.

08:30.870 --> 08:31.987
Did you stay in Rome?

08:32.082 --> 08:34.788
Yes, Your Excellency
and thought it very beautiful.

08:34.876 --> 08:38.711
We saw the Colosseum by moonlight
and were deeply impressed by the Vatican.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.876
We just missed the Pope by ten minutes.

08:40.969 --> 08:42.594
That was a great pity, madam.

08:42.679 --> 08:45.682
Did you come through Pisa?
Did you see the famous leaning tower?

08:45.768 --> 08:48.476
Yes, Your Excellency,
and we thought it very beautiful.

08:48.566 --> 08:51.522
We thought the leaning tower of Pisa
one of the most remarkable

08:51.613 --> 08:53.690
and lovely phenomena in the whole of Europe.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.988
A chimney went like that in Liverpool last year
at the soap works.

08:57.080 --> 09:01.127
It leant right over the gin warehouse and
the Bishop said it was the finger of God.

09:01.211 --> 09:04.712
Charles - Mr Greville - sent you
many kind wishes, Your Excellency.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.043
And he hopes I will prove worthy
of your kindness

09:07.137 --> 09:10.640
and speak good French and Italian when
he comes to take me home in October.

09:10.727 --> 09:12.971
He is coming the first week in October.

09:13.065 --> 09:18.026
And er... he sent his uncle... a kiss.

09:20.118 --> 09:23.619
Well, that's the first present I've ever received
from Charles Greville.

09:23.706 --> 09:26.876
I feel sure you must be tired after your journey,
madam.

09:26.962 --> 09:29.585
Francis, show the ladies their rooms.

09:34.056 --> 09:37.059
Au revoir, madam. Au revoir, Miss Hart.

09:40.776 --> 09:43.233
- Who is she?
- Charles Greville found her.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.197
Where can you find things like that?

09:45.284 --> 09:48.738
Charles happened to find her
at Featherstone Castle - Sir Harry's place.

09:48.832 --> 09:51.620
- Oh, she's a relation of Sir Harry?
- You might call her that.

09:51.711 --> 09:55.877
She lived there for a whole hunting season
and a very gay hunting season it was, I'm told.

09:55.968 --> 09:58.638
Oh. And where did Sir Harry find her?

09:58.722 --> 10:02.769
Well, you remember Dr Graham's Temple of Hell
and the famous dance of the seven veils?

10:02.853 --> 10:05.312
- She's a dancer?
- You might call her that.

10:05.401 --> 10:09.400
She was quite a success.
The fewer the veils the greater the success.

10:09.490 --> 10:13.537
But, alas, the police locked the place
just after the last veil fell.

10:13.621 --> 10:16.541
The older I get,
the less I seem to know about women.

10:16.627 --> 10:19.499
It's the penalty of your wicked youth,
Your Excellency.

10:19.590 --> 10:21.917
Don't ask me what happened to her before.

10:22.011 --> 10:24.052
The usual past, I suppose.

10:24.139 --> 10:27.640
A poor little country girl wronged once
and then wronged again.

10:27.728 --> 10:32.439
The old story.
Lower and lower, but always up and up.

10:32.527 --> 10:34.734
And now she's the guest of an ambassador.

10:34.822 --> 10:36.614
With a past like that.

10:37.743 --> 10:39.156
Past?

10:39.246 --> 10:43.294
Look at this statue.
Two hundred years in a Greek temple.

10:43.379 --> 10:46.466
Then thrown into the mud
by some barbarian soldier.

10:46.551 --> 10:51.429
2,000 years sinking lower and lower into the
mud, then dug up by the plough of a peasant,

10:51.517 --> 10:56.977
changing hands every year until at last
it comes to its rightful place.

10:57.068 --> 11:00.903
Into the hands of someone
who understands the glory of its beauty.

11:00.992 --> 11:07.448
Because, my friend, it is still beautiful, isn't it,
despite its past?

11:07.543 --> 11:08.705
Gavin.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.704
I'll dine tonight with Miss Hart

11:10.797 --> 11:12.791
Alone, at eight o'clock.

11:12.884 --> 11:14.593
GAVlN: Yes Your Excellency

11:14.678 --> 11:17.932
Thank you, my man.
I'll ring for you later, if I want you.

11:18.018 --> 11:20.060
Very good, madam.

11:22.319 --> 11:24.359
Two ambassadors, Mum, two!

11:24.447 --> 11:27.402
Well, what did you think of me?
Wasn't I wonderful?

11:27.535 --> 11:29.244
You were all that, darling, and more.

11:30.373 --> 11:31.998
So far, so good.

11:32.083 --> 11:36.499
But, please, Mum, not another word about the
soap factory. Not till I've married Charlie.

11:36.591 --> 11:39.843
Charlie said Sir William was very fussy
about that sort of thing.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.303
Don't worry your pretty head
about Sir William.

11:42.392 --> 11:45.264
You'll have him eating out of your hand
within three months.

11:45.355 --> 11:48.773
Three months? Three days?
He'll be eating out of it tonight.

11:48.861 --> 11:50.605
And in a month,

11:50.697 --> 11:52.987
Charlie will be here to take us home.

11:53.076 --> 11:55.236
How pleased he'll be with me.

11:55.330 --> 11:57.454
He will indeed, but there's no great hurry.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.580
It's very nice here just now
and it's not costing us a farthing.

12:00.671 --> 12:05.003
It's all very well for you, but what about me?
''Yes, Your Excellency. No, Your Excellency.

12:05.095 --> 12:06.970
Of course, Your Excellency.''

12:07.057 --> 12:10.060
- Oh, how I miss my Charlie.
- Yes, he's a likely, young fellow.

12:10.145 --> 12:14.017
Burt there's no-one good enough for my Emily,
though it's her own mother who says so.

12:14.112 --> 12:18.575
But, Mother, I wouldn't exist without Charlie.
He's done everything for me, everything.

12:18.661 --> 12:20.702
Well, he's... made me a lady.

12:20.789 --> 12:22.580
I know, darling, I know.

12:22.666 --> 12:25.585
Oh! Look at that mountain
with the smoke coming out of it.

12:25.671 --> 12:28.958
The coachman said it went off a few years ago
and killed several people.

12:29.051 --> 12:30.795
That would never happen in Liverpool.

12:30.887 --> 12:34.840
Oh, Mother, you're hopeless. That's a famous
volcano. People come miles to see it.

12:34.936 --> 12:37.607
What do they call it? Charles told me 100 times.

12:37.774 --> 12:41.026
Smoking mountain. Vesuvius, that's it, Vesuvius.

12:41.113 --> 12:44.282
If Sir William asks you what you think
of it, just say it's lovely.

12:44.369 --> 12:47.537
- Yes, dear.
- It's mixed up with the history of Ancient Rome.

12:47.623 --> 12:50.414
Nero set it on fire and said the Christians did it.

12:50.505 --> 12:55.383
Remember, Mother, it's knowing little things
like that that makes you a lady.

13:29.109 --> 13:33.239
Whenever I have a nice piece of fish,
it always makes me think of the sea.

13:33.324 --> 13:35.235
- The what?
- The sea Your Excellency

13:35.328 --> 13:36.442
Oh, yes.

13:36.537 --> 13:39.208
Charles was wonderful about things like that.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.416
- About fish?
- Oh!

13:41.504 --> 13:43.581
You're so funny, Your Excellency.

13:43.674 --> 13:47.092
Every time you call me ''Your Excellency'',
it adds one year to my life.

13:47.180 --> 13:49.387
- Sir William?
- That's getting better

13:49.475 --> 13:53.690
Tell me, my dear.
Was my nephew so positive about coming here?

13:53.774 --> 13:58.237
Oh, absolutely. He would have brought me here
himself, if he hadn't been detained in London.

13:58.323 --> 14:00.613
Just a second, my dear.

14:00.701 --> 14:03.110
As we're to live together under the same roof

14:03.206 --> 14:07.372
I see no reason why we should not
be perfectly frank with one another

14:12.888 --> 14:18.183
As much as I hate to spoil this beautiful picture
that you have drawn for yourseIf of my nephew,

14:18.273 --> 14:21.145
there's one point that must be made quite clear.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.239
Charles Greville will never come to Naples

14:25.451 --> 14:30.412
But, Your Excellency, Uncle,
he definitely promised.

14:30.501 --> 14:34.880
There is a wide gap between my nephew's
promises and his fulfilment of them

14:34.966 --> 14:38.052
The promise he gave me, he will keep.

14:39.264 --> 14:42.352
Your confidence in him is really touching.

14:44.024 --> 14:45.934
Did he promise you marriage as well?

14:47.070 --> 14:50.357
Why deny it? It must be written all over me.

14:50.449 --> 14:53.867
I'm afraid I've got to destroy
those sweet dreams of yours.

14:53.955 --> 14:57.789
My nephew never had the slightest intention
of marrying you.

14:57.877 --> 15:01.047
Either with my consent or without it.

15:03.847 --> 15:06.256
What did you say, Your Excellency?

15:07.686 --> 15:11.522
I said he's not going to marry you, Emma.

15:14.573 --> 15:16.567
But that's not possible.

15:17.746 --> 15:20.072
Why should he send me here with my mother?

15:20.166 --> 15:22.207
It costs a lot of money, the journey.

15:22.294 --> 15:26.922
Perhaps he feIt you would be better off
with his uncle. A nice vacation.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.049
But I didn't need a vacation.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.590
No. No, there must be something else.

15:33.686 --> 15:37.058
And what's to happen after the vacation,
if he doesn't want to marry me?

15:37.151 --> 15:40.689
He's talked of nothing else for years.
It was his idea. I never urged him.

15:40.783 --> 15:43.026
I was quite happy with him just as it was.

15:44.997 --> 15:48.915
Tell me, Your Excellency,
but please tell me the truth.

15:50.048 --> 15:52.374
Did Charles tell you about me?

15:52.468 --> 15:54.510
Do you know about my

15:54.597 --> 15:59.060
He did. And I imagine that was the only thing
he did not lie about.

16:03.653 --> 16:06.572
Oh but please my dear,
I don't want to make you feel ashamed.

16:06.657 --> 16:10.705
Ashamed? Oh, I'm not ashamed.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

16:10.789 --> 16:14.375
It's true there were men in my life
before Charles, I admit it.

16:14.463 --> 16:16.836
I made mistakes, I was young, I was stupid.

16:16.925 --> 16:19.049
I believed in men and their promises.

16:19.136 --> 16:21.807
Charles knew about me
before he took me into the house,

16:21.891 --> 16:23.599
before he promised to marry me.

16:23.685 --> 16:27.520
And now I'm different, not only my clothes,
but inside.

16:27.609 --> 16:30.102
I'm good. I know I'm good.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.238
So why should he lie to me?

16:32.326 --> 16:35.245
Why did he send me here?
What am I doing here?

16:35.331 --> 16:37.705
Charles had a lot of debts. Did you know that?

16:37.794 --> 16:39.621
Yes, quite a lot, I know.

16:39.713 --> 16:43.213
His debts have been paid to the tune of £5,000.

16:43.301 --> 16:47.846
Besides he has plenty of cash
to save him from new debts for a long time

16:53.694 --> 16:55.521
Oh, I see.

16:57.408 --> 16:59.448
see

17:00.162 --> 17:08.424
He sold you antiques, paintings, and among
the bric-a-brac, a certain Emma Hart.

17:10.262 --> 17:13.930
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't gentlemanlike.

17:14.019 --> 17:17.556
He shouldn't have raised me up
just to throw me down again.

17:17.650 --> 17:18.895
My dear.

17:18.984 --> 17:20.859
Leave me alone. You're just as bad as he is.

17:20.945 --> 17:23.949
Perhaps you haven't made
such a good bargain after all.

17:24.034 --> 17:25.445
I'm not going to stay here.

17:25.537 --> 17:28.112
I'm going away now. Now!

17:36.764 --> 17:38.674
Oh, don't take it to heart, my dear.

17:38.767 --> 17:42.139
Forget Charles, forget the old memories,
forget London.

17:42.231 --> 17:45.235
I can offer you a new life
and a far more exciting one.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.361
Naples is a wonderful city.

17:47.449 --> 17:50.285
You'll be a success here. You'll like it.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.408
Perhaps not today, nor even tomorrow.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.703
But you are young and the young heal quickly.

18:02.597 --> 18:06.183
You will learn singing and music
under the greatest masters in Italy.

18:06.271 --> 18:09.524
You will speak French and Italian
with our finest teachers.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.862
Everyone of account in Europe comes to my
house. You will meet them all.

18:12.949 --> 18:16.117
You will dine with famous soldiers,
artists and statesmen.

18:16.204 --> 18:20.915
You can't be presented at court, of course,
but you will have a villa by the sea and a coach.

18:21.003 --> 18:23.460
You will have your private box at the opera.

18:23.549 --> 18:27.169
Ever since I first saw you in London,
I feIt this house of mine to be empty,

18:27.263 --> 18:30.016
missing its greatest and most lovely ornament.

18:30.101 --> 18:32.259
You will be that ornament, my dear.

18:32.353 --> 18:35.227
And except for that absurd presentation at court,

18:35.318 --> 18:39.365
you will have everything in life
that a woman could possibly dream of.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.247
What did you say?

18:43.332 --> 18:45.160
Nothing. Try to sleep.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.295
Goodnight, Emma.

18:55.225 --> 18:57.897
MOTHER: What's wrong, darling?

18:57.980 --> 18:59.393
Oh, mum!

18:59.483 --> 19:01.524
Dear, dear.

19:01.612 --> 19:03.653
Mum, I'm so miserable.

19:05.368 --> 19:07.942
- What's wrong?
- He never wanted to marry me.

19:08.038 --> 19:13.248
He got £5,000 from the old man
to send me here.

19:14.339 --> 19:16.463
He never wanted to marry me.

19:16.551 --> 19:19.923
Don't cry, my sweet.
You're too good for any of them.

19:20.016 --> 19:21.427
I'm going to pack now.

19:21.518 --> 19:26.765
We'll go right back to London and you can give
that precious Mr Greville a piece of your mind.

19:26.861 --> 19:31.442
Plenty of good men want to marry my Emily.
There, now, darling. Don't cry.

19:31.535 --> 19:34.823
There's just as good fish in the sea
as ever came out of it.

19:34.916 --> 19:37.873
Darling, precious Emily, there, now.

19:40.759 --> 19:43.512
And I forgot London
and the old memories.

19:43.597 --> 19:46.967
I was young I healed quickly.

19:47.978 --> 19:51.396
I learnt French, Italian, singing, and music.

19:52.485 --> 19:55.738
One day I had more than I ever dreamed of.

19:55.825 --> 19:59.492
I became his wife - Emma Lady Hamilton.

20:17.194 --> 20:19.484
Sshh!

20:19.573 --> 20:22.111
My daughter, Her Ladyship, is still asleep.

20:22.201 --> 20:24.195
- Good morning, Contessa.
- Good morning.

20:24.287 --> 20:28.750
My daughter, Her Ladyship, is still resting.
Perhaps you wouldn't mind waiting a little while.

20:28.836 --> 20:32.968
- How was Her Majesty this morning?
- Her cold is troublesome. Her throat is sore.

20:33.053 --> 20:34.678
- Has it gone out of her nose?
-No.

20:34.764 --> 20:39.262
The best way to cure a sore throat
is to wrap a woollen sock at night, going to bed.

20:39.354 --> 20:42.144
- Oh?
- Good morning. Good morning, Contessa.

20:42.234 --> 20:43.777
Good morning, Your Excellency.

20:43.862 --> 20:46.105
- Is Emma still asleep?
- She is asleep.

20:46.199 --> 20:50.413
In my village, a husband just turns round in bed
and looks for himseIf to know.

20:50.498 --> 20:54.333
Yes, and the Queen of Naples does not wear
woollen socks to pin around her throat.

20:54.421 --> 20:59.001
If the Queen of Naples wore a hefty pair of
woollen socks, she wouldn't have a sore throat.

21:05.356 --> 21:08.312
- What's happened?
- I don't know.

21:11.157 --> 21:13.614
Maybe the smoking mountain went off again.

21:14.704 --> 21:17.161
Let's see. Come along.

21:31.232 --> 21:32.941
How wonderful! A battleship.

21:39.578 --> 21:43.163
You should see the Queen about this.
Salutes at this hour of the morning.

21:43.250 --> 21:46.836
Why shouldn't they blow their cannons off?
That's what they've got them for.

21:46.924 --> 21:48.039
Boom!

21:51.848 --> 21:53.888
- Boom!
- Good morning, my dear.

21:53.976 --> 21:56.018
Boom! Good morning, William.

21:56.105 --> 21:58.562
Here, give it to me.

22:05.329 --> 22:07.822
? Rule Britannia

22:07.917 --> 22:09.957
Let me look, my dear.

22:13.883 --> 22:15.841
There's a small boat coming ashore.

22:15.928 --> 22:19.180
They will probably need me.
Excuse me, my dear.

22:30.913 --> 22:33.370
- The mail is just in, Emma.
- I'll attend to it later.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.369
Here's a nice fat one from London.

22:35.461 --> 22:36.791
Oh.

22:36.880 --> 22:40.881
Her Excellency, Emma Lady Hamilton,
British Embassy, Naples.

22:42.723 --> 22:44.384
Charles Greville, London.

22:44.476 --> 22:46.517
Open it, child, open it.

22:46.604 --> 22:51.601
I think not. Send it back
and write on it, ''Unopened. Return to sender''.

22:51.695 --> 22:55.031
Poor Charles. He's exactly three years too late.

22:55.117 --> 22:58.241
And as far as I'm concerned,
he simply doesn't exist.

23:00.794 --> 23:02.835
Are you happy, my child?

23:03.632 --> 23:05.461
Happy?

23:05.553 --> 23:10.264
Three years ago, my only idea of happiness
was to be married to Charles Greville.

23:11.353 --> 23:13.395
After that, I wanted revenge.

23:14.609 --> 23:16.651
Well, I got that in a way, too.

23:17.740 --> 23:19.899
Then I wanted to be presented at court.

23:19.993 --> 23:22.782
And even that impossible wish was granted
to me.

23:24.583 --> 23:26.624
I've got everything.

23:26.712 --> 23:29.999
Everything a woman of the world
could possibly wish for.

23:30.759 --> 23:32.718
So why shouldn't I be happy?

23:32.804 --> 23:35.095
Of course, I'm happy, Mother.

23:35.184 --> 23:38.223
Well, Emma, what's good enough for you
is good enough for me.

23:38.315 --> 23:41.519
And being mother to Her Ladyship
is not to be sneezed at either.

23:41.611 --> 23:43.569
You silly old thing.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.231
You're lovely, Emma.
You're so beautiful, Emma.

23:46.327 --> 23:51.039
And what about you? Look at you with
your little cap and your silver buttons.

23:51.127 --> 23:53.584
And your beautiful skirt.

23:53.673 --> 23:55.715
You're the beautiful one.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.377
Your Ladyship,
could you spare me a moment, please?

23:58.473 --> 24:00.134
Yes, Gavin. I'm in a great hurry.

24:00.226 --> 24:03.181
It's about the dinner invitations for Sunday night.

24:03.272 --> 24:07.141
Then, of course, His Eminence the Archbishop,
the Duchess of Argyle,

24:07.236 --> 24:10.322
and if there's no performance
the Prima Donna of the San Carlo.

24:10.408 --> 24:13.245
- And the two ladies - which is deaf?
- The Contessa Giovanni.

24:13.330 --> 24:14.955
We put her on Sir William's right.

24:15.041 --> 24:18.127
Marquess Compiani the old harpy,
and the French Ambassador -

24:18.212 --> 24:19.957
we'll put him there between them.

24:20.048 --> 24:21.508
Oh, he'll have a nice time.

24:21.592 --> 24:25.890
Beg pardon, My Lady, but Sir William informs
me the French Ambassador cannot be invited.

24:26.810 --> 24:28.851
- Why ever not?
- Sir William mentioned

24:28.939 --> 24:33.771
Sir William mentioned... Sir William mentioned
there's a difference between the er...

24:33.865 --> 24:36.951
William, what's this absurd business
about the French Ambassador?

24:37.036 --> 24:38.911
l need him for the party on Sunday night.

24:38.998 --> 24:41.833
My dear, may I introduce
the captain of the Agamemnon?

24:41.918 --> 24:43.710
How do you do? But William, I need him.

24:43.796 --> 24:47.796
He's amusing and he's a bachelor and I need
a single man to make my number even.

24:47.885 --> 24:52.100
I'm sorry, my dear, but we won't be seeing
the French Ambassador for quite some time.

24:52.184 --> 24:53.810
Why? What's the matter with him?

24:53.895 --> 24:55.725
The captain can explain that.

24:55.817 --> 24:58.107
- He has a message.
- We're at war with France.

24:58.196 --> 25:01.697
War? That's torn it.
Bang goes the French Ambassador.

25:01.784 --> 25:06.579
Oh, dear. Who can I get to sit between
these two dreary old ladies?

25:10.841 --> 25:15.422
My dear captain, we shall be so delighted
if you will dine with us on Sunday night.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.968
You will sit between the two most amusing
and charming ladies in Naples.

25:19.061 --> 25:21.021
You're very kind, but I sail tonight.

25:21.107 --> 25:23.267
Oh, then I gather you must be in a hurry.

25:23.361 --> 25:26.614
Don't let me disturb your conference. I'm going.

25:28.954 --> 25:33.085
Well, Captain, you were saying
that the Admiral of the Fleet wanted...

25:33.169 --> 25:34.712
Yes, sir.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.506
Lord Hood advised me to instruct you...

25:41.682 --> 25:45.470
It's all right, Captain,
I have no secrets from Lady Hamilton.

25:45.565 --> 25:47.938
I'm very sorry, Sir William. You must forgive me.

25:48.027 --> 25:51.445
I'm not used to discussing matters of this kind
in the presence of ladies.

25:51.532 --> 25:54.570
Oh. Is it as wicked as all that? Good gracious.

25:54.662 --> 25:56.371
I promised to be with the Queen at 1 2.

25:56.456 --> 26:00.076
She won't order a single new dress
until I've discussed the patterns with her.

26:00.171 --> 26:02.462
That's a very great responsibility, my dear.

26:02.551 --> 26:04.592
- Goodbye, William.
- Goodbye.

26:09.937 --> 26:11.813
We've captured Toulon.

26:11.899 --> 26:15.851
The Admiral needs 10 000 troops to hold it
It would take three weeks from England

26:15.947 --> 26:18.107
From here, they should be in Toulon in two
days.

26:18.201 --> 26:21.406
The treaty between England and Naples
provides full co-operation

26:21.498 --> 26:24.917
and the Admiral expects you to secure those
troops from the King of Naples.

26:25.005 --> 26:27.295
I'll apply for an audience with the King.

26:27.383 --> 26:31.429
But surely in a matter as urgent as this,
we could see the King at once.

26:31.513 --> 26:35.015
At once? I can't just walk into the Royal Palace.

26:35.102 --> 26:37.975
Well, when will you get the audience?

26:38.066 --> 26:40.690
Friday may be possible.
Saturday almost certain.

26:40.779 --> 26:43.236
But we must have these troops immediately.

26:43.325 --> 26:47.955
You must leave this in my hands.
You see, I know these people and you don't.

26:48.041 --> 26:50.082
I'll make out the application at once.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.405
EMMA: Yes, that's me too.

27:10.995 --> 27:12.870
Do you like it? It's a Romney.

27:12.956 --> 27:15.495
Circe watching her lover sail away.

27:17.047 --> 27:18.245
Is it?

27:18.340 --> 27:22.092
You know, I could get you those troops like that.

27:22.180 --> 27:27.808
You were speaking rather loudly, Captain, and
the houses get so stuffy if you close the doors.

27:27.898 --> 27:31.353
You're worried, aren't you?
You have an important mission, haven't you?

27:31.447 --> 27:34.865
Has it ever occurred to you that women can
sometimes be of more help than men?

27:34.953 --> 27:36.946
Not in a matter of this kind, Lady Hamilton.

27:37.039 --> 27:38.285
How do you know?

27:38.375 --> 27:43.372
It just happens that I shall be seeing the Queen
within the next ten minutes.

27:43.466 --> 27:46.918
The Queen? This is an important matter of state.

27:47.012 --> 27:49.634
All the more reason to see the Queen.

27:51.144 --> 27:53.306
Now I'll let you into a secret, Captain.

27:53.399 --> 27:55.440
Which everyone in Europe knows.

27:55.528 --> 27:57.153
Except you, Captain.

27:57.239 --> 28:00.859
The real King of Naples is the Queen.

28:00.953 --> 28:03.242
E licenziata, hai capito?

28:10.968 --> 28:14.423
Her Majesty is pleased
to be with her children this hour.

28:14.517 --> 28:17.305
But my orders are to let My Lady in any time.

28:17.396 --> 28:23.023
Even if the princes and princesses please
to be with their august parents.

28:23.114 --> 28:25.404
The august family appears to be pretty big.

28:25.493 --> 28:28.744
The marriage of the august parents
is continuously blessed.

28:28.831 --> 28:32.666
There are 15 princes and princesses so far.
You will see.

28:35.133 --> 28:37.174
Lady Hamilton!

29:27.052 --> 29:30.672
''I have the honour to be etc, etc, etc.''
And I'll sign it at once.

29:31.517 --> 29:32.763
Phew!

29:44.998 --> 29:48.915
Here we are, Captain. I'll have this application
to the palace in haIf an hour.

29:49.005 --> 29:53.052
I thought it advisable to ask for only 8,000 men.
We may get as many as 5,000.

29:53.136 --> 29:57.267
We asked for 20,000 and we got 1 0,000. There.

29:59.689 --> 30:01.813
I'm very much indebted to Lady Hamilton

30:01.901 --> 30:05.272
Her campaign against the Queen
was a masterpiece of strategy.

30:05.365 --> 30:08.818
Well, there, my dear captain,
you see the real Ambassador to Naples.

30:08.912 --> 30:10.740
At least to the Queen of Naples.

30:10.832 --> 30:14.913
Captain, now that you have your soldiers,
there's no need for you to leave so soon.

30:15.004 --> 30:18.257
You can go tomorrow. We'll have a wonderful
party on your ship tonight.

30:18.343 --> 30:22.973
I'll bring the Queen and you'll get the King if
you'll allow him to conduct the ship's orchestra.

30:23.060 --> 30:26.764
We'll sail out to Capri.
By midnight, we'll be at the Blue Grotto.

30:26.859 --> 30:31.155
Capri by moonlight.
You've no idea how beautiful the world can be.

30:31.241 --> 30:36.320
We'll decorate the ship with flowers. And I'll
dance. I expect you've heard of my dances.

30:36.415 --> 30:39.169
The Dance Of The Nymph
goes beautifully with a night on a ship

30:39.254 --> 30:44.547
I'll wear a long tunic of pale blue cashmere.

30:45.388 --> 30:48.556
No high coiffure. Just loose hair.

30:48.643 --> 30:52.264
Like a Greek Goddess Gavin we're to have
a party on the battleship tonight

30:52.358 --> 30:54.981
Get out the Chinese lanterns
to send to the harbour.

30:55.070 --> 30:58.027
And ask the chef to make big steak pies,
100 of them.

30:58.118 --> 31:01.453
And get some rum for the sailors.
It is rum they drink, isn't it, Captain?

31:01.540 --> 31:03.664
It will be magnificent, stupendous.

31:03.751 --> 31:06.291
- Won't I be wonderful, William?
- You will.

31:06.380 --> 31:10.463
I'm sorry to be ungallant, but I've just been
summoned to weigh anchor immediately.

31:10.554 --> 31:14.970
May I present my son,
midshipman on the Agamemnon?

31:15.062 --> 31:16.773
Such a big son.

31:16.858 --> 31:19.101
- My step-son.
-Your wife lives in England?

31:19.195 --> 31:20.774
Yes, sir, in Norfolk.

31:20.865 --> 31:23.737
And this young man is your chaperone.

31:23.827 --> 31:26.069
Precisely. He keeps a good watch on me.

31:26.163 --> 31:28.702
- Goodbye, Sir William.
- Goodbye, Captain.

31:28.792 --> 31:30.252
Goodbye, Lady Hamilton.

31:30.336 --> 31:32.875
May I say,
you've done good service for your country?

31:32.965 --> 31:37.381
It's been rather fun, hasn't it? If you're passing
Naples again, I hope you'll come and see us.

31:37.473 --> 31:42.019
And next time, there's no need to blow off
your cannons, just knock at the door.

31:42.106 --> 31:43.269
Goodbye.

31:43.358 --> 31:44.984
What was your name?

31:45.070 --> 31:46.731
Nelson.

31:51.455 --> 31:56.287
William, did I seem very silly,
talking about the party in the moonlight?

31:56.381 --> 31:58.421
Silly? Of course, my dear.

31:58.509 --> 32:01.511
But delightfully silly. My Emma at her best.

32:01.597 --> 32:03.471
I wonder.

32:03.557 --> 32:05.598
He was so serious.

32:05.685 --> 32:07.929
All of a sudden, I began to feel foolish.

32:08.023 --> 32:12.772
I don't think a woman can be at her best,
playing the fool with news of war.

32:12.865 --> 32:14.491
Don't think about it, my dear.

32:14.577 --> 32:18.244
War is a sordid, ugly thing,
so there's no need for them to bother you.

32:18.333 --> 32:20.457
My Lady, your dancing master's here.

32:20.544 --> 32:23.215
- Shall I show him to the dancing room?
-No, send him away.

32:23.298 --> 32:25.625
- But, Emma.
- I don't feel like dancing.

32:25.719 --> 32:29.255
William, you've left certain gaps in my
education. This war, for instance.

32:29.349 --> 32:31.308
- I know nothing about it.
- But my dear...

32:31.395 --> 32:34.683
Every time I ask you a serious question,
you begin shuffling about.

32:34.776 --> 32:36.818
Tell me about it. How did it happen?

32:36.905 --> 32:40.821
- It's very dull, my dear.
- I don't care how dull it is. I want to know.

32:40.910 --> 32:42.536
Well...

32:42.622 --> 32:44.248
here's England.

32:46.461 --> 32:48.171
Such a tiny little bit.

32:48.257 --> 32:49.668
Where are we?

32:49.759 --> 32:52.465
Here at Naples.

32:52.555 --> 32:54.098
But why should England fight?

32:54.182 --> 32:58.314
Because all through these centuries,
she has built up a commonwealth,

32:58.398 --> 33:02.730
in which every little spot has its purpose
and value to the balance line of life.

33:02.822 --> 33:07.202
And there are always men,
who for the sake of their insane ambition,

33:07.288 --> 33:09.614
want to destroy what other people build.

33:09.708 --> 33:13.958
And therefore, this tiny little bit,
as you call it, Emma,

33:14.049 --> 33:20.173
has to send out its ships again and again to fight
those who want to dictate their will to others.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.602
EMMA: Then came five years of war

33:24.859 --> 33:26.899
We fought alone with no allies

33:28.030 --> 33:31.401
The whole of Europe in deadly fear
of Napoleon Bonaparte

33:32.704 --> 33:36.834
Nothing between him and the conquest
of the world but a few ships

33:42.178 --> 33:43.923
And Nelson

33:44.015 --> 33:47.220
MAN: His Majesty is pleased to award you
the Knighthood of the Bath

33:47.312 --> 33:50.434
and you are promoted to Rear Admiral
of the Blue

33:50.526 --> 33:53.730
Sir Horatio, that's wonderful.
The men will be delighted.

33:53.821 --> 33:55.364
Oh, yes.

33:55.449 --> 33:59.579
We'll catch Bonaparte in a week,
if we have an extra button on our coat tails.

33:59.664 --> 34:04.377
Five years of this war and gentlemen in London
think that men can go on without water or food.

34:04.465 --> 34:06.672
And I can fight the enemy without ammunition.

34:06.760 --> 34:11.092
Even His Excellency the Ambassador here
sees fit to ignore our plight.

34:11.184 --> 34:12.762
What's the matter with the lamp?

34:12.853 --> 34:15.393
It's nearly empty, sir. No more oil on board.

34:17.152 --> 34:19.360
Well, turn it down.

34:20.867 --> 34:23.027
NELSON: Hardy?
- Yes, sir.

34:23.121 --> 34:24.664
Sir Horatio from now on, sir.

34:24.748 --> 34:26.789
Oh, not to you, Hardy.

34:26.876 --> 34:29.333
Captain always, I hope.

34:29.420 --> 34:32.210
Captain or Sir Horatio,
I can't stand this any longer.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.009
What's Sir William Hamilton doing?

34:34.094 --> 34:36.848
Why don't we sail up to Naples
and blow 'em out of their beds?

34:36.931 --> 34:38.975
They'd give us water and meat then.

34:39.063 --> 34:42.232
- Do you expect me to fire at a neutral port?
- Neutral?

34:42.318 --> 34:44.359
Neutral against England?

34:44.447 --> 34:48.282
Yes. Things were different when we were here
five years ago, weren't they?

34:48.370 --> 34:50.612
Our braid was shining in those days.

34:50.706 --> 34:54.623
Today they won't even let us anchor
in the harbour as though we had the plague.

34:54.713 --> 34:58.381
They're so scared of Bonaparte,
they daren't help the people who fight him.

34:59.471 --> 35:00.931
Starboard!

35:07.567 --> 35:09.692
What a wonderful way to get upstairs.

35:15.372 --> 35:17.200
How exciting.

35:18.711 --> 35:20.455
At last I'm on a battleship.

35:20.547 --> 35:22.920
NELSON: Trowbridge, did you get anything?

35:23.009 --> 35:24.801
Sir, there is someone here with me.

35:24.887 --> 35:27.426
- The Ambassador.
- No sir Lady Hamilton

35:27.516 --> 35:30.056
Is there no light? I can't see anything.

35:30.146 --> 35:32.187
Everything's so dark.

35:32.275 --> 35:34.815
Where's Horatio?

35:34.905 --> 35:37.065
Turn up the lamp Josiah

35:39.955 --> 35:42.364
NELSON: How is Sir William? Ill, I presume?

35:43.460 --> 35:46.996
You must please forgive me
if I seem a little abrupt.

35:47.090 --> 35:50.675
We've been living here under great difficulties.
No food or fresh water.

35:50.762 --> 35:52.424
No rum no tobacco

35:52.516 --> 35:57.478
The Neapolitans have forgotten that they're our
allies and that we're fighting for their cause too.

35:57.566 --> 36:00.937
That is why I sent Trowbridge to ask Sir William

36:01.030 --> 36:03.071
to remind the King...

36:03.158 --> 36:05.199
What is the matter?

36:12.049 --> 36:15.255
Oh... Why, I'm sorry, yes.

36:17.057 --> 36:22.980
You must please excuse these little souvenirs
of Calvi and Tenerife.

36:23.066 --> 36:25.107
I had no idea.

36:25.195 --> 36:30.489
They told us of your victories,
but not of the price you had paid.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.988
Do not distress yourself, please.

36:33.083 --> 36:35.325
Tell me your news. Did Sir William see the King?

36:35.419 --> 36:38.756
- The King refused to see him.
- Refused to see the British Ambassador?

36:38.842 --> 36:41.381
I ought to have said
he was too terrified to see him.

36:41.471 --> 36:43.465
You cannot realise how Naples has changed.

36:43.558 --> 36:47.060
Have they gone out of their senses?
What do they think I am trying to do?

36:47.147 --> 36:50.769
Bonaparte's fleet is in Egypt.
For the first time I know where they are.

36:50.862 --> 36:54.150
If I can smash them up,
Europe has a chance to breathe again.

36:54.243 --> 36:56.283
And it's the first time he's been stopped.

36:56.371 --> 36:58.910
And yet they will not give me food or water
for my ships.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.457
When I saw that William was wasting his time,

37:01.545 --> 37:03.705
I took the liberty of seeing the Queen.

37:03.799 --> 37:07.302
I've never had such a time in all my life.
She's terrified of the French.

37:07.389 --> 37:10.096
- But I got it.
- What is that?

37:10.185 --> 37:12.975
A mandate, signed and sealed
by the Queen's own hand,

37:13.066 --> 37:17.695
for the full watering and victualling of the British
fleet in any port in the Kingdom of Naples.

37:17.781 --> 37:19.609
There.

37:29.008 --> 37:33.755
Look out, Bonaparte.
By gad, we shall lick you now.

37:43.407 --> 37:45.448
Tell the Queen I kiss her letter.

37:45.536 --> 37:50.116
Tell her I hope to kiss her hand
when we return from our victory.

37:51.253 --> 37:53.377
Won't you sit down? You must be tired.

37:58.263 --> 38:01.635
Do you remember the picnic we planned at
Capri on your ship?

38:01.728 --> 38:05.812
When I was going to dance in the moonlight
with my hair down five years ago.

38:05.903 --> 38:07.730
Or was it five centuries?

38:07.822 --> 38:10.030
When I rudely sailed away.

38:10.117 --> 38:14.745
And now you're going to rudely sail away again.
How's it been with you all these years?

38:14.832 --> 38:16.991
Alone, you know.

38:17.085 --> 38:20.291
You've done a great many things.
How is your wife?

38:20.383 --> 38:23.255
Oh, she's well enough, I believe.

38:23.346 --> 38:25.553
And when are you going to meet Bonaparte?

38:25.641 --> 38:27.552
- Soon, I hope.
- He's got haIf of Europe

38:27.645 --> 38:29.022
Now it's Egypt.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.649
Tomorrow it may be lndia.

38:30.734 --> 38:33.736
We are alone, but unafraid.

38:33.823 --> 38:35.366
SAlLOR: Haul away!

38:35.450 --> 38:37.029
You long to leave, don't you?

38:37.120 --> 38:39.161
Never lose an hour or waste a wind

38:39.249 --> 38:42.620
Goodbye, Sir Horatio.
It's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?

38:42.712 --> 38:44.753
Yes. Goodbye, Lady Hamilton.

38:44.841 --> 38:47.759
You've helped us for the second time.

38:49.180 --> 38:53.262
He didn't lose an hour. He didn't waste a wind.

38:53.354 --> 38:56.939
He met his great opponent
and he defeated him on the Nile

38:58.362 --> 39:05.248
And when the battle was over
he didn't go back to his country or to his king

39:05.332 --> 39:07.373
or to his wife

39:07.460 --> 39:09.501
he came back

39:09.588 --> 39:11.215
to me

39:50.280 --> 39:52.856
- Stop. Fetch a doctor quickly.

39:52.952 --> 39:56.039
Fetch a doctor quickly. Send everyone away.
A doctor quickly.

40:04.679 --> 40:06.719
What's come over you, madam?

40:10.690 --> 40:12.933
A doctor? Who wants a doctor?

40:14.821 --> 40:17.859
But you staggered out there and nearly fell.

40:18.952 --> 40:20.993
I'm perfectly well.

40:27.006 --> 40:29.048
Shoul...der!

40:35.856 --> 40:38.527
Your Majesty, I'm amazed.

40:38.610 --> 40:40.853
Cosa dice?

40:40.947 --> 40:43.320
l must speak to the King. Help me, Sir William.

40:45.370 --> 40:47.281
Lui vuole parlare con te.

40:47.373 --> 40:48.704
Va bene.

40:48.793 --> 40:51.416
Aspetta qui.

40:53.592 --> 40:55.966
Tell him I didn't come to Naples to be feted.

40:56.054 --> 40:59.342
In other times, I should be grateful,
but today I am appalled by it.

40:59.434 --> 41:02.973
I came here expecting to find an armed camp
and I find this tragic carnival.

41:03.067 --> 41:06.688
This Battle of the Nile that he's celebrating
may have destroyed their fleet,

41:06.782 --> 41:09.535
but his army's as strong as ever
and two days' from Naples.

41:09.620 --> 41:13.240
Yet the men of Naples dance in the streets
with paper caps and toy balloons.

41:13.333 --> 41:17.118
Maestà, Nelson dice che non è venuto
à Napoli per...

41:17.213 --> 41:19.207
Qu'est qu'il y a, ma chère?

41:20.301 --> 41:24.552
He says he has confidence in the English
and feels sure they will do what is necessary.

41:24.643 --> 41:29.024
Well, tell him we're not the guardian angels of
every country too lazy to look after itself.

41:29.109 --> 41:31.151
You've got to do something too!

41:31.239 --> 41:35.073
At the Nile, we cleared them off the seas,
but as long as they have armies on land,

41:35.161 --> 41:38.698
no country in Europe is free.
They want to get hold of the whole world.

41:38.917 --> 41:41.374
If you value your freedom, stir yourselves.

41:41.462 --> 41:43.790
Prepare and help drive them off the land!

41:43.884 --> 41:45.961
Ma perche l'Ammiraglio è cosi nervoso?

41:46.054 --> 41:48.973
I'm talking of Bonaparte, Your Majesty!
Bonaparte!

41:49.058 --> 41:54.684
Either advance toward him sword in hand
or else be kicked out of your kingdom.

41:54.775 --> 41:57.398
Lady Hamilton, may I speak to you?

42:05.460 --> 42:07.419
You called for a doctor just now.

42:07.506 --> 42:10.877
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
I thought you were ill.

42:10.969 --> 42:13.758
Well, for heaven's sake...

42:15.309 --> 42:17.351
..where is the doctor?

42:36.260 --> 42:38.931
This is the third time you've helped me.

42:47.278 --> 42:50.780
You've been here night and day. How long?

42:50.868 --> 42:52.909
EMMA: Nine days

42:54.916 --> 42:57.457
- What an enormous bed.
- It's my bed

42:58.924 --> 43:00.716
There's room for six people in it.

43:00.802 --> 43:03.211
There may be. I've never tried.

43:03.306 --> 43:04.931
Why am in your bed?

43:05.017 --> 43:07.259
They couldn't move you to the hospital

43:11.359 --> 43:16.155
Of all that ghastly crowd, you were
the only one who knew that I was ill.

43:16.243 --> 43:18.283
A nice cup of beef tea.

43:19.540 --> 43:22.791
- That'll put some go into him.
- Who's that?

43:22.878 --> 43:24.919
It's all right, milord. Just Emma's mother.

43:25.006 --> 43:27.048
Emma's mother...

43:28.179 --> 43:30.753
..do you think I could call her Emma too?

43:30.849 --> 43:34.270
Why ask me?
You've been calling her Emma all this time.

43:34.358 --> 43:36.398
Now, don't say anymore.

43:37.863 --> 43:39.904
Here you are.

43:40.993 --> 43:42.404
There.

43:42.495 --> 43:46.280
Now I'll tell you all the news
and all the gossip too, if you're interested.

43:46.375 --> 43:50.790
First item, the King of England is pleased
to elevate Sir Horatio Nelson to the peerage.

43:50.882 --> 43:52.923
You are now Lord Nelson.

43:53.011 --> 43:57.343
Second item, the King of Naples has given you
the dukedom of Bronte.

43:57.435 --> 43:59.679
You are now a duke and a baron.

43:59.773 --> 44:03.987
Third item, the whole of Europe sings
your praises, the victor of the Nile.

44:04.071 --> 44:07.109
It wouldn't have been possible without you.

44:07.201 --> 44:10.655
I'm going to tell them.
I'm going to let the whole world know.

44:10.749 --> 44:13.076
I told you not to talk. You've got to rest.

44:13.169 --> 44:17.383
In a week, you can get up. Then for another
week, you can have nothing but goat's milk.

44:17.468 --> 44:21.931
Disgusting.
I shall be able to get up in a day or two..

44:22.016 --> 44:25.353
You can get up
when you are told you can get up.

44:25.440 --> 44:28.859
Yes, ma'am. Goat's milk for a week and
I get up when I'm told.

44:28.946 --> 44:30.987
That's better.

44:31.075 --> 44:33.115
We need you now, Lord Nelson.

44:33.203 --> 44:35.529
In these times the whole world needs you.

44:35.623 --> 44:37.664
And I need you more than anyone else.

44:37.751 --> 44:41.336
As soon as you are well, the King has
commanded a gala performance of the opera

44:41.424 --> 44:43.797
and I want to wear my new dress from London.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.132
Gala performance?

44:46.222 --> 44:48.977
Opera?
When they ought to be mobilising armies.

44:49.061 --> 44:51.601
They're doomed and don't want to realise it.

44:51.691 --> 44:53.732
You mustn't excite yourself.

44:57.784 --> 45:02.164
Would you do me a kindness
and write a letter for me, Emma?

45:02.250 --> 45:03.793
Of course.

45:05.714 --> 45:07.755
To whom?

45:07.842 --> 45:09.836
Lady Nelson.

45:11.473 --> 45:15.556
Burnham Thorpe Norfolk England

45:19.236 --> 45:21.360
I wonder what she looks like now.

45:21.447 --> 45:23.488
I haven't seen her for seven years

45:23.577 --> 45:26.331
I wonder why we sailors ever marry

45:26.415 --> 45:28.325
Do you want that to go in?

45:28.418 --> 45:31.421
Good heavens, no.

45:33.217 --> 45:35.257
My dear wife

45:35.344 --> 45:37.053
My dear wife...

45:37.139 --> 45:40.345
My heartiest greetings from Naples
to you and Father.

45:43.359 --> 45:45.399
I'm in the house of the Hamiltons

45:45.487 --> 45:52.871
and it has taken all their care
and kindness to pull me through.

45:52.958 --> 45:59.463
I hope some day to have the pleasure
of introducing you to Lady Hamilton

46:01.139 --> 46:06.267
Lady Hamilton is one of the very best women
in the world...

46:08.567 --> 46:11.023
and an honour to her sex

46:22.298 --> 46:27.092
? La ci darem la mano

46:27.180 --> 46:31.015
? La mi dirai di si

46:32.356 --> 46:36.819
? Vedi, non è lontano

46:36.905 --> 46:41.736
? Partiam, ben mio, da qui

46:41.830 --> 46:44.239
? Vorrei e mon ver-rai

46:46.462 --> 46:48.253
Ferdinando!

46:48.339 --> 46:52.838
? Mi tremaun pocoil cor

46:52.930 --> 46:57.395
? Felice e ver sarei

46:57.481 --> 47:02.691
? Ma puo burlarmiancor

47:05.159 --> 47:09.870
? Neopolitan folk song

47:26.110 --> 47:29.362
Do you know what they're having
at the palace now?

47:29.449 --> 47:32.155
Mushrooms from Switzerland,
pheasants from England,

47:32.245 --> 47:33.990
wine from Spain.

47:34.082 --> 47:36.621
120 years old and £5 a bottle.

47:36.711 --> 47:39.168
And here sits the hero of the evening
missing it all.

47:41.426 --> 47:43.135
Are you missing it all?

47:43.221 --> 47:46.638
Of course not. The real and exclusive party
of the evening is here.

47:46.726 --> 47:49.646
Besides, I know exactly
what's happening at the palace.

47:49.732 --> 47:51.774
The Queen...

47:51.862 --> 47:54.354
Ferdinando! Taci! Taci! Ferdinando!

47:54.449 --> 47:58.117
And the King, the poor little King
with 15 children and the Kingdom of Naples

47:58.206 --> 48:00.449
and never an answer to give to his queen.

48:00.543 --> 48:02.582
And here sits the British Ambassador.

48:02.670 --> 48:05.708
Bored and dreaming only
of his last statue from Pompeii.

48:05.800 --> 48:09.253
And throughout the evening
there sits Lord Nelson,

48:09.347 --> 48:12.350
exhibiting his various moods one by one.

48:12.436 --> 48:14.976
Lord Nelson in a bad mood.

48:15.066 --> 48:17.106
Lord Nelson in a good mood.

48:17.194 --> 48:19.152
Lord Nelson in an exuberant mood.

48:20.450 --> 48:23.536
Am I really such a dull fellow?

48:23.621 --> 48:25.948
Only when you ask questions like that.

48:26.042 --> 48:29.211
And now it's my turn to give you
a little presentation.

48:29.297 --> 48:31.042
What mood is this?

48:31.134 --> 48:33.258
One guess.

48:36.976 --> 48:42.520
Nelson allowing himself
to be just a little bit happy?

48:45.531 --> 48:47.443
Nelson in love.

49:10.740 --> 49:13.315
Of all the inns in Naples, you choose this one.

49:13.411 --> 49:18.159
Probably the last place in Naples
where they expected to find me.

49:18.252 --> 49:20.126
Were you at the opera tonight, my dear?

49:20.213 --> 49:22.253
No? You should have been.

49:22.341 --> 49:24.669
There was quite a profusion of barmaids.

49:24.762 --> 49:28.134
Some even found their way to the royal box

49:29.981 --> 49:31.559
He's drunk.

49:31.650 --> 49:35.400
l see you're not married, my dear. What a pity.

49:35.489 --> 49:39.323
Married women are bestowing their favours
so cheaply these days

49:39.412 --> 49:42.368
He's never behaved like this before.

49:42.459 --> 49:46.293
Friends, I give you the real hero of the hour.

49:46.382 --> 49:48.091
Sir William Hamilton.

49:55.271 --> 49:57.312
That's an excellent toast, Josiah.

49:58.651 --> 50:00.610
May I drink it with you?

50:05.037 --> 50:07.280
Thank you.

50:07.374 --> 50:08.917
Sir William Hamilton.

50:13.008 --> 50:15.547
Lady Hamilton and I are leaving. Fetch a cab.

50:17.474 --> 50:19.884
Don't let us disturb you, lads. You're off duty.

50:24.946 --> 50:26.524
Enjoy yourselves.

50:35.336 --> 50:37.376
Forgive them, my dear.

50:37.464 --> 50:40.004
They are very... very young.

50:41.095 --> 50:43.089
I have forgiven them.

50:44.183 --> 50:46.179
That's the way people look at these things.

50:46.272 --> 50:49.773
They do not believe in a friendship
between a man and a woman.

50:52.823 --> 50:54.818
Do you?

51:33.557 --> 51:35.597
All right, later. Later.

51:40.528 --> 51:43.363
It was magnificent! Stupendous!

51:43.448 --> 51:45.573
Wasn't I wonderful, William?

51:45.660 --> 51:47.321
Wasn't it a success?

51:47.413 --> 51:50.784
A triumph.
The greatest ball ever seen in Naples.

51:50.877 --> 51:52.918
You were stupendous.

51:53.006 --> 51:56.459
You entertained 200 people as easily
as you enchant a solitary husband.

51:56.553 --> 52:02.476
The King said to me, ''Milady, la sua bellezza mi
fa dimenticare tutte le pensieri della realta.''

52:02.563 --> 52:06.610
And Hardy, good old Hardy said,
''Well, I'll be blowed, Your Ladyship.

52:06.694 --> 52:10.315
What I mean to say is,
well, you know what I mean.''

52:10.409 --> 52:13.246
And... Oh, goodness! I'm so tired!

52:13.330 --> 52:14.910
What did he say?

52:15.001 --> 52:16.412
He who?

52:16.503 --> 52:17.998
He.

52:19.089 --> 52:22.425
Oh, he didn't say anything.
He never says much, you know.

52:22.512 --> 52:26.346
People were saying that he should have sat
on your right during dinner,

52:26.435 --> 52:27.681
not on your left

52:27.771 --> 52:32.068
What? And give the Queen the side
with the eye on it? Not likely.

52:32.153 --> 52:33.483
He seemed very happy.

52:33.572 --> 52:37.025
Yes, I really think he's better now.

52:37.119 --> 52:39.493
Tonight, he seemed to forget everything.

52:39.581 --> 52:41.824
Ships, the war, Napoleon, everything.

52:41.918 --> 52:45.871
Could any man think of worldly cares
in the spell of Emma's magic?

52:45.967 --> 52:48.721
He deserved his happiness this evening

52:48.806 --> 52:52.759
After such happiness how sad to find oneself
the next morning at sea again.

52:52.854 --> 52:54.895
And at war

52:56.651 --> 52:59.689
What do you mean?
We're going to Pompeii tomorrow.

52:59.781 --> 53:01.608
Lord Nelson will be on his way to Malta.

53:01.700 --> 53:04.239
I think there must be some mistake, William.

53:04.329 --> 53:07.951
Lord Nelson left ten minutes ago and said
he would be with us at 12 tomorrow.

53:08.045 --> 53:11.048
The dispatch arrived while dessert
was being served.

53:11.133 --> 53:13.294
I had it sent straight aboard his ship

53:13.388 --> 53:16.474
He's probably reading it at this very moment

53:17.602 --> 53:19.930
Why didn't you tell me this before, William?

53:20.024 --> 53:23.775
But my dear I wouldn't have spoilt
your evening for anything in the world

53:23.864 --> 53:26.486
You mean,
you wouldn't have spoiled yours for anything.

53:26.576 --> 53:30.196
You tried to prevent me
from saying goodbye to him

53:32.293 --> 53:33.752
You know Emma

53:33.836 --> 53:37.123
there are three kinds of deceived husbands
in the world.

53:37.216 --> 53:39.839
First there are those
who were born to be deceived.

53:39.929 --> 53:41.971
Second, who do not know.

53:42.059 --> 53:44.433
And third, who do not care.

53:44.522 --> 53:48.737
I've been wondering for some time now,
which of the three I should be myself.

53:48.821 --> 53:51.396
Have you forgotten the fourth kind, William?

53:51.492 --> 53:55.788
The kind that is hard and empty
and gives nothing.

53:56.917 --> 54:00.288
You married me because you wanted
a new ornament for your house.

54:00.381 --> 54:04.001
Like that painting or that statue or that vase.

54:05.097 --> 54:08.468
As far as you're concerned,
I'm just as ornamental.

54:08.560 --> 54:10.353
And just as dead.

54:10.439 --> 54:13.810
But, my dear,
how can you call my statues dead?

54:13.903 --> 54:18.782
When I'm alone and rather tired, think what
it means for me to have my statues with me.

54:18.870 --> 54:21.444
To know that they'll always be lovely,

54:21.540 --> 54:25.492
will never grow old,
and never walk out with sailors.

54:30.721 --> 54:33.131
What a pity you're not going to see him again.

54:33.226 --> 54:36.811
It would have been a farewell scene
of lasting beauty.

54:36.899 --> 54:38.941
I shall sleep beautifully tonight.

54:39.028 --> 54:41.070
Good night, my dear.

54:58.350 --> 55:02.565
My darling...come back.

55:04.026 --> 55:06.067
Come back.

55:08.450 --> 55:13.199
Emily, he's waiting for you...out on the balcony.

56:02.497 --> 56:06.247
You shouldn't have come.
People will see you. They'll talk.

56:06.336 --> 56:08.829
Oh, let them talk. I don't care. Do you?

56:08.924 --> 56:11.002
Are you sorry?

56:11.095 --> 56:14.466
I'm only sorry for all the wasted years
I've been without you.

56:14.559 --> 56:16.886
For all the years I shall have to be without you.

56:16.980 --> 56:18.725
You'll come back, won't you?

56:19.818 --> 56:21.858
I wonder if I shall.

56:21.946 --> 56:23.987
I feel I should not.

56:24.074 --> 56:26.115
You are married and I am married.

56:27.454 --> 56:31.538
In the magic and music and the ballroom,
these things become rather blurred.

56:31.628 --> 56:34.085
But they stand out very clearly in the dawn.

56:35.593 --> 56:37.586
Your life is here.

56:37.679 --> 56:41.929
My life is...there.

56:43.314 --> 56:46.936
We must obey the creeds and codes
that we've sworn our lives to.

56:48.073 --> 56:49.817
kn ow t h at must n ot co m e back

56:51.411 --> 56:54.497
And I know that nothing in this world
can keep me away.

57:01.802 --> 57:03.843
Up oars!

57:21.375 --> 57:22.835
Down!

57:22.919 --> 57:26.125
Pull, oarsmen!

57:34.565 --> 57:36.394
Together!

58:01.776 --> 58:06.240
If I understand you correctly, sir,
our first objective is to recover Malta.

58:06.325 --> 58:10.372
In that case, I suggest we send
the Culloden, the Lion and the Goliath,

58:10.457 --> 58:13.626
under Ball, to blockade the island
and then take possession of it.

58:43.803 --> 58:45.631
Aiuto!

58:53.736 --> 58:55.195
Excuse me, sir.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.445
What is it?

58:56.533 --> 59:00.699
We've just picked up a fishing boat
with refugees from Naples

59:00.790 --> 59:02.665
Refugees from Naples?

59:02.751 --> 59:04.994
Yes, sir. They say revolution has broken out.

59:05.088 --> 59:09.836
The Government got away, but the King
and Queen are locked up in the palace.

59:09.929 --> 59:12.006
I don't understand everything he says sir

59:12.099 --> 59:16.314
but there must be plenty of shooting looting
and murdering in the town

59:21.073 --> 59:25.072
That's what you've always said, sir.
Just wait until we've gone. Serves them right.

59:25.162 --> 59:27.785
If they can't help themselves nobody else can

59:27.875 --> 59:30.794
This is Lord Keith's orders
We've got to meet the Alexander

59:30.879 --> 59:33.837
the Foudroyant and the Minotaur
at the point of intersection

59:39.060 --> 59:42.017
Blackwood, go back to your ship.

59:43.109 --> 59:46.694
Arrange with Ball to blockade Malta.

59:46.781 --> 59:49.487
The rest of the fleet sails to Messina

59:49.577 --> 59:52.415
Well, what course are you taking, sir?

59:54.252 --> 59:56.210
Back to Naples.

59:59.718 --> 01:00:01.629
What are you waiting for, Trowbridge?

01:00:01.722 --> 01:00:03.846
But, sir, Lord Keith's orders...

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:07.436
Lord Keith's orders are addressed to me!
Mine are addressed to you.

01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:10.148
- Yes, sir.
- Return to your ships at once

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:18.954
HARDY: May I speak sir?

01:00:21.545 --> 01:00:22.921
Yes.

01:00:23.006 --> 01:00:25.581
I'm under your order, sir. I'll do as I'm told.

01:00:25.677 --> 01:00:29.464
I'll sail this ship anywhere
where there's water under her keel.

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:32.267
But I implore you,
call Blackwood and Trowbridge back,

01:00:32.357 --> 01:00:34.267
and send the fleet where it's ordered to

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.980
And leave our allies the King and Queen
of Naples at the mercy of that rabble?

01:00:38.074 --> 01:00:40.115
You know what that mob will do to them.

01:00:40.202 --> 01:00:43.074
Do you want them to build that bestial guillotine
in Naples?

01:00:43.165 --> 01:00:46.501
But in London they will say
it wasn't the Royal Family you went back for.

01:00:46.588 --> 01:00:48.878
- Be careful what you say!
- I will say it!

01:00:48.967 --> 01:00:50.759
They will say it was for Lady Hamilton.

01:00:50.844 --> 01:00:53.515
Let them say it. Let them say what they wish!

01:00:53.599 --> 01:00:57.895
l will not see those I love
and owe loyalty to left alone.

01:01:01.779 --> 01:01:03.819
Back to Naples

01:01:03.907 --> 01:01:05.949
I understand, sir.

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:26.313
In the face of such open disobedience,
I must ask your Lordships for a clear decision.

01:01:26.403 --> 01:01:28.196
Where is Nelson now?

01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:32.661
At Palermo, where he took the whole party
after he got them away from Naples.

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:38.039
As much as I dislike discussing personalities
and private matters,

01:01:38.129 --> 01:01:42.296
I must say he does not behave in a manner
befitting a British Admiral.

01:01:42.387 --> 01:01:45.342
Hear, hear.
I quite agree with what you're saying.

01:01:45.725 --> 01:01:47.221
Gentlemen.

01:01:47.312 --> 01:01:48.427
Gentlemen.

01:01:48.522 --> 01:01:51.691
Lord Nelson has some excuse
for his disobedience.

01:01:51.778 --> 01:01:54.235
How can there be an excuse for disobedience?

01:01:54.324 --> 01:01:59.618
He did save the royal family of an allied nation
from certain death at the hands of the mob.

01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:02.462
He also saved the British Ambassador
and his wife.

01:02:02.546 --> 01:02:05.715
- What's the point of saving the husband?

01:02:07.512 --> 01:02:09.552
Yes, you think it very funny.

01:02:09.639 --> 01:02:12.596
The whole of England thinks it's funny.
The whole of Europe.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:15.939
- But it's high time that...
- Steady, Keith. Steady.

01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:20.073
No-one questions the seriousness of this matter.

01:02:20.157 --> 01:02:22.780
Lord Nelson is a very gallant sailor.

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:25.908
But not even the greatest hero is strong enough

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.336
to defeat the prejudices
and conventions of society.

01:02:29.422 --> 01:02:32.378
We must be tolerant of poor Nelson.

01:02:32.469 --> 01:02:35.043
lt'd be best to bring him home at once.

01:02:35.139 --> 01:02:40.436
Let him say farewell
to this charming little romance of his.

01:02:40.526 --> 01:02:44.193
Let him forget the beautiful Emma.

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:57.759
- Oh, that's appalling.
- It's wonderful, magnificent.

01:02:57.844 --> 01:03:01.096
- This time we have them at our mercy.
- That's the worst hand we've had.

01:03:01.183 --> 01:03:03.474
I know, but we will bluff them. Smile, just smile.

01:03:03.562 --> 01:03:05.473
Fortunately, they don't understand us.

01:03:05.565 --> 01:03:08.105
- Possiamo cominciare, Signora?
- Qual è la posta?

01:03:08.194 --> 01:03:09.570
- Il doppio.
- Il doppio.

01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:12.693
- But we haven't a chance.
- We shall in a minute. Smile.

01:03:12.785 --> 01:03:15.456
- The seven of diamonds.
- The ace of diamonds.

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.580
There, you see.

01:03:17.668 --> 01:03:19.710
The queen of clubs.

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:23.167
- But that's mad...
- Treble the stakes! Triplichiamo la posta.

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.883
- But, darling...
- The king of spades.

01:03:27.225 --> 01:03:29.267
The seven of diamonds.

01:03:29.354 --> 01:03:31.313
And the ace of hearts.

01:03:31.399 --> 01:03:33.441
E bene, signori, a mio parere.

01:03:33.528 --> 01:03:36.946
- Molta fortunata, signora.
- Bravissimo, signora.

01:03:37.034 --> 01:03:40.487
By gad, you're impudent. What would
you have done if the bluff had failed?

01:03:40.581 --> 01:03:43.667
I would have fainted and upset the table.
Now let us go.

01:03:43.752 --> 01:03:46.708
We can't go. We must give them a chance
to retrieve their losses.

01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:49.125
Would they give you a chance? No, come along.

01:03:49.219 --> 01:03:54.181
I'll order the carriage and we'll drive home
by the sea. The air in here is unbearable.

01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:56.431
Arrividerci, signori. Bon soir, monsieur.

01:03:56.525 --> 01:03:58.185
In a minute.

01:04:05.246 --> 01:04:08.617
Emma, there's a matter of some importance
that I must speak to you about.

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:10.751
Yes, William.

01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:13.711
Ten days ago,
a dispatch came from the Admiralty,

01:04:13.802 --> 01:04:17.386
instructing Nelson in very definite terms
to report in London at once.

01:04:17.474 --> 01:04:19.516
What is all this to do with me?

01:04:19.603 --> 01:04:23.140
Well, if Nelson ignores this final order,
there can be only one result.

01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:26.107
Dismissal from the Navy
and the end of his career.

01:04:26.198 --> 01:04:30.281
ls it worth it, Emma?
His future is in your hands, you know that.

01:04:33.084 --> 01:04:37.546
Very well. If we must go back, we must go back.

01:04:37.631 --> 01:04:41.168
I'll tell him tonight.
When do you wish us to leave?

01:04:41.262 --> 01:04:43.303
We are not going to leave, Emma.

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:48.022
My instructions from the Admiralty say
that Nelson is to return alone.

01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:50.149
Oh, I understand.

01:04:50.237 --> 01:04:53.442
The Admiralty is anxious to save him from me.

01:04:53.534 --> 01:04:55.778
And what am I expected to do?

01:04:55.871 --> 01:05:01.498
It will be convenient, my dear. The Turkish
envoy has invited you to winter in Cairo.

01:05:01.588 --> 01:05:05.803
Tell Nelson that you love Egypt
and that you have accepted the invitation.

01:05:05.888 --> 01:05:09.056
You can be wonderfully convincing
when you try Emma

01:05:09.143 --> 01:05:14.732
The moment you leave for Egypt he will have
no alternative but to obey orders and return

01:05:14.818 --> 01:05:19.482
I know I'm asking you to do a very difficult
and painful duty.

01:05:22.162 --> 01:05:23.790
Thank you, William.

01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:26.035
Well, we both have our duty, haven't we?

01:05:27.172 --> 01:05:29.212
Good luck with yours, my dear.

01:05:56.553 --> 01:05:59.259
Well, I lost everything. I feel better for it.

01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:03.730
What is the matter, my dear?

01:06:03.816 --> 01:06:05.856
William has just been talking to me.

01:06:05.944 --> 01:06:09.445
Telling me of the repeated dispatches
from the Admiralty.

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:12.737
He also wanted me to put on
a little performance for you.

01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:18.339
Act One. Emma Hamilton expresses a sudden
desire to see the Sphinx and the pyramids.

01:06:18.423 --> 01:06:22.340
Act Two. Lord Nelson pleads,
Emma Hamilton remains adamant.

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:25.598
Act Three. Emma Hamilton departs for Egypt.

01:06:25.685 --> 01:06:29.981
And Lord Nelson returns to London
a sadder and wiser man.

01:06:30.067 --> 01:06:35.146
Poor William, he was so serious about it all. I'm
convinced he was only thinking of your career.

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:39.372
He'd been puzzling through all sorts of stories.
What hadn't occurred to him was the truth.

01:06:39.457 --> 01:06:44.418
How silly. How utterly silly.
To think that we should need lies, you and l.

01:06:57.487 --> 01:06:59.281
Oh, my darling.

01:06:59.366 --> 01:07:01.407
What is the truth?

01:07:01.494 --> 01:07:04.698
Should I have put on that comedy for you?

01:07:06.084 --> 01:07:08.837
- It might have helped perhaps.
- Oh, no.

01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:11.496
I cannot put it off any longer.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.304
I must go back this time.

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:18.804
They want me to go alone.

01:07:22.153 --> 01:07:24.193
Oh, of course, you must go.

01:07:25.199 --> 01:07:27.239
And, of course, I must go to Egypt.

01:07:27.327 --> 01:07:29.866
I don't want to be a burden to you, my darling.

01:07:31.041 --> 01:07:33.415
My darling.

01:07:33.504 --> 01:07:39.462
And, of course, I will enjoy seeing the pyramids
and the Sphinx and the Nile.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.382
Your Nile.

01:07:43.019 --> 01:07:45.097
Oh, my darling.

01:07:46.233 --> 01:07:49.105
Why do we always meet just to say goodbye?

01:07:53.579 --> 01:08:00.250
? At home I left a lovely maiden

01:08:00.339 --> 01:08:08.638
? With rosy cheeks and eyes of ocean blue

01:08:08.729 --> 01:08:17.073
? And though my heart is sad and heavy laden

01:08:18.076 --> 01:08:27.835
? To leave a lass I love so fond and true

01:08:31.599 --> 01:08:33.640
What are those bells?

01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:37.140
Have you forgotten what night this is?

01:08:38.152 --> 01:08:40.192
The last of 1799.

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:44.612
Eight bells for the old year
and eight for the new.

01:08:46.499 --> 01:08:48.540
Happy New Year, darling.

01:08:48.627 --> 01:08:51.037
apby New Yea r

01:08:51.131 --> 01:08:53.171
The dawn of a new century.

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:55.299
1 800.

01:08:55.386 --> 01:08:57.926
How strange it sounds.

01:08:59.018 --> 01:09:01.059
What a century it's been.

01:09:03.192 --> 01:09:07.524
Marlborough rode to war
and Washington crossed the Delaware.

01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:11.617
Louis XVl and Marie Antoinette.

01:09:12.707 --> 01:09:14.951
The last of the Stuarts.

01:09:15.045 --> 01:09:17.085
Peter The Great.

01:09:17.173 --> 01:09:19.215
Voltaire.

01:09:19.301 --> 01:09:21.343
Clive Of lndia.

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:23.259
Bonaparte.

01:09:24.687 --> 01:09:26.432
Nelson.

01:09:40.711 --> 01:09:44.841
Now I've kissed you through two centuries.

01:09:46.053 --> 01:09:48.095
1 800.

01:09:48.182 --> 01:09:51.305
The beginning of a new life for me.

01:09:51.397 --> 01:09:53.354
A life without you.

01:09:54.819 --> 01:09:57.394
How beautiful was the old century.

01:09:58.617 --> 01:10:00.658
When I was with you.

01:10:08.924 --> 01:10:12.377
Emma, say that you could never leave me.

01:10:12.471 --> 01:10:14.512
I can never leave you.

01:10:14.599 --> 01:10:16.844
Say that you hate the blasted pyramids.

01:10:16.938 --> 01:10:18.434
I hate the pyramids.

01:10:18.525 --> 01:10:20.483
That you never want to see the Sphinx.

01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:22.444
I never want to see the Sphinx.

01:10:22.531 --> 01:10:24.572
We'll go back to London together.

01:10:24.659 --> 01:10:27.745
I would have died if you'd left me here.

01:10:41.563 --> 01:10:43.603
I am Lady Nelson.

01:10:45.026 --> 01:10:47.269
Everything has been prepared
for Your Ladyship.

01:10:47.363 --> 01:10:49.653
Your rooms have been reserved
by the Admiralty.

01:10:49.742 --> 01:10:51.866
Thank you. Kindly show me to my rooms.

01:10:51.954 --> 01:10:55.788
You will find our bed linen in the green trunk.
We prefer our own sheets.

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:59.295
- Very good, Your Ladyship.
- Breakfast precisely at 6:45.

01:10:59.382 --> 01:11:03.845
India tea with lemon, one four-minute egg,
two slices of thinly buttered toast.

01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:06.174
I shall instruct the head waiter, Your Ladyship.

01:11:06.269 --> 01:11:09.474
I dislike waiters in the rooms.
Would you arrange for a chambermaid?

01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:11.606
As you wish...

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:17.820
Here, here. Go and drink a health
to Lord Nelson my son.

01:11:17.913 --> 01:11:20.038
Thank you, sir. I will and be proud to.

01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:25.086
I am deeply honoured to have you with us
on this great occasion, sir.

01:11:25.174 --> 01:11:28.296
You are the guest of the British Admiralty,
Mr Nelson.

01:11:28.388 --> 01:11:31.843
Good, then charge up a glass of port
to the British Admiralty.

01:11:31.937 --> 01:11:34.856
And let's have it right away.
Anything for you, my dear?

01:11:34.941 --> 01:11:39.985
No, thank you. One small glass of light port
for Mr Nelson and a warming pan for his bed.

01:11:40.074 --> 01:11:42.115
Very good, Your Ladyship.

01:11:42.202 --> 01:11:45.539
Wonderful! Wonderful! Lap of luxury.

01:11:45.625 --> 01:11:48.628
No morning service and no chickens to feed.

01:11:48.713 --> 01:11:51.289
Let's have breakfast in bed with two eggs, eh?

01:11:51.385 --> 01:11:53.260
I've arranged everything, Father.

01:11:53.346 --> 01:11:56.099
It's unwise to break good habits even in London.

01:11:56.184 --> 01:11:59.056
You must remember Dr Ponsonby's words
of advice.

01:11:59.147 --> 01:12:01.187
Dr Ponsonby's advice.

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:04.562
Did Dr Ponsonby's son ever sink
the French fleet?

01:12:04.655 --> 01:12:07.528
- We're going to enjoy ourselves.

01:12:07.619 --> 01:12:11.916
Your Ladyship, Lord Spencer is here
and wishes to be received.

01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:14.043
Very well.

01:12:25.983 --> 01:12:28.024
Good morning, Lady Nelson.

01:12:28.112 --> 01:12:31.280
The Admiralty appreciates
your prompt response to its request.

01:12:31.367 --> 01:12:34.038
I hope your accommodation is comfortable.

01:12:34.121 --> 01:12:35.866
Quite, Lord Spencer, thank you.

01:12:35.956 --> 01:12:37.997
- Pray, be seated.
- Thank you.

01:12:38.085 --> 01:12:41.040
I assume that the Admiralty desires
my presence

01:12:41.131 --> 01:12:45.001
to discuss the arrangements for my husband's
reception. When does he arrive?

01:12:45.096 --> 01:12:47.768
He's already arrived, Lady Nelson.

01:12:49.062 --> 01:12:50.262
What?

01:12:50.357 --> 01:12:54.689
It was Lord Nelson's special wish
that his arrival should not be made public.

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:57.866
Did he include his wife in the term ''public''?

01:12:57.952 --> 01:13:01.572
I don't recall the exact phraseology of the letter.

01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:05.619
However, the Admiralty thought it advisable to
accede to his request.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:08.254
So he arrived at Great Yarmouth yesterday

01:13:08.344 --> 01:13:11.097
I was not aware
that Great Yarmouth is a naval port.

01:13:11.181 --> 01:13:14.220
He travelled on the mail packet from Hamburg.

01:13:14.312 --> 01:13:15.807
lsn't that peculiar?

01:13:15.898 --> 01:13:19.648
I should have supposed that a victorious admiral
would arrive on his flagship.

01:13:19.737 --> 01:13:22.491
Flagship? Oh, er...

01:13:23.661 --> 01:13:28.325
It is not customary as you know
for ladies to travel on battleships

01:13:29.419 --> 01:13:30.914
See.

01:13:33.592 --> 01:13:38.258
I wondered why the Admiralty had decided
not to give my husband an official reception.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:40.892
Now I understand and fully agree.

01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:45.148
The programme for Lord Nelson's stay
in London will be a simple one.

01:13:45.239 --> 01:13:49.025
He should be able to leave for his home
in Norfolk the day after tomorrow,

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.744
even tomorrow night.

01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:54.081
Do I understand that my husband will be forced
to resign from the Navy?

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:56.707
Oh, no, no, no, no, Lady Nelson.

01:13:56.797 --> 01:13:59.124
Hardly as drastic as that.

01:13:59.218 --> 01:14:04.262
Extended leave for the benefit of his health
will be suggested.

01:14:04.352 --> 01:14:06.393
A matter of different words.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.685
That's what you mean, isn't it? I'm glad.

01:14:09.777 --> 01:14:12.270
You were quite right
to spare the people of London.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:18.206
The indignity of feting a hero who treats
with contempt the most sacred rules of life.

01:14:20.338 --> 01:14:22.912
May I say a personal word?

01:14:23.008 --> 01:14:26.296
Try to be forgiving, Lady Nelson.

01:14:26.388 --> 01:14:31.267
Only the weaknesses of the great are glaring.

01:14:34.025 --> 01:14:36.067
I prefer the official view.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:41.403
Goodbye, Lady Nelson.

01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:45.250
Did you hear it? Cheering.

01:14:45.336 --> 01:14:48.089
Listen. He's coming! He's coming!

01:14:48.173 --> 01:14:53.004
Excuse me, sir. May I have your permission
to hang a flag in the balcony?

01:14:53.098 --> 01:14:56.186
Hang two flags, three flags,
everything you've got.

01:14:56.271 --> 01:15:00.520
Come on! Come on!
Hang the coat of arms between the flags!

01:15:00.611 --> 01:15:05.691
Most opportune, sir. We saved the coat of arms
from King George's jubilee!

01:15:05.785 --> 01:15:08.788
Do you realise
that these are my private rooms, sir?

01:15:08.873 --> 01:15:11.912
Forgive me, Your Ladyship.
I had no idea this would happen.

01:15:12.004 --> 01:15:16.420
The Admiralty told me that Lord Nelson's return
would be private and without demonstration.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:20.381
We never dreamed that the public would
take the matter so completely in hand.

01:15:20.476 --> 01:15:23.480
Has the government no control
over this vulgar demonstration?

01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:27.019
No, ma'am. The vulgar demonstration
has control over the government.

01:15:27.112 --> 01:15:29.153
MR NELSON: Bravo for Nelson! Bravo!

01:15:29.241 --> 01:15:33.823
I must get back to the Admiralty,
hang out all the flags we've got.

01:15:33.915 --> 01:15:35.576
Listen, church bells.

01:15:35.668 --> 01:15:38.588
Victory bells for my son.

01:15:41.343 --> 01:15:43.384
Here they are!

01:15:49.191 --> 01:15:52.812
Mr Nelson, my name is Hamilton.

01:15:52.905 --> 01:15:56.407
Oh, my son's good friend.
He's often told me about you in his letters.

01:15:56.494 --> 01:15:59.117
You're to be congratulated.
You have a great son.

01:15:59.207 --> 01:16:02.209
Lady Nelson, I am delighted to meet you.

01:16:02.295 --> 01:16:06.674
We had the privilege of joining your husband
in his triumphant procession across Europe.

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.512
It was overwhelming and quite exhausting,
I'm afraid, for an old man.

01:16:10.601 --> 01:16:15.350
My wife was in her element. She swallows
a triumph like a penguin swallows a herring.

01:16:15.443 --> 01:16:17.435
Did you have a good crossing, Sir William?

01:16:17.528 --> 01:16:21.148
Quite rough, I'm afraid. Everyone was seasick
and I was sicker than them all.

01:16:21.242 --> 01:16:24.198
I made the mistake of trying
to ward it off with pills.

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:27.909
- Oh dear dear
- What's the good of trying to fight the elements?

01:16:28.003 --> 01:16:30.461
It's far more sensible, is it not, Lady Nelson,

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:33.007
and so much easier to accept their victory

01:16:33.095 --> 01:16:37.144
whether those elements be around us
or within us

01:16:38.272 --> 01:16:42.224
I hope we shall have the pleasure
of seeing your frequently, Lady Nelson.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.525
He's coming! Nelson! Nelson!

01:16:45.617 --> 01:16:47.658
Bravo for Nelson!

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.116
My boy!

01:16:51.918 --> 01:16:55.335
How proud your mother would be
if she could see you this day.

01:16:55.423 --> 01:16:57.630
How have you been all these years, Father?

01:16:57.718 --> 01:17:00.507
First rate. Fanny's taken great care of me.

01:17:03.771 --> 01:17:05.599
I'm sure she has.

01:17:09.071 --> 01:17:11.445
There is so much I have to be grateful to you for.

01:17:12.744 --> 01:17:14.785
How are you, my dear?

01:17:14.873 --> 01:17:16.701
I'm very well.

01:17:22.928 --> 01:17:24.589
And how is Burnham Thorpe?

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.389
They've named a street after us.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.935
What an honour.

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.512
Are these Lord Nelson's rooms?

01:17:30.607 --> 01:17:32.350
Yes milady

01:17:32.442 --> 01:17:36.229
It was magnificent, stupendous.
Wasn't it wonderful, William?

01:17:36.324 --> 01:17:40.372
They're wild with enthusiasm.
Come to the balcony! Quickly Quickly!

01:17:55.897 --> 01:17:58.272
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.150
? For he's a jolly good fellow

01:18:01.241 --> 01:18:04.113
? For he's a jolly good fellow

01:18:04.204 --> 01:18:06.115
? And so say all of us

01:18:06.583 --> 01:18:08.540
? And so say all of us

01:18:09.044 --> 01:18:11.584
? And so say all of us

01:18:11.673 --> 01:18:14.248
? For he's a jolly good fellow

01:18:14.344 --> 01:18:16.551
? And so say all of us

01:18:17.057 --> 01:18:19.218
? And so say all of us

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:22.400
? And so say all of us

01:18:22.483 --> 01:18:25.106
? For he's a jolly good fellow

01:18:25.196 --> 01:18:26.441
Lady Nelson...

01:18:26.531 --> 01:18:28.156
? And so say all of us

01:18:28.242 --> 01:18:29.867
I am Emma Hamilton.

01:18:29.953 --> 01:18:34.001
Hooray! Hip hip hooray!

01:18:34.085 --> 01:18:35.546
Hip hip hooray!

01:18:36.047 --> 01:18:38.622
Hip hip hooray!

01:18:39.135 --> 01:18:41.593
Hip hip hooray!

01:18:54.703 --> 01:18:56.743
Well, it's been a great day.

01:18:56.831 --> 01:18:58.741
A wonderful day.

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:02.287
And next month,
it's the choirboys' picnic at Burnham Thorpe.

01:19:02.381 --> 01:19:05.503
Why do you laugh?

01:19:05.595 --> 01:19:08.551
Are the places of country people
of so small account?

01:19:08.641 --> 01:19:12.595
A little more wholesome I think
than the mass hysteria we've seen today

01:19:12.691 --> 01:19:16.109
Well, call it what you like.
It was a beautiful reception.

01:19:16.197 --> 01:19:20.493
You wouldn't believe the fuss
they made about him at Naples after the battle

01:19:20.578 --> 01:19:24.162
Whoo! Such crowds. Thousands of Italians.

01:19:24.249 --> 01:19:26.707
All smelling of different sorts of onions.

01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:28.837
Onions?

01:19:28.924 --> 01:19:33.923
Yes, they always do. I don't know why,
it comes out more when they get excited.

01:19:34.017 --> 01:19:37.471
There was such a crowd round the embassy
the milkman couldn't get in

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:40.354
So His Lordship had to go
without his macaroni pudding.

01:19:40.445 --> 01:19:41.904
LADY NELSON: His what?

01:19:41.989 --> 01:19:47.412
My Emma put him on macaroni pudding
to fatten him up after the battle.

01:19:47.497 --> 01:19:50.287
Did you ever meet the King of Naples,
Mrs Nelson?

01:19:51.379 --> 01:19:53.419
He was a one for macaroni.

01:19:53.507 --> 01:19:57.174
He'd take pieces that length,
open his gullet and drop it in.

01:19:57.263 --> 01:19:59.255
Proper caution, he was

01:19:59.348 --> 01:20:02.519
He came to see Emma with the Queen one day
and he pinched my...

01:20:02.605 --> 01:20:04.100
He pinched me.

01:20:04.191 --> 01:20:06.315
He pinched you? The King?

01:20:06.403 --> 01:20:09.111
Well, you see, he's a foreigner, poor King.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:14.874
He got so jealous when they cheered
His Lordship because he loved it so himself.

01:20:15.752 --> 01:20:20.749
If you shouted outside his palace,
he'd come in and out like a cuckoo clock.

01:20:20.843 --> 01:20:25.057
Emma... Emma, who was that other king
we met on the way home?

01:20:25.141 --> 01:20:28.348
You know,
I get so mixed up with all these monarchs.

01:20:30.777 --> 01:20:33.983
Oh, dear, Emma. Will you excuse me, dear?
I've been up since five.

01:20:34.074 --> 01:20:36.744
Of course, Mother, darling. Good night.

01:20:36.828 --> 01:20:41.159
Oh, it's good to be back in England again
to hear the Bow Bells and the muffin men

01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:43.494
and the soot falling down your chimney.

01:20:52.687 --> 01:20:55.690
Well Sir William
how goes the world these days?

01:20:55.776 --> 01:20:58.185
Can we hope for a little peace now?

01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.905
Well, I don't know.

01:20:59.991 --> 01:21:02.780
What was that medicine you gave my husband?

01:21:02.871 --> 01:21:06.788
It's some stuff my mother makes.
It's very good for coughs and colds.

01:21:06.878 --> 01:21:09.667
I think I would prefer my husband
to see a doctor.

01:21:10.759 --> 01:21:12.799
This weather is dreadful for him.

01:21:12.886 --> 01:21:16.721
It was so different in Italy.
The sun always seemed to shine there.

01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:20.346
Yes, it's never very agreeable
in the Thames Valley during the winter.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:24.655
It's only for a few days. Once he's back
in Norfolk, he'll be a different man.

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.314
Do you think
you will be leaving London so soon?

01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:29.785
Certainly. There's nothing to detain us.

01:21:29.873 --> 01:21:34.336
Directly he's made his report to the Admiralty
and taken his seat in the House of Lords,

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:35.833
we shall be free to go.

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:37.468
Why not?

01:21:37.553 --> 01:21:39.593
Oh...of course, yes.

01:21:39.681 --> 01:21:41.722
What are your plans, Lady Hamilton?

01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:44.434
I suppose you'll be going abroad again shortly?

01:21:44.523 --> 01:21:48.570
We don't really know.
Life is so very uncertain, isn't it?

01:21:48.655 --> 01:21:50.694
I haven't found it so.

01:21:52.409 --> 01:21:56.326
Will you excuse me, Lady Hamilton?
It's been a very exhausting day.

01:21:56.415 --> 01:21:58.576
- Of course. Good night.
- Good night.

01:22:12.735 --> 01:22:14.194
Emma.

01:22:16.992 --> 01:22:19.033
We've been living in a dream.

01:22:20.122 --> 01:22:23.790
And now we are faced with the truth,
how ugly it is.

01:22:23.879 --> 01:22:25.374
How terribly ugly.

01:22:25.464 --> 01:22:27.790
But we've still got the courage to face it.

01:22:27.884 --> 01:22:30.460
What's the good of being courageous
if you're trapped?

01:22:30.555 --> 01:22:32.929
If you know you are wrong
and there's no way out.

01:22:34.646 --> 01:22:38.729
I'll go to her and talk to her. Tonight. At once.

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.359
And you must talk to William.

01:22:41.449 --> 01:22:43.490
They must understand

01:22:43.577 --> 01:22:45.618
- Divorce?
- There is no other way

01:22:45.705 --> 01:22:47.331
No, m y ove

01:22:47.416 --> 01:22:50.704
That might be well enough for other people,
but not for you.

01:22:50.796 --> 01:22:55.177
You are not an ordinary man and you cannot
behave like a Mr Jones or a Mr Thompson.

01:22:55.263 --> 01:22:57.303
I wish I were a Mr Thompson.

01:22:57.392 --> 01:23:01.309
Now, for the first time,
I begin to understand what William meant.

01:23:01.399 --> 01:23:03.807
What we're doing is so dreadfully wrong.

01:23:03.902 --> 01:23:06.525
Of course, I should have realised it before.

01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:09.701
And because it is wrong,
it cannot bring happiness.

01:23:11.623 --> 01:23:13.664
Those streets we came along today.

01:23:13.752 --> 01:23:18.831
They're the very same streets I walked through
when I was a kitchen maid looking for work,

01:23:18.926 --> 01:23:21.680
but, today, they were the scene of your triumph,

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:24.803
the triumph of our greatest man
coming to his home.

01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.601
They have made you the symbol
of all that is most precious to them.

01:23:29.695 --> 01:23:32.366
Whatever you do
will be their guide and example.

01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:34.693
You will not speak to your wife

01:23:34.787 --> 01:23:37.196
and I shall not speak to William.

01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:45.293
I'm cold!

01:23:45.385 --> 01:23:47.545
I'm freezing. I'm frightened!

01:23:47.639 --> 01:23:50.312
Emma! Somebody will hear you.

01:23:50.396 --> 01:23:52.436
Ssh, Emma!

01:23:52.524 --> 01:23:54.352
Dear, Emma, ssh!

01:23:55.445 --> 01:23:59.148
Is this better?
Lowered voices? Stolen meetings?

01:24:00.245 --> 01:24:02.916
Darkness, suspicion, lies, more lies?

01:24:04.418 --> 01:24:06.459
Is this what has become of it?

01:24:06.546 --> 01:24:08.588
All that beauty

01:24:08.675 --> 01:24:10.918
and light and glory?

01:24:14.852 --> 01:24:17.094
Good night, my dearest love.

01:24:21.737 --> 01:24:23.362
Good night.

01:24:40.728 --> 01:24:42.768
I, my lords,

01:24:42.856 --> 01:24:45.646
have, in different countries,

01:24:45.736 --> 01:24:48.822
seen much of the miseries of war.

01:24:49.993 --> 01:24:52.034
I am, therefore,

01:24:52.121 --> 01:24:54.161
in my innermost soul...

01:24:55.293 --> 01:24:57.333
..a man of peace.

01:24:58.673 --> 01:25:02.970
Yet I would not, for the sake of any peace,

01:25:03.055 --> 01:25:05.464
however fortunate,

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:08.099
consent to sacrifice

01:25:08.189 --> 01:25:11.892
one jot of England's honour.

01:25:11.987 --> 01:25:13.814
Hitherto

01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:17.954
there has been nothing greater known
on the continent

01:25:18.038 --> 01:25:20.079
than the faith

01:25:20.167 --> 01:25:22.541
the untainted honour

01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:26.132
the generous public sympathies

01:25:26.219 --> 01:25:28.794
the high diplomatic influence,

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:30.930
the commerce,

01:25:31.017 --> 01:25:33.059
the grandeur,

01:25:33.147 --> 01:25:35.187
the irresistible power,

01:25:35.275 --> 01:25:38.776
the unconquerable valour of the British nation.

01:25:42.078 --> 01:25:45.579
He's nervous.
Look. Look at his hand. He's trembling.

01:25:45.667 --> 01:25:50.331
It's nerve-racking for any man
to come into the House of Lords for the first time.

01:25:50.424 --> 01:25:54.045
It will be more nerve-racking
for the poor man when he goes out.

01:25:54.139 --> 01:25:55.966
Why?

01:25:56.058 --> 01:25:58.101
There is that Hamilton woman.

01:25:58.189 --> 01:26:01.774
peace or war no interest

01:26:02.947 --> 01:26:05.404
And, don't look now, his wife.

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:10.623
and as the nation was pleased
with the sincere spirit of peace

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:14.754
It will be a thrilling moment
when he goes into the vestibule.

01:26:14.839 --> 01:26:18.175
I can hardly wait
to see which one he goes to first.

01:26:18.262 --> 01:26:19.887
Her?

01:26:19.972 --> 01:26:22.014
Or her?

01:26:36.292 --> 01:26:38.167
Here he comes.

01:27:00.498 --> 01:27:02.575
My dear, were you comfortable up there?

01:27:02.668 --> 01:27:04.792
Sufficiently, Horatio. Sufficiently.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.419
- Did you hear my speech?
- For the most part.

01:27:07.509 --> 01:27:11.010
You have a way of overemphasising,
which is rather embarrassing.

01:27:11.098 --> 01:27:13.140
- Oh.
- It was quite interesting.

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.723
Lady Keith.

01:27:14.814 --> 01:27:16.308
Lady Spencer.

01:27:16.399 --> 01:27:18.025
Lady Hamilton.

01:27:24.829 --> 01:27:26.869
WOMAN: Why, what's the matter?

01:27:26.957 --> 01:27:30.460
GENTLEMAN: Stand back please! Give her air!
- What was that?

01:27:30.548 --> 01:27:32.755
- It's Lady Hamilton!
- Stand back please!

01:27:32.843 --> 01:27:34.967
Wait, Frances, please.

01:27:35.054 --> 01:27:37.297
- Will you fetch a doctor?
- Immediately.

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.348
Make way, please

01:27:40.439 --> 01:27:42.646
- What's happened?
- I told her not to come.

01:27:42.734 --> 01:27:44.562
She's not been feeling well all day.

01:27:44.653 --> 01:27:46.564
N SO N W here s the doctor?

01:27:46.656 --> 01:27:48.484
But why should she faint?

01:27:48.576 --> 01:27:51.367
My dear, it's natural to women of all classes.

01:27:51.457 --> 01:27:53.083
Drive on!

01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:58.748
Well?

01:27:58.843 --> 01:28:03.258
Frances, how could you drive away like that,
without making the slightest effort to help?

01:28:03.349 --> 01:28:05.558
Did you expect me to take her into my carriage,

01:28:05.645 --> 01:28:08.768
just because she selects the House of Lords
for her melodrama?

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:12.907
When people have been kind to me and
generous, don't ignore them when they're ill.

01:28:12.992 --> 01:28:15.365
- Even in the House of Lords.
- Generous? Ha ha!

01:28:15.454 --> 01:28:18.077
It is well known that what success
I may have achieved

01:28:18.166 --> 01:28:21.503
has been largely due
to the help I have received from the Hamiltons.

01:28:21.589 --> 01:28:24.046
- Why are you so ungrateful?
- Why are you so blind?

01:28:24.135 --> 01:28:26.176
Don't you see what that woman is after?

01:28:26.264 --> 01:28:30.347
It's the oldest story in the world,
the most sordid and the most contemptible.

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:34.568
Find a public hero and there you'll find,
as sure as fate, a woman parasite.

01:28:34.653 --> 01:28:38.105
Don't you realise that all she wants
is to flutter about in your glory,

01:28:38.199 --> 01:28:40.323
to use you for her own ambition and conceit?

01:28:40.410 --> 01:28:42.903
Oh, I know, she helped you,
she encouraged you.

01:28:42.998 --> 01:28:45.705
Why, it was part of her plan
to play upon your vanity.

01:28:45.795 --> 01:28:48.417
She's capable of declaring you
the father of her child.

01:28:48.507 --> 01:28:50.549
- Frances, control yourself!
- Why not?

01:28:50.636 --> 01:28:52.963
Even that accusation stirs some men's vanities.

01:28:53.057 --> 01:28:54.053
Silence!

01:28:54.142 --> 01:28:56.718
Oh, yes, everyone says
she's a wonderful actress.

01:28:56.814 --> 01:29:00.232
She is brilliant, to have hidden
her sweet secret for so long.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.652
The other day, you remarked upon
the new fashions, all these frills and folds.

01:29:04.744 --> 01:29:07.830
She invented them and all society followed.

01:29:07.915 --> 01:29:11.203
Wonderful to lead society into helping her
through a predicament.

01:29:11.296 --> 01:29:15.294
You fool! Don't you realise everything she does
is calculated and cold-blooded?

01:29:15.384 --> 01:29:17.842
She faints in the House of Lords,
a perfect place.

01:29:17.931 --> 01:29:21.303
Do you suppose she'd have wasted time
in fainting in her own bedroom?

01:29:21.396 --> 01:29:23.224
You poor silly man!

01:29:24.735 --> 01:29:26.562
Poor and silly?

01:29:27.656 --> 01:29:29.982
Yes, that is what I am without her.

01:29:30.076 --> 01:29:32.568
I'm a peer of England because of her.

01:29:32.663 --> 01:29:35.202
And because of her, I'm Lady Nelson.

01:29:36.294 --> 01:29:38.537
Lady Nelson? Ha!

01:29:38.631 --> 01:29:40.673
What an honour!

01:29:40.761 --> 01:29:45.259
They point after my coach, point up
at my windows, point at me in the streets.

01:29:45.351 --> 01:29:47.928
There's a coarse joke about me in the taverns.

01:29:48.024 --> 01:29:50.562
A foul song about me on the Limehouse barges.

01:29:50.652 --> 01:29:52.480
Lady Nelson!

01:29:52.571 --> 01:29:54.197
How funny!

01:29:54.282 --> 01:29:56.110
How pitiful!

01:29:57.203 --> 01:29:59.245
And how proud I might have been.

01:30:00.710 --> 01:30:02.869
I'm sorry, Frances.

01:30:04.173 --> 01:30:05.799
Sorry?

01:30:05.884 --> 01:30:07.925
Is that all you have to give me?

01:30:09.097 --> 01:30:11.769
Yes. That is all.

01:30:11.853 --> 01:30:13.680
Very well.

01:30:13.772 --> 01:30:17.477
I shall take that as your answer
and now you shall have mine.

01:30:17.572 --> 01:30:19.399
I shall go away,

01:30:19.491 --> 01:30:23.621
but I shall never drag the name of Nelson
through the divorce court.

01:30:23.707 --> 01:30:26.245
As long as I live, I shall be your wife.

01:30:26.335 --> 01:30:27.960
Goodbye.

01:30:39.148 --> 01:30:41.391
Horatio, call her back.

01:30:41.485 --> 01:30:44.191
I implore you, call her back.

01:30:44.281 --> 01:30:46.821
You mustn't let her go like this.

01:30:48.455 --> 01:30:51.077
I couldn't help hearing what you said, Horatio.

01:30:51.167 --> 01:30:52.792
Please, Father,

01:30:52.878 --> 01:30:54.920
try to understand.

01:30:55.007 --> 01:30:57.048
do, m y boy, do

01:30:57.135 --> 01:31:01.598
I know I'm a silly old man, a humble
country parson, and I don't know the world,

01:31:01.685 --> 01:31:05.102
except the little people who come to me with
their little troubles,

01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:09.771
but even those little people sometimes
have to fight in the depths of their soul,

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:13.781
the same temptations as you,
the great of the world.

01:31:13.871 --> 01:31:17.207
And, when they have to choose
between right and wrong,

01:31:17.294 --> 01:31:20.296
I give them the same advice
as I give to you now.

01:31:20.382 --> 01:31:25.177
Even if it forces all three of us
to live in misery for the rest of our lives?

01:31:25.264 --> 01:31:27.092
Even so.

01:31:28.186 --> 01:31:30.347
That is something I cannot do, Father.

01:31:32.235 --> 01:31:34.276
Then I shall go with her, Horatio.

01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:40.910
What s the name off the child?

01:31:40.997 --> 01:31:43.038
Horatia Thompson.

01:31:44.546 --> 01:31:46.586
Her father's name?

01:31:46.674 --> 01:31:48.715
Horatio Thompson.

01:31:52.561 --> 01:31:54.804
- Profession?
- Sailor.

01:31:57.986 --> 01:31:59.813
Where is he now?

01:31:59.905 --> 01:32:01.530
At sea.

01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.260
- Emily!
- Mother, darling!

01:32:16.348 --> 01:32:18.473
- Are you well?
- Yes. How's the baby?

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.311
I wish you could see her. She's an angel.
Not at all like a child of two months.

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.060
She's like a little princess.

01:32:24.152 --> 01:32:28.449
I wish you could see the way she receives
her bottle and then indicates the meal is over.

01:32:28.535 --> 01:32:30.908
- You'd adore her.
- What does she weigh now?

01:32:30.997 --> 01:32:33.204
9lb 4oz, before her second bottle.

01:32:33.292 --> 01:32:35.369
- The news, isn't it splendid?
- What news?

01:32:35.463 --> 01:32:37.836
- Haven't you heard?
- I haven't been out

01:32:37.925 --> 01:32:42.340
He's done it again. He's beaten the Danes.
It's a glorious victory!

01:32:42.432 --> 01:32:45.603
Nelson was in the front line of battle,
ahead of the main fleet.

01:32:45.690 --> 01:32:49.440
His commander in chief saw the enemy
outnumbered us by more than two to one.

01:32:49.529 --> 01:32:52.816
He sent off a signal to Nelson
telling him to give up and withdraw.

01:32:52.909 --> 01:32:56.742
Do you know what Nelson did?
When the signal was pointed out to him,

01:32:56.831 --> 01:33:01.828
he put a telescope to his blind eye, said, ''I'm
darned if I can see it'', went on fighting and won.

01:33:01.922 --> 01:33:07.216
There, you see, everything comes in handy,
if you know how to use it, even a blind eye!

01:33:10.437 --> 01:33:12.645
How's William, Mother?

01:33:12.733 --> 01:33:16.483
I have some news, too, Emma,
but not so good as yours.

01:33:16.572 --> 01:33:21.737
All his treasures, pictures, everything, he's
waited for them to come from Naples for so long.

01:33:21.832 --> 01:33:26.377
Now, we know for certain they all went down
in the ship that was lost in the storm.

01:33:26.464 --> 01:33:29.834
Oh, poor William. That was his whole life.

01:33:31.011 --> 01:33:32.637
Gavin,

01:33:32.722 --> 01:33:34.764
that picture, there,

01:33:34.852 --> 01:33:36.726
the Van Dyck.

01:33:36.813 --> 01:33:38.853
It's crooked, don't you see?

01:33:39.944 --> 01:33:42.069
I've told you about it twice already.

01:33:42.156 --> 01:33:45.112
- Why don't you put it straight?
- Yes, Sir William.

01:33:51.838 --> 01:33:53.878
- Here, sir?
- Yes.

01:33:55.593 --> 01:33:57.219
That's good.

01:33:57.304 --> 01:33:58.931
Good, Gavin.

01:34:00.019 --> 01:34:02.807
It's good to have my pictures
around me once more

01:34:02.898 --> 01:34:04.940
and my statues.

01:34:05.027 --> 01:34:08.444
But they... They need more light, more room.

01:34:08.532 --> 01:34:10.859
We must rearrange them, Gavin.

01:34:16.879 --> 01:34:18.707
Gavin...

01:34:18.799 --> 01:34:21.671
I'll dine with Miss Hart tonight.

01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:23.387
Alone.

01:34:23.473 --> 01:34:25.514
At eight o'clock.

01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:33.946
Look after yourself.
Talk to Sir William before it's too late.

01:34:34.031 --> 01:34:37.653
Or the house itseIf will go to his nephew
instead of to his wife.

01:34:37.746 --> 01:34:40.619
His wife?
Why, I have never been his wife, Mother.

01:34:40.710 --> 01:34:42.751
Let Charles have the money.

01:34:42.838 --> 01:34:45.211
I don't want it and I don't deserve it.

01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:50.643
But, my darling, if things stay as they are,
you won't have a penny when he dies.

01:34:50.726 --> 01:34:52.767
You'll be poor!

01:34:52.856 --> 01:34:54.896
I shall be rich.

01:34:54.984 --> 01:34:57.856
I've got my child, his child.

01:34:57.947 --> 01:35:01.364
I think that means more
than all the money in the world.

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:09.416
- Can I see Sir William now, Gavin?
- I don't think it's advisable, milady.

01:35:09.507 --> 01:35:12.380
He's sleeping, very peacefully.

01:35:26.784 --> 01:35:29.656
Gentlemen, the victor of Copenhagen!

01:35:29.748 --> 01:35:31.789
Bravo, Nelson!

01:35:38.262 --> 01:35:44.056
Lord Nelson, your decisive defeat of the Danes
has made it possible for the British Government

01:35:44.148 --> 01:35:49.193
to negotiate this honourable
and, I must say, unexpected peace with France.

01:35:49.281 --> 01:35:52.984
We all believe, with the deepest conviction,

01:35:53.079 --> 01:35:55.915
that we shall have, at last, peace.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.039
ALL: Hear, hear!

01:35:59.838 --> 01:36:01.713
Lord Spencer,

01:36:01.799 --> 01:36:03.425
gentlemen...

01:36:04.595 --> 01:36:09.227
..you are celebrating a peace
with Napoleon Bonaparte.

01:36:10.899 --> 01:36:12.940
''Peace'' is a very beautiful word,

01:36:13.028 --> 01:36:15.486
as long as the impulse of peace is behind it,

01:36:15.574 --> 01:36:18.113
but you will never make peace with Napoleon.

01:36:18.203 --> 01:36:20.244
He doesn't mean peace, today.

01:36:21.333 --> 01:36:23.659
He just wants to gain a little time...

01:36:24.755 --> 01:36:26.796
..to rearm himseIf at sea

01:36:26.884 --> 01:36:30.586
and make new alliances with Italy and Spain,
all to one purpose.

01:36:30.681 --> 01:36:33.305
To destroy our empire!

01:36:33.395 --> 01:36:36.681
Years ago, I said the same thing at Naples.

01:36:36.774 --> 01:36:41.523
I begged them, entreated them, not to give way,
but they wouldn't listen to me and paid the price.

01:36:41.616 --> 01:36:46.577
That was a little kingdom,
miles away in the Mediterranean.

01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:51.588
But now it is England, our own land.

01:36:52.675 --> 01:36:56.176
Napoleon can never be master of the world
until he has smashed us up

01:36:56.264 --> 01:36:59.601
and, believe me, gentlemen,
he means to be master of the world!

01:36:59.688 --> 01:37:01.847
You cannot make peace with dictators.

01:37:01.942 --> 01:37:04.315
You have to destroy them, wipe them out!

01:37:04.404 --> 01:37:08.452
Gentlemen, I implore you,
speak to the Prime Minister before it is too late!

01:37:08.536 --> 01:37:10.577
Do not ratify this peace!

01:37:11.665 --> 01:37:14.584
We, er, appreciate all you say.

01:37:14.670 --> 01:37:19.049
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
I feIt it my duty to tell you of these things.

01:37:19.135 --> 01:37:21.593
I'm not a statesman, of course.

01:37:21.681 --> 01:37:23.723
I'm no diplomat.

01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:26.100
I must leave it in your hands.

01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:28.266
- Gentlemen.
- Good day, Lord Nelson.

01:37:31.489 --> 01:37:34.942
Going to your, er, home in Norfolk, Nelson?

01:37:35.036 --> 01:37:37.077
I don't... I don't think so.

01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:41.456
My wife tells me
she saw Lady Nelson at Bath, recently.

01:37:41.548 --> 01:37:43.589
Yes. She's very well.

01:37:43.677 --> 01:37:46.216
She gives her time to social work.

01:37:46.306 --> 01:37:49.178
Ah. And er...shall you go to Venice?

01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:52.311
Er... Why Venice?

01:37:52.398 --> 01:37:54.891
Oh, something I heard the other day.

01:37:54.986 --> 01:37:59.984
A little party to some musical festival,
Lady Hamilton and a few English friends.

01:38:01.121 --> 01:38:03.162
Where did you hear this?

01:38:03.249 --> 01:38:07.380
It was that little musical chap,
who came over to Covent Garden to conduct.

01:38:07.465 --> 01:38:11.132
I heard him say something about
Lady Hamilton going back with him

01:38:11.221 --> 01:38:12.846
Oh, well...

01:38:12.932 --> 01:38:15.176
I daresay I've got it all mixed up.

01:38:15.269 --> 01:38:17.597
Well, it's good to see you home again.

01:38:19.986 --> 01:38:22.026
Why, your lordship!

01:38:22.114 --> 01:38:24.155
Good afternoon, Mrs Cadogan.

01:38:24.242 --> 01:38:26.116
Sit down, please.

01:38:26.203 --> 01:38:28.244
Everything is in such a mess.

01:38:28.332 --> 01:38:31.251
Why this sudden move
from Piccadilly to Nero's Hotel?

01:38:31.336 --> 01:38:37.760
Well, you see, everything was so dull and dismal
since William died.

01:38:37.848 --> 01:38:39.890
Emma couldn't stand it any longer.

01:38:39.977 --> 01:38:41.971
see

01:38:42.064 --> 01:38:43.523
Where is she now?

01:38:43.608 --> 01:38:45.649
She went out quite early.

01:38:45.736 --> 01:38:50.614
With the little foreign musical gentleman.
They're... They're driving in the park.

01:38:50.702 --> 01:38:51.901
Oh.

01:38:51.996 --> 01:38:54.370
May wat?
Yes please.

01:38:54.459 --> 01:38:57.033
Look at the flowers. Aren't they pretty?

01:38:57.129 --> 01:38:59.669
So nice for a young widow.

01:38:59.758 --> 01:39:01.798
- Yes.
- Horatio

01:39:01.886 --> 01:39:03.880
I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?

01:39:03.973 --> 01:39:05.683
Oh, no.

01:39:05.769 --> 01:39:08.439
Emma, dear. I just came in by chance.

01:39:08.523 --> 01:39:12.394
Your mother has been telling me
why you moved from Piccadilly.

01:39:12.489 --> 01:39:14.114
I think you're quite right.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.241
It was so very gloomy there.

01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:20.783
I haven't seen a great deal of you
since I've been back, Emma.

01:39:20.877 --> 01:39:24.378
- You know what it's like. There's so much to do.
- How is the child?

01:39:24.465 --> 01:39:27.088
I've been meaning every day this week
to go and see her.

01:39:27.178 --> 01:39:29.469
But it's so difficult. It takes almost a whole day.

01:39:29.558 --> 01:39:32.431
Emma, let us drive out
and see her this afternoon.

01:39:32.522 --> 01:39:34.101
Oh, yes.

01:39:34.192 --> 01:39:38.061
Lord Nelson, whom the whole of London knows,
calling on little Horatia Thompson.

01:39:38.156 --> 01:39:40.195
whose father no-one has as yet seen.

01:39:40.283 --> 01:39:43.120
My dear, what a titbit
for Lady Spencer's next dinner party.

01:39:44.414 --> 01:39:46.207
Come in.

01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:50.124
Thank you.

01:39:57.437 --> 01:40:01.140
My dear, I know you're very busy
and I don't want to intrude upon your affairs,

01:40:01.234 --> 01:40:04.523
but there are things that I don't quite understand
since I came back

01:40:04.616 --> 01:40:06.409
and to be honest I don't quite like

01:40:06.494 --> 01:40:07.740
What things do you mean?

01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:09.740
Three times this week I've tried to see you

01:40:09.833 --> 01:40:13.168
and each time you've had appointments
with people whom I don't know.

01:40:14.674 --> 01:40:16.713
We had no secrets at one time.

01:40:17.927 --> 01:40:19.303
Even in our letters.

01:40:20.515 --> 01:40:23.222
You surely do not ask to see all my letters.

01:40:24.438 --> 01:40:26.813
Certainly I do not ask to see them, my dear.

01:40:27.903 --> 01:40:29.695
If you want to hide them from me.

01:40:30.782 --> 01:40:32.112
You're jealous!

01:40:32.202 --> 01:40:33.662
Why do you make fun of me?

01:40:33.746 --> 01:40:36.203
Fun? I've never been so happy in all my life.

01:40:36.292 --> 01:40:38.119
You're splendid when you're jealous.

01:40:38.211 --> 01:40:40.751
You must promise me to be jealous always,
please.

01:40:42.343 --> 01:40:45.051
We were talking about some letters, weren't we?

01:40:47.436 --> 01:40:54.106
Horatio, if there are certain letters I would
sooner keep to myself, won't you trust me?

01:40:56.032 --> 01:40:57.860
What are those letters?

01:41:00.498 --> 01:41:01.780
Very well.

01:41:07.009 --> 01:41:09.049
Read them.

01:41:22.159 --> 01:41:23.785
I'm sorry.

01:41:23.871 --> 01:41:25.911
Forgive me.

01:41:26.792 --> 01:41:29.365
- I'll see you later.
-No, Horatio, don't go.

01:41:30.923 --> 01:41:33.878
You know what will happen
if you leave them unopened.

01:41:33.969 --> 01:41:36.544
We shall never quite understand each other
again.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.217
They're quite short, and to the point.

01:41:39.313 --> 01:41:41.353
Bills, bills, and more bills.

01:41:41.441 --> 01:41:45.061
Threats, summonses and lawsuits.
I'm up to my neck in them - drowned in them.

01:41:45.155 --> 01:41:48.526
Why do you think I left Piccadilly?
My dear, they threw me out.

01:41:48.618 --> 01:41:51.407
And why do you think
I haven't seen our child for two weeks?

01:41:51.498 --> 01:41:53.741
Because I owe Mrs Gibson
15 guineas for the rent.

01:41:53.835 --> 01:41:56.707
Do you think I like going out
with that little man from Venice?

01:41:56.797 --> 01:41:58.341
I hate the sight of him

01:41:58.426 --> 01:42:01.880
But I have to do it because he's promised me
a contract at his opera house.

01:42:01.974 --> 01:42:03.933
Yes, I'm going back to work.

01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:05.930
I've done it before and I can do it again.

01:42:06.023 --> 01:42:07.767
I don't really mind.

01:42:07.859 --> 01:42:10.434
You see, Horatio,
William didn't leave me a farthing.

01:42:10.530 --> 01:42:12.689
- Why wasn't I told?
- Why should you be told?

01:42:12.783 --> 01:42:14.527
These are my troubles, not yours.

01:42:14.619 --> 01:42:17.576
I've never asked anyone for money
and I never shall.

01:42:17.666 --> 01:42:18.580
Indeed?

01:42:18.668 --> 01:42:20.708
Then are you out of your senses?

01:42:22.716 --> 01:42:25.255
Now, you listen to me, and don't answer back!

01:42:26.138 --> 01:42:28.263
How dare you keep those bills from me.

01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:30.392
Aren't your worries my worries?

01:42:30.479 --> 01:42:32.520
Everything I have is yours.

01:42:32.608 --> 01:42:34.649
Everything!

01:42:37.825 --> 01:42:39.984
You're going to have a home of your own.

01:42:40.078 --> 01:42:43.495
And there is going to be no sorrow
and no trouble ever again.

01:42:44.835 --> 01:42:46.460
Emma.

01:42:46.545 --> 01:42:47.577
Dear Emma.

01:42:57.566 --> 01:43:00.734
Mm, that's the best drop of rum I've tasted
since the old days.

01:43:00.821 --> 01:43:04.239
We don't get much excuse to open a bottle
lately. You should come oftener.

01:43:04.326 --> 01:43:06.866
It warms the cockles of your heart.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.454
Captain Hardy, how nice to see you again.

01:43:12.548 --> 01:43:14.292
Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

01:43:14.384 --> 01:43:18.680
Well, to tell you the truth, I just happened to be
passing and thought I'd come and see you.

01:43:18.766 --> 01:43:20.095
Will you stay to luncheon?

01:43:20.185 --> 01:43:22.178
Oh, thank you, my lady.

01:43:22.271 --> 01:43:26.223
Mother, darling, tell the coachman we leave
at two. I want the child here before dark.

01:43:26.319 --> 01:43:27.566
Yes, dear, I'll tell him.

01:43:27.655 --> 01:43:30.694
He's in the garden. You can see his work of art
in the summerhouse.

01:43:30.786 --> 01:43:34.288
I don't want to disturb him, my lady.
I know he likes his peace and quiet.

01:43:34.376 --> 01:43:38.245
Just because he won't see St Vincent and Keith
when they write him pompous letters?

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:39.883
Oh, no, Hardy, you're different.

01:43:39.968 --> 01:43:41.511
You're an old friend. Come along.

01:43:41.595 --> 01:43:45.216
No, to tell you the truth, Lady Hamilton,
I didn't come to see him.

01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:47.019
I came to see you.

01:43:47.104 --> 01:43:49.146
Me?
Yes.

01:43:54.909 --> 01:43:57.864
There's no chance of our being overheard,
is there?

01:43:57.955 --> 01:44:00.282
No, but what is the mystery?

01:44:00.376 --> 01:44:04.209
Well, do you ever read the newspapers
down here?

01:44:04.298 --> 01:44:06.174
Not unless we can help it.

01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:09.049
We're not particularly interested
in the court news.

01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:10.850
Nor the gossip, the scandal.

01:44:10.935 --> 01:44:14.686
You may have missed what happened.
Bonaparte's made himseIf Emperor of France.

01:44:15.734 --> 01:44:17.562
Yes, we saw that.

01:44:17.654 --> 01:44:19.066
What is his next move?

01:44:19.157 --> 01:44:21.281
His next move will be the invasion of England.

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.781
Oh, ridiculous!

01:44:23.872 --> 01:44:25.250
So it may sound, my lady.

01:44:25.335 --> 01:44:29.382
That's what we all thought when we first heard it.
But it's true. This peace was no good.

01:44:29.466 --> 01:44:31.045
It'll break any day now.

01:44:31.135 --> 01:44:34.885
This self-styled Emperor
has made an alliance with Spain.

01:44:34.974 --> 01:44:37.728
He's raked together a new fleet
from goodness knows where.

01:44:37.812 --> 01:44:41.230
And he's building transports and barges
as fast as he can turn them out.

01:44:41.318 --> 01:44:45.235
From Boulogne to Brest,
every single Channel port is chock-full of them.

01:44:45.325 --> 01:44:48.742
He's got a whole army behind him
waiting to embark.

01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:52.699
A few weeks from now,
all he'll need is a fair wind.

01:44:53.754 --> 01:44:56.793
And all you'll need... will be Nelson.

01:44:57.678 --> 01:44:59.137
Yes, that's it, my lady.

01:45:00.223 --> 01:45:02.136
- Is that all?
- That's all, my lady.

01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:04.270
You see...

01:45:04.357 --> 01:45:05.900
Well...

01:45:05.985 --> 01:45:08.109
Nelson's the only man who can save us.

01:45:08.197 --> 01:45:09.526
Now, listen to me, Hardy,

01:45:09.615 --> 01:45:13.484
I have helped the Navy whenever I could,
but not this time, Hardy, not this time.

01:45:13.579 --> 01:45:17.910
Let them find some other man to take command.
Keith or Parker or St Vincent himself. Not him!

01:45:18.002 --> 01:45:20.674
Don't they understand, Hardy?
He's given so much.

01:45:20.757 --> 01:45:22.300
His arm, his sight, his health.

01:45:22.385 --> 01:45:24.178
He needs rest and he must have it.

01:45:24.264 --> 01:45:27.469
For the first time in his life
he's found peace of mind and happiness.

01:45:27.561 --> 01:45:29.306
And I'm going to see that he keeps it.

01:45:29.397 --> 01:45:31.307
If they want me to use my influence, I will.

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:35.614
All my influence to persuade him
that this new war is none of his business!

01:45:38.287 --> 01:45:40.079
That's...

01:45:40.165 --> 01:45:42.205
all I have to say.

01:45:43.127 --> 01:45:47.590
Of course, there's nothing to prevent you from
talking it over with him personally at luncheon.

01:45:48.844 --> 01:45:51.134
Will you stay?
No, thank you, my lady.

01:45:51.223 --> 01:45:54.062
I think perhaps l'd better get back.

01:45:55.899 --> 01:45:57.145
Goodbye, Hardy.

01:46:56.373 --> 01:46:59.993
Oh, come along. I thought you were dressing.
What have you been doing?

01:47:00.087 --> 01:47:03.255
We'll never get there if you don't look sharp.
Besides, I'm hungry.

01:47:03.341 --> 01:47:04.587
Starving.

01:47:04.677 --> 01:47:06.754
I don't think we'll go today, Horatio.

01:47:06.847 --> 01:47:11.727
It will save two trips if we pick her up tomorrow,
after you've been to the Admiralty.

01:47:14.486 --> 01:47:16.029
The Admiralty?

01:47:16.114 --> 01:47:17.941
Hardy has been here. They sent him.

01:47:18.033 --> 01:47:20.074
They need you, dear, badly.

01:47:20.161 --> 01:47:23.284
This war is coming, as you always said it would.

01:47:23.376 --> 01:47:25.416
And there's no-one else.

01:47:44.325 --> 01:47:46.366
Did you tell Hardy I would go?

01:47:47.456 --> 01:47:49.496
Yes.

01:47:50.461 --> 01:47:52.704
It's a matter of course, dear, isn't it?

01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:08.113
It'll be freezing tonight on the high roads
over the downs.

01:48:08.199 --> 01:48:10.656
Yes,
I think I'll take the little rug I use in my study.

01:48:10.745 --> 01:48:13.700
- Oh, yes, I know, I'll get it.
- I'll get it, Mother.

01:48:39.707 --> 01:48:41.749
He thought he wouldn't need the rug.

01:48:49.058 --> 01:48:51.100
He'll never come back, Mother.

01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:09.831
? Cheer up, my lads,'tis to glory we steer

01:49:10.425 --> 01:49:15.386
? To add something new to this wonderful year

01:49:15.475 --> 01:49:19.726
? To honour we call you as free men not slaves

01:49:19.817 --> 01:49:24.030
? For who are so free as the sons of the waves?

01:49:24.115 --> 01:49:26.240
? Hearts of oak are our ships

01:49:26.328 --> 01:49:28.368
? Jolly tars are our men

01:49:29.248 --> 01:49:31.621
? We always are ready

01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:33.750
? Steady, boys, steady

01:49:34.297 --> 01:49:38.761
? We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again

01:49:39.514 --> 01:49:42.352
Mr Pasco,
I will now amuse the fleet with a signal.

01:49:43.146 --> 01:49:44.475
Mr Pasco,

01:49:44.565 --> 01:49:46.605
I wish to say to the fleet...

01:49:47.904 --> 01:49:50.479
..''England confides
that every man will do his duty.''

01:49:50.575 --> 01:49:52.901
Be quick. I've one more to follow for close action.

01:49:52.995 --> 01:49:56.163
If you will permit me to substitute
''expects'' for ''confides'',

01:49:56.250 --> 01:49:57.580
it will be sooner completed.

01:49:57.670 --> 01:49:59.710
That will do. Make it directly.

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:03.755
Those Frenchmen
have sharpshooters up in the rigging, sir.

01:50:03.846 --> 01:50:05.044
I know. Why do you tell me?

01:50:05.139 --> 01:50:08.973
Do you think it's wise to wear all those
decorations? They make a nice target.

01:50:09.062 --> 01:50:11.353
- I won them in battle, didn't l?
- Yes, sir, but...

01:50:11.442 --> 01:50:13.482
Then I shall wear them in battle.

01:50:35.691 --> 01:50:36.557
England...

01:50:44.453 --> 01:50:45.449
Expects...

01:50:46.374 --> 01:50:47.453
That...

01:50:48.377 --> 01:50:49.326
Every...

01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:51.044
Man...

01:50:52.759 --> 01:50:54.635
Will...

01:50:54.721 --> 01:50:55.468
Do...

01:50:56.766 --> 01:50:58.428
His...

01:50:59.188 --> 01:51:00.184
Duty.

01:51:00.273 --> 01:51:04.189
? Come cheer up, my lads,'tis to glory we sail

01:51:04.279 --> 01:51:08.029
? To add something new to this wonderful year

01:51:08.785 --> 01:51:13.367
? To honour we call you as free men not slaves

01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:17.793
? For who are so free as the sons of the waves?

01:51:17.885 --> 01:51:19.924
? Hearts of oak are our ships

01:51:20.012 --> 01:51:22.219
? Jolly tars are our men

01:51:23.101 --> 01:51:25.558
? We always are ready

01:51:25.646 --> 01:51:28.650
? Steady, boys, steady

01:51:28.735 --> 01:51:30.610
? We'll fight and we'll conquer...

01:51:30.697 --> 01:51:32.737
We'll be on them in half an hour, sir.

01:51:43.342 --> 01:51:46.179
Mon capitaine,
la flotte enemie est nord-ouest et bâbord.

01:51:46.264 --> 01:51:49.102
Mon amiral,
la flotte enemie est nord-ouest et bâbord.

01:51:49.187 --> 01:51:50.468
Prèparez pour l'attaque.

01:52:33.298 --> 01:52:35.707
- They're getting pretty close now, sir.
-Not yet.

01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:15.283
Starboard broadside fire as you bear.

01:54:45.849 --> 01:54:47.891
Voilà l'Amiral!

01:54:55.241 --> 01:54:56.023
Sir!

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.875
They've... done for me, at last.

01:55:03.961 --> 01:55:05.705
You're not badly hurt, are you, sir?

01:55:05.797 --> 01:55:08.206
My backbone... shot through.

01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:18.775
- I'll carry you to Dr Beattie.
- You stay on deck. Come to me when you can.

01:55:20.907 --> 01:55:23.032
Cover my face... these decorations.

01:55:23.119 --> 01:55:25.908
No time for the men to see me like this.

01:56:03.101 --> 01:56:05.142
Mr Beattie...

01:56:06.316 --> 01:56:09.319
... I have no feeling... below my breast.

01:56:10.907 --> 01:56:12.947
No lower.

01:56:13.035 --> 01:56:15.075
I know what that means, Mr Beattie.

01:56:16.372 --> 01:56:17.832
My spine is broken.

01:56:17.916 --> 01:56:20.290
My lord...unhappily for our country,

01:56:20.379 --> 01:56:22.953
nothing...can be done for you.

01:56:23.968 --> 01:56:26.009
Poor Emma.

01:56:26.764 --> 01:56:28.806
What will become of her?

01:56:52.222 --> 01:56:53.422
Was that cheering?

01:56:53.517 --> 01:56:55.475
They're cheering in all our ships, my lord.

01:56:55.562 --> 01:56:57.639
The French line has broken.

01:56:57.732 --> 01:56:59.772
Why doesn't Hardy come?

01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:02.780
- He must be killed.
- He's on deck, sir. He can't leave.

01:57:26.655 --> 01:57:28.695
They're cheering again.

01:57:29.492 --> 01:57:31.652
The French flagship has surrendered, sir.

01:57:32.538 --> 01:57:34.247
Good.

01:57:34.333 --> 01:57:35.959
Why don't they bring Hardy to me?

01:57:36.045 --> 01:57:38.834
He sends a message, sir.
We're against the Redoubtable.

01:57:38.925 --> 01:57:41.085
When we have beaten her, he will come.

01:58:18.699 --> 01:58:21.405
- How goes it, Hardy?
- Fourteen of them are ours, sir.

01:58:22.997 --> 01:58:24.907
Not enough.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.373
Twenty. Twenty.

01:58:37.814 --> 01:58:41.600
Don't throw me overboard, Hardy.

01:58:41.695 --> 01:58:44.530
No, sir.
You know what to do.

01:58:45.992 --> 01:58:49.694
Let my dear Lady Hamilton have my hair...

01:58:50.833 --> 01:58:52.542
..and all things belonging to me.

01:58:52.628 --> 01:58:55.465
You mustn't die, sir. You mustn't die!

01:58:56.552 --> 01:58:58.545
It's all over now, Hardy.

01:58:58.638 --> 01:59:00.680
All over now.

01:59:03.856 --> 01:59:05.102
Sir!

01:59:05.192 --> 01:59:08.230
Sir! It's eighteen now sir

01:59:09.574 --> 01:59:11.817
Eighteen - a great victory.

01:59:16.209 --> 01:59:18.250
Thank God.

01:59:19.338 --> 01:59:21.379
I have done my duty.

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:27.434
Kiss me...Hardy.

01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:55.229
I am the resurrection and the life,
sayeth the Lord.

01:59:55.315 --> 02:00:00.109
He that believeth in me
though he were dead, yet shall he live;

02:00:00.197 --> 02:00:03.734
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die.

02:00:45.564 --> 02:00:48.769
It's all right, Anna, I'll draw them myself.
Thank you.

02:01:27.173 --> 02:01:28.668
My lady.

02:01:28.758 --> 02:01:32.177
- Do you come from Portsmouth, Hardy?
-No, Spithead, Lady Hamilton.

02:01:32.265 --> 02:01:34.509
I came on the St George, she's our fastest ship.

02:01:34.603 --> 02:01:38.224
Captain Blackwood went ahead to London
with the news.

02:01:38.318 --> 02:01:40.358
What is the news, Hardy?

02:01:41.155 --> 02:01:44.656
It was a great victory.
It was the greatest we've ever known.

02:01:45.412 --> 02:01:47.451
That's wonderful.

02:01:49.083 --> 02:01:50.875
It was nine days ago...

02:01:52.255 --> 02:01:56.885
we engaged them off Cape Trafalgar
the combined fleets of France and Spain

02:01:59.185 --> 02:02:01.226
They've been destroyed

02:02:02.399 --> 02:02:06.101
The oceans are free once more
and England is safe from invasion

02:02:10.953 --> 02:02:15.036
The first cannon was fired a little after twelve

02:02:16.254 --> 02:02:20.004
Within one hour five French
ships-of-the-line had struck their flags

02:02:20.093 --> 02:02:21.968
His plan was magnificent

02:02:22.054 --> 02:02:25.472
He swung our fleet from line of battle
into two spearheads,

02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:28.433
that broke the enemy line
into three separate parts.

02:02:29.358 --> 02:02:30.189
Then...

02:02:32.029 --> 02:02:36.245
about one-thirty
I was walking with him on the upper deck

02:02:38.416 --> 02:02:39.910
The fighting was at its height

02:02:40.001 --> 02:02:42.957
The French flagship the Redoubtable
came through the smoke

02:02:43.048 --> 02:02:46.133
and we fought alongside one another

02:02:46.219 --> 02:02:48.260
he was so

02:02:48.347 --> 02:02:50.306
confident.

02:02:51.437 --> 02:02:54.143
We'd just...turned to go...back to the...

02:03:11.928 --> 02:03:13.968
By sunset

02:03:14.056 --> 02:03:16.097
everything was over

02:03:17.562 --> 02:03:18.642
But

02:03:18.731 --> 02:03:22.233
he he lived to know
he'd won England's greatest victory

02:03:25.450 --> 02:03:28.490
His His last thoughts were with you my lady

02:03:30.168 --> 02:03:32.624
That you should be cared for

02:04:55.305 --> 02:04:58.511
- And then?
- Then what?

02:04:58.603 --> 02:05:00.645
What happened after?

02:05:05.615 --> 02:05:07.655
There is no then.

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:11.363
There is no after.
