00:02.400 --> 00:04.391
- Where were you last night?
- I was with Hannibal

00:04.430 --> 00:07.035
all night, Jack.
- My name is Miriam Lass.
I'm with the FBI.

00:07.070 --> 00:09.061
- Come in.
- (Jack): The Chesapeake Ripper

00:09.110 --> 00:11.601
recorded Miriam Lass
two years ago.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.609
- [Jack, I was so wrong.]
- (Will): You said yourself,
there's no body.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.302
- (Jack): Miriam Lass is dead.
- (Brian): Found something
else in the lures.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.319
- Madrona bark.
- Will didn't kill
any of these people.

00:20.350 --> 00:23.012
- There's a small stand
In VIrgInIa.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.500
- Jack, it's Miriam.

01:24.550 --> 01:27.542
I don't know where I am.
I can't see anything.

01:27.580 --> 01:32.256
I was so wrong.
I was so wrong.

01:32.290 --> 01:35.782
Please, Jack.
I don't want to die like this.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.788
Jack, it's Miriam.

01:37.830 --> 01:41.254
I don't know where I am.
I can't see anything.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.689
I was so wrong.
I was so wrong.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.714
Thank you.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.817
I knew you'd never
stop looking.

02:14.430 --> 02:15.829
Can I see him?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.791
- We haven't caught
the Ripper.

02:25.310 --> 02:26.937
- He's... he's still...?

02:26.980 --> 02:30.939
- We need your help, Miriam.
You know who he is.

02:30.980 --> 02:35.178
- I don't.
Know who he is.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.288
- You found him.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.448
- I don't remember
finding him.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.851
He got inside my head.

02:53.870 --> 02:57.328
I remember a dream
about drowning.

03:01.780 --> 03:03.748
And then being awake.

03:03.780 --> 03:05.338
And not awake.

03:05.380 --> 03:09.339
Being myself,
and not myself.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.518
I'd wake up to the smell
of fresh flowers

03:12.560 --> 03:14.551
and the sting
of a needle.

03:18.830 --> 03:20.422
I wasn't afraid.

03:24.430 --> 03:28.696
Fear and pain were so...
far away.

03:31.570 --> 03:34.232
- I was reckless
with your life.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.239
- I was reckless with my life.
- I saw

03:38.280 --> 03:40.612
what I needed in you
and I used you.

03:40.650 --> 03:44.017
I let you break the rules
on my behalf while I hid
behind deniability.

03:44.050 --> 03:47.759
- Agent Crawford, please do not
apologize to me for my mistakes.

03:47.790 --> 03:51.556
He treated me
very well,

03:51.590 --> 03:55.594
until the end,
until he put me in the ground.

03:55.630 --> 03:58.963
Even when...
he took my arm.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.264
He told me
what he was going to do.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.701
I went to sleep, woke up,
it was gone.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.841
He said he wanted
to gIve It to you.

04:15.850 --> 04:18.284
- Can you identify him?

04:18.320 --> 04:22.324
- I could hear his voice,
but I couldn't see his face.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.821
All I could see...

04:28.830 --> 04:30.468
...was light.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.348
- Why didn't he
kill you, Miriam?

04:46.350 --> 04:47.942
Why were you spared?

04:47.980 --> 04:50.744
- I wasn't spared.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.556
He was saving me
for last.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.069
- They found a witness.

05:08.070 --> 05:11.437
A survivor.
The only victim

05:11.470 --> 05:13.609
of the Chesapeake Ripper
who lived to tell.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.974
- Is this witness
watching me now?

05:19.980 --> 05:21.811
- (Alana): Yes.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.081
- (Hannibal): It seems I am
the usual suspect.

05:32.130 --> 05:36.863
- I keep having angry,
imaginary conversations
with Jack Crawford about that.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.702
I wish I could tell you
why this is happening.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.008
- His witness must not be able
to identify the Ripper by sight.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.588
Jack wants them
to hear my vonce;

05:56.620 --> 05:58.747
otherwise,
I'd be in here alone.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.382
Right?

06:06.830 --> 06:09.048
Still...

06:09.100 --> 06:11.091
I appreciate
your company.

06:36.460 --> 06:37.984
- It's not him.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.693
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

06:44.730 --> 06:46.732
He's not the Ripper.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.839
***

07:37.750 --> 07:39.718
- This is very sudden.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.115
- The federal prosecutor dropped
all charges.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.926
Since you were not convicted
of killing anyone,

07:45.960 --> 07:49.566
the basis for your sentencing
to this institution is

07:49.600 --> 07:52.489
null and void.

07:52.540 --> 07:56.135
The Chesapeake Ripper has
set you free.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.161
Mazel Tov.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.999
(door buzzer)
(door unlocked)

08:09.920 --> 08:12.184
I would love
nothing more

08:12.220 --> 08:16.828
than to see you trade places
with Dr. Lecter.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.954
I have no intention
of ending up on his menu.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.696
- Well, then confess,
Frederick.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.960
Might be the only thing
saves your life.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.558
- Confess to what?

08:26.600 --> 08:29.239
- Confess to bonding
with Hannibal Lecter

08:29.270 --> 08:32.103
over your shared practice
of unorthodox therapies.

08:32.140 --> 08:35.109
Dr. Lecter with me,
you with Abel Gideon.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.108
- Gideon is playing
his own game;

08:37.150 --> 08:39.243
was wheeled out of that hospital
by the Chesapeake Ripper.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.248
Curious what bargain
they struck.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.248
- No, there's no bargaining
with smoke.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.850
No, Gideon's dead.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.051
You're next.

08:48.090 --> 08:50.058
- Unless
I unburden myself?

08:50.090 --> 08:52.820
- Confession is
good for the soul.

08:54.830 --> 08:57.799
Shine a light
on your relationship
with Hannibal Lecter.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.798
He works in the shadows.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.831
Deny them to him.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.899
Tell Jack Crawford
everything.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.909
- Are you suggesting I kill
my career before Hannibal
can kill me?

09:08.940 --> 09:11.647
- I'm suggesting you convince
Jack Crawford however you can.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.714
Like your life depends
on it.

09:21.890 --> 09:24.154
- Why did Hannibal
not just kill you?

09:28.760 --> 09:30.819
- Because he_wants
to be my friend.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.249
- You need a ride?

09:50.990 --> 09:52.958
- I was gonna
call a cab.

09:52.990 --> 09:56.756
- We found Miriam Lass.

09:56.790 --> 09:58.985
Alive.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.291
- You catch the Ripper?

10:09.070 --> 10:10.799
How is she? Miriam.

10:12.810 --> 10:14.300
- Traumatized.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.706
Miriam thanked me

10:18.750 --> 10:20.911
after we found her.

10:20.950 --> 10:23.748
Thanked me for not
gIVIng up on her.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.658
But I had.
I had given up on her.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.055
And I gave up on you too.

10:29.090 --> 10:31.024
I thought she was dead.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.998
Ithought
you were crazy.

10:35.030 --> 10:38.022
And I gave up on trying
to find the both of you.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.231
- You didn't have to
find me, Jack.

10:53.450 --> 10:56.044
You just had to
listen to me.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.048
- I put Miriam in a room
with Hannibal Lecter.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.115
She stated definitively
he is not

11:00.160 --> 11:02.412
the Chesapeake Ripper.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.781
- That definitive enough
for you?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.229
- No.

11:08.230 --> 11:10.266
It wasn't.

11:16.170 --> 11:18.161
- Where'd you
find Miriam, Jack?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.310
- The property was condemned
years ago.

11:31.350 --> 11:34.888
Apparently the Ripper has been
using it since that time.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.754
Will.

12:09.790 --> 12:11.189
In here.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.087
It's Beverly Katz's blood.

12:44.130 --> 12:47.349
He drained her before he froze
her before he cut into her.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.898
Chesapeake Ripper's
latest victim,

12:52.940 --> 12:54.896
he was found
in the other cistern.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.204
The water in his lungs
is what led us here.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.139
We found Miriam
down there.

13:06.180 --> 13:09.013
She believed the Ripper
brought her here to kill her.

13:09.050 --> 13:11.484
He was saving her
to be his last victim.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.054
He knows we're_close
to catching hIm.

13:16.090 --> 13:18.422
- He's been
caught before.

13:18.460 --> 13:22.089
Catch a fish once
and it gets away...

13:24.100 --> 13:27.092
...it's a lot harder to catch
a second time.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.242
(steady heartbeat)

14:28.060 --> 14:30.893
I sowed the seeds...

14:30.930 --> 14:35.060
and watched them grow.

14:37.370 --> 14:39.634
I cultivated...

14:39.670 --> 14:43.071
a long chain of events
leading to this.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.644
All of this...

14:51.150 --> 14:54.313
...has been my design.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.329
It's theater.

15:08.970 --> 15:10.938
- Every time
the Ripper kills

15:10.970 --> 15:12.938
someone, it's theater.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.540
- The Ripper didn't bring
Miriam here to kill her.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.901
He brought her here
for you to find.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.084
- But the Ripper's
not self-destructive.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.180
He doesn't want to get caught.
- He wants you to catch someone.

15:27.220 --> 15:30.451
Like he wanted you
to catch me.

15:32.630 --> 15:36.350
Somewhere,
in all of this evidence,

15:36.400 --> 15:38.220
you will find something

15:38.270 --> 15:41.239
that will lead you away
from Hannibal Lecter.

15:41.270 --> 15:44.364
- Miriam Lass has
already done that.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.401
- Two years -

15:46.440 --> 15:50.501
it's a long time
to have Hannibal in your head.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.609
You can't
trust her, Jack.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.609
You can't trust any of this
to be what it seems.

16:22.110 --> 16:24.044
(dogs barking)

16:24.080 --> 16:26.048
Hey!
(He whistles.)

16:26.080 --> 16:27.479
Hey.

16:32.590 --> 16:34.148
- Welcome home.

16:34.190 --> 16:36.511
- Thank you.

16:39.330 --> 16:42.026
Thank you
for looking after them.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.766
They seem happy.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.792
- Happy to see you.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.798
- Who's this?

16:48.840 --> 16:51.559
- Applesauce.
She's mine.

16:51.610 --> 16:55.205
She likes applesauce.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.639
I rescued her.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.741
- Picking up
some of my bad habits?

17:04.750 --> 17:07.082
- Picking up
your good habits.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.123
You challenged
my whole framework

17:10.160 --> 17:13.095
of assumptions
about the way you are.

17:13.130 --> 17:17.464
The way I think you are.
- Well, the way you think I am

17:17.500 --> 17:20.469
isn't always a reliable guide
to who I am.

17:20.500 --> 17:24.800
- I was wrong about you.

17:24.840 --> 17:28.071
- Because you didn't believe me?
Or in me?

17:28.110 --> 17:30.305
Because you

17:30.350 --> 17:35.549
let me question my sanity,
my sense of reality?

17:35.580 --> 17:38.242
- Because you tried
to kill Hannibal.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.151
You're wrong about him, Will.

17:43.190 --> 17:45.784
- No, you're wrong about him,
Alana. You see the best in him.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.754
I”.dont.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.162
Hey?
- What was done to you

17:55.200 --> 17:57.339
doesn't excuse
what you did.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.604
Are you going to try
to hurt Hannibal again?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.845
Is he safe?

18:09.650 --> 18:11.789
- From me,
or for you?

18:20.560 --> 18:23.495
He's dangerous, Alana.

18:23.530 --> 18:27.091
I suggest you stay as far away
from Hannibal Lecter as you can.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.636
Come on.
(He whistles.)

18:36.680 --> 18:38.648
(He whistles.)

18:38.680 --> 18:41.217
(dog barking)

18:41.250 --> 18:43.138
- What can I do for you,

18:43.190 --> 18:45.613
Dr. Chilton?
- It is what I can do for you.

18:45.650 --> 18:48.813
I would like_
to offer my servnces
on the Ripper case - pro bono,

18:48.860 --> 18:52.250
of course.
- I see.

18:52.290 --> 18:55.259
You wish to be helpful
expediting Hannibal
Lecter's arrest?

18:55.300 --> 18:58.724
- I have consulted with the FBI
on prevrous Ripper murders.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.398
- You have an agenda
with this case, Doctor.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.238
- Yes, I have an agenda:
living.

19:04.270 --> 19:07.273
I should be assigned
an FBI escort.

19:07.310 --> 19:11.246
Everyone who
believed Will Graham
about Hannibal Lecter is dead.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.317
- Except you.
- Except me.

19:14.350 --> 19:18.286
I would like to remain not dead
for the foreseeable future.

19:20.390 --> 19:23.427
- Do you have
something substantial to
contribute, or just an opinion?

19:23.460 --> 19:25.883
- I have a witness.
- A Witness?

19:25.930 --> 19:28.490
- If Will is not a suspect,
then he is a witness.

19:28.530 --> 19:31.363
- To his own manipulation?
- We have had

19:31.400 --> 19:33.937
remarkable success
recovering memory.

19:33.970 --> 19:37.462
He remembers so much
of what was done to him.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.705
- Why hasn't Will
told me this himself?

19:39.740 --> 19:42.300
- Because you told him
his memories were meaningless.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.519
I imagine Hannibal Lecter used
the same coercive techniques

19:47.550 --> 19:50.940
on Miriam Lass that he used
on Will Graham.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.959
He buried memories
in both of them.

19:56.690 --> 20:00.649
Jack, I dug
those memories out of Will;
I can dig them out of Miriam.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.329
- Miriam Lass is not
your patient, Doctor.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.838
- Over the shoulder...

20:39.770 --> 20:41.738
- Are you an FBI agent?

20:41.770 --> 20:43.806
- No. Uh...

20:43.840 --> 20:46.809
I used to teach
at the academy.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.809
And, uh,
two days ago,

20:49.840 --> 20:51.649
I was an inmate

20:51.680 --> 20:54.740
at the Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane...

20:56.750 --> 20:59.014
...courtesy of
the Chesapeake Ripper.

21:01.890 --> 21:04.586
- Well, the Guru told me
the only person who had

21:04.630 --> 21:07.428
any practical understanding
of the Ripper was you.

21:07.460 --> 21:09.621
But he didn't mention
that you were a Victim.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.025
- Guru?

21:11.070 --> 21:13.334
- Jack Crawford.
- Oh.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.861
He has
a peculiar cleverness.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.970
- The Guru tells me

21:21.010 --> 21:23.444
that you don't remember much

21:23.480 --> 21:25.744
about what the Ripper
did to you.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.968
I couldn't remember either.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.716
- Couldn't?
- Oh, I remember now.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.617
Uh... not all of it.
Pieces.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.753
I was...
under his influence.

21:44.700 --> 21:47.066
He used
some kind of light

21:47.100 --> 21:51.400
to induce a seizure response
in my brain.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.432
It created blackouts
and lost time.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.918
- I remember the light.

22:00.950 --> 22:05.444
He, uh, would stand
in front of it,

22:05.490 --> 22:07.583
at a distance from me,

22:07.620 --> 22:11.886
silhouetted, very still.
He would

22:11.930 --> 22:15.957
listen to chamber music.
I still hear that.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.093
(Hannibal): You're waking now.

22:18.130 --> 22:22.362
- And his voice, low and even,
would pull me to him.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.561
- (Hannibal): Waking
in a pleasant room. Safe...

22:24.610 --> 22:26.134
- Like a current.

22:26.170 --> 22:30.778
- (Hannibal): You're waking now.
Waking, calm.

22:30.810 --> 22:34.041
Waking in a pleasant room,
safe.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.608
- You and I

22:37.650 --> 22:42.349
are... part
of his design.

22:46.430 --> 22:49.797
He wanted you
to be free.

22:49.830 --> 22:52.765
He wanted me
to be free too.

22:52.800 --> 22:56.531
- Neither of us are
really free.

22:56.570 --> 22:58.561
He's not done.

23:19.590 --> 23:21.592
- The same unfortunate
aftershave.

23:25.630 --> 23:28.667
Too long in the bottle.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.845
- Our last kit_chen conversation
was interrupted

23:37.880 --> 23:40.610
by Jack Crawford.

23:40.650 --> 23:43.881
I'd like to pick up
where we left off.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.888
If memory serves,

23:45.920 --> 23:48.809
you were asking me...

23:48.860 --> 23:52.523
if it would feel good
to kill you.

23:54.730 --> 23:56.698
- You've given that
some thought.

23:56.730 --> 23:59.221
- You wanted me to embrace
my nature, Doctor.

23:59.270 --> 24:03.195
I'm just following the urges
I kept down for so long,

24:03.240 --> 24:06.209
cultivating them
as the inspirations they are.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.902
- You never answered
my question.

24:11.980 --> 24:14.141
How would killing me
make you feel?

24:14.180 --> 24:16.717
- Righteous.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.116
- Aren't you
curious, Will?

24:19.150 --> 24:22.051
Why you?

24:22.090 --> 24:23.648
Why Miriam Lass?

24:23.690 --> 24:25.658
What does the Chesapeake Ripper
want with you?

24:25.690 --> 24:27.692
- No, you tell me.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.096
How did Miriam Lass
find you?

24:37.140 --> 24:40.132
You made sure no one could
find you that way again.

24:43.110 --> 24:46.807
- If I'm not the Ripper,
you murder an innocent man.

24:46.850 --> 24:50.889
You better than anyone
know what it means

24:50.920 --> 24:52.979
to be wrongly accused.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.988
You were innocent
and no one saw it.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.580
- No, I'm not innocent.
You saw to that.

24:57.630 --> 25:01.748
- If I am the Ripper and you
kill me, who will answer
your questions?

25:03.970 --> 25:07.121
Don't you want to know
how this ends?

25:40.670 --> 25:42.638
- My name is Miriam Lass.
I'm with the FBI.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.831
I would show you my credentials,
but I'm actually just a trainee.

25:44.870 --> 25:48.738
- Never just a trainee.
An agent in training. Please,

25:48.780 --> 25:50.179
come in.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.315
I would have been happy

26:01.360 --> 26:03.920
to come to your office, Jack.
- I understand,

26:03.960 --> 26:05.928
but I wanted
to do this here.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.951
- I'm sure you have
your reasons.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.265
The most-important aspect
of a successful recovery is

26:11.300 --> 26:14.269
recognizing that life will
never be the same.

26:14.300 --> 26:18.304
- Then I must be well on my way
to a successful recovery.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.957
That's beautiful. Yours?

26:35.990 --> 26:37.958
- Yes.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.356
I enjoy portraiture.

26:40.390 --> 26:43.359
A subject's mental process
betrayed

26:43.400 --> 26:46.961
only by the expression
on their face.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.889
- Miriam.
The Chesapeake Ripper

26:49.940 --> 26:53.831
sent me a message from you.
It was recorded

26:53.880 --> 26:55.836
shortly after
you were taken.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.745
- It's me? My voice?

26:57.780 --> 26:59.748
- Yes.

26:59.780 --> 27:01.179
- I want to hear it.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.882
- Very well.

27:09.060 --> 27:11.858
- Jack, it's Miriam.
I don't know where I am.

27:11.890 --> 27:14.393
I can't see anything.

27:14.430 --> 27:17.092
I was so wrong.
I was so wrong.

27:17.130 --> 27:19.724
Please, Jack.

27:19.770 --> 27:21.567
I don't wanna die
like this.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.032
- I don't remember.

27:30.310 --> 27:33.143
- Would you
like to try?

27:33.180 --> 27:36.172
You're waking now.

27:36.220 --> 27:39.189
Waking, calm.

27:39.220 --> 27:42.314
Waking
in a pleasant room.

27:44.390 --> 27:46.426
Safe.

27:51.130 --> 27:52.722
Open your eyes.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.136
- Jack.
Jack, it's Miriam.

28:03.180 --> 28:06.206
- Tell me
where you are.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.172
- I don't know where I am.

28:10.180 --> 28:13.308
- What do you see?

28:13.350 --> 28:15.386
- I... I can't see
anything.

28:15.420 --> 28:18.253
I was so wrong.

28:18.290 --> 28:20.224
Jack, please.

28:20.260 --> 28:23.127
I don't wanna die
like this.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.129
- Miriam... what was

28:26.170 --> 28:28.991
the last thing you remember
before making the call?

28:36.180 --> 28:38.148
- The wound man.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.139
- We found a fingerprint
on a flower petal.

28:44.190 --> 28:48.081
A partial, smudged.
Not enough points for

28:48.120 --> 28:51.385
a courtroom, but it triggered
a match in the system.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.751
Hannibal Lecter.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.825
- After all

28:55.860 --> 28:58.169
these murders, the Ripper's
gonna leave a print now?

28:58.200 --> 29:02.534
- Will said whatever evidence
we found, it would lead us
away from the Ripper.

29:02.570 --> 29:05.004
- We also found sodium amytal
and scopolamine

29:05.040 --> 29:06.769
in Miriam's blood.

29:06.810 --> 29:09.404
- Dr. Chilton_ used
scopolamine

29:09.440 --> 29:12.409
and sodium amytal
on both Gideon and Will

29:12.450 --> 29:14.771
during their therapy.
One claimed

29:14.820 --> 29:18.540
to be the Chesapeake Ripper
and the other accused Hannibal.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.058
- "You've got the right box,

29:21.090 --> 29:23.251
but you're looking
in the wrong corner."

29:23.290 --> 29:26.487
Gideon pointed me
at Chilton,

29:26.530 --> 29:28.555
told me that he was
the Ripper.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.569
- Wait. I'm confused._
So, who are we saying is

29:31.600 --> 29:35.798
the Chesapeake Ripper?
Dr. Lecter, or Dr. Chilton?

29:38.940 --> 29:40.339
- Bring 'em both in.

29:49.550 --> 29:52.849
(faint steady beeping)

30:10.500 --> 30:13.503
(continuous steady beeping)

30:23.550 --> 30:26.542
(flatline tone)

30:58.620 --> 31:01.885
- Hello, Frederick.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.285
- Oh, my god.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.151
(knocking)

31:05.190 --> 31:08.318
- That will be the FBI.

31:13.030 --> 31:17.091
When you wake up,
your only choice will be to run.

31:17.140 --> 31:20.132
(doorbell)
One moment, please.

33:05.350 --> 33:07.341
(dogs barking)

33:13.790 --> 33:16.088
- May I use
your shower, please?

33:21.800 --> 33:23.756
- Gideon hasn't
been dead for long,

33:23.800 --> 33:25.688
no more than
a couple of hours.

33:25.730 --> 33:28.437
Chilton's been carving steaks
off of him for days.

33:28.470 --> 33:31.735
- Chilton's shelves are filled
with a lot of old medical books.

33:31.770 --> 33:33.738
- The wound man.
- Mm-hmm.

33:33.770 --> 33:37.433
This illustration shows up
in a lot of early texts.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.573
It's the Ripper's
sixth victim.

33:39.610 --> 33:43.046
- Chilton was consulting
on the Ripper case when
Miriam disappeared.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.048
She must've talked to him,
made the connection.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.581
Beverly made
a connection too.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.588
Chilton's been a part
of the Ripper case

33:49.620 --> 33:54.193
since before Will Graham,
Hannibal Lecter, Miriam Lass.

33:54.230 --> 33:57.051
He had access
to case files.

33:57.100 --> 34:00.228
He would know everything
the Ripper would need to know.

34:03.840 --> 34:09.335
- I have the same profile
as Hannibal Lecter.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.838
Same medical
and psychological background.

34:12.880 --> 34:16.543
We are both doctors of note
in our field.

34:16.580 --> 34:18.389
Of course it would be me!

34:18.420 --> 34:22.151
Hannibal was never going
to kill me.

34:22.190 --> 34:25.284
I'm his patsy. I...

34:25.330 --> 34:28.219
I have to leave the country.
I am leaving the country.

34:28.260 --> 34:30.228
- No, if you run,
you look guilty.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.569
- You did not run
and you looked plenty guilty.

34:32.600 --> 34:37.594
Abel _Gideon was half-eaten
in my guest room.

34:37.640 --> 34:40.108
I have corpses
on my property.

34:40.140 --> 34:43.769
You just threw up an ear.
- There's an APB on you

34:43.810 --> 34:46.802
right now. They've canceled
credit cards, they're
tracing your phone.

34:46.850 --> 34:49.614
- I have cash
and I tossed my phone.

34:49.650 --> 34:52.744
Jack Crawford thinks I killed
two agents - three agents.

34:52.790 --> 34:56.351
You know what tends to happen
to people who do that?
Shoot on sight.

34:56.390 --> 35:00.224
- I'm going to prove Hannibal
Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.797
- I know you will.
And when you do,

35:02.830 --> 35:06.197
I will read about it
from a secure location

35:06.230 --> 35:10.189
and I will reintroduce myself
to society at that time.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.129
(dogs barking)

35:24.620 --> 35:28.852
Will... what have you done?

35:28.890 --> 35:32.223
- I called Jack Crawford.
- No.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.659
N...

35:35.660 --> 35:38.697
No. No.

35:38.730 --> 35:40.698
No.

35:40.730 --> 35:45.303
No! No!
No, stay there!

35:47.810 --> 35:50.472
- You're not a killer,
Frederick.

35:54.620 --> 35:59.319
Why'd you come alone,
Jack? Why'd you come alone?
- Where is he? Where is he?!

35:59.350 --> 36:01.386
- Hey, I told you, everything is
not what it seems.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.911
The Chesapeake Ripper is still
playing with us. All of us.

36:03.960 --> 36:07.885
- The Chesapeake Ripper is not
playing all of us, Will;
he's playing you.

36:07.930 --> 36:10.728
- Jack, wait.
I'll bring him out.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.558
He's got a gun.
- Good.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.180
CHILTON!

37:01.420 --> 37:03.411
Chilton,
stop where you are!

37:33.010 --> 37:34.614
- Please.

37:44.390 --> 37:45.880
- One navy blue sweater,

37:45.930 --> 37:49.627
one pair of men's dress pants
in charcoal gray,

37:49.660 --> 37:52.322
one black and red
pea coat,

37:52.370 --> 37:56.739
one black leather billfold
containing

37:56.770 --> 38:00.536
$443, various credit cards,

38:00.570 --> 38:02.879
one set of car keys.

38:02.910 --> 38:04.878
- I need to speak
to Will Graham.

38:04.910 --> 38:07.071
- I don't care
what you need.

38:07.110 --> 38:10.716
- One Montblanc fountain pen
in silver and black.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.518
- Does it have to be you?

38:15.560 --> 38:17.881
It seems like one
final indignity.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.518
- Not like you

38:22.560 --> 38:24.767
to hide an achievement.
- The achievement

38:24.800 --> 38:28.395
is not mine.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.863
- Whose is it?

38:30.900 --> 38:32.458
Hannibal Lecter's?

38:32.510 --> 38:36.901
- Those are just words
coming out of your mouth.

38:38.910 --> 38:41.743
No weight to them.

38:41.780 --> 38:44.783
No consideration
they may be true.

38:44.820 --> 38:47.345
- They're not true.

38:47.390 --> 38:49.608
You were using
coercive therapies,

38:49.660 --> 38:51.855
influencing Abel Gideon
and Will Graham

38:51.890 --> 38:55.121
to point the Ripper
investigations in
false directions.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.718
- You cannot see it,

38:56.760 --> 38:58.921
and you will not see it
until it is too late.

38:58.970 --> 39:02.462
Don't say I did not
warn you, Dr. Bloom.

39:04.470 --> 39:06.961
In fact, I believe

39:07.010 --> 39:09.570
these should be my last words
on the subject of the Ripper

39:09.610 --> 39:11.805
until my lawyer arrives.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.618
You're waking now.

39:15.650 --> 39:18.881
Waking, calm.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.683
Waking in a quiet room.

39:25.860 --> 39:29.899
You're waking now.
Waking in a quiet room. Safe.

39:31.900 --> 39:34.391
- It's him. It's him.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.761
(stuttering): It's him... It--

39:39.110 --> 39:40.839
(Miriam crying)

39:40.870 --> 39:43.100
- It's all right.

40:08.470 --> 40:10.461
(knocking on door)

40:27.850 --> 40:30.159
- Hello, Will.

40:30.190 --> 40:32.181
- May I come in?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.659
- Do you intend
to point a gun at me?

40:39.600 --> 40:40.999
- Not tonight.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.135
Are you expecting someone?

40:52.010 --> 40:53.568
- Only you.

40:53.610 --> 40:56.010
- Kept my standing
appointment open?

40:58.280 --> 41:00.487
- And you're
right on time.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.849
- I have to
deal with you.

41:07.890 --> 41:10.495
And my feelings
about you.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.897
I think it's best
if I do that directly.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.070
- First you have to grieve
for what is lost

41:22.110 --> 41:24.078
and what has changed.

41:24.110 --> 41:27.978
- I've changed;
you changed me.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.918
- The friendship
that we had is over.

41:32.950 --> 41:36.215
The Chesapeake Ripper
is over.

41:36.260 --> 41:39.229
- It had to be Miriam,
didn't it?

41:39.260 --> 41:42.752
She was compelled
to take his life

41:42.800 --> 41:44.859
so she could
take her own back.

41:47.230 --> 41:49.232
- How will you
take your life back?

41:56.880 --> 41:59.007
- I'd like to resume
my therapy.

42:21.900 --> 42:23.891
- Where shall we begin?

42:32.250 --> 42:35.242
