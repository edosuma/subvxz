WEBVTT

02:47.300 --> 02:48.535
What's up?

02:49.435 --> 02:51.104
Animal Planet.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.774
Man, I just had the craziest dream.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.943
-About what?
-I don't remember.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.212
Yeah. Yeah.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.382
Morning, guys.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.217
Morning, Gene.

03:07.122 --> 03:08.590
What did we do last night?

03:08.823 --> 03:10.225
I don't know.

03:11.026 --> 03:13.730
Wait. Didn't the twins have a party?

03:13.962 --> 03:15.999
Yeah, that's it. Twins had a party.

03:16.199 --> 03:18.068
-Right.
-Right.

03:18.735 --> 03:20.470
Were we there?

03:21.338 --> 03:23.006
I'm assuming we were.

03:23.207 --> 03:25.843
What kind of boyfriends
would we be if we weren't?

03:26.710 --> 03:28.246
Did I get any messages?

03:28.913 --> 03:30.014
Nope.

03:32.584 --> 03:33.952
See you tomorrow, Gene.

03:34.319 --> 03:35.888
Shibby.

03:38.324 --> 03:40.226
How do you know Gene?

03:41.260 --> 03:43.496
Oh, I thought he was your friend.

03:43.696 --> 03:45.866
No, no, I don't know him.

03:49.569 --> 03:51.305
I'm starving.

03:56.811 --> 03:59.948
-It's pudding.
-I always wondered what a fridge...

04:00.148 --> 04:02.417
...full of pudding would look like.

04:03.018 --> 04:06.222
Is it possible that we got
so wasted last night...

04:06.422 --> 04:10.126
...we bought a lifetime supply
of pudding and then forgot about it?

04:13.696 --> 04:15.465
I'd say it's entirely possible.

04:18.335 --> 04:20.538
-Jesse.
-And Chester are shibby right now.

04:20.738 --> 04:24.075
Please leave your shibby at the beep.
Shibby.

04:24.509 --> 04:26.310
What happened last night?

04:26.511 --> 04:30.181
You show up with a bunch of people,
pizzas and a keg. Our house is trashed.

04:30.382 --> 04:33.218
You're sucky boyfriends.
Always disappointing us.

04:33.419 --> 04:36.255
Now you're probably on the couch
in your underwear.

04:36.456 --> 04:37.623
Playing thumb wars.

04:37.824 --> 04:39.358
Wearing those Army helmets.

04:39.558 --> 04:42.762
And if you are, you've probably
forgotten our anniversary.

04:42.963 --> 04:44.264
Which is today.

04:44.465 --> 04:47.335
You don't get the special treats
we had for you.

04:47.535 --> 04:50.505
Just wanted to thank you guys
for trashing our house.

04:50.705 --> 04:51.939
Bye!

04:52.373 --> 04:53.575
Twins sound pissed.

04:54.242 --> 04:57.145
-Good thing we already got them gifts.
-Yeah.

04:57.879 --> 05:01.016
So where are the gifts?

05:02.451 --> 05:05.121
-They must be in your car.
-They're in the car.

05:05.321 --> 05:08.258
So we'll just take the gifts
to the twins' house...

05:08.492 --> 05:09.826
...get our special treats.

05:10.026 --> 05:12.796
Hey, what do you think they mean
by special treats?

05:12.996 --> 05:15.466
We've been going out with them
for a year now.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.401
And we still haven't had sex.

05:17.902 --> 05:21.706
"Special treats" is code for sex.

05:21.940 --> 05:23.541
Of course.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.078
-Special treats!
-Sex.

05:26.278 --> 05:27.680
Open up, you slackers!

05:28.080 --> 05:29.281
Mr. Pizzacoli!

05:29.481 --> 05:30.950
You left work last night...

05:31.217 --> 05:33.319
...with 30 pizzas
that didn't get delivered!

05:33.519 --> 05:34.988
I want some answers!

05:35.221 --> 05:37.824
Open up this damn door!

05:38.025 --> 05:39.059
It's open.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.231
-Moron!
-What? I'm sorry.

05:54.876 --> 05:55.911
Mr. Pizzacoli.

05:56.111 --> 05:59.082
-Hi, how you doing?
-30 pizzas didn't get delivered!

05:59.548 --> 06:02.919
If I found out you was taking
my pizza home to eat yourselves...

06:03.119 --> 06:05.222
...I will crush you like a doodlebug!

06:05.422 --> 06:07.124
-Look, it's an elephant!
-What?

06:09.793 --> 06:13.964
-Guess it was just a mailman.
-You two are the most irresponsible...

06:14.165 --> 06:16.968
...and disappointing employees
ever to work...

06:17.168 --> 06:19.738
...at Mr. Pizzacoli's
Pronto Pizza Delivery!

06:19.938 --> 06:22.574
A trained dolphin could do
a better job than you!

06:23.141 --> 06:25.911
Well, sure, but then the pizzas
would get all wet.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.580
Look, a unicorn!

06:30.383 --> 06:31.418
A unicorn?

06:31.651 --> 06:34.988
Sorry, I guess it was just
a regular horse. Weird!

06:35.189 --> 06:37.124
You've been embezzling my pizza.

06:37.324 --> 06:39.694
And I will catch you eventually.

06:39.894 --> 06:43.565
And when I do, I swear to God,
you will never deliver pizzas...

06:43.765 --> 06:45.133
...in this town again!

06:49.037 --> 06:50.673
-Close one.
-Yeah.

06:53.809 --> 06:55.545
We'll go to the twins' house.

06:55.745 --> 06:59.282
We'll give them their gifts
and apologize for trashing the house.

06:59.483 --> 07:01.885
And then we get our special treats.

07:04.554 --> 07:05.923
Dude, where's my car?

07:06.123 --> 07:07.492
Where's your car, dude?

07:09.527 --> 07:10.895
Dude, where's my car?

07:12.797 --> 07:14.132
Where's your car, dude?

07:14.633 --> 07:16.302
Dude, where's my car?

07:16.669 --> 07:18.037
Where's your car, dude?

07:18.637 --> 07:20.873
-Did I drive last night?
-Yeah, I think so.

07:21.073 --> 07:24.010
-Really?
-I'm not sure.

07:25.879 --> 07:29.282
-Dude, where's your car?
-Dude, it's not funny. It's gone.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.986
-Yeah.
-Dude, where's my car?

07:35.389 --> 07:36.590
Shut up, dude!

07:36.791 --> 07:38.459
Okay. Okay, look.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.062
You're right.
What we need to do is...

07:41.263 --> 07:43.932
...get into the state of mind
we were in last night.

07:44.133 --> 07:46.135
That way, we can retrace our steps.

07:46.668 --> 07:49.438
-Yeah.
-Sense Memory Simulated Perception...

07:49.638 --> 07:52.142
...Altered Consciousness
Memory Retrieval.

07:53.976 --> 07:55.312
Discovery Channel.

07:55.512 --> 07:56.980
Nice.

07:57.214 --> 07:59.316
-Nelson's?
-Shibby.

08:06.157 --> 08:08.160
-I'm sick of walking, dude.
-Me too.

08:10.095 --> 08:12.998
Hey, it's Mrs. Crabbleman.
She'll give us a ride.

08:13.198 --> 08:14.600
Hey, Mrs. Crabbleman!

08:15.067 --> 08:17.170
Hey! Hey!

08:19.072 --> 08:21.174
Mrs. Crabbleman.

08:27.581 --> 08:29.550
Fucking stoners.

08:31.519 --> 08:33.454
She must not have recognized you.

08:33.655 --> 08:35.357
-It's the Binglemans.
-Oh, hey.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.125
Mr. Bingleman!

08:38.828 --> 08:40.229
Hey, Mr. Bingleman.

08:44.067 --> 08:46.803
-Maybe we should just walk.
-Yeah.

08:47.003 --> 08:48.872
Listen, Nelson, the car is gone...

08:49.138 --> 08:51.608
...and we need to do
this sense memory thing...

08:51.808 --> 08:55.146
...so we can get back in the state
of mind we were in last night.

08:55.746 --> 08:59.084
Deep in your consciousness,
you must look.

08:59.417 --> 09:03.622
Concentrate on the knowledge inside,
you must.

09:05.290 --> 09:07.459
Your eyes, you must close.

09:07.660 --> 09:09.728
And you take it to the mo.

09:19.606 --> 09:20.908
Whoops.

09:29.284 --> 09:30.852
Concentrating, you're not.

09:31.653 --> 09:32.921
Sorry.

09:33.121 --> 09:35.758
-Is your dog dead?
-He's not dead.

09:35.958 --> 09:38.294
Come here, Jackal. Come here, boy.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.030
-I don't think he's coming.
-Maybe he's deaf.

09:41.230 --> 09:42.498
Deaf, he is not, dude.

09:42.799 --> 09:43.767
Come here, Jackal.

09:44.034 --> 09:46.537
-Come here, Jackal.
-Does he know any other tricks...

09:46.770 --> 09:48.372
...besides not moving?

09:49.039 --> 09:51.608
All right, you want
to see a trick, man?

09:51.809 --> 09:52.877
Hey, Jackal.

09:58.850 --> 10:00.218
Bite down, killer.

10:00.419 --> 10:02.588
Here comes the fun. All right.

10:06.725 --> 10:08.194
Good boy, Jackal.

10:08.394 --> 10:10.163
Good boy.

10:10.864 --> 10:13.667
Breathe deep. There you go.

10:13.867 --> 10:17.238
-Dude, your dog's a stoner.
-Can he also bong a beer?

10:17.438 --> 10:20.074
Nah, pretty much all he does is...

10:20.274 --> 10:21.910
...lie around and smoke his pipe.

10:22.110 --> 10:23.745
Jackal, can I see your pipe?

10:24.412 --> 10:28.550
Oh, no, don't!
Very protective, he is of his pipe.

10:28.751 --> 10:32.321
When other people touch it,
he does not like.

10:32.521 --> 10:33.722
Sorry, Jackal.

10:34.724 --> 10:36.659
Yeah, see? He's sorry.

10:37.060 --> 10:38.495
Holy crap.

10:38.695 --> 10:42.166
-That's one psycho dog, dude.
-You know what we should do now?

10:42.399 --> 10:45.236
-Eat?
-No. Eat.

10:46.738 --> 10:50.208
Choice excellent, my friend.
I'll get the keys.

11:09.463 --> 11:10.931
Hey, Nelson. Let me order.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.901
"Chinese Foooood. " May I help you?

11:14.102 --> 11:16.571
-I'd like to place an order.
-What you like?

11:16.771 --> 11:19.341
Yeah, I'd like three orders
of garlic chicken.

11:19.541 --> 11:22.243
-And then?
-And then three orders of white rice.

11:22.444 --> 11:26.081
-And then?
-And then....

11:26.282 --> 11:28.151
-Hey, you guys want soup?
-Sure.

11:28.351 --> 11:31.454
-Yeah. Three orders of won ton soup.
-And then?

11:31.754 --> 11:34.925
-Oh, some fortune cookies too.
-And then?

11:36.560 --> 11:37.594
That's about it.

11:37.795 --> 11:38.962
And then?

11:41.199 --> 11:42.667
No, that's it.

11:42.867 --> 11:44.469
-And then?
-No "and then."

11:44.669 --> 11:46.738
I-- That's all I want.

11:46.938 --> 11:48.073
And then?

11:50.476 --> 11:54.980
And then-- And then nothing else,
because I'm done ordering. Okay?

11:55.181 --> 11:56.649
And then?

11:59.152 --> 12:02.923
See, all I want is the three orders
of the garlic chicken...

12:03.123 --> 12:04.191
...and the white rice.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.626
And then?

12:05.826 --> 12:08.696
-And the soup, dude.
-Oh, and the won ton soup.

12:08.963 --> 12:11.365
-And then?
-And the cookies, fortune.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.967
And the fortune cookies.

12:13.167 --> 12:16.504
So it's just the chicken, the rice...

12:16.705 --> 12:19.542
...the soup and the fortune cookies,
and that's it.

12:20.175 --> 12:21.844
And then?

12:25.482 --> 12:27.951
And then you can put it
in a brown paper bag...

12:28.151 --> 12:31.021
...and put it in my hand,
because I'm ready to eat.

12:31.555 --> 12:33.157
And then?

12:33.657 --> 12:36.560
I refuse to play
your Chinese food mind games.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.464
-And then?
-No! No "and then"!

12:39.664 --> 12:42.000
-And then?
-No "and then"!

12:42.200 --> 12:44.169
-And then?
-No "and then"!

12:44.369 --> 12:45.938
-And then?
-No! No "and then"!

12:46.138 --> 12:49.708
-And then?
-You're starting to piss me off, lady.

12:49.908 --> 12:52.245
-And then?
-And then...

12:52.445 --> 12:56.216
...I'm gonna come in there
and put my foot in your ass...

12:56.416 --> 12:59.086
...if you say "and then" again!

13:04.625 --> 13:07.395
And then and then
and then and then and then....

13:14.069 --> 13:16.439
And then?

13:16.639 --> 13:19.475
Come on, Nelson,
just help us find my car.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.913
You didn't have to go all "egg roll"
on that speaker box.

13:23.113 --> 13:25.782
I'm not the one that called
the Dalai Lama a fag.

13:25.982 --> 13:30.087
-I was just kidding around.
-Well, Nelson didn't appreciate it.

13:30.488 --> 13:33.724
Look, it's Christie Boner.

13:38.363 --> 13:41.700
Wow! The hottest of the hot.

13:41.900 --> 13:45.504
El fuego of all that is el fuego.

13:49.642 --> 13:53.213
-Did she just wave at us?
-No way. She would never wave at us.

13:53.413 --> 13:55.282
Then why did she just wave at us?

13:55.482 --> 13:58.252
I don't know. Maybe she thinks
we're other people.

13:58.452 --> 13:59.620
People she waves to.

14:05.126 --> 14:06.695
Hi, Chester.

14:07.396 --> 14:08.464
Hi.

14:08.831 --> 14:12.435
Hi, Jesse. I had a really
good time with you last night.

14:15.672 --> 14:17.807
-Me too.
-That was some crazy party.

14:18.508 --> 14:21.612
-Hey, have you seen my car?
-Well, I saw it last night.

14:23.247 --> 14:25.082
I mean, I saw the back seat.

14:25.850 --> 14:29.253
-I mean the whole thing.
-Get another one with all the money...

14:29.453 --> 14:31.723
-...you were throwing around.
-Money?

14:31.923 --> 14:35.193
Yeah. You had that really nice
suitcase full of money.

14:36.629 --> 14:40.600
-A suitcase full of money?
-Don't you remember giving me $500...

14:40.833 --> 14:43.002
...to show you my hoo-hoos?

14:43.870 --> 14:46.539
-$500?
-Hoo-hoos?

14:46.739 --> 14:49.476
You mean, you don't remember anything?

15:00.288 --> 15:01.456
How about now?

15:02.791 --> 15:03.926
No.

15:04.526 --> 15:06.562
How about now?

15:11.935 --> 15:13.403
I'm a little bit fuzzy too.

15:13.636 --> 15:16.774
Maybe if I could get
a little refresher course.

15:21.345 --> 15:22.947
-All right.
-Go.

15:24.015 --> 15:26.317
-Are these losers bothering you?
-No, Tommy.

15:26.518 --> 15:29.488
Guys like you could never score
with a chick like this.

15:29.688 --> 15:32.391
-Stick to your own kind.
-Don't be such a jerk.

15:32.591 --> 15:34.894
Next time you guys
bother my girlfriend...

15:35.094 --> 15:38.198
-...stoner-bashing time.
-Oh, yeah?

15:38.431 --> 15:39.632
Yeah.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.802
-Okay.
-Consider this your warning.

15:45.873 --> 15:47.341
Later, dudes!

15:50.912 --> 15:53.381
Dude, you touched
Christie Boner's hoo-hoo.

15:53.581 --> 15:54.783
Shibby!

15:54.983 --> 15:56.351
Low-five.

15:57.386 --> 15:59.588
-Yeah.
-Let's get out of here.

16:01.590 --> 16:02.558
Chester!

16:02.892 --> 16:05.695
Dude, that Christie Boner
is super hot.

16:05.896 --> 16:08.231
Where did we get a suitcase
full of money?

16:08.431 --> 16:09.800
Why don't we have it now?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.870
Maybe we deposited it
in a Swiss bank account.

16:14.572 --> 16:18.009
Now, if we had a ridiculous
sum of money, where would we go?

16:18.776 --> 16:20.011
Dude.

16:27.085 --> 16:28.353
Sweet!

16:31.457 --> 16:33.626
No way we were here last night.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.798
We'd never fit in
at a place like this.

16:38.031 --> 16:41.501
Look everyone!
It's Mr. Jesse and Mr. Chester!

16:52.248 --> 16:55.484
Look at the toggles on that kitten.

16:59.388 --> 17:02.726
Good afternoon, Jesse, Chester.
How are we feeling today?

17:03.493 --> 17:05.062
A little fuzzy.

17:06.096 --> 17:09.867
Hi, Chester. Hi, Jesse.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.336
Did you guys enjoy
yourselves last night?

17:14.705 --> 17:16.808
-Have we met?
-It's me, Tania.

17:17.008 --> 17:18.911
Remember last night
when I gave you...

17:19.111 --> 17:22.848
...that super-special,
slippery-wet lap dance?

17:26.753 --> 17:29.322
Of course. How can I forget?

17:29.956 --> 17:32.059
You want to do it again?

17:32.292 --> 17:35.496
This time, it's on me.

17:43.739 --> 17:45.808
If you say so.

17:54.484 --> 17:56.386
Didn't I get a special lap dance?

17:56.787 --> 17:58.488
Did you ever.

18:10.402 --> 18:11.870
Sweet!

18:12.237 --> 18:13.772
Sweet!

18:14.473 --> 18:15.907
So...

18:16.108 --> 18:20.179
...just how super-special
can a slippery lap dance be?

18:20.613 --> 18:24.884
What the hell were you thinking,
throwing around my money like that?

18:25.084 --> 18:28.655
-You're a....
-I'm a gender-challenged male.

18:29.089 --> 18:30.658
What does that mean?

18:32.493 --> 18:34.629
Oh, dude, you're a dude! That's--

18:35.963 --> 18:37.132
You....

18:47.143 --> 18:50.780
Last night, I had you sneak a suitcase
of stolen money out of here.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.650
-Stolen money?
-$200,000.

18:53.950 --> 18:55.252
$200,000!

18:55.452 --> 18:58.656
I gave you the case and left.
We were supposed to meet.

18:58.856 --> 19:01.926
But you never showed up!
Where's that suitcase?

19:02.259 --> 19:03.928
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

19:14.874 --> 19:17.577
-Where's that suitcase?
-It's in my car.

19:17.777 --> 19:21.314
Then get it. Fast.
Or else you'll be singing soprano.

19:33.261 --> 19:36.298
Dude. Dude, dude!

19:36.765 --> 19:38.233
-We gotta go.
-Are you crazy?

19:38.467 --> 19:40.369
I'm with breakdancing strippers.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.805
Seriously, dude, this is an emergency.

19:43.005 --> 19:44.207
So is this, dude.

19:44.407 --> 19:47.110
It's a breakdancing
stripper emergency.

19:48.078 --> 19:50.480
-Goodbye!
-Bye, Chester!

19:50.680 --> 19:52.182
I love you!

19:53.550 --> 19:57.421
We were supposed to meet her with
the suitcase, but we didn't show up.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.792
Sounds like us.
How wasted were we last night?

20:00.992 --> 20:04.296
I touched Christie's hoo-hoo,
we're on the hook for $200,000...

20:04.497 --> 20:07.667
...that belongs to a transsexual
stripper, and my car's gone.

20:08.100 --> 20:12.071
-I'd say we were pretty wasted.
-We really need to find your car.

20:12.305 --> 20:16.209
Okay, let's see. The last place
we remember being last night was....

20:16.409 --> 20:20.514
The twins'. But we can't show up
without the anniversary gifts.

20:20.715 --> 20:23.684
I got it! We'll get them
a little something for now.

20:23.885 --> 20:28.223
When we find the car, we'll give them
the real gifts. That's a dollar...

20:28.590 --> 20:29.892
...thirty-nine.

20:30.092 --> 20:32.594
-I don't know.
-Trust me.

20:32.828 --> 20:35.297
-It'll be totally cool. Let's go.
-Okay.

20:39.869 --> 20:41.704
We are so dead.

20:42.239 --> 20:43.941
I roger that.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.900
-We've been cleaning all day.
-What do you guys have to say?

21:08.101 --> 21:10.270
Happy anniversary.

21:16.210 --> 21:19.314
We ate the dark ones.
We know you guys don't like those.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.983
Dark ones are the only ones
we do like.

21:23.117 --> 21:24.553
Oh, yeah.

21:25.420 --> 21:29.424
But you could use the box to keep....

21:30.626 --> 21:32.362
You keep...

21:33.630 --> 21:35.031
...ribbons.

21:37.033 --> 21:39.936
-You guys forgot our anniversary.
-No, of course not.

21:40.137 --> 21:43.574
No, we got you guys great gifts.
We just had some car trouble.

21:43.808 --> 21:45.877
We came over here
as soon as we could...

21:46.077 --> 21:47.979
...to help you guys clean up but....

21:48.412 --> 21:49.380
Oh, no.

21:50.882 --> 21:53.018
It looks like you're already done.

21:53.218 --> 21:55.354
All we have to do is
take out the trash.

21:55.554 --> 21:57.690
Guess they haven't been outside yet.

21:58.057 --> 22:00.226
You know what?
We'll take out the trash.

22:00.459 --> 22:02.428
You guys go and take a nice hot bath.

22:02.729 --> 22:05.498
Yeah. You deserve it
after all this hard work.

22:05.698 --> 22:06.967
Pamper yourselves.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.537
-Just....
-Don't make a mess.

22:14.308 --> 22:16.577
Slow and steady, good buddy.

22:16.778 --> 22:17.946
10-4.

22:18.413 --> 22:19.948
-You're tilting.
-Sorry.

22:20.182 --> 22:22.952
-Why are you tilting?
-You gave me the heavy end.

22:29.292 --> 22:31.494
-Let it go, man.
-No, we can get it.

22:31.694 --> 22:33.997
No. Let it go.

22:34.331 --> 22:36.300
We're not leaving it behind.

22:37.534 --> 22:38.502
Okay.

22:39.170 --> 22:41.405
-I'll take my shoe off.
-Okay.

22:45.377 --> 22:46.811
Watch it. Stop pushing!

22:47.012 --> 22:49.348
Watch it! Careful. Careful.

22:52.985 --> 22:55.889
-Are we cool? Are we cool?
-We're still cool.

23:04.665 --> 23:07.268
Now, take your shoe off,
and you get it.

23:09.537 --> 23:12.907
-Okay.
-Get it. That's it, that's it.

23:13.508 --> 23:14.743
I got it!

23:16.812 --> 23:18.247
Oh, my God!

23:24.921 --> 23:26.623
You can't do anything right.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.025
Why do you have to mess everything up?

23:42.241 --> 23:45.844
-I got three words: anger management.
-Yeah!

23:46.044 --> 23:48.848
Dude, we really need
to find your car.

23:56.090 --> 23:58.726
Sorry about yanking you
off the street like that.

23:58.926 --> 24:01.796
-We really need to talk to you.
-Who are you guys?

24:01.996 --> 24:06.100
My name is Zarnoff. This is Zabu,
Zellner, Zilbor, Zelmina...

24:06.334 --> 24:07.836
-...and Jeff.
-Hey.

24:10.005 --> 24:13.842
More specifically, we are
the recipients of instructions...

24:14.043 --> 24:18.581
...from extraterrestrials regarding
the interstellar path to outer space.

24:20.550 --> 24:21.751
Go ahead and laugh.

24:21.952 --> 24:23.987
We are used to being mocked.

24:24.621 --> 24:26.023
Okay.

24:26.356 --> 24:29.627
We have been sent
by our wise and powerful leader...

24:29.827 --> 24:30.828
...Zoltan...

24:31.062 --> 24:34.666
...to find you and recover
the continuum transfunctioner.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.970
Hey, have you guys
ever been to Uranus?

24:38.170 --> 24:40.739
It's supposed to be
nice this time of year.

24:40.940 --> 24:44.143
This is important. We intercepted
an interstellar message...

24:44.343 --> 24:46.712
...that leads us to believe
that last night...

24:46.912 --> 24:50.250
...you were in possession
of the continuum transfunctioner.

24:50.451 --> 24:51.518
Where is it now?

24:51.785 --> 24:54.288
-The who what?
-The continuum transfunctioner...

24:54.521 --> 24:56.991
...is a very mysterious
and powerful device.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.160
-And?
-And its mystery...

24:59.594 --> 25:01.897
...is exceeded only by its power.

25:02.130 --> 25:04.833
Sorry, we don't remember
a thing about last night.

25:05.033 --> 25:06.301
You must be careful.

25:06.501 --> 25:10.306
Danger follows the continuum
transfunctioner. So says....

25:10.506 --> 25:12.942
-Zoltan.
-Zoltan.

25:13.709 --> 25:15.178
I'll tell you what.

25:15.378 --> 25:19.182
We'll keep our eyes out for the
continual trans-ding-a-ling thing...

25:19.383 --> 25:21.618
...and if we see it,
we'll give you a call.

25:21.818 --> 25:23.054
Yes. You must.

25:23.254 --> 25:25.556
But remember,
you are in great danger.

25:25.756 --> 25:26.991
Trust no one.

25:27.292 --> 25:28.459
Except for us.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.262
Thank you, Jeff. Good point.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.664
Trust no one, except for us.

25:32.998 --> 25:34.366
Zoltan.

25:41.674 --> 25:44.711
Wait a second. Let's recap.
Last night, we lost my car...

25:44.912 --> 25:47.714
...we accepted stolen money
from a transsexual stripper...

25:47.914 --> 25:52.120
...and now some space nerds want us
to find something we can't pronounce.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.889
Maybe we should cut back
on the shibbying.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.661
-Thanks, dude.
-Oh, good!

25:59.928 --> 26:03.165
You're right on time.
You pick up special suits.

26:03.799 --> 26:07.937
Mr. Lee, tailor, make special
suits for you. Come on.

26:14.578 --> 26:18.582
-Dude, you got a tattoo!
-What?

26:18.816 --> 26:21.286
-So did you, dude.
-Naw.

26:23.021 --> 26:25.290
-Dude, what does my tattoo say?
-"Sweet"!

26:25.490 --> 26:27.826
-What about mine?
-"Dude." What does mine say?

26:28.026 --> 26:29.127
"Sweet."

26:29.328 --> 26:30.596
-What about mine?
-"Dude."

26:30.829 --> 26:32.331
-What does mine say?
-"Sweet"!

26:32.565 --> 26:34.534
-What about mine?
-"Dude." And mine?

26:34.767 --> 26:36.536
"Sweet." What about mine?

26:36.736 --> 26:38.204
"Dude." What does mine say?

26:38.438 --> 26:40.307
"Sweet"! What about mine?

26:40.541 --> 26:42.409
"Dude." What does mine say?

26:42.609 --> 26:45.312
"Sweet"! What about mine?

26:45.713 --> 26:48.482
"Dude"! What does mine say?

26:48.683 --> 26:50.284
"Sweet"!

26:51.552 --> 26:53.088
Idiots!

26:55.291 --> 26:58.227
Your tattoo says "dude,"
your tattoo says "sweet."

26:58.928 --> 27:00.196
Got it?

27:02.799 --> 27:04.534
Sorry.

27:04.734 --> 27:06.436
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:06.903 --> 27:08.672
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

27:15.847 --> 27:18.817
-Shibby.
-Very sharp, very sharp.

27:19.050 --> 27:22.020
You two number one, extra-special
good-looking guys.

27:22.220 --> 27:24.690
-We got these last night?
-You were pretty--

27:26.892 --> 27:29.095
-How much are these?
-You already pay for.

27:29.328 --> 27:33.566
I just do some minor alterations.
Add the secret pockets you order.

27:33.934 --> 27:36.403
Maybe we got
the continual trans-sphincter.

27:36.604 --> 27:37.738
What's--?

27:38.272 --> 27:39.706
Oh, dude!

27:43.778 --> 27:45.380
Dude!

27:53.255 --> 27:54.791
Sweet!

28:11.075 --> 28:12.077
Cool!

28:12.310 --> 28:15.447
-How did we pay for these suits?
-Oh, you pay cash.

28:15.647 --> 28:19.418
Cold hard cash,
crispy new hundred-dollar bills.

28:20.218 --> 28:22.722
Hey, did you see
what car we were driving?

28:23.122 --> 28:24.957
Me? No, I don't see no car.

28:31.765 --> 28:33.033
Hello?

28:34.702 --> 28:36.671
Dude, we bought cell phones.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.209
That's not all we bought, dude.

29:29.063 --> 29:30.565
Shibby!

30:47.651 --> 30:52.089
Man, I cannot believe
we leased a car last night. God!

30:52.289 --> 30:54.925
-But who's Johnny Potsmoker?
-That's my alter ego.

30:55.126 --> 30:56.861
I thought that was my alter ego.

30:57.062 --> 30:59.331
No, that's my alter ego.

30:59.531 --> 31:02.468
-Your alter ego is Smokey McPot.
-Oh, yeah.

31:04.136 --> 31:06.105
You're never gonna figure that out.

31:07.006 --> 31:08.107
Okay, dude.

31:08.308 --> 31:10.643
There it is. Break time's over.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.545
Time to find my car.

31:12.912 --> 31:15.015
This is impossible.

31:15.549 --> 31:17.484
Are you Jesse and Chester?

31:20.488 --> 31:22.223
Are you Jesse and Chester?

31:23.558 --> 31:25.393
I don't know. Why?

31:25.593 --> 31:27.562
If you are Jesse and Chester...

31:27.796 --> 31:30.266
...perhaps we will give you
erotic pleasure.

31:30.733 --> 31:32.034
-That's us.
-Right here.

31:32.234 --> 31:35.071
We are looking
for the continuum transfunctioner.

31:35.271 --> 31:39.609
-Who are you guys?
-We are not guys. We are hot chicks.

31:40.110 --> 31:42.312
She's totally right.

31:42.513 --> 31:44.181
The continuum transfunctioner...

31:44.381 --> 31:46.450
...is a very mysterious
and powerful device.

31:46.951 --> 31:48.653
-And?
-And its mystery...

31:48.853 --> 31:50.488
...is only exceeded by its power.

31:50.788 --> 31:52.256
That doesn't really help.

32:13.047 --> 32:17.218
We will give you pleasure now, if you
give us the continuum transfunctioner.

32:17.451 --> 32:21.189
Let me get your proposition straight.
First you give us...

32:21.423 --> 32:24.993
...the pleasure, then we give
you the continuum transfunctioner?

32:25.194 --> 32:28.397
No. First you give us
the continuum transfunctioner...

32:28.597 --> 32:30.833
...then we give you the pleasure.

32:31.034 --> 32:33.036
I've heard that one before.

32:33.269 --> 32:34.905
Okay, look. How about this?

32:35.105 --> 32:37.507
You give me pleasure...

32:37.707 --> 32:40.645
...then we'll give you
the continuum transfunctioner.

32:40.845 --> 32:43.147
-If there's time, you do him.
-Dude--

32:43.347 --> 32:44.782
-Deal.
-Sweet!

32:44.983 --> 32:46.617
-Wait a second.
-Thank you.

32:46.818 --> 32:50.054
Come here. Those space nerds
told us not to trust anybody.

32:50.255 --> 32:54.827
Yeah, but for the love of God,
they're offering us oral pleasure!

32:55.027 --> 32:56.429
What--?

32:57.296 --> 32:59.198
-Okay.
-Okay.

32:59.399 --> 33:01.568
Hey. Where did the hot chicks go?

33:04.104 --> 33:06.206
Where's my money, boys?

33:06.941 --> 33:09.377
We were just going to get it.

33:10.578 --> 33:13.548
You picked the wrong
transsexual stripper to screw with.

33:13.781 --> 33:15.650
You're pinching me.

33:16.785 --> 33:19.955
Well, let's see what the cops
have to say about this.

33:20.322 --> 33:22.625
-You're busted.
-Busted.

33:22.925 --> 33:26.462
-B-U-S-T, busted.
-This one.

33:27.263 --> 33:30.433
-These guys.
-Chester! I saw this on COPS!

33:30.634 --> 33:33.470
-Kick hard and hit back!
-Bye-bye, boys.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.238
Put on the siren.

33:37.241 --> 33:40.011
You're sticking to the
"I don't remember" crap.

33:40.245 --> 33:41.679
Yeah. We don't remember.

33:41.913 --> 33:44.049
Last night, your car
was spotted leaving...

33:44.249 --> 33:47.453
-...the scene of a major drug deal.
-You found my car.

33:47.686 --> 33:51.090
You guys got more important things
to worry about right now.

33:51.524 --> 33:54.661
Where were you between
midnight and 2 a.m. last night?

33:54.961 --> 33:58.799
I told you, okay?
We don't remember anything.

33:58.999 --> 34:01.935
I see we're gonna have to do
this the hard way.

34:03.704 --> 34:07.809
Where were you last night between
the hours of midnight and 2 a.m.?

34:08.142 --> 34:10.044
We don't know.

34:19.622 --> 34:20.689
What the--?

34:25.462 --> 34:27.798
-Now do you remember?
-No.

34:38.276 --> 34:40.612
-How about now?
-No.

34:50.256 --> 34:53.059
Hey, leave him alone!
He doesn't know anything!

34:53.994 --> 34:57.364
-Now are you ready to talk?
-Dude, we don't remember!

34:57.998 --> 35:01.202
Okay, here are the whips
you guys wanted.

35:03.271 --> 35:05.306
Hey, it's the donut guys.

35:06.408 --> 35:09.278
These two were at
the Donut House last night.

35:09.478 --> 35:13.081
We started talking and they bought
donuts for the whole precinct.

35:13.282 --> 35:15.284
What time did all this happen?

35:15.518 --> 35:18.488
Let's see. Must've been
between midnight and 2 a.m.

35:19.256 --> 35:20.490
Damn!

35:20.858 --> 35:24.395
You can't be the guys
we're looking for. Sorry.

35:31.002 --> 35:32.103
Hang in there, bro.

35:33.271 --> 35:35.740
-Come on, Kojak.
-All right.

35:36.341 --> 35:38.344
I'm really sorry about all this.

35:38.577 --> 35:41.214
Looks like it was a case
of mistaken identity.

35:41.414 --> 35:44.384
Actually, those are
the real criminals over there.

35:45.918 --> 35:47.086
One of our officers...

35:47.287 --> 35:51.158
-...made a wrong identification.
-Yeah, that was me.

35:51.358 --> 35:52.960
I'm sorry about that, fellas.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.596
Rick will tell you exactly
where your car is.

35:57.565 --> 35:59.601
-We found the car.
-We found the car.

35:59.834 --> 36:01.570
We found the car!

36:01.770 --> 36:03.872
-Yeah, we found the car.
-Found my car.

36:04.106 --> 36:08.377
Now we get the gifts, go to the twins'
house, and get our special treats.

36:08.577 --> 36:10.012
Sweet!

36:10.246 --> 36:12.916
Give us the keys
and we're out of here.

36:13.116 --> 36:14.584
You got it.

36:17.187 --> 36:19.657
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

36:19.857 --> 36:21.259
What's the problem, Rick?

36:21.559 --> 36:23.260
Nothing, I just-- Boy.

36:23.460 --> 36:25.129
Okay. Jeez.

36:26.865 --> 36:30.568
Did you say you wanted your car back,
or you wanted it impounded?

36:31.003 --> 36:33.906
We want the car back, please.

36:34.106 --> 36:37.610
Oh, I see. That's kind of funny,
because what happened was...

36:37.844 --> 36:41.748
...I accidentally sent your car
to the impound.

36:41.948 --> 36:43.383
-Rick.
-I know.

36:43.584 --> 36:45.919
I can definitely tell you this.
You guys...

36:46.119 --> 36:48.322
...can get the car back in a few days.

36:48.522 --> 36:51.926
We don't have a few days, Rick.
We need the car back now.

36:52.927 --> 36:57.399
Say, how about a treat?
There's Bavarian cream.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.137
-Yeah.
-That's a good one there.

37:02.371 --> 37:05.174
-It's good.
-It's great. I have a lot of them.

37:05.374 --> 37:07.343
-You know what? Forget about it.
-Okay.

37:07.577 --> 37:09.980
-Psych!
-Oh, jeez. You got me.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.516
Hey, fellows, who's the goose? Me.

37:13.016 --> 37:14.318
You're such a joker.

37:16.988 --> 37:17.955
One.

37:20.725 --> 37:23.495
-Damn!
-Have you seen Jesse and Chester?

37:23.695 --> 37:26.598
-What?
-We're looking for Jesse and Chester.

37:27.032 --> 37:28.768
I don't know where they are...

37:28.968 --> 37:31.170
...but I bet those punks
over there do.

37:31.971 --> 37:35.675
So then, remember?
I said, "Later, dudes."

37:38.578 --> 37:42.016
-Why were you with those jerks anyway?
-They were just being nice...

37:42.216 --> 37:43.684
...unlike someone I know.

37:43.917 --> 37:46.887
Maybe it's time I find someone
with a sensitive side.

37:47.188 --> 37:49.457
Someone who respects me as a person.

37:49.657 --> 37:52.060
Maybe somebody like Jesse or Chester.

37:55.764 --> 37:58.868
Okay, listen up.
We're gonna find Jesse and Chester.

37:59.068 --> 38:02.072
And when we do, stoner-bashing time!

38:02.305 --> 38:05.175
-Do you know Jesse and Chester?
-Who are you?

38:05.375 --> 38:08.579
-We are hot chicks.
-Yes, you are.

38:08.779 --> 38:11.715
We believe they have
the continuum transfunctioner.

38:12.049 --> 38:15.887
However, if you recover the continuum
transfunctioner from them...

38:16.087 --> 38:19.057
...and bring it to us,
we will give you erotic pleasure.

38:19.290 --> 38:21.060
You've got yourselves a deal.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.596
Okay, guys. Okay, guys, new plan.

38:23.796 --> 38:27.667
First, we find those stoners,
get the continuum transfunctioner...

38:27.867 --> 38:30.904
-...then, it's jerk-bashing time.
-Yeah!

38:31.371 --> 38:32.839
Oh, yeah.

38:33.073 --> 38:35.242
I just remembered where
you might be able to find them.

38:37.311 --> 38:38.278
Send those chicks to meet the twins.

38:38.712 --> 38:41.082
That'll put those dudes
in some hot water.

38:43.818 --> 38:46.688
Try it again. Okay?
Just knock it out of the park.

38:46.888 --> 38:48.456
All right, give it a shot.

38:49.458 --> 38:50.893
Okay, you almost got it.

38:51.093 --> 38:54.897
Now just concentrate on the beep,
swing as hard as you can...

38:55.097 --> 38:57.066
...and keep your ear on the ball.
Okay?

38:57.300 --> 38:59.569
All right, little buddy,
you can do it!

39:04.108 --> 39:06.811
I did it! I did it!
I hit it! I did it!

39:11.182 --> 39:14.219
-Do you know Jesse and Chester?
-Pardon me?

39:14.552 --> 39:17.923
-We're looking for Jesse and Chester.
-Who are you?

39:18.257 --> 39:20.626
We're extremely hot chicks
with big breasts.

39:21.027 --> 39:22.395
Really?

39:23.663 --> 39:26.299
Can I touch your face?
It's the only way I can see...

39:26.499 --> 39:29.069
-...who I'm talking to.
-Okay.

39:30.804 --> 39:34.141
Wow! You are hot.

39:41.649 --> 39:43.652
Is this normal?

39:44.052 --> 39:47.189
Oh, yeah. This is how
blind people shake hands.

39:47.723 --> 39:49.525
-Sammy, you're up next.
-Okay--

39:49.725 --> 39:52.061
-Come on.
-What the--? Sis!

39:52.595 --> 39:55.899
Excuse me, a little help.
Wanda. Wilma.

39:56.099 --> 39:58.869
-Anthony?
-Anthony, what is going on?

39:59.069 --> 40:01.773
Nothing. I was just reading.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.609
Bye, ladies, I need to be alone now.

40:04.809 --> 40:08.046
-We're looking for Jesse and Chester.
-Who are you guys?

40:08.246 --> 40:10.515
We are not guys. We are hot chicks.

40:11.183 --> 40:14.052
We're supposed to meet them later,
but we can't wait.

40:14.620 --> 40:17.991
-We don't know where they are.
-And frankly, we don't care.

40:22.996 --> 40:26.400
-Dude, let's call Nelson.
-Yeah. See if he's home.

40:30.371 --> 40:32.273
-Hello?
-Hey, Nelson, it's Chester.

40:32.573 --> 40:34.876
Hey, Chester! No, it's me, Tommy.

40:35.443 --> 40:37.579
Your buddy Nelson is busy
at the moment.

40:38.147 --> 40:40.282
This is bad karma, boys.

40:41.149 --> 40:44.053
Hey, tell me where
that continuum transfunctioner is.

40:45.287 --> 40:46.689
No hablo English.

40:46.889 --> 40:50.160
Your friend's dead meat unless
I get that continuum transfunctioner.

40:51.628 --> 40:53.430
Jackal! Get your pipe!

40:55.365 --> 40:57.568
-My balls!
-What was that?

40:57.768 --> 41:01.873
Tommy's gotten to Nelson! He knows
about the continuum transfunctioner.

41:02.073 --> 41:05.577
Those double-crossing
sexy, sexy sluts!

41:07.880 --> 41:12.485
I am so sick of hearing about
this continuum transfunctioner thing.

41:12.685 --> 41:16.622
-If one more person asks--
-You got the continuum transfunctioner?

41:16.957 --> 41:18.425
Who are you guys?

41:18.625 --> 41:21.862
We are the keepers
of the continuum transfunctioner.

41:22.462 --> 41:25.900
It is all that stands between
the universe and destruction.

41:26.100 --> 41:28.236
It is a mysterious
and powerful device.

41:28.436 --> 41:31.339
And its mystery
is only exceeded by its power.

41:31.539 --> 41:32.975
-We know.
-We don't have it.

41:33.175 --> 41:34.142
But the universe?

41:34.376 --> 41:36.478
Screw the universe.

41:42.586 --> 41:44.354
Screw the universe?

41:57.368 --> 42:00.205
Chimpanzees often use sticks
as crude tools.

42:00.405 --> 42:02.674
That is one smart primate.

42:06.513 --> 42:08.481
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:08.714 --> 42:10.050
What are you doing here?

42:10.250 --> 42:13.620
We just wanted to see
how that car trouble thing was going.

42:13.921 --> 42:17.524
Oh, the car. It's in the shop.

42:17.758 --> 42:18.726
Really?

42:18.960 --> 42:21.830
The shop run by beautiful women
in black jumpsuits?

42:22.030 --> 42:24.165
The ones you were
hanging with earlier?

42:24.365 --> 42:27.736
-Well, you see, Jesse thought--
-Today's our anniversary.

42:27.936 --> 42:30.839
-Not only do you not have gifts.
-But you guys ditch us...

42:31.040 --> 42:32.508
...for some big-breasted bimbos...

42:32.741 --> 42:35.678
-...while we're cleaning our house....
-Which you trashed.

42:35.878 --> 42:37.113
Twice.

42:37.313 --> 42:39.082
-You're sucky boyfriends.
-But--

42:39.282 --> 42:43.320
We just wanted to come
and tell you in person that it's over.

42:46.023 --> 42:48.793
-Wilma?
-Thank you, Wanda.

42:58.170 --> 43:00.105
-They're totally right.
-Yeah.

43:00.305 --> 43:02.442
We are sucky boyfriends.

43:03.843 --> 43:06.846
Do you even remember
what kind of gifts we got them?

43:07.080 --> 43:10.117
-I bet we got them sucky gifts.
-Yeah.

43:10.717 --> 43:12.453
We suck.

43:19.628 --> 43:23.131
Wait, I just got a really bad feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

43:23.699 --> 43:25.568
You should go sit on the toilet.

43:26.001 --> 43:28.671
No, no.
You know what the feeling is?

43:29.505 --> 43:30.840
It's love.

43:32.876 --> 43:34.778
-Is that what that is?
-Yeah.

43:34.978 --> 43:38.115
I'm in love with Wanda.
And you're in love with Wilma.

43:39.049 --> 43:40.618
But see, now that we know...

43:40.851 --> 43:43.788
...that we've been sucky boyfriends,
we can change.

43:43.988 --> 43:46.791
-We can?
-Yeah. And you know what else?

43:46.991 --> 43:50.629
I'll bet you that we did buy them
super-cool anniversary gifts.

43:50.829 --> 43:52.965
You know why? Because we love them.

43:53.266 --> 43:55.134
Are they wrapped in cool paper?

43:55.401 --> 43:57.670
Yeah. I'll tell you what we'll do.

43:58.037 --> 44:01.541
We'll go to the impound lot, get the car,
which has the gifts in it...

44:01.775 --> 44:05.513
...and then go to the twins' house,
and beg for them to take us back!

44:06.080 --> 44:07.982
Yeah! Let's do it.

44:09.150 --> 44:12.186
No, hold on. I gotta take a crap.

44:12.453 --> 44:13.688
-Told you.
-I know.

44:13.888 --> 44:14.856
I know your body.

44:26.702 --> 44:30.607
Boys, I got some good news.
We just got your car in this morning.

44:31.008 --> 44:32.342
All right!

44:32.542 --> 44:34.111
But the bad news is...

44:34.345 --> 44:37.581
...not only did Officer Boyer
send your car to the impound...

44:37.782 --> 44:41.052
...he tagged it for auction
and it was sold this afternoon.

44:41.419 --> 44:42.387
Rick.

44:43.488 --> 44:47.459
-Do you know who bought the car?
-I have the address right here.

44:47.693 --> 44:49.361
All right.

44:49.562 --> 44:51.997
But it'd be against Regulation...

44:52.198 --> 44:55.736
...457XY2-665 to give it to you.

44:56.002 --> 44:57.404
Come on. Just--

44:59.039 --> 45:01.875
Reaching onto this side
of the counter isn't allowed.

45:02.143 --> 45:05.780
The last guy who tried it ended up
with three broken fingers.

45:09.251 --> 45:11.820
-Reach it.
-You can reach it!

45:12.020 --> 45:14.456
No, I got--
One of these has carpal tunnel.

45:14.656 --> 45:17.260
What if I further injure myself?

45:18.894 --> 45:20.196
I have to do everything.

45:20.396 --> 45:23.833
I'm a better lookout.
My vision's better. You know that.

45:26.436 --> 45:27.838
That's it, that's it.

45:30.207 --> 45:32.910
-Got it!
-We're good, we're good.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.249
-What are you doing?
-Dude, I'm stuck!

45:38.650 --> 45:41.387
-Come on. I'm stuck.
-You seriously stuck?

45:43.689 --> 45:44.724
Don't!

45:46.125 --> 45:47.627
Dude, here she comes! Help!

45:48.495 --> 45:50.029
Get it!

45:57.538 --> 45:59.540
Hold on, hold on. I gotta get--

45:59.774 --> 46:01.342
Okay, okay.

46:03.912 --> 46:05.414
-I got it, I got it.
-Help me!

46:05.647 --> 46:08.083
We'll spit on it.
You know, lubrication.

46:08.284 --> 46:10.119
-That's gross, dude!
-Okay, fine.

46:11.120 --> 46:13.455
-Here she comes.
-Spit! Spit!

46:15.692 --> 46:19.396
Good news. I talked to my supervisor
and he said I could give you...

46:19.596 --> 46:22.199
-...the address after all.
-That's great.

46:23.533 --> 46:25.470
But the bad news is...

46:26.303 --> 46:29.307
...I'm gonna have to
confiscate your pinky.

46:45.358 --> 46:48.728
-All right, next stop, find my car.
-Good.

46:48.928 --> 46:52.333
Hey, check it out.
Totally gay Nordic dudes at 3:00.

46:59.975 --> 47:02.777
Wait. I got an idea.

47:02.978 --> 47:05.514
We just ask for
the continuum transfunctioner?

47:05.748 --> 47:08.885
-Yeah. It's that easy.
-Thank you both very much.

47:09.085 --> 47:12.755
-Hey, don't mention it.
-See you around the galaxy, dudes.

47:16.526 --> 47:17.862
Time to get your car.

47:33.179 --> 47:35.248
The creepy space nerds are back, dude.

47:39.719 --> 47:42.089
Dude, do not worry about them.

47:42.289 --> 47:44.558
Yeah, they're totally harmless.

48:03.813 --> 48:06.249
Now may I have
the continuum transfunctioner?

48:07.284 --> 48:08.585
Not quite yet.

48:08.952 --> 48:13.491
Would you consider giving it to me
while I continue to give you pleasure?

48:14.792 --> 48:15.826
Okay.

48:17.595 --> 48:19.864
-Wake up, dude.
-Oral pleasure?

48:20.298 --> 48:21.333
What?

48:22.934 --> 48:24.002
Nothing.

48:25.571 --> 48:27.873
Get dressed.
We're going to the big house.

48:32.245 --> 48:33.380
Nice outfits.

48:33.580 --> 48:36.583
They're not outfits.
They're interstellar jumpsuits.

48:36.817 --> 48:39.987
-Hey. Nice interstellar jumpsuits.
-Yeah.

48:48.429 --> 48:50.398
Wow! Nice place.

48:50.598 --> 48:52.234
Is this where Zoltan--?

48:52.935 --> 48:55.104
-Is this where Zoltan hangs out?
-No.

48:55.437 --> 48:57.239
This is his parents' house.

48:57.439 --> 48:59.008
We're going over there.

49:00.910 --> 49:02.746
-A barn?
-Is it red?

49:02.946 --> 49:05.315
-No.
-Then it's not a barn!

49:11.855 --> 49:15.160
-This is creepy.
-It's like a country music video.

49:15.627 --> 49:19.331
All right, that's far enough.
You, there. You, over there.

49:19.531 --> 49:21.333
No messing around.

49:22.368 --> 49:24.570
Okay, do you remember which one it is?

49:36.917 --> 49:39.253
-Here, let me show you.
-I'll do it.

49:39.453 --> 49:41.322
-It's that one.
-Hey, grab the--

49:43.825 --> 49:45.027
Keys.

49:47.229 --> 49:51.901
Grab the fire extinguisher
and bonk those dudes on the head.

49:55.105 --> 49:56.939
You want the fire extinguisher?

50:07.685 --> 50:10.155
-Enough!
-No, no, it's that one.

50:10.355 --> 50:11.690
Fudge!

50:28.842 --> 50:30.477
Cool.

50:30.678 --> 50:31.645
What, are you deaf?

50:31.879 --> 50:33.781
Hey, you don't have to be mean.

50:33.981 --> 50:35.883
How are we gonna get out of here?

50:54.238 --> 50:57.675
Your attention, please.
Our imperial commander, Zoltan...

50:57.908 --> 51:00.878
...requests your presence
in the officentary rec room...

51:01.078 --> 51:04.115
...for a Level 7 meeting. Over.

51:25.305 --> 51:27.274
It is now my great pleasure...

51:27.474 --> 51:32.413
...to present to you
our wise and powerful leader...

51:33.248 --> 51:35.751
-...Zoltan.
-Zoltan.

51:35.984 --> 51:37.319
Zoltan.

51:50.367 --> 51:52.402
The time has come, you guys.

51:59.310 --> 52:01.579
We are finally going to fulfill...

52:01.780 --> 52:04.516
...our prophecy of outer space travel.

52:04.716 --> 52:05.985
Zoltan.

52:06.185 --> 52:08.821
They laughed at us
when we said aliens existed.

52:09.021 --> 52:11.725
They mocked us when we wore
bubble-wrap jumpsuits.

52:11.925 --> 52:14.327
But who's laughing now, huh?

52:17.931 --> 52:19.934
I'll tell you who's laughing.
We are!

52:20.167 --> 52:21.234
Zoltan.

52:21.468 --> 52:24.739
Soon we will leave this lame planet...

52:25.039 --> 52:27.742
...and fly through outer space...

52:27.943 --> 52:31.012
...with cool aliens who like us.

52:31.246 --> 52:35.051
It is going to be awesome!

52:35.251 --> 52:36.552
Zoltan!

52:41.324 --> 52:44.594
That's them! They knocked us out
and stole our space suits!

52:45.362 --> 52:47.364
-No, we didn't.
-Yeah, you did!

52:47.698 --> 52:49.166
-No, we didn't.
-Yes, you did!

52:49.400 --> 52:51.202
-No, we didn't.
-Yes, you did!

52:51.402 --> 52:54.839
Hey, who you gonna believe,
us or them?

52:58.443 --> 53:01.280
So you're Jesse and Chester.

53:02.715 --> 53:05.351
I've been looking forward
to meeting you guys...

53:05.551 --> 53:07.754
...although, sorry
it had to be like this.

53:09.188 --> 53:10.290
-Chester!
-Jesse!

53:10.590 --> 53:12.259
-Wanda.
-Wilma!

53:12.693 --> 53:14.928
Normally, we wouldn't
resort to violence...

53:15.129 --> 53:18.299
...but we are dealing with
the continuum transfunctioner.

53:19.200 --> 53:22.637
If you don't deliver it to us,
your girlfriends are history.

53:24.273 --> 53:26.675
Don't worry, girls. We'll save you.

53:26.875 --> 53:28.677
Yeah, you can depend on us.

53:29.979 --> 53:31.413
Enough.

53:31.714 --> 53:36.586
Go now, and bring us
the continuum transfunctioner.

53:37.954 --> 53:41.224
And be quiet on your way out.
My parents are taking a nap.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.238
And then tell us where...

53:53.439 --> 53:56.475
-...the continuum transfunctioner is.
-And then?

53:56.809 --> 53:59.878
-And then we'll be able to go get it.
-And then?

54:03.417 --> 54:05.886
Can I get an order
of shrimp fried rice?

54:10.825 --> 54:13.361
-I don't see the car.
-It better be in there.

54:13.595 --> 54:15.229
I almost lost my pinky for it.

54:16.731 --> 54:20.569
Oh, man, I'm sensing something
very Canadian about this place.

54:27.009 --> 54:28.544
Plan B.

54:32.082 --> 54:33.383
All right.

54:34.117 --> 54:35.385
Are you ready?

54:35.585 --> 54:37.288
Let's do this.

54:37.688 --> 54:41.259
One, two, three.

54:47.432 --> 54:48.500
I'm okay. You okay?

54:50.769 --> 54:51.870
Shibby.

55:27.310 --> 55:30.547
Dude, it's a llama.

55:30.781 --> 55:33.951
It's not a llama. It's an ostrich.

55:34.152 --> 55:36.654
Okay, okay, okay...

55:36.888 --> 55:39.157
...very slowly, let's turn around...

55:40.091 --> 55:42.928
-...and go back the other way.
-Okay.

55:47.800 --> 55:48.968
New plan.

55:49.168 --> 55:53.707
We turn around again, very slowly...

55:53.940 --> 55:57.344
-...and go back the other way.
-Okay.

56:04.218 --> 56:05.887
They're everywhere.

56:08.890 --> 56:09.891
What now?

56:10.458 --> 56:14.229
Hey, I saw this thing
about ostriches on Animal Planet.

56:14.430 --> 56:16.332
-They're llamas, dude.
-No.

56:16.866 --> 56:21.004
What you're supposed to do
is stand very still...

56:21.204 --> 56:24.307
...and eventually,
they'll get bored and go away.

56:29.246 --> 56:30.614
I think it's working.

56:38.857 --> 56:40.659
Stupid llamas!

56:43.162 --> 56:44.397
Chester!

56:48.701 --> 56:50.403
Just get in this car!

56:52.506 --> 56:53.774
Go, go!

56:55.943 --> 56:57.611
What do ostriches eat?

56:57.812 --> 56:59.180
-Why?
-Well...

56:59.380 --> 57:01.349
...if they eat peanuts...

57:01.549 --> 57:04.186
...we can just throw a peanut
and they'll go away.

57:04.586 --> 57:08.490
-We don't have any peanuts.
-Weak! We're screwed!

57:17.935 --> 57:19.903
They're leaving. It worked.

57:20.136 --> 57:21.538
What worked?

57:21.738 --> 57:23.307
Whatever we did!

57:40.326 --> 57:43.596
Now may I have
the continuum transfunctioner?

57:44.864 --> 57:46.332
Not quite yet.

57:46.767 --> 57:47.968
Please?

57:51.772 --> 57:53.107
Scary dream, huh?

57:53.308 --> 57:55.510
What's up? My name is Mark.

57:56.911 --> 58:00.015
-Where are we?
-You're in the punishment room.

58:00.249 --> 58:03.452
This is where he likes to keep
the ostrich poachers.

58:03.786 --> 58:06.155
-Poachers?
-Yeah, that's right.

58:06.356 --> 58:09.959
I've been in this cage for three
years, five months, and 17 days...

58:10.193 --> 58:11.728
...but who's counting?

58:13.797 --> 58:14.765
How's my breath?

58:17.601 --> 58:18.769
That bad, huh?

58:18.969 --> 58:22.506
Where you guys from?
I'm from Connecticut. Hi. Mark.

58:22.807 --> 58:23.775
There we go.

58:24.809 --> 58:26.778
Chester! Get him off!

58:27.145 --> 58:28.446
Pierre!

58:30.048 --> 58:33.119
No, that's not what it looks like.
Maybe a little bit.

58:33.353 --> 58:35.321
-How was your nap?
-Shut up!

58:35.688 --> 58:39.225
Okay. Well, somebody
sure is a Grumpy Gus today.

58:41.895 --> 58:46.300
In France, when a man is caught
poaching ostriches...

58:46.501 --> 58:51.272
...we shave his head, and we make him
run through the fields.

58:51.472 --> 58:53.141
Oh, God, that's the good part.

58:53.341 --> 58:55.544
Once you have seen this...

58:57.579 --> 58:59.882
...you are never quite the same.

59:00.249 --> 59:03.119
-Okay.
-Tell me about it. I used to model.

59:03.687 --> 59:06.022
Lucky for you, I am an honorable man.

59:06.423 --> 59:08.191
A what? I'm sorry?

59:08.592 --> 59:10.861
I said, "I am an honorable man."

59:11.128 --> 59:13.364
I'm sorry, I-- "Honorgable"?

59:13.564 --> 59:15.199
-Honorable.
-"Honorgable."

59:15.399 --> 59:16.801
-Honorable.
-"Honorgable."

59:17.001 --> 59:19.270
-What are you saying?
-Honorable.

59:19.471 --> 59:21.673
I think you're trying
to say honorable.

59:21.874 --> 59:24.610
-Shut up!
-Hey! I'm sorry.

59:25.144 --> 59:28.647
All right, here it is.
I am going to ask you a question.

59:28.881 --> 59:31.384
If you get it right,
I will set you free.

59:31.951 --> 59:35.956
If you get it wrong, well,
you will be spending a lot of time...

59:36.189 --> 59:38.692
...with the ever-popular Mark.

59:40.127 --> 59:41.595
I can be very nice.

59:42.063 --> 59:44.365
All right. Here it is.

59:44.766 --> 59:47.435
What is the average running speed...

59:48.036 --> 59:52.641
...of a full-grown male
African ostrich?

59:52.875 --> 59:54.243
Pass.

59:54.977 --> 59:57.146
-Pass to me. I know it.
-Pass to Mark.

59:57.347 --> 1:00:01.484
You cannot pass! Shut up!
Do I have to hose you down again?

1:00:01.685 --> 1:00:02.886
Don't hose me!

1:00:03.086 --> 1:00:04.154
Maybe later.

1:00:04.488 --> 1:00:07.291
-Dude, we're dead.
-Hey, not so fast.

1:00:08.626 --> 1:00:12.397
The full-grown male African ostrich
or the Latin Struthio camelus...

1:00:12.897 --> 1:00:16.001
...can grow to an average size
of 6 feet, 6 inches...

1:00:16.235 --> 1:00:17.936
...and weigh from 225 to 350 pounds...

1:00:18.604 --> 1:00:21.874
...and can get up to an average speed
of 27 miles per hour.

1:00:22.041 --> 1:00:24.076
This is absolutely correct!

1:00:24.744 --> 1:00:25.745
Animal Planet.

1:00:26.012 --> 1:00:27.547
Well, I said, "Brown."

1:00:27.814 --> 1:00:30.651
Here, let me get you out
of this stinking cage.

1:00:31.552 --> 1:00:34.554
Oh, please forgive me.
Can I get you guys some beers?

1:00:34.788 --> 1:00:36.457
I'd like a near beer, please.

1:00:36.657 --> 1:00:37.625
Shut up!

1:00:37.859 --> 1:00:40.328
We just came about the car
you bought today.

1:00:40.528 --> 1:00:42.363
We wanted to get some stuff out.

1:00:42.563 --> 1:00:45.033
No problem. Right this way.

1:00:45.233 --> 1:00:49.104
-It was nice meeting you guys.
-Good luck with the modeling thing.

1:00:49.305 --> 1:00:52.509
You e-mail me, okay? FreakInCage.com.

1:00:58.181 --> 1:01:02.186
Sacre bleu, the car was here
this afternoon. It-- It--

1:01:02.553 --> 1:01:04.021
It just disappear!

1:01:04.355 --> 1:01:08.893
-How do you just lose a car?
-I'm so sorry, you guys.

1:01:09.127 --> 1:01:12.831
-I feel terrible.
-All right, Pierre, just focus here.

1:01:13.432 --> 1:01:15.267
Was there anything in the car?

1:01:15.901 --> 1:01:17.303
No, nothing.

1:01:17.570 --> 1:01:20.940
Except, of course, for this.

1:01:23.476 --> 1:01:24.677
Dude!

1:01:39.894 --> 1:01:43.098
Dude, I'm having my next
birthday party here for sure.

1:01:43.299 --> 1:01:44.466
Yeah, me too.

1:01:49.139 --> 1:01:50.473
Cool.

1:01:51.007 --> 1:01:53.577
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where locker 206 is?

1:01:53.811 --> 1:01:55.379
Yeah, it's right over there.

1:01:55.612 --> 1:01:57.748
It's you guys!
Dude, you guys played...

1:01:57.981 --> 1:02:00.218
...an amazing round
of putt-putt last night.

1:02:01.386 --> 1:02:03.154
-We did?
-Oh, yeah.

1:02:03.789 --> 1:02:05.757
-Thanks, dude.
-Shibby.

1:02:06.825 --> 1:02:08.093
Here it is.

1:02:08.427 --> 1:02:11.798
-I sure hope my money's in there.
-Yep.

1:02:11.998 --> 1:02:14.434
-Who are you?
-This is my boyfriend, Patty.

1:02:14.634 --> 1:02:16.036
Nice to meet you.

1:02:16.336 --> 1:02:18.205
How do you keep popping up?

1:02:19.206 --> 1:02:22.376
Less questions,
more giving me my money.

1:02:25.980 --> 1:02:28.149
Well, I guess this is it.

1:02:28.449 --> 1:02:30.752
Yep. The moment of truth.

1:02:31.119 --> 1:02:35.124
It's been a long, strange trip, dude.

1:02:35.357 --> 1:02:37.326
It sure has, Jesse.

1:02:38.060 --> 1:02:40.530
Hey! I've got a plane to catch.

1:02:40.763 --> 1:02:42.665
Okay, okay, okay.

1:02:47.738 --> 1:02:50.241
Oh, my suitcase!

1:02:54.712 --> 1:02:57.349
Oh, my God! You guys are the best.

1:02:57.815 --> 1:02:59.684
Thank you so much.

1:03:05.057 --> 1:03:08.795
Thanks for your help, fella.
Good work.

1:03:11.898 --> 1:03:14.968
Are we supposed to be
grossed out by this, or...?

1:03:15.202 --> 1:03:16.904
I don't know.

1:03:17.605 --> 1:03:19.073
Bye.

1:03:21.041 --> 1:03:22.944
Look at this stuff.

1:03:23.745 --> 1:03:25.847
Captain Stu tickets.

1:03:26.314 --> 1:03:27.949
Awesome!

1:03:28.584 --> 1:03:31.053
Oh, jellybeans.

1:03:33.522 --> 1:03:35.257
No jellybeans.

1:03:36.525 --> 1:03:38.027
Cool straw.

1:03:38.895 --> 1:03:40.931
-I'm gonna keep this.
-Yeah.

1:03:54.279 --> 1:03:56.281
I don't see a
continuum transfunctioner.

1:03:56.514 --> 1:04:00.286
Wait a second. What do we know
about the continuum transfunctioner?

1:04:00.486 --> 1:04:02.955
It's a very mysterious
and powerful device.

1:04:03.155 --> 1:04:04.123
And?

1:04:04.357 --> 1:04:07.327
And its mystery
is only exceeded by its power.

1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:10.097
But has anyone ever said
what it looks like?

1:04:11.999 --> 1:04:13.067
No.

1:04:13.334 --> 1:04:14.635
They haven't.

1:04:25.915 --> 1:04:27.983
That was Jesse and Chester.

1:04:28.484 --> 1:04:31.521
They've got
the continuum transfunctioner!

1:04:33.323 --> 1:04:35.058
Quick! To my mother's minivan!

1:04:40.431 --> 1:04:42.033
That was Jesse and Chester.

1:04:42.266 --> 1:04:44.669
They've got
the continuum transfunctioner.

1:04:46.604 --> 1:04:48.907
Quick! To my step dad's pickup truck!

1:04:51.443 --> 1:04:53.845
I'm getting the hang
of this thing, dude.

1:04:56.782 --> 1:04:58.151
Yes!

1:04:59.919 --> 1:05:03.323
Oh, yes! I finally beat you!

1:05:04.057 --> 1:05:06.026
You. You're a competitor.

1:05:06.994 --> 1:05:10.464
Oh, boy. You got me the first nine,
but not number 10.

1:05:11.299 --> 1:05:12.299
Not gonna happen.

1:05:13.768 --> 1:05:15.403
-Final showdown time.
-Chester.

1:05:15.637 --> 1:05:17.105
-Jesse.
-Don't worry, girls.

1:05:17.572 --> 1:05:19.541
We're here to save the day.

1:05:20.008 --> 1:05:23.178
Quit it. These things are expensive.

1:05:24.079 --> 1:05:28.117
Enough! Do you have
the continuum transfunctioner or not?

1:05:29.152 --> 1:05:30.554
Right here.

1:05:31.387 --> 1:05:34.558
-Now release the girls.
-First give up the transfunctioner.

1:05:34.792 --> 1:05:38.696
-First release the girls.
-First give us the transfunctioner.

1:05:38.896 --> 1:05:40.264
Same time.

1:05:42.767 --> 1:05:43.902
Yes!

1:05:48.573 --> 1:05:49.842
There they are.

1:05:50.342 --> 1:05:53.612
Okay, stoners, where's
the continuum transfunctioner?

1:06:04.358 --> 1:06:05.960
Release dodo bird.

1:06:09.798 --> 1:06:11.599
-Tommy, you're such a jerk.
-Yeah.

1:06:11.900 --> 1:06:15.304
-That's our continuum transfunctioner.
-Well, now it's mine.

1:06:16.705 --> 1:06:17.973
Nerd.

1:06:22.812 --> 1:06:25.515
-Dude, let's get out of here.
-Yeah.

1:06:27.150 --> 1:06:29.720
Where is the
continuum transfunctioner?

1:06:29.954 --> 1:06:31.188
We don't have it.

1:06:31.388 --> 1:06:35.259
But we'd like you to meet
our girlfriends, Wanda and Wilma.

1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:36.661
We've already met.

1:06:36.895 --> 1:06:40.599
-Stay away from our boyfriends.
-You fake-breasted sluts.

1:06:42.367 --> 1:06:44.670
Okay, let's go this way.

1:06:46.639 --> 1:06:49.643
Halt. Where is the
continuum transfunctioner?

1:06:49.876 --> 1:06:52.212
You want to go talk
to that guy over there.

1:06:52.579 --> 1:06:54.113
Let the pleasure begin.

1:06:54.347 --> 1:06:56.550
That's not the
continuum transfunctioner.

1:06:57.084 --> 1:06:58.152
Of course, it is.

1:07:01.822 --> 1:07:03.791
Follow the kids.
Come on, follow them.

1:07:03.991 --> 1:07:05.927
Go, go, go.

1:07:19.809 --> 1:07:21.945
Nerd-bashing time.

1:07:22.412 --> 1:07:23.714
It's not our fault.

1:07:23.914 --> 1:07:24.982
It was them.

1:07:25.416 --> 1:07:28.252
Looking for a Smokey McPot.

1:07:28.452 --> 1:07:31.689
I have a delivery
for a Smokey McPot.

1:07:31.889 --> 1:07:34.426
-You ordered pizza?
-I figured we'd get hungry.

1:07:34.659 --> 1:07:36.895
Oh, no, it's you two!

1:07:37.563 --> 1:07:38.797
Look, I almost got it.

1:07:38.997 --> 1:07:42.902
You're really starting to irk me
with your Rubik's Cube fixation!

1:07:43.102 --> 1:07:44.571
Sweet!

1:07:57.184 --> 1:07:59.053
No wonder they're so impossible.

1:07:59.353 --> 1:08:02.023
You've activated the
continuum transfunctioner.

1:08:02.223 --> 1:08:03.458
What's going on?

1:08:03.659 --> 1:08:06.561
Once all five of the
dirugian crystals stop flashing...

1:08:06.795 --> 1:08:08.698
...the universe will be destroyed.

1:08:08.898 --> 1:08:10.132
How do you know?

1:08:10.332 --> 1:08:12.735
We intercepted
interstellar transmissions.

1:08:12.936 --> 1:08:14.971
-Zoltan.
-Nerds.

1:08:15.405 --> 1:08:16.607
Way to go, Chester.

1:08:16.840 --> 1:08:18.241
Sorry.

1:08:18.542 --> 1:08:20.678
You must give it to us
to deactivate it.

1:08:20.911 --> 1:08:23.247
We are the keepers
of the transfunctioner.

1:08:23.448 --> 1:08:25.683
They will use it
to destroy the universe.

1:08:25.884 --> 1:08:29.287
No, we are the keepers
of the continuum transfunctioner.

1:08:29.487 --> 1:08:32.591
-They want to destroy the universe.
-Stop copying us.

1:08:32.825 --> 1:08:34.860
-Stop copying us.
-Stop copying us.

1:08:35.127 --> 1:08:36.896
-Stop copying us.
-Bitch.

1:08:37.496 --> 1:08:40.934
Don't you guys remember?
We came to this planet last night...

1:08:41.167 --> 1:08:43.870
...to escape the clutches
of those evil space sluts.

1:08:44.071 --> 1:08:47.407
-We met you here.
-You gave us a ride to our spaceship.

1:08:47.608 --> 1:08:50.778
And we realized we'd lost
the continuum transfunctioner.

1:08:51.713 --> 1:08:54.315
Hurry, there's only three
blinking lights left.

1:08:54.949 --> 1:08:55.917
Bye-bye, universe.

1:08:56.151 --> 1:08:59.321
He's right, dude.
We're gonna make the wrong decision.

1:08:59.822 --> 1:09:03.459
You know what, dude? I refuse
to let us go down in history...

1:09:03.692 --> 1:09:05.961
...as the dudes
who destroyed the universe.

1:09:06.162 --> 1:09:09.666
How do we find out
which ones are the true keepers?

1:09:09.900 --> 1:09:12.870
It's simple. We ask them
a question about last night...

1:09:13.070 --> 1:09:16.240
...that only the ones that are
telling the truth would know.

1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:18.409
But we can't remember a thing.

1:09:20.211 --> 1:09:21.979
-You gotta hurry.
-Not now, Jeff.

1:09:22.247 --> 1:09:23.281
Zip it.

1:09:26.218 --> 1:09:29.288
If we really did give one of you guys
a ride last night...

1:09:29.521 --> 1:09:31.490
...then you'll know
the answer to this.

1:09:34.060 --> 1:09:35.528
Hurry!

1:09:36.763 --> 1:09:39.800
What score did we get
on the 18th hole...

1:09:40.034 --> 1:09:42.403
...of the miniature golf course
last night?

1:09:49.411 --> 1:09:50.678
You got a hole in one.

1:09:50.912 --> 1:09:53.148
That is...

1:09:57.119 --> 1:09:58.087
...correct!

1:10:08.299 --> 1:10:10.768
Deactivation complete.

1:10:19.644 --> 1:10:23.048
Wait. If you guys don't remember
a thing about last night....

1:10:23.248 --> 1:10:26.185
-How do you know they told the truth?
-It's simple.

1:10:26.852 --> 1:10:27.820
The pudding!

1:10:31.090 --> 1:10:33.393
-You guys had a plan!
-And it actually worked.

1:10:38.398 --> 1:10:39.566
For the love of God!

1:10:42.737 --> 1:10:45.106
Wow! Morphing is cool!

1:10:52.814 --> 1:10:56.686
Whoa! That is one
super hot giant alien!

1:11:01.692 --> 1:11:02.826
Just go!

1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:04.695
-Chester!
-Jesse!

1:11:09.801 --> 1:11:11.236
That is amazing!

1:11:11.436 --> 1:11:15.307
Yeah. Those are the biggest
hoo-hoos I have ever seen.

1:11:17.876 --> 1:11:19.411
Do you spit or swallow?

1:11:19.645 --> 1:11:20.746
Swallow!

1:11:25.818 --> 1:11:29.523
We will now use the power
of the continuum transfunctioner...

1:11:29.723 --> 1:11:31.826
...to banish you
to Hoboken, New Jersey.

1:11:37.398 --> 1:11:40.869
-What are we supposed to do now?
-I think we run, dude!

1:11:51.848 --> 1:11:53.683
Boy, those guys are in a hurry.

1:12:03.061 --> 1:12:07.198
-I want to go on that ride, Daddy.
-Me too, son. Me too.

1:12:22.882 --> 1:12:25.719
-What do we do with this?
-You've gotta activate...

1:12:25.919 --> 1:12:28.255
...the photon accelerator
annihilation beam!

1:12:28.456 --> 1:12:32.293
-The what?
-They said, "the photon accelerator...

1:12:32.493 --> 1:12:35.830
...annihilation beam," you fool!

1:12:36.365 --> 1:12:37.733
Hurry, activate it, dude!

1:12:42.571 --> 1:12:44.640
-This is it!
-Thanks, Captain Obvious!

1:12:46.776 --> 1:12:47.744
I can't reach it!

1:12:47.977 --> 1:12:50.414
Deep in your consciousness,
you must look!

1:12:50.981 --> 1:12:53.851
Concentrate on
the knowledge inside, you must!

1:12:54.518 --> 1:12:56.554
Does he have to talk like that?

1:12:56.821 --> 1:12:58.289
I like the way he talks.

1:13:04.830 --> 1:13:07.399
Chimpanzees often use sticks
as crude tools.

1:13:07.700 --> 1:13:09.134
I've got it!

1:13:15.741 --> 1:13:17.243
Oh, boy!

1:13:22.516 --> 1:13:23.951
We saved the universe!

1:13:24.151 --> 1:13:25.753
The big bitch is dead!

1:13:40.269 --> 1:13:44.274
Damn! Now those are
some big-ass panties.

1:13:45.041 --> 1:13:49.480
-Honey, could you give me a hand?
-No, Tommy. I've found somebody else.

1:13:55.554 --> 1:13:57.122
Jesse and Chester saved us.

1:13:57.355 --> 1:14:00.325
You'll still take us
to outer space with you, right?

1:14:00.559 --> 1:14:03.595
There is a party in the Crab Nebula.
You can come too.

1:14:04.196 --> 1:14:05.164
Crab Nebula!

1:14:10.837 --> 1:14:13.807
-Here you go.
-Thanks for your help.

1:14:14.007 --> 1:14:17.845
-Jesse and Chester.
-You've ensured the universe's safety.

1:14:18.045 --> 1:14:19.480
Well, that's cool and all...

1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:21.983
...but, dude, where's my car?

1:14:22.250 --> 1:14:24.085
You mean you guys don't remember?

1:14:24.285 --> 1:14:27.722
-Damn, you were wasted last night.
-Now, we must eliminate...

1:14:27.956 --> 1:14:29.558
...knowledge of this encounter.

1:14:30.259 --> 1:14:32.328
No. We have so many questions...

1:14:32.561 --> 1:14:34.630
...we want to ask you
about the universe.

1:14:35.064 --> 1:14:37.634
-Like what?
-Well....

1:14:41.772 --> 1:14:43.941
Have you guys
ever been to Uranus?

1:14:44.175 --> 1:14:45.643
Nice!

1:15:00.259 --> 1:15:02.762
-Morning, guys.
-Morning, Gene.

1:15:05.565 --> 1:15:06.900
We'll go to the twins'.

1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:09.470
-And then?
-Then we'll give them their gifts.

1:15:09.670 --> 1:15:11.805
-And then?
-We'll apologize for the house.

1:15:12.039 --> 1:15:13.974
-And then?
-We get our special treats.

1:15:14.174 --> 1:15:16.211
-And then?
-Dude, that's really annoying.

1:15:16.444 --> 1:15:17.611
Sorry.

1:15:17.845 --> 1:15:19.180
Dude, where's my car?

1:15:22.050 --> 1:15:23.185
Dude, where's my car?

1:15:24.052 --> 1:15:25.554
Where's your car, dude?

1:15:29.359 --> 1:15:31.160
Dude, there's your car.

1:15:36.367 --> 1:15:38.335
"I heart you."

1:15:38.936 --> 1:15:41.739
You guys are great boyfriends.

1:15:43.207 --> 1:15:46.878
-And we have something for you too.
-A very special treat.

1:15:47.679 --> 1:15:49.247
Shibby!

1:15:50.582 --> 1:15:51.550
Ta-da!

1:15:52.050 --> 1:15:54.320
We sewed the names on ourselves.

1:15:54.887 --> 1:15:56.355
Wow.

1:15:57.190 --> 1:15:58.157
Put them on.

1:16:04.965 --> 1:16:06.433
You guys look great.

1:16:09.837 --> 1:16:11.405
In berets?

1:16:12.206 --> 1:16:13.308
What are these?

1:16:14.109 --> 1:16:16.011
More gifts.

1:16:18.146 --> 1:16:20.750
-They're beautiful.
-Where did you guys get these?

1:16:21.417 --> 1:16:22.384
This...

1:16:22.618 --> 1:16:24.053
...place.

1:16:24.988 --> 1:16:26.489
-Wow.
-Me first.

1:16:27.757 --> 1:16:29.859
"Thanks for helping
to save the universe.

1:16:30.093 --> 1:16:32.596
Hope your girls like these gifts.
You will. "

1:16:32.963 --> 1:16:35.699
How wasted were we last night?

1:16:41.306 --> 1:16:43.842
-Sweet!
-Dude!

1:16:57.958 --> 1:16:59.526
-Is anyone hungry?
-Yeah.

1:16:59.894 --> 1:17:02.363
-I could go for Chinese food.
-Sounds great.

1:17:02.563 --> 1:17:03.531
Sweet!

1:17:09.437 --> 1:17:12.073
-My back itches, dude.
-Jesse, you got a tattoo.

1:17:12.307 --> 1:17:13.976
Oh, my God. So do you, Chester.

1:17:14.209 --> 1:17:16.612
-No way. What's mine say?
-"Dude."

1:17:16.812 --> 1:17:18.514
-What about mine?
-"Sweet."

1:17:18.714 --> 1:17:20.817
-Yeah, but what does mine say?
-"Dude"!

1:17:21.050 --> 1:17:22.619
-What about mine?
-"Sweet."

1:17:22.852 --> 1:17:25.622
I know, they're sweet,
but, dude, what's mine say?

1:17:25.822 --> 1:17:26.790
"Dude"!

1:17:27.024 --> 1:17:29.026
-What about mine?
-"Sweet"!

1:17:42.441 --> 1:17:44.076
I can do sexy.

1:17:45.344 --> 1:17:47.413
How do you keep popping up like this?

1:17:50.283 --> 1:17:52.919
Come on, this isn't fair.
They're mooning us.

1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:54.555
Sweet, dude.

1:17:54.755 --> 1:17:55.923
It's good, right?

1:18:00.027 --> 1:18:01.128
-Sweet!
-Dude!

1:18:01.362 --> 1:18:04.032
-I am fun-loving. I like charades.
-Shut up!

1:18:04.433 --> 1:18:05.867
Go ahead and laugh.

1:18:08.904 --> 1:18:10.405
Hold on a second.

1:18:25.055 --> 1:18:26.057
Zoltan!

1:18:37.903 --> 1:18:38.738
That's a keeper.

1:18:39.105 --> 1:18:40.106
Fingers crossed.

1:18:43.008 --> 1:18:44.177
I got it!

1:18:44.844 --> 1:18:46.479
You want a piece of this?

1:18:48.648 --> 1:18:50.350
-Dude!
-Sweet!

1:18:50.651 --> 1:18:53.521
-And then?
-And then we went and--

1:18:53.787 --> 1:18:56.891
-And then?
-Got those sweet jumpsuits so we--

1:18:57.125 --> 1:19:00.061
-And then?
-Then we went and-- I'm losing it.

1:19:00.328 --> 1:19:02.597
I am fun-loving, without my clothes.

1:19:02.798 --> 1:19:06.803
The platonic--
The gray thing, dummy!

1:19:07.103 --> 1:19:08.471
-Dude!
-Sweet!

1:19:14.844 --> 1:19:17.347
Can we cut?

1:19:17.648 --> 1:19:19.250
We gotta cut. We have to.

1:19:19.750 --> 1:19:20.851
You have to cut.

1:19:21.085 --> 1:19:22.386
You guys have to cut.

1:19:23.054 --> 1:19:24.121
Cut!

1:19:26.091 --> 1:19:27.359
Punk-ass kids!

1:23:02.300 --> 1:23:03.635
And then?
