Previously on "Legends"...

00:02.535 --> 00:04.571
What are you going to do with him?

00:04.863 --> 00:06.035
Dmitry...

00:07.139 --> 00:09.712
I saw him kill your brother.

00:10.012 --> 00:12.713
I'll relax when the
bastard's back in custody.

00:13.032 --> 00:14.493
You didn't say he would be here.

00:14.528 --> 00:16.409
They were afraid you wouldn't come.

00:16.444 --> 00:17.954
Tamir, it's late.

00:17.989 --> 00:19.523
My children are sleeping.

00:19.557 --> 00:22.028
You'll get the rest when
the work is done in Prague.

00:22.093 --> 00:23.746
Everything's ready for you.

00:23.842 --> 00:26.592
Memorize this number. If
you get into trouble, call.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.627
Now you are Chechen.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.251
This all must be strange to you.

00:52.417 --> 00:53.755
But Chechnya

00:53.790 --> 00:56.383
is where your father wanted you to be.

00:57.613 --> 00:59.712
You remember your father?

01:00.479 --> 01:01.654
Not really.

01:01.689 --> 01:05.239
He was barely older
than you when I met him.

01:05.404 --> 01:06.989
He was strong,

01:07.024 --> 01:08.647
a warrior.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.321
How did he die?

01:14.426 --> 01:16.614
My mum won't talk about it.

01:19.227 --> 01:21.110
He was murdered.

01:22.572 --> 01:24.781
By coward gangsters.

01:25.666 --> 01:27.542
Was he a gangster, too?

01:27.577 --> 01:29.744
Everything he did

01:30.062 --> 01:32.905
was for family, for homeland.

01:33.604 --> 01:35.306
You were too young to remember,

01:35.375 --> 01:37.148
but after he died,

01:37.183 --> 01:40.024
I tried to bring you and your mother here.

01:42.428 --> 01:45.661
Your father would be glad
to know you are finally home.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.179
I saw you watching that phone.

02:01.214 --> 02:03.198
I know what you're thinking.

02:04.015 --> 02:06.582
Why am I being treated like a prisoner?

02:06.617 --> 02:08.794
Your uncle will be here in a few days,

02:08.829 --> 02:10.535
then everything will be better.

02:10.570 --> 02:11.948
You'll see.

02:14.286 --> 02:17.819
_

02:17.890 --> 02:21.448
Funny how things turn out.

02:22.697 --> 02:24.930
Dmitry saved my life,

02:24.965 --> 02:27.215
and now I'm going to take his.

02:30.069 --> 02:32.030
He put a gun

02:32.065 --> 02:34.535
in my face when I was a boy.

02:34.858 --> 02:37.430
I had nightmares for years.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.786
Uncle,

02:41.160 --> 02:43.084
let me kill him for you.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.037
Our friends arrive today.

02:45.072 --> 02:47.509
I need you here to take care of things.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.749
I'll handle Dmitry...

02:49.878 --> 02:51.260
myself.

02:59.458 --> 03:00.843
What kind of a job?

03:00.925 --> 03:02.388
Well, all Tamir would say on the phone

03:02.423 --> 03:05.056
is that he needs an extra bodyguard today.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.302
- You should wear a wire.
- No wire.

03:07.389 --> 03:09.861
- No follow car.
- So what?

03:09.896 --> 03:11.450
We're just supposed to set you
loose and cross our fingers?

03:11.524 --> 03:14.037
I'm not gonna get caught
and get a bullet in my brain.

03:15.405 --> 03:16.731
Fine, but your mobile stays on

03:16.766 --> 03:18.349
so we can track you.

03:18.501 --> 03:21.150
Did you find anything on Tamir's computer?

03:21.185 --> 03:23.081
Financial transactions.

03:23.116 --> 03:26.045
Money filtered through
dozens of shell corporations.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.956
Could be tied to terrorism,
could be totally clean.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.192
Anything about Kate?

03:32.287 --> 03:33.902
No, sorry.

03:34.559 --> 03:36.954
If we find anything
actionable, we'll let you know.

03:36.989 --> 03:39.155
Watch your back, Martin.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.907
_

03:52.044 --> 03:53.814
Looks like a retaliation.

03:53.849 --> 03:55.435
For what?

03:56.472 --> 03:58.472
"For Kost."

03:58.600 --> 03:59.932
The pimp from the Nemcek crew

03:59.967 --> 04:02.648
we told you was missing.

04:03.751 --> 04:05.366
Excuse me.

04:08.487 --> 04:09.754
Hello.

04:11.541 --> 04:13.950
This wasn't Czech gangsters.

04:13.985 --> 04:15.484
It was Dmitry.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.920
Because we blackmailed him?

04:16.954 --> 04:19.875
We showed Dmitry some
photographs, that's all.

04:19.910 --> 04:22.172
And it cost a man his life.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.829
Ilyana.

04:26.022 --> 04:28.012
What if she was complicit?

04:28.047 --> 04:29.120
You think Dmitry...

04:29.173 --> 04:30.315
Told her about the photographs

04:30.350 --> 04:32.326
and the threat we made.

04:33.283 --> 04:35.041
Take Doku out of the picture.

04:35.076 --> 04:37.732
If we can get Ilyana alone,
threaten to lock her up,

04:37.767 --> 04:40.101
that she'll never hold her kid again...

04:40.644 --> 04:41.881
she'll talk.

04:45.249 --> 04:47.588
Where is he? I-I want to see him.

04:49.183 --> 04:51.984
He's my brother, let me go.

04:52.069 --> 04:53.447
I said let me go!

04:53.482 --> 04:55.541
I want to see him!

04:55.618 --> 04:59.381
Let me go! I want to see my brother.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.669
The FBI agent blackmails you

05:10.704 --> 05:12.738
and the next day, Doku is dead.

05:12.773 --> 05:14.856
Tell me that's a coincidence.

05:16.286 --> 05:18.444
He had lots of enemies.

05:21.017 --> 05:22.590
So, we decoded the message

05:22.672 --> 05:25.325
that Ilyana delivered
to Doku from the general.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.616
He wants to be moved back
to Chechnya immediately.

05:29.815 --> 05:31.230
He's getting nervous.

05:31.288 --> 05:33.025
But with Doku dead,

05:33.123 --> 05:35.807
he may turn to someone
else to get him there.

05:35.842 --> 05:37.321
Tamir could convince the general

05:37.356 --> 05:39.077
to stick to the plan.

05:39.231 --> 05:40.545
The junkie brother?

05:40.606 --> 05:41.418
Well, Tamir would have

05:41.453 --> 05:44.304
to clean up his act, but...

05:48.235 --> 05:50.019
Make it happen.

05:52.411 --> 05:54.176
I want passports and new identities

05:54.211 --> 05:56.872
for Ilyana and her daughter...
real ones, this time.

05:56.907 --> 05:59.391
Doku's dead... there's no
longer any threat to them.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.705
She risked her life for us, Terrence.

06:02.421 --> 06:04.422
Get the damn passports.

06:08.364 --> 06:13.069
Mrs. Zakayeva, my deepest condolences.

06:14.495 --> 06:17.879
How long were you and Mr. Zakayev together?

06:18.082 --> 06:19.656
Seven years.

06:20.079 --> 06:21.689
We met in Chechnya.

06:21.724 --> 06:23.331
Right.

06:24.139 --> 06:26.556
And you loved your husband?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.738
Of course, yes, I loved him.

06:30.773 --> 06:33.778
Do you also love Dmitry Petrovich?

06:42.808 --> 06:44.835
We know that Dmitry killed your husband,

06:44.902 --> 06:47.695
and we think you know that, too.

06:48.546 --> 06:49.483
Now...

06:49.518 --> 06:51.399
you can cooperate with us,

06:51.457 --> 06:53.557
maybe you don't go to prison.

06:55.513 --> 06:57.179
Think of Katya.

07:02.608 --> 07:04.692
I don't know anything.

07:07.298 --> 07:09.810
Don't... lie to us!

07:09.868 --> 07:11.610
You think Dmitry loves you?

07:11.645 --> 07:12.908
He's using you,

07:12.943 --> 07:15.441
and when he is done,
he's going to leave you.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.675
Save yourself, Ilyana.

07:19.966 --> 07:21.589
You two,

07:21.624 --> 07:22.823
now.

07:39.444 --> 07:41.761
Who authorized those photos?

07:43.832 --> 07:45.458
Those photos are proof...

07:45.493 --> 07:47.345
Of what, an affair?

07:47.380 --> 07:48.292
Motive.

07:48.327 --> 07:49.803
The crime scene evidence

07:49.838 --> 07:52.456
- tells a different story, Ballard.
- Just let me go back in there

07:52.491 --> 07:53.886
- and do my...
- And yell some more

07:53.921 --> 07:56.107
at a grieving widow?

07:56.341 --> 07:58.110
You're out of control.

07:58.149 --> 07:59.762
I'm phoning your boss

07:59.810 --> 08:02.777
and getting you sent back to the States.

08:04.113 --> 08:05.313
Please.

08:14.340 --> 08:15.858

08:15.893 --> 08:17.006
Gabi...

08:17.041 --> 08:19.321

08:19.740 --> 08:23.465

10:34.257 --> 10:35.808
Three months ago,

10:35.843 --> 10:36.926
a construction company

10:36.961 --> 10:39.347
co-owned by Tamir Zakayev

10:39.382 --> 10:43.182
won a bid to repave part
of the Evropská Highway.

10:43.371 --> 10:45.636
It's the main route between
the city and the airport

10:45.671 --> 10:46.832
and, starting tomorrow,

10:46.916 --> 10:48.377
hundreds of dignitaries will be arriving

10:48.412 --> 10:49.861
for the NATO/Russia summit.

10:49.896 --> 10:50.953
And you think, what?

10:50.988 --> 10:53.069
He used the job as cover
to sabotage the road,

10:53.104 --> 10:54.098
plant a bomb?

10:54.133 --> 10:55.817
Possibly, yes.

10:55.852 --> 10:58.307
I want road closures,
bomb squads, sniffer dogs,

10:58.342 --> 11:01.012
every inch of that highway
searched and secured.

11:01.047 --> 11:02.200
I want background checks

11:02.289 --> 11:04.483
on every person who worked on that job.

11:04.518 --> 11:06.243
Any questions?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.962
Then get on it.

11:09.373 --> 11:11.267
This is good intel, Miskova.

11:12.335 --> 11:14.284
Who's your source?

11:14.751 --> 11:16.091
There's no source.

11:16.126 --> 11:19.143
I cross-referenced some data
I found on Tamir's computer.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.569
Realized he owned part of the company.

11:22.665 --> 11:24.215
That's all.

11:40.210 --> 11:41.822
Back to business.

11:41.858 --> 11:43.144
Just like old times.

11:43.179 --> 11:47.418
Yes, just like old times.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.414
_

11:57.348 --> 11:59.518
_

12:00.088 --> 12:02.670

13:06.538 --> 13:07.967

13:14.798 --> 13:15.977
Mama!

13:20.720 --> 13:23.308

14:02.954 --> 14:05.052
_

14:07.957 --> 14:10.844
_

14:28.111 --> 14:29.650
Are you all right?

14:29.776 --> 14:30.929
Of course I'm not.

14:30.964 --> 14:31.757
Where's Tamir?

14:31.792 --> 14:33.808
Outside, I think. Why?

14:35.347 --> 14:37.658
Did you know about the photographs?

14:37.869 --> 14:39.205
What?

14:39.565 --> 14:41.273
The police, they think you killed Doku.

14:41.317 --> 14:43.376
They say if I don't help
them, I go to prison.

14:43.411 --> 14:44.840
I never see Katya again.

14:44.916 --> 14:46.195
Listen, what did you tell them?

14:46.230 --> 14:47.897
Nothing.

14:48.050 --> 14:50.522
But you have to get us out of here.

14:53.781 --> 14:56.115
A few more days, I promise.

15:06.288 --> 15:07.454
Dmitry!

15:10.394 --> 15:12.174
I have cop friend.

15:12.799 --> 15:15.294
Say Doku was killed by
shitbag in Kost's gang.

15:15.329 --> 15:17.505
You and me, Dmitry,

15:17.540 --> 15:19.349
we get eye for eye.

15:19.384 --> 15:21.457
Starting war is not what Doku would want.

15:21.492 --> 15:24.117
It's what I want!

15:24.757 --> 15:26.817
Look, Doku wanted better for you.

15:26.852 --> 15:29.607
Not for you to roll in slop like pig.

15:35.517 --> 15:38.068
He told me about General.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.499
He did?

15:40.534 --> 15:42.938
He needed my trucks, my border connections

15:42.973 --> 15:46.622
to move this... Arsanov back to Chechnya.

15:47.674 --> 15:51.009
You must convince General I still take him.

15:53.065 --> 15:54.479
Why?

15:54.684 --> 15:57.119
Doku already paid me half.

15:57.154 --> 16:00.032
Other half after I move General.

16:01.332 --> 16:03.382
I want other half.

16:04.904 --> 16:07.405
We get General back to Chechnya.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.480
It's what your brother wanted.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.249
You...

16:14.005 --> 16:15.284
you...

16:16.172 --> 16:19.039
are my brother now, Dmitry.

16:28.582 --> 16:32.216
_

16:36.270 --> 16:40.291
You always come along,
Dmitry, when I need you.

16:40.513 --> 16:44.219
Like when you killed Kost.

16:44.324 --> 16:46.575
And after Doku died.

16:47.817 --> 16:49.698
I feared my brother.

16:49.844 --> 16:52.387
He would hammer me and hammer me,

16:52.551 --> 16:54.669
and it wasn't until after he died

16:54.704 --> 16:57.956
that I realized what he was trying to do.

16:58.091 --> 17:01.893
Harder you hammer the man, tougher he gets.

17:02.060 --> 17:04.777
It was fate, your return.

17:06.075 --> 17:07.823
You killed my brother.

17:07.907 --> 17:10.433
Now you will join him.

18:02.330 --> 18:03.984
Where is Katya?

18:04.659 --> 18:08.361
Wh... Why are you asking?

18:42.203 --> 18:43.576
Tamir.

18:44.344 --> 18:46.067
Tamir, Tamir.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.974
Tamir, tell me where she is.

18:49.066 --> 18:50.762
Where's Kate?

18:51.203 --> 18:53.429
Is she still alive?

18:54.103 --> 18:55.683
Who are you?

18:55.718 --> 18:57.299
Where is she?!

19:30.790 --> 19:32.052
Tamir's dead.

19:32.105 --> 19:33.760
- What?!
- He tried to kill me.

19:33.795 --> 19:37.086
- There was a wreck.
- Jesus.

19:37.268 --> 19:38.425
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.586
Please tell me you got
him to talk before he died.

19:40.635 --> 19:41.831
I got his phone.

19:41.866 --> 19:44.118
It's not the same one
as we bugged yesterday.

19:44.195 --> 19:45.065
A different burner.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.178
If any of Tamir's people call

19:46.213 --> 19:47.658
or text, we can trace it.

19:47.693 --> 19:50.071
That's our play? Sit around with
our thumbs in our asses waiting for

19:50.106 --> 19:51.354
a bloody phone call?

19:51.406 --> 19:53.021
The summit's in two days.

19:53.056 --> 19:55.042
Martin, we have your location.

19:55.098 --> 19:57.264
There's a rest stop about a mile south.

19:57.340 --> 19:59.912
- We'll send a vehicle.
- Send a cleanup team, too.

20:00.002 --> 20:01.390
The plan only works if Tamir's people

20:01.471 --> 20:03.521
thinks he's still alive.

20:04.445 --> 20:06.365
We'll find Kate another way.

20:07.260 --> 20:08.586
Beslan? What about Beslan?

20:08.621 --> 20:09.986
He wasn't with Tamir.

20:10.021 --> 20:12.462
- Do you have eyes on him?
- We don't.

20:12.497 --> 20:14.886
Then pull your thumb out
of your ass and get looking.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.215
All right, checking in?

20:19.422 --> 20:22.228
Yes. One night only.

20:22.263 --> 20:25.011
_

21:04.229 --> 21:06.479
There's a kid called Beslan.

21:06.989 --> 21:08.811
Used to work for Tamir.

21:08.936 --> 21:11.484
He moved Kate out of Paris.

21:11.775 --> 21:13.860
If she was moved again,

21:14.055 --> 21:16.090
he probably helped.

21:18.454 --> 21:19.675
What if we never find her?

21:19.710 --> 21:21.309
We will.

21:22.818 --> 21:24.031
This is my fault.

21:24.066 --> 21:25.976
No.

21:27.178 --> 21:29.368
No, it's mine.

21:29.934 --> 21:31.908
What do you mean?

21:33.681 --> 21:36.434
Tamir told me that Dmitry...

21:36.520 --> 21:39.295
that I killed your husband.

21:40.113 --> 21:42.365
That's why he attacked me.

21:42.471 --> 21:46.866
So I had to kill him before I
could find out where Kate is.

21:53.872 --> 21:56.039
You didn't kill Doku.

22:01.128 --> 22:02.828
I did.

22:08.177 --> 22:10.934
Afterwards, you helped clean it up.

22:16.396 --> 22:18.413
You saved me.

22:45.603 --> 22:46.751
_

22:46.786 --> 22:49.318
How is Ilyana?

22:49.392 --> 22:50.981
Grieving.

22:51.043 --> 22:52.423
Ah.

22:52.558 --> 22:54.892
It won't be easy for her now.

22:58.073 --> 23:02.228
I know my brother made plans
to return you to Chechnya.

23:02.263 --> 23:05.531
And now you are here to tell
me that I should trust you

23:05.566 --> 23:07.045
to carry them out, yes?

23:07.126 --> 23:09.009
Yes, General.

23:11.224 --> 23:14.432
Doku told me much about you.

23:22.443 --> 23:25.829
Do you have another way to get to Chechnya?

23:27.145 --> 23:30.178
Other trucks with compartments to hide in?

23:30.332 --> 23:34.251
Other men with connections at border?

23:39.785 --> 23:41.467
Who is this man?

23:42.138 --> 23:43.782
Dmitry Petrovich.

23:43.843 --> 23:45.726
Russian? I trust no Russian.

23:45.761 --> 23:48.591
Then trust Doku. Doku choose Dmitry.

23:55.429 --> 23:59.978
Tell your Russian dog we move tonight.

24:03.313 --> 24:04.890
Tamir?

24:05.675 --> 24:07.636
There is something else you can do

24:07.671 --> 24:10.661
if you wish to prove your loyalty to me.

24:18.847 --> 24:21.739
Hey, Katya.

24:21.800 --> 24:25.241
Would you like to get ice
cream with your Uncle Tamir?

24:25.535 --> 24:27.210
Let's go.

24:31.863 --> 24:35.592
_

24:42.644 --> 24:44.393
Do you speak English?

24:46.601 --> 24:47.969
Little bit.

24:48.016 --> 24:49.935
I'm Kate.

24:50.116 --> 24:51.904
Katya.

24:52.790 --> 24:53.947
You?

24:55.266 --> 24:56.634
Peet'Mat.

24:57.467 --> 24:59.147
Peet'Mat.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.300
You live here?

25:03.395 --> 25:04.802
Chechnya?

25:05.445 --> 25:06.519
Yes.

25:06.777 --> 25:07.920
My home.

25:11.262 --> 25:13.509
My home is in London.

25:15.374 --> 25:17.524
That's where my family live.

25:18.674 --> 25:21.961
My mum, she worries when I don't call her.

25:22.632 --> 25:25.639
Could you bring me a phone?

25:26.907 --> 25:29.159
- A phone? Can you bring me a phone?
- I'm sorry.

25:29.232 --> 25:30.443
No, no, no, no.

25:30.567 --> 25:33.083
Don't go, please.

25:34.506 --> 25:35.600
Just...

25:35.684 --> 25:37.311
just...

25:38.532 --> 25:40.630
Just call this number.

25:41.502 --> 25:43.822
You don't have to speak with anyone.

25:43.934 --> 25:46.427
Just call it, please.

25:46.462 --> 25:47.950
I won't tell anyone you helped me.

25:48.039 --> 25:49.619
Please.

25:52.224 --> 25:53.688
Please.

25:54.784 --> 25:55.919
Thank you.

25:55.996 --> 25:58.113
Thank you.

26:03.399 --> 26:05.901
_

26:05.970 --> 26:07.427
I just got word from my operative.

26:07.462 --> 26:09.913
The move is still on.

26:10.015 --> 26:11.391
Six want the general separated

26:11.426 --> 26:14.553
from his security detail and terminated.

26:14.588 --> 26:18.849
London will verify the body
and we'll pull out immediately.

26:18.917 --> 26:21.013
Erasing past mistakes, are they?

26:22.336 --> 26:24.704
Selling guns to the
general that were later used

26:24.738 --> 26:27.110
to kill 12 British aid workers.

26:27.145 --> 26:29.042
Quite an embarrassment.

26:29.325 --> 26:31.493
You think we didn't know?

26:31.590 --> 26:33.924
What does Moscow want?

26:35.335 --> 26:36.908
Your man will deliver Arsanov

26:36.943 --> 26:40.073
to new coordinates just
over the Slovakia border.

26:40.156 --> 26:41.568
FSB officers

26:41.603 --> 26:43.368
will take custody.

26:43.704 --> 26:45.891
We have other plans for him.

26:49.666 --> 26:50.943
Blazek is all talk.

26:50.978 --> 26:53.464
He's not going to get you transferred.

26:54.118 --> 26:55.670
But if we're going to catch Dmitry,

26:55.705 --> 26:58.467
we have to play by the rules.

26:59.242 --> 27:01.052
So, go back to your hotel.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.675
Relax.

27:03.653 --> 27:05.069
Okay?

27:21.946 --> 27:23.695
Where's your boss?

27:26.218 --> 27:28.468
No English.

27:31.422 --> 27:33.802
You speak English now?

27:34.024 --> 27:36.825
Where is Dmitry Petrovich?

27:41.522 --> 27:43.482
Have you seen Katya?

27:44.455 --> 27:46.789
Katyusha.

27:48.387 --> 27:50.554
Let me take you to her.

27:54.026 --> 27:55.889
- Curtis.
- I just spoke to one of Dmitry's guys

27:55.924 --> 27:57.447
down at the truck yard.

27:57.523 --> 27:59.511
He says Dmitry came and
went a half an hour ago.

27:59.564 --> 28:02.133
He loaded up a truck in a real hurry.

28:02.168 --> 28:04.186
If Blazek finds out what you've been doing,

28:04.221 --> 28:05.694
forget about getting transferred, Curtis,

28:05.729 --> 28:06.824
- he'll have you arrested.
- Gabi, listen to me.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.048
What was your plan? Were you going to beat

28:08.083 --> 28:09.964
a confession out of him?
He could've killed you.

28:10.032 --> 28:12.116
I saw the manifest for
the truck he drove off in.

28:12.151 --> 28:13.510
You know where's he heading? Slovakia.

28:13.545 --> 28:15.022
He's running, Gabi.

28:15.057 --> 28:16.876
I got the plate number.

28:16.957 --> 28:18.967
And if we find him, then what?

28:19.002 --> 28:20.600
Play Dmitry and Ilyana off each other.

28:20.635 --> 28:21.704
But we're not gonna be able to do that

28:21.739 --> 28:23.978
if he's fled across the border.

28:24.122 --> 28:25.654
What's the plate number?

28:53.591 --> 28:56.986
_

28:58.429 --> 29:00.142
_

29:09.021 --> 29:10.354
What is this?

29:30.374 --> 29:32.355
Katya!

29:32.433 --> 29:34.274
Ilyana, I'm doing this

29:34.341 --> 29:36.511
for your own good and Katya's.

29:37.021 --> 29:39.372
What is going on?! What is going on?!

29:39.529 --> 29:40.804
Huh?!

29:40.906 --> 29:41.804
General Arsanov

29:41.870 --> 29:45.668
invited Ilyana and Katya to
live with him in Chechnya.

29:48.539 --> 29:49.908
She's a widow.

29:50.459 --> 29:52.075
The general is a great man.

29:52.114 --> 29:54.275
Ilyana gonna be his wife.

29:56.829 --> 29:59.640
I agree only to take one.

29:59.748 --> 30:02.360
You will be paid for your trouble.

30:13.273 --> 30:16.496
How am I supposed to
protect cargo without weapon?

30:16.994 --> 30:18.509
If you're worth your price,

30:18.559 --> 30:20.811
we won't need protection, yes?

30:21.674 --> 30:23.758
Put her in the back.

30:30.410 --> 30:31.673
Mama!

30:31.708 --> 30:33.482
Mama's coming with you, Katya.

30:33.517 --> 30:35.350
Don't be scared.

30:47.159 --> 30:49.288
My men will drive.

30:50.088 --> 30:51.778
Allahu Akbar!

30:51.813 --> 30:53.091
Allahu Akbar.

30:53.126 --> 30:54.929
Safe travel.

31:00.546 --> 31:02.461
Good luck, brother.

31:28.676 --> 31:29.829
_

31:31.094 --> 31:32.108

31:39.633 --> 31:43.276

31:48.451 --> 31:50.558

31:50.727 --> 31:52.506

32:01.812 --> 32:03.382

32:03.927 --> 32:06.255

32:06.506 --> 32:08.007

32:08.115 --> 32:10.744

32:17.423 --> 32:18.994

_

33:29.559 --> 33:33.363
_

33:37.674 --> 33:40.936
I know you chose Doku over me, but...

33:41.964 --> 33:44.612
you are not safe without men.

33:46.391 --> 33:48.064
Someone once told me never hesitate

33:48.099 --> 33:50.533
when my family is threatened.

33:52.864 --> 33:56.238
So it's you who needs protection from me.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.820
- Tell me you found him.
- Plate recognition cameras

34:06.901 --> 34:09.303
caught his truck driving
south on Highway 13.

34:09.338 --> 34:11.081
- I'm already headed that way.
- Wait for me, Curtis.

34:11.116 --> 34:14.024
No, he's got a head start. I'll
stop him until you get there.

34:14.081 --> 34:15.716
How will you st...

34:17.967 --> 34:21.697
_

34:25.040 --> 34:27.360

34:28.775 --> 34:31.181

36:45.577 --> 36:47.851
Turn off the engine!

36:55.239 --> 36:56.883
All right, throw me the keys.

36:56.995 --> 36:58.146
Ah, ah.

36:58.181 --> 36:59.881
Here.

37:06.274 --> 37:08.384
Out of the truck, Petrovich.

37:11.550 --> 37:12.755
Okay.

37:21.733 --> 37:24.592
- Turn around.
- Huh?

37:24.635 --> 37:26.229
Turn around!

37:26.298 --> 37:27.821
Hands up.

37:39.583 --> 37:41.207
Stop!

38:05.644 --> 38:07.641
Where are your keys?

38:08.998 --> 38:12.160
I won't let you get
away, you son of a bitch.

38:14.452 --> 38:16.015
God...!

38:19.857 --> 38:21.927
God...!

40:29.731 --> 40:31.606
Hello, Katya.

40:48.681 --> 40:51.434
One of the servants gave me this.

40:52.864 --> 40:55.414
Who were you trying to call?

40:58.233 --> 41:01.582
I understand you are scared.

41:01.699 --> 41:03.075
You want to run away.

41:03.110 --> 41:06.183
But outside these walls, it's not safe.

41:06.285 --> 41:07.885
You are a fugitive.

41:07.949 --> 41:11.117
I want you to feel safe here, with me.

41:13.959 --> 41:16.436
So I have decided to marry you.

41:19.869 --> 41:21.087
But...

41:21.753 --> 41:24.976
I know I'm much older than you, but...

41:25.918 --> 41:27.780
there's no better way to protect you

41:27.815 --> 41:31.621
than to make you the wife
of the president of Chechnya.

41:35.969 --> 41:38.833
It's what your father would want.

41:51.013 --> 41:53.680
You have your mother's eyes.
