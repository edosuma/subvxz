WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:04.801
(grunting, glass breaking)

00:04.803 --> 00:07.036
Officers responding for backup,
arriving at the scene.

00:08.573 --> 00:11.208
All right, all right,
stand down.

00:11.209 --> 00:12.409
We got this covered.

00:12.410 --> 00:14.078
This is why you two boys
called for immediate backup?

00:14.079 --> 00:16.245
Two adorable ladies
having a pillow fight?

00:16.247 --> 00:17.314
OFFICER: Hey, you weren't here.

00:17.315 --> 00:19.283
It was like Ali-Frazier,

00:19.284 --> 00:22.653
if Ali cheated on Frazier
with the UPS girl.

00:22.654 --> 00:24.855
What? These two little peanuts?

00:24.856 --> 00:26.390
Aw. Who won?

00:26.391 --> 00:27.958
Polly Pocket
or Strawberry Shortcake?

00:27.959 --> 00:29.459
You want some, too, bitch?!

00:30.295 --> 00:33.029
Man, control your suspect!

00:33.031 --> 00:35.131
All right, get 'em out of here.
We'll secure the area.

00:35.133 --> 00:37.267
Uh, you sure you two can
handle an empty apartment?

00:37.268 --> 00:39.336
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You heard him, Ramirez.

00:39.337 --> 00:42.004
Housekeeping will
take it from here.

00:43.174 --> 00:44.141
Hey, hey!

00:44.142 --> 00:46.176
Put some mints on the pillow.

00:46.177 --> 00:47.410
(laughing)

00:47.412 --> 00:49.079
You know, I am getting
a little sick

00:49.080 --> 00:51.614
of Seely always acting like
he's better than us. Yeah.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.417
I mean, just 'cause you get
a commendation from the mayor

00:53.418 --> 00:54.685
and back-to-back
marksmanship awards

00:54.686 --> 00:56.220
doesn't mean
you're a better cop.

00:56.221 --> 00:58.721
It kind of does.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.824
(whimpering, growling sound)

01:02.761 --> 01:04.694
Is that your stomach?

01:04.696 --> 01:07.197
I don't know.

01:07.198 --> 01:09.400
(whimpering sound)

01:09.401 --> 01:11.802
Still can't tell.

01:11.803 --> 01:14.070
Shh. I think it's coming
from that closet.

01:19.711 --> 01:21.678
I'll be damned.

01:21.679 --> 01:24.247
I always thought
lesbians were cat people.

01:56.258 --> 02:00.293
Who put this dribble of milk
back in the fridge?

02:00.295 --> 02:01.295
Don't look at me.

02:01.296 --> 02:03.998
I'm off White Russians.

02:03.999 --> 02:07.135
I'm sorry, I can't stand
jug-bottom milk.

02:07.136 --> 02:08.636
Same with the heels
of the bread.

02:08.637 --> 02:10.971
They're nothing
but the ass cheeks of the loaf.

02:12.107 --> 02:14.709
Aw, my baby's got
a picky tummy.

02:14.710 --> 02:15.709
Oh! Joyce, please.

02:15.711 --> 02:18.478
I'm full of milk.

02:20.649 --> 02:23.350
The saddest thing
happened at work today.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.619
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

02:24.620 --> 02:28.088
Would a thimbleful of milk
help you?

02:28.090 --> 02:29.557
Unfortunately, no.

02:29.558 --> 02:31.926
There was a domestic disturbance

02:31.927 --> 02:34.295
and both parties ended up
getting taken into custody,

02:34.296 --> 02:36.931
and the cutest little dog
you have ever seen

02:36.932 --> 02:38.165
got left behind.

02:38.167 --> 02:40.734
Aw. Aw.
I don't like where this is going.

02:42.471 --> 02:44.038
I know how you feel
about dogs, Joyce,

02:44.039 --> 02:46.106
so I took her to the shelter
and left her there.

02:46.108 --> 02:47.240
Poor thing.

02:47.242 --> 02:48.476
Yeah.

02:48.477 --> 02:50.343
(whimpering sound)

02:50.345 --> 02:52.446
That better be your stomach.

02:52.448 --> 02:55.182
Did I mention that this story
has a happy ending?

02:55.184 --> 02:57.217
Oh!
I had to go back

02:57.219 --> 02:58.386
and get her.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.920
Look at that face.

02:59.922 --> 03:01.588
Look at this face. No.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.791
I don't want a dog
in this house.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.194
Come on, it's just
for a couple of days

03:06.195 --> 03:07.561
until her mommies post bail.

03:07.563 --> 03:09.097
And they had
outstanding warrants

03:09.098 --> 03:10.798
for receiving stolen property,
didn't they?

03:10.799 --> 03:12.699
Yes, they did.

03:12.701 --> 03:14.402
Oh, what a sweet
little princess.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.402
Do you know her name?

03:15.404 --> 03:16.404
Birdie.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.105
Oh! Hello, Birdie.

03:18.107 --> 03:19.072
(barks sharply)

03:19.074 --> 03:20.775
Oh. (laughs nervously)

03:20.776 --> 03:22.309
Well, maybe
she doesn't like women.

03:22.311 --> 03:23.910
She has two moms.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.848
Joyce, can we keep the dog,
please?

03:26.849 --> 03:28.448
We'll walk her,
we'll feed her,

03:28.450 --> 03:29.784
and if she craps in the yard,

03:29.785 --> 03:32.285
I'll flick it over the fence
to the neighbor's.

03:32.287 --> 03:33.621
Hey, she won't be any trouble.

03:33.622 --> 03:34.622
I promise.

03:34.623 --> 03:35.722
Pretty please...

03:35.724 --> 03:37.158
Oh, all right.

03:37.159 --> 03:39.227
But I don't want to see it,
I don't want to smell it,

03:39.228 --> 03:40.595
and keep her off
of the furniture.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.529
Same deal I had when
she brought you home.

03:43.966 --> 03:45.332
I'll make her up a little bed.

03:45.334 --> 03:46.667
Uh, I got one out in the car.

03:46.668 --> 03:48.568
Come on.

03:48.570 --> 03:49.971
You know what I think?

03:49.972 --> 03:51.438
I think you and I
are gonna be best pals.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.374
Best pals, I can tell already.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.409
You want to go in the kitchen
with me and get some bacon?

03:55.410 --> 03:56.610
Huh?

03:57.946 --> 04:00.080
Let's go into the kitchen
and get some bacon. (gasps)

04:00.082 --> 04:01.281
(baby talk)

04:01.283 --> 04:02.316
Well, that's the kitchen.

04:02.317 --> 04:03.317
You don't know,

04:03.318 --> 04:04.451
but I'm gonna go get you
some bacon.

04:04.453 --> 04:05.820
Okay, Mom, keep an eye on her.

04:05.821 --> 04:07.321
I'm gonna get her some bacon.

04:07.322 --> 04:09.156
She's a little standoffish.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.096
My wine.

04:15.097 --> 04:16.630
<i>My</i> wine!

04:16.632 --> 04:17.831
No...

04:28.377 --> 04:29.610
Oh!

04:29.611 --> 04:30.611
Mike...

04:30.612 --> 04:31.646
What? What happened?

04:31.647 --> 04:32.980
Are you okay, girl?

04:32.981 --> 04:35.016
Your "girl" just kicked me
out of bed.

04:35.017 --> 04:36.516
What is she doing in here?

04:36.518 --> 04:38.486
Oh, I went down to check
on her in her crate,

04:38.487 --> 04:40.221
and I couldn't stand
to see the poor thing

04:40.222 --> 04:42.189
locked up behind bars.

04:42.191 --> 04:44.891
You're a cop, you lock
people up every day.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.160
Yeah, people.

04:46.161 --> 04:49.829
Not pretty girls who like
their bellies rubbed.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.033
If she's gonna stay,
then she's got to move over.

04:52.034 --> 04:52.933
Come on.

04:52.935 --> 04:56.002
Come on, ro... move over.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.872
Come on.

04:57.873 --> 05:00.040
Come...

05:00.042 --> 05:02.243
Come on...

05:02.244 --> 05:04.711
come on...

05:04.713 --> 05:05.813
Seriously?

05:05.814 --> 05:06.814
All right, how about, uh,

05:06.815 --> 05:08.082
I sleep in the middle

05:08.083 --> 05:10.684
and I'll spoon her
and then you spoon me.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.153
All right.

05:12.154 --> 05:14.588
Obviously, she wants
some alone time with you.

05:14.590 --> 05:17.891
Never thought I'd lose you
to somebody named Birdie.

05:17.893 --> 05:20.093
Just for the weekend.

05:21.263 --> 05:23.497
Oh, boy,
somebody has awful breath.

05:23.498 --> 05:27.067
Don't worry. Tomorrow,
you can use my toothbrush.

05:33.642 --> 05:35.009
Oh, look at this one.

05:35.010 --> 05:36.277
She's just sitting on the floor.

05:36.278 --> 05:37.244
Just sitting there.

05:37.246 --> 05:40.114
On the floor.

05:40.115 --> 05:41.281
Isn't that cute?

05:41.283 --> 05:42.984
It's adorable.

05:42.985 --> 05:45.019
Just like the last ten pictures
you showed me,

05:45.020 --> 05:47.520
and the two-minute video of her
drinking out of the toilet.

05:47.522 --> 05:51.225
She opened the lid
and everything, by herself.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.526
This dog is smart, Carl.

05:52.527 --> 05:54.728
Scary smart.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.097
You know, for something
that you got to return

05:56.098 --> 05:57.331
in a couple of days,
don't you think

05:57.332 --> 05:59.200
you might be getting
a little too attached to it?

05:59.201 --> 06:00.134
Okay, first of all,

06:00.135 --> 06:01.569
that "something" has a name.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.569
Birdie.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.903
And yes,

06:03.905 --> 06:05.506
I have fallen hard for her.

06:05.507 --> 06:08.708
So, please, let me just enjoy
what little time we have left.

06:08.710 --> 06:09.844
All right.

06:09.845 --> 06:11.245
I know better
than to get between a man

06:11.246 --> 06:12.612
and someone else's dog.

06:12.614 --> 06:14.882
You know, when Molly and me
finally move into our own place,

06:14.883 --> 06:17.017
the first thing I'm gonna do?
Buy a puppy.

06:17.019 --> 06:18.585
Yeah, well, hopefully
that one won't hate Molly.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.688
I don't know what that is.

06:20.689 --> 06:22.156
Birdie loves everyone.

06:22.157 --> 06:25.592
Even Joyce, who growls every time
the poor pooch walks by.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.495
Well, you know,
dogs are very intuitive.

06:27.496 --> 06:29.063
You know? They can
sense things we can't

06:29.064 --> 06:31.731
and know things about
people... we don't.

06:34.569 --> 06:36.203
What are you trying to say, Carl?
I'm just saying,

06:36.204 --> 06:38.805
how much do we really
know about this Molly?

06:38.807 --> 06:40.908
The only thing she hides
from me are Visa bills.

06:40.909 --> 06:44.110
Unless Birdie can sniff out
bad credit, you're crazy.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.913
All right.
But Birdie's onto something.

06:45.914 --> 06:47.548
You might have married yourself
a cat person.

06:47.549 --> 06:50.317
Don't you dare say that!

06:50.319 --> 06:51.685
What's wrong with a cat?

06:51.687 --> 06:53.521
They're jerks.
And they don't care who knows it.

06:53.522 --> 06:55.856
Because they're jerks.

06:55.857 --> 06:57.425
Yeah, but see,
that's why I like 'em.

06:57.426 --> 06:59.093
You know?
Make you earn their love.

06:59.094 --> 07:01.062
Might have something
to do with my low self-esteem,

07:01.063 --> 07:03.863
but I do enjoy
a standoffish kitty.

07:03.865 --> 07:05.666
As long as she's not
a bird person.

07:05.667 --> 07:08.768
Now, those people, they're just weird.
Mmm.

07:08.770 --> 07:10.638
Look at this one.

07:10.639 --> 07:11.839
(chuckles)

07:11.840 --> 07:15.008
Oh, no, that's Vince's head.

07:18.013 --> 07:20.381
I can't believe the sweater fit.

07:20.382 --> 07:21.481
I told you.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.584
Made that when you were
just six months old.

07:23.585 --> 07:25.285
You outgrew it in a week.

07:26.455 --> 07:27.455
Look at her.

07:27.456 --> 07:29.189
Look at the boss.

07:29.191 --> 07:30.958
You are just a lovebug.

07:30.959 --> 07:33.427
You're gonna have to come spend
a weekend at Grandma's,

07:33.428 --> 07:35.362
so I can spoil you rotten.

07:35.364 --> 07:36.564
Well, don't get too attached.

07:36.565 --> 07:38.366
Remember, I gotta take her back
in a couple days.

07:38.367 --> 07:40.000
Oh...
Can we not talk about Birdie leaving, please?

07:40.001 --> 07:42.502
You're getting her
all worked up.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.705
Mike, look what Birdie
did to my shoe.

07:44.706 --> 07:45.705
MIKE: Oh, no.

07:45.707 --> 07:46.941
Did she eat some leather?

07:46.942 --> 07:48.842
Are you okay, girl?

07:49.911 --> 07:52.246
Oh, I'll grab her some charcoal.

07:52.247 --> 07:54.048
We'll-we'll get her to throw up.

07:54.049 --> 07:57.150
Wait, what are we going
to do about this?

07:57.152 --> 07:58.986
Well, maybe not leave
your clodhoppers laying around.

07:58.987 --> 08:02.389
Poor baby could have choked
on that ugly shoe.

08:03.725 --> 08:05.493
We should puppy-proof
the whole house.

08:05.494 --> 08:07.327
Any mistake she makes
is really our fault.

08:07.329 --> 08:09.662
Or maybe we could
leave her in the crate

08:09.664 --> 08:11.297
while we're not watching her,
like we talked about.

08:11.299 --> 08:13.533
You can't put her in a crate.
That's cruel.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.069
It's not cruel.
It's a dog crate.

08:15.070 --> 08:18.271
It's a crate specifically made
to put a dog into.

08:18.273 --> 08:21.409
People also put dogs in sacks
and toss them in the river.

08:21.410 --> 08:23.176
Should we do that, too?
Oh, my God!

08:23.178 --> 08:25.079
I'm not saying kill the dog.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.179
Mike, back me up here.

08:26.181 --> 08:28.415
Ma, I won't let her
kill the dog.

08:28.417 --> 08:29.549
I... no!

08:29.551 --> 08:31.552
I have never said kill the dog!

08:31.553 --> 08:32.986
I'm just trying
to keep this mutt

08:32.988 --> 08:34.988
from chewing her way
through my entire closet.

08:34.990 --> 08:37.657
(barks) You stay out of this.

08:37.659 --> 08:42.028
Just asking, if this was a cat,
would you feel differently?

08:42.030 --> 08:43.863
What?

08:43.865 --> 08:47.000
I'm gonna take her outside
until this one stops screaming.

08:47.002 --> 08:48.536
I'm not scr...!

08:48.537 --> 08:50.470
(whispering):
I am not screaming.

08:50.472 --> 08:52.406
Boy, treat a poor dog like this,

08:52.407 --> 08:54.607
I guess we can see
what kind of mother you'd be.

08:58.013 --> 08:59.480
She's not allowed
back in the house

08:59.481 --> 09:01.014
until she learns how to behave.

09:01.016 --> 09:01.948
The dog?

09:01.950 --> 09:03.149
Her, too.

09:08.523 --> 09:10.824
Well, Birdie's in her crate.

09:11.626 --> 09:14.894
Her cold, dark crate.

09:14.896 --> 09:16.230
Mike, she's gonna be fine.

09:16.231 --> 09:17.998
She's got a heating pad
and a blanket,

09:17.999 --> 09:20.534
plus Vince is sleeping next
to her on the kitchen floor.

09:20.535 --> 09:23.837
I know, it's just gonna be weird
to be in this bed all alone.

09:23.839 --> 09:26.272
I'm right here.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.675
You know what I mean.

09:27.676 --> 09:29.510
Fine, I'll try to snore.

09:29.511 --> 09:30.945
You can scratch my tummy.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.079
Try to snore?

09:33.081 --> 09:35.883
You know that just because
I'm putting her in a crate

09:35.884 --> 09:38.852
doesn't mean somehow, you know,
I'm gonna be a bad mother.

09:38.854 --> 09:40.653
Nobody's saying that.

09:40.655 --> 09:42.456
Your mother said exactly that.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.591
And she's got some nerve

09:43.592 --> 09:45.325
after all the stuff
she did to you.

09:45.327 --> 09:46.993
Hey, she's a good mom.

09:46.995 --> 09:48.562
Mike.

09:48.563 --> 09:50.397
It's me.

09:50.398 --> 09:52.032
When you were a baby,

09:52.033 --> 09:54.767
your car seat
was a laundry basket.

09:55.871 --> 09:57.071
It was safe.

09:57.072 --> 09:59.506
She wedged me in with towels.

10:00.342 --> 10:02.308
I rest my case.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.011
Oh, all right, well,
how about your mom?

10:04.012 --> 10:05.278
She's not exactly perfect.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.614
I didn't say she was perfect,

10:06.615 --> 10:09.816
but I think she did
a pretty darn good job.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.785
Molly, come on.

10:11.786 --> 10:13.287
It's me.

10:13.288 --> 10:15.655
She soaked your teething rag
in whiskey.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.158
And I never felt
a single tooth come in,

10:18.159 --> 10:20.227
plus I was sleeping
through the night at six weeks.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.462
Yeah, 'cause she didn't want
to deal with you.

10:22.464 --> 10:24.598
Well, better to be ignored
than smothered.

10:24.599 --> 10:26.000
What are you talking about?

10:26.001 --> 10:27.902
Your mom can't stand
to be away from you.

10:27.903 --> 10:30.937
She wanted to go with us
on our honeymoon.

10:30.939 --> 10:33.473
She had never been to Paris.

10:33.475 --> 10:36.577
Well, maybe you should take her
for our anniversary.

10:36.578 --> 10:37.710
You know what,

10:37.712 --> 10:39.713
I think Birdie
might be right about you.

10:39.714 --> 10:41.282
You're not very nice.

10:41.283 --> 10:42.482
Where you going?

10:42.484 --> 10:44.651
I'm gonna go snuggle
with my best gal.

10:44.653 --> 10:46.553
Oh, I thought your mom
already left.

10:46.555 --> 10:48.354
(blows raspberry)

10:58.337 --> 11:00.405
(Birdie barking) I've been
nothing but nice to you!

11:00.406 --> 11:02.073
I'm telling Mom you were
on the couch.

11:02.074 --> 11:03.641
Oh, leave her.

11:03.642 --> 11:05.176
She's sweet.

11:05.177 --> 11:07.045
When did you turn?

11:07.046 --> 11:09.347
When I realized she looks
exactly like Vince.

11:09.348 --> 11:11.015
That's who it is.

11:11.016 --> 11:13.617
They got the same underbite
and everything.

11:13.619 --> 11:16.254
All I know is, I don't care
if a dog likes me,

11:16.255 --> 11:18.356
because I like me.

11:18.357 --> 11:19.790
Well, I like you, too.

11:19.792 --> 11:22.493
But why doesn't
that dog like me?

11:22.495 --> 11:24.629
Why are you letting this
get to you?

11:24.630 --> 11:27.265
Because it's like when you pick
up a baby and it starts crying.

11:27.266 --> 11:28.600
It makes you start thinking

11:28.601 --> 11:30.201
there's something wrong
with you.

11:30.202 --> 11:31.536
Ugh. I know what you mean.

11:31.537 --> 11:33.671
You two cried
all the time when I held you.

11:33.672 --> 11:35.140
At first, I thought it was me.

11:35.141 --> 11:36.775
Then I realized
it was the cigarette smoke.

11:36.776 --> 11:39.143
You smoked around us?

11:39.145 --> 11:41.445
Not after that.
I just held you less.

11:42.782 --> 11:44.816
God, you were needy babies.

11:44.817 --> 11:47.519
Isn't that the deal with babies?

11:47.520 --> 11:49.353
They kind of need stuff from ya?

11:49.355 --> 11:51.389
Oh, yeah.
They're a real pain in the ass.

11:51.390 --> 11:53.457
But that's the job.

11:53.459 --> 11:56.193
You know, keep the kids alive
till they become interesting.

11:57.630 --> 12:00.432
Why did you even have us?

12:00.433 --> 12:02.267
It's what people did back then.

12:02.268 --> 12:03.868
You know,
like feathering your hair

12:03.869 --> 12:06.236
or littering on the expressway.

12:07.506 --> 12:09.541
Important thing is,
I love you now.

12:09.542 --> 12:12.110
Should we believe her?

12:12.111 --> 12:14.511
What choice do we have?

12:22.154 --> 12:24.321
Kraft Singles
and a jar of applesauce?

12:24.323 --> 12:26.925
That is the saddest lunch
I've ever seen.

12:26.926 --> 12:29.494
Yeah, Birdie ate my first lunch
off the counter.

12:29.495 --> 12:30.829
It was so cute,

12:30.830 --> 12:33.964
but she's gonna have trouble
passing that sandwich bag.

12:33.966 --> 12:36.234
So, now, are you gonna dip
the cheese in the applesauce

12:36.235 --> 12:38.336
or roll the applesauce
in the cheese like a burrito?

12:38.337 --> 12:39.771
You sound interested.

12:39.772 --> 12:41.339
You want to trade
for half your lunch?

12:41.340 --> 12:43.241
Sure. I got quinoa salad
with tuna.

12:43.242 --> 12:45.008
I'm good.

12:46.145 --> 12:47.979
Mikey!
Hey!

12:47.980 --> 12:49.514
Ma, what are you doing here?

12:49.515 --> 12:51.716
I was across the street
at the Sam's Club.

12:51.717 --> 12:53.151
You bent over the other night,

12:53.152 --> 12:55.320
and I saw
you might need new briefs.

12:55.321 --> 12:57.288
Ma, you didn't
have to do that...

12:57.289 --> 12:59.791
here at work.

12:59.792 --> 13:02.160
Of course I did.
I wanted to make sure they fit.

13:02.161 --> 13:03.928
Hey, Ma, while you're here,
not for nothing,

13:03.929 --> 13:05.763
but next time
you're over at the house,

13:05.764 --> 13:07.866
try not to say horrible things
to my wife.

13:07.867 --> 13:09.133
What are you talking about?

13:09.134 --> 13:11.469
That shot you made about
what kind of mother she'd be.

13:11.470 --> 13:13.605
She knew what I meant.
What'd you mean?

13:13.606 --> 13:15.305
That she'd be a horrible mother.

13:16.575 --> 13:18.275
I don't know how
she'd take that wrong.

13:18.277 --> 13:20.745
Look, Molly's gonna make
a great mom.

13:20.746 --> 13:23.648
It's not her fault that she hasn't
had the best example.

13:23.649 --> 13:24.949
That's true.

13:24.950 --> 13:27.285
They don't have the kind
of relationship that we have.

13:27.286 --> 13:29.120
Right. Ah, darn it.

13:29.121 --> 13:31.022
Ooh, here, give me that.

13:31.023 --> 13:33.257
You're making a mess. Ugh.

13:33.259 --> 13:35.660
I guess I'm just gonna
have to step up

13:35.661 --> 13:38.663
and try to be more
of a role model for her.

13:38.664 --> 13:40.198
Yeah, show her what a healthy,

13:40.199 --> 13:42.699
mother-child
relationship should be.

13:47.706 --> 13:50.107
I wouldn't show that to anyone.

13:50.109 --> 13:52.510
Wait, wait.
Do the airplane.

13:52.511 --> 13:55.012
(imitates airplane
engine revving)

14:00.119 --> 14:02.220
Okay, let's go over this
one more time.

14:02.221 --> 14:04.255
When I say "Joyce," you do what?

14:04.256 --> 14:06.257
Joyce!

14:06.258 --> 14:07.425
Good girl.

14:07.426 --> 14:09.127
And when I say,
"Good-bye, honey!"

14:09.128 --> 14:10.562
Ah, good girl!

14:10.563 --> 14:13.665
Mike was right... you are smart.

14:13.666 --> 14:14.932
(sighs)

14:14.934 --> 14:18.102
Hey. Hi.
I'm glad you're both here.

14:18.103 --> 14:20.071
I got some bad news.

14:20.072 --> 14:22.073
Birdie's moms
made bail this morning.

14:22.074 --> 14:23.607
They want her back tonight.

14:23.609 --> 14:25.877
Oh. There's nothing
you could do?

14:25.878 --> 14:27.645
You're a cop.
You're above the law.

14:27.646 --> 14:29.280
Plant something on 'em.

14:29.281 --> 14:32.149
It's already done. Look, we knew
this day was gonna come.

14:32.151 --> 14:33.818
We could say the dog ran away.

14:33.819 --> 14:35.954
I'll take her, lay low
till things cool off.

14:35.955 --> 14:37.622
You get a dog
that looks just like Birdie,

14:37.623 --> 14:39.390
run her over with
your car a few times...

14:39.391 --> 14:41.458
Vince!

14:41.460 --> 14:43.428
I'm sorry!
I'm spinning out here!

14:43.429 --> 14:45.563
What's going on?

14:45.564 --> 14:47.098
We got to take the dog back.

14:47.099 --> 14:49.133
I'm sorry.
Are you?

14:49.134 --> 14:50.702
Yes!
Are you?!

14:50.703 --> 14:52.470
Yes!
All right!

14:52.471 --> 14:54.439
We're all a little raw
right now.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.708
Vince, grab her stuff,
and I'll meet you in the car.

14:56.709 --> 14:58.977
I can't do it.
It's too painful.

14:58.978 --> 15:01.678
Well, I can't do it either.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.647
(scoffs) Give me the leash.

15:03.649 --> 15:06.249
Wa-Wa-Wait. What-what are
you gonna do to her?

15:06.251 --> 15:08.219
She already hates me.
I'll do it.

15:08.220 --> 15:10.688
She'll probably be happy
to get away from me.

15:10.689 --> 15:13.558
Thank you.

15:13.559 --> 15:15.526
Okay, well, I guess this is it.

15:15.527 --> 15:17.562
You-you got to go home now.

15:17.563 --> 15:19.130
We can't keep you anymore.

15:19.131 --> 15:21.165
I'm... Oh, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.333
Oh, cut it out!

15:22.334 --> 15:24.068
You're making this harder
than it is.

15:24.069 --> 15:25.570
Now-now go on!

15:25.571 --> 15:26.871
Go on, you big dummy.

15:26.872 --> 15:28.872
Go home!

15:28.874 --> 15:31.675
I should go check on him.
He's a mess.

15:34.513 --> 15:38.215
Boy, you got those two wrapped
around your fat little paw.

15:44.690 --> 15:47.558
Look, I don't know
what your problem is with me,

15:47.559 --> 15:51.562
but whatever vibe you think
you're picking up, you're wrong.

15:51.563 --> 15:53.531
(laughs)

15:53.532 --> 15:55.732
I'm a nice person.

15:55.734 --> 15:58.035
Just because we didn't connect,
you know,

15:58.037 --> 16:01.439
doesn't mean
that I'm unloving or-or cold.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.106
I mean, maybe it's you.

16:03.108 --> 16:08.245
Maybe-maybe this is something
that <i> you've</i> got to work through.

16:10.516 --> 16:14.052
I mean, we all, you know,
have to work through some stuff.

16:14.053 --> 16:17.055
I mean,
judgmental mother-in-law or

16:17.056 --> 16:18.823
not-good-as-you-thought mothers.

16:18.824 --> 16:22.827
But, I mean, thinking
that I'm not gonna be a good mother

16:22.828 --> 16:24.962
because a dog doesn't like me?

16:24.963 --> 16:26.830
Please.

16:28.233 --> 16:30.567
It doesn't bother me at all.

16:30.569 --> 16:32.670
(horn honking,
tires squealing) Ooh!

16:32.671 --> 16:35.006
Watch it, jackass!

16:35.007 --> 16:36.606
You all right? Huh?

16:36.608 --> 16:39.911
(laughing):
Oh! Are you giving me kisses?

16:39.912 --> 16:42.212
Are you giving me kisses?

16:42.214 --> 16:45.283
Yes, you are.
I knew you liked me.

16:45.284 --> 16:46.550
Oh!

16:46.552 --> 16:48.152
(laughing): Oh!

16:48.153 --> 16:49.420
No! That's a...

16:49.421 --> 16:50.655
I'm not gonna tell Mike.

16:50.656 --> 16:53.291
I'm not gonna tell Mike that.
Oh.

16:53.292 --> 16:56.861
I'm gonna be an amazing mother.

16:56.862 --> 17:01.421
Oh. I knew it.
I knew it.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.258
I'm telling you, Mike,

17:13.259 --> 17:17.396
it broke my heart giving Birdie
back to her owners, but

17:17.396 --> 17:20.165
in the end, I think
she might have loved me

17:20.165 --> 17:23.335
even a little bit more
than she loved you.

17:23.336 --> 17:25.002
Of course she did.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.304
Everybody does.

17:26.306 --> 17:27.673
Yeah, except your mother.

17:27.674 --> 17:29.575
Ah, don't listen to her.
She's nuts.

17:29.576 --> 17:31.510
Mine preferred Virginia
Slims over babies.

17:31.511 --> 17:34.313
(laughs)

17:34.314 --> 17:35.614
They mean well.

17:35.615 --> 17:37.750
Do they?

17:37.751 --> 17:40.152
I can't tell anymore.

17:40.153 --> 17:43.021
Do you think our own kids
are gonna think we're crazy?

17:43.022 --> 17:46.124
If we do our jobs right.

17:46.926 --> 17:49.160
(toy squeaks) Oh!

17:50.230 --> 17:52.130
Oh.
(toy squeaks)

17:52.132 --> 17:53.698
I miss Birdie.

17:54.501 --> 17:57.499
She'll be fine.
