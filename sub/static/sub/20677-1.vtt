00:30.363 --> 00:32.331
I'm out in the prime cut
of the big green.

00:32.432 --> 00:37.062
Behind me is Ed and Rowdy, members
of an up-and-coming subadult gang.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.469
They're challenging everything, including me.
Goes with the territory.

00:40.573 --> 00:44.407
If I show weakness,
if I retreat,

00:44.511 --> 00:46.706
I may be hurt,
I may be killed.

00:46.813 --> 00:50.214
I must hold my own
if I'm gonna stay within this land.

00:50.316 --> 00:52.978
For once there is weakness,
they will exploit it, they will take me out,

00:53.086 --> 00:56.852
they will decapitate me,
they will chop me into bits and pieces.

00:56.956 --> 00:58.924
I'm dead.

00:59.025 --> 01:03.086
But so far, I persevere.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.629
Persevere.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.630
Most times
I'm a kind warrior out here.

01:09.736 --> 01:13.536
Most times, I am gentle,
I am like a flower,

01:13.640 --> 01:17.269
I'm like... I'm like
a fly on the wall,

01:17.377 --> 01:21.473
observing, noncommittal,
noninvasive in any way.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.243
Occasionally I am challenged.
And in that case,

01:24.350 --> 01:27.547
the kind warrior must,
must, must become a samurai.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.679
Must become so,

01:30.757 --> 01:32.782
so formidable,

01:33.993 --> 01:36.461
so fearless of death,

01:36.563 --> 01:37.996
so strong

01:39.132 --> 01:41.794
that he will win, he will win.

01:41.901 --> 01:45.632
Even the bears will believe
that you are more powerful.

01:45.738 --> 01:49.139
And in a sense
you must be more powerful

01:49.242 --> 01:53.372
if you are to survive in this land
with the bear.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.916
No one knew that.
No one ever friggin' knew

01:57.016 --> 02:01.214
that there are times when my life
is on the precipice of death

02:01.321 --> 02:04.552
and that these bears can bite,
they can kill.

02:04.657 --> 02:07.091
And if I am weak,
I go down.

02:07.193 --> 02:09.127
I love them with all my heart.
I will protect them.

02:09.229 --> 02:13.757
I will die for them, but I will not die
at their claws and paws.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.359
I will fight. I will be strong.
I'll be one of them.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.268
I will be... the master.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.374
But still a kind warrior.

02:33.353 --> 02:34.911
Love you, Rowdy.

02:35.021 --> 02:37.512
Give it to me, baby.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.649
That's what I'm talkin' about.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.624
That's what I'm talkin' about.

02:44.397 --> 02:48.163
I can smell death
all over my fingers.

03:12.091 --> 03:16.858
<i>All these majestic creatures were filmed</i>
<i>by Timothy Treadwell</i>

03:16.963 --> 03:21.332
<i>who lived among wild grizzlies</i>
<i>for 13 summers</i>.

03:23.469 --> 03:27.064
<i>He went to remote areas</i>
<i>of the Alaskan peninsula</i>

03:27.173 --> 03:29.437
<i>believing that</i>
<i>he was needed there</i>

03:29.542 --> 03:34.309
<i>to protect these animals</i>
<i>and educate the public</i>.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.406
<i>During his last five years</i>
<i>out there,</i>

03:37.517 --> 03:39.542
<i>he took along a video camera</i>

03:39.652 --> 03:43.679
<i>and shot over 100 hours</i>
<i>of footage</i>.

03:43.790 --> 03:49.057
<i>What Treadwell intended was to show</i>
<i>these bears in their natural habitat</i>.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.689
<i>Having myself filmed</i>
<i>in the wilderness of jungles,</i>

03:54.801 --> 03:57.565
<i>I found that beyond</i>
<i>the wildlife film,</i>

03:57.670 --> 04:00.332
<i>in his material lay</i>
<i>dormant a story</i>

04:00.440 --> 04:03.068
<i>of astonishing beauty</i>
<i>and depth</i>.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.405
<i>I discovered a film</i>
<i>of human ecstasies</i>

04:08.514 --> 04:11.449
<i>and darkest inner turmoil</i>.

04:12.518 --> 04:14.748
<i>As if there was</i>
<i>a desire in him</i>

04:14.854 --> 04:18.119
<i>to leave the confinements</i>
<i>of his humanness</i>

04:18.224 --> 04:20.158
<i>and bond with the bears,</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:25.197
<i>Treadwell reached out,</i>
<i>seeking a primordial encounter</i>.

04:25.298 --> 04:30.031
<i>But in doing so, he crossed</i>
<i>an invisible borderline</i>.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.809
Go back and play.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.488
Go ahead back. Go back.

05:00.566 --> 05:01.692
Go back.

05:03.536 --> 05:06.437
This is a subadult.
And this is what happens to them.

05:06.539 --> 05:09.906
They work together,
and they get really powerful.

05:10.009 --> 05:12.842
As you can see,
I'm just feet away.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.778
You just relax.
You just relax.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.651
He's now moving away from me.

05:20.753 --> 05:25.918
I've now proven myself as being able to hold
my ground and therefore earning their respect.

05:26.025 --> 05:29.222
This is Rowdy, the bear.
And he's rowdy.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.297
He's gettin' bigger.

05:32.732 --> 05:36.668
Knew him from... He was a little dot
a couple of years ago.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.499
He's gettin' to be a big boy.
Anyway, we're doing just fine.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.467
But that was a challenge,

05:42.575 --> 05:45.510
and you have to remain cool
in the challenge, in the moment.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.476
If you don't, you're dead.

05:47.580 --> 05:51.676
They can kill. They can bite.
They can decapitate.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.906
Excuse me. Hey.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.711
Hey!

06:25.818 --> 06:28.946
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.922
I didn't mean to get in your way.

06:32.024 --> 06:35.357
Wow. It's okay.
You're the boss.

06:35.461 --> 06:39.795
Nice job. Wow! Nice job.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.795
I gotta think, he was over ten-feet high,
don't you?

06:42.902 --> 06:45.735
He's a big bear!
He's a big bear!

06:45.838 --> 06:48.136
A very big bear! Wow!

06:49.175 --> 06:52.303
Anyway, he's over here
rub-a-dub-dubbing.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.039
He's a big bear!

06:54.147 --> 06:56.809
<i>The excitement Treadwell felt</i>

06:56.916 --> 06:59.817
<i>connected him immediately</i>
<i>with children</i>.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.479
<i>In his campaign</i>
<i>to create awareness,</i>

07:02.588 --> 07:05.318
<i>he reached thousands and thousands</i>
<i>of school children</i>

07:05.425 --> 07:07.985
<i>who would remember</i>
<i>his fabulous storytelling</i>

07:08.094 --> 07:12.087
<i>as one of the highlights</i>
<i>of their school years</i>.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.689
<i>He took his mission</i>
<i>so seriously</i>

07:14.801 --> 07:17.668
<i>that he never solicited for a fee</i>.

07:19.539 --> 07:23.737
<i>Over time, he reached the status</i>
<i>of a national celebrity</i>.

07:25.077 --> 07:28.342
<i>Timothy Treadwell is crazy</i>
<i>about grizzly bears</i>.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.348
<i>How crazy? Sometimes</i>...

07:30.450 --> 07:32.918
<i>It was as if he had become a star</i>

07:33.019 --> 07:35.487
<i>by virtue of his own invention</i>.

07:35.588 --> 07:39.684
I would be within
the physical presence of bears

07:39.792 --> 07:42.886
24 hours a day
for months at a time.

07:42.995 --> 07:46.431
This is... cra <i>z</i> y.
This is nuts.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.023
These are the most dangerous animals
on the face of the earth.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.228
- Well...
- And you want to go

07:51.337 --> 07:53.703
and put yourself in harm's way
24 hours a day?

07:53.806 --> 07:55.501
I think they've been misunderstood.

07:55.608 --> 07:59.476
<i>How can I believe that if you are</i>
<i>about to be killed by a bear,</i>

07:59.579 --> 08:03.709
that you wouldn't say, "I made a mistake.
I'd like to have a gun"?

08:03.816 --> 08:06.683
I would never, ever kill a bear
in defense of my own life.

08:06.786 --> 08:09.880
Would not go into a bear's home
and kill a bear.

08:14.093 --> 08:16.823
One day, I came home

08:16.929 --> 08:20.296
and I was sitting on my patio.

08:20.399 --> 08:23.493
My wife was in the bedroom
with the TV on.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.629
And I heard her scream.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.441
And I thought
she'd fallen or something.

08:31.544 --> 08:34.570
I came in and she was sitting
on the edge of the bed,

08:34.679 --> 08:36.841
staring at the television.

08:36.948 --> 08:39.417
I looked at the television,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.611
and I saw Timmy's face.

08:41.721 --> 08:44.519
I hadn't heard the sound
or the news yet,

08:44.624 --> 08:47.593
but I knew just by seeing
Timmy's face on TV

08:47.693 --> 08:50.287
and hearing
my wife's reaction,

08:50.396 --> 08:52.921
that the worst had happened.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.830
Not necessarily a surprise,

08:57.003 --> 09:00.131
but... the worst.

09:01.641 --> 09:04.633
<i>I never have days</i>
<i>when I grieve for Timmy</i>

09:04.744 --> 09:08.145
<i>as I have with other friends</i>
<i>who have died</i>.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.442
<i>They feel dead</i>.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.040
<i>Timmy doesn't feel dead</i>.

09:15.254 --> 09:18.985
<i>This is the last photo</i>
<i>of Timothy Treadwell</i>.

09:19.091 --> 09:22.185
<i>It was taken at the beginning</i>
<i>of his 13th summer</i>

09:22.295 --> 09:24.729
<i>in the wilds of Alaska</i>.

09:24.830 --> 09:29.767
<i>With him is Amie Huguenard,</i>
<i>who would die by his side</i>.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.237
<i>The man who took the photo</i>
<i>was Willy Fulton,</i>

09:34.340 --> 09:36.137
<i>a close friend of Timothy's,</i>

09:36.242 --> 09:39.268
<i>and the pilot</i>
<i>who would bring him to this remote part</i>

09:39.378 --> 09:41.676
<i>of the Alaskan peninsula</i>.

09:43.816 --> 09:47.217
<i>Treadwell saw himself</i>
<i>as the guardian of this land</i>

09:47.320 --> 09:50.312
<i>and stylized himself</i>
<i>as Prince Valiant,</i>

09:50.423 --> 09:55.383
<i>fighting the bad guys with their schemes</i>
<i>to do harm to the bears</i>.

09:55.494 --> 09:59.453
<i>But all this land is</i>
<i>a federally protected reserve,</i>

09:59.565 --> 10:02.193
<i>part of Katmai National Park</i>.

10:12.878 --> 10:16.279
<i>This big plain,</i>
<i>Treadwell called "The Sanctuary."</i>

10:16.382 --> 10:18.873
<i>Here he would spend</i>
<i>the early summer months</i>

10:18.985 --> 10:21.419
<i>before moving along</i>
<i>some 35 miles</i>

10:21.520 --> 10:23.920
<i>to this densely overgrown area</i>

10:24.023 --> 10:25.923
<i>which he called</i>
<i>"The Grizzly Maze"</i>

10:26.025 --> 10:29.461
<i>where he would observe</i>
<i>the late summer salmon run</i>.

10:31.998 --> 10:36.025
<i>It was here that Fulton</i>
<i>would pick him up in the fall</i>.

10:38.104 --> 10:41.540
<i>On October 6 last year,</i>
<i>this is the spot here at Kaflia Lake</i>

10:41.641 --> 10:44.337
<i>where I pulled in</i>
<i>to pick up Tim and Amie</i>.

10:45.678 --> 10:49.614
<i>Typical day out here</i>.
<i>Rain, foggy, a lot of wind</i>.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.941
<i>It was kinda strange</i>.
<i>Didn't see him, didn't hear anything</i>.

10:54.053 --> 10:57.181
<i>No gear on the beach</i>
<i>or anything</i>.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.814
I tied up, and I started
yelling a little bit.

10:59.925 --> 11:03.486
"Tim! Amie!" And no answer.

11:03.596 --> 11:07.191
I caught a little tiny bit
of movement up on the hill,

11:07.299 --> 11:10.757
so I'm like, it was windy, maybe they
just couldn't hear me or something.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.930
So I decided I'd go up
in the camp,

11:14.040 --> 11:16.065
and see what was going on.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.372
And headed off
up through the alders.

11:19.478 --> 11:22.311
It's kind of a thick trail
up into camp there.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.841
Got about three-quarters
of the way up the hill,

11:26.952 --> 11:31.514
and something just didn't feel right at all,
something seemed strange.

11:31.624 --> 11:35.390
I'm yelling and no answer.
So I turned around

11:35.494 --> 11:38.588
and started coming back down the trail
at a pretty good clip, I guess.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.690
I was kinda... trottin' along.

11:41.801 --> 11:45.703
And as I got in the thickest
part of the alders right here,

11:45.805 --> 11:48.569
as I got near the airplane,
I just happened to turn around.

11:48.674 --> 11:51.837
And I turned around
and looked and...

11:54.113 --> 11:58.482
Pretty nasty-Iooking bear
that I had seen here before

11:58.584 --> 12:02.281
is just sneaking slow,
with his head down.

12:02.388 --> 12:06.381
Just the meanest-Iooking thing
coming through the brush.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.756
So I jumped on the airplane
real quick and untied it.

12:08.861 --> 12:12.820
And took off. Turned around,
flew over camp there.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.895
Just looked down
and saw a human rib cage

12:18.003 --> 12:21.939
that I knew had to be
either Tim or Amie laying there.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.441
And he was just eating that.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.977
And as l...
So I circled around again.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.411
<i>Got really low,</i>
<i>and tried to run him off</i>.

12:29.515 --> 12:33.349
<i>Just over and over again with the airplane</i>.
<i>Every time I would come over,</i>

12:33.452 --> 12:36.979
he'd just start eating faster
and faster and crouch over

12:37.089 --> 12:39.580
this rib cage there.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.058
And right at that time,

12:42.161 --> 12:45.927
I just reali <i>z</i> ed, "Wow!

12:46.031 --> 12:49.967
I was pretty close to gettin' eaten myself"
is what I thought.

12:50.069 --> 12:53.197
And this shot of adrenalin like
I've never had just came over me.

12:53.305 --> 12:56.468
And my throat went...
couldn't breathe.

12:56.575 --> 13:00.306
My face went numb.
My arms and legs went numb.

13:00.412 --> 13:03.040
And then I called back...

13:03.149 --> 13:05.413
back to the office,

13:05.518 --> 13:07.952
and told them what happened out here,
what I thought had happened.

13:08.053 --> 13:13.491
And that we would need some assistance
out here. That we had some problems.

13:16.362 --> 13:20.355
After the Park Service arrived,
then I'm leading them up through the alders.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.594
This is the same trail
that I'd come up the first time.

13:23.702 --> 13:27.138
We got to about right here,
and we just stopped.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.673
We stopped just to take
a look around.

13:29.775 --> 13:34.735
Right then, one guy with us
just yells, "Bear!"

13:34.847 --> 13:38.044
And they all spin around. These gun barrels
come over the top of my head.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.243
Boy, they just start
firing them off.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.411
I ducked down 'cause
they hadn't given me a gun.

13:42.521 --> 13:45.217
I'd look up, and they'd fire
over and over again.

13:45.324 --> 13:50.557
Then I look up when they're done firing
and there's just a cloud of smoke here.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.359
I look over, and the bear
is laying right there.

13:53.465 --> 13:56.059
They're yelling at me,
just don't go near the bear.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.136
I knew he was dead.

13:58.237 --> 14:02.071
He'd been shot in the head
and the neck and everywhere.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.905
He was just laying here
pretty much lifeless.

14:06.011 --> 14:10.243
And this is right where...
where the bear...

14:10.349 --> 14:13.443
I told them at the time, I said,
"This is the bear that killed Tim."

14:13.552 --> 14:16.783
I knew, 'cause that was the same bear
that I had seen down here

14:16.889 --> 14:20.757
looking at me right through
the alder bushes there.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.727
So I knew this was the bear.
I said, "Yep, that'll be the one."

14:23.829 --> 14:26.764
That wound up being the bear

14:26.866 --> 14:30.267
that they found Tim in.

14:30.369 --> 14:35.272
I'm here on camera with Olie, the big old bear.
The big old grumpy bear.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.242
He just took Cracker
out of the creek area.

14:39.345 --> 14:41.506
There's not a lot of fish here

14:41.614 --> 14:44.310
so you can understand him wanting
to have control of the creek.

14:44.416 --> 14:47.146
He's acting like
an alpha male here.

14:47.253 --> 14:51.622
Which, I guess, for the fact that he is
the only male here, he is the alpha male.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.818
At any rate, he's also...
He's a surly bear.

14:54.927 --> 14:57.020
I met him on the path
the other day,

14:57.129 --> 15:01.293
after feeling sorry for him, thinking
that he was a bit thin, a bit gaunt...

15:01.400 --> 15:05.461
And he promptly charged me
with the intent to probably strike.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.766
I know the language
of the bear.

15:07.873 --> 15:11.536
I was able to deter him from doing that,
and I'm fine.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.578
But I will tell you something.

15:13.679 --> 15:17.979
It is the old bear, one who is struggling
for survival,

15:18.083 --> 15:21.610
and an aggressive one at that,

15:21.720 --> 15:24.086
who is the one
that you must be very careful of.

15:24.189 --> 15:27.158
For these are the bears,
that on occasion,

15:27.259 --> 15:31.423
do, for survival,
kill and eat humans.

15:31.530 --> 15:35.398
Could Olie, the big old bear,
possibly kill and eat Timothy Treadwell?

15:35.501 --> 15:40.097
What do you think, Olie?
I think if you were weak around him,

15:40.205 --> 15:43.766
you're going down his gullet,
going down the pipe.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.842
<i>Right up top of the hill here</i>
<i>is where we found</i>

15:47.947 --> 15:50.882
<i>what was left of Tim's body</i>...
<i>his head and a little bit of backbone</i>.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.679
And we found

15:53.786 --> 15:57.313
a hand, arm,
wristwatch still on the arm.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.790
I remember the watch.
Shoot, I can remember the watch.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.861
And here's a guy

16:02.962 --> 16:06.659
that used to dive in the lake down here
naked to scare the airplanes away.

16:06.765 --> 16:10.758
And here I'm finding his watch
and arm on top of the hill.

16:10.869 --> 16:15.568
And here's about all that's left
of the bear that killed him.

16:15.674 --> 16:18.939
A few pieces of rib bone.

16:19.044 --> 16:22.480
This bear was shot,
and drug off and eaten

16:22.581 --> 16:25.846
by other bears here,
right in this area.

16:25.951 --> 16:30.388
The tough thing out of all this is Tim would
have never wanted to see any bears killed.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.185
Even if they had killed him,
he would've...

16:33.292 --> 16:36.750
He would've been happy
if nobody found him.

16:36.862 --> 16:40.423
Nobody found any remains.
Nobody found his camp or anything.

16:40.532 --> 16:43.160
He would've been
perfectly content.

16:43.268 --> 16:46.499
He definitely lived
on the edge. But he...

16:47.940 --> 16:50.568
He was a little smarter than everyone
gave him credit for.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.144
He made it out here a long time
before they caught up with him.

16:53.245 --> 16:56.646
And actually the bear
that wound up killing him

16:56.749 --> 16:59.684
was just a dirty rotten bear
that he didn't like anyway.

16:59.785 --> 17:02.379
He wanted to be friends with,
but never happened.

17:04.256 --> 17:07.248
I want to introduce you to one of the key
role players in this year's expedition.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.190
The bear's name is The Grinch.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.955
The Grinch has come on
to be one of the more

17:12.064 --> 17:15.693
frequent bears
here in the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Ma <i>z</i> e.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.598
The Grinch is a female
of about five years of age.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.036
Oh, hi, Grinch. Hi.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.700
And she has kind of
an aggressive attitude.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.503
Hi.

17:25.611 --> 17:30.048
If I turn around too much, she'll bite me.
It's okay. Hi. How are you?

17:30.149 --> 17:31.980
How are you?

17:36.155 --> 17:39.249
Don't you do that.
Don't you do that!

17:40.592 --> 17:42.389
Back off!

17:49.768 --> 17:51.736
Don't do it.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.862
It's okay. I love you.

17:53.972 --> 17:57.100
I love you. I love you.
I love you.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.302
I love you. I'm sorry.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.276
I'm Sam Egli.

18:02.381 --> 18:05.009
I was called out as a helicopter pilot

18:05.117 --> 18:10.749
to assist on the cleanup after
the Treadwell tragedy of last winter.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.790
I was in there the morning

18:12.891 --> 18:16.292
<i>the Fish and Game officers</i>
<i>were there examining</i>

18:16.395 --> 18:20.957
<i>the bear that had done</i>
<i>the killing</i>.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.829
<i>The bear was all cut open</i>.

18:22.935 --> 18:27.338
It was full of people.
It was full of clothing. It was...

18:27.439 --> 18:31.671
We hauled away
four garbage bags of people

18:31.777 --> 18:33.540
out of that bear.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.380
Treadwell was, I think,

18:39.485 --> 18:41.612
meaning well, trying to do things

18:41.720 --> 18:45.417
to help the resource of the bears.

18:45.524 --> 18:49.551
But to me
he was acting like...

18:49.661 --> 18:53.222
like he was working with people

18:53.332 --> 18:57.393
wearing bear costumes out there
instead of wild animals.

18:58.737 --> 19:01.331
Those bears are big
and ferocious,

19:01.440 --> 19:04.876
and they come equipped
to kill ya and eat ya.

19:04.977 --> 19:09.107
And that's just what
Treadwell was asking for.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.307
He got what
he was asking for.

19:11.416 --> 19:14.510
He got what he deserved,
in my opinion.

19:14.620 --> 19:19.080
The tragedy of it
was taking the girl with him.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.493
I think the only reason

19:22.594 --> 19:27.554
that Treadwell lasted
as long in the game as he did

19:27.666 --> 19:32.694
was that the bears probably thought
there was something wrong with him.

19:32.804 --> 19:36.968
Like he was mentally retarded
or something.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.411
That bear, I think,
that day decided that he had

19:44.516 --> 19:48.213
either had enough
of Tim Treadwell,

19:48.320 --> 19:52.882
or that something clicked
in that bear's head

19:52.991 --> 19:56.392
that he thought, "Hey, you know,
he might be good to eat."

19:57.930 --> 20:00.398
<i>My opinion,</i>
<i>I think Treadwell thought</i>

20:00.499 --> 20:04.435
<i>these bears were big,</i>
<i>scary looking, harmless creatures</i>

20:04.536 --> 20:07.334
<i>that he could go up and pet</i>
<i>and sing to,</i>

20:07.439 --> 20:10.203
- <i>and they would bond</i>
- Look it there!

20:10.309 --> 20:13.972
<i>As children of the universe</i>
<i>or some odd</i>.

20:14.079 --> 20:19.540
<i>I think he had lost sight</i>
<i>of what was really going on</i>.

20:32.798 --> 20:35.062
<i>He wanted to become like the bear</i>.

20:35.167 --> 20:38.603
Perhaps it was religious,
but not in the true sense of religion.

20:38.704 --> 20:42.504
I think perhaps he wanted to

20:42.608 --> 20:44.007
mutate into a wild animal

20:44.109 --> 20:46.339
as he says in this last letter.

20:46.445 --> 20:49.972
He says, "I have to mutually
mutate into a wild animal

20:50.082 --> 20:52.209
to handle the life
I live out here."

20:52.317 --> 20:55.252
I think there's
a religious sense in that

20:55.354 --> 20:59.984
in the sense of connecting so deeply
that you're no longer human.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.686
And that is a religious experience.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.861
Here's another example.

21:05.964 --> 21:10.401
"There are many times that
I feel death is the best option.

21:10.502 --> 21:13.699
My work would be
much more seriously looked at

21:13.805 --> 21:17.400
and possibly make the difference
that in living, I can't do."

21:17.509 --> 21:20.808
I think that was
sort of a paradox for him.

21:20.912 --> 21:25.406
That he felt not worthy enough
to get his message across at times.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.008
And so, maybe,
in the drama of death

21:28.120 --> 21:31.487
his message would be more poignant
and reach out to more people.

21:31.590 --> 21:35.390
<i>But his message stirred</i>
<i>a lot of controversy</i>.

21:35.494 --> 21:39.362
<i>The Gaedes have collected</i>
<i>thousands of angry letters</i>.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.523
I can read you some of...

21:41.633 --> 21:45.569
I picked out three
of these vitriolic hate mails.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.640
They cover the gamut.

21:50.275 --> 21:53.005
"Stereotypical environmentalist.

21:53.111 --> 21:55.341
Just as long as the donations
keep coming,

21:55.447 --> 21:59.975
furthering the antihuman
eco-religion as a noble cause,

22:00.085 --> 22:02.053
who cares about reality?"

22:02.154 --> 22:05.317
And the very idea

22:05.424 --> 22:09.326
that Timothy made a lot of money
doing what he did

22:09.428 --> 22:13.455
is absolutely preposterous, 'cause
he's one of the poorest people we knew.

22:13.565 --> 22:15.726
Another one.

22:15.834 --> 22:19.736
"A bear diet consists
of liberals and Dems,"

22:19.838 --> 22:21.362
meaning Democrats.

22:21.473 --> 22:25.239
"A bear diet consists of liberals and Dems
and wacko environmentalists

22:25.344 --> 22:29.110
that think the spotted owl
is the most important thing in the world.

22:29.214 --> 22:33.378
We need to somehow drastically increase
the number of bears in America,

22:33.485 --> 22:37.751
especially in such key spots
as the Berkeley campus."

22:41.159 --> 22:44.322
<i>I, too, would like to step in here</i>
<i>in his defense,</i>

22:44.429 --> 22:48.229
<i>not as an ecologist,</i>
<i>but as a filmmaker</i>.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.928
<i>He captured such glorious</i>
<i>improvised moments,</i>

22:52.037 --> 22:54.198
<i>the likes of which</i>
<i>the studio directors,</i>

22:54.306 --> 22:57.707
<i>with their union crews,</i>
<i>can never dream of</i>.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.179
Okay.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.978
What are you doing up there?
That's where you're sitting?

23:21.633 --> 23:23.897
There. Go.

23:24.002 --> 23:28.564
Go! Go! Go!

23:29.574 --> 23:31.906
Come on! Come on!

23:33.145 --> 23:35.739
Come on! Run home!

23:46.191 --> 23:48.022
Come on!

24:09.481 --> 24:10.778
Hi.

24:10.882 --> 24:13.180
Hey, you little champion.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.480
Hi. How are you?

24:15.587 --> 24:17.452
You're such a good champion.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.047
I love you. I love you.

24:21.159 --> 24:23.684
Get up there,
and guard that tent.

24:32.103 --> 24:34.571
I'm here with one of my favorite bears.
It's Mr. Chocolate.

24:34.673 --> 24:36.607
Hi, Mr. Chocolate.

24:36.708 --> 24:40.337
He is the star of many people
across the country:

24:40.445 --> 24:42.436
Children, people, adults.

24:42.547 --> 24:44.412
And we're here
in the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Sanctuary.

24:44.516 --> 24:47.144
But I'm wrapping up my work
in the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Sanctuary. Why is that?

24:47.252 --> 24:49.117
Because I'm on my way
to the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Ma <i>z</i> e

24:49.221 --> 24:53.590
where bears do not have human protection,
but are under human threat.

24:53.692 --> 24:57.822
Bears like Aunt Melissa. Bears like Demon,
Hatchet, Downey and Tabitha.

24:57.929 --> 24:59.863
And it's time for me
to go to protect them.

24:59.965 --> 25:02.024
I wish I could bring
Mr. Chocolate with me.

25:02.133 --> 25:04.033
You'd be great protection there.

25:04.135 --> 25:07.798
He's been with me for over a decade, and he's
been my good friend and I appreciate it.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.431
Thank you, Mr. Chocolate.
I'll see you again next year.

25:10.542 --> 25:14.000
No. I'll see him again at expedition...
end of this expedition.

25:14.112 --> 25:17.411
I'll be back here to join you again.
Back with Mr. Chocolate.

25:17.516 --> 25:22.146
But first, it's off to the exciting
and often dangerous Gri <i>zz</i> ly Ma <i>z</i> e.

25:23.421 --> 25:26.322
<i>Now the scene seems to be over</i>.

25:26.424 --> 25:30.292
<i>But as a filmmaker,</i>
<i>sometimes things fall into your lap</i>

25:30.395 --> 25:32.955
<i>which you couldn't expect,</i>
<i>never even dream of</i>.

25:33.064 --> 25:34.793
Hi, Spirit.

25:34.900 --> 25:38.563
<i>There is something like</i>
<i>an inexplicable magic of cinema</i>.

25:39.905 --> 25:41.497
Hi, Spirit.

25:44.409 --> 25:48.903
Well, I'm here with Mr. Chocolate
and Spirit, the fox.

25:49.014 --> 25:51.881
And here comes
some of her pups. Yea!

25:51.983 --> 25:53.814
Here comes
some of her pups.

25:56.021 --> 25:57.784
Hi.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.559
Hi, Spirit.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.293
Hi, Spirit. Hello, baby.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.860
Coming down.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.070
What are you doing to that hat?

26:18.176 --> 26:19.905
Where's that hat going?

26:37.996 --> 26:40.191
Hey, who's stealing that hat?

26:40.298 --> 26:43.961
Let me see that hat.
Ghost, I want that hat.

26:45.036 --> 26:47.698
Man! Ghost is bad.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.305
Ghost, what are you doing
with that hat?

26:51.409 --> 26:54.003
Ghost, that hat
is a very important hat.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.808
Drop it! Hey!

26:57.949 --> 27:00.509
Oh, goddamn it!

27:00.619 --> 27:03.144
I can't believe this!

27:03.254 --> 27:05.119
Ghost!

27:05.223 --> 27:07.316
Ghost, where's that fucking hat?

27:07.425 --> 27:10.861
That hat is so frigging valuable
for this trip.

27:10.962 --> 27:14.090
Ghost, you come back here
with that friggin' hat.

27:14.199 --> 27:17.225
If it's in the den,
I'm gonna fucking explode.

27:17.335 --> 27:19.166
Ghost, where's that hat?

27:19.270 --> 27:21.363
It's not okay for you to steal it.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.806
Oh, man!

27:24.909 --> 27:26.274
Oh, man!

27:27.412 --> 27:29.642
It's a friggin' den.

27:29.914 --> 27:32.439
One of the things I've
heard about Mr. Treadwell,

27:32.550 --> 27:34.643
and you can see
in a lot of his films,

27:34.753 --> 27:37.654
is that he tended
to want to become a bear.

27:37.756 --> 27:41.556
Some people that I've spoken with would
encounter him in the field,

27:41.660 --> 27:43.924
and he would act like a bear,
he would "woof" at them.

27:44.029 --> 27:48.796
He would act in the same way a bear
would when they were surprised.

27:48.900 --> 27:53.997
Why he did this is only known to him.
No one really knows for sure.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.369
But when you spend
a lot of time with bears,

27:56.474 --> 27:59.568
especially when you're in the field
with them day after day,

27:59.678 --> 28:01.737
there's a siren song,
there's a calling

28:01.846 --> 28:04.440
that makes you wanna come in
and spend more time in the world.

28:04.549 --> 28:06.779
<i>Because it is a simpler world</i>.

28:06.885 --> 28:08.910
<i>It is a wonderful thing,</i>

28:09.020 --> 28:11.079
<i>but in fact</i>
<i>it's a harsh world</i>.

28:11.189 --> 28:14.022
<i>It's a different world that bears</i>
<i>live in than we do</i>.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.958
<i>So there is that desire</i>
<i>to get into their world,</i>

28:17.062 --> 28:21.055
<i>but the reality is we never can because</i>
<i>we're very different than they are</i>.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.944
<i>The line between bear and human</i>

28:42.053 --> 28:45.284
<i>has apparently always</i>
<i>been respected</i>

28:45.390 --> 28:47.915
<i>by the native communities</i>
<i>of Alaska</i>.

28:48.026 --> 28:51.928
<i>We visited the curator</i>
<i>of Kodiak's Alutiiq Museum,</i>

28:52.030 --> 28:57.593
<i>which had recently been raided</i>
<i>by tourists out of control</i>.

28:57.702 --> 29:01.229
Somebody wanted it so much,
they cut the paw off.

29:01.339 --> 29:03.705
They stole it from here.

29:03.808 --> 29:07.471
It was quite tragic for us
because it's on loan

29:07.579 --> 29:11.106
and they came in and took it.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.784
And how do you see
Timothy Treadwell's story?

29:15.887 --> 29:18.981
I see it as something that's both...

29:20.225 --> 29:23.456
It's tragic because,

29:23.561 --> 29:25.756
yeah, he died
and his girlfriend died

29:25.864 --> 29:28.765
because he tried to be a bear.

29:28.867 --> 29:32.826
He tried to act like a bear, and for us
on the island, you don't do that.

29:32.937 --> 29:36.065
You don't invade
on their territory.

29:36.174 --> 29:37.471
You...

29:37.575 --> 29:39.873
When you're in their territory,
you know you're there.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.776
And when you're nearby,

29:42.881 --> 29:45.748
you make sure that
they know you're around.

29:47.519 --> 29:51.478
You know, for him to act
like a bear the way he did,

29:51.589 --> 29:53.352
would be...

29:54.492 --> 29:56.392
I don't know.
To me, it was the ultimate

29:56.494 --> 29:59.952
of disrespecting the bear
and what the bear represents.

30:00.064 --> 30:03.625
But he tried to protect the bears,
didn't he?

30:05.503 --> 30:07.801
I think he did more damage
to the bears than he did...

30:07.906 --> 30:12.502
Because when you habituate bears to
humans, they think all humans are safe.

30:13.711 --> 30:17.272
<i>Where I grew up, the bears avoid us</i>
<i>and we avoid them</i>.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.612
<i>They're not habituated to us</i>.

30:19.717 --> 30:23.050
<i>If I look at it from my culture,</i>
<i>Timothy Treadwell crossed a boundary</i>

30:23.154 --> 30:26.646
<i>that we have lived with</i>
<i>for 7,000 years</i>.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.726
<i>It's an unspoken boundary,</i>
<i>an unknown boundary</i>.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.557
<i>But when we know</i>
<i>we've crossed it,</i>

30:31.663 --> 30:33.927
<i>we pay the price</i>.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.558
Jewel, I apologi <i>z</i> e

31:10.668 --> 31:14.968
that this wristwatch
is still in an evidence bag.

31:15.073 --> 31:18.975
However, I want you to have this watch.

31:19.077 --> 31:22.410
I think that it is important
that you have it.

31:23.781 --> 31:26.215
You knew Timothy for a long time.

31:26.317 --> 31:29.309
My understanding is that you lived together
for three years.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.320
You were very close to him.

31:31.422 --> 31:33.652
Yeah. He was my boyfriend for three years.
He was my boss.

31:33.758 --> 31:37.285
He was a lot of things
to me in 20 years.

31:37.395 --> 31:41.161
I understand that. And that's the reason
I want you to have this.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.359
This really should be yours.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.963
- This watch is still running.
- Oh, wow.

31:47.071 --> 31:51.269
It has been running continuously
since the time that I received it.

31:51.376 --> 31:54.607
This was taken off Timothy's wrist.

31:55.713 --> 31:58.807
Wow! There it is.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.717
It's still running. I can't even believe it.
I can't believe it.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.219
I'm gonna wear it.

32:04.322 --> 32:07.849
And I'm gonna remember him,
and I'm gonna remember Amie.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.621
Can you speak about Amie?

32:12.163 --> 32:16.600
Amie was brave
and Amie was strong.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.636
Amie was my friend
and she was Timothy's friend.

32:19.737 --> 32:23.332
She was his girlfriend, but most important,
she was his friend.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.931
And...

32:26.177 --> 32:31.114
And I believe that
I'm gonna honor their choice.

32:31.215 --> 32:35.049
I'm always gonna respect them for
what they did, and for how they did it.

32:35.153 --> 32:38.554
And for being out there,
and for protecting bears

32:38.656 --> 32:41.090
and living in wild nature.

32:41.192 --> 32:44.389
And living their life to the fullest.

32:44.495 --> 32:47.862
They truly died
doing what they lived for.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.802
Representing Timothy.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.871
And then I'll fill in the rest.
That's the specific number.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.942
- So there it is.
- So there it is.

32:58.042 --> 33:01.205
Full circle. I've got it all.
I can't even believe it.

33:01.312 --> 33:05.180
- Hopefully it will continue to run a long time.
- I think it will.

33:05.283 --> 33:06.750
Very good.

33:16.394 --> 33:18.294
It's the last thing that's left.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.363
Thanks, Franc.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.101
Jewel Palovak,

33:29.907 --> 33:32.899
you were very close
to Timothy Treadwell.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.912
Do you sometimes
feel like his widow?

33:36.948 --> 33:39.041
Do I feel like his widow?

33:41.285 --> 33:43.810
Yeah, you know,
in some ways I do.

33:43.921 --> 33:46.981
I feel like his widow because

33:47.091 --> 33:52.620
everything that he had,
everything that he worked for,

33:52.730 --> 33:54.755
he left to me.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.562
<i>I was his girlfriend</i>.

33:57.668 --> 34:00.296
<i>I was his employee</i>.

34:00.405 --> 34:05.468
<i>I was the person that figured</i>
<i>all the last-minute details out</i>.

34:05.576 --> 34:08.909
You also founded a foundation
with him?

34:09.013 --> 34:11.174
Yeah. We did.
We founded Gri <i>zz</i> ly People,

34:11.282 --> 34:15.275
whose mission is to protect
and preserve habitat worldwide.

34:17.522 --> 34:21.652
<i>For Treadwell, who had</i>
<i>a natural tendency towards chaos,</i>

34:21.759 --> 34:25.489
<i>Grizzly People served</i>
<i>as his organized platform,</i>

34:25.596 --> 34:29.429
<i>and Jewel was his</i>
<i>most trusted co-combatant</i>.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.733
<i>I met him in a restaurant</i>.

34:32.837 --> 34:35.362
<i>We both worked at this place</i>
<i>called Gulliver's</i>.

34:35.473 --> 34:38.442
<i>It was a prime rib restaurant</i>.
<i>It was huge and theatrical</i>.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.976
Timothy was a squire,
'cause it was set in the time...

34:41.079 --> 34:43.309
It was based
on <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>.

34:43.414 --> 34:46.406
He had a chint <i>z</i> y felt hat

34:46.516 --> 34:49.350
and a cheap plastic apron
and some knickers

34:49.454 --> 34:51.945
and that blond hair
just sticking out.

34:52.056 --> 34:55.617
And me, I would be your English
serving wench for the evening.

34:55.726 --> 34:58.217
You had to toss the salad
with aplomb,

34:58.329 --> 35:01.423
and you had to boil the soup
and serve it to the people.

35:01.532 --> 35:04.467
I had seen Timothy,
and he was kind of fun.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.560
I didn't really know who he was.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.662
And one night, I just wasn't
in the best of moods.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.742
I had a huge table.
A family of people that wanted me

35:11.843 --> 35:14.903
to make it the best dining experience
of their life.

35:15.012 --> 35:18.743
Do it up big. Make the soup big, you know.
Use the vernacular.

35:18.850 --> 35:23.150
There was grandmas and babies
and hairdos and coats.

35:23.254 --> 35:26.917
So I thought, "You know what? I'll make it.
I'll make it big for ya.

35:27.024 --> 35:30.585
I'll make it really big.
You'll never forget this birthday."

35:30.695 --> 35:33.687
So, one of the parts
was you'd take the soup cart,

35:33.798 --> 35:37.290
and you'd light it up with this gas
so that the soup was bubbling and boiling.

35:37.401 --> 35:39.460
You could smell
the deliciousness.

35:39.570 --> 35:42.232
And I decided to make it
really big.

35:42.340 --> 35:45.832
So I trailed a little bit
extra of the lighter fluid

35:45.943 --> 35:47.911
around the polyester cloth,

35:48.012 --> 35:52.676
and I kind of miscalculated
because the soup exploded.

35:52.783 --> 35:56.014
The people screamed,
the fire went everywhere.

35:56.120 --> 35:59.214
So I was called into the office
in the next couple of days.

35:59.323 --> 36:02.622
And who do I see
when I sit down in the office,

36:02.727 --> 36:06.288
waiting like you're in the jail or
you're in the principal's office?

36:06.397 --> 36:08.456
I see Timothy Treadwell.

36:08.566 --> 36:11.626
I was like, "Hey, How are you?
I know I've seen you. I'm Jewel."

36:11.736 --> 36:14.204
He said, "I'm Tim."
I said, "What are you in for?"

36:14.305 --> 36:17.001
He said, "I'm in for walking funny
in the dining room."

36:17.108 --> 36:19.474
He said, "What did you do?"
I said, "I lit the soup cart on fire."

36:19.577 --> 36:23.274
He said, "That was you?"
And you know,

36:23.381 --> 36:27.044
it wasn't love at first sight,
but it was certainly kindred spirits.

36:28.386 --> 36:32.322
Only Timmy is the boss
of all foxes and all bears.

36:32.423 --> 36:34.448
You're their ruler.

36:34.559 --> 36:36.459
Look at that face.

36:37.762 --> 36:40.230
Hey, thanks for being my friend.

36:40.331 --> 36:43.732
This is so good.
Does that feel good?

36:45.169 --> 36:47.330
We patrol the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Sanctuary together.
How did we meet?

36:47.438 --> 36:50.601
Over a decade ago.
He left his mother and father's side,

36:50.708 --> 36:54.235
promptly peed on my shoes,
pooped on my clothes, that was it.

36:54.345 --> 36:58.577
<i>He was my friend. Timmy, the fox. Yep</i>.
<i>And we watch over things</i>.

36:58.683 --> 37:01.447
<i>And he's the boss</i>.
<i>Takes care of everything</i>.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.749
<i>Yep, yep. He says,</i>
<i>"I love the way you pet."</i>

37:04.855 --> 37:08.916
I think one of the things that's really important
is you can see the bond

37:09.026 --> 37:12.154
that has developed between
this very wild animal

37:12.263 --> 37:15.596
and this very,
fairly wild person.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.691
And you reali <i>z</i> e
he has this gorgeous fur,

37:17.802 --> 37:19.793
and people are trying
to kill him for it

37:19.904 --> 37:22.873
with steel door traps
and cruel farming practices.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.636
And other people run him down
on horses for sport.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.837
Fox hunting.
We want this to end.

37:28.946 --> 37:32.677
Between Timmy, the fox, this beautiful fox,
and me, we ask the public,

37:32.783 --> 37:38.085
please stop killing and hurting these foxes
and torturing them.

37:38.189 --> 37:39.850
Don't you think?

37:39.957 --> 37:42.323
If they knew how beautiful he was,
and how sweet he was,

37:42.426 --> 37:44.451
they would never hurt him.

37:44.562 --> 37:46.257
Thanks.

37:46.364 --> 37:50.596
<i>Timothy used his camera as a tool</i>
<i>to get his message across</i>.

37:50.701 --> 37:53.261
<i>Sometimes it was very playful</i>.

37:53.371 --> 37:57.068
Do another take here. I fucked up the last
one. Almost fell off the cliff.

37:57.174 --> 38:00.109
I'm a fucking asshole.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.441
Behind me is the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Sanctuary
and also behind me,

38:02.546 --> 38:06.676
hidden down below in those trees somewhere,
is my camp.

38:06.784 --> 38:10.242
I must stay incognito.
I must hide from the authorities.

38:10.354 --> 38:12.754
I must hide from people
who would harm me.

38:12.857 --> 38:15.519
I must now hide from people
that seek me out

38:15.626 --> 38:18.356
because I've made some sort of,

38:18.462 --> 38:20.453
I don't want to say celebrity,

38:20.564 --> 38:23.362
but they come to Alaska
and hear about Treadwell in the bush

38:23.467 --> 38:25.492
and they want to go find him.

38:25.603 --> 38:27.901
Well, they can't.
I'm hidden down below.

38:28.005 --> 38:31.372
No one knows where I am.
Even I don't know where I am.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.102
That's pretty shitty.

38:33.210 --> 38:35.576
Let's do a really short take here.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.615
<i>But as a filmmaker,</i>
<i>he was methodical</i>.

38:38.716 --> 38:41.549
- Whatever.
- <i>Often repeating takes 15 times</i>.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.745
One more really short,
excellent take.

38:43.854 --> 38:48.848
Let's just really sum it up. Here we go.
This is gonna be the motherfucker.

38:48.959 --> 38:52.554
Behind me is the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Sanctuary,
and also hidden below is my camp.

38:52.663 --> 38:56.895
For I must now remain hidden from the
authorities, from people who would harm me,

38:57.001 --> 38:59.162
from people who would
seek me out as a story.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.568
My future helping the animals
depends on it.

39:01.672 --> 39:04.505
I must be a spirit
in the wilderness.

39:06.944 --> 39:09.674
<i>With himself as the central character,</i>

39:09.780 --> 39:12.271
<i>he began to craft his own movie,</i>

39:12.383 --> 39:15.716
<i>something way beyond</i>
<i>the wildlife film</i>.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.220
There is going to be a number of takes
I'm gonna do.

39:18.322 --> 39:20.222
These are called
"Wild Timmy Jungle Scenes."

39:20.324 --> 39:22.451
We're gonna do
several takes of each

39:22.560 --> 39:25.927
where I'll do it with a bandanna on,
maybe a bandanna off.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.998
Maybe two different
colored bandannas.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.726
Some without a bandanna,

39:29.834 --> 39:32.564
some with the camera
being held.

39:35.172 --> 39:38.938
I kind of stumbled.
Let's do it again.

39:39.043 --> 39:43.503
So the basic deal is that this stuff
could be cut into a show later on,

39:43.614 --> 39:48.551
but who knows what look I had, whether
I had the black bandanna or no bandanna.

39:48.652 --> 39:52.053
Very rarely the camo one,
but I like the camo look.

39:55.526 --> 39:59.053
Both cameras rolling. Both cameras rolling.
Both cameras rolling!

40:00.998 --> 40:04.058
Sexy green bandanna,
last take of the evening.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.102
I'm on my way to the creek.
I need to get water.

40:06.203 --> 40:10.503
And there's a super-duper low tide.
Full moon tonight, and action.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.667
<i>In his action movie mode,</i>

40:12.777 --> 40:15.109
<i>Treadwell probably did not realize</i>

40:15.212 --> 40:20.616
<i>that seemingly empty moments</i>
<i>had a strange, secret beauty</i>.

40:20.718 --> 40:24.586
<i>Sometimes images themselves</i>
<i>developed their own life,</i>

40:24.688 --> 40:27.657
<i>their own mysterious stardom</i>.

40:39.703 --> 40:41.500
Starsky and Hutch. Over.

40:45.509 --> 40:47.409
<i>Beyond his posings,</i>

40:47.511 --> 40:51.174
<i>the camera was his only</i>
<i>present companion</i>.

40:51.282 --> 40:55.150
<i>It was his instrument to explore</i>
<i>the wilderness around him,</i>

40:55.252 --> 40:59.154
<i>but increasingly</i>
<i>it became something more</i>.

40:59.256 --> 41:02.521
<i>He started to scrutinize</i>
<i>his innermost being,</i>

41:02.626 --> 41:06.153
<i>his demons,</i>
<i>his exhilarations</i>.

41:06.263 --> 41:11.200
<i>Facing the lens of a camera took</i>
<i>on the quality of a confessional</i>.

41:14.371 --> 41:16.430
<i>Covering various years,</i>

41:16.540 --> 41:20.306
<i>the following samples illustrate</i>
<i>the search for himself</i>.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.947
If there... I have no idea
if there's a God.

41:24.048 --> 41:27.245
But if there's a God, God would
be very, very... pleased with me.

41:27.351 --> 41:29.546
If he could just watch me here,
how much I love them,

41:29.653 --> 41:33.350
how much I adore them,
how respectful I am to them.

41:33.457 --> 41:35.357
How I am one of them.

41:35.459 --> 41:39.054
And how the studies they give me,
the photographs, the video...

41:39.163 --> 41:41.825
And take that around
for no charge

41:41.932 --> 41:44.594
to people around the world.

41:44.702 --> 41:48.103
It's good work. I feel good about it.
I feel good about myself doing it.

41:48.205 --> 41:52.642
And I want to continue, and I hope I can.
I really hope I can.

41:52.743 --> 41:55.803
But if not, be warned.

41:55.913 --> 41:59.872
I will die for these animals. I will die for
these animals. I will die for these animals.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.282
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

42:02.386 --> 42:06.482
Thank you so much for these animals,
for giving me a life.

42:06.590 --> 42:10.458
I had no life.
Now I have a life.

42:17.968 --> 42:19.936
Now, enough of that.

42:21.572 --> 42:24.370
Now let the expedition continue.
It's off to Timmy, the fox.

42:24.475 --> 42:26.773
We've gotta find Banjo.
He's missing!

42:26.877 --> 42:29.243
And that's my story here,

42:29.346 --> 42:31.940
for me, Timothy Treadwell,

42:32.049 --> 42:34.244
the kind warrior.

42:34.351 --> 42:36.819
Can I take it?

42:36.921 --> 42:38.786
I'm trying.

42:38.889 --> 42:41.016
Okay, yeah, I can do it.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.559
Yeah. Why not? Why not?

42:44.628 --> 42:46.960
I've crossed the halfway point.

42:47.064 --> 42:50.795
Government's given me
all they have. So far.

42:50.901 --> 42:53.199
I've stood up to it.

42:53.304 --> 42:56.762
I've had danger in the boat, almost died.
I've almost fallen off a cliff.

42:56.874 --> 43:00.310
Yeah. The danger factor's
about to amp up in the Ma <i>z</i> e.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.845
The Ma <i>z</i> e is always
the most dangerous.

43:03.981 --> 43:06.541
Lord, I do not want
to be hurt by a bear.

43:06.650 --> 43:08.481
I do not.

43:08.586 --> 43:12.613
I always cannot understand why girls
don't wanna be with me for a long time,

43:12.723 --> 43:15.089
because I have really
a nice personality.

43:15.192 --> 43:17.126
I'm fun.

43:17.227 --> 43:20.719
I'm very, very good in the... You're not
supposed to say that when you're a guy.

43:20.831 --> 43:23.265
But I know I am.
They know I am.

43:23.367 --> 43:25.528
And...

43:28.505 --> 43:31.531
I don't fight with them,
I'm so passive.

43:31.642 --> 43:33.542
Bit of a patsy!

43:33.644 --> 43:36.374
Is that a turnoff to girls,
to be a patsy?

43:36.480 --> 43:40.280
I mean it's not... it's not
that I'm a total great guy.

43:40.384 --> 43:43.410
I'm a lot of fun
and have a good life going.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.216
I don't know what's going on.

43:46.323 --> 43:49.190
I always wished I was gay.
Would've been a lot easier.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.284
You know?
You can just "bing-bing-bing."

43:51.395 --> 43:55.297
Gay guys have no problem. I mean,
they go to restrooms and truck stops,

43:55.399 --> 43:57.959
and they perform sex.

43:58.068 --> 44:00.662
It's like so easy for 'em and stuff.

44:00.771 --> 44:04.969
But you know what?
Alas, Timothy Treadwell is not gay. Bummer!

44:05.075 --> 44:08.408
I love girls! And girls...

44:08.512 --> 44:10.810
Girls need a lot more...

44:10.914 --> 44:13.815
need a lot more, you know,

44:13.917 --> 44:18.752
finesse and care,
and I like that a bit.

44:18.856 --> 44:21.222
But when it goes bad
and you're alone,

44:21.325 --> 44:22.883
it's like...

44:23.927 --> 44:25.189
Well,

44:26.330 --> 44:30.027
you know, you can't rebound
like you can if you were gay.

44:30.134 --> 44:32.068
I'm sure gay people
have problems too,

44:32.169 --> 44:36.162
but not as much as one goofy straight guy
named Timothy Treadwell.

44:36.273 --> 44:39.674
Anyway, that's my story.
That's my story.

44:41.412 --> 44:44.609
I love you. Look at you.

44:44.715 --> 44:47.275
You're the best little fox.

44:47.384 --> 44:49.818
But how did I come
into this work, Iris?

44:49.920 --> 44:51.785
Did you ever get the story?

44:51.889 --> 44:55.586
I was troubled. I was troubled.
I drank a lot.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.957
Did you know that?
You wouldn't even know what that is.

44:58.062 --> 45:02.465
But I used to drink
to the point of

45:02.566 --> 45:07.265
that I guess I was either gonna die
from it or break free of it.

45:07.371 --> 45:11.307
But nothing, nothing, Iris,
could get me from... to stop drinking.

45:11.408 --> 45:15.003
Nothing! I went to programs.
I tried quitting myself.

45:15.112 --> 45:18.946
I did everything that I could
to try not to drink,

45:19.049 --> 45:21.517
and then I did everything
I could to drink.

45:21.618 --> 45:24.018
And... And it was killing me

45:24.121 --> 45:27.113
until I discovered
this land of bears

45:27.224 --> 45:30.557
<i>and realized that they were in</i>
<i>such great danger</i>

45:30.661 --> 45:34.062
<i>that they needed a caretaker, they needed</i>
<i>someone to look after them</i>.

45:34.164 --> 45:36.325
<i>But not a drunk person</i>.
<i>Not a person messed up</i>.

45:36.433 --> 45:40.802
<i>So I promised the bears</i>
<i>that if I would look over them,</i>

45:40.904 --> 45:45.773
<i>would they please help me</i>
<i>be a better person and</i>

45:45.876 --> 45:48.709
they've become so inspirational,

45:48.812 --> 45:51.576
and living with the foxes too,

45:51.682 --> 45:53.616
that I did, I gave up the drinking.

45:53.717 --> 45:55.617
It was a miracle.
It was an absolute miracle.

45:55.719 --> 45:59.280
And the miracle was animals.
The miracle was animals.

46:03.093 --> 46:07.052
I live here. It's very dangerous.
It's really dangerous.

46:07.164 --> 46:09.997
I run wild with the bears.
I run so wild, so free,

46:10.100 --> 46:14.059
so like a child
with these animals.

46:14.171 --> 46:18.335
It's really cool.
And it's very serious.

46:19.676 --> 46:22.008
<i>I'm here alone,</i>
<i>and when you're all alone</i>

46:22.112 --> 46:24.842
<i>you do get</i>... <i>you get lonely</i>.

46:24.948 --> 46:27.815
<i>Oh, duhl Right?</i>
<i>You get pretty lonely</i>.

46:32.923 --> 46:36.723
Oh, no. I'm gonna do all this stuff because
I'm supposed to be alone.

46:36.827 --> 46:38.158
Oh. Okay.

46:40.531 --> 46:42.522
<i>Part of the mythical character</i>

46:42.633 --> 46:45.067
<i>Treadwell was transforming</i>
<i>himself into</i>

46:45.169 --> 46:49.833
<i>required him to be seen</i>
<i>as being completely alone</i>.

46:49.940 --> 46:53.467
<i>He was mostly alone,</i>
<i>but he did spend time with women</i>

46:53.577 --> 46:56.375
<i>who will here</i>
<i>remain anonymous</i>.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.846
<i>The truth is that</i>
<i>Amie Huguenard</i>

46:58.949 --> 47:02.146
<i>accompanied him for parts</i>
<i>of his last two summers</i>.

47:02.252 --> 47:05.881
<i>A fact which was out of step</i>
<i>with his stylization</i>

47:05.989 --> 47:08.981
<i>as the lone guardian</i>
<i>of the grizzlies</i>.

47:11.595 --> 47:16.328
It's July 26, and I've been dropped off
all alone again here in the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Ma <i>z</i> e.

47:16.433 --> 47:19.527
And it's always such a surreal
feeling as the plane takes off.

47:19.636 --> 47:23.595
And it doesn't quite sink
into you just how alone you are.

47:23.707 --> 47:25.698
That for the next
two months or more

47:25.809 --> 47:28.175
you will be alone
in this wild wilderness,

47:28.278 --> 47:32.078
this jungle that the bears
have carved tunnels through.

47:32.182 --> 47:34.275
And that's the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Ma <i>z</i> e.

47:34.384 --> 47:36.818
It's July 26.
I hope to survive

47:36.920 --> 47:39.650
and to be able to record
the secret world of the bears.

47:39.756 --> 47:43.214
And come September when people
might come to harm these animals,

47:43.327 --> 47:46.125
I'll look after them,
I'll make sure they're safe.

47:51.268 --> 47:54.795
It is so weird, though,
when it sinks in,

47:54.905 --> 47:57.339
how alone you are.

48:01.812 --> 48:06.875
<i>Amie Huguenard remains</i>
<i>a great unknown of this film</i>.

48:06.984 --> 48:09.953
<i>Her family declined</i>
<i>to appear on camera,</i>

48:10.053 --> 48:13.989
<i>and Amie herself remains hidden</i>
<i>in Treadwell's footage</i>.

48:14.091 --> 48:16.992
<i>In nearly 100 hours</i>
<i>of his video,</i>

48:17.094 --> 48:20.427
<i>she appears</i>
<i>exactly two times</i>.

48:20.530 --> 48:25.627
<i>Here disembarking from the plane</i>
<i>in the year of her death</i>.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.499
<i>We never see her face</i>.

48:27.604 --> 48:31.335
<i>Here it is obscured</i>
<i>by her hands and her hair</i>.

48:31.441 --> 48:33.932
Greetings, children of America.

48:36.113 --> 48:40.015
<i>The second shot that we have</i>
<i>doesn't show her face either</i>.

48:40.117 --> 48:43.609
<i>She remains a mystery,</i>
<i>veiled by a mosquito net,</i>

48:43.720 --> 48:45.688
<i>obscured, unknown</i>.

48:47.758 --> 48:49.749
<i>Only through Treadwell's diaries</i>

48:49.860 --> 48:52.988
<i>do we know that</i>
<i>she was frightened of bears</i>.

48:58.568 --> 49:01.401
<i>The only other hint</i>
<i>we have of her presence</i>

49:01.505 --> 49:03.871
<i>is this shot here of Treadwell</i>.

49:03.974 --> 49:06.807
<i>It is handheld,</i>
<i>and we can only deduct</i>

49:06.910 --> 49:10.311
<i>it must have been Amie</i>
<i>operating the camera</i>.

49:19.957 --> 49:22.824
Timothy Treadwell
and Amie Huguenard's remains

49:22.926 --> 49:25.224
came in this large metal can.

49:26.530 --> 49:30.125
Inside this metal can
was a plastic bag,

49:30.233 --> 49:32.793
one for Timothy, and one for Amie.

49:32.903 --> 49:37.237
I mean, these are human beings.
And the question I ask is first of all:

49:37.341 --> 49:39.309
Who are you, Timothy?

49:39.409 --> 49:42.708
Who are you, Amie?
And what happened to you?

49:42.813 --> 49:47.341
In the case of Timothy and Amie,
what I had were body parts.

49:47.451 --> 49:50.852
Just the visual input of seeing

49:50.954 --> 49:54.355
a detached human being
before my eyes

49:54.458 --> 49:58.485
makes my heart race, makes
the hair stand up on the back of my head.

49:58.595 --> 50:02.292
Particularly in combination
with the contents of a tape,

50:02.399 --> 50:06.631
an audiotape that is the sound portion
of the videotape.

50:06.737 --> 50:09.604
And when I find out
from other investigators

50:09.706 --> 50:13.506
that the shoes neatly placed
at the entrance to a tent,

50:13.610 --> 50:16.408
and the cap left
on a camera so that

50:16.513 --> 50:19.505
the visual part
could not be recorded,

50:19.616 --> 50:24.553
yet the tape is running so that we can
hear the sounds of Amie screaming

50:24.654 --> 50:28.454
and the sounds
of Timothy moaning,

50:28.558 --> 50:31.391
tells me that this event
occurred very, very quickly,

50:31.495 --> 50:33.520
suddenly and unexpectedly.

50:33.630 --> 50:38.693
I clearly can hear her screaming,
"Stop" and "Go away."

50:38.802 --> 50:42.294
Maybe "Run away."
There's a lot of background noise.

50:42.406 --> 50:43.964
Timothy is moaning.

50:44.074 --> 50:49.410
And I hear Amie beating on the top
of this bear's head with a frying pan.

50:49.513 --> 50:53.711
And Timothy is saying,
"Run away. Let go!

50:53.817 --> 50:58.584
Run away. Run away, Amie.
Run away."

50:58.688 --> 51:01.885
Amie had a great deal
of conviction.

51:01.992 --> 51:06.326
She had a great deal of conviction
in this relationship. We know that.

51:06.430 --> 51:09.922
Although in the past,
she was more standoffish.

51:10.033 --> 51:13.696
She didn't get as close
to the bear as Timothy did.

51:13.804 --> 51:16.329
She was more cautious.

51:16.440 --> 51:19.898
However, I know,
that at the moment of death,

51:20.010 --> 51:25.209
when one is being tried
to the maximum of one's ability

51:25.315 --> 51:29.752
to be faithful,
to stick to a situation,

51:29.853 --> 51:32.981
to be loyal, if one can say that,
to Timothy,

51:33.090 --> 51:36.526
she stayed there,
and she fought with Timothy.

51:36.626 --> 51:38.685
She did not run away.

51:38.795 --> 51:43.129
Amie, we know, fought back
for approximately six minutes.

51:43.233 --> 51:48.261
Amie stayed with her lover,

51:48.371 --> 51:51.499
with her partner, with her mate,

51:51.608 --> 51:53.542
and with the bear.

51:53.643 --> 51:58.842
Ultimately she stayed
with the bear in the situation.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.532
<i>This is Timothy's camera</i>.

52:17.634 --> 52:19.431
<i>During the fatal attack,</i>

52:19.536 --> 52:22.733
<i>there was no time</i>
<i>to remove the lens cap</i>.

52:22.839 --> 52:26.866
<i>Jewel Palovak allowed me</i>
<i>to listen to the audio</i>.

52:31.548 --> 52:33.778
I hear rain, and I hear Amie,

52:33.884 --> 52:37.047
"Get away! Get away!
Go away!"

52:59.075 --> 53:01.100
Can you turn it off?

53:19.930 --> 53:22.490
Jewel, you must never
listen to this.

53:22.599 --> 53:26.865
I know, Werner.
I'm never going to.

53:26.970 --> 53:30.770
And you must never look at the photos
I've seen at the coroner's office.

53:30.874 --> 53:33.900
- I will never look at them.
- Yeah.

53:39.516 --> 53:42.485
They said it was bad.

53:45.188 --> 53:48.783
Now you know why
no one's gonna hear it.

53:53.663 --> 53:57.224
I think you, you should not keep it.
You should destroy it.

53:57.334 --> 54:00.462
- Yeah.
- I think that's what you should do.

54:00.570 --> 54:01.594
Okay.

54:01.705 --> 54:05.607
Because it will be the white elephant
in your room all your life.

57:05.388 --> 57:07.322
Here I am at the scene
of the fight.

57:07.424 --> 57:10.086
It looks as if tractors tore
the land up,

57:10.193 --> 57:12.388
raked it, rototilled it,
tossed it about.

57:12.495 --> 57:15.794
There is fur everywhere, and in the camera
foreground excreted waste.

57:15.899 --> 57:18.834
In the middle of the fight
so violent, so upsetting

57:18.935 --> 57:22.200
that Sergeant Brown
went to the bathroom,

57:22.305 --> 57:25.832
did a number two during his fight.

57:25.942 --> 57:29.537
Extremely emotional,
extremely powerful.

57:29.646 --> 57:32.513
And yet, both bears
back in pursuit of Saturn,

57:32.615 --> 57:36.608
including Mickey, who appears
to have gotten the worse for the wear

57:36.719 --> 57:39.847
in the fight between
Sergeant Brown and Mickey

57:39.956 --> 57:44.325
for the right to court Saturn,
the queen of the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Sanctuary.

57:44.427 --> 57:46.486
Ama <i>z</i> ing.

57:46.596 --> 57:49.588
Oh, Mickey, I love you. And Mickey's
now the closest bear to Saturn.

57:49.699 --> 57:53.157
Back in like a horse in a race
that does not give up.

57:53.269 --> 57:56.238
We love that bear. Mickey!
We love him! We love him.

57:56.339 --> 57:59.433
But, Mickey,
I've been down that street.

57:59.542 --> 58:01.806
You don't always get the chick you want.
Let me tell you.

58:01.911 --> 58:04.379
It doesn't always often work out.

58:04.481 --> 58:06.381
Hey, he's after my own heart.

58:06.483 --> 58:09.281
He don't give up,
even when it looks shitty.

58:09.385 --> 58:12.320
All right, love you, Mickey.
Love you, Mickey.

58:19.262 --> 58:22.459
I just wanna discuss that fight
with Mickey bear right here.

58:22.565 --> 58:24.931
He's right next to me here
in the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Sanctuary on the tide fly.

58:25.034 --> 58:27.229
Saturn off to camera left.

58:27.337 --> 58:32.502
Mick, you underestimated Sergeant Brown.
You went in for the head.

58:32.609 --> 58:35.305
He seemed to be rope-a-doping you
like he wasn't that tough.

58:35.411 --> 58:38.107
And then once you
banged into him,

58:38.214 --> 58:41.411
man, he turned out to be
one heck of a rough bear,

58:41.518 --> 58:43.213
a very rough bear.

58:43.319 --> 58:47.016
I was so scared, I almost got sick
to my stomach watching you fight.

58:47.123 --> 58:49.921
Then when he knocked you down
and you were down on your back,

58:50.026 --> 58:53.325
it was terrible,
it was terrible!

58:53.429 --> 58:55.693
I'm not duking it out for any girl like that.
I'm telling you right now.

58:55.798 --> 58:58.892
I'm not duking it out
for any girl, but l...

58:59.002 --> 59:01.493
Well, I've had my troubles
with the girls. Yeah, yeah.

59:01.604 --> 59:04.198
And I'll tell you something.
If Saturn was a female human...

59:04.307 --> 59:07.401
I can just see how beautiful
she is as a bear.

59:07.510 --> 59:11.344
I've always called her the Michelle Pfeiffer
of bears out here.

59:13.082 --> 59:15.448
All right, you lay there.
I'm gonna go off with your girlfriend.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.452
Don't beat me up over it.

59:17.554 --> 59:20.614
I'm cool, I'm cool. I'm respectful.

59:20.723 --> 59:22.953
Things are bad for me
with the human women,

59:23.059 --> 59:25.254
but not so bad that I have
to be hitting on bears yet.

59:25.361 --> 59:27.454
Okay? Okay.

59:30.767 --> 59:32.394
<i>In his diaries,</i>

59:32.502 --> 59:37.064
<i>Treadwell speaks often of the human world</i>
<i>as something foreign</i>.

59:37.173 --> 59:41.269
<i>He made a clear distinction between</i>
<i>the bears and the people's world</i>

59:41.377 --> 59:44.710
<i>which moved further and further</i>
<i>into the distance</i>.

59:46.549 --> 59:51.486
<i>Wild, primordial nature was</i>
<i>where he felt truly at home</i>.

59:55.792 --> 01:00:00.957
<i>We explored the glacier in the back country</i>
<i>of his Grizzly Sanctuary</i>.

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:05.228
<i>This gigantic complexity</i>
<i>of tumbling ice and abysses</i>

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:08.668
<i>separated Treadwell</i>
<i>from the world out there</i>.

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:13.470
<i>And more so, it seems to me</i>
<i>that this landscape in turmoil</i>

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:16.067
<i>is a metaphor of his soul</i>.

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:31.225
<i>Off there in the distance</i>
<i>is his bay and his campsite</i>

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:33.727
<i>where he battled his demons</i>.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:38.832
<i>What drove Timothy</i>
<i>into the wild?</i>

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:42.401
<i>We visited his parents</i>
<i>in Florida</i>.

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:48.035
<i>Timothy grew up with</i>
<i>four siblings in Long Island</i>

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:50.203
<i>in a solid middle-class family</i>

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:54.010
<i>where the father worked as the foreman</i>
<i>of a construction team</i>

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.847
<i>for a telephone company</i>.

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:59.421
<i>There must have been</i>
<i>an urge to escape</i>

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:03.856
<i>the safety of</i>
<i>his protected environment</i>.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.294
<i>I was moved to find that among</i>
<i>all memorabilia in the house,</i>

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:11.799
<i>his mother was clutching</i>
<i>Timothy's favorite bear</i>.

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:15.462
This has been to Alaska
many times.

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:18.301
I'm sure he loved it
to the end, you know?

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:22.344
It's just... his childhood toy.

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:27.041
<i>Tim's childhood pointed towards</i>
<i>nothing extraordinary</i>.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:29.641
A normal everyday kid.

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:34.052
Never any trouble in school.
Always a good student.

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.489
Not an "A" student,
a "B" student.

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:41.029
And got along great
with kids and animals.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:44.190
<i>Him and I were extremely connected</i>
<i>to animals in the house</i>.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.996
<i>I think more so</i>
<i>than anybody else</i>.

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.702
<i>This squirrel named Willie</i>

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:53.708
<i>became Timothy's best friend</i>.

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.938
<i>Teddy bears meant a lot to him</i>.

01:01:57.046 --> 01:02:02.279
<i>He seemed to develop into</i>
<i>an all-American boy, handsome,</i>

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:05.581
<i>athletic, full of promise</i>.

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:11.220
<i>He excelled on</i>
<i>his high school swim team</i>.

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:16.287
<i>He went to Bradley University</i>
<i>on a diving scholarship</i>.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:20.130
I think he started drinking
out there and having,

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:22.568
you know, just hanging out
with the wrong people.

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:25.140
Then he injured his back.
And he ended up

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:28.836
losing his scholarship
and coming back home.

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:32.312
He did attempt to smoke
marijuana in the house.

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.406
Yeah, he did.

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.280
But I put the kibosh on that.

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:39.047
But obviously he was
doing it elsewhere, so...

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:43.091
He really wanted a new start,
a fresh start.

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:47.492
So when he went out to California,
he was 19 or 20.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:51.863
He wasn't a young 15 or 16-year-old.
He was of age.

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:57.235
He'd gotten a job just to make money
on the Queen Mary at the gift shop.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:00.070
He did hire an agent.

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:05.478
He did change his name
to Treadwell to be theatrical.

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:08.175
And it was a family name.

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.279
I know he got on

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.482
<i>Love Connection</i>
<i>with Chuck Woolery</i>.

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:18.992
I think he got on another show.

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:22.428
There were promises made
that never came true.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:25.023
And he tested with the actors

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:28.797
to get the bartender job
on <i>Cheers</i>.

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:33.433
And allegedly he came in second
to Woody Harrelson.

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:36.137
How close a second?
I don't know.

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:39.214
But that is what
really destroyed him.

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:42.910
That he did not get
that job on <i>Cheers</i>.

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:47.419
He spiraled down.

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:53.925
Timmy used to body surf out here.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:58.467
He had a boogie board
with the Union Jack on it.

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:02.436
And he was totally fearless.

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:05.735
The ama <i>z</i> ing thing about Timmy
was he did...

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.402
He had this Prince Valiant haircut.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:12.311
And he could surf
and go under water,

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:16.784
and yet still that hair would hide
his receding hairline.

01:04:16.886 --> 01:04:19.150
It was the most
ama <i>z</i> ing thing I'd ever seen.

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.416
No matter how rough the surf,

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.685
you never saw Timmy's forehead.

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:25.852
I don't know how he did that.

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.159
How's the hair look?

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:32.759
<i>At some point in Timmy's life,</i>

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.463
he had a near fatal overdose.

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:38.472
How he survived it,
I don't know.

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:40.565
He was a tough guy.

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:42.940
But I guess it was
an epiphany for him.

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:47.539
After that he was looking
for a different persona.

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:52.554
I guess that's when
he came up with

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:56.091
where he was from
and his delightful accent.

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.921
<i>I never questioned it</i>.

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:02.125
<i>Treadwell's need to invent</i>
<i>a new persona for himself</i>

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:04.995
<i>led him to elaborate</i>
<i>fabrications</i>.

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:07.797
<i>He claimed to be an orphan</i>
<i>from Australia,</i>

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:12.136
<i>and even checked out details</i>
<i>of a small town in the Australian outback</i>

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:15.074
<i>in order to sound convincing</i>.

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:18.669
<i>His accent, though,</i>
<i>remained suspicious</i>.

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:22.512
<i>It almost sounded more Kennedy-esque</i>
<i>than Australian</i>.

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:25.348
After Timmy's death,

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:30.858
people said, "Well, don't you feel
betrayed that he did that?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.760
That he didn't tell you the truth
about his accent or his origins?"

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:37.932
And that never bothered me.

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:40.366
Timmy always amused me.

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.403
There's an old saying
on the farm,

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:45.633
"If it doesn't scare the cows,
who cares?"

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:49.006
Well, I don't think
Timmy ever scared the cows,

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:51.102
so who cares?

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:54.944
He was troubled.
I mean, it...

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:59.344
One time he went to a doctor.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:02.947
They wanted to put him on some kind
of an antidepressant or something

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:06.961
to keep his mood, 'cause his moods
were so up and down.

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:10.999
And he started taking it for a while,
and then he stopped.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.159
He said, "I had to stop."
I said, "Why?"

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:18.138
He said, "Because I can't stop.
I can't have the middle grounds.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.470
I have to have the highs
and the lows.

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.976
It's a part of my life,
it's a part of my personality."

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:25.343
He definitely had a dark side.

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:30.647
He was mixed up in drugs which makes you
mixed up in bad people, people with guns.

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:35.315
Timothy always had a sense of justice
that was his own.

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:39.622
So he got into a lot,
a lot of trouble.

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.629
I think that...

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:43.631
How dangerous?

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.530
How dangerous? I mean...

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:50.266
I don't think he would've ever...
He couldn't have ever killed anybody.

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:53.399
He always kept it in check. One thing
that we did every once in a while

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:56.569
which just seems so bi <i>z</i> arre
by now, but it's...

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:59.375
We would go, when we lived in the Valley,
to the Van Nuys courthouse.

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:02.918
We would watch when criminals
were being sentenced.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.783
We would watch people
getting their sentence.

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:09.517
And I think we did it...
I did it just for shock value,

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.616
and because it was something
I had never done.

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:15.322
But he did it, I think,
to remind him

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:19.891
if he went to that dark place,
what his life would be.

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:24.038
I'm in love
with my animal friends.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:27.507
I'm in love with my animal friends!
In love with my animal friends.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.044
I'm very, very troubled.

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.286
It's very emotional.

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:42.250
It's probably not cool
even looking like this.

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:47.489
I'm so in love with them, and they're
so f-ed over, which so sucks.

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:52.495
Do you know you're the star
for all the children.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:58.272
They love you. And I love you so much,
and thank you.

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:03.404
Thank you for being my friend.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.084
Isn't this... so sad?

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:18.388
This is a bumblebee

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:22.260
who expired as it was working

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:26.095
at doing the pollen thing
on this Alaskan fireweed.

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:31.139
And it just is... Just has
really touched me to no end.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.700
It was doing its duty,
it was flying around.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:41.408
Working busy as a bee,
and it died right there.

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:44.452
It's beautiful, it's sad,
it's tragic.

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.747
I love that bee.

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.585
Well, the bee moved.

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.421
Was it sleeping?

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:14.247
There's your poop.

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.812
It just came out of her butt.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.718
I can feel it.

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:25.792
I can feel the poop.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.886
It's warm.
It just came from her butt.

01:09:29.965 --> 01:09:31.956
This was just inside of her.

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:34.228
My girl.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.236
I'm touching it.

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.169
It's her poop.
It's Wendy's poop.

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:43.974
I know it may seem weird that I touched
her poop, but it was inside of her.

01:09:44.078 --> 01:09:47.139
It's what... It's her life!

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:49.444
It's her! And she's
so precious to me.

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:53.113
She gave me Downey.
Downey's... I adore Downey.

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:57.186
Everything about them is perfect.

01:09:57.293 --> 01:10:00.228
<i>Perfection belonged to the bears</i>.

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:03.162
<i>But once in a while,</i>
<i>Treadwell came face-to-face</i>

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:06.393
<i>with the harsh reality</i>
<i>of wild nature</i>.

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:09.471
<i>This did not fit into</i>
<i>his sentimentalized view</i>

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:11.699
<i>that everything out there</i>
<i>was good,</i>

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:15.743
<i>and the universe in balance</i>
<i>and in harmony</i>.

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:21.077
<i>Male bears sometimes kill cubs to stop</i>
<i>the females from lactating,</i>

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:24.949
<i>and thus have them ready again</i>
<i>for fornication</i>.

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:38.499
Oh, God!

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.699
I love you.

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:45.936
I love you and I

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.909
don't understand.

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.244
It's a painful world.

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:55.340
<i>Here I differ with Treadwell</i>.

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:59.649
<i>He seemed to ignore the fact that</i>
<i>in nature there are predators</i>.

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:03.919
<i>I believe the common denominator</i>
<i>of the universe is not harmony,</i>

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:07.792
<i>but chaos, hostility and murder</i>.

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:09.796
He wandered too far
from the den.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:12.924
And the wolves last night
that I heard howling,

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:16.061
screeching in glee
and excitement,

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:20.164
it was over the termination
of one of the babies.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:23.404
This Expedition 2001
has taken a sad turn,

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:25.446
but it is a real turn.

01:11:25.547 --> 01:11:29.711
And I mourn the death
of this gorgeous baby fox.

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:31.786
Good-bye, little fox.

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:38.121
Get out of his eye,
you friggin' fly!

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:41.958
Don't do it when I'm around.
Have some respect, you fucker.

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:44.425
<i>Most disturbing for him</i>

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:47.502
<i>was to find the skull</i>
<i>of a young bear</i>.

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:50.868
<i>In the summer of 2000</i>
<i>came an extended drought</i>.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:55.000
<i>The creek was so low that for weeks</i>
<i>there was no salmon run,</i>

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:57.704
<i>and starving bears</i>
<i>simply ate their own</i>.

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:05.217
It has been only five, not even six days
since the baby died.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:09.052
And this is all that's left
of the little tyke.

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:11.558
That's it!
There's nothing else left.

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.128
They've eaten everything.

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:20.362
It's so sad.
She was so cute.

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:25.504
Five days and all
that's left is a skull.

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:30.476
<i>This called for desperate measures</i>.

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:35.107
There are fish lining up
about to try to make a run.

01:12:35.217 --> 01:12:39.210
And now they have a good reason for going
because I have built them a corridor.

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:42.779
Let's have a look at it.
What I have done is... Have a look.

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:48.124
I've constructed a runway for them,
a navigational trail.

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:51.165
<i>When interference with nature</i>
<i>was not enough,</i>

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:54.258
<i>he had to invoke higher powers</i>.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:58.238
Oh, live TV.
Live on tape.

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:02.367
Okay, so here's the deal.
Pull this down a little bit.

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:06.546
It's September 20.

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:09.549
It's the year 2000.
It's Expedition 2000.

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:12.381
There has not been a substantial rainfall
for almost two months.

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:16.185
The fish have not run since
about August 2, August 3.

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:20.057
We are now getting our first rain,
but it has just slowed down.

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:23.757
We need at least 2 inches,
I think even 3 inches of rain.

01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:27.358
In the last two hours, we're up
a little over.20 inches of rain.

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:32.304
That is not enough. We're gonna
need more rain. We need more rain!

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:35.639
Downey is hungry!
Tabitha's hungry!

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:38.212
Melissa is eating her babies.

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:43.642
I'm like a fucking nut.
We've got to have some rain.

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:46.312
I'm not a religious guy. No.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:50.654
But I'm telling ya,
I'm just pissed because...

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:54.425
It just doesn't seem right.
It just doesn't seem right.

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:57.397
I know it's just weather
and crap like that, and it's...

01:13:57.499 --> 01:13:59.729
I don't know what
the variables are.

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:02.167
But we've gotta have
some goddamn rain!

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:05.832
So if there's a God,
Downey needs to eat!

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.841
Dump on us. Hurt us!

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.376
Come on!

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.383
Think rain.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.918
Think rain.

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:24.789
Just a crappy little shower right now.
What kind of crappy... Come on!

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.485
Take this again.

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:29.689
Does not make me
very, very happy.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:34.963
I want rain. I want, if there's a God,
to kick some ass down here.

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.970
Let's have some water!

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:39.802
Jesus, boy!
Let's have some water!

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:42.308
Christ man or Allah

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:46.211
or Hindu floaty thing,

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:50.251
let's have some fucking water
for these animals!

01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:04.161
It is now September 21, Thursday
of the year 2000. Expedition 2000.

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:06.234
I am the Lord's humble servant.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.566
I am Allah's disciple.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:14.131
I am the floaty thing's go-for boy.

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:17.804
There has been a miracle here.
There has been an absolute miracle.

01:15:17.913 --> 01:15:21.872
It has rained 1.65 inches
of rain today.

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:25.920
We have over 2 inches now in the storm,
and it is not stopping.

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:28.012
It may hit 3 inches of rain.

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:31.854
It went from a trickle to a flood.
And it's ama <i>z</i> ing.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.121
And we have a really,
really great chance

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:37.562
of a run of fish for the animals.

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:40.635
And what is even more miraculous,

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:44.297
according to my radio,
it is not raining much

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.567
around anywhere else
but around here.

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.537
Oops.

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:59.810
Well, it's now after 2:00
on October 4.

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:02.516
And the tent has caved in
due to the storm.

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:05.286
I'm still here with my little teddy bear,
Tabitha bear.

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:08.454
And I think the storm's actually
gotten a little weaker, but

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:12.762
in the course of it getting stronger,
it crushed the wall in and bent the poles.

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:15.803
And you really can't do much about it
because once they get like that,

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:20.364
they just stay kind of bent in
and you're screwed and all that.

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.970
This is my life.
This is what I do.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.571
And l... I love it. I love it.

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.446
Even this, I love it.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:34.645
My tent crushed in. I love it.
It's pathetic, but I love it.

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:37.452
<i>Hello, hello, hello</i>

01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:42.959
Are you scared, little bear?

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:45.295
The storm's gonna go on
and on and on.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.665
It doesn't look like I may get outta here
for another week or so.

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:55.807
Oh, look at this. I put my tripod
up to shore up the tent.

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:59.074
I put a pole up there, so now I got a tent.
That's a pretty good idea, huh?

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:01.706
Aha! Pretty good for me.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:18.365
We have about 35,000 brown
gri <i>zz</i> ly bears here in Alaska.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:22.631
What we can tell, it's a very healthy population,
it's a stable population.

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:25.730
Of course, you have to be careful with bears
because they have unique needs,

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:27.775
especially the gri <i>zz</i> ly bear.

01:17:27.876 --> 01:17:31.312
They need large areas.
They have low reproductive rates.

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:34.075
You have to be cautious in the way
you utili <i>z</i> e those animals.

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:36.082
Bear hunting, as an example,

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:38.550
is a very important aspect
of the economy.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:41.817
$4,500,000 a year
is spent on bear hunts.

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:45.882
Here on Kodiak Island
we have about 3,000 bears.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:49.054
Each year we harvest
about 160 of those.

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:53.760
Through our research, we found that you can
harvest about 6% of the population annually

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:56.497
and still have
a healthy group of bears.

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:59.336
And poaching?

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:01.875
Poaching is not as big
a concern around here

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:06.209
as it has been in Russia, for instance,
and some other locations.

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:08.544
There is some poaching
that occurs for gall bladders

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.709
or some bears that
are just killed wantonly

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:13.879
because people don't like them
or they're afraid of them.

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:17.390
But for the most part, here on Kodiak
and on the Alaska peninsula,

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:20.484
it is a very rare occurrence
in the last 20 years.

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:23.598
<i>Despite the statistics,</i>

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:26.099
<i>Treadwell became</i>
<i>increasingly paranoid</i>

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.931
<i>about his enemy, the poacher</i>.

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:32.200
And it's gotten to be September,
near October.

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:34.502
It's the time of year
where poachers can come around.

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:37.669
It's time for me to go in my guerrilla-style
camouflage outfit.

01:18:37.779 --> 01:18:41.112
Downey still recogni <i>z</i> es me
by talking to her. Don't you?

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:44.447
Yeah, I'm the big cra <i>z</i> y guy with the...
or the skinny cra <i>z</i> y guy

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.784
with the camouflage makeup on.

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:56.696
They're armed with pepper spray
and rocks.

01:18:56.798 --> 01:18:59.892
<i>In all his video recordings</i>
<i>over the years,</i>

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:04.199
<i>this is Treadwell's closest</i>
<i>encounter with intruders</i>.

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:07.275
I believe the guide is the person
with the camera.

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:11.209
The big camera on the tripod.
There we go. Got a nice close-up of him.

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:14.976
He's the one who threw the rock
at Freckles, the bear.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:18.746
It's Quincy.

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:20.845
They're throwing rocks at him.

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:23.891
They're throwing rocks
at my Quincy.

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:26.460
They're gonna stone him,
and then they're gonna photograph him.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.532
Oh, that's it!

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:38.663
That's enough of this.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.607
That's... I can... They hit Quincy.

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:48.311
I don't wanna expose myself
to them.

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:52.682
I'm submitting this
as Sunday, August 1.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:58.055
It is 4:35 and 18 seconds
on this day.

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.456
It's hard to say,
but it's a warning of a sort.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:05.556
And it's obviously here
to upset me.

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:11.769
"Hi, Timothy.
See you in summer of 2001."

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:14.273
Now it doesn't say, "Hi, Timothy.
We're gonna fucking kill you."

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:17.903
It doesn't say, "Hi, Timothy. You're fucking
dead. We're gonna chop your legs off.

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:20.140
Hey, Timothy,
get the fuck out."

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:23.445
It just says, "See you
in the summer of 2001."

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:25.486
But it is some sort
of a warning.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:27.919
It is some sort of a ha-ha.

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:29.991
I don't think it's friendly.

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:34.152
Well, it's gotten
a little worse here.

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:37.356
The warning, "Hi, Timothy.
See you summer of 2001."

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:41.765
Now I find this big stack of rocks that were,
you know, put some labor here.

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:46.807
We're not calling this
the building of the pyramids.

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:49.570
But we are saying
there's a bit of trouble.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.841
Now, I'm gonna walk back,
I'm gonna bring you back here.

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:59.147
Through my camp.
Let's come through here. Pathway.

01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:01.188
Here's where...

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:05.089
Here's where the sign was, here.
Which is where my tent is.

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:08.651
And then we go over where
my bear-proof barrels would be.

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:12.961
And we find boulders piled up...

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:15.093
Boulders piled up

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:20.072
and a happy face indelibly
painted into the rock,

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:22.200
like looking at me.

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:27.914
Very, very frickin' frightening, huh?

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:29.984
Whoever put it there,

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:36.016
knew what they were doing.

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:37.785
It's a warning.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:42.592
And the thing is, it's better
than a warning, than...

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:45.325
It's better than like,
"You're fucking dead" type of thing.

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:47.993
It's creepy, baby!
It's creepy.

01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:50.071
It's Freddy Krueger creepy.

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.735
<i>There were visitors</i>
<i>every now and then</i>.

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:57.869
<i>But for Treadwell,</i>
<i>they were just intruders</i>.

01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:02.507
<i>An encroaching threat upon what</i>
<i>he considered his Eden</i>.

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:08.012
<i>Even the Park Service itself</i>
<i>became an enemy</i>

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:10.557
<i>because of its restrictions</i>.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:15.124
I have decided to violate
a federal rule

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:18.256
which states
I must camp one mile...

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:22.427
Every week I must move one mile after
staying for seven consecutive days.

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:24.437
If I was to do that,

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:27.406
I would not be able to study these bears,
not be able to protect them.

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:31.036
I'd have to move out of the bay
to get a mile out.

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:35.549
Therefore I have decided to protest
the United States government

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:38.380
and guard these bears anyway
and stay, and I have...

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:43.287
<i>In order to get around the rule of not</i>
<i>camping permanently in one spot,</i>

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:47.919
<i>he would camouflage and hide</i>
<i>his tent from the Park Service</i>.

01:22:48.029 --> 01:22:51.328
<i>But more than that,</i>
<i>he was in constant violation</i>

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:54.231
<i>of another very reasonable</i>
<i>park rule:</i>

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:59.672
<i>That you have to maintain at least 100 yards</i>
<i>distance from the bears</i>.

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:01.605
Ding.

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:06.038
Hi. Go back to your friend.
Go back to your friend.

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:09.613
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:11.845
It's okay.

01:23:11.953 --> 01:23:15.081
You're awfully close.
You're awfully close.

01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:17.590
Hi. Oh, hi, there!

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:21.492
<i>The park restrictions made him</i>
<i>increasingly irate</i>.

01:23:25.934 --> 01:23:29.665
Well, we're into autumn now.
Expedition 2001 coming to an end.

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:32.205
The bears moving safely
towards their winter dens.

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:34.241
The foxes hiding in the woods,

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:37.175
safe from the humans
that would come to harm them.

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:39.974
It's been an ama <i>z</i> ing season.
It's been difficult.

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:44.074
But I came, I served,
I protected and I studied.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:46.619
And I promise, I'll be back.

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:58.992
My hair.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:03.594
Expedition 2001 coming to an end for
Gri <i>zz</i> ly People, for me, Timothy Treadwell.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.196
I came here and protected
the animals as best I could.

01:24:06.307 --> 01:24:09.504
In fact, I'm the only protection
for these animals out here.

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:13.012
The government flying over a total
of two times in two months.

01:24:13.114 --> 01:24:16.106
How dare they!
How dare they challenge me!

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:18.777
How dare they smear me
with their campaigns!

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.583
How dare they, when they do not
look after these animals,

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:24.180
and I come here in peace
and in love,

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:26.624
neutral in respect.

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:30.263
I will continue to do this.
I will fight them.

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:32.799
I will be an American dissident
if I need be.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.869
There's a patriotic time
going on right now,

01:24:34.969 --> 01:24:36.994
but as far as this
fucking government's concerned,

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:39.471
fuck you,
motherfucking Park Service!

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:42.372
<i>Now Treadwell crosses a line</i>
<i>with the Park Service</i>

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:44.775
<i>which we will not cross</i>.

01:24:44.879 --> 01:24:50.112
<i>He attacks the individuals with</i>
<i>whom he worked for 13 years</i>.

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:52.914
I beat your fucking asses!
I protected the animals!

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:55.649
I did it! Fuck you!

01:24:56.825 --> 01:24:59.919
Animals rule.
Timothy conquered.

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:02.622
Fuck you, Park Service!

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.856
Okay.

01:25:05.967 --> 01:25:08.834
<i>It is clear to me that the Park Service</i>

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:12.373
<i>is not Treadwell's real enemy</i>.

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:16.205
<i>There's a larger, more</i>
<i>implacable adversary out there:</i>

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:19.178
<i>The people's world</i>
<i>and civilization</i>.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:22.181
"Oh, Timothy, I'm getting
a bad feeling about you."

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:25.616
<i>He only has mockery</i>
<i>and contempt for it</i>.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.622
"I saw you on <i>David Letterman</i>.
You're fairly entertaining."

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:34.218
<i>His rage is almost</i>
<i>incandescent, artistic</i>.

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:38.527
<i>The actor in his film has</i>
<i>taken over from the filmmaker</i>.

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:42.364
<i>I have seen this madness</i>
<i>before on a film set</i>.

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:47.533
<i>But Treadwell is not an actor in opposition</i>
<i>to a director or a producer</i>.

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:51.601
<i>He's fighting civilization itself</i>.

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:55.945
<i>It is the same civilization</i>
<i>that cast Thoreau out of Walden</i>

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:58.814
<i>and John Muir into the wild</i>.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.581
Animals rule.

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:05.518
All right.
That's my happy stuff.

01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:07.822
Let's do a couple
of nice takes now.

01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:10.295
Oh, man, did I get angry!
Fuck them, right?

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:12.662
They do not watch these animals.
They don't care about these animals.

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:16.066
All they wanna do
is screw people like me around.

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:18.503
It's ama <i>z</i> ing. "Let the fishermen
fucking shoot the animals.

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.437
Let the fucking poachers
come in here and fuck 'em.

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:22.442
Let the fucking commercial
people fuck them around

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:25.138
with their fucking cameras
and the tourists.

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:27.077
But we're gonna go screw
with Timothy Treadwell

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:29.912
because he loves animals
and teaches kids for free.

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.713
Let's go. Let's do that.
That's what we're gonna do."

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:35.186
Well, fuck them. Fuck them.
I beat you, motherfuckers. I beat you.

01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:37.190
Beat ya, so fuck you.

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:39.852
I beat ya. I beat ya.

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:41.519
I'm the champion.
I'm the fucking champion.

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:44.757
I beat you.
I beat your fucking asses.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:48.597
Fucking losers!
Fucking nobodies!

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:50.568
Fuck!

01:26:50.672 --> 01:26:53.664
Fucking fucks!

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:57.745
Well, Expedition 2001
coming to an end.

01:26:57.845 --> 01:27:01.611
The bears safely moving into their winter dens,
the foxes hiding in the woods.

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:05.482
I came here. I studied them,
protected them.

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:11.355
And I promise you, I promise the
Gri <i>zz</i> ly People, I will be back. I will be back.

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:15.589
And I thank the animals for keeping
me safe and for inspiring me.

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.995
I thank them so very much.

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:21.101
Good-bye.

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:25.401
This is my favorite.

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:27.440
This is my cowboy.

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:30.170
Always in black.
Always sunglasses.

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:32.303
And always a bandanna.

01:27:33.948 --> 01:27:36.542
I miss you terribly.

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:40.480
He was very dear to my heart.

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:42.783
Very dear to my heart.

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:48.719
My heart hurts every day
for him.

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.661
He was a good friend.

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:56.028
I've known him 13 years.

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:58.105
And he just was a good friend.

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:00.970
He was a distant friend
in the winter

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:03.202
and a close friend
in the summer.

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:07.372
And... I helped him do
quite a few things here.

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:10.247
He'd always come back.

01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:13.115
And I was kind of
his confidante here.

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:16.789
But I miss him.

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:21.055
I miss his... rambunctious personality

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:23.790
and his outgoing... his heart,

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:26.992
you know, just everything
about him, I think.

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:30.271
<i>Kathleen Parker still holds</i>

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:33.169
<i>some of</i>
<i>Timothy Treadwell's ashes</i>.

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:37.506
<i>She insists that she was</i>
<i>a platonic friend only</i>.

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:41.605
<i>She stored his gear in her basement</i>
<i>during the winters</i>.

01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:45.584
<i>He would set out into</i>
<i>the wilderness from her house</i>.

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:49.919
When he would leave,
he would say at my back door,

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:51.992
he says, "I love you."

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:56.120
He says, "This is going to be
the best year of my life out there."

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:59.324
And he says,
"If I don't come back,

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:03.029
it's what I want,
this is the way I wanna go."

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:10.109
His last camp was just right
in the right-hand edge of this slope.

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:12.304
Patch of trees here.

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:19.546
Right down here in this...
very end of these trees here.

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:40.774
This is his ashes.

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:43.571
Some of them for me to spread.

01:29:43.678 --> 01:29:47.739
And some bear hair, fur.

01:29:47.849 --> 01:29:51.444
And some weeds.
And what else is in there?

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:54.885
There's a little bit of lupin,
there's a little bit of iris.

01:29:54.989 --> 01:29:58.755
- There's, I think...
- Where did you get the bear fur?

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.556
- We picked it up off the ground.
- Cool. Cool.

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:03.527
Where are we?

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:06.998
We are at a campsite
where Timothy last camped.

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:12.368
Not where he was killed.
But over here in Hallo Bay.

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:15.533
And, Willie, you can...
'cause you brought him over here.

01:30:15.643 --> 01:30:19.170
His last campsite was right here
in the trees here.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.010
<i>He camped there because</i>
<i>he was right between two fox dens</i>.

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:23.947
<i>I'd been in the camp there</i>.

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:29.387
<i>The fox would come right to the edge</i>
<i>of the tent, and go in their dens</i>.

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:33.824
<i>So I think that's probably the main reason</i>
<i>he camped right there</i>.

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:37.359
<i>Okay, Timothy</i>.

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.858
I love you.

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:46.063
And rest peacefully.

01:30:49.377 --> 01:30:51.777
Rest peacefully, my love.

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:57.843
Finally figured a way out
to live here forever.

01:30:57.952 --> 01:30:59.579
He's here forever.

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.552
<i>This is Timothy Treadwell's</i>
<i>and Amie Huguenard's route</i>

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:11.461
<i>to the site of their death</i>.

01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:15.002
<i>There was a certain absurdity</i>
<i>in their end</i>.

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:19.163
<i>As usual, the expedition was over</i>
<i>by the end of September,</i>

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:24.074
<i>and both had returned to Kodiak</i>
<i>on their way back to California</i>.

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:28.472
<i>Treadwell writes in his diary</i>
<i>that at the airport</i>

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:32.075
<i>he had an altercation</i>
<i>with an obese airline agent</i>

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:35.178
<i>over the validity of his ticket</i>.

01:31:35.289 --> 01:31:38.520
<i>"How much I hate</i>
<i>the people's world, " he writes</i>.

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.821
<i>And disgusted,</i>
<i>he decides right then</i>

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:44.261
<i>to return to this spot</i>
<i>and his bears</i>.

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:50.467
<i>Once back in the Grizzly Maze,</i>
<i>Amie had mixed feelings</i>.

01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:52.562
<i>She was afraid of the bears</i>

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:55.506
<i>and had a deadline to return</i>
<i>for a new job</i>

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:59.444
<i>and spoke openly</i>
<i>about leaving him for good</i>.

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:03.608
<i>According to one of the last entries</i>
<i>in Treadwell's diary,</i>

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:08.246
<i>Amie called him hell-bent</i>
<i>on destruction</i>.

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:13.419
<i>And yet, inexplicably, she remained</i>
<i>with him here in the Maze</i>.

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:24.197
<i>Normally Treadwell would not</i>
<i>be here this late in the year</i>.

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:26.705
<i>And upon their return,</i>

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:31.141
<i>he discovered that many of his bear friends</i>
<i>had gone into hibernation</i>.

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:34.442
<i>And scary,</i>
<i>unknown and wilder bears</i>

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.949
<i>from the interior had moved in</i>.

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:43.351
<i>This is the spot where</i>
<i>they set up their last camp</i>.

01:32:52.633 --> 01:32:54.567
Let me tell you.

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:59.663
Honestly, camping in gri <i>zz</i> ly country
is dangerous.

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:02.572
People who camp in gri <i>zz</i> ly country
should camp out in the open

01:33:02.677 --> 01:33:05.339
to let the bears know
where the tent is.

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:07.414
My camp is unseen.

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:10.882
It is the most dangerous camping,
the most dangerous living

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:13.749
in the history of the world
by any human being.

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:18.587
I have lived longer with wild brown
gri <i>zz</i> ly bears, without weapons,

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:21.093
and that's the key, without weapons,
in modern history

01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:24.995
than any human on earth,
any human.

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:26.999
And I have remained safe.

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:31.470
But every second of every day that I move
through this jungle, or even at the tent,

01:33:31.572 --> 01:33:36.737
I am right on the precipice
of great bodily harm or even death.

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.978
And I am so thankful
for every minute of every day

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:44.017
that I found the bears

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:46.313
and this place,
the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Ma <i>z</i> e.

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:53.723
But let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:57.457
There is no, no, no
other place in the world

01:33:57.565 --> 01:34:01.797
that is more dangerous, more exciting
than the Gri <i>zz</i> ly Ma <i>z</i> e.

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:04.336
Come here and camp here.
Come here and try to do what I do.

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:07.032
You will die.
You will die here.

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:10.372
You will frickin' die here.
They will get you.

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:13.845
I found a way. I found a way
to survive with them.

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:16.348
Am I a great person?
I don't know. I don't know.

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:20.147
We're all great people. Everyone has
something in them that's wonderful.

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:25.453
I'm just different. And I love these bears
enough to do it right.

01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:29.723
And I'm edgy enough
and I'm tough enough.

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:35.132
But mostly I love these bears enough
to survive and do it right.

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:37.170
And I'm never giving this up.
Never giving it up.

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:40.434
Never giving up the Ma <i>z</i> e.
Never.

01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:43.101
This is it.
This is my life.

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:45.405
This is my land.

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:55.149
<i>Very late in the process</i>
<i>of editing this film,</i>

01:34:55.256 --> 01:34:59.022
<i>we were given access</i>
<i>to Treadwell's last videotape</i>.

01:35:00.227 --> 01:35:03.594
<i>Here he may have filmed</i>
<i>his murderer</i>.

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:09.129
<i>The killer bear we know</i>
<i>was a male</i>

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:13.332
<i>whom years earlier</i>
<i>the Park Service had anesthetized</i>.

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:16.035
<i>They extracted a tooth</i>
<i>which established him</i>

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:19.374
<i>as being 28</i>
<i>at the time of the attack</i>.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.880
<i>Quite old for a bear</i>.

01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:26.419
<i>They also tagged him</i>
<i>via a tattoo on his inner lip</i>.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:30.547
<i>They had given him</i>
<i>a number only, 141</i>.

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:34.685
<i>Bear 141</i>.
<i>That's all we know of him</i>.

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:43.125
<i>And here</i>.
<i>Could this one be Bear 141?</i>

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:51.502
<i>What looks playful</i>
<i>could be desperation</i>.

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:55.013
<i>So late in the season,</i>
<i>the bear is diving deep</i>

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:58.142
<i>for one of the few</i>
<i>remaining salmon carcasses</i>

01:35:58.252 --> 01:36:00.516
<i>at the bottom of the lake</i>.

01:36:20.341 --> 01:36:24.835
<i>Treadwell keeps filming the bear</i>
<i>with a strange persistence</i>.

01:36:28.516 --> 01:36:31.110
<i>And all of a sudden, this</i>.

01:36:33.754 --> 01:36:37.190
<i>Is Amie trying</i>
<i>to get out of the shot?</i>

01:36:39.026 --> 01:36:43.827
<i>Did Treadwell wait till his last tape</i>
<i>to put her in his film?</i>

01:36:49.069 --> 01:36:51.867
<i>And what haunts me,</i>
<i>is that in all the faces</i>

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:55.066
<i>of all the bears</i>
<i>that Treadwell ever filmed,</i>

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:59.408
<i>I discover no kinship,</i>
<i>no understanding, no mercy</i>.

01:36:59.513 --> 01:37:04.951
<i>I see only the overwhelming</i>
<i>indifference of nature</i>.

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:09.955
<i>To me, there is no such thing</i>
<i>as a secret world of the bears</i>.

01:37:10.057 --> 01:37:15.586
<i>And this blank stare speaks</i>
<i>only of a half-bored interest in food</i>.

01:37:15.696 --> 01:37:20.998
<i>But for Timothy Treadwell,</i>
<i>this bear was a friend, a savior</i>.

01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:25.204
<i>Amie Huguenard was screaming</i>.

01:37:25.306 --> 01:37:29.367
All of a sudden, the intensity
of Amie's screaming

01:37:29.476 --> 01:37:33.276
reached a new height
and became very, very loud.

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:37.612
And she really now was screaming
at the top of her lungs.

01:37:37.718 --> 01:37:41.984
These horrifying screams
were punctuated by Timothy saying,

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:46.048
"Go away. Leave me.
Go away. Run! Get out of here."

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.789
In other words, Timothy is trying
now to save Amie's life

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:54.596
because Timothy reali <i>z</i> es,
at this point in time during this attack,

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.829
Timothy knows he's gonna die.

01:37:56.937 --> 01:37:58.871
He knows that.

01:37:58.973 --> 01:38:01.669
My sense of listening
to this tape

01:38:01.775 --> 01:38:04.676
is that the bear let go,
probably let go

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:08.270
of the top of his head where
I found massive lacerations.

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:12.250
That is tears of the scalp
away from his head.

01:38:12.353 --> 01:38:15.186
Suddenly, though, the bear,
after letting go,

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:19.783
grabbed Timothy somewhere
in the high leg area.

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:25.093
And Timothy, appropriately in my opinion,
as a human being,

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:29.659
decided now is the time
to save one life anyway.

01:38:29.770 --> 01:38:33.501
If his life was going away,
if his life was fading away,

01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:36.974
<i>now was the time</i>
<i>for Amie to get out</i>.

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:42.949
The expedition coming close to a close,

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:45.348
but I'm still here.

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:47.283
It's been over four months
in the wilderness.

01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:49.549
And a hurricane-force
storm now building.

01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:53.718
Over 50-mile-an-hour winds,
soon over 70.

01:38:53.827 --> 01:38:56.227
The bears safely
heading for their dens.

01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:59.026
The work...
the work successful.

01:38:59.133 --> 01:39:02.796
I'm over 20 pounds lighter.
My clothes are rags.

01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:06.839
I've tried hard. I bleed for them,
I live for them, I die for them.

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:10.570
I love them. I love this.

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:15.845
It's tough work.

01:39:17.952 --> 01:39:21.945
But it's the only work I know.
It's the only work I'll ever want.

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:26.920
Take care of these animals.
Take care of this land.

01:39:27.027 --> 01:39:32.124
<i>He seems to hesitate in leaving</i>
<i>the last frame of his own film</i>.

01:39:32.232 --> 01:39:35.065
It's the only thing I know.

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:37.694
It's the only thing
I wanna know.

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:49.808
<i>Treadwell is gone</i>.

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:52.943
<i>The argument how wrong</i>
<i>or how right he was</i>

01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:56.853
<i>disappears into a distance</i>
<i>into a fog</i>.

01:39:56.957 --> 01:40:00.290
<i>What remains is his footage</i>.

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:04.387
<i>And while we watch the animals</i>
<i>in their joys of being,</i>

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:06.966
<i>in their grace</i>
<i>and ferociousness,</i>

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:09.763
<i>a thought becomes</i>
<i>more and more clear</i>.

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:12.805
<i>That it is not so much</i>
<i>a look at wild nature</i>

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:17.138
<i>as it is an insight</i>
<i>into ourselves, our nature</i>.

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:21.806
<i>And that, for me,</i>
<i>beyond his mission,</i>

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:25.908
<i>gives meaning to his life</i>
<i>and to his death</i>.

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:51.134
<i>Now the longhorns are gone</i>

01:40:51.245 --> 01:40:53.645
<i>And the drovers are gone</i>

01:40:53.747 --> 01:40:56.147
<i>The Comanches are gone</i>

01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:58.980
<i>And the outlaws are gone</i>

01:40:59.086 --> 01:41:01.145
<i>Geronimo's gone</i>

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:03.780
<i>And Sam Bass is gone</i>

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:06.325
<i>And the lion is gone</i>

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:10.693
- <i>And the red wolf is gone</i>
- <i>And Treadwell is gone</i>

01:41:12.332 --> 01:41:16.462
<i>Well, he cursed all the roads</i>
<i>and the old mule</i>

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:21.029
<i>And he cursed the automobile</i>

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:26.775
<i>Said this is no place</i>
<i>for an hombre like I am</i>

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:32.276
<i>In this new world</i>
<i>of asphalt and steel</i>

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:37.857
<i>Then he'd look off</i>
<i>someplace in the distance</i>

01:41:39.059 --> 01:41:42.551
<i>At something</i>
<i>only he could see</i>

01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:48.227
<i>He'd say all that's left now</i>
<i>are the old days</i>

01:41:49.803 --> 01:41:54.103
<i>Damned old coyotes and me</i>

01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:55.869
<i>And they'd go</i>

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:17.729
<i>Now the longhorns are gone</i>

01:42:17.831 --> 01:42:20.231
<i>And the drovers are gone</i>

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:22.962
<i>The Comanches are gone</i>

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:25.334
<i>The outlaws are gone</i>

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:27.669
<i>Now Quantrill is gone</i>

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:30.368
<i>Stan Wanty is gone</i>

01:42:30.477 --> 01:42:32.968
<i>And the lion is gone</i>

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.277
<i>And the red wolf is gone</i>

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.313
<i>One morning they searched</i>
<i>his adobe</i>

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:49.461
<i>He disappeared</i>
<i>without even a word</i>

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:55.261
<i>But that night as the moon</i>
<i>crossed the mountain</i>

01:42:56.904 --> 01:43:00.863
<i>One more coyote was heard</i>

01:43:03.577 --> 01:43:05.442
<i>And he'd go</i>
