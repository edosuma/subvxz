I was arrested because

No. But they think
the act is enough

and motive.

being presented here

that I thought
was interesting.

01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:42.181
You said, in all the years
you worked there,

01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:45.392
you never saw Lizzie
give her father a gift.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:47.144
Is that a true statement?

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:50.064
No. She gave him a ring.

01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:52.691
A ring.
It was from her
high school, I believe.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.444
Other than this ring,

01:00:55.444 --> 01:01:00.157
did you ever see her
give her father anything
as far as you know?

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:01.867
They weren't
that kind of family.

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:03.202
What kind of family
were they?

is the witness expected

JUDGE BLAISDELL: Counsel.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:13.670
You were present
on the morning
of the murders?

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.005
I was there.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:17.382
We have established
that Mrs. Borden

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:20.302
was killed around 9:30
that morning.

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:22.638
Was Lizzie present
at that time?

01:01:22.638 --> 01:01:23.639
At 9:30?

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.058
Around that time, yes.

01:01:26.058 --> 01:01:29.978
And then around 10:30,
when Mr. Borden came home,

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:32.856
you saw Lizzie
at that time also, correct?

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:33.941
BRIDGET: Yes.

01:01:33.941 --> 01:01:35.734
Was this when you
had the discussion

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:37.361
about Mrs. Borden's
whereabouts?

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:40.114
Yes.

01:01:40.114 --> 01:01:42.825
She simply said
that she had to visit
a friend who was sick

01:01:42.825 --> 01:01:45.244
and you were to
finish the windows.

01:01:45.244 --> 01:01:47.746
Summoned by a sick friend.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:50.874
Was the friend named?
No, sir.

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.001
Did Lizzie
show you the note?

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.880
No.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.423
KNOWLTON: Did Mrs. Borden
have a lot of friends?

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.968
Not many.
Not many or not any?

01:02:00.968 --> 01:02:02.803
Maybe one.

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:04.930
Has she been known
to help people in need?

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:07.558
Not especially.

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:10.561
So while you were
being told

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.063
Mrs. Borden was out attending
to her sick friend,

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:17.317
the reality was,
Mrs. Borden was laying dead
in that guest room upstairs.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:18.819
Is that correct?

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.445
Yes.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.827
I was upstairs

01:02:25.827 --> 01:02:30.497
looking out their window
and saw her walk out back

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.833
and place the dress
into a pot
they had in the yard.

01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:36.963
Did she burn the dress?

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:39.799
Yes.

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:41.216
Was there any reason given?

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.303
No.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:50.475
Your report indicates
that you saw a small stain
on her dress.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.478
I did.

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:56.231
But you determined
that it was not blood.

01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.861
I saw a small stain
that looked old

01:02:59.861 --> 01:03:02.029
and did not appear
to be blood.

01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:05.992
KNOWLTON: What did you do
when you observed the stain?

01:03:05.992 --> 01:03:07.492
I asked Miss Borden
about the stain

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:10.037
and she told me
she thought it was
from a stew.

01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:12.456
And that was
all you needed to hear?

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:15.125
Feet away
from two deceased souls,
both violently murdered,

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:19.087
that this possible
blood stain was stew,
and you left it at that?

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:24.092
Would you explain,
for the jury,

01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:28.639
the basic nature
of your duties

01:03:28.639 --> 01:03:31.642
when you arrive,
92 Second Street,
Mr. Hilliard?

01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:35.896
I secure the area
known as the crime scene,
in this case, the house,

01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:39.358
and I conduct
interviews with anybody
who might have been present,

01:03:39.358 --> 01:03:41.818
uh, what is known as
the eyewitness.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.112
Did you interview
Miss Borden?

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.657
I did.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:49.451
What did she witness,
according to her statement?

01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:51.871
She discovered
the body of Andrew Borden.

01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:53.873
She found
her own father, dead.

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.925

Miss Borden on your arrival

01:04:03.925 --> 01:04:08.054
for any marks
or for any blood
on her person?

01:04:08.054 --> 01:04:11.014
Yes, I examined her
for blood or injury.

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:14.768
Miss Lizzie,
could you please
show me your hands?

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.436
JENNINGS:
And you found neither?

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:17.854
I did not.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:22.234
The records do indicate
that you did find
a small stain.

01:04:22.234 --> 01:04:24.152
The nature
of the assault

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:26.738
would have produced
much more blood
than a single stain.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:29.075
KNOWLTON: Unsolicited!

01:04:29.075 --> 01:04:33.495
Can the testimony adhere
to what is known
and not what is assumed?

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:36.790
Is this your first visit
to a violent crime scene?

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.000
It is not.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.877
And is it your opinion
that a bloody crime scene

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.462
is likely to produce
a situation

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:45.007
in which blood would be found
on the perpetrator?

01:04:45.007 --> 01:04:46.341
That is often the case, yes.

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:48.468
Did you, on arrival
to 92 Second Street,

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:51.763
find any evidence of blood
on anyone in the house?

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:53.432
I did not.
Thank you.

01:04:54.976 --> 01:04:56.351
KNOWLTON: Did Lizzie Borden
visit your pharmacy

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:58.437
in the days leading up
to her parents' deaths?

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:01.107
She did.

01:05:01.107 --> 01:05:03.608
What did she
wish to procure?

01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:07.279
Potassium cyanide,
a very toxic poison.

01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:11.616
Excuse me, Mr. Bence.
Will this powder kill
the rats in my attic?

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:15.620
She indicated
that it was for
a vermin problem.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:19.000
The Bordens
experienced extreme
gastrointestinal distress

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.292
prior to their deaths.

01:05:20.292 --> 01:05:22.962
Could that be the result
of cyanide poisoning?

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:25.422
It could, yes.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:29.926
Mr. Bence, did you sell
any potassium cyanide
to Miss Borden?

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:33.055
No. I did not.

01:05:33.055 --> 01:05:34.431
(ALL MURMURING)

01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:37.851
Did either Abby
or Andrew Borden

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:40.062
show any signs of
a defensive wound?

01:05:40.062 --> 01:05:41.229
Neither did.

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:43.857
No marks or cuts
on their hands?

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.150
No, none at all.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:48.278
Anything to show
that they fought
for their lives?

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:51.531
No.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:53.450
Can it be ascertained
that the first blow
to Andrew Borden

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:54.826
was enough to kill him?

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.953
Yes.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:01.000
Evidence of incised
wound 4 inches long,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.959
beginning at the cavity
of the left eye,

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.046
reaching to lower
edge of lower jaw,

01:06:05.046 --> 01:06:09.424
cutting through nose,
upper lip, lower lip,
and slightly into bone.

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:12.135
KNOWLTON:
So the first strike
was the fatal strike?

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:13.512
In my opinion, yes.

01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:14.971
And how many times
was he struck?

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:17.516
Eleven.

01:06:17.516 --> 01:06:23.522
So a single strike
with an ax killed him,
and then 10 more times.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.652
Your post mortem report
from the scene of the crime
indicates that

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:32.280
you found that
Abby Borden died
around 9:30 in the morning

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.117
and Andrew close to 11:00.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.453
How can you make
such a determination?

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:40.580
Well, judging by
the state of rigor,

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.582
the condition of the wounds,
and the texture of the blood,

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:46.169
I would say
more than an hour
passed between each act.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:50.549
So the picture
that's starting to form
seems to emerge thusly.

01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:55.096
Someone killed Abby Borden
with incredible violence.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:59.516
Then paused,

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.436
somehow, somewhere,

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.065
for almost two hours.

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:11.027
Then managed to
repeat the crime
on a second victim.

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:15.198
All without being detected
by two women

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:17.868
who were in
and around the house.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:24.208

we've had the bodies exhumed

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:28.170

from the sidewalk.

MEDICAL EXAMINER: All right.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:12.005
At approximately 11:00 a.m.,
someone stepped up
to Andrew Borden

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:17.219
and struck him 11 times
with a hatchet-like weapon.

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:22.224
The blows left a 4-inch gash
through his temple

01:08:22.224 --> 01:08:26.394
and cut into the bone
of his upper and lower jaw.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.813
Thank you.

a note advising her

she's no longer welcome
in our home.

testify today.

will try to intimidate you.
Prepare yourself.

I'm nervous. I don't...
I don't want to
say anything wrong.

What could you possibly say?
That I'm capable of murder?

01:09:01.263 --> 01:09:04.432
No one in this town thinks
I'm capable of anything.

She is my younger sister.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:27.455
Has Lizzie ever shown
violent tendencies

01:09:27.455 --> 01:09:30.625
or irrational tendencies
in her life?

you describe her?

Kind, gentle, devoted.

01:09:43.389 --> 01:09:46.890
She is deeply involved
in the church and
in the volunteer service.

And how would you describe
her relationship
with your parents?

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:56.026
She was
a good daughter to them.
Obedient, respectful, loving.

on his fourth finger?

Yes, sir.

Did Lizzie give it to him?
Yes.

01:10:05.369 --> 01:10:06.995
Did he wear it often?

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.289
He never
took it off.

01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:10.540
Did your father love Lizzie?

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:13.377
Very much.

No.

You said, "Of course,"

loved your father,

a man's child loves him.

But Bridget Sullivan,
in the house for five years,

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:48.370
testified that
Lizzie never bought him
anything, ever.

Bridget Sullivan is not
the most reliable person
in the world.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.667
Did she lie
on the witness stand?

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:56.127
She didn't see
everything that
happened with our family.

01:10:57.212 --> 01:10:58.588
I suppose not.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:01.591
I want to ask you

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:04.302
about the night

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:08.307
of September 15th,

01:11:08.307 --> 01:11:10.475
when your sister
burned a dress.

01:11:13.395 --> 01:11:15.438
Yes.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:17.607
You were with her
when she was
destroying the dress?

01:11:18.484 --> 01:11:19.818
I was.

01:11:19.818 --> 01:11:23.405
Did she tell you
why she was
destroying the dress?

01:11:23.405 --> 01:11:26.908
We both agreed
the dress needed
to be discarded.

01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:29.244
You both agreed?
Yes.

01:11:30.496 --> 01:11:33.457
It brought back
too many terrible memories.

01:11:33.457 --> 01:11:34.708
We hated having it
in the house.

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:39.587
So I said to her,
"Let's get rid of the thing."

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:42.383
Lizzie,
you can't burn that dress
after they've asked for it.

01:11:42.383 --> 01:11:44.676
They'll think
you're hiding something.

01:11:44.676 --> 01:11:47.929
Were you made aware
that the police inquest
wanted to see that dress?

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:49.473
Not until the next day.

01:11:51.099 --> 01:11:52.308
Lizzie did not mention it?

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:53.309

those exact instructions

01:12:01.485 --> 01:12:04.571
on the day
the dress was destroyed.

01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:07.657
Did you
or did you not conspire

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:10.201
to destroy that dress
because you knew
there was blood on it?

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:11.495
No, I did not.

burn that dress

to destroy evidence of
your parents' murder?

01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:17.500
No, I did not.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.503
If Lizzie did
something that was wrong

01:12:19.503 --> 01:12:21.505
by burning that dress,
then it was my fault.

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:22.422
I told her to do it.

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:24.048
Why did you tell her
to do it?

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:27.343
Because it was
old and terrible
and we wanted it gone.

that a woman could be guilty
of this crime.

I need say nothing
with regard to the blood,
for there was no blood found.

01:14:07.569 --> 01:14:12.031
I need say nothing with regard
to the physical evidence,

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:14.033
because there is
no physical evidence.

to this crime.

No thief did this.

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:26.880
No random assailant.

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:32.802
There was nothing
in these blows

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:39.183
but hatred, hatred
and a desire to kill.

01:14:40.561 --> 01:14:42.729
We have heard testimony

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:45.189

who was seen about
the household

They have produced
no suspect.

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:55.701
But the mere fact that
persons unknown had
access to the property

01:14:55.701 --> 01:14:59.579
is more than enough
to introduce
an element of doubt.

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:03.958
If you can even conceive

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:08.129
of any other hypothesis
in which it is possible

01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:10.965
that someone else
did this deed,

doubt in your mind.

that morning.

went up those stairs.

and devoid of feeling.

That was the Lizzie Borden
who pursued that poor woman

up the stairs to her death,

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:56.010
and then waited,
weapon in hand,

01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:57.428
for the appropriate
moment

01:15:57.428 --> 01:15:59.806

to her father.

01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:12.443
her heart so blackened
with depravity,

01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:16.739
her very existence
such a web
of violence and crime

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:21.661
is to find this
tender young lass guilty.
