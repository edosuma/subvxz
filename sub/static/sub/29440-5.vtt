00:03.027 --> 00:06.868
‐ Laurie?
Oh, my God! Whoo!

00:06.868 --> 00:08.664
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

00:08.664 --> 00:09.666
I would've gotten
a bed ready.

00:09.666 --> 00:10.960
‐ No, don't worry about it!

00:10.960 --> 00:12.254
You know, I'm staying
with a friend anyway.

00:12.254 --> 00:15.176
‐ Thank God.
‐ What's his name...this time?

00:15.176 --> 00:16.178
‐ What you mean, "this time"?

00:18.600 --> 00:22.065
So how long have you two
been a thing?

00:22.065 --> 00:24.069
‐ Yo, Rie, I need you.

00:24.069 --> 00:26.198
My mom, she, like‐‐
she got fucked up.

00:26.198 --> 00:28.411
I need you to take care
of Darius and Darren.

00:28.411 --> 00:30.666
You think we gonna get
married and have kids?

00:30.666 --> 00:32.920
Kids that turn out
like Darius and Darren?

00:32.920 --> 00:34.924
Is that what you really want?

00:34.924 --> 00:37.178
‐ Yes.
‐ You don't get it.

00:39.559 --> 00:41.020
‐ This shit sound kinda right.

00:42.439 --> 00:44.986
‐ Four! And then yo' ass,
you come in next.

00:44.986 --> 00:47.700
‐ As long as my gun clap,
I ain't gotta rap.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.161
‐ Where's Shotgun at?

00:49.161 --> 00:50.539
‐ Something happened
with a forklift.

00:50.539 --> 00:53.502
He messed up his ankle.
He ain't been back since.

00:53.502 --> 00:55.340
‐ Fuck this shit. We'll find
another way to get the weed.

00:56.718 --> 00:58.387
‐ Did you say weed?

00:58.387 --> 01:00.099
That's the hustle
we need.

01:00.099 --> 01:01.978
It's foolproof.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.399
No 5‐0, no real comp.

01:04.399 --> 01:05.861
Shit is stress‐free.

01:05.861 --> 01:07.740
My son heady
sent me a kite.

01:07.740 --> 01:09.451
Said that nigga 'Vine
got fucked up

01:09.451 --> 01:11.372
and thrown in the box.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.543
Heard he lookin' at, like, 20.

01:13.543 --> 01:14.879
That nigga
rockin' the box.

01:14.879 --> 01:17.425
You gonna be shittin'
on the hood now.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.887
This ride is yours.

01:18.887 --> 01:21.517
Christmas came early, my nigga.

01:21.517 --> 01:23.104
‐ Whoo‐hoo‐hoo!

01:23.104 --> 01:24.857
‐ It's not just you up in here.

01:24.857 --> 01:26.528
It's us, your family.

01:26.528 --> 01:27.780
‐ I'll take the deal.

01:30.326 --> 01:34.334
Everything felt just...dark...

01:36.255 --> 01:39.177
And wrong.

01:39.177 --> 01:43.436
It felt like I was in some
kinda, uh, monster movie.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.022
And when I looked up, you know,

01:45.022 --> 01:49.239
I suddenly realized
that I was the monster.

01:49.239 --> 01:52.955
And the people that I was
terrorizing was my family...

01:54.584 --> 01:57.255
The people that I loved.

01:57.255 --> 01:59.760
Hey, I‐I hurt myself.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.390
I hurt my moms. I...

02:02.390 --> 02:05.188
I hurt my relationship
to the Lord.

02:05.188 --> 02:09.780
By the time I realized
that I was a‐‐an addict,

02:09.780 --> 02:11.576
it was too late, you know?

02:11.576 --> 02:14.039
Crack had consumed my life.

02:16.335 --> 02:18.715
Uh, I was a fiend.

02:30.948 --> 02:34.371
I don't know
if I could ever forgive myself

02:34.371 --> 02:36.918
for the‐‐
the pain I caused.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.592
But I...

02:40.592 --> 02:42.470
but I wanna change.

02:43.723 --> 02:47.063
You know, crack‐‐
crack will never own me again.

02:58.085 --> 02:59.087
Thank you.

03:01.133 --> 03:05.224
‐ Crack cocaine is waging
a brutal war on our island.

03:05.224 --> 03:08.982
And I intend to be brutal back.

03:13.407 --> 03:16.915
But I believe a successful war

03:16.915 --> 03:21.298
is only measured by how
we treat the survivors,

03:21.298 --> 03:23.720
who are its real victims.

03:26.516 --> 03:29.022
I'm releasing you on parole,
Mr. Diggs.

03:29.022 --> 03:30.776
Eight months to be served

03:30.776 --> 03:33.322
in a rehab facility
of the court's choosing.

03:35.284 --> 03:37.665
Good luck, and merry Christmas.

03:49.647 --> 03:52.528
‐

05:31.934 --> 05:34.480
Damn, who is this?
Oh, shit.

05:34.480 --> 05:38.030
This is that joint I heard
in Park Hill the other day.

05:38.030 --> 05:40.911
Someone from our
neighborhood made this shit?

05:40.911 --> 05:42.748
Now they're playing it here?

05:42.748 --> 05:45.002
Then you know
this shit is phat.

05:48.425 --> 05:51.139
Yo, you make
this beat, man?

05:51.139 --> 05:52.726
‐ Yeah.
‐ It sound like a hit.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.651
‐ And one day soon,
that real shit?

05:56.651 --> 05:59.197
Yeah, that's gonna be
up on that wall.

06:00.115 --> 06:02.036
‐ Yo, sugar sell the pie, man.

06:02.036 --> 06:04.082
‐ Let me, uh...

06:04.082 --> 06:06.921
Give me some of them
blank tapes.

06:13.935 --> 06:16.524
Don't sell this shit
to nobody else, all right?

06:16.524 --> 06:18.068
If more come in,

06:18.068 --> 06:20.489
put 'em in the back
and I'll buy you out.

06:20.489 --> 06:22.744
‐ Why this one?
You think they sound different?

06:22.744 --> 06:25.332
‐ Red top, blue top.
‐

06:25.332 --> 06:28.255
Yo, you trying to brand
like you out on the block?

06:28.255 --> 06:29.550
‐ Why not?

06:29.550 --> 06:31.344
All this shit is dope, right?

06:31.344 --> 06:34.017
‐ Yes, it is, man.
‐

06:34.017 --> 06:36.104
‐ Ah.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.273
Come on, cripple.

06:37.273 --> 06:39.319
‐ I can't believe
I got hurt at work.

06:40.864 --> 06:42.617
Yo, with these crutches...
‐ Uh‐huh.

06:42.617 --> 06:43.911
‐ Getting to the bus,

06:43.911 --> 06:46.166
the ferry...

06:46.166 --> 06:47.168
in the winter?

06:47.168 --> 06:48.588
Psh.

06:48.588 --> 06:50.341
I was late for work
every day, bro.

06:50.341 --> 06:53.598
‐ Damn.
‐ Felt bad as a motherfucker.

06:53.598 --> 06:55.727
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ So I had to quit.

06:55.727 --> 06:57.522
‐ Psh.
‐ Plus, my living situation‐‐

06:57.522 --> 06:58.858
I mean, I love my moms,

06:58.858 --> 07:00.779
but I can't be up in there
no more.

07:00.779 --> 07:02.699
‐ So where you staying at now?
‐ My nigga Rebel's,

07:02.699 --> 07:04.995
till I get my own spot.

07:04.995 --> 07:06.164
‐ Hey, if you're looking
for any cash,

07:06.164 --> 07:07.374
let me know
if you want to be put on.

07:07.374 --> 07:08.836
‐ Come on, now,
you know that ain't me.

07:08.836 --> 07:10.255
You know that.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.967
Something gonna work out.

07:15.265 --> 07:16.392
You hear that shit?

07:16.392 --> 07:17.854
‐ Yeah!
‐ That's my shit.

07:27.833 --> 07:28.918
You murderin' that.

07:28.918 --> 07:30.504
‐ Yo.
You hear that?

07:30.504 --> 07:32.174
‐ Hell, yeah.
‐ Uh‐huh.

07:32.174 --> 07:33.845
‐ Yeah, nigga.
The whole hood is feelin' you.

07:33.845 --> 07:35.222
‐ Shit.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.224
Shit, them dreads
need to start

07:36.224 --> 07:38.103
sellin' our shit in there, son.

07:39.857 --> 07:41.067
What you got in there?

07:41.067 --> 07:42.278
‐ Oh, shit.

07:42.278 --> 07:44.198
I was tryin'
to show you these, yo.

07:44.198 --> 07:46.119
‐ I like that yellow and black.
‐ You fuck with that?

07:46.119 --> 07:47.246
‐ Hell, yeah.
‐ Yellow and black, right?

07:47.246 --> 07:48.456
‐ Have them tapes
swarmin' in the hood

07:48.456 --> 07:49.960
like killer bees and shit.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.504
‐ I like that shit, nigga.

07:51.504 --> 07:53.801
‐ Damn, son.
You definitely found your lane.

07:53.801 --> 07:55.722
That beat is hard.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.145
‐ Respect.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.232
‐ Shit, I already got
the next joint.

08:12.254 --> 08:14.508
‐ Yo, I fuck with that, nigga.
‐ Oh, shit.

08:14.508 --> 08:17.891
Ooh, I got a couple lines.
Let me write that down.

08:17.891 --> 08:19.645
I heard Divine
gettin' out today.

08:19.645 --> 08:21.356
You really stepped it up
while he was gone.

08:21.356 --> 08:22.943
‐ Yeah.

08:22.943 --> 08:24.320
‐ Tell your brother
I said what's up.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.740
‐ I will.

08:25.740 --> 08:28.663
‐ All right, boy.
‐ All right.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.171
‐ Gotta make moves, son.

08:33.171 --> 08:35.467
Talk soon.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.900
‐ Curfew is at 2300, sharp.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.197
You must get and keep a job
to live here.

08:46.197 --> 08:48.953
Employment is mandatory.
No visitors allowed.

08:48.953 --> 08:51.082
Group therapy is mandatory.

08:51.082 --> 08:52.418
This way.

08:55.967 --> 08:58.221
Don't touch each other.

08:58.221 --> 09:01.687
Violate any of these rules
and your ass will be violated.

09:03.023 --> 09:06.864
I see fiends like you
come and go by the thousands.

09:06.864 --> 09:11.080
I don't do no favors,
and I don't suffer no fools.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.124
‐ Yo.

09:12.124 --> 09:14.253
Check this out, big man.

09:14.253 --> 09:16.884
I ain't ask you for no favors.

09:16.884 --> 09:18.888
I damn sure ain't no fool.

09:18.888 --> 09:20.515
‐

09:20.515 --> 09:22.896
You don't want to mess with me.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.818
I will throw your ass out
of here like a fucking javelin.

09:25.818 --> 09:28.991
You'll be right back
serving your full sentence.

09:28.991 --> 09:30.870
You understand me, youngblood?

09:33.668 --> 09:36.047
‐ Yeah.

09:36.047 --> 09:37.759
I understand.

09:40.305 --> 09:43.436
‐ Must feel real good
to have your boy back home.

09:43.436 --> 09:46.317
‐ I couldn't take another day
with him in the cage.

09:46.317 --> 09:49.866
And I couldn't thank you enough
for sending us that lawyer.

09:49.866 --> 09:52.831
‐ That's a big order,
smart lady.

09:52.831 --> 09:55.043
You know, my Aunt Gina
always used to say

09:55.043 --> 09:57.047
you want to keep a man
out of trouble,

09:57.047 --> 09:58.718
keep his stomach full

09:58.718 --> 10:00.387
and his balls empty.

10:00.387 --> 10:03.226
First part's your territory...
obviously.

10:03.226 --> 10:04.646
‐

10:04.646 --> 10:06.065
‐ Ricky.

10:06.065 --> 10:08.403
Looks like your sister
and Ricky are hittin' it off.

10:10.575 --> 10:12.537
You got my numbers,
right, Ricky?

10:18.799 --> 10:22.097
So how come y'all don't
play the numbers here?

10:22.097 --> 10:23.851
‐ 'Cause I don't shit
where I eat.

10:23.851 --> 10:25.730
You could learn somethin'
from that.

10:27.065 --> 10:28.652
The first time
I played your song,

10:28.652 --> 10:30.782
I had my whole class dancing.

10:30.782 --> 10:32.535
Even the girls.

10:32.535 --> 10:33.871
‐ Oh, word?

10:33.871 --> 10:35.708
You was dancing with the girls?

10:35.708 --> 10:37.461
‐ I tried to,
and then Miss Shesh came over

10:37.461 --> 10:38.881
and took the tape.

10:38.881 --> 10:40.383
Can you make me
another copy, Bobby?

10:40.383 --> 10:43.181
‐ Yeah, of course I can
make you another copy.

10:43.181 --> 10:45.101
I can make all your friends
copies.

10:45.101 --> 10:47.607
I just bought a bunch
of blank tapes today.

10:47.607 --> 10:49.945
Can somebody
give me a hand?

10:49.945 --> 10:51.657
‐ Yo, Aunt Laurie!

10:51.657 --> 10:55.330
How long it's been, huh? Oh!
‐

10:55.330 --> 10:58.002
I don't know,
but I'm happy to see you.

10:58.002 --> 10:59.965
You know my visit
would not have been complete

10:59.965 --> 11:02.261
without laying my eyes
on the man of the house.

11:02.261 --> 11:03.513
Hey.

11:03.513 --> 11:06.394
How's your mom?
Is she okay?

11:06.394 --> 11:08.273
‐ Yeah, she doing good.

11:08.273 --> 11:09.526
Yo.

11:09.526 --> 11:11.989
What is this, Pelle Pelle?

11:11.989 --> 11:14.201
Man, you always had
the flyest shit.

11:14.201 --> 11:15.788
‐ Well, you know,
times have been good.

11:15.788 --> 11:18.209
‐ Uh‐huh. Uh‐huh.
‐

11:18.209 --> 11:19.671
‐ Aunt Laurie, you know,

11:19.671 --> 11:21.257
you didn't have to buy
all this.

11:21.257 --> 11:23.679
‐ Well, I would have,
but actually,

11:23.679 --> 11:25.975
it was Bobby
that paid for this.

11:25.975 --> 11:28.939
Can we eat now?
I'm hungry.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.400
‐ Yo.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.489
I been trying to get you
to check this out.

11:33.489 --> 11:34.659
My new joint I did with Shotgun

11:34.659 --> 11:36.580
playing at the record store
today.

11:36.580 --> 11:38.333
I might even get them
to sell that shit.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.796
Where you been at lately?

11:40.796 --> 11:42.507
‐ Yeah, my moms got me
puttin' in overtime

11:42.507 --> 11:45.096
with my brothers and shit,
so you know how that go.

11:48.812 --> 11:52.402
‐ This place is looking like
Radio Shack.

11:52.402 --> 11:54.574
Shit, I see you making
a come‐up.

11:56.202 --> 11:57.830
‐ Yeah.

11:57.830 --> 12:01.087
You told me to step my game up,

12:01.087 --> 12:03.257
so I did.

12:04.343 --> 12:06.974
‐ Well, we need to get back
to the real game.

12:12.025 --> 12:15.198
‐ Yo, all the rent and bills
are paid off.

12:16.450 --> 12:18.204
You know that, right?

12:18.998 --> 12:21.335
We got food in the fridge.

12:22.212 --> 12:25.343
So how is this not
the real game?

12:28.559 --> 12:32.692
‐ Selling weed to Wall Street
is not a model with growth.

12:32.692 --> 12:33.986
Growth?

12:33.986 --> 12:35.363
We got shit covered over here.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.908
‐ Yeah, for real, 'Vine.

12:36.908 --> 12:39.664
This shit the easiest money
we ever made, yo.

12:39.664 --> 12:42.335
We ain't competin'
with no street niggas.

12:42.335 --> 12:44.883
And the cops ain't even
comin' around, son.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.389
‐ I was tryin'
to build somethin'

12:48.389 --> 12:50.978
that was gonna take
all of us outta here.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.523
You know, get a‐‐
get a lab

12:52.523 --> 12:55.487
up in fuckin' Grimes Hill
or somewhere.

12:55.487 --> 12:58.367
And your measly hustle
is bullshit.

12:59.161 --> 13:00.998
‐ Bullshit?

13:04.589 --> 13:06.760
Well, Ma don't think
it's bullshit.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.014
‐ I went to jail
'cause of you two.

13:09.014 --> 13:10.851
‐ Yo' ass got out
because of us too.

13:10.851 --> 13:13.272
‐ I lost all my money
'cause of you two niggas.

13:13.272 --> 13:15.443
You two niggas handed
the fucking game to Power,

13:15.443 --> 13:18.700
and I'm supposed to say...
thank you?

13:20.036 --> 13:22.457
Nah, nigga, fuck you!

13:32.979 --> 13:35.400
‐ Don't you got a curfew?

13:49.303 --> 13:51.390
You sittin' there,
and this bitch

13:51.390 --> 13:54.229
just starin' at you

13:54.229 --> 13:56.568
with a yellow notepad,

13:56.568 --> 13:58.446
just writin' shit down.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.993
Who she even gonna show
that shit to?

14:02.454 --> 14:06.378
And that's why black folks
don't go to therapy.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.592
Church
is all the therapy I need.

14:08.592 --> 14:10.345
‐ Yeah...

14:10.345 --> 14:13.517
but they always want you
to talk to God.

14:13.517 --> 14:16.650
What if he ain't talking back?

14:16.650 --> 14:22.035
‐ We all just fightin' to keep
that tiny fire of hope goin'.

14:22.035 --> 14:25.458
But hope can hurt
like a motherfucker.

14:25.458 --> 14:29.091
Divine, would
you like to share something?

14:30.093 --> 14:31.261
Hope?

14:31.261 --> 14:33.057
I know what that feels like.

14:33.057 --> 14:34.518
When you're out there
with your friends...

14:34.518 --> 14:36.271
Yo, Power!

14:36.271 --> 14:38.484
Just trying to be a kid,
you know?

14:38.484 --> 14:39.862
How much you make
out here a day

14:39.862 --> 14:40.990
selling newspapers?

14:40.990 --> 14:42.367
My best, 20 bucks.

14:42.367 --> 14:43.537
Not bad.

14:43.537 --> 14:46.960
When you're 10, 11,
20 bucks is great.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.006
But how about when you're 14?

14:49.006 --> 14:50.551
18?

14:50.551 --> 14:51.970
22?
You gotta have a bigger plan.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.890
You want to get off
the toll booth

14:53.890 --> 14:55.143
so you're not
selling newspapers

14:55.143 --> 14:56.145
to people in cars like mine

14:56.145 --> 14:58.024
but driving one yourself.

14:58.859 --> 15:01.488
But then life
hits you...hard.

15:04.494 --> 15:07.543
And all you're trying to do
is make it through the day.

15:07.543 --> 15:09.756
‐ Look at that.

15:09.756 --> 15:11.508
Man of the house.

15:11.508 --> 15:13.972
Taking care of his mama.

15:13.972 --> 15:15.559
Ooh, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

15:15.559 --> 15:17.563
And you realize
that hope,

15:17.563 --> 15:19.692
hope is a lie you tell
yourself to keep going.

15:25.662 --> 15:28.585
Hey, yo, Bobby.
‐ Hey, what's good, yo?

15:28.585 --> 15:30.379
‐ Hey, yo, I listened
to your tape, nigga.

15:30.379 --> 15:33.302
How you let that Park Hill
bitch dis us like that, son?

15:34.639 --> 15:35.766
‐ The fuck
is you talking about?

15:39.774 --> 15:42.320
‐ That ain't no dis, nigga.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.617
That's fuckin' hip‐hop, yo.
‐ Nah, fuck that.

15:44.617 --> 15:46.370
You let that Park Hill clown

15:46.370 --> 15:47.915
dis you
on your own track, nigga.

15:47.915 --> 15:49.627
That don't mean nothing
to you, son?

15:49.627 --> 15:50.921
‐ Hey, take that shit outside.

15:50.921 --> 15:53.175
We don't need none of that
in here.

15:55.848 --> 15:57.643
‐

16:04.114 --> 16:06.160
Yo, our mom
don't be playin' at all.

16:44.779 --> 16:48.410
‐

16:48.410 --> 16:50.749
‐ All right. Hey, yo,
you want to hit this with me?

16:50.749 --> 16:52.001
‐ Nah, I don't want to fuck up

16:52.001 --> 16:53.672
you and your girl's
alone time, son.

16:53.672 --> 16:55.968
‐ Come on, do it look
like she mind?

16:55.968 --> 16:59.015
Hey, yo, Tina,
do you mind?

17:01.646 --> 17:03.190
‐ A'ight, son.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.194
‐ Hey, I just got this shit
the other day.

17:05.194 --> 17:07.031
'Bout to shine on niggas.

17:07.031 --> 17:08.867
‐ Hey, yo, where you got
that shit from?

17:08.867 --> 17:11.373
Rockaway Beach?
‐

17:11.373 --> 17:12.917
‐ Hey, stop playin' with me.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.378
I got this shit
from the Diamond District.

17:14.378 --> 17:15.506
Shit official.

17:15.506 --> 17:17.720
‐ Yeah, official you got took,
nigga.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.932
Them rocks cloudier
than this fucking room.

17:19.932 --> 17:21.476
‐

17:21.476 --> 17:22.938
Hey.

17:22.938 --> 17:25.358
I've been meaning
to tell you too,

17:25.358 --> 17:27.823
I seen you
at the Park Villa battle.

17:27.823 --> 17:29.660
I ain't know
you could spit like that.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.204
That shit was fire.

17:31.204 --> 17:33.668
‐ Yeah, you ain't even gotta
tell me, son.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.091
Hey, yo,
you still making beats?

17:37.091 --> 17:38.510
‐ I never stopped.

17:38.510 --> 17:40.056
There just ain't been
nobody dope enough

17:40.056 --> 17:42.561
to rhyme over my shit,
you know?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.147
You hear Shotgun's joint?

17:44.147 --> 17:45.901
That shit's trash.

17:50.117 --> 17:51.579
Yo, that shit tight, son.

17:51.579 --> 17:53.541
‐ Yeah, yeah. Hey.

17:53.541 --> 17:55.754
Hey, jump on the mic.
Lay some shit down.

17:55.754 --> 17:59.344
We can come way harder
than that Killa Hill track.

18:13.205 --> 18:14.583
‐ Yo!

18:14.583 --> 18:17.213
That verse was crazy!

18:17.213 --> 18:19.217
Hey, I told you the acoustics
in here was special, right?

18:19.217 --> 18:20.679
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:20.679 --> 18:22.014
‐ Just go ahead and hit me
with that next verse, nigga.

18:22.014 --> 18:23.267
‐

18:29.487 --> 18:31.408
Yo, what's good, shorty,
what's good?

18:31.408 --> 18:32.911
What you listenin' to?

18:32.911 --> 18:34.330
‐ The nigga Shotgun joint.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.084
What else would I be bumpin'?

18:36.084 --> 18:37.671
‐ Yeah, a'ight.

18:39.007 --> 18:40.509
‐ You know, I rhyme too.

18:48.275 --> 18:49.779
Uh‐huh, yeah.

18:58.504 --> 18:59.632
Yeah, that's that
real rap right there.

19:07.648 --> 19:09.192
‐ Hey, yo.

19:09.192 --> 19:11.404
Hey, make sure this shit spread
through the streets, a'ight?

19:48.270 --> 19:51.276
‐ Ooh‐hoo‐hoo!
Your ass is funky.

19:51.276 --> 19:54.533
Underarms hummin' like some
cut onions or somethin'.

19:54.533 --> 19:56.954
Yo, you need to put some
Egyptian Musk on, son.

19:56.954 --> 19:59.835
Word.
‐ Hey, what is it, nigga?

19:59.835 --> 20:00.962
‐ You heard this?

20:00.962 --> 20:02.173
Dennis put out a tape
on his own.

20:02.173 --> 20:04.803
Boo‐yah.
Check it out, son.

20:04.803 --> 20:07.099
Been tearin' up the streets
all day.

20:07.099 --> 20:10.356
Your boy D‐Lover came out
of retirement.

20:10.356 --> 20:12.360
He got himself a hit, boy!

20:12.360 --> 20:13.863
Huh!

20:30.563 --> 20:32.066
‐ He callin' you out, son!

20:39.414 --> 20:41.084
‐ Ho, ho, ho!

20:41.084 --> 20:43.046
Merry Christmas...
‐ Hey!

20:43.046 --> 20:44.675
‐ My favorite family Diggs.
‐ Hi.

20:44.675 --> 20:46.011
‐ Hello.

20:46.011 --> 20:49.392
‐ Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

20:49.392 --> 20:51.354
‐ Oh.
‐

20:51.354 --> 20:52.774
‐

20:52.774 --> 20:54.444
Randy, no,
you ain't to open that.

20:54.444 --> 20:56.741
‐ No, let him open it.
It's okay.

20:56.741 --> 20:59.747
I always hated waiting too.

21:03.253 --> 21:04.840
‐ Whoa!

21:04.840 --> 21:06.426
Oh, my gosh.

21:06.426 --> 21:07.637
‐ Girl, that's too much,
even for you.

21:07.637 --> 21:08.806
I always wanted
one of these!

21:08.806 --> 21:10.476
‐ Girl, relax.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.482
My number hit.

21:13.482 --> 21:14.902
Where'd you play
the numbers?

21:14.902 --> 21:16.154
At the Rib Shack.

21:17.490 --> 21:19.243
You should've seen
Larry's face.

21:19.243 --> 21:21.957
Girl, I told you,
it was all in the cards.

21:21.957 --> 21:24.378
You know, sometimes
you just gotta

21:24.378 --> 21:25.882
open yourself up to the world

21:25.882 --> 21:30.015
and good forces will come
to yo' aid.

21:30.015 --> 21:31.977
‐ Gotta go check the oven.

21:43.041 --> 21:46.256
‐ So how you livin',
pretty girl?

21:47.717 --> 21:49.888
How's your man?

21:51.349 --> 21:53.019
‐ At first, I thought
he was just messed up

21:53.019 --> 21:57.319
'cause of his moms,
but now it just feels like‐‐

21:57.319 --> 21:59.448
I don't know.

22:01.745 --> 22:04.333
‐ You want me to knock
some sense into him for you?

22:06.337 --> 22:07.799
Here.

22:09.928 --> 22:11.431
Open it.

22:13.351 --> 22:14.730
‐ "The Piano Lesson"?

22:14.730 --> 22:16.734
‐
On Broadway.

22:16.734 --> 22:18.236
‐

22:18.236 --> 22:20.199
‐ I saw it
when I was in Chicago once.

22:20.199 --> 22:21.619
I know you'll love it.

22:22.913 --> 22:24.541
You should take Dennis.

22:25.835 --> 22:28.925
‐ Oh.
‐

22:38.360 --> 22:41.366
So you got something to drink?

22:41.366 --> 22:43.286
In the back of the cupboard,
if you know what I mean.

22:43.286 --> 22:44.623
‐ What'd you give that girl?

22:46.710 --> 22:49.507
‐ A little bit of inspiration.

22:49.507 --> 22:52.973
Which you may think of
giving her from time to time.

22:53.849 --> 22:55.979
‐ You show up
every couple of years

22:55.979 --> 22:58.358
with a new song and dance.

22:58.358 --> 23:00.571
New job, new coat.

23:00.571 --> 23:02.283
You come and go as you please.

23:02.283 --> 23:05.414
‐ Okay, first of all,
don't get mad at me

23:05.414 --> 23:07.794
'cause I never got tied down,
Linda.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.173
I live life.

23:10.173 --> 23:12.303
And I go where it takes me.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.265
‐ And the problem with going
where life takes you

23:14.265 --> 23:16.937
is that you are never
going anywhere.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.774
You're in and out of beds.
You're in and out of doors.

23:18.774 --> 23:19.776
You're nowhere.

23:21.864 --> 23:23.534
‐ I don't‐‐
‐ Go ahead.

23:23.534 --> 23:24.995
I can't wait to hear the excuse

23:24.995 --> 23:26.874
that comes out of your mouth
this time.

23:33.386 --> 23:37.604
‐ Well, I can tell
when I've worn out my welcome.

23:53.761 --> 23:55.807
Keep the love alive, baby girl.

24:15.262 --> 24:16.431
Okay, so you guys

24:16.431 --> 24:17.809
have the next few days off,

24:17.809 --> 24:20.355
so you won't have me
harpin' at ya.

24:20.355 --> 24:22.610
That being said,
you all need to use this time

24:22.610 --> 24:24.865
to go out there
and look for a job.

24:24.865 --> 24:28.747
Hit it hard.
Really pound the pavement.

24:36.638 --> 24:38.726
‐
‐

25:02.649 --> 25:05.403
'Vine?
‐ Yeah, babe?

25:10.540 --> 25:12.251
‐

25:13.169 --> 25:15.131
‐ Yo, I told you
not to get me nothin'.

25:15.131 --> 25:17.637
‐ Just open it, baby.

25:17.637 --> 25:19.431
Open it.

25:29.911 --> 25:31.582
I figured it could help you

25:31.582 --> 25:33.961
look more professional
for your job interviews.

25:33.961 --> 25:37.885
Plus, I know you have
a real strict curfew.

25:37.885 --> 25:41.058
And I don't want nothing
taking you away from me again.

25:41.058 --> 25:42.687
You like it?

25:42.687 --> 25:44.148
Try it on.
Come on.

25:44.148 --> 25:45.776
‐ I mean, baby,
it ain't my color, so...

25:45.776 --> 25:47.029
‐ But you're still
gonna wear it.

25:47.029 --> 25:48.489
‐

25:50.578 --> 25:52.540
‐ Is that too tight?
Okay.

25:54.501 --> 25:56.673
Looks good.

25:56.673 --> 25:58.092
‐ I love it. Thank you.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.379
‐ Larry.

26:16.379 --> 26:18.216
Is everything all right, honey?

26:18.216 --> 26:20.428
‐ Hey, doll.
We gotta talk.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.043
‐ Bobby.
Turn the music off.

26:36.043 --> 26:38.047
‐ No, no, Bobby, that's okay.

26:38.047 --> 26:39.425
We like music.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.819
Tell us what you think
of this track.

27:04.308 --> 27:07.940
Whoo!
Whoo!

27:25.517 --> 27:26.895
Mom!

27:26.895 --> 27:28.857
‐ Randy, stay upstairs.

27:29.984 --> 27:31.780
Shurrie.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.742
Go see about your brother.

27:37.792 --> 27:40.839
‐ You know what this song
is about?

27:40.839 --> 27:42.509
Thieves.

27:42.509 --> 27:45.766
Filthy fuckin' cheaters.

27:45.766 --> 27:47.227
‐ We ain't steal nothing
from you.

27:47.227 --> 27:49.189
Sweetheart...
we're not saying

27:49.189 --> 27:50.943
you stole anything.

27:53.322 --> 27:55.243
Linda, where's your sister?

27:55.243 --> 27:58.917
‐ My sister?
‐ Yeah. She did something.

27:58.917 --> 28:00.838
‐ Yeah, what this fat fuck
is trying to say

28:00.838 --> 28:02.340
is, your pig sister

28:02.340 --> 28:04.804
and one of our guys
cheated on the numbers.

28:04.804 --> 28:07.810
And since our guy is, uh...
missing

28:07.810 --> 28:09.438
and he can't pay us back

28:09.438 --> 28:10.941
and your sister's
in the wind...

28:12.612 --> 28:14.949
Somebody else has gotta
make it right.

28:17.705 --> 28:19.166
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

28:32.902 --> 28:35.156
‐ Yo, I‐I can't believe
she did us like that.

28:35.156 --> 28:37.077
‐ I can.

28:37.077 --> 28:38.580
I'll deal with her another day.

28:39.749 --> 28:42.420
Right now, we need to keep
this family safe.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.383
‐ All right.
I'll handle it.

28:44.383 --> 28:47.097
No.
You just got out.

28:47.097 --> 28:48.516
You're not jeopardizing
your parole

28:48.516 --> 28:50.144
by getting caught up
in all this.

28:50.144 --> 28:52.482
Ma.
‐ She's right.

28:55.531 --> 28:56.783
I've got this.

28:59.037 --> 29:00.833
The basement is all mine?

29:00.833 --> 29:03.839
‐ Well, you always said
you wanted your own room.

29:06.093 --> 29:09.684
‐ Shit.
Yours is bigger than mine.

29:09.684 --> 29:11.311
‐ Thanks, 'Vine.

29:16.698 --> 29:19.202
Come here.

29:19.202 --> 29:20.873
You like it?

29:20.873 --> 29:23.085
It's our new home!

29:23.085 --> 29:25.381
Come on, let's go.

29:25.381 --> 29:28.471
‐ I can't believe it.

29:29.974 --> 29:32.228
I think I'm dreaming.

29:32.228 --> 29:36.403
‐ Well, uh, I signed
the lease yesterday.

29:36.403 --> 29:40.829
So, uh, Merry Christmas, Mom.

29:51.643 --> 29:54.481
‐ How's your moms
and the rest of the fam?

29:54.481 --> 29:56.151
‐ Oh, you know,
everyone's good.

29:56.151 --> 29:58.280
‐ Yo, I heard one of Bobby's
tracks the other day.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.951
That shit was on point.

29:59.951 --> 30:02.497
That nigga's got some
serious talent, yo.

30:02.497 --> 30:03.875
For real.

30:04.961 --> 30:07.048
‐ Hmm.

30:07.048 --> 30:08.384
‐ Yo, 'Vine.

30:08.384 --> 30:09.971
I just want to say,

30:09.971 --> 30:12.350
I didn't like how all that shit
went down.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.776
But, you know, me and Cressy

30:16.776 --> 30:18.738
can't get involved
in that shit.

30:18.738 --> 30:20.534
I'm glad Bobby and D
came out okay.

30:20.534 --> 30:22.245
‐ Yo, I never put that on you.

30:22.245 --> 30:23.623
You always had my back.

30:25.042 --> 30:28.925
And, uh, I need you to have
my back right now.

30:30.303 --> 30:31.723
‐ What you need?

30:33.768 --> 30:35.814
‐ I want back in.

30:37.943 --> 30:40.364
‐ You just got out.

30:40.364 --> 30:43.120
Your PO's watching
your every move.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.749
You need to finish
that shit first.

30:44.749 --> 30:46.251
‐ No, come on, G,
it's important.

30:46.251 --> 30:48.255
‐ Bobby's got his
little hustle going.

30:48.255 --> 30:49.424
Hang out with your girl.

30:49.424 --> 30:50.761
Spend time with your fam.

30:50.761 --> 30:52.513
It's Christmas.

30:58.442 --> 31:00.154
Come and see me
when you're free and clear.

31:03.620 --> 31:04.705
Yo, if you need money‐‐

31:04.705 --> 31:05.707
‐ Nah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

31:05.707 --> 31:06.876
I'm good.

31:08.420 --> 31:10.801
Yo, I...

31:10.801 --> 31:12.428
I better be headin'.

31:17.230 --> 31:18.650
‐ All right, son.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.994
Peace.
‐ Yeah.

31:28.335 --> 31:29.839
Now, who is this?

31:29.839 --> 31:31.049
I don't know.

31:31.049 --> 31:32.886
Whoever he is,
he is coming back

31:32.886 --> 31:34.932
at Killa Hill hard.

31:34.932 --> 31:37.228
Stapleton got MCs too.

31:37.228 --> 31:39.357
Staten Island
gon' crush Brooklyn,

31:39.357 --> 31:40.944
Queens, and the Bronx.

31:51.214 --> 31:54.680
‐ You got a talent you can't
just be triflin' with.

31:54.680 --> 31:59.022
You spittin' straight fire
on this.

31:59.022 --> 32:00.609
‐ Yeah, I fuckin' am.

32:09.668 --> 32:12.423
‐ Hey, yo, I need you to come
with me uptown.

32:15.722 --> 32:18.686
Yo, my moms is in trouble.

32:26.368 --> 32:30.877
We gotta cop some more weed,
a'ight, go harder.

32:36.304 --> 32:37.766
Shurrie.

32:37.766 --> 32:38.768
What?

32:39.645 --> 32:42.400
‐ I had to take back
Randy's Atari

32:42.400 --> 32:45.740
and all the other gifts
that Aunt Laurie bought.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.243
So if Laurie gave you
something else,

32:47.243 --> 32:50.792
it's time to stand
by your family and help.

32:56.052 --> 32:58.975
‐  She bought me tickets
to a play.

33:05.572 --> 33:07.534
‐ You're gonna have
to return them.

33:07.534 --> 33:10.331
Or give them to me.
I'll sell 'em.

33:10.331 --> 33:11.499
‐ Mom, the play is tonight.

33:11.499 --> 33:12.878
‐ Those tickets were bought

33:12.878 --> 33:14.339
with stolen money.

33:14.339 --> 33:15.800
‐ It's not fair!

33:15.800 --> 33:17.053
You talkin' about, it's bad?

33:17.053 --> 33:19.098
It's bought with stolen money?

33:19.098 --> 33:23.273
Your rent is paid for by Bobby
and Divine selling drugs.

33:31.289 --> 33:35.715
‐ When you support a house
full of kids all on your own,

33:35.715 --> 33:41.434
then you can come tell me
about what's not fair.

33:53.918 --> 33:56.924
‐
‐

33:56.924 --> 33:58.678
Oh!
Mm.

33:58.678 --> 34:00.014
Mm.

34:00.014 --> 34:02.018
Look at you surprising me.

34:03.353 --> 34:05.149
Don't let this girl
get spoiled, now.

34:05.149 --> 34:07.278
You don't want to live
that life, baby.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.157
‐ Yo, can I get a ride uptown?

34:09.157 --> 34:12.288
‐ Oh, I gotta go to work.

34:12.288 --> 34:13.916
What's going on?

34:13.916 --> 34:15.795
Hey, I need to pick up
something.

34:15.795 --> 34:18.676
And I ain't got time
to make it on the train.

34:18.676 --> 34:20.429
‐ Pick up what something?

34:22.141 --> 34:24.855
You ain't even got the money
for a re‐up.

34:24.855 --> 34:26.692
‐ The Dominicans will front me.

34:26.692 --> 34:28.277
‐
No.

34:28.277 --> 34:29.405
‐ No, come on, Nia,
I need this.

34:29.405 --> 34:30.909
‐ I said no.

34:30.909 --> 34:33.413
‐ Hey, the only reason
why you have this fucking car

34:33.413 --> 34:35.333
is because I was hustling
when you got laid off.

34:35.333 --> 34:38.800
Now, you would've had to sell
that shit, remember?

34:38.800 --> 34:42.264
‐ Yeah.
I remember.

34:42.264 --> 34:44.895
And I know I've been riding
with you for all these years,

34:44.895 --> 34:46.899
but I'm telling you
that I don't want none of this

34:46.899 --> 34:48.318
in my life no more.

34:48.318 --> 34:51.116
‐ All right.
I need it for my moms.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.546
‐ Divine.

34:57.546 --> 34:59.340
You know I love you.

35:01.344 --> 35:04.142
And I know you.

35:04.142 --> 35:06.479
That ain't what this is.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.152
Not really.

35:09.152 --> 35:13.118
Baby, you ain't got nobody
to prove yourself to.

35:13.118 --> 35:15.497
Okay, you'll figure out another
way to help your mother.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.430
‐ Hey, look.
Look.

35:23.430 --> 35:26.562
No, we need to go, huh?

35:26.562 --> 35:28.524
We need to go now.

35:31.321 --> 35:33.074
Come on, Nia.

35:33.074 --> 35:34.160
Nia, come on.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.329
Hey, Nia, Nia!
No!

35:35.329 --> 35:36.874
No, hey, Nia.
Please?

35:36.874 --> 35:38.168
Nia, come on.

35:38.168 --> 35:40.255
‐ If you want to go down
that road,

35:40.255 --> 35:42.636
I can't stop you.

35:42.636 --> 35:44.180
But you gonna have to go alone.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.558
‐ Hey.
‐ Let go.

35:45.558 --> 35:46.936
‐ Hey, Nia.

35:46.936 --> 35:49.106
Hey, Nia!
Come on!

35:53.908 --> 35:55.410
Fuck her.

36:20.795 --> 36:23.174
‐

36:38.204 --> 36:39.708
Hey, yo.

36:39.708 --> 36:41.336
What you got?

36:46.220 --> 36:48.224
‐ I got business.

36:49.143 --> 36:51.022
You think you're gonna be
a star and all that,

36:51.022 --> 36:53.151
so you out here
wasting your fucking time

36:53.151 --> 36:55.280
rhyming on some Memorex tape.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.869
Well, you got some
grown‐ass men that gotta

36:57.869 --> 37:00.123
get out here
and make this paper.

37:00.123 --> 37:02.796
‐ Yo, make sure you get this
down on paper.

37:17.659 --> 37:18.953
Pow!
There it is.

37:18.953 --> 37:21.332
I know I'm not
smelling weed up in here.

37:21.332 --> 37:22.711
Man, fuck that.

37:22.711 --> 37:24.589
Here we go.
Man, this is bullshit.

37:24.589 --> 37:26.467
‐ All right, y'all.
Let's get going.

37:26.467 --> 37:28.096
‐ We ain't even doing nothing,
son.

37:28.096 --> 37:29.348
‐ Don't try and play me.

37:29.348 --> 37:30.517
I grew up in this building.
You know that.

37:30.517 --> 37:32.229
‐ Yo, you might be
from Killa Hill,

37:32.229 --> 37:34.275
but you still a sucka, nigga.
‐ Yeah, you sucka.

37:34.275 --> 37:35.444
‐ Don't make me write
your asses up

37:35.444 --> 37:36.947
for loitering, because I will.

37:36.947 --> 37:38.909
‐ Whatever, whatever, son.

37:38.909 --> 37:40.913
‐ This guy's always hatin'.

37:40.913 --> 37:42.792
‐ Fuckin' Jake.

37:45.005 --> 37:47.384
‐
Shurrie.

37:47.384 --> 37:49.305
Baby, listen.

37:49.305 --> 37:50.975
‐ Shurrie is gone.

39:23.619 --> 39:25.247
‐ Fuck.

39:30.131 --> 39:31.635
‐ Twenty more seconds,
your ass would've been

39:31.635 --> 39:32.720
right back in the joint.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.557
‐ Twenty more seconds, man.

39:45.245 --> 39:48.418
I can't believe it.
I think I'm dreaming.

39:52.677 --> 39:55.056
You're always coming through,
Divine.

39:56.517 --> 39:59.106
‐ Pfft.
‐

39:59.106 --> 40:01.152
Whoo!
‐ Yeah.

40:01.152 --> 40:02.864
‐
‐ Yeah?

40:04.325 --> 40:07.957
‐ Whoa!
‐ Show me my room.

40:07.957 --> 40:10.211
‐ You want yours? Upstairs.
‐ Come on. Let's do it.

40:10.211 --> 40:11.840
‐ Upstairs.
‐

40:11.840 --> 40:13.552
‐ The queen bedroom.
Move out the way!

40:30.753 --> 40:32.214
Yo, 'Vine.

40:32.214 --> 40:33.884
Got you a Christmas present.

40:36.013 --> 40:38.560
Holidays bring out the fiends
like you're in a monster movie.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.105
Gotta keep 'em in line.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.529
‐

40:43.529 --> 40:45.115
‐ You done DJ'ing
today, nigga.

40:45.115 --> 40:46.576
I got this.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.125
‐ 'Vine, what you did
was big, man.

40:50.125 --> 40:52.588
How moms like it?

40:52.588 --> 40:54.634
‐ Loves it.
‐ Word.

40:54.634 --> 40:56.888
‐ They never seen
so much space.

40:56.888 --> 41:00.019
Their voices be echoing
when they talk to each other.

41:00.019 --> 41:01.648
‐

41:01.648 --> 41:03.777
Word up, man.

43:03.809 --> 43:05.311
Get on the line.
