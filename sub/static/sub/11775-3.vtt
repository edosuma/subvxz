Man:
I THINK WE'RE THE TEAM
TO BEAT. I REALLY DO.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.193
I REALLY THINK WE HAVE
A GREAT CHANCE THIS YEAR.

00:25.293 --> 00:28.396
- I AGREE.
- SO, UH, ARE YOU READY
TO GO? I GOTTA GO.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.431
- WHY?
- YOU'VE GOTTA GO?
TAKE IT EASY.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.500
NO, I'VE JUST GOTTA GET BACK.
I TOLD ILENE I'D BE BACK

00:32.600 --> 00:34.902
- AT A CERTAIN TIME.
- HOW DID I KNOW THAT?
"I TOLD ILENE.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.304
- I'VE GOTTA GET BACK."
- OKAY.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.571
ON THE WAY, WE'LL PICK UP
A NEW COCK FOR YOU, OKAY?

00:37.671 --> 00:39.873

00:42.210 --> 00:43.811
DINNER, BRING THE WIVES?

00:43.911 --> 00:46.147
- A PRE-TOURNAMENT DINNER.
I LIKE IT.
- Jeff: SURE.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.415
WHAT ABOUT FUNKHOUSER?
WILL YOU CALL HIM?

00:47.515 --> 00:49.317
I'LL CALL HIM.
HE'LL BE THERE TOMORROW.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.618
- OKAY.
- WHERE HAS HE BEEN?
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.786
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL HE'S DOING.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.089
- HE HASN'T PRACTICED FOR--
- LIKE A MONTH I HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM OUT HERE.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.757
- NO ONE'S SEEN HIM!
- WHAT DOES HE THINK?

00:56.857 --> 00:58.892
HE'S JUST GONNA COME
OUT HERE ON SATURDAY
AND PLAY GREAT?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.994
- I DON'T GET IT.
- Jeff: HE IS GREAT,
BUT IS HE THAT GREAT?

01:01.095 --> 01:02.730
- Eddie:
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.932

I'M SORRY, I GOTTA GO.

01:05.032 --> 01:07.101
- SEE YOU, GUYS.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.703
JEEZ. IS THERE ANYTHING
MORE PATHETIC

01:09.803 --> 01:12.440
THAN A COWERING,
EMASCULATED JEW WHO HAS
TO RUN HOME TO HIS WIFE?

01:12.540 --> 01:15.709
- I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU.
- THAT POOR FUCK.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.378
IMAGINE HOW HE'D BE
IF HE WAS MARRIED TO SUSIE.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.713
HE'D HAVE PEE STAINS
ON HIS PANTS CONSTANTLY.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.550
- HE'D BE
IN HER PURSE. YOU KNOW?
- HE'D BE IN HER PURSE.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.753
HE HAS NO BALLS.
I HAVE A SOLID SINGLE BALL.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.289
- YEAH, YOU'VE GOT ONE BALL.
- I'VE GOT ONE SOLID BALL.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.291
- HEY, LET'S GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.
- OKAY.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.561
UM, YOU WANT TO TRY OUT THAT
PALESTINIAN CHICKEN PLACE?

01:33.661 --> 01:36.063
LET'S DO IT.
THAT'S ALL I'VE EVER HEARD
IS HOW GREAT IT IS.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.498
FANTASTIC.
OKAY, LET'S GO.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.837
MMM, I'VE NEVER HAD
CHICKEN LIKE THIS.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.973
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL THEY'RE DOING.
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:46.073 --> 01:49.009
- IT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING
I'VE EVER EVEN TASTED.
- WHAT ABOUT THIS PLACE?

01:49.109 --> 01:52.012
LOOK AT
THESE POSTERS, HUH?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.714
Jeff:
YEAH, THEY DO NOT
LIKE THE JEWS.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.749
- LOOK AT THAT ONE.
- OOH.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.551
Larry:
WE'RE PROBABLY THE ONLY
JEWS EVER WALKED IN HERE.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.587
Jeff:
EVER. WHAT THESE
PEOPLE SHOULD DO

01:59.687 --> 02:01.422
IS SEND THEIR CHICKEN
OVER TO ISRAEL.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.257
- FOR THE PEACE PROCESS.
- MM-HMM.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.958
THEY'D TAKE DOWN
ALL THOSE SETTLEMENTS
IN THE MORNING.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.261
BELIEVE ME.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:07.361 --> 02:10.998
THIS WOULD BE
A FANTASTIC PLACE

02:11.098 --> 02:13.467
FOR JEWS WHO ARE
CHEATING ON THEIR SPOUSES

02:13.567 --> 02:15.303
- TO COME TO.
- OH YEAH.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.137
BECAUSE NO JEWS
EVER COME HERE.
THEY'D BE SO SAFE.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.572
NO ONE YOU KNOW IS
EVER GONNA SEE YOU HERE.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.209
- YOU WOULD NEVER
GET CAUGHT.
- EVER.

02:21.309 --> 02:24.278
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE PLANNING
THE NEXT INTIFADA

02:24.378 --> 02:26.046
AT THIS TABLE,
BUT LOOK AT THIS WOMAN.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.416
COULD BE
THE NEXT MRS. DAVID.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.418
- WHAT DO
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
- IF BY SOME CHANCE

02:30.518 --> 02:32.286
SHE'S GONNA GET OVER
HER ANTI-SEMITISM,

02:32.386 --> 02:34.255
- ODDS ARE NOT WITH YOU, NO.
- NOT WITH ME? REALLY?

02:34.355 --> 02:36.089
- JUST MY GUT FEELING.
- YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

02:36.190 --> 02:39.293
YOU'RE ALWAYS ATTRACTED
TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T
WANT YOU, RIGHT?

02:39.393 --> 02:41.295
- RIGHT.
- WELL, HERE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY

02:41.395 --> 02:42.596
WHO NOT ONLY
DOESN'T WANT YOU,

02:42.696 --> 02:45.266
DOESN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE
YOUR RIGHT TO EXIST...

02:45.366 --> 02:47.868
- EXIST, YUP.
- ...WANTS YOUR DESTRUCTION.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.404
THAT'S A TURN-ON.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.587
- ( crashes )
- OH MY GOD!

03:06.687 --> 03:08.456
( sighs )

03:10.991 --> 03:12.660
( tisks )

03:12.760 --> 03:15.128
SHE ALMOST TOOK
MY HEAD OFF, BUT I DON'T
LIKE THOSE TEACHERS.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.797
I DON'T. TURN THE BOYS
INTO GIRLS AND--

03:16.897 --> 03:19.099
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST.
- I HAVE TO SAY--

03:19.199 --> 03:20.501
- HEY!
- WELL WELL.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.271
- HEY. HELLO.
- WELCOME.

03:23.371 --> 03:26.039
- HELLO.
- OH MY GOD,
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

03:26.139 --> 03:28.175
- THANK YOU.
YES, I'M SERIOUS.
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

03:28.276 --> 03:30.210
- IT'S BEEN LIKE A YEAR
HE HASN'T SEEN ME.
- A LOT, I KNOW.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.580
- SHE LOST A LOT.
- ABOUT 60, 65 LBS.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.582
- Susie and Jeff: WOW.
- UNBELIEVABLE.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.384
- HOW'D YOU DO IT?
- I WALKED,

03:36.484 --> 03:39.353
I WATCH WHAT I EAT
AND DISCIPLINE.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.355
- A LOT OF CELERY.
- CELERY. JEFF, YOU HEAR THAT?

03:41.455 --> 03:43.657
- CELERY.
- YEAH, I HEARD CELERY.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.627
- I'M JUST SAYING.
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING?
YOU'RE JUST ANNOYING.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.563
- BY THE WAY, WHO'S GOT
THE SILVER LEXUS?
- RON, WHY?

03:49.663 --> 03:52.199
OH. HE'S NOT GONNA
LIKE IT.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.101
- Jeff: YOU HIT IT?
- I'M AFRAID SO.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.069
OH GOD,
HE JUST GOT THAT CAR.

03:56.169 --> 04:00.040
I'M SO STUPID.
I TRIED TO BACK UP
WITH MIRRORS ONLY.

04:00.140 --> 04:03.844
- WHY?
- I CHALLENGED MYSELF
TO JUST USE MIRRORS

04:03.944 --> 04:06.680
- AND IT DIDN'T WORK.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS,
THE FIRECRACKER 400?

04:06.780 --> 04:09.317
- IT'S A DRIVEWAY.
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
BREAK THE NEWS TO HIM.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.652
Eddie: ALL RIGHT.
HEY, FUNKHOUSER'S
IN THERE TOO.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.721
HE'S GOT A LITTLE
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.457
- HEY. HOW'S IT GOING?
- HEY, LARRY, HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO SEE YOU.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.058
- YEAH, HI.
- YOU REMEMBER MY WIFE
ILENE, RIGHT?

04:18.158 --> 04:19.660
- SURE, YEAH. HI.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.261
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT THE GOLF TOURNAMENT.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.697
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING
HIM TO PLAY IN IT.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.499
- UH-HUH.
- YEAH, NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.468
HEY, LISTEN,
I'M SORRY TO HAVE
TO TELL YOU THIS,

04:27.568 --> 04:30.638
BUT I-- I KINDA BANGED
INTO YOUR CAR.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.906
- HOW DID YOU HIT MY CAR?
- I BACKED INTO IT. I'M SORRY.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.875
- THAT'S MY NEW LEXUS.
- I KNOW. I'LL PAY FOR IT.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.744
HOW DID
HE HIT YOUR CAR?

04:36.844 --> 04:39.447
- RON, WHAT DID I SAY WHEN
WE DROVE INTO THE DRIVEWAY?
- I KNOW.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.615
"NOT ENOUGH SPACE.
IF YOU PARK THERE,
SOMEONE'S GONNA HIT YOU."

04:41.715 --> 04:43.451
YEAH, NO, IT'S MY--
IT'S MY FAULT.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.652
IT'S MY-- I'LL PAY
FOR THE WHOLE THING.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.454
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE
A LOOK AT IT.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.255
- OH GOD.
NEXT TIME WHEN I SAY...
- Ron: I KNOW.

04:48.356 --> 04:51.191
- ..."DON'T PARK THERE,"
LISTEN.
- Ron: OKAY.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.762
- SAMMI? HI.
- OH HEY, LARRY.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.599
- ( chuckles )
- SHALOM.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.167
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

05:00.267 --> 05:02.202
- WHAT?
- THE YARMULKE.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
I WENT THROUGH A BIT
OF A MIDLIFE CRISIS

05:04.405 --> 05:07.775
AND I REDEDICATED
MY LIFE TO JUDAISM.

05:07.875 --> 05:11.579
- ARE YOU FOR REAL?
- I HAD A LOT OF SCHPILKAS
IN MY LIFE

05:11.679 --> 05:15.182
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE IT.
I WENT TO RABBI STEIN.
DO YOU KNOW HER?

05:15.282 --> 05:17.351
- NO, I DON'T.
- PHENOMENAL.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.519
I GO THERE EVERY NIGHT.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.221
WE TALK.
SHE'S INVIGORATING ME.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.790
IS THAT WHY YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN PRACTICING?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.758
WE'RE DEPENDING ON YOU.
I HOPE YOU'VE GOT YOUR SWING.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.227
- I'M READY.
I'M ALWAYS READY.
- OH REALLY?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.962
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
COME BACK TO EARTH, HUH?

05:29.062 --> 05:32.433
I'M LIVING
UNDER A MITZVAH.
YOU HAVE NONE OF THAT.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.134
( softly )
HEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.637
WHAT THE HELL IS
SHE DOING HERE?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.472
Funkhouser:
WHY SHOULDN'T SHE BE HERE?

05:38.572 --> 05:41.141
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S A DINNER PARTY
FOR ADULTS.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.976
- HEY, DINNER'S UP.
- Larry: HEY.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.413
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:50.484 --> 05:53.387
AND SOME FABULOUS DESSERTS,
WHICH BY THE WAY

05:53.487 --> 05:55.389
I NEED YOU TO KEEP ME
AWAY FROM NO MATTER WHAT.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.791
- OKAY.
- YEAH, 'CAUSE I PUT
A LOT OF TIME INTO THIS.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.428

06:00.528 --> 06:02.930

06:03.030 --> 06:04.532

06:14.174 --> 06:15.208
- Larry: WHAT?

06:15.308 --> 06:17.010

- NO WAY. NO WAY.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.912
THAT'S ENOUGH.
COME ON. NO.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.849
- I'M HUNGRY.
- WELL, YOU CAN'T DRINK
THE WINE WITHOUT THE PRAYER.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.383
OH, YOU CAN'T?
REALLY? WATCH THIS.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.453

06:25.553 --> 06:26.854

06:26.954 --> 06:29.222
TO THE FIVE-MAN

06:29.322 --> 06:31.892

DO YOU KNOW THAT--

06:40.468 --> 06:42.169
IN WESTWOOD,
THE PALESTINIAN ONE?

06:42.269 --> 06:43.737
- AL-- WHAT IS IT CALLED?
- AL-ABBAS BEST ORIGINAL
CHICKEN.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.306
AL-ABBAS BEST
ORIGINAL CHICKEN.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.308
THEY'RE OPENING UP
A SECOND LOCATION

06:48.408 --> 06:50.578
RIGHT NEXT DOOR
TO GOLDBLATT'S DELI.

06:50.678 --> 06:54.081

06:56.550 --> 06:58.351
- L.O.L.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.053
Funkhouser:

07:00.153 --> 07:03.724
CAN THEY DARE
OPEN UP A PALESTINIAN
CHICKEN RESTAURANT

07:03.824 --> 07:05.659
NEXT TO THE SACRED LAND
OF THAT DELI?

07:05.759 --> 07:08.395
HEY, THIS IS AMERICA.
THEY CAN DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.130
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- Ilene: IT'S JUST CHICKEN.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.332
I MEAN, THEY CAN
LEGALLY DO IT, TRUE.
BUT SHOULD THEY?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.868
- YEAH, THEY SHOULD.
YEAH, THEY SHOULD.
- Ilene: EXACTLY.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.437
IT'S INSENSITIVE.
WHY CAN'T THEY OPEN IT
A FEW BLOCKS UPTOWN?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.306
THEY SHOULD MOVE IT
A MILE AWAY.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.241
I HEAR THE CHICKEN'S
REALLY GOOD, BY THE WAY.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.844

07:23.944 --> 07:27.080

AT THIS NEW LOCATION
THEY'RE TRYING TO OPEN.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.021
WE SHOULD ALL SHOW UP

07:58.512 --> 08:00.047
- LARRY, WHAT?
- Juliet: THEY'RE NOT--

08:00.147 --> 08:01.982
- THEY'RE NOT COLD.
- WHAT? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.685
- THE CHUTZPAH, MAN.
- DO YOU WANT ME TO WARM
THEM UP FOR YOU?

08:04.785 --> 08:07.454
NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.
HEY, I GOT A GOOD JOKE.

08:07.555 --> 08:10.357
THIS IS RIGHT UP
YOUR ALLEY, OKAY, FUNKMAN?

08:10.457 --> 08:13.727
A WOMAN GOES
TO A GYNECOLOGIST. HE SAYS,
"GET UP ON THE TABLE,

08:13.827 --> 08:16.129
PUT YOUR FEET IN THE STIRRUPS
AND SPREAD YOUR LEGS WIDE."

08:16.229 --> 08:19.432
HE GOES,
"MY GOD, MRS. JOHNSON,
YOU'VE GOT A BIG VAGINA."

08:19.533 --> 08:21.602
- WHOA WHOA WHOA! LARRY.
- ( Jeff laughs )

08:21.702 --> 08:25.005
- WHAT?
- SAMMI'S HERE, OKAY?

08:25.105 --> 08:26.940
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
IT'S JUST A LITTLE JOKE.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.210
- AHH.
- Funkhouser:
AND WHAT HAPPENS?

08:30.310 --> 08:32.279
EXCUSE ME.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.051
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU? TELLING A JOKE
LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF HER.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.754
WHAT ARE YOU
BRINGING YOUR DAUGHTER
TO AN ADULT DINNER PARTY FOR?

08:40.854 --> 08:43.023
SHE'S AN ADULT.
SHE CAN COME TO
AN ADULT DINNER PARTY.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.958
SHE'S AN ADULT?
IF SHE'S AN ADULT, WHY CAN'T
SHE HEAR A DIRTY JOKE?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.794
- THERE'S A LEVEL, OKAY?
- Larry: A LEVEL?

08:46.894 --> 08:49.062
- YEAH.
- OH, THERE'S A LEVEL
OF BEING AN ADULT?

08:49.162 --> 08:53.066
SHE'S AN ADULT WHEN
SHE TURNS 13 OR LEARNS
TO MAKE HER FIRST LATKES.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.236
- ( laughter )
- L.O.L.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.318
( chatting )

09:16.256 --> 09:17.625
( both laugh )

09:17.725 --> 09:19.226
- NO NO NO.
NO NO NO.
- HUH-UH-UH.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.595
- I'M JUST
GONNA HAVE A BITE.
- OH NO NO NO NO NO.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.363
- JUST A BITE. COME ON.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:23.463 --> 09:27.267
YOU TOLD ME
SPECIFICALLY NOT TO
LET YOU HAVE ANY DESSERT.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.402
I APPRECIATE IT, LARRY,
BUT I CHANGED MY MIND.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.171
AH! YES YES YES,

09:31.271 --> 09:34.407
- BUT YOU SAID
"NO MATTER WHAT," OKAY?
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:34.507 --> 09:37.410
I'M CHANGING IT,
AND NOW I'M SAYING
THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.980
- I'M GONNA HAVE SOME CAKE.
- NO NO, BUT YOU CAN'T
CHANGE IT.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.016
THAT'S WHY YOU SAY
"NO MATTER WHAT."
THIS IS THE WHAT.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.552
- BUT NOW--
- THAT'S WHY YOU ASKED ME
AND NOT THESE OTHER PEOPLE,

09:45.653 --> 09:48.622
- BECAUSE YOU KNEW
I WOULDN'T LET YOU.
- WHAT WHAT WHAT? LARRY.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.792
- GIVE ME THE CAKE!
- SHE TOLD ME NOT TO
LET HER HAVE IT, OKAY?

09:51.892 --> 09:54.194
SHE SAID,
"NO MATTER WHAT," OKAY?

09:54.294 --> 09:56.797
- LET HER HAVE IT! IT'S NONE
OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS!
- ( all shouting )

09:56.897 --> 09:58.766
GIVE ME
THE CAKE, LARRY!

09:58.866 --> 10:01.735
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU-- AH!

10:05.305 --> 10:07.675
Ron:
I GOT AN ESTIMATE
ON THE CAR.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.609
- $573?
- YEAH.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.745
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
FORGET THE INSURANCE.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.681
I'LL JUST WRITE YOU A CHECK.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.816
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT,

10:15.916 --> 10:18.819
BUT LET ME PROPOSE
AN ALTERNATIVE HERE.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.288
INDULGE ME FOR A SECOND.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.658
LAST NIGHT AT
THAT DINNER PARTY, YOU--
YOU REALLY IMPRESSED ME.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.427
- ( scoffs ) I DID?
- WELL, YOU JUST SPEAK
YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW?

10:27.527 --> 10:30.063
YOU TELL PEOPLE
HOW YOU'RE FEELING,
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING--

10:30.163 --> 10:32.265
WITH THE POTATOES,
FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.668
- HOW COLD WERE
THOSE POTATOES, BY THE WAY?
- THEY WERE FREEZING.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.971
I COULDN'T SAY THAT.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN
COME OUT WITH IT, YOU KNOW?

10:38.071 --> 10:39.773
AND THEN JEFF
AND SUSIE WITH THE KID.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.274
WHAT WAS THE KID
DOING THERE, RIGHT?

10:41.374 --> 10:43.476
WHY DO YOU BRING
YOUR DAUGHTER TO
AN ADULT DINNER PARTY?

10:43.576 --> 10:45.345
EXACTLY. YOU SAY WHAT
EVERYBODY'S THINKING.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.849
YOU JUST COME OUT WITH IT.
IT'S IMPRESSIVE, YOU KNOW?

10:48.949 --> 10:51.318
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THANK YOU.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.120
SO I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU NOTICED
THIS LAST NIGHT,

10:53.220 --> 10:55.588
BUT MY WIFE ILENE,
SHE SAYS "L.O.L."

10:55.689 --> 10:57.324
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU PICKED UP
ON THAT THAT.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.694
- OH, YES, I CERTAINLY DID
PICK UP ON THAT.
- YEAH?

11:00.794 --> 11:04.297
I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOU SAY
"L.O.L." INSTEAD OF JUST
LAUGHING AT SOMETHING?

11:04.397 --> 11:06.867
- WELL, JUST TELL
HER TO STOP SAYING IT.
- I CAN'T TELL HER THAT.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.069
SHE'LL KILL ME.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.938
WE'LL GET INTO A FIGHT,
IT'LL LAST FOR MONTHS.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.206
- SHE'S A TOUGH CUSTOMER.
- YES SHE-- YOU NOTICED THAT?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.275
SHE'S LIKE-- SHE'S LIKE
SUSIE'S TWIN SISTER.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.778
I KNOW. I'D JUST LIKE
TO AVOID THE WHOLE THING,

11:17.878 --> 11:19.546
AND I WAS
JUST WONDERING, MAYBE...

11:19.646 --> 11:22.249
YOU COULD SAY
IT TO HER, YOU KNOW?

11:22.349 --> 11:25.152
YOU KNOW?
YOU JUST PUT IT OUT THERE,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.354
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU DO THAT FOR ME,

11:27.454 --> 11:28.956
YOU SEE THIS ESTIMATE?

11:29.056 --> 11:31.024
( mimics rip )
GONE. I WILL TEAR IT UP.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.226
- I WILL PAY FOR IT MYSELF.
- LET ME SEE IF I'VE
GOT THIS RIGHT.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.428
- YEAH.
- I TELL HER TO STOP
SAYING "L.O.L."...

11:35.528 --> 11:38.631
- YES, IT'S ANNOYING. GONE.
- ...AND YOU TEAR UP THE BILL.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.267
- COME ON, PLEASE. DEAL.
- YEAH?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.736
- YEAH, YOU'VE GOT IT.
- IT'S A DEAL. THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.738
THIS IS-- OH, YOU'VE TAKEN
A LOAD OFF MY SHOULDERS,

11:44.838 --> 11:46.006
- LET ME TELL YOU.
- HI, LARRY.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.674
- Larry: HEY.
- HI, HONEY.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.142
HONEY, CAN YOU GET
THE REST OF THE BAGS?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.945
- YEAH YEAH YEAH,
I'LL GO GET 'EM.
- Larry: OKAY.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.482
GOD, THAT STORE WAS
SO CROWDED.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.752
- CROWDED?
- HOW ARE YOU?

11:58.852 --> 12:01.688
- NOT BAD.
- GOOD.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.490
I NOTICED YOU WERE
ALL ALONE AT THE PARTY.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.760
- OH, YOU DID NOTICE THAT?
- YEAH. ARE YOU DATING?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.896
- NO. NO.
- WHY NOT?

12:08.996 --> 12:11.198
( scoffs )
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.000
A DATE IS AN EXPERIENCE
YOU HAVE WITH ANOTHER PERSON

12:13.100 --> 12:16.303
- THAT MAKES YOU APPRECIATE
BEING ALONE.
- L.O.L.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.605
L.O.L.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.607
YOU-- YOU LIKE
SAYING THAT, DON'T YOU?

12:20.707 --> 12:22.342
IT'S CUTE, RIGHT?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.411
NO. NOT-- NOT REALLY.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.214
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I MEAN, IF YOU WERE
GONNA LAUGH OUT LOUD,

12:27.314 --> 12:29.682
WHY AREN'T YOU
LAUGHING OUT LOUD?
WHY SAY IT?

12:29.783 --> 12:31.451
- WHY NOT JUST LAUGH?
- I AM LAUGHING.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.954
THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.
IT'S ME-- THAT'S LAUGHING.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.123
NO, YOU'RE SAYING "L.O.L."
YOU'RE VERBAL TEXTING.

12:36.223 --> 12:40.127
EXCUSE ME,
IS THIS YOUR LITTLE IDEA?

12:40.227 --> 12:44.464
DID MY PISSANT HUSBAND
TELL YOU TO DO THIS?

12:44.564 --> 12:45.833
- NO.
- YES, HE DID.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.567
- Larry: NO, HE DID NOT.
- YES, HE DID.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.436
- HE DIDN'T!
- NO, YOU'RE IN MY HOUSE,

12:49.536 --> 12:52.105
MY KITCHEN, TELLING
ME HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO
RESPOND TO YOUR JOKES?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.941
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
I LEFT THE GATE OPEN.
- RON, ARE YOU FUCKING

12:54.041 --> 12:55.242
- OUT OF YOUR MIND?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:55.342 --> 12:57.177
DID YOU TELL HIM
TO COME OVER TO ME

12:57.277 --> 12:59.379
AND TELL ME HOW I SHOULD
STOP SAYING "L.O.L."?

12:59.479 --> 13:01.514
DID I TELL LARRY THAT?
OF COURSE I WOULDN'T
TELL LARRY THAT.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.251
- YES. OH YES, YOU WOULD.
- NO NO NO, HE'S THE GUY
WHO DOES THIS.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.486
Ilene:
AND YOU CARE
HOW I EXPRESS MYSELF?

13:06.586 --> 13:10.057
- I THINK THE WAY YOU EXPRESS
YOURSELF IS LIKE A CHILD.
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.526
HE SAID HE'D FORGET ABOUT
THE MONEY FOR THE CAR,

13:13.626 --> 13:16.063
WHICH IS $573,

13:16.163 --> 13:18.531
IF I TELL HER TO STOP
SAYING "L.O.L."

13:18.631 --> 13:20.200
YOU KNOW,
IN MOST COUNTRIES,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.135
YOU COULD GET
SOMEBODY KILLED FOR $573.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.571
I KNOW. BY THE WAY,
I WAS THIS CLOSE

13:24.671 --> 13:26.940
- TO TELLING HER
THE OTHER NIGHT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?

13:27.040 --> 13:29.943
- YOU'RE A SOCIAL ASSASSIN.
- JESUS.

13:30.043 --> 13:33.580
- I GUESS I AM, IN A WAY.
- YEAH. HOW'D IT GO?

13:33.680 --> 13:37.184
NOT TOO GOOD. AS SOON
AS I TOLD HER, SHE KNEW
RON HAD PUT ME UP TO IT,

13:37.284 --> 13:40.153
SHE STARTED SCREAMING
AT HIM AND I JUST-- I LEFT.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.455
- SO YOU BUNGLED THE HIT.
- WELL, I DIDN'T BUNGLE IT.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.357
- I DID WHAT
I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.
- NO NO, YOU BUNGLED THE HIT.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.493
- WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?
- SHE KNEW.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.795
- THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.
- IT IS. YOUR PERFORMANCE
WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.530
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT SOCIAL ASSASSINATION?

13:50.630 --> 13:52.799
- NOTHING!
- I'M THE ONE WHO NAMED YOU
A SOCIAL ASSASSIN!

13:52.900 --> 13:55.135
- AND WE DON'T WANT YOU HERE
AT THE AGENCY ANYMORE.
- ( both laugh )

13:55.235 --> 13:56.703
- OKAY.
- ( car approaches )

13:56.803 --> 13:58.138
- Jeff: ALL RIGHT, FINALLY.
- THERE HE IS.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.108
I CANNOT
BELIEVE WE TALKED HIM
INTO COMING HERE.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.311
- HE'S GONNA LOVE IT.
HE'S GONNA LOVE IT.
- YEAH, HUH.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.080
SHALOM. YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT ALL LAST NIGHT,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.849
IF RABIN CAN
BREAK BREAD WITH ARAFAT,

14:09.950 --> 14:13.586
I CAN HAVE CHICKEN AT
THIS ANTI-SEMITIC SHITHOLE.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.423
OKAY, THAT'S JUST
NOT GONNA WORK.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.958
- YEAH, THAT'S NO GOOD.
- WHAT'S NOT GONNA WORK?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.226
- THE YARMULKE.
- YEAH.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.461
I CAN'T GO IN
WEARING THIS YARMULKE?

14:21.561 --> 14:22.996
- NO.
- YOU'RE SHOVING IT
IN THEIR FACES.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.397
- LET'S GO IN.
- NO NO NO NO NO NO.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.366
- IT'S FAR TOO COCKY A MOVE.
- YEAH. YEAH.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.135
WHAT IS THIS,
THE RAID ON ENTEBBE?

14:28.235 --> 14:30.303
- LET'S JUST KIND OF
WALK IN CASUALLY.
- WHAT?

14:30.403 --> 14:32.973
- PROUD JEWS WEAR YARMULKES.
- YEAH. BE PROUD HERE
IN THE PARKING LOT.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.042
- STOP IT. JUST TAKE IT OFF.
- YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
PROUD IN THERE.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.809
- LET'S JUST
GO IN AND SIT DOWN.
- IT'S A COCKY MOVE.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.145
- TAKE IT OFF.
TAKE IT OFF.
- COME ON.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.646
- I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING--
- TAKE IT OFF.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.381
- DON'T YOU DARE GO AFTER--
- HUH? COME ON, TAKE IT--

14:41.481 --> 14:44.451
DON'T YOU REACH FOR THAT.
DON'T YOU EVER TOUCH THAT.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.254
- NO, DON'T EVER
GRAB MY YARMULKE.
- ( grunting )

14:47.354 --> 14:50.223
GIVE IT TO ME!
DON'T EVER GRAB
MY YARMULKE, EVER.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.860
HOW DARE YOU?!
DON'T EVER TOUCH
MY YARMULKE.

14:53.961 --> 14:56.429
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

14:56.529 --> 14:59.332
- WE'RE GONNA
GO EAT WITHOUT YOU.
- GOOD. WHO NEEDS YOU?

14:59.432 --> 15:02.335
- GET-- GET OUT OF HERE!
- ( chring )

15:10.043 --> 15:13.213
OH PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.150
OH. WELL, HELLO.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.653
- YOU'RE A JEW, YES?
- YES, I AM A JEW.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.157
A BIG JEW. BIG.

15:24.257 --> 15:28.128
A BIG JEW AND YOU STILL
TOLD HIM TO TAKE OFF
HIS JEW CAP.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.964
- YES, I DID.
- THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

15:31.064 --> 15:34.801
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- LABE.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.104
- LABE.
- SON OF NAT.

15:37.204 --> 15:40.307
- SON OF NAT.
- MY FRIENDS CALL ME LARRY.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.743
- I LIKE YOU.
- WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

15:43.843 --> 15:46.646
- UH, YOU'RE A JEW.
- EH.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.349
MY NAME IS SHARA.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.552
- SHARA.
- CALL ME.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.362
LET'S GET SOME CHICKEN.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.601
MMM.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.638
- HOW HAPPY ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
- I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
DINNER TONIGHT.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.574
IT'LL PALE IN COMPARISON.
HOW CAN YOU EVEN HAVE
MEALS AFTER THIS?

16:14.674 --> 16:17.244
- OH MY GOD.
- WHAT?

16:17.344 --> 16:20.047
Larry:
EDDIE AND ILENE
JUST WALKED IN.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.750
Jeff:
EDDIE AND ILENE?
HE'S CHEATING ON JULIET?

16:23.850 --> 16:27.354
- HOLY SHIT.
- OH MY GOD!

16:27.454 --> 16:28.988
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.324
JULIET IS GREAT FRIENDS
WITH SUSIE.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.859
IF HE'S CHEATING ON JULIET,
I CAN'T BE HERE TO SEE IT.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.294
- WHAT?
- I AM OUT OF HERE.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.129
- WHAT THE HELL AM I GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.664
- YOU'RE TAKING THE CHICKEN?
- YES, OF COURSE.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.366
WHAT, I'M GONNA
LEAVE IT?

16:51.711 --> 16:54.081
- HEY.
- HEY. HI.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.217
( mimics Humphrey Bogart )
OUT OF ALL THE HUMMUS JOINTS
IN ALL THE WORLD,

16:57.317 --> 16:59.352
- YOU HAD TO WALK INTO MINE.
- ( both laugh )

16:59.452 --> 17:01.821
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.
AND LET ME JUST SAY

17:01.921 --> 17:04.191
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE BROWNIE THING
THE OTHER NIGHT WITH JULIET.

17:04.291 --> 17:07.527
- NO HARD FEELINGS.
- YOU KNOW, SHE DID SAY

17:07.627 --> 17:09.662
- "NO MATTER WHAT."
- YEAH YEAH YEAH, I--

17:09.762 --> 17:11.098
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

17:11.198 --> 17:13.633
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS, ALL RIGHT?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.568
- ( chuckles )
- NO, DON'T-- DON'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.937
- DON'T-- DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.
- ALL RIGHT?

17:18.037 --> 17:21.374
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE ONLY REASON WE'RE
HERE TOGETHER NOW

17:21.474 --> 17:24.311
IS BECAUSE
SHE HAD A BIG FIGHT
WITH RON, OKAY?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.546
SO SHE REACHED OUT
AS A FRIEND.

17:26.646 --> 17:30.617
YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS LIKED
EACH OTHER AND NOW WE LIKE
EACH OTHER A LITTLE MORE.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.319
MAYBE A LOT MORE.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.222
SO THE TWO
OF YOU GOT TOGETHER
BECAUSE OF THIS ARGUMENT?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.124
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A LOT OF TENSION THERE,

17:37.224 --> 17:39.726
BUT LET'S JUST SAY
THIS WAS THE STRAW THAT
BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK.

17:39.826 --> 17:43.163
- I GUESS
I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT HERE.
- WHAT WAS THE ARGUMENT ABOUT?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.964
HE DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY
SHE KEEPS SAYING "L.O.L."

17:45.064 --> 17:47.534
IT'S A WONDERFUL THING TO SAY.
I LOVE WHEN SHE SAYS "L.O.L."

17:47.634 --> 17:49.669
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
WE'RE TOGETHER. I THINK
IT'S COOL, IT'S FUNNY.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.138
I THINK IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SLEEP WITH HER,

17:51.238 --> 17:52.805
YOU WOULDN'T BE
SO TOLERANT OF THAT "L.O.L."

17:52.905 --> 17:56.243
WELL, THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,
BUT LOOK, IF RON FINDS OUT,

17:56.343 --> 17:58.278
THIS COULD BE VERY AWKWARD.
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY

17:58.378 --> 17:59.812
ON THE SAME TEAM
AND THEN WE WON'T WIN
THE TOURNAMENT.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.748
IF ANYONE QUITS,
WE'RE DISQUALIFIED.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.950
- OKAY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'M NOT GONNA SAY A WORD.
- ALL RIGHT.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.985
- OKAY.
- PROMISE.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.720
IN OTHER WORDS,
NO MATTER WHAT?

18:07.820 --> 18:10.056
- HUH?
- NO MATTER WHAT.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.459
BY THE WAY,
YOUR LUNCH IS ON ME.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.861
- I ALREADY PAID FOR IT.
- EVEN BETTER.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.900
Larry:
SO THEN HE TELLS ME
THE ONLY REASON

18:21.000 --> 18:22.669
THAT THEY'RE HAVING
THIS AFFAIR

18:22.769 --> 18:25.505
WAS BECAUSE
OF THE "L.O.L." THING.
I DROVE HER TO IT.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.208
WELL, I'M SURE THERE
WAS OTHER THINGS THAT
DROVE HER TO IT TOO.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.910
NO, I WAS THE STRAW
THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK.

18:31.010 --> 18:34.046
- ALL MARRIAGES HAVE STRAWS.
- RIGHT, THE CAMEL'S CARRYING
A LOT OF STRAW.

18:34.147 --> 18:37.250
- THAT'S WHAT A MARRIAGE IS.
- "L.O.L." WAS THE FINAL STRAW.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.519
- "L.O.L." WAS
THE FINAL STRAW, YES.
- WOW.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.755
I'VE GOTTA BE CAREFUL
WITH THIS WHOLE SOCIAL-
ASSASSINATION THING.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.525
- I'M NOT TAKING
ANY MORE REQUESTS.
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.027
IF RON FINDS OUT
ABOUT EDDIE AND ILENE,

18:48.127 --> 18:49.929
- TOURNAMENT OVER. DONE.
- NO GOLF.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.998
- RON'S NOT GONNA
PLAY ON THIS TEAM...
- Jeff: NOT A CHANCE.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.734
- ...IF HE'S HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH HIS WIFE.
- Jeff: NO WAY.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.036
HEY, NICE PILLOW.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.872
- YEAH, UM--
- YOU LOOK LIKE BLOFELD.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.442
I LOOK LIKE
I'VE GOT A KITTY

19:02.542 --> 19:04.844
AND WE'RE MAKING
EVIL PLANS.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.314
HERE, JUST PUT IT
ON YOUR LAP.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.784
( car alarm chirps )

19:11.884 --> 19:15.388
LARRY, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.124
I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE JOKE.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.493
- IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT--
- I-- I DIDN'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT THE JOKE.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.362
THAT'S NOT WHY
I GOT UP AND LEFT.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.197
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.499
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED OR NOT,

19:26.599 --> 19:29.035
EVERY TIME
AFTER MY MOM TAKES
A SIP OF SOMETHING,

19:29.135 --> 19:31.238
SHE MAKES THIS
REALLY OBNOXIOUS SOUND.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.573
SHE SMACKS HER LIPS TOGETHER
AND DOES THIS LITTLE

19:33.673 --> 19:34.874
"AHH" THING.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.243
- HUH.
- HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT?

19:36.343 --> 19:37.810
- I HAVE NOTICED, YEAH.
- IT'S AWFUL.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.879
- "AHH." RIGHT?
ISN'T THAT IT?
- IT'S HORRIBLE.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.849
IT'S HUMILIATING.
ALL OF MY FRIENDS MAKE FUN
OF ME IN THE MORNING

19:42.949 --> 19:46.319
WHEN SHE DROPS ME OFF.
I JUST-- I CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.455
SOMEONE HAS TO
TELL HER TO STOP
AND IT HAS TO BE YOU,

19:48.555 --> 19:50.189
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN STAND UP TO HER.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.791
LOOK, I'M FLATTERED, KID,

19:51.891 --> 19:54.927
THAT YOU WOULD
CONSIDER ME FOR SUCH
A DELICATE ASSIGNMENT,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.029
BUT I HAVE
TO TELL YOU I'M--

19:57.129 --> 19:59.366
( tisks )
I'M OUT OF THAT BUSINESS.

19:59.466 --> 20:02.235
- ASK YOUR FATHER, HE'LL DO IT.
- MY DAD IS SPINELESS.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.936
HE CAN'T STAND UP TO HER.
HE'S SCARED OF HER.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.872
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN DO IT.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.074
AS TEMPTING
AS IT IS, KID,

20:08.174 --> 20:11.210
I'M NOT YOUR MAN.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.380
BUT YOU-- BUT YOU--

20:19.319 --> 20:23.790
SO I GUESS YOU WON'T BE
PLAYING GOLF ON SATURDAY.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.492
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I COULDN'T HELP

20:25.592 --> 20:27.527
BUT OVERHEAR SOME
OF THE CONVERSATION
YOU WERE HAVING

20:27.627 --> 20:32.332
WITH MY DAD. AND IT SEEMS
IF RON WERE TO FIND OUT
ABOUT HIS WIFE,

20:32.432 --> 20:35.502
THEN YOUR LITTLE GOLF GAME
WOULD BE CALLED OFF.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.906
- YOU WOULD DO THAT?
- TRY ME.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.411
- ALL RIGHT.
- SO YOU'RE GONNA
TALK TO MY MOM?

20:44.511 --> 20:47.547
- I'LL TALK TO YOUR MOM.
- GOOD.

20:47.647 --> 20:51.484
BOY, YOU REALLY ARE
YOUR MOTHER'S DAUGHTER,
AREN'T YOU?

20:51.584 --> 20:55.355
YEAH, NOW GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY,
YOU BALD PRICK.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.061
FUCK ME,
YOU FUCKING JEW!

21:02.161 --> 21:03.663
- ( moaning )
- FILTHY JEW.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.998
- FILTHY JEW.
- FILTHY FUCKING JEW!

21:06.098 --> 21:08.601
YOU ZIONIST PIG.
YOU OCCUPYING FUCK.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.438
- OCCUPY THIS. YEAH.
- YEAH, I'M AN OCCUPIER.
I'M AN OCCUPIER.

21:11.538 --> 21:14.206
I'M GOING TO FUCK
THE JEW OUT OF YOU.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.242
- YEAH.
- WELL, THAT'S NOT SO EASY.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.346
YOU WANT TO FUCK ME
LIKE ISRAEL FUCKED MY COUNTRY?

21:19.446 --> 21:23.416
- SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT!
- THIS REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING
THEODOR HERZL ONCE SAID.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.285
- SHALOM, L.D.
- ( Shara moaning )

21:29.288 --> 21:32.492
YEAH, TAKE IT, JEW.
TAKE IT, JEW.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.593
OH!

21:33.693 --> 21:36.329
FUCK ME,
YOU JEW BASTARD!

21:36.429 --> 21:40.066
FUCK ME LIKE
ISRAEL FUCKS MY PEOPLE!

21:40.166 --> 21:41.768
SHOW ME
THE PROMISED LAND, HUH?

21:41.868 --> 21:43.736
LABE, SON OF NAT.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.105
KEEP MY FATHER
OUT OF IT, WILL YOU?

21:46.205 --> 21:49.976
- YOU CIRCUMCISED FUCK.
- OH! OH!

21:50.076 --> 21:52.712
Larry:
"WE SEEK HIM HERE,
WE SEEK HIM THERE,

21:52.812 --> 21:55.382
THOSE FRENCHIES
SEEK HIM EVERYWHERE,

21:55.482 --> 21:59.085
IS HE IN HEAVEN,
IS HE IN HELL?

21:59.185 --> 22:04.090
THAT DAMNED
ELUSIVE PIMPERNEL."

22:05.324 --> 22:09.161
FUNKMAN.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

22:09.261 --> 22:11.998
WELL WELL.

22:12.098 --> 22:15.768
MARTIN, SHARA.

22:15.868 --> 22:19.539
SHARA, MARTIN.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.343
ALL RIGHT THEN.
SHALL WE?

22:24.444 --> 22:26.178
( door opens )

22:26.278 --> 22:28.114
GOOD NIGHT.

22:35.321 --> 22:38.157
- PROBLEM?
- "FUCK ME, JEW BASTARD"?

22:38.257 --> 22:40.727
YEAH, SMALL PRICE TO PAY

22:40.827 --> 22:44.464
FOR THE BEST SEX
I'VE EVER HAD ANYWHERE.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.032
THIS WOMAN IS AMAZING.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.600
WHEN DID YOU HAVE
YOUR ORGASM?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.802
WHEN SHE SAID SHE'D FUCK
THE JEW OUT OF YOU?

22:49.902 --> 22:52.472
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THE PENIS DOESN'T CARE

22:52.572 --> 22:54.874
ABOUT RACE,
CREED AND COLOR.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.243
THE PENIS WANTS
TO GET TO HIS HOMELAND.

22:57.343 --> 22:58.645
IT WANTS TO GO HOME.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.047
I CAME OVER HERE
FOR ANOTHER REASON.

23:01.147 --> 23:04.216
RABBI STEIN SAID
THAT I CAN'T PLAY

23:04.316 --> 23:08.521
IN THE GOLF TOURNAMENT
SATURDAY BECAUSE I HAVE
TO HONOR THE SABBATH.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.856
YOU'RE KOUFAXING US?

23:09.956 --> 23:12.258
WELL, IF YOU'RE SAYING
THAT YOUR BEST PLAYER

23:12.358 --> 23:15.628
IS UNABLE TO PLAY
BECAUSE IT'S THE SABBATH,
YES, I'M KOUFAXING YOU.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.530
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET SOMEONE ELSE.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.666
THE TOURNAMENT WON'T
LET US GET ANYBODY ELSE,

23:19.766 --> 23:22.469
AND IF YOU DON'T PLAY,
WE ALL DROP OUT.
IT'S OVER FOR US.

23:22.569 --> 23:26.138
I'M FOLLOWING HER LEAD.
SHE TOLD ME WHAT
I HAVE TO DO.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.108
- I CAN'T PLAY.
- WHAT IF I TALKED
TO THE RABBI?

23:29.208 --> 23:31.277
I'D LOVE YOU TO.
SHE'S IN THE VALLEY
OFF OF BROOKHURST.

23:31.377 --> 23:34.113
AND IF SHE GIVES THE OKAY,
WOULD YOU PLAY?

23:34.213 --> 23:36.148
I'LL BE THERE.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.752
OUR FRIENDSHIP IS
ABOUT THAT MUCH NOW.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.021
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT!
IF YOU YOU DON'T PLAY
IN THAT GOLF TOURNAMENT,

23:42.121 --> 23:45.692
- IT'S OVER! HOW ABOUT THAT?!
- WHY DON'T YOU GO WRAP
YOUR HEAD IN A TOWEL?

23:45.792 --> 23:47.293
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
A MAN ANYMORE!

23:47.393 --> 23:50.930
MOMMY RABBI SAYS
DON'T PLAY, LITTLE BOY!

23:51.030 --> 23:52.465
DON'T YOU TELL ME
TO GET OUT OF YOUR--

23:52.565 --> 23:55.034
HEY, YOU DROPPED
YOUR YARMULKE!

23:55.134 --> 23:57.637
OH MY GOD!
YARMULKE ALERT!

23:57.737 --> 24:02.074
OH! SIRENS!
YARMULKE ON THE FLOOR! OH!

24:14.220 --> 24:17.189
( slurps ) MMM.

24:20.159 --> 24:23.496
- CAN I HAVE THE WEINSTEIN FILE?
- OH, I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.632
AND LARRY DAVID'S HERE.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.835
- COME ON IN.
- OH, WELL, I CAME
A LITTLE EARLY.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.670
- I WAS GONNA
FINISH MY LUNCH.
- WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

24:30.770 --> 24:33.506
- YOU CAN FINISH
IN MY OFFICE.
- OKAY.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.543
IS THAT AL-ABBAS CHICKEN?

24:36.643 --> 24:40.079
OH. YEAH.
FANTASTIC.

24:43.082 --> 24:46.418
- THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS.
- YEAH. YOU DON'T MIND?

24:46.519 --> 24:49.989
- YOU'RE SURE
YOU DON'T MIND? HUH?
- NO. NO NO, FINISH YOUR LUNCH.

24:50.089 --> 24:54.226
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
WE HAVE OUR PROBLEMS
WITH THESE PEOPLE

24:54.326 --> 24:58.430
BUT, MAN, OH MAN,
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
DOING CHICKENWISE.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.766
WELL, KEEP THAT AWAY
FROM ME NO MATTER WHAT.

24:59.866 --> 25:03.002
- ( chuckles )
- OKAY.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.945
- GIVE IT TO ME!
- YOU SAID, "NO MATTER WHAT"!

25:13.045 --> 25:16.082
- GIVE ME THAT!
GIVE ME THAT!
- RABBI! NO, LET GO!

25:19.185 --> 25:21.053
- WE ARE PLAYING SO GREAT.
- I'M HAVING A BLAST.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.922
- ARE YOU? HUH?
- I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER PLAYED BETTER.

25:23.022 --> 25:26.025
- YOU HAVEN'T MISSED A FAIRWAY.
- HEY, I'M TIRED OF ASKING.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.960
HOW DID YOU GET
THE RABBI TO LET ME PLAY?

25:28.060 --> 25:30.997
- I CAN'T TELL YOU.
- NO, PLEASE TELL ME.

25:31.097 --> 25:35.334
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST
SAY I HAD SOMETHING
SHE REALLY WANTED.

25:35.434 --> 25:37.036
YOU MADE A TRADE
WITH THE RABBI?

25:37.136 --> 25:39.572
- YEAH, I MADE A TRADE.
- WELL, I'M GLAD YOU DID.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.908
HEY, I JUST FOUND OUT
THE KLEIN TEAM BLEW UP.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.776
WE'RE FOUR STROKES AHEAD
AFTER THIS HOLE.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.511
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
FINISH ON 18 AND WE WIN.

25:45.612 --> 25:47.980
- IT'S A LOCK.
- FANTASTIC!

25:48.080 --> 25:50.650
- IT'S A LOCK.
- WE'RE GONNA WIN
A TOURNAMENT.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.051
WE'RE GONNA WIN
A TOURNAMENT.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.587
- COME ON, LARRY.
- Jeff: LET'S GO, DADDY-O.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.923
- Funkhouser: NO PRESSURE, L.D.
ALL WE NEED IS A TWO-PUTT.
- Ron: COME ON, LARRY.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.191
- JEFF.
- Funkhouser:
LET'S GET TO 18.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.596
- OKAY.
- Funkhouser:
INSIDE LEFT, L.D.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.665
- RELAX.
- Ron: TAKE IT.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.337
AHH.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.480
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:21.580 --> 26:23.415
- ONE SECOND, ONE SECOND,
ONE SECOND.
- LARRY.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.718
- Funkhouser:
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WHAT?

26:25.818 --> 26:27.754
I GOTTA TELL YOU
SOMETHING. YOU KNOW,

26:27.854 --> 26:30.089
EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A SIP...

26:30.189 --> 26:32.725
- YEAH?
- ...YOU MAKE
THIS NOISE-- "AHH."

26:32.825 --> 26:36.062
- I'M ENJOYING IT.
- EH. IT'S KINDA ANNOYING.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.330
- WHY ARE YOU
SAYING THIS TO ME?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.399
- JEFF DIDN'T PUT
YOU UP TO THIS?
- WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?

26:40.499 --> 26:42.434
- OF COURSE NOT.
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT JUST
GONNA INTERRUPT YOUR SHOT

26:42.534 --> 26:45.071
