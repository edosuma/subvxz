(Laughter)

00:51.385 --> 00:52.386
I need to find...

00:52.386 --> 00:54.805
Huh? Hey!

00:58.392 --> 01:01.311
‐ Hey, come on! Start!
‐ We want it now!

01:02.604 --> 01:04.982
OMG. Why is this taking forever?

01:04.982 --> 01:06.358
Yeah.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.945
‐ BOTH: Boo!
‐ We want the show! Guys!

01:09.945 --> 01:13.782
Ha! Sounds like the crowd's
ready to "rock" as the kids say.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.784
‐ Ha, ha! You're on!
‐ Yes!

01:15.784 --> 01:17.911
Wait. What?
Drake was supposed to be first.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.372
My guitar's outta tune.
No idea why.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.547
This is our ticket to stardom,
sis!

01:28.547 --> 01:31.967
And, this time, no superhero
masks to hide who we are!

01:31.967 --> 01:35.554
Well,
I'm only playing for Charlie.

01:35.554 --> 01:36.847
‐ Hurry up!
‐ Hop, hop!

01:36.847 --> 01:39.266
Your fans can't wait.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.477
(Clamour)

01:49.192 --> 01:51.653
Let's kick out the jams,
New York!

02:01.038 --> 02:02.164
(Nervous sounds)

02:03.790 --> 02:05.625
Liv, that's your cue!

02:05.625 --> 02:06.585
Liv...

02:07.044 --> 02:08.962
‐ (Hits wrong notes)
‐ No!

02:08.962 --> 02:11.048
‐ Lame.
‐ Heh, heh!

02:11.048 --> 02:13.383
Just a little pre‐show tuning.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.969
So, as I was, er, saying,

02:15.969 --> 02:17.554
are you ready to rock?

02:17.554 --> 02:19.056
(Cheering)

02:19.473 --> 02:22.684
‐ It's no big, just breathe!
‐ I got this.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.479
Except for the shaking hands,
which are real annoying.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.529
(Terrible noise, twice)

02:34.529 --> 02:35.697
Boo!

02:36.615 --> 02:39.660
Wow, her music's even lousier
than her personality.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.503
‐ Boo!
‐ Come on!

02:49.503 --> 02:52.214
So, uh...
you guys like stand‐up?

02:53.548 --> 02:54.800
Liv!

02:56.218 --> 03:00.138
‐ Oh! Did they finish already?
‐ Humph! Basic Bakers.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.474
‐ I found this!
‐ Are you kidding me?

03:02.474 --> 03:04.518
That's all
that was left backstage!

03:05.644 --> 03:08.939
(Sighs) Well, I can't be any
lousier than those Boo‐Bozos.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.107
Ha, ha!

03:10.107 --> 03:12.359
Whoa!

03:15.487 --> 03:17.239
Aaah!

03:19.157 --> 03:21.451
Mastaar!

03:21.451 --> 03:22.994
BOYS: Mastaar!

03:26.289 --> 03:28.875
So why'd the kid end up in jail
for not taking his nap?

03:29.709 --> 03:30.794
Ahem!

03:31.837 --> 03:36.591
For resisting a rest!
Get it? Arrest?

03:36.883 --> 03:38.760
‐ Aaah!
‐ Aw, come on,

03:38.760 --> 03:40.053
it's not that bad.

03:40.053 --> 03:44.307
(Shrieking)

03:45.600 --> 03:48.186
Mastaar! Mastaar! Mastaar!

03:52.983 --> 03:55.068
Liv! Liv! Wait!

03:56.903 --> 03:59.656
I don't get it, I couldn't
even play a single riff.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.576
It's like my fingers
were sausages.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.703
It's just stage fright,
that's all.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.455
I've never had that before!

04:06.455 --> 04:08.999
You've never played
in front of a big audience.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.959
Just play
like no one's watching,

04:10.959 --> 04:13.044
and you'll blow 'em away.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.757
Glowboo?

04:17.757 --> 04:21.470
Liv, Mike, insert
these ghost‐buds into your ears.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.805
‐ What? Why?
‐ Miss Jones' orders.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.224
(Gasps)

04:30.604 --> 04:33.356
Mastaar! Mastaar! Mastaar!

04:35.650 --> 04:37.068
(Ghost laughs)

04:41.656 --> 04:43.033
(Deeper laugh)

04:47.871 --> 04:48.955
(Laughter)

04:57.756 --> 04:58.465
Aaah!

05:03.720 --> 05:06.181
‐ Andy!
‐ Let's go, Ghost Force!

05:07.015 --> 05:09.518
<i>Ghost Force!</i>
<i>Don't fear the glow!</i>

05:14.314 --> 05:15.857
Krush!

05:17.025 --> 05:18.401
Myst!

05:20.821 --> 05:21.822
Ghost Force!

05:23.031 --> 05:24.574
Aw, man, you rock!

05:26.993 --> 05:29.246
Yeah! Good timing, huh?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.122
You'd already be
under Mastaar's spell

05:31.122 --> 05:32.999
without my ghost‐buds!

05:32.999 --> 05:35.961
This ghost
is a level‐7 mesmeriser.

05:35.961 --> 05:39.381
The more fans it mesmerizes
with its screeching... I mean,

05:39.381 --> 05:42.008
music,
the more powerful it becomes.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.344
So let's can the music,
shall we?

05:44.344 --> 05:47.681
‐ OK, but how?
‐ Um, no idea.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.349
I mean, I did catch one once,

05:49.349 --> 05:52.227
but I don't know what it can do
in booster mode.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.020
So, good luck!

05:54.020 --> 05:55.647
Well, that was helpful.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.439
‐ (Guitar)
‐ (Gasps)

06:01.945 --> 06:03.363
Mastaar! Mastaar!

06:03.780 --> 06:05.115
(Evil laugh)

06:06.700 --> 06:08.326
We gotta find Andy!

06:08.326 --> 06:10.579
Considering Andy's proximity
to the ghost,

06:10.579 --> 06:14.457
the probability that he was
mesmerised is... 95.3%.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.085
But still not a 100!
You guys handle the ghost,

06:17.085 --> 06:18.503
I'll go check on my bro.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.675
We must stop it playing
before it gets too strong!

06:23.675 --> 06:26.511
Affirmative,
let us end this noise pollution.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.976
Eyes up!

06:32.976 --> 06:34.853
Mastaar!

06:37.147 --> 06:39.316
Oh, great! That's all we need!

06:39.316 --> 06:40.859
Uh‐oh!

06:40.859 --> 06:42.611
‐ (Evil laugh)
‐ Fractal Power!

06:49.492 --> 06:51.036
‐ Hurry, Glowboo!
‐ Affirmative.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.039
‐ Mastaar!
‐ Hands off our hero!

06:55.624 --> 06:57.792
Oh, no!
Even when he's not playing,

06:57.792 --> 06:59.794
people are still
under its spell!

07:08.428 --> 07:10.930
‐ No!
‐ Mastaar! Mastaar!

07:10.930 --> 07:12.474
Mastaar! Mastaar!

07:13.767 --> 07:15.435
(Evil laugh)

07:19.356 --> 07:21.983
(Cheering)

07:21.983 --> 07:24.819
Mastaar! Mastaar! Mastaar!

07:26.404 --> 07:28.448
‐ Mastaar! Mastaar!
‐ Andy!

07:28.448 --> 07:31.159
(Chanting continues)

07:31.826 --> 07:33.828
Andy, quick, put these in,
we gotta ‐‐

07:33.828 --> 07:36.081
Mastaar! Mastaar!

07:36.081 --> 07:38.792
‐ Oh, no!
‐ Mastaar! Mastaar!

07:38.792 --> 07:41.127
Don't worry, bro,
I'll snap you out of it somehow.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.391
Oh, no!

07:54.391 --> 07:55.850
Yes!

07:57.727 --> 07:58.728
Did you find Andy?

07:59.938 --> 08:02.315
Glowboo was right. Mastaar
turned him into a total fanboy.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.651
This just got personal.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.071
We tried stopping its big solo,
but it's too strong.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.241
The louder it plays, the more
people it mesmerises with music.

08:13.076 --> 08:16.871
That's it! The ghost gets
its power from its audience.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.499
So what if we play even louder
and better than Mastaar?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.418
You mean, steal his audience!

08:21.835 --> 08:23.294
Only you can do it!

08:25.171 --> 08:26.256
Aaah!

08:27.006 --> 08:29.092
Krush! Oh, no!

08:39.978 --> 08:42.647
‐ Miss Jones? Do you read me?
‐ Clear as day, kiddo.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.692
You wouldn't have a
spectral‐sound amplifier handy?

08:45.692 --> 08:48.945
I'm sure I can dig something up!
Initiating transfer!

08:54.868 --> 08:58.038
Oh! I was hoping
for something a little bigger.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.583
Nnn‐nnn. Don't judge
an amplifier by its cover.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.669
Trust me, that thing is da bomb!

09:10.592 --> 09:14.804
Mastaar! Mastaar!
Mastaar! Mastaar!

09:24.856 --> 09:25.982
OK, time for Booshow!

09:27.233 --> 09:31.279
Mastaar! Mastaar!
Mastaar! Mastaar!

09:38.369 --> 09:40.121
Mastaar!

09:43.041 --> 09:44.334
Mast ‐‐

09:44.334 --> 09:45.794
‐ Huh? What?
‐ Andy!

09:47.045 --> 09:49.589
‐ Myst?
‐ Mastaar! Mastaar!

09:56.930 --> 10:01.101
Mastaar! Mastaar!
Mastaar! Mastaar!

10:07.148 --> 10:09.025
Myst! Myst! Myst! Myst!

10:09.359 --> 10:12.028
Myst! Myst! Myst! Myst!

10:24.040 --> 10:26.000
And that's how it's done!

10:26.000 --> 10:27.502
Yeah, Myst!

10:27.502 --> 10:29.504
Myst! Myst! Myst! Myst!

10:35.009 --> 10:35.718
Huh?

10:39.931 --> 10:40.974
Optika!

11:15.300 --> 11:18.761
(Cheering)

11:18.761 --> 11:23.308
Nice work, kids! And who
knew you were such a rock star?

11:23.308 --> 11:26.352
I'm good on the triangle. Hey,
we should go on tour one day!

11:26.352 --> 11:28.354
You mean when I'm not busy
saving New York?

11:30.440 --> 11:31.399
‐ Boo‐ya!
‐ Boo‐ya!

11:31.399 --> 11:33.526
I wholeheartedly concur.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.488
‐ (Laughter)
‐ (Cheering)

11:41.451 --> 11:43.494
Shame that ghost
stole my thunder.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.079
It was lamer than Liv!

11:45.079 --> 11:47.165
Aaah!

11:47.165 --> 11:49.292
Hello, New York!

11:49.292 --> 11:51.419
After some minor
spectral difficulties,

11:51.419 --> 11:53.796
the Boo Fighters are back!

11:53.796 --> 11:57.884
‐ So who's ready to rock?
‐ (Cheering)

12:18.196 --> 12:19.614
(Muttering to himself)

12:24.452 --> 12:25.495
Aaah!

12:26.329 --> 12:29.040
‐ Woof!
‐ Ah, there!

12:31.042 --> 12:33.836
‐ Everything's ready for class.
‐ Woof! Woof!

12:33.836 --> 12:36.965
The students are going to love
today's workshop, eh, Asta?

12:36.965 --> 12:38.216
Woof!

12:49.269 --> 12:52.313
Today's subject is one
I've wanted to cover for ages.

12:52.730 --> 12:56.859
‐ Spiders are fascinating...
‐ Coochie‐coochie‐coo!

12:56.859 --> 13:00.363
..would love a pet spider,
but Asta strongly disagrees.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.739
(Growls)

13:02.407 --> 13:05.952
They trap their prey
in ultra‐strong silk webs.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.538
Some species
even collect several prey,

13:08.538 --> 13:10.790
before devouring them.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.375
‐ Let's get more...
‐ Aaah!

13:12.375 --> 13:13.459
..hands on!

13:13.835 --> 13:17.380
Er, excuse me.
Gotta go to the restroom.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.923
It's kinda urgent.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.926
(Door slams)

13:25.179 --> 13:28.558
Me too. Must be a stomach bug.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.642
(Chuckles)

13:34.731 --> 13:37.608
(Murmurs of anxiety)

13:37.608 --> 13:39.277
Creepy...

13:39.277 --> 13:40.862
‐ What's up, dude?
‐ Aaah!

13:40.862 --> 13:44.490
Nothing.
I just needed... some air.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.618
I can think of better places
than bathrooms for air quality.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.245
(Nervous laugh)

13:50.121 --> 13:52.457
So, if you're all good,
can we go back to class?

13:53.624 --> 13:55.626
Uh... I mean, sure!

13:55.626 --> 13:57.962
(Laughter)

14:02.467 --> 14:05.470
Those textbooks
will help you and your partner

14:05.470 --> 14:09.307
identify the species
of the spider in your vivariums.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.768
‐ I'll go find ours.
‐ Wait. I'll go!

14:11.768 --> 14:14.645
‐ No, no, I'll go!
‐ I insist!

14:14.645 --> 14:16.647
Just let me go already!

14:17.273 --> 14:18.816
Aaah!

14:23.613 --> 14:24.864
‐ Huh?
‐ (Gasps)

14:33.581 --> 14:35.458
‐ Ha!
‐ (Screaming)

14:36.375 --> 14:38.628
‐ A ghost!
‐ I'm so scared!

15:01.442 --> 15:03.319
Let's go, it's not safe in here!

15:04.320 --> 15:06.072
Mike! Mike!

15:10.243 --> 15:11.327
Aaah!

15:16.457 --> 15:17.834
Andy!

15:22.588 --> 15:24.257
Aaah!

15:27.593 --> 15:29.679
‐ Andy!
‐ It's cool, we'll save him.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.517
<i>Everyone OK?</i>
<i>I was baking a cheesecake</i>

15:34.517 --> 15:37.562
<i>when I detected</i>
<i>ghost activity at your school.</i>

15:37.562 --> 15:40.898
<i>It's beetroot flavoured.</i>
<i>The cheesecake, not the ghost.</i>

15:40.898 --> 15:43.651
<i>That would be weird.</i>
<i>The ghost is called Arak.</i>

15:43.651 --> 15:46.529
<i>‐ A level fiver resembling ‐‐</i>
‐ A spider! Yeah, we know.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.739
<i>Oh, so you saw it then?</i>

15:48.739 --> 15:52.618
Beware, this ghost collects its
prey according to their colours.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.663
It's already merged with
a wad of gum and captured Andy!

15:55.663 --> 15:57.999
(Gasps) <i>Captured?</i>

15:57.999 --> 16:00.918
It's dragging Andy towards
the Empire State Building!

16:00.918 --> 16:03.212
‐ Let's move!
‐ I'll send Glowboo,

16:03.212 --> 16:05.423
after I've recharged him.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.800
Baking eats up
a lot of his battery.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.927
‐ Let's go, Ghost Force!
‐ Wait.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.346
Shouldn't we come up
with a plan

16:12.346 --> 16:14.974
‐ before we jump in and fight?
‐ There's no time.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.186
‐ Andy needs us!
‐ Right, but it's just that...

16:18.186 --> 16:20.188
this ghost
has you way off your game.

16:20.188 --> 16:23.441
What?
It's just like any other ghost.

16:23.441 --> 16:26.819
And we're the Ghost Force.
I've always got, er... game.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.532
<i>Ghost Force!</i>
<i>Don't fear the glow!</i>

16:36.787 --> 16:38.247
Krush!

16:39.332 --> 16:40.625
Myst!

16:43.211 --> 16:44.212
Ghost Force!

16:59.810 --> 17:01.687
They should be right here.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.564
(Low growl)

17:03.564 --> 17:04.607
Aaah!

17:07.818 --> 17:08.903
Ha, ha!

17:13.616 --> 17:15.660
See? You are off your game.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.828
Does this have
anything to do with spiders?

17:18.204 --> 17:22.959
What? No! More like we can't go
into battle without Fury, right?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.213
Ooh!

17:30.591 --> 17:33.344
Ew, this is almost
as gross as Andy's room.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.513
Arak's clearly
got a thing for yellow.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.598
And I'd steer clear of the webs.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.233
Honestly! This is
even worse than that time

17:47.233 --> 17:50.528
‐ I got gum stuck in my hair!
‐ I know, right?

17:50.528 --> 17:54.073
How tragic. Stay put.
We'll be back to help ASAP!

17:58.995 --> 18:01.038
It's not like
we're going anywhere!

18:01.038 --> 18:03.583
At least we have a nice view,
and snacks!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.167
I'm living the dream.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.592
Andy!

18:14.760 --> 18:17.555
Took you long enough!
I was starting to get a cramp.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.558
Dude, I'm so sorry!
This is all my fault!

18:20.558 --> 18:22.059
‐ I should've ‐‐
‐ Don't sweat it.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.395
Let me out
and tell me what's bugging ya.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.233
Huh?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.153
Ready for action!

18:33.613 --> 18:34.488
Aaah!

18:36.532 --> 18:37.325
Awesome!

18:40.703 --> 18:41.871
Boo! (Evil laugh)

18:41.871 --> 18:43.122
(Crash)

18:47.335 --> 18:50.796
Nice. Way to keep things
on the DL, Glowboo.

18:50.796 --> 18:55.092
Thank you, but Glowboo does
not compute. Please define DL.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.598
Oh, no!

19:04.685 --> 19:07.271
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

19:07.271 --> 19:09.482
It's OK, Krush.
You free Andy and Glowboo

19:09.482 --> 19:10.691
while I handle the ghost.

19:11.776 --> 19:12.943
Spectral Gate!

19:20.701 --> 19:21.661
Ha, ha!

19:29.835 --> 19:33.130
What's up? You've been
acting weird since this morning.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.133
Have not! You think it's easy
getting you unstuck?

19:36.133 --> 19:38.511
No, but I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.055
Chewing gum can't stop
a smartie‐genius like you!

19:41.055 --> 19:43.683
(Gasps) That's it! Chewing gum!

19:43.683 --> 19:45.559
Yeah, we've established that.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.478
Maybe you're not
so smart after all.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.605
Don't you get it?
All we gotta do

19:49.605 --> 19:52.316
is create an endothermic
reaction to freeze the gum!

19:57.446 --> 20:00.741
‐ Yeah!
‐ Guys! A little help here?

20:00.741 --> 20:03.119
All right! Time for a Boo fight!

20:07.957 --> 20:09.250
Aaah!

20:11.544 --> 20:12.503
Yeah!

20:14.588 --> 20:15.631
Whoa!

20:17.842 --> 20:19.552
So many legs!

20:24.598 --> 20:26.976
Krush, use your powers
to neutralise its attacks!

20:26.976 --> 20:28.978
It's our only chance!

20:28.978 --> 20:32.606
‐ Ha, ha!
‐ MYST: Krush!

20:32.606 --> 20:33.607
I can't!

20:36.444 --> 20:37.820
Krush!

20:42.575 --> 20:43.617
(Thud)

20:49.081 --> 20:51.083
Aw, man, not again!

20:51.083 --> 20:53.794
Aaah! (Thud)

20:53.794 --> 20:57.089
Krush, we really need you
to get over your arachnophobia!

20:57.089 --> 20:59.800
Wait. What? So that's why
he's been acting so weird?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.469
(Evil laugh)

21:04.847 --> 21:06.056
(Evil laugh)

21:18.986 --> 21:22.031
(Anxious squeals)

21:22.031 --> 21:26.076
<i>‐ Krush! Pull yourself together</i>
<i>‐ I can't, Miss Jones.</i>

21:26.076 --> 21:28.954
I'm sorry.
I'm not cut out for this.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.874
‐ I'm scared.
<i>‐ I know the feeling.</i>

21:31.874 --> 21:34.960
<i>I'm always scared when you guys</i>
<i>go out in the field.</i>

21:34.960 --> 21:39.340
Listen, Mike, being a superhero
doesn't make you fearless.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.383
<i>You just gotta</i>
<i>forget your fears.</i>

21:50.017 --> 21:51.644
‐ Ho, ho! Yeah! Nice!
‐ Yeah!

21:58.067 --> 21:59.735
No!

22:12.748 --> 22:14.208
(Gasps)

22:19.630 --> 22:20.881
You can do this!

22:32.810 --> 22:34.311
Growmax!

22:39.942 --> 22:41.360
(Growls)

22:54.582 --> 22:56.000
No!

23:07.803 --> 23:09.305
Yeah!

23:11.599 --> 23:13.893
(Cheering)

23:13.893 --> 23:15.561
Thank you, bro!

23:16.896 --> 23:20.608
ALL: Boo‐ya!

23:22.359 --> 23:26.864
Miss Jones? I think Glowboo's
gonna need another update.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.334
Are you sure
you want to do this?

23:38.334 --> 23:42.922
Sure. I mean,
now I overcame my fear, so...

23:42.922 --> 23:44.548
Aaah!

23:44.548 --> 23:48.177
She moved her legs!
Professor, excuse me!

23:48.177 --> 23:49.803
Can I use the restroom?
