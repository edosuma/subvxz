WEBVTT

00:06.960 --> 00:10.360
Oh, what the actual fuck? Alison!

00:11.800 --> 00:16.120
What is this here?
What is this here, please?

00:16.160 --> 00:18.120
Oh, I... I thought it was nice.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.560
- Right. So it's not a dig?
- How is that a dig?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.240
A dig at me, at my choices.

00:22.280 --> 00:25.080
Is it?

00:25.120 --> 00:27.960
Is that what it is, Alison?
"Life is for living."

00:28.000 --> 00:30.400
- Funny that, isn't it?
- A bit of a coincidence.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.000
- Are they new cushions?
- Is that a throw?

00:35.040 --> 00:37.840
What? I'm just trying
to make it nice.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.320
Oh, my God! I see what this is.
This is a trap.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.640
You're just trying to lure me
into the living room

00:43.680 --> 00:45.480
so I get all comfy and...

00:45.520 --> 00:47.880
Nicky! Alison is trying to trap us.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.680
She's, quote,
"made the living room all nice."

00:50.720 --> 00:54.280
- What?
- I had some Habitat vouchers, I...

00:54.320 --> 00:55.840
What did you think would happen?

00:55.880 --> 01:00.440
That we would just sit down watching
Gogglebox together, eating Maltesers?

01:00.480 --> 01:02.960
I don't even like Maltesers.
Doesn't even like Maltesers.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.520
Look, I just get tired
of seeing backs -

01:06.560 --> 01:09.480
stood in doorways, looking at backs.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.000
All I see is backs. Backs.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.600
Yeah, cos our fronts are engaged
in something worthwhile.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.120
Grinding for items.
No, not just grinding for items.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.600
Playing, connecting, myth-making.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.400
Also grinding for items.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.080
All right. Forget it then.
Don't sit out here.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.920
Oh, don't worry. We won't.
Where are we going?

01:28.960 --> 01:30.840
Back to our rooms.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.880 --> 01:45.360
Do you know, we've spent 34 hours
on blimp travel?

01:45.400 --> 01:48.600
What are you talking about?
- I'm just looking at our build stats.

01:48.640 --> 01:52.200
That's not us doing missions. That's just
us commuting from one place to another.

01:52.240 --> 01:56.320
Isn't that insane?
- No. It's not insane.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.920
Actually, it's a very fucking large
kingdom.

01:59.960 --> 02:03.520
I'm going to look up how long
it took Paul McCartney Yeah, OK.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.080
Maybe don't do that, Nicky.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.759
40 minutes. Paul McCartney wrote
Hey Jude in 40 minutes

02:08.800 --> 02:11.720
and we've spent 34 hours
on blimp travel.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.560
Had a lot of fun on those blimp
rides, though - a lot of memories.

02:14.600 --> 02:18.240
Daddy, will you come and bake
Later, baby-cakes.

02:18.280 --> 02:22.320
51 times.
You could write Hey Jude 51 times

02:22.360 --> 02:24.240
in the time we've spent in blimps.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.960
What's everyone else doing
that's so worthwhile?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.440
What, they're all just sat around
writing brilliant novels and fucking?

02:30.480 --> 02:33.840
No, they're reading magazines and
finding new ways to hate themselves.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.240
It's eyebrows now.
It used to be no-one wanted eyebrows.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.480
All of a sudden,
everyone wants massive eyebrows.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.280
At least we're doing something.
We're connected.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.120
Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg.
Don't try to make this meaningful.

02:46.160 --> 02:50.040
It's fine.
It's over for us and that's fine.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.760
OK, he's coming on. What do you want
Yeah - chairs.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.240
Hello? Hello? Is there anyone there?

03:00.280 --> 03:02.040
Aloha!

03:02.080 --> 03:05.760
Hello!
Makes you feel a bit bad.

03:05.800 --> 03:09.360
Look at him.
OK, Meg - remember the raid?

03:09.400 --> 03:12.800
His primary weapon was a baguette.
It was actually a brioche.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.840
God! I just wish
he wasn't so fucking stupid.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.360
Whee!

03:18.400 --> 03:22.160
Meg, if you banged him, you'd
basically be exploiting a cretin.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.120
You could get done for exploiting
I know that, Nicky.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.360
And yet,
as my nubbin stirs in my pants,

03:27.400 --> 03:31.600
I cannot, hand on heart,
entirely rule it out.

03:32.720 --> 03:33.760
Whee!

03:33.800 --> 03:35.480
Oh, no! I've done it again.

03:44.080 --> 03:49.240
Meg, in the game, right,
would you be interested, right,

03:49.280 --> 03:51.200
in the game,

03:51.240 --> 03:52.600
in... in marrying me?

03:52.640 --> 03:54.880
Right? But in the game.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.880
Sorry. What the fuck are these words
that are coming out of your mouth?

03:57.920 --> 04:00.960
Cos all I'm hearing is, like,
dolphin sounds.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.520
Like...

04:02.560 --> 04:08.360
No, because I looked into it and you get 15% more
experience points if you're married to someone.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.520
I don't give a shit about XP points.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.280
From a character point of view,
why would Greta get married?

04:14.320 --> 04:16.920
She's notoriously promiscuous.
Well, she's a slag.

04:16.959 --> 04:19.959
Not a slag, Nicky.
She's just open to experiences.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.959
She's pan, she's bi.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.560
One day it's orcs,
the next day it's vampire priests.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.880
She's a sexual conundrum.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.960
If she got some easy XP,
she could level up.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.320
You know, give her that final push
into the citadel,

04:32.360 --> 04:34.520
maybe even defeat the Hive Mother.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.600
Well, yes, obviously it would be nice
to defeat the Hive Mother.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.840
She brought ruin to that kingdom.

04:39.880 --> 04:44.360
She drove the Cat Folk of Calduggan
into the sea, Nicky. In the sea.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.200
They can't swim. They're cats.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.440
And you said yourself, Meg,
what else is there?

04:48.480 --> 04:50.520
Sitting in Alison's death pit
on a comfy cushion?

04:50.560 --> 04:53.760
If we're going to do this,
we might as well commit.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.840
All right, fine, whatever.
Consider yourself engaged.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.400
Oh, my God.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.080
I know.

05:04.120 --> 05:07.040
You're engaged?
In the game.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.400
It's a game!
We're engaged in a game.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.840
You're getting married in Kingdom Scrolls?
It's just for the XP points.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.320
It's basically a visa wedding.
It's like - I don't know.

05:15.360 --> 05:19.000
Some young hot Syrian refugee
being forced into marrying

05:19.040 --> 05:21.320
this old, fat horrible van driver
from Barnsley

05:21.360 --> 05:23.400
that she finds disgusting.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.600
It's not that
but it is something similar.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.760
And what about the man
from your work, Meg?

05:27.800 --> 05:30.400
The man you both murdered?
We're hiding from him.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.040
Yeah, every time he comes online
we turn into chairs.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.520
OK, I'm just going to have to hit
pause for a second.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.360
God, I fucking hate you
when you hit pause.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.200
The next time
you get a weepie on rum

05:39.240 --> 05:42.520
and you say to me, "Alison,
why do you always have a boyfriend?"

05:42.560 --> 05:46.040
I'm going to say, "Because I don't turn into
a chair every time they come into a room."

05:46.080 --> 05:48.480
Forget Russell!

05:48.520 --> 05:51.680
Let's all just forget about Russell.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.120
And you don't think it's going to make
things weird between the two of you?

05:57.160 --> 06:00.080
OK, Alison.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.560
Would it make things weird
if I bought a frying pan?

06:03.600 --> 06:04.880
Oh, yeah! Alison,

06:04.920 --> 06:07.160
would it make things weird
if Meg bought a frying pan?

06:07.200 --> 06:11.720
This isn't the same as buying This is
exactly the Just like buying a fryingpan.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.160
OK, to be honest,
it's quite an odd comparison,

06:14.200 --> 06:16.320
so, in a way,
it's already gone a bit weird.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.760
Alison, sh!

06:17.800 --> 06:19.560
Let me just put this to bed for you,
OK?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.680
Two nerds in a house, Meg and me.

06:21.720 --> 06:25.240
Now, the classic series arc
for a pair of characters like us

06:25.280 --> 06:28.000
is that we get together -
well, that ain't my arc, baby.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.080
No, me, neither. In fact,
I'm breaking out of my little box,

06:31.120 --> 06:34.160
my little box set, and I'm
fucking off to some other show.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.440
Yeah, me too.
I'm out the door.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.240
Oh, no! Now you're in the show
on your own, Alison.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.600
I hope
you don't die alone in your own show

06:42.640 --> 06:44.720
on your own, Alison.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.240
Let's go, fiance.

06:58.760 --> 07:04.080
Wow, look at this place. It must be
a furniture warehouse of some kind.

07:04.120 --> 07:07.160
God, there's some
really nice pieces.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.840
So where are they then,
these new friends of yours?

07:09.880 --> 07:13.800
Oh, no, it keeps doing this.
I find them on the map

07:13.840 --> 07:15.840
and when I get there,
it's just chairs.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.000
I wonder why there's
so much furniture in this game?

07:18.040 --> 07:20.640
Marriage, dude? That's heavy.

07:20.680 --> 07:24.120
It would be if I had any feelings
for Meg but I don't, so it isn't.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.280
I just feel dead from the waist down
whenever I think about her.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.840
In fact, if I trigger
the paralysis emote,

07:29.880 --> 07:32.000
this is me thinking about Meg.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.960
Cos me and my wife,
we're so hot for each other.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.880
Date night once a month.
Make a big effort.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.800
This month I got us two tickets
for a band we're both really into.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.560
Holy fuck, it's this Thursday.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.200
How is that this Thursday?

07:46.240 --> 07:49.920
Dinner and a band straight after.
I have a quest line to finish

07:49.960 --> 07:52.680
and instead I'm going to be in a
room, in a sweater, watching a band.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.560
Fuck my life!

07:54.600 --> 07:58.080
Hey, sweetie. Dinner smells amazing.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.720
Here comes the bride, motherfuckers!

08:02.760 --> 08:05.520
Sorry I'm late.
I had a bachelorette party

08:05.560 --> 08:07.120
with the boys from the US server.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.800
Got drunk and killed a villager.

08:08.840 --> 08:12.920
Oh, Satan's Donut said
he's sorry he can't make it.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.080
He's got a shift at the carpet shop.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.440
He sent a calf. Oh, that's nice.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.880
Right, then.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.400
Guess we should just do it, then.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.280
We're gathered here today
to celebrate the union

08:25.320 --> 08:28.120
of Greta Longstocking
and Mark The Unwavering.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.600
You know this is actually kind of adorable?
How is this adorable, Alison?

08:31.640 --> 08:33.480
I'm being trafficked.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.080
The system is coercing me
into marrying someone

08:37.120 --> 08:39.520
that makes me physically...

08:39.559 --> 08:42.840
Ergh.
Huerrr.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.200
Who's this trying to join the chat?

08:47.240 --> 08:50.480
Hello? Can anyone hear me? Meg?

08:50.520 --> 08:53.200
Surprise!

08:53.240 --> 08:57.280
You invited my fucking mum?
I thought it would be nice.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.240
Hello? Meg?

08:59.280 --> 09:02.280
Anyway, why would it be weird?
It's just like buying a frying pan.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.080
I'm not sure my thing's connected.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.680
Mum, I'm going to have to hex you
down to the Dark Circle

09:07.720 --> 09:09.840
because I just can't even deal.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.760
Oh! What's happening?

09:11.800 --> 09:12.960
Meg!

09:13.000 --> 09:15.360
Did you just hex your mum?

09:15.400 --> 09:18.880
Dude, you just banished her
to the Dark Circle. That's cold.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.480
Let's just get this over with.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.400
You may now kiss the bride.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.560
Oh, OK. I'll do that, then, shall I?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.960
Yeah, right,
because we're so in love.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.440
Kissy-kissy.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.000
I concur.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.280
God, this is so great.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.840
15%.
It's such an under-appreciated buff.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.160
Seriously,
everyone should get married.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.880
All those losers out there,
questing solo, like this guy.

10:00.920 --> 10:04.480
Oi! Get a life, you wanker.
Yeah, you wifeless wanker!

10:07.320 --> 10:08.880
So, I had an idea.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.000
If we wash our faces
and brush our teeth about 7pm,

10:12.040 --> 10:13.480
then it's out of the way,

10:13.520 --> 10:16.800
then we can stay up till 1, 2am
just looting, looting, looting.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.320
Nicky, I am not brushing my teeth
at 7pm.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.760
Good.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.720
My health is lower
than a camel's ball sack.

10:25.760 --> 10:32.000
No, like, actual rations. I got you
actual rations from the shop.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.600
It's a lasagne.

10:33.640 --> 10:37.000
Yeah.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.080
From the shops?
With some garlic bread.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.960
It came in a deal.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.160
Right.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.720
I was buying one for myself
anyway.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.480
I thought I'd get a bigger one
that feeds us both

10:52.520 --> 10:54.360
and we wouldn't have to stop
playing.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.160
Did you...?

10:59.320 --> 11:00.920
Did you get me a pudding?

11:01.960 --> 11:05.800
God, no! No puddings.
Absolutely zero puddings.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.800
Oh! I thought you'd gone all weird
for a second.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.360
I mean, what kind of pervert
goes around buying puddings?

11:21.480 --> 11:24.360
Hey, Meg. Quick question about
Kingdom Scrolls.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.760
Are you hiding from me?
In the game.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.320
Do you and your friends hide from me
by turning into chairs?

11:30.360 --> 11:33.760
I looked it up online and there's a magic
pebble that lets you turn into furniture.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.520
Right. Yes, we are doing that.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.400
OK. Can I just ask why?

11:39.440 --> 11:42.440
Is it because...?

11:42.480 --> 11:44.760
Is it because I'm annoying?

11:44.800 --> 11:47.280
Yeah. It is because of that, yeah.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.360
Oh, OK! No, great.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.280
That's what Mum said.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.480
I'm still going to play it, though.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.840
Because it's... It's fun

11:58.880 --> 12:00.640
and last night I went down
to the harbour

12:00.680 --> 12:03.400
and threw a deer into the water
and I shot fireworks at it

12:03.440 --> 12:05.920
and it was...

12:05.960 --> 12:09.240
It was... Phhhwwrrr!
Yeah, we used to do that.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.200
Me and Nicky.
We once spent an entire evening

12:12.240 --> 12:16.160
trying to ride a stallion
up to the top, into the volcano.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.640
Molten lava kept burning its hooves.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.800
It was just like, "No! No!!

12:21.840 --> 12:24.400
"Whaaa! My hooves are on fire!

12:24.440 --> 12:26.920
"Whaa! Whaaa! Brr!"

12:28.840 --> 12:32.200
We just kept riding him on up there.

12:32.240 --> 12:36.880
Now we just grind because
we are grinding towards the endgame.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.200
Anyway, I'm going to go fire
Roman candles at some elks.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.920
'Right, the rats have been slain.
Let's away, fair maiden.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.600
'Wife.'

12:51.640 --> 12:54.680
Actually, Russell...
'Shall we? Hello?'

13:00.480 --> 13:03.320
You're brushing your teeth?
The One Show hasn't finished

13:03.360 --> 13:05.800
and you're brushing your teeth?
Yep.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.640
No longer the tyranny
of late-night ablutions for me.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.320
Log on, find the items,
acquire the items,

13:11.360 --> 13:14.600
equip the items, upgrade the items,
outgrow the items,

13:14.640 --> 13:15.640
trade the items.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.120
Bed, work, home and play.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.760
And repeat.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.160
Tremendous.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.400
Where's Meg?

13:29.560 --> 13:31.520
Alison!

13:35.640 --> 13:40.320
'This is Meg. I probably don't feel
like talking right now.'

13:40.360 --> 13:44.760
Hey, Meg. It's Nicky,
your significant other.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.040
Not to be a nag
but when are you likely to be home?

13:48.080 --> 13:50.520
Also, your lasagne's
quite fucking cold. OK, bye.

14:04.800 --> 14:08.040
A-ha! The elusive wife returns.

14:08.080 --> 14:12.240
Nicky, are you feeling OK?
Yeah. I'm great, thanks.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.840
Just letting off some steam.

14:17.280 --> 14:21.520
I was just feeling
a bit het up for some reason,

14:21.560 --> 14:24.040
so I thought I'd tidy up the field,
have a bit of a clear-out.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.320
Mm.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.040
Where have you been? Oh, I just went to
the pub with some of the guys from work.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.080
That's very interesting -
"some of the guys". Nice and vague.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.920
Oh, sweet baby Mario. Not Calf.

14:38.960 --> 14:43.120
Oh!

14:43.160 --> 14:45.240
Ahem. Whoo!

14:45.280 --> 14:46.800
Whoops.

14:46.840 --> 14:52.640
Anyway, hubby, I might just turn in.
Okey-dokey.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.280
I'm going to finish up here.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.040
Only a couple more and I'll unlock
the Cow Slayer achievement.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.840
Here comes a dopamine rush.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.360
Then it's gone.

15:14.400 --> 15:19.800
Meg, I made you some Cup-a-Soup
to say sorry for slaying the calf.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.760
Erm, it's two o'clock
in the morning, Nicky.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.880
I don't really want any soup. Thanks.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.040
OK. I'll just flush it down the
fucking toilet then, shall I? Night.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.200
Meg? Me again.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.880
Did you smear my Oral-B Pro Expert
all over the mirror?

15:45.520 --> 15:47.520
Yeah. Yeah, I did do that.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.920
But I was just a bit angry
because you killed the baby cow.

15:50.960 --> 15:55.160
But that was before
you made me the soup to say sorry.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.240
Crikey. Talk about crossed wires.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.720
Oh, God! I know.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.960
We should see a bloody marriage
guidance counsellor or something.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.080
Ha!

16:12.240 --> 16:14.080
Ha.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.720
So should I make you some more soup
Got it.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.560
Night.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.000
So great that everything's cool
between the two of you.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.960
I'd hate to feel like the third
It's all totally cool.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.200
Ooh! I might throw some gold at
this dancing gentleman from Mexico.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.600
That's from the joint account,
Great.

16:37.640 --> 16:40.480
I might go to the tavern.
Find a wench and then fuck it.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.320
Fine by me. Don't get groin rot.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.360
Cute.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.560
Date night tonight, which is going
to be pretty fucking great

16:47.600 --> 16:49.120
because I ain't going.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.200
Yep. Pulled a sickie.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.840
I'd better just stay in and play
Kingdom Scrolls in my onesie.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.160
Good. It's important you still have
Completely agree.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.560
More gold! Dance, senor, dance.

17:00.600 --> 17:05.760
It's actually worked out perfectly because there's
this guy she's always talking about - Wade.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.560
So I palmed her off onto him.
Oh, right.

17:07.599 --> 17:11.520
Sucker! I was all like,
"So sorry I can't make it.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.920
"Have a great night with Wade. Take
50 bucks and get your hair done."

17:14.960 --> 17:17.839
And she looked great. And she was
like, "Don't wait up, baby."

17:17.880 --> 17:20.400
And I was like, "OK, I won't."

17:20.440 --> 17:24.200
Then boom!
The Cat Man is back in town.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.280
And you're not, like, jealous?

17:26.319 --> 17:30.520
Why would I be jealous?
They have to go and see a band.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.120
They have to stand up on their feet
in a room for two hours

17:34.160 --> 17:35.240
and for what?

17:35.280 --> 17:37.240
To hear some songs.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.840
So worth it!
"Please play some more songs!"

17:40.880 --> 17:43.760
OK, Russell's coming.
We need to hide.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.440
Actually, Nicky,
we don't need to hide any more.

17:46.480 --> 17:50.120
There's something we should tell you.
We just got married!

17:50.160 --> 17:53.400
What's he talking about?
They relaxed the laws on bigamy.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.760
It's like the Hive Mother's one piece
of progressive legislation.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.600
So you just went out
and married someone else, did you?

17:59.640 --> 18:02.080
Nicky! You knew the deal
when you shacked up with Greta.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.080
You can't cage the beast.
She's a libidinous animal.

18:05.120 --> 18:08.000
Yeah, I know, but...

18:08.040 --> 18:12.200
Him? He's a newb. I bet he's playing
with his mouth open.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.560
I mean, it is slightly ajar.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.120
No. It's cool.

18:18.160 --> 18:23.000
Meg marries Russell and they both
live happily ever after.

18:23.040 --> 18:26.560
Ooh. I wonder what's at the bottom
of this ravine.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.760
Ah. Nothing.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.800
Meg! What are you doing, Meg?

19:00.840 --> 19:05.840
Erm... Oh, I'm just putting bits
into Nicky's no-bits orange juice.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.320
That's it. Nicky!

19:08.360 --> 19:11.200
Nicky, take the tampons out of
your ears. I know you can hear me.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.440
Oh, hey, Alison. What's up?
You two - sit.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.040
This whole marriage thing - you are
messing with forces beyond your control.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.800
You're emotional cripples
and you're out of your depth.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.280
You're like apes in a science lab
trying to make a chemical compound.

19:25.320 --> 19:27.120
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ah-ah-ah! This in here.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.480
Ay-ooh-ah-ooh-ha. This in here.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.760
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ah-ah-ah!
I dropped a test tube.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.600
Trainers in the fridge,
tampons in ears.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.840
Somebody filled the toilet cistern
with milk and cornflakes.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.760
It is insane
and I don't know what it is

19:38.800 --> 19:41.520
but I just think that maybe
you're in love with each other.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.640
Tch!

19:43.680 --> 19:45.840
OK, Alison.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.240
You've gone psychotic.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.800
Three options, Alison.
One, you shut up forever.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.720
Two, you need to be sectioned,
or three, we just kill you.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.040
Yeah - which is it going to be,
I mean it. This ends now.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.480
Either get a divorce or go and fuck

19:59.520 --> 20:00.800
or move out of my flat.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.040
Fine. Yeah. Let's just go and do it.
What?

20:07.080 --> 20:10.120
Yeah! Yeah! Let's fuck,
if that's what she wants.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.880
Erm...

20:20.880 --> 20:22.200
Right, then.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.480
Mm-hm.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.840
Happy now, Alison?

20:29.880 --> 20:32.400
We're doing it!
We're fucking each other.

20:32.440 --> 20:36.560
Is this what you wanted, Alison?
And there's nothing - no feelings.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.480
No feelings whatsoever, Alison.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.120
Oh, what, do you want
the reverse cowgirl? Yeah?

20:41.160 --> 20:43.680
I'll take her from behind
then, shall I, Alison?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.480
Is she still there, Meg?

20:54.520 --> 20:56.560
Yeah. Yeah, just keep going.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.920
Er!

21:14.960 --> 21:18.080
I'm so utterly turned on,
I've just blown my beans inside you.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.280
Er, yeah. I too have just orgasmed,

21:21.320 --> 21:25.160
sending hot waves of ecstasy
rippling through my body.

21:27.280 --> 21:31.040
Totally, totally, totally.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.920
Well, I think we've proved
our point.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.280
We've successfully subverted
our series arc.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.960
Fuck that shit.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.320
Oh, btw - you did release your mum
from the Dark Circle, didn't you?

21:44.360 --> 21:45.960
Oh, fuck!

21:48.000 --> 21:53.440
Help me! Help me!
