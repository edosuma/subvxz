00:23.540 --> 00:24.541
Neal?

00:24.575 --> 00:26.440
You must be Molly.

00:26.675 --> 00:27.739
Relax. Take your coat off.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.406
Okay. Sorry.

00:29.439 --> 00:30.844
I'm a little nervous.

00:31.090 --> 00:34.196
I've never gone out with someone
I met online before, so...

00:34.293 --> 00:35.076
You're kidding.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.177
No.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.641
Well, I am on all of them...

00:37.988 --> 00:40.310
Tinder, Hinge, Holefinder, you name it.

00:40.713 --> 00:44.188
Although after tonight,
I may be closing my accounts.

00:48.322 --> 00:50.524
O-kay...

00:56.137 --> 00:57.639
Uh...

00:58.739 --> 01:00.582
You want to go screw in the toilet?

01:01.402 --> 01:04.038
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:06.874 --> 01:08.442
God, you're amazing.

01:08.475 --> 01:09.717
Tell me you love me.

01:10.671 --> 01:11.568
What?

01:12.579 --> 01:14.047
Tell me... you love me.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.562
- Uh..
- Mm! Mm!

01:15.562 --> 01:16.530
I...I don't know.

01:16.563 --> 01:17.564
Yeah.

01:17.596 --> 01:19.333
Tell me you love me.

01:19.366 --> 01:20.746
Uh... Oh!

01:21.735 --> 01:24.307
Oh, you are a nasty little smurf.

01:24.604 --> 01:25.706
I love you.

01:25.738 --> 01:27.607
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.

01:37.917 --> 01:40.887
Good night, guys. See you tomorrow.

01:47.289 --> 01:49.559
All clear in here? Closing up.

01:51.436 --> 01:53.741
Hey, buddy, you okay?

01:54.500 --> 01:55.584
Bar's closed.

02:23.541 --> 02:27.400

02:31.271 --> 02:32.439
We can expect temps today

02:32.471 --> 02:34.373
in the low 50s to upper 60s.

02:34.407 --> 02:35.875
- What's wrong, Jean?
- Oh, Jesus.

02:35.909 --> 02:36.977
I'm supposed to visit my Nana,

02:37.010 --> 02:39.646
but I'm up to here with old-lady stink.

02:39.678 --> 02:41.515
You need Decay Away!

02:41.547 --> 02:44.217
Decay Away? Tell me more!

02:49.689 --> 02:50.791
Hungover?

02:51.582 --> 02:52.340
No.

02:56.663 --> 02:59.232
I just... picked up
Grace at her father's

02:59.266 --> 03:00.867
and his girlfriend was there.

03:01.274 --> 03:02.301
I'm sorry, did I say girlfriend?

03:02.334 --> 03:05.338
I meant "FiancÃ©e."
And how do I know that?

03:05.738 --> 03:08.708
'Cause she has the ring.

03:09.214 --> 03:11.295
His bitchy grandmother's

03:11.370 --> 03:13.580
diamond engagement ring... giant.

03:13.612 --> 03:15.414
And she wouldn't give it to me,

03:15.447 --> 03:18.318
because my hands are "Too masculine."

03:18.350 --> 03:20.553
Your timing couldn't be more perfect.

03:20.610 --> 03:22.879
They're doing speed dating
tomorrow night at Champs.

03:22.888 --> 03:25.592
Ugh. Champs is for losers.

03:25.624 --> 03:26.926
Also, what if they won't let me in,

03:26.959 --> 03:29.018
you know, with my "Monster hands"?

03:29.495 --> 03:32.298
Come on, you're new to the
area, you work all the time.

03:32.332 --> 03:33.967
How are you gonna meet someone new?

03:33.999 --> 03:35.368
Hey, I'm gonna be there.

03:35.402 --> 03:37.504
I'll help screen out all the creeps.

03:38.235 --> 03:40.282
No. You're not the best judge of crazy.

03:43.118 --> 03:47.490
No, I would... I would need
someone really judgmental.

03:56.140 --> 03:57.671
Wow. That's... It's funny...

03:58.192 --> 04:01.908
I-I don't see any boxing ring,
and I don't see no bear.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.411
In fact, I don't even see no Russian

04:03.444 --> 04:04.712
about to fight a bear.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.594
All I actually do see

04:06.846 --> 04:10.321
is an ocean of boring
with no land in sight.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.754
- Name tags!
- I'm sorry.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.689
I made up the bear stuff,
'cause I didn't think

04:15.722 --> 04:18.591
that you would willingly
come to speed dating.

04:18.624 --> 04:20.994
I'd willingly give a
bear a prostate exam

04:21.028 --> 04:25.866
before I'd willingly come to
speed dating, for Christ's sake.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.701
Please? Okay.
You know everybody in town.

04:28.734 --> 04:31.122
Just point out the weirdos.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.735
A bear fight...

04:33.639 --> 04:35.335
It's the stuff dreams are made of.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.545
You got to let that go.

04:42.648 --> 04:44.266
You're a shining star.

04:58.097 --> 05:01.068
So, did you always want to pull
weeds at the cemetery?

05:01.587 --> 05:03.409
T-totally. Yeah. Totally.

05:03.439 --> 05:06.760
Her name is Maisy,
and I have a cat tree for her,

05:06.987 --> 05:09.009
and it has a little planter that I made,

05:09.043 --> 05:12.342
and I just love just
to hold her at night.

05:12.980 --> 05:13.881
- Cheers!
- Hey!

05:13.913 --> 05:15.015
Okay, s-sure, sure, sure.

05:15.048 --> 05:15.750
- Cheers.
- Right here.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.518
- Oh, eye contact. Right.
- Yes.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.519
- Important.
- We already met.

05:19.552 --> 05:20.476
You remember?

05:21.602 --> 05:22.552
I don't think so.

05:22.553 --> 05:25.212
Yeah, you arrested me
for peeing in a mailbox.

05:27.424 --> 05:29.927
All these balloons kind of
look like boobs to me,

05:29.960 --> 05:30.929
don... don't they?

05:32.001 --> 05:32.636
What?

05:33.965 --> 05:35.566
But she's the boss.

05:35.599 --> 05:38.570
She keeps all the other cats in line.

05:38.571 --> 05:40.242
Y'ever see a cat fight a snake?

05:40.522 --> 05:41.081
What?

05:41.156 --> 05:43.607
That's what I'd like to see.
Or better yet...

05:43.640 --> 05:46.339
You ever see a cat fed
into an industrial chipper?

05:47.412 --> 05:50.015
It's a cat blizzard... cat.

05:50.047 --> 05:51.628
Oh!

05:53.271 --> 05:54.386
You like liquor?

05:54.575 --> 05:55.776
- It's fine.
- Good.

05:55.907 --> 05:57.856
I like liquor, too. Connection.

05:58.562 --> 05:59.759
Bottoms up.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.859
Oh, I have always wanted
a pot-bellied pig,

06:01.893 --> 06:03.428
but they're very expensive.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.679
I mean, I have "pig money,"

06:04.679 --> 06:07.468
but not, like, "Pig Money,"
if you know what I mean.

06:27.418 --> 06:28.519
Go ahead and make this snappy.

06:28.553 --> 06:29.435
I got to whiz.

06:29.853 --> 06:30.798
No, you don't.

06:32.770 --> 06:35.092
It's straight bourbon, if you want some.

06:35.547 --> 06:36.756
All righty, then.

06:43.334 --> 06:45.013
So, what are you, about 5'8"?

06:45.786 --> 06:47.954
6'2", eyes are blue, sister.

06:48.106 --> 06:49.240
Hmm.

06:51.009 --> 06:53.779
Hey. I'm Sloan.

06:54.275 --> 06:55.559
Uh, I'm Evie.

06:55.559 --> 06:56.194
Nice to meet you.

06:56.227 --> 06:57.895
Nice to meet you.

06:58.075 --> 06:59.541
This is totally weird, right?

06:59.540 --> 07:01.643
Oh, my God, yes.
Yeah, really kind of is.

07:01.675 --> 07:02.343
You know, you'd think they'd separate us

07:02.377 --> 07:03.944
into age-appropriate groups.

07:03.978 --> 07:05.680
But then I guess I wouldn't
have gotten to talk

07:05.720 --> 07:07.157
about catheters so much tonight.

07:07.157 --> 07:08.193
Thought I was the only one sitting...

07:08.225 --> 07:09.785
- Lucky you.
- I know.

07:09.786 --> 07:12.789
- Yeah.
- I... I know I just sat down,

07:12.830 --> 07:14.265
but you are, like,
the first person I've met

07:14.297 --> 07:15.999
that seems kind of normal.

07:16.033 --> 07:18.203
You want to... go somewhere?

07:20.071 --> 07:22.641
I know. It takes a lot
of work to be an alcoholic.

07:24.641 --> 07:25.610
I'm in.

07:25.643 --> 07:26.710
- All right.
- Sure, why not?

07:26.744 --> 07:28.613
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

07:37.909 --> 07:38.909
So... this is me.

07:38.942 --> 07:40.242
Oh.

07:40.243 --> 07:42.221
Yeah. You really didn't have to walk me

07:42.281 --> 07:43.409
all the way up to my house.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.444
You know, I'm... I'm
the sheriff, remember?

07:45.478 --> 07:47.013
Right.

07:47.045 --> 07:49.849
So, Sheriff, are you busy this week?

07:51.465 --> 07:53.986
Yeah, I'm just... But, you
know, just sheriffing,

07:54.019 --> 07:56.423
uh, and, you know, mothering.

07:57.496 --> 07:58.625
You should call me.

07:58.658 --> 08:01.027
We can... do something normal.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.762
- Great.
- Great.

08:07.466 --> 08:09.568
- Good night.
- Night.

08:09.601 --> 08:12.605
Okay... um... bye.

08:12.639 --> 08:14.375
- Yeah.
- Right.

08:53.552 --> 08:55.228
Oh! Oh, my God!

08:58.450 --> 09:00.283
It's a boy!

09:01.589 --> 09:04.627
Thank you.
Thank you for granting my wish.

09:04.660 --> 09:06.720
We are soul mates. I just know it.

09:15.704 --> 09:19.108
What? Yeah.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.176
Well, of course I remember you.

09:21.209 --> 09:23.146
I ain't senile, for God sake.

09:23.964 --> 09:24.675
Yeah.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.552
Well, sure.

09:27.416 --> 09:28.984
Yeah, I know that place.

09:29.017 --> 09:30.652
All right, then.

09:30.685 --> 09:32.912
Yeah, I'll meet you for lunch.

09:32.912 --> 09:35.537
All right. See you then.
I look forward to it. Bye.

09:42.559 --> 09:43.723
Denise!

09:48.370 --> 09:49.228
Denise.

09:51.797 --> 09:53.165
Did you eat my bacon?

09:53.731 --> 09:55.367
I took it, but I didn't eat it.

10:00.895 --> 10:02.477
You fed my bacon to a pig?

10:02.966 --> 10:05.443
Everybody loves bacon... Oh.

10:05.476 --> 10:06.911
It's unnatural.

10:06.945 --> 10:07.980
Where the hell did the pig come from?

10:08.013 --> 10:09.281
I don't know.

10:09.313 --> 10:11.816
Last night, I was talking
about wanting a pig,

10:11.850 --> 10:14.486
and then I woke up this
morning and there he was.

10:14.904 --> 10:17.307
I named him Murgatroyd.
I think we're soul mates.

10:17.340 --> 10:18.567
Remember this day,

10:19.743 --> 10:23.180
because soon I'm gonna tear my head off,

10:23.212 --> 10:24.313
throw it through the window,

10:24.346 --> 10:26.361
and escape out the broken glass.

10:28.298 --> 10:29.894
Remember this day.

10:31.421 --> 10:32.321
What are you doing?

10:32.355 --> 10:33.456
Get back in here!

10:36.326 --> 10:38.829
Well, it looks like someone
got lucky last night.

10:39.001 --> 10:40.370
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:40.371 --> 10:41.285
Well, look at me.

10:41.286 --> 10:44.130
I got a spring in my step, a rosy glow.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.722
I mean, I didn't technically
meet anybody, but I j...

10:46.755 --> 10:48.323
All right. If you must know,

10:48.356 --> 10:50.793
I did meet a charming
gentleman last night,

10:50.826 --> 10:53.416
and he walked me to my
door and that was that.

10:53.929 --> 10:55.364
You could have fooled me.

10:55.398 --> 10:57.533
You look like you were out all night.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.435
Now, I didn't meet anybody at the party,

10:59.467 --> 11:02.471
but after, this chick sent
me the filthiest text.

11:02.504 --> 11:03.605
Ah, let me read it.

11:04.144 --> 11:06.476
"What has four legs and a hump?"

11:06.509 --> 11:07.422
Oh, my God...

11:07.423 --> 11:09.159
"You and me on a date."

11:09.192 --> 11:11.995
What the hell is happening to me?

11:12.028 --> 11:15.999
I will have the number 3...
the fried-shrimp

11:16.031 --> 11:20.302
double-bacon-egg and cheese
burger, medium rare.

11:21.252 --> 11:23.539
And I will have the garden salad.

11:23.573 --> 11:24.707
And instead of what he ordered,

11:24.741 --> 11:26.009
he'll have the grilled salmon.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.443
Thanks.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.372
What would you say just happened there?

11:34.486 --> 11:37.386
Stanley, eating like that
is gonna kill you.

11:37.419 --> 11:39.588
I want you nice and healthy.

11:40.507 --> 11:43.471
It's hard to even imagine
that you've been divorced.

11:44.026 --> 11:46.061
Look, you're even losing your hair.

11:46.095 --> 11:48.431
Ah, I think it just committed suicide

11:48.463 --> 11:51.133
when it found out what I was
actually having for lunch.

11:51.166 --> 11:53.335
Stick with me, and you'll live forever.

11:53.369 --> 11:54.451
Hmm.

11:55.921 --> 11:57.197
It already feels like it.

12:43.419 --> 12:44.821
So nice, so nice.

12:50.827 --> 12:52.095
Here, let me help you, sweetie.

12:52.127 --> 12:53.729
- Oh!
- Oh.

12:55.398 --> 12:57.133
We did it.

12:57.165 --> 12:58.133
Sweet relief.

12:58.556 --> 12:59.359
Good work.

13:02.793 --> 13:05.761
Evie, there's something
I want to say to you.

13:07.142 --> 13:10.779
It's about how I feel, and...
I hope you feel it, too.

13:11.245 --> 13:11.917
Oh.

13:12.481 --> 13:15.385
Oh, Evie, say you love me.

13:16.770 --> 13:17.416
What?

13:26.201 --> 13:27.269
Goodbye.

13:39.446 --> 13:40.424
I'm home!

13:42.561 --> 13:43.299
Hmm.

13:49.101 --> 13:50.570
Oh! Aah!

13:50.602 --> 13:53.438
Aah! Aah!

13:53.471 --> 13:56.108
Aaaaah!!

14:02.280 --> 14:03.142
Hmm.

14:05.384 --> 14:06.208
No.

14:06.209 --> 14:07.145
You know, we should probably put in

14:07.179 --> 14:08.713
a pig door for Murgatroyd,

14:08.747 --> 14:10.015
so he can come and go as he pleases.

14:10.048 --> 14:10.881
Don't you think?

14:10.915 --> 14:12.818
He ain't gonna stay little forever.

14:12.851 --> 14:13.986
Before you know it,

14:14.019 --> 14:17.033
he's gonna be a big, fat,
regular pig like everybody else.

14:19.590 --> 14:22.593
Hey. There you go, buddy.

14:24.479 --> 14:25.142
Yeah.

14:26.197 --> 14:27.295
Probably shouldn't offer you an apple

14:27.296 --> 14:29.520
standing this close
to the oven, should I?

14:30.964 --> 14:32.589
Right. I see your point.

14:34.551 --> 14:35.851
Eh, we don't want any.

14:37.414 --> 14:39.199
What the hell happened to you?

14:39.488 --> 14:40.922
You used to be pretty,
and now you look like

14:40.955 --> 14:43.274
the business end of a baboon's asshole.

14:43.936 --> 14:46.594
Thanks. Can I... can I come in?

14:46.627 --> 14:49.031
Yeah. Want an apple?

14:49.663 --> 14:51.632
No! No. God, no.

14:51.665 --> 14:53.240
Can't seem to sell this thing.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.805
Oh, Christ.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.197
Well, look at the bright side...

15:03.617 --> 15:05.214
Now you can say
all the racist shit you want.

15:05.247 --> 15:07.748
Hell, I... I can't wait to be your age.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.891
All right. We got ourselves a succubus.

15:11.357 --> 15:12.870
Stan, how you feel since you, uh,

15:12.870 --> 15:13.771
since you met Brenda?

15:13.806 --> 15:15.806
Awful! She's always pecking away at me.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.743
She won't let me eat
what I want, and she...

15:18.777 --> 15:20.277
Hell, she gave me a watch.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.462
What? A watch is nice.

15:21.594 --> 15:23.107
Well, it's not a watch-watch.

15:23.108 --> 15:24.616
It counts your steps,

15:24.746 --> 15:26.472
and is that what we've
become as a country,

15:26.505 --> 15:27.807
a bunch of nancies afraid to eat bread,

15:27.808 --> 15:28.743
counting our steps?

15:28.777 --> 15:30.079
Tell you, the first thing
I want to count

15:30.111 --> 15:31.452
is how many steps it takes me

15:31.453 --> 15:33.647
- to run my head into a band saw.
- All right.

15:33.681 --> 15:36.951
So, it says that a succubus,
uh, drains its life force

15:36.984 --> 15:38.787
from its victim, and, uh,

15:39.183 --> 15:41.690
its ultimate goal is
to make that willing victim

15:41.723 --> 15:42.691
fall in love,

15:42.724 --> 15:45.728
and then it can shape-shift
into its true form.

15:45.761 --> 15:48.797
All right... Me, you... Where's Denise?

15:48.830 --> 15:50.318
She's playing with her pig.

15:51.974 --> 15:55.068
Literally. She... she has a pig.

15:55.905 --> 15:56.705
Okay.

15:56.738 --> 16:00.236
So, a succubus needs
a willing companion, right?

16:00.236 --> 16:02.210
So we just go to dump their asses.

16:02.244 --> 16:04.345
Oh, breaking up with a woman is easy.

16:04.378 --> 16:06.815
You just look 'em in
the eye and you say,

16:06.848 --> 16:09.685
"I know you're pregnant,
and I-I know it ain't mine."

16:09.718 --> 16:10.786
- Okay.
- And even if she ain't pregnant,

16:10.819 --> 16:13.889
she gets so angry that she...
she just goes nuts,

16:13.922 --> 16:15.891
and that's when you go,
"Look, I'm out of here."

16:15.930 --> 16:17.165
"You're nuts."

16:17.926 --> 16:19.261
All right. Okay!

16:19.881 --> 16:23.097
Here it is... a Sumerian
break-up incantation.

16:23.130 --> 16:24.365
This is great.

16:24.398 --> 16:27.101
Now, we have to do this one at a time...

16:27.796 --> 16:29.838
because you got to be
wearing this amulet.

16:29.870 --> 16:33.675
Uh... I am supposed
to meet Sloan for a date

16:33.709 --> 16:35.044
in 30 minutes.

16:35.076 --> 16:37.446
You sit tight. Don't do anything.

16:37.479 --> 16:40.114
I'm gonna break up with the succubus.

16:41.483 --> 16:42.917
Oh, Jesus!

16:43.650 --> 16:45.283
Don't... Don't offer to help.

16:46.721 --> 16:48.090
It never occurred to me.

16:53.762 --> 16:54.997
Thank you.

16:55.607 --> 16:57.144
Hey, hey. There's my girl.

16:59.211 --> 17:00.702
Uh. Sloan, uh...

17:01.516 --> 17:03.104
We need to talk.

17:03.138 --> 17:04.891
Okay, sure. Everything okay?

17:07.041 --> 17:08.342
Barra...

17:08.376 --> 17:10.012
Babe, what is this?

17:10.044 --> 17:12.781
Darisam...

17:12.813 --> 17:13.669
Okay.

17:14.750 --> 17:15.718
Don't you say it, you old hag!

17:15.751 --> 17:16.719
Not in this bar.

17:16.752 --> 17:18.787
Galal!

17:30.432 --> 17:32.014
Hey, nice work with that bat.

17:33.068 --> 17:37.138
Although, since the victim
has obviously disappeared,

17:37.171 --> 17:38.740
that leads me to believe

17:38.773 --> 17:40.391
that this was all just a dream!

17:40.392 --> 17:44.897
Ga-lala-lala... Everyone
just continue dreaming!

17:49.315 --> 17:51.786
We'll be back with more
"Deadliest Chefs."

17:52.604 --> 17:55.007
What's wrong, Jean?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.576
I'm supposed to visit my Nana,

17:56.609 --> 17:57.079
but I'm up to here with old-lady...

17:57.080 --> 17:59.221
Guys, it works! Huh?

17:59.538 --> 18:00.940
Stan, we got to find Brenda.

18:00.995 --> 18:02.172
Hey.

18:04.753 --> 18:07.585
Denise, have you been
dating anyone recently?

18:08.083 --> 18:09.786
Humph. No.

18:10.043 --> 18:12.571
Or just, like, hanging out
with somebody new?

18:12.984 --> 18:16.272
No, nobody but Murgatroyd.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.709
The pig.

18:18.884 --> 18:20.127
Well, that's it. That's it!

18:20.127 --> 18:22.089
Denise, you got to get rid of him.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.954
I can't. No, I-I'm going to my room.

18:26.737 --> 18:28.138
Murgatroyd.

18:28.139 --> 18:30.384
Why can't... I run? Why...

18:30.384 --> 18:32.983
- Oh, for Christ sake...
- Do you not... Denise!

18:34.048 --> 18:37.029
Denise! He's gonna kill you!

18:37.598 --> 18:38.785
He wouldn't do that!

18:38.786 --> 18:40.267
He's just a pig!

18:40.274 --> 18:41.074
That's it.

18:41.107 --> 18:43.065
Tomorrow, I am taking this door off.

18:43.066 --> 18:46.369
You have officially lost
your door privileges.

18:46.401 --> 18:48.871
I mean, why tomorrow. Why not today?

18:48.903 --> 18:49.805
That's curious.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.167
It's never quite enough
for you, is it, huh?

19:04.286 --> 19:06.889
Hey, guys. You remember Murgatroyd.

19:12.995 --> 19:14.030
Aah!

19:14.063 --> 19:15.832
Evie!

19:19.066 --> 19:20.367
Huh? Bacon for a pig.

19:20.402 --> 19:21.627
Suck on that.

19:23.094 --> 19:24.664
Huh?

19:26.901 --> 19:29.884
Okay. Okay, Denise,
we'll put this on you.

19:30.644 --> 19:33.200
Okay, now all you got to do is say...

19:33.233 --> 19:34.168
Shit!

19:34.169 --> 19:36.230
It was really veiny when I wrote this!

19:38.345 --> 19:39.055
Hammy!

19:41.011 --> 19:43.236
Uh... bar-nuf... bar... or deljib?

19:43.236 --> 19:44.504
No, no, no!

19:44.505 --> 19:46.570
Uh... ba-barra... barra, barra!

19:48.124 --> 19:49.592
Barra.

19:49.625 --> 19:52.561
Dar... Darisam! Darisam!

19:54.988 --> 19:55.730
Darisam.

19:57.261 --> 19:58.080
Gelal.

19:58.146 --> 19:59.415
Ahh, pig!

19:59.416 --> 20:00.527
Gelal.

20:07.741 --> 20:08.523
Gah!

20:12.197 --> 20:13.644
Well...

20:13.644 --> 20:16.280
You guys might have been
right about Murgatroyd.

20:16.315 --> 20:19.218
"Might" as in, like, "Maybe."

20:19.250 --> 20:20.485
Why do I smell bacon?

20:21.105 --> 20:22.114
Right on time.

20:22.838 --> 20:24.356
She doesn't even bother
to knock anymore.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.660
She just... lets herself in
like she owns the joint.

20:28.403 --> 20:29.130
Whew.

20:34.746 --> 20:36.902
What reeks in here, pork?

20:36.902 --> 20:38.745
Stanley, I'm trying to keep you healthy.

20:38.745 --> 20:40.537
Yeah, that's, uh, about enough of that.

20:40.538 --> 20:41.714
Evie, let me... give me the...

20:41.748 --> 20:43.182
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

20:43.216 --> 20:44.685
Uh, how's the... How's the thing go?

20:44.718 --> 20:46.385
- Right here.
- Oh.

20:47.221 --> 20:50.190
Uh... Barra Darisam...

20:50.222 --> 20:52.325
Gelal!

20:52.358 --> 20:54.493
Yeah!

20:54.527 --> 20:55.815
I don't get it.

20:56.102 --> 20:57.736
Oh, God damn it.

20:57.978 --> 21:00.014
Here, I thought you were
a life-sucking succubus.

21:00.046 --> 21:01.915
So did my ex-husband.

21:01.948 --> 21:03.707
Well, what... What do you call that?

21:03.754 --> 21:04.885
Varicose vein?

21:05.186 --> 21:07.700
Brenda, listen, dear, I, uh...

21:09.141 --> 21:10.601
I know you're pregnant.

21:11.689 --> 21:13.126
And I know it ain't mine.

21:13.159 --> 21:16.363
Sorry. Really sorry.
