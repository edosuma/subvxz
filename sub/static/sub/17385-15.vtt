Yeah, Bill Murray had
two students in there.

08:44.085 --> 08:45.409
- Yeah.
- And they were trying to predict

08:45.434 --> 08:47.053

- Exactly.

08:47.088 --> 08:48.554

"How can I decrease the
value of these things

15:47.692 --> 15:49.402
"that are hardly worth
anything to begin with?"

15:49.427 --> 15:51.035
[laughter]

15:51.060 --> 15:52.120
So why are you selling 'em?

15:52.145 --> 15:54.057
I mean, it sounds like you
have a lot of affection for it.

15:54.082 --> 15:55.097
Yeah, I do.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.960
Uh, I'm making a move
to a new apartment,

15:56.985 --> 15:59.401
and I could use the cash, honestly.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.825
What were you looking to get for 'em?

16:00.861 --> 16:03.416
I was thinking $600 for the whole set.

16:03.441 --> 16:04.763
Whoa.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.449
Is anybody really charging
that much for this lot?

16:07.474 --> 16:08.900
Yeah, people still collect these.

16:08.945 --> 16:09.988
I think you and I

16:10.013 --> 16:12.114
are the only two people
left on the planet, though,

16:12.139 --> 16:13.611
who have an affection for "Dick Tracy."

16:13.636 --> 16:14.773
I mean, you heard these guys.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.980
- Yeah, they don't appreciate it at all.
- Just rip it to shreds.

16:17.005 --> 16:18.267
It pains me to say this,

16:18.292 --> 16:19.893
because I love this character

16:19.918 --> 16:21.799
and I love this franchise, but...

16:21.824 --> 16:23.691
these are nasty-looking figures.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.410
[laughter]

16:25.435 --> 16:27.721
I don't think we would have
much of an interest in it,

16:27.746 --> 16:28.825
but thanks for bringing 'em in.

16:28.860 --> 16:29.917
Oh, no problem, man.

16:29.942 --> 16:32.557
I love Dick Tracy and seeing
these wonderful figures.

16:32.582 --> 16:34.137
- Thanks, man.
- No, no problem.

16:34.162 --> 16:35.331
Appreciate it, man.

16:35.367 --> 16:36.599
"Werewolf by Night" 32.

16:36.635 --> 16:37.925
The most expensive book

16:37.950 --> 16:40.363
in the "Werewolf" 's 43-issue run.

16:40.707 --> 16:43.608
<i>[upbeat rock music]</i>

16:43.644 --> 16:45.444
<i>♪ ♪</i>

16:46.480 --> 16:49.948
Let's say you had a magic pencil.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.476
Whatever you drew

16:51.511 --> 16:53.244
would materialize in front of you.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.780
- What would you draw?
- Good question.

16:55.816 --> 16:58.222
- I would draw my own comic book store.
- Whoa.

16:58.247 --> 16:59.322
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:59.347 --> 17:01.078
You want to work at
another comic book store?

17:01.103 --> 17:02.621
I want to own my own comic book store.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.816
[laughter]

17:04.840 --> 17:07.480
He draws another comic book
store he could be employed by.

17:08.339 --> 17:09.794
It'd be really sweet, yeah.

17:09.829 --> 17:10.925
I'd draw my own comic book store.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.396
Like, you know, "Ming's
Comic Book World"

17:12.432 --> 17:13.480
or something like that.

17:13.505 --> 17:15.310
Just 'cause you draw a structure

17:15.335 --> 17:18.752
doesn't mean it has
electricity, plumbing...

17:18.777 --> 17:20.576
I can't assume that it's well-stocked

17:20.601 --> 17:22.818
and it's... it's, like,
really awesome on the inside?

17:22.843 --> 17:25.443
You forgot about the finer
details of this magic pencil.

17:25.479 --> 17:26.944
[laughter]

17:26.980 --> 17:29.114
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey. How you doing?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.482
What can we do for you today?

17:30.517 --> 17:33.650
I was eyeing that
"Werewolf by Night" 32.

17:33.675 --> 17:35.963
Want to grab the book for
the man? Hot book, right?

17:35.988 --> 17:38.462
I'm anticipating that it will be, yes.

17:38.487 --> 17:41.072
So, uh, yeah, wanted
to get my hands on that.

17:41.097 --> 17:42.159
- There you go.
- Thank you.

17:42.184 --> 17:43.750
- "Werewolf by Night" 32.
- Oh, yeah.

17:43.775 --> 17:45.862
- First appearance of?
- Both: Moon Knight.

17:45.887 --> 17:47.213
- Nice.
- That's right.

17:47.238 --> 17:48.690
_

17:48.715 --> 17:50.808
_

17:50.833 --> 17:53.557
_

17:55.136 --> 17:57.581
Get it out of the bag
and give it the once-over.

17:57.606 --> 17:58.627
Yeah, sure.

17:58.652 --> 18:00.308
This is "Werewolf by Night" 32.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.730
Easily the most expensive book

18:01.755 --> 18:04.370
in the "Werewolf" 's 43-issue run.

18:04.395 --> 18:07.009
- Not even his number 1?
- Not even his number 1.

18:07.034 --> 18:08.495
- It doesn't even come close.
- Oh.

18:08.695 --> 18:11.662
There's a nice example of
a character being introduced

18:11.687 --> 18:13.245
- in a Marvel monster book.
- Mm-hmm.

18:13.270 --> 18:16.732
And a character then going on
to eclipse the star of the book.

18:16.757 --> 18:19.558
And if they put Moon Knight
in "The Defenders" TV show,

18:19.583 --> 18:22.409
it's just gonna make everybody
go, uh, that much more nuts.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.893
What do you think the
chances are that this...

18:23.918 --> 18:25.963
that this hits, that Moon
Knight becomes a sensation?

18:25.988 --> 18:27.338
I'd say the chances are pretty good.

18:27.363 --> 18:28.464
Moon Knight.

18:28.489 --> 18:30.299
- Marc Spector Moon Knight?
- Yes.

18:30.324 --> 18:32.323
Character's been around
since, when, the '70s?

18:32.348 --> 18:33.549
1975.

18:33.574 --> 18:36.854
And has never broken
through to the mainstream.

18:36.879 --> 18:40.859
But now, with the rumors that
he's about to get that series,

18:40.883 --> 18:43.217
everybody's buying up this book.

18:43.252 --> 18:47.446
Largely dismissed by a
DC fan as Marvel's Batman.

18:47.471 --> 18:48.856
That's how they say it a lot,

18:48.898 --> 18:51.246
but Moon Knight... he's
a billionaire, I believe,

18:51.271 --> 18:53.537
and he's got, you know,
a bunch of toys and tools

18:53.562 --> 18:54.589
just like Bruce Wayne.

18:54.614 --> 18:57.363
He's even got an Alfred called Frenchie.

18:57.388 --> 18:58.754
- But "Were"...
- Is... is he French?

18:58.779 --> 19:00.746
- Yeah, he's... duh, yeah, he's French.
- [laughter]

19:00.771 --> 19:01.918
- "Duh"?
- Wow.

19:01.943 --> 19:04.410
No, he just likes to kiss with tongues.

19:05.152 --> 19:07.386
What's your feeling
on Johnny-come-latelies

19:07.411 --> 19:09.402
like this speculator right here?

19:09.427 --> 19:10.574
Stash loves.

19:10.599 --> 19:12.214
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Stash loves Johnny.

19:12.239 --> 19:13.464
All right, well, not exactly.

19:13.489 --> 19:15.246
Look. When I was a kid, I used to rock

19:15.271 --> 19:18.144
with these old-school
Marvel monster books.

19:18.169 --> 19:19.652
I'm probably be buried

19:19.677 --> 19:21.543
with my 1 through 72, my "Dracula",

19:21.568 --> 19:22.723
- so, just saying.
- All: Ohh.

19:22.748 --> 19:23.949
- Just saying.
- He knows...

19:23.974 --> 19:25.277
He knows the issue run.

19:25.302 --> 19:28.230
Just so happens I'm
here on business today.

19:28.255 --> 19:29.550
That's some cred right there.

19:29.575 --> 19:30.660
- So.
- Ming's shaking.

19:30.685 --> 19:32.371
- He's like, "Oh."
- [laughs]

19:32.396 --> 19:33.876
Please don't fire me and hire him.

19:34.292 --> 19:35.512
I'm saying.

19:35.537 --> 19:37.403
"I haven't drawn my magic
comic book store yet.

19:37.438 --> 19:38.837
"Don't fire me yet."

19:38.873 --> 19:40.506
[laughter]

19:40.738 --> 19:42.841
Have you ever hit any
books that you targeted?

19:42.877 --> 19:45.285
You bought 'em low
and then sold 'em high?

19:45.310 --> 19:47.361
Yeah, I did "New Mutants" 98.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.048
- First Deadpool.
- Oh.

19:49.083 --> 19:51.350
"Batman Adventures" 12. Harley
Quinn's first appearance.

19:51.377 --> 19:52.386
- Ooh.
- Nice.

19:52.411 --> 19:53.956
So when "Suicide Squad" dropped...

19:53.981 --> 19:55.681
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.383
All right, so we're looking
to get, uh, $400 for the book.

19:58.419 --> 19:59.785
Four...?

19:59.810 --> 20:02.340
You got a little stuff happening

20:02.365 --> 20:04.644
- along the binding, though, I mean...
- Mm hmm. Yeah.

20:04.669 --> 20:06.848
Well, you know, a high-grade
issue would fetch now,

20:06.873 --> 20:08.493
you know, close to $700.

20:08.529 --> 20:10.295
Mm. Okay.

20:10.331 --> 20:13.089
I was thinking more like $300.

20:14.034 --> 20:15.879
How about $375?

20:16.043 --> 20:17.816
How about 3 fiddy?

20:17.841 --> 20:19.474
I can do $350.

20:19.499 --> 20:20.849
- All right.
- That's good. Done.

20:20.874 --> 20:22.129
My man.

20:22.675 --> 20:24.230
You want to put back in
the bag for the gentleman?

20:24.255 --> 20:25.441
You got it.

20:25.466 --> 20:27.683
- There you go, sir.
- All right. Thank you.

20:27.708 --> 20:28.925
- Appreciate it.
- It was a pleasure.

20:28.950 --> 20:30.816
- Talk to you later.
- Thank you, fellas.

20:30.851 --> 20:32.417
You ever feel any responsibility,

20:32.453 --> 20:34.653
like, that guy speculating on a book

20:34.688 --> 20:38.056
that may sink in value if
Moon Knight doesn't pan out?

20:38.092 --> 20:40.525
Could be like the big sell-off of '29.

20:40.561 --> 20:42.260
- [laughs]
- 1929?

20:42.296 --> 20:45.339
Yeah, like, he's jumping
off the roof and stuff.

20:45.364 --> 20:47.254
You could throw the
country into a depression,

20:47.279 --> 20:48.412
and you don't think about it, do you?

20:48.437 --> 20:49.739
Caveat emptor, man.

20:49.764 --> 20:52.832
Commies. Commies. The
three of you. Commies.

20:52.857 --> 20:55.231
Oh, that's all the time we
got for this week. Sorry, kids.

20:55.256 --> 20:56.895
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.420
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:58.445 --> 21:00.012
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

21:00.037 --> 21:02.891
Never play baseball with
a kid named Negan, folks.

21:02.916 --> 21:04.239
Good night.
