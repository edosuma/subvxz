WEBVTT

00:30.399 --> 00:35.439
PERFECT LIFE

00:37.759 --> 00:40.600
WHEN IT ALL GOES BACK A LONG WAY

00:50.399 --> 00:51.439
Dear...

00:51.840 --> 00:52.840
What are you doing here?

00:55.799 --> 00:58.560
ONE WEEK BEFORE

00:58.920 --> 01:00.799
He's really changed, hasn't he?

01:02.280 --> 01:03.320
Actually, he has.

01:03.399 --> 01:07.000
Same as me. I was born
with black hair then turned blonde.

01:07.079 --> 01:09.400
I don't mean his hair.
He's like a different baby.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.159
He's cuter.
He's different.

01:11.599 --> 01:12.640
He was cute before.

01:12.719 --> 01:16.319
-He's cute, got a problem with that?
-It's in his genes.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.079
He's falling asleep.

01:22.719 --> 01:24.560
-Shush, he's falling asleep.
-Okay.

01:25.560 --> 01:26.959
What shall we do?

01:27.319 --> 01:28.680
What do you mean?

01:29.159 --> 01:31.319
I don't know...
Now that he's asleep.

01:39.000 --> 01:39.959
What?

01:40.799 --> 01:42.000
Hang on, hang on.

01:42.079 --> 01:43.159
-He's asleep.
-He's moving.

01:43.239 --> 01:44.560
-No, he's asleep.
-Sure?

01:44.640 --> 01:46.480
He's asleep, I promise.

01:53.159 --> 01:54.040
I'm coming.

01:54.120 --> 01:54.840
I'm coming.

01:54.920 --> 01:55.719
Me too.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.359
Did you just fake it?

02:04.920 --> 02:06.359
-Huh?
-You faked it.

02:06.439 --> 02:08.360
-Me?
-You never come like that.

02:08.439 --> 02:11.159
-Well, now I do.
-It's never that tone. Never.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.599
-What tone?
-You faked it.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.919
Are you a musician?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.919
Are you keeping tabs on my moans?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.360
Maria...

02:17.439 --> 02:19.680
-What?
-You can tell me. It's OK.

02:19.759 --> 02:20.680
Did you fake it?

02:22.840 --> 02:24.479
-A bit.
-Jesus...

02:24.560 --> 02:25.800
Just a little bit.

02:25.879 --> 02:29.080
-You can't fake "a little bit".
-You said it was OK.

02:29.159 --> 02:30.520
Did you ever before?

02:31.240 --> 02:33.400
I promise it's the first time.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.240
I haven't come since I gave birth.

02:36.319 --> 02:40.240
Not when I masturbate nor with Xosé.
Never.

02:41.479 --> 02:42.719
Did you tell him?

02:42.800 --> 02:43.960
No.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.360
No, no, no...

02:45.439 --> 02:48.000
I'm embarrassed he'd think
I have a problem.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.639
In what way?

02:50.080 --> 02:51.240
Because I had a baby.

02:51.319 --> 02:55.439
Yes, and that's why I don't want to look
at myself or be looked at...

02:55.520 --> 02:57.599
What do you do during sex?

02:58.800 --> 03:01.560
I don't let him eat me out.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.400
And I fake orgasms.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.800
Why?

03:08.520 --> 03:12.479
Because we're at it, things are hot,
we're good, you know?

03:12.560 --> 03:17.919
I'm embarrassed he might think
something's weird with me and obsess...

03:18.879 --> 03:20.479
Obsess and what else?

03:22.159 --> 03:23.680
And leave me.

03:42.159 --> 03:43.639
Nice...

03:45.360 --> 03:47.319
-Is that my lighter?
-Yeah.

03:47.639 --> 03:49.080
Want a light?

04:04.520 --> 04:05.879
-Hey.
-What?

04:05.960 --> 04:07.639
I was thinking that...

04:08.000 --> 04:10.919
I've got a conference in Valencia
this weekend.

04:12.479 --> 04:15.039
Would it be crazy if you joined me?

04:15.120 --> 04:18.720
We could sort of rent a suite
with a hot tub,

04:19.079 --> 04:20.639
order champagne...

04:21.759 --> 04:22.639
A hot tub?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.800
-A hot tub.
-All right then.

04:25.279 --> 04:26.480
Okay.

04:33.279 --> 04:34.600
Your mother.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.439
-What?
-Your mother is calling.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.199
-Hello.
-Hello, do you have a reservation?

04:47.279 --> 04:49.240
No, I'm meeting someone.

04:49.319 --> 04:50.399
Thank you.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.199
Hi, Mom...

04:57.560 --> 04:59.399
-Hi.
-How are you?

04:59.480 --> 05:00.360
Fine.

05:00.439 --> 05:02.759
-Sorry I'm a bit late.
-It's alright.

05:03.639 --> 05:07.199
How is that renovation coming along,
the one in Gràcia?

05:07.279 --> 05:09.120
The owners are delighted.

05:09.199 --> 05:13.199
We recovered the hydraulic tile floor
and a vaulted ceiling.

05:13.879 --> 05:16.680
I'm thinking of changing
the kitchen floor.

05:17.639 --> 05:18.920
Know what today is?

05:19.519 --> 05:21.000
You had to bring it up.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.319
Please don't start.

05:23.399 --> 05:24.759
Would you like dessert?

05:24.839 --> 05:27.160
Do you have egg flan, your specialty?

05:27.240 --> 05:28.319
-Yes.
-I'll have that.

05:28.399 --> 05:30.720
You have to try it, it's delicious.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.839
I'm so full.
A black coffee for me.

05:33.519 --> 05:34.480
Thanks.

05:36.839 --> 05:38.319
Just like your father.

05:38.399 --> 05:39.600
No dessert.

05:40.959 --> 05:42.720
Have you spoken? How is he?

05:44.439 --> 05:45.959
He's fine, Mom.

05:46.439 --> 05:48.240
How is he getting on with...?

05:48.920 --> 05:50.720
Oh, what was her name?

05:51.959 --> 05:54.839
You know exactly what her name is.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.920
What do you even care?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.160
Well I do care.

05:59.519 --> 06:02.759
He might remember
that today would be our anniversary.

06:04.079 --> 06:07.839
You know what? You don't celebrate
when you're separated.

06:08.199 --> 06:10.759
-If anything, the divorce.
-Divorce is for cowards.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.800
The brave thing is to fight.

06:14.279 --> 06:18.160
If we'd fought a little bit,
we'd still be together.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.439
I wish your father was like Pablo.

06:24.519 --> 06:26.800
Things would be very different.

06:27.399 --> 06:29.920
Because... How are you two?

06:32.240 --> 06:34.199
Fine, Mom. We're fine.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.160
Take care of each other.

06:39.319 --> 06:43.120
Don't do as I did,
don’t neglect the relationship...

06:43.839 --> 06:45.439
It's important.

06:45.519 --> 06:48.240
I can't stand it when you get like this.

06:48.319 --> 06:49.879
I'm going, okay?

06:49.959 --> 06:51.319
My treat.

06:52.360 --> 06:52.920
Bye.

06:57.839 --> 06:59.040
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.800
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

07:00.879 --> 07:01.959
I'm here to see Xosé.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.920
He's in a meeting right now.

07:04.399 --> 07:06.079
-Who are you?
-I'm his girlfriend.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.319
Gosh. I didn't know he had one.

07:09.399 --> 07:10.759
-What a player!
-Yep.

07:10.839 --> 07:12.519
-You're pretty.
-Thanks.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.920
-Do you mind if I wait over there?
-Sure.

07:16.839 --> 07:20.000
You paint with your soul,
your pussy, your dick...

07:20.079 --> 07:22.800
-With emotion, of course.
-Come off it!

07:22.879 --> 07:24.879
Fuck realism.

07:24.959 --> 07:27.120
Screw realism!

07:27.759 --> 07:29.720
Screw it!

07:30.319 --> 07:34.240
It's not a realistic beach,
but you can feel it, right?

07:34.319 --> 07:35.480
-No!
-No way.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.560
What do you see?

07:36.639 --> 07:38.160
Cubist conceptualism

07:38.680 --> 07:42.319
of female sensuality and diversity.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.800
Take that!

07:43.879 --> 07:45.680
I see a beach, definitely.

07:45.759 --> 07:48.240
-He's an ass-licker.
-Who, me?

07:49.199 --> 07:51.879
Ass-licker! Ass-licker!

07:51.959 --> 07:54.040
Ass-licker! Ass-licker!

07:54.120 --> 07:55.439
Bloody hell, my sister.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.800
Did you come to see me?

07:57.879 --> 07:59.040
Xosé, actually.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.839
I didn't know you gave classes.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.519
Haven't you changed!

08:03.120 --> 08:04.319
You're secretive.

08:04.399 --> 08:06.720
Well, there isn't much to tell.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.680
Did she tell you about Julia?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.160
That screws that.

08:10.639 --> 08:13.360
-What happened?
-Nothing, nothing happened.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.079
-Meaning?
-I have to talk to her.

08:17.160 --> 08:17.839
About what?

08:19.560 --> 08:20.399
No!

08:20.480 --> 08:21.199
Esther.

08:21.279 --> 08:24.680
-The wedding is in 20 days.
-I know it is.

08:24.759 --> 08:26.519
-She should tell her.
-Sure.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.600
Guys, I promise I'll tell her today, okay?

08:30.680 --> 08:33.399
When I'm about to tell her, I shit myself.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.120
Not metaphorically,
I literally shit myself.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.639
Pure diarrhea, girl.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.519
-Hang on a sec...
-No, don't say it.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.039
Don't even try.

08:43.120 --> 08:43.960
Hi.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.679
-Hi.
-What brings you here?

08:46.759 --> 08:48.519
-Surprise visit.
-Oh...

08:50.279 --> 08:52.080
How is it going?
How are you?

09:00.600 --> 09:05.000
<i>Juli! I'm going to stay with some folks</i>
<i>watching a movie.</i>

09:05.080 --> 09:08.480
<i>I'll join you later for dessert,</i>
<i>go and have dinner. Don't wait for me.</i>

09:16.559 --> 09:18.360
Will you take the girls tomorrow?

09:18.440 --> 09:20.039
Yes, it's my turn.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.360
CRIS:
What about this weekend then?

09:23.440 --> 09:25.320
ÁLEX:<i> writing...</i>

09:25.399 --> 09:28.919
ÁLEX:
I thought you wouldn't dare. ;-)

09:29.000 --> 09:33.279
CRIS: Maybe you don't dare.

09:33.639 --> 09:36.360
ALEX <i>writing...</i>

09:36.919 --> 09:41.600
ALEX: Give me the details
and I'll buy the tickets.

09:41.919 --> 09:45.480
CRIS:
I'll email them to you tomorrow morning.

09:45.559 --> 09:49.080
Just a second,
I'm sending a ticket, then I'm done...

09:49.159 --> 09:51.240
-Done.
-You're a workaholic.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.559
Gorgeous.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.480
I love who you are.

09:54.559 --> 09:55.919
-I love you.
-Me too.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.360
-Hiya.
-Hi.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.080
-How are you?
-Good.

10:29.159 --> 10:31.480
The film ended late, didn't it?

10:31.559 --> 10:33.639
It wasn't a film.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.559
It was "smoking grass
while watching crap films."

10:39.440 --> 10:41.320
I made that name up.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.960
I just thought you'd be earlier.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.440
Are you angry or what?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.200
No.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.519
Hey...

10:54.440 --> 10:57.080
I was gonna call,
but my battery went.

10:57.159 --> 11:00.080
My cell radically died on me.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.159
Radically...

11:01.240 --> 11:04.519
Well, next time your phone dies
radically...

11:05.320 --> 11:08.159
...you borrow someone else's
and you text me

11:08.240 --> 11:11.159
so I know the Russian mafia
hasn't kidnapped you

11:11.240 --> 11:14.679
and is selling your organs
all over Barcelona.

11:14.759 --> 11:16.200
Seriously?

11:16.279 --> 11:19.120
Who's gonna want the liver of a drunkard?

11:19.759 --> 11:21.000
By the way,

11:21.080 --> 11:25.840
I'm going to have drinks
with the Sants gang on Friday.

11:25.919 --> 11:29.120
And is that for my information
or an invitation?

11:30.039 --> 11:31.360
Do you want to come?

11:33.240 --> 11:36.120
You'll be bored shitless.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.200
-Why?
-They're into <i>trap</i>.

11:38.279 --> 11:40.919
-To what?
-They're always totally wired.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.799
You'll be bored stupid.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.000
-Is <i>trap</i> sort of like rap?
-A hybrid.

11:48.799 --> 11:50.080
A hybrid.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.480
I was thinking...

12:12.559 --> 12:16.639
We could go to one of Juanito's
swimming lessons together.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.200
The three of us?

12:18.279 --> 12:21.080
Sure, and do the exercises together.

12:21.159 --> 12:23.000
A bit weird.
Gari should go.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.279
Gari doesn't want to.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.919
-He's pissed off.
-Right.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.159
It isn't just for parents, you know?

12:28.240 --> 12:30.519
One girl went with her boyfriend.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.039
Right, Juanito?

12:32.120 --> 12:32.879
I don't see it.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.799
All right, then.
We'll go by ourselves.

12:35.879 --> 12:38.080
If you drown, I'll save you.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.240
I'll go.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.480
-But just one day.
-One day.

12:42.559 --> 12:45.039
It's so nice in the tub, right?

12:45.120 --> 12:46.320
Okay.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.720
-We're going to the pool!
-Right.

12:48.799 --> 12:50.200
With Xosé.

12:50.559 --> 12:52.600
This robe smells weird.

12:52.679 --> 12:54.919
-Sort of damp.
-I'll go get another.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.080
Be right back.

13:06.879 --> 13:08.240
Hi, honey.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.000
How was it?

13:12.399 --> 13:14.559
-No, no, I'm having a poo.
-Oh, sorry.

13:14.639 --> 13:17.159
It's okay.
I'll tell you in a sec.

13:17.720 --> 13:18.960
How have you been?

13:19.320 --> 13:20.720
I was listening to <i>trap.</i>

13:23.440 --> 13:24.600
How was it?

13:24.679 --> 13:26.360
People spouting filth

13:26.440 --> 13:29.639
with an electro backing
to make them seem like singers.

13:30.279 --> 13:32.519
So, you thought it was shit.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.240
Well, yeah, that too.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.720
But I'd like to go with you on Friday.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.799
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, and that way...

13:43.879 --> 13:46.519
...I get to know your pals.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.879
If I listen to <i>trap</i> with others
I might understand it.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.320
What did you want to tell me?

13:52.639 --> 13:54.399
I'll make dinner, okay?

13:54.480 --> 13:58.679
Put your feet up...
I'm feeling creative.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.000
Brilliant.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.519
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.120
"Do homework together."

14:12.200 --> 14:14.000
"Sleep in the same bed."

14:14.840 --> 14:16.360
"Four partners each.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.080
Kisses for partners one and two."

14:19.159 --> 14:21.879
This is just a little girl
writing nonsense.

14:21.960 --> 14:26.840
A child who has made a "love contract"
with classmates.

14:26.919 --> 14:28.960
Eight of them. See the signatures?

14:29.039 --> 14:33.080
They made up an ID card number
and took a copy home.

14:33.159 --> 14:36.240
-How formal.
-I know couples can be different.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.240
But different needs to stay
outside the school environment.

14:40.639 --> 14:41.919
Pauli, sweetheart...

14:42.000 --> 14:45.120
We don't have boyfriends and girlfriends.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.200
-Right?
-No, we're a couple.

14:47.279 --> 14:49.039
Then there's you and Martina.

14:49.120 --> 14:52.399
-A team of four.
-Like a football team?

14:52.480 --> 14:55.080
-Yes, that's right.
-That's eleven players.

14:55.159 --> 14:57.919
-Okay, a basketball team.
-Five.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.960
-I want football!
-She wants football.

15:00.039 --> 15:03.480
Okay then...
Listen, we're a football team

15:03.559 --> 15:07.720
with four players,
because seven were kicked out

15:07.799 --> 15:09.559
for foul behavior.

15:09.639 --> 15:10.960
-All right?
-Yes?

15:11.039 --> 15:11.840
Okay.

15:11.919 --> 15:14.720
-Are we a team?
-We're a team!

15:14.799 --> 15:17.120
-Yay! A team!
-Are we a team?

15:17.200 --> 15:18.120
We're a team.

15:18.759 --> 15:19.720
We're a team.

15:19.799 --> 15:21.159
-A team!
-Give me five.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.039
A team!

15:22.120 --> 15:23.799
Who doesn't want dessert?

15:24.559 --> 15:27.720
You cheated.
You said "who doesn't want."

15:27.799 --> 15:30.080
Let's see if you can do this.

15:30.559 --> 15:31.960
Look. Pay attention.

15:32.039 --> 15:32.519
Wow!

15:34.320 --> 15:35.799
That was beautiful.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.639
<i>...so much...</i>
<i>I just remember it...</i>

16:05.200 --> 16:07.399
<i>...and I get so hot...</i>

16:07.879 --> 16:11.279
<i>-Luckily, I've got the stone.</i>
<i>-Stone? What stone?</i>

16:11.720 --> 16:13.360
Stop it...

16:13.879 --> 16:15.919
Stop or we'll miss the end.

16:17.000 --> 16:17.759
Great.

16:17.840 --> 16:22.279
-The girls could come downstairs.
-They're asleep.

16:22.879 --> 16:25.559
You used to love doing it on the couch.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.440
What are you doing?

16:30.720 --> 16:32.519
It's as hard as a rock.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.559
Hang on, hang on...

16:50.080 --> 16:51.879
-Like it?
-Yeah.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.120
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.920
When does your train leave?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.920
At five-thirty.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.359
I'll be going straight from work.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.880
Okay.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.279
Take advantage and relax.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.279
Okay. I'll miss you guys.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.640
I'm going to jump in the shower.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.839
Okay.

17:26.599 --> 17:27.799
I'm over the moon.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.200
-Hello.
-Hello.

17:29.279 --> 17:30.559
We've come for BP 2.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.240
Your baby's name?

17:32.319 --> 17:34.400
-Juanito.
-Okay, locker four.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.160
And number eight for you.

17:36.240 --> 17:36.839
Thanks.

17:36.920 --> 17:37.960
-Have fun.
-Thanks.

17:47.079 --> 17:48.279
-Shall we go?
-Yeah.

17:54.279 --> 17:55.240
Look, Juanito.

17:55.319 --> 17:56.960
We're with Xosé.

17:57.039 --> 17:58.079
Come on.

18:06.839 --> 18:08.160
Aren't you coming in?

18:09.519 --> 18:10.160
I can't.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.200
You can't what?

18:12.279 --> 18:15.400
I got divorced because I didn't want kids.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.880
And look at me... Look where I am.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.680
At a swimming lesson
for your partner's baby.

18:20.759 --> 18:23.279
-I'm being his dad.
-No, you're not.

18:23.359 --> 18:24.920
-Yes, I am.
-No.

18:25.000 --> 18:25.559
I'm going, okay?

18:26.559 --> 18:28.440
I'll wait for you outside.
We'll talk later.

18:29.359 --> 18:30.480
Bye.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.400
It's a question of...

18:38.480 --> 18:40.079
I know we're good together.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.079
The relationship is cool,

18:42.160 --> 18:43.759
we have chemistry...

18:43.839 --> 18:46.279
We feel comfortable and relaxed.
I know that.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.039
But the other thing gets to you.

18:48.119 --> 18:50.640
You feel like you're being his father.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.200
You're not, but that's what you feel.

18:53.279 --> 18:56.960
He's a baby, he comes with me everywhere,
so it looks like it to you.

18:57.039 --> 18:59.799
But later on he'll have babysitters
and things.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.279
I know that our relationship is cool.

19:02.359 --> 19:04.680
But this really gets to you.

19:04.759 --> 19:07.319
It stresses you, makes you anxious,
angry too.

19:07.400 --> 19:11.720
There'll even be times
when you want to quit the relationship.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.519
Bye, have a nice day.

19:34.319 --> 19:36.359
Hi. Where are you?

19:38.759 --> 19:39.599
What?

19:39.680 --> 19:41.720
No, sure, don't worry.

19:42.039 --> 19:44.359
Work comes first.
I completely understand.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.759
No, of course. Take the call...

19:46.839 --> 19:48.200
Okay, kisses.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.160
What's up, crazy hoes?

20:00.960 --> 20:02.680
What's up, bitch?

20:03.519 --> 20:06.160
-Long time no see.
-What's your name?

20:06.240 --> 20:08.599
<i>-Julia.</i>
<i>-Do you use menstrual cups?</i>

20:08.680 --> 20:09.799
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-No, okay.</i>

20:09.880 --> 20:12.400
<i>Mine got lost in my pussy for two days.</i>

20:12.480 --> 20:13.759
<i>I forgot I had it!</i>

20:13.839 --> 20:14.799
Hi, Brenda.

20:15.759 --> 20:16.519
Julia.

20:16.599 --> 20:17.960
Do you smoke?

20:19.000 --> 20:19.960
Okay.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.640
-That was some drag.
-You've got competition! Bravo!

20:26.359 --> 20:27.599
Go ahead, tastes great.

20:29.240 --> 20:32.119
Hi.
I have a reservation for Cristina Linares.

20:57.519 --> 20:58.839
Getting married?

21:00.880 --> 21:03.160
-You're marrying!
-Celebration time!

21:03.240 --> 21:04.920
Line them up!

21:06.200 --> 21:07.359
Dude!

21:07.440 --> 21:08.920
Awesome!

21:13.319 --> 21:14.240
Bravo!

21:32.160 --> 21:33.319
Hi, Mom.

21:33.680 --> 21:38.000
Fine.
I'm here at a conference in Valencia.

21:38.839 --> 21:43.160
I just wanted to say that I was rude
the other day at lunch.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.359
I'm sorry.

21:44.440 --> 21:48.200
You have a right to be sad when you want.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.160
Okay.

21:52.039 --> 21:53.480
Love you, Mommy.

23:06.599 --> 23:07.920
Dear...

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
What are you doing here?

23:10.880 --> 23:12.119
I can't take it anymore.
