00:01.030 --> 00:02.530
<i>Previously on "Tyrant"...</i>

00:02.565 --> 00:07.570
I demand to sit down with
President Jamal Al Fayeed.

00:07.605 --> 00:09.240
He demands?

00:09.275 --> 00:10.400
This is it.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.210
You can finish something
our father couldn't.

00:12.245 --> 00:13.210
Where should we start?

00:13.245 --> 00:15.940
If you allow
there to be open and free

00:15.950 --> 00:19.280
elections for the office
of president of Abbudin.

00:19.315 --> 00:21.950
The constitution does
not call for these elections.

00:21.985 --> 00:24.120
And in fact, may have created
for ourselves the mechanism of

00:24.155 --> 00:25.950
our own demise.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.450
No hello?

00:27.460 --> 00:29.290
No "I missed you"?

00:29.325 --> 00:31.390
There are people that
have come from all over the world

00:31.425 --> 00:34.300
to see you do what you are
about to do. You are making

00:34.335 --> 00:35.300
history today.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.960
Well, Sheik Rashid may
have been trying to stir the pot

01:43.970 --> 01:47.870
when he called you Jamal's lion
tamer, but he wasn't wrong, huh?

01:47.905 --> 01:49.940
Can we all stop
talking about that?

01:49.975 --> 01:51.940
A lot of people in this room...

01:51.975 --> 01:54.510
would've never believed

01:54.545 --> 01:56.480
that he'd go for this
kind of political reform.

01:56.515 --> 01:58.910
And if you hadn't brought him
to the table, I suspect some of

01:58.945 --> 02:01.650
them might have
forced the issue.

02:01.685 --> 02:05.620
What do you mean,
"forced the issue"?

02:05.655 --> 02:08.560
Jamal's lucky you're here.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.320
Let's leave it at that.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.660
Don't underestimate
my brother.

02:16.950 --> 02:19.120
Sheik Rashid just
collapsed in the men's room.

02:19.155 --> 02:20.320
They're saying he's dead.

02:20.355 --> 02:22.390
Jesus.

02:22.425 --> 02:24.050
What happened?

02:24.060 --> 02:25.090
He must have fallen.

02:25.590 --> 02:26.620
He's not breathing.

02:26.655 --> 02:27.790
No, no, no!

02:27.825 --> 02:28.790
You don't touch my father!

02:28.825 --> 02:29.990
- We're both doctors.
- He needs help.

02:30.025 --> 02:30.750
Ihab, Ihab, please.

02:34.805 --> 02:36.770
His forehead is contused.

02:36.805 --> 02:39.270
You, you, you saw no one
coming in and out of here

02:39.305 --> 02:40.270
after my father, hmm?

02:40.305 --> 02:41.140
No, sir.

02:41.175 --> 02:41.770
No one?!

02:41.805 --> 02:44.340
I want full access to
the security videos.

02:44.375 --> 02:48.710
Ihab... I'll personally make
sure you get everything you need.

02:48.745 --> 02:51.010
Wait, wait, I got a pulse.

02:51.020 --> 02:53.590
It's thready, but it's definitely
there. He's in respiratory arrest.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.120
How far out are the EMTs?

02:55.155 --> 02:56.220
They're coming up now.

02:56.255 --> 02:57.190
Okay, begin CPR.

02:57.225 --> 02:58.490
Someone keep his neck stable.

02:58.590 --> 03:00.360
Give me your phone, I'll page Dr.
Mansour.

03:00.395 --> 03:01.830
He's Chief of Neurology
at the hospital.

03:03.265 --> 03:04.330
You're at the airport?

03:04.365 --> 03:07.300
I'm about to make
my connection in Heathrow.

03:07.700 --> 03:08.770
I almost missed my flight...

03:08.805 --> 03:11.970
Saved by mechanical
trouble again.

03:12.005 --> 03:13.700
How's that for dumb luck?

03:13.710 --> 03:16.440
Sorry, it's in here somewhere.

03:16.475 --> 03:18.710
Hey, Aunt Jenna's coming.

03:18.745 --> 03:19.540
Here?

03:19.550 --> 03:20.380
When?

03:20.415 --> 03:21.310
Now.

03:21.510 --> 03:23.750
Aw, you got
to hand it to her.

03:23.785 --> 03:26.980
The thing is, this really isn't
such a good to visit.

03:27.180 --> 03:29.690
Oh, and, Em...
don't tell your mother.

03:29.725 --> 03:31.420
I want to surprise her.

03:31.455 --> 03:33.990
Because you know how
much Mom loves surprises.

03:34.025 --> 03:35.730
Love you, guys.

03:35.765 --> 03:37.860
Very excited.

03:40.765 --> 03:43.530
Bring it to me.

03:43.540 --> 03:47.540
Because I want to
see it for myself.

03:48.945 --> 03:50.470
Hmm.

03:50.480 --> 03:55.450
My people have reviewed the
security video from the hotel.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.250
And?

03:56.285 --> 04:02.550
And... Father was alone...
in the bathroom.

04:04.825 --> 04:05.890
You seem disappointed.

04:05.925 --> 04:06.660
No.

04:06.695 --> 04:07.660
Ihab.

04:07.695 --> 04:10.330
There's been no
evidence of foul play.

04:10.365 --> 04:12.300
I don't trust the Al Fayeeds.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.670
Those Al Fayeeds just
saved our father's life.

04:28.945 --> 04:31.480
Are you coming?

04:31.515 --> 04:35.750
And pretend to be concerned
about the sheik's well-being?

04:37.660 --> 04:43.530
Maybe this is Allah's way of telling
you how foolish this election is.

04:43.565 --> 04:44.700
You finished?

04:44.735 --> 04:48.430
Take me back
to the Palace.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.800
There was significant
subdural swelling,

04:54.810 --> 04:58.070
so we had to induce a coma to
relieve the pressure on the

04:58.080 --> 05:01.110
brain stem, so his condition
is stable, at least for now.

05:01.145 --> 05:05.850
So... from everyth...

05:06.120 --> 05:13.290
from... everything you have
seen, you are sure he fell?

05:13.325 --> 05:16.730
We won't know exactly what
happened until he is conscious.

05:16.765 --> 05:20.200
Usually the drugs take 24 hours
to wear off and then we will get

05:20.235 --> 05:22.330
a sense of really what
we are looking at here.

05:22.740 --> 05:23.730
But he will wake up?

05:23.740 --> 05:27.870
Look, he is not young and
he has preexisting medical issues.

05:27.905 --> 05:31.540
But if there are no further
complications, I am reasonably

05:31.575 --> 05:33.880
hopeful that he will
regain consciousness.

05:33.915 --> 05:38.320
Out of respect for your
father's condition, I have

05:38.355 --> 05:39.580
postponed the signing.

05:39.590 --> 05:45.720
If there is anything you need,
anything at all, just ask.

05:45.755 --> 05:49.890
I have put the hospital
staff on notice as well.

05:50.300 --> 05:50.830
Thank you.

05:50.865 --> 05:54.160
Thank you, Mr. President.

05:54.170 --> 05:59.200
May I have a word, Bassam?

06:13.550 --> 06:19.560
So... the doctor said
he could still wake up?

06:19.595 --> 06:22.660
He could, but given
his age, it's, you know...

06:22.695 --> 06:25.400
So, you don't think so?

06:25.435 --> 06:28.430
Jamal, I don't know.

06:28.465 --> 06:33.670
If you were to
guess 50-50, 60-40?

06:34.070 --> 06:36.070
Is this why you
brought me in here?

06:36.105 --> 06:40.010
I needed 100%.

06:40.045 --> 06:43.850
Look, I want
him to wake up, too, but, uh,

06:43.885 --> 06:46.080
he's an old man, so...

06:48.420 --> 06:51.520
I need it to be 100%

06:51.555 --> 06:53.620
that he doesn't.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.260
Why?

06:55.295 --> 06:57.750
What difference
does it make?

06:57.785 --> 06:59.700
It's what I need.

06:59.735 --> 07:02.630
He just can't wake up.

07:02.665 --> 07:04.600
Who knows what
he's going to say.

07:04.635 --> 07:12.140
He could lie... Try and blame everything
that's happened to him on me.

07:12.175 --> 07:15.150
Jamal, what did you do?

07:15.185 --> 07:18.350
He was mocking me.

07:18.385 --> 07:21.320
Okay.

07:21.355 --> 07:24.990
So, what did you do?

07:26.960 --> 07:30.190
When the sheik wakes up,
what is he going to say?

07:30.200 --> 07:33.130
He's not going
to wake up, Bassam.

07:33.165 --> 07:35.300
You're my brother.

07:35.335 --> 07:38.700
I need you to see to it.

07:38.735 --> 07:42.440
I already took care of the
security video at the hotel.

07:42.475 --> 07:43.270
Oh, my God.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.780
The sheiks trust you.

07:45.815 --> 07:48.780
They think you saved
their father's life.

07:48.815 --> 07:55.190
You just slip into the room... give
him something... finish the job.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.990
I'll sign the amendment.

07:58.025 --> 08:04.960
We'll hold the elections, just like
you planned, just like you want.

08:04.995 --> 08:07.200
Do you hear yourself?

08:07.235 --> 08:08.750
Fine.

08:08.785 --> 08:10.930
Let's just let him wake up.

08:10.940 --> 08:15.570
Tell his story, forget
your precious elections.

08:15.605 --> 08:18.340
Let's have a civil war.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.680
This what you want?

08:27.020 --> 08:30.620
You know what I want?

08:34.590 --> 08:36.830
I want to go home.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.970
I'm done here.

08:42.005 --> 08:43.600
Fine. Go.

08:43.635 --> 08:47.700
Run away, Bassam,
like you always do.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.510
It's all your fault anyway.

08:52.545 --> 08:58.320
These elections
were a stupid idea.

08:58.355 --> 09:06.860
All the king's horses and
all the king's men...

09:06.895 --> 09:09.330
I finally get it, Jamal.

09:09.365 --> 09:12.960
I do.

09:12.970 --> 09:16.330
You're broken.

09:16.340 --> 09:20.040
And I can't fix you.

11:23.210 --> 11:26.880
I'm not normally
superstitious, Jamal, I don't

11:26.915 --> 11:33.290
believe in signs or symbols, but...
this accident could be an omen

11:33.325 --> 11:34.620
we should heed.

11:34.655 --> 11:39.930
Did you know we have
a compound in the Maldives?

11:39.965 --> 11:44.230
Did you hear
what I just said?

11:44.265 --> 11:48.940
This is an opportunity for you to
call off these ridiculous elections.

11:48.975 --> 11:54.470
It just sits there,
untouched, unoccupied.

11:54.480 --> 12:02.080
Palm trees... swaying
in the wind.

12:02.115 --> 12:09.160
I was 11 the last
time I was there.

12:09.195 --> 12:16.330
I spent the whole
day making this.

12:16.365 --> 12:23.100
That's the last time I
felt completely free.

12:23.135 --> 12:24.540
We should go.

12:24.575 --> 12:27.610
Tonight.

12:27.645 --> 12:30.540
To the Maldives?

12:31.915 --> 12:34.780
We can lay
on the beach naked.

12:34.815 --> 12:37.480
No one will even
know who we are.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.890
We'll be anonymous.

12:40.925 --> 12:45.360
Why would you
want to be anonymous?

12:45.395 --> 12:49.060
You are an Al Fayeed.

12:49.095 --> 12:54.870
In my lifetime, I
have killed seven people.

12:54.905 --> 12:58.370
Did you know that?

12:58.405 --> 13:00.410
Seven.

13:00.445 --> 13:06.180
Six... on the field of battle.

13:06.215 --> 13:09.420
One in a bar in Tangiers.

13:09.455 --> 13:15.560
One of my own men called
my father an exterminator.

13:15.595 --> 13:20.560
I crushed his skull
with a table leg.

13:20.595 --> 13:23.160
Why are you
telling me this?

13:23.195 --> 13:28.430
Because I want you to
know I know how to kill a man.

13:28.440 --> 13:35.740
I know what death feels
like when it's present.

13:35.775 --> 13:46.550
I think I must have confused the
smell of old age... of infirmity...

13:46.585 --> 13:48.350
with death.

13:48.360 --> 13:55.230
When I heard the sound his skull
made against the tile, I was

13:55.265 --> 13:58.460
sure he was dead.

14:03.775 --> 14:08.710
Apparently I... I was wrong.

14:11.950 --> 14:18.250
It wasn't even something I planned.

14:18.285 --> 14:20.890
Oh, my God, Jamal.

14:20.925 --> 14:27.130
If he wakes up, everyone will
know this horrible thing I did.

14:31.060 --> 14:33.130
It's not horrible.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.910
It's beautiful.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.270
That man?

14:41.280 --> 14:43.440
That is the man I married.

14:43.475 --> 14:46.180
Jamal doesn't give power.

14:46.215 --> 14:47.910
He takes power.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.320
And if the people rise up,
you'll bring them down.

14:51.355 --> 14:59.660
And if the world hates us, you'll
just build a beautiful new hospital.

14:59.695 --> 15:02.130
Bassam says I'm broken.

15:02.165 --> 15:05.460
Bassam has been poisoning
your mind with foolish ideas.

15:05.470 --> 15:08.630
We don't need him.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.540
We can do anything together.

15:11.575 --> 15:16.880
Well... let's
go to the Maldives.

15:16.915 --> 15:17.880
Tonight.

15:17.915 --> 15:21.480
I'll call for the plane.

15:21.515 --> 15:23.520
Where's the telephone?

15:23.555 --> 15:25.150
Jamal.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.120
What's wrong with you?

15:27.155 --> 15:32.460
We are in the middle of a
crisis, we can't just leave.

15:32.495 --> 15:33.660
Why not?

15:33.695 --> 15:37.730
You just said we can
do anything we want.

15:37.765 --> 15:40.870
I need to prepare a
draft for the speech when the

15:40.905 --> 15:45.740
sheik dies or... for
when he doesn't.

15:45.775 --> 15:49.380
You had enough.

16:08.530 --> 16:10.530
Hey.

16:10.565 --> 16:14.500
I'm, uh, sorry I ran away
without saying good-bye.

16:14.535 --> 16:16.500
I understand.

16:16.535 --> 16:20.410
Honey, uh, the sheik seems
to have stabilized a bit.

16:20.445 --> 16:22.140
Brain swelling's down slightly.

16:22.175 --> 16:24.540
So that's good news.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.910
Yeah.
Yeah, good news.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.520
Listen, we're shorthanded.

16:29.555 --> 16:33.920
I'm probably pulling an
all-nighter, if you can believe it.

16:33.955 --> 16:36.090
Sure, uh,
we'll talk tomorrow.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.290
Okay.

16:37.325 --> 16:39.090
Hey, Barry?

16:39.125 --> 16:41.090
It's gonna be okay.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.130
I love you.

16:43.165 --> 16:46.970
I love you, too.

16:47.005 --> 16:49.970
Molly?

16:54.780 --> 16:56.110
You look tired.

16:56.145 --> 17:01.010
It's, uh...
It's been a bad day.

17:11.260 --> 17:15.130
What happened
to Sheik Rashid?

17:15.165 --> 17:20.130
Are we absolutely sure that
there was no foul play?

17:20.165 --> 17:23.470
What are you
talking about?

17:23.505 --> 17:28.610
Do you think what
happened today was an accident?

17:28.645 --> 17:33.910
Why would
you ask me that?

17:33.920 --> 17:39.190
20 years ago, your
father tried to sit down with

17:39.225 --> 17:42.420
Sheik Rashid to end a civil war.

17:42.455 --> 17:45.860
Just as you are doing now.

17:45.895 --> 17:52.430
And just as happened to
you, fate intervened.

17:53.465 --> 17:55.640
What do you
mean, fate intervened?

17:55.675 --> 17:58.800
The Rashids bombed an army
barracks and my father responded

17:58.835 --> 17:59.910
by gassing his own people.

17:59.945 --> 18:01.840
- Is that what you call fate?
- That's not what happened.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.440
Really?

18:03.475 --> 18:06.810
History is almost never the story
of what actually happened, Bassam.

18:06.845 --> 18:10.250
It wasn't Sheik Rashid or his
followers who bombed our soldiers.

18:10.285 --> 18:11.480
Then, who was it?

18:11.490 --> 18:14.190
Your Uncle Tariq.

18:14.225 --> 18:17.990
He bombed his own barracks
and blamed the sheik.

18:18.025 --> 18:20.460
All in order to scuttle
the peace talks.

18:20.495 --> 18:22.130
I don't believe you.

18:22.165 --> 18:25.300
And when your father
refused to take the bait,

18:25.335 --> 18:31.140
Tariq gassed Ma'an without
your father's consent.

18:31.175 --> 18:36.540
You knew this whole time...
and you didn't tell me?

18:42.500 --> 18:46.470
I have spent my entire
life ashamed of my father.

18:46.505 --> 18:49.000
Hating him for something
you now say he didn't do.

18:49.010 --> 18:50.340
Bassam.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.540
I... I always knew that
the Al Fayeeds had a special

18:52.575 --> 18:59.950
- talent for cruelty, but this...
- Your father forbade me.

18:59.985 --> 19:05.790
And he was afraid that knowing the
truth would put you in danger.

19:09.030 --> 19:15.260
Tariq is the most
dangerous man you know.

19:17.670 --> 19:20.700
It is entirely within the realm
of possibility that he tried to

19:20.735 --> 19:23.670
kill the sheik.

19:28.110 --> 19:30.850
Tariq didn't
kill the sheik, Mother.

19:30.885 --> 19:34.650
How can you be sure?

19:34.685 --> 19:38.220
Because the
sheik would be dead.

19:43.230 --> 19:46.860
Does Jamal know?

19:46.895 --> 19:48.230
No.

19:48.265 --> 19:54.670
Besides you and Tariq, who
else knows the truth about Ma'an?

19:54.705 --> 19:55.700
I understand.

19:55.735 --> 19:58.140
Don't worry.

19:58.175 --> 19:59.240
He's here now.

19:59.275 --> 20:01.310
My mother?

20:03.580 --> 20:05.880
- Bassam...
- How... How did you

20:05.915 --> 20:08.580
work alongside my uncle
all these years?

20:08.590 --> 20:11.290
H... How does he say something about
the weather or...

20:11.325 --> 20:13.190
or what you had for
lunch and you smile?

20:13.225 --> 20:16.330
To survive, you
do what you have to do.

20:17.865 --> 20:22.130
So... So it turns out that
my... my father was the soft one.

20:22.165 --> 20:23.400
The man of peace.

20:23.435 --> 20:25.530
So far as he could be.

20:25.565 --> 20:28.870
So far as this
place would allow.

20:28.905 --> 20:32.010
I'm so sorry, Bassam.

20:32.045 --> 20:35.880
He died knowing
that I hated him.

20:35.915 --> 20:39.050
Maybe you can finally
come to terms with him.

20:39.085 --> 20:40.280
No.

20:40.315 --> 20:43.990
No, he... he makes even less sense
to me now than he did before

20:44.025 --> 20:46.960
he was... he was cold, he
was cruel, he was distant.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.390
He humiliated Jamal.

20:48.425 --> 20:50.690
And look how well my
brother learned from him.

20:50.725 --> 20:53.900
He put a gun in my hand
when I was ten years old.

20:53.935 --> 20:56.330
As I recall, you
picked up the gun yourself.

20:56.365 --> 21:00.070
To save my brother.

21:00.105 --> 21:04.070
Now, h... how does a man that works
for peace make his child

21:04.105 --> 21:05.310
into a murderer?

21:05.345 --> 21:09.340
To prepare you for the
world you were born into.

21:09.350 --> 21:11.310
To teach you the rules.

21:11.345 --> 21:13.920
Those who are feared make peace.

21:13.955 --> 21:16.320
Those who are not get killed.

21:16.355 --> 21:20.920
That's why your father and your
uncle could work together,

21:20.955 --> 21:24.690
even after the betrayal.

21:24.725 --> 21:28.930
Your father could be kind
because your uncle was cruel.

21:28.965 --> 21:31.700
- No. No, it's...
- No, what?

21:31.735 --> 21:33.940
It's not neat?

21:33.975 --> 21:37.240
It's not simple?

21:37.275 --> 21:39.910
Here nothing is black and white.

21:39.945 --> 21:42.080
Nothing!

21:42.115 --> 21:45.710
So this makes
sense to you, does it?

21:45.720 --> 21:50.120
In its way, yes.

21:50.155 --> 21:53.990
And the man I killed,
how do I make sense of that?

22:00.260 --> 22:03.130
Malik Hassad.

22:03.165 --> 22:05.930
That was the name
of the man I shot.

22:05.940 --> 22:08.300
I remember.

22:08.310 --> 22:12.340
I want you to get me
the address of his family.

22:16.815 --> 22:19.350
Hey, you.

22:19.385 --> 22:21.720
I thought our date was Tuesday.

22:21.755 --> 22:25.390
I needed a vacation.

22:27.790 --> 22:31.330
Well, I'm glad that I was home.

22:31.365 --> 22:35.800
I had to get away from everyone
who expects something from me.

22:35.835 --> 22:40.540
Well, you
can hide inside me.

22:46.980 --> 22:50.750
Shut... the front... door.

22:50.785 --> 22:54.750
Shut the solid gold,
ivory-inlaid front...

22:54.785 --> 22:57.750
This is so much
nicer than my studio.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.560
Though I do have a great
view of a bus stop.

23:00.595 --> 23:03.060
Yeah, I guess it
takes some getting used to.

23:03.095 --> 23:04.690
It's funny.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.130
I never thought your dad
was that great of a catch.

23:08.165 --> 23:10.200
Not that you're
the best judge.

23:10.235 --> 23:12.770
That is so true.

23:12.805 --> 23:14.500
So where's your mom?

23:14.510 --> 23:15.540
The hospital.

23:15.575 --> 23:17.770
Started working there
a couple weeks ago.

23:17.805 --> 23:21.580
Of course she did.

23:21.615 --> 23:24.180
You know what I just realized?

23:24.215 --> 23:28.420
I've never been the guest
of a dictator before.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.630
That was something.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.440
No.

23:45.475 --> 23:49.270
What, you
don't think so?

23:50.780 --> 23:58.610
Whatever demons you're exorcizing, I
wish they haunted you every time.

23:58.620 --> 24:08.060
If I... weren't president...
would you say that?

24:08.095 --> 24:09.140
What?

24:09.175 --> 24:11.340
Would you flatter me?

24:11.350 --> 24:18.350
Would I be here, with you, like
this, if I wasn't the president?

24:18.385 --> 24:21.490
What kind of
a question is that?

24:21.525 --> 24:25.930
Would you be here with
me if I wasn't pretty?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.930
I mean, we are who we are.

24:27.965 --> 24:30.160
I don't know.

24:30.170 --> 24:32.970
So it matters to you.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.500
That you're the president?

24:35.535 --> 24:38.340
I couldn't care less.

24:38.375 --> 24:43.360
In here, you're just a man
that I love being with.

24:43.395 --> 24:45.300
That's good.

24:45.335 --> 24:50.070
Because I don't really
like being president.

24:50.105 --> 24:52.870
I don't think it's good for me.

24:55.005 --> 24:57.240
I'm not very good at it.

24:57.275 --> 25:05.950
I would walk away from all of this
in a heartbeat and never look back.

25:10.390 --> 25:13.820
Have you ever been
to the Maldives?

25:13.830 --> 25:15.060
The Maldives?

25:15.095 --> 25:20.630
They are islands in the
middle of the Indian Ocean...

25:20.665 --> 25:22.000
Mm-hmm.

25:22.035 --> 25:25.440
with the most beautiful
beaches you've ever seen.

25:25.475 --> 25:30.340
Miles, Katerina, miles of
white sand, gentle waves.

25:32.745 --> 25:36.350
Would you come with me?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.530
Stop teasing me.

25:40.440 --> 25:44.040
I show you something.

25:59.020 --> 26:07.030
I made this when I was...
11 years old.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.460
It's beautiful.

26:09.495 --> 26:14.130
What if we went there
together and never came back?

26:14.140 --> 26:16.070
Mmm.

26:16.105 --> 26:18.640
What would you miss?

26:18.675 --> 26:21.780
Um, I'd miss my cat.

26:21.815 --> 26:23.680
Okay.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.780
Ask me what I would miss.

26:26.815 --> 26:28.480
The country?

26:28.515 --> 26:31.120
The people?

26:31.155 --> 26:33.650
I wouldn't miss them.

26:33.660 --> 26:36.420
Not for a second.

26:36.455 --> 26:38.690
That can't be true.

26:38.725 --> 26:40.830
You know what I miss?

26:40.865 --> 26:44.760
I miss me.

26:44.770 --> 26:48.500
I miss me being happy.

26:48.535 --> 26:54.210
Well, how do you know the
Maldives would make you happy?

26:54.245 --> 27:00.210
Because that's
the last time I was happy.

27:05.890 --> 27:10.460
I'm still the president.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.690
Say yes.

27:31.710 --> 27:34.880
Please, I have a family.

27:34.915 --> 27:36.880
No, please.

27:36.915 --> 27:39.390
No.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.690
Please.

28:19.430 --> 28:22.290
Hi, uh, I'm
sorry to bother you.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.030
I'm looking for the
family of Malik Hassad.

28:25.065 --> 28:27.570
Oh, they don't
live here anymore.

28:27.605 --> 28:30.140
Not for a long time.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.640
Do you know
what happened to them?

28:32.675 --> 28:37.240
The father was
shot for being a traitor?

28:37.250 --> 28:38.610
Yeah.

28:38.645 --> 28:43.750
Yeah, I heard, um... What
about his wife and children?

28:43.785 --> 28:45.450
Uh, they moved away.

28:45.485 --> 28:48.650
Afraid the government would
come looking for them.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.890
Right.

28:50.925 --> 28:53.390
The family that moved in
after were all killed in the

28:53.425 --> 28:54.660
gas attack.

28:54.695 --> 28:56.630
All around here,
all these houses.

28:56.665 --> 29:00.130
Everyone died.

29:00.165 --> 29:02.000
But not the Hassads.

29:02.035 --> 29:04.070
They escaped.

30:12.535 --> 30:13.310
Don't say it.

30:13.345 --> 30:14.670
I know.

30:14.680 --> 30:18.680
I thought I
was seeing things.

30:18.715 --> 30:20.110
It's been a long time.

30:20.145 --> 30:23.220
It feels
good, doesn't it?

30:27.220 --> 30:29.820
Why are you here, Bassam?

30:29.855 --> 30:33.330
Why today?

30:33.365 --> 30:38.030
I finally reached
my tipping point.

30:38.065 --> 30:43.670
You know, I... I
heard about the sheik.

30:43.705 --> 30:47.240
I know how much you
invested in this.

30:47.275 --> 30:51.840
You think you get a
handle on this place, you...

30:51.850 --> 30:55.680
you think you know how to get
from point "A" to point "B."

30:55.715 --> 30:59.920
And then it punishes you
for your arrogance.

30:59.955 --> 31:03.190
It is an unwinnable game.

31:03.225 --> 31:08.090
Oh, you don't know that.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.560
This game is not over yet.

31:11.570 --> 31:15.000
Bassam, this place is messy.

31:15.300 --> 31:20.210
And I don't know how tomorrow
will be, and... and when the sun

31:20.245 --> 31:22.910
goes down, it will set on
a thousand things

31:22.945 --> 31:26.510
that I could never
have predicted.

31:26.545 --> 31:31.920
But since you came home, my friend,
I'm looking forward to it.

31:31.955 --> 31:33.520
Tomorrow.

31:33.555 --> 31:36.920
With hope.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.830
For the first time in
20 years, I have hope.

31:40.865 --> 31:42.090
Oh, don't say that.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.500
It's true.

31:44.535 --> 31:48.430
Forget about certainty.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.500
Hope is enough.

32:03.820 --> 32:05.820
This place is amazing.

32:05.855 --> 32:07.990
Your life is amazing.

32:08.025 --> 32:10.160
It's very complicated.

32:10.195 --> 32:12.630
Everyone's
life is complicated.

32:12.665 --> 32:14.990
Mine's complicated and boring.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.760
Complicated and
intermittently depressing.

32:17.770 --> 32:18.960
You should get some perspective.

32:18.970 --> 32:21.400
I know, I
have perspective.

32:21.435 --> 32:24.470
Emma and Sammy told me
all about what you're doing.

32:24.505 --> 32:26.470
You're hardly just
a doctor, sis.

32:26.505 --> 32:28.810
All the work with the World
Health Organization.

32:28.845 --> 32:30.140
And Barry's political stuff.

32:30.175 --> 32:33.080
You were always
way too modest.

32:37.950 --> 32:41.620
I'm actually really
happy to see your face.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.620
It feels a little bit like home.

32:43.655 --> 32:47.360
It hasn't been easy here
these past couple months.

32:47.395 --> 32:50.430
I mean, I thought I was coming
here on vacation, you know?

32:50.465 --> 32:53.030
For a week.

32:53.065 --> 32:55.370
Well, it's going a
lot better now.

32:55.405 --> 32:58.500
I think we found our footing, all
of us, and it'll be good

32:58.510 --> 33:00.640
for Sammy and Emma
that you're here.

33:00.675 --> 33:01.740
I'd like to stay.

33:01.775 --> 33:03.540
Yeah, of course.

33:03.575 --> 33:04.640
I'm not gonna put
you in a hotel.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.850
We have plenty of room.

33:05.885 --> 33:07.610
<i>Plenty of rooms.</i>

33:07.620 --> 33:13.320
No, I'd like to... stay.

33:13.355 --> 33:17.020
How long...
What about your job?

33:17.055 --> 33:19.390
I can't work at a place
that doesn't respect me.

33:19.540 --> 33:20.640
You could try.

33:20.690 --> 33:24.130
My boss came on to me, and
when I told him no, he fired me.

33:24.165 --> 33:25.230
Well, you
should sue him, then.

33:25.265 --> 33:28.600
And we had an affair
in between and I broke up his

33:28.635 --> 33:30.790
marriage and then I thought
that was a mistake.

33:30.825 --> 33:32.820
I'm not in love with this guy.

33:32.855 --> 33:41.500
So... I need some time
to clear my head.

33:41.535 --> 33:43.400
Mol.

33:43.435 --> 33:46.700
Please?

33:46.735 --> 33:49.640
You always
end up on your feet.

33:49.675 --> 33:53.080
And I end up on my ass.

33:53.115 --> 33:58.710
You can afford to pick me
up, every once in a while.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.250
I always pick you up.

34:02.285 --> 34:05.590
I got to get back to work.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.670
Namir.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.440
Any change?

34:22.475 --> 34:23.710
No.

34:23.745 --> 34:27.280
Which Dr. Mansour
says is a good thing.

34:27.380 --> 34:30.650
Would you mind if I, uh...
if I spent a few minutes

34:30.685 --> 34:31.650
with your father?

34:31.685 --> 34:34.719
There's something I
want to say to him.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.040
Sure, please.

34:41.074 --> 34:42.239
Thank you.

34:42.275 --> 34:44.310
Hey, Amriki.

34:48.250 --> 34:56.260
I, um... I've lived my whole
life hating your family.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.220
I understand.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.030
More than you know.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.260
Hmm.

35:01.295 --> 35:05.160
I still believe that the time
for your family's rule, it is

35:05.170 --> 35:06.400
coming to an end.

35:06.435 --> 35:16.410
But... I am grateful to you for
bringing my father back to me.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.150
Please.

35:51.780 --> 35:55.380
I don't know
if you can hear me.

35:55.415 --> 35:59.280
There's something I
need to tell you.

35:59.290 --> 36:03.320
It wasn't my father who ordered
the gas attack on Ma'an.

36:07.290 --> 36:12.230
Who betrayed you and
sabotaged the peace process.

36:20.340 --> 36:23.140
It was my uncle.

36:26.715 --> 36:31.320
Probably makes no
difference to you, you...

36:31.620 --> 36:33.990
you probably think that one
Al Fayeed is pretty much

36:34.025 --> 36:37.490
interchangeable
with another, but, um..

36:37.525 --> 36:41.560
but to me
it makes all the difference.

36:45.500 --> 36:50.070
Because it means... that
my father meant what he

36:50.105 --> 36:52.740
said to you 20 years ago.

36:52.775 --> 36:55.940
He wanted to make peace.

36:55.975 --> 37:00.950
I have a chance... to
finish what he started.

37:00.985 --> 37:04.450
To do what you and I talked
about when we walked in your garden

37:04.485 --> 37:07.090
that night.

37:07.125 --> 37:11.590
But I know you're the only one in
the way of making that happen.

37:28.340 --> 37:32.610
I know I have no right
to take what I'm taking.

37:37.520 --> 37:42.590
And I have racked my brain trying
to think of any other way.

37:48.360 --> 37:54.870
But the worst thing about evil...
is that it forces you to become

37:54.905 --> 37:56.800
evil in return.

38:31.770 --> 38:34.740
It won't happen right away.

38:34.775 --> 38:38.740
It may take a few hours.

38:38.750 --> 38:42.580
But you won't feel any pain.

38:42.615 --> 38:48.420
If you can hear me... I
hope you can forgive me.

38:48.455 --> 38:51.920
Or at least understand
why I'm doing this.

38:53.625 --> 38:59.600
I want you to know that
you're dying as you lived...

38:59.635 --> 39:03.440
for the people of Ma'an.

39:38.990 --> 39:39.990
Hello?

39:40.025 --> 39:42.060
Jamal.

39:42.095 --> 39:43.790
It's me.

39:43.825 --> 39:46.060
Yeah.

39:46.095 --> 39:53.470
That, um... situation
that you wanted me to handle...

39:53.505 --> 39:55.900
it's done.

39:55.910 --> 39:59.070
What do you mean, "done"?

39:59.080 --> 40:04.810
I mean the man that you
were worried about... he's gone.

40:04.820 --> 40:07.950
Or will be in the
next few hours.

40:07.985 --> 40:12.850
You... You
did it, Bassam?

40:12.860 --> 40:15.660
Yes.

40:20.630 --> 40:24.470
For me?

40:27.035 --> 40:29.100
Yes.

40:31.980 --> 40:33.980
Oh, Bassam.

40:34.015 --> 40:39.880
I... I thought
you'd leave again.

40:39.915 --> 40:47.190
- I know I said that, but, um...
- You love me.

40:54.030 --> 40:57.530
We're brothers.

40:57.565 --> 41:00.970
Are... Are you at the Palace?

41:01.920 --> 41:03.620
No. Why?

41:03.655 --> 41:06.020
Because when this
happens, you're gonna need to

41:06.030 --> 41:07.830
make a statement.

41:07.865 --> 41:08.830
About how much you admired him.

41:08.865 --> 41:11.630
And about how much
he will be missed.

41:11.665 --> 41:12.960
Yeah.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.700
Of course.

41:14.735 --> 41:18.440
I'll be there soon.

41:18.475 --> 41:21.510
Listen, Bassam...

41:25.010 --> 41:28.450
I love you.

41:28.485 --> 41:30.910
Thank you.

42:06.850 --> 42:08.690
Was that the pilot?

42:08.725 --> 42:10.990
They getting the plane ready?

42:11.025 --> 42:16.760
No one's ever left anyone for me
before, much less a whole country.

42:21.405 --> 42:26.070
I was just dreaming that
we were in the Maldives.

42:26.105 --> 42:27.700
I swear, it was so real.

42:27.710 --> 42:34.110
I could... hear the waves and...
feel the sand on my feet.

42:34.145 --> 42:37.920
It was the most beautiful
place I've ever been.

44:02.405 --> 44:04.640
- One more.
- Right away.

44:04.675 --> 44:05.670
You know what, forget it.

44:05.705 --> 44:08.570
Just...
Just bring me the bottle.

44:30.930 --> 44:32.400
Hey.

44:32.435 --> 44:35.100
Um... Sorry I didn't call you back.

44:35.135 --> 44:37.800
I've been... uh, dealing
with some things.

44:37.835 --> 44:39.000
I know.

44:39.035 --> 44:42.710
So, guess who rolled into town
on her train of disaster.

44:42.745 --> 44:44.780
Molly, let's... let's
talk about it later, okay?

44:44.815 --> 44:46.580
Yeah.

44:46.615 --> 44:48.810
Barry...

44:52.090 --> 44:55.090
He's coding!

44:55.125 --> 44:56.790
Load an amp of epi.

44:56.825 --> 44:58.860
Come on!

45:02.800 --> 45:04.360
Keep trying.

45:08.605 --> 45:09.800
Ok. I got this.

45:09.835 --> 45:12.270
I'll take over. I'll take over.

45:31.295 --> 45:32.890
- Hello?
- Tucker.

45:32.925 --> 45:35.890
Listen, I need you to
meet me in the Plaza.

45:35.900 --> 45:39.060
It's 4:00 in the morning.

45:39.095 --> 45:43.130
Yesterday at the
signing you said there were

45:43.165 --> 45:45.800
people who didn't think my
brother was up to the job.

45:45.810 --> 45:47.840
I need their names.

45:47.875 --> 45:49.910
Why?

45:51.840 --> 45:56.450
Barry, what's going on?

45:56.485 --> 46:00.250
Jamal can't
run this country.

46:00.285 --> 46:02.350
I know that now.
