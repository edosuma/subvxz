<b>Huh?</b>

02:26.870 --> 02:28.520
<b>Y-Yes...</b>

02:28.520 --> 02:32.220
<b>He's been at it for a week, non-stop.</b>

02:32.220 --> 02:36.700
<b>You promised he could take the Hunter Exam

02:36.700 --> 02:37.510
<b>What a fool!</b>

02:37.900 --> 02:40.980
<b>Five adults couldn't manage to 
reel in that monster.</b>

02:40.980 --> 02:43.550
<b>How is a child supposed to catch that beast?</b>

02:43.550 --> 02:47.230
<b>Mito-san doesn't want him

02:47.230 --> 02:51.790
<b>But Gon's old man was the same age

02:52.650 --> 02:53.880
<b>He can't do it.</b>

03:15.100 --> 03:17.170
<b>Got him!</b>

03:17.170 --> 03:18.140
<b>Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!</b>

03:18.140 --> 03:20.170
<b>I got him good!</b>

03:56.570 --> 03:58.690
<b>It's huge!</b>

03:58.690 --> 04:00.580
<b>This is the Lord of the Lake?</b>

04:00.580 --> 04:02.070
<b>It's been twenty years!</b>

04:02.070 --> 04:05.360
<b>I know! It was Gon's father that time, right?</b>

04:05.360 --> 04:07.050
<b>He's his father's son.</b>

04:07.690 --> 04:10.940
<b>Gon actually caught the Lord!</b>

04:10.940 --> 04:12.060
<b>Look, Mito-san!</b>

04:17.230 --> 04:18.630
<b>Mito-san!</b>

04:18.630 --> 04:21.200
<b>I caught the Lord, as promised...</b>

04:21.580 --> 04:24.240
<b>So I can take the Hunter Exam, right?</b>

04:24.780 --> 04:25.700
<b>Right?</b>

04:34.210 --> 04:35.700
<b>I'll do my best.</b>

04:35.700 --> 04:37.710
<b>I promise to become a Hunter!</b>

04:47.140 --> 04:49.790
<b>It must be in the blood...</b>

04:49.790 --> 04:52.780
<b>No one has been able to catch the Lord</b>

<b>after Ging pulled it off, at the age of twelve.</b>

04:56.000 --> 05:00.980
<b>And now his son has accomplished

<b>We can no longer stop him.</b>

05:18.080 --> 05:19.700
<b>Are you sure about this, Gon?</b>

05:19.700 --> 05:20.720
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

05:22.100 --> 05:25.950
<b>Your father abandoned you 
when you were still young</b>

05:25.950 --> 05:27.730
<b>to become a Hunter.</b>

05:28.670 --> 05:29.950
<b>I know.</b>

05:29.950 --> 05:32.590
<b>He chose becoming a Hunter over raising you!</b>

05:33.450 --> 05:34.940
<b>Isn't that amazing?</b>

05:34.940 --> 05:35.740
<b>Huh?</b>

05:36.400 --> 05:39.480
<b>Being a Hunter is so great, he was willing</b>

05:39.510 --> 05:40.880
<b>to abandon his own kid!</b>

05:41.670 --> 05:43.850
<b>It's a dangerous job!</b>

05:43.850 --> 05:46.880
<b>You never know when you might lose your life!</b>

05:47.240 --> 05:48.370
<b>Don't you understand?</b>

05:50.320 --> 05:51.860
<b>I don't.</b>

05:51.860 --> 05:53.390
<b>But I want to know more!</b>

05:54.080 --> 05:56.390
<b>I want to become a Hunter and discover why</b>

05:56.390 --> 05:58.550
<b>it was so important to my dad!</b>

06:07.990 --> 06:11.050
<b>You really are Ging's son...</b>

06:22.050 --> 06:24.460
<b>I promise I'll pass the exam.</b>

06:24.460 --> 06:27.520
<b>I'll pass the exam, and I'll become a Hunter!</b>

06:28.680 --> 06:31.520
<b>Just promise that you'll come back safe.</b>

06:32.240 --> 06:33.530
<b>Can you do that?</b>

06:34.050 --> 06:36.070
<b>Uh-huh, I promise!</b>

06:38.550 --> 06:40.540
<b>Pinky swear made...</b>

06:40.740 --> 06:45.520
<b>Whoever breaks their promise has

06:46.300 --> 06:56.940
<b>Sealed with a kiss!</b>

07:03.160 --> 07:04.040
<b>Gon...</b>

07:06.020 --> 07:08.780
<b>Thank you, Mito-san.</b>

07:29.060 --> 07:31.320
<b>Good luck!</b>

07:33.780 --> 07:35.740
<b>Knock 'em dead!</b>

<b>I'm going to become the

<b>Once I'm the best Hunter

<b>The best Hunter in the world?</b>

08:02.350 --> 08:04.580
<b>Kid doesn't respect us.</b>

<b>Every year, there are millions of skilled

<b>Don't say stuff that you can't back up, boy.</b>

08:28.360 --> 08:29.610
<b>What are you doing, Katsuo?</b>

08:29.980 --> 08:33.620
<b>At this rate, you'll never make a decent sailor.</b>

<b>Why are you bent over?</b>

08:42.310 --> 08:43.890
<b>Hey, losers!</b>

08:44.920 --> 08:46.510
<b>Don't slack off!</b>

08:46.510 --> 08:47.900
<b>A-Aye, sir!</b>

08:50.200 --> 08:50.900
<b>Hey...</b>

08:51.720 --> 08:53.330
<b>Didn't you hear me?</b>

08:53.330 --> 08:54.540
<b>Move that box!</b>

08:54.540 --> 08:55.920
<b>A-Aye, Captain!</b>

08:55.920 --> 08:57.140
<b>Hold on.</b>

09:01.120 --> 09:02.540
<b>Thanks!</b>

09:11.050 --> 09:12.550
<b>A storm's coming.</b>

09:13.820 --> 09:15.940
<b>How can you tell, boy?</b>

09:15.940 --> 09:18.120
<b>That's what the seagulls are saying.</b>

09:18.120 --> 09:19.230
<b>What?</b>

09:19.230 --> 09:20.160
<b>Plus...</b>

09:35.420 --> 09:37.680
<b>It's a huge storm that's coming!</b>

09:38.690 --> 09:39.680
<b>It's true...</b>

09:40.190 --> 09:42.190
<b>I can tell by the smell!</b>

09:43.420 --> 09:45.190
<b><i>That boy...</i></b>

09:50.580 --> 09:52.010
<b><i>Those eyes...</i></b>

09:52.670 --> 09:54.200
<b><i>Could he be...</i></b>

10:12.480 --> 10:13.480
<b>Captain!</b>

10:13.780 --> 10:16.040
<b>The mast won't last much longer!</b>

10:16.040 --> 10:17.540
<b>We should lower the sails!</b>

10:17.540 --> 10:19.010
<b>Don't be stupid!</b>

10:19.510 --> 10:22.520
<b>The fun's about to start.</b>

10:27.550 --> 10:28.730
<b>Here we go!</b>

10:31.000 --> 10:33.500
<b>Full to port!</b>

10:37.610 --> 10:40.670
<b>Let's fly!</b>

10:45.920 --> 10:55.990
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

10:51.800 --> 10:55.990
<b>Gon</b>

11:04.080 --> 11:07.140
<b>Those waves weren't much...</b>

11:07.140 --> 11:09.260
<b>Hey, take the helm.</b>

11:09.260 --> 11:10.570
<b>A-Aye!</b>

11:13.300 --> 11:17.250
<b>Damn, this is one lousy crew.</b>

11:20.530 --> 11:22.420
<b>Not a one of them can stand.</b>

11:22.420 --> 11:24.220
<b>Pathetic.</b>

11:24.220 --> 11:27.160
<b>And they're supposed to be 
taking the Hunter Examination.</b>

11:27.160 --> 11:29.560
<b>What a laugh!</b>

11:29.560 --> 11:31.390
<b>Here are some herbs.</b>

11:32.100 --> 11:34.320
<b>If you chew them, you'll feel a little better.</b>

11:35.390 --> 11:36.670
<b>W-Water...</b>

11:37.030 --> 11:38.900
<b>It's coming, so hold on.</b>

11:39.520 --> 11:41.400
<b>That boy...</b>

11:54.200 --> 11:56.420
<b>This is one sour apple...</b>

11:57.040 --> 11:58.590
<b><i>I see.</i></b>

11:58.590 --> 12:02.190
<b><i>There are a few tough nuts on board.</i></b>

12:02.190 --> 12:03.110
<b>Excuse me!</b>

12:03.810 --> 12:05.330
<b>H-Here is your water!</b>

12:05.760 --> 12:06.930
<b>Thanks.</b>

12:07.790 --> 12:09.310
<b>Now drink your fill.</b>

12:22.980 --> 12:25.790
<b>Thanks. I really appreciate it, Katsuo-san.</b>

12:30.700 --> 12:33.720
<b>First, tell me your names.</b>

12:34.020 --> 12:35.410
<b>I'm Gon!</b>

12:35.410 --> 12:37.270
<b>I'm Kurapika.</b>

12:37.270 --> 12:38.830
<b>It's Leorio.</b>

12:38.860 --> 12:42.420
<b>Why do you want to become Hunters?</b>

12:42.420 --> 12:46.080
<b>Hey! If you're not an examiner, 
you can't boss us around!</b>

12:46.510 --> 12:48.600
<b>Just answer the question!</b>

12:49.320 --> 12:51.610
<b>My dad is a Hunter.</b>

12:53.570 --> 12:57.110
<b>I left Whale Island because I want to know</b>

12:57.430 --> 13:00.480
<b>why my dad desired so much to be a Hunter.</b>

13:01.750 --> 13:03.330
<b><i>Whale Island...</i></b>

13:03.330 --> 13:06.140
<b><i>So this is Ging's son.</i></b>

13:07.290 --> 13:09.930
<b><i>The day has finally come.</i></b>

13:10.510 --> 13:12.140
<b>Hey, kid!</b>

13:12.140 --> 13:12.860
<b>Huh?</b>

13:12.900 --> 13:15.560
<b>You're not supposed to answer his question!</b>

13:15.560 --> 13:17.930
<b>Why can't I tell him why I'm here?</b>

13:17.930 --> 13:20.310
<b>Not a team player, huh?</b>

13:20.310 --> 13:22.360
<b>I don't wish to reveal why I'm here.</b>

13:22.360 --> 13:24.770
<b>I agree with Leorio.</b>

13:24.770 --> 13:25.640
<b>What?</b>

13:25.640 --> 13:28.200
<b>Hey! Aren't you younger than I am?</b>

13:28.200 --> 13:30.110
<b>Show some respect!</b>

13:30.110 --> 13:32.550
<b>It's quite simple to avoid pesky questions</b>

13:32.550 --> 13:35.100
<b>by offering a plausible lie.</b>

13:35.100 --> 13:37.020
<b>Hey! Are you listening to me?</b>

13:37.050 --> 13:40.720
<b>However, it is quite shameful to rely upon deceit.</b>

13:40.720 --> 13:43.990
<b>That said, if I were to tell you the truth,</b>

13:43.990 --> 13:49.300
<b>I would be exposing my deepest secrets.</b>

13:49.300 --> 13:52.230
<b>That is why I cannot provide an answer.</b>

13:52.230 --> 13:54.440
<b>Hey, you... Don't ignore me!</b>

13:54.440 --> 13:58.420
<b>In other words, 
you refuse to answer my question.</b>

13:59.290 --> 14:00.720
<b>Hey, Katsuo.</b>

14:00.720 --> 14:01.810
<b>Aye, Captain.</b>

14:02.300 --> 14:06.820
<b>Tell the examination board that 
we have two more dropouts.</b>

14:08.470 --> 14:09.820
<b>What do you mean?</b>

14:09.820 --> 14:12.050
<b>You still haven't figured it out?</b>

14:12.580 --> 14:15.320
<b>The Hunter Examination has already begun.</b>

14:15.320 --> 14:16.540
<b>What?</b>

14:21.860 --> 14:24.510
<b>There are as many Hunter wannabes</b>

14:24.510 --> 14:26.900
<b>as there are stars in the sky.</b>

14:26.900 --> 14:32.710
<b>The examiners don't have the time or 
resources to review them all.</b>

14:33.130 --> 14:38.720
<b>So they hire people like us, to trim the fat.</b>

14:39.520 --> 14:41.560
<b>I've already notified the board</b>

14:41.560 --> 14:45.090
<b>that everyone else on this ship had to withdraw.</b>

14:46.230 --> 14:48.620
<b>If they couldn't handle a little storm,</b>

14:48.620 --> 14:52.360
<b>they'd stand no chance in the 
Hunter Examination's later stages.</b>

14:52.710 --> 14:59.430
<b>In other words, you only proceed to 
the main exam if I pass you.</b>

15:00.710 --> 15:04.730
<b>So think carefully before you answer my question.</b>

15:05.810 --> 15:07.220
<b>So he says...</b>

15:09.800 --> 15:12.120
<b>Should have told us sooner.</b>

15:14.070 --> 15:16.890
<b>I am the last survivor of the Kurta Clan.</b>

15:19.450 --> 15:24.260
<b>Four years ago, my clan was annihilated 
by a band of criminals.</b>

15:25.010 --> 15:27.370
<b>I wish to become a Hunter and 
hunt down that band,</b>

15:27.370 --> 15:28.900
<b>the Phantom Troupe.</b>

15:30.000 --> 15:32.880
<b>So you want to become a bounty hunter?</b>

15:33.640 --> 15:36.410
<b>The Phantom Troupe is a Class-A bounty.</b>

15:37.340 --> 15:40.640
<b>Not even the most grizzled Hunters 
can touch them.</b>

15:41.060 --> 15:43.480
<b>You'd be throwing away your life.</b>

15:44.610 --> 15:46.760
<b>I do not fear death.</b>

15:47.710 --> 15:50.790
<b>I fear only that my rage</b>

15:51.360 --> 15:54.200
<b>will fade over time.</b>

15:56.390 --> 15:58.810
<b>So, in other words, you want revenge.</b>

15:58.810 --> 16:02.800
<b>Does that require that you become a Hunter?</b>

16:03.120 --> 16:07.020
<b>That may be the stupidest question 
I've ever heard, Leorio.</b>

16:07.020 --> 16:08.540
<b>That's Leorio-san to you!</b>

16:08.840 --> 16:11.540
<b>Places accessible only to Hunters...</b>

16:11.540 --> 16:13.010
<b>Information otherwise unobtainable...</b>

16:13.350 --> 16:14.670
<b>Actions otherwise impossible...</b>

16:15.160 --> 16:19.200
<b>There are more reasons than your 
brain could possibly handle.</b>

16:20.170 --> 16:21.050
<b>Hey!</b>

16:22.130 --> 16:25.150
<b>Why do you want to become a Hunter, Leorio-san?</b>

16:25.950 --> 16:27.000
<b>Me?</b>

16:27.530 --> 16:29.280
<b>I'll make it short.</b>

16:30.270 --> 16:31.420
<b>I want money.</b>

16:32.330 --> 16:35.830
<b>Money can get you everything!</b>

16:36.260 --> 16:37.330
<b>A big house!</b>

16:37.650 --> 16:38.840
<b>A nice car!</b>

16:39.610 --> 16:41.340
<b>Good liquor!</b>

16:42.820 --> 16:46.420
<b>You can't buy class with money, Leorio.</b>

16:51.330 --> 16:52.980
<b>That's three times now.</b>

16:53.960 --> 16:55.210
<b>Step outside.</b>

16:55.950 --> 16:59.330
<b>I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline, here and now.</b>

16:59.930 --> 17:01.420
<b>Take that back, Leorio!</b>

17:05.910 --> 17:07.390
<b>Take that back!</b>

17:10.590 --> 17:12.010
<b>That's Leorio-san to you.</b>

17:15.510 --> 17:17.590
<b>Hey, boys!</b>

17:17.590 --> 17:19.820
<b>I'm not finished yet!</b>

17:19.820 --> 17:20.930
<b>Just let them go.</b>

17:20.930 --> 17:21.510
<b>Huh?</b>

17:22.810 --> 17:25.850
<b>Mito-san once told me...</b>

17:27.350 --> 17:29.740
<b><i>If you want to get to know someone,</i></b>

17:29.740 --> 17:31.750
<b><i>you need to make an effort</i></b>

17:32.020 --> 17:34.060
<b><i>to learn why they're angry.</i></b>

17:35.920 --> 17:39.900
<b>It's important for them to 
understand why they're mad.</b>

17:40.280 --> 17:43.390
<b>So we should let them settle it themselves.</b>

17:46.870 --> 17:48.220
<b>Captain!</b>

17:48.920 --> 17:51.270
<b>L-Look...</b>

17:56.860 --> 18:00.670
<b>If we get caught by that waterspout, 
the ship will sink.</b>

18:00.670 --> 18:02.420
<b>Lower the sails now.</b>

18:02.420 --> 18:03.070
<b>Aye!</b>

18:03.070 --> 18:04.430
<b>I'll help!</b>

18:04.430 --> 18:06.170
<b>Uh-huh, come with me.</b>

18:06.170 --> 18:07.990
<b>I'll take the helm.</b>

18:07.990 --> 18:08.660
<b>Aye!</b>

18:09.140 --> 18:11.160
<b>Full to starboard!</b>

18:13.390 --> 18:14.230
<b>Hurry!</b>

18:14.760 --> 18:18.190
<b>The waterspout is gonna catch us!</b>

18:38.220 --> 18:40.620
<b>Take back what you said!</b>

18:40.990 --> 18:43.690
<b>Take back your words, 
and I'll forgive you, Leorio.</b>

18:44.120 --> 18:46.210
<b>How many times must I repeat myself?</b>

18:46.210 --> 18:47.940
<b>You should show me some respect.</b>

18:47.940 --> 18:50.330
<b>I won't back down.</b>

18:51.750 --> 18:53.050
<b>Then I have no choice...</b>

19:07.980 --> 19:09.320
<b>Katsuo-san!</b>

19:16.990 --> 19:18.230
<b>Damn it!</b>

19:32.020 --> 19:33.810
<b>Pull 'em out! Now...</b>

19:49.520 --> 19:51.140
<b>You idiot!</b>

19:51.140 --> 19:53.980
<b>If we hadn't grabbed your legs,</b>

19:53.980 --> 19:56.670
<b>you'd be shark bait now.</b>

19:56.670 --> 19:58.120
<b>Honestly...</b>

19:58.120 --> 20:00.030
<b>How reckless can you be?</b>

20:00.030 --> 20:02.180
<b>But you did catch me.</b>

20:02.180 --> 20:03.070
<b>Huh?</b>

20:04.010 --> 20:06.910
<b>You both caught me!</b>

20:07.620 --> 20:09.750
<b>Well, I guess so...</b>

20:10.410 --> 20:11.200
<b>Gon!</b>

20:14.990 --> 20:16.230
<b>Katsuo-san!</b>

20:16.690 --> 20:18.660
<b>Thanks, Gon!</b>

20:18.660 --> 20:20.440
<b>You saved my life.</b>

20:21.360 --> 20:23.610
<b>I couldn't have done it alone.</b>

20:23.610 --> 20:25.930
<b>These two helped save you.</b>

20:25.960 --> 20:26.830
<b>Huh?</b>

20:27.520 --> 20:29.200
<b>Thank you very much!</b>

20:30.860 --> 20:33.070
<b>No, you don't need to thank me.</b>

20:33.980 --> 20:35.140
<b>Well...</b>

20:35.140 --> 20:38.070
<b>Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.</b>

20:38.070 --> 20:42.370
<b>Yeah! So I'll be returning to my station!</b>

20:46.430 --> 20:48.080
<b>What?</b>

20:48.610 --> 20:51.060
<b>I apologize for my rude behavior.</b>

20:51.060 --> 20:54.090
<b>Sorry, Leorio-san.</b>

20:54.490 --> 20:57.130
<b>Wh-What's with the sudden change?</b>

20:57.130 --> 20:58.620
<b>We sound like strangers...</b>

20:58.620 --> 21:01.100
<b>Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.</b>

21:02.980 --> 21:04.500
<b>I'm also sorry.</b>

21:05.780 --> 21:08.420
<b>I take back everything I said.</b>

21:09.150 --> 21:10.340
<b>I was wrong.</b>

21:10.700 --> 21:12.430
<b>No, it's okay.</b>

21:18.150 --> 21:20.250
<b>I like you guys!</b>

21:20.670 --> 21:21.750
<b>Okay!</b>

21:22.200 --> 21:24.630
<b>I'll take responsibility for bringing</b>

21:24.630 --> 21:28.550
<b>you three to the port closest to the exam site.</b>

21:29.320 --> 21:30.490
<b>Really?</b>

21:30.930 --> 21:32.780
<b>What about your test?</b>

21:34.560 --> 21:35.890
<b>Like I said...</b>

21:35.890 --> 21:38.320
<b>It's my decision to make.</b>

21:39.930 --> 21:42.010
<b>And all three of you pass!</b>

21:45.860 --> 21:48.620
<b>Yay!</b>

21:51.490 --> 21:54.590
<b>And so began Gon's journey...</b>

21:55.050 --> 21:59.190
<b>To follow in his father's footsteps 
and become a Hunter.</b>

23:30.090 --> 23:32.620
<b>Next time: Test x Of x Tests.</b>

23:32.620 --> 23:33.720
<b>Look forward to it!</b>
