00:03.440 --> 00:04.260
Hello.

00:05.260 --> 00:07.700
He's on a bus with William.
-Who's William?

00:07.700 --> 00:13.460
He's the most handsome and coolest
guy in all of third year.

00:14.060 --> 00:15.860
Invite me to have
dinner with your mom.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.120
Friday.
-Yeah... Friday.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.140
Guess who's invited
to the Penetrator party on Friday?

00:21.340 --> 00:23.340
Are you for real, Eva?!

00:23.460 --> 00:27.340
William asked me if I wanted to
go outside with him. I think we'll hook up.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.360
Hi! Is Jonas home?
-Yeah, he's in the living room.

01:08.940 --> 01:10.700
Hello.
-Hi.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.340
What are you guys playing?
-FIFA.

01:28.140 --> 01:29.260
What's up?

01:30.080 --> 01:30.980
What?

01:33.200 --> 01:35.560
Where's your Russ crew today?

01:36.420 --> 01:38.680
Don't you have a shitload to do?

01:38.840 --> 01:44.100
It's only two years and seven
months until Russ time. You better start working.

01:47.600 --> 01:54.200
I know. I'm really jealous of you guys, who
spend their time on more constructive things...

01:54.240 --> 01:56.980
Like playing videogames all day long.

01:56.980 --> 01:58.980
What are you mad about now?

01:58.980 --> 02:02.380
I'm not mad. I'm just
kidding. Have a little humor.

02:08.460 --> 02:09.840
I have to talk to you.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.700
Drama!

02:17.680 --> 02:19.800
What's wrong?

02:22.000 --> 02:25.320
What's wrong with you?
-There's nothing wrong with me.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.760
Okay...

02:29.400 --> 02:31.060
So why haven't
you replied to my messages?

02:32.740 --> 02:33.880
I was busy.

02:38.660 --> 02:42.020
So you're not mad I forgot our thing yesterday?
-No, no.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.640
I don't care.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.260
You don't care?

02:46.520 --> 02:48.160
Don't stress about it.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.800
Okay, good.
-Good.

02:52.880 --> 02:53.720
Fine.

03:00.420 --> 03:04.280
Yeah, so I'll go.
-You're welcome to stay.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.340
No, I have a lot of stuff to do.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.940
Yeah, I'll call you.

03:33.620 --> 03:39.520
He claims he's not pissed, but I think
there's something when he doesn't want to talk about it.

03:39.900 --> 03:43.960
But isn't he just pissed because he thought
that you didn't want him to meet your mom?

03:44.080 --> 03:46.280
He thinks you're embarrassed of him.

03:47.540 --> 03:48.520
You think so?

03:48.740 --> 03:51.820
Just let him meet
your mom. What's the problem?

03:53.600 --> 03:58.560
Chris has to tell Sana
that she can't be on our bus any longer.

03:58.980 --> 03:59.860
Why?

03:59.860 --> 04:04.840
Hello?! She nearly ruined our
entire social status, and I had to fix it.

04:04.840 --> 04:09.900
I had to explain to the Penetrator
guys that we don't usually create a lot of drama.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.800
It's really important what they think of us.

04:11.900 --> 04:18.160
But maybe it wasn't Sana's fault?
-Have you met Sana? She's incredibly rude.

04:18.700 --> 04:21.600
Sara and Ingrid aren't
the nicest people in the world.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.700
I know Sara and Ingrid really well
and they're not girls who start drama.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.820
Really...

04:30.720 --> 04:31.640
William...

04:31.720 --> 04:35.280
What's up with you two?
-I think we'll sleep together.

04:38.460 --> 04:39.540
Okay?

04:39.600 --> 04:44.420
Don't you think you should
get to know him a little better first?

04:44.420 --> 04:46.360
Why? He's totally perfect.

04:46.960 --> 04:55.420
I want my first time to be with the most handsome,
coolest '97 guy rather than someone basic.

04:55.940 --> 04:59.120
You'll remember your first time for the rest of your life.
-His first time?

04:59.200 --> 05:03.560
I've also heard that
William is really, really good in bed.

05:03.560 --> 05:08.120
And that usually you don't get
an orgasm the first time. But with William, you do.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.660
I've heard about
five girls who got an orgasm.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.580
Okay...

05:13.300 --> 05:18.440
Hello?! I'm doing this for you guys too!
This will guarantee we'll get to party on their bus.

05:19.380 --> 05:20.580
Vilde?!

05:25.040 --> 05:26.920
There's something I was wondering.

05:28.140 --> 05:31.980
Can I borrow the pill from you guys?
You can't borrow the pill.

05:31.980 --> 05:36.740
Not one pill. I thought for
a week or something. You have it?

05:36.880 --> 05:37.880
I don't have it.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.600
Me neither.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.400
Don't you sleep with your boyfriend?

05:41.600 --> 05:45.180
I have a NuvaRing. And you
don't want to borrow that one.

05:45.380 --> 05:47.100
Where did you get it?

05:47.620 --> 05:48.760
The doctor.

05:49.220 --> 05:53.480
So much stress. Can't
you order it online or something?

05:53.840 --> 05:57.000
I don't know.
-Just go to the school doctor.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.460
Can you come with me?
-Why?

06:00.460 --> 06:06.060
Because it's really weird to go there alone.
-It's so much less weird with us...

06:06.660 --> 06:08.140
Of course we can come, Vilde.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.360
William!

06:30.200 --> 06:34.040
Hey, are you awake?
-Yeah, I can't sleep.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.720
What are you doing?
-It's just boring work.

06:53.060 --> 06:56.100
No wonder your grades
are going down if you don't sleep at night.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.800
I definitely won't sleep
if we're going to talk about grades.

07:12.080 --> 07:16.820
How are Ingrid and Sara doing?
-Why are you asking and interrogating like that?

07:16.820 --> 07:19.680
It was just a normal question.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.700
Yeah. Yeah, they're doing well.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.860
I have a boyfriend.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.400
Oh?

07:41.120 --> 07:42.220
Hm-hm.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.100
Who is it?

07:48.580 --> 07:49.960
Who?
-Hm-hm.

07:51.820 --> 07:53.780
I thought you could meet him.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.220
Yes!

07:59.180 --> 08:02.360
Before you leave again?
-Hm-hm.

08:03.460 --> 08:07.100
Maybe we can invite
him over for dinner?

08:07.660 --> 08:08.460
Yes.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.780
When are you leaving again?
-Saturday morning.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.860
Maybe Friday night?

08:25.060 --> 08:26.300
So nice.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.340
Hi.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.640
Have you become friends again, or?

09:18.560 --> 09:21.200
This is Noora. I've told you about Noora.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.980
Noora.
-Hello. Jonas.

09:24.820 --> 09:28.840
We have an appointment at the school doctor.
-Yeah, what about Vilde?

09:29.020 --> 09:30.480
Vilde will meet us there.

09:31.540 --> 09:33.820
What's going on at the doctor?

09:33.820 --> 09:36.140
We're helping a friend get laid.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.180
Okay... Good luck with that.
-Thanks!

10:12.460 --> 10:14.320
You guys are so slow!

10:14.700 --> 10:18.440
Sorry!
-But, are you doing anything on Friday?

10:19.340 --> 10:21.600
What is she doing here?

10:21.600 --> 10:22.980
How did you know we were here?

10:23.020 --> 10:24.520
Eva's boyfriend told me.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.560
Did you tell your boyfriend?!
-I have the best news in the world!

10:28.560 --> 10:31.680
Sana sold all the toilet paper!
-Vilde Lien?

10:31.920 --> 10:34.060
I'm serious!
-How did she manage that?

10:34.060 --> 10:39.440
I don't know! She said you
just had to send your account number and address.

10:39.480 --> 10:40.360
Are you kidding?
-No!

10:40.400 --> 10:43.060
Can she please join our bus?
-It's not something illegal?

10:43.080 --> 10:44.980
No, no! She's Muslim.

10:46.140 --> 10:53.040
No, but as a Muslim you go to hell if you do
something illegal. She doesn't really want to go to hell.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.380
Welcome!

10:54.580 --> 10:55.740
Everyone.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.280
What can I help you with?
-She's gonna sleep with a guy.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.460
You're so lucky!

11:03.620 --> 11:04.880
For the first time.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.340
That's not just anything.

11:09.940 --> 11:11.040
What do you mean?

11:11.040 --> 11:15.000
My cousin bled so
much that she got anemia.

11:15.140 --> 11:20.300
That's bullshit.
-No, bleeding can happen during your first intercourse.

11:20.580 --> 11:26.000
Large bleedings should be taken
seriously because they can in fact kill you.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.760
She just got a little weak.
-Then she was lucky.

11:31.780 --> 11:37.480
I had a patient once who bled so extremely
that we feared she would pass out.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.040
Because she had sex for the first time?

11:40.040 --> 11:49.260
No, she cut herself. She bled so much
that we had to give her a blood transfusion.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.260
But she just wants to have the pill.

11:54.260 --> 11:56.940
Yes. When will the intercourse take place?

11:57.060 --> 11:59.640
On Friday.
-On Friday?!

11:59.640 --> 12:04.900
That's when William's available.
I thought that we could drink in Eva's basement.

12:04.900 --> 12:08.020
We should drink? You're the
one who will be having sex with him.

12:08.180 --> 12:10.820
I can't drink by myself.
You have to support me.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.700
Why do you have to drink at all?

12:12.700 --> 12:16.780
It can't be at my place.
Mom's home and Jonas is coming.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.800
Please-
-Have you seen one like this before?

12:22.660 --> 12:26.720
Do any of you perhaps want
to see how to put on a condom?

12:32.660 --> 12:33.820
It's difficult to open.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.180
It tends to be...

12:42.680 --> 12:43.560
There we go.

13:03.660 --> 13:06.840
Be honest, how painful is it?

13:08.060 --> 13:10.720
I don't remember anything from my first time.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.780
Just drink, you won't feel anything.

13:14.540 --> 13:17.320
Do you want to be
so drunk that you don't remember anything?

13:18.660 --> 13:20.980
Were you drunk your first time?
-No.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.080
Pinch my arm.
How much does it hurt?

13:28.300 --> 13:30.900
Seriously?
-It doesn't resemble pinching.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.320
Just relax,
so it doesn't hurt.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.020
What do you know?
You haven't even had sex.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.620
Okay, seriously.
William has to call soon.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.300
What did he write last?

13:42.300 --> 13:46.160
Pick you up around 7.
We'll find something.

13:46.160 --> 13:49.160
Can't you just call him?

13:49.160 --> 13:51.880
I can't seem too desperate for his dick.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.760
But what if he doesn't send a message?

13:55.160 --> 13:59.700
Then I would be a little bit relieved.
-Vilde, you don't have to have sex with him if you don't want to.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.840
I want to! But I just don't want it to hurt.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.700
No, but that's why
you have to relax.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.500
What turns you on about him?

14:10.640 --> 14:11.720
Turns me on?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.860
What gets you horny?
-Horny...

14:14.040 --> 14:18.060
Nothing makes me horny.
-You're never horny?

14:18.240 --> 14:19.800
Are you?
-Yes!

14:20.460 --> 14:22.620
Why don't you have sex then?

14:23.820 --> 14:26.060
I know what can make you horny.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.420
I won't be
involved in lesbian stuff.

14:29.420 --> 14:34.540
Vilde, it's not lesbian stuff.
Just lie on your back and close your eyes.

14:42.100 --> 14:47.420
Imagine you and William
standing in the bedroom. Are you imagining it?

14:47.580 --> 14:49.260
Yes.
-What's happening?

14:49.260 --> 14:51.600
What's happening?
-Yeah, describe it.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.120
We're standing in the bedroom.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.420
I'm wearing a white dress.
-Yeah, good. Continue.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.480
Okay!

15:01.680 --> 15:07.280
The dress is almost similar to
a Stella McCartney dress with lace at the bottom.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.600
But it doesn't have lace at the bottom.

15:11.880 --> 15:15.200
I have my hair down.
No! I'm wearing it up.

15:15.220 --> 15:18.480
But my up-do is loose
so my hair falls down some.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.820
I'm wearing light pink lipstick.

15:20.940 --> 15:25.380
Not the lightest from Mac,
but the one that's kind of medium.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.160
This actually works!

15:28.840 --> 15:29.800
Seriously?

15:29.800 --> 15:30.780
I think so!

15:30.780 --> 15:33.980
You get horny when
talking about clothes and make-up?

15:34.500 --> 15:35.360
Yes!

15:35.540 --> 15:37.800
People get horny from different things.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.080
I was watching a documentary
about the countryside and got horny from donkeys.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.780
Eva?

15:44.260 --> 15:45.540
I'm coming!

15:45.740 --> 15:47.400
Okay, you guys have to leave now.

15:47.900 --> 15:50.920
We can't go.
He hasn't sent a message yet.

15:50.920 --> 15:54.560
Go to your house, then.
-I can't go home, I've been drinking.

15:54.820 --> 15:58.120
Can't we just
sit here? We can be quiet.

15:58.220 --> 15:59.040
Eva?

15:59.560 --> 16:01.120
Yeah, I'm coming!

16:02.320 --> 16:05.000
Okay, okay!
But you have to be really quiet.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.660
Leave through the window, okay?

16:18.020 --> 16:21.220
Hi!
Hi. Shouldn't your boyfriend be coming now?

16:21.460 --> 16:26.300
Eh, yes! But he sent
a message that he's a bit delayed.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.180
Okay.

16:30.980 --> 16:32.340
<i>[Where the hell are you?]</i>

16:32.340 --> 16:33.180
Do you need help?
<i>[Where the hell are you?]</i>

16:33.180 --> 16:33.980
Do you need help?

16:34.100 --> 16:35.540
No, it's going well.

16:37.140 --> 16:38.420
What was that?

16:40.620 --> 16:44.540
I forgot to turn off a movie.
I'll fix it.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.200
What are you doing here?

16:54.320 --> 16:58.200
Is Vilde here?
-No! Eh, yes. But you can't be here.

16:58.700 --> 17:02.600
Hi! Nice to meet you.
-Hi. William.

17:03.200 --> 17:08.500
No, no, no. This isn't
my boyfiriend. This is Vilde's boyfriend.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.580
Oh, really?
Who's Vilde?

17:11.440 --> 17:16.480
A friend. William thought Vilde
was here, but she isn't. So he's leaving now.

17:18.120 --> 17:23.200
Chris, Noora, Vilde!
What are you doing here?

17:25.680 --> 17:30.200
Remember when I borrowed your jacket?

17:30.200 --> 17:32.760
Well we thought we'd bring it.

17:32.760 --> 17:41.040
But you weren't in your basement, so we
left it in a bag outside... your window.

17:41.260 --> 17:45.400
Yeah, thanks.
But now you surely have to go again.

17:45.720 --> 17:52.320
Yeah, yeah. We have so
many jackets to deliver. So we'll just...

17:52.500 --> 17:55.420
See you!
Come.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.780
Bye!

17:59.460 --> 18:01.220
What's going on here, Eva?

18:01.400 --> 18:03.740
Nothing's going on.
-Were those girls drunk?

18:03.820 --> 18:04.740
No.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.280
Where are you?
-I can't come anymore.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.860
Why not?

18:12.780 --> 18:17.680
Because I forgot I said I'd help my mom with something.
-Can't you help her later?

18:17.880 --> 18:20.800
No it's really important.
I have to do it now.

18:22.220 --> 18:24.240
Who was that?
-That was my sister.

18:25.100 --> 18:29.240
Jonas!
-I'm sorry, but I have to go now.
