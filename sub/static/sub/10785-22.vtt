00:01.375 --> 00:03.500
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY
ON  DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.500 --> 00:04.667
MY DAD CAME BACK
INTO TOWN,

00:04.667 --> 00:06.083
AND HE'S GONNA
MAKE US GO HOME.

00:06.083 --> 00:08.500
HE'S TAKING US BACK
TO PROVIDENCE.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
I LOVE YOU,
AND I'M SO PROUD
OF YOU,

00:11.333 --> 00:12.792
AND I'M PROUD
TO BE WITH YOU.

00:12.792 --> 00:14.959
I'M TAKING YOU BACK
TO MY PLACE.

00:14.959 --> 00:15.917
IT'S PRETTY EMPTY,

00:15.917 --> 00:18.792
AND, UH, I COULD
USE A ROOMMATE.

00:18.792 --> 00:21.625
GO GET BETTER,
McPHEE,

00:21.625 --> 00:24.083
AND THEN YOU HURRY
BACK TO ME, OK?

00:27.542 --> 00:29.291
LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.667
IS IT YOUR IDEA I SHOULD LIVE
WITH YOU AS YOUR MISTRESS?

00:33.667 --> 00:36.250
I WANT...

00:36.250 --> 00:38.542
SOMEHOW I WANT
TO GET AWAY WITH YOU

00:38.542 --> 00:42.041
AND FIND A WORLD
WHERE WORDS LIKE
THAT DON'T EXIST.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.792
OH, MY DEAR.

00:46.166 --> 00:49.208
WHERE IS THAT COUNTRY?
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE?

00:50.875 --> 00:52.375
HEY, THERE. ABRUPT.

00:52.375 --> 00:57.125
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
UNREQUITED LOVE
FOR ONE EVENING, OK?

00:57.125 --> 00:58.667
IT'S TOO TORTUROUS.

01:02.708 --> 01:04.750
I WONDER WHAT SICK PART
IT IS ABOUT ME

01:04.750 --> 01:07.583
THAT THRIVES OFF
OF THESE KINDS
OF LOVE STORIES.

01:07.583 --> 01:09.291
THE KINDS THAT END
UNHAPPILY?

01:09.291 --> 01:12.667
NO, THE KINDS THAT
NEVER REALLY END.

01:12.667 --> 01:14.458
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
TO CONTINUE LOVING SOMEBODY

01:14.458 --> 01:18.333
WHEN THERE'S NO PROMISE
OF THAT LOVE EVER THRIVING,

01:18.333 --> 01:20.375
THAT IS ROMANCE.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.000
THAT IS TRAGEDY.

01:22.000 --> 01:22.959
NOT ALL LOVE STORIES

01:22.959 --> 01:25.417
HAVE A BUILT-IN
HAPPY ENDING, DAWSON.

01:25.417 --> 01:27.834
TRUE, BUT WHY REVEL
IN THE ONES THAT DON'T?

01:30.083 --> 01:32.792
I'M SORRY. SAD STORIES
ARE JUST MORE POWERFUL.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.208
I PREFER THEM.

01:35.959 --> 01:38.625
BUT THEN DO YOU
THINK THAT...

01:41.000 --> 01:42.125
SPEAK.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.291
DON'T YOU THINK THAT
THAT KIND OF PREFERENCE

01:45.291 --> 01:48.375
HAS SOME KIND EFFECT
ON YOUR OWN LOVE STORY?

01:48.375 --> 01:49.542
IT ABSOLUTELY DOES.

01:50.708 --> 01:52.250
AND THAT DOESN'T
WORRY YOU?

01:52.250 --> 01:55.083
NO, BECAUSE THE EFFECT
IS POSITIVE.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.000
I MEAN, IT'S MOVIES
LIKE THESE THAT REMIND ME

01:57.000 --> 01:59.333
OF HOW UNMOVABLE
AND STRONG LOVE CAN BE.

01:59.333 --> 02:00.583
BUT THEY DON'T
END HAPPILY.

02:01.750 --> 02:02.542
I MEAN,
DANIEL DAY-LEWIS

02:02.542 --> 02:04.250
NEVER GETS
MICHELLE PFEIFFER.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.542
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.875
IT'S JUST
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:06.875 --> 02:08.458
BUT WHAT GOOD
IS THEIR LOVE

02:08.458 --> 02:10.959
IF IT'S NOT STRONG
ENOUGH TO OVERCOME
THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

02:10.959 --> 02:13.375
BECAUSE IN SPITE
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES

02:13.375 --> 02:14.917
THEY NEVER STOP LOVING.

02:22.959 --> 02:25.208
SO TELL ME, JOEY POTTER.

02:25.208 --> 02:25.375
HUH?

02:27.083 --> 02:30.959
WILL YOU ALWAYS
LOVE ME...

02:30.959 --> 02:33.000
NO MATTER WHAT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

02:43.333 --> 02:44.875
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.333
WE GET THE HAPPY ENDING.

03:43.208 --> 03:44.458
Dawson: I NEED SOME
FATHER-SON ADVICE.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.417
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU
KNOW SOMETHING REALLY BAD

03:47.417 --> 03:48.208
ABOUT SOMEONE
WHO'S REALLY CLOSE

03:48.208 --> 03:50.458
TO SOMEONE
YOU CARE ABOUT?

03:50.458 --> 03:52.500
DO YOU TELL THE SOMEONE
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT,

03:52.500 --> 03:55.250
OR DO YOU JUST TRY
AND FORGET THAT YOU
KNOW THE BAD THING?

03:55.250 --> 03:57.083
HOW BAD IS BAD?

03:57.083 --> 04:00.208
LET'S SAY "BEYOND BAD" BAD.

04:00.208 --> 04:01.834
WELL, THEN YOU HAVE
2 CHOICES.

04:01.834 --> 04:04.125
YOU CAN EITHER TELL
THE SOMEONE THAT YOU
CARE ABOUT

04:04.125 --> 04:05.375
WHAT THE SOMEONE
THEY REALLY CARE
ABOUT HAS DONE,

04:05.375 --> 04:07.792
OR YOU CAN GO STRAIGHT
TO THE SOMEONE

04:07.792 --> 04:10.208
WHO'S DONE THE BAD THING
AND CONFRONT THEM DIRECTLY

04:10.208 --> 04:12.166
IN THE HOPES THAT THEY'LL
DO THE RIGHT THING.

04:12.166 --> 04:13.500
WOW. DAD'S GOT
NOTHING ON YOU.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.959
AND, UH, SPEAKING
ABOUT YOUR DAD...

04:22.458 --> 04:27.250
HONEY, I'VE DECIDED
TO TAKE THE JOB
IN PHILLY.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.792
I'M GONNA FLY
DOWN THERE TOMORROW

04:28.792 --> 04:31.291
AND OFFICIALLY ACCEPT,
SIGN THE CONTRACT,

04:31.291 --> 04:34.041
AND FIRM UP MY PLANS
TO RELOCATE.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.417
IS THIS REALLY
WHAT YOU WANT?

04:35.417 --> 04:36.458
WELL, THE SOMEONE THAT
I REALLY CARE ABOUT

04:36.458 --> 04:39.417
HAS DONE NOTHING
TO EVEN REMOTELY SUGGEST

04:39.417 --> 04:40.375
HE MAY CARE ABOUT ME.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.750
HEY.

04:46.750 --> 04:47.333
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

04:47.333 --> 04:50.291
UM, GOOD MORNING.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.291
MORNING.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.125
DO YOU HAVE THE REVIEW
FOR GEOMETRY?

04:53.125 --> 04:54.166
I CAN'T FIND MINE.

04:54.166 --> 04:56.125
I WAS COUNTING ON YOU.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.834
2 MINUTES.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.250
HOW'S IT GOING, DAWSON?

05:00.250 --> 05:01.208
GOOD.

05:01.208 --> 05:02.166
READY FOR EXAMS?

05:02.166 --> 05:04.834
HOPE SO. HOW ABOUT YOU?

05:04.834 --> 05:05.917
DOING GOOD.
DOING REAL GOOD.

05:05.917 --> 05:08.208
AND LEGAL?

05:11.583 --> 05:13.500
READY. I HATE EXAMS.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.208
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS,
SINCE THE ICE HOUSE
IS CLOSED

05:16.208 --> 05:17.625
FOR THE LAST STAGE
OF RENOVATIONS,

05:17.625 --> 05:19.500
YOU CAN USE IT
AS A STUDY HAVEN
IF YOU WANT TO.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.125
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF OLD MENU ITEMS
TO EAT UP.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.792
YOU COULD INVITE
YOUR FRIENDS.

05:23.792 --> 05:25.208
SOUNDS COOL. DAWSON?

05:26.208 --> 05:27.959
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.792
THANK YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU.

05:29.792 --> 05:30.834
BYE.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.750
I'LL SEE YOU, MR. POTTER.

05:36.542 --> 05:38.125
SEE YOU, DAWSON.

05:45.333 --> 05:48.375
IF THIS DOESN'T HELP ME
SURVIVE THE MORNING,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.500
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LOT MORE THAN COFFEE

05:50.500 --> 05:53.166
AFTER THAT ALL-NIGHTER
YOU PULLED IN THE DEN
LAST NIGHT.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.917
I'VE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN
STUDY-GEEK ANDIE

05:54.917 --> 05:56.625
PUT THAT MUCH EFFORT
INTO A PAPER.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.667
YEAH, WELL, I HAD A LOT
TO SAY, SO...

05:58.667 --> 06:00.750
YEAH. WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

06:00.750 --> 06:01.792
TEEN SUICIDE.

06:01.792 --> 06:04.625
YOU HAVE A LOT TO SAY
ABOUT TEEN SUICIDE?

06:04.625 --> 06:07.667
SHOULD I START TO PLAN
THE INTERVENTION?

06:07.667 --> 06:08.875
WELL, NOT JUST YET.

06:08.875 --> 06:11.959
I MEAN, I'M NOT
ON THE WINDOW LEDGE
...RIGHT NOW.

06:11.959 --> 06:13.625
RIGHT NOW?

06:13.625 --> 06:16.083
THIS CONVERSATION
JUST TOOK A DECIDEDLY
GRUESOME TURN.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.542
NO, IT'S JUST REALISTIC.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.083
REALISTIC TO WHO?

06:20.083 --> 06:21.708
WELL, TO MOST TEENAGERS.

06:21.708 --> 06:24.333
THE MATERIALS THAT I READ
CITE A HIGH PERCENTAGE

06:24.333 --> 06:26.750
AS HAVING CONSIDERED SUICIDE
AT LEAST ONCE.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.834
COME ON, HAVEN'T YOU EVER?

06:28.834 --> 06:31.375
UH. MAYBE
AT ONE TIME, YEAH,

06:31.375 --> 06:34.375
BUT SINCE
I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH EVERYTHING,

06:34.375 --> 06:36.083
IT HASN'T REALLY
CROSSED MY MIND.

06:36.083 --> 06:38.792
THE WORLD DOESN'T
SCARE ME AS MUCH
AS IT USED TO.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.583
WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

06:40.583 --> 06:41.542
Grams: JENNIFER?

06:46.875 --> 06:48.917
HI, GRAMS.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.875
HOW ARE YOU?

06:52.875 --> 06:54.917
LATE FOR CLASS.

06:54.917 --> 06:55.875
JENNIFER, WAIT.

06:55.875 --> 06:59.333
I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW
WE ENDED THINGS.

06:59.333 --> 07:02.375
I'VE GIVEN IT A GREAT DEAL
OF CONSIDERATION,

07:02.375 --> 07:05.542
AND DESPITE OUR DIFFERENCES,
I WANT YOU TO COME HOME.

07:07.834 --> 07:08.917
I HAVE A HOME NOW.

07:08.917 --> 07:11.291
JENNIFER, I KNOW YOU WANT
YOUR INDEPENDENCE,

07:11.291 --> 07:14.625
BUT THIS SITUATION
ISN'T RIGHT.

07:14.625 --> 07:15.959
LISTEN. JACK IS USED
TO TAKING CARE
OF HIMSELF,

07:15.959 --> 07:18.417
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT I'M DETERMINED
TO LEARN HOW.

07:18.417 --> 07:20.542
TOGETHER WE'RE
GONNA BE FINE.

07:20.542 --> 07:23.667
JACK HAS NO ALTERNATIVE,
YOU DO.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.250
YOU COME HERE
TO WELCOME ME HOME,

07:25.250 --> 07:28.166
BUT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
ADDRESSED WHY I LEFT.

07:28.166 --> 07:29.375
AND TO BE QUITE HONEST,

07:29.375 --> 07:32.250
I DON'T WANT TO GET
INTO IT RIGHT NOW
WITH YOU.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.208
Radio: UNIT 7 CONTINUING
SURVEILLANCE

07:42.208 --> 07:44.792
AT 52 PIER AVENUE.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.458
THAT'S THE ICE HOUSE.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.917
YOU GUYS STAKING IT OUT?

07:48.917 --> 07:50.625
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR CONCERN.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.375
POP, IF THIS MEANS
YOU'RE GONNA START
HARASSING JOEY'S DAD--

07:52.375 --> 07:54.917
I'M NOT HARASSING
ANYBODY.

07:54.917 --> 07:56.291
I WEAR A BADGE,
AND I DO A JOB.

07:56.291 --> 07:59.708
MR. POTTER'S FINALLY
PUTTING HIS FAMILY'S
LIFE BACK TOGETHER.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.125
THE GUY DESERVES A BREAK.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.583
I'LL BE THE JUDGE
OF THAT.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.291
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU GOT A FINAL
TO GET TO.

08:04.291 --> 08:04.750
NOW, DON'T SCREW IT UP.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.583
IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY
THAT YOUR ADVICE

08:08.583 --> 08:11.792
WILL EVER TAKE ON
A POSITIVE TONE?

08:11.792 --> 08:14.000
I'M POSITIVE YOU
BETTER NOT SCREW IT UP.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.208
DAD, YOU KNOW
IT'S REALLY GREAT

08:17.208 --> 08:18.625
THAT WE CAN HAVE
THESE TALKS EVERY MORNING.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.000
SINCE YOUR LITTLE
GIRLFRIEND LEFT,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.792
YOUR ATTITUDE HAS GONE
FROM BAD TO WORSE,

08:24.792 --> 08:26.291
AND I DON'T APPROVE OF IT.

08:26.291 --> 08:29.166
NO GIRL IS WORTH MESSING
UP YOUR LIFE OVER,
YOU HEAR ME?

08:31.333 --> 08:32.792
MAY I GO NOW, SIR?

08:43.332 --> 08:44.333
IS HE TRYING
TO RUN YOU OVER

08:44.333 --> 08:45.708
WITH THE CAR
THIS MORNING?

08:45.708 --> 08:47.667
MAY AS WELL HAVE,
THE BASTARD.

08:47.667 --> 08:48.917
SCREW HIM.

08:48.917 --> 08:50.000
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM ANDIE YET?

08:50.000 --> 08:53.750
UH, NO. NO, I HAVEN'T,
NOT YET. SHE'LL CALL.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.708
Mr. Milo: YOUR FAVORITE
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

08:55.708 --> 08:58.291
WILL BE PROCTORING
THIS EXAM TODAY.

08:58.291 --> 09:00.458
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,

09:00.458 --> 09:01.667
PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND,

09:03.875 --> 09:05.166
AND I WILL COME TO YOU.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.375
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]

09:30.041 --> 09:31.291
DAWSON.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.417
I SUPPOSE YOU, UH...

09:37.625 --> 09:39.041
WANNA KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I THINK I'M DOING.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.792
NO...

09:42.667 --> 09:44.166
NOT REALLY. I'M JUST...

09:45.500 --> 09:48.792
HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT WHATEVER IT IS,
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

09:48.792 --> 09:51.250
I SAW YOU IN THE BACK ROOM
WITH PETE THE OTHER DAY

09:51.250 --> 09:53.083
WHEN I WAS RETURNING
YOUR TOOLS...

09:54.417 --> 09:55.959
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.083
I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT A MAN WHO CLAIMS

09:59.083 --> 10:01.625
TO LOVE HIS CHILDREN
WITH ALL HIS HEART
AND ALL HIS SOUL

10:01.625 --> 10:03.834
WOULD TRAFFIC COCAINE
THROUGH THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.667
DAWSON--
I DO BELIEVE

10:05.667 --> 10:08.792
THAT ANYONE ENGAGED
IN SUCH A BLATANT
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

10:08.792 --> 10:11.583
WOULD PUT THE WELL-BEING
OF HIS FAMILY AHEAD

10:11.583 --> 10:13.083
OF HIS OWN SELFISHNESS

10:13.083 --> 10:15.583
AND REMOVE HIMSELF
FROM THE SITUATION.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.667
AND WHAT IF THAT MAN
FOUND HIMSELF STUCK?

10:19.667 --> 10:21.250
COULD YOU BELIEVE THAT?

10:21.250 --> 10:22.750
WELL, IF THAT WERE TRUE,

10:22.750 --> 10:24.917
A SMART MAN WOULD DO
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING
IN HIS POWER

10:24.917 --> 10:28.583
FOR THE SAKE
OF THE PEOPLE
WHO LOVE HIM...

10:28.583 --> 10:29.750
TO UNSTICK HIMSELF...

10:32.333 --> 10:34.291
AND HE'D DO IT FAST.

10:46.625 --> 10:49.166
SO DAWSON WILL STAY
HERE WITH YOU.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.875
I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE
TO UPROOT HIM NOW,

10:50.875 --> 10:51.291
WITH SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING.

10:51.291 --> 10:53.291
I AGREE.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.542
AND I WAS HOPING THAT YOU'D
MOVE BACK INTO THE HOUSE.

10:55.542 --> 10:57.667
AND THIS SUMMER,
HE CAN COME DOWN
TO PHILADELPHIA,

10:57.667 --> 10:58.208
MAYBE INTERN
AT THE STATION.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.458
IF HE WANTS TO.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.458
IF HE WANTS TO, YES.

11:03.291 --> 11:05.375
MITCHELL, I KNOW
HE'S HAPPY HERE.

11:05.375 --> 11:06.792
BUT YOU'RE
OBVIOUSLY NOT.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.875
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.792
BUT I HAVE A JOB OPPORTUNITY
I WANNA TAKE.

11:10.792 --> 11:12.875
YOU KNOW THAT I'VE OUTGROWN
MY CAREER HERE.

11:12.875 --> 11:15.333
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS THAT YOUR DECISION

11:15.333 --> 11:16.959
IS BASED ON WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOU

11:16.959 --> 11:19.333
AND NOT WHAT'S BEST
FOR OUR SON.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.166
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME

11:21.166 --> 11:23.125
IS ULTIMATELY WHAT'S BEST
FOR OUR SON,

11:23.125 --> 11:25.083
AND HE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
UNDERSTANDS THIS,

11:25.083 --> 11:27.625
WHICH IS MORE THAN
I COULD HOPE FOR FROM YOU.

11:29.917 --> 11:31.834
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU'D LIKE TO TELL ME?

11:33.375 --> 11:35.542
JUST THAT
I'M LEAVING TOMORROW.

11:56.625 --> 12:00.542
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, PACEY?

12:00.542 --> 12:02.500
WE'RE SIGNING
A PEACE TREATY.

12:03.667 --> 12:06.250
STUDYING, POP, STUDYING.

12:08.166 --> 12:09.917
JOEY, IS YOUR
FATHER AROUND?

12:09.917 --> 12:11.500
Mike: HELLO, JOHN.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.792
RESTAURANT'S CLOSED.

12:12.792 --> 12:16.792
HI, MIKE. CAN I SPEAK
TO YOU FOR A MOMENT
IN PRIVATE?

12:16.792 --> 12:18.333
SURE. COME ON BACK.

12:22.834 --> 12:25.208
PACEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:25.208 --> 12:26.333
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.708
MY FATHER'S CRUSADES
ARE HIS OWN DEAL.

12:27.708 --> 12:28.291
Witter: HI, MIKE.
HOW YOU BEEN?

12:28.291 --> 12:29.417
GOOD. AND YOU?

12:29.417 --> 12:31.917
GOOD, THANKS.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.708
LISTEN, YOU SEEN
THIS GUY AROUND?

12:36.417 --> 12:38.041
PETE LEWIS.
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND.

12:38.041 --> 12:41.375
YEAH, WITH
AN ALLEGED HISTORY
IN NARCOTICS, MIKE.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.083
I WOULDN'T KNOW, JOHN.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.125
WE HAVE A STRICTLY
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP.

12:45.125 --> 12:48.250
HE STOPPED BY FOR A VISIT--
CATCH UP, THAT'S ALL.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.708
EXCUSE ME.

12:51.792 --> 12:53.542
FIND EVERYTHING
YOU NEED,
MR. WITTER?

12:53.542 --> 12:54.875
SURE DID, JOEY.
THANK YOU.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.792
YOU NEED ANY MORE
HELP BACK HERE, DAD?

12:58.667 --> 12:59.959
NO, WE'RE DONE.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.041
LISTEN, HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.458
THE PLACE IS
LOOKING GREAT, MIKE.

13:02.458 --> 13:03.583
THANKS.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.250
HEY, STOP BY NEXT WEEK
WHEN WE'RE OPEN.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.583
I'LL GET YOU
A FREE DINNER.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.291
I'LL DO THAT. THANKS.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.750
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:15.750 --> 13:19.083
HE'S JUST GIVING ME
AN OFFICIAL WELCOME,
THAT'S ALL, JOE.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.667
GO BACK TO YOUR FRIENDS.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.083
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA
LEAVE US ALONE,
ARE THEY?

13:23.083 --> 13:24.625
NOT FOR A WHILE.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.333
I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO IGNORE THEM.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.041
YOU OK?

13:40.291 --> 13:43.166
WHY IS PACEY'S DAD
DOING THIS?

13:43.166 --> 13:44.250
BECAUSE THAT'S HIS JOB.

13:44.250 --> 13:45.458
NO, IT'S HIS JOB TO SERVE

13:45.458 --> 13:48.625
AND PROTECT CAPESIDE
FROM CRIMINALS,
NOT MY DAD.

13:48.625 --> 13:51.542
HE DOESN'T BELONG
IN THAT CATEGORY ANYMORE.

13:51.542 --> 13:52.708
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE MAD--

13:52.708 --> 13:54.917
YOU SHOULD BE MAD, TOO.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.083
YOU'RE PART
OF THIS FAMILY NOW.

13:59.917 --> 14:01.125
WHEN YOU SAY IT
LIKE THAT, I'M FURIOUS.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.333
YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE
SHE WANTS TO RECONCILE
YOUR DIFFERENCES.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.041
TO THE UNTRAINED EAR, MAYBE,

14:40.041 --> 14:43.166
BUT TO ME IT'S JUST
THE SAME DOUBLESPEAK,

14:43.166 --> 14:45.500
AND I'M NOT THE GIRL
SHE WANTS AROUND.

14:46.375 --> 14:49.333
SHE DID ASK YOU BACK.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.750
I DON'T WANNA GO BACK.

14:51.750 --> 14:55.708
WELL, NO ONE'S SAYING
THAT YOU HAVE TO,
BUT SHE IS RIGHT.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.750
YOUR SITUATION
ISN'T MINE.

15:00.875 --> 15:04.291
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I'VE BEEN UNDER
THE SAME KIND OF SCRUTINY?

15:04.291 --> 15:06.000
WE ALL HAVE
OUR ROUGH HOURS, JEN.

15:08.667 --> 15:10.834
I THOUGHT THAT WE HAD
DEVELOPED A CLOSENESS.

15:11.417 --> 15:13.333
WE HAVE.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.834
SO THEN WHY DO YOU
WANT ME TO GO?

15:16.834 --> 15:17.667
I NEVER SAID THAT
I WANTED YOU TO GO.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.583
YES, YOU DID.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.417
I MEAN, BRINGING UP
MY GRANDMOTHER,

15:21.417 --> 15:23.083
TALKING ABOUT ME
MOVING BACK--

15:23.083 --> 15:24.834
IT'S OBVIOUS
WHERE THAT LEADS.

15:24.834 --> 15:26.750
IS THIS WHAT
YOU DID WITH HER?

15:26.750 --> 15:27.917
YOU TURNED HER WORDS
ALL AROUND

15:27.917 --> 15:29.333
UNTIL YOU'RE
CONVINCED THAT SHE
WANTS YOU TO GO?

15:29.333 --> 15:32.291
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.917
NO, I THINK I DO.

15:33.917 --> 15:36.917
YOU ACT LIKE MOVING
IN WITH ME IS GONNA BE
SOME GREAT SALVATION.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.708
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING. IT ISN'T,

15:38.708 --> 15:40.041
BECAUSE MY DAD'S
GONNA HAVE TO SELL
THE HOUSE SOON,

15:40.041 --> 15:42.542
AND THEN WE'RE BOTH
GONNA BE HOMELESS.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.959
HOPEFULLY BY THEN I WILL HAVE
PUT MYSELF OUT OF MY MISERY.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.583
WHAT ARE--
DON'T SAY THAT.

15:46.583 --> 15:47.250
DON'T WORRY, JACK.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.208
STATISTICS ARE ON MY SIDE,

15:49.208 --> 15:50.083
BUT I'LL BE GONE BY TONIGHT.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.291
YOU STAY OUTTA THIS, PACEY.

16:05.291 --> 16:08.125
YOU AND I GOT A WHOLE
'NOTHER PROBLEM
TO DEAL WITH.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.083
WELL, OF COURSE WE DO.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.708
YOU HAD A PHONE CALL
AT THE HOUSE.

16:10.708 --> 16:11.583
ANDIE?

16:11.583 --> 16:13.792
MR. MILO. HE'S WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

16:13.792 --> 16:16.208
HE TOLD ME YOU'VE BLOWN
2 OF YOUR FINALS.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.375
I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL, OK?

16:17.375 --> 16:19.458
PACEY, HE SAID YOU
DIDN'T WRITE WORD ONE

16:19.458 --> 16:20.208
ON EITHER EXAM.
THAT TRUE?

16:21.875 --> 16:24.000
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.083
I WAS THINKING THAT IT
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER, OK?

16:26.083 --> 16:27.291
THE HELL IT DOESN'T.

16:27.291 --> 16:29.166
YOU GET YOUR THINGS.
YOU'RE COMING HOME.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.291
NO.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.291
I DON'T WANT YOU
HANGING OUT HERE, PACEY.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.083
MR. POTTER'S
A KNOWN FELON.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.083
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME
LOOK GOOD.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.708
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

16:36.708 --> 16:39.041
GET YOUR STUFF.

16:39.041 --> 16:39.959
I SAID NO!

16:39.959 --> 16:41.291
I SAID GET YOUR STUFF!

16:41.291 --> 16:43.041
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

16:49.959 --> 16:51.417
I'LL BE IN THE CAR.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.708
DOES ANYBODY SMELL THAT?

17:10.541 --> 17:12.250
SMOKE.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.750
WHERE'S IT
COMING FROM?

17:13.750 --> 17:14.750
THERE'S A FIRE.

17:14.750 --> 17:15.791
FROM THE BACK.

17:15.791 --> 17:16.834
JOEY!

17:16.834 --> 17:18.083
DAD!

17:18.500 --> 17:20.834
DAD. DAD!

17:23.416 --> 17:24.791
DISPATCH, THIS IS
CHIEF WITTER.

17:24.791 --> 17:26.750
Dawson: WAIT, WAIT!

17:26.750 --> 17:28.333
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

17:29.417 --> 17:30.875
DAD! DAD!

17:31.291 --> 17:34.250
DAD! DAD!

17:34.250 --> 17:35.417
JOEY!

17:36.333 --> 17:37.834
JOEY, GET OUTTA HERE!

17:37.834 --> 17:39.375
DAD! NO!

17:39.375 --> 17:40.458
GET EVERYONE OUTTA HERE!

17:40.458 --> 17:41.583
DAD!

17:41.583 --> 17:43.083
Witter: STAY BACK,
STAY BACK!

17:43.083 --> 17:46.708
EVERYBODY OUT!
EVERYBODY GET OUT!
JACK, GET HER OUT!

17:46.708 --> 17:48.417
JEN, JEN, COME ON!

17:53.625 --> 17:55.166
LET GO OF ME!

17:57.583 --> 17:59.500
DAD!

18:05.417 --> 18:06.875
I CAN'T GET THERE.
STAND BACK!

18:31.417 --> 18:32.625
OH, MY GOD.

18:48.667 --> 18:51.125
DAD.

19:16.959 --> 19:19.125
Dawson: IS THIS YOUR IDEA
OF TAKING CARE OF THINGS?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.834
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE, DAWSON.

19:21.834 --> 19:22.750
YOU NEED TO GO
TO THE POLICE

19:22.750 --> 19:24.542
AND TELL THEM
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

19:24.542 --> 19:26.583
I CAN'T.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.625
THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.333
I'M ALL CHECKED OUT.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.041
THEY ASKED
FOR THE HERO NEXT.

19:33.041 --> 19:33.333
THAT WOULD BE YOU.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.041
I'M NOT A HERO, JOEY.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.333
DON'T BE MODEST, DAWSON.

19:38.333 --> 19:41.000
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
YOU'RE THE HERO.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.625
SOME SITUATIONS
ARE TOO TRAGIC
TO HAVE A HERO.

19:44.834 --> 19:45.458
THIS IS ONE OF THEM.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.542
DAWSON!
ARE YOU OK?

19:54.542 --> 19:56.417
I'M FINE.
I'M ALL RIGHT.

19:56.417 --> 19:57.417
YEAH?

19:57.417 --> 19:57.500
YEAH.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.250
Witter: THAT BASTARD
WAS LYING TO ME.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.917
HE'S IN IT
UP TO HIS NECK,
AND HE KNOWS IT.

20:12.917 --> 20:16.125
COME ON. YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW IF THIS HAS
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.291
A RANDOM
ARSON INCIDENT

20:18.291 --> 20:19.750
IN THE MIDDLE
OF CAPESIDE?

20:19.750 --> 20:22.166
LET'S CONSIDER
THE LIKELIHOOD
OF THAT, PACEY.

20:23.917 --> 20:24.542
IF GOD HADN'T
BLESSED YOU

20:24.542 --> 20:26.166
WITH MY GOOD LOOKS,

20:26.166 --> 20:27.625
I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHOSE SON YOU WERE.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.208
WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE
YOURSELF HOME

20:29.208 --> 20:31.417
BEFORE YOU MAKE ANOTHER
EMBARRASSING COMMENT?

20:31.417 --> 20:33.208
I THINK I'LL WALK.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.500
AS IF I CARED.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.041
NOBODY ASSUMED
YOU DID, POP.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.542
YOU'LL HAVE
TO EXCUSE MY SON, BOYS.

20:40.542 --> 20:41.875
HIS GIRLFRIEND MOVES AWAY,

20:41.875 --> 20:43.458
AND SUDDENLY
IT'S HIS TIME OF MONTH.

20:43.458 --> 20:44.375
SCREW YOU, OK?

20:46.875 --> 20:48.875
COME HERE.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.125
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME,
ALL RIGHT?

20:50.125 --> 20:51.542
YOU DON'T TOUCH ME
AGAIN EVER!

20:51.542 --> 20:53.417
FINALLY MY BOY
GETS A PAIR.

20:53.417 --> 20:55.417
AND ALL IT TOOK WAS
GETTING HIS HEART BROKE

20:55.417 --> 20:58.333
BY SOME LITTLE GIRL
WITH A FEW SCREWS LOOSE.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.625
ANDIE DID MORE
FOR MY LIFE IN 6 MONTHS

21:03.625 --> 21:06.667
THAN YOU DID IN 16 YEARS,
YOU ROTTEN SON OF A BITCH.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.125
SO IF YOU WANNA
MAKE FUN OF ME,

21:08.125 --> 21:10.583
YOU WANNA BUST ON ME,
THAT'S FINE.

21:10.583 --> 21:14.750
BUT YOU MAKE ONE MORE EVEN
SLIGHTLY DISPARAGING COMMENT
ABOUT THE WOMAN I LOVE,

21:14.750 --> 21:16.291
AND I SWEAR TO GOD,
YOU'RE GONNA BE
POLICING THIS TOWN

21:16.291 --> 21:19.083
FROM A HOSPITAL BED.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

21:20.542 --> 21:22.500
AND ONE MORE THING.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.583
EVEN IF MR. POTTER
WAS INVOLVED IN ALL THIS,

21:25.583 --> 21:28.708
HE'S STILL 10 TIMES
THE FATHER YOU EVER WERE.

21:37.625 --> 21:38.458
THERE'S NO REASON
IF WE CAN GET

21:38.458 --> 21:40.583
AN INSPECTOR OUT
THERE TOMORROW

21:40.583 --> 21:42.041
THAT WE CAN'T
FILE A CLAIM--

21:42.041 --> 21:43.333
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:43.333 --> 21:45.792
YOUR SISTER AND I
ARE GOING OVER
THE INSURANCE PAPERS.

21:45.792 --> 21:48.959
I MEAN WITH THE POLICE.
WHY IS THE ICE HOUSE
TAPED OFF?

21:48.959 --> 21:49.959
THE FIRE WAS
ARSON-RELATED.

21:49.959 --> 21:52.166
IT'S TYPICAL
INVESTIGATIVE
PROCEDURE.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.125
SO THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
GOING ON?

21:53.125 --> 21:55.208
JOEY, WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

21:55.208 --> 21:56.458
I'M JUST ASKING DAD

21:56.458 --> 21:58.792
IF HE KNOWS WHY THE POLICE
ARE SO INTERESTED IN THE FIRE

21:58.792 --> 22:00.792
OR WHY THERE WAS EVEN
A FIRE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

22:00.792 --> 22:03.041
AS GOD IS MY WITNESS,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

22:03.041 --> 22:04.166
YOU'RE POSITIVE?

22:04.166 --> 22:05.959
JOSEPHINE POTTER,
YOU STOP RIGHT NOW.

22:05.959 --> 22:06.458
NO, I WANT HIM TO SWEAR.

22:10.208 --> 22:13.000
I JUST SWORE
TO YOU, JOEY.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.166
I KNOW, BUT I NEED YOU
TO SWEAR AGAIN.

22:16.166 --> 22:19.041
I NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
THE TRUTH.

22:19.041 --> 22:20.542
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO STARTED THAT FIRE?

22:23.875 --> 22:25.750
NO.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.959
OK.

22:32.333 --> 22:34.625
Mitchell: THERE'S NO QUESTION.

22:34.625 --> 22:36.333
YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE POLICE.

22:36.333 --> 22:37.792
AND IMMEDIATELY.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.000
WHOEVER JOEY'S DAD
IS DEALING WITH,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.708
IF THEY ARE CAPABLE
OF BURNING DOWN
A BUILDING,

22:41.708 --> 22:43.917
HONEY, THEY ARE CAPABLE
OF MUCH WORSE.

22:43.917 --> 22:45.250
I REALIZE THAT,
BUT HOW CAN I DO
THIS TO JOEY?

22:45.250 --> 22:46.708
SHE FINALLY GETS
HER FAMILY BACK,

22:46.708 --> 22:50.125
AND I'M GONNA BE THE ONE WHO'S
GONNA TAKE IT AWAY FROM HER?

22:50.125 --> 22:52.583
Mitchell: JOEY'S FATHER
IS RESPONSIBLE HERE,
NOT YOU.

22:52.583 --> 22:54.959
ALL RIGHT, BUT WHAT IF--
WHAT IF I JUST GAVE
HIM SOME TIME?

22:54.959 --> 22:56.417
MAYBE HE COULD FIX THINGS.

22:56.417 --> 22:57.625
THE MAN JUST GOT OUT
OF PRISON LESS THAN
A MONTH AGO,

22:57.625 --> 22:59.375
AND HE'S ALREADY
COMMITTED THE SAME CRIME

22:59.375 --> 23:01.875
THAT PUT HIM THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.375
I JUST WISH I NEVER...
SAW WHAT I SAW.

23:03.375 --> 23:06.750
THERE IS A REASON
THAT YOU DID, HONEY.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.250
JOEY'S IN DANGER,
AND SHE NEEDS
YOUR STRENGTH,

23:09.250 --> 23:10.834
EVEN IF THAT STRENGTH
DOESN'T COME

23:10.834 --> 23:12.333
IN THE WAY
SHE MAY WANT.

23:12.333 --> 23:14.208
YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE POLICE.

23:14.208 --> 23:16.125
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
ELSE LEFT TO DO.

23:19.708 --> 23:20.917
THERE IS ONE THING.

23:22.417 --> 23:24.667
Jack: YOU DIDN'T MAKE
A MOVE TONIGHT.

23:24.667 --> 23:26.792
YOU STOOD THERE,
AND YOU WATCHED THAT FIRE,

23:26.792 --> 23:28.750
AND YOU DIDN'T RUN
AWAY FROM IT. WHY?

23:28.750 --> 23:30.417
BECAUSE I WAS JUST
IN SHOCK, ALL RIGHT?

23:30.417 --> 23:31.959
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

23:33.375 --> 23:36.166
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED, JACK.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.375
I WANT THE TRUTH, JEN.

23:43.834 --> 23:46.166
ALL YOUR LITTLE COMMENTS--

23:46.166 --> 23:46.583
HOW MUCH DO YOU MEAN THEM?

23:49.417 --> 23:50.917
I'M NOT THE KIND
OF PERSON

23:50.917 --> 23:52.375
THAT WOULD TAKE
THEIR OWN LIFE,

23:52.375 --> 23:54.333
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING, JACK. BUT...

23:58.875 --> 24:00.875
BUT WHEN I WAS
STANDING THERE...

24:02.375 --> 24:03.500
STARING AT THAT FIRE,

24:03.500 --> 24:06.125
I JUST KEPT THINKING
THAT MAYBE...

24:08.417 --> 24:10.208
MAYBE THIS IS FATE'S WAY

24:10.208 --> 24:11.792
OF PROVIDING ME
WITH AN OUT.

24:15.750 --> 24:18.375
JACK, I DON'T WANNA DIE,
BUT I JUST DIDN'T...

24:19.208 --> 24:22.500
CARE ENOUGH TO RUN.

24:28.959 --> 24:31.542
I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.583
I KNOW HOW NUMBING THAT...

24:37.417 --> 24:39.417
PAIN OF HATING YOURSELF IS.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.875
AND HOW IT MAKES YOU WANNA
PUSH EVERYBODY AWAY,

24:43.875 --> 24:47.250
ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE THAT
CARE ABOUT YOU THE MOST.

24:50.792 --> 24:52.083
BUT YOU CAN'T.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.041
NOT IF YOU PLAN
ON EVER BEING HAPPY.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.333
HEY.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.834
HEY. YOU CALLED.

25:28.834 --> 25:29.917
YEAH. UM...

25:31.041 --> 25:33.250
AHHH...

25:34.333 --> 25:37.250
WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE.

25:37.250 --> 25:40.500
SO, UM...I'M JUST
GONNA SAY IT QUICKLY.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.333
JOEY, YOUR FATHER'S
DEALING DRUGS AGAIN.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.083
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

25:47.083 --> 25:48.667
YES, I DO.
I CAUGHT HIM.

25:50.542 --> 25:51.875
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.
THIS FIRE TONIGHT

25:51.875 --> 25:56.375
WAS NOT ALL,
BUT PARTIALLY,
HIS RESPONSIBILITY.

25:56.375 --> 25:57.583
I TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.750
I TALKED TO MY PARENTS
ABOUT IT.

25:59.750 --> 26:03.041
I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO HAVE TO KNOW.

26:03.041 --> 26:05.625
BUT NOW IT--
IT'S GONE TOO FAR.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.834
HE TOLD ME HE HAD
NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE FIRE.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.750
HE SWORE TO ME.
HE'S LYING TO YOU.

26:09.750 --> 26:10.750
WELL, I BELIEVE HIM.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.000
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO BELIE--
NO, I DO.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.542
JOEY, WHY WOULD I
LIE ABOUT THIS?

26:14.542 --> 26:15.875
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.959
'CAUSE YOU NEED
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

26:17.959 --> 26:20.166
ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS
SITUATION NOW.

26:20.166 --> 26:23.333
YOUR FATHER CAN HELP
APPREHEND THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

26:23.333 --> 26:27.583
IF WE WENT TO THE POLICE,
MAYBE YOU COULD WORK
SOMETHING OUT FOR YOUR DAD.

26:28.542 --> 26:30.000
YOU WANT ME
TO TURN MY FATHER IN?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.875
WHAT KIND OF A PERSON
DO YOU THINK I AM?
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

26:31.875 --> 26:33.542
JOEY,
THIS ISN'T MY FAULT.
YES, IT IS!

26:33.542 --> 26:36.000
THERE'S
NO OTHER OPTION!

26:36.000 --> 26:38.750
JUST COULDN'T LEAVE
WELL ENOUGH ALONE?
YOU HAD TO GET INVOLVED?

26:38.750 --> 26:40.917
JOEY, I LOVE YOU.
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
RISK YOUR LIFE

26:40.917 --> 26:43.041

ISN'T PROTECTING YOU.

DAWSON, THIS IS MY FATHER.
I'M BEGGING YOU. PLEASE,
JUST STAY OUT OF IT.

26:46.542 --> 26:47.542
I CAN'T.

FOR MY FAMILY'S SAKE,
BUT FOR US.

I'M TELLING YOU, DAWSON...
WE WON'T SURVIVE THIS.

26:56.667 --> 26:59.083
THAT'S A RISK THAT
I'M WILLING TO TAKE...

26:59.083 --> 27:04.291
BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU
MORE THAN I CARE
ABOUT MYSELF.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.625
AND SOMEBODY HAS TO
DO THE RIGHT THING.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.500
IF YOU CAN'T,
THEN I WILL.

I HAVE ENOUGH PROOF
TO ARREST YOUR FATHER,

HE'S GOIN' AWAY
FOR LIFE.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.291
YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE PROOF?

27:33.291 --> 27:34.750
SO WHY SHOULD I
GO ALONG WITH THIS?

27:38.583 --> 27:41.125
JOEY, THE MEN
WHO TIPPED ME OFF
TO YOUR FATHER'S DEALING

27:41.125 --> 27:42.625
ARE HIS COMPETITORS.

27:42.625 --> 27:44.041
THEY'RE ALSO RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT FIRE
LAST NIGHT.

27:44.041 --> 27:47.417
NOW, IF YOUR FATHER
DOESN'T HELP ME
GET THEM,

27:47.417 --> 27:51.000
THEY'RE GONNA
KEEP HELPIN' ME
UNTIL I GET HIM.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.875
YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO.

27:53.875 --> 27:57.625
HE IS PUTTING
YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY
IN DANGER, JOEY.

27:57.625 --> 28:00.667
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S MY  FAMILY,
MR. WITTER.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.875
AND WHAT BENEFITS MY FAMILY
IS BEING TOGETHER
AND TRUSTING EACH OTHER.

28:07.125 --> 28:10.208
DON'T YOU THINK
YOUR FATHER'S
BETRAYED THAT TRUST?

28:13.708 --> 28:16.625
YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW
I THINK I TRUST HIM

28:16.625 --> 28:18.208
A LOT MORE THAN I TRUST
ANY OF YOU.

28:20.375 --> 28:22.083
COULD WE JUST HAVE
A COUPLE MINUTES ALONE?

28:23.875 --> 28:23.959
YEAH.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.291
HE WANTS TO HELP, JOEY.

28:40.291 --> 28:42.375
HE CARES. WE ALL DO.

28:42.375 --> 28:44.834
I APPRECIATE
THE CONCERN, DAWSON.

28:44.834 --> 28:48.250
WHAT I DON'T APPRECIATE
IS HAVING THE SOLUTION
FORCED DOWN MY THROAT.

28:48.250 --> 28:49.041
I TRIED TO TALK
TO YOUR FATHER.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.208
YEAH, THAT'S
JUST IT, DAWSON.

28:50.208 --> 28:53.250
YOU TRIED. BUT
HE'S NOT YOUR FATHER,
DAWSON.

28:53.250 --> 28:55.041
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF HE GOES OFF TO PRISON

28:55.041 --> 28:55.792
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR  LIFE, DOES IT?

28:55.792 --> 28:57.667
THAT'S WHY I CAME TO YOU.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.208
YEAH, WITH THE DECISION
ALREADY MADE.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.041

WAS ANOTHER OPTION.

29:01.041 --> 29:02.917
THERE ISN'T. YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND THAT.

29:04.667 --> 29:08.458
I UNDERSTAND, DAWSON,
THAT IN THAT BLACK-AND-WHITE
WORLD IN WHICH YOU LIVE,

29:08.458 --> 29:10.708
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY CHOICES.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.208
BUT THAT'S NOT MY WORLD.

AND THAT'S WHAT
MAKES US DIFFERENT,

FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU,

AND THAT IS WHAT
IS TEARING US APART.

THAN THAT, GALE.

29:50.875 --> 29:52.291
THE PAST 24 HOURS...

29:54.375 --> 29:56.625
HAVE REMINDED ME
WHAT I LOVE SO MUCH

29:56.625 --> 29:58.041
ABOUT BEING PART
OF OUR FAMILY.

30:00.625 --> 30:03.291
DAWSON WAS ABLE
TO COUNT ON US
WHEN HE NEEDED TO,

30:03.291 --> 30:06.625
AND I...FELT
LIKE A FATHER AGAIN.
YOU KNOW?

30:09.792 --> 30:11.917
AND, IF YOU CAN
BELIEVE IT...
A HUSBAND.

30:14.291 --> 30:14.959

30:22.375 --> 30:23.291

30:23.291 --> 30:25.708

30:26.333 --> 30:28.375

30:30.375 --> 30:31.083

30:33.333 --> 30:34.458
EVER SINCE YOU LEFT,

30:34.458 --> 30:37.500
I HAVE PRAYED FOR THE DAY
THAT YOU'D COME BACK.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.041
AND WHEN
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN,

30:40.667 --> 30:43.000
I STARTED SEEING PHILLY
FOR WHAT IT WAS.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.583
AND ODDLY ENOUGH,
IT FELT MORE RIGHT

30:46.583 --> 30:47.834
THAN ANYTHING HAD
IN A LONG TIME.

30:47.834 --> 30:50.792
BUT WE CAN BE RIGHT
AGAIN, TOO, GALE.

30:52.125 --> 30:55.041
I WANT MY OLD LIFE
BACK. I WANT US.

30:55.041 --> 30:56.083
NO. YOU WANT WHAT WE HAD.

30:58.875 --> 31:01.250
WE'LL NEVER HAVE
THAT AGAIN, MITCH.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.959
SO...

31:03.959 --> 31:06.834
I'M GONNA DO
SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT
FOR BOTH OF US.

31:06.834 --> 31:09.667
I'M GONNA TAKE
THE UNPLANNED ROUTE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE...

31:09.667 --> 31:11.542
IN THE HOPES THAT...

31:13.125 --> 31:14.125
WHATEVER WE LOST...

31:15.250 --> 31:17.583
WE'LL BE ABLE
TO STUMBLE UPON AGAIN.

31:31.708 --> 31:33.041
AND DID DAWSON
UNDERSTAND?

31:35.708 --> 31:38.125
HE UNDERSTANDS
HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.041
THAT'S ENOUGH,
I THINK.

32:13.041 --> 32:15.000
I HAVE 3 CONDITIONS.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.333
OH?

32:17.333 --> 32:20.000
1...THAT WE
ADDRESS THE REALITY

32:20.000 --> 32:22.875
OF WHY THIS DIDN'T
WORK OUT BEFORE.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.333
I KNOW THAT I MADE
SOME MISTAKES,

32:27.333 --> 32:30.250
BUT...BUT EVEN
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR,

32:30.250 --> 32:33.291
I NEVER FELT
LIKE I WAS COMFORTABLE
LIVING HERE WITH YOU.

32:34.875 --> 32:36.583
I NEVER FELT LIKE
I WAS GOOD ENOUGH.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.083
OH, JENNIFER, YOU--

32:38.083 --> 32:38.125

32:41.166 --> 32:42.750
I NEED YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE

32:42.750 --> 32:45.166
THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT IN MY LIFE...

32:45.166 --> 32:48.333
MORE THAN MOST GIRLS
MY AGE, AND...

32:48.333 --> 32:52.125
AND WHAT I NEED
IS YOUR SUPPORT,
NOT YOUR JUDGMENT.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.917
ESPECIALLY
NOT BIBLICAL JUDGMENT.

32:53.917 --> 32:57.166
I THINK
I CAN MANAGE THAT.

32:58.875 --> 33:01.458
WHAT YOU NEED
TO UNDERSTAND, GRAMS,
IS THAT...

33:03.458 --> 33:07.458
I DON'T NEED
A LEGAL GUARDIAN
TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE...

33:07.458 --> 33:10.125
A-AND THAT I CAN
HANDLE A LOT MORE THAN
YOU MIGHT THINK, BUT...

33:14.667 --> 33:18.750
BUT THAT WHAT I WANT...
IS TO LIVE HERE WITH YOU.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.875
I WANT A FAMILY.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.291
I WANT US TO TAKE
CARE OF EACH OTHER.

33:28.041 --> 33:30.458
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE ANYMORE.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.166
NEITHER DO I.

33:45.708 --> 33:47.750
WAS THERE A THIRD?

33:48.417 --> 33:49.792
YES.

33:51.291 --> 33:54.667
THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE
ALONE ANYMORE, EITHER.

34:04.041 --> 34:04.291
WELL...

34:06.875 --> 34:10.500
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO CLEAR OUT
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S ROOM

34:10.500 --> 34:11.625

34:29.083 --> 34:31.458

DOIN' HERE?

34:31.458 --> 34:33.750
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
YOU PUNCHED ME.

34:33.750 --> 34:35.542
WELL, IF YOU CAME
LOOKIN' FOR AN APOLOGY,

34:35.542 --> 34:37.208
YOU'RE BARKIN'
UP THE WRONG TREE.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.291
NO. I DON'T NEED ONE.
I DESERVED IT.

34:40.875 --> 34:43.250
GOOD FOR YOU
FOR DOIN' IT.

34:48.667 --> 34:49.750
YOU HAD ANOTHER
PHONE CALL TODAY.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.208

34:53.875 --> 34:54.750

THAT ONE.

35:01.708 --> 35:02.250

35:05.166 --> 35:06.417
SHE SOUNDED
SWEET AS HELL, PACEY.

35:11.166 --> 35:13.333
SO I'M SORRY,
WHAT I SAID YESTERDAY.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.291
I--I REALLY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HER.

35:17.834 --> 35:19.166

35:19.166 --> 35:20.333

35:22.875 --> 35:26.583
AS LITTLE AS I KNOW
ABOUT HER, I...

35:26.583 --> 35:29.041
I KNOW EVEN LESS
ABOUT YOU--MY OWN SON.

35:31.417 --> 35:34.208
I REALIZED THAT AS ANDIE
WAS TRYING TO FILL ME IN

35:34.208 --> 35:36.750
ON WHAT YOU TWO
HAD BEEN THROUGH...

35:39.875 --> 35:41.667
I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT ANY OF THAT.

35:47.834 --> 35:49.583
SHE SAID YOU WERE
HER HERO.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.041
IT WAS NICE TO HEAR.

36:01.917 --> 36:05.583
ANYWAY, I CALLED
THE SCHOOL, AND I...
EXPLAINED THINGS TO THEM.

36:05.583 --> 36:07.792
THEY'RE GONNA LET YOU
MAKE UP THE FINALS NEXT WEEK

36:07.792 --> 36:09.917

WHEN YOU FEEL UP TO IT.

36:13.625 --> 36:14.750
UH...

36:15.583 --> 36:16.500
THANK YOU.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.875
WELL, THAT'S
THE LEAST I COULD DO.

36:27.125 --> 36:29.000
I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T BEEN
THE KIND OF FATHER

36:29.000 --> 36:30.500

YOU COULD SHARE
YOUR STORY WITH.

36:40.750 --> 36:41.500
THERE IS  ONE
OTHER THING HERE.

36:45.792 --> 36:47.834

YOU RUN OFF TO

37:59.208 --> 38:02.041
ARE YOU DEALING DRUGS
AGAIN?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.291
[WEEPING SOFTLY]

38:14.834 --> 38:16.208
YES.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.208
WHY?

38:23.208 --> 38:26.000
JOEY, I WISH I HAD
AN ANSWER FOR YOU.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.291
I WANTED TO PROVIDE
FOR MY FAMILY.

38:28.291 --> 38:31.208
NOT JUST SURVIVE,
BUT PROVIDE.

38:31.208 --> 38:34.708
I THOUGHT IF I JUST MADE
A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY,

38:34.708 --> 38:38.583
GET AHEAD,
THEN MAYBE THERE'D BE
A CHANCE FOR US.

38:38.583 --> 38:41.625
YEAH, BUT YOU SERVED
YOUR TIME. YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO START A NEW LIFE.

38:41.625 --> 38:44.375
I WANTED TO, JOEY.
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND

38:44.375 --> 38:45.583
IS THE BURDEN
THAT I FELT.

38:45.583 --> 38:47.000
WE  WERE A BURDEN?

38:47.000 --> 38:49.291
NOT YOU! YOU GIRLS
ARE MY GIFT.

38:49.291 --> 38:52.041
THE BURDEN
WAS SELF-INFLICTED.

38:52.041 --> 38:54.417
EVER SINCE I MOVED
BACK IN HERE WITH YOU,

38:54.417 --> 38:56.667
I HAVE BEEN HAUNTED...

38:56.667 --> 38:59.333
BY THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT I HAVE FAILED YOU.

38:59.333 --> 39:02.125
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

39:02.125 --> 39:04.875
I MEAN, WE COULD'VE
FOUND A WAY. WE COULD'VE
DONE SOMETHING.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.625
I WAS JUST
TOO WEAK, JOEY.

39:14.166 --> 39:15.333
I HAVE BEEN UP...

39:15.333 --> 39:17.750
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
AFTER NIGHT

39:17.750 --> 39:22.250
WONDERING WHAT
COMPELLED ME TO TAKE
THAT ROAD BOTH TIMES,

39:22.250 --> 39:24.917
AND I JUST DON'T
HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU.

39:24.917 --> 39:26.041
BUT I TRUSTED YOU.

39:26.041 --> 39:28.917
AND YOU LIED.

39:28.917 --> 39:30.375
AND YOU RUINED
EVERYTHING

39:30.375 --> 39:31.959
THAT BESSIE AND I
HAVE WORKED SO HARD FOR.

39:31.959 --> 39:36.458
I MEAN, WE COULD'VE
DIED IN THAT FIRE, AND
IT WOULD'VE BEEN YOUR FAULT.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.708
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW,
AND I HATE MYSELF
FOR IT SO MUCH

39:38.708 --> 39:40.708
THAT I WISH I  HAD DIED
IN THAT FIRE!

39:42.792 --> 39:45.834
I JUST...
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

39:47.375 --> 39:48.583
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO FIX THIS.

39:50.708 --> 39:52.625
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

40:05.959 --> 40:07.625
I'M SORRY, TOO.

40:09.375 --> 40:11.375
I TOOK CARE OF IT
FOR YOU.

40:18.542 --> 40:19.625
[WHISPERING]
I'm so sorry.

[CAR MOTOR STARTS]

42:00.959 --> 42:02.625
HOW ARE YOU FEELIN'?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.583
LIKE HELL.

42:07.500 --> 42:10.166
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

42:10.166 --> 42:10.625
NO, THANK YOU.

42:16.291 --> 42:16.708
YOU DID THE RIGHT
THING, JOEY.

42:18.708 --> 42:20.625
NO, DAWSON.

42:20.625 --> 42:21.792
YOU  DID THE RIGHT THING.

42:23.625 --> 42:24.834
WHAT I DID...

42:26.000 --> 42:27.875
THE WORD "RIGHT"
DOESN'T EVEN
COME CLOSE TO.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.542
WE BOTH DID
WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

42:39.667 --> 42:42.917
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE,

42:42.917 --> 42:44.417
SO I'LL SAY IT QUICKLY.

42:45.583 --> 42:48.583
I HOPE ONE DAY
THAT I WILL BE ABLE

42:48.583 --> 42:49.834
TO FORGIVE MY FATHER
FOR ALL THIS.

42:52.708 --> 42:55.917
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I'LL EVER BE ABLE
TO FORGIVE MYSELF.

42:58.542 --> 43:00.000
BUT I KNOW...

43:00.875 --> 43:02.375
THAT I WILL NEVER...

43:02.375 --> 43:04.083
FORGIVE YOU.

43:07.375 --> 43:09.625
YOU SEE, DAWSON, THERE
ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

43:09.625 --> 43:11.625
THAT LOVE CANNOT OVERCOME.

43:11.625 --> 43:13.166
AND FROM NOW ON...

43:16.166 --> 43:18.041
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW YOU.

43:31.125 --> 43:32.792
[TO HIMSELF]
SEE YA, JOEY.
