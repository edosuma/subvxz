02:06.500 --> 02:08.764
You have to ask yourself...

02:08.836 --> 02:12.431
what brought the person to this point.

02:12.506 --> 02:18.001
What was seen in his face,
his manner, that channeled him here.

02:18.078 --> 02:21.138
You have to convince yourself...

02:21.215 --> 02:26.482
that this person has something
hidden that you have to find.

02:26.553 --> 02:31.650
You check his bags,
but it's his face...

02:31.725 --> 02:35.491
his gestures that
you're really watching.

02:38.432 --> 02:40.457
Thank you.

02:58.485 --> 03:00.919
He's staring straight at you.

03:00.988 --> 03:03.752
Look at him, carefully.

03:03.824 --> 03:06.122
What do you see?

03:06.193 --> 03:10.493
Security 4 to Baggage Claim 17.

03:21.708 --> 03:24.609
- Where you headed?
- Downtown.

03:27.514 --> 03:31.108
- You want to split it?
- S-Sure.

03:43.362 --> 03:47.230
What? Not tonight.
Are you sure?

03:47.300 --> 03:49.598
Well, can't you cancel?

04:01.714 --> 04:06.481
What are these?

04:06.552 --> 04:09.214
Ballet tickets for tonight.

04:12.225 --> 04:17.094
- You don't like ballet?
- Well, some ballets.

04:17.163 --> 04:19.892
Well, that's exactly
what this is: Some ballet.

04:19.966 --> 04:22.901
Look, you can always scalp
the tickets at the door.

04:22.969 --> 04:26.097
You mean,
take these in exchange...

04:26.172 --> 04:30.233
- for you paying your part of the fare.
- Well, what do you think?

04:51.297 --> 04:53.561
- See ya, John.
- Good night, John.

04:53.633 --> 04:55.567
- See you guys.
- See ya.

05:18.324 --> 05:20.918
Christina, here you are.
Hurry and get dressed.

05:20.993 --> 05:23.086
- People are asking for you.
- * Exotica *

05:47.620 --> 05:50.555
- She's right over there. I'll get her.
- * Exotica *

05:50.623 --> 05:52.648
Bye.

05:57.296 --> 05:57.796
Yeah!

06:01.834 --> 06:04.075
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen...

06:04.136 --> 06:06.331
and have a nice,
big round of applause...

06:06.405 --> 06:08.737
for Kali!

06:08.808 --> 06:10.742
Kali.

06:10.810 --> 06:12.744
Yes, indeed. Kali.

06:12.812 --> 06:15.576
And you, too, can-You, too,
can have Kali come over to your table...

06:15.648 --> 06:19.413
for only five dollars, where she can
show you the mysteries of her world.

06:19.484 --> 06:24.148
Trust me, gentlemen. Trust me.

07:10.869 --> 07:13.394
Baby, baby, baby!

07:13.471 --> 07:18.568
Do it for me, baby!

07:18.643 --> 07:24.411
My God, that's incredible.
That's incredible.

07:24.482 --> 07:26.916
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.

07:26.985 --> 07:31.081
What is it that gives a
schoolgirl her special innocence?

07:31.156 --> 07:36.924
Her sweet fragrance? Fresh flowers...
light as a spring rain?

07:36.995 --> 07:39.429
Oh, my God. My God.

07:39.497 --> 07:42.091
Or is it her firm, young flesh
inviting your every caress...

07:42.167 --> 07:44.601
enticing you to explore...

07:44.669 --> 07:49.902
her deepest and most private secrets?

07:49.974 --> 07:55.037
Well, gentlemen, I'm gonna let you
decide that one for yourselves.

07:55.113 --> 07:58.378
Please join me in welcoming a sassy...

07:58.450 --> 08:02.386
bit of jailbait to our stage.

08:02.454 --> 08:06.891
Yes, indeed.

08:06.958 --> 08:09.722
Come out, sweet Chrissy.

08:09.794 --> 08:12.388
Wherever you are, baby,
come on out.

09:28.806 --> 09:33.573
You think you're bad, baby?

09:35.144 --> 09:36.943
You're bad.

09:52.696 --> 09:57.099
That will be $5.50.

10:02.704 --> 10:05.771
Thank you.

11:33.864 --> 11:37.356
- Eric?
- What?

11:37.434 --> 11:41.803
Linda finished her dance.

11:41.872 --> 11:45.638
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen.

11:45.709 --> 11:49.805
Give it up.
Yeah, gentlemen. Yes.

11:49.880 --> 11:55.215
Have a nice, big round
of applause for Linda. Yeah.

11:55.284 --> 11:58.185
Yes, indeed, Linda.

11:58.254 --> 12:00.484
And just a reminder that there is
nothing Linda would love more...

12:00.556 --> 12:02.922
than to slink over to your table and...

12:02.992 --> 12:07.258
give you your own private
show for only five dollars.

12:07.330 --> 12:09.264
That's right.

12:09.332 --> 12:13.393
Five dollars is all it takes to
have one of our beautiful foxes...

12:13.469 --> 12:16.768
come over to your table and
get you all hot and bothered.

12:16.839 --> 12:19.603
But, hey, why be bothered...

12:19.675 --> 12:23.941
when you're being treated like a king?

12:24.013 --> 12:28.609
You've had a rough day.

12:28.684 --> 12:31.915
Don't you think you owe it
to yourselves to...

12:31.988 --> 12:35.822
do something that'll make you
feel like you're someone special?

12:37.893 --> 12:42.227
You are someone special.

12:42.298 --> 12:46.758
Five dollars is all
it takes to prove it.

13:28.010 --> 13:31.377
Yes, let's have a nice big
round of applause for Michelle.

13:31.447 --> 13:34.610
My God, that was beautiful.

13:36.652 --> 13:39.143
Baby, you come out.

13:39.221 --> 13:42.657
And just to remind you that there's
nothing Michelle would love more...

13:42.725 --> 13:45.406
than to come over to your table and
give you your own private dance.

13:47.396 --> 13:50.388
Hello, gentlemen!

13:50.466 --> 13:52.400
Anybody out there?
Anybody alive?

13:52.468 --> 13:55.266
Anybody, for five dollars,
you can have Kali.

13:55.337 --> 13:59.467
Kali at your own private table.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.414
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.

14:06.482 --> 14:08.712
What is it about a schoolgirl...

14:08.784 --> 14:12.242
that gives her that special innocence?

14:15.825 --> 14:18.453
Is it the way that
they can gaze at you...

14:18.527 --> 14:22.588
waiting for you to say something
with so much expectation and hope...

14:22.665 --> 14:27.261
that you're just...
you're just paralyzed into...

14:28.971 --> 14:32.338
into silence?

15:22.223 --> 15:26.717
- Look, I want to give this back to you.
- Why?

15:26.795 --> 15:29.559
Well, you see,
those tickets were given to me...

15:29.631 --> 15:34.398
and I just feel uncomfortable
about having sold them.

15:34.469 --> 15:37.438
- That's okay.
- No, no, no, really, I...

15:41.843 --> 15:44.778
We never really introduced ourselves.
I'm Thomas.

15:44.846 --> 15:46.780
David.

15:46.848 --> 15:49.214
Can I use this
to take you out for a drink?

15:49.284 --> 15:54.153
- That's very kind of you, but...
- But what?

15:54.222 --> 15:58.056
But I really have to get home.

16:38.833 --> 16:41.028
Thanks.

16:41.102 --> 16:43.036
Are you available next Thursday?

16:43.104 --> 16:45.095
- I think so, yeah.
- Good, good.

16:47.508 --> 16:49.874
- Tracey?
- Yeah?

16:49.944 --> 16:52.208
I'm not that boring, am I?

16:52.280 --> 16:56.216
- What do you mean?
- Well, the earphones.

16:56.284 --> 16:58.980
I mean, we used to listen
to the radio...

16:59.053 --> 17:03.012
and you used to ask me
all sorts of questions.

17:03.091 --> 17:05.787
So you want me to ask more questions?

17:07.462 --> 17:11.159
Sure. Yeah, I mean, if there's
something y-you want to know.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.731
Okay. I'll see
what I can think up.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.827
- Say hi to your dad.
- I will.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.839
- Good night.
- Good night.

17:39.326 --> 17:43.194
- Did someone say something?
- No.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.458
So, what's the point?

17:45.532 --> 17:48.865
I've just noticed
a change in your attitude.

17:52.940 --> 17:56.501
Look, I would understand if you would
prefer not to introduce Christina.

17:56.576 --> 18:01.013
I could do it myself.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.413
Actually, I've been thinking
that, perhaps...

18:03.483 --> 18:07.817
I should be getting more involved
in the introductions overall.

18:09.890 --> 18:13.121
I could have my own microphone,
like my mother used to do.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.492
No, I mean, I actually
enjoy introducing Christina.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.191
I mean, I find it
very therapeutic, you know?

18:19.266 --> 18:23.327
- That's not what you're getting paid for.
- Well, it seems to me...

18:23.403 --> 18:27.635
that I'm being paid to make every girl seem
like she's something special, right?

18:27.708 --> 18:32.907
So, in order to do that,
I have to let my imagination run wild.

18:34.982 --> 18:38.543
So, I mean, when it comes
to Christina, I, you know...

18:38.618 --> 18:41.314
My imagination is bound
to run a little wilder.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.118
There's nothing that I can
do to control that, Zoe.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.853
Makes the clients uncomfortable.

18:46.927 --> 18:49.623
And you think your state
puts them at ease?

18:59.373 --> 19:01.307
Hey.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.206
Is he kicking?

19:05.278 --> 19:09.715
All the time.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.114
Do you feel like touching it?

19:36.143 --> 19:40.477
How are you feeling about this?

19:40.547 --> 19:44.074
- Fine.
- Fine?

19:44.151 --> 19:46.779
Are you happy?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.980
For you.

19:51.892 --> 19:55.089
What about you, Eric?
What about you?

19:57.030 --> 19:59.630
Well, I guess I got to be pretty
careful about my feelings, right?

19:59.633 --> 20:02.966
I mean...

20:03.036 --> 20:07.097
that's why we have
a contract, isn't it?

20:12.611 --> 20:15.205
There's plaster dust
all over the apartment.

20:15.281 --> 20:19.115
No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I was
coughing in my sleep last night.

20:19.185 --> 20:22.279
You told me that it was going to be
comfortable for me to live there...

20:22.354 --> 20:24.447
and it is not comfortable.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.457
There's plastic on the furniture.

20:26.525 --> 20:29.619
That is not comfortable living.

20:29.695 --> 20:32.755
Yeah. Oh, come on, look.

20:32.832 --> 20:36.996
You told me you were going to strip the
wallpaper, not strip the walls down.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.004
Well, no, if you'd,
if you'd told me in the first place...

20:40.072 --> 20:42.563
If you'd told me what kind of job it was,
then I would have considered it.

20:42.641 --> 20:46.975
Although, it's-it makes me seem
like you've maybe made a mistake.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.140
That's what it makes me suspect.

20:51.817 --> 20:55.150
What? No, it's too late now.
It's inaccessible.

20:55.221 --> 20:58.190
I'm not gonna pay you. Pay you for what?
You didn't do the job.

20:58.257 --> 21:02.455
Well, you did a job, but it's not
the job that I asked you to do.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.292
It's not the job we agreed on.

21:05.364 --> 21:08.595
Well, I can get anyone,
any number of people to do this.

21:08.667 --> 21:12.660
Yeah, that's just fine with me.

21:16.242 --> 21:19.439
Yeah, can I help you?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.973
- Mr. Pinto?
- Yes.

21:23.048 --> 21:27.849
I'm Francis Brown. We spoke
on the phone a couple of weeks ago.

21:27.920 --> 21:32.448
- Revenue Canada.
- Oh, of course.

21:32.525 --> 21:36.586
- How was your trip?
- It was fine.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.995
- And when did you get back?
- Just yesterday.

21:40.065 --> 21:43.000
Good weather?

21:43.068 --> 21:46.629
Yes, yes, lovely. Yeah.

21:46.705 --> 21:49.538
- Is this a good time, Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, sure.

21:49.608 --> 21:54.102
- It's just that you seem a little...
- A little what?

21:54.180 --> 21:56.774
- Flustered.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.613
I'm fine. I'm fine.

21:59.685 --> 22:01.619
Good.

22:07.293 --> 22:08.311
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:08.312 --> 22:11.127
Listen, I can't talk to you right now.
L-Later.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.775
Okay.

22:42.127 --> 22:45.558
So this is where I'd find
all the bank statements?

22:46.098 --> 22:49.363
Yeah, that's right,
and those there.

22:52.805 --> 22:56.070
Okay. Well, if I have any questions,
I'll let you know.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.169
- Is it a little hot for you back here?
- It's, yeah.

23:00.245 --> 23:04.477
You could turn it down a tad.

23:04.549 --> 23:10.078
I suppose you have to be pretty careful
with the temperature with the animals.

23:10.154 --> 23:12.748
Well, they're a lot hardier
than you'd think.

23:15.493 --> 23:18.428
I wouldn't think they're not hardy.

23:18.496 --> 23:24.264
I mean, just because they're exotic
doesn't mean they can't endure extremes.

23:24.335 --> 23:28.431
It is, after all,
a jungle out there, isn't it?

23:32.076 --> 23:35.341
So, how long will this take?

23:35.413 --> 23:38.576
- An audit?
- Yes.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.813
Well, it depends on
how prepared you are.

23:41.886 --> 23:43.785
Have you got an accountant?

23:43.786 --> 23:46.880
Well, no.
Well, no, not really, no.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.950
Not really?

23:50.028 --> 23:53.555
- So this will take a while?
- I could be done by the end of the day.

23:53.631 --> 23:57.294
Or it might take a week.
It's difficult to say.

23:57.368 --> 24:01.372
Okay. Well,
if you have any questions...

24:01.373 --> 24:02.863
I'll let you know.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.245
Did you know her?

24:43.748 --> 24:46.581
Sort of.

24:46.651 --> 24:50.109
She was your neighbor?

24:50.188 --> 24:53.851
I... I baby-sat her
a couple times.

24:53.925 --> 24:57.884
So you knew her pretty well?

24:57.962 --> 25:01.398
Yeah. I did.

25:01.466 --> 25:03.400
What about you?

25:03.468 --> 25:08.838
I just... I heard this
thing was being organized, so...

25:08.906 --> 25:11.898
It seems so...

25:11.976 --> 25:14.740
surreal, doesn't it?

25:14.812 --> 25:18.248
- What?
- That we'd find anything.

25:18.316 --> 25:23.913
I mean, there's so many places you
could hide something in this country.

25:23.988 --> 25:28.755
- My name's Eric.
- I'm Christina.

25:28.826 --> 25:31.795
Hey, nice to meet you, Christina.

25:45.475 --> 25:48.774
Well?

25:48.845 --> 25:52.406
- Well, what?
- Don't you want to touch it?

25:54.284 --> 25:59.347
You don't have to. It's one of those
things people normally like to do.

26:11.835 --> 26:17.364
What is this thing about Eric calling
you "a sassy piece of jailbait"?

26:17.441 --> 26:21.036
- What's this thing?
- It bothers me.

26:21.111 --> 26:21.952
Why?

26:21.953 --> 26:24.478
It makes you out like
a child or something.

26:24.548 --> 26:29.781
Unlike the tartan skirt and my socks
or the blouse or the way I act, right?

26:32.956 --> 26:37.290
Do you find it strange that he
would still want to work here?

26:37.360 --> 26:42.957
Zoe, not all of us have the luxury of
deciding what to do with our lives.

26:43.033 --> 26:46.127
It's a job, and he's
getting paid all right.

26:46.203 --> 26:48.763
I just find it cruel.

26:48.839 --> 26:51.399
So fire him.

26:53.210 --> 26:56.373
As a favor.

26:56.446 --> 26:59.381
How can you be so detached?

28:36.445 --> 28:39.005
Well, I'm finished for the day.

28:39.081 --> 28:43.279
For the day?
You mean you have to come back?

28:43.352 --> 28:46.219
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

28:46.288 --> 28:48.552
When is a good time?

28:48.624 --> 28:51.104
But, but, I thought you said it
was only going to take one day.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.890
Well, it can only take a day.

28:53.963 --> 28:57.797
But you have to understand, you don't
keep very well-organized books.

28:57.866 --> 29:00.357
That's why you should really think
about getting someone in to help you.

29:00.436 --> 29:03.633
Just somebody to come in
once or twice a week...

29:03.706 --> 29:09.611
depending on the amount of activity
and... the type of activity.

29:09.678 --> 29:12.670
What do you mean by that?

29:12.748 --> 29:15.911
Well, some types of activity are
more complicated, aren't they?

29:15.985 --> 29:18.954
It might take more effort
to account for.

29:21.023 --> 29:24.049
I found a gun in one of the drawers.

29:24.126 --> 29:29.530
- Well, that belonged to my dad.
- Your dad?

29:29.598 --> 29:33.830
Yeah, I guess he just kept it,
just in case.

29:33.902 --> 29:38.669
- In case of what?
- Well, in case of trouble.

29:38.741 --> 29:41.039
With the animals?

29:44.947 --> 29:47.575
Would Monday be a good time
for me to come back...

29:47.650 --> 29:51.142
- Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, yeah.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.245
Well, how about tomorrow?

29:53.322 --> 29:55.143
I have appointments for tomorrow.

29:55.144 --> 29:57.554
Actually, I'm pretty
busy 'til the end of the week.

29:57.626 --> 29:59.685
Monday's not good?

29:59.762 --> 30:02.390
No, Monday's fine.

30:02.464 --> 30:04.830
- Around 10:00?
- Yeah, sure.

30:07.736 --> 30:10.364
Well, good.
Have a nice weekend.

30:39.134 --> 30:42.001
Strange to think that bird is
probably going to outlive us.

30:42.071 --> 30:45.438
Strange?

30:45.507 --> 30:48.738
Did you ever teach it to say anything?

30:48.811 --> 30:50.745
Yes.

30:53.882 --> 30:58.615
- What does it say, Harold?
- It doesn't really say it anymore.

30:58.687 --> 31:00.587
It forgot?

31:02.357 --> 31:07.351
I don't think so.
They're not supposed to forget.

31:07.429 --> 31:10.364
It must have just lost interest.

31:13.368 --> 31:17.099
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. We're just talking about Felix.

31:17.172 --> 31:19.537
What about him?

31:19.607 --> 31:21.939
Dad?

31:22.009 --> 31:26.810
I had the piano tuned.
It sounds beautiful.

31:52.840 --> 31:55.274
So, how does it sound?

31:55.343 --> 31:58.107
- It's good.
- Yeah? Good, good.

31:58.179 --> 32:01.615
- Okay, well, I shouldn't be too late.
- What's "too late"?

32:01.682 --> 32:05.118
- Around 11:00 or so?
- Okay.

32:37.385 --> 32:40.650
You looking for tickets?

32:40.721 --> 32:43.417
Yeah. How much?

33:49.657 --> 33:52.751
That's too hot.

34:14.748 --> 34:18.114
He comes in here every other night.

34:18.685 --> 34:22.451
He has his favorite drink...

34:22.522 --> 34:27.118
at his favorite table
with his favorite dancer.

34:28.862 --> 34:34.630
Sometimes he has to wait for her,
and sometimes she's waiting for him.

34:34.701 --> 34:39.138
She'll protect him.
She's his angel.

34:45.645 --> 34:49.741
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time at the Exotica.

34:49.815 --> 34:52.409
And just to remind you that
five dollars is all it takes...

34:52.485 --> 34:57.081
to have one of our lovely ladies
come over to your table...

34:57.157 --> 35:02.094
and show you the mysteries
of their world.

36:16.002 --> 36:20.405
Now if that didn't turn you
on, gentlemen, nothing will.

36:20.473 --> 36:26.105
Let's have a nice, big, warm round
of applause for Christina, gentlemen!

36:26.179 --> 36:28.579
Yes, Christina!

36:50.804 --> 36:54.899
What are you thinking?

36:54.973 --> 36:59.410
I was just thinking,
what would happen if someone hurt you?

37:02.815 --> 37:07.081
H-How could anyone hurt me?

37:07.152 --> 37:12.249
If I'm not there to protect you.

37:14.660 --> 37:20.121
I- You'll always be there to protect me.

37:47.960 --> 37:51.054
An angel.

37:58.804 --> 38:03.070
Why would somebody want
to do something like that?

38:04.810 --> 38:10.248
How could somebody even think
of doing something like that?

38:10.315 --> 38:14.251
You mustn't worry.

38:30.002 --> 38:33.096
Eric! Eric!

38:35.507 --> 38:41.241
All hot and bothered, yes, indeed.

38:41.313 --> 38:46.774
Let's have a nice, big
round of applause for Melinda.

39:40.838 --> 39:45.275
Listen, I feel bad about,
taking your money.

39:45.343 --> 39:49.780
- Why?
- The tickets were given to me, and...

39:49.847 --> 39:52.782
I should have given them away for free.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.944
- Well, that would have been stupid.
- Why?

39:56.020 --> 39:58.784
Because no one gives anything away.

40:00.358 --> 40:04.226
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, p-positive.

40:27.885 --> 40:31.821
Do you consider my dad a friend?

40:31.889 --> 40:35.256
- Why?
- J-Just asking.

40:35.326 --> 40:38.159
Does he consider me a friend?

40:38.229 --> 40:41.164
I don't know.

40:41.232 --> 40:43.325
Why not?

40:43.401 --> 40:47.269
'Cause he always seems
different when you're around.

40:47.338 --> 40:51.672
- Different in what way?
- J-Tense.

40:54.011 --> 40:55.945
Is that bad?

40:56.013 --> 41:00.279
Well, I don't really like to
feel tense around my friends.

41:00.351 --> 41:02.615
Well, sure, yeah.

41:02.687 --> 41:05.918
I didn't like to feel tense around my
friends when I was your age either.

41:05.990 --> 41:09.289
But you do now?

41:09.360 --> 41:12.921
No, it's not a question
of liking it or not.

41:12.997 --> 41:16.626
It's just something that happens.

41:16.701 --> 41:18.965
Why?

41:25.209 --> 41:29.805
Well... as you get older...

41:29.880 --> 41:34.817
you become aware that the people
you meet and the person you are...

41:34.885 --> 41:39.083
as carrying
a certain amount of baggage.

41:39.156 --> 41:43.820
And, and that baggage creates tension.

41:43.894 --> 41:47.261
So what do you do about it?

41:47.331 --> 41:49.959
Well, you can pretend it's not there...

41:50.034 --> 41:53.765
or you can choose not to have friends...

41:53.838 --> 41:58.172
or you can acknowledge that it's
there and have friends anyway.

41:58.242 --> 42:00.608
Like my dad?

42:02.113 --> 42:04.445
Right.

42:04.515 --> 42:08.747
I don't think that I like
my dad when he's around you.

42:15.025 --> 42:17.118
Well, that's...

42:17.194 --> 42:21.790
because your dad doesn't like
himself when he's around me.

42:21.866 --> 42:23.800
But that's okay.

42:23.868 --> 42:27.735
That's... part of what
friends do to each other.

42:32.375 --> 42:34.468
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:02.238 --> 43:04.263
I... I just graduated.

43:04.340 --> 43:06.274
Really? So did I.

43:06.342 --> 43:10.278
- Oh, yeah? In what?
- Radio communications.

43:10.346 --> 43:13.941
- So, so is that what you do?
- That's what I'd like to do.

43:14.017 --> 43:17.282
I do a little
freelance deejay stuff...

43:17.353 --> 43:20.447
but, you know, right now
I'm just driving a cab.

43:20.523 --> 43:23.332
I thought you might
do something like that.

43:23.333 --> 43:24.289
Drive a cab?

43:24.360 --> 43:28.062
No, do something
where, you use your voice.

43:28.063 --> 43:29.297
Why?

43:29.365 --> 43:34.234
I don't know why.
Because you're easy to listen to.

43:34.304 --> 43:37.796
Because of my voice?

43:56.326 --> 44:00.422
I just need to find
a structure, you know?

44:00.497 --> 44:02.431
What do you mean?

44:02.499 --> 44:07.095
Listen, I waste so much time, you know?
I just-My days just slip by, you know?

44:07.170 --> 44:11.300
- Isn't that what days are supposed to do?
- Yeah.

44:11.374 --> 44:14.775
Not if you want to make
something of yourself, you know?

44:14.844 --> 44:18.940
What do you want to make of yourself?

44:19.015 --> 44:23.452
I don't know. I just feel that I was
meant to do something with my time.

44:23.520 --> 44:28.287
I mean, otherwise, I wouldn't be
thinking of this this way.

44:28.358 --> 44:32.624
I'd be able to just continue
what I was doing, you know?

44:39.869 --> 44:44.636
Do you have a lot of friends?

44:46.442 --> 44:50.378
Not really. Do you?

44:50.446 --> 44:53.745
- No.
- Yeah.

44:53.816 --> 44:59.049
Do you ever feel like you need a friend?

44:59.122 --> 45:02.580
Yeah, sometimes.

45:02.659 --> 45:05.719
When?

45:05.795 --> 45:08.389
Like right now.

45:08.464 --> 45:11.228
Why?

45:11.301 --> 45:14.394
'Cause I just met you and...

45:14.469 --> 45:17.905
I just feel like
telling someone, you know?

45:58.113 --> 46:02.209
No way. No way, no way.

46:04.953 --> 46:07.046
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:07.122 --> 46:10.216
- Jesus.
- What's the matter?

46:10.292 --> 46:13.523
"What's the matter?"
Her wigs, her clothes.

46:13.595 --> 46:17.725
Sometimes I just feel like
throwing them all away, you know?

46:17.799 --> 46:19.892
What are you looking for, Zoe?

46:25.474 --> 46:28.238
- I mean, is this where you see your future?
- My future?

46:30.312 --> 46:32.246
The club?

46:34.916 --> 46:40.411
When Mom died, my immediate idea was
to get rid of this place. Just sell it.

46:40.489 --> 46:44.363
I never thought it would
have any interest for me.

46:44.364 --> 46:45.654
So why did it?

46:51.767 --> 46:54.531
I used to be very shy as a child.

46:54.603 --> 46:57.197
I used to watch my mother for hours...

46:57.272 --> 47:01.038
just admiring her sense of freedom.

47:02.778 --> 47:06.646
So when the opportunity came up,
I thought I would take on the challenge.

47:06.715 --> 47:11.584
So you feel better about adopting her
options rather than creating your own?

47:13.455 --> 47:15.616
I have created my own options too.

47:15.691 --> 47:18.057
I know.

47:26.668 --> 47:30.331
It's your contract
for the baby with Eric.

47:30.405 --> 47:32.771
I found it.

47:32.841 --> 47:35.901
Does he know?

47:35.977 --> 47:38.343
I would hope so.

47:38.413 --> 47:43.350
Otherwise he might just think I'm disgusted
with him for no particular reason.

47:45.587 --> 47:48.920
Look, I really desperately
needed this child...

47:48.990 --> 47:52.016
and it just worked out with Eric.

47:52.094 --> 47:54.722
I didn't mean to hurt you.

47:54.796 --> 47:58.425
You know, I remember when your
mother built this hallway.

47:58.500 --> 48:03.732
She... she built it for this very
rich man who used to come here.

48:06.040 --> 48:09.532
He used to get off watching us dance for
other guys, so he actually paid her...

48:09.610 --> 48:13.137
to construct this very special
place that he could watch us from.

48:14.915 --> 48:17.145
Your mother never told us that.

48:17.218 --> 48:19.812
She said it was to protect us...

48:19.887 --> 48:22.822
so she could patrol things.

48:26.093 --> 48:28.220
And I believed her.

48:29.797 --> 48:32.391
Until Eric told me the truth.

48:35.336 --> 48:37.270
Why did you believe him?

48:37.338 --> 48:39.738
I made a choice.

48:42.743 --> 48:47.339
And Eric promised me
he'd never lie to me.

49:29.290 --> 49:32.748
How could anyone...

49:32.827 --> 49:35.261
hurt you?

49:39.800 --> 49:42.735
Take you away from me?

49:47.675 --> 49:50.303
How could anyone?

50:38.158 --> 50:41.127
What's this machine?

50:41.195 --> 50:44.130
It's an incubator.

50:44.198 --> 50:48.964
- Wh-What's it for?
- Well, what do you think it's for?

50:49.035 --> 50:51.560
- Eggs.
- That's right.

50:51.638 --> 50:54.698
Are they yours?

50:54.774 --> 50:57.368
Wh-What do you mean?

50:57.443 --> 51:01.188
I mean, shouldn't you be
sitting on them or something?

51:01.189 --> 51:02.005
Oh, yeah.

51:02.081 --> 51:05.380
Well, I guess I've abandoned the nest.

51:14.794 --> 51:19.891
What's inside of them?

51:19.966 --> 51:24.062
- The eggs?
- Yes.

51:24.137 --> 51:26.731
Well, Hyacinth Macaws...

51:26.806 --> 51:29.673
if you want to know the absolute truth.

51:29.742 --> 51:32.336
And where did you get them?

51:32.412 --> 51:38.180
From... very far away.

51:53.266 --> 51:56.360
Hey, check her out?

51:59.272 --> 52:02.469
I said check her out.

52:02.542 --> 52:06.706
- Yeah.
- You talking to me?

52:06.779 --> 52:10.715
Yes, I'm talking to you.

52:12.785 --> 52:15.049
What? Check who out?

52:15.121 --> 52:17.817
The babe that's dancing for you, man.

52:17.890 --> 52:22.054
You've given her quite a run
for your money, man.

52:22.128 --> 52:24.892
What do you mean by that?

52:24.964 --> 52:28.991
- She's been dancing for you all night.
- Yeah.

52:29.068 --> 52:33.061
Yeah, and not just tonight. I mean, I've
noticed you with her other nights too.

52:36.075 --> 52:39.602
You come in here all the time or...

52:39.679 --> 52:44.343
Yeah. All the time.

52:44.417 --> 52:49.013
This-Visuals, you know?
It's good.

52:49.088 --> 52:52.353
But...

52:52.425 --> 52:57.260
she seems to have a bit of a
thing for you, doesn't she?

52:59.098 --> 53:02.659
We... get along.

53:02.735 --> 53:06.865
I'm sure you do, my friend.

53:06.939 --> 53:10.705
What do you two talk about?

53:10.777 --> 53:16.374
Just... the usual, I guess.

53:16.449 --> 53:18.383
The usual?

53:18.451 --> 53:23.388
I don't think you're talking
about what I would call "usual."

53:23.456 --> 53:26.220
- Why not?
- Because I can tell.

53:26.292 --> 53:29.819
You get pretty intense,
my friend.

53:29.896 --> 53:32.421
Well, I guess that's just the way I am.

53:36.068 --> 53:41.335
So, Hey, why don't you
give her a little touch?

53:41.406 --> 53:47.174
- You're not supposed to touch.
- But she is into it, believe me.

53:47.245 --> 53:50.510
Yeah.

53:50.582 --> 53:56.020
- How do you know?
- Everybody knows, man.

53:56.088 --> 53:58.818
Trust me, my friend.

53:58.890 --> 54:02.849
Trust me. Just a little touch.

54:02.928 --> 54:07.024
Nothing too drastic.

54:07.099 --> 54:11.365
Then you will get
the full experience, my friend...

54:11.436 --> 54:13.996
and you will love it.

54:14.072 --> 54:18.532
You will love it. Okay?

54:18.610 --> 54:23.274
And what happens when I touch her?

54:23.348 --> 54:27.876
What happens?

55:03.421 --> 55:07.118
You're outta here, man!
Get out!

55:10.428 --> 55:13.192
Come on. Get down there.

55:13.265 --> 55:15.927
Come on. Go.

55:31.685 --> 55:34.278
Hey, what the hell you doin'?
Get off the road!

55:39.525 --> 55:42.688
Move!

56:02.715 --> 56:04.980
What's so funny?

56:05.050 --> 56:08.144
It's like pettin' a gorilla.

56:08.220 --> 56:10.985
Well...

56:11.056 --> 56:13.992
Was your father this hairy?

56:14.059 --> 56:18.156
No, I... I got it
from my mother.

56:18.230 --> 56:20.664
I mean, I mean,
from my mother's side of the family.

56:20.732 --> 56:26.500
That's where you
inherit hair patterns.

56:26.571 --> 56:31.441
- My uncle's bald.
- On your mother's side?

56:34.013 --> 56:37.778
Well, I guess I'm talking
about usual patterns.

56:37.849 --> 56:42.287
There's always exceptions.

56:42.354 --> 56:44.947
That's...

56:45.024 --> 56:50.462
That's the way these things... work.

57:01.373 --> 57:04.206
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

57:04.275 --> 57:07.301
No, I'm fine.

57:07.379 --> 57:11.314
You don't look fine.

57:11.382 --> 57:14.682
You worry about me, don't you?

57:14.753 --> 57:18.813
You think this is normal?

57:18.891 --> 57:23.123
- What?
- What we do.

57:25.563 --> 57:27.929
What do we do?

57:30.001 --> 57:32.834
That's just it.
We don't speak about it.

57:32.905 --> 57:38.775
You know that feeling
you get sometimes, Tracey...

57:38.843 --> 57:42.074
that you didn't ask to be
brought into the world?

57:43.848 --> 57:45.782
Yeah.

57:47.686 --> 57:49.881
Well, then who did?

57:49.955 --> 57:52.115
What?

57:52.191 --> 57:54.556
If you think that you didn't ask...

57:54.627 --> 57:58.562
to be brought into the world...

57:58.631 --> 58:01.191
then who did?

58:15.347 --> 58:20.478
All I'm saying is nobody asked you if
you wanted to be brought into the world.

58:20.551 --> 58:23.988
You just ended up getting here.

58:26.057 --> 58:30.085
So the question is,
now that you're here...

58:30.162 --> 58:34.098
who's asking you to stay?

58:44.676 --> 58:47.611
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

58:47.680 --> 58:50.978
Look, are you sure you're gonna be okay?

58:51.050 --> 58:53.950
Yes.

58:54.019 --> 58:56.009
Good night.

59:01.193 --> 59:03.127
Good night.

59:11.936 --> 59:13.960
- He touched you?
- He didn't want to.

59:14.037 --> 59:17.030
- What do you mean?
- I know him.

59:17.108 --> 59:22.102
- We all know him. He's crazy about you.
- Not like that.

59:22.180 --> 59:24.381
Why didn't you get one of the
boys to handle this, Eric?

59:24.414 --> 59:27.645
Because I didn't think of it.

59:27.718 --> 59:30.186
I just saw him touch her, and...

59:30.253 --> 59:32.245
Why didn't you ask him to leave?

59:32.323 --> 59:34.518
- Because he wouldn't have listened.
- How do you know that?

59:34.591 --> 59:37.584
Because he's in his own world,
the ass-wipe.

59:37.662 --> 59:39.857
I don't know where
you're both coming from.

59:39.930 --> 59:44.265
You are telling me that he touched you,
but he really didn't.

59:44.335 --> 59:47.862
And you're saying that you overreacted,
but you didn't have a choice?

59:47.938 --> 59:51.705
- I didn't.
- Why not?

59:51.775 --> 59:57.237
Why not?
Because he touched you.

59:57.314 --> 01:00:00.614
Okay.

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:03.313
All I'm concerned about
is if he makes a case...

01:00:03.386 --> 01:00:07.117
I have to know what happened.

01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:09.249
We told you what happened, Zoe.

01:00:09.326 --> 01:00:12.455
And that is what happened?

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:21.160
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:00:21.239 --> 01:00:24.105
Is that it?

01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:29.136
Hi. This is Thomas.

01:00:29.212 --> 01:00:31.477
I am not in at the present time,
but I am in town.

01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:36.316
Please leave a message
following the beep.

01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:38.479
Good morning.

01:00:38.556 --> 01:00:42.992
You're probably not up yet,
so you haven't seen what I've done.

01:00:43.059 --> 01:00:46.655
I'm a customs officer at the airport.

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:51.828
Actually, I saw you the other day when
you were having your bags inspected.

01:00:51.902 --> 01:00:55.838
I know-I know how you probably
smuggled those eggs in.

01:00:55.907 --> 01:01:00.674
There's a special unit at work. I think
they give them to the zoo or something.

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:05.681
They asked me where I got them.
I had to lie.

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:07.684
Where are they?

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:10.345
- I took them.
- Where?

01:01:10.421 --> 01:01:13.355
- I'd like to see you again.
- Oh, no.

01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:16.222
No, they're in the country now.
They're definitely in the country.

01:01:16.294 --> 01:01:18.626
It's just I don't have
them with me presently,

01:01:18.627 --> 01:01:20.196
but it doesn't mean I can't get them.

01:01:20.263 --> 01:01:23.528
And if you can give me, like...
just a couple...

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.695
- Good morning.
- Hi. And I'm here. Okay.

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:29.797
So I'll call...
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

01:01:29.874 --> 01:01:32.308
You look like you're
in worse shape than I am.

01:01:32.376 --> 01:01:35.470
What happened to you?

01:01:35.546 --> 01:01:38.309
I fell down some stairs and...

01:01:38.381 --> 01:01:41.977
- Are you okay?
- Well, do I look okay?

01:01:42.052 --> 01:01:43.133
No, not really.

01:01:43.134 --> 01:01:46.489
Well, I'm better than I look.
Here, I got you a coffee.

01:01:46.556 --> 01:01:49.321
I didn't...
I didn't know how you took it.

01:01:49.393 --> 01:01:51.657
Black's fine.

01:01:51.729 --> 01:01:54.822
- I added cream.
- That's okay.

01:01:54.897 --> 01:01:58.663
- No, here, have mine. No, I insist.
- No, really...

01:02:02.238 --> 01:02:04.332
What is it?

01:02:04.406 --> 01:02:08.502
Well, it's just that
this has cream in it too.

01:02:08.577 --> 01:02:11.171
It's milk.

01:02:11.248 --> 01:02:14.012
Good.

01:02:14.084 --> 01:02:16.017
Okay, well, I'll...

01:02:16.086 --> 01:02:19.021
I'll get to work.

01:03:03.399 --> 01:03:05.993
What?

01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:08.502
What is it?

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:13.166
What is it that gives a
schoolgirl her special innocence?

01:03:14.911 --> 01:03:18.846
Is it the way they smell?

01:03:18.914 --> 01:03:23.851
The sweet smell
of their perfume, of their hair?

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.413
The aroma of fresh flowers...

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:30.459
and all that other stuff
that hasn't been fucked up...

01:03:30.526 --> 01:03:33.962
by late nights and a lot of bad food.

01:03:36.865 --> 01:03:42.634
Is it their gestures...
and the way they move?

01:03:42.706 --> 01:03:47.803
The way their body still holds on to
some semblance of self-respect and...

01:03:47.877 --> 01:03:51.642
and dignity?

01:03:51.714 --> 01:03:55.981
When they wrap their
beautiful legs around you...

01:03:56.051 --> 01:03:59.988
tight and holding on,
looking at you...

01:04:00.055 --> 01:04:01.989
you looking at them.

01:04:02.057 --> 01:04:05.323
It's just...

01:04:05.395 --> 01:04:08.158
Or is it whatever comes out
of their cute little mouths?

01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:11.666
All those questions,
all that wondering that...

01:04:16.739 --> 01:04:18.372
It's just, you know, you...

01:04:18.373 --> 01:04:21.335
They got their whole lives
ahead of them, you know?

01:04:21.411 --> 01:04:24.847
And you've wasted half of yours away.

01:04:24.914 --> 01:04:26.848
Damn.

01:04:28.584 --> 01:04:30.677
What is it?

01:04:33.189 --> 01:04:36.282
There's this feeling
I get sometimes, you know?

01:04:36.358 --> 01:04:38.953
What sort of feeling?

01:04:39.028 --> 01:04:43.964
That I wasn't ever meant
to be satisfied.

01:04:44.032 --> 01:04:47.126
Satisfied with what?

01:04:47.202 --> 01:04:49.636
A lot of things.

01:04:49.704 --> 01:04:52.139
I mean, it seems to me that
every time I'm about to...

01:04:52.207 --> 01:04:56.644
you know, get a hold
of something or someone...

01:04:56.712 --> 01:05:01.978
it's just bound to slip away.

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:04.645
Maybe you want it to slip away.

01:05:04.719 --> 01:05:07.984
Maybe I want what to slip away?

01:05:08.056 --> 01:05:13.154
The things that you think
you're about to have.

01:05:13.227 --> 01:05:16.993
What would you think about that?

01:05:17.065 --> 01:05:20.160
As a general philosophy...

01:05:20.234 --> 01:05:22.498
or how it pertains to you?

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:25.665
You think you could talk
about how it pertains to me?

01:05:25.741 --> 01:05:28.174
What do you mean?

01:05:28.242 --> 01:05:32.270
Well, I feel like I want you.

01:05:32.347 --> 01:05:37.444
Do you think that means
you'll slip away?

01:05:43.192 --> 01:05:45.887
Dad?

01:05:45.961 --> 01:05:50.727
I'm not going to baby-sit
for Uncle Francis anymore.

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:53.962
Baby-sit?
You go there to practice.

01:05:54.035 --> 01:05:57.300
That's absurd.

01:05:57.372 --> 01:05:59.771
Why?

01:05:59.842 --> 01:06:05.144
Dad, he pretends I'm still
baby-sitting for him.

01:06:05.213 --> 01:06:07.647
Why would you think that?

01:06:07.716 --> 01:06:09.684
Because he's paying me.

01:06:09.751 --> 01:06:12.617
To house-sit.

01:06:16.391 --> 01:06:18.950
Twenty dollars an hour?

01:06:19.026 --> 01:06:22.428
When did it go up?

01:06:22.497 --> 01:06:25.330
He wants to believe
that Lisa's still there.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.459
I make it easier for him
to convince himself.

01:06:31.173 --> 01:06:35.609
Francis always had strange
ways to convince himself...

01:06:35.676 --> 01:06:38.612
of many things.

01:06:38.679 --> 01:06:44.448
Things that never happened,
things that might happen.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:50.117
People who did things
for reasons, but they didn't.

01:06:52.194 --> 01:06:56.631
What has any of this
got to do with me, Dad?

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:03.136
Nothing.

01:07:03.204 --> 01:07:06.299
Nothing at all.

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:10.310
So why do I have to keep going there?

01:07:10.378 --> 01:07:12.642
You don't.

01:07:12.713 --> 01:07:15.147
And you'll tell him?

01:07:20.021 --> 01:07:24.482
I was in here the other night
when that guy was thrown out.

01:07:24.559 --> 01:07:29.257
Why did that happen?
Has he ever been thrown out before?

01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:33.425
- Why do you think he would touch you?
- Why do you think he would touch you?

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.595
Why do you think he would touch you?

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:40.265
Well, what do you think was
going through his mind when he...

01:07:40.341 --> 01:07:43.936
Or-Or what was he thinking?

01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:46.605
- Well...
- What's so funny?

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.615
Well, this is a joke, right?

01:07:48.683 --> 01:07:50.947
Not at all.

01:07:51.018 --> 01:07:55.750
If you do this favor for me,
I'll do that favor for you.

01:07:58.858 --> 01:08:01.520
But I'm not hiding anything.

01:08:01.596 --> 01:08:05.895
Thomas, you're hiding
a smuggling operation...

01:08:05.967 --> 01:08:10.961
that brings in over $200,000 a year,
probably a lot more.

01:08:11.038 --> 01:08:13.063
We've suspected you for a long time.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:16.631
I was just brought in to
confirm what was already known.

01:08:16.711 --> 01:08:19.202
So how do you want me to report back?

01:08:23.049 --> 01:08:26.712
All I'm asking for is a bit of help.

01:08:26.787 --> 01:08:29.346
That's all.

01:08:29.423 --> 01:08:33.984
It's very important for me to know these
things. Just ask her these questions.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:38.327
Do this for me,
and you have a clean slate.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:44.201
This really hasn't been my day.

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:48.707
So change things.
Make it your day.

01:08:50.845 --> 01:08:53.279
And all you men sitting
near that stage, I can see you.

01:08:53.346 --> 01:08:55.439
I know what you're thinking.

01:08:55.515 --> 01:08:58.779
You're thinking that "because I'm
sitting next to that stage..."

01:08:58.852 --> 01:09:01.616
I'm getting the same feeling
as all those guys...

01:09:01.688 --> 01:09:05.625
"shoveling out that cash for
their own private dancer."

01:09:05.693 --> 01:09:09.788
Well, you know, you guys want
to watch, go to the movies.

01:09:09.863 --> 01:09:12.627
We're in the live-action
business here, gents.

01:09:12.698 --> 01:09:14.124
And, okay, granted...

01:09:14.125 --> 01:09:18.466
Granted, that beautiful creature
writhing before you on stage...

01:09:18.538 --> 01:09:21.631
she maybe, you know,
smiles at you.

01:09:21.707 --> 01:09:23.643
She winks her eyes at you
occasionally...

01:09:23.711 --> 01:09:25.975
and you may feel like the man.

01:09:26.046 --> 01:09:28.037
Is that all you guys are looking for?

01:09:28.115 --> 01:09:32.073
Is that all you want?
Come on, come on.

01:09:32.153 --> 01:09:36.087
Invite one of our lovely ladies over
to your table where the real action is.

01:09:36.156 --> 01:09:38.750
- Yeah!
- Hi.

01:09:38.826 --> 01:09:41.419
I'm really sorry that took so long,
or I took so long.

01:09:41.495 --> 01:09:43.587
- Hi.
- It's such a busy night.

01:09:43.663 --> 01:09:46.598
Hi. I'm Chrissy.

01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:49.430
Hi. I'm Thomas.

01:09:49.502 --> 01:09:53.939
It's nice to meet you, Thomas.
I like the name Thomas a lot.

01:09:54.006 --> 01:09:55.942
Oh, thanks.

01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:58.102
Are you from out of town?

01:09:58.178 --> 01:10:00.112
Yes.

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.444
Where are you from?

01:10:02.515 --> 01:10:06.611
San Francisco.

01:10:06.687 --> 01:10:09.451
You're kidding.
I love San Francisco.

01:10:09.523 --> 01:10:12.116
You've-You've been there?

01:10:12.193 --> 01:10:17.459
Yeah, I was there a couple of
years ago with my debating team.

01:10:17.529 --> 01:10:19.623
Debating team?

01:10:19.698 --> 01:10:23.465
That's-I admire
someone who can debate well.

01:10:23.536 --> 01:10:26.629
I mean, who can debate
instead of just argue.

01:10:26.706 --> 01:10:31.143
Well, anyone can argue, but it's
a good skill, discipline...

01:10:31.211 --> 01:10:33.975
to be able to debate and stand back.

01:10:34.047 --> 01:10:37.312
And that's something you
can apply in your life...

01:10:37.384 --> 01:10:39.648
outside of school.

01:10:39.719 --> 01:10:42.653
And, and when you're meeting
someone or negotiating.

01:10:42.721 --> 01:10:43.580
Negotiating?

01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:47.158
Well, I mean, if you have...
If you have to...

01:10:47.226 --> 01:10:52.163
It's a good skill to learn,
as opposed to cheerleading or...

01:10:52.231 --> 01:10:54.166
Well, that's what I say.

01:10:54.234 --> 01:10:56.668
Don't be nervous about this, Thomas.

01:10:56.735 --> 01:11:00.172
- We're gonna have some fun, okay?
- Sure.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.834
Sure.

01:11:20.092 --> 01:11:24.359
I was here the other night...

01:11:24.431 --> 01:11:26.365
What night was that?

01:11:26.432 --> 01:11:29.629
The night th-that guy was thrown out.

01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:31.966
You were dancing for him.

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:34.972
His name is Francis.

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:37.566
What happened?

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:45.149
He was a bad boy.

01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:50.086
- Wh-What do you mean by that?
- What do I mean?

01:11:50.155 --> 01:11:53.182
I mean, have you danced
for him before a lot?

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.389
- And has he ever been thrown out before?
- No.

01:11:58.465 --> 01:12:00.625
So what do you think happened?

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:03.827
He touched me.

01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:06.837
And when you're dancing
for the customer...

01:12:06.905 --> 01:12:09.669
they can't touch.

01:12:09.741 --> 01:12:12.575
Yes, but why do you think
he touched you last night?

01:12:12.644 --> 01:12:15.374
Has he ever touched you before?

01:12:15.447 --> 01:12:18.508
Is this what you really want to talk
about for five bucks a dance, Thomas?

01:12:18.585 --> 01:12:22.783
Well, I just want to know what you
think was going on in his mind.

01:12:22.855 --> 01:12:26.222
Are you here for some kind
of psychology conference?

01:12:26.292 --> 01:12:30.125
Well, yes.

01:12:30.196 --> 01:12:32.960
I am, actually.

01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:35.967
He's...

01:12:36.035 --> 01:12:39.299
He's a very particular case.

01:12:39.372 --> 01:12:42.636
Particular in what way?

01:12:45.377 --> 01:12:49.644
You want the full story?

01:12:49.715 --> 01:12:50.215
Sure.

01:12:58.724 --> 01:13:01.692
His daughter was murdered
a couple of years ago...

01:13:01.759 --> 01:13:05.321
and then he was implicated.

01:13:05.396 --> 01:13:07.990
- For th-the murder?
- Yeah.

01:13:08.066 --> 01:13:10.360
- But why?
- I don't know.

01:13:10.361 --> 01:13:13.333
I don't really remember the details.

01:13:13.404 --> 01:13:16.498
I mean, he was cleared, and then
they caught the guy who did it.

01:13:16.575 --> 01:13:20.841
But... it obviously had, like, this...

01:13:20.912 --> 01:13:22.846
this incredible effect on him.

01:13:22.914 --> 01:13:26.180
I mean, he is...

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:30.277
He's just so fucked up about it.

01:13:34.526 --> 01:13:38.622
You know...

01:13:38.697 --> 01:13:41.632
Thomas...

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:46.364
Francis and I have a very
special type of relationship.

01:13:46.438 --> 01:13:49.634
And I've never-I've never minded.

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:53.143
But then he chose to violate it.

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:55.975
S-Special in what way?

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.487
Well, we've, we've always
had this understanding.

01:14:06.557 --> 01:14:09.652
I mean, I need him
for certain things...

01:14:09.728 --> 01:14:12.662
and... he needs me for certain things.

01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:15.164
I mean,
that's the way it's been.

01:14:15.232 --> 01:14:18.498
And how did he violate that?

01:14:18.569 --> 01:14:24.337
He-He violated that in his-his, in his
role and what he was supposed to do for me.

01:14:24.409 --> 01:14:26.900
Wh-What's he su-Why?

01:14:26.979 --> 01:14:30.210
What's he supposed to do for you? I
mean, he comes to this club. He pays you.

01:14:30.281 --> 01:14:34.115
Because I was doing things for him...

01:14:34.185 --> 01:14:37.178
and he's done things for me.

01:14:40.525 --> 01:14:43.789
What has he done for you?

01:14:43.862 --> 01:14:46.796
I'm...

01:14:46.864 --> 01:14:50.300
I'm sorry.

01:14:50.368 --> 01:14:55.431
Okay, this is really stupid.

01:14:55.507 --> 01:15:01.308
And then I'm getting so emotional
over the fact that he touched me...

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:05.645
because, I mean, he was,
he was always paying me...

01:15:05.717 --> 01:15:08.810
to do him this favor and...

01:15:08.886 --> 01:15:10.821
- What favor?
- I don't know, Thomas.

01:15:10.889 --> 01:15:14.825
- Why do you want to know all this?
- Well, I'm sorry, but I...

01:15:14.893 --> 01:15:19.386
What is it about a schoolgirl that gives
her that special innocence, gentlemen?

01:15:19.463 --> 01:15:23.490
Such a thing that you have
absolutely no control over.

01:15:23.567 --> 01:15:27.162
You never have.

01:15:27.239 --> 01:15:31.335
And you never will.

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:33.541
After this break, we'll be
right back with sweet Chrissy...

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:34.606
He's not supposed to do that.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.614
- Who'll help us answer that question.
- Do what?

01:15:36.681 --> 01:15:38.615
He's not supposed to...
He's not suppose...

01:15:38.683 --> 01:15:41.448
He can obviously see from his booth that
I'm sitting here talking with a client.

01:15:41.519 --> 01:15:44.284
He's not supposed to call me
when I'm talking with a client.

01:15:44.355 --> 01:15:48.290
Why? Do you have to go now?

01:15:49.693 --> 01:15:51.628
Yeah.

01:15:51.696 --> 01:15:55.792
But I want to come back,
and I want to, you know, talk.

01:15:55.865 --> 01:15:59.802
But I want to move downstairs.
I don't like it here.

01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:01.804
Sure, sure, sure.

01:16:01.872 --> 01:16:05.068
Okay. I'll see you soon.

01:16:11.882 --> 01:16:17.218
I'm going to move to the washroom.

01:16:45.181 --> 01:16:50.119
Hey, I've noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with that lady.

01:16:50.187 --> 01:16:52.621
Are you-Are you talking to me?

01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:54.953
Yeah.

01:16:55.025 --> 01:16:59.359
You seem to... to both
hit it off together.

01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:01.955
- Well, I guess.
- Yeah.

01:17:02.032 --> 01:17:04.192
I guess that can happen.

01:17:04.267 --> 01:17:08.466
So what do you guys talk about?

01:17:08.538 --> 01:17:11.975
Just things.

01:17:12.042 --> 01:17:15.807
What sort of things?

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.814
Oh, this and that.

01:17:17.882 --> 01:17:20.213
"This and that"?

01:17:20.284 --> 01:17:24.311
You know, it's amazing how...

01:17:24.388 --> 01:17:28.915
you can hit it off with
someone like that, isn't it?

01:17:33.497 --> 01:17:37.593
Have you ever noticed that some
people just drift into your life...

01:17:37.668 --> 01:17:41.468
like you've known them forever?

01:17:41.538 --> 01:17:44.440
I mean, there are some people
that you can remember...

01:17:44.507 --> 01:17:49.275
the moment that you met them
really clearly.

01:17:49.345 --> 01:17:52.440
And other people that...

01:17:52.516 --> 01:17:58.284
it seems like you've known them forever,
even though you haven't.

01:17:58.354 --> 01:18:03.122
And they all become part of this
continuous memory you have of yourself.

01:18:03.193 --> 01:18:06.959
This ongoing...

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:08.965
Are you with me?

01:18:09.033 --> 01:18:12.628
Yeah, I think so.

01:18:12.702 --> 01:18:14.636
I mean, here you are,
y-you know...

01:18:14.705 --> 01:18:16.969
you're having this beautiful
conversation with her.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:22.138
You're getting to know each other, and...

01:18:22.212 --> 01:18:26.478
I mean, there's other guys
that come in here.

01:18:26.549 --> 01:18:30.418
There's this one guy who comes in here
every other night or something...

01:18:30.487 --> 01:18:34.583
and he spends a few hours with her.

01:18:34.658 --> 01:18:37.091
But he never really
gets to know her, you know?

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:41.596
Not the way you have.
Not the way you two...

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.596
She really seems to be herself with you.

01:18:52.007 --> 01:18:54.942
Well, how do you know?

01:18:57.013 --> 01:18:59.776
What? That she's being herself?

01:18:59.849 --> 01:19:02.942
Yeah.

01:19:03.018 --> 01:19:07.956
Because I used to be her lover.

01:19:08.024 --> 01:19:11.789
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't let you in.

01:19:11.861 --> 01:19:14.294
Look, why not?

01:19:15.864 --> 01:19:19.459
Look, can I... Can I at least
just talk to the manager?

01:19:19.535 --> 01:19:23.733
- You want to talk to the manager?
- Yeah.

01:19:23.805 --> 01:19:27.640
You have to understand that
we have very strict rules...

01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:30.235
regarding this sort of behavior here.

01:19:30.313 --> 01:19:33.908
- And I have always respected them.
- And this one time you didn't.

01:19:33.983 --> 01:19:36.746
Now, the problem, Mr. Brown,
is that this one time...

01:19:36.819 --> 01:19:40.914
happened in a room full of
other men who were watching.

01:19:40.989 --> 01:19:43.254
Now, if I let you back into the club...

01:19:43.325 --> 01:19:46.451
what's to stop them from
trying to do the same thing?

01:19:46.452 --> 01:19:47.262
I told you.

01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:50.423
Someone told me to do it.
I was set up.

01:19:50.499 --> 01:19:55.095
And you believed that someone?

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:59.266
- This is Security.
- Please, sit down.

01:19:59.342 --> 01:20:01.275
Thank you.

01:20:03.513 --> 01:20:06.948
Why did you touch her?

01:20:07.016 --> 01:20:10.746
- Well, I needed to make sure.
- Why?

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:13.845
What if she let you?
What would you have done?

01:20:13.922 --> 01:20:16.448
I'd have been disappointed.

01:20:18.026 --> 01:20:21.962
I'm not sure...
I understand you.

01:20:22.031 --> 01:20:25.398
That's not the way she was raised.

01:20:25.468 --> 01:20:28.027
You know her? Personally?

01:20:30.038 --> 01:20:33.804
There is another club I can recommend.

01:20:33.875 --> 01:20:35.968
I need to come here.

01:20:36.044 --> 01:20:40.606
- I understand that very well.
- No, I don't think you understand.

01:20:40.682 --> 01:20:44.312
Exotica is a special place.

01:20:44.387 --> 01:20:48.983
My mother was dedicated to creating a
very particular type of atmosphere...

01:20:49.057 --> 01:20:52.220
and I would like to maintain that.

01:20:52.294 --> 01:20:55.923
You don't understand.

01:20:58.735 --> 01:21:03.968
Mr. Brown, we're all aware
of what you've gone through.

01:21:04.039 --> 01:21:06.837
You've suffered a lot.

01:21:06.909 --> 01:21:12.006
But you have to understand that
Exotica is here for your amusement.

01:21:12.081 --> 01:21:15.608
We're here to entertain,
not to heal.

01:21:15.685 --> 01:21:19.017
There are other places for that.

01:21:21.922 --> 01:21:23.857
Other places?

01:21:23.925 --> 01:21:28.021
I can give you a list.

01:21:28.095 --> 01:21:30.120
Mr. Brown?

01:21:30.197 --> 01:21:32.256
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Brown?

01:21:48.717 --> 01:21:54.155
I just met this man in the washroom.

01:21:54.222 --> 01:21:56.156
What man?

01:21:56.224 --> 01:21:58.158
Well, I'm not sure.
I was in a booth.

01:21:58.226 --> 01:22:00.659
I didn't really have
a chance to see him.

01:22:00.728 --> 01:22:04.824
- So how did you meet him?
- He just started talking to me.

01:22:04.899 --> 01:22:06.993
And what did he say?

01:22:07.069 --> 01:22:12.005
Well, he said
he used to be your lover.

01:22:12.073 --> 01:22:15.304
Well, it's always
a sad moment, gentlemen...

01:22:15.377 --> 01:22:20.336
when that clock
strikes that magic hour...

01:22:20.415 --> 01:22:26.012
and we have to send you out into
the long and dark and lonely night.

01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:31.457
But just remember...

01:22:31.525 --> 01:22:35.963
we're only ever just a dream away...

01:22:36.031 --> 01:22:38.794
wherever that is.

01:22:56.884 --> 01:22:59.820
- I guess...
- I have to go.

01:23:01.389 --> 01:23:03.822
Oh, okay.

01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:06.486
Wait a minute.

01:23:06.561 --> 01:23:11.157
- Oh, no. Thomas, don't.
- No, no, no.

01:23:11.233 --> 01:23:15.999
- Thomas, please, don't.
- No, no. I insist.

01:23:16.071 --> 01:23:18.163
Please.

01:23:19.573 --> 01:23:21.667
Thank you.

01:23:30.217 --> 01:23:32.777
Your dad told me about...

01:23:32.853 --> 01:23:36.448
you not wanting to baby-sit anymore.

01:23:36.524 --> 01:23:40.291
There's no baby to sit.

01:23:43.031 --> 01:23:46.796
Well, I just want you
to know, I understand.

01:23:46.868 --> 01:23:50.303
Understand what?

01:23:50.371 --> 01:23:54.740
That this might all seem a little weird.

01:23:54.809 --> 01:23:58.141
A little?

01:23:59.547 --> 01:24:04.713
- I just want to thank you, Tracey.
- For what?

01:24:09.223 --> 01:24:12.317
You've been very patient.

01:24:12.392 --> 01:24:15.829
And...

01:24:15.896 --> 01:24:20.332
if you think the time has come for
this to end, then I understand.

01:24:27.574 --> 01:24:30.942
Thank you.

01:24:31.011 --> 01:24:33.445
Good night, Francis.

01:24:54.068 --> 01:24:57.128
He-He-He calls me from a table to dance.
Of course I expect you to do something.

01:24:57.204 --> 01:24:58.113
Christina...

01:24:58.114 --> 01:25:00.139
And then-and then he follows this guy
to the washroom...

01:25:00.206 --> 01:25:02.429
and he tells this guy
that, that he was my lover.

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:03.141
Well, he was.

01:25:03.209 --> 01:25:05.974
It's going too far, Zoe.

01:25:06.045 --> 01:25:10.983
Actually, baby, you have
no idea how far it's gone.

01:25:11.051 --> 01:25:13.645
You know,
I told him to touch you.

01:25:13.721 --> 01:25:17.521
I said you were into it. Yeah.

01:25:17.591 --> 01:25:21.017
It used to be wonderful
watching you dance for him,

01:25:21.018 --> 01:25:22.994
seeing how you could soothe him.

01:25:24.398 --> 01:25:27.332
I mean, it soothed me.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.598
You know, you soothed me.

01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:32.661
Do you understand that?

01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:38.273
- Hey, hey.
- Don't, don't, don't!

01:25:38.344 --> 01:25:42.281
- Stop. Stop that!
- Don't fucking touch me, you fucker!

01:25:42.349 --> 01:25:44.943
- Stop!
- Just fuck off, Zoe!

01:25:45.019 --> 01:25:48.613
- Stop it when I say! Eric!
- Stop it!

01:25:48.688 --> 01:25:50.622
Chill out! Chill out!

01:25:50.690 --> 01:25:53.284
Chill out! Relax!

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.954
- All right? Relax!
- Eric, come here!

01:25:56.030 --> 01:26:00.796
- John! Get out. What's the matter?
- No!

01:26:00.868 --> 01:26:04.132
Fuck off, Zoe! No!

01:26:28.562 --> 01:26:31.496
Morning, Thomas.

01:26:31.564 --> 01:26:35.091
- What happened?
- I had to leave.

01:26:35.168 --> 01:26:37.728
Did you hear everything?

01:26:37.804 --> 01:26:40.773
Yeah.

01:26:40.841 --> 01:26:43.435
Did you know?

01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:45.602
Did I know what?

01:26:45.678 --> 01:26:49.614
That she knew...
about your daughter.

01:27:00.525 --> 01:27:04.963
You know, when the,
when the police came to question me...

01:27:05.031 --> 01:27:08.797
they told me a lot of things.

01:27:08.868 --> 01:27:13.304
They told me that my wife was
having an affair with my brother;

01:27:13.372 --> 01:27:16.308
Had been for years.

01:27:16.376 --> 01:27:20.709
They told me that I thought
Lisa wasn't my daughter.

01:27:22.381 --> 01:27:25.647
They told me I thought she was Harold's.

01:27:25.717 --> 01:27:27.776
Wh-Why would they say that?

01:27:27.853 --> 01:27:32.416
Because they thought I could harm her...

01:27:32.492 --> 01:27:37.259
that I would harm her.

01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:43.098
And then they found the man
that... that did it.

01:27:43.168 --> 01:27:46.935
Let me go.

01:27:47.005 --> 01:27:51.101
And I went home.

01:27:53.846 --> 01:27:58.111
And then my wife was killed in a
car accident a couple months later.

01:27:58.184 --> 01:28:02.951
And Harold was in the car.

01:28:04.689 --> 01:28:07.750
He lived.

01:28:28.814 --> 01:28:30.907
What do you think it would have taken...

01:28:30.983 --> 01:28:34.418
for your father to kill someone?

01:28:34.486 --> 01:28:39.253
I'm asking because there's
someone that I want to kill now.

01:28:39.324 --> 01:28:44.763
I felt it last night as I
listened to him in the washroom.

01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:46.924
I don't understand.

01:28:46.999 --> 01:28:50.935
He set me up... to touch her.

01:28:51.003 --> 01:28:53.096
Why would he do that?

01:28:53.172 --> 01:28:57.768
He took something very special from me.

01:28:57.843 --> 01:29:01.939
I've had too many
special things taken away.

01:29:02.013 --> 01:29:06.951
- That's why we have to go back tonight.
- To kill him?

01:29:07.019 --> 01:29:09.309
What would you do, Thomas?
What would you do?

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:10.112
Well...

01:29:10.188 --> 01:29:13.454
- Well, I would talk to him.
- I can't even get in there.

01:29:13.525 --> 01:29:16.461
What would you do?

01:29:16.529 --> 01:29:19.965
You go back tonight...

01:29:20.032 --> 01:29:22.626
and you have her dance for you...

01:29:22.702 --> 01:29:25.569
and then you touch her.

01:29:25.638 --> 01:29:28.300
And he'll throw you out
just like he threw me out.

01:29:28.374 --> 01:29:30.898
But I'll be waiting outside
with the gun.

01:29:30.976 --> 01:29:34.003
I'm not gonna help you kill somebody.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.345
Not even to save a few years in prison?

01:29:37.416 --> 01:29:39.646
No.

01:29:42.153 --> 01:29:44.416
Well, to help me then?

01:29:49.661 --> 01:29:53.096
And that was Mirella,
gentlemen. Mirella.

01:29:53.163 --> 01:29:56.599
You can have her at your own
table for only five dollars.

01:29:56.668 --> 01:29:58.931
Thank you, Mirella.

01:30:01.172 --> 01:30:06.268
And now, it's always a pleasure to
announce to you our next dancer.

01:30:06.344 --> 01:30:10.440
Gentlemen, please, let's give
a big round of applause...

01:30:10.514 --> 01:30:15.714
for Christina.

01:33:43.526 --> 01:33:47.122
Don't be afraid.

01:33:47.196 --> 01:33:49.722
I know everything about you.

01:33:49.799 --> 01:33:53.736
What do you know about me?

01:33:56.039 --> 01:33:59.769
I found her.

01:33:59.843 --> 01:34:03.778
You found who?

01:34:09.051 --> 01:34:11.645
Your little girl.

01:34:38.848 --> 01:34:41.044
I found her, man.

01:34:45.022 --> 01:34:46.955
I found her.

01:35:49.518 --> 01:35:53.454
Yeah, play something happy.
Play something happy.

01:35:53.521 --> 01:35:55.489
Yeah. Hello.

01:35:58.027 --> 01:36:00.460
Okay, I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.

01:36:07.202 --> 01:36:09.637
- Hi, Christina.
- Hi.

01:36:09.704 --> 01:36:14.972
- I'm a little bit early.
- Yeah, th-that's okay. Come on in.

01:36:19.949 --> 01:36:22.474
Yeah, I mean,
it's difficult for me to tell...

01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:25.315
'cause I never had much of a
musical education myself...

01:36:25.387 --> 01:36:28.481
but her teacher thinks
she's really talented.

01:36:28.556 --> 01:36:32.583
And actually, we were thinking
of buying her a better piano.

01:36:32.661 --> 01:36:35.597
An exotic baby grand, you know?

01:36:35.664 --> 01:36:37.929
And when I mentioned "baby grand,"
do you know what she said to me?

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.436
She said, "Dad,
isn't that a contradiction in terms?"

01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:45.268
I mean, she just never
ceases to amaze me.

01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:47.275
I mean, she's eight years old.
Can you imagine?

01:36:47.342 --> 01:36:50.039
She can already identify-
Wh-What do you call that when...

01:36:50.112 --> 01:36:53.445
it's two words,
kind of cancel each other out?

01:36:53.516 --> 01:36:57.782
She just amazes me.

01:36:59.855 --> 01:37:04.621
Where's your mind?

01:37:04.693 --> 01:37:08.130
I was just thinking.

01:37:08.197 --> 01:37:11.462
About what?

01:37:11.534 --> 01:37:15.630
About the way you talk about Lisa.

01:37:15.704 --> 01:37:18.298
You get so excited.

01:37:18.373 --> 01:37:22.309
It's nice.

01:37:23.713 --> 01:37:27.443
Well, I'm sure your parents
talk about you that way too.

01:37:27.516 --> 01:37:30.576
I don't think so.

01:37:30.652 --> 01:37:34.418
Oh, I do.

01:37:34.489 --> 01:37:36.583
Why?

01:37:36.659 --> 01:37:40.925
Because you're a very
responsible young woman.

01:37:40.996 --> 01:37:45.434
Responsible to what?

01:37:45.501 --> 01:37:50.268
Well, to whatever it is
you believe you have to do.

01:37:50.338 --> 01:37:54.434
Like what?

01:37:54.509 --> 01:38:00.346
Well, Lisa loves it when you come
over to baby-sit, for example.

01:38:02.518 --> 01:38:06.283
She says you really listen to her.

01:38:06.354 --> 01:38:09.288
That's nice.

01:38:09.357 --> 01:38:12.053
She really listens to me too.

01:38:18.033 --> 01:38:21.093
She thinks you're not very happy.

01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:26.629
Listen, Christina,

01:38:26.707 --> 01:38:30.906
if there's, if there's ever
anything you want to talk about...

01:38:30.979 --> 01:38:34.506
about what might be going on
at home or whatever...

01:38:34.582 --> 01:38:39.417
you know that I'm here, okay?

01:38:41.321 --> 01:38:43.915
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:38:43.991 --> 01:38:46.084
Okay.

01:38:51.332 --> 01:38:54.926
Okay.

01:39:00.174 --> 01:39:03.406
Oh, no. It's okay.

01:39:06.513 --> 01:39:08.607
Thank you.

01:39:16.024 --> 01:39:19.551
You know, I really enjoy
these drives home, Mr. Brown.

01:39:19.627 --> 01:39:23.118
Good, good. So do I.

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.067
- Bye, Mr. Brown.
- Good-bye.
