WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:03.290
The Selfridge family is now the proud
owner of 12 department stores.

00:03.340 --> 00:05.750
All this expansion,
you're distracted, Pa.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.870
The women and the men can't get
on. It's making my life hell.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.510
We find places for them
in other departments.

00:11.560 --> 00:14.670
Henri is on his way to London!
Discharged from hospital.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.060
Why has he been in hospital?

00:18.400 --> 00:19.830
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.670
You're doing well. I want more.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.390
You can't have it. I haven't got it.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.830
You need someone to watch your
back. I'll work for you.

00:25.880 --> 00:29.070
- Mae?
- He took her away. I'll pay him back.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.910
Aren't you going to help with the production
line? Aeroplanes aren't cheap.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.150
You behave with her
or I'll give you hell.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.190
I'd like to see you try.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.750
Charge it to Selfridge account.

00:39.800 --> 00:45.190
My wife built cottages like this.
She believed that home was more
important than anything else.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.240
She was right.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

01:21.720 --> 01:23.790
The Lanvins from Paris!

01:27.960 --> 01:30.470
Gold embroidered Chantilly lace.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.480
The black silk taffeta bodice.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.950
Do not touch.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.670
I only want to learn the
right way to handle them!

01:40.720 --> 01:44.230
Madame Lanvin's creative director
will be here in the morning.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.880
I haven't time to train new staff.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.910
The dresses will speak
for themselves.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.950
They don't need fancy tricks.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.240
Or Miss Towler's
avant-garde distractions.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.480
- Has anyone seen the chief?
- You think he would be here.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.660
- Where is Mr. Selfridge?
- I don't know.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.480
Miss Webb!

02:18.920 --> 02:20.910
We need to talk.

02:20.960 --> 02:25.360
I've been informed that Lord Meadows
has pulled out of your building project.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.470
All that work gone to waste.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.590
I'm sorry if I sound bitter.
I know it's not your fault.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.560
I've been thinking long and hard
since you stormed into my office.

02:38.120 --> 02:42.400
These are houses that my
late wife built for charity.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.670
You must miss her terribly.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.720
I do.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.880
But I know that Rose would approve
of a project like yours.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.110
Sorry... So what are you saying?

02:57.160 --> 02:59.990
The field goes to auction
in less than a week.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.040
I'm going to bid.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.430
Are you... taking over the project?

03:05.480 --> 03:08.590
Let's start with the field
and we'll take it from there.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.590
I had a survey done. I can have that to you,
and the rest of the paperwork, by tomorrow.

03:12.640 --> 03:17.070
Good. This is the sort of endeavor
I've been looking for.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.110
Spare a copper for an ex-soldier!

03:19.160 --> 03:21.160
Want to buy some fags?

03:24.600 --> 03:27.400
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Bill.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.310
I could get the police to move
them along, Mr. Selfridge.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.150
To where exactly? Let them be.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.070
- You all right?
- Yeah, thanks, Charlie.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.990
I need you to summon a board
meeting as soon as possible.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.750
What has buying a field and building
houses got to do with the board?

03:48.800 --> 03:52.670
I'm going to ask the board for an
interest-free loan to set up a new company.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.230
Another company? Mr. Selfridge,
this is not our area of expertise.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.270
Last week, there was
talk of an aerodrome -

03:58.320 --> 04:00.910
A passing rumor only. I
have my heart set on this.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.350
Mr. Selfridge -

04:02.400 --> 04:06.190
I have the tightest timeframe to raise
the money. Get on it straight away.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.240
Thank you, Mr. Crabb.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.190
Rosalie! Welcome home, darling.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.310
Venice seems to have agreed with you.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.360
Good to be back, sir.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.910
Ah, what the heck is that?

04:25.960 --> 04:28.630
It's called a samovar, Pa.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.070
How Russians make tea apparently.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.110
Oh, must drink a lot of tea.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.470
It's a wedding gift
from Princess Marie.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.710
It's the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.670
- Grandma thinks so too.
- I'm sure we'll get used to it.

04:40.720 --> 04:45.310
Tea, Gordon? Working a samovar.
My life's ambition!

04:45.360 --> 04:48.670
Mr. Leclair is here, as you requested.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.990
Henri! How was your time in Scotland?

04:52.040 --> 04:54.030
We had a lovely time.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.190
- What can I do for you?
- I hate to ask you.

04:56.240 --> 04:59.110
But could you both
return to work early?

04:59.160 --> 05:04.950
I will make it up to you. Madame
Lanvin has chosen Selfridge's to
show her first London collection.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
And we could secure
an exclusive contract.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.590
- How can I help?
- It would be good if you and Agnes

05:11.640 --> 05:13.150
could be there tomorrow evening

05:13.200 --> 05:18.870
- to oversee Gordon and Mr. Thackeray.
- Of course, Harry. We'll be there.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.910
- Ow!
- Keep it down, please.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.950
No, good. I'm glad you like it.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.870
You have to look your
best tomorrow, Connie.

05:25.920 --> 05:29.920
This Lanvin event is an
opportunity for you to shine.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.950
All I want is a chance.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.590
I've found my thing
in Fashion, Kitty.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.780
Like you did with Beauty.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.830
The sisters of Selfridge's!

05:43.880 --> 05:46.710
If this fashion event is successful,

05:46.760 --> 05:50.350
I'm going to propose my
own cosmetics promotion.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.400
So keep trying.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.710
I got my book deal.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.470
Life At Home After War. What it's like
for our soldiers now they're hone.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.790
That's fantastic news, Frank!

06:01.840 --> 06:05.350
I was so looking forward to a bit
more time, just the two of us.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.350
I can go back and tell
Harry no if you want.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.800
Of course not. We can't
let Mr. Selfridge down.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.750
We make a good team.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.720
Do we really need this George?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.350
I need him.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.500
We've been managing just
fine, the two of us.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.080
Look, Elsa. We have fun now and then.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.750
But I run this club.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.540
George starts today and that's final.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.430
Not now.

07:13.480 --> 07:17.550
Madame Lanvin designed these dresses
especially for Selfridge's.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.030
She agrees to attend your event.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.640
Expects massive press exposure.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.870
And this is your response?

07:27.920 --> 07:31.080
So traditional. So passe.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.760
S'il vous plait, monsieur!

07:42.320 --> 07:45.060
You're not seeing my vision properly!

07:46.360 --> 07:49.030
I cannot subject Madame
Lanvin to this insult.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.790
I am withdrawing the dresses. And
we will not attend this evening.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.830
Please, Monsieur Longchamp.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.110
I've been on leave. We will fix this.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.160
- Isn't that right, Mrs. Leclair?
- Absolutely.

08:09.840 --> 08:14.430
I give you one last chance. We chose Selfridge's
because of your legendary displays.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.880
You have until this afternoon.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.830
Always the same with you, Thackeray.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.470
You see the dresses as art. Women
want to see themselves in them.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.620
How dare you swan back
here and criticize me!

08:30.520 --> 08:34.030
- Our big war hero.
- Let's concentrate on fixing this.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.350
Nothing to fix, as
far as I'm concerned.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.600
That Longchamp is just
another French idiot.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.150
He's set his heart on building
houses now. Whatever next?

08:46.200 --> 08:49.500
I fear his heart is ruling
his head these days.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.910
- Mr. Grove.
- Miss Blenkinsop.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.950
The Information Bureau -

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Damn!

08:58.840 --> 09:00.830
..is a new service.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.950
Customers come from all over to ask
questions on any subject whatsoever.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.310
How can I provide answers when the untrained
staff don't know where to look?

09:09.360 --> 09:11.990
I understand your
difficulties, Miss Blenkinsop.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.760
We shall be a laughing stock
if we continue like this.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.110
I'm up to my neck.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.430
Extra female staff
all round the store.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.990
Additional training required.
Unhappy heads of department.

09:29.040 --> 09:33.310
Roger, I could really do with your support
in getting through to the chief.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.350
I'm sorry, Arthur.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.910
My advice is, put your head
down, weather the storm.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.960
Mr. Crabb.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.270
What's happening with
the board meeting?

09:45.320 --> 09:47.990
This evening was the only time
they could convene unfortunately.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.040
Fine. What time?

09:51.000 --> 09:54.990
I haven't booked anything. You're
hosting Madame Lanvin this evening.

09:55.040 --> 09:58.350
Mr. Thackeray is quite able to
hold the fort. Book it, Crabb.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.640
Father! We... We have
a serious problem.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.630
At last, Mr. Selfridge.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.750
These are the displays.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.150
Was he very disappointed?

10:16.200 --> 10:18.190
I'm afraid so.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.230
Mr. Selfridge...

10:20.280 --> 10:22.270
I have put weeks of work into this.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.310
It's not good enough.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.040
Mr. Gordon gave me his full approval.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.840
- Gordon?
- Mrs. Leclair was on leave.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.390
- We did our best.
- You both let me down.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.830
And what about you letting us down?

10:38.880 --> 10:40.870
What's that supposed to mean?

10:40.920 --> 10:44.230
You've shown little interest in
the store's biggest-ever event.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.350
- Our reputation -
- Not your reputation. My reputation.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.390
And this is my department.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.750
I will not be told what to do by this
man, drafted in at the last minute.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.670
- Don't speak to me like that.
- Time things were said!

10:55.720 --> 10:57.710
You foist unskilled staff on us.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.910
You're not here when we need you!

10:59.960 --> 11:02.150
- Thackeray -
- I'm not one of your yes men.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.190
I don't employ yes men.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.310
I employ men I expect
to get it right.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.670
- And what about you?
- Thackeray, stop now.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.040
You haven't been getting it right
since Mrs. Selfridge died.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.360
Get out. Get out!

11:21.840 --> 11:24.940
Get out of my store and
don't ever come back!

11:42.480 --> 11:44.820
Mr. Thackeray has been sacked!

11:45.280 --> 11:48.710
- That can't be true!
- I heard with my very own ears.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.030
The chief told him to get
out and never come back!

11:51.080 --> 11:52.430
What's going on?

11:52.480 --> 11:54.790
Mr. Thackeray's been
given the heave-ho.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.830
Idle gossip.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.680
Gossip?

11:59.560 --> 12:03.030
I'm sorry you had to witness
that unpleasant encounter.

12:03.080 --> 12:07.630
Mr. and Mrs. Leclair, can
you solve this disaster?

12:07.680 --> 12:10.390
We have very little time,
but we will do our best.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.430
It will be fine. Don't worry.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.550
- Tell me how I can help.
- Leave it to the experts, Gordon.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.390
- But -
- In this crisis, you don't
want to summon the board.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.440
Yes, we do.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.790
Sergeant, what are you doing here?

12:29.840 --> 12:31.830
I like to know where all my men are.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.980
Ain't you going to ask
us in, Lance Corporal?

12:37.800 --> 12:40.590
You won't be staying long.
I've a business to run.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.630
That's why we're here.

12:42.680 --> 12:47.560
I says to Silas, if any man wants cut-price
smokes to sell, it will be Victor Colleano.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.740
I trust you had a good
journey, Lord Loxley.

13:10.280 --> 13:14.350
I've come a very long way. I expect
to be impressed, Mr. De Bolotoff.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.400
Please.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.550
You drive an hard bargain.
I thought you'd be a pushover.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.590
I'm not a pushover for anyone.

13:29.640 --> 13:34.520
Seeing as the smokes probably
came off the back of a Dover
lorry, you're quids in anyway.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.230
Charlie Copperstone was
bad news in the regiment.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.870
- You shouldn't have let him in.
- Stop worrying.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.910
They'll be on their way soon enough.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.000
Look at you. You done
well for yourself.

13:49.960 --> 13:53.260
You can't let us go without
offering us a drink.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.430
I can.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.750
It will carry six passengers.
Little point building one.

13:58.800 --> 14:03.200
Spread the cost. Build five or six
and then you have an air taxi service.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.950
I can see it's a real
passion of yours.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.200
- Did you get it from your father?
- No, I don't remember him.

14:12.120 --> 14:16.630
Well, I'm sure your father-in-law must
be champing at the bit to invest.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.990
He's refused to invest
in the aerodrome.

14:19.040 --> 14:22.240
And... I don't think he's
too interested in my plane.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.430
- Why is that?
- Pushed too hard.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.550
It can be a fault of mine.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.270
I've always admired determination
in a smart young man.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.510
If Selfridge isn't interested
in you and your ideas,

14:35.560 --> 14:37.560
I am.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.840
- Really?
- Young men like you...

14:42.720 --> 14:44.720
.. are the future.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.350
And then you turn this.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.470
And something is supposed to happen.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.510
Oh, you'll figure it out, Fraser.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.550
Thank you, ma'am.

14:58.600 --> 15:04.470
Darling, I hate to see you apart from
Serge so soon after your return.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.070
He had to be at the hangar.
I understand that.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.110
But it's so very far away.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.630
Your father will never get to know
him better while he's there.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.550
And you hardly get
to see him, darling.

15:18.120 --> 15:23.150
I was wondering... Your mother's
old painting studio.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.910
It would make a wonderful
office for him.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.390
He could do his design work there.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.080
I would like to see more of Serge.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.760
Shall we take a look?

15:38.680 --> 15:41.550
I'd have to approach the
subject very delicately.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.600
Of course.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.160
Thank you.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.350
Is she ever going to spend any
time in her own apartment?!

15:53.400 --> 15:56.390
She's not in her apartment, ma'am.

15:56.440 --> 16:00.550
And a huge hotel bill
for her has come in.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.740
Made out to Mr. Selfridge.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.310
Keep this to ourselves for now.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.120
How about this?

16:21.960 --> 16:26.630
If we move it to the fashion floor, the whole
thing will have a more modern, airy feel.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.670
Will it be enough?

16:28.720 --> 16:31.720
All we can do with the
time we've got left.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.100
It's going to be a
tough first day back!

16:39.640 --> 16:43.440
Arthur? It's Victoria
sponge. Your favorite.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.070
I don't have the stomach for it.

16:50.760 --> 16:55.080
It's not your fault that Mr.
Selfridge sacked Mr. Thackeray.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.880
Am I a yes man, Mildred?

17:01.160 --> 17:04.359
- What do you mean?
- Would you say I had backbone?

17:06.119 --> 17:08.520
You're the bravest man I know.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.710
Mr. Selfridge has always been
able to count on my loyalty.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.750
But I'm torn, Mildred.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.190
He's about to embark
on a charity project.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.440
But it's risky.

17:22.640 --> 17:26.150
And I'm not sure I can endorse
it to the board in all conscience.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.300
Then you must follow
your conscience, Arthur.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.880
Yes.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.120
People say it gets easier.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.990
I'm not sure I believe them.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.320
Pa thinks his brave face fools us.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.520
I'm glad you're staying
here, Rosalie.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.270
Wonderful, darlings! We're
in agreement, then.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.310
Agreement about what?

18:16.360 --> 18:19.310
It was just a suggestion, Violette.

18:19.360 --> 18:24.040
That maybe in time, Serge might
use this studio for an office.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.190
I can't believe you'd even
think of such a thing.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.750
Rosalie is running this
house now, Violette.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.790
Pa will never agree.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.640
And I'm going to make
sure he doesn't.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.030
This is all we have left of her.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.190
Can I help with anything, Mr. Crabb?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.440
No, no. Everything's fine.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.070
Violette!

19:27.120 --> 19:31.550
Princess Wizwaz, whatever her name
is, wants to take over Ma's studio!

19:31.600 --> 19:34.630
- For what?
- An office for her precious son.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.480
He does live with us so we
have to all try to get along.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.510
I am going insane at home.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.070
Gordon is here. Rosalie
has the house to run.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.830
- And I have nothing.
- Let's talk about this later.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.870
Give me something to do, Pa. Please.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.310
- Like what, sweetheart?
- Get me out of that house!

19:53.360 --> 19:55.350
Give me a job here.

19:55.400 --> 19:59.470
It's out of the question. We have more
than enough female staff as it is.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.510
Please, Pa.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.560
Look...

20:05.160 --> 20:07.150
Why don't you do some traveling?

20:07.200 --> 20:09.190
- Get rid of me, you mean.
- No.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.550
Go to Chicago. Visit
some of Ma's family.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.590
I know how much you love it there.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.110
And hope that I meet
some rich Yank to marry.

20:16.160 --> 20:19.030
- That's not what I mean.
- That's exactly what you meant.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.270
A Vanderbilt? An Astor, maybe?
You already have a princess.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.920
- Violette -
- Thanks for nothing, Pa.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.230
- Where are you going?
- Shopping.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.620
All I'm good for apparently.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.510
You've got your month's
money. What do you want?

20:48.560 --> 20:50.550
To give you your money's worth.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.590
By tipping you the wink.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.310
Those were nicked. Keep
them out of sight.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.350
Our boys are out looking
for stolen fags around town.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.400
Consider me tipped.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.550
Seeing as you bought that lot,

21:06.600 --> 21:09.840
I know people could put you
in the way of other stuff.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.630
A one-off. Thanks, but no thanks.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.390
You can't stay clean
forever, Colleano.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.350
- Not in this business.
- It's not about staying clean.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.740
It's about staying in charge.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.740
Same way out as you came in.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.270
So we position the
plinths around here.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.310
Yeah. We need spotlights.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.270
Monsieur Longchamp will
be downstairs any minute.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.590
We are nowhere near
getting this right.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.740
It's the best we can
do with so little time.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.710
Can I make a suggestion?

21:49.760 --> 21:51.760
By all means.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.470
- What do you think?
- I love it.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.590
But will Monsieur Longchamp?
He's a tricky customer.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.640
How do you mean?

22:13.440 --> 22:15.440
Leave this to me.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.430
Monsieur Longchamp,
Violette Selfridge.

22:20.480 --> 22:23.420
I hear you are a difficult
man to please.

22:25.640 --> 22:29.270
My father always says this
is much more than a store.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.950
We have a remit to entertain
customers too.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.100
And what do you like
to do for entertainment?

22:35.840 --> 22:38.630
Are you flirting with
me, Monsieur Longchamp?!

22:38.680 --> 22:41.150
Would that be so very terrible?

22:41.600 --> 22:45.350
No. As long as you like
my idea for tonight.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.870
It's not me you have to please.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.750
Let's do this your way, then.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.000
Will your boss be pleased?

22:54.640 --> 22:57.110
Can you type these up
for me, Miss Plunkett?

22:57.160 --> 22:59.270
I need them for tonight's
board meeting.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.790
- Mr. Selfridge, I absolutely need -
- Later, Crabb.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.710
- I need to speak with you -
- I just don't have the time.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.270
- I must insist.
- Don't badger me.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.460
It's not the day for it.

23:11.920 --> 23:16.600
Please inform Mr. Selfridge that Mr. Crabb
intends to badger until he gets a result.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.220
Thank you, Miss Plunkett.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.710
Well done, my darling!

23:22.760 --> 23:25.070
If I play my cards right,
he might back me.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.470
Of course he's keen. You forget
how impressive you are.

23:28.520 --> 23:31.640
Hm. Shame my father-in-law
doesn't think so.

23:32.920 --> 23:36.150
Go back to Harry. Give
him one last chance.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.750
Tell him you have another investor.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.790
And why would I do that?

23:40.840 --> 23:44.230
Because you live in his house.
You are part of his family now.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.270
- Wouldn't know it.
- Serge.

23:46.320 --> 23:50.630
You have to trust me on how a
gentleman should conduct himself.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.670
Fine.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.710
We'll do it your way.

23:54.760 --> 23:58.190
He's so beautiful, Doris.
He's just like you.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.230
The only one to get my blond hair.

24:00.280 --> 24:04.310
Little Ernest. Sweeter
than a violet cream!

24:04.360 --> 24:08.160
If anyone had told me I'd
have five children by now...

24:18.520 --> 24:21.390
I'm glad I'm not still working
in the store though.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.430
- We're well out of it, Miss Mardle.
- Oh? What do you mean?

24:24.480 --> 24:26.470
Pressure, day in, day out.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.190
People demanding things
at a moment's notice.

24:29.240 --> 24:31.230
Dealing with difficult customers.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.580
Not to mention the staff
goings-on and the like.

24:36.720 --> 24:40.600
Every single thing I just said, you're
missing horribly, aren't you?

24:42.960 --> 24:44.950
When Florien died,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.480
I had to think about what I was going
to do for the rest of my life.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.820
I'm a company woman,
Doris. I like structure.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.070
But I'm also a changed woman.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.260
And I can't go backwards.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.200
We've all been changed by the war.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.390
I'm glad you came today, Miss Mardle.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.430
Old friends should stick together.

25:08.480 --> 25:11.600
I think it's about time
you called me Josie.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.590
Mr. De Bolotoff to see
you, Mr. Selfridge.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.590
Serge. What can I do for you?

25:23.640 --> 25:28.070
I'm here to tell you that I have
a financier interested in my plane.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.430
Good. I'm happy for you.

25:30.480 --> 25:34.110
I thought it only proper to give
you a last chance to invest.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.150
Seeing as we're family.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.990
Even if I wanted to,
my hands are tied.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.430
How so?

25:40.480 --> 25:43.070
I'm about to bid for that
field in West London.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.110
For a non-profit housing project.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.870
- I found that field.
- I know.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.910
So maybe you can help me with this -

25:49.960 --> 25:54.350
I am not interested in houses. It
is a perfect site for an aerodrome.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.070
First, you work on the plane. Then
you worry about the aerodrome.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.990
I'm sure that your financier
will agree. Who is it?

26:01.040 --> 26:03.150
Lord Loxley. And I
wouldn't bet on it.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.200
Loxley?

26:06.600 --> 26:08.590
- You know him?
- Stay away from him.

26:08.640 --> 26:13.030
That man is dangerous. Cut off
all contact with him immediately.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.070
I'll make my own decisions, thanks.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.110
No, I mean it.

26:17.160 --> 26:21.190
Serge, that is not a request!

26:21.240 --> 26:23.230
And I mean it too.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.270
It's just business, Harry.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.420
And you of all people
should appreciate that.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.520
Don't, Mr. Crabb. For both
of our sakes, don't.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.440
So be it.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.100
Directors are starting to arrive.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.080
Arthur?

27:02.920 --> 27:04.910
Are you all right? You look unwell.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.240
I'll join you in the boardroom
shortly, Mr. Grove.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.710
Madame Lanvin.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.590
- Ohh!
- We are honored by your presence.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.630
Monsieur Leclair!

28:03.680 --> 28:08.510
Such a handsome young man
when we last met 'a Paris.'

28:08.560 --> 28:10.550
What happened?!

28:10.600 --> 28:15.150
That's the survey result. And personal
references for my past work.

28:15.200 --> 28:18.270
Very thorough. That should
impress the board.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.310
Wish me luck, Miss Webb.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.750
I hope to see you downstairs
afterward for the fashion event.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.790
Of course.

28:25.840 --> 28:31.030
I thought Princess Marie would
be here. She does enjoy a party.

28:31.080 --> 28:35.950
She's devastated to miss this evening, but
she's entertaining some Russian friends.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.470
- At her apartment?
- I assume so.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.800
Psst!

28:51.360 --> 28:53.350
Good evening, Miss Calthorpe.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.910
Accessories is looking very
attractive under your direction.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.950
I've done my best, Miss Mardle.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.110
But I'm sure you'll find some
improvements when you return.

29:02.160 --> 29:06.670
I'm here to see Mr. Grove. I won't be coming
back to Accessories, Miss Calthorpe.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.920
You keep up the good work.

29:12.720 --> 29:16.020
Madame Lanvin and Mr. Leclair,
together, please.

29:20.600 --> 29:25.590
Madame Lanvin, are you aware your countryman
survived the horrors of Verdun? A war hero.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.150
Oh, no, please. This
evening is not about me.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.710
It's about the wonderful
Madame Lanvin and -

29:30.760 --> 29:35.560
No, we must applaud our
war hero Monsieur Leclair.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.420
Have you got anything to say?

29:50.600 --> 29:52.590
Mr. Leclair?

29:52.640 --> 29:54.630
Mr. Leclair, is there a problem?

29:54.680 --> 29:56.680
I'm sorry.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.110
Henri, why is he asking about Verdun?

30:03.160 --> 30:05.150
- What happened?
- I...

30:05.200 --> 30:07.190
- Talk to me.
- I can't.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.230
I can't.

30:09.280 --> 30:14.200
Ladies and gentleman, if you could now make
your way through to the fashion department.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.590
The land goes to auction
next week, so time is short.

30:22.640 --> 30:27.470
With a loan from Selfridge's, the
government will match our investment.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.630
Which means they will be able
to sell the houses at cost.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.070
The project will enhance Selfridge's
legacy in the long run.

30:34.120 --> 30:36.350
Which increases share value.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.390
I assume you're all with me.

30:38.440 --> 30:40.440
So...

30:42.440 --> 30:44.440
- Mr. Crabb.
- I...

30:45.840 --> 30:47.980
I have something to say.

30:51.060 --> 30:54.570
The document I have prepared shows
the scope of our expansion.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.610
Expansion is healthy.

30:56.660 --> 30:58.820
Yes, and so is prudence.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.890
Gentlemen, the cost of
war is still with us.

31:02.940 --> 31:07.490
Surplus female staff are currently
adding 16.4% to our payroll.

31:07.540 --> 31:12.170
All this whilst pursuing an
ambitious expansion programme.

31:12.220 --> 31:14.890
We now have 12 new stores.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.930
More in our sightlines.

31:16.980 --> 31:17.970
Mr. Crabb -

31:18.020 --> 31:22.210
We have also gambled on costly innovations
like the Information Bureau.

31:22.260 --> 31:24.530
Which we are hoping
will be successful.

31:24.580 --> 31:29.940
Whereas our mail order service has proved
to be a significant financial liability.

31:33.020 --> 31:35.610
Gentlemen, if you look
at this next document,

31:35.660 --> 31:38.530
you will see the impact
of our expansion programme

31:38.580 --> 31:41.680
in relation to our annual
share projections.

31:51.980 --> 31:53.970
Violette Selfridge!

31:54.020 --> 31:58.530
You will see that Cosmetics, Beauty, and
Fashion are our biggest growth areas.

31:58.580 --> 32:02.420
It is my opinion that we should
focus on what we do best.

32:17.620 --> 32:19.620
We are a retailer.

32:20.700 --> 32:24.610
Construction of housing, no
matter how well intentioned,

32:24.660 --> 32:27.200
is outside our area of expertise.

32:28.060 --> 32:32.580
And crucially, it is an endeavor
that will reap no tangible profit.

32:33.900 --> 32:37.580
Which will affect you gentlemen
as majority shareholders.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.620
Profit must be at the heart
of our business strategy.

32:42.980 --> 32:45.980
Another time, this project
might be viable.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.100
Now is not that time.

32:56.740 --> 33:00.970
I think that we all value
Mr. Crabb's opinion.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.010
I certainly do.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.050
But it is one man's opinion.

33:05.100 --> 33:08.740
Let's have a show of hands so we
can proceed with this venture.

33:31.820 --> 33:33.810
I see.

33:33.860 --> 33:36.130
Now, that concludes
our business here.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.920
Thank you, and good night, gentlemen.

34:12.860 --> 34:15.969
You'll be all over the papers
tomorrow, Miss Selfridge!

34:16.020 --> 34:19.420
Every girl will want to
wear what you're wearing!

34:44.940 --> 34:46.940
Evening, Mr. Leclair.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.889
- What can we get for you?
- Whiskey.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.940
A large one, please.

35:08.420 --> 35:10.930
Firstly, let's deal with
the surplus women.

35:10.980 --> 35:12.970
We'll give them a month's wages.

35:13.020 --> 35:15.220
Mr. Grove will be relieved.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.730
And what of Mr. Thackeray?

35:18.780 --> 35:21.980
He crossed the line. I
played my part in that.

35:22.460 --> 35:24.450
No going back.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.500
I understand.

35:27.780 --> 35:29.770
I'll spare you from dismissing me.

35:29.820 --> 35:32.160
My resignation, Mr. Selfridge.

35:34.460 --> 35:36.460
I won't accept it.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.890
But I will raise that money.

35:40.940 --> 35:42.930
One way or another.

35:42.980 --> 35:45.250
It's my job to protect the company.

35:45.300 --> 35:47.640
Even if that means from you.

35:49.300 --> 35:51.300
So...

35:54.020 --> 35:56.160
Where does that leave us?

35:57.220 --> 35:59.620
Changed, I fear, Mr. Selfridge.

36:00.580 --> 36:02.580
Changed.

36:11.780 --> 36:15.410
- Bravo. Wonderful.
- Why don't we celebrate?

36:15.460 --> 36:17.450
Yes, why not?

36:17.500 --> 36:20.290
It's duchess satin with
gold frayed embroidery.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.330
It's a work of art, madam.

36:22.380 --> 36:25.420
- Looks like you're a natural.
- I love this department!

36:27.450 --> 36:28.450
Yes.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.490
You should have seen him, Josie.

36:30.540 --> 36:32.530
I'm so worried about him.

36:32.580 --> 36:35.690
I doubt very much you're the
only wife feeling like that.

36:35.740 --> 36:38.850
The men who went to war aren't
the same men who came back.

36:38.900 --> 36:40.890
But I'm his wife now.

36:40.940 --> 36:43.410
Aren't we supposed
to share everything?

36:43.460 --> 36:46.330
Maybe there are some things
he can't share, Agnes.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.370
Miss Mardle.

36:48.420 --> 36:51.540
- I believe you were looking for me.
- Yes, indeed, Mr. Grove.

37:01.900 --> 37:05.620
Fashion? But I came here
to formalize my resignation.

37:06.860 --> 37:09.770
Selfridge's is in need of
some stability right now.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.530
You were one of the first
people the chief hired.

37:12.580 --> 37:15.290
I'm not qualified to take
over this department.

37:15.340 --> 37:19.780
Even if only on a temporary basis,
we need people of your calibre.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.290
- Don't make me beg.
- You could have anybody.

37:24.340 --> 37:26.130
You don't need me.

37:26.180 --> 37:28.180
The store needs you.

37:32.700 --> 37:34.690
I need you.

37:34.740 --> 37:39.130
Begging is a charming quality in dogs,
Mr. Grove. I don't recommend it for you.

37:39.180 --> 37:41.180
Did it work?

37:42.580 --> 37:44.580
When do I start?

37:48.700 --> 37:50.770
Please excuse my late arrival.

37:50.820 --> 37:52.810
You're a busy man.

37:52.860 --> 37:56.410
Besides, we've had your wonderful
daughter, Mr. Selfridge.

37:56.460 --> 38:00.250
How clever of you to
employ her talents here.

38:00.300 --> 38:04.780
She took part in the modeling of the dresses
with Selfridge panache and flair.

38:06.100 --> 38:09.290
She's always had an eye for
the spotlight, our Violette.

38:09.340 --> 38:12.050
So have I earned something
more permanent here?

38:12.100 --> 38:16.740
If it was any other day, but thank
you so much for helping out.

38:17.980 --> 38:19.970
Where were you?

38:20.020 --> 38:22.010
Verdun.

38:22.060 --> 38:25.380
You know, your lot holding
out probably turned the war.

38:28.860 --> 38:31.140
- You?
- Mostly the Somme.

38:37.020 --> 38:39.010
It's over.

38:39.060 --> 38:41.060
It's never over.

38:51.340 --> 38:53.340
He's had enough.

38:54.420 --> 38:57.820
I know a man looking for
oblivion when I see one.

39:17.740 --> 39:19.730
How did it go?

39:19.780 --> 39:21.770
Not well, I'm afraid.

39:21.820 --> 39:25.290
It will be a long time before a
field like that comes up again.

39:25.340 --> 39:29.340
I know. That's why I will
find another way. I promise.

39:30.220 --> 39:32.610
Your projections and
plans were admired.

39:32.660 --> 39:36.060
I... I was the stumbling
block, I'm afraid.

39:38.060 --> 39:42.060
Please... Let me at least
gift you this suit.

39:42.900 --> 39:46.900
I wouldn't hear of it! Sell your suits
to your customers, Mr. Selfridge.

39:48.980 --> 39:53.290
Miss Webb, I've probably done everything
wrong that's possible to do today.

39:53.340 --> 39:55.330
Let me do one good thing.

39:55.380 --> 39:57.380
Please.

40:01.060 --> 40:03.050
This one occasion.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.100
- Only.
- Thank you.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.500
You have an excellent eye.

40:13.060 --> 40:15.050
- Been here before?
- Once.

40:15.100 --> 40:18.180
There is Victor himself. He
used to work for my father.

40:20.500 --> 40:23.420
- Some drinks?
- Yes, sure.

40:31.340 --> 40:34.450
We need drinks. You have
Miss Selfridge in the house.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.700
Send someone over, please.

40:43.300 --> 40:45.300
Some people, eh?

40:55.380 --> 40:58.210
- Serge.
- Delighted to see you again.

40:58.260 --> 41:00.250
I feel I should tell you.

41:00.300 --> 41:04.010
I went back to my father-in-law to
give him a last chance to invest.

41:04.060 --> 41:06.890
Oh. Am I surplus to
requirements, then?

41:06.940 --> 41:10.210
He refused me again. In fact,
we had a bit of a falling-out.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.250
He warned me to keep away from you.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.290
Was he right?

41:14.340 --> 41:16.330
The man holds a grudge.

41:16.380 --> 41:19.570
As far as I'm concerned, it's
all water under the bridge.

41:19.620 --> 41:22.530
What I need to know is does
it affect your offer to me?

41:22.580 --> 41:27.180
Not at all. In fact, I'm glad to
see you've got a mind of your own.

41:28.580 --> 41:31.880
Let's pick up where we
left off today, shall we?

41:33.020 --> 41:36.530
Can you gather the family in the
drawing room, please, Fraser?

41:36.580 --> 41:38.720
Certainly, Mr. Selfridge.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.690
Don't you think you've had enough?

41:42.740 --> 41:44.740
Elsa.

41:47.140 --> 41:49.130
What is he doing?

41:49.180 --> 41:51.650
- Let me go.
- I'll deal with this.

41:54.180 --> 41:57.890
We asked for drinks. Can we have
some service, please, Mr. Colleano?

41:57.940 --> 42:00.130
I don't work for
Selfridge's any more.

42:00.180 --> 42:02.780
And my guests address me as Victor.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.210
I'll get to you as soon as I'm ready.

42:05.260 --> 42:07.260
Violette.

42:17.980 --> 42:20.580
What's he talking to Victor about?

42:22.060 --> 42:24.530
Come on, pull yourself together.

42:27.860 --> 42:29.860
Hello, Victor.

42:30.700 --> 42:32.700
Hello, Agnes.

42:35.380 --> 42:37.380
Your wife's here.

42:40.220 --> 42:42.490
Henri, please, let's go home.

42:42.540 --> 42:44.540
Please.

42:45.460 --> 42:47.450
Where on earth has Serge got to?

42:47.500 --> 42:50.210
My friends were looking
forward to meeting him.

42:50.260 --> 42:53.650
- I thought he was with you.
- No. They can meet him another time.

42:53.700 --> 42:55.690
- Marie!
- Darling.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.730
Are you back in your apartment now?

42:57.780 --> 43:00.050
A rather large hotel
bill arrived here.

43:00.100 --> 43:02.090
Charged to my son.

43:02.140 --> 43:04.850
I think I mentioned something
to Harry about it.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.890
My apartment is being decorated.

43:06.940 --> 43:11.250
In any case, I am sure he will not begrudge
his new family the comforts of home.

43:11.300 --> 43:13.290
Gordon!

43:13.340 --> 43:16.250
I have some news that I want
to share with the family.

43:16.300 --> 43:19.400
- I'm glad you're here, Marie.
- What is it, Pa?

43:22.420 --> 43:24.730
I intend to bid for a
field in West London.

43:24.780 --> 43:26.770
For Serge's aerodrome?

43:26.820 --> 43:28.810
Something far more important.

43:28.860 --> 43:31.770
A lasting tribute to
your mother's memory.

43:31.820 --> 43:35.930
To build houses for heroes
returning from war.

43:35.980 --> 43:38.520
Rose would approve entirely, son.

43:39.340 --> 43:41.690
- Does Serge know about this?
- He does.

43:41.740 --> 43:43.730
And I want you all to know.

43:43.780 --> 43:47.620
I intend on pursing this
venture, come what may.

43:57.540 --> 43:59.610
Isn't that Selfridge's son-in-law?

43:59.660 --> 44:02.500
Yes. I've taken him under my wing.

44:03.860 --> 44:05.850
Interesting piece of information.

44:05.900 --> 44:10.050
Selfridge is thinking of investing
in a charitable housing project.

44:10.100 --> 44:13.330
And he's going to bid
for some land in Acton.

44:13.380 --> 44:15.370
Nothing in that for you!

44:15.420 --> 44:17.420
On the contrary.

44:19.420 --> 44:22.360
I'm going to help him
dig his own grave.

44:26.540 --> 44:29.290
Selfridge's is launching
our biggest beauty event.

44:29.340 --> 44:31.330
You haven't slept in 24 hours now.

44:31.380 --> 44:33.850
- Some things you don't want to know.
- I have to.

44:33.900 --> 44:36.010
- I heard you were back.
- Did you miss me?

44:36.060 --> 44:37.850
Stay away from me, Loxley.

44:37.900 --> 44:40.090
Did you tell Loxley
about the project?

44:40.140 --> 44:42.850
- I was just trying to help.
- I don't want your help!

44:42.900 --> 44:44.410
You want a job.

44:44.460 --> 44:47.570
- They gave my job to a girl.
- Someone ought to do something.

44:47.620 --> 44:50.530
The war's changed him.
He frightens me.

44:50.580 --> 44:52.570
You're very kind, Mr. Selfridge.

44:52.620 --> 44:54.610
Harry, please.

44:54.660 --> 44:56.660
Nancy.
