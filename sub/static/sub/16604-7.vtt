I want to learn stuff.

12:12.156 --> 12:13.925
Well, what do you want me
to do about it?

12:13.926 --> 12:15.829
Help me.

12:15.830 --> 12:18.000
- You need me?
- Mm-hmm.

12:18.001 --> 12:20.137
Aw. Oh, son.

12:20.138 --> 12:21.941
I...

12:21.942 --> 12:24.446
Shit, we better scram.

12:28.455 --> 12:30.191
(WATER RUNNING)

12:30.192 --> 12:31.761
Sounds like the shower's still on.

12:31.762 --> 12:33.330
That dude covets my second wife,

12:33.331 --> 12:35.001
and now he's coveting my hot water.

12:35.002 --> 12:36.670
I'm glad the truth is finally out.

12:36.671 --> 12:38.340
Now we can be done with him.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.111
Why didn't you tell us sooner?
We're family.

12:40.112 --> 12:41.713
We could have figured it out together.

12:41.714 --> 12:43.617
He threatened to cut off
every other finger

12:43.618 --> 12:45.789
on all of our hands if I told you.

12:45.790 --> 12:47.358
- Gosh, shit.
- (KNOB CREAKS, WATER STOPS)

12:47.359 --> 12:49.229
- Water shut off.
- Go.

12:49.230 --> 12:50.833
Act natural.

12:56.344 --> 12:58.748
What's natural about that?

12:58.749 --> 13:00.786
I'm gonna pretend
to put away clean plates.

13:00.787 --> 13:02.655
Shh. Shut up. He's coming.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.797
(YVON SINGING IN RUSSIAN)

13:10.472 --> 13:11.974
Yo, Yvon, what's up, brother?

13:11.975 --> 13:13.878
I'm just putting away some clean plates.

13:13.879 --> 13:15.348
He doesn't even understand English.

13:15.349 --> 13:18.355
(BOTH SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

13:26.739 --> 13:28.842
You know, he can kind
of act sweet sometimes.

13:28.843 --> 13:30.578
He wants me to go
upstairs and to fuck him.

13:30.579 --> 13:32.715
Oh, Jesus. I take it back.

13:32.716 --> 13:35.421
- You... you can't go up there.
- I'm not going to.

13:35.422 --> 13:36.690
What are you going to tell him?

13:36.691 --> 13:38.394
Nothing. We are leaving. Let's go.

13:38.395 --> 13:40.398
- What? Where?
- We go to Alibi.

13:40.399 --> 13:42.502
We'll take it from there. Okay.

13:42.503 --> 13:44.439
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

13:44.440 --> 13:46.076
Wait. We're going to leave
an angry Russian with a hard-on

13:46.077 --> 13:47.078
upstairs in our bedroom?

13:47.079 --> 13:49.716
(DOOR OPENS)

13:49.717 --> 13:52.388
- How's your food?
- It's good. How's yours?

13:52.389 --> 13:53.825
Pretty good. I like this place.

13:53.826 --> 13:56.496
Mm. My, uh, my muffin top is delicious.

13:56.497 --> 13:57.966
You want the bottom half?

13:57.967 --> 14:00.237
You did not order a muffin
just to make that joke.

14:00.238 --> 14:02.843
Maybe.

14:02.844 --> 14:04.312
You're a fucking punk.

14:04.313 --> 14:08.053
Thank you.
(CHUCKLES)

14:08.054 --> 14:11.159
- This morning was fun.
- Yeah.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.199
Might be nice to have
a little variety sometime.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.006
Instead of just jacking
each other off, you mean?

14:18.007 --> 14:20.578
- You ever get fucked?
- No.

14:20.579 --> 14:22.281
Not even before you transitioned?

14:22.282 --> 14:24.854
- No. How about you?
- Mm-mm.

14:24.855 --> 14:27.391
- Why not?
- Just never really a question.

14:27.392 --> 14:30.698
All the guys that I was with
just wanted me to do it to them,

14:30.699 --> 14:33.872
'cause I'm so good.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.976
You ever thought
about switching it up...

14:35.977 --> 14:37.913
Being a little bit more sex-positive?

14:37.914 --> 14:40.651
Um, what's sex-positive, again?

14:40.652 --> 14:43.958
All sex is good sex
as long as it's consensual.

14:43.959 --> 14:45.795
Oh, like me fucking you.

14:45.796 --> 14:48.233

- Uh-huh.

(CHUCKLES)

14:50.773 --> 14:53.544
If we had clear boundaries,

14:53.545 --> 14:56.216
and I knew that you weren't assuming

14:56.217 --> 14:57.518
that just because I'm the trans guy,

14:57.519 --> 15:00.391
I get fucked...

15:00.392 --> 15:02.295
I'd consider it.

15:02.296 --> 15:04.300
Yeah?

15:07.039 --> 15:09.275
Okay, then...

15:09.276 --> 15:11.413
I would, too.

15:11.414 --> 15:14.052
Cool.

15:14.053 --> 15:15.755
I told Wendell he needed to service

15:15.756 --> 15:17.058
these machines more often.

15:17.059 --> 15:18.761
Can you fix the leak?

15:18.762 --> 15:22.101
I'll change the hoses and washers.

15:22.102 --> 15:23.805
Should last you a couple of months,

15:23.806 --> 15:26.343
but it's just a band-aid fix.

15:26.344 --> 15:28.580
Real problem is the pump.

15:28.581 --> 15:31.119
- How much?
- Machine is an antique.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.156
I don't have the parts for it anymore.

15:33.157 --> 15:34.525
Better off just to buy a new one.

15:34.526 --> 15:36.262
(SCOFFS) Jesus. What's that cost?

15:36.263 --> 15:37.498
Like, 500 bucks?

15:37.499 --> 15:39.202
For your home maybe.

15:39.203 --> 15:41.306
These are commercial.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.677
You're looking at three grand each.

15:43.678 --> 15:47.184
- Are you serious?
- That's the low end.

15:47.185 --> 15:49.389
You want me to check out
the rest of the machines?

15:49.390 --> 15:50.759
Yes, thank you.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.061
Just stay out there with Franny, Neil.

- Fiona?
- (SIGHS) What, Debs?

15:54.166 --> 15:55.668
I quit school. I need you to
come down to the courthouse

What are you talking about?

I will explain on the way.
Come on, we got to go.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.682
Okay, you quit school?

16:02.683 --> 16:03.985
The counselor said it was fine.

16:03.986 --> 16:05.587
He suggest I take the GED. Come on.

16:05.588 --> 16:07.024
We got to be at the courthouse
in 45 minutes.

16:07.025 --> 16:08.660
The GED test is hard.

16:08.661 --> 16:10.264
I already took it this morning.

16:10.265 --> 16:13.503
You got to study for it.
I-I worked on mine for months.

16:13.504 --> 16:16.342
- I passed.
- You did?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.180
Yeah, it was easy.
I only got two questions wrong.

I-I'm busy right now.

We can make an appointment,
we can go next week.

most of these machines

16:41.594 --> 16:43.063
in the next few years.

16:43.064 --> 16:45.200
I suggest starting on a couple
of them right now.

16:45.201 --> 16:47.538
Six thousand, four hundred bucks?

16:47.539 --> 16:49.108
I gave you a break on the labor.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.047
The man's a thief. Nothing wrong
with these machines.

It'll only take 15 minutes,
Fiona, then you can come back...

16:53.886 --> 16:56.322

by the meter in the back.

You need to call the gas company.

17:06.978 --> 17:10.017
They'll send somebody right over.

17:10.018 --> 17:12.421
Say good-bye to your Aunt Fiona, Franny.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.926
Could be the last time
you see her before DCFS comes

17:14.928 --> 17:17.064
and rips you from
your mother's loving arms

17:17.065 --> 17:19.167
and sends you to live
with some foster family

- Why?

Not enough kids to keep the place open.

- Probably overcrowded.

from the Dioceses.

of hundred years old.

Sure. What?

19:17.038 --> 19:18.640
Don't care...

19:18.641 --> 19:20.710
as long as I can wear sweatpants
and no makeup

19:20.711 --> 19:22.347
and not have to deal with assholes.

19:22.348 --> 19:23.948
Except for one.

19:24.954 --> 19:26.824
What did Debs do?

19:26.825 --> 19:28.927
Took over Lucas's room for Franny.

19:28.928 --> 19:30.130
What'd she do that for?

Rubber looks good on you.

19:54.780 --> 19:57.084
Ah, that's what, uh, half a
college education will get you.

19:57.085 --> 19:58.787
- College?
- Yeah, I was expelled.

19:58.788 --> 20:00.423
I, uh, smashed my professor's car.

20:00.424 --> 20:02.361
- That would be me.
- (CHUCKLES)

20:02.362 --> 20:03.696

20:03.697 --> 20:06.102
I'm a glutton for punishment.

20:06.103 --> 20:08.671
The provost granted your appeal request.

20:09.355 --> 20:10.878
I didn't make an appeal request.

20:10.879 --> 20:12.916
Yeah. You're too stubborn
to admit your mistakes,

20:12.917 --> 20:14.251
so I did it for you.

20:14.252 --> 20:16.613
- Congrats.
- Nice going, Teach.

20:17.498 --> 20:19.295
And you did that because?

20:19.641 --> 20:21.386
You made good on your rehab stint.

20:21.768 --> 20:23.469
Oh, so you just took it upon yourself?

20:23.470 --> 20:25.140
You're welcome.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.578
Thanks, but I'm not going back.

20:27.579 --> 20:29.081
At least go to the hearing.

20:29.082 --> 20:30.684
Bring a couple character witnesses.

20:30.685 --> 20:33.189
There must be someone
who thinks you're worth saving.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.993
Nah. I doubt it.

20:34.994 --> 20:37.264
Then let the appeal board
expunge your record,

20:37.265 --> 20:38.700
in case you change your mind
and want to apply

20:38.701 --> 20:40.003
to college in the future.

20:40.004 --> 20:41.606
I'm not gonna change my mind.

20:41.607 --> 20:45.547
Either way, a clear record
would be a good thing.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.952
Don't be a douche bag. Just do it.

20:47.953 --> 20:51.002
- What do you have to lose?
- Yeah, what she said.

20:51.794 --> 20:54.265
All right, I'm cashing out
and going home.

20:54.266 --> 20:55.667
Want to come by whenever you're done?

20:55.668 --> 20:57.939
Yeah. Is it cool if I, uh, wear this?

20:57.940 --> 20:59.794
As long as you wear nothing else.

21:00.846 --> 21:02.338
Bye, Teach.

21:06.590 --> 21:09.996
I'd go into cardiac arrest
if I worked here.

So...

21:13.304 --> 21:15.032
you gonna go to the hearing?

21:16.508 --> 21:18.947

21:28.233 --> 21:29.501
In what language, Kev?

21:29.502 --> 21:31.672
Oh, shit, you're right.

21:31.673 --> 21:32.975
We can call the INS.

21:32.976 --> 21:34.578
Will you please stop reorganizing?

21:34.579 --> 21:36.482
I need to keep busy when I'm nervous.

21:36.483 --> 21:38.586
We can't call INS
because they will find out

21:38.587 --> 21:39.856
