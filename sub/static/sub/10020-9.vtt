00:06.867 --> 00:07.882
Previously on ER...

00:07.883 --> 00:10.381
No one has ever gotten me a real
diamond before, Mark.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.480
How dare you accuse me of manipulation!
I deserve better than that!

00:14.481 --> 00:16.729
Here's the deal.
Let me shadow you.

00:16.730 --> 00:19.261
Throw in a few procedures.
A couple of stitches here and there.

00:19.262 --> 00:21.645
And I'll make your little lawsuit vanish.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.221
- It's Carol.
- What?

00:23.222 --> 00:25.544
Carol Hathaway.
Now, you are sworn to secrecy.

00:25.579 --> 00:27.166
I didn't mean to mislead you
about my family.

00:27.467 --> 00:28.725
It's really not that big a deal.

00:28.726 --> 00:30.593
You told me we had to cut P.A.s.

00:30.594 --> 00:34.522
Why don't you give Kerry and me
another day to recheck our figures?

00:34.523 --> 00:35.890
I love you, Carol.

"Obstruction of Justice"

00:45.249 --> 00:47.493
Hey. I didn't hear you get up.

00:47.712 --> 00:49.373
I didn't want to wake you.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.167
Where are you going?

00:52.387 --> 00:54.428
I gotta go sign some papers.

00:55.058 --> 00:56.720
Your last day was yesterday,
wasn't it?

00:56.895 --> 00:58.439
That's for unemployment.

00:58.648 --> 01:01.141
Did you take a look at the want ads?

01:01.403 --> 01:02.483
What's the point?

01:02.697 --> 01:06.401
We've been back for four days. All
you've done is look at the sports page.

01:07.206 --> 01:09.283
Don't start, okay?

01:12.841 --> 01:14.420
This...

01:15.429 --> 01:18.183
This Atlanta high-rise job,
it's gonna come through.

01:21.106 --> 01:22.138
I can feel it.

01:23.903 --> 01:26.111
I left some chicken in the fridge
for lunch.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.660
I don't know how long I'll be.

01:32.543 --> 01:34.454
- Good morning, Kerry.
- Hey, Don.

01:34.672 --> 01:35.704
What is all this?

01:35.924 --> 01:38.963
It's computer equipment
Dr. West is setting up...

01:39.180 --> 01:42.552
...thank you... for the Synergix
Attending coverage.

01:42.728 --> 01:46.776
Well, your trial period's a good idea.
Letting them show their stuff.

01:47.070 --> 01:50.239
Listen, any further rumblings
from Jeanie Boulet?

01:50.451 --> 01:52.991
Yesterday was her last day.
She left without a word.

01:53.164 --> 01:55.954
I think her threats came
out of the heat of the moment.

01:56.170 --> 01:59.007
We don't need a P.A.
alleging that she was fired...

01:59.217 --> 02:01.010
...because she was HIV-positive.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.678
Jeanie knows she was fired
for financial reasons.

02:03.892 --> 02:06.599
If anyone questions that,
they can look at the budget.

02:06.772 --> 02:08.433
Hold that elevator!

02:08.943 --> 02:11.650
You handled a difficult situation
very well, Kerry.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.408
Thank you, Don.

02:15.413 --> 02:17.039
Hey, sweetie.

02:17.250 --> 02:20.336
Boy, were you ever snoring
when I left this morning!

02:21.591 --> 02:24.048
Oh, poor baby. You have a hangover?

02:24.262 --> 02:26.969
I don't think I should've had that
fourth margarita.

02:27.894 --> 02:31.016
I went to put your present on
and when I came back...

02:31.233 --> 02:34.153
- ... you were out like a light.
- I missed the grand finale?

02:34.364 --> 02:37.367
I think I need a B-12 shot
to keep up with you.

02:37.578 --> 02:41.413
You know what? I got just what
the doctor ordered. Get up.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.836
- Turn around.
- Easy. I could hurl.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.342
Just keep your eyes closed.

02:47.972 --> 02:49.088
Why?

02:49.308 --> 02:51.386
Just do as I say. Don't be a pooper.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.313
Stand there. Hold on.

02:53.524 --> 02:55.602
- What's going on?
- Just don't turn around.

02:55.778 --> 02:58.022
And keep your eyes closed.

02:58.658 --> 03:00.070
Okay.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.702
Take two of these
and call me in the morning.

03:58.775 --> 04:01.528
The interns see meningitis
in every kid with a runny nose.

04:01.696 --> 04:04.699
- I thought Doug was coming back.
- He called. Car trouble.

04:04.868 --> 04:06.410
I mean here. He called here.

04:06.620 --> 04:09.457
- Mark and Cynthia are in there.
- So?

04:10.459 --> 04:12.453
- What's going on in there?
- Nothing.

04:12.921 --> 04:15.758
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:20.265 --> 04:22.343
Jeanie. Hey.

04:23.645 --> 04:26.018
This is Harold Percy.
And this is Barbara Liebman.

04:26.190 --> 04:27.567
Hi. I'm Jeanie Boulet.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.728
- I filled them in as best I could.
- Thanks.

04:29.904 --> 04:32.112
I gotta get to work. Good luck.

04:33.410 --> 04:35.237
Would you like a cup of coffee?

04:35.412 --> 04:36.789
- Decaf?
- Always.

04:37.666 --> 04:42.627
Dr. Doyle said you were fired because
you're HIV-positive. Is that true?

04:44.008 --> 04:45.753
Yes. I believe it's true.

04:46.094 --> 04:50.558
I was reprimanded for doing a
lifesaving procedure in a body cavity.

04:50.769 --> 04:53.142
A few weeks later I was fired.

04:53.648 --> 04:55.938
The hospital claims
it's budgetary reasons.

04:56.110 --> 04:57.902
They always give other reasons.

04:58.071 --> 05:00.741
- Were you ever disciplined before?
- No, never.

05:00.950 --> 05:03.276
Actually, I was October's
employee of the month.

05:03.453 --> 05:05.662
Good. Did you keep a log
of what was said?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.417
No.

05:08.420 --> 05:10.912
- Is it too late to do anything?
- Not necessarily.

05:11.132 --> 05:13.291
We'll outline a protocol
for you to follow.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.085
I warn you, it might get ugly.

05:16.306 --> 05:18.133
I want my job back.

05:18.768 --> 05:20.476
Hey, can I borrow a buck?

05:20.687 --> 05:21.851
No.

05:22.273 --> 05:23.518
See you.

05:23.984 --> 05:25.360
Here.

05:27.322 --> 05:30.574
They say JFK never
carried any cash, either.

05:32.955 --> 05:34.119
Oh, yeah?

05:34.290 --> 05:36.118
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.913
- Hey, Scooter!
- Chase?

05:40.549 --> 05:41.879
What are you doing here?

05:42.094 --> 05:44.218
I came to see the good doctor.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.463
Anna?

05:45.641 --> 05:47.017
- This is my cousin Chase.
- Hi.

05:47.226 --> 05:49.220
This is Anna Del Amico.
We intern together.

05:50.857 --> 05:52.934
I see why you got into medicine.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.359
Come on, gang.
We're behind on sutures.

05:55.530 --> 05:56.776
- Anna, could you...?
- Sure.

05:56.949 --> 05:58.859
I'll get started on these, Scooter.

06:00.537 --> 06:01.569
Nice.

06:01.748 --> 06:03.492
So, what's up?

06:03.709 --> 06:08.005
I escaped to the Vineyard
for Thanksgiving.

06:08.216 --> 06:11.302
I was hauling firewood
when a spider got me.

06:11.511 --> 06:13.007
Oh, man!

06:14.850 --> 06:17.223
Dr. Greene, hello.

06:17.562 --> 06:18.892
Ellis West.

06:19.107 --> 06:23.058
I'm an SPG doctor.
Synergix Physicians Group.

06:24.155 --> 06:25.614
Good for you.

06:27.243 --> 06:28.952
Listen. Whatever your misgivings...

06:29.121 --> 06:31.957
...when the SPG Attendings
start backing you up next week...

06:32.125 --> 06:33.870
...we'll make your job a lot easier.

06:34.087 --> 06:37.504
You're preaching to the choir.
Less work is fine with me.

06:37.717 --> 06:40.922
Good. Then I'll just set up
and stay out of your way.

06:41.264 --> 06:43.471
Kerry. This is Dr. West.

06:43.684 --> 06:45.227
Hi. We know each other.

06:45.437 --> 06:46.635
- How are you?
- Good.

06:46.855 --> 06:50.357
- What's all this?
- This is the Wertz dictation system.

06:50.569 --> 06:53.275
Dictate on the fly,
it gives you verbal prompts.

06:53.490 --> 06:55.282
Here. This you put on your belt.

06:55.493 --> 06:57.533
It puts everything on a floppy.

06:57.955 --> 07:01.408
- And this is the earpiece?
- The earpiece and the microphone.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.422
I don't know how my mom ever
kept these things straight.

07:09.639 --> 07:13.686
Cynthia, this is awkward for me.
But it's my job to tell you.

07:13.896 --> 07:17.396
Some people find certain things
in the workplace inappropriate.

07:17.609 --> 07:19.353
Like sex in the lounge. So...

07:19.570 --> 07:21.730
We didn't have sex in the lounge.

07:22.657 --> 07:25.826
I was just trying to cheer up
three of the seven dwarfs.

07:25.996 --> 07:29.034
- What?
- Grumpy, Sleepy and Doc.

07:29.251 --> 07:30.830
Mark's all three.

07:32.547 --> 07:36.417
Just a little more discretion, okay?

07:36.637 --> 07:38.547
What's the matter with you?

07:38.723 --> 07:40.717
You should be happy that he's happy.

07:45.858 --> 07:48.102
Jeanie? I thought
your last day was yesterday.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.148
No. I'm gonna keep working here.

07:50.324 --> 07:51.652
Didn't Weaver lay you off?

07:51.825 --> 07:53.107
I'm not accepting it.

07:53.286 --> 07:55.114
You go ahead, girl.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.417
Hello! That smarts.

08:02.091 --> 08:03.467
Sorry.

08:04.803 --> 08:06.963
We missed you
at Thanksgiving dinner...

08:07.557 --> 08:09.884
...at least until that
third round of martinis.

08:10.103 --> 08:12.476
- Was Gramps after you?
- About what?

08:12.690 --> 08:15.478
He's back trolling the gene pool
for a successor.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.105
We've been through this, Chase.

08:18.281 --> 08:20.738
You're done.
You'll need IV antibiotics.

08:21.912 --> 08:23.287
You're still his first choice.

08:23.706 --> 08:26.542
Elliot's in Thailand, A.C.'s lazy,
Barbara's...

08:26.710 --> 08:27.874
- Barbara.
- Barbara.

08:29.130 --> 08:30.329
What about you?

08:30.508 --> 08:33.546
You're already an exec with
the company. He knows your work.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.388
That's why he wants you.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.851
Why can't anybody just accept the fact
that I'm a doctor?

08:40.145 --> 08:43.849
It's like my photography
or A.C.'s summer stock.

08:44.068 --> 08:46.988
Gramps just sees them as phases.

08:47.199 --> 08:50.285
All the little chickens will
come home to roost.

08:50.746 --> 08:52.121
Not me.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.671
Hi. I'm Dr. Weaver.
What's the problem?

08:56.879 --> 08:58.707
I'm having a sickle cell crisis.

08:58.924 --> 09:01.595
And somebody stole my Percodans
at the bus station.

09:03.765 --> 09:06.802
- Where's your pain?
- It's like having a migraine all over.

09:07.019 --> 09:10.188
He says the pain is 10 out of 10.
Pulse and temp are normal.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.154
My pulse and temperature
don't usually go up.

09:13.321 --> 09:15.991
I need 250 of Demerol
as soon as possible.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.774
- That's a big dose.
- I know me!

09:18.996 --> 09:21.036
I need to break the cycle now.

09:21.457 --> 09:22.952
BP's normal. 130/80.

09:23.502 --> 09:26.540
Let's run in two liters of saline.
O-2, six liters.

09:26.757 --> 09:29.046
Draw a CBC with a retic count.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.717
And give him 60 of Toradol.

09:31.889 --> 09:34.298
- I'm allergic to it.
- Two of Stadol then.

09:34.518 --> 09:37.010
That too!
Demerol's all I can take. Okay?

09:37.230 --> 09:38.262
Who's your doctor?

09:38.482 --> 09:40.642
I go to the Pontiac Clinic.

09:40.861 --> 09:43.068
Okay. Give him 50 of Demerol, IV.

09:43.281 --> 09:46.034
Repeat once in 15 minutes, PRN.

09:46.202 --> 09:47.614
50 won't touch me, miss.

09:47.830 --> 09:50.156
Give the medication a chance,
Mr. Jackson.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.285
I need 250!

09:52.712 --> 09:54.705
Let's call the clinic and see.

09:57.218 --> 09:59.460
Rollover TC.
Daughter was seat-belted, Mom wasn't.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.757
Mother's shocky.
Chest and abdominal trauma.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.223
BP's 80 palp. Pulse, 140.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.810
Daughter's BP is 90/50.
Pulse, 120.

10:07.024 --> 10:10.442
Left leg's mangled and pulseless.
Massive blood loss on scene.

10:10.655 --> 10:12.030
Anna, with me in Trauma 2.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.900
I'll take this one.

10:16.830 --> 10:18.539
- Need a hand?
- Thanks. Check her leg.

10:18.708 --> 10:20.582
Everybody, this is Dr. West.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.876
- My mom's calling me.
- I'm sorry. What?

10:23.089 --> 10:25.213
- Where's my mom?
- Next door with Dr. Greene.

10:25.384 --> 10:27.794
BP's down. 90/50.
Pulse, 120.

10:28.013 --> 10:30.849
Open saline wide.
CBC, type and cross for four.

10:31.142 --> 10:33.895
Chest, C-spine, pelvis and left femur.

10:34.063 --> 10:36.224
- Don't touch my leg!
- Get some pressure on it!

10:36.401 --> 10:38.311
We wear trauma gear
in the trenches now.

10:38.487 --> 10:42.072
Too late. Leg's pulseless,
massive bone and tissue loss.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.244
- Probably have to amputate.
- Is my mom okay?

10:45.789 --> 10:48.281
- Sounds like a larynx fracture.
- Does your neck hurt?

10:49.420 --> 10:51.709
- Think you're right.
- All right. What do we got?

10:52.215 --> 10:54.588
- Make room for the cavalry.
- Thanks for your help.

10:54.761 --> 10:58.178
Rollover TC.
She's hypotensive, an open femur...

10:58.350 --> 11:00.723
...and a possible larynx fracture.
Her mom's in 2.

11:00.895 --> 11:03.767
- Are you having trouble breathing?
- Am I gonna die?

11:03.941 --> 11:06.647
- We're not gonna let that happen.
- Set up for intubation.

11:06.820 --> 11:08.101
- Mind if I take her?
- Sure.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.405
You take this.
I'll check next door.

11:12.537 --> 11:15.029
- Hook her to the Thora-Seal.
- How's she doing?

11:15.416 --> 11:18.205
- Allison?
- DPL's grossly positive, 2.

11:18.421 --> 11:20.248
- I'm losing a pulse.
- She's arresting!

11:20.423 --> 11:21.705
Here's more O-neg!

11:21.884 --> 11:24.210
- Start CPR. I'll intubate.
- She's flatline!

11:24.430 --> 11:26.589
I'll cross-clamp the aorta.
Thoracotomy tray.

11:28.685 --> 11:30.145
Hang two more and bag her.

11:30.313 --> 11:32.722
Get an abdominal CT
and finish the x-rays upstairs.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.728
If we hurry,
maybe we can save her leg.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.656
- Do they need me in 2?
- No. There are three docs in there.

11:37.824 --> 11:39.734
Stat page Dr. Romano to the O.R.

11:39.952 --> 11:43.120
Dr. Weaver. I'm glad you
reconsidered the P.A. cutbacks.

11:43.332 --> 11:46.418
- What are you talking about?
- Jeanie, she just clocked in.

11:46.712 --> 11:49.335
Sickle cell guy's had 100 of Demerol.
Says it hasn't helped.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.050
Did you call the Pontiac Clinic?

11:51.218 --> 11:54.387
- I tried. Number's not in service.
- Why am I not surprised.

11:54.557 --> 11:57.227
Crit and retic count okay.
White count's normal.

11:57.436 --> 12:01.222
What is the problem with you people?
I need more Demerol.

12:01.400 --> 12:06.029
Run the rest of the saline, four tabs
of codeine to go and street him.

12:06.199 --> 12:07.480
This should be interesting.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.404
- What?
- Look.

12:10.289 --> 12:12.496
- May I speak with you?
- Sure.

12:12.709 --> 12:15.628
Just keep taking deep breaths.

12:15.838 --> 12:17.582
- What are you doing?
- I'm working.

12:17.799 --> 12:20.089
You've been terminated,
you're off payroll...

12:20.261 --> 12:22.468
...and you're not covered
by malpractice insurance.

12:22.639 --> 12:25.725
All right. I won't see any more
patients. But I'm staying.

12:26.604 --> 12:30.057
Don't humiliate yourself by being
forcibly removed from the premises.

12:31.027 --> 12:33.982
You do what you need to do.
I'll do what I need to do.

12:40.541 --> 12:43.033
Time of death, 12:07.

12:43.253 --> 12:44.878
We have to tell her daughter.

12:45.047 --> 12:46.709
She went right from CT to O.R.

12:46.926 --> 12:48.550
I'll take care of it.

12:50.764 --> 12:53.221
She was so worried about her daughter.

12:59.736 --> 13:02.228
Hey, Mark.
How're you doing?

13:02.406 --> 13:05.077
Today's the day we save some lives.
I'm very excited.

13:05.619 --> 13:06.651
Where's my scrubs?

13:06.830 --> 13:09.868
Listen, we gotta be low-key about this.
If anybody asks...

13:10.085 --> 13:11.365
I'm your attorney, okay?

13:11.586 --> 13:15.088
I'm here to research your work so
I can prepare a proper defense.

13:15.259 --> 13:16.290
Sounds good.

13:16.468 --> 13:18.463
Calm down.
I'm not expecting anything big.

13:18.681 --> 13:20.590
A couple of sutures here and there.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.641
I cannot let you practice medicine.

13:22.853 --> 13:24.930
What are you talking about?
We had a deal.

13:25.106 --> 13:27.480
I defend you in the civil rights
suit against you.

13:27.651 --> 13:30.025
In exchange, I play doctor for a day.

13:30.239 --> 13:31.437
We'll see.

13:31.783 --> 13:33.693
- How's my case going?
- Where's my scrubs?

13:33.911 --> 13:37.032
I'll get you your scrubs.
Just try and do it low-profile.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.620
Right. Don't worry about your case.
It's gonna vanish into thin air.

13:40.796 --> 13:42.291
You made quite a deal for yourself.

13:42.465 --> 13:46.631
Have Dr. Anspaugh call me as soon as
he's free. It's very important.

13:49.309 --> 13:50.637
Hi, guys. How'd it go?

13:50.852 --> 13:53.060
Marquis de Sade's got
nothing on Scooter.

13:53.272 --> 13:56.310
- Don't call me that at work.
- Marquis de Sade or Scooter?

13:56.485 --> 13:58.812
- That's funny.
- Want to go to lunch at Shaw's?

13:58.989 --> 14:01.398
- I can't, I'm on duty.
- Blow it off.

14:01.993 --> 14:04.486
It's my job.
I can't just blow it off.

14:04.706 --> 14:06.664
Okay, Dr. Schweitzer. Just asking.

14:06.834 --> 14:11.130
My family thinks I'm just dabbling
in medicine till I come to my senses.

14:11.341 --> 14:12.801
That sounds like fun.

14:13.761 --> 14:17.132
Eddie, you bastard!
You're trying to kill me!

14:17.308 --> 14:18.340
Shut up, Darlene.

14:18.518 --> 14:21.271
See? You're ganging up on me.

14:21.565 --> 14:23.059
I can see the appeal.

14:23.275 --> 14:25.434
Come by the house sometime.
We'll all party.

14:25.653 --> 14:27.065
- Ciao.
- Like that'll happen.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.862
A couple winners.
Wife says hubby tried to beat her up.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.076
Complains of pain.
Vitals and mental status normal.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.658
Never mind being plastered.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.580
You're going to jail, Darlene!

14:37.212 --> 14:39.371
Let me up! I gotta pee.

14:39.590 --> 14:42.379
ETOH, bump on the head, contusions
and abrasions. No pain.

14:42.553 --> 14:45.306
The woman tried to run him over.
No LOC, vitals normal...

14:45.474 --> 14:47.017
...oriented times three.
GCS, 15.

14:47.186 --> 14:50.222
- You'll be all right, Eddie.
- Okay. I'll take him. You take her.

14:51.525 --> 14:52.640
Why the cuffs?

14:52.819 --> 14:56.235
She's under arrest for assault with
a deadly weapon, pick-up truck.

14:56.448 --> 15:00.579
I was just trying to get away.
This son of a bitch was chasing me!

15:00.747 --> 15:04.034
He's on Eddie's side because
he works with the police motor pool.

15:04.252 --> 15:06.709
You want to uncuff her
so I can examine her?

15:07.173 --> 15:10.543
- While she's here, she's my patient.
- No matter where she is, she's my perp.

15:10.761 --> 15:13.799
You'd interfere with the care
of a woman with critical injuries?

15:13.974 --> 15:15.719
For God's sake!

15:19.524 --> 15:23.690
- Were you trying to kill yourself?
- No. I was just mad at Eddie is all.

15:23.864 --> 15:25.656
- Take any drugs?
- Me? Never.

15:25.867 --> 15:28.074
I want a blood alcohol
and a drug screen.

15:28.245 --> 15:30.119
- Would you excuse us?
- I want the tests.

15:30.290 --> 15:33.126
I need to evaluate her.
Wait outside while I examine her.

15:37.300 --> 15:40.753
With the extrication, there's been
two hours of pulseless warm ischemia.

15:40.931 --> 15:42.924
She's got massive crush injury
to the leg.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.474
Her abdominal CT is normal.
Her vitals are stable.

15:45.646 --> 15:48.316
But with contamination,
bony loss, protracted shock...

15:48.483 --> 15:50.809
...an above-the-knee amputation
is indicated.

15:50.987 --> 15:54.903
I say we save Allison's leg with
a vascularized free fibular transfer.

15:55.077 --> 15:58.032
That's four hours of anesthesia
on a limb that's too far gone.

15:58.206 --> 16:01.493
Look, face it. At this point,
a long surgery is too risky.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.588
- Know how to do a fibular transfer?
- No, I don't.

16:04.757 --> 16:07.084
- You think I shouldn't do it?
- Have you done one?

16:07.260 --> 16:10.013
No. But she's a good candidate
for an aggressive approach.

16:10.181 --> 16:12.509
You mean she's a good guinea pig
for practice.

16:12.686 --> 16:16.352
Don't be so dramatic. She is young.
She deserves a chance to keep her leg.

16:16.524 --> 16:17.604
Got a hot one, Lizzie?

16:17.777 --> 16:20.613
Couldn't ask for a better candidate
for a free fib transfer.

16:20.781 --> 16:23.107
Wait till you
see her in action, Peter.

16:24.911 --> 16:26.621
You worked something out
with Jeanie?

16:26.790 --> 16:29.163
No. She's fired,
but she's protesting it.

16:29.377 --> 16:33.423
I'm trying to get Legal to deal with it.
But Anspaugh's in a meeting.

16:33.633 --> 16:36.089
Man, I'm glad I don't have your job!

16:37.472 --> 16:38.847
No!

16:39.141 --> 16:40.684
We'll go to trial.

16:40.894 --> 16:43.896
Irv, my client's willing
to lose 100 G's...

16:44.107 --> 16:46.065
...rather than settle, okay?

16:47.069 --> 16:49.941
No, no, no. It's your move, Irv.

16:51.075 --> 16:52.321
Oh, baby!

16:52.536 --> 16:55.574
- What's this about 100 grand?
- It's not about you.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.620
Could you give me some specifics
on how you'll defend me?

16:58.836 --> 17:01.294
- Where do we change from?
- This way.

17:01.507 --> 17:03.086
Tell me about my defense.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.752
What's there to tell?
We're gonna kill them!

17:06.682 --> 17:10.431
We'll go for assault with a deadly
weapon. But no caving this time.

17:10.604 --> 17:12.432
Go for it, Billy. Kill the bitch.

17:12.607 --> 17:13.637
Right.

17:13.817 --> 17:15.893
Sounds like you boys
have it all worked out.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.156
Stick to the medicine.
I'll handle the law enforcement.

17:19.366 --> 17:22.867
Your x-rays are normal.
You'll be back to battering in no time.

17:23.080 --> 17:25.406
What, "battering"?
We scuffled is all.

17:25.626 --> 17:28.961
Did your wife lose consciousness at
any time after she was assaulted?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.131
Hey, she tried to kill me!

17:31.301 --> 17:33.590
No. I don't want it. Get off of me!

17:33.763 --> 17:36.005
Come on, nurse. Just draw the blood.

17:36.308 --> 17:38.800
Nobody's drawing her blood
without her permission.

17:38.978 --> 17:42.930
This is permissible search.
Delay will result in loss of evidence.

17:43.152 --> 17:45.858
- She's bradying down. Pulse, 39.
- Darlene?

17:46.031 --> 17:48.024
She might have taken drugs
and been afraid to tell us.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.316
She wouldn't lie.

17:49.495 --> 17:52.069
Let's give her 0.5 of atropine.

17:52.290 --> 17:53.999
Let's pump her stomach. Ewald tube.

17:54.168 --> 17:55.876
- I want those tests.
- Get a warrant.

17:56.087 --> 17:57.832
You got one coming, okay?

17:58.007 --> 17:59.288
Get Greene to back us up.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.876
I don't need any backup.
I know my rights and hers.

18:02.054 --> 18:04.677
Darlene, I want you to try
and swallow this tube.

18:08.564 --> 18:10.058
Afternoon.

18:10.358 --> 18:11.984
Hey, hello, doctor.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.199
Herb Spivak.

18:19.413 --> 18:22.035
Maggie Doyle.
Are you a Synergix Attending?

18:23.378 --> 18:24.788
What do we have here?

18:25.547 --> 18:28.918
A partial extensor tendon laceration.

18:29.136 --> 18:32.388
You best treat that
with irrigation and débridement.

18:32.599 --> 18:35.767
Give it a couple of loose sutures
and a splint and you'll be fine.

18:35.979 --> 18:37.973
- Why don't you come with me?
- Thanks.

18:38.191 --> 18:39.389
How did you know that?

18:39.609 --> 18:42.528
I hired a doctor for a couple of weeks
from an ER for $100 an hour.

18:42.739 --> 18:46.904
He told me everything. Blood gases,
chest tubes, peritoneal gavage.

18:47.078 --> 18:49.119
Lavage. Peritoneal lavage.

18:49.332 --> 18:51.242
Oui. Oui. Lavage. Oui.

18:51.418 --> 18:52.747
Why don't you sit down?

18:52.920 --> 18:55.211
- What's that?
- Practice your suturing on this.

18:55.424 --> 18:56.705
- A pig's foot?
- Yeah.

18:56.926 --> 18:58.801
Okay. Which ones?

18:59.013 --> 19:01.505
Running, vertical, interrupted,
deep dermal?

19:01.683 --> 19:03.143
Why don't you try all of them?

19:03.311 --> 19:05.637
- This won't be but a moment.
- All right.

19:05.856 --> 19:07.185
Hey, Mark.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.193
Hey, welcome back. How'd it go?

19:09.362 --> 19:13.147
It's a long drive from Flagstaff in an
old Cadillac, but it was nice to be alone.

19:13.325 --> 19:14.702
- Where's Carol?
- I don't know.

19:14.870 --> 19:16.495
Are we glad to see you!

19:16.705 --> 19:20.290
Otitis, rhinitis, and gastroenteritis.

19:20.461 --> 19:21.624
It's nice to be loved.

19:21.796 --> 19:23.790
Hey, Doug! Hello.

19:24.007 --> 19:25.289
How are you?

19:25.468 --> 19:29.171
Good. I'll get right to work on these.
It's good to see all of you.

19:32.312 --> 19:33.855
Hi. You all done?

19:34.064 --> 19:35.856
Yeah. System's up.

19:36.777 --> 19:39.447
I usually don't get so hands-on
with patients anymore.

19:39.656 --> 19:43.323
I'd prefer blood on my shirt
to a staff mutiny any day.

19:43.495 --> 19:46.332
It sounds like you could use
a little R and R.

19:47.333 --> 19:51.120
- How does a week in St. Barth sound?
- St. Barth's? In the Caribbean?

19:51.340 --> 19:53.167
Synergix conference
is there next week.

19:53.384 --> 19:57.764
You could give a paper
on inner-city ER management.

19:57.975 --> 20:00.763
- We'd take care of your expenses.
- Why?

20:02.189 --> 20:05.725
A doctor with leadership qualities
is a very valuable asset.

20:08.532 --> 20:10.691
It's a real offer.
You think about it.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.737
I will. Thanks.

20:13.205 --> 20:14.998
I'll be at the Ritz-Carlton.

20:15.416 --> 20:16.912
Okay.

20:20.633 --> 20:21.878
Hey, Doug.

20:22.051 --> 20:24.128
How was it meeting
your father's in-laws?

20:24.304 --> 20:26.382
I'm glad I did it. But it was hard.

20:26.557 --> 20:29.595
Sherry's death hit them really bad.
That was her name, Sherry.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.387
I'd like you to see a depressed
anhedonic girl...

20:32.566 --> 20:36.483
...complaining of loss of appetite
and insomnia. She's in Exam Room 3.

20:36.656 --> 20:39.493
- Did Psych look at her?
- I'd like you to evaluate her first.

20:39.661 --> 20:40.741
Good to see you, doc.

20:40.912 --> 20:43.072
I feel like I never left.

20:47.964 --> 20:49.341
Hey.

20:50.301 --> 20:51.677
What?

20:52.387 --> 20:54.346
Mark Greene.

20:55.141 --> 20:57.016
Come here, you.

20:58.605 --> 21:02.474
So you've had a loss of appetite
and insomnia because of me?

21:03.321 --> 21:05.991
- I'm surprised I lived.
- Oh, it sounds serious.

21:07.451 --> 21:09.325
- Shut up and kiss me.
- Okay.

21:12.458 --> 21:15.129
Carol, do I collate
these clinic charts-?

21:16.256 --> 21:17.455
Oops!

21:18.592 --> 21:20.254
Excuse me.

21:26.980 --> 21:28.475
Doc, what do you think?

21:28.649 --> 21:29.894
Hey, not bad.

21:30.068 --> 21:32.227
- I love that running stitch.
- That looks good.

21:32.404 --> 21:34.944
If the police need evidence,
like a blood test...

21:35.158 --> 21:37.698
...and the patient refuses to give it,
what do I do?

21:38.037 --> 21:41.242
Medical personnel can decline
to collect physical evidence...

21:41.418 --> 21:43.246
...where the subject is unconscious...

21:43.463 --> 21:47.961
...or indicates his or her refusal
to consent to the procedure.

21:48.178 --> 21:50.255
The People versus O' Neal, 1993.

21:50.473 --> 21:53.095
- Herb Spivak.
- John Carter. Thank you, Dr. Spivak.

21:53.310 --> 21:54.935
- You need a consult?
- He doesn't.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.516
Herb, that was not very low-profile.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.861
- I was being a lawyer. Big deal.
- Offering a consult?

22:02.073 --> 22:04.446
- Why don't you start practicing your-
- I'm ready!

22:04.618 --> 22:05.995
Jeanie.

22:06.871 --> 22:10.823
If Yosh needs a doctor, he can
ask for one. I'll be right in.

22:11.045 --> 22:12.705
- I cannot allow this.
- Okay.

22:12.880 --> 22:13.912
What are you doing?

22:14.091 --> 22:15.835
I'm logging the fact that at 2:30...

22:16.010 --> 22:18.383
...I was prohibited
from treating an ankle injury.

22:18.555 --> 22:19.885
Chuny, call Security.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.511
- It's Anspaugh.
- Finally!

22:21.727 --> 22:24.433
No. It's not for you.
He wants to talk to Jeanie.

22:27.736 --> 22:29.230
Yes?

22:29.404 --> 22:30.734
All right. I'll be right up.

22:35.288 --> 22:37.448
I'm gonna take this tube out now.

22:37.750 --> 22:40.836
Blood alcohol's pretty high, 270.

22:41.172 --> 22:44.044
- Is she coming around?
- Yeah. She's perking up.

22:44.427 --> 22:46.467
Since she puked.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.892
Let's see.

22:50.352 --> 22:51.764
No pill fragments, though.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.433
Here comes that cop.

22:54.442 --> 22:56.435
Here's your warrant.
Now, draw the blood.

22:56.653 --> 22:59.359
- Let me read it first.
- I want her stomach contents too.

22:59.574 --> 23:01.568
Does that warrant specify
stomach contents?

23:01.744 --> 23:04.996
- It doesn't matter. Give it here.
- Oh, no, you don't.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.838
That's destroying evidence, pal.

23:11.049 --> 23:13.257
- You're under arrest.
- You can't arrest me.

23:13.470 --> 23:15.546
- What? You can't arrest him.
- Watch me.

23:15.723 --> 23:17.432
You have the right to remain silent.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.261
- Where are you taking him?
- Jail.

23:19.437 --> 23:22.273
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Carter's getting arrested.

23:22.441 --> 23:23.852
- Anything you say-
- For what?

23:24.026 --> 23:26.399
For protecting
the doctor/patient privilege.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.491
- If you can't afford-
- Dr. Carter's an inexperienced intern.

23:29.660 --> 23:32.496
If he did anything rashly-
Carter, what did you do?

23:32.664 --> 23:34.741
I stood up for my patient's
civil liberties.

23:35.627 --> 23:38.166
Don't worry. This'll be
taken care of in no time.

23:38.339 --> 23:39.799
So, what's the charge?

23:40.259 --> 23:42.051
Obstruction of justice.

23:43.013 --> 23:44.128
Head.

23:56.199 --> 24:00.946
Her HIV status defines Miss Boulet
as a person in a protected class.

24:01.248 --> 24:05.248
And her firing constitutes
an adverse action by the hospital.

24:05.421 --> 24:07.046
Her layoff was budgetary.

24:07.257 --> 24:09.084
We would argue that was pretext.

24:09.259 --> 24:11.752
And ignoring your progressive
disciplinary policy...

24:11.930 --> 24:16.179
...and firing an exemplary employee
after one incident...

24:16.395 --> 24:19.564
...proves discriminatory intent.

24:23.321 --> 24:26.240
- Take a seat, Kerry.
- I don't want to take a seat.

24:30.082 --> 24:33.287
If you're reinstated,
you'll let the matter drop?

24:33.504 --> 24:34.583
Yes.

24:39.053 --> 24:40.548
Well...

24:41.557 --> 24:43.217
We'll have an answer for you today.

24:43.434 --> 24:45.476
We appreciate your time.

24:51.947 --> 24:53.656
We can't cave in to this.

24:53.867 --> 24:54.946
It's blackmail.

24:56.538 --> 24:59.659
Our only option is to hire her back.

24:59.876 --> 25:02.582
The media would swarm all over
a federal case like this.

25:02.755 --> 25:05.508
You pushed me to make the cutback.
What about the budget?

25:05.676 --> 25:08.880
A P.A.'s salary is nothing compared
to the risk of the countless...

25:09.055 --> 25:12.508
...pain-and-emotional-suffering
lawsuits from patients she treated.

25:12.686 --> 25:14.845
Do you know what this will do
to my authority?

25:15.022 --> 25:17.266
Well, you're strong, Kerry.

25:18.152 --> 25:19.232
You'll survive.

25:22.033 --> 25:24.870
This femoral defect measures
at least 13 centimeters.

25:25.079 --> 25:27.287
We're pushing the envelope
on fibular transfer.

25:27.458 --> 25:28.657
She's throwing PVCs.

25:28.876 --> 25:31.203
I'll push fluids and start lidocaine.

25:32.214 --> 25:35.133
Remove the distal clamp from
the femoral artery. Slowly.

25:36.221 --> 25:39.307
All right. It's back-filled.
The anastomosis looks dry.

25:39.517 --> 25:41.890
- Excellent.
- Does she know about her mother?

25:42.063 --> 25:44.139
No. She was put under
before her mom died.

25:44.399 --> 25:46.227
Poor girl. Okay, release proximally.

25:46.903 --> 25:49.822
All right. Arterial flow's restored.
Toes are pinking up.

25:50.032 --> 25:52.738
Pressure's heading south.
M.A.P.'s down to 70.

25:52.953 --> 25:55.956
- Maybe we should bail.
- I'm almost there. Let's finish.

25:56.584 --> 25:59.705
Give her two more units of
packed cells. Let's pick it up.

25:59.922 --> 26:01.583
- Pick up.
- Metz.

26:04.178 --> 26:06.967
- Here's the police district phone number.
- Great. Thanks.

26:07.141 --> 26:10.013
My daughter's getting dropped off
for a dental appointment.

26:10.187 --> 26:13.522
- Can you find me when she's here?
- Rachel? I can't wait to meet her.

26:14.068 --> 26:15.563
All right. Call me back then.

26:15.779 --> 26:16.942
- Is that Legal?
- Yeah.

26:17.114 --> 26:19.024
- What did they say?
- They're finding out.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.075
It's not every day
interns are arrested.

26:21.245 --> 26:22.824
Cop's leaving. She's all ours.

26:23.039 --> 26:24.582
What happened?

26:26.962 --> 26:28.919
Oh, baby, please forgive me!

26:29.215 --> 26:30.794
It's never gonna happen again.

26:30.968 --> 26:34.006
- You almost killed me.
- Carter went to jail for this?

26:34.223 --> 26:37.675
My foot hit the gas. You know
how crazy I get when we fight.

26:42.109 --> 26:43.485
Is this really necessary?

26:43.694 --> 26:45.854
Let's say it's a tradition.

26:46.365 --> 26:48.939
Superintendent Rodriguez
is a family friend.

26:49.161 --> 26:51.949
Give him a call, I'm sure we can
clear up this misunderstanding.

26:52.165 --> 26:53.791
Over here.

26:55.712 --> 26:58.204
Don't I get a phone call?
I get a phone call.

26:58.424 --> 27:01.760
- Just a blindfold and a cigarette.
- What?

27:01.930 --> 27:04.386
You'll get everything.
Don't worry. Look here.

27:05.852 --> 27:07.051
No smiling.

27:08.981 --> 27:10.311
- Hey, Doug.
- What's going on?

27:10.484 --> 27:12.477
The sickle cell guy
Weaver turfed is back.

27:12.654 --> 27:15.276
I can't tell if he's a junkie
or he's in a real crisis.

27:15.449 --> 27:18.368
- Okay. All right.
- Get a doctor in here!

27:20.164 --> 27:21.909
I'm in pain! Hurry up!

27:23.252 --> 27:25.460
I'm Dr. Ross.
Get his vitals and start an IV.

27:25.672 --> 27:27.298
Sit back here, will you?

27:27.801 --> 27:29.212
Will you give me
some Demerol?

27:29.512 --> 27:30.841
Is that what works for you?

27:31.056 --> 27:32.599
Yeah! Nobody here believes me.

27:33.017 --> 27:35.260
What do you think
caused this crisis?

27:35.604 --> 27:38.606
I don't know. I'm stressed.
I'm trying to get home...

27:39.860 --> 27:42.862
...to KC for my sister's wedding.
Somebody stole my pain pills.

27:43.073 --> 27:45.779
- Did they take everything?
- Yeah, they took everything.

27:45.952 --> 27:48.623
Will you give me some Demerol, please?

27:48.831 --> 27:50.410
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

27:50.626 --> 27:52.620
I'll make you better.
But we'll do it my way.

27:52.838 --> 27:53.870
Vitals are normal.

27:54.090 --> 27:58.635
Start an IV, 5 of Dilaudid, 3 every 10
minutes till he doesn't feel any pain.

27:58.805 --> 28:01.213
While she's medicating you,
we'll try something.

28:01.434 --> 28:05.303
All right? Close your eyes. Think
of a place that makes you feel calm.

28:05.482 --> 28:06.810
Come on, man!

28:06.983 --> 28:09.654
I'm trusting you.
You gotta trust me, okay?

28:09.863 --> 28:12.152
- Close your eyes. Think of a place.
- All right.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.367
Think of a place...

28:15.371 --> 28:17.079
My granny's kitchen.

28:17.290 --> 28:18.619
Okay, good.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.288
- Close them.
- I can't do this.

28:21.463 --> 28:23.207
- Yes, you can.
- No.

28:23.674 --> 28:25.668
- Breathe slowly.
- It hurts.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.171
All right.

28:31.936 --> 28:32.969
Any word on Carter?

28:33.147 --> 28:36.732
Dr. Greene said the hospital lawyers
can't even find out where he is.

28:41.117 --> 28:45.911
You have your position back retroactive
to your clock-in time this morning.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.621
Then I'll get back to work.

28:49.963 --> 28:52.882
- Hand lac in the Suture Room for you.
- Thank you.

28:53.051 --> 28:55.590
- Let me know if you need anything.
- I will.

28:55.805 --> 28:58.511
You know and I know this was not
about your HIV status.

28:58.684 --> 29:00.013
Do I?

29:00.395 --> 29:03.314
- The last pin is seated.
- Can we get out now?

29:04.568 --> 29:07.570
- What's going on?
- I don't know. She's de-satting.

29:08.239 --> 29:11.029
Pulse ox is down to 92 on 100 percent.

29:11.453 --> 29:13.078
Ex-fix is on. Bring her up.

29:13.289 --> 29:15.247
- Cut the anesthetic.
- Run of eight.

29:16.252 --> 29:17.877
Damn. Fifty of lidocaine.

29:18.088 --> 29:19.997
- T-waves have flipped.
- Bottom's falling out.

29:20.174 --> 29:21.634
Pulse ox, 88.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.963
She's crumping!
She's in fib! Crash cart!

29:25.140 --> 29:27.893
Charge it to 200.
Let's move! Come on!

29:28.728 --> 29:29.760
Off!

29:31.941 --> 29:33.770
300! Off!

29:34.111 --> 29:36.189
We got to crack her chest
and get to that embolus.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.782
360. Off!

29:37.950 --> 29:40.276
- Forget it, Peter.
- Lizzie, start CPR.

29:41.831 --> 29:43.029
Get on it, Corday!

29:43.416 --> 29:45.291
Sternal saw! Sternal saw!

29:51.845 --> 29:53.389
She's out.

29:54.140 --> 29:56.134
Let me provide
the countertraction, Mark.

29:56.353 --> 29:57.681
I want a nurse to do it.

29:57.896 --> 30:00.567
Let me just hold her arm
while you reduce it.

30:00.942 --> 30:03.481
Mark, come on.
I'm not getting anything.

30:03.696 --> 30:06.188
We had a deal.
You're not giving me anything.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.904
All right. Grab her arm.

30:09.705 --> 30:12.458
Now, just hold the arm tight
while I pull.

30:12.668 --> 30:13.996
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

30:14.170 --> 30:15.499
And go.

30:16.632 --> 30:18.709
It popped right back in.
What did you do?

30:18.886 --> 30:20.713
Did you pronate and externally rotate?

30:21.514 --> 30:22.629
In-line traction.

30:22.807 --> 30:25.513
- Mark, Rachel's at the desk.
- Oh, right.

30:25.854 --> 30:28.227
Can you order post-reduction films
on Mrs. Miller?

30:28.399 --> 30:29.728
Got it.

30:29.902 --> 30:33.438
- What happened to Jeanie?
- Dr. Anspaugh gave her her job back.

30:33.907 --> 30:37.028
- How does Kerry feel about that?
- She's pissed.

30:41.043 --> 30:42.917
Hi, sweetheart. So you two have met?

30:43.129 --> 30:44.624
We're old friends by now.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.962
How could she be wearing the jodhpurs
with that bubble-butt?

30:48.178 --> 30:51.383
Maybe she has a bell that dings
whenever she backs up.

30:51.558 --> 30:52.590
You mean like this?

30:52.810 --> 30:54.934
Ding! Ding!

30:55.439 --> 30:57.017
I think she looks hip.

30:57.233 --> 30:58.514
Oh, yeah?

30:58.819 --> 31:00.646
Dad, you're real hip.

31:05.244 --> 31:07.155
Cynthia, when do you get off work?

31:07.373 --> 31:09.283
Oh, about 10 minutes.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.420
Is there any way you could run
Rachel to the dentist?

31:12.589 --> 31:14.463
I gotta follow up
on this Carter thing.

31:14.675 --> 31:16.715
Is that all right, Rach?
Thank you.

31:16.928 --> 31:18.673
Maybe we'll go window-shopping.

31:18.849 --> 31:22.634
- Where are you going with that chart?
- I got the perfect patient for me.

31:22.854 --> 31:25.180
Three-and-a-half-inch scalp lac
on a sleeping transient.

31:25.399 --> 31:26.943
Isn't that where you all start?

31:27.152 --> 31:30.274
I'll tell you what. I'll suture him
and you can cut my knots.

31:30.491 --> 31:31.771
Let me sew a little bit.

31:31.951 --> 31:33.327
You're not a doctor, Herb.

31:33.537 --> 31:35.197
But you saw what I did-

31:37.208 --> 31:39.286
Mr. Deindorfer! Mr. Deindorfer!

31:39.503 --> 31:40.963
We got a code blue in Exam 4!

31:41.131 --> 31:43.124
- Looks like a V-fib.
- Grab that red cart.

31:43.342 --> 31:44.754
A defibrillator coming up.

31:47.223 --> 31:48.303
200. Clear!

31:50.811 --> 31:52.141
Herb!

31:58.198 --> 31:59.609
Wow! What happened?

32:00.701 --> 32:02.493
You're gonna be okay, Mr. D!

32:04.708 --> 32:05.739
Unbelievable!

32:09.882 --> 32:11.590
Jeanie! Jeanie!

32:12.427 --> 32:16.094
What's going on? They told me
in the ER that you were working today.

32:16.266 --> 32:19.268
I've been rehired, Al.
We're gonna get caught up.

32:19.478 --> 32:20.808
I got the call from Atlanta.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.307
Six months on the high-rise job
starting Tuesday.

32:23.526 --> 32:24.607
But I got my job back.

32:24.820 --> 32:28.107
Tell them to shove it because
we're moving to Atlanta.

32:28.283 --> 32:31.321
- We need to talk about this.
- We'll have plenty of time to talk.

32:31.496 --> 32:33.869
I fought hard for this job.
It means a lot to me.

32:36.254 --> 32:39.458
You don't believe my job is real.
You got no faith in me.

32:39.675 --> 32:40.921
Al, it's not about that.

32:41.136 --> 32:44.637
Yes, it is. It's about you not
being able to depend on me.

32:45.433 --> 32:47.972
You won't tell anyone in Atlanta
about our HIV status?

32:48.187 --> 32:49.469
It's nobody's business.

32:49.690 --> 32:52.776
- I'm not running away.
- You have a life here, and I don't.

32:54.321 --> 32:57.074
Don't you see what making this
fresh start means to me?

32:57.785 --> 33:00.491
Don't you see what getting my job back
means to me?

33:06.673 --> 33:08.251
I gotta go pack.

33:08.843 --> 33:10.469
I'll see you at home later.

33:14.309 --> 33:15.805
Mr. Carter.

33:18.900 --> 33:21.606
- Doctor Carter?
- Excuse the hell out of me.

33:21.779 --> 33:24.816
No, no, no. You know,
just for accuracy's sake.

33:25.033 --> 33:26.362
I get my one phone call now?

33:26.577 --> 33:30.114
As you're in on a misdemeanor offense,
we're waiving the fingerprint check.

33:30.291 --> 33:32.499
- You can bond right out.
- Oh, thank God!

33:32.712 --> 33:34.788
- What do I have to do?
- $100 and you're out.

33:34.965 --> 33:38.834
Great. My credit cards are in my wallet,
which is in that box over there.

33:39.013 --> 33:43.142
We don't take credit cards.
It's cash and carry, doctor.

33:46.106 --> 33:47.482
That's all I got.

33:47.733 --> 33:51.435
That was an unbelievable feeling, the
power of life and death in my hands.

33:51.656 --> 33:54.693
Are you trying to get me fired?
Forget the deal, okay?

33:54.911 --> 33:56.239
- It worked!
- Cool it, Herb!

33:56.454 --> 33:59.991
Randi's getting Anspaugh on the phone.
Could you talk to him about Carter?

34:00.168 --> 34:01.580
- Sure.
- Somebody's in jail?

34:01.754 --> 34:04.591
- Are you a doctor?
- No. Herb Spivak. I'm a lawyer.

34:04.758 --> 34:07.512
One of our interns was arrested
for destroying evidence.

34:07.721 --> 34:11.091
It's no problem. Get a bail bondsman.
He'll be out in the morning.

34:11.560 --> 34:14.895
By the way, Mark, your lawsuit's gone.

34:15.440 --> 34:18.147
- What?
- That's right. Sayonara, kaputo.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.147
I just got off the phone
with Mickey Everett...

34:20.322 --> 34:22.197
...the attorney for the Law family.

34:22.367 --> 34:24.445
- We convinced them to drop charges.
- Really?

34:24.621 --> 34:26.413
You'll have papers drawn up
in a week.

34:26.581 --> 34:27.993
How'd you pull that off?

34:28.208 --> 34:30.168
Mickey Everett and I are part...

34:30.379 --> 34:33.132
...of a billion-dollar
class action against big tobacco.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.543
We're looking at
a 10-million-dollar legal fee.

34:35.762 --> 34:39.596
Nobody's pushing away from that golden
goose until it's plucked clean.

34:40.018 --> 34:42.427
Mark, can I have this as a memento?

34:42.647 --> 34:43.846
Sure, you can have it.

34:44.065 --> 34:46.391
That's the doctor who saved my life!
Thank you.

34:46.612 --> 34:48.154
- You're welcome.
- You got class.

34:48.322 --> 34:50.315
Yeah. Take care. You look great.

34:50.492 --> 34:52.866
Unbelievable.
Medicine, that's a calling.

34:53.080 --> 34:56.532
Listen, Mark, Morton's some night
for a steak. On me.

34:56.751 --> 34:58.544
Thanks for a thrilling day.

35:03.845 --> 35:05.090
Mark?

35:05.263 --> 35:07.305
- Jen.
- Did Rachel have any cavities?

35:07.517 --> 35:09.427
Cynthia's not back yet. She took her.

35:09.645 --> 35:11.853
But we can wait for them
in the lounge.

35:12.065 --> 35:14.355
- Cynthia?
- She's the new desk clerk.

35:14.569 --> 35:17.026
She likes kids.
Rachel gets along great with her.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.320
So she took her.

35:18.534 --> 35:21.868
- The appointment was a while ago.
- They'll be back any minute.

35:23.248 --> 35:24.743
Oh, my God!

35:25.794 --> 35:28.880
Me and Cyn went to Makeovers
across the street from the dentist.

35:29.049 --> 35:31.172
I got my nails done,
and my toes too.

35:31.385 --> 35:34.673
And she wanted her eyebrow pierced.
But I said, " No way. "

35:37.269 --> 35:39.227
This is Cynthia.
And this is Jennifer.

35:39.439 --> 35:41.231
- Rachel's mom.
- Hi.

35:42.652 --> 35:44.064
It's just temporary.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.905
All the teenagers are doing it.

35:46.115 --> 35:47.491
She's 8.

35:49.036 --> 35:50.911
Well, it'll wash out.

35:52.041 --> 35:53.583
Come on, Rachel.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.534
Come on.

35:56.881 --> 35:58.045
Bye, sweetheart.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.884
I was sick of that little-girl hair.

36:04.893 --> 36:06.887
Oh, Mark. I'm so...

36:07.105 --> 36:09.727
I'm so sorry.
We were just having so much fun.

36:09.942 --> 36:12.980
And you liked it when I showed it
to you in the magazine.

36:13.196 --> 36:14.989
Oh, it's okay. Really.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.445
You're not mad at me?

36:16.660 --> 36:18.036
No.

36:19.205 --> 36:23.704
So we're still on for a lingerie show
and margaritas tonight?

36:23.921 --> 36:28.300
You know, I kind of need to give my
liver just one night to regenerate.

36:28.469 --> 36:30.795
- So I'll take a rain check.
- Hey, Mark?

36:32.016 --> 36:33.511
What are we doing about Carter?

36:33.685 --> 36:36.224
I called a bail bondsman.
They'll release him in the morning.

36:36.397 --> 36:37.976
He has to stay in jail all night?

36:38.192 --> 36:39.521
You want to call the family?

36:39.694 --> 36:41.604
And say, "John Carter
the 3rd's in jail"?

36:41.822 --> 36:43.697
Here's the police district
phone number.

36:43.867 --> 36:45.492
- I'll deal with it.
- Thank you.

36:45.661 --> 36:48.283
Here's enough oral Dilaudid to get you
to your sister's wedding.

36:48.498 --> 36:51.287
- Great. Thanks a lot.
- All right. You're welcome.

36:56.969 --> 36:58.595
Damn it! Hey!

36:59.640 --> 37:02.891
- What's he doing back here?
- It's not your concern. He's my patient.

37:03.062 --> 37:04.770
You don't help an addict
by giving him drugs.

37:04.981 --> 37:06.690
That's a sickle cell patient in pain.

37:06.901 --> 37:08.811
A drug-seeker who's
learned to manipulate-

37:08.987 --> 37:11.313
He cannot function
without painkillers.

37:11.532 --> 37:15.698
People live in pain.
They suck it up and get past it.

37:18.959 --> 37:20.371
What's up with her?

37:20.546 --> 37:23.418
I think the crown is weighing heavily
on the queen's head.

37:30.184 --> 37:31.561
Mark?

37:32.731 --> 37:34.141
Hi.

37:34.733 --> 37:36.144
I'm so sorry.

37:36.569 --> 37:40.355
I just really wanted to make it
special for Rachel, and I...

37:40.617 --> 37:42.990
- ... made a mess of it.
- It's okay.

37:43.162 --> 37:44.491
Your ex-wife hates me.

37:44.706 --> 37:46.415
No. She was just...

37:46.626 --> 37:48.168
She was shocked.

37:48.378 --> 37:49.410
So were you.

37:50.214 --> 37:51.958
Yeah. I guess I was.

37:54.596 --> 37:58.677
Rachel's really happy
and really sure of herself.

37:58.893 --> 38:00.388
You must be a really great dad.

38:01.189 --> 38:03.396
- I don't know about that.
- No. You are.

38:05.152 --> 38:06.897
I was really excited about tonight.

38:07.656 --> 38:09.365
I wore your present and everything.

38:10.076 --> 38:11.406
My feet are killing me.

38:41.622 --> 38:42.999
So you're a doctor?

38:44.418 --> 38:45.795
Yes. Yes, I am.

38:51.512 --> 38:54.468
So what are you in for?

38:54.642 --> 38:56.516
Shrike? Is that your name?

38:56.686 --> 38:57.719
Shrike?

38:57.980 --> 38:59.225
Obstruction of justice.

39:00.317 --> 39:03.236
Yeah? Me too.
How about that, huh?

39:03.822 --> 39:05.982
I was expecting something
a little bit...

39:06.201 --> 39:08.740
No, no, no. I'm not
making any snap judgments.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.078
- I got something for you.
- You do?

39:12.335 --> 39:13.497
What's this red bump?

39:17.509 --> 39:19.383
That's a nasty carbuncle.

39:21.806 --> 39:23.183
May I?

39:24.352 --> 39:25.384
Yeah.

39:25.562 --> 39:26.938
Pants up, ladies.

39:27.607 --> 39:31.393
Come on, Carter.
Your other girlfriend bailed you out.

39:31.989 --> 39:33.364
I got a girlfriend.

39:34.033 --> 39:35.408
I guess I gotta go.

39:36.578 --> 39:39.996
Just soak that in warm soapy water
about four times a day.

39:40.209 --> 39:41.620
It should clear right up.

39:41.836 --> 39:43.248
Girlfriend?

39:47.427 --> 39:48.757
Anna?

39:49.139 --> 39:51.097
Hi, knucklehead.

39:51.308 --> 39:52.637
Thank God!

39:57.484 --> 40:01.483
Sorry. I was wondering what
I should get you for Christmas.

40:01.698 --> 40:03.242
It finally came to me. Bail!

40:04.369 --> 40:07.574
I thought I was gonna be spending
the weekend in there with Shrike.

40:07.749 --> 40:10.241
Did you get Darlene into the home?

40:10.419 --> 40:11.666
Yeah. She...

40:11.880 --> 40:13.423
She did try to kill him.

40:14.008 --> 40:16.583
But they kissed and made up
and went home...

40:16.804 --> 40:19.011
...and lived happily ever after.

40:19.224 --> 40:22.227
- I should've had lunch with my cousin.
- I know what you mean.

40:23.105 --> 40:26.855
I'm noticing it's kind of expensive
to have a rich guy for a friend.

40:29.365 --> 40:31.773
- Hey.
- Hello.

40:31.952 --> 40:35.368
English Breakfast. You know,
I figured since you were English.

40:35.581 --> 40:37.207
It's perfect.

40:37.710 --> 40:39.668
Why aren't you at home
putting your son to sleep?

40:39.838 --> 40:41.297
I get him on the weekends.

40:41.507 --> 40:43.133
So how's Allison?

40:43.761 --> 40:47.629
Well, her parameters are stable.
But she's still comatose.

40:47.808 --> 40:49.801
She hasn't so much as twitched.

40:51.355 --> 40:55.401
You made the right decision for a lady
who has a lifetime ahead of her.

40:56.112 --> 40:58.105
I ask myself whether
I made the decision...

40:58.281 --> 41:01.070
...based on my lust
for challenging surgery.

41:02.705 --> 41:06.574
Yeah. I ask myself that same question
all the time.

41:07.837 --> 41:11.789
You know, where does wanting to help
end and ambition begin?

41:14.764 --> 41:16.508
There's the rub.

42:05.004 --> 42:06.416
Jeanie.

42:12.473 --> 42:15.013
I just went to gas up the car.

42:15.227 --> 42:16.771
I thought you'd gone.

42:20.528 --> 42:23.731
Say the word and I'll
pack your stuff too.

42:26.244 --> 42:27.703
I can't, Al.

42:29.331 --> 42:30.708
My life is here.

42:32.294 --> 42:33.920
My job is here.

42:34.256 --> 42:36.380
I've worked too hard.
I can't just walk away.

42:36.551 --> 42:39.838
Come on. I mean, all the abuse
they put you through.

42:40.056 --> 42:44.138
I know. But it's made me realize
who I am and what I want.

42:45.731 --> 42:47.724
I can't tell lies anymore.

42:50.321 --> 42:51.947
We've been through a lot.

42:53.993 --> 42:55.488
Can't just...

42:56.580 --> 42:57.861
...throw that away.

43:00.169 --> 43:02.328
You've always been able
to make me laugh...

43:04.049 --> 43:06.886
...make my head spin like
when we were teenagers.

43:09.348 --> 43:10.927
Yeah. Well...

43:12.812 --> 43:14.142
Give it some time.

43:18.278 --> 43:20.356
See what it feels like.

43:46.486 --> 43:48.196
I'll call...

43:49.699 --> 43:50.780
...when I get there.

43:50.952 --> 43:52.577
You do that.

44:01.926 --> 44:03.586
Take care.
