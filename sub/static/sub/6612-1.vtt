00:18.936 --> 00:21.896
On my first day of law school,
my professor says two things.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.066
First, "From this day forward,
when your mother says she loves you,

00:25.150 --> 00:27.860
- "get a second opinion."
- And?

00:27.945 --> 00:29.946
"If you want justice,
go to a whorehouse.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.698
"If you want to get fucked, go to court."

00:32.783 --> 00:33.741
Naomi!

00:33.826 --> 00:35.952
Let's say you have a client
who you know is guilty...

00:36.036 --> 00:37.537
No, don't even start with that.

00:37.621 --> 00:40.248
Our justice system doesn't care
about that, and neither do I.

00:40.332 --> 00:43.042
Every defendant, no matter who he is,
regardless of what he's done,

00:43.127 --> 00:46.087
has the right to the best defense
his attorney can provide. Period.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.548
- So where were you with the truth?
- Truth?

00:50.676 --> 00:53.219
- How do you mean? Naomi!
- Coming.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.222
I'm not sure how many ways
there are to mean it.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.432
You think there's only one?

00:57.516 --> 00:58.933
- I can't do this.
- You're late.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.810
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.687
Actually, you're right, you know.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.772
- There is only one that matters.
- Marty, hold still, please.

01:04.857 --> 01:05.982
My version of it,

01:06.066 --> 01:09.652
the one I create in the minds of those
12 men and women sitting on a jury.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.821
Now, if you want to,
you can call it something else.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.950
The... The illusion of truth, if you want.
It's up to you.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.286
- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:20.164 --> 01:21.873
Jack, is that it?
You need some more stuff?

01:21.957 --> 01:23.291
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow afternoon?

01:23.375 --> 01:26.836
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll have my secretary set it up.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.045
Okay.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.219
- This is a cover story, right?
- Yeah.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.929
Yeah. Okay, bye.

03:41.513 --> 03:44.265
Saint Michael's Boys Choir.
Thank you. Thank you.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.392
- What a talented group.
- Tell you after.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.019
- Sure.
- Right now, ladies and gentlemen,

03:48.103 --> 03:49.812
we're gonna have a brief photo session

03:49.897 --> 03:52.398
while we have the boys here
with His Excellency.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.983
I'll be back in a few minutes.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.194
Please bear with us,
enjoy your dessert and thank you.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.488
- Yes.
- Here we go. Okay.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.952
Good, good.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.249
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.375
Thank you.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.765
Thanks.
Marty. What an unexpected surprise.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.643
Well, I'm here to help
our friendly prosecutor off the hook.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.187
- Excuse me.
- What's it gonna cost?

04:31.855 --> 04:36.442
- A lot less than the alternative.
- Tomorrow at my office, 9:30.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.198
- Is this on? Yes, it is.
- Your Excellency. Nice to see you again.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.409
Ladies and gentlemen, we have come
to the heart of the matter,

04:45.494 --> 04:47.995
the reason we've all
gathered together here tonight.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.957
This is the fifth straight year
that it's been my privilege

04:51.041 --> 04:52.959
to serve as your master of ceremonies

04:53.043 --> 04:55.753
for The Chicago Bar Association
and Catholic Charities Ball.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.214
I'm afraid
you're gonna have to put that out.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.549
It's a bar, for Christ's sake.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.261
Tonight, due to your generous efforts,

05:04.346 --> 05:07.306
we've broken last year's record
in terms of attendees and the amount

05:07.391 --> 05:09.308
- of money raised for the Archbishop's...
- I thought you quit.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.810
- ...charity, and I think that deserves...
- I cut down.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.395
...a big round of applause.

05:13.271 --> 05:18.067
- You look beautiful. Cut your hair?
- Yeah. A few months ago.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.820
And now, as it has been my pleasure
for the last four years...

05:20.904 --> 05:24.699
- Want to dance?
- There isn't any music.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.867
Sure there is.

05:26.952 --> 05:31.080
...longtime State's Attorney,
God love him, Mr. John Shaughnessy.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.340
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen,

05:41.425 --> 05:43.342
- and my personal thanks...
- Come on.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.177
All you have to do is turn around.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.346
I thought you liked it better like this.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.182
That way you don't have to look
at the person.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.434
Mean.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.602
Considering the hour, I'll try to keep...

05:53.687 --> 05:55.104
Look at me.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.523
First of all, I want to thank all of you
for coming out tonight

05:57.607 --> 05:59.358
to support the Archbishop...

05:59.443 --> 06:03.112
Come on, let's go find a bar
you can still smoke in.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.697
Thanks for the invite,

06:04.781 --> 06:08.284
but I don't like one-night stands
all that much.

06:08.368 --> 06:12.955
- We saw each other for months.
- It was a one-night stand, Marty.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.125
It just lasted six months.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.053
Thank you, John.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.972
Well, I must say

06:30.057 --> 06:33.392
I haven't seen this many lawyers
and politicians

06:33.477 --> 06:36.562
gathered together in one place
since confession this morning.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.868
There is no way
the People are gonna tolerate

06:50.952 --> 06:55.081
a monetary award to a cockroach
who deserves 20 to life.

06:55.165 --> 06:59.418
He may be your client,
but Joey Pinero is a hard-case felon.

06:59.503 --> 07:00.586
Dealing, racketeering,

07:00.670 --> 07:04.048
- money-laundering, attempted murder.
- Did you say "alleged," Yancy?

07:04.132 --> 07:06.425
I didn't hear you say...
Did you hear him say "alleged"?

07:06.510 --> 07:08.886
Mr. Pinero has never been
convicted of anything.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.971
Cops jumped him,
left him bleeding in the snow.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.807
It's a miracle he survived.

07:12.891 --> 07:16.143
Having said that,
I'm not opposed to a settlement.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.107
1 .5 million, and Pinero leaves the state.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.198
You can't limit a citizen's right to live
wherever he wants to.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.741
Legally, that's unenforceable.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.911
Whether or not it's enforceable
or just a gentlemen's agreement,

07:33.995 --> 07:36.455
Mr. Pinero will know what we want.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.085
Get the answer you're looking for.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.796
Don't sit around and chat.
It's been a pleasure.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.090
You're worse than the fucking thugs
you represent.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.716
That's enough, Bud. It's over.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.011
- Obviously, I've got to run this by him.
- You're on 40 % commission, Marty.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.890
I have nothing but confidence
your recommendation will prevail.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.600
Thank you, John.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.907
My hand!

08:55.785 --> 08:57.119
Oh, shit.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.101
- Hey.
- Mr. Vail.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.686
How you doing?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.326
Nice tune.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.502
So, what'd they say?

10:28.586 --> 10:33.299
Take it or leave it all for 1.5 million.
From Shaughnessy himself.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.052
What do you think?

10:39.681 --> 10:41.348
I think we should take it,

10:41.433 --> 10:42.975
unless you want to spend
the next two years of your life

10:43.059 --> 10:44.226
tied up in appellate court.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.729
- No, fuck that. Close it.
- Done.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.567
Okay.

10:59.576 --> 11:00.909
Your shot.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.788
There's one more little thing.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.793
They want you...
They want you to leave the state.

11:10.253 --> 11:13.422
- They want you to disappear.
- Disappear?

11:15.216 --> 11:19.762
- That's good. Same bullshit, right?
- What? What are you talking about?

11:22.766 --> 11:25.851
I keep getting these offers
from these guys, Marty.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.603
What offers?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.773
Well, a couple of months ago,
a cop walks in here.

11:30.857 --> 11:35.069
He says,
"You testify against Alderman Martinez,

11:35.153 --> 11:37.571
"and we'll owe you, Joey.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.157
"Say he did you favors,
say he's on your payroll,"

11:40.241 --> 11:43.118
shit like that, right?
So I tell him to go fuck himself.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.829
Why? Because Martinez is a good man.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.122
He's the only one holding out

11:47.207 --> 11:50.751
while the others try to turn South River
into high-rent condos.

11:50.835 --> 11:54.129
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- Why?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.382
'Cause this shit happens every day.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.258
I didn't think it had anything
to do with this.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.802
- You don't?
- Hey.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.303
I've spent a lot of money in this place.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.722
- They've spent a lot more, a lot more.
- I built a clinic here.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.600
- These people depend on me.
- I don't give a shit.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.144
Send them checks from California.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.990
I respect your advice, Marty,
but I can't take it.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.742
I'll take the money,
but I ain't going anywhere.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.578
- This is my home.
- I don't like it, Joey.

12:28.289 --> 12:32.167
- So what are they gonna do, kill me?
- They tried once.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.839
How are they going to kill a man
who never sleeps?

12:36.923 --> 12:38.590
- Get the money.
- You're too much.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.926
- Hey.
- Yeah.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.220
That song you like? Fourth cut.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.224
- Very nice, thank you.
- Yeah.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.953
Christ, we got enough
fucking cops here?

13:08.037 --> 13:10.372
No doubt, the police are gonna have
their hands full with this one.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.124
Captain Stenner,
can you tell us anything right now?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.293
I don't know anything. I just got here.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.753
Captain Stenner,
can you tell us what's going on?

13:16.838 --> 13:18.005
Andy, I haven't seen anything yet.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.132
As soon as I go inside,
I'll come out and tell you, okay?

13:20.216 --> 13:21.592
All right.

13:41.029 --> 13:44.198
You should be home in bed, Abel.
It's going around.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.408
I'll consider that, Harvey.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.081
- Christ.
- What a mess, huh?

14:12.936 --> 14:16.396
Sam, you got all you need?
Okay, gently roll him over.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.618
Police! Stop!

14:30.703 --> 14:33.247
Right thumb and forefinger severed.

14:33.331 --> 14:39.795
Symbol "B32.156"
is carved into the chest.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.639
- Body temperature, still warm.
- Captain, we got a live one on the run.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.415
You can see now, a passing train
has separated the fleeing suspect...

15:16.499 --> 15:18.750
You want to know what I hate?
I'll tell you what I hate.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.002
I hate when they go on and on

15:20.086 --> 15:22.170
about what big fucking whores
the defense attorneys are.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.880
...the suspect is headed into the train...

15:23.965 --> 15:26.425
We're the bad guys. You know why?

15:26.509 --> 15:27.843
'Cause we're always sitting
next to some creep,

15:27.927 --> 15:29.595
we start to look creepy, you know?

15:29.679 --> 15:30.804
Plus, they assume they're guilty.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.390
You know, they assume they did it,
and, like, we know or something.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.435
You don't know.
You don't ask. You don't care.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.312
You do the goddamn job.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.439
It's not like they're your friends,
for Christ's sake.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.524
...there's no telling
where the suspect may have gone...

15:42.609 --> 15:45.152
Well, some are your friends, but...

15:55.872 --> 15:57.998
So, why'd you leave
the State's Attorney's Office?

15:58.708 --> 16:00.208
Dead-end job.

16:01.919 --> 16:05.881
You either... You either run for office,
or you end up a judge.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.800
Why become an umpire
when you can play ball?

16:08.885 --> 16:11.845
...continue to pour into the area
around Saint Michael's

16:11.929 --> 16:13.597
and the Archbishop's mansion.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.867
Over here! He's over here!

16:39.374 --> 16:41.583
We will, of course,
stay with this shocking story

16:41.668 --> 16:44.169
as it continues to unfold
throughout the day.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.712
Now, what we do know right now

16:45.797 --> 16:49.007
is that at approximately 11:08
this morning, this...

16:49.092 --> 16:51.635
So, when did you know you had them?

16:51.803 --> 16:54.429
Now, at this hour, the scene
at Saint Michael's is crowded...

16:54.514 --> 16:56.056
- What? Sorry.
- Was there a moment

16:56.140 --> 16:58.308
during the Pinero trial
when you said to yourself,

16:58.393 --> 17:00.018
"I've got them"?

17:01.479 --> 17:03.689
The day I took the case. Excuse me.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.065
...the shocking murder this morning

17:05.148 --> 17:07.608
of one of Chicago's
most beloved figures,

17:07.694 --> 17:11.029
Archbishop Richard Rushman,
has left the city just numb.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.699
Okay, I understand we have Andy live.
Let's go to Andy.

17:13.782 --> 17:14.950
Diann, we have just learned

17:15.034 --> 17:17.703
that Chicago police have arrested
a 19-year-old man

17:17.787 --> 17:20.539
tentatively identified as Aaron Stampler.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.124
Now, according
to Captain Abel Stenner...

17:22.208 --> 17:25.085
We're gonna have to reschedule.
Call my office, okay? I'm sorry.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.046
...underneath McCormick Place
just minutes after the murder...

17:29.966 --> 17:33.510
...through cold-blooded savagery, a
beacon of hope has been taken from us.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.053
Law offices of Martin Vail.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.305
- You got the news on, by any chance?
- Yeah, we're watching it.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.100
All right, I want you to call Sullivan
in Judge Trotter's office.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.685
Find out where they took him,
and call me right back.

17:41.769 --> 17:42.811
I'm at The Alibi.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.980
- A lot of guys are gonna want this one.
- Okay.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.566
The police have taken the first steps,

17:47.650 --> 17:50.026
acting with speed and determination
with the arrest.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.716
Are you taking the Stampler case?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.926
Andy, I'm sorry.
I can't talk to you about anything.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.471
Thank you very much.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.307
When are you gonna talk?

18:21.976 --> 18:24.436
- State's Attorney left yet?
- Yeah. Yancy, no less.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.314
- Yeah? P.D.?
- Come and gone. Lockup!

18:28.649 --> 18:31.526
- Give my best to your brother.
- Yeah, sure.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.655
I'd like to see him alone, if I could.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.199
All right,
but I'm gonna have to lock you in.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.700
Understood.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.647
You know who I am?

19:09.607 --> 19:13.068
Well, no. No, sir. No, I don't.

19:14.070 --> 19:18.573
My name is Martin Vail.
I'm what you call a big-shot attorney.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.536
I don't... I don't have no money.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.120
No, I didn't think you did.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.832
I'm willing to take your case pro bono,

19:26.916 --> 19:30.836
which means you get all of my expertise
and hard work for free.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.338
Or, if you want to,

19:33.422 --> 19:37.175
you could get the $40,000-a-year,
court-appointed public defender,

19:37.260 --> 19:39.469
who will almost certainly
escort you personally to death row.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.346
Your choice.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.598
No. No, sir. I...

19:44.934 --> 19:47.352
I'd surely be grateful
for anything you could do for me.

19:47.436 --> 19:52.315
You're welcome.
Now, your full name is?

19:53.192 --> 19:58.446
My... Aaron Luke Stampler.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.075
Stampler.

20:02.535 --> 20:06.663
- You from Kentucky, Aaron?
- Yes, sir. I'm from Creekside.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.791
Does it say that there?

20:12.670 --> 20:15.297
How long you been here in Chicago?

20:15.673 --> 20:19.968
Well, two years next month, I think.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.722
- Have you ever been arrested?
- No. No, sir.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.520
So how do you know the Archbishop?

20:33.816 --> 20:38.069
I was begging on the street
up on Wacker Drive,

20:40.489 --> 20:43.658
Bishop Rushman came by
in his Cadillac.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.829
He saw me, and he stopped.

20:49.165 --> 20:53.960
He took me into Savior House.
I work as an altar boy.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.671
I sing in his choir.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.674
How long were you there
at Savior House?

21:00.176 --> 21:01.760
Year, year and a half.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.846
You're supposed to leave
when you're 18,

21:04.931 --> 21:11.561
but Bishop Rushman let me stay on
way past my 19th birthday.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.023
That was nice of him.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.861
Yes. Yes, it was.

21:22.865 --> 21:26.326
Aaron, did you have any reason
to dislike the Archbishop?

21:26.410 --> 21:29.746
Dislike? No. No, sir.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.249
He was like a father to me.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.960
Yeah, but you...

21:36.879 --> 21:38.922
How do I say this? Were...

21:40.007 --> 21:42.842
Were you in the room
when he was murdered?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.722
How can you explain that?

21:49.016 --> 21:52.060
There was someone else
in that room, Mr. Vail.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.314
- There was a third person?
- Yes, sir.

21:56.399 --> 21:57.357
Did you tell the police this?

21:57.441 --> 22:00.986
Yes. Yes, I did,
but they didn't believe me.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.488
All right. Well, you tell me now.

22:04.907 --> 22:09.244
I was returning a book
to Bishop Rushman's library.

22:10.538 --> 22:14.749
I heard noise, so I went back into his...
In his bedroom.

22:18.254 --> 22:21.840
Bishop Rushman was laying
on the floor.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.926
There was blood all over everything.

22:25.594 --> 22:32.308
And then I seen a shadow. I seen
a person leaning over Bishop Rushman.

22:34.687 --> 22:39.315
He looked up and then he came at me,
and that's when I lost time.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.403
What does that mean, "lost time"?

22:44.113 --> 22:47.365
I blacked out.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.952
It just... It happens to me sometimes.

22:52.705 --> 22:56.875
I just... I have spells.

22:56.959 --> 23:00.086
I have spells. I lose time. I can't...

23:01.630 --> 23:03.673
I can't remember nothing.

23:08.888 --> 23:13.308
Why did you run from the police, Aaron,
if you didn't do anything wrong?

23:13.809 --> 23:15.101
Well, when...

23:15.186 --> 23:18.271
When I woke up, I was covered in blood.

23:19.815 --> 23:25.445
I didn't know what to do.
I got scared. I heard sirens, so I ran.

23:25.529 --> 23:29.074
Look, I know how it looks, Mr. Vail,
but I swear...

23:29.158 --> 23:31.076
Yeah, I don't need you
to try to convince me, Aaron.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.744
I just want you to answer my questions.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.371
But I didn't do this.
You've got to believe me.

23:35.456 --> 23:38.041
No, I don't have to believe you.
I don't care.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.167
I'm your attorney,

23:39.251 --> 23:44.798
which means I am your mother,
your father, best friend and your priest.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.010
In other words, I don't want you talking
to anyone but me from now on.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.971
Not the cops, not the press,
not the other guys in the cells here,

23:52.056 --> 23:55.809
nobody without my permission,
you understand? Yeah?

23:57.019 --> 23:59.479
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- All right.

24:00.356 --> 24:03.441
Now the important stuff.
What's your suit size?

24:05.027 --> 24:08.363
- My what?
- Suit size. What, you're about a 38?

24:13.244 --> 24:15.286
I don't know.

24:15.371 --> 24:18.748
- About a 38 long.
- Okay.

24:19.667 --> 24:20.959
Stampler was flushed by the police

24:21.043 --> 24:23.670
from his hiding place in the bushes
behind the cathedral.

24:23.754 --> 24:26.589
The police chased him through the train
yard, just north of McCormick Place,

24:26.674 --> 24:29.425
almost losing him
as he scrambled over tracks

24:29.510 --> 24:32.512
before an oncoming train,
separating him from the police.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.596
In a later development,

24:33.681 --> 24:36.099
prominent local
criminal defense attorney Martin Vail

24:36.183 --> 24:39.102
is believed to have visited Stampler
at the Maxwell Street Precinct...

24:39.186 --> 24:43.106
After a brief chase across the rail yard
behind Saint Michael's Cathedral,

24:43.190 --> 24:46.317
Stampler was apprehended in a hole
beneath train tracks.

24:46.402 --> 24:50.905
- Are you gonna defend this man?
- Andy, I'm sorry. I can't...

24:50.990 --> 24:52.490
Thank you very much. Thank you.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.744
We've taken the first step
in the process.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.038
I can now take your questions.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.624
Can you tell us anything
about the altar-boy group

25:01.709 --> 25:04.419
- that Aaron Stampler was part of?
- Not much at this time.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.505
Have you ruled out the involvement
of any of the other altar boys?

25:07.590 --> 25:10.258
We have no reason to suspect anyone
other than Stampler.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.385
He had access
to the Archbishop's quarters.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.554
He was caught fleeing the area
of Saint Michael's.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.639
The blood-soaked Aaron Stampler
was chased

25:16.724 --> 25:17.974
down under McCormick Place,

25:18.058 --> 25:20.351
but not before he was almost killed
by a passing train.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.520
Law office of Martin Vail.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.106
He's gonna call you
as soon as he gets in.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.358
I know. I promise you.
Okay, thank you very much.

25:27.443 --> 25:28.902
- Naomi!
- Yeah.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.069
- Talk to you later. Bye.
- Hey.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.946
Sorry I'm late. We have a new client.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.033
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.
- Who?

25:35.117 --> 25:37.368
You know what
they're calling him already?

25:37.453 --> 25:39.954
- The Butcher Boy of Saint Mike's.
- I like that.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.581
Well, that's good.
You're gonna be hearing it a lot.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.750
This kid who chopped up
the Archbishop, he's our new client?

25:43.834 --> 25:45.210
Tommy, you're gonna have to try harder

25:45.294 --> 25:47.462
to get the word "allegedly"
into your vocabulary,

25:47.546 --> 25:49.130
- especially if you want to be a lawyer.
- Here you go.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.965
- Tommy, you want coffee?
- No. No, thanks.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.219
All right. He admits he was in the room
when the killing occurred,

25:54.303 --> 25:56.137
but he didn't actually see it happen.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.513
- Can I stop you right there?
- No.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.891
He was returning a book
to the Archbishop.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.894
He heard loud noises in the bedroom.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.396
He went in. He sees a figure,

26:05.481 --> 26:09.484
someone in the shadows
kneeling over the body. He blacks out.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.777
Next thing he knows,

26:10.861 --> 26:12.946
sirens are screaming,
he's covered in blood.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.114
The cops find him in a train tunnel.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.492
He's got the Archbishop's ring
in his pocket.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.868
He stole the Archbishop's ring?

26:18.953 --> 26:22.080
I didn't say that.
I said it was in his pocket.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.001
Is that it?

26:29.838 --> 26:30.922
Yep.

26:32.967 --> 26:36.636
That's... That's bullshit, Marty.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.597
That's the worst bullshit story
I've ever heard in my entire life.

26:39.682 --> 26:43.643
Now it's our bullshit story.
Okay, let's get to work.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.938
Now, the name of the game here
is motive,

26:47.022 --> 26:48.940
as in, the prosecution doesn't have one.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.441
So what we have to do here

26:50.526 --> 26:53.569
is prove that someone else
could have committed the crime.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.571
Then we can establish
reasonable doubt.

26:55.656 --> 26:58.449
So I want to know everything I can
about this guy, everything he was into.

26:58.534 --> 27:02.745
We go to database,
go to Hall of Records, IRS files.

27:02.830 --> 27:05.123
- Even his so-called charities.
- So-called?

27:05.207 --> 27:07.875
The guy was a priest, for Christ's sake.

27:08.377 --> 27:13.423
Naomi, write this down. B-32.156.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.258
That was carved
into the Archbishop's chest.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.010
- Allegedly.
- No.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.804
That was a fact,
but I appreciate the effort, Tommy.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.306
Thanks.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.641
I also need case histories
on murder by stabbing,

27:23.726 --> 27:26.602
murder by mutilation,
murder by religion.

27:26.687 --> 27:29.480
- Also, I'm gonna need a psychiatrist.
- You're telling me.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.733
And not the kind
that lives in a witness box, either.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.318
I need a real one this time,

27:33.402 --> 27:34.861
and someone who knows
about amnesia.

27:34.945 --> 27:38.740
- What does he look like in person?
- The Butcher Boy?

27:41.535 --> 27:43.328
Like a Boy Scout.

27:43.412 --> 27:47.415
A Boy Scout
with a merit badge in carving.

27:48.709 --> 27:51.878
The Archbishop was a close
personal friend of Mr. Shaughnessy.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.630
He came to me earlier this morning
and asked me who was my best man,

27:54.715 --> 27:56.924
- I said you.
- Thank you.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.720
I trust, Mr. Shaughnessy,
if I am to prosecute this case,

28:00.804 --> 28:04.098
I'll be given the authority
which comes with the assignment.

28:04.183 --> 28:08.686
You're the one trying the case, but
let's establish one thing at the outset.

28:08.771 --> 28:10.772
I want the death penalty.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.775
I'd like an opportunity
to go over the case

28:13.859 --> 28:15.109
before we make a determination

28:15.194 --> 28:16.694
on whether or not
to seek the death penalty.

28:16.779 --> 28:18.529
I'm open to anything
you have to say, Janet,

28:18.614 --> 28:21.115
but in my mind there's no debate.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.703
Did he say anything,
the boy they picked up?

28:25.788 --> 28:27.663
Yeah. He didn't do it.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.541
It's a slam dunk, Janet.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.795
Excuse me.
I appreciate your faith in me,

28:33.879 --> 28:35.213
and I don't mean to be argumentative...

28:35.297 --> 28:36.839
Hey, that's what we pay you for.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.842
...but if it's as open and shut
as you say it is, then you don't need me.

28:39.927 --> 28:44.555
The P.D. will plead no contest,
throw the kid on the mercy of the court.

28:44.640 --> 28:51.062
- There's not a public defender.
- He's got a lawyer already? Who?

28:55.192 --> 28:59.028
Hey, I'm Martin Vail.
I'm defending Aaron Stampler.

29:00.155 --> 29:04.409
- I need to inspect the murder site.
- The Butcher Boy?

29:04.493 --> 29:07.245
Thank you. Yes. I forgot his real name.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.337
What's the matter, Marty,
lost your faith?

29:17.381 --> 29:18.881
Looking for a little religion?

29:18.966 --> 29:20.091
Now tell me, Counselor,

29:20.175 --> 29:23.261
which one of us
is the true headline-chaser here?

29:23.345 --> 29:27.181
- Unlike you, I was assigned to this case.
- Yeah? Think you're up to it?

29:27.266 --> 29:30.435
Sell the book rights yet,
or are you gonna wait a while?

29:30.519 --> 29:32.562
Want to see some pictures?

29:35.190 --> 29:37.483
Come on. They're kind of cute.

29:42.072 --> 29:46.451
I think you'll agree they clearly show
the heinous nature of the crime.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.081
A small piece of advice,

29:52.166 --> 29:54.584
don't use the word "heinous"
in a courtroom.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.752
Half the jury won't know
what you're talking about.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.337
One small piece of advice,

29:58.422 --> 30:00.798
I'm not sitting second chair
to you anymore.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.676
In case you hadn't noticed, I graduated.

30:07.598 --> 30:11.309
- I had no reason to leave.
- You had every reason to leave.

30:11.393 --> 30:12.477
How can you still work for them?

30:12.561 --> 30:16.105
What? You really expect me
to trot out after you, Marty?

30:16.190 --> 30:21.152
Quit, just because you did?
I don't need a Mercedes.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.405
I don't need to see my face
on the evening news.

30:29.620 --> 30:32.288
You knew I was coming here,
didn't you?

30:32.748 --> 30:35.291
You knew I would defend him.
That's why you took the case.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.584
You asked Shaughnessy for this,
didn't you?

30:36.668 --> 30:38.419
Oh, please.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.924
What's the matter, Marty, you nervous?

30:43.884 --> 30:47.762
Been a while since you rubbed up
against a woman with a brain?

30:50.265 --> 30:53.518
What is the matter? You tired?
You haven't been sleeping well?

30:53.602 --> 30:55.811
You're the one
with the score to settle, Marty.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.813
I sleep great at night.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.812
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:05.132 --> 32:06.340
Thanks.

32:08.051 --> 32:11.637
- Hey. Where is he?
- Over here.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.783
All right,
we'll be sitting at a table together,

32:32.868 --> 32:35.244
along with two of my associates.
Now, once the charges are read,

32:35.329 --> 32:37.955
the judge is gonna ask you
how you plead.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.333
- Not guilty.
- No.

32:40.417 --> 32:43.210
- But I'm not guilty, Mr. Vail.
- I don't care. It doesn't matter.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.171
You can keep your mouth shut.
You don't say anything.

32:45.255 --> 32:47.840
Well, you're going to say I'm not guilty.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.717
I'll say whatever I say.
You don't have to worry about it.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.761
- But, Mr. Vail...
- This is exactly what I'm talking about.

32:51.845 --> 32:54.805
This can't go on in the courtroom,
so you might as well get used to it now.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.642
I speak. You do not speak.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.602
Your job is just to sit there
and look innocent.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.479
Well, I am innocent.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.565
That's it!
That's exactly how I want you to look.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.651
That's exactly it.
Now, can you remember that?

33:06.735 --> 33:08.778
Look in the mirror if you have to.
That's the look.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.989
I don't have to.
This is how I always look.

33:12.074 --> 33:15.993
Well, then you're way ahead
of the game already, aren't you?

33:16.078 --> 33:17.495
Don't smile.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.290
Don't.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.592
Mr. Vail, can we have a statement?

33:31.677 --> 33:33.094
No. We're gonna find out
what happened here.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.888
How can you defend Aaron Stampler
in the face of all this public pressure?

33:35.972 --> 33:37.264
The only pressure is to find the truth.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.683
...with the Archbishop's blood on him.

33:38.767 --> 33:41.227
You've been talking to the police again,
haven't you? I told you not to.

33:41.311 --> 33:42.645
As usual, they get everything wrong.

33:42.729 --> 33:43.771
Come on. How're you gonna explain

33:43.855 --> 33:45.439
the fact that
he had blood-soaked clothing on him?

33:45.524 --> 33:46.691
- We all saw that.
- At this juncture,

33:46.775 --> 33:47.858
I'm not going to explain it at all.

33:47.943 --> 33:49.944
I've only recently been retained
in this case.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.614
Significant facts are in dispute here
and continue to be in dispute.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.409
Marty, you're a master at putting
the victim on trial

33:56.493 --> 33:57.785
to help your own client.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.995
That's going to be very difficult
in this case.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.665
A victim in this case is my client.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.876
We have two victims here, no suspects.
Thank you very much.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.044
Are you worried about his safety, Marty?

34:07.129 --> 34:08.545
No. Thank you.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.061
It's not a case.

34:24.146 --> 34:26.938
I don't think there'll be any question
about the verdict.

34:33.447 --> 34:34.739
All rise.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.701
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

34:39.661 --> 34:43.706
- Bailiff?
- State v. Aaron Stampler.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.041
Is everyone here? Sit down.
Is everyone here?

34:46.126 --> 34:48.085
Yes, Your Honor.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.754
Madam Prosecutor?

34:49.838 --> 34:52.214
The State charges the prisoner,
Aaron Stampler,

34:52.299 --> 34:54.759
with the crime
of murder in the first degree.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.552
How does your client plead, Counselor?

34:56.636 --> 34:57.762
Your Honor, if it pleases the court,

34:57.846 --> 35:01.098
I need time to make
a complete psychiatric evaluation

35:01.183 --> 35:02.266
before any charges
are brought against us.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.019
State has more than enough evidence
to warrant the allegations, Your Honor.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.896
I agree. Motion denied.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.774
Mr. Stampler,

35:09.858 --> 35:11.776
do you understand the charges
brought against you?

35:11.860 --> 35:14.111
- Yes. Yes, I...
- Your Honor, I direct my client

35:14.196 --> 35:15.321
not to answer that question

35:15.405 --> 35:18.616
on the grounds that his response
may tend to incriminate him.

35:18.700 --> 35:19.784
The defendant is taking the Fifth

35:19.868 --> 35:21.619
on whether or not
he understands the charges?

35:21.703 --> 35:25.247
Yes, Your Honor. Until we have
a complete psychological evaluation,

35:25.332 --> 35:28.959
he will be taking the Fifth
on any and all questions posed to him.

35:29.044 --> 35:33.756
State v. Appleby for your review
of precedent.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.216
Thank you.

35:51.566 --> 35:54.026
No, no, I can't do that. No.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.156
What do you want?

35:59.241 --> 36:03.077
I'm looking for the room
a kid named Aaron Stampler stayed in.

36:04.955 --> 36:08.082
- You the police?
- I'm his uncle.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.899
- Thanks.
- Well, hey.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.912
- This is Alex's.
- Who's Alex?

37:27.996 --> 37:32.249
- He's one of the other altar boys.
- An altar boy?

37:32.334 --> 37:35.085
An altar boy was wearing this?

37:35.170 --> 37:37.421
Well, not at the mass.

37:39.174 --> 37:41.425
Well, this altar boy attacked
a colleague of mine.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.427
He hurt him pretty bad.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.516
What do you think he was doing there
in your room?

37:49.601 --> 37:51.185
- My room?
- Yeah.

37:53.855 --> 37:57.483
I can't... I don't know.

37:57.567 --> 38:00.736
- I mean, I don't have nothing.
- You know where I could find him?

38:00.820 --> 38:02.780
Who? Alex?

38:04.491 --> 38:07.868
- No, I don't... I don't know where he is.
- You don't?

38:08.870 --> 38:11.538
- Who's Linda?
- Linda?

38:22.717 --> 38:24.468
She your girlfriend?

38:26.054 --> 38:30.599
- Where is she? I'd like to talk to her.
- I don't know where she is.

38:30.684 --> 38:33.477
Why is it that I get this feeling
you're not telling me something, Aaron?

38:33.561 --> 38:36.563
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I don't think so.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.733
Are you surprised that Alex
attacked my friend?

38:40.944 --> 38:45.531
- No. No, I mean, he has a temper.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so.

38:47.701 --> 38:50.869
Let me ask you this.
Do you think it could be Alex

38:50.954 --> 38:54.373
who was that figure you saw
at the Archbishop's room?

38:55.375 --> 38:59.753
- I... Alex? I couldn't be sure.
- But it could be him?

39:00.880 --> 39:01.964
I don't know.

39:02.048 --> 39:04.550
Aaron, you're not understanding this.
The State wants you dead.

39:04.634 --> 39:07.136
If you don't help me,
that's exactly what they're gonna get.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.303
I...

39:11.057 --> 39:13.934
I'm trying. I can't remember.

39:14.436 --> 39:17.688
I don't understand. Why would Alex
want to do such a thing?

39:17.772 --> 39:21.108
For his own reasons. He...
Maybe someone hired him.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.238
- Hired by who?
- I don't know. Forget it.

39:28.950 --> 39:32.161
What I need to know is,
do you think he's capable of doing it?

39:32.245 --> 39:34.246
I don't know. He...

39:35.999 --> 39:39.418
I don't know
who's capable of such a thing, Mr. Vail.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.134
- Thanks.
- Sure.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.554
So he claims there was someone else
in the room

39:50.638 --> 39:52.806
and that he can't remember.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.727
And you want me
to look into this amnesia question

39:56.811 --> 39:59.563
- and see what he actually knows.
- Yeah.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.982
What if he knows he did it?

40:02.067 --> 40:06.028
The major causes of amnesia
are substance abuse, seizures,

40:06.112 --> 40:08.447
head injuries and malingering.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.911
I think the kid's telling the truth.

40:15.705 --> 40:16.830
Okay.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.084
Then let's get something straight.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.586
I'm more than happy to go in
and analyze him.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.005
In fact, I'm looking forward to it.

40:25.090 --> 40:28.425
But I won't go in there
to validate his story, understood?

40:28.510 --> 40:32.179
- You do your job, I do mine.
- That's right.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.056
Listen, if I think it's necessary,

40:34.140 --> 40:37.810
I'd want to get an MRI, EEG,
and neuropsych testing, agreed?

40:37.894 --> 40:40.938
- Yes, Doctor. Good night, Doctor.
- Good night.

40:47.028 --> 40:49.363
I'll be recording our meetings
for Mr. Vail,

40:49.447 --> 40:52.616
so what we talk about
isn't as confidential the way it might be

40:52.700 --> 40:55.410
if you were to be consulting
with a doctor for help.

40:55.495 --> 40:56.870
He may even call me as a witness,

40:56.955 --> 40:59.123
so if you have any questions
about what I've just said,

40:59.207 --> 41:01.250
you should raise them now,
while he's still here.

41:01.376 --> 41:04.545
- No, ma'am. I understand.
- Good.

41:05.672 --> 41:09.049
- So, okay. I think we'll be fine.
- All right.

41:09.134 --> 41:12.052
- I'll see you later. All right.
- Okay.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.220
Bye.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.313
Mr. Vail told me
that there was a period of time

41:23.398 --> 41:26.441
surrounding the Archbishop's death
that you don't remember.

41:26.526 --> 41:30.821
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Yes. I lost the time.

41:32.282 --> 41:34.867
I mean, I blacked out.

41:36.077 --> 41:39.830
- Have you had these blackouts before?
- Yes. Yes, I have.

41:39.914 --> 41:43.167
When's the first time
you remember them happening?

41:45.920 --> 41:50.048
They started
when I was about 12, maybe.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.843
Were your parents aware
of what was happening to you?

41:52.927 --> 41:57.556
No. My mother was dead.

41:59.058 --> 42:00.684
And your father?

42:03.438 --> 42:08.358
No. No. No. He was not a nice man.

42:08.443 --> 42:12.196
- Did you seek treatment?
- Did I what?

42:12.280 --> 42:14.823
Did you see a doctor for them?

42:17.368 --> 42:19.328
No. No.

42:19.412 --> 42:23.332
You don't go see a doctor in Creekside
unless your leg's broke.

42:32.175 --> 42:36.011
- Hey. Can I talk to you?
- Talk.

42:36.095 --> 42:40.891
- Excuse us. I'll bring her right back.
- How dare you. What am I?

42:40.975 --> 42:43.018
I'm some kind of chess piece
you can just move around?

42:43.102 --> 42:47.648
- I was in the middle of my lunch.
- When are we getting all the discovery?

42:47.732 --> 42:48.774
What do you want, Marty?

42:48.858 --> 42:50.317
I want to know
when we're getting all the discovery.

42:50.443 --> 42:53.403
- I've got motions to file.
- No, you don't.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.781
You're looking to make a deal.

42:57.325 --> 42:58.784
I have no authority to deal.

42:58.868 --> 43:01.578
I haven't discussed this with my client.
What's your excuse?

43:01.663 --> 43:03.705
Well, if I thought we needed
to make a deal,

43:03.790 --> 43:05.207
I have all the authority I want.

43:05.291 --> 43:08.377
Bullshit! Shaughnessy wants
the whole shot on this,

43:08.461 --> 43:10.379
and he's using you to get it.

43:10.463 --> 43:12.130
Anybody in your position
would deal this down

43:12.215 --> 43:13.340
to murder with no death penalty.

43:13.424 --> 43:17.678
My position?
We have a fucking great case.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.554
Great case?

43:19.639 --> 43:23.433
Lack of prior record, no eyewitness,
no confession, no motive.

43:23.518 --> 43:25.060
Hard evidence.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.438
I assume this conversation means
you're not going with insanity,

43:28.523 --> 43:32.025
which is a shame.
My shrinks would have torn him apart.

43:33.778 --> 43:36.697
By the way, your pleading the Fifth
on the charges was brilliant.

43:36.781 --> 43:38.407
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

43:38.491 --> 43:39.866
I liked it.

43:41.202 --> 43:44.705
You lose this case, you take the fall,
not Shaughnessy.

43:46.833 --> 43:50.460
- Talk to me.
- We're going to trial, Marty.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.339
All right, all it takes is one,

43:54.424 --> 43:57.134
just one juror
that doesn't believe he did it.

43:57.218 --> 43:59.845
One juror, with a kid his age,
looks into that face...

43:59.929 --> 44:03.056
I've got to admit, that face is great.
Are you prepping him to take the stand?

44:03.141 --> 44:05.392
That stutter, it's priceless.

44:09.063 --> 44:12.774
Marty, don't tell me
you think he didn't do it.

44:14.193 --> 44:17.362
What, has little Aaron Stampler
gotten to you?

44:17.447 --> 44:21.992
We're not just talking about jail here.
It's about ending someone's life.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.994
If you're wrong
and Shaughnessy's made you do this,

44:24.078 --> 44:27.289
- you gonna be able to live with it?
- I'll live.

44:29.959 --> 44:31.626
See you in court.

44:34.589 --> 44:37.466
Your Honor, we stipulate
that murder was done here.

44:37.550 --> 44:39.843
Therefore, these photographs
have no remaining probative value.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.763
This is not just murder.
This is a case of mutilation and torture.

44:42.847 --> 44:46.016
The only reason the prosecution wants
to show these gory pictures to the jury

44:46.100 --> 44:47.309
- is shock appeal.
- That is not true, Your Honor.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.353
- They should be excluded, absolutely.
- They clearly identify

44:49.437 --> 44:50.812
the heinous nature of the crime,

44:50.897 --> 44:52.522
and they connect the defendant,

44:52.607 --> 44:54.733
who was found covered in blood,
to the crime scene.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.234
- Prejudicial.
- I beg to differ.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.528
- Beg all you want. I don't...
- Counsel, please.

44:58.613 --> 45:00.614
The photographs are in, Mr. Vail.

45:00.698 --> 45:01.740
Now, would you two like a recess

45:01.824 --> 45:03.784
so you can carry on this discussion
in private?

45:03.868 --> 45:05.744
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but this is too much.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.120
Next thing you know, he'll be objecting

45:07.205 --> 45:09.831
if we want to bring in
the murder weapon.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.669
Well, now that she brings it up...

45:19.467 --> 45:21.551
This is a public building.

45:27.850 --> 45:29.643
Excuse me, Mr. Vail.

45:31.521 --> 45:33.647
Would you sign this for me?

45:37.110 --> 45:40.821
Tell me about Linda.
Mr. Vail said she was your girlfriend.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.323
Yes. Yes, she was.

45:43.408 --> 45:45.826
How'd you meet?

45:45.910 --> 45:50.580
Well, we was both at the Savior House.
I was an altar boy,

45:50.665 --> 45:54.167
and she was doing work
for Bishop Rushman.

45:55.545 --> 45:58.672
- What was the relationship like?
- Me and Linda?

46:00.425 --> 46:04.261
She's real cultural.
Real cultural and very smart.

46:04.345 --> 46:07.097
We had a nice time together.

46:10.309 --> 46:12.436
We might get married.

46:14.397 --> 46:16.523
Were you sleeping together?

46:20.653 --> 46:24.823
- Well, that's private.
- I know. I have to ask the question.

46:24.907 --> 46:27.868
Were you having
a sexual relationship, Aaron?

46:30.455 --> 46:32.789
Yeah, yes, yes, we were.

46:32.874 --> 46:36.460
Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?

46:36.544 --> 46:39.379
- No.
- Was she?

46:48.973 --> 46:51.308
Has she been to see you, Aaron?

46:58.941 --> 47:01.902
- Well, well, no, but...
- And that upsets you.

47:05.907 --> 47:08.742
No. No. Thing is, she went away.

47:10.912 --> 47:12.996
She went away for a while.

47:13.623 --> 47:18.001
She left before this happened.
I don't even think...

47:18.085 --> 47:20.629
Don't even think she knows about it.

47:33.643 --> 47:35.018
- Yo, boss.
- Hey.

47:35.102 --> 47:37.896
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.856
There's nothing cataloged
at the downtown branch

47:39.941 --> 47:42.067
under the numbers B32156.

47:42.151 --> 47:44.861
But I don't think the "B" is a "B."
I think it's an eight.

47:44.946 --> 47:47.989
I think the knife slipped. 832156.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.535
"Thomas Jefferson"?
I don't think he did it.

47:51.619 --> 47:54.037
All right. Well, you're not gonna be
much happier with this.

47:54.121 --> 47:58.208
A list of the Archbishop's charities
and his foundation's investments.

47:58.292 --> 48:01.753
Nothing startling here,
except for how many there are.

48:03.965 --> 48:06.508
Wait a minute here. What's this?

48:06.592 --> 48:10.262
What was he doing
with the South River deal? Pull that up.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.058
Who are the investors?

48:17.645 --> 48:19.062
Shaughnessy?

48:20.189 --> 48:22.649
That's Joey Pinero's neighborhood.

48:23.109 --> 48:26.152
See this lot here?
This all used to be houses.

48:26.445 --> 48:29.739
In fact, there was a house
over there on the corner

48:30.324 --> 48:33.994
where I kissed my first girlfriend.
Got her pregnant, too.

48:34.996 --> 48:37.080
- Hell of a kiss, Joey.
- Oh, yeah.

48:37.164 --> 48:40.083
Anyway, this whole neighborhood's
gonna end up high-rent condos

48:40.167 --> 48:42.252
if those guys get their way.

48:42.336 --> 48:45.755
That's why I'm gonna buy back the lot
with the settlement you got me.

48:45.840 --> 48:46.840
- You heard about that, right?
- Yeah.

48:46.924 --> 48:49.092
- The money?
- Who hasn't?

48:49.176 --> 48:52.470
- Marty's the best, man.
- Just doing my job.

48:52.555 --> 48:54.889
Yeah. A million fucking five,
he's just doing his job.

48:54.974 --> 48:58.768
Alderman, Joey tells me
a cop came around,

48:58.853 --> 49:00.895
wanted him to set you up.

49:01.939 --> 49:03.440
It's typical.

49:04.317 --> 49:07.235
Can't buy me,
so they try and buy a brother.

49:07.820 --> 49:10.196
See, most people assume
that this land we're walking on

49:10.281 --> 49:14.659
belongs to the railroad, but it doesn't.
It belongs to the church.

49:15.745 --> 49:17.162
The church?

49:19.498 --> 49:22.042
- So that's the Rushman Foundation?
- That's right.

49:22.126 --> 49:24.919
Along with a bunch of rich developers.

49:25.004 --> 49:27.797
- Including John Shaughnessy?
- Yeah.

49:27.882 --> 49:30.550
Then they got greedy,
started buying up all the land

49:30.635 --> 49:33.970
and old buildings
around the church property,

49:34.055 --> 49:35.847
then tearing it down.

49:35.931 --> 49:38.141
Our old neighborhood
was gonna disappear.

49:38.225 --> 49:39.768
So I went to the Archbishop and I said,

49:39.852 --> 49:43.521
"What are you doing to these people?
They're poor.

49:44.106 --> 49:46.816
"They're getting kicked
out of their homes,

49:46.901 --> 49:48.234
"and they're Catholic."

49:48.319 --> 49:49.569
Fucking A.

49:49.654 --> 49:52.280
He listened. I couldn't believe it.

49:53.949 --> 49:56.326
He told them to stop developing
around the church property.

49:56.410 --> 49:57.410
So the partners are left

49:57.495 --> 50:00.163
holding these empty buildings
they can't knock down

50:00.247 --> 50:02.165
- and land they can't build on.
- That's right.

50:02.249 --> 50:05.001
Shaughnessy loses millions.

50:05.086 --> 50:07.212
Look, if I need you to, will you testify?

50:07.296 --> 50:10.674
Who, me? Yeah. Easy.

50:10.758 --> 50:13.259
Just change out of this suit,
put on a Brooks Brothers

50:13.344 --> 50:15.261
- with loafers and tassels, you bet.
- Joey, thank you.

50:15.346 --> 50:16.846
Thank you. Not you.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.016
Sure.

50:21.268 --> 50:22.894
I'll testify.

50:25.815 --> 50:27.691
Well, you know what people think.

50:27.775 --> 50:29.693
Think this great city runs itself.

50:29.777 --> 50:34.698
They think it gets up, goes to work and
climbs into bed at night just like we do.

50:34.782 --> 50:35.865
They're unaware of what it takes

50:35.950 --> 50:38.535
to make sure the whole damn thing
doesn't break down.

50:38.619 --> 50:41.705
Crime, fires, riots,

50:41.789 --> 50:44.332
the goddamn water pipes
bursting under the city.

50:44.417 --> 50:46.876
Christ, what a fucking mess that was.

50:46.961 --> 50:48.670
And who does
the water commissioner call?

50:48.754 --> 50:53.133
The contractor who built it? No.
He calls me. They all call me.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.680
God damn, this is terrific.

50:59.515 --> 51:03.435
They call me,
because I keep the peace.

51:03.519 --> 51:06.312
That's my job.

51:06.397 --> 51:09.441
This city doesn't burn
because I won't permit it.

51:09.525 --> 51:12.026
I'm the great negotiator.

51:12.111 --> 51:13.987
You think people get that?

51:14.071 --> 51:17.782
Truth is, they don't care.
Dumb bastards don't even vote.

51:17.867 --> 51:20.118
All they want to do is eat,
sleep, watch TV

51:20.202 --> 51:22.912
and occasionally fuck their wives.

51:22.997 --> 51:24.914
Guess we should all thank you.

51:25.875 --> 51:27.542
You're welcome.

51:28.836 --> 51:31.504
John, you need some new material.

51:31.589 --> 51:35.008
I've heard this "great city" speech
10 times already.

51:37.845 --> 51:41.598
Your boy Pinero's not honoring
his side of the deal.

51:41.682 --> 51:43.266
Is that what this dinner was about?
Pinero?

51:43.350 --> 51:44.851
In part.

51:45.853 --> 51:50.106
I told him what the deal is.
He's a grownup. What's the other part?

51:52.193 --> 51:53.735
I understand your assistant's
been digging around

51:53.819 --> 51:56.696
in the Archbishop's financial affairs.

51:57.323 --> 51:58.907
Yeah. Well...

52:06.123 --> 52:07.290
How much did you lose

52:07.374 --> 52:10.460
when he pulled the plug
from South River, John?

52:11.670 --> 52:14.130
Let me tell you something.

52:14.215 --> 52:15.590
It's a mistake to stick your thumb

52:15.674 --> 52:18.134
in the eyes of the most powerful people
in the city.

52:18.219 --> 52:20.804
It's not their eyes I'm aiming for.

52:24.517 --> 52:26.935
Do not fuck with me, Marty.

52:40.950 --> 52:43.368
Pipes are bursting again, John.

53:00.761 --> 53:04.097
In the most anticipated murder trial
in recent Chicago history,

53:04.181 --> 53:07.308
former State's Attorney prosecutor
Martin Vail will lead

53:07.393 --> 53:10.395
with his opening statement
on behalf of Aaron Stampler...

53:10.479 --> 53:12.146
The prosecution's case is headed

53:12.231 --> 53:14.732
by Assistant State's Attorney
Janet Venable. Venable was...

53:14.817 --> 53:17.652
Richard Rushman was a man of God.

53:17.736 --> 53:21.698
He spent his life giving
to the people of Chicago.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.116
He was a beacon of inspiration,

53:23.200 --> 53:26.202
not only as a spiritual leader,
but as a citizen.

53:26.287 --> 53:28.705
...will deliver his opening statement
tomorrow on behalf of defendant...

53:28.789 --> 53:30.582
My name is Martin Vail,

53:30.666 --> 53:33.793
and the reason I'm here,
and the reason you're here,

53:33.878 --> 53:36.629
is to make sure
that the whole truth is known.

53:36.714 --> 53:38.882
Now, we can begin to learn the truth

53:38.966 --> 53:42.051
by talking about what the prosecution
does not want you to hear.

53:42.136 --> 53:46.556
Do not be fooled by the defendant's
innocent appearance and demeanor.

53:46.640 --> 53:50.935
Aaron Stampler sat in judgment
of Archbishop Rushman

53:51.020 --> 53:53.813
and determined that
not only should he die,

53:53.898 --> 53:56.232
but he should die
the most brutal way possible.

53:56.317 --> 53:58.568
Aaron was arrested within minutes
of the Archbishop's death.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.737
We all know that.
We all saw it on television.

54:00.821 --> 54:04.407
But why? Because he was convenient.

54:04.491 --> 54:07.410
Because there was enormous pressure
on the police to solve this crime.

54:07.494 --> 54:11.915
The evidence will show
that Aaron Stampler stalked, ambushed

54:11.999 --> 54:14.250
and savagely murdered this great man.

54:14.335 --> 54:16.169
The prosecution does not want
you to hear

54:16.253 --> 54:18.129
about the other altar boys
in the church choir

54:18.213 --> 54:20.006
who have mysteriously disappeared.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.716
At the close of evidence,
ladies and gentlemen,

54:21.800 --> 54:24.928
you will learn that Aaron Stampler
had everything he needed

54:25.012 --> 54:26.679
for the perfect assassination.

54:26.764 --> 54:32.268
Using this knife,
Aaron Stampler repeatedly stabbed

54:32.353 --> 54:37.065
at the Archbishop's chest,
his genitals, his eyes.

54:37.149 --> 54:40.568
They don't want you to hear
that the Archbishop made investments

54:40.653 --> 54:42.654
on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church

54:42.738 --> 54:45.865
and that those investments
resulted in huge losses

54:45.950 --> 54:48.076
for some very, very powerful people.

54:48.160 --> 54:51.788
They don't want you to hear about
the 20 death threats this year alone

54:51.872 --> 54:54.123
that the Archbishop received
prior to his death.

54:54.208 --> 54:58.378
And they really don't want you to hear
about their theory of motive.

54:58.462 --> 55:00.713
And why is that? Very simple.

55:03.175 --> 55:05.009
They don't have one.

55:08.138 --> 55:10.890
Inspector Woodside,
can you explain to the court

55:10.975 --> 55:12.976
where these sneakers came from?

55:13.060 --> 55:16.479
They were taken off the defendant
when he was apprehended.

55:16.563 --> 55:19.649
And what was the result of
the bloodstain analysis done on them?

55:19.733 --> 55:22.360
The result of the analysis
proved to be human blood

55:22.444 --> 55:24.988
matching the blood type
and DNA characteristics

55:25.072 --> 55:26.531
of Archbishop Rushman.

55:26.615 --> 55:29.325
What do the bloody footprints
surrounding the body tell you?

55:29.410 --> 55:32.412
The killer left a pattern
of bloody footprints

55:32.496 --> 55:34.038
around the area of the struggle,

55:34.123 --> 55:37.000
as indicated by the spread of blood
through the room.

55:37.084 --> 55:38.710
All right, yes or no, Inspector?

55:38.794 --> 55:42.255
Could there have been a third person in
the Archbishop's quarters that morning?

55:42.339 --> 55:43.923
There is no evidence to suggest that.

55:44.008 --> 55:46.175
But there's no evidence
to prove there wasn't.

55:46.260 --> 55:47.343
No.

55:47.428 --> 55:49.512
And after the struggle,
what happened then?

55:49.596 --> 55:53.099
Well, analysis suggests that the killer
was startled during the mutilation

55:53.183 --> 55:55.643
and ran from the bedroom
down the stairs.

55:55.728 --> 56:01.441
Is it possible, Inspector,
that the real killer, a third person,

56:02.151 --> 56:03.609
who maybe was smart enough

56:03.694 --> 56:08.031
not to tramp a whole freeway of blood
through the whole place here,

56:08.115 --> 56:11.534
couldn't this third person have placed
the defendant's prints

56:11.618 --> 56:14.037
on the knife while he was passed out?

56:14.121 --> 56:16.039
Mr. Vail, anything is possible.

56:16.123 --> 56:19.500
So, clearly, the victim suffered
a great number of stab wounds?

56:19.585 --> 56:23.379
Yes, he did, 78.
He tried to defend himself.

56:23.464 --> 56:26.049
And that explains the cuts
on the hands and the forearms.

56:26.133 --> 56:29.135
Doctor, isn't it a fact
that you can't be sure

56:29.219 --> 56:35.058
whether more than one person inflicted
these 78 stab and incise wounds?

56:35.142 --> 56:37.977
That's true, Counselor. It could've been
more than one person, but I doubt it.

56:38.062 --> 56:40.772
From your analysis
of the knife wounds, Dr. Weil,

56:40.856 --> 56:44.233
do you have an opinion whether the
killer was left-handed or right-handed?

56:44.318 --> 56:47.070
Well, the incise wound to the throat
and most of the chest wounds

56:47.154 --> 56:50.364
were made from an angle that strongly
suggests that a left-handed person

56:50.449 --> 56:51.532
was using the knife.

56:51.617 --> 56:53.701
To your knowledge,
is the defendant left-handed?

56:53.786 --> 56:54.911
Yes, he is.

56:54.995 --> 56:57.246
Well, then it's possible
that a right-handed person

56:57.331 --> 57:01.209
could've deliberately used his left hand
to inflict some of these wounds.

57:01.293 --> 57:02.710
Yes, I suppose that is possible.

57:02.795 --> 57:05.088
Then it would be reasonable to assume

57:05.172 --> 57:08.633
that there was, in fact,
a third person there at the crime scene?

57:08.717 --> 57:11.636
Reasonable, no. But it is possible.

57:11.720 --> 57:13.471
Then following opening statements,

57:13.555 --> 57:15.473
it was a day of strong
and detailed testimony

57:15.557 --> 57:17.600
from the prosecution's first witnesses,

57:17.684 --> 57:20.019
Cook County Forensics Chief
Harvey Woodside

57:20.104 --> 57:22.522
and Cook County Medical Examiner
Emile Weil.

57:22.606 --> 57:24.690
It was also a day of
tough cross-examination

57:24.775 --> 57:25.942
of Woodside and Weil

57:26.026 --> 57:28.111
by Stampler defense attorney
Martin Vail.

57:28.195 --> 57:29.654
By most accounts, though,
the prosecution...

57:30.197 --> 57:31.906
Captain Stenner,
I would like to thank you

57:31.990 --> 57:33.950
for all the time you've given us today,

57:34.034 --> 57:36.327
but, finally,
I would like to turn your attention

57:36.411 --> 57:39.789
to the symbol carved
into the Archbishop's chest.

57:39.873 --> 57:43.292
Now would you please tell the jury
about that, Captain?

57:43.377 --> 57:49.048
Yes. The letter
and the numbers B32.156

57:49.133 --> 57:50.925
were carved into
the Archbishop's chest.

57:51.009 --> 57:52.552
What you just described,

57:52.636 --> 57:55.263
have you been able
to find an identical reference anywhere?

57:55.347 --> 57:56.973
I believe so, yes.

57:57.057 --> 58:02.812
The symbol B32.156
is actually catalog code for a book

58:02.896 --> 58:06.983
discovered in a private reading room
located in the church basement.

58:07.067 --> 58:11.946
That particular number, the B32 part,
refers to a book,

58:12.030 --> 58:14.991
The Scarlet Letter
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

58:15.075 --> 58:20.955
When we opened the book to Page 156,
we discovered an underlined passage.

58:22.749 --> 58:26.460
Would you please read
this underlined passage to the court?

58:29.381 --> 58:32.341
"No man, for any considerable period,

58:32.426 --> 58:36.429
"can wear one face to himself
and another to the multitude

58:36.513 --> 58:40.600
"without finally getting bewildered
as to which may be the true."

58:41.560 --> 58:43.060
Thank you.

58:46.982 --> 58:48.941
What does that passage
mean to you, Captain?

58:49.026 --> 58:51.903
Objection. He's a policeman,
not an English professor.

58:51.987 --> 58:54.739
His interpretation would be speculative
and irrelevant.

58:54.823 --> 58:56.616
I didn't hear her ask
for an expert opinion.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.784
The witness can answer.

58:59.912 --> 59:02.038
Well, to me, it's simple.

59:02.122 --> 59:05.041
The killer thought
that his victim was two-faced,

59:05.125 --> 59:06.584
dishonest in some way.

59:06.668 --> 59:08.502
In your experience, Captain,

59:08.587 --> 59:12.381
do killers ever intentionally
leave clues to their motive?

59:12.466 --> 59:14.884
Not often, but it happens.

59:20.891 --> 59:22.141
Thanks.

59:22.935 --> 59:24.977
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, sure.

59:25.437 --> 59:28.022
Did you underline that book?

59:28.106 --> 59:30.691
- Did I what?
- Did you underline that book?

59:30.776 --> 59:33.861
- No. No, Mr. Vail.
- No?

59:33.946 --> 59:37.615
No. Mr. Vail.
I never even opened The Scarlet Letter.

59:37.699 --> 59:40.701
I don't like Hawthorne.

59:40.786 --> 59:43.246
I tried to read that one about the house
with the seven somethings

59:43.330 --> 59:46.415
in high school.
I couldn't even get past Page 10.

59:48.168 --> 59:52.255
I mean, I weren't the only one using
Bishop Rushman's library.

59:52.631 --> 59:55.007
You know what? Everybody borrowed
books from Bishop Rushman.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.342
He encouraged it.

59:56.426 --> 59:58.511
His altar boys and staff,
everyone was in there.

59:58.595 --> 59:59.887
Guard?

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.266
Thanks.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.650
You don't give up, do you?

01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:19.991
So you didn't know anything about that?

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:22.326
- No.
- What about the impact of...

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:25.121
Look, I can't talk to you right now.
My office will call you, all right?

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.498
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay, bye. Yeah, I'll see you.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:31.252
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.052
What the fuck happened in there?

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:44.348
I guess that eight was a "B" after all.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:48.519
You think this is funny?
We're losing this case.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:51.981
What the hell happened, Tommy?
How could you have missed that?

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.149
Marty, there are 50 of them,

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.984
plus the entire
Chicago Police Department.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:57.528
How was I to know he had a private
reading room in the church basement?

01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:59.363
- It's your job to know.
- Fuck, Marty, you want my job?

01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:00.948
No. I want you to do your fucking job!

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:02.658
Marty, come on.

01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:05.369
I'm working
on a third-man defense here.

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:06.996
Do you know that?
Have you figured that out yet?

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.582
I don't have a third man.
You know why I don't have a third man?

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.126
'Cause you can't fucking find him!
That's why.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.086
Is it that hard to find one indigent kid?

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:17.256
Look, maybe we already got
the kid who did this.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:21.010
We have to at least consider
the possibility that he did it.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.553
All the hard evidence
is pointing towards him,

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.055
and you keep refusing to even look at it.

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:27.975
I'm not refusing to look at anything!
I don't think he did it!

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:29.852
Look, you two,

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:31.979
we're up there in a couple of days,
and we got dick!

01:01:32.064 --> 01:01:34.607
So I wish the two of you'd do
your fucking goddamn jobs, all right?

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.025
Fuck!

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:52.541
It must have been hard for you
to come here to Chicago.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.668
You didn't know anybody.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:56.962
No. Nobody.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.632
Didn't have any money?

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:02.635
No, nothing.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:08.641
I want to talk more about your girlfriend,
Linda, now. Can we, Aaron?

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:12.520
- No.
- Why not?

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:18.275
Aaron.

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:26.534
I'm sorry.

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:31.831
Do you think we can do this later?

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:37.753
- No, I want to stay with this for a minute.
- I'm just feeling a little tired.

01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:41.340
I know. Why does talking
about Linda Forbes upset you?

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.219
It doesn't.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:49.557
I just don't want to talk
about it right now.

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:54.728
- Why not? Are you all right?
- No, my head hurts.

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:58.983
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Let me just fix this.

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:06.282
Hey, you know what I can do
with this thing?

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.742
No, how the fuck should I know?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.539
Jesus Christ.

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:23.883
Aaron?

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.685
What?

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:38.230
What were you saying?

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.792
Come on.

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:27.900
Stop him!

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:32.446
Who the fuck are you?
What do you want?

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:33.906
What do you want, God damn it?
I'll kill you!

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.325
I don't think so, Alex. Drop it.

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:38.327
Drop it.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:46.251
- Remember me?
- My name is Martin Vail.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.670
I don't give a fuck what your name is.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.381
- You got no right doing this to me.
- I have every fucking right!

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:53.175
I'm Aaron Stampler's attorney,
you little shit!

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:56.929
Now, what do you know
about the Archbishop's murder?

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:00.766
Nothing.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.351
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.645
Bullshit! Don't fuck with us.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:07.815
I swear I know nothing.

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:10.150
Well, then,
what were you doing over there?

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:13.696
What were you doing at Aaron's house?
What were you looking for?

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.824
- A tape.
- A tape? Videotape?

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:18.450
- Yeah.
- Of what?

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.540
Sex stuff.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.042
Sex stuff?

01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:30.003
What, I have to draw a picture for you?

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:31.130
Who?

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:33.048
Who?

01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:35.342
Me, Linda.

01:07:39.139 --> 01:07:40.222
And Aaron?

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:43.142
Yeah. He shot it, too,
for the Archbishop.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:45.728
Are you telling...

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:50.899
Are you telling me that Archbishop
Rushman is involved with sex stuff?

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:53.902
Yeah, he called it "purging the devil."

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:56.155
He'd say a sermon for 10 minutes,
and then he'd tell us what to do.

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:59.908
- You're full of shit.
- I don't give a fuck what you believe!

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:02.244
Hey, hey, hey. What? What?

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:04.204
What were you going to do
with the tape?

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:05.914
- What were you going to do?
- Trash it.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:08.000
I was gonna throw it away.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:09.918
Just one. One tape. Just one tape.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:12.838
Yeah. Yeah. One. He'd use the same
one. He'd keep recording over and over.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.673
So what made you think Aaron had this?

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:18.260
I don't know. I thought maybe he got it,
and he went back and killed him.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:22.139
- I mean, he did kill him, right?
- No, he didn't.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.810
So where's this girl? Where's Linda?

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.895
I don't know.

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.902
She freaked out!
She panicked. She split.

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:37.529
I don't know.
I'm not expecting any postcards.

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:46.287
Look at me. Look at me.

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:58.425
Get him the fuck out of here, Tommy.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.805
- Where to?
- A warm bunk and three meals a day.

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:07.434
- You can't arrest me! You're not a cop!
- I used to be. Does that work for you?

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.256
- Look who's here.
- Don't get up. Finish it.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.341
- It's a good article.
- You know the rules.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:41.676
Don't disturb anything.
Don't remove anything.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.386
If you do, it's my ass.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.180
Yeah, mine, too. I won't touch anything.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.534
Excuse me.

01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:59.880
...preach the gospel to every...

01:11:05.345 --> 01:11:06.511
Hello.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.432
- What are you guys watching?
- Wait a minute.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:13.810
Go to her. Good.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:20.525
Now help her. That's it, Aaron. Good.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:23.779
Linda, help out.

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:27.866
Good. Take off her blouse, Aaron.

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:33.538
That's it. Now help him, Linda.

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:38.710
Isn't that sweet, Linda? Good. That's it.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.713
Now, take him in your mouth.

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.257
- Here's motive.
- Aaron,

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.510
take her from behind.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.722
- Aaron, take her from behind.
- Jesus Christ.

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:55.811
Thanks.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.361
487113 report to...

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:08.073
- I need to talk to him alone.
- I think there's something

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:11.660
- we should discuss.
- I need to be alone with my client.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:24.589
Do you trust me?

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.050
Do...

01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:29.428
Yes, yes, of course I do.

01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:32.264
Good. Because I don't trust you.

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:40.105
I'll lay it all out for you.

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:45.902
I'm losing this case.
You know why I'm losing this case?

01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:48.947
'Cause my fucking client
is fucking lying to me.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.700
- I never lied to you.
- Bullshit!

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:55.704
That's it. No more bullshit.
No more games.

01:12:57.457 --> 01:12:59.541
Everybody thinks
you did this, everybody.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.044
I'm the only one who believes you,
and I am that close.

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:05.589
So I want it all out. All of it.
Right now, right here.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:09.801
Did you underline that book?

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:13.805
Hey, hey. Hey, look at me.
Did you underline that book?

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:17.476
- No, I didn't.
- I don't believe you.

01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:19.644
- That is bullshit.
- I told...

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:23.273
I don't fucking believe you!
I saw the tape!

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:28.278
I saw the tape. I know what he did
to you. I want to hear it from you.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:29.571
No! No! No!

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.573
Tell me the whole thing.
Don't fucking do this.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:33.784
I want you to tell me the truth,
and do not even think of lying.

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:35.452
You fucking killed him, didn't you?
You did it!

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:36.912
- You killed him. You're so full of shit!
- No!

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:39.372
You did it, didn't you?
Tell me the truth. Don't lie to me.

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:42.084
You little fuck! You did it.
You killed him! You son of a bitch!

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:44.336
- You fucking killed him!
- No!

01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:46.505
What the hell do you want
from me now?

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:49.758
Quit your crying! I can't understand
a goddamn word you're saying.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:52.344
You little sissy! You make me sick!

01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:58.975
- Looky here. Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck are you?

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.020
This is my cell, Jack!
Who the fuck are you?

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:09.361
I got you now. You're the lawyer.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:12.697
- You his lawyer, ain't you?
- Yeah.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:15.242
Yeah, with your fancy suit.
I heard about you.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:19.371
Well, my, my, you sure
fucked this one up, Counselor.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:22.124
It sounds to me like they're gonna
shoot old Aaron so full of poison

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:24.417
it's gonna come out his eyes!

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:27.129
- Where is Aaron?
- Aaron's crying off

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:29.339
in some corner somewhere.
You scared him off!

01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:31.800
You've got to deal with me now, boy.

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:34.886
I ought to give you a beating
on principle. Look at me.

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:38.223
You ever come in here and pull any
of that tough-guy shit on Aaron again,

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.225
I will kick your fucking ass to Sunday!

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:43.687
- Do you understand me?
- I understand you. I understand.

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:47.107
Aaron gets in trouble, he calls you.
You're the man.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.609
Well, Aaron couldn't kick his own ass.

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:52.404
I mean, you seen him, with the...

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:54.156
Yeah.

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:57.159
Jesus Christ, he can't handle anything.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:15:00.829
He sure as shit couldn't handle
all that preacher's blood, could he?

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:03.582
If he'd done like I told him,
we wouldn't be in this mess,

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:05.750
but he got scared, and...

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:10.005
Ran off, got hisself caught,
the stupid little shit.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:13.091
So Aaron did kill Rushman.

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:16.136
Hell, no!
Jesus Christ, where did they find you?

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:20.265
Ain't you been listening to me?
Aaron don't have the guts to do nothing.

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:23.268
It was me, boy.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.562
- It was me.
- It was you.

01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:28.732
- It was you. It was you.
- Yes, it was.

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:32.861
He come crying to me like always,
stuttering and whining.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:37.324
"I can't take it no more, Roy.
You got to help me.

01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:39.284
"Please, please, Roy."

01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:41.828
I said, "Shut your mouth, you little girl!

01:15:41.913 --> 01:15:43.413
"Grow up. Be a man.
Take care of yourself."

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:45.081
- Be a man, yeah.
- Know what I'm saying?

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.670
So your name is Roy?

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:54.674
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. Yeah.
What is it? Marty?

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:56.051
- Yeah.
- Hey, listen, Marty.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:58.303
I'm dying for a smoke.
Do you have a cigarette on you?

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:01.389
- No, I quit.
- Fuck that.

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:05.060
I can't live without them. There's got
to be a butt around here somewhere.

01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:06.228
Roy.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.565
Roy, tell me about Linda.

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.402
- Linda?
- Linda, yeah.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:15.820
Well, who the fuck cares about Linda?

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.573
Well, I care about Linda.
I'd like to know about Linda.

01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:20.033
That little tramp.
Let me tell you something.

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:22.577
Everybody had a piece of her,
you know what I'm saying?

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.371
I mean, she had Aaron
wrapped up so tight,

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:25.914
he actually thought
she was his girlfriend.

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:28.667
It was pathetic. She broke his heart.

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:34.047
So that's why you had to kill Rushman,
because of the sex stuff.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.677
You've seen the tape.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:43.098
Answer me, you son of a bitch!

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:48.353
Do you think I'm playing with you?
I will break your fucking neck!

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:51.231
I'm going to ask you again.
Have you seen that tape?

01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:52.774
I saw the tape.
Yeah, of course I saw the tape.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:55.694
God damn it, God damn it.
I told him to get that tape.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.154
I said, "Get the fucking tape.
It's motive, you asshole!"

01:16:58.239 --> 01:16:59.864
This is going
to fuck everything up, Marty.

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.783
Don't you show that
to a goddamn person!

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:02.993
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. Yes.

01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:04.411
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. Shit.

01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:06.162
- Aaron.
- Damn!

01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:53.168
Mr. Vail?

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:01.968
Yeah, I'm right here, Aaron.

01:18:26.786 --> 01:18:29.454
He did it. The little fuck did it.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.626
How could I have missed that?

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.961
- Do I need stitches?
- No.

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:44.260
He didn't do it. Aaron has no idea
what just happened in there.

01:18:44.929 --> 01:18:47.389
I kept seeing all the signs, the big ones.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:50.141
The abusive background,
these repeated blackouts,

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:51.476
the ellipses in thought.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.144
He's ambidextrous.
That's what I was trying to tell you

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.396
when you came in tonight.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.818
Look, you may be thrilled by all this,
but I'm fucked. I don't have a case.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:03.446
It's textbook
multiple personality disorder.

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:05.407
Put me on the stand. I'll testify.

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:07.492
He's insane.

01:19:08.536 --> 01:19:13.415
I can't. I can't change plea
in the middle of a trial.

01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:16.251
The judge would never allow it.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:19.504
Besides, insanity is
the hardest thing to prove.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:21.548
Okay.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.260
My professional opinion?

01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:29.514
This is not a criminal
we're dealing with. It's a sick kid.

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:33.143
He's sitting in a cell,
and it's not where he belongs.

01:19:39.859 --> 01:19:41.568
You got an aspirin?

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:42.420
Come on, Connerman, ask it.

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:44.756
Ask what?

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:49.844
The question
you wanted to ask me before.

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:53.097
I don't understand, Mr. Vail.

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:56.518
"How can you defend someone
if you know they did it?

01:20:56.602 --> 01:20:57.685
"How can you do that?

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.854
"How can you fucking defend
these fucking scumbags?"

01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:02.482
Isn鈥檛 that what you wanted to ask me?
It is, isn't it?

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:04.901
All those fucking coy questions,
all that bullshit.

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:07.946
Bottom line is,
"How can you do what you do?"

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.412
You think it's the money, don't you?

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:22.877
The money's nice.
The money's very, very nice, Jack.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:26.589
You know,
the first thing I ask a new client is,

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:30.051
"You been saving up for a rainy day?

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:33.805
"Guess what? It's raining."

01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:39.978
You think it's because I want to see
my face on the cover of magazines?

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:45.775
My 15 seconds on TV? I love it.
I fucking love that shit. I really do,

01:21:47.278 --> 01:21:48.820
but guess what.

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.072
It's not it.

01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:57.161
- You go to Las Vegas?
- Yeah.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:01.416
I don't go to Vegas.
Why do you think I don't go to Vegas?

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.127
Marty, it's late. I think that
we should both just get up and go...

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:08.047
Why gamble with money when you can
gamble with people's lives?

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:12.969
That was a joke.

01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:18.016
All right, I'll tell you.

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:27.775
I believe in the notion that people
are innocent until proven guilty.

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:31.988
I believe in that notion
because I choose to believe

01:22:32.406 --> 01:22:34.741
in the basic goodness of people.

01:22:36.035 --> 01:22:40.204
I choose to believe that not all crimes
are committed by bad people,

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:43.041
and I try to understand

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:47.712
that some very, very good people
do some very bad things.

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:07.065
You know,
when I was working for Shaughnessy,

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.109
I did something very, very bad. Maybe

01:23:11.362 --> 01:23:15.198
illegal. I was a prosecutor then.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:20.828
This thing that I did, I was very upset
by it, and I decided to leave.

01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:24.916
So I left. I became a defending attorney.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:28.795
The irony being that everyone
assumes I'm fucking lying anyhow.

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.173
So I made myself this little promise that

01:23:35.386 --> 01:23:38.930
I would reserve my lies
for other than my public life.

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.779
You print any of this,
I'll sue your fucking ass.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.224
All right, all right,
so I made a little mistake.

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:24.809
No shit.

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:29.063
What do you want? Want a new suit?
I'll buy you a new suit.

01:24:29.148 --> 01:24:32.817
You made a mistake?
You told us the third man did it.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:36.070
So now you got your third man
and a fourth man and a fifth man...

01:24:36.155 --> 01:24:38.489
What are you going to do, Marty?

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:41.451
I don't know. I really fucked up here.

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.120
You were right.

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:47.081
So how are you gonna get him off?

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.251
I don't know.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:54.338
What I know is, Aaron did not commit
first-degree murder.

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:57.425
- Marty, he stabbed him a billion times...
- No, not Aaron.

01:24:58.302 --> 01:25:02.346
To convict someone of a capital crime,
the State must prove intent.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:04.766
Roy had intent, Aaron didn't.

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:07.226
Yeah, but the only way to prove that
is to change the plea to insanity,

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:10.605
which we can't do mid-trial, unless
you're planning on a career change.

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:13.441
I could've been mistaken,
but I wasn't wrong.

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:16.986
Aaron is innocent. It's Roy who is guilty.

01:25:17.154 --> 01:25:19.113
This kid doesn't need a lawyer.
He needs an exorcist.

01:25:19.198 --> 01:25:22.450
Tom, you are so full of shit. You were
not there, and you didn't see it.

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:26.078
He's one sick motherfucking boy, man,
who's been fucked around his whole life

01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:28.998
by his father, by his priest.
This kid does not deserve to die,

01:25:29.082 --> 01:25:32.835
and it's our job to make sure that a jury
believes he doesn't deserve to die.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.213
- Okay.
- Okay. How do we do it?

01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:40.218
By somehow introducing
this whole abuse thing.

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:48.851
- The tape.
- What about the tape?

01:25:48.936 --> 01:25:51.479
That's crazy. That gives him motive.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:54.065
No, it looks like that, but it's...

01:25:54.608 --> 01:25:58.653
No, actually, what it does is,
it turns this whole thing around.

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:03.074
It gives concrete documentation
of what Rushman did to this kid.

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:05.743
But we can't put it in. You know that.

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:09.121
But we're not going to.

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:17.922
Oh, fuck!

01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:28.766
- Okay. Okay.
- Good.

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:05.553
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:07.889
- Who is this?
- You know damn well who it is.

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:10.308
- Barleycorn's, Marty. Now.
- Janet?

01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:13.686
Cute porno. Part of your collection?

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:28.492
Hey.

01:27:30.621 --> 01:27:33.080
Where did you get it? You steal it

01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:35.291
- from the crime scene?
- I don't know anything about this tape.

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:37.251
- You are such a liar.
- Think about it.

01:27:37.336 --> 01:27:39.086
- I have.
- Look, if this tape really has on it

01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:40.171
what you say it does,

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:41.923
last thing I'd do is give it to you.
It gives you motive.

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:43.841
- You had to give it to me.
- Why?

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:46.344
You couldn't introduce it in court.
The jury would despise you for it,

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:48.137
for dishonoring the Bishop's memory.

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:52.642
But if you get me to show it, motive or
no motive, I'm the one who looks bad,

01:27:52.726 --> 01:27:56.270
and you gain sympathy
for your poor little abused boy.

01:27:57.856 --> 01:28:00.191
- You think so?
- I hate you.

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:04.278
Don't use it.

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:08.532
I have no intention of using it.

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:12.870
- The usual, Stu.
- You got it.

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:20.962
You're up to even more than that,
aren't you?

01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:22.338
I'm not up to anything.

01:28:22.422 --> 01:28:24.632
You're opening a door, you think
I'm going to walk through it?

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:26.676
There's going to be a tiger
on the other end, and I don't...

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.302
You know who'd be really upset
if you used it?

01:28:28.387 --> 01:28:29.804
- I just told you...
- Shaughnessy.

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:31.722
- Fuck him.
- Fuck him?

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:33.057
Fuck you.

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:38.688
Thanks a lot.

01:28:41.692 --> 01:28:44.235
All right, if this is not your motive,
what is?

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:45.903
I have motive.

01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:47.989
Yeah, what is it?

01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:51.575
I'm really gonna tell you.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:55.037
Well, you better tell the jury pretty soon.
Time's running out.

01:28:55.122 --> 01:28:56.539
Here you go.

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:01.293
You think you've got me.

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:08.801
You think because you know me as
well as you do, you know how I think.

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:12.263
Well, I know how you think.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.271
You know what I'm thinking?

01:29:26.153 --> 01:29:28.279
What happened to your face?

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:33.117
I bumped it into a medicine cabinet.

01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:40.916
No, Marty,
that was a girl on her way out.

01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:49.050
Maybe we should come back here later.

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:50.760
Later? Well, they close in 10 minutes.

01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:52.178
No, after.

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:54.764
After the trial.

01:29:56.475 --> 01:29:58.601
When we've got nothing to lose.

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:05.775
How can your timing
be so good in a courtroom

01:30:05.859 --> 01:30:08.360
and so bad in real life?

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:14.992
I'll think about it later.
I hate you too much right now.

01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:28.464
You got a visitor.

01:30:30.217 --> 01:30:31.634
Here she comes.

01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:35.846
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:37.932
Janet.

01:30:39.017 --> 01:30:40.184
Morning.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:46.190
So where's the tape?

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:49.360
There's some pretty ugly stuff
on that tape.

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:53.197
- Yes, there is.
- Who would've thought?

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:59.161
- Where did it come from?
- Landed on my front door last night.

01:30:59.246 --> 01:31:00.663
- No note.
- Vail?

01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:03.374
- Who else?
- Clever prick.

01:31:04.668 --> 01:31:06.502
What do you think he's up to?

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.171
- I honestly don't know.
- Cut the crap, Janet.

01:31:09.256 --> 01:31:12.424
You know him pretty goddamn well.
You were balling him, for Christ's sake.

01:31:14.553 --> 01:31:16.679
- Where is it?
- At home.

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:22.143
I have some advice for you.

01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:26.522
My advice for you, if you really have
aspirations beyond this particular office,

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:30.401
is to pick up that little handbag of yours,
go home right now and destroy this tape

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:33.320
you should've destroyed, like I did,
the minute you received it.

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:36.740
You don't think Vail has a copy?

01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:39.493
You don't think there's an original?

01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:46.375
It's Stampler that's on trial,
not the Catholic Church,

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:49.920
and if you haven't found another motive
to hang him on, then God help you.

01:32:01.308 --> 01:32:02.641
All rise.

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:06.520
Please, sit down.

01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:12.902
Madam Prosecutor.

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:20.993
Miss Venable.

01:32:22.954 --> 01:32:24.622
The State calls Thomas Goodman.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:27.791
Objection, Your Honor.

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:29.043
Prosecution knows full well

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:31.754
that Mr. Goodman is my investigator
in this case,

01:32:31.838 --> 01:32:35.007
and under the Work Product Rule,
he can't be compelled to testify.

01:32:35.091 --> 01:32:36.550
Permission to approach the bench,
Your Honor?

01:32:36.635 --> 01:32:37.885
Granted.

01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:46.644
Important evidence has just
come into my possession

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:48.646
which I believe
this witness can authenticate.

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:52.149
That's Mr. Vail's privilege. If Mr. Vail
doesn't want Mr. Goodman to testify,

01:32:52.234 --> 01:32:54.068
Mr. Goodman doesn't testify.

01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:55.819
Make a decision, Mr. Vail.

01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:02.159
Mr. Goodman, have you ever been
to my apartment?

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.954
- No.
- By that I mean my apartment building.

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:06.914
Allegedly.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:09.583
I'm sorry, you're confused.
Either you have or you haven't.

01:33:09.668 --> 01:33:11.669
"Allegedly" doesn't figure into it.

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:15.589
I have been there, yes.

01:33:15.674 --> 01:33:19.343
- Why did you go there?
- I was delivering something.

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.636
For whom?

01:33:23.181 --> 01:33:24.348
Martin Vail.

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:28.894
Mr. Vail sent you
to deliver something to me.

01:33:28.979 --> 01:33:30.688
- Yes.
- What was it?

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:34.275
A videotape.

01:33:34.359 --> 01:33:37.486
Could this have been the tape
you delivered for Mr. Vail?

01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:39.655
I have a feeling it is, yes.

01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:41.949
The People place
this half-inch videocassette tape

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:44.785
- in evidence, Your Honor.
- So ordered. Bailiff, please index.

01:33:44.869 --> 01:33:49.039
Now, where did Mr. Vail get this tape,
if it is indeed the same one?

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:53.335
He took it from the closet
of Archbishop Rushman.

01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.170
- He stole it.
- No, no, he borrowed it.

01:33:55.255 --> 01:33:58.132
Once I made the transfer for him,
I returned it, so...

01:33:59.009 --> 01:34:01.760
Can you describe for me
what's on this tape?

01:34:01.845 --> 01:34:04.847
There was a sermon
by Archbishop Rushman on it,

01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:08.350
a rehearsal of a sermon, I should say,
followed by

01:34:11.521 --> 01:34:15.149
- a kind of home movie.
- A home movie? Of what?

01:34:15.525 --> 01:34:17.401
- Some altar boys.
- And?

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:20.571
- A girl.
- Doing what?

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:25.534
An altar-boy lesson of some kind?

01:34:27.871 --> 01:34:29.538
Having sex.

01:34:31.416 --> 01:34:32.499
Quiet.

01:34:33.043 --> 01:34:34.501
A porno movie.

01:34:35.128 --> 01:34:38.005
- Yes.
- Yes. Now.

01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:43.010
How is it, do you think,
that this tape, this porno tape,

01:34:43.094 --> 01:34:47.222
was in the Archbishop's closet
in order for Mr. Vail to find it there?

01:34:47.307 --> 01:34:51.352
- He was the... The director.
- Who was?

01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:54.438
- Archbishop Rushman.
- Quiet in the court!

01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:59.902
And was the defendant
one of the altar boys

01:34:59.986 --> 01:35:02.780
performing in the Archbishop's
home movie?

01:35:03.782 --> 01:35:06.241
- Yes, he was.
- Was his girlfriend?

01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:08.577
I believe her name is Linda Forbes.

01:35:09.287 --> 01:35:10.788
Yes, she was.

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:14.750
And did it appear to you
that the defendant was enjoying

01:35:14.834 --> 01:35:17.669
performing in this film
with his girlfriend?

01:35:17.754 --> 01:35:19.880
No, he does not.

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:22.257
I will not ask you, Mr. Goodman,

01:35:22.342 --> 01:35:25.219
if you think we have just
uncovered motive here.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:28.806
We will decide that for ourselves
once we've all seen the videotape.

01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:31.600
No further questions.

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:36.271
Does Defense wish to cross?

01:35:39.859 --> 01:35:42.861
- No, Your Honor.
- Court's in recess.

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:46.407
Bailiff, please set up for the tape.
Mr. Goodman, you're excused.

01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:52.830
Thanks for the advice.

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:02.548
- Mr. Vail said she was your girlfriend.
- Yes. Yes, she was.

01:36:02.632 --> 01:36:06.009
- How'd you meet?
- We was both at the Savior House.

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:10.180
I was an altar boy,

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:15.686
and she was working
for Bishop Rushman.

01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:16.937
Doing what?

01:36:23.403 --> 01:36:25.863
Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?

01:36:26.865 --> 01:36:29.575
- No.
- Was she?

01:36:31.369 --> 01:36:33.370
No.

01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:37.541
Has she been to see you, Aaron?

01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:42.254
- Yeah? No, I'm still here.
- No.

01:36:44.382 --> 01:36:46.717
- What?
- Does that upset you?

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:10.407
Okay.

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:33.138
Mr. Vail, are you prepared to proceed
with your first witness?

01:37:45.944 --> 01:37:49.071
Yes, Your Honor.
The Defense calls John Shaughnessy.

01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:56.036
The People object, Your Honor.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.121
Mr. Shaughnessy has never been
identified as a possible witness.

01:37:58.206 --> 01:37:59.998
- Your Honor, may I approach?
- Yes, you may.

01:38:00.083 --> 01:38:01.458
Thank you.

01:38:05.046 --> 01:38:08.215
My client is on trial for his life, here.
He's always maintained that there was

01:38:08.299 --> 01:38:10.968
- someone else in that bedroom.
- And you think Mr. Shaughnessy

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:12.344
can somehow confirm that?

01:38:12.428 --> 01:38:14.388
Your Honor,
the Constitution of the United States

01:38:14.472 --> 01:38:15.889
takes precedence here,

01:38:15.974 --> 01:38:19.059
permitting the calling of any witness
to promulgate evidence of innocence.

01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:21.520
That's clearly stated
in the Sixth Amendment.

01:38:21.604 --> 01:38:23.939
It's also profound in Brady vs. Maryland.

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:28.485
Mr. Shaughnessy,
do you serve on the board

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:31.446
of an organization known
as the Rushman Foundation?

01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:33.657
I have the privilege to be
an honorary board member.

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:36.827
Could you briefly explain the nature
and purpose of this foundation?

01:38:36.911 --> 01:38:39.788
The Rushman Foundation was founded
by the late archbishop.

01:38:39.872 --> 01:38:44.251
Its purpose is to invest in projects
for the greater good of the community.

01:38:44.335 --> 01:38:46.670
The greater good
of the community, okay.

01:38:47.171 --> 01:38:51.633
Now, would that be true
in the case of the now bankrupt

01:38:51.718 --> 01:38:54.761
- South River Housing Development?
- Yes.

01:38:54.846 --> 01:38:59.141
Could you tell the court why the
South River project was abandoned?

01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:02.352
There was a difference of opinion
as to the costs.

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:05.063
Wasn't there also
a difference of opinion

01:39:05.148 --> 01:39:08.442
between the investors
and the late archbishop himself?

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:11.528
- I don't recall.
- Well...

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:15.532
What kind of money
are we talking about here? I mean...

01:39:18.494 --> 01:39:20.871
How much money, Mr. Shaughnessy,

01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:25.834
was invested in this failed
South River enterprise?

01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:32.299
- $60 million.
- Quiet.

01:39:32.383 --> 01:39:34.760
$60 million!

01:39:36.304 --> 01:39:38.263
Wow, that's a lot of money.

01:39:39.682 --> 01:39:42.643
You and the Archbishop
have been friends for, what, 20 years?

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:45.145
I think it's safe to say the two of you
knew each other really well.

01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:46.229
That's right.

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:48.106
Were you surprised at the content
of that tape

01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:50.150
- that Miss Venable submitted?
- Yes, of course I was.

01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:52.152
So you've never heard any allegations,

01:39:52.236 --> 01:39:54.321
charges against the Archbishop
during that time?

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:55.864
Not that I recall, no.

01:39:55.948 --> 01:39:59.326
No, especially since you were the
State's Attorney for the last 15 years,

01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:02.663
it'd be fair to say that you've supervised
all the prosecutions

01:40:02.747 --> 01:40:04.289
in Cook County during that time,

01:40:04.374 --> 01:40:07.334
especially the prosecutions
of all the prominent figures.

01:40:07.418 --> 01:40:10.629
I also have a staff of 1,000
of the best prosecutors...

01:40:10.713 --> 01:40:15.717
Yeah, yeah, but as State's Attorney,
it was up to you, ultimately, to decide

01:40:15.802 --> 01:40:17.344
who would be indicted
and who wouldn't.

01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:19.096
- Yes.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:40:21.349 --> 01:40:24.017
Let me just take you back now.

01:40:24.102 --> 01:40:28.730
Let's go back to June, 1985.

01:40:29.065 --> 01:40:32.484
Do you recall any allegations
of sexual misconduct

01:40:32.568 --> 01:40:36.029
- against the Archbishop at that time?
- I don't recall that, no.

01:40:36.114 --> 01:40:40.492
No? Do you recall a young man
by the name of Michael O'Donnell

01:40:40.576 --> 01:40:45.122
who came to the felony review unit
at your office?

01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:51.211
I have no idea what you're talking about,

01:40:51.295 --> 01:40:52.671
- Counselor.
- You don't?

01:40:52.755 --> 01:40:54.381
This is so confusing to me,

01:40:54.465 --> 01:40:57.384
because I have this document here

01:40:57.468 --> 01:40:59.761
from the Chicago Metropolitan
Police Department,

01:40:59.846 --> 01:41:03.890
and it says that, yes, Michael O'Donnell
spoke to the supervisor of that unit

01:41:03.975 --> 01:41:07.728
over a period of two weeks,
explaining to him, in graphic detail,

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:11.440
sexual abuse he suffered
at the hands of Archbishop Rushman.

01:41:11.524 --> 01:41:12.524
Quiet.

01:41:12.608 --> 01:41:16.737
Isn鈥檛 it also true, Mr. State's Attorney,
that you then decided that your friend,

01:41:16.821 --> 01:41:20.323
Archbishop Rushman,
was not going to stand trial for any of it?

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:23.994
He owed you big time, John.

01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:27.831
You must have been really pissed off
when he pulled out of South River.

01:41:28.166 --> 01:41:29.332
What happened? What was it?

01:41:29.417 --> 01:41:32.043
He just finally said,
"I can't take it anymore"? He said, "No!"

01:41:32.128 --> 01:41:34.463
- Mr. Vail.
- So you and your investors...

01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:36.798
- Mr. Vail.
- ...had 60 million reasons to kill him!

01:41:36.883 --> 01:41:39.384
- You little cocksucker!
- That's it. Witness dismissed.

01:41:39.469 --> 01:41:42.095
This court's in recess.
Vail, in my chambers now.

01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.056
That's for Joey Pinero,
you little shithead.

01:41:49.187 --> 01:41:50.854
Start looking for a job.

01:42:00.907 --> 01:42:04.576
If you think you can use my courtroom
to wage personal vendettas

01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:07.704
and settle old scores,
you are sorely mistaken.

01:42:08.289 --> 01:42:11.583
I'm striking Shaughnessy's testimony
from the record as irrelevant,

01:42:11.667 --> 01:42:14.544
and I'm holding you in contempt
to the tune of $10,000.

01:42:15.213 --> 01:42:18.799
So what you're telling me is, I can't get
a fair trial in your courtroom, is that it?

01:42:18.883 --> 01:42:22.511
Be very, very careful, Mr. Vail.
You're on dangerous ground here.

01:42:22.595 --> 01:42:25.305
Fine, fine. You want me to make
that check out to you, Judge?

01:42:25.389 --> 01:42:27.599
Do you want me
to take you off this case?

01:42:27.934 --> 01:42:31.603
You're making a mockery of my
courtroom, and I'm not going to allow it.

01:42:31.771 --> 01:42:36.900
I suggest you start representing your
client and stop representing yourself.

01:42:45.952 --> 01:42:47.035
...do this later?

01:42:47.119 --> 01:42:49.913
No, I want to stay with this for a minute.

01:42:51.082 --> 01:42:55.085
- I'm feeling very, very tired.
- Yeah, I know.

01:42:55.419 --> 01:42:58.088
Why does talking
about Linda Forbes upset you?

01:42:59.215 --> 01:43:00.841
It doesn't. I just...

01:43:01.968 --> 01:43:05.136
- Okay, okay.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:43:08.558 --> 01:43:10.892
Hey, you know what I can do
with this thing?

01:43:10.977 --> 01:43:12.769
How the fuck should I know?

01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:25.866
Dr. Arrington, how much time
have you spent with Aaron Stampler?

01:43:26.158 --> 01:43:27.617
Around 60 hours.

01:43:27.702 --> 01:43:30.537
And what did you find
in the course of your evaluation?

01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:34.374
I found that Mr. Stampler suffers from
an acute disassociative condition,

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:36.877
specifically,
multiple personality disorder.

01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:38.128
Objection, Your Honor.

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:41.214
Now, Dr. Arrington is only stating what
she herself has personally observed.

01:43:41.299 --> 01:43:43.174
- Your Honor.
- Counselors.

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:48.138
- Now, I know what you're doing.
- Will you excuse us for a minute?

01:43:50.808 --> 01:43:52.809
Your Honor, if he wants to question
his client's sanity...

01:43:52.894 --> 01:43:56.187
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish
a medical basis for amnesia here.

01:43:56.272 --> 01:43:59.399
That is not what he's doing.
He's saying he's crazy.

01:43:59.775 --> 01:44:03.320
- Are you?
- No, I am not.

01:44:03.404 --> 01:44:07.574
I'll allow you to proceed with
this witness if you're very, very careful.

01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:10.827
Absolutely. Yes.

01:44:10.912 --> 01:44:13.038
Write down that he said that.

01:44:13.539 --> 01:44:15.040
All right, where were we?

01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:24.132
Now, could Aaron Stampler

01:44:24.216 --> 01:44:28.762
have been present during the murder
of Archbishop Rushman

01:44:28.846 --> 01:44:30.847
- and not remember it?
- Yes, he could.

01:44:30.932 --> 01:44:33.016
Okay. Could you explain that, please?

01:44:33.225 --> 01:44:35.769
Mr. Stampler's state at the time
of the offense was such that

01:44:35.853 --> 01:44:37.938
his body could be present at a homicide

01:44:38.022 --> 01:44:40.440
and yet his mind
would be unable to recall it.

01:44:40.858 --> 01:44:43.360
- And how is that possible?
- The neurological mechanism

01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:46.196
that would make this possible
began with the early abuse

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.031
suffered at the hands of his father.

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:50.533
In defense, Aaron's psyche splintered

01:44:50.618 --> 01:44:53.578
and helped him to create
two separate personalities.

01:44:53.663 --> 01:44:55.705
- Your Honor.
- I didn't say it.

01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:58.458
- I did not say it...
- You've been warned twice now.

01:44:58.542 --> 01:45:00.502
Do you really wanna pursue
this line of questioning?

01:45:00.586 --> 01:45:04.047
And I suggest you think long and hard
before answering.

01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:09.260
Your Honor, just one last question.

01:45:14.183 --> 01:45:16.226
All right, Dr. Arrington,

01:45:17.687 --> 01:45:22.649
in your opinion,
is Aaron Stampler capable of murder?

01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:24.567
No, he is not. He is far too traumatized

01:45:24.652 --> 01:45:26.820
to express normal anger and frustration.

01:45:26.904 --> 01:45:28.989
He keeps his emotions repressed,

01:45:29.073 --> 01:45:31.658
which is why he created Roy,
who is capable of such a crime.

01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:34.244
- Objection, Your Honor.
- That's enough, Mr. Vail.

01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:38.039
The jury will disregard this witness'
last statement, as will the court.

01:45:38.124 --> 01:45:39.416
- Thank you very much.
- Madam Prosecutor,

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:42.043
- do you wish to cross?
- You bet I do.

01:45:44.422 --> 01:45:47.841
Since you brought it up,
against the instructions of the court,

01:45:47.925 --> 01:45:49.342
I'm curious to know,

01:45:49.427 --> 01:45:52.846
is multiple personality disorder
your primary area of expertise?

01:45:52.930 --> 01:45:54.973
It's not my primary field, no.

01:45:55.057 --> 01:45:58.601
Is forensic psychiatry
your primary area of expertise?

01:45:59.103 --> 01:46:01.604
- No, I'm a neuropsychologist.
- I see.

01:46:02.023 --> 01:46:04.941
So you have no forensic experience,

01:46:05.026 --> 01:46:08.611
and you're more of, let's say,
an academic?

01:46:09.989 --> 01:46:13.283
Then you will forgive
this rather academic question.

01:46:13.951 --> 01:46:16.995
I'm driving in my car,
somebody cuts me off.

01:46:17.079 --> 01:46:19.039
I think to myself,
"I could just kill that guy,"

01:46:19.123 --> 01:46:20.707
but I don't, now do I?

01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:22.625
- I would hope not.
- That's right.

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:26.379
Things happen to us. People wrong us,

01:46:26.464 --> 01:46:28.923
but we don't all go around
inventing psychopaths

01:46:29.008 --> 01:46:31.009
to do our dirty work for us,
now, do we, Doctor?

01:46:31.093 --> 01:46:34.262
I'm not suggesting you suffer from
multiple personality, Miss Venable.

01:46:34.346 --> 01:46:37.223
- I'm saying Mr. Stampler does.
- Yes, I know. We heard.

01:46:39.185 --> 01:46:43.480
You have also testified
that you have met this...

01:46:43.564 --> 01:46:44.898
What was his name again?

01:46:44.982 --> 01:46:46.399
- Roy.
- Roy what?

01:46:46.984 --> 01:46:49.235
- He didn't give a last name.
- I see.

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.406
Did this Roy tell you
that he had murdered the Archbishop?

01:46:53.491 --> 01:46:56.117
Mr. Vail was alone with him at the time.
I was watching through the window,

01:46:56.202 --> 01:46:59.370
but soon after that I was in the room
and saw both Roy

01:46:59.455 --> 01:47:01.790
and his transformation back to Aaron.

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:08.254
Did you happen to tape
this appearance of Aaron...

01:47:09.673 --> 01:47:14.177
I'm sorry. I am sorry.
I just cannot get used to this name.

01:47:14.261 --> 01:47:16.679
- Roy.
- Did you?

01:47:18.474 --> 01:47:21.184
- No, the tape was off.
- Off?

01:47:23.395 --> 01:47:28.399
So you have no record whatsoever
of his appearance.

01:47:28.692 --> 01:47:29.943
- No.
- No.

01:47:32.363 --> 01:47:35.115
Does Aaron Stampler know
the difference between right and wrong?

01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:36.241
Yes, he does.

01:47:36.325 --> 01:47:39.077
If Aaron Stampler butchered
the Archbishop, would he know...

01:47:39.161 --> 01:47:40.286
Objection, Your Honor.

01:47:40.371 --> 01:47:43.748
If Aaron Stampler
murdered the Archbishop,

01:47:43.833 --> 01:47:48.253
- would he know he'd broken the law?
- Yes, he would, but it wasn't Aaron...

01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:52.465
Yes, I know, Doctor. It was Roy.

01:47:55.761 --> 01:47:59.055
That's all.
No further questions, Your Honor.

01:47:59.181 --> 01:48:00.640
Witness may step down.

01:48:00.724 --> 01:48:03.726
Miss Venable, if you would like to
re-open the Prosecution's case

01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:05.311
and call the State's psychiatrist,

01:48:05.396 --> 01:48:08.565
- I will certainly agree to it.
- No, I...

01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:10.233
I don't think that's necessary,
Your Honor.

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:12.068
I think we all get the picture here.

01:48:12.903 --> 01:48:16.322
Mr. Vail, are you ready to proceed?

01:48:19.118 --> 01:48:20.910
Would you like a recess?

01:49:26.227 --> 01:49:27.310
Roy?

01:49:28.812 --> 01:49:29.979
Aaron.

01:49:33.943 --> 01:49:36.027
Could you tell us a little about
your relationship

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:37.987
with Archbishop Rushman?

01:49:38.572 --> 01:49:43.284
Well, he was like a father to me.
I loved him very much.

01:49:43.369 --> 01:49:45.078
Why did you love him?

01:49:45.663 --> 01:49:46.829
Why?

01:49:48.123 --> 01:49:52.085
Well, he saved my life.

01:49:52.336 --> 01:49:57.298
He was the only person who ever
treated me like I was worth anything.

01:49:57.675 --> 01:50:00.426
Stop your whining, you little girl.
Be a man.

01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:07.517
Now, we've all seen that tape
that you were in, Aaron.

01:50:08.477 --> 01:50:09.852
How did that make you feel?

01:50:09.937 --> 01:50:12.730
Did it change your feelings
about Archbishop Rushman?

01:50:13.023 --> 01:50:14.023
No.

01:50:15.401 --> 01:50:18.194
He was a wonderful man.

01:50:18.279 --> 01:50:19.904
So you didn't feel anger towards him

01:50:19.989 --> 01:50:22.365
about being forced to perform
in that tape?

01:50:23.033 --> 01:50:26.869
No, he did everything for me.

01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:30.123
There wasn't nothing else
I could do for him, and he needed it.

01:50:30.207 --> 01:50:32.458
Do you know someone named Roy?

01:50:35.504 --> 01:50:36.879
No, I don't.

01:50:37.631 --> 01:50:40.425
You heard Dr. Arrington's
testimony about

01:50:40.509 --> 01:50:42.760
what she and I saw there at the jail.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:46.055
Aaron, some pretty strange things
going on there. Do you remember?

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:48.516
I heard what she said,
but I don't remember any of that.

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.435
- No recollection?
- No, sir.

01:50:50.519 --> 01:50:52.854
Did you kill Archbishop Rushman?

01:50:54.857 --> 01:50:56.733
No, sir, I did not.

01:51:02.698 --> 01:51:03.781
Thank you.

01:51:06.618 --> 01:51:08.077
Your witness.

01:51:15.586 --> 01:51:18.212
Mr. Stampler,
would you like some water?

01:51:22.217 --> 01:51:24.761
- No, ma'am.
- You sure?

01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:28.473
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

01:51:36.398 --> 01:51:40.526
Mr. Stampler, did you believe
that the Archbishop wore masks?

01:51:43.655 --> 01:51:45.782
I'm sorry, what did you say?

01:51:46.075 --> 01:51:50.203
Do you think he acted one way
in public and another way in private?

01:51:51.246 --> 01:51:53.247
No, I didn't think that.

01:51:54.083 --> 01:51:56.459
Isn鈥檛 that why you underlined
the Hawthorne passage?

01:51:59.004 --> 01:52:00.421
Mr. Stampler?

01:52:03.384 --> 01:52:05.343
No, I did not underline that book.

01:52:05.427 --> 01:52:08.137
- You didn't underline it?
- No, ma'am.

01:52:08.222 --> 01:52:11.766
And you didn't carve the numbers
referring to that passage into his chest?

01:52:11.850 --> 01:52:15.728
No, no, ma'am, I did not. I told you I...

01:52:15.813 --> 01:52:17.313
You loved him.

01:52:18.732 --> 01:52:20.858
You loved him like a father.

01:52:21.151 --> 01:52:24.654
Even though he made you
and your girlfriend

01:52:24.738 --> 01:52:28.157
perform demeaning sexual acts
for his own gratification.

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:30.952
No, you don't understand. He...

01:52:31.995 --> 01:52:36.082
There was no other way for him
to cast out his own demons.

01:52:36.166 --> 01:52:38.709
- He needed it.
- He needed to get off, Aaron.

01:52:38.794 --> 01:52:40.128
That's what he was doing.

01:52:40.212 --> 01:52:44.424
That's what he needed you for,
to perform like a circus animal.

01:52:44.508 --> 01:52:47.218
- That was your function in his life.
- No.

01:52:47.302 --> 01:52:51.097
Mr. Stampler, I'm gonna ask you
straight, because I am tired,

01:52:51.181 --> 01:52:53.641
and I've had just about
all I can take of this sordidness,

01:52:53.725 --> 01:52:54.934
and I wanna go home,

01:52:55.018 --> 01:52:59.272
and I wanna wash my hands,
and I wanna forget all about you

01:52:59.356 --> 01:53:01.441
and Archbishop Rushman.

01:53:01.525 --> 01:53:05.361
Did the Archbishop force you
and your girlfriend and others

01:53:05.446 --> 01:53:09.282
to perform sexual acts
while he watched? Yes or no?

01:53:12.202 --> 01:53:15.121
- Yes, he did, but...
- Yes. Yes, he forced you.

01:53:15.539 --> 01:53:19.208
He forced you using a threat
of expulsion from Savior House

01:53:19.293 --> 01:53:23.671
and a life on the street with no heat
and no water and no food.

01:53:23.755 --> 01:53:27.842
He put you in front of a camera!
He made you take off your clothes!

01:53:27.926 --> 01:53:30.678
And you don't think that
that's another side?

01:53:31.138 --> 01:53:32.930
Another face of a man
that we all thought...

01:53:33.015 --> 01:53:34.891
- No! No.
- Do you know what I would do

01:53:34.975 --> 01:53:37.477
if someone did that to me?
I would kill him. I wouldn't hesitate.

01:53:37.561 --> 01:53:39.020
- No.
- I would stab him

01:53:39.104 --> 01:53:40.897
78 times with a butcher knife!

01:53:40.981 --> 01:53:44.150
I would chop off his fingers!
I would slash his throat open!

01:53:44.234 --> 01:53:45.985
I would carve numbers into his chest!

01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:49.113
I would gouge out his eyes!
I swear to God.

01:53:51.241 --> 01:53:52.742
But that's me.

01:54:01.752 --> 01:54:03.002
No further questions, Your Honor.

01:54:03.086 --> 01:54:04.504
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

01:54:04.588 --> 01:54:05.796
- Excuse me?
- Hey, you look at me

01:54:05.881 --> 01:54:08.257
- when I'm talking to you, bitch!
- Mr. Stampler.

01:54:08.342 --> 01:54:10.092
- Fuck you, lady! Come here!
- That's it.

01:54:10.177 --> 01:54:12.053
Order! Bailiff! Order!

01:54:13.138 --> 01:54:17.558
Come here! You wanna play rough?
Let's play rough. Come on. Back off!

01:54:17.643 --> 01:54:20.102
- Roy! Take it easy.
- Keep coming, asshole.

01:54:20.187 --> 01:54:22.188
You'll see if I don't break
her fucking neck.

01:54:22.272 --> 01:54:24.023
- Roy, come here. I gotta talk to you.
- Fuck you, Marty!

01:54:24.107 --> 01:54:26.567
- I'm walking out of here. Now, slow...
- It's me.

01:54:31.323 --> 01:54:34.033
No! No! Don't you...

01:54:35.619 --> 01:54:36.619
No!

01:54:42.459 --> 01:54:44.835
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

01:55:11.947 --> 01:55:14.615
Don't even think of lighting
that cigarette, Miss Venable.

01:55:20.664 --> 01:55:23.332
- How's your neck?
- I'll live.

01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:25.209
I could call a doctor.

01:55:25.711 --> 01:55:30.798
Mr. Shaughnessy just called
to inform me there will be no mistrial,

01:55:30.882 --> 01:55:33.217
- as if that was his right.
- I can't believe

01:55:33.302 --> 01:55:35.678
that scumbag has the balls to call here.

01:55:35.846 --> 01:55:37.013
No, thanks.

01:55:37.389 --> 01:55:39.890
What matters to me is
what you have to say.

01:55:39.975 --> 01:55:42.393
Obviously,
your case has been damaged.

01:55:43.937 --> 01:55:46.772
In fairness to the Prosecution,
I would declare a mistrial,

01:55:46.857 --> 01:55:49.525
regardless of what
Monsieurs Shaughnessy and Vail think,

01:55:49.610 --> 01:55:51.068
if that's what you want.

01:55:51.153 --> 01:55:54.155
The Prosecution doesn't wanna try
this case again, even if it could,

01:55:54.239 --> 01:55:57.283
which it can't, at least not by me.

01:55:57.367 --> 01:56:00.202
And I think I can guarantee you
there's no one

01:56:00.370 --> 01:56:05.708
in the DA's office who will,
so it's up to you.

01:56:06.168 --> 01:56:08.669
I'm going to dismiss the jury
in favor of a bench trial

01:56:08.754 --> 01:56:11.297
and a blind plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity.

01:56:11.381 --> 01:56:12.882
- Yes?
- Yeah.

01:56:12.966 --> 01:56:14.967
The defendant will be
remanded to Elgin

01:56:15.052 --> 01:56:17.053
for an evaluation period of 30 days.

01:56:17.137 --> 01:56:19.472
Let them decide
the term of his commitment.

01:56:19.556 --> 01:56:21.015
Do either of you have
a problem with that?

01:56:21.099 --> 01:56:22.767
Your Honor, he'll be out in a month.

01:56:22.851 --> 01:56:25.853
Take it up with the Legislature,
Miss Venable.

01:56:28.857 --> 01:56:30.399
I'm going home.

01:56:35.530 --> 01:56:37.239
- Your Honor.
- No, Mr. Vail,

01:56:37.324 --> 01:56:39.784
I am not refunding your contempt fine,

01:56:39.868 --> 01:56:42.328
and the next time you wanna get
a client off on insanity,

01:56:42.412 --> 01:56:43.871
you plead that way,

01:56:43.955 --> 01:56:46.082
or I'll have you disbarred.

01:57:14.695 --> 01:57:19.073
- You okay?
- Am I okay? Do I seem okay?

01:57:19.616 --> 01:57:22.993
I get attacked by this sick twist,
I've lost the case, I'm out of a job.

01:57:23.078 --> 01:57:26.831
No, Marty. I'm not particularly okay,
but, hey, you won,

01:57:26.915 --> 01:57:29.875
justice was done.
Who the hell cares, right?

01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.003
Congratulations.

01:57:39.386 --> 01:57:41.178
You knew, didn't you?

01:57:41.555 --> 01:57:44.390
You knew if I went after him,
he'd wig out up there.

01:57:44.474 --> 01:57:48.227
Well, I knew he'd come out
if he was threatened.

01:57:48.311 --> 01:57:50.563
And who better to do that than me?

01:57:51.815 --> 01:57:53.232
You used me.

01:57:57.446 --> 01:57:59.572
Yeah, I did. I had no choice.

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:05.619
What did I use, by the way,
that was so terrible?

01:58:05.912 --> 01:58:09.749
I knew you'd do your job.
I knew you'd stand up to Shaughnessy.

01:58:09.958 --> 01:58:12.877
I knew you'd try to win the case.
Now, what's wrong with that?

01:58:12.961 --> 01:58:14.754
I lost my fucking job!

01:58:14.838 --> 01:58:16.547
And that's good.
You should've left him years ago.

01:58:16.631 --> 01:58:19.592
Christ, Marty, why is it you always think
you know what's right for me?

01:58:19.676 --> 01:58:21.135
Because I'm arrogant.

01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:24.555
I'm very,

01:58:26.391 --> 01:58:28.350
very arrogant.

01:58:39.196 --> 01:58:41.030
- You wanna dance?
- No.

01:58:42.574 --> 01:58:43.991
- Sure?
- Yeah.

01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:49.705
All you have to do is turn around.

01:58:55.378 --> 01:58:56.420
No.

01:58:58.548 --> 01:58:59.715
No.

01:59:09.309 --> 01:59:11.268
I have to see my client.

01:59:54.855 --> 01:59:57.231
- I'd like a minute alone with him.
- Are you sure?

01:59:57.315 --> 01:59:59.024
Yeah. I'm sure.

02:00:10.829 --> 02:00:12.037
You okay?

02:00:15.959 --> 02:00:17.459
My head hurts.

02:00:19.004 --> 02:00:21.630
You don't remember
what just happened?

02:00:24.968 --> 02:00:30.014
- No?
- I lost time again.

02:00:31.057 --> 02:00:33.517
Well, I got some good news.

02:00:34.644 --> 02:00:36.562
They've agreed to stop the trial.

02:00:36.646 --> 02:00:39.231
They're gonna be sending you
to a hospital.

02:00:39.733 --> 02:00:41.358
You can get the help you need.

02:00:43.278 --> 02:00:48.157
Now, there's a very good chance
you can get out someday soon.

02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:52.703
Yeah.

02:00:57.417 --> 02:00:59.209
I can't believe it.

02:01:00.170 --> 02:01:04.340
- I don't know what to say, Mr. Vail.
- That's all right, Aaron. That's okay.

02:01:04.424 --> 02:01:07.301
I knew, the minute
you came into my cell,

02:01:07.385 --> 02:01:10.137
I knew everything was gonna be okay.

02:01:10.221 --> 02:01:12.848
You saved my life.

02:01:16.853 --> 02:01:18.103
Yeah.

02:01:19.898 --> 02:01:21.315
I got to go.

02:01:23.693 --> 02:01:28.405
- When will I see you again?
- Well, that's up to the courts now.

02:01:29.991 --> 02:01:33.786
I don't want you to worry, Aaron.
I'm gonna stay on top of this, okay?

02:01:40.710 --> 02:01:42.044
Thank you.

02:01:43.296 --> 02:01:46.131
All right. You give me a call
if you need to. Okay?

02:01:46.216 --> 02:01:47.591
- I will.
- All right.

02:01:50.762 --> 02:01:52.930
- Hey, Mr. Vail?
- Yeah.

02:01:54.724 --> 02:01:58.936
Will you tell Miss Venable I'm sorry?

02:02:00.772 --> 02:02:03.565
Tell her I hope her neck is okay.

02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:05.734
Yeah.

02:02:22.752 --> 02:02:26.255
- What did you just say?
- What?

02:02:27.716 --> 02:02:30.718
You told me you don't remember.
You black out.

02:02:34.264 --> 02:02:36.682
So how do you know about her neck?

02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:55.409
Well, good for you, Marty.

02:02:57.078 --> 02:02:58.954
I was gonna let it go.

02:02:59.122 --> 02:03:02.499
You was looking so happy just now.
I was thinking...

02:03:03.626 --> 02:03:06.045
But to tell you the truth,
I'm glad you figured it,

02:03:06.129 --> 02:03:08.714
'cause I have been dying to tell you.

02:03:09.716 --> 02:03:11.675
I just didn't know who
you'd wanna hear it from, you know.

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:14.803
I mean, Aaron or Roy, or Roy or Aaron.

02:03:15.263 --> 02:03:17.181
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret,

02:03:17.265 --> 02:03:21.143
sort of a client-attorney privilege type
of a secret. You know what I mean?

02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:25.773
It don't matter who you hear it from.
It's the same story.

02:03:30.403 --> 02:03:33.489
I just

02:03:33.573 --> 02:03:35.657
had to kill Linda, Mr. Vail.

02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:39.787
That cunt just got what she deserved.

02:03:43.166 --> 02:03:47.211
But cutting up
that son of a bitch Rushman,

02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:52.091
that was just a fucking work of art.

02:04:00.391 --> 02:04:02.726
You're good. You are really good.

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:06.355
Yeah, I did get caught, though, didn't I?

02:04:10.568 --> 02:04:14.696
So there never...
There never was a Roy?

02:04:16.032 --> 02:04:20.077
Jesus Christ, Marty. If that's
what you think, I'm disappointed in you.

02:04:20.161 --> 02:04:21.787
I don't mind telling you.

02:04:24.541 --> 02:04:28.836
There never was an Aaron, Counselor.

02:04:37.804 --> 02:04:40.180
Come on, Marty, I thought you had it
figured there at the end.

02:04:40.265 --> 02:04:41.640
The way you put me
on the stand like that,

02:04:41.724 --> 02:04:43.684
that was fucking brilliant, Marty.

02:04:43.768 --> 02:04:45.352
And that whole thing,
that, "Act like a man,"

02:04:45.436 --> 02:04:47.646
Jesus, I knew exactly
what you wanted from me.

02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:49.857
It was like we were dancing, Marty!

02:04:49.941 --> 02:04:52.401
- Guard.
- Come on. Don't be like that, Marty.

02:04:53.862 --> 02:04:58.407
We did it, man. We fucking did it.
We're a great team, you and me.

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.451
You think I could've done this
without you?

02:05:01.536 --> 02:05:03.036
You're just feeling a little anger here

02:05:03.121 --> 02:05:05.956
because you started to care about
old Aaron. I can understand that,

02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:10.127
but, you know, love hurts, Marty.
What can I say?

02:05:11.045 --> 02:05:14.673
Hey, I'm just kidding, bud!
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings!

02:05:14.757 --> 02:05:17.092
What else was I supposed to do?

02:05:17.427 --> 02:05:18.927
Hey, you're gonna thank me
down the road,

02:05:19.012 --> 02:05:21.930
'cause this is gonna toughen you
right up, Martin Vail!
