Can we please go home now?

10:13.290 --> 10:15.670
Benjamin's right.

10:15.670 --> 10:17.130
[SIGHS] I know.

10:17.130 --> 10:18.600
I just really wanted that plum.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.640
We can always try
to find the thief

10:20.640 --> 10:21.960
and get that plum tomorrow.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.700
And if anyone can find
someone who needs finding,

10:25.700 --> 10:26.980
it's Peter Rabbit.

10:26.980 --> 10:27.760
I suppose.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.040
Is everything
all right, Peter?

10:37.040 --> 10:39.270
Yes, um, maybe.

10:39.270 --> 10:41.630
Oh, not really.

10:41.630 --> 10:43.760
Remember that friend
I told you about,

10:43.760 --> 10:47.460
who wanted to get that plum
from Mr. McGregor's tree?

10:47.460 --> 10:48.720
It was me.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.060
You?

10:50.060 --> 10:50.760
Really?

10:50.760 --> 10:52.460
I'm sorry, mum.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.570
I went back to get
it, but someone

10:54.570 --> 10:58.860
really fast, really clever, and
really brave got there first.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.800
Now, we'll never know
who the thief was,

11:00.800 --> 11:02.430
and I'll never get
to eat that plum.

11:02.430 --> 11:06.350
Uh, uh, uh, never say
never, Peter Rabbit.

11:06.350 --> 11:07.640
[GASPS] Plum pie?

11:07.640 --> 11:08.340
Yum!

11:13.260 --> 11:16.490
But wait a minute.

11:16.490 --> 11:20.850
Fast, clever, brave-- you?

11:20.850 --> 11:23.770
It was you all along?

11:23.770 --> 11:28.640
[CHUCKLES] It's best if you
eat it while it's still warm.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.690
Good?

11:29.690 --> 11:30.660
The best.

11:30.660 --> 11:31.360
[LAUGHS]

11:33.460 --> 11:35.860
[LAUGHTER]

11:39.760 --> 11:40.660
