WEBVTT

00:08.142 --> 00:11.545
Seems like forever
since my trial.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.114
Ten years.

00:15.116 --> 00:18.586
They kept showing this picture
of what he looked like before.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.589
Lieutenant O'Connell.

00:24.525 --> 00:28.429
They talked about
how he was brave,

00:28.462 --> 00:31.499
how he served
his country,

00:31.532 --> 00:34.468
how he took his mother out
for dinner every Sunday.

00:36.670 --> 00:40.608
Then they showed the picture
of him after he was gone.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.511
He was wearing
his uniform,

00:43.544 --> 00:45.713
and his head...

00:47.515 --> 00:48.416
(gavel banging)

00:48.449 --> 00:51.585
I see that picture
when I close my eyes.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.587
(gavel banging)
MAN: Order!

00:53.621 --> 00:55.289
Order in this courtroom!

00:55.323 --> 00:57.125
(gavel banging)

00:57.158 --> 00:59.660
They said he was
bound and dragged.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.529
I imagine it in my head.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.697
(crying):
No, please! Please, no!

01:06.234 --> 01:09.670
He was hit so hard,
the side of his head caved in.

01:09.703 --> 01:10.704
O'CONNELL:
No!

01:13.841 --> 01:15.676
HICKS:
I imagine it all.

01:15.709 --> 01:19.613
Everything they said,

01:19.647 --> 01:21.315
everything they showed
in that courtroom--

01:21.349 --> 01:24.285
it's in my head,
and it won't go away.

01:24.318 --> 01:27.421
And everyone who looks at me...

01:29.223 --> 01:31.525
...they think I did that to him.

01:31.559 --> 01:35.229
Did you, Gabriel?

01:35.263 --> 01:37.731
Did you murder
Lieutenant O'Connell?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.669
No.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.174
Then start from the beginning.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.242
Tell me how you ended up here.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.514
I was framed.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.416
By who?

01:55.449 --> 01:57.651
NCIS.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.191
*

02:33.321 --> 02:34.422
Morning, Bishop.

02:34.455 --> 02:38.292
Hey, McGee, cannot wait to
work with you today, bud.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.660
Why are you
so chipper?

02:39.693 --> 02:41.395
Well, Bishop,

02:41.429 --> 02:43.964
I woke up this morning,
and I realized that

02:43.997 --> 02:47.268
all of my T-shirts
are too small.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.769
Well, I could've
told you that.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.338
They're practically
child-sized.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.339
No, man.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.440
It's my arms.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.908
My biceps are
gaining inches, man.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.346
All those reps are...
are really paying off, baby.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.447
I woke up this morning,

02:59.480 --> 03:00.814
I looked down at my arms,

03:00.848 --> 03:02.416
and you know when you know?

03:02.450 --> 03:03.917
I-I just knew

03:03.951 --> 03:08.222
that today was gonna be
a great day, for all of us.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.923
So all of us are gonna have
a great day

03:09.957 --> 03:11.259
because of your muscles?

03:11.292 --> 03:12.993
Mm-hmm.
SLOANE: Hey, Nick.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.328
Incoming.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.564
What the hell?

03:16.597 --> 03:18.232
It's a gift.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.334
Foxy Feet Pedicure Kit,

03:20.368 --> 03:22.503
as seen on TV.
Buy one, get one free.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.904
So, you're welcome.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.439
Wait. This is

03:25.473 --> 03:26.874
for your feet.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.476
Why would I want this?

03:28.509 --> 03:30.511
I could've sworn
you were the type

03:30.544 --> 03:32.446
who self-pedicured
at least once a week.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.581
You know the drill.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.949
Well, I don't know
the drill, but, uh,

03:35.983 --> 03:38.586
thank you, I guess.
I-I don't think so.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.422
Got it. As you were.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.324
You know, I bet
you would go to great lengths

03:43.357 --> 03:45.393
to prevent any kind
of physical imperfection.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.760
BISHOP:
Mm-hmm, and Sloane is

03:46.794 --> 03:48.462
really good at
reading people.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.863
Oh, come on, guys.

03:49.897 --> 03:50.798
I already told you.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.733
I spend every free minute
I get in the gym.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.568
I don't have time
to do this kind of stuff.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.704
Fine. I'll take it.
No, I'm taking it.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.006
Oh, hey, what's up, Gibbs?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.041
Dead body, boss?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.910
Nope.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.015
Special Agent Gibbs.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.650
Jessica Shaeffer,
federal public defender.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.652
Pleasure.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.522
I'll assume you won't mind
if I forego the B.S.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.657
No.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.559
Six months ago,
I took on the case

04:18.592 --> 04:20.361
of a man named
Gabriel Hicks.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.464
He was convicted of
kidnapping, robbing

04:23.497 --> 04:25.699
and murdering Navy Lieutenant
Edward O'Connell.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.001
Hicks was
wrongfully convicted.

04:28.035 --> 04:31.439
He served ten years on death row
for a crime he didn't commit.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.374
O'Connell's murder
was before my time.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.676
I thought maybe you could
fill in the blanks, Gibbs.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.078
Wasn't my case.
But you remember it.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.480
Joint investigation

04:39.513 --> 04:40.914
with the FBI.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.584
If she thinks
Hicks is innocent...

04:43.617 --> 04:46.053
She thinks that we botched
the investigation.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.088
Actually, I thought
you framed him.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.923
Luckily for you,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.525
I found no evidence of that.

04:51.559 --> 04:55.829
But what I have found are
some rather jumbled reports

04:55.863 --> 04:57.565
written by the NCIS point.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.899
Special Agent Mark Mason.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.434
Died of a heart attack

05:00.468 --> 05:01.635
five years ago, I'm aware.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.471
I'm mid-trial on
this thing, Director.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.772
I have done
my homework.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.508
But Agent Mason's
not why I'm here.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.443
Okay. Then what?

05:09.477 --> 05:11.479
Lieutenant O'Connell's
autopsy report.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.447
It was completed by

05:13.481 --> 05:14.682
a second-string M.E.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.384
Ducky's mom was having surgery.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.785
He took a leave.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.787
We sent the body
to the city M.E.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.356
I received permission
to have it exhumed.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.757
Now I want
your permission

05:23.791 --> 05:26.093
to have the best
of the best take a look.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.562
I've already taken the liberty

05:28.596 --> 05:29.963
of messengering
Dr. Mallard the original

05:29.997 --> 05:33.033
copy of that report,
and the body.

05:34.735 --> 05:38.439
The great American
physician, poet and polymath

05:38.472 --> 05:41.409
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Senior,
once said,

05:41.442 --> 05:44.712
"Where we love is home,

05:44.745 --> 05:48.482
home that our feet may leave,
but not our hearts." (chuckles)

05:48.516 --> 05:51.018
In other words,
it's great to be back.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.721
This is all really lovely,
but can we...?

05:53.754 --> 05:56.557
Oh, uh, yes,
you're due back in court.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.559
Let's get started.

05:58.592 --> 06:02.596
Based on these photos
and reports, I can safely say

06:02.630 --> 06:06.567
that I agree
with your cause of death.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.635
Blunt force trauma.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.603
Yes. Here, to the side
of the head.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.573
With what appeared to be
a metal pipe.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.774
Yes. Ms. Shaeffer.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.810
You seemed to have
studied the report well.

06:16.844 --> 06:20.981
But, uh, what do
you see, Dr. Palmer?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.716
Well, the injuries

06:22.750 --> 06:25.553
and blood spatter
show that the victim was

06:25.586 --> 06:28.956
kneeling while the assailant
was standing for the fatal blow.

06:28.989 --> 06:32.092
Gentlemen, as we've established,
I know the report.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.127
I don't need it read back to me.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.497
You agree with
it, I understand.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.966
Ms. Shaeffer, the findings

06:38.999 --> 06:42.436
were correct, but, the, uh,
analysis is incomplete.

06:42.470 --> 06:46.440
Now that I see the decomposition
of the outer layers,

06:46.474 --> 06:47.908
I have a clearer picture.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.578
Clearer than
the prior M.E.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.846
You see,
the point of impact

06:52.880 --> 06:55.082
is the posterior left
and radiates

06:55.115 --> 06:57.084
down toward the temple.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.852
Now, this means
that the assailant

06:58.886 --> 07:00.954
had to be standing behind him.

07:00.988 --> 07:05.526
My colleague has just given you
a concurring second opinion.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.528
I don't understand.

07:07.561 --> 07:11.599
This injury-- it's the result
of a left-handed swing.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.535
The original M.E.
missed that fact.

07:14.568 --> 07:20.173
Ms. Shaeffer, dare we ask about
your client, Gabriel Hicks?

07:20.207 --> 07:22.576
He's right-handed.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.614
He's innocent.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.727
God, I love my life.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.529
What happened? Your
shirt get even tighter?

07:41.562 --> 07:45.633
I wish. No, Agent Sloane just,
uh, told me something, uh...

07:45.666 --> 07:47.234
It's made my day,
that's all.

07:48.702 --> 07:51.905
Well, what was it?

07:51.939 --> 07:54.608
Nah, I shouldn't say anything.
It's about you, Bishop,

07:54.642 --> 07:57.044
and it's kind of like, uh...
it's kind of embarrassing.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.746
What? Wait.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.648
You mean she was profiling me?

08:00.681 --> 08:01.915
What did she say?

08:01.949 --> 08:03.116
It was embarrassing?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.586
Embarrassing how?

08:05.619 --> 08:07.588
You really want me to say it
in front of McGee?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.089
(clears throat)

08:09.122 --> 08:10.791
Uh, these are the
O'Connell case files?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.893
Yeah, there were a lot more
than I expected.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.595
Makes sense.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.631
Agent Mason didn't input
his reports electronically.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.601
I can see why. The info is
so disorganized, I mean,

08:20.634 --> 08:22.703
it'd take forever to categorize.
TORRES: Damn it.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.606
I hate stacks
of paper.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.608
So, 11 years ago,

08:27.641 --> 08:30.611
Lieutenant Edward O'Connell
was abducted

08:30.644 --> 08:33.647
outside of his home in Virginia
by a man driving a blue van.

08:33.681 --> 08:37.651
O'Connell was forced to withdraw
$1,200 cash from his bank

08:37.685 --> 08:40.120
while the assailant waited
in the van in the parking lot.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.623
Come on.
A military guy like that?

08:42.656 --> 08:44.625
No way he'd get back in the van.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.959
He must've been
threatened somehow.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.661
O'Connell was murdered
in the forest.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.962
Body was found the next day.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.298
Fast forward a year.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.902
Gabriel Hicks was convicted
of robbery, kidnapping

08:54.935 --> 08:57.605
and first-degree murder.
Sentenced to death.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.172
Evidence?

08:59.206 --> 09:01.609
All circumstantial--
Hicks drove a blue van,

09:01.642 --> 09:03.944
and was found with
over $1,000 cash on him.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.946
He also gave a fake alibi.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.948
Said he was at his friend's
house at the time of the murder.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.583
Turns out, he was staying

09:09.617 --> 09:11.118
at a hunting cabin
near the crime scene.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.620
McGEE:
Several witnesses saw

09:12.653 --> 09:14.622
a blue van outside
the lieutenant's home

09:14.655 --> 09:16.023
before the abduction.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.058
Any of them see the driver?

09:18.091 --> 09:20.861
No, but a woman who sold fruit
in the bank parking lot

09:20.894 --> 09:23.063
was believed to have
gotten a close-up view.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.598
By the time
investigators realized

09:24.632 --> 09:25.799
she could know something,

09:25.833 --> 09:27.267
she couldn't be located.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.604
Agent Mason referred
to her as "Witness X."

09:30.638 --> 09:32.272
Torres, you have
anything to add?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.141
Crime scene photos.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.977
Let's go back to the forest
and see if we missed anything.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.746
FORNELL:
Course I remember it.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.914
I remember all the cases
I was point on.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.751
They're like
my ugly work babies.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.819
So you heard about the retrial?

09:45.853 --> 09:47.621
Yeah. Technicality.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.289
It's a real waste
of tax dollars.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.625
There's no way this jury is
gonna find anything different.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.794
The guy did it,
no question.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.829
Yeah. Mason thought that, too.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.698
It's more than a thought, Gibbs.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.001
Hicks is as guilty as they come.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.636
Why are we talking about this?

10:02.670 --> 10:05.806
Yeah. Maybe he's not.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.241
Ducky says
that the killer

10:08.275 --> 10:09.777
was left-handed.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.344
Hicks is right-handed.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.913
Come on.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.181
A million things
could've happened

10:14.214 --> 10:15.749
to make the guy swing lefty.

10:15.783 --> 10:19.252
Victim was bound and kneeling.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.689
Why swing with your off hand?

10:21.722 --> 10:24.191
I don't know. Ask Hicks.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.193
I took another look
at all the evidence.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.662
Everything you had
was circumstantial.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.031
The guy lied to my face
about where he was that night.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.833
And did you get a look
at his priors?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.367
One prior.
Yeah.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.737
Armed robbery.

10:36.770 --> 10:40.808
Look, did we have this
thing gift-wrapped? No.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.043
It was messy as hell,
but it was enough.

10:43.076 --> 10:46.446
Gibbs, I'm telling you,

10:46.479 --> 10:49.983
Hicks is guilty, 100%.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.054
All right. Good to know. Thanks
for keeping me in the loop.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.291
According to the M.E.
in San Diego,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.761
Sloane profiled everyone
in their office.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.295
No.
Yeah.

11:02.329 --> 11:06.433
Apparently, she had a-a big
wooden cabinet full of files,

11:06.466 --> 11:08.401
kept it locked
all the time.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.970
No way, man.
I was just in her office.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.772
There was not one cabinet there.

11:11.805 --> 11:15.743
I don't know-- she's already
started in on you and Bishop.

11:15.776 --> 11:19.813
Okay, so I...
I got a confession to make.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.716
Uh, Sloane was not asking
anything about Bishop.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.785
Uh, I made the whole thing up.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.820
What, to take the heat
off your pedicures?

11:26.854 --> 11:29.156
No, man, just 'cause
it drives Bishop crazy.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.825
She keeps asking me, "Oh,
what did Sloane say about me?"

11:31.859 --> 11:33.827
What do you think I should say,
something about her feet?

11:33.861 --> 11:36.129
Or something else?
(chuckles)
I don't know,

11:36.163 --> 11:39.132
but GPS says the body was found
in this general location.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.268
Well, it looks like the tree.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.004
The sign is there,
but...

11:44.037 --> 11:45.839
something's different.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.241
11 years later,
the bark's grown over it.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.778
Wow. Mother Nature
kicks ass.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.314
McGEE: Huh, looks like
something's under there.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.988
Look at that.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.056
It's Lieutenant
O'Connell's license.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.392
You think it's been
there the whole time?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.895
Well, the only reason we
found it is 'cause the sign

12:07.928 --> 12:09.863
was pushed forward
from the tree.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.332
ABBY: What was the victim's
license doing there?

12:12.365 --> 12:14.501
I mean, and how the
heck did it end up

12:14.534 --> 12:17.204
behind that sign
in the first place?

12:17.237 --> 12:20.908
Sounds like a question
with a very Abby answer to it.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.176
There are no answers
coming to me.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.244
(computer beeps)

12:24.277 --> 12:26.346
There's an answer coming to me.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.215
Blood on the license?

12:28.248 --> 12:31.451
Well, it's degraded,
due to years of exposure,

12:31.484 --> 12:34.187
but all we needed was
one viable sample to confirm.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.457
And, yup, it belonged
to Lieutenant O'Connell.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.093
Bummer for us,
the killer didn't leave any DNA,

12:40.127 --> 12:41.962
and we still don't know
how the heck

12:41.995 --> 12:44.564
the license got behind the sign
in the first place.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.833
The killer.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.437
What?
Uh, the killer put it there.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.572
What do you mean?
Well, I've been
searching ViCAP

12:52.605 --> 12:54.274
with relevant keywords
and parameters,

12:54.307 --> 12:56.209
and I just found a commonality

12:56.243 --> 12:59.312
with four unsolved murders
in the D.C. area.

12:59.346 --> 13:02.382
And those cases
are linked to ours how?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.887
The victim's license
was discovered

13:06.920 --> 13:08.922
hidden at each of
the crime scenes,

13:08.956 --> 13:11.992
and always with
a smear of blood over the face.

13:12.025 --> 13:15.362
So the license
was a calling card.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.865
Whoever murdered
Lieutenant O'Connell

13:17.898 --> 13:19.900
was a serial killer.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.343
FORNELL:
Gabriel Hicks.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.479
I always knew he was
a lying son of a bitch,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.948
but he's worse than
I gave him credit for.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.150
Serial killer
never entered my mind.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.986
VANCE: Well, let's
shake off the hit.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.854
Trial will be over
in a matter of days.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.122
We need to act now,

13:42.155 --> 13:44.024
so let's direct our efforts
and make a plan.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.626
So, we put the O'Connell case
on the back burner

13:46.659 --> 13:50.964
and focus on connecting Hicks
to the other four murders.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.433
That's not the plan
we had in mind, Tobias.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.869
Not the plan?

13:55.903 --> 13:57.604
That's the only plan.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.439
If that lawyer
talks the jury

13:59.472 --> 14:00.974
out of the truth,
Hicks will walk.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.976
We've decided
to take a second look

14:03.010 --> 14:05.478
at the O'Connell case,
with an open mind.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.314
You're kidding me.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.582
We're taking another whack
at Witness X.

14:09.616 --> 14:10.984
The fruit lady?

14:11.018 --> 14:13.320
(chuckles)
Oh, God, please...

14:13.353 --> 14:14.888
tell me I'm being punked.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.957
We know that she was
in the bank parking lot.

14:16.990 --> 14:20.427
She could be key in I.D.'ing or
confirming O'Connell's killer.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.395
Even if you track her down,

14:22.429 --> 14:24.497
you think she's gonna
remember some guy in a van

14:24.531 --> 14:26.599
from 11 years ago?
It's a long shot,

14:26.633 --> 14:28.401
I agree, but the evidence
we have against Hicks

14:28.435 --> 14:29.636
is all circumstantial.

14:29.669 --> 14:33.606
Which is why we have to look
at him for the other murders.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.408
But he was never a suspect
in the other murders,

14:35.442 --> 14:36.910
and Dr. Mallard
believes that the...

14:36.944 --> 14:38.611
Yeah, that the killer's
left-handed. Right.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.447
I got it. Come on.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.982
Gibbs, help me out here.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.416
You want a bottom line?

14:43.450 --> 14:45.585
This lawyer can make
a pretty good case.

14:45.618 --> 14:46.619
Listen to me.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.556
The murders stopped
after Hicks was locked up.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.358
Maybe, or maybe they haven't
been linked with the other ones.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.592
Oh, you're a "maybe"
kind of guy now?

14:52.625 --> 14:53.693
Maybe I am.
Maybe I'm just trying

14:53.726 --> 14:55.262
to figure this out, same as you!

14:55.295 --> 14:57.197
Well, you're talking
like a guy who's...

14:57.230 --> 14:58.698
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
might I remind you

14:58.731 --> 15:00.533
it's this healthy
type of disagreement

15:00.567 --> 15:03.470
that is the beauty of
a joint investigation.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.506
Right.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.541
Well...

15:08.575 --> 15:10.543
while you guys are
going down a rabbit hole,

15:10.577 --> 15:14.982
I'm gonna focus on
getting a slam dunk on Hicks.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.618
We'll keep you in the loop;
you'll do the same.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.420
Yeah, yeah!

15:20.453 --> 15:22.589
SLOANE:
He is...

15:22.622 --> 15:24.257
educated.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.259
He's accustomed
to the use

15:26.293 --> 15:28.028
of a pen.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.462
1894.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.563
Arthur Conan Doyle,

15:30.597 --> 15:32.732
profile of Jack the Ripper.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.634
Yes! You got it

15:34.667 --> 15:36.136
in three characteristics!

15:36.169 --> 15:37.537
You're like
a machine, Ducky.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.639
Yeah, my turn.
What is this?

15:39.672 --> 15:41.741
They're playing
Name That Profile.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.411
I don't know how to interrupt
without getting analyzed.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.378
Hey!

15:45.412 --> 15:46.746
We're standing here.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.615
Uh, yeah.
Yes, you are. Hi.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.650
DUCKY:
I'm sorry, Jethro,

15:50.683 --> 15:52.119
but Jack here is quite a kick.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.054
Yeah, ain't she great?

15:54.087 --> 15:56.189
What do you got?

15:56.223 --> 15:57.524
DUCKY:
Um, I'm building a picture

15:57.557 --> 15:58.691
of our serial killer.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.727
We're looking
for someone with

16:00.760 --> 16:03.563
antisocial personality disorder.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.732
Psychopath.
Indeed.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.601
As to his victims--
well, they're all male

16:08.635 --> 16:11.204
and notably strong,

16:11.238 --> 16:13.740
which suggests he may be
trying to prove something.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.675
McGEE:
What about the money?

16:15.708 --> 16:18.345
Lieutenant O'Connell
was forced to make a withdrawal.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.713
Yes, well, theft is involved
in all five cases,

16:20.747 --> 16:23.083
likely to support
his habit.

16:23.116 --> 16:26.419
Robbery is his work,
but murder is his pleasure.

16:26.453 --> 16:30.157
And what were you doing while
Ducky was doing all the work?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.658
Hmm.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.261
I was collecting stats
on Jessica Shaeffer.

16:34.294 --> 16:34.961
Hmm.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.629
What, you profiled the lawyer?

16:36.663 --> 16:40.033
I found an in and
made a new friend.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.069
By faking more car trouble?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.736
Actually, I bought her lunch.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.806
Her website bio said she'd
moved here from out of state.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.676
I told her how hard
my own move was.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.178
She empathized.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.046
She's actually
a really nice person.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.116
She became
a public defender

16:56.149 --> 16:57.517
because of her uncle.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.120
He was wrongly convicted
and died in prison.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.722
So she truly believes
that Hicks is innocent?

17:02.755 --> 17:04.424
Are we done talking?

17:04.457 --> 17:05.658
Yup.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.329
My new friend invited me down
to meet Hicks during recess.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.664
Actually, Hicks requested it.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.834
He, uh, wants to show us
he has nothing to hi...

17:14.867 --> 17:16.669
Really?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.471
Oh, yeah. I'm
going with you.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.173
Okay.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.175
Oh, great!
My file cabinet.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.810
Thanks so much.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.812
You can just put it anywhere
over there, all right?

17:25.845 --> 17:29.149
Oh, that's a unique
piece of furniture.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.784
Till we meet again, sir.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.820
TORRES: You mean the cabinet
from San Diego?

17:33.853 --> 17:36.289
It's in her office now?
She had it shipped.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.491
ABBY: That doesn't
mean anything, you guys.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.327
I asked Sloane about this.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.529
She said she doesn't profile
people in her spare time.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.531
Okay, and you believe her?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.533
Why wouldn't I?
She's my friend.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.136
(phone ringing)

17:49.169 --> 17:50.069
McGEE:
Guys, I'm telling you,

17:50.103 --> 17:51.538
this is just what Sloane
wants us to think.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.805
She became "friends"

17:52.839 --> 17:55.375
with that lawyer
just to profile her.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.543
Mm-hmm. Well, did Torres
tell you what she said

17:56.576 --> 17:58.145
about me? She said
I'm the type

17:58.178 --> 17:59.846
to have feet
like a werewolf.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.415
I mean, why would she say
that? It's not even true.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.816
I'll take off my shoes
right now and show you.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.853
Um... actually, uh,
Sloane didn't...

18:06.886 --> 18:09.189
Uh, you know what, uh, Bishop,
we should show McGee

18:09.222 --> 18:11.324
what we've been working on.
There's so many files.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.659
BISHOP:
Yeah, these are from

18:12.692 --> 18:13.793
the other four murder cases.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.262
Suspects?

18:15.295 --> 18:16.896
Uh, there are
about 20, at least.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.532
Authorities were never able
to narrow down the list.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.368
BISHOP: Hard evidence
was just as nonexistent

18:21.401 --> 18:22.802
as it was in
the O'Connell case.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.705
Got something.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.841
So, the FBI collected these bags
a few days after the murder.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.877
They were turned over
by bank customers

18:30.910 --> 18:33.413
who bought fruit in them
from our Witness X.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.915
FBI couldn't pull her DNA
or fingerprints?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.917
No, but there were
unknown particles

18:37.950 --> 18:40.553
on the outside
of two of the three bags.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.554
What was it?

18:41.588 --> 18:43.223
The particles were too small

18:43.256 --> 18:44.724
for their mass spectrometer
to analyze.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.259
Should've given them to you.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.427
They did.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.430
And Ye Olde Major Mass Spec

18:50.463 --> 18:52.532
gave me the same bad news
back then.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.434
Ye Olde Major Mass Spec?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.369
Yeah, this was
11 years ago.

18:56.403 --> 18:59.639
He's had many
upgrades since then.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.209
He's like a whole new man.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.476
I'm...

19:03.510 --> 19:04.811
so proud of him.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.514
You retested the particles
and got a hit.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.648
I did.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.551
It's a clear
rust protectant

19:11.584 --> 19:13.620
that's made for farm equipment.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.521
That's pretty specialized.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.189
ABBY: Yeah, there's
only three stores

19:16.223 --> 19:17.624
in the area that carry it.

19:17.657 --> 19:21.361
Two of them were not
in business 11 years ago.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.829
So I just got off the
phone with the third.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.765
It's a paint store
that's been open for 40 years.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.467
So we're thinking
our fruit lady

19:27.500 --> 19:29.336
got her bags from
a paint store?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.670
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.372
I'm on it.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.241
All that paperwork
is killing me.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.276
I'll text you the address!

19:37.677 --> 19:39.379
Thanks so much
for talking to us.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.381
I know you're
in the midst of a trial.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.582
We won't keep you long.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.717
Thank you for coming.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.486
You get to
a point where

19:46.519 --> 19:47.987
having someone want
to hear you out--

19:48.020 --> 19:49.556
it means everything.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.391
Where would you
like him to start?

19:51.424 --> 19:53.726
Actually, I'd like
to hear whatever

19:53.760 --> 19:55.762
Gabriel would
like us to know.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.269
I-I don't know. Um...

20:02.302 --> 20:06.239
I-I guess that I'm not
what people think I am.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.875
And what do people
think you are?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.810
A liar.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.713
They think I lied
about where I was that night.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.382
I got my days mixed up.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.816
I was scared.

20:16.849 --> 20:20.353
The FBI was questioning
me, and I...

20:20.387 --> 20:22.355
And you had a record.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.424
Yeah.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.726
Armed robbery. I was a
stupid kid with a knife

20:26.759 --> 20:28.361
trying to steal
some beers.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.298
I know how
that sounds.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.934
So, Gabriel, why do you think
you were convicted?

20:34.967 --> 20:38.271
For the longest time, the only
thing that made sense in my head

20:38.305 --> 20:40.740
was that I was framed.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.575
After I was convicted,
I-I heard about

20:42.609 --> 20:44.411
Agent Mason getting
a promotion.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.913
I thought that maybe
he had moved the body

20:46.946 --> 20:49.816
closer to where
I was staying, or...

20:49.849 --> 20:51.818
changed the description
of the car

20:51.851 --> 20:53.653
in order to make me look guilty.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.323
What about now?

20:56.356 --> 20:59.659
I trust Jessica
with my life.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.861
She didn't find any
evidence that I was framed.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.731
So... the only
answer left

21:04.764 --> 21:07.667
is that I was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.802
A coincidence.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.871
Some people don't
believe in such things.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.806
(sighs) I wish
they were right.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.709
I'd be on the outside eating
ice cream right about now.

21:16.743 --> 21:20.313
Ah, that's what you'd do
if you were out, eat ice cream?

21:20.347 --> 21:22.682
No, I...

21:22.715 --> 21:24.684
I don't know why
I said that.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.487
When I was a kid,

21:27.520 --> 21:29.589
playing Little League,
we'd lose,

21:29.622 --> 21:32.024
and it felt like
the end of the world.

21:32.058 --> 21:35.762
So my dad, he'd take me
out for ice cream.

21:35.795 --> 21:40.433
He'd order two scoops
of vanilla, and...

21:40.467 --> 21:42.769
the world was right again,
you know?

21:42.802 --> 21:45.004
He died last year.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.774
And they wouldn't let
me out for the funeral.

21:47.807 --> 21:51.744
Jessica and hope.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.947
That's all I got left in here.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.784
Thank you.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.652
So, what do you think?

21:59.686 --> 22:02.455
Well, no analysis
could be conclusive

22:02.489 --> 22:05.091
after 30 minutes, but
I didn't see anything

22:05.124 --> 22:07.760
to suggest psychopathic
tendencies.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.829
And?

22:09.862 --> 22:11.531
And what?

22:11.564 --> 22:13.833
And what about that gut
of yours?

22:13.866 --> 22:15.468
Huh?

22:15.502 --> 22:18.104
Oh, yeah. That's right, cowboy.

22:18.137 --> 22:20.373
Your gut is so famous,

22:20.407 --> 22:22.775
people bow down to it
all the way to California.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.444
(chuckles) Right.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.879
Come on, lay it on me.
Give me some of that gut stuff.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.682
Tiny bit.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.651
MAN: These the bags
you're talking about?

22:31.684 --> 22:32.585
Yes, sir.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.153
Been using the same ones
since the beginning.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.688
Lot of people now,

22:35.722 --> 22:36.956
they carry their stuff out
with their bare hands

22:36.989 --> 22:38.691
'cause of landfills
and whatnot.

22:38.725 --> 22:39.692
Mr. Rydell...

22:39.726 --> 22:41.994
Pop. Everyone calls me Pop.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.763
All right, Pop.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.733
Uh, I know it's a long shot,
but I need to ask you

22:46.766 --> 22:49.636
about someone
from about 11 years ago.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.938
If I don't remember it,
it didn't happen.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.773
That's how sharp my mind is.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.808
All right, well, she, uh...

22:55.842 --> 22:57.176
she used to sell fruit

22:57.209 --> 22:59.045
around that time,
and she might have

22:59.078 --> 23:01.714
put it in bags
like these from your store.

23:01.748 --> 23:04.183
Sure, I know
who you're talking about.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.818
You do?
My employee.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.720
He used to take home
a stack of bags

23:07.754 --> 23:09.622
now and then to his aunt,
who sold fruit.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.190
All right. What's his name?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.659
I'll do you one better.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.961
You can talk to
him yourself. Ray!

23:14.994 --> 23:16.729
Name's Raymond.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.631
Been working for me
since he was a kid.

23:18.665 --> 23:19.732
Ah.

23:19.766 --> 23:20.900
What you need, Pop?

23:20.933 --> 23:21.901
Hey, Raymond.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.570
Special Agent Nick Torres.

23:23.603 --> 23:24.937
NCIS.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.806
I need to talk to you
about your aunt.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.575
My aunt?

23:28.608 --> 23:29.976
The one you used
to bring the bags for.

23:30.009 --> 23:30.943
R-Ray?

23:32.712 --> 23:34.647
(dog barking in distance)

23:41.988 --> 23:43.523
(chuckles)

23:43.556 --> 23:44.557
Okay.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.637
Night night.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.573
Night night.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.775
(siren approaching)

24:15.755 --> 24:18.591
(door closes)

24:18.625 --> 24:19.258
This guy's aunt

24:19.291 --> 24:20.960
is Witness X.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.495
The fruit lady?

24:22.529 --> 24:23.496
Yep.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.164
VANCE:
Does Agent Torres

24:25.197 --> 24:26.866
plan on asking him a question?

24:26.899 --> 24:28.635
Probably.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.938
It's possible his aunt
could I.D. our killer.

24:31.971 --> 24:32.872
Yes.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.206
Don't you think that warrants

24:34.240 --> 24:36.509
you being in the room?
No.

24:36.543 --> 24:39.646
They swung at each other
and connected.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.948
They got a history now.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.750
Torres needs to use that.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.185
I told him
to take a page from Sloane.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.588
Ah, find an in.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.523
TORRES: You got quite
a hook there, man.

24:52.792 --> 24:56.028
Look, man, I don't want
to be here any more than you do.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.964
I got a boss.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.099
He's an old dude, like yours.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.735
He's gonna make me stay here
two hours plus,

25:02.769 --> 25:06.606
minimum, whether
you're talking or not.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.575
Hey, you box, right?

25:08.608 --> 25:10.743
I mean, you have to
with a swing like that.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.613
'Cause this hurt.

25:13.646 --> 25:16.549
(exhales)
Come on, man.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.251
I'm just trying
to pass the time here.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.621
A place over on Maple.

25:21.654 --> 25:22.955
Maple and Third?

25:22.989 --> 25:24.290
Freddie's Gym.

25:24.323 --> 25:28.060
Ah, I went there
a couple times.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.097
You know, Freddie doesn't let
just anybody in there.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.165
You got to be good peoples.

25:33.199 --> 25:37.269
And if Pop has kept you around
since you were a kid, well...

25:37.303 --> 25:40.673
he must think you're all right.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.042
I trust Pop and Freddie.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.811
Yo, Ray,
just talk to me

25:44.844 --> 25:48.781
about your aunt so the both of
us can get the hell out of here.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.719
Okay.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.320
Okay, I cash the checks.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.688
Checks?

25:55.722 --> 25:57.089
You know what
I'm talking about.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.591
My aunt's checks.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.593
One of her customers left...

26:00.627 --> 26:03.095
her some money in his will.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.598
Checks started coming
after she moved away.

26:05.632 --> 26:06.766
Where'd she move to?

26:06.799 --> 26:08.701
Look, I needed
the money, man.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.203
Pops is still paying me
like it's 1950.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.772
I don't care
about the checks, man.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.274
I just need to know
where your aunt is.

26:15.307 --> 26:18.010
I don't know. I thought
she was suing me or something.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.111
She didn't send you?

26:19.145 --> 26:21.748
What's her name?

26:21.781 --> 26:23.683
Mary Smith!

26:23.716 --> 26:26.052
That was Gibbs on the phone.
I need all hands on deck.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.353
Witness X

26:27.386 --> 26:29.121
is Mary Smith.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.389
Oh, could she have
a more common name?

26:30.422 --> 26:33.025
We also know
that she has annuity checks

26:33.059 --> 26:35.061
from Dawson Mutual

26:35.094 --> 26:38.731
coming to the home address
of her nephew, Raymond Smith.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.233
Well, still, she might
as well be Jane Doe.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.035
Okay, guys, less complaining
and more finding her.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.704
Thought you'd all want to know--

26:44.737 --> 26:47.206
Sloane's cabinet?
Definitely locked.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.709
I just helped her move it
to the other side of her office.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.844
Hey, did she say anything about
my feet when you were up there?

26:51.878 --> 26:53.312
Hmm?

26:53.345 --> 26:55.948
Uh, Bishop, Sloane never said
anything about you at all.

26:55.982 --> 26:58.117
Torres made up the whole thing
about the werewolf feet.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.819
What? Why?

26:59.852 --> 27:01.754
Well, because he likes
to drive you crazy.

27:01.788 --> 27:02.722
Rude.

27:02.755 --> 27:03.856
ABBY:
Okay, guys.

27:03.890 --> 27:04.757
I got a middle name.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.426
I found it on one of
the annuity documents.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.229
Mary Elaine Smith.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.864
I'm gonna search DMV.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.966
I've got government programs.
Banks and credit cards.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.201
I'll hop
on the autopsy computer,

27:15.234 --> 27:16.235
check for death certificates.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.870
All right, guys, we can do this.

27:17.904 --> 27:20.039
Let's find a current address.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.308
MAN:
Mr. Hicks, it's your testimony

27:22.341 --> 27:26.045
that on the evening
of August 24, 2006,

27:26.078 --> 27:28.314
you were staying at
the Richardson's hunting cabin

27:28.347 --> 27:30.016
to write?

27:30.049 --> 27:31.918
Yes.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.153
I was young.
I was traveling the country,

27:34.186 --> 27:36.756
writing,
trying to find myself.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.025
The cabin was just one of the
places I stopped along the way.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.728
And the thousand dollars in cash

27:41.761 --> 27:45.464
that you had in your possession
when you were apprehended--

27:45.497 --> 27:48.267
you said you earned that
doing odd jobs?

27:48.300 --> 27:49.902
Yes.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.804
Do you have any of
your employers' names?

27:51.838 --> 27:53.405
Not all of them.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.141
I'd work a day here and there

27:55.174 --> 27:57.176
for anyone that would hire me
along the way.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.712
You mean, along
your writing journey,

27:59.746 --> 28:01.113
while you
weren't producing

28:01.147 --> 28:02.715
any writing?

28:02.749 --> 28:04.784
Objection. Asked and answered.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.819
Sustained.

28:06.853 --> 28:10.790
Mr. Hicks, that money you had--
you didn't earn that, did you?

28:10.823 --> 28:12.992
Yes, I did. I...
No, you stole it.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.861
You stole it
from Lieutenant O'Connell.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.428
It's what was left
of his withdrawal, wasn't it?

28:16.462 --> 28:18.130
Objection. Badgering.
Then you force him

28:18.164 --> 28:19.732
into your van.
Then you bound him.
Objection.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.433
Sustained.
Then you drag him in the forest.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.002
Mr. Gardiner.
Then you listen to him
plead for his life,

28:23.035 --> 28:26.038
and you strike him so hard
that it caves in his head.

28:26.072 --> 28:29.842
Mr. Gardiner, ask a question
or shut it down.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.046
Mr. Hicks,
if what you say is true,

28:34.080 --> 28:35.815
you were simply
in the wrong place

28:35.848 --> 28:37.850
at the wrong time.
Is that correct?

28:37.884 --> 28:38.851
Yes.

28:38.885 --> 28:41.020
Simply in the wrong cabin,

28:41.053 --> 28:43.422
at the wrong time,

28:43.455 --> 28:45.925
with the wrong vehicle,

28:45.958 --> 28:48.127
with the wrong amount of cash.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.097
That would make you

28:51.130 --> 28:53.199
the unluckiest man in the world,
wouldn't it?

28:53.232 --> 28:55.868
Yes.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.204
(phone ringing)

28:58.237 --> 29:00.807
Bishop, tell me something good.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.041
We got Witness X.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.410
You got what? A name?

29:04.443 --> 29:06.278
Mary Elaine Smith.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.980
She is alive and well.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.248
We tracked her current location

29:09.281 --> 29:11.283
through Social Security.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.551
You're on your way
to talk to her?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.954
Gibbs is.
Keep me posted.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.125
My nephew
was cashing the checks?

29:19.158 --> 29:21.160
We'll get you what you're owed.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.562
No, I don't want it.

29:23.595 --> 29:27.834
Poor kid's had about
as many breaks as I have.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.569
I didn't have enough
to take care of him,

29:30.602 --> 29:32.571
so I left.

29:32.604 --> 29:36.843
But that's not why
you're here, is it?

29:36.876 --> 29:41.981
A man named Gabriel Hicks
is being retried for murder.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.951
You know who I'm
talking about?

29:44.984 --> 29:47.419
You want to know
about the man I saw

29:47.453 --> 29:50.256
driving the blue van that day.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.324
That's right.

29:52.358 --> 29:55.895
I had a few oranges left,

29:55.928 --> 30:00.299
and I wanted to get rid of them
so I could get home.

30:00.332 --> 30:05.838
The man in the van
told me he wasn't interested.

30:05.872 --> 30:09.275
I offered a better price.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.912
He told me to walk away

30:12.945 --> 30:15.147
or I'd regret it.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.349
What did he look like?

30:17.383 --> 30:18.617
It was a long time ago,

30:18.650 --> 30:22.054
and I-I wouldn't know him
if I saw him.

30:22.088 --> 30:26.893
But I do know he was black
and in his 40s.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.996
You sure about that?

30:31.964 --> 30:34.533
Why didn't you tell someone?

30:34.566 --> 30:36.468
I did.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.071
I figured he didn't believe me

30:39.105 --> 30:42.942
because I was just some lady
selling fruit on the street.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.877
Who didn't believe you?

30:44.911 --> 30:47.113
That FBI man.

30:47.146 --> 30:50.883
He tracked me down
11 years ago,

30:50.917 --> 30:54.586
and I told him
exactly what I just told you.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.325
FORNELL:
What do you want me to say?

30:59.358 --> 31:01.327
That you knew where she was
11 years ago

31:01.360 --> 31:02.561
and you talked to her.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.897
Yeah, I talked to her.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.232
And you covered it up.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.000
Because she was lying
through her teeth.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.936
She would've created
reasonable doubt

31:09.969 --> 31:11.971
about a guy that
I know was guilty.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.272
You didn't know a damn thing.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.941
I've got a gut, too, Gibbs!

31:14.974 --> 31:16.342
I knew.
You said yourself

31:16.375 --> 31:17.409
there's reasonable doubt.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.278
Guy takes one
lefty swing,

31:19.311 --> 31:21.247
and you want to throw the whole
investigation out the window?

31:21.280 --> 31:24.350
We got an eyewitness
saying it wasn't him!

31:24.383 --> 31:27.019
Mary Smith was threatened.

31:27.053 --> 31:30.656
Hicks got her to say
exactly what he needed her to.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.992
He scared her so bad,
she's still lying for him.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.027
Happens all the time.
Come on, Gibbs.

31:35.061 --> 31:39.198
A witness is so intimidated
that they disappear.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.466
You know I'm right.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.034
I know about afterwards.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.036
I remember that.

31:44.070 --> 31:47.239
Mason wasn't the only one to get
a promotion off of all this.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.710
I was on this case for a year.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.213
I took Lieutenant O'Connell's
mother to dinner every Sunday

31:54.246 --> 31:57.216
because he wasn't there
to do it anymore.

31:57.249 --> 32:01.954
I promised her justice,
and that's what I gave her.

32:01.988 --> 32:05.924
You expose this witness?

32:06.725 --> 32:10.196
It ends me.

32:10.229 --> 32:14.000
My career.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.134
Emily.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.203
God, Emily.

32:17.236 --> 32:21.073
But...

32:21.107 --> 32:23.542
it's bigger than that.

32:23.575 --> 32:27.313
If you expose
Mary Smith,

32:27.346 --> 32:29.748
a murderer walks.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.151
A serial killer.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.020
Hicks goes off on his merry way,

32:34.053 --> 32:37.589
and we can't try him
for this anymore.

32:37.623 --> 32:41.427
You got blinders on, Tobias.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.662
You didn't do the job.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.999
You never acted
as judge and jury?

32:47.033 --> 32:50.702
Convicting him
was not your call to make.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.972
Hypocrite doesn't
look good on you.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.080
Get out.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.648
Gibbs...

33:02.681 --> 33:05.117
Leave.

33:05.151 --> 33:08.087
Tobias, get out.

33:28.107 --> 33:31.043
Okay, uh, send her up, please.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.345
Boss, Jessica Shaeffer's
on her way up now.
What do we know?

33:33.379 --> 33:35.781
Have you talked
to Mary Smith?

33:35.814 --> 33:37.216
What do we know?

33:37.249 --> 33:39.051
Could she describe the killer?

33:39.085 --> 33:41.420
I asked you a question.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.389
What have you
been doing?

33:43.422 --> 33:45.291
Where is the evidence?
Boss, the list
of suspects

33:45.324 --> 33:47.293
in these other four cases,
it's huge, and we can't

33:47.326 --> 33:49.361
connect any of 'em to
Lieutenant O'Connell's murder.

33:49.395 --> 33:52.598
But we can't connect Hicks
to any other cases either.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.300
BISHOP: Hicks may have
been in the area when all

33:54.333 --> 33:57.403
five murders happened, but so
were at least 20 other suspects.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.338
So we got nothing!

33:59.371 --> 34:00.139
Agent Gibbs.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.443
Agent Gibbs,
I need to speak to you.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.781
I thought
I had your cooperation.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.483
You should've
contacted me already.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.252
For what?

34:13.285 --> 34:14.520
You found Witness X.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.259
Says who?

34:20.292 --> 34:23.495
Are you telling me
you didn't find her?

34:23.529 --> 34:26.598
Or should we start talking
Brady violation?

34:28.234 --> 34:30.502
Agent Gibbs,
(scoffs) I don't know

34:30.536 --> 34:32.671
what's going on here,
but this is a man's life

34:32.704 --> 34:34.440
we're talking about.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.609
What did the witness say?

34:39.511 --> 34:42.348
I'm calling you to the stand.

34:42.381 --> 34:44.850
We'll see what you have to say
under oath.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.496
You had no business discussing
this investigation with anyone.

34:57.529 --> 35:00.499
Uh, who-who'd
I tell what?

35:00.532 --> 35:01.867
You know what I'm talking about.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.369
I wish I did.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.370
Damn it, Sloane...

35:04.403 --> 35:06.572
What? What?!

35:06.605 --> 35:08.574
The lawyer. Your new friend.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.776
You're the only one
with a connection to her,

35:10.809 --> 35:14.180
and she knew we found Witness X.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.252
Okay.

35:23.789 --> 35:27.493
I'm gonna lay it
out for you, okay?

35:27.526 --> 35:29.161
There's two choices.

35:30.629 --> 35:34.300
Option one,
you tell me what's going on,

35:34.333 --> 35:36.835
and none of it
ever leaves the room.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.605
Option two,
I find out on my own--

35:39.638 --> 35:42.474
and I will find out--

35:42.508 --> 35:44.643
then I can't make any promises.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.515
So now you know
I didn't open my big mouth,

35:49.548 --> 35:52.851
and you want to talk, but you
don't want me to think I won.

35:52.884 --> 35:55.254
Nobody won.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.863
(exhales)

36:04.896 --> 36:07.566
Just talk.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.469
Lawyer is calling
me to the stand.

36:13.605 --> 36:16.375
If I tell the truth,

36:16.408 --> 36:19.278
a man will lose
everything.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.848
This man...

36:22.881 --> 36:25.384
known him a long time.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.521
Has a daughter.

36:29.555 --> 36:32.891
He's your friend.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.993
Mm.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.463
And if you lie
to protect your friend,

36:37.496 --> 36:40.666
you could be re-sentencing
an innocent man to death.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.301
Yeah.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.503
That is quite
a conundrum, isn't it?

36:44.536 --> 36:46.438
(clears throat)

36:46.472 --> 36:50.376
So, what do you think
about my cabinet?

36:50.409 --> 36:52.811
I think you are trying
to distract me

36:52.844 --> 36:55.547
with a handcrafted piece
of furniture.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.551
Now, why would I do that?

36:59.585 --> 37:01.019
Because...

37:01.052 --> 37:04.556
you don't know the answers
any more than me.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.992
You're right.

37:07.025 --> 37:09.928
It is handmade.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.998
My, um...

37:13.031 --> 37:17.669
my dad made it for my mom
before they were married.

37:17.703 --> 37:21.940
He was this
great craftsman.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.776
But he was so busy
trying to woo her

37:24.810 --> 37:27.979
that he made the bottom drawers
too tight.

37:28.013 --> 37:31.016
It got humid,
and the wood swelled.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.685
And then they quit opening.

37:33.719 --> 37:37.923
He wanted to fix it,
but, uh, my mom said no.

37:37.956 --> 37:40.025
She loved it
just the way it was.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.494
That one act tells you
everything you need to know

37:42.528 --> 37:44.563
about my mom.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.067
Anyway... (sniffles)

37:49.100 --> 37:52.971
the drawers still don't open,
so it's empty.

37:54.506 --> 37:57.809
But I like having it
in my office.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.345
(grunts)

37:59.378 --> 38:01.747
It reminds me that
even extraordinary people

38:01.780 --> 38:03.515
make mistakes.

38:03.549 --> 38:06.452
That's a given.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.654
It's our response to...

38:08.687 --> 38:11.657
those mistakes that defines us.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.795
So...

38:23.869 --> 38:25.871
Lock up when you're done.

38:34.680 --> 38:38.717
Agent Gibbs,
answer the question.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.820
Did you locate
Witness X?

38:41.853 --> 38:43.589
(sighs softly)

38:45.557 --> 38:46.725
Yes. Yesterday.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.427
What's her name?

38:48.460 --> 38:50.729
Mary Elaine Smith.

38:50.762 --> 38:54.600
Was Mary Smith able to describe
the man in the blue van?

38:54.633 --> 38:56.435
Yes.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.637
What was her description?

38:58.670 --> 39:01.407
African-American,

39:01.440 --> 39:02.708
in his 40s.
(gallery murmuring)

39:05.043 --> 39:06.845
JUDGE:
Order.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.014
Order.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.883
Were you inclined to believe
this witness?

39:15.687 --> 39:17.389
Agent Gibbs,

39:17.423 --> 39:19.658
did you believe Mary Smith?

39:21.059 --> 39:22.494
Yes.

39:22.528 --> 39:23.962
Why is that?

39:23.995 --> 39:26.632
Because she gave
the same statement

39:26.665 --> 39:28.467
at the time of the crime.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.535
To whom?

39:32.971 --> 39:36.775
Let me remind you, Agent Gibbs,
you are under oath.

39:36.808 --> 39:40.812
To whom did Mary Smith give
her statement 11 years ago?

39:45.817 --> 39:48.754
FBI Agent Tobias Fornell.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.489
(gallery murmuring)

39:58.129 --> 40:00.098
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll follow me,

40:00.131 --> 40:02.668
Mr. Hicks will be making
a statement in the atrium.

40:02.701 --> 40:03.702
Thank you.

40:13.645 --> 40:16.181
Ah, Tobias.

40:16.214 --> 40:18.850
It was me.

40:18.884 --> 40:22.087
I tipped off the lawyer
about Witness X.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.789
Why?

40:23.822 --> 40:25.824
What the hell for?

40:25.857 --> 40:29.127
Because I knew
you'd do the right thing.

40:31.229 --> 40:35.767
I've been carrying this around
so long...

40:35.801 --> 40:38.804
I didn't know what
the right thing was anymore.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.908
But I knew you would.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.211
HICKS:
To my lawyer,

40:46.244 --> 40:48.046
Jessica Shaeffer.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.215
I can't thank her enough
for believing in me

40:50.248 --> 40:52.050
and seeing justice through
to the end.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.785
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:53.819 --> 40:56.755
Thank you all.
Excuse me.

40:56.788 --> 40:59.224
(reporters clamoring)

40:59.257 --> 41:01.860
Agent Gibbs.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.729
(chuckles)

41:03.762 --> 41:05.664
I don't even know what to say.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.499
You don't have to say anything.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.100
You gonna be okay?

41:09.134 --> 41:11.236
Yeah. Yeah, it's just...

41:13.238 --> 41:15.140
It's overwhelming.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.943
I don't even know what to do
with myself out here anymore.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.778
Start small.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.813
Maybe some ice cream.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.782
(chuckles):
Right.

41:23.815 --> 41:26.618
Two scoops of chocolate,
in honor of my dad.

41:26.652 --> 41:29.788
Vanilla, wasn't it?

41:29.821 --> 41:31.890
You said your dad
ordered vanilla.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.960
(chuckles):
Vanilla. Right.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.228
I guess I'm even more
overwhelmed than I thought.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.830
Eh.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.234
Thank you.

41:43.268 --> 41:45.070
Oh, yeah.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.540
*

41:55.914 --> 41:57.716
It's possible
he really was overwhelmed.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.785
Or he made the
whole thing up.

41:59.818 --> 42:03.088
You lie about ice cream,
it doesn't make you a murderer.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.890
No.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.125
Does make him a liar.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.903
SLOANE:
He knows we're here.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.215
Switch-hitter.

42:32.217 --> 42:34.786
He played us.

42:37.989 --> 42:39.858
Game's not over.
