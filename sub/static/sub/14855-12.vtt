00:10.767 --> 00:12.904
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper.</i>

00:13.395 --> 00:15.623
<i>And this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

00:17.016 --> 00:19.579
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant DA Alberto Garza.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.247
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

00:22.115 --> 00:23.753
Who the hell are you, people?

00:24.100 --> 00:25.787
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

00:26.457 --> 00:28.897
<i>I know all this because I am living
the same day...</i>

00:29.633 --> 00:31.431
<i>...over and over again.</i>

00:31.470 --> 00:34.199
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

00:34.297 --> 00:35.662
<i>Everyday I get another chance.</i>

00:35.687 --> 00:38.069
For every decision,
there's a consequence.

00:38.159 --> 00:40.493
<i>But last time I changed the day,
I made it worse.</i>

00:40.565 --> 00:42.493
I'm not the one that's different,
this morning.

00:42.507 --> 00:45.403
It's you. You're not the same guy
I went to sleep with last night.

00:45.542 --> 00:46.932
<i>Rita doesn't trust me.</i>

00:47.010 --> 00:48.320
<i>She's hiding something.</i>

00:48.519 --> 00:50.127
Maybe we know a few things you don't.

00:50.445 --> 00:52.946
<i>My dad's old partner Nick
might know what it is.</i>

00:52.993 --> 00:54.776
They'll own you, just like they do me,

00:54.802 --> 00:56.627
your girlfriend...
Everybody's got secrets.

00:56.628 --> 00:57.688
Someone found the body.

00:57.714 --> 00:59.208
<i>So I've got to learn Rita's secret...</i>

00:59.234 --> 01:01.371
We're looking for a guy,
name of Billy Foster.

01:01.372 --> 01:04.102
- So you followed her to the motel.
- What was the name of the motel?

01:04.129 --> 01:06.227
<i>... and figure out
how she's connected to all this.</i>

01:17.262 --> 01:18.974
Your girlfriend's got a secret,
that's all.

01:18.975 --> 01:20.612
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:20.613 --> 01:22.350
It's tough keeping tabs
on a girl like that.

01:22.422 --> 01:24.951
He shot Shelten 5 times
and shot your girlfriend another 3.

01:24.952 --> 01:28.023
- What was the name of the motel?
- Everybody's got secrets, kid.

01:45.819 --> 01:47.262
I need your keys and your phone.

01:47.344 --> 01:48.777
What the hell are you talking about?

01:49.699 --> 01:51.079
You're being car-jacked.

01:56.378 --> 01:58.184
- Shelten?
- Chad, it's Hopper.

01:58.315 --> 01:59.396
Hiya, Hopper.

01:59.675 --> 02:00.642
Too bad you left.

02:00.806 --> 02:01.949
You're missing quite a party.

02:01.968 --> 02:04.149
Listen to me.
Do not, under any circumstances,

02:04.150 --> 02:05.966
take Rita anywhere near a motel, today.

02:05.999 --> 02:07.539
<i>- Do you understand me?</i>
- A motel?

02:08.375 --> 02:09.424
What are you implying?

02:09.555 --> 02:12.984
I'm telling you, if you take her
to a motel, you're both gonna die.

02:14.079 --> 02:15.295
- Is that a threat?
- <i>No.</i>

02:15.296 --> 02:17.089
I'm trying to save Rita's life.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.352
He said that he was being framed

02:20.671 --> 02:23.136
- and that I was in danger.
- Of course he did.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.728
You said he mentioned the name Garza?

02:25.792 --> 02:27.232
Rita? Are you okay?

02:29.477 --> 02:31.953
Shouldn't you be out canvasing
the neighborhood or something?

02:31.969 --> 02:33.953
Yeah, I think we got that covered,
thanks.

02:34.130 --> 02:36.795
I will ask you to come down
to the station, make a formal statement.

02:38.542 --> 02:39.512
I'll take her.

02:42.553 --> 02:43.522
Suit yourself.

02:45.712 --> 02:47.036
Chad, you don't have to.

02:47.206 --> 02:50.011
I'm sorry I even called you
this morning. Just something felt wrong.

02:50.012 --> 02:51.505
No, don't be sorry.

02:51.556 --> 02:53.406
What you were feeling
this morning is intuition.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.625
You were right to call me.

02:54.909 --> 02:56.512
Everything's gonna be OK, today.

02:57.180 --> 02:58.150
I promise.

03:21.608 --> 03:23.534
What the hell are you doing here, D.?

03:24.545 --> 03:25.638
How do you know Nick?

03:25.944 --> 03:27.630
The man reached out when you didn't.

03:27.915 --> 03:28.995
What are you talking about?

03:29.148 --> 03:32.288
- It's got nothing to do with you.
- I got a call from Nick, last night.

03:32.458 --> 03:33.495
An ex-cop...

03:33.887 --> 03:36.273
Telling me that my ass was about
to get hit at the safehouse.

03:36.705 --> 03:38.198
Now, what I'm wondering is

03:38.461 --> 03:40.131
how come that call didn't come
from the cop

03:40.132 --> 03:42.051
who's supposed to be looking out
for my ass?

03:42.634 --> 03:45.053
How would you know about a hit
on a federal witness, Nick?

03:45.393 --> 03:46.757
I still got friends, kid.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.316
Yeah, you mean friends like Booth?

03:50.618 --> 03:51.712
Let me deal with this.

03:52.105 --> 03:53.266
He's family.

03:59.524 --> 04:00.494
Alright.

04:01.385 --> 04:03.325
I gotta go see some family myself.

04:08.062 --> 04:09.073
What are you doing here?

04:09.136 --> 04:11.080
What can you tell me about Rita Shelten?

04:11.450 --> 04:13.975
- Rita who?
- Don't play games with me, Nick!

04:14.464 --> 04:16.740
I haven't seen you in months!
You come on in here,

04:16.745 --> 04:19.028
throwing these names at me!
What the hell's wrong with you?

04:19.043 --> 04:21.509
Give me some answers or you're gonna get
a bullet in your head.

04:21.541 --> 04:22.615
I wouldn't do that.

04:24.625 --> 04:28.631
Damn! You know, for a big dude,
you're pretty light on your feet, Hippo.

04:29.037 --> 04:30.847
I don't know what's got into you today,
kid.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.297
But your dad meant a lot to me,

04:33.362 --> 04:35.395
so I'm just gonna pretend
this never happened.

04:35.872 --> 04:37.419
I recommend you do the same.

04:37.802 --> 04:38.850
It's time to go.

04:40.744 --> 04:41.809
Nice car you got here.

04:42.317 --> 04:43.313
It's a loaner.

04:47.940 --> 04:49.329
Hope you got AAA.

05:12.281 --> 05:13.842
TRACKING MODE(del vo)

05:35.267 --> 05:36.227
Chad...

05:36.251 --> 05:37.722
You know, I can be in there with you.

05:38.147 --> 05:40.272
In the interrogation room...
if you want me to be.

05:40.723 --> 05:41.689
Thanks.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.333
Calm down.

05:47.817 --> 05:48.831
Is that Hopper?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.261
OK, yes. Slow down.

05:53.299 --> 05:54.748
I know where that is. Okay.

05:55.666 --> 05:57.431
I'll be there as soon as I can.

05:57.722 --> 05:58.687
Who was that?

05:59.762 --> 06:00.727
Billy.

06:01.101 --> 06:02.893
- Let me guess, he needs money.
- No.

06:04.418 --> 06:05.629
He said they found the body.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.652
No, he's lying. He's trying to draw you
into something.

06:10.715 --> 06:11.886
I don't think he is.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.525
Chad, we should go to him.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.475
First, you got to get the statement
over with.

06:15.534 --> 06:17.714
The last thing we need to do
is attract attention.

06:17.838 --> 06:18.975
Then, we'll deal with Billy.

06:19.162 --> 06:20.128
I don't know...

06:20.789 --> 06:21.956
He's really upset.

06:22.003 --> 06:24.121
I was there for you before,
I'm here for you now.

06:24.580 --> 06:25.685
We'll take care of this.

06:25.889 --> 06:26.854
Together.

06:27.134 --> 06:28.100
Come on.

06:59.428 --> 07:00.361
+

07:04.941 --> 07:05.913
Hey, it's me.

07:06.377 --> 07:08.422
I guess you weren't kidding
about that Garza thing.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.341
They dragged Rita in
and grilled her about you.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.404
Is Chad with her?

07:11.405 --> 07:12.846
Sergeant Fast-track? Yeah.

07:13.373 --> 07:14.399
He's not leaving her side.

07:14.523 --> 07:16.508
Good. Listen, I need you to pull
a couple of favors

07:16.509 --> 07:17.666
from your friends at county.

07:17.777 --> 07:19.534
Run Rita's name to their system.

07:20.104 --> 07:23.424
This is when I ask you why
and you give me a really good answer.

07:23.695 --> 07:26.121
She was involved
in an incident back in 02.

07:26.367 --> 07:28.241
A traffic stop that went sideways.

07:28.294 --> 07:30.467
I think that may be linked
to whatever's going on today.

07:30.558 --> 07:33.114
You're saying that Rita
has something to do with the Garza hit?

07:33.115 --> 07:35.408
No, not Garza,
but somebody connected to him.

07:35.531 --> 07:38.313
A county sheriff named Buchalter.
He's the one who pulled her over.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.235
I need to know
what went down, that night.

07:40.295 --> 07:41.853
Okay, I'll see what I can find.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.456
Alright. Call me back at this number.

07:43.612 --> 07:44.740
Watch yourself, partner.

07:44.851 --> 07:45.830
Alright.

07:48.393 --> 07:50.393
tracking mode (del vo)

08:17.522 --> 08:19.404
This isn't the first time
that you've been unsure

08:19.405 --> 08:21.323
about someone's whereabouts,
is it Miss Shelten?

08:21.394 --> 08:23.174
Speaking of... Curtis Foster.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.443
No. Not going there.

08:24.666 --> 08:26.776
You were brought in
for questioning back in 02.

08:26.777 --> 08:28.423
I said we are not going there.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.386
The way you're reacting,

08:29.414 --> 08:30.882
let me think <i>you</i> have something to hide.

08:30.883 --> 08:32.469
You wanna ask her about Hopper, do it.

08:32.491 --> 08:34.250
She's not the one accused, here.

08:35.495 --> 08:37.477
We've got the murder weapon
with Hopper's print.

08:37.743 --> 08:39.947
We've got an eyewitness
who puts him at the scene.

08:40.347 --> 08:43.629
Now, is it possible he snuck out
last night while you were sleeping?

08:44.478 --> 08:45.479
I don't know.

08:49.374 --> 08:51.488
I guess anyone's capable of anything.

09:28.523 --> 09:29.503
We need to talk.

09:29.901 --> 09:31.200
This isn't a good time.

09:31.427 --> 09:33.462
I'm on my way to a rally
to see if you were right

09:33.510 --> 09:35.411
about our dear friend Alberto Garza.

09:36.003 --> 09:37.500
I need five minutes.

09:39.117 --> 09:40.170
You've got two.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.291
I know what you did to Garza.

10:02.192 --> 10:05.485
I don't have that kind of pull, Nick,
you give me too much credit.

10:05.725 --> 10:09.242
You get me too little, if you think
I'm gonna swallow that load of bull.

10:10.926 --> 10:13.220
I found your little toy on my car.

10:13.462 --> 10:14.459
What's that?

10:15.205 --> 10:16.188
Please...

10:16.253 --> 10:17.684
Your tracking device.

10:20.237 --> 10:23.583
You and him planning on shuting me up,
like you did Garza ?

10:23.904 --> 10:25.323
Is that why you're here ?

10:26.138 --> 10:28.256
You're afraid
something's going to happen to you?

10:32.002 --> 10:33.918
I actually came here to do you a favor.

10:34.328 --> 10:35.816
That Damien Ortiz kid.

10:35.932 --> 10:37.480
The one from the safe house.

10:38.468 --> 10:39.675
I can give him to you.

10:42.068 --> 10:43.758
And what would be in it for you?

10:44.178 --> 10:45.305
Peace of mind.

10:47.296 --> 10:48.294
I want to get on my boat

10:48.438 --> 10:51.066
and not look over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

10:51.294 --> 10:52.352
I want out.

10:52.680 --> 10:53.650
Out?

10:54.549 --> 10:55.835
After all this time?

10:57.632 --> 10:59.811
The time in front of me
is what i'm looking at.

11:00.145 --> 11:01.407
I ain't get much left.

11:03.082 --> 11:04.053
What's this?

11:04.530 --> 11:05.920
The thing you asked for.

11:06.353 --> 11:08.532
A place to stash the girl
when you grab her.

11:09.831 --> 11:10.750
It's clean.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.215
Untraceable to us.

11:12.449 --> 11:13.589
The guy will adore.

11:14.435 --> 11:15.810
Whatever you do with her,

11:16.108 --> 11:17.598
I don't want to know about it.

11:41.558 --> 11:42.530
Crap!

11:43.134 --> 11:44.467
- Crap!
- You dropped this.

11:48.390 --> 11:49.360
Margo?

12:05.103 --> 12:06.073
Who is that?

12:06.937 --> 12:07.905
No one.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.251
<i>Hey, this is Rita. Leave the message.</i>

12:11.034 --> 12:13.262
Rita, it's me. You're in danger.

12:13.484 --> 12:16.289
I can't explain it but don't go
anywhere near a motel, today.

12:16.289 --> 12:19.538
I know it sounds strange, but please,
baby, you've got to trust me on this.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.689
No motels...

12:33.064 --> 12:34.028
Hey, Rits.

12:34.607 --> 12:35.616
Thanks for--

12:36.152 --> 12:37.149
What's he doing here?

12:37.230 --> 12:39.301
I saved your ass last time, remember?

12:39.446 --> 12:40.903
I told you to come alone.

12:41.521 --> 12:43.578
- They know everything.
- Who does?

12:49.984 --> 12:50.993
Shelten...

12:52.910 --> 12:53.959
it's been a while.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.403
+

13:01.471 --> 13:03.206
- Hopper?
- Yeah. Did you find anything?

13:03.376 --> 13:04.676
Yeah, I sure did.

13:04.793 --> 13:06.365
October 2002.

13:07.231 --> 13:08.961
T stop in Simi Valley,

13:09.024 --> 13:10.645
the driver was Rita Shelten,

13:10.911 --> 13:12.109
<i>and the report was signed</i>

13:12.167 --> 13:13.709
by deputy Buchalter,

13:13.859 --> 13:15.471
<i>pulling over for a busted tail light.</i>

13:15.511 --> 13:16.901
Ok. And? Keep going.

13:16.902 --> 13:18.416
- That's it.
- That can't be it.

13:18.417 --> 13:20.614
There's something else.
What was in the trunk?

13:20.835 --> 13:22.444
Why did Buchalter draw his gun?

13:22.525 --> 13:24.529
There's no mention of any of that
in the report.

13:26.028 --> 13:27.243
They're covering something up.

13:29.783 --> 13:31.327
Here's something they didn't cover up.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.941
They called Rita in for questioning
a couple of days later.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.392
For what?

13:35.667 --> 13:38.610
Disappearance of a Curtis Foster.
That name ring a bell?

13:38.820 --> 13:39.817
Curtis Fo-- No.

13:40.773 --> 13:42.089
Ho, that's weird.

13:42.454 --> 13:45.089
The file just cuts off,
like it's half of something.

13:45.244 --> 13:47.294
Rita never mentioned any of this to you?

13:47.372 --> 13:48.866
No, she's hiding something from me.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.115
<i>I gotta find her.</i>

13:50.246 --> 13:51.136
What are you gonna do?

13:51.834 --> 13:53.235
Get myself some leverage.

13:55.559 --> 13:58.146
If there was a problem
you should have gone through me.

13:59.281 --> 14:00.264
You know this man?

14:00.748 --> 14:02.846
Time to pay an old debt, Miss Shelten.

14:04.084 --> 14:05.527
That deal was between us.

14:06.270 --> 14:08.825
The deal is done by those
who profit from it.

14:09.368 --> 14:10.862
Not just those who make it.

14:11.455 --> 14:12.968
- I thought you and Billy--
- Just...

14:12.969 --> 14:14.439
... listen to the man, OK?

14:14.809 --> 14:16.455
We do what he says and we can go.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.327
Sit down and shut up, Billy.

14:21.177 --> 14:22.136
You know...

14:23.378 --> 14:25.492
it is one thing to bury a body.

14:26.144 --> 14:28.314
And it's quite an other
to make it disappear.

14:31.701 --> 14:33.085
I don't understand.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.486
Billy, you said somebody found the body.

14:35.886 --> 14:37.848
I don't think Billy was told the truth.

14:38.133 --> 14:39.842
This man didn't need to find the body.

14:40.434 --> 14:41.840
He helped us bury it.

14:44.275 --> 14:45.360
What do you want from us?

14:45.629 --> 14:48.002
There's going to be
a lot of questions about Brett Hopper.

14:48.866 --> 14:50.098
You're going to tell the police

14:50.099 --> 14:52.757
that he left your apartement
in the middle of the night.

14:52.910 --> 14:54.247
You're asking me to lie.

14:54.890 --> 14:56.476
You should be quite good at it.

14:56.633 --> 14:58.522
You've had four years of practice.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.208
You awoke to see him living.

15:01.497 --> 15:03.765
And sometime later you saw him return.

15:06.275 --> 15:07.237
I can't do that.

15:07.359 --> 15:09.716
- Of course you can.
- No, she's saying it's too late.

15:11.158 --> 15:13.059
Rita already gave
her official statement.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.160
You gave a statement?

15:21.127 --> 15:22.819
And whose decision was that?

15:25.619 --> 15:28.011
Why would that old cop set me up
after saving my ass ?

15:28.012 --> 15:31.144
The only reason he saved you
was so he could deliver you to Booth.

15:31.313 --> 15:33.026
See, you're his insurance policy.

15:33.235 --> 15:34.821
- For what?
- His life.

15:35.797 --> 15:38.431
Nick is only after himself, man,
he don't care about nobody else.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.568
You, me, we're just chips in his pocket.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.137
Alright, Hop.

15:43.884 --> 15:46.101
I know you aint drive
all the way here to do me a favor.

15:46.102 --> 15:47.320
Sounds like you've got a plan.

15:47.517 --> 15:49.595
Nick, still thinks
you can trust him, right ?

15:50.289 --> 15:52.048
So then you can get close to him.

15:52.739 --> 15:53.710
How close?

16:21.168 --> 16:22.138
We're even, Hop.

16:41.497 --> 16:44.013
- You're making a big mistake here, kid.
- Where is Rita?

16:45.068 --> 16:46.039
Who is this Rita?

16:46.314 --> 16:47.441
Don't lie to me, Nick.

16:47.939 --> 16:48.908
I'm not lying.

16:49.419 --> 16:50.390
What do they have on her?

16:50.901 --> 16:52.153
What is this big secret?

16:52.523 --> 16:55.072
I swear on my life,
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:55.073 --> 16:58.224
Your life doesn't mean that much to me
so you better swear on someone else.

16:58.758 --> 17:01.651
Look, you wanna take a run at Booth,
that's fine by me. I'm just a...

17:01.652 --> 17:04.195
- conduct of information.
- Yeah, I've got that.

17:04.814 --> 17:07.632
I guess that means you'll give up
anybody to save your own ass, huh?

17:08.065 --> 17:09.035
Damien...

17:09.848 --> 17:10.817
Me.

17:11.578 --> 17:13.209
I did what I had to do.

17:13.340 --> 17:15.969
Or Booth would've hit me
the way he hit Garza.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.954
I gotta say, kid...

17:20.512 --> 17:22.675
I don't know what's shorter: your temper
or your memory,

17:22.675 --> 17:24.634
after everything I did for your father.

17:26.132 --> 17:29.081
Who stepped in and took care
of your family after he killed himself?

17:30.112 --> 17:31.528
Who did your sister call?

17:31.885 --> 17:34.126
Who cleaned up the scene?
Took care of the pension?

17:35.638 --> 17:36.960
Wait...

17:38.344 --> 17:39.309
I'll make a deal.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.272
I get on my boat and disappear.

17:43.681 --> 17:45.065
You'll never hear from me again.

17:45.749 --> 17:46.928
You got that right.

17:47.716 --> 17:48.389
+

17:51.085 --> 17:52.579
- Wait!
- Shut up!

17:53.572 --> 17:54.542
You had your chance.

17:54.753 --> 17:56.075
I swear I didn't know it was her.

17:56.148 --> 17:58.580
You found the place
where they're stashing her!

17:58.581 --> 17:59.780
You found it, I know this!

17:59.832 --> 18:01.478
They were looking
for a place to put her,

18:01.479 --> 18:03.160
- but I didn't know it is Rita...
- Where?

18:03.454 --> 18:04.784
1012 VS Ombra.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.196
But he never said anything
about hurting her.

18:07.815 --> 18:09.113
They're going to kill her.

18:09.276 --> 18:12.094
- Not if she does what they'll ask her.
- I know it.

18:12.893 --> 18:13.863
I've seen it.

18:13.975 --> 18:16.016
I've known you since you were sixteen.

18:16.658 --> 18:17.628
Please!

18:18.624 --> 18:20.833
Think of your dad, what would he say?

18:39.413 --> 18:41.483
- Andrea.
- Hopper, I was gonna call you.

18:41.627 --> 18:44.747
Okay. Rita is in danger,
she's at 1012 VS Ombra.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.098
How soon can you meet me?

18:49.140 --> 18:50.111
They found her.

18:50.465 --> 18:51.813
What? What're you talking about?

18:52.928 --> 18:53.898
They found Rita.

18:55.265 --> 18:56.234
But too late.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.541
<i>She was with Chad.</i>

18:59.681 --> 19:00.651
They are...

19:02.885 --> 19:03.894
They're both gone.

19:05.048 --> 19:06.771
No, it can't... No... That's...

19:07.326 --> 19:08.546
I told Chad not to go.

19:09.590 --> 19:10.586
<i>Where were they?</i>

19:13.820 --> 19:15.412
Tell me where they were!

19:16.408 --> 19:18.800
<i>They said they found them
into some motel.</i>

19:19.980 --> 19:20.950
It's all I know.

19:22.837 --> 19:24.357
<i>They're at the coroner's office.</i>

20:21.876 --> 20:22.886
We have to go.

20:36.782 --> 20:38.177
DAY 2 (del vo)

20:51.033 --> 20:52.003
What's wrong?

20:52.566 --> 20:55.056
Nothing,
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

20:56.522 --> 20:57.491
I'm fine.

21:00.284 --> 21:01.883
I have to get ready for work.

21:11.273 --> 21:13.738
I was thinking
maybe we could take the day off, today.

21:14.615 --> 21:15.717
I don't think I can do that.

21:16.961 --> 21:18.521
We could drive up the coast.

21:18.797 --> 21:20.684
You've always said you wanted to.

21:22.252 --> 21:24.034
When did I say I wanted to do that?

21:25.685 --> 21:26.760
What are you doing?

21:27.678 --> 21:29.173
I was... My battery...

21:29.497 --> 21:31.630
ran out so I was just
switching mine out with yours.

21:31.683 --> 21:33.990
I charged that last night,
I'm gonna need that today.

21:34.796 --> 21:37.482
I got some important phone calls
to make, so can I borrow your phone?

21:37.522 --> 21:38.741
Well, just hurry up, then.

21:38.806 --> 21:39.934
I have to get going.

21:43.059 --> 21:44.056
Baby!

21:47.543 --> 21:48.538
You...

21:49.109 --> 21:50.603
want me to drive you work this morning?

21:50.663 --> 21:51.933
I thought it's out of your way.

21:52.176 --> 21:55.099
I figured we'll spend a little time
with each other, get a little breakfast.

21:57.197 --> 21:59.188
Why are you being so curly with me,
this morning?

22:00.604 --> 22:01.575
What was that?

22:09.049 --> 22:11.435
Brett, I don't really have time
to do this.

22:11.514 --> 22:12.628
Be easy! I just...

22:13.107 --> 22:15.169
Wanna spend some time with you.
Talk.

22:20.969 --> 22:23.079
- Is that my phone?
- Yeah, we must-- I got it.

22:23.538 --> 22:24.508
I got it. Hello?

22:25.648 --> 22:26.618
Who is this?

22:27.667 --> 22:29.134
I got it. Who is this?

22:33.500 --> 22:36.160
Billy, slow down,
you're not making any sense.

22:36.844 --> 22:38.497
I'm gonna call you right back.

22:39.834 --> 22:41.432
Everything OK? Who's Billy?

22:41.930 --> 22:44.591
It's no one, it's somebody from work,
it's nothing.

22:44.670 --> 22:45.640
Work?

22:46.423 --> 22:47.387
Who is it?

22:47.915 --> 22:49.528
- It was just work.
- She's not here now.

22:49.528 --> 22:51.218
She's not here? Her shift started at 8.

22:51.219 --> 22:53.420
She called in,
said she was taking a vacation day.

22:54.391 --> 22:56.258
You're keeping something from me.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.744
- I gotta go.
- Wait! I'm sorry, wait!

22:59.757 --> 23:00.655
I don't have time, OK?

23:00.656 --> 23:03.109
I just wanna know who Billy was
and what that call was about.

23:03.110 --> 23:05.110
- None of your business!
- See, this is my business.

23:05.111 --> 23:06.884
- Let go of me, Brett!
- I can't do that.

23:06.937 --> 23:07.920
I'm serious!

23:07.921 --> 23:09.532
If I let go of you, you will die.

23:09.584 --> 23:10.554
Let her go, sir.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.017
It's alright, man. LAPD. We...

23:13.018 --> 23:14.958
Then you should know
not to grab a lady like that.

23:14.959 --> 23:17.128
Don't touch me. Wait, Rita!
- Why don't we just

23:17.158 --> 23:18.652
- take it easy?
- Let me handle this!

23:18.796 --> 23:20.670
- Calm down!
- Don't tell me to calm down!

23:23.674 --> 23:24.999
Get your hands on the counter!

23:26.833 --> 23:28.485
Hopper just got pinched.

23:29.379 --> 23:30.349
Yeah, got it.

23:32.223 --> 23:34.517
- Now what?
- Get into position and we wait.

23:37.270 --> 23:40.113
Just so you know, that girl is a witness
in a homicide case.

23:40.114 --> 23:42.132
It she gets away,
she's gonna be in serious danger.

23:42.133 --> 23:44.046
Now do you want that on your head?

23:52.952 --> 23:53.909
I need your phone.

23:59.366 --> 24:00.552
Rita, it's me.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.685
Billy, it's me. Where are you?

24:14.335 --> 24:16.748
- Where?
- 1012 VS Ombra.

24:38.290 --> 24:39.195
Margo.

24:39.847 --> 24:40.242
+

24:42.833 --> 24:44.151
It's alright.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.537
I'm here to help you.

24:45.717 --> 24:46.698
Alright?

24:47.245 --> 24:48.443
- Oh my God!
- It'll be OK.

24:48.483 --> 24:50.446
Alright, now can you tell me
what happened here?

24:51.509 --> 24:53.068
- Oh my God!
- Okay, look at me.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.183
Margo...

24:54.201 --> 24:55.183
Look at me, breathe.

24:55.525 --> 24:56.552
Slow it down.

24:57.353 --> 24:58.347
I got you.

24:58.469 --> 24:59.298
It's OK.

24:59.919 --> 25:00.883
Alright, there we go.

25:02.845 --> 25:04.028
Alright, now tell me.

25:05.142 --> 25:06.143
Where is Rita?

25:06.761 --> 25:07.832
Who is Rita?

25:10.452 --> 25:11.601
How do you know my name?

25:11.852 --> 25:13.167
That's a long story but...

25:13.311 --> 25:15.267
I'm a cop.
My name is Detective Brett Hopper.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.773
Yeah, that's what they said.

25:17.018 --> 25:18.368
They grabbed me at work.

25:18.612 --> 25:19.578
Two of them!

25:19.658 --> 25:21.953
They said they were cops
and they had badges just like that.

25:21.972 --> 25:23.335
What did these men want?

25:24.241 --> 25:26.007
They wanted...

25:26.187 --> 25:28.143
They wanted me to set up a meeting.

25:28.261 --> 25:29.991
At the courthouse, tomorrow morning.

25:30.968 --> 25:32.652
They gave me names to call over...

25:32.951 --> 25:34.355
Six, I don't...

25:34.707 --> 25:36.995
Maybe seven other judges.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.099
Judges?

25:38.922 --> 25:40.274
Yeah, a clerk for one.

25:41.445 --> 25:42.430
Nitzberg.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.058
And this judge, Nitzberg...

25:45.572 --> 25:46.959
He's your supervisor.

25:51.151 --> 25:53.340
Why would these men kidnap you
just to set up a meeting?

25:53.375 --> 25:54.333
I don't know.

25:54.540 --> 25:56.468
Something to do
with the grand jury investigation

25:56.486 --> 25:57.977
- he's working on.
- What's it about?

25:58.495 --> 25:59.919
Corruption at city hall.

26:00.836 --> 26:02.178
It's all laid down in a...

26:02.449 --> 26:03.710
In a sealed warrant.

26:04.815 --> 26:06.728
Alright, I don't understand,
I need to see it.

26:07.672 --> 26:09.425
Can you get me a copy of this warrant?

26:09.426 --> 26:11.483
It's locked up in Nitzberg's chamber.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.895
Alright, listen to me,
I'm gonna call 911,

26:13.961 --> 26:15.321
they're gonna send a patrol car,

26:15.348 --> 26:16.797
you're gonna be safe there, OK?

26:17.036 --> 26:18.003
Alright?

26:18.246 --> 26:19.278
Margo, look at me.

26:19.728 --> 26:20.844
I need that warrant.

26:22.632 --> 26:24.189
There's someone else I need to find.

26:24.243 --> 26:26.179
You're gonna be OK.

26:33.303 --> 26:35.365
Andrea, I need you to do some for me,
go to Chad,

26:35.473 --> 26:36.536
and sell me out.

26:39.184 --> 26:40.720
You did the right thing, Battle.

26:40.987 --> 26:43.074
I'll make sure
your lieutenant knows about it.

26:43.131 --> 26:44.390
Gee, thanks.

26:44.489 --> 26:46.101
What's happening?
Don't do that.

26:46.895 --> 26:47.860
Give it up.

26:48.048 --> 26:49.741
Over here, nice and slow.

26:53.938 --> 26:55.366
Thanks, partner, I got it from here.

26:55.704 --> 26:56.690
My pleasure.

26:58.010 --> 26:59.000
Hey Battle!

27:00.116 --> 27:02.268
I'll make sure to tell your lieutenant
about this, too.

27:02.269 --> 27:03.265
Don't blame her.

27:05.601 --> 27:07.252
This was the only way
I could talk to you.

27:07.253 --> 27:08.644
Plenty of time to talk in prison.

27:08.777 --> 27:10.860
- I'll bring you a fruit cake.
- Shut up and listen.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.676
Do you know where Rita is?

27:13.119 --> 27:14.749
It's funny you are asking me.

27:15.235 --> 27:17.432
- Why don't you call her?
- She won't take my calls.

27:18.099 --> 27:19.712
Yeah, she does have a temper.

27:20.318 --> 27:21.468
Although, the making-up part,

27:21.496 --> 27:22.995
- that--
- She's gonna die, Chad.

27:23.307 --> 27:25.157
You're threatening her?
'Cause I'll take you...

27:25.941 --> 27:27.232
I'm trying to save her.

27:27.814 --> 27:28.787
Now, I need your help.

27:31.343 --> 27:33.239
I don't know what game
your're playing, Hopper...

27:33.240 --> 27:34.139
I'm not playing.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.841
Look, I know she's been keeping
a secret from me.

27:37.986 --> 27:40.712
A run that she had with a cop
named Buchalter back in 02.

27:40.850 --> 27:42.007
I also know she was questioned

27:42.060 --> 27:44.046
about the disappearance
of a man the same year.

27:44.172 --> 27:46.294
Now, today, she gets a call
from some guy named Billy.

27:47.193 --> 27:48.163
Some guy?

27:49.665 --> 27:50.879
She didn't tell you about Billy?

27:52.866 --> 27:53.865
This is too good.

27:54.729 --> 27:55.943
You really don't know.

27:58.844 --> 27:59.947
Billy's her brother.

28:02.087 --> 28:03.834
I guess you two have grown real tight.

28:04.223 --> 28:06.097
At least, I knew who was in her family.

28:06.196 --> 28:08.545
Well, whoever he is,
she is on her way to see him now.

28:08.654 --> 28:09.923
And if I don't find out where...

28:10.085 --> 28:11.051
she's gonna die.

28:11.628 --> 28:12.587
So...

28:13.518 --> 28:14.505
Just call her.

28:16.363 --> 28:17.849
Sorry, pal, can't help you.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.294
Call her.

28:32.764 --> 28:33.800
Rita, it's Chad.

28:33.872 --> 28:35.249
Chad, I was just gonna call you.

28:35.267 --> 28:36.771
<i>It's been an awful day.</i>

28:36.834 --> 28:38.274
<i>Brett is acting really weird,</i>

28:38.572 --> 28:39.600
and Billy called.

28:40.474 --> 28:41.365
<i>He said...</i>

28:41.770 --> 28:43.085
He said they found the body.

28:43.836 --> 28:44.822
Where are you?

28:44.823 --> 28:46.841
I'm at the Glen Capri motel in Glendo.

28:46.995 --> 28:48.697
You stay there, you don't go in, ok?

28:48.787 --> 28:49.762
You wait for me.

28:51.912 --> 28:52.885
Hey, sis.

29:01.026 --> 29:03.213
Come on, what do you know
that you're not telling me?

29:03.509 --> 29:04.471
It's not my place.

29:04.499 --> 29:05.921
Come on, guy, she is my girlfriend.

29:06.020 --> 29:07.271
She was my wife.

29:08.057 --> 29:10.613
We went through a lot together,
if she wants to tell you, she can.

29:10.645 --> 29:12.182
What can you tell me about her brother?

29:12.854 --> 29:14.051
- Billy?
- Yeah.

29:14.618 --> 29:15.831
Billy's got the word loser,

29:15.857 --> 29:18.781
I bet it is in his DNA, he's like
a genetically engineered screw-up.

29:20.643 --> 29:22.110
What didn't she tell me about him?

29:23.709 --> 29:26.405
Maybe she didn't want you
to think the less of her.

29:26.744 --> 29:27.711
So she lied.

29:28.897 --> 29:32.138
Sometimes, a lie is the only way
to protect someone you care about.

29:35.117 --> 29:36.616
I won't lie to the police.

29:37.158 --> 29:39.445
Of course you can,
you've been doing it for four years.

29:39.652 --> 29:42.111
Look...
this comes out, we both go to jail.

29:42.768 --> 29:44.365
For me, that's three strikes.

29:45.406 --> 29:48.803
So, I-- Brett was acting
so strange at the diner.

29:49.398 --> 29:50.390
He knew.

29:51.919 --> 29:53.432
He was protecting me.

29:54.154 --> 29:55.432
What do you meam, "he knew"?

29:56.216 --> 29:57.632
I don't know who you are.

29:58.468 --> 29:59.827
But I don't want any part of this.

30:01.512 --> 30:02.474
I'm out of here.

30:03.123 --> 30:04.122
Rita, wait!

30:04.339 --> 30:06.950
I would rethink my decision,
Miss Shelten.

30:07.274 --> 30:08.237
Please.

30:08.399 --> 30:10.588
I have been protecting you
your whole life, Billy.

30:10.610 --> 30:12.814
- Don't leave me.
- Every arrest, every screw-up.

30:15.124 --> 30:16.250
But I won't do this.

30:25.774 --> 30:26.819
Let me talk to her.

30:27.873 --> 30:28.944
I can convince her.

30:29.187 --> 30:30.863
You know, I highly doubt that.

30:31.565 --> 30:34.196
But then I always did think
it was a long shot.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.622
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't go well.

30:37.623 --> 30:38.800
She's headed your way.

30:38.855 --> 30:40.362
How do you want it to go down?

30:40.547 --> 30:41.526
Make it public:

30:41.755 --> 30:42.742
car-jacking.

30:42.826 --> 30:45.457
Corner of Region and Queen,
get her face on tape.

30:45.846 --> 30:46.829
Understood.

30:47.827 --> 30:49.321
What do you mean, car-jacking?

30:49.394 --> 30:50.561
You're not gonna hurt her?

30:53.007 --> 30:54.052
For every decision,

30:55.565 --> 30:56.927
there's a consequence.

30:57.007 --> 30:58.646
Look, let's talk about this.

30:58.971 --> 30:59.962
Decision...

31:05.188 --> 31:06.206
Consequence.

31:06.835 --> 31:07.808
Bitch.

31:08.710 --> 31:10.114
Billy, where is she?

31:10.753 --> 31:11.721
Where is she?

31:19.960 --> 31:21.176
What are you, crazy?

31:34.924 --> 31:35.595
+

32:17.873 --> 32:19.071
You OK? Come on.

32:21.793 --> 32:22.783
Thanks.

32:23.170 --> 32:24.728
No, I owed you one.

32:25.097 --> 32:26.891
Those men just tried to kill us.

32:27.798 --> 32:29.420
- Oh my God, Billy!
- He's fine.

32:29.528 --> 32:30.878
We told him to leave town.

32:31.696 --> 32:33.008
Where do you think you're going?

32:33.163 --> 32:34.226
We gotta move, man.

32:34.568 --> 32:37.054
We gotta stay here and explain all this
when back-up gets here.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.066
Well, good luck with that.
Get in the car.

32:39.399 --> 32:41.076
I can't let you leave Hopper.

32:41.172 --> 32:42.487
Chad, what are you doing?

32:42.676 --> 32:43.999
He just saved your life.

32:44.099 --> 32:45.394
He's also a wanted fugitive.

32:45.962 --> 32:47.404
What the hell is wrong with you?

32:47.459 --> 32:50.116
He's innocent, it'll all sort itself out
down at the station.

32:50.233 --> 32:51.458
- If not...
- If not?

32:55.924 --> 32:57.230
What do you want to do?

33:02.141 --> 33:03.168
I'm sorry, Chad.

33:03.635 --> 33:04.603
We're leaving.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.541
You're not gonna to stop us.

33:09.821 --> 33:10.818
Let's go.

33:31.066 --> 33:33.681
It should just take him two hours
before he finds and knows.

33:35.636 --> 33:36.602
You okay?

33:37.356 --> 33:38.826
I should have trusted you.

33:40.029 --> 33:42.201
I should have told you a long time ago.

33:44.243 --> 33:45.221
Told me...?

33:45.396 --> 33:46.415
About my dad.

33:47.453 --> 33:49.485
About how Chad and I
got caught up in all of this.

33:52.702 --> 33:53.663
My dad was...

33:55.367 --> 33:56.359
He drank.

33:57.408 --> 33:58.385
And when he got mean...

33:59.112 --> 34:00.318
He took it out on Billy.

34:00.714 --> 34:01.682
And Billy...

34:02.425 --> 34:03.389
fought back.

34:06.475 --> 34:07.456
I did.

34:09.266 --> 34:10.337
Billy called me,

34:10.946 --> 34:11.918
scared.

34:13.282 --> 34:14.748
When I got to the house...

34:15.697 --> 34:17.812
my dad had almost beaten him to death.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.837
I swear, he was gonna finish him off.

34:23.020 --> 34:24.174
So I saw...

34:25.733 --> 34:27.308
this big flashlight...

34:31.172 --> 34:33.103
I didn't think I hit him that hard...

34:37.009 --> 34:38.617
You were protecting your brother.

34:38.693 --> 34:41.496
But we were so sure
that we were gonna go to jail.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.947
He already had a record so...

34:45.386 --> 34:47.628
we decided to get rid of the body
ourselves.

34:47.896 --> 34:49.362
That's when Buchalter pulled you over.

34:49.364 --> 34:50.835
Yeah, I freaked out.

34:52.167 --> 34:54.873
So I did the only thing
I could think of, I called Chad.

34:55.168 --> 34:56.293
And he showed up...

34:56.792 --> 34:58.658
And he talked to the cop and he...

35:00.202 --> 35:01.289
He took care of it.

35:04.930 --> 35:07.236
And I know how you feel
about your father.

35:08.551 --> 35:10.597
Being a cop
and dying in the line of duty.

35:13.334 --> 35:15.541
How could I tell you what I did to mine?

35:19.017 --> 35:20.025
Rita, I...

35:22.152 --> 35:23.123
My father...

35:26.853 --> 35:27.814
I lied.

35:30.042 --> 35:31.038
My father...

35:31.519 --> 35:32.369
killed himself.

35:33.471 --> 35:35.175
The line of duty things was just to...

35:36.985 --> 35:37.983
To cover up.

35:49.020 --> 35:49.994
I'm sorry.

35:55.272 --> 35:56.686
What are we gonna do?

35:58.991 --> 36:00.917
We can't just run from all of this.

36:04.423 --> 36:06.171
You said Chad made it go away, right?

36:06.386 --> 36:07.440
How did he do that?

36:07.778 --> 36:09.299
Weren't you questioned by the police?

36:09.373 --> 36:11.879
The people he delt with,
they arraigned some lawyer,

36:11.880 --> 36:13.222
some big shot attorney.

36:14.123 --> 36:16.432
He came with me for the questioning,
and he just...

36:16.833 --> 36:18.285
He just made it all go away.

36:18.325 --> 36:19.726
A defense attorney.

36:20.563 --> 36:21.992
You remember what his name is?

36:22.392 --> 36:23.375
Sure.

36:23.454 --> 36:24.987
His name is Barry Coldburn.

36:25.464 --> 36:28.589
<i>I got you one of the best attorneys
in the state, Barry Coldburn.</i>

36:28.590 --> 36:30.731
You are now protected
under attorney-client privilege.

36:30.742 --> 36:31.697
Take a plea.

36:31.697 --> 36:33.400
I can probably get you murder II.

36:48.417 --> 36:49.697
I have to say, Tobey...

36:50.822 --> 36:53.415
When you screw up,
you swing for the fences.

36:53.831 --> 36:56.872
I can assure you
tomorrow will go just as planned.

36:57.766 --> 36:59.045
How are you gonna pull that off?

36:59.450 --> 37:02.466
Your two sheriffs, Fencik and Buchalter,
got hit today.

37:03.325 --> 37:04.847
I can find replacements.

37:05.477 --> 37:07.592
Do you realize what this could cost us,

37:07.592 --> 37:10.285
all these messes
I keep having to clean up?

37:10.766 --> 37:12.139
It's all under control.

37:13.121 --> 37:15.319
This all started
when you couldn' t keep it in your pants

37:15.320 --> 37:16.579
for that mexican girl.

37:16.824 --> 37:19.795
And now, I'm trying to keep
the whole system from imploding.

37:19.796 --> 37:21.322
By tomorrow, you'll be back in control

37:21.323 --> 37:23.508
and we'll be moving on
to bigger and better things.

37:23.509 --> 37:25.773
Really? Detweiler is dead.

37:26.230 --> 37:27.940
And who knows how much Hopper's learned.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.119
Not enough to hurt us.

37:29.229 --> 37:30.216
Not yet.

37:30.319 --> 37:32.623
It's hard enough paining Garza
on Hopper.

37:33.047 --> 37:34.411
Now even that may not stick.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.744
I'll make sure it sticks.

37:37.214 --> 37:38.177
How?

37:39.871 --> 37:41.510
We still have our inside man.

37:51.532 --> 37:52.733
So, is that the sealed warrant?

37:52.947 --> 37:54.128
No, I couldn't get it.

37:54.226 --> 37:56.154
It's locked in judge Nitzberg's safe.

37:58.355 --> 37:59.233
What's this?

37:59.234 --> 38:00.807
I did get you this subpoena list though.

38:01.364 --> 38:03.294
Okay, I got it.

38:04.025 --> 38:05.349
Booth, Detweiler,

38:05.558 --> 38:06.953
Damien, Garza.

38:07.781 --> 38:09.183
Are these all tied to the same case?

38:10.323 --> 38:12.352
I don't understand.
Why was Garza subpoenaed?

38:12.588 --> 38:13.565
He cut a deal.

38:14.168 --> 38:16.024
He's supposed to testify against Booth.

38:17.583 --> 38:19.087
Garza was dirty too.

38:21.959 --> 38:22.942
Spivak?

38:23.040 --> 38:24.137
You know who he is?

38:27.458 --> 38:28.508
Detective Brett Hopper?

38:28.621 --> 38:30.327
We've got the gun,
with your prints on it.

38:30.328 --> 38:32.618
I think you killed Garza...
... hit Shelten five times.

38:32.750 --> 38:33.768
She was quite a looker.

38:33.769 --> 38:35.756
Brett Hopper?
You're under arrest for the murder...

38:35.757 --> 38:38.567
Brett Hopper you're under arrest for the
murder of Alberto Garza.

38:38.568 --> 38:40.135
... assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

38:40.142 --> 38:41.876
The guy's running after me since Day 1.
