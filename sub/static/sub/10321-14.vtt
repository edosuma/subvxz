You know the kind of guy
who does nothing
but bad things...

00:03.804 --> 00:06.707
and then wonders why
his life sucks?

00:06.740 --> 00:11.145
Well, that was me.
Every time somethin' good
happened to me,

00:11.179 --> 00:13.281
somethin' bad
was always waitin'
around the corner.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.085
Karma.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.220
That's when I realized
I had to change.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.391
So I made a list
of everything bad
I've ever done,

00:23.424 --> 00:26.394
and, one by one,
I'm gonna make up
for all my mistakes.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.362
I'm just tryin'
to be a better person.

Ever since I made my list...

00:33.701 --> 00:35.703
and got us
out of the stealin' business,

00:35.736 --> 00:37.538
Randy doesn't have
an income anymore.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.441
Can I have more money
for the claw machine?

00:40.474 --> 00:43.177
You're the one who told me
to go after Kermit.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.746
He's got those skinny legs.
He's not a cheap Muppet
to claw.

Hey, dummy.
One of your little
butt buddies,

00:51.752 --> 00:54.288

made it in the newspaper.

00:54.322 --> 00:57.325
Jackass tried to rob
a liquor store with a crossbow.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.630
"Jackass tries to rob a liquor
store with a crossbow."

01:02.663 --> 01:06.134
Wow, I didn't think you could
say "jackass" in the newspaper.
World's changin', Earl.

You'd be surprised what
those asswipes in the media
get away with.

the douche bag on the bottom.
Shot himself in the arm.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.208
Ow, that's gotta hurt.

01:14.242 --> 01:18.179
Twenty years?
They're sendin' him
to state prison for 20 years.

01:18.212 --> 01:21.749
Long stretch. But at least
he'll be able to spend some
quality time with his daddy.

[ Earl Narrating ]
As bad as I felt for Hank,
I had my own problem.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.854
Hank was on my list.

01:26.887 --> 01:30.624
Number 18--
told an inappropriate story
at Hank Lange's birthday party.

01:30.658 --> 01:33.861
So I said, "Well,
if you have to tinkle,
just do it in the ocean."

01:33.894 --> 01:38.632
He walked to the edge of the
water, dropped his tiny trunks
and whizzed into the ocean.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.702
- [ All Laugh ]
- I got a story about Hank.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.772
It was Steve Coco's
bachelor party.

01:44.805 --> 01:49.643
And like all bachelor parties,
there was some entertainment.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.546
- Uh, Earl, maybe-- maybe
this isn't the best time.
- No, no, no.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.848
Come on. Don't worry,
I won't tell the bad part.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.618
So Hank goes into the bathroom
with this stripper,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.853
and then, uh, you know,
some stuff happens.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.523
Anyway,
Hank comes out...

02:02.556 --> 02:06.327
about 10 minutes later
with his tongue down
this stripper's throat,

02:06.360 --> 02:09.330
tellin' her how she's gonna
be his wife, and then,

02:09.363 --> 02:11.865
all of a sudden,
somebody said to Hank,

02:11.899 --> 02:17.405
"I think she'd make a better
husband 'cause she's a dude!"

- I gotta do it by Friday.
- Can I have
another quarter?

02:35.623 --> 02:39.193
I only got one,
and I wanna listen to Skynyrd

- Can I have a quarter?
- I know your beggin' ass did
not just ask me for a quarter.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.600
Hey, Darnell, do you have
a quarter I can borrow?
I think so.

02:46.634 --> 02:50.738
Yeah, he's got a quarter.
You know why he's got a quarter?
He's got a damn job. That's why.

02:50.771 --> 02:55.343
I don't have a quarter.
Just three nickels and
a super-sour gummy worm. Sorry.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.712
When is your lazy ass gonna
stop mooching off your brother
and get a job?

02:58.746 --> 03:03.484
You're damn near 30 years old.
You need to start acting like
an adult like the rest of us.

03:03.517 --> 03:07.588
Darnell, don't you go off with
my gummy worm! You took it out
of my trick-or-treatin' bucket!

03:07.621 --> 03:11.659
One time me and Hank polished
off four bottles of Cherry
Mad Dog and swore that...

03:11.692 --> 03:15.729
if one of us ever got put away
for hard time, the other one
would break him out.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.466
I hope he doesn't
remember that, Randy.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.634
- Should I get a job?
- What?

03:20.668 --> 03:24.405
Joy said I should get a job
so you don't have to
support me anymore.

A purpose is a great thing
to have.

With the doughnuts in hand,
all I had to do was...

12:49.136 --> 12:51.304
pick up Grandma
and get to the jail by noon.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.506
Damn it.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.349
I'm just gonna have to get
an earlier start tomorrow,
that's all.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.517
Hey, Earl.
Hey, Crab Man.

13:04.551 --> 13:09.189
Here's a good one, Earl.
"Join the exciting world
of science research."

13:09.222 --> 13:11.491
Science, Earl.
Do you think that
could be my purpose?

13:11.524 --> 13:15.495
I don't know, Randy. Maybe your
purpose is stickin' with a job
for more than one day.

13:15.528 --> 13:19.967
Do you think when I find
my purpose I'll get some sort
of sign, like a glowing light?

13:20.000 --> 13:23.236
But not like an alien
abduction glowing light,
like a Jesus light?

13:23.270 --> 13:27.307
- I don't know, Randy.
I doubt it.
- Hi, Mr. Clean. Where you been?

13:27.340 --> 13:29.910
Promised my neighbor
you'd clean her trailer.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.045
Oh, it turns out
that's not my purpose.

13:32.079 --> 13:36.216
I'm gonna work in
"the ever-changin' landscape
of cosmetic testin'."

13:36.249 --> 13:38.451
Cosmetics?
[ Laughs ]

13:38.485 --> 13:42.022
There ain't enough cosmetics
in the world to cover your
dumb-lookin' face. [ Laughs ]

13:42.055 --> 13:45.158
Seriously. If they
send you free testers,
you better hook me up.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.497
[ Beeping ]

13:50.530 --> 13:53.533
[ Earl Narrating ]
7:00 a.m. is early
for a guy like me.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.203
But sometimes you have to do
what you have to do.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.040
[ Grunting ]

14:02.242 --> 14:03.843
[ Ringing ]

14:12.619 --> 14:16.056
As it turned out,
much like everything else
on this little chore,

14:16.089 --> 14:18.558
pickin' up Hank's grandma
wasn't easy.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.328
I drove around for an hour
before I found a parking spot.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.475
[ Earl Narrating ]
As disappointed as I was
with my day,

14:35.508 --> 14:38.946
Randy was more disappointed
with his new career in science.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.050
- Ready to get started?
- I guess.

14:48.321 --> 14:52.592
You can go home now.
Be sure to call us as soon
as you get your sight back.

14:52.625 --> 14:56.096
Thank you, Doctor.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, I'm no doctor.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.365
Hey, Darren,
this guy just
called me "Doctor."

14:59.432 --> 15:01.101
Oh!

15:01.134 --> 15:04.437
I don't think I like
the exciting world
of science anymore.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.974
It's not fun bein' blind.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.076
Why is Steven Wonder
always smilin'?

15:09.109 --> 15:13.546
Maybe he can't see
that he's smilin'.
Am I smilin', Earl?

15:13.580 --> 15:18.118
- No, Randy. You're not smilin'.
- Hey, Earl, could you
hand me the want ads?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.256
I'm gonna find another job.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.699
Hey, Earl, could you
read this for me?
No, I'm not gonna read to ya.

15:32.732 --> 15:36.369
I gotta get up at the crack
of dawn. I got my own problems
I'm dealin' with.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.505
At least you have
your sight.

15:38.538 --> 15:42.042
Randy, you were gonna
get a job so you could
be more independent.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.178
But so far I've had to give you
money for cleanin' supplies,
play doctor with you,

15:45.212 --> 15:48.281
and after dinner,
I'm literally gonna have to
help you use the bathroom.

15:48.315 --> 15:52.285
You don't have to hold anything.
Just get me on the seat.
I'll go like a girl.

15:52.319 --> 15:56.123
Randy, why don't you
just take the job as
a busboy at the Crab Shack?

15:57.357 --> 15:59.692
I don't wanna be
a busboy, Earl.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.595
I want somethin' cool,
like you have with your list.
I want a purpose.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.498
Well, maybe not everybody
has a purpose.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.168
But at least they contribute
and pull their own weight.

16:08.201 --> 16:12.439
If you really wanna help,
stop trying to do these crazy
jobs, and just go be a busboy.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.543
Fine.
I'll be a busboy.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.511
[ Earl ]
Good.

Who's there?
Who's there?

[ Beeping ]

16:34.361 --> 16:37.064
[ Earl Narrating ]
6:00 a.m. is early
for a guy like me.

16:37.097 --> 16:41.000
But I was determined that
today would be the day
that I gave Hank his good day.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.114
[ Ringing ]

17:14.334 --> 17:16.336
All right, let's get goin'.
Hank is waitin'.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.471
- Okeydokey.
- Oh, hey, you have to
take her drops.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.741
What?
Her eyedrops.
You have to put drops...

17:21.774 --> 17:26.213
in her eyes every 10 minutes
or they'll dry out and the lids
will stick to the balls.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.815
You don't wanna see that.
Her watch has a timer on it
to remind you.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.218
[ Man ]
No, you did it again.
Wrong one.

17:31.251 --> 17:34.254
- Oh, and, uh, she hates it,
so good luck.

17:38.358 --> 17:41.361
- Does that mean it's time
for your drops?
- No.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.697
I think that means
it's time for your drops.
No, it doesn't.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.570
Come on. I gotta
give you your drops,
or you'll dry up.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.140
I don't like 'em.
I know. Just give me
your head.

I don't wanna.
Give me you head.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.677
No!
You're gonna make me
wrestle you, aren't you?

17:57.710 --> 18:00.513
Yes.

Just relax!
It'll be easy.

take a second.

No problem.

- Hey, Earl.
- Hey, Crab Man.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.444
So, how was
your first day?
Fine, I guess.

18:31.478 --> 18:35.315
I made some money.
And who knows, maybe this
is my purpose in life.

18:35.348 --> 18:39.619
I am helpin' people.
They can't eat if other people's
plates are still on their table.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.922
I mean, they can,
but it would be crowded
and kinda gross. Hey.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.293
Maybe my purpose in life
is to make things less crowded
and less gross.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.628
Hmm.
How was prison?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.863
Didn't get there.
Gonna try again tomorrow.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.566

Can I hang out with you?

18:53.600 --> 18:56.569

have to get up real early.

start until 8:00.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.802
Why'd we have to
get up so early?

Because what took me
four days to try
and get done without you...

and a half with you.
I'm sorry.

No, Randy,
it means I need you.

Yeah. I shouldn't have
told you to take that job.

Yeah. Think about it.

of the things on this list.

with me when I fix 'em.

there to help me is yours.
