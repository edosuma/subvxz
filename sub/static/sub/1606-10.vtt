01:21.480 --> 01:23.005
Mmm.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.525
Mmm.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.448
Oh, my God.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.921
Horrible, wasn't it?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.526
The worst.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.650
You're really bad at that.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.211
Can I do you?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.002
You don't have to ask.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.481
I've never-
really-

02:05.040 --> 02:07.725
Gone down on a woman before?

02:08.240 --> 02:11.244
I mean, no.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.684
What kind of a lesbian are you?

02:14.760 --> 02:17.161
The boob-touching kind.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.964
All right, well...

02:20.760 --> 02:24.481
are you ready to take
the plunge, so to speak?

02:24.560 --> 02:26.244
Are you gonna coach me through it?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.890
Yeah.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.449
Shit.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.727
- Mmm.
-Mmm.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.921
Mmm.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.170
Shit. What time is it
in Amsterdam?

02:43.240 --> 02:45.004
I have no idea.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.082
Okay, um, give me a second.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.844
I'm sorry.
It's business.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.604
I'll be right back.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.965
Do you want a glass of water?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.883
Is that a part of it?

02:57.040 --> 02:58.405
Hydration?

03:06.880 --> 03:09.565
What the- Alex!

03:14.640 --> 03:17.564
Jesus! What the fuck?
Stop! Sylvie!

03:17.640 --> 03:19.210
- Oh, my God.
- Bitch!

03:19.280 --> 03:21.009
Stop it, Sylvie.
Shit.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.844
Jesus.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.843
She- She attacked me.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.922
- Are you fucking kidding?
- Stop. Piper-

03:27.000 --> 03:29.765
- She just broke in here.
- I live here!

03:31.120 --> 03:32.849
She does.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.922
That's my girlfriend, you whore.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.240
No.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.170
- Get her the fuck outta here.
- Okay, I will.

03:40.280 --> 03:44.171
- I'm gonna get her outta here, and then
we're gonna talk. - I said, get her out now!

03:44.240 --> 03:46.971
Sylvie. Come on, Sylvie.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.165
Your girlfriend?

03:49.880 --> 03:51.689
It's complicated, Piper.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.489
This is so fucked up.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.564
- I'm sorry. I should've said something.
- You think?

03:56.640 --> 03:58.130
Are you hurt?
Did she hurt you?

03:58.200 --> 04:01.443
She punched me in the face.
Yes, it hurts. Fuck.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.124
Where is my other shoe?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.521
I just-
I-I-I kept seeing you around...

04:05.640 --> 04:07.404
and, you know, I liked you.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.130
- And then when you called-
- Okay, stop it.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.248
Please, don't.
You're making it worse.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.004
Here.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.650
Did you find your other shoe?

04:14.720 --> 04:15.881
Forget it.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.725
Wait, you can't walk home
without your shoes.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.723
They're nice... shoes.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.409
They're from Marshalls.
Fuck you.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.370
<i>Movie night
will be this Wednesday at 1900 hours.</i>

04:28.440 --> 04:29.646
Strip.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.245
Good morning to you too.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.402
- Are you wearing perfume?
- I am, in fact.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.962
I put on a little spritz right before
I left the house. You have a good nose.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.850
I put almond extract
behind my ears sometimes.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.410
Makes me smell like a cookie.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.370
- Hmm.
- Anyway, let's get to the squat and cough.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.320
Okay.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.209
<i>Ladies, In-Out Program will begin in one hour.</i>

04:53.280 --> 04:55.726
Well, well, there she is.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.484
The prodigal daughter returns.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.531
Yep. It's not even 8:00 AM,
and I've already been felt up three times.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.523
- How was it?
- Not enough nipple play.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.650
Funny. So, you don't want
to talk about it?

05:07.720 --> 05:09.688
I'm, uh, still processing,
you know?

05:09.760 --> 05:12.923
Awkward conversations with old people,
bad cheese plates...

05:13.040 --> 05:16.965
a funeral, a wedding,
malt liquor.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.247
A whole lifetime
in 48 hours.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.845
You know
what was so weird?

05:20.920 --> 05:23.287
Eating off of plates
that weren't plastic.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.885
They felt so heavy.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.642
Did you, by any chance,
have time?

05:33.640 --> 05:35.529
I did.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.931
I'm afraid to ask.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.691
It was great.
It was really great.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.888
And that is such a cute part
of Queens.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.281
- I've never spent much time there.
- Did you go in?

05:46.840 --> 05:48.490
For a minute.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.530
You know, it's doing really well.
There was even a line.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.329
But you ordered something?

05:53.400 --> 05:54.845
Yes.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.527
A, um, one of those-
The sweet-

05:58.600 --> 06:01.251
<i>- Vatrushki. </i>
- Yes.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.529
- I do them with peach puree in
the summertime. - Delicious.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.524
It's such
a beautiful place, Red.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.888
<i>TB testing
for high-risk inmates, 0730 hours.</i>

06:10.960 --> 06:13.964
I can really see
why you are so proud of it.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.764
Thank you, really.

06:16.840 --> 06:20.083
My boys had told me
business was bad, and, you know...

06:20.160 --> 06:22.481
from in here,
there's nothing I can do.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.641
Thank God
they turned it around.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.127
So, how was it with Larry?

06:30.600 --> 06:34.650
Bizarre, sad, officially over...

06:34.720 --> 06:37.371
and he fucked someone else.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.885
He told you this?

06:39.000 --> 06:43.688
In the middle of a drunken,
grief-stricken sexual encounter.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.649
But you know
what the weirdest thing was?

06:45.720 --> 06:48.530
I wasn't even mad at all.
It kind of made sense.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.090
Tit for tat.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.767
Or, well, tit for tit,
as the case may be.

06:53.840 --> 06:58.641
Oh, honey.
You're a bigger woman than I am.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.609
- Who was it?
- I didn't want to know.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.889
- Oh, bullshit.
- No, really. I didn't want to know.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.887
He told me it was someone I-l know,
and a name would just make it worse.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.930
But you know who it probably was?
Our neighbor, Natalie.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.002
She's a Bikram teacher.

07:14.120 --> 07:18.045
She's very touchy-feely.
She's always offering us lots of free classes.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.126
But who cares?
It doesn't matter anyway.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.009
We broke up.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.890
I'm the one who cheated first,
right?

07:29.880 --> 07:31.928
Some mail came for you.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.280
It's from Vause.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.603
And thank you
for taking the time for me.

07:44.680 --> 07:49.049
You will be getting
some very nice lip gloss.

07:49.500 --> 07:57.300
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

07:57.720 --> 08:01.725
<i>Don't forget, ladies,
your usual meal is 1,500 calories.</i>

08:01.800 --> 08:04.041
<i>Be aware of overeating.</i>

08:08.600 --> 08:10.170
<i>Any available officers...</i>

08:10.240 --> 08:12.402
<i>to the admin building
for prisoner transport.</i>

08:12.480 --> 08:14.767
There's two waffles on there.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.205
Thank you.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.604
You got something to say
to me?

08:36.679 --> 08:38.568
My girls need your seat.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.244
And when I'm done,
they can have it.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.130
Done yet?

09:02.560 --> 09:05.450
You are a very rude woman.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.170
Oh, you wound me.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.483
Yo, damn, Vee.
Yo, we like ballers up in here.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.484
What did I tell y'all?
When you got something people want-

09:15.560 --> 09:18.723
Yo. This morning,
Underbite Clementino...

09:18.800 --> 09:22.486
was waiting for me in the bathroom
to give me a back massage.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.130
- What?
- A back massage.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.761
Like, I'm fucking Beyoncé
in a yacht in Saint-Tropez, okay?

09:30.280 --> 09:33.921
Make it rain, bitches.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.805
Commissary queen
in the hizzy.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.044
Fuck, this feels good.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.690
I cleaned Chang out.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.843
“You take-a the everything.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.082
Nothing reft
for the other lady.”

09:49.160 --> 09:52.562
Yo, didn't I tell you
that Vee was gonna take care of us?

09:52.640 --> 09:55.450
- Mm-hmm. - System work you, you got
to find a way to work the system.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.000
- Amen!
- Hallelujah!

10:00.360 --> 10:02.931
Who cuts your hair?
Danita?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.525
Hell no.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.001
I wouldn't let that butcher
near me with a pair of scissors.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.570
I do it myself.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.768
Don't look at the back.
It's a mess.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.962
What's the occasion?

10:13.040 --> 10:14.804
My son's coming to visit.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.406
Ah. Well, don't be upset
if he doesn't notice.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.484
Boys are stupid.
They never notice things like that.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.609
Michael hasn't seen me
in a long time.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.170
He's never come before.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.371
Why not?

10:28.200 --> 10:29.964
He was pissed off...

10:30.040 --> 10:32.247
or ashamed or both.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.605
He turned me in.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.689
So you're strangling him
at the beginning of the visit or at the end?

10:40.760 --> 10:45.368
He was only 12... and angry.
He's been through a lot.

10:45.440 --> 10:50.321
I'm gonna sit back,
let him vent, you know, get it all out.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.006
Well, if it were me,
I'd kick him to death...

10:53.080 --> 10:55.686
but we all have
our own way of parenting.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.883
Gandhi did it to protest
the caste system.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.201
It's the only way to make
a real difference.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.763
You're wasting your breath. You're not
gonna convince this crowd not to eat.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.444
She's right.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.564
I mean, this oatmeal tastes like
a bowl of chunky boogers...

11:10.640 --> 11:13.530
but, fuck, if it isn't comforting
to keep shoveling it in.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.207
So, I suppose you're all happy
with the way things are going?

11:17.320 --> 11:20.324
You think the conditions in this
prison are perfectly fine...

11:20.400 --> 11:25.167
that federal money should be spent on making
women shower in feces-soaked stalls...

11:25.240 --> 11:27.766
and face physical abuse
if they resist?

11:27.840 --> 11:30.241
Come on, Jane Fonda.
Have a little bit of sausage.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.368
Yeah, just a little bite.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.920
You look a bit pale.
How many days has it been?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.480
Come on. Leave her alone.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.369
Sister?

11:39.440 --> 11:41.329
I thought you, of all people,
would support me.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.722
Oh, honey.
It's not Guantanamo.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.924
Move over, Soso.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.809
Fine.
I'll do it alone.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.570
That is really disrespectful.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.646
How was furlough?
Did you bring me back a T-shirt?

12:14.360 --> 12:17.603
Holy shit, dude. Wow.
What's it say?

12:17.680 --> 12:19.523
Hey, let me guess. Oh.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.331
“Hey, girl. Uh, sorry I fucked
you over in Chicago.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.880
It was for your own good.
Let me lick your pussy.”

12:24.960 --> 12:29.409
Probably, but I don't know.
I haven't read it.

12:29.480 --> 12:33.724
What? Man, that's some
serious willpower right there.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.768
- Aren't you curious?
- Of course I'm curious.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.285
It's the first one I haven't
thrown away.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.970
So, fucking read it already.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.849
- I'll do it.
- No! No, no, no, no, no.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.241
That is exactly what she wants.

12:43.320 --> 12:47.166
Yes, that is generally what people want
when they send a piece of correspondence.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.244
- What could she possibly say
that I want to hear? -

12:50.320 --> 12:53.961
She's a liar. She's always been a liar,
from the very beginning.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.691
Doesn't everyone lie
to everyone?

12:58.320 --> 13:02.006
She knows that if she keeps
sending these, eventually I will crack...

13:02.080 --> 13:06.324
and then she'll apologize and she'll say
all the right things, and fuck that.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.802
But you're not gonna throw it away either.
You miss her.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.121
Of course I miss her.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.487
I hate that she has
this hold on me.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.289
I'm so sick of it.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.167
This oatmeal tastes like snot.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.447
I'll take a sh-shot.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.845
It's all good.
Okay, I got this one.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.121
Oh! That was terrible.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.881
Mmm. Whoo!

13:46.840 --> 13:48.729
Hey.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.241
Hey.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.483
What are you doing here?

13:58.560 --> 14:00.881
Oh, I just, um-

14:00.960 --> 14:03.531
- I heard about the burlesque show.
- Oh.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.728
- You?
- My friend Rachel's in it.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.246
She does this routine
with a Ray Romano puppet.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.764
It's surprisingly sexy.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.603
L-Look, I'm really sorry
about that night, Piper.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.603
I'm not
a shady person.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.444
Oh, come on.
Don't worry about it.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.921
I mean, I've never been
punched before.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.923
It was probably
a good life experience.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.606
I meant it when I said
that things were complicated.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.968
I'm new to this whole relationship thing,
you know?

14:41.040 --> 14:44.442
I don't-
I don't know the rules.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.688
That's the whole problem,
isn't it?

14:49.040 --> 14:51.281
Rules aren't any fun.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.604
Listen, I don't want to stand
in the way of true love.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.523
I mean, if that is
your future wife out there...

15:08.600 --> 15:11.285
by all means,
tell me to back off.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.690
But you pursued me...

15:13.760 --> 15:16.001
and I liked it.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.687
I've-
I've never felt-

15:21.480 --> 15:25.804
You know, I've never really thought of myself
as a very sexual person, but...

15:27.000 --> 15:28.206
ever since-

15:33.720 --> 15:35.643
I want to taste
what you taste like.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.848
What were they serving in there, Red?
Humble pie?

16:05.920 --> 16:09.527
- Crow? Whipped old lady?
- You been practicing those?

16:09.600 --> 16:12.604
High-horse hamburger?
Egg on your face?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.170
Did you eat your hat?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.325
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.641
How you doin'?

16:25.720 --> 16:29.441
Did you cry it out the other night
after your little lady meltdown?

16:29.520 --> 16:32.364
Oh, come on, man. Relax.
Shit, loosen up.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.762
It's like my mom used to say,
“Wipe that puss off your face.”

16:35.840 --> 16:38.286
Course, that was before I learned
I liked puss on my face.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.923
It's a new day, Benerino.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.964
What the fuck is this?

16:46.040 --> 16:49.647
<i>The Big House Bugle ?</i> Clearly, you
supported this prisoner propaganda.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.882
They did a nice
cover story on me.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.487
And none of you morons caught on
that the walrus in the comic is Healy?

16:55.560 --> 16:57.244
I thought it was pretty funny.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.882
And who do you think is the pig in high heels
carrying around the bags of money?

17:02.560 --> 17:04.847
You got me there.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.122
Oh.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.050
Who's in charge
of this garbage?

17:10.119 --> 17:12.930
That would be Chapman,
Inmate-In-Chief.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.923
I don't want to see
this shit again.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.685
You might want to reconsider. You can use
all of the journalistic spin you can get.

17:18.760 --> 17:24.050
- Why? - Your favorite rapist guard
has exceeded all expectations.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.770
The Diaz girl is pregnant.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.411
- Are you sure?
- Tested her this morning.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.891
Jesus.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.167
Big, bad baby daddy.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.442
And you brought him back.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.761
Fuck me.
I gotta get out in front of this.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.128
Mendez can't know anything
until I frame the whole thing.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.725
You're keeping him at work?

17:42.800 --> 17:46.566
Just until I get my ducks in a row.
This thing has to be handled right.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.641
You want me to keep this
under wraps...

17:50.720 --> 17:52.961
you're gonna have to do
something for me.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.041
What?

17:54.120 --> 17:56.407
When it's time...

17:56.480 --> 17:58.164
I get to fire the bastard.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.845
Fine.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.685
- So, why a Russian?
- I don't know.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.491
I just, uh, did some online research...

18:08.560 --> 18:13.600
and I found that the top-rated mail-order sites
were either Eastern Europeans or Orientals.

18:13.680 --> 18:18.481
So, I figured there'd be
less cultural barriers with the Russians.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.769
And there was money exchanged?

18:21.840 --> 18:23.729
I'm sorry. I'm not familiar with-

18:23.800 --> 18:26.041
You know, I-I don't need
your judgment, okay?

18:26.120 --> 18:29.761
'Cause from the looks of it, you know,
I'm guessing your love life isn't so hot either.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.606
Perhaps you're projecting
your experiences onto me, Sam.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.603
Oh, let's cut
the fuckin' psychobabble, okay?

18:35.680 --> 18:38.286
I have a wife that I paid for.
So fuckin' what?

18:38.360 --> 18:41.125
I don't need you goin' around
throwin' out these textbook terms...

18:41.200 --> 18:43.043
like some condescending know-it-all.

18:43.120 --> 18:47.205
This is what I do for a living too.
I'm a counselor.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.769
Why did you come here?

18:49.840 --> 18:52.127
You know, I don't fucking know
why I came here.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.487
Because I don't need
your fuckin' help.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.608
Because I'm the one
that's helpin' people.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.603
All day long.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.205
Do you?

19:01.320 --> 19:03.971
Do you really help people?

19:04.080 --> 19:06.082
You bet your ass I do.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.490
Man, these tracks
itchin' somethin' fierce.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.564
I got to get these to Vee
so she can get 'em out to her people.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.291
Yo, how many stamps
you need to send stamps?

19:16.360 --> 19:18.089
Yo, you got a second?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.525
I know y'all are dealing.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.165
Yeah, so?

19:24.240 --> 19:26.049
So, you lied to me, T.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.203
- Like you never sold drugs.
- I sold weed, not real shit.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.886
Real enough to get your ass
locked in here.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.247
So don't be acting all high siddity.

19:34.360 --> 19:39.491
In case you ain't notice,
this place is full of criminals...

19:39.560 --> 19:41.369
and we're two of 'em.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.807
Three, if you include
cuckoo over here.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.884
Yo. We's gettin' paid, man.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.930
Our crew rules.
Fuck the police.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.565
What? Now you all gangster?

19:51.640 --> 19:53.927
Man, y'all are fuckin' brainwashed.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.570
You're jealous.

19:55.640 --> 19:59.565
Jealous of what?
You acting like a hood rat corner kid?

19:59.640 --> 20:02.530
You don't know
where I come from.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.728
I ain't have no daddy
in the army...

20:04.800 --> 20:10.250
parents lookin' out for me,
and a fuckin' winter coat, you bougie bitch.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.369
So don't pretend
like you know me or my people.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.482
Thought you wanted
to be better than that.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.481
Get the fuck outta my bunk.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.448
Yo! It's a sweep.
They sweepin'!

20:27.480 --> 20:30.609
Inmates! Outside your bunks now!

20:30.680 --> 20:33.047
Don't move a muscle.

20:33.120 --> 20:36.920
I see you swallow anything or tuck
anything away, your ass goes to the box.

20:42.360 --> 20:46.888
Aaah! I think I did the left side
too much, right? The arch is too high?

20:46.960 --> 20:49.440
Eh, it kind of looks like you're
really skeptical about everything.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.050
I think the leery look is hot.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.122
- “A” Dorm!
- Fuck!

20:53.200 --> 20:55.362
- Sweep time!
- They're gonna take my lipstick.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.642
Sweep time, ladies.

20:57.720 --> 20:58.846
Fuck.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.408
Shit.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.489
Inmate, outside.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.448
Illegal foodstuffs.
That's a shot.

21:20.520 --> 21:24.764
Nail polish. Sharp tweezers.
There goes your phone time, inmate.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.600
Jackpot! I doubt these
are super-absorbent, huh?

21:34.680 --> 21:36.921
Whose bunk is this? Watson.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.724
How much these little rollies
goin' for, huh?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.565
- Got yourself a little business?
- No, sir.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.768
Don't you “No, sir” me!

21:45.840 --> 21:48.207
You start marchin'
your pretty black ass to the SHU!

21:48.280 --> 21:50.248
I know how much you love it in there!

21:50.320 --> 21:51.765
Move!

21:56.080 --> 21:57.844
I'll take that.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.844
<i>Reminder, ladies, possession of a uniform...</i>

22:05.920 --> 22:09.811
<i>that is not your own
is a violation of code 296.</i>

22:12.360 --> 22:15.887
Aw.
You have my card.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.844
Kids are cute, right?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.126
Hmph.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.009
It was between this
or some cats that said...

22:23.080 --> 22:24.764
“You're purr-fect.”

22:26.640 --> 22:28.210
Yep.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.806
I made the right choice.

22:37.760 --> 22:41.970
You look so different.
Softer somehow, in a good way.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.566
I'm gonna let you keep that.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.645
Clear!

23:06.880 --> 23:08.450
Jesus, what a haul.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.569
I'm takin' this home
after I rip it open and check for drugs.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.529
It's adorable.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.887
Look at all this stuff.
There's some serious open channels here.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.167
- Here, smell this, would ya?
- Whoa.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.242
That's awful.
Smell it.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.210
- Oh, it smells like poo.
- Yeah, it all smells like poo.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.770
You know what that means?

23:24.880 --> 23:27.008
It's all comin' in
through the rectal pipeline.

23:28.440 --> 23:32.445
Someone has been slackin'
with the squat and cough.

23:32.520 --> 23:36.161
You know what this means? It's not
enough to look. We got to start probin'.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.765
We can't touch 'em.
It's illegal.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.047
- I'm not sticking my arm up there.
- What about a finger?

23:40.120 --> 23:43.488
What's wrong with that?
A finger's nice once in a while.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.927
Visual inspections only.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.729
Tiny little finger?

23:47.800 --> 23:52.442
Come on. I don't know about you all,
but I'm ready to be the hero.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.010
Nothing's gettin' past me.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.885
You didn't see what you thought
you saw, end of story.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.486
- What was it then?
- Oh, Jesus, really?

23:59.560 --> 24:01.210
Look, I'm not gonna
leave you alone.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.408
I am not doing anything.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.130
Do you want to join me
in the bathroom?

24:05.200 --> 24:06.964
'Cause that's where I'm headed,
to take a dump.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.042
Come on. You can hand me
neatly folded squares of paper...

24:09.120 --> 24:11.646
like you're the groom of the stool
and I'm Henry the Eighth.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.123
How would you rate
your state of mind today?

24:21.200 --> 24:22.690
A four.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.683
You having any
angry thoughts?

24:24.760 --> 24:26.728
They coming up regularly
for you?

24:26.800 --> 24:31.488
Are you having angry
thoughts that are comin' up regularly?

24:31.560 --> 24:34.928
- That's projection.
- What does that mean?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.606
You have any idea what I do
for a livin', what my job is?

24:37.680 --> 24:39.330
Of course I do.

24:39.400 --> 24:43.041
You- You fill out the paperworks
for the ladies that get shots.

24:45.480 --> 24:48.051
I provide guidance.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.202
I counsel people
with their problems.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.248
Oh.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.164
I'm thinking about starting
a support group.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.527
It's a therapy thing.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.007
I think the women here
could really use it.

25:01.080 --> 25:04.163
There's some angry bitches around here.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.801
But you know that ain't nobody gonna do
nothin' without gettin' somethin' from it.

25:07.880 --> 25:12.647
They will be getting something.
Help with their problems.

25:12.720 --> 25:17.282
No, I'm talkin' about, like,
free doughnuts or days off work.

25:17.360 --> 25:20.409
I've, uh, printed out some flyers.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.609
I'd like you to distribute them.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.887
All right, Mr. Healy,
but I'm tellin' you...

25:27.960 --> 25:30.008
no one's gonna come
on their own.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.162
You're underestimating them.

25:32.240 --> 25:36.245
These women have been through a lot.
They'll come.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.284
Didn't realize y'all
had such literary interests.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.006
Yeah, well, we were hopin' you
could make a few suggestions...

25:53.080 --> 25:56.289
'cause from what I hear,
you're quite the little critic.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.850
Yeah, I got some thoughts.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.649
- Yeah?
- And some questions.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.200
Like why you let my girl Janae
get dragged off to Seg?

26:02.280 --> 26:05.523
Well, she knew better than
to keep contraband in her bunk.

26:05.600 --> 26:09.400
I guess she got a lot
of alone time now to think about it.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.450
She'll be fine, so long as she
thinks and doesn't speak.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.365
You in or out?

26:18.440 --> 26:20.841
The library's
prime real estate for us.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.845
Look, you got your spot.
Deal out of there.

26:24.920 --> 26:28.208
There's no reason for the inmates
to flow through the warehouse.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.123
There's no excuse to browse.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.043
Plus, the hacks
got a taste of blood.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.600
It's only a matter of time
before they sweep all the work sites.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.729
I ain't no corner girl.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.561
I like this spot.

26:42.960 --> 26:46.931
So, you either get your ass in line
or request a transfer.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.247
I hear electrical is looking.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.207
You feel me?

26:53.400 --> 26:56.006
I ain't goin' nowhere.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.764
You feel me?

27:05.680 --> 27:07.967
Miss Diaz, we just need
verbal confirmation...

27:08.040 --> 27:11.044
that Officer Mendez
forced himself on you.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.009
- Can you provide that?
- Didn't you see it?

27:15.840 --> 27:19.447
This is for our paperwork.

27:19.520 --> 27:23.002
Joe, I think Miss Diaz would be more
comfortable if you weren't in the room.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.085
Look, there are laws
in place...

27:39.160 --> 27:42.607
which criminalize sex between
prisoners and prison staff...

27:42.720 --> 27:46.008
which means that employees
who engage in sexual misconduct...

27:46.080 --> 27:49.084
cannot claim consent
as a defense.

27:49.160 --> 27:53.643
So, officially, it's a rape, yes,
and we're all gonna call it that.

27:53.720 --> 27:57.611
But I need to know, girl-to-girl,
was it consensual?

27:59.840 --> 28:02.844
Listen, I get it. You're lonely.
You want to flirt a little.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.922
Attention from a guard
makes you feel special.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.368
I mean, those uniforms alone
can be a real turn-on, right?

28:08.440 --> 28:12.809
So, just between us,
I need to know if you encouraged him.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.890
- Yes.
- I thought as much.

28:20.480 --> 28:23.450
Well, you've created quite
a headache for me, young lady.

28:23.520 --> 28:27.411
Now, not only am I responsible for you
but for your little spawn of the system.

28:27.480 --> 28:32.088
So do me a favor, sweetheart.
From now on, keep your legs closed.

28:33.720 --> 28:37.805
Congratulations.
You've officially destroyed a man's life.

28:40.960 --> 28:44.248
No. You gotta tell her that if the bank
is closed on Sunday...

28:44.320 --> 28:46.926
that there's no fucking late fee
if you pay her Monday morning.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.162
- That shit's not right.
- I did.

28:49.240 --> 28:51.481
- And she's still tryin' to charge you?
- Mm-hmm.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.325
Okay. So, here's
what you got to do.

28:54.400 --> 28:59.088
You get a baseball bat-
the wood kind, not the fucking metal kind-

28:59.160 --> 29:01.640
and a big trash bag...

29:01.760 --> 29:04.889
the black kind,
not the see-through kind.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.804
Michael.
You look all grown-up.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.928
You must have grown,
like, four inches.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.525
It's Mike now.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.526
Ah.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.763
Now take a look at his feet.

29:16.840 --> 29:21.209
I told him he's as tall layin' down
as he is standin' up.

29:23.280 --> 29:26.523
Anything you want
to say to me...

29:28.040 --> 29:30.884
you can say it, okay?

29:36.040 --> 29:38.611
Well, you know,
maybe we should play a game.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.205
Hmm?

29:40.280 --> 29:43.887
They got a deck of cards
over there by the kids' stuff. Huh?

29:47.800 --> 29:50.963
<i>When in the visitation
room, you're allowed two hugs-</i>

29:51.040 --> 29:53.202
<i>one on arrival
and one on departure.</i>

29:53.280 --> 29:55.965
Well, they still haven't fixed
the, uh, bathrooms...

29:56.040 --> 29:58.247
and they were supposed to
put in a retaining wall by the lake...

29:58.320 --> 29:59.970
but there's just
a couple of sandbags.

30:00.040 --> 30:03.840
I ran the name FCP, and it doesn't exist.
No trace of the company.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.446
- You sure that's the name you saw
on the truck? - I'm positive.

30:06.520 --> 30:11.003
Well, my guess is that the prison
is giving inflated contracts to companies...

30:11.120 --> 30:13.407
that are either shells
or subsidiaries of Fitzcore...

30:13.480 --> 30:17.087
and Fitzcore is paying kickbacks
into the Jason Figueroa campaign.

30:17.160 --> 30:21.370
What I <i>need</i> are invoices
so I can see who's getting paid.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.809
Right.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.484
Well-

30:26.560 --> 30:30.121
What about photos of all the unfinished work?
If I could get you a camera-

30:30.200 --> 30:32.851
No, why don't you get me
an iPhone...

30:32.920 --> 30:35.526
so then I can take pictures
and play Candy Crush?

30:35.600 --> 30:37.090
Are you insane?

30:37.160 --> 30:40.846
I told you before, I'm not risking
my freedom for your fucking byline.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.763
Piper, this woman is a criminal.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.729
Yeah, well, so am I.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.924
- Collectin' twos?
- Nope.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.562
Better for me.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.288
You sure about that?

30:59.600 --> 31:01.728
Hoo-hoo!

31:01.800 --> 31:03.325
You're kickin' my ass here.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.801
Yep. My turn to deal?

31:12.760 --> 31:14.285
Thank you.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.326
Mr. Nance.
What brings you here?

31:18.400 --> 31:21.165
Miss Figueroa.
Uh, how are you?

31:21.240 --> 31:23.686
Better once I know what the fuck
you're doing in my prison.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.445
- I was... visiting a friend.
- And what friend might that be?

31:26.520 --> 31:29.569
- You know, I've called your office
a bunch of times. - Have you?

31:29.640 --> 31:32.803
I can find out whose list you're on
in five seconds flat...

31:32.880 --> 31:35.281
so there's no need
to play games here.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.362
Piper Chapman.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.647
Piper Chapman.
And how do you know Piper Chapman?

31:39.720 --> 31:42.291
We have... mutual friends.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.328
Hmm.

31:56.480 --> 32:00.883
You seein' this shit? I mean,
it's like she's got a fuckin' hit out on me.

32:00.960 --> 32:05.727
I think she wants some of those cheesy puffs
you got. Maybe just give her a few.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.088
Oh, yeah. That must be it.
She's after my puffs.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.766
<i>- Hmm. <i>-
Morello, you have a visitor.</i></i>

32:11.840 --> 32:13.842
<i>Report to visitation, Morello.</i>

32:13.920 --> 32:15.809
That's you, kid.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.649
I'm not expecting anybody.
Maybe it's my sister.

32:20.720 --> 32:23.087
Geez, I hope there's nothing wrong.
How do I look?

32:24.360 --> 32:25.885
- Fuckin' hot.
- All right.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.282
Stop!

32:32.360 --> 32:34.522
Man, at least get in here
where I can see you.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.489
How much longer is this shit
gonna go on for?

32:38.600 --> 32:42.047
- You need to take it to Red.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

32:45.240 --> 32:48.801
You really think I'm gonna throw away
two years of sobriety for one little high?

32:48.880 --> 32:51.611
I saw Tricia get wheeled
outta here in a body bag.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.808
How stupid do you think I am?

32:57.840 --> 33:02.368
<i>Any available officers
to the front gate for transfer.</i>

33:09.800 --> 33:12.406
- Well, hello. I-
- Don't you fuckin' touch me.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.691
Sit down.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.240
<i>Available officers to the admin building...</i>

33:18.320 --> 33:20.243
<i>for prisoner transport.</i>

33:20.320 --> 33:22.288
It's nice to see you.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.601
- I-I like your sweater.
- Listen to me.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.409
I know you
broke into my house.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.562
I don't know how you did it,
but you did.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.722
Now, the cops don't believe me,
but I know it was you.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.643
I don't understand.
Why did you come here?

33:32.720 --> 33:35.121
Because I wanna hear you say it.
Tell me it was you.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.447
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

33:37.520 --> 33:42.447
So, clearly your time in prison has done nothing
to bring you back into reality, you psycho.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.090
I swear to God...

33:45.160 --> 33:49.882
if you come near me or my family
or my wife again, ever...

33:49.960 --> 33:52.247
I will kill you
with my bare fucking hands.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.085
I will choke you
until you are dead.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.969
Could you keep your voice down
just a little?

33:57.040 --> 33:59.042
You- Are you- Why?

33:59.120 --> 34:01.805
You want me to keep my voice down
so your criminal friends in here...

34:01.880 --> 34:04.645
won't know that you're a mental case
who broke outta prison to stalk me?

34:06.680 --> 34:08.170
Is that him?

34:10.480 --> 34:12.482
What is that?

34:12.560 --> 34:15.245
Are you trying to keep up
this lunatic charade...

34:15.320 --> 34:17.926
- pretend that I'm your boyfriend?
- No.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.440
I don't know
this woman, okay?

34:24.520 --> 34:27.045
We went on one date. One.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.565
She's a fucking stalker.

34:28.639 --> 34:31.120
Sir, you need to leave now.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.009
She's fuckin' dangerous, okay?

34:33.080 --> 34:34.889
- Leave now.
- She-

34:34.960 --> 34:37.281
You know she broke outta here, right?

34:37.360 --> 34:40.330
- She's a psycho bitch.
- Sorry.

34:40.400 --> 34:44.007
- Come on.
- Hey, man, I'm not the criminal here, okay?

34:57.240 --> 34:58.730
Shh.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.401
I'm crazy.
I'm a crazy person.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.768
There is somethin'
really wrong with me.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.969
There's somethin' wrong with all of us.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be in here.

35:12.040 --> 35:15.840
No. I did something bad.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.445
Really bad.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.569
When I was supposed to be
at the hospital...

35:20.680 --> 35:25.481
I stole the van, and I went
to his house in Albany.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.565
Are you serious?

35:29.520 --> 35:32.126
Do you know what could have
happened if you got caught?

35:32.200 --> 35:35.329
I think they charge you with felony escape-
triple your sentence.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.971
I know. Believe me, I know.

35:38.040 --> 35:41.726
Well, don't fuckin'
do that again, you maniac.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.609
Seriously.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.365
It's a miracle that you-you
didn't get caught.

35:46.440 --> 35:49.887
I just wanted to see him.

35:51.400 --> 35:56.611
But he's so mean.
I mean, he's really mean.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.524
He's not the man
that I thought he was.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.803
Do you hate me?

36:02.880 --> 36:04.723
No, I don't hate you.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.325
Really?

36:06.400 --> 36:11.088
But it's getting clearer every second
that you're totally batshit crazy.

36:11.160 --> 36:14.130
But you're
a beautiful, sweet girl.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.170
Fuck this guy.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.811
So many people
are gonna love you.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.689
No. No.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.808
Nobody's gonna love me.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.562
I do.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.443
Come here.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.441
Hi. Larry, it's me.

36:43.520 --> 36:47.889
Listen, I know that I said I didn't
want to know who it was- and I didn't-

36:47.960 --> 36:52.284
but being in here, it just has
a way of making you obsess...

36:52.360 --> 36:56.888
and feel a little crazy-jealous.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.760
So, I know this is totally unfair,
but it's how I feel.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.047
So, I just think it would
be better if I knew-

37:03.120 --> 37:06.567
if I just knew who it was,
and then I could stop guessing.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.723
Your phone time is up.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.484
I- I'm just-

37:14.000 --> 37:15.968
Um, bye.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.690
That's right.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.525
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

37:20.600 --> 37:23.444
- Move along.
- I was done anyway.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.727
I'm not gay. I'm not.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.202
I'm just experimenting.
I don't know.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.250
Maybe all of the guys
that I've been with so far...

37:35.320 --> 37:39.370
have just been really bad
in bed, but I'm telling you...

37:39.440 --> 37:43.843
it's like I just discovered
what sex is supposed to be.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.969
- But she has a girlfriend?
- Mmm, she had a girlfriend.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.646
They were having problems.
It's over.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.722
- For sure?
- Yeah.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.121
I don't know, Piper.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.009
Who is that?

38:06.880 --> 38:09.167
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

38:09.240 --> 38:10.765
There's shit
in that bag!

38:10.840 --> 38:13.002
You fell for that? That's, like,
the oldest trick in the book.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.809
What is the oldest trick
in the book, poop?

38:14.880 --> 38:17.281
In a bag? On fire?

38:17.360 --> 38:19.249
Yes. My brother
and his friends used to do it.

38:19.320 --> 38:21.129
It's so fucking stupid.
It's a prank.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.486
Oh.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.721
Ugh.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.485
Oh, my God.
It's her.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.881
- Who?
- Sylvia. Alex's ex.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.962
- Really?
- Yeah, she's fucking crazy.

38:31.040 --> 38:34.647
She attacked me.
This- This is her. I know it.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.371
Do you think it's human shit?

38:37.440 --> 38:40.410
No, I mean, this is-
this is dog shit, right?

38:40.480 --> 38:43.450
I mean, if she's really
as crazy as you say.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.808
You don't think that she squatted
and pooped in a bag, do you?

38:48.320 --> 38:50.049
Well, she did get her point across.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.804
I'll give her that much.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.645
Lesbians are insane.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.610
I can't believe she said that to you.
The fuckin' nerve. Jesus.

38:57.680 --> 39:01.207
She was right. I seduced him.
We set him up.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.408
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

39:03.480 --> 39:06.882
- It's wrong. He's goin' to jail, John.
- What is the alternative?

39:06.960 --> 39:10.362
You want me to stand up and shout,
“Hey, everyone, that's my baby in there”?

39:10.440 --> 39:12.886
In my neighborhood,
real men stand up and claim their kids.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.610
We're not in your neighborhood,
are we?

39:14.680 --> 39:16.603
What the fuck do you
want from me, Daya?

39:16.680 --> 39:18.887
Stand up and tell the world
that you love me.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.890
That is insane. They would
cart me off in front of the local news.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.486
- Is that what you want?
- No. Yes.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.325
I don't know what I want.
It just feels really bad.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.641
Daya, I would go to jail.

39:30.920 --> 39:32.684
Well, then at least we'll be even.

39:59.160 --> 40:03.404
If you're here to mock me,
I don't have the energy to argue.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.209
Everything hurts.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.203
I'm not here
to make fun of you.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.281
Really?

40:10.480 --> 40:15.042
I watched a friend get taken
to the SHU yesterday.

40:15.120 --> 40:17.407
That's the second time
she's been in there...

40:17.480 --> 40:19.721
and the first time
was rough.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.848
I'm sick and tired
of the guards...

40:21.920 --> 40:25.891
using solitary like it's
some kind of toddler time-out.

40:27.240 --> 40:30.164
These are not violent offenders.

40:31.520 --> 40:35.366
It's inhumane, and it's torture.

40:37.160 --> 40:41.688
I think what you're doing
is very, very brave.

40:44.440 --> 40:47.205
You are a true activist.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.929
- Did you hand out all the flyers I gave you?
- Of course I did.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.161
Yes, sir.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.330
- But I really don't think anybody's co-
- I know, Doggett.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.050
I got it.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.124
<i>Recreation sign-up is now full.</i>

41:17.200 --> 41:19.441
- Hey, Pol.
- Hi.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.488
- Oh, my gosh. You're so skinny.
- Oh.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.847
Your big pregnancy ass is gone.

41:23.960 --> 41:26.247
I know.

41:27.280 --> 41:30.011
I am so sorry
it's been so long...

41:30.080 --> 41:32.606
and, Pipe,
I'm sorry about Celeste.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.603
I should've been
at the funeral.

41:34.720 --> 41:38.645
I just- I'm not making that much milk,
and pumping is really hard.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.088
- Larry says you've been lost in the baby fog.
- I feel horrible.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.208
You lost someone.
I should've been there for you.

41:44.280 --> 41:47.284
I'm so, so sorry.
It was really shitty of me.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.448
- Stop. It's fine.
- It's not. It's not fine.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.170
You needed me,
and I wasn't there.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.163
I've been a really bad friend,
like, the worst.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.921
You don't deserve that.
You don't deserve any of this.

41:59.400 --> 42:00.845
How is mommy life?

42:00.920 --> 42:03.571
Hard. It's so much harder
than anyone tells you.

42:03.640 --> 42:06.325
I feel like I've lost my mind.
I'm not myself.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.050
- Is Pete being good?
- Pete took off to Alaska.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.521
It was weird
and totally horrible of him.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.841
Have you seen Larry a lot?

42:12.920 --> 42:14.968
No. Why, did he tell you that?

42:15.040 --> 42:17.202
I-I mean,
just when Pete was gone.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.567
- He helped me a lot with Finn.
- Oh.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.728
Are-Are you guys
still talking a lot?

42:21.800 --> 42:24.121
Well, we just spent
the past 48 hours together.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.248
How did that go?

42:27.320 --> 42:32.724
We had sex. Well, we started to,
at my grandmother's wake.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.724
- Really?
- Does that surprise you?

42:35.800 --> 42:39.043
Uh, well, yeah.
I-I thought you ended things.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.606
He was my fiancé, Polly.
There's still a lot of love there.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.648
Of course.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.728
He slept with someone else.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.325
Really?

42:48.400 --> 42:52.450
- Did he tell you that?
- No. Why would he tell me that?

42:52.520 --> 42:57.321
You two have been talking, you're close,
he's been helping you with Finn-

42:57.400 --> 42:59.004
Oh, we're not that close.

43:01.800 --> 43:04.804
Um, what did he tell you?

43:08.200 --> 43:10.282
That it was someone I know.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.681
I think he was feeling
pretty guilty.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.890
He probably felt like
it was a mistake.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.650
He doesn't want to hurt you.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.603
I'm sure that he doesn't.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.089
<i>Do you think she's gonna murder me?</i>

43:31.160 --> 43:33.731
Just how unstable
is this Sylvia person?

43:33.840 --> 43:36.002
- It was a joke.
- It was not a joke.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.447
It was
a very clear message.

43:38.520 --> 43:41.808
“I know what you did, bitch,
and I want you to know that I know.”

43:42.920 --> 43:46.891
Look. Being with you
was my choice.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.645
I wasn't happy.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.484
And then I took advantage
of that.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.722
I'm a grown-up, Piper.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.882
Do you think that
she's gonna come after me?

43:57.680 --> 44:01.207
Look, I think that she needed
to get it out of her system, all right?

44:01.280 --> 44:05.001
Sometimes you gotta rage
in order to move on.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.728
Did you love her?

44:10.840 --> 44:12.046
No.

44:13.920 --> 44:15.843
But I love you.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.044
You do?

44:32.560 --> 44:34.562
I don't say that to everyone.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.445
You have to say it back.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.403
I love you too.

45:10.280 --> 45:12.601
Do you want to talk about it?

45:12.680 --> 45:13.761
No.

45:22.400 --> 45:25.722
Remember I told you that my fiance
fucked somebody else?

45:25.800 --> 45:27.165
Yeah.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.328
It was my best friend.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.122
Oh.

45:36.360 --> 45:38.044
Can I be alone
for a minute, please?

45:38.120 --> 45:39.884
Sure, honey.

45:42.520 --> 45:46.411
<i>Inmate 3155,
you can go to the infirmary now.</i>

45:51.320 --> 45:56.281
Honey, you don't drink poison
and wait for it to kill your enemy.

45:56.360 --> 46:00.206
Stop hitting walls
and plot your revenge.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.001
Oh, fuck.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.531
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

48:21.000 --> 48:26.040
You know, I think I'd like to join
your little gardening club.

48:26.120 --> 48:28.646
We're not accepting
new members.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.010
A tunnel, Red?

48:31.080 --> 48:33.811
That is so Bugs Bunny.

48:33.880 --> 48:36.201
What are you gonna do,
turn me in?

48:36.280 --> 48:37.964
No, I'm gonna use it.

48:38.960 --> 48:40.724
You have your own operation.

48:40.800 --> 48:42.802
Yeah, I know,
but this is better.

48:42.880 --> 48:46.487
Fewer people involved and
no unstable vendor connections.

48:46.560 --> 48:48.642
- You're not taking it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

48:48.720 --> 48:53.044
I wouldn't want to deprive your girls
of their shit-flavored panty hose.

48:53.920 --> 48:56.241
We could share.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.607
You don't know
how to share.

48:58.680 --> 49:01.524
Just to take
and to bully.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.325
We used to be friends once.

49:06.800 --> 49:08.928
I want to be
friends again, man.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.368
Some friend.

49:13.440 --> 49:15.363
Will you think about it, huh?

49:17.600 --> 49:21.764
And would you think about how much
you've changed over the years?

49:22.760 --> 49:24.888
People change, Red.

50:40.720 --> 50:42.404
Hey.

50:42.480 --> 50:44.084
Nicky.

50:45.800 --> 50:48.121
Do you think people can change?

50:55.800 --> 50:57.848
I need you to take this
from me...

50:57.920 --> 51:00.002
'cause I'm gonna do it.

51:00.080 --> 51:01.650
And I really, really
don't want to.

51:05.160 --> 51:07.242
Who gave that to you?

51:07.320 --> 51:09.368
Taystee. Came from Vee.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.760
I'm so sorry, Red.
I-I let you down.

51:15.360 --> 51:18.569
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah.

51:18.640 --> 51:22.440
You brought it here.
You did good, Nicky.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.721
- You did.
- Yeah?

51:43.040 --> 51:45.520
Hey, girl.
Steady there.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.126
I'm fine. I'm good.

51:51.840 --> 51:54.320
- Yo, Vee.
- Yeah?

51:54.400 --> 51:57.609
- Fuck you.
- Oh, shit, girl. You're blind drunk.

51:57.680 --> 52:00.490
You wanna take my fuckin'
job assignment?

52:00.560 --> 52:03.166
You wanna take all my friends?
Well, fuck you!

52:03.240 --> 52:05.242
Somebody get her out of here
before she hurts herself.

52:05.320 --> 52:07.721
What the fuck?

52:11.440 --> 52:13.727
- Fuck!
- Don't you touch her!

52:21.360 --> 52:22.486
Ow!

52:26.120 --> 52:29.681
That's what you get
when you don't listen!

52:29.760 --> 52:33.321
That's what you get!

53:23.720 --> 53:25.085
Hello?

53:25.160 --> 53:26.844
<i>An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison...</i>

53:26.920 --> 53:28.524
<i>is attempting to contact you.</i>

53:28.640 --> 53:31.803
<i>To accept this call,
please press one.</i>

53:32.960 --> 53:34.883
Cal's phone.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.042
Neri. Hey. Is Cal there?

53:37.120 --> 53:38.849
<i>No, he's out foraging in the forest...</i>

53:38.920 --> 53:40.888
for greens that taste really green.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.849
But he's probably almost done.
Should I go get him?

53:43.880 --> 53:45.484
Actually, maybe you can help me.

53:45.560 --> 53:48.564
Yeah, sister-in-law.

53:48.640 --> 53:50.130
Whatever you need, dude.

53:50.200 --> 53:53.886
I need you to do me a favor.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.445
It's a big one.

54:16.960 --> 54:18.803
I deserve that.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.169
Barn.

54:24.280 --> 54:26.203
- All right.
- Hey.

54:27.200 --> 54:28.804
I'm proud of you.

54:28.880 --> 54:30.644
Then get the fuck outta here.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.284
What was that about?

54:36.360 --> 54:37.691
Nothin'.

54:41.320 --> 54:44.403
You ever seen an image
that sears itself into your brain?

54:44.480 --> 54:46.130
Like the movie about the hiker guy...

54:46.200 --> 54:50.808
where he cuts off his own arm
with a Swiss Army knife?

54:50.880 --> 54:54.089
Yeah, the-the sound, the tendons?

54:54.160 --> 54:57.881
Fuck! I wish
I never watched that part.

54:58.760 --> 55:00.250
You know what
tops that for me?

55:00.320 --> 55:03.881
You know what image I can't unsee,
it's still stuck in there...

55:03.960 --> 55:07.726
flickering at least once a day,
making me want to lose my lunch?

55:09.040 --> 55:10.530
No, sir.

55:10.600 --> 55:13.649
Your bare ass, Mendez.

55:13.720 --> 55:16.485
Your pimply, white ass...

55:16.560 --> 55:20.451
bouncing up and down between
the brooms and the mops...

55:20.520 --> 55:22.841
ramming into that poor girl-

55:22.920 --> 55:27.448
a girl you were supposed
to protect and keep safe.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.966
Your ass. It haunts me.

55:31.280 --> 55:33.362
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

55:34.440 --> 55:36.522
I've been doin' this kind
of work 25 years...

55:36.600 --> 55:39.206
and it's guys like you...

55:39.280 --> 55:42.727
that give the whole profession
a bad name.

55:42.800 --> 55:45.770
If it was up to me, you'd never set foot
on this property again.

55:45.840 --> 55:48.320
But considering the D.O.C.
didn't press charges...

55:48.400 --> 55:50.926
it was your word against mine.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.090
Until now.

55:56.680 --> 55:59.206
Well, I've been doin' my job, sir.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.408
Just gave out 15 shots this morning.

56:02.960 --> 56:04.610
You got her pregnant.

56:10.120 --> 56:11.121
No.

56:11.200 --> 56:14.283
Mmm. Sadly, for her, yes.

56:15.280 --> 56:17.169
That poor girl is carrying around...

56:17.240 --> 56:21.484
a sadistic little mustachioed shit
inside her.

56:22.040 --> 56:23.724
Whoa.

56:23.800 --> 56:26.849
Mendez, you're fucking fired.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.924
I understand, sir.

56:34.720 --> 56:37.200
Mm-mmm. No. I-I-I-

56:37.280 --> 56:39.282
I don't think you do understand.

56:40.840 --> 56:42.842
You're also under arrest.

56:45.280 --> 56:46.850
Your hand.

56:46.920 --> 56:48.570
Let me get that for you.

56:51.320 --> 56:52.845
All right, let's go.

56:55.720 --> 56:57.768
We're reporting
from Litchfield Federal Penitentiary...

56:57.840 --> 57:00.810
where the arrest
of Correctional Officer George Mendez...

57:00.880 --> 57:03.451
on charges of sexual assault
is under way.

57:03.520 --> 57:06.364
- There she is. -
I'm here with Natalie Figueroa...

57:06.440 --> 57:08.249
assistant warden of Litchfield Prison...

57:08.360 --> 57:11.967
and wife of Jason Figueroa,
who is currently running for state senate.

57:12.040 --> 57:16.045
Mrs. Figueroa, were you aware
of misconduct among your officers?

57:16.160 --> 57:20.563
Here are Litchfield,
we have a zero-tolerance policy...

57:20.640 --> 57:22.847
when it comes to sexual offenders.

57:24.640 --> 57:27.166
<i>Since the Prison Rape
Elimination Act...</i>

57:27.240 --> 57:32.406
<i>we have made it our mandate
to weed out rogue officers.</i>

57:35.040 --> 57:39.170
<i>These vulnerable women
are under our care...</i>

57:39.240 --> 57:43.006
<i>and we do everything
in our power to protect them.</i>

57:45.040 --> 57:50.331
<i>Of course, there are still bad people
in this world who commit heinous crimes...</i>

57:50.400 --> 57:55.804
<i>and it is unfortunate that one of these sickos
ended up under our roof.</i>

57:55.880 --> 57:59.851
<i>But I assure you, we are doing
everything in our power...</i>

57:59.920 --> 58:02.924
<i>to take care of this young woman...</i>

58:03.040 --> 58:06.089
<i>who is the real victim here.</i>

58:06.160 --> 58:08.128
- Wait for me, baby.
- All right, keep it movin'.

58:08.200 --> 58:10.726
You know what?
I don't care anymore.

58:11.880 --> 58:13.848
Go ahead! Arrest me!

58:13.920 --> 58:15.888
I love this woman!

58:15.960 --> 58:20.602
You hear me? That is my baby
in there, and I fuckin' love you!

58:20.680 --> 58:24.082
- Hey, hey.
- I want to call it Stan, okay?

58:24.160 --> 58:28.688
Don't lift anything heavy,
and no tuna fish or soft cheese!

58:28.760 --> 58:31.730
I'm comin' back for you, baby!
I'm gonna take care of you- both of you!

58:31.800 --> 58:33.325
Let's go.
You're done here.
