00:16.939 --> 00:20.542
It was a lighthearted song
at an informal event.

00:20.543 --> 00:22.078
Yeah, she's going
to apologize to Europe

00:22.079 --> 00:24.480
'cause it's right up there
with the bubonic plague

00:24.481 --> 00:26.783
and the carpet bombing
at Dresden.

00:26.784 --> 00:29.687
Tommy, hi.
Amy. Yeah.

00:29.688 --> 00:31.556
Ignore Dan.
He's hormonal.

00:31.557 --> 00:33.725
The song is funny because

00:33.726 --> 00:35.527
it's the opposite
of her views on Europe.

00:35.528 --> 00:38.362
Drinks when I get back?
Okay.

00:38.363 --> 00:40.060
You need to do it like Mike.

00:40.061 --> 00:41.861
Yeah, I don't want
to be like Mike, okay?

00:41.862 --> 00:43.329
Even Mike doesn't want
to be like Mike.

00:43.330 --> 00:44.730
<i>You should call him.</i>

00:44.731 --> 00:46.896
And we need to keep the veep
away from regular people

00:46.897 --> 00:48.430
and their awkward questions.

00:48.431 --> 00:50.131
So while she's in Helsinki,
just keep her out of Helsinki.

00:50.132 --> 00:53.467
- Yeah, wonderful.
- She gave me a Leviathan with fewer pockets.

00:53.468 --> 00:57.599
So what's the latest?
Any burning effigies of me in the Balkans?

00:57.600 --> 01:00.859
- Look at you in your jammies.
- I need Ambien.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.360
Oh, right.

01:02.361 --> 01:04.894
What? This is Cipro.
I don't have a urinary infection.

01:04.896 --> 01:07.895
Oh, my gosh.

01:07.896 --> 01:09.694
<i>Listen to this.</i>

01:09.695 --> 01:12.594
The climate here is very cold,

01:12.595 --> 01:16.430
but the reception here
is very warm.

01:16.431 --> 01:18.598
- It's almost there.
- Yeah.

01:18.599 --> 01:20.499
<i>Isn't it great?</i>

01:20.500 --> 01:22.534
Yes, this is.
Yeah, well...

01:22.535 --> 01:23.767
- Gary.
- Yeah?

01:23.768 --> 01:25.434
Did you get my...?

01:25.435 --> 01:26.966
Please don't make that face.

01:26.967 --> 01:29.101
You know I only do this
when I go abroad. Come on.

01:29.102 --> 01:31.836
It's just last time you stopped,
you were so up and down.

01:31.837 --> 01:34.072
Listen, I really do need
my little soldiers.

01:34.073 --> 01:37.307
- I'm just saying...
- I need my flaming redheads.

01:37.308 --> 01:40.210
- I don't understand...
- Thank you.

01:40.211 --> 01:43.613
So what's going on?
How's the song going over in Finland?

01:43.614 --> 01:47.550
Some paper is calling you the
Europhobic Khaleesi from DC.

01:47.551 --> 01:48.984
Europhobic?
Seriously?

01:48.985 --> 01:51.620
What is that supposed to mean?
I'm scared of subtitles?

01:55.991 --> 01:57.291
<i>Mike, you got the summary</i>

01:57.292 --> 01:59.025
<i>of the 2008
swing state modeling?</i>

01:59.026 --> 02:02.562
Uh, not yet, but I do have a summary
of the summary that's great.

02:02.563 --> 02:04.997
So...

02:04.998 --> 02:06.732
Hey, Dan.

02:06.733 --> 02:09.801
- How's it hanging, Mike?
- It's fucking insane here.

02:09.803 --> 02:12.270
It's like a math prison.
They rape you with numbers.

02:12.271 --> 02:14.172
Mike, what's your
voter registration ETA?

02:14.173 --> 02:15.860
<i>Imminent...al.</i>

02:15.861 --> 02:17.615
All right, Mike, listen,
just tell me one thing.

02:17.616 --> 02:18.776
How do you do that Fozzie Bear,

02:18.777 --> 02:21.112
happy guy, wocka-wocka bullshit
to get the press to like you?

02:21.113 --> 02:23.181
Oh, you want to learn
to McLin-talk, huh?

02:23.182 --> 02:25.150
Remember it's a performance.

02:25.151 --> 02:26.951
<i>You have to pretend
that you're charming.</i>

02:26.952 --> 02:28.820
It doesn't matter if the jokes
are weak, keep it loose.

02:28.821 --> 02:32.389
Deliberately bad jokes.
It's kind of genius.

02:32.390 --> 02:34.158
Explains a lot.

02:35.093 --> 02:36.526
Call dickhead.

02:38.996 --> 02:41.664
<i>- West Wing, Jonah.
- Hey, Jonah. It's Mike.</i>

02:41.665 --> 02:44.300
I need you to come over here and
explain this Dream Metric to...

02:44.301 --> 02:46.268
oh, bingo.
I was looking for that.

02:46.269 --> 02:48.237
Okay, so you want J-Rock
to come down there

02:48.238 --> 02:50.973
and spit some wicked wisdom in your ear.
Is that what I'm hearing, Mike?

02:50.974 --> 02:55.078
Look, if you do this, I will get you
back in as the veep's resident creep.

02:55.079 --> 02:57.948
If I come down there, Mike, people are
gonna wonder why I'm not in Europe.

02:57.949 --> 03:00.751
Don't worry, buddy. I can cover for you.
Remember, I lie for a living.

03:00.752 --> 03:03.954
<i>Yeah, but you don't do it well
and nobody believes you.</i>

03:05.423 --> 03:08.559
I realize it's below freezing
here in Helsinki,

03:08.560 --> 03:10.461
but I certainly am touched

03:10.462 --> 03:13.731
by the very warm welcome
we've received this evening.

03:13.732 --> 03:17.335
<i>Thank you very much. Thank you.</i>

03:17.336 --> 03:19.370
<i>Do you have any
comment on the song?</i>

03:19.371 --> 03:20.571
<i>Madam Vice President,
would you have made</i>

03:20.572 --> 03:21.973
<i>jokes like that
about the Middle East?</i>

03:21.974 --> 03:23.875
Guys, we really appreciate
you coming out,

03:23.876 --> 03:26.944
- but let's save the autographs for tomorrow.
- Is she going to apologize?

03:26.945 --> 03:28.980
- The vice president is here...
- To apologize?

03:28.981 --> 03:30.114
You're a long way
from home, mate.

03:30.115 --> 03:31.516
This is really
the line of questioning...

03:31.517 --> 03:33.785
Mate? Yeah, you're a long
way from home, mate, too.

03:33.786 --> 03:36.455
The vice president is here
to sign a trade agreement

03:36.456 --> 03:39.758
and forge a very important friendship
between two great nations.

03:39.759 --> 03:41.694
Press avail tomorrow.

03:41.695 --> 03:45.264
At which point I'll perform a
little street magic for you, okay?

03:45.265 --> 03:46.732
So you guys
all think of a card.

03:46.733 --> 03:48.701
I'm thinking nine of hearts.

03:48.702 --> 03:50.702
I'm thinking joker.

03:51.837 --> 03:53.571
Ooh!

03:53.572 --> 03:56.341
That was cold and hostile.

03:56.342 --> 04:00.645
Sure we didn't overshoot and
land in Russia in the 1950s?

04:00.646 --> 04:02.847
- Yeah, what was with that British reporter?
- I know.

04:02.848 --> 04:05.183
You do not want
one of those on your back.

04:05.184 --> 04:08.119
They will sell nude pics of their
grandmothers for a glass of hot beer.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.787
By the way, that is not the way

04:09.788 --> 04:13.424
Mike would have handled that
back then at the airport, okay?

04:13.425 --> 04:15.326
If Mike were here, we would
have spent the entire flight

04:15.327 --> 04:17.161
watching him do scratcher
lotto tickets going,

04:17.163 --> 04:19.497
"Oh, so close,"
every time he lost.

04:19.498 --> 04:22.233
- Could we just...
- Yeah, I miss Mike.

04:22.234 --> 04:23.868
Oh, look.
That's nice.

04:23.869 --> 04:26.070
It's got a smiley face on it.

04:28.474 --> 04:32.444
Selina, you looking for
50 ways to leave Helsinki?

04:32.445 --> 04:34.045
Okay, guys,
thank you very much.

04:34.046 --> 04:35.513
We're not taking
any questions tonight.

04:35.514 --> 04:36.849
We've got some iPads
to recharge.

04:36.850 --> 04:38.551
But we'll see you in the morning.
Okay, thank you.

04:38.552 --> 04:40.955
- Good night.
- Just get in the Jeep, veep.

04:42.357 --> 04:44.559
Hey, relax, old-timer.
Cavalry's here.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.729
We have to summarize
all this for the layman.

04:46.730 --> 04:49.866
Jesus, Mike.
This is so basic.

04:49.867 --> 04:51.768
This is like high school
all over again.

04:51.769 --> 04:55.205
Holy shit, grandpa, you probably
still get your porn from magazines.

04:55.206 --> 04:57.613
<i>Mike, sub the data principles</i>

04:57.614 --> 05:01.785
to 500, 100,
and 20-word versions.

05:01.786 --> 05:03.287
- Jonah.
- Yes, sir?

05:03.288 --> 05:06.158
Well, this is
an unexpected permutation.

05:06.159 --> 05:08.897
- Mike?
- Hmm?

05:10.333 --> 05:13.335
Um, the vice president thought
Jonah's talents might be...

05:13.336 --> 05:16.806
We're supposed to inform
Congress of covert operations.

05:16.807 --> 05:19.242
<i>Now, this isn't a choice
like my diet,</i>

05:19.243 --> 05:21.111
this is a necessity
like my drinking.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.016
I am going to be taking soundings
over the next 24 hours.

05:24.017 --> 05:26.620
The national security
advisor is running around

05:26.621 --> 05:28.455
like he's got eagles
flying out of his dick.

05:28.456 --> 05:32.226
All this melodrama really
explains your three divorces.

05:32.227 --> 05:34.461
Well, I'd like to divorce your
head from your fucking neck.

05:34.462 --> 05:37.098
Do it. All right, listen,
Mike, I need you...

05:38.934 --> 05:40.768
How many lunch breaks
can one guy take?

05:40.769 --> 05:43.170
<i>So I just got
an e-mail from Sue.</i>

05:43.171 --> 05:45.039
Something's really got 'em
jumping at the White House.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.908
Okay, well, you need to go
and apologize for the song.

05:47.909 --> 05:50.511
And don't make
any jokes, okay, Dan?

05:50.512 --> 05:53.281
Because with your face, when
you attempt to be charming,

05:53.282 --> 05:56.050
it really does
come off as evil.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.753
- Yeah.
- You doing okay?

05:58.754 --> 06:02.057
- Did you get the...?
- Ooh, they got pears.

06:02.058 --> 06:04.459
I don't want fruit.
Did you get 'em?

06:04.460 --> 06:06.796
Yes, I got 'em.
I got 'em.

06:08.231 --> 06:11.300
- Oh, come on.
- It's a small bag.

06:11.301 --> 06:14.169
- Are you complaining about this gift?
- No, I'm not.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.905
It's not a small bag.
Your hands are large.

06:16.906 --> 06:19.608
- My dad always said I had lady's hands.
- Well...

06:19.609 --> 06:21.676
- I got 'em.
- Oh, goodie.

06:21.677 --> 06:24.313
- Right here.
- Yep. I feel so nasty.

06:29.185 --> 06:31.119
Wow.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.889
Don't give me that Quaker
in a titty bar look.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.858
Seriously, don't.

06:37.761 --> 06:39.762
<i>Here we go...
Ken's given Barbie the slip.</i>

06:39.763 --> 06:41.264
<i>Okay, guys,</i>

06:41.265 --> 06:44.066
to those who may have
misinterpreted the song,

06:44.067 --> 06:45.568
we, to them, offer apologies,

06:45.569 --> 06:48.104
especially our
most gracious host

06:48.105 --> 06:50.406
the Prime Minister of Finland.

06:50.407 --> 06:51.641
So what's going on back there?

06:51.642 --> 06:53.509
<i>All I know is
the Secretary of Defense</i>

06:53.510 --> 06:54.944
has been in to see Kent.

06:54.945 --> 06:56.645
<i>I must go to sleep now, Amy.</i>

06:56.646 --> 06:59.081
I'm on your time...
Helsinchronized.

06:59.082 --> 07:02.051
Yeah, well, I feel like I'm on
two time zones at the same time.

07:02.052 --> 07:04.119
I might be the first woman
ever to have parallel periods.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.689
You got to go to Europe,
Amy, and I'm in my bedroom.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.525
Sean, you need
to come to bed now.

07:09.526 --> 07:13.329
And lower your expectations.
We will just be sleeping.

07:13.330 --> 07:16.732
It's not a crisis.
Despite your standard-issue

07:16.733 --> 07:19.501
hysterical washerwoman
reaction, it's really not.

07:19.502 --> 07:21.437
Lives were at risk.
You know lives?

07:21.438 --> 07:23.606
Like what you had before they
made you king of the undead.

07:23.607 --> 07:27.477
Your idea of crisis management is
screaming, "We're fucked! Bury me!"

07:27.478 --> 07:29.712
We're fucked!
Bury me!

07:35.119 --> 07:38.054
<i>Okay, it's "Hyva Suomi."
That's "Go, Finland."</i>

07:38.055 --> 07:41.891
Okay, "Hyva Suomi." And is
the song thing shut down?

07:41.892 --> 07:43.593
Oh, yeah.
Bullet in the head, unmarked grave.

07:43.594 --> 07:45.462
Madam Vice President.

07:46.631 --> 07:48.098
Madam Prime Minister.

07:48.099 --> 07:50.300
I am delighted to
welcome you to Finland.

07:50.301 --> 07:52.603
Thank you.
And please call me Selina.

07:52.604 --> 07:55.138
- Selina.
- Yes?

07:55.139 --> 07:57.741
- Excuse me?
- What?

07:57.742 --> 08:00.444
- Shall we begin?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

08:00.445 --> 08:02.613
- Would you like to lead the way?
- Yes, yes.

08:02.614 --> 08:04.415
- Oh, you'd like to go first?
- Oh, we can...

08:04.416 --> 08:06.184
- We can go together? Yes?
- In tandem.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.919
- Yes? Yes?
- We shall go.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.854
I have a gift for you.

08:09.855 --> 08:14.091
We hope that when you come to our
country, you will go fishing.

08:14.092 --> 08:16.293
Because no one will feed me?

08:16.294 --> 08:18.995
Because you love fishing.

08:18.996 --> 08:21.597
I don't, actually.
How baffling.

08:21.598 --> 08:24.567
No, but it is still
a beautiful gift.

08:24.568 --> 08:26.969
I also have a gift for you

08:26.970 --> 08:29.505
of famous Finnish birds.

08:29.506 --> 08:31.641
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

08:31.642 --> 08:34.210
Oh, my.

08:34.211 --> 08:35.945
Oh, I have it.
I have it.

08:35.946 --> 08:37.813
Thank you.
What a lovely clock

08:37.813 --> 08:40.883
with an unusual bird.

08:40.884 --> 08:42.885
It's an Angry Bird.

08:42.885 --> 08:45.921
And why is it so angry?

08:45.922 --> 08:50.325
Because it wants to destroy
all of the pigs.

08:50.326 --> 08:53.662
Oh, of course.
It's an Angry Bird.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.397
It is an app.
It is a computer game.

08:55.398 --> 08:57.733
It is a successful
Finnish export

08:57.734 --> 09:01.036
that we give to you
to reflect Finland's place

09:01.037 --> 09:04.106
as a pioneer
of software innovation.

09:04.107 --> 09:05.774
Indeed.
I'm a huge fan.

09:05.775 --> 09:07.976
- You have played it?
- Yes. Yes.

09:09.178 --> 09:11.913
Although violence
in games is a concern.

09:11.914 --> 09:15.049
But in this case,
it's great fun

09:15.050 --> 09:17.551
to kill the pigs

09:17.552 --> 09:19.953
in a game, of course.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.001
- The inscription...
- Yes?

09:35.002 --> 09:37.837
Yes, it reads, "Finland,

09:37.838 --> 09:41.075
you are hefty."

09:41.076 --> 09:43.844
Uh-uh.
That is the wrong word.

09:43.845 --> 09:46.280
Oh. Yes,
it is ironic, no?

09:46.281 --> 09:51.085
Because Americans have a much greater
body mass index than the Finns.

09:51.086 --> 09:53.554
Ah, which is why I have
recently launched

09:53.555 --> 09:55.824
my Get Moving campaign,

09:55.825 --> 09:59.961
which is aimed
specifically at the obese

09:59.962 --> 10:03.065
and the morbidly obese.

10:05.067 --> 10:07.468
Why do you hate
numbers so much?

10:07.469 --> 10:11.139
Oh, God, you weren't molested
by your math teacher, were you?

10:11.140 --> 10:13.208
Let's go in here. Oh.

10:13.209 --> 10:15.243
- Hey, Mike.
- Uh...

10:17.847 --> 10:19.815
- Hi, Kent.
- We have a problem, Mike.

10:19.816 --> 10:22.017
I'm gonna get you
the stat summary ASAP, sir.

10:22.018 --> 10:23.518
I am a Metric Dreamweaver.

10:23.519 --> 10:25.587
This is not
a Dream Metric issue.

10:25.588 --> 10:27.689
Are you familiar
with the Eye of Sauron?

10:27.690 --> 10:30.058
Fire-rimmed,
all-seeing eye

10:30.059 --> 10:31.860
from Tolkien's
"Lord of the Rings."

10:31.861 --> 10:34.129
I think I caught it
on a plane once.

10:34.130 --> 10:37.832
The Eye of Sauron is the near perfect
analogue for the modern media.

10:37.833 --> 10:40.301
If we can draw the Eye
to Helsinki,

10:40.302 --> 10:43.170
then it won't be looking
at what's going on here.

10:43.171 --> 10:45.973
And what is exactly
going on here?

10:45.974 --> 10:47.841
I cannot tell you that, Mike.

10:47.842 --> 10:49.209
Is Selina Gollum?

10:49.210 --> 10:52.179
No, no, no.
Enough of that ear swill.

10:52.180 --> 10:55.082
Is what's going on what I
think is going on, Kent?

10:55.083 --> 10:56.517
Are you working
as a hatcheck girl now?

10:56.518 --> 10:58.952
Oh, great.
Did you see that?

10:58.953 --> 11:00.621
The Attorney fucking General.

11:00.622 --> 11:04.325
Look, we all know that the
lie is worse than the crime.

11:04.326 --> 11:06.093
Look, you're nodding your head,

11:06.094 --> 11:07.895
but you don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

11:07.896 --> 11:10.731
- The song, it's...
- Close your ears, Mike.

11:10.732 --> 11:14.034
One of the hostages
in Uzbekistan was a spy.

11:14.035 --> 11:17.972
Now, some people knew and didn't
bother to inform Congress.

11:17.973 --> 11:20.308
Other people, like Selina,
did not know.

11:20.309 --> 11:23.044
She went on record denying
that there was a spy.

11:23.045 --> 11:25.213
So for the next 13 months,

11:25.214 --> 11:27.281
we're gonna play
who knew what when.

11:27.282 --> 11:29.817
Then some of us are gonna
go off on the lecture circuit

11:29.818 --> 11:32.353
and some of us
are gonna go off to prison.

11:32.354 --> 11:34.689
Now you can shake your head.

11:34.690 --> 11:36.991
Christ, I hate knowledge.

11:36.992 --> 11:39.961
May I introduce,
please, my husband?

11:39.962 --> 11:41.529
Osmo Hakkinen.

11:41.530 --> 11:43.565
How do you do?

11:43.566 --> 11:46.134
Oh!
How lovely.

11:46.135 --> 11:48.704
That hasn't happened
in Washington since 1835.

11:48.705 --> 11:50.472
It is a pleasure to meet you.

11:50.473 --> 11:53.508
Although I'm a little bit
disappointed you've not serenaded us.

11:53.509 --> 11:54.910
Ah, the song.

11:54.911 --> 11:57.546
Well, I hope you realize that
that was entirely in jest.

11:57.547 --> 12:00.315
Yes. In fact, it is
the presumption of offense

12:00.316 --> 12:01.950
that has offended me.

12:01.951 --> 12:04.553
Oh, well, no offense
was intended.

12:04.554 --> 12:08.155
But your communications director
apologized specifically to me.

12:08.156 --> 12:11.860
This gives the impression that I am somehow
humorless or petty. I am "neider."

12:11.861 --> 12:13.862
- She is "neider."
- No, she's "neider."

12:13.863 --> 12:16.398
Would you please excuse us
for just one moment?

12:16.399 --> 12:19.101
- Yes?
- For a moment, yeah.

12:21.371 --> 12:23.239
So that song,
unlike your career

12:23.240 --> 12:26.142
as communications
director, will not die.

12:26.143 --> 12:29.879
So now you must go and
apologize for the apology.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.750
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why are you still standing right here?

12:33.751 --> 12:36.019
Oh, here he comes. Virgin Atlantic.

12:36.020 --> 12:39.389
Okay, guys, I want to apologize

12:39.390 --> 12:43.293
for suggesting that
the prime minister

12:43.294 --> 12:46.329
may have been somehow personally
offended by the song, okay?

12:46.330 --> 12:47.864
That's on me.
That's my bad.

12:47.865 --> 12:50.834
Are you gonna be apologizing for
this in about an hour or so?

12:50.835 --> 12:53.436
- Sorry?
- Blimey, that was quick.

12:53.437 --> 12:55.572
Thank you.

12:57.675 --> 12:59.743
We should keep
this causing offense

12:59.744 --> 13:02.346
- and then apology cycle going.
- Oh.

13:02.347 --> 13:05.816
You could step on my dress.
I could sneeze in your drink.

13:05.817 --> 13:07.384
- It's funny.
- It is funny.

13:07.385 --> 13:09.020
I could say you have
a weird-shaped head.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.621
Which of course you don't.

13:10.622 --> 13:13.958
You have an ideal head,
Madam Prime Minister.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.529
But I'm very relieved that you
have a sense of humor about it.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.998
Oh, the Finns are famous
for their sense of humor.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.368
- Oh.
- Do you know the work of Aki Kaurismaki?

13:23.369 --> 13:25.504
- Oh, the tennis player?
- No.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.440
No. I'm joking.
I'm joking now.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.878
In fact, we in America are also
famous for our sense of humor.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.712
Yes.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.382
But seriously, I'm so
pleased about the agreement

13:36.383 --> 13:38.084
that we were able
to sign today.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.019
Ah, Danteeksi.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.956
<i>Anteeksi... in Finnish
it means I'm sorry.</i>

13:42.957 --> 13:45.458
But the press
have added "Da"...

13:45.459 --> 13:46.859
- "D"...
- Oh, no.

13:46.860 --> 13:50.029
To make Danteeksi.
Do you get it?

13:50.030 --> 13:52.898
- Very amusing.
- You know the Finns are known

13:52.899 --> 13:55.200
- for their sense of humor.
- Clearly, yeah.

13:55.201 --> 13:58.936
Danteeksi, I need to
apologize to you in advance

13:58.937 --> 14:01.672
because I think that
this is going to be.

14:01.673 --> 14:03.942
"The Never Ending Sorry."

14:03.943 --> 14:07.245
Yes!

14:07.246 --> 14:08.813
As opposed to "story."

14:08.814 --> 14:10.281
- Yes.
- Yes.

14:11.917 --> 14:14.085
It's a wonderful country.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.657
<i>Good evening.</i>

14:19.658 --> 14:22.393
Office of the Vice President.
It's 2:00 P.M., Sue.

14:22.394 --> 14:24.529
Are you on antipsychotics
or in Helsinki?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.798
<i>I need you to engorge
the VP's schedule.</i>

14:26.799 --> 14:28.566
I want her charming
the Helsinki people.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.112
You want me to pad
the veep's schedule?

14:31.113 --> 14:32.181
<i>Why, sir?</i>

14:32.182 --> 14:34.706
POTUS wants hands shaken
and old women grinned at.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.109
<i>Please accept the necessity
of this as brute fact.</i>

14:38.679 --> 14:41.347
Ever since we got here, all
I've been doing is apologizing.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.249
Okay? I've been apologizing
for cancelling events,

14:43.250 --> 14:44.751
then apologizing
for putting them back on.

14:44.752 --> 14:46.253
Then apologizing
for apologizing.

14:46.254 --> 14:47.921
I mean, I'm a fucking
laughingstock.

14:47.922 --> 14:49.957
If you burst into tears,
stay away from this dress.

14:49.958 --> 14:52.359
Mike.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.227
Amy, remember how we said

14:54.228 --> 14:56.329
that none of
the students was a spy

14:56.330 --> 14:58.631
because if one of them was a
spy, it would have endangered

14:58.632 --> 15:00.900
the lives of the other three
who were not spies?

15:00.901 --> 15:02.602
Turns out one of them
was a spy.

15:02.603 --> 15:05.004
- Everything okay?
- Hey, Danteeksi.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.706
<i>Amy? Hello?</i>

15:06.707 --> 15:08.307
<i>- You still there?
- Fucking prick.</i>

15:08.308 --> 15:11.844
Um, the president told
the veep that was bullshit

15:11.845 --> 15:14.113
and she is on record
saying that's bullshit.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.981
Just keep her away
from the press.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.949
She's already on lockdown
'cause of the song.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.651
Shall I put her
in an iron mask?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.586
Yeah, great idea.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.954
Would you be offended

15:22.955 --> 15:25.423
if I just had a quick word
with the finance minister?

15:25.424 --> 15:26.658
Oh, no, not at all.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.827
Minna.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.262
Your wife is so lovely.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.997
Yes, I'm quite a fortunate man.

15:32.998 --> 15:35.265
Well, you are.
What a lovely thing to say.

15:35.266 --> 15:36.767
I'm dying for a smoke.

15:36.768 --> 15:38.602
Oh, yeah.
Boy, tell me about it.

15:38.603 --> 15:40.771
I could use a cigarette myself.
Mm, mm, mm.

15:40.772 --> 15:44.107
- I don't suppose that you...
- Yes, that would be wonderful.

15:44.108 --> 15:46.343
This is my bag man Gary Walsh.

15:46.344 --> 15:48.178
This is the prime
minister's husband.

15:48.179 --> 15:50.514
Osmo Hakki...enenen.

15:50.515 --> 15:54.218
<i>I believe in Finland
bag man is kassi.</i>

15:54.219 --> 15:55.920
Yes.

15:55.921 --> 15:57.722
Well, I'll see you outside.

15:57.723 --> 15:59.457
Yes, yes.
Thank you very much.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.226
- Ooh, that impressed him.
- Yeah.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.328
Okay, this is cigarette
number six for you.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.564
Okay, you need to calm
the fuck down, Judge Judy.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.067
I've been negotiating
my ass off all day.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.768
And it's number five,
by the way.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.303
I just want to avoid
an incident.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.972
The Finns are very antismoking.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.374
Cool it, kassi.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.578
Mm.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.014
- That's a relief.
- Yes.

16:23.015 --> 16:26.016
I think it's just wonderful
how supportive you are

16:26.017 --> 16:28.318
of Minna's career,
her job, you know?

16:28.319 --> 16:31.588
Oh, well, it's only the
Prime Minister of Finland.

16:31.589 --> 16:33.824
Less power than
the Mayor of Cleveland.

16:35.326 --> 16:37.895
Your Secret Service look
about as tough as mine.

16:37.896 --> 16:41.298
Shall we get them to fight?

16:41.299 --> 16:43.234
Although, seeing as these
cigarettes are the thing

16:43.235 --> 16:44.802
that's most likely
going to kill me,

16:44.803 --> 16:47.138
I'm surprised
that my Secret S...

16:50.342 --> 16:52.777
Jesus.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.815
Hey. Hey, I got you
some breath fresheners.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.717
I got you some Altoids
and I got you some gum.

16:59.718 --> 17:02.120
Gary, my boob.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.521
What?

17:03.522 --> 17:05.924
- He grabbed it.
- What?

17:05.925 --> 17:09.894
I'm the Vice President of the
United States of America.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.931
He just squeezed my tit
like a balloon.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.499
- Mm-mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.137
Okay, I'm gonna go mess him up.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.205
- Just let me know.
- Selina.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.676
Are you quite feeling all right?
You're very pale.

17:24.678 --> 17:26.979
Perhaps you should go to the
courtyard, get some fresh air.

17:26.980 --> 17:29.315
- No, thank you.
- No?

17:29.316 --> 17:30.716
No.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.452
This is Erkki.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.322
He is our head
of economic development.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.891
Yes, he has only two anecdotes.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.326
Neither of them
is worth hearing.

17:40.327 --> 17:43.862
Hey, ma'am, I just got a
text from the White House.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.564
- Ah.
- Nothing bad, I hope.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.035
Just a major violation
of a border.

17:49.036 --> 17:50.570
You get this in a text?

17:50.571 --> 17:52.071
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.706
The only text I get
is from my husband

17:53.707 --> 17:55.942
saying I am being
late home again.

17:55.943 --> 17:58.911
- Might want to...
- Yeah.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.646
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.181
- Just breathe.
- Oh, my God.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.316
- Did you see?
- Oh, my God. How could you not?

18:04.317 --> 18:06.351
- Did you see this?
- Yes. Yes.

18:06.352 --> 18:09.754
I'm gonna get you some water.
He looks like a Disney villain.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.293
Jesus, Gary.
You look leukemic.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.861
I always do.
That's my look.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.329
Yeah, well, you are
rocking that look

18:18.330 --> 18:20.231
pretty hard tonight, my friend.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.632
Quite a night.

18:21.633 --> 18:24.669
Oh...
I'll fucking say.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.437
Did Gary just text you?

18:26.438 --> 18:28.540
- Gary knows?
- Yeah.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.442
Jesus, Mike's gone viral.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.976
Mike?

18:31.977 --> 18:33.645
We're talking about...

18:33.646 --> 18:35.646
- POTUS lying about the spy.
- Osmo groped me.

18:35.647 --> 18:36.848
- What?
- What?

18:36.849 --> 18:39.117
- He what?
- He fucking what?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.619
- Did you tell her?
- He... he...

18:40.620 --> 18:42.954
he told me those rumors
weren't true.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.089
Can you believe that monster?

18:45.090 --> 18:47.524
- Wait, wait, wait. What happened?
- What did you say?

18:47.525 --> 18:48.959
- POTUS.
- He groped her.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.794
- POTUS groped you?
- No.

18:50.795 --> 18:52.362
POTUS wouldn't have
the balls to grope me.

18:52.363 --> 18:54.431
He knew and he lied?

18:54.432 --> 18:56.366
Wait, wait, knew what?
Lied about what?

18:56.367 --> 18:58.902
POTUS knew that
the student was a spy

18:58.903 --> 19:01.405
and didn't inform the
Congressional Intel Committee.

19:01.406 --> 19:04.108
- Shit! Shit!
- What were you talking about?

19:04.109 --> 19:07.045
Osmo groped me.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.212
Shit!

19:08.213 --> 19:10.481
We need to rain down
the full might

19:10.482 --> 19:12.483
of our nuclear arsenal
on Finland.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.319
Mm-hmm.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.521
That's the other thing
I forgot to tell you.

19:16.522 --> 19:19.191
We're gonna blow up Finland.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.026
Can I help you?
Where the fuck you been?

19:21.027 --> 19:22.861
<i>Don't tell me.
You've been polling.</i>

19:22.862 --> 19:25.798
I bet when you take a crap, it
actually comes out as a number two.

19:25.799 --> 19:28.401
Listen, we've got
to tell the president

19:28.402 --> 19:30.370
that he has to admit
that this student was a spy.

19:30.371 --> 19:33.206
I'm still collating whether
admitting is the best course.

19:33.207 --> 19:35.642
I can't believe you're still
checking the fucking wind direction.

19:35.643 --> 19:39.012
I need more time before the
truth can emerge in such a...

19:39.013 --> 19:40.705
Congressman Furlong.

19:40.706 --> 19:42.575
Yeah, the blank looks
are not gonna play here.

19:42.576 --> 19:44.718
You two have been caught with
your balls in grandma's mouth.

19:44.719 --> 19:46.320
Everybody's talking
about it up on the Hill.

19:46.321 --> 19:47.922
I know what I know.

19:47.923 --> 19:50.591
I don't know what
you think you know.

19:50.592 --> 19:53.394
Screw you and your Confucius
grasshopper bullshit, all right?

19:53.395 --> 19:56.597
Everybody's gonna know.
That's just the way these things go.

19:56.598 --> 19:59.767
Now people think POTUS lied
about that kid being a spy.

19:59.768 --> 20:03.470
I want to know what you two spunk
junkies propose we do about it.

20:03.471 --> 20:06.406
Sorry, Kent, I just had
a quick question about...

20:06.407 --> 20:09.176
Oh, do they know?
Laurel and Retardy?

20:09.177 --> 20:11.845
Tell you what, Mike.
I need you to add these summaries

20:11.846 --> 20:15.615
to the rollout overview.
Okay? Go.

20:15.616 --> 20:17.684
- Oh, round two.
- Well...

20:17.685 --> 20:19.486
- Senator Doyle.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

20:19.487 --> 20:22.322
Well, I hope I get
my five free punches.

20:22.323 --> 20:24.925
I'm the fucking chair
of Senate Intel,

20:24.926 --> 20:28.728
which means that I'm supposed to
be informed of any covert action.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.663
We're all on the same
team here, right?

20:30.664 --> 20:33.699
Right, Team Fuckup. Yeah, I got my
membership card here somewhere.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.435
- I can't find it.
- You need to look at the bigger picture.

20:35.436 --> 20:36.936
Oh, I've seen
the bigger picture.

20:36.937 --> 20:39.072
Shows POTUS lying
to the American people.

20:39.073 --> 20:41.408
I'm telling you,
this is not just a crisis.

20:41.409 --> 20:45.278
This is at least 10 years
of Oliver Stone movies.

20:45.279 --> 20:47.046
Yeah, not the good ones.
Not "Platoon."

20:47.047 --> 20:49.848
<i>What the fuck is
wrong with you, Kent?</i>

20:49.849 --> 20:53.486
Seriously, when you pulled the pin out,
you're supposed to throw the grenade away.

20:53.487 --> 20:55.688
You don't stick it up
your own freakin' ass.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.623
That I'd like to see.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.325
- I need a cigarette.
- Oh, God.

20:59.326 --> 21:02.361
No, not "Oh, God." Just get
me the goddamn cigarette.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.131
The president,
the one I support,

21:05.132 --> 21:07.834
the one that I am loyal to

21:07.835 --> 21:10.302
as my job, lies to me.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.038
<i>- Right?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

21:12.039 --> 21:15.208
Okay, after I apologized
for apologizing,

21:15.209 --> 21:18.377
I started to put meet-the-people
events back in your schedule.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.479
Cancel them all
and apologize for cancelling.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.548
Oh, Jesus, more apologizing?
Really?

21:22.549 --> 21:25.885
I apologized less after I
banged my brother's fiancée.

21:25.886 --> 21:27.853
What are you bitching about?
Are you kidding?

21:27.854 --> 21:31.023
I'm the one who's under pressure.
Get it together, lady.

21:31.024 --> 21:34.526
What about the grope?
I mean, come on.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.629
- Thank you.
- That is an attack on America.

21:37.630 --> 21:41.666
All right? That's like a
sexual 9/11 in my opinion.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.269
Or a sexual Cuban
Missile Crisis at the least.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.672
It's not like we can
go public about the grope.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.573
- It would define you.
- Right.

21:49.574 --> 21:51.475
Your tit being
fondled by a Finn

21:51.476 --> 21:53.010
would be all
you're remembered for.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.513
- Yeah.
- You can't build a statue on that.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.850
That's right.
Nobody can know about this.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.453
- All right? Especially Kent.
- Oh, yeah.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.556
And why is that?
Because he's gonna use it against me.

22:03.557 --> 22:05.258
- A grope matrix.
- Right.

22:05.259 --> 22:08.495
Because he's a man.

22:08.496 --> 22:12.566
Because this is a man's
world that we live in.

22:13.935 --> 22:17.738
Because of the axis of dick.

22:29.384 --> 22:31.886
This fish is delicious.

22:31.887 --> 22:34.355
- What is this fish?
- It is chicken.

22:34.356 --> 22:36.424
- The breast?
- Yes.

22:36.425 --> 22:40.962
In America we actually
call fish chicken of the sea.

22:40.963 --> 22:42.931
I love fish.

22:42.932 --> 22:44.900
Some men do not like the taste.

22:44.901 --> 22:47.503
I do.

22:49.439 --> 22:51.774
Thank you.
Oh, Madam Prime Minister,

22:51.775 --> 22:54.911
I don't believe I've had a chance
to introduce you to Gary Walsh.

22:54.912 --> 22:57.080
No. No, you have not.

22:57.081 --> 22:58.614
I'm the VP's bag man,

22:58.615 --> 23:01.317
which I believe
in Finland you say kassi.

23:01.318 --> 23:04.987
- Excuse me?
- I'm a kassi.

23:08.292 --> 23:10.693
Where did you get
this translation from?

23:10.694 --> 23:13.529
I have a Finnish friend in
DC who works at the embassy

23:13.530 --> 23:16.066
and she gave me lessons
before I came.

23:16.067 --> 23:18.668
You see, kassi is bag,

23:18.669 --> 23:21.738
but it's not bag man.

23:21.739 --> 23:24.441
It is a man bag.
You know, rrr.

23:24.442 --> 23:26.176
It is a container.

23:26.177 --> 23:28.711
It is a testicle container.

23:30.014 --> 23:32.816
Oh, no.
Don't feel ashamed, Gary.

23:32.817 --> 23:35.452
Because, of course,
you're not a ball sack.

23:35.453 --> 23:37.554
And not everyone can
say that they're not...

23:37.555 --> 23:39.456
excuse me, I'm so sorry...

23:39.457 --> 23:41.091
a ball sack.

23:41.092 --> 23:44.194
Not even everyone
at this very table.

23:45.396 --> 23:47.964
Kent wants me to add
these regional summaries

23:47.965 --> 23:50.367
from the thumb drive.
All right, how do you add?

23:50.368 --> 23:51.968
Command A, hombre.

23:51.969 --> 23:53.603
I always thought
it was control A.

23:53.604 --> 23:56.739
Okay, here we go.
Send.

23:57.741 --> 23:59.608
Shit, maybe it was control A.

23:59.609 --> 24:01.677
I think you might have
selected all

24:01.678 --> 24:03.646
and sent everything that
was on that thumb drive.

24:03.647 --> 24:05.914
- That's what you told me to do.
- No, I didn't.

24:05.915 --> 24:08.050
- You said command A.
- No, I said control A.

24:08.051 --> 24:10.386
You just couldn't hear me because
you didn't have your ear trumpet.

24:12.789 --> 24:14.524
I feel like I want to burn this thing.
Can I burn this computer?

24:14.525 --> 24:16.626
Why would you burn that, Mike?

24:18.763 --> 24:20.965
Mike?
Excuse me.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.935
What's up?

24:23.936 --> 24:26.971
We just sent out Kent's polling
consultation on the spy.

24:26.972 --> 24:28.172
What spy?

24:28.173 --> 24:30.208
One of the hostages was a spy.

24:31.543 --> 24:33.411
Oh, fuck you, Mike.

24:33.412 --> 24:35.680
You're career poison.
Do you know that?

24:35.681 --> 24:38.649
Jesus, that's why you like sailing,
because you're a fucking anchor

24:38.650 --> 24:41.485
dragging promising careers down to
the bottom of the fucking ocean.

24:41.486 --> 24:44.122
Stop it.
This was just phase one stuff.

24:44.123 --> 24:46.157
Sample questions like,
"What if the president lied?"

24:46.158 --> 24:48.226
But not that.
That sounds bad.

24:48.227 --> 24:51.128
It was more coded,
which still is bad.

24:51.129 --> 24:53.664
Yeah.

24:53.665 --> 24:55.666
I mean, it would have
gotten out anyway, right?

24:55.667 --> 24:57.735
- Um...
- This is the Internet age.

24:57.736 --> 25:00.337
- Nothing stays a secret.
- Yeah, yeah, and it's DC.

25:00.338 --> 25:01.939
It's DC.
Everybody here talks.

25:01.940 --> 25:04.441
Yeah, look, all we got
to do is stay calm.

25:04.442 --> 25:06.744
- We just got to stay calm.
- Keep walking, avoid any...

25:06.745 --> 25:10.014
It doesn't work like that.
Mike, hold up.

25:10.015 --> 25:12.950
If you'd see the way I framed the
question, you'd understand that.

25:12.951 --> 25:14.952
Well, tell that to Oprah
when you mount your comeback.

25:14.953 --> 25:17.821
I mean, you sent it to me and every
second bozo in the building.

25:17.822 --> 25:20.224
- No, I didn't.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

25:20.225 --> 25:22.760
Look, you marked it
highly confidential,

25:22.761 --> 25:25.996
thereby guaranteeing that
this thing is gonna go viral.

25:25.997 --> 25:29.766
Uh, the vice president was groped by
the Finnish prime minister's husband.

25:29.767 --> 25:32.403
What? Why are you
telling me that?

25:32.404 --> 25:34.772
- That's just weird.
- Yeah, that's really unfortunate.

25:34.773 --> 25:36.741
Was that up in the hills
or down in the valley?

25:36.742 --> 25:39.611
Sir, I was thinking the
Eye of Sauron, you know?

25:39.612 --> 25:42.047
Keep the focus on Helsinki.

25:42.048 --> 25:43.582
Sailing.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.984
Well, congratulations, Kent.

25:44.985 --> 25:46.852
You just brought down
this presidency.

25:48.655 --> 25:51.758
Well, the weather here
in Helsinki has been...

25:51.759 --> 25:53.159
hellishly cold.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.661
Kent's polling data
got e-mailed.

25:55.662 --> 25:57.496
POTUS's spy lie
just went public.

25:57.497 --> 26:00.566
Okay, we're pulling out.
Let's go, shortest Q&A ever.

26:00.567 --> 26:03.902
Danteeksi!
Danteeksi!

26:03.903 --> 26:05.837
Guys, okay, we've got
some weather to contend with,

26:05.838 --> 26:07.605
so we only have time
for three questions.

26:07.606 --> 26:09.007
You will be hearing from me.

26:09.008 --> 26:10.876
- Yes? Yes?
- Yes. Yes.

26:10.877 --> 26:12.711
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye. Oh!

26:12.712 --> 26:13.991
Two more questions.

26:13.992 --> 26:16.214
Was the visit about the agreement
or the song?

26:16.215 --> 26:17.982
We are very pleased
about the agreement

26:17.983 --> 26:19.718
and we are agreed on that.

26:19.719 --> 26:21.820
And that was actually two questions,
so I'm afraid we've got to go.

26:21.821 --> 26:24.155
Where I come from,
we kill people

26:24.156 --> 26:25.790
for looking at us funny.

26:25.791 --> 26:29.394
We waterboard folks who
haven't even done anything.

26:29.395 --> 26:31.328
And you raped my tit.

26:31.329 --> 26:33.931
- Oh...
- Oh, yeah, you did.

26:33.932 --> 26:35.866
<i>So I'm coming for you</i>

26:35.867 --> 26:38.635
'cause I'm an Angry Bird
right now...

26:39.904 --> 26:41.304
and you're a pig.

26:41.305 --> 26:43.172
<i>- Selina! Selina!
- Thank you.</i>

26:43.173 --> 26:45.708
<i>Are you going to
apologize for the spy?</i>

26:45.709 --> 26:49.244
Did the president know that
one of the hostages was CIA?

26:49.245 --> 26:51.580
- Did you know?
- I stand with the president.

26:56.285 --> 26:58.920
I stand with the president?

26:58.921 --> 27:00.555
Why did I say that?

27:00.556 --> 27:02.290
Can we pretend
you didn't say it?

27:02.291 --> 27:03.658
What will people think I mean?

27:03.659 --> 27:05.861
That you stand
with the president.

27:05.862 --> 27:08.097
I mean, there's not a ton
of ambiguity with that one.

27:08.098 --> 27:11.300
Well, who knew that being
sexually assaulted

27:11.301 --> 27:14.403
wouldn't be the worst thing
to happen in my day, huh?

27:14.404 --> 27:16.238
That's something
for the memoirs.

27:16.239 --> 27:17.339
I am never going back there.

27:17.340 --> 27:18.841
<i>- Yeah.
- Danteeksi?</i>

27:18.842 --> 27:20.843
I'm sorry.
Sorry I ever set foot

27:20.844 --> 27:23.646
in that fucking fish-eating,
indie film fucking hellhole.

27:23.647 --> 27:25.147
Oh, come on.
Get over it.

27:25.148 --> 27:27.116
I told everybody
I was a scrotum.

27:27.117 --> 27:28.952
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

27:28.953 --> 27:31.354
- It's okay.
- Did you hear that?

27:31.355 --> 27:34.691
- He's not.
- Ma'am, are you okay?

27:34.692 --> 27:38.628
I don't know.
I guess so. Sure.

27:38.629 --> 27:40.530
No.

27:40.531 --> 27:42.866
I mean, would it be so hard

27:42.867 --> 27:44.601
for people not to be assholes?

27:44.602 --> 27:47.537
I wouldn't know.

27:49.174 --> 27:51.308
Why are you coughing, ma'am?

27:54.546 --> 27:57.414
Because I caught a cold.

27:57.415 --> 27:59.817
Oh, look, I just found out
who that British reporter is.

27:59.818 --> 28:02.653
The creepy guy. He was like a
noisy fucking ghost, really.

28:02.654 --> 28:04.255
What's his name?
I'll Google him.

28:04.256 --> 28:06.891
- Dave Wickford.
- Dave Wickford.

28:06.892 --> 28:10.327
Yeah, it says
divorced twice, no kids.

28:10.328 --> 28:12.363
57 Twitter followers.

28:12.364 --> 28:14.098
That's shit for a journalist.
Yeah.

28:14.099 --> 28:16.200
Europe used to be
my favorite continent.

28:16.201 --> 28:19.503
Now it's not even in my top five.
