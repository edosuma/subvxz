03:48.359 --> 03:51.642
Bravo! Bravo!

03:54.479 --> 03:57.579
I don't understand. Is the
conductor a blithering idiot?

03:57.679 --> 03:59.739
We went over the tempo six times!

03:59.839 --> 04:02.899
It's adagio, adagio, adagio.
It's not racehorse tempo!

04:02.999 --> 04:06.259
- Ja, ja, Herr Crawford. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- What? Don't be sorry!

04:06.359 --> 04:09.939
Get it right. What good are apologies
when the poetry of the moment is lost?

04:10.039 --> 04:12.259
And you! You're supposed to knock
when you're ready in the trunk.

04:12.359 --> 04:13.539
How do I know when you're all clear?

04:13.639 --> 04:15.179
I'm sorry, Mr. Crawford,
I couldn't breathe in that...

04:15.279 --> 04:18.339
- Well, you're not hired to breathe!
- But it was her first time, Mr. Crawford.

04:18.439 --> 04:21.539
My God, we went over this
routine all afternoon.

04:21.639 --> 04:23.459
How do I know when to begin
sticking in the swords?

04:23.559 --> 04:27.059
I could have stabbed you to death,
and then, I get blood on my ensemble.

04:27.159 --> 04:29.099
Mr. Wei Ling Soo!
You were, as always, brilliant!

04:29.199 --> 04:30.619
I've already taken off my robe.

04:30.719 --> 04:33.179
- Can my wife and I take a photo of you?
- An autograph, please?

04:33.279 --> 04:37.019
- Autographs are for mental defectives.
- But I want to prove I met you.

04:37.119 --> 04:39.259
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd rather that proof didn't exist.

04:39.359 --> 04:41.880
What if you get picked up for sodomy?

04:48.719 --> 04:50.059
Yes!

04:50.159 --> 04:52.019
Stanley?

04:52.119 --> 04:54.659
Burkan! How are you, Howard?

04:54.759 --> 04:57.939
Brilliant. You are still
the best in the world.

04:58.039 --> 05:00.579
No thanks to the assorted
Neanderthals I have to deal with.

05:00.679 --> 05:01.739
You haven't changed.

05:01.839 --> 05:05.939
You're still a perfectionist, a snob, a genius,
with all the charm of a typhus epidemic.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.179
Well, can I help it if I'm
surrounded by assassins?

05:09.279 --> 05:12.219
Nonetheless, you held us spellbound.

05:12.319 --> 05:15.179
And that last effect, from the
sarcophagus into the empty chair,

05:15.279 --> 05:16.819
when you swivel around...

05:16.919 --> 05:20.139
I mean, I do a vanish-and-reappearance
trick in my show

05:20.239 --> 05:21.779
where I transport my pretty assistant

05:21.879 --> 05:24.459
from one side of the stage to
the other in a steamer trunk,

05:24.559 --> 05:27.046
but it is nothing
compared to what you do.

05:27.519 --> 05:29.579
I invented that effect myself.

05:29.679 --> 05:30.939
And if you're very good,

05:31.039 --> 05:32.699
when we have more time,
I'll teach you all the moves.

05:32.799 --> 05:35.739
It's actually... It's very simple.
You can do it anywhere.

05:35.839 --> 05:37.379
It's a spectacular trick.

05:37.479 --> 05:39.659
It's so good to see you.
How long has it been?

05:39.759 --> 05:42.379
It's a year, at least.
And the tour's going well?

05:42.479 --> 05:45.179
Yes, it's going quite well.
It concludes this week.

05:45.279 --> 05:47.979
Munich was good. Barcelona adored me.

05:48.079 --> 05:50.659
And you'll never guess who came
to see the show in Zurich.

05:50.759 --> 05:52.979
- Enid Paxton.
- Enid Paxton?

05:53.079 --> 05:54.219
Little thing in third form,

05:54.319 --> 05:57.419
we both used her as an assistant
when we decided to become magicians.

05:57.519 --> 05:59.339
You sawed her in half,
and I cut her head off.

05:59.439 --> 06:01.299
Well, she was a game girl.

06:01.399 --> 06:03.179
- How is she?
- She's fine.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.779
You don't really notice any of the scars.
Of course, she's fatter than my elephant.

06:06.879 --> 06:09.099
What? Pretty little
Enid with the curls?

06:09.199 --> 06:10.899
Well, the years can be cruel, Howard.

06:10.999 --> 06:14.779
"Life is nasty, brutish and short,"
as the man said.

06:14.879 --> 06:18.139
Was it Hobbes? Yes, I believe it was Hobbes.
I'd have got on rather well with Hobbes.

06:18.239 --> 06:19.499
Shall we go for a drink?

06:19.599 --> 06:21.539
Brilliant notion, Burkan.
We can catch up.

06:21.639 --> 06:24.779
Stanley, I need your help.

06:24.879 --> 06:28.526
The plot thickens.
I'll buy you a scotch.

06:56.999 --> 07:02.379
The Catledge family are wonderful people.
Caroline Catledge is an old friend of mine.

07:02.479 --> 07:06.659
They're a wealthy Pittsburgh family.
Father made millions in coal before he died.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.819
They're socialites with several houses,
one in the south of France.

07:10.919 --> 07:14.899
Now, the thing is, there's a
young woman staying with them,

07:14.999 --> 07:18.419
who has them believing
that she's a spirit medium.

07:18.519 --> 07:22.379
Lord, not another fake psychic.
What a pestilence they are.

07:22.479 --> 07:24.939
They're taken with her
predictions of the future.

07:25.039 --> 07:27.459
- Telling them what they want to hear.
- Precisely.

07:27.559 --> 07:30.699
And charging them for all
the good news she brings.

07:30.799 --> 07:33.099
Exactly right. And, of course,
she's a pretty young thing.

07:33.199 --> 07:35.699
Well, of course. A pretty face
never hurt a cheap swindler.

07:35.799 --> 07:41.099
Brice Catledge, Caroline's brother,
the heir to the family fortune,

07:41.199 --> 07:43.619
fancies himself in love with her.

07:43.719 --> 07:46.539
I don't know who I loathe more,

07:46.639 --> 07:49.219
those who use simple tricks
to prey on the gullible,

07:49.319 --> 07:52.419
or the gullible, who are so stupid,
they deserve what they get.

07:52.519 --> 07:56.699
Brice Catledge's sister Caroline is
married to a doctor, a psychoanalyst,

07:56.799 --> 07:59.659
and he insisted on this
woman doing her séances,

07:59.759 --> 08:03.419
- in the presence of two renowned scientists.
- Rubbish.

08:03.519 --> 08:06.059
Doesn't he know that scientists
are among the easiest to fool?

08:06.159 --> 08:08.299
Well, this is the thing,
I'm embarrassed to say,

08:08.399 --> 08:12.099
that I watched this woman work
from every angle, time and again,

08:12.199 --> 08:14.819
and I couldn't find anything amiss.

08:14.919 --> 08:16.979
I mean, I watched every move,
and Lord knows,

08:17.079 --> 08:20.299
I know pretty much every mind-reading
and séance trick there is,

08:20.399 --> 08:25.219
but I couldn't find a flaw or
spot a single suspicious move,

08:25.319 --> 08:27.459
and I began to doubt
my own clear thinking.

08:27.559 --> 08:31.002
You know, I thought,
"Maybe, she's the real thing."

08:31.439 --> 08:35.379
There is no real thing, Howard!
It's all phony!

08:35.479 --> 08:38.379
From the séance table,
to the Vatican and beyond!

08:38.479 --> 08:39.979
I can't believe you're saying this.

08:40.078 --> 08:41.739
I'm very worried for the family.

08:41.839 --> 08:44.539
If you could come and
observe her in action?

08:44.639 --> 08:48.739
After all, you are the greatest debunker
of fake spiritualists in the world.

08:48.839 --> 08:51.499
There's not a single one
who's got past you.

08:51.599 --> 08:54.939
Olivia and I were all set to take a
holiday, travel through the Galapagos.

08:55.039 --> 08:56.259
But you hate holidays.

08:56.359 --> 08:59.499
You'll spend your whole time in
your room practicing card tricks,

08:59.599 --> 09:01.579
and you'll never see the big turtles.

09:01.679 --> 09:04.659
And besides, you've always
loved the south of France,

09:04.759 --> 09:07.179
and you could visit
your Aunt Vanessa.

09:07.279 --> 09:11.379
But if this woman knows she's being
watched by the great Wei Ling Soo,

09:11.479 --> 09:13.899
she'll make some
excuse not to perform.

09:13.999 --> 09:17.059
The usual headaches,
resistance in the room...

09:17.159 --> 09:18.339
She'll never know
you're Wei Ling Soo.

09:18.439 --> 09:20.979
No one knows who you are
under all that chinoiserie.

09:21.079 --> 09:23.019
You can pose as anyone you like.

09:23.119 --> 09:27.379
Well, if she's fooled you,
she must be very good.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.619
But she won't fool me.

09:29.719 --> 09:32.379
I can't wait to see what
gimmickry she's employing,

09:32.479 --> 09:36.047
unmask it, and throw
it back in her face.

09:38.799 --> 09:40.419
Postponing our holiday?

09:40.519 --> 09:43.579
- I can't resist.
- You're driven, Stanley.

09:43.679 --> 09:46.325
Don't get angry with me, Olivia.
It won't be for long.

09:46.559 --> 09:48.739
Okay, go.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.859
You've always had the
measure of me, Olivia.

09:50.959 --> 09:53.099
Ever since our very first dinner,

09:53.199 --> 09:55.579
when I made your ruby ring
disappear from your finger,

09:55.679 --> 09:58.579
and reappear in your soft-boiled egg.

09:58.679 --> 10:01.099
If you recall, I quickly
figured out how you did it.

10:01.199 --> 10:02.859
Yes, you were very impressive.

10:02.959 --> 10:05.739
It was simply a matter of
logic and common sense.

10:05.839 --> 10:09.739
I mean, you palmed the ring and
distracted me by spilling the salt.

10:09.839 --> 10:12.659
I believe it was my clear thinking
that attracted you to me.

10:12.759 --> 10:14.779
Yes, your logic and
common sense equal mine,

10:14.879 --> 10:17.219
but you have the added
quality of being beautiful.

10:17.319 --> 10:21.569
You've said it several times, Stanley.
We're a match made in heaven.

10:50.559 --> 10:52.819
What a serendipitous pleasure

10:52.919 --> 10:57.979
to be surprised by my favorite
nephew and Howard Burkan!

10:58.079 --> 10:59.299
Little Howard.

10:59.399 --> 11:02.459
- "Burkan the Great," if you please.
- Of course.

11:02.559 --> 11:05.619
Of all my nephews and nieces,
you're the only one, Stanley,

11:05.719 --> 11:07.659
who isn't boring to the
point of perfection.

11:07.759 --> 11:09.699
I couldn't agree more.

11:09.799 --> 11:13.659
If only you had a slightly milder disposition,
you might actually have friends.

11:13.759 --> 11:16.139
I am his friend.
Notice I use the singular.

11:16.239 --> 11:17.779
Yes, he means he can tolerate me.

11:17.879 --> 11:19.779
You may be Burkan the
Great to your public,

11:19.879 --> 11:22.939
but to me, you'll always
be little Howard Burkan,

11:23.039 --> 11:26.819
who took my favorite scarf,
cut it in half with a pair of scissors,

11:26.919 --> 11:31.099
waved his magic wand over it,
and it didn't come back together.

11:31.199 --> 11:34.179
- I was just learning the trick.
- No, she never got over that.

11:34.279 --> 11:36.699
And to what do I owe
this unannounced visit?

11:36.799 --> 11:39.699
I'm here to expose yet another
fraudulent spiritualist,

11:39.799 --> 11:42.179
and I thought I'd warn you I'll
be dropping by for black pudding.

11:42.279 --> 11:45.979
Yes, the Catledges are holding
séances up at their place.

11:46.079 --> 11:49.699
They've apparently met some gifted medium.
It's the talk of the Côte d'Azur.

11:49.799 --> 11:53.379
She's a little American called Sophie Baker,
and apparently she's very sharp,

11:53.479 --> 11:54.859
but Stanley will get
the measure of her.

11:54.959 --> 11:56.729
I can't wait.

12:09.319 --> 12:10.899
- Welcome!
- Welcome...

12:10.999 --> 12:12.659
- How lovely to see you.
- Bienvenue.

12:12.759 --> 12:15.059
- George, Caroline, Stanley.
- How do you do?

12:15.159 --> 12:17.179
- Hello.
- Stanley. A great pleasure.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.379
- George.
- Charmed.

12:18.479 --> 12:21.299
Of course, George and Caroline
are the reason I'm here.

12:21.399 --> 12:24.899
They're a great deal less gullible
than Caroline's mother and brother,

12:24.999 --> 12:28.339
and had hoped that I would be able
to reveal the medium as a fraud.

12:28.439 --> 12:30.819
When she fooled Howard Burkan,
we knew we were in trouble.

12:30.919 --> 12:33.579
But then when he said he was
best friends with Wei Ling Soo...

12:33.679 --> 12:36.219
We're great admirers. Who isn't?

12:36.319 --> 12:39.259
I don't know if Howard told you,
her name is Sophie Baker.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.579
Have you heard of her or...

12:40.679 --> 12:44.419
No, I have not, but these sleazy
fraudsters change identity every month.

12:44.519 --> 12:47.739
And I omitted to mention
she's here with her mother.

12:47.839 --> 12:49.659
- Now, that says a lot.
- Yeah.

12:49.759 --> 12:52.099
I hope you kept your eyes on
her mother during the séance,

12:52.199 --> 12:53.939
or did she dim the lights too low?

12:54.039 --> 12:55.259
Caroline, you were next to her.

12:55.359 --> 12:58.499
She held my brother's hand,
and she actually made the table rise.

12:58.599 --> 13:00.499
Well, I looked for the
usual devices, of course.

13:00.599 --> 13:03.139
I thought maybe, wrist lifts,
but they weren't there.

13:03.239 --> 13:07.179
She's promised to try and make contact
with my father, who died a year ago.

13:07.279 --> 13:09.099
As I was saying,
your mother and your brother

13:09.199 --> 13:12.979
are the victims of a dishonest ruse,
as your good sense tells you.

13:13.079 --> 13:15.419
There is, of course, no spirit world,
and even if there were,

13:15.519 --> 13:18.299
you can be sure that some little
American gypsy would not be the one

13:18.399 --> 13:20.459
blessed to unlock its secrets.

13:20.559 --> 13:22.739
Only a low-grade halfwit
would fall for any of this.

13:22.839 --> 13:26.219
But you're not implying that her
mother and brother are halfwits?

13:26.319 --> 13:29.219
Well, I haven't met them yet.
But I'm sure they're like most people,

13:29.319 --> 13:31.419
desperate for a little hope
in a world that has none,

13:31.519 --> 13:32.979
and willing to believe anything.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.939
Who shall we say you are?

13:35.039 --> 13:38.379
Introduce me as Stanley Taplinger.

13:38.479 --> 13:40.499
I'm an old friend in the
import-export business.

13:40.599 --> 13:42.619
Understood. Mr. Taplinger,
up to the house.

13:42.719 --> 13:44.979
Come on, Howard.

13:45.079 --> 13:46.939
What is that dreadful noise?

13:47.039 --> 13:50.659
My brother. He practices
serenading Sophie.

13:50.759 --> 13:53.139
Both thine eyes are cute, too

13:53.239 --> 13:56.010
What they do to me

13:57.199 --> 13:58.579
Hear me holler

13:58.679 --> 14:01.019
I choose a sweet lollapaloosa

14:01.119 --> 14:03.779
In thee

14:03.879 --> 14:07.499
Thou sweet, thou grand...

14:07.599 --> 14:09.979
- Howard.
- Brice, good to see you again.

14:10.079 --> 14:13.819
Can I introduce you to my friend Stanley
Taplinger, who's going to be staying.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.099
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Taplinger...

14:16.199 --> 14:17.219
- Taplinger... Taplinger.
- Taplinger.

14:17.319 --> 14:19.459
And, how long will you being
staying with us, Mister...

14:19.559 --> 14:21.579
Not very. I have business elsewhere.

14:21.679 --> 14:23.259
Have you told him about Sophie?

14:23.359 --> 14:25.819
Now, is this the girl that
can read minds and such?

14:25.919 --> 14:29.099
- Well, she gets these sensory impressions.
- And, what are they?

14:29.199 --> 14:32.579
It's hard to explain.
She gets these mental vibrations.

14:32.679 --> 14:34.899
Her head vibrates?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.579
- Drink?
- Thank you.

14:36.679 --> 14:38.847
- Have you got a whiskey, Brice?
- I absolutely do.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.659
Now, Sophie looked into my eyes

14:41.759 --> 14:44.339
and told me things about me
she could never have known.

14:44.439 --> 14:47.979
About old girlfriends I'd had,
and places I've traveled to.

14:48.079 --> 14:49.619
Good heavens. You think
she can do it with me?

14:49.719 --> 14:51.779
Of course. Of course.

14:51.879 --> 14:57.379
Whatever questions you have about life,
the hereafter... Here, cheers.

14:57.479 --> 15:01.059
Perhaps there's a departed loved
one you wish to make contact with.

15:01.159 --> 15:04.139
Sophie sees all. She can predict
the future. In short, she's a visionary.

15:04.239 --> 15:06.539
And, I'm told she's very
pleasant to look at.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.459
She's a visionary and a vision.

15:08.559 --> 15:13.219
Mother's agreed to subsidize a foundation
for the serious scientific study of her work.

15:13.319 --> 15:16.059
Well, after this buildup,
I'm champing at the bit to meet her.

15:16.159 --> 15:18.219
She's doing some psychic readings
over at the Lounsberrys' house,

15:18.319 --> 15:19.739
but she should be here any minute.

15:19.839 --> 15:21.459
And the Lounsberrys, I take it,
are wealthy marks...

15:21.559 --> 15:24.859
Wealthy friends of yours that
she was anxious to meet?

15:24.959 --> 15:27.419
Yes. How did you know?

15:27.519 --> 15:29.299
Mental vibrations.

15:29.399 --> 15:34.619
Excuse me? Telephone call, Mr. Catledge.
Your business office in Paris.

15:34.719 --> 15:36.728
Excuse me.

15:37.399 --> 15:43.259
He doesn't make any business decision
at all now without consulting Sophie first.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.859
Well, what can I say, Howard?
He's a moron.

15:45.959 --> 15:47.779
Incidentally, Stanley, I think,

15:47.879 --> 15:51.379
if you could bottle up your
sarcasm a little more skillfully,

15:51.479 --> 15:52.819
it might help us on our mission.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.499
Howard, we all hope someone will
come along with superpowers,

15:55.599 --> 16:00.088
but the only superpower certain
to show up wears a black robe.

16:01.559 --> 16:05.739
Speak of the devil and superpowers,
I think that's her now.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.167
Yeah, there she is.

16:20.559 --> 16:21.899
- Mr. Talmudge.
- Hello.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.099
- Taplinger.
- Hello.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.459
I'm so sorry. Yes.

16:24.559 --> 16:26.619
You're every bit as lovely
as you've been described.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.444
Thank you.

16:30.319 --> 16:32.009
Wait.

16:36.399 --> 16:41.605
Don't say anything.
I'm getting a mental impression.

16:42.119 --> 16:46.379
Are you from the Orient?
The Far East?

16:46.479 --> 16:48.339
China?

16:48.439 --> 16:52.259
Have you been there, or do you visit?

16:52.359 --> 16:54.561
Why do you say China?

16:54.919 --> 16:57.619
I just get that impression.

16:57.719 --> 17:00.650
And what impression is that?

17:01.079 --> 17:02.326
No.

17:04.839 --> 17:07.166
Never mind. It's fading, it's fading.

17:07.279 --> 17:09.138
And you are her sister?

17:09.239 --> 17:11.779
- Mother.
- Mother, are you?

17:11.878 --> 17:16.378
What lovely cheek bones. The apple
does not fall far from the tree.

17:16.479 --> 17:18.539
And what do you do, Mr. Taplinger?

17:18.638 --> 17:19.979
- I'm...
- Wait.

17:20.079 --> 17:25.699
Sophie, what impression do you have
of Mr. Taplinger's line of work?

17:25.799 --> 17:29.242
- I should say Sophie has psychic gifts.
- Has she?

17:31.199 --> 17:34.699
It's not immediately clear,
although I...

17:34.799 --> 17:41.359
I do get some vibrations suggesting
that Mr. Taplinger travels a lot.

17:41.599 --> 17:43.059
Well, those are excellent vibrations,

17:43.159 --> 17:44.899
but it's not an unreasonable
assumption, is it?

17:44.999 --> 17:46.899
I mean, plenty of people
travel in their work.

17:46.999 --> 17:51.682
I see Germany.
Have you been to Germany?

17:53.479 --> 17:56.419
Matter of fact, I did have some
business recently in Berlin.

17:56.519 --> 17:58.739
I'd say, that's pretty
damn impressive.

17:58.839 --> 18:02.299
Mr. Burkan, as you
may know, is a magician,

18:02.399 --> 18:05.859
who was brought here to observe
my daughter and find flaws,

18:05.959 --> 18:08.019
but has stayed to marvel at her.

18:08.119 --> 18:10.019
Well, what have I stumbled upon?

18:10.119 --> 18:12.059
You never told us what
you did, Mr. Taplinger.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.088
Neither did your daughter.

18:18.199 --> 18:23.883
For some reason, my mental
impressions are cloudy.

18:24.199 --> 18:27.539
Cloudy. When you say your
mental impressions are cloudy,

18:27.639 --> 18:30.779
are they cumulus clouds or cirrus?

18:30.879 --> 18:33.419
Mr. Taplinger is a businessman.

18:33.519 --> 18:35.059
What line of business?

18:35.159 --> 18:37.043
The import-export trade.

18:37.359 --> 18:41.769
I see Chinese letters.

18:42.879 --> 18:44.524
Chinese writing.

18:44.719 --> 18:46.967
Perhaps, you're visualizing
my laundry ticket.

18:49.079 --> 18:50.459
You're making fun of me.

18:50.559 --> 18:52.299
I'm afraid you're in the
wrong part of the world.

18:52.399 --> 18:56.206
I import coffee beans
and cocoa from Brazil.

18:57.959 --> 19:00.459
Well, I didn't... Really?

19:00.559 --> 19:04.499
I think it's time we moved along.
Sophie's had a strenuous afternoon.

19:04.599 --> 19:08.619
It is rather exhausting communicating
with the unseen world.

19:08.719 --> 19:12.299
Well, I'm sure Mr. Taplinger doesn't
believe in the unseen world.

19:12.399 --> 19:14.139
On the contrary, I always
thought the unseen world

19:14.239 --> 19:16.328
was a good place to
open a restaurant.

19:16.679 --> 19:18.579
Time to go, Sophie.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.579
The spirits have to eat somewhere.

19:20.679 --> 19:24.219
Mr. Taplinger is rather obnoxious.

19:24.319 --> 19:28.649
Obnoxious, but he's not
entirely unappealing.

19:28.759 --> 19:30.019
Congratulations, Stanley,

19:30.119 --> 19:33.739
you've managed to alienate the entire
household in a single afternoon.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.659
She's nothing I haven't seen before.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.179
Pretty young thing with a stage
mother who handles the promotion,

19:38.279 --> 19:40.899
and who knows what else when
the lights are out at the séance.

19:40.999 --> 19:43.539
I want you to see her working.

19:43.639 --> 19:46.499
More importantly, I want to be
there when you expose them.

19:46.599 --> 19:48.259
Well, I mean, she's not
even a good actress.

19:48.359 --> 19:52.899
"I... I get the impression
of the Orient. China."

19:52.999 --> 19:54.539
What utter bilge.

19:54.639 --> 19:56.739
Well, I thought that was quite good,

19:56.839 --> 20:00.499
considering you are Wei Ling Soo
and you have just been to Germany.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.339
Yes, it's all very tantalizing.

20:02.439 --> 20:04.219
Careful, she's tricky.

20:04.319 --> 20:06.899
And yet, she's a fraud, Howard.

20:06.999 --> 20:10.619
Because there is no sixth sense.
There are five senses, and no spirit world.

20:10.719 --> 20:14.179
But there are coincidences.
Maybe she's made some lucky guesses,

20:14.279 --> 20:17.847
but we have to be careful not to
build them into something more.

20:18.399 --> 20:24.699
Your daughter is going to try to make contact
with my dear departed Harry tonight.

20:24.799 --> 20:26.699
Well, she's been waiting
for the right moment.

20:26.799 --> 20:29.419
Sophie needs the proper vibrations.

20:29.519 --> 20:34.579
Now, of course, we need to
purchase or build an establishment

20:34.679 --> 20:37.379
- suitable for the operation of our foundation.
- Of course.

20:37.479 --> 20:43.379
There will be various assorted costs, and
naturally, all the students will pay a fee.

20:43.479 --> 20:47.286
And, I assume, profits will
go into psychic research?

20:48.239 --> 20:50.299
Most of them.

20:50.399 --> 20:54.419
Minus operating
expenses and sundries.

20:54.519 --> 20:57.689
You can count on my support.

20:57.999 --> 21:01.819
I've always known there had to be
more to this life than meets the eye.

21:01.919 --> 21:05.659
How could it be that what we
see is all there is to everything?

21:05.759 --> 21:08.459
And, that's such a bleak thought.

21:08.559 --> 21:14.448
Why would God go to so much trouble
if everything comes to nothing?

21:15.519 --> 21:17.779
Well, Sophie is...

21:17.879 --> 21:22.979
Sophie is living proof that the
world is alive with hidden things.

21:23.079 --> 21:26.579
She's such an uplifting creature.

21:26.679 --> 21:30.725
No wonder my son, Brice,
is so smitten with her.

21:31.199 --> 21:34.499
I'm always chasing

21:34.599 --> 21:38.326
Rainbows

21:38.439 --> 21:41.219
Watching clouds

21:41.319 --> 21:44.841
Drifting by

21:45.919 --> 21:48.139
My schemes

21:48.239 --> 21:52.808
Are just like all my dreams

21:53.159 --> 21:59.321
Ending in the sky

22:00.639 --> 22:04.019
Some fellows look
and find the sunshine

22:04.119 --> 22:07.641
I always look and find the rain

22:08.119 --> 22:11.482
Some fellows make a killing sometime

22:11.639 --> 22:14.659
I never even make a gain

22:14.759 --> 22:16.739
Believe me

22:16.839 --> 22:20.499
I'm always chasing

22:20.599 --> 22:24.121
Rainbows

22:24.319 --> 22:29.047
Waiting to find a
little bluebird in vain

22:32.039 --> 22:33.819
You know that I'm in love with you?

22:33.919 --> 22:36.499
You mustn't give your
heart away so quickly.

22:36.599 --> 22:39.019
You looked into my eyes,
and without even knowing me,

22:39.119 --> 22:41.059
you knew me better
than I know myself.

22:41.159 --> 22:43.939
You knew my dreams and my ambitions.

22:44.039 --> 22:46.219
Please, don't tell me you're
in love with someone else.

22:46.319 --> 22:49.339
No, no, of course not.

22:49.439 --> 22:52.179
I never had time to fall in love.

22:52.279 --> 22:56.339
Mother and I were always
traveling, you know?

22:56.439 --> 22:58.939
Unlike you, we're members
of the working class.

22:59.039 --> 23:00.499
That's over.

23:00.599 --> 23:04.099
I'm gonna take care of you and pamper
you for the rest of your life.

23:04.199 --> 23:07.699
Do you like to travel?
I mean, on yachts?

23:07.799 --> 23:12.699
Do you like to go to parties and buy
jewels and clothes and go dancing?

23:12.799 --> 23:14.579
I'm a very good dancer.

23:14.679 --> 23:19.885
I'm sure I could get used
to yachts and jewels.

23:20.479 --> 23:23.819
I had an interesting chat with
Mr. Taplinger, as he's called.

23:23.919 --> 23:25.139
You did?

23:25.239 --> 23:29.539
Yeah, I'd say he has a classic
neurotic personality disorder.

23:29.639 --> 23:33.219
Yeah, brilliant parents
who didn't get along,

23:33.319 --> 23:37.259
closer to his aunt than his mother,
obsessed with mortality,

23:37.359 --> 23:41.579
believes in nothing,
finds life to have no meaning.

23:41.679 --> 23:45.579
Just a perfect depressive,
with everything sublimated into his art,

23:45.679 --> 23:48.419
and he is quite an artist.

23:48.519 --> 23:50.899
He began as an escape artist.

23:50.999 --> 23:54.899
Interesting choice if anyone ever
wanted to escape from reality.

23:54.999 --> 23:58.579
But, like Freud,
he will not permit himself

23:58.679 --> 24:03.739
to be seduced by childish thoughts
just because they're more comforting.

24:03.839 --> 24:06.929
Very unhappy man.

24:07.679 --> 24:10.769
I like him.

24:19.399 --> 24:21.419
- Miss Baker.
- Hello.

24:21.519 --> 24:23.179
Rested, I presume?

24:23.279 --> 24:25.939
Yes, I had a bath.
I had a little nap.

24:26.039 --> 24:28.499
And now, you're refreshed.

24:28.599 --> 24:32.459
Well, no, not entirely.
I had an unpleasant dream.

24:32.559 --> 24:34.859
I've had my share.

24:34.959 --> 24:39.139
I dreamt I was being followed
by a sinister Chinese.

24:39.239 --> 24:41.459
You have the Far East on the brain.

24:41.559 --> 24:44.239
- What do you think it means?
- I don't know.

24:45.559 --> 24:47.139
Good evening.

24:47.239 --> 24:49.459
I understand you're
holding a séance tonight.

24:49.559 --> 24:51.379
She's been waiting for
the right moment,

24:51.479 --> 24:54.899
and now, she says,
"The planets are in alignment."

24:54.999 --> 24:57.139
And what do they have
to be in alignment with?

24:57.239 --> 24:58.819
Your vertebrae?

24:58.919 --> 25:03.283
Can you do the séance if someone
in the room is a non-believer?

25:03.399 --> 25:09.139
And when you contact the spirits,
will we be able to see the souls?

25:09.239 --> 25:12.819
And how are they different from ghosts?
Or are they ghosts?

25:12.919 --> 25:15.259
I should think souls
are quite different.

25:15.359 --> 25:17.379
- Have you ever heard of ectoplasm?
- Ectoplasm?

25:17.479 --> 25:19.899
Now, isn't that a milky
substance rather like yogurt?

25:19.999 --> 25:22.019
You are a joker, aren't you?

25:22.119 --> 25:23.699
So, you're saying it
might look like yogurt,

25:23.799 --> 25:27.003
but it will be Mrs. Catledge's
former husband.

25:27.119 --> 25:30.859
Dinner. Sophie, come to dinner.

25:30.959 --> 25:33.699
Isn't the light perfect, Mother?

25:33.799 --> 25:37.339
Really, what exactly
happens at a séance?

25:37.439 --> 25:41.139
You know, I don't believe you're so
naive as you make out about the occult.

25:41.239 --> 25:43.779
I will admit, my Uncle Charles
once attended a séance

25:43.879 --> 25:46.219
where the medium made a lot
of amazing things happen,

25:46.319 --> 25:48.539
and weeks later, she was
unmasked and sent to prison,

25:48.639 --> 25:51.699
for defrauding people out of
substantial sums of money.

25:51.799 --> 25:55.640
Charles. Uncle Charles.

25:57.039 --> 25:59.339
Death by water.

25:59.439 --> 26:01.687
What did you say?

26:02.959 --> 26:06.049
What? I was just...

26:06.639 --> 26:10.525
I was receiving some
mental impressions. Excuse me.

26:11.559 --> 26:15.939
Come, Stanley, let's go to...
You look stunned.

26:16.039 --> 26:18.899
I had an uncle who
drowned many years ago.

26:18.999 --> 26:20.019
And when I mentioned him,

26:20.119 --> 26:24.539
she lapsed into a kind of fugue state
and muttered "Death by water."

26:24.639 --> 26:30.659
Well, she knew that my sister married
on March the seventh to a bank manager.

26:30.759 --> 26:32.979
There's absolutely no way she
could know that unless...

26:33.079 --> 26:35.379
Not you, too, Howard! No!

26:35.479 --> 26:39.400
I'll make short work of her
tonight during the séance.

26:41.839 --> 26:45.760
I would like us now to join hands,

26:47.239 --> 26:50.579
as we summon

26:50.679 --> 26:53.280
the unseen world.

26:55.119 --> 26:59.927
Now, we're here tonight
to contact the soul

27:00.599 --> 27:05.521
of the departed husband
of Grace Catledge,

27:06.239 --> 27:10.444
father of Brice and Caroline.

27:13.039 --> 27:17.244
Now, I will try to achieve

27:17.599 --> 27:20.245
a trance state.

27:27.719 --> 27:30.809
I'm falling deeper,

27:30.959 --> 27:33.844
and deeper,

27:35.159 --> 27:37.885
into a trance.

27:38.519 --> 27:42.485
Harry Catledge, give me a sign.

27:45.199 --> 27:47.925
Give us a sign!

27:50.999 --> 27:53.042
Harry?

27:53.959 --> 27:56.605
Is that you, Harry?

27:57.959 --> 27:59.939
Spirit?

28:00.039 --> 28:03.083
Signal us once for "Yes."

28:03.679 --> 28:06.979
Twice for "No."

28:07.079 --> 28:09.964
Harry, are you okay?

28:10.359 --> 28:12.960
Are you happy?

28:15.279 --> 28:19.768
Spirit, if you can hear me,

28:21.639 --> 28:24.410
give me a sign.

28:31.719 --> 28:34.206
That's not possible.

28:37.199 --> 28:39.699
I mean, damn it, Stanley,
we've both done levitations.

28:39.799 --> 28:43.579
I once raised a real tiger,
but we both have our tricks.

28:43.679 --> 28:47.299
There was nothing supporting
this candle, no threads, no wires,

28:47.399 --> 28:50.842
it was floating until
I brought it down.

28:51.999 --> 28:55.739
I was just telling
Mr. Pepperidge here

28:55.839 --> 29:01.059
how marvelously you made that candle
float with no apparent support.

29:01.159 --> 29:03.739
"Apparent," I think, is the key word.

29:03.839 --> 29:08.499
Is it "Pepperidge," or "Talmudge,"
or "Taplinger?"

29:08.599 --> 29:12.739
Anyway, it was a wonderful,
wonderful, super trick.

29:12.839 --> 29:17.659
I mean, I grabbed the candle and found
absolutely nothing supporting it.

29:17.759 --> 29:20.099
That's because there's
nothing to find.

29:20.199 --> 29:23.859
My daughter is not some
commercial music hall attraction.

29:23.959 --> 29:27.208
She doesn't do tricks.
She is an adept.

29:27.359 --> 29:29.819
I hope I didn't disappoint
you at your first séance.

29:29.919 --> 29:33.259
I found it nothing short of perfection.
Well done, madam.

29:33.359 --> 29:35.499
I can't even remember the last
time I've seen Mother so happy.

29:35.599 --> 29:36.659
Will you join us?

29:36.759 --> 29:38.379
We're all going to hear
some really hot music.

29:38.479 --> 29:39.539
Hot music?

29:39.639 --> 29:40.899
- Come on, Sophie, come on.
- Yeah, we...

29:40.999 --> 29:43.419
I thought you said "All this
mental work was exhausting?"

29:43.519 --> 29:46.739
It is, but I love hot music.

29:46.839 --> 29:51.299
Well, I hope you're not plagued tonight
by the dream of the sinister Chinese.

29:51.399 --> 29:54.459
You know, I figured out
who you represented.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.459
- Really?
- Yes.

29:56.559 --> 30:01.539
When I was much younger, years ago,
I went and saw Wei Ling Soo.

30:01.639 --> 30:02.739
Have you heard of him?

30:02.839 --> 30:06.379
He's a Caucasian who disguised
himself as a Chinese,

30:06.479 --> 30:09.459
and he billed himself as
the Great Oriental Wizard.

30:09.559 --> 30:12.339
I see, and did you
enjoy his performance?

30:12.439 --> 30:16.139
I did, very much. He was brilliant.

30:16.239 --> 30:19.419
He vanished a live elephant,
and it was just...

30:19.519 --> 30:22.299
I mean, it just was
completely shocking,

30:22.399 --> 30:26.259
but of course, it was mechanical tricks
that one could learn with enough practice.

30:26.359 --> 30:28.619
I see. And, your performance?

30:28.719 --> 30:31.539
- I wouldn't call it a performance.
- Well, call it what you will.

30:31.639 --> 30:36.179
I mean, it's a type of trickery,
like card magic or vanishing an elephant.

30:36.279 --> 30:39.449
And I say you're Mr. Wei Ling Soo.

30:39.599 --> 30:43.619
And I say there is nothing you
can do that I cannot duplicate.

30:43.719 --> 30:47.179
I don't doubt it. You're great.

30:47.279 --> 30:50.619
But just because you can
duplicate my miracles,

30:50.719 --> 30:54.719
in no way proves that
mine are not real.

31:06.639 --> 31:11.219
It was quite a display.
I must say, she impresses me.

31:11.319 --> 31:15.259
- And you saw no signs of trickery?
- Not yet.

31:15.359 --> 31:18.379
Well, let's face it, Stanley,
you came to unmask her,

31:18.479 --> 31:20.619
and she's unmasked you.

31:20.719 --> 31:24.499
On the one side, yes, she's pulling
off these bewildering feats,

31:24.599 --> 31:28.259
and on the other remains the simple
fact that what she's claiming to do,

31:28.359 --> 31:32.219
while exquisitely executed,
is simply not possible.

31:32.319 --> 31:34.379
But who's to say what's possible?

31:34.479 --> 31:39.619
I'm a physician, and new facts come to light,
new discoveries are made all the time.

31:39.719 --> 31:42.499
Things we never dreamed possible.

31:42.599 --> 31:44.339
To cure someone of blindness

31:44.439 --> 31:47.539
by having her lie on a couch
and talk about her childhood.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.019
I mean, who'd have thought?

31:49.119 --> 31:52.139
Yeah, but don't you see it challenges
our whole concept of reality?

31:52.239 --> 31:57.459
I mean, if there's an unseen world,
an afterlife, souls to contact,

31:57.559 --> 31:59.259
mind reading,
oretelling the future...

31:59.359 --> 32:02.579
Yes, it changes everything we've
held to be scientifically accurate.

32:02.679 --> 32:03.619
It's true.

32:03.719 --> 32:05.579
If what she claims was possible,

32:05.679 --> 32:08.379
everything would surely
take on new meaning.

32:08.479 --> 32:11.459
And yes, very hopeful meaning.

32:11.559 --> 32:13.979
To think, if there
were more to life...

32:14.079 --> 32:15.739
More what?

32:15.839 --> 32:19.459
That life doesn't end with death?
That the universe works by design?

32:19.559 --> 32:21.099
That God exists.

32:21.199 --> 32:26.819
All right, let's not get carried away.
The woman is a charlatan.

32:26.919 --> 32:29.419
Because, depressing as the
facts of existence are,

32:29.519 --> 32:31.859
they are the facts.

32:31.959 --> 32:33.859
There is no metaphysical world.

32:33.959 --> 32:37.419
What you see out
there is what you get.

32:37.519 --> 32:41.690
I think Mr. Nietzsche has disposed of
the God matter rather convincingly.

33:49.279 --> 33:50.819
Good morning.

33:50.919 --> 33:52.499
May I?

33:52.599 --> 33:54.899
Did you sleep well, Mr. Taplinger?

33:54.999 --> 33:58.139
Or should I just call you
by your Chinese name?

33:58.239 --> 34:01.045
You are a very clever
little humbug, Miss Baker.

34:03.119 --> 34:04.859
What are you doing today?

34:04.959 --> 34:07.979
I'm going bird-watching with Brice.
Do you want to join us?

34:08.079 --> 34:09.699
I can't think of a
more inane activity,

34:09.799 --> 34:14.163
watching little winged creatures acting
out nature's pointless busywork.

34:14.998 --> 34:17.259
Why don't you join me instead?

34:17.359 --> 34:18.699
Where?

34:18.799 --> 34:21.018
I'm driving to Provence
to visit my Aunt Vanessa.

34:21.119 --> 34:23.219
She's a remarkable woman.

34:23.319 --> 34:26.259
We could have lunch. Chat?

34:26.359 --> 34:28.458
Actually, get to know
one another better.

34:28.559 --> 34:33.978
You think you'll trick me into
showing you how I deceive people.

34:34.079 --> 34:35.299
Come on.

34:35.399 --> 34:40.366
I'm sure Brice Catledge can live without
drooling all over you for a few hours.

34:44.079 --> 34:48.967
I think I'd like to visit Provence.
I've never been there.

34:59.079 --> 35:00.819
Tell me, doesn't it ever
trouble your conscience

35:00.919 --> 35:04.019
to fool that poor,
empty-headed Mrs. Catledge

35:04.119 --> 35:07.699
into believing she's communicating
with her departed spouse?

35:07.799 --> 35:11.659
I could just as easily ask you, doesn't
it ever bother you to creep around,

35:11.759 --> 35:14.019
dashing people's dreams and hopes?

35:14.119 --> 35:15.259
Not if their hopes are false.

35:15.359 --> 35:18.259
Even if their hopes are false,
if it helps them get through life?

35:18.359 --> 35:19.970
Then you admit you're a fraud?

35:20.359 --> 35:24.339
I wonder if you get your
cynicism from your grandfather,

35:24.439 --> 35:28.689
the merchant seaman
with the missing finger.

35:31.119 --> 35:34.243
The missing toe.

35:38.079 --> 35:40.327
Why are you staring at me?

35:40.719 --> 35:42.379
Where are you from?

35:42.479 --> 35:44.443
Kalamazoo.

35:45.399 --> 35:50.082
It's in Michigan. And,
you're from London.

35:51.639 --> 35:54.160
I see a white house in Belgravia.

35:55.919 --> 35:58.899
Fourteen... No, 16.

35:58.999 --> 36:01.486
Wilton Crescent.

36:02.839 --> 36:05.059
A piano.

36:05.159 --> 36:08.283
Yes, that's all correct
and rather amazing.

36:08.639 --> 36:10.139
But I don't buy it.

36:10.239 --> 36:13.339
'Cause I'm a rational man who
believes in a rational world.

36:13.439 --> 36:15.801
Any other way, lies madness.

36:16.919 --> 36:19.219
You'd be happier if I was a fraud,

36:19.319 --> 36:22.779
because then, your whole fixed
worldview wouldn't be shaken up.

36:22.879 --> 36:24.619
No, it's quite the opposite.

36:24.719 --> 36:28.019
If you knew how much I don't
want you to be a fake...

36:28.119 --> 36:31.419
But think how embarrassing
it would be for you.

36:31.519 --> 36:36.299
Your whole life, you spent publicly
crusading against spiritualism,

36:36.399 --> 36:40.659
and then, you'd have to come out
with it and say that you were wrong.

36:40.759 --> 36:42.802
But I'm not wrong.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.600
Is that why Jenny dropped you?

36:47.439 --> 36:50.139
How could you know about Jenny?

36:50.239 --> 36:53.363
I see long, blonde hair.

36:54.319 --> 36:56.328
A wonderful laugh.

36:58.079 --> 37:00.885
Yes, she had a lovely laugh.

37:01.679 --> 37:03.819
But who wants a pessimistic bore

37:03.919 --> 37:08.647
who hides in his room all day
and practices card tricks?

37:11.039 --> 37:14.539
No, I'll tell you who wants a man who locks
himself in his room and practices all day,

37:14.639 --> 37:18.480
who's a committed artist.
Olivia, my fiancée.

37:20.319 --> 37:21.566
Yes.

37:22.199 --> 37:23.924
Olivia.

37:25.719 --> 37:28.650
I see a match made in heaven.

37:50.479 --> 37:53.179
How can you eat so much?
We just finished lunch.

37:53.279 --> 37:55.619
I told you I like to eat a lot.

37:55.719 --> 37:57.979
George's psychoanalyst says
it's because I need love,

37:58.079 --> 38:00.600
but to me, I'm just hungry.

38:01.679 --> 38:06.579
I mean, a lot of people need love,
but they don't eat their way to it.

38:06.679 --> 38:09.739
- You want some?
- No, thank you.

38:09.839 --> 38:11.939
This is so beautiful.

38:12.039 --> 38:14.241
It's transient.

38:15.559 --> 38:18.819
Stanley, how nice of you to drop by.

38:18.919 --> 38:22.168
And you, I take it, must be Olivia.

38:22.319 --> 38:24.779
Olivia? No, no.

38:24.879 --> 38:27.739
Olivia is a brunette.

38:27.839 --> 38:33.019
And she's a bit taller than me,
and she's in London,

38:33.119 --> 38:37.059
anxious to get on with her trip,
so, she can get to work on her book.

38:37.159 --> 38:38.419
I'm Sophie.

38:38.519 --> 38:42.059
You must be the American the
Catledges say is so amazing.

38:42.159 --> 38:45.299
Sophie fancies herself a telepathic,
among other things,

38:45.399 --> 38:50.059
so, be careful what you think, Aunt Vanessa.
We all know the evil workings of your mind.

38:50.159 --> 38:54.499
Stanley doesn't believe in spiritualists.
He thinks you're all scoundrels.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.299
If so, you're a very
pretty little scoundrel.

38:56.399 --> 39:00.445
If you see all and know all,
where's my aunt just been?

39:01.599 --> 39:04.405
Somewhere for her health.

39:05.879 --> 39:08.859
I see baths.

39:08.959 --> 39:12.819
Is it sciatica or rheumatism?

39:12.919 --> 39:16.739
It's sciatica, and that
is quite remarkable.

39:16.839 --> 39:19.659
How can you know that I've just
come back from a spa in Italy?

39:19.759 --> 39:21.979
However she knows, it's not
through mystical vibrations,

39:22.079 --> 39:23.059
I can assure you.

39:23.159 --> 39:28.099
He's always been so militantly
scientific, even at six years old.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.859
One of the most kind
and gentle local priests

39:30.959 --> 39:34.859
said that Stanley was the only child
in the neighborhood destined for Hell.

39:34.959 --> 39:36.379
And why do you still trek to Italy,

39:36.479 --> 39:38.699
to pay good money to
bathe in plain spring water

39:38.799 --> 39:42.539
that is not a drop more medicinal than
the water that flows from your own tub?

39:42.639 --> 39:45.299
I'm not going to get into that
debate with you, Stanley.

39:45.399 --> 39:46.819
It brings out the beast in you.

39:46.919 --> 39:49.499
And I see you still buy
this stupid nostrum.

39:49.599 --> 39:54.419
It's a health mixture. Sulfur,
molasses and barley extract.

39:54.519 --> 39:58.899
It's disgusting and is of no proven value.
Perhaps if I needed an emetic.

39:58.999 --> 40:01.099
Am I the only sane person
left on this planet?

40:01.199 --> 40:04.219
I love him, but he was always
an incorrigible child.

40:04.319 --> 40:05.499
Can I give you something?

40:05.599 --> 40:07.539
No, thank you. Just a
little wine, if you have any.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.059
- We've just eaten.
- Are those little cakes?

40:10.159 --> 40:12.739
Good heavens, are you seriously
going to have more food?

40:12.839 --> 40:15.059
- They're delicious.
- Unbelievable!

40:15.159 --> 40:18.179
Now, tell me something about my
Aunt Vanessa's colorful past.

40:18.279 --> 40:21.939
Leave her alone, Stanley.
She's not a performing monkey.

40:22.039 --> 40:24.299
Do you have a telephone I could use?

40:24.399 --> 40:27.139
I'm sorry, it's 3:00, and I was
supposed to meet Brice for drinks,

40:27.239 --> 40:28.339
but I'm never gonna make it.

40:28.439 --> 40:31.299
Brice Catledge is the young
milksop who's smitten with her,

40:31.399 --> 40:35.259
and ready to lay his family fortune at
her feet to subsidize her chicanery.

40:35.359 --> 40:37.299
Can you believe it? He serenades her.

40:37.399 --> 40:38.739
Well, it sounds rather
romantic to me,

40:38.839 --> 40:40.939
but you wouldn't know
about such things, Stanley.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.979
It would mean joining the human race.

40:43.079 --> 40:46.059
- Here, it's in the study.
- Thank you.

40:46.159 --> 40:50.819
Why do you badger her? She's quite
likable, even if she is a fraud.

40:50.919 --> 40:53.939
You know, one of the
cardinal rules of magic,

40:54.039 --> 40:56.219
is that the magician must
never repeat his trick,

40:56.319 --> 40:58.779
because sooner or later,
one begins to notice the move,

40:58.879 --> 41:01.219
and he's caught.

41:01.319 --> 41:04.090
- But the more I watch her...
- Yes?

41:05.879 --> 41:08.241
The more I'm stumped.

41:11.679 --> 41:13.961
Could she be real?

41:15.239 --> 41:17.459
I'm beginning to question
my own common sense.

41:17.559 --> 41:19.779
I've always questioned
your common sense.

41:19.879 --> 41:23.139
You've always been so certain
about the world, Stanley.

41:23.239 --> 41:25.979
And I've always tried to teach
you that we don't know.

41:26.079 --> 41:28.339
We really don't know.

41:28.439 --> 41:32.179
We're just poor,
limited human beings.

41:32.279 --> 41:35.801
The goldfish doesn't understand
who changes the water in his bowl.

41:35.919 --> 41:37.819
If only she was real,

41:37.919 --> 41:40.459
it would lift the dark cloud that's
followed me since childhood.

41:40.559 --> 41:43.699
Well, I'm sure your fiancée would
appreciate a sunnier bridegroom.

41:43.799 --> 41:47.419
Olivia likes me as I am.
Sophie agrees we're a match made in heaven.

41:47.519 --> 41:49.448
Has she met her?

41:50.319 --> 41:53.779
No, but there,
she's guessing correctly.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.619
I told Brice I'd be late.

41:55.719 --> 41:58.499
I said I was just sitting down
for some of your blood pudding.

41:58.599 --> 42:02.121
Tell me something about my aunt.

42:04.479 --> 42:10.339
Do you have a handkerchief
or an article of clothing,

42:10.439 --> 42:12.419
or a piece of jewelry I could use?

42:12.519 --> 42:14.721
My pearls.

42:23.279 --> 42:25.686
These are beautiful.

42:32.119 --> 42:33.844
Yes.

42:36.559 --> 42:40.299
I'm receiving a... It's cloudy.

42:40.399 --> 42:41.739
Cloudy...

42:41.839 --> 42:45.566
Here comes the usual
theatrical fertilizer.

42:51.479 --> 42:54.364
I see an important Englishman.

42:58.479 --> 43:01.683
Perhaps a member of Parliament.

43:02.439 --> 43:04.209
Go on.

43:06.679 --> 43:08.979
- A love affair.
- I don't believe this.

43:09.079 --> 43:12.579
You cannot possibly know this.

43:12.679 --> 43:14.379
Something's wrong.

43:14.479 --> 43:15.899
What?

43:15.999 --> 43:18.819
- He's married.
- Aunt Vanessa?

43:18.919 --> 43:21.339
- I see a sequence of trysts.
- I've never told her anything.

43:21.439 --> 43:22.899
He cannot leave his wife.

43:22.999 --> 43:24.619
No, he did not.

43:24.719 --> 43:26.539
And so, you're heartbroken.

43:26.639 --> 43:27.739
Sophie, you are a miracle.

43:27.839 --> 43:29.339
And you vow never to love again.

43:29.439 --> 43:30.619
How does she do it?

43:30.719 --> 43:32.979
You're never to marry.

43:33.079 --> 43:35.219
This is beyond comprehension.
I've never known anything like it...

43:35.319 --> 43:37.567
But this is a symbol. This is...

43:37.879 --> 43:39.699
The breakup.

43:39.799 --> 43:44.299
He gave me those on our
last evening together.

43:44.399 --> 43:46.139
- Sophie.
- I'm so sorry.

43:46.239 --> 43:49.899
Sophie, is there really a spirit world?
Do you really tune in on it?

43:49.999 --> 43:52.619
Is there more? Have I not seen it?

43:52.719 --> 43:55.240
Where have you been all my life?

44:01.879 --> 44:05.539
When did you first realize you
had this extraordinary gift?

44:05.639 --> 44:08.579
Very young. My teens.

44:08.679 --> 44:11.699
Well, and you saw it as
a way to make money?

44:11.799 --> 44:15.259
Well, my father abandoned us,
and we were very poor.

44:15.359 --> 44:16.659
But it's astounding.

44:16.759 --> 44:22.459
I mean, I've always believed that the dull,
tragic reality of life is all there is,

44:22.559 --> 44:25.819
- but you are proof that there's more.
- More what?

44:25.919 --> 44:30.363
More mystery, more magic.

44:31.279 --> 44:32.619
Will you...

44:32.719 --> 44:35.859
Dear. Boy.

44:35.959 --> 44:37.619
You leave this to me.

44:37.719 --> 44:41.339
I did get a little anxious vibration when
the engine started smoking back there.

44:41.439 --> 44:44.099
Don't worry, I'm gonna
have a look at this.

44:44.199 --> 44:46.899
I actually have an inkling
as to what this might be.

44:46.999 --> 44:49.419
What are you gonna do?

44:49.519 --> 44:53.139
Yes, not to worry.
I think it's the... I'm actually...

44:53.239 --> 44:56.568
I'm actually rather good at
dealing with anything mechanical.

44:56.759 --> 44:57.779
I don't understand it!

44:57.879 --> 45:00.899
I put the entire engine back together,
and I still have these two pieces.

45:00.999 --> 45:03.379
This doesn't make any sense.

45:03.479 --> 45:06.299
- If I can just get these back into here...
- You should hurry. It's gonna rain.

45:06.399 --> 45:07.779
Don't worry, it's not going to rain.

45:07.879 --> 45:09.299
No, I think I can feel it already.

45:09.399 --> 45:12.259
- No, the skies are clear...
- We gotta put the top up.

45:12.359 --> 45:14.379
- I have to be able to do this...
- We have to put the top up.

45:14.479 --> 45:16.859
- It's raining.
- No, please just give me a minute.

45:16.959 --> 45:18.459
- Stanley, come on...
- If I can only put this in here.

45:18.559 --> 45:20.739
- We have to put the top up. Come here!
- All right.

45:20.839 --> 45:22.979
You can't put the top up
without taking this off.

45:23.079 --> 45:24.339
- What?
- How are you gonna do it without the...

45:24.439 --> 45:25.579
- The canopy has to come off.
- Okay, okay.

45:25.679 --> 45:27.219
Okay, lift! Pull!

45:27.319 --> 45:29.059
- It's stuck, it's stuck!
- All right.

45:29.159 --> 45:30.939
No, don't do that.
You'll break it, you'll break it...

45:31.039 --> 45:32.579
It's lightning, it's lightning.
We'll be killed.

45:32.679 --> 45:34.539
- There must be a catch somewhere.
- What do we do?

45:34.639 --> 45:37.219
- Get under the car!
- God, I don't want to go under the car!

45:37.319 --> 45:40.539
It's fine. It's on four rubber wheels!
It can't get struck by lightning!

45:40.639 --> 45:42.489
- Just go under there!
- No!

45:43.799 --> 45:44.979
We're gonna die!

45:45.079 --> 45:47.361
- Run! Run!
- Run?

45:50.879 --> 45:52.524
Stanley!

45:53.999 --> 45:55.419
Come now, I've got you.

45:55.519 --> 45:57.219
- I've got you.
- Okay.

45:57.319 --> 45:58.619
- My God!
- God, we're gonna die.

45:58.719 --> 46:00.379
- I know this place!
- What?

46:00.479 --> 46:01.619
I can... I know this place!

46:01.719 --> 46:03.019
- How?
- We can go in there.

46:03.119 --> 46:04.939
- Let's run! Go!
- Come on.

46:05.039 --> 46:06.779
- Will it be open?
- Well, it'll be open!

46:06.879 --> 46:09.889
It always used to be open.

46:10.919 --> 46:14.099
- Goodness! I found that rather exhilarating.
- Did you see that lightning?

46:14.199 --> 46:15.539
Goodness me.

46:15.639 --> 46:16.899
I can't believe I found this place.

46:16.999 --> 46:18.379
- What is this?
- It's an observatory.

46:18.479 --> 46:21.139
- I came here as a boy.
- Thank God we found it.

46:21.239 --> 46:23.059
We just got a little wet. It's water.

46:23.159 --> 46:25.259
Are you kidding? We could've
been struck by lightning.

46:25.359 --> 46:28.059
We could die of pneumonia.

46:28.159 --> 46:29.779
I'm sure your fiancée
wouldn't be too pleased.

46:29.879 --> 46:32.339
Well, this would never have
happened if Olivia was here.

46:32.439 --> 46:33.779
No?

46:33.879 --> 46:37.019
She's too competent.
She'd have fixed the car.

46:37.119 --> 46:38.659
Is she also a mechanic?

46:38.759 --> 46:41.099
Well, she's one of those people
who's good at everything.

46:41.199 --> 46:42.299
How lucky for you.

46:42.399 --> 46:43.819
- Yes, yes.
- That's...

46:43.919 --> 46:45.848
I suppose so.

46:50.039 --> 46:51.604
What are you staring at?

46:52.439 --> 46:55.688
You have no idea how
miserable you look.

46:56.919 --> 47:00.259
I'm freezing. I mean, the...

47:00.359 --> 47:02.539
Can you hold me, or something?

47:02.639 --> 47:04.259
I can offer you my waistcoat.

47:04.359 --> 47:05.779
No, you're wetter than I am.

47:05.879 --> 47:10.482
Just put an arm around me,
or you know... Body heat, it's...

47:13.079 --> 47:15.819
My aunt used to bring
me here as a boy.

47:15.919 --> 47:17.379
The roof opens up.

47:17.479 --> 47:18.979
Really?

47:19.079 --> 47:21.379
You can see the universe.

47:21.479 --> 47:22.819
It's menacing.

47:22.919 --> 47:24.299
Can you open it?

47:24.399 --> 47:26.619
I hardly think that's the
brightest idea at the moment.

47:26.719 --> 47:30.401
- We just ran away from that.
It's still up there. - Right, right.

47:31.879 --> 47:34.810
Just have to wait it out.

47:38.399 --> 47:41.019
What was so menacing
about the universe?

47:41.119 --> 47:42.559
The size.

47:43.279 --> 47:46.085
Of course, I was much smaller, then.

47:48.479 --> 47:50.899
Poor Howard's car.

47:50.999 --> 47:52.849
Are you a little warmer now?

47:56.279 --> 47:59.499
Tell me, with all your
powers of prognostication,

47:59.599 --> 48:01.619
could you have ever predicted,

48:01.719 --> 48:05.419
when you first saw me vanishing an
elephant onstage in my Chinese ensemble,

48:05.519 --> 48:07.579
that you and I would one day

48:07.679 --> 48:13.419
end up in a deserted celestial observatory
in a rainstorm in the south of France?

48:13.519 --> 48:15.179
It's highly ironic.

48:15.279 --> 48:17.368
It's morbid.

48:19.359 --> 48:22.290
I feel sleepy. I'm going
to have a little nap.

48:41.959 --> 48:44.299
The rain stopped.

48:44.399 --> 48:48.219
It stopped a while ago.
I didn't want to wake you.

48:48.319 --> 48:50.899
You looked too peaceful sleeping.

48:50.999 --> 48:55.099
Yes, it's the first peaceful sleep
I've had in a very long time.

48:55.199 --> 48:57.459
Does this thing open the roof?

48:57.559 --> 49:02.128
Yes, let me show you.
I've never forgotten this.

49:17.279 --> 49:19.481
You find that menacing?

49:20.839 --> 49:22.245
No.

49:27.839 --> 49:30.724
I'd say it was pretty romantic.

49:36.719 --> 49:40.539
Who stole my heart away

49:40.639 --> 49:44.539
Who makes me dream all day

49:44.639 --> 49:48.480
Dreams I know can never come true

49:48.719 --> 49:52.765
Seems as though I'll never be blue

49:52.879 --> 49:55.139
Who

49:55.239 --> 49:58.979
Means my happiness
Who

49:59.079 --> 50:02.283
Would I answer yes to

50:03.719 --> 50:07.459
Well, you ought to guess who
Who?

50:07.559 --> 50:09.727
No one, but you

50:10.959 --> 50:13.161
Penny for your thoughts.

50:15.879 --> 50:17.490
Nothing.

50:17.599 --> 50:21.699
Well, you know what my thoughts are?
I've already told you I want to marry you.

50:21.799 --> 50:24.739
That we'll get married at summer's
end at the Donaldsons' yacht.

50:24.839 --> 50:28.299
It's enormous, and it can accommodate
all the guests we'd want to have.

50:28.399 --> 50:31.459
And then after the wedding,
we sail it, with those who wish,

50:31.559 --> 50:33.179
from Monaco to Greece,

50:33.279 --> 50:35.099
and then we honeymoon
on the Greek Islands.

50:35.199 --> 50:37.401
What do you think?

50:39.479 --> 50:43.059
That's pretty swanky stuff
for a girl from Kalamazoo.

50:43.159 --> 50:44.739
And then we'll live in Europe.

50:44.839 --> 50:46.979
You'll run your foundation.
You'll be world-famous.

50:47.079 --> 50:48.565
I'll be so proud of you.

50:48.799 --> 50:51.379
You know, my mom has been so
happy since you've been here.

50:51.479 --> 50:55.525
Before you came, she was so glum,
and now she's all aglow.

50:57.119 --> 51:01.779
Pierre! Bring the boxes up to
mademoiselle's room. Merci!

51:01.879 --> 51:02.979
What are those?

51:03.079 --> 51:06.459
Well, you know those dresses you were
fawning over when we walked through town?

51:06.559 --> 51:09.219
I got them for you. All of them.

51:09.319 --> 51:11.647
I told you I was gonna pamper you.

51:13.879 --> 51:15.319
Who?

51:15.679 --> 51:19.804
Shall I sell the beach house
on the Jersey Shore?

51:21.039 --> 51:22.539
Then, I won't.

51:22.639 --> 51:26.339
I really didn't want to.
It has such sentimental meaning.

51:26.439 --> 51:28.379
I'm so glad you said that, Harry.

51:28.479 --> 51:30.522
Go on.

51:31.239 --> 51:35.299
Harry, I hope this question
doesn't embarrass you,

51:35.399 --> 51:39.739
but I have to ask it.

51:39.839 --> 51:42.406
Were you always faithful to me?

51:44.479 --> 51:46.419
I knew it!

51:46.519 --> 51:49.539
Certain so-called friends of
mine suggested otherwise,

51:49.639 --> 51:53.366
that you had a long affair
with Sally Summers.

51:55.879 --> 51:58.499
No, I really didn't believe it.

51:58.599 --> 52:01.299
But I'm ashamed
to admit, I did wonder.

52:01.399 --> 52:03.419
Harry...

52:03.519 --> 52:07.565
I'm so relieved to know
that I was the only one.

52:09.759 --> 52:13.281
I was the only one, wasn't I?

52:17.639 --> 52:20.240
How wonderful you make me feel.

52:21.359 --> 52:23.779
Well, look who's strolling
the grounds this morning!

52:23.879 --> 52:25.139
Why aren't you in
your room, practicing?

52:25.239 --> 52:27.219
I'm too excited to lock myself away.

52:27.319 --> 52:28.459
What are you and Brice up to?

52:28.559 --> 52:30.499
Brice is away for the week, in Paris.

52:30.599 --> 52:32.819
Mother and I are going swimming.

52:32.919 --> 52:34.979
I'm sure swimming isn't
your favorite pastime.

52:35.079 --> 52:37.139
Nonsense. I accept your invitation.

52:37.239 --> 52:39.579
Just need to buy a bathing suit,
and I'll, meet you by the pool.

52:39.679 --> 52:40.979
We're not going to the pool.

52:41.079 --> 52:42.419
We prefer to swim off the rocks.

52:42.519 --> 52:44.299
The rocks? Even better.

52:44.399 --> 52:46.939
Live dangerously, I say.
You only live once.

52:47.039 --> 52:48.339
Or maybe two or three times,

52:48.439 --> 52:51.040
depending on your
supply of ectoplasm.

52:51.559 --> 52:54.099
You are a much better swimmer
than I would have imagined.

52:54.199 --> 52:55.979
I'm also a much better dancer.

52:56.079 --> 52:58.779
Really? You must take
me dancing sometime.

52:58.879 --> 53:00.179
Perhaps I shall,

53:00.279 --> 53:04.259
now that life is no longer weary,
stale, flat and unprofitable.

53:04.359 --> 53:06.099
That's from something.

53:06.199 --> 53:08.179
Is that Dickens?

53:08.279 --> 53:09.819
Dear, poor thing.

53:09.919 --> 53:13.019
Madam, your wunderkind
has much catching up to do.

53:13.119 --> 53:14.299
Isn't that Dickens?

53:14.399 --> 53:16.010
That's Dickens.

53:37.799 --> 53:39.539
The Seventh is actually
one of my favorites

53:39.639 --> 53:42.019
of Beethoven's symphonies,
but if you haven't heard them,

53:42.119 --> 53:44.379
the string quartets are sublime.

53:44.479 --> 53:47.939
Especially the late ones,
the... the 15th and the 16th.

53:48.039 --> 53:50.659
Of course, they are rather
intellectually demanding,

53:50.759 --> 53:51.819
but that's the thing
about intelligence.

53:51.919 --> 53:53.419
You must never despair.

53:53.519 --> 53:55.528
Yours can be raised.

54:04.639 --> 54:05.899
You know, it's extraordinary.

54:05.999 --> 54:09.219
I have smelled these
flowers a hundred times,

54:09.319 --> 54:13.459
and yet I have never really
smelled them until now.

54:13.559 --> 54:15.219
What a pity.

54:15.319 --> 54:18.779
All the rest of the human race
that you consider boobs,

54:18.879 --> 54:21.059
smelling flowers and
you all left out.

54:21.159 --> 54:23.019
Now, wait. Yes.

54:23.119 --> 54:26.219
They... They've enjoyed,
but mindlessly,

54:26.319 --> 54:29.579
because they never thought.
They never... They never stopped

54:29.679 --> 54:33.299
for a moment to consider what a
rotten deal it all appears to be.

54:33.399 --> 54:36.419
To be born, to have
committed no crime,

54:36.519 --> 54:38.721
and yet to be sentenced to death.

54:39.039 --> 54:42.800
But notice I say, "Appears to be."

54:43.159 --> 54:46.699
Alvin, hello. It's Stanley Crawford.

54:46.799 --> 54:48.379
Yes, Wei Ling Crawford.

54:48.479 --> 54:50.019
How are you?

54:50.119 --> 54:51.339
Good, splendid.

54:51.439 --> 54:54.979
Listen, Alvin, I have the story
of a lifetime for your paper

54:55.079 --> 54:57.659
and I wanted you to have it first.

54:57.759 --> 55:00.219
No... Well, yes, it is a...

55:00.319 --> 55:04.059
It's a theatrical piece, but it's...
It's much more than that, much more.

55:04.159 --> 55:05.899
It's science, it's...

55:05.999 --> 55:09.328
It's philosophy, it's religion.

55:15.439 --> 55:17.699
Brice is coming home
tonight from Paris.

55:17.799 --> 55:20.259
The week went so fast.

55:20.359 --> 55:23.483
Have you decided to accept
Brice's marriage proposal?

55:24.159 --> 55:27.059
Well, he is pushing me very hard.

55:27.159 --> 55:29.299
Well, I'd grab it if I were you.

55:29.399 --> 55:30.459
I mean, it'd be logical.

55:30.559 --> 55:33.539
An uneducated nobody from
some ridiculous-sounding city,

55:33.639 --> 55:37.819
gifted, miraculously,
through no achievement of your own,

55:37.919 --> 55:40.779
and now you've developed
a taste for high living...

55:40.879 --> 55:43.099
Yachts, motorcars.

55:43.199 --> 55:45.139
You know, Stanley,

55:45.239 --> 55:49.888
I'm not quite as desperate
as you make me out to be.

55:50.919 --> 55:53.779
There have actually
been a number of...

55:53.879 --> 55:56.659
I don't know, substantial men
who have fallen in love with me.

55:56.759 --> 55:58.484
Really?

55:59.159 --> 56:00.499
Well, you could've fooled me.

56:00.599 --> 56:02.339
Although, with the ability you have,

56:02.439 --> 56:06.259
one does automatically
become intriguing...

56:06.359 --> 56:08.019
And you do have agreeable features,

56:08.119 --> 56:11.163
but it's your gift,
I'm sure, which is...

56:12.399 --> 56:16.081
Well, I wouldn't say charming,
but it is impressive.

56:17.479 --> 56:21.001
I mean, even you just said
I have agreeable features.

56:21.479 --> 56:22.939
They're more than agreeable.

56:23.039 --> 56:25.287
Provided the light hits you just so.

56:25.639 --> 56:28.739
Can I ask what time
of day that might be?

56:28.839 --> 56:32.659
Just in case I ever need to look
my best for a job interview?

56:32.759 --> 56:35.179
Dusk. You're prettiest at about 8:20

56:35.279 --> 56:37.379
in the summer,
when the light is fading.

56:37.479 --> 56:39.699
I see, the light must be fading,

56:39.799 --> 56:42.001
so that I'm not too visible.

56:42.239 --> 56:45.099
Exactly. I'm thinking when I do
the vanishing elephant trick,

56:45.199 --> 56:48.448
you must be lit precisely
as I light the elephant.

56:49.759 --> 56:51.848
I don't think I'll pursue that.

56:52.599 --> 56:54.961
You coming to the ball,
at the palace?

56:55.239 --> 56:57.019
Of course I am.

56:57.119 --> 56:59.845
My whole life I've wanted
to go to a ball like that.

57:00.879 --> 57:02.059
Do you have a date?

57:02.159 --> 57:03.739
I do, indeed.

57:03.839 --> 57:06.819
I'm going with the most charming
woman in the south of France.

57:06.919 --> 57:08.644
My Aunt Vanessa.

57:09.519 --> 57:11.219
I like her.

57:11.319 --> 57:12.899
I am going to dance and drink

57:12.999 --> 57:16.259
and enjoy all the things you
have brought to my life.

57:16.359 --> 57:19.290
Maybe you and I can even
have a dance together.

58:43.119 --> 58:45.579
Didn't you say that we might
have a dance together?

58:45.679 --> 58:49.619
Your mental vibrations told
you my feet are killing me.

58:49.719 --> 58:50.859
Please, be my guest.

58:50.959 --> 58:52.659
She so appreciates your support.

58:52.759 --> 58:54.802
Aunt Vanessa?

59:22.319 --> 59:24.339
You know that you're
the only person tonight

59:24.439 --> 59:27.085
who hasn't made a comment
on my appearance.

59:28.199 --> 59:30.179
I'm overwhelmed, Sophie.

59:30.279 --> 59:33.219
I never dreamed you could
look this beautiful.

59:33.319 --> 59:34.805
That's more like it.

59:36.039 --> 59:39.019
You must have moved mountains
to achieve this effect.

59:39.119 --> 59:40.923
Thanks.

59:41.839 --> 59:44.379
And this is all without the
added benefit of the lighting

59:44.479 --> 59:46.488
that you give your elephant.

59:47.439 --> 59:50.882
You know, tomorrow I'm doing
that press conference about you.

59:53.279 --> 59:56.050
Tell me, Stanley.

59:58.679 --> 01:00:00.899
Apart from my gift,

01:00:00.999 --> 01:00:04.203
which has changed your life so...

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:09.563
Have you not, in the...

01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:13.364
In the time that
we've spent together,

01:00:14.359 --> 01:00:17.219
had any other...

01:00:17.319 --> 01:00:20.090
Thoughts about me?

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:23.619
Well, I've already told you,
I'm in awe of you.

01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:25.779
I don't mean as a mystic.

01:00:25.879 --> 01:00:27.699
I'm...

01:00:27.799 --> 01:00:29.888
I mean as a woman.

01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:33.179
As a woman?

01:00:33.279 --> 01:00:34.619
What an odd question.

01:00:34.719 --> 01:00:37.779
I've never technically
regarded you as a woman.

01:00:37.879 --> 01:00:40.139
You were a charlatan who
turned the tables on me,

01:00:40.239 --> 01:00:42.619
and now I feel both
humbled and proud.

01:00:42.719 --> 01:00:44.762
You're proud of me?

01:00:45.239 --> 01:00:47.019
You? No, I'm proud of myself

01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:48.979
for being big enough to
admit that I was wrong

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:51.019
and foolish all these years.

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:54.419
I've been rather snobbish and...
And rude.

01:00:54.519 --> 01:00:57.040
Condescending about
other people's faith.

01:00:57.679 --> 01:01:02.099
So you never thought
about me as a female?

01:01:02.199 --> 01:01:04.299
Well, I was always certain
you were not of my sex,

01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:06.059
if that's what you're asking.

01:01:06.159 --> 01:01:07.819
And quite good to look at.

01:01:07.919 --> 01:01:09.379
I mean, comparatively.

01:01:09.479 --> 01:01:12.219
I've exposed some pretty
unattractive mediums,

01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:14.219
a number of
horrible-looking creatures.

01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:17.819
You do understand,
I'm seriously considering

01:01:17.919 --> 01:01:20.059
marrying Brice Catledge?

01:01:20.159 --> 01:01:22.248
Well, I think you'd be insane not to.

01:01:22.639 --> 01:01:25.240
You don't see it as...

01:01:25.799 --> 01:01:28.379
A little hasty of me?

01:01:28.479 --> 01:01:30.179
Well, it's you who can
foretell the future,

01:01:30.279 --> 01:01:33.339
and I'm sure your vibrations
are very positive.

01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:35.219
And common sense would
say that this man

01:01:35.319 --> 01:01:36.619
is a tremendous catch for you.

01:01:36.719 --> 01:01:40.339
Far beyond what you could hope,
given your trivial resume.

01:01:40.439 --> 01:01:42.539
And of course, now that
you're emerging as a...

01:01:42.639 --> 01:01:45.019
As a phenomenon, you'll always
be able to do quite well,

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:48.539
financially, although nothing
like the Catledge fortune.

01:01:48.639 --> 01:01:50.779
And most of your time
will be spent with your...

01:01:50.879 --> 01:01:53.889
Your foundation,
where he'll be a great help.

01:01:54.279 --> 01:01:56.819
So the time that
we've spent together,

01:01:56.919 --> 01:01:59.019
has just had...

01:01:59.119 --> 01:02:01.939
Had no impact on you...

01:02:02.039 --> 01:02:03.684
Whatsoever?

01:02:06.119 --> 01:02:08.367
I say, don't...

01:02:08.799 --> 01:02:12.970
You don't tell me you're experiencing
romantic feelings for me?

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:15.339
What if I was?

01:02:15.439 --> 01:02:16.699
Well, that's absurd.

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:20.287
You... You... You imagined
that you and I...

01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:25.939
Isn't it enough you've opened
my eyes to the joy of living?

01:02:26.039 --> 01:02:27.339
I mean, you've conquered my mind.

01:02:27.439 --> 01:02:29.979
Do you, do you also need
to conquer my heart?

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:33.203
I just thought, in the time
that we had spent together...

01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:35.659
That you...

01:02:35.759 --> 01:02:37.579
Don't misunderstand me. I...

01:02:37.679 --> 01:02:40.059
I hold you in the highest
possible esteem, and tomorrow,

01:02:40.159 --> 01:02:42.579
I am prepared to tell
the world as much.

01:02:42.679 --> 01:02:44.040
Excuse me.

01:02:50.519 --> 01:02:52.459
There you are, Stanley.

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:56.739
I don't know about you,
but I danced till dawn.

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:58.579
Can you believe the little
medium has grown fond of me?

01:02:58.679 --> 01:03:00.819
Well, why shouldn't she?
According to the newspapers,

01:03:00.919 --> 01:03:02.219
you're her greatest press agent.

01:03:02.319 --> 01:03:04.779
No, no, I mean, I mean,
she's emotionally taken with me.

01:03:04.879 --> 01:03:07.179
I believe she fancies herself
falling in love with me.

01:03:07.279 --> 01:03:08.579
But you're both spoken for.

01:03:08.679 --> 01:03:10.419
I know. It defies all reason.

01:03:10.519 --> 01:03:13.299
She's on the verge of
capturing a rich young man,

01:03:13.399 --> 01:03:14.859
dullard that he is.

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:17.459
And Olivia and I are,
by her own vibrations,

01:03:17.559 --> 01:03:19.099
the acme of congruity.

01:03:19.199 --> 01:03:22.179
Well, it seems you've given
the matter some thought.

01:03:22.279 --> 01:03:24.099
I was rather taken aback.

01:03:24.199 --> 01:03:26.779
She is looking rather
stunning this evening.

01:03:26.879 --> 01:03:28.604
Yes, to be sure.

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:31.299
She did make a rather

01:03:31.399 --> 01:03:33.419
surprising entrance.

01:03:33.519 --> 01:03:36.739
Come, I've got to drive
back to Provence,

01:03:36.839 --> 01:03:40.361
and you have some journalists
to see in a few hours.

01:03:43.839 --> 01:03:46.610
How did you first
discover Miss Baker?

01:03:46.839 --> 01:03:50.379
I came to unmask her, as I
have done countless others,

01:03:50.479 --> 01:03:55.459
but after trying every which way,
came to the indisputable conclusion

01:03:55.559 --> 01:03:57.659
that she is a genuine medium.

01:03:57.759 --> 01:03:59.499
How can you be so certain

01:03:59.599 --> 01:04:01.059
she's authentic?

01:04:01.159 --> 01:04:03.139
I know all the tricks.

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:04.779
Conjuring is my life's passion.

01:04:04.879 --> 01:04:07.659
Debunking fake mediums, my specialty.

01:04:07.759 --> 01:04:09.739
What are her plans for the future?

01:04:09.839 --> 01:04:13.805
She plans to start a foundation and
a school for teaching the occult.

01:04:13.959 --> 01:04:15.699
How does it feel to be wrong

01:04:15.799 --> 01:04:18.819
all these years about the occult?

01:04:18.919 --> 01:04:21.539
Well, on the one side,
I'm embarrassed,

01:04:21.639 --> 01:04:24.339
but also thrilled to finally
be able to take a deep breath

01:04:24.439 --> 01:04:26.339
and see new possibilities in life.

01:04:26.439 --> 01:04:28.379
So, it is fair to say that you feel

01:04:28.479 --> 01:04:31.579
the world is not as
rational and predictable

01:04:31.679 --> 01:04:33.619
as you've always so adamantly,

01:04:33.719 --> 01:04:36.684
and sometimes insultingly, claimed?

01:04:36.879 --> 01:04:39.019
I deserve your criticism, I know.

01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:42.539
I've always been a rational man
with a great faith in science.

01:04:42.639 --> 01:04:44.779
What can I say?

01:04:44.879 --> 01:04:47.859
But it would appear that perhaps,

01:04:47.959 --> 01:04:51.859
to say I believe in
the dignity of man

01:04:51.959 --> 01:04:53.923
is simply not enough.

01:04:55.879 --> 01:04:57.499
Even as a baby, it was clear

01:04:57.599 --> 01:04:59.899
from the very beginning
that she was a special child.

01:04:59.999 --> 01:05:01.699
It's gonna be a
world-class foundation.

01:05:01.799 --> 01:05:03.819
Yes, there'll be students
from all over the world.

01:05:03.919 --> 01:05:05.219
You have to see her.

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:07.859
They are very close friends of mine.
I came at once, but she stumped me,

01:05:07.959 --> 01:05:10.059
so I brought in Mr. Wei
Ling Soo under an alias

01:05:10.159 --> 01:05:11.539
to unmask her.

01:05:11.639 --> 01:05:13.379
Now you see the result.

01:05:13.479 --> 01:05:15.019
And damned if he isn't
her biggest fan.

01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:16.339
There you are. Excuse me.

01:05:16.439 --> 01:05:19.019
- I have some seriously distressing news.
- What?

01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:20.739
Your aunt's been in a serious
automobile accident.

01:05:20.839 --> 01:05:22.219
What happened? Is she all right?

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:24.979
- She's in critical condition at the hospital.
- I need to get there.

01:05:25.079 --> 01:05:26.779
- Yes, of course, I'll drive you.
- Do you want me...

01:05:26.879 --> 01:05:28.729
To come with you? I know the way...

01:05:46.239 --> 01:05:47.539
Jacques.

01:05:47.639 --> 01:05:49.139
Bonjour, George.

01:05:49.239 --> 01:05:51.699
- This is Stanley.
- Yes, how do you do?

01:05:51.799 --> 01:05:54.240
So, how's she doing?
What's happening?

01:05:55.679 --> 01:05:57.779
- What was...
- En anglais.

01:05:57.879 --> 01:06:00.179
She's in the operating room now.

01:06:00.279 --> 01:06:01.539
Everyone is doing his best.

01:06:01.639 --> 01:06:04.179
So what do you think?
Is she going to be all right?

01:06:04.279 --> 01:06:06.939
At this moment, it's touch-and-go.

01:06:07.039 --> 01:06:08.579
Touch-and-go?

01:06:08.679 --> 01:06:10.299
You... You can wait there,
if you want.

01:06:10.399 --> 01:06:11.979
- Touch-and-go.
- You're in surgery with her?

01:06:12.079 --> 01:06:13.849
Yeah, I know.

01:06:19.839 --> 01:06:22.139
Now, don't worry.
They have an excellent staff here.

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:23.779
You know, she's an incredible woman.

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.659
She practically raised me.

01:06:25.759 --> 01:06:27.819
She's been through a lot in her life.

01:06:27.919 --> 01:06:29.579
Sit down. Let me get you some tea.

01:06:29.679 --> 01:06:31.819
No, I'm too shaken up for tea.

01:06:31.919 --> 01:06:33.579
Well, perhaps I can
scare up a whiskey?

01:06:33.679 --> 01:06:35.139
Better idea.

01:06:35.239 --> 01:06:36.819
You know, she shouldn't be
allowed to drive at her age.

01:06:36.919 --> 01:06:39.259
Well, it's in the hands
of the doctors now.

01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:41.299
I know how helpless one feels,

01:06:41.399 --> 01:06:44.939
but all you can do is
just keep calm and pray.

01:06:45.039 --> 01:06:46.739
Yes.

01:06:46.839 --> 01:06:48.979
The power of prayer.

01:06:49.079 --> 01:06:51.899
- Always ridiculed it.
- As have I.

01:06:51.999 --> 01:06:54.819
And yet, some people swear by it.

01:06:54.919 --> 01:06:57.579
You know, I know this sounds crass,

01:06:57.679 --> 01:07:01.699
particularly coming from me,
a man of science, but...

01:07:01.799 --> 01:07:03.419
If the worst happens,

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.019
at least through Sophie,

01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:08.880
you'll be able to contact her spirit.

01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:10.890
Yes.

01:07:11.519 --> 01:07:12.859
Yes, that's comforting, isn't it?

01:07:12.959 --> 01:07:14.099
Yes.

01:07:14.199 --> 01:07:16.640
I never thought I'd say it, but yes.

01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:18.659
Well, you buck up,

01:07:18.759 --> 01:07:21.121
and I will find that whiskey.

01:07:51.319 --> 01:07:54.045
I don't know if you can hear me

01:07:56.159 --> 01:08:00.379
and I haven't always led
an exemplary life. I've...

01:08:00.479 --> 01:08:03.499
I've not only been a skeptic,

01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:06.939
a non-believer,
but been much worse...

01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:10.459
A man with contempt for...

01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:14.579
For people who give themselves
over to the idea that...

01:08:14.679 --> 01:08:18.645
That there's some kind of
benevolent father figure up there.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:23.899
I've always said it was childish,
wishful thinking, strictly for primitives,

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:26.499
all these, all these hopes about a...

01:08:26.599 --> 01:08:27.819
A purpose for life,

01:08:27.919 --> 01:08:30.538
a larger meaning.

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:34.819
That all our suffering will
somehow accrue to some...

01:08:34.919 --> 01:08:37.121
Greater plan.

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:44.564
But if what I see of late is real

01:08:46.519 --> 01:08:49.165
then I don't have all the answers.

01:08:49.999 --> 01:08:52.618
It's possible,

01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:54.618
even logical, that...

01:08:54.719 --> 01:08:57.618
We are here by design,

01:08:57.719 --> 01:09:00.081
to search some higher ideal.

01:09:01.959 --> 01:09:04.059
And that you...

01:09:04.158 --> 01:09:06.087
Could be real.

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:14.459
And although I have no
right to expect anything,

01:09:14.559 --> 01:09:16.939
my aunt,

01:09:17.038 --> 01:09:18.459
whom I love,

01:09:18.559 --> 01:09:20.761
is in mortal danger.

01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:24.961
And so, I ask you...

01:09:26.679 --> 01:09:28.881
I ask you...

01:09:38.599 --> 01:09:40.528
Wait a minute.

01:09:44.559 --> 01:09:46.819
This is the stupidest

01:09:46.919 --> 01:09:50.328
load of twaddle I have ever heard.

01:09:51.799 --> 01:09:54.659
My common sense tells me,

01:09:54.759 --> 01:09:57.819
I'm falling into a seductive morass

01:09:57.919 --> 01:10:02.010
of sugarcoated claptrap because
I want my aunt to be all right.

01:10:05.319 --> 01:10:07.939
That girl...

01:10:08.039 --> 01:10:10.207
Is a fake.

01:10:13.319 --> 01:10:14.699
I told you the surgeons
were wonderful.

01:10:14.799 --> 01:10:15.859
Should I not stay?

01:10:15.959 --> 01:10:17.379
Well, there's nothing
for you to do here.

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:20.299
She's sleeping comfortably.
She responded well to the drugs.

01:10:20.399 --> 01:10:22.899
The surgery went beautifully.
She's out of danger.

01:10:22.999 --> 01:10:25.699
You know, after you left,
I began to pray for her.

01:10:25.799 --> 01:10:26.859
Really?

01:10:26.959 --> 01:10:30.099
Then I rejected the entire
notion as pure poppycock.

01:10:30.199 --> 01:10:32.459
And that includes Miss Sophie Baker.

01:10:32.559 --> 01:10:33.899
Is that right?

01:10:33.999 --> 01:10:36.179
Well, if Sophie is a fraud,

01:10:36.279 --> 01:10:39.881
then how does she do what she does?

01:11:06.519 --> 01:11:07.699
Stanley!

01:11:07.799 --> 01:11:09.099
- We were all so worried.
- So worried!

01:11:09.199 --> 01:11:11.099
You can imagine how anxious we were

01:11:11.199 --> 01:11:12.419
about your Aunt Vanessa.

01:11:12.519 --> 01:11:14.739
- Yes!
- Thank God!

01:11:14.839 --> 01:11:19.099
Madam, I can assure you,
God had nothing to do with it.

01:11:19.199 --> 01:11:20.844
She had good doctors.

01:11:20.959 --> 01:11:24.059
Yeah, we have all been
on tenterhooks, Stanley.

01:11:24.159 --> 01:11:26.099
Well, couldn't Sophie have
predicted the outcome

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.139
and put all your minds at ease?

01:11:28.239 --> 01:11:30.019
Me? I didn't even know.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:32.059
I was so mobbed
by all the press, I...

01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:34.939
If I had known, I would have
gone with you to the hospital.

01:11:35.039 --> 01:11:36.179
Well, it's all over.

01:11:36.279 --> 01:11:38.659
And, "All's well that ends well."

01:11:38.759 --> 01:11:40.609
That's not Dickens.

01:11:41.239 --> 01:11:43.259
Well, now that
everything's ended well,

01:11:43.359 --> 01:11:45.579
shall we repair to the garden?

01:11:45.679 --> 01:11:47.779
- Brice? Mrs. Baker?
- Me? Great idea.

01:11:47.879 --> 01:11:50.499
I'm so excited about the further
details of the foundation.

01:11:50.599 --> 01:11:52.939
- I want to talk over...
- Actually, there are a few financial details...

01:11:53.039 --> 01:11:54.579
Mother, I'm just gonna stay here.

01:11:54.679 --> 01:11:55.859
And thank you, by the way.

01:11:55.959 --> 01:12:00.164
And I really want to go into
some detail about how much...

01:12:01.039 --> 01:12:04.499
Stanley, I can't imagine what has
been going through your mind.

01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:06.939
I mean, Aunt Vanessa's
such a dear woman.

01:12:07.039 --> 01:12:09.099
Yes, well, a man in a
hospital waiting room

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:11.939
while a loved one is under the
knife has many feverish thoughts.

01:12:12.039 --> 01:12:14.619
I imagined that if I prayed

01:12:14.719 --> 01:12:17.001
my prayers might be heard.

01:12:17.279 --> 01:12:19.099
You thought of praying?

01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:22.139
I never imagined I would
hear those words.

01:12:22.239 --> 01:12:25.419
And my ace in the hole,
so to speak, was that...

01:12:25.519 --> 01:12:27.339
Even if the worst had
happened and Aunt Vanessa

01:12:27.439 --> 01:12:29.819
had sadly passed away,
you could always put me in touch

01:12:29.919 --> 01:12:32.419
with her in the spirit world,
and that...

01:12:32.519 --> 01:12:34.499
That rather put a smile on my face.

01:12:34.599 --> 01:12:37.339
Well, in the end, she pulled through.

01:12:37.439 --> 01:12:39.019
Well, you look exhausted.

01:12:39.119 --> 01:12:40.459
Well, can you blame me?

01:12:40.559 --> 01:12:44.139
What I need now is a good
bath and a nap and...

01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:46.419
- So, if you'll excuse me...
- Yes, of course.

01:12:46.519 --> 01:12:48.448
Stanley...

01:12:49.439 --> 01:12:51.819
I'm so relieved about Aunt Vanessa.

01:12:51.919 --> 01:12:54.179
She's such a marvelous woman.

01:12:54.279 --> 01:12:56.179
Yeah, she's so lovely.

01:12:56.279 --> 01:12:57.979
We should break open the champagne.

01:12:58.079 --> 01:13:00.259
We should celebrate.

01:13:00.359 --> 01:13:02.939
Aunt Vanessa's recovered.
Not to mention

01:13:03.039 --> 01:13:08.405
that I find this whole thing
a most rewarding experience.

01:13:10.079 --> 01:13:12.043
You feel no remorse?

01:13:13.039 --> 01:13:14.619
Why should I feel remorse?

01:13:14.719 --> 01:13:17.570
Hoodwinking a lifelong friend.

01:13:19.719 --> 01:13:20.979
I see it quite differently.

01:13:21.079 --> 01:13:23.327
Hoodwinking is what we do.

01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:26.139
Now, you've got to understand
that since we were boys,

01:13:26.239 --> 01:13:27.979
I have played second fiddle

01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:30.019
to that egomaniacal,
self-regarding...

01:13:30.119 --> 01:13:31.179
Genius.

01:13:31.279 --> 01:13:32.779
Yeah, he's a genius at what he does,

01:13:32.879 --> 01:13:35.419
and I turned out to be a mere mortal.

01:13:35.519 --> 01:13:39.059
But now, after years
of trailing in his wake,

01:13:39.159 --> 01:13:41.219
and I admit,
some envy and resentment,

01:13:41.319 --> 01:13:45.699
I have finally put one over
the great Wei Ling Soo.

01:13:45.799 --> 01:13:49.939
I have fooled the man
who could not be fooled.

01:13:50.039 --> 01:13:52.924
Not quite, Howard.

01:13:54.119 --> 01:13:56.379
- How did...
- You admired this effect when

01:13:56.479 --> 01:13:58.299
you saw my show in Berlin.

01:13:58.399 --> 01:14:00.339
I said I'd teach it to you
if you behaved yourself,

01:14:00.439 --> 01:14:02.880
but you have not behaved.

01:14:03.239 --> 01:14:05.099
It's a trick, Sophie.

01:14:05.199 --> 01:14:08.659
I don't really dematerialize
and reassemble my ectoplasm

01:14:08.759 --> 01:14:11.979
any more than you contact
spirits or read minds.

01:14:12.079 --> 01:14:13.579
Stanley, I can explain...

01:14:13.679 --> 01:14:16.099
I watched you so closely.

01:14:16.199 --> 01:14:18.339
Howard watched your mother,

01:14:18.439 --> 01:14:21.768
but who watched Howard?

01:14:22.839 --> 01:14:24.459
You were free to rap on the table.

01:14:24.559 --> 01:14:26.619
You seized the floating candle,
you swore there were no wires

01:14:26.719 --> 01:14:30.619
making it float, and I
took you at your word.

01:14:30.719 --> 01:14:32.659
You were free to rap
once for yes, twice for no.

01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:35.539
And when Sophie excused
herself at my aunt's

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:39.019
to make a telephone call,
she called you

01:14:39.119 --> 01:14:43.324
and you fed her information
about my aunt.

01:14:43.999 --> 01:14:46.566
At first, I couldn't believe
you would betray me like that.

01:14:47.999 --> 01:14:49.859
But, as you know,

01:14:49.959 --> 01:14:52.019
I am a misanthrope.

01:14:52.119 --> 01:14:53.899
And that people do
unconscionable things

01:14:53.999 --> 01:14:57.179
does not run counter to my
normal view of humanity.

01:14:57.279 --> 01:15:00.939
As boys, we both chose
magic as our calling.

01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:04.739
We both practiced day and night,
I as much as you.

01:15:04.839 --> 01:15:08.979
My skill was the equal of yours,
and yet, you emerged

01:15:09.079 --> 01:15:12.123
onto the world stage
as the great artist.

01:15:12.599 --> 01:15:13.819
But it wasn't fair.

01:15:13.919 --> 01:15:16.360
Life's not fair, Howard.

01:15:16.839 --> 01:15:21.124
In fact, as a general rule, as I've
often said, it's pretty nasty.

01:15:22.399 --> 01:15:24.124
Because of Sophie,

01:15:24.759 --> 01:15:27.530
I began to succumb
to magical thinking.

01:15:28.599 --> 01:15:31.450
And for a while,
I was actually happy.

01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:34.379
But I was happy as a fool is happy.

01:15:34.479 --> 01:15:37.219
Happiness is not the
natural human condition.

01:15:37.319 --> 01:15:39.659
And incidentally, you never
practiced as much as I did,

01:15:39.759 --> 01:15:41.459
and your skill was
never equal to mine.

01:15:41.559 --> 01:15:42.979
Stanley, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

01:15:43.079 --> 01:15:46.259
I ran into Howard here when he
was sent to expose me, and he...

01:15:46.359 --> 01:15:49.099
He did expose me, quite easily.

01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:51.179
But we made this private
pact to do this scheme,

01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:55.564
and I only agreed because it
meant so much to Mom and me.

01:15:56.039 --> 01:15:58.779
I view your behavior as...

01:15:58.879 --> 01:16:02.259
A great man views the
malicious mischief of...

01:16:02.359 --> 01:16:04.819
What shall we say, pygmy?

01:16:04.919 --> 01:16:06.419
You're a fake.

01:16:06.519 --> 01:16:09.699
As I always should have known,
and did, in my heart.

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:12.843
I only wish I hadn't wasted
so much time with you.

01:16:13.599 --> 01:16:18.299
Well, now you're just being
a pompous stick in the mud.

01:16:18.399 --> 01:16:20.579
We played an elaborate
joke on you, Stanley.

01:16:20.679 --> 01:16:22.299
No one was harmed.

01:16:22.399 --> 01:16:25.579
My reputation will suffer,
and you played me for a fool.

01:16:25.679 --> 01:16:28.059
Your reputation is all ego!

01:16:28.159 --> 01:16:29.579
I've...

01:16:29.679 --> 01:16:33.059
Yes, yes, things got out of hand,
but no awful thing happened.

01:16:33.159 --> 01:16:35.259
I mean, you were... You were happy.

01:16:35.359 --> 01:16:37.699
And you enjoyed life for once.

01:16:37.799 --> 01:16:40.579
You saw the world as
optimists see the world.

01:16:40.679 --> 01:16:43.259
And we had some laughs
together, so don't...

01:16:43.359 --> 01:16:44.779
Say that you wasted
your time with me.

01:16:44.879 --> 01:16:46.499
What would you have been doing?

01:16:46.599 --> 01:16:50.419
Sitting in your room and shuffling
cards in front of a mirror?

01:16:50.519 --> 01:16:52.579
All my optimism was an illusion.

01:16:52.679 --> 01:16:54.339
Well, I started reading that book

01:16:54.439 --> 01:16:56.939
by that German philosopher,
you know, that you gave me?

01:16:57.039 --> 01:16:58.979
I didn't really
understand much of it,

01:16:59.079 --> 01:17:02.099
but he said that we need
our illusions to live.

01:17:02.199 --> 01:17:03.730
You mean lies.

01:17:04.039 --> 01:17:07.379
You were much happier when you
let some lies into your life, Stanley.

01:17:07.479 --> 01:17:10.619
Think about it, Stanley, do you
really want to ruin the peace of mind

01:17:10.719 --> 01:17:11.779
Grace Catledge has,

01:17:11.879 --> 01:17:15.299
secure in the knowledge that
she is her husband's only love?

01:17:15.399 --> 01:17:17.339
We can't go around
deluding ourselves.

01:17:17.439 --> 01:17:19.579
But we must.

01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:22.139
If we're to get through life.

01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:26.763
I mean, I didn't say it,
I'm just quoting, you know, Mister...

01:17:28.559 --> 01:17:29.499
Nietzsche.

01:17:29.599 --> 01:17:32.019
And, in the end, who really knows

01:17:32.119 --> 01:17:33.659
- what's real and what's not?
- Well, it's quite clear

01:17:33.759 --> 01:17:35.939
what's real, my praying
for my aunt was poppycock,

01:17:36.039 --> 01:17:37.619
the doctor's skill was real.

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:40.459
No. You will never know that,
because George,

01:17:40.559 --> 01:17:43.339
Caroline's husband,
the psychoanalyst,

01:17:43.439 --> 01:17:45.819
told me that he was praying
for your aunt, too.

01:17:45.919 --> 01:17:47.259
And so we don't know if maybe

01:17:47.359 --> 01:17:49.499
it was his prayers that got answered.

01:17:49.599 --> 01:17:51.608
Maybe the angels like him better.

01:17:51.759 --> 01:17:54.819
I won't dignify this
conversation any longer.

01:17:54.919 --> 01:17:56.419
I'm going to go and
visit my Aunt Vanessa

01:17:56.519 --> 01:17:59.339
until she's on her feet,
and then good-bye.

01:17:59.439 --> 01:18:01.459
And you won't forgive me?

01:18:01.559 --> 01:18:03.339
Well, I can't forgive you.

01:18:03.439 --> 01:18:05.779
Only God can forgive you.

01:18:05.879 --> 01:18:08.047
But you said there is no God.

01:18:08.999 --> 01:18:11.281
Precisely my point.

01:19:08.999 --> 01:19:10.379
It's good to be home.

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:13.459
More robust than ever, I'll wager.

01:19:13.559 --> 01:19:15.139
"What doesn't kill me...

01:19:15.239 --> 01:19:18.219
"Makes me stronger."
A great man said that.

01:19:18.319 --> 01:19:19.899
Not the "God is dead" fellow.

01:19:19.999 --> 01:19:22.739
- The very same.
- Nevertheless, I think he was wrong.

01:19:22.839 --> 01:19:24.819
What doesn't kill us often
knocks the hell out of us.

01:19:24.919 --> 01:19:28.441
Well, sometimes a close
call wakes a person up.

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:31.899
I've had another idea
for our honeymoon.

01:19:31.999 --> 01:19:33.979
What if, after the Greek Islands,

01:19:34.079 --> 01:19:35.699
we set sail for the South Seas.

01:19:35.799 --> 01:19:37.859
I've always wanted
to visit Bora-Bora.

01:19:37.959 --> 01:19:39.259
Would that interest you?

01:19:39.359 --> 01:19:40.979
I've never... I've never heard of it,

01:19:41.079 --> 01:19:43.659
but the name sounds pretty exotic.

01:19:43.759 --> 01:19:45.927
Exotic?

01:19:46.359 --> 01:19:49.403
I love how you pick always
the exact right word.

01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:55.459
Yes, of course, Olivia.
I'll be home in a few days.

01:19:55.559 --> 01:19:57.979
I just have to see that Aunt
Vanessa is up and running,

01:19:58.079 --> 01:20:00.939
and I have one or two press
interviews I have to do.

01:20:01.039 --> 01:20:02.939
Some things need to be smoothed over.

01:20:03.039 --> 01:20:05.139
This is where I could use your tact.

01:20:05.239 --> 01:20:07.579
Yes, of course. Yes.

01:20:07.679 --> 01:20:09.449
Bye, darling.

01:20:10.999 --> 01:20:12.939
I bet you'll be glad
to get back to London

01:20:13.039 --> 01:20:14.968
and put all this behind you.

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:20.299
You might enjoy the Galapagos.

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:22.099
You're a great admirer of Darwin's.

01:20:22.199 --> 01:20:25.448
Big turtles. Yes, I suppose so.

01:20:26.959 --> 01:20:30.003
And of course, you must miss Olivia.

01:20:33.639 --> 01:20:37.299
A very fine woman. I can tell
that from her photographs.

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:39.139
Such elegance and style.

01:20:39.239 --> 01:20:41.819
Absolutely perfect for
a man of your taste.

01:20:41.919 --> 01:20:44.099
Well, yes, it's, there's no question.

01:20:44.199 --> 01:20:46.659
We're ideally suited.

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:50.179
A very... And you need
a well-educated woman

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:52.561
to keep up with you.

01:20:53.399 --> 01:20:55.259
And she's quite attractive, to boot.

01:20:55.359 --> 01:20:58.619
Yes, yes, it's very easy to see us

01:20:58.719 --> 01:21:01.299
side by side through life's journey.

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:04.499
A very handsome couple indeed.

01:21:04.599 --> 01:21:07.299
Yes, there's no question.
We're ideally suited.

01:21:07.399 --> 01:21:09.219
As you would say.

01:21:09.319 --> 01:21:12.459
A quite rational choice.

01:21:12.559 --> 01:21:15.379
I mean, it's not entirely cerebral.

01:21:15.479 --> 01:21:17.499
I mean, I do love her.

01:21:17.599 --> 01:21:18.979
What are you suggesting?

01:21:19.079 --> 01:21:22.179
- Suggesting?
- In the nuance of your tone?

01:21:22.279 --> 01:21:24.099
Of course I love her.

01:21:24.199 --> 01:21:28.099
Or are you saying you think
I've come to love Sophie Baker?

01:21:28.199 --> 01:21:30.539
Me? I never mentioned Sophie.

01:21:30.639 --> 01:21:32.259
Well, I thought you
were heading there.

01:21:32.359 --> 01:21:34.859
Sophie Baker? The little fake
who played you for a dupe?

01:21:34.959 --> 01:21:36.539
Exactly. That wretch.

01:21:36.639 --> 01:21:38.539
Why would I suggest you've
fallen in love with Sophie?

01:21:38.639 --> 01:21:40.059
Well, you might.

01:21:40.159 --> 01:21:42.539
I never know what goes on
in that devious mind of yours.

01:21:42.639 --> 01:21:47.419
The very idea of you and that
specious American telepathic.

01:21:47.519 --> 01:21:49.779
Well, I know it defies all reason.

01:21:49.879 --> 01:21:53.379
You, a creature of reason.
A man of intellect.

01:21:53.479 --> 01:21:56.059
- To be sure.
- Certainly not trivial.

01:21:56.159 --> 01:21:57.699
No, to say the least.

01:21:57.799 --> 01:22:00.525
And she's hardly in the
same class as Olivia.

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:03.179
The comparison makes me laugh.

01:22:03.279 --> 01:22:05.699
Olivia is a person of
accomplishment and charm.

01:22:05.799 --> 01:22:07.059
Sophie's a street finagler

01:22:07.159 --> 01:22:10.099
who makes her way living off
one bit of hokum to the next.

01:22:10.199 --> 01:22:12.299
Well, I don't see how you
can compare the two.

01:22:12.399 --> 01:22:14.939
Well, don't put ideas into my head!

01:22:15.039 --> 01:22:17.241
Well, far be it from me.

01:22:23.359 --> 01:22:25.979
Of course, she does come
from dire circumstances.

01:22:26.079 --> 01:22:28.419
I mean, it's very
easy to be judgmental

01:22:28.519 --> 01:22:30.579
about people who are
born into circumstances

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.659
less fortunate than one's own.

01:22:32.759 --> 01:22:34.099
Life is harsh.

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:36.459
One must do what one must to survive.

01:22:36.559 --> 01:22:37.779
Well put.

01:22:37.879 --> 01:22:39.819
And people do sometimes
make the wrong choices,

01:22:39.919 --> 01:22:41.819
which they regret,

01:22:41.919 --> 01:22:45.619
even though no serious harm was done.

01:22:45.719 --> 01:22:48.339
Which of us has not made
some blunders in life?

01:22:48.439 --> 01:22:52.099
And there is a rather appealing
quality about Sophie.

01:22:52.199 --> 01:22:54.179
Despite her disgusting behavior.

01:22:54.279 --> 01:22:58.779
Yes, her smile is rather winning.

01:22:58.879 --> 01:23:00.299
Of course, it depends how much value

01:23:00.399 --> 01:23:01.819
you put on the purely physical.

01:23:01.919 --> 01:23:03.619
Well, no, I...

01:23:03.719 --> 01:23:06.779
I, for one, esteem
the higher virtues.

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:09.127
Beauty of the soul.

01:23:11.559 --> 01:23:15.081
Although her eyes are rather
pleasant to look into.

01:23:15.559 --> 01:23:18.139
And that she can be amusing,
under the right circumstances.

01:23:18.239 --> 01:23:21.539
But Olivia is an educated,
cultivated woman.

01:23:21.639 --> 01:23:24.219
One that befits a man
of your artistic genius.

01:23:24.319 --> 01:23:27.019
Yes, now, my genius
must be factored in.

01:23:27.119 --> 01:23:31.819
On paper, there's really no reason
to prefer Sophie to Olivia.

01:23:31.919 --> 01:23:33.962
Well, I would say the opposite.

01:23:35.559 --> 01:23:37.899
And so your suggestion that I,

01:23:37.999 --> 01:23:42.659
I be honest with Olivia and tell
her that irrational as it seems,

01:23:42.759 --> 01:23:45.139
I've fallen in love with Sophie...

01:23:45.239 --> 01:23:47.739
That's a preposterous notion.

01:23:47.839 --> 01:23:50.121
It's lunacy.

01:23:52.959 --> 01:23:54.379
Yet I can't help feeling that...

01:23:54.479 --> 01:23:57.139
That you love Sophie.

01:23:57.239 --> 01:23:58.699
Yes, I understand.

01:23:58.799 --> 01:24:00.619
You're puzzled and bewildered

01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:02.539
because your foolish logic

01:24:02.639 --> 01:24:05.299
tells you that you
should love Olivia.

01:24:05.399 --> 01:24:06.659
Foolish logic?

01:24:06.759 --> 01:24:09.219
And yet, how little that logic means

01:24:09.319 --> 01:24:12.059
when placed next to Sophie's smile.

01:24:12.159 --> 01:24:14.123
What are you saying?

01:24:15.199 --> 01:24:18.899
That the world may or may
not be without purpose,

01:24:18.999 --> 01:24:22.920
but it's not totally without
some kind of magic.

01:24:24.719 --> 01:24:27.843
I have irrational positive
feelings for Sophie Baker.

01:24:29.239 --> 01:24:31.539
It's like witnessing a
trick I can't figure out.

01:24:31.639 --> 01:24:34.299
I wouldn't try to figure it out.
I'd simply move on it.

01:24:34.399 --> 01:24:38.240
Word is, she's already accepted
Brice Catledge's proposal.

01:24:56.719 --> 01:24:59.684
Taken to reading the great books?

01:25:01.359 --> 01:25:02.924
Yes.

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:06.899
Well, you once said not to despair.

01:25:06.999 --> 01:25:09.042
There's hope for my brain.

01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:12.259
Perhaps I was a bit caustic.

01:25:12.359 --> 01:25:16.484
But you will admit you were guilty
of some rather sleazy doings.

01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:19.259
Yes, well, those days are over.

01:25:19.359 --> 01:25:21.619
I no longer have to worry about

01:25:21.719 --> 01:25:25.099
where to sleep and how to eat.

01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:28.846
I take it Brice Catledge has made
a serious marriage proposal?

01:25:29.399 --> 01:25:30.819
Yes.

01:25:30.919 --> 01:25:32.619
A very tempting one.

01:25:32.719 --> 01:25:34.099
Wouldn't you agree?

01:25:34.199 --> 01:25:36.459
Yes, I suppose so.

01:25:36.559 --> 01:25:39.205
But I'm here to make you
a more tempting one.

01:25:39.839 --> 01:25:41.564
More tempting than this?

01:25:42.879 --> 01:25:44.299
I came to say

01:25:44.399 --> 01:25:45.979
that for some inexplicable reason

01:25:46.079 --> 01:25:49.601
that defies common sense
and human understanding,

01:25:50.519 --> 01:25:52.579
that I have, of late,

01:25:52.679 --> 01:25:54.579
experienced some small...

01:25:54.679 --> 01:25:57.419
Quite small, but discernible

01:25:57.519 --> 01:26:00.370
inner stirrings regarding your smile.

01:26:00.719 --> 01:26:02.059
How magnanimous of you.

01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:03.899
Yes, I thought you'd think so.

01:26:03.999 --> 01:26:06.219
And possessing a soul which is large

01:26:06.319 --> 01:26:09.579
and capable of complexity,
as all great minds are,

01:26:09.679 --> 01:26:11.699
I have decided to forgive you

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:14.286
and take you under my wing.

01:26:15.199 --> 01:26:17.083
Your wing?

01:26:17.559 --> 01:26:19.979
It's a saying. Obviously,
I don't have wings.

01:26:20.079 --> 01:26:22.539
I only mean that...

01:26:22.639 --> 01:26:23.979
Incredible as it sounds,

01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:26.299
and this is no small gesture,
given the time wasted

01:26:26.399 --> 01:26:28.259
and the public embarrassment
you've caused me,

01:26:28.359 --> 01:26:30.619
that I'm...

01:26:30.719 --> 01:26:32.921
Willing to take you back.

01:26:33.279 --> 01:26:35.083
Take me back where?

01:26:35.719 --> 01:26:38.490
Under the moon in the observatory.

01:26:38.759 --> 01:26:42.379
I regretted what I was doing,

01:26:42.479 --> 01:26:44.299
but I was too inept to change course,

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:48.179
and I apologize.

01:26:48.279 --> 01:26:49.579
Really.

01:26:49.679 --> 01:26:50.819
And I accept your forgiveness.

01:26:50.919 --> 01:26:52.979
I understand that it's
very generous of you,

01:26:53.079 --> 01:26:54.659
and I have to be going.

01:26:54.759 --> 01:26:57.379
Going? I haven't said
what I came for.

01:26:57.479 --> 01:26:59.179
Well, then just say it and go,

01:26:59.279 --> 01:27:02.005
because I have a dinner
to go to with my fiancé.

01:27:02.799 --> 01:27:04.859
I'm here to say

01:27:04.959 --> 01:27:07.299
that in spite of everything,

01:27:07.399 --> 01:27:10.125
I am willing to
consider marrying you.

01:27:10.519 --> 01:27:12.059
- What?
- Naturally,

01:27:12.159 --> 01:27:15.841
you can't believe your good fortune.
I appreciate that.

01:27:16.519 --> 01:27:19.179
Stanley, brilliant as you
are with a deck of cards,

01:27:19.279 --> 01:27:23.040
you are terrible at proposing.

01:27:24.159 --> 01:27:26.379
- I've never proposed before.
- Really?

01:27:26.479 --> 01:27:28.681
Not even to your fiancée?

01:27:28.999 --> 01:27:31.219
She proposed marriage.

01:27:31.319 --> 01:27:34.259
The truth is I've never really
felt the urge to propose before.

01:27:34.359 --> 01:27:35.659
Use your head!

01:27:35.759 --> 01:27:38.459
We're not a match made in heaven,

01:27:38.559 --> 01:27:41.819
and as you've said before many times,

01:27:41.919 --> 01:27:45.043
when the heart rules
the head, disaster follows.

01:27:45.399 --> 01:27:47.739
But the fact is...

01:27:47.839 --> 01:27:50.099
I love you.

01:27:50.199 --> 01:27:53.899
And somewhere in your confused,
black, little criminal's heart,

01:27:53.999 --> 01:27:55.724
you care for me.

01:27:55.879 --> 01:27:58.099
I'm marrying Brice Catledge.

01:27:58.199 --> 01:27:59.899
You advised me to.

01:27:59.999 --> 01:28:01.579
You must never take my advice.

01:28:01.679 --> 01:28:02.619
I'm a major eccentric.

01:28:02.719 --> 01:28:04.099
You know, Brice adores me,

01:28:04.199 --> 01:28:07.379
and he offers me a life of travel

01:28:07.479 --> 01:28:10.259
- and excitement and high living.
- No, no,

01:28:10.359 --> 01:28:12.339
he worships you, and you
don't want to be worshiped.

01:28:12.439 --> 01:28:13.659
You'll be bored.

01:28:13.759 --> 01:28:15.659
Sailing to the Greek Islands?

01:28:15.759 --> 01:28:17.179
And Bora-Bora?

01:28:17.279 --> 01:28:19.259
Well, they're just,
they're just rocks in the ocean!

01:28:19.359 --> 01:28:20.899
It's who you go with!

01:28:20.999 --> 01:28:22.859
Do you want to spend the
rest of your life with a man

01:28:22.959 --> 01:28:26.299
who plays the ukulele
and croons to you?

01:28:26.399 --> 01:28:29.000
You know I like you
very much, Stanley.

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:32.849
I even began falling
in love with you.

01:28:33.959 --> 01:28:38.259
But when you went on to show
me how irrational it was,

01:28:38.359 --> 01:28:40.139
and then you proved it

01:28:40.239 --> 01:28:42.179
- with geometrical logic.
- No...

01:28:42.279 --> 01:28:44.619
Geometry was never my strong subject.

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:47.459
After all, what can you offer me?

01:28:47.559 --> 01:28:49.099
Grumpy moods?

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:50.779
Insults?

01:28:50.879 --> 01:28:55.619
Pessimistic grumbling about
how awful life is for all of us?

01:28:55.719 --> 01:28:57.499
Well, around you, I'm not gloomy.

01:28:57.599 --> 01:28:59.499
That's only because I fooled you

01:28:59.599 --> 01:29:02.419
into thinking that there's more
to life than meets the eye.

01:29:02.519 --> 01:29:05.179
No, no, I have not lost my pessimism,

01:29:05.279 --> 01:29:09.979
but you are like an oasis
in the grim desert.

01:29:10.079 --> 01:29:12.619
And as far as what I can offer you,

01:29:12.719 --> 01:29:15.923
life with a brilliant
and witty genius.

01:29:17.279 --> 01:29:18.219
I have to go.

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:20.059
No, this is your last offer.

01:29:20.159 --> 01:29:21.659
You must not be an ingrate.

01:29:21.759 --> 01:29:22.859
Good-bye, Stanley.

01:29:22.959 --> 01:29:25.179
I will not stand around here,
cap in hand,

01:29:25.279 --> 01:29:28.847
waiting for some halfpenny
con artist to be my bride!

01:29:29.439 --> 01:29:30.739
This is it. You don't agree now,

01:29:30.839 --> 01:29:32.779
offer's off the table.

01:29:32.879 --> 01:29:34.019
Do you hear me?

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:35.779
You irritating Lilliputian!

01:29:35.879 --> 01:29:39.003
You're throwing away your
passport to paradise!

01:29:40.439 --> 01:29:42.179
Can you forgive me, Stanley?

01:29:42.279 --> 01:29:44.219
I have forgiven you, Howard,

01:29:44.319 --> 01:29:46.339
as I've forgiven Sophie.

01:29:46.439 --> 01:29:49.219
I agree, I needed a pie in the face.

01:29:49.319 --> 01:29:51.499
Well, I saw a side of you in
this I've never seen before.

01:29:51.599 --> 01:29:53.819
It was refreshing.

01:29:53.919 --> 01:29:57.859
Even now, Sophie's smile
still penetrates my soul.

01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:00.259
Now you believe we have souls?

01:30:00.359 --> 01:30:02.379
No, I believe each of
us must find a reason

01:30:02.479 --> 01:30:04.219
to truly embrace life,

01:30:04.319 --> 01:30:06.859
and for me, Sophie is that reason.

01:30:06.959 --> 01:30:09.499
Well, if nothing else,
it's made you certain

01:30:09.599 --> 01:30:11.939
it would've been a
mistake to marry Olivia.

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:14.179
I spoke to Olivia on the telephone.

01:30:14.279 --> 01:30:16.579
She's much less upset
than I'd anticipated.

01:30:16.679 --> 01:30:20.219
Very calm, very reasonable.

01:30:20.319 --> 01:30:21.819
She's in the Galapagos.

01:30:21.919 --> 01:30:24.219
She said she was disappointed,

01:30:24.319 --> 01:30:26.579
but she understood that
these things happen,

01:30:26.679 --> 01:30:29.419
and if I was still going to feel
this way when I returned,

01:30:29.519 --> 01:30:31.499
it's much better we found out now.

01:30:31.599 --> 01:30:33.859
What a lovely, rational human being.

01:30:33.959 --> 01:30:35.379
I should look her up.

01:30:35.479 --> 01:30:38.569
She's bright, pretty,
she likes magicians.

01:31:17.559 --> 01:31:19.779
Well, how did it go?

01:31:19.879 --> 01:31:22.446
Can you believe she turned me down?

01:31:23.519 --> 01:31:25.608
Poor Stanley.

01:31:25.759 --> 01:31:28.299
That scamp could've had me,

01:31:28.399 --> 01:31:31.019
but instead, she chose
Brice Catledge.

01:31:31.119 --> 01:31:34.459
Well, he is very rich
and good-looking.

01:31:34.559 --> 01:31:35.899
She'd have been happier with me.

01:31:35.999 --> 01:31:38.699
So in the end, you lost her.

01:31:38.799 --> 01:31:41.219
It's sad, because...

01:31:41.319 --> 01:31:43.760
There really was
something between us.

01:31:44.959 --> 01:31:48.019
Some chemistry. Some magic.

01:31:48.119 --> 01:31:51.659
And I say chemistry
or magic because...

01:31:51.759 --> 01:31:54.819
I believe I actually loved
her from the first...

01:31:54.919 --> 01:31:56.859
First moment I laid eyes on her.

01:31:56.959 --> 01:32:00.179
Well, love at first sight is
a kind of magic, isn't it?

01:32:00.279 --> 01:32:02.179
You need a drink. What will you have?

01:32:02.279 --> 01:32:03.765
A scotch, please.

01:32:04.919 --> 01:32:06.939
In the end, she proved to be a fool.

01:32:07.039 --> 01:32:10.059
You mean to choose that handsome
young millionaire over you?

01:32:10.159 --> 01:32:12.379
Well, she may come to her senses.

01:32:12.479 --> 01:32:15.579
Women do change their
mind about such things.

01:32:15.679 --> 01:32:18.459
Well, it's too late...
I've taken the offer off the table.

01:32:18.559 --> 01:32:21.019
I'll not let myself be
pushed around by big eyes

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:23.526
and a smile.

01:32:25.599 --> 01:32:27.801
Although she's much more.

01:32:29.079 --> 01:32:31.059
But she had her chance,
and she said no.

01:32:31.159 --> 01:32:34.659
You mean if she changed her mind,
you wouldn't accept her?

01:32:34.759 --> 01:32:35.979
It's too late.

01:32:36.079 --> 01:32:38.281
You can't be that stubborn.

01:32:40.959 --> 01:32:45.219
Well, I suppose if she woke
up and realized how happy

01:32:45.319 --> 01:32:46.659
she'd be with me,

01:32:46.759 --> 01:32:49.360
how much more fun she'd have in life,

01:32:50.559 --> 01:32:52.841
how much I'd come to love her.

01:32:53.479 --> 01:32:55.219
She gave nothing back.

01:32:55.319 --> 01:32:58.443
She gave you no sign
at all that she cared?

01:32:59.959 --> 01:33:03.139
If she'd given me a sign,

01:33:03.239 --> 01:33:06.779
I'd have taken her in
my arms, carried her off

01:33:06.879 --> 01:33:09.081
and married her.

01:33:10.319 --> 01:33:13.409
All I was looking for was one sign.

01:33:21.879 --> 01:33:23.729
Sophie?

01:33:31.239 --> 01:33:33.089
Will you marry me?
