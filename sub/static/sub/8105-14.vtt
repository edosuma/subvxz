WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.879
- Two spades.
- Three hearts.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.507
It's all yours.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.801
I'm void.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.512
And that's five.

00:13.639 --> 00:16.808
And that's six. Not bad.

00:17.059 --> 00:20.812
On a slam contract, you normally
wanna play your winners early.

00:20.938 --> 00:24.148
- Sorry, Daddy.
- You're learning. You're doing fine.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.151
Connie Gilman's a good player.
And a widow.

00:27.277 --> 00:31.114
I should take her out
because she can play bridge.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.324
You're a true romantic.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.412
You should ask somebody out.
You think Cecile's not dating yet?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.580
Cecile was dating before she left.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.665
Oh, shut up, Marv.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.710
Nope. I have a partner
and she's doing great.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.712
Amy should be out having fun.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.716
- I'm having fun.
- Yeah.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.177
Look like you're having
the time of your life.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.353
One no trump.

01:04.189 --> 01:08.568
I-I'm just a little nauseous.
I think I ate too much.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.655
- Can we take a break?
- Of course. Excuse us.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.744
- What did you eat?
- Nothing weird.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.787
- Have you been drinking?
- No, Dad, you know...

01:19.913 --> 01:21.789
Because I don't mind if you...

01:22.624 --> 01:27.754
Dad?

01:28.547 --> 01:30.465
Dad? What are you doing?

01:35.012 --> 01:37.597
You're scaring me! It hurts! Let go!

01:38.056 --> 01:39.766
What are you doing?

01:40.684 --> 01:41.851
Henry!

01:43.395 --> 01:45.480
Henry, let go of her!

01:47.274 --> 01:50.359
The occasional drink
doesn't bother me, but...

01:52.529 --> 01:54.655
- What?
- Are you okay?

01:54.782 --> 01:56.407
What's the matter?

02:38.951 --> 02:41.828
You had what's called
an absence seizure.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.579
Anything like that happen to you before?

02:43.705 --> 02:44.914
No, nothing.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.209
He's been really healthy.
He jogs, he eats right, he...

02:48.335 --> 02:51.087
Well, I did have a headache last Sunday.

02:51.213 --> 02:55.174
And for the past two years
I've been getting acid reflux a lot,

02:55.300 --> 02:58.761
and I thought that antacids
were all I needed.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.388
Should I have come in sooner?

03:00.514 --> 03:02.390
For acid reflux and a headache?

03:07.646 --> 03:11.649
Well, I... You know, I hear
the coffee downstairs is really good.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.734
Could you get me a cup, honey?

03:17.406 --> 03:19.824
Would you mind closing the blinds?

03:24.663 --> 03:27.748
His right testicle
was almost twice as big as his left.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.751
- Cool.
- It's probably testicular cancer.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.962
No. That's impossible.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.213
The symptoms all indicate...

03:34.339 --> 03:36.424
The shoes aren't right.

03:38.802 --> 03:41.554
Here's how testicular cancer
would manifest itself.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.807
First, the patient would get
the exact symptoms that he's got.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.726
Then Foreman would examine him.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.519
Then he'd suspect testicular cancer

03:48.645 --> 03:50.688
on account of the symptoms
being so perfect.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.566
Then he'd stick a needle in it,
then he'd call a surgeon.

03:53.692 --> 03:57.612
And while that guy operates,
the rest of us would be out bowling.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.157
And, since we're not
wearing bowling shoes,

04:01.283 --> 04:03.492
the disease obviously
did not progress in that fashion.

04:03.619 --> 04:06.370
LP showed some white cells.
But his MRI's clean.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.874
Sure. If you call a microabcess
in his brain "clean."

04:12.628 --> 04:13.586
What, you don't trust me?

04:13.712 --> 04:16.088
Are you're talking
about the left temporal lobe?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.673
Neat, you can see through my hand.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.967
- It's just a shadow.
- Or it's an infection.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.844
When guys have brain-crotch problems

04:21.970 --> 04:24.805
it's usually the result of using
one too much and the other too little.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.934
Blood and urine were negative
for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.977
So treat him for all three, stat.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.355
Negative means he doesn't have it.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.357
No, negative means
he probably doesn't have it,

04:34.483 --> 04:35.983
which means he probably has cancer.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.152
I thought we were wearing
the wrong shoes for cancer.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.821
We're wearing the wrong
shoes for testicular cancer.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.575
They're perfect for lymphoma.
Except Chase's, they're just goofy.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.036
Lymphoma could cause infiltrates

04:47.162 --> 04:48.871
in his reproductive organs
and his brain.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.374
If it's this advanced,
he's dead no matter what we do.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.961
So give him the STD meds
and hope the tests were wrong.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.054
Who's the lucky woman?

05:05.180 --> 05:06.681
My wife.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.058
No, I don't wanna know
who gets the chocolates,

05:09.184 --> 05:11.894
I wanna know
who you're having the affair with.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.563
He fell on his head as a child. Tragic.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.941
Norwegian chocolate.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.194
Frankly, you buy that stuff,
the terrorists win.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.365
Some people bottle up their feelings,
have them come out as physical pain.

05:24.491 --> 05:28.160
Healthy human beings express feelings,
such as affection, by giving gifts.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.079
Gifts express guilt.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.415
The more expensive the expression,
the deeper the guilt.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.916
That's a $12 box.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.836
Either you haven't slept with her yet
or she wasn't that good.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.796
It's not all about sex, House.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.840
Really? When did that change?

05:44.553 --> 05:46.595
I wanna get Depo-Provera.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.267
Actually, at your age,
as long as you're careful,

05:51.393 --> 05:53.769
the risk of you getting pregnant
is pretty limited.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.772
Yeah, but it would calm me down, right?
If I get a high enough dose.

05:56.898 --> 06:01.652
You mean "calm" as in a peaceful lake
on a cool summer evening?

06:01.778 --> 06:05.406
Or in the lesser-used meaning
of nothing can ever bother you again

06:05.532 --> 06:07.283
because life has absolutely no meaning.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.578
High dose of Depo-Provera
will chemically castrate you.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.163
Yeah.

06:16.251 --> 06:19.295
Okay, I'm gonna get up to leave now.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.422
I'm gonna walk to that door,
turn the handle,

06:21.548 --> 06:24.633
and then you're suddenly gonna decide
that you have to tell me the truth.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.136
I'm gonna have to turn around,
come all the way back.

06:27.262 --> 06:32.183
You see, the thing is, my leg hurts. Can
we cut the walking out of the equation?

06:32.309 --> 06:34.060
I love cows.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.151
Any particular variety?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.945
Guernseys? Holsteins?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.447
Which are the black and white ones?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.282
Oh, God.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.077
I pass a farm on my way to school.

06:51.578 --> 06:56.123
And they're so beautiful,
they're so majestic, I dream about them.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.921
Leather shoes, hamburgers.
How could anybody do that to a cow?

07:02.047 --> 07:04.882
Make love, not belts. That's beautiful.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.218
- I haven't actually...
- Relax.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.553
This is something we doctors
deal with all the time.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.057
I'm gonna write you the name of a drug.
You don't need a prescription.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.809
And it looks just like Depo-Provera.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.436
- But does it do the same thing?
- Oh, God, no.

07:17.562 --> 07:21.690
That stuff has all sorts of nasty
side effects. It's real medicine.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.778
No, this is all you need. Your frat
buddies will be completely fooled.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.823
You can tell them
how appalled the doctor was.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.491
Lots of laughs.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.662
We think you may have
a sexually transmitted disease.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.205
No. It's not possible.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.166
Sir, maybe we should speak in private?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.709
Have you tested him for this?

07:40.836 --> 07:41.877
The tests were negative.

07:42.003 --> 07:45.923
Well, then it's not that.
So, what else could it be?

07:46.883 --> 07:47.925
Nothing good.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.970
If you've been having sex
you have to tell me.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.807
I have not had sex since my divorce!

07:58.270 --> 08:02.273
I didn't ask him to take the medicine.
I asked you to give him the medicine.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.775
- He hasn't had sex in over a year.
- He's lying.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.360
He knows what's at stake.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.863
We should start treating him
for lymphoma right away.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.531
Maybe if we hit him hard and fast.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.866
Wilson!

08:12.200 --> 08:13.993
How long can you go without sex?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.786
How long can you go
without annoying people?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.872
No, seriously. A week, a month?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.206
I'm not having an affair!

08:19.332 --> 08:20.708
I didn't say you were.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.544
Not in this conversation.
We're talking about a patient.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.630
People have impulse control.
We don't need sex.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.384
Well, not like air. But as
a biological imperative, sure we do.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.095
There's two things we get stupid for:
money and sex.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.764
And since money
rarely enters the bloodstream...

08:35.891 --> 08:38.350
Was his daughter in the room
when you asked if he'd had sex?

08:38.476 --> 08:41.228
I told him we could talk privately,
he didn't care if she was there.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.190
It's almost noon.
The little girl would go to lunch.

08:44.316 --> 08:48.235
As soon as she's out the door, you're
gonna get paged. Then you page me.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.533
Lunch is early, huh?

09:01.374 --> 09:04.543
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.005
I hear you'd rather die
than admit you had sex.

09:09.424 --> 09:14.386
- Sorry. I couldn't tell my daughter.
- Right. Because she's, what, 22?

09:14.512 --> 09:16.055
I slept with her mom.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.851
She probably knows
that's happened already.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.229
Roll over.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.775
My wife had an affair. I forgave her.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.696
She had another affair
and I forgave her again.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.574
Amy thinks I was an idiot.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.827
So smart.
You must be very proud. Roll over.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.664
I assume you've been in love.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.833
Is that the one
that makes your pants feel funny?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.169
I'm starting you
on a cocktail of STD meds.

09:47.295 --> 09:51.966
Amy is just getting over it.
She barely spoke to her mom for months

09:52.092 --> 09:54.593
and if she thought
that it was happening again,

09:54.719 --> 09:56.762
that that's why I got sick...

10:00.809 --> 10:02.393
We just happened to be

10:02.519 --> 10:06.313
at the same Italian
cheese-tasting thing.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.275
Cheese is the devil's plaything.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.652
It was just the one night.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.154
You're obviously completely over her.

10:14.281 --> 10:18.325
Amy thinks love leads you
to make stupid choices.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.744
You're certainly setting
a good example for her.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.496
Yeah. She just doesn't get it.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.707
If you're not prepared to look stupid,

10:24.833 --> 10:27.918
then nothing great
is ever gonna happen, right?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.171
On the other hand,

10:31.298 --> 10:34.800
I guess your testicles
aren't going to explode, either.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.763
Dad.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.349
Is everything okay?

10:43.435 --> 10:46.061
I have a sexually transmitted disease.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.814
How is that possible?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.359
He met a woman in church.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.449
Does she play bridge?

10:58.575 --> 10:59.867
Does she...

11:04.080 --> 11:07.041
Crash cart! Oh, God!

11:10.670 --> 11:13.088
- Is this another seizure?
- Shut up!

11:13.631 --> 11:14.965
Coming in!

11:16.009 --> 11:17.092
Oh, God!

11:17.218 --> 11:18.177
Here you go.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.429
Forty milligrams furosemide.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.389
Knock him out.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.807
It's in.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.526
How would an STD do this?

11:34.778 --> 11:36.236
It wouldn't.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.535
It was flash pulmonary edema.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.455
We took a liter of fluid off
but the problem wasn't with his lungs.

11:46.581 --> 11:50.125
It's his heart. There are vegetations
obstructing his mitral valve.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.295
It's not an STD.
Lymphoma wouldn't erupt that suddenly.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.505
So what is it then?

11:54.631 --> 11:58.175
A disease that attacks his brain,
heart and testicles.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.345
- I think Byron wrote about that.
- Could be psittacosis.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.931
Chlamydia cultures
would've come back positive.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.891
Strep viridians can hit the heart.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.477
Wouldn't mess
with the reproductive system.

12:08.603 --> 12:13.190
Maybe things aren't so nicely connected.
He's 65.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.067
We could be looking at multiple
systems

12:15.193 --> 12:17.653
just starting
to break down independently.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.572
Way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

12:20.698 --> 12:24.326
He's had acid reflux for years,
it can't be relevant.

12:24.452 --> 12:28.288
Seems there are other ways to kill
people besides having sex with them.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.508
You don't need this so much.

12:41.010 --> 12:45.097
Problem is not your lungs,
it's your heart.

12:47.851 --> 12:52.646
That Italian cheese thing at the church,
what sort of cheese?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.022
Why do you need to know?

12:54.149 --> 12:56.150
I'm having a fondue party.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.528
- Was it sheep cheese?
- Might have been, why?

12:59.654 --> 13:01.488
- Was it soft?
- Yeah.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.283
- Taste like crap?
- Yeah, bitter.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.784
Taste like this?

13:08.496 --> 13:10.456
Yeah, but how did you...

13:10.582 --> 13:12.791
That was regular low-fat American.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.043
I added some bacteria for flavor.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.503
You fed him bacteria?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.046
It's pretty much on everything.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.425
Especially the unpasteurized sheep
cheese they make in the Alps.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.469
That stuff will give you brucellosis.

13:23.595 --> 13:27.139
Key to a long life:
exotic women and boring cheese.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.725
I'm gonna start you
on rifampin and doxycycline.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.393
Doesn't make any sense.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.396
I mean, nobody else
at the church got sick.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.942
99.9% of Christians
have so much acid in their stomach,

13:39.068 --> 13:41.195
they become churning cauldrons
of death

13:41.321 --> 13:43.739
for all those nasty little
brucellosis bugs.

13:43.865 --> 13:46.783
But you were taking antacids
for your acid reflux.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.244
So that turns your digestive tract

13:49.370 --> 13:53.248
into a pleasant scenic river
for all those bacterial tourists.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.756
You sure you're right?

14:00.882 --> 14:02.341
Absolutely. Your socks don't match.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.343
Which means you got up
and got dressed in the dark,

14:04.469 --> 14:06.094
which means you don't wanna
wake your wife,

14:06.221 --> 14:08.388
which means you don't wanna
talk to her, which means...

14:08.515 --> 14:09.932
I was referring to your patient.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.099
Oh, that.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.727
No. Come on, I'm basing it on cheese.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.395
How long before you get the tests back?

14:15.522 --> 14:16.855
Well, we'll know before that.

14:16.981 --> 14:20.067
If I'm wrong, he'll just keep getting
worse and slowly die.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.112
And if I'm right, either we caught it
in time and he gets better,

14:24.239 --> 14:27.741
or we didn't, and he goes
into cardiac arrest at any moment.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.163
Paddles!

14:38.253 --> 14:41.088
Charging. Two-fifty. Clear!

14:42.257 --> 14:44.675
Charging! Three hundred! Clear!

14:45.301 --> 14:48.011
Charging! Three-sixty! Clear!

14:48.137 --> 14:49.596
Epinephrine.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.822
- You gonna tell her?
- That you suspect an affair?

15:06.948 --> 15:09.157
Sure. Well, she already hates you,
why not?

15:09.284 --> 15:12.369
Because you think getting it off
your chest will let you sleep better.

15:12.495 --> 15:15.497
It won't. You'll end up sleeping
on my lumpy couch.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.623
There's nothing to tell.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.917
Why are you playing foosball here
at 8:00 at night?

15:19.043 --> 15:21.753
You always wanna simplify everything.

15:21.879 --> 15:25.549
Boil it down to nice, easy equations.
Nice, easy answers.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.428
Go home and have sex with your wife.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.018
His heart is back in sinus rhythm.
There's a lot of damage, though.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.478
It was brucellosis,
but we got to it too late.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.647
The vegetation broke off
in his main coronary artery

15:40.773 --> 15:42.024
and caused an infarction.

15:42.150 --> 15:46.194
His heart muscle's half dead.
He'll be lucky to last a week.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.488
Other than that, how's he doing?

15:51.326 --> 15:52.534
Seriously.

15:52.660 --> 15:57.289
His brain, testicle, lungs, tonsils,
how's all that other stuff doing?

15:58.374 --> 16:01.877
His brain is clear now
and so is the genito-urinary tract

16:02.003 --> 16:04.212
and his kidney function is good.

16:04.339 --> 16:08.175
So, all he needs is a heart
and he's out of here.

16:11.554 --> 16:14.056
He's a prime candidate
for transplant.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.933
Doesn't smoke, drinks moderately.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.103
His tox screen was negative
for illegal drugs and legal ones.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.689
Surveillance blood cultures show
absolutely no sign

16:22.815 --> 16:24.524
of any lingering brucella bacteria.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.610
He's 66 years old.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.237
He told me he was 65.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.697
Liar. I'm out of here.

16:30.823 --> 16:35.035
There is an inverse correlation
between patient age and success rates.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.370
He's in excellent health.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.123
This was his first hospitalization
since breaking his leg at 23.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.833
Or 22, I'm not sure anymore.

16:41.959 --> 16:45.045
If this patient were to survive
the operation,

16:45.296 --> 16:46.755
he'd get another, what,

16:46.881 --> 16:50.300
five, 10, maybe 20 years
if he's very lucky?

16:50.426 --> 16:54.054
So you're saying that old people
aren't as worth saving as young people?

16:54.180 --> 16:56.807
He's saying that hearts
are a scarce resource.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.518
- We have to choose criteria...
- No, I get it.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.354
Women live longer,
so they should get preference, right?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.856
And African-Americans,
they die a lot younger,

17:04.982 --> 17:06.149
so to hell with them.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.902
What, you think you're gonna
win me over by calling me a racist?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.113
If the test is who gets
to use it the longest,

17:11.239 --> 17:13.323
you can either be a racist
or a hypocrite.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.743
Your patient had a life, a family.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.287
We've got 18-year-old kids who...

17:19.414 --> 17:21.415
How old are you, Doctor?

17:21.582 --> 17:24.418
When do we get to toss you
on an ice floe?

17:24.627 --> 17:26.211
And thank you, Dr. House.

17:26.337 --> 17:29.005
Unless anybody else
has any further questions,

17:29.132 --> 17:31.675
we will now go into private session.

17:32.176 --> 17:36.388
Oh, I'm on pins and needles.
I wonder how you'll decide.

17:41.310 --> 17:45.105
The Nets just won their third game
in a row, beat the Lakers.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.777
I'm sorry.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.738
They voted no.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.825
So,

17:57.994 --> 17:59.077
when

18:00.830 --> 18:02.330
will I die?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.461
You might have a week.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.326
I wrote a letter
to the Board of Directors

18:39.452 --> 18:41.703
appealing the transplant
committee's decision.

18:41.829 --> 18:45.373
I'm alleging bias against you
clouded their medical judgment.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.542
- I need you to sign.
- They made the right call.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.711
You don't believe that.
You told the committee...

18:49.837 --> 18:52.172
I was advocating for my patient.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.388
Then why are you...

19:00.515 --> 19:02.557
Advocating for my patient.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.768
I've got that clinic duty.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.396
I need you to get me the files
on everybody who dies here today.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.941
You really think this thing
will change their decision?

19:11.067 --> 19:12.192
Nope.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.703
I think I broke my ankle.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.872
I was kicked. By a hoof.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.210
I'm so in love. She was so beautiful.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.587
Which one?
One of the black and white ones,

19:32.713 --> 19:35.340
- I'm not sure what type...
- Not which type, which one?

19:35.466 --> 19:36.883
I want a name.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.512
- Why would it have a name?
- Not "it." "She." Or "he."

19:40.638 --> 19:42.973
I wanna know her dreams, her hopes.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.224
It's a cow.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.686
Hey, I'm not the one
who said he was in love.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.315
People who actually have
this condition rationalize it.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.861
They dismiss it, they don't elevate it
to the level of poetry.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.113
Plus there's a wooden splinter in there.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.448
So, either you hit yourself
with a two-by-four,

20:00.575 --> 20:02.200
or Elsie has a peg leg.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.202
I'm off duty at 6:00.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.163
Give yourself another whack,
come back and scam somebody else.

20:07.290 --> 20:11.710
I'm sick! And you're a doctor,
you have a duty to help me.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.462
Technically,
I don't have to treat anybody

20:14.589 --> 20:20.051
before running a series of painful
and often humiliating tests.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.516
Whatever you need.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.935
90-year-old woman died of pneumonia.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.813
Unless she has a bionic heart,
what's next?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.941
Baby died in the ICU...

20:35.067 --> 20:38.862
Babies are useless. They got hearts
the size of ping-pong balls. Next.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.698
A 40-year-old male.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.200
- Yes?
- Heart attack.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.663
If you really cared about me,
you'd find me a better corpse.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.541
There's no other deaths. There's one
woman who was in a car accident.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.876
Bad one, I hope.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.170
The organ procurement people
have been notified.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.296
Give me her file.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.840
It's in the ER,
they're still working on her.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.509
Age? About 40.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.219
Young, damn.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.429
Young is good.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.514
Smoker? Don't know.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.558
- Find out.
- She's still alive.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.560
Even if we get on the list,
we can't go near her...

21:10.686 --> 21:11.853
Overweight?

21:12.229 --> 21:13.855
She's on the hefty side.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.399
Excellent. Our odds just went up.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.318
What odds? What is this?

21:18.444 --> 21:21.821
60% of potential donor hearts
get tossed in the trash

21:21.948 --> 21:23.740
because there's something
wrong with them.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.492
With fat people, it's closer to 80.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.243
But if her heart's no good, then...

21:27.370 --> 21:30.789
Big fat, sloppy heart beats
no heart at all.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.851
- Are you Mr. Neuberger?
- Yes.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.938
I'm Dr. House. I need to ask you
a few questions about your wife.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.106
Is she gonna be okay?

21:56.232 --> 21:58.066
I'm afraid I don't know that.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.901
Could you tell me about her accident?

22:00.027 --> 22:03.530
They think she fell asleep, went off
the road. That's all they told me.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.490
Any problems with her health
up until now?

22:05.616 --> 22:06.658
Why?

22:08.035 --> 22:09.953
Please, it's important.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.456
She had a fever today,
but otherwise she was...

22:13.582 --> 22:16.334
- How high?
- About 101.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.714
She hasn't missed a day
of teaching in years.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.591
And I should've made her stay home.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.219
Any other symptoms?

22:26.929 --> 22:29.639
A stomachache. Who cares?
She was in a car crash!

22:29.765 --> 22:31.725
- Mr. Neuberger? Yeah?
- My name's Ellen Stambler.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.436
I'm the organ procurement coordinator
for southern New Jersey.

22:34.562 --> 22:38.648
I just want to assure you that we'll
treat her organs with care and dignity.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.985
Her organs?

22:45.489 --> 22:46.865
Laura died?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.909
I'm sorry, I thought...

22:51.287 --> 22:53.329
She was just pronounced dead.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.540
I thought he was telling you.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.375
I didn't know.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.879
You should never make assumptions.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.467
What did you want from me?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.055
I'm sorry for your loss.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.766
But I need your wife's heart.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.861
The organ procurement coordinator
just left the hospital.

23:24.987 --> 23:28.364
Means we got lucky.
Either that or she's getting lunch.

23:28.491 --> 23:31.493
Dead woman's last name
have a "U" or a "W"?

23:31.619 --> 23:33.870
You're hacking into
a confidential patient file?

23:33.996 --> 23:35.705
Is that a problem for you?

23:35.831 --> 23:37.624
It's a "U". N-E-U.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.001
Berger.

23:43.172 --> 23:47.383
Three minutes ago, her organs
were officially declared "not viable."

23:47.510 --> 23:49.719
Time to go dumpster diving.

23:58.813 --> 23:59.854
Hey!

23:59.980 --> 24:02.899
She's got Hepatitis C.
Her ALTs are three times normal.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.819
With Henry's immune system down,
an infected heart will kill him.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.570
Fortunately, she didn't have Hep C.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.989
- She tested positive.
- Her history says otherwise.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.575
Her husband told me she
was running a fever with stomach pains,

24:12.701 --> 24:14.702
not symptomatic of Hep C.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.319
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

24:48.445 --> 24:50.446
Hey, what are you doing?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.448
Again, sorry.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.951
But we need to talk.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.372
Mr. Neuberger has every right
to take his wife off the ventilator.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.374
His wife signed an organ donor card.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.544
Which became invalid
when her organs were turned down.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.338
I can use them! I just need some time.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.299
Committee says
they won't take her heart.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.718
Another committee says
a guy can't have a heart.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.303
It's a marriage made in heaven.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.180
I could find a surgical team
that can do this,

25:15.306 --> 25:18.057
classify it as experimental.
It's not gonna screw with their numbers.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.560
This is what she wanted.
She wanted her organs to help other...

25:20.686 --> 25:22.562
She never wanted to be kept alive
on a ventilator!

25:22.688 --> 25:24.564
She's not, she's dead!

25:24.690 --> 25:27.150
She's not in pain, she's not suffering,

25:27.276 --> 25:29.527
it's just her meat
we're dealing with here.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.449
- This is my wife.
- Not anymore.

25:34.575 --> 25:37.577
She deserves some respect, some dignity.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.287
- I respect the living.
- Right!

25:39.413 --> 25:41.998
That is why you made me think
that you were her doctor,

25:42.124 --> 25:44.918
made me believe that maybe
there was some hope.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.545
- I never said that I was her doctor.
- Fine! You didn't lie,

25:47.671 --> 25:49.589
but you sure as hell
didn't give me any respect.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.883
I'm taking her off the machines. Now.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.178
Nicely played.

25:55.304 --> 25:56.387
It's not over.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.188
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Neuberger?

26:05.648 --> 26:07.148
Yeah, why?

26:07.274 --> 26:08.691
I'm Amy Arrington.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.527
I wanted to thank you.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.704
This girl's father will die
by next weekend

26:21.830 --> 26:23.623
unless he gets your wife's heart.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.376
House, don't you think
that's a little manipulative?

26:26.502 --> 26:29.295
No. It's hugely manipulative.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.214
You're an ass.

26:31.340 --> 26:34.467
Hey, listen!
You take your wife off life support

26:34.593 --> 26:37.262
and I'll have forgotten about this
in two weeks.

26:37.388 --> 26:38.638
Gail here, on the other hand...

26:38.764 --> 26:41.140
- Amy.
- Whatever.

26:42.601 --> 26:46.646
You're mad at me. Fine, I get that.
Take it out on me, not on her.

27:03.455 --> 27:07.542
Fine. Your dad can have her heart.

27:29.315 --> 27:34.193
Fever, stomach pain,
raised liver enzymes.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.611
She's sick.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.822
Worse than that, she's dead.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.825
My point is, even if it's not Hep C,
it's something.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.201
They turned her down as a donor

27:42.328 --> 27:44.912
because if we put that heart
into someone, they won't survive.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.706
Whatever made her sick will kill him!

27:46.832 --> 27:48.833
Yeah. So what is it?

27:49.376 --> 27:50.543
The enzymes indicate...

27:50.669 --> 27:53.338
You want us to do a differential
diagnosis on a dead person?

27:53.464 --> 27:54.547
We're going to cure her.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.049
We're going to cure death?

27:58.177 --> 27:59.510
Doubt it.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.763
Just wanna get the infection
out of her heart

28:01.889 --> 28:03.389
before we get the heart out of her.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.183
The fever indicates an infection.

28:05.309 --> 28:08.353
She probably has Hep C
and a bad case of the flu.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.188
Let's assume, just for fun,

28:10.314 --> 28:13.107
that the answer is something
that might be helpful.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.985
Fever and belly pain.
Could be a gall bladder infection.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.653
Like that.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.405
Do an MRI, stat.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.457
You really don't need to be here.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.585
I assume House is a great doctor.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.754
Why would you assume that?

28:34.880 --> 28:39.217
Because, when you're that big a jerk,
you're either great or unemployed.

28:42.346 --> 28:43.930
No sign
of gall bladder infection.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.015
- But there was a cyst.
- Perfectly round.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.726
Hep C wouldn't cause...
The question was never "Is it Hep C?"

28:48.852 --> 28:51.813
The question was,
"Given that it's not Hep C, what is it?"

28:51.939 --> 28:53.898
- Adenoma?
- Not solid enough.

28:54.024 --> 28:57.735
- Cavernous hemangioma?
- Not vascular enough.

28:58.195 --> 29:02.073
What if she was sloppy
about washing her hands after pooping?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.367
Amoeba infection?

29:04.493 --> 29:07.370
If the amebiasis started in her liver,
then spread to her blood,

29:07.496 --> 29:10.248
that would explain all her symptoms,
except for the crushed skull.

29:10.374 --> 29:12.125
But I'm assuming
that's from the car crash.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.085
I'll start her on paromomycin
and chloroquine.

29:14.211 --> 29:15.461
Ten grams each.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.339
That's 20 times the normal dose.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.968
Right, so we'll destroy her retinas
and damage her hearing.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.971
Whoever wants those parts
is having a very bad day.

29:25.097 --> 29:28.349
Couple hours on the meds,
she'll be feeling great.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.149
I got your labs.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.776
- Do you eat guinea pigs?
- No.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.613
How about hamsters or mice? Humans?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.407
What are you talking about?

29:44.533 --> 29:45.992
Is something wrong with me?

29:46.118 --> 29:47.535
Absolutely nothing.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.370
Your blood work is perfect.

29:49.496 --> 29:53.249
You have lots of vitamins,
minerals, all kinds of proteins,

29:53.667 --> 29:58.087
including a little something
I like to call bovine serum albumin

29:58.213 --> 30:03.301
which you get from eating
the animals mentioned. Or cow.

30:04.595 --> 30:07.388
You don't really worship cows.

30:07.514 --> 30:10.266
So I have to wonder,
what could be more humiliating

30:10.392 --> 30:14.645
than someone calling your girlfriend
a cow and not being metaphorical?

30:29.786 --> 30:31.829
- Nice.
- That's my mom.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.710
Either that's a very old photograph
or it's your stepmom.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.796
She goes around the house
in a bikini. Or less.

30:40.923 --> 30:42.673
I can't stop thinking about her.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.176
My dad's in Europe. I'll be watching TV,

30:45.302 --> 30:48.304
she'll give me a massage.
I can't walk for an hour.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.681
Still. Cows?

30:50.807 --> 30:51.849
She's my mother!

30:51.975 --> 30:53.059
Step.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.688
Please? I just need the medicine
for three months

30:57.814 --> 31:00.525
until I graduate
and I move out of the house.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.111
Please.

31:06.657 --> 31:09.534
You're not gonna have any fun
at graduation.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.663
Keep up the good work.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.581
Your shirt is ironed.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.417
That means
you haven't told your wife anything.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.212
Let's say you're right.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.090
You're saying I'm right?

31:24.216 --> 31:26.926
No, "let" is saying.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.137
Does it occur to you that
maybe there's some deeper guidance

31:30.264 --> 31:31.847
than "keep your mouth shut"?

31:31.974 --> 31:35.935
That maybe a friend might value
concern over glibness?

31:36.061 --> 31:37.562
That maybe...

31:40.232 --> 31:41.607
Maybe I'm going through something

31:41.733 --> 31:44.944
that I need to have
an actual conversation about?

31:50.200 --> 31:53.578
Does it occur to you that
if you need that kind of a friend,

31:53.704 --> 31:56.330
you may have made some deeper errors?

32:05.132 --> 32:08.843
Her heartbeat's irregular.
Looks like global hypokinesis.

32:14.808 --> 32:16.350
Stop the meds.

32:18.729 --> 32:19.812
You're giving up?

32:19.938 --> 32:22.690
Either we're wrong
and her heart is unusable,

32:22.816 --> 32:24.859
or we're right,
but the treatment we have

32:24.985 --> 32:26.944
to give her will make
her heart unusable.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.157
I'm sorry. You can pull the plug now.

32:32.034 --> 32:33.326
Find me another body.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.453
That fat guy on Ortho service
didn't look so hot.

32:35.579 --> 32:36.621
No!

32:37.956 --> 32:39.582
She's not ready.

32:41.418 --> 32:42.793
You were ready this morning.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.420
She's not done!

32:45.881 --> 32:47.965
She's got to save that guy.

32:58.352 --> 33:00.144
Alternate theories?

33:00.270 --> 33:02.480
Amebiasis was our best hope.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.690
The fact that her heart rate
went back to normal

33:04.816 --> 33:06.400
when we stopped the meds confirms...

33:06.526 --> 33:07.818
What's our second-best hope?

33:07.944 --> 33:11.113
House, put down the wand,
there's no obstruction.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.741
Maybe we should just biopsy it.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.951
She's a fridge with the power out.

33:16.078 --> 33:19.872
If we start poking around inside,
the vegetable goes bad.

33:21.917 --> 33:22.958
No offense.

33:23.085 --> 33:24.543
I don't see that we have
a lot of choice.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.295
The only way
we'll find that infection...

33:26.421 --> 33:29.382
What if it's not an infection?
Toxins can cause similar symptoms,

33:29.508 --> 33:31.425
especially if whatever
it is did liver damage.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.427
Her toxin screen was clean.

33:33.553 --> 33:36.931
Those things never cover
for any of the really cool toxins.

33:37.057 --> 33:39.934
Run the screen again
for whatever you can think of.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.144
You, keep the other patient alive.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.813
You check out the school.

33:43.939 --> 33:47.900
And I seem to need to hire
another doctor to go search her home.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.278
Come on.

33:54.282 --> 33:57.660
If she was taking any medications,
I'd know about it.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.580
Does your wife dye her hair?

34:01.790 --> 34:06.168
No. Her mom never went gray,
she didn't either.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.337
Guess this must be yours, then.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.132
Can you think of anything else
she might've lied to you about?

34:11.258 --> 34:14.260
Any drugs she gave up
when she married you?

34:25.772 --> 34:27.773
How are you feeling, sir?

34:28.024 --> 34:31.152
Mr. Arrington?

34:33.321 --> 34:34.947
What's going on?

34:35.157 --> 34:37.116
His heart's not pumping enough blood
to his brain.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.619
We're gonna have to give it some help.
Get the balloon ready.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.793
Do you use this drawer?

34:48.295 --> 34:50.337
No, that's for her vitamins.

34:50.464 --> 34:51.922
And sleeping pills.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.842
She never took sleeping pills.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.218
Okay.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.097
You on a diet?

35:01.016 --> 35:02.141
No.

35:08.023 --> 35:11.066
I guess you never
really know someone, do you?

35:11.234 --> 35:12.943
Quite the insight.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.696
She lied to you about her hair color

35:15.822 --> 35:18.949
and didn't want you to know
she thought she was fat.

35:19.075 --> 35:22.286
Unless you never lied to her
about anything that huge,

35:22.412 --> 35:25.206
I think you can probably
let those slide.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.335
Diet pills could have messed her up.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.837
Raised the liver enzymes
and caused the bellyache.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.422
Not the fever.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.341
Maybe something else set off the fever.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.467
Like what?

35:36.593 --> 35:39.261
Before I show you these, they were
in a locked drawer in her desk.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.889
The vice principal said that Laura
must have confiscated them.

35:42.015 --> 35:45.684
- They've had some problems...
- Neither interesting nor helpful.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.813
This, at least, is interesting.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.565
No, it's not.

35:51.691 --> 35:54.568
Sex with teenagers isn't interesting?
Where did you grow up?

35:54.694 --> 35:58.030
It isn't helpful.
Teenage boys aren't toxins.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.033
What if the cyst isn't a cyst?

36:01.535 --> 36:03.994
Then we have nothing to go on.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.664
I said it's not a cyst.
I didn't say it was nothing.

36:06.790 --> 36:07.957
What if it's a scar?

36:08.083 --> 36:09.834
FitzHugh-Curtis syndrome?

36:10.210 --> 36:11.919
You're pushing gonorrhea again?

36:12.045 --> 36:13.796
You got anything better?

36:13.922 --> 36:16.841
Test her. And start her on ceftriaxone.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.897
What are you testing for now?

36:33.525 --> 36:35.568
Just some more infections.

36:49.833 --> 36:52.042
She's positive for gonorrhea.

36:54.796 --> 36:57.631
I think that's the first time
those words have been uttered in joy.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.716
The meds are started.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.343
Her heart should be clear enough
to use in about four or five hours.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.012
I'll go tell the families.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.430
He's in a coma.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.433
- Start him on dobutamine.
- Already did.

37:07.559 --> 37:11.645
We either do the surgery now
or we find him a new brain, too.

37:12.105 --> 37:15.816
House, she's still got a significant
amount of gonorrhea in her system.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.777
Hopefully tomorrow
it'll be in his system.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.198
I need two O.R.'s
and the transplant team.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.285
Get ready.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.705
- What is it?
- Excuse me.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.626
Insert IV.

37:34.461 --> 37:35.461
Sides up.

37:35.837 --> 37:38.213
What's going on? Is he getting a heart?

37:38.340 --> 37:39.715
Yeah.

37:45.305 --> 37:46.972
Come on, come on.

37:51.144 --> 37:54.897
I assume this means
you found out what was wrong with Laura.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.696
She had amebiasis.

38:03.323 --> 38:06.492
We just found a different way
to get rid of it.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.287
Thank you.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.626
That was kind of you.

38:15.752 --> 38:18.003
I didn't want him going postal on us.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.339
As soon as his wife's heart's in
our hands

38:20.465 --> 38:22.508
you can tell him about the gonorrhea.

38:23.259 --> 38:25.010
He's got to be tested.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.972
Preferably before
he gets any sympathy sex.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.715
Paddles.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.596
Fifty joules.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.893
Charging.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.526
Charging.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.744
Let's take him off bypass.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.082
Okay.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.209
Switch...

39:50.805 --> 39:54.183
Mr. Neuberger, there's something
I need to tell you.

39:56.061 --> 39:59.855
For the last year

40:00.565 --> 40:01.899
or so,

40:03.359 --> 40:05.527
Laura was kind of distant with me.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.279
I don't know why.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.908
I thought maybe
she was having an affair.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.077
But, not Laura.

40:13.328 --> 40:17.664
And I'm not excusing myself, but when
I was traveling during Christmas

40:17.791 --> 40:19.124
I had a...

40:20.001 --> 40:22.002
I had a one-night stand.

40:22.128 --> 40:23.754
I got gonorrhea.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.926
- Are you sure...
- Yeah.

40:30.386 --> 40:32.846
I should've said something to you.

40:33.223 --> 40:35.599
But I didn't wanna believe
that I gave it to her.

40:35.725 --> 40:40.270
That's what made her sick and that was
why she got into the accident.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.294
Cecile?

41:06.005 --> 41:07.172
Am I dead?

41:07.298 --> 41:09.049
Hopefully not for a long time.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.302
Why are you here?

41:12.428 --> 41:13.971
Amy called me.

41:15.557 --> 41:18.517
If you do Mom again,

41:18.643 --> 41:22.104
You're gonna have gonorrhea
in your system for a while.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.480
Could I stay with you for a few days?

42:06.482 --> 42:09.109
You idiot. You told her.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.819
She told me.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.948
Things have been crappy at home lately.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.784
I figured I wasn't spending
enough time with her.

42:17.911 --> 42:19.369

42:23.124 --> 42:25.042
Turns out you're right.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.169

42:28.796 --> 42:30.505
She's been having an affair.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.057
Want a beer?
