WEBVTT

00:00.434 --> 00:03.836
an inside look at the episode.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.374
(music playing)

00:08.476 --> 00:10.442
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "I Am Jazz--"

00:10.544 --> 00:12.077
GREG (VOICEOVER): Ahmir's
coming to town today.

00:12.179 --> 00:12.911
We're going to meet him.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.680
I really hope that I like him.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.816
GREG: You planning
to go back to school?

00:17.918 --> 00:19.551
AHMIR: Right now it's
all up in the air.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.253
AHMIR (VOICEOVER): I'm
definitely feeling reserved.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.555
I'm feeling very
reserved right now.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.757
Will you be my girlfriend?

00:24.859 --> 00:26.091
Yes, I will, Ahmir.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.293
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): It's so
cool to feel like someone

00:28.396 --> 00:30.129
really understands me.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.998
And I love where it's going.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.134
MARCI BOWERS (ON FACETIME):
So healing is coming along.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.135
Yeah.

00:36.237 --> 00:36.969
MARCI BOWERS (ON
FACETIME): It doesn't

00:37.071 --> 00:38.203
look like what I wanted to see.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.372
Does that require
another skin graft?

00:40.474 --> 00:41.440
MARCI BOWERS (ON FACETIME): Yes.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.241
One surgery.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.575
Probably two.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.245
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): This news
is just really devastating.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.013
MARCI BOWERS (ON FACETIME):
I think an exam incursive

00:48.115 --> 00:49.314
would be really beneficial.

00:49.417 --> 00:53.385
What if I was to come down
and FaceTime with Dr. Ting.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.254
GREG (VOICEOVER): My main
concern is that we're

00:55.356 --> 00:57.923
going to be back to square one.

00:58.025 --> 00:58.891
JEANETTE: I'm afraid to look.

00:58.993 --> 00:59.758
Oh, it's just Ari.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.260
Jazz is missing.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.162
GREG: Try to call Jazz.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.330
PHONE: Your call has been
forwarded to an automated

01:05.433 --> 01:06.498
voice messaging system.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.633
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
She's got a boyfriend.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.334
And we don't know
much about him.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.036
And what if there is
some kind of problem?

01:11.138 --> 01:13.305
I don't want my mind to
go places because if I do,

01:13.407 --> 01:14.606
then I'll have a
nervous breakdown.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.749
JEANETTE: Unbelievable.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.484
Does it make sense that
she wouldn't be picking up

01:25.586 --> 01:27.286
the phone or that
Ari wouldn't know

01:27.388 --> 01:30.422
where she is at this point?

01:30.524 --> 01:31.256
Doesn't make sense.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.591
But nothing makes sense, Greg.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.695
Let's go.

01:36.797 --> 01:37.663
Let's get out of here and
figure out what's going on.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.730
OK.

01:38.833 --> 01:39.832
I'm with you on this one.

01:39.934 --> 01:40.699
(sigh)

01:41.602 --> 01:43.068
Sorry about the romance.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.570
Is there still
chocolates in the room?

01:44.672 --> 01:45.871
Maybe we'll just have
that for dessert.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.977
(music playing)

01:58.853 --> 02:00.219
JAZZ: Hey, what's up?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.887
JEANETTE: Really?

02:01.989 --> 02:03.188
GREG: Disappeared
on us last night.

02:03.290 --> 02:03.989
JAZZ: I'm sorry.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.290
GREG: You really worried us.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.091
I just--

02:06.193 --> 02:07.426
Jazz, no, wait.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.329
Picture this-- Dad and I are
also having a romantic date,

02:10.431 --> 02:11.830
a wonderful romantic date.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.732
And then I get a text from Ari.

02:13.834 --> 02:14.733
And I call her.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.635
And she couldn't find you.

02:16.737 --> 02:17.836
I didn't mean
to scare you guys.

02:17.938 --> 02:18.971
I was just preoccupied.

02:19.073 --> 02:20.939
I wasn't looking at my phone.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.608
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I feel
bad for making my parents

02:22.710 --> 02:23.876
worry about me so much.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.645
But I'm almost 18-years old.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.647
And I would rather
talk to my parents

02:28.749 --> 02:31.517
about how Ahmir and I are
official in our relationship

02:31.619 --> 02:33.252
status rather than
them grilling me

02:33.354 --> 02:35.287
about not answering my phone.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.522
I didn't do anything on purpose.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.857
I really was just with
Ahmir, and was focused

02:38.959 --> 02:41.393
on him and what we
were doing, that I

02:41.495 --> 02:42.494
didn't see by phone right away.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.795
It happens.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.230
But I have told you to keep
the ringer on next to you.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.999
JAZZ: I usually keep it
around me all the time.

02:47.101 --> 02:48.300
Well, Ari didn't
know where you were.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.568
Well--

02:49.670 --> 02:50.869
So--

02:50.971 --> 02:52.337
JAZZ: Why do you guys always
have to worry about where

02:52.439 --> 02:53.472
I'm going all the time?

02:53.574 --> 02:54.806
JEANETTE: I worry about
where all the kids are.

02:54.909 --> 02:56.642
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER): When
she's upset about something,

02:56.744 --> 02:59.311
she will literally
get up and go.

02:59.413 --> 03:03.081
Jazz is fully aware that
when she goes off the radar,

03:03.184 --> 03:04.449
that we're all
going to freak out.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.218
GREG (VOICEOVER): And I think
she's at a point in her life

03:06.320 --> 03:08.854
where she really wants to
push back and maybe even

03:08.956 --> 03:10.489
shut us down altogether.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.358
When I'm 18, maybe you could
give me a little bit more

03:13.460 --> 03:14.493
independence.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.629
It shouldn't be necessary
to know everything

03:17.731 --> 03:18.730
I'm doing at all times.

03:18.832 --> 03:19.831
JEANETTE: I don't need
to know everything.

03:19.934 --> 03:20.766
I just need to know you're safe.
- I get it.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.567
I get it.

03:21.669 --> 03:22.367
I get it.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.168
I understand.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.903
And that's why I apologize.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.305
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I
am so grateful to have

03:26.407 --> 03:28.273
parents who love me as
much as they love me.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.142
And I love them
so much in return.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.877
But now that I
have a dating life,

03:31.979 --> 03:34.413
I definitely feel like my
parents should just give

03:34.515 --> 03:36.048
me my own space and freedom.

03:36.150 --> 03:39.451
I don't want them being on top
of me for every little thing

03:39.553 --> 03:40.719
that I do.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.021
Just be conscious
of it in the future.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.424
Just have it around
you with the ringer on.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.325
OK?

03:46.427 --> 03:47.125
Deal?

03:47.228 --> 03:47.926
All right.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.394
Yeah, I will try to do that.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.330
GREG (VOICEOVER):
Jazz appears to be

03:51.432 --> 03:53.031
looking for her independence.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.701
And we've always
given her enough space

03:55.803 --> 03:57.436
to make her own decisions.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.372
But it seems like
dating is piling

04:00.474 --> 04:03.542
on to this independence need.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.978
And also during
our romantic dinner,

04:06.080 --> 04:08.046
we get a call from Marci Bowers.

04:08.148 --> 04:08.847
OK.

04:08.949 --> 04:09.681
What happened?

04:09.817 --> 04:13.418
So Marci threw
us a curve ball.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.054
GREG: Basically, she's
coming down here.

04:16.156 --> 04:16.855
She just wanted to--

04:16.957 --> 04:18.090
Consult.

04:18.192 --> 04:21.760
Do you know why she
wants to examine me?

04:21.862 --> 04:23.028
Who knows?

04:23.130 --> 04:24.396
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I'm not
really sure why Dr. Bowers

04:24.498 --> 04:25.897
wants to see me in person.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.234
I already have a third
operation scheduled in New York

04:29.336 --> 04:33.305
to get a skin graft to repair a
lot of scar tissue in that area

04:33.407 --> 04:35.607
and make it more
cosmetically appealing.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.342
And now she wants to examine me.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.343
So I-- I just--

04:38.445 --> 04:40.078
I don't know what
she's looking for.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.113
She could come down.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.414
And she could change
her mind, saying,

04:42.516 --> 04:45.651
oh, we need a more heavy-duty
surgery, or she could say,

04:45.753 --> 04:47.419
OK, we're getting the
surgery that we planned,

04:47.521 --> 04:49.254
or she could say, oh,
look, you look good,

04:49.356 --> 04:50.889
we don't need surgery at all.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.190
They could go any way.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.597
(music playing)

05:02.703 --> 05:04.403
The more you
walk, the sooner you

05:04.505 --> 05:06.738
will be able to do other
things with me besides walking.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.208
Yes, I can't wait until
I could actually work

05:10.311 --> 05:12.811
out and do full-blown movement.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.546
But I'm meeting up with Marci.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.148
She's coming down to Florida.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.582
And she's going to examine me.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.452
And we're getting ready
for this next surgery.

05:20.554 --> 05:24.856
So I don't know how that's going
to hinder my recovery process

05:24.958 --> 05:26.725
and if I'm going to
be bedridden again.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.126
Like, imagine that.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.561
Let's hope for the best.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.564
I'm sorry for giving you,
Mom, and Dad a scare last night.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.699
It's OK.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.467
I was just preoccupied
hanging out with Ahmir,

05:35.569 --> 05:37.102
enjoying my date with him.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.670
Was it romantic?

05:38.772 --> 05:40.072
Yes.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.606
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): Ahmir makes
me feel really, really great.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.576
And I feel like he
really understands me.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.144
And I understand him.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.946
And we have a great connection.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.016
Day by day, I see him
opening up more and more.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.319
And I'm so glad, because he's
going back home in a few days.

05:54.421 --> 05:57.255
And I feel like I'm
finally cracking him open.

05:57.358 --> 06:00.292
We-- we had a
sunset kiss moment.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.961
So you're better
at kissing now or?

06:03.063 --> 06:03.795
(laughter)

06:03.897 --> 06:05.630
Yes.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.166
He also officially asked
me to be his girlfriend.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.501
ARI (VOICEOVER): I'm
really happy to see

06:09.603 --> 06:10.936
Jazz is finding romance.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.704
Being transgender,
it's definitely

06:12.806 --> 06:15.474
been a hard road for
Jazz to find people that

06:15.576 --> 06:16.808
are interested in dating her.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.778
And it's really awesome to
see that Ahmir is accepting

06:19.880 --> 06:21.747
and that he likes Jazz for Jazz.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.483
That's exciting that you have
a person and you kind of,

06:24.585 --> 06:26.918
like, are committed
to that person.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.520
I'm also turning 18 too.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.155
And I'm going to be an adult.
- Yeah, that's crazy.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.356
What happened
when you turned 18?

06:31.458 --> 06:33.525
Did anything change for
you in your life or no?

06:33.627 --> 06:36.628
I think I went and bought a
lottery ticket or something.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.963
(laughter)

06:38.065 --> 06:39.464
That's sweet.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.032
ARI: How do you think
it's going to change you?

06:41.135 --> 06:42.768
Because you sound like it's--

06:42.870 --> 06:44.503
it sounds like it's
a big deal for you.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.837
I feel like just
for many years,

06:45.939 --> 06:48.340
it's been obvious that I'm
a very independent person.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.876
And once I'm 18, I
could be independent,

06:50.978 --> 06:52.911
but legally live alone
at the same time,

06:53.013 --> 06:54.446
and be living my life.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.648
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): More and more,
I've been thinking about moving

06:56.750 --> 06:57.949
out of my parents' house.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.985
While my parents have
always supported me

07:00.087 --> 07:03.221
and they have been so great
throughout my entire life,

07:03.323 --> 07:06.858
I feel like I have accumulated
a good amount of money

07:06.960 --> 07:09.161
from my YouTube videos
and my advocacy work.

07:09.263 --> 07:14.699
And I just want to create my own
space and get my own freedom.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.234
I want to look for
apartments, and try

07:16.336 --> 07:19.371
to get a glimpse of what
the pricing looks like,

07:19.473 --> 07:21.239
and how to live independently
on my own, and--

07:21.341 --> 07:22.808
(snickering)
What?

07:22.910 --> 07:23.809
It's true.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.110
ARI (VOICEOVER):
Jazz has talked a lot

07:25.212 --> 07:27.379
about moving out over the
past maybe, like, two years.

07:27.481 --> 07:30.348
But I definitely think
Jazz has some growing

07:30.451 --> 07:32.851
up to do before she moves out.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.019
Well, you're still a kid.

07:34.121 --> 07:34.820
I know.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.188
I know.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.056
But, like, I was thinking that
if we find a nice place that's,

07:38.158 --> 07:41.426
like, close to home and
doesn't cost too much money,

07:41.528 --> 07:43.295
then we could pitch in
together and live together.

07:43.397 --> 07:44.296
OK.

07:44.398 --> 07:45.864
That's getting a
little too far there.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.732
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I know if
I'm talking about moving out

07:47.835 --> 07:50.502
on my own, and doing
this and that, my parents

07:50.604 --> 07:51.937
might not be supportive.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.805
But they would
definitely be more

07:53.907 --> 07:55.574
inclined to allow me
to move out if they

07:55.676 --> 07:57.008
knew I'd be living with Ari.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.011
So she's really a part
of my master plan.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.447
But then do you like living
with mom and dad though?

08:02.549 --> 08:05.083
I mean, it's, like,
not the worst situation.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.284
Like, they're feeding me.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.120
And I don't have to
pay for rent and stuff.

08:09.223 --> 08:10.355
So I can save up for that.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.723
That works.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.693
Well, I mean, if you want to
help me to look for apartments,

08:14.795 --> 08:16.828
I already know some
good places down here.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.930
That's cool to see different
places and what they look like.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.932
And you'll get an
idea of actually

08:21.034 --> 08:23.702
how expensive it is to not
live at home with your parents.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.937
ARI (VOICEOVER): Jazz is
pretty dead set on moving out.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.340
And when Jazz has her
mind set on something,

08:28.442 --> 08:30.575
she really does not let it go.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.980
A lot of things that
go into it, like cable,

08:35.082 --> 08:37.849
rent, internet, utilities.

08:37.951 --> 08:42.254
And you got to keep up with
them or you get late fees.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.623
(music playing)

08:49.530 --> 08:50.495
AHMIR: How are you feeling?

08:50.597 --> 08:52.097
(JOKINGLY) Better
now that you're here.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.565
(moaning)

08:53.667 --> 08:54.466
Listen, listen.

08:54.568 --> 08:57.402
So basically, I told my dad.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.303
And I told my mom.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.572
They know that I'm with you.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.240
They know that we're
in a relationship.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.343
They know that
I'm transgender?

09:05.445 --> 09:08.980
And they support that?

09:09.082 --> 09:12.751
My mom is not actually as
accepting as I originally

09:12.853 --> 09:13.585
thought she would be.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.525
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
I am just shocked.

09:20.627 --> 09:23.595
I finally found someone who
is fully accepting of me.

09:23.697 --> 09:27.032
Yet, his mom who raised
him does not accept me.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.833
I never ever expected this.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.882
AHMIR: My mom is not actually
as accepting as I originally

09:43.984 --> 09:44.683
thought she would be.

09:50.157 --> 09:55.360
JAZZ: So what has she said?

09:55.462 --> 09:57.295
A lot of-- like,
she didn't acknowledge

09:57.397 --> 09:58.630
you for who you were.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.266
So it was still like
she would say "he,"

10:01.368 --> 10:05.904
and, that's a man
because born a man, and--

10:06.006 --> 10:07.272
So she misgendered me?

10:07.374 --> 10:08.506
Yeah.

10:08.575 --> 10:11.676
So she just sees me as a guy?

10:11.778 --> 10:12.744
She does.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.112
AHMIR (VOICEOVER):
The most perfect thing

10:14.214 --> 10:16.147
my mom said was that
Jazz was still a man

10:16.249 --> 10:18.516
and that I would be gay
for being in a relationship

10:18.619 --> 10:19.884
with Jazz.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.687
As soon as my mom said that,
I just kind of, like, lost it.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.722
Because I'm not gay.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.023
I'm not attracted to men.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.425
And Jazz is a female.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.828
So it just didn't
make sense to me.

10:29.930 --> 10:35.734
So what does that mean for
us, and for you, and for me?

10:35.836 --> 10:38.436
Like, does that mean--

10:38.538 --> 10:39.537
It means nothing.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.740
I mean, how I feel is
not going to change.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.175
JAZZ: So I mean, with your
mom, like, how is that

10:44.277 --> 10:46.044
going to be when you
go back home to Philly

10:46.146 --> 10:47.479
and you're, like,
going in the housing,

10:47.581 --> 10:49.481
and you're like, oh, hi, Mom?

10:49.583 --> 10:50.749
I mean, she might--

10:50.851 --> 10:52.984
she might not let me back
in the house to be honest.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.085
Wait.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.287
So she's going to kick
you out of the house

10:56.423 --> 11:00.458
just because you like a girl
who happens to be transgender?

11:00.560 --> 11:01.259
Right.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.494
Because-- I don't know.

11:02.596 --> 11:03.461
That's just how she is.

11:03.563 --> 11:07.065
And I'm very outspoken.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.934
So yeah, that could
potentially lead to me,

11:10.037 --> 11:14.072
I guess, being kicked out of
the house or whatever else.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.841
I hope that doesn't happen.

11:16.943 --> 11:17.942
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
Our relationship

11:18.078 --> 11:20.245
was going so, so well.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.980
And now this happens.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.182
But despite this
whole situation,

11:24.284 --> 11:26.117
I'm really touched that
Ahmir is willing to stand up

11:26.219 --> 11:27.352
to his mother.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.188
But it's really scary to
think that, you know, just

11:30.323 --> 11:33.158
being in a relationship
with me could cause

11:33.260 --> 11:36.294
him to not even have a home.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.363
Is there any way we
could change her views?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.732
Like, I don't know.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.533
If she just--

11:41.635 --> 11:42.934
I feel like--

11:43.036 --> 11:44.602
JAZZ: I feel like if I just talk
to her or just something, like,

11:44.705 --> 11:45.570
and--

11:45.672 --> 11:46.805
I don't think so.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.808
I don't-- I feel like
she'll still have her views.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.576
And she'll still
have her opinions.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.511
I feel like we should
just enjoy our time

11:53.613 --> 11:56.581
together instead of worrying
about my family or whatever.

11:56.683 --> 11:57.716
I feel like at the
end of the day,

11:57.818 --> 11:59.784
we just got to
focus on each other.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.257
(music playing)

12:10.831 --> 12:12.397
(laughter)

12:12.499 --> 12:13.598
(grunt)

12:13.700 --> 12:14.733
- Jay, you got to go straight.
- I'm not jumping!

12:14.835 --> 12:15.800
(laughter)

12:15.902 --> 12:18.403
You guys are going
to give me anxiety.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.771
How are you a cheerleader?

12:19.873 --> 12:20.705
I'm done.
JAZZ: OK.

12:20.807 --> 12:21.506
Kaci.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.209
Kaci, the non-cheerleader.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.543
Awesome.

12:25.645 --> 12:28.213
JAZZ: Once my vagina is
healed and I am back in shape,

12:28.315 --> 12:29.881
then I'm going to
do back flips again.

12:29.983 --> 12:30.682
Yeah.

12:30.784 --> 12:31.950
I think I broke my back.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.084
- Should I try one?
- No.

12:33.186 --> 12:33.885
(laughter)

12:33.987 --> 12:34.753
- Um, no.
- I know.

12:34.855 --> 12:35.553
I'm kidding.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.755
I'm kidding.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.923
Did I tell you guys my--
how my date went with Ahmir?

12:39.025 --> 12:39.924
Spill the beans.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.259
Yeah, spill your beans.

12:41.361 --> 12:45.363
He took me to this, like,
little desert chocolate place.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.665
The sunset view was so, so nice.

12:47.768 --> 12:48.833
And it was romantic.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.368
And we kissed.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.837
So how's my kissing game now?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.539
It's the best I've ever had.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.473
Really?

12:55.575 --> 12:58.243
(SOFTLY) Yes.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.410
How was kissing?

12:59.513 --> 13:01.279
Yeah, your girl got good.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.249
And now he's like, you're the
best kisser I've ever kissed.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.216
Oh, gosh.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.251
That's great.
KACI: You told us--

13:06.353 --> 13:07.252
That happened real quick.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.319
KACI: One person says it.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.320
You're like, I'm the best.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.321
JAZZ: I'm the best.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.823
But yeah, I want you
guys to like him.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.391
Because I think
if you saw, like,

13:13.493 --> 13:15.426
how he was acting
with me on that date,

13:15.529 --> 13:16.928
then you would like him more.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.563
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
Kaci and Jay aren't

13:18.665 --> 13:22.033
necessarily on board when
it comes to me dating Ahmir.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.169
Their first impressions
were not too good.

13:24.271 --> 13:28.473
But I really want them to be
able to see what I see in him.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.440
It was really fun.

13:29.543 --> 13:30.708
And I'm having a
good time with him.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.077
I'm sad that he was going
to be leaving Florida soon.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.046
But I'm enjoying it all.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.015
Just spend as much
time with him as you can.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.050
And get to know him as
much as you can too.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.418
JAZZ: Yeah.

13:40.520 --> 13:45.123
There's one thing that did come
up that's kind of like, grr.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.726
His mom is not accepting of me.

13:48.829 --> 13:49.494
Like, at all?

13:49.629 --> 13:50.662
Mm-mm.

13:50.764 --> 13:53.665
She, like, misgenders me
through texting, saying,

13:53.800 --> 13:56.067
like, why are you
dating that man?

13:56.169 --> 13:57.268
What?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.103
And she's like hasn't
even seen a picture of me.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.138
She hasn't met me before.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.573
She doesn't know me.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.776
But she's just like, my son's
gay, like, this, that, that.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.411
And she really just
is so ignorant--

14:06.513 --> 14:07.178
What the heck?

14:07.280 --> 14:07.979
--and doesn't get it.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.314
KACI: Oh, my gosh.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.150
Do you think that you
and Ahmir would ever end

14:12.252 --> 14:14.919
up breaking up because of this?

14:15.021 --> 14:17.922
Based on what he tells me,
it really seems like he's going

14:18.024 --> 14:19.224
to do what he wants to do.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.426
And he's not going to end
a relationship with someone

14:21.528 --> 14:24.963
that he cares for just because
his mom was like, tranny,

14:25.065 --> 14:26.598
du du du, man, blah blah blah.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.432
Like, you know?

14:27.534 --> 14:28.600
I guess it's different for me.

14:28.702 --> 14:29.767
Because I'm closer
with my parents.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.069
And if, like, they
didn't like somebody,

14:31.171 --> 14:33.071
it would really affect
the way I saw them.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.505
KACI (VOICEOVER):
Hearing about Ahmir's mom

14:34.608 --> 14:37.175
does take a toll on my
whole opinion towards him.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.911
It's a huge red flag,
because our family influences

14:40.013 --> 14:42.046
us a lot in our choices
and our decisions

14:42.148 --> 14:43.848
of who we're with especially.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.183
It may affect you
guys in the long run

14:45.285 --> 14:46.618
if you're going to
commit yourself to this.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.386
And then, eventually,
it just doesn't

14:48.488 --> 14:50.388
work out just because he can't
get over this certain hump.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.422
JAZZ: That's what I worry about.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.657
I don't want to be
the one that makes

14:52.759 --> 14:54.659
him stop talking to his family.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.394
Do your parents
know that Ahmir's

14:56.496 --> 14:58.429
mom doesn't fully accept you?

14:58.531 --> 15:00.398
No, I have not told them yet.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.266
I'll get to it.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.200
And I'll tell them.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.201
I need to.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.402
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
The biggest thing

15:04.504 --> 15:05.503
I fear in telling my
parents about this situation

15:05.605 --> 15:08.539
with Ahmir's mom is
that they'll tell me I

15:08.642 --> 15:09.941
should just break up with him.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.611
And it would be a huge
conflict, because I

15:13.713 --> 15:14.679
don't want to do that.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.314
KACI: Make it your top priority.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.115
JAY: Yeah.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.583
Yep.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.085
(music playing)

15:25.158 --> 15:26.057
GREG: What are you doing?

15:26.159 --> 15:27.825
JEANETTE: I'm
organizing my purse.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.395
It's gotta be done, you know?

15:30.497 --> 15:31.195
JAZZ: Hey.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.163
GREG: Hello.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.197
JEANETTE: Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.332
Is that you're painting shirt?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.133
You know me.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.334
I'm a scrub.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.302
So Jazz, what do you want?

15:37.404 --> 15:38.169
(chuckles)

15:38.271 --> 15:40.471
Usually, you want something.

15:40.573 --> 15:44.042
So I need to talk to you
guys about my boyfriend.

15:44.144 --> 15:44.976
(soft music playing)

15:45.078 --> 15:46.878
We're all ears.

15:46.980 --> 15:51.082
So Ahmir's parents aren't
really accepting of the fact

15:51.184 --> 15:53.318
that I'm transgender--

15:53.420 --> 15:55.386
or at least his mom isn't.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.690
She referred to me as
a man, saying, why--

15:58.792 --> 16:00.725
why are you dating a man,
I'll never accept that.

16:00.794 --> 16:01.626
What?

16:01.728 --> 16:04.195
And saying, like,
"he," and "boy,"

16:04.297 --> 16:07.298
and just using the
wrong pronouns.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.034
You know, he was telling me that
he doesn't know if his mom is

16:10.136 --> 16:12.403
going to allow him
to stay at the house

16:12.505 --> 16:13.705
when he gets back
home to Philly.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.206
She's going to kick
him out because of you?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.541
She might.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.743
He's going to get home and
not have somewhere to live?

16:18.845 --> 16:20.478
That's pretty messed up.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.913
What do you think I should do?

16:22.015 --> 16:23.348
Is there anything I should do?

16:23.450 --> 16:25.883
I said that I'm open
to meeting his mom.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.919
The fact that she's calling
me a "man," and this,

16:28.021 --> 16:29.420
and that, maybe
she's envisioning me

16:29.522 --> 16:31.923
to be something that I'm not.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.391
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I
invited Ahmir to join me

16:33.526 --> 16:35.760
in New York for my
surgery, because Philly

16:35.862 --> 16:38.796
is only two and a half hours
away through a bus ride.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.766
And maybe I'll get an
opportunity to meet Ahmir's

16:41.868 --> 16:43.634
mom while I'm out there.

16:43.737 --> 16:46.838
Well, it's up to him to
sort it out with his mom,

16:46.940 --> 16:48.473
really between them.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.308
Don't get involved.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.176
And maybe she'll come around.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.978
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
Personally, I'm really

16:54.047 --> 16:55.713
not fond of transphobic people.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.749
So I really don't
want any of my kids

16:57.851 --> 16:59.817
dating anyone that's
transphobic or has

16:59.919 --> 17:01.352
a family that's transphobic.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.489
But at the same time, I
want to be fair to Jazz.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.758
This is her first relationship.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.226
I don't want to get in the way.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.194
This is a very serious issue.

17:10.296 --> 17:13.331
And he's just going to have to
convince his family that you're

17:13.433 --> 17:15.099
you and he cares about you.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.735
And that-- that's
between them though.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.505
GREG: I'm more concerned
about how it impacts

17:20.607 --> 17:22.640
your relationship with Ahmir.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.008
I mean, he lives there.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.343
He lives with his mom.
JAZZ: I know.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.677
Exactly.
That's why I'm worried.

17:26.780 --> 17:27.678
GREG: That's really important.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.480
You guys just-- you
really just met.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.749
And you guys will have to
think about how it affects

17:31.851 --> 17:33.918
your long-term relationship.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.453
JEANETTE: Right now it's
about the two of you.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.888
And--
- Exactly.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.356
JEANETTE: Just
concentrate on that.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.657
That's what I say.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.859
GREG (VOICEOVER):
I hope that Ahmir

17:41.961 --> 17:43.828
can explain things to
his mom and make her

17:43.930 --> 17:45.196
understand the issue better.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.998
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER): Yeah,
it stinks that it's happening.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.533
But if they care
about each other,

17:48.635 --> 17:50.735
I believe that they
could overcome it.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.070
It's hurtful to me.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.639
You know, it's-- it's sad.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.842
GREG: She's coming to
realize that when you're

17:57.944 --> 18:01.512
in a relationship, it takes
two to tango and then some,

18:01.614 --> 18:04.749
because there's family of the
person you're tangoing with.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.084
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
I could definitely

18:06.186 --> 18:08.619
see where somebody
who is very intolerant

18:08.721 --> 18:12.323
could try to harm or
sabotage a relationship.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.625
I know it has happened
in many relationships

18:14.727 --> 18:16.694
where a family is able
to break up a couple.

18:16.796 --> 18:20.231
There might be a point where
decisions have to be made.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.201
And Ahmir might have
to make a-- a choice.

18:23.303 --> 18:27.805
I don't know that this
relationship is, you know--

18:27.907 --> 18:28.806
I don't know where it's going.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.577
(music playing)

18:32.679 --> 18:35.213
I thought what I would do
is send a picture to Dr. Ting.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.881
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I'm
scared that they'll say we

18:36.983 --> 18:38.616
need a more extensive surgery.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.351
What are your impressions?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.019
DOCTOR TING (ON FACETIME):
Well, I'm shocked.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.868
(music playing)

19:01.407 --> 19:03.307
KIM: Can you clean
the finger holes?

19:03.409 --> 19:04.709
I get nervous putting
my fingers in there.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.810
Oh, they're dirty.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.312
Da da da da.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.114
Look at that form.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.150
I'm feeling so much
more confident now.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.518
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.619
You have nothing to worry about.

19:14.721 --> 19:15.987
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
I'm getting together

19:16.089 --> 19:17.054
with my sister-in-law Kim.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.823
She is a great person
to have a good time

19:18.925 --> 19:22.393
with and just decompress,
because she makes me laugh.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.762
I can't do your fancy feet.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.030
Are you going to go sideways?

19:26.132 --> 19:27.064
No.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.366
We keep trying to make plans.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.369
And then sickness and vaginas--

19:31.471 --> 19:34.438
everything is really
getting in the way.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.573
JEANETTE: There you go.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.774
Well, at least you are
going to hit something.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.309
(pins knocking over)
You just got a strike.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.110
Oh, my god.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.578
(laughing)

19:42.048 --> 19:43.548
I swear to God that was a fluke.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.016
You lied to me.
You're a good bowler.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.250
- I swear to you.
- Are you hustling me?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.251
No.
(chuckles)

19:47.353 --> 19:49.353
Never.

19:49.455 --> 19:50.688
JEANETTE: I'm glad
that we're doing this.

19:50.823 --> 19:51.989
KIM: We have been trying
to do this all summer.

19:52.091 --> 19:52.990
JEANETTE: Yeah.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.225
But look what
happened to my summer.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.293
So what's going on now?

19:55.395 --> 19:56.327
When are you--

19:56.429 --> 19:57.295
Ugh.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.696
We have to meet
with Jazz's doctor.

19:58.798 --> 19:59.764
Coming--

19:59.866 --> 20:01.165
She's coming-- she's
coming to Florida.

20:01.267 --> 20:01.966
Oh, she's coming here?

20:02.068 --> 20:02.900
Yeah.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.068
She'll examine
Jazz and determine

20:04.170 --> 20:05.870
her surgery next week.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.305
- Not down here?
- Not here, in New York.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.105
Back in New York?

20:08.208 --> 20:09.140
Yeah.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.876
I am truly freaking
out about the fact

20:11.978 --> 20:16.347
that we have this upcoming
appointment with Dr. Bowers.

20:16.449 --> 20:20.117
I'm very guarded and very
pessimistic in a sense-- like,

20:20.220 --> 20:22.286
what now, what's
going to happen?

20:22.388 --> 20:23.654
How long are you
going to be there then?

20:23.756 --> 20:26.023
Originally, she
said a week or two--

20:26.125 --> 20:28.259
a week or two.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.428
I'm like, this is,
like, a nightmare.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.264
The possibility that jazz
could have more trouble,

20:33.366 --> 20:36.167
more complications is something
that I can't even fathom,

20:36.269 --> 20:38.869
because if I do, I might
have a nervous breakdown.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.538
I feel like this is,
like, a workout kind of.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.372
JEANETTE: I think so.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.206
Upper body.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.975
JEANETTE: My heart rate's up.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.744
Well-- oh, now you're
looking like me.

20:46.846 --> 20:47.878
I went in hot.
JEANETTE: It hurts.

20:47.981 --> 20:48.679
It hurts.

20:48.781 --> 20:49.947
(laughing)

20:50.049 --> 20:52.316
So, um, her boyfriend
might come visit.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.751
KIM: In New York?

20:53.853 --> 20:55.186
Oh, he's cute.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.387
Yeah, he's adorable.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.389
But the thing about him
is-- and he said it to me,

20:58.491 --> 20:59.657
and he says it to
anybody-- he goes,

20:59.759 --> 21:01.626
I don't care that
Jazz is transgender.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.660
That's so good.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.295
I just look at her
and I see a girl.

21:04.397 --> 21:08.566
It turns out though that his
mother, who lives in Philly--

21:08.668 --> 21:10.501
she doesn't quite
see it that way.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.038
So he's afraid that
his mom may not

21:14.140 --> 21:15.706
let him stay there
anymore maybe-- like,

21:15.808 --> 21:16.707
you know what, you're
not welcome here.

21:16.809 --> 21:17.608
Because his girlfriend
is transgender?

21:17.710 --> 21:18.843
Yeah.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.478
He was-- he's actually
legitimately afraid of that.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.245
That's so sad.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.046
That is sad, isn't it?

21:22.148 --> 21:23.281
That's sad.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.116
Let me ask you, what
would you do if you were me?

21:25.218 --> 21:26.517
So you have not
spoken to her--

21:26.619 --> 21:27.318
No.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.486
--the parents?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.854
If I were you, I would--

21:29.956 --> 21:32.390
I'd feel that need
to explain it to her.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.724
Just meet so then
you'll understand--

21:33.826 --> 21:34.925
Talk to her?

21:35.028 --> 21:36.093
Yeah.

21:36.195 --> 21:36.894
I mean--

21:36.996 --> 21:38.095
I don't know.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.497
KIM (VOICEOVER): I think
Jeanette should definitely

21:39.599 --> 21:40.631
speak with Ahmir's mom.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.566
Because I think if she
was to talk to Jeanette,

21:42.669 --> 21:45.002
it would open her mind
up a little more--

21:45.104 --> 21:46.137
hopefully.

21:46.239 --> 21:48.839
Well, Greg is usually
of the mindset, like,

21:48.941 --> 21:51.409
just stay away from
it, don't mess with it.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.878
But, like, Jazz-- like,
she wants to talk to her.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.913
Well, if it was
one of my three,

21:56.015 --> 21:57.915
I would not want them
to meet her alone.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.550
I'd feel better
if I was with her.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.351
Yeah, me too.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.519
That's really what I would--

22:01.621 --> 22:02.887
I think is the best thing.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.923
Like, I wouldn't just set Jazz
off with Ahmir to meet mom.

22:06.025 --> 22:06.991
Jazz may insist though.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.392
She might be like,
Mom, I don't know how--

22:08.494 --> 22:09.460
She might.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.594
She might say, Mom,
let me handle this.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.196
Yeah, just-- yeah, but
just say, I'd be more--

22:12.298 --> 22:13.297
I want to meet her anyway.

22:13.399 --> 22:16.133
Our kids are dating,
I'd like to meet her.

22:16.235 --> 22:18.903
The more I think about
it, the more I'm like--

22:19.005 --> 22:20.004
because what is she going to do?

22:20.106 --> 22:20.805
Punch me in the face?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.740
(chuckling)

22:22.842 --> 22:24.642
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
After speaking to Kim,

22:24.744 --> 22:27.545
I realized I would really
like to talk to Ahmir's mom.

22:27.647 --> 22:28.846
I never like confrontation.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.147
I'm one that really hates it.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.350
But you know what, I want
to tell her what the deal

22:32.452 --> 22:33.484
is-- like, you're wrong.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.923
(music playing)

22:43.029 --> 22:43.728
What's up?

22:43.830 --> 22:44.862
GREG: Hello.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.030
JEANETTE: What's-- oh,
don't you look pretty.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.932
- You too.
- And you look handsome.

22:48.034 --> 22:48.733
Oh, yes.

22:48.835 --> 22:49.734
Thank you.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.769
Except for the
little Leo scratches.

22:51.871 --> 22:52.603
Yeah, I like it.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.805
I might get a tattoo like this.

22:54.907 --> 22:55.706
(chuckling)

22:55.808 --> 22:56.707
GREG: It's nice.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.909
So did you enjoy
your stay in Florida?

22:59.011 --> 23:00.044
Yeah, I wish I stayed longer.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.479
But yeah.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.080
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): It's time
to take Ahmir to the airport.

23:03.182 --> 23:06.484
And it's sad saying goodbye,
because we had a great time

23:06.586 --> 23:09.086
and I want to continue
hanging out with him.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.821
Good to meet you.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.189
Have a safe trip back.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.023
I'll see you guys soon.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.859
JEANETTE: Yeah.

23:14.961 --> 23:18.028
Thank you for coming and for
being so sweet to my Jazz.

23:18.131 --> 23:20.064
GREG (VOICEOVER): It was nice
to have Ahmir visit in Florida.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.233
And I see nice
qualities in Ahmir

23:22.368 --> 23:23.467
the more I get to know him.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.268
All right.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.169
Bye.

23:25.271 --> 23:26.337
Drive safe.

23:26.472 --> 23:27.772
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
I know right now he's

23:27.874 --> 23:28.839
a really good thing for her.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.441
She's just come off the surgery.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.309
And her life is evolving.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.845
And I think that this is
very important to her.

23:34.947 --> 23:38.582
And he's playing a big
role in her life right now.

23:38.718 --> 23:41.285
I feel bad for Ahmir having
to go back to a situation

23:41.387 --> 23:43.954
now at home where his
mother is not accepting

23:44.056 --> 23:45.389
of his relationship with Jazz.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.192
And this is going
to be hard on him.

23:48.294 --> 23:49.693
JAZZ: I have a lot
of fun with you.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.928
I'm sad that you're going.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.663
I'll see you again
soon hopefully.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.464
You will.

23:53.566 --> 23:54.265
You will.

23:54.367 --> 23:55.666
Especially when I, um--

23:55.768 --> 23:58.202
when I come to New
York for the surgery--

23:58.304 --> 23:59.503
I'm not going to miss that.

23:59.605 --> 24:00.771
That's sooner than later.

24:00.873 --> 24:01.705
So--

24:01.808 --> 24:02.807
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
My biggest fear

24:02.909 --> 24:04.575
for when Ahmir gets
home is that he's not

24:04.677 --> 24:06.143
going to have a place to stay.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.446
And I just worry
because I don't want

24:08.548 --> 24:11.582
to be the cause of him
not having, you know,

24:11.684 --> 24:14.351
just a place to sleep.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.786
Ooh, a strong one.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.121
AHMIR (VOICEOVER):
Even though my mom

24:17.256 --> 24:19.824
isn't accepting about it, I
think me and Jazz grew closer.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.726
And our relationship gets
better and stronger every day.

24:22.829 --> 24:23.594
(kiss)

24:24.363 --> 24:25.062
All right.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.430
Take care.

24:26.532 --> 24:27.765
AHMIR (VOICEOVER): I want to
see my relationship with Jazz

24:27.900 --> 24:29.700
just build from here--
just go further and as far

24:29.802 --> 24:30.801
as we can go.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.103
Because I don't care
my family likes Jazz.

24:33.206 --> 24:33.904
I like Jazz.

24:39.946 --> 24:42.313
(music playing)

24:44.984 --> 24:46.283
JEANETTE: Oh, I can't
wait for the day

24:46.385 --> 24:50.721
that we're done with doctors'
offices and hospitals.

24:50.823 --> 24:51.755
I'll like it when it's just--

24:51.858 --> 24:52.556
Not yet.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.924
--annual checkups.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.993
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): Next week,
I will need to go to New York

24:56.095 --> 24:57.261
to get a skin graft procedure.

24:57.363 --> 24:58.362
MARCI BOWERS: Hello.
- Hi.

24:58.464 --> 24:58.996
I would say it's
improved on the scale.

24:59.098 --> 24:59.797
It's, like, a seven.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.098
You look so good.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.700
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I'm
definitely a little worried

25:02.802 --> 25:07.004
that Dr. Bowers is going to
examine me and say that we need

25:07.106 --> 25:09.740
a more extensive surgery, that
the complications are more

25:09.842 --> 25:11.642
severe than she anticipated.

25:11.744 --> 25:12.976
And I'm really hoping
that it doesn't

25:13.045 --> 25:14.512
include any extra steps.

25:14.614 --> 25:15.779
MARCI BOWERS: Now,
let's come on back.

25:15.882 --> 25:16.580
And we--
- Let's go on back.

25:16.682 --> 25:17.781
MARCI BOWERS: We'll talk.

25:17.884 --> 25:18.849
MARCI BOWERS (VOICEOVER):
The goal of today's exam

25:18.951 --> 25:21.385
is to see how the
wound has progressed,

25:21.487 --> 25:24.054
see if it's appropriate still
to go forward with a skin graft,

25:24.156 --> 25:26.323
and how much of an area
we would need to cover.

25:26.425 --> 25:27.491
So it's been nine weeks.

25:27.593 --> 25:28.292
Welcome back.

25:28.394 --> 25:29.093
Yes.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.060
How's it going?

25:30.162 --> 25:30.995
Pretty good.

25:31.097 --> 25:31.829
Yeah.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.097
Healing slowly, but steadily.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.498
MARCI BOWERS: Yeah.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.800
JAZZ: It's definitely changing
form every day it feels like.

25:36.903 --> 25:40.704
If you go look at one
photo from each week,

25:40.806 --> 25:41.672
it'll be a different photo.

25:41.774 --> 25:42.773
MARCI BOWERS: Great.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.543
So that presents us
with a good opportunity

25:45.645 --> 25:47.878
to put a skin graft on the area.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.281
It's particularly
receptive at this point.

25:50.383 --> 25:53.617
And that would allow just
any scar to be covered.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.786
How do we know that the
graft will take for sure?

25:55.888 --> 25:57.154
Because I know--

25:57.256 --> 26:01.358
I know last time we did the
skin grafts, but only 50% took.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.293
Exactly.

26:02.395 --> 26:03.827
And that is going
to be a question

26:03.930 --> 26:05.095
we're going to ask Dr. Ting.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.765
I thought what I
would do is examine

26:07.867 --> 26:11.235
you, and then send the
picture to Dr. Ting,

26:11.337 --> 26:13.571
and then get him on FaceTime.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.839
And then we can talk about
it right here live with him.

26:15.942 --> 26:16.674
JAZZ: OK.

26:16.776 --> 26:17.474
OK.

26:17.577 --> 26:18.809
I just-- I'll excuse myself.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.678
And then just call me when
we're ready to do the FaceTime.

26:20.780 --> 26:21.478
OK.

26:21.581 --> 26:22.780
Perfect.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.181
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): Dr. Bowers
has not examined my vagina

26:24.283 --> 26:26.417
in person since New York.

26:26.519 --> 26:28.586
We have been sending
progress photos,

26:28.688 --> 26:30.955
but the last one did
not look too great.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.557
And I'm scared that it's
still not looking the way

26:33.659 --> 26:34.792
that she wants it to look.

26:34.894 --> 26:35.693
MARCI BOWERS: I'm going
to get my gloves on.

26:35.795 --> 26:36.994
Hold on.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.295
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER): Jazz
has been through the ringer

26:38.397 --> 26:40.798
emotionally and physically.

26:40.900 --> 26:41.966
I mean, she is my baby.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.400
And watching her
go through this has

26:43.502 --> 26:45.002
been a very painful journey.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.538
We can't handle any more
bad news at this point.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.752
(music playing)

27:01.887 --> 27:02.586
MARCI BOWERS: All right.

27:02.688 --> 27:03.387
Come on back in.

27:03.489 --> 27:04.521
OK.

27:04.624 --> 27:05.823
MARCI BOWERS (VOICEOVER):
I hadn't seen

27:05.925 --> 27:07.791
Jazz's vulva for several weeks.

27:07.893 --> 27:12.563
And even at that point,
it was tough to look at.

27:12.665 --> 27:16.900
And so we were relying on a
lot of healing to take place.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.836
It wasn't there
at the last photo.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.838
So you already sent
a picture to Dr. Ting?

27:20.940 --> 27:21.705
MARCI BOWERS: I did.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.240
And he's looking
at it right now.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.210
And I think we should conference
him, get him on the phone,

27:26.312 --> 27:27.244
and see what he has to say.

27:27.346 --> 27:28.178
Let's do it.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.413
MARCI BOWERS
(VOICEOVER): I defer

27:29.515 --> 27:31.515
to Dr. Ting on some
measures, like skin grafting,

27:31.617 --> 27:35.486
and the best ways to treat
those areas because Dr. Ting has

27:35.588 --> 27:38.355
much more experience
in traditional

27:38.457 --> 27:39.890
plastic surgical procedures.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.459
I do keep up, but I'm
not a classically-trained

27:42.561 --> 27:44.094
plastic surgeon per se.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.195
DOCTOR TING (ON
FACETIME): Hello.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.130
Hi, Dr. Ting.
MARCI BOWERS: How are you?

27:46.232 --> 27:47.097
Hi.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.232
MARCI BOWERS: I
have everyone here.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.168
So just-- I sent you the
picture of Jazz in her--

27:51.270 --> 27:53.170
in her current state.

27:53.272 --> 27:56.473
What-- what are
your impressions?

27:56.575 --> 27:57.341
Well, I'm shocked--

28:02.381 --> 28:04.682
but in a good way.

28:04.784 --> 28:05.749
MARCI BOWERS: Yeah, as am I.

28:05.851 --> 28:06.984
DOCTOR TING (ON
FACETIME): In the center,

28:07.086 --> 28:10.654
I can already see a-- a
thin layer of skin over it.

28:10.756 --> 28:13.924
That skin is going to thicken,
and mature, and change color.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.359
MARCI BOWERS: It looks amazing.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.361
It looks better than
what we do normally.

28:17.463 --> 28:18.162
Yeah, I don't know.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.296
How did that happen?

28:19.398 --> 28:21.331
MARCI BOWERS: The gods
were smiling, I think.

28:21.434 --> 28:23.200
GREG (VOICEOVER): There
was just a big sigh

28:23.302 --> 28:24.201
of relief in the room.

28:24.303 --> 28:25.202
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
It was almost,

28:25.304 --> 28:26.470
like, too good to be true--

28:26.572 --> 28:27.971
like, what, I wasn't
expecting that.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.740
I was expecting total opposite.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.375
Like, we were about
to step backwards.

28:31.477 --> 28:32.910
And now we might not have to.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.244
So good news.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.612
DOCTOR TING (ON FACETIME):
So if everything is centered,

28:35.715 --> 28:37.381
then there's really
no reason to--

28:37.483 --> 28:39.016
to intervene now.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.217
Yay.

28:40.319 --> 28:41.418
DOCTOR TING (ON FACETIME):
Let me-- let it heal.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.753
MARCI BOWERS: Uh-huh.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.689
Looking at that scar, she
might benefit from a-- a shot

28:45.791 --> 28:48.225
of cortisol to help soften it.

28:48.327 --> 28:51.195
You know, seeing her in
person would really be ideal.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.330
If you do this, um--

28:53.432 --> 28:57.835
the shot, would she be able to
travel home right after that?

28:57.937 --> 28:58.635
Oh, yeah.

28:58.738 --> 28:59.837
Yes.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.672
GREG: So there's no reason
to really stay up in New

29:01.774 --> 29:04.441
York for any period of time.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.176
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I'm just
so excited that I won't

29:06.278 --> 29:07.644
need this third operation.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.179
There's definitely
a sense of relief,

29:09.281 --> 29:12.483
because everything has
been going not too well

29:12.585 --> 29:14.051
throughout this entire process.

29:14.153 --> 29:17.688
And to know that I can finally
focus on recovering right now

29:17.823 --> 29:19.857
instead of worrying
about another procedure

29:19.959 --> 29:21.492
is really awesome.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.727
GREG: Is there
things she cannot do?

29:23.829 --> 29:26.797
Is there a recovery period?

29:26.899 --> 29:28.866
Her activity-- she should
be able to do everything now.

29:28.968 --> 29:29.967
She can exercise.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.101
She can walk.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.103
She can bathe and
shower normally.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.272
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I'm so eager
to get back to my normal life,

29:35.374 --> 29:38.208
because I have been waiting
for this for so long.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.511
And I'm finally at the
point where my body

29:40.613 --> 29:42.746
is capable of doing
everything that I was

29:42.848 --> 29:44.414
able to do before the surgery.

29:44.517 --> 29:46.550
I'm so glad to see that
you're feeling so well, Jazz.

29:46.652 --> 29:47.684
Yeah, thank you.

29:47.787 --> 29:48.886
JEANETTE: Thank you so much.

29:48.988 --> 29:49.720
DOCTOR TING (ON FACETIME):
Have a good night.

29:49.855 --> 29:50.320
GREG: All right.
JAZZ: Thank you.

29:50.422 --> 29:50.954
Bye.
- Bye.

29:51.056 --> 29:51.955
Thank you.
- Bye.

29:52.057 --> 29:53.524
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
I really feel

29:53.626 --> 29:55.058
like we've turned the corner.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.161
But I don't want to get my
hopes up too high, because we

29:57.263 --> 29:58.395
still have to visit Dr. Ting.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.063
But this is a
really good feeling,

30:00.166 --> 30:01.365
walking out of the
office knowing,

30:01.467 --> 30:04.668
hey, good news, she looks
great, and she doesn't

30:04.770 --> 30:06.236
need another skin graft.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.437
Hallelujah.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.273
Let me go for a run.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.775
(music playing)

30:14.580 --> 30:15.479
OK.

30:15.581 --> 30:16.947
I can't really run full speed.
But--

30:17.049 --> 30:17.748
JEANETTE: All right.

30:17.850 --> 30:18.816
Let's go.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.417
GREG: You might have
to work up to that.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.686
JEANETTE: Oh, lord.

30:22.788 --> 30:25.022
(music playing)

30:29.428 --> 30:30.594
Hey.

30:30.696 --> 30:31.495
Hey.

30:31.597 --> 30:32.296
What's up?

30:32.398 --> 30:33.130
I miss you.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.364
I miss you too.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.399
How's Philly?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.633
AHMIR (ON FACETIME): Philly--

30:36.735 --> 30:38.635
it could be better to be honest.

30:38.737 --> 30:39.503
You're good?

30:39.605 --> 30:40.804
You're staying at the house?

30:40.906 --> 30:43.674
She's not kicking you out
or anything crazy like that?

30:43.776 --> 30:44.575
Not yet.

30:44.677 --> 30:45.709
Hopefully she doesn't.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.978
And if she does,
you know, I think

30:48.080 --> 30:51.048
I could convince my dad to
take you in here if you can't

30:51.150 --> 30:52.683
find a place up there to stay.

30:52.785 --> 30:55.419
But it's not as bad,
you know, because nobody

30:55.521 --> 30:57.020
really talks about anything.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.188
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
I'm so relieved

30:58.290 --> 31:00.123
to hear that Ahmir is
able to stay at his house

31:00.226 --> 31:01.525
with his mother.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.827
But I feel really bad that
Ahmir is essentially choosing

31:03.929 --> 31:06.496
between me and his mom.

31:06.599 --> 31:08.098
And he's only known
me for one month.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.367
And his mom is his mom.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.236
I just worry
because I don't want

31:12.338 --> 31:15.172
to be the cause of him not
having a good relationship

31:15.274 --> 31:16.240
with her.
Yeah.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.908
I am coming to New
York soon though.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.877
So I'm excited to see you.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.078
I'm excited to go.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.279
I've been looking forward
to it this whole time.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.680
JAZZ: Yeah.

31:23.782 --> 31:26.049
Because Philly is so close to
New York, I was thinking maybe

31:26.151 --> 31:30.254
I could go to Philly
and, like, meet your mom.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.421
I know, like, that's--

31:31.523 --> 31:32.956
I mean, she'd have
to be down for it.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.191
But I want to meet your mom.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.128
I want her to change her mind.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.797
And I feel like I could
help her change her mind.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.399
That's a big step.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.569
I really want to be able
to improve your situation.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.272
And, like, I want to at least
try before we finally give up

31:48.374 --> 31:49.106
and surrender.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.174
I mean, I would want you to.

31:51.277 --> 31:53.543
But it's just, like,
the environment.

31:53.646 --> 31:55.445
I know how positive
you are and all that.

31:55.547 --> 31:58.982
And trust me, she can't
really bring you down.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.517
She can really
bring somebody down.

32:00.619 --> 32:01.718
JAZZ: Yeah.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.186
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I just
want to be able to resolve

32:03.289 --> 32:04.421
all of this conflict.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.758
I want him to be able to
stay at his home comfortably.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.893
And I want his mom
to be a mom and just

32:09.995 --> 32:12.896
accept her son for dating
whoever he wants to date.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.098
I just want you to come
back down in Florida though.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.302
Like, honestly, my 18th
birthday is coming up.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.771
And hopefully I could
plan something big.

32:20.873 --> 32:22.139
Are you excited
to be 18 though?

32:22.241 --> 32:23.507
Trust me, it's not fun.

32:23.609 --> 32:24.641
Nothing changes.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.243
But yeah.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.678
I figured nothing changes--

32:27.780 --> 32:30.380
except that I'm going
to make it change.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.615
I feel like I want
to be independent

32:31.717 --> 32:33.450
as soon as possible.

32:33.552 --> 32:36.453
I'm going to, like, try to
find an apartment with Ari.

32:36.555 --> 32:37.988
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): Ari
agreed to go out and look

32:38.123 --> 32:39.222
for apartments with me.

32:39.325 --> 32:42.059
And even though she's
not all in with the idea,

32:42.161 --> 32:43.293
I'm pushing this forward.

32:43.395 --> 32:46.930
Because I need her to be
on board in order for this

32:47.032 --> 32:48.131
actually happen.

32:48.233 --> 32:52.069
Maybe I can learn how
to, like, do all of that,

32:52.171 --> 32:54.237
like, buying an apartment,
how much it costs,

32:54.340 --> 32:57.407
understanding utilities,
and just all of that.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.943
At the end of the day,
it's-- it's your decision.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.746
When you turn 18,
everything is your decision.

33:02.848 --> 33:04.848
So we'll see how
that all goes down.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.917
But all I know is that
it's easier for you

33:07.019 --> 33:11.288
to live down here than to do
the whole long distance thing.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.457
And maybe I can
get you down here

33:13.559 --> 33:15.192
and we could have
a place to crash.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.126
That's a good thought.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.461
That's a good thought.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.096
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): If Ahmir
ended up coming down to Florida

33:19.198 --> 33:21.732
in order to escape the
situation with his mom,

33:21.834 --> 33:22.899
I'd be OK with it.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.634
But I don't think my
parents would be on board.

33:24.737 --> 33:26.803
If I had my own apartment,
he could come down and stay

33:26.939 --> 33:29.406
with me for a couple days
or maybe even a week or two

33:29.508 --> 33:31.408
so that he could
get out of Philly.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.877
Look, we're not that far
along in our relationship yet

33:33.979 --> 33:35.112
to be living together.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.180
But it's easier for you
just to get out of Philly

33:37.282 --> 33:38.715
and start fresh somewhere else.

33:42.688 --> 33:43.754
It's an idea.
It's idea.

33:43.856 --> 33:44.554
I have to think about it.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.090
OK.

33:47.192 --> 33:47.891
Whoa.

33:47.993 --> 33:48.892
REALTOR: Come on in.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.827
ARI: It's so nice.

33:50.929 --> 33:53.096
ARI (VOICEOVER): Jazz is
pretty blinded by her desire

33:53.198 --> 33:54.364
to want to move out.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.334
JAZZ: You saying no is the
reason why I'm saying yes.

33:57.436 --> 33:58.602
Then you should
move out right now.

34:14.520 --> 34:15.652
Hello.

34:15.754 --> 34:16.953
JAZZ: Hi.
I'm Jazz.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.188
Hi.

34:18.323 --> 34:19.523
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): Even though
Ari isn't ready to move,

34:19.625 --> 34:22.159
I'm hoping that the second
she sees an apartment

34:22.261 --> 34:24.894
and gets to explore with me,
it'll all become more real.

34:24.963 --> 34:29.299
And maybe she'll open up to the
idea of us moving out together.

34:29.401 --> 34:30.967
I'm on a mission right now.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.269
Here we go, girls.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.103
Whoa.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.271
REALTOR: Come on in.

34:34.373 --> 34:35.639
ARI: It's so nice.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.040
JAZZ: It's so nice.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.075
REALTOR This is the space.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.776
Look at the view of the water.

34:39.878 --> 34:40.844
REALTOR: Gorgeous, isn't it?

34:40.946 --> 34:42.546
ARI: Yes, very nice.

34:42.648 --> 34:46.783
It's been completely
updated and renovated.

34:46.885 --> 34:49.186
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): This
apartment is so, so, so nice.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.688
It is so clean,
organized, modern.

34:51.790 --> 34:53.824
It has a beautiful
view of the ocean.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.292
That's amazing.

34:55.394 --> 34:58.028
There is no way that Ari
wouldn't want to live here.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.397
REALTOR: This is
the master bedroom.

35:00.499 --> 35:03.600
From every room here,
there's an ocean view.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.268
So if you're laying
in bed, you're

35:05.370 --> 35:07.170
looking right at the ocean.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.573
And this is the second
bedroom, ladies.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.676
And as you could see, this
also has a direct ocean view.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.979
You can see all the way
up to the port from here.

35:16.081 --> 35:18.849
And they have lots of
amenities downstairs.

35:18.951 --> 35:21.918
They have a heated
swimming pool, sauna.

35:22.020 --> 35:22.719
That's really nice.

35:22.821 --> 35:23.520
I know.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.588
It's really nice.

35:24.723 --> 35:26.957
Now, this unit is
1,200 square feet.

35:27.059 --> 35:29.493
For the 1,200-square-foot
unit on the ocean,

35:29.595 --> 35:32.596
it's $2,500 a month.

35:32.698 --> 35:35.966
They usually get first, last,
and security for this unit.

35:36.068 --> 35:37.367
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
That's kind of a lot,

35:37.469 --> 35:38.602
a little bit out of budget.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.404
However, if Ari and I
were to move in together,

35:41.507 --> 35:42.873
then we would split the cost.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.908
And I hope that Ari
would be on board.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.910
I could get used
to this for sure.

35:47.012 --> 35:47.744
ARI: Yeah.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.080
This place is so, so nice.

35:50.182 --> 35:53.850
Yeah, it's definitely nicer
than anything I've ever se--

35:53.952 --> 35:55.252
been in, lived in.

35:55.354 --> 35:59.189
Coming here makes me
want to move so, so bad.

35:59.291 --> 36:03.360
Like, it's just so nice and, you
know, creating your own space.

36:03.462 --> 36:06.329
Like, I've never really had my
own space like that, you know?

36:06.431 --> 36:07.130
Yeah.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.365
Like, I don't know.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.000
I think we would
do well together.

36:10.102 --> 36:11.268
You might not know
this about me,

36:11.403 --> 36:16.206
but I usually do my dishes,
like, as I use the dish.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.607
That's nice.

36:17.709 --> 36:21.411
So it doesn't accumulate, and
then it's, like, a big chore.

36:21.513 --> 36:22.679
I'm a good person to live with.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.147
Hopefully you want me.

36:24.249 --> 36:25.949
It's not really about that.

36:26.051 --> 36:30.320
It's just whether it's logical
right now at this same time.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.055
Because it really is expensive.

36:32.157 --> 36:34.357
As much as I really do
miss my independence, like,

36:34.459 --> 36:36.960
I am saving so much money
by just living at home.

36:37.062 --> 36:38.195
And--

36:38.297 --> 36:39.829
I think you have more money
than you think you have.

36:39.932 --> 36:40.730
(chuckles)

36:40.832 --> 36:41.698
What?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.733
Did you really just say that?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.835
I think I know how
much money I have.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.137
Thank you though.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.206
ARI (VOICEOVER): It's slightly
overwhelming listening

36:49.308 --> 36:51.808
to Jazz trying to convince
me to move out with her,

36:51.910 --> 36:53.777
just because I feel like
I have more of a level

36:53.879 --> 36:55.579
head on the situation.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.714
I mean, do you want to
move with me or not really?

36:57.816 --> 36:58.682
I-- I don't know.

36:58.784 --> 36:59.583
It's beautiful though.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.117
And I could see myself here.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.954
But I don't have an
answer this second.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.989
I mean, when do you think
you're going to move out?

37:06.091 --> 37:09.259
I don't have a
time frame at all.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.061
Do you see it in
the near future or--

37:11.163 --> 37:12.862
It will be when I'm ready.

37:12.965 --> 37:13.930
And that's it.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.433
Like, it's-- there's
no time mark on it.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.768
ARI (VOICEOVER): Jazz's
pretty blinded by her desire

37:18.870 --> 37:20.270
to want to move out.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.372
She's being very
impulsive about it.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.708
And I think Jazz
might try to move out

37:24.810 --> 37:26.209
even if I don't move with her.

37:26.311 --> 37:29.246
But independence comes
with its pros and cons.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.082
So she'll definitely learn that.

37:32.184 --> 37:33.850
I mean, it's up to you.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.719
At the end of the
day, it's your life.

37:35.821 --> 37:38.788
Do what you want.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.291
(music playing)

37:43.862 --> 37:45.629
GREG: You looking forward
to going back to New York?

37:45.731 --> 37:46.796
I am now.

37:46.898 --> 37:49.733
GREG: At least it's not
as big of a procedure

37:49.835 --> 37:50.967
as it was going to be.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.636
Never say never.

37:52.738 --> 37:53.603
You're drained.

37:53.705 --> 37:54.871
It's been a long journey.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.539
JEANETTE: You know, I just
feel like I was blindsided

37:56.642 --> 37:59.376
so many times with
this whole journey

37:59.478 --> 38:02.112
that I don't trust
anything anymore.

38:02.214 --> 38:03.747
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
During this entire journey,

38:03.849 --> 38:06.383
we've had so many curve
balls thrown at us.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.018
Things change constantly.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.254
So it's terrible to say, but I
sometimes expect the worst now.

38:11.356 --> 38:13.523
And just because they said she
doesn't have to have surgery

38:13.625 --> 38:14.891
doesn't mean it
couldn't change again.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.027
Doctor Ting could look at her
and be like, oh, guess what,

38:17.129 --> 38:18.161
OR tomorrow.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.764
So I'm guarded at this point.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.032
Oh, hey, Jazz.

38:22.134 --> 38:26.670
To what do we owe the pleasure
of your company, Jazz?

38:26.772 --> 38:28.071
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I
respect Ari's decision

38:28.173 --> 38:29.606
not to move out right now.

38:29.708 --> 38:32.976
But seeing this nice,
fancy, new apartment

38:33.078 --> 38:35.945
has encouraged me
even more to move.

38:36.048 --> 38:39.215
I know my parents might
not be as supportive.

38:39.318 --> 38:41.785
But if I want to do this, then
I feel like I should do it.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.954
I wanted to talk to you
guys about something.

38:45.057 --> 38:46.489
I'm just thinking
about the possibility

38:46.591 --> 38:49.693
of maybe, like, moving.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.728
GREG: Off to a dorm at college?

38:51.830 --> 38:53.697
Like, about a year from now?

38:53.799 --> 38:56.966
I want to be able to exercise
a little bit more freedom

38:57.069 --> 38:59.569
and a little bit more control
in my life so by the time I do

38:59.671 --> 39:01.504
go to college, I
could be pu-- fully

39:01.606 --> 39:03.073
prepared for that lifestyle.

39:03.175 --> 39:06.443
Are we prohibiting you
from your independence?

39:06.545 --> 39:08.812
JEANETTE: Last I checked,
we were pretty lenient.

39:08.914 --> 39:09.979
Like, we're pretty cool parents.

39:10.082 --> 39:12.048
You do just about
everything you want.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.784
Does this have anything
to do with partners and--

39:14.886 --> 39:15.585
JAZZ: Ahmir?

39:15.721 --> 39:17.253
There is a benefit with Ahmir.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.222
But this-- that's
not, like, my reason.

39:19.324 --> 39:20.590
But there is a
benefit in that when

39:20.692 --> 39:22.959
he does come down to Florida,
he could stay at my place.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.662
And that makes it easy.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.864
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER): I
think Ahmir has a big role

39:27.999 --> 39:29.366
in her wanting to move out.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.234
If Ahmir doesn't
have a place to live,

39:31.336 --> 39:32.535
I feel really bad about that.

39:32.637 --> 39:34.237
But Jazz needs to
realize you don't live

39:34.339 --> 39:36.172
with somebody you're in a
relationship with unless you're

39:36.241 --> 39:37.273
very serious.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.341
Who's paying for this?

39:38.443 --> 39:39.275
Me.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.076
All me.

39:40.178 --> 39:41.911
That's a lot of loot.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.446
Then you have your
cell phone, because I'm

39:43.548 --> 39:45.448
not going to pay for that if
you're going to be independent.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.783
And I'm not going
to pay for a car--

39:46.885 --> 39:47.584
You don't have a car.

39:47.686 --> 39:48.651
GREG: --which costs money.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.320
And then insurance
for a car costs money.

39:50.422 --> 39:53.156
And then cable,
and then utilities.

39:53.258 --> 39:54.724
All those things add up.
- Food.

39:54.826 --> 39:55.792
And it's free here.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.160
GREG (VOICEOVER):
I don't think Jazz

39:57.262 --> 39:59.262
has the full picture of what
it takes to live on your own.

39:59.364 --> 40:01.231
I don't think she
understands all the expenses

40:01.333 --> 40:02.532
associated with it.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.868
There's a plethora
of things that

40:04.970 --> 40:07.003
really have just not
been something that she's

40:07.105 --> 40:08.671
been responsible for.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.407
I never handle
anything for myself.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.375
And I think I want to
start doing it for myself,

40:12.477 --> 40:13.610
being more independent.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.745
I got nothing against
you doing your own laundry,

40:15.847 --> 40:17.914
and making your bed in the
morning, and setting an alarm,

40:18.016 --> 40:18.782
and getting up early.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.116
Start doing it--

40:20.218 --> 40:21.217
now.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.051
GREG: There's nothing
that's stopping you

40:22.154 --> 40:23.086
form doing that stuff at home.

40:23.188 --> 40:23.853
JEANETTE: I can't
even get you to get

40:23.955 --> 40:24.888
out of bed in the morning.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.022
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
To be independent,

40:26.124 --> 40:28.291
you have to be very
mature in many ways.

40:28.393 --> 40:31.428
And there's certain ways
where she is not mature.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.529
I don't think
you realize this,

40:32.631 --> 40:34.264
but the second you
walk into my room,

40:34.366 --> 40:36.833
you give me a list of
commands for the day.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.235
You come in my room and be
like, get up, get up, get up.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.304
JEANETTE: Because I have to do
that for you to get out of bed.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.940
You're the type of
person who is on top

40:44.042 --> 40:44.941
of everything in my life.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.309
JEANETTE: I don't want to be.

40:46.411 --> 40:48.111
If you started waking up on your
own, I wouldn't go in there.

40:48.213 --> 40:51.781
Even if-- I think you'll
always be, if I'm living here.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.850
You're making my brain hurt.

40:53.985 --> 40:57.654
This is exactly what
I don't want though.

40:57.756 --> 40:58.721
Like, you don't understand.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.089
You're like, I need to
see all these things

41:00.192 --> 41:01.491
from you before I let you move.

41:01.593 --> 41:03.793
But all you're doing is
imposing your version

41:03.895 --> 41:05.895
of the best lifestyle upon me.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.664
JEANETTE: No, I want you to
come up with your version

41:07.766 --> 41:08.765
and just do something.

41:08.867 --> 41:09.966
Be productive.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.334
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I think
I'm making it very clear

41:11.436 --> 41:12.802
that I need more independence.

41:12.904 --> 41:15.138
And in my heart, I
know this is right.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.106
If my parents don't
start listening,

41:17.209 --> 41:19.976
then I'll have to take action.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.177
GREG (VOICEOVER):
I'm pretty adamant

41:21.279 --> 41:24.180
about my position
on Jazz not moving

41:24.282 --> 41:25.315
out at this point in time.

41:25.417 --> 41:27.116
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER):
Push comes to shove

41:27.219 --> 41:30.687
and Jazz decides,
that's it, I'm leaving,

41:30.789 --> 41:32.021
I will not be supportive at all.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.056
And she knows that.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.858
Just know that the--

41:34.993 --> 41:38.862
you saying no is the reason
why I'm saying yes right now.

41:38.964 --> 41:40.129
Then you should
move out right now.

41:45.537 --> 41:46.870
(music playing)

41:46.972 --> 41:48.738
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): Next
time on "I Am Jazz--"

41:48.840 --> 41:50.306
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER): We
have another interview

41:50.408 --> 41:52.242
with Juju Chang
for "ABC Nightline"

41:52.344 --> 41:54.210
to finish telling Jazz's story.

41:54.312 --> 41:55.411
JAZZ: Then there
was a complication.

41:55.514 --> 41:58.548
I had to go back in
for another procedure.

41:58.650 --> 42:00.817
JEANETTE (VOICEOVER): Jazz tends
to get very graphic regarding

42:00.919 --> 42:02.185
her surgical complications.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.020
I'm the one that's going to
get phone calls from people--

42:04.122 --> 42:05.188
JAZZ: It's hard when
you're in a in--

42:05.323 --> 42:07.857
--and e-mails from people
getting all pissed off.

42:07.959 --> 42:11.361
JAZZ: I'm going to New York for
my post-op and cortisone shot,

42:11.463 --> 42:13.596
but also this bra campaign
that I'm a part of.

42:13.698 --> 42:17.567
How did you enter creating of
bra when you don't wear them?

42:17.669 --> 42:18.902
(laughter)

42:19.004 --> 42:20.503
Ahmir's mom has been
like, why are you

42:20.605 --> 42:22.972
dating a man, my son's gay now.

42:23.074 --> 42:26.676
The fact that Ahmir's mom is
not accepting is a problem.

42:26.778 --> 42:27.810
I want to meet her.

42:27.913 --> 42:29.245
AHMIR: I don't really
think it's a good idea.

42:29.347 --> 42:30.947
But she said that she
would do a phone call.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.415
(phone ringing)

42:32.517 --> 42:34.517
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I'm anxious
to talk to Ahmir's mom.

42:34.619 --> 42:38.021
I want to understand from
you what the problem is if he

42:38.123 --> 42:39.055
is dating someone transgender.

42:39.157 --> 42:40.490
AHMIR'S MOM (ON PHONE):
I have a problem

42:40.559 --> 42:43.526
with dealing with, oh, well, now
it's-- this is who I am today.

42:43.628 --> 42:44.861
He wasn't that person yesterday.

42:44.963 --> 42:46.462
He's not telling you the truth.

42:46.565 --> 42:47.764
JAZZ: What truth is
he not telling me?

42:47.866 --> 42:48.898
Get off the phone now.

42:49.000 --> 42:49.899
Get off the phone, girl.
JAZZ: Wait, wait, no.

42:50.001 --> 42:50.900
Wait.

42:51.002 --> 42:52.101
AHMIR'S MOM (ON
PHONE): Wait a minute.

42:52.203 --> 42:52.635
No, get off the phone, girl.
Get off the phone.

42:52.771 --> 42:52.869
JAZZ: Ahmir.

42:56.708 --> 42:59.609
Spoiler alert-- are you ready
for a behind-the-scenes look

42:59.711 --> 43:01.044
at the latest episode?

43:01.146 --> 43:02.979
Make sure you're all
caught up on the new season

43:03.081 --> 43:04.480
of "I Am Jazz."

43:04.583 --> 43:06.849
(music playing)

43:13.291 --> 43:14.958
Once I'm 18, I could
be independent,

43:15.060 --> 43:16.993
but legally live
alone at the same time

43:17.095 --> 43:18.428
and be living my life.

43:18.530 --> 43:20.029
I want to look for
apartments, and try

43:20.131 --> 43:23.199
to get a glimpse of what
the pricing looks like,

43:23.301 --> 43:24.534
and how to live
independently on my own.

43:24.636 --> 43:26.169
And, like--
(snickers)

43:26.271 --> 43:27.604
What?
It's true.

43:27.706 --> 43:29.272
JAZZ (VOICEOVER): I have
been thinking about moving

43:29.374 --> 43:30.907
out for a long time.

43:31.009 --> 43:32.942
At the beginning
of 2018, I remember

43:33.044 --> 43:34.410
we traveled to Los Angeles.

43:34.512 --> 43:37.046
And I was like, maybe I
should move out here one day.

43:37.148 --> 43:39.248
There's a lot of
opportunities for me here.

43:39.351 --> 43:41.417
I could see myself
in California.

43:41.519 --> 43:43.319
And since then, I've always
had this idea that maybe

43:43.421 --> 43:44.120
I'm going to move out.

43:44.222 --> 43:46.456
(music playing)

43:48.426 --> 43:50.460
I mean, do you want to
move with me or not really?

43:50.562 --> 43:51.427
I-- I don't know.

43:51.529 --> 43:52.295
It's beautiful though.

43:52.397 --> 43:53.763
And I could see myself here.

43:53.865 --> 43:57.100
But I don't have an
answer this second.

43:57.202 --> 43:59.168
Later on, I thought
that maybe California

43:59.270 --> 44:00.536
was too big of a move.

44:00.639 --> 44:03.339
So I wanted to move with my
sister, who had recently come

44:03.441 --> 44:05.208
back down to south Florida.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.309
Here we go, girls.

44:06.411 --> 44:07.143
Whoa.

44:07.245 --> 44:07.977
REALTOR: Come on in.

44:08.079 --> 44:09.646
ARI: It's so nice.

44:09.748 --> 44:11.047
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
That's the reason

44:11.149 --> 44:14.217
why I want to get a place the
most-- so I could decorate it.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.319
JEANETTE: Oh, different
than my style?

44:16.421 --> 44:17.720
Yeah.

44:17.822 --> 44:20.123
I mean, I just want to be able
to design my own environment.

44:20.225 --> 44:21.457
I want it to be
almost like a cave,

44:21.559 --> 44:23.326
but like a magical,
mystical cave.

44:23.428 --> 44:26.262
Like I see-- if I close
my eyes and vision it,

44:26.364 --> 44:27.830
I see a lot of things
hanging from the ceiling.

44:27.932 --> 44:31.134
Maybe, like, tapestries or,
like, canopy-type thing-- very,

44:31.236 --> 44:33.136
like, gypsy sort of feeling.

44:33.238 --> 44:34.337
Sounds like a dorm room to me.

44:34.439 --> 44:35.805
With pretty-- yeah.

44:35.907 --> 44:36.939
With lights.

44:37.042 --> 44:38.574
And then all my crystals
would be everywhere--

44:38.677 --> 44:39.909
like, a giant meditation room.

44:40.011 --> 44:40.943
OK.

44:41.046 --> 44:41.944
So when you graduate
from high school--

44:42.047 --> 44:42.578
Imagine how peaceful
that would be.

44:42.681 --> 44:43.646
--you'll move.

44:43.748 --> 44:44.447
And you'll have that.

44:44.549 --> 44:46.883
(music playing)

44:54.526 --> 44:58.227
AHMIR: My mom is not actually
as accepting as I originally

44:58.363 --> 44:59.028
thought she would be.

45:04.636 --> 45:09.872
JAZZ: So, like,
what has she said?

45:09.974 --> 45:11.808
A lot of-- like,
she didn't acknowledge

45:11.910 --> 45:13.109
you for who you were.

45:13.211 --> 45:15.778
So it was still like,
she would say "he,"

45:15.880 --> 45:19.582
and, that's a man
because he's born a man.

45:19.684 --> 45:20.383
And--

45:20.485 --> 45:21.384
So she misgendered me?

45:21.486 --> 45:22.819
Yeah.

45:22.954 --> 45:23.953
JAZZ (VOICEOVER):
When I found out

45:24.055 --> 45:26.055
that Ahmir's mom
was misgendering me

45:26.157 --> 45:28.024
and that she wasn't
supportive, I didn't

45:28.126 --> 45:29.425
really know what to think.

45:29.527 --> 45:31.494
It wasn't directly
affecting me, because I

45:31.596 --> 45:32.462
don't know this woman.

45:32.564 --> 45:34.097
She wasn't talking to my face.

45:34.199 --> 45:35.598
And she's not
involved in my life.

45:35.700 --> 45:37.633
But the fact that Ahmir
has to deal with someone

45:37.736 --> 45:41.037
who is questioning his sexuality
and who he is as a person

45:41.139 --> 45:43.906
simply because he's dating
someone who's transgender--

45:44.008 --> 45:45.308
I just felt bad for him.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.744
And I wanted to support
him in that situation.

45:47.846 --> 45:49.345
And I thought the
best way that I could

45:49.447 --> 45:52.715
support him is by talking
to his mom and being like,

45:52.817 --> 45:54.383
hey, give us a
chance, look, it's

45:54.486 --> 45:55.518
not cool what you're doing.

45:55.620 --> 45:57.887
And I kind of wanted
to be like a mediator

45:57.989 --> 45:59.689
and mend the relationship.

45:59.824 --> 46:03.292
But I feel like there is
deep-rooted conflict there

46:03.394 --> 46:07.063
that comes down to her
character as a person.

46:07.165 --> 46:11.701
So I need to talk to you
guys about my boyfriend.

46:11.803 --> 46:13.603
We're all ears.

46:13.705 --> 46:17.807
So Ahmir's parents aren't
really accepting of the fact

46:17.909 --> 46:20.009
that I'm transgender--

46:20.111 --> 46:22.078
or at least his mom isn't.

46:22.180 --> 46:25.414
She referred to me as
a "man," saying, why--

46:25.517 --> 46:27.650
why are you dating a man,
I'll never accept that.

46:27.752 --> 46:29.786
Yeah, I've always worried that
Jazz was going to be involved

46:29.888 --> 46:32.588
with somebody who had friends
and family that weren't

46:32.690 --> 46:34.924
accepting, because so many
people are not accepting

46:35.026 --> 46:36.392
of transgender individuals.

46:36.494 --> 46:38.528
And I've always in
the back of my mind

46:38.630 --> 46:40.796
hoped that Jazz would
end up with somebody

46:40.865 --> 46:42.465
who was surrounded
by others that were

46:42.567 --> 46:45.868
LGBTQ-inclusive and allies.

46:45.970 --> 46:51.107
And this woman just isn't at
any of those things at all.

46:51.209 --> 46:52.875
Sometimes, I wonder
if it's something

46:52.977 --> 46:55.878
that could get in the way of
our relationship long-term.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.947
Because what if I am
looking for someone

46:58.049 --> 47:01.751
who has a family that is fully
integrated with our family?

47:01.853 --> 47:04.420
Because that's something
important to not just you

47:04.522 --> 47:06.022
as a mother, but to me as well.

47:06.124 --> 47:08.191
You want to be able to--

47:08.293 --> 47:09.625
what's the word you use?

47:09.727 --> 47:12.195
Of the spouse's mother?

47:12.297 --> 47:13.129
Yeah, (non-english).

47:13.231 --> 47:13.930
(non-english).

47:14.032 --> 47:14.964
(non-english).

47:15.066 --> 47:17.099
So basically, what
(non-english) is,

47:17.202 --> 47:21.404
is if I had a partner,
the mother of my partner--

47:21.506 --> 47:24.307
your relationship with her--
you two are (non-english),,

47:24.409 --> 47:25.408
the two--
- Right.

47:25.510 --> 47:26.809
--the two mothers.
Because there's no--

47:26.911 --> 47:28.144
Right.

47:28.246 --> 47:29.078
The two mothers, or the two
fathers, or the two parents.

47:29.180 --> 47:29.512
There's no word
like "mother" in--

47:29.614 --> 47:30.746
Right.

47:30.849 --> 47:32.481
There's no "mother" and
"mother-in-law"-ish person--

47:32.584 --> 47:35.852
there just isn't an English
word for your relationship to,

47:35.954 --> 47:40.156
you know, the in-laws, your
in-laws, whoever they may be.

47:40.258 --> 47:42.191
But anyway, with
Ahmir, you know, there is

47:42.260 --> 47:43.726
no (non-english) relationship.

47:43.828 --> 47:45.595
She's not really supportive.

47:45.697 --> 47:46.863
Not really.

47:46.965 --> 47:47.697
She thinks you're a man.

47:47.799 --> 47:50.466
