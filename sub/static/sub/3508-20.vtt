00:00.329 --> 00:01.308
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.335 --> 00:02.935
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.269 --> 00:04.995
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.233 --> 00:06.255
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.656 --> 00:07.256
Who am I?

00:07.345 --> 00:08.484
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.485 --> 00:08.885
Castle.

00:08.919 --> 00:09.579
Castle.

00:09.580 --> 00:11.580
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.726 --> 00:13.916
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.126 --> 00:14.945
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.000
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:16.035 --> 00:17.941
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:17.987 --> 00:19.473
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.474 --> 00:20.474
I get to be on her case.

00:20.508 --> 00:22.451
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.486 --> 00:23.362
And together, we catch killers

00:24.310 --> 00:25.298
we make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.299 --> 00:26.299
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.433 --> 00:27.127
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.090
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:29.572 --> 00:31.291
and did you hear?

00:31.676 --> 00:34.048
Our favorite golfer
is in the news again.

00:34.987 --> 00:36.758
Missed a charity tournament
over the weekend.

00:37.116 --> 00:38.181
Really unfortunate

00:38.301 --> 00:40.866
The world's top golfer
had to pull out.

00:41.113 --> 00:43.453
In fact, it's the first time
he's pulled out of anything

00:43.573 --> 00:46.650
In five years.

00:46.651 --> 00:49.032
Ouch. Ouch. What do you think,
Hank? Should I take a mulligan?

00:49.152 --> 00:51.414
No, play through, Bobby. Play through.
I will, my friend.

00:51.534 --> 00:53.129
We have a great show
for you tonight.

00:53.249 --> 00:54.814
Mr. Castle.
Ellie Monroe is here. She has
a new movie opening tomorrow.

00:54.934 --> 00:56.529
Hi, I'm Kayla.
Please follow me.
Sure.

00:57.236 --> 00:59.614
And my favorite writer
Richard Castle's joining us.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.217
Here you go, Mr. Castle.

01:02.337 --> 01:03.819
Deb, the makeup artist,
will take care of you from here.

01:03.939 --> 01:04.681
Thank you, Kayla.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.209
And you're up
right after Ms. Monroe.

01:08.697 --> 01:09.941
Hi, it's Ellie.

01:10.224 --> 01:11.119
Rick.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.226
Can I just say...
wow.

01:13.346 --> 01:15.002
Like, I can't believe
I'm meeting you right now.

01:15.122 --> 01:15.704
Really?

01:15.824 --> 01:17.848
Well, you're, like,
my favorite author ever.

01:18.168 --> 01:20.414
I mean, I've read "Heat Wave "
at least three times.

01:20.534 --> 01:22.150
Can I tell you, I have seen
every movie you've ever been in?

01:22.270 --> 01:22.985
Really?

01:23.105 --> 01:25.197
Oh. Not "Viper Mountain"
I hope.

01:25.317 --> 01:26.188
Yes, "Viper Mountain."
ugh.

01:26.308 --> 01:27.592
You were
the best thing in that movie.

01:27.605 --> 01:30.907
As soon as that snake ate you,
whole movie fell apart.

01:31.630 --> 01:34.217
Folks, please help me
in welcoming Richard Castle.

01:34.337 --> 01:38.088
Rick Castle.

01:38.089 --> 01:39.524
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Whoo!

01:39.525 --> 01:40.467
Oh, he looks good.

01:40.587 --> 01:42.007
<i>Welcome.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:42.127 --> 01:44.623
First of all, congratulations
on "Heat Wave "--

01:44.743 --> 01:46.311
"New York Times"
best seller.

01:46.431 --> 01:47.136
Thank you.
And you know what?

01:47.256 --> 01:49.140
I really loved writing it.

01:49.260 --> 01:51.419
Well, the paperback comes out,
uh, July 27th, right?

01:51.539 --> 01:52.482
July 27th. That's right.

01:52.602 --> 01:54.463
And it's being made into a movie.
Nice.

01:54.583 --> 01:58.379
<i>Now you worked with actual</i>
<i>NYPD Homicide Detectives</i>

01:58.380 --> 01:59.814
<i>to research "Heat Wave ."</i>

01:59.815 --> 02:00.690
<i>Yes, yes, I did.</i>

02:00.810 --> 02:02.649
And--and they still
won't let me carry a gun.

02:04.359 --> 02:05.923
I didn't know you worked
with law enforcement.

02:06.983 --> 02:08.892
It's kinda my weak spot.
Hello.

02:09.139 --> 02:11.467
Waiter, check please.

02:11.587 --> 02:13.116
Well, you guys
are single, right?

02:13.236 --> 02:14.810
Well, actually,
not anymore, Bobby.

02:14.930 --> 02:15.982
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

02:16.102 --> 02:17.384
<i>Oh.</i>

02:17.504 --> 02:19.115
<i>Wow. The camera really does</i>
<i>add 10 pounds...</i>

02:20.193 --> 02:21.043
to his ego.

02:21.163 --> 02:22.224
<i>Call me old-fashioned--</i>

02:22.344 --> 02:23.591
<i>When a beautiful movie star</i>
<i>is impressed with</i>

02:23.711 --> 02:25.600
<i>my fake law enforcement</i>
<i>credentials, I'm in.</i>

02:25.720 --> 02:27.352
Do you think he's
asked her out yet?

02:27.472 --> 02:29.802
Your father,
pretty girl like that?

02:29.922 --> 02:31.580
He may have proposed
by now.

02:31.700 --> 02:32.998
And that's our show for tonight.

02:33.118 --> 02:35.068
Stay tuned for
"Late Talk with Mickey Reed."

02:35.364 --> 02:37.434
I'm Bobby Mann.
Remember, folks...

02:37.554 --> 02:40.297
The boys'll
be back on duty tomorrow night.

02:45.313 --> 02:46.902
I always wonder
what they're saying

02:47.022 --> 02:48.057
when they lean in like that.

02:48.177 --> 02:49.745
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

02:50.105 --> 02:51.614
They want me dead.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.660
I'm sorry. What?
I'm serious.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.643
You work with cops, right?
They want--

02:55.763 --> 02:57.494
That was
a great show, guys.

02:57.614 --> 02:59.213
I'm so sorry
about segment three.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.382
Next time we put the emu in a diaper.
Mm-hmm.

03:01.652 --> 03:04.087
I'll call you.
Oh, the box-in-box with Justin...

03:04.088 --> 03:06.023
Yeah.
Looked great.
I loved it.

03:06.024 --> 03:08.458
Good, good.
Listen, I think we should...

03:13.040 --> 03:16.831
Um... you're going
orienteering not librarying.

03:16.832 --> 03:18.978
You sure you want to take
that many books?

03:19.777 --> 03:21.335
Overambitious
for a 5-day trip?

03:21.336 --> 03:23.653
You're gonna be responsible
for your own pack.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.510
I think you're supposed
to be more Sacagawea

03:26.630 --> 03:28.008
than a scholarly reader.

03:28.009 --> 03:29.736
Besides,
look at all those pages.

03:29.856 --> 03:32.311
The trees might want revenge.
Richard.

03:33.617 --> 03:34.491
What's wrong?

03:35.739 --> 03:37.266
Bobby Mann is dead.

03:37.886 --> 03:39.099
What? What happened?

03:39.354 --> 03:40.908
They're saying he had
a heart attack.

03:46.695 --> 03:49.263
I'm telling you, the guy said
that somebody wanted him dead,

03:49.264 --> 03:51.733
and then he ends up dead.
That can't be a coincidence.

03:51.734 --> 03:53.702
Bobby Mann had a history
of heart disease,

03:53.703 --> 03:55.538
and on the autopsy reports,

03:55.539 --> 03:57.976
it states that the cause
of death was a heart attack.

03:58.661 --> 03:59.754
That can't be
a coincidence either.

03:59.874 --> 04:01.023
Did Lanie do the autopsy?

04:01.143 --> 04:02.570
No, but she sent it
to me.

04:03.578 --> 04:04.835
Okay, a guy
was walking his dog,

04:04.955 --> 04:07.102
saw Mr. Mann collapse
on the sidewalk alone.

04:07.484 --> 04:09.206
But there'no puncture wounds,
no bruising,

04:09.326 --> 04:10.810
and the tox panel
came back negative.

04:10.930 --> 04:12.251
There's no foul play,
Castle.

04:15.909 --> 04:17.329
I talked to his producer
this morning.

04:17.449 --> 04:20.298
She said that Mann
left the studio at 12:45

04:20.418 --> 04:23.263
in his Bugatti Veyron.
That's a $2-million car.

04:23.383 --> 04:26.233
He collapsed on foot
a few blocks from his house

04:26.353 --> 04:28.071
at 4:50
so?

04:29.081 --> 04:29.919
So where's the car?

04:30.039 --> 04:31.336
He's, like,
a gazillionaire, Castle.

04:31.456 --> 04:33.185
He probably just parked it
and expected someone else

04:33.305 --> 04:34.380
to pick it up
the next morning.

04:35.612 --> 04:38.256
In my book "Gathering Storm,"
the former KGB official

04:38.376 --> 04:39.848
killed with
an undetectable poison

04:39.968 --> 04:41.659
that stopped the heart.

04:41.913 --> 04:42.942
What if that's
what happened to Mann?

04:43.062 --> 04:45.640
Need I remind you that you
make up stuff for a living,

04:46.182 --> 04:48.151
and there is no such poison
in real life,

04:48.152 --> 04:50.316
and if there was,
there would be a whole slew

04:50.436 --> 04:52.657
of angry spouses who'd be
getting away with murder?

04:52.777 --> 04:55.044
Could you just have Lanie
take a closer look?

04:55.823 --> 04:57.014
Please.

04:59.961 --> 05:02.499
You know how many strings
I had to pull for this Castle?

05:02.729 --> 05:04.643
If I'm wrong,
I'll reimburse the city.

05:05.031 --> 05:07.013
To hell with the city
it's me you're gonna owe.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.206
I take spa certificates,
jewelry and cash.

05:09.326 --> 05:10.327
Duly noted. What's that?

05:10.447 --> 05:13.173
The contents of Bobby Mann's
pockets when he was bought in.

05:14.553 --> 05:15.563
I'm gonna go check
on the Labs.

05:15.683 --> 05:16.893
Okay.

05:18.211 --> 05:19.441
What are you doing?

05:19.442 --> 05:21.878
It's called investigating.
You should try it.

05:22.245 --> 05:24.179
I usually wait
until there's a crime.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.349
Cell phone, ney clip.

05:27.015 --> 05:28.459
He stuck a piece of gum
to a paper

05:28.579 --> 05:29.875
before he put it
in his pocket.

05:29.995 --> 05:32.159
One of his last acts
was <i>not</i> littering.

05:32.279 --> 05:34.587
Yes, but there's a word
on this paper--"tory."

05:34.820 --> 05:36.333
Could be a mystery woman.

05:36.631 --> 05:38.887
Wow, Castle.
Cracking this case wide open.

05:38.888 --> 05:40.688
Hey, it's his idea notepad.

05:40.689 --> 05:42.648
This is a joke from last night.
"charity golf.

05:42.768 --> 05:44.569
First time he's pulled out in years."
do you realize

05:44.689 --> 05:46.503
that you are now
investigating a heart attack?

05:48.541 --> 05:49.561
Hmm.

05:49.562 --> 05:50.696
What?

05:50.697 --> 05:51.832
His signature line
of 20 years,

05:51.952 --> 05:53.557
"the boys'll be back
on duty tomorrow night,"

05:54.133 --> 05:55.279
Looks like he was thinking
of changing it.

05:57.668 --> 05:59.802
"the crew will be back
on duty tomorrow night."

05:59.803 --> 06:01.262
Maybe he was trying
to make it hipper.

06:01.382 --> 06:02.432
Mm.

06:03.072 --> 06:04.492
We should have
a signature line.

06:05.753 --> 06:07.441
She's armed, he's dangerous.

06:09.110 --> 06:09.852
No.
No.

06:09.972 --> 06:10.896
How about

06:11.016 --> 06:12.766
a whole new chapter
in crime solving?

06:13.238 --> 06:13.881
Ooh.

06:14.001 --> 06:15.605
Chapter. Get it?

06:16.005 --> 06:16.522
No.

06:16.642 --> 06:19.849
Okay, I ran
every extra tox screen

06:19.969 --> 06:21.784
outside of standard protocol.

06:21.785 --> 06:24.883
All negative, no trace of any
known poisonous substance.

06:25.003 --> 06:25.802
Okay, Castle?

06:25.922 --> 06:27.083
Don't forget to tip your M.E.

06:27.203 --> 06:28.537
on the way out.
Ah, not so fast.

06:28.758 --> 06:29.953
Secondary tox panel

06:30.073 --> 06:32.639
detected traces of Tyramine,
which is harmless,

06:32.956 --> 06:35.014
but it's presence raised
a red flag for me.

06:35.134 --> 06:36.464
So I ran some more tests.

06:36.821 --> 06:38.829
Bobby Mann was taking Phenelzine.

06:39.063 --> 06:39.840
Phenelzine?

06:39.960 --> 06:42.236
A prescription drug for depression.
So?

06:42.356 --> 06:44.526
So Phenelzine
is in a class of drugs

06:44.646 --> 06:46.033
called M.A.O. Inhibitors

06:46.153 --> 06:47.770
That have powerful
contra-indicators.

06:47.890 --> 06:49.324
You mean drug interactions?

06:49.444 --> 06:51.878
In this case,
interactions that can kill.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.146
M.A.O. Inhibitors
contra-indicate

06:54.147 --> 06:57.048
with anything fermented--
wine, beer,

06:57.049 --> 06:58.107
certain kind of cheeses.

06:58.227 --> 07:01.284
Even the smallest amount can
trigger a hypertensive crisis.

07:01.285 --> 07:03.853
Oh! Almost like an undetectable
poison that stops the heart.

07:03.854 --> 07:05.374
Which doesn't mean
that he was murdered.

07:05.494 --> 07:07.908
He could've accidentally eaten or drank
something he shouldn't have.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.773
That's what I thought. So I ran
the contents of his intestines.

07:11.227 --> 07:12.543
In the hours
prior to his death,

07:12.663 --> 07:14.181
he ingested three substances--

07:14.301 --> 07:16.279
Something sugary,
like hard candy...

07:16.399 --> 07:17.170
or chewing gum.

07:17.290 --> 07:18.144
There you go.

07:18.264 --> 07:21.445
Also cranberry juice
and balsamic vinegar.

07:21.565 --> 07:22.768
Which is fermented.

07:22.888 --> 07:24.705
And there was no trace
of anything

07:24.706 --> 07:26.173
that you would find
balsamic on--

07:26.174 --> 07:28.528
No chicken, no fish
no pasta.

07:29.110 --> 07:29.894
Just the cranberry juice.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.593
Which could've easily
masked the color

07:31.713 --> 07:33.137
and the taste
of the balsamic vinegar.

07:33.257 --> 07:33.876
So you're saying

07:33.996 --> 07:35.847
that somebody knew about
Bobby Mann's condition,

07:35.967 --> 07:37.676
slipped balsamic vinegar
into his cranberry juice,

07:37.796 --> 07:39.327
knowing that
it would kill him?

07:39.447 --> 07:40.573
This was no accident

07:41.054 --> 07:42.846
Bobby Mann was murdered.

07:43.804 --> 07:45.886
Well, Bobby, you were right.

07:56.596 --> 07:58.746
Don't you
just <i>love</i> poisoning?

07:58.866 --> 08:01.060
Especially a poisoning
without poison.

08:01.291 --> 08:02.886
Whoever did this
was very smart.

08:03.181 --> 08:04.513
They chose a murder weapon
that's probably

08:04.633 --> 08:06.448
in half the kitchens
in the city.

08:06.568 --> 08:07.725
Good thing we're smart, too.

08:07.845 --> 08:08.655
Thanks.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.041
That was Lanie.

08:10.389 --> 08:12.704
Based on possible rates of
fatal M.A.O. interactions,

08:12.824 --> 08:15.036
she was able to narrow
the window of poisoning to

08:15.156 --> 08:16.811
between 1:30 and 4:30
in the morning.

08:16.921 --> 08:18.321
That makes

08:19.631 --> 08:20.480
this...

08:22.399 --> 08:25.746
our kill zone--
1:30 to 4:30.

08:26.583 --> 08:27.154
What else?

08:27.274 --> 08:29.454
Well, the lab said that there
was no traces of cranberry juice

08:29.549 --> 08:32.015
or balsamic vinegar in the gum
we found in Mann's pocket.

08:32.275 --> 08:34.302
So he must have chewed that
before he was poisoned.

08:34.422 --> 08:36.135
Well, we know he left
the studio at 12:45.

08:36.255 --> 08:37.693
Which means
he wasn't poisoned there.

08:37.813 --> 08:39.568
And we know that his
home security records

08:39.688 --> 08:40.871
show that he never
made it there.

08:40.991 --> 08:43.208
12:45 to 4:50 in the morning,

08:43.328 --> 08:45.040
leaves in his car,
is found on foot.

08:45.787 --> 08:47.228
So what was he doing
that whole time?

08:47.610 --> 08:48.853
So the vehicle locator

08:48.973 --> 08:50.744
in Mann's Bugatti
is not sending a signal.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.735
Probably in
an underground parking garage.

08:52.855 --> 08:53.980
Which means
it could be anywhere.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.903
Check his cell phone, see if
he made any calls last night,

08:57.023 --> 08:59.008
And then go to his Brownstone.
Castle and I will head

08:59.128 --> 09:00.946
to the studio and see
what we can dig up there.

09:01.066 --> 09:02.463
Oh, guys.
Yeah.

09:03.070 --> 09:04.256
No talk of murder.

09:04.376 --> 09:05.291
The longer we can keep this

09:05.411 --> 09:06.719
away from the press,
the better off we'll be.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.090
I'm sorry.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.370
I don't know where he went
after the show last night.

09:11.540 --> 09:13.228
What is this about anyway?
I thought Bobby...

09:13.984 --> 09:15.358
Died of
a heart attack, right?

09:15.478 --> 09:17.358
We're just tying up loose ends
for the coroner.

09:17.666 --> 09:20.015
How was Mr. Mann
acting recently?

09:20.135 --> 09:21.289
Did you notice
anything unusual?

09:21.647 --> 09:23.076
No. He was great.

09:23.817 --> 09:26.591
Uh... except yesterday.

09:26.592 --> 09:29.093
What happened yesterday?
I don't know.

09:29.094 --> 09:31.762
I mean, he spent the morning
locked up in his office alone.

09:31.763 --> 09:32.899
And then the rest of the day,

09:33.601 --> 09:35.364
he was agitated
and he was acting weird.

09:35.365 --> 09:37.766
Weird how?
Paranoid.

09:37.767 --> 09:39.723
At one point he asked me
if I had heard anything,

09:39.843 --> 09:42.581
and I said, "about what?"
and he just shrugged it off.

09:43.105 --> 09:45.539
Were you aware that he was on
powerful antidepressants?

09:46.642 --> 09:48.771
I mean, he tried to be
very private about it,

09:48.891 --> 09:50.980
but when he went on them,
he had to quit drinking,

09:51.100 --> 09:52.533
and people wondered why.

09:52.653 --> 09:53.996
So word got around.

09:54.116 --> 09:55.866
You don't think that's
what killed him, do you?

09:56.222 --> 09:57.565
Something he ate or--
or drank?

09:58.206 --> 09:59.524
He was very careful.

09:59.644 --> 10:01.003
Like I said,
we're just following up.

10:03.157 --> 10:06.002
I keep looking over
at that curtain, you know,

10:06.995 --> 10:08.692
waiting for him
to walk through...

10:09.533 --> 10:12.561
like this was all
one big publicity stunt.

10:12.831 --> 10:14.296
The two of you
were close, right?

10:14.416 --> 10:15.674
Since before all this.

10:15.958 --> 10:18.262
Since we were just
kids together back in 'Nam.

10:18.669 --> 10:21.137
So he would've told you
if there was anything wrong?

10:21.138 --> 10:22.100
Like what?

10:23.098 --> 10:25.087
Like if he was concerned
for his well-being.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.019
What's this all about?

10:26.139 --> 10:27.793
I-I thought he died
of a heart attack.

10:28.101 --> 10:30.047
Just routine questioning,
Mr. McPhee.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.667
You know, some of the people
said that he seemed

10:31.787 --> 10:33.416
a little agitated recently.

10:34.304 --> 10:36.484
Come to think of it,
he was a little preoccupied.

10:37.016 --> 10:39.250
I asked him about it
after the show last night,

10:39.251 --> 10:40.721
but he insisted he was fine.

10:41.453 --> 10:42.439
Hank.

10:43.154 --> 10:44.622
Man, I am so sorry.

10:44.742 --> 10:45.979
Aw.

10:46.534 --> 10:48.037
Nightmares really happen.
Huh?

10:49.479 --> 10:50.295
Yeah. You know Mickey--

10:50.415 --> 10:52.109
Host of "Late Talk,"
right after our show?

10:52.229 --> 10:53.664
Yes, of course.
I'm a big fan.

10:53.665 --> 10:55.241
I love your whole
"booty roulette" gag.

10:55.361 --> 10:56.547
That's great. I'm Rick.
Castle.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.099
Ah. Saw you
on the show last night.

10:58.219 --> 10:59.843
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
Nice to meet you.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.744
So do either of you know
where Bobby went

11:01.864 --> 11:02.779
after the show last night?

11:02.899 --> 11:05.292
We're trying to track his last
hours for the coroner's report.

11:06.318 --> 11:07.173
No clue.

11:07.716 --> 11:10.241
I think he said something about
going to see his ex-wife.

11:10.907 --> 11:12.769
Did he say which one?
Mnh-mnh.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.241
How many ex-wives
did he have?

11:14.361 --> 11:18.698
6, ranging in ages
from 25 to 50.

11:19.572 --> 11:22.073
It seems every five years, he
traded in for the latest model.

11:22.193 --> 11:24.609
So he didn't so much
marry them as lease them.

11:24.954 --> 11:26.334
So I ran all their names
through the system,

11:26.454 --> 11:27.760
and guess what popped up.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.421
Seems wife number five here
was arrested

11:30.541 --> 11:32.710
over an altercation with Bobby
at a restaurant Uptown.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.814
She's got crazy eyes.

11:35.085 --> 11:37.274
Well, there's more. According
to the doorman in her building,

11:37.533 --> 11:39.652
Bobby Mann was there
last night after the show.

11:39.772 --> 11:42.070
Mrs. Mann, when was the last
time you saw your ex-husband?

11:43.132 --> 11:44.065
About a year ago...

11:45.615 --> 11:46.787
in court.

11:47.049 --> 11:49.061
He took out a restraining order
against me.

11:50.102 --> 11:51.397
Well, according to
the complaint,

11:51.398 --> 11:52.781
you did threaten to kill him.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.749
Well, I don't really remember
what was said.

11:56.076 --> 11:58.305
"I wish you were dead,
you little weasel."

11:58.306 --> 12:01.623
He was dating a younger woman,
and she looked just like me.

12:02.009 --> 12:03.122
Tell that
to his previous wife.

12:03.242 --> 12:05.340
Were you aware of
his dietary restrictions?
Sure.

12:05.460 --> 12:08.038
Nothing fermented or it could
give him a heart attack.

12:08.991 --> 12:11.419
Why? You think I had
something to do with it?

12:11.539 --> 12:12.638
You tell me, Mrs. Mann.

12:13.353 --> 12:14.400
Acording to your doorman,

12:14.520 --> 12:15.998
Bobby showed up
at your building last night.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.287
He did?

12:17.407 --> 12:19.138
Cindy,
we know you saw him.

12:19.258 --> 12:20.893
How do you know he wasn't
there to see Barbara?

12:21.224 --> 12:22.141
Barbara?

12:22.261 --> 12:23.238
His first wife.

12:23.925 --> 12:25.834
She's got an apartment
in the building, too.

12:26.929 --> 12:29.014
We both got 'em
in the divorce settlement.

12:29.134 --> 12:30.529
Bobby co-owned the building.

12:30.932 --> 12:32.386
Yeah,
I saw Bobby last night.

12:33.101 --> 12:35.035
He came by
around 1:00 in the morning,

12:35.036 --> 12:36.309
woke me up as usual.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.136
Did he often surprise you
in the middle of the night?

12:39.606 --> 12:41.586
I was the one woman
who fell in love with him

12:41.706 --> 12:43.606
before all the fame
and the money.

12:44.443 --> 12:46.592
Whenever he felt insecure,
he came around.

12:47.602 --> 12:49.204
Mostly it was
the same old stuff--

12:49.814 --> 12:52.763
his ratings were down
or... he was getting old.

12:54.730 --> 12:55.728
But last night...

12:56.942 --> 12:57.720
What?

12:58.417 --> 12:59.427
It was different.

12:59.656 --> 13:01.648
He looked... haunted.

13:02.689 --> 13:04.305
He said
something was going on,

13:04.425 --> 13:05.459
something awful.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.839
What was going on?
He wouldn't tell me.

13:08.396 --> 13:11.263
He asked me if I thought
he was a good person.

13:12.015 --> 13:13.900
And I held his hand
and I said, "Bobby,

13:14.434 --> 13:15.913
"you're a lousy husband,

13:16.973 --> 13:18.106
but you're a hell of a man."

13:20.373 --> 13:21.582
Then he left.

13:23.100 --> 13:23.925
At what time?

13:25.263 --> 13:26.655
Around quarter after 1:00.

13:28.305 --> 13:29.574
Did he say
where he was going?

13:30.281 --> 13:31.169
No.

13:33.283 --> 13:34.913
I thought he was going home.

13:36.531 --> 13:38.020
Something awful
was going on.

13:38.021 --> 13:40.022
He knew
someone was after him.

13:40.023 --> 13:42.189
But he doesn't tell his ex-wife
or his best friend.

13:42.309 --> 13:43.248
Instead he tells me.

13:43.642 --> 13:46.120
Maybe it's because he knew
you were working with the cops.

13:46.565 --> 13:48.118
Tell me I'm a good person?

13:48.685 --> 13:50.845
Like he was doing something
he was ashamed of.

13:50.965 --> 13:53.066
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

13:53.067 --> 13:55.034
Neighbors confirm
Barbara Mann's story.

13:55.035 --> 13:58.134
One of them saw Bobby leave
her apartment at 1:15 A.M.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.722
That's outside of
our kill zone, which means

13:59.842 --> 14:02.050
we need to figure out
where he went to next.

14:02.679 --> 14:04.490
Let's canvass
all the garages in the area,

14:04.610 --> 14:05.871
see if we can find
Mann's car.

14:05.991 --> 14:07.573
And let's also look into
his financials

14:07.693 --> 14:08.985
for the usual secrets--

14:09.105 --> 14:10.894
drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Yeah.

14:11.014 --> 14:12.176
Okay.

14:15.331 --> 14:16.132
Hello.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.469
Ellie? Hi.

14:18.589 --> 14:20.523
Ellie Monroe,
from the show.

14:20.524 --> 14:22.555
Yeah.
No, I know.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.072
I understand.

14:24.962 --> 14:26.434
No, I think that's
a-a great idea.

14:27.464 --> 14:28.364
Yeah.

14:28.599 --> 14:29.959
Okay, I'll meet you there.

14:30.334 --> 14:31.467
Bye.

14:32.603 --> 14:34.236
Ellie Monroe, huh?

14:34.237 --> 14:37.654
Yeah, she's pretty upset about
this whole Bobby Mann thing,

14:37.774 --> 14:39.349
That we were
his last guests.

14:39.657 --> 14:40.987
She thinks
it would be comforting

14:41.107 --> 14:42.971
if we were to be together.
"comforting"?

14:43.091 --> 14:45.570
Is that what the cool kids
call it these days?

14:47.066 --> 14:48.046
Wow.

14:48.367 --> 14:49.476
You are so cynical.

14:50.519 --> 14:51.936
You know,
sometimes after a tragedy,

14:52.056 --> 14:55.109
two human beings just need
to--to be with each other

14:55.229 --> 14:57.854
just for no other reason
than to show each other

14:57.974 --> 14:59.651
some understanding
and support.

15:00.838 --> 15:02.519
Mm! Mm.
Mm.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.354
Mm.

15:04.355 --> 15:07.923
Mm. I'm just glad
I can be comforting.

15:07.924 --> 15:09.424
Ahh.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.128
Oh! Yes.

15:15.635 --> 15:16.990
Good morning, Detective.

15:19.738 --> 15:20.526
Really?

15:21.282 --> 15:22.236
What?

15:22.237 --> 15:24.219
Lose the "I just got laid"
voice, all right?

15:24.557 --> 15:25.691
What are you talking about?

15:25.811 --> 15:28.069
I am a trained Detective,
so don't bother denying it.

15:29.042 --> 15:29.957
Okay, fine.

15:30.773 --> 15:32.152
Oh, so now you're not
denying it?

15:32.806 --> 15:34.173
You just told me not to.

15:36.582 --> 15:38.955
Hey, guys.
Any news on the car?

15:39.284 --> 15:41.516
Nothing at any of the garages
near Barbara Mann's building.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.566
So we checked
restaurant valets in the area.

15:43.820 --> 15:46.053
Bobby paid the guy
at Mozart's 100 bucks

15:46.314 --> 15:48.297
to keep it close
while he ran up to his ex.

15:48.417 --> 15:50.141
Witness says he left
a little before 1:30.

15:53.121 --> 15:55.671
61st and Central Park West.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.931
Where did he go after that?

15:59.051 --> 16:00.962
Maybe check
traffic cams in the area.

16:01.082 --> 16:02.140
A guy
in a sports car like that

16:02.260 --> 16:03.766
might have blasted through
some red lights..

16:03.886 --> 16:05.725
Yeah. It's a bit of a hail Mary,
but it's worth a try

16:05.845 --> 16:07.116
Maybe we don't need
traffic cams.

16:07.236 --> 16:08.360
Why not just
the man on the street?

16:08.480 --> 16:10.809
I mean, a celebrity
in a Bugatti Veyron? Come on.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.354
People aren't
just gonna notice that.

16:12.474 --> 16:15.927
They are going to talk about it,
or more specifically, Tweet.

16:16.047 --> 16:17.701
And...

16:17.702 --> 16:18.802
Booyah.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.371
37 A.M. Bobby Mann F.T.W.

16:21.372 --> 16:23.323
"just saw him driving
some spaceship car

16:23.443 --> 16:25.615
into a garage
at Broadway and 57th."

16:25.735 --> 16:26.699
Ooh.
On it.

16:29.039 --> 16:30.061
"F.T.W."?
"for the win."

16:30.181 --> 16:33.742
It means, uh, "my Tweet
kicks your Tweet's butt."

16:33.862 --> 16:35.741
Come on, Beckett. You gotta keep
up. Hang with the cool kids.

16:36.118 --> 16:37.651
<i>♪ how much I feel ♪</i>

16:37.652 --> 16:39.119
<i>♪ feel for you, baby... ♪</i>

16:39.120 --> 16:41.221
<i>(am</i> I believe this is for you.

16:42.756 --> 16:45.591
Um, I'll just--
um, I'll just take that.

16:45.592 --> 16:48.093
I'm just gonna... take that.
Mm-hmm.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.095
Pardon me one sec.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.263
Hey, Ellie.

16:52.264 --> 16:53.764
Yes, yes.

16:53.765 --> 16:55.917
Last night was great,
wasn't it?

16:56.907 --> 16:58.188
Yeah, I'd love to.

16:58.603 --> 17:00.140
Tonight? Sure.

17:01.052 --> 17:02.247
All right.
I'll see you then.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.281
More comforting?

17:06.440 --> 17:07.843
Uh--

17:07.844 --> 17:09.676
Parking garage
at 1525 Broadway confirms

17:09.678 --> 17:11.612
Bobby Mann
pulled in at 1:37 A.M.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.513
and he never came back
for his car.

17:13.515 --> 17:15.281
And what's at 1525 Broadway?

17:15.282 --> 17:17.284
The ParkVview Penthouse
of Mickey Reed,

17:17.285 --> 17:19.271
the gregarious and affable
host of "Late Talk."

17:19.854 --> 17:21.627
Oh, Mickey...
Not so fine.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.435
Doorman let Bobby up
to his flat 1:45 A.M.

17:24.555 --> 17:26.249
Neighbors complained of
a loud argument.

17:26.368 --> 17:27.728
Bobby left
a little after 2:00.

17:27.848 --> 17:29.211
So Mickey lied to us.

17:29.331 --> 17:32.599
He saw Bobby somewhere right
in the middle of our kill zone.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.077
You think he was
a good host,

17:35.367 --> 17:36.568
offered Bobby a drink?

17:43.400 --> 17:45.134
This set looks like
an old-age home.

17:45.857 --> 17:49.002
<i>Everything</i> needs to be
updated--no purple, no suede,

17:49.434 --> 17:52.002
no faux finish--and get rid
of this stupid thing.

17:52.122 --> 17:53.789
Measuring drapes already,
Mr. Reed?

17:54.478 --> 17:55.871
Like it or not, Detective,

17:56.200 --> 17:57.433
the network
wants me to take over

17:57.553 --> 17:59.847
Bobby's time slot next week
right after the tribute.

18:00.652 --> 18:01.736
I know it seems callous,

18:02.830 --> 18:03.945
but it's what Bobby
would've wanted.

18:04.314 --> 18:06.088
Even over his dead body.
Excuse Me?

18:06.208 --> 18:08.343
Why did you lie to us about
seeing Mann the other night?

18:11.679 --> 18:13.180
Ay.

18:13.181 --> 18:15.148
Look, I'm sorry,

18:15.149 --> 18:17.278
but I lied because I didn't
want it getting out.

18:17.398 --> 18:18.411
that you two were fighting?

18:18.633 --> 18:20.967
It's hard enough filling
the man's shoes around here.

18:21.087 --> 18:23.333
I don't need the tabloids
writing out us getting into it

18:23.453 --> 18:24.671
on the night he died.

18:25.164 --> 18:28.108
So I lied. So what?
So you lied to a cop.

18:28.725 --> 18:30.692
Let's be realistic.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.411
The guy died from
a heart attack, right?

18:33.761 --> 18:34.464
What?

18:34.759 --> 18:36.009
It was a heart attack
that was a result

18:36.129 --> 18:38.563
of toxins in his system,
toxins that he ingested

18:38.564 --> 18:40.798
somewhere around the time
that you saw him.

18:40.799 --> 18:44.174
So you guys
are saying I killed Bobby?

18:44.939 --> 18:46.501
Why?
Well, it's no secret,

18:46.621 --> 18:48.251
you were supposed to get
his 11:30 slot,

18:48.485 --> 18:50.111
But Bobby
extended his contract.

18:50.577 --> 18:51.710
Maybe you couldn't wait.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.396
You sound as demented as Bobby.
What do you mean?

18:54.618 --> 18:56.762
Last time I saw him,
we're best of pals, right?

18:57.181 --> 18:59.415
The other night he comes over,
he's ranting and raving,

18:59.416 --> 19:01.395
talking about
what a disloyal punk I've been.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.083
Why?
Man, I don't know.

19:03.319 --> 19:05.117
All he kept saying was,
he knew things.

19:05.522 --> 19:07.272
And I'm like, "Bobby,
what are you talking about?"

19:07.654 --> 19:09.995
He storms out saying
I knew what I'd done.

19:12.726 --> 19:15.993
C.S.U.'s at Mickey's apartment
running a sweep for our toxin.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.733
Killing the king of late-night
to take his throne--

19:17.734 --> 19:18.709
It's very "Richard III."

19:18.829 --> 19:20.497
It appeals to the writer in me.
Did you want a bite of this?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.034
Hell, I'll sick God on you!
And you?

19:25.947 --> 19:27.656
I don't ever want to see you
on my network again.

19:27.776 --> 19:29.726
You're banned! And you?!

19:30.416 --> 19:31.562
I don't know you.

19:32.691 --> 19:35.155
You're all a bunch of nobodies!
I could buy this precinct!

19:38.324 --> 19:40.324
Howard Weisberg,
President of the network.

19:40.325 --> 19:41.685
He just found out about
the search warrant

19:41.805 --> 19:42.781
for Mickey Reed.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.122
And he also found out that we
think Bobby Mann was murdered.

19:45.242 --> 19:45.751
How?

19:45.871 --> 19:47.883
Breaking news
on a <i>different</i> network.

19:48.003 --> 19:50.495
The guy got scooped on his
own star's murder.

19:50.717 --> 19:52.146
So much for keeping
the press out.

19:52.266 --> 19:53.563
You two better be right
about all this.

19:57.539 --> 19:59.362
Text giggling? Really?

20:00.297 --> 20:02.491
It's Alexis.
She just saw a loon feeding.

20:02.611 --> 20:04.052
Funny. So did I.

20:04.172 --> 20:07.769
Hey. So... Mann's Bugatti
is still in the garage.

20:07.889 --> 20:09.528
They won't let us touch it
without a search warrant.

20:09.848 --> 20:10.784
$2-million car.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.177
Apparently, it's worth me
than their insurance policy.

20:13.297 --> 20:14.553
You re they ar't
joyriding?

20:14.673 --> 20:16.414
All right, check with the judge.
Mm-hmm.

20:18.308 --> 20:19.624
Okay.
If his car is still in the garage,

20:20.408 --> 20:21.738
where'd he go
after Mickey's place?

20:22.139 --> 20:24.037
Well, it couldn't have been
very far.

20:24.862 --> 20:26.741
Hey, Ryan.
Did Mickey's doorman mention

20:26.861 --> 20:28.542
in what direction Mann was headed
when he left?

20:29.733 --> 20:31.018
Uh...
South.

20:31.467 --> 20:32.451
South.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.188
South on Broadway
from 57th.

20:35.308 --> 20:36.518
That's the theater district.

20:36.638 --> 20:38.391
At 2:00 in the morning?
There's nothing playing then.

20:38.511 --> 20:39.496
Well, there'diners,
there's clubs,

20:39.616 --> 20:40.437
there's restaurants.

20:40.557 --> 20:42.001
Well, other than the poison
and the gum,

20:42.121 --> 20:43.433
we know he didn't eat
or drink anything.

20:47.315 --> 20:49.417
Maybe "tory" is a place
he went.

20:49.537 --> 20:52.850
Uh, conservatory,
inventory, purgatory--

20:52.851 --> 20:55.651
Factory! The Comic Factory.
Mann was a comedian.

20:55.652 --> 20:56.629
He went to a comedy club.

20:56.749 --> 20:58.769
Comic Factory is on, uh,
55th and Broadway.

20:58.889 --> 21:01.356
That's two blocks South.
He put his gum in a--

21:01.357 --> 21:02.399
in a piece of paper from
a comic factory flyer.

21:02.519 --> 21:03.007
You're right.

21:03.127 --> 21:04.990
Then from the forenics, we know
he didn't have the cranberry

21:05.110 --> 21:06.644
or the balsamic
before he spit it out.

21:06.764 --> 21:10.846
So he was poisoned either
<i>at</i> or <i>after</i> the club.

21:11.607 --> 21:13.333
Then Mickey Reed
didn't kill Bobby.

21:13.334 --> 21:15.301
He's not our guy.

21:15.302 --> 21:16.365
Hey, guys.

21:16.937 --> 21:18.488
How do you feel about
going to see a little comedy?

21:20.005 --> 21:21.964
The guy's got the most
recognizable face in comedy.

21:22.084 --> 21:22.703
Yeah, I know.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.662
Look, I got a call
on the club phone.

21:25.009 --> 21:26.743
The caller I.D.'s
from Bobby's show.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.444
A guy asks about
one of my comedians.

21:28.445 --> 21:30.846
Couple hours later, guy shows up
to see that comedian,

21:30.847 --> 21:32.781
but he's got
a funny looking moustache

21:32.782 --> 21:35.450
and he's wearing a baseball cap.
It looked like Bobby.

21:35.451 --> 21:37.412
Did he talk to anyone?
Did he have a drink?

21:37.532 --> 21:38.934
No. He sat in the back,

21:39.054 --> 21:41.322
left his drink ticket,
and bolted out the side

21:41.323 --> 21:43.323
after watching the comedian
he came to see.

21:43.324 --> 21:45.525
Anything special about
this particular comedian?

21:45.526 --> 21:46.567
Angel Santana,

21:47.461 --> 21:49.429
the proverbial rising star?

21:50.503 --> 21:52.832
I'm assuming you know about
the incident that night?

21:52.833 --> 21:55.169
What incident?

21:55.170 --> 21:57.123
I'm Angel Santana.
Good night, y'all.

22:00.997 --> 22:02.000
Ms. Santana.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.415
I'm Detective Esposito.
This is Detective Ryan.
Hey.

22:04.535 --> 22:05.696
Oh, hey.
Thanks for coming.

22:05.816 --> 22:08.333
The officer I talked to did not
instill a lot of confidence.

22:08.453 --> 22:09.628
You want to tell us about it?

22:09.748 --> 22:11.624
Not much to tell.
During my set that night,

22:11.744 --> 22:13.210
someone smashed
my bike's taillight,

22:13.211 --> 22:14.380
banged up the fenders

22:14.500 --> 22:16.524
and scratched "late-night bitch"
into the tank.

22:16.914 --> 22:18.127
I mean,
what does that even mean?

22:18.386 --> 22:19.865
Actually, we're not here
about your bike.

22:20.136 --> 22:22.267
Ms. Santana, did you know
Bobby Mann?

22:22.821 --> 22:24.386
You mean personally?
No. Why?

22:24.506 --> 22:26.407
Well, because he came to see
your act

22:26.527 --> 22:27.492
on the night he was killed.

22:27.612 --> 22:29.464
Any idea why?
Wow.

22:29.858 --> 22:32.692
He probably trashed my bike.
I've heard stories about him.

22:32.693 --> 22:34.519
I know guys he's blackballed
just because they did

22:34.639 --> 22:35.957
his competitors' show.

22:36.077 --> 22:38.145
Is there any reason why he might
have wanted to come after you?

22:38.265 --> 22:40.463
His producer tried to book me
on his show last month,

22:40.771 --> 22:41.967
but Mickey Reed
wanted me, too.

22:42.290 --> 22:45.050
I had to pick.
Mickey felt more like my vibe.

22:46.290 --> 22:48.162
Club owner said
Bobby left at 2:30,

22:48.282 --> 22:50.134
and the bartender confirms
he didn't drink anything.

22:50.254 --> 22:54.543
Which leaves us...
Two hours left to account for

22:54.544 --> 22:56.735
and a whole lot
of strange behavior.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.866
Why would Bobby go see
a comedian

22:58.986 --> 23:01.070
who didn't want to do his show
and then bust up her bike?

23:01.390 --> 23:03.534
Aren't famous people crazy
and narcissistic?

23:03.654 --> 23:05.136
I don't know.
Gotta ask Castle.

23:05.419 --> 23:06.849
Where is Castle anyway?

23:07.321 --> 23:09.255
Mm. Mm. mm.

23:09.256 --> 23:12.357
Ah. Mm.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.357
I'm gonna need
some new shirts.

23:14.358 --> 23:15.991
No shirts.

23:17.293 --> 23:18.726
mm. Mm.

23:20.762 --> 23:22.396
Good morning.

23:22.813 --> 23:24.585
It's okay, Castle.
You don't have to pretend

23:24.705 --> 23:26.365
to not be in a good mood
for my sake.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.278
Why should I
be in a good mood?

23:29.586 --> 23:30.940
I mean... I'm a writer.

23:31.060 --> 23:33.575
We... famously brood.

23:33.695 --> 23:36.107
We... I should brood more.

23:36.108 --> 23:37.366
You want to brood?

23:38.656 --> 23:41.311
Forensics on
Angel Santana's motorcycle

23:41.558 --> 23:42.480
are a bust.

23:42.849 --> 23:44.192
There's no fingerprints.
Nothing.

23:44.312 --> 23:46.481
We have no idea
where Mann was after 2:30.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.688
What about his car?

23:49.046 --> 23:51.149
Ryan and Esposito
got a warrant this morning.

23:51.269 --> 23:53.897
But seeing that he was poisoned
after he parked it,

23:54.017 --> 23:55.678
chances are
we won't find anything.

23:55.798 --> 23:57.391
And his financials
were clear.

23:57.958 --> 23:58.969
He pays more in alimony

23:59.089 --> 24:01.433
in a day than I make
in an entire year.

24:01.553 --> 24:03.207
There's no red flags
on his phone records.

24:03.327 --> 24:04.981
And I reinterviewed
all of his colleagues.

24:05.101 --> 24:07.519
No one has any idea
why he was acting so paranoid.

24:07.639 --> 24:10.281
You're not paranoid if someone's
actually trying to kill you.

24:12.092 --> 24:14.359
Hey, Tony! How's my favorite
movie mogul?

24:16.149 --> 24:17.074
Yes. Right?

24:17.562 --> 24:18.547
She'd be perfect for Nikki.

24:19.212 --> 24:20.629
Yes.
Perfect.

24:21.957 --> 24:22.992
Thank you.

24:25.273 --> 24:27.207
That's a "Heat Wave "
producer.

24:28.447 --> 24:29.851
That wasn't about
Ellie Monroe, was it?

24:30.418 --> 24:32.007
Yeah, why?
Oh.

24:32.989 --> 24:33.963
What?

24:34.323 --> 24:36.005
That's why she was
throwing herself at you.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.333
She wanted you to
recommend her for the part.

24:39.035 --> 24:39.741
What?

24:39.861 --> 24:41.895
Oh, and for the record,
she's nothing like Nikki Heat.

24:41.896 --> 24:44.459
Oh, you just can't stand it
that a beautiful actress

24:44.579 --> 24:46.726
is actually interested in me.
Why would I care?

24:46.846 --> 24:48.980
Exactly. That's a good question.
Why would you care?

24:49.402 --> 24:51.936
I don't.
<i>Fine.</i> I'm gonna go
get some coffee.

24:51.937 --> 24:53.308
Fine. I've got work to do.

24:55.741 --> 24:57.675
Break room's that way.

24:57.676 --> 24:59.376
Desk.
Beckett.

24:59.377 --> 25:01.378
Castle.
Check this out.

25:02.178 --> 25:03.914
We just finished the sweep
of Bobby's car.
Mm-hmm.

25:03.915 --> 25:06.282
First off, the Bugatti--
<i>holy shift.</i>

25:06.283 --> 25:08.007
When you start this thing,
you can feel it right in--

25:08.127 --> 25:10.053
<i>But</i> as exciting
as the car is,

25:10.475 --> 25:12.656
I think we figured out why
Bobby Mann was so tweaked.

25:12.776 --> 25:14.861
We found this
in his glove compartment.

25:15.512 --> 25:18.530
That's Kayla. She's an intern
at Bobby's show.

25:19.155 --> 25:21.194
Looks like she was
doing more than interning.

25:21.195 --> 25:22.541
You should check out
the back.

25:23.397 --> 25:24.741
"If they find out,
you're dead."

25:25.199 --> 25:27.366
Blackmail, death threats
and scandal.

25:27.367 --> 25:29.302
That explains why his behavior
was so erratic.

25:29.422 --> 25:31.216
And probably
why he was killed.

25:33.157 --> 25:33.990
It was last week.

25:34.528 --> 25:36.029
I stayed late to help Bobby
with some bits.

25:36.734 --> 25:38.262
Do you have any idea
who took that, Kayla?

25:39.041 --> 25:40.483
Must be someone
who works on the show.

25:40.744 --> 25:42.531
Who just happened
to have a camera

25:42.651 --> 25:44.627
and managed to catch
the two of you in the act?

25:44.747 --> 25:46.169
Or were they
tipped off maybe?

25:48.007 --> 25:49.017
Were you blackmailing Bobby?

25:49.420 --> 25:51.808
Oh, my God. No.
He's three times your age,

25:51.928 --> 25:53.717
and you are an intern
on the show.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.584
That adds up to embarrassment
and scandal,

25:56.704 --> 25:58.260
which I'm sure
he'd pay a lot to avoid.

25:58.380 --> 25:59.689
No, I would never do that.

26:01.197 --> 26:02.096
We were in love.

26:02.872 --> 26:04.080
In love? Really?

26:04.200 --> 26:06.679
And... how long were
the two of you together?

26:07.616 --> 26:09.042
Three weeks
this past Monday.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.675
Um...

26:12.327 --> 26:13.331
Who else knew?

26:13.969 --> 26:16.162
No one. Bobby and I
kept it a secret.

26:17.497 --> 26:19.014
We didn't want my mom
to find out.

26:20.225 --> 26:20.989
Your mom?

26:21.279 --> 26:22.203
Who's your mom?

26:22.323 --> 26:24.524
He was banging my daughter
right under my nose?

26:24.644 --> 26:26.700
I will kill him!
He's already dead.

26:26.820 --> 26:27.906
Well, I will kill him again.

26:28.026 --> 26:29.617
I don't care.
Where's the corpse?

26:29.737 --> 26:30.640
Ms. Marks, we just--

26:30.760 --> 26:32.941
Kayla, my office, now!
Move it!

26:33.939 --> 26:35.245
Mom, you don't understand--
Move It!

26:35.365 --> 26:37.093
You realize, if this gets out,

26:37.213 --> 26:38.584
it'll destroy
Bobby's reputation.

26:38.704 --> 26:41.211
We're not trying to add to
an already difficult situation.

26:41.331 --> 26:42.418
We're just trying to find
the killer.

26:42.538 --> 26:43.564
Bobby wasn't an angel,

26:43.684 --> 26:45.634
but you look at the man
in his entirety.

26:45.754 --> 26:47.346
He deserves to be remembered
with grace.

26:47.466 --> 26:51.162
This business gets clouded
by money, fame, ambition.

26:51.590 --> 26:53.647
The only thing that Bobby
really cared about

26:53.886 --> 26:55.093
was making people laugh.

26:55.783 --> 26:58.087
Well, whoever took this
either works for this show

26:58.207 --> 26:59.861
or had access
to this building.

26:59.981 --> 27:01.634
And maybe it was someone
in a financial jam

27:01.754 --> 27:03.260
who was looking to score
a quick buck.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.248
Or maybe it's someone
with a grudge against Bobby.

27:06.305 --> 27:07.688
I can't imagine
anyone doing that.

27:07.808 --> 27:09.356
He was a great boss.
Everyone loved him.

27:09.476 --> 27:11.993
Yeah, and apparently,
he loved them back.

27:13.765 --> 27:16.475
Okay. Uh, Janine can get you
a list of everyone on the crew

27:16.595 --> 27:18.323
once she's done
yelling at Kayla.

27:18.683 --> 27:19.385
Poor kid. Who knows?

27:19.505 --> 27:20.839
She might have ended up
being number seven.

27:20.959 --> 27:23.165
Excuse me.

27:23.697 --> 27:24.594
Beckett.

27:26.404 --> 27:27.192
What have we got?

27:28.030 --> 27:30.170
Well, once we
suspected blackmail,

27:30.290 --> 27:31.698
I ran through
his financials again.

27:31.818 --> 27:32.832
I thought they were clean.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.960
Well, they were,
but going back, we found this.

27:37.830 --> 27:40.121
He spent 100 grand
on a kitchen Reno.

27:40.343 --> 27:42.684
Totally legitimate,
but we searched his Brownstone--

27:42.804 --> 27:44.921
and he wasn't renovating
his kitchen.

27:45.041 --> 27:46.822
So who was on the receiving end
of the 100 grand?

27:47.519 --> 27:49.324
Zach Robinson.

27:49.444 --> 27:51.484
Ooh. Good bad-guy name.

27:51.604 --> 27:55.277
Snakey "z," hard "k."
even has "rob" in it.

27:55.278 --> 27:56.501
Good bad-guy rap sheet, too.

27:56.621 --> 27:58.054
Former lowlife
private investigator.

27:58.374 --> 27:59.347
I remember this guy.

27:59.467 --> 28:01.609
He had some celebrity clients
back in the day.

28:01.924 --> 28:03.324
He was known for
digging up dirt on folks

28:03.444 --> 28:05.007
and turning it into
a personal payday.

28:05.127 --> 28:07.744
He did a nickel on
multiple counts of extortion,

28:07.864 --> 28:10.283
wire tapping, racketeering
and blackmail.

28:10.403 --> 28:11.699
Well, Robinson must have
gotten the picture

28:11.819 --> 28:12.802
from somebody on the inside.

28:12.922 --> 28:14.547
Sure. Figured it was worth
a fast buck.

28:15.543 --> 28:16.947
But if Bobby paid,
why would he kill him?

28:17.067 --> 28:19.362
Bobby figured out that
Robinson was a blackmailer,

28:19.482 --> 28:20.962
and then he threatened
to take him to the cops.

28:21.082 --> 28:22.724
Bobby pushes,
Robinson pushes back harder.

28:22.844 --> 28:24.942
Let's go pick him up.
Easier said than done.

28:25.062 --> 28:27.222
Esposito already ran down
his last known address.

28:27.342 --> 28:28.890
Robinson's in the wind.

28:29.010 --> 28:29.986
Well, let's keep looking.

28:30.106 --> 28:31.025
Yeah.

28:32.292 --> 28:34.602
You are a bad man,
Zach Robinson.

28:35.644 --> 28:38.508
A dirty, naughty,
no-good blackmailer.

28:39.161 --> 28:41.219
Do you do all your
interrogations in bed,

28:41.339 --> 28:42.256
Detective Heat?

28:42.376 --> 28:43.873
You think this is funny,
Robinson?

28:43.993 --> 28:45.519
Hmm?
Okay, okay.

28:45.639 --> 28:46.840
No, I'll do
whatever you want, Nikki.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.698
Okay. That's more like it.

28:50.728 --> 28:51.828
Mm.

28:53.602 --> 28:54.711
Oh.

28:55.969 --> 28:57.755
Mm.

28:58.876 --> 29:01.020
Mm. You are so sweet.

29:02.557 --> 29:03.685
And brilliant.

29:03.805 --> 29:04.411
Guilty.

29:04.531 --> 29:07.380
Mm. What are you thinking?

29:09.243 --> 29:10.049
Nothing.

29:10.484 --> 29:11.310
It's ridiculous.

29:11.556 --> 29:13.651
What? Come on. Tell me.
I want to know what goes on

29:13.771 --> 29:15.523
inside that incredible mind
of yours.

29:16.737 --> 29:18.450
Well, since you put it
that way.

29:20.310 --> 29:22.833
I have this... friend
at work

29:22.953 --> 29:24.792
who thinks that the only reason
you're with me is,

29:24.912 --> 29:25.969
you know...

29:26.971 --> 29:28.337
for the part in the movie.

29:30.841 --> 29:31.642
Wow.

29:32.110 --> 29:34.007
Really?

29:35.818 --> 29:38.177
What does this friend
of yours base that on?

29:39.928 --> 29:41.234
You know what? I'm--
I'm sorry.

29:41.354 --> 29:42.501
I shouldn't
have repeated that.

29:42.621 --> 29:44.251
Does this friend know me?
No.

29:44.371 --> 29:46.678
Has he read anything about me
that would make him think

29:46.798 --> 29:49.282
that I would prostitute myself
for a role?

29:49.402 --> 29:51.061
No. Of course not.

29:51.181 --> 29:52.798
You--I--he's an idiot.

29:52.918 --> 29:55.262
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

29:55.382 --> 29:57.370
to be a woman in Hollywood?

30:01.145 --> 30:02.217
Ellie.

30:02.886 --> 30:03.692
I--

30:10.129 --> 30:11.598
Beckett.

30:13.909 --> 30:15.042
Oh, yeah.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.229
He looks like
a Zach Robinson.

30:17.684 --> 30:18.472
Where'd you find him?

30:19.667 --> 30:20.750
The boys
caught up with him

30:20.870 --> 30:22.388
at a craps table
at Mohegan Sun.

30:22.734 --> 30:25.420
Already gambling away his
hard-earned blackmail money?

30:26.006 --> 30:27.361
So how was your date
with your little starlet?

30:27.657 --> 30:28.877
How can you tell
this time?

30:29.219 --> 30:32.263
Like I said, Castle...
trained Detective.

30:32.383 --> 30:33.285
Well...

30:34.456 --> 30:35.695
It went lovely

30:35.815 --> 30:36.964
no thanks to you.

30:37.084 --> 30:38.200
What did I have to do
with it?

30:38.320 --> 30:39.638
You pulled your
Jedi mind trick on me.

30:39.967 --> 30:41.137
You made me doubt
Ellie's honesty.

30:41.257 --> 30:44.477
Foolishly, I told her
what you said, made her cry.

30:45.253 --> 30:47.113
Castle...
She's an actress,

30:47.890 --> 30:49.448
a professional liar.

30:49.568 --> 30:51.111
She's paid to cry on cue.

30:56.263 --> 30:58.097
No.

30:58.098 --> 30:59.564
I've never seen
this picture before.

30:59.959 --> 31:00.858
Really?

31:01.191 --> 31:03.557
You sure you didn't use it
to blackmail Bobby Mann?

31:03.896 --> 31:04.722
Blackmail?

31:05.350 --> 31:07.050
You're fishing
in the wrong pond, Detective.

31:07.888 --> 31:09.709
What about the 100 grand

31:09.829 --> 31:11.409
from Bobby Mann
in your bank account?

31:11.816 --> 31:13.060
Am I in the right pond now?

31:14.514 --> 31:17.530
That was for...
services rendered.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.197
I don't think Webster's
defines "blackmailing"

31:20.797 --> 31:21.696
as a service.

31:22.286 --> 31:25.451
More like a coercive threat,
Mr. Rob-inson.

31:25.571 --> 31:27.816
No, no. No, no.
I never threatened Bobby.

31:28.402 --> 31:29.375
He hired me.

31:29.495 --> 31:30.336
To do what?

31:34.981 --> 31:37.347
My guys say that
you don't have an alibi

31:37.467 --> 31:39.019
for the night that Mann
was murdered.

31:39.539 --> 31:40.841
You can't be serious.

31:40.961 --> 31:43.287
I guess it'll come out when
we go to the murder trial.

31:44.039 --> 31:45.653
Have a nice life...
sentence.

31:45.986 --> 31:47.969
What? No, no. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:48.089 --> 31:51.972
Look, he reached out to me.
Said he needed some work done.

31:52.568 --> 31:53.529
What kind of work?

31:53.954 --> 31:56.640
The kind that you get paid
a lot extra to do.

31:56.760 --> 31:57.736
Something illegal.

31:59.220 --> 32:00.181
W-well...

32:01.978 --> 32:04.035
Okay, look, he thought that
somebody was out to get him.

32:04.155 --> 32:05.168
He said he needed to know,

32:05.181 --> 32:08.289
and so he paid me
to bug a guy's office.

32:08.855 --> 32:09.681
Who?

32:10.757 --> 32:11.841
Howard Weisberg.

32:11.961 --> 32:13.011
The president
of the network?

32:13.131 --> 32:15.419
Easy gig, too. Bobby got me
into the building.

32:16.931 --> 32:17.831
When was this?

32:18.137 --> 32:18.851
Week ago.

32:19.073 --> 32:20.059
What did you do
with the recordings?

32:20.179 --> 32:22.042
I delivered the cds to Bobby.
When?

32:24.486 --> 32:25.324
You know...

32:26.080 --> 32:27.392
The morning
before he died.

32:28.549 --> 32:29.399
Bobby's producer said

32:29.519 --> 32:31.617
he locked himself
in his office that morning.

32:31.737 --> 32:33.119
He was listening
to the recordings.

32:33.239 --> 32:35.508
And then they said he
started acting paranoid after that,

32:35.628 --> 32:36.851
so what did he hear?

32:38.686 --> 32:39.955
Am I good to go?

32:45.719 --> 32:47.309
We found the recordings
in Mann's office

32:47.567 --> 32:49.035
mixed in with
his DVD collection.

32:49.155 --> 32:50.267
Heard anything yet
that would explain

32:50.387 --> 32:51.951
why Mann was listening in
on his boss?

32:52.071 --> 32:53.991
Nah, just a bunch of talk
about setting up breakfasts,

32:54.111 --> 32:56.836
lunches, dinners and drinks with
writers, actors and directors.

32:56.956 --> 32:57.723
Where are we
on the blackmail?

32:57.944 --> 32:59.953
Oh, we got uniforms
running down all show employees

33:00.073 --> 33:01.925
who could've had access to
the studio to take that photo.

33:02.045 --> 33:04.401
Yo. You guys
are gonna want to hear this.

33:06.149 --> 33:07.394
<i>you know what?</i>
<i>To hell with Bobby Mann.</i>

33:07.514 --> 33:09.513
<i>We're losing money on him</i>
<i>every damn night.</i>

33:09.633 --> 33:11.127
<i>I want him out!</i>
<i>our hands our tied.</i>

33:11.247 --> 33:12.051
<i>You can't fire him.</i>

33:12.470 --> 33:14.034
<i>He's got five years left</i>
<i>on his contract.</i>

33:14.154 --> 33:15.340
<i>What if he drops dead, huh?</i>

33:16.059 --> 33:17.636
<i>Seriously. The guy has got</i>
<i>a bad heart.</i>

33:18.166 --> 33:19.755
<i>How hard would it be</i>
<i>to make him go away?</i>

33:20.248 --> 33:22.047
<i>I mean, hell, I got Mickey reed</i>
<i>telling me every day,</i>

33:22.167 --> 33:23.366
<i>he's ready to step in</i>

33:23.486 --> 33:26.122
<i>If we could just get Bobby Mann</i>
<i>out</i> <i>the damn door.</i>

33:26.960 --> 33:28.824
Well, no wonder Bobby thought
Mickey was disloyal.

33:28.944 --> 33:30.956
And no wonder he thought
someone wanted him dead.

33:31.572 --> 33:32.359
Someone did.

33:33.577 --> 33:35.450
<i>What if he drops dead, huh?</i>

33:35.570 --> 33:37.076
<i>Seriously. The guy</i>
<i>has got a bad heart.</i>

33:37.717 --> 33:39.220
<i>How hard would it be</i>
<i>to make him go away?</i>

33:40.611 --> 33:42.089
Looks like you got your wish,
Mr. Weisberg.

33:43.341 --> 33:44.228
Detective,
none of the recordings

33:44.348 --> 33:45.288
are admissible in court.

33:45.300 --> 33:47.234
Oh, relax, Burt.
I didn't kill anyone, okay?

33:47.354 --> 33:48.599
Save it for when
I actually do.

33:48.719 --> 33:51.716
Detective, I wasn't serious.
Bobby thought you were.

33:51.836 --> 33:53.626
Well, then maybe he shouldn't
have been bugging my office.

33:53.746 --> 33:56.780
Hell, in private, I issue
a dozen death sentences a day

33:56.900 --> 33:59.874
on underperforming, overpaid
jackasses at my network.

33:59.994 --> 34:02.954
Now what I wanted was
Mickey Reed pulled to 11:30.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.668
But Bobby had an $80-million
penalty on his contract.

34:05.788 --> 34:08.043
Which still had another
five years left on it.

34:08.163 --> 34:11.862
Yeah. Now what I did was
lean on Bobby for a few months

34:11.982 --> 34:13.199
to appeal
to a younger audience.

34:13.319 --> 34:16.415
But the worst thing that I did
was threaten to fire him

34:16.534 --> 34:17.634
and pay him the $80 mil.

34:17.754 --> 34:21.702
Mr. Weisberg where were you
between 1:30 and 4:30 A.M.

34:21.822 --> 34:22.944
the night of the murder?

34:23.063 --> 34:25.161
You don't have to answer that.
It's fine, Burt. Chill out.

34:25.282 --> 34:27.215
I was at the Essex House Hotel.

34:27.335 --> 34:28.335
Were you with anyone?

34:28.456 --> 34:29.577
As a matter of fact I was.

34:30.465 --> 34:31.746
This actress I was screwing

34:31.866 --> 34:33.458
wanted a part
on one of my sitcoms.

34:33.579 --> 34:35.061
I met her after Bobby's show.

34:36.416 --> 34:37.487
I'm gonna need a name.

34:37.893 --> 34:39.989
Sure. Ellie Monroe.

34:46.830 --> 34:48.228
Thank you for coming by
Ms. Monroe.

34:48.475 --> 34:49.530
Of course.

34:51.000 --> 34:57.074

34:58.301 --> 34:59.714
Weisberg's alibi...

35:00.884 --> 35:01.796
Is good.

35:02.439 --> 35:03.859
Oh, go on.
You can say it.

35:04.541 --> 35:05.506
"I told you so."

35:05.984 --> 35:07.770
No, thanks. I'm actually
not in the gloating mood.

35:07.890 --> 35:10.456
His alibi sets us
back to square one...

35:11.287 --> 35:13.862
Which means we have no idea
who the blackmailer is

35:13.982 --> 35:16.313
And we don't know why Mann
went to the comedy club

35:16.433 --> 35:18.344
and trashed
Angel Santana's bike.

35:19.072 --> 35:20.316
And we have no idea
who the killer is.

35:20.994 --> 35:22.492
Well, the good news is,
I can work all night.

35:23.720 --> 35:24.769
No plans.

35:26.220 --> 35:28.068
You know, it's late,
and I'm kinda tired.

35:28.691 --> 35:29.861
How about we pick this up
in the morning?

35:30.612 --> 35:31.450
All righty, then.

35:31.570 --> 35:33.545
And the boys'll be
back on duty tomorrow,

35:34.050 --> 35:35.009
to coin a phrase...

35:36.899 --> 35:38.477
Which would be inaccurate...

35:39.625 --> 35:41.757
because you are not a boy.

35:43.348 --> 35:44.937
Is this some kind of
a weird come-on?

35:44.938 --> 35:47.217
I think I know what Bobby Mann
was doing at that comedy club.

35:47.337 --> 35:49.231
I think I know why he thought
he was an awful person.

35:49.351 --> 35:51.744
And... I think I know
who killed him.

35:51.864 --> 35:53.240
Mr. McPhee?

35:54.819 --> 35:55.558
Ah.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.001
I was just going over
my notes for the tribute.

35:59.473 --> 36:00.989
35 years of friendship--

36:01.550 --> 36:03.891
It's kinda hard to find
just the right story to tell.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.744
What can I do for you?

36:06.255 --> 36:07.487
We just came by
to give you this.

36:07.607 --> 36:09.126
Bobby's idea book--
we thought you might like it.

36:09.792 --> 36:13.760
Thanks.
We did have a question about
what he wrote on the last page.

36:14.663 --> 36:17.377
"the boys'll be back on duty
tomorrow night."

36:17.497 --> 36:18.658
Actually,
he crossed out "boys"

36:18.778 --> 36:20.799
and wrote "gang, posse"
and "crew."

36:21.914 --> 36:22.850
Any idea why?

36:24.928 --> 36:25.913
I guess we'll never know.

36:26.345 --> 36:27.651
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

36:27.771 --> 36:30.175
The network was pressuring
Bobby to make a change.

36:30.295 --> 36:32.109
They threatened to cancel him
unless he did.

36:32.229 --> 36:33.033
And the night
that he was murdered,

36:33.153 --> 36:36.048
he told Barbara that
something awful was going on.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.692
He asked her
if he was a good person.

36:38.812 --> 36:39.776
Why would he say that?

36:40.133 --> 36:41.624
Because of Kayla.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.109
Not Kayla, Hank.

36:45.229 --> 36:46.132
Because of you.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.522
He knew
that he had to fire you.

36:48.642 --> 36:50.877
He knew he needed to find
someone younger and hipper

36:50.997 --> 36:52.060
if he was gonna survive.

36:52.664 --> 36:54.068
Someone like Angel Santana.

36:54.352 --> 36:56.434
Weisberg confirmed that she was
on the network's short list.

36:56.554 --> 36:58.127
That's why it wasn't "boys"
anymore, Hank.

36:59.199 --> 37:00.275
'cause Angel's a girl.

37:00.670 --> 37:03.158
This is ridiculous.
Bobby would never fire me.

37:03.405 --> 37:05.388
Then why did you kill him?
I didn't.

37:05.809 --> 37:07.103
We ran your credit cards,
Hank.

37:07.780 --> 37:09.702
The night that he was murdered,
you went

37:09.822 --> 37:11.994
to a 24-hour grocery store
and bought two things--

37:12.114 --> 37:14.000
Cranberry juice
and balsamic vinegar.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.736
It's time stamped.
1:56 A.M.

37:17.185 --> 37:18.717
And I'm betting
if we test your keys,

37:18.837 --> 37:20.799
we'll find metal from
Angel Santana's motorcycle

37:20.919 --> 37:22.635
where you scratched in
"late-night bitch."

37:30.363 --> 37:31.599
He told me...

37:31.600 --> 37:33.477
that night just before
he left the studio...

37:36.657 --> 37:38.443
how he'd heard Weisberg say

37:38.563 --> 37:40.525
they were gonna bury him
unless he made a change.

37:42.698 --> 37:44.595
35 years, I had his back.

37:44.715 --> 37:46.470
He was gonna toss me aside
like one of his ex-wives,

37:47.100 --> 37:48.726
humiliate me in front of
the whole country.

37:50.236 --> 37:52.901
I knew it was coming.
I saw all the little signs,

37:53.201 --> 37:55.038
the awkward moments
in the hall.

37:55.716 --> 37:57.946
I sent him that picture
of him and Kayla

37:58.066 --> 38:00.015
to remind him
of all the secrets I kept.

38:01.081 --> 38:02.153
You know what he said?

38:02.896 --> 38:05.039
The scandal would only
help his ratings.

38:05.260 --> 38:06.763
You bought your poison

38:07.046 --> 38:08.660
and you followed him
to the club.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.865
I confronted him
when he came out.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.587
I told him not to throw away
everything we'd built.

38:14.085 --> 38:15.576
He told me
he couldn't save me.

38:15.822 --> 38:18.385
Weisberg was going younger
with or without him.

38:18.899 --> 38:21.154
Well, if you knew he didn't have
a choice, why did you kill him?

38:21.573 --> 38:23.224
Because he did have
another choice.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.470
Go down with the ship!

38:25.778 --> 38:27.539
We both go out gracefully,

38:27.858 --> 38:30.100
and Bobby
gets 80 million bucks

38:30.810 --> 38:33.151
instead of him continuing
the show with some kid.

38:35.830 --> 38:38.333
I gave him
over 4,000 shows,

38:38.966 --> 38:41.080
laughing at every lousy joke
he cracked,

38:41.200 --> 38:42.970
whether they were funny
or not.

38:44.669 --> 38:46.603
Jeez.

38:46.604 --> 38:48.268
So how did you manage it?

38:51.270 --> 38:53.042
When I knew
I couldn't change his mind,

38:53.043 --> 38:54.710
I told him...

38:54.711 --> 38:56.511
I understood.

38:56.512 --> 38:58.303
We walked over
to the West Side highway,

38:59.281 --> 39:01.942
sat on a bench,
looked out at the water,

39:02.689 --> 39:04.993
talked about
what a great run we'd had.

39:07.854 --> 39:09.331
Then I offered him a drink.

39:11.255 --> 39:12.721
He was my best friend.

39:14.361 --> 39:15.778
You don't do that
to your friend.

39:20.052 --> 39:21.481
Yet another example of

39:21.601 --> 39:23.637
why you shouldn't mix
business with pleasure,

39:24.205 --> 39:25.436
even show business.

39:25.556 --> 39:27.494
Are you talking about the case
or yourself?

39:28.011 --> 39:29.909
Yeah.

39:29.910 --> 39:31.410
Touché, Detective.

39:31.411 --> 39:32.858
So you want to go
for a victory lap

39:32.978 --> 39:33.737
and grab a burger?

39:33.958 --> 39:36.188
Oh, can't. Gotta go.
Big date.

39:36.533 --> 39:37.322
You're kidding, right?

39:37.442 --> 39:39.055
You're going out with
Ellie Monroe even though

39:39.175 --> 39:41.494
you know the only reason
that she was interested in you

39:41.614 --> 39:42.678
was for a part?

39:42.798 --> 39:45.618
Have you lost
all sense of human decency

39:45.738 --> 39:47.897
and self-res--what?

39:48.871 --> 39:51.480
My big date...
is with Alexis.

39:52.064 --> 39:53.587
She's getting back
from her trip.

39:55.657 --> 39:56.322
Oh.

40:04.576 --> 40:09.146
♪

40:13.951 --> 40:15.805
Right on time, Alexis.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.658
Oh, Sacagawea...

40:18.778 --> 40:19.975
has returned!

40:21.138 --> 40:23.327
And you are not
Sacagawea,

40:23.447 --> 40:24.978
but come in.

40:25.098 --> 40:26.037
Thanks.

40:28.462 --> 40:29.484
I'm headed back to L.A.

40:29.604 --> 40:32.650
and I just wanted to...
say sorry.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.982
Thanks.
But the truth is,

40:36.102 --> 40:38.165
I've never had so much fun
being used.

40:38.285 --> 40:40.148
You feel free
to have at me anytime.

40:40.268 --> 40:42.851
Well, I guess you'll rescind
your recommendation of me

40:42.971 --> 40:44.715
to your producers, and that
is the least I deserve--

40:44.835 --> 40:46.858
No, Tony thinks you are
great for it, and so do I.

40:47.191 --> 40:49.082
You are a better actress
than I thought

40:49.083 --> 40:50.169
when I recommended you.

40:50.587 --> 40:52.490
Well, you should know, I wasn't
acting the whole time.

40:52.610 --> 40:54.744
Me neither.

40:55.722 --> 40:56.744
Thanks, Rick.

40:57.985 --> 40:58.993
Take care.

40:59.444 --> 41:00.294
You, too.

41:00.414 --> 41:01.414
Bye.

41:02.095 --> 41:03.175
Hi.

41:03.749 --> 41:04.525
Dad, was that--

41:04.645 --> 41:06.304
My Sacagawea
has returned!

41:06.424 --> 41:08.620
Oh, my God. My best girl.
I missed you so much.

41:08.999 --> 41:10.313
Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you're home.

41:10.433 --> 41:11.792
I missed you, too, dad.

41:13.826 --> 41:15.058
You're not just saying that,
are you?

41:15.178 --> 41:16.249
What--
No, don't.

41:17.252 --> 41:18.700
Tell me you're hungry.
I'm starving.

41:18.701 --> 41:20.968
Come with me.
Tell me everything.
I will.
