00:39.472 --> 00:41.707
- Sequence I-5 completed.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.576
Now commencing batch assembly.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.746
- Iranian media has dubbed
it the Horror of Hamadan.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.314
The first of its kind.

00:49.315 --> 00:53.786
Droid infantry units deployed
in Iran were used in warfare.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.422
The Mexican government is
imploring the US for aid,

00:56.423 --> 00:59.358
as it is ill-prepared to face
cartel brutality in Juarez.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.660
- The agency has a policy
that is actually putting

01:01.661 --> 01:04.663
robotic weapons into
the cartel's hands.

01:04.664 --> 01:08.267
- You are intentionally letting
the weapons go to Mexico?

01:08.268 --> 01:09.869
- Yes, ma'am.

01:19.979 --> 01:22.047
- Speculation rises
as rumors unfold

01:22.048 --> 01:24.750
of Gearside International's
involvement in Juarez.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.186
Specifically, they
entail the illicit sale

01:27.187 --> 01:30.222
of military-grade droids
on the black market.

01:30.223 --> 01:31.490
- Mr. Fox?

01:31.491 --> 01:34.026
Did you sell your
droids to the cartel?

01:34.027 --> 01:36.328
Is Gearside responsible
for the bloodshed?

01:36.329 --> 01:42.968
- Xavier Unit 62894.

01:42.969 --> 01:44.504
Completed.

02:56.576 --> 02:57.576
- Okay.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.045
Ah.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.447
You got a smoke?

03:02.448 --> 03:04.082
- Shut up and sit still.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.751
- All right, how
about some caffeine?

03:05.752 --> 03:07.720
'Cause I got a headache
like you wouldn't believe.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.157
Okay.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.624
How about some morphine?

03:12.625 --> 03:14.705
But not a lot, you know,
just enough to kill a horse,

03:14.729 --> 03:15.729
or two.

03:21.301 --> 03:25.037
- Shut up, sit still,
and close your mouth.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.173
- Isn't this an
unfortunate sight?

03:28.174 --> 03:31.177
This is no place
for a true Marine.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.045
- How about your sister?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.713
See, I've read
somewhere that orgasms

03:34.714 --> 03:37.584
are amazing for migraines.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.157
Yeah, that wasn't a good idea.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.860
I'm not up for review, so
what the hell is this?

03:48.861 --> 03:49.796
Movie night?

03:49.797 --> 03:51.496
- Gunny, recover yourself.

03:51.497 --> 03:52.732
You're dismissed.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.103
You're right.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.540
Reviews, non-existent.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.176
No more retrials.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.411
You'll keep rotting
like you've been.

04:06.412 --> 04:10.148
Buried deep down in
nothing but darkness.

04:10.149 --> 04:12.651
It's sad, but
you're what we call

04:12.652 --> 04:16.688
a casualty of circumstance,
an acceptable loss.

04:16.689 --> 04:19.190
- Hm, is that what it's called?

04:19.192 --> 04:21.627
And all this time, I thought
I'd just been fucked over.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.061
- It is what it is.

04:23.062 --> 04:25.631
The world needed a villain,

04:25.632 --> 04:27.966
and you just happened to oblige.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.035
- Okay.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.104
What do you want, general?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.940
- Look, I'm not here to
bullshit with you, son.

04:34.941 --> 04:38.143
Nor reminisce over
failed missions.

04:38.144 --> 04:42.547
I'm here to extend you an
opportunity, to make things right.

04:42.548 --> 04:43.548
By us...

04:46.019 --> 04:47.120
And by them.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.825
It's not too late.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.794
One last mission.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.299
No more darkness, you
get your life back.

05:06.072 --> 05:09.509
You can't give a dead
man his life back.

05:11.778 --> 05:12.778
I'll pass.

05:14.947 --> 05:18.050
They're better off without me.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.484
- It's a simple job.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.752
In and out.

05:20.753 --> 05:24.757
Retrieve the asset, and
go home to your family.

05:26.125 --> 05:29.061
- If it's so simple, then
why does it have to be me?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.896
- Seven years ago,

05:30.897 --> 05:34.166
Project Chariot was supposed
to save lives in combat.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.500
But it didn't.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.935
You were there.

05:36.936 --> 05:38.470
So was this man.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.839
Estevan Flores, lead
engineer and scientist

05:40.840 --> 05:42.441
on the Chariot Project.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.042
He's resurfaced.

05:44.043 --> 05:49.014
And intel reveals that he's
been working for Gearside.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.248
- Gearside?

05:50.249 --> 05:52.718
- Flores' landing
spot after Chariot.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.287
Medical, commercial, and
weaponized robotics,

05:55.288 --> 05:57.389
the latter of which
is now defunct.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.658
No more droids in warfare.

05:59.659 --> 06:03.462
New Persian AT treaty,
ratified by all countries.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.530
- So Estevan is the asset?

06:05.531 --> 06:07.532
- Affirmative.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.067
- That's fine, but I,

06:09.068 --> 06:11.403
I still don't see why
it has to be me.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.538
- Droids like this one
have been terrorizing

06:13.539 --> 06:17.509
the Mexican city of Juarez
for a little over a month.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.278
We're not sure how, but
intel leads us to believe

06:20.279 --> 06:22.514
that Gearside has a hand in it,

06:22.515 --> 06:26.785
but the Malvado Cartel has
over a dozen of these droids.

06:26.786 --> 06:30.622
And they've been paintin'
the city in blood.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.791
This is the hardware
in your head.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.226
The malfunction was severe,

06:34.227 --> 06:36.461
makin' it too
dangerous to remove.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.296
The chip was designed
to remotely manipulate

06:38.297 --> 06:40.332
all droid activity.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.400
You know how it works.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.401
- Yeah.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.269
Except it doesn't.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.038
- It's gotta be you.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.575
Flores can repair the chip.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.906
- Don't get so angry.

07:20.907 --> 07:23.141
Enjoy the tequila.

07:23.142 --> 07:25.377
My father promised you droids.

07:25.378 --> 07:29.549
He's not a man that stupid
to break his promises.

07:30.349 --> 07:31.349
- Patience?

07:34.387 --> 07:35.655
Fuck patience!

07:36.722 --> 07:40.660
There are lots of pigs
waiting to be skinned.

07:46.599 --> 07:50.669
- These droids are one of
a kind killing machines.

07:50.670 --> 07:54.307
You'll be very pleased
when they arrive.

07:56.542 --> 08:00.613
- Because if you guys don't
keep your promise...

08:14.293 --> 08:17.230
Now that's what I'm
talking about!

08:19.565 --> 08:21.667
- Just like we promised.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.873
- Nothing, nothing's
gonna stop us now!

08:27.807 --> 08:29.375
- Al Malvado!

08:33.379 --> 08:35.313
- Al Malvado!

09:48.588 --> 09:50.022
- Que?

09:51.390 --> 09:53.091
- What's with the
skeleton saint?

09:53.092 --> 09:55.027
- La Nina Blanca?

09:56.796 --> 09:58.331
She keep me safe.

10:00.032 --> 10:03.636
You know, before, I
live in Florida, yeah?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.771
Get deported.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.108
It was beautiful there.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.145
But every month,
something bad happen.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.881
But here, in Juarez...

10:17.149 --> 10:19.819
something bad happen every day.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.725
- Where are we going?

10:26.726 --> 10:28.394
- That's why I have my santo.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.336
- Americano!

11:11.337 --> 11:13.838
Are you still alive?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.875
Welcome to Juarez.

11:25.551 --> 11:26.552
- Oh, fuck.

11:27.586 --> 11:28.586
Not now...

11:32.224 --> 11:36.895
- Fuck, man, this is
just what we need!

11:36.896 --> 11:38.430
- Fuck, how did they know
where we were gonna be?

11:38.431 --> 11:40.498
- These droids are gonna tear
us apart if we don't move now!

11:40.499 --> 11:42.200
- How are we supposed
to do that, Sergeant?

11:42.201 --> 11:44.502
Fuckin' Mr. Miyagi got us
pinned down by the end zone!

11:44.503 --> 11:45.770
- I would have gotten a valet,

11:45.771 --> 11:47.051
but I don't trust
these Mexicans.

11:47.506 --> 11:48.773
- Let me deal with that.

11:48.774 --> 11:51.743
You just keep blastin'
away at these fucks!

11:51.744 --> 11:53.584
A.D.A.M., A.D.A.M., the
pick-up's gone to shit!

11:53.608 --> 11:55.109
We need immediate evac!

12:00.252 --> 12:01.754
- Go and kill them!

12:08.861 --> 12:09.894
- How's things, Wright?

12:09.895 --> 12:10.796
- Fantastic.

12:10.797 --> 12:11.863
- Oh, good.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.024
We'll have to catch up later.

12:13.048 --> 12:14.165
- Yep.
- Yeah?

12:14.166 --> 12:15.067
Get your gear ready.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.267
We're Oscar Mike.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.036
- Not with that nickel
fucker out there.

12:18.037 --> 12:19.837
- These bastards aren't
the kind you remember.

12:19.861 --> 12:22.107
Takes a heavy shot to even
scratch one of these bitches.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.341
- We need a new fuckin' plan,

12:23.342 --> 12:24.822
this bitch ain't got
time for bullets.

12:24.846 --> 12:27.245
- Somebody hit him
with a flash bang!

12:27.246 --> 12:29.086
- That could work, that
could buy us some time.

12:29.110 --> 12:30.644
Go for it!

12:31.383 --> 12:32.418
Bombs away!

12:41.427 --> 12:43.228
- That shit actually works?

12:43.229 --> 12:44.463
- Yeah, looks like it.

12:46.752 --> 12:48.032
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck, we don't have

12:48.033 --> 12:49.473
the power to stop
these things, boys.

12:49.474 --> 12:51.309
We gotta make a run for
it, it's now or never.

12:51.310 --> 12:54.607
- Yeah, this is some real
taxi service, fellas.

13:10.724 --> 13:11.724
- Come on you fucks!

13:11.725 --> 13:13.292
What do you want, an invitation?

13:24.470 --> 13:25.970
- What the fuck's it doin'?

13:25.971 --> 13:27.931
- Don't ask why, just get
your asses to the truck!

13:38.083 --> 13:39.751
- Americanos!

13:39.752 --> 13:42.221
I see you all, real soon!

13:52.064 --> 13:53.531
- Is he alive?

13:53.532 --> 13:54.866
- Huh.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.401
Don't know.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.503
My men have happy
trigger fingers.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.572
Could be yes, could be no.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.941
- No is not an option.

14:02.942 --> 14:05.978
You must capture
the soldier alive.

14:06.980 --> 14:07.980
- Why?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.314
What's changed?

14:09.315 --> 14:12.550
Yesterday, he was just a
Marine you wanted dead.

14:12.551 --> 14:13.818
- Yes.

14:13.819 --> 14:16.688
Before, we were unaware
of his real importance.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.690
- And that would be?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.091
- You've been rather
too inquisitive

14:20.115 --> 14:23.194
for a man that has
yet to deliver.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.631
We are very disillusioned,
Senor Malvado.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.032
It's been well over a month,

14:28.033 --> 14:30.768
and you have yet to actualize
what you promised.

14:30.769 --> 14:33.605
- Making droids is
tricky business.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.839
- I don't need to remind you

14:34.840 --> 14:38.977
of the parameters of our
partnership, correct?

14:38.978 --> 14:41.145
So forget about why we
need the Marine alive,

14:41.146 --> 14:43.948
and simply fulfill
the task as such.

14:43.949 --> 14:46.317
Our man will be in touch.

14:46.318 --> 14:47.853
- Jefe?

14:55.027 --> 14:56.294
- Alive.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.063
Why did you stop me?

14:59.531 --> 15:01.466
- Change of plans.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.700
- Why?

15:02.701 --> 15:05.337
I can take care of
those bastards.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.477
- Do you know why I sent you?

15:12.478 --> 15:14.580
- I'm your best soldier.

15:15.714 --> 15:16.948
- No.

15:16.949 --> 15:20.486
Because you are weak, and
I need you stronger.

15:24.189 --> 15:26.625
I sent you to kill that man.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.828
But now, I want him alive.

15:36.468 --> 15:39.070
I rotted on Las Islas Marias.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.439
Just a boy.

15:45.844 --> 15:49.949
Bled out, the first day...

15:56.355 --> 15:58.023
I should have died...

16:00.526 --> 16:03.762
squealing and choking
on my own blood.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.276
Saved me.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.181
Pulled me away from death.

16:30.589 --> 16:34.626
Gave me hope that if I kill
and keep on killing...

16:45.437 --> 16:48.773
she would shine
her shadow on me,

16:48.774 --> 16:51.377
and I would keep on surviving.

17:00.152 --> 17:03.454
There is no room for
weakness in my family.

17:03.455 --> 17:06.089
- I have your blood running
through my veins, Jefe.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.291
I'm not weak.

17:10.029 --> 17:14.532
- Bring the Americano, alive.

17:50.702 --> 17:51.969
- No, this seemed calculated.

17:51.970 --> 17:54.639
They knew where the
pickup was gonna be.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.680
- Yeah, man, if A.D.A.M.
hadn't detected that droid,

17:56.704 --> 17:57.909
we'd have been fucked.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.077
- A.D.A.M.?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.079
- Yeah, he's uh, he's
our big brother.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.447
He's always fuckin' watching.

18:02.448 --> 18:03.981
- Fuck that shit.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.216
Why'd they stop?

18:05.217 --> 18:06.317
It makes no sense to
just ambush a brother

18:06.318 --> 18:07.518
and leave us alive.

18:07.519 --> 18:08.799
- Yeah, that droid
was real close

18:08.823 --> 18:11.155
to sending us all
home in body bags.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.424
- I've never seen a droid
take so much punishment.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.059
- Where the fuck
you been, prison?

18:15.060 --> 18:17.462
Yo, this is Juarez 2045, man.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.130
Technology's a motherfucker.

18:19.131 --> 18:20.898
- We'll figure it out later.

18:20.899 --> 18:21.899
Fall in.

18:41.253 --> 18:45.022
Well then, this here is
Senor Carson Wright,

18:45.023 --> 18:47.125
formally of the United
States Marine Corps.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.360
He was on the block, but
now he's back in action.

18:49.361 --> 18:51.362
And don't ask why.

18:51.363 --> 18:52.363
- Boys.

18:53.665 --> 18:56.067
- Of course, you know you know
CSO Sergeant Mickey Stauskas.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.270
These two gagglefucks are
Corporals Stewart Hinkley

18:59.271 --> 19:00.304
and Chris Stratton.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.539
- Yo.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.775
- Then there's the
scrawny piece of...

19:04.776 --> 19:06.778
Where the fuck is Luke?

19:08.580 --> 19:10.414
- Probably skinnin' it.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.175
- A.D.A.M., where the
hell is your boyfriend?

19:12.199 --> 19:13.518
- Sir, Corporal
Hemsworth will be

19:13.519 --> 19:16.654
within your immediate
vicinity, forthwith.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.089
- Sorry.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.925
Sir, I was trying...
- Shut the fuck up, Luke.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.727
This embarrassment is
Special Tech Ops Chief,

19:22.728 --> 19:25.029
Corporal Luke Hemsworth.

19:25.030 --> 19:28.699
Best tech in the field,
big pain in my ass.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.268
- Sup?

19:30.269 --> 19:31.103
- That it?

19:31.104 --> 19:32.236
'Kay, good, now...

19:32.237 --> 19:34.205
- You forgot to introduce
yourself, sir.

19:34.206 --> 19:37.475
- That's because me and
Wright go way back.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.243
Ain't that right?

19:39.244 --> 19:40.244
- Sure do.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.881
- All right then,
we know two things.

19:43.882 --> 19:45.917
One, Estevan Flores
is being held captive

19:45.918 --> 19:48.252
by the Malvado Cartel.

19:48.253 --> 19:51.389
Two, this is an unsanctioned
black ops detail.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.823
There'll be no
songs sang for us.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.184
- Do we know where
he's being kept?

19:54.208 --> 19:55.259
- Nah.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.361
Four days of recon
just fuckin' wasted.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.397
The city's too big.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.665
- That's right.

20:00.666 --> 20:02.226
But recently, I got a
tip on a nightclub

20:02.250 --> 20:04.135
operated by these bastards.

20:04.136 --> 20:04.970
- Nightclub?

20:04.970 --> 20:05.970
We talkin' titties?

20:06.772 --> 20:08.105
- Luke?

20:08.106 --> 20:11.143
- A.D.A.M., pull
up the schematics.

20:11.910 --> 20:12.944
- Simple in and out.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.313
The building isn't complex.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.281
Objective, Miguel Alarcon.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.451
Big shot Malvado captain.

20:20.485 --> 20:21.485
A.D.A.M.?

20:22.654 --> 20:24.155
He operates the nightclub.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.957
We get in, and get
this fucker to tell us

20:25.958 --> 20:27.925
where they're holding Flores.

20:27.926 --> 20:29.126
- Sounds like a mission.

20:29.127 --> 20:30.127
- I'm ready.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.430
- Not ready to get
your gear packed,

20:32.431 --> 20:33.497
'cause your dumb ass
is stayin' here.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.032
- Isn't that right, team leader?

20:35.033 --> 20:36.001
- We'll see.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.069
We're not a go until tonight.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.670
- Damn right we'll see.

20:39.671 --> 20:40.838
Can I get an ooh rah?

20:40.839 --> 20:42.707
Yeah...

20:42.708 --> 20:44.041
You ain't goin'.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.911
- Ooh rah, Corporal Hemsworth.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.145
- Thanks, A.D.A.M..

20:48.146 --> 20:49.146
Yeah.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.517
- Who's A.D.A.M.?

21:09.668 --> 21:11.436
- Did you finish it?

21:12.371 --> 21:14.573
- Yes, I have it with me.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.607
It took me the entire week but

21:16.608 --> 21:19.611
it's finished.

22:14.533 --> 22:15.833
- Careful now.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.501
The slightest error...
- Trust me!

22:17.502 --> 22:19.438
I know what I'm doing!

22:27.112 --> 22:30.115
- Help him, he's
been electrocuted!

22:31.550 --> 22:33.017
- What's going on?

22:33.018 --> 22:35.219
- He's going into
cardiac arrest!

22:35.220 --> 22:36.620
Help him, please!

22:36.621 --> 22:37.621
Come on!

22:50.869 --> 22:51.902
- Now!

22:51.903 --> 22:55.574
Oof!

22:56.475 --> 22:59.311
- No!

23:18.898 --> 23:19.898
- You!

23:19.898 --> 23:20.898
Stand up!

23:26.171 --> 23:27.171
Sit there!

23:31.743 --> 23:32.743
Sit!

23:35.380 --> 23:36.380
How long?

23:37.215 --> 23:38.949
- I-I don't know.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.551
I don't know!

23:40.552 --> 23:43.521
M-maybe a week, I don't...

23:43.522 --> 23:44.955
- Jefe...

23:44.956 --> 23:46.892
Jefe, I'm sorry.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.195
- A week?

23:52.764 --> 23:54.932
I already gave you a month!

23:54.933 --> 23:56.300
- I told you...

23:56.301 --> 23:59.471
I told you, this is
not my specialty!

24:01.339 --> 24:04.074
- So you can't finish it?

24:04.075 --> 24:05.643
- No, I can finish.

24:05.644 --> 24:06.478
I can finish!

24:06.479 --> 24:07.978
I...

24:07.979 --> 24:10.649
I cannot concentrate like this!

24:12.451 --> 24:16.320
Please, my daughter,
may I please see her?

24:16.321 --> 24:17.755
I have done...

24:17.756 --> 24:22.126
I have done everything
asked, everything, for you.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.894
I-I told you what
they were planning...

24:23.895 --> 24:24.729
- What?

24:24.730 --> 24:26.096
You fucking bastard!

24:26.097 --> 24:28.299
- It was not supposed
to be like this.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.336
I was, I was sent
here to help you!

24:32.370 --> 24:34.473
- Men are most motivated

24:35.540 --> 24:38.309
when you threaten
the ones they love.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.413
And I don't care
what deal was made.

24:43.248 --> 24:44.416
Deals change.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.052
Daughters die.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.089
I don't give a fuck.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.657
Finish...

24:54.893 --> 24:56.460
my weapon...

24:56.461 --> 25:00.664
or I will bring her back to you.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.665
- No...

25:19.551 --> 25:21.820
- This is A.D.A.M..

25:27.359 --> 25:28.559
- A contact lens?

25:28.560 --> 25:29.994
- No, it's not just
a contact lens,

25:29.995 --> 25:31.395
it's a state of the art HUD,

25:31.396 --> 25:33.931
using the latest version
of the A.D.A.M.

25:33.932 --> 25:35.172
The most sophisticated piece of

25:35.196 --> 25:36.901
artificial intelligence
technology.

25:36.902 --> 25:38.270
- It's a droid.

25:40.773 --> 25:41.773
No thanks.

25:41.773 --> 25:42.707
- No.

25:42.708 --> 25:43.908
No, A.D.A.M. is not a droid.

25:43.909 --> 25:46.143
- Oh.
- He doesn't have a body.

25:46.144 --> 25:47.811
He's more like a brain.

25:47.812 --> 25:51.115
Fully automated, tactical
information system.

25:51.116 --> 25:52.716
He's like a fish that
can swim in and out

25:52.717 --> 25:53.984
of any network anytime...
- Listen to me, it's a bot.

25:53.985 --> 25:56.420
I don't want anything to
do with it, understand?

25:56.421 --> 25:58.556
Give it to somebody else.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.391
- Wait.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.758
Dude, wait.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.293
I can't.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.062
They're all pussies.

26:05.931 --> 26:07.532
Plus, I hate them.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.067
Come on, man.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.136
Just think of it like
another operator,

26:12.137 --> 26:14.172
a voice over the phone.

26:15.774 --> 26:18.842
Plus, he'll give you a major
tactical advantage in combat.

26:18.843 --> 26:20.323
Something I'm sure
somebody who's been

26:20.347 --> 26:23.884
out of the game a while
could probably use.

26:29.054 --> 26:30.054
- Fine.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.849
But don't expect me to
get friendly with him.

26:32.873 --> 26:33.991
You understand?

26:33.992 --> 26:35.160
- Yeah, yeah.

26:36.494 --> 26:38.495
Don't forget to put
the ear piece in.

26:38.496 --> 26:41.198
Everything will start
working after that.

26:41.199 --> 26:43.201
A.D.A.M. will help you.

26:44.069 --> 26:45.503
- Sweet Jesus...

26:58.984 --> 27:00.584
- How is it?

27:00.585 --> 27:01.987
Kick ass, right?

27:02.921 --> 27:05.256
- Hello, Carson.

27:06.157 --> 27:08.093
- Say hi, dude.

27:10.862 --> 27:11.862
- Hi.

27:13.531 --> 27:14.932
- We all have earpieces that can

27:14.933 --> 27:17.001
relay and receive
information from A.D.A.M..

27:17.002 --> 27:20.804
But you're the only one
with the contact lens.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.339
- Corporal, Sergeant Hernandez

27:22.340 --> 27:24.108
requests your presence.

27:24.109 --> 27:25.109
- All right.

27:25.110 --> 27:27.044
I gotta go check in.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.514
Keep that in, and
get used to it.

27:30.515 --> 27:31.515
Oh, yeah.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.287
Welcome to the team, bro.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.167
- I hope it's fine that
I call you Carson,

27:50.168 --> 27:51.869
as there is no official
record of your rank

27:51.870 --> 27:53.538
within my database.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.673
- Oh.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.908
Where exactly are your
databases housed?

27:57.909 --> 27:59.443
- My physical systems are housed

27:59.444 --> 28:02.780
within the United States,
in a classified location.

28:02.781 --> 28:05.149
Sorry, Carson, you lack
the appropriate clearance

28:05.150 --> 28:07.651
to disclose anything further.

28:07.652 --> 28:08.586
- Yeah.

28:08.587 --> 28:11.121
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

28:11.122 --> 28:12.990
- However, to answer
your question

28:12.991 --> 28:17.461
more precisely, my database
is a collection of databases.

28:17.462 --> 28:19.797
An information cloud.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.298
- Closed networks?

28:21.299 --> 28:24.935
- Any network I am capable
of migrating to, any system.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.837
- So you're like a...

28:26.838 --> 28:28.472
Eye in the sky.

28:28.473 --> 28:30.241
- Indeed.

28:31.242 --> 28:35.012
- Listen to me, talkin'
to a computer.

28:35.013 --> 28:36.013
- I am much more advanced

28:36.014 --> 28:38.015
than a computer, Carson.

28:38.016 --> 28:41.885
I am A.D.A.M., artificial
data aid and management.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.620
- Hmm, thank you, A.D.A.M..

28:43.621 --> 28:45.490
Computer with an ego.

28:48.159 --> 28:49.860
- A.D.A.M., is Wright with you?

28:49.861 --> 28:51.295
We need him down here.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.331
- Copy that, on my way.

28:59.170 --> 29:02.740
- Chris and Stewart are on
recon at the nightclub.

29:02.741 --> 29:07.011
In the meantime, we received
another tip from the locals.

29:08.140 --> 29:09.780
Supposedly, an old man
is trying to unload

29:09.781 --> 29:10.981
a damaged droid.

29:10.982 --> 29:12.449
- What good's a damaged droid?

29:12.450 --> 29:15.319
- Luke thinks it
could be important.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.221
It's not far.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.189
Junkyard a few clicks from here.

29:19.190 --> 29:21.058
- Yeah, and if it's
one of the cartel's,

29:21.059 --> 29:23.099
maybe we could download the
information it processed

29:23.123 --> 29:25.028
before it was damaged.

29:25.029 --> 29:27.698
Could be GPS coordinates.

29:27.699 --> 29:31.201
I'm gonna get everything
ready for the download.

29:31.202 --> 29:32.303
- All right.

29:34.672 --> 29:38.542
Mickey, take Wright and
repossess that droid.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.144
- You got it.

29:40.145 --> 29:41.311
Come on.

29:41.312 --> 29:43.648
- Wright, give me a minute.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.458
What the fuck is it
with you, Wright?

29:54.459 --> 29:58.195
Trouble seems to follow
you everywhere you go.

29:58.196 --> 30:01.265
I don't care what the hell
you have in your head.

30:01.266 --> 30:02.633
You flip out again like Iran,

30:02.634 --> 30:06.571
and I will cut it from
your fuckin' shoulders.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.343
- Hey, Barney.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.680
It ain't gonna be like Iran.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.126
- General?

30:30.255 --> 30:31.495
- Did your team recover Wright?

30:31.496 --> 30:32.696
- Yes, sir.

30:32.697 --> 30:34.598
Though there was an
ambush waiting for him.

30:34.599 --> 30:35.632
- Cartel?

30:35.633 --> 30:36.867
- Yes sir.

30:36.868 --> 30:39.169
Somebody wanted to
welcome him to Juarez.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.170
- Not important.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.638
What about Flores?

30:41.639 --> 30:44.007
- We think we have a direct
line to his location,

30:44.008 --> 30:47.578
but we have to coax it out
of a certain Mexican first.

30:47.579 --> 30:48.879
- Find him quickly.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.113
The chip must be repaired.

30:50.114 --> 30:51.315
- Yes sir.

30:51.316 --> 30:53.250
- And Sergeant, when it's done,

30:53.251 --> 30:56.553
the only asset we
require is the chip.

30:56.554 --> 30:57.688
Understood?

30:57.689 --> 30:58.689
- Yes sir.

31:24.249 --> 31:25.683
- Let's do this.

31:54.345 --> 31:55.446
Let's go in.

32:00.018 --> 32:01.018
- Hola.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.290
- Um...

32:07.091 --> 32:08.526
Speak English?

32:09.727 --> 32:11.295
- A little bit, yes.

32:11.296 --> 32:12.529
- That's good, that's good.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.831
Uh, my friend and I here, we uh,

32:14.832 --> 32:17.902
we heard you have somethin'
very special for sale, huh?

32:20.004 --> 32:21.005
- And uh...

32:22.307 --> 32:24.541
Very expensive too.

32:24.542 --> 32:26.144
- Oh, that's good.

32:27.211 --> 32:29.947
Uh, you see, we're with
the United States uh,

32:29.948 --> 32:31.348
Americano, si?

32:31.349 --> 32:32.883
- Ah, si, si.

32:32.884 --> 32:36.119
- Si, and we've come here
to pick up the, the droid.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.355
- You uh, you want to buy?

32:38.356 --> 32:39.190
- Uh, well...

32:39.191 --> 32:40.524
- Uh, can we see it?

32:40.525 --> 32:41.793
- Ah, si, si.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.797
I give you gringos a good deal.

33:00.445 --> 33:01.713
- Yeah.

33:06.017 --> 33:07.618
Hmm, bullet holes.

33:09.153 --> 33:12.489
Looks like it's been
through some shit.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.091
This is how you found it?

33:14.092 --> 33:15.325
- Yes, yes, I uh,

33:15.326 --> 33:18.096
I find that uh, it's no working.

33:20.431 --> 33:22.511
- This droid looks different
from the ones I've seen.

33:22.535 --> 33:24.468
- Yeah, it's probably
a prototype.

33:24.469 --> 33:28.472
- Yeah, it looks like less
density in the armor.

33:28.473 --> 33:31.541
We better get 'er back to Luke.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.643
- So, do you want it?

33:33.644 --> 33:35.078
- We want it.

33:35.079 --> 33:36.513
But we don't have any money.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.049
- No, no, no, no, no.

33:42.954 --> 33:45.155
- Are you serious?

33:45.156 --> 33:48.292
That is way too much
for this, old man.

33:50.395 --> 33:51.662
- No, no, no, no, no.

33:52.997 --> 33:54.765
- Listen to me,
it's very important

33:54.766 --> 33:57.334
that we bring this droid
back, do you understand?

33:57.335 --> 33:58.635
- I don't care.

33:58.636 --> 34:00.571
Look at all that gold.

34:05.476 --> 34:06.844
No, no, no, no, no.

34:09.112 --> 34:10.793
- Look at this thing,
this is pure useless.

34:10.817 --> 34:12.748
You want to charge us $1,000?

34:12.750 --> 34:15.018
You gotta be fuckin'...

34:17.021 --> 34:18.355
Oh shit.

34:18.356 --> 34:20.357
That doesn't sound good.

34:20.358 --> 34:21.858
- It's probably just a rat.

34:21.859 --> 34:23.860
- Oh, rat, my ass.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.529
- Carson, an analysis
of the droid's

34:25.530 --> 34:28.331
vital systems suggests the
droid is still functional.

34:28.331 --> 34:30.233
I'd prepare to fire.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.701
- Activation.

34:31.702 --> 34:33.871
- You never took its
gun when you found it?

34:44.248 --> 34:45.248
Stay put.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.360
- Wright!

34:56.360 --> 34:58.162
It's got grenade rounds!

35:57.355 --> 35:58.589
- Die.

36:00.057 --> 36:01.592
- Wright!

36:03.594 --> 36:05.629
- Carson, the areas
highlighted in your HUD

36:05.630 --> 36:07.297
are microcontroller
wires that connect

36:07.298 --> 36:08.698
to the droid's
processing systems.

36:08.699 --> 36:11.836
Damaging them could
incapacitate it.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.137
Carson?

36:15.706 --> 36:19.143
Carson!

36:27.618 --> 36:28.618
Carson!

37:23.908 --> 37:24.908
- Enough!

37:25.743 --> 37:27.911
We need it in one piece.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.112
- Droid disabled.

37:29.113 --> 37:31.715
Damage percentage at 92%.

37:31.716 --> 37:35.987
7% more, and the droid will
be completely useless.

37:36.787 --> 37:38.388
- Hey, old man!

37:38.389 --> 37:40.258
You can come out now!

37:47.665 --> 37:51.102
- I've seen that emblem before.

37:52.703 --> 37:53.738
- Gearside.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.808
- Hey!

37:58.809 --> 38:02.113
So you're sure we can't
take it with us?

38:04.882 --> 38:06.650
- Just take it.

38:06.651 --> 38:07.651
Gratis.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.520
Gratis.

38:33.944 --> 38:35.313
- Rip off all her clothes!

38:36.914 --> 38:40.116
Show that little princessa how
she's supposed to please me.

38:40.117 --> 38:41.352
- No, no!

39:00.404 --> 39:03.574
- Show her how to make me happy.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.683
- What the fuck is this?

39:13.684 --> 39:14.684
- Gabriel?

39:17.421 --> 39:19.456
Just teaching her a lesson.

39:19.457 --> 39:20.991
- Hola, papacito.

39:27.732 --> 39:29.099
- Fuck!

39:29.100 --> 39:30.768
She's just a bitch!

39:31.769 --> 39:33.603
She's just a whore...

39:33.604 --> 39:34.904
- No.

39:34.905 --> 39:36.340
She's our guest.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.189
- I'd like to take you
to see your father,

39:47.213 --> 39:48.581
if that's okay.

39:50.955 --> 39:54.325
Clean her up, and get
her some clothes.

40:18.482 --> 40:19.917
- Papi?

40:22.219 --> 40:23.987
Papi? - Mija!

40:23.988 --> 40:24.988
- Papi!

40:27.291 --> 40:29.626
- What are you doing here?

40:29.627 --> 40:31.060
Are you hurt?

40:31.061 --> 40:32.941
Let me look, let me look...
- I'm-I'm fine, dad.

40:32.965 --> 40:33.330
I'm fine.

40:33.330 --> 40:34.165
What's going on?

40:34.166 --> 40:35.832
I wanna go home!

40:35.833 --> 40:37.066
- I know.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.169
I know, I am working
as hard as I can

40:39.170 --> 40:41.571
to get us both out of here.

40:41.572 --> 40:44.575
It will only be a little
bit longer, I promise.

40:53.317 --> 40:54.784
- Okay, okay, that's enough.

40:54.785 --> 40:55.619
Time to go.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.786
- No...

40:56.787 --> 40:57.621
- It's okay.

40:57.622 --> 40:58.721
You be good.

40:58.722 --> 40:59.722
- No!

41:01.526 --> 41:02.526
- Thank you.

41:02.527 --> 41:03.794
Thank you.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.730
- Finish my father's weapon.

41:07.731 --> 41:09.933
And I'll promise you...

41:09.934 --> 41:12.435
I'll send your daughter home.

41:12.436 --> 41:13.370
- Dad!

41:13.371 --> 41:14.371
Dad!

41:14.372 --> 41:15.840
No, no!

41:25.416 --> 41:29.253
- I hope it treats you
better than it did us.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.501
- What is this, beef?

41:44.502 --> 41:46.603
- No, it's carne de chihuahua.

41:46.604 --> 41:50.406
Relax, it tastes just
like a porterhouse.

41:50.407 --> 41:51.841
- How'd it go at the
junkyard today?

41:51.842 --> 41:53.322
Heard y'all ran into
a bit of trouble.

41:53.346 --> 41:54.744
- Eh, couldn't have been better.

41:54.745 --> 41:56.045
But if you ask me, that old man

41:56.046 --> 41:57.514
was more vicious than the droid.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.449
- Yeah, he was feisty.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.284
- Yeah, he wanted cash money.

42:01.285 --> 42:02.519
And he wouldn't drop his price

42:02.520 --> 42:04.554
until it started
shooting at him.

42:04.555 --> 42:06.089
- Reminds me of my grandma.

42:06.090 --> 42:07.524
Man, that lady could haggle.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.165
She knew where all the
yard sales were at.

42:09.166 --> 42:10.767
- Your recon turn
up anything useful?

42:10.768 --> 42:11.928
- It didn't happen.

42:11.929 --> 42:13.630
We were only there 10 minutes
before it got too hot.

42:13.631 --> 42:14.964
- Fuckin' canners
everywhere, man.

42:14.965 --> 42:16.125
- You should have seen Chris.

42:16.149 --> 42:17.149
He almost shit his pants.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.842
- If I did, it looked
like your black ass.

42:20.137 --> 42:21.417
- Shut up before
I beat your ass.

42:21.441 --> 42:22.975
- Okay, bring it.

42:23.941 --> 42:25.542
- Enough good times.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.610
We hit the club at 22:30.

42:27.611 --> 42:29.512
Let's make sure it's smooth.

42:29.513 --> 42:31.080
- All right, I'll give the
truck the ol' mani-pedi,

42:31.081 --> 42:32.582
and make sure she's
fully serviced.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.343
- Shit, you know what
else you could service?

42:34.367 --> 42:34.752
My dick!

42:34.753 --> 42:37.887
- You wish.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.323
- Luke's got some gear for you.

42:40.324 --> 42:43.160
Make sure you know
how to use it.

42:53.370 --> 42:56.406
- What are you doing
here, Wright?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.341
I mean by all accounts,
you should be rotting

42:58.342 --> 43:01.377
another 100 years in prison.

43:01.378 --> 43:03.313
So what's the deal?

43:03.314 --> 43:06.917
- Just here for the bad
guys, like always.

43:08.686 --> 43:11.956
- Yeah, I'm not that
much of an idiot.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.457
It's gotta have something to do

43:14.458 --> 43:18.228
with that shit they put
it your head, right?

43:19.296 --> 43:21.131
Tell me what it does.

43:22.866 --> 43:24.935
- It makes my brain
work faster than yours.

43:27.504 --> 43:28.606
- All right.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.408
You can keep your secret.

43:32.409 --> 43:35.411
But somethin'
doesn't make sense.

43:35.412 --> 43:38.515
And I don't like it when
things don't make sense.

43:40.150 --> 43:41.584
- Carson.

43:41.585 --> 43:43.720
Do you have a moment?

43:43.721 --> 43:45.990
- He's all yours, A.D.A.M.

43:50.094 --> 43:51.327
- Excellent.

43:51.328 --> 43:53.029
I was curious as to why
you are not listed

43:53.030 --> 43:55.131
in any of my military indexes.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.433
So I began searching
the world's internet.

43:57.434 --> 43:59.102
I have compiled a
folder of records

43:59.103 --> 44:01.304
which I believe
appertain to you.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.073
Though I am 99.5%
certain of this,

44:04.074 --> 44:08.345
I must satisfy the other 0.5%
chance that this is not...

44:09.580 --> 44:14.484
So Carson, is this you?

44:14.485 --> 44:15.952
Carson?

44:15.953 --> 44:18.855
Excuse me Carson, but you have
yet to answer my question.

44:18.856 --> 44:20.023
Shall I repeat it to you?

44:20.024 --> 44:21.959
- Turn it off!

44:23.794 --> 44:25.161
- Strange.

44:25.162 --> 44:28.231
Your heart rate and respiration
have increased by 35%.

44:28.232 --> 44:30.767
This suggests an overall
increase of emotional stress,

44:30.768 --> 44:32.369
anxiety, or anger.

44:35.205 --> 44:37.440
Have I angered you, Carson?

44:37.441 --> 44:40.677
- I think you answered
your own question.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.245
- I am programmed to learn,

44:42.246 --> 44:43.813
to identify on my own,

44:43.814 --> 44:46.683
with the variables that
sway and ultimately decide

44:46.684 --> 44:49.118
my own conclusions.

44:49.119 --> 44:52.088
Did the images
upset you, Carson?

44:52.089 --> 44:53.289
Interesting... - A.D.A.M...

44:53.290 --> 44:54.258
- It was not my intention

44:54.259 --> 44:56.626
to do so. - A.D.A.M.!

44:56.627 --> 45:00.164
That's enough.

45:18.115 --> 45:19.449
- I'm sorry.

45:19.450 --> 45:21.551
But this is the best I can do.

45:21.552 --> 45:24.153
You shouldn't have
any trouble here.

45:24.154 --> 45:25.388
- Thank you.

45:25.389 --> 45:26.989
But can't you please let us go?

45:26.990 --> 45:28.692
I promise, I won't say anything.

45:31.028 --> 45:32.528
- It's impossible.

45:32.529 --> 45:35.531
Your father is the only man
who can give us what we want.

45:35.532 --> 45:38.802
He cannot leave until
his work's done.

45:45.008 --> 45:48.045
You remind me so
much of my mother.

45:52.649 --> 45:54.084
She was beautiful, too.

45:59.757 --> 46:02.860
I promise, it will
all be over soon.

46:55.813 --> 46:58.047
- Fellas, it's time to nut up.

46:58.048 --> 46:59.583
We're a go in 30.

47:00.951 --> 47:02.218
Luke?

47:02.219 --> 47:03.779
- A.D.A.M., bring up
the nightclub file.

47:03.803 --> 47:04.803
- Of course.

47:07.524 --> 47:10.126
- From what we know, the
club isn't well-protected.

47:10.127 --> 47:12.795
A camera system that A.D.A.M.
shouldn't have trouble with.

47:12.796 --> 47:15.665
There are armed
guards here and here.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.934
These are entry points.

47:17.935 --> 47:21.038
Smash and storm, and
quick and easy.

47:22.105 --> 47:23.973
The real fun starts
when we're inside.

47:23.974 --> 47:25.908
We'll be going in blind.

47:25.909 --> 47:27.376
This is the office.

47:27.377 --> 47:30.980
This is where we expect
to find Alarcon.

47:30.981 --> 47:33.115
Take a good look at him, boys.

47:33.116 --> 47:34.483
We need him alive.

47:34.484 --> 47:36.986
- What's the timeframe like?

47:36.987 --> 47:38.988
- ET's 10 minutes.

47:38.989 --> 47:42.925
If we don't find Alarcon by
then, the op is terminated.

47:42.926 --> 47:45.462
Rotate back and regroup here.

47:46.363 --> 47:47.363
Questions?

47:48.532 --> 47:50.968
All right, let's get to it.

48:10.954 --> 48:12.788
- Just who I wanted to see.

48:12.789 --> 48:14.290
Check these things out.

48:14.291 --> 48:16.392
Newly-issues MICH helmets,
internal cooling system,

48:16.393 --> 48:18.494
upgraded anti-ballistics.

48:18.495 --> 48:20.497
These fuckers kick ass.

48:21.965 --> 48:23.300
Just put it on.

48:31.108 --> 48:33.242
- Syncing with the
MICH Version 3.

48:33.243 --> 48:35.111
Cooling system's at 100%.

48:35.112 --> 48:37.313
Anti-ballistic threshold, 100%.

48:37.314 --> 48:39.382
Optic systems, 100%.

48:39.383 --> 48:43.085
MICH Version 3100% functional.

48:43.086 --> 48:45.354
- Fuckin' technology, man.

48:45.355 --> 48:46.689
I feel like an astronaut.

48:46.690 --> 48:49.125
- You'll get used to it, man.

48:49.126 --> 48:51.427
- What, you guys
too cool for this?

48:51.428 --> 48:53.129
- Oh yeah, that shit's
too clunky for me.

48:53.130 --> 48:55.411
Plus, I gotta show off my
handsome face on the battlefield.

48:55.435 --> 48:56.332
You know.

48:56.333 --> 48:57.653
- Yeah, I need
complete visibility

48:57.677 --> 48:59.437
when I'm goin' all Bruce
Lee on them bitches.

49:00.537 --> 49:02.097
Those are not designed
for hand-to-hand.

49:02.121 --> 49:04.206
- I guess I'll be the
guinea pig, then.

49:04.207 --> 49:07.376
- No, no Wright, you're just
smarter than these two.

49:07.377 --> 49:09.578
Those helmets give you a
measured tactical advantage.

49:09.579 --> 49:10.414
It's just math.

49:10.415 --> 49:11.647
- Oh, math?

49:11.648 --> 49:14.116
Like one plus one
equals fuck you.

49:14.117 --> 49:15.451
- Whatever.

49:15.452 --> 49:18.988
Listen, I won't be there
with you tonight.

49:18.989 --> 49:21.657
So, don't get fuckin' killed.

49:21.658 --> 49:23.459
- I thought you
were ready, ready.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.127
- I am ready.

49:25.128 --> 49:26.448
But I think it's
best for the team

49:26.449 --> 49:28.009
if I chill here and
get some stuff done.

49:28.033 --> 49:29.231
- Oh, okay.

49:29.232 --> 49:32.234
Make sure you get the
windows, house mama, okay?

49:32.235 --> 49:34.670
Fuck you.

49:34.671 --> 49:35.905
Uh...

49:35.906 --> 49:39.242
Wright, can I talk
to you for a minute?

49:41.578 --> 49:44.380
Listen, A.D.A.M. told
me what happened.

49:44.381 --> 49:46.248
Don't hate him too much for it.

49:46.249 --> 49:47.529
He's still learning some things,

49:47.553 --> 49:50.119
and it's gonna take
some getting used to.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.988
But trust me.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.824
He'll save your life.

49:57.361 --> 49:59.229
All right, gentlemen.

50:01.498 --> 50:02.799
Good luck.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.849
- Gabriel!

50:19.850 --> 50:20.684
- Si?

50:20.685 --> 50:22.519
You wanted to see me?

50:23.920 --> 50:27.823
- The Americanos are
their way to the club.

50:27.824 --> 50:30.026
They're searching
for the engineer.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.261
- Who told you this?

50:32.262 --> 50:36.199
- The Marines have a
little rat on their team.

50:37.534 --> 50:41.138
He whispers all their
secrets, for cheese.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.173
- Then why not tell me sooner?

50:44.174 --> 50:47.009
My men and I could have
killed him by now.

50:47.010 --> 50:49.512
- Because I need
the new one alive.

50:49.513 --> 50:52.049
Gearside is hiding something.

50:53.717 --> 50:57.653
Something about that
Americano is special.

50:57.654 --> 50:59.156
Whatever it is...

51:00.557 --> 51:03.093
I'm going to get it from them.

51:04.061 --> 51:05.061
- Fine.

51:06.063 --> 51:09.800
Then I will go to the
club and take him alive.

51:14.204 --> 51:16.940
- I'm not done with you yet.

51:22.045 --> 51:23.813
- What's this?

51:23.814 --> 51:24.880
Hmm.

51:24.881 --> 51:25.881
Ah...

51:27.517 --> 51:29.618
This is my failure as a father,

51:29.619 --> 51:32.189
and your failure as a son.

51:33.123 --> 51:34.958
- She means nothing!

51:35.826 --> 51:38.562
No!

51:44.935 --> 51:46.636
- Love is weakness.

51:48.939 --> 51:53.210
Bring me the Americano, or I'll
lay your body next to hers.

52:24.241 --> 52:27.511
- This is the only
mother that I need.

52:39.856 --> 52:41.557
- So, uh...

52:41.558 --> 52:43.826
I still can't figure it out.

52:43.827 --> 52:45.327
Why you?

52:45.328 --> 52:46.328
Why here?

52:47.397 --> 52:49.231
What's your endgame?

52:49.232 --> 52:51.934
- Just another expendable piece.

52:51.935 --> 52:52.935
- Nah.

52:53.904 --> 52:56.272
I ain't that stupid.

52:56.273 --> 52:58.875
What really happened in Ira...

53:27.737 --> 53:29.205
- Guards disabled.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.806
- A.D.A.M., take
out the cameras.

53:30.807 --> 53:33.642
- Cameras deactivate in five,

53:33.643 --> 53:34.477
four,

53:34.477 --> 53:35.312
three,

53:35.313 --> 53:36.679
two,

53:36.680 --> 53:38.448
cameras now offline.

53:52.529 --> 53:53.929
- Something's wrong
with the camera.

53:53.953 --> 53:56.089
Go find out what happened.

54:05.508 --> 54:09.346
The only protection I'll be
needing right now is this.

56:18.108 --> 56:20.110
- Carson!

56:21.911 --> 56:22.911
Carson!

56:36.126 --> 56:37.860
- We'll take care of
things down here.

56:37.861 --> 56:39.981
You and Wright head up to the
office and take Alarcon.

56:40.005 --> 56:42.064
10 minutes, no more.

56:42.065 --> 56:43.432
All right?

56:43.433 --> 56:44.933
Quick and easy, no mistakes.

56:44.934 --> 56:45.769
Ooh rah!

56:45.770 --> 56:47.903
- Ooh rah!

56:47.904 --> 56:50.140
- Head on a swivel.

57:03.287 --> 57:04.287
- Stairs.

57:04.288 --> 57:05.488
How's it going?

57:13.997 --> 57:15.464
I'll hold them off!

57:15.465 --> 57:17.399
You find the target!

57:17.400 --> 57:18.500
- What?

57:18.501 --> 57:20.503
- Go!
- Back in a flash.

57:22.605 --> 57:24.206
- Sir, I took the
liberty of rerouting

57:24.207 --> 57:25.974
the building's security system,

57:25.975 --> 57:28.710
and I have successfully
accessed the video feeds.

57:28.711 --> 57:30.946
That said, there are a
dozen or so armed men

57:30.947 --> 57:32.147
approaching the building.

57:32.148 --> 57:33.508
- You couldn't have
said so sooner?

57:33.532 --> 57:36.535
- I suppose I could have, yes.

57:50.266 --> 57:53.769
- Mickey, we've got
multiple contacts!

57:53.770 --> 57:55.003
Mickey?

57:55.004 --> 57:56.284
A.D.A.M., you got
eyes on Mickey?

57:56.308 --> 57:57.439
- Yes sir.

57:57.440 --> 58:01.478
Sergeant Stauskas is currently
on the second floor.

58:06.549 --> 58:08.417
Mickey, can you hear me?

58:08.418 --> 58:10.719
- Loud and clear, cowboy.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.187
What can I do for you?

58:12.188 --> 58:14.389
- Sergeant Hernandez
requires you to contact him.

58:14.390 --> 58:15.492
Immediately.

58:19.863 --> 58:21.630
- Yes sir.

58:21.631 --> 58:24.501
Just as soon as I
find my rabbit.

58:29.472 --> 58:32.708
- By rabbit, I assume you
mean, Miguel Alarcon.

58:32.709 --> 58:35.677
If you like I can
scan for heatsign...

58:35.678 --> 58:36.613
Sergeant?

58:36.614 --> 58:39.649
Our signal seems to be drop...

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:18.447
- Wright, Mickey's
not answering!

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:21.016
Don't let your guard down,
and get the fuck down here!

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:22.185
We're in trouble!

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:34.029
- Didn't mean to
spoil your fun, huh?

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.598
- No, please, I'll give
you whatever you want.

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:37.599
Please!

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.135
- No.

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:41.236
No, you know what?

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:42.537
Get up.

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.473
I don't want to kill
a man on his knees.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.241
- No, please!

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:47.709
Please, I'll tell you where.

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:50.178
Malvado is hiding, please!
- Stand the fuck up!

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:52.080
- No, he has a girl and
he has the father.

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:52.915
Please!

01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:53.915
Please...

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:56.418
- No.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:57.419
- Please...
- Fuck you.

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:03.992
Shit.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.495
Look at my boots.

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.312
Shit.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:32.154
- Where's Alarcon?

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.323
- He drew first.

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.562
- I just saved your
fuckin' ass, big time!

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.696
- Huh, what?

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:16.098
No-no, you didn't.

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:16.966
- Look behind you man!

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:17.834
Open your fuckin' eyes!

01:02:17.835 --> 01:02:19.502
- I had him anyway.

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:41.690
- Took your sweet fuckin' time.

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.125
- Did you miss us?

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:45.060
What the fuck happened to you?

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:45.895
- What, man?

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:47.095
Had to use Excalibur.

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:47.997
- Bitch, you actually
named your knife?

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:49.397
- You know it.

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:50.832
- Where the fuck was Alarcon?

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.201
And where the fuck were you?

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.669
- He's dead.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:55.638
- Dead?

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:56.839
Did you get anything out of...

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.110
Americanos!

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.454
I'm here to collect your heads!

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.889
- Jesus Christ,
fuckin' Barney, man!

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:14.824
- Fuck.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:16.291
Fuck, I'm hit in my side.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.994
- So I can take them
back to my father.

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.428
And receive his approval.

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.264
Shit!

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:24.767
- And cut his fucking heart
out with a crucifix!

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:28.136
- We gotta move.

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:30.005
- Jesus, fuckin', my arm!

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.166
Oh, fuck, I'm hit in my side!

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:34.476
Shit!

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.477
Shit...

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:37.412
All right.

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:39.093
Mickey and I will try
to divert their fire.

01:03:39.094 --> 01:03:41.174
When that happens, you guys
make a run for the truck.

01:03:41.198 --> 01:03:42.050
- Oh, come on!

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:44.187
Get up and die like
good soldiers do!

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:48.924
- A.D.A.M., can you display
their video feed on my lens?

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.425
- Hello, Carson.

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:52.093
It's good to hear
your voice again.

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:54.396
- A.D.A.M., shut up,
there's no time for that.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:55.864
Can you play the feed?

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:56.799
- Yes.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.633
Rerouting feed to your lens now.

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.068
- All right, good.

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:01.436
Mickey, on my mark.

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.004
Run left as fast as you can.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.005
And we'll see if we can
turn these tin cans around.

01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.508
All right?

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:06.342
Ready?

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.043
Three, two, one.

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:09.278
Go!

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.084
- That's it.

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:18.287
This is the American way.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.559
- Come on, come on!

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:26.661
- You better not tell
anybody about this.

01:04:26.685 --> 01:04:27.685
- Just fuckin' run!

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.099
- A distraction.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.667
It's okay.

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:36.771
The one that I really
want is right here.

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:38.541
- Now what?

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:41.516
- How about you and me
go around the world

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.142
on these toasters?

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:46.716
- You're one crazy
son of a bitch.

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:52.021
- I'm right here!

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.690
- Now!

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:39.001
- What the fuck is this?

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:56.117
- Jesus Christ, what
the fuck happened?

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.719
- We were outnumbered
four to one.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.954
Get the med kit!

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.355
- Those fuckers were
waiting for us!

01:06:00.379 --> 01:06:03.692
We'll fix you up.

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:04.627
- Fuck, guys.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.962
Wait, where's Hernandez?

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:07.963
- Dead.

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.765
- He was taken out by droids.

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.267
There was nothing we could do.

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:13.202
- What about the mark?

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:14.769
Did you guys get anything?

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:16.571
- It's a dead end, literally.

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:18.240
- It was him or me.

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:21.648
- Things are all kinds of
fucked up right now, guys.

01:06:21.672 --> 01:06:22.577
- Excuse me gentlemen,

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:26.582
but I have an incoming Holocall
for Sergeant Hernandez.

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:29.752
- Uh, I got it.

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:37.158
- Wright, where's Hernandez?

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.660
- He's dead.

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:39.894
They were waitin' for us.

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.596
- What about the location?

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:43.231
Do you know where
Flores is being held?

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.733
- Negative.

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:45.934
- Damn.

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.435
- There's a rat
leaking information.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:48.670
- An informant?

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.938
Impossible.

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.073
I'm the only soul alive
that knows you're there.

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:54.042
- Listen to me, someone
is selling us out.

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.763
We got a dead Marine and
another one wounded

01:06:55.787 --> 01:06:57.379
because our op is
being compromised.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.947
- Listen, Wright.

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:01.383
Failure is unacceptable.

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:02.917
Forget the rat.

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:04.886
Flores is the key.

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.287
Find him.

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:07.822
Do what you have to do.

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:09.924
But don't come home without him,

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:12.560
or you won't have a home
to come fucking back to.

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:13.561
- Fuck!

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:17.899
- I guess that's it, boys.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.068
Back on the yellow brick road.

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:21.670
- Not necessarily, Toto.

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:50.265
- Damn.

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:51.367
You've been busy.

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.839
Anyway, after scrubbing
his memory silos,

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.274
I discovered a
tracking algorithm

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.176
hidden in the main controller.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.778
Basically, it stored every
route this thing's traversed

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.246
since its assembly.

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.082
- Knew every route?

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.017
What are you sayin'?

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:11.654
- I'm sayin' I know
where they are.

01:08:13.722 --> 01:08:14.824
- All right.

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:19.627
It's about time we get the
drop on these sumbitches.

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:21.029
- Definitely.

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:22.029
- Yeah.

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:25.934
- Get some rest.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.669
Then tomorrow, we
take it to 'em.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:28.670
Good work.

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:57.866
- Jefe?

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.837
He's dead, they killed him.

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:09.712
Gabriel is dead.

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:13.148
We couldn't do anything.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.085
The building was
filled with them.

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:24.460
- May Santa Muerte bless you.

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:28.096
- No!

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.442
- Oh, my little rat.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.714
- What's up?
- Hey.

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:48.082
Check this out.

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:52.020
- What is it?

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.321
- Oh nothing, just something
that should stop a droid

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:54.589
in its tracks.

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.357
- A grenade?
- Kind of.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.426
I call it an IED-EMP.

01:09:58.427 --> 01:09:59.627
Made 'em this morning.

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:01.529
- Sounds good, what's it do?

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:06.167
- So when it's thrown, it resonates
a strong magnetic field,

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:08.570
adhering it to any
metal surface, right?

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:10.738
- So kind of like a uh,
sticky bomb for droids?

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.240
- Exactly.

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:14.943
Except instead of blowin' shit up,
it fries any electrical devices

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.578
within its radius.

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:18.213
- I like the sound of that.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.494
- Wait, Christmas
isn't over yet.

01:10:19.518 --> 01:10:21.216
I got more.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:24.085
So last night, as I was
analyzing the droid's systems,

01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:26.921
I got to thinking
maybe, just maybe,

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:30.692
I could add a subroutine,
modify its existing code.

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:31.726
- Okay?

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:33.361
And that means?

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:35.396
- A virtual machine.

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.532
An operating system, within
an operating system.

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:39.300
Luke, slow down, okay?

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:41.402
Just in English, please.

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:42.737
- Maybe you should sit.

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:43.672
You wanna sit?

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:44.672
- Yeah.

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:47.643
- All right.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:52.681
It's a way for A.D.A.M.
to hijack a droid.

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:55.551
A.D.A.M.!

01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:56.818
- Hello, Carson.

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:58.253
- Whoa, dude, put your gun down.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.521
It's A.D.A.M..

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:01.823
- That-that's A.D.A.M.?

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.092
- Yeah.

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:07.629
- Luke, what the
fuck did you do?

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.465
- I gave us another soldier.

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.501
- You crazy sumbitch...

01:11:25.015 --> 01:11:26.015
How we doin'?

01:11:26.016 --> 01:11:27.582
- Good to go.

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:28.883
- How's that's wound?

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.618
- Just a scratch, you know.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:31.720
- All right.

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.657
- Whoa, Jesus.

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:37.792
- I am not gonna get used to
that any time soon, guys.

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.460
- It's just A.D.A.M..

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:41.362
He's perfectly safe, to us.

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:44.699
To them, he should
be pretty brutal.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.067
- Hey boys.

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:47.302
Guess it's that time, huh?

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.583
- All right, let's
kick some ass.

01:11:48.607 --> 01:11:50.476
- All right.

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.255
You can go sit next
to your boyfriend.

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:32.681
Let's see if these
bad boys work.

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:53.701
- Ooh wee, why didn't
we use these sooner?

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:54.936
- I don't know.

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:57.271
I never thought of
them before, I guess.

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:58.272
- Whew.

01:12:58.273 --> 01:12:59.108
All right.

01:12:59.109 --> 01:13:00.475
Stewart, Chris.

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:01.843
You guys hang back.

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:04.412
They might be comin'
on hot, so be ready.

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:05.347
- Okay.

01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:06.914
All right, well, good luck.

01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:08.416
- We don't need luck.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:09.551
We're too badass.

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:13.655
- All right, well,
don't die, badass.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.990
- Security camera, two o'clock.

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:17.291
It's rotational.

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.793
- I see it.

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:20.862
Okay, on my mark.

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:22.698
Go, go, go, go!

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.734
- Yo, the hell with this.

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:30.406
I'm goin' back to the
truck, take the big bitch.

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:17.952
- Clear.

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:24.792
There.

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:26.761
A.D.A.M., can you tap
into these feeds?

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:28.296
Display it on my lens?

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.398
- Unfortunately, while
synced to this droid,

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:32.800
my ability to traverse
systems is limited.

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:33.801
- Shit.

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:37.939
All right Luke, I'm gonna
need you to be my eyes, okay?

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.140
You stay here.

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:41.008
Report to me anything
that I need know.

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:42.543
Mickey, you stay with him.

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.479
Pull security.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.415
We meet up once I've
secured Estevan.

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:48.683
- Roger that.

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.124
- All right, let's
do this, A.D.A.M..

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:17.845
My God...

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:21.015
Whew.

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:22.884
Look at all this money.

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:25.186
- It's actually cocaine, Carson.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:28.489
Crystallized tropane
alkaloid narcotic.

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:30.491
Obtained from the leaves
of the coca plant,

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:32.527
it is highly addictive,
and in high doses,

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:33.995
can cause cardiac arrest.

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.263
- Yeah.

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.964
Remind me to grab a
brick for later.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:39.067
- Understood.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:42.336
- Activation.

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:43.671
- What the hell?

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:44.606
- It appears they have produced

01:15:44.607 --> 01:15:45.706
a new model of the droid.

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:46.808
Fascinating.

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:51.279
It's actually quite
an ingenious design.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.313
- Yeah, that's helpful.

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:53.548
- Indeed.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:54.829
Shall I engage in
combat, Carson?

01:15:54.853 --> 01:15:56.321
- Yes, engage, engage!

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:04.258
Don't just stand there!

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:05.259
Move!

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:20.642
- About fuckin' time.

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:45.866
- Shit!

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.704
That thing's insane!

01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:51.072
- Yeah.

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:53.508
That shouldn't be a problem.

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:56.979
Not one of them suspect me.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.949
It's kind of sad, really.

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:05.454
Yes sir, that works just fine.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:10.592
Yeah, they won't
know what hit 'em.

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:30.878
Any more direct hits,

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:33.147
and your helmet won't
withstand the impact.

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.917
- Oh, yeah, I don't
plan on it, mom.

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:39.086
EMP!

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:49.030
Damn, those fuckers work.

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:50.064
- Activation.

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:51.266
- Not yet.

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:01.108
It appears its armor
is too dense,

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:03.078
insulating it from the
grenade's effect.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:07.515
- Shit!

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:10.284
Shit!

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.507
- Your helmet has been
rendered useless.

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.777
Another hit would be fatal.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.434
- Activation.

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:02.636
Activate.

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:03.672
- A.D.A.M.!

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.107
EMP!

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.924
- This droid can no longer
impede your mission.

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:26.160
Shall we continue?

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:27.161
- No...

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:14.176
- Yeah, it's done.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.578
Yeah, send some
more men outside.

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:20.047
You got two of 'em
by the entrance.

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:21.283
Yeah.

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:31.091
- You're a real piece
of shit, you know that?

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:32.993
- Excuse me, what was that?

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:35.362
- You're a real piece of shit.

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:36.198
- Oh.

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:37.565
Thank you.

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.600
I am a piece of shit.

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:41.168
But you know what?

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:45.673
Pretty soon, I'm gonna be a
real rich piece of shit.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:46.675
- Fuck you.

01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:51.613
What kind of bastards sells
his brothers out for money?

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:54.849
- Okay.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.717
Okay, fair question.

01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:57.986
Fair question.

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:00.754
How about the kind that
doesn't want to die

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:02.857
in fuckin' Mexico?

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.818
Or the kind that doesn't
want to go back to the US

01:21:04.842 --> 01:21:08.195
and fuckin' blow his
own brains out?

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:09.430
No.

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:11.866
There is no glory
in this for us.

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:12.867
None.

01:21:13.603 --> 01:21:14.603
So you know what?

01:21:14.604 --> 01:21:16.370
I'm cashin' out, bitch.

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:17.838
And you?

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:19.340
You...

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:21.543
Oh, you can stay here and
die with your brothers.

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:25.413
- What the fuck?

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:40.561
- That's right.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:43.398
You should have
stayed in prison.

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:47.134
- Man, it's been way too long.

01:21:47.158 --> 01:21:48.269
Something's gotta be wrong.

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:50.104
- Shit, this ain't lookin' good.

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:51.605
- Maybe another ambush?

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:53.107
- You think?

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:55.028
- Shit's possible with
that fuckin' rat out there

01:21:55.052 --> 01:21:56.920
givin' us up.

01:21:57.914 --> 01:21:58.914
- Shit, contact!

01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:00.147
- Shit!

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:01.616
- Yeah, shit's definitely wrong!

01:22:10.151 --> 01:22:11.311
- You have an uncanny ability

01:22:11.335 --> 01:22:13.460
to disappoint us, Mr. Malvado.

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:16.697
And we don't handle
disappointment well.

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.666
- That's too bad.

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:20.567
Because I'm breaking my promise.

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:23.804
And I'm taking your
droids, and your money.

01:22:23.805 --> 01:22:26.407
- You're making a very
large mistake, Malvado.

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:29.077
One you will soon
live to regret.

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:32.313
- I've made many
mistakes in my life.

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:36.750
Bowing down to a little man
like you isn't one of them.

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:38.319
You want blood?

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.587
It pours freely here in Juarez.

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:42.424
Listen to me you...

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:47.362
- Well!

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:50.564
America's finest!

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:53.434
- Jesus, what the fuck is that?

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.303
- That, Senor Rata...

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:59.607
Is the blood of 1,000 Mexicans.

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:05.914
A suit of death, and
my chariot to power.

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:10.151
- Holy shit, you built a mech?

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.054
What the fuck, are you Japanese?

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:24.265
- All right, which one, Mr. Rat?

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.035
- Him.

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:29.937
- Well...

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.272
No horns?

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:33.441
Not no wings?

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:36.878
Just a gringo.

01:23:46.454 --> 01:23:49.824
So, what the fuck you
doin' in my town?

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:52.260
- Vacation.

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:59.133
- So, you're just
a tourista, huh?

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:00.702
Taking in the sights?

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.037
Well...

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:08.108
Let us welcome you to Juarez,

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:11.112
with some real
Mexican hospitality.

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:18.987
We will have a great time.

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:29.129
- What is, what is going on?

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:30.164
Why are these men here?

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:31.165
- Shut up!

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:41.109
Stand him up!

01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:45.579
- Get the fuck away from me!

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.282
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:49.085 --> 01:24:50.085
Huh?

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:51.319
Showtime.

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:57.892
Always ready to stick your
nose where it don't belong.

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:02.362
You think you can
just dive in, no?

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:05.933
But here in Juarez,
great white sharks

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:07.435
swim the streets.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:13.607
And...

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.110
We eat everything.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:17.512
Right down to the bone.

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:22.851
Now, gringo.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.522
I'm gonna want some answers.

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:32.960
But I don't think you're
gonna give 'em to me.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.395
- Don't do it...

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:36.898
- Do what, this?

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:41.035
Ah, that's too easy.

01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:44.071
Engineer!

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.013
Power up the guns.

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:56.984
- Is this what you want?

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.219
It'll tear him apart.

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:00.388
- Perfecto.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.057
- No.

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:06.861
No, I-I will not
be a part of this.

01:26:07.862 --> 01:26:10.532
- "No, I will not be a be a"...

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:17.070
You, power up the gun, or I
will drag your daughter in here

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:19.173
and she can take his place!

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:20.008
- No!

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:21.008
Please!

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:27.649
God forgive me...

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:35.455
- No!

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.662
- You have to wait
your turn, Carson.

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:42.663
- No!

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:47.302
- I swear, I didn't
hit him that hard.

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:51.005
- It's the chip.

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:54.242
- What chip?

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:57.644
- You need to break
the chip set that is

01:26:57.645 --> 01:27:00.347
hard wired in his head.

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:03.217
It is designed to emit
electrical impulses which

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:04.718
are set on a continuous loop.

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:08.622
It disrupts the
pathways of the brain.

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:10.958
- How the fuck do
you know all that?

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:13.894
- 'Cause I am the one
who designed it.

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:16.998
This man, his name
is Carson Wright.

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:23.137
It is sad to say, but he should
have died a long time ago.

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:26.840
- And what does it do?

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:29.443
- It's a master control.

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:30.811
It, uh...

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:34.916
Commands a large number
of droids at a distance.

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:38.652
- Iran?

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:43.124
Yes.

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:45.692
- So...

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:51.198
So, you're the loco

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:54.802
that burned an entire
village with droids.

01:27:57.305 --> 01:28:00.474
You know, they banned droids
because of that shit.

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:02.510
Changed the whole world.

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:11.418
Don't get too used to
that hardware, huh?

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:13.787
'Cause I'm gonna rip it
right out of your head.

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:16.089
- Go to hell, you
fuckin' coward.

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:17.457
- Soon.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:21.396
But how about first, I send
your friend ahead of me?

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:27.668
Do it.

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:34.508
Do it! - Please, I-I-I cannot.

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:36.243
- Yes, of course you can.

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:38.378
You just have to
press a few buttons.

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.280
- Don't do it, Estevan!

01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:43.650
- Shut up!

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:46.254
- Go on, show him my new guns.

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:54.329
You shoot him...

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:59.433
Or you will be seeing the
insides of your daughter.

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:00.634
- Why?

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:01.635
Why are you doing this?

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:04.138
I-I have finished the suit...

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:19.219
- No!

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.054
No!

01:29:20.055 --> 01:29:21.322
I'll kill you!

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.027
- What the fuck?

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:33.067
Kill this piece of shit!

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:40.575
- Come on, you fuckin' rat!

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:54.688
- Holy shit!

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.724
Come on, open the suit!

01:29:58.159 --> 01:29:59.693
- There!

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:02.496
Now please, let me take my
daughter home now, please!

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:03.730
- That's impossible.

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.532
Your daughter is
with Santa Muerte.

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:06.533
- No!

01:30:06.534 --> 01:30:07.814
- And now you're
going there too!

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:43.438
- Let's show these putos
what death really is!

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:49.843
- You are advanced AI, correct?

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.379
- Yes.

01:30:52.513 --> 01:30:54.348
- Listen...

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:56.984
L-listen to...

01:31:05.226 --> 01:31:07.227
- Hey, tourista!

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:09.329
This is my fuckin' city!

01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:10.264
And all you gringos

01:31:10.265 --> 01:31:11.331
are trespassing!

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:13.100
- Oh, fuck!

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:23.611
- Hey, Americano!

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:28.649
Dead or alive, don't worry,
I'll take care of your head.

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:35.022
With that chip, I can
command an entire army.

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:39.793
And then, not just Juarez,

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:43.064
but all of Mexico
will bow at my feet!

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:46.199
- You are severely injured.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:50.471
If medical attention is not
sought soon, you will die.

01:31:51.239 --> 01:31:52.607
- Incredible...

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:56.009
Are you programmed...

01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:58.179
To imitate human emotion?

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:01.349
- No, why?

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:05.886
- Was that man your friend?

01:32:05.887 --> 01:32:07.387
- Friend?

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:09.623
That distinction is...

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:10.858
I don't know.

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:17.198
- Did you share...

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:21.067
Important things together?

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:22.603
- Yes.

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:27.275
- Then he was your friend.

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:30.377
- A.D.A.M., can you see Flores?

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:31.545
- Yes.

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:33.346
In fact, I'm staring
right at him.

01:32:33.347 --> 01:32:34.181
- Uh, the chip.

01:32:34.182 --> 01:32:35.682
The chip, can he fix it?

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:38.785
- Can you repair the
chip in Carson's head?

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:39.786
- No...

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:42.790
It was never broken.

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:46.593
They paid me to s-sabotage it.

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:47.962
- Uh, A.D.A.M.?

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:51.665
- Carson, do you
think you can lead

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:53.700
this monstrosity outside?

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:55.368
We may have devised a plan.

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:57.737
- Ah, it's about
time, goddamn it.

01:32:57.738 --> 01:33:00.941
- Does that mean yes?

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:03.244
- You bet your ass it does.

01:33:07.048 --> 01:33:08.548
- Why are you running?

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:10.483
I thought Marines had courage!

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:13.753
That boy stood there
and died like a man!

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:16.991
Are you a coward,
or a real marine?

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:34.140
- Wait!

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:35.775
Don't shoot him!

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:37.445
This bitch is mine!

01:33:57.398 --> 01:34:00.701
- Come on, goddamn it, let me
shoot this son of a bitch!

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:18.718
- Gentlemen, if you're
still alive out there,

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:19.953
Carson is heading your way,

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:21.921
and in need of your
immediate assistance.

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:24.058
- Give me a second, I'm
just taking out the trash.

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:52.118
- Ooh, I'm a bad man!

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:52.953
Damn!

01:34:52.953 --> 01:34:53.821
- What the fuck?

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:54.821
I had him!

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:01.828
What, no, no, no!

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:02.862
Don't bring him here!

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:03.863
Shit!

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:15.375
- What the fuck is that?

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:16.696
- That robo-suit
is being operated

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.244
by Angel Malvado.

01:35:18.245 --> 01:35:19.780
- That motherfucker's a suit?

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:22.816
- Oh, God!

01:35:23.951 --> 01:35:25.252
That's one big robot.

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.955
You got an EMP?

01:35:30.224 --> 01:35:32.059
- My first strike, let's do it.

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:37.097
What's wrong, Americanos?

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:39.366
You guys always talk so tough!

01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:44.171
But look at you now, when
someone else has all the toys!

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:46.773
You run...

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:47.774
Fuck!

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:01.734
- What the fuck is
that thing made of?

01:36:01.758 --> 01:36:04.594
- It bought us some
time, let's roll!

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:10.363
Shit!

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.236
- Thought you could
run around forever?

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:20.040
- Oh!

01:36:20.909 --> 01:36:21.909
God!

01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:23.076
Move, move, move!

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:24.077
Fuck!

01:36:39.326 --> 01:36:41.628
A.D.A.M., where is
this plan of yours?

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:43.296
- I just initiated
the launch sequence

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:44.465
of 20 droids.

01:36:45.499 --> 01:36:47.934
- And that helps us how?

01:36:47.935 --> 01:36:50.236
- I am currently en
route to your location,

01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:51.471
and will explain presently.

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:54.874
A.D.A.M.?

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:55.876
A.D.A.M.!

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:12.292
- Before the political
pig banned it,

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:15.729
bullfighting was in every
coliseum in Mexico!

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:20.133
And as a boy, there was
no greater pleasure

01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:23.503
than seeing el
torero run his sword

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:26.573
straight through a bull's spine!

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:28.776
Time to die, little bull!

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.549
- Come on, A.D.A.M.!

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:40.754
- Don't worry
bitches, I got you!

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:51.332
- You guys are like cucarachas!

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:54.635
I hate cucarachas!

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:01.741
- No!

01:38:01.742 --> 01:38:02.977
- Grenade!

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:14.054
- Americanos, it's
time to end this game.

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:40.180
- Carson?

01:38:41.382 --> 01:38:42.382
Carson?

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:48.722
Carson?

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:54.794
Carson?

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:57.631
Carson, get up.

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.608
Carson, you still have to fight.

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:10.076
- Carson, get up.

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:12.212
- It's time to send you back
over the border, gringo!

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.280
In pieces!

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:19.052
- Please refrain from
attempting to damage

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:22.389
my friend.

01:39:25.059 --> 01:39:26.926
- I don't know what
the fuck you are,

01:39:26.927 --> 01:39:31.198
but it's gonna take more than
one droid to take me under!

01:39:32.466 --> 01:39:34.801
- Interesting that you
should mention that.

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.736
It just so happens
that a friend of mine

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:39.073
can control an entire army.

01:39:44.144 --> 01:39:45.379
- Hey!

01:39:52.886 --> 01:39:54.053
Fuck you!

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:56.223
My own fuckin' droids?

01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:02.763
You stupid metal corpse!

01:40:04.398 --> 01:40:06.499
- Oh, A.D.A.M...

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.502
You sneaky sumbitch...

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:12.772
- You fuckin' idiots!

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.307
My armor's too thick!

01:40:14.308 --> 01:40:15.942
You have no chance!

01:40:15.943 --> 01:40:17.611
I'll rip you apart!

01:40:24.818 --> 01:40:27.620
Vamonos, you piece of shit!

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:28.821
Get up!

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:29.822
Come on!

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.228
Fuck!

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:50.277
Hey, gringo!

01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:54.213
You think it's over?

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:57.984
It's not over 'til Santa
Muerte says it's over!

01:40:57.985 --> 01:40:59.720
And she still wants blood!

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:03.122
- You can go tell Santa Muerte

01:41:03.123 --> 01:41:05.059
she can go fuck herself!

01:41:14.468 --> 01:41:17.237
- Did we win, Carson?

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:22.508
- Yeah, something like that.

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:24.544
- Doesn't feel like it.

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:27.081
It doesn't make me feel good.

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:31.017
- Violence solves
problems, A.D.A.M..

01:41:31.018 --> 01:41:34.221
It doesn't always
make you feel good.

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:38.492
I'm goin' home.
