00:18.889 --> 00:21.889
(suspenseful music)

00:37.000 --> 00:38.313
- What are you reading, Glory?

00:39.667 --> 00:43.860
- [Glory] When a puppy's
running from the bus, daddy.

00:43.860 --> 00:46.947
- What is the square root of 31,329?

00:51.202 --> 00:53.035
- [Glory] 283 and 177.

00:55.690 --> 01:00.593
- Then what is the cubed root of 6,850?

01:04.187 --> 01:05.019
- Mom, 19.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.273
- Right.

01:09.300 --> 01:13.433
Truth, what is the square root of 25?

01:15.570 --> 01:16.403
- Seven.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.244
- Truth.

01:19.244 --> 01:20.077
- What?

01:21.346 --> 01:23.602
What's the square root?

01:23.602 --> 01:25.435
- [Dad] You know that.

01:26.942 --> 01:29.609
(cars crashing)

01:36.239 --> 01:37.253
- [Pastor] Death is thy victory.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.840
Lord we thank you for the
gift of your resurrection

01:43.840 --> 01:45.423
and it's promise to us.

01:47.220 --> 01:50.950
Lord, take unto thee the
souls of your faithful

01:50.950 --> 01:53.900
Anton and Gabriella Vinci,

01:53.900 --> 01:56.430
eternal rest grant to the oh Lord,

01:56.430 --> 01:58.653
and let perpetual light shine upon them.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.203
May they rest in peace.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.400
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,

02:05.400 --> 02:08.160
and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.233
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:20.450 --> 02:23.237
- [Cassie] It's just starting to sink in.

02:23.237 --> 02:24.673
I'm gonna miss them so much.

02:27.245 --> 02:28.970
- [Poppy] I just hope
the kids will accept me

02:28.970 --> 02:30.313
as their parent, Cassie.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.770
- You'll be great, Poppy.

02:35.642 --> 02:37.192
- I just wish you lived closer.

02:40.550 --> 02:42.350
- I've been offered a
position at a law firm here,

02:42.350 --> 02:43.897
so we'll see.

02:45.177 --> 02:48.010
(uplifting music)

04:41.215 --> 04:44.710
- Dudes, check out the kiddie clothes.

04:44.710 --> 04:47.510
- Cute, I love the straps
with the buttons on the front.

04:47.510 --> 04:49.703
- Makes it easier to change her diapers.

05:18.275 --> 05:19.108
- Morning class.

05:19.108 --> 05:21.732
- [Student] Morning Professor Goldstein.

05:21.732 --> 05:23.295
- Everybody have your project updates?

05:23.295 --> 05:24.628
- [Students] Boo

05:29.892 --> 05:34.892
(screaming)
(heavy guitar music)

05:42.473 --> 05:46.910
- Ms. Vinci.

05:46.910 --> 05:49.040
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:51.230 --> 05:52.063
- Very well.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.133
Shall we begin?

05:58.360 --> 06:00.903
Well Ms. Vinci, it looks
like you're first and only.

06:06.068 --> 06:09.870
- The project I'm developing
is an electromagnetic wave

06:09.870 --> 06:13.590
mood variance monitor,
or mood gun for short.

06:13.590 --> 06:16.020
It remotely measures primary
human emotional levels

06:16.020 --> 06:17.723
or moods with accuracy.

06:20.610 --> 06:24.800
Each emotion generates an
internal electromagnetic field

06:24.800 --> 06:27.330
with a slightly different wavelength.

06:27.330 --> 06:30.410
An EM signal beamed toward
a person is modulated

06:30.410 --> 06:33.470
by the internal emotional
fields and front to back.

06:33.470 --> 06:36.090
The modulated reflective
wave is then compared

06:36.090 --> 06:37.640
to pre-programmed parameters

06:37.640 --> 06:39.460
and converted into a pie graph

06:39.460 --> 06:42.223
which each color representing
the six basic emotions.

06:44.547 --> 06:47.108
- [Professor Goldstein] Ms.
Vinci, can you enlighten us

06:47.108 --> 06:49.510
as to how you differentiated
between the emotion fields?

06:49.510 --> 06:51.230
- [Glory] Quite simple, professor,

06:51.230 --> 06:54.620
I've performed extensive
tests on multiple volunteers,

06:54.620 --> 06:57.126
exposing them to predetermined
situations on video.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.540
As I measured their response,

06:59.540 --> 07:02.610
I noted each emotion
generated a specific variance

07:02.610 --> 07:03.763
in the EM field.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.743
- Excellent, Ms. Vinci.

07:08.620 --> 07:09.623
Fascinating project.

07:17.530 --> 07:19.480
Please report to my office after class.

07:32.830 --> 07:35.330
(phone rings)

07:42.255 --> 07:43.088
- Hello?

07:43.088 --> 07:44.510
- [Tom] Mr. Vinci?

07:44.510 --> 07:45.803
- Yeah, it's me.

07:45.803 --> 07:48.541
- [Tom] Tom Blater here,
I told you about the rent.

07:48.541 --> 07:51.458
And you're now three months behind.

07:52.587 --> 07:54.485
- Okay, Mr. Blater.

07:54.485 --> 07:55.845
- [Tom] My client has been very patient.

07:55.845 --> 07:57.442
- I had some help.

07:57.442 --> 07:59.227
- [Tom] I'll need the back
rent plus next months rent

07:59.227 --> 08:01.365
in two weeks and if you still do it again,

08:01.365 --> 08:02.781
we will follow eviction proceedings.

08:02.781 --> 08:04.281
Do you understand?

08:30.339 --> 08:33.172
(uplifting music)

08:52.255 --> 08:53.323
- Boo.

08:53.323 --> 08:56.630
- Oh my God, Professor, don't do that.

08:56.630 --> 09:00.420
You scared me, don't
sneak up on me like that.

09:00.420 --> 09:01.403
- Sorry I'm late.

09:02.870 --> 09:03.773
- Am I in trouble?

09:04.630 --> 09:07.493
- No, providing you keep
your retaliation bloodless.

09:08.397 --> 09:11.263
- They're bullies, they deserve it.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.600
- Well, Ms. Vinci to your question,

09:14.600 --> 09:16.320
the faculty were concerned
you hadn't applied

09:16.320 --> 09:17.473
to a graduate program.

09:19.930 --> 09:22.080
- I gave it considerable
thought, Professor,

09:22.080 --> 09:24.890
but Poppy's getting on in years.

09:24.890 --> 09:26.623
I worry about leaving him alone.

09:28.420 --> 09:29.253
- I see.

09:30.810 --> 09:32.700
I mean you've already
identified the potential

09:32.700 --> 09:35.917
for using a ray gun as a
medical diagnostic tool.

09:35.917 --> 09:38.553
That alone could qualify
you for a fellowship.

09:39.741 --> 09:42.173
- But Professor I just turned 12.

09:43.790 --> 09:45.310
- Chronologically.

09:45.310 --> 09:47.030
- And I'm unaware of any research groups

09:47.030 --> 09:49.210
seeking pre teen staff.

09:49.210 --> 09:52.290
Which grad school wants an
adolescent in their program?

09:52.290 --> 09:54.143
I'd be a huge legal liability.

09:55.630 --> 09:59.240
- Maybe, but I'm sure they'd
focus on your mental abilities.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.590
You're extraordinary learning capacity.

10:01.590 --> 10:04.541
- So Professor, would I be the researcher

10:04.541 --> 10:06.173
or the lab rat?

10:09.600 --> 10:10.433
- Oh.

10:12.750 --> 10:13.583
Well?

10:14.640 --> 10:17.343
Surprise, surprise.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.440
And we don't have a suitable
program for you at this college

10:24.440 --> 10:27.850
so the faculty promoted
your abilities elsewhere.

10:27.850 --> 10:30.990
We've received inquiries from
three prominent universities

10:30.990 --> 10:33.373
and that came from
Stanford U just yesterday.

10:35.310 --> 10:36.751
- Thank you, Professor!

10:36.751 --> 10:38.584
Thank you so, so much!

10:40.860 --> 10:41.780
- It would be tragic to let

10:41.780 --> 10:43.647
this opportunity slip away, Glory.

10:46.458 --> 10:49.041
(techno music)

11:34.361 --> 11:37.680
- Ciao, Dobo, do you
wanna keep me company?

11:37.680 --> 11:39.030
How are you my tiny friend?

11:40.220 --> 11:41.130
Guess what?

11:41.130 --> 11:42.943
I have such exciting news to share.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.133
- Nice moves.

12:09.730 --> 12:13.460
The ray gun project looks
like it's coming along.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.960
You're ready for me to review?

12:15.900 --> 12:18.462
- I reconfigured the circuitry
to increase effective range.

12:18.462 --> 12:20.638
I think I got it now.

12:20.638 --> 12:22.943
- Oh, well it looking real good sweetie.

12:26.930 --> 12:30.213
So, what was that envelope?

12:50.417 --> 12:52.253
Glory, why didn't you tell me?

12:53.800 --> 12:56.330
Stanford invited to Glory to apply

12:56.330 --> 12:58.673
to their graduate research program.

12:59.758 --> 13:02.683
- Hooray, I get the
bathroom all to myself.

13:04.060 --> 13:07.100
- Argh, the smelly boy fouls the air.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.490
- Hardy har, at least I
changed my underwear this week.

13:11.902 --> 13:14.023
- What are you doing in my lab?

13:15.875 --> 13:17.273
- What's up Truth?

13:18.915 --> 13:19.748
Soon.

13:24.090 --> 13:27.753
Congratulations, mi angela, fantastico.

13:30.494 --> 13:32.873
- I still need to apply.

13:32.873 --> 13:36.387
- That's a formality, they want you.

13:36.387 --> 13:40.510
- But the costs are
huge, so it can't happen.

13:40.510 --> 13:42.230
Maybe we could get a patent on the ray gun

13:42.230 --> 13:45.060
and sell the rights,
that could pay my costs.

13:45.060 --> 13:48.230
- Well, then you need to finish this.

13:50.673 --> 13:52.340
- [Glory] Stop that.

13:55.212 --> 13:57.879
(driving music)

14:14.927 --> 14:17.140
Here we go, Pops, ready, set.

14:20.647 --> 14:24.107
Totally awesome, what do
you feel like right now?

14:27.329 --> 14:28.162
- Hungry.

14:40.412 --> 14:41.293
- What's that?

14:41.293 --> 14:44.663
- It's a pie graph, doofus,
it shows Poppy's moods.

14:46.170 --> 14:47.573
What's bugging you, Grandpa?

14:49.130 --> 14:51.530
- Well no, I'm okay.

14:51.530 --> 14:55.350
- Baloney, Pop, look sad is 40 percent.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.853
- He was looking at the
family photos this afternoon.

15:05.410 --> 15:06.243
- All right.

15:06.243 --> 15:09.333
All right, you gonna find out anyway.

15:11.530 --> 15:13.880
The lawyer from the home owner's called

15:14.850 --> 15:17.153
and we owe them three month's rent.

15:19.792 --> 15:21.573
- Why didn't you pay?

15:23.560 --> 15:25.320
- I had to pay for the new lab equipment,

15:25.320 --> 15:27.903
I thought it was more important.

15:29.730 --> 15:31.053
Now we got no money.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.293
- So what then?

15:38.737 --> 15:40.613
- I'm gonna get an eviction notice.

15:41.514 --> 15:42.670
- We're being evicted?

15:42.670 --> 15:43.970
Evicted?

15:43.970 --> 15:45.610
- If we cant' pay.

15:45.610 --> 15:48.173
- What's, where are we gonna go, Grandpa?

15:50.090 --> 15:51.923
- I don't know, tutti.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.943
If I can't take care of you,

15:56.260 --> 15:58.430
they could put you both in foster homes

15:58.430 --> 16:00.180
and I couldn't do nothing about it.

16:02.589 --> 16:04.920
- But you're our legal guardian, right?

16:04.920 --> 16:07.560
They can just farm us
off to foster parents.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.960
You should call Aunt Cassie.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.390
- But if we could get a patent, huh?

16:16.390 --> 16:19.770
We could make enough dough to pay the rent

16:19.770 --> 16:22.733
and your tuition and we
wouldn't need a lawyer.

16:23.960 --> 16:24.960
- How do we do that?

16:26.648 --> 16:29.565
(pounding on door)

16:47.680 --> 16:49.273
- Where's our money, Giuseppe?

16:53.460 --> 16:54.293
- Kitchen.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.310
- Gotta stash in a cookie jar?

17:00.310 --> 17:02.813
- Yeah, cookies are a buck each.

17:07.453 --> 17:09.660
- You're two weeks behind dead beat.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.680
There better be 10 grand in that jar.

17:12.680 --> 17:13.926
Get him up, Bones.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.190
Where's the rest?

17:36.190 --> 17:37.773
- That's all I got, Mosey.

17:43.040 --> 17:47.473
- This just covers the vig,
and you still owe 60 large.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.750
We're gonna need 10 grand next week

17:53.750 --> 17:55.750
plus a grand for the vig or

17:55.750 --> 17:58.273
- We play batting
practice with your knees.

17:59.170 --> 18:00.573
- Come on, Mosey.

18:01.410 --> 18:05.393
I'm behind in the rent and I
gotta take care of my kids.

18:06.505 --> 18:09.567
- [Bones] Then you better
sell a freaking kidney.

18:09.567 --> 18:10.734
- Bad Grandpa.

18:18.780 --> 18:20.130
I'll give you another week,

18:21.667 --> 18:23.673
but you better find the dough, capiche?

18:29.385 --> 18:30.302
- Hey boss.

18:31.580 --> 18:33.203
This looks interesting.

18:39.246 --> 18:42.496
(upbeat ukulele music)

19:05.326 --> 19:07.470
- Hi sweetie, how was class today?

19:07.470 --> 19:08.370
- Guess what?

19:08.370 --> 19:10.820
Professor Goldstein's
going to contact Stanford

19:10.820 --> 19:13.450
and see if they can
offer me a scholarship.

19:13.450 --> 19:16.126
- Oh Glory, that's fantastic.

19:16.126 --> 19:19.587
- He said no promises,
but it's worth a try.

19:19.587 --> 19:21.470
I'm gonna finish my mood gun.

19:21.470 --> 19:23.470
They may want an example of my work.

19:23.470 --> 19:24.303
- Okay.

19:26.110 --> 19:28.013
Okay, Truth, you ready?

19:28.867 --> 19:29.713
Here come a Pop fly.

19:31.747 --> 19:34.997
(upbeat ukulele music)

20:00.182 --> 20:02.515
(screaming)

20:07.430 --> 20:08.800
- What's happening?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.787
- The gun doesn't work anymore?

20:10.787 --> 20:15.027
See, not working you
clumsy, smelly, idiot.

20:18.363 --> 20:22.187
- Hey, stop screaming before
my head explodes, okay?

20:22.187 --> 20:27.187
- Not okay, no baseball in
my lab ever, understood?

20:36.387 --> 20:38.637
- Hey, whoa, what the hell?

20:40.467 --> 20:42.820
I thought you said it didn't work anymore?

20:42.820 --> 20:44.440
- This isn't mood in flow.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.753
- Is it fixed?

20:47.603 --> 20:52.603
- It appears the mood gun has
run Poppy's credit card data.

20:57.043 --> 20:58.126
- Fantastico.

20:59.246 --> 21:01.329
- I need to work on this.

21:02.563 --> 21:05.146
(techno music)

21:35.200 --> 21:36.950
Mood gun, functional.

21:46.025 --> 21:48.692
Digital data reader, functional.

21:54.905 --> 21:57.155
(shouting)

22:05.610 --> 22:07.410
- I didn't do anything, sis.

22:07.410 --> 22:08.243
- You okay?

22:09.220 --> 22:11.673
- [Glory] I found another
function for the ray gun.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.410
- So you were celebrating?

22:14.410 --> 22:16.717
- No, the ray gun made
me ticklish all over

22:16.717 --> 22:19.246
and I couldn't control myself.

22:19.246 --> 22:21.065
- Oh mia, what next?

22:21.065 --> 22:22.800
Can you do it to me?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.303
- Sure, hold on to your pants.

22:29.326 --> 22:31.576
(laughing)

22:48.227 --> 22:51.644
And that boys, was the low power setting.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.883
- That's three beers, Gramps.

23:06.130 --> 23:07.083
- I'm celebrating.

23:11.720 --> 23:12.900
(belches)

23:12.900 --> 23:13.733
- What for?

23:14.840 --> 23:16.583
- Glory's new invention.

23:18.570 --> 23:21.683
- Which function do you
think will be more popular?

23:21.683 --> 23:26.100
- Well, the mood function
is good for medical

23:26.100 --> 23:30.653
and the tickle function
could replace stun guns.

23:31.490 --> 23:35.280
But a credit card reader could be huge.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.740
- Someone could use it
for illegal purposes.

23:38.740 --> 23:42.180
- Well yeah, you're right,
we don't want no trouble, but

23:46.118 --> 23:48.027
credit card reader could be used by

23:50.170 --> 23:53.340
by businesses like a busy super market.

23:53.340 --> 23:54.940
You don't have to take out your card,

23:54.940 --> 23:57.973
they just scan you with
the credit card reader.

24:00.222 --> 24:01.737
- But it reads all the cards.

24:01.737 --> 24:04.460
How do they know which one to charge?

24:04.460 --> 24:06.390
- They ask of course.

24:06.390 --> 24:08.390
- What if it reads someone else's cards?

24:10.750 --> 24:11.693
- Free food.

24:13.940 --> 24:17.663
- But seriously, this function
crosses into identity theft.

24:19.150 --> 24:22.440
- What happened from the original design?

24:22.440 --> 24:26.500
- Well, the impact disconnect the front

24:26.500 --> 24:29.100
and linear integrator and
converted from mood gun

24:29.100 --> 24:30.350
to card reader.

24:30.350 --> 24:32.440
So I installed a rotary switch that

24:32.440 --> 24:34.610
manually performs the bypass.

24:34.610 --> 24:35.923
Awesomely cool, huh?

24:38.360 --> 24:40.810
The rotor switch also
controls a compensator

24:40.810 --> 24:42.970
that adjusts power output proportionate

24:42.970 --> 24:45.913
to target distance, we
don't any more butt burns.

24:47.170 --> 24:50.537
- No, I got a credit
card branded right here.

24:50.537 --> 24:53.090
- Gee Gramps, whenever
you go to the checkout,

24:53.090 --> 24:55.843
you should pop your butt on the scanner.

24:55.843 --> 24:57.926
(laughs)

24:59.359 --> 25:01.942
(bright music)

25:04.643 --> 25:05.643
I caught it.

25:25.860 --> 25:27.850
- Better set the power switch on low.

25:39.608 --> 25:42.505
- [Police] That kid has
some kind of weapon.

25:42.505 --> 25:43.987
- What the hell?

25:43.987 --> 25:45.737
- He just shot at us.

25:49.768 --> 25:53.018
- Freeze, drop your weapon immediately.

25:54.248 --> 25:56.190
- [Police] Freeze girly, right now.

25:56.190 --> 25:59.107
All of you, hands behind your head.

26:02.487 --> 26:05.347
- Hey, you got no reason
to search these kids.

26:05.347 --> 26:06.310
- You got an ID old man?

26:06.310 --> 26:08.649
- Yeah in my back pocket,
you wanna reach back there

26:08.649 --> 26:09.930
and tickle me a little?

26:09.930 --> 26:11.450
- Quit being cute, old timer.

26:11.450 --> 26:13.000
You got ID for these kids?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.533
- Geez, I forgot my library card.

26:17.116 --> 26:19.133
- That mouth is gonna get
you in a heap of trouble

26:19.133 --> 26:21.773
and you best not be pointing
weapons at police cars.

26:22.983 --> 26:25.823
- For goodness sake, it's
not a weapon, it's a toy.

26:25.823 --> 26:27.890
- Girly, do you know how many officers

26:27.890 --> 26:30.663
are killed by so called
toy guns every year?

26:30.663 --> 26:31.496
- None.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.010
- This is the female you want searched?

26:42.010 --> 26:43.590
She's just a kid.

26:43.590 --> 26:46.060
- Little kid, big mouth.

26:46.060 --> 26:46.893
- Really?

26:46.893 --> 26:48.740
It's quite evident that diplomacy

26:48.740 --> 26:51.340
is not an element of
your training regimen.

26:51.340 --> 26:53.170
- I see what you mean.

26:53.170 --> 26:55.083
Come on, come with me Ms. Smarty pants.

27:03.522 --> 27:07.123
- Mama Mia, look at that, I
thought we lost everything.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.603
- Never disobey police officers.

27:12.680 --> 27:16.203
We have lots of data, let's
test your credit cards, Poppy.

27:25.490 --> 27:27.694
- Looks okay.

27:27.694 --> 27:29.901
♪ Sitting in my room thinking about ♪

27:29.901 --> 27:34.901
♪ All the crazy things we love to do ♪

27:35.018 --> 27:39.319
♪ Just me and you ♪

27:39.319 --> 27:43.994
♪ Can't but smile and laugh because ♪

27:43.994 --> 27:45.577
- Maddy, system on.

27:46.898 --> 27:50.301
- Good evening, Glory, hope you are well.

27:50.301 --> 27:51.970
System ready.

27:51.970 --> 27:54.390
- [Glory] Thank you, Maddy, I am well.

27:54.390 --> 27:56.793
Access file mood gun.

27:56.793 --> 27:59.677
- [Maddy] File mood gun, ready.

27:59.677 --> 28:02.060
- [Glory] Credit cards
heating up and smoking.

28:02.060 --> 28:04.710
Caused by interaction
between electromagnetic field

28:04.710 --> 28:07.410
and the ferrite module in card.

28:07.410 --> 28:10.913
Solution, introduce frequency
modulation circuitry.

28:12.260 --> 28:15.410
- Research complete,
no alternate solution.

28:15.410 --> 28:17.213
- Thank you Maddy, end session.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.237
Lights, turn off.

28:31.239 --> 28:34.118
- [Dad] Pleasant dreams
sweetheart, love you.

28:34.118 --> 28:36.519
- Hi baby girl, I love you.

28:36.519 --> 28:38.642
- [Dad] Pleasant dreams
sweetheart, love you.

28:38.642 --> 28:40.279
- [Mom] Hi baby girl, I love you.

28:40.279 --> 28:43.730
- [Dad] Pleasant dreams
sweetheart, love you.

28:43.730 --> 28:46.133
- So, is this your invention Mr. Vinci?

28:47.719 --> 28:52.700
- Actually, my 12 year old
grand daughter invented it.

28:52.700 --> 28:54.760
- [Mr. Dowds] 12 years old?

28:54.760 --> 28:57.010
Very interesting indeed.

28:57.010 --> 29:00.140
This mood gun has commercial potential.

29:00.140 --> 29:02.070
Tell me, what's the other function?

29:02.070 --> 29:03.610
- [Poppy] It's a card reader.

29:03.610 --> 29:06.200
- Card reader.
- A credit card reader.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.060
You aim at someone, you pull the trigger,

29:09.060 --> 29:11.060
the signal bounce off of the cards

29:11.060 --> 29:12.970
and sends the data back.

29:12.970 --> 29:15.442
- Remarkable, have you tested it?

29:15.442 --> 29:16.923
- [Poppy] Yeah.

29:18.516 --> 29:22.113
Now, we have a little
trouble, but we fix it.

29:23.450 --> 29:25.000
- But it read the cards?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.053
- [Poppy] Accurately.

29:27.310 --> 29:28.920
- All right.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.320
Gentlemen, please excuse
me just for one moment.

29:35.530 --> 29:38.870
- [Mosey] Giuseppe, you never
told us about the card reader.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.890
- [Poppy] Yeah, my Glory.

29:40.890 --> 29:42.423
My Glory invented that too.

29:43.938 --> 29:46.063
- [Bones] The kid is worth
her weight in diamonds.

29:56.590 --> 30:00.370
- Mr. Vinci, we feel
strongly that a card reader

30:00.370 --> 30:04.950
would be illegal, however,
the mood gun has potential.

30:04.950 --> 30:07.370
- No card reader, huh?

30:07.370 --> 30:09.120
- How much potential?

30:09.120 --> 30:11.290
- Well we would need to
do a marketing study,

30:11.290 --> 30:14.200
but devices like this can have huge sales.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.630
Tell you what, if you modify the drawings

30:16.630 --> 30:19.640
to show just the mood
gun, not the card reader,

30:19.640 --> 30:23.053
we'll be happy to represent
you for a fee of course.

30:31.437 --> 30:36.437
- Mr. Dowds, if you think
the mood gun has potential

30:36.940 --> 30:40.613
then you should be happy
to take this project.

30:42.620 --> 30:45.100
Molto grazie for your time.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.363
- [Mr. Dowds] Thank you sir.

30:47.260 --> 30:49.673
- Just give me one more month, huh?

30:49.673 --> 30:51.653
I got a great deal going.

30:51.653 --> 30:54.055
- [Tom] The time limit on
your payment is a disgrace.

30:54.055 --> 30:55.750
No more excuses.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.310
- Excuses, what excuse?

30:57.310 --> 30:58.770
I don't need no stinking excuse.

30:58.770 --> 31:00.612
- [Tom] We will receive
them by the due date

31:00.612 --> 31:01.445
or I'll file an eviction notice.

31:01.445 --> 31:04.040
- My house, your stinking asshole client

31:04.040 --> 31:05.412
stole it from me.

31:05.412 --> 31:06.912
- [Tom] Now do it.

31:09.611 --> 31:12.194
(somber music)

31:49.332 --> 31:51.915
- This is for my family, Mosey.

31:53.615 --> 31:55.198
And you too, Bones.

32:33.615 --> 32:35.948
(screaming)

33:00.735 --> 33:03.652
- [Bones] What are you doing, Pops?

33:23.720 --> 33:26.493
- So, you called?

33:27.810 --> 33:28.643
What do you got?

33:29.780 --> 33:31.053
- I gotta pay you.

33:32.217 --> 33:33.193
I gotta pay rent.

33:36.111 --> 33:36.944
- Grazie.

33:36.944 --> 33:37.777
- I need money.

33:41.090 --> 33:42.590
- You know the program, right.

33:43.720 --> 33:47.283
- Yeah, yeah, I hear all
about the big fortune.

33:48.550 --> 33:51.090
I get jail time if I get caught.

33:51.090 --> 33:52.640
I told you, I got kids.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.120
- [Mosey] Would you hear me out?

33:54.120 --> 33:57.020
Or are we just gonna sip
espresso and discuss the weather?

33:58.040 --> 33:58.993
- I'm listening.

34:01.308 --> 34:02.893
- All right, Giuseppe.

34:04.700 --> 34:06.350
Here's what I'll do just for you?

34:08.010 --> 34:10.929
Like I said, you deliver the data

34:10.929 --> 34:13.373
and we provide you credit cards in return.

34:14.350 --> 34:16.746
Use the cards at ATMs.

34:16.746 --> 34:20.389
You pay us 10 G's a week
until you finish paying off

34:20.389 --> 34:22.708
the 60 G's you owe.

34:22.708 --> 34:27.708
After that, we split the ATM 50 50.

34:27.964 --> 34:29.085
Are you with me so far?

34:29.085 --> 34:30.219
- Yeah.

34:30.219 --> 34:33.960
- Good, now, you tap an ATM,

34:33.960 --> 34:37.000
you do not return to
that machine for a month.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.469
Hit as many as you want, but
one card per transaction,

34:40.469 --> 34:43.652
and one card per ATM, one.

34:43.652 --> 34:47.570
And wear a good disguise,
not some Halloween crap.

34:47.570 --> 34:49.489
They got you on camera.

34:49.489 --> 34:51.393
And please, don't do drag.

34:52.628 --> 34:53.893
Questions.

34:55.550 --> 34:57.483
- Well yeah, two.

34:59.090 --> 35:02.510
First, I'm gonna look crazy I go around

35:02.510 --> 35:04.203
shooting people with a ray gun.

35:05.660 --> 35:07.250
- Yeah, you're right.

35:07.250 --> 35:09.080
An old man wondering
around pointing a ray gun

35:09.080 --> 35:10.843
would not look copacetic.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.972
The kids need to be part of this.

35:15.972 --> 35:17.453
- That's crazy.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.280
You think I'm gonna let my kids go around

35:21.280 --> 35:23.230
shooting people with a ray gun?

35:23.230 --> 35:24.873
So I can steal money?

35:27.050 --> 35:30.050
- They will if they don't wanna
see Grampie in a wheelchair.

35:32.494 --> 35:33.763
- What else?

35:37.430 --> 35:40.803
- I'm gonna need a vehicle
to get around to the ATM's.

35:44.550 --> 35:47.503
- [Bones] Yeah, we'll send over a limo.

35:48.390 --> 35:50.287
How about a freaking hearse?

35:56.330 --> 35:59.713
- [Mosey] Buy yourself a
clunker and add it to the vig.

35:59.713 --> 36:02.223
But the kids, need to
help you collect data.

36:07.420 --> 36:09.073
- Here's 20 accounts.

36:16.610 --> 36:19.460
- [Mosey] So Pops, what's
the magic word, huh?

36:28.212 --> 36:29.379
- Abracadabra.

36:31.913 --> 36:34.163
(laughing)

36:50.850 --> 36:51.763
Glory home?

36:55.500 --> 36:58.373
Oh hey, Glory, sweetie,
come in here a minute, huh?

37:06.360 --> 37:07.193
- What's wrong?

37:10.620 --> 37:12.343
- The lawyer called again today.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.593
They gonna issue an
eviction notice in one week.

37:21.510 --> 37:23.223
No, but I get lucky.

37:24.340 --> 37:27.930
I met two business men
at the patent attorney.

37:27.930 --> 37:28.910
- Business men?

37:28.910 --> 37:32.530
- They're very interested
in the ray gun, yeah.

37:32.530 --> 37:36.640
They say if we collect
lots of credit card data

37:36.640 --> 37:39.410
and pass the information to them,

37:39.410 --> 37:42.130
they gonna make credit
cards and we can use them

37:42.130 --> 37:44.863
to go get cash from the ATM's.

37:45.806 --> 37:49.890
And they even give me a cash
advance to buy a vehicle

37:49.890 --> 37:52.400
so we can go visit the ATM's.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.373
- That's a serious crime, Poppy.

37:58.926 --> 37:59.943
- You're right.

38:01.710 --> 38:04.963
But, I gotta keep us off the street.

38:06.900 --> 38:08.830
If we don't go along with this plan,

38:08.830 --> 38:10.930
we gonna have to find a vacant park bench.

38:10.930 --> 38:13.160
- And if we do go along with this plan,

38:13.160 --> 38:17.163
one day that park bench will
seem like a five star resort.

38:18.670 --> 38:21.597
- Bambini, I can't live without my family.

38:24.620 --> 38:27.993
- If you go to jail,
we won't have a family.

38:31.964 --> 38:32.797
- Give it back.

38:36.470 --> 38:37.393
Give it back.

38:55.370 --> 38:58.050
- [Mosey] Let me be clear, signori Vinci,

38:58.050 --> 39:00.853
we sealed our deal when
you took the advance.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.420
- [Poppy] But I just give it back.

39:03.420 --> 39:06.090
- That deal involves illegal activities

39:06.090 --> 39:07.590
which renders it null and--

39:07.590 --> 39:10.249
- Excuse me, have you
ever heard the expression

39:10.249 --> 39:12.810
honor among thieves, huh?

39:12.810 --> 39:14.700
- I thought you were business men?

39:14.700 --> 39:16.569
- Hey, Giuseppe, put a muzzle on this one.

39:16.569 --> 39:18.380
- Accrediting honor in
thievery seems like a ploy

39:18.380 --> 39:20.440
to justify illegal activities.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.900
- Children should be seen not--

39:22.900 --> 39:24.510
- Anyway, it's irrelevant.

39:24.510 --> 39:26.870
I will not allow my invention to be used

39:26.870 --> 39:28.070
for illegal purposes.

39:28.070 --> 39:32.360
I will destroy the drives
and the ray gun, so there.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.193
- So there?

39:34.190 --> 39:35.023
So.

39:39.180 --> 39:40.243
So there?

39:42.020 --> 39:44.020
Let's see if this will change your mind.

39:46.532 --> 39:48.080
- No, stop, let go of him!

39:48.080 --> 39:50.148
Stop, no, get off of him.

39:50.148 --> 39:50.981
Stop!

39:53.607 --> 39:54.440
Let go!

39:56.846 --> 39:58.179
Leave him alone!

40:08.926 --> 40:09.759
- Stop.

40:15.227 --> 40:16.810
- Put it down, kid.

40:18.278 --> 40:19.278
Put it down.

40:24.636 --> 40:25.469
- Get

40:26.679 --> 40:28.096
out of our house.

40:50.919 --> 40:52.419
- Oh, what's this?

40:55.417 --> 40:57.290
- Get out of our house

40:58.840 --> 41:01.073
Get out or I'll shoot.

41:02.030 --> 41:04.190
- Truthie, no, put it down, put it down.

41:04.190 --> 41:05.703
- These are bad guys, Poppy.

41:07.230 --> 41:09.978
I said get out.

41:09.978 --> 41:11.433
Both of you.

41:15.090 --> 41:16.544
Both of you.

41:16.544 --> 41:18.384
- Don't, don't do it.

41:18.384 --> 41:19.217
- Oh!

41:23.020 --> 41:27.243
- You better stop kid, or I
squeeze til your eyeballs pop.

41:35.020 --> 41:40.020
Wow, four misfires, must be my lucky day.

41:40.220 --> 41:42.360
- [Glory] Yes, Mr.
Bones, very lucky for you

41:42.360 --> 41:44.430
I disabled the firing mechanism.

41:44.430 --> 41:46.203
You should thank me for saving you.

41:47.070 --> 41:48.303
- Very clever, Glory.

41:54.450 --> 41:55.943
How about this one?

41:57.382 --> 42:00.049
(intense music)

42:18.180 --> 42:19.433
Quite impressive, Glory.

42:20.917 --> 42:24.373
And Truth, very brave to
defend your Grandpa like that.

42:25.500 --> 42:30.500
But, I think we got a
communications issue here.

42:31.700 --> 42:34.503
So children, listen to me carefully.

42:35.910 --> 42:38.680
Your Poppy owes us 60 thousand dollars

42:38.680 --> 42:40.493
he lost making bets.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.780
And he also tells us
that he's three months

42:46.780 --> 42:49.940
behind in the rent and
you're gonna be homeless.

42:49.940 --> 42:54.940
So, if you find it immoral,
illegal, or repulsive

42:55.330 --> 42:57.200
to collect credit card data,

42:57.200 --> 43:00.310
and then to get cash from
ATM's using fake credit cards,

43:00.310 --> 43:03.363
and this causes Poppy to
skip out on his payments,

43:05.140 --> 43:06.140
we'll need to employ

43:08.860 --> 43:11.520
extremely unpleasant options.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.070
Care to know what that entails?

43:15.130 --> 43:15.963
Anyone?

43:17.740 --> 43:19.040
Well then, I'll elaborate.

43:20.360 --> 43:23.340
First, we pour concrete
around Poppy's feet

43:23.340 --> 43:25.093
and take him for a dip in the lake.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.640
Next, there's a certain madam in town,

43:28.640 --> 43:31.570
specializes in procuring
young boys and girls,

43:31.570 --> 43:35.870
especially young virgins
for a mid east slavery.

43:35.870 --> 43:38.520
You've heard of child
trafficking haven't you, Glory?

43:39.780 --> 43:42.333
Is that frightening, Glory?

43:48.363 --> 43:51.793
You are a virgin, are you not?

43:53.840 --> 43:54.673
Glory.

44:00.860 --> 44:02.583
- Why did you gamble, Gramps?

44:03.920 --> 44:08.048
- I don't know.

44:08.048 --> 44:08.881
I don't know, I,

44:10.368 --> 44:13.807
with Glory gonna graduate,
you gonna be in high school,

44:14.820 --> 44:17.403
I see this big empty space in my life.

44:18.620 --> 44:22.430
So, I make some small bets and I win

44:22.430 --> 44:24.480
and then I make some
bigger bets and I win,

44:24.480 --> 44:27.773
and I didn't think I was ever gonna lose.

44:30.220 --> 44:32.943
- But then you did, so
why didn't you tell us?

44:47.510 --> 44:48.493
- I was ashamed.

44:50.640 --> 44:53.200
I risked everything.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.893
I put us all in danger.

44:56.990 --> 44:58.113
I'm so sorry.

45:18.184 --> 45:19.017
- Yes.

45:22.368 --> 45:24.785
(rock music)

46:28.427 --> 46:30.723
- Hey, no fair sneaking up from behind.

46:33.467 --> 46:35.287
Wow, cool gun.

46:35.287 --> 46:36.123
Can I try?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.493
Let's look for aliens, you go that way.

47:17.420 --> 47:19.193
- Where's my ray gun?

47:20.448 --> 47:23.163
- I was playing with
another kid and we swapped.

47:24.426 --> 47:25.259
- Doofus.

47:29.370 --> 47:31.620
There, it's moving towards the exit.

47:31.620 --> 47:33.650
Poppy, meet us in the parking lot.

47:33.650 --> 47:35.225
Truth and I need to catch them

47:35.225 --> 47:36.675
before they get to their car.

47:39.286 --> 47:42.453
- [Truth] Hey, hey, that's my ray gun.

47:43.503 --> 47:45.410
- It's mine, we traded.

47:45.410 --> 47:47.360
- Are you some kind of junior con man?

47:47.360 --> 47:48.930
You traded fair and square.

47:48.930 --> 47:51.130
- [Glory] It wasn't his
to trade, it's mine.

47:52.240 --> 47:53.710
So give it back.

47:53.710 --> 47:55.488
- Oh no you don't.

47:55.488 --> 47:56.770
You went and traded, so be on your way.

47:56.770 --> 47:59.940
- Hey, enough, don't
pushing my kids like that.

48:01.617 --> 48:05.240
- Here's his toy mister,
now give mine back.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.627
- Your little brat brother traded

48:06.627 --> 48:08.200
and now you want it back?

48:08.200 --> 48:09.100
He needs a lesson.

48:13.280 --> 48:15.913
- See, no trade, now give it back.

48:17.070 --> 48:17.903
- Son.

48:19.500 --> 48:20.840
Go get in the car.

48:22.568 --> 48:24.985
(rock music)

48:46.443 --> 48:48.080
- You give that back or else.

48:48.080 --> 48:49.080
- Smoke her.

49:24.950 --> 49:28.553
- Too close, tutti, no
more swapping guns, okay?

49:29.580 --> 49:32.013
- We have 52 uncorrupted files.

49:33.290 --> 49:36.663
- [Poppy] A full deck, that
ought to make Mosey happy.

49:41.995 --> 49:45.078
(upbeat dance music)

50:13.635 --> 50:14.468
- Run.

50:26.379 --> 50:28.296
I almost peed my pants.

50:31.035 --> 50:36.035
- Oops.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.083
- Hospitality.

50:54.480 --> 50:56.474
- Can I pour for you Signor Mosentano?

50:56.474 --> 50:59.060
- And molti grazzi Signorina Vinci.

50:59.060 --> 51:00.447
- Signor Bonaiotto?

51:02.390 --> 51:04.690
- And some for Gramps.

51:04.690 --> 51:07.690
Can't leave him out of the
celebration, Ms. Vinci.

51:07.690 --> 51:11.080
- No need to worry, Mosey,
we're all out of arsenic.

51:11.080 --> 51:13.133
- Arsenic, make mine a double.

51:16.298 --> 51:18.563
Here's to a profitable relationship.

51:19.800 --> 51:21.107
- Salut.
- Salut.

51:22.820 --> 51:25.383
- [Mosey] So, what's the occasion?

51:27.515 --> 51:29.990
- I have a payment for you.

51:29.990 --> 51:30.823
- Really?

51:32.070 --> 51:32.903
For what?

51:34.319 --> 51:35.869
- For the gambling bet he lost.

51:39.020 --> 51:41.553
- Oh look, a lovely teddy bear.

51:42.410 --> 51:44.593
Bones, take a look at that.

51:51.310 --> 51:53.863
- Oh yeah, boss, real cute.

51:56.619 --> 51:59.567
Solid too.

51:59.567 --> 52:00.400
- Stop!

52:13.007 --> 52:13.924
- Gee Boss.

52:16.025 --> 52:17.925
I always wanted to whack a teddy bear.

52:20.346 --> 52:24.213
- Now, who was the little
genius rigged this, huh?

52:30.870 --> 52:32.670
- Naughty girlie.

52:32.670 --> 52:36.127
I ought to spank you til
you can't sit for a week.

52:36.127 --> 52:39.146
- If you hurt me, you'll
regret it Mr. Bonaiotto.

52:39.146 --> 52:44.146
Now let me go.

52:51.410 --> 52:52.853
- Now, where were we?

52:55.030 --> 52:58.360
Ah yes, Giuseppe, I
believe you have something

52:58.360 --> 52:59.683
that belongs to us.

53:13.050 --> 53:16.100
Seven thousand, where's the rest?

53:16.100 --> 53:20.460
- Mosey, I gotta pay the back
rent or they gonna evict us.

53:20.460 --> 53:21.293
- Where is it?

53:27.960 --> 53:31.033
- Glory, Truth, please stand.

53:32.970 --> 53:35.053
I said stand up.

53:40.740 --> 53:41.790
- [Madam] Mosey.

53:41.790 --> 53:44.690
- [Mosey] Hello Madam, I
just wanted to show you

53:44.690 --> 53:47.010
the young girl genius we spoke about.

53:47.010 --> 53:47.860
- [Madam] Oh yes.

53:49.324 --> 53:51.700
- [Mosey] Yeah, her and her
brother are here with me now.

53:51.700 --> 53:55.023
- [Madam] A choice candidate, top dollar.

53:56.250 --> 53:58.343
The boy also.

53:58.343 --> 53:59.510
- You bastard.

54:04.410 --> 54:07.060
- [Mosey] Where's it at Pops
or the bambini are next.

54:20.027 --> 54:22.560
- Here, take your lousy money.

54:22.560 --> 54:24.533
Just leave my kids out of this.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.060
- Make your payments on time, Giuseppe

54:37.446 --> 54:40.070
and don't lecture me about the kids.

54:40.070 --> 54:42.033
You brought them into this.

54:44.690 --> 54:45.853
Anything else?

55:12.443 --> 55:14.660
See you next week.

55:14.660 --> 55:15.673
Grandfather.

55:18.187 --> 55:20.520
(whistling)

55:23.040 --> 55:25.020
- I'm shocked that Blater's
rushing to evict you

55:25.020 --> 55:26.740
since you've paid so promptly in the past.

55:26.740 --> 55:28.300
- We're gonna be homeless.

55:28.300 --> 55:30.890
- Look, if you can pay
even a small amount,

55:30.890 --> 55:33.700
it'll show your intent to
honor the rental contract.

55:33.700 --> 55:38.210
- [Poppy] I told him, a
month I can pay it all.

55:38.210 --> 55:41.110
- Good, I'll prepare a
notification of intent

55:41.110 --> 55:42.410
and I'll come by tomorrow.

55:43.846 --> 55:46.950
How are Glory and Truth?

55:46.950 --> 55:49.793
I'm sorry I haven't been
by I've just been so busy.

55:51.490 --> 55:53.970
- The good news is that Glory

55:53.970 --> 55:57.950
got an offer to join the
graduate research program

55:57.950 --> 55:59.742
at Stanford.

55:59.742 --> 56:01.630
- [Cassie] Oh that's fantastic news Poppy.

56:01.630 --> 56:03.180
I can't wait to see them again.

56:10.522 --> 56:11.355
- Glory!

56:15.100 --> 56:16.303
- Poppy, what's wrong?

56:17.542 --> 56:19.964
- Can't breathe, I can't breathe.

56:19.964 --> 56:20.881
- Call 911.

56:31.397 --> 56:32.886
- [911 Operator] 911
Emergency operator here.

56:32.886 --> 56:35.382
Can you describe the problem.

56:35.382 --> 56:38.240
- My Grandfather's having a heart attack.

56:38.240 --> 56:40.090
We're about to administer CPR.

56:40.090 --> 56:41.230
Please send an ambulance.

56:41.230 --> 56:42.850
- [911 Operator] Is an
adult on the premises?

56:42.850 --> 56:44.380
- It's just us adolescents.

56:44.380 --> 56:46.086
- [911 Operator] Okay, so roll the--

56:46.086 --> 56:49.336
- I know CPR, call the damn paramedics.

56:51.883 --> 56:53.040
I'm applying rapid compression

56:53.040 --> 56:55.440
He stopped breathing, he
just stopped breathing,

56:55.440 --> 56:56.557
help me, Truth.

56:57.881 --> 56:59.320
Hurry, put your hands on mine.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.570
When I press down, you do too.

57:01.570 --> 57:02.913
- [911 Operator] Check his pulse.

57:11.239 --> 57:13.174
- Oh my God, it's stopped.

57:13.174 --> 57:15.770
- [911 Operator] Don't
stop, keep doing the CPR.

57:15.770 --> 57:17.600
- Don't you dare die.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.530
Don't even think about it.

57:21.660 --> 57:23.827
(gasping)

57:25.702 --> 57:27.785
- [Glory] He's breathing.

57:28.860 --> 57:30.662
He's breathing.

57:30.662 --> 57:31.912
We got a pulse.

57:49.070 --> 57:51.110
- Are you the Vinci kids?

57:51.110 --> 57:52.930
First, you did great with the CPR.

57:52.930 --> 57:56.200
Grandpa is doing well, but
he needs a coronary bypass.

57:56.200 --> 57:58.130
The good news is, we
already have him scheduled

57:58.130 --> 57:59.180
for tomorrow morning.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.093
- Can he die?

58:03.130 --> 58:05.833
- It's a serious surgery
son, there's always a risk.

58:07.820 --> 58:09.030
- Can we see him?

58:09.030 --> 58:10.363
- Sure, hold on a minute.

58:15.490 --> 58:17.900
He said the kids are
in some kind of danger

58:17.900 --> 58:19.000
and he's the guardian.

58:20.120 --> 58:23.360
- Should we call child
protective services?

58:23.360 --> 58:24.573
- [Cardiologist] That's a good idea.

58:28.010 --> 58:30.160
Hey kids, Grandpa's still under sedation,

58:30.160 --> 58:32.560
but you can sit in the
room with him, follow me.

58:35.740 --> 58:38.323
(techno music)

59:03.492 --> 59:05.133
(phone ringing)

59:05.133 --> 59:06.800
- Don't answer that.

59:38.551 --> 59:40.301
We need to leave now.

59:43.853 --> 59:45.371
- Can you drive?

59:45.371 --> 59:47.121
- How hard can it be?

59:48.333 --> 59:49.833
- Are you allowed?

59:51.175 --> 59:52.925
- Until I get caught.

01:00:04.471 --> 01:00:05.325
- You the Vinci kids?

01:00:05.325 --> 01:00:06.158
- Correct.

01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:13.706
(smooth rock music)

01:00:34.648 --> 01:00:37.970
- Children, do you understand that this is

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.023
for your own care and protection?

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:44.650
- We're quite capable of caring
for ourselves Mrs. Armstrong

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.330
- Sorry dear, you both are underage

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:49.530
with no adult guardian.

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:51.160
So we're placing you with foster parents

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.950
until your Grandfather is well.

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:55.900
You should be grateful we have
a nice home to care for you.

01:01:00.008 --> 01:01:03.106
At that, they've just arrived.

01:01:03.106 --> 01:01:06.888
- Well, well, well, what do we have here?

01:01:06.888 --> 01:01:09.100
- Oh this is definitely kharma.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.100
- [Mrs. Armstrong] Kids,
meet your foster parents,

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.723
Mr. And Mrs. Benedict.

01:01:20.274 --> 01:01:24.230
- Mrs. Armstrong we had
an incident with these

01:01:27.205 --> 01:01:30.007
people last week at the mall

01:01:30.007 --> 01:01:33.377
and they accused us of
cheating their son then--

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.960
- [Mr. Benedict] No, no, no, no, no,

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.980
see that's all been resolved.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.470
And I am sure that Bobby
will be very excited

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.330
to see you again.

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:44.633
- Yes, and he will have
some new playmates.

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:16.110
It's bed time children,
but before light's out,

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:17.533
let's have a little talk.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.270
Agent Armstrong said that
you attend college, Glory,

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:27.090
is that correct?

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:28.424
Don't you feel out of place?

01:02:28.424 --> 01:02:30.488
It seems unfair to have a mere child

01:02:30.488 --> 01:02:33.463
competing with college age students.

01:02:33.463 --> 01:02:35.983
- It isn't a competition, Mrs. Benedict.

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:39.870
- You got quite the arrogant
attitude there young lady,

01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:41.240
if you ask me.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.370
- Well Mr. Benedict, you weren't asked.

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.010
- My, what a snotty little twerp.

01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:48.543
You just earned your
first day in solitary.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.390
- But I have a class project due tomorrow

01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:55.330
and if I don't submit it
I'll fail the course and--

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:56.890
- [Mr. Benedict] Well seeing
as you're so much smarter

01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:57.813
than everybody else, I don't see how much

01:02:57.813 --> 01:03:00.010
that one day is gonna effect you.

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:02.400
- And what is this project?

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.350
- [Glory] The mood gun
Bobby took from Truth.

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:06.570
- Are you serious?

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:07.923
A toy gun?

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.620
- [Bobby] I heard talk about the ray gun.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.423
- It's a mood gun, but I
have plan to develop it

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:16.433
into a medical diagnostic instrument.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.040
- Seriously?

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.530
You're gonna make a medical
diagnostic instrument

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:24.930
out of that piece of crap?

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:26.310
What are you on drugs?

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:28.730
- My sister isn't on drugs

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:31.970
and she's the smartest girl in the world.

01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:33.410
- Shut up, boy.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:36.030
If I want you to talk, I'll let you know.

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:39.490
- Actually, this medical
thingy sounds interesting.

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:41.840
- Yeah, Bobby, your new space gun

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.466
can tell if people got zits or something.

01:03:44.466 --> 01:03:46.850
- [Truth] It isn't his space gun.

01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:48.644
- [Mr. Benedict] I said shut up.

01:03:48.644 --> 01:03:50.360
Now go stand in the corner

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.060
or I'll take my belt to your hide.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.653
I said now, boy.

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:10.980
- [Mrs. Benedict] Well
since it's so important,

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.940
I'll take you to your
house tomorrow before class

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.650
so you can pick up your project.

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:18.100
We'll postpone your stay in solitary.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.830
- But I want it.

01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:21.230
- [Mr. Benedict] Now, now, now, Bobby,

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:24.390
I am sure once she shows it to the class

01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:26.604
Glory will be happy to
let you play with it.

01:04:26.604 --> 01:04:28.707
Ain't that right, Glory?

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:38.900
- [Mrs. Benedict] You should
get a good night's rest.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.705
Tomorrow will be a big day for you

01:04:41.705 --> 01:04:43.393
and you've got lots of chores.

01:05:09.448 --> 01:05:12.448
(suspenseful music)

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:29.837
- What do you want?

01:05:29.837 --> 01:05:32.020
- How do you like your room?

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:36.070
- Cool room, it'd be nice
if we had some video games.

01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:38.360
- Or my cell phone so
I can call the hospital

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.300
and check up on our Grandpa.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.560
- My parents don't let
me play video games.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.250
They say they're too violent.

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:45.900
- [Glory] Bobby, I'm so worried about

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.630
my Grandpa in the hospital.

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:50.170
I really need to find out about him.

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:52.180
Can you get me my cell phone?

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.986
- [Bobby] My parents will kill me.

01:05:53.986 --> 01:05:57.263
- Oh please, please, Bobby, he's so sick.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.530
- Well, okay.

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:03.520
But swear you'll let me
play with the ray gun

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.940
whenever I want.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:05.773
- I promise.

01:06:15.024 --> 01:06:17.324
- Hurry up and make the
call and give it back.

01:06:31.784 --> 01:06:33.617
- [Truth] Awesome sis.

01:06:35.765 --> 01:06:38.598
(uplifting music)

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:27.340
- Van, start engine.

01:07:32.245 --> 01:07:35.162
(tires screeching)

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.963
- Wow, that was awesome sis.

01:07:56.085 --> 01:07:57.385
Can you teach me to drive.

01:07:58.624 --> 01:08:01.957
- Sure, good idea, that could be useful.

01:08:07.562 --> 01:08:10.145
(bright music)

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.800
Truth wake up.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:41.770
Truth wake up.

01:09:49.242 --> 01:09:54.242
Up and at em bro, we got lots to do today.

01:10:09.162 --> 01:10:10.412
- I'm starving.

01:10:12.085 --> 01:10:15.133
- I have lots to do today, so get moving.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.780
- I can't get moving on an empty stomach.

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.984
It's been proven that
other kids can't even--

01:10:23.984 --> 01:10:24.817
- Here.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.373
- I need food sis, food, food.

01:10:31.302 --> 01:10:32.826
Food.

01:10:32.826 --> 01:10:34.160
- We need to leave here.

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.827
Leave, depart, exit.

01:10:37.222 --> 01:10:39.639
Now go do your morning thing.

01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:03.583
Van, start engine.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.863
Locate the nearest ATM machine.

01:11:30.677 --> 01:11:34.094
No, don't turn around, don't turn around.

01:11:41.261 --> 01:11:43.830
- Why are we going to an ATM?

01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:45.770
We shouldn't sis.

01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:46.923
We could go to jail.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.723
- Van, stop engine.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.150
Truth, this may be our last chance

01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:09.150
and I am so done with us
being victims, so listen up.

01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:12.133
- Wow sis, who twisted your panties?

01:12:15.544 --> 01:12:17.660
- Seriously?

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:22.053
Poppy had a heart attack and
he's having heart surgery.

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:27.230
He owes the mobsters 60 grand,

01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:31.070
and if he can't pay they'll
pour him a pair of cement boots

01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:33.263
and drop him in a lake.

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.823
- I'm so sorry I didn't shoot them.

01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:39.870
I wish you didn't fix Poppy's gun.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.673
- We're lucky I disabled
it or we'd all be in jail.

01:12:47.299 --> 01:12:49.160
Blater is going to possess our home

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.950
and boot us into the streets,

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:52.690
where we'd be fortunate to inhabit

01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:57.210
a large cardboard box, but
CPS wants to protects us,

01:12:57.210 --> 01:13:00.533
so they'll send us to the
psycho foster parents from hell.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.190
And the greedy monsters
will surely find us anyway

01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:06.600
and they'll sell us to
the malevolent Madame

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.050
who will deliver us to traffickers

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.480
is the primitive mid east.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:14.480
So, yeah, I am so done
with us being victims.

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:24.222
Besides doofus, you're
hungry, we need gas,

01:13:24.222 --> 01:13:26.833
and we have Poppy's credit cards.

01:13:28.664 --> 01:13:29.497
- I knew that.

01:13:30.461 --> 01:13:32.853
- And after the ATM, we have another stop.

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.207
GPS locate the spy shop.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.303
(upbeat music)

01:14:01.357 --> 01:14:04.720
Truth, go to the kitchen
and start talking, over.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.510
- [Truth] Are we having
broccoli for dinner again?

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:12.053
- Okay, one more, go to
the dining room, over.

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.320
- [Truth] I shot the Mosey,

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.740
but I swear it was in self defense.

01:14:18.777 --> 01:14:21.703
- Awesomely cool, let's see
you find this one Mosey.

01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:26.693
Okay bro, we're good, over and out.

01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:33.237
Testing, one, two, perfetto.

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:42.840
I'm inquiring about
patient Mr. Giuseppe Vinci.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.463
He had surgery today.

01:14:55.132 --> 01:14:56.799
- Van, start engine.

01:15:00.641 --> 01:15:04.850
- Oh crud.

01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:09.850
Van, stop engine.

01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:17.796
- Aunt Cassie.

01:15:18.956 --> 01:15:21.039
I didn't know it was you.

01:15:23.132 --> 01:15:24.020
- Hi Auntie.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.850
- Hi kids, great to see you.

01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:28.160
Is Poppy home?

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.350
- Sorry auntie, he had
bypass surgery this morning

01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:32.773
and he's in recovery.

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.810
- Oh my God, he just
called me the other day

01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:38.363
to help fight the eviction.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.793
I'm so sorry.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.980
Can he have visitors?

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:50.039
- Maybe, but we can't go
because the hospital staff

01:15:50.039 --> 01:15:51.880
ratted us to CPS.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.580
They think we need foster
care until he's well.

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:57.630
Last night we escaped the
foster parents from hell.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:00.750
- Yeah, baby, we're like desperadoes.

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:03.060
- That's outrageous.

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:05.020
Well, I can help with the CPS thing.

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.360
I also have some documents for Grandpa

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.670
to sign on the eviction so

01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:09.880
if you can come with me to the hospital--

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.910
- So we don't have to stay
with our psycho foster family?

01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:15.860
- Well, I'm your aunt so I'm pretty sure

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.018
I can qualify as your legal guardian.

01:16:18.018 --> 01:16:20.440
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.273
- Come on.

01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:34.960
I'll bet it was Blater caused
this with his eviction grant.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.793
- Oh my God, there's so much more.

01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:00.700
Poppy, Poppy, they said
you're going to fully recover.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.413
- I'm gonna be okay.

01:17:05.096 --> 01:17:07.507
- [Truth] They hooked you with
all those tubes and wires.

01:17:07.507 --> 01:17:09.700
- [Glory] Poppy, Cassie brought us here.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:13.030
She's going to help us with
the eviction, remember?

01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:14.003
- Hi, Giuseppe.

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:18.160
- Thank you for helping with this Cassie.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.353
- I'm glad to hear you're
going to be well again.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.903
- I got two guardian angels.

01:17:34.148 --> 01:17:35.950
- Do you wanna talk about the house?

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:37.143
- I'm okay.

01:17:38.296 --> 01:17:39.129
I just,

01:17:41.373 --> 01:17:44.193
Just I, I got no money, Cassie.

01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:49.753
- Poppy, we got this from an AtM.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:53.250
- Oh mama mia, no, you're
not supposed to do that.

01:17:54.994 --> 01:17:56.220
- I told you.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.933
- It's legal Grandpa, I
used your credit cards.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.363
- He's too excited folks.

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:07.096
Mr. Vinci, are you okay?

01:18:07.096 --> 01:18:09.700
- I don't feel nothing, is that okay?

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.883
- If you don't feel any pain, you're okay.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:20.030
- Giuseppe,

01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:21.950
I'll gladly lend you the back rent.

01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:24.250
That should hold Blater
off until you recover.

01:18:25.896 --> 01:18:27.283
- Grazie mia, Cassie,

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.780
I promise I gonna pay you back.

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.583
Even if I have to sell my soul.

01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:35.770
- You already did that Gramps.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.660
- You just focus on getting better

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.050
and let me worry about the kids.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:44.160
I'll pay Tom and have
him quash the eviction

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.410
or we'll file a suit asserting that

01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:48.290
the stress that he created has caused you

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:49.790
personal injury and suffering.

01:18:51.732 --> 01:18:55.060
- I should have called you sooner.

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:56.590
- Strike two people.

01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:59.740
This man just had open heart surgery.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.503
It's not like we removed a wart.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.960
- Maybe we should go.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.853
- Thank you, nurse, we
won't upset him again.

01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:15.660
Poppy, remember when we discussed

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:18.410
having a legal guardian for
the children, just in case.

01:19:19.813 --> 01:19:21.253
- Yeah, a long time ago.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.343
- The chickens have come home.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.343
- Lousy chickens.

01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:30.400
- They want us protected and---

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.510
- They need a legal guardian now

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:35.793
and I would love to do that.

01:19:39.936 --> 01:19:41.150
- You gonna do that too?

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:44.470
- [Cassie] I promise to take
really good care of the kids.

01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:46.634
I guess that's our exit cue.

01:19:46.634 --> 01:19:48.330
Kids, why don't you meet me at the car,

01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:50.517
I need to talk to Poppy for a minute.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.632
This says that the children
are my responsibility

01:20:07.632 --> 01:20:09.593
until you are released.

01:20:27.494 --> 01:20:29.760
- Thank you for all this.

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:33.710
- One more thing.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:38.660
The kids told me about Bones and Mosey.

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.280
I can help with that as well.

01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:47.557
- Now I have three angeli.

01:20:55.117 --> 01:20:56.473
- I'll see you tomorrow, Poppy.

01:20:59.393 --> 01:21:04.393
Okay, get better.

01:21:23.699 --> 01:21:28.449
(screaming)
(rock music)

01:21:45.459 --> 01:21:48.636
- [Mrs Armstrong] Excuse me,
are you attempting suicide?

01:21:48.636 --> 01:21:49.696
Please move.

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:52.257
- [Cassie] You're abducting
my children, let them go.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:04.470
- Ma'am, you appear to
be mentally unstable.

01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:07.010
These are not your kids, now move it.

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:09.993
- [Cassie] I'm not budging
'til you let them go.

01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:14.770
- [Woman] Off the hood and
step out of the way ma'am,

01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:17.233
this is official CPS business.

01:22:17.233 --> 01:22:19.283
- It's not until you release my children.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.690
- [Mrs. Armstrong] Your children?

01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:25.050
I'm with CPS, they're
Granddad is incapacitated

01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:26.960
and reported they're in danger

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.400
so this is an official matter of CPS.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.490
Officer, this woman is irrational

01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:33.198
and she's endangering these children.

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:36.080
- I am their aunt and their attorney

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.553
and now I'm their legal
guardian so back off.

01:22:43.315 --> 01:22:46.520
- I don't care about your
paper, I've got paper too.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.763
- That changed, Mr. Vinci
just gave me custody.

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:57.370
- They are in danger, Ms. Salvatori.

01:22:57.370 --> 01:23:01.000
They need protection, so it's
an official matter for CPS.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.520
- They are now responsibility

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.230
and if they are in danger then I will

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.693
contact the police directly.

01:23:07.710 --> 01:23:09.930
Officer, please remove this handcuff

01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:12.040
or I will file a false arrest complaint.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:13.330
- Officer, this woman is obstructing me

01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:14.830
in the performance of my duty.

01:23:18.899 --> 01:23:21.149
(applause)

01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:30.200
- Thank you officer.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.753
Now, if you don't mind.

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:42.765
(phone ringing)

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:48.577
- Hello Professor Goldstein.

01:23:48.577 --> 01:23:50.060
- [Professor Goldstein] Hello Glory.

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.660
We missed you in class today.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.320
Are you all right?

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.880
- [Glory] Sorry I couldn't be there.

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.597
Poppy had bypass surgery today.

01:23:56.597 --> 01:24:00.570
- [Professor Goldstein] Oh,
so sorry, did it go well?

01:24:00.570 --> 01:24:03.750
- He'll be fine, he just
needs time to recuperate.

01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:06.460
Am I in trouble again?

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:07.879
- [Professor Goldstein] No of course not.

01:24:07.879 --> 01:24:10.178
I have information about
the grad school offer,

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:11.011
but maybe I should hold off.

01:24:11.011 --> 01:24:13.670
- No, no, please, I'd
love to hear about it now.

01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:14.870
Can you come for dinner?

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.630
- There's definitely a disconnect

01:24:21.630 --> 01:24:24.839
between your abilities and
the way people relate to you.

01:24:24.839 --> 01:24:26.690
- It's the story of my life, auntie.

01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:28.710
People can't seem to reconcile my age

01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:30.740
with my mental ability.

01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.650
- That'll get better as you get older.

01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:36.970
But in the mean time, we women
must be strong and assertive.

01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:39.490
We must fight for our
rights and convictions

01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:41.470
or else we'll wind up
barefoot and pregnant

01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:43.953
and chained to the
proverbial kitchen stove.

01:24:48.818 --> 01:24:49.651
Onions?

01:24:51.421 --> 01:24:53.421
- You called me a woman.

01:24:56.018 --> 01:24:57.418
- Oh Glory, you are a woman.

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.723
So much more than many others.

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:15.613
Professor Goldstein, you
remember my brother, Truth.

01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:22.200
And this is Cassie Salvatori,

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.223
our aunt, lawyers, and guardian.

01:25:25.711 --> 01:25:27.403
- Pleased to meet you, Cassie.

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.203
- Likewise Bernie.

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:40.100
- So you mentioned the grad school offer?

01:25:47.319 --> 01:25:49.652
- Cassie, what do you think?

01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:54.660
- Well she's underaged so no dorm.

01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.173
- Living off campus she'll
need to be with an adult.

01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:02.423
Glory, what if Poppy and
Truth were to move there too?

01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:05.753
- It's up to Poppy, but
I think he'd love that.

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.610
- What about you, Truth?

01:26:08.610 --> 01:26:12.720
- Well as long as Mosey
and Bones don't find us.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.730
- We need to put those vermin behind bars.

01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:17.340
- Any ideas?

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:19.500
- I tried to secretly
record their threats,

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.130
but Maddy got busted, literally.

01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:25.070
So I totally bugged the house.

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:28.082
- I'm doubtful they'll
wanna meet here again.

01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:30.553
- Well see, Stanford
could do more for them.

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:50.970
- It was good to meet you Bernie.

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.927
- Same here, Cassie.

01:26:56.336 --> 01:26:57.169
- Call me.

01:27:09.475 --> 01:27:11.959
- Stop it, that was nasty.

01:27:11.959 --> 01:27:13.626
That was disgusting.

01:27:15.878 --> 01:27:16.711
- Uh oh.

01:27:27.824 --> 01:27:32.241
- Buena sera, very pleaded
to meet you Ms. Salvatori.

01:27:34.530 --> 01:27:35.863
- Delighted, Cassie.

01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:42.890
- Good evening, pleased
to meet you Mr. Mosentano,

01:27:43.170 --> 01:27:44.460
Mr. Bonaiotto.

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:49.400
Two what do we owe this
surprise visit gentlemen?

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.100
- Just checking to see the kids are okay.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.973
We heard Grandpa is in the hospital.

01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:56.753
- And we brought them something.

01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:03.323
- Hey kids, you okay?

01:28:04.410 --> 01:28:06.223
- Just peachy thank you.

01:28:08.758 --> 01:28:10.260
- Can we talk.

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:13.410
- We were just leaving, so maybe tomorrow.

01:28:13.410 --> 01:28:14.660
- We'll just be a minute.

01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:32.500
We were shocked Poppy had a heart attack.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.730
- Yeah, sure I'll bet.

01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:37.070
Oops, bad choice of words.

01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:38.750
- Can I get you something to drink?

01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:39.810
- Coffee?

01:28:39.810 --> 01:28:40.940
- I'm good.

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.153
- No thanks.

01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:44.520
- So you brought us something?

01:28:45.479 --> 01:28:47.563
- First a security check.

01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:58.323
Cell phones, on the table ladies.

01:29:00.514 --> 01:29:01.873
Turned off.

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.110
Glory, where's your brother?

01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:21.077
He needs to hear this too.

01:29:21.077 --> 01:29:22.660
- Truth, come here.

01:29:27.297 --> 01:29:29.113
- Kid, you got a cell phone?

01:29:30.010 --> 01:29:31.853
- No, but I want one.

01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:41.463
- So.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.960
Poppy's health is a problem,

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.710
but he still owes us 50 grand.

01:29:47.710 --> 01:29:50.363
So we expect the payments
to continue, capiche.

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:53.390
- Wait, you're expecting these children

01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:54.400
to break the law--

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:57.000
- That's exactly what I'm saying, Cassie.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.910
And now that these little demons
have made you part of this

01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:03.000
and ratted us out on all the details,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.800
you're gonna take Poppy's
place in helping them collect,

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.013
and you're all gonna
pay of the debt or else.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:16.143
I just gave you a stack
of new credit cards.

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:22.320
So, next week we expect
a payment of 10 grand

01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:27.233
plus the vig and 50
files of new card data.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.963
- And if I don't agree?

01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:35.183
- If the cement shoes fit.

01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:38.883
- Not my style of footwear, Mr. Bonaiotto.

01:30:42.727 --> 01:30:43.800
And are you gonna try to sell us all

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.973
to your slave trader Mr. Mosentano?

01:30:48.702 --> 01:30:51.640
- Fortunately for you Ms. Salvatori,

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.233
there's no demand for cougars.

01:30:55.630 --> 01:30:56.750
But we still got that deal

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:58.513
with the Madame we don't get paid.

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:03.130
Are you clear on what you gotta do?

01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:08.013
- Very clear, Mr. Mosentano.

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:22.077
- You got no idea what we
could do to you, sweetheart.

01:32:05.893 --> 01:32:07.702
- Did you get any of that, Glory?

01:32:07.702 --> 01:32:08.952
- I'm checking.

01:32:12.145 --> 01:32:14.812
Yeah, got it all, on the record.

01:32:16.902 --> 01:32:18.145
Woohoo!

01:32:18.145 --> 01:32:18.978
- Yes!

01:32:20.505 --> 01:32:23.672
Got you Mosey and Bones, got you good.

01:32:24.665 --> 01:32:25.945
Good job, Glory.

01:32:25.945 --> 01:32:30.542
- [Truth] I wish we could
send them to jail right now.

01:32:30.542 --> 01:32:33.145
- Auntie, I have an idea.

01:32:33.145 --> 01:32:35.303
Let's keep following them.

01:32:35.303 --> 01:32:37.636
Truth, give me the mood gun.

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.033
Surprise!

01:33:23.323 --> 01:33:25.906
(upbeat music)

01:34:02.747 --> 01:34:05.664
(tires screeching)

01:34:44.458 --> 01:34:46.020
- This a family recipe, Cass?

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.883
- My mom's, Sicilian style.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:54.523
- It's the best lasagna I ever had.

01:34:55.893 --> 01:34:56.726
- [Professor Goldstein]
Well before everybody get

01:34:56.726 --> 01:35:00.090
to groggy from eating this
delicious Italian food,

01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:01.590
I have an announcement.

01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:03.500
This concerns a young
lady I was privileged

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.523
to have in my class at Phoenix college.

01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:09.640
I was notified yesterday that

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:13.840
Stanford University, the
top medical research college

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.780
in the U.S. is offering Ms. Glory D. Vinci

01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:20.793
a full graduate scholarship.

01:35:23.730 --> 01:35:25.480
They're highly interested
in your portable,

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.260
non invasive, medical
diagnostic instruments,

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:30.160
and they'll move your entire home lab.

01:35:33.637 --> 01:35:35.430
It gets better.

01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:38.220
They're going to relocate
the entire Vinci family

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:40.720
and provide them appropriate
quarters near campus.

01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.600
And they're offering Poppy
a job as a lab assistant,

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:48.110
with benefits and Truth gets to attend

01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:50.480
the private school with
complete dependence.

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:52.660
I heard they have an
excellent baseball team.

01:35:56.012 --> 01:35:56.901
- I think I'm in Heaven.

01:35:56.901 --> 01:35:57.734
Did I die?
