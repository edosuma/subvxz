00:03.394 --> 00:06.615
Question: I'm the most sensitive
guy you know.

00:06.745 --> 00:07.833
Not a question.

00:07.964 --> 00:09.313
Thank you.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.098
Why do you sort of ask?

00:11.228 --> 00:12.534
Well, I went on a date
with this woman,

00:12.664 --> 00:14.188
and she said
I wasn't sensitive enough.

00:14.318 --> 00:17.669
Apparently, I'm a bad listener
and... blah, blah, blah.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.150
Look, you're super nice,

00:20.281 --> 00:22.935
but you don't always have
the best attention span,

00:23.066 --> 00:25.590
so it can come off
a little insensitive.

00:25.721 --> 00:26.983
I never noticed that.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.246
I was reading a book
on how crystals

00:29.377 --> 00:31.118
can regulate
your menstrual cycle,

00:31.248 --> 00:32.728
-and... -Bep-bep-bep.
I'm gonna stop you.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.643
I just became hyperaware
of my feet.

00:34.773 --> 00:37.428
Every movement, every twitch.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.430
You know, I have
some great listening exercises

00:39.561 --> 00:41.171
-to help you improve your...
-Bep-bep-bep.

00:41.302 --> 00:42.781
I don't need to,
and I don't need you doing

00:42.912 --> 00:43.608
your little fixy thing.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.436
What do you mean?

00:45.567 --> 00:47.090
You're a meddler.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.787
It's sweet you want to help,
but you go too far.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.267
No, I'm not a meddler.

00:50.398 --> 00:53.705
I just give
amazing unsolicited advice.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.098
I have to leave for my interview

00:55.229 --> 00:56.534
with that big stylist
in 17 seconds.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.449
-How do I look?
-Uh, here, let me just...

00:58.580 --> 01:00.060
Was actually just looking
for validation, but...

01:00.190 --> 01:01.713
She's meddling!

01:01.844 --> 01:04.020
You are gonna crush that meeting
like a soda can.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.500
Oh, thanks for the pep talk.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.241
I actually need it.
I'm super stressed.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.286
I have a shift at Skybucks
right after the interview.

01:09.417 --> 01:11.114
-Guess what?
-Can't guess. No time.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.073
Griffin,
that badass guy I dated...

01:13.203 --> 01:15.205
Who turned out to be obsessed
with collecting Pee Wee Babies?

01:15.336 --> 01:17.294
-Yeah. Not so badass.
-Oh!

01:17.425 --> 01:19.470
-[coughs]
-So, he DM'd me to meet up.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.864
I guess I'm just the one
that got away.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.519
Oh! Well... Oh!
Have him meet you at Skybucks

01:24.649 --> 01:26.173
so I can watch
the whole thing go down.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.610
-Mm. Love you. Bye!
-Love you. Bye!

01:28.740 --> 01:32.135
-Hey, Harper. How are you? Oh.
-Can't talk. No time.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.181
So, Freddie, how's the
glamorous world of tech support?

01:34.311 --> 01:36.922
He asked, sensitively.

01:37.053 --> 01:39.969
It sucks.
But I've saved up almost $4,000,

01:40.100 --> 01:41.101
so pretty soon,

01:41.231 --> 01:42.798
I can move out of my mom's.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.148
Got my eye on a place
with a Peloton on the roof.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.629
It's like cycling but outside.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.719
I just need another thousand
bucks, and I'm good to go.

01:50.849 --> 01:51.894
Which could take a while.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.896
Millicent
just discovered birding.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.724
Strangely expensive hobby.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.901
Maybe you need a side hustle.
You could babysit.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.817
I already do.
All the time. For free.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.601
It's called being a parent.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.647
[phone rings]

02:05.777 --> 02:07.649

Hey, CJ!
[chuckles]

02:56.567 --> 02:58.874
As your friend,
I say, "Hey, queen."

02:59.004 --> 03:00.528
But as your new
assistant manager, I say,

03:00.658 --> 03:02.312
"We need a coach and counsel."

03:02.443 --> 03:04.488
Ooh, is that where we
spill the tea on our coworkers?

03:04.619 --> 03:07.056
'Cause Angel's new purse
is a horror show.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.405
I gave her that purse.

03:08.536 --> 03:11.234
Harper,
you're three minutes late.

03:11.365 --> 03:12.757
I had an important interview.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.846
Working for this stylist
could change my life.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.979
As your friend, I say,
"You go, girl."

03:17.109 --> 03:19.547
But as your assistant manager
coming into their power,

03:19.677 --> 03:22.811
I say, "Do it again,
and you're fired."

03:26.728 --> 03:28.164
Oh, hey, Carly.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.731
You mind flipping off
my assistant manager?

03:29.861 --> 03:31.515
They can't fire you. Oh.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.343
Griffin's over there.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.344
How'd you know that was him?

03:34.475 --> 03:36.216
Oh, he looks
like the kind of guy

03:36.346 --> 03:37.956
who used to wear his backpack
with one strap.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.568
Ooh, you trying
to strap him back on?

03:40.698 --> 03:43.919
Your euphemisms confuse me,
but maybe.

03:45.094 --> 03:46.487
Hey, Carly, over here.

03:46.617 --> 03:47.662
Oh, hey, Griffin.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.490
You look amazing. How are you?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.187
I'm great. How are you?

03:51.318 --> 03:53.668
Are you leaning more
towards stealing motorcycles

03:53.798 --> 03:56.105
or temperature-controlling
stuffed animals?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.760
Oh, my Pee Wee Baby days
are long gone.

03:58.890 --> 04:02.111
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.810
I had to sell them
to pay for my settlement.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.030
Apparently, you can't just say
you're a hypnotist.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.379
Anyway, long story short,

04:09.510 --> 04:12.730
bankruptcy, prison,
I'm infertile.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.558
[chuckles]

04:14.689 --> 04:16.995
This latte is a delight.

04:17.996 --> 04:21.696
Yeah. Uh, so nice to see you,
platonic friend.

04:21.826 --> 04:26.440
By the way, you seem very calm
considering you've...

04:26.570 --> 04:28.572
lived a lot of life.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.618
It's 'cause I found Sand.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.054
Sand?

04:32.184 --> 04:34.012
It's this genius line
of supplements.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.188
I use Calm Sand.
You just take some,

04:36.319 --> 04:39.148
put it in your water, and it
"sands" away the rough parts.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.802
If I didn't have this,

04:40.932 --> 04:43.631
I'd probably drive my motorcycle
off a bridge. [laughing]

04:43.761 --> 04:45.328
[chuckling]

04:46.982 --> 04:48.853
Want to try some?

04:48.984 --> 04:50.899
Sure. Uh,

04:51.029 --> 04:53.031
Sand me.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.512
-So, what's in it?
-Antioxidants, superfoods,

04:55.643 --> 04:57.688
organic mood boosters.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.127
I guess I have
a pretty stress-packed day.

05:05.957 --> 05:06.784
What do you think?

05:06.915 --> 05:09.221
♪ ♪

05:11.789 --> 05:14.096
It's actually amazing.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.490
I've never felt so calm.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.319
Like a snowy owl
on the quiet tundra,

05:19.449 --> 05:21.277
watching the sunrise.

05:21.408 --> 05:25.455
Hoo. Hoo.

05:26.543 --> 05:28.545
You sure
there's nothing in there

05:28.676 --> 05:30.112
the DEA would object to?

05:30.242 --> 05:32.288
[chuckles]
Oh, Spence.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.726
Griffin's made
a ton of money off of it.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.512
Freddie,
this could be your side hustle.

05:38.642 --> 05:39.904
-Hmm.
-Carly...

05:40.035 --> 05:41.079
Not meddling.
Just saying, "Try it."

05:41.210 --> 05:42.777
See if you like it.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.083
There's all different kinds
of Sand.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.737
Griffin gave me
this sample pack.

05:46.868 --> 05:50.001
More like "sand-ple" pack.

05:50.132 --> 05:54.484
[chuckles] Maybe there's some
Funny Sand in there, Dad Jokes.

05:54.615 --> 05:55.920
Sensitivity Sand?
[gasps]

05:56.051 --> 05:58.096
This'll come in handy.
The woman from the other night

05:58.227 --> 05:59.881
wants to give me
a second chance.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.405
She wants to watch a documentary
about a penguin orphanage,

06:02.536 --> 06:05.495
and if I don't cry,
I am gonna hear about it.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.891
Brave Sand. "For people who have
trouble standing up to bullies."

06:10.021 --> 06:11.719
Oh, perfect.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.590
Millicent scheduled
a serious talk with me

06:13.721 --> 06:15.200
when she gets home from school.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.465
I heard back from the stylist.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.118
[ALL]:
And...?

06:20.249 --> 06:21.250
I didn't get it.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.643
[ALL]:
Aw.

06:22.773 --> 06:23.948
I wish I would've
had more time to prepare,

06:24.079 --> 06:25.863
but Skybucks has me opening,
closing,

06:25.994 --> 06:27.212
and in-betweening so much,

06:27.343 --> 06:29.476
I wasn't as ready
as I could've been.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.391
-[ALL]: Oh.
-Stop doing that.

06:31.521 --> 06:34.959
You know what you need?
Happy Sand.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.787
Unless it's sand
under a beach towel

06:36.918 --> 06:39.268
I'm sharing with Cara Delevingne
on a romantic Miami getaway,

06:39.399 --> 06:41.923
it's not gonna make me happy.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.451
You're very welcome. If you'd
like to take a brief survey,

06:48.582 --> 06:50.888
please stay on the... Hello?

06:51.019 --> 06:54.457
Sir, I know you're still there.
You just said, "Click."

06:55.458 --> 06:58.156
I'm ready for our meeting,
Mr. Benson.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.463
[sighs]
Okay.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.596
Let me take
a shot of courage first.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.560
Okay, let's do this.
[exhales]

07:10.691 --> 07:13.258
This is important,
so I put together a presentation

07:13.389 --> 07:16.827
that people from your generation
will understand.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.568
[over computer]:
Extra! Extra!

07:18.699 --> 07:21.353
Breaking news
from the Emerald City.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.964
What's that, you say?

07:23.094 --> 07:25.314
This little girl's
gotten all A's

07:25.445 --> 07:27.795
and still isn't allowed
to have a doggy?

07:29.884 --> 07:32.408
Aw, but she looks so lonely
without a pupper!

07:32.539 --> 07:34.671
How much is that doggy
in the window?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.805
It'll only cost you peanuts.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.424
No.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.557
What?! But I made a video
and everything.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.123
And I'm in the hole
for two clams

07:52.254 --> 07:54.604
on a 1940s lingo app.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.737
I was born in the '90s.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.216
[scoffs]
Look,

07:58.347 --> 08:00.741
having a dog
is a lot of responsibility.

08:00.871 --> 08:03.091
The feeding,
the walking, the pooping.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.875
My God, the pooping.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.138
I want a dog.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.923
How 'bout we start you off
with something easier?

08:09.053 --> 08:10.141
Like a pet rock?

08:10.272 --> 08:12.013
-How 'bout a cat?
-Sea monkeys.

08:12.143 --> 08:12.883
-Gerbil.
-Ant farm.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.276
-Fish.
-Deal.

08:14.406 --> 08:16.757
Tough negotiation, Dad.

08:16.887 --> 08:20.282
Normally, you just cave
into a fetal ball.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.066
Pleasure doing business.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.242
I don't suppose you'd like
to take a brief survey?

08:24.373 --> 08:25.635
Click.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.554
Carly!

08:32.816 --> 08:33.904
How are you?

08:34.035 --> 08:36.864
I'm good. You?

08:36.994 --> 08:38.735
I hear you saying you're good,

08:38.866 --> 08:41.085
but I still need to acknowledge
the cruelty of my actions.

08:41.216 --> 08:44.698
I never should've accused you
of caring too much.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.438
If anything,
I should've accused you

08:46.569 --> 08:48.310
of being
just so gosh darn wonderful.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.487
-Come here.
-Aw.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.010
Thank you.

08:53.141 --> 08:56.057
-I just like to help my friends.
-Mm.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.363
Don't really need a hug

08:58.494 --> 09:01.192
to still be happening.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.412
Everybody needs a hug.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.547
And if it's a convenient time,
I got you this gift.

09:11.942 --> 09:14.336
It's a menstrual crystal.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.468
Oh.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.993
Thank you.
[chuckles]

09:19.123 --> 09:21.648
But, you know,
I was just saying that stuff

09:21.778 --> 09:23.345
about the book to mess with you.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.175
I misunderstood your joke.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.873
And for that, I apologize.

09:30.004 --> 09:32.963
Wow. That Sensitivity Sand
really works.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.663
[high-pitched]:
Do you not want it?!

09:36.793 --> 09:39.840
Oh. No, it's...

09:39.970 --> 09:41.363
It's great.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.191
Thank you, Carly.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.584
If you hadn't have meddled,

09:44.714 --> 09:46.237
I never would have found
Sensitivity Sand.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.674
And then where would I be?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.285
[voice breaking]:
Lost.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.156
That's where.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.246
I feel that it's best

09:55.377 --> 09:58.423
you process these emotions
on your own.

10:00.556 --> 10:04.125
[sighs]
You know who else needs a hug?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.524
[elevator dings]

10:14.570 --> 10:16.093
Freddie?

10:16.224 --> 10:17.486
Over here.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.183
-What is all this?
-[grunts]

10:19.314 --> 10:22.360
You said I needed a side hustle.
I'm side-hustling.

10:22.491 --> 10:26.538
Say hello
to the latest Sandbassador.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.716
-Wow, that's amazing. Congrats.
-Yeah.

10:29.846 --> 10:33.328
-But they just gave you
all this inventory? -Yeah,

10:33.458 --> 10:35.809
once I gave them $4,000,

10:35.939 --> 10:38.072
which was an amazing discount.

10:38.202 --> 10:41.510
But wasn't that
all the money you saved

10:41.641 --> 10:44.382
so that you could move out
and get your own apartment?

10:44.513 --> 10:47.255
Nah, Griffin says I'll
make my money back super fast.

10:47.385 --> 10:49.953
And then Millicent and I
will be out of Mom's apartment.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.303
I already joined the waitlist
to use the rooftop Peloton.

10:52.434 --> 10:55.263
Mondays at 3:00 a.m.,
here I come.

10:55.393 --> 10:58.048
What's the problem?
You love Sand.

10:58.179 --> 11:01.008
Yeah, but I just thought
you'd start small

11:01.138 --> 11:02.792
and work your way up.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.315
Freddie, spending all your money

11:04.446 --> 11:06.143
-is a huge risk.
-Eh.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.145
I'd be really, really worried
for you now

11:08.276 --> 11:11.148
-if I wasn't all hopped up
on Calm Sand. -[chuckles]

11:12.193 --> 11:14.064
Thank you, Carly.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.893
I am standing on the precipice
of total success

11:17.024 --> 11:18.416
or absolute failure,

11:18.547 --> 11:20.288
and you're pushing me
over the cliff.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.569
Harper, I have a huge prob...

11:40.700 --> 11:42.310
Whoa.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.400
You're dressed as a normie.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.793
Look away.

11:48.359 --> 11:50.666
The pain of this polycotton
blend against my skin

11:50.797 --> 11:54.104
is a direct reflection
of the pain I feel inside.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.498
I'm really sorry. But your pain,

11:56.628 --> 11:59.631
like that shirt,
will shrink and fade.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.113
I promise.
You'll have other opportunities.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.898
Yeah,
other opportunities to fail.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.334
This shirt is a lie!

12:06.464 --> 12:08.945
[whispers]:
And it's from an outlet.

12:09.076 --> 12:12.209
Well,
things could always be worse.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.297
I hate when people
try to cheer you up

12:13.428 --> 12:14.821
by saying,
"Things could be worse."

12:14.951 --> 12:16.431
Unless you know
a specific person

12:16.561 --> 12:19.477
for whom things are worse,
in which case, dish.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.044
It's Freddie.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.655
Aw, poor guy.
Tell me everything.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.746
I can feel
my emotional healing already.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.051
I told him to get a side hustle,

12:28.182 --> 12:30.967
and he spent his life savings
on Sand.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.534
What if he can't sell it
and he gets stuck

12:32.664 --> 12:35.102
with his mom forever,
and it's all my fault?

12:35.232 --> 12:38.061
-Yeah. That's the good stuff.
-Wait.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.107
I can help him sell it.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.543
I have
three million subscribers,

12:41.673 --> 12:43.284
and Sand is amazing.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.286
The day is saved.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.984
I'm going back
to my neck massager.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.858
"The creature revealed itself
in the moonlight.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.164
A dragon
ten times the boy's size."

12:54.295 --> 12:57.864
A dragon
is like a giant land fish,

12:57.994 --> 13:00.170
but not as cool as you, Donut.

13:00.301 --> 13:02.303
Now that we have
your laptop sorted,

13:02.433 --> 13:05.001
can I interest you
in a supplement to... Hello?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.832
Look, Millicent, it's great

13:09.963 --> 13:12.356
that you're spending
so much time with your new pet.

13:12.487 --> 13:16.534
Um, excuse you?
Donut is my daughter.

13:16.665 --> 13:19.668
Just don't forget about
your homework and your chores.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.019
Oh, I'll juggle it all.
Like working moms everywhere.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.195
Hey.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.936
How's it going with the Sand?

13:27.067 --> 13:28.720
Great! Sold a case to Spencer.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.592
That's a start. Anyone else?

13:30.722 --> 13:32.724
Uh, not yet. You know,
mostly just putting out feelers.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.378
Getting the word out. Branding.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.032
Begging.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.426
He made me text my bus driver.

13:39.688 --> 13:40.820
Well, beg no more.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.865
We're gonna sell Sand on iCarly.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.346
No, stop, I'm no hero.

13:45.476 --> 13:48.697
That seems like I'd be expanding
to a much bigger market.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.265
Yeah! It'll be great.
We can even have testimonials

13:51.395 --> 13:53.571
from you and me and Spencer

13:53.702 --> 13:55.530
if he ever stops crying
in the bath.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.749
We'll make your money back
in no time.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.316
Okay, sure.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.275
You know, I'll order more Sand
so I'm ready.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.973
Wait, I-I just meant
to sell what you already have.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.670
You know what's really brave?

14:05.801 --> 14:07.498
Playing it safe.

14:07.629 --> 14:08.978
No, you're right.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.937
Expanding
is totally the right call.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.417
Hey, Mom! I need a loan!

14:15.376 --> 14:17.726
Well, there goes
your college fund, Donut.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.120
She's getting a scholarship.

14:24.646 --> 14:25.952
Yeah. A sales chart,

14:26.082 --> 14:28.780
people calling in--
the whole QVC shebang.

14:28.911 --> 14:29.999
We'll even do testimonials.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.740
I'll do my classic owl speech.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.524
Do you think you could cry?

14:33.655 --> 14:35.222
Oh, no problem.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.528
[voice breaking]:
This stuff is like Pixar.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.835
Harper, you sure
I can't offer you some Sand?

14:39.966 --> 14:42.838
They have one
for Gen Z-level confidence.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.057
Nothing's gonna cheer me up.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.841
Especially
when everyone else's life

14:45.972 --> 14:48.322
is going so perfectly.

14:48.452 --> 14:52.804
I just made
VIP Diamond Salesperson

14:52.935 --> 14:55.546
for North Seattle District.
Can you believe it?

14:55.677 --> 14:58.114
VIPDS for NSD!

14:58.245 --> 15:00.595
Plus, I got
this awesome Sand Scooter.

15:00.725 --> 15:03.424
This is not fun for me.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.382
I thought
you only sold one case.

15:05.513 --> 15:08.864
I did. But that netted me
50,000 bonus Sand Coins,

15:08.995 --> 15:11.780
which I used to buy more Sand.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.000
Oh, I'm gonna be rich.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.176
Which is why I quit my job.

15:16.306 --> 15:19.701
You quit your job?
You can't quit.

15:19.831 --> 15:22.791
You have a daughter to support
and a mother to placate.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.099
Brave Sand Freddie
leaps without a net, baby!

15:26.229 --> 15:30.233
I am so ready for this iCarly
Sand-sational Sales event!

15:30.364 --> 15:32.409
[whoops]

15:32.540 --> 15:35.673
Today, he has wheels.
Tomorrow, he'll fly.

15:35.804 --> 15:38.241
Yeah, fly into debt.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.504
It took me a minute
to figure it out,

15:40.635 --> 15:41.941
but Sand is shady.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.507
It's an MLM.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.682
Nuh-uh.

15:44.813 --> 15:47.120
What is that?

15:47.250 --> 15:49.122
Multilevel marketing.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.775
It's a pyramid scheme.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.474
Companies get you to buy
inventory of phony products

15:53.604 --> 15:55.737
that you can't sell
'cause they don't work,

15:55.867 --> 15:58.740
so your only way out
is to recruit more salespeople.

15:58.870 --> 16:01.177
I learned all about it
on my favorite podcast,

16:01.308 --> 16:03.136
Scam Empress.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.007
That's not what's going on here.

16:05.138 --> 16:08.619
Hmm. They keep sellers
interested with cheap prizes,

16:08.750 --> 16:11.883
fancy titles
and worthless fake currency.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.582
Check, check and ch-check.

16:14.712 --> 16:17.977
You said MLM products are bogus,
but Sand works.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.544
I'm calm, Spencer's sensitive,

16:20.675 --> 16:24.200
and Freddie's so brave
he inadvisably quit his job.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.550
Now, if you'll just excuse me,

16:26.681 --> 16:29.510
I have a Sand-sational
Sales event to prepare for.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.339
I've got my head in the Sand,
and it's staying there.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.258
They make baby carriers
for goldfish?

16:38.388 --> 16:39.737
They make everything on Etsy.

16:39.868 --> 16:43.219
Clearly,
you didn't check my registry.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.701
I don't believe in registries.
No one tells me how to shop.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.356
Well, I'll take
a black coffee for myself

16:49.486 --> 16:51.358
and a seaweed tea for her.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.055
[laughs]
I'll give you an apple juice

16:53.186 --> 16:56.841
and a pass on our zero-tolerance
policy for non-service animals.

16:56.972 --> 17:00.149
Fine. I'll feed her myself.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.194
What are you doing here, anyway?

17:01.324 --> 17:03.370
I'm here
for my Fishy and Me group.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.894
I love Donut,
but it's nice to connect

17:06.025 --> 17:07.461
with other parents.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.767
I need something just for me.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.595
That's fair.

17:12.596 --> 17:15.730
Oh, my God!
I think I killed my baby.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.820
Why did I ever do anything
just for me?

17:18.950 --> 17:20.256
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened?

17:20.387 --> 17:22.867
I fed Donut this dumb Brave Sand

17:22.998 --> 17:24.217
instead of fish food!

17:24.347 --> 17:25.957
How did I mix these up?

17:26.088 --> 17:27.742
Because they look identical.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.439
Put out your hands.

17:32.007 --> 17:35.315
They're the exact same.

17:37.012 --> 17:40.320
Brave Sand is fish food!

17:44.976 --> 17:46.369
I was right. It's a scam.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.632
Carly and Freddie
are about to go on her show

17:48.763 --> 17:50.069
and sell this junk
to her subscribers.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.505
I have to warn them.

17:51.635 --> 17:54.290
-Oh.
-Hey, Harpsichord.

17:54.421 --> 17:57.032
Hey, CJ-piano.

17:57.163 --> 18:00.862
Listen, I have an MLM/friendship
emergency, so I got to go.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.169
As your friend, I say,
"We've all been there."

18:03.299 --> 18:04.779
But as your assistant manager,
I say,

18:04.909 --> 18:07.738
"Employees must complete
their shifts as scheduled."

18:07.869 --> 18:09.392
But I covered for you

18:09.523 --> 18:11.699
when you had to chaperone
your dog's honeymoon.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.527
As your friend,
La Roux, Cookie and I

18:13.657 --> 18:15.311
will never forget
your generosity.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.487
But as your assistant manager,
you...

18:17.618 --> 18:19.707
Let me stop you right there.

18:19.837 --> 18:22.449
This job is holding me back
in all types of ways.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.451
So, as your employee, I say,

18:24.581 --> 18:26.279
"I quit."

18:33.199 --> 18:36.506
But as your friend, I say,
"Drinks this weekend?"

18:36.637 --> 18:38.595
All right.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.817
Everyone get ready for a...

19:16.633 --> 19:19.723
Thank you
for letting me speak my truth.

Before Sand, I listened,
but I didn't hear.

19:24.859 --> 19:27.470
I heard,
but I didn't understand.

19:27.601 --> 19:30.430
I understood,
but I pretended not to

19:30.560 --> 19:33.433
so I didn't have to give
the Greenpeace guy my email.

19:33.563 --> 19:36.784
With Sensitivity Sand,
all that has changed.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.221

know and trust...

20:04.594 --> 20:06.727
"Sand is fish food"?

20:06.857 --> 20:09.295
-[mouths]
-...Carly Shay!

20:09.425 --> 20:12.385
[whoops]

20:12.515 --> 20:15.126
All right, help us out.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.606
Sell that Sand, Carly.

20:16.737 --> 20:19.522
Uh-huh.
[chuckles] Yeah.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.656
Calm Sand keeps me very calm.

20:22.786 --> 20:25.789
Like a snowy owl on the tundra,

20:25.920 --> 20:28.488
starving for a mouse.

20:28.618 --> 20:31.665
But what if you only think
it's a mouse, so you down it,

20:31.795 --> 20:33.754
and then you find out
it's fish food?

20:33.884 --> 20:35.843
Do you think
that the owl is a fraud

20:35.973 --> 20:37.932
even though she didn't know?

20:38.062 --> 20:39.412
[panting]
Oh, my God.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.587
I think I'm gonna throw up.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.719
[laughs]
Carly's trying to show us

20:42.850 --> 20:45.287
what she was like
before Calm Sand.

20:45.418 --> 20:46.984
Here, Carly.

20:47.115 --> 20:48.943
Why don't you take
a nice big drink?

20:49.073 --> 20:51.075
"Hoo, hoo," right?

20:51.206 --> 20:52.860
Chug! Chug! Chug!

20:52.990 --> 20:54.427
-Chug!
-I can't drink this.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.820
-Why not?
-'Cause Sand is fish food.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.387
What?!

20:58.518 --> 20:59.997
It's not brimming
with antioxidants.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.782
It's brimming with fish food.

21:01.912 --> 21:04.132
Oh, my God. Sand is fish food?!

21:04.263 --> 21:06.874
No. It has not been legally
proven to be food of any kind.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.007
What?!

21:10.138 --> 21:11.226
You knew?

21:12.227 --> 21:14.185
Wait, that's why
you wanted to meet up,

21:14.316 --> 21:16.187
so you could sell me this junk.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.233
Not to get back together.

21:18.364 --> 21:21.192
Yes. N-No. Well, maybe. Um...

21:21.323 --> 21:23.107
We can get back together.

21:23.238 --> 21:24.892
Carly, I love you.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.633
Ew.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.635
I never even considered it
for one second.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.333
Freddie, are you okay?

21:31.464 --> 21:33.466
[laughs]

21:33.596 --> 21:34.989
If Sand is fake,

21:35.119 --> 21:37.470
then I stood up to Millicent
all on my own.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.123
I really am brave.

21:39.254 --> 21:42.475
So I can totally handle the fact
that I just quit my job.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.912
And spent all my money. And...

21:45.042 --> 21:47.044
Oh, wow, okay.
Well, I'm sweating a lot.

21:47.175 --> 21:50.047
Probably just
from the excitement and bravery.

21:50.178 --> 21:52.615
What have I done?

21:52.746 --> 21:55.052
You know what product
I can always rely on?

21:55.183 --> 21:56.576
A can of whup-ass.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.578
Scooter exit.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.364
I can't believe it.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.279
I can see that you're hurting,

22:04.410 --> 22:06.847
-and I feel your pain.
-No, dude, stop.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.370
Sensitivity Sand is fake.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.111
Yeah.

22:10.241 --> 22:12.374
Which means
I've always been this sensitive.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.985
Wow, am I
the absolute total package?

22:16.204 --> 22:19.425
Freddie, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have meddled.

22:19.555 --> 22:22.123
You quit your job.
You're a fish owner now.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.952
No, it's okay.
That job was holding me back.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.910
Look, Sand was a scam,

22:27.041 --> 22:29.522
but this experience reminded me
I'm an entrepreneur.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.045
I need to start
pursuing that again.

22:31.175 --> 22:34.091
Even if it'll take
a lot of bravery.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.659
Well, I quit my job today, too.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.444
-You did?
-Yeah.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.924
Oh, well, now I feel great!
Everything you do is cool.

22:41.055 --> 22:42.578
Fun-employment dance.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.755
[both vocalizing]

22:47.801 --> 22:49.411
And then I threw my apron down

22:49.542 --> 22:50.934
in a very cool
and not embarrassing way,

22:51.065 --> 22:54.416
and I said,
"CJ, you can't stop my dreams."

22:54.547 --> 22:56.200
And then I stormed out

22:56.331 --> 22:58.551
as the crowd of customers
cheered.

22:58.681 --> 23:01.292
Millicent
told a different story.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.555
You know she be lying.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.034
[door opens]

23:04.165 --> 23:05.558
Spencer, I keep telling you,

23:05.688 --> 23:07.516
-I don't want to hug it out.
-Bep-bep-bep!

23:07.647 --> 23:09.344
Shut up.

23:11.564 --> 23:15.219
Oh! How are you feeling
now that you're unemployed?

23:15.350 --> 23:17.308
Fantastic. Like there's
a world of opportunity

23:17.439 --> 23:18.788
in front of me. You?

23:18.919 --> 23:20.355
Absolute same.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.009
[both laugh]

23:22.139 --> 23:23.706
Full of doom and peril.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.316
Like every decision
I've ever made was a mistake.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.014
-Hide under a blanket?
-You read my mind.
