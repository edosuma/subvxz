00:06.089 --> 00:10.802
[André]
...seven, eight, nine, ten. Here I come!

00:12.846 --> 00:14.348
Michele?

00:16.140 --> 00:18.519
Michele, where are you hiding?

00:18.602 --> 00:21.230
You must be really well-hidden,
because I can't--

00:21.313 --> 00:22.898
-[screams]
-[laughs]

00:23.857 --> 00:25.901
-Stop, André! Stop!
-What now?

00:25.984 --> 00:27.653
[both laughing]

00:27.736 --> 00:28.904
[Michele] Now it's my turn!

00:30.781 --> 00:36.495
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.249
André?

00:47.172 --> 00:48.298
André?

00:50.175 --> 00:51.551
André, where are you?

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.278 --> 01:10.779
André?

01:19.538 --> 01:20.372
[gasps]

01:22.207 --> 01:23.166
Are you okay?

01:29.715 --> 01:32.801
I'm fine. It was just a nightmare.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.155
How did you know?

01:55.532 --> 01:56.950
How did I know what?

01:57.034 --> 01:59.911
Don't play dumb.
[softly] I'm with the Cause.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.664
I saw a picture of you.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.251
I know I shouldn't have,

02:06.335 --> 02:10.005
but I was going through some stuff
in the shelter and I saw the picture.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.507
-It was very useful.
-You should've stayed anonymous.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.551
I know, but it was an emergency.

02:15.802 --> 02:19.139
I would've died if you hadn't
let me through the barricade.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.521
-Did you by any chance tell him?
-Of course not!

02:29.983 --> 02:32.694
Our contact here
is totally against protocol.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.659
Forget what you saw and I'll do the same.

02:47.834 --> 02:52.714
Okay, candidates. From now on,
each of you will get your own room.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.591
Follow me.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.677
[low murmurs]

04:05.704 --> 04:06.788
Dad!

04:07.748 --> 04:08.957
Dad...

04:37.778 --> 04:41.740
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

04:41.823 --> 04:44.326
[theme music playing]

05:37.003 --> 05:39.339
CHAPTER 06
GLASS

05:40.674 --> 05:43.176
This held up pretty well, son.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.722
You haven't made it through yet,

05:47.806 --> 05:50.976
and you're already better off
than anyone in the Inland.

05:51.059 --> 05:55.897
This is a new room.
It's pretty, but it's just for show.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.484
Do you know what the Founders
of the Offshore went through

05:59.568 --> 06:02.862
without the least bit of comfort,
safety...?

06:02.946 --> 06:06.616
I get it. They brought you here
to encourage me to pass the Process,

06:06.700 --> 06:09.119
-so I can have a better life--
-No, son.

06:09.202 --> 06:14.833
It's a test. They bring in the relatives
to convince the candidates to give up.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.210
And they offer that as temptation.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.800
That's a lot of money, Dad.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.220
We could renovate our house,
or build a new one.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.395
[knock on door]

06:39.316 --> 06:42.152
Since you don't have any family,
I came here to explain.

06:42.861 --> 06:43.862
Explain what?

06:43.945 --> 06:47.741
Each candidate has 30 minutes to decide
whether they want to take the money

06:47.824 --> 06:50.869
and return to the Inland
or continue in the Process with nothing.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.456
You have 30 minutes to think about it.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.544
[door shuts]

07:05.967 --> 07:07.552
[muffled grunting]

07:08.845 --> 07:11.306
[man] Shh... Shh!

07:20.774 --> 07:23.318
[Nair]
<i>Ezequiel? I have news, my friend.</i>

07:24.611 --> 07:27.656
-Hi, Nair.
<i>-Aline just sent in her report.</i>

07:27.739 --> 07:30.700
<i>I don't know what you did and,</i>
<i>frankly, I don't care.</i>

07:30.784 --> 07:33.954
<i>But whatever it was, it worked.</i>
<i>It was all compliments.</i>

07:34.037 --> 07:37.540
<i>She said your measures</i>
<i>are appropriate, moderate...</i>

07:37.624 --> 07:40.835
<i>Do you understand what that means?</i>

07:40.919 --> 07:42.003
Yes, of course.

07:42.087 --> 07:46.174
Her evaluation was so good, the only way
I'll leave is if I voluntarily resign.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.803
<i>Did I call at a bad time?</i>

07:51.054 --> 07:55.308
No. I'm just in the middle of a test
and finishing some candidate profiles.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.267
[clears throat]

07:56.351 --> 07:59.020
-Can I contact you in a bit?
<i>-Sure.</i>

07:59.104 --> 08:02.148
Uh, very good news. Very good, indeed.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.525
We got rid of that problem.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.204
[André] Here I come.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.748
Michele?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.924
[screams]

08:28.008 --> 08:30.010
[Ezequiel]
<i>You shouldn't have seen this.</i>

08:35.347 --> 08:36.640
I found you!

08:38.727 --> 08:40.602
[voices echoing]

09:06.880 --> 09:08.965
Do you know who I am? Do you?!

09:10.592 --> 09:12.260
I came here to take you to Gerson.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.556
You murdered his son.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.894
I got in by pretending I was your father.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.022
I just didn't expect to find this.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.400
The money the Process
is offering you to quit

09:27.484 --> 09:29.861
is more than what Gerson's
offering for your head.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.989
So, I have a choice to make.
Option one:

09:33.740 --> 09:37.660
I kill you right now
and take a picture of the body.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.914
By the time they find you,
I'll be at Gerson's getting my money.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.209
Option two:

09:44.876 --> 09:47.045
You walk out of here holding my hand.

09:47.128 --> 09:50.840
Like Daddy's little girl.
And I get double the cash.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.556
Isn't that what you wanted?
To get your life back?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.816
This will be a great help.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.567
-Mom--
-Your plan worked.

10:11.903 --> 10:15.907
You should see how proud
your brothers are.

10:15.990 --> 10:20.453
Especially your little brother, Rafael.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.792
Mom, I'm not going back.
I'm staying in the Process.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.633
Let's talk about this.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.347
-Stop being so stubborn.
-I didn't come for the money.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.891
But that's why you're gonna quit.
It's for your family.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.644
Don't you understand?
You don't need money.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.563
How do you know what we need?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.858
After everything you did to your brother?
Your betrayal?

10:49.941 --> 10:51.651
What do you really know, Tiago?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.406
[sighs] You know...

10:57.782 --> 11:01.661
I dreamed that I didn't
make it through the Process--

11:01.744 --> 11:05.290
-Don't even say that.
-I've seen things in here, Dad.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.667
People have died, Dad.

11:08.877 --> 11:13.256
People like me who worked hard for
the chance to make it through the Process.

11:14.465 --> 11:19.220
This Process is not fair. Trust me.
Maybe we should take the money--

11:19.304 --> 11:20.430
I don't understand you.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.309
This doesn't sound like you.
You sound more like a Cause rebel.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.687
Look how much money that is!
You wouldn't have to preach every day--

11:27.770 --> 11:31.190
Just the opposite! Especially if my son
is a skeptic from the Cause

11:31.274 --> 11:32.400
who quit the Process!

11:32.483 --> 11:34.777
-You are not listening.
-What matters most?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.946
-I'm not saying--
-What matters the most?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.699
Tell me! What matters the most?

11:39.782 --> 11:40.658
[sighs]

11:42.327 --> 11:46.539
Passing the Process, son!
Passing the Process.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.876
You've known that
since the day you were born.

11:49.959 --> 11:50.835
No!

11:52.170 --> 11:54.005
That's your dream, Dad!

11:54.088 --> 11:58.051
It used to be mine too, but now that
I'm here, I know it's not anymore.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.428
[Fernando sighs]

12:03.765 --> 12:04.974
[door opens]

12:08.269 --> 12:11.606
It was an accident. I didn't take
a single coin. You can count them.

12:11.689 --> 12:16.819
Relax. They have no value
on the Offshore. We don't use money.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.114
Have you made your decision?

12:20.740 --> 12:21.574
I'm staying.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.541
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

12:32.919 --> 12:34.170
[water running]

12:34.254 --> 12:35.380
I've made up my mind.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.090
I came here to pass.

12:37.966 --> 12:41.511
And I'll do that because I want
a better world for my children.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.346
You know nothing about children.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.975
And when you find out,
you will see that a family needs money.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.894
No, Mom! You don't know!
You had tons of kids for what?

12:49.978 --> 12:53.064
-I've done everything for you.
-No, you haven't. You haven't.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.402
I'm going to pass, Mom.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.363
I will do it so I can change things.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.533
Forget about the money.

13:04.617 --> 13:09.247
Imagine what they would do
if they found out you're not Rafael.

13:10.999 --> 13:15.294
That you are here trying to pass
the Process for the second time.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.966
You wouldn't do that to your own son.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.218
Not to a good son.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.139
I would never do that to my Rafael.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.266
But to you, I will.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.732
I'm glad you reconsidered, son.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.280
If you turn me in,
I'll say it was your idea.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.367
That you knew, the whole family knew.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.913
Your children would all be banned
from the Process.

13:52.874 --> 13:56.669
-You wouldn't do that to your own mother.
-Not to a good mother.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.088
But to you, I'd do it in a heartbeat.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.350
Mom, what are you doing? Mom!

14:18.775 --> 14:22.653
Take a close look at Rafael!
He is not who you think he is!

14:23.905 --> 14:25.114
He's a traitor!

14:34.957 --> 14:36.876
He betrayed his own family.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.836
My mind is made up.
There's no reason to wait.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.546
I won't let you quit.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.756
-I want to quit!
-Did you forget your condition?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.592
My condition hasn't changed.
This is who I am.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.929
Where is this pride coming from?
I carried you all the way here.

15:31.597 --> 15:36.269
Don't you want to walk again, son?
Or do you want to sit there forever?

15:36.352 --> 15:39.230
You! You always said
I was like everyone else.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.566
As long as you have
a chance of passing, yes!

15:41.649 --> 15:43.818
As long as you can be cured, yes!

15:44.944 --> 15:47.864
But if you want to sit
in that chair forever...

15:56.539 --> 15:58.374
I will always pray for you.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.255
May you be happy and healthy...

16:05.548 --> 16:06.466
on the Offshore.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.098
If you choose to come back,
you'll be on your own.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.073
My son will remain in the Process.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.325
Very well.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.425
Time's almost up, Joana.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.096
Option two, "Daddy."

16:55.139 --> 16:57.642
Good choice.
You'll have everything you ever wanted.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.268
Now let's get out of here.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.901
-The Founders would be proud-- [grunts]
-[shrieks]

17:08.903 --> 17:09.945
[man groans]

17:15.201 --> 17:16.618
[Joana grunts]

17:21.832 --> 17:24.167
[grunting, gasping]

17:28.297 --> 17:32.718
Go ahead and kill me! Fuck it!
I want to go to the Offshore!

17:36.889 --> 17:39.600
Congratulations, then. You passed.

17:40.810 --> 17:41.811
What the fuck is this?

17:43.604 --> 17:44.730
My name is Jairo.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.482
Ezequiel sent me.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.613
We know who you are. For real.

17:53.364 --> 17:55.658
He wanted to make sure
you really wanted to pass.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.119
That you weren't using the Process
just to get away.

17:58.995 --> 18:03.833
And if you really want to pass, for us...
you really are Joana.

18:06.377 --> 18:07.253
So I passed?

18:09.964 --> 18:12.258
Yes, Joana. You passed.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.163
-[soft rattling nearby]
-I...

18:44.457 --> 18:45.708
I came here...

18:47.001 --> 18:49.003
to say goodbye.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.474
You'll have to take care of yourself
from now on.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.518
[Augusto] I don't want to.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.147
Being on your own will be good for you.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.275
It will make you strong.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.945
You will grow up, be strong.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.907
You will pass.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.352
[Ezequiel] No.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.487
[water dripping]

19:58.030 --> 19:59.782
[knocking on door]

20:02.952 --> 20:04.662
[knocking continues]

20:04.745 --> 20:06.372
[Cássia]
Ezequiel, I know you're there.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.064
You're acting strangely.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.152
-Aline...
-What about her?

20:36.819 --> 20:38.070
She wants to take my place.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.074
But... that's not really a surprise,
is it?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.702
[sighs, mutters indistinctly]

20:45.911 --> 20:48.956
She's blackmailing me, Cássia.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.125
-You have to report her.
-I can't.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.170
Why not? May I ask what she has on you?

20:55.546 --> 20:56.797
It's best if you don't.

20:57.965 --> 21:02.011
That makes it hard to come up
with a strategy to neutralize her.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.765
You don't think I've considered
all possibilities already?

21:06.474 --> 21:07.767
Ezequiel...

21:09.643 --> 21:10.770
I'm on your side.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.439
I always have been.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.779
Now, to get the other agents on your side,
you have to pull it together.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.117
The summit meeting is in 30 minutes.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.999
[door slides open]

21:33.459 --> 21:34.960
[door slides shut]

21:36.962 --> 21:42.384
Remaining candidates, from now on,
you will be summoned one by one.

21:47.932 --> 21:48.766
[door opens]

21:53.938 --> 21:56.232
What happened? Was that your father?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.359
He made me stay in the Process.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.028
He told me if I didn't pass,
I wouldn't have a home anymore.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.784
What about you? Who came for you?

22:09.787 --> 22:10.913
I don't have any family.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.542
I was raised by my brother.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.925
You are the best thing
that's happened to me in this Process.

22:23.008 --> 22:26.845
In fact, the only good thing.
I know what I want, and that's you.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.889
I'll go wherever you go.
It doesn't matter where.

22:28.973 --> 22:32.101
-Fernando, no--
-No, I'm serious. I'm serious.

22:32.935 --> 22:36.814
I don't care about passing the Process
as long as we end up on the same side.

23:18.063 --> 23:21.692
[inhales deeply, exhales]

23:49.678 --> 23:52.806
Let's begin. First candidate.

23:52.890 --> 23:53.891
[Luciana] Joana.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.434
Joana is done. Next.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.395
Done, why? Anyone care to explain?

23:59.104 --> 24:02.316
Her individual test was applied
instead of the parents' visit.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.653
Jairo did a variation of the Quitting test
and she passed.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.031
May we continue? Michele.

24:09.114 --> 24:14.703
Candidate Michele has leadership skills,
social presence and lots of awareness.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.998
She rarely shows her true emotions.
Like with that other candidate,

24:18.082 --> 24:20.084
what's his name,
the one in a wheelchair.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.879
Fernando. Yes. The dynamic
between them is basically unilateral.

24:23.963 --> 24:27.841
Wasn't she the one who witnessed
the execution of the Cause infiltrator?

24:28.425 --> 24:30.636
Bruna? Perhaps that's the reason.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.097
We can't be sure.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.432
-We need a comprehensive test.
-[Ezequiel] Mm-hm.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.143
I suggest a hybrid test.
Family News with Recruitment.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.190
Good idea, Aline. Next.

24:44.858 --> 24:45.693
[Luciana] Rafael.

24:45.776 --> 24:48.320
The candidate who stole the cube
and Ezequiel let through.

24:48.404 --> 24:52.866
I suggest a Dependency test to check
this candidate's level of vulnerability.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.331
Denise will run the test.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.553
I enjoyed this place during my Process.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.389
Are you ready for your individual test?

25:23.605 --> 25:25.149
[knocking on door]

25:25.899 --> 25:28.485
[man] Michele, your individual test
is about to begin.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.713
If you pass, I'll pass.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.718
We'll make it through together.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.471
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

26:01.560 --> 26:03.145
There's a couple in the next room.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.814
They have a ten-year-old daughter.
You must convince them

26:05.898 --> 26:08.275
to sign her up for the Process
when the time comes.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.361
-That's it?
-That's it.

26:24.041 --> 26:28.295
You! You're friends with Bruna,
aren't you?

26:29.088 --> 26:30.923
Michele, it's you.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.092
You look beautiful.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.637
I forgot to mention that their daughter
is Bruna's younger sister.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.807
You will have to tell them
that their daughter is dead.

26:40.557 --> 26:44.061
You passed?
You and Bruna passed, right?

26:46.188 --> 26:48.065
They said they had news.

26:49.066 --> 26:49.900
Um...

26:49.983 --> 26:52.444
You don't need to say
she was with the Cause.

26:52.528 --> 26:53.862
You can make something up.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.912
Unfortunately, I don't have good news.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.875
What happened? Is she hurt?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.711
[breathing deeply]

27:09.795 --> 27:11.380
[Bruna's father] Just say it, girl.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.050
Bruna passed away. I'm very sorry.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.262
Bruna?

27:19.972 --> 27:20.973
My daughter?

27:23.016 --> 27:24.351
What happened?

27:26.186 --> 27:30.607
It was an accident. She...
She knocked over a gas cylinder--

27:30.691 --> 27:32.776
What the hell was a cylinder doing there?

27:32.860 --> 27:35.904
-You killed my daughter!
-No! Bruna got lost.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.782
She walked into a room
that was off-limits.

27:38.866 --> 27:42.035
-So, it was her fault?
-No, it wasn't her fault.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.704
It was nobody's fault. It was an accident.

27:50.586 --> 27:51.753
Michele...

27:54.464 --> 27:56.592
[voice trembling]
Where is my daughter?

27:59.052 --> 28:01.471
I need to see my daughter.

28:19.364 --> 28:24.077
These are the records of all tests
ever conducted in the Process.

28:25.329 --> 28:29.249
Your test is to come up
with a new test for the Process.

28:29.333 --> 28:34.463
Even after all these years, we're trying
to make the Process more efficient,

28:34.546 --> 28:35.631
more fair.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.133
You have half an hour.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.774
It's a tradition to project images
of the Founding Couple

28:53.857 --> 28:56.443
to symbolize this time of celebration.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.237
The Foundress on this side...

29:00.072 --> 29:01.615
and the Founder over here.

29:02.658 --> 29:06.495
Your individual test is to trigger
both images at sunset,

29:06.578 --> 29:08.413
precisely at 6 p.m. tonight.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.666
No problem.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.125
Both images at the same time.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.294
One image can't upstage the other.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.755
Right, of course. What about the switch?

29:17.464 --> 29:20.968
The switch for one of the images
is located at the end of the south ramp.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.554
The other is at the end of the north ramp.

29:25.305 --> 29:28.100
Wait. You're asking me
to be in two places at the same time.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.103
Yes. But you're smarter than that.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.939
So, my individual test is not individual.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.441
Good luck getting anyone to help you.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.444
-Good luck.
-Sure.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.253
Hey! Uh...

29:56.336 --> 29:58.380
Buddy! Yeah, you there!

29:59.298 --> 30:01.591
I need a favor, real quick!

30:01.675 --> 30:02.509
Hey, I--

30:02.592 --> 30:03.844
Are you kidding me?

30:04.469 --> 30:05.470
No. Why?

30:05.554 --> 30:08.098
Did you forget what you did to me
in the dorms?

30:08.181 --> 30:11.184
That was a misunderstanding.
I didn't mean to do that.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.686
Well, I've been eliminated.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.814
So, you can go fuck yourself.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.406
-[mother sobs softly]
-[father] Calm down.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.365
Calm down.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.536
It'll be okay. Easy.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.622
The clock is ticking, Michele.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.253
You must understand,

30:38.337 --> 30:41.757
over 1,000 candidates
apply to the Process every year.

30:41.840 --> 30:47.721
It's a very complex system,
so accidents like this do happen.

30:48.555 --> 30:52.976
I am here to apologize...
on behalf of the Process.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.396
-Let's get out of here.
-If they leave, you are eliminated.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.857
No, please, wait!
You can't give up like this.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.108
There's still hope.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.862
Isabella, your youngest daughter,
she still has a chance.

31:03.945 --> 31:06.073
-You bitch!
-She can have a better life!

31:06.156 --> 31:07.282
-Calm down!
-Out of my way!

31:07.366 --> 31:11.495
You're not thinking straight!
The Process is her only chance!

31:11.578 --> 31:13.872
-Shut up!
-I know how you're feeling.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.750
-You know nothing!
-I do! My brother died in the Process.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.422
He was murdered in here.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.058
Your time is up.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.143
Come on.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.729
Tell me about your test.

31:37.813 --> 31:42.901
To start, not all candidates are truly
motivated to go to the Offshore.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.278
Unlike me. I need to pass...

31:46.488 --> 31:47.906
because of the wheelchair.

31:47.989 --> 31:51.827
For that reason, I suggest a change
in the Quitting test we had today.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.995
Didn't you enjoy the test
with your father?

31:54.079 --> 31:58.291
That's not it. It's a cynical test.
It's impure, based on money.

31:58.375 --> 32:01.461
What if the candidate wasn't aware
they were being tested?

32:01.920 --> 32:06.550
An agent tells him a story in private,
a lie that appeals to his emotional side.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.759
For example:

32:08.427 --> 32:12.681
"Your father is dying.
It's your last chance to see him alive."

32:13.265 --> 32:18.895
Candidates who decide to quit so they
can address the issue will be eliminated.

32:20.188 --> 32:24.234
One thing that concerns me is that
you chose to adapt an existing test,

32:24.317 --> 32:26.486
rather than creating a new one
as I had requested.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.113
But I only had half an hour.

32:28.196 --> 32:31.283
That's not enough time
to research the old tests.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.076
You've probably considered that.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.580
What matters is that
we improve things gradually.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.959
Let's consider a hypothetical situation.

32:41.877 --> 32:46.006
Suppose someone walked in here today
and said your father was on his deathbed.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.216
Would you quit the Process?

32:52.345 --> 32:55.640
I would not quit the Process
whether my father was sick or not.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.311
Your suggestion is good.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.022
It might work.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.149
You passed.

33:07.611 --> 33:08.570
Thank you.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.573
You deserve it.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.375
Joana!

33:34.930 --> 33:38.058
Joana! I really need your help!

33:38.141 --> 33:40.810
They fucked me over!
My individual test is not individual.

33:40.894 --> 33:44.397
I really need your help in order to pass.

33:45.815 --> 33:50.403
Fine, I'll help you. But only if you
tell me why you have a fake registration.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.698
What do you mean? So do you.

33:53.782 --> 33:58.119
Yes, I do. But the Process
knows about it and they forgave me.

33:58.203 --> 34:01.790
I've already finished my individual test,
Rafael. And I passed.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.460
Because I deserve it. Do you?

34:07.671 --> 34:10.297
I'll help you if your reason
is as forgivable as mine.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.092
Joana...

34:13.677 --> 34:15.679
I can't tell you. Please.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.933
Joana, please. Joana...

34:20.016 --> 34:22.978
Joana. Joana!

34:27.023 --> 34:27.857
Michele!

34:29.943 --> 34:31.194
Michele, I passed!

34:32.237 --> 34:34.447
-[knocking on door]
-Michele!

34:40.495 --> 34:45.375
Fernando... you passed.
Congrats. Really! [chuckles]

34:45.958 --> 34:50.170
Michele isn't here. I tried many times.
She's still taking her test.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.260
Fernando!

34:55.594 --> 34:57.387
-[opens door]
-Uh... Fernando.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.473
Fernando, let me talk to you, please.

35:01.016 --> 35:04.019
I need your help.
I need you so I can pass my test.

35:04.686 --> 35:08.148
-Good luck in the Inland.
-I know you are a good person.

35:08.231 --> 35:11.901
You're a good guy. You couldn't live
with the guilt of eliminating someone.

35:11.985 --> 35:12.861
Guilt?

35:12.944 --> 35:16.406
You cheated on the first test.
You tried to eliminate me.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.742
Even joined a gang that murdered people!

35:18.825 --> 35:22.662
Fernando...
if not for me, do it for Michele.

35:31.338 --> 35:34.758
Michele and I share the same goal.

35:35.842 --> 35:39.888
I know you have faith
and believe in the Process, but...

35:39.971 --> 35:43.600
not everyone thinks the same way.
Not everyone accepts it.

35:43.683 --> 35:48.480
Everything I've done, everything,
is because the world is messed up.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.231
This world is messed up!

35:51.274 --> 35:55.987
It's not fair that only three percent
of the population, three percent,

35:56.071 --> 36:01.284
enjoy a wonderful life on the Offshore
at the expense of everyone else.

36:01.951 --> 36:06.498
Some accept this injustice,
but others don't. Others fight.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.919
That's what I believe in. So does Michele.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.631
Are you saying you're both with the Cause?

36:20.637 --> 36:21.471
That can't be.

36:21.554 --> 36:24.724
What do you think I said to her
to get inside the barricade?

36:26.393 --> 36:28.687
-Michele is with me, Rafael.
-Yes.

36:29.145 --> 36:32.065
-The Cause is a criminal organization.
-Criminal?

36:32.148 --> 36:36.277
People with the Cause are the only ones
fighting for a better world,

36:36.361 --> 36:39.781
fighting to end this division,
because that is what's criminal.

36:41.324 --> 36:44.911
Or are you gonna say that you don't see
the harm this system brings

36:44.994 --> 36:46.162
to people's lives?

36:46.246 --> 36:51.334
I know you think I'm an idiot.
An asshole. Selfish, mean, whatever.

36:51.418 --> 36:55.922
But what you don't get
is that I did what I had to--

36:56.005 --> 36:57.799
-"Had to," my ass!
-I had to!

36:57.882 --> 37:01.803
I could have done nothing.
It would have been much easier.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.639
Get eliminated,
go back home and that's it.

37:05.765 --> 37:10.145
Am I sacrificing some along the way?
Yes, but to save everyone else.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.943
Do you realize the risk I'm taking here?

37:18.027 --> 37:22.157
If you turn me in, I'm dead.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.994
Not eliminated, Fernando. Dead.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.165
And Michele, too.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.759
My brother was a few years older than me.

37:42.510 --> 37:45.430
Our parents died when we were kids.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.516
So, he raised me.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.770
He was everything to me.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.524
Until the time came for him
to join the Process.

37:58.735 --> 38:03.156
He wanted to stay to take care of me,
but I told him he had to go.

38:06.743 --> 38:09.329
Three days later,
they told me he was dead.

38:12.624 --> 38:16.377
They said he cheated on a test.
It was a lie.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.838
A fight broke out and...

38:19.798 --> 38:22.801
an agent walked in and shot my brother.

38:25.053 --> 38:31.601
I spent five years hating this Process,
five years being angry, five years alone.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.439
Until my time came. [sniffling]

38:36.523 --> 38:37.899
When I got here...

38:38.900 --> 38:41.611
the first person I saw
was the man who killed my brother.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.244
And what did I do?

38:52.997 --> 38:54.541
I focused on the Process...

38:55.542 --> 38:56.459
and I passed.

38:58.419 --> 39:01.381
I don't regret it.
I know I made the right choice.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.384
And everything I did was for André.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.052
For him, in his memory.

39:09.597 --> 39:14.018
Do you understand? I did this
so his death wouldn't be in vain.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.480
Accidents...

39:19.232 --> 39:22.318
they happen.
We can't blame anyone for them.

39:25.822 --> 39:29.367
It's also... no good seeking revenge.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.165
I forgave the Process.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.003
I didn't give up. I didn't.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.882
And that's what Isabella needs to do.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.094
She has to keep preparing.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.306
This is where she belongs.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.352
You don't understand.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.483
I can't give you my other daughter.

40:07.322 --> 40:08.907
You're not giving her away.

40:10.867 --> 40:15.747
Look at me. I came from the same place
as you. And now I'm here.

40:18.499 --> 40:19.834
I believe in the Process.

40:28.801 --> 40:29.636
Mm.

40:32.722 --> 40:35.767
They have to say it in so many words.

40:41.230 --> 40:45.234
I need confirmation from both of you.
It's very important to me.

40:48.071 --> 40:49.072
Isabella...

40:50.239 --> 40:54.035
Isabella will apply to the Process.

40:57.330 --> 40:58.748
And she will pass.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.210
She will.

41:18.935 --> 41:19.978
Thank you.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.527
[birds squawking]

42:16.743 --> 42:18.786
[laughs]

42:18.870 --> 42:23.666
I passed! I passed!

42:23.750 --> 42:25.126
Fernando!

42:26.794 --> 42:28.087
Fernando!

42:28.921 --> 42:32.008
[laughing] I passed!

42:39.766 --> 42:41.350
I'm impressed.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.352
How did you come up with
a story like that?

42:43.436 --> 42:45.438
I did what I had to do.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.200
[shouts] Whoo!

43:29.774 --> 43:30.608
[exhaling sharply]

43:48.876 --> 43:49.710
[grunts]

44:03.432 --> 44:05.810
[instrumental theme music plays]
