WEBVTT

02:22.274 --> 02:23.209
Gemini.

02:23.241 --> 02:25.443
While mercury is in
retrograde, it's time

02:25.477 --> 02:27.580
to put your regrets behind you.

02:27.612 --> 02:29.882
Personal relationships
may become strained.

02:29.914 --> 02:31.816
But fertilize the seed
of a budding romance,

02:31.849 --> 02:34.920
and your love life will prosper.

02:34.954 --> 02:38.691
Is she even aware
how sexy she sounds?

02:38.723 --> 02:39.891
You know, by the
way, there was, like,

02:39.925 --> 02:43.195
a homeless guy out there,
like, digging through the trash

02:43.229 --> 02:44.197
in the courtyard.

02:44.229 --> 02:44.830
Oh, really?

02:54.573 --> 02:56.375
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, man.

02:56.407 --> 02:57.709
That's not a homeless guy.

02:57.742 --> 02:59.778
That's Man Bun.

02:59.812 --> 03:02.782
Top floor, $5,000 for,
like, 800 square feet.

03:02.814 --> 03:05.717
And what's he doing
rummaging through the garbage?

03:05.751 --> 03:07.253
I don't know, man.

03:07.286 --> 03:08.521
Thank
you for holding.

03:08.554 --> 03:09.955
Yeah, I
just got a delivery.

03:09.989 --> 03:12.491
And there's some extra items
in here that I didn't order.

03:12.524 --> 03:13.359
What's the name?

03:13.391 --> 03:14.259
Coleman.

03:14.293 --> 03:16.395
C-O-L-E-M-A-N.

03:16.427 --> 03:16.895
OK.

03:16.929 --> 03:18.598
OK.

03:18.631 --> 03:19.998
What's missing from the order?

03:20.032 --> 03:21.467
No, no.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.735
- Nothing's missing.
- Uh-huh.

03:22.768 --> 03:23.769
No, no.
Nothing's missing.

03:23.801 --> 03:24.736
There's just a bunch of extra...

03:24.770 --> 03:26.372
What's
the name again, sir?

03:26.405 --> 03:27.272
Coleman.

03:27.306 --> 03:28.374
Goldman?

03:28.407 --> 03:29.642
Coleman.
Coleman.

03:29.675 --> 03:30.543
With a C?

03:30.575 --> 03:31.543
Yeah.

03:31.576 --> 03:32.711
Yeah, that's fine.
Never mind.

03:32.745 --> 03:33.913
I'll look into this.

03:33.945 --> 03:35.413
OK.
Thank you.

03:35.447 --> 03:36.248
Good God.

03:39.384 --> 03:41.554
So how does this guy
manage five grand a month?

03:41.586 --> 03:42.354
That's crazy.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.423
Oh, he's like
an actor and does,

03:44.455 --> 03:46.292
like, art stuff on the side.

03:46.324 --> 03:47.092
Like, what?

03:47.126 --> 03:49.729
Takes pictures
of pictures.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.330
Pictures of pictures?

03:51.362 --> 03:52.698
Yeah, like, he
goes to a gallery

03:52.730 --> 03:54.866
and he takes, like,
pictures of pictures.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.302
And he was telling
me all about it,

03:57.336 --> 03:58.804
and I was nodding
like I was listening.

03:58.836 --> 04:00.705
And then I don't
remember what happened.

04:00.739 --> 04:03.276
Hey, do you know Ms.
Sampson across the way?

04:03.308 --> 04:05.777
I was telling her how you put
all your furniture in plastic,

04:05.811 --> 04:07.513
you know, to keep it so nice.

04:07.545 --> 04:11.883
And she said that's
what serial killers do.

04:11.917 --> 04:14.819
Kyle, why are you talking
to people about my furniture?

04:14.853 --> 04:17.956
Just to make small talk.

04:17.990 --> 04:21.026
[inaudible] If I knew I
was having company over,

04:21.060 --> 04:21.860
I would have taken it off.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.528
But I don't want
to pay damage fees.

04:23.562 --> 04:25.331
All this stuff is rented.

04:25.363 --> 04:26.665
You rented all of this?

04:26.699 --> 04:28.033
I thought it was
going to be temporary.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.502
I never found anything I
liked enough to buy it, so.

04:30.536 --> 04:31.670
Well, I hope you
like it because you've

04:31.704 --> 04:35.473
paid for it twice by now.

04:35.507 --> 04:36.776
Hey.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.311
You know about that
dude on the other side

04:38.343 --> 04:40.445
of the building that died?

04:40.478 --> 04:41.613
Yeah.
Check it out.

04:41.646 --> 04:42.615
The cops told me about it.

04:42.648 --> 04:44.016
I got the whole scoop man.

04:44.048 --> 04:46.084
This guy, he died and
they didn't find him for,

04:46.117 --> 04:46.918
like, two weeks.

04:52.391 --> 04:53.459
He looks familiar.

04:53.492 --> 04:54.527
Yeah, he looks familiar.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.627
He's lived here for years, man.

04:58.797 --> 05:00.433
That's depressing.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.367
Yeah, see, that's the
thing about suicide.

05:02.401 --> 05:03.436
It's like a real screw you.

05:03.468 --> 05:06.372
You take off and you just
leave the devastation.

05:06.404 --> 05:08.573
You know, you hit the world
like a pinata of heartbreak

05:08.607 --> 05:11.610
and tears while you ride that
white limo to that quinceanera

05:11.642 --> 05:12.810
in the sky, man.

05:12.843 --> 05:15.947
See, but the dude, he just
stuck his head in a plastic bag

05:15.980 --> 05:17.716
and wrapped tape
around his neck, man.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.752
He probably threw
up and shat himself.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.387
And then after two weeks,
he was all decomposed.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.955
- Can you imagine the mess, man?
- Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.

05:22.987 --> 05:23.988
Can you imagine that?

05:24.021 --> 05:25.990
That's enough.

05:26.024 --> 05:28.394
Now what did you
want to talk about?

05:28.427 --> 05:29.662
Oh, right.

05:29.694 --> 05:35.100
Um... two things.

05:35.134 --> 05:38.670
A, the dead dude, and B, I
talked to your new building

05:38.704 --> 05:40.773
managers last night.

05:40.805 --> 05:41.639
And?

05:41.673 --> 05:43.074
They didn't get
your rent payment yet.

05:43.108 --> 05:43.975
Well, yeah.

05:44.009 --> 05:45.578
It's because it's the 2nd.

05:45.610 --> 05:46.711
I pay on the 3rd every time.

05:46.745 --> 05:48.047
It's on automatic payment.

05:48.079 --> 05:49.447
All right, I
understand that, see.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.815
But the thing is, is that...

05:50.848 --> 05:52.817
and don't tell
anybody I told you...

05:52.850 --> 05:53.786
they bought up the
whole area, man.

05:53.819 --> 05:55.621
And all these new rich
kids are moving in,

05:55.653 --> 05:57.689
and they're paying way more
rent than the old tenants.

05:57.723 --> 05:58.891
- And they're just like...
- Pushing people out?

05:58.923 --> 06:00.658
Pushing people out.

06:00.692 --> 06:02.394
Well, they'll get
their money tomorrow.

06:02.427 --> 06:03.829
Sweet, man.

06:06.064 --> 06:08.901
Did you just get winked at?

06:08.934 --> 06:12.838
Richard, are you
online dating, man?

06:12.870 --> 06:14.105
I've always wanted to do that.

06:14.139 --> 06:16.141
Let's see.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.778
4everdaddysgirl.

06:18.810 --> 06:22.447
Well, let's see
what she looks like.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.548
Mm.

06:23.581 --> 06:26.851
Ugh, Daddy can keep her.

06:26.884 --> 06:29.587
Hey, that ugly girl reminds me,
I got a hot date tonight, man.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.724
I met this girl in samba class...

06:32.757 --> 06:34.159
samba class.

06:34.192 --> 06:35.026
So I should go.

06:38.896 --> 06:40.565
Oh, hey, Richard.

06:40.598 --> 06:41.800
Can I borrow one
of these condoms?

06:41.834 --> 06:43.134
I get so shy to buy
these in public.

06:43.168 --> 06:43.836
Yeah, go ahead.

06:43.869 --> 06:46.505
And take the cigarettes, too.

06:46.538 --> 06:49.008
I don't want those.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.175
All right, have a
good night, Richard.

06:50.209 --> 06:51.009
You, too.

07:08.759 --> 07:09.829
Hi, I'm Seana.

07:09.862 --> 07:11.129
Um, kind of nervous...

07:11.163 --> 07:12.932
I've never done this before.

07:12.964 --> 07:15.200
I'm just a small town
girl looking for a nice

07:15.233 --> 07:16.668
down to earth guy.

07:16.701 --> 07:18.971
And I look forward to
meeting you and having

07:19.004 --> 07:21.105
you meet my pride and joy.

07:21.139 --> 07:22.007
Hi, guys.

07:22.040 --> 07:22.842
I'm Renee.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.879
Hi, there.

07:26.911 --> 07:27.712
I'm new in town.

07:27.745 --> 07:29.180
And I'm just looking
for someone...

07:30.415 --> 07:33.786
...that might be able to show
me all the cool places and...

07:33.819 --> 07:37.021
I don't know... maybe open the
door for me once in a while.

07:37.055 --> 07:37.923
Thanks for watching.

07:37.956 --> 07:38.758
Bye.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.052
Oh, wow.

08:09.855 --> 08:10.956
You ready?

08:10.988 --> 08:11.790
You ready?

08:15.560 --> 08:16.728
Oh my God.

08:16.762 --> 08:19.865
Oh my God.

08:19.898 --> 08:21.767
Wow.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.069
You are crazy.

08:24.101 --> 08:25.236
You need anything?

08:25.269 --> 08:26.137
No.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.540
No, you good?

08:27.572 --> 08:28.274
I'm OK.

08:28.307 --> 08:29.542
OK, cool.

08:29.574 --> 08:30.209
Thank you.

08:30.242 --> 08:31.043
Yeah.

08:33.946 --> 08:37.582
Holy shit.

08:39.618 --> 08:40.786
I'll be right back.

08:49.595 --> 08:52.965
You know, we could try
some new stuff if you want.

08:52.998 --> 08:55.634
I mean, it doesn't always
have to be the same.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.235
Hm?

08:57.269 --> 09:00.038
I mean, if you wanted to get
a little rough once in a while,

09:00.072 --> 09:04.009
yank my hair, I could
get on board with that.

09:04.042 --> 09:04.910
OK.

09:04.942 --> 09:05.745
Yeah?

09:09.914 --> 09:11.115
I mean, no pressure or anything.

09:11.149 --> 09:13.318
I'm just, you
know, just throwing

09:13.351 --> 09:14.653
some new ideas out there.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.599
All right, well, I'm going to
jump in the shower, so lock

09:26.631 --> 09:28.266
the door on your way out, OK?

09:28.299 --> 09:30.301
OK.

09:30.335 --> 09:33.639
You like "Candid"?

09:33.672 --> 09:36.742
I published an essay
on it in my college

09:36.774 --> 09:41.013
paper, the first and last of my
illustrious journalism career.

09:45.716 --> 09:47.251
I would like to read that.

09:47.284 --> 09:49.087
Yeah?

09:49.120 --> 09:50.788
I'm sure it's still
floating out there

09:50.822 --> 09:52.024
somewhere in a dusty blog.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.394
VERONICA (ON VIRTUAL
ASSISTANT): I

09:55.427 --> 09:59.098
happen to agree with his idea of
the most important occupations.

09:59.130 --> 09:59.999
Yes.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.067
Like, what is it?

10:02.100 --> 10:06.071
Love making, malicious
gossip, and...

10:06.104 --> 10:08.706
I'm blanking on the last one.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.643
Talking nonsense and not

10:10.676 --> 10:11.777
necessarily in that order.

10:11.809 --> 10:13.311
Yeah, that's it.

10:13.345 --> 10:14.846
Oh, fuck me.

10:17.749 --> 10:18.984
VERONICA (ON VIRTUAL
ASSISTANT): Excuse me?

10:19.017 --> 10:20.419
Oh, no, no.

10:20.451 --> 10:24.056
I'm, uh... sorry, I'm on
this auto dictation thing.

10:24.089 --> 10:26.058
And I dropped something.

10:26.091 --> 10:27.058
I said, fuck me.

10:30.294 --> 10:31.896
VERONICA (ON VIRTUAL
ASSISTANT): Smiley face.

10:31.929 --> 10:33.932
So what are you doing
on a dating website?

10:38.370 --> 10:40.405
I could ask you the same thing.

10:40.438 --> 10:42.841
Oh, I'm not so sure.

10:42.874 --> 10:45.310
I mean, not to
sound presumptuous,

10:45.342 --> 10:50.149
but I'm sure you have no
shortage of suitors out there.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.984
Maybe I have social anxiety.

10:52.017 --> 10:54.286
Oh, yeah?

10:54.318 --> 10:57.889
Are you sure I was looking
at the right profile?

10:57.923 --> 10:58.724
Winky face.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.995
Did you watch my video?

11:04.028 --> 11:05.063
That's step one.

11:10.469 --> 11:14.406
Step two, playing in public.

11:14.438 --> 11:15.807
I want to hear.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.275
(SINGING) I ain't loved

11:17.308 --> 11:25.416
but three men in my life, my
father, my brother, and the one

11:25.450 --> 11:26.152
with a wife.

11:26.284 --> 11:28.153
[inaudible] I'm trouble.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.764
I've had it all my days.

11:38.797 --> 11:43.402
It seems like our attacks might
just follow me to the grave.

11:43.434 --> 11:47.972
I wish that I could
wake up and say...

11:48.005 --> 11:49.507
VERONICA (ON VIRTUAL
ASSISTANT): What are you up to?

11:49.541 --> 11:51.110
Uh, just getting
ready for bed.

11:51.143 --> 11:52.378
((SINGING)
...was all in my head.

11:55.880 --> 11:56.381
What about you?

11:59.150 --> 12:00.985
I was wondering if you'd

12:01.019 --> 12:01.953
like to meet me for a smoke.

12:04.523 --> 12:07.259
Oh, yeah?

12:07.292 --> 12:08.293
Yeah.

12:08.326 --> 12:09.128
Where?

12:11.328 --> 12:12.530
VERONICA (ON VIRTUAL
ASSISTANT): Your pool.

12:12.563 --> 12:14.399
See you in five.

12:14.432 --> 12:16.902
Yeah, great.

13:15.559 --> 13:16.361
It's 3:00 AM.

13:19.898 --> 13:20.365
What are you doing down here?

13:25.570 --> 13:26.504
Aren't you a little
young for that?

13:29.941 --> 13:30.576
I'm the Lizard King.

13:34.412 --> 13:35.214
I can do anything.

14:18.056 --> 14:18.956
Yo, yo, Richard.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.292
Good morning.

14:20.325 --> 14:21.193
Do you ever go home?

14:21.225 --> 14:22.193
Ah, that's a good one.

14:22.226 --> 14:23.661
Hey, hey, hey.

14:23.695 --> 14:26.164
There was a dude here, asking
all kinds of weird shit

14:26.197 --> 14:27.532
about you.

14:27.565 --> 14:28.500
Like what?

14:28.533 --> 14:32.070
Like... like, do you
live here, and like...

14:32.102 --> 14:34.338
ah, I can't remember the rest.

14:34.371 --> 14:37.008
Well, where did he go?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.110
I can't remember.

14:38.143 --> 14:39.110
Yo, your ride's here.

15:01.032 --> 15:01.966
Uh-huh.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.135
Huh, yeah, I got the fee.

15:04.168 --> 15:06.605
Yeah, well, that's not what I
want to hear from you, is it?

15:06.638 --> 15:09.107
Yeah.

15:09.139 --> 15:10.008
Yeah, it wasn't
our best quarter.

15:10.041 --> 15:10.943
No one's disputing that.

15:14.044 --> 15:15.680
Yeah, I know, but you can
put that on me, all right?

15:15.714 --> 15:18.984
It's a nonprofit, not a charity.

15:19.017 --> 15:20.953
Uh-huh.

15:20.985 --> 15:24.056
Yeah.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.257
Well, that was supposed
to happen last week.

15:30.361 --> 15:31.562
Well, there is a difference.

15:31.596 --> 15:34.599
Yeah, then we might
as well just...

15:34.631 --> 15:38.102
that is the power I do have.

15:38.135 --> 15:41.105
Uh-huh.

15:41.139 --> 15:43.041
Yeah, well, I don't care how
the other office is doing.

15:43.073 --> 15:45.476
This is my office.

15:45.509 --> 15:48.746
Things are always
tight around here.

15:48.779 --> 15:51.382
So we're all doing our best.

15:51.416 --> 15:52.217
We're all doing our best.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.466
What are you doing?

16:08.500 --> 16:11.235
I was just
checking your computer.

16:11.269 --> 16:12.738
For what?

16:12.770 --> 16:14.372
We've been
having some network issues.

16:14.405 --> 16:18.009
I think someone may have
brought in an unwelcome guest.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.144
What are you doing
underneath my desk?

16:20.177 --> 16:21.413
Connection is stronger.

16:21.446 --> 16:24.149
I plug in directly
to the network cable.

16:24.182 --> 16:25.216
Cable [inaudible].

16:25.250 --> 16:26.784
Couldn't you have
asked me first?

16:26.817 --> 16:28.486
I mean...

16:28.519 --> 16:30.288
I didn't
even know you were here.

16:30.321 --> 16:32.724
Yeah, but you're
using my computer.

16:32.756 --> 16:33.558
That is true.

17:05.722 --> 17:07.425
Hello?

17:07.459 --> 17:09.827
Can I
speak to, uh, Richard Coleman?

17:09.861 --> 17:10.762
This is.

17:10.796 --> 17:12.297
This is Stephanie

17:12.329 --> 17:13.831
from [inaudible] Rentals.

17:13.865 --> 17:18.103
We're looking to schedule a
time to pick up our furniture.

17:18.135 --> 17:19.805
I didn't schedule a pick-up.

17:19.837 --> 17:21.772
Well,
according to our records,

17:21.806 --> 17:25.544
you have a full living room
set and bedroom set that are

17:25.576 --> 17:27.179
in process for [inaudible].

17:27.211 --> 17:28.446
What?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.147
STEPHANIE (ON
PHONE): The furniture

17:29.181 --> 17:30.082
is in process for repossession.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.249
Hold on a second.

17:31.281 --> 17:32.317
Sure.

17:32.349 --> 17:34.519
What are you doing?

17:34.551 --> 17:36.320
Just texting.

17:36.354 --> 17:37.456
Do you mind doing
that somewhere else?

17:37.489 --> 17:40.292
I'm on a private call.

17:40.325 --> 17:43.295
Yeah, thank you.

17:43.327 --> 17:46.730
Hi, I have an
account on auto-pay.

17:46.763 --> 17:48.099
Did the card expire?

17:48.133 --> 17:49.835
I don't understand.

17:49.867 --> 17:52.403
I'm sorry,
but there's nothing more to do,

17:52.436 --> 17:54.505
unless you were to
pay the full balance.

17:54.538 --> 17:57.308
I've been making payments
on that shit for three years.

17:57.342 --> 18:00.412
I should own it by now.

18:00.444 --> 18:03.314
What's the balance?

18:03.347 --> 18:05.683
It's just over 3,800,

18:05.717 --> 18:07.486
and it would need to be
paid in full in order

18:07.519 --> 18:08.586
to avoid the repossession.

18:08.619 --> 18:09.587
No, no, no.

18:09.621 --> 18:11.123
That is ridiculous.

18:11.155 --> 18:12.624
I'm not doing that.

18:12.656 --> 18:13.424
Then
there's nothing more to do,

18:13.458 --> 18:14.860
Mr. Coleman.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.761
Look, all I know is I'm
not giving you my furniture.

18:17.795 --> 18:19.364
OK?
That's it.

18:19.396 --> 18:20.499
It's not your furn...

18:26.904 --> 18:27.605
Aw.

18:27.638 --> 18:29.640
She's so
cute, isn't she?

18:29.673 --> 18:31.643
What's her name?

18:31.675 --> 18:34.278
Chubby.

18:34.311 --> 18:36.747
Look, don't laugh.

18:36.780 --> 18:39.584
I thought she was a boy.

18:39.616 --> 18:42.453
So you can imagine my surprise
when I found the eggs.

18:42.487 --> 18:43.688
Yeah.

18:43.721 --> 18:45.524
Well, I can see how
you'd make that mistake.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.358
There's nothing
really to indicate.

18:47.392 --> 18:50.327
That's kind of you.

18:50.361 --> 18:52.664
Anyway, you should come
over sometime and meet them.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.265
Well, her, actually,
because, you know,

18:54.298 --> 18:55.834
the others don't
do anything yet.

18:55.866 --> 18:56.800
Yeah.

18:56.834 --> 18:57.635
Yeah, that'd be cool.

19:00.939 --> 19:03.708
So.

19:03.740 --> 19:10.382
So we're downsizing, and
I have to cut three people.

19:10.414 --> 19:13.350
That is such bullshit.

19:13.384 --> 19:14.853
We're already understaffed.

19:14.885 --> 19:16.788
I know.

19:16.820 --> 19:19.290
I think Daniel's just
protecting himself.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.192
What do you mean?

19:20.224 --> 19:21.725
Why do you say that?

19:21.759 --> 19:24.229
He may or may not be
outsourcing phantom gigs

19:24.261 --> 19:25.429
to his brother's event company.

19:28.633 --> 19:29.901
And if we're firing
people, then what

19:29.933 --> 19:32.369
the hell is the new guy's role?

19:32.403 --> 19:33.404
What new guy?

19:33.438 --> 19:34.239
I don't know his name.

19:39.009 --> 19:42.279
I don't know.

19:42.313 --> 19:45.217
Well, maybe you can look into
the accounts with this brother.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.285
It'd be nice to have some
kind of dirt on Daniel.

19:47.317 --> 19:47.985
It'd be good.

19:48.019 --> 19:48.920
Oh, yeah.

19:48.953 --> 19:52.656
I will deep throat
the hell out of that.

19:52.690 --> 19:55.227
Really?

19:55.259 --> 19:56.927
Yeah, that sounded a little
bit different in my head.

19:56.961 --> 19:59.364
Oh, yeah?

19:59.396 --> 20:02.567
Well, it sounded kind of...

20:02.599 --> 20:05.736
Yeah, I know.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.271
I'll see you at lunch?

20:07.305 --> 20:07.773
I'll see you at lunch.

20:41.338 --> 20:42.506
Message from Meat

20:42.539 --> 20:44.843
Market application, Veronica.

20:44.875 --> 20:45.943
OK, Roxy.

20:45.977 --> 20:47.579
Dictate.

20:48.945 --> 20:50.014
VERONICA (ON VIRTUAL
ASSISTANT): Just get home?

20:52.616 --> 20:53.652
How do
you know I'm home?

21:00.857 --> 21:02.326
VERONICA (ON VIRTUAL
ASSISTANT): Come to your window.

21:15.605 --> 21:16.607
Look up.

21:20.978 --> 21:21.779
Hey.

21:30.821 --> 21:32.089
VERONICA (ON VIRTUAL
ASSISTANT): So now

21:32.123 --> 21:33.424
we know where each other lives.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.927
Yeah.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.663
Hey, you want to come
over for a glass of wine?

21:42.133 --> 21:43.869
I know what that's code for.

21:47.471 --> 21:49.040
Ah, it's code for
let's have a drink.

21:54.545 --> 21:55.913
VERONICA (ON VIRTUAL
ASSISTANT): Be a gentleman.

21:55.946 --> 21:58.515
Buy me dinner some time.

21:58.548 --> 21:59.483
Why don't we have
dinner right now?

26:46.804 --> 26:48.006
Hey, guys.

26:48.038 --> 26:50.074
I hope you enjoy
the newest video.

26:50.106 --> 26:53.277
And don't forget to stop by
the candy shop on your way out.

26:53.309 --> 26:57.280
And don't worry, this
will be our little secret.

26:57.314 --> 26:59.217
Shh.

27:02.686 --> 27:05.155
Oh, wow.

27:05.189 --> 27:05.990
Oh, baby.

27:08.893 --> 27:09.693
Hey.

27:12.462 --> 27:14.999
You zoning out over here?

27:15.031 --> 27:17.268
Yeah, I guess I am.

27:17.300 --> 27:20.437
Well, FYI, Daniel was
looking for you earlier,

27:20.471 --> 27:22.774
and he's being a total prick.

27:22.807 --> 27:25.442
What's new, right?

27:25.476 --> 27:26.277
He's in there
with the new guy.

27:33.917 --> 27:35.686
You OK?

27:35.720 --> 27:37.122
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:40.391 --> 27:41.392
Talk later?

27:41.424 --> 27:42.226
Of course.

28:00.978 --> 28:02.814
Are you looking for
a new job, Richard?

28:02.846 --> 28:03.980
What?

28:04.013 --> 28:06.917
Are you looking
for new employment?

28:06.951 --> 28:07.985
No.

28:08.018 --> 28:09.386
Why?

28:09.420 --> 28:12.056
Because if you don't give
me that list, you will.

28:12.088 --> 28:13.890
Oh, well, I'm... you know.

28:13.923 --> 28:16.359
I haven't had time to do all the
proper staff evaluations yet.

28:16.393 --> 28:17.528
I need more time.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.429
Yeah, well, I need those
names before the end of the day.

28:19.462 --> 28:21.298
And if you can't make the
tough decisions, I will.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.000
And by the way,
if I were you, I'd

28:23.032 --> 28:24.334
make sure the red head's on it.

28:24.367 --> 28:25.368
Claire?

28:25.402 --> 28:26.203
Trust me on this.

28:30.807 --> 28:35.946
Look, uh, Daniel, can
I ask who that guy was?

28:35.980 --> 28:37.781
He'll be observing
for a few days.

28:37.815 --> 28:38.816
Observing?

28:38.848 --> 28:39.951
Observing what?

28:39.983 --> 28:40.784
Shh.

28:44.888 --> 28:46.823
Yes?

28:46.856 --> 28:47.459
Yes?

28:51.194 --> 28:52.496
Yes, I can hear you.

28:52.529 --> 28:54.432
Uh-huh.

28:54.464 --> 28:57.334
Yeah.

28:57.367 --> 28:59.836
Uh-huh.

28:59.869 --> 29:00.771
Well, move the 3:30.

29:00.805 --> 29:01.406
Make it 4:30.

29:22.125 --> 29:22.993
Rachel?

29:23.027 --> 29:24.228
It's Richard.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.196
I saw the video.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.799
We need to talk, OK?

29:28.833 --> 29:29.400
Call me back.

29:53.624 --> 29:54.491
Hey, Brian.

29:54.525 --> 29:56.227
Are you busy?

29:56.259 --> 29:58.296
No, not really.

29:58.328 --> 30:00.330
I mean, I do have some
stuff to do, yeah, but, um.

30:03.567 --> 30:06.436
Who's that?

30:06.470 --> 30:09.339
Don't worry about him.

30:09.373 --> 30:13.510
What do you know about
computer security?

30:13.544 --> 30:16.380
You mean like antivirus,
firewall, that kind of stuff?

30:16.413 --> 30:19.250
I mean, like, someone
hacking into your computer

30:19.282 --> 30:20.818
and using it to fuck
you over a barrel.

30:24.288 --> 30:26.857
Did someone hack you?

30:26.891 --> 30:29.393
Uh, let me put it
to you this way.

30:29.425 --> 30:33.297
I know enough to scare the
living shit out of you,

30:33.329 --> 30:34.832
just not enough to
make you feel better.

30:50.314 --> 30:51.515
Yo, Richie Rich.

30:51.548 --> 30:53.451
Hey, the elevators are
down for a few minutes.

30:53.483 --> 30:54.985
But you can hang here
with me if you want.

30:55.019 --> 30:55.886
It's all right.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.623
I could use the exercise.

30:58.655 --> 30:59.522
Oh, yeah.

30:59.556 --> 31:00.357
No, totally, totally.

31:04.228 --> 31:06.364
You sure?

31:06.396 --> 31:07.264
It's cool with me.

31:07.298 --> 31:08.098
That's OK.

31:12.568 --> 31:13.336
Hey, Richard, man.

31:13.369 --> 31:15.305
You didn't ask
about my date yet.

31:15.338 --> 31:16.473
Oh, yeah.

31:16.507 --> 31:17.408
How did it go?

31:17.441 --> 31:18.542
Seriously, man.

31:18.575 --> 31:19.911
We fucked.

31:19.943 --> 31:21.045
- Nice.
- Yeah.

31:21.077 --> 31:21.879
Yeah.

31:24.714 --> 31:28.919
Hey, but, like, don't you
want to know all about it?

31:28.952 --> 31:29.686
Oh, yeah.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.189
She was wild.

31:32.221 --> 31:33.490
Oh, yeah.

31:33.523 --> 31:35.125
At one point, Richard,
I pulled this move...

31:35.159 --> 31:36.694
this move, Richard.

31:36.727 --> 31:37.595
This move.

31:37.627 --> 31:38.495
This move, Richard.

31:38.528 --> 31:39.263
This move, this move.

31:43.666 --> 31:44.467
Oh, yeah.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.136
I let the furniture
guys in for you.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.038
What furniture guys?

31:53.644 --> 31:57.080
Kyle, what furniture guys?

31:57.114 --> 31:58.415
No, no.

31:58.449 --> 32:00.183
See, they had a paper
signed by... oh, right.

32:00.217 --> 32:01.986
Yeah, no, I was supposed
to give you this.

32:02.019 --> 32:03.988
So you let them just waltz
in here and take all my shit?

32:04.020 --> 32:04.688
No.

32:04.721 --> 32:07.391
See, no.

32:07.423 --> 32:08.692
I had assumed that
you had finally

32:08.726 --> 32:10.594
gotten real furniture because...

32:10.626 --> 32:12.195
because we had just
talked about that, right?

32:12.229 --> 32:13.698
We just talked about that.

32:13.730 --> 32:14.597
Man, I'm so stupid.

32:14.631 --> 32:16.233
I'm so stupid.

32:16.266 --> 32:17.535
Oh, you know what?
You know what, dude?

32:17.567 --> 32:18.402
I got a chair.

32:18.435 --> 32:19.569
I got a chair that
I don't even use...

32:19.603 --> 32:20.471
I don't even use.

32:20.503 --> 32:21.538
You can have that chair.

32:21.571 --> 32:25.175
Kyle, it's not your fault.
I know you just thought

32:25.209 --> 32:27.278
you were doing your job.

32:27.310 --> 32:30.513
So you don't
want my chair then?

32:30.547 --> 32:32.682
Yes, bring me
the stupid chair.

32:32.715 --> 32:34.584
I'm going to bring
you that chair, bro.

32:34.617 --> 32:35.452
I'm going to bring
you that chair.

32:42.159 --> 32:43.094
Hello.

32:43.126 --> 32:44.361
Thank you for calling
[inaudible] Credit.

32:44.394 --> 32:45.261
This is Lisa.

32:45.295 --> 32:46.697
How may I help you?

32:46.730 --> 32:48.531
Hi, my name
is Richard Coleman.

32:48.565 --> 32:51.134
I'm having a problem
with my account.

32:51.167 --> 32:52.235
Sorry to hear that.

32:52.269 --> 32:54.105
I'll be happy to assist you.

32:54.137 --> 32:55.772
Is this the phone number
connected to your account?

32:55.806 --> 32:58.042
Yes.

32:58.075 --> 33:00.411
Well, it looks
like your account is overdrawn.

33:00.443 --> 33:02.178
No, that's ridiculous.

33:02.211 --> 33:05.115
I have, like, 2,500
in that account.

33:05.148 --> 33:06.483
Not
according to this.

33:06.517 --> 33:08.052
But if you'd like to
dispute any charges,

33:08.085 --> 33:10.054
you can always call the fraud
protection at the number

33:10.086 --> 33:12.722
on the back of your debit card.

33:12.756 --> 33:13.657
OK, and then...

33:13.690 --> 33:14.725
then what?

33:14.758 --> 33:16.227
Disputed
charges could take up

33:16.259 --> 33:18.162
to three weeks to investigate.

33:18.194 --> 33:21.398
Jesus, three weeks?

33:21.432 --> 33:23.334
I'm
very sorry about that.

33:23.366 --> 33:25.235
We do have a new
service to protect you

33:25.269 --> 33:27.505
against overdraft charges,
essentially to cover

33:27.538 --> 33:29.205
your account for up
to a 30-day period

33:29.239 --> 33:30.607
and [inaudible] would apply.

33:30.641 --> 33:33.811
Would you be interested
in this service?

33:33.844 --> 33:34.711
Mr. Coleman?

33:34.744 --> 33:38.815
Um... yeah.

33:38.848 --> 33:40.451
What do I have to do?

33:40.483 --> 33:41.785
Just opt in.

33:41.818 --> 33:43.053
It's that easy.

33:43.086 --> 33:46.190
It's $7 a month.

33:46.222 --> 33:47.625
OK, yeah, let's do that.

33:47.657 --> 33:48.525
Great.

33:48.558 --> 33:49.359
Can you hold please?

33:54.163 --> 33:54.998
Hello.

33:55.031 --> 33:57.201
Thank you for
calling [inaudible]..

33:57.233 --> 33:58.201
- How may I help you?
- What?

33:58.234 --> 33:59.536
No, no, no.

33:59.569 --> 34:01.304
No, no, I was just
talking to somebody else.

34:01.337 --> 34:02.338
Oh.
Do you remember who?

34:02.372 --> 34:03.606
No.

34:03.640 --> 34:04.809
Well,
I'd certainly be...

34:04.842 --> 34:06.310
...more than happy to help.

34:06.343 --> 34:08.345
Is this the phone number
connected to your account?

34:08.378 --> 34:09.547
Never mind.
I'll call back.

34:09.579 --> 34:10.514
No problem.

34:10.547 --> 34:11.414
You have...

34:16.619 --> 34:17.453
Hey.

34:17.487 --> 34:18.588
I brought you my
chair, so I thought...

34:23.827 --> 34:25.262
That real?

34:25.295 --> 34:26.497
Yeah, I think so.

34:26.530 --> 34:27.865
I don't... I don't know.

34:27.898 --> 34:29.200
Can I peruse it for a minute?

34:32.869 --> 34:34.438
Oh, yeah.

34:34.471 --> 34:36.306
Yeah, yeah.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.208
That's heavy.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.643
That's nice.

34:39.675 --> 34:40.610
Oh, hey, hey.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.278
Management called and
they said that they

34:42.311 --> 34:43.713
didn't get this month's rent.

34:43.746 --> 34:45.148
And if they don't get
it by tomorrow night,

34:45.181 --> 34:46.783
they're going to send
you an eviction notice.

34:46.817 --> 34:48.786
They can't evict me for
being a day late on rent.

34:48.818 --> 34:49.753
Oh, right.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.721
Yeah, see, I misspoke
earlier in that they

34:51.755 --> 34:54.125
didn't get last month's
rent or this month's rent.

34:54.157 --> 34:54.824
So there's that.

34:54.858 --> 34:56.260
What?

34:56.293 --> 34:57.361
No, no, no.

34:57.393 --> 34:58.795
That's... that's impossible.

34:58.829 --> 35:00.431
They would've contacted me.

35:00.463 --> 35:01.632
Yeah, I don't know.

35:01.664 --> 35:02.900
Hey, did you ever
see that security

35:02.932 --> 35:04.768
footage of that guy on the roof
that blew his brains out, man?

35:04.800 --> 35:06.170
Yeah, management made
me watch that video.

35:06.202 --> 35:07.304
You know why?

35:07.336 --> 35:08.137
Because it's this
apartment, man.

35:08.170 --> 35:09.071
It's this place,
and I'm the manager,

35:09.106 --> 35:10.541
so I gotta know about
this stuff, right?

35:10.574 --> 35:11.541
See, there's this guy.

35:11.574 --> 35:12.775
He went up on the roof,
and he took his gun out.

35:12.809 --> 35:13.677
And he was like, bam, bam!

35:13.710 --> 35:15.679
Fell over the side...
it was horrendous.

35:15.711 --> 35:17.148
Give me your phone.
I'm going to show it to you.

35:17.181 --> 35:18.282
No, no.
I don't want to see that.

35:18.315 --> 35:19.250
No, no, dude.
Give me your phone.

35:19.282 --> 35:20.250
- Let me show you.
- I don't want to see that.

35:20.284 --> 35:20.751
Hey, hey, watch where
you point that thing.

35:20.784 --> 35:22.385
Look, look, look.

35:22.418 --> 35:23.286
Doesn't have an ammo clip.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.421
Look, check it out.

35:24.454 --> 35:25.322
Really?

35:25.355 --> 35:26.789
Look, yeah.

35:26.822 --> 35:28.558
Did you get this gun from
some online auction site?

35:28.592 --> 35:29.693
Is that right?

35:29.726 --> 35:31.795
Because if you did, I'm
going to tell you right now...

35:31.827 --> 35:33.596
I'm going to tell you right
now that this gun was used

35:33.630 --> 35:34.865
to snuff somebody out, man.

35:34.898 --> 35:35.932
And they're setting you up.

35:35.965 --> 35:37.867
They're trying to set you up.
And you know what?

35:37.900 --> 35:39.569
You're just going to be sitting
around this bare apartment.

35:39.603 --> 35:40.604
And you're just going
to be sitting around,

35:40.637 --> 35:41.804
minding your own business.
Knock, knock, knock.

35:41.838 --> 35:42.706
Who's there?

35:42.739 --> 35:44.375
It's the Russian mob, dude.

35:44.407 --> 35:45.509
It's the Russian
mob, and you're dead.

35:45.541 --> 35:46.576
You're as good as dead.

35:46.610 --> 35:47.544
- I know about this stuff.
- Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.

35:47.577 --> 35:49.346
- I read about this stuff, OK?
- Calm down.

35:49.378 --> 35:50.447
I don't know where I got it.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.784
I told you that
it was sent to me.

35:53.817 --> 35:57.755
A lot of crazy shit has
been happening to me lately.

35:57.788 --> 35:58.655
Do you know this girl?

36:02.358 --> 36:03.226
Yeah, yeah.

36:03.260 --> 36:04.628
She lives right there.

36:04.661 --> 36:07.798
Dude, I've been
in her apartment.

36:07.831 --> 36:08.666
Oh, here, check this out.

36:14.003 --> 36:15.873
Look at that.

36:15.905 --> 36:17.974
Stage name, Veronique.

36:18.007 --> 36:20.476
Wants to be a singer or an
actress or some shit like that.

36:20.510 --> 36:23.314
Sexy, though, right?

36:23.347 --> 36:24.615
I wonder if my smile
belies the fact that I

36:24.648 --> 36:25.950
have seen her mostly naked.

36:25.983 --> 36:26.850
That's a lie.

36:26.882 --> 36:28.050
I've seen her naked.

36:28.083 --> 36:31.788
Phone call
from see you next Tuesday.

36:31.822 --> 36:32.823
I gotta take this.

36:32.856 --> 36:34.692
I don't understand
what's happening right now.

36:34.724 --> 36:35.458
Phone call
from see you next Tuesday.

36:35.492 --> 36:36.159
What's happening
right now, dude?

36:36.193 --> 36:37.361
I gotta take this call.

36:37.393 --> 36:38.361
What's happening?

36:38.394 --> 36:39.396
Come on.
Come on.

36:39.429 --> 36:40.931
Come on.

36:40.963 --> 36:42.732
Phone call
from see you next Tuesday.

36:45.635 --> 36:46.804
I'm going to let myself out.

36:46.836 --> 36:48.539
Phone call
from see you next Tuesday.

36:51.742 --> 36:53.677
Phone call...

36:53.710 --> 36:55.246
Hey.

36:55.278 --> 36:57.248
Richard.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.248
Hey, how are you?

37:01.818 --> 37:04.455
I'm not
calling for small talk.

37:04.487 --> 37:06.356
OK.

37:06.389 --> 37:07.557
It's the last thing

37:07.590 --> 37:09.259
I want to be doing right now.

37:09.293 --> 37:10.928
What do you want
to talk about?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.262
The
constant phone calls.

37:15.364 --> 37:19.802
Wait... wait, my number
calling your number?

37:19.835 --> 37:21.804
Why would I waste
my time doing that?

37:21.838 --> 37:23.474
- I
- had the number traced.

37:23.507 --> 37:24.974
I know it's you.

37:25.007 --> 37:27.343
I... I don't know.

37:27.376 --> 37:28.045
I don't know.

37:28.077 --> 37:28.878
I mean, I...

37:31.815 --> 37:38.521
I think, um, I might be being
blackmailed or something.

37:38.554 --> 37:40.657
I know that sounds crazy, but.

37:40.690 --> 37:41.791
Why would
anyone blackmail you?

37:46.096 --> 37:47.864
I don't know.

37:47.898 --> 37:51.602
But... but they are.

37:51.635 --> 37:54.805
I worry
about you, Richard.

37:54.838 --> 37:56.707
You used to be a very
different person.

37:56.739 --> 37:57.740
Please.

37:57.773 --> 37:58.875
Please don't.

37:58.909 --> 38:02.313
After
everything that happened, you...

38:02.346 --> 38:03.681
I just wish you would've gotten
the help that you needed.

38:09.518 --> 38:11.421
Why you have
to be so condescending?

38:14.925 --> 38:17.795
I'm with somebody new.

38:17.827 --> 38:19.730
And I'm happy.

38:19.762 --> 38:22.632
I'm really happy.

38:22.666 --> 38:24.401
Please don't spoil this for me.

38:24.434 --> 38:25.503
I'm not going
to spoil anything.

38:32.509 --> 38:36.413
Wait, can I ask you something?

38:36.445 --> 38:37.847
What are you holding on to?

38:37.880 --> 38:40.116
Well, what do you mean?

38:40.150 --> 38:43.019
With us.

38:43.052 --> 38:44.954
You need to talk to someone.

38:44.987 --> 38:48.458
If it's a money thing,
Jim's a professional.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.494
I'm sure he'd be
willing to help.

38:50.527 --> 38:51.762
I don't need money.

38:51.795 --> 38:53.963
I'm glad Jim's a professional.

38:53.996 --> 38:55.498
I have plenty of money.

38:55.532 --> 38:56.834
And I don't need
your fucking charity.

38:56.867 --> 38:57.735
OK?

38:57.768 --> 38:58.635
OK.

38:58.668 --> 38:59.568
OK.

38:59.603 --> 39:04.708
I'm glad because this
needs to stop now.

39:04.740 --> 39:07.844
If you keep calling or
if I see you calling me,

39:07.878 --> 39:09.747
I'm not going to have
a choice but to file

39:09.780 --> 39:11.915
a restraining order.

39:11.947 --> 39:15.018
You understand?

39:15.050 --> 39:16.519
I've moved on.

39:16.552 --> 39:18.521
You need to move on.

39:18.554 --> 39:21.424
I haven't been
fucking calling you, OK?

39:21.458 --> 39:24.128
I don't know who is calling
you, but it's not me.

39:24.161 --> 39:26.597
I haven't called
you fucking once.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.132
All right?

39:28.164 --> 39:30.666
Hello?

39:30.699 --> 39:32.001
Hello?

39:32.034 --> 39:32.836
Fuck!

39:44.014 --> 39:45.182
Hey, it's Roxy.

39:45.215 --> 39:46.450
Leave me a message.

39:54.123 --> 39:55.125
Richard.

39:55.157 --> 39:57.027
What?

39:57.059 --> 39:59.128
Was
she always like that?

39:59.161 --> 39:59.963
No.

42:51.001 --> 42:52.369
(SINGING) The
way you stare, you

42:52.402 --> 42:55.271
got me feeling like, you
and I were meant to be.

42:58.307 --> 43:00.844
Not that you care, 'cause you
don't really have the time,

43:00.876 --> 43:02.079
but I got nowhere else to be.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.752
Come closer.

43:09.786 --> 43:11.355
Approach me with a steady look.

43:11.387 --> 43:15.692
Throw your arm
around my shoulder.

43:15.724 --> 43:16.826
I'm sorry...

43:16.860 --> 43:19.096
Buddy,
are you going in?

43:19.128 --> 43:19.996
Is there a cover?

43:20.030 --> 43:20.831
10 bucks.

43:33.009 --> 43:33.909
Yo, if you're not
going in, you've

43:33.943 --> 43:34.745
got to keep walking, buddy.

47:20.936 --> 47:21.538
Roxy, blackout.

48:40.983 --> 48:42.385
Wake up, Richard.

50:07.570 --> 50:11.074
Roxy, what time is it?

50:11.106 --> 50:13.309
9:31 AM.

50:13.342 --> 50:15.244
What?

50:15.277 --> 50:17.480
Why didn't you wake me up?

50:17.512 --> 50:19.516
All
alarms were deactivated.

50:19.548 --> 50:22.217
Useless piece of shit.

50:22.251 --> 50:24.554
I sense
that you are becoming upset.

50:24.586 --> 50:25.755
Oh, yeah?

50:25.788 --> 50:27.056
Yes, based on your...

50:33.628 --> 50:35.798
Richard Coleman?

50:35.831 --> 50:36.699
Yeah.

50:36.731 --> 50:37.534
Talk to you a minute?

50:40.702 --> 50:45.442
Actually, I'm
really late for work.

50:45.474 --> 50:48.143
We'll walk with you.

50:56.452 --> 50:57.421
Do you know this
woman, Mr. Coleman?

51:00.322 --> 51:02.224
No.

51:02.257 --> 51:04.193
I mean, no, not really.

51:04.226 --> 51:06.628
Which is it?

51:06.661 --> 51:09.264
Well, like, we met on
a dating site, so I...

51:09.297 --> 51:11.600
I... I've talked to her
on the dating site.

51:11.634 --> 51:12.869
But that's... that's it.

51:12.902 --> 51:15.105
I've never actually
met her in person.

51:15.137 --> 51:17.239
But you're a
big fan of her work?

51:17.273 --> 51:20.143
Well, I don't even really
know her work, actually.

51:20.175 --> 51:21.878
Well she's inquired
about filing a restraining

51:21.911 --> 51:22.679
order against you.

51:22.711 --> 51:24.480
Do you know why
she would do that?

51:24.514 --> 51:25.315
I have no idea.

51:27.916 --> 51:29.184
Why?

51:29.217 --> 51:30.051
Well, what did she say?

51:30.085 --> 51:31.286
Because I haven't
done anything, so.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.123
We're not saying you have.

51:33.155 --> 51:35.157
She is, but I just like
giving you creeps the benefit

51:35.190 --> 51:36.458
of the doubt sometimes.

51:36.492 --> 51:37.260
Well, I haven't done anything.

51:46.536 --> 51:47.403
Take my advice.

51:47.436 --> 51:49.873
Consider this a warning.

51:49.905 --> 51:51.373
If we have to come back
here, you'll regret it.

52:04.853 --> 52:07.823
Brent?

52:07.856 --> 52:09.826
I don't want to have
to fire you, man.

52:09.858 --> 52:11.059
I don't want to get fired.

52:11.094 --> 52:13.496
OK, well, then I need you to
tell me what this is all about.

52:13.528 --> 52:14.331
What is going on?

52:16.898 --> 52:18.167
What is this?

52:18.201 --> 52:20.436
It's an SD card.

52:20.469 --> 52:22.605
What was it doing on
my fucking computer?

52:22.637 --> 52:23.471
I don't know.

52:23.505 --> 52:25.340
I saw you fucking
with my computer.

52:25.373 --> 52:28.443
You were under my desk,
fucking with my computer.

52:28.476 --> 52:29.612
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52:29.644 --> 52:30.579
Are you hacking me?

52:30.612 --> 52:31.880
No!

52:31.914 --> 52:32.882
What are you doing to me?

52:32.914 --> 52:34.384
It wasn't me.

52:34.416 --> 52:35.184
Then who the fuck was it?

52:35.217 --> 52:35.884
I don't know.

52:35.918 --> 52:38.320
I swear to God.

52:38.353 --> 52:39.155
It wasn't me.

53:11.554 --> 53:12.855
Oh my God.

53:12.887 --> 53:16.226
Get your feet off my desk.

53:16.259 --> 53:17.427
Daniel wants to see you.

53:20.795 --> 53:22.564
He wanted to see you
hours ago, but of course,

53:22.597 --> 53:23.400
you were late again.

53:42.617 --> 53:44.786
So, you finally made it.

53:44.820 --> 53:45.788
I know.

53:45.820 --> 53:46.588
I'm sorry, I...

53:46.621 --> 53:48.490
I'm not interested
in your excuses.

53:48.523 --> 53:49.525
Where's the list?

53:49.557 --> 53:50.994
I have it.

53:51.027 --> 53:54.563
I just... I wanted to talk
to you first for a second.

53:54.597 --> 53:59.302
Um, I need a favor.

53:59.335 --> 54:00.802
A favor.

54:00.835 --> 54:05.341
Yeah, um, can I get an
advance on my paycheck?

54:08.411 --> 54:09.479
I can't tell
if you're kidding.

54:09.512 --> 54:11.481
I would never ask...

54:11.514 --> 54:13.617
Do you actually think
you deserve a favor?

54:17.519 --> 54:19.621
Depends on who's on that list.

54:19.655 --> 54:20.457
What do you mean?

54:23.425 --> 54:23.994
I'm talking about the redhead.

54:33.768 --> 54:36.338
I'm not putting
Claire on the list.

54:36.371 --> 54:37.440
Suit yourself.

54:37.472 --> 54:40.742
You're not going to do your
job, I'll do it for you.

54:40.775 --> 54:43.745
Wait, I mean,
you can't do that.

54:43.778 --> 54:45.815
I was hired to manage
that floor out there,

54:45.847 --> 54:48.550
and then that includes
making hiring and firing

54:48.583 --> 54:50.452
decisions based on my judgment.

54:50.485 --> 54:52.788
It's my call.

54:52.822 --> 54:53.623
Or what?

54:57.059 --> 54:57.861
Or I'm leaving.

55:01.864 --> 55:02.731
Fine.

55:02.764 --> 55:04.333
Clear your desk by
the end of the day.

55:04.367 --> 55:05.568
You can pick up your
last paycheck on Friday.

55:08.771 --> 55:10.539
You can't do that.

55:10.572 --> 55:12.040
Oh, I can.

55:12.074 --> 55:13.576
Actually, you've already
been replaced, so.

55:23.853 --> 55:25.488
You're making a huge mistake.

55:25.521 --> 55:26.823
Am I?

55:26.856 --> 55:28.524
I'm almost positive that
participating in acts

55:28.556 --> 55:30.025
of pornography is
strictly prohibited

55:30.059 --> 55:32.028
by the rules and regulations
of the company handbook, so.

55:35.030 --> 55:36.766
Go now before I call security.

55:43.873 --> 55:46.809
Get out of my way,
whatever your name is.

55:59.554 --> 56:00.956
Buying a lighter.

56:43.498 --> 56:44.166
Veronica?

56:52.240 --> 56:55.177
Veronica?

56:55.210 --> 56:56.111
Veronica!

57:04.954 --> 57:05.755
Wait!

57:12.795 --> 57:14.463
Hey.

57:14.496 --> 57:15.998
Ugh.

57:16.030 --> 57:18.634
If I see you following me
again, I will fucking kill you.

57:18.666 --> 57:19.835
Do you understand?

57:55.538 --> 57:56.771
Excuse me.

57:56.804 --> 57:57.672
We're closed.

57:57.706 --> 57:58.974
[inaudible]

57:59.007 --> 57:59.908
I need help.

57:59.942 --> 58:00.742
Please?

58:05.780 --> 58:06.715
Hey, we're closed.

58:06.748 --> 58:08.016
You can use the ATM.

58:08.050 --> 58:09.018
I think my account
has been compromised.

58:09.050 --> 58:12.020
Can you please help me, please?

58:12.054 --> 58:13.588
Do you... do you
have an ATM card?

58:13.621 --> 58:14.223
Yeah.

58:20.996 --> 58:21.664
All right.

58:21.697 --> 58:23.164
I'm not going to open the door.

58:23.197 --> 58:25.868
You can shove it through
here, though, OK?

58:31.574 --> 58:33.643
Let me see some ID.

58:48.856 --> 58:51.693
All right, it feels real.

58:51.726 --> 58:54.563
'Cause it is real.

58:54.597 --> 58:56.666
OK.

58:56.699 --> 58:57.666
All right, wait here.

58:57.699 --> 58:58.300
I'll be right back.

59:13.983 --> 59:14.851
I see you.

59:31.333 --> 59:32.601
I fucking see you!

59:37.338 --> 59:38.873
Hey.

59:38.907 --> 59:40.643
You need to leave the
premises right now,

59:40.675 --> 59:41.811
or I'm going to call the police.

59:41.844 --> 59:43.646
What for?

59:43.679 --> 59:45.648
Look, I don't know what kind
of scam you're trying to run,

59:45.681 --> 59:47.650
but this card is a fake, and
you need to get out of here.

59:47.682 --> 59:48.918
No, it's not.
It's not fake.

59:48.951 --> 59:49.818
I don't have a...

59:49.851 --> 59:50.920
Leave.

59:50.952 --> 59:52.320
Hey, give me my card back!

59:52.353 --> 59:54.322
Hey!

59:54.356 --> 59:56.325
Give me my fucking card back!

59:56.358 --> 59:57.160
Get out.

1:00:00.228 --> 1:00:01.364
Yo, Richard,
what you got there?

1:00:01.396 --> 1:00:02.197
Not now, Kyle.

1:00:14.409 --> 1:00:15.612
Rachel.

1:00:21.250 --> 1:00:22.251
Rachel!

1:00:22.284 --> 1:00:23.152
Rachel!

1:00:23.184 --> 1:00:26.087
What, dude?

1:00:26.121 --> 1:00:27.356
Where's Rachel?

1:00:27.389 --> 1:00:29.125
Who's Rachel?

1:00:29.157 --> 1:00:30.925
Rachel, the girl
who lives here.

1:00:30.958 --> 1:00:31.893
She can't come to the door.

1:00:31.927 --> 1:00:33.396
What do you want?

1:00:33.429 --> 1:00:34.664
I need to talk to
her for a minute.

1:00:34.697 --> 1:00:35.765
Is that all right?

1:00:35.797 --> 1:00:36.765
No, it's not all right.

1:00:36.798 --> 1:00:38.701
We're kind of busy.

1:00:38.733 --> 1:00:40.902
What's with the box?

1:00:40.936 --> 1:00:41.737
It's none of your business.

1:00:41.769 --> 1:00:42.905
What do you know
about my business?

1:00:42.938 --> 1:00:43.972
Rachel.

1:00:44.005 --> 1:00:45.306
Rachel!

1:00:45.340 --> 1:00:47.242
You better step back
before you regret it.

1:00:47.275 --> 1:00:49.210
Listen, you motherfucker.

1:00:49.244 --> 1:00:50.445
Now you're going
to listen to me.

1:00:50.478 --> 1:00:54.683
You're going to turn around,
and you're going to walk away.

1:00:54.717 --> 1:00:57.452
Turn around and walk away.

1:00:57.485 --> 1:00:59.721
Richard.

1:00:59.755 --> 1:01:00.756
What's going on?

1:01:00.789 --> 1:01:01.391
Rachel.

1:01:04.358 --> 1:01:05.427
You filmed us?

1:01:05.460 --> 1:01:06.995
Huh?

1:01:07.028 --> 1:01:08.898
There's a video of us online.

1:01:08.931 --> 1:01:09.999
Oh.

1:01:10.032 --> 1:01:12.468
Well, there's a few of them, so.

1:01:12.501 --> 1:01:14.437
Who would want
to watch you fuck?

1:01:14.469 --> 1:01:16.371
How did you think
I pay the rent here?

1:01:16.405 --> 1:01:17.907
What?

1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:19.842
Look, Richard, I always
blurred out your face.

1:01:19.875 --> 1:01:20.943
I mean, I blur
out all the faces.

1:01:20.976 --> 1:01:21.911
But you didn't blur my face.

1:01:21.943 --> 1:01:23.179
That's the whole fucking point.

1:01:23.211 --> 1:01:24.347
Yeah.

1:01:24.380 --> 1:01:26.749
Do you have any idea how
much this has ruined my life?

1:01:26.782 --> 1:01:30.286
Um, sorry.

1:01:30.318 --> 1:01:33.054
Oh, you're sorry?

1:01:33.088 --> 1:01:34.156
That's great.

1:01:34.188 --> 1:01:35.790
I'm so happy you're sorry.

1:01:35.824 --> 1:01:36.492
That's great.

1:01:36.525 --> 1:01:37.927
Then everything's fine now.

1:01:41.028 --> 1:01:43.199
Well, I mean...

1:01:46.168 --> 1:01:47.036
what do you want
me to do about it?

1:01:51.940 --> 1:01:52.809
I think you've done enough.

1:01:57.246 --> 1:01:58.180
Oh, God.

1:01:58.213 --> 1:02:00.216
Who'd pay to watch him fuck?

1:02:00.248 --> 1:02:01.216
They don't pay
to watch him, but me.

1:02:37.518 --> 1:02:38.987
Seriously!

1:02:39.021 --> 1:02:41.824
Yo, who the fuck
left the door open?

1:02:41.856 --> 1:02:42.925
Hey, bud.

1:02:42.958 --> 1:02:44.126
I'm sorry about the noise.

1:02:48.030 --> 1:02:49.565
Are you moving in or out?

1:02:49.597 --> 1:02:52.268
No, no, I've lived
here for three years.

1:02:55.070 --> 1:02:57.139
Hey, you all right, bud?

1:02:57.172 --> 1:02:58.039
Wait a sec.

1:02:58.072 --> 1:03:00.475
What floor are we on?

1:03:00.509 --> 1:03:02.844
This is the eighth floor, man.

1:03:02.878 --> 1:03:05.514
Oh, OK.

1:03:05.547 --> 1:03:08.184
Yo, I'm Dylan.

1:03:08.217 --> 1:03:09.251
Why don't you come
in for a beer?

1:03:14.188 --> 1:03:15.356
OK, fuck it.

1:03:15.389 --> 1:03:16.257
One beer.

1:03:16.291 --> 1:03:17.559
Yeah, guy, after you.

1:03:27.235 --> 1:03:31.539
Yo, Pilsner or Applegate?

1:03:31.572 --> 1:03:32.540
What's Applegate?

1:03:32.574 --> 1:03:35.610
Was it involved in some
kind of apple scandal?

1:03:35.643 --> 1:03:37.579
What?

1:03:37.612 --> 1:03:39.447
No, man.

1:03:39.481 --> 1:03:40.983
It's a craft beer.

1:03:41.016 --> 1:03:44.220
It's like an IPA, but bitterer.

1:03:44.253 --> 1:03:45.221
OK.

1:03:45.253 --> 1:03:48.923
Yeah, I'll take the one
that's less bitterer.

1:03:48.956 --> 1:03:50.358
All right, man.

1:03:51.994 --> 1:03:52.595
Thanks.

1:03:59.268 --> 1:04:00.135
Why do they do that?

1:04:02.905 --> 1:04:04.173
Do what?

1:04:04.206 --> 1:04:06.474
Gate thing, suffix.

1:04:06.507 --> 1:04:08.877
Like, why did they use
that name scandals?

1:04:08.911 --> 1:04:12.347
Because of Watergate.

1:04:12.380 --> 1:04:15.283
No?

1:04:15.317 --> 1:04:16.619
Never mind.

1:04:16.652 --> 1:04:17.619
No, I want to know.

1:04:17.652 --> 1:04:19.487
Tell me.

1:04:19.521 --> 1:04:20.956
OK.

1:04:20.989 --> 1:04:25.628
Well, it's kind of
an interesting story.

1:04:25.661 --> 1:04:28.597
When Nixon was up
for re-election,

1:04:28.630 --> 1:04:31.267
there was a break-in at the
Democratic National Committee

1:04:31.300 --> 1:04:33.435
headquarters at the
Watergate Hotel.

1:04:33.467 --> 1:04:35.203
What did they steal?

1:04:35.237 --> 1:04:37.206
They didn't steal anything.

1:04:37.239 --> 1:04:39.441
They tapped the phones,
but two journalists

1:04:39.474 --> 1:04:43.211
uncovered that it was Nixon
himself who sent the guys.

1:04:43.244 --> 1:04:44.480
So he was forced to resign.

1:04:44.512 --> 1:04:45.380
How do you know
all this stuff?

1:04:48.215 --> 1:04:51.953
Well, it's kind of common...

1:04:51.987 --> 1:04:55.224
common knowledge.

1:04:55.257 --> 1:04:56.224
You never saw "All
the President's Men"?

1:05:06.467 --> 1:05:09.437
So what are you
guys celebrating?

1:05:09.471 --> 1:05:13.275
That guy over there and
that guy just graduated.

1:05:13.307 --> 1:05:15.978
That guy, really?

1:05:16.010 --> 1:05:18.380
He looks like he's 13 years old.

1:05:18.413 --> 1:05:19.581
Yeah, he's like
kind of a genius.

1:05:24.052 --> 1:05:26.387
Well, now what?

1:05:26.420 --> 1:05:28.556
What do you mean now what?

1:05:28.590 --> 1:05:31.360
What are they
going to do for work?

1:05:31.393 --> 1:05:33.362
Well, it's his
place, and he booked

1:05:33.394 --> 1:05:34.630
a commercial last
year so he doesn't

1:05:34.663 --> 1:05:37.565
have to work for a while.

1:05:37.599 --> 1:05:39.101
What commercial?

1:05:39.134 --> 1:05:40.001
I don't know.

1:05:40.034 --> 1:05:41.202
A major one.

1:05:52.614 --> 1:05:53.416
Do you play?

1:05:56.485 --> 1:05:58.586
I used to.

1:05:58.619 --> 1:06:02.090
Play something.

1:06:02.123 --> 1:06:03.224
Come on.

1:06:03.257 --> 1:06:04.125
No.

1:06:04.159 --> 1:06:05.193
Yeah.

1:06:05.226 --> 1:06:07.028
Come on.

1:06:07.061 --> 1:06:07.563
It doesn't have to be good.

1:06:10.766 --> 1:06:11.567
OK.

1:06:16.038 --> 1:06:17.405
But you shouldn't
celebrate mediocrity.

1:06:21.208 --> 1:06:22.176
Let's see.

1:08:01.309 --> 1:08:02.111
Is something funny?

1:08:07.715 --> 1:08:11.353
And what's up with
that fucking hair, huh?

1:08:11.385 --> 1:08:13.755
What are you, a fucking samurai?

1:08:13.788 --> 1:08:15.324
Huh?

1:08:15.356 --> 1:08:17.391
Are you a fucking sumo wrestler?

1:08:17.425 --> 1:08:18.860
Huh?

1:08:18.894 --> 1:08:22.498
Oh, man, I would love to
punch you to the last breath.

1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:26.601
Dude.

1:08:30.905 --> 1:08:32.507
What are you staring at?

1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:40.282
You all right?

1:10:17.011 --> 1:10:18.246
Oh, no.

1:10:18.279 --> 1:10:20.215
No, come on.

1:10:21.983 --> 1:10:24.953
What the fuck?

1:10:53.515 --> 1:10:55.484
Oh, man, Richard,
what happened, dude?

1:10:55.516 --> 1:10:56.751
Give me your key, Kyle.

1:10:56.784 --> 1:10:57.819
What do you
mean, give me your key?

1:10:57.853 --> 1:10:58.654
- What happened to your key, man?
- I'm locked out.

1:10:58.686 --> 1:11:00.421
Wait.
Where's your key, man?

1:11:00.454 --> 1:11:01.323
It's not working.

1:11:01.355 --> 1:11:02.390
Dude, you look messed up.

1:11:02.423 --> 1:11:03.492
I can't give you my key with...

1:11:03.524 --> 1:11:04.592
oh, right, right.

1:11:04.626 --> 1:11:05.726
Because it was...
I forgot.

1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:06.728
It was deactivated, wasn't it?

1:11:06.761 --> 1:11:07.629
What?

1:11:07.662 --> 1:11:09.331
Why would it be deactivated?

1:11:09.363 --> 1:11:10.598
Management deactivated it.

1:11:10.631 --> 1:11:11.098
I was supposed to tell you.

1:11:11.132 --> 1:11:12.367
My bad, I'm sorry.

1:11:12.399 --> 1:11:13.835
That's bullshit.

1:11:13.868 --> 1:11:16.004
They can't kick me out for
being late for one month.

1:11:16.037 --> 1:11:17.005
Right, you're right.

1:11:17.037 --> 1:11:18.673
I can't believe this is
happening to me, dude.

1:11:18.707 --> 1:11:20.509
Apparently, it wasn't
one month, see?

1:11:20.542 --> 1:11:21.910
Apparently, it was
three months, but...

1:11:21.943 --> 1:11:23.478
What the fuck, Kyle?

1:11:23.511 --> 1:11:24.379
I forgot to...

1:11:24.412 --> 1:11:25.914
What the fuck!

1:11:25.947 --> 1:11:26.815
Give me that fucking key.

1:11:26.847 --> 1:11:27.681
No, you can't take my key.

1:11:27.716 --> 1:11:29.051
What are you doing
with my key, bro?

1:11:29.083 --> 1:11:29.951
No, dude.

1:11:29.984 --> 1:11:30.986
That's...

1:11:31.019 --> 1:11:32.788
I'll bring it right back.

1:11:54.876 --> 1:11:59.413
Roxy, who's in the apartment?

1:13:32.739 --> 1:13:33.809
Yeah, I'll be
down in a minute.

1:13:38.912 --> 1:13:40.081
OK, thanks.

1:13:52.926 --> 1:13:53.728
Hang on.

1:15:11.805 --> 1:15:12.840
Jesus.

1:15:15.710 --> 1:15:19.648
Well, what
are you doing here?

1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:20.281
I was worried about you.

1:15:23.850 --> 1:15:25.219
You can't just keep calling
me and not say anything.

1:15:31.125 --> 1:15:32.293
I brought you something.

1:15:36.331 --> 1:15:37.533
I thought maybe you
could use a friend.

1:15:41.002 --> 1:15:41.803
What do you think?

1:15:49.743 --> 1:15:52.613
I think that I'm
paralyzed from the neck up.

1:15:55.617 --> 1:15:56.217
Does that make any sense?

1:16:11.832 --> 1:16:16.637
I can't seem to hold a single
positive thought in my head.

1:16:16.671 --> 1:16:18.173
It's all mixed up.

1:16:18.206 --> 1:16:23.278
And all the options
lead to the same place.

1:16:31.019 --> 1:16:32.020
I don't know how to
get back on track.

1:16:38.059 --> 1:16:39.327
Can I come in?

1:16:39.359 --> 1:16:42.063
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1:17:03.317 --> 1:17:04.920
[inaudible] Richard, I...
