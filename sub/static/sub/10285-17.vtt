WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:06.340
Previously on ER:

00:06.374 --> 00:08.642
Too much has happened.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.045
I have to move out.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.746
Betina is pushing
you away

00:12.780 --> 00:14.448
because she's afraid
to depend on you.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.084
If you don't see that,
you're an idiot.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.451
I can't reach the Zofran.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.619
I don't know, Sam.
What if someone sees us?

00:18.652 --> 00:20.020
They might get the wrong idea.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.456
You've got 14 candidates

00:22.490 --> 00:23.724
going for one attending slot.
It'll be gone

00:23.757 --> 00:25.459
before you get a chance
to reschedule.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.794
I want to be an
attending here

00:26.827 --> 00:28.529
and I think I would
be a good one,

00:28.562 --> 00:30.098
so, I was wondering if maybe
you could squeeze me in

00:30.131 --> 00:31.499
like tomorrow
or the next day

00:31.532 --> 00:33.701
or...
I have a few minutes
right now.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.829
Watch out!

01:07.635 --> 01:09.237
Come on, Marquez.
Talk to me!

01:09.270 --> 01:11.305
MARQUEZ:
Got the fiber-optic.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.141
There's too much blood
and swelling.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.143
Bag him.
Was the driver drunk?

01:15.176 --> 01:16.610
Who knows?
It was a hit-and-run.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.146
80 systolic.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.213
How about a central line?

01:19.247 --> 01:20.481
Maybe I can try it?

01:20.514 --> 01:22.316
This is not a
teaching case.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.152
Yeah, but Dr. Brenner
will show his techniques to you.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.253
MARQUEZ:
Sats are up.
All right, suction

01:25.286 --> 01:26.854
on high.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.257
Well, Laverne, I'm prepping
with antibacterial soap.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.259
Don't want any nasty bacteria
into the bloodstream

01:31.292 --> 01:33.727
where it could cause
a serious infection.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.531
Hi, it's Dr. Gates.

01:37.565 --> 01:38.566
Where's the chopper?

01:38.599 --> 01:40.568
15 minutes?

01:40.601 --> 01:43.171
That's cool.
We can wait.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.306
So we got some
time to kill.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.175
Uh-huh.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.779
Hi.
Hi.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.181
Um...

01:54.915 --> 01:58.186
Luka asked me
to pick him up.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.188
Where is he?
In the car?

02:00.221 --> 02:01.189
At the park.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.656
He's not downstairs?

02:02.690 --> 02:04.258
I'm supposed
to meet him there.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.260
He said you knew.
I did know about the park.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.928
I just didn't know
he was going to send a courier.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.863
That's all.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.201
He wanted to make sure
you packed Joe's pajamas.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.336
They're in there.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.471
Come here, sweetie.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.376
Oh, here we go.

02:22.410 --> 02:25.813
Um, can you just
have him, uh...

02:27.948 --> 02:29.883
...drop him off at the
hospital tomorrow.
Sure.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.352
Okay.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.753
Or, uh, you can do it.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.788
Or whoever.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.290
I'm sorry, Abby.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.426
It's all right.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.369
You ready
for crash intubation?

02:48.402 --> 02:50.504
Well, you know me.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.940
I'm always ready.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.582
Oh, God.
What?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.917
I already know.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.320
Get over yourselves.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.395
Rebecca Smith,
front seat

03:14.428 --> 03:15.896
passenger with PSI.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.431
Tachy at 120.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.899
Systolic up to 110
with a liter.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.834
Pulse ox 95.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.670
Hey, welcome to County.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.472
MORRIS:
How's your
breathing?
It hurts.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.440
Her boyfriend Daniel.
The driver.
Why isn't he

03:26.474 --> 03:28.276
on a backboard?
Refused it.
He's got an arm lac.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.711
I'm okay.
All right, get
a wheelchair.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.414
GATES:
Grab a wheelchair.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.950
Come on.
No, man.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.619
I'm fine.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.621
I see.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.764
Oh, Abby. Good.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.767
Look, we got a lacrosse ball
versus chest waiting on films.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.836
We got a six-year-old kid
who ate a live frog.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.305
Chewed
or swallowed whole?

03:57.305 --> 03:58.639
Your guess is
as good as mine.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.308
And we got a guy
who turned blue

04:00.341 --> 04:02.042
from drinking
colloidal silver.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.877
Argyria?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.913
I once saw
a photographer

04:05.946 --> 04:07.681
who tried to poison himself
by drinking...

04:07.715 --> 04:08.982
Wow, wow, Brenner, that's...
that's really great.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.818
And I'm pretty sure

04:10.851 --> 04:12.420
that Larry and Laverne
would love to hear all about it.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.054
What's the rush, Dr. Pratt?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.589
There's a personal appointment.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.624
Well, how much is she?

04:16.656 --> 04:18.058
Ha, ha, ha.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.327
Luckily your mom gives me
a discount.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.060
(chuckles)

04:20.093 --> 04:21.695
Better watch it.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.631
That's Anspaugh's sister
you're talking about.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.965
You got a minute?
Yeah, but you got
to make it quick.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.634
Dr. Pratt,
paramedics
Yeah?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.035
bring in a 20-year-old,
hit-and-run?

04:28.068 --> 04:29.637
Yeah, he's on the
second floor in surgery.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.672
Two from the chopper.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.674
One abdomen
with guarding.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.543
Call surgery.
Upper extremity lacs.

04:35.576 --> 04:36.844
Abby, we need you.

04:36.877 --> 04:37.878
I'm in the middle
of something

04:37.911 --> 04:39.079
right now.
Uh,

04:39.112 --> 04:40.714
Brenner!
Your genius is required.

04:40.748 --> 04:41.749
Thanks, Abby.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.451
Okay.
Laverne, Larry,

04:43.484 --> 04:45.653
let's go learn together.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.054
So, what's the word?

04:47.087 --> 04:49.056
What do you hear
from upstairs?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.359
Well, you're still
in limbo land.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.826
Well, what are
they doing?

04:52.860 --> 04:54.362
Well, they're cutting
down the list.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.563
Started out with 14.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.664
Now they're down
to five,

04:56.697 --> 04:57.898
but you're still
standing.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.099
Do you think
it looks good?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.701
Yeah, it looks good.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.371
But I wouldn't put all my eggs
in one basket.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.406
Well, what does that mean?
Do you know something?

05:05.439 --> 05:06.974
Abby, I don't know anything.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.876
But nothing will make them
focus on you

05:08.909 --> 05:10.878
like getting
another offer.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.880
See you.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.548
MORRIS:
Breath sounds clear.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.716
Sats are borderline.
She needs a chest tube.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.117
Let's look
at the film first.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.686
But with the mechanism
and the right-sided...

05:18.719 --> 05:19.787
She's stable.
She may not need it.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.689
Need what?

05:21.722 --> 05:23.123
They're trying to decide
if you have a collapsed lung.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.525
Yeah, but our X ray vision
isn't working.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.593
You were the front
seat passenger?

05:25.626 --> 05:26.794
(groans):
Yeah.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.696
Must have been going
pretty fast.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.399
We found out Daniel's mom might
not make it through the night,

05:31.399 --> 05:33.100
so we were trying to get there.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.702
What do you want
for labs?
Trauma panel,

05:34.735 --> 05:36.103
type and cross four,
dip a urine.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.471
What's his mom got?

05:37.505 --> 05:39.072
Cancer.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.741
Is he all right?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.710
Uh, they're still
working on him.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.412
I'll go check.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.447
I'll prep the chest
just in case.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.115
Fine, but don't cut.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.650
I'll be a resident
in two months.
Wait for the films.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.851
Come...

05:50.884 --> 05:51.752
No sign
of head trauma.

05:51.785 --> 05:52.820
122/72.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.921
Abdomen's non-tender.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.022
Four-centimeter lac.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.089
Neck's clear.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.458
How's she doing?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.092
We're waiting
on some labs.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.428
Can I wait with her?

06:00.461 --> 06:02.129
Primary survey's
benign.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.964
TAGGART:
Hemocue's 15.1.

06:03.997 --> 06:07.835
You can visit as soon
as we get a few stitches in you.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.970
Simon, Gates, why don't you guys
go clear some patients

06:10.003 --> 06:11.705
off the board.

06:11.739 --> 06:12.706
You sure?
We're not done
checking him.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.941
I'll finish up here.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.142
Laverne can suture.

06:16.844 --> 06:20.448
Sam, I'm sure Gates
could use an assistant.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.522
How long have you
and Rebecca been together?

06:28.556 --> 06:31.792
Uh, six years.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.194
People keep telling us
to get married,

06:34.227 --> 06:35.896
but who needs a ring, right?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.665
We know how we feel
about each other.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.700
I hear that.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.834
You have someone special?

06:40.868 --> 06:44.104
I did, but she moved.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.707
Come on, Doc.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.076
You find the right person,
you don't let them get away.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.579
Yeah, well, maybe
she wasn't the one.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.482
4-0 nylon interrupted,
single layer closure.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.749
One percent with epi okay?

06:55.783 --> 06:57.885
Yeah.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.687
Sorry to hear
about your mom.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.691
Yeah.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.600
Hey.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.842
(knocking)

07:21.875 --> 07:23.511
BETINA:
It's open.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.850
Hey.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.919
What are you doing here?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.656
My job

07:35.689 --> 07:37.224
was horrible.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.726
I mean the boss would yell,
and then he'd be nice.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.027
And then yell he'd yell,

07:40.060 --> 07:41.629
"Jenkins! Jenkins!
Get over here."

07:41.662 --> 07:42.996
I mean if I wasn't
sick with the flu,

07:43.030 --> 07:44.532
my hair would fall
off from stress.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.166
So you started
drinking silver?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.801
Colloidal silver.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.570
I mean it's like a
natural antibiotic.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.104
It's not a good idea.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.773
Well, I-I thought
my sinuses would clear up.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.542
I mean, I had a
date last week

07:54.542 --> 07:56.544
and this woman actually
thought I was a Blue Man.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.078
Well, you kind of are.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.113
No. I-I mean like,
with the group.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.615
You know, Blue Man Group.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.751
Hey, Abby, lacrosse
girl's ready to...

08:03.784 --> 08:05.753
Wow.
You see that?

08:05.786 --> 08:07.087
I get a lot of "wow"s.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.656
You look like that guy
I saw on Oprah.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.990
Is it-it...

08:10.023 --> 08:11.224
Doc, isn't there
something I can do?

08:11.258 --> 08:12.993
Yeah, quit drinking it.
Yeah.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.795
The silver is deposited
into your skin like a tattoo.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.929
There's nothing
that can help.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.097
Dr. Morris?

08:17.130 --> 08:18.932
Larry's doing a chest tube.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.934
Give him Solaquin.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.102
What-what is that?

08:22.135 --> 08:23.771
Uh, fading cream.
I think it's

08:23.804 --> 08:24.772
what Michael
Jackson used.

08:24.805 --> 08:25.806
I told him to wait.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.140
Larry is a free spirit.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.909
(groaning)

08:28.942 --> 08:30.811
All right, a little pain is
normal as the tube passes.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.312
(screaming)
Wh-what's he doing?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.181
I have the same
question.
I couldn't find you.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.783
Where's the chest
x-ray?

08:35.816 --> 08:37.183
Not back yet.
But her sats are down

08:37.217 --> 08:38.751
and she lost
breath sounds
Okay, stop.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.120
on the right.
It could be a contusion.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.789
Go take care of the house
and see your mom.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.624
I'm not going anywhere.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.192
Another liter of saline
and up the oxygen.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.694
Please, I don't need you here.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.795
I'm not...
I'm not gonna leave you.

08:47.828 --> 08:48.862
I'd never do that.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.799
We don't... have...

08:51.832 --> 08:53.801
(alarm beeping)

08:53.834 --> 08:55.603
Yo. What's happening?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.237
Her lung collapsed.
Larry, push it!

08:59.740 --> 09:00.340
All right.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.709
Oh, God.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.644
No, no, this is
gonna help.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.282
(gasping)

09:09.316 --> 09:12.620
See? Much better.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.955
(coughs)
Pulse ox is trending up.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.025
Th-thank you.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.226
Are you all right, baby?

09:19.259 --> 09:20.260
You all right?

09:20.293 --> 09:21.629
Better.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.631
Much better.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.132
I'm not gonna leave.
I'll be right back,

09:25.165 --> 09:26.366
all right?
Okay.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.768
I'll be right back.
Okay.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.902
Hey, uh, I got
to call my family

09:28.936 --> 09:30.237
and let 'em know
where we are.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.772
Is there a phone
or something I can use?

09:31.805 --> 09:33.674
Yeah, front desk.
I'll show you.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.042
I asked you not to come.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.309
And what did you expect me
to do,

09:36.343 --> 09:37.778
pretend this isn't happening?

09:37.811 --> 09:38.946
You could have sent a card.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.148
It's more your style.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.951
You know why
you didn't know I was sick?

09:43.984 --> 09:45.919
Because you never
dug deep.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.688
That's not true.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.322
If we weren't talking about
who makes the best drinks,

09:49.356 --> 09:51.692
we were talking
about the Bulls game.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.694
You never once
asked about me.

09:53.727 --> 09:54.862
Oh, come on.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.996
We spent a lot of time together.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.030
Doing what?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.365
Avoiding opening up?

09:58.398 --> 10:00.067
Avoiding getting personal?

10:02.335 --> 10:05.238
Look, I don't...
I don't think it was like that.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.907
You're one of those guys

10:06.940 --> 10:08.909
that likes someone on his arm,

10:08.942 --> 10:11.178
but the moment they start
opening up their heart,

10:11.211 --> 10:13.313
you freeze.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.217
All right, look, I...

10:17.250 --> 10:18.819
I didn't come here to upset you.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.988
No, you came out of obligation.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.957
So do us both
a favor

10:23.991 --> 10:26.359
and get out.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.396
Get out!

10:29.429 --> 10:31.064
So, how's it going?

10:31.098 --> 10:33.200
Oh, pretty good.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.238
Considering Luka moved out.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.339
He what?

10:39.372 --> 10:41.408
Why?

10:41.441 --> 10:43.043
I don't know.
These past few months

10:43.076 --> 10:44.712
between my stuff
and his dad,

10:44.745 --> 10:46.279
he just needs some time.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.748
And space.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.349
How much space?
A lot of space.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.284
I'm sorry.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.086
I'm trying not
to freak out about it.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.388
Um, you know, I'm sure things
will go back to normal soon.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.725
Why don't we, uh,
have dinner tomorrow night?

10:57.758 --> 10:59.226
That would be nice.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.194
Okay. Good.
I'll call you, yeah?
Okay.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.896
Frank...

11:02.930 --> 11:04.832
here's the chart
for gymnast girl.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.734
Did you forget
where to put it?

11:06.734 --> 11:08.736
No, I told you
I was going to meet you,

11:08.769 --> 11:10.838
but I need another car.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.874
Just wait there.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.342
I should be out of here
in an hour.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.011
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

11:18.045 --> 11:21.348
NEWS REPORTER (on TV):
Well, Sandra, from the looks
of this next story...

11:21.381 --> 11:23.283
You know where I can
get some coffee?

11:23.316 --> 11:25.418
it seems Hollywood
has come to Chicago.
Jumbo Mart.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.754
It's being described as a
modern-day Bonnie and Clyde.
(sighs)

11:26.754 --> 11:28.488
What did Britney
do now?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.090
At about 11:00 this morning,
Jumbo Mart's
across the street.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.458
a young couple ran
into this jewelry store

11:31.491 --> 11:33.326
and robbed the place
at gunpoint.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.262
This early stage, there's still
a lot more questions

11:35.295 --> 11:36.997
than there are answers
right now. As you can see

11:37.030 --> 11:38.265
this is a very active
crime scene.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.767
The police have put up the tape.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.134
They're not letting us
through...

11:41.168 --> 11:42.770
RASGOTRA:
You Americans
and your guns.

11:42.770 --> 11:43.871
FRANK:
Scumbag kids.
That's what too many

11:43.904 --> 11:45.372
"time-outs"
gets you.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.439
...Sending the owner
of this local favorite

11:46.473 --> 11:48.141
to nearby St. Jude's hospital.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.010
Police right now still
are looking for the pair

11:50.043 --> 11:54.014
who got away with an estimated
$40,000 worth of diamonds.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.382
FRANK:
Sir.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.450
If you wanted coffee,
it's that way.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.486
That's okay. I'm good.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.992
Sonosite's ready.
That was scary.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.794
You okay?

12:06.827 --> 12:09.329
Yeah, when, uh, when I made
my call, the news was on.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.799
Something happened downtown.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.934
A jewelry store was robbed
or something.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.003
You saw it on the news?

12:16.036 --> 12:18.105
MORRIS:
Spleen looks okay.
WESTON:
The supermarket

12:18.138 --> 12:19.406
down the street
from me just got robbed;
so did the gas station.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.141
It's the economy.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.409
People are desperate.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.244
You guys live nearby?
In Wheaton.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.113
Wheaton? It's nice out there.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.348
All those old houses.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.150
Yeah, I worked my butt off
for a two-bedroom.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.218
Fixed up the kitchen.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.820
He did the roof, too.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.387
I couldn't put a shelf up
from IKEA.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.256
Yeah, I wasn't going
to pay ten grand

12:36.289 --> 12:38.058
for something I could do
myself, you know?

12:38.992 --> 12:41.161
Hey, you got a sec?

12:41.194 --> 12:43.096
What do you need?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.098
It's about an MVC.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.267
MORRIS:
Oh, the hit-and-run?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.402
Yeah, the kid's
still up in surgery.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.338
Wanted to know if
he got a license plate
before he passed out.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.106
Okay, uh, find Dr. Brenner.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.274
He worked on him.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.076
Thanks.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.949
You guys all right?

13:01.982 --> 13:04.985
Yeah...

13:05.018 --> 13:06.987
Just thinking about
my mom, you know?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.956
I don't know
where I should be.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.258
I feel like I need
to be here and there.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.160
Get Surgery.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.028
I just called;
they're closing up.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.129
Shouldn't be long.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.198
Daniel, please go.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.867
WESTON:
Looks like a liver hematoma.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.034
What's that?

13:21.068 --> 13:22.202
Some bleeding
around the liver,

13:22.235 --> 13:23.536
usually heals
without surgery.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.405
All right.
MORRIS:
Listen,

13:25.438 --> 13:27.274
Rebecca's going
to be a while,

13:27.307 --> 13:29.242
so maybe you should go.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.378
I'm the only family
that Rebecca's got.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.281
She's, she's stable.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.516
Take my cell number, okay?

13:36.549 --> 13:38.318
Call me when you get
to your mom's.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.520
I'll give you a full update.
Daniel...

13:40.553 --> 13:42.055
listen to the doctor.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.423
Dawn, take him out

13:43.456 --> 13:45.058
for Rebecca's admit forms,
and you call me.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.126
Okay, I mean it.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.161
Thanks, Doc.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.232
Here. We need
Rebecca's doctor's info.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.300
Is this it?

13:53.333 --> 13:54.601
I really got to go.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.336
Yeah, just sign
here and here.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.438
Oh, Sam, uh, they ordered
a splint

13:58.471 --> 14:00.908
on your carpal tunnel
lady in 2.
Got it.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.943
He wouldn't let me leave
if she wasn't okay, right?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.111
Don't worry.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.379
Dr. Morris knows his stuff.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.448
What're you looking at?
None of your business.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.986
Headhunters?
What, are you leaving us?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.321
Frank, can you
get me the numbers

14:14.354 --> 14:16.256
to Rush, Mercy and St. Joe's?

14:16.289 --> 14:18.225
What, you want to find out
who dumped the meth head in 3?

14:18.258 --> 14:19.659
No, it's personal.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.628
Oh, good. Then find
the numbers yourself.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.430
REPORTER (on TV):
We have an update

14:23.463 --> 14:25.265
on an earlier story.
Maybe they caught these guys.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.934
Police have now released
a sketch of the wanted suspects

14:26.934 --> 14:28.468
in the jewelry heist downtown.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.670
They're asking
if you have any information

14:30.703 --> 14:32.639
to please call their hotline.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.374
Again, the owner
of the jewelry store...

14:34.407 --> 14:36.243
Here, this is the
hospital number

14:36.276 --> 14:38.311
just in case you can't
get a hold of Dr. Morris.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.281
...stable condition;
he is expected to survive.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.449
Good luck.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.366
RASGOTRA:
What room?
FRANK:
Trauma 2.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.334
You brought eight units?
TAGGART:
Whoa, who's bleeding out?

15:01.368 --> 15:03.070
Woman in 2
took a bad turn.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.437
I want four of FFP
and a ten-pack of platelets

15:04.471 --> 15:05.705
and hold an OR.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.207
Fourth unit of "O"-neg is up.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.608
Pressure down to 60.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.977
Okay, let's look
at the liver again.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.511
Where are we?
Rebecca?

15:11.544 --> 15:13.313
Wait, why is the tube
in her mouth?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.048
She stopped breathing.
Just got the page.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.449
We're swamped up there.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.517
MORRIS:
We've got persistent
hypotension.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.986
Chest is clean.
Whoa.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.421
Oh, God.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.423
What's wrong?
What's happening?

15:23.456 --> 15:25.425
Her belly's full of blood.
Must've blown a clot.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.494
I thought you said
she was all right.
She was.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.162
DAWN:
We lost the pulse, PEA.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.098
Starting compressions.
Thoracotomy tray.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.532
What are you doing?
She can't generate a pulse.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.167
We need to open the chest

15:34.201 --> 15:35.635
and clamp the aorta
at the diaphragm.

15:35.668 --> 15:36.603
RASGOTRA:
If that works,
the bleeding stops.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.105
I can take her to the OR

15:38.138 --> 15:39.339
and repair
the abdominal injuries.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.640
Sterile drapes.
Ten blade.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.345
Come on, baby. Come on.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.413
Really spread them.
Like this?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.015
Okay, don't let me close them.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.482
That's the ulnar nerve.
Very cool.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.284
I got a kid who
fell off a unicycle.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.653
Excuse me. I'm teaching.
Can you find a resident?

15:53.686 --> 15:56.456
Hey.
What's up, Mommy Dearest?

15:56.489 --> 16:00.060
Unicycle boy, a few leg lacs
and a probable fracture.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.194
Pretty uncomfortable.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.030
I see what the problem is.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.232
Your bicycle's missing a wheel.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.699
Very funny.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.336
It hurts.
This is Dr. Gates.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.139
All right,
can you feel this?

16:12.172 --> 16:15.208
Wiggle your toes.
(groans)

16:15.242 --> 16:16.576
Why do you ride
that thing anyway?

16:16.609 --> 16:18.145
I'm into all types
of weird stuff.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.713
So is she.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.250
All right, I need
a tib fib and an ankle, okay?

16:23.283 --> 16:24.751
We're gonna call your parents
and get you out of here.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.519
Nah, don't bother him.

16:26.553 --> 16:29.222
My dad's probably snaking
a toilet somewhere.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.458
In order to give you an X-ray
and meds, we need consent.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.426
I'm consenting.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.461
Where do I sign?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.196
It's the law.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.697
In the meantime, we'll keep
you in a splint, okay?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.099
I'll be right back.
All right.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.201
$40,000 worth of diamonds.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.203
You know where I'd be
with that kind of dough?

16:43.236 --> 16:45.172
Home, with a big
bag of chips

16:45.205 --> 16:47.207
watching a ginormous
flat-screen?

16:47.240 --> 16:49.242
Bingo.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.813
What else can you do?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.482
Come on. There's got
to be something else you can do.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.417
We're going to try, Daniel.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.587
Her aorta's been clamped
for 45 minutes.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.489
She's been given
a massive blood transfusion.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.425
If she hasn't responded by now,
I don't think we can save her.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.095
She was fine an hour ago.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.529
You said I could go.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.500
We, we could explore
the right chest.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.834
She's bleeding in the belly.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.603
Then operate on the belly.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.305
What about it?

17:18.338 --> 17:19.439
I can't send a woman
without a pulse to the OR.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.174
She's young and healthy.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.175
Yeah, listen to him. Come on!

17:22.209 --> 17:23.343
You don't know Rebecca.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.384
(gloves snapping)
Sorry.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.620
No, don't... don't say
you're sorry. Keep working!

17:33.653 --> 17:35.255
Neela, Neela.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.290
The guy's mother is dying.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.658
Can we at least
give it a try?

17:38.691 --> 17:39.826
RASGOTRA:
We've already done everything.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.194
We really have.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.230
No, you haven't.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.864
Whatever's
wrong with her,

17:44.897 --> 17:46.366
you're going to fix it.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.438
And-and you're going
to fix it now.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.877
Close those blinds.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.179
MORRIS:
Daniel, what are you doing?

17:59.212 --> 18:00.547
You! Close those blinds.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.514
MORRIS:
Daniel, I'll get it.

18:01.548 --> 18:02.649
You stay there!

18:03.550 --> 18:05.318
Get that.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.653
What about these?

18:06.686 --> 18:08.155
Why are you doing this?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.689
What about these windows?
Cover them.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.158
MORRIS:
Come on, man.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.392
This doesn't need
to happen, Daniel.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.726
You don't need to do this.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.362
Let's just talk
for a minute, all right?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.230
Get this one. Come on.
Up here, let's go.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.498
There's nothing to...
Just do it before I use this!

18:18.531 --> 18:19.532
Use the sheet!

18:19.566 --> 18:20.900
Get up there!

18:20.933 --> 18:23.503
MORRIS:
Daniel, look at me.
Come here.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.837
Come here, just
for a second, please!

18:24.871 --> 18:26.806
You, come here.
Help her.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.708
Okay! Okay! Okay!

18:30.843 --> 18:32.745
Daniel, look at me.
I think you misunderstood me.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.448
Listen, I need you to operate.
Okay, okay.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.416
I want you to do it now.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.417
I am.
Now!

18:37.450 --> 18:38.451
Okay.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.719
Here!

18:40.753 --> 18:42.189
Ladies, come on.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.556
You've got
to hurry up.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.258
Quickly.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.694
Got it. I've got it.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.496
Let's go. Get down. Operate.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.497
I haven't got
the right supplies.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.698
Then get what you need!

18:53.600 --> 18:54.567
Whoa, what are you doing?

18:54.601 --> 18:56.303
What are you doing?!

18:56.336 --> 18:57.870
I'm calling the OR for...
No, no, no phones.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.939
Well, then you have to come
upstairs with me.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.341
I'm not leaving this room!

19:01.374 --> 19:02.375
She has to.

19:02.409 --> 19:03.610
We don't have a choice!

19:07.814 --> 19:09.582
Fine. Dial.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.518
You do something stupid,

19:11.551 --> 19:12.619
I'm going to use this.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.221
Hello, this is Dr. Rasgotra...

19:14.221 --> 19:15.688
What happened?

19:15.722 --> 19:16.923
Whatever is going on,
we can work it out,

19:16.956 --> 19:18.525
I promise you.
No, we can't, man.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.826
Yes, we can. We can!

19:19.859 --> 19:21.328
RASGOTRA:
I need it right now!

19:21.361 --> 19:22.795
Dawn, prep the belly.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.231
I know you love this woman.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.466
Okay, I know you do,

19:26.499 --> 19:27.967
but if you want
to help Rebecca, we need

19:28.000 --> 19:29.636
to take her to the OR!
You have to let us

19:29.669 --> 19:30.970
to the OR!
Did you hear me?!

19:31.003 --> 19:33.706
I'm not leaving this room!

19:33.740 --> 19:36.443
I'm on the news.
They know who I am, all right?

19:36.476 --> 19:38.611
Morris, I need you to assist.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.348
Please, doc, don't push me.

19:41.381 --> 19:44.517
All right.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.653
Listen... what did you do?

19:46.686 --> 19:47.854
Did you, did you
hurt someone?

19:47.887 --> 19:49.456
Did you rob someone?

19:49.489 --> 19:51.391
Let me help.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.859
You're the guys
from the jewelry store?
Oh, my God.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.527
Shut up.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.330
Shut up! Everyone needs
to focus on Rebecca!

19:57.364 --> 19:58.865
We're going to do that.
We're going to focus on Rebecca,

19:58.898 --> 20:00.567
but I need you
to settle down, please.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.770
We're out of masks.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.305
I'll go get some
from next door.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.539
No, stop! Where are you going?

20:06.573 --> 20:07.774
Where are you going?
Get back here!

20:07.807 --> 20:09.509
Okay! Okay!

20:09.542 --> 20:10.543
We have to have masks.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.812
We have to have them.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.647
I said forget it.
All right.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.782
You got to save her.

20:15.815 --> 20:16.883
You got to save her right here.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.451
Right now or no one's leaving.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.725
Okay.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.269
I don't understand
why you're even in Chicago.

20:36.303 --> 20:38.671
Oleg Popov was speaking
at the Art Institute.

20:38.705 --> 20:39.739
Morphine's on board.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.674
Who's Popov?
A clown?

20:41.708 --> 20:43.976
You missed your mathlete
competition for a clown?

20:44.010 --> 20:45.612
TAGGART:
Five-oh nylon?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.647
Yeah, go for it.
You're willing to give up

20:47.680 --> 20:48.781
nationals for a Russian clown?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.350
Dad.
Mathlete?

20:50.383 --> 20:51.818
Sounds serious, huh?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.653
MIT's already
got their eye on this kid.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.356
Dad, Popov never
comes to Chicago.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.024
I thought you were
finished with this.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.059
Didn't tightrope-walking
across the football field

21:00.092 --> 21:01.561
teach you anything?

21:01.594 --> 21:02.629
You did not.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.831
It was so cool.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.736
All right, I'm going to get
a few stitches in here.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.571
Sam, can you check to see
if his X-rays are ready?

21:11.604 --> 21:13.340
Sure, I'll check.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.475
Down to the symphysis pubis.
Okay.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.610
Okay, let's drop an NG
to decompress the stomach.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.978
Why aren't you
operating?

21:19.011 --> 21:20.780
Well, we don't have
what we need.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.849
It's okay, all right?
We're prepping for surgery.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.919
What's going on?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.855
Thank you, Jacy.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.060
Are you guys actually
going to...?
Yes, we are.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.061
Do you need some help?

21:35.094 --> 21:36.729
Just leave the tray.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.532
Does Crenshaw know about this?

21:39.566 --> 21:41.434
Yes, he does! Now go.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.380
(cars passing)

22:13.533 --> 22:16.102
(murmurs)

22:17.069 --> 22:19.806
How you feeling?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.708
(sighs)

22:21.741 --> 22:24.444
It didn't go exactly as planned.

22:24.477 --> 22:27.714
I had polyps in the
distal sigmoid colon.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.550
They couldn't do
a simple anastomosis.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.153
So that means a colostomy?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.423
Mm.

22:36.423 --> 22:39.426
No, you can't call
it a colostomy.

22:39.426 --> 22:42.161
They removed my entire colon.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.464
I have a loop ileostomy.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.434
Well, that's not that bad.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.635
It's only temporary.

22:48.668 --> 22:49.969
Won't last forever.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.939
It's disgusting.

22:52.972 --> 22:57.710
Well, you know, we could put
a little Gucci bag around it,

22:57.744 --> 23:00.046
make it a little bit
more vogue.

23:05.618 --> 23:08.154
He said you sat there

23:08.187 --> 23:09.889
and waited through
the whole thing.

23:10.890 --> 23:15.061
Yeah, well... you know me.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.465
Sometimes I'm hardheaded.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.170
You know what you said
to me earlier?

23:24.203 --> 23:26.172
(winces)

23:26.205 --> 23:28.775
Yeah, let's talk
about it later.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.747
You were right.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.583
I don't go there.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.584
I never have.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.619
I kind of...

23:39.652 --> 23:44.056
used what I learned for patients
in my personal life.

23:44.090 --> 23:48.728
Don't get too involved.
Don't... get too attached.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.165
But I don't want that anymore.

23:57.937 --> 24:01.508
Remember that day
we went to see that condo?

24:03.042 --> 24:07.914
I was thinking, "Why the hell
am I buying a condo?

24:09.048 --> 24:12.952
"Pretty soon
Betina and I, we...

24:12.985 --> 24:15.522
we could be getting
a house."

24:16.589 --> 24:19.559
You never told me that.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.662
I know.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.531
I ignored it,

24:24.564 --> 24:27.133
but that little voice
in my head--

24:27.166 --> 24:29.135
it wouldn't go away.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.977
So I'm here,

24:38.010 --> 24:40.980
and not out of obligation,

24:41.013 --> 24:45.852
but because I'm...

24:45.885 --> 24:47.253
because I'm in love.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.957
Okay?

24:53.225 --> 24:55.795
I'm in love with you.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.804
(sighs)

25:18.685 --> 25:19.952
RASGOTRA:
Metz.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.888
Elevate
the peritoneum.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.590
Like this?
Mm-hmm.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.757
Does he know what he's doing?

25:24.791 --> 25:26.225
He's doing fine.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.727
I don't want a student
operating on her.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.596
I need an assistant.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.764
Well, then, you do it.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.265
You're more senior.
No problem, no problem.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.735
Go, come on. Switch it up.
All right, okay, okay.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.069
I need, uh...
I got it.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.738
...exposure
on the right upper quadrant.

25:38.771 --> 25:39.939
Bovie.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.173
We were this close.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.609
Everything was going to be done.

25:42.642 --> 25:43.610
Looks like a bad

25:43.643 --> 25:44.844
hepatic laceration.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.813
You know,
we get this house.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.214
Friend gets us a loan.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.149
Two years later,
the payments double.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.317
Stellate, chromic...
Came home and found a...

25:51.350 --> 25:52.885
...on a liver needle.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.021
...foreclosure notice
on my door.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.889
I don't know.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.091
But, Doc, hey, we never meant
to hurt that old guy.

25:59.125 --> 26:02.695
We just wanted to get the rocks,
sell them off, keep the house.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.196
Guys, look at this.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.132
What?

26:06.165 --> 26:08.134
Cardiac activity.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.902
Is she better?

26:09.936 --> 26:13.305
The heart is
beating on its own.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.174
See, I knew it.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.175
You were right.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.309
He was right.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.878
Now, all you guys need to do

26:18.911 --> 26:20.179
is, is finish
operating on her

26:20.212 --> 26:23.315
so Rebecca and I
can get out of here.

26:23.349 --> 26:24.383
All right?

26:24.416 --> 26:27.219
Come on.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.222
We'll, uh...

26:30.256 --> 26:32.091
w-we'll get a helicopter
or something.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.195
Something to take us
somewhere.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.931
You know?
All we did
was open her up.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.266
We haven't repaired
anything yet.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.868
No, no, come on.
It's working,

26:41.901 --> 26:42.869
Right, Doc?
It's working.

26:42.902 --> 26:43.903
It's working, right?

26:43.936 --> 26:46.338
Yep.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.140
Yep, it's
working.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.910
If we c... if we can fix
the liver, we have a chance.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.845
Then keep going.

26:52.879 --> 26:53.913
'Cause she's going to make it.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.014
Come on. Keep going.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.115
Pickups
and needle driver.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.953
More lap pads.

27:00.987 --> 27:03.055
You broke both your bones
in your lower leg:

27:03.089 --> 27:04.991
your tibia and fibula.

27:05.024 --> 27:08.761
Shoot, I was going to take
pantomime class next week.

27:08.795 --> 27:09.962
I'm gonna take him
into Trauma

27:09.996 --> 27:11.931
and do a reduction
under fluoro.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.700
(stammering):
A what?

27:13.733 --> 27:14.867
Oh, that's when we put
the bones back in place

27:14.901 --> 27:16.035
using X ray guidance.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.436
Does it hurt?
Don't worry.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.105
We'll put some good stuff
in your IV, buddy.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.773
How about some
etomidate?
12 migs.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.141
I'll see you
in a few minutes.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.442
I'm gonna call Charlie
and tell him

27:23.475 --> 27:25.077
I need the rest
of the day off.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.046
My dad doesn't get me.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.414
I'd give my left testicle

27:28.447 --> 27:29.982
to go to clown college
in Florida.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.250
All the greats study there.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.085
Well... he's just looking out
for you.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.987
He doesn't like clowns.
He doesn't like circuses.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.989
I feel like he found
me on a doorstep.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.125
Every kid says that
at some point in his life.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.160
Well, I don't want to be
one of those people

27:41.193 --> 27:42.428
who sit around miserable all day

27:42.461 --> 27:43.796
working for retirement.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.231
You sound
pretty insightful.

27:45.264 --> 27:46.999
You must have given this
a lot of thought, huh?

27:47.033 --> 27:48.968
I pay attention.
That's all.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.136
All right.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.738
Here's what
we're going to do.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.172
We're going to watch
that monitor back there,

27:53.205 --> 27:54.974
look at the X rays
while I manipulate your leg.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.476
Okay?

27:57.509 --> 27:58.845
Impressive.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.112
Hmm. You got a deck of cards?

28:00.146 --> 28:02.148
Not on me.

28:02.181 --> 28:05.985
I also don't have
a tubular stockinette.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.186
All right, I'll be right back.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.822
Don't juggle any needles.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.223
MORRIS:
Another suture pack?

28:11.257 --> 28:13.292
Cut.
No, liver's oversewn.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.094
MORRIS:
Another lap pad.
What are you guys doing?

28:15.127 --> 28:16.829
Exploratory laparotomy.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.064
Why are you guys
doing this here?

28:18.097 --> 28:19.065
Why aren't you in the OR?

28:19.098 --> 28:20.266
It's too busy.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.367
All right,
let's check hemostasis

28:21.400 --> 28:22.434
and unclamp
the aorta.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.003
WESTON:
Okay...

28:24.036 --> 28:25.404
there.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.439
Whoa, whoa!
Clamp it!
Clamp it!

28:27.473 --> 28:28.941
What happened?
Did you mess up?
More suction,
lap pads.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.176
DANIEL:
I thought you fixed it.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.510
MORRIS:
We're trying, Daniel, okay?

28:31.543 --> 28:32.779
We need more blood,
another eight units.

28:32.812 --> 28:33.880
No cardiac activity,

28:33.913 --> 28:35.447
resuming compressions.
Wh-What?

28:35.481 --> 28:36.783
Did her heart stop again?
It doesn't look good.

28:36.816 --> 28:37.516
It's a retrohepatic injury.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.517
She's torn the liver

28:38.550 --> 28:39.952
right off the vena cava.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.453
DANIEL:
What, what does that mean?

28:41.487 --> 28:43.055
Come on. Someone's got
to spell that out for me.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.356
We really need to
isolate the liver.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.792
RASGOTRA:
Daniel, the main blood vessel

28:45.792 --> 28:47.059
from the liver
has been torn off,

28:47.093 --> 28:48.327
and it connects to
an even bigger vein,

28:48.360 --> 28:50.196
and it's a very
complicated procedure.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.398
DANIEL
You can do that.
Come on, Doc. You can do that.

28:52.431 --> 28:53.499
RASGOTRA:
20 silk

28:53.532 --> 28:55.034
on an SH needle.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.036
Come on, Doc.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.470
Vascular clamp.

29:01.307 --> 29:06.212
All right, gently...
elevate the left lobe.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.020
How's that?

29:14.053 --> 29:15.321
I can't get a good bite.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.222
Come on.
Y-you did the other thing.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.057
You can do this.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.091
Come on. Come on.
I'm trying.
50 Prolene.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.893
Come on.
Try harder.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.194
MORRIS:
Daniel, Daniel, Daniel,
see this thread?

29:23.896 --> 29:25.898
If we can sew the
veins back together

29:25.932 --> 29:29.135
and stop the leaks,
she will have a...

29:30.602 --> 29:32.338
(grunting)

29:38.110 --> 29:39.311
Run, Neela!

29:41.848 --> 29:43.115
(gunshot)

29:43.149 --> 29:45.084
(panting)

29:45.117 --> 29:47.854
You take another step,
I'll shoot you.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.589
You hear me?

29:50.622 --> 29:53.225
I'll kill you all.

29:55.261 --> 29:58.530
Okay, everyone,
this way, this way.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.531
What happened?

29:59.565 --> 30:00.166
We'll explain everything
when you get outside.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.468
Please, through the doors.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.435
You in charge?
Yeah.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.971
Sergeant Deturno.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.438
Where are the people
who got out?

30:06.472 --> 30:08.140
Over here.
Hey, are we going
to get seen?

30:08.174 --> 30:09.175
Okay, Sophie,
can you help him out, please?

30:09.208 --> 30:10.276
Yeah, yeah,
follow me.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.844
We have shuttle buses outside.

30:11.878 --> 30:12.344
Frank, have you called
County Dispatch?

30:12.378 --> 30:13.379
Yes.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.580
Yes, close us to trauma,

30:14.613 --> 30:15.848
close us
to all paramedic traffic

30:15.882 --> 30:17.283
due to internal disaster.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.885
Dawn was in there.
So was our intern Larry.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.119
I want you guys
down the hall.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.221
Make sure the patients
are cleared.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.522
Miss, please exit
through that door.
Tell me about the guy.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.124
He's out of his mind.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.993
He thinks his girlfriend
is going to wake up.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.527
Who's still in there?
Neela, Morris, and Gates.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.129
They're playing along.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.931
Come on. Come
through here, please,

30:31.964 --> 30:32.999
and exit all the way
out the doors to the street.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.033
Have you seen my son?

30:34.066 --> 30:35.401
Uh, he's probably outside.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.903
N-N-No, I checked;
he's not there.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.537
What room was he in?

30:38.570 --> 30:40.572
Trauma 1 with Gates.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.474
Then he's still
back there.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.011
You left my son?
Sir, sir!

30:45.044 --> 30:46.545
Sir!
Sir, sir, get back!

30:46.578 --> 30:47.914
My kid is back there.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.448
Sir, the police will get him.

30:49.481 --> 30:50.983
Please...
When?
After this loony kills him?

30:51.017 --> 30:52.484
He's got nothing
to do with this!
Sir!

30:52.518 --> 30:54.086
Listen.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.487
You're putting him
in greater danger.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.156
Now, let us
do our job.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.025
Okay?
Come on.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.459
I'll take you outside,
okay?

31:00.492 --> 31:02.361
RASGOTRA:
Oh-chromic.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.130
Where is everyone?

31:04.163 --> 31:05.097
MORRIS:
They're, they're evacuating
the building.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.665
What are they doing?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.600
GATES:
They probably have
the place surrounded, man.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.269
If you'd have minded
your own business,

31:10.302 --> 31:12.038
everything would have
been okay, you know?

31:12.071 --> 31:13.940
Daniel, Daniel, hey, this
is about Rebecca, okay?

31:13.940 --> 31:15.607
Don't do anything
you're going to regret.
Yeah,

31:15.641 --> 31:17.009
a little late for that now,
don't you think?

31:17.043 --> 31:20.980
(clanking)

31:21.013 --> 31:22.581
What was that?

31:22.614 --> 31:25.985
GATES:
That's my patient.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.353
I got to get
him upstairs.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.956
No way, no way.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.223
Look at his leg.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.591
It's broke in four places.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.460
Yeah, that's not my problem,
is it?

31:34.493 --> 31:36.228
The kid can't move.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.696
He can't get blood to his foot;
if I don't get him

31:37.729 --> 31:39.198
to the operating room,
he'll lose his leg.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.299
You want that?
No one is leaving

31:40.332 --> 31:42.134
until Rebecca's fixed.

31:42.168 --> 31:44.036
You understand me?

31:45.637 --> 31:47.606
Damn it.

31:47.639 --> 31:48.607
(sniffles)

31:48.640 --> 31:50.109
(sighs)

31:50.142 --> 31:51.610
Let me...
let me take a look at that.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.045
Cut short, right
to the knot.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.180
GATES:
All right.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.985
What are you doing?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.724
Look, Gates is right.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.460
You want him to be
able to walk, right?

32:08.494 --> 32:10.629
Don't put this
on me, Doc.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.564
I just want to get my girl help,
all right?
I know, I know, Daniel.

32:12.598 --> 32:17.469
Daniel, he's a kid
who's petrified.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.105
You ever, ever
been petrified?

32:19.138 --> 32:22.341
(panting)

32:26.712 --> 32:28.680
How's the repair
coming, Dr. Rasgotra?

32:28.714 --> 32:32.684
Not bad, I'm, uh, just
tying off the bleeders.

32:32.718 --> 32:35.221
Yeah, heart's filling well
now that it's clamped.

32:35.254 --> 32:39.091
See, we're doing okay.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.027
Let's not get
the kid into this.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.695
BRENNER:
All right, get her in there.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.164
Out of the way! Out of the way!

32:45.197 --> 32:46.732
We need these guys
out of the way!

32:46.765 --> 32:48.667
Sam, we need the criticals
taken care of first.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.236
TAGGART:
Okay.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.171
I'll be right back
as soon as I can, okay?

32:52.204 --> 32:53.272
Hey, Frank!

32:53.305 --> 32:54.506
Can you help me with this?

32:54.540 --> 32:55.741
FRANK:
Yeah.
Excuse me.

32:55.774 --> 32:56.775
Coming through
here, guys.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.477
Give me that.
Okay.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.079
I'll take it.
WOMAN:
Were you guys inside?

33:00.112 --> 33:02.314
Do you know what happened?

33:02.348 --> 33:03.682
Excuse me. Can you move
out of the way, please?
Yeah, do you mind?

33:03.715 --> 33:05.217
Have you guys seen Neela?

33:05.251 --> 33:06.518
She's still inside.

33:06.552 --> 33:07.686
What do you mean inside?

33:07.719 --> 33:08.787
She's in there
trying to repair

33:08.820 --> 33:09.721
a retrohepatic caval injury.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.257
In the trauma room?

33:11.290 --> 33:12.624
She told me
you knew.
Yeah.

33:12.658 --> 33:13.592
Why would I let her do
something like that?

33:13.625 --> 33:14.360
He had a gun on her.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.427
What?

33:15.461 --> 33:17.063
Will you fill him in?

33:17.096 --> 33:18.397
All right, guys,
packed away.
Excuse me.

33:18.430 --> 33:19.565
We need this area
cleared.
Excuse me...

33:19.598 --> 33:20.699
Hey.
Is there any news?

33:20.732 --> 33:22.401
No, nothing at all.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.370
You know, if I get him
out of there alive,

33:24.403 --> 33:26.072
he could unicycle Russia
for all I care.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.074
If I find out anything,
you'll be the first to know.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.208
Okay? Excuse me.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.743
(commotion stirring)

33:31.777 --> 33:33.379
Hey!

33:33.412 --> 33:34.413
Excuse me.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.714
Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.783
Excuse me, please.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.688
Hey! You guys
can't go

33:42.721 --> 33:44.456
back there!
This guy's good.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.757
He's a doctor.
Dad?
Oh, my God.
Got to get him

33:45.791 --> 33:46.692
to the Ortho Clinic
next door.

33:46.725 --> 33:47.726
Thank you.

33:47.759 --> 33:48.760
Hey.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.229
You all right?

33:50.262 --> 33:51.730
Yeah, I'm fine.
Good.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.199
I'm glad you're okay.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.101
Let's go!

33:57.203 --> 34:01.440
(phone ringing)

34:14.553 --> 34:15.487
Talk.

34:18.324 --> 34:19.658
Hello?

34:21.627 --> 34:23.762
Uh, yes. Good. Okay.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.632
The, uh, blood bank tech's
in the hall.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.766
DANIEL:
No, no.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.636
Tell him to go.

34:30.668 --> 34:34.306
She needs it, Daniel.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.742
She needs more
transfusions.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.444
We'll stay here. You go.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.545
You get it.

35:00.832 --> 35:03.802
Kick it.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.272
Kick it down here.
Is there anything else
I can get you?

35:06.305 --> 35:07.773
No, just give me the blood.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.375
We want to work this out,
Daniel.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.809
This doesn't have to happen
like this.

35:10.842 --> 35:12.578
Just give me the damn blood!

35:26.392 --> 35:29.561
Unclamp the aorta.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.730
Okay... there.

35:33.832 --> 35:37.203
Clamping again.

35:39.871 --> 35:43.209
(phone ringing)

35:53.719 --> 35:55.787
Hello.

35:57.389 --> 36:00.259
Okay. Hold on.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.361
They want to talk to you.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.368
Hello.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.502
Daniel?

36:10.536 --> 36:11.737
Sergeant Deturno.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.239
Yeah, what do you want?

36:13.272 --> 36:14.540
We want to help you, Daniel.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.375
If you want to help,

36:16.408 --> 36:18.310
you figure out a way to get me
and my girl out of here

36:18.344 --> 36:19.745
as soon
as she's better.

36:19.778 --> 36:20.979
Then nobody gets hurt.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.314
How about that?

36:22.348 --> 36:23.715
Well, we can't get you anything

36:23.749 --> 36:25.451
until you let me come in there
and talk.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.985
I don't want to talk to you.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.988
Daniel, this is the hard way.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.523
Let's make this easier, huh?

36:31.557 --> 36:33.292
Yeah, yeah.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.593
You want, you want to see hard,
keep on your yap.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.695
Daniel...

36:52.811 --> 36:54.813
If we could wake her up,
we would.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.648
Shut up.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.749
This sucks.

36:57.783 --> 36:58.850
I know.

36:58.884 --> 36:59.851
I know, losing someone...

36:59.885 --> 37:01.353
We had plans.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.455
We were gonna get
our house back.

37:03.489 --> 37:04.690
We're gonna
put a patio

37:04.723 --> 37:07.893
in the yard.

37:07.926 --> 37:11.430
She wanted to plant a garden.

37:11.463 --> 37:14.300
You should say good-bye
to her, Daniel.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.638
It's time to say good-bye.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.873
Sooner you do this,
the sooner she can let go.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.842
Then you can go see your mom.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.711
My mom?!

37:25.744 --> 37:27.779
Yeah.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.681
She died five years ago.

37:31.383 --> 37:32.784
Pancreatic cancer.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.620
I was with her
when she took her final breath.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.755
Okay, okay, so you've been
through this before.

37:36.788 --> 37:37.856
I get it.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.558
Doc, I won't do it again.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.793
You don't have a choice, Daniel.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.563
Okay, because she is
not waking up.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.967
Okay, now, you have
done everything.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.069
Everything that a man
would do for his family.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.871
Even today.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.806
You were trying to get
the pieces of your life back.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.907
I get it.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.343
Anyone can
understand that.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.077
We never meant
to hurt anybody.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.380
I know, so why...
why start now?

38:04.883 --> 38:07.886
I mean...

38:07.919 --> 38:09.888
even if we could get her back,

38:09.921 --> 38:12.691
her brain has been deprived
of so much oxygen,

38:12.724 --> 38:16.061
she would be bedridden,
unable to talk or function.

38:16.094 --> 38:17.363
Don't say that.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.464
It's true.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.665
Don't say that.
It's true.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.767
Is that what you want?

38:21.800 --> 38:23.935
Is that what
she would want?

38:37.115 --> 38:39.385
When I stop
these compressions...

38:42.087 --> 38:45.391
she's going to leave us.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.395
And you'll do what's right.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.065
(sighs)

38:54.099 --> 38:56.402
(sobbing)

39:18.156 --> 39:21.427
You remember when we met
at the coffee shop that night?

39:23.161 --> 39:26.432
That wasn't the first time
I had seen you.

39:29.935 --> 39:33.472
Day before I was walking
down Hill Street,

39:33.505 --> 39:37.008
and I noticed you
going into the bookstore.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.711
So I went in and hid
behind a bookshelf,

39:39.745 --> 39:42.714
and watched you work all day.

39:42.748 --> 39:45.817
And when you were reading
Goodnight Moon to some kids...

39:48.754 --> 39:51.823
I thought how can I get
a girl like that?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.860
You know?

40:02.501 --> 40:04.470
I'm so sorry.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.472
I tried to fix it.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.474
I tried to make it better.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.577
It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.970
(sobbing)

41:08.734 --> 41:11.603
Daniel...

41:11.637 --> 41:15.006
why don't you hand me the gun

41:15.040 --> 41:18.109
and I can tell the police
it's over.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.119
(sighs)

41:45.070 --> 41:48.139
I'm sorry for putting you guys
through this.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.847
You tried, Doc.

41:55.881 --> 41:58.149
I know you tried.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.084
It's okay.

42:03.354 --> 42:06.625
Just pass it to me.

42:19.705 --> 42:21.072
(crashing)

42:25.143 --> 42:27.278
Daniel?

42:27.312 --> 42:29.615
Daniel?
