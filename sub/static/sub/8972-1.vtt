01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:22.484
What?

01:35:22.517 --> 01:35:25.988
I didn't make that cake,
I bought it.

01:35:26.021 --> 01:35:27.890
I knew that.

01:35:27.923 --> 01:35:29.858

in the world you could do
to disappoint me.

Now you listen, there was
a time when I thought the rodeo
was everything.

01:36:57.245 --> 01:37:00.282
That the rodeo was what
made me a man.

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:06.855
I'm not much in soft words,
but you brought a joy into my
life that I never knew.

01:37:06.889 --> 01:37:08.924
Because of you, I see
what's really important...

01:37:08.957 --> 01:37:14.296
and it ain't winning
no darn rodeo.

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:17.332
You want to walk away,
then that's fine, you just
say the word...

I'm here.

is your champion!

I suppose you're gonna be too
busy at school for a part-time
job.

01:39:28.463 --> 01:39:33.735
Yeah, probably, but I'd sure
like to come back next summer
if you'll have me.

to the hotel.

Priscilla, I'll pick you up
in the morning.

Yeah, I'll-- I'll see you out.

Duke--

01:39:53.255 --> 01:39:55.523
Yeah, you first.

01:39:55.557 --> 01:39:59.394
I hope you can forgive me
for keeping you and Priscilla
apart all these years.

01:39:59.427 --> 01:40:01.029

01:40:01.063 --> 01:40:03.365
Yeah, yeah, I know.

Look, that's--
that's in our past.

01:40:09.071 --> 01:40:11.173
I'd really like her
to come back next summer.

01:40:11.206 --> 01:40:15.310
And maybe you and Laura Mae
could come for the holidays.

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:21.416
You think that New England's
gonna take a liking to an
old cowboy like me?

Think it's about time we had a
little change, don't you think?

Abby!

pretty great girl.

You must have done
something right.

So, I suppose they'll keep you
pretty busy at vet school?

They say a Vet Med degree is
harder than an M.D.

to write any letters.
