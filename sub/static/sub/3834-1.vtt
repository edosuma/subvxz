01:46.054 --> 01:48.784
<i>The child is dead.</i>

01:49.658 --> 01:54.994
<i>He breathed just for a moment.
Then he breathed no more.</i>

01:55.063 --> 01:59.261
<i>The child is dead. Dead. The child is dead.</i>

02:24.659 --> 02:27.685
I'm afraid it will kill her.

02:27.796 --> 02:30.697
My God, she wanted a baby so much.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.191
For such a long time.

02:43.945 --> 02:47.904
What can I tell her? What will I say?

02:55.690 --> 02:58.625
You could adopt a child.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.830
She wanted her own.

03:47.909 --> 03:50.469
If I may suggest,

03:50.545 --> 03:53.013
it even resembles...

03:57.119 --> 03:59.815
Your wife need never know.

04:01.723 --> 04:08.219
It would be a blessing to her
and to the child.

04:16.571 --> 04:19.596
Are there no relatives?

04:19.708 --> 04:21.767
None.

04:25.313 --> 04:28.214
The mother died, as your own child,

04:30.385 --> 04:32.853
in the same moment.

04:36.057 --> 04:38.958
You said it could be ours, but...

04:39.027 --> 04:42.463
On this night, Mr Thorn,

04:42.564 --> 04:45.226
God has given you a son.

05:26.808 --> 05:28.867
Here's your boy.

06:11.353 --> 06:13.480
<i>Good morning. Come va?</i>

06:25.634 --> 06:29.661
- What are you doing home so early?
- Just came to start packing.

06:29.738 --> 06:30.568
What?

06:30.672 --> 06:34.904
<i>We can't waste any time. We're leaving
in the morning. Buongiorno, Carlo.</i>

06:34.976 --> 06:37.342
Please, Carlo.

06:37.445 --> 06:39.743
What are you talking about?

06:39.848 --> 06:44.911
I am talking about London. I am talking about
the ambassador to the Court of St James.

06:44.986 --> 06:49.082
- Well, what about him?
- You're married to him.

06:49.157 --> 06:51.990
I'm what?

06:52.093 --> 06:57.326
It's me. I'm appointed
ambassador to Great Britain.

07:32.233 --> 07:35.999
I've already told them yes.
I loved it the minute I saw it.

07:36.104 --> 07:38.163
Well, it's a bit much.

07:38.239 --> 07:44.508
Well, nothing's too much for the wife
of the future president of the United States.

07:44.612 --> 07:46.944
You know, you're pushy.

07:47.015 --> 07:49.506
Come on. Wait till you see this.

07:51.019 --> 07:54.978
Now this, they call his day room.

07:55.056 --> 07:57.149
His day room.

08:00.862 --> 08:03.387
So? How do you like it so far?

08:04.265 --> 08:09.635
- Well, it needs some books. To warm it up.
- Couple of books. Warm it up. Yeah.

08:42.370 --> 08:48.639
- Something in mind, Mr Ambassador?
- Why don't we have a little look upstairs?

08:48.710 --> 08:52.806
Well, there's no furniture up there, either.

08:58.486 --> 09:02.388
You know, you could be
too sexy for the White House.

09:33.288 --> 09:36.314
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I won't be long.

09:36.424 --> 09:38.858
We don't have that much to talk about.

09:38.927 --> 09:42.954
Since when did two old college roommates
not have much to talk about?

09:43.064 --> 09:47.364
Since one of them assumed
the awesome burden of the presidency.

09:47.469 --> 09:51.872
- Well, give my regards to the first lady.
- I'll do my best.

09:52.707 --> 09:56.074
Why don't you change you mind,
fly over with me?

09:56.144 --> 09:59.978
No, I'd better stay here
and fool around with Damien.

10:03.051 --> 10:05.952
- Where is he?
- He was right behind us...

10:06.888 --> 10:08.947
Damien?

10:20.335 --> 10:22.326
Oh, my God, Robert.

10:22.403 --> 10:25.167
Damien! Robert, where could he be?

10:33.348 --> 10:37.114
You little monkey.
Don't you ever do that again.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.747
There you are.

11:01.175 --> 11:03.905
- Go.
- Hooray.

11:20.862 --> 11:24.229
- Run out of film?
- Just saving a bit for his canonization.

11:24.332 --> 11:27.426
- How's that?
- He's either the heir to the Thorn millions

11:27.535 --> 11:30.663
- or Jesus Christ himself.
- Want a bite, Daddy?

11:45.153 --> 11:48.611
Go on, Damien. Smile. A big birthday smile.

11:50.258 --> 11:52.692
Come on. Smile.

11:52.827 --> 11:54.454
Holly.

11:55.830 --> 11:58.663
- I'll take him, ma'am.
- No, I'll take him.

11:59.867 --> 12:01.027
Come on.

12:31.899 --> 12:35.096
One... two... three...

12:35.203 --> 12:38.434
Let me jump on it, Daddy. Let me jump on it.

12:48.650 --> 12:50.709
Hold on.

12:58.493 --> 13:00.552
Damien.

13:04.365 --> 13:06.731
Damien, look at me.

13:06.868 --> 13:09.098
I'm over here.

13:09.170 --> 13:12.628
- Damien, I love you.
- Look. There's Nanny.

13:12.940 --> 13:17.036
Look at me, Damien. It's all for you.

13:24.686 --> 13:26.244
Oh, my God.

13:40.368 --> 13:42.097
Go, Tom.

14:54.208 --> 14:57.541
- Morning. Have you read the papers today?
- No, I haven't.

14:57.612 --> 15:00.877
There was an article on the suicide,
your nanny thatjumped.

15:01.015 --> 15:04.746
- They say that she left a suicide note, sir.
- Not true.

15:04.819 --> 15:07.686
Mr Ambassador,
did you know she was on drugs?

15:07.789 --> 15:10.349
Would you mind?

15:10.424 --> 15:13.621
- Mr Thorn, did she use drugs?
- Not that I know of.

15:13.694 --> 15:17.687
- The article said...
- I don't care what the article said.

15:20.568 --> 15:22.661
I'm sorry.

15:22.770 --> 15:27.264
I am sorry.
Will you send me a bill for the damage?

15:28.476 --> 15:33.277
No, that's all right, Mr Ambassador.
Let's just say you owe me.

15:33.381 --> 15:35.440
Corporal.

15:36.017 --> 15:38.076
OK, outside.

15:45.660 --> 15:46.592
Yes?

15:46.661 --> 15:49.459
<i>- There's a Father Brennan here to see you.
- Who?</i>

15:49.530 --> 15:51.930
<i>A priest named Father Brennan from Rome.</i>

15:52.066 --> 15:55.661
<i>He says it's a matter of
urgent personal business.</i>

15:55.736 --> 15:58.933
<i>- Never heard of him.
- He says he just needs a minute.</i>

15:59.073 --> 16:03.237
<i>- Something about a hospital.
- Donation time.</i>

16:03.845 --> 16:08.214
- All right, send him in.
- I didn't know you were such a soft touch.

16:08.282 --> 16:11.718
On that trip to Saudi Arabia,
why isn't it the right time?

16:11.953 --> 16:16.652
Well, it's personal, Tom. I just
don't feel like leaving home right now.

16:29.871 --> 16:31.930
Yes, Father?

16:33.374 --> 16:37.970
We haven't much time.
You must listen to what I have to say.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.641
All right. What is it?

16:41.716 --> 16:46.380
You must accept Christ as your savior.
You must accept him now.

16:48.389 --> 16:54.294
Forgive me, but didn't I understand that you
have a matter of urgent personal business?

16:54.362 --> 16:59.561
You must take Communion.
Drink the blood of Christ and eat his flesh.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.693
Only if he is within you
can you defeat the son of the devil.

17:02.770 --> 17:06.398
- I see.
- He's killed once. He'll kill again.

17:06.507 --> 17:09.169
He'll kill until everything that's yours is his.

17:09.277 --> 17:13.111
- Father, would you mind...
- Only through Christ can you fight him.

17:13.180 --> 17:15.478
Accept the Lord Jesus.

17:15.549 --> 17:18.017
Drink his blood.

17:18.819 --> 17:21.878
I've locked the door, Mr Thorn.

17:21.955 --> 17:25.983
<i>- Yes?
- Would you send for a security guard?</i>

17:26.294 --> 17:29.195
I beg you, Mr Thorn.
Listen to what I have to say.

17:29.297 --> 17:31.822
<i>Ambassador Thorn?</i>

17:31.933 --> 17:36.836
I was at the hospital, Mr Thorn,
the night your son was born.

17:37.571 --> 17:40.734
<i>- I witnessed the birth.
- Sir?</i>

17:42.209 --> 17:44.370
I beg you.

17:47.014 --> 17:49.744
All right. Stand by.

17:55.356 --> 17:58.723
- What do you want?
- To save you, Mr Thorn.

17:58.793 --> 18:01.523
So Christ will forgive me.

18:04.465 --> 18:07.366
What do you know about my son?

18:07.435 --> 18:10.734
- Everything.
- And what is that?

18:13.474 --> 18:16.534
I saw its mother.

18:16.610 --> 18:18.976
- You saw my wife.
- I saw its mother.

18:19.046 --> 18:21.981
- You're referring to my wife.
- Its mother, Mr Thorn.

18:22.049 --> 18:25.576
This is blackmail. Come out and say it.
What are you trying to say?

18:25.653 --> 18:28.383
His mother was aja...

18:28.956 --> 18:32.187
- Everything OK?
- You sounded strange. The door was locked.

18:32.259 --> 18:36.559
- I want this gentleman escorted out of here.
- OK, let's go.

18:37.798 --> 18:40.790
Accept Christ each day.

18:40.868 --> 18:42.961
Drink his blood.

19:26.280 --> 19:30.478
- Just get him off the grounds.
- All right, Father. Come on.

19:35.856 --> 19:37.915
Father.

19:38.459 --> 19:40.518
Thank you.

20:37.618 --> 20:39.711
Come in.

20:40.387 --> 20:43.720
Excuse me. Mrs Baylock is here.

20:45.092 --> 20:47.583
She says she's the new governess.

20:47.695 --> 20:50.596
Well, that's a start. Show her in.

20:51.999 --> 20:54.092
Come in, please.

20:54.969 --> 20:58.132
- Ambassador and Mrs Thorn.
- How do you do?

20:58.205 --> 21:03.575
I know it's a difficult time for you,
so I'll not intrude on your grief.

21:03.644 --> 21:07.740
I'm here to take away
some of your troubles and anxieties.

21:07.815 --> 21:11.376
We'll soon help your little boy
to forget what's happened.

21:11.452 --> 21:14.421
I'm afraid, sir,
that some of our young nannies,

21:14.522 --> 21:18.356
they get homesick,
or they have boyfriend problems.

21:19.426 --> 21:23.157
I left all that behind a long time ago.

21:23.230 --> 21:27.030
Well, now, if you'll let me see your boy?

21:29.170 --> 21:32.469
Yes, of course. He's upstairs.
I'll show you where it is.

21:32.573 --> 21:37.806
Why don't you just leave us alone at first?
Let us get acquainted in our own way.

21:37.878 --> 21:42.247
- Well, he's shy with new people.
- Oh, no. Not with me, he won't be.

21:44.485 --> 21:47.545
- Well, I don't think...
- I think it'll be fine.

21:47.621 --> 21:50.283
Go on. Give it a try.

21:51.792 --> 21:53.987
All right, then.

21:54.061 --> 21:56.655
- Mrs Horton.
- This way, Mrs Baylock.

21:56.764 --> 21:58.823
Excuse me.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.874
- I like her.
- She seems all right.

22:08.976 --> 22:11.035
Where'd you find her?

22:12.012 --> 22:14.071
- Where did I find her?
- Yeah.

22:14.181 --> 22:17.673
I didn't find her. I assumed you found her.

22:20.821 --> 22:24.257
Round that corner to the right
and it's the door facing you.

22:24.325 --> 22:28.489
- I'll have your things sent up in a moment.
- Thank you.

22:30.598 --> 22:33.931
- Mrs Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

22:34.034 --> 22:37.834
I'm sorry, but we're a little bit confused.

22:37.905 --> 22:39.998
Oh? Why's that?

22:40.074 --> 22:44.511
- Well, we don't know how you got here.
- The agency.

22:45.512 --> 22:50.211
- The agency?
- Well, yes. They read in the paper about the...

22:51.719 --> 22:55.655
well, about your first nanny,
so they sent you another.

22:56.624 --> 22:59.889
- That's it.
- I'll call to confirm that.

23:02.863 --> 23:06.526
- Here are my references.
- Thank you very much.

23:07.968 --> 23:12.837
Well, if I could see your boy, now?

23:13.107 --> 23:15.632
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

23:39.366 --> 23:41.527
Have no fear, little one.

23:44.305 --> 23:46.796
I am here to protect thee.

24:01.088 --> 24:04.546
- In a minute, Horton, I think.
- Very good, sir.

24:10.164 --> 24:13.292
- Kathy.
- I'm coming. Mrs Baylock.

24:16.603 --> 24:18.764
- Mrs Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

24:18.839 --> 24:21.205
- Where's Damien?
- If you don't mind,

24:21.308 --> 24:23.742
I think he'd rather go to the park.

24:23.811 --> 24:27.611
- The park? I told you he was going with us.
- He's too young for church.

24:27.715 --> 24:31.173
- He'll cause a fuss.
- You don't seem to understand.

24:31.251 --> 24:35.711
It is my wish and my husband's wish
that Damien accompanies us to church.

24:35.789 --> 24:38.815
- Kathy.
- I'll be there in a minute.

24:38.992 --> 24:42.393
Now, please have him dressed at once.

24:42.529 --> 24:45.987
Well, excuse me
for speaking my mind, ma'am,

24:46.066 --> 24:48.660
but do you really think a five-year-old

24:48.769 --> 24:53.797
will understand the goings-on
of an Episcopal wedding?

24:53.874 --> 24:59.574
Will you have my son dressed and in the car
in five minutes? Thank you very much.

25:57.104 --> 25:59.664
What's the matter, Damien?

26:02.109 --> 26:04.839
It's just a church, that's all.

26:05.913 --> 26:08.404
What's the matter?

26:09.349 --> 26:11.442
- Robert.
- Something wrong?

26:11.518 --> 26:15.750
- I don't know. He just seems scared to death.
- Is he ill?

26:17.291 --> 26:19.953
No, he's just...

26:20.060 --> 26:22.858
No, he's just trembling all over.

26:44.318 --> 26:47.685
- Mr Ambassador. Welcome, sir.
- Good morning.

26:48.055 --> 26:50.546
- No!
- Damien.

26:57.865 --> 27:00.129
Damien, stop it.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.862
Damien, stop it. Damien.

27:02.936 --> 27:04.961
No!

27:05.305 --> 27:07.364
Horton, drive on.

27:23.023 --> 27:26.891
Are you sure that
you don't wanna call a doctor?

27:26.960 --> 27:30.760
No, it's just a couple of bruises.
It'll be all right in the morning.

27:30.831 --> 27:33.527
No, I mean for Damien.

27:34.935 --> 27:39.372
Oh, no, he's fine. He's sound asleep.

27:39.439 --> 27:42.567
Just to have him examine him.

27:44.144 --> 27:48.547
Well, he's perfectly all right.
Never been sick a day in his life.

27:48.615 --> 27:53.609
He never has, has he?
Isn't that a little strange?

27:55.255 --> 27:57.223
Is it?

27:57.324 --> 28:00.760
I mean, no measles or mumps or chickenpox.

28:00.827 --> 28:04.194
- Not even a cough or a cold.
- So?

28:06.633 --> 28:09.761
I just think it's a little unusual.

28:10.771 --> 28:13.740
Look, he's a perfectly healthy boy.

28:14.374 --> 28:20.472
I mean, we have nothing to worry about
with him. Not physically or otherwise.

28:25.085 --> 28:28.885
He just had a bad moment.

28:29.890 --> 28:32.381
You know, like a fright.

28:43.203 --> 28:45.569
Yes?

28:45.639 --> 28:50.804
- I'm leavin' now. Is there anything else?
- Nothing, thank you. Good night.

28:51.511 --> 28:56.813
I think the best thing to do with a bad day
like this is end it. I'm gonna go to bed.

28:56.883 --> 28:59.283
I'll be along soon.

29:36.089 --> 29:40.150
Quiet, now. This is the master of the house.

29:40.260 --> 29:42.023
- What is this?
- Sir?

29:42.095 --> 29:44.427
The dog.

29:44.498 --> 29:49.834
- Beautiful, isn't he? We found him outside.
- Who gave you permission to bring it in?

29:50.037 --> 29:54.303
I thought we could use a good watchdog, sir.
And Damien loves him.

29:56.643 --> 29:59.339
Gave you a fright, did he, sir?

30:00.313 --> 30:03.180
- Yes.
- Well, you see how good he is.

30:03.283 --> 30:09.085
As a watchdog, I mean. I think you'll be
grateful on your long trips away, sir.

30:13.960 --> 30:18.397
Mrs Baylock, we don't need a dog,

30:18.498 --> 30:21.467
and if we do, I'll pick him out myself.

30:22.602 --> 30:27.733
- Damien's taken quite a fancy to him, sir.
- Tomorrow morning you'll call the RSPCA,

30:27.874 --> 30:32.334
tell them to collect the dog
and find him another home.

30:32.412 --> 30:34.505
You understand?

30:35.782 --> 30:37.909
Sir.

30:40.420 --> 30:42.581
Come on, boy.

31:14.654 --> 31:18.249
<i>Welcome to Windsor Safari Park.</i>

31:18.358 --> 31:21.191
<i>Animal compound to your left.</i>

31:21.261 --> 31:25.527
<i>Parking, for refreshment and zoo area,
to your right.</i>

31:25.599 --> 31:31.731
<i>When driving through animal compounds,
please keep all car windows closed.</i>

31:36.243 --> 31:38.336
Thank you.

31:50.423 --> 31:52.482
Thank you.

32:26.026 --> 32:29.655
Come on, darling.
Let's go see the monkeys, OK?

32:36.002 --> 32:39.267
- Good morning, Horton.
- Good morning, sir.

33:17.310 --> 33:21.371
<i>Baboons bite. Keep all car windows closed.</i>

33:22.849 --> 33:25.249
<i>Keep all car windows closed.</i>

33:26.186 --> 33:28.677
<i>Baboons are dangerous.</i>

34:14.734 --> 34:16.167
Oh, no.

34:55.641 --> 34:57.735
- All right, Kathy?
- Yeah.

35:00.413 --> 35:03.280
You're so silent this evening.

35:03.883 --> 35:06.613
Just tired, I guess. Sorry.

35:07.821 --> 35:09.482
- Damien all right?
- Yeah.

35:09.589 --> 35:11.648
- You sure?
- Yes.

35:17.864 --> 35:24.394
If there were anything wrong,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

35:24.471 --> 35:30.876
Wrong? What could be wrong with our child,
Robert? We're beautiful people, aren't we?

35:30.977 --> 35:34.174
There is something wrong, isn't there?

35:36.983 --> 35:39.281
Kathy.

35:39.386 --> 35:41.445
Is it so serious?

35:42.222 --> 35:45.055
Robert, I want...

35:45.191 --> 35:49.924
I need to see a psychiatrist. I have fears.

35:50.030 --> 35:52.396
I have such fears.

35:52.465 --> 35:55.662
What kind of fears? What kind?

35:55.735 --> 35:58.533
If I told you, you'd put me away.

35:58.638 --> 36:02.472
Kathy, I love you. I love you.

36:02.542 --> 36:05.477
Then help me. Find me a doctor.

36:05.545 --> 36:08.275
I will. Of course I will.

36:20.860 --> 36:24.261
Keep that scrum tight.
Get down low. Come on.

36:26.833 --> 36:28.926
Let it go. Let it go.

36:49.489 --> 36:51.980
Bring him down.

36:52.092 --> 36:54.185
Well done.

36:54.294 --> 36:57.525
I don't know what you're clapping for.
You just lost a bet.

36:57.597 --> 37:01.727
- That's right. 27-3?
- Right. That'll be three quid.

37:01.801 --> 37:05.601
- I thought it was two.
- Inflation. Haven't you heard, old boy?

37:05.705 --> 37:07.935
Well done, George. Great stuff.

37:08.007 --> 37:10.498
It was a good game.

37:10.577 --> 37:12.704
Go and have a quick drink with the lads.

37:12.779 --> 37:16.306
That'll give me time
to make sure everything's set up.

37:16.382 --> 37:21.513
Tomorrow, half past two, Bishop's Park.
Five minutes and you'll never see me again.

37:21.588 --> 37:25.490
Your wife is in danger.
She'll die unless you come.

37:45.945 --> 37:48.004
Father.

37:48.848 --> 37:50.941
Thanks again.

39:29.882 --> 39:33.010
Get on with it. Say what you have to say.

39:35.021 --> 39:40.926
"When the Jews return to Zion,
and a comet rips the sky,

39:41.027 --> 39:46.863
and the Holy Roman Empire rises,
then you and I must die."

39:47.967 --> 39:52.301
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore,

39:52.438 --> 39:58.172
turning man against his brother,
till man exists no more."

39:59.379 --> 40:03.475
- The Book of Revelations predicted it all.
- I'm not here to listen to a sermon.

40:03.549 --> 40:07.246
"It is by means of a human personality
entirely in his possession

40:07.320 --> 40:10.721
that Satan will wage
his last and formidable offense."

40:10.790 --> 40:14.385
- You said that my wife...
- Go to the town of Megiddo

40:14.494 --> 40:16.962
in the old city of Jezreel.

40:17.797 --> 40:20.766
There, see the old man Bugenhagen.

40:22.135 --> 40:25.662
- He alone can say how the child must die.
- Look here...

40:25.738 --> 40:28.206
"He who will not be saved by the lamb
will be torn by the beast."

40:28.308 --> 40:30.299
Will you stop?

40:36.749 --> 40:41.413
I'm here because you said
my wife is in danger.

40:43.489 --> 40:45.923
She is pregnant.

40:45.992 --> 40:51.328
- You're mistaken. That's nonsense.
- He will not allow the child to be born.

40:51.431 --> 40:55.424
- He will kill it while it slumbers in the womb.
- What are you talking about?

40:55.535 --> 40:57.901
Your son, Mr Thorn.

40:57.970 --> 41:00.495
The son of the devil.

41:01.140 --> 41:05.304
He will kill the unborn child,
then he will kill your wife,

41:06.646 --> 41:11.948
and when he is certain to inherit all that
is yours, then, Mr Thorn, he will kill you.

41:12.018 --> 41:13.110
That's enough!

41:13.186 --> 41:16.815
With your power, he will establish
his counterfeit kingdom here,

41:16.923 --> 41:19.721
receiving his power directly from Satan.

41:20.827 --> 41:23.819
- You're insane.
- He must die, Mr Thorn.

41:23.930 --> 41:27.263
You asked for five minutes,
and you've got five minutes.

41:27.367 --> 41:32.134
Go to the city of Megiddo.
See Bugenhagen before it's too late.

41:33.940 --> 41:35.999
Now, I've heard you.

41:36.075 --> 41:38.873
I want you to hear me.

41:38.978 --> 41:42.004
I never want to see you again.

41:45.184 --> 41:48.278
You'll see me in hell, Mr Thorn.

41:49.155 --> 41:52.283
There will we share out our sentence.

44:36.822 --> 44:39.120
No!

44:57.577 --> 44:59.670
Mrs Baylock.

45:01.747 --> 45:05.683
- Anything wrong?
- I just can't stand that noise.

45:07.153 --> 45:09.678
It's not all that bad.

45:09.789 --> 45:12.417
- Good morning, Damien.
- Good morning, Daddy.

45:12.491 --> 45:14.982
- What are we gonna do?
- Hold my hands.

45:15.061 --> 45:17.256
- Right.
- Mrs Baylock.

45:17.363 --> 45:19.422
Yes, ma'am?

45:19.999 --> 45:23.298
- Would you take him out of here, please?
- He's only playing.

45:23.402 --> 45:26.269
Would you just get him out of here, please?

45:28.474 --> 45:30.567
Yes, ma'am.

45:34.380 --> 45:37.315
Come along, Damien. Excuse me, sir.

45:47.727 --> 45:49.820
Come along.

45:55.001 --> 45:58.437
Darling, I don't know
what's the matter with me. I just...

45:58.504 --> 46:01.530
I just don't seem to be able to...

46:01.641 --> 46:04.132
I don't know.

46:18.424 --> 46:20.483
Kathy, I love you.

46:21.360 --> 46:24.921
If this is what the doctor's doing to you,

46:25.031 --> 46:28.467
don't you think it's time
I had a talk with him?

46:28.534 --> 46:30.627
Yes, you should.

46:31.470 --> 46:34.564
There's something
he wants to talk to you about, anyway.

46:34.674 --> 46:36.767
Oh?

46:37.777 --> 46:41.873
Robert, I don't ever
want to have any more children.

46:47.920 --> 46:49.979
All right.

46:52.692 --> 46:55.490
Then you'll agree to an abortion?

46:58.497 --> 47:02.331
I'm pregnant, Robert.
I just found out this morning.

47:23.956 --> 47:26.220
Yes?

47:26.325 --> 47:28.418
Yes, this is he.

47:28.527 --> 47:30.222
Who?

47:30.329 --> 47:32.388
Who? But...

47:34.567 --> 47:36.034
Hello?

47:36.635 --> 47:38.728
Hello?

47:43.109 --> 47:45.907
Something about the newspapers.

48:00.760 --> 48:03.524
Well, she knew how much you wanted one.

48:03.596 --> 48:09.398
Now she can't cope. She searches for reasons
that won't make her feel inadequate.

48:09.468 --> 48:12.130
She has these fantasies.

48:12.204 --> 48:17.972
She fantasises that your child is alien
and that your child is evil.

48:18.043 --> 48:20.739
She thinks that the child is evil?

48:20.846 --> 48:25.283
The point is, at this time,
another child would be disastrous.

48:27.853 --> 48:30.219
Well, in what way evil?

48:30.289 --> 48:35.056
Now, this is just fantasy.
She also thinks the child isn't hers.

48:50.209 --> 48:53.645
The most important thing for you to do
is to agree to an abortion.

48:53.712 --> 48:55.805
No.

48:57.516 --> 49:00.246
I'd like to know your reason.

49:04.056 --> 49:10.120
It was foretold that
this pregnancy would be terminated.

49:10.229 --> 49:13.323
I'm going to fight to see that it's not.

49:20.706 --> 49:23.106
- Forgive me, Doctor.
- Please don't leave.

49:23.209 --> 49:25.677
I'm sorry. I must get home.

51:12.117 --> 51:13.846
Damien.

51:16.255 --> 51:18.655
No, no, no, no!

51:18.857 --> 51:20.722
No! No!

52:00.693 --> 52:04.185
Are there any developments
on the state of your wife, sir?

52:06.499 --> 52:10.799
- How is your wife, Mr Ambassador?
- Is there any news, sir?

52:14.707 --> 52:16.800
- Ambassador Thorn?
- Yes. Doctor?

52:16.876 --> 52:19.208
My name is Becker.

52:19.278 --> 52:22.008
Is she all right?

52:22.114 --> 52:24.446
Well, she will recover.

52:24.517 --> 52:27.611
She's in there. Bed by the window.

52:33.225 --> 52:36.490
She has a concussion
and a broken humerus,

52:36.595 --> 52:39.826
and, well, some internal bleeding.

52:44.103 --> 52:46.799
- Internal bleeding?
- Yes.

52:48.808 --> 52:51.402
But she's pregnant.

52:51.477 --> 52:52.944
No.

52:55.347 --> 52:58.282
- She's lost it?
- Afraid so.

53:05.725 --> 53:11.493
You know, you've got a lot to be grateful for.
She's still alive.

53:11.564 --> 53:15.660
And, with proper care,
she can still have children.

54:03.816 --> 54:05.909
Robert.

54:07.319 --> 54:09.378
Robert.

54:15.528 --> 54:18.224
Don't let him kill me.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.730
Don't let him kill me.

54:30.342 --> 54:31.775
Kathy.

54:50.129 --> 54:52.222
It's all right.

56:45.144 --> 56:49.774
<i>- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you, Ambassador Thorn.</i>

56:49.882 --> 56:53.374
- Who is this?
- My name is Keith Jennings, sir.

56:53.485 --> 56:55.783
The photographer
whose camera got smashed.

56:55.888 --> 56:58.686
Would it be possible
to have a word with you at my flat?

56:58.757 --> 57:03.592
- If it's about the camera...
- No, it's not about the camera.

57:03.696 --> 57:06.597
It's about you, Mr Thorn.

57:06.699 --> 57:09.497
And the death of the priest.

57:11.804 --> 57:13.169
Go on.

57:19.278 --> 57:21.508
Do you notice anything unusual?

57:23.949 --> 57:25.541
No. Sorry.

57:26.585 --> 57:30.487
At first I thought
this was just a fault in the film.

57:34.927 --> 57:37.327
A strange coincidence.

57:44.503 --> 57:47.165
Then it happened again.

57:47.973 --> 57:50.840
Interesting, don't you think?

57:52.244 --> 57:56.772
And this, I took on the day
that you were at the rugby match.

57:56.849 --> 57:59.409
- Same thing?
- Only it's more pronounced

57:59.518 --> 58:03.147
and it's actually
making contact with the body.

58:05.724 --> 58:09.057
The rest, of course - history.

58:09.161 --> 58:11.220
I can't explain it.

58:14.967 --> 58:21.600
That's why I started digging. The coroner's
report shows that he was riddled with cancer.

58:21.673 --> 58:25.871
High on morphine most of the time.
Injected himself two or three times a day.

58:25.978 --> 58:29.573
- He knew that he was dying?
- Apparently, yes.

58:31.850 --> 58:35.547
He said that he wanted
to be forgiven by Christ.

58:37.256 --> 58:43.593
Externally, his body was normal, except for
one thing on the inside of his right thigh.

58:43.662 --> 58:46.495
- What is it?
- Three sixes.

58:48.033 --> 58:50.001
Six hundred and sixty-six.

58:52.404 --> 58:55.840
- Concentration camp?
- That's what I thought.

58:55.908 --> 59:02.245
But the biopsy says it's a birthmark.
The best is yet to come.

59:12.925 --> 59:15.655
Pages of the Bible. Thousands of 'em.

59:15.727 --> 59:19.686
Every inch of wall-space covered,
even the windows.

59:22.835 --> 59:25.998
He even needed to be close to his church.

59:30.676 --> 59:33.144
There are 47. I counted them.

59:34.046 --> 59:37.345
I think he was trying
to keep something out, don't you?

59:39.051 --> 59:45.115
The police thought he was insane. They let
me come here to see if I could find anything.

59:49.094 --> 59:53.053
The first item is a diary.

59:56.668 --> 59:58.863
It didn't say anything about him.

59:58.937 --> 01:00:02.634
It's about you. What time
you left the house, where you went,

01:00:02.708 --> 01:00:07.338
what restaurants you had your lunch in,
what time your speaking engagements were.

01:00:07.446 --> 01:00:12.679
The last entry says that he was supposed to
have met you in Bishop's Park.

01:00:12.751 --> 01:00:15.549
And that was dated the day he died.

01:00:17.523 --> 01:00:23.655
The important items are here. If we're to get
to the bottom of this, we've got to start here.

01:00:25.364 --> 01:00:30.700
<i>This first clipping
is from the Astrologer's Monthly.</i>

01:00:30.769 --> 01:00:36.765
Reports an unusual phenomenon. A comet
changed its shape into a glowing star,

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:39.571
like the star of Bethlehem 2,000 years ago.

01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:45.139
This one was on the other side of the world,
the European continent, five years ago.

01:00:46.552 --> 01:00:49.988
6 June, to be exact.

01:00:50.088 --> 01:00:53.148
Does that date mean anything to you?

01:00:53.225 --> 01:00:55.159
Yes.

01:00:55.227 --> 01:00:58.594
Then you'll recollect this other clipping.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:02.690
It's a birth announcement
from a Rome newspaper.

01:01:02.768 --> 01:01:06.169
Also dated 6 June, five years ago.

01:01:06.238 --> 01:01:08.832
The day your son was born.

01:01:08.941 --> 01:01:11.967
The sixth month, sixth day.

01:01:14.813 --> 01:01:17.509
Was your son born at 6am?

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:24.713
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to work out
this birthmark. The three sixes.

01:01:28.594 --> 01:01:30.858
My son is dead.

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:37.532
I don't know whose son I'm raising.

01:01:40.272 --> 01:01:44.606
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to help you try and find out.

01:01:44.676 --> 01:01:48.203
No. It's my problem.

01:01:51.216 --> 01:01:54.652
No, sir, you're wrong. It's my problem too.

01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:02.820
When I came here with the police,
I took some photographs.

01:02:02.894 --> 01:02:07.490
I happened to catch sight
of my own reflection in that mirror.

01:02:22.047 --> 01:02:26.381
I know you must think I'm crazy,
but I'm so frightened.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:31.855
Don't be afraid. You'll be all right here.
You'll be perfectly all right.

01:02:36.928 --> 01:02:39.021
Some all right!

01:02:40.032 --> 01:02:43.468
- What about Damien?
- I'll speak to Mrs Horton.

01:02:43.535 --> 01:02:46.265
She'll look after him.

01:02:51.877 --> 01:02:53.936
Mrs Horton?

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.684
- Mrs Baylock.
- Sir.

01:03:00.752 --> 01:03:03.448
- Where's Mrs Horton?
- Gone.

01:03:04.523 --> 01:03:08.015
- Gone out?
- No, they've gone. They just got up and went.

01:03:08.093 --> 01:03:12.496
They left an address for you
to send their last month's wages to.

01:03:12.564 --> 01:03:18.434
Well, didn't Mrs Horton say anything?
Didn't Horton leave any explanation?

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:21.700
No. But don't worry, sir. I can manage.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:35.515
- I'll look into this when I get back.
- Just as you wish, sir.

01:03:35.587 --> 01:03:37.851
- And Mrs Baylock?
- Sir?

01:03:37.923 --> 01:03:41.654
Last night, I saw that dog in Damien's room.
I clearly told you...

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.719
He's gone now, sir.
They took him away this morning.

01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:25.567
No.

01:04:30.175 --> 01:04:33.110
This is the right address.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:47.219
Apparently, there was a terrible fire
and the old hospital burned down.

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:53.962
Five years ago.

01:04:58.403 --> 01:05:00.462
OK.

01:05:11.149 --> 01:05:15.483
But surely the fire didn't destroy everything.
There must have been some records.

01:05:16.888 --> 01:05:20.483
I sorry. I think everything was destroyed.

01:05:20.592 --> 01:05:23.755
Isn't it possible
there were some papers stored elsewhere?

01:05:23.862 --> 01:05:26.160
- I do not know.
- Sister.

01:05:27.466 --> 01:05:30.060
This is most important to me.

01:05:30.168 --> 01:05:33.763
I adopted a child here.
I'm searching for some records of it...

01:05:33.872 --> 01:05:36.898
- There were no adoptions here.
- There was one.

01:05:37.008 --> 01:05:39.977
<i>- No, signore.
- It wasn't an actual adoption.</i>

01:05:40.111 --> 01:05:42.636
- You are mistake.
- Wait.

01:05:42.714 --> 01:05:47.583
Birth records.
If I gave you a date. An exact date.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:51.588
It's no use. The fire started
in the hall of records in the basement.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:54.591
All the paperwork was there.
Went up like a torch.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:57.924
Shot up the stairwells.
The third floor became an inferno.

01:05:58.029 --> 01:06:01.863
- The third floor?
- The maternity wards. Nothing left but ashes.

01:06:01.933 --> 01:06:05.425
- You will excuse me?
- What about the staff?

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:08.200
<i>- Surely some survived.
- Sì, some.</i>

01:06:08.273 --> 01:06:11.242
There was a tall man, a priest.

01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:14.107
Dark eyes. Piercing eyes.

01:06:16.715 --> 01:06:17.704
Yes.

01:06:17.816 --> 01:06:20.944
<i>- He was principale.
- Yes, he was in charge. Is he...</i>

01:06:21.052 --> 01:06:23.213
- Yes, he is alive.
- Is he here?

01:06:23.288 --> 01:06:24.482
- No.
- Where?

01:06:24.556 --> 01:06:28.424
<i>He's in a monastero in Frosinone.</i>

01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:33.027
Many were taken there. Many die.

01:06:33.098 --> 01:06:36.761
Perhaps he is die since,
but he lived through the fire.

01:06:37.335 --> 01:06:40.099
<i>I remember people say it was un miracolo.</i>

01:06:40.772 --> 01:06:42.899
Frosinone?

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:14.705
- Here we are.
- What is it?

01:07:14.773 --> 01:07:17.708
- "When the Jews return to Zion..."
- That's the poem.

01:07:17.776 --> 01:07:20.370
"When the Jews return to Zion..."

01:07:20.478 --> 01:07:23.538
And there was something about a comet.

01:07:23.615 --> 01:07:27.881
Yes, that's here too. "The shower of stars
and the rise of the Roman Empire."

01:07:27.986 --> 01:07:32.423
These are supposed to be the events
that signal the birth of the Antichrist.

01:07:32.524 --> 01:07:34.583
The devil's child.

01:07:39.965 --> 01:07:45.767
It's making more sense. The Jews have
returned to Zion and there has been a comet.

01:07:45.837 --> 01:07:48.135
As for the rise of the Roman Empire,

01:07:48.206 --> 01:07:52.609
scholars think that could well mean
the Common Market, the Treaty of Rome.

01:07:52.711 --> 01:07:56.408
- Bit of a stretch.
- What about this? In Revelations it says:

01:07:56.514 --> 01:08:00.507
- "He shall rise from the eternal sea."
- That's the poem again.

01:08:00.585 --> 01:08:04.453
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore."

01:08:04.556 --> 01:08:08.014
- That was the beginning of it.
- Theologians have interpreted

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:11.618
the "eternal sea"
as meaning the world of politics,

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:16.189
the sea that constantly rages
with turmoil and revolution.

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:22.064
So the devil's child will rise
from the world of politics.

01:08:43.495 --> 01:08:45.962
Looks like this is as far as we go.

01:08:46.064 --> 01:08:48.157
Let's have a look.

01:10:15.386 --> 01:10:17.479
Found him?

01:10:36.307 --> 01:10:41.074
His mind is active,
but since the fire he's not made a sound.

01:10:41.179 --> 01:10:43.704
We feed him and take care of his needs.

01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:47.343
And we pray for his recovery
when his penance is completed.

01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:48.908
What penance?

01:10:48.987 --> 01:10:51.922
"Woe to the shepherd
who abandons his sheep."

01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:55.153
"May his right arm wither
and his right eye lose its sight."

01:10:55.226 --> 01:10:58.093
He's fallen from grace. Can you tell us why?

01:10:58.196 --> 01:11:00.289
For abandoning Christ.

01:11:00.365 --> 01:11:03.528
- How do you know he's abandoned Christ?
- He told us.

01:11:03.601 --> 01:11:07.628
- But he doesn't speak.
- There is some movement in his left hand.

01:11:07.739 --> 01:11:10.435
He was able to write it down.

01:11:14.546 --> 01:11:17.515
You will notice the curved line over the head.

01:11:17.582 --> 01:11:21.609
This indicates the hood of the monk.
His own hood.

01:11:21.719 --> 01:11:24.950
- The three sixes.
- Six is the sign of the devil.

01:11:25.023 --> 01:11:29.722
- But why three of them?
- We believe it signifies the diabolical trinity.

01:11:29.794 --> 01:11:35.630
- The devil, Antichrist and false prophet.
- Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

01:11:35.733 --> 01:11:41.797
For everything holy, there is something
unholy. This is the essence of temptation.

01:11:47.378 --> 01:11:50.870
Father Spiletto, my name is Thorn.

01:11:53.751 --> 01:11:57.744
There was a child.
I want to know where that child came from.

01:11:57.822 --> 01:12:02.259
- I am afraid that...
- You confessed to them. Now confess to me.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.193
<i>- What happened?
- Please, signore.</i>

01:12:05.263 --> 01:12:08.790
You said you knew its mother.
Where is she now?

01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:13.998
- I must insist that you do not...
- I beg you, where is she?

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:17.606
Answer me.

01:12:17.809 --> 01:12:19.071
Answer.

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:33.281
Excuse me.

01:13:26.678 --> 01:13:28.737
Cervet.

01:13:31.649 --> 01:13:35.949
Please, does it mean something to you?

01:13:36.587 --> 01:13:38.851
Cerveteri.

01:13:38.923 --> 01:13:41.915
It is an old cemetery from Etruscan times.

01:13:41.993 --> 01:13:44.757
Cripta Sant'Angelo.

01:13:44.862 --> 01:13:49.322
- It is nothing but ruins.
- Where is this place?

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:52.995
- But there is nothing there. Only graves.
- Where is it?

01:13:54.405 --> 01:13:58.307
You will find it on the map.
It is perhaps 50km north of Rome.

01:17:10.401 --> 01:17:12.528
Robert, over here.

01:17:25.616 --> 01:17:28.141
Maria Scianna.

01:17:28.219 --> 01:17:30.312
My God.

01:17:31.722 --> 01:17:34.384
June 6.

01:17:36.727 --> 01:17:38.786
Five years ago.

01:17:40.631 --> 01:17:43.191
Bambino Scianna.

01:17:43.301 --> 01:17:45.792
Infant boy. Same date.

01:17:53.611 --> 01:17:57.945
"In birth and death,
the generations embrace."

01:18:02.753 --> 01:18:06.621
Is my son buried here?

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.758
This woman could be
the mother of the child you adopted.

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:18.763
Why here in this terrible place?

01:18:41.192 --> 01:18:43.820
- No.
- Oh, my God.

01:18:57.041 --> 01:19:00.306
- The other one.
- No. Let's get out of here.

01:19:01.812 --> 01:19:04.280
If it's an animal too,

01:19:05.249 --> 01:19:08.912
then maybe my child

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:14.015
is alive somewhere.

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:28.469
They murdered him.

01:19:28.539 --> 01:19:32.100
They murdered him as soon as he was born.

01:19:35.946 --> 01:19:38.039
Murderers.

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:40.908
Murderers.

01:19:53.531 --> 01:19:55.658
Come on.

01:19:56.067 --> 01:19:58.535
Robert.

01:20:11.549 --> 01:20:15.076
Don't run. It's only the smell of the graves.

01:20:26.063 --> 01:20:28.054
Run.

01:20:29.333 --> 01:20:30.891
Robert.

01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:42.827
- Hello?
- Hello.

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.993
Kathy?

01:22:46.103 --> 01:22:49.937
<i>Hello, Robert. Is that you?
I'm so glad you called.</i>

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:55.501
Kathy, darling.
Now, listen to me very carefully.

01:22:55.613 --> 01:22:57.740
Do just what I say.

01:22:57.882 --> 01:23:01.249
I want you to leave London right now.

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:06.516
<i>- What do you mean, leave London, darling?
- I've put through a call to the embassy.</i>

01:23:06.624 --> 01:23:11.857
Tom Portman will meet you at the hospital
and bring you here to Rome.

01:23:11.929 --> 01:23:15.729
<i>- Robert, what's happened? What's wrong?
- Please, darling. Just do it.</i>

01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:18.334
<i>Get ready to leave.</i>

01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:24.669
- Robert, I don't think I can move very well.
- Kathy, do it.

01:23:24.975 --> 01:23:30.311
OK. Yes, all right, I'll try to be ready
by the time he gets here.

01:23:30.381 --> 01:23:32.474
<i>All right, darling.</i>

01:24:11.589 --> 01:24:14.422
Who is that? Is that somebody there?

01:24:14.525 --> 01:24:17.016
Tom? Is that you?

01:25:11.615 --> 01:25:13.674
Yes?

01:25:14.551 --> 01:25:16.610
Yes, this is he.

01:25:20.057 --> 01:25:22.150
Tom?

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.859
Kathy?

01:25:38.976 --> 01:25:41.035
Tom,

01:25:42.212 --> 01:25:45.443
I can't talk now.

01:26:40.104 --> 01:26:42.163
Robert.

01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:46.034
I found out about the town of Megiddo.

01:26:49.179 --> 01:26:52.512
It's derived from the word "Armageddon".

01:26:54.118 --> 01:26:57.178
The end of the world.

01:26:57.287 --> 01:27:00.256
It's underground,
about 60 miles south of Jerusalem.

01:27:00.324 --> 01:27:03.555
There's some excavation going on there.

01:27:05.195 --> 01:27:08.926
If only you could remember the name
of the man you're supposed to see.

01:27:09.066 --> 01:27:11.125
It's Bugenhagen.

01:27:11.969 --> 01:27:14.733
He was an exorcist. I read about him.

01:27:15.405 --> 01:27:19.364
That was his name.
And I remember the poem.

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:22.908
"When the Jews return to Zion,

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:25.744
and a comet fills the sky

01:27:25.816 --> 01:27:29.343
and the Holy Roman Empire rises,

01:27:29.419 --> 01:27:31.910
then you and I must die."

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:37.753
"From the eternal sea he rises,

01:27:37.828 --> 01:27:40.820
creating armies on either shore

01:27:41.832 --> 01:27:44.995
turning man against his brother

01:27:46.770 --> 01:27:50.501
till man exists no more."

01:27:56.647 --> 01:27:59.172
Kathy is dead.

01:28:01.618 --> 01:28:04.348
I want Damien to die, too.

01:28:59.910 --> 01:29:02.378
Hello, Mr Thorn.

01:29:02.446 --> 01:29:04.914
I am Bugenhagen.

01:29:05.015 --> 01:29:08.974
- What is this place?
- The city of Jezreel.

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:12.888
Town of Megiddo.

01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:18.650
The place where Christianity began.

01:29:20.797 --> 01:29:24.460
The little priest - is he dead yet?

01:29:25.302 --> 01:29:27.202
Yes.

01:29:29.907 --> 01:29:32.000
Yes.

01:29:35.812 --> 01:29:39.714
Come along, Mr Thorn.
We had better get to work.

01:29:49.559 --> 01:29:52.050
You will excuse us.

01:29:52.963 --> 01:29:55.898
This is for Mr Thorn alone.

01:29:57.768 --> 01:29:59.861
All right.

01:30:53.991 --> 01:30:57.825
It must be done on hallowed ground.

01:30:59.763 --> 01:31:02.197
A church.

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:05.927
His blood must be spilled on the altar of God.

01:31:09.439 --> 01:31:13.535
This first knife is most important.

01:31:15.912 --> 01:31:22.010
It extinguishes physical life
and forms the center of the cross.

01:31:24.054 --> 01:31:29.014
The subsequent placings
extinguish spiritual life

01:31:29.126 --> 01:31:32.527
and should radiate outward.

01:31:32.596 --> 01:31:34.655
Like this.

01:31:37.634 --> 01:31:43.630
This is not a human child. Make no mistake.

01:31:53.016 --> 01:31:55.746
- Is there proof?
- Oh, yes.

01:31:56.787 --> 01:31:59.221
He bears a birthmark.

01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:02.990
A sequence of sixes.

01:32:03.493 --> 01:32:06.985
So, says the Bible,
do all the apostles of Satan.

01:32:08.799 --> 01:32:12.098
- He doesn't have it.
- He must have it.

01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:16.171
I've bathed him. I know every inch of him.

01:32:17.474 --> 01:32:23.106
If it is not visible on the body,
it will be beneath the hair.

01:32:24.981 --> 01:32:27.643
Remove it.

01:32:28.185 --> 01:32:31.382
You must be devoid of pity.

01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:39.053
- And the woman?
- She is an apostate of hell.

01:32:39.129 --> 01:32:42.428
She will die before permitting this.

01:32:50.507 --> 01:32:56.468
Look, I want to know what he said.
I've a right to know.

01:32:56.646 --> 01:33:01.276
Robert, I want to know what he said.
Look, I'm notjust some bystander.

01:33:01.418 --> 01:33:05.445
- I was the one that found him.
- I'm the one that's supposed to kill him.

01:33:05.522 --> 01:33:09.458
These are knives. He wants me to stab him.

01:33:09.526 --> 01:33:12.654
- Wants me to murder a child.
- It's not a child.

01:33:12.729 --> 01:33:15.527
How can he know that? Maybe he's wrong.

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:20.831
It's insane. I won't have anything
to do with murdering a little boy.

01:33:20.904 --> 01:33:23.873
He's not responsible. I won't do it.

01:33:32.082 --> 01:33:34.915
Well, if you don't do it, I will.

01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:13.540
No!

01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:36.758
Run, Damien. Run. Run.

01:42:05.294 --> 01:42:07.387
No!

01:44:22.899 --> 01:44:23.957
Hold it.

01:44:27.503 --> 01:44:31.496
<i>- Panda Four to control.

01:44:31.574 --> 01:44:36.534

Heading north. Seven Hills Road. Over.

01:44:45.221 --> 01:44:47.655
Al. We've got a shout.

01:44:47.757 --> 01:44:49.816
I'll be back later, all right?

01:44:52.128 --> 01:44:55.461
<i>MP to Zulu Seven.
You are requested assist Panda Four</i>

01:44:55.565 --> 01:44:58.659
<i>in pursuit of white estate car,

01:46:21.083 --> 01:46:24.052
No! Please, Daddy, no!

01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:28.454
- No, Daddy. No!
- God help me.

01:46:28.858 --> 01:46:32.089
Police! Drop. Drop, or I'll fire.

01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:51.041
And so to their final rest do we commit
these two and entrust them unto our Lord.

01:46:52.481 --> 01:46:57.578
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

01:46:58.387 --> 01:47:00.480
Detail, attention.

01:47:01.524 --> 01:47:03.583
Present arms.

01:47:07.496 --> 01:47:10.090
Ready, aim, fire.

01:47:11.968 --> 01:47:14.334
Ready, aim, fire.

01:47:16.372 --> 01:47:18.772
Ready, aim, fire.

01:48:15.398 --> 01:48:19.960
Excuse me, Mr President. When you're ready
to leave, your car is over there.

01:48:20.036 --> 01:48:22.368
- In a moment.
- Yes, sir.
