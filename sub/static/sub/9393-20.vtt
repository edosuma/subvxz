that all you see P

00:05.088 --> 12:30.730

00:08.216 --> 12:33.858
P But where are those
good old-fashioned values P

00:11.970 --> 12:37.612
P On which we used to rely?

00:14.973 --> 12:40.615
P Lucky there's a family guy

P Lucky there's a man

Das Ist Gut.

00:38.038 --> 13:03.680
Dad, what is this show?

00:39.164 --> 13:04.806
I don't know. It's just
a German guy listing items

00:41.917 --> 13:07.559
and then declaring them good.

00:43.668 --> 13:09.310
Wilkommen! Where are we?

00:46.171 --> 13:11.813
AUDIENCE:
Das! Ist! Gut!

ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt this program

01:19.037 --> 13:44.679
to bring you a Channel Five News
special report.

01:21.414 --> 13:47.056
Good evening. I'm Joyce Kinney
with this special report.

01:24.042 --> 13:49.684
The latest police
statistics have revealed

01:26.044 --> 13:51.686
a significant rise in
crime throughout Quahog.

01:28.004 --> 13:53.646
That's right, Joyce.

01:29.381 --> 13:55.023
And just to put it out there,
Tom Tucker is packin'.

01:33.051 --> 13:58.693
I drive a 2006 Infiniti,
and I don't intend to lose it.

01:36.054 --> 14:01.696
So come and get some, punks.

01:38.056 --> 14:03.698
An increase
in crime?

01:39.432 --> 14:05.074
That can't
be right.

01:40.809 --> 14:06.451
I haven't noticed
anything like that.

01:42.561 --> 14:08.203
You're in the house 14 hours
a day. What would you notice?

01:45.564 --> 14:11.206
Well, I hate to
admit it, Lois,

01:46.690 --> 14:12.332
but over the last
couple of years,

01:48.066 --> 14:13.708
this town has changed a lot, and
not necessarily for the better.

01:50.694 --> 14:16.336
Yeah, I mean, the other day,
I left a doodie

01:52.612 --> 14:18.254
right in the middle
of a Crate and Barrel.

01:54.364 --> 14:20.006
Came back 45 minutes later,
it was gone.

01:56.449 --> 14:22.091
Yeah, even school's
getting more dangerous.

01:58.243 --> 14:23.885
The bullies
have been so busy,

02:00.078 --> 14:25.720
they're outsourcing
their bullying to India.

02:02.872 --> 14:28.514
MAN (Indian accent):
Okay, do you see

02:03.999 --> 14:29.641
the back of your underwear
in the mirror?

02:05.584 --> 14:31.226
Yes.

02:06.960 --> 14:32.602
Okay, I want you to pull it up
as high as you can.

02:08.962 --> 14:34.604
Well, I disagree
with you guys.

02:10.380 --> 14:36.022
I think Quahog
is still pretty great.

02:12.090 --> 14:37.732
You know, it's hard for me

02:13.633 --> 14:39.275
to take the things
you say seriously

02:15.135 --> 14:40.777
when I know what's been
in that mouth of yours.

02:17.262 --> 14:42.904
Look, I realize Quahog isn't
the small town it used to be,

02:20.140 --> 14:45.782
but it's still
very special to me.

02:21.766 --> 14:47.408
It's my home.

02:23.268 --> 14:48.910
Yeah, come on, guys, she's got
dyed roots in this community.

02:26.021 --> 14:51.663
Lois, I know you
love this town,

02:27.731 --> 14:53.373
but nothing is ever as
innocent as it seems.

02:33.987 --> 14:59.629
(grunts)

02:35.655 --> 15:01.297
Attaboy, Ope.

02:41.244 --> 15:06.886
(crickets chirping)

02:42.412 --> 15:08.054
Give me all
your money!

02:44.539 --> 15:10.181
Okay, okay!

02:46.041 --> 15:11.683
You have a white wallet?

02:47.626 --> 15:13.268
Yeah, just like
Truman Capote.

02:49.127 --> 15:14.769
Who's Truman Capote?

02:50.295 --> 15:15.937
What a surprise!

02:51.921 --> 15:17.563
The mugger's never
heard of Truman Capote.

02:54.799 --> 15:20.441
There's a library card in there!
Use it!

02:57.552 --> 15:23.194
(crowd chattering,
seals squeaking)

03:00.138 --> 15:25.780
And now, let's meet our star!

03:02.682 --> 15:28.324
Give a warm Quahog Oceanland
welcome to Bojangles!

03:06.811 --> 15:32.453
All the fish
in the bucket now!

03:08.813 --> 15:34.455
Not one fish at a time
as a reward! All of them!

03:12.025 --> 15:37.667
Okay, okay,
take it easy.

03:13.026 --> 15:38.668
Okay, the one thing

03:14.277 --> 15:39.919
you don't want to do
is tell me to take it easy.

03:17.072 --> 15:42.714
Now do that thing
where you rub my belly!

03:19.199 --> 15:44.841
I really like that!

03:20.950 --> 15:46.592
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

03:24.162 --> 15:49.804
Yeah, now I'm gonna balance
a ball on your face.

03:29.834 --> 15:55.476
One more push.

03:31.044 --> 15:56.686
(groans)

03:32.045 --> 15:57.687
There we go!
It's a boy!

03:33.588 --> 15:59.230
And he's got a gun!

03:35.048 --> 16:00.690
(two gunshots)

03:37.967 --> 16:03.609
(crying)

03:45.058 --> 16:10.700
Well, you guys,
we did it.

03:46.476 --> 16:12.118
We finally went to a restaurant
without somebody yelling at us,

03:48.978 --> 16:14.620
and then the rest of the place
applauding them.

03:53.191 --> 16:18.833
(all gasp)

03:54.693 --> 16:20.335
Oh, my God!

03:56.611 --> 16:22.253
We've been
burglarized!

03:58.113 --> 16:23.755
to get that $17 insurance check
and start over.

04:02.200 --> 16:27.842
Oh, my God,
it's so creepy to think

04:04.077 --> 16:29.719
there were strangers
in our house.

04:05.704 --> 16:31.346
I've never
felt so scared.

04:07.080 --> 16:32.722
I have.

04:10.834 --> 16:36.476
And now we wait.

04:14.045 --> 16:39.687
Oh, no, they took my gym shoes.

04:16.172 --> 16:41.814
Sorry, glutes,
no blasting today.

04:18.717 --> 16:44.359
They took my dirty rope
that was tied in a knot!

04:21.344 --> 16:46.986
They stole the chair
I use in the shower!

04:23.722 --> 16:49.364
They stole
all my pens!

04:26.057 --> 16:51.699
I... I don't have
a lot of stuff.

04:29.227 --> 16:54.869
They also stole
my sense of wonder.

04:32.439 --> 16:58.081
(birds chirping)

04:33.732 --> 16:59.374
Nope.

04:34.941 --> 17:00.583
Oh, this is horrible!

04:36.985 --> 17:02.627
Maybe you guys were right.

04:38.194 --> 17:03.836
Maybe our town has changed.

04:40.697 --> 17:06.339
I know, it's awful.

04:41.948 --> 17:07.590
Pretty soon, guys are
just gonna be showing

04:43.616 --> 17:09.258
their boners to babies
and stuff, I bet.

04:46.202 --> 17:11.844
It's sad to think that Quahog
isn't safe for families anymore.

04:49.456 --> 17:15.098
I mean, all lever wanted was
to raise our children

04:52.125 --> 17:17.767
in a wholesome place,
far away from all the crime

04:55.086 --> 17:20.728
and problems of the big city.

04:57.088 --> 17:22.730
I'm reading you, Lois.

04:58.631 --> 17:24.273
I'm reading you loud and clear.

05:04.137 --> 17:29.779
(doorbell rings)

05:05.764 --> 17:31.406
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.

05:07.015 --> 17:32.657
Um, I'm looking for
a wholesome place

05:08.767 --> 17:34.409
for my family to live, so
I'd like to buy your farm.

05:11.644 --> 17:37.286
All right, well,
the going rate

05:13.229 --> 17:38.871
for my farm is $875,000.

05:16.024 --> 17:41.666
Uh... nobody
called ahead?

05:17.984 --> 17:43.626
What?

05:19.652 --> 17:45.294
Well, somebody... somebody from
Fox was supposed to call ahead.

05:22.113 --> 17:47.755
They usually
take care of it,

05:23.490 --> 17:49.132
and then I just go
ahead and do stuff.

05:25.408 --> 17:51.050
I didn't get
no phone call.

05:26.993 --> 17:52.635
(phone ringing)

05:29.746 --> 17:55.388
Hello?

05:30.789 --> 17:56.431
Oh, yes.

05:32.165 --> 17:57.807
Yes, that'll be fine.

05:33.416 --> 17:59.058
Ah.

05:40.256 --> 18:05.898
Hey, Lois, you know
how I'm always

05:42.175 --> 18:07.817
buying things
impulsively?

05:43.426 --> 18:09.068
Well, that's gonna
be very hard to do

05:45.428 --> 18:11.070
now that we're
living on a farm.

05:47.180 --> 18:12.822
What? What are you
talking about?

05:48.932 --> 18:14.574
Um, a farm, Lois.

05:50.558 --> 18:16.200
It's where
vegetables live.

05:52.185 --> 18:17.827
Peter, you went out
and bought a farm

05:53.645 --> 18:19.287
without even talking
to me about it?

05:55.313 --> 18:20.955
Well, Lois, in my
defense, I have nothing

05:57.690 --> 18:23.332
to back up the beginning
of this sentence.

05:59.442 --> 18:25.084
I can't believe this.

06:00.777 --> 18:26.419
And it's not like
it's the first time you made

06:02.821 --> 18:28.463
a big family decision
without consulting me.

06:13.206 --> 18:38.848
(quietly): Yes, I'd like to
see your quietest doctor.

06:16.334 --> 18:41.976
Peter, where'd you
even get the money

06:18.211 --> 18:43.853
to make that kind
of purchase?

06:19.671 --> 18:45.313
I sold the house.

06:20.672 --> 18:46.314
And I did it
on Craigslist,

06:22.215 --> 18:47.857
so I also made a
dangerous friend.

06:23.842 --> 18:49.484
What? How could
you sell the house?

06:25.844 --> 18:51.486
Spooner Street is our home!

06:27.345 --> 18:52.987
I mean, I have three aprons
that say "Quahog."

06:29.848 --> 18:55.490
What do you want me to do,
start all over?

06:32.225 --> 18:57.867
Lois, you were saying
yourself how you want

06:33.810 --> 18:59.452
our kids to grow up
in a wholesome place

06:35.812 --> 19:01.454
away from the big city.

06:36.980 --> 19:02.622
I... I did say that.

06:39.065 --> 19:04.707
And, Chris, you been
telling me how you wanted

06:40.817 --> 19:06.459
to watch animals
humping other animals

06:42.068 --> 19:07.710
what might not
be okay with it.

06:43.361 --> 19:09.003
That's true.

06:44.696 --> 19:10.338
And, Meg, you yourself
said lip gloss unicorns

06:47.115 --> 19:12.757
Channing Tatum something
something bullcrap.

06:49.075 --> 19:14.717
You were listening
the whole time?

06:50.493 --> 19:16.135
Don't you see,
you guys?

06:51.870 --> 19:17.512
I did this for
the family.

06:53.079 --> 19:18.721
Just think of this farm as
our next great adventure.

06:55.498 --> 19:21.140
Like when we tried to
invade the city of Troy.

07:02.380 --> 19:28.022
Peter, I don't think
this is the right horse.

07:04.883 --> 19:30.525
I am 100% positive
this is the right horse.

07:08.094 --> 19:33.736
Come on, guys,
what do you say?

07:09.387 --> 19:35.029
Will you join me
in eating eggs

07:11.139 --> 19:36.781
fresh out of a
chicken's butt?

07:12.390 --> 19:38.032
Yay! Now I can be one
of those filthy teens

07:15.018 --> 19:40.660
with sad eyes
at a farmer's market!

07:17.854 --> 19:43.496
Well, with what's
become of Quahog,

07:19.731 --> 19:45.373
maybe it is time
to make a change.

07:21.399 --> 19:47.041
I'm in, Dad!

07:22.400 --> 19:48.042
Me, too!

07:23.401 --> 19:49.043
All right, let's do it.

07:25.028 --> 19:50.670
Hey, what's going on?

07:26.404 --> 19:52.046
Well, we've made a decision
as a family, Brian.

07:29.032 --> 19:54.674
We've decided to take you to a
nice, big farm upstate.

07:33.119 --> 19:58.761
Wh-What?

07:34.787 --> 20:00.429
A farm with big
open fields, Brian,

07:36.915 --> 20:02.557
where you can just run
and run and be free

07:39.125 --> 20:04.767
and no one will
ever hurt you.

07:41.044 --> 20:06.686
Doesn't that sound
wonderful, Brian?

07:42.921 --> 20:08.563
Are you ready to go
to the nice farm?

07:45.131 --> 20:10.773
No! No!

07:46.257 --> 20:11.899
You'll never take me alive!

07:47.675 --> 20:13.317
(grunts)

07:50.553 --> 20:16.195
Okay, I am at full
candy corn right now.

08:03.066 --> 20:28.708
(chickens clucking)

08:05.068 --> 20:30.710
Here we are, everyone.

08:06.694 --> 20:32.336
The Griffin family farm.

08:08.696 --> 20:34.338
Wow, look at us, Brian,
frontier people.

08:11.282 --> 20:36.924
Ifeel like those miners
who first struck gold

08:13.409 --> 20:39.051
in San Francisco.

08:15.828 --> 20:41.470
Oh, my God,
we did it!

08:17.121 --> 20:42.763
We struck gold!

08:18.247 --> 20:43.889
This is amazing!
We're gonna be rich!

08:20.249 --> 20:45.891
Rich and gay.

08:21.501 --> 20:47.143
Come here.

08:22.752 --> 20:48.394
(moaning)

08:24.087 --> 20:49.729
(cows mooing)

08:26.339 --> 20:51.981
Peter, what are you doing?

08:28.132 --> 20:53.774
Well, Lois, a big part
of owning a farm

08:30.134 --> 20:55.776
is crossing a road
very slowly with cows.

08:32.261 --> 20:57.903
Okay, okay, Bessie, now.

08:34.973 --> 21:00.615
Get yourself out there.
Easy does it.

08:36.766 --> 21:02.408
(tires screech, horn honking)

08:38.017 --> 21:03.659
Hey, come on, man!
I got to get to work!

08:40.979 --> 21:06.621
And so do they, sir.

08:42.772 --> 21:08.414
Hurry it up!

08:44.983 --> 21:10.625
Wait a second.

08:47.777 --> 21:13.419
Now get in line, you!

08:51.656 --> 21:17.298
Hey, I thought I told you kids
to go plow in the field.

08:54.367 --> 21:20.009
But, Dad, we've been
plowing all morning.

08:56.995 --> 21:22.637
Yeah, I can't take
any more plowing.

08:58.663 --> 21:24.305
Ican barely walk.

08:59.872 --> 21:25.514
Look, I know it seems
like dirty work, but, Chris,

09:02.125 --> 21:27.767
you got to spread that seed
until your sack is empty.

09:04.293 --> 21:29.935
And, Meg, you got to clear
away all that brush

09:06.170 --> 21:31.812
so he can plant it deep
where it needs to be.

09:08.631 --> 21:34.273
Okay, we'll keep
at it, but I think

09:10.675 --> 21:36.317
that hoe is pretty
much worn out.

09:12.385 --> 21:38.027
Well, flip it over;
you can use both sides.

09:14.679 --> 21:40.321
(kazoo plays)

09:19.183 --> 21:44.825
Peter, there's a guy
standing out in the yard.

09:21.436 --> 21:47.078
Oh, yeah, that's Larry.

09:22.812 --> 21:48.454
Part of being a farmer is having
a best friend named Larry

09:25.064 --> 21:50.706
who I spend huge
amounts of time with,

09:26.816 --> 21:52.458
but never actually talk to.

09:28.192 --> 21:53.834
P Ooh, you make me
live now, honey P

09:32.822 --> 21:58.464
P Ooh, you make me live

09:36.826 --> 22:02.468
POh

09:38.036 --> 22:03.678
P You're the best friend

09:40.538 --> 22:06.180
P That I ever had

09:43.041 --> 22:08.683
P Been with you
such a long time P

09:45.960 --> 22:11.602
P You're my sunshine

09:47.962 --> 22:13.604
P And I want you to know

09:50.840 --> 22:16.482
P That my feelings are true

09:52.842 --> 22:18.484
P I really love you.

09:55.845 --> 22:21.487
Peter, I'm dying.

09:58.222 --> 22:23.864
This is the last time
I'll ever see you.

10:00.683 --> 22:26.325
Bye.

10:06.481 --> 22:32.123
Peter, I've been running
the numbers on this farm,

10:08.608 --> 22:34.250
and we're in deep trouble.

10:10.234 --> 22:35.876
We haven't grown
a single crop to sell.

10:12.612 --> 22:38.254
And meanwhile,
you're spending half our money

10:15.114 --> 22:40.756
down at the General Store,
and the other half

10:16.741 --> 22:42.383
at the Specific Store.

10:18.367 --> 22:44.009
Do you have almonds?
What kind of almonds?

10:20.369 --> 22:46.011
Marcona almonds.
From what region?

10:22.080 --> 22:47.722
The Basque Region.

10:23.081 --> 22:48.723
The Basque Region's
pretty big.

10:24.248 --> 22:49.890
North? South?

10:25.500 --> 22:51.142
Southern Basque.

10:27.752 --> 22:53.394
Point eight ounces?

10:28.753 --> 22:54.395
Sorry, we only
have point sixes.

10:30.254 --> 22:55.896
Aw.

10:33.091 --> 22:58.733
PETER:
Yeah, hi. Do you have stuff?

10:34.884 --> 23:00.526
STOREKEEPER:
Yeah, we have stuff!

10:36.385 --> 23:02.027
And is it true that you've been
spending the farm's money

10:38.971 --> 23:04.613
on gingham shirts you tie into
a knot to expose your belly?

10:42.100 --> 23:07.742
I bought a couple.

10:43.768 --> 23:09.410
Well, with all this debt
and no income, there's no way

10:46.395 --> 23:12.037
we're gonna be able
to keep up our bank payments.

10:48.773 --> 23:14.415
Peter, if something
doesn't change,

10:50.483 --> 23:16.125
I'm afraid we're
gonna lose this farm.

10:53.027 --> 23:18.669
Great, just what I need
on my conscience:

10:54.779 --> 23:20.421
another failed business.

10:58.533 --> 23:24.175
Hi, I'd like to rent
The Proposal.

11:00.910 --> 23:26.552
Hang on, let me check
the return slot.

11:02.995 --> 23:28.637
I'm sorry, it hasn't
been returned yet.

11:04.789 --> 23:30.431
I have a poster from The
Proposal you can look at.

11:07.041 --> 23:32.683
You'll get
most of the story.

11:08.417 --> 23:34.059
Huh. They seem
pretty mismatched.

11:10.503 --> 23:36.145
There you go.

11:11.796 --> 23:37.438
Look, it's like
I've been saying,

11:13.005 --> 23:38.647
farming is
very difficult.

11:14.423 --> 23:40.065
When? W-When did
you say that?

11:16.134 --> 23:41.776
Farming takes incredible
skill and knowledge

11:18.177 --> 23:43.819
and the sort
of specialized experience

11:19.929 --> 23:45.571
that takes generations
to acquire.

11:21.681 --> 23:47.323
Dad, my favorite hen laid
this crazy-looking egg!

11:26.060 --> 23:51.702
Cheep-cheep.

11:27.770 --> 23:53.412
What's your point, Brian?

11:28.813 --> 23:54.455
My point is that
maybe I should go

11:33.442 --> 23:59.084
With the proper training,
maybe I can actually

11:35.528 --> 24:01.170
learn something that
will save this farm.

11:37.280 --> 24:02.922
Wow, Brian,
that's a great idea.

11:38.823 --> 24:04.465
And, hey, maybe I could give
the speech at your graduation.

11:41.284 --> 24:06.926
I'm really good at that.

11:42.827 --> 24:08.469
And so, as I look out at your
smiling faces filled with hope,

11:46.956 --> 24:12.598
all I can think is,
you are completely screwed.

11:49.834 --> 24:15.476
As Martin Luther King once said,
"Ouch, I've been shot.‘'

11:53.296 --> 24:18.938
Thank you.

11:56.966 --> 24:22.608
Okay, that's
all my stuff.

11:58.551 --> 24:24.193
I'm off to State Tech Ag
Central College Tech.

12:01.554 --> 24:27.196
There's really two
"techs" in there?

12:03.306 --> 24:28.948
(sighs) The proudest day
ofa man's life

12:05.558 --> 24:31.200
is when his dog
goes off to college.

12:07.852 --> 24:33.494
|'|| learn all I can.

12:09.228 --> 24:34.870
And I'll see you guys soon.

12:14.066 --> 24:39.708
Aw, he packed a guitar?
What a douche.

12:18.821 --> 24:44.463
Guys, what's that over there?

12:28.206 --> 24:53.848
Oh, my God, it's a tornado!

12:30.583 --> 24:56.225
And it's coming this way!
We got to run!

12:33.085 --> 24:58.727
Hang on, guys, it might just be
the Tasmanian Devil.

12:37.006 --> 25:02.648
Come on!
Into the storm cellar!

12:43.221 --> 25:08.863
MEG: What is this place?
It's really dark down here.

12:45.765 --> 25:11.407
PETER: Shh.
MEG: What?
Did you hear something?

12:47.391 --> 25:13.033
PETER: No, I just want you
to stop talking.

12:49.602 --> 25:15.244
CHRIS: Wait, I think
I found the lights.

12:53.397 --> 25:19.039
Wh-What is that?

12:55.399 --> 25:21.041
Aw, sweet!
It's some kind of lab.

12:56.901 --> 25:22.543
Hey, maybe it has
one of those things that goes...

12:59.153 --> 25:24.795
(imitates electricity humming)

13:01.781 --> 25:27.423
'Cause that's
important for science.

13:03.407 --> 25:29.049
Look at all this stuff.

13:05.034 --> 25:30.676
Burners, plastic tubing.

13:07.036 --> 25:32.678
12 cases of
cold medicine?

13:09.121 --> 25:34.763
You guys...

13:10.248 --> 25:35.890
Ithink this is
a meth lab.

13:12.541 --> 25:38.183
Oh, my God.

13:13.417 --> 25:39.059
You mean like
as in...

13:15.044 --> 25:40.686
D-R-U-G-S?

13:17.046 --> 25:42.688
Aren't those
l-L-L-E-G-A-L?

13:19.924 --> 25:45.566
What's going on?

13:20.925 --> 25:46.567
What are you guys
talking about?

13:22.134 --> 25:47.776
Uh-oh, someone's
getting cranky.

13:24.428 --> 25:50.070
I think he
needs an N-A-P.

13:26.389 --> 25:52.031
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?

13:28.057 --> 25:53.699
Man, I got to crack this code.

13:35.439 --> 26:01.081
Oh, my God!

13:36.941 --> 26:02.583
You guys, there's
a fully functional meth lab

13:38.651 --> 26:04.293
in our basement.

13:40.069 --> 26:05.711
Boy, we should
clean this place up.

13:41.570 --> 26:07.212
It's a meth.

13:43.155 --> 26:08.797
Brian?

13:44.323 --> 26:09.965
Oh, right, you're at college.

13:45.783 --> 26:11.425
We have to call
the police.

13:47.076 --> 26:12.718
Whoa, whoa,
hang on, Lois.

13:47.952 --> 26:13.594
Now, I know you're
freaked out,

13:49.328 --> 26:14.970
but when you really stop
and think about it,

13:51.205 --> 26:16.847
this meth lab is our
family's best chance

13:53.165 --> 26:18.807
to make meth in a lab.

13:54.834 --> 26:20.476
What... what are you
talking about, Peter?

13:56.794 --> 26:22.436
I'm talking about
saving the farm.

13:58.087 --> 26:23.729
Don't you see?

13:59.588 --> 26:25.230
This lab is just what we need
to get back on our feet.

14:01.966 --> 26:27.608
No way, Peter.

14:03.301 --> 26:28.943
Dealing drugs
is morally wrong,

14:04.719 --> 26:30.361
not to mention
incredibly dangerous.

14:07.096 --> 26:32.738
Come on, we've always
been risk takers.

14:08.597 --> 26:34.239
You remember
when we did it

14:09.974 --> 26:35.616
in the bathroom at
that restaurant?

14:11.600 --> 26:37.242
Ican't believe
we're actually gonna do this.

14:13.602 --> 26:39.244
Yeah. You go in first,
and I'll go in a minute.

14:21.986 --> 26:47.628
PETER (moaning):
Oh, wow!

14:23.612 --> 26:49.254
Oh, my God!

14:25.114 --> 26:50.756
Oh, this is amazing!

14:30.619 --> 26:56.261
You dirty girl.

14:32.997 --> 26:58.639
Peter, I haven't
left yet.

14:35.333 --> 27:00.975
You sick whore.

14:38.127 --> 27:03.769
Look, it'd just be
temporary, Lois.

14:39.503 --> 27:05.145
Just for a bit, just till we
get the farm back on its feet.

14:42.506 --> 27:08.148
Till we get our family
back on its feet.

14:44.633 --> 27:10.275
I don't know...
Lois, we've always

14:46.135 --> 27:11.777
given our family
whatever it needs.

14:48.012 --> 27:13.654
Well, right now,
our family needs us

14:50.222 --> 27:15.864
to sell illegal drugs to
the tank top community.

14:52.892 --> 27:18.534
What do you say?

14:56.979 --> 27:22.621
All right, Peter, we can make
one meth, and that's it.

15:00.149 --> 27:25.791
And it's only because I don't
see any other way out of this.

15:03.027 --> 27:28.669
Thanks, Lois.

15:04.028 --> 27:29.670
Oh, this is gonna
work out great.

15:05.905 --> 27:31.547
Hey, are you guys
gonna feed us anytime soon?

15:08.157 --> 27:33.799
No, sorry, we're
doing meth stuff now.

15:09.992 --> 27:35.634
I'll eat that.

15:11.369 --> 27:37.011
You just got clean.

15:17.166 --> 27:42.808
Everyone, now that
I'm a meth dealer,

15:19.043 --> 27:44.685
I'm going to respond
violently to outside noises

15:21.545 --> 27:47.187
that the rest of
you don't hear.

15:23.172 --> 27:48.814
Uh, okay, Peter,
but I...

15:24.382 --> 27:50.024
What was that?!

15:26.300 --> 27:51.942
Dad, I think that
was just a cricket.

15:28.386 --> 27:54.028
Then what the hell was that?!

15:29.387 --> 27:55.029
That was just
me saying,

15:30.888 --> 27:56.530
"That was just
a cricket."

15:32.056 --> 27:57.698
Dad, settle down.

15:33.057 --> 27:58.699
There's no one
out there, Peter.

15:35.184 --> 28:00.826
You sure?

15:36.394 --> 28:02.036
Yeah, yeah, you're right,
it's probably just a--

15:38.062 --> 28:03.704
Did you guys lock the truck?!

15:39.438 --> 28:05.080
Dad, we don't
even have a...

15:40.689 --> 28:06.331
What the hell is
going on out there?!

15:42.775 --> 28:08.417
Come on out,
whoever you are!

15:44.026 --> 28:09.668
I want to show my kids

15:45.027 --> 28:10.669
what it looks like
when a bitch dies!

15:46.821 --> 28:12.463
Peter, there's
no one there.

15:48.030 --> 28:13.672
Well, maybe I
should just fire

15:49.198 --> 28:14.840
a couple of rounds
into the darkness.

15:53.327 --> 28:18.969
Don't hear those
crickets no more.

15:55.204 --> 28:20.846
I'm not...
gonna make it.

15:57.081 --> 28:22.723
You hang in there,
you hear me?

15:58.958 --> 28:24.600
Listen to me.

16:00.084 --> 28:25.726
I want you to take
care of my kids.

16:02.086 --> 28:27.728
lwill.

16:03.546 --> 28:29.188
And I want you to be there
whenever there's a bad joke.

16:07.716 --> 28:33.358
Let them know.
Let them know.

16:12.096 --> 28:37.738
Gee, I hope I didn't
scare the cows.

16:14.098 --> 28:39.740
I don't want to put
them in a bad mood.

16:16.225 --> 28:41.867
(cricket chirping)

16:18.102 --> 28:43.744
(chirping, sobbing)

16:23.441 --> 28:49.083
(bird coos)
What's that, Dad?

16:25.317 --> 28:50.959
It's my new meth
distribution system.

16:27.611 --> 28:53.253
I've trained this
carrier pigeon

16:28.988 --> 28:54.630
to do all my deliveries for me.

16:30.614 --> 28:56.256
Fly away, Benjamin!

16:33.742 --> 28:59.384
Ah, perfect, perfect.

16:35.119 --> 29:00.761
Now this is the money
I owe Peter.

16:37.329 --> 29:02.971
Iwant you
to take it back to him.

16:39.623 --> 29:05.265
Do you understand?

16:43.127 --> 29:08.769
P Round and round

16:44.962 --> 29:10.604
P With love, we'll ﬁnd...

16:49.175 --> 29:14.817
Yes, hello, I'd like to buy
400 blister packs of Actifed,

16:52.595 --> 29:18.237
or similar pseudoephedrine-based
decongestant.

16:54.930 --> 29:20.572
Why?

16:55.973 --> 29:21.615
I have a cold.

16:58.601 --> 29:24.243
Achoo.

16:59.977 --> 29:25.619
Hang on, let me
check something.

17:06.984 --> 29:32.626
Okay, you're fine.

17:08.194 --> 29:33.836
Be right back.

17:09.820 --> 29:35.462
Well done, Stewie.

17:10.988 --> 29:36.630
That could've gone really wrong.

17:12.490 --> 29:38.132
Like that Kid Rock concert.

17:15.826 --> 29:41.468
(gaspS)

17:16.994 --> 29:42.636
Oh, my God, help!

17:18.329 --> 29:43.971
He's having
a heart attack!

17:19.622 --> 29:45.264
Is anyone here
a doctor?!

17:21.123 --> 29:46.765
No (bleep) way
someone's a doctor here.

17:28.130 --> 29:53.772
Hey, everyone, I'm back!

17:30.633 --> 29:56.275
Hello?

17:32.009 --> 29:57.651
What the hell?

17:36.138 --> 30:01.780
(growling)

17:39.141 --> 30:04.783
(muffled):
Hey, Brian's home!

17:40.976 --> 30:06.618
What the hell
is going on?

17:42.853 --> 30:08.495
Nothing, nothing.

17:44.230 --> 30:09.872
Just working on
a family project.

17:45.523 --> 30:11.165
Getting in some
together time.

17:46.857 --> 30:12.499
I have a crossbow!

17:48.150 --> 30:13.792
Chris has a crossbow.

17:49.151 --> 30:14.793
Okay, well, uh...

17:51.654 --> 30:17.296
I'm back
from agricultural school,

17:53.364 --> 30:19.006
and I might have the solution
to our farming trouble.

17:55.991 --> 30:21.633
I brought some
heirloom tomato seeds.

17:58.035 --> 30:23.677
That's nice, Brian.

17:59.537 --> 30:25.179
Here's a new kind of meth
you put in your pee-hole.

18:01.664 --> 30:27.306
Wh-What?

18:02.748 --> 30:28.390
Oh, yeah,
we're meth dealers now.

18:03.874 --> 30:29.516
Yeah, you missed it.

18:04.875 --> 30:30.517
My teeth came in
and then fell out again.

18:06.877 --> 30:32.519
I don't believe this!
Are you guys insane?!

18:08.671 --> 30:34.313
We're rich
is what we are!

18:09.880 --> 30:35.522
Look at all
that cash, Brian.

18:11.048 --> 30:36.690
(stammering):
He don't get none of that!

18:12.383 --> 30:38.025
He wasn't
here for it!

18:13.884 --> 30:39.526
Well, this is just great!

18:15.010 --> 30:40.652
I turn my back for a month,

18:16.178 --> 30:41.820
and this place
turns into a drug den!

18:18.013 --> 30:43.655
For your information,
it is also a drag queen hangout.

18:21.308 --> 30:46.950
Hey, look, our meth
is on the news!

18:24.061 --> 30:49.703
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

18:25.312 --> 30:50.954
Our top story: Methamphetamine
is flooding into Quahog

18:28.190 --> 30:53.832
in epidemic amounts, and is
believed to be originating

18:31.068 --> 30:56.710
from the nearby
rural community of Farmton.

18:33.279 --> 30:58.921
Farmton-- that's the name
of the place we live.

18:35.197 --> 31:00.839
For more on the story,
we now go live

18:38.075 --> 31:03.717
to Asian correspondent
Tricia Takanawa.

18:40.202 --> 31:05.844
Tom, meth is fine!
Everything's fine!

18:41.704 --> 31:07.346
Go back to your own business!

18:43.080 --> 31:08.722
Thanks, Tricia.

18:44.081 --> 31:09.723
She's doing fun things
for me, for money.

18:46.333 --> 31:11.975
Oh, my God.

18:47.793 --> 31:13.435
We're hurting
our own hometown.

18:49.712 --> 31:15.354
All those drugs that are

18:51.213 --> 31:16.855
flooding into Quahog
are from us.

18:53.090 --> 31:18.732
Oh, yeah?

18:54.425 --> 31:20.067
Well, if we're dealing
so many drugs to Quahog,

18:56.594 --> 31:22.236
why is the Quahog envelope
so light this week?

18:58.804 --> 31:24.446
Yeah, I say
we go down there

19:00.472 --> 31:26.114
and talk to
those people in Quahog.

19:02.600 --> 31:28.242
No! This is
what I'm talking about.

19:04.935 --> 31:30.577
Meth has turned
us into monsters.

19:07.104 --> 31:32.746
Lois, take it easy.
No. You know what?

19:09.106 --> 31:34.748
This is my own fault
for listening to you.

19:11.108 --> 31:36.750
| forgot you don't even
know your ass

19:13.110 --> 31:38.752
from a hole
in the ground.

19:15.738 --> 31:41.380
Is that... is that my ass?

19:18.991 --> 31:44.633
Lois, where
the hell you going?

19:20.826 --> 31:46.468
I'm going back home to
Quahog, where I belong.

19:23.454 --> 31:49.096
If any of you want to come
with me, you're welcome to.

19:26.248 --> 31:51.890
First of all,
you sat in something green

19:27.958 --> 31:53.600
and it's on your butt,
so no one's gonna follow you.

19:30.127 --> 31:55.769
And second,
no one's gonna leave a place

19:32.004 --> 31:57.646
where there are
tons of beakers

19:33.088 --> 31:58.730
for a place where
there are zero beakers.

19:35.257 --> 32:00.899
Peter, don't you see?

19:36.634 --> 32:02.276
We left Quahog because
of the crime problem.

19:39.136 --> 32:04.778
But now we've become
part of that problem.

19:41.972 --> 32:07.614
Yo, what is this bitch
trippin' about?!

19:43.891 --> 32:09.533
Look at our
lives, Peter.

19:45.267 --> 32:10.909
Look at our family.

19:46.477 --> 32:12.119
I don't recognize
us anymore.

19:48.646 --> 32:14.288
It's time to go back
to Spooner Street

19:50.606 --> 32:16.248
and be the
Griffins again.

19:54.610 --> 32:20.252
Let's go, Peter.

19:56.153 --> 32:21.795
Let's go back
to Quahog.

19:58.155 --> 32:23.797
But... but what about
this farm?

20:00.032 --> 32:25.674
And this house?

20:01.367 --> 32:27.009
And the lab inside the house,
which is currently producing

20:04.036 --> 32:29.678
an incredibly volatile
and explosive batch

20:06.038 --> 32:31.680
of thermo-reactive chemic...

20:14.672 --> 32:40.314
There were a lot of
Rottweilers in that house.

20:21.178 --> 32:46.820
Well, it's good to be
back in our old house.

20:23.681 --> 32:49.323
How did we get this place
back, by the way?

20:25.808 --> 32:51.450
Well, luckily the value
of this place plummeted

20:27.810 --> 32:53.452
because this is
a meth town now.

20:29.186 --> 32:54.828
You know, I think the
lesson here is that

20:31.313 --> 32:56.955
if your community has problems,
you don't abandon it.

20:34.817 --> 33:00.459
It's better to stay put and
help fix those problems.

20:37.528 --> 33:03.170
That's right, Lois, 'cause
wherever you run to,

20:39.321 --> 33:04.963
your problems have a
funny way of finding you.

20:41.448 --> 33:07.090
(knocking)

20:42.533 --> 33:08.175
WOMAN:
Hey, are you guys in there?

20:44.201 --> 33:09.843
Peter, I need a taste!

20:47.162 --> 33:12.804
Oh, my God, it's Jodie Sweetin.

20:48.455 --> 33:14.097
Quick, everyone
lie on the floor.

20:51.166 --> 33:16.808
JODIE: Peter, come on! I've got
Maureen McCormick with me.

20:53.836 --> 33:19.478
She'll let you
finish anywhere.

20:55.337 --> 33:20.979
Okay, everyone hide upstairs.
Daddy's gonna take care of this.
