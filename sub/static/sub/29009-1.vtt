I gotta find your sister right away.

05:07.311 --> 05:12.311
Did you check her room?

05:13.110 --> 05:15.345
- Which one's her room?

05:15.345 --> 05:17.763
- She shares a room with Carolina.

05:17.763 --> 05:18.698
Room 119.

05:18.698 --> 05:22.698
- I got a nice quiet room
with two beds for $18.

05:23.844 --> 05:26.348
- You got anything cheaper?

05:26.348 --> 05:31.091
- I got singles for 12,
but it's only got one bed.

05:31.091 --> 05:32.174
- That'll do.

05:38.144 --> 05:41.644
- You all gonna sleep piled up in one bed?

05:42.585 --> 05:46.252
- Kids like to bunk on
the floor, don't you?

05:50.198 --> 05:53.029
- Ma'am, wouldn't your
kids be more comfortable

05:53.029 --> 05:54.962
in their own bed?

05:54.962 --> 05:59.954
- These kids aren't mine.

05:59.954 --> 06:02.121
They're my brothers.

06:02.121 --> 06:04.538
We're meeting him in Atlanta.

06:10.578 --> 06:14.995
He's been roughnecking out
on an oil rig in the Gulf.

06:18.278 --> 06:21.945
I can't wait to get
these kids off my hands.

06:26.976 --> 06:27.893
- Room 333.

09:09.665 --> 09:14.665
- Until the grass is mowed!

10:54.975 --> 10:55.892
- Bed bugs.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.046
- Go inside.

11:26.046 --> 11:27.778
- I'm afraid.

11:27.778 --> 11:28.861
- I'm afraid.

11:30.620 --> 11:35.620
Mario, Abby, just
get your whiny butts inside.

13:10.305 --> 13:12.222
It's my heart medicine.

13:13.586 --> 13:17.086
A bit of wine a day keeps the doctor away.

13:34.952 --> 13:36.202
It's fortified.

13:37.109 --> 13:38.442
- For and fived?

13:39.820 --> 13:41.760
- Shut up, Abby.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.260
You are so stupid.

13:58.423 --> 14:03.256
I am sick and tired of ridin'
around with you little kids.

14:05.568 --> 14:10.318
Tonight I am gonna ride around
with a couple of grownups.

14:18.037 --> 14:19.965
Those boys and girls across the street

14:19.965 --> 14:23.048
look like they've got the right idea.

15:06.595 --> 15:09.073
Might as well get a little buzz going on,

15:09.073 --> 15:11.240
save some cash at the bar.

15:15.854 --> 15:16.687
Woo!

15:30.859 --> 15:34.276
I'll be entertaining on that bed tonight.

15:36.753 --> 15:38.836
Runts, stay outta my way.

15:48.349 --> 15:52.016
Stinkin' kids, you give
me a total migraine.

15:57.911 --> 15:59.411
- No, sir.

16:00.745 --> 16:02.412
- Looks like a fish.

16:07.187 --> 16:08.716
There's no men in here.

16:08.716 --> 16:10.383
This is a dry hole.

16:10.383 --> 16:14.508
- Men in here?

16:14.508 --> 16:16.508
- Lights are killin' me!

16:17.684 --> 16:20.354
- The paper's not yours, sister.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.814
- Mario.
- The phone.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.229
- Turn off that light.

16:29.274 --> 16:31.997
- I'm ready to
be tied up, Betty Lou.

16:31.997 --> 16:33.937
- Four Eyes.

16:33.937 --> 16:38.208
You know you're supposed
to tie me up first.

16:40.414 --> 16:41.331
- Oh.

16:42.745 --> 16:46.921
♪ Well ya don't have to run, you don't ♪

16:51.908 --> 16:53.322
- Reba, Gizmo?

16:53.322 --> 16:56.413
- Yeah, Ferd, can we come in?

16:56.413 --> 16:58.490
- I don't know.

16:58.490 --> 16:59.775
What you want?

16:59.775 --> 17:01.192
- You know, bugs.

17:04.530 --> 17:08.108
- I don't know, man, I guess I got some.

17:08.108 --> 17:10.296
- Well, like, can we try a little?

17:10.296 --> 17:11.851
- You've had your free sample.

17:11.851 --> 17:14.050
You know what it does.

17:14.050 --> 17:17.539
- Yeah, but Kado hasn't and
he wants to try a little.

17:17.539 --> 17:20.516
- Somethin' for nothin'
because he's a newb?

17:20.516 --> 17:22.147
This ain't no charity.

17:22.147 --> 17:24.815
You want bugs, you pay for bugs.

17:45.501 --> 17:47.918
- Whoa, that's how it's done?

17:53.010 --> 17:53.927
- How many?

17:58.788 --> 17:59.621
- Three.

18:03.104 --> 18:03.937
- Two.

18:06.166 --> 18:09.916
- Gizmo, you printed
the front on both sides.

18:14.558 --> 18:15.725
- Sorry, Ferd.

18:17.932 --> 18:19.182
- One, I guess.

18:24.976 --> 18:28.393
Like, how do we know it's the real thing?

18:29.458 --> 18:34.136
- You smoke it, you get off,
it's the real thing!

18:34.136 --> 18:37.535
- You put it in a real cigarette.

18:37.535 --> 18:39.412
- Nobody said anything about cigarettes.

18:39.412 --> 18:41.226
I don't smoke.

18:41.226 --> 18:45.012
- Well you don't smoke, you don't get off.

18:45.012 --> 18:47.262
- No, I guess I'll take it.

18:58.619 --> 19:02.430
- It's just ground up bug
powder, it's not illegal.

19:02.430 --> 19:04.347
- How's it work anyway?

19:05.363 --> 19:08.216
- Bed bugs secrete a
venom so they can bite you

19:08.216 --> 19:12.216
while you're asleep, and
that venom is narcotic.

19:13.851 --> 19:15.964
Keeps ya from wakin' up.

19:15.964 --> 19:19.464
When ya smoke it, the venom gets you high.

19:22.238 --> 19:23.071
- Way high.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.918
- Hey, hey, hey, there's
no smokin' in here.

19:31.918 --> 19:34.487
This is a no smokin' room.

19:34.487 --> 19:35.570
- No smoking?

19:37.059 --> 19:38.646
In here?

19:42.285 --> 19:45.022
- Outside, all of y'all.

19:45.022 --> 19:45.855
Get!

19:47.562 --> 19:48.395
Idiots!

20:11.663 --> 20:12.590
- Yeah?

20:12.590 --> 20:14.449
- There are bed bugs in my room.

20:14.449 --> 20:15.538
- Not my problem.

20:15.538 --> 20:17.295
- It is your problem.

20:17.295 --> 20:18.773
- Unh-unh.

20:18.773 --> 20:22.617
- Carnivorous cooties are
cutting me up while I sleep.

20:22.617 --> 20:25.546
They're making my sweat bloody.

20:25.546 --> 20:27.884
My sweat is valuable.

20:27.884 --> 20:30.954
People pay me for my sweat.

20:30.954 --> 20:33.747
Women use it as an aphrodisiac.

20:33.747 --> 20:36.126
- I could spot ya some bandages.

20:36.126 --> 20:41.126
- I can't go to competition
with bandages all over me.

20:41.223 --> 20:43.464
Those little vampires are gobbling up

20:43.464 --> 20:45.381
all my growth hormones.

20:46.264 --> 20:49.671
I've spent a fortune on my roids.

20:49.671 --> 20:54.504
- Well, sounds to me like
chicken would have been cheaper.

21:08.014 --> 21:09.014
That's rude.

21:17.525 --> 21:18.358
Ew.

22:21.792 --> 22:24.502
- These bugs
are gettin' way bigger.

22:24.502 --> 22:26.846
- I noticed that, too.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.929
Bugs must be on steroids.

22:31.327 --> 22:32.994
- Oh, legs are numb.

22:33.883 --> 22:35.216
- Bed bug venom.

22:36.885 --> 22:38.608
- You workin' on them bugs?

22:38.608 --> 22:40.041
- Duh.

22:40.041 --> 22:43.554
Like, I'm the only one
around here doin' anything.

22:43.554 --> 22:45.887
- I just been so tired lately.

22:48.439 --> 22:51.819
Maybe we should skip to every other night.

22:51.819 --> 22:53.586
- No can do.

22:53.586 --> 22:55.251
Bugs require a fresh supply of blood

22:55.251 --> 22:57.560
during their gestation cycle.

22:57.560 --> 23:00.816
- Too bad that chicken idea didn't work.

23:00.816 --> 23:02.126
- Now who'd have thought some little bugs

23:02.126 --> 23:04.754
could kill a full-grown
chicken in one day!

23:04.754 --> 23:06.167
- Drained it dry.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.062
- And I can't pluck a chicken every day.

23:08.062 --> 23:10.868
That one pecked the jibbers outta me.

23:10.868 --> 23:12.919
- Well I guess we'll have
to sacrifice a little

23:12.919 --> 23:15.336
to get this business rollin'.

23:16.276 --> 23:19.459
- Now I read where some people used a cat.

23:19.459 --> 23:21.188
- There's been no cats around here

23:21.188 --> 23:23.881
since that Korean restaurant opened up.

23:23.881 --> 23:24.714
- Lorelie!

23:26.555 --> 23:30.675
We need to shave a cat.

23:30.675 --> 23:33.956
- Well getting pecked
by a chicken is nothing.

23:33.956 --> 23:37.738
You just try shavin' some
old stray cat.

24:01.899 --> 24:03.899
- There's monsters here.

24:09.393 --> 24:12.536
- I know, they're in the walls.

24:12.536 --> 24:13.619
- I'm afraid.

24:16.302 --> 24:17.664
- I'll build a fort.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.914
They won't bother us there.

24:51.767 --> 24:54.341
- Them people you read
about in that magazine,

24:54.341 --> 24:56.982
how'd they shave their cat?

24:56.982 --> 24:58.065
- Didn't say.

24:58.924 --> 25:02.140
Just said that they shaved the cat.

25:05.716 --> 25:10.716
And made it a nice bed where it
would sleep and feed the bugs.

25:11.237 --> 25:15.320
Won't even look like a
cat, all shaved like that.

25:28.270 --> 25:33.270
- I need to go to the bathroom.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.099
- I'll check it out.

25:54.128 --> 25:56.045
It's okay, no monsters.

26:15.444 --> 26:19.194
- Mario, turn
off that dagburn light.

26:42.362 --> 26:45.203
- Don't worry, I'll protect you.

26:45.203 --> 26:46.370
- Okay.

26:49.762 --> 26:53.345
- These bugs are way
bigger than yesterday.

26:55.844 --> 26:56.762
- They are?

26:56.762 --> 26:58.012
They are, well.

26:59.190 --> 27:00.940
Better profit margin.

27:02.025 --> 27:04.358
- You sure they're bed bugs?

27:05.599 --> 27:08.174
- They're the real deal.

27:08.174 --> 27:10.674
Just means I'm doin' it right.

27:12.156 --> 27:13.406
- Sure are big.

28:01.784 --> 28:04.867
Think I'll go stretch out on the bed.

28:05.898 --> 28:07.398
Just for a little.

28:20.591 --> 28:21.424
- Me, too.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.535
Sleepin' on that couch has me wasted.

28:45.061 --> 28:46.228
I felt that one.

28:47.881 --> 28:51.548
No, no, no, no, no!

29:10.008 --> 29:13.091
Lorelie?

29:17.474 --> 29:18.307
Oh, oh.

29:24.902 --> 29:27.485
No.

29:50.878 --> 29:51.961
- I'm hungry.

30:05.767 --> 30:06.934
It's all gone!

30:09.410 --> 30:12.964
- I need to make a run for the door.

30:12.964 --> 30:14.547
- Please, don't go.

30:16.545 --> 30:18.045
- I'm really fast.

30:20.441 --> 30:22.343
Just shine them with this.

30:22.343 --> 30:24.676
They're scared of the light.

30:45.576 --> 30:47.088
Aunt Miemi?

30:47.088 --> 30:50.338
Whoa!

31:19.552 --> 31:21.385
Abby, it's time to go.

32:56.909 --> 32:58.893
- I really can't believe you,

32:58.893 --> 33:02.295
meeting some strange guy at
a fleabag motel like this?

33:02.295 --> 33:04.237
If this guy was any kind of a car dealer,

33:04.237 --> 33:06.039
he'd meet you at his dealership.

33:06.039 --> 33:08.191
- Just drop it, Collette.

33:08.191 --> 33:10.637
This guy's got something I want.

33:20.318 --> 33:21.151
- Ladies.

33:22.972 --> 33:23.805
Miss Grey?

33:25.902 --> 33:28.192
- I'm Doreen Grey.

33:28.192 --> 33:29.775
- Nice to meet you.

33:31.802 --> 33:32.635
Al Sharko.

33:33.619 --> 33:35.036
- I can see that.

33:36.844 --> 33:38.147
- Okay.

33:38.147 --> 33:42.064
Well let's see what you
pretty ladies got here.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.472
- Ew.

34:35.476 --> 34:39.726
This looks like the honeymoon
suite for orangutans.

34:43.746 --> 34:45.599
- That's it?

34:45.599 --> 34:48.306
That's Marilyn Monroe's charm?

34:48.306 --> 34:49.723
- Yep, that's it.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.906
- It's just a rotten old piece of wood.

34:52.906 --> 34:55.231
- Trust me, that's really it.

34:55.231 --> 34:57.139
- What's that supposed to be?

34:57.139 --> 35:01.309
- Well, it's real name is
Marie Antoinette's Guillotine.

35:01.309 --> 35:03.396
- Marionette's Guillotine?

35:03.396 --> 35:05.380
You said you had that charm thingy

35:05.380 --> 35:08.301
that Marilyn Monroe used
to get into Playboy.

35:08.301 --> 35:10.340
- She did use it for that.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.617
- Would somebody please
tell me what's going on?

35:12.617 --> 35:14.897
- Your friend is trading a used car

35:14.897 --> 35:18.122
for something far more
valuable, something that can

35:18.122 --> 35:21.116
take her much further
than that car ever could.

35:24.792 --> 35:29.125
This unique relic is all
that's left of a guillotine

35:31.505 --> 35:34.887
that was used to execute
a beautiful French queen

35:34.887 --> 35:38.693
in the city of Paris a long time ago.

35:38.693 --> 35:42.019
The dark stain on the wood is from where

35:42.019 --> 35:46.297
Marie Antoinette's blood
gushed when the blade

35:46.297 --> 35:50.567
came down and lopped off
her pretty little head.

35:50.567 --> 35:54.533
Since that time a number of
exquisitely beautiful women

35:54.533 --> 35:57.865
have worn this charm to give themselves

35:57.865 --> 36:00.282
an edge over all other women.

36:02.510 --> 36:05.217
- This is what you're
trading your car for?

36:05.217 --> 36:06.542
Some old stick of wood

36:06.542 --> 36:08.438
that's supposed to make you beautiful?

36:08.438 --> 36:10.285
- It really does work.

36:10.285 --> 36:13.483
I know for a fact that
Marilyn Monroe's charm

36:13.483 --> 36:17.255
was used by three Miss Global winners.

36:17.255 --> 36:19.729
- Marie Antoinette's Guillotine

36:19.729 --> 36:22.405
is definitely what you
need if you really do

36:22.405 --> 36:25.159
want to win a beauty pageant, sure.

36:25.159 --> 36:26.742
- I really do want,

36:28.481 --> 36:32.362
but how do we know it's the real thing?

36:32.362 --> 36:35.363
Like, where did you get it?

36:35.363 --> 36:38.125
- A reliable acquaintance
of mine, Mr. Stumpy Nixon,

36:38.125 --> 36:40.383
acquired it from the
Hughes estate collection

36:40.383 --> 36:43.165
shortly before it was up for auction.

36:43.165 --> 36:45.058
- Well we have to test it to make sure

36:45.058 --> 36:46.725
it's the real thing.

36:47.671 --> 36:50.131
- Sure, let's take it for a test drive.

36:50.131 --> 36:51.798
- Not on me, on her.

36:54.091 --> 36:55.973
Put it on Collette.

36:55.973 --> 36:58.539
Putting it on me wouldn't prove anything.

36:58.539 --> 37:01.374
- Sure, whatever you want.

37:01.374 --> 37:03.207
Right on the cut line.

37:07.184 --> 37:11.798
That's where it works the best.

37:14.532 --> 37:16.097
Whoa.

37:16.097 --> 37:20.764
Looks to me like that is
exactly what you want.

37:20.764 --> 37:22.264
No doubt about it.

37:25.610 --> 37:26.777
- Take it off.

37:28.097 --> 37:28.930
It's mine.

37:32.620 --> 37:34.782
Give it to me right now.

37:34.782 --> 37:36.979
- What's the hurry?

37:36.979 --> 37:38.219
- Take it off this instant.

37:38.219 --> 37:39.052
- Hey.

37:40.052 --> 37:42.339
Hey, cut it out, I'll get it!

37:42.339 --> 37:43.339
I'll get it.

37:46.865 --> 37:47.698
Here.

37:48.585 --> 37:50.085
You've got it now.

37:52.672 --> 37:55.419
- This may seem like a deal
as far as you're concerned,

37:55.419 --> 37:57.539
but I'm not so sure.

37:57.539 --> 38:01.286
Looks to me like I'm gettin'
the short end of the stick.

38:01.286 --> 38:03.650
- What do you mean the
short end of the stick?

38:03.650 --> 38:06.094
You called me wanting
to trade it for the car.

38:06.094 --> 38:09.511
I won fair and square in the SEC Pageant.

38:10.811 --> 38:15.000
- Problem here is that you
misrepresented that car.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.623
You said it was in mint condition.

38:16.623 --> 38:19.083
- I beg your pardon, Mr. Sharko.

38:19.083 --> 38:22.476
That car is in great
condition and you know it.

38:22.476 --> 38:25.836
- Yeah, that car is in great condition.

38:25.836 --> 38:30.369
- Well, let's just say

38:30.369 --> 38:33.578
you're gonna need somethin'
more than that old car

38:33.578 --> 38:36.245
to trade for this valuable item.

38:38.046 --> 38:40.379
- How much more do you want?

38:41.372 --> 38:44.421
- How 'bout somethin' a little special?

38:44.421 --> 38:46.869
- Oh, definitely not.

38:46.869 --> 38:50.119
Why do men always have to act like men?

38:51.873 --> 38:56.314
- You just happened to be the
first pageant girl I called.

38:56.314 --> 38:58.115
There's no doubt in my mind that there's

38:58.115 --> 39:00.047
someone else out there that would want

39:00.047 --> 39:03.757
this valuable merchandise more than you.

39:03.757 --> 39:04.840
- Well, wait.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.193
Wait!

39:08.276 --> 39:10.805
Please, let me try it on.

39:10.805 --> 39:12.972
Just let me test drive it.

39:19.330 --> 39:21.330
- Right on the cut line.

39:37.932 --> 39:42.932
- So, big guy, you were wanting
a little something extra

39:43.239 --> 39:45.656
for this little beaver treat.

39:47.012 --> 39:49.179
- Yeah, that'd be so nice.

39:50.111 --> 39:53.194
- Mm, how would you like a nice kiss?

39:54.826 --> 39:55.772
- Love it.

39:55.772 --> 39:57.522
- No, absolutely not.

39:58.491 --> 39:59.896
- What's the big deal?

39:59.896 --> 40:02.968
- Well, if you're going to do it,

40:02.968 --> 40:05.841
you've got to kiss him
from across the table.

40:05.841 --> 40:07.258
Like, no hugging.

40:08.422 --> 40:10.203
- I see what you mean.

40:10.203 --> 40:11.646
How 'bout it big guy?

40:11.646 --> 40:15.520
You wanna a little kiss
from across the table?

40:37.327 --> 40:39.160
You okay now, big guy?

40:41.509 --> 40:43.480
Here are the keys to the car.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.864
See ya later, alligator.

40:45.864 --> 40:48.031
- See ya later, alligator.

40:53.202 --> 40:54.909
- I think you coulda told
that guy to take the bus

40:54.909 --> 40:57.108
to Oregon and he would've done it.

40:57.108 --> 40:58.615
- I think you're right.

40:58.615 --> 41:00.720
But, he could snap out
of it around Birmingham

41:00.720 --> 41:03.137
and come back looking for us.

41:08.850 --> 41:12.202
I'm going to report the car stolen anyway.

41:12.202 --> 41:15.511
I can collect the insurance and buy me

41:15.511 --> 41:17.428
a brand new luxury car.

41:22.676 --> 41:27.060
This old scrap of timber
really doesn't look like much.

41:27.060 --> 41:29.977
- I think it's how you position it.

41:33.183 --> 41:37.135
Here, let me try it on again and show you.

41:37.135 --> 41:38.828
- Excuse me?

41:38.828 --> 41:42.264
I traded my car for this miracle charm.

41:42.264 --> 41:43.681
It stays with me.

41:44.669 --> 41:48.295
- Well, you're gonna have to
come up with a different gown.

41:48.295 --> 41:49.570
It's gonna look terribly out of place

41:49.570 --> 41:53.595
with that little shoulderless
thing you picked out.

41:53.595 --> 41:54.905
I wonder if you always have to wear it

41:54.905 --> 41:57.449
on the cut line for it to work.

41:57.449 --> 42:01.559
- Yeah, I wonder if
everyone who's ever used it

42:01.559 --> 42:05.317
always wore this old
thing around their neck.

42:05.317 --> 42:07.667
- Maybe you can hold it in your hand.

42:07.667 --> 42:09.069
- I'm not going to be able to walk around

42:09.069 --> 42:12.963
with it in my hand through
the whole competition.

42:12.963 --> 42:15.531
- You know, it seems a
shame to only use something

42:15.531 --> 42:18.103
that powerful just to win a pageant.

42:18.103 --> 42:22.272
With your looks you could
probably win the contest anyways.

42:22.272 --> 42:25.516
I'm the one who could use a little help.

42:25.516 --> 42:28.207
Maybe when you're not using
it to win beauty pageants

42:28.207 --> 42:31.299
you could loan it to me once in a while.

42:31.299 --> 42:33.302
- I don't think so.

42:33.302 --> 42:37.469
It's mine and it's only
meant for me and my needs.

42:41.050 --> 42:43.450
- Well you'd still be the owner and all.

42:43.450 --> 42:44.450
- Forget it.

42:45.370 --> 42:48.620
You won't be using it at all, not ever.

42:50.394 --> 42:53.956
- You are such a
self-centered prima donna.

42:53.956 --> 42:57.124
You know that's why everyone hates you.

42:57.124 --> 43:00.291
- I'm beautiful and everyone loves me.

43:02.741 --> 43:04.158
You even love me.

43:05.098 --> 43:06.848
You said so yourself.

43:08.317 --> 43:10.904
- Let me tell you, I've
done nothing but work

43:10.904 --> 43:13.893
and sacrifice to help you.

43:13.893 --> 43:17.300
How can you be so totally ungrateful?

43:17.300 --> 43:20.300
You wouldn't be anything without me.

43:22.507 --> 43:26.517
- I didn't need your help
then, and I don't need it now.

43:26.517 --> 43:29.339
I can do quite well without your help.

43:29.339 --> 43:32.337
- You have always needed my help, Doreen.

43:32.337 --> 43:33.335
- What have you ever done for me

43:33.335 --> 43:36.318
that I couldn't have done on my own?

43:36.318 --> 43:38.115
- I wax all that monkey hair off your back

43:38.115 --> 43:40.431
and thighs every week.

43:40.431 --> 43:41.626
If it weren't for me you'd be nothing

43:41.626 --> 43:45.807
but a curly-haired
chimpanzee in a swimsuit.

43:45.807 --> 43:47.661
- You cheap slut.

43:47.661 --> 43:51.428
You swore you'd keep my little
hair problem buried forever.

43:51.428 --> 43:52.875
- Looks like you're gonna need my help

43:52.875 --> 43:57.130
to keep this little secret
buried, too, Miss Monkey Girl.

43:57.130 --> 43:59.498
That little termite trap is stolen,

43:59.498 --> 44:04.081
and I'm sure the real owners
would love to get it back.

44:05.047 --> 44:07.168
- If you tell anyone, you'll be

44:07.168 --> 44:10.286
in just as much trouble as me.

44:10.286 --> 44:11.869
- I don't think so.

44:12.799 --> 44:14.645
I'm not gonna be reporting my car stolen

44:14.645 --> 44:16.810
to collect the insurance money.

44:16.810 --> 44:18.977
- I haven't done that yet.

44:24.532 --> 44:27.696
I guess I could let you use the necklace

44:27.696 --> 44:32.696
every once in a while when I
don't need it for something.

44:32.754 --> 44:35.661
Would ya like to try it on again?

44:35.661 --> 44:36.911
Like right now?

44:37.787 --> 44:38.787
- Right now?

44:39.751 --> 44:40.584
Sure.

44:41.709 --> 44:43.876
- Here, let me hook it on.

- I see.

50:42.576 --> 50:43.826
You poor thing.

50:45.219 --> 50:46.886
You've cut yourself.

50:53.355 --> 50:55.855
Oh yeah, I guess I'm bleeding.

51:17.747 --> 51:18.747
- It's okay.

51:22.170 --> 51:24.837

51:34.702 --> 51:36.202

But everybody just calls me Davie.

52:09.583 --> 52:10.416
Excuse me.

52:11.923 --> 52:14.173
- Well then excuse me, too.

52:18.463 --> 52:20.463
- So, is your foot okay?

52:24.233 --> 52:25.233
- It's fine.

52:27.276 --> 52:29.468
- What's wrong with this foot anyways?

52:29.468 --> 52:30.885
- Nothing really.

52:33.462 --> 52:35.710
- Why the crutches?

52:35.710 --> 52:39.793
- It was just an act to
get you to open the door.

52:41.815 --> 52:45.315
- Your little act didn't work out so well.

52:46.305 --> 52:49.369
You coulda hurt yourself
pulling a stunt like that.

52:49.369 --> 52:51.619
- I really did hurt myself.

52:53.322 --> 52:55.926
- I hope it was worth it.

52:55.926 --> 52:57.843
- Got me in to see you.

52:59.243 --> 53:03.411
- Well yeah, and now you got a nasty cut,

53:03.411 --> 53:05.994
you might even get a black eye.

53:09.098 --> 53:11.765
You did all this just to see me.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.363
- Yeah, and to get a tip.

53:16.800 --> 53:17.633
- A tip?

53:18.717 --> 53:20.326
A tip, is that really all you care about?

53:20.326 --> 53:22.246
- Well I had to try something.

53:22.246 --> 53:26.246
My boss said you don't
open the door for anyone.

53:27.548 --> 53:28.715
- That's true.

53:31.368 --> 53:33.975
I've stayed in here ever
since I retired from the Navy.

53:58.259 --> 54:00.592
- What'd you do in the Navy?

54:04.675 --> 54:06.499
- Submarine navigator.

54:06.499 --> 54:09.062
- I love submarines, they're so cool.

54:17.538 --> 54:18.788
- My boat sank.

54:21.147 --> 54:22.980
- Your submarine sank?

54:25.052 --> 54:26.469
And you survived?

54:27.356 --> 54:29.439
- Half the crew survived.

54:31.039 --> 54:34.766
Submarines have at least
two complete crews.

54:34.766 --> 54:37.158
While one crew is at sea on patrol,

54:37.158 --> 54:39.408
the second crew is topside.

54:42.678 --> 54:45.845
I was in this room when the boat sank.

54:47.307 --> 54:50.468
I didn't find out until I
showed up for duty at the base.

55:00.181 --> 55:04.527
- It musta hit you pretty
hard, losing all your friends.

55:11.362 --> 55:12.195
- Yeah.

55:15.771 --> 55:17.688
After that I came here.

55:21.331 --> 55:22.164
I retired.

55:23.698 --> 55:26.492
Didn't wanna be put with another crew.

55:26.492 --> 55:28.409
- When did this happen?

55:30.779 --> 55:32.612
- I'm not really sure.

55:34.646 --> 55:36.646
It seems like yesterday.

55:41.177 --> 55:44.344
I guess I don't keep up with the days.

55:45.346 --> 55:48.316
Now I just stay on my regular shift.

55:48.316 --> 55:50.066
- Your regular shift?

55:54.220 --> 55:57.303
- On the boat, we use an 18-hour day.

55:59.674 --> 56:04.674
Each shift is six hours,
six hours on, six hours off,

56:04.857 --> 56:06.690
six hours in the rack.

56:07.566 --> 56:10.862
- Well what about the
other six hours in the day?

56:10.862 --> 56:14.999
- The Navy discovered
that we don't need them.

56:14.999 --> 56:19.499
Submariners work better
without all those extra hours.

56:20.335 --> 56:22.339
- It sounds weird.

56:22.339 --> 56:25.215
- It's actually not as weird as it sounds.

56:25.215 --> 56:28.268
In fact, it actually works pretty good.

56:28.268 --> 56:31.280
Between patrols I always
come back to this room

56:31.280 --> 56:33.697
and continue on 18-hour days.

56:35.612 --> 56:39.612
- So does that nutty clock
always run that fast?

56:41.571 --> 56:42.404
- No.

56:44.598 --> 56:47.926
I thought the thing was
broken and stopped running.

56:47.926 --> 56:50.426
- Well, it's really goin' now.

56:53.672 --> 56:54.922
- Yeah.

56:56.925 --> 56:58.417
- It just seems so claustrophobic

56:58.417 --> 57:00.155
being cooped up here all the time.

57:02.099 --> 57:04.531
- Well I like bein' cooped up.

57:04.531 --> 57:07.715
Time stops when I'm all cooped up.

57:07.715 --> 57:09.699
We pull into port.

57:09.699 --> 57:13.699
The hatch opens up and
it's always the big jolt.

57:17.475 --> 57:18.475
- What jolt?

57:23.633 --> 57:26.800
- I hated getting back and finding out

57:27.903 --> 57:29.600
about all the things that
happened in the world

57:29.600 --> 57:31.183
while we were down.

57:32.155 --> 57:34.097
Married men getting off the boat

57:34.097 --> 57:36.839
expecting to see their wives

57:36.839 --> 57:39.922
and discovering they're now divorced.

57:41.427 --> 57:44.010
- Did that every happen to you?

57:48.809 --> 57:52.309
- My fiancee died while we were on patrol.

57:59.057 --> 58:03.057
When we tied up she had
been buried for 63 days.

58:05.840 --> 58:07.673
- Davie, I'm so sorry.

58:28.191 --> 58:29.858
- It was so strange.

58:34.317 --> 58:37.984
As far as I was concerned
she had just died.

58:39.412 --> 58:41.310
Everybody topside already got over it

58:41.310 --> 58:43.810
and moved on with their lives.

58:46.280 --> 58:49.447
That's when I started staying in here.

58:56.769 --> 59:01.186
In the sub I don't think
about things on the surface.

59:02.206 --> 59:04.480
- You don't get any news
while you're underwater?

59:04.480 --> 59:05.313
- Nope.

59:08.260 --> 59:10.462
The only messages the boat receives are if

59:10.462 --> 59:15.103
we need to nuke somebody
or destroy the world.

59:15.103 --> 59:19.773
The caption and XO are the only
ones who read the messages.

59:19.773 --> 59:21.273
- Total isolation.

59:27.226 --> 59:29.643
- I was just readin' my book.

59:31.067 --> 59:34.039
I don't wanna know what's
happening in the world.

59:34.039 --> 59:38.872
As long as I'm in the submarine,
the world doesn't change.

59:41.530 --> 59:42.697
- I guess not.

59:44.540 --> 59:46.297
Nobody in it but you.

59:50.044 --> 59:51.827
You're a coward, ya know.

59:51.827 --> 59:52.925
You're really just afraid

59:52.925 --> 59:55.842
of falling in love and being loved.

01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:10.375
- I guess I was afraid of falling in love.

01:00:12.115 --> 01:00:14.865
But now, I think I wouldn't mind.

01:00:16.452 --> 01:00:18.512
- Oh no you don't, Mr. Jonas.

01:00:18.512 --> 01:00:20.212
We're not falling in love.

01:00:20.212 --> 01:00:22.614
I mean, how can you even
expect me to be in love

01:00:22.614 --> 01:00:26.129
with a hermit who never
leaves his little motel room?

01:00:26.129 --> 01:00:29.717
- I can change by simply
walking out that door.

01:00:29.717 --> 01:00:31.812
- Haven't you noticed
what's happening to you?

01:00:31.812 --> 01:00:33.655
What's happening to this room?

01:00:41.994 --> 01:00:44.827
- I do seem to have gotten grayer.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:49.519
- You stopped time somehow.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.947
- Time doesn't move.

01:00:55.672 --> 01:00:57.172
Time doesn't move.

01:00:58.195 --> 01:01:00.257
- Well, it's moving now.

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:01.500
I mean, it might not be that easy

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.750
to just walk out that door.

01:01:04.803 --> 01:01:07.005
- You could stay here with me.

01:01:07.005 --> 01:01:09.713
- This
room is falling apart.

01:01:09.713 --> 01:01:11.757
- We can easily build you an extra bunk

01:01:11.757 --> 01:01:13.906
and you don't look like
you eat all that much.

01:01:13.906 --> 01:01:14.864
- It wouldn't work.

01:01:14.864 --> 01:01:16.166
I mean, I can't live like a hermit

01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:17.650
reading the same book every single day,

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:19.002
and besides, I eat more than you think I--

01:01:19.002 --> 01:01:19.835
- Jonnie!

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:22.494
I can change.

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:33.805
I need to leave this room.

01:01:52.193 --> 01:01:56.544
Looks like time's already
catching up to me.

01:01:56.544 --> 01:01:59.252
- I don't know about this.

01:02:01.466 --> 01:02:04.299
- Everyone lives on borrowed time.

01:02:24.039 --> 01:02:26.676
- Wait, close the door
before it's too late.

01:02:29.184 --> 01:02:30.017
Davie.

01:02:37.626 --> 01:02:42.126
- There's no time for love.

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:06.374
- Hold that.

01:04:27.134 --> 01:04:30.051
Ow!

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:34.235
When are you gonna get the
trunk lid fixed on our car?

01:04:34.235 --> 01:04:36.485
- I may never get it fixed.

01:04:40.472 --> 01:04:43.566
And it's not our car, it's my car,

01:04:43.566 --> 01:04:47.564
and I may just buy a whole
new ride after this deal.

01:04:47.564 --> 01:04:51.086
Recycle the old lead
sled back into the system

01:04:51.086 --> 01:04:52.753
from whence it came.

01:04:53.775 --> 01:04:56.300
- Ya know, you could
always just let me have it.

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.959
Like to sweeten up my end
of the deal a little bit.

01:04:58.959 --> 01:05:01.340
- You got to learn to
live within your means, T.

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:03.327
That old rust bucket still
gets by under its own power,

01:05:03.327 --> 01:05:05.343
which makes it worth at
least a hundred bucks.

01:05:05.343 --> 01:05:07.178
I ain't just gonna give it away.

01:05:07.178 --> 01:05:10.928
- Oh, well remember you
promised me 100 bucks

01:05:11.896 --> 01:05:13.980
to watch your back.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:14.895
- Yeah, I won't forget.

01:05:14.895 --> 01:05:16.412
I don't miss any details.

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:18.001
- Yeah, you'll forget if it suits you.

01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:20.140
- I won't forget your $100.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.346
- Ridin' shotgun for you

01:05:21.346 --> 01:05:24.678
isn't the safest activity I can think of.

01:05:24.678 --> 01:05:28.652
- Look, T, I've already
done all the dirty work.

01:05:28.652 --> 01:05:31.337
I located the goods and done
the breaking and entering.

01:05:31.337 --> 01:05:33.740
I acquired the merchandise
and made the getaway.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:37.340
All you gotta do is be
around during the transaction

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.000
so the buyer doesn't get any funny ideas.

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:49.484
- Oh, so that's the
merchandise, an old box.

01:05:50.914 --> 01:05:52.552
- It's not the box, you welter brain,

01:05:52.552 --> 01:05:53.925
it's what's in the box.

01:05:53.925 --> 01:05:55.592
- What's in the box?

01:05:56.492 --> 01:05:58.365
- Houdini's hand.

01:05:58.365 --> 01:06:00.061
- Say what?

01:06:00.061 --> 01:06:01.151
- Houdini's hand.

01:06:01.151 --> 01:06:02.705
- Oh!

01:06:02.705 --> 01:06:05.809
- It's Houdini's old mummified hand.

01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:08.858
- You mean, like, there's a
real dead guy's hand in there?

01:06:08.858 --> 01:06:11.375
Like, from that old dead magician?

01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:14.699
- Yeah, somebody cut it
off his body after he died.

01:06:14.699 --> 01:06:16.032
- Well, so what?

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.583
I mean, who would even want
some old dead thing like that?

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:20.788
- Lots of people.

01:06:20.788 --> 01:06:24.007
- Oh, lots, and what
would they do with it?

01:06:24.007 --> 01:06:25.541
- It's got uses.

01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:27.393
- Huh, what kind of uses?

01:06:27.393 --> 01:06:28.527
Like, what uses?

01:06:28.527 --> 01:06:29.360
It's dead!

01:06:30.608 --> 01:06:32.810
- I tell you I stole
it off of Stumpy Nixon?

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:35.788
- You mean the one-armed
burglar down in Atlanta?

01:06:35.788 --> 01:06:39.166
You stole that dead
hand from Stumpy Nixon?

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:41.204
- Yep, sure did.

01:06:41.204 --> 01:06:42.321
See, he left it in his flat when he went

01:06:42.321 --> 01:06:44.213
to go visit his girlfriend?

01:06:44.213 --> 01:06:45.379
When I go pay him a visit,

01:06:45.379 --> 01:06:47.428
I realize he's left his door unlocked.

01:06:47.428 --> 01:06:49.236
So I just pop in and lift it.

01:06:49.236 --> 01:06:53.356
He even left the bag
for me to carry it off with.

01:06:53.356 --> 01:06:57.783
- You stole that hand off
of a one-armed burglar.

01:06:57.783 --> 01:07:01.816
- Yeah, I guess it left him a
little shorthanded.

01:07:06.301 --> 01:07:08.967
- What was Stumpy Nixon
usin' that dead hand for?

01:07:08.967 --> 01:07:12.187
- Well I heard he was
usin' it to unlock doors

01:07:12.187 --> 01:07:14.266
and safes and stuff.

01:07:14.266 --> 01:07:18.358
I'm tellin' you, this thing is
valuable to the right people.

01:07:18.358 --> 01:07:20.847
- How does he do it?

01:07:20.847 --> 01:07:22.984
You know, like, how does Stumpy Nixon

01:07:22.984 --> 01:07:27.008
use an old dead hand to
open doors and safes?

01:07:27.008 --> 01:07:29.597
- Man, I don't know, he just does.

01:07:29.597 --> 01:07:31.517
He inherited it from some other old dude

01:07:31.517 --> 01:07:33.645
that was usin' it for the same thing.

01:07:33.645 --> 01:07:36.046
Somehow they use it.

01:07:36.046 --> 01:07:37.389
- Have you seen it?

01:07:37.389 --> 01:07:38.733
- What, the hand?

01:07:38.733 --> 01:07:40.195
- Yes, the hand.

01:07:40.195 --> 01:07:42.112
Have you seen the hand?

01:07:43.695 --> 01:07:45.695
- No, I haven't seen it.

01:07:46.665 --> 01:07:48.661
It's in a Chinese trickster box.

01:07:48.661 --> 01:07:51.684
You gotta slide a panel
this way and that way.

01:07:51.684 --> 01:07:53.324
It's like a puzzle.

01:07:53.324 --> 01:07:55.074
- Nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:07:56.962 --> 01:07:59.244
It's an ancient combination lock.

01:07:59.244 --> 01:08:02.265
I used to try to figure these things out.

01:08:02.265 --> 01:08:03.188
- Yeah.

01:08:03.188 --> 01:08:05.360
I'm gonna call my fence, Al Sharko.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.542
Man, this thing is worth 10K easy.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:08.625
- Yeah, yeah.

01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:47.492
- Sharko's Body Shop.

01:08:47.492 --> 01:08:49.010
- Hey, Al, it's Rufus.

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:50.229
How's it goin'?

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:51.569
- What do you want, Rufus?

01:08:51.569 --> 01:08:52.794
I'm here with my mother.

01:08:52.794 --> 01:08:54.734
- Tell your mom I said hi.

01:08:54.734 --> 01:08:57.844
- My mother despises vermin like you.

01:08:57.844 --> 01:08:59.179
What do you want?

01:08:59.179 --> 01:09:01.929
- Man, your mama's smart.

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:04.304
Listen, I got somethin' you want.

01:09:04.304 --> 01:09:05.794
- I doubt it.

01:09:05.794 --> 01:09:07.176
- Really, Al.

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:10.201
I managed to get my hands
on something quite valuable.

01:09:10.201 --> 01:09:13.573
- Ya gonna tell me what it
is before I die of old age?

01:09:13.573 --> 01:09:15.209
- Check this out.

01:09:15.209 --> 01:09:18.626
I have, in my possession, Houdini's hand.

01:09:20.374 --> 01:09:22.761
- Are you talkin' about
that thing that Stumpy Nixon

01:09:22.761 --> 01:09:25.591
uses to open safes and stuff?

01:09:25.591 --> 01:09:28.268
- Yeah, picked it up
right out of his flat.

01:09:28.268 --> 01:09:29.398
Check this out.

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:32.073
Stumpy Nixon left his door unlocked.

01:09:32.073 --> 01:09:35.127
- Stumpy Nixon always
leaves his door unlocked.

01:09:35.127 --> 01:09:36.796
It'd be a waste of time to lock his doors

01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:38.652
with that hand thing in there.

01:09:38.652 --> 01:09:40.589
That's what I'm tryin' to tell you, Al.

01:09:40.589 --> 01:09:42.826
This thing opens stuff.

01:09:42.826 --> 01:09:45.626
I figured you might know
someone who wants it.

01:09:45.626 --> 01:09:47.761
- Stumpy Nixon might want
it, and you'll be lucky

01:09:47.761 --> 01:09:50.051
if he takes it back
without a lotta trouble.

01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:52.421
- Man, I ain't afraid of
that one-armed safe cracker.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:55.164
- Well, you better be plenty worried.

01:09:55.164 --> 01:09:57.831
Nobody messes with Stumpy Nixon.

01:09:58.908 --> 01:10:01.321
Even the cops leave that guy alone.

01:10:01.321 --> 01:10:04.874
Couple years ago a
detective got on his trail.

01:10:04.874 --> 01:10:09.211
He woke up one morning
with his nose lopped off.

01:10:09.211 --> 01:10:11.592
Only a complete imbecile like you

01:10:11.592 --> 01:10:14.259
would steal Stumpy Nixon's hand.

01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:29.549
- Yo, T, how'd you open the box?

01:10:29.549 --> 01:10:32.020
- You know that bathroom
doesn't have any toilet paper?

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:34.722
Left me stranded, high and dry.

01:10:34.722 --> 01:10:37.664
- The box, T, how'd you open it?

01:10:37.664 --> 01:10:38.717
- Didn't touch it.

01:10:38.717 --> 01:10:41.666
I was in the bathroom while
you were talkin' to Al.

01:10:41.666 --> 01:10:43.914
What's that stuff in the box?

01:10:43.914 --> 01:10:46.026
Doesn't look like a hand to me.

01:10:46.026 --> 01:10:48.477
- Looks like rock salt.

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:50.397
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

01:10:50.397 --> 01:10:51.300
It's rock salt.

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.058
They put it in there to preserve the hand.

01:10:54.502 --> 01:10:56.907
- Yep, that's rock salt.

01:10:56.907 --> 01:11:01.407
- Man, get that trash can
so we can put this in there.

01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:12.344
- No hand.

01:11:12.344 --> 01:11:16.261
There isn't anything in
that box but rock salt.

01:11:26.051 --> 01:11:27.211
- Change your mind?

01:11:27.211 --> 01:11:28.887
- You've got my hand.

01:11:32.128 --> 01:11:34.711
- Well, did Al Sharko call you?

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:38.393
- No, Al Sharko didn't call me.

01:11:38.393 --> 01:11:41.824
You were tryin' to sell
it to Al, weren't you?

01:11:41.824 --> 01:11:43.155
- Well--

01:11:43.155 --> 01:11:45.609
- You thought you
could just steal my hand

01:11:45.609 --> 01:11:47.609
and sell it, didn't you?

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:51.941
- Well, to be perfectly
honest with you, Stumpy--

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:54.167
- That's Mr. Nixon to you.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.655
You've never been perfectly
honest with anyone

01:11:59.655 --> 01:12:02.069
in your whole miserable life.

01:12:02.069 --> 01:12:06.486
You've got my hand, and I
want it back with interest.

01:12:09.702 --> 01:12:14.457
- Okay, Mr. Nixon, I have
what you're lookin' for.

01:12:14.457 --> 01:12:16.271
What's it worth to you?

01:12:16.271 --> 01:12:21.271
- What's it
worth to me?

01:12:26.364 --> 01:12:30.870
To be perfectly honest with you

01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:34.746
I'll tell you what it's worth to you.

01:12:34.746 --> 01:12:38.429
The way I see it, you took my hand.

01:12:38.429 --> 01:12:42.800
I want my hand back and
now I want one of yours.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.633
- What?

01:12:43.633 --> 01:12:44.466
My hand?

01:12:44.466 --> 01:12:45.700
You're crazy.

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:49.558
- You guys better
seriously consider my offer.

01:12:49.558 --> 01:12:52.729
And remember, I want my hand back

01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:55.431
and I want one of yours in interest.

01:12:55.431 --> 01:12:59.113
And listen, Rufus, I'm on
my way over there to get it.

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.100
- Who was that?

01:13:09.958 --> 01:13:12.348
Was that Stumpy Nixon?

01:13:12.348 --> 01:13:13.598
What'd he want?

01:13:14.962 --> 01:13:15.795
- My hand.

01:13:18.184 --> 01:13:22.543
Says he wants my hand in
interest for takin' his.

01:13:22.543 --> 01:13:24.310
- How does he expect you to do that?

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:26.385
Saw off your own hand?

01:13:26.385 --> 01:13:27.468
- I guess so.

01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:35.279
- Burn the witch!

01:13:35.279 --> 01:13:36.914
Burn her, burn the witch!

01:13:36.914 --> 01:13:38.997
Burn her, burn her, burn.

01:13:43.533 --> 01:13:46.201
- You think the hand did that?

01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:48.507
- I don't know.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:51.096
- You know it's out that box,

01:13:51.096 --> 01:13:53.745
and it's in this room somewhere.

01:13:53.745 --> 01:13:54.744
- I don't know, T.

01:13:54.744 --> 01:13:56.894
I don't think it can think it
can do somethin' like that.

01:13:56.894 --> 01:13:58.104
- It's in here.

01:13:58.104 --> 01:14:01.796
It just turned on that
TV, it's in here ya know.

01:14:01.796 --> 01:14:03.424
- Come over here and help me move this out

01:14:03.424 --> 01:14:04.888
so we can look behind it.

01:14:04.888 --> 01:14:06.302
- Nah, nah, I'm good.

01:14:06.302 --> 01:14:09.802
- Don't be a wuss, get over here, come on.

01:14:11.604 --> 01:14:12.531
Ready, on three.

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:14.781
- Uh-huh.
- One, two, three.

01:14:16.011 --> 01:14:18.480
Don't pick up your end or anything.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.480
- Nothin' back there but old
dust bunnies the size of cats.

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.151
- Tyrone Thaddeus.

01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:45.198
So you're watchin' Rufus's back
for a measly hundred bucks?

01:14:45.198 --> 01:14:46.839
- Yeah, how'd you know that?

01:14:46.839 --> 01:14:49.010
- I know a lot, Tyrone.

01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:51.165
I know that after Rufus
gets through settling up

01:14:51.165 --> 01:14:55.551
with me, he's not gonna have
your measly hundred bucks.

01:14:55.551 --> 01:15:00.551
Rufus is the one who's gonna
come up shorthanded.

01:15:12.366 --> 01:15:14.574
- Hey, Rufus, the hand just locked us in.

01:15:14.574 --> 01:15:16.291
- Man, get out the way.

01:15:16.291 --> 01:15:18.124
Move, get out the way.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.267
How'd it do that?

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:23.350
- The window.

01:15:24.897 --> 01:15:27.847
The window's all boarded up.

01:15:27.847 --> 01:15:29.344
How are we gonna get out now?

01:15:29.344 --> 01:15:31.300
- We got a bag full of tools.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.239
In case you forget, remember we break

01:15:33.239 --> 01:15:35.063
into places for a living?

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.350
- Oh yeah.

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:37.500
We can get outta here.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.333
- Yeah.
- All right?

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:39.166
Let's go.

01:15:44.848 --> 01:15:46.832
Hey, Rufus, where's your crowbar?

01:15:46.832 --> 01:15:47.754
- I lost it.

01:15:47.754 --> 01:15:49.050
It fell off the roof at the Piggly Wiggly

01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:50.109
back in the green room.

01:15:50.109 --> 01:15:51.495
- And you never got another one?

01:15:51.495 --> 01:15:53.232
- Never needed another one.

01:15:53.232 --> 01:15:54.570
- 'Til now.

01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:55.979
- Yeah, 'til now.

01:15:55.979 --> 01:15:57.229
- Hey!

01:15:58.297 --> 01:15:59.625
Hey!

01:15:59.625 --> 01:16:01.208
I know you hear me.

01:16:04.108 --> 01:16:06.513
When you shysters gon'
stop messin' around?

01:16:06.513 --> 01:16:08.211
You need to get that hand ready for me

01:16:08.211 --> 01:16:11.794
because I'm on my way
over there to get it.

01:16:13.263 --> 01:16:14.096
- Okay.

01:16:20.646 --> 01:16:22.364
- Hey, Rufus.

01:16:22.364 --> 01:16:25.624
What you gon' do with that saw?

01:16:25.624 --> 01:16:29.167
Hope you're not thinkin'
what I think you're thinkin'.

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:31.378
- No, I'm not thinkin' what
you think I'm thinkin'.

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:33.019
I know one thing, we
need to figure out a way

01:16:33.019 --> 01:16:34.022
to get outta this room before--

01:16:37.016 --> 01:16:38.513
- The hand.

01:16:38.513 --> 01:16:40.169
It's hangin' around this table.

01:16:40.169 --> 01:16:41.785
- Tyrone.

01:16:41.785 --> 01:16:42.618
Tyrone.

01:16:43.787 --> 01:16:44.620
Tyrone.

01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:47.926
I know you hear me, boy.

01:16:47.926 --> 01:16:49.343
Is that you, boy?

01:16:54.925 --> 01:16:56.307
- Yes, this is I.

01:16:56.307 --> 01:16:58.646
- I've got
some good news, Tyrone,

01:16:58.646 --> 01:17:00.558
and I got some bad news.

01:17:04.289 --> 01:17:06.831
The good news is I don't have my heart

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:09.081
set on takin' Rufus's hand.

01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:11.675
- That is some good news.

01:17:11.675 --> 01:17:13.208
- Yep, and the
bad news is your hand

01:17:13.208 --> 01:17:15.921
will also be satisfactory.

01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:18.046
- Oh, whoa, oh, oh, why my hand?

01:17:18.046 --> 01:17:19.738
- Well any hand will do

01:17:19.738 --> 01:17:21.700
as long as you crooks come up with a hand.

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.901
You're just fortunate I don't want

01:17:22.901 --> 01:17:26.818
your arm or your leg.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:36.367
- We've gotta get outta here.

01:17:41.483 --> 01:17:44.242
Looks like they screwed these boards on.

01:17:44.242 --> 01:17:46.159
They're not pryin' off.

01:17:47.235 --> 01:17:48.732
Oh, oh.

01:18:06.079 --> 01:18:08.146
Oh, Rufus.

01:18:08.146 --> 01:18:12.268
Ah, come here.

01:18:12.268 --> 01:18:13.101
Rufus.

01:18:14.237 --> 01:18:15.570
You nearly died.

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:20.931
You peed your pants and you nearly died.

01:18:20.931 --> 01:18:22.704
- It's that hand.

01:18:22.704 --> 01:18:23.726
It's tryin' to kill us.

01:18:23.726 --> 01:18:25.393
- Yeah it is, it is!

01:18:26.906 --> 01:18:28.548
It's way back in its box.

01:18:28.548 --> 01:18:30.210
- Get it, go, get it.

01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:31.151
Close the lid.

01:18:31.151 --> 01:18:32.479
- Move out the way.
- Get it down.

01:18:32.479 --> 01:18:33.312
- Ah!

01:18:34.675 --> 01:18:36.572
- Get somethin' out of this bag.

01:18:36.572 --> 01:18:37.867
Anything!

01:18:37.867 --> 01:18:39.725
What can we use?

01:18:46.133 --> 01:18:47.878
I can't find anything.

01:18:56.307 --> 01:18:59.724
We need a hand for when Stumpy gets here.

01:19:04.261 --> 01:19:05.428
- Yeah, we do.

01:19:21.932 --> 01:19:25.375
- I see you had a little
run in with my hand.

01:19:25.375 --> 01:19:26.208
- Uh-huh.

01:19:27.487 --> 01:19:30.804
- Tell me, Tyrone, what did
you learn from all of this?

01:19:35.779 --> 01:19:38.217
- Don't mess around with Stumpy Nixon.

01:19:38.217 --> 01:19:42.300
- Let me give you a little
bit of advice, Tyrone.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:47.759
Hangin' out with big dummies
like Rufus right there,

01:19:47.759 --> 01:19:50.676
you're gon' end up just like Rufus.

01:19:52.561 --> 01:19:54.394
- Hey, 'ey, Mr. Nixon.

01:19:57.417 --> 01:20:00.043
What you want me to do with this?

01:20:00.043 --> 01:20:03.339
- Ah yes, the interest on my property.

01:20:03.339 --> 01:20:05.687
I don't think I'll be takin' that today.

01:20:05.687 --> 01:20:10.477
It's not my color, plus
it smells bad.

01:20:10.477 --> 01:20:11.310
Ho!

01:20:13.835 --> 01:20:16.765
Stumpy Nixon, you better tell somebody.

01:20:42.613 --> 01:20:45.280
- Woo!

01:20:46.796 --> 01:20:49.296
Oh.

01:20:50.806 --> 01:20:51.639
Oh.
