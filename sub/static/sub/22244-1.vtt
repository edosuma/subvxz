[music playing]

00:30.489 --> 00:34.409
The first time I saw Lindy Hop,

00:30.489 --> 00:34.409
I was 18 years old,

00:34.451 --> 00:37.705
I was a freshman

00:34.451 --> 00:37.705
at the University

00:34.451 --> 00:37.705
of Texas at Austin,

00:37.746 --> 00:40.290
and it was to Duke Ellington's

00:37.746 --> 00:40.290
"Rockin' in Rhythm."

00:40.332 --> 00:42.710
And it was

00:40.332 --> 00:42.710
four couples onstage,

00:42.751 --> 00:45.754
and they were throwing aerials,

00:42.751 --> 00:45.754
and it was so incredible

00:45.796 --> 00:47.548
and playful and fun and magical,

00:47.589 --> 00:48.590
and I saw this,

00:47.589 --> 00:48.590
and I was like...

00:48.632 --> 00:51.385
[squeals]

00:51.426 --> 00:54.596
"I have to do that.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.596
I have to do that."

00:54.638 --> 00:57.057
MAN: I'm a swing dancer,

00:54.638 --> 00:57.057
'cause I fell in love

00:54.638 --> 00:57.057
with it.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.099
Most importantly,

00:57.098 --> 00:58.099
it's the music

00:58.141 --> 01:00.561
that keeps me

00:58.141 --> 01:00.561
coming back,

01:00.602 --> 01:02.646
so I'll always dance.

01:02.688 --> 01:07.234
Lindy Hop is so free.

01:02.688 --> 01:07.234
It's so fun.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.821
You know?

01:07.275 --> 01:10.821
And anything goes.

01:10.863 --> 01:14.992
It's so hard

01:10.863 --> 01:14.992
to explain to nondancers

01:10.863 --> 01:14.992
this obsession.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.912
They--I don't think

01:15.034 --> 01:17.912
they really get it.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.455
To dance

01:17.953 --> 01:20.455
with another person

01:20.497 --> 01:23.625
and to find

01:20.497 --> 01:23.625
the connection,

01:20.497 --> 01:23.625
it is like--

01:23.667 --> 01:26.085
like having sex when

01:23.667 --> 01:26.085
you are on amphetamine

01:23.667 --> 01:26.085
or something.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.201
WOMAN: I think the way

02:37.574 --> 02:40.201
that our society

02:37.574 --> 02:40.201
is built right now,

02:40.243 --> 02:43.038
a lot of people,

02:40.243 --> 02:43.038
they're so isolated,

02:43.080 --> 02:46.333
They really, really live

02:43.080 --> 02:46.333
lives of quiet desperation.

02:46.374 --> 02:50.211
They get up in the morning,

02:46.374 --> 02:50.211
they go to work,

02:50.253 --> 02:52.840
they come home,

02:50.253 --> 02:52.840
they sit home by themselves

02:50.253 --> 02:52.840
and watch TV,

02:52.881 --> 02:56.217
maybe they go to the mall,

02:52.881 --> 02:56.217
go to bed,

02:56.259 --> 02:59.847
get up the next day,

02:56.259 --> 02:59.847
and the same thing

02:56.259 --> 02:59.847
repeats, repeats.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.849
We're just becoming

02:59.888 --> 03:01.849
more isolated.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.059
I like to think that

03:01.890 --> 03:04.059
I'm the last generation

03:04.101 --> 03:05.853
that grew up outside.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.853
We'd go outside

03:04.101 --> 03:05.853
and ride our bikes.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.729
There was interaction.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.729
You went to school.

03:07.771 --> 03:08.897
You had recess.

03:07.771 --> 03:08.897
You played games.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.190
You know,

03:08.939 --> 03:11.190
now it's video games,

03:11.232 --> 03:13.735
it's isolation,

03:11.232 --> 03:13.735
and it's hard

03:11.232 --> 03:13.735
for people to relate.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.737
I don't think people

03:13.777 --> 03:15.737
have the skills

03:15.779 --> 03:16.363
at personal interaction

03:15.779 --> 03:16.363
anymore.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.201
The world

03:19.324 --> 03:22.201
is becoming kind of

03:19.324 --> 03:22.201
a spectator sport.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.039
It used to be

03:22.243 --> 03:25.039
you'd go to a concert,

03:25.080 --> 03:26.748
and everyone was

03:25.080 --> 03:26.748
singing along and

03:25.080 --> 03:26.748
getting into the moment.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.542
Now you go to a concert,

03:28.583 --> 03:29.626
and people

03:28.583 --> 03:29.626
are like this...

03:29.668 --> 03:31.879
with their phones.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.797
It's all about

03:31.920 --> 03:33.797
Facebook, texting,

03:33.839 --> 03:36.925
I.M.ing, e-mails,

03:33.839 --> 03:36.925
cell phones.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.135
I mean, people prefer

03:36.967 --> 03:38.135
to text over even

03:36.967 --> 03:38.135
talk to each other.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.389
And thank God

03:40.470 --> 03:42.389

04:26.225 --> 04:28.018
that it was possible

04:26.225 --> 04:28.018

with a living.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.080
If they

06:10.411 --> 06:12.080
wanted big money,

they would, like,

06:12.122 --> 06:13.581

06:13.623 --> 06:15.042
sort of

06:13.623 --> 06:15.042

from New York City,

06:26.761 --> 06:29.931
a larger amount of money

06:26.761 --> 06:29.931
in one weekend from my work.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.979
You develop

this family of dancers

06:33.352 --> 06:35.979
that's on the circuit,

06:36.021 --> 06:38.065
and they become

06:36.021 --> 06:38.065
like really good friends,

06:38.106 --> 06:39.274

Steve and I

kind of nice,

08:22.794 --> 08:26.089
wanted to move to L.A.

08:22.794 --> 08:26.089
because of dancing.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.175
They called it

08:26.131 --> 08:28.175
Hollywood style.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.385
You know, it's just

08:28.216 --> 08:30.385
a lot smoother of a dance,

uh, cool,

08:30.427 --> 08:32.346

08:51.948 --> 08:53.283
Yes, we are nervous.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.283
Yeah.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.036
Uhh.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.124
Most people

08:58.413 --> 09:01.124
don't even realize

09:01.166 --> 09:03.043
that swing dancing

09:01.166 --> 09:03.043
competitions aren't

09:01.166 --> 09:03.043
choreographed.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.044
It's all improvised.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.088
You can practice

09:05.795 --> 09:07.088
with your partner

09:07.130 --> 09:08.048
long before

09:07.130 --> 09:08.048
competition,

09:08.089 --> 09:10.258
but when you

09:08.089 --> 09:10.258
get there,

09:10.300 --> 09:12.219
you have no idea

09:10.300 --> 09:12.219
what music they're

09:10.300 --> 09:12.219
going to play,

09:12.260 --> 09:14.554
you don't know

09:12.260 --> 09:14.554
how fast it's

09:12.260 --> 09:14.554
going to be,

09:14.595 --> 09:16.223
and you have no idea

09:14.595 --> 09:16.223
when you're gonna

09:14.595 --> 09:16.223
get called out either.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.392
If you do

09:16.264 --> 09:18.392
something badass

09:16.264 --> 09:18.392
in a contest,

09:18.433 --> 09:20.101
all of the other

09:18.433 --> 09:20.101
Lindy Hoppers

09:18.433 --> 09:20.101
in the world

09:20.143 --> 09:21.478
are watching that

09:20.143 --> 09:21.478
on YouTube,

09:21.520 --> 09:23.771
and if they liked

09:21.520 --> 09:23.771
that stuff you did,

09:23.813 --> 09:25.815
they're gonna bring you

09:23.813 --> 09:25.815
to their city,

09:25.857 --> 09:27.608
and then you're

09:25.857 --> 09:27.608
gonna get hired

09:25.857 --> 09:27.608
for a teaching gig,

09:27.650 --> 09:28.735
and that's how

09:27.650 --> 09:28.735
Lindy Hop instructors

09:28.776 --> 09:30.570
sort of

09:28.776 --> 09:30.570
make their living.

09:30.611 --> 09:34.241
CHANZIE: We're

09:30.611 --> 09:34.241
a new partnership,

09:30.611 --> 09:34.241
so--

09:34.282 --> 09:36.743
Been together

09:34.282 --> 09:36.743
for, like, half a year.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.329
Of course

09:36.784 --> 09:39.329
we want to represent

09:36.784 --> 09:39.329
real well, you know.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.456
Hopefully this

09:39.371 --> 09:41.456
will help us to teach.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.917
We want to try--

09:41.498 --> 09:43.917
try to go somewhere

09:41.498 --> 09:43.917
with it.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.093
[swing music playing]

09:59.807 --> 10:02.852
So the history, kind of,

09:59.807 --> 10:02.852
of this swing bubble

09:59.807 --> 10:02.852
that we live in.

10:02.894 --> 10:05.272
Here's the swing bubble,

10:02.894 --> 10:05.272
Oh, Jo's got it.

10:02.894 --> 10:05.272
Swing bubble.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.940
Got the swing bubble.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.940
Inside the swing bubble,

10:05.313 --> 10:06.940
we've got Lindy Hop,

10:06.981 --> 10:08.358
we've got

10:06.981 --> 10:08.358
East Coast Swing,

10:08.400 --> 10:09.443
West Coast Swing,

10:08.400 --> 10:09.443

10:09.484 --> 10:11.194

10:09.484 --> 10:11.194
Carolina Shag,

10:11.236 --> 10:13.654

10:11.236 --> 10:13.654
St. Louis Shag...

10:13.696 --> 10:15.698
D.C. Hand Dancing...

10:13.696 --> 10:15.698
D.C. Hand Dancing.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.618
We've got

10:15.740 --> 10:18.618
Cajun Zydeco Dancing.

10:18.659 --> 10:19.536
We've got

10:18.659 --> 10:19.536
Boogie-Woogie.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.621
We've got

10:19.578 --> 10:21.621
Rock n Roll.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.705
We've got Bugg,

10:21.662 --> 10:22.705
Swedish Bugg,

10:22.747 --> 10:24.374
and we got Double Bug,

10:24.416 --> 10:26.293
and it just goes

10:24.416 --> 10:26.293
on and on from there.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.378
They're all

10:26.334 --> 10:28.378
in part of-

10:28.420 --> 10:31.131
encased

10:28.420 --> 10:31.131
in the swing jazz era

10:28.420 --> 10:31.131
genre of dancing.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.800
MAN: Lindy Hop

10:31.172 --> 10:33.800
is the original

10:31.172 --> 10:33.800
American swing dance,

10:33.841 --> 10:36.970
and from this dance,

10:33.841 --> 10:36.970
we've had so many branches

10:37.011 --> 10:39.389
come off of this amazing,

10:37.011 --> 10:39.389
beautiful, wonderful tree.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.224
And even

10:39.431 --> 10:41.224
a lot of the moves

10:39.431 --> 10:41.224
that you see

10:41.266 --> 10:43.351
in hip-hop and

10:41.266 --> 10:43.351
other dances today

10:43.393 --> 10:46.563
are coming from

10:43.393 --> 10:46.563
this exact same spot.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.357
When you Lindy Hopping,

10:46.605 --> 10:49.357
you're swinging, honey.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.025
I mean,

10:49.399 --> 10:51.025
you swinging, baby.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.402
[laughs]

10:52.444 --> 10:55.696
[swing music playing]

10:55.738 --> 10:58.741
KEVIN: The swing-out

10:55.738 --> 10:58.741
is the Holy Grail

10:55.738 --> 10:58.741
of Lindy Hop.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.535
It's the one move

10:58.783 --> 11:00.535
that you can never

10:58.783 --> 11:00.535
do enough.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.749
You have

11:03.871 --> 11:06.749
this syncopation

11:03.871 --> 11:06.749
and this stretch

11:06.791 --> 11:09.544
and this

11:06.791 --> 11:09.544
pull in of energy,

11:09.586 --> 11:13.214
and it whips around and

11:09.586 --> 11:13.214
slingshots your partner

11:09.586 --> 11:13.214
away from you.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.258
She goes out so fast,

11:13.256 --> 11:15.258
you're thinking she's

11:13.256 --> 11:15.258
never gonna stop,

11:15.300 --> 11:16.510
but there's

11:15.300 --> 11:16.510
this lifeline

11:16.551 --> 11:18.595
of the leader

11:16.551 --> 11:18.595
holding on,

11:18.637 --> 11:21.222
and brings

11:18.637 --> 11:21.222
the follow right back

11:18.637 --> 11:21.222
into their arms

11:21.264 --> 11:23.183
and continues

11:21.264 --> 11:23.183
and does it again.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.935
Every dance

11:23.224 --> 11:25.935
has its own mood,

11:25.977 --> 11:28.855
and so I think that tango

11:25.977 --> 11:28.855
is very dramatic,

11:28.896 --> 11:30.689
and West Coast Swing

11:28.896 --> 11:30.689
can be sultry,

11:30.731 --> 11:32.691
and Salsa is sexy,

11:32.733 --> 11:35.694
but Lindy Hop is silly.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.694
It's ridiculous.

11:40.908 --> 11:45.246
Have you seen

11:40.908 --> 11:45.246
these kinds of moves

11:40.908 --> 11:45.246
in, like, ballroom?

11:45.288 --> 11:47.457
In ballroom dancing,

11:45.288 --> 11:47.457
you have rules.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.250
Your hand

11:47.499 --> 11:49.250
must be here.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.252
Your head

11:49.292 --> 11:51.252
must be here.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.922
You can't

11:51.294 --> 11:54.922
pass rules on swing.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.633
EVITA: There is no clean,

11:54.964 --> 11:56.633
perfect, technical position

11:56.675 --> 11:58.717
a lot of times

11:56.675 --> 11:58.717
in Lindy Hop,

11:58.759 --> 12:01.262
and so you have

11:58.759 --> 12:01.262
the freedom to go for it,

12:01.304 --> 12:03.598
to just, like, throw

12:01.304 --> 12:03.598
your arms up, you know?

12:03.640 --> 12:05.099
Like, kick your foot!

12:03.640 --> 12:05.099
I mean, it's--

12:05.141 --> 12:09.062
It's freeing, you know?

12:09.103 --> 12:12.773
And there's

12:09.103 --> 12:12.773
actually less mistakes

12:09.103 --> 12:12.773
that are even possible,

12:12.815 --> 12:15.443
because there is no mistake.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.735
[swing music playing]

12:21.824 --> 12:23.159
Ready?

12:21.824 --> 12:23.159
Yeah.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.163
[man laughs]

12:27.205 --> 12:29.082
Yeah,

12:27.205 --> 12:29.082
so that's the--

12:29.123 --> 12:31.585
That's the--

12:31.626 --> 12:35.422
That's the first

12:31.626 --> 12:35.422
aerial that was

12:31.626 --> 12:35.422
ever created.

12:35.463 --> 12:40.427
Swing dancing

12:35.463 --> 12:40.427
is a traditional

12:35.463 --> 12:40.427
man-woman-couple thing,

12:40.468 --> 12:42.512
and very few women

12:42.554 --> 12:44.639
dare to do this...

12:42.554 --> 12:44.639
Yeah.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.601
I think,

12:44.681 --> 12:47.601
without the man.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.935
[swing music playing]

13:19.006 --> 13:22.051
For me,

13:19.006 --> 13:22.051
it's also political.

13:22.093 --> 13:26.723
It's important

13:22.093 --> 13:26.723
to be able to do things

13:22.093 --> 13:26.723
as partners.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.476
Even though

13:26.765 --> 13:29.476
you're not lovers.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.061
Because it has

13:29.517 --> 13:32.061
happened a lot for men

13:32.103 --> 13:33.980
throughout history,

13:32.103 --> 13:33.980

13:34.021 --> 13:36.483

Women need to be

13:48.369 --> 13:52.873
so much better

13:48.369 --> 13:52.873
as a couple.

13:52.915 --> 13:57.211
Competitive dancers

13:52.915 --> 13:57.211
don't see us

13:52.915 --> 13:57.211
as a threat

13:57.253 --> 14:00.674
until we are

13:57.253 --> 14:00.674
actually, like, there.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.342
Our first song--

14:02.383 --> 14:06.845
I think it's nice

14:02.383 --> 14:06.845
to play, like, harmless.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.724
That's a Swedish thing,

14:06.887 --> 14:09.724
to be more underdogs.

14:09.766 --> 14:10.891
That's really Swedish.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.185
[swing music playing]

14:17.898 --> 14:21.194
Swing dancing started

14:17.898 --> 14:21.194
in the late 1920s

14:17.898 --> 14:21.194
and early '30s,

14:21.235 --> 14:23.363
when our country

14:21.235 --> 14:23.363
was in the depths

14:23.404 --> 14:25.198
of the worst depression

14:23.404 --> 14:25.198
it had ever known.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.040
EVITA:

14:31.245 --> 14:34.040
People were so fallen.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.292
They just

14:34.081 --> 14:36.292
lost everything,

14:36.334 --> 14:39.546
and the music

14:36.334 --> 14:39.546
and the dance

14:36.334 --> 14:39.546
and the movement,

14:39.587 --> 14:43.216
its purpose

14:39.587 --> 14:43.216
was to elevate people,

14:39.587 --> 14:43.216
to raise their spirits,

14:43.257 --> 14:45.802
to let them

14:43.257 --> 14:45.802
laugh and smile for--

14:43.257 --> 14:45.802
even for a moment.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.721
[swing music playing]

14:58.439 --> 15:02.318
It was the one relief

14:58.439 --> 15:02.318
you had from the bad times.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.738
They would work hard

15:02.360 --> 15:04.738
and save--

15:04.779 --> 15:08.408
save their pennies,

15:04.779 --> 15:08.408
save their dimes

15:08.449 --> 15:10.660
so that they could

15:08.449 --> 15:10.660
go out once or twice

15:08.449 --> 15:10.660
a week and go dancing.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.749
ANDREA: This dance

15:13.872 --> 15:15.749
was born with

15:13.872 --> 15:15.749
the black community.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.251
It started out

15:15.790 --> 15:18.251
as a street dance

15:15.790 --> 15:18.251
in Harlem.

15:18.292 --> 15:21.921
African-Americans

15:18.292 --> 15:21.921
danced on sidewalks

15:18.292 --> 15:21.921
and roads,

15:21.962 --> 15:23.631
and eventually

15:21.962 --> 15:23.631
they brought it

15:21.962 --> 15:23.631
into the ballroom.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.426
It's our music.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.010
Louis Armstrong

15:26.467 --> 15:28.010
gave us the sound...

15:30.388 --> 15:31.931
Basie gave us

15:30.388 --> 15:31.931
the beat,

15:31.972 --> 15:34.308
and Duke Ellington

15:31.972 --> 15:34.308
told you

15:34.350 --> 15:37.270
it don't mean a thing

15:34.350 --> 15:37.270
if it ain't got

15:34.350 --> 15:37.270
that swing.

15:37.311 --> 15:41.357
How can you

15:37.311 --> 15:41.357
listen to that music

15:37.311 --> 15:41.357
and not pat your foot?

15:41.399 --> 15:44.151
EVITA: It was

15:41.399 --> 15:44.151
that essence

15:41.399 --> 15:44.151
of the dance,

15:44.193 --> 15:47.864
that striving

15:44.193 --> 15:47.864
for happiness,

15:47.906 --> 15:52.452
striving for joy

15:47.906 --> 15:52.452
amongst all odds

15:52.493 --> 15:54.454
that inspired

15:52.493 --> 15:54.454
the world.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.627
Lindy Hop was featured

15:57.998 --> 16:00.627
in a lot of ballrooms

15:57.998 --> 16:00.627
in Harlem,

16:00.668 --> 16:03.713
but the Savoy Ballroom

16:00.668 --> 16:03.713
was the first to allow

16:03.755 --> 16:06.633
black people and

16:03.755 --> 16:06.633
white people to dance

16:03.755 --> 16:06.633
together socially.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.718
You're talking

16:06.674 --> 16:08.718
about a time

16:08.760 --> 16:11.471
when Harlem

16:08.760 --> 16:11.471
is white people's

16:08.760 --> 16:11.471
playground.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.139
You had the Cotton Club

16:11.512 --> 16:13.139
up the street.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.849
White people went in.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.476
Black people

16:14.891 --> 16:16.476
was the dancers.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.478
They couldn't go

16:16.517 --> 16:18.478
through the front door.

16:18.519 --> 16:23.149
And here was a ballroom

16:18.519 --> 16:23.149
in the center of Harlem,

16:23.190 --> 16:26.736
and when

16:23.190 --> 16:26.736
those doors opened,

16:23.190 --> 16:26.736
you got white people,

16:26.778 --> 16:29.530
but here came

16:26.778 --> 16:29.530
the black people going

16:26.778 --> 16:29.530
through the same door.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.698
No other club

16:29.572 --> 16:30.698
in Harlem did that.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.999
The first generation

16:37.538 --> 16:39.999
of Lindy Hoppers

16:40.040 --> 16:42.335
got their start there,

16:40.040 --> 16:42.335
but then it got perfected

16:42.376 --> 16:44.337
and really

16:42.376 --> 16:44.337
went to Hollywood

16:44.378 --> 16:45.839
through Norma Miller

16:44.378 --> 16:45.839
and Frankie Manning's group,

16:45.880 --> 16:46.840
the Whitey's Lindy Hoppers.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.388
NORMA: There was

16:52.887 --> 16:54.388
a knock on my door.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.558
It was Whitey.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.059
And he said,

16:57.600 --> 16:59.059
"I would like for you

16:59.101 --> 17:01.521
"to come

16:59.101 --> 17:01.521
and dance with us,

17:01.562 --> 17:02.563
'cause I'd rather

17:01.562 --> 17:02.563
you dance with us

17:01.562 --> 17:02.563
than against us."

17:08.486 --> 17:13.574
Frankie Manning has

17:08.486 --> 17:13.574
a reach so far and wide

17:08.486 --> 17:13.574
in Lindy Hop

17:13.616 --> 17:17.369
that you

17:13.616 --> 17:17.369
can't Lindy Hop and

17:13.616 --> 17:17.369
not know about him.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.748
RUSTY: Frankie was one

17:17.411 --> 17:20.748
of the main choreographers

17:17.411 --> 17:20.748
for this group,

17:20.790 --> 17:23.083
and he came up

17:20.790 --> 17:23.083
with the first aerial.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.755
I just danced.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.219
Swing dancing

17:30.633 --> 17:33.219
was the hot thing,

17:33.260 --> 17:36.639
and then it was

17:33.260 --> 17:36.639
nonexistent pretty much,

17:33.260 --> 17:36.639
for decades.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.432
The reason

17:36.681 --> 17:38.432
the swing dancing died

17:38.474 --> 17:39.934
was that people

17:38.474 --> 17:39.934
stopped going.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.229
The soldiers came home.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.605
Everybody just wanted

17:43.270 --> 17:44.605
to start families, and

17:43.270 --> 17:44.605
they stopped going out.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.734
I left the Lindy Hop,

17:44.647 --> 17:47.734
period.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.402
I left the Savoy.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.402
You could--

17:49.443 --> 17:51.738
There were no jobs!

17:51.779 --> 17:53.907
Frankie went

17:51.779 --> 17:53.907
to the post office

17:51.779 --> 17:53.907
to make a living,

17:53.948 --> 17:56.910
and he really felt

17:53.948 --> 17:56.910
people should be

17:53.948 --> 17:56.910
responsible

17:56.951 --> 17:58.494
and make a living,

17:56.951 --> 17:58.494
felt very strongly

17:56.951 --> 17:58.494
about it.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.747
I just went in there

17:58.536 --> 18:00.747
with the idea

18:00.788 --> 18:03.499
that I was only

18:00.788 --> 18:03.499
gonna be there

18:00.788 --> 18:03.499
a short period of time.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.752
They knew that I had

18:03.541 --> 18:05.752
been in show business,

18:05.793 --> 18:07.962
but I didn't

18:05.793 --> 18:07.962
expound on that.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.757
I didn't say,

18:08.004 --> 18:10.757
"Well, yeah, I did this.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.757
I did that."

18:10.798 --> 18:13.760
And so there's

18:10.798 --> 18:13.760
this long period

18:10.798 --> 18:13.760
of total irrelevance.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.262
[laughs]

18:16.303 --> 18:18.097
You know, we're talking,

18:16.303 --> 18:18.097
like, 30, 40 years.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.436
No.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.938
[swing music playing]

18:45.875 --> 18:47.126
[smooth jazz playing]

19:04.018 --> 19:07.855
I run Camp Hollywood

19:07.897 --> 19:10.357
and the National

19:07.897 --> 19:10.357
Jitterbug Championships,

19:10.399 --> 19:13.736
which is kind of like

19:10.399 --> 19:13.736
a long weekend convention

19:10.399 --> 19:13.736
for swing dancers,

19:13.778 --> 19:16.530
and I've done that

19:13.778 --> 19:16.530
since 1998.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.158
It took off, and I

19:16.572 --> 19:19.158
don't think at the time

19:19.199 --> 19:22.369
I intended it

19:19.199 --> 19:22.369
to be a yearly event,

19:22.411 --> 19:25.915
but it quickly became clear

19:22.411 --> 19:25.915
that it should be.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.333
1, 2

19:27.374 --> 19:28.751
1, 2, 3, 4

19:28.793 --> 19:30.503
[cheering]

19:37.551 --> 19:39.679
We'll tell people,

19:37.551 --> 19:39.679
"Oh, we're going

19:37.551 --> 19:39.679
to this dance weekend,"

19:39.720 --> 19:42.682
and people will say,

19:39.720 --> 19:42.682
"Did you win?"

19:42.723 --> 19:44.851
And then they'll say,

19:42.723 --> 19:44.851
"Well, what else do you do

19:42.723 --> 19:44.851
at these dance weekends?"

19:44.892 --> 19:46.686
Classes

19:44.892 --> 19:46.686
during the daytime,

19:46.727 --> 19:48.896
some performances

19:46.727 --> 19:48.896
of the teachers,

19:48.938 --> 19:51.774
a dance at night, and they're

19:48.938 --> 19:51.774
just a great opportunity

19:51.816 --> 19:55.277
to be exposed

19:51.816 --> 19:55.277
to a wider range of people

19:51.816 --> 19:55.277
to dance with.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.530
Basically, like,

19:55.319 --> 19:57.530
we get 1,800

19:57.571 --> 20:00.199
of our closest friends

19:57.571 --> 20:00.199
into a hotel room.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.035
We all dance

20:00.240 --> 20:02.035
with each other

20:00.240 --> 20:02.035
for the weekend,

20:02.076 --> 20:04.370
and a couple people

20:02.076 --> 20:04.370
win a couple

20:02.076 --> 20:04.370
of, you know,

20:04.411 --> 20:06.914
ribbons or trophies

20:04.411 --> 20:06.914
or something like that,

20:06.956 --> 20:09.709
but most of it

20:06.956 --> 20:09.709
is just socializing

20:06.956 --> 20:09.709
on the dance floor.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.633
The stakes

20:14.505 --> 20:17.633
in competition have

20:14.505 --> 20:17.633
to do for your soul.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.594
If you can kill it

20:17.675 --> 20:20.594
on the dance floor,

20:20.636 --> 20:23.890
your soul will remain

20:20.636 --> 20:23.890
for eternity.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.600
If you lose

20:23.931 --> 20:26.600
on the dance floor,

20:26.642 --> 20:28.978
you've lost in life

20:26.642 --> 20:28.978
and are considered

20:26.642 --> 20:28.978
a failure.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.104
[ding]

20:32.940 --> 20:35.317
And now it's time

20:32.940 --> 20:35.317
to bring out our finalists,

20:35.359 --> 20:39.405
so welcome now

20:35.359 --> 20:39.405
Steven and Chandrae!

20:39.446 --> 20:40.948
[cheering]

21:48.266 --> 21:49.516
[no audible dialogue]

22:31.058 --> 22:32.935
Well, after we went out

22:31.058 --> 22:32.935
our second time through,

22:32.977 --> 22:34.687
I was like,

22:32.977 --> 22:34.687
"We just won it." Yeah.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.354
He turned to me

22:34.728 --> 22:36.354
and said that...

22:36.396 --> 22:38.440
Yeah, "We just won."

22:36.396 --> 22:38.440
And I was like, "Nuh-uh!"

22:38.482 --> 22:41.359
One of the judges

22:38.482 --> 22:41.359
looked at me when we

22:38.482 --> 22:41.359
got in the line,

22:41.401 --> 22:42.028
and she was just like...

22:43.779 --> 22:45.739
[no audible dialogue]

22:45.781 --> 22:47.867
We got a lot

22:45.781 --> 22:47.867
of great compliments

22:47.908 --> 22:50.119
from friends

22:47.908 --> 22:50.119
and heroes

22:50.161 --> 22:51.204
and some that

22:50.161 --> 22:51.204
we really respect.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.126
It was amazing.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.252
Yeah.

22:58.294 --> 22:58.961
[both laugh]

23:08.304 --> 23:11.389
We decided

23:08.304 --> 23:11.389
to quit our jobs here

23:08.304 --> 23:11.389
pretty soon

23:11.431 --> 23:13.934
and just pursue

23:11.431 --> 23:13.934
dancing for--

23:13.976 --> 23:16.312
Full time with each other

23:16.354 --> 23:20.983
and just try to teach

23:16.354 --> 23:20.983
weekly classes

23:16.354 --> 23:20.983
to stay afloat.

23:21.025 --> 23:23.443
And then hopefully

23:21.025 --> 23:23.443
the more that we compete,

23:23.485 --> 23:25.988
the more that we

23:23.485 --> 23:25.988
get ourselves out there,

23:26.030 --> 23:27.240
then the more business

23:26.030 --> 23:27.240
will come back.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.836
Zoe, come here.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.836
Yeah!

23:40.878 --> 23:42.504
I actually

23:40.878 --> 23:42.504
started swing dancing...

23:44.840 --> 23:46.008
after my first tour in Iraq.

23:49.387 --> 23:52.639
I joined the Marine Corps

23:49.387 --> 23:52.639
in 2001.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.516
When I came back,

23:54.558 --> 23:58.104
I felt like

23:54.558 --> 23:58.104
I couldn't relate

23:58.145 --> 24:01.107
to people

23:58.145 --> 24:01.107
in my own country anymore,

24:01.148 --> 24:05.361
and I felt alienated

24:01.148 --> 24:05.361
and isolated.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.614
I just thought

24:05.403 --> 24:08.614
about, like, all the guys

24:05.403 --> 24:08.614
that didn't make it back.

24:08.655 --> 24:09.865
Like, I came back, and I

24:08.655 --> 24:09.865
just wanted to kill myself.

24:12.826 --> 24:16.789
And the dancing was

24:12.826 --> 24:16.789
a huge outlet for me.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.833
To see people doing

24:16.830 --> 24:19.833
all the crazy footwork

24:19.875 --> 24:22.502
and the aerials,

24:19.875 --> 24:22.502
doing the splits.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.131
They were dancing

24:22.544 --> 24:25.131
to this old-time music

24:25.172 --> 24:27.800
and dressed up

24:25.172 --> 24:27.800
in vintage clothes.

24:27.841 --> 24:31.345
That just blew me away,

24:27.841 --> 24:31.345
and I thought to myself,

24:31.387 --> 24:34.307
"If it takes me

24:31.387 --> 24:34.307
the rest of my life,

24:34.348 --> 24:37.726
I am going to learn

24:34.348 --> 24:37.726
how to do that,"

24:37.768 --> 24:38.352
and it gave me

24:37.768 --> 24:38.352
a reason to live.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.984
One of the most amazing

24:42.564 --> 24:44.984
experiences I've had

24:45.025 --> 24:47.320
was Camp Hollywood

24:45.025 --> 24:47.320
this last year.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.032
We ended up

24:49.529 --> 24:52.032
switching partners,

24:52.074 --> 24:56.870
and then I got Mo,

24:52.074 --> 24:56.870
one of my favorite dancers

24:52.074 --> 24:56.870
in the world.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.832
And I remember

24:56.912 --> 24:59.832
standing there

24:56.912 --> 24:59.832
right next to Mo

24:59.873 --> 25:01.708
with the band

24:59.873 --> 25:01.708
starting to play,

25:01.750 --> 25:04.878
thinking, "Wow,

25:01.750 --> 25:04.878
this is why I made it,

25:04.920 --> 25:06.588
for moments like this."

25:10.968 --> 25:14.180
Everybody's--

25:10.968 --> 25:14.180
Everybody's gone through

25:10.968 --> 25:14.180
their dark times.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.765
Everyone's always

25:14.221 --> 25:16.765
been in a position

25:16.807 --> 25:19.185
where they're really

25:16.807 --> 25:19.185
finding a reason to go on,

25:19.226 --> 25:21.270
and for me,

25:19.226 --> 25:21.270
for me at that moment,

25:21.312 --> 25:23.521
it was--it was the dance.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.232
It was Lindy Hop.

25:38.078 --> 25:41.123
RUSTY:

25:38.078 --> 25:41.123
In 1983, four places

25:41.165 --> 25:44.293
discovered Lindy Hop

25:41.165 --> 25:44.293
in a big way.

25:44.335 --> 25:45.961
So you got

25:44.335 --> 25:45.961
Los Angeles, New York,

25:46.003 --> 25:48.881
London, and Sweden.

25:48.922 --> 25:51.050
That's when

25:48.922 --> 25:51.050
the movie studios

25:51.091 --> 25:53.802
started issuing out

25:51.091 --> 25:53.802
their old movies

25:51.091 --> 25:53.802
on VHS tape.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.932
People got ahold

25:56.138 --> 25:58.932
of the movies,

25:58.974 --> 26:02.436
and they could watch them

25:58.974 --> 26:02.436
over and over and over again.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.063
And then they said,

26:02.478 --> 26:04.063
"Well, who are these people?"

26:04.104 --> 26:07.066
I was getting ready

26:04.104 --> 26:07.066
to retire, and I--

26:07.107 --> 26:09.902
I had gotten

26:07.107 --> 26:09.902
this phone call

26:07.107 --> 26:09.902
from Erin Stevens.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.405
[laughing]

26:09.943 --> 26:12.405
She came on the phone

26:09.943 --> 26:12.405
and said,

26:12.446 --> 26:15.491
"Well, are you

26:12.446 --> 26:15.491
Frankie Manning,

26:12.446 --> 26:15.491
the dancer?"

26:15.533 --> 26:17.117
And I said, "No,

26:15.533 --> 26:17.117
I'm Frankie Manning,

26:15.533 --> 26:17.117
the postal worker."

26:17.159 --> 26:17.951
[laughs]

26:21.830 --> 26:25.792
I always say a lot of other

26:21.830 --> 26:25.792
teachers taught me steps,

26:25.834 --> 26:27.753
but Frankie Manning

26:25.834 --> 26:27.753
taught me the heart

26:25.834 --> 26:27.753
and the soul of the dance.

26:30.506 --> 26:33.133
The Swedes asked

26:30.506 --> 26:33.133
who would come.

26:33.175 --> 26:36.095
They asked me first,

26:33.175 --> 26:36.095
but when I saw them dance,

26:36.136 --> 26:38.972
I couldn't deal with it.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.972
I said, "No way."

26:39.014 --> 26:41.267
But see, Frankie did, and--

26:41.308 --> 26:43.601
See, Frankie's kind.

26:43.643 --> 26:46.772
So I decided

26:43.643 --> 26:46.772
to go to New York again,

26:43.643 --> 26:46.772
meet Frankie,

26:46.813 --> 26:50.109
and then Frankie

26:46.813 --> 26:50.109
came to Sweden in '87.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.112
NORMA: I love dancers.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.112
I just hate beginners.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.655
Learn everything.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.655
Then when you come in

26:55.697 --> 26:58.117
and I tell you,

26:55.697 --> 26:58.117
"All right,

26:55.697 --> 26:58.117
give me eight bars,"

26:58.158 --> 26:59.452
at least you know

26:58.158 --> 26:59.452
what I'm talking about.

26:59.493 --> 27:02.288
Beep bop-di-bop,

26:59.493 --> 27:02.288
bop-bop, mm-bop

27:02.329 --> 27:04.290
I wouldn't teach

27:02.329 --> 27:04.290
a crippled crab

27:02.329 --> 27:04.290
how to use a crutch.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.501
[both laugh]

27:07.543 --> 27:11.464
So the swing dance scene

27:07.543 --> 27:11.464
was already growing,

27:11.505 --> 27:14.216
and then suddenly there was

27:11.505 --> 27:14.216
the perfect trifecta.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.552
In the mid-'90s, you had

27:14.258 --> 27:16.552
the movie "Swing Kids"...

27:16.594 --> 27:18.971
Yeah.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.223
[swing music playing]

27:21.265 --> 27:22.224
"Swingers"...

27:26.686 --> 27:28.855
and then

27:26.686 --> 27:28.855
the Gap commercial...

27:28.897 --> 27:31.233
Then you wail,

27:28.897 --> 27:31.233
you gotta jump, jive, and

27:31.275 --> 27:33.651
Then you wail,

27:31.275 --> 27:33.651
you gotta jump, jive, and

27:33.693 --> 27:35.321
...and that just blew

27:33.693 --> 27:35.321
swing dancing sky-high.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.576
Swing dance camps

27:38.532 --> 27:40.576
started kind of

27:40.618 --> 27:42.411
springing up

27:40.618 --> 27:42.411
around the globe.

27:42.453 --> 27:45.080
And then dancers

27:42.453 --> 27:45.080
at those camps

27:42.453 --> 27:45.080
would say,

27:45.122 --> 27:48.334
"Hey, let's hire

27:45.122 --> 27:48.334
Frankie and bring him

27:45.122 --> 27:48.334
to our community."

27:48.375 --> 27:50.668
I asked him, "Frankie,

27:48.375 --> 27:50.668
how many weekends

27:50.710 --> 27:52.921
"do you travel

27:50.710 --> 27:52.921
away from New York

27:52.963 --> 27:54.507
teaching somewhere else?"

27:54.548 --> 27:56.091
And he said,

27:54.548 --> 27:56.091
"I think this year,

27:56.133 --> 27:59.011
I do 42 weekends."

27:59.052 --> 28:03.765
This was a man,

27:59.052 --> 28:03.765
at the time, 85 years old.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.559
I like meeting

28:03.807 --> 28:05.559
different people from

28:03.807 --> 28:05.559
different countries,

28:05.601 --> 28:07.353
and a lot of times,

28:07.394 --> 28:09.855
they don't

28:07.394 --> 28:09.855
understand me,

28:09.896 --> 28:11.857
I don't understand them

28:09.896 --> 28:11.857
as far as speaking

28:09.896 --> 28:11.857
is concerned,

28:11.898 --> 28:13.691
but they can understand

28:11.898 --> 28:13.691
when my feet move.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.362
They say, "Oh, that?

28:13.733 --> 28:16.362
Yeah, I can do that."

28:16.403 --> 28:18.864
You know, "I could..."

28:18.905 --> 28:22.075
The minute

28:18.905 --> 28:22.075
he starts dancing,

28:18.905 --> 28:22.075
everyone gets it.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.244
Suddenly it's

28:22.117 --> 28:24.244
like the magic pill,

28:22.117 --> 28:24.244
you know?

28:24.286 --> 28:26.372
"Oh, I see I've

28:24.286 --> 28:26.372
been doing it wrong

28:26.413 --> 28:28.081
all this time,"

28:26.413 --> 28:28.081
you know?

28:28.123 --> 28:30.708
Now you have

28:28.123 --> 28:30.708
swing dancing in places

28:30.750 --> 28:33.045
that it never

28:30.750 --> 28:33.045
would have been before,

28:33.086 --> 28:34.712
in Scandinavia,

28:33.086 --> 28:34.712
Western Europe,

28:34.754 --> 28:37.132
Australia,

28:34.754 --> 28:37.132
New Zealand, and Asia.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.758
As a matter of fact,

28:37.174 --> 28:38.758
right now,

28:38.800 --> 28:40.260
one of the biggest

28:38.800 --> 28:40.260
Lindy Hop communities

28:40.302 --> 28:44.056
in the world

28:40.302 --> 28:44.056
is South Korea.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.932
It's not

28:44.097 --> 28:45.932
a Lindy Hop competition

28:45.974 --> 28:47.434
unless you get your ass

28:45.974 --> 28:47.434
kicked by a Korean.

28:47.476 --> 28:51.313
[laughs]

28:51.355 --> 28:52.565
'Cause I would

28:51.355 --> 28:52.565
like to see everybody

28:51.355 --> 28:52.565
in the world Lindy Hoppin'.

29:04.868 --> 29:08.288
I started swing dancing

29:04.868 --> 29:08.288
the year after I

29:04.868 --> 29:08.288
finished high school.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.123
Emelie didn't have

29:08.330 --> 29:10.123
a dance partner,

29:10.165 --> 29:12.292
so she convinced me

29:10.165 --> 29:12.292
to start dancing.

29:12.334 --> 29:13.919
I was totally skeptical

29:12.334 --> 29:13.919
at first.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.754
I was like, "No--"

29:15.795 --> 29:18.090
I had to force her.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.090
Yeah.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.133
I was like,

29:18.131 --> 29:20.133
"I can't even

29:18.131 --> 29:20.133
do aerobics."

29:23.470 --> 29:28.267
We both tried

29:23.470 --> 29:28.267
to have normal jobs

29:23.470 --> 29:28.267
as psychologists.

29:28.308 --> 29:32.104
You wake up

29:28.308 --> 29:32.104
in the morning,

29:28.308 --> 29:32.104
and you're happy,

29:32.145 --> 29:34.856
and you go to work,

29:32.145 --> 29:34.856
and during the day,

29:34.898 --> 29:37.610
you talk to people

29:34.898 --> 29:37.610
who tell you

29:37.651 --> 29:39.986
that life sucks

29:37.651 --> 29:39.986
and life is not

29:37.651 --> 29:39.986
worth living

29:40.028 --> 29:41.280
for eight hours,

29:41.321 --> 29:43.365
and then

29:41.321 --> 29:43.365
after eight hours,

29:43.407 --> 29:45.117
you--you kind of

29:43.407 --> 29:45.117
believe it, too.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.953
So the--the last client,

29:47.994 --> 29:49.622
then you're like,

29:47.994 --> 29:49.622
"Yeah, you're right."

29:52.082 --> 29:55.669
Psychotherapy was

29:52.082 --> 29:55.669
the worst way

29:55.711 --> 29:57.463
to make people happy,

29:57.504 --> 29:59.839
and to teach Lindy Hop

29:59.881 --> 30:02.217
and to dance

29:59.881 --> 30:02.217
with people is

30:02.259 --> 30:04.720
a way better way

30:02.259 --> 30:04.720
to make people happy

30:04.762 --> 30:06.555
and to make the world

30:04.762 --> 30:06.555
a better place.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.682
[speaking Swedish]

30:08.724 --> 30:10.643
[rock-'n'-roll playing]

30:14.563 --> 30:17.650
We thought that we

30:14.563 --> 30:17.650
would be able to combine

30:17.691 --> 30:19.735
the two works

30:17.691 --> 30:19.735
to work, like, 200%.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.320
Yeah.

30:21.361 --> 30:24.823
Uh, but that

30:21.361 --> 30:24.823
was impossible.

30:24.864 --> 30:30.036
We said yes

30:24.864 --> 30:30.036
to go and teach, uh,

30:24.864 --> 30:30.036
in a lot of places,

30:30.078 --> 30:33.206
and then we canceled,

30:30.078 --> 30:33.206
and that's a very...

30:33.248 --> 30:35.083
Bad thing to do

30:33.248 --> 30:35.083
dumb thing to do,

30:35.125 --> 30:37.002
because then they

30:35.125 --> 30:37.002
won't ask you again.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.507
If you're away

30:39.379 --> 30:41.507
from the scene

30:41.548 --> 30:44.092
for, like, half a year

30:41.548 --> 30:44.092
or a year...

30:44.134 --> 30:44.884
Like,

30:44.134 --> 30:44.884
they forget about you.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.896
Arch your back.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.525
No.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.777
REBECKA:

30:59.566 --> 31:01.777
So we've been coming

30:59.566 --> 31:01.777
on tourist visas.

31:01.819 --> 31:04.363
It's kind of hard

31:01.819 --> 31:04.363
to get through the customs,

31:04.404 --> 31:06.865
'cause they, like, wonder

31:04.404 --> 31:06.865
how we can go on vacation,

31:06.906 --> 31:09.368
like, all the time.

31:06.906 --> 31:09.368
Yeah.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.911
Uh, so we

31:09.409 --> 31:11.911
have to, like, make up

31:09.409 --> 31:11.911
these stories, you know?

31:11.953 --> 31:13.288
SUSAN: What are

31:11.953 --> 31:13.288
some of the stories

31:11.953 --> 31:13.288
you've made up?

31:13.330 --> 31:14.707
That we are

31:13.330 --> 31:14.707
really rich.

31:14.748 --> 31:15.874
Yeah. [laughs]

31:15.915 --> 31:18.377
Really rich parents.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.713
Do you have

31:18.418 --> 31:20.713
other siblings?

31:20.754 --> 31:24.466
Yeah. We're actually

31:20.754 --> 31:24.466
not biological,

31:20.754 --> 31:24.466
uh, sisters.

31:24.508 --> 31:25.300
[record needle scratches]

31:24.508 --> 31:25.300
That's a long story.

31:25.342 --> 31:26.051
[both laugh]

31:29.429 --> 31:32.725
We met each other

31:29.429 --> 31:32.725
very, very long

31:29.429 --> 31:32.725
time ago.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.310
We became

31:32.766 --> 31:35.310
very close friends,

31:35.352 --> 31:40.106
and then we decided

31:35.352 --> 31:40.106
to become sisters,

31:35.352 --> 31:40.106
to adopt each other.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.818
And are you a couple?

31:40.148 --> 31:42.818
Or are you just

31:40.148 --> 31:42.818
best friends?

31:42.860 --> 31:43.819
No, we're sisters.

31:43.861 --> 31:45.237
We're sisters.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.113
We adopted

31:45.278 --> 31:47.113
each other.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.115
And you changed

31:47.155 --> 31:49.115
your name legally?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.325
Yeah.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.325
Yeah.

31:50.367 --> 31:51.744
It's in

31:50.367 --> 31:51.744
our passports.

31:51.785 --> 31:53.412
Whose name did you take?

31:53.453 --> 31:55.247
We took a new name.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.247
We made it up.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.457
You made it up?

31:55.288 --> 31:57.457
Yes.

31:57.499 --> 31:59.668
We are the only

31:57.499 --> 31:59.668
in the whole world

31:57.499 --> 31:59.668
with that name.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.922
My guy is at home,

32:03.963 --> 32:05.298
and I'm away

32:03.963 --> 32:05.298

32:13.390 --> 32:15.517
Um...

32:15.559 --> 32:17.269
He must be the last.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.521
Okay, the hierarchy.

32:19.563 --> 32:22.441
Uh, okay, I hope

32:19.563 --> 32:22.441
he never sees this.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.777
[laughs]

32:22.482 --> 32:24.777
But--

32:24.818 --> 32:27.153
Ohh.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.988
I would always--

32:27.195 --> 32:28.988
I mean,

32:29.030 --> 32:32.618
I would always

32:29.030 --> 32:32.618
choose dancing and--

32:32.659 --> 32:36.288
and our partnership,

32:32.659 --> 32:36.288
I think, before him,

32:32.659 --> 32:36.288
yes.

[swing music playing]

32:47.006 --> 32:49.551
Here's a little

32:47.006 --> 32:49.551
Benny Goodman for all

32:47.006 --> 32:49.551

32:49.593 --> 32:51.970
It's called

32:49.593 --> 32:51.970
"All the Cats Join In."

33:01.354 --> 33:03.148
Nobody does

33:01.354 --> 33:03.148

33:01.354 --> 33:03.148
than Lindy Hop.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.823
There's a leader,

33:08.862 --> 33:10.823
and there's a follower.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.658
The leader always

33:10.864 --> 33:12.658
has to be thinking ahead,

33:12.699 --> 33:14.159
planning what

33:12.699 --> 33:14.159
they're gonna do next,

33:14.200 --> 33:16.829
how they're gonna

33:14.200 --> 33:16.829
move the partner.

33:16.870 --> 33:20.165
The follower is responding

33:16.870 --> 33:20.165
to what the guy's doing

33:20.206 --> 33:22.668
and have

33:20.206 --> 33:22.668
this great conversation.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.003
It's a little hard

33:22.709 --> 33:25.003
to learn.

33:25.044 --> 33:27.881
It's like a lot

33:25.044 --> 33:27.881
of good things in life.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.843
Maybe you maybe have

33:27.923 --> 33:30.843
to put in a little work

33:30.884 --> 33:32.177
to get to a place

33:30.884 --> 33:32.177

33:30.884 --> 33:32.177

33:36.222 --> 33:40.185
there's no choreography.

33:40.226 --> 33:42.103
You are dancing

33:40.226 --> 33:42.103
to the music that

33:40.226 --> 33:42.103
the band is creating.

33:46.316 --> 33:48.193
AUGIE:

33:46.316 --> 33:48.193
You have to improvise.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.612
You have to negotiate,

33:48.234 --> 33:50.612
kind of like jazz music,

33:50.654 --> 33:53.866
this ability

33:50.654 --> 33:53.866
to call and respond,

33:53.907 --> 33:57.786
to read your partner

33:53.907 --> 33:57.786
and see what happens.

33:57.828 --> 34:00.288
ANDREA: You're sharing

33:57.828 --> 34:00.288
your imagination

33:57.828 --> 34:00.288
with someone else,

34:00.330 --> 34:03.583
and that's

34:00.330 --> 34:03.583
real intimacy.

34:03.625 --> 34:06.044
And that moment

34:03.625 --> 34:06.044
can never be recreated.

34:06.085 --> 34:08.463
That's what

34:06.085 --> 34:08.463
makes it special.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.591
Unlike some dances

34:08.505 --> 34:11.591
I've observed

34:11.632 --> 34:14.092
that are partner dances,

34:11.632 --> 34:14.092
but they're very much,

34:14.135 --> 34:17.639
"I'm on a date

34:14.135 --> 34:17.639
with my girlfriend.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.639
Don't ask her to dance,"

34:17.681 --> 34:19.975
Lindy Hop, it's understood

34:17.681 --> 34:19.975
that everyone dances

34:17.681 --> 34:19.975
with everybody,

34:20.016 --> 34:22.811
and the more, the merrier.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.811
I mean, I think really,

34:22.853 --> 34:24.980
if there were a movie

34:22.853 --> 34:24.980
called "Lindy Hop,"

34:25.022 --> 34:25.898
the tagline should be

34:25.022 --> 34:25.898
"The more, the merrier."

34:28.942 --> 34:31.069
When I came back from

34:28.942 --> 34:31.069
your dance on Saturday

34:31.110 --> 34:33.405
and I--You know,

34:31.110 --> 34:33.405
I got home at, like,

34:31.110 --> 34:33.405
2:00 in the morning,

34:33.446 --> 34:35.908
and my wife was in bed,

34:33.446 --> 34:35.908
and she woke up,

34:35.949 --> 34:38.076
and the first thing

34:35.949 --> 34:38.076
she said to me was,

34:38.117 --> 34:39.661
"Did you dance

34:38.117 --> 34:39.661
with everybody?"

34:39.703 --> 34:41.746
And I said,

34:39.703 --> 34:41.746
"Yes, I did."

34:41.788 --> 34:42.748
[laughs]

34:41.788 --> 34:42.748
Wow.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.668
ANDREA: There's

34:46.292 --> 34:47.668
an incredible intimacy

34:47.710 --> 34:50.255
that forms

34:47.710 --> 34:50.255
amongst strangers.

34:50.295 --> 34:51.505
You meet someone

34:50.295 --> 34:51.505
for the first time,

34:51.547 --> 34:53.466
and by the end

34:51.547 --> 34:53.466
of the song,

34:53.507 --> 34:54.967
you feel like they're

34:53.507 --> 34:54.967
finishing you sentences.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.511
If I had that kind

34:55.010 --> 34:56.511
of connection

34:56.553 --> 34:58.638
with someone I met

34:56.553 --> 34:58.638
in a grocery store,

34:58.680 --> 35:01.016
I'd ask him

34:58.680 --> 35:01.016
for his number,

34:58.680 --> 35:01.016
but it's not like that.

35:01.058 --> 35:05.353
In a swing dance,

35:01.058 --> 35:05.353
you just move on and

35:01.058 --> 35:05.353
find the next person.

35:05.395 --> 35:06.813
Frankie always

35:05.395 --> 35:06.813

35:06.855 --> 35:09.315
like, three-minute

35:06.855 --> 35:09.315

35:09.357 --> 35:11.150
You're just gonna be

35:11.192 --> 35:12.277
you're dancing with

35:11.192 --> 35:12.277
for three minutes,

35:12.318 --> 35:14.362
and it's

35:12.318 --> 35:14.362
gonna be amazing,

35:14.404 --> 35:16.448
and then you do it

35:14.404 --> 35:16.448
again and again

35:14.404 --> 35:16.448
all night long.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.666
It's an addiction

35:24.831 --> 35:26.666
that's better,

35:26.708 --> 35:30.045
more fulfilling,

35:26.708 --> 35:30.045
and healthier

35:26.708 --> 35:30.045
than crack,

35:30.087 --> 35:32.213
but probably

35:30.087 --> 35:32.213
about as addictive.

we sleep anywhere.

36:34.651 --> 36:40.032
a lot of death,

36:43.618 --> 36:45.745

to bring that art back

36:53.086 --> 36:55.047

36:53.086 --> 36:55.047

When I

37:21.948 --> 37:24.076
was coming here,

37:21.948 --> 37:24.076
I was a bit afraid,

37:24.117 --> 37:26.119
because I

37:24.117 --> 37:26.119
started building up

37:24.117 --> 37:26.119

37:26.161 --> 37:27.829
it will be, and,

that I would

be disappointed.

I came here,

37:32.167 --> 37:33.668
there were

your sweetheart.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.018

39:17.396 --> 39:19.691
or something like that.

39:19.732 --> 39:22.610
This was never

39:19.732 --> 39:22.610
a ballroom dance.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.696
It's funny.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.696
I mean, I--

39:24.737 --> 39:28.033
Again, I don't wanna,

39:24.737 --> 39:28.033
you know, insult anybody,

39:28.074 --> 39:30.451
but I'm one

39:28.074 --> 39:30.451
of those people that thinks

39:28.074 --> 39:30.451
blues is kind of icky.

39:30.493 --> 39:31.452
[laughs]

39:33.454 --> 39:35.707
EVITA: Lots of people

39:33.454 --> 39:35.707
are afraid of it

39:35.748 --> 39:37.250
because of

39:35.748 --> 39:37.250
how intimate it can be.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.754
There's a stillness

39:41.796 --> 39:44.049
while you're pressed up

39:41.796 --> 39:44.049
against somebody else,

39:44.090 --> 39:47.385
and I think it

39:44.090 --> 39:47.385
forces you to be present

39:44.090 --> 39:47.385
in that moment.

39:49.262 --> 39:51.639
Uh...

39:51.681 --> 39:54.267
blues dancing,

39:51.681 --> 39:54.267
I think, um, it--

39:54.309 --> 39:56.269
it walks a fine line.

39:56.311 --> 39:57.395
Um, I personally

39:56.311 --> 39:57.395
enjoy it.

40:03.026 --> 40:05.320
It's become part

40:03.026 --> 40:05.320
of something that you learn

40:03.026 --> 40:05.320
when you're a swing dancer,

40:05.362 --> 40:06.946
and perhaps you perform it.

40:05.362 --> 40:06.946
Perhaps you compete

40:06.988 --> 40:07.947
in competitions

40:06.988 --> 40:07.947
like we do with it.

40:13.286 --> 40:17.456
Lots of moments

40:13.286 --> 40:17.456
I love in blues dancing

40:13.286 --> 40:17.456
where you suspend upwards

40:17.498 --> 40:19.667
or you linger longer

40:17.498 --> 40:19.667
before taking that step...

40:22.212 --> 40:26.091
or you melt into a dip,

40:26.132 --> 40:30.428
and you sort of just drip

40:26.132 --> 40:30.428
all over each other.

40:30.469 --> 40:32.764
You know how

40:30.469 --> 40:32.764
they always say

40:32.805 --> 40:34.599
"You don't know

40:32.805 --> 40:34.599
how you would respond

40:34.640 --> 40:38.353
in the moment

40:34.640 --> 40:38.353
of whatever."

40:38.395 --> 40:40.105
It's really true of--

40:38.395 --> 40:40.105
of dancing sometimes.

40:42.648 --> 40:47.112
Every time

40:42.648 --> 40:47.112
I close my eyes

40:47.153 --> 40:52.450
I seem to seek

40:47.153 --> 40:52.450
Louisiana

40:52.491 --> 40:56.037
All those folks

40:52.491 --> 40:56.037
down there

40:56.079 --> 40:58.957
Singing in their

40:56.079 --> 40:58.957
free and easy manner...

41:02.668 --> 41:07.632
Yeah, she's so much more

41:02.668 --> 41:07.632
powerful and controlled

41:07.673 --> 41:10.551
and put together

41:07.673 --> 41:10.551
than the way I feel.

41:14.347 --> 41:17.309
I don't have

41:14.347 --> 41:17.309
the perfect shape or frame.

41:17.350 --> 41:18.977
It doesn't look

41:17.350 --> 41:18.977
like the magazine.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.728
It doesn't look like

41:19.018 --> 41:20.728
the movie stars.

41:20.770 --> 41:24.149
You know, it doesn't look

41:20.770 --> 41:24.149
like a ballet dancer.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.025
And yet, it is exactly

41:24.190 --> 41:26.025
what it's supposed to be.

41:31.614 --> 41:37.578
It's really scary

41:31.614 --> 41:37.578
to move in a sensual way.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.832
It requires a confidence

41:37.620 --> 41:40.832
or a permission,

41:40.873 --> 41:43.501
and the thing is

41:40.873 --> 41:43.501
everybody has it in them.

41:43.542 --> 41:45.837
We all are capable of this,

41:45.878 --> 41:48.714
but we're just

41:45.878 --> 41:48.714
so petrified to--to be that.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.675
...steady homing

41:50.716 --> 41:53.886
I'm Delta bound

41:53.928 --> 41:57.015
When I teach blues, I just

41:53.928 --> 41:57.015
try to spend most of my time

41:57.056 --> 41:59.351
talking about

41:57.056 --> 41:59.351
the psychology,

41:59.392 --> 42:02.520
more so than, "Hey,

41:59.392 --> 42:02.520
everybody, do this step."

42:02.561 --> 42:05.564
And maybe that's what people

42:02.561 --> 42:05.564
need every now and then.

42:05.606 --> 42:08.693
They just need permission

42:05.606 --> 42:08.693
from somebody else

42:08.734 --> 42:10.069
to do what they want to do.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.880
Well, when I started

42:26.627 --> 42:28.880
in the '90s,

42:28.921 --> 42:32.050
it was a lot of,

42:28.921 --> 42:32.050
um, ex-punk rockers,

42:32.091 --> 42:36.054
but it's mostly

42:32.091 --> 42:36.054
now young people,

42:36.095 --> 42:39.391
very religious people,

42:36.095 --> 42:39.391
and/or Asian engineers.

42:39.432 --> 42:41.976
[laughs]

42:42.018 --> 42:44.603
It's an odd combo,

42:42.018 --> 42:44.603
but somehow it works.

42:44.645 --> 42:47.565
There's one group that's

42:44.645 --> 42:47.565
missing in numbers.

42:47.606 --> 42:50.068
They're there,

42:47.606 --> 42:50.068
but they're missing

42:50.109 --> 42:51.569
in the numbers

42:50.109 --> 42:51.569
in which they

42:50.109 --> 42:51.569
should be representive,

42:51.610 --> 42:53.405
and that's

42:51.610 --> 42:53.405
African-American

42:51.610 --> 42:53.405
dancers.

42:53.446 --> 42:56.282
This is one of the funniest

42:53.446 --> 42:56.282
and strangest oxymorons.

42:56.324 --> 42:58.117
The dance

42:56.324 --> 42:58.117
started in Harlem.

42:59.785 --> 43:01.996
It went all over the world,

42:59.785 --> 43:01.996
which is great,

43:02.038 --> 43:06.418
but there's somehow

43:02.038 --> 43:06.418
a disconnect happened.

43:06.459 --> 43:08.753
Sometimes you hear

43:06.459 --> 43:08.753
within the black community,

43:08.794 --> 43:11.297
"Oh, we create things,

43:08.794 --> 43:11.297
and then we move on,

43:08.794 --> 43:11.297
we move on, we move on."

43:11.339 --> 43:13.091
We went to the place.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.009
It was full

43:13.132 --> 43:15.009
of black people,

43:15.051 --> 43:18.096
and they were

43:15.051 --> 43:18.096
doing their thing,

43:18.137 --> 43:20.265
and so we went over

43:18.137 --> 43:20.265
in the corner and

43:18.137 --> 43:20.265
started dancing.

43:20.306 --> 43:21.974
There was only

43:20.306 --> 43:21.974
about 10 of us,

43:22.016 --> 43:24.685
and all the black people

43:22.016 --> 43:24.685
come over and say,

43:24.727 --> 43:27.272
"Hey, whoa, whoa,

43:24.727 --> 43:27.272
whoa. Wait a minute.

43:24.727 --> 43:27.272
What are you all doing?"

43:27.313 --> 43:28.814
And I said, "Now,

43:27.313 --> 43:28.814
that's pretty funny.

43:28.856 --> 43:31.109
"This is your dance,

43:31.150 --> 43:33.278
and you

43:31.150 --> 43:33.278
come over and ask me

43:31.150 --> 43:33.278
what are we doing."

43:35.654 --> 43:37.532
When we talk

43:35.654 --> 43:37.532
to the children

43:37.574 --> 43:39.284
and we ask them, "Where

43:37.574 --> 43:39.284
did this dance start?"

43:39.325 --> 43:41.160
they say Europe.

43:41.202 --> 43:42.036
They say almost anything

43:41.202 --> 43:42.036
except Harlem.

43:45.664 --> 43:48.334
So I show them

43:45.664 --> 43:48.334
the old clips, and they're

43:45.664 --> 43:48.334
in black and white.

43:48.376 --> 43:51.129
Then I say,

43:48.376 --> 43:51.129
"Now I'm gonna show you

43:48.376 --> 43:51.129
some people doing it today,

43:51.170 --> 43:53.047
"so you're gonna see

43:51.170 --> 43:53.047
some color clips,

43:53.089 --> 43:55.300
but I want you to tell me

43:53.089 --> 43:55.300
what color you don't see."

43:55.341 --> 43:56.968
They say,

43:55.341 --> 43:56.968
"I don't see brown.

43:57.009 --> 43:58.344
I don't see myself."

43:58.386 --> 44:00.221
And it's sad.

44:00.263 --> 44:02.014
I feel like black people

44:00.263 --> 44:02.014
are not given

44:02.056 --> 44:04.517
a whole lot of things

44:02.056 --> 44:04.517
that are part

44:04.559 --> 44:06.811
of their, like,

44:04.559 --> 44:06.811
culture or heritage

44:04.559 --> 44:06.811
to be proud of,

44:06.852 --> 44:09.147
and I think it's hard

44:06.852 --> 44:09.147
to grow up that way.

44:09.188 --> 44:10.356
It's hard to grow up and

44:09.188 --> 44:10.356
have that sense of self.

44:13.276 --> 44:17.822
But we are responsible

44:13.276 --> 44:17.822
for an art,

44:17.863 --> 44:19.991
and that's something

44:17.863 --> 44:19.991
that, like, I'm very

44:17.863 --> 44:19.991
proud to say is mine.

44:20.032 --> 44:22.243
You have got to include--

44:22.285 --> 44:26.372
Drag them in,

44:22.285 --> 44:26.372
shake 'em up,

44:26.414 --> 44:28.583
but get black kids involved

44:26.414 --> 44:28.583
in what you're doing!

44:31.710 --> 44:33.712
There are people

44:31.710 --> 44:33.712
out there who--

44:31.710 --> 44:33.712
who need this dance,

44:33.754 --> 44:36.382
and I think that

44:33.754 --> 44:36.382
the younger you get it,

44:36.424 --> 44:40.011
the more happy

44:36.424 --> 44:40.011
and adjusted

44:36.424 --> 44:40.011
you can probably be.

44:40.052 --> 44:44.098
ALLISON:

44:40.052 --> 44:44.098
Once they see those films,

44:40.052 --> 44:44.098
they really want to do it.

44:44.140 --> 44:46.351
And they realize

44:44.140 --> 44:46.351
they can't do this dance

44:44.140 --> 44:46.351
with pants on the ground.

44:46.392 --> 44:47.852
They pick up their pants,

44:46.392 --> 44:47.852
and they start doing it.

44:47.893 --> 44:49.395
[laughs]

44:52.398 --> 44:55.360
The music, the dance,

44:52.398 --> 44:55.360
the excitement gets them.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.693
It's probably

44:55.401 --> 44:56.693
in their bloodline.

44:56.735 --> 44:57.862
They don't even know it.

44:57.903 --> 44:58.863
[laughs]

45:11.792 --> 45:15.712
Me and Chanzie,

45:11.792 --> 45:15.712
we're going to D.C.,

45:15.754 --> 45:17.382
week and a half,

45:15.754 --> 45:17.382
for the International

45:15.754 --> 45:17.382
Lindy Hop Championship.

45:20.301 --> 45:21.927
Yeah.

45:21.969 --> 45:23.429
Thanks, man.

45:23.471 --> 45:25.722
I.L.H.C. is

45:23.471 --> 45:25.722
one of the biggest

45:25.764 --> 45:27.933
international events

45:25.764 --> 45:27.933
in the world.

45:27.975 --> 45:30.395
There's an energy there

45:27.975 --> 45:30.395
that's a little different.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.480
It's because there's

45:30.436 --> 45:32.480
so many foreigners.

45:32.522 --> 45:34.815
There's people

45:32.522 --> 45:34.815
from all over the world,

45:34.857 --> 45:36.733
and the best of the best

45:34.857 --> 45:36.733
come there.

45:36.775 --> 45:38.236
[swing music playing]

45:47.370 --> 45:48.496
Little bit.

45:48.538 --> 45:50.122
Always. Like, it's--

45:50.164 --> 45:51.832
More just excited,

45:50.164 --> 45:51.832
you know.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.585
More excited.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.585
Excited-nervous,

45:53.626 --> 45:55.587
but I think you

45:53.626 --> 45:55.587
have to have that.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.587
It's--

45:55.628 --> 45:56.753
Once the music starts,

45:55.628 --> 45:56.753
it's, uh--

45:56.795 --> 45:58.339
the nerves are gone.

45:58.381 --> 46:00.007
From the United States

45:58.381 --> 46:00.007
as well,

46:00.049 --> 46:02.759
Steven Sayer

46:00.049 --> 46:02.759
and Chandrae Roettig.

46:02.801 --> 46:06.097
This is

46:02.801 --> 46:06.097
way more competition

46:06.138 --> 46:08.600
than there was

46:06.138 --> 46:08.600
at Camp Hollywood this year.

46:08.641 --> 46:10.851
And after that,

46:08.641 --> 46:10.851
anything you want.

46:10.893 --> 46:11.768
My recommendation is...

46:16.649 --> 46:18.859
It's not home. You know,

46:18.901 --> 46:20.194
there's something

46:18.901 --> 46:20.194
comforting about home,

46:18.901 --> 46:20.194
and so--

46:20.236 --> 46:22.154
Don't have the home-field

46:20.236 --> 46:22.154
advantage anymore.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.197
We're in somebody else's

46:22.196 --> 46:23.197
ballpark right now.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.197
Yeah.

46:23.239 --> 46:24.699
[chanting]

46:23.239 --> 46:24.699
Baltimore!

46:24.741 --> 46:27.285
Baltimore!

46:24.741 --> 46:27.285
Baltimore!

46:27.326 --> 46:29.454
These Baltimore kids,

46:27.326 --> 46:29.454
man. Shit.

47:43.944 --> 47:46.364
We trained so hard.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.907
I felt like it was just

47:46.405 --> 47:48.907
gonna be like Camp Hollywood,

47:48.949 --> 47:50.368
like, we're just

47:48.949 --> 47:50.368
gonna blow these people

47:48.949 --> 47:50.368
out the water.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.753
And then we get down there,

47:58.167 --> 48:00.753

48:00.795 --> 48:02.714
"Oh, my God." It's like

48:00.795 --> 48:02.714
everybody's out there,

Well, Kevin and Jo

48:10.095 --> 48:12.724

48:10.095 --> 48:12.724
to work the crowd.

They--You know, they worked

48:12.765 --> 48:14.225

48:18.437 --> 48:19.814
Yeah, we definitely--

48:18.437 --> 48:19.814
we definitely didn't

48:18.437 --> 48:19.814

48:51.470 --> 48:54.265
where you can go dancing.

48:56.225 --> 48:57.769
It's kinda similar

48:57.810 --> 49:00.271
to where people

48:57.810 --> 49:00.271
would go to pray.

49:00.312 --> 49:02.648
You can pray

49:00.312 --> 49:02.648
in your bedroom,

49:02.690 --> 49:05.610
and you can pray

49:02.690 --> 49:05.610
on the subway,

49:05.651 --> 49:08.529

49:05.651 --> 49:08.529
like, a religious

49:05.651 --> 49:08.529

49:08.571 --> 49:11.866

49:08.571 --> 49:11.866
when you walk into

49:08.571 --> 49:11.866
a cathedral.

49:17.037 --> 49:21.125
The Avalon Ballroom

49:17.037 --> 49:21.125
on Catalina Island

49:21.166 --> 49:24.796

49:21.166 --> 49:24.796

49:36.557 --> 49:38.810
I met the caretaker,

49:38.851 --> 49:41.186
who's been there

49:38.851 --> 49:41.186
since the '30s

49:38.851 --> 49:41.186

He was

49:41.228 --> 49:42.814
an elderly gentleman,

49:42.855 --> 49:45.316
but he said to me,

49:42.855 --> 49:45.316
on the way out, he says,

49:45.357 --> 49:48.736
"The lady was happy

49:45.357 --> 49:48.736
with your show."

49:48.778 --> 49:51.322
And I kind of

49:48.778 --> 49:51.322
looked at him

49:48.778 --> 49:51.322
with a puzzlement,

49:51.363 --> 49:54.158
and I said, "Um, lady?"

49:54.199 --> 49:56.577
He says, "Yes,

49:54.199 --> 49:56.577
the ballroom, the lady.

49:56.619 --> 49:58.496
You know, and she's

50:50.088 --> 50:52.884
a small miracle. It's--

50:52.925 --> 50:54.552
Makes you feel

50:52.925 --> 50:54.552
a whole lot better

50:52.925 --> 50:54.552
than you are,

50:54.593 --> 50:55.553
'cause I know

50:54.593 --> 50:55.553
I'm not that good.

[slow jazz playing]

51:06.480 --> 51:10.108
Steve and I

51:06.480 --> 51:10.108
had to do three dances

51:06.480 --> 51:10.108
back to back.

51:10.150 --> 51:12.110
And, yeah,

51:10.150 --> 51:12.110
that sounds so romantic

51:10.150 --> 51:12.110
and dramatic,

51:12.152 --> 51:13.738
but it's sincerely

51:12.152 --> 51:13.738
what happens

51:13.779 --> 51:15.113
all the time

51:13.779 --> 51:15.113
in this dance.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.075
You'll find someone,

51:17.658 --> 51:19.075
and you'll--

51:19.117 --> 51:21.161
you'll just

51:19.117 --> 51:21.161
hit it off with them,

51:21.203 --> 51:23.121
and it doesn't mean

51:21.203 --> 51:23.121
you're gonna marry them,

51:23.163 --> 51:26.584
a sincere spark.

absolute pleasure.

It'll be amazing.

51:41.181 --> 51:43.809
EVITA: Physical contact

51:41.181 --> 51:43.809
and touch has got to be

51:43.851 --> 51:45.937
the most powerful gift

51:43.851 --> 51:45.937
that we could give

51:43.851 --> 51:45.937
to each other.

51:51.233 --> 51:56.030
I think people are

51:51.233 --> 51:56.030
afraid to physically

51:51.233 --> 51:56.030
contact each other,

51:56.072 --> 51:59.450
'cause maybe

51:56.072 --> 51:59.450
it's too intimate?

51:59.491 --> 52:02.036
And it's really easy

51:59.491 --> 52:02.036
to distance ourselves.

52:07.332 --> 52:10.669
As I grew up and

52:07.332 --> 52:10.669
graduated from

52:07.332 --> 52:10.669
high school and college,

52:10.711 --> 52:13.129
I went to work,

52:10.711 --> 52:13.129
I clocked in,

52:10.711 --> 52:13.129
I clocked out,

52:13.171 --> 52:16.132
and I didn't really

52:13.171 --> 52:16.132
have much of a life

52:13.171 --> 52:16.132
other than that.

52:16.174 --> 52:21.221
Emotionally, I just

52:16.174 --> 52:21.221
was sort of hidden

52:16.174 --> 52:21.221
and locked up,

52:21.263 --> 52:25.684

52:21.263 --> 52:25.684
for a person to live.

52:25.726 --> 52:27.311
caught up with

52:25.726 --> 52:27.311
other things.

52:27.352 --> 52:29.145
We get caught up

52:27.352 --> 52:29.145
with doing well

52:27.352 --> 52:29.145
in work

52:29.187 --> 52:30.648
or studying hard

52:29.187 --> 52:30.648
and all this.

52:30.689 --> 52:33.233
You know, you forget

52:30.689 --> 52:33.233
about freedom.

52:33.275 --> 52:33.859
You forget about

52:33.275 --> 52:33.859

sitting in an office

52:40.783 --> 52:43.243
at their computer,

52:43.285 --> 52:47.331
and they have

52:43.285 --> 52:47.331
to meet me at Swing 46

52:43.285 --> 52:47.331
on Tuesday night,

52:47.372 --> 52:50.918
because that is

52:47.372 --> 52:50.918
their physical outlet

52:47.372 --> 52:50.918
for being with people,

52:50.960 --> 52:53.337
and it's not

52:50.960 --> 52:53.337
just standing around

52:50.960 --> 52:53.337
at a bar, drinking.

52:53.378 --> 52:54.338
It's playing.

52:56.256 --> 52:58.592
You have to be on your feet

52:58.634 --> 53:01.053
and physically

52:58.634 --> 53:01.053
touching somebody else.

53:01.095 --> 53:03.764
ANDREA: Every dance

53:01.095 --> 53:03.764
feels like

53:01.095 --> 53:03.764
sharing a joke

53:03.806 --> 53:06.182
or having, like,

53:03.806 --> 53:06.182
a little secret

53:03.806 --> 53:06.182
conversation,

53:06.224 --> 53:08.184
and I think

53:06.224 --> 53:08.184
that connectiveness

53:06.224 --> 53:08.184
to another person

53:08.226 --> 53:11.396
is enough to, like,

53:08.226 --> 53:11.396
break the doldrums,

53:11.438 --> 53:13.357
you know, make you

53:11.438 --> 53:13.357
realize that things

53:11.438 --> 53:13.357
are okay.

53:16.819 --> 53:19.071
I--I look around,

53:16.819 --> 53:19.071
and there's like

53:16.819 --> 53:19.071
200 people,

53:19.113 --> 53:21.032
and there's not

53:19.113 --> 53:21.032
a cell phone out.

53:19.113 --> 53:21.032
It's amazing.

53:21.073 --> 53:23.784
So people get

53:21.073 --> 53:23.784
a respite from all

53:23.826 --> 53:26.244
of the negativity

53:23.826 --> 53:26.244

53:23.826 --> 53:26.244
puts on us.

ANDREA:

53:30.248 --> 53:32.417
I needed to hold

53:30.248 --> 53:32.417
people's hand,

53:32.459 --> 53:34.879
and I needed to,

53:32.459 --> 53:34.879
like, hug people,

53:34.920 --> 53:37.589
and I needed to,

53:34.920 --> 53:37.589
like, share a laugh,

53:37.631 --> 53:39.717
wasn't doing that

53:37.631 --> 53:39.717
before Lindy Hop.

53:39.758 --> 53:42.803
I think that it's

53:39.758 --> 53:42.803
made me more willing

53:42.845 --> 53:45.597
to get

53:42.845 --> 53:45.597
to know people

53:42.845 --> 53:45.597
and to open up.

53:45.639 --> 53:46.974
It's so nice.

Wouldn't you

rather have somebody

53:59.778 --> 54:01.446
say, "Dance with me,"

54:01.488 --> 54:02.238
instead of "Facebook me"?

Exactly!

of the most special things

about the Lindy Hop community

54:28.807 --> 54:31.977
is how revered

54:28.807 --> 54:31.977
the old-timers are,

54:28.807 --> 54:31.977
the original dancers.

54:32.019 --> 54:34.646
Because

54:32.019 --> 54:34.646
in today's society,

54:34.688 --> 54:37.649
there's

54:34.688 --> 54:37.649
very little opportunity

55:18.190 --> 55:22.987

55:23.028 --> 55:25.697
They bring it to us

55:23.028 --> 55:25.697
on a personal basis,

55:25.739 --> 55:26.657
because they lived it.

55:25.739 --> 55:26.657
They were there.

55:28.951 --> 55:30.494
[cheering]

55:49.138 --> 55:50.931
It really gets me,

55:49.138 --> 55:50.931
I mean, here,

55:50.973 --> 55:53.517
I mean,

55:50.973 --> 55:53.517
really gets me.

55:53.558 --> 55:57.104
I know when I started

55:53.558 --> 55:57.104
in the mid-'90s,

55:57.146 --> 55:59.857
a lot of these people

55:57.146 --> 55:59.857
were in their 70s

55:57.146 --> 55:59.857
and early 80s.

55:59.898 --> 56:02.526
And I was thinking,

55:59.898 --> 56:02.526
"Boy, you know,

56:02.567 --> 56:05.279
"it's such a privilege

56:02.567 --> 56:05.279

56:07.114 --> 56:09.033
gonna be gone."

56:09.074 --> 56:11.910
Well, 15 years later,

56:09.074 --> 56:11.910
most of them are still here,

56:11.952 --> 56:14.788
which is--

56:11.952 --> 56:14.788
completely blows my mind.

56:14.830 --> 56:16.372
There are still people

56:14.830 --> 56:16.372

56:27.176 --> 56:29.136
I'll stop dancing

move any more.

56:29.178 --> 56:31.222
And then I might

56:31.263 --> 56:33.389

56:31.263 --> 56:33.389

that is so rewarding

56:54.036 --> 56:57.497
about this

56:57.539 --> 56:59.666
is I can see

56:57.539 --> 56:59.666
that this activity

56:57.539 --> 56:59.666
heals people's lives.

56:59.708 --> 57:01.919
It's not the activity.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.003
It's the community

57:01.960 --> 57:03.003
combined with

57:01.960 --> 57:03.003
the activity.

57:07.799 --> 57:11.427
Now, I can also say

57:07.799 --> 57:11.427
from a personal aspect

57:07.799 --> 57:11.427
that this is so true,

57:11.469 --> 57:15.307
because in 2000,

57:11.469 --> 57:15.307
I had an accident with

57:11.469 --> 57:15.307
my dance partner Peter.

57:15.349 --> 57:17.184
We were practicing

57:15.349 --> 57:17.184
our aerials

57:17.226 --> 57:19.603
to make sure we had

57:17.226 --> 57:19.603
our timing right,

57:19.644 --> 57:21.605
and suddenly

57:19.644 --> 57:21.605
it just went bad,

57:19.644 --> 57:21.605
and as I'm diving,

57:21.646 --> 57:23.440
I'm supposed to be able

57:21.646 --> 57:23.440
to catch his legs,

57:23.481 --> 57:24.775
and I realize

57:23.481 --> 57:24.775
he's not there.

57:24.816 --> 57:26.484
And there's nothing

57:24.816 --> 57:26.484
for me to do,

57:26.526 --> 57:28.946
there's no time for me

57:26.526 --> 57:28.946
put my hands down,

57:28.987 --> 57:32.116
so I landed on my head

57:28.987 --> 57:32.116
from eight feet

57:28.987 --> 57:32.116
straight down,

57:32.157 --> 57:34.492
and I heard

57:32.157 --> 57:34.492
all this crunching

57:32.157 --> 57:34.492
and cracking,

57:34.534 --> 57:35.786
and then I

57:34.534 --> 57:35.786
couldn't feel my body.

57:38.163 --> 57:39.831
I wasn't breathing,

57:39.873 --> 57:41.625

57:41.666 --> 57:42.626
'cause I was paralyzed.

57:45.337 --> 57:48.715
I ended up

57:45.337 --> 57:48.715
breaking my neck in

57:45.337 --> 57:48.715
five different places.

57:48.757 --> 57:50.675
I was at death's door,

and the swing dance

57:52.094 --> 57:54.888
went like this

57:52.094 --> 57:54.888
and lifted me up

57:54.930 --> 57:56.723
and held me

57:54.930 --> 57:56.723
in their little hands

57:56.765 --> 57:58.058
until everything

57:56.765 --> 57:58.058
was okay.

58:01.853 --> 58:04.815
I had over 500 e-mails

58:01.853 --> 58:04.815
printed out, cut out,

58:04.856 --> 58:07.734
and my hospital room

58:04.856 --> 58:07.734

58:07.776 --> 58:09.820

58:09.861 --> 58:11.655
and a phone call.

it was incredible,

58:13.573 --> 58:15.909

58:15.951 --> 58:17.828
that was healing.

a chemistry between

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:56.648
Emelie and Steven

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.692
from the very first time

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.692
they met.

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:03.196
Hey, Emelie.

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:09.160
What happened

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:09.160
last night?

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:10.454
Did you?! Did you?!

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:11.955
[laughing]

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.166
No, we had some drinks.

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:20.797
No. Yeah.

01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:22.466
This is

01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:22.466
my Swedish girlfriend.

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.217
Get her face.

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.217
She's got the good face.

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:26.010
I love her.

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:26.010

01:03:29.847 --> 01:03:31.683
It is easy, but, no--

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.059
Oh. Oh,

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.059
you're cheek rubbing.

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:34.978
Ahh.

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:34.978
Aww.

01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:38.148
They're both

01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:38.148
very flirtatious types,

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:40.984
so, I mean,

01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:42.902
I didn't expect

01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:42.902
anything else.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:46.156
Oh? What?

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:49.033
Oh, I mean, that's

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:49.033
just how those weekend

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:49.033
workshops work, though.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:51.662
You go to a dance event.

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.497
Sometimes you dance

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.497
with somebody--

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:55.332
You got

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:55.332
good chemistry with.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.167
You know, you guys

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.167
feel each other,

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:58.835

01:03:58.876 --> 01:04:02.380
Everything's very fast,

01:03:58.876 --> 01:04:02.380
you know.

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:05.883
And you have

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:05.883
to say good-bye,

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:05.883
and--[laughs]

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:08.679
You don't know when

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:08.679
you're gonna meet again.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.555
you go to a couple

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.555
other dances.

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:12.516
You run into someone

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:12.516
you feel real good--

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:14.934
I mean, you just--

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:14.934
Workshops.

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:16.227

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.729
You meet people

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.729
you like.

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.690
Hey, that's--

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.690
I'm not a whore.

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.692
I haven't slept with

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.692
any of these girls.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:23.443
I'm just saying.

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:24.194
You make

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:24.194
some connections.

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:29.616
Whoo!

01:04:29.658 --> 01:04:30.450
Whoo!

01:04:29.658 --> 01:04:30.450
Holy--

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:32.243
[laughs]

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:39.710
One of my favorite quotes

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:39.710
about Lindy Hop is this,

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:42.212
"The biggest cartoon wins."

That's the bottom line.

Lindy Hoppers

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:22.419
hate rules.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:26.005
I made the decision when I

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:26.005
started my competition event

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.341
that I was gonna leave it

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.341
as rule-free as possible.

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.180
We're more interested

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.180
in someone getting up

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:37.183
and making a fool

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:37.183
of themselves in a way

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:38.142
that allows everyone

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:38.142
to participate

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.617
with anything,

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:54.659
I would say it's like

the Burning Man

a big party and just buy

01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:33.323
a bunch of beer.

It's a very satisfying thing

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:41.892
to walk into a place

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:44.394

all over the world,

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:50.066
I don't know when

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:50.066
I'll get to see them again.

01:07:50.107 --> 01:07:53.110
I give them as much

01:07:50.107 --> 01:07:53.110
as I can in that weekend,

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:56.907

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:56.907
and foster or nurture them.

establishing roots,

from the thought of it,

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:18.469
and I say that,

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:18.469
because I think I do that.

My profession and my job

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:30.481
in my personal life,

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:34.484
I have a really hard time

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:36.112
maintaining that

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:36.112
for myself.

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:42.201

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:42.201
so much on the road,

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:45.997
and it's hard

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:45.997
to have everyday friends,

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:49.292
and it's hard

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:49.292
to stay in contact

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:49.292
with those you love.

passed away, my mom's dad,

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:57.675
and I wasn't able

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:57.675
to go home to be

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:57.675
with the family

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.135
or even to be

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.135
at his funeral,

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.135
'cause I was in Germany.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:04.140
Being 33,

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:04.140
I should think about

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.350
my retirement account

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.350
and all these things.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:07.143
You know, "What am

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:07.143

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:07.143

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:17.528
any other work

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:20.323
that would be something

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:20.323
to fall back onto.

01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:22.198
I've worked

01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:22.198
at coffee shops.

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:25.495
I could maintain this

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:25.495
for a long time,

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:30.332
and I've seen people do it

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:30.332
well until their mid-40s.

01:09:30.374 --> 01:09:32.669
You get

01:09:30.374 --> 01:09:32.669
to experience so much,

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:35.171
probably so much more

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:35.171
than other people do,

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:37.048
but then you have

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:37.048
to ask yourself,

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.049
what's the priority

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.049
in life?

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.219
'Cause you know

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.219
we don't last forever,

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.763
and we definitely

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.763
can't dance forever.

01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:48.600
In August,

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:50.560
we had bought tickets

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:50.560
for Seattle.

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:51.938
We were

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:51.938
just about to leave.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:56.860
And it was actually

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:56.860
during practice

01:09:56.901 --> 01:10:00.363
that I had

01:09:56.901 --> 01:10:00.363
felt chest pain.

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:02.365
You had thought it was

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:02.365
some inflammation, right?

01:10:02.406 --> 01:10:04.075
Yeah.

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:05.743
Like from aerials

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:05.743
or something.

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:09.205
I did not think

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:09.205
it was cancer.

01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:12.625
Because, yeah,

01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:12.625
that was like...

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:13.626
eh...

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:13.626
Yeah.

01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:14.251
Yeah.

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:19.757
It was a--

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:19.757
It was a big tumor,

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:23.136
like the size

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:23.136
of a large egg.

01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:26.472
They told me that day

01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:26.472
that I had to cancel

01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:26.472
my trip

01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:29.893
and that I needed

01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:29.893
to have surgery.

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:32.062
When Rebecka called me

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:32.062
the first time,

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:35.106
I understood right away

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:38.442
that it would be, like,

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:38.442
a lot of bad things

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:38.442
happening from now on

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.154
and that I would be scared

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.154
a lot of times,

01:10:41.196 --> 01:10:43.740
so I guess

01:10:41.196 --> 01:10:43.740
I kind of decided

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:46.743
that I had to take, like,

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:46.743
one step at a time.

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:53.791
I started taking

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:53.791
photos of Rebecka

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:53.791
when she was sick,

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:57.253
mostly because I needed

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:57.253
to do something creative.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:06.930
I also wanted

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:06.930
the swing dance community

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:06.930
be able to follow her,

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.640
because suddenly

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.640
we couldn't travel,

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:13.144
and we couldn't be

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:13.144
everywhere anymore.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:17.148
And we still felt that support

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:17.148
from the swing scene.

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:22.612
On that photo,

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:24.948
you kind of look

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:24.948
a little bit like a warrior.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:32.455
I was a bit reluctant

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:32.455
from the beginning,

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:35.208
because it was

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:35.208
very revealing,

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:38.211
me, like,

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:38.211
having no hair, no--

01:11:38.253 --> 01:11:41.631
and with the surgery

01:11:38.253 --> 01:11:41.631
and everything.

01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:44.217
For me, she was so strong,

01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:47.845
and I wanted

01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:47.845
to show that to her,

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:52.475
we could do something

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:52.475
together still.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.521
My treatment

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.521
turned out really long.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:58.731
Uh...

01:11:58.773 --> 01:12:00.357
It was 300 days.

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:01.400
Was it?

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:02.652
Yeah.

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.737
Okay, good.

01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:05.362
Keep track.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.037
Many times,

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.037
I've been thinking,

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:17.667
like, I would

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:17.667
never be able to--

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:17.667
to dance more.

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:22.672
You kind of

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:22.672
have to appreciate what

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:22.672
your body does for you

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:23.840
so you just

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:23.840
don't take things

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:23.840
for granted as much.

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:46.403
Well, you know,

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:46.403
if I didn't have

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:49.866
a single material thing

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:49.866
of Frankie's,

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:52.035
I--I still would never

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:52.035
stop thinking of him.

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:53.410
[music playing]

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:00.710
Frankie passed,

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:00.710
and for three days,

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:00.710
they celebrated...

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:02.378
dancing.

01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:04.255
LENNART:

01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:04.255
I feel kind of sad

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:06.257
for people coming

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:06.257
into the dance today

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.885
that never will

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.885
have the opportunity

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:12.222
to meet a person with

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:12.222
the personality that

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:12.222
Frankie Manning had.

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:14.057
His wish before he passed

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.726
was to see it

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.726
come back in Harlem,

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:19.270
and I was just

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:19.270
telling him, "Don't worry.

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:19.270
It will. It will."

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:22.732
From here on out,

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:26.402
it's about

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:26.402
teaching people

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:26.402
what he taught me.

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:31.282
When Frankie passed,

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:34.327
certainly a big piece

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:34.327
of my life was over.

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:36.746
I--I would say,

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:36.746
"Frankie, what should I do?

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.748
How should I go on?"

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:41.000
You know, I'd say that

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:41.000
to the universe,

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:45.755
and I'd always hear

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:45.755
in my mind the same thing,

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:49.008
and it was Frankie's voice

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:49.008
saying, "Dance. Dance."

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:52.428
I listened,

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:52.428
and I started dancing.

01:13:52.469 --> 01:13:55.598
I just pushed myself

01:13:52.469 --> 01:13:55.598
out there.

01:13:55.639 --> 01:13:58.809
It was so uplifting.

01:13:55.639 --> 01:13:58.809
It was so wonderful.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:00.770
It was such happiness to me

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:03.022
and still is to this day.

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:04.941
It's the biggest happiness

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:04.941
in my life.

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:14.784
Frankie always said

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:14.784
that there would be no wars

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:14.784
if everybody danced,

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:17.120
and I know that sounds

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:17.120
a little extreme or

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:17.120
a little bit grandiose,

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:18.788
but I have seen it.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:21.707
It is impossible

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:21.707
to hate somebody

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:23.209
once you've

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:23.209
danced with them.

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:32.509
Something that

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:32.509
saddens me a bit

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:32.509
about American culture

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:35.679
is how polarized we seem

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:35.679
to have become as a nation

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:40.226
and that people are

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:40.226
this, that, or the other,

01:14:40.268 --> 01:14:44.647
and their friends

01:14:40.268 --> 01:14:44.647
are like-minded

01:14:40.268 --> 01:14:44.647
this, that, or the other.

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:47.483
And what's pretty phenomenal

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:47.483
about swing dancing

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:49.819
is that you're gonna

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:49.819
find everybody there.

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:55.241
It's very common,

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:55.241
like with Facebook

01:14:55.283 --> 01:14:57.910
that you see, "Oh, my God,

01:14:57.952 --> 01:15:00.204
this is

01:14:57.952 --> 01:15:00.204
their religious belief

01:14:57.952 --> 01:15:00.204
or their political belief,"

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.165
and you would think,

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.165
"I would never want

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.165
to talk to this person.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.833
Like, ugh."

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:06.169
And yet,

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:06.169
your connection with them

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:10.423
on the dance floor

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:10.423
was beautiful.

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:13.509
Any of us could go

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:13.509
to pretty much any country

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:13.509
in the world

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.719
and look up

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.719
the local Lindy Hoppers

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:19.182
and not only get advice

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:19.182
on where to go dancing,

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:22.852
but probably a dinner out

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:22.852
with all of the local dancers,

01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:26.022
somewhere to stay,

01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:26.022
a lifelong friend,

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:28.565
a--a spouse.

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:28.565
You know, who knows?

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:31.402
Just because you're

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:31.402
a fellow Lindy Hopper,

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:36.407
you're automatically

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:36.407
accepted and welcomed.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:38.701
JOHN: I started to see

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:38.701
this--this community

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:40.536
as much more than

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:40.536
just a bunch of people

01:15:40.577 --> 01:15:41.871
who get together

01:15:40.577 --> 01:15:41.871
and dance.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:44.207
We have

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:44.207
a really strong bond.

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:46.376
That's probably

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:46.376
the most amazing

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:46.376
thing about it,

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.961
is you meet somebody

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.961
that you don't even

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.961
know, and you dance,

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:49.962
and you feel

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:49.962
like you've known

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:49.962
each other forever.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:58.221
So same thing,

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:58.221
you know, this person

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:58.221
believes this politics

01:15:58.262 --> 01:15:59.596
or, you know,

01:15:58.262 --> 01:15:59.596
believes this about guns

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:02.225
or has

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:02.225
this sexual preference,

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:04.560
and--and you may be

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:04.560
completely at odds or

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:04.560
in opposition to them,

01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:08.898
and yet none

01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:08.898
of that matters.

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:12.735
It's all superficial things

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:12.735
that we stack

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:12.735
onto ourselves,

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:15.654
and it's not really

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:15.654
who we are in our hearts

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:15.654
or our souls,

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:19.325
and the dance gets us

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:19.325
closer to our hearts

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:19.325
and our souls.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.254
Got a gal

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.254
in New Orleans...

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:33.339
EMELIE:

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:33.339
I'm really happy

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:33.339
that we can go,

01:16:33.381 --> 01:16:36.467
because last year,

01:16:33.381 --> 01:16:36.467
we couldn't go.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:39.262
There are two couples

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:39.262
battling each other.

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.264
Couple 176!

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:43.266
176!

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.309
That's Rebecka and Emelie!

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.520
The judges

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.520
have to, like,

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:49.522
point to

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:49.522
a couple they think

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:49.522
they're the best.

01:16:49.564 --> 01:16:51.857
Dancing against

01:16:49.564 --> 01:16:51.857
couple 174.

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:53.443
To win...

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:55.361
You have to battle

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:55.361
eight times

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:57.863
and win

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:57.863
all those battles.

01:16:57.905 --> 01:16:59.990
All right, you guys

01:16:57.905 --> 01:16:59.990
know what's up.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:02.535
Take your place

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:02.535
on the floor.

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:05.288
I don't really

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:05.288
have any expectation

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:05.288
on this competition.

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:06.622
[swing music playing]

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:37.320
[cheering]

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:40.156
Emelie and Rebecka!

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:07.724
This past year

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:07.724
has been about

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:07.724
so much other stuff

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:09.519
that has been

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:09.519
more important,

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.187
because it has to do

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.187
with life and not life.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.860
What I think about now

01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.612
is some people

01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.612
are taking this

01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.612
so seriously.

01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:37.547
It just feels great that we

01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:37.547
can be in the competition.

01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:55.064
Here we go.

01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:55.064
1, 2, 3.

01:18:55.105 --> 01:18:57.608
Boom!

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:02.613
Chance and Lisa are

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:02.613
going on to the finals!

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:05.575
Put your hands together

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:05.575
for both of these

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:05.575
amazing couples.

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:07.076
[applause]

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:11.955
I'm really proud of us,

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:13.416
especially myself,

01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:14.750
very proud of myself.

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:17.253
[laughs]

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:17.253
Yay.

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:18.754
[both laughing]

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:23.967
STEVE: 5, 6, 7, 8.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:26.095
1, 2, forward, turn!

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:29.265
In, out, triple.

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:30.600
CHANZIE:

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:30.600
One of the things that we're

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:30.600
really passionate about

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:32.643
is bringing

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:32.643
people together.

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:34.604
We started three teams

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:34.604
at--in September.

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:37.440
Rock it.

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:37.440
All of them tell us

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:38.441
that this is what

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:38.441
they look forward to

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:38.441
every week.

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:39.609
Hit.

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:44.947
It's really

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:44.947
about making something

01:19:44.988 --> 01:19:46.949
where anybody

01:19:44.988 --> 01:19:46.949
can get involved,

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.785
anybody of any level,

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.785
any age,

01:19:49.826 --> 01:19:52.705
um, 'cause that's

01:19:49.826 --> 01:19:52.705
a community.

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:54.164
You know, you don't

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:54.164
just have a community

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:54.164
of, like, 20-year-olds,

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:55.791
community of everybody.

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:07.344
We went to Europe

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:07.344
for the first time

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:07.344
this year.

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.346
In February.

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:10.640
That was really exciting.

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:10.640
It was amazing.

01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:11.807
And Norma Miller

01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:11.807
had an interview.

01:20:11.848 --> 01:20:12.975
It was so awesome.

01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:14.685
It's like, "Stand up!"

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:17.396
She made us stand up,

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:17.396
and she's like--

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:19.356
She's, like--

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:19.356
made everyone,

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:19.356
like, applaud for us,

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.567
and she was like,

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.567
"If you ever get

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.567
the opportunity

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.486
to take lessons

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.486
from them, you--

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.486
you have to do it."

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:25.571
I seriously

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:25.571
just got watery eye,

01:20:25.613 --> 01:20:27.490
like, "I'm not

01:20:25.613 --> 01:20:27.490
about to cry, man."

01:20:25.613 --> 01:20:27.490
[laughs]

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:29.825
But that was amazing.

01:20:29.866 --> 01:20:32.578
It just, uh,

01:20:29.866 --> 01:20:32.578
felt good to hear that

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.163
from someone,

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.163
you know, I've worshiped

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.163
and stuff.

01:20:34.204 --> 01:20:34.830
That you admire so much.

01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:48.010
Every moment that I walk

01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:48.010
back into my own home,

01:20:48.051 --> 01:20:50.220
every moment

01:20:48.051 --> 01:20:50.220
that I get to see

01:20:48.051 --> 01:20:50.220
my hats and my shoes,

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:53.182
I'm just like,

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:53.182
"It's me again."

01:20:53.223 --> 01:20:54.391
[laughs]

01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:56.686
I love New York City,

01:20:56.727 --> 01:21:00.690
I want to be and live

01:20:56.727 --> 01:21:00.690
and work in New York City.

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:03.275
I'm ready to invest

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:03.275
and create something

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:05.861
that's bigger than myself,

01:21:05.902 --> 01:21:08.280
that will last longer

01:21:05.902 --> 01:21:08.280
than my body.

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:11.367
And a lot of that

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:11.367
is this dance company

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:13.202
that Michael Jagger

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:13.202
and I are working on.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.621
It involves

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.621
saying no to work

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:18.624
so that I'm not traveling

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:18.624
quite as much.

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:21.711
It involves learning things

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:21.711
I had--I know nothing about,

01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:26.256
like LLCC double-Q

01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:26.256
tax stuff, and--

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.133
Everybody's afraid

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.133
of taxes, and ugh.

01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:30.720
And I love it,

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.639
because it's a whole 'nother

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.639
different satisfaction

01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:39.478
to foster talent

01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:39.478
in your base

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.979
and look at that

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.979
and say, "I made that."

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:42.398
Yeah!

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:42.398
[cheering]

01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.567
Bravo!

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:47.319
We're also doing work

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:47.319
with Harlem Swings

01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:49.446
and the high school kids

01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:49.446
in Harlem.

01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:50.947
This is really exciting

01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:50.947
for the dancers,

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:52.449
for me,

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:52.449
for the company members,

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:55.077
and then also

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:55.077
for these kids,

01:21:55.118 --> 01:21:56.995
and I really think

01:21:55.118 --> 01:21:56.995
Frankie would be

01:21:55.118 --> 01:21:56.995
very happy about that.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:05.588
People always

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:05.588
ask us, like,

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:09.132
if you are okay now,

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:09.132
if, like, the cancer is gone,

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:13.262
and you can

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:13.262
never say it's gone,

01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:15.180
because you don't know

01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:15.180
if it's gone,

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:16.139
and it can come back.

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:21.854
If your safety

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:21.854
is threatened,

01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:24.356
then I think it's

01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:24.356
a tendency for people

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.817
to try to build

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.817
some kind of...

01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:28.485
Security.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.780
Yeah.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.780
It's an illusion, but--

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:32.531
because you're

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:32.531
never safe.

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:35.701
You have to live

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:35.701
in the moment

01:22:35.743 --> 01:22:37.661
and take

01:22:35.743 --> 01:22:37.661
one day at a time.

01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:46.670
EVITA: So many people

01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:46.670
think that happiness

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:50.800
is this passive thing

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:50.800
where you have to wait

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:52.301
until something happens,

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:52.301
and then you'll be happy...

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:57.807
this idea that it's

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:57.807
always a step away,

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.391
that it's not

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.391
in our reach.

01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:04.563
You can go dancing,

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.816
and you remember

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.816
that happiness

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.816
is always within you.

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:12.863
GEORGE: But I was

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:12.863
very privileged

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:15.365
to meet Mr. Count Basie,

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.993
and I'd just like

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.993
to share his philosophy

01:23:18.034 --> 01:23:20.329
that applies

01:23:18.034 --> 01:23:20.329
to everything in life,

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.581
and, uh, he says,

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.581
"Persevere,

01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:25.167
"persevere,

01:23:25.208 --> 01:23:27.169
persevere." Three words.

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.005
Or is it one word,

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.005
right, three times.

01:23:30.046 --> 01:23:31.757
[laughs]

01:23:31.799 --> 01:23:34.384
EVITA: It awakens you,

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:37.387
quickens your heart,

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:37.387
and you breathe deeper.

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:40.390
You laugh. You yell out,

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.351
and that's being alive.

01:23:44.227 --> 01:23:47.397
That is being alive.

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.192
We've been

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.192
in the presence

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.192
of Frankie Manning,

01:23:50.233 --> 01:23:53.111
and he has given us

01:23:50.233 --> 01:23:53.111
his spirit

01:23:53.153 --> 01:23:55.781
to heal the world,

01:23:53.153 --> 01:23:55.781
to make it a new place.

01:23:55.823 --> 01:23:57.032
God bless you!

01:23:57.073 --> 01:24:00.202
Dance! Dance! Dance!

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:01.411
[cheering]

01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:02.579
1, 2

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.540
1, 2, 3, 4

01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:05.791
[swing music playing]

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:29.231
[cheering]

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:41.243
[jazz playing]

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:50.145
Listen, brothers and sisters

01:25:50.186 --> 01:25:54.066
Have you met

01:25:50.186 --> 01:25:54.066
that old mister?

01:25:54.108 --> 01:25:56.652
When you do,

01:25:54.108 --> 01:25:56.652
he'll grab you by the toe

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.695
And he will never let you go

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:01.323
Talking 'bout Mr. Rhythm

01:26:01.364 --> 01:26:04.910
If your woman is cheating

01:26:04.952 --> 01:26:08.664
Or your man

01:26:04.952 --> 01:26:08.664
says he's leaving

01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:11.667
Better get yourself

01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:11.667
some dancing shoes

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:14.169
And syncopate

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:14.169
your weary blues

01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:17.589
Shuffling along

01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:17.589
with Mr. Rhythm

01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:21.677
Now Mr. Melody

01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:21.677
sounds mighty fine to me

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:25.347
When he croons

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:25.347
a tune of love

01:26:25.388 --> 01:26:28.517
He sings to me so sweet

01:26:25.388 --> 01:26:28.517
and knocks me off my feet

01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:30.853
But Mr. Rhythm

01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:30.853
picks me back up

01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:34.564
If you feel like a sad sack

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:38.527
Mr. Rhythm has what you lack

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:41.530
Better get yourself

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:41.530
some jive, Jack

01:26:41.571 --> 01:26:43.949
Lay back,

01:26:41.571 --> 01:26:43.949
and let yourself relax

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:45.534
Leave everything

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:45.534
to Mr. Rhythm

01:26:46.305 --> 01:26:52.738
