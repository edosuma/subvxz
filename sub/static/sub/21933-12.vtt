WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:04.438
Hey. Eggnog's ready.
Oh.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.440
I put some brandy in,

00:06.507 --> 00:08.776
not knowing Kendra
had already
added some rum.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.979
Bottom line, it's gonna be
a very merry Christmas.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.050
I could go for a little nog
after setting up those lights.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.851
Jack, you're too young.
It's only for us adults.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.488
Ah! Nice try, Sara.

00:20.554 --> 00:23.191
Come on, there's kid eggnog
in the fridge.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.692
Let me
get this straight.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.894
You really
didn't get me a gift?
You're kidding, right?

00:26.960 --> 00:28.762
No. We said
we weren't exchanging.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.364
Yeah, but I thought we were
doing the thing where we say

00:30.431 --> 00:32.566
we're not getting gifts,
but we do anyway.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.768
Then you thought wrong.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.537
Well, still,
I got you one.

00:36.604 --> 00:37.671
I don't want it.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.173
It's a gift.
You got to take it.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.509
Says who?
Says the rules.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.546
Look, I, I got you one.
Now I want mine.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.047
Well, then take the one
you were gonna give me

00:47.115 --> 00:48.316
and give it to yourself.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.351
No!
I don't want golf balls!

00:52.686 --> 00:54.054
By the way,
I got you golf balls.

00:56.023 --> 01:01.095
* I am not your
ordinary guy *

01:01.162 --> 01:02.896
Hey, how we lookin' on
the lights, people?

01:02.963 --> 01:04.765
We are good to go,
Mr. Gable.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.534
All right, Jackie boy,
hit it.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.602
Hey, hey!
Yeah!

01:08.669 --> 01:09.670
There you go.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.172
So, can we open
our presents now?

01:11.239 --> 01:15.209
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow your roll, playa,
all right?

01:15.276 --> 01:17.778
You know the rule.
Every Christmas Eve...

01:17.845 --> 01:19.247
We get one gift
from Santa.

01:19.313 --> 01:22.049
That's right,
and I hand them out.
Let's do it.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.484
So you're saying
you're Santa?

01:23.551 --> 01:25.953
No, I'm saying I'm the guy
in charge of handing out...

01:26.019 --> 01:27.087
Do you want
to play this game?

01:27.155 --> 01:29.157
I do not.
Yeah.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.126
Come in!

01:33.461 --> 01:34.895
Hey.
Hey.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.964
Merry Christmas,
everybody.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.933
I just wanted to drop a few
gifts off for the kids.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.569
All right,
well, take a seat.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.437
Come on. Yeah, what can we
get you to drink?

01:43.504 --> 01:45.539
You want an eggnog?
A hot toddy?

01:45.606 --> 01:46.674
What, do you have
a hot toddy?

01:46.740 --> 01:48.342
I don't.
I-I just like saying it.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.378
Hot toddy?
Anybody for a hot toddy?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.980
Anybody

01:53.046 --> 01:56.016
I do it every year.
Every year, I toddy it up.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.718
That's cute.
No, I... I'm good.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.787
I just want to get home
and get into my PJs.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.722
Wait. What?
But it's Christmas Eve.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.257
Yeah.
It's kind of my thing.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.393
You know,
I turn on my fake fireplace,

02:05.459 --> 02:10.231
have some wine, karaoke
Donna Summer until I pass out.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.566
All right, look,
it's not up for discussion.
You're staying.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.968
Chale, can you do me a favor?
Can you get her a nog?

02:15.035 --> 02:16.737
Come on.
All right.
Thank you.

02:16.804 --> 02:17.871
Oh, I almost forgot.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.373
Got you
a little something.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.310
Ah. What is this?

02:22.376 --> 02:24.011
A box of doughnuts?

02:24.077 --> 02:26.079
Yeah, from the night
we met.
I'm confused.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.049
Christmas Eve.
Thank you.
23 years ago.

02:29.116 --> 02:32.453
Oh, that's why
the doughnuts.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.455
I still don't get it.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.789
How do you not get it?

02:35.856 --> 02:37.825
If I say I get it,
can I just...
Can I eat the doughnuts?

02:37.891 --> 02:41.094
I am talking about the night
we became partners.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.763
I... I'm blanking.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.465
Okay.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.801
We were rookies.
We got stuck working together.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.102
I... Really?

02:51.539 --> 02:54.908
Hey. How you doing?
Vanessa Cellucci.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.777
Kevin Gable.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.347
Oh.
Happens to all of us.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.581
Excuse me.
Yeah.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.151
Car 217.
Uh, in service.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.654
Sorry for the delay.
Was awaiting partner.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.989
We're moving now.
15 minutes late.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.559
Due to Cellucci.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.893
Ready to do this?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.027
Wow.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.263
One second.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.731
(SIREN CHIRPING ERRATICALLY,
BUTTONS CLICKING)

03:19.267 --> 03:20.934
What...

03:21.001 --> 03:22.336
What are you...
What are you doing?

03:22.403 --> 03:25.506
Just testing the equipment.
I like to give it a
roundabout.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.841
I'm pretty...
I'm pretty sure it works.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.344
I'll decide if
and when she works.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.681
It works.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.783
Thank you.
I feel so much safer now.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.151
Sandwich?
No, thanks.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.787
Training. For the NFL.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.658
Oh, you're serious.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.660
Deadly.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.497
So, that's your plan?
Professional football player?

03:49.563 --> 03:50.898
That is the plan.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.867
Epic 10-year career
on the gridiron,

03:53.934 --> 03:56.570
then circle it back
to law enforcement.

03:56.637 --> 03:59.840
FBI or
this stays in the car...

03:59.907 --> 04:01.475
CIA.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.545
This doesn't
stay in the car.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.213
You're outta your mind.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.816
You know what?
This engine is fueled

04:08.882 --> 04:11.752
by other people's put-downs,
so just keep me gassed up.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.554
It's fine.
All right.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.890
Come on.

04:16.957 --> 04:20.594
Um, what are you...
What are you doing?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.262
Just these pagers.

04:22.330 --> 04:25.466
Sometimes you got to move 'em
around to get a signal.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.968
Um, that's not how it works,
but okay.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.371
You know what? If you're gonna
keep staring at that thing

04:30.438 --> 04:34.241
while you're behind the wheel,
you might as well
let me drive.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.276
Why would I do that?

04:36.344 --> 04:39.613
Everybody already knows
I'm the best wheelman
at the precinct.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.483
Well, that changes now.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.485
'Cause I'm here.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.555
Oh, right.
Forgot, 1994.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.057
Women's lib.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.461
Whatever you want
to call it,

04:53.527 --> 04:55.729
I'm just...
I'm a better driver.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.331
You're...
You're a better driver?

04:57.398 --> 04:59.533
I'm a better driver.
Okay.  Okay.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.801
O-Okay.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.169
All right, you know what?

05:02.235 --> 05:03.571
We could just
settle this right now.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.738
You want to do it now?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.139
Yeah,
before the Jets call

05:06.206 --> 05:08.509
and your big football career
takes off, of course.

05:08.576 --> 05:09.643
I mean...

05:10.744 --> 05:12.212
Let's do this.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.314
Wait, was he really
that annoying?

05:14.382 --> 05:16.350
I haven't even gotten
to the annoying part yet.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.586
Please, it's called
being a good cop.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.154
Yeah, great story.
Can I have my present now?

05:21.221 --> 05:23.123
Jack take it easy.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.892
It's Christmas, I'm 12.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.126
I wanna open something.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.261
All right, here you guys go.
Okay?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.997
Now, please tell me
you're not doing that thing

05:30.063 --> 05:31.899
where you give us a bad gift
and then the good gifts.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.100
No, I'm not doing anything.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.135
I'm just following
Santa's instructions.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.671
Batteries?
I got the same thing.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.207
Oh. I guess that's what
you guys got this year.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.442
Enjoy it!

05:42.576 --> 05:43.711
Dad, I hate this game.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.513
Can we just go ahead
and get the good gift?

05:45.579 --> 05:47.615
Okay, right there, see,
that is the poor attitude,
because you know what?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.818
You never know
what those batteries
might be for!

05:50.884 --> 05:52.119
Huh?

05:54.087 --> 05:55.823
A drone! What?

05:55.889 --> 05:58.058
Headphones! Thank you.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.393
But these
don't need batteries.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.761
Classic fake-out.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.630
Okay, back to the story.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.532
I'm still confused.
Where do the doughnuts
come in?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.166
I am getting to that.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.267
You ready?

06:07.334 --> 06:10.704
Pfft. Born.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.172
All right,
before we do this, what...

06:12.239 --> 06:13.774
What is the deal
with the pager?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.410
It's a private matter,
all right?

06:16.477 --> 06:17.711
It doesn't pertain to you.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.613
It's a girl.
I didn't say that.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.014
You didn't have to.
What's her name?

06:22.349 --> 06:24.885
If you must know,
her name's Nunya.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.220
Nunya?
Nunya business.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.689
Now get to driving.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.524
All right, buckle up.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.998
Slow down a little bit.
Getting a little...
getting a little unsafe.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.301
Pull up your skirt, Mary.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.885
Okay. All right.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.587
Okay, wait!

07:01.989 --> 07:03.390
Slow down!

07:07.127 --> 07:08.195
Okay!

07:09.863 --> 07:12.700
Big finish!

07:12.766 --> 07:13.801
No, no, no!

07:19.372 --> 07:22.009
And...there.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.844
You said something
about my driving?

07:26.514 --> 07:28.982
Oh, sounds like
Ms. Vanessa

07:29.049 --> 07:32.620
has some mad skills
behind the wheel, yo.

07:35.422 --> 07:38.559
Sorry, I was trying out
a new thing.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.662
Wow, Dad.
So she beat you?

07:42.863 --> 07:45.432
Look at me.
You think she's gonna beat me?

07:46.333 --> 07:47.635
Can you just
drive already?

07:47.701 --> 07:49.436
Gonna give you a little
Knight Rider

07:49.503 --> 07:52.740
with a splash of
Beverly Hills Cop II.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.374
Okay.
By the way,
how's it taste?

07:54.441 --> 07:55.509
How does what taste?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.344
Muh dust!

08:22.102 --> 08:24.371
And that's
how it's done, son.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.007
Car's rolling.
What's that?

08:27.074 --> 08:28.909
Car...is...rolling.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.220
You drove a cop car
into a ditch?

08:40.287 --> 08:43.156
No, what happened
was my driving was sick.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.258
And then I got out
of the car and, yeah,

08:45.325 --> 08:47.460
i-it rolled into a ditch.
So that did... It happened.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.062
All right, you know what?
Let's just, uh,
keep in moving.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.330
What do you say

08:50.397 --> 08:52.132
Uh, Kendra and Chale,
here you go.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.101
Oh! Thank you.
Huh?

08:55.502 --> 08:57.905
Oh, batteries.
I love it.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.673
I wonder what
these could go with.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.174
Oh, no.
You're doing it wrong.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.176
It's supposed to be,
"Ooh, batteries! I love it.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.712
"I wonder what these
could go with."

09:06.914 --> 09:08.515
Oh, what

09:08.582 --> 09:10.450
This is actually awesome.
Thank you, Dad.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.952
Yeah.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.354
Oh, a power strip!

09:14.421 --> 09:16.724
I wonder what I could
plug into this.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.894
Whatever you want, guy.

09:20.961 --> 09:24.965
So, excuse me. Will there...
There will be a
companion gift?

09:25.032 --> 09:27.300
No. That's all Santa
wanted you to have.

09:27.367 --> 09:31.504
He knows you're into
electronics and pluggy things,
so go crazy.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.606
Oh.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.375
Oh, uh, there is
a surge protector,

09:35.442 --> 09:37.144
so that's very thoughtful.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.545
Thank you.
KEVIN:
You're very welcome.

09:38.612 --> 09:39.647
All right. Come on.
Dad.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.348
What? He's happy.
KYLE: Hold up.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.151
So, Chale gets an
awesome power strip,
and I get nothin'?

09:44.217 --> 09:45.786
This is a joke.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.424
Uh, okay, so what happened
with the car in the ditch?
Did Dad get in trouble?

09:51.491 --> 09:53.894
Uh, well,
you could say that.

09:53.961 --> 09:57.230
Well, sir, currently the car
is un-driveable.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.834
I don't know.
You might have to talk
to Officer Gable about that.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.871
Yes, he is.
He is so that.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.675
He is so that.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.343
Okay,
thank you so much, sir.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.412
They can't get to us
for another couple of hours.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.614
Okay, what was all that about?
You sold me out?

10:14.682 --> 10:16.249
Oh, yeah.
You see how it feels?

10:16.316 --> 10:19.219
"Uh, we're a minute late
because of Cellucci.
Uh, 215..."

10:19.286 --> 10:20.721
All right. Fine.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.055
We're even, okay?
All right.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.490
It doesn't matter anyway.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.659
I called my brother. He's got
a truck with a winch on it.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.494
He can pull us
out of the ditch.
How long?

10:27.560 --> 10:28.796
I don't know,
about an hour.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.164
Ugh.
So, we're stuck here.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.067
Let's see, I might do
a little moo shu pork.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.104
That sounds good.
Or a little beef lo mein.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.573
You know, maybe
I'll get insane
in the lo mein.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.409
Ooh.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.577
Ooh, I didn't see you,
number 13

10:44.644 --> 10:47.180
with your spicy noodles
coming 'round the outside,

10:47.247 --> 10:49.082
'round the outside.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.419
What are you gonna get?
Soup.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.787
Soup.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.824
Oh, boy.

10:56.890 --> 11:00.093
Okay, you know what? I have
spent about an hour with you,

11:00.160 --> 11:03.030
and I-I pretty much understand
why she is not paging you.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.365
I don't even know
if they know we're here.
I'll be right back.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.500
This guy is killing me.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.371
Hey, sir, can we,
uh, get a waiter...

11:11.438 --> 11:13.173
I'm sorry, sir,
it's $8.50.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.508
If you don't have it,
you gotta go.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.177
Well, you can take
the won tons out.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.112
How much then?
How much then?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.214
You know what?
Do me a favor.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.084
Um, you can just put that
on our tab.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.219
Oh, thank you very much.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.021
Yeah, no problem.
And, hey, here.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.790
Have a merry Christmas,
okay?

11:31.691 --> 11:34.327
Can you get us a waitress
over there? Thanks.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.529
Dad, that's so sweet
you helped that guy out.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.865
Yeah, he gave him $18.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.033
$18?
That's a weird amount.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.570
Well,
that's all he had on him.
He gave him every penny.

11:43.636 --> 11:47.140
And that's when I realized
that your dad was
a decent guy.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.376
I mean, he's done a lot
of other stuff since then

11:49.442 --> 11:51.311
to reverse that, but...

11:53.881 --> 11:55.482
Yeah, kinda like now.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.950
Why would you
do that to Chale?

11:57.017 --> 11:59.219
Oh, no, darling.
I love this.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.254
It... It has seven plugs.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.090
That's like seven
different gifts.
Mm-hmm.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.393
Well, if you don't say
something, I will.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.029
I don't want
to ruin Christmas.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.732
Okay, uh, Vanessa,
we have a homeless man,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.035
$18, and a car in a ditch.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.570
I'm all in. Let's go.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.907
Where is this brother
of yours?

12:19.973 --> 12:23.043
Well,
he's getting off of work.
He'll be here soon.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.179
Oh, yeah.
Fortune cookies.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.681
I wonder what
my future holds.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.417
Yeah.
What does yours say?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.619
"Always make sure your car
is in park"?

12:32.685 --> 12:34.087
Ha!

12:34.154 --> 12:35.923
Come on, man.
That's funny.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.027
"All your fingers
can't be the same length."

12:40.093 --> 12:41.895
What? I don't even know
what that means.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.264
All right, you know, this one,
this one is yours.
Okay.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.836
Oh, my God,
again with the pager?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.904
What is it with this girl?
All right, look.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.540
I met her last week
at Mulcahy's, all right?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.309
We connected. I'm...
I'm waiting for her to call.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.644
So call her.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.047
I don't have her number.
She asked for mine.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.648
Oh, boy.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.616
But it's a good thing.

13:03.683 --> 13:06.119
Yeah, no.
No, it's not a good thing.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.855
Okay, walk me
through the night
that you met her.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.824
All right, well, first off,
I walked up to the bar,

13:10.891 --> 13:14.828
saw my buddy Scotty
and was like, "Wazaaaaaa."

13:15.762 --> 13:18.598
And he was like,
"Wazaaaaa."

13:19.867 --> 13:22.602
I saw my buddy Gerard,
he was like, "Wazaaa..."

13:22.669 --> 13:24.471
Okay. Okay, all right.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.506
Not the...
I don't need the whole...
the whole night.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.176
Just get to the part where you
talked to her, please.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.144
Okay, so I, I
walk up to her...
Yeah.

13:31.211 --> 13:34.681
And I thought about saying,
"Wazaaaa," but I didn't.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.416
Good. Good call.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.518
I decided right then
I was gonna just say,

13:38.585 --> 13:40.153
"You look nice."

13:40.220 --> 13:42.822
And, uh,
I, I bought her a drink.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.724
Okay.
And then, uh, you know,

13:44.791 --> 13:46.459
she asked me
if I was seeing anybody.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.929
And I said,
"Uh, nobody serious."

13:48.996 --> 13:50.297
Oh, boy.
What?

13:50.363 --> 13:52.900
I wanted to let her know
I had other fish on the line.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.467
Do you have other fish
on the line?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.103
I might.
You never know.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.404
Do you have other fish
on the line?

13:57.470 --> 13:58.571
It depends on
how you categorize...
Okay.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.739
Do you have other fish
on the line?

13:59.806 --> 14:01.841
Just answer the question!
No! I don't.

14:01.909 --> 14:05.678
I don't know why guys do this.
This never works.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.380
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

14:07.447 --> 14:09.749
but this girl is never
going to call you.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.618
Like, ever.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.254
This is the saddest
Christmas story ever.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.156
No, you sitting there
with a power strip,

14:16.223 --> 14:17.357
not speaking your mind

14:17.424 --> 14:19.226
is the saddest
Christmas story ever.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.661
You know what?
I can't take it.
No, no. Darling. Darling...

14:21.728 --> 14:23.130
Dad, you need to understand
something.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.098
Darling, darling. Don't.
She's three eggnogs in.
No.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.599
Everybody in the family

14:26.666 --> 14:28.535
gets a bad gift
and then a good gift.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.770
Chale's in the family,
and all he got was a bad one.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.106
Really? Well,
maybe you wanna look again.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.075
Oh, he's right.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.709
We may need
to return this.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.578
It's only for use
in Europe.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.347
Why would Santa
give you something

14:40.413 --> 14:42.749
you can only use in Europe?
Weird.

14:42.815 --> 14:46.719
I don't know. I, I just wish
none of this was happening.

14:46.786 --> 14:50.357
Maybe because he's giving you
a trip...to Italy!

14:51.424 --> 14:52.525
What?
Uh!

14:52.592 --> 14:54.061
You're both going
to the honeymoon

14:54.127 --> 14:56.329
you never had in Rome,
okay?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.898
Oh! Thank you, Dad!
All right? Okay.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.067
Ahh!

15:00.133 --> 15:02.135
It's Christmas.
Just make it fast.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.071
All right, there you go.
There you go.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.306
Rome, huh? Fancy.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.711
Hold on. Wait a second.
I just thought of something.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.981
Mulcahy's?
Didn't you meet Mom
at Mulcahy's?

15:14.047 --> 15:15.148
I did.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.284
So, she's the girl
in the story?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.419
Yep.

15:19.486 --> 15:23.890
Oh, this story just got
mad interesting, yo.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.562
I tried it again. I thought
the second time would save it.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.798
It didn't. It doesn't work.
It doesn't.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.436
All right,
you're good to go.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.938
Hey, never doubt the power
of the Suzuki Samurai.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.974
More than just
a chick magnet.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.176
Thanks.
Now I'm gonna
do you a favor.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.644
Hey, dude,
what are you...

15:44.711 --> 15:46.113
How'd you know
that was a clip

15:46.179 --> 15:47.180
I didn't.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.052
Wow. What's the deal
with this little filly?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.721
Eh, a little thick on the
bottom. I'm diggin' it.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.290
Kyle Gable. FDNY.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.659
Vanessa Cellucci. NGH.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.861
NGH?
Never gonna happen.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.166
Wazaaa!

16:07.967 --> 16:11.271
You know what?
Car's been in a ditch
for a couple hours.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.939
Probably should test
the equipment,

16:13.006 --> 16:14.074
make sure
it's operational.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.976
Touch the sirens
and I cut your hand off.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.612
I'm sure it's fine.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.114
So this girl,
you really like her, huh?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.418
I don't know, just, uh,

16:26.286 --> 16:28.355
something different about her.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.123
I know
it's gonna sound crazy,

16:30.190 --> 16:32.092
but I just think
she might...

16:33.893 --> 16:35.462
She might be the one.
I don't know.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.998
Okay. And your plan
to get her is what?

16:39.066 --> 16:40.933
Sit back and wait for her
to call you?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.070
You know, when you say it like
that, it sounds kinda lame.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.038
Yeah, okay.

16:45.105 --> 16:48.141
What're you doing?
Okay, we're here.
Get out.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.111
We're where?
Your girl's house.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.747
You told me her name,
so I ran it through dispatch.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.549
There were two.
One was 96.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.551
Now, I don't know your type,
but I...

16:58.618 --> 17:00.653
I took a guess and went
with the younger one.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.493
Okay. So, this is the part
where you get out

17:06.559 --> 17:07.827
and you go up there.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.629
Yeah, I am. Okay?
I am. I...

17:09.696 --> 17:11.164
I'm gonna go.
I'm just gonna...

17:11.231 --> 17:13.133
Just gonna...

17:14.734 --> 17:18.638
Hiyah.
La la la la. Laaa.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.006
Buy me a red
leather yellow...

17:20.073 --> 17:22.142
Okay.
Yeah, I'm...
I'm gonna go, okay?

17:22.209 --> 17:24.811
I'm just... You just got
to give me a second.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.950
Yaaaa. Yaaaa.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.420
You're not singing
the National Anthem,

17:33.486 --> 17:35.422
you're just going
to talk to a girl.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.056
Now let's go.
I'm going, okay?

17:37.124 --> 17:38.858
Just, would you gimme
a second, please?

17:38.925 --> 17:40.460
Wow. You are scared.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.395
I'm not...
I'm not scared, okay?

17:42.462 --> 17:44.997
There's a lot of pressure,
and I don't want to look bad.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.100
Yeah, that's scared.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.504
Now, come on.
We drove all the way here.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.174
One of us is leaving with
this girl's phone number.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.178
And I guess
it's gonna be me.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.646
Where you go...
Where you going?

17:59.712 --> 18:01.214
Hey! Hey!

18:01.281 --> 18:03.082
Put in a good word for me!

18:03.150 --> 18:05.552
Okay, wait.
So, if Vanessa hadn't
dragged you over there,

18:05.618 --> 18:07.320
you and Mom would've never
gotten together?

18:07.387 --> 18:09.689
Yes. Yes!
Oh, my God.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.091
So, all of this?
You are welcome.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.093
Oh, are you...
Are you out of
your mind

18:14.161 --> 18:15.228
No, I'm the one
who got us together.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.996
She just...
She set the table.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.766
So what happened?
All right, you're fine.

18:19.832 --> 18:20.967
All you gotta do
is go up there.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.335
What...
What'd you say?

18:22.402 --> 18:23.936
Well, I told her
you were an idiot.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.037
What?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.707
Uh, trust me,
that was not breaking news.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.975
Why would you
say that?

18:29.041 --> 18:31.378
Okay, but then
I told her

18:31.444 --> 18:33.846
that underneath
all that stupidity,

18:33.913 --> 18:35.882
there's like...
three more layers
of bad stuff,

18:35.948 --> 18:38.017
but underneath all that,

18:38.084 --> 18:39.719
there's actually
a decent guy under there,

18:39.786 --> 18:41.087
and she should
give you a shot.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.457
You really
said that about me?
Yeah.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.593
And then we talked about
the night you guys met

18:46.659 --> 18:50.630
and how you did this weird,
crinkled eyebrow thing

18:50.697 --> 18:52.232
with the muddle mouth.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.666
I don't know
what you're talking about.
I don't even do that.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.767
She...kind of like it.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.669
Really?
Yeah.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.137
That's the one.
That is.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.672
There it is.
I can see it.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.208
All right, well then I...
Yeah. I knew it worked.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.709
Get up there.
Get up there.
All right, I'm going.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.010
Hey. Cellucci, thank you.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.111
You're welcome.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.713
Oh, and that
muddle

19:06.779 --> 19:09.148
Yeah.
Like,
small doses maybe.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.250
I disagree.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.458
I can't believe you forgot
everything Vanessa
did for you.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.827
You're right.
I totally forgot.

19:21.428 --> 19:24.697
Or...did I?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.899
Stop. Come on.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.303
"Vanessa, thanks for being
a great partner.

19:30.370 --> 19:34.674
"And remember, all of
your fingers can't be
the same length. Kevin."

19:34.741 --> 19:38.845
I also got you a gift card
for a mud-mask for your face.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.748
Aww, guys,
this is actually
really sweet.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.683
All right,
hold the phone.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.786
Lest we forget,
without my Suzuki Samurai,

19:46.853 --> 19:48.555
none of us would
be here right now.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.657
And once again,
I've been overlooked.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.260
Kyle, we made an agreement.
We're not exchanging gifts.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.627
It was your idea!

19:54.694 --> 19:56.563
All right, well, I'm leaving
with something, okay?

19:56.629 --> 19:59.165
Uh,
these doughnuts right here?
Yeah, these are mine now.

19:59.232 --> 20:02.769
Merry Christmas,
and to all a good night.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.337
Peace out!

20:09.476 --> 20:11.210
Vanessa,
you're blocking me in.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.015
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:16.082 --> 20:19.686
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

20:19.752 --> 20:21.921
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:21.988 --> 20:23.523
* Do, do, do, do

20:23.590 --> 20:27.026
* Oh, yeah

20:27.093 --> 20:30.162
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes

20:30.229 --> 20:32.432
* I just don't want no...
