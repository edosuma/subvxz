he enlisted in the Army,

and I never saw him again.

     once and once only.        

22:08.657 --> 22:11.810
         I am a person          
     who cannot be used.        

22:12.912 --> 22:14.328
    Now if you'll excuse me,    

22:14.362 --> 22:17.698
 I've got to drive Mr. Drake's  
     valet to the airport.      

22:20.836 --> 22:24.439
( <i>laughing and clamoring</i> )      

22:24.473 --> 22:25.773
     Call me a romantic,        

22:25.808 --> 22:29.143
 but I always knew you two      
     would end up together.     

22:29.177 --> 22:31.178
( <i>laughing</i> )                    

22:33.048 --> 22:35.049
I can't believe                 
I kissed <i>you.</i>                   

22:36.217 --> 22:37.051
    Yeah, well, you're lucky    

22:37.086 --> 22:38.403
         I didn't punch         
     your lights out, man.      

22:38.437 --> 22:39.870
    Yeah? You and what army?    

22:39.905 --> 22:41.189
     Hey, hey, hey, guys.       

22:41.223 --> 22:42.257
         Come on, now.          

22:42.291 --> 22:44.159
             Relax.             

22:44.193 --> 22:46.261
        Geez, you guys,         
     you were tricked.          

22:46.295 --> 22:47.528
     It's no big deal.          

22:47.562 --> 22:49.380
            I mean,             
 you're such good friends.      

22:49.415 --> 22:51.149
You mean a lot                  
to each other.                  

22:51.183 --> 22:52.816
I mean,                         
don't walk away mad.            

22:52.851 --> 22:54.285
Go on,                          
kiss and make up.               

22:58.524 --> 23:00.758
         Remember,              
 you both owe me a big wet one. 

23:15.907 --> 23:18.776
        Ah...                   

23:18.810 --> 23:20.811
    Ah, I couldn't stay mad     
         at you, Sam.           

23:20.846 --> 23:22.913
    You're just like            
    a brother to me.            

23:22.948 --> 23:27.501
 Yeah, and if anyone ever does  
knock off the king around here, 

23:27.536 --> 23:30.271
                I guess I hope  
                it's you, man.  

23:30.305 --> 23:31.439
No hard feelings?               

23:31.473 --> 23:32.907
             No hard feelings.  

23:34.576 --> 23:36.210
Listen, Sam,                    
now that everything's okay,     

23:36.245 --> 23:37.745
can I ask you something,        
guy to guy?                     

23:37.779 --> 23:39.180
                Yeah, sure.     

23:39.999 --> 23:41.849
    How was I?                  

23:47.623 --> 23:49.156
            Don't-don't do that.

23:49.190 --> 23:51.158
No, I mean it's a question      
you can't ask a girl.           

23:51.192 --> 23:52.994
I mean, is there anything       
I need to work on?              

23:53.028 --> 23:56.030
     No, see, I-I don't want    
     to talk about this, Woody. 

23:57.365 --> 24:00.467
     I was nervous, so I might  
     have been a little dry.    

24:00.502 --> 24:02.436
Oh, for God's...! Yech!         

24:02.470 --> 24:04.204
         No, I'm serious, Sam.  

24:04.239 --> 24:06.807
    Hey, do you want to know    
         how you were?          

24:07.305 --> 24:13.611
