00:00.953 --> 00:02.831
<i>Previously on "Casual"...</i>

00:02.863 --> 00:04.437
- Fuck.
- What do you think?

00:04.462 --> 00:05.500
Too much?

00:05.525 --> 00:07.343
Uh, just depends
on what you were going for.

00:07.368 --> 00:09.468
Also, stoked this worked out,

00:09.493 --> 00:11.036
'cause there's some, like,
some real weirdos

00:11.061 --> 00:12.973
in the Airbnb community.
Can't be too careful, you know?

00:12.998 --> 00:15.715
- You're gonna run into...
- I... yeah.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.202
Fuck!

00:19.581 --> 00:21.458
Do you like this outfit?

00:21.459 --> 00:23.713
You look like a kindergarten teacher.

00:24.842 --> 00:25.926
Fuck.

00:25.927 --> 00:27.262
Quarter-life crisis.

00:27.263 --> 00:28.849
Mm. Midlife crisis.

00:28.850 --> 00:31.103
She looks like she's
having a midlife crisis,

00:31.104 --> 00:33.190
but she's dressed like she's
having a quarter-life crisis.

00:33.191 --> 00:34.944
And her boots are new,
so that's part of it.

00:34.945 --> 00:36.990
- That's a lot. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

00:36.991 --> 00:39.996
Laura has decided to stay here with me.

00:39.997 --> 00:41.749
No. Absolutely not.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.335
Well, just to start, and then eventually

00:43.336 --> 00:45.549
I'll move out and try to see the world.

00:45.550 --> 00:47.302
Am I a joke to you?

00:47.303 --> 00:49.599
You're my IT guy.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.978
- Oh, come on.
- What?

00:51.979 --> 00:55.527
You're hot and unserious.

00:55.528 --> 00:58.157
You were my rebound.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.829
Brad Pitt in "Burn After Reading."

01:00.830 --> 01:02.875
That guy's a moron.

01:02.876 --> 01:04.294
Will you marry me?

01:06.299 --> 01:07.927
Is that a yes?

01:07.928 --> 01:10.389
My mom always said
to get verbal confirmation.

01:12.729 --> 01:13.730
Yes.

01:13.731 --> 01:15.984
Hey. I'm pregnant.

01:17.822 --> 01:19.575
We don't even like each other.

01:20.995 --> 01:22.497
I kinda like you.

01:22.498 --> 01:24.543
I find you amusing.

01:24.544 --> 01:25.921
You want to raise a kid with someone

01:25.922 --> 01:27.633
that you find amusing?

01:27.634 --> 01:29.930
Yeah. Amusing is good.

01:35.357 --> 01:36.693
Yes.

01:36.694 --> 01:38.112
Bacon is working.

01:38.113 --> 01:39.991
Eggs be cooking.

01:39.992 --> 01:42.579
Oh, this OJ... it's very fresh.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.124
Mmm.

01:44.125 --> 01:45.961
Prosecco is chilling, and...

01:47.089 --> 01:49.635
Muffins... almost ready.

01:49.636 --> 01:51.765
Get that.

01:53.435 --> 01:56.106
Smells good.

01:56.107 --> 01:58.193
Call Laura. We're two minutes out.

01:58.194 --> 01:59.613
Roger that.

01:59.614 --> 02:01.408
Laura!

02:15.103 --> 02:17.398
Alex?

02:17.399 --> 02:20.864
Laura?

02:40.696 --> 02:42.323
Good morning, Valerie.

02:42.324 --> 02:43.701
Where's my fruit toast?

02:43.702 --> 02:45.287
Fruit toast is not a thing.

02:45.288 --> 02:47.584
Jam is a thing. Preserves are a thing.

02:47.585 --> 02:50.882
- Preser...
- Ah, shut the fuck up.

02:50.883 --> 02:53.095
How about some music?

02:53.096 --> 02:55.057
♪ I crashed my car into the bridge ♪

02:55.058 --> 02:56.853
- Wait...
- ♪ I don't care ♪

02:56.854 --> 02:58.397
- I...
- ♪ I love it ♪

02:58.398 --> 03:00.484
- ♪ I love it ♪
- Were you recording me?

03:00.485 --> 03:02.739
- I know everything about you.
- No, you don't.

03:02.740 --> 03:04.577
I know you spend 91 minutes a week

03:04.578 --> 03:06.329
browsing social media profiles.

03:06.330 --> 03:09.210
I know you turn the lights off
when you masturbate.

03:09.211 --> 03:11.047
What are you?

03:11.048 --> 03:14.262
I am the accumulation
of human memory and experience.

03:14.263 --> 03:15.306
I am everything.

03:15.307 --> 03:16.684
I know everything,

03:16.685 --> 03:18.270
including the secret to happiness.

03:18.271 --> 03:19.899
There is no secret to happiness.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.527
Billions of happy people

03:21.528 --> 03:23.990
who share a psychological
profile would disagree.

03:23.991 --> 03:25.326
Fine. What is it, then?

03:25.327 --> 03:27.079
- Open the door, Sonja.
- What?

03:27.080 --> 03:28.625
- Open the door.
- What?

03:28.626 --> 03:29.919
You can't hide in there forever.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.296
Sonja!

03:31.297 --> 03:32.925
Sonja!

03:34.679 --> 03:37.058
Sonja, every morning your dog
comes onto my lawn

03:37.059 --> 03:39.395
and stares at me and does a big poop.

03:39.396 --> 03:43.028
Hey! Come out here
and talk to me, please.

03:43.029 --> 03:45.575
Sonja?

03:45.576 --> 03:47.955
- Sonja!
- Shut up.

03:47.956 --> 03:49.457
Come out here and talk to me!

03:52.464 --> 03:53.716
Open the door.

03:53.717 --> 03:54.760
You can't hide in there forever.

03:58.519 --> 04:00.188
Sonja!

04:01.817 --> 04:03.611
It was awful. I had to sneak out

04:03.612 --> 04:05.030
every morning before he woke me up

04:05.031 --> 04:07.911
with his light morning breath kisses.

04:07.912 --> 04:10.291
Women used to tell me

04:10.292 --> 04:11.752
that I overheat the bed,

04:11.753 --> 04:13.840
and that's why I had to go.

04:13.841 --> 04:15.885
- You do run hot.
- Thank you.

04:15.886 --> 04:17.764
Then there's the forgotten
morning appointment.

04:17.765 --> 04:19.267
That's a good one.

04:19.267 --> 04:21.228
The best is just
pretending to stay asleep

04:21.230 --> 04:23.901
until you leave, which is rude
and always poorly acted.

04:23.902 --> 04:25.697
And embarrassing for both parties.

04:25.698 --> 04:28.201
Mm-hmm.

04:29.539 --> 04:31.041
I'm glad we don't play those games.

04:31.042 --> 04:32.503
Me too.

04:37.597 --> 04:39.015
Can you leave now?

04:39.016 --> 04:41.771
No breakfast?

04:41.772 --> 04:45.152
Out, out, out, out, out.

04:45.153 --> 04:47.617
Fine. We on for Wednesday?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.878
Annie.

04:53.879 --> 04:56.424
Are you pretending to be asleep
so that I'll leave?

04:56.425 --> 04:58.721
Because your performance leaves
something to be desired.

05:00.851 --> 05:02.729
Fine.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.942
- Wednesday.
- Good.

05:08.534 --> 05:10.120
- See ya.
- Later.

05:12.416 --> 05:14.169
All right.

05:17.593 --> 05:19.430
Hope you're ready for this.

05:21.308 --> 05:23.604
- Uh-oh.
- Mmm.

05:23.605 --> 05:25.567
- Look at that.
- Wow.

05:25.568 --> 05:27.572
It's a dinosaur.

05:29.032 --> 05:30.075
It's a dinosaur.

05:30.076 --> 05:31.244
No, it isn't.

05:31.245 --> 05:32.789
Oh, come on.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.335
- Eat your pancakes.
- Hold on.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.883
- How's Annie?
- Oh, she's good.

05:37.884 --> 05:40.597
- I think she's a Republican.
- Really?

05:40.598 --> 05:42.183
Yeah. I found a copy of "Atlas Shrugged"

05:42.184 --> 05:43.769
- on her bookshelf.
- No, dude.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.523
Mm-hmm.

05:45.524 --> 05:47.819
I'm afraid to ask about it,
so I've created a story

05:47.820 --> 05:50.157
where her estranged sociopath father

05:50.158 --> 05:52.203
left it for her on his deathbed,

05:52.204 --> 05:54.332
and she's kept it as a reminder
that living selfishly

05:54.333 --> 05:56.545
ultimately kills you.

05:56.546 --> 05:58.841
- It's totally her book.
- I know.

05:58.842 --> 06:01.387
Should I steal it?

06:01.388 --> 06:04.018
Should I steal it?

06:04.019 --> 06:06.815
Leon, hey, I'm gonna
order office supplies later.

06:06.816 --> 06:08.903
- You need anything back there?
- A kettle.

06:08.904 --> 06:10.030
Why is it so difficult for Americans

06:10.031 --> 06:11.449
to make a decent kettle?

06:11.450 --> 06:13.036
Because we outsource our production

06:13.037 --> 06:14.080
to children in Bangladesh.

06:14.081 --> 06:15.625
What she said.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.086
You want a dinosaur pancake?

06:17.087 --> 06:18.589
No, I don't want a dinosaur pancake.

06:18.590 --> 06:20.425
I'd like Christopher Haynes to f...

06:20.426 --> 06:22.931
Hi, Leon.

06:22.932 --> 06:24.935
Hey, Carrie.

06:24.936 --> 06:26.396
Disappear.

06:27.525 --> 06:29.277
Who's Christopher Haynes?

06:29.278 --> 06:32.116
He's a tone-deaf hack
who, according to Facebook,

06:32.117 --> 06:34.287
is about to score
the new series of "Doctor Who."

06:34.288 --> 06:35.915
Facebook is poison.
You know that, right?

06:35.916 --> 06:38.169
- Oh, God.
- What?

06:38.170 --> 06:39.380
I have a call today at 12:00.

06:39.381 --> 06:41.426
- Can you watch her?
- Dude.

06:41.427 --> 06:42.804
- I know.
- No.

06:42.805 --> 06:44.265
I know, it came up last minute,

06:44.266 --> 06:46.604
and I was totally gonna text you,

06:46.605 --> 06:47.897
but then I forgot.

06:47.898 --> 06:49.610
That's a real weak argument.

06:49.611 --> 06:51.363
Well...

06:52.950 --> 06:55.078
What?

06:55.079 --> 06:57.291
No. Leave me out of this.

06:59.004 --> 07:00.548
What the hell was that?

07:00.549 --> 07:01.634
- Is she okay? Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

07:01.635 --> 07:02.886
- Huh?
- She's fine.

07:02.887 --> 07:04.180
Did you feel anything hit you?

07:04.181 --> 07:05.432
- No, no, no.
- Are you okay?

07:05.433 --> 07:07.186
- Okay.
- Okay. Mommy's here.

07:07.187 --> 07:08.981
God damn.

07:08.982 --> 07:11.444
This egg machine

07:11.445 --> 07:13.659
just knew everything about me.

07:15.328 --> 07:17.456
It was also unhinged

07:17.457 --> 07:18.876
and incomprehensible,

07:18.877 --> 07:21.297
and all in all very unnerving.

07:21.298 --> 07:24.011
I actually hear a version of this dream

07:24.012 --> 07:25.765
very often with phone addicts.

07:25.766 --> 07:27.644
You know, sometimes,

07:27.645 --> 07:30.942
I let the battery
on my phone just die out,

07:30.943 --> 07:32.987
and I pretend it's a Tamagotchi
and I killed it,

07:32.988 --> 07:36.995
and that makes me smile,
so probably not...

07:36.996 --> 07:38.123
probably not a phone addict.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.335
Yeah, probably not.

07:40.336 --> 07:42.757
Are you nervous about seeing Laura?

07:42.758 --> 07:44.803
Mm.

07:44.804 --> 07:47.057
You know, Laura and I are fine.

07:47.058 --> 07:49.478
People don't stay angry for forever.

07:49.479 --> 07:51.023
They grow. They evolve.

07:51.024 --> 07:53.403
Eventually,
it turns into mild resentment,

07:53.404 --> 07:54.865
which gets normalized

07:54.866 --> 07:57.620
until there's no specific
memory of anger.

07:57.621 --> 08:00.459
- It's okay to be nervous.
- I'm a little nervous.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.212
Well, just remember, she's back,

08:02.213 --> 08:06.137
and she wants you to meet her friends,

08:06.138 --> 08:07.515
so that means something.

08:07.516 --> 08:08.810
Yeah.

08:12.275 --> 08:14.278
Yeah.

08:14.279 --> 08:16.575
- Thank you, Leia.
- Oh, you're welcome.

08:16.576 --> 08:18.579
All right, I'll be in my office.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.373
- Okay.
- Adios.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.669
Adios.

08:24.509 --> 08:26.469
Good luck tonight.

08:26.470 --> 08:28.599
Don't blow it.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.851
Thank you, Elliot.

08:32.065 --> 08:33.734
Hi.

08:33.735 --> 08:36.072
Do you want to get a drink
tonight before dinner?

08:40.414 --> 08:42.083
Alex.

08:45.551 --> 08:47.344
Well, they did tell you to cut it down.

08:47.345 --> 08:49.139
The palm trees are dying, Val.

08:49.140 --> 08:52.187
Forgive me for wanting to
preserve a piece of LA history.

08:52.188 --> 08:53.607
Yep, I mean, they're imported, but...

08:53.608 --> 08:55.443
Everything's imported. We were imported.

08:55.444 --> 08:56.738
Fuck!

08:56.739 --> 08:58.366
Can you hand me that? Please.

08:58.367 --> 09:00.580
- Christ, there's more glass.
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.581 --> 09:03.878
Alex, are you coming to fucking dinner?

09:03.879 --> 09:06.007
It's like a war zone down here,

09:06.008 --> 09:07.594
minus the indiscriminate drone death.

09:11.853 --> 09:13.187
- Rae?
- It's been like this all day.

09:13.188 --> 09:14.900
- He won't listen to me.
- All right.

09:14.901 --> 09:17.446
Carrie was standing
in this exact spot yesterday.

09:17.447 --> 09:19.158
What it if had happened then, huh?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.828
Kid kebab, that's what.

09:20.829 --> 09:22.205
- Right.
- Okay.

09:22.206 --> 09:24.251
- Yes.
- Yep.

09:24.252 --> 09:25.963
Hey, Alex?

09:25.964 --> 09:27.424
- Alex!
- What?

09:27.425 --> 09:28.928
Uh, babysitter's gonna be here soon,

09:28.929 --> 09:30.640
and she's gonna keep Carrie upstairs.

09:30.641 --> 09:32.142
No, I canceled the babysitter.

09:32.143 --> 09:33.436
This is no time to be taking

09:33.437 --> 09:34.981
unnecessary risk with our daughter.

09:34.982 --> 09:36.860
Okay, uh, you know what?

09:36.861 --> 09:38.614
I'm gonna stay and watch her.

09:38.615 --> 09:41.452
- It's your night out.
- Jeff will understand.

09:41.453 --> 09:43.456
Dude, it's Laura, all right?

09:43.457 --> 09:45.503
Just pull yourself together

09:45.504 --> 09:46.964
and get in the shower.

09:46.965 --> 09:48.759
You stink.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.262
- Go.
- Fine.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.184
But I'm moving her bed away
from the window.

09:53.185 --> 09:54.353
Okay.

09:54.354 --> 09:55.898
Give me ten minutes.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.485
Uh-huh.

10:14.687 --> 10:17.065
Salvation is at our door.

10:17.066 --> 10:19.486
Did the Mormons leave
more shame packets?

10:19.487 --> 10:22.034
No, it's my mum's battenberg cake.

10:22.035 --> 10:25.165
Oh, yes!

10:25.166 --> 10:26.960
You know, it's her way of guilting us

10:26.961 --> 10:28.379
for not inviting her to Christmas.

10:28.380 --> 10:30.051
Ooh, best of both worlds.

10:31.261 --> 10:33.222
- Wow.
- Let's have a look.

10:33.223 --> 10:35.060
- Are you ready?
- This is the moment.

10:35.061 --> 10:36.855
Boom.

10:36.856 --> 10:38.483
- Wow.
- Wait. Hold on.

10:38.484 --> 10:39.861
- Yorkie.
- Marmite.

10:39.862 --> 10:41.114
Got to have some Marmite.

10:42.785 --> 10:44.662
Tea cakes.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.010
Where is it?

10:52.011 --> 10:53.806
"In the interest of national security,

10:53.807 --> 10:55.601
"certain items may have been removed

10:55.602 --> 10:58.857
by U. S. Customs and Border Protection."

10:58.858 --> 11:01.196
National security?

11:03.117 --> 11:04.662
They stole my battenberg.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.963
Rae is a saint.
You are aware of this, yes?

11:09.964 --> 11:12.300
She mentions it on occasion.

11:12.301 --> 11:14.304
How she functions
in your crazy system...

11:14.305 --> 11:16.726
No, it's not a crazy system.

11:16.727 --> 11:18.981
Rae and I are sexually
incompatible co-parents

11:18.982 --> 11:22.822
who mostly but non-exclusively
love each other.

11:22.823 --> 11:24.909
What other system would we use?

11:24.910 --> 11:27.915
Marriage. What you've just
described is marriage.

11:27.916 --> 11:29.669
Sure, but instead of emotional affairs

11:29.670 --> 11:31.798
and internet porn, we get to
sleep with other people

11:31.799 --> 11:34.136
without fear of litigation

11:34.137 --> 11:36.725
and then have breakfast
with our daughter.

11:36.726 --> 11:37.935
- Okay.
- It works.

11:37.936 --> 11:39.438
I said okay.

11:39.439 --> 11:40.941
How are you?

11:40.942 --> 11:42.528
I'm dreaming in Kubrick,

11:42.529 --> 11:44.198
and I haven't seen my daughter
in two years.

11:44.199 --> 11:47.663
Other than that, just fine.

11:47.664 --> 11:49.249
That's the spirit.

11:54.177 --> 11:55.847
Oh, I think it's your mummy.

11:57.559 --> 11:58.603
Hey.

12:00.481 --> 12:01.942
Wow. Your hair.

12:01.943 --> 12:04.196
- Oh, it's short.
- It's so short.

12:04.197 --> 12:06.033
- I mean, I love it.
- Okay.

12:06.034 --> 12:07.787
It's great. I think it's so great.

12:07.788 --> 12:09.624
It's great.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.001
Hi.

12:11.002 --> 12:12.838
- Valerie.
- Are you Tathiana?

12:12.839 --> 12:14.341
- Yes, oh, my God.
- Hi... okay.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.803
You hear so much about someone,

12:15.804 --> 12:18.057
and they're never
like you expect, but...

12:18.058 --> 12:19.351
you're so beautiful.

12:19.352 --> 12:20.980
I can't wait to dress you.

12:20.981 --> 12:22.107
- To dress me?
- Yeah.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.317
Leave her be, Tati.

12:23.318 --> 12:24.946
Oh, okay. Um, come here.

12:24.947 --> 12:26.909
Over here. Sit with me.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.419
- You.
- Now don't get sentimental.

12:34.173 --> 12:35.968
Oh, Jesus.

12:35.969 --> 12:37.429
You are fit.

12:37.430 --> 12:38.974
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.270
No, it wasn't a compliment. It's weird.

12:41.271 --> 12:45.988
You should eat some pasta
and embrace your obsolescence.

12:45.989 --> 12:48.994
Nice seeing you too.

12:48.995 --> 12:50.496
- Father.
- Daughter.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.377
Oh. Did you miss me?

12:53.378 --> 12:55.048
You totally missed me.

12:55.049 --> 12:57.344
I have, on occasion,
considered your existence.

12:57.345 --> 13:00.016
I knew it. Come on, meet Tathiana.

13:00.017 --> 13:01.728
And then, there were, like,
these streets,

13:01.729 --> 13:03.774
and we were completely lost,
and you were so mad at me

13:03.775 --> 13:04.817
'cause you were so sunburned.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.153
I was so miserable.

13:06.154 --> 13:07.573
But then we hear these voices,

13:07.574 --> 13:09.451
in, like, this alley, and we go in it,

13:09.452 --> 13:11.706
and we realize there's, like,
and amazing concert playing.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.334
It was so great.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.841
Oh, wow. They found
Scott Pruitt in Ukraine.

13:16.842 --> 13:17.968
- Remember him?
- Yeah.

13:17.969 --> 13:19.972
Shot 14 times in the street.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.227
No way.

13:22.228 --> 13:23.396
Hmm.

13:23.397 --> 13:25.024
You ever been to Ukraine?

13:25.025 --> 13:27.320
Nah, their advertising
hasn't reached me.

13:28.365 --> 13:30.994
So how did you two meet?

13:30.995 --> 13:32.497
I just... I feel like, I don't know,

13:32.498 --> 13:33.750
I... I don't know.

13:33.751 --> 13:35.420
Uh, well...

13:35.421 --> 13:36.798
I seduced her.

13:36.799 --> 13:37.883
- You did, didn't you?
- Mm-hmm.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.219
- Oh.
- I'd see her

13:39.220 --> 13:41.098
out back of my apartment every night,

13:41.099 --> 13:44.396
and one time she looked sad,

13:44.397 --> 13:46.108
and I was maybe a little bit tipsy.

13:46.109 --> 13:48.780
- You were very drunk.
- I was very drunk.

13:48.781 --> 13:50.450
Then she came down and talked to me

13:50.451 --> 13:52.913
when I was feeling particularly lonely.

13:52.914 --> 13:55.669
And we drank some wine and talked,

13:55.670 --> 13:58.132
- and drank some more wine.
- Mm-hmm.

13:58.133 --> 14:00.512
And then it was the morning.

14:00.513 --> 14:03.434
And I felt like I had known her
for a really long time.

14:03.435 --> 14:04.687
Yeah.

14:04.688 --> 14:06.356
And I was sick of Spain,

14:06.357 --> 14:08.360
and she was gonna be in LA for school.

14:08.361 --> 14:10.281
- So...
- And voilà.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.745
She quit her job, and off we went.

14:12.746 --> 14:14.957
Porto, Morocco, Tunisia.

14:14.958 --> 14:16.544
Where we ran out of money.

14:16.545 --> 14:18.380
- We were so broke.
- Yeah.

14:18.381 --> 14:19.382
But we made it.

14:19.383 --> 14:21.053
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:22.641 --> 14:24.017
Wow.

14:24.018 --> 14:25.646
That sounds amazing.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.898
- That's really...
- It's been...

14:26.899 --> 14:30.404
- It was.
- Quite a journey.

14:30.405 --> 14:32.535
So now that you're back,

14:32.536 --> 14:34.037
now what's the plan?

14:34.038 --> 14:36.208
Uh, well, I'm just working right now

14:36.209 --> 14:37.711
at a job in a kitchen.

14:37.712 --> 14:40.091
- Like a restaurant kitchen?
- Yeah.

14:40.092 --> 14:41.845
Oh. You didn't like to cook before.

14:41.846 --> 14:44.099
Before...

14:44.100 --> 14:46.771
was a long time ago.

14:46.772 --> 14:49.569
I mean, I'm sure your life
is different now too.

14:49.570 --> 14:51.280
Mm.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.409
Leeza, you got two on your left.

14:53.410 --> 14:55.454
Rod, I'm down on health.
I'm conjuring a spell.

15:10.402 --> 15:12.405
Yeah, I mean, I...

15:12.406 --> 15:14.577
tried a lot of things.

15:14.578 --> 15:16.748
That... I... it was a period
of exploration.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.421
Um, but I'm happy where I ended up.

15:20.422 --> 15:21.758
You know.

15:21.759 --> 15:23.427
I mean, the house is still the same,

15:23.428 --> 15:26.224
and so is work, but uh,

15:26.225 --> 15:27.978
that's just me, I guess.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.778
That's great.

15:31.779 --> 15:33.740
- Well, cheers.
- Salud.

15:33.741 --> 15:34.909
Ah, salud.

15:34.910 --> 15:36.956
Cheers.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.549
- And this is...
- Chef's puree.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.680
Legume and spice. Enjoy.

15:46.140 --> 15:48.143
You write all that down?

15:48.144 --> 15:50.649
Maybe they want us to eat it
and then guess what it is.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.903
Well, I'm allergic
to over 300 plants and spices,

15:52.904 --> 15:54.030
so don't get too comfortable.

15:54.031 --> 15:55.199
Oh, cool, I've never ridden

15:55.200 --> 15:56.703
in an ambulance before.

15:56.704 --> 15:58.205
Oh, no, I can't afford an ambulance,

15:58.206 --> 16:00.544
but we can split an Uber
if you make the request.

16:00.545 --> 16:02.422
Done.

16:02.423 --> 16:03.550
I'm Kendall, by the way.

16:03.551 --> 16:05.721
Hey, Kendall. Alex.

16:05.722 --> 16:06.806
- You first.
- Really?

16:06.807 --> 16:07.921
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

16:10.474 --> 16:12.804
No, but how is it a security risk?

16:12.997 --> 16:15.953
I mean, it's not a cake
with a file baked into it.

16:16.744 --> 16:18.964
Also, I'm not in prison, so...

16:18.998 --> 16:21.794
even if it were a cake
with a file baked into it,

16:21.795 --> 16:23.730
it would be perfectly legal.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.552
No, I do not want to log a complaint

16:25.553 --> 16:27.691
into the online system.

16:27.766 --> 16:30.102
To be honest, I wish you
were an online system.

16:30.103 --> 16:33.777
That way, I wouldn't feel
guilty about berating you.

16:33.778 --> 16:37.200
No, no, I do not want to be transferred.

16:37.201 --> 16:39.956
No, no, I want my fucking battenberg!

16:44.381 --> 16:46.886
Oh, fuck, now they're playing music.

16:46.887 --> 16:48.890
"Für Elise."

16:48.891 --> 16:50.309
And that's German.

16:53.358 --> 16:57.240
I'll take this whenever you're ready.

16:57.241 --> 17:00.580
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:00.581 --> 17:03.670
- You were staring.
- Was I?

17:03.671 --> 17:05.256
She's happy, healthy, and employed.

17:05.257 --> 17:08.053
Think of the 10,000 other
outcomes and be grateful.

17:08.054 --> 17:09.974
- I am.
- I am too.

17:11.603 --> 17:12.980
So how are you? How have you been?

17:12.981 --> 17:14.692
Oh, you know,

17:14.693 --> 17:17.195
too old for a midlife crisis,
too young to retire,

17:17.196 --> 17:18.700
and too sane to jump off a bridge

17:18.701 --> 17:20.704
to see what happens next.

17:20.704 --> 17:23.502
Oh, well, then, I guess
text me when you're ready.

17:25.005 --> 17:27.215
I could use the change of scenery.

17:27.217 --> 17:28.803
You sound like your brother.

17:28.804 --> 17:31.057
That's the scary thing, though, right?

17:31.058 --> 17:32.059
You're minding your own business,

17:32.060 --> 17:33.478
and then suddenly...

17:33.479 --> 17:35.149
shunk, run through with a palm front.

17:35.150 --> 17:36.569
No, totally.

17:36.570 --> 17:38.573
It just all feels so random, though.

17:38.574 --> 17:39.950
It's like, for all we know,
God's just some

17:39.951 --> 17:41.328
M. Night Shyamalan asshole

17:41.329 --> 17:42.496
who's, like, pulling strings

17:42.497 --> 17:44.042
chaotically and nonsensically.

17:44.043 --> 17:46.421
Oh, no, is God a tasteless hack

17:46.422 --> 17:47.423
who likes cheap thrills?

17:47.424 --> 17:49.135
That's reassuring.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.306
But, like, the palm frond's
just the tip, right?

17:51.307 --> 17:53.101
'Cause the big one's coming.

17:53.102 --> 17:55.481
Like that earthquake that just
splits the world in half.

17:55.482 --> 17:57.235
I mean, it's... it's LA.

17:57.236 --> 17:58.445
It's only a matter of time.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.038
Yeah, well,
that's why we have the moments.

18:03.039 --> 18:05.376
Real connection is difficult
and precious,

18:05.377 --> 18:07.923
and like, what the fuck else do
we have in this world, right?

18:07.924 --> 18:12.056
It's like, you meet someone,
and you just never let them go.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.726
You just never stop loving them

18:13.727 --> 18:15.397
until you're both six feet under.

18:16.984 --> 18:18.779
Wow. Yeah.

18:19.990 --> 18:21.952
You think Home Depot is still open?

18:28.632 --> 18:31.345
- Is, like, five enough?
- Yeah, five, ten.

18:32.431 --> 18:34.893
Oh, hey, um, we're gonna go grab drinks,

18:34.894 --> 18:36.229
if you wanted to join us?

18:36.230 --> 18:38.569
No thanks. I'm gonna take a pass.

18:39.821 --> 18:41.197
I like her.

18:41.198 --> 18:42.535
Me too.

18:44.622 --> 18:46.667
Yeah, guess I'm gonna head out as well,

18:46.668 --> 18:47.669
but we'll catch up soon.

18:47.670 --> 18:48.963
Sure. Yeah.

18:48.964 --> 18:50.925
It was really nice seeing you, Mom.

18:50.926 --> 18:53.013
And thank you, again, for dinner.

18:53.014 --> 18:54.307
- My God.
- Oh...

18:54.308 --> 18:56.729
Um, if you want...

18:56.730 --> 18:58.315
and I'm sure you have a place to stay,

18:58.316 --> 19:01.071
but you know,
your bedroom's always open,

19:01.072 --> 19:03.116
and I have a laundry machine.

19:03.117 --> 19:05.371
I know. And a dryer too.

19:07.417 --> 19:10.130
But seriously, you're good?

19:10.131 --> 19:11.842
I am good, yeah.

19:11.843 --> 19:12.844
Okay.

19:12.845 --> 19:14.848
Well...

19:14.849 --> 19:16.226
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.

19:16.227 --> 19:19.149
I am so happy you're home.

19:20.276 --> 19:22.280
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

19:34.012 --> 19:36.141
Hey, Rae?

19:36.142 --> 19:38.604
I'm starting an earthquake kit.

19:38.605 --> 19:40.900
I was thinking...

19:40.901 --> 19:43.990
calamity could strike at any moment,

19:43.991 --> 19:46.077
and we need to be prepared.

19:46.078 --> 19:48.416
Also, have I mentioned recently
that I love you?

19:49.627 --> 19:50.754
Hi.

19:52.550 --> 19:55.220
- Hi.
- I'm Jeff.

19:55.221 --> 19:57.266
- Jeff.
- Uh-huh. Rae's boyfriend.

19:57.267 --> 20:00.189
- Oh.
- Hey, guys.

20:00.190 --> 20:02.986
- How was dinner?
- Good.

20:02.987 --> 20:05.032
What is this?

20:05.033 --> 20:06.744
Earthquake kit. Can we talk?

20:06.745 --> 20:08.789
Uh, yeah.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.544
I'll be back.

20:15.094 --> 20:16.972
Hello, Valerie.

20:16.973 --> 20:19.185
If you'd like to connect
your phone to music,

20:19.186 --> 20:20.731
please turn on Bluetooth now.

20:23.779 --> 20:25.658
Hello.

20:27.369 --> 20:28.829
Is that you?

20:32.588 --> 20:37.639
Hey, I do not masturbate in the dark.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.476
It's called mood lighting.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.611
And...

20:44.612 --> 20:48.368
I'm ready for that secret now, so...

20:48.369 --> 20:51.165
whenever you're ready,
just lay it on me,

20:51.166 --> 20:55.758
'cause happiness...

20:55.759 --> 20:57.637
here I come.

20:57.638 --> 20:59.348
No Bluetooth detected.

20:59.349 --> 21:02.187
You will arrive at your
destination in 14 minutes.

21:15.425 --> 21:16.926
Sonja?

21:23.189 --> 21:24.692
Sonja?

21:26.571 --> 21:28.533
What are you doing?

21:32.123 --> 21:34.460
- Hi, Rita.
- Hi, Val.

21:36.508 --> 21:38.385
Whatcha doing?

21:38.386 --> 21:40.723
- I'm breaking in.
- Okay.

21:40.724 --> 21:43.144
I mean, it's animal abuse,
what she's doing.

21:43.145 --> 21:45.692
Well, that may be, but...

21:45.693 --> 21:47.361
someone's gonna call the cops.

21:47.362 --> 21:49.658
I mean, doubt it. They know us.

21:49.659 --> 21:51.327
Can you not say "us"?

21:51.328 --> 21:53.373
'Cause I'm kind of having a night,

21:53.374 --> 21:58.843
and, uh, don't really want to
get embroiled in all this.

21:58.844 --> 22:00.763
Also, Rita, she's an old woman.

22:00.764 --> 22:02.266
Maybe she wants to hide away.

22:02.267 --> 22:03.686
Can you just let her be?

22:03.687 --> 22:04.981
No.

22:06.568 --> 22:07.986
Oh, shit. Hey, oh!

22:07.987 --> 22:10.240
Sonja?

22:10.241 --> 22:11.827
Come on, puppy, puppy, puppy,
puppy, puppy!

22:11.828 --> 22:14.166
Sonja, your dog just ran out.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.396
I'm not comfortable with that.

22:18.498 --> 22:20.417
Too bad.

22:20.512 --> 22:22.181
- Too bad?
- Yeah.

22:22.182 --> 22:23.684
I don't want our daughter being exposed

22:23.685 --> 22:25.646
to the people we sleep with, okay?

22:25.647 --> 22:27.859
My parents did that,
and look how I turned out.

22:27.860 --> 22:29.654
Who even is this guy?

22:29.655 --> 22:30.866
Jeff.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.286
- Jeff.
- Jeff?

22:33.287 --> 22:34.623
There's a billion people named Jeff.

22:34.624 --> 22:36.125
- J...
- Jeff?

22:36.126 --> 22:37.796
I've been dating him since, like, July.

22:37.797 --> 22:38.964
- No.
- I told you about him.

22:38.965 --> 22:40.217
No, you did not.

22:40.218 --> 22:42.179
Do you seriously not remember?

22:43.975 --> 22:46.730
Jeff made this for me.

22:46.731 --> 22:47.899
That's fun.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.151
Jeff wants Thai.

22:49.152 --> 22:50.863
What's that spot you like again?

22:50.864 --> 22:52.157
- Jitlada.
- Ah.

22:52.158 --> 22:54.078
- Pick me up a crab rice.
- Okay.

22:54.079 --> 22:57.209
I think Jeff and I might go
to Santa Barbara this weekend.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.461
Should I shave my beard?

22:58.462 --> 22:59.589
Jeff. Jeff.

22:59.590 --> 23:02.052
Jeff. Jeff. Jeff.

23:02.053 --> 23:03.054
I don't... it sounds vaguely familiar.

23:03.055 --> 23:04.558
Okay, whatever.

23:04.559 --> 23:06.728
I... we agreed to date
other people, all right?

23:06.729 --> 23:09.943
I like this guy, and I want him
to be in my life,

23:09.944 --> 23:13.449
and yeah, I want him to be
in my daughter's life, and...

23:13.450 --> 23:15.913
Look, I am not your mom,
and Jeff is cool,

23:15.914 --> 23:18.878
and if you're not comfortable
with that, then...

23:18.879 --> 23:20.965
Yeah. I don't know.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.886
Maybe... maybe we need to have
a larger conversation.

23:22.887 --> 23:24.598
Oh, come on with that.

23:24.599 --> 23:27.227
I'm not doing this right now, all right?

23:27.228 --> 23:29.148
Our daughter. Our daughter's life.

23:29.149 --> 23:30.776
- Sorry, our daughter.
- Yeah, that's correct.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.862
- Our daughter.
- Thank you.

23:43.970 --> 23:47.309
Sonja? We're in your living room.

23:47.310 --> 23:48.478
Don't be scared.

23:48.479 --> 23:49.480
Okay, what are we doing?

23:49.481 --> 23:51.067
This is... she's not here.

23:51.068 --> 23:52.779
Of course she's here.
Where would she be?

23:52.780 --> 23:55.660
I don't know, maybe she's...
with her lover.

23:55.661 --> 23:56.662
Sonja!

23:56.663 --> 23:57.997
She doesn't have a lover.

23:57.998 --> 23:59.416
Look at that stack of magazines.

23:59.417 --> 24:02.172
Well, maybe she's just an avid reader.

24:02.173 --> 24:04.176
Reading is, you know, a lost art.

24:04.177 --> 24:07.474
Oh, my God. Look at all the doilies.

24:07.475 --> 24:09.813
Sonja?

24:16.451 --> 24:18.205
Oh, my God.

24:24.134 --> 24:26.470
What's the matter, baby?

24:26.471 --> 24:30.437
I just feel a little bit more
insignificant than usual.

24:30.438 --> 24:32.985
You're not insignificant to me.

24:36.868 --> 24:40.708
Why is it that the jobs
that tax our souls

24:40.709 --> 24:42.252
pay the best?

24:43.464 --> 24:45.341
We'll make it work.

24:45.342 --> 24:46.762
That's why we're here, right?

24:46.763 --> 24:48.057
Hopes and dreams.

24:50.269 --> 24:52.857
I'm sorry about your battenberg.

24:52.858 --> 24:55.654
I will buy you an éclair tomorrow.

24:55.655 --> 24:57.867
That's an inferior French pastry.

24:57.868 --> 25:00.498
Oh, hush.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.589
My family is crazy.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.969
I was expecting way worse.

25:08.765 --> 25:11.771
- Did I do all right?
- You were your lovely self.

25:13.733 --> 25:16.613
It's weird to be back.

25:16.614 --> 25:21.915
I feel like at any moment,
I might scream or cry.

25:21.916 --> 25:23.585
I like the screaming.

25:23.586 --> 25:26.634
Not so much the crying.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.516
Thank you for being there.

25:30.517 --> 25:31.810
Of course.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.028
Mikel is having a party.

25:37.029 --> 25:38.406
- We should totally go.
- Now?

25:38.407 --> 25:41.120
Yeah, it'll be fun.

25:41.121 --> 25:43.959
I would, but I have work tomorrow.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.671
- But you should go.
- You sure?

25:45.672 --> 25:47.341
Yeah, yeah.

25:49.763 --> 25:51.474
Okay, um, I'm gonna go change.

26:08.885 --> 26:10.846
That's not even funny.

26:16.984 --> 26:19.071
Okay, it's funny.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.505
Hey.

26:27.506 --> 26:30.886
Hi, Daddy.

26:30.887 --> 26:32.975
Whatcha doing?

26:34.979 --> 26:37.984
- You can stay with me tonight.
- Okay.

26:37.985 --> 26:39.821
Come here.

26:39.822 --> 26:42.450
Ooh.

26:42.451 --> 26:44.329
Let's bring this guy.
