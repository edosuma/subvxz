00:40.051 --> 00:42.123
It's him.

00:50.658 --> 00:51.692
Damn it.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.097
(over headset): I couldn't get off a shot.

00:54.165 --> 00:55.868
Stand by.

00:55.936 --> 00:57.839
We'll get him on the way out.

01:16.626 --> 01:18.627
Manuel!

01:21.799 --> 01:23.801
Hey, Manny!

01:26.705 --> 01:28.707
Manny!

01:29.709 --> 01:31.711
(water running)

01:34.482 --> 01:37.850
Hey, Manny!

01:56.244 --> 01:58.613
(line ringing)

01:58.681 --> 01:59.614
WOMAN: Yes?

01:59.682 --> 02:00.749
Put Mauricio on the phone.

02:00.817 --> 02:02.819
Victor? Just put Mauricio on!

02:02.887 --> 02:03.921
He's dead.

02:03.988 --> 02:05.356
What?

02:05.424 --> 02:07.092
Someone shot him in the head.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.761
What the hell is happening?

02:30.122 --> 02:31.489
I see him.

02:31.557 --> 02:33.024
He's leaving the building.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.493
I'set.

02:42.030 --> 02:43.196
Stop.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.463
SPOTTER: It's not him.

02:45.531 --> 02:48.766
He can't be far.

02:59.208 --> 03:00.775
(grunts)

03:02.978 --> 03:05.379
(engine starts)

03:07.516 --> 03:10.484
(tires squealing)

03:12.387 --> 03:13.988
Coming at you! Gray sedan!

03:18.427 --> 03:20.328
(tires squealing)

03:38.548 --> 03:40.483
Target is out of range.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.550
Move out.

03:47.588 --> 03:48.721
(panting)

03:48.788 --> 03:49.989
OPERATOR: 911. What's your emergency?

03:50.056 --> 03:53.291
Yes. I want to report a stolen vehicle.

03:53.358 --> 03:59.061
License plate SNE15C5.

03:59.129 --> 04:01.130
(upbeat music plays on TV)

04:06.936 --> 04:07.936
Jack?

04:12.708 --> 04:14.175
Oh.

04:14.243 --> 04:17.378
Sweetheart, we already
talked about this, remember?

04:17.446 --> 04:19.046
You're supposed to call me "Grandpa."

04:19.113 --> 04:21.748
You don't look like a grandpa.

04:21.815 --> 04:23.383
(chuckling)

04:23.451 --> 04:24.851
Couldn't agree with you more.

04:24.919 --> 04:27.687
The cartoon I turned on is boring.

04:27.755 --> 04:29.756
Okay. We'll find another one.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.728
This is the boldest diplomatic initiative

04:34.795 --> 04:36.262
we've seen in a generation.

04:36.330 --> 04:38.731
It could finally lay a
foundation for real peace

04:38.799 --> 04:40.366
throughout the entire region.

04:40.433 --> 04:41.901
Well, you know, Bob, the president's

04:41.968 --> 04:43.169
certainly betting her legacy

04:43.237 --> 04:44.904
on the success of these negotiations...

04:44.972 --> 04:46.573
Grandpa!

04:46.640 --> 04:48.375
This isn't a cartoon!

04:48.442 --> 04:49.609
Okay, okay.

04:51.446 --> 04:52.612
*A sloth of bears... âTª

04:52.680 --> 04:54.345
This one! I like this one!

04:54.413 --> 04:57.111
*A mob of cows âTª

04:57.179 --> 04:58.212
*A herd of sheep... âTª

04:58.280 --> 05:01.914
(making funny sounds)

05:01.981 --> 05:03.715
(phone rings)

05:05.117 --> 05:06.250
Yeah?

05:06.318 --> 05:08.185
Hi, Dad. Sorry we're late.

05:08.253 --> 05:09.586
They're redirecting everyone around the UN.

05:09.654 --> 05:11.088
It's all right. We're doing fine.

05:11.155 --> 05:12.389
How was the zoo?

05:12.456 --> 05:13.790
Well, to be honest with you,

05:13.857 --> 05:15.591
we spent most of our time
just going back and forth

05:15.659 --> 05:17.426
between the black bears and the polar bears.

05:17.494 --> 05:19.962
I forgot to mention that she's
going through a bear pha.

05:21.331 --> 05:22.764
Well, she certainly knows what she wants.

05:24.299 --> 05:25.533
She reminds me of you.

05:25.601 --> 05:26.900
Well, that's funny.

05:26.968 --> 05:29.169
I always tell Stephen how
much she reminds me of you.

05:29.237 --> 05:31.371
Anyway, we'll be there in a few minutes.

05:31.438 --> 05:32.538
Okay. Don't worry.

05:32.606 --> 05:34.073
We'll meet you in the lobby.

05:34.140 --> 05:35.841
Great.

05:35.909 --> 05:38.143
Sounds like they had fun.

05:38.211 --> 05:40.812
They always do.

05:40.879 --> 05:42.713
What's wrong?

05:42.780 --> 05:46.082
We talked to him about moving
to LA the night we got here.

05:46.150 --> 05:48.083
Yeah. He said he'd think about it.

05:48.151 --> 05:49.684
Yeah, and he hasn't mentioned
one word about it since.

05:49.752 --> 05:50.952
And we leave tonight.

05:51.019 --> 05:52.920
Well, maybe he has to
check with his doctors.

05:52.987 --> 05:54.621
No, they cleared him two weeks ag

05:54.689 --> 05:56.722
He's finished with treatme.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.223
I don't know.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.125
My father has been on his own for so long.

06:01.193 --> 06:03.327
Maybe he doesn't know how
to live any other way.

06:03.394 --> 06:04.827
Why don't you just ask him again?

06:04.895 --> 06:09.064
My father is not the type
of person you ask twice.

06:09.131 --> 06:10.931
If you want, I can do it.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.170
<i>REPORTER: Here at e ited Nions,</i>

06:19.238 --> 06:21.772
<i>a White House spokesman just confirmed that
Presiden</i>

06:21.840 --> 06:24.140
Taylor and Hassan will be
hoing a joint press conference

06:24.208 --> 06:25.541
later this hour.

06:25.609 --> 06:28.444
It is widely expected that
President Hassan will announce

06:28.511 --> 06:30.779
the dismantling of his country's
nuclear weapons program.

06:30.847 --> 06:34.818
esident Hassan has stated that
he conside these negotiations

06:34.885 --> 06:38.823
a historic success and a new
beginning for his country

06:38.891 --> 06:40.592
and the entire Mideast region.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.997
I believe that that is a
reasonable compromise.

06:44.065 --> 06:47.768
Now, Mr. President, let's move
on to the issue of verification.

06:47.835 --> 06:51.906
Now, the language in your
latest proposal is vague.

06:51.974 --> 06:53.808
Let me be clear.

06:53.876 --> 06:55.443
My country agrees

06:55.510 --> 06:58.111
to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons

06:58.179 --> 07:02.047
with full International Atomic
Energy Agency safeguards.

07:02.115 --> 07:04.382
But our terms, Mr. President,

07:04.450 --> 07:07.284
were that the inspectors
themselves would be American,

07:07.352 --> 07:08.752
not IAEA.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.318
With respect, Madam President,

07:10.386 --> 07:12.851
your side pushed the point,
but we never conceded.

07:12.919 --> 07:16.854
With respect, your side
has refused to negotiate

07:16.922 --> 07:18.789
the point in good faith.

07:18.857 --> 07:20.190
Without Americans on the ground--

07:20.258 --> 07:21.991
Surely, we're not going
to let the nationality

07:22.059 --> 07:23.125
of a few hundred men--

07:23.193 --> 07:24.793
...verification has no teeth.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.462
So, only the United States can
be trusted, Mr. Secretary?

07:27.530 --> 07:30.698
This is the message that you
sent to the rest of the world

07:30.766 --> 07:31.999
and then you wonder why we
don't want to negotiate.

07:32.067 --> 07:34.535
Farhad.

07:34.603 --> 07:36.470
Madam President,

07:36.538 --> 07:38.071
please excuse my brother's passion.

07:38.139 --> 07:40.207
He only wants what is best for our country.

07:40.274 --> 07:41.910
I understand.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.712
But we need to resolve this issue

07:43.779 --> 07:44.912
before we can move forward.

07:44.980 --> 07:47.080
And ideally, before

07:47.148 --> 07:49.516
the press conference, which gives us

07:49.584 --> 07:50.885
less than an hour.

07:50.952 --> 07:52.386
HASSAN: Madame President...

07:53.856 --> 07:55.524
what would your Congress say

07:55.591 --> 07:57.492
if my Revolutionary Guard

07:57.560 --> 07:59.561
was stationed on your soil?

08:01.963 --> 08:03.330
It's the same with my

08:03.398 --> 08:05.232
National Assembly.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.268
Even if I agreed to this,
they would not ratify it.

08:09.937 --> 08:11.337
After all, I'm not a king.

08:11.405 --> 08:13.105
Nor I a queen.

08:13.173 --> 08:15.907
Too bad for both of us.

08:18.477 --> 08:19.944
I'd like to adjourn

08:20.011 --> 08:22.445
and discuss this issue
with our respective teams.

08:22.513 --> 08:24.013
Of course.

08:36.322 --> 08:38.556
You are aware he was a salesman
before entering politics.

08:38.624 --> 08:40.691
Household appliances.

08:40.759 --> 08:44.327
You want to bet he sold
a lot of refrigerators?

08:46.430 --> 08:48.730
Find a way to give him what he wants.

08:48.798 --> 08:50.765
Madam President...

08:50.833 --> 08:52.133
You heard me.

08:52.201 --> 08:54.570
Try to make the inspections work.

08:56.007 --> 08:57.975
This man is a once in a lifetime leader.

08:58.043 --> 08:59.276
And he has already

08:59.344 --> 09:01.847
suspended his support for
terrorist organizations,

09:01.915 --> 09:03.549
and privately, he's advocating

09:03.617 --> 09:05.250
for a two-state solution.

09:05.318 --> 09:08.019
How much further can we expect
him to stick his neck out?

09:19.696 --> 09:21.697
(elevator bell dings)

09:25.301 --> 09:27.669
Hey, come here.

09:27.737 --> 09:28.770
Did you name him yet? Bear.

09:28.838 --> 09:30.305
"Bear." KIM: There she is.

09:30.372 --> 09:32.607
Go get your mom. Hi!

09:32.674 --> 09:33.807
(laughing)

09:33.875 --> 09:36.677
Hey! I heard that you

09:36.744 --> 09:39.246
and Grandpa were hanging out with the bears.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.414
Then we had ice cream,

09:41.482 --> 09:43.349
but I didn't like mine, so Grandpa

09:43.417 --> 09:45.584
gave me his.

09:45.652 --> 09:46.785
That's nice. STEPHEN: Here, I got her.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.620
Thanks for watching her, Jack. Of course.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.523
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about

09:52.591 --> 09:54.491
what we talked about.

09:54.559 --> 09:56.059
And I've made up my mind.

09:56.127 --> 09:58.194
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you.

09:58.262 --> 10:00.196
Really? Yeah.

10:00.264 --> 10:02.231
I got a friend who's got
a private security firm.

10:02.299 --> 10:03.532
Said he'd give me some consulting work.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.966
He's also got a place I can rent.

10:05.034 --> 10:06.535
Dad, I don't know what to say.

10:06.602 --> 10:08.503
Come here.

10:09.838 --> 10:10.971
You don't have to say anything.

10:11.039 --> 10:12.473
Just give me a ride to the airport tonight.

10:12.540 --> 10:13.807
Wait, you're coming with us tonight?

10:13.875 --> 10:15.141
If it's okay.

10:15.209 --> 10:16.309
Of course. Stephen.

10:16.377 --> 10:18.210
Yeah? He's coming with us tonight.

10:18.278 --> 10:19.845
And I've just got a few more things to pack.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.680
I don't have very much.
I can be at your hotel in about an hour.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.283
That's perfect. We can get back
and finish packing ourselves.

10:24.350 --> 10:25.684
It'll be all right if I fly back

10:25.751 --> 10:26.685
to Los Angeles with you?

10:26.752 --> 10:29.687
Yay! Yay!

10:29.754 --> 10:31.321
Come on. I'll walk you to the car.

10:31.389 --> 10:33.389
Okay. Let's go.

10:36.959 --> 10:38.359
Yay! I got her.

10:38.426 --> 10:41.428
Okay. *We're going in the car. âTª

10:48.167 --> 10:50.468
Get your belt done up...

10:54.303 --> 10:56.405
Dad, I am so glad that you're doing this.

10:56.473 --> 10:57.606
Me, too.

10:57.674 --> 10:59.942
I love you. Love you.

11:00.010 --> 11:01.377
Okay, guys, I'll see you in an hour.

11:01.445 --> 11:03.313
TERI: Okay. Bye, sweetheart.

11:03.381 --> 11:04.414
TERI: Bye!

11:13.593 --> 11:15.394
(gasps, groans)

11:35.869 --> 11:37.436
Good afternoon, everyone.

11:37.504 --> 11:39.371
Good afternoon.

11:39.439 --> 11:42.308
All right, just a few things
before we get started here.

11:42.376 --> 11:44.977
Presidents Taylor and Hassan
will each make a statement

11:45.045 --> 11:46.112
after they've been introduced

11:46.179 --> 11:47.146
by the Secretary-General.

11:47.214 --> 11:48.481
The Q&A will follow,

11:48.549 --> 11:50.749
but I want you to keep your
questions strictly on topic.

11:50.816 --> 11:52.183
For obvious reasons, we're all operating

11:52.250 --> 11:53.750
under heightened security measures,

11:53.818 --> 11:55.885
so, unless you've been dying to know

11:55.953 --> 11:57.320
what a chokehold feels like,

11:57.387 --> 11:59.121
keep your credentials visible at all times.

11:59.189 --> 12:00.488
All right?

12:00.556 --> 12:01.723
That's all for now.

12:01.790 --> 12:03.891
(reporters murmuring)

12:07.329 --> 12:10.665
Meredith Reed, press.

12:10.733 --> 12:12.133
It's invalid.

12:12.201 --> 12:14.069
What?

12:14.136 --> 12:16.271
It can't be invalid.

12:16.339 --> 12:17.606
Can you double check?

12:17.673 --> 12:20.540
I did, ma'am. Your credentials
have been revoked.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.274
Revoked by whom?

12:22.341 --> 12:23.842
I don't have that information.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.011
Okay, this has to be some sort of mistake.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.012
You do remember me.
I've been here every day.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.648
Please step aside, ma'am.

12:41.090 --> 12:43.457
I just talked to Secretary of State Kanin.

12:43.525 --> 12:46.859
He's agreed to IAEAnspectors.

12:46.927 --> 12:48.493
That's good news.

12:48.561 --> 12:50.325
There is a condition attached.

12:50.393 --> 12:51.760
They're insisting

12:51.828 --> 12:53.995
that the head of the
verification team be an American.

12:56.698 --> 12:58.465
I think we can live with that, don't you?

12:58.533 --> 13:00.100
You know where I stand.

13:00.168 --> 13:02.803
We've already surrendered too
much in the name of peace.

13:02.870 --> 13:05.705
Surrender is a strong word, Farhad.

13:05.772 --> 13:08.407
And what have we surrendered really,

13:08.474 --> 13:10.475
apart from our nuclear ambition?

13:10.543 --> 13:12.276
Isn't that enough?

13:12.344 --> 13:14.244
Spinning 6,000 centrifuges

13:14.312 --> 13:15.846
is good for political maneuvering,

13:15.914 --> 13:18.281
but it's helping to bankrupt our country.

13:18.349 --> 13:20.050
The truth is,

13:20.117 --> 13:22.118
we are not the ones being so generous.

13:22.186 --> 13:25.020
President Taylor is lifting
economic sanctions,

13:25.088 --> 13:27.623
and offering an aid package
worth billions of dollars.

13:27.690 --> 13:29.524
We got everything we wanted, Farhad.

13:29.592 --> 13:31.693
As long as it's not a trick.

13:31.761 --> 13:34.062
(phone ringing)

13:35.897 --> 13:37.831
Hello.

13:37.899 --> 13:42.669
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
with something so mundane,

13:42.737 --> 13:45.672
but I'm stuck outside.

13:45.740 --> 13:47.074
Stuck?

13:47.141 --> 13:48.739
My press credentials

13:48.806 --> 13:51.507
have been revoked.

13:51.575 --> 13:52.741
I dI'll take care of it.

13:52.809 --> 13:54.009
Are you sure?

13:54.077 --> 13:55.143
Of course.

13:55.211 --> 13:57.311
Thank you.

13:57.379 --> 14:00.513
Will you, uh, will you still have
time for the interview later?

14:00.581 --> 14:03.349
Yes. After the press conference.

14:03.416 --> 14:04.983
I'm looking forward to it, Mr. President.

14:05.051 --> 14:06.817
So am I.

14:10.154 --> 14:12.555
Reinstate Miss Reed's clearance.

14:12.623 --> 14:14.089
I was only...

14:14.157 --> 14:15.423
Just do it.

14:15.491 --> 14:18.593
Omar, people are starting to talk

14:18.661 --> 14:20.028
about you and this reporter.

14:20.095 --> 14:22.196
And saying what?

14:22.264 --> 14:24.065
Miss Reed is a journalist

14:24.132 --> 14:25.867
and she's profiling me for her newspaper.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.434
But you have feelings for her.

14:27.502 --> 14:28.902
I'm friendly with her.

14:28.970 --> 14:31.270
Think whatever you like.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.540
This woman poses no threat
to me or the peace process.

14:34.608 --> 14:37.510
Not here maybe, but back in our country

14:37.577 --> 14:39.578
you'll be torn apart.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.580
The mullahs will say that you
have been corrupted by the West.

14:42.648 --> 14:43.748
What do you say, Farhad?

14:43.816 --> 14:45.349
Have I?

14:45.417 --> 14:47.218
Have I been corrupted by the West?

14:47.285 --> 14:49.753
You know I don't believe that.

14:49.821 --> 14:52.622
But you are married.

14:52.690 --> 14:55.959
Dalia hasn't been a wife
to me for a long time.

14:56.027 --> 14:57.193
That's no excuse to be reckless.

14:57.261 --> 14:59.428
I've done nothing reckless.

14:59.495 --> 15:03.698
I've done nothing reckless.

15:03.766 --> 15:07.101
Just reinstate Miss Reed's clearance now.

15:08.770 --> 15:10.170
I'll see to it.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.313
(knocking on door)

15:36.692 --> 15:38.258
Victor.

15:38.326 --> 15:40.060
What are you doing here?

15:40.127 --> 15:41.894
How the hell did you find me?

15:41.962 --> 15:43.595
I was always resourceful, Jack.

15:43.663 --> 15:45.730
That's what you liked about me. Get in here.

15:45.798 --> 15:47.998
Take a seat.

15:48.066 --> 15:49.600
What happened?

15:49.668 --> 15:51.069
I need help.

15:51.136 --> 15:52.169
You need an ambulanc

15:52.237 --> 15:53.503
No, no, don't call.

15:53.571 --> 15:55.004
That's what he's waiting for.

15:55.072 --> 15:57.173
He's listening to the emergencchannels. Who?

15:57.240 --> 15:59.008
Just listen to me, Jack. I have information.

15:59.075 --> 16:01.676
The best I can do for you, Victor,
is get you an ambulance.

16:01.744 --> 16:03.912
I'm out. I don't work for
the government anymore.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.180
Oh, this you're going to want to hear.

16:05.248 --> 16:07.183
Why?

16:07.250 --> 16:10.418
Why? Because you're the guy who
always does the right thing.

16:10.486 --> 16:12.786
(gasping rapidly)

16:12.854 --> 16:14.687
There's a big hit going down.

16:14.755 --> 16:15.821
On who?

16:15.889 --> 16:16.822
President Hassan at the UN.

16:16.890 --> 16:17.823
He's getting taken out.

16:17.891 --> 16:20.093
When? Today.

16:20.194 --> 16:21.795
Before he can sign this thing with Taylor.

16:21.863 --> 16:24.263
(panting)

16:24.331 --> 16:26.632
You see? I told you you'd be interested.

16:26.699 --> 16:28.033
How do you know this?

16:28.100 --> 16:30.167
I'm the one that got the
hitter into the country.

16:30.235 --> 16:31.768
I've been setting him up with what he needs.

16:31.836 --> 16:33.202
And then he tried to take you out.

16:33.270 --> 16:34.770
Look, Jack, you're the only one

16:34.838 --> 16:36.539
at CTU I ever did business with.

16:36.606 --> 16:38.809
I need you to call them, vouch for me,

16:38.877 --> 16:41.145
so I can cut a deal.

16:41.213 --> 16:42.380
Come on, Jack.

16:42.448 --> 16:43.781
(groans) Keep your seat.

16:43.849 --> 16:45.283
Look, I swear, this is real.

16:45.351 --> 16:46.817
Someone is trying to make sure

16:46.885 --> 16:48.286
that this peace agreement does not happen.

16:48.354 --> 16:51.990
I'm not doing anything until
you give me your weapon.

16:52.057 --> 16:54.491
(panting)

16:56.928 --> 16:59.029
(groans) Better not be screwing with me.

16:59.096 --> 17:00.330
I'm not. I swear, I'm not.

17:00.397 --> 17:01.798
Who's the hitter? What's his name?

17:01.866 --> 17:02.932
Who's the hitter?!

17:03.000 --> 17:04.200
I don't know his name.

17:04.268 --> 17:05.800
He's Russian or something. Not good enough.

17:05.868 --> 17:07.536
Who is the hitter?! Look.

17:07.604 --> 17:11.240
I know how to find him and stop
him before he makes the hit.

17:11.308 --> 17:14.743
But I'm not saying another
word until I make my deal.

17:14.811 --> 17:17.480
(panting)

17:17.548 --> 17:19.548
You're lucky I'm retired.

17:41.469 --> 17:43.502
This is Cole Ortiz.

17:43.569 --> 17:45.169
Move Singer's team to the northeast

17:45.236 --> 17:46.837
quadnt, and tell him, from now on,

17:46.905 --> 17:48.373
I want updates every quarter hour.

17:48.441 --> 17:50.674
Get back to me with confirmations.

17:50.742 --> 17:52.342
Hastings wants you to
expand the patrol perimeter

17:52.410 --> 17:53.610
around the UN another quarter mile.

17:53.678 --> 17:54.811
I'm glad that's what he wants,

17:54.879 --> 17:56.412
but I barely have enough men to cover

17:56.480 --> 17:57.646
the perimeter now.

17:57.714 --> 17:59.915
I'll see if I can get
NYPD to help you cover.

17:59.982 --> 18:01.750
Uh, Dana?

18:01.817 --> 18:03.684
My sister--

18:03.751 --> 18:05.818
she said she lt you a couple of messages.

18:05.886 --> 18:06.952
Something about bridesmaids' dresses.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.286
I told her there was probably

18:08.354 --> 18:09.387
something wrong with your voicemail.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.855
I got her messages.

18:10.922 --> 18:12.856
I just haven't had a chance.
These double shifts...

18:12.924 --> 18:14.624
I revised the patrol protocols at the UN.

18:14.692 --> 18:16.092
Thought you might like

18:16.159 --> 18:17.593
to take a look at it before
I distributed it. Yeah.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.261
Yeah, I do. I will call your sister

18:19.329 --> 18:20.429
back, I promise.

18:20.496 --> 18:22.063
Thanks.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.902
Damn it, what is the problem?

18:29.538 --> 18:31.105
Percussive maintenance?

18:31.173 --> 18:32.573
That's what my network apps professor

18:32.608 --> 18:34.275
called it when I hit my computer.

18:34.343 --> 18:35.810
Can I help?

18:35.878 --> 18:37.645
I just got the revised attendee list

18:37.713 --> 18:39.213
for the press conference.
I can't get the facial

18:39.280 --> 18:40.547
recognition done in time.

18:40.615 --> 18:43.050
Oh, you're running each
person through individually.

18:43.117 --> 18:44.251
You can do them in a batch.

18:44.318 --> 18:46.386
Not if the data's in different formats.

18:46.454 --> 18:47.854
Well, that used to be true, but here.

18:52.827 --> 18:56.162
Like I said, there's no reon
to be shy out asking for help.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.297
Okay? Don't worry.

18:58.365 --> 18:59.632
You'll catch u You're doing great.

18:59.699 --> 19:00.866
(phone ringing)

19:00.934 --> 19:02.134
Excuse me.

19:03.702 --> 19:04.802
O'Brian.

19:04.870 --> 19:05.969
Chloe, it's Jack.

19:06.037 --> 19:07.270
Jack.

19:07.338 --> 19:08.972
How's Kim? Did you tell her about LA?

19:09.040 --> 19:10.273
Yeah, but I can't go into that right now.

19:10.341 --> 19:11.440
I need to speak to the director.

19:11.508 --> 19:14.041
Mr. Hastings is on the phone,

19:14.076 --> 19:16.275
and he really doesn't
like to be interrupted.

19:16.343 --> 19:17.609
Well, tell him it's regarding a plot

19:17.677 --> 19:18.609
to assassinate President Has

19:18.677 --> 19:20.242
See if that ts his attention.

19:20.309 --> 19:22.309
Oh. Okay, hold on.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.284
All right, now,
give me an overlay on the UN,

19:32.352 --> 19:33.785
view from the west.

19:33.853 --> 19:37.154
Now, overlay the distribution
of security teams, please.

19:37.222 --> 19:40.023
That looks good.

19:40.091 --> 19:43.292
Now, give me a comp with
incident reports and

19:43.360 --> 19:45.861
satellite imaging. Excuse me, Mr. Hastings.

19:45.929 --> 19:48.163
Gary, hold on for a second.

19:48.231 --> 19:50.098
Jack Bauer's on line three. He says he nds

19:50.166 --> 19:52.000
to talk to you. Bauer?

19:52.068 --> 19:53.434
It's about a plot against President Hassan.

19:53.469 --> 19:55.036
I thought you'd want to take the call.

19:57.105 --> 19:59.673
Gary, I'll call you back.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.709
Mr. Bauer, thiss Brn Hastgs.

20:03.777 --> 20:05.978
Mr. Hastings, I'm with an
informant that I used to run

20:06.046 --> 20:07.446
who's claiming he's got
intel on an assassination

20:07.514 --> 20:08.847
attempt on President Hassan.

20:08.915 --> 20:10.716
He says it's going to take place today.

20:10.783 --> 20:11.883
We've received several ats

20:11.951 --> 20:13.218
in regard to the peace conference.

20:13.285 --> 20:14.385
I can only imagine.

20:14.453 --> 20:15.553
My informant's name Victor Aruz.

20:15.621 --> 20:16.821
I used him in the Salazar op.

20:16.888 --> 20:18.656
You should be able to
pull his file Pull it up.

20:18.723 --> 20:20.657
He's been shot in the arm-
he claims byhe assassin.

20:20.725 --> 20:21.992
Look, I don't think

20:22.060 --> 20:23.960
this is something you should take lightly.

20:24.028 --> 20:27.730
And what does Mr. Aruz want
in return for his information?

20:27.798 --> 20:29.665
CTU protection and immunity.

20:29.733 --> 20:32.133
That's a lot to ask, Mr. Bauer.

20:32.201 --> 20:33.434
Have you pulled his file yet?

20:34.636 --> 20:36.336
No. JACK: Mr. Hastings,

20:36.404 --> 20:38.905
I know this son of a bitch,
and my instinct is telling me

20:38.972 --> 20:40.506
that you need to pay attention to this.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.074
I need more than your instinct, Mr. Bauer.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.578
CTU isn't the organization you knew.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.580
Okay, fine, but understand this:

20:47.648 --> 20:49.181
If anything happens to President Hassan,

20:49.249 --> 20:51.550
I will be obligated to call
President Taylor and tell her

20:51.618 --> 20:53.485
that I tried to provide you with this intel,

20:53.553 --> 20:56.187
and you ignored it.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.989
What is taking so long for the file?

20:58.056 --> 21:00.257
Sorry. I'm still searching
through the archives.

21:00.324 --> 21:02.592
Mr. Hastings, I need your answer now.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.593
Are you bringing Aruz in or not?

21:04.661 --> 21:06.661
(sighs)

21:08.664 --> 21:10.397
Let me talk to him.

21:10.465 --> 21:12.865
I'll put you on speaker.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.166
Go ahead.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.868
Mr. Aruz, I'm gonna need some other details

21:16.936 --> 21:18.336
to corroborate your story.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.970
The hitter took out two of my guys.

21:20.038 --> 21:21.171
Manuel Escobar and Mauricio Tellez.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.238
Check with t cops.

21:22.306 --> 21:24.073
We will.

21:24.140 --> 21:25.574
Mr. Bauer,

21:25.641 --> 21:26.741
where are you?

21:26.809 --> 21:28.242
1145 West 18th.

21:28.310 --> 21:30.343
I'll send a chopper to pick you up.

21:30.411 --> 21:31.711
The closest helipad

21:31.779 --> 21:34.179
to you is... the 12th precinct.

21:34.247 --> 21:35.547
That's five blocks away.

21:35.614 --> 21:36.681
Can you t him there,

21:36.749 --> 21:38.415
Mr. Bauer?

21:40.152 --> 21:42.455
Yeah.

21:42.522 --> 21:44.257
I'll have a team there in 20 minutes.

21:44.325 --> 21:46.093
Make sure you don't use official channels.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.795
We believe the assassin is
monitoring emergency bandwidth.

21:47.863 --> 21:49.298
Got it.

21:49.365 --> 21:54.403
Gather comm and tactical,
tell them we've got a situation.

21:54.471 --> 21:56.472
JACK: Let's go.

22:05.446 --> 22:06.746
There you are.

22:08.783 --> 22:10.717
Now that doesn't suck.

22:10.785 --> 22:11.718
Arlo.

22:11.786 --> 22:12.719
Yeah.

22:12.787 --> 22:14.487
Come on. Hastings called

22:14.555 --> 22:15.922
an emergency briefing.

22:15.990 --> 22:17.156
And if he ever catches you

22:17.224 --> 22:18.791
doing that, you're gonna be out of a job.

22:18.859 --> 22:20.126
Be worth it.

22:20.193 --> 22:21.627
I think this mig be love.

22:21.694 --> 22:22.627
Now.

22:22.695 --> 22:24.395
This is CTU

22:24.463 --> 22:27.464
transferring control of drones A31 and 32

22:27.531 --> 22:29.298
to HS aerial command.

22:29.366 --> 22:30.299
Yeah, roger that.

22:30.367 --> 22:31.833
Offload confirmed.

22:31.901 --> 22:33.535
l right, we've got a situation.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.070
Cole, I need you to scramble
a chopper for a pickup.

22:36.137 --> 22:37.104
Yeah. I haven't finished distributing

22:37.172 --> 22:38.105
the new patrol parameters.

22:38.173 --> 22:39.406
This is a priority.

22:39.473 --> 22:40.607
Who am I picking up?

22:40.674 --> 22:41.808
Someone who claims to have intel

22:41.875 --> 22:42.842
about a threat to President Hassan.

22:42.909 --> 22:45.243
How good is the intel?

22:45.310 --> 22:46.510
Well, according to Jack Bauer, very.

22:46.578 --> 22:47.845
Jack Bauer?

22:47.913 --> 22:49.279
He's delivering the informant.

22:49.347 --> 22:51.047
Who is Jack Bauer?

22:54.384 --> 22:55.985
Location downtown; Chloe's
sending you the coordinates.

22:56.052 --> 22:57.486
Take a small team with you.

22:57.554 --> 22:58.954
Torres' people are free.

22:59.022 --> 23:01.156
Yes, sir. And I'll need a second
team to secure the landing.

23:01.224 --> 23:03.092
One team will be enough. We'll use a drone

23:03.159 --> 23:04.594
to protect the ground operation.

23:04.661 --> 23:06.930
Arlo, scramble a drone
alongside the chopper.

23:06.998 --> 23:08.598
Full spectrum coverage of the landing zone

23:08.666 --> 23:11.002
as well as the air corridor.

23:11.069 --> 23:12.871
Done.

23:21.252 --> 23:23.553
(sirens wailing, horn blaring)

23:23.621 --> 23:24.721
(siren blips)

23:39.365 --> 23:40.565
We're clear.

23:46.637 --> 23:49.806
Dispatch, this is Unit 2354.

23:49.873 --> 23:52.041
DISPATCH: Go ahead, 2354.

23:52.109 --> 23:54.176
Got a plate match on a stolen vehicle.

23:54.243 --> 23:57.479
(various overlapping radio communications)

23:57.546 --> 23:58.946
(tuning in):...03 Pontiac.

23:59.014 --> 24:05.416
Plate: Sierra, November, Echo,
one, five, Charlie, five.

24:05.484 --> 24:07.117
Got bullet holes in the windshield and body.

24:07.185 --> 24:08.152
That's him.

24:08.219 --> 24:09.252
DISPATCH: Roger that.

24:09.320 --> 24:10.654
What's yr location?

24:10.721 --> 24:13.690
Vee's parked o18th,
just west of Ninth Avenue.

24:13.757 --> 24:15.591
We'll take care of it.

24:15.659 --> 24:16.692
Will you?

24:18.761 --> 24:20.628
Or am I going to have to step in?

24:22.297 --> 24:23.865
Now would be the time to tell me.

24:23.932 --> 24:25.699
Aruz is a dead man, sir.

24:25.767 --> 24:27.167
You have my word.

24:27.235 --> 24:29.403
Good.

24:54.231 --> 24:55.932
Thank you.

24:55.999 --> 24:56.998
Excuse me, Madam President.

24:58.900 --> 25:02.834
President Hassan accepted our
counterproposals on inspections.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.267
That is great news.

25:05.335 --> 25:07.068
By the end of this next session,

25:07.135 --> 25:08.836
we may have a signed agreement.

25:08.904 --> 25:13.006
It's an extraordinary
accomplishment, Allison.

25:13.074 --> 25:16.943
(sighing)

25:18.011 --> 25:20.379
Is something wrong?

25:20.447 --> 25:23.949
I was thinking about Henry.

25:24.017 --> 25:27.352
Achieving a comprehensive peace agreement

25:27.420 --> 25:29.654
with the Islamic Republic
was was something that

25:29.722 --> 25:31.623
he and I talked about years ago.

25:31.691 --> 25:36.762
I wish that he were here
to share the moment.

25:39.533 --> 25:41.634
You surprised?

25:41.702 --> 25:44.237
Considering his behavior during the divorce,

25:44.805 --> 25:46.972
yes, I am surprised.

25:47.039 --> 25:48.573
He went out of his way to hurt you,

25:48.641 --> 25:49.607
especially in the press.

25:49.675 --> 25:51.175
He was angry, Ethan.

25:51.243 --> 25:52.943
I sent our daughter to prison.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.944
You refused to cover up a murder.

25:55.012 --> 25:57.579
Olivia was responsible for what happened--

25:57.647 --> 25:58.881
no one else.

25:58.948 --> 26:01.416
Still, if the the situation
had been reversed,

26:01.484 --> 26:04.152
I might've felt the same way as Henry.

26:04.219 --> 26:05.953
Sorry if I'm interrupting, but I just talked

26:06.021 --> 26:07.087
to Brian Hastings at CTU.

26:07.155 --> 26:08.489
What's going on, Rob?

26:08.556 --> 26:10.524
They have someone who
claims he's got information

26:10.591 --> 26:12.292
about an assassination plot on Hassan.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.460
How real is the threat?

26:13.528 --> 26:14.728
Real enough to loop you in.

26:14.796 --> 26:16.597
This informant came to
them through Jack Bauer.

26:16.665 --> 26:17.932
I thought that

26:18.000 --> 26:20.135
Jack was out of all of this.
How did he get involved?

26:20.203 --> 26:22.170
As far as I can tell,
this informant came to him.

26:22.238 --> 26:24.139
We'll know more once the
informant signs an immunity deal,

26:24.207 --> 26:25.374
provided you authorize it.

26:25.442 --> 26:27.209
How secure is the venue
for the press conference?

26:27.277 --> 26:28.811
Very. And I just raised the alert level.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.614
But we need to set up a call to
inform Hassan about the threat,

26:31.681 --> 26:32.748
ideally before the conference gets started.

26:32.816 --> 26:33.915
We can't tell Hassan.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.250
<i>Certainly not before the press
conference.</i>

26:36.317 --> 26:37.517
Why not?

26:37.585 --> 26:40.186
Well, he might scuttle everything,
out of concern

26:40.254 --> 26:42.187
for his own safety. Hassan's a big boy.

26:42.255 --> 26:44.522
He's used to taking risks or he
wouldn't be here; you know that.

26:44.590 --> 26:47.190
Plus, if Hassan finds out we knew
about this and didn't tell him,

26:47.258 --> 26:48.658
then all the trust we've built up

26:48.726 --> 26:50.359
over the last year goes out the window,

26:50.427 --> 26:52.027
and then he'll pull out of talks.

26:52.095 --> 26:53.728
And frankly, I wouldn't blame him.

26:59.568 --> 27:01.001
I'll think about it.

27:01.069 --> 27:03.070
Thank you both.

27:09.744 --> 27:10.845
Madam President, I'm telling you,

27:10.913 --> 27:12.113
holding this back from Hassan

27:12.181 --> 27:13.815
could be disastrous.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.217
I said I'd think about it, Rob.

27:16.285 --> 27:17.318
Thank you.

27:30.766 --> 27:31.999
(sighs)

27:36.605 --> 27:38.539
Ethan...

27:38.607 --> 27:43.043
Listen-- sorry if I went after
you a little hard in there.

27:43.111 --> 27:44.978
Uh, I was just making my point.

27:45.046 --> 27:47.047
No need to apologize, Rob.

27:47.115 --> 27:48.615
I recommended you to the President

27:48.683 --> 27:51.351
<i>because you're not afraid
to speak up.</i>

27:51.419 --> 27:53.587
She needs that.

27:53.655 --> 27:56.823
Yeah, well, still,
I know I can get carried away; I...

27:56.891 --> 28:01.194
Don't worry, kid... I ain't dead yet.

28:01.262 --> 28:03.430
I can handle mysf.

28:03.498 --> 28:06.099
Even up against you.

28:14.909 --> 28:16.577
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

28:16.645 --> 28:19.513
Hey, we're almost finished packing.
Are you on your way?

28:19.580 --> 28:23.548
Something came up.
I'm gonna be a little late.

28:23.615 --> 28:24.682
How late?

28:24.750 --> 28:26.984
I think I should meet you at the airpo.

28:27.052 --> 28:27.985
Is everything okay?

28:28.053 --> 28:29.386
Yeah.

28:29.453 --> 28:30.720
Are you sure?

28:30.788 --> 28:32.688
Kim, I promise everything's fine.

28:32.756 --> 28:35.790
Well, Teri is so excited that
you're coming back with us.

28:35.858 --> 28:38.025
Just, uh, let me know
when you're on your way.

28:38.093 --> 28:40.160
Okay, thanks, sweetheart.

28:41.196 --> 28:42.563
Keep your eyes open.

28:42.631 --> 28:44.698
The precinct's two blocks away.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.432
Let's cut through here. Come on.

28:47.801 --> 28:49.801
The FAA's cleared a route and informed

28:49.869 --> 28:52.936
all relevant agencies that
we will be in the air.

28:54.138 --> 28:55.638
Good luck.

28:55.706 --> 28:58.209
Aruz's file-- it was in
a proprietary database.

28:58.277 --> 28:59.845
That's why it took so long.

28:59.912 --> 29:02.115
Still, that shouldn't have thrown you-
you've been here a month.

29:02.183 --> 29:04.653
Almost a month, and I've had
to relearn the interface

29:04.721 --> 29:06.488
on every major system here;
everything's changed.

29:06.556 --> 29:08.890
And you're having trouble adapting,
I understand.

29:08.957 --> 29:11.191
But I don't think it's a
question of your intelligence.

29:11.259 --> 29:12.626
Thanks.

29:12.694 --> 29:14.261
I think it's ambivalence.

29:14.328 --> 29:15.628
Ambivalence?!

29:15.696 --> 29:17.797
I know the only reason
you only took this job

29:17.865 --> 29:19.766
was because your husband was downsized.

29:19.833 --> 29:22.434
Am I wrong? No!

29:22.502 --> 29:23.669
I mean, yes.

29:23.737 --> 29:25.737
Please, just give me a little more time

29:25.805 --> 29:27.205
to get up to speed here.

29:28.607 --> 29:31.041
Mr. Hastings, I need this job.

29:32.076 --> 29:33.809
Fair enough.

29:33.877 --> 29:35.911
But I'm all about efficiency, so if your

29:35.978 --> 29:37.145
performance doesn't improve,

29:37.213 --> 29:38.679
you may want to rethink working here.

29:38.747 --> 29:42.450
Now, I trust this has been clarifying.

29:42.518 --> 29:44.619
Sure.

29:44.687 --> 29:46.254
If you really wanted to be more efficient,

29:46.322 --> 29:47.656
why don't you just say

29:47.724 --> 29:49.892
if I don't catch up soon,
I'm going to be fired?

29:57.102 --> 29:58.903
Your flight path is a straight shot

29:58.969 --> 30:00.535
southwest over the river,
and the 12th Precinct

30:00.603 --> 30:03.003
has confirmed that their helipad is clear

30:03.071 --> 30:04.738
and operational.
Comm net and satellite coverage

30:04.806 --> 30:05.872
of your flight, both legs,

30:05.940 --> 30:07.307
and full-time aerial from the drone--

30:07.374 --> 30:09.041
Why are you looking at me like that?

30:09.109 --> 30:11.343
Like what?

30:12.846 --> 30:15.380
Look, I just want to make
sure nothing's wrong.

30:16.415 --> 30:17.548
Nothing's wrong,

30:17.615 --> 30:19.515
like I said.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.950
Just be careful, okay?

30:22.018 --> 30:23.351
I will be.

30:23.419 --> 30:24.485
You ready?

30:24.553 --> 30:26.220
Yeah.

30:29.456 --> 30:32.325
You know, maybe she
should finally set a date.

30:32.392 --> 30:33.726
She's getting cold feet.

30:33.794 --> 30:34.894
How about you shut up

30:34.962 --> 30:37.063
and just focus on your assignment?

30:58.151 --> 31:00.218
(labored breathing)

31:00.286 --> 31:01.453
Come on, Victor!

31:04.257 --> 31:05.824
Victor? Victor!

31:05.892 --> 31:07.159
Stay with me.

31:07.226 --> 31:08.693
Victor, stay with me!

31:08.761 --> 31:09.861
Stay with...

31:10.996 --> 31:13.164
Damn it.

31:13.231 --> 31:15.232
(grunts)

31:21.473 --> 31:23.473
(groaning)

31:42.961 --> 31:44.728
Stay with me!

31:46.430 --> 31:48.730
We're going to need to recompress the wound.

32:08.924 --> 32:11.559
TV REPORTER: If successful,
the agreement could be the beginning

32:11.626 --> 32:13.761
of a real lasting peace in a lon
g-troubled region.

32:13.828 --> 32:16.396
Presidents Taylor and Hassan

32:16.464 --> 32:18.198
are scheduled to give their first joint

32:18.265 --> 32:21.134
press conference in just
a few minutes, and we'll

32:21.201 --> 32:22.268
carry that live.

32:22.336 --> 32:24.203
In a moment, Christiane Doumany will have

32:24.270 --> 32:26.871
a report on the history of
the many failed attempts

32:26.939 --> 32:28.339
at a Mideast peace,

32:28.407 --> 32:30.308
and why this accord may be different.

32:30.376 --> 32:31.709
(turns off TV)

32:33.611 --> 32:35.578
It's time to go.

32:35.646 --> 32:37.781
Tell your father I'll be right there.

32:37.849 --> 32:40.386
I'll wait until you're done.

32:42.422 --> 32:44.690
He doesn't trust me to be on time.

32:44.758 --> 32:46.958
Of course he trusts you.

32:53.999 --> 32:57.401
When did you become such a good liar?

32:59.470 --> 33:01.638
You don't have to defend your father, Dalia.

33:05.476 --> 33:07.477
He can take care of himself.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.860
You look beautiful, Dalia.

33:22.927 --> 33:24.528
And you look handsome.

33:28.734 --> 33:30.835
Let's not pretend any more than we have to.

33:39.713 --> 33:42.081
I'm sorry you had to see that.

33:42.148 --> 33:44.016
It's not your fault.

33:48.356 --> 33:50.558
My dear Kayla.

33:52.728 --> 33:54.195
We should go.

33:55.231 --> 33:56.231
Yes.

34:14.938 --> 34:16.938
(indistinct background conversation)

34:25.213 --> 34:26.580
Let her through.

34:28.716 --> 34:30.282
(beep)

34:41.025 --> 34:42.125
Thank you.

34:42.193 --> 34:45.228
I will tell you the same
thing that I told him.

34:45.295 --> 34:47.228
Unless you want to destroy

34:47.295 --> 34:51.029
everything that he's worked for,
stay away from him.

35:02.869 --> 35:04.369
Excuse me, ma'am.

35:05.503 --> 35:07.003
President Hassan is on his way.

35:11.206 --> 35:13.206
You're not going to tell
him he's being targeted.

35:13.274 --> 35:15.508
Madam President, I'm sorry.

35:15.576 --> 35:17.676
You risk destroying in a
single day all the-- Rob,

35:17.744 --> 35:19.110
you've made your point.

35:19.178 --> 35:20.344
More than once.

35:20.412 --> 35:22.214
And believe me, I don't like keeping this

35:22.281 --> 35:24.050
from President Hassan any more than you do.

35:24.118 --> 35:25.251
Then tell him.

35:31.423 --> 35:32.422
Mr. President.

35:32.490 --> 35:34.024
Ladies.

35:35.593 --> 35:37.394
You've met my chief of staff?

35:37.461 --> 35:38.394
Of course.

35:38.462 --> 35:39.762
Hello, Mr. President.

35:39.830 --> 35:42.865
I haven't had the chance to
thank you for compromising

35:42.933 --> 35:44.299
on the verification issue.

35:45.635 --> 35:47.869
It was the right thing to do.

35:47.937 --> 35:49.538
If you don't mind,

35:49.605 --> 35:50.939
I'd like to brief you both

35:51.006 --> 35:52.774
on the format of the press conference.

35:52.842 --> 35:54.609
The Secretary-General will be introducing

35:54.677 --> 35:56.545
you both after some brief remarks.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.513
The conference itself
shouldn't take any longer

35:58.581 --> 36:00.382
than 25 minutes or so.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.252
(yelling)

36:03.319 --> 36:05.153
Put your hand on it.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.539
Let's go.

36:07.606 --> 36:09.073
We're almost there.

36:09.141 --> 36:10.475
MAN: Don't move!

36:10.543 --> 36:12.310
Got a call that you two are having

36:12.378 --> 36:13.745
a problem down here. What's up?

36:13.813 --> 36:15.180
Officer, my name is Jack Bauer.

36:15.214 --> 36:17.315
I'm transporting this man on behalf of CTU.

36:17.382 --> 36:18.616
He's an informant vital

36:18.683 --> 36:19.816
to national security.

36:19.884 --> 36:21.751
Call it in. Listen to me.

36:21.819 --> 36:23.386
The men that are trying to kill him

36:23.454 --> 36:24.854
are monitoring all emergency channels.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.422
Do not let him make that call.

36:26.490 --> 36:27.723
Shut up and get against the Dumpster.

36:27.790 --> 36:28.990
Now!

36:29.058 --> 36:30.425
At least take us into the precinct.

36:30.493 --> 36:32.660
We can verify everything there.

36:32.728 --> 36:35.496
Get down, now!

36:35.563 --> 36:37.831
(heavy gunfire)

36:49.308 --> 36:50.809
Damn it!

36:56.315 --> 36:57.015
I'm going to cover you.

36:57.083 --> 36:58.117
Make a run for the door.

36:58.184 --> 36:59.717
You ready? Go! Go!

37:05.055 --> 37:06.821
I'm out of bullets.

37:09.224 --> 37:11.357
Chloe, it's Jack.
How far out is the helicopter?

37:11.425 --> 37:12.658
Two minutes. Jack, what's wrong?

37:12.726 --> 37:13.859
We're under attack.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.193
I need you to put me in touch

37:15.261 --> 37:16.394
with whoever's in command of that unit.

37:16.462 --> 37:17.495
Okay. It's Agent Ortiz.

37:17.563 --> 37:18.796
He's the head of field ops.

37:18.864 --> 37:20.564
Is there a problem? Yes.

37:20.632 --> 37:23.633
Mr. Hastings, we have a
situation with the pickup.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.201
Keep going to the roof. Now.

37:25.268 --> 37:26.201
Don't stop for anything.

37:26.269 --> 37:27.569
Keep going.

37:29.305 --> 37:31.538
Agent Ortiz, you're on with
Jack Bauer. ORTIZ: Roger.

37:31.606 --> 37:32.973
What's going on, Mr. Bauer?

37:33.041 --> 37:34.374
We're being pursued by two shooters.

37:34.441 --> 37:36.242
There's no way we're going
to make the precinct.

37:36.310 --> 37:37.876
We're in a building on West 21st,

37:37.944 --> 37:39.344
three doors in from Ninth Avenue.

37:41.379 --> 37:43.346
We're heaWe're lookingposition
for an alternate pickup.ne.

37:43.414 --> 37:45.514
Copy that.

37:53.453 --> 37:56.521
Right there-- the roof of that
parking structure might work.

37:56.589 --> 37:57.522
Can you zoom in closer?

37:57.589 --> 37:58.523
The satellite's refreshing.

37:58.590 --> 37:59.524
It'll take a minute.

37:59.592 --> 38:01.493
I'm moving the drone there now.

38:01.561 --> 38:02.562
There's a parking structure next

38:02.629 --> 38:03.596
to the building you're in.

38:03.664 --> 38:04.664
Roof looks clear to land.

38:04.732 --> 38:05.865
DANA: Did you get that, Cole?

38:05.933 --> 38:07.834
Yeah, I see it. Mr. Bauer,

38:07.902 --> 38:09.671
looks like you can access that roof

38:09.739 --> 38:11.342
from the eighth floor of
the building you're in.

38:11.409 --> 38:13.077
How far out are you? 90 seconds.

38:13.145 --> 38:14.446
Copy that.

38:14.513 --> 38:15.980
Don't be late.

38:20.019 --> 38:22.053
Victor... Victor, listen to me.

38:22.121 --> 38:23.921
You got to tell me everything
you know about the hitter,

38:23.989 --> 38:24.956
so I can call it in

38:25.023 --> 38:26.324
in case we don't make it.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.359
If I don't make it,
I don't care what happens.

38:28.427 --> 38:30.895
Get me to CTU.

38:33.665 --> 38:35.065
You always were a son of a bitch.

38:35.133 --> 38:37.567
Come on.

38:51.184 --> 38:52.652
(groans)

39:05.266 --> 39:06.266
Come on.

39:06.334 --> 39:07.801
Let's go.

39:10.205 --> 39:11.338
Stay there.

39:31.525 --> 39:34.160
Lock down access points to the roof!

39:36.396 --> 39:38.431
Where are the hostiles? They're dead.

39:38.498 --> 39:41.333
You need to get him out of here.
He's losing a lot of blood.

39:41.401 --> 39:43.001
Cole Ortiz. It's an honor to meet you.

39:43.069 --> 39:44.269
Thanks for doing this.

39:44.337 --> 39:46.171
Look, Hastings wants to
debrief you back at CTU.

39:46.239 --> 39:48.006
I'm not going back to CTU.
I delivered him, I'm done.

39:48.074 --> 39:50.843
No, Mr. Bauer... I got a flight to catch.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.511
That's it?

39:54.680 --> 39:55.747
Get down!

40:09.527 --> 40:11.794
Ortiz, report in.

40:11.862 --> 40:13.395
CHLOE: Agent Ortiz?

40:17.199 --> 40:18.499
Agent Ortiz, what's your status?

40:20.602 --> 40:22.903
Agent Ortiz?

40:22.971 --> 40:25.705
Jack, come in.

40:25.773 --> 40:27.374
Jack, can you hear me?

40:27.441 --> 40:30.009
Anyone, come in.

40:32.746 --> 40:34.380
(panting)

40:37.884 --> 40:39.051
Victor.

40:39.119 --> 40:41.686
Victor, Victor, come on.

40:41.754 --> 40:43.387
Stay with me, stay with me.

40:43.455 --> 40:44.455
Listen to me.

40:44.522 --> 40:45.823
You don't want to die like this.

40:45.890 --> 40:48.158
Do the right thing.

40:48.259 --> 40:49.392
Tell me what you know.

40:51.427 --> 40:53.794
The hitter has someone on the inside.

40:55.597 --> 40:58.164
Close to Hassan.

40:58.232 --> 41:00.233
Give me a name

41:00.301 --> 41:02.435
Give me a name. Give me a name!

41:02.503 --> 41:03.503
(coughs)

41:03.570 --> 41:04.770
Victor...

41:04.838 --> 41:05.905
Victor, who's on the inside?

41:05.973 --> 41:08.174
Victor!

41:08.242 --> 41:09.275
Come on.

41:09.343 --> 41:10.978
Come on, come on.

41:12.814 --> 41:15.615
No.

41:18.786 --> 41:20.754
He's dead.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.858
(grunts)

41:28.796 --> 41:30.530
No.

41:30.597 --> 41:32.098
The brother revoked my clearance,

41:32.166 --> 41:34.233
but I had Hassan reinstate it.

41:34.268 --> 41:36.669
No, I know.

41:36.737 --> 41:38.805
I know I'm behind schedule.

41:38.873 --> 41:41.108
But it'll get done.
